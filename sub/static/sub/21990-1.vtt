00:32.674 --> 00:36.299
<i>Yesterday, Japanese Consulate
at Shanghai was attacked.</i>

00:36.300 --> 00:40.340
<i>Since Japanese cotton mill in Shanghai
killed workers on June 5th,</i>

00:40.341 --> 00:41.882
<i>Triggering strike movement,</i>

00:42.175 --> 00:45.007
<i>Shanghai University
students support the strike,</i>

00:45.008 --> 00:49.424
<i>launching donation and
demonstration in concession.</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:53.174
<i>They crashed with police.</i>

00:53.300 --> 00:56.632
<i>On 3:00 p.m, yesterday,
at Nanjing Road west,</i>

00:56.633 --> 01:02.340
<i>police shot dead 7 students
injuring several others.</i>

01:03.091 --> 01:06.947
<i>It's unprecedented since the
beginning of national movement.</i>

01:07.175 --> 01:12.674
<i>Workers and students were so angry
to rush to the Japanese Consulate,</i>

01:13.258 --> 01:15.840
<i>upgrading the contradiction.</i>

01:53.216 --> 01:55.882
Zihao! Save me, Zihao!

02:17.633 --> 02:21.424
<i>Cruel torture, it temporarily
helps me forget the pain.</i>

02:21.883 --> 02:24.257
<i>Forget those unforgettable memories.</i>

02:24.966 --> 02:27.799
<i>The only thing
Shanghai bund brings me is pain.</i>

02:30.758 --> 02:33.257
<i>Organization,
hope...</i>

02:33.508 --> 02:34.507
<i>Where are they?</i>

02:37.300 --> 02:40.757
<i>My god, help me.</i>

02:41.508 --> 02:42.674
<i>I want to escape.</i>

02:44.008 --> 02:45.840
<i>I want all these things come to an end.</i>

03:31.216 --> 03:32.382
Catch him!

03:52.175 --> 03:53.090
Catch him!

03:53.091 --> 03:53.840
Stop!

06:15.716 --> 06:18.507
Young Lord Fang, all the best.

06:26.508 --> 06:30.757
Young Lord, we are
here to bid farewell.

07:23.341 --> 07:24.924
All the best on your way.

07:37.633 --> 07:38.674
Someone escaped from prison!

07:39.008 --> 07:40.132
Don't let him go!

07:43.258 --> 07:44.549
Hurry, he is up there!

07:44.550 --> 07:45.174
Hurry, hurry.

08:05.758 --> 08:06.840
What are you looking at?

08:07.508 --> 08:08.924
Let me borrow your room.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.382
Let's rush in!

08:19.800 --> 08:21.382
Wake up, wake up!

08:34.091 --> 08:35.215
You are good at kung fu.

08:40.216 --> 08:40.840
They are up there!

08:41.383 --> 08:43.090
Hurry!
Don't let them go!

08:45.175 --> 08:46.632
What's wrong with you?

08:47.716 --> 08:49.299
Catch him!
Don't let him go!

08:49.591 --> 08:50.549
Catch them!

08:59.341 --> 09:00.382
Stop! Don't move!

09:09.716 --> 09:10.549
Stop!

09:23.675 --> 09:24.090
Stop!

09:24.091 --> 09:25.049
Beat them!

09:42.466 --> 09:45.215
Yes, beat them to death.

09:51.050 --> 09:52.090
You are courting death.

09:55.508 --> 09:56.007
Stop! Don't move!

09:56.008 --> 09:56.965
Don't let them go!

09:59.466 --> 10:00.090
Don't move.

10:01.091 --> 10:02.132
You have nowhere to run.

10:03.633 --> 10:04.299
Stop!

10:04.550 --> 10:05.424
Don't run!

10:09.258 --> 10:09.840
Don't move!

10:26.258 --> 10:26.965
Hurry. Don't move!

10:31.091 --> 10:33.132
Good, good, good.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.299
Well done, brother.

10:34.883 --> 10:36.840
There they are.

10:46.591 --> 10:50.757
Run, run, run!

11:25.258 --> 11:26.424
What do you mean?

11:26.425 --> 11:28.007
Do you know who I am?

11:28.925 --> 11:30.465
I'm a big shot in Shanghai bund.

11:30.925 --> 11:32.090
You want me to jump?

11:32.300 --> 11:34.215
How can I live in
Shanghai bund in the future?

11:34.716 --> 11:35.632
Don't let them go!

11:36.425 --> 11:37.840
Hurry, hurry up!

11:52.383 --> 11:55.132
<i>Just like the bright moon
in sunset and cloud,</i>

11:59.466 --> 12:05.132
<i>Silent night takes away noisy.</i>

12:06.175 --> 12:11.090
<i>Just like oriole's songs arouse spring,</i>

12:11.800 --> 12:17.049
<i>It's the songs and dances highlight
the beautiful night.</i>

12:25.050 --> 12:28.174
You must be surprise to see me,
Tang Hexuan, still alive.

12:29.383 --> 12:30.882
Today I come here to meet you.

12:31.341 --> 12:32.799
I'm so lucky.

12:33.758 --> 12:39.174
I don't know who found
some bullies, to attack me.

12:41.508 --> 12:43.674
Today I escape from death.

12:44.258 --> 12:46.424
Otherwise, the one who
fell down the car was me.

12:46.425 --> 12:51.382
<i>If there's still love,
don't waste your time.</i>

12:52.014 --> 12:58.226
Which wharf owner is so bold
to plot against Mr. Tang.

12:58.227 --> 13:00.873
Does he want to die?

13:00.874 --> 13:04.892
Come on, please toast.

13:04.893 --> 13:06.697
Let's help Mr. Tang get over the shock.

13:06.698 --> 13:09.086
Thank you, Mr. Ye. Don't laugh at me.

13:09.087 --> 13:11.339
But everyone, please think carefully.

13:11.508 --> 13:13.094
Even if Xiang Yu had
another 1,000 chances,

13:13.095 --> 13:16.783
he couldn't beat Liu Bang.

13:16.784 --> 13:19.948
That's the difference
between hero and bandit.

13:19.949 --> 13:22.400
So many years in Shanghai bund...

13:22.401 --> 13:25.591
Many heroes wanted to take my life.

13:26.216 --> 13:27.840
They all died.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.215
Oh my god.
It's so smelly.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.174
Are you mute?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.174
I help you escape.
You didn't even say "thank you".

14:08.175 --> 14:09.090
What are you looking at?

14:15.550 --> 14:16.465
Run!

15:07.900 --> 15:09.299
You are chivalrous.

15:09.675 --> 15:10.840
I didn't back the wrong horse.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.007
You are good at driving.

15:16.675 --> 15:19.007
But let me tell you, your driving
skill is a little bit worse than me.

15:23.550 --> 15:25.674
It's a nice cloth, how did you get it?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.257
Hey.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.674
I just praised you.
What's wrong with you?

15:42.883 --> 15:44.465
We are playing.
Don't get killed!

17:09.050 --> 17:10.382
Come on.

17:10.383 --> 17:12.007
Come, come.

17:14.883 --> 17:15.589
Stop.

17:16.425 --> 17:17.632
Let me bring you some happiness.

17:18.965 --> 17:20.089
Are you really Young Lord Fang?

17:20.090 --> 17:20.674
Of course.

17:21.008 --> 17:22.257
Are you really Young Lord Fang?

17:22.258 --> 17:23.257
Come on.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.174
Bo the whole second floor for me.

17:27.215 --> 17:28.089
Get off.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.007
Come and relax.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.965
Comfort my brother.

17:32.175 --> 17:32.924
Let him happy.

17:34.258 --> 17:35.674
Where are you going?

18:10.300 --> 18:11.215
Father.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.465
Ye is so cruel this time.

18:14.050 --> 18:16.507
He wanted to kill me in prison.

18:16.966 --> 18:18.549
How dare him.

18:18.550 --> 18:19.924
Should I let him go die.

18:23.383 --> 18:24.965
Jie, as long as you are back.

18:26.883 --> 18:27.924
How do you know Ye did that?

18:31.091 --> 18:32.924
Why you deploy so many
people in the yard?

18:32.925 --> 18:33.715
Ask them to leave.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.049
Father.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.299
Dragon begets dragon,
phoenix begets phoenix.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.959
Mouse's son can beat...

20:46.960 --> 20:49.123
Mouse? No, no.

20:50.341 --> 20:53.340
Let me tell you,
all people in Shanghai bund know...

20:54.091 --> 20:55.549
We are perfect match.

20:59.008 --> 20:59.840
You are crow in the sky.

21:02.050 --> 21:03.715
No, not crow.

21:04.341 --> 21:07.174
You are phoenix in the sky.
Fly and fly.

21:09.925 --> 21:10.632
I am...

21:10.633 --> 21:11.632
Young Lord!

21:12.175 --> 21:13.090
The lady comes.

21:13.175 --> 21:14.840
-Does she arrive?
-There she is.

21:15.591 --> 21:17.090
Don't laugh!

21:42.133 --> 21:42.965
You are back.

21:44.258 --> 21:45.257
We've been apart for two years.

21:45.258 --> 21:46.507
You look the same.

21:46.591 --> 21:48.132
You are still so inattentive.

21:50.008 --> 21:50.799
Who will you send the flower to?

21:51.425 --> 21:51.882
No, not crow. The flower is for you.

21:58.466 --> 21:58.882
Thank you.

21:59.883 --> 22:00.882
Let's go.

22:01.050 --> 22:01.882
Is it too late for the movie?

22:02.591 --> 22:03.465
I have booked the whole Guotai cinema.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.132
Take it easy. We won't be late.

22:06.383 --> 22:07.965
I didn't expect that
Hepburn's Alice Adams

22:08.008 --> 22:09.757
is shown earlier in
Shanghai than Britain.

22:10.550 --> 22:11.924
I admire Hepburn.

22:12.675 --> 22:14.465
I think she is pretty and sexy.

22:15.008 --> 22:16.549
What are you talking about?

22:17.008 --> 22:18.132
What is that?

22:18.758 --> 22:20.507
I find you are really uncultured.

22:20.800 --> 22:21.799
I don't want to talk with you.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.174
You are so romantic.

22:42.341 --> 22:42.799
You pick me up with
an antique carriage.

22:47.508 --> 22:48.424
I'm Fang Jie.

22:49.841 --> 22:51.257
Here you are. Your present.

22:55.258 --> 22:56.049
A dog?

22:57.758 --> 22:59.007
Aren't you born in the year of the dog?

22:59.258 --> 23:01.007
Look, how it looks like you.

23:02.925 --> 23:05.049
Ok, I receive it, reluctantly.

23:05.758 --> 23:06.424
Thank you.

23:06.675 --> 23:08.132
Well, how is my father?

23:08.591 --> 23:09.215
He is fine.

23:09.383 --> 23:10.340
He misses you very much.

23:11.258 --> 23:12.174
Just like me.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.257
Why doesn't he come and pick me up?

23:14.800 --> 23:16.132
He has a meeting in
the Municipal Council.

23:16.758 --> 23:17.799
So he asked me to pick you up.

23:18.508 --> 23:20.090
He must be waiting for you at home now.

23:21.466 --> 23:22.924
Recently, the
Shanghai bund is not peaceful.

23:23.508 --> 23:24.757
In Suzhou River,

23:25.008 --> 23:26.549
there are many dead bodies.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.049
Their faces are ruined.

23:51.716 --> 23:52.965
Qianqian.

23:57.800 --> 23:58.632
Let me go.

24:35.008 --> 24:36.382
You cheat!

26:03.175 --> 26:04.674
Closer!

26:42.216 --> 26:43.424
Go away.

26:44.966 --> 26:46.424
Go away, go away.

27:48.783 --> 27:51.138
Run, run.

28:07.693 --> 28:09.465
Run, run.

30:12.550 --> 30:14.299
There won't be such things anymore.

30:16.341 --> 30:17.549
Thanks to him today.

30:18.383 --> 30:19.965
Come, see my father.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.465
He saved me right now.

30:25.425 --> 30:27.882
This is Mr. Tang, my father.

30:34.008 --> 30:36.215
It won't happen anymore.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.590
Never.

30:49.091 --> 30:51.882
Zihao! Save me, Zihao!

31:11.216 --> 31:11.924
Father.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.965
I think those people
are not from Shanghai bund.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.840
I don't know where are those mobs come.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.132
There are so many mobs.

31:19.466 --> 31:20.549
Why not challenge me one on one.

31:20.550 --> 31:22.007
I'll let them all go die.

31:29.008 --> 31:30.382
Thanks for his timely help.

31:30.383 --> 31:33.715
If he doesn't help,
you won't sit here boasting.

31:39.341 --> 31:40.507
Thank you.

31:42.258 --> 31:43.465
My dinner

31:43.716 --> 31:45.132
will be Meng Po Tang
(tea of forgetfulness).

31:45.883 --> 31:48.007
What? Meng Po Niang?
(dream of other girls)

31:49.341 --> 31:52.507
Except from you,
I never dream of other girls.

31:52.841 --> 31:55.215
Daddy, listen to what he says.

31:56.675 --> 31:58.757
Today is my family reunion.

32:01.008 --> 32:02.674
It's a happy day.

32:03.425 --> 32:05.507
Let's propose a toast to...

32:09.032 --> 32:11.220
It's my fault.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.459
I forgot to ask the hero's name.

32:17.075 --> 32:19.174
Father, he is mute.

32:19.383 --> 32:20.007
He can't speak.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.215
Li Zihao,

32:25.841 --> 32:29.299
Mr. Tang, my name is Li Zihao.

32:36.133 --> 32:40.840
One sparrow, one head.

32:41.675 --> 32:46.715
Two eyes go round and round.

32:47.425 --> 32:52.257
Two wings, two feet.

32:53.091 --> 32:58.007
One tail crooked.

33:01.841 --> 33:03.215
-Daddy.
-Good.

33:04.008 --> 33:05.882
You sing as good as your mother did.

33:08.008 --> 33:09.299
This time you come back,

33:11.758 --> 33:13.299
I find you have grown up.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.424
-More and more pretty.
-No, elegant.

33:22.216 --> 33:23.424
Just like my mother?

33:24.758 --> 33:25.882
In near future,

33:26.966 --> 33:29.049
Dad will hold a ball for you.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.090
You must be the highlight of the ball.

33:34.383 --> 33:36.007
Just like my mother?

33:39.341 --> 33:43.674
Daddy, I miss my mom.

33:49.758 --> 33:51.257
How did she die?

33:54.758 --> 33:56.007
It's been a long time.

33:56.883 --> 33:58.882
Why you still don't want to tell me?

34:05.800 --> 34:06.757
Daddy.

34:08.175 --> 34:11.507
Do you remember 10 years ago,
the day of your mother's birthday?

34:13.841 --> 34:15.632
Your mother hided you.

34:16.507 --> 34:18.215
I thought you were lost.

34:19.632 --> 34:21.840
I found you in the whole Shanghai.

34:23.425 --> 34:26.299
It's just a joke by me and my mom,
to make you happy.

34:27.175 --> 34:29.007
You are so boring.

34:29.550 --> 34:33.049
You were so angry,
just because of a joke.

34:34.007 --> 34:38.132
Only you two,
dare to play a trick with me.

34:41.300 --> 34:43.132
I can't bear that kind of joke.

34:44.800 --> 34:45.674
Daddy,

34:47.466 --> 34:48.674
this time I come back.

34:50.007 --> 34:51.465
I can feel that you are not happy.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.715
As long as you are with me.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.049
My only wish is you are happy forever.

34:59.966 --> 35:01.424
I'm not a monkey.

35:02.133 --> 35:04.090
How can I be happy forever?

35:05.050 --> 35:06.465
Others could not.

35:07.925 --> 35:09.090
But you can.

35:12.216 --> 35:15.507
Why not let Li Zihao
protect me, the little monkey.

35:16.758 --> 35:18.924
You are as same as your
mother when she was young.

35:19.633 --> 35:21.132
You have no secret.

35:21.633 --> 35:23.382
What you say are always
your inner most feelings.

35:23.383 --> 35:24.424
Daddy!

35:34.675 --> 35:36.840
Li Zihao is 24 years old.
He is from Peking.

35:36.841 --> 35:38.382
A student of St. Johns College.

35:38.925 --> 35:40.113
Last year in the
Japanese Concession,

35:40.114 --> 35:42.827
he was the leader of
415 student movement.

35:43.091 --> 35:44.674
Later, he was put into
the No. 1 prison.

35:45.175 --> 35:46.757
He took a tough stance,

35:47.633 --> 35:49.799
refusing to reveal where
were other radicals.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.757
This time in order to
solve his prison break,

36:08.216 --> 36:09.882
we've spent much in the concession.

36:11.008 --> 36:12.340
We didn't find out any relationship

36:12.550 --> 36:14.382
between Li Zihao and
the Blue Shirts Society.

36:15.050 --> 36:19.424
My Lord, could we just wait.
We can have a double check.

36:20.008 --> 36:23.715
I can't wait.
I'm eager for talents.

36:25.425 --> 36:29.590
I don't care whether he is reliable.
I only care whether he is useful to me.

36:55.591 --> 36:57.340
This is Li Zihao.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.090
My new foster son.

37:02.841 --> 37:04.382
-Young Lord!
-Young Lord!

37:12.591 --> 37:13.799
Mr. Tang,

37:15.008 --> 37:17.507
what on earth do
you want me to do?

37:20.091 --> 37:22.799
I want you to kill me,

37:23.633 --> 37:24.549
in front of all the
gangs of Shanghai bund.

37:29.841 --> 37:32.340
Since I entered the
French Concession,

37:32.466 --> 37:35.257
and wanted to shut down
the opium business.

37:36.466 --> 37:38.340
Shanghai bund is not peaceful.

37:40.091 --> 37:44.507
Consul General of French Concession
Owen and Hong Men's Ye Qishan

37:46.508 --> 37:48.132
wanted to kill me.

37:52.925 --> 37:54.132
Why chose me?

37:56.466 --> 37:58.049
I don't believe in anybody.

38:00.300 --> 38:04.007
Do you trust me?

38:22.008 --> 38:22.840
No problem.

38:23.508 --> 38:24.340
It all depends on you.

38:24.800 --> 38:25.799
Come, cheers.

38:25.800 --> 38:26.424
Cheers.

38:38.383 --> 38:39.257
Do you like it?

38:41.300 --> 38:43.924
This is Shanghai bund.
A place everybody dreams of.

38:45.008 --> 38:45.799
Heaven.

39:25.966 --> 39:26.965
Mr Tang.

39:28.341 --> 39:29.632
What do you mean?

39:31.383 --> 39:33.465
I want to invite you
listening to the music.

39:55.883 --> 39:58.215
<i>If fallen leaves</i>

39:59.591 --> 40:01.924
<i>Deep into the wind</i>

40:04.008 --> 40:09.632
<i>I turn around</i>

40:10.466 --> 40:12.799
<i>Who says farewell</i>

40:13.800 --> 40:16.132
<i>Is always sad</i>

40:17.758 --> 40:24.257
<i>Close your eyes, it's still us.</i>

40:42.341 --> 40:49.049
<i>Time passes dawn and dusk</i>

41:04.466 --> 41:11.257
<i>Will be remembered a lifetime</i>

41:11.883 --> 41:18.132
<i>Do you still remember</i>

41:18.133 --> 41:22.132
<i>What's your promises in young age?</i>

41:22.133 --> 41:23.632
From this moment,

41:23.633 --> 41:25.799
you are members of the
Blue Shirts Society.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.257
You are comrades in the same trench.

41:28.716 --> 41:32.340
Obey orders, devote to duties,
dare to sacrifice.

41:32.591 --> 41:35.174
resolutely to complete tasks
given by the organization.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.155
-I promise to be faithful.
-I promise to be faithful.

41:37.156 --> 41:39.632
-Obey the leader, devote to the duties.
-Obey the leader, devote to the duties.

41:39.633 --> 41:42.257
-Spare no effort to fulfill tasks.
-Spare no effort to fulfill tasks.

41:42.258 --> 41:45.882
-Devote my whole life to the organization.
-Devote my whole life to the organization.

41:49.050 --> 41:51.632
What's wrong with you?
Are you ok?

41:51.883 --> 41:54.215
<i>Deep into the wind</i>

41:56.425 --> 42:02.132
<i>I turn around</i>

42:03.008 --> 42:05.340
<i>Who says farewell</i>

42:06.258 --> 42:08.674
<i>Is always sad</i>

42:09.675 --> 42:13.007
<i>Close your eyes,</i>

42:22.091 --> 42:25.382
<i>It's still us.</i>

42:34.716 --> 42:35.840
Mr. Tang.

42:37.050 --> 42:39.090
Today you host this
banquet in Bailemen,

42:39.091 --> 42:44.132
Do you simply want to
invite us for a drink?

42:44.425 --> 42:47.257
Whether the attack
on Mr. Tang days ago,

42:47.508 --> 42:50.882
has some relations with

42:51.383 --> 42:52.549
the director general election?

42:52.883 --> 42:55.549
I think so.
Shanghai is not peaceful recently.

42:55.841 --> 42:56.757
Not peaceful at all.

42:57.050 --> 42:57.882
Ma San.

42:59.091 --> 43:02.549
You two,
are all getting old.

43:02.675 --> 43:03.882
You are seeking living.

43:04.425 --> 43:08.049
You help Mr. Tang
to say something like this.

43:09.091 --> 43:10.174
I don't feel strange.

43:11.675 --> 43:15.215
Mr. Tang, allow me to speak the truth.

43:16.216 --> 43:19.174
You gather us here,

43:20.508 --> 43:24.965
in order to find out
who attacked you.

43:25.341 --> 43:26.882
You want to warn us.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.632
In your eyes, there is only one tiger.

43:31.341 --> 43:32.840
That's me, Ye Qishan.

43:33.800 --> 43:37.382
Then I'm a sheep meets a tiger.

43:38.300 --> 43:39.590
You are a real tiger.

43:40.508 --> 43:41.674
I'm a real tiger, too.

43:42.883 --> 43:43.840
But,

43:44.383 --> 43:47.715
in Shanghai bund, there
could be only one tiger.

43:48.175 --> 43:50.340
I don't see any tiger.

43:52.133 --> 43:54.382
I see a lot of salted fish.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.090
Mr. Tang, be cautious.

43:58.216 --> 44:01.674
Salted fish can reverse.

44:04.758 --> 44:08.924
When it reverses,
this pot of soup is boiled.

44:11.300 --> 44:13.049
What are you doing?

44:14.258 --> 44:15.715
We are coming out for play.

44:16.091 --> 44:18.507
Harmony brings wealth.

44:23.550 --> 44:26.299
Don't forget, French inventory
team are still here.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.854
Council general Owen,

44:28.855 --> 44:34.924
won't vote for Mr. Ye,
when his post is at risk.

44:40.658 --> 44:41.715
Mr. Tang,

44:42.716 --> 44:45.281
we found the assassinations

44:45.282 --> 44:52.318
including the one targeting you,

44:52.319 --> 45:03.799
have some relations with
an underground society.

45:04.216 --> 45:08.340
-Blue Shirts Society?
-Yes, Blue Shirts Society.

45:16.091 --> 45:21.299
Don't forget that after the
Japanese ambassador was stabbed,

45:21.633 --> 45:27.799
how you helped the Japanese kill
the progressive students.

45:28.758 --> 45:31.632
You were so cruel.

45:32.258 --> 45:35.427
Many of the students were
from the Blue Shirts Society.

45:35.428 --> 45:37.291
If I were you,

45:37.758 --> 45:44.590
I will be very, very, very careful.

46:35.883 --> 46:36.965
Ruoyun, you...

46:40.550 --> 46:41.757
How do you...

46:42.300 --> 46:43.174
What?

46:46.966 --> 46:48.757
I'm not dead.
Are you scared?

46:48.758 --> 46:49.757
You sing very well.

46:52.550 --> 46:53.299
Sing very well?

46:54.308 --> 46:56.299
I was in the chorus.

46:59.925 --> 47:01.090
Do you want to drink?

47:04.175 --> 47:05.299
This alcohol is very good.

47:07.508 --> 47:10.174
You can't imagine how expensive it is.

47:19.175 --> 47:20.174
Let's drink together.

47:22.133 --> 47:23.965
You don't want to drink with me?

47:25.466 --> 47:27.174
We've been apart for a long time.

47:28.008 --> 47:28.924
You must have many words to say.

47:30.841 --> 47:32.840
I want to listen to you.
Let's drink together.

47:32.841 --> 47:35.715
I come here to
give this back to you.

47:45.133 --> 47:48.965
Sorry, when I was in prison,
I broke it.

47:49.841 --> 47:51.424
I shouldn't let you join
the organization.

47:52.550 --> 47:55.632
I shouldn't ask you
to join the action.

48:12.758 --> 48:14.465
You said you shouldn't,

48:16.216 --> 48:17.840
shouldn't let me join in.

48:19.716 --> 48:22.757
No matter success or fail,
we would be together.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.965
This was what you said.

48:25.708 --> 48:28.661
We would do to Peking and get married.
This was also what you said!

48:29.550 --> 48:30.507
Sorry.

48:33.300 --> 48:35.215
Now there is only sorry.

48:35.883 --> 48:38.049
Sorry... Sorry!

48:38.050 --> 48:40.340
Don't be like that.
Calm down, calm down.

48:40.591 --> 48:44.465
-Sorry, sorry.
-It's all my fault.

48:47.199 --> 48:48.839
Sorry.

48:49.355 --> 48:52.472
Sorry.
Sorry.

49:04.633 --> 49:05.799
Zihao.

49:07.758 --> 49:09.257
Li Zihao.

49:14.550 --> 49:15.799
When we first met,

49:19.466 --> 49:21.757
youu entered my life,

49:23.883 --> 49:26.215
and became the whole
meaning of my life.

49:28.466 --> 49:31.424
But what can I do after you left me?

49:31.425 --> 49:34.049
What should I do?

49:37.966 --> 49:39.840
What do you want me to do?

49:40.675 --> 49:43.007
I thought you were dead.

49:44.966 --> 49:46.840
My heart also dead.

49:47.758 --> 49:49.507
But you come back.

49:50.466 --> 49:51.882
How do you want me to treat you?

49:51.883 --> 49:53.799
How can I face the whole situation?

49:55.258 --> 49:57.174
What should I do?

50:06.091 --> 50:09.507
Miss Lan, the next show is to begin.
Mr. Tang is waiting for you.

50:19.583 --> 50:20.590
I have to leave.

50:22.591 --> 50:23.590
Zihao.

50:50.675 --> 50:53.257
Miss Lan, it's your turn to perform.

50:54.175 --> 50:55.340
Mr. Tang is waiting for you.

51:07.466 --> 51:09.257
<i>See, see, see</i>

51:09.883 --> 51:12.340
<i>Skirts waves in lights</i>

51:12.341 --> 51:14.257
<i>What I miss</i>

51:14.258 --> 51:16.674
<i>Is you</i>

51:16.675 --> 51:18.299
<i>See, see, see</i>

51:18.991 --> 51:22.424
<i>Red lips</i>

51:22.425 --> 51:25.799
<i>Only dreams left</i>

51:48.758 --> 51:49.924
Why do you ask her to do this?

51:52.508 --> 51:54.132
-Calm down?
-Why?

51:58.466 --> 52:01.049
I know you will meet.

52:05.466 --> 52:06.632
Isn't it dangerous?

52:11.758 --> 52:13.090
After that action,

52:14.716 --> 52:16.257
her situation was not good.

52:17.425 --> 52:18.090
Take it easy.

52:19.008 --> 52:23.590
Her current task,
is to stay with Tang Hexuan.

52:25.841 --> 52:26.840
But,

52:28.925 --> 52:32.382
It seems that she really falls
in love with the old man.

52:35.091 --> 52:38.715
Yes, you still hold her document.

52:41.883 --> 52:43.007
We don't have other choice.

52:43.341 --> 52:45.299
As for her current situation,

52:45.800 --> 52:49.090
I'm afraid she might do
something bad for you.

52:53.591 --> 52:55.090
You mean, something bad
for the organization?

52:55.591 --> 52:59.299
If there is no organization,
can you live like this?

52:59.758 --> 53:03.840
Do you think the organization knows
nothing about your prison break?

53:04.091 --> 53:07.340
Why don't you let Lan Ruoyun free?

53:07.466 --> 53:08.590
She has done so much.

53:09.175 --> 53:12.174
I do so to ensure more people's safety.

53:15.050 --> 53:18.465
Why don't you contact with
organization after prison break?

53:19.216 --> 53:21.882
Tang Hexuan takes me every day.

53:23.591 --> 53:24.549
Tang.

53:29.591 --> 53:33.674
Ok, just seize the opportunity.

53:34.216 --> 53:37.049
It's a rare opportunity.

53:44.506 --> 53:45.911
Ok.

53:47.966 --> 53:49.965
-But I have a request.
-Say it.

53:50.258 --> 53:51.549
After things done,

53:51.758 --> 53:54.757
destroy Lan Ruoyun's document,
and let her go.

54:59.175 --> 54:59.965
Miss Tang.

55:00.925 --> 55:03.840
You father said he is busy,
so he asked Zihao to pick me up.

55:04.175 --> 55:05.632
Only pick you up?

55:07.050 --> 55:08.257
Zihao.

55:08.883 --> 55:09.757
I forgot,

55:10.383 --> 55:13.257
I heard you and him,
were good friends before.

55:14.383 --> 55:17.963
-Zihao and me are not good friends.
-If you are not good friends,

55:18.652 --> 55:20.382
why do you call his
name so intimate?

55:22.550 --> 55:24.132
Yesterday I saw you and Owen

55:24.300 --> 55:25.882
walked out of the
Huamao Hotel together.

55:26.633 --> 55:27.799
You were so close.

55:32.341 --> 55:35.257
-Do you think I betray your father?
-No, I didn't tell him.

55:36.508 --> 55:38.160
But I want to tell you.

55:39.247 --> 55:42.641
You'd better stay away with Li Zihao.

55:49.041 --> 55:51.132
Your father knew that I met Owen.

55:51.383 --> 55:54.257
Your father asked me to find him,
and discuss something.

55:54.883 --> 55:56.424
So you don't have to worry about it.

55:56.925 --> 55:59.219
You don't have to tell
me these in the future.

56:01.216 --> 56:04.090
The only thing you have to remember
is that your father loves you.

56:04.866 --> 56:06.258
Do you love him?

56:09.675 --> 56:12.840
Qianqian, you should
stay away from me,

56:12.841 --> 56:14.994
and stay away from here, ok?

56:15.300 --> 56:18.174
You shouldn't stay in Shanghai,
you should back to Britain immediately.

56:47.833 --> 56:49.340
This lady falls love with you.

56:51.591 --> 56:52.340
Nonsense.

56:52.883 --> 56:55.174
Just an eye contact is enough, I know.

57:01.425 --> 57:03.465
Don't treat her like
what you did to me.

57:16.841 --> 57:19.090
Our god.

57:21.050 --> 57:23.924
Wish people all call you saint.

57:26.216 --> 57:27.632
Wish your country comes.

57:29.050 --> 57:32.507
Wish your will being carried out.

57:56.758 --> 57:57.424
Zihao.

57:59.966 --> 58:01.882
What kind of person is my father?

58:06.133 --> 58:06.799
It's not important.

58:08.258 --> 58:09.174
The only thing you have to know,

58:09.925 --> 58:13.549
is that he is your father,
he loves you, that's enough.

58:16.925 --> 58:20.507
Maybe this kind of love is unfortunate.

58:24.633 --> 58:26.757
Maybe it's unfortunate.

58:28.883 --> 58:31.549
But maybe it's a fortune.

58:45.591 --> 58:48.632
Li Zihao, I love you.

58:49.258 --> 58:51.965
No matter who you are, I love you!

58:52.966 --> 58:53.882
Let me say that again,

58:54.633 --> 58:58.424
no matter who you are, I love you!

59:31.466 --> 59:33.465
You can touch all women
in Shanghai bund,

59:36.508 --> 59:37.674
except for her.

59:48.383 --> 59:49.215
Please.

59:49.591 --> 59:54.340
As Mr. Tang wants to
cooperate with us sincerely.

59:54.550 --> 59:58.590
You don't have to worry about
the director general election.

01:00:13.383 --> 01:00:24.382
But I don't want anything
bad to Japan happens.

01:00:57.216 --> 01:00:59.049
Ask Zhao Yan to bring some sandalwood,

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.632
to disperse the smell of Japanese.

01:01:03.216 --> 01:01:03.924
Yes.

01:01:17.175 --> 01:01:18.007
Why are you here?

01:01:20.008 --> 01:01:21.340
I want to drink with you.

01:01:23.508 --> 01:01:24.340
It's too late.

01:01:29.591 --> 01:01:31.090
Do you want to drink with me?

01:01:31.216 --> 01:01:33.430
-I'm good at drinking.
-No.

01:01:33.431 --> 01:01:34.905
You are so boring.

01:02:01.966 --> 01:02:04.965
Qianqian, it's too late,
you should go back home.

01:02:07.316 --> 01:02:09.044
Do you dance with me?

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:18.924
Can you dance?

01:02:24.425 --> 01:02:27.220
I can teach you.

01:02:29.466 --> 01:02:30.299
Relax.

01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:37.965
Sorry.

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:49.382
Qianqian, if you are so naughty
I will carry you back.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:55.392
You mean, you don't want to dance?

01:02:56.633 --> 01:02:58.222
Then you want a wrestling?

01:03:49.341 --> 01:03:50.549
Why are you nodding your head?

01:03:58.216 --> 01:04:00.215
Do you think I'm weak?

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:09.299
Each of me and Ye Qishan
only has 50% chance to win.

01:04:10.091 --> 01:04:13.757
This time, I want to take
advantage of Ye Qishan.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:18.840
Let all people in Shanghai bund,

01:04:21.008 --> 01:04:22.549
witness me being killed.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.299
Then all people will support us.

01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:30.924
I heard Ye Qishan has recruited
several killers.

01:04:31.758 --> 01:04:32.924
They never failed.

01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:36.882
Father, is it worth?

01:04:38.633 --> 01:04:43.590
We are going to expose our
weakest point to our enemies.

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:48.049
Only when a person is the weakest,
those hidden enemies around him

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:53.257
could emerge.

01:04:57.216 --> 01:05:01.049
This war, I'd rather die, than lose.

01:05:15.258 --> 01:05:17.715
My Lord, Mr. Takada is asking for you.

01:05:31.675 --> 01:05:35.424
I'm not intend to disturb
Mr Tang's thinking of speech

01:05:35.675 --> 01:05:38.340
at this moment.

01:05:42.425 --> 01:05:47.382
I come here to give you a present.

01:06:21.466 --> 01:06:25.632
I rarely deliver a speech
at such an occasion.

01:06:28.258 --> 01:06:34.965
Today is the 85th anniversary of the
opening of Shanghai French Concession.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:39.132
I want to tell everyone,

01:06:41.008 --> 01:06:43.390
the director general election

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:48.180
is a very great thing

01:06:48.181 --> 01:06:50.757
to Chinese people.

01:06:50.758 --> 01:06:51.632
Father!

01:06:57.883 --> 01:06:58.840
Protect the Lord!

01:07:03.425 --> 01:07:04.049
Hurry!

01:07:11.716 --> 01:07:12.757
Protect the Lord!

01:07:13.425 --> 01:07:14.507
Protect the Lord!

01:07:44.841 --> 01:07:46.590
Leave! Hurry!

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:50.965
Hurry!

01:07:51.633 --> 01:07:52.549
Hurry!

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.299
A Hua Watch your back!

01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:55.382
Watch your back!

01:07:55.383 --> 01:07:57.424
Hurry, follow me!

01:07:59.383 --> 01:08:00.465
Protect the Lord!

01:08:01.633 --> 01:08:02.340
Go! Hurry!

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:03.174
Hurry!

01:08:03.841 --> 01:08:04.299
Hurry!

01:08:04.966 --> 01:08:05.590
Hurry! Go!

01:08:05.633 --> 01:08:06.257
Hurry!

01:08:07.091 --> 01:08:07.715
Go!

01:08:09.591 --> 01:08:10.090
Hurry!

01:08:44.216 --> 01:08:46.756
Father!

01:09:16.841 --> 01:09:17.965
Hurry! Go!

01:09:20.925 --> 01:09:22.299
What's the matter?

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:23.631
This way?

01:09:23.633 --> 01:09:25.506
What's the matter? Tell me!

01:09:25.883 --> 01:09:26.506
Hurry!

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:28.715
My father died.

01:09:29.508 --> 01:09:30.590
You arranged the cars.

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.006
You arranged the staff.

01:09:32.008 --> 01:09:33.006
Go!

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.006
It's you!

01:09:36.175 --> 01:09:40.049
-You want to be the boss?
-Fang Jie, calm down!

01:09:40.633 --> 01:09:42.090
How can I calm down?

01:09:42.383 --> 01:09:44.006
Why there was explosion?

01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:48.299
Go!

01:09:52.591 --> 01:09:53.549
Go!

01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:07.590
My father is dead.

01:10:10.091 --> 01:10:11.674
What should Qianqian do?

01:10:17.758 --> 01:10:20.882
I take the bullet for you.
I hope you deserve it.

01:10:22.675 --> 01:10:25.049
You treat brothers much
better than treat women.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.507
I regard Qianqian as my sister.

01:10:34.883 --> 01:10:38.757
You don't know how she loves you.

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:41.757
Sometimes I really admire you.

01:10:42.508 --> 01:10:44.674
Have you ever considered her future?

01:10:46.466 --> 01:10:47.965
Have you?

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.257
I really don't understand.

01:10:52.966 --> 01:10:55.757
The more dull you are,
women love you more. Why?

01:10:57.091 --> 01:10:58.049
Do you know?

01:10:59.883 --> 01:11:03.757
Women need love, need care.

01:11:03.758 --> 01:11:05.632
Do you know you are getting hurt?
You are bleeding.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.507
Then what?

01:11:13.508 --> 01:11:14.465
I don't want to drink.

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:18.038
-Have you concluded your conversation?
-Yes.

01:11:35.508 --> 01:11:36.299
Brother.

01:11:38.008 --> 01:11:39.382
I just don't want you to be like me.

01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:43.549
No place to live when alive,

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:50.632
and no place to be buried after died.

01:11:53.716 --> 01:12:00.924
<i>One sparrow one head,</i>

01:12:01.716 --> 01:12:07.799
<i>Two eyes go round and round.</i>

01:12:08.883 --> 01:12:16.715
<i>Two wings and two feet.</i>

01:14:36.133 --> 01:14:38.549
Old buddy, are you really dead?

01:14:39.216 --> 01:14:40.465
You are so foxy.

01:14:41.133 --> 01:14:42.549
I can't believe you.

01:14:43.383 --> 01:14:44.799
Even your death.

01:14:46.883 --> 01:14:50.507
Unless you open this coffin
and let me check.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.840
Old buddy...

01:15:07.591 --> 01:15:08.715
How miserable!

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.090
Who is so cruel,

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:14.257
not only shoot you,
but also blow up you.

01:15:15.591 --> 01:15:17.340
He was burnt like that.

01:15:17.341 --> 01:15:18.590
You shut up.

01:15:22.175 --> 01:15:25.757
Old buddy, without you,

01:15:26.675 --> 01:15:28.549
what will Shanghai bund like?

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:37.174
Qianqian, listen to
your uncle, marry soon.

01:15:39.216 --> 01:15:42.007
How about become my concubine?

01:15:43.175 --> 01:15:46.299
Old buddy, I miss you.

01:15:46.758 --> 01:15:47.840
You shut up!

01:15:47.883 --> 01:15:49.090
Knee down!

01:15:49.091 --> 01:15:49.549
Boss!

01:15:56.216 --> 01:15:56.799
Kowtow to him!

01:16:20.841 --> 01:16:24.799
Me, Ye Qishan killed many people.

01:16:25.925 --> 01:16:29.299
Only the dead could force me.

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.674
You two want to be heroes?

01:16:34.258 --> 01:16:37.174
Ok, I'll let you know.

01:16:37.966 --> 01:16:40.549
There is no hero in Shanghai bund.

01:16:41.508 --> 01:16:42.465
There is only bully.

01:16:45.341 --> 01:16:49.174
Me, Ye Qishan, is the
biggest bully in Shanghai bund.

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:54.007
Today, you win.

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.257
Old buddy, don't say
I'm not respect you.

01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:07.382
You are so great.

01:17:13.925 --> 01:17:15.174
Useless!

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.674
Sorry boss.

01:17:51.716 --> 01:17:54.757
Ye Qishan is obviously targeting us.

01:17:54.841 --> 01:17:56.132
Tomorrow is the
director general election.

01:17:58.216 --> 01:17:59.340
He intends to do so.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.715
We have to go to the
director general meeting.

01:18:02.216 --> 01:18:07.174
Otherwise, other gangs
will look down on us.

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:13.674
But if we go there,
Ye Qishan will definitely provoke us.

01:18:14.133 --> 01:18:16.632
So we have to go.

01:18:17.966 --> 01:18:19.882
But the person should be Hao.

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:25.840
Young Lord! Young Lord!

01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:29.049
The lady was kidnapped.

01:18:29.258 --> 01:18:31.882
Our two bases
were also destroyed by Ye Qishan.

01:18:35.216 --> 01:18:37.007
Why we are still holding the meeting?

01:18:37.508 --> 01:18:38.674
Dudes, follow me!

01:18:39.633 --> 01:18:40.424
Calm down.

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:42.049
You only know calm down!

01:18:42.466 --> 01:18:44.340
How can Qianqian fall in love with you?

01:18:48.175 --> 01:18:49.257
Calm down.

01:18:50.633 --> 01:18:51.424
Calm down?

01:18:51.925 --> 01:18:52.965
How about Qianqian?

01:18:53.716 --> 01:18:54.965
Watch her die?

01:18:58.758 --> 01:19:01.674
Before Ye Qishan is elected,
Qianqian will be safe.

01:19:02.341 --> 01:19:04.840
If there is any action,
we will be fooled.

01:19:07.091 --> 01:19:08.965
There is only fear in your eyes.

01:19:09.508 --> 01:19:11.424
Fear could help us keep calm.

01:19:12.133 --> 01:19:14.215
He is forcing you take action,
in order to catch us all.

01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:18.215
Once we take action,
all the gangs will support him.

01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:20.174
I'm asking you,
how about Qianqian?

01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:24.174
Don't fight, don't fight!

01:19:24.466 --> 01:19:26.882
Jie, don't fight!

01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:28.882
Listen to me.

01:19:28.883 --> 01:19:32.882
Mr. Tang treated me well,
my staff is your staff.

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:38.882
If Ye Qishan wants to take action,
we will meet plot with plot.

01:19:52.966 --> 01:19:56.674
Brother, do you think
Ma San is reliable?

01:19:57.675 --> 01:19:58.632
How about you?

01:20:02.341 --> 01:20:06.174
What's the feeling of death?

01:20:07.425 --> 01:20:10.174
Before I die, can you
help me write a testament?

01:20:11.508 --> 01:20:12.090
Say it.

01:20:12.466 --> 01:20:15.632
Tang Qianqian is mine.
Last words written by Fang Jie.

01:20:17.216 --> 01:20:18.132
Stupid!

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:22.215
Tomorrow we should play to the score.

01:20:22.508 --> 01:20:24.507
Leave immediately
after fulfilling the task.

01:20:25.889 --> 01:20:26.949
Ok.

01:20:29.883 --> 01:20:34.590
Tomorrow, it will be you save me?

01:20:34.758 --> 01:20:35.882
Or I save you?

01:20:41.466 --> 01:20:45.174
Brother, do you have any wish?

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:49.299
What's your future plan?

01:20:54.341 --> 01:20:55.799
I once had a dream.

01:20:56.341 --> 01:20:58.882
I dreamed that the whole Shanghai
bund belongs to me.

01:20:59.758 --> 01:21:04.007
Qianqian holds my hand.

01:21:12.925 --> 01:21:14.882
If there is a dying wish.

01:21:20.466 --> 01:21:21.799
That is, if I die,

01:21:23.591 --> 01:21:24.715
I hope you can be alive.

01:21:43.216 --> 01:21:46.132
Hao, I pick you up.

01:21:47.425 --> 01:21:49.590
We can talk on the road.

01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:24.549
Baked roll, baked roll!

01:22:26.716 --> 01:22:28.674
Come and buy!

01:22:33.716 --> 01:22:36.965
Mr. San, we go round in circles,

01:22:37.925 --> 01:22:39.132
will we be late?

01:22:40.508 --> 01:22:41.382
Have one.

01:23:25.216 --> 01:23:26.299
Buddy.

01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:28.299
After Mr. Tang died,

01:23:29.008 --> 01:23:32.257
Ye Qishan is of course
the big boss of Shanghai bund.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.465
He cooperate with Owen.
You can't deal with them.

01:23:39.008 --> 01:23:44.549
You are well educated,
but you are too young.

01:23:45.591 --> 01:23:48.049
You don't know, people like
me, are just like shrimp,

01:23:48.925 --> 01:23:53.174
when face storm, we only
swing toward the big wave.

01:23:53.586 --> 01:23:55.111
Can you understand?

01:23:56.758 --> 01:23:59.215
Get off, buddy.

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.344
-Biao.
-Please welcome French Consul General,

01:24:43.067 --> 01:24:43.232
-Mr. Owen.
-Boss?

01:24:43.233 --> 01:24:44.979
Does anyone from
Tang's house come?

01:24:45.014 --> 01:24:47.458
Not yet.
Mr. Ma San is dealing with it.

01:24:49.466 --> 01:24:52.382
How come you...

01:24:52.383 --> 01:24:53.507
Shut up!

01:24:55.008 --> 01:24:57.882
I don't want to be late
for the banquet.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.799
Mr. San, sorry.

01:25:03.175 --> 01:25:04.799
We have to feed our family.

01:25:07.258 --> 01:25:09.799
I'm very honored to introduce you

01:25:12.633 --> 01:25:18.132
the dominating figure of this banquet.

01:25:18.133 --> 01:25:19.340
Why haven't Ma San come yet?

01:25:27.508 --> 01:25:32.924
Please invite the newly-elected
director general.

01:25:32.925 --> 01:25:33.340
Mr. YeQishan.

01:26:28.425 --> 01:26:30.590
Thank you, thank you.
Everybody please sit down.

01:26:32.675 --> 01:26:33.965
Thank you.

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.549
Thank you for supporting me.

01:26:38.716 --> 01:26:41.424
As long as me, Ye Qishan has food,

01:26:42.175 --> 01:26:43.799
you can have food, too.

01:26:44.008 --> 01:26:48.590
Now we will award to the newly-elected
director general, Mr. Ye Qishan.

01:27:07.425 --> 01:27:08.465
Hruyy, go!

01:27:14.425 --> 01:27:16.382
Say, where is Qianqian?

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.257
Buddy, if you kill me,
you won't leave here.

01:27:22.425 --> 01:27:24.049
I'm asking you, where is Qianqian?

01:27:24.841 --> 01:27:25.632
Upstairs.

01:27:30.383 --> 01:27:31.757
Hurry, save the boss!

01:27:31.758 --> 01:27:33.090
Hurry, hurry!

01:27:49.341 --> 01:27:50.132
Stop!

01:27:52.966 --> 01:27:53.840
Stop!

01:27:56.508 --> 01:27:57.299
There he is!

01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:25.424
Rubbish!

01:28:51.633 --> 01:28:52.382
Get up!

01:28:58.758 --> 01:28:59.465
Step back!

01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:03.007
Back!

01:29:04.925 --> 01:29:06.590
Back, back, back, back.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.465
Boss.

01:29:15.925 --> 01:29:17.049
Don't shoot!

01:29:20.841 --> 01:29:22.257
Don't let him go. Run!

01:29:25.133 --> 01:29:27.632
Don't waste your time.
You cannot escape.

01:29:27.633 --> 01:29:29.090
Break the door, hurry!

01:29:29.091 --> 01:29:31.715
Shut up.
Wanna to sit on wheelchair?

01:30:25.341 --> 01:30:26.132
Boss.

01:30:28.675 --> 01:30:29.424
Shoot!

01:30:39.591 --> 01:30:40.382
Boss.

01:30:42.216 --> 01:30:43.340
That way!

01:31:51.508 --> 01:31:52.299
Go away.

01:31:53.883 --> 01:31:54.590
Beat you to death.

01:32:00.133 --> 01:32:00.757
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:32:01.425 --> 01:32:02.174
Run fast.

01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:08.924
Rush!

01:32:23.633 --> 01:32:24.507
You have no bullet!

01:32:26.216 --> 01:32:27.386
I'll kill you.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.674
Hurry!

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.049
You come so late.

01:32:50.841 --> 01:32:51.549
Get up.

01:33:15.216 --> 01:33:16.007
Kill me.

01:33:16.008 --> 01:33:18.882
You two bastard.
Don't want to leave here alive.

01:33:19.008 --> 01:33:20.840
Especially you, Fang Jie.

01:33:21.216 --> 01:33:23.007
You bastard, wretch.

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:27.257
I don't like others curse my brother.

01:33:33.091 --> 01:33:34.257
Let me go!

01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:40.715
Let me go!

01:33:45.508 --> 01:33:46.674
Let me go!

01:34:13.758 --> 01:34:15.382
Look, why is there an explosion?

01:34:15.925 --> 01:34:17.507
What happened?

01:34:18.216 --> 01:34:18.924
I don't know.

01:34:31.633 --> 01:34:32.799
Fu Sheng.

01:34:32.966 --> 01:34:33.715
Yes.

01:34:34.883 --> 01:34:36.799
It's our time to clean up.

01:34:37.091 --> 01:34:39.007
My Lord, you are the wisest!

01:34:54.841 --> 01:34:57.674
Brother, it's too late, why
Fu Sheng ask us to go there?

01:35:28.716 --> 01:35:31.049
Father, you are still...

01:35:35.216 --> 01:35:37.590
You endured hardship.

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:41.424
This time it's so risky.
Father, it's really a big joke.

01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:45.757
What? Are you afraid?

01:35:51.591 --> 01:35:53.424
This is your old classmate?

01:36:18.008 --> 01:36:19.340
Just because me and her...?

01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:22.215
How can I care about this?

01:36:29.591 --> 01:36:32.215
Three years ago, she attended
students' assassination organization.

01:36:33.633 --> 01:36:37.257
She killed Chen Zuguang,
Miao Xin and Wulan Nade.

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.549
She got injured in the
action of killing Qiao Yishan.

01:36:41.383 --> 01:36:43.215
Since then,
she has concealed her identity.

01:36:43.758 --> 01:36:46.674
Then she performs in
Shanghai's Grand World.

01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:51.007
Hao, do you know these?

01:37:00.466 --> 01:37:02.382
I have been with Ruoyun so many years.

01:37:03.133 --> 01:37:04.882
I don't know these.

01:37:06.425 --> 01:37:09.507
But, Hao,

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:12.340
you are childhood friends.

01:37:13.591 --> 01:37:15.215
She comes to kill me.

01:37:17.716 --> 01:37:19.757
Do you know?

01:37:34.175 --> 01:37:35.090
Don't know.

01:37:35.925 --> 01:37:37.632
You don't know?

01:37:39.633 --> 01:37:42.465
No matter how we beat her,
she doesn't say any word.

01:37:43.091 --> 01:37:45.424
Are there any other
dangerous persons around me?

01:37:49.591 --> 01:37:54.340
But, even if she doesn't say it,
Takada Silurian has given this to us.

01:37:56.383 --> 01:38:00.340
I've spent a lot of money
to get this from him.

01:38:01.716 --> 01:38:06.090
But we'd better reconfirm.

01:38:09.966 --> 01:38:13.340
Otherwise, if it reveals,

01:38:13.883 --> 01:38:16.132
people will laugh at Qing Gang.

01:38:20.508 --> 01:38:21.674
That all.

01:38:22.841 --> 01:38:25.424
But I know, it's not the whole.

01:38:36.633 --> 01:38:43.549
Ruoyun, do you really
hope that guy kills me?

01:38:45.425 --> 01:38:46.840
You hate me so much?

01:39:05.175 --> 01:39:07.924
Your childhood friend belongs to you.

01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:10.007
You deal with her.

01:40:28.633 --> 01:40:32.882
Live well.

01:41:52.091 --> 01:41:53.632
<i>I obey you.</i>

01:41:53.633 --> 01:41:55.840
<i>No matter where you want to go,
we just go there.</i>

01:41:56.966 --> 01:41:58.257
<i>I want to go to Shanghai.</i>

01:41:58.675 --> 01:42:01.049
<i>And, I want to go abroad.</i>

01:42:01.312 --> 01:42:02.904
<i>Ok.</i>

01:42:05.425 --> 01:42:11.882
<i>I turn around</i>

01:42:12.633 --> 01:42:15.757
<i>Who says farewell</i>

01:42:16.675 --> 01:42:19.840
<i>Is always sad</i>

01:42:21.133 --> 01:42:28.840
<i>Close your eyes, it's still us.</i>

01:42:30.008 --> 01:42:39.424
<i>Close your eyes, it's still us.</i>

01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:13.882
Is this your base?

01:43:17.216 --> 01:43:21.507
You are just like mice
that exist everywhere.

01:43:22.383 --> 01:43:23.965
What you say are
all about revolution.

01:43:24.466 --> 01:43:26.507
But you don't do it wisely.

01:43:27.508 --> 01:43:30.174
The best way to treat
people like mice,

01:43:31.341 --> 01:43:33.382
is to kill you all.

01:43:34.258 --> 01:43:38.840
So I am the last one to be killed.

01:43:40.425 --> 01:43:43.049
I don't believe in those with nothing.

01:43:44.925 --> 01:43:47.382
Of course, you have this.

01:44:03.675 --> 01:44:07.924
So many of you have died, all of
you are not worth 80 gold bars.

01:44:14.258 --> 01:44:15.340
Kill him.

01:44:21.383 --> 01:44:25.882
Jie, this is a society that
big fish eats the small ones.

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:27.882
The weak one's destiny is dead.

01:44:29.675 --> 01:44:33.007
Between gangs,
there is never brotherhood.

01:44:33.258 --> 01:44:34.799
What unchanged is benefit.

01:44:36.008 --> 01:44:40.465
If you want to be the boss,
the only way is to conquer.

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:14.132
You said we share weal and woe.

01:45:17.216 --> 01:45:19.965
I call you Brother Hao, because
I really regard you as my brother.

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:26.757
Since I was young,
I fight with others.

01:45:31.675 --> 01:45:34.257
In orphanage, I fight with
other orphans for food.

01:45:35.508 --> 01:45:38.840
At port, I fight with workers
for a place to sleep.

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:40.799
In Shanghai bund, I fight for living.

01:45:42.966 --> 01:45:44.382
Since I met my father,

01:45:45.425 --> 01:45:47.590
I fight for more places with my staff.

01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:52.590
Whatever I want to own, nobody
dares to snatch it from my hand.

01:45:55.425 --> 01:45:57.465
But you are my brother.

01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:03.174
I can give Qianqian to you,

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:08.132
I can also give up the
top position in Shanghai bund.

01:46:11.425 --> 01:46:13.132
But why did you lie to me?

01:46:15.133 --> 01:46:16.215
Why?

01:46:16.883 --> 01:46:19.465
Why do you work for
the Blue Shirts Society?

01:46:19.466 --> 01:46:19.924
Why?

01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:33.090
Fang Jie, my good brother.

01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:38.507
Live well, just for me.

01:46:44.841 --> 01:46:47.299
I don't want to see you again.

01:47:21.633 --> 01:47:22.965
Fu Sheng.

01:47:24.591 --> 01:47:29.965
Do you know a man named Luo?

01:47:52.591 --> 01:47:55.090
It's him! Hurry!

01:48:14.883 --> 01:48:17.757
Mr. Tang said, Fu Sheng
loves drinking tea.

01:48:18.341 --> 01:48:19.465
Don't waste.

01:50:12.216 --> 01:50:16.215
We search in and around
Suzhou River for three times.

01:50:17.175 --> 01:50:18.840
But still haven't found
Li Zihao's dead body.

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.299
You didn't kill him.
He will come and kill me.

01:50:25.425 --> 01:50:27.382
You want me to die?

01:50:30.591 --> 01:50:33.924
The one who killed the boss,
won't be the boss.

01:50:36.383 --> 01:50:37.965
But let me tell you.

01:50:39.008 --> 01:50:43.757
The only person in Shanghai bund
that could replace me, is myself.

01:50:45.050 --> 01:50:47.965
Others have all died.

01:50:49.883 --> 01:50:51.257
Do you want to replace me?

01:50:51.591 --> 01:50:55.674
Qianqian will definitely marry you.
This gang will soon or late be yours.

01:50:57.883 --> 01:51:03.424
This trick, you failed.

01:51:06.258 --> 01:51:07.090
Father.

01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:13.757
I'm too stupid to make
such a big trick.

01:51:15.966 --> 01:51:17.924
The fortune teller said
I'm fortunate enough.

01:51:19.258 --> 01:51:23.965
That means, the achievement
of a general cost many lives.

01:51:26.716 --> 01:51:28.757
But I still need an heir.

01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:34.340
I respect you, but you give up.

01:51:34.675 --> 01:51:36.924
You want to be the bones under my feet.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.799
In this worid,

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.007
the most horrible thing is
those who pretend to be foolish.

01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:53.257
What's more horrible, is fool.

01:52:22.008 --> 01:52:23.882
You are not the one that I can trust.

01:52:24.675 --> 01:52:30.382
Why you youngsters all follow
the Blue Shirts Society,

01:52:32.466 --> 01:52:34.757
and sacrifice your youth.

01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:42.340
Those who accompany me
for dinner are less and less.

01:52:42.341 --> 01:52:44.590
I can only trust my wn family members.

01:52:45.716 --> 01:52:46.382
Eat.

01:52:53.008 --> 01:52:54.132
If you do good things,
bad guys will not happy.

01:52:56.050 --> 01:52:57.424
Wtyy to be a good person?

01:52:57.883 --> 01:53:00.543
Nice people are always being bullied.
In the current society,

01:53:01.383 --> 01:53:05.799
you don't screw others over,
they will screw you over in turns.

01:53:06.925 --> 01:53:07.757
Father,

01:53:11.175 --> 01:53:13.090
In Shangai bund, there is only
traditional code of conduct.

01:53:16.466 --> 01:53:18.090
There is no good or bad.

01:53:57.508 --> 01:53:59.340
He lied to me.

01:54:00.008 --> 01:54:01.132
He killed Jie,

01:54:02.425 --> 01:54:03.549
killed many students,

01:54:06.216 --> 01:54:07.424
killed many people.

01:54:08.966 --> 01:54:11.715
He will combines all gangs
in Shanghai bund, to kill you.

01:54:12.341 --> 01:54:15.174
He takes advantage of me,
from the very beginning,

01:54:16.591 --> 01:54:19.257
to kill his enemies,
destroy the Blue Shirts Society.

01:54:20.091 --> 01:54:21.340
What my father owes you,

01:54:25.466 --> 01:54:27.090
I will pay you back with my whole life.

01:54:29.175 --> 01:54:32.090
Qianqian, you don't
owe anyone anything.

01:54:37.216 --> 01:54:41.007
He should pay back by his own.

01:54:52.383 --> 01:54:56.549
Qianqian, you should leave
Shanghai bund as soon as possible.

01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:03.132
No, we should leave together.

01:55:07.466 --> 01:55:10.840
