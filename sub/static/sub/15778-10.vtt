00:01.819 --> 00:05.156
Joe, l'm gonna need
three copies of this.

00:05.157 --> 00:07.725
- You want me to go out there and do that?
- Check out this site.

00:07.726 --> 00:10.226
Go ahead.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.220
Where is he?!

00:36.221 --> 00:39.588
- Where is Venture?
- Venture?

00:39.625 --> 00:42.393
Dude, no, stop!
There's been a mistake!

00:42.394 --> 00:43.561
What now?

00:43.562 --> 00:47.665
This isn't the secret Venture compound.
lt's your accountant's office.

00:47.666 --> 00:51.102
What? Are you kidding?
That was, like, my best entrance ever!

00:51.103 --> 00:52.136
lt was excellent.

00:52.137 --> 00:54.071
- Very impressive.
- This sucks!

00:54.072 --> 00:58.442
Wrong address. Wrong address.
Everybody back in the cocoon.

00:58.443 --> 01:00.244
- Should we...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00.245 --> 01:03.147
Take the pens and the Post-its
and some, copy paper.

01:03.148 --> 01:06.217
You always need copy paper.
And get that security tape!

01:06.218 --> 01:08.820
l want a Quicktime
of my minty-fresh entrance...

01:08.821 --> 01:12.018
posted on my homepage by tomorrow!

01:32.811 --> 01:34.445
Who's a pretty pussy cat?

01:34.446 --> 01:36.514
Who's a pretty,
pretty pussy cat?

01:36.515 --> 01:38.950
Yes. You are.

01:38.951 --> 01:41.219
No, no! Just calm... Don't!

01:41.220 --> 01:43.720
OK, fine, go!
Just go!

01:44.556 --> 01:48.822
Mr. Venture, you're back.
How was Japan?

01:48.861 --> 01:51.395
Fan-freaking-tastic.
How'd you know?

01:51.396 --> 01:53.664
- Call it a hunch.
- ls that what you call it?

01:53.665 --> 01:56.767
No. l call it an Oni.
Actually, a Japanese demon.

01:56.768 --> 01:59.337
So you can see it. Thank you!

01:59.338 --> 02:02.039
Brock said it was the diet pills.
Can you get rid of it?

02:02.040 --> 02:05.271
Yes, yes.
l have just the stuff!

02:05.310 --> 02:08.346
These Oni are usually after
some form of retribution.

02:08.347 --> 02:12.683
So what did you do?
Violate a sacred temple? No. Let me guess.

02:12.684 --> 02:16.053
You relieved yourself
in someone's zen garden.

02:16.054 --> 02:17.388
Here we are!

02:17.389 --> 02:21.917
One demon extraction
coming right up!

02:21.960 --> 02:24.161
What the hell?

02:24.162 --> 02:26.797
- Wily one, this demon of yours.
- Damn it!

02:26.798 --> 02:29.700
Perhaps we should have snuck up on it.

02:29.701 --> 02:33.871
Nice. lt was perfectly content
to just tag along until you pissed it off.

02:33.872 --> 02:36.741
Surprise! You don't know
what the hell you're doing.

02:36.742 --> 02:38.910
The Tempest Tongs
should have worked.

02:38.911 --> 02:41.579
l must consult a higher power!

02:41.580 --> 02:44.181
Wait here while l go
to my daughter's closet.

02:44.182 --> 02:48.319
OK. l've reviewed the video
of the attack on Venture.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.088
What happened?
Why did we suck?

02:51.089 --> 02:53.424
How can we not suck
in the future?

02:53.425 --> 02:59.261
One answer pops up every time.
Weaponry. 21?

02:59.298 --> 03:02.400
Gentlemen,
l give you the Peda-Blade!

03:02.401 --> 03:05.536
Two razor-sharp blades
menacingly attached to...

03:05.537 --> 03:07.104
not the end of a skinny arm...

03:07.105 --> 03:09.273
but the end of a long, fat leg...

03:09.274 --> 03:12.243
giving us both
the reach and the edge...

03:12.244 --> 03:14.872
or should l say two edges?

03:15.948 --> 03:18.349
But we raided
the wrong address!

03:18.350 --> 03:21.752
We need real planning, not...
What? Figure skates?

03:21.753 --> 03:25.356
Look. l am trying. This is really tough.
l know l'm not Dr. Girl--

03:25.357 --> 03:30.056
- Do not say her name!
- Forgive me...

03:30.095 --> 03:33.431
but zee problem is one of planning,
not one of armament.

03:33.432 --> 03:36.701
Mr. Zee Monarch
already has a dazzling armory.

03:36.702 --> 03:38.502
What he needs is a strategist.

03:38.503 --> 03:42.940
A man of his prestige cannot simply
go after an enemy all villy-nilly.

03:42.941 --> 03:45.176
He can't give an enema
to free Willy? What?

03:45.177 --> 03:47.945
Shut up, 21. You might learn
something from this guy.

03:47.946 --> 03:50.081
What you need
is a second in command...

03:50.082 --> 03:53.284
who understands the intricacies
of organized villainy.

03:53.285 --> 03:57.288
- Zis l could offer you.
- Perfect! You're hired, Number...?

03:57.289 --> 04:00.850
Number Killinger,
Dr. Henry Killinger.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.160
And this is my Magic Murder Bag.

04:03.161 --> 04:06.430
Come on, Deano! You are, like,
the worst wheelman ever.

04:06.431 --> 04:09.834
We're actually moving slower
than when you were parallel-parking.

04:09.835 --> 04:13.104
Gun it! Look for some jumps!
Try to get her up on two wheels!

04:13.105 --> 04:15.840
Get something cool going, will you?

04:15.841 --> 04:17.774
Don't distract the driver.

04:17.776 --> 04:21.278
- Ten and two, ten and two.
- Hey. What's that up ahead?

04:21.279 --> 04:24.448
l didn't know we got that much traffic
inside the compound.

04:24.449 --> 04:28.352
l get it. l'll bet Brock set this up,
you know, to test us.

04:28.353 --> 04:30.755
OK, Mr. Handbook,
so what do we do?

04:30.756 --> 04:32.790
We should pull over
to the shoulder.

04:32.791 --> 04:36.360
l'll set up the road flares
and try to flag down a state trooper.

04:36.361 --> 04:40.751
You see if anyone's been injured.
Wait! K-turn.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.902
Hank!
Roll, Hank!

04:44.903 --> 04:47.838
Tuck and roll!
Protect your limbs!

04:47.839 --> 04:50.339
Will you come on?

04:50.809 --> 04:54.575
Holy smokes!
Hey, lady. Are you OK?

04:54.613 --> 04:57.548
Don't move her!
You're not supposed to...

04:57.549 --> 05:00.049
See?

05:00.218 --> 05:01.952
Master?!

05:01.953 --> 05:06.223
Master, are you here?
l have need of your counsel.

05:06.224 --> 05:10.327
Orpheus, you'll love this. Check me out.
l'm Catherine the Great's horse...

05:10.328 --> 05:13.564
to teach you a lesson
about biting off more than you can chew.

05:13.565 --> 05:17.802
My partially lovely assistant, Miss
Manyface, will play the part of Catherine.

05:17.803 --> 05:19.770
- Hi.
- Enough with the chatter.

05:19.771 --> 05:22.273
Get under there. Don't wince!

05:22.274 --> 05:26.210
Master, far be it from me to question
the relevance of your symbolism...

05:26.211 --> 05:32.191
but l'm fairly certain the whole horse
thing was an urban legend.

05:32.317 --> 05:34.351
What do you think?
Pretty sweet, huh?

05:34.352 --> 05:37.655
- This floor totally lights up.
- lf you don't mind me saying...

05:37.656 --> 05:41.592
you seem to be a tad overstaffed in
your control room. You could reassign...

05:41.593 --> 05:44.061
Say no more!
You're right again, #2.

05:44.062 --> 05:47.395
Him and...the dead guy next to him.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.837
This place is all creepy since that mumbly
guy just magically showed up.

05:52.838 --> 05:55.239
Totally!
And those new Black Guard dicks...

05:55.240 --> 05:57.475
took the Tekken 3 game
out of the lounge!

05:57.476 --> 05:59.477
Those guys are wicked spooky.

05:59.478 --> 06:02.413
How unfair is it
that they get the cool uniforms?

06:02.414 --> 06:06.250
- l'm still wearing an orange jerkin.
- Jerkin...

06:06.251 --> 06:09.687
One of you little chatter bugs
want to pop open the Venture files?

06:09.688 --> 06:11.922
Killinger needs
to be brought up to speed.

06:11.923 --> 06:15.192
- Yeah. Those files are classified.
- By whom?

06:15.193 --> 06:16.927
By you.

06:16.928 --> 06:20.164
OK. Great.
Well, now they're unclassified.

06:20.165 --> 06:22.998
Boys!
Where the hell...?

06:23.034 --> 06:25.534
Boys, come in.

06:25.937 --> 06:30.241
You seen the boys? They were supposed
to be practicing for their road test...

06:30.242 --> 06:33.410
but looks like
they forgot the car part.

06:33.411 --> 06:36.046
What are you guys...into there?

06:36.047 --> 06:39.884
Orpheus is making me follow
that magic head thing l told you about.

06:39.885 --> 06:42.153
We're very close
to divining its will!

06:42.154 --> 06:46.157
He's got you doing it now.
You guys are cute together.

06:46.158 --> 06:49.127
l'm gonna go look for the boys.

06:49.161 --> 06:51.328
Story of my life.

06:51.329 --> 06:55.432
lt stopped. lt seems interested
in this automobile.

06:55.433 --> 06:59.737
Tell me. ls it associated
with some recent sin of yours?

06:59.738 --> 07:02.573
l wish! l can't remember the last time
l got lucky in that car.

07:02.574 --> 07:04.975
Unless you count the dollar
l found under the seat.

07:04.976 --> 07:08.012
Can't see why the beast would want...
What are you doing?

07:08.013 --> 07:10.814
That wasn't so hard, was it?
Problem solved.

07:10.815 --> 07:13.651
No, Mr. Venture.
You're still bound to the beast...

07:13.652 --> 07:17.972
by the gossamer,
invisible threads of psychic...

07:18.356 --> 07:20.856
Mother of God!
Help!

07:22.494 --> 07:25.996
l suggest we get in
and see where it takes us.

07:25.997 --> 07:27.932
What if it wants
to go back to Japan?

07:27.933 --> 07:30.968
Zee Venture problem
is very volatile.

07:30.969 --> 07:33.103
Ve must approach it with caution...

07:33.104 --> 07:35.773
but first ve need
to address our domestic issues.

07:35.774 --> 07:37.875
The floating cocoon
is in bad need of...

07:37.876 --> 07:40.844
The cocoon's fine.
l think the problem is you.

07:40.845 --> 07:42.546
He's right. Yeah.

07:42.547 --> 07:46.517
Everybody just thinks you're so great,
but you're just so not!

07:46.518 --> 07:48.452
- Who do you think you are?
- Come on.

07:48.453 --> 07:52.423
This guy just waltzes in here
with his huge baby-bearing hips...

07:52.424 --> 07:54.625
and he starts changing everything.

07:54.626 --> 07:57.027
Zat's not fair.
l never chose my build.

07:57.028 --> 08:01.098
l can't believe you guys are falling
for this sheep in wolf's clothing.

08:01.099 --> 08:05.135
He's trying to destroy us from the inside.
How can you not see that?

08:05.136 --> 08:08.005
Nobody talks to my hot,
new #2 like that!

08:08.006 --> 08:12.576
Black Guards, bring him
to the Chamber of A Thousand Torments!

08:12.577 --> 08:16.013
There you may deliver
torments 1 through 980.

08:16.014 --> 08:18.515
Killinger, l'm gonna
let you do torment 993...

08:18.516 --> 08:20.951
'cause you seem
to have bigger thumbs than me.

08:20.952 --> 08:24.955
Forgive me, but your methods
of discipline may be too Draconian.

08:24.956 --> 08:28.192
Give me a moment along
vith Mr. Henchman #24.

08:28.193 --> 08:30.594
l know l can change his mind.

08:30.595 --> 08:32.730
Vait.
l almost forgot.

08:32.731 --> 08:35.231
My Magic Murder Bag.

08:38.303 --> 08:39.602
We've stopped.

08:39.604 --> 08:42.172
- What is this place?
- A cheap motel.

08:42.173 --> 08:47.144
Perhaps it wants us to stay here
and rest until morning.

08:47.145 --> 08:50.414
Wait. l know what you're doing.
You're trying to get me in the sack!

08:50.415 --> 08:51.815
l beg your pardon!

08:51.816 --> 08:54.118
No wonder nobody
but you can see that head.

08:54.119 --> 08:55.185
How dare...?

08:55.186 --> 08:58.055
The tights, the jewelry,
always tagging along.

08:58.056 --> 09:01.191
''Let me get my big gay cloak,
and l'll join you!''

09:01.192 --> 09:06.402
- l'm trying to help you!
- Help me out of my speedsuit.

09:12.504 --> 09:16.804
Jock Rock my ass!
Listen to those lyrics, man.

09:16.841 --> 09:19.801
lt's all about love and longing.

09:20.312 --> 09:22.837
Yes, and hobbits, too.

09:23.882 --> 09:28.419
Look. lt's a metaphor.
They wrote about a lot of other stuff.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.220
Why am l arguing with a robot?

09:32.257 --> 09:33.590
Right up ahead.

09:33.591 --> 09:37.531
Don't think
we're done talking about this.

09:40.999 --> 09:43.499
Oh, no.

09:48.273 --> 09:50.773
Thank God.

09:57.282 --> 09:59.782
Crap. Myra's back.

10:03.188 --> 10:05.289
Well, isn't this new and different?

10:05.290 --> 10:08.225
- Hey, Dean.
- What?

10:08.259 --> 10:10.594
- l smell pee-pee.
- Well, what are you looking at me for?

10:10.595 --> 10:13.163
Dean, did you get pee-pee
scared again?

10:13.164 --> 10:15.866
No. Shut up.
Where are we this time?

10:15.867 --> 10:19.436
? Hush, little darling,
don't say a word ?

10:19.437 --> 10:21.872
? Mama's gonna buy you
a mockingbird ?

10:21.873 --> 10:23.107
OK. That is creepy.

10:23.108 --> 10:26.635
? And if that mockingbird
don't sing ?

10:27.579 --> 10:30.013
You're up. You can relax.

10:30.014 --> 10:32.616
The nightmare is finally over.

10:32.617 --> 10:34.118
No, it isn't.

10:34.119 --> 10:37.646
Hanky, my little,
snotty-puggy-dinky.

10:37.689 --> 10:41.458
Dean, Dean, Dean, Jimmy Dean,
Jimmy Dean sausages.

10:41.459 --> 10:43.861
You're safe now.

10:43.862 --> 10:46.490
You're with mommy!

10:52.303 --> 10:54.905
l have to bring
the prisoner his medication.

10:54.906 --> 10:57.641
- Give me the medication. l'll do it.
- OK, but...

10:57.642 --> 11:00.511
you have to administer it to him.
lt's a suppository.

11:00.512 --> 11:03.842
You know, it's up-the-butt medicine.

11:04.516 --> 11:06.383
Oh, don't knock or anything.

11:06.384 --> 11:09.420
lt's not like l live
with eighty guys and no women...

11:09.421 --> 11:12.022
so there is no chance
l'm masturbating.

11:12.023 --> 11:13.791
Chill. l thought l was rescuing you.

11:13.792 --> 11:16.360
What did he do to you?
What's in his Magic Murder Bag?

11:16.361 --> 11:18.262
Dude, have you even talked to him?

11:18.263 --> 11:20.364
He's great!
He's like Mr. Belvedere.

11:20.365 --> 11:23.734
He knows nothing about honor
or living by the sword.

11:23.735 --> 11:26.103
- He's not like us.
- What are you talking about?

11:26.104 --> 11:29.373
Seriously. That Killinger guy
has brainwashed the whole cocoon.

11:29.374 --> 11:32.443
Man, will you just talk to him already?
He's amazing!

11:32.444 --> 11:33.977
He cured my herpes.

11:33.978 --> 11:36.680
l bet he could even help you
with your problem.

11:36.681 --> 11:39.917
He's already got to you.
Don't touch me! Stay back.

11:39.918 --> 11:42.486
- Stay back, pod-person!
- All right. Whatever.

11:42.487 --> 11:44.188
You're not our mom!

11:44.189 --> 11:46.723
- You just can't be!
- On account of the crazy.

11:46.724 --> 11:50.994
Search your feelings, boys.
You know it to be true, so true.

11:50.995 --> 11:54.431
Funny how it seems always in time
but never in line for dreams.

11:54.432 --> 11:56.033
OK. We're losing her again.

11:56.034 --> 11:59.403
l bought a ticket to the world,
but now l've come back again!

11:59.404 --> 12:02.306
lf you're supposed to be our mom,
then why you got us tied up?

12:02.307 --> 12:04.508
People only do that
when they want to kill us.

12:04.509 --> 12:05.642
Or hold us for ransom.

12:05.643 --> 12:08.846
- Or touch us inappropriately.
- What? When? That never happ--

12:08.847 --> 12:11.448
Sergeant Hatred?
What? Did you block that out?

12:11.449 --> 12:15.118
Wait. You were passed out from the wine.
Most of it was awful. Trust me.

12:15.119 --> 12:19.323
This is no life for my sweet boys.
l would have never, ever...

12:19.324 --> 12:23.055
Rusty, why have you forsaken me?!

12:23.995 --> 12:28.225
Have l ever told you
how mommy and daddy met?

12:32.036 --> 12:34.536
Eat web!

12:35.440 --> 12:37.140
What are you...?

12:37.141 --> 12:38.475
Black Guards!

12:38.476 --> 12:41.245
He's covered my Magic Murder Bag
mit silly string.

12:41.246 --> 12:43.847
You can silence me,
but there will be others.

12:43.848 --> 12:46.476
Semper fidelis tyrannosaurus!

12:46.818 --> 12:48.485
lt's ''Sic semper tyrranis. ''

12:48.486 --> 12:51.255
You said,
''Always faithful terrible lizard.''

12:51.256 --> 12:53.756
l did? Cool!

12:55.994 --> 12:58.554
? l've got ice and snacks ?

12:58.596 --> 13:01.765
And here's some Mercurochrome
for you road burns.

13:01.766 --> 13:03.433
Thanks.
Sorry about earlier.

13:03.434 --> 13:06.503
l'm probably just still jet-lagged
and, you know...

13:06.504 --> 13:08.472
floating demon head and all.

13:08.473 --> 13:10.007
Apology accepted.

13:10.008 --> 13:14.877
Just stay on your side
of the room...tiger.

13:15.947 --> 13:18.447
Yes.

13:19.517 --> 13:22.619
You... You want to go
halfsies on a skin flick?

13:22.620 --> 13:24.121
'Kay.

13:24.122 --> 13:26.223
You might want to let me go.
Fair warning.

13:26.224 --> 13:28.425
'Cause when l get scared,
l get super gassy.

13:28.426 --> 13:31.628
Once l threw up on a kid
sitting in front of me in a tilt-a-whirl.

13:31.629 --> 13:34.464
Don't forget when you passed out
on The Monarch's cat.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.900
Yeah. l killed Mr. Mostly Mittens.
Oh, my God!

13:36.901 --> 13:38.569
You're 24!

13:38.570 --> 13:41.939
You're still under the hypnospell.
OK. This is for your own good.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.908
Look into my eyes.
You're extremely relaxed...

13:44.909 --> 13:47.511
and you feel the urge to let me go.

13:47.512 --> 13:52.015
You know in your heart that l will
rescue you and save the whole cocoon.

13:52.016 --> 13:54.851
Will you knock it off?
l'm just taking you to your room.

13:54.852 --> 13:58.922
And that is what you will tell them.
Your limbs are getting heavy.

13:58.923 --> 14:01.892
So heavy. Sleep.

14:01.926 --> 14:04.426
Sleep. Sl--

14:04.662 --> 14:06.997
Crap! l fell on my cellular pho--

14:06.998 --> 14:10.559
Sleepy, so sleepy!

14:12.170 --> 14:16.540
He was my first job,
fresh out of the OSl academy.

14:16.541 --> 14:19.276
l was still just a girl.
What did l know?

14:19.277 --> 14:22.679
''Never let your guard down,
never let him out of your sight...

14:22.680 --> 14:25.180
''never fall in love.''

14:25.617 --> 14:29.186
That's what they taught me.
But l couldn't help myself!

14:29.187 --> 14:31.655
Your father...

14:31.656 --> 14:34.124
l spent 24 hours a day with him.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.827
First, there were casual glances...

14:36.828 --> 14:41.527
the occasional brush of the hand,
clever innuendo.

14:42.567 --> 14:45.067
lt was inevitable.

14:46.471 --> 14:50.339
Something would happen
sooner or later.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.185
? Then the pleasure stopped... ?

14:55.913 --> 14:59.280
No, no. lt was not ooky!

14:59.317 --> 15:04.054
lt was the most wonderful,
passionate night of either of our lives!

15:04.055 --> 15:05.589
And nine months later...

15:05.590 --> 15:09.660
you two perfect wet,
little pink kittens came into the world...

15:09.661 --> 15:11.595
from out of my body.

15:11.596 --> 15:13.664
Oh, double eww!

15:13.665 --> 15:17.601
l just didn't know what else to do.
He's taken over the whole cocoon...

15:17.602 --> 15:21.104
and you're our last hope. Oh, this?
This is the new Monarch Mobile.

15:21.105 --> 15:24.341
That's how bad it's gotten.
lt doesn't even burn nitrous.

15:24.342 --> 15:26.209
lt's, like, a family car.
My God!

15:26.210 --> 15:28.979
Once he painted wings on it
with water-based paint...

15:28.980 --> 15:32.449
so, when it rained, it dripped off
and looked like we tie-dyed it...

15:32.450 --> 15:35.819
like we took it to Magic Mountain
and did that spin-art thing on it.

15:35.820 --> 15:38.855
- You remember spin-art?
- Yes, l remember spin-art.

15:38.856 --> 15:42.296
- Spin-art was so cool.
- Just drive.

15:43.761 --> 15:44.928
Thanks, buddy.

15:44.929 --> 15:49.099
You ain't much in a fight,
but you're good at rescue and recovery.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.402
Yeah, l thought she was gone for good
after the last time too...

15:52.403 --> 15:58.433
but some crazy people won't stay
locked up, you know what l mean?

16:04.015 --> 16:07.617
That's beautiful, H.E.L.P.eR.
What was that, Shel Silverstein?

16:07.618 --> 16:11.088
Well, l don't think Maya Angelou
was talking about this chick.

16:11.089 --> 16:12.789
She's as deadly as they come...

16:12.790 --> 16:17.794
and if she hurts those boys again,
l'll take her down permanently this time.

16:17.795 --> 16:20.230
No, not Maya Angelou.

16:20.231 --> 16:25.661
Just keep scanning
those tire tracks with your infrared, OK?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.873
OK, OK!
l'm up damn it!

16:31.909 --> 16:35.145
Your father had me locked away,
locked me away, away...

16:35.146 --> 16:39.082
so he could have you all to himself,
so he could fill you with his lies!

16:39.083 --> 16:41.351
He never once
told you about me, has he?

16:41.352 --> 16:43.787
Not in all your 19 years!

16:43.788 --> 16:45.589
- We're 16.
- You see?

16:45.590 --> 16:48.525
See what, crazy lady?
Make sense!

16:48.526 --> 16:50.093
He's brainwashed you...

16:50.094 --> 16:52.996
with those lie machines
he makes you sleep in.

16:52.997 --> 16:56.867
That's why l had to kidnap you.
To save you!

16:56.868 --> 17:00.468
And here are
your brothers and sisters.

17:00.505 --> 17:02.973
They're hungry.

17:02.974 --> 17:06.376
Oh, my babies!
You must be starved, too.

17:06.377 --> 17:11.537
Let mama feed you, my thirsty babies.
Let mama love you!

17:18.021 --> 17:19.089
May l help you?

17:19.089 --> 17:21.758
lsn't it a big early
for a costume party?

17:21.759 --> 17:24.426
Why, you throwing one, Dracula?

17:24.428 --> 17:28.127
My friend and l would like to check out.

17:31.669 --> 17:33.036
? l feel the spirit... ?

17:33.037 --> 17:36.773
Mr. Venture!
l could use some assistance!

17:36.774 --> 17:40.644
l can't believe l'm hanging out with you.
l always thought we'd get along.

17:40.645 --> 17:43.980
You were kind of distant,
which is cool, you know. That's fine.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.149
You know what rules?
That outfit rules.

17:46.150 --> 17:50.787
Dude, l just copped an accidental feel.
Wicked sorry.

17:50.788 --> 17:53.456
- What are you doing? That's alarmed.
- Yes. l know.

17:53.457 --> 17:59.247
l'm the one who installed it.
Now, shut up and follow my lead.

18:00.565 --> 18:03.033
Well.

18:03.034 --> 18:05.569
So you as good at fighting
as you are at talking?

18:05.570 --> 18:10.380
Hell, no. Look at me!
l'm more of a weapons expert.

18:15.479 --> 18:17.948
That is so excellent.

18:17.949 --> 18:20.550
l like to do that, too. lt's soft.

18:20.551 --> 18:24.387
Do not follow me.
Just stay here and do...whatever.

18:24.388 --> 18:25.755
OK.

18:25.756 --> 18:28.956
Yeah. l am totally falling for her.

18:29.660 --> 18:33.296
Thank the maker! l've been holding
that back for, like, two hours.

18:33.297 --> 18:36.066
Safety first.
Bukley buck buck.

18:36.067 --> 18:39.369
- Daddy!
- Hello, boys. l see you've met Myra.

18:39.370 --> 18:42.005
Did she tell you how
she burnt down our house yet?

18:42.006 --> 18:44.941
No hellos for me?
Now, Rusty...

18:44.976 --> 18:48.011
is that any way
to treat your forever girl?

18:48.012 --> 18:52.282
Dean, tell this lunatic that my lawyer has
advised me not to communicate with her.

18:52.283 --> 18:57.153
My dad's lawyer has advised him
not to communicate with you.

18:57.154 --> 18:58.588
Stay close.

18:58.589 --> 19:00.490
Any of your weapons still work?

19:00.491 --> 19:04.194
All right, well...
Keep your helicopter blades on...

19:04.195 --> 19:09.435
wave your arms around, squeal a lot.
That might be scary.

19:10.768 --> 19:13.268
Damn it!

19:14.005 --> 19:17.099
All right.
We're doing this.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.677
Ten and two, ten and two.

19:22.980 --> 19:25.480
? My muse is calling ?

19:45.569 --> 19:46.736
Everyone OK?

19:46.737 --> 19:49.439
- Everyone except mommy.
- She'll be all right.

19:49.440 --> 19:53.677
- l feel like Catherine the Great.
- Where's Dr. ''O''?

19:53.678 --> 19:56.647
They smell my cat.

19:57.782 --> 20:00.517
Wait, wait, wait.
So we never attack Venture?

20:00.518 --> 20:01.918
Zere is no need.

20:01.919 --> 20:04.521
My plans for a summit
are both simple und elegant.

20:04.522 --> 20:05.989
And completely retarded!

20:05.990 --> 20:08.458
Did you just mumble something
about a summit?

20:08.459 --> 20:11.094
That is not crushing Venture!
You don't get it.

20:11.095 --> 20:12.729
- We have to...
- You should move.

20:12.730 --> 20:15.865
You don't want her to land on you
when she falls from zee ceiling.

20:15.866 --> 20:19.066
When who calls for a healing? What?

20:19.670 --> 20:22.973
- What the hell is she doing here?
- She has come to rescue you.

20:22.974 --> 20:25.608
- From what?
- From loneliness, you silly-billy.

20:25.609 --> 20:30.349
- Who the hell are you?
- Dr. Henry Killinger. Vait.

20:30.748 --> 20:33.616
Here. Give these
to zee lovely woman...

20:33.617 --> 20:36.786
and zis is for you.
Mr. Zee Monarch's journal.

20:36.787 --> 20:39.155
His love for you
is spelled out on every page...

20:39.156 --> 20:41.391
and there are
some very nice drawings, also.

20:41.392 --> 20:43.960
- That's private!
- Love is not private.

20:43.961 --> 20:46.461
Love is to be shared.

20:47.431 --> 20:48.732
l have locked you in.

20:48.733 --> 20:52.102
Neither of you may leave
until you have reached compromise.

20:52.103 --> 20:54.838
Good luck,
and may love show you zee way.

20:54.839 --> 20:57.774
Say good-bye
to all your pretty children for me.

20:57.775 --> 21:00.043
Can you understand
what he's saying?

21:00.044 --> 21:01.578
Like, half the time.

21:01.579 --> 21:06.016
My umbrella is stuck on something.
l require assistance.

21:06.017 --> 21:09.953
- So is she or isn't she?
- OK, Hank, look!

21:09.954 --> 21:14.190
She used to be Power Cat
on American Gladiator.

21:14.191 --> 21:17.927
Show gets tanked,
she checks herself into the nuthouse.

21:17.928 --> 21:20.930
Every couple of years,
she puts on the old costume...

21:20.931 --> 21:25.235
kidnaps you or tries to kill your dad
or burns down the compound.

21:25.236 --> 21:27.837
Depends on what meds
she's coming off of.

21:27.838 --> 21:29.973
How come
we don't remember her then?

21:29.974 --> 21:33.676
Look. You don't remember
because you're cl--

21:33.677 --> 21:36.212
- Cl-cl-cl--
- l can't help feeling ...

21:36.213 --> 21:38.581
like we're not getting
the whole story.

21:38.582 --> 21:41.117
Right! Maybe she was telling the truth.

21:41.118 --> 21:44.578
All right! So l f-- her!
What of it?

22:13.651 --> 22:16.686
Come, Liebe-Scheusal.
You tried your best.

22:16.687 --> 22:20.423
Yes. You failed to reunite them,
but look at it zis way.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.259
You saved his boys,
und zat's what counts.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.596
Compromise, my friend,
is zee essence of diplomacy...

22:26.597 --> 22:29.766
and diplomacy
is zee cornerstone of love.

22:29.767 --> 22:32.565
? Sveet love ?

22:32.603 --> 22:35.572
That is bloody good soup!
