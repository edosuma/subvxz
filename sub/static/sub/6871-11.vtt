WEBVTT

00:05.546 --> 00:08.404
I don't know but I think
we're pretty close. What?

00:08.503 --> 00:11.399
Well blame these road signs.
They don't have any vowels.

00:11.660 --> 00:13.606
Yes, and thanks for watching AJ.

00:13.726 --> 00:17.709
I-- No, as a matter of fact I don't
think it's a good opportunity to

00:17.711 --> 00:21.947
quote "work some of that fat off
her", unquote. I--

00:21.949 --> 00:26.618
Mother, she's a goddamn baby!
No, I have to go so--

00:26.620 --> 00:30.288
I will! And if I find out you gave
her diet pills, Mother, no kidding,

00:30.290 --> 00:33.258
- I will have you arrested!
- Hmm? Do what?

00:33.260 --> 00:36.261
- Who's having a rest?
- I heard you, now I gotta go. Goodbye.

00:36.263 --> 00:39.897
- Hey, sleepyhead.
- Hey you.

00:39.899 --> 00:43.901
- Mmm, man, I was out.
- Yeah you were.

00:43.903 --> 00:46.904
Where are we?
Seriously, what is this, the Shire?

00:46.906 --> 00:50.041
- No, uh-- it's--
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:50.043 --> 00:53.044
What the shit? Where are we?
Where is AJ?

00:53.046 --> 00:56.047
- She's with Mother. Calm down, I--
- Why am I in a car, in a

00:56.049 --> 01:00.351
trench coat, and lingerie? Why am I in-- Oh
my God, there was a vagina in your sink!

01:00.353 --> 01:04.321
- Okay, technically yes, but--
- I caught you cheating on me.

01:04.322 --> 01:07.291
- No you didn't because no I wasn't.
- Stop the car, let me out.

01:07.293 --> 01:10.294
- You stop it now! Calm down?
- Lana, calm down.

01:10.296 --> 01:13.397
- Yes! I can explain if you--
- Yeah, explain how I just woke

01:13.399 --> 01:21.251
up in weird clothes in a weird
car, in-- Archer, where are we?

01:21.371 --> 01:24.074
- Wales.
- Wales?

01:24.076 --> 01:28.745
- Yeah, surprise is ruined.
- No it's not! I am extremely surprised!

01:28.747 --> 01:32.016
- Really? - Because the last thing I
remember, we were arguing in

01:32.018 --> 01:36.320
- your bedroom! - Yeah, I wanted to explain
everything but you were totally

01:36.322 --> 01:39.990
freaking out, so I thought let's go somewhere
neutral, you know? Talk things out.

01:39.992 --> 01:44.327
So we're going to this little farm right on
the coast. It's remote but it's got this

01:44.329 --> 01:49.699
real, kinda rugged beauty, you
know? It's actually very romantic.

01:49.701 --> 01:55.611
Oh. So just curious, what happened
between your bedroom and right now?

01:55.731 --> 01:57.974
Well you were hysterical,
Lana, so I thought the best

01:57.976 --> 01:59.928
thing to do would be

02:00.048 --> 02:02.960
inject you with a tranquilizer,
drive you to a private airfield, put you

02:03.080 --> 02:07.738
on a CIA plane, fly you overnight to
Wales and then that brings us to now.

02:07.858 --> 02:11.153
- Huh. - And I know drugging women
isn't cool at all, ever, and

02:11.155 --> 02:15.691
obviously I would never, ever do that
for any sort of sexual assaulty reason.

02:15.693 --> 02:18.694
I mean for one thing, I'd never need to.

02:18.696 --> 02:20.883
That's what the whole fight was
about in the first place, right?

02:21.003 --> 02:22.604
Women throwing themselves at--

02:22.724 --> 02:26.968
Stop the car.

02:26.970 --> 02:30.538
- Choking-- - Sorry, maybe you can't hear
me over the sound of all the

02:30.540 --> 02:35.142
blood vessels bursting in your
eyes. I said stop.

02:35.144 --> 02:41.082
Ahh!

02:41.084 --> 02:44.551
Ahh!

02:45.686 --> 02:51.959
Well, I hate to say it, but you were right.

02:51.961 --> 02:58.665
- It is kind of romantic.
- Yeah, right?

02:58.667 --> 03:02.502
I'm pretty sure there's a
fireplace.

03:41.237 --> 03:47.037
There, see? Quaint little farmhouse,
a cozy little fire going.

03:47.146 --> 03:49.550
I mean this place is right out
of a fairytale.

03:49.670 --> 03:53.018
Yeah, a fairytale in which the heroine
is drugged and kidnapped.

03:53.138 --> 03:55.781
You realize that's like every
fairytale.

03:56.055 --> 03:58.855
- I do now that you mention it!
- Don't yell at me.

03:58.857 --> 04:02.258
- I'm not the one advocating rape
and child cannibalism. - No!

04:02.260 --> 04:05.362
You're the one whose ex-girlfriend
left her robot vagina in your sink.

04:05.364 --> 04:09.999
Unbeknownst to me, Lana! Jesus, we've
been through this like ten times already.

04:10.001 --> 04:13.740
Well, sorry I'm hazy on the details of what
happened right before I was drugged

04:13.741 --> 04:16.906
- and stuffed in a cargo hold.
- It wasn't the c-- You were in a seat.

04:16.906 --> 04:21.249
- Is that supposed to make it better?
- That is better! Like, empirically.

04:21.369 --> 04:23.178
- I am leaving.
- No no, wait, wait, wait.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.782
- Let me explain. - If you don't let go
of me, you're gonna have to explain how

04:26.784 --> 04:31.754
- those tampons got driven into your brain.
- Thanks for these, by the way.

04:31.756 --> 04:35.876
And Lana, I swear I didn't call
Katya. I just came home and there she was.

04:35.996 --> 04:38.241
And why would she just show up?

04:38.361 --> 04:42.530
- I think the idiots called her.
- What idiots?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.800
- Alrighty, can someone give me a hand?
- But, Doctor, I thought the

04:45.802 --> 04:48.803
- patient was getting the hand.
- Speaking of hands, Nurse, I'm--

04:48.805 --> 04:51.806
- Overplaying yours? - Well I was gonna say
"putty in yours",

04:51.808 --> 04:55.168
- my dear, but I'll have to hand it to ya.
- Hm, keep your hands to yourself, Doctor.

04:55.176 --> 04:58.241
Can we have a show of hands?
Who thinks this is getting out of hand?

04:58.361 --> 05:02.950
Goddamn it!
Can you please shut up

05:02.952 --> 05:05.930
and sew on my robot hand?

05:08.287 --> 05:12.826
- Hand job. - So they call Katya because
they're jealous we're dating.

05:12.828 --> 05:16.163
- She shows up-- - Unbeknownst.
- And nothing happens, even

05:16.165 --> 05:20.034
though all your clothes get burned off,
champagne gets jizzed everywhere and her vag

05:20.036 --> 05:24.604
- winds up in the sink. - Yes.
- So, you're saying it was--

05:24.606 --> 05:28.108
- Literally a farce. Exactly, yes!
- Ah.

05:28.110 --> 05:31.644
Lana, come on. Whose life through no,
or sometimes maybe moderate fault

05:31.646 --> 05:35.548
- of his own, is as farcical as mine?
- Hmm.

05:35.550 --> 05:38.851
- You still shouldn't have drugged me.
- No, I know, that was--

05:38.853 --> 05:41.471
Extremely uncool.

05:42.282 --> 05:43.972
Mmm, that's not though.
Holy shit.

05:44.092 --> 05:49.094
Right?
Glengoolie: for the best of times.

05:49.096 --> 05:50.697
And after we're done here, well

05:50.817 --> 05:53.920
we'll have to rent a new car,
but we can drive up to the distillery and--

05:54.040 --> 05:56.969
Done here, at our romantic
fairytale getaway where you

05:56.971 --> 06:01.240
make up for all the idiot Archer
shit you pulled over the past 24 hours?

06:01.242 --> 06:04.744
Yes, and-- Here's the thing.

06:04.746 --> 06:07.712
What the--
Freeze!

06:07.714 --> 06:11.015
- Whoa, whoa, steady on.
- Freeze or I'll-- I have no weapon. Archer!

06:11.135 --> 06:16.455
- Ah, so you're Archer.
- Uh, yes.

06:16.457 --> 06:20.366
- And are those tampons?
- Also yes.

06:20.486 --> 06:22.909
Right, so if he's Archer,

06:23.029 --> 06:27.398
- I suppose that makes you Lana Kane.
- I-- Yes, actually.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.058
And I suppose that makes you--
Who the hell are you?

06:30.178 --> 06:31.351
Lloyd Llewellyn.

06:31.471 --> 06:34.811
This is my brother, David.
Say hello to the lady, David.

06:34.931 --> 06:36.170
Hello, lady.

06:36.290 --> 06:40.445
Hello, human giant. And follow up
question: why the hell are you here?

06:40.447 --> 06:44.582
- Ah. Have you not told her?
- Yeah, so, even though it's a

06:44.584 --> 06:51.687
romantic fairytale getaway, there's
also kind of a work component to it.

06:51.807 --> 06:55.860
- Lana?
- What?

06:56.464 --> 06:58.863
Come on, it's like 30 bucks
a glass.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.835
So if I understand the situation correctly,

07:04.955 --> 07:07.709
we're supposed to help
these terrorists who--

07:07.829 --> 07:10.516
Well you obviously don't
understand the situation,

07:10.636 --> 07:13.298
because we're not terrorists.
We're freedom fighters.

07:13.418 --> 07:15.495
They're the Free Wales Army, Lana.

07:15.615 --> 07:18.876
- "Fe godwn ni eto." - Oh yeah, that's--
that's right, David. Good lad.

07:18.996 --> 07:20.415
Leg hurts.

07:20.534 --> 07:23.902
- Yes, it will do, Dav. You've been shot.
- So we're supposed to help

07:23.904 --> 07:27.924
George and Lennie here out of the
country because they're wanted by MI5?

07:28.044 --> 07:31.609
- Yeah, that's what Mother said.
- MI5, from England.

07:31.611 --> 07:34.612
- Our ally.
- Well they're no ally to Wales.

07:34.614 --> 07:38.116
What are you-- It's the
same country, Lloyd!

07:38.118 --> 07:41.886
- Tell that to Dyffryn Thebwys.
- Duffer who?

07:41.888 --> 07:45.923
Dyffryn Thebwys. It was a town in Wales
that had stood proudly for a thousand

07:45.925 --> 07:51.095
years until the Saesnig-- the
English, deliberately flooded it.

07:51.097 --> 07:54.231
- Oh my God, to drown everybody?
- No, to make a reservoir.

07:54.233 --> 07:58.135
They needed water! So they built a dam
and that flooded Dyffryn Thebwys, and

07:58.137 --> 08:03.052
- all the people lost their homes.
- My God, countless thousands of them!

08:03.172 --> 08:05.193
- Well, 48.
- Thousand!

08:05.313 --> 08:07.476
- No, just 48. You know, four dozen.
- Are you--

08:07.596 --> 08:09.980
Still though! So now
they're all homeless?

08:10.100 --> 08:12.986
Well, no.
They were compensated, so they

08:13.106 --> 08:16.619
got new houses somewhere else and
well, in many cases, much nicer ones.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.589
- Then what's the problem?
- Who are you, Josephine Stalin?

08:19.591 --> 08:22.592
- That shit wouldn't happen in America.
- Yes it would, and does, all

08:22.594 --> 08:27.327
the time. The TVA has flooded thousands of
Americans out of their homes.

08:27.447 --> 08:30.250
- The what?
- Tennessee Valley Authority?

08:30.487 --> 08:33.970
Remember <i>Deliverance?</i>
<i>How the whole valley was gonna</i>

08:33.972 --> 08:37.039
- <i>be flooded?</i>
<i>- Lana, I hate to break it to</i>

08:37.041 --> 08:41.342
you-- I even hate to say it out
loud, but <i>Deliverance</i> was just a movie.

08:41.462 --> 08:46.281
Oh, my God. So what exactly
are you wanted by MI5 for?

08:46.283 --> 08:49.685
- Uh, we tried to blow up a dam.
- A dam?

08:49.687 --> 08:51.786
What, to flood a bunch of other
people out of their homes?

08:51.906 --> 08:56.092
- Well not real people. Just English ones.
- Excuse me.

08:56.094 --> 09:00.329
Christ, is she always this angry?

09:00.331 --> 09:03.499
- She's not mad at you, Lloyd. She's mad at me.
- For what?

09:03.501 --> 09:07.769
Um, okay. So I was engaged to this
smoking hot Russian woman.

09:07.771 --> 09:10.696
- Lieutenant Ginger Bayliss.
- Clamp.

09:10.945 --> 09:12.567
Played by Odessa Cleveland.

09:12.687 --> 09:15.087
Who later had a guest spot as
a nurse on <i>Trapper John, M.D.</i>

09:15.159 --> 09:16.261
<i>What?</i>

09:16.381 --> 09:19.714
<i>Starring Pernell Roberts as</i>
<i>the titular Trapper John, somehow.</i>

09:19.716 --> 09:23.251
<i>- In a drama, which was totally weird.</i>
<i>- But not as weird as Ed Asner.</i>

09:23.253 --> 09:25.396
<i>Mary Tyler Moore's</i> Lou Grant.

09:25.516 --> 09:28.689
Playing Lou Grant in the show
<i>Lou Grant,</i> which was also a drama.

09:28.809 --> 09:32.779
Okay, yeah, but besides one nurse,
<i>M*A S*H</i> didn't have any black characters.

09:32.899 --> 09:36.324
- Actually it did have one.
- And his name was Spearchucker.

09:36.444 --> 09:38.854
- What?
- Spearchucker Jones.

09:38.974 --> 09:41.480
- I mean--
- Okay yeah, maybe in the book

09:41.600 --> 09:44.103
or that crazy football movie,
but I'm talking about--

09:44.223 --> 09:45.216
Yeah, the show!

09:45.336 --> 09:48.650
- On network television!
- In America, and not that long ago.

09:48.770 --> 09:51.874
- But how is this even possible?
<i>- Well I know it may seem strange.</i>

09:51.876 --> 09:54.112
<i>What, aiding our ally's enemies?</i>

09:54.232 --> 09:55.571
<i>Well it makes sense!</i>

09:55.691 --> 09:58.395
<i>When you're the biggest kid in</i>
<i>the schoolyard, if your little</i>

09:58.515 --> 10:01.884
<i>- friends have a bully--</i>
<i>- You want them to come running to you.</i>

10:01.886 --> 10:05.087
- <i>Exactly. And Slater says--</i>
- <i>Wait, you talked to Slater?</i>

10:05.089 --> 10:10.225
<i>Yes, Lana. Obviously I've spoken to
Slater, and he says the CIA does this</i>

10:10.227 --> 10:12.154
<i>sort of thing all the time, so--</i>

10:12.274 --> 10:14.811
<i>So, did he say why he keeps</i>
<i>giving us these assignments that</i>

10:14.931 --> 10:17.999
- <i>always seem to blow up in our faces?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

10:18.001 --> 10:21.370
- <i>Although speaking of blowing up--</i>
<i>- Malory, she's a baby, and</i>

10:21.372 --> 10:25.274
<i>she weighs exactly as much as she's
supposed to, so you better be feeding her!</i>

10:25.276 --> 10:28.276
<i>I am, it's just-</i>

10:28.278 --> 10:31.190
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Please.</i>

10:31.310 --> 10:37.390
<i>As if I wouldn't feed you.
Now who wants a wittle ice chip?</i>

10:37.510 --> 10:42.879
<i>No? I suppose you'd prefer a nice</i>
<i>big bottle of that liquid butter fat.</i>

10:42.999 --> 10:46.661
<i>Goat, swear to Christ, I'll</i>

10:46.663 --> 10:50.397
<i>have your hide as boots and the</i>
<i>rest of you as a curry! Go on, shoo!</i>

10:50.399 --> 10:53.700
<i>Shoo! Sh-- hit.</i>
<i>Shit, shit!</i>

10:53.702 --> 10:57.637
- <i>Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.</i>
<i>- No shit, I'm telling</i>

10:57.639 --> 11:02.810
<i>you guys, Katya looked absolutely amazing.</i>
<i>The tiniest, laciest lingerie</i>

11:02.812 --> 11:06.246
<i>you've ever seen.</i>
<i>Sexy stiletto heels.</i>

11:06.248 --> 11:10.284
<i>- And a good body, huh?</i>
<i>- Good? I mean, you're from the UK, so</i>

11:10.286 --> 11:13.953
<i>you don't have anything to</i>
<i>compare it to, but no Lloyd. Not good.</i>

11:13.955 --> 11:17.290
- <i>Insane.</i>
<i>- David!</i>

11:17.292 --> 11:20.742
<i>And she was just
like rubbing all over me.</i>

11:20.862 --> 11:22.877
<i>But nothing happened?</i>

11:22.997 --> 11:26.731
<i>No, nothing.
Well, except for the goodbye kiss</i>

11:26.851 --> 11:31.221
<i>which was definitely NSF</i>
<i>Wales, if you know what I mean.</i>

11:31.341 --> 11:32.854
<i>Oh, you little--</i>

11:32.974 --> 11:36.630
<i>I say, pardon me.
Madam. Hello?</i>

11:36.750 --> 11:40.998
<i>- Lana, hey. We were just-- not talking.</i>
<i>- Shut up.</i>

11:41.118 --> 11:42.131
<i>Already was, so--</i>

11:42.251 --> 11:46.452
<i>So, is it possible you two</i>
<i>were followed here by MI5?</i>

11:46.724 --> 11:52.240
<i>- Ummmmmm... Yeah.</i>
<i>- What?!</i>

11:52.360 --> 11:53.785
<i>- Yeah, they're quite good.</i>
<i>- Son of a--</i>

11:53.836 --> 11:54.812
<i>Archer, passport.</i>

11:54.853 --> 11:56.654
<i>- What, why do you--?</i>
<i>- Give me your passport!</i>

11:56.895 --> 11:58.068
<i>Here.</i>

11:58.442 --> 12:01.536
<i>- Ah, for the love of-- "Randy Randalman"?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:01.656 --> 12:03.588
<i>Randy grew up on the wrong side
of the tracks,</i>

12:03.708 --> 12:05.853
ran with a bad crowd,
got into some trouble,

12:05.973 --> 12:09.574
<i>went to juvie. Uh, he worked in the
mess hall there, fell in love with</i>

12:09.576 --> 12:12.845
<i>cooking, and so when he got out he went to
culinary school and now he's got</i>

12:12.965 --> 12:14.380
two restaurants, Lana,

12:14.500 --> 12:19.150
<i>one Michelin star and a marriage that's
on the rocks. He's here to go balls deep on</i>

12:19.152 --> 12:21.501
<i>farm to table, you know.</i>
<i>Trying to get back to basics.</i>

12:21.621 --> 12:22.334
<i>Archer--</i>

12:22.454 --> 12:24.453
<i>Like that time Rocky went to Russia.</i>

12:24.573 --> 12:27.101
<i>Just get in that closet over</i>
<i>there and take Lurch with you.</i>

12:27.221 --> 12:27.800
<i>David.</i>

12:27.920 --> 12:30.457
<i>Wait, he's the one they're looking for.</i>
<i>Why am I getting in the closet?</i>

12:30.577 --> 12:33.031
<i>Because I said so!</i>
<i>How is your American accent?</i>

12:33.151 --> 12:34.404
<i>Um, I guess it's okay,</i>

12:34.524 --> 12:36.485
I mean like, you know, like, people are
always like, you know.

12:36.605 --> 12:39.965
<i>- Like, you know, it's crap?</i>
<i>- No dude, people really dig it.</i>

12:40.085 --> 12:44.428
<i>People from where, dude? Quebec?</i>
<i>He's the one who should be in the closet!</i>

12:44.548 --> 12:46.976
<i>No, wait.</i>
<i>Oh, hang on.</i>

12:46.978 --> 12:49.735
<i>- Lana, why am I in the closet?</i>
<i>- Because I said so!</i>

12:49.855 --> 12:52.031
<i>I think this'll really help</i>
<i>sell it.</i>

12:52.032 --> 12:54.354
<i>What?</i>
<i>Randy doesn't wear nerd goggles!</i>

12:54.470 --> 12:56.162
<i>He's a culinary bad boy!</i>

12:56.282 --> 12:58.162
<i>Open the door, please.</i>

12:58.260 --> 13:02.325
<i>- Get in the closet!</i>
<i>- I am getting in the closet</i>

13:02.327 --> 13:05.806
<i>because I choose to get in the closet.</i>
<i>Come on, Gort.</i>

13:06.130 --> 13:07.689
<i>David.</i>

13:08.064 --> 13:11.527
<i>Okay, Randy.</i>
<i>Follow my lead.</i>

13:11.769 --> 13:14.209
- <i>Yes?</i>
<i>- Good afternoon.</i>

13:14.329 --> 13:17.340
<i>My name is Bardsley.</i>
<i>I'm with MI5.</i>

13:17.460 --> 13:22.744
<i>- MI5, my goodness! Please, do come in.</i>
<i>- Uh, what's the problem here?</i>

13:22.746 --> 13:26.049
<i>- Well the problem, Mister um--</i>
<i>- Randalman, Randy Randalman.</i>

13:26.169 --> 13:27.064
<i>I'm an American.</i>

13:27.184 --> 13:30.780
<i>Right. Uh-- - Uh yeah, I'm here
to learn about farm tables.</i>

13:30.900 --> 13:33.755
<i>- I beg your pardon?</i>
<i>- I thought it was dams.</i>

13:33.757 --> 13:36.531
<i>- Shh! Come on, buddy.</i>
<i>- David.</i>

13:36.651 --> 13:40.123
<i>Farm to table, he meant to say.</i>
<i>He's a chef.</i>

13:40.243 --> 13:43.899
<i>- An American chef.</i>
<i>- He knows you're American,</i> honey.

13:44.019 --> 13:48.430
<i>Uh, the reason I'm here.</i>
<i>We're searching for Welsh terrorists.</i>

13:48.550 --> 13:52.473
<i>Welsh terrorists?</i>
<i>Is there even such a thing?</i>

13:52.475 --> 13:56.660
<i>Yes, I'm afraid so.</i>
<i>The self-styled Free Wales Army.</i>

13:56.780 --> 13:57.883
<i>"Fe godwn ni--"</i>

13:58.003 --> 14:01.630
<i>Shh! If you stay really, really
quiet, I will buy you a puppy</i>

14:01.750 --> 14:05.207
<i>that you will probably
accidentally strangle.</i>

14:05.327 --> 14:06.601
<i>And we've reason to believe</i>

14:06.721 --> 14:10.621
<i>they're in the area, and that one of them is
wounded. So we're canvassing all the farms,</i>

14:10.741 --> 14:12.425
<i>and when we saw the</i>
<i>damaged vehicle--</i>

14:12.545 --> 14:14.700
<i>A bee flew in it and I crashed.</i>

14:14.820 --> 14:17.964
<i>A bee flew into a</i><i>convertible?</i>

14:17.966 --> 14:23.129
<i>Look, our marriage is on the rocks, and
also I have two Michelin tires, so--</i>

14:23.379 --> 14:27.139
<i>Right. May I just see your passport</i>
<i>again, please?</i>

14:27.141 --> 14:30.309
<i>Oh good heavens.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

14:30.311 --> 14:34.279
<i>- What the-- Shit!</i>
<i>- Mmm, whoa.</i>

14:34.281 --> 14:40.152
<i>This is actually why we're here in Wales.</i>
<i>To try to save our marriage.</i>

14:40.909 --> 14:45.157
<i>Oh, my God, baby.</i>
<i>I think it's working.</i>

14:46.991 --> 14:50.942
Are you joking or insane? Do you
really expect me to believe

14:51.062 --> 14:54.110
you came to Wales for a romantic getaway?

14:54.230 --> 14:56.026
Easy, bro.
Wales is kickass!

14:56.146 --> 15:01.385
Honey! I do, because we did.
I mean if this weren't a romantic getaway,

15:01.505 --> 15:05.181
would I be doing this?
Mmm!

15:06.232 --> 15:10.336
- What the shit?
- Or this?

15:10.660 --> 15:14.488
Closet rampage!

15:14.608 --> 15:19.337
Right, then obviously I've made
an extremely embarrassing mistake. So uh--

15:19.457 --> 15:22.471
- What the shit, Lana?
- Aha!

15:22.970 --> 15:24.242
"Aha", what?

15:24.362 --> 15:27.702
- Who is this man?
- I-- Wait, shit. Who am I?

15:27.822 --> 15:31.095
You're Lloyd Llewellyn, if I
don't miss my guess, which means

15:31.215 --> 15:35.425
- your brother David can't be too far off.
- Uh, in the closet, jacking off in a hat.

15:35.545 --> 15:36.522
- David!
- No I'm not.

15:36.642 --> 15:39.990
Yes you are! And I'm not
Lloyd Llewellyn. He is!

15:40.110 --> 15:43.525
- Oh, Archer.
- Archer? As in Sterling Archer?

15:43.645 --> 15:47.028
- Yes, you idiot!
- As in Sterling Archer of the CIA?

15:47.148 --> 15:50.253
- I mean no, you idiot. I mean--
- My God.

15:50.373 --> 15:56.884
- Then you must be Lana-- Ugh!
- Way to go, Randy.

15:57.004 --> 15:59.394
- Ugh, how is this Randy's fault?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:59.514 --> 16:03.148
Did someone else just barge in here yelling
their idiot head off about being with the CIA?

16:03.268 --> 16:07.236
Oh, I don't know. Was someone else making
out with Frodo P. Gryffindor here,

16:07.356 --> 16:10.824
- just to make someone else jealous?
- Well, maybe now you know how I feel.

16:10.944 --> 16:14.923
Actually I don't know how you feel Lana,
because I didn't make out with Katya!

16:15.043 --> 16:19.573
Oh no? You didn't jam your fat tongue
down her throat on that goodbye kiss?

16:19.693 --> 16:21.658
You were eavesdropping!

16:21.778 --> 16:23.866
- Uh yeah, I'm a spy.
- Oh, right.

16:23.986 --> 16:27.288
And I also heard you raving about
how insane Katya's body was!

16:27.408 --> 16:29.958
Is! But not as insane as your mind!

16:30.078 --> 16:32.663
And her stilettos, and her
lingerie, and her big, fat,

16:32.783 --> 16:35.894
- vibrating robot vagina!
- And you're making my point for me!

16:36.014 --> 16:37.228
And-- how?

16:37.348 --> 16:41.033
It's easy not to bang your ex
if she's gone all frump-a-dump.

16:41.153 --> 16:46.235
The fact that Katya's still crazy hot makes it
all the more commendable I didn't bang her!

16:47.033 --> 16:50.216
I'm sorry, I think one of us must
have just suffered a massive stroke.

16:50.690 --> 16:53.771
- Oh, sorry. That's me, just making toast.
- Tooooast!

16:53.891 --> 16:57.326
- Yes, come and have some toast, David.
- Ugh, make him wash his hands first.

16:57.446 --> 16:59.060
Okay so, what do we do about
this?

16:59.180 --> 17:01.060
Well, since apparently we're
seeing other people now--

17:01.180 --> 17:02.320
- Oh?
- Not you.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.669
Not us, I meant sleepy Floyd
here.

17:04.789 --> 17:07.904
Right, shit. He knows we're with
the CIA, thanks to your fat mouth.

17:08.023 --> 17:11.796
Well it was your fat mouth all over
him that started this whole thing.

17:11.915 --> 17:15.789
Here, both of you. Get your fat
mouths around some hot, crispy toast.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.558
- Toooast!
- Damn it, David! Come and have some toast!

17:18.678 --> 17:20.319
It's obvious what we have to do
with him.

17:21.530 --> 17:22.528
Shoot him.

17:22.647 --> 17:24.836
- What?
- We're not shooting an MI5 agent.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.141
That's like shooting-- a cow.

17:27.261 --> 17:29.960
- How is that like--
- Lana, cows are our friends!

17:30.347 --> 17:33.551
- They may even be our best friends.
- We have to shoot him!

17:33.671 --> 17:37.468
If we don't, Downing Street will know the
CIA's bankrolling the Free Wales Army!

17:37.588 --> 17:39.059
"Fe godwn ni eto."

17:39.179 --> 17:42.219
David, come and have the bloody toast
or I'm throwing it in the bloody bin.

17:42.277 --> 17:45.230
- He does have a point, Lana.
- Yeah, I hate to waste good toast.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.939
We are not murdering an MI5
agent.

17:48.059 --> 17:52.305
- End of sentence, end of discussion.
- Are you sure there's nothing I can do

17:52.425 --> 17:54.631
- or say to change your mind, Lana?
- Very.

17:54.751 --> 17:58.137
- Well then could you hold the toast?
- Damn it!

17:58.257 --> 18:00.384
- Lloyd?
- Yeah, grabbed it while you were arguing.

18:00.504 --> 18:03.246
You never read Rosenberg's writings
on nonviolent communication?

18:03.366 --> 18:05.990
- Uh, no.
- Ah it really helped me and David.

18:06.110 --> 18:09.156
- Well, maybe we'll check that out.
- Uh, don't bother.

18:09.276 --> 18:12.807
Because before I shoot this MI5 asshole,
I'm gonna have to shoot the both of you.

18:12.927 --> 18:16.024
- Wait, what?
- Ah, don't worry. We'll always have--

18:17.434 --> 18:19.427
You think he was gonna say
"table"?

18:19.547 --> 18:21.987
- I think probably "Wales".
- Lloyd!

18:22.107 --> 18:24.794
Uh, so, that's a problem.

18:24.914 --> 18:28.424
- Nope, that is your problem.
- Uh, then may I have the gun please?

18:29.940 --> 18:32.534
- No.
- Oh my God, you are so immature.

18:32.654 --> 18:36.051
And you are so big.

18:38.062 --> 18:40.357
This is gonna be all Daniel
Boone.

18:42.290 --> 18:45.726
Alrighty, I think that's got it.
Nurse, would you close for me?

18:45.846 --> 18:48.778
- Uh, you already did that, Doctor.
- Oh right.

18:48.898 --> 18:50.338
Well then would you open for me?

18:50.458 --> 18:52.614
Goddamn it! Stop sexually harassing me!

18:52.879 --> 18:54.844
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

18:54.964 --> 18:58.726
Seriously. Come on, Tinker Toy,
let's go pound some homemade gin!

18:59.179 --> 19:03.096
So wait, how did we get to talking about
African American characters on <i>M*A S*H?</i>

19:03.216 --> 19:06.923
Well the <i>M*A S*H</i> connection
is obvious, perhaps even painfully so,

19:07.043 --> 19:11.686
but the African American thing?
Nope, no idea.

19:12.599 --> 19:14.213
But all things considered,

19:14.333 --> 19:16.450
that went about as well
as could be expected.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.233
Oh yeah? Which part?

19:18.586 --> 19:21.174
Leaving two Welsh terrorists
basically at large, or

19:21.294 --> 19:23.324
kidnapping an MI5 agent?

19:23.444 --> 19:25.624
- Well first of all, both.
- How--

19:25.744 --> 19:29.655
And second of all I was talking about
our argument and how now you realize

19:29.775 --> 19:34.118
- you overreacted about Katya.
- I-- Oh my God.

19:34.238 --> 19:37.315
- Admit it, Lana.
- I admit nothing.

19:37.627 --> 19:40.895
Although, I do think we both
learned that

19:41.015 --> 19:43.215
trust is important
and--

19:43.335 --> 19:44.911
I don't know, whatever!
Trust!

19:45.031 --> 19:47.422
- Is that the best I'm gonna get out of you?
- Yup.

19:47.542 --> 19:48.420
By far.

19:48.540 --> 19:51.169
Well then I accept your
non-apology.

19:51.289 --> 19:52.154
And?

19:52.274 --> 19:55.050
Oh my God, and I promise to
try not to get into

19:55.170 --> 19:57.348
compromising situations with other women.

19:57.468 --> 19:58.474
Best I can do.

19:58.594 --> 20:00.906
Well then let's just get this
limey bastard

20:01.026 --> 20:03.801
on that CIA plane and let Slater
worry about the blowback.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.809
You don't think they'll kill
him, do you?

20:05.929 --> 20:07.793
No, then they'd have to kill us.

20:08.702 --> 20:11.826
But, before we go back to the
States--

20:11.946 --> 20:13.687
Archer, I am not driving to Scotland

20:13.807 --> 20:15.757
with a kidnapped MI5
agent in the back

20:15.877 --> 20:19.125
- just to visit a stupid distillery.
- It's not stupid, Lana, it's--

20:19.462 --> 20:21.812
Glengoolie: for the best of
times.

20:22.037 --> 20:22.748
Although you're right.

20:22.868 --> 20:24.926
It's probably not the smartest
idea I've ever had.

20:25.046 --> 20:26.535
Hmm. What is?

20:26.655 --> 20:28.123
Oh my God, I'm glad you asked.

20:28.243 --> 20:31.314
Okay, so you put giant magnets
in the bumpers of all the cars

20:31.434 --> 20:34.183
so that every car repels every
other car

20:34.303 --> 20:36.385
so there would never
be any accidents!

20:36.505 --> 20:38.618
Except every single time
you're at a red light

20:38.738 --> 20:40.838
and a car comes and bounces you out into
the intersection

20:40.958 --> 20:43.118
and you get the shit T-boned out of ya.

20:45.804 --> 20:47.675
Thanks for the tampons.
