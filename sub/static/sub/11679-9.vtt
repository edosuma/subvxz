37:52.365 --> 37:54.560
Still leaves me free to shoot Carla.

37:55.602 --> 37:58.833
- Fi.
-Just sayin'.

37:58.905 --> 38:01.635
- Soon as I leave, they'll be on me. Can you?
- Yes, I can.

38:14.821 --> 38:17.381
[Michael Narrating]
Unlike cars...

38:17.457 --> 38:20.392
motorcycles don't have much
ofan aftermarket in stolen parts...

38:20.460 --> 38:24.362
so antitheft measures are outdated
and easy to get around.

38:24.431 --> 38:27.958
The steering lock on a smaller bike
breaks fairly easily.

38:28.034 --> 38:30.059
Then it's just a matter ofgetting away.

38:30.970 --> 38:33.268
- Go!
- [ Ti res Screech ]

38:37.477 --> 38:39.707
Hey!

38:40.947 --> 38:43.245
Hey! Look out!

38:47.587 --> 38:49.578
[ Michael Narrating ]
When you're tailed by multiple vehicles...

38:49.656 --> 38:51.886
you're at a disadvantage.

38:51.958 --> 38:53.926
- They can flankyou, take alternate routes...
- [ Horn Honki ng ]

38:53.993 --> 38:55.688
boxyou in.

38:55.762 --> 38:58.458
- It helps to have a team ofyour own.
- [ Horn Honks ]

39:03.136 --> 39:07.232
[ Michael Narrating] The electronic
stabilityprogram was originally developed...

39:07.307 --> 39:10.572
to help keep cars
from sliding on icy roads.

39:10.643 --> 39:13.305
But it's a great tool
for the precision driver.

39:13.380 --> 39:16.144
When you need to slide,
you can simply turn it off--

39:16.216 --> 39:18.946
[ Ti res Screechi ng ]

39:22.455 --> 39:25.083
and turn it on again
when you need to maneuver.

39:25.158 --> 39:26.989

40:25.518 --> 40:29.648
[ Michael Narrating]A semi has
about four feet ofclearance under it.

40:29.722 --> 40:33.021
Sliding beneath it on
a motorcycle is possible, but risky.

40:33.092 --> 40:35.720
Too low, and the pavement
will grindyou to a pulp.

40:35.795 --> 40:40.459
Too high, and any part ofyour body that hits
the trailer will no longer be part ofyour body.

41:07.126 --> 41:10.892
[ Cell Phone Ringing, Beeps ]

41:10.964 --> 41:13.831
Yeah, Sam. I ' m home.
Did you make it to the sni per's house?

41:13.900 --> 41:17.836
- Yeah. I got some news, Mikey. The sniper's dead.
- [ Chattering ]

41:17.904 --> 41:19.872
Dead? Whywould anyone--

41:19.939 --> 41:23.397
I don't know, but it's prettynasty.
Something is very. wrong.

41:23.476 --> 41:25.341
I don't get what's going on.

41:25.411 --> 41:28.437
They went to a lot of trouble
to put this guy in place.

41:28.515 --> 41:31.746
Slow down.J ust tell me.
What happened, Sam? How?

41:31.818 --> 41:34.412
Someone booby-trapped
his front door, Mike.

41:34.487 --> 41:36.614
- They blew him up.
