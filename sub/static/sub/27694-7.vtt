WEBVTT

01:42.227 --> 01:43.227
Here we are.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.348
First day of school all over again.

01:49.401 --> 01:50.812
I don't want you to go.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.364
I don't wanna go.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.244
But I'm doin' it anyway.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.212
What I'm gonna do without you?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.337
You're a tough guy. You'll be fine.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.634
You don't know that.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.847
Dad, come on. Let's get me moved in.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.396
You'll feel better once you're liftin'
something heavy.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.474
Boy, you got my number.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.606
Since I was two.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.943
Why didn't you call?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.203
I left you messages.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.588
Wayne, there was a man
at my reading, and he...

04:09.666 --> 04:11.783
- Where are the kids?
- In their rooms.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.243
Henry's on Nintendo.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.827
But there was this man at my reading.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.208
He was a black man with one eye.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.091
You saw a man with one eye?

04:21.178 --> 04:24.262
He was aggressive and rude, and...

04:25.223 --> 04:28.716
And he was asking
if I knew where Julie was now.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.848
Wayne, I think he was the guy
from back in '80.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.770
The one y'all were looking for.
The one who bought the dolls.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.146
You didn't get a name?
Any other way to find him?

04:38.236 --> 04:39.236
No...

04:39.988 --> 04:41.980
But he's out there,
and he's looking for her.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.987
I think he's the reason
that she ran away.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.122
Tom Purcell killed himself.

04:56.963 --> 04:57.963
What?

05:02.427 --> 05:03.427
How?

05:04.346 --> 05:05.507
Blew his brains out.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.514
After Roland and I went at him.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.434
Why'd you do that?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.002
Did you ever
think it was possible

05:18.026 --> 05:19.767
Tom didn't commit suicide?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.318
That was the ME's call.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.072
Man had plenty of reasons for doing
somethin' like that.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.909
The ME's report noted a swollen
contusion at the base of his skull,

05:28.995 --> 05:30.406
as if he'd been struck there.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.410
His skull was blown apart.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.459
The whole thing was one big contusion.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.253
We had an independent ME evaluate
the report.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.376
She said the gunshot wouldn't account

05:41.466 --> 05:43.583
for a particular bruise
and blood clot.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.842
You're suggestin' that somebody
brought him up there, unconscious,

05:48.932 --> 05:50.423
then did him in that way?

05:51.017 --> 05:54.101
In any case, it effectively
ended the second investigation.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.971
It's like 1980, isn't it?

05:57.566 --> 05:59.273
A sudden act of violence,

05:59.359 --> 06:00.600
a dead man,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.026
and the case is closed.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.658
Guess I never thought of it that way.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.074
It's like 1980 again.
They gonna hang it on a dead suspect.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.168
Suspect?

06:19.754 --> 06:20.915
That was us, man.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.007
We did that.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.458
Drove him to it.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.670
We didn't make that phone call.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.094
We did our job.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.388
If we hadn't, someone else would've.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.721
And you said it.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.518
They would've eaten him alive.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.856
We need to keep goin'.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.279
The missin' prints,
the man with one eye.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.778
- What Dan was sayin'.
- Take a fuckin' minute.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.410
A good man's dead
'cause we pushed him.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.868
Knowin' we didn't like him for it,
seein' how he was takin' it.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.244
You sure that's what happened?

06:58.877 --> 07:02.712
You figure Tom for a typist, write
a little three-line note like that?

07:02.797 --> 07:05.130
You ain't worked a case in 10 years.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.046
For fuck's sake, Purple.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.502
What do you think this is about?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.925
Why do you think I pulled you in here?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.433
To find a girl
and solve what happened.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.012
You don't think there's better
detectives around?

07:20.065 --> 07:22.648
Hey, we find the girl, great.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.812
We clear it, great.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.982
But how often's that happen?

07:27.530 --> 07:28.862
Ten-year-old case?

07:29.699 --> 07:32.191
This was me helpin' you
get your career back.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.153
You understand? It was a favor I did.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.163
'Cause I'm such a hard-luck case.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.499
Keep talkin'.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.540
Keep talkin'.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.497
I'm gonna put you back
on public information,

07:47.425 --> 07:49.758
or highway cleanup
for the next 10 years.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.720
How'd that be, huh?

08:01.189 --> 08:04.398
Roland, we need to keep goin'.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.088
If it wasn't Tom, don't let 'em...

08:07.112 --> 08:08.273
What do we got?

08:09.406 --> 08:13.275
You wanna go back lookin' for
any one-eyed black man in Arkansas?

08:14.244 --> 08:17.578
For what? 'Cause your wife saw one?

08:17.664 --> 08:18.700
It's somethin'.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.813
- And we got other evidence...
- Stop.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.996
Let go. This is our job.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.752
It ain't here to make you right.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.294
It's not the place
you work out your shit.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.514
You been drinkin' this mornin'?

08:43.857 --> 08:44.973
Fuck you, Wayne.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.776
Tom. What's doin'?

08:57.162 --> 08:58.949
I'm gettin' the fuck outta this place.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.327
Lucy's gone, and Julie's...

09:04.335 --> 09:05.335
Yeah, Julie's...

09:07.047 --> 09:08.413
You know, I thought if...

09:09.257 --> 09:10.714
If there was a chance, but...

09:11.885 --> 09:13.342
Y'all say she's dead.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.006
So I'm gettin' lost.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.466
What do you aim to do?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.473
Whatever it takes to stop feelin'.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.347
I mean, there's no point.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.480
Ain't nobody left
to feel anything for.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.196
I don't think those children'd want
you hurtin' yourself, Tom.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.573
No. No, they don't want
anything at all now.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.284
How could I get hurt worse?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.409
Ain't nothing could happen to me
that wouldn't be a relief.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.753
Where you goin'?

09:53.218 --> 09:54.218
Nowhere.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.758
I'm gonna need you to move your car.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.928
I don't feel quite right about that.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.101
Well, I ain't your orphan, Detective.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.022
Let me go out.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.404
I'm gonna give you my personal number
here, too.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.197
You get into trouble out there,

10:26.126 --> 10:27.537
you get jammed up,

10:28.545 --> 10:29.877
you use it.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.300
Hey.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.968
You don't need my help.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.846
But the day may come...

10:41.891 --> 10:44.053
And if it does, you got it.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.686
I make these
for Decoration Day.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.273
This one's for Tom.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.577
I don't understand
why he would do that now.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.705
He got through so much.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.202
So, what'd you want
to talk to me about?

11:53.755 --> 11:54.755
Really?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.878
Well, you being her best friend,

11:59.677 --> 12:02.511
did you ever know Lucy
to have an acquaintance,

12:03.598 --> 12:05.305
a black man with one eye?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.186
No.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.471
I mean...

12:12.398 --> 12:13.934
There were other men,

12:14.943 --> 12:16.559
but I never knew her to...

12:18.363 --> 12:21.447
Well, you know, not a black man.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.118
What are you drivin' at?

12:28.665 --> 12:29.951
It seems...

12:30.541 --> 12:35.502
It looks like this man with one eye
gave Julie a doll

12:35.588 --> 12:37.329
at Halloween in 1980.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.666
And there's some thought that
he might've been the one to take her.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.638
I... I don't know anythin' about that.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.226
Did you say Halloween?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.106
Hold on.

13:05.910 --> 13:06.910
All right.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.529
See now, these were developed

13:09.622 --> 13:12.035
after what happened.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.702
Look, I took their picture
when they came by.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.291
Do you know who these people are?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.050
The two ghosts?

13:25.346 --> 13:27.338
No, I don't think so, no.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.384
The farmer back then,

13:32.729 --> 13:35.187
he said he saw
a mixed-race couple a few times

13:35.273 --> 13:37.890
near his house,
on the other side of Devil's Den.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.234
Could I borrow this picture?

13:42.238 --> 13:45.026
No, I... I'd rather that you didn't.
That's mine.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.094
Just to make a copy. I could bring it
right back to you.

13:47.118 --> 13:50.111
I would rather that you didn't.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.936
Hey.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.515
If I let you borrow this picture,
you'll come back?

14:20.610 --> 14:21.610
Tomorrow?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.486
Yes, I will. Tomorrow.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.619
Do you ever think
about moving to town?

14:37.835 --> 14:38.835
Why would I?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.167
Somebody's got to stay.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.673
Somebody's got to remember.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.684
<i>There was talk initially</i>

14:55.770 --> 14:58.387
<i>that your wife was writing a sequel
to her first book.</i>

14:59.440 --> 15:01.727
She eventually decided not to do that.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.355
She had other stories to write.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.655
Were you sharing information with her
during the second investigation?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.553
Just the way a husband and wife talk.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.988
Tell each other what's...

15:16.791 --> 15:18.748
- Hey, Henry.
- How you doin', Mr. West?

15:19.377 --> 15:21.585
...what's goin' on in their lives.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.089
Did any of her research
suggest a larger conspiracy?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.174
Like a cover-up?

15:28.678 --> 15:29.839
I don't think so.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.302
Do you have evidence
of somethin' like that?

15:44.527 --> 15:47.235
- What do you got?
- Car's in the lot.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.404
A '78 Mercury Capri.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.824
Missouri, Echo-Echo-Oscar-6-7-9.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.989
- You talk to the clerk?
- Mmm-mmm.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.954
Paid up through the week.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.037
Anybody come around
askin' about this guy?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.000
Just you two.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.220
Stay here.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.392
Dan?

16:19.770 --> 16:21.762
You hear anything? See somethin'?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.519
No. Nothin'.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.770
You work last night?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.945
Who else mans the desk?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.902
Uh, I worked the last two nights.
Wife covers.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.368
Can talk to her if you want.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.814
I think she would've mentioned it.

16:42.793 --> 16:46.457
Shows up,
says Lucy was murdered.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.673
Seemed to clear Tom.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.925
Actin' real paranoid.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.347
"There's people out there don't want
you to know what I know."

16:58.684 --> 17:00.471
So he's right to be paranoid.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.137
Unless he just took off.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.065
I can't see him leavin' the car,
stagin' that scene.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.487
We fuckin' lost him. We're burned.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.794
<i>After being confronted with
new evidence alleging his guilt,</i>

17:26.878 --> 17:28.836
<i>and his children's disappearance
and death,</i>

17:28.923 --> 17:32.041
<i>Tom Purcell committed suicide
at the scene of the original crime.</i>

17:32.134 --> 17:35.593
<i>He left a note which could be
interpreted as a confession.</i>

17:35.680 --> 17:37.157
<i>But, sir...</i>

17:37.181 --> 17:40.765
<i>We are at this time willing to
overturn the absentia conviction</i>

17:40.851 --> 17:42.308
<i>of Brett Woodard.</i>

17:42.395 --> 17:43.395
<i>Sir...</i>

17:48.067 --> 17:49.478
I saw that live.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.403
You weren't satisfied with
the AG's conclusions, were you?

17:55.700 --> 17:56.700
No.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.989
But I've never been satisfied
with any part of the case.

18:09.839 --> 18:10.839
Good morning.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.757
You trying to impress me?

18:14.218 --> 18:16.426
I'm only doin' my half.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.636
I ain't bein' funny.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.214
You gotta do your own.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.970
Yeah, no complaints.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.972
I'm just happy
you're not looking for a mother.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.605
Workin' on somethin'?

18:39.702 --> 18:41.694
Yeah, just playing around.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.199
'Bout the case?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.080
What kind of thing you writin'?

18:47.501 --> 18:50.118
An article maybe.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.419
I'm not sure.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.667
For the paper?

18:54.508 --> 18:56.215
Maybe a magazine.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.176
I don't know.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.472
You ever read <i>In Cold Blood?</i>

19:03.601 --> 19:05.513
Is that Batman or the Silver Surfer?

19:06.937 --> 19:08.644
I have my seniors read it.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.145
I'm thinking
about writing about the crime,

19:12.985 --> 19:14.977
but more about the community.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.399
Writing's a pain.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.232
You scratched out
half of what you wrote.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.318
Why you bother?

19:25.748 --> 19:27.489
I feel I have a voice.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.540
You think I went to college
for four years

19:32.630 --> 19:33.916
to be like my mother?

19:41.555 --> 19:42.921
You should write about it.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.308
Really?

19:46.060 --> 19:48.177
Well, you're a hunk of surprises.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.138
It's not like the 6:00 news
is gonna do it.

19:52.149 --> 19:55.108
Somebody ought to point out what
they're sayin' doesn't fuckin' hold.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.986
You think it's a conflict of interest?

20:01.075 --> 20:04.068
Us doing this,
and me writing about that?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.657
People ought to know they closed it
'cause they wanted it closed.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.872
It's not solved.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.544
Wouldn't that hurt you? Your job?

20:20.302 --> 20:21.964
I don't want you getting in trouble.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.512
Fuck 'em.
They don't wanna do it right,

20:24.598 --> 20:25.930
it's not a job worth havin'.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.766
Could tell you all kinds of shit.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.231
Thought you were
just gonna do your half.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.028
Me and my goddamn work ethic.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.734
Did you know
that even after Tom died,

20:44.827 --> 20:46.784
there was a man going around
looking for Julie,

20:46.871 --> 20:48.362
asking about her?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.117
A black man?

20:51.792 --> 20:52.792
No.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.826
This man was missing an eye.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.375
One witness said
he identified himself as "Watts."

21:00.092 --> 21:01.092
Watts?

21:01.469 --> 21:03.882
Our thought was
this man was a procurer.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.509
Possibly the person
Julie ran away from.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.601
Procurer?

21:11.395 --> 21:12.395
For what?

21:17.234 --> 21:19.191
They came to me, you know.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.353
I said fuck off.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.774
I told your daddy
he shouldn't be doin' this.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.108
Could be dangerous.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.284
Dangerous how?

21:34.210 --> 21:37.123
Look, I ain't tryin'
to rat on the man or nothin'.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.039
But you know what he does at night?

21:40.132 --> 21:43.000
I know last week he ended up on
Shoepick Lane, 3:00 in the mornin'.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.709
Couldn't say what he was doin' there.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.969
He sits in your mama's old office
goin' through her book, her old files.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.845
Yeah, I got that impression.

21:50.935 --> 21:54.303
Well, he's doin' it with a loaded gun
on his desk.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.808
Keeps it near at hand.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.694
Dolls are used as signifiers
in the human-trafficking underground.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.401
Like this blue spiral,
it's code for pedophiles.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.363
In 2012,

22:13.457 --> 22:15.697
two former Louisiana state police
stopped a serial killer

22:15.751 --> 22:18.585
associated with
some kind of pedophile ring.

22:18.671 --> 22:22.335
Despite evidence of accomplices,
the case never went wider.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.334
Think I read about that.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.384
So what are you sayin'?

22:31.976 --> 22:32.976
Hmm?

22:33.936 --> 22:37.475
I think at this point,
I deserve an explanation, miss.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.474
What do you say happened?

22:41.402 --> 22:44.110
Never a moment of doubt
in that man, right?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.443
Watchin' him like this, I...

22:49.326 --> 22:51.488
I can't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.076
He needs somebody stayin' with him,

22:56.542 --> 22:58.033
watchin' out for him.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.088
I think what happened
to the Purcell children

23:03.173 --> 23:04.584
was connected to a similar group.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.047
I think one or both of their parents
sold them off.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.670
Probably with the cousin's help.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.884
That's why they're all gone.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.765
Vanished, killed, kept silent.

23:17.980 --> 23:18.980
Hmm.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.473
These groups, they take runaways.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.985
Kids in orphanages.
Outright kidnapping.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.780
And wider investigations
are consistently curtailed.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.150
In both
the Louisiana and Nebraska cases,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.952
high-level politicians and businessmen
were implicated.

23:35.539 --> 23:38.327
People with the power
to make these things go away.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.335
You were transferred off Major Crimes
after the '80 investigation.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.038
In 1990, you left the force.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.425
You saw nothing that suggested
obfuscation from higher quarters?

23:49.970 --> 23:51.381
No evidence ignored?

23:51.931 --> 23:53.718
No forced conclusions?

23:56.644 --> 23:58.010
Bein' police...

23:59.730 --> 24:01.312
There's no certainty.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.899
A lot of the time,
there's no clarity at all.

24:06.487 --> 24:09.150
You just do your best,

24:10.449 --> 24:12.065
and learn to live with ambiguity.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.996
I have to say I'm disappointed.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.005
I had most wanted to talk to you
because your record indicated

24:31.095 --> 24:33.007
you never went along with
the official version.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.930
I've been hoping
you'd provide a missing piece.

24:37.851 --> 24:38.851
Young lady...

24:40.020 --> 24:41.727
My whole brain's
a bunch of missin' pieces.

24:47.945 --> 24:48.945
I'm sorry.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.072
This is what you've been leadin' to
the whole time.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.243
I don't got answers for you, miss.

24:58.372 --> 24:59.988
I wish I did, but I don't.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.331
Mr. Hays, please...

25:03.127 --> 25:05.961
Can we consider this, what I've said?

25:06.046 --> 25:07.127
No, ma'am.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.048
You'll excuse me.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.251
I'm tired
of walkin' through the graveyard.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.255
The story's over for me.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.611
Hey.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.106
"Watts," she said.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.986
The one-eyed man.

25:36.744 --> 25:37.744
You heard that?

25:39.580 --> 25:41.492
Write it down before I forget. Watts.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.741
I'm sorry, man,

25:45.878 --> 25:48.165
but you think your wife
would want this for you?

25:49.465 --> 25:50.797
What's happenin' with you?

25:56.388 --> 25:58.004
She wants me to finish it.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.098
How's that?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.520
Watts.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.518
Don't forget, 'cause I will.

26:20.496 --> 26:25.582
Detective Hays, Nevada Bell faxed
the phone records that you requested.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.079
Three weeks in '88.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.167
Thank you, Officer.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.693
Okay, kids, let's get in the car.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.620
- What?
- Your dad was supposed to watch you.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.993
- It's a school night.
- Come on, shoes on!

27:49.668 --> 27:51.159
Need y'all to take a ride with me.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.588
Yeah, hi.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.919
Lieutenant Roland West.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.594
Arkansas State Police, badge 4-5-7.

28:03.682 --> 28:07.266
I need flight records,
private airfields, passenger records.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.056
Every flight
into McCarran International.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.347
These dates, uh...

28:14.109 --> 28:15.109
Yeah, I'll hold.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.828
I was wondering,
when Lucy worked here,

28:27.915 --> 28:30.749
she get a lot of visitors? Men?

28:31.418 --> 28:32.659
Yeah, you could say that.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.332
Most guys came in here
tried to chat her up.

28:35.589 --> 28:36.589
Good for business.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.249
I was curious,

28:39.343 --> 28:41.676
you ever see a couple in here
talking to her?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.011
Black man, white woman.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.885
I don't think so, not that I recall.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.683
How about just a black man?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.394
He'd have been missing an eye.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.229
White, no pupil.

28:54.316 --> 28:55.316
Well, you know, that...

28:56.318 --> 28:58.310
I mean,
it just occurred to me.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.403
I never seen her with him,

29:00.489 --> 29:03.482
but I remember
her brother or cousin and, um...

29:03.575 --> 29:05.862
- Dan O'Brien.
- Dan, yeah.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.907
Now him, I seen once
talkin' to a fella like that.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.073
Black fella missing an eye.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.273
Oh, great. 'Cause we don't see
each other enough.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.650
- You need to look at this.
- Why?

29:43.949 --> 29:45.440
I got the whole thing.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.237
That phone number.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.788
Called eight times in one night.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.500
Less than two days before Lucy OD'ed.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.954
Her room, unpaid on her bill...

30:00.716 --> 30:03.174
- Okay.
- ...belongs to this address.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.172
Place is owned by the Ozark Trust.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.547
Dug through, uh,
a bunch of property records.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.137
It's the Hoyt Corporation.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.145
Security.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.596
Harris James' personal line.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.025
Huh.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.439
This is the passenger manifest
on the FAC out of Tulsa.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.069
First-class passenger to Vegas.

30:29.286 --> 30:30.493
This is it.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.872
Harris James flew to Vegas the day
before Lucy died.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.783
Came back the day after.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.711
So you wanna bring this to Blevins?

30:40.797 --> 30:42.038
No, God damn it.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.834
What would they do,
except shove it in a file

30:45.927 --> 30:47.634
and stuff me in another basement?

30:49.014 --> 30:51.256
They planted the evidence
at Woodard's, man.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.934
Probably took the fingerprints
from the toys in the woods

30:55.020 --> 30:56.181
before he left the force.

30:57.731 --> 30:58.731
Roland.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.143
So what do you think we can
do with this, Wayne?

31:03.236 --> 31:05.899
We can go and ask him
what the fuck he was doin' in Vegas.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.901
And we ask hard, man, like we used to.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.242
Have to do with Hoyt, don't you think?

31:11.328 --> 31:12.910
Harris gettin' that job?

31:13.955 --> 31:16.914
If it had to do with his boss,
we can get him to roll.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.503
No. We can't.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.099
We can bring it in.
That's all there is.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.344
We can't do somethin' like that.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.555
He doesn't talk,
we'd be fucked forever.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.065
And I get what you did here.
It's good.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.690
But all we can do is make our case.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.455
I'm thinkin' about Tom.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.379
Thinkin' about that note.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.085
You see him
wantin' to be with Lucy again?

32:10.554 --> 32:11.715
You see him typin' it?

32:14.266 --> 32:15.928
We gotta do this for Tom.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.765
And what if James won't talk?

32:21.690 --> 32:23.431
We get enough on him, he'll break.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.477
Get him out to that barn...

32:28.738 --> 32:29.945
He'll break.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.201
If we...

32:37.289 --> 32:39.076
If you feel like you let Tom down,

32:39.958 --> 32:41.574
this is how you make it right, Roland.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.751
Don't let it slide.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.000
Don't let them put this on him.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.091
This is how we do right by Tom.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.794
You can stop sayin' that now.

32:53.722 --> 32:54.883
I'm not simple.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.147
1955 to 1985.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.519
I was kitchen maid, then housekeeper.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.531
Long time with the Hoyts.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.569
Why y'all still police at your age?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.238
Just didn't want to retire.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.163
Couldn't imagine
what I'd do with myself.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.335
And we ain't good for much else.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.163
Hmm.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.002
So, how can I help you?

33:31.092 --> 33:32.708
What was it, about the Hoyts?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.344
We're lookin' at some old stuff, uh...

33:36.264 --> 33:38.802
You ever know a man
named Harris James,

33:38.892 --> 33:40.258
worked for the Hoyts?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.431
Seen him more than known him.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.388
He came on in my last years there.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.599
He ran security for Mr. Hoyt.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.893
Lot of tragedy in that family.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.904
Wondered what
you could tell us about 'em.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.733
That family had no luck.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.067
Except in business.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.162
I helped raise Miss Isabel.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.531
Isabel, the daughter.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.159
She had her own family, right?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.331
Like I said, no luck.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.626
Her husband and little girl passed on.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.219
Bad wreck, '77.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.389
She was

34:20.308 --> 34:21.308
troubled.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.056
Never left the estate.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.188
Then one night,

34:29.150 --> 34:31.016
she took a car out,

34:32.027 --> 34:33.690
put it through a guardrail.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.610
Caused a big accident.

34:37.951 --> 34:41.239
After that, Mr. June watched over her.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.580
He'd drive her... Whatever she needed.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.123
Mr. June? Who was that?

34:48.545 --> 34:51.788
He was pretty close with Mr. Hoyt.
Black gentleman.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.246
Stayed in the main house.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.378
Basement level.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.211
Whole part of the house
for Miss Isabel,

34:58.930 --> 35:02.048
but Mr. June the only one
could go down there.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.677
You know his first name, Mr. June?

35:07.188 --> 35:09.931
I'm not sure was "June,"
his last name.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.641
We just called him Mr. June.

35:12.611 --> 35:16.025
There wasn't much talk
between him and us others.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.236
You know if he's still around?

35:19.326 --> 35:20.442
Mmm-mmm.

35:20.535 --> 35:24.028
How 'bout a description?
Anything you noticed about him?

35:24.748 --> 35:25.989
Just his eye.

35:26.916 --> 35:31.035
His left eye was white.
Dead, you know.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.544
How about a man named Watts?

35:38.470 --> 35:41.679
Can I go swimming down by the river
with Lisa?

35:43.099 --> 35:44.099
Becca.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.767
You're all packed?

35:47.270 --> 35:49.262
No, man, shh.

35:49.356 --> 35:50.938
Hey, just look at me.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.890
I'm drivin' her to school.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.192
Later, yeah. Sure.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.355
Why'd you leave?

36:00.742 --> 36:02.324
Around '81,

36:02.410 --> 36:04.868
they started restricting
where we could go.

36:05.872 --> 36:09.582
Had to stay in the kitchen or foyer,
in the main house.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.499
Miss Isabel,

36:11.586 --> 36:13.999
I don't know what was happenin',

36:14.089 --> 36:17.298
but I think she was gettin' worse.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.634
Where you at?

36:25.642 --> 36:26.928
Are you all right?

36:27.644 --> 36:29.226
I shouldn't have said that.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.684
About Tom. I'm sorry.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.184
What about Tom?

36:36.986 --> 36:39.103
Gettin' you to go after Harris,

36:39.989 --> 36:41.696
tryin' to make you do what I wanted.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.699
I shouldn't have done that.

36:45.954 --> 36:46.954
I just...

36:48.665 --> 36:49.951
What happened, I...

36:51.167 --> 36:54.285
I didn't... I didn't realize
how different we were.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.211
I hope we can move past it.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.878
We're past it, bro.

37:05.974 --> 37:06.974
Come on.

37:41.634 --> 37:42.634
That's him.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.297
Lieutenant West.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.500
You doin' traffic stops now?

39:05.969 --> 39:07.631
Step out of the car, sir.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.133
Everything all right?

39:11.057 --> 39:12.923
You got a dark look, Lieutenant.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.350
I need you
to step out of the car, sir.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.934
Yes... Yes, sir, Lieutenant, uh...

39:19.774 --> 39:21.310
What seems to be the problem? I...

39:21.401 --> 39:22.937
Refusin' to comply?

39:23.403 --> 39:25.144
You're refusin' to comply.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.230
Wait, just... Just what are we doin'
here?

39:28.324 --> 39:30.156
You need to talk or somethin',

39:30.243 --> 39:31.905
we can always do that at the office.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.236
Yours or mine.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.912
You seem real upset, sir.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.165
Oh.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.992
You reachin' for this?

39:40.086 --> 39:41.202
No, sir, I was not.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.628
Step out of the car!

39:42.714 --> 39:44.455
I'd like to know what's goin' on.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.193
- You both seem real angry.
- Get out, motherfucker!

39:46.217 --> 39:48.675
- No, I'm not...
- Come on!

39:49.804 --> 39:51.884
Come on! Son of a bitch!

39:55.476 --> 39:57.263
Get out, motherfucker!

40:16.581 --> 40:17.581
What, then?

40:18.541 --> 40:19.622
Get on with it.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.617
You don't want to be givin' orders.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.753
Lucy called the Hoyt Corporation.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.001
Eight times, the day before she OD'ed.

40:28.301 --> 40:31.465
We got you comin' into Vegas
for two days when she died.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.055
You put that fuckin' backpack
and dress in Woodard's way back,

40:35.141 --> 40:36.177
didn't you?

40:36.935 --> 40:40.394
And you were goin' around
re-interviewin' witnesses,

40:40.480 --> 40:42.346
see if anybody saw anything?

40:45.652 --> 40:47.518
You gave Lucy a hot-shot.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.603
Well, that's some wild storytellin'.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.155
I do not know
what you're talkin' about.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.194
Oh, God!

40:56.287 --> 40:58.324
What happened to the kids in '80?

40:58.873 --> 41:00.956
You tell me. You're the detectives.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.251
God damn it!

41:04.295 --> 41:05.502
Stop hittin' me!

41:05.588 --> 41:06.588
Fuck!

41:07.256 --> 41:08.747
Lucy wanted what?

41:08.841 --> 41:09.841
Money?

41:11.219 --> 41:13.586
What'd she say, when you flew
out there and killed her?

41:15.223 --> 41:17.590
Dan O'Brien said somethin' about, uh,

41:18.977 --> 41:21.060
people who don't renegotiate.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.058
You's who he was worried about, huh?

41:24.691 --> 41:26.023
You found him.

41:26.109 --> 41:28.021
Let me tell you both somethin'.

41:28.528 --> 41:31.862
Them two, the mother and her cousin...

41:33.282 --> 41:34.989
They ain't people you should worry on.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.317
Well, I mean, what's this for?

41:36.411 --> 41:38.528
Y'all can't give a shit
about that trash.

41:39.372 --> 41:40.704
My friend's dead.

41:41.666 --> 41:42.747
The kids.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.325
I got kids.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.502
I wouldn't ever... I would...

41:47.130 --> 41:49.588
I would never hurt a child. Oh, God.

41:50.842 --> 41:54.836
Somethin's wrong inside.
You busted me up, man.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.837
Tell us what happened.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.182
The whole story.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.395
The kids were meetin' somebody
in the woods, regular.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.143
That's who took 'em.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.938
Maybe the mother's involved,
maybe O'Brien.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.646
But you planted the evidence in '80.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.115
And you took the fingerprints
outta evidence.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.326
All for Hoyt, we figure.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.122
He got somethin' for kids?

42:24.834 --> 42:26.354
Maybe there was
a group of 'em.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.331
Friends of his.

42:29.422 --> 42:30.788
People into kids.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.462
You two are really up shit creek, huh?

42:39.515 --> 42:40.515
Oh, God.

42:41.809 --> 42:42.809
I'm hurt.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.646
I...

42:46.731 --> 42:48.597
I can only tell you what I know.

42:50.276 --> 42:51.276
But...

42:52.236 --> 42:54.523
I gotta know I'm walkin' outta here.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.606
Well, you'll be alive, any rate.

43:00.828 --> 43:01.944
Take these...

43:02.038 --> 43:04.280
I can't feel my fuckin' hands, man.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.868
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

43:11.881 --> 43:14.214
You kicked my ribs to pieces, man.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.259
I feel it stabbin' my lung.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.804
Oh, God. Jesus.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.726
How hard you kick him?

43:42.620 --> 43:44.077
Hey!

44:34.964 --> 44:37.047
- Listen...
- Fuck you.

44:37.133 --> 44:38.624
Fuck you for this.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.129
He didn't give us a choice.

44:41.679 --> 44:42.886
And I was right.

44:42.972 --> 44:44.588
You seen it. He knew.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.595
Nah, you were talkin' shit about Tom.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.682
Gettin' me to go along with this.
Gettin' your way.

44:50.771 --> 44:53.764
Hold up. You're a grown-ass man.
I didn't force you to do anything.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.396
I just killed a man, you dumb asshole!

44:56.485 --> 45:00.479
Now it's all gone! Done!
Whatever he knew, gone!

45:00.573 --> 45:03.111
- You fucked my life!
- We did it, Roland!

45:03.201 --> 45:06.694
You manipulative, egotistical,
uppity fuckin'...

45:08.456 --> 45:09.456
What?

45:10.541 --> 45:11.541
Huh?

45:11.876 --> 45:12.992
What you gonna say?

45:14.045 --> 45:17.038
Guess what word's
runnin' through my mind right now.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.007
Say it, then.

45:20.927 --> 45:22.259
Say it, motherfucker.

45:24.096 --> 45:25.096
No.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.715
I just want you to know
I'm thinkin' it.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.484
Harris was Highway Patrol,

45:43.574 --> 45:45.907
Zone 4, back in '77.

45:47.203 --> 45:50.571
That puts him in the area
where the maid said

45:50.665 --> 45:52.622
that Hoyt's daughter had her accident.

45:53.626 --> 45:54.867
That could've been the start...

45:55.711 --> 45:58.328
Him helpin' them, workin' for 'em.

45:59.799 --> 46:02.291
The black man. "Mr. June."

46:03.594 --> 46:07.258
Amelia said O'Brien met with him,
that bar Lucy worked.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.806
They had some kind of arrangement.

46:11.227 --> 46:15.187
You know, I always figured
you would've kept after this

46:15.273 --> 46:16.559
in some way.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.057
Nah.

46:19.068 --> 46:20.400
I told you,

46:20.486 --> 46:21.567
let it go.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.947
Amelia and me made a deal.

46:29.412 --> 46:30.412
Yeah.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.447
She was a good investigator, huh?

46:39.922 --> 46:41.879
She told me somethin' the other day.

46:43.426 --> 46:44.837
She was talkin' to me.

46:46.929 --> 46:47.929
She said, uh...

46:50.558 --> 46:52.550
She said that I hadn't known myself,

46:53.394 --> 46:54.394
and that...

46:55.271 --> 46:57.137
That it made me harden my heart.

47:00.776 --> 47:02.312
Amelia told you this?

47:08.326 --> 47:09.446
She was sittin' right there.

47:16.417 --> 47:19.535
She always knew how to cut into me
if she wanted to.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.878
Son of a bitch is back.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.520
Humor a crazy old man, Detective West.

47:56.749 --> 47:57.749
Hey.

47:58.959 --> 48:00.370
You lookin' for me?

48:02.296 --> 48:03.296
Come out there.

48:04.757 --> 48:05.757
Hey...

48:11.722 --> 48:13.588
- You get it?
- Yeah.

48:20.231 --> 48:23.099
Could just be somebody's ex-boyfriend
watchin' the house.

50:17.765 --> 50:18.765
Wayne?

50:23.103 --> 50:24.103
Wayne.

50:30.903 --> 50:32.110
What are you doing?

50:47.044 --> 50:48.160
What is this?

50:52.841 --> 50:54.423
Where have you been?

51:04.853 --> 51:06.560
I can't talk about this.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.032
In the morning...

51:19.743 --> 51:20.984
We have to talk.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.454
Will you talk to me in the morning?

52:01.035 --> 52:02.492
We haven't been honest.

52:04.747 --> 52:06.579
What's going on, what we're doing.

52:08.917 --> 52:10.499
No. I know.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.504
Maybe we could turn it around.

52:17.468 --> 52:18.629
If I tell you...

52:21.722 --> 52:24.055
Things you're better off not knowin'.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.351
Not about you, there's not.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.937
With you, I need to know everything.

52:34.109 --> 52:36.396
I'd be a son of a bitch
if I did that to you.

52:42.117 --> 52:44.404
I'm sorry, uh,
it could be Roland or somethin'.

52:45.579 --> 52:46.579
Could be big.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.114
Please. Hold on.

52:55.631 --> 52:57.839
- Hello?
<i>- Detective Hays?</i>

52:58.425 --> 53:00.291
<i>- Wayne Hays?</i>
- Yes.

53:01.637 --> 53:02.923
<i>Do you know who this is?</i>

53:03.597 --> 53:04.597
No.

53:05.641 --> 53:06.848
<i>Edward Hoyt.</i>

53:09.812 --> 53:12.395
<i>I think we may have
some things to discuss.</i>

53:14.108 --> 53:15.108
How's that?

53:16.318 --> 53:17.434
<i>Harris James.</i>

53:18.862 --> 53:21.354
<i>I'd like to discuss
the events of last night.</i>

53:22.700 --> 53:24.487
<i>As I understand them.</i>

53:26.537 --> 53:28.449
<i>I could come inside, if you like.</i>

53:40.509 --> 53:42.466
<i>I'd be pleased to meet your family.</i>

53:43.387 --> 53:45.253
<i>Your wife, the writer?</i>

53:45.723 --> 53:47.214
<i>Little Henry and Rebecca.</i>

53:48.976 --> 53:51.059
<i>It's lucky, havin' a family.</i>

53:55.399 --> 53:56.399
No.

53:57.735 --> 54:00.318
<i>Then maybe you'd like
to come out and talk to me.</i>

54:01.780 --> 54:04.944
<i>My preference, you understand,
is to keep this between us.</i>

54:07.536 --> 54:08.652
<i>For the moment.</i>

54:09.163 --> 54:10.699
How 'bout a little later?

54:12.499 --> 54:13.740
<i>You may not realize this,</i>

54:13.834 --> 54:16.542
<i>but I've been pretty damn patient
with you already.</i>

54:16.628 --> 54:19.962
<i>Perhaps I should take my information
to the prosecutor's office.</i>

54:20.591 --> 54:21.672
<i>Or like I say,</i>

54:22.342 --> 54:23.833
<i>happy to talk inside.</i>

54:25.763 --> 54:26.763
No.

54:27.598 --> 54:28.964
I'll be out in five.

54:37.441 --> 54:38.441
What?

54:44.656 --> 54:45.656
Just, uh...

54:48.285 --> 54:50.743
I'm sorry. It's one last time.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.071
Trust me, all right?

54:53.165 --> 54:55.157
One more time. That's it.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.116
Then we talk,
then I tell you everything.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.252
Right now, um...

55:00.672 --> 55:01.753
Listen.

55:02.174 --> 55:03.460
You gotta just trust me.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.468
One last time.

55:13.477 --> 55:14.638
This is it.
