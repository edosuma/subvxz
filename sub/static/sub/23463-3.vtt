00:30.860 --> 00:32.450
What is a family?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.930
Is it the tie of flesh and blood?

00:35.380 --> 00:39.850
Our facial features and the
traits we inherit and pass on?

00:39.900 --> 00:42.450
Or is it the rhythm

00:42.500 --> 00:44.180
our hearts beat out...

00:45.220 --> 00:48.050
.. marking out the days we share?

00:48.100 --> 00:49.170
Good morning.

00:49.220 --> 00:52.370
Family is our touchstone, our haven.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.820
Family is the place where life begins.

00:56.540 --> 00:57.940
Thank you.

01:09.860 --> 01:12.090
Magda's worked out
rather well, hasn't she?

01:12.140 --> 01:15.090
Yes, don't know what you
were worrying about, Patrick.

01:15.140 --> 01:16.930
Me!

01:16.980 --> 01:19.770
Now what are you going to
do with your evening off?

01:19.820 --> 01:22.250
I have promised to help
Timothy with his French.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.850
And in return I'm going to teach her to
bat an absolutely stinging square-cut!

01:26.900 --> 01:28.850
I believe it's some kind of sport.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.890
Timothy, Magda doesn't
want to play cricket!

01:31.940 --> 01:33.970
You should be out socialising.

01:34.020 --> 01:37.210
Why don't you go and say hello
to the girls at Nonnatus House?

01:37.260 --> 01:39.250
They always seem so busy.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.690
And I have my best friends here already.

01:41.740 --> 01:45.290
Don't I? Say, "Goodbye, Mummy".

01:45.340 --> 01:46.780
Bye, darling.

01:51.340 --> 01:52.940
Is everything all right, lass?

01:56.540 --> 01:59.810
Gordon's on nights at the paint factory.

01:59.860 --> 02:03.860
I'm on my own a lot in the day,
I just... get a bit behind.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.210
Why don't I just help you
to do a bit of a tidy-up

02:08.259 --> 02:10.530
before your husband gets home?

02:10.580 --> 02:13.250
Hey, Mrs Lunt.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.570
Oh!

02:14.620 --> 02:17.330
I made that myself, you know.

02:17.380 --> 02:22.690
I sew all sorts and I knit, I
used to make all the kids' clothes.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.100
It's very nice.

02:25.220 --> 02:28.530
Now I'm going to book you
into the maternity home

02:28.580 --> 02:32.300
so that you don't have to
worry about anything but Baby.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.450
You must be Mr Lunt.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.010
I was just saying to your wife that,
all things considered, I think

02:39.060 --> 02:41.290
it best she give birth
in the maternity home.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.570
I'm sorry but that's not happening.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.610
Mr Lunt, in my view,

02:45.660 --> 02:50.250
everything is just a bit too
much for your wife at the moment.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.140
She's going nowhere.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.290
We could do a jumble sale.

02:59.340 --> 03:01.610
People love rooting around
in other people's rubbish.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.170
A jumble sale?!

03:03.220 --> 03:06.930
Why can't we just go to Margate
like normal people at Whitsun?

03:06.980 --> 03:10.370
Cos I promised the WVS that
I'd organise something,

03:10.420 --> 03:11.970
and I'm a woman of my word.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.810
Ere, ere, look at this.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.660
Miss United Kingdom, Diane
Westbury, look what she's up to.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.450
We could do our own beauty
competition Whit Monday.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.090
Miss Poplar 1963.

03:24.140 --> 03:26.730
They're all the rage now,
you know, beauty contests.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.450
- I don't think so.
- Well why not? We could do it together.

03:29.500 --> 03:34.050
I could sell tickets, we'd make
a packet for the CDC and the WVS.

03:34.100 --> 03:37.170
You just want to see all the
local girls in their smalls!

03:37.220 --> 03:41.410
No, I just want to see my lovely
lady wife put her talents to

03:41.460 --> 03:44.220
something better than
a blinking jumble sale.

03:45.380 --> 03:48.260
Well, when you put it like that.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.530
I suppose we'd see the girls
in their evening dresses.

03:51.580 --> 03:52.900
Swimwear...

03:55.020 --> 03:58.370
We could have a home-made dress category!

03:58.420 --> 04:00.820
I'll order new stock, pronto.

04:02.820 --> 04:06.050
Hello, Mrs Turner! Lovely day.

04:06.100 --> 04:09.450
Isn't it just? I was
hoping to have a word.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.450
You might've seen our new
Hungarian au pair, Magda?

04:12.500 --> 04:16.089
Ooh, yes, ever so glamorous
isn't she? How's she getting on?

04:16.140 --> 04:19.209
Wonderfully. I don't know
how we managed without her.

04:19.260 --> 04:23.050
The problem is she doesn't
know anyone here apart from us.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.530
Her family are stuck in Hungary and
she hasn't seen them for years.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.930
I'd love it if she could make
some friends and settle in a bit.

04:29.980 --> 04:33.130
How about sending her
along to Keep Fit tonight?

04:33.180 --> 04:36.740
We always have a giggle,
she'll be one of us in no time.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.170
Miss Poplar 1963.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.210
Now we've just got to find entrants.

04:45.260 --> 04:48.330
And sell tickets. Hmm.
I'll put the word out.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.450
Do you really think we
can pull this off, Fred?

04:50.500 --> 04:54.780
If we don't raise at least 100
quid, I will wear that myself.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.010
Can everyone change into their
leotards, please, we're running late.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.930
Magda, isn't it? I'm
really glad you could come.

05:08.980 --> 05:12.170
- I'm Valerie.
- Thank you, it is lovely to be here.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.210
I hear you've just come
from Paris? How wonderful!

05:15.260 --> 05:16.730
I think I prefer London.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.650
We're not quite the City of
Light, but we try our best.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.450
Sorry I'm late. I have been busy planning!

05:22.500 --> 05:27.450
Fred and I are organising the
first Miss Poplar beauty contest.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.370
It's going to be on Whit Monday.

05:29.420 --> 05:31.210
So whose name can I put down?

05:31.260 --> 05:34.410
Oh, there's a Â£5 prize and a free hairdo.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.900
There's a home-made dress category
and I'll even knock a few bob off.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.530
I will enter.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.050
Go on, then, I will too.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.210
Sounds like it might be fun.

05:46.260 --> 05:47.930
Trixie, what about you?

05:47.980 --> 05:50.890
Oh, now that Christopher and
I are very serious, I think

05:50.940 --> 05:52.530
I'd better step aside on this one.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.890
But I'll be there to cheer you on.

05:54.940 --> 05:57.050
Now, chop chop, ladies, let's get going.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.260
Magda, follow me.

06:01.780 --> 06:05.890
So, children, in front of me I
have a bowl of water, a flannel,

06:05.940 --> 06:09.690
a bar of soap and a tin of talcum powder.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.650
These are things we should use every day.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.850
Morning and night.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.490
And just to help you all
on your way, I'm going

06:16.540 --> 06:19.940
to give each of you your own bar of
Wright's Coal Tar Soap to take home.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.020
Do come and collect one.

06:24.860 --> 06:27.130
There's one for you, too!

06:27.180 --> 06:30.010
She's been having trouble
concentrating recently.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.500
Well, come and collect yours, Wendy.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.140
Oh, dear!

06:42.180 --> 06:44.690
Do try and look where you put your feet.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.260
She's always tripping over herself.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.140
Your knees all right?

06:54.980 --> 06:57.290
That child's really in quite a state.

06:57.340 --> 07:00.930
Unwashed, undernourished,
not to mention the nits.

07:00.980 --> 07:05.370
And her legs are covered in
the most horrible bruises.

07:05.420 --> 07:08.730
I don't know if she's
simply a clumsy child, or...

07:08.780 --> 07:10.480
There's something more worrying.

07:11.420 --> 07:13.170
There's certainly some neglect.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.090
So who knows what else?

07:15.140 --> 07:16.730
What did you say her name was?

07:16.780 --> 07:18.010
Wendy Lunt.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.690
I saw Mrs Lunt yesterday.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.850
Wendy's her eldest.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.850
Something's wrong.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.330
And Mr Lunt...

07:26.380 --> 07:29.050
Think he might have something
to do with these bruises?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.090
I don't know.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.860
I know something's up.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.820
I've asked her to come into clinic.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.450
Better not. Swimwear.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.700
Oh, my! You're brave.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.330
Oh, no, I didn't mean because...

07:48.380 --> 07:51.210
- Are you entering?
- Lord, no!

07:51.260 --> 07:53.970
My mother would have me on
the first boat back to Jamaica

07:54.020 --> 07:55.090
if she found out.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.730
I've volunteered to help with
the stage management instead.

07:57.780 --> 08:01.290
The whole thing puts me in mind
of the Great Yorkshire Show.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.370
All those prize Jerseys being
paraded around in their ribbons.

08:05.420 --> 08:08.730
Haven't these young women
better things to do than be

08:08.780 --> 08:10.730
gawped at in their unmentionables?

08:10.780 --> 08:15.690
Nurse Crane! I'm sure Violet is
planning a very family-minded event.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.810
I shall happily volunteer
myself for duty that evening

08:18.860 --> 08:21.570
along with any other dissenters.

08:21.620 --> 08:25.570
This is naught but a modern
rendering of the May Queen.

08:25.620 --> 08:29.850
These young girls are offerings
to the fertility gods.

08:29.900 --> 08:33.220
Once, they would've
been sacrificed to them.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.890
Maybe I will have one of those after all.

08:37.940 --> 08:39.929
Er, a moment on the lips, Valerie!

08:39.980 --> 08:43.020
If you're hungry, have a slice of Nimble.

08:49.180 --> 08:52.810
Hello there, I see you've
brought your children.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.610
They didn't want to go to school.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.890
Well, you can have a biscuit in the
cafe while you wait for your mother.

08:58.940 --> 09:01.940
Hello, Mrs Lunt, I'm glad you're here.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.650
Come with me.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.570
And you can collect your prescription

09:07.620 --> 09:10.210
- from Mrs Turner at the desk.
- Thank you.

09:10.260 --> 09:14.130
I'm afraid your blood pressure's
a little high, Mrs Lunt.

09:14.180 --> 09:15.860
Are you feeling anxious?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.050
Why aren't the children in school?

09:19.100 --> 09:23.010
Wendy's been helping me at the laundrette.

09:23.060 --> 09:26.370
They ain't had clean clothes for a while.

09:26.420 --> 09:29.850
And how is everything at home, Mrs Lunt?

09:29.900 --> 09:32.980
Anything you tell me
will be in confidence.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.260
Gordon wouldn't like me talking to you.

09:38.140 --> 09:42.770
I'm going to get Dr Turner
to pop in while you're here.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.740
I won't be a minute.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.530
That's the last box of ribbons.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.450
You'll have to contact the wholesaler!

10:01.500 --> 10:03.610
12 entrants and I'm having
to turn people away.

10:03.660 --> 10:05.010
Oh!

10:05.060 --> 10:08.330
- You going to enter then, Fred?
- Nah, wouldn't be fair on you girls.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.700
I'd walk it.

10:13.060 --> 10:15.370
Oh, you're still here.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.090
Having afternoon tea.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.890
Quite as good as
Claridges, wouldn't you say?

10:19.940 --> 10:21.020
Oh...

10:22.740 --> 10:25.530
I'm afraid your mother had to go home.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.020
Can I have a word, Nurse Franklin?

10:32.780 --> 10:35.250
I'm very worried about Wendy and Kevin.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.850
It's their mother that concerns me.

10:37.900 --> 10:42.660
One mention of the doctor and she
bolted leaving the children behind.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.770
I'll take them. They can walk with me.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.060
Thank you, Trixie.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.410
Nurse Franklin's going to look after you.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.290
Where's our mum gone?

10:56.340 --> 10:57.850
I'm afraid I don't know.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.890
It's cos she don't love us any more!

11:00.940 --> 11:05.460
I'm sure that's not true,
sweetie! I'll take you home.

11:13.620 --> 11:15.060
Get inside.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.410
What are you, a nurse?

11:19.460 --> 11:21.650
Can I come in? I'd like
to speak to Mrs Lunt.

11:21.700 --> 11:22.860
She's asleep.

11:24.260 --> 11:25.500
I'll wait.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.930
How long has it been like this, Mr Lunt?

11:37.980 --> 11:39.340
Months.

11:40.940 --> 11:43.290
This place used to be her pride and joy.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.730
And now I'm ashamed to let you see it.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.610
Pregnancy can be a difficult time.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.370
Some women do feel low.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.010
It was happening before she
fell pregnant. She don't eat.

11:52.060 --> 11:54.730
She don't wash. She don't
lift a finger round the house.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.930
- It's like something's got stuck up here.
- Has she seen the doctor?

11:57.980 --> 11:59.420
That's the thing.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.130
Her old man died in the nuthouse.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.570
And I'm frightened they'll take one
look at her and cart her off there too.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.810
So you've been trying
to manage on your own?

12:09.860 --> 12:11.260
We've been living off scraps.

12:13.380 --> 12:14.900
The kids' clothes are filthy.

12:15.980 --> 12:18.530
We ain't been doing too well, nurse.

12:18.580 --> 12:21.650
Let me make her an
appointment with Dr Turner.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.380
No, no, no, no.

12:25.780 --> 12:27.810
I know what them doctors are like.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.810
Just for a check-up. She won't
be "carted off" anywhere.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.660
Is that a promise, nurse?

12:35.140 --> 12:37.290
Are you going to help Mum get better?

12:37.340 --> 12:39.500
I'm going to try.

12:41.980 --> 12:45.210
I promise I'll do everything
I can to help you all.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.340
How's that?

12:53.820 --> 12:57.210
The name's Buckle...

12:57.260 --> 12:59.370
.. Fred Buckle.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.970
Where on earth did you get that?!

13:02.020 --> 13:04.530
Borrowed it off of Mickey
Lawson's brother-in-law.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.770
He does the bingo calling
down at the Granada.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.370
I thought, well, if I'm
going to do the MC-ing,

13:09.420 --> 13:10.970
might as well look the part.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.730
It's not meant to be funny!

13:12.780 --> 13:14.370
I thought I look rather dashing.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.690
You look very handsome indeed.

13:16.740 --> 13:19.660
It might just need a small adjustment.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.570
Reflexes are normal, Mrs Lunt.

13:30.620 --> 13:33.220
Stick out your tongue, please.

13:35.860 --> 13:38.860
Now raise your arms for me like this.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.210
Your arms look fidgety.

13:44.260 --> 13:47.890
How have you been feeling
lately, in yourself?

13:47.940 --> 13:50.060
Right as rain.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.850
All the girls are representing
their place of work.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.810
There's Miss Tate & Lyle Typing Pool,

13:56.860 --> 13:58.770
Miss Weights And Measures Office,

13:58.820 --> 14:00.610
Miss Frith's the Confectioner.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.930
And you'll all be wearing swimsuits?

14:02.980 --> 14:06.450
And evening dresses and there's
a home-made dress round, too.

14:06.500 --> 14:11.130
So I was wondering if I could
go as Miss Nonnatus House?

14:11.180 --> 14:14.100
Or perhaps Miss Black Sail Public House?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.460
So a busy afternoon ahead.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.330
Ooh, and while I remember,

14:25.380 --> 14:29.250
Nurse Anderson, I'd like you
to visit Mrs Norman, only do be

14:29.300 --> 14:33.530
wary, her husband's got an Alsatian
and he can be rather amorous.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.090
The husband or the dog?

14:37.060 --> 14:38.690
Good afternoon, Dr Turner!

14:38.740 --> 14:41.730
I'm afraid I'm going to
rather spoil those smiles.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.090
I saw one of your ladies this morning.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.210
Doreen Lunt.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.890
Oh, how is she?

14:46.940 --> 14:48.090
I hate to say this,

14:48.140 --> 14:51.050
but it's almost certainly some
kind of neurological problem.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.730
Possibly a brain tumour.

14:52.780 --> 14:55.250
I've referred her to the
Neurology Department.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.490
Oh, no. Poor Mrs Lunt.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.250
Poor Mr Lunt, too.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.220
He's barely managing to hold
the family together as it is.

15:19.140 --> 15:21.010
Valerie?

15:21.060 --> 15:24.170
Oh, sorry.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.130
You caught me red-handed.

15:26.180 --> 15:28.680
I keep my secret cache of
chocolate in the fridge.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.490
Thank you.

15:31.540 --> 15:33.770
Underneath the Ergometrine.

15:33.820 --> 15:37.220
Come on, let's go and
get this dress sorted.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.380
Hold still...

15:45.380 --> 15:48.170
This will do nicely.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.370
You deserve a cocktail.

15:50.420 --> 15:53.770
- From me, to say thank you.
- What a treat!

15:53.820 --> 15:55.650
A Soixante Quinze.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.770
I learnt how to make them in Paris.

15:57.820 --> 15:59.570
Not for me, thank you.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.210
I don't want to smudge.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.650
At school they told us

16:02.700 --> 16:04.850
nail polish was the worst
kind of Western decadence.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.700
They're quite wrong.
It's the very best kind.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.330
We used burnt match sticks for eyeliner,

16:11.380 --> 16:13.490
and beetroot juice for rouge.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.730
You can imagine what arriving
in the West was like.

16:16.780 --> 16:19.970
Was it dangerous? Getting
across the Iron Curtain?

16:20.020 --> 16:21.690
We went at night.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.650
Had to lie flat on the ground every time

16:23.700 --> 16:25.770
the searchlight of the
watchtower came round.

16:25.820 --> 16:28.420
Then we dug a hole to get under the wire.

16:30.660 --> 16:35.500
Six weeks in an Austrian refugee
camp, then I managed to reach Paris.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.370
I thought my journey here was hard.

16:38.420 --> 16:41.450
It was nothing compared to yours.

16:44.180 --> 16:47.370
Did a handsome Frenchman
sweep you off your feet?

16:47.420 --> 16:48.890
Something like that.

16:48.940 --> 16:51.130
He was a student at the Sorbonne.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.260
Very clever, very charming.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.850
We planned to marry.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.980
So why on earth did you
swap Paris for Poplar?!

17:00.740 --> 17:04.290
After he thought I was
flirting with his friend.

17:04.339 --> 17:05.609
Oh, no.

17:05.660 --> 17:09.700
I am glad I left, it leaves
me free to meet Sean Connery.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.810
To Paris.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.210
To London.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.780
To best home-made dress.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.810
Any headaches, Mrs Lunt?

17:23.859 --> 17:25.099
Fit as a fiddle.

17:26.940 --> 17:29.700
Could you take a seat for me now?

17:40.740 --> 17:43.250
Well, I think we can
rule out a brain tumour.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.780
I'll contact your GP.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.330
Mr Dockerill, you really are rather late.

17:52.380 --> 17:55.290
If you weren't so dashing
in your summer suit

17:55.340 --> 17:57.810
- I should be positively furious.
- I'm so sorry.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.490
It was Alexandra.

17:59.540 --> 18:01.890
Oh, don't tell me the
rabbit escaped again!

18:01.940 --> 18:04.290
She wet herself at school.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.130
Oh, no, poor thing.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.490
And apparently it wasn't the first time.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.970
She's been having nightmares.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.860
Every night, for over a month now.

18:14.140 --> 18:17.450
- Moira wants her to see
a psychiatrist. - Oh.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.050
Seems a rather drastic step to me.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.770
Children have these phases, don't they?

18:21.820 --> 18:25.060
She'll probably be fine
by the time she sees him.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.260
Yes, I'm sure.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.220
The Birds is on at the Rialto.

18:33.860 --> 18:37.060
Shall we go and scare
ourselves silly again?

18:41.420 --> 18:45.130
So how many tickets you sold so far, then?

18:45.180 --> 18:46.450
Erm...

18:46.500 --> 18:47.570
Oh, 11.

18:47.620 --> 18:48.770
Er, to the WVS.

18:48.820 --> 18:53.120
Only the older ladies, mind, the younger girls
don't seem to want their husbands to come.

18:55.020 --> 18:59.130
Dr Atherton thinks that your
wife has an illness called

18:59.180 --> 19:00.930
Huntington's Chorea.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.570
Never heard of it.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.940
It's a very rare condition
that runs in families.

19:07.060 --> 19:10.690
It causes problems with the
way that you move your body,

19:10.740 --> 19:12.860
and the way you think and speak.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.850
So what if she's a bit slow?

19:15.900 --> 19:17.890
We can live with that, can't we?

19:17.940 --> 19:21.650
I'm afraid it will get worse
over the next few years.

19:21.700 --> 19:25.490
Eventually it affects
every part of the body.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.020
I'm so sorry, Mrs Lunt.

19:29.260 --> 19:30.860
I need a smoke.

19:38.980 --> 19:44.290
We will support you both, and the
children, in every way we can.

19:44.340 --> 19:46.290
She's going to get better, right?

19:46.340 --> 19:48.650
I mean, this ain't like when her dad died.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.370
You can do all sorts nowadays,

19:50.420 --> 19:52.930
they can put a man in
space for Christ's sake.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.460
I wish I could say yes.

19:56.540 --> 20:00.170
There are some things we just
don't understand well enough

20:00.220 --> 20:01.860
to be able to treat.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.020
Is she going to...?

20:06.820 --> 20:08.780
Not for a long time.

20:10.780 --> 20:14.930
It's unlikely she'll be able to live
at home for more than a few years.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.580
And the kids?

20:17.740 --> 20:22.900
I mean, if her dad had it,
then they might get it too.

20:24.980 --> 20:27.290
There's a 50% chance.

20:27.340 --> 20:30.260
I am so very, very sorry.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.810
What time do you call this?!

20:37.860 --> 20:41.810
Tea's in the oven, the
chops'll be like shoe leather.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.570
Not to worry.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.170
I may've had a pickled egg or two.

20:46.220 --> 20:49.210
Oh, so while I've been
slaving over my sashes,

20:49.260 --> 20:51.370
you've been down the Black Sail.

20:51.420 --> 20:52.660
How many you had?!

20:53.580 --> 20:56.290
One... erm... in the Waterman.

20:56.340 --> 20:57.970
And one in the Admiral.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.570
No! Maybe two in the Admiral.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.490
Fred Buckle, you idle drunken beggar!

21:02.540 --> 21:05.060
It was business, not pleasure!

21:09.900 --> 21:11.090
What's that?

21:11.140 --> 21:12.730
Ticket sales.

21:12.780 --> 21:14.250
We are sold out.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.420
Oh!

21:25.940 --> 21:28.810
Remember that day at Clacton?

21:28.860 --> 21:31.100
When I made us go swimming.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.060
Even though we was the only
ones mad enough to go in.

21:40.860 --> 21:42.460
I'm going to look after you.

21:43.660 --> 21:44.980
And the baby.

21:46.580 --> 21:47.700
And the kids.

21:49.260 --> 21:51.210
All of us.

21:51.260 --> 21:52.980
I ain't going to let you down.

21:54.340 --> 21:56.260
Yeah, I know, darling.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.100
You have a good shift, yeah?

22:08.460 --> 22:11.020
Yes, absolutely, thank you.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.250
Mrs Lunt's gone into labour.

22:15.300 --> 22:18.450
I've been looking into Huntingdon's
Chorea just in case it would

22:18.500 --> 22:19.890
affect the birth.

22:19.940 --> 22:21.970
There's no treatment for it.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.210
It's in her genes.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.850
It's as much a part of her as her
eye colour or the size of her feet.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.340
That poor family.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.660
One wonders if she'll be able
to manage with the new baby.

22:47.980 --> 22:49.260
Come in.

22:53.020 --> 22:57.050
Oh, Lucille, we've sold all the tickets!

22:57.100 --> 22:58.530
That's wonderful, isn't it?

22:58.580 --> 23:00.850
Yes, but there's still so much to do.

23:00.900 --> 23:04.690
There's the music, the set design,
not to mention the refreshments.

23:04.740 --> 23:07.570
You couldn't take on a
few extra jobs, could you?

23:07.620 --> 23:12.050
Of course! I do love a community
event, reminds me of home.

23:12.100 --> 23:16.340
Thank you, Lucille! I took
the liberty of making a list.

23:23.740 --> 23:25.260
Thank you.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.410
You're aware that both the Pill

23:32.460 --> 23:35.170
and the Dutch cap can only be
prescribed for married women.

23:35.220 --> 23:37.450
I'm getting married in a few months' time.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.490
Ah, well, I'd like to make
sure everything's in order.

23:40.540 --> 23:44.540
So, jump up on the bed and
we'll do the internal exam.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.140
Make yourself comfortable.

23:51.620 --> 23:53.820
Put this here and have a feel.

24:02.820 --> 24:06.210
When was the first day of
your last period, Miss Kovacs?

24:06.260 --> 24:07.500
I can't remember.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.130
In France.

24:10.180 --> 24:13.490
Well you might want to get a
move on with your wedding plans.

24:13.540 --> 24:16.060
I'd say you're two months' pregnant.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.530
Everything's progressing nicely.

24:27.580 --> 24:30.010
You're doing very well indeed.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.290
Would you like a drink?

24:32.340 --> 24:34.660
Is there anything else I can get you?

24:36.180 --> 24:39.100
All I want is quiet, nurse.

24:40.420 --> 24:43.770
Reckon my body knows
what it's doing by now.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.260
Of course.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.170
What can I do?

24:52.220 --> 24:55.130
If you decide to stay here, we can
provide all your antenatal care...

24:55.180 --> 24:57.810
No...

24:57.860 --> 24:59.810
I mean for an abortion.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.330
I'm sorry, Miss Kovacs,

25:01.380 --> 25:04.050
there are no circumstances
under which that is allowable.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.970
Except in the gravest
threat to the mother's life.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.610
But in Hungary it is legal up to 12 weeks.

25:09.660 --> 25:13.770
This is not the Communist block,
Miss Kovacs, this is England,

25:13.820 --> 25:17.170
and we do not give out abortions
to any woman who demands one.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.370
But I cannot have a baby.

25:19.420 --> 25:22.020
I have no family, no friends, no money.

25:23.060 --> 25:25.570
Please, there must be
some way you can help.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.100
Well, what about your fiance?

25:33.100 --> 25:35.060
There is no fiance, is there?

25:51.580 --> 25:53.650
Small breaths. Pant.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.170
That's it.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.460
Small pushes.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.090
Gently.

26:04.140 --> 26:06.770
Small pushes. Small pushes.

26:06.820 --> 26:08.820
Gently now.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.220
Gently.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.100
Here we are.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.570
Nearly there.

26:21.620 --> 26:23.570
Just the shoulders.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.530
There...

26:25.580 --> 26:27.610
There...

26:27.660 --> 26:29.060
Clever girl.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.210
I've got her.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.700
I've got her.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.610
Well done, Doreen.

26:41.660 --> 26:44.340
You have a perfect daughter.

26:48.420 --> 26:50.050
Is she really mine?

26:50.100 --> 26:51.420
Yes, she is.

26:53.700 --> 26:55.500
Mm? Mm...

26:58.900 --> 27:00.740
You go to your mummy now.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.810
Sshh...

27:04.860 --> 27:06.540
I love you, baby.

27:16.820 --> 27:18.210
Relax.

27:18.260 --> 27:21.130
Now, tummies pulled in, bosoms out.

27:21.180 --> 27:24.570
Deep breath and smile.

27:24.620 --> 27:29.260
Now, Valerie, nice short steps, and
remember to look at your audience!

27:39.380 --> 27:42.410
You look as though you're trying
to catch the number seven bus.

27:42.460 --> 27:46.090
I want to see you glide like a
swan, not galumph like an elephant.

27:46.140 --> 27:49.650
And try and look as though
you're enjoying yourselves!

27:49.700 --> 27:51.490
Come on then, girls.

27:51.540 --> 27:55.130
âª How do you do what you do... âª

27:55.180 --> 27:56.530
Much better!

27:56.580 --> 27:58.410
And glide!

27:58.460 --> 28:00.620
And glide...

28:06.100 --> 28:07.220
Sorry.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.090
I told you about my Frenchman.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.810
What about you?

28:13.860 --> 28:15.770
You must have boyfriend.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.330
Men are altogether more
trouble than they're worth.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.410
So you have had boyfriends?

28:20.460 --> 28:22.340
I might've done!

28:29.060 --> 28:30.890
Did you take precautions?

28:30.940 --> 28:32.130
Magda!

28:32.180 --> 28:33.660
I'm sorry.

28:34.940 --> 28:39.300
If I ask you something, would you
promise not to tell anybody else?

28:41.620 --> 28:44.980
If you were to get into trouble...

28:46.940 --> 28:48.730
is there somewhere you would go?

28:48.780 --> 28:50.140
A lady who might help you?

28:52.220 --> 28:53.540
A lady who might...?

28:55.220 --> 28:57.090
Do you mean...?

28:57.140 --> 28:59.060
Do you think you might be...?

29:00.220 --> 29:02.690
Please. I know it is not legal,

29:02.740 --> 29:06.690
but I've read about women
who I could go to...

29:06.740 --> 29:10.010
Believe me, that is not a
road you want to go down,

29:10.060 --> 29:13.460
and if you'd seen the things I've
seen, you wouldn't even be asking.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.370
Have you told the Turners?

29:16.420 --> 29:18.410
You've got to tell them.

29:18.460 --> 29:20.290
They can help.

29:20.340 --> 29:24.140
Promise me, no more talk of finding one
of those women, you hear? Promise me.

29:37.580 --> 29:40.410
From what I can see, it shouldn't blister.

29:40.460 --> 29:42.290
She's always dropping stuff.

29:42.340 --> 29:43.970
Drives us all mad.

29:44.020 --> 29:47.690
Oh and many congratulations
on your new arrival, Mr Lunt.

29:47.740 --> 29:49.900
- I'm thrilled for you all.
- Thanks, Doc.

29:55.540 --> 29:58.220
Are Wendy's movements a bit unstable?

30:03.500 --> 30:06.330
Apparently, barely a day goes past

30:06.380 --> 30:09.060
without Wendy tripping over,
or dropping something.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.770
Her limbs are stiff and rigid,

30:11.820 --> 30:14.970
and she's been irritable and
underperforming in school.

30:15.020 --> 30:17.170
I've referred her to St Cuthburt's.

30:17.220 --> 30:20.010
You're not thinking she's
got Huntington's as well?

30:20.060 --> 30:23.490
There's a juvenile version
that causes these symptoms.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.690
It's incredibly rare for a child

30:25.740 --> 30:28.010
to develop it this early
from their mother.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.010
But it's not unheard of.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.690
Drum roll, please.

30:31.740 --> 30:34.890
Now this is truly a first.

30:34.940 --> 30:40.250
Traditional Hungarian porkolt stew
with paprika and caraway seeds.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.330
Oh, it smells delicious.

30:42.380 --> 30:44.890
Is it one of your mother's dishes Magda?

30:44.940 --> 30:48.340
My grandmother's. My mother
was usually too busy nursing.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.250
Actually, Mrs Turner...

30:56.300 --> 30:59.010
I was wondering if I could
borrow your nursing books.

30:59.060 --> 31:02.330
I have decided I would like
to apply for nursing training,

31:02.380 --> 31:03.770
after I finish working for you.

31:03.820 --> 31:07.170
- Of course. That's wonderful news!
- The family trade, eh?

31:07.220 --> 31:10.330
I'm sure your parents
would be very proud, Magda.

31:10.380 --> 31:13.050
- I'll dig out my old books for you.
- Thank you.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.100
And we've got all the back copies
of the Lancet you can manage.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.690
Hmm...

31:23.460 --> 31:25.970
She's a little darling, ain't she, Nurse?

31:26.020 --> 31:28.130
She most certainly is.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.860
I've brought her bottle for you.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.300
Mrs Lunt?

31:34.900 --> 31:38.490
She seems to want to hold her
excessively, barely puts her down.

31:38.540 --> 31:41.770
But she's shown little interest
in feeding or changing her.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.450
Is it the illness?

31:43.500 --> 31:44.930
It could be.

31:44.980 --> 31:48.370
Or it could be the
exhaustion of any new mother.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.500
- I hope it's the latter.
- So do I.

31:51.820 --> 31:53.610
Let's just give her time.

31:53.660 --> 31:56.010
She'll be with us for a few days yet.

31:56.060 --> 31:57.890
Is there any news of Wendy?

31:57.940 --> 31:59.700
She's with the neurologist today.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.900
Now, Wendy, pop onto the couch
for me, there's a good girl.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.300
What did the psychiatrist say?

32:24.700 --> 32:27.180
That we need a very fixed set of rules.

32:28.660 --> 32:31.930
That I should only see her
on fixed days of the week.

32:31.980 --> 32:35.010
That I shouldn't meet her from
school any more, because it...

32:35.060 --> 32:39.300
.. singles her out and
emphasises the stigma of divorce.

32:43.740 --> 32:47.090
And that she shouldn't have to
see you if she doesn't want to.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.970
Doesn't she want to see me?

32:49.020 --> 32:51.770
She loves you almost as much
as I do, Trixie, but she's...

32:51.820 --> 32:55.410
If you do really love me,
don't say anything else.

32:55.460 --> 32:58.490
I said at the very beginning,
that I didn't want to meet her

32:58.540 --> 33:00.290
if it wasn't going to be good for her.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.090
You aren't to blame for any of this.

33:02.140 --> 33:03.890
No.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.180
But nor is she.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.740
We'll work this out, I promise you.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.770
There's a way for us all to be happy

33:14.820 --> 33:16.380
and we're going to find it.

33:19.260 --> 33:20.730
Daddy...

33:20.780 --> 33:22.490
.. I want to go home.

33:22.540 --> 33:24.100
Of course, sweetheart.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.500
Have you told Mrs Turner yet?

33:32.660 --> 33:34.370
You must tell her.

33:34.420 --> 33:36.060
I started bleeding in the night.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.370
I think the problem may be fixing itself.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.770
A bit of blood can be normal.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.620
I'm sorry, but it doesn't
mean you'll lose it.

33:48.100 --> 33:49.700
Remember what you promised me.

33:51.180 --> 33:54.300
And for Heaven's sake, tell Mrs Turner.

34:03.260 --> 34:04.340
That's it.

34:05.940 --> 34:07.650
Good afternoon, Mr Lunt.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.250
Come to say hello to
your two lovely girls?

34:10.300 --> 34:12.219
Been to see that doctor again.

34:16.900 --> 34:18.610
What did he say?

34:18.659 --> 34:20.969
- Wendy's got it, too.
- Oh, no.

34:21.020 --> 34:22.260
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr Lunt.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.570
They're talking about...

34:26.620 --> 34:30.290
.. sending her away from
her family, to some...

34:30.340 --> 34:31.900
.. residential home.

34:33.060 --> 34:35.330
He knows we ain't going
to be able to manage,

34:35.380 --> 34:37.659
what with Doreen in the
state that she's in.

34:39.500 --> 34:43.409
Perhaps if you got things a bit
more under control at home.

34:43.460 --> 34:46.570
There are health visitors, social
workers who can support you.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.929
No, no as soon as they get
their foot in the door,

34:49.980 --> 34:51.580
then we're done for.

34:53.540 --> 34:55.290
But you could help us, Nurse.

34:55.340 --> 34:56.730
You promised.

34:56.780 --> 34:59.210
You said you'd do
whatever you could. Please.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.010
Please.

35:01.060 --> 35:02.860
Help me help my kids.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.530
If you promise

35:08.580 --> 35:12.740
to get the proper help once we've
got you shipshape, then yes.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.420
I will.

35:20.060 --> 35:23.450
âª Tonight you're mine...

35:23.500 --> 35:26.690
âª Completely...

35:26.740 --> 35:28.050
Abortion.

35:28.100 --> 35:32.570
âª You give your love so sweetly... âª

35:32.620 --> 35:34.370
Hello, Wendy.

35:34.420 --> 35:36.380
Hello, Kevin.

35:37.780 --> 35:40.220
Are you ready to learn
how to sterilise a bottle?

35:41.860 --> 35:47.380
âª But will you love me tomorrow? âª

35:49.180 --> 35:50.900
Ergometrine.

35:52.940 --> 35:55.810
"Make the uterine muscle contract".

35:55.860 --> 36:01.810
âª Or just a moment's pleasure?

36:01.860 --> 36:03.730
âª Can I

36:03.780 --> 36:08.930
âª Believe the magic of your sighs?

36:08.980 --> 36:11.970
âª Will you still love me

36:12.020 --> 36:15.770
âª Tomorrow?

36:15.820 --> 36:18.810
âª Tonight with words

36:18.860 --> 36:21.940
âª Unspoken

36:23.700 --> 36:28.300
âª You say that I'm the only one... âª

36:30.020 --> 36:32.010
Well done, Mr Lunt.

36:32.060 --> 36:34.730
It's a fine homecoming
for your new daughter.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.220
- Mm...
- Is that you, Magda?

36:46.700 --> 36:48.140
Madga?

36:51.100 --> 36:53.020
Are you feeling unwell?

36:56.500 --> 36:58.420
I'll see to him, Mrs Turner.

37:07.180 --> 37:09.090
Midwife calling. Good afternoon, Mrs Lunt.

37:09.140 --> 37:11.770
I was nearby, so I thought I'd
come and see how you were doing.

37:11.820 --> 37:13.570
Shall I take her?

37:13.620 --> 37:15.970
Oh... There, there, sweetheart.

37:16.020 --> 37:17.890
What's the matter? Are you hungry?

37:17.940 --> 37:19.450
No.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.450
You need changing.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.180
Yes.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.420
You poor little thing.

37:40.820 --> 37:46.450
âª We walked the road of life

37:46.500 --> 37:48.210
âª Together... âª

37:48.260 --> 37:50.090
That you, Trix?

37:50.140 --> 37:51.650
Yes.

37:51.700 --> 37:54.580
Getting an early night
before the big day tomorrow?

37:56.900 --> 37:59.490
Everything looking
shipshape at the institute?

37:59.540 --> 38:01.020
Absolutely.

38:06.420 --> 38:11.130
Mr Lunt, your daughter's nappy
hadn't been changed for some time.

38:11.180 --> 38:13.730
I know how hard you've tried.

38:13.780 --> 38:17.330
I know how much you want to keep
your children at home with you.

38:17.380 --> 38:19.850
But Mrs Lunt...

38:19.900 --> 38:23.130
.. simply isn't well enough
to take care of them any more.

38:23.180 --> 38:25.930
But I know what I'm doing
now, Doc. Nurse showed me.

38:25.980 --> 38:29.260
Your wife's condition is
only going to get worse.

38:31.380 --> 38:34.090
It's likely the baby will
need to go to a foster carer.

38:34.140 --> 38:38.220
And there is a place ready for
Wendy at the residential home.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.420
I'm so sorry, Mr Lunt.

38:44.340 --> 38:47.740
As a father myself, I can
only imagine how it feels.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.740
You did everything you could.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.580
- No-one could've done more.
- I'll try harder.

38:56.580 --> 38:57.770
Please.

38:57.820 --> 38:59.730
Help, Nurse. Please.

38:59.780 --> 39:01.810
Don't let 'em take our kids.

39:01.860 --> 39:03.260
I'm so sorry.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.010
Fit for a queen.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.650
Well, a beauty queen, at least.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.970
Oh, please let that be Lucille.
She said she'd be here by ten.

39:29.020 --> 39:33.610
Don't panic, Mrs Buckle. I'm here,
and bearing gifts from my church.

39:33.660 --> 39:36.090
Well, more of a loan.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.810
A microphone.

39:37.860 --> 39:41.250
I made a strict promise to
return it at the end of the day.

39:41.300 --> 39:44.010
Lucille, you are truly Heaven sent.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.660
There you go.

39:52.620 --> 39:53.740
Magda!

39:55.860 --> 39:58.650
Now's no time for studying,
you should be getting ready!

39:58.700 --> 40:00.180
Yes.

40:07.860 --> 40:09.130
Take your seats, folks

40:09.180 --> 40:13.090
-- and prepare to be dazzled
by the most gorgeous girls,

40:13.140 --> 40:14.530
the finest fillies,

40:14.580 --> 40:20.450
and stunned by the loveliest
ladies you are ever likely to see.

40:20.500 --> 40:24.730
- Violet! - Truly the flower
of womanhood in full bloom.

40:24.780 --> 40:28.690
And I count my lovely wife amongst them.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.290
I do hope Teddy will
be good for Mrs Towey.

40:34.340 --> 40:37.730
She promised to bring Angela shortly
so she can give the bouquets.

40:37.780 --> 40:40.050
Here he comes.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.850
Good luck with the music.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.970
And remember, Timothy...

40:44.020 --> 40:46.290
.. focus on the piano.

40:48.180 --> 40:52.170
Meanwhile, for your delight,
on the old Joanna, we have young

40:52.220 --> 40:54.100
Timothy Turner!

40:56.900 --> 40:58.290
How are you?

40:58.340 --> 41:00.090
Have you spoken to Shelagh?

41:00.140 --> 41:01.690
Everything under control?

41:01.740 --> 41:03.170
Yes, here's the list of girls.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.370
Thank you.

41:05.920 --> 41:06.750
Sorry!

41:06.900 --> 41:07.970
OK.

41:08.020 --> 41:10.820
- Good luck, ladies.
- Hurry up, girls. We need you backstage.

41:17.700 --> 41:20.930
I've got a bad headache.
Can you tell them I'm sorry?

41:20.980 --> 41:22.460
Course.

41:23.780 --> 41:26.450
And so, ladies and gentlemen...

41:26.500 --> 41:31.570
welcome to the very first
Miss Poplar beauty contest!

41:32.820 --> 41:35.370
Prepare to be dazzled by perfection.

41:35.420 --> 41:37.940
Fanfare, please!

41:41.220 --> 41:42.610
You look lovely.

41:42.660 --> 41:46.650
- I feel nervous. - Good
luck. - Ladies and gentlemen,

41:46.700 --> 41:50.130
for your delectation, here they are!

41:50.180 --> 41:53.650
12 home grown luscious ladies,

41:53.700 --> 41:56.970
all representing a local business.

42:00.580 --> 42:03.130
Shelagh, Magda had to go home, she's ill.

42:03.180 --> 42:06.370
- Did you pick 'em Fred?
- No! The wife would kill me, wouldn't you love?

42:06.420 --> 42:07.860
Fred Buckle!

42:09.460 --> 42:10.890
Should we meet our first girl?

42:10.940 --> 42:14.890
- Such a shame about Magda. Maybe I should go
and check on her. - 'She's Margaret Brittan...

42:14.940 --> 42:16.250
Oh, Angela!

42:16.300 --> 42:18.290
Come and have a look at the pretty ladies.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.100
She's a trainee accountant...

42:37.340 --> 42:40.090
Let's have a big hand for our first girl,

42:40.140 --> 42:44.690
she's a trainee accountant
at Herb-son Brown.

42:44.740 --> 42:46.290
Isn't she lovely?

43:15.340 --> 43:20.380
And finally, what would you
do to bring about world peace?

43:21.660 --> 43:23.260
I'd put a Poplar woman in charge.

43:26.340 --> 43:29.290
Anyone who's seen my auntie at
closing time on a Saturday knows...

43:29.340 --> 43:31.050
.. we don't put up with any messing.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.140
Here, here!

43:54.380 --> 43:59.130
And I have no doubt, we have
a future Miss Great Britain

43:59.180 --> 44:03.450
in the room here today, and
maybe even a future Miss World!

44:08.220 --> 44:10.220
You heard it here first, folks!

44:30.580 --> 44:32.610
Magda, is it not?

44:32.660 --> 44:35.180
Sorry, I have to go.

44:39.940 --> 44:42.810
Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in.

44:44.540 --> 44:46.100
Patience is a virtue.

44:47.100 --> 44:49.740
In reverse order...

44:56.660 --> 45:02.410
Miss Poplar 1963 is...

45:02.960 --> 45:05.060
Wait for it!

45:18.260 --> 45:22.610
Miss Weights and Measures
Office, Ruth Gardner!

45:28.620 --> 45:31.850
Congratulations to our lovely winner!

45:31.900 --> 45:36.890
But you're all winners, and
I think you're all fabulous,

45:36.940 --> 45:39.610
so can we have a big round
of applause for everybody,

45:39.660 --> 45:40.940
ladies and gentlemen?

45:56.700 --> 45:59.570
And a special commendation for...

45:59.620 --> 46:05.450
.. Miss Black Sail Public
House for best home-made dress.

46:10.140 --> 46:12.970
And she did it all
herself, you know, at home!

46:14.940 --> 46:18.970
And a round of applause please for
our flower girl, Angela Turner.

46:22.020 --> 46:24.850
Put your hands together now and
thank all our lovely contestants.

46:24.900 --> 46:26.090
Aren't they wonderful?

46:26.140 --> 46:28.610
Sister Monica Joan called
from Nonnatus House.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.300
Something's wrong with Magda.

46:32.420 --> 46:35.170
[And finally, I'd like to
thank you all for coming out]

46:35.220 --> 46:37.780
- [and supporting...]
- Look after those for me, love.

46:41.780 --> 46:43.460
Oh, no.

46:47.060 --> 46:49.140
I saw her hastening away.

46:51.500 --> 46:52.820
Ergometrine.

46:54.220 --> 46:56.570
What on earth was she
doing with ergometrine?

46:56.620 --> 46:58.340
I'm afraid...

47:00.060 --> 47:02.220
- She's pregnant.
- What?!

47:05.260 --> 47:09.250
I believe she may have sought
solace among the seedlings

47:09.300 --> 47:11.820
in Fred Buckle's allotment.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.980
Magda?

47:26.340 --> 47:28.620
Magda, can you hear me?

47:30.340 --> 47:31.700
Can you call an ambulance?

47:33.140 --> 47:34.810
Magda, did you take ergometrine?

47:34.860 --> 47:36.980
Are you trying to cause an abortion?

47:41.340 --> 47:43.290
I'm waiting for it to...

47:43.340 --> 47:44.980
.. come away.

47:51.660 --> 47:55.010
Number six is inconsolable in the ladies.

47:55.060 --> 47:57.860
I shall dispense tissues
and words of comfort.

47:59.100 --> 48:00.370
Can I get a photo?

48:00.420 --> 48:01.780
The two of us!

48:07.260 --> 48:09.130
I should've told you.

48:09.180 --> 48:11.260
I'm so sorry.

48:13.100 --> 48:14.780
Why didn't she talk to me?

48:28.900 --> 48:31.540
They've performed a D and
C to stop the bleeding.

48:32.780 --> 48:34.660
She's unwell, but stable.

48:36.060 --> 48:37.650
Why didn't I see it?

48:37.700 --> 48:39.370
None of this is your fault.

48:39.420 --> 48:42.660
She was under our roof, our employee.

48:44.780 --> 48:47.500
And I gave her the books, Patrick...

48:54.740 --> 48:57.130
Magda is being discharged
from hospital today.

48:57.180 --> 48:59.570
I should've told Mrs Turner.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.370
Then she might not have done it.

49:01.420 --> 49:03.210
You respected her privacy.

49:03.260 --> 49:07.450
Without your prompt action, she
would almost certainly have died.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.210
Sister Monica Joan's actions
are to be commended, too.

49:10.260 --> 49:13.850
I have often sought sanctuary
in that allotment myself.

49:13.900 --> 49:15.100
Poor child.

49:17.540 --> 49:18.890
But...

49:18.940 --> 49:21.450
.. an abortion on convent grounds.

49:21.500 --> 49:24.050
Not to mention the theft of drugs.

49:24.100 --> 49:26.580
Will the incident be reported?

49:28.060 --> 49:30.490
I've been trying to answer
that question myself.

49:30.540 --> 49:32.610
Magda has suffered greatly.

49:32.660 --> 49:36.260
I cannot, in all conscience,
inflict further pain.

49:46.860 --> 49:48.970
You be a good girl for Nurse Franklin now.

49:49.020 --> 49:51.620
And remember how much your
old mum and dad love you.

49:53.020 --> 49:55.500
- Mum doesn't.
- You must never say that, you hear me?

49:57.020 --> 49:58.540
Your mum's not very well.

49:59.700 --> 50:02.780
She's not herself any more, but
she loves you very, very much.

50:09.380 --> 50:10.860
Doreen...

50:12.380 --> 50:13.860
.. Wendy's going now.

50:20.060 --> 50:23.500
I suggest we make a detour via
the sweetie shop on the way.

50:55.180 --> 50:58.530
It's actually rather a treat,
me taking you to Roseleigh Park.

50:58.580 --> 51:01.250
I can never resist a bus
ride on a sunny morning.

51:01.300 --> 51:05.420
I always close my eyes and pretend
I'm Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday.

51:07.740 --> 51:08.940
Wendy!

51:10.140 --> 51:11.660
You forgot this.

51:24.980 --> 51:26.610
I love you.

51:26.660 --> 51:28.260
I love you, too.

52:01.140 --> 52:03.930
I think this lady must
be Mrs Collins, Wendy.

52:03.980 --> 52:06.090
She seems to be expecting us.

52:06.140 --> 52:08.100
Everyone looks happy.

52:10.140 --> 52:12.940
I'm sure they're all terribly
contented little souls.

52:14.300 --> 52:16.540
Then why do they put 'em in here?

52:19.780 --> 52:21.420
Because it's for the best.

52:49.940 --> 52:52.380
Are you sure you don't
want a lift to the station?

52:59.500 --> 53:01.310
I am going to miss you, my darling.

53:01.860 --> 53:05.340
But I have to go back to Paris, to
train as a nurse, like your mummy.

53:09.020 --> 53:10.540
These are for you.

53:12.100 --> 53:14.900
Write to us, Magda -- and
let us know how you are.

53:25.900 --> 53:28.130
I wish your job didn't hurt you so much.

53:28.180 --> 53:29.890
So do I.

53:29.940 --> 53:31.460
Sometimes.

53:33.100 --> 53:35.410
But I wish it didn't
hurt other people more.

53:35.460 --> 53:36.980
No, Trixie.

53:39.060 --> 53:41.130
You've had to do an appalling thing,

53:41.180 --> 53:43.930
but I don't doubt for a
single moment that the care

53:43.980 --> 53:47.410
and love you showed while
doing it made everything better

53:47.460 --> 53:49.100
for everyone concerned.

53:50.300 --> 53:52.300
Thank you for understanding me.

53:58.220 --> 54:00.540
Now I need you to
understand something else.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.220
I want you to go back to your wife.

54:14.180 --> 54:15.860
She's my ex-wife.

54:18.180 --> 54:20.940
And I don't love her, Trixie. I love you.

54:22.300 --> 54:23.780
You love your daughter, too.

54:24.940 --> 54:28.250
If you can't make that little
girl feel cherished and safe,

54:28.300 --> 54:31.970
she's going to go through her whole
life feeling lonely and afraid.

54:32.020 --> 54:35.010
Because she'll be poised to run away.

54:35.060 --> 54:38.220
To take flight, before
something hurts her.

54:40.100 --> 54:41.580
I'm not leaving you, Trixie.

54:43.260 --> 54:46.730
If you don't do whatever you
have to do to create a stable

54:46.780 --> 54:49.860
and secure world for
that beautiful child...

54:52.580 --> 54:56.090
.. then I won't be able to feel the
same way about you that I do now.

54:56.140 --> 54:57.570
We can't just end this.

54:57.620 --> 55:00.210
We can't just walk away
from this amount of love.

55:00.260 --> 55:04.610
Think of it as... walking
towards someone else.

55:04.660 --> 55:06.970
And when you see Alexandra,

55:07.020 --> 55:09.930
tell her everything is
going to be all right.

55:09.980 --> 55:11.500
Because it will be.

55:14.300 --> 55:16.170
And you give her my...

55:16.220 --> 55:18.940
.. deepest and dearest love.

55:22.900 --> 55:24.500
Goodbye, Christopher.

55:43.180 --> 55:46.930
'Love is always deserved by everyone.

55:46.980 --> 55:53.050
But it is not always given,
no matter where we search,

55:53.100 --> 55:56.140
or however much we long for it.

56:11.580 --> 56:14.050
And families can be torn,

56:14.100 --> 56:16.290
as well as drawn together,

56:16.340 --> 56:19.450
by the tie of flesh and blood

56:19.500 --> 56:22.130
and the genes that define us,

56:22.180 --> 56:26.260
or which we inherit and pass on.

56:31.060 --> 56:34.210
Family is the place where life begins.

56:34.260 --> 56:38.010
But it can wound us, even as it nurtures,

56:38.060 --> 56:43.090
leaving us empty instead of fulfilled.

56:43.140 --> 56:47.810
Our hearts beat so loudly...

56:47.860 --> 56:51.140
that we want only silence.

57:18.380 --> 57:20.090
You have taken another wife?

57:20.140 --> 57:21.570
We are blessed.

57:21.620 --> 57:23.250
You are the father?

57:23.300 --> 57:24.530
There she is!

57:24.580 --> 57:26.690
I wonder if she felt
lonely up there by herself?

57:26.740 --> 57:30.890
She's a fearless adventurer,
fulfilling her destiny.

57:30.940 --> 57:33.370
You're a nurse and a midwife.

57:33.420 --> 57:34.890
And there are rules,

57:34.940 --> 57:36.810
rules you've broken.

57:36.860 --> 57:38.540
Are you going to report me?
