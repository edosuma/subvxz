01:22.488 --> 01:24.824
I'll take care of things
from here.

01:27.627 --> 01:28.895
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

01:28.929 --> 01:30.763
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:33.732 --> 01:35.702
So I thought through
every angle

01:35.735 --> 01:37.971
and reverse-engineered
each option.

01:38.004 --> 01:39.172
If our primary is compromised,

01:39.205 --> 01:40.572
I set up
two backside positions

01:40.606 --> 01:42.041
leading down the alley,

01:42.074 --> 01:44.443
where we jammed
those surveillance cameras.

01:45.644 --> 01:48.080
I'm gonna have
two getaway cars positioned

01:48.113 --> 01:50.682
at the north end of the alley,
just off of Fifth Street,

01:50.715 --> 01:52.750
and one on the first floor
of the parking garage.

01:58.856 --> 02:00.125
We all good?

02:01.192 --> 02:03.194
Can I get you guys
anything else?

02:04.529 --> 02:05.630
Let's settle up.

02:05.663 --> 02:07.699
Your money's no good here.

02:08.532 --> 02:09.866
Thanks.

02:09.901 --> 02:11.702
- We good?
- Yeah.

02:11.735 --> 02:13.271
- Take care, all right?
- Take care.

02:13.304 --> 02:15.139
See you guys.

02:15.173 --> 02:16.774
Looks good, fellas.

02:21.578 --> 02:23.580
You sure about this girl?

02:23.613 --> 02:25.582
She took me in
when no one else would.

02:26.883 --> 02:29.920
Trust me. She's been working
this game in this place,

02:29.953 --> 02:31.955
and she's got ties
all over the city.

02:34.191 --> 02:36.093
She's our ace in the hole.

02:37.694 --> 02:39.528
- [scoffs]
- Like you always said.

02:40.596 --> 02:41.897
All right.

02:43.165 --> 02:45.902
No fucking around.
Let's go over this again.

02:48.004 --> 02:49.238
♪♪

02:49.271 --> 02:52.908
[clock ticking]

04:57.161 --> 05:00.830
FRANK: Three-card monte
is a confidence game,

05:00.864 --> 05:02.731
a street hustle,

05:04.033 --> 05:06.002
in which
the object of the game

05:06.035 --> 05:08.138
is to find the money card.

05:09.372 --> 05:10.939
The psychology of the con

05:10.974 --> 05:13.041
is to increase
the mark's confidence

05:13.075 --> 05:16.112
until he believes that
he has a special ability

05:16.146 --> 05:20.115
to cheat the dealer
and win easy money.

05:22.217 --> 05:26.289
The people involved in it
are known as "shills."

05:26.322 --> 05:29.958
They conspire with the mark
to cheat the dealer

05:29.992 --> 05:33.961
when, in fact, they're simply
conspiring with the dealer

05:33.995 --> 05:36.064
to cheat the mark.

05:40.502 --> 05:45.174
[ticking]

06:11.932 --> 06:14.935
It's almost time.
How are we looking?

06:16.102 --> 06:18.104
We sacked
all surveillance cameras

06:18.138 --> 06:19.972
within a six-block radius.

06:22.074 --> 06:24.043
We'll have at least
a 30-minute window

06:24.076 --> 06:27.414
where all of this is clear.

06:27.447 --> 06:29.982
As long as the Sullivan brothers
don't fuck up their end,

06:30.015 --> 06:32.384
we'll be ready to roll out
as soon as they come in?

06:32.418 --> 06:35.821
Well, that doesn't give me
much confidence.

06:35.854 --> 06:39.124
Heard one of your boys
had an image problem.

06:41.993 --> 06:44.462
More like hard-core rotten luck.

06:44.495 --> 06:46.332
Could've happened to anyone.

06:46.365 --> 06:49.901
Yeah, but it happened
to one of your guys.

06:52.937 --> 06:55.407
His brother's a rising star.

06:55.441 --> 06:57.809
He's pulled some major scores.

06:57.842 --> 06:59.310
Is that right?

06:59.344 --> 07:01.079
Yeah, that's right.

07:02.112 --> 07:03.880
As we discussed.

07:03.914 --> 07:07.252
Five hundred for the hardware
and the five-man crew.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.124
The other one mill

07:14.157 --> 07:16.461
will be delivered
upon receipt of the case.

07:22.366 --> 07:23.966
Looks about right.

07:37.947 --> 07:39.849
All of these are clean.

07:39.882 --> 07:43.319
You can dump 'em anywhere
once you finish your next job.

07:43.352 --> 07:45.489
None of 'em can be traced back.

07:45.522 --> 07:47.556
Care to inspect them?

07:47.590 --> 07:49.791
Do I need to?

07:51.226 --> 07:53.862
None of us would be here today

07:53.895 --> 07:58.900
if we didn't believe in
honor amongst thieves, right?

07:58.933 --> 08:00.502
All right, so who are they?

08:00.535 --> 08:04.239
REX: Griffin is the best hacker
I've ever seen.

08:04.272 --> 08:07.042
All he needs is inside access
to the system.

08:07.075 --> 08:09.544
I guarantee you
it's gonna be disabled.

08:11.178 --> 08:14.615
Marshall and Baxter
are toughest guys on the circ.

08:14.648 --> 08:16.917
They will not hesitate
to throw down

08:16.950 --> 08:18.886
if they get backed
into a corner.

08:20.254 --> 08:22.022
Frank and Joe Sullivan.

08:23.624 --> 08:26.994
Frank's the best lock man
outside of New York.

08:27.027 --> 08:29.463
He's never taken a pinch,
unlike his brother.

08:31.198 --> 08:34.500
I was reluctant
to allow a jinx like Joe

08:34.534 --> 08:37.136
onto one of my crews,

08:37.171 --> 08:41.307
but Frank stepped in
and vouched for him.

08:41.341 --> 08:44.310
Then you don't mind personally
guaranteeing delivery.

08:44.344 --> 08:46.079
[chuckles]

08:47.180 --> 08:51.084
Yeah, if everything goes
according to plan,

08:51.117 --> 08:53.251
they'll be hitting the bank
right about now.

09:05.465 --> 09:06.965
Right on time.

09:06.998 --> 09:08.567
At least we got a break
in the rain.

09:10.035 --> 09:12.204
- Let's go, baby.
- Let's do it.

09:12.237 --> 09:13.405
[chuckles]

09:51.708 --> 09:53.676
How can I help you?

09:53.710 --> 09:55.513
I'd appreciate it if you'd
get your ass on the ground.

09:55.546 --> 09:56.579

Don't shoot, don't shoot.

10:04.420 --> 10:05.588
Police!

10:05.622 --> 10:07.590
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun!

10:13.028 --> 10:14.263
Drop it!

10:18.434 --> 10:21.068
Get on the ground.
On the ground!

10:21.102 --> 10:23.739
Ladies and gentlemen,
on the ground.

10:23.772 --> 10:26.542
I thought I told you
to get your ass on the ground.

10:30.144 --> 10:31.712
Thirty seconds,
a new personal best.

10:31.747 --> 10:33.548
You, sir,
need a new security system.

10:33.581 --> 10:35.484
You got the keys?

10:36.585 --> 10:38.219
Vault keys!

10:40.154 --> 10:42.590
There's not much left in there.
We've been flooded out.

10:44.257 --> 10:46.394
- On the ground!
- Okay, okay.

10:51.431 --> 10:53.366
Come on, let's go!

10:53.400 --> 10:55.369
Get out of there!
Come on out!

10:55.403 --> 10:56.737
Let's go!

10:56.771 --> 10:59.339
You make sure your face
is on the ground.

10:59.372 --> 11:02.209
If I see your eyes, I will
put a bullet in your head.

11:03.309 --> 11:05.479
Move! Move!

11:08.482 --> 11:10.149
Come on, move it!

11:10.182 --> 11:11.618
Get down! You too!

11:11.651 --> 11:13.686
The alarm goes off,
I shoot you.

11:13.719 --> 11:16.490
I don't get what I want,
I shoot you.

11:20.526 --> 11:21.627
That's me.

11:25.832 --> 11:27.600
The keys?

11:27.633 --> 11:29.668
Face on the ground!

11:39.544 --> 11:41.179

Ah, we're home free, brother.

13:00.455 --> 13:02.189
- All right.
- Oh, yeah.

Get the chopper!

What's happening out here?

- Get back!
- I have family they're holding!

15:07.543 --> 15:09.778
- Get back! Get back!
- We need help inside!

15:09.812 --> 15:11.747

Let's go, Marsh!

15:52.586 --> 15:53.787
Two suspects.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.823
We gotta get to
the Fifth Street exit.

15:56.857 --> 15:58.792
How the fuck did the cops
get here so fast?

15:58.825 --> 16:00.861
I had it timed out.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.929
Could've been a guard we missed,
a secondary alarm.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.633
Bullshit. I had this
planned out perfectly.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.534
No sense in worrying
about that now.

16:08.567 --> 16:09.902
At the end of the day,

16:09.935 --> 16:12.671
whoever gets the package
gets paid.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.875
Know what? Fuck this.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.477
Let's clear the area
and go straight to Claire's.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.512
That wasn't part of the plan.

16:20.545 --> 16:22.747
I'm not trusting anything
we had set up with Rex.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.985
Let's get to Claire and
get the fuck out of the city.

- Can we do this in person?
- REX: <i>Where are you?</i>

19:09.974 --> 19:11.776
What the hell happened?

19:11.809 --> 19:13.476
This was a cakewalk.

19:13.510 --> 19:16.147
- In and out in 10.
- <i>Maybe...</i>

19:16.180 --> 19:19.216
Maybe we lost track of a guard.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.052
Bad call,
letting Joe run point.

19:22.086 --> 19:23.820
The guy's a jinx.

19:23.853 --> 19:25.856
You should've let me
buy him out!

19:27.524 --> 19:29.025
<i>It could've been
a solid payday,</i>

19:29.059 --> 19:30.894
instead of this fucking mess
right here.

19:30.927 --> 19:32.195
<i>Security detail changed.</i>

19:32.228 --> 19:34.630
Some civvie
was playing Dirty Harry...

19:34.663 --> 19:37.233
- Where is the rest of the crew?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

19:37.267 --> 19:38.868
Got my bell rung.

19:38.902 --> 19:40.036
<i>You don't know.</i>

19:40.070 --> 19:42.771
That crap ain't gonna cut it.

19:44.106 --> 19:45.942
He's your brother!

19:45.976 --> 19:48.544
This is the kinda shit that
put him away the last time.

19:50.213 --> 19:51.880
Joe's dead.

19:53.581 --> 19:54.682
I'm sorry, Frank.

19:56.252 --> 19:59.088
You know,
this is still business.

20:01.056 --> 20:03.624
What's the rest of the damage?

20:03.658 --> 20:04.792
I don't know
who's still in play.

20:04.826 --> 20:06.795
<i>What is it?</i>

20:06.829 --> 20:08.896
<i>It went straight
by the numbers.</i>

20:08.931 --> 20:11.833
The alarm went off,
and we cleared the vault.

20:14.568 --> 20:15.903
Where's the package?

20:15.938 --> 20:17.005
<i>Joe had it.</i>

20:17.038 --> 20:18.773
Then all hell broke loose.

20:18.806 --> 20:20.975
I got hit in the head
and got knocked out.

20:23.044 --> 20:24.511
How did you get out?

20:26.014 --> 20:29.816
We took the secondary getaway
on Fifth Street.

20:29.850 --> 20:32.552
It doesn't answer my question.
Where's the case?

20:32.586 --> 20:33.820
I don't know, Rex.

20:35.188 --> 20:36.823
Probably whoever hit us has it.

20:36.857 --> 20:38.825
They knew exactly
where we were gonna be,

20:38.859 --> 20:41.194
then they left me there
to take the fall.

20:41.228 --> 20:44.897
It won't take long to ID Joe.

20:44.930 --> 20:46.566
Where are you?

20:46.600 --> 20:48.869
Clearing out of my safe house.

20:48.902 --> 20:50.603
What?

20:50.636 --> 20:52.272
Get to the holdup on Crenshaw.

20:52.305 --> 20:54.206
You were supposed
to do that anyway.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.309
Look, if someone's
setting me up,

20:56.343 --> 20:59.145
then Crenshaw's probably
already compromised.

21:00.813 --> 21:03.848
Get your head on straight.

21:03.882 --> 21:07.119
Call me the second you hear
anything about the case.

21:07.153 --> 21:08.654
<i>You understand that?</i>

21:11.823 --> 21:13.825
[sighs]

21:20.932 --> 21:23.201
I got a guy on vice,
said the bank's a fucking mess.

21:23.234 --> 21:25.136
They shot the place up
pretty bad,

21:25.170 --> 21:27.205
took out a bunch
of damn cops in the process.

21:28.273 --> 21:30.275
None of this
connects back to me.

21:30.308 --> 21:32.043
I'm on it.

21:32.976 --> 21:34.645
Cops aren't holding anyone,

21:34.678 --> 21:36.881
but Joe Sullivan's
on his way to the morgue.

21:36.915 --> 21:39.850
- Where's his brother?
- I just got off with Frank.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.952
It's a rough break,
but he's a pro.

21:41.985 --> 21:43.287
Does he have the case?

21:43.320 --> 21:44.922
He couldn't tell me
a goddamn thing.

21:47.258 --> 21:49.193
This isn't what I signed up for.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.195
You've already made the deal
for the hardware.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.930
Which was contingent on
the acquisition of that case.

21:53.963 --> 21:57.101
Now, without that,
all of this is worthless.

21:57.134 --> 21:59.769
I've never had a job
go down like this.

21:59.802 --> 22:02.705
It wasn't the crew or me.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.374
It was the caper
that went sideways.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.710
Who else was after this thing?

22:07.743 --> 22:09.178
Besides us?

22:09.212 --> 22:11.914
Every law enforcement agency
in the country.

22:57.091 --> 22:59.193
Whiskey, neat.

23:08.768 --> 23:09.969
Mm.

23:11.504 --> 23:13.973
You drinking to forget?

23:14.007 --> 23:15.875
Drinking to my brother.

23:17.877 --> 23:20.246
I'm looking for
his girlfriend Claire.

23:25.985 --> 23:27.753
She's not here.

23:31.790 --> 23:35.827
If she is here,
she's in danger.

23:40.532 --> 23:41.799
Upstairs.

23:43.502 --> 23:45.002
Thanks.

24:09.859 --> 24:12.430
I don't have much cash.
Take it and get the fuck out.

24:12.463 --> 24:14.064
Frank?

24:15.799 --> 24:17.134
Joe's dead.

24:17.168 --> 24:18.436
What?

24:18.469 --> 24:20.470
That can't be right.

24:20.503 --> 24:22.239
Shit.

24:22.272 --> 24:24.974
Supposed to be
a really easy job.

24:25.007 --> 24:26.776
What the hell happened?

24:26.810 --> 24:28.812
Somebody shot him.

24:28.845 --> 24:30.513
What do we do?

24:33.482 --> 24:35.986
I can give you this cash.

24:36.019 --> 24:37.886
For what?

24:37.920 --> 24:42.024
Joey asked me to look out for
you in case shit went wrong.

24:43.992 --> 24:45.427
What happened in there?

24:47.129 --> 24:50.299
I don't know.
I don't know.

24:51.367 --> 24:53.835
I got knocked out.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.036
But you got away.

24:55.069 --> 24:56.804
I woke up next to a Dumpster,

24:56.838 --> 25:00.041
where we parked
the secondary getaway vehicle.

25:00.074 --> 25:01.509
But those ten minutes...

25:03.111 --> 25:04.579
gone.

25:04.612 --> 25:06.315
What were you after?

25:06.348 --> 25:07.282
Money?

25:07.315 --> 25:08.850
Some sort of metal case.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.251
I don't even know
what was inside it.

25:10.285 --> 25:11.452
How can you not know
what's inside?

25:11.486 --> 25:13.854
It was just a job,
all right?

25:13.887 --> 25:16.357
It paid well,
but it was just a job.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.059
It's a bust anyway.
What difference does it make?

25:19.092 --> 25:20.827
It matters to me.

25:20.861 --> 25:23.497
That ten minutes
took away the life we had.

25:24.598 --> 25:26.900
Look, he asked me
to get you out.

25:26.933 --> 25:29.836
I can give you some money,
but we have to go.

25:29.870 --> 25:31.004
Who else was there?

25:31.038 --> 25:32.339
You met them.

25:32.372 --> 25:34.140
There were five of us
on the inside.

25:34.173 --> 25:35.909
One of 'em planned the outs.

25:35.942 --> 25:38.111
The outs?

25:38.145 --> 25:41.881
Escape routes, new identities,
that sort of stuff.

25:41.914 --> 25:44.383
Maybe one of them.
Can't you just...

25:44.417 --> 25:47.086
- We're wasting time.
- What the hell are you doing?

25:47.119 --> 25:49.188
We have to move.
Don't you understand?

25:49.221 --> 25:51.057
It's not safe for you here.

25:51.090 --> 25:52.857
The cops are gonna be after
whoever's close to Joe.

25:52.891 --> 25:54.092
Now put this on.

26:09.007 --> 26:10.241
Is that who I think it is?

26:13.645 --> 26:15.547
Why would Rex
send his cleaner here?

26:15.580 --> 26:17.349
Oh, fuck.

26:17.382 --> 26:19.184
Where's the back door
to this place?

26:19.217 --> 26:21.085
Through there.

26:21.118 --> 26:22.487
We gotta go. Now.

26:27.492 --> 26:30.194
My window to get to Crenshaw
has closed.

26:30.227 --> 26:32.429
Rex must think
I ambushed the deal.

26:32.463 --> 26:34.897
You got someplace else
to go outside of town?

26:34.931 --> 26:36.967
I've got a brother
that lives up in Minnesota.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.503
Good. If anybody asks,
you've been there all week.

26:39.536 --> 26:41.305
Now get in.

26:46.043 --> 26:47.644
- [engine starts]
- Oh, shit, she's back!

26:47.678 --> 26:49.245
Get down, get down!

26:54.517 --> 26:56.185
All right.

27:03.593 --> 27:05.695
I didn't think
it would be so tight.

27:05.728 --> 27:08.231
My out's blown.

27:08.264 --> 27:10.065
We should get outta here.

27:14.669 --> 27:18.073
Tell me we have eyes
on Baxter and Marshall.

27:18.106 --> 27:19.441
Still can't reach anyone,

27:19.474 --> 27:21.076
and Frank hasn't been
to Crenshaw.

27:21.109 --> 27:22.943
Nothing?

27:28.517 --> 27:30.552
From this vantage point,
it looks like the cops

27:30.585 --> 27:33.087
have locked down
about six city blocks,

27:33.120 --> 27:36.224
including
the secondary fallback.

27:37.559 --> 27:40.461
Every cop in the country's
after this thing, right?

27:40.494 --> 27:41.395
Right.

27:42.996 --> 27:45.131
How do we know
they didn't tag the score?

27:45.165 --> 27:46.600
Because if they did,

27:46.634 --> 27:49.236
then I doubt we'd be
standing here right now.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.110
CLAIRE: What is this place?

27:57.143 --> 28:00.447
Joey designed secondary
escape routes for both of us.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.148
His plan was foolproof.

28:02.182 --> 28:04.551
If someone hijacked it,
it was one of us.

28:04.584 --> 28:06.553
So why are we here?

28:06.587 --> 28:08.755
Baxter was one of the guys
covering the lobby

28:08.788 --> 28:10.022
this afternoon.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.424
You think it was him?

28:12.425 --> 28:14.193
He's smarter than he looks.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.095
And he always kept dirt
on everyone.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.630
If this guy killed Joe,

28:17.664 --> 28:19.364
aren't you taking
an awful risk going in alone?

28:19.398 --> 28:21.767
I can handle Baxter.
You stay put.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.035
- Let me come with you.
- Not a chance.

28:24.068 --> 28:26.104
The only reason
I got roped into this

28:26.138 --> 28:27.774
is because Joe needed a score

28:27.807 --> 28:30.175
to prove that
he could still deliver.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.543
Now lock the doors.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.478
Like it's gonna help
in this neighborhood.

30:30.891 --> 30:32.425
- [gun cocks]
- Psst!

30:32.458 --> 30:34.627
Jesus, man!

30:34.660 --> 30:36.095
That sidearm for me?

30:37.263 --> 30:38.799
Just staying safe, man.

30:38.832 --> 30:41.167
How'd I know you weren't
gonna bring the five-oh?

30:42.301 --> 30:43.803
Anyone else here?

30:43.836 --> 30:45.203
No, it's just me, brother.

30:46.372 --> 30:50.643
Hey, I know you weren't tight,
but respects for Joe.

30:50.676 --> 30:53.211
It's all over the news.
We in some gnarly shit, Hoss.

30:54.512 --> 30:56.214
What the hell
happened back there?

30:56.247 --> 30:58.583
- We got a rat in the crew?
- Hey, we cool, man.

30:58.617 --> 30:59.852
I covered my post.

30:59.885 --> 31:01.853
It was all clear
till things went postal.

31:01.886 --> 31:03.788
What happened there
in the vault, huh?

31:03.822 --> 31:06.191
Joey and I were
ahead of the clock.

31:06.224 --> 31:07.826
You were the one
with eyes on Marshall.

31:07.859 --> 31:09.661
You tell me exactly
what you saw.

31:09.694 --> 31:11.796
Sitting on the guards,
when the fireworks started,

31:11.830 --> 31:13.330
you know how he rolls.

31:13.364 --> 31:14.932
Charlie Bronson
had to check it out.

31:14.965 --> 31:16.835
- And Griffin?
- Trolling the security station.

31:16.868 --> 31:18.435
- Then what?
- I got the hell outta Dodge

31:18.469 --> 31:19.703
when the alarms chimed.

31:19.738 --> 31:21.405
Been here ever since.

31:21.438 --> 31:22.740
Griffin was supposed
to kill the alarms.

31:22.773 --> 31:24.875
Yeah, man,
but something tripped.

31:24.908 --> 31:26.710
After all these years,
I dodged every bullet.

31:26.744 --> 31:28.912
I wasn't gonna wait
for no cops.

31:28.946 --> 31:30.914
They were waiting for us
right out front.

31:31.982 --> 31:33.516
Shit! We got heat!

31:34.550 --> 31:37.286
[alarm blaring]

31:37.321 --> 31:39.355
Baxter, it's a setup!
Bring 'em up!

31:44.494 --> 31:45.928
Damn! Let's go!

31:49.265 --> 31:51.199
Keep your faces down!

31:52.735 --> 31:54.536
[gunfire]

32:16.992 --> 32:18.627
We dumped the car
in the river,

32:18.660 --> 32:20.261
and Marsh and I
went separate ways.

32:20.294 --> 32:21.930
I had my eye out
on the ball.

32:21.963 --> 32:24.665
You think Griff
or Marsh made a play?

32:24.699 --> 32:26.735
I won't know that
till I find 'em.

32:27.836 --> 32:29.737
Any idea where they're at?

32:31.906 --> 32:33.941
Can't help you there, dude.

32:33.974 --> 32:36.677
Why you camping here
instead of Crenshaw?

32:36.711 --> 32:38.713
This is my hood.
If we did get punked,

32:38.746 --> 32:40.715
the big kahuna
might send out Ivory,

32:40.748 --> 32:43.650
and I don't wanna be a part
of any of that shit.

32:43.683 --> 32:45.652
[phone chimes]

32:45.685 --> 32:48.655
That's probably Rex's boys
trying to squeeze me to come in.

32:57.430 --> 32:58.765
Shit.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.401
- Who is it?
- [lighter clicking]

33:03.902 --> 33:05.270
Is it Rex?

33:09.441 --> 33:10.743
Sorry, dude.

34:36.891 --> 34:38.359
CLAIRE: Frank!

34:38.393 --> 34:39.962
- [screaming]
- Shut the fuck up, man!

34:39.995 --> 34:41.830
- Shoot him, Frank!
- Shut up.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.498
Drop it or I drop her.

34:45.498 --> 34:47.502
- Hey, Baxter.
- Huh?

34:47.534 --> 34:50.839
- You like dancing?
- What?

34:51.806 --> 34:53.674
Hope not.

34:54.641 --> 34:55.809
Oh, my God!

34:56.777 --> 34:58.847
- Shit.
- Damn it!

34:58.880 --> 35:00.447
Frank, hurry!

35:00.480 --> 35:01.882
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

35:01.915 --> 35:04.818
- I heard shots!
- And what were you gonna do?

35:04.852 --> 35:07.055
- My leg!
- Shut up!

35:07.088 --> 35:09.423
Help him up.
Get up now.

35:09.456 --> 35:12.092
- Help him up.
- Okay, okay.

35:12.125 --> 35:14.460
[grunting]

35:14.493 --> 35:15.828
Let's go, come on.

35:18.098 --> 35:20.133
This was planned to perfection.

35:21.168 --> 35:22.568
It's all there.

35:23.536 --> 35:24.670
Everything.

35:25.771 --> 35:27.673
I gave you the best crew
money can buy.

35:27.707 --> 35:30.042
It's just a simple
fucking bank job,

35:30.076 --> 35:31.744
if you know what you're doing.

35:31.777 --> 35:34.080
Not just one bank.

35:34.113 --> 35:38.484
One branch, one location,
one vault.

35:39.819 --> 35:41.686
So why did we break into it?

35:43.622 --> 35:47.759
Twelve years ago, there was
this world-famous jewel thief

35:47.792 --> 35:49.794
that stole what was
equivalent today

35:49.828 --> 35:51.663
to 30 million
in raw gemstones.

35:55.499 --> 35:57.969
Now, his fence
was told to stash it

35:58.003 --> 36:01.172
in one of those
safety deposit boxes,

36:01.206 --> 36:03.507
pending the sale of the merch.

36:08.479 --> 36:10.714
When the fence was killed for
shopping around the jewels...

36:15.685 --> 36:18.155
the thief fled
to a non-extradition country.

36:20.224 --> 36:21.225
Why now?

36:22.993 --> 36:25.461
The Mann Chandler Bank
was flooded a few weeks ago

36:25.495 --> 36:27.932
when the Ohio River overflowed.

36:27.965 --> 36:29.732
Now, their customers
were told to come in

36:29.766 --> 36:31.668
and collect their property,

36:31.701 --> 36:33.836
or their safety deposit boxes
would be moved

36:33.870 --> 36:35.771
to a different location.

36:35.804 --> 36:38.841
Now, I was hired to bring in
the best crew to retrieve that,

36:38.875 --> 36:41.878
since he couldn't
step foot onto U.S. soil.

36:41.911 --> 36:43.879
Who else knows about this?

36:43.912 --> 36:45.681
Look, I hired you
because I was told

36:45.714 --> 36:47.083
you didn't ask those questions.

36:47.116 --> 36:49.886
Your job was to tell
the fucking truth!

36:51.154 --> 36:52.721
Look, I can't wait any longer.

36:52.754 --> 36:54.856
Now, I know you and Frank
are tight and all,

36:54.890 --> 36:58.894
but that case
buys a lot of loyalty.

36:58.927 --> 37:00.228
But even more favors.

37:00.262 --> 37:03.664
He never gave me a reason
to doubt before.

37:03.698 --> 37:08.136
Everyone's got their price,
even Frank Sullivan.

37:08.170 --> 37:11.839
And everyone's an asset,
until they're not.

37:18.746 --> 37:20.982
[groans]
Take it easy!

37:21.015 --> 37:23.284
Give me the real
or the next one's in your gut.

37:23.317 --> 37:25.919
I didn't do it, man.
We got history, I swear.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.588
Then why did you try to kill me?

37:27.621 --> 37:29.924
The alarm wasn't my fault,
man, okay?

37:31.058 --> 37:33.093
Griff got antsy.
When the shooting started,

37:33.126 --> 37:35.662
I followed Marshall
out the door.

37:35.695 --> 37:38.832
M-Maybe we missed a teller
or a civvie had a phone.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.767
It just happened so fast.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.169
Marshall was pinned down,
gunning away.

37:43.203 --> 37:45.771
I got a few shots off.

37:45.804 --> 37:47.841
I thought if he can make it out,
so can all of us.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.609
Bullshit.

37:49.642 --> 37:50.844
- [click]
- God!

37:50.877 --> 37:52.045
Where's Griffin?

37:52.078 --> 37:54.146
I don't know, I don't know.

37:54.179 --> 37:55.581
[click]

37:55.614 --> 37:57.884
God!
I swear it's all I know.

37:57.917 --> 37:59.585
Did he hijack us?

38:00.919 --> 38:02.254
No, man.

38:02.287 --> 38:04.056
One out of four.
That's all you got left.

38:04.089 --> 38:05.857
When the alarm went off,
I got the hell out.

38:05.890 --> 38:08.127
You know
I'm no good to you dead.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.661
CLAIRE: I don't believe him.

38:09.695 --> 38:10.929
What's with her?

38:10.963 --> 38:13.132
You don't remember Claire?

38:13.165 --> 38:15.767
Claire, you remember Baxter,
don't you?

38:15.800 --> 38:18.103
Of course I do. Hardest part
about working in a bar

38:18.137 --> 38:21.572
is figuring out who's drunk
and who's just stupid.

38:21.606 --> 38:22.874
Tell us where they are,

38:22.907 --> 38:24.942
or I'll blow another hole
in you.

38:26.778 --> 38:28.112
It's too late, bro.

38:28.146 --> 38:30.081
They're probably
in the wind already.

38:32.350 --> 38:33.617
[click]

38:33.650 --> 38:34.718
Fuck!

38:34.751 --> 38:36.821
Where's Marshall?

38:36.854 --> 38:39.357
The guy's no sucker.
If you want to find him,

38:39.390 --> 38:41.192
he's probably
where he's always at.

38:41.225 --> 38:42.926
How about Griffin?

38:42.959 --> 38:45.829
I'd be surprised
if he's still in the state.

38:46.863 --> 38:48.232
[Claire shouting]

38:49.300 --> 38:51.034
[click]

38:55.971 --> 38:57.674
That was close.

38:57.707 --> 38:59.309
Let's go.

39:04.747 --> 39:06.715
CLAIRE: What the hell
is going on, Frank?

39:06.749 --> 39:08.684
Someone's playing me.

39:08.717 --> 39:09.852
You heard what he said.

39:09.885 --> 39:12.388
Yeah, and I don't buy it.

39:12.421 --> 39:15.057
If Marshall killed Joe,
he could shoot you too, right?

39:15.091 --> 39:16.959
[sighs]
I don't know.

39:16.992 --> 39:18.661
It's all a blur.

39:18.694 --> 39:20.096
I don't know what happened
when I was out,

39:20.129 --> 39:22.897
but when I came to,
Joey was already...

39:23.865 --> 39:24.899
He was what?

39:25.934 --> 39:27.136
He was gone.

39:28.170 --> 39:29.405
Did he say anything?

39:29.438 --> 39:30.839
No.

39:32.307 --> 39:34.375
But he did ask me
to get you out

39:34.409 --> 39:36.744
if something happened to him.

39:36.778 --> 39:39.347
He really looked up to you.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.328
CLAIRE: What the hell
is this place?

39:54.361 --> 39:56.263
FRANK: They call it
the Raw Deal.

39:56.296 --> 39:58.765
High stakes, no rules.

39:58.799 --> 40:01.168
They pay the police
to turn a blind eye.

40:01.201 --> 40:03.936
If Marshall's still here,
this is where he'll be.

40:05.371 --> 40:08.741
You wouldn't have another one
of those for me, would you?

40:08.774 --> 40:09.876
Yeah.

40:09.909 --> 40:12.078
You take the driver's seat.

40:12.111 --> 40:14.847
If he is still here, we might
need to leave in a hurry,

40:14.881 --> 40:16.816
so be ready to rock and roll.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.251
Got it.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.819
DOORMAN: Hey, Frankie,
how's it going?

40:19.852 --> 40:21.821
How's it going, bro?
You all right?

40:21.854 --> 40:23.889
Marshall upstairs?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.024
- Up there playing.
- Cool.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.439
[soft chatter]

40:47.145 --> 40:48.947
Need any drinks here?

40:51.116 --> 40:52.317
Thanks.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.360
Thanks, baby.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.162
Hey, I'll take care
of you later, okay?

41:07.198 --> 41:09.300
20 more to you, sir.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.902
- 20.
- 20?

41:15.305 --> 41:17.208
I'm all in. Come on.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.876
- I call.
- What have you got?

41:23.313 --> 41:25.814
All the way
down the hole here.

41:25.847 --> 41:26.950
Beginner's luck.

41:26.983 --> 41:28.451
Pair of jacks.

41:28.484 --> 41:30.887
- Kings and jacks.
- Read 'em and weep.

41:34.890 --> 41:37.160
Ah, sorry about that.

41:37.193 --> 41:38.361
Beginner's luck.

41:39.329 --> 41:40.862
Hold up.

41:42.497 --> 41:43.899
What do you got?

41:44.933 --> 41:46.368
Three 10s.

41:46.401 --> 41:47.903
Winner.

41:47.936 --> 41:49.438
What, are you two guys
working together?

41:49.471 --> 41:51.906
Hey, don't be a sore loser,
all right?

41:57.212 --> 41:59.047
Come on.
What's wrong with all of you?

41:59.081 --> 42:00.482
All you fishes done for the day?

42:00.515 --> 42:02.750
Who's next?
I'm bulletproof, baby!

42:06.087 --> 42:07.155
Hello, Marshall.

42:07.189 --> 42:08.923
Frank.

42:08.956 --> 42:11.158
That was some
fucked-up shit today.

42:11.192 --> 42:14.094
[chuckles]
Goddamn right.

42:14.127 --> 42:15.795
And here you are playing cards

42:15.829 --> 42:17.965
like you got
a pretty sweet hand.

42:17.999 --> 42:22.168
- Ah!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:22.202 --> 42:23.270
Easy.

42:25.305 --> 42:28.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy, easy.

42:28.242 --> 42:29.909
Easy.

42:34.180 --> 42:35.147
Easy.

42:36.516 --> 42:38.985
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

42:40.153 --> 42:41.521
I got your attention now?

42:45.457 --> 42:48.194
Why you fucking with
my sunny disposition, Frank?

42:48.228 --> 42:50.329
[chuckles]

42:50.362 --> 42:53.332
Everybody,
calm the fuck down!

42:53.365 --> 42:55.567
Jesus!

42:55.601 --> 42:57.836
Would you guys relax?
Relax, okay?

42:57.870 --> 43:01.273
Put the guns down.
Just talking here.

43:03.875 --> 43:06.879
See, these are my boys, Frank.

43:07.912 --> 43:09.180
These are my boys.

43:09.214 --> 43:11.015
And they've always been my out,

43:11.049 --> 43:13.017
and if you ask
any single one of them,

43:13.051 --> 43:14.619
they'll tell you
the exact same thing.

43:14.652 --> 43:16.954
That I've been here all day,

43:18.056 --> 43:20.325
that I won some,

43:20.358 --> 43:21.992
I lost some,

43:23.226 --> 43:25.262
but I'm still ahead of the game.

43:25.295 --> 43:29.066
I'm still ahead of the game.
What's your alibi?

43:29.100 --> 43:32.135
I been busy hunting down
you sons of bitches.

43:32.169 --> 43:34.104
Now where's that goddamn case?

43:34.137 --> 43:36.105
Hey, I held up my end.

43:36.139 --> 43:38.442
No, that's not how
Baxter tells it.

43:39.677 --> 43:41.611
[laughs]
Baxter?

43:41.645 --> 43:44.980
Baxter waited till the end
to show his rat-ass face,

43:45.014 --> 43:46.515
and I got the scars to prove it.

43:46.549 --> 43:47.984
You left your post.

43:48.018 --> 43:50.354
I had those guards
wrapped tight.

43:50.387 --> 43:53.189
Swept the lobby two times.
Two times, Frank.

43:53.222 --> 43:54.957
And you and Joe
are running long,

43:54.990 --> 43:57.093
and before I know it,
two cops are in my eyeline.

43:57.126 --> 43:59.328
- [gunshot]
- [alarm blaring]

44:53.045 --> 44:55.581
And I went out first because
those two fucking pussies

44:55.615 --> 44:57.084
couldn't hold their own.

44:59.218 --> 45:01.354
Who tripped the alarm?
The guard?

45:01.387 --> 45:02.722
Someone from the bank?

45:02.756 --> 45:04.724
I didn't miss
no motherfucking guards.

45:04.757 --> 45:07.494
What kinda Mickey Mouse job did
you and your brother cook up?

45:09.061 --> 45:10.196
Joe's dead.

45:11.497 --> 45:12.598
Oh.

45:13.866 --> 45:17.003
Well, then Griffin's laughing
his way to Mexico right now.

45:18.037 --> 45:20.071
- Griffin?
- Yeah, Griffin.

45:20.105 --> 45:22.675
That cocksucker showed up
when the shitstorm went down.

45:22.708 --> 45:24.709
Now I figured he was
just sick of waiting too.

45:24.743 --> 45:26.711
But as soon as
the alarm went off,

45:26.745 --> 45:28.714
he busted ass
right after you and Joe.

45:28.748 --> 45:30.415
- [alarm blaring]
- Keep your heads down!

45:30.449 --> 45:33.050
[alarm continues]

45:35.687 --> 45:38.623
And now I take this thing,

45:38.657 --> 45:40.659
with no payoff,

45:40.692 --> 45:44.161
and Griffin's playing us
like a bunch of chumps,

45:44.195 --> 45:46.664
and you're in here
trying to take care of me?

45:49.266 --> 45:51.435
You couldn't take care
of a two-dollar whore,

45:51.469 --> 45:54.472
you or your dead
fucking brother!

45:55.739 --> 45:58.242
Keep talking shit
about my brother.

45:58.275 --> 46:01.545
I'll blow a hole in that nasty
little fuckin' mouth of yours.

46:05.381 --> 46:09.487
Me and my boys had plans
after this, Frank.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.120
And now...

46:12.355 --> 46:16.158
we are going to have
to take it out on you.

46:42.551 --> 46:44.753
Go! Go, go, go!

46:44.786 --> 46:46.053
[tires squealing]

46:46.087 --> 46:48.290
Get up! Get 'em!
Come on!

46:51.559 --> 46:53.828
Oh, my God!
What happened back there?

46:53.861 --> 46:55.263
[gunfire continues]

46:56.664 --> 46:58.332
Are you okay?

46:58.366 --> 47:00.368
They're fuckin' dead!

47:00.401 --> 47:02.370
Come on! Fuck!

47:02.403 --> 47:04.705
Get up. Come on, grab the cash.
Let's get outta here.

47:12.612 --> 47:14.214
Come on, come on!

47:14.247 --> 47:16.650
Hello, boys.

47:16.683 --> 47:19.452
Haven't heard from you,
Marshall.

47:19.486 --> 47:22.222
Must've got lost
on your way to the Crenshaw.

47:24.256 --> 47:26.358
Yeah, we were just
heading there.

47:26.392 --> 47:29.195
Little late for that now,
don't you think?

47:31.631 --> 47:33.365
Fuck!

47:36.368 --> 47:38.370
Doesn't have to go down
this way, Ivory.

47:38.404 --> 47:40.673
That depends on you.

47:40.706 --> 47:43.175
- Anything yet?
- Nothing.

47:43.208 --> 47:46.544
[phone vibrating]

47:46.578 --> 47:48.614
IVORY: <i>I've got eyes
on Marshall.</i>

47:48.647 --> 47:50.349
Where was he?

47:50.382 --> 47:52.250
Holed up
down at the Raw Deal.

47:52.283 --> 47:55.587
Thought he was covering
his tracks with five-oh.

47:55.620 --> 47:57.456
Hey, that's not
what was going on.

47:57.489 --> 47:58.824
We were just playing it cool.

47:58.857 --> 48:01.259
Did you hear that?

48:01.292 --> 48:03.127
Yeah, let's just
keep this simple.

48:03.161 --> 48:04.329
Go ahead.

48:04.362 --> 48:05.897
IVORY: <i>He's all ears.</i>

48:05.930 --> 48:07.465
MARSHALL: <i>Look, man...</i>

48:07.498 --> 48:09.400
I don't care
what you have to say.

48:09.434 --> 48:11.569
Who's got the case?

48:11.603 --> 48:13.270
Baxter and Joe are dead.

48:13.303 --> 48:14.872
Me and Frank
don't have the case.

48:14.906 --> 48:17.375
<i>That means Griffin
did a snatch and grab.</i>

48:17.408 --> 48:18.810
You sure about that?

48:18.843 --> 48:20.745
Yeah, I busted my ass
to get out of there.

48:20.778 --> 48:22.846
<i>Cops were out front,
the alarm went off,</i>

48:22.879 --> 48:24.448
shit was fucking haywire,
all right?

48:24.481 --> 48:26.516
Nothing went according to plan.

48:29.186 --> 48:31.221
All the pieces were in position.

48:31.254 --> 48:32.288
That's all I know.

48:33.557 --> 48:35.791
Then I guess your markers
are getting called in.

48:42.298 --> 48:43.532
<i>Marker called.</i>

48:43.566 --> 48:45.334
Do you have any tracking
on Frank?

48:45.368 --> 48:47.370
I had eyes on him earlier.

48:47.403 --> 48:50.139
He's got someone with him,
a girl.

48:51.307 --> 48:52.541
Sanitize the site,

48:52.575 --> 48:55.210
so you can
lead this to the case.

48:55.243 --> 48:56.645
I'm on it.

49:18.500 --> 49:20.335
Cops still don't know anything.

49:20.368 --> 49:22.369
They're scrambling
all over the city.

49:22.403 --> 49:26.407
Anyone else think
this isn't a big coincidence?

49:27.909 --> 49:29.778
Joe comes to town.

49:30.879 --> 49:32.379
Now half the crew's dead,

49:33.380 --> 49:34.715
and Frank's MIA?

49:36.349 --> 49:38.485
[phone vibrates]

49:41.021 --> 49:42.690
- Is that Ivory?
- Doesn't say.

49:42.723 --> 49:44.691
Let's play it back on this.

49:44.724 --> 49:47.661
ROBOTIC VOICE: <i>Follow these
directions carefully.</i>

49:47.695 --> 49:50.229
<i>Case is secure.</i>

49:50.263 --> 49:52.732
<i>Same deal as before.</i>

49:52.765 --> 49:54.934
<i>$500,000.</i>

49:56.301 --> 49:58.571
<i>10 p.m.</i>

49:58.604 --> 50:02.441
- <i>Place, TBD.</i>
- <i>[beeps]</i>

50:03.743 --> 50:05.911
Things are getting out of hand.

50:05.944 --> 50:08.681
It's time to wipe
the board clean.

50:08.715 --> 50:10.282
Liquidate everyone.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.862
CLAIRE: Joe and I came up here
all the time.

50:23.895 --> 50:25.931
You can see the whole city
from here.

50:27.999 --> 50:30.334
It's a different kinda jungle.

50:31.635 --> 50:34.271
This city hasn't worked out
like I planned, but...

50:35.506 --> 50:36.974
I don't quit easy.

50:40.811 --> 50:43.614
You don't seem like the guy
your brother told me about.

50:45.582 --> 50:49.687
Reputations have a way
of opening and closing doors.

50:49.720 --> 50:52.857
I was done way before
ever taking this one on.

50:52.890 --> 50:55.558
You really didn't know
what you were stealing?

50:55.592 --> 50:58.528
It's better that way.
Cleaner.

51:00.730 --> 51:02.565
Joe said we'd be set.

51:02.599 --> 51:05.034
Must be pretty big
for all this heat.

51:06.002 --> 51:07.637
He was betting it all.

51:07.670 --> 51:10.540
He never listened to a word
I ever said.

51:12.574 --> 51:15.511
He couldn't have gotten on this
if you hadn't vouched for him.

51:15.544 --> 51:17.781
That's because he spent
seven years in the joint

51:17.814 --> 51:19.615
for a job he did in Phoenix.

51:20.917 --> 51:23.585
No one would touch him
after that.

51:23.619 --> 51:25.587
He just wanted
to be his own man.

51:25.621 --> 51:27.957
And he was desperate.
He needed this.

51:27.991 --> 51:30.359
Thing I don't understand is...

51:30.392 --> 51:32.895
I've done over a dozen
of these jobs with Rex.

51:32.928 --> 51:36.330
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

51:36.364 --> 51:39.600
It must've been Griffin
on the double-cross.

51:39.635 --> 51:42.737
It's a pretty good way
to avoid splitting the take.

51:43.738 --> 51:45.472
Griff doesn't take chances.

51:46.741 --> 51:50.478
He'd be on his way
out of town by now.

51:50.511 --> 51:54.314
And there's only one guy who
knows how to get him a new ID.

51:55.149 --> 51:57.485
[engine starts]

52:00.620 --> 52:02.589
WOMAN: Yeah, is that
what it is, huh?

52:02.622 --> 52:04.391
'Cause these tits were good
enough for you last night

52:04.424 --> 52:05.525
when I threw you $50.

52:05.559 --> 52:07.694
Hey, I paid for the room
in full!

52:07.728 --> 52:10.097
- Not the whole night, darling.
- Oh, yeah? Was it?

52:10.131 --> 52:11.865
- Time's up. Get outta here.
- You got a problem with that?

52:11.898 --> 52:13.767
Time's up! Get outta here!

52:13.800 --> 52:14.901
Cocksucker.

52:16.902 --> 52:19.506
Hold it with that,
tough guy.

52:22.008 --> 52:24.376
- Hi.
- Rooms are 69 a night

52:24.410 --> 52:25.811
or 20 bucks an hour.

52:25.845 --> 52:28.048
I appreciate that,

52:28.081 --> 52:30.050
but I really need
to find my brother.

52:30.083 --> 52:31.984
He's supposed to be
staying here.

52:32.017 --> 52:33.886
You see, he's gotten himself
into a bit of trouble and...

52:33.919 --> 52:37.056
Love to help you, darling,
but lots of people come and go.

52:37.089 --> 52:38.858
I think what the lady's
trying to say is

52:38.891 --> 52:40.559
he'd be here to see the doc.

52:41.626 --> 52:42.660
The doc.

52:44.495 --> 52:45.697
[sighs]

52:45.730 --> 52:47.933
Did he have an appointment?

52:47.967 --> 52:50.702
[scoffs]
He doesn't make appointments.

52:50.735 --> 52:52.937
And you already knew that.

52:52.971 --> 52:55.006
He don't take
credit cards either.

52:56.607 --> 53:00.645
Well, fortunately for us,
I brought cash.

53:00.678 --> 53:02.180
All right.

53:02.213 --> 53:04.648
Rate is $500
for an operating room.

53:21.198 --> 53:25.668
Doc's been a bit busy today.
I need you to stay in room 307

53:25.701 --> 53:27.671
till his assistant
comes and get you.

53:29.773 --> 53:31.774
- You got cameras in every room?
- Wait a minute.

53:31.807 --> 53:35.077
Now, that would violate
our clients' privacy, right?

53:38.781 --> 53:39.916
CLAIRE: Oh, my God!

53:44.552 --> 53:46.588
What the hell?

53:46.621 --> 53:49.491
I don't walk into a room unless
I know how I'm getting out.

53:54.663 --> 53:57.732
Room 309 and 311.
Let's go.

54:18.286 --> 54:20.888
- Step back.
- What if they start shooting?

54:22.690 --> 54:24.725
Hey, Griff, that you?

54:24.758 --> 54:26.659
What do you think you're doing?
You can't come in like this.

54:26.693 --> 54:29.196
Take it easy with that, man.
I don't even know you.

54:30.164 --> 54:31.597
Hold this.

54:31.631 --> 54:33.167
What do you want me
to do with this?

54:33.200 --> 54:34.934
- Watch the door.
- Okay.

54:34.968 --> 54:37.136
Busy day for you, huh?

54:37.170 --> 54:38.839
For you or for me?

54:38.872 --> 54:40.940
It's pretty quiet.
Kinda dead, actually.

54:40.974 --> 54:43.009
[chuckles]

54:43.042 --> 54:44.877
Friend of mine
took a slug earlier.

54:44.911 --> 54:46.545
Maybe you worked on him?

54:46.578 --> 54:48.548
A lot of people come in here.

54:48.581 --> 54:50.616
I just do my job.
I don't ask questions.

54:50.650 --> 54:51.651
Griffin O'Brien.

54:51.684 --> 54:53.252
Tall guy, kinda handsome?

54:53.286 --> 54:56.154
Yeah. Yeah, he said
it was ricochet.

54:56.188 --> 54:57.523
Where is he?

54:57.557 --> 54:59.192
You know I can't tell you that.

54:59.225 --> 55:00.259
Yeah?

55:04.997 --> 55:06.198
Eyes on him.

55:06.231 --> 55:09.268
- Hands up.
- Just be cool.

55:09.302 --> 55:12.004
He said if I disturbed him,
he'd shoot me.

55:12.037 --> 55:14.905
Then you better pray that
he's not feeling trigger-happy.

55:14.939 --> 55:17.074
Now open that goddamn door.

55:19.745 --> 55:20.979
[keys jingling]

55:21.013 --> 55:23.214
Mr. O'Brien?

55:23.248 --> 55:26.750
It's Dr. White.
I'd like to check your bandage.

55:26.784 --> 55:28.519
FRANK: Open it.

55:35.658 --> 55:36.793
Goddamn it.

55:36.826 --> 55:39.030
Gone with the wind.

55:39.063 --> 55:40.998
- Where?
- He got winged pretty bad.

55:41.032 --> 55:42.699
It took me two hours
to patch him up.

55:42.732 --> 55:44.200
No, no, no!

55:44.234 --> 55:46.236
I don't give a shit
what condition he was in.

55:46.269 --> 55:49.206
There's only a half a dozen
of you assholes in this city,

55:49.240 --> 55:51.975
but you were the only one
who could provide a new out.

55:52.008 --> 55:53.276
CLAIRE: Frank!

55:53.309 --> 55:54.643
Hold on!

55:54.676 --> 55:56.678
[gunshots]

55:56.712 --> 55:57.781
Come on.

55:59.682 --> 56:01.750
- Jesus.
- What did you do?

56:01.784 --> 56:04.320
CLAIRE: He went for a gun.
I had to shoot him.

56:06.688 --> 56:08.058
I'm sorry.

56:11.693 --> 56:13.595
He had nothing to do
with you people.

56:14.729 --> 56:17.833
All right, enough games.
Where'd he go?

56:17.866 --> 56:20.035
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

56:22.137 --> 56:23.938
Is that right?

56:23.971 --> 56:25.840
We'll just see about that.

56:26.874 --> 56:28.676
Sit down.

56:28.709 --> 56:29.944
Sit down!

56:34.749 --> 56:35.983
Put the mask on him.

56:38.420 --> 56:40.054
Turn it on.

56:40.088 --> 56:42.123
That's it.
Now, nice deep breath, Doc.

56:43.957 --> 56:45.625
[coughs]

56:49.863 --> 56:51.898
You know why I'm here.

57:02.909 --> 57:04.710
Two inches thick!

57:17.423 --> 57:18.757
There you go.

57:18.791 --> 57:20.659
That's it. Now...

57:20.693 --> 57:22.728
I'm gonna ask again,
and you're gonna answer

57:22.761 --> 57:24.096
'cause, as we both know,

57:24.130 --> 57:26.164
if we don't stop
pumping this with oxygen,

57:26.198 --> 57:29.667
you're gonna hallucinate like
a son of a bitch before you die.

57:29.702 --> 57:30.768
Now, where is he?

57:41.713 --> 57:43.815
- Where is he?
- [Doc groans]

57:43.848 --> 57:46.417
- Where? Where?
- Hold still.

57:46.451 --> 57:48.052
I sent him to Montreal!

57:48.086 --> 57:50.221
Montreal? Bullshit!

57:50.255 --> 57:51.289
[screams]

57:51.322 --> 57:52.689
Where is he?

57:57.194 --> 57:58.929
What's that? Shit.

58:00.198 --> 58:03.433
You see that woman?
You know who she is?

58:03.467 --> 58:05.269
You better start talking,

58:05.302 --> 58:08.105
or I guarantee you
she's gonna turn you inside out

58:08.138 --> 58:09.740
before she kills you.

58:09.773 --> 58:11.008
Montreal.

58:11.041 --> 58:12.209
Fuck it. Put it back on.

58:12.242 --> 58:14.143
No!
[groaning]

58:19.316 --> 58:20.816
Montreal!

58:20.850 --> 58:22.151
What?

58:22.185 --> 58:24.754
The train to Montreal
stops in Toronto.

58:24.787 --> 58:26.755
After that, he's on his own.

58:26.788 --> 58:29.292
CLAIRE: The train for Montreal
stops in Toronto.

58:33.462 --> 58:35.797
Come on.
We gotta get outta here.

58:38.968 --> 58:41.237
Good luck, Doc.
Let's go.

58:51.313 --> 58:53.014
This way.

58:53.048 --> 58:56.318
There's a fire escape
through here. Come on.

59:00.821 --> 59:03.857
We gotta get as far away
from this place as we can.

59:04.925 --> 59:06.227
Come on.

59:08.096 --> 59:12.433
[heartbeats]

59:30.451 --> 59:31.784
No, wait.

59:37.055 --> 59:38.492
[phone vibrates]

59:38.525 --> 59:40.393
Talk to me.

59:40.426 --> 59:43.162
Looks like our boy Frank
might've been right.

59:43.196 --> 59:45.931
The doc did a patch job
on Griffin and sent him packing.

59:45.964 --> 59:47.199
Where?

59:47.232 --> 59:50.869
Train to Montreal,
boards 10:00.

59:50.902 --> 59:54.805
What? No matter what happens,
Griffin doesn't make that train.

59:54.839 --> 59:56.341
<i>Fuck him!</i>

59:57.542 --> 01:00:00.412
Hey, you need to go
send someone to intercept.

01:00:00.445 --> 01:00:02.080
He's left the underground.

01:00:02.114 --> 01:00:04.148
No way Frank's gonna
catch him anytime.

01:00:05.182 --> 01:00:06.884
We are totally off plan here.

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:08.587
I'm not comfortable
with any of this.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:12.356
There's always a degree of risk
when the stakes are high.

01:00:13.324 --> 01:00:15.359
This is making me insane.

01:00:15.393 --> 01:00:19.230
Go to the bar downstairs
and have a few drinks.

01:00:19.263 --> 01:00:23.167
Tequila. Try tequila.
It'll calm you right down.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.435
That's what you need.

01:00:33.443 --> 01:00:36.413
[phone vibrating]

01:00:36.446 --> 01:00:40.183
HANNAH: <i>You are
all over the news, Richard.</i>

01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:43.086
This isn't
what you promised us.

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:45.355
<i>Look, we've got
bigger problems than that.</i>

01:00:46.389 --> 01:00:48.325
<i>You know that if the FBI</i>

01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:50.427
<i>figures out
what we were after,</i>

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.463
every one of us will be
on their most-wanted list.

01:00:54.496 --> 01:00:58.134
Look, our middle man is starting
to ask too many damn questions.

01:00:58.168 --> 01:01:00.202
<i>Tell him what he wants to hear,</i>

01:01:00.235 --> 01:01:03.472
just as long as he
completes the job.

01:01:03.505 --> 01:01:05.174
I think someone
from his crew is angling

01:01:05.207 --> 01:01:06.941
trying to get a payday
on this thing.

01:01:06.974 --> 01:01:08.377
<i>Then what do we need him for?</i>

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:11.146
Clock is ticking.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.882
Make the deal
with whoever has it.

01:01:14.916 --> 01:01:16.317
Right.

01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:19.154
And you'll live
to steal another day.

01:01:29.664 --> 01:01:31.566
MAN ON P.A.:
<i>Your Cincinnati rep</i>

01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:36.336
<i>reminds you that all premises
are nonsmoking areas.</i>

01:01:49.383 --> 01:01:51.118
<i>The Cincinnati
Police Department</i>

01:01:51.151 --> 01:01:53.453
<i>reminds you to keep
your luggage with you.</i>

01:01:53.487 --> 01:01:56.255
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

01:01:56.288 --> 01:01:58.924
Like you can search
this whole station by yourself.

01:01:58.959 --> 01:02:01.595
Not that you'd listen.

01:02:01.628 --> 01:02:05.030
Who knew so many people
still took the train?

01:02:05.064 --> 01:02:08.167
CLAIRE: Didn't he say
his destination's for Toronto?

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.936
It's a stopover
on his way to Montreal.

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:13.272
These are all end of the line.

01:02:13.305 --> 01:02:15.641
The next one
leaves in an hour.

01:02:15.674 --> 01:02:17.475
Platform four.

01:02:17.509 --> 01:02:19.245
Over there.

01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:22.247
<i>Cardinal line
now arriving on track three.</i>

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.048
See these folks?

01:02:24.082 --> 01:02:27.419
Employees get to ride for free.
No more paper trail.

01:02:29.422 --> 01:02:31.289
If Griffin wanted to blend in,

01:02:31.322 --> 01:02:33.091
all he'd have to do
is get one of those uniforms.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.361
Oh, shit.

01:02:37.394 --> 01:02:39.197
What if he's already
on the train?

01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:41.166
No. It's way too early.

01:02:41.199 --> 01:02:43.535
He'd jump on
at the last minute.

01:02:44.769 --> 01:02:46.370
I got an idea.

01:02:48.038 --> 01:02:49.541
- I'm sorry...
- Excuse me!

01:02:49.574 --> 01:02:51.341
CLAIRE: It's important.

01:03:09.058 --> 01:03:11.060
Excuse me,
I really need your help.

01:03:11.093 --> 01:03:14.330
My son just got away from me,
and I don't know where he went.

01:03:14.363 --> 01:03:16.432
I lost my son.
I can't find him.

01:03:16.466 --> 01:03:18.702
His name is Griffin.
He's eight years old.

01:03:18.735 --> 01:03:21.170
Calm down and tell me
where you saw him last.

01:03:24.674 --> 01:03:26.575
He's wearing jeans
and a blue jacket.

01:03:43.358 --> 01:03:44.593
He was over there.

01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:46.360
Okay.

01:03:48.129 --> 01:03:50.164
ATTENDANT: <i>May I have
your attention, please?</i>

01:03:50.198 --> 01:03:52.132
<i>We're looking
for an eight-year-old boy</i>

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:54.435
<i>wearing jeans
and a blue jacket.</i>

01:03:54.468 --> 01:03:56.537
<i>His name is Griffin,</i>

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:58.138
<i>and his mother
is waiting for him</i>

01:03:58.172 --> 01:03:59.507
<i>at the information desk.</i>

01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:00.574
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:04:03.777 --> 01:04:06.279
I got you,
you son of a bitch.

01:04:12.486 --> 01:04:14.387
Oh, there he is.
I see him.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.122
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:04:19.325 --> 01:04:22.295
Ladies' room. Move.

01:04:25.498 --> 01:04:26.533
Don't say a word.

01:04:28.101 --> 01:04:30.570
Let's keep it simple
this time.

01:04:30.603 --> 01:04:32.472
Ivory, you got the wrong idea.

01:04:32.505 --> 01:04:35.474
Really? 'Cause I saw
what you did to Baxter.

01:04:35.507 --> 01:04:39.244
You made quite a mess,
and I had to torch the place,

01:04:39.278 --> 01:04:41.681
and now Rex is in a real jam
because of you.

01:04:41.714 --> 01:04:43.448
I got cracked in the skull.

01:04:43.482 --> 01:04:46.518
Do you know how crazy
that shit sounds, Frank?

01:04:46.552 --> 01:04:49.254
Straight up, you thought
you'd get away with it?

01:04:49.288 --> 01:04:51.256
[phone vibrating]

01:04:52.491 --> 01:04:54.860
ROBOTIC VOICE:
<i>Meet at platform seven.</i>

01:04:54.893 --> 01:04:56.794
<i>Union Station.</i>

01:04:56.827 --> 01:05:02.333
<i>If you're not there with
the 500,000 in 30 minutes,</i>

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:05.570
<i>the case leaves with me.</i>

01:05:05.603 --> 01:05:06.637
[beep]

01:05:13.878 --> 01:05:16.112
I can't believe
you're considering this.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.316
What other option
do you think we have?

01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:21.384
Have you ever considered
that we could be getting set up?

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:23.253
That could be the feds
for all we know.

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:26.189
I doubt the feds
are really that smart.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.458
[phone vibrating]

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:31.194

Frank Sullivan</i>

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:32.829
<i>standing in front of me.</i>

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:35.531
We're at the station.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:43.873
You're on speaker.

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:45.841
You didn't report in.

01:05:45.874 --> 01:05:48.344
Now you're taking down
your own guys?

01:05:49.411 --> 01:05:51.780
One of us is bad,
and it ain't me.

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:54.917
I'm just trying
to get even for Joe,

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.919
get back what we set out for.

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:59.722
<i>No, you're passing the buck
when you screw up.</i>

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:02.925
<i>Even if you're being straight,
it was my crew.</i>

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:05.627
It didn't go down that way.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.795
Come clean,
or Ivory's gonna take you apart,

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:09.397
piece by piece.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.734
<i>I don't wanna see that.</i>

01:06:12.767 --> 01:06:14.502
Look, Griff has it.

01:06:14.535 --> 01:06:17.270
It has to be him.
He's the only one left.

01:06:17.304 --> 01:06:20.541
I had eyes on him until
your cleaner brought me in here.

01:06:21.743 --> 01:06:23.343
Check his burner.

01:06:27.914 --> 01:06:29.182
Got it.

01:06:29.216 --> 01:06:31.585
Check the last message he sent.

01:06:33.754 --> 01:06:34.821
Nothing.

01:06:34.855 --> 01:06:36.456
If I don't get the goods,

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:39.760
I have no problem walking away
with loose ends.

01:06:39.793 --> 01:06:41.862
That means you and your girl.

01:06:41.895 --> 01:06:44.563
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:45.698 --> 01:06:47.566
She has nothing
to do with this.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.536
Not from where I'm standing.

01:06:49.569 --> 01:06:51.270
<i>You're a tough mick, Frank.</i>

01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:53.372
<i>Squeezing you
might be a waste of time.</i>

01:06:54.674 --> 01:06:56.642
It doesn't mean
that I'm not gonna give it

01:06:56.676 --> 01:06:58.244
the old college try.

01:06:58.277 --> 01:07:00.346
Griff was making his way
down onto the platform.

01:07:00.379 --> 01:07:02.415
If he sees Ivory,
he's gonna bolt.

01:07:02.448 --> 01:07:04.282
<i>Send me in there.
I can flush him out.</i>

01:07:04.315 --> 01:07:06.217
You good with that, Ive?

IVORY: <i>I've got it covered.</i>

01:07:07.786 --> 01:07:09.422
REX: <i>On my way.</i>

01:07:32.811 --> 01:07:35.679
Let's load 'em up.
We're rolling out of this place.

01:07:36.947 --> 01:07:38.750
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:07:38.783 --> 01:07:41.019
Careful, Richard.

01:07:41.052 --> 01:07:44.521
Be very careful.
[chuckling]

01:07:44.555 --> 01:07:47.323
You just couldn't get past
that blind spot, huh?

01:07:47.356 --> 01:07:49.593
For fuckin' Frank Sullivan.

01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:52.896
You've already paid me
$500,000 for the crew.

01:07:54.664 --> 01:07:58.635
If those jewels are worth
$30 million on the black market,

01:07:58.669 --> 01:08:01.537
then I am the best fence
in town.

01:08:09.046 --> 01:08:12.314
Hey, what do I need you for?

01:08:17.786 --> 01:08:20.723
Smile, boys,
we cut out the middleman!

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.661
Let's go.

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:33.300
MAN ON P.A.:
<i>Your Cincinnati Union Terminal</i>

<i>Regional line with outbound

01:09:06.733 --> 01:09:09.602
Keep this floor traffic moving.

CLAIRE: No, I know.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:25.818
Frank, get over here.

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:27.519
Griffin is right behind you.

01:09:27.553 --> 01:09:29.587
Griffin is the least
of our troubles.

01:09:29.621 --> 01:09:31.857
Ivory's got a gun
pointed at my head right now.

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:34.792
When I go after Griffin,
you get through that door,

01:09:34.827 --> 01:09:37.962
and you get as far away from
here as possible, understand?

01:09:37.996 --> 01:09:39.098
Go.

01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:42.568

Are we talking
or fighting, Frank?

01:10:56.204 --> 01:10:59.641
You want the whole score
to yourself, that's one thing.

01:10:59.674 --> 01:11:03.711
But after what you did to Joe,
fuck you, we're fighting!

01:11:07.181 --> 01:11:09.817
I'd never do that to you, Frank!
What are you talking about?

01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:11.653
You brought me into this gig!

01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:27.767
Heat's coming down,
crew's gone,

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.836
and here you are
making a run for it.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:32.571
What do you expect, Frank?
You lost your goddamned mind?

01:11:44.116 --> 01:11:46.786
Why, Griff?
Why'd you do it?

01:11:46.819 --> 01:11:48.654
I didn't do anything, Frank!

01:11:48.688 --> 01:11:50.223
Yeah?

01:11:50.257 --> 01:11:52.558
What's in that bag?

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.593
You tell me, asshole.

01:11:55.627 --> 01:11:57.128
As far as I'm concerned,
it was a bust.

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:07.638
You were in control
of the alarm system.

01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:09.674
I didn't trigger
the fucking thing.

01:12:11.676 --> 01:12:13.778
Soon as I came out
of the security room,

01:12:13.812 --> 01:12:14.879
the cops were already there.

01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:16.847
We were fucking set up, Frank!

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.717
I went out the back garage.

01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:03.226
[gun cocks]

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:04.960
Drop the gun, Frank.

01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:14.169
Drop it.

01:13:16.204 --> 01:13:17.905
[thud]

01:13:21.043 --> 01:13:23.178
We were a crew, man.

01:13:24.212 --> 01:13:26.348
Oh, we were family, man.

01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:29.151
Marshall? Baxter?

01:13:29.184 --> 01:13:31.852
Both of those motherfuckers
tried to kill me.

01:13:31.886 --> 01:13:33.621
They kept pointing
the finger at you.

01:13:33.654 --> 01:13:34.955
How the fuck was it
supposed to be me

01:13:34.989 --> 01:13:36.791
if I was still in
the fucking security room

01:13:36.824 --> 01:13:38.192
when you came out of the vault?

01:13:38.225 --> 01:13:39.794
I got cracked
in the back of the head,

01:13:39.827 --> 01:13:41.262
I woke up,
and Joe's dead next to me.

01:13:41.295 --> 01:13:43.798
Who else is it gonna be?
You're the last man!

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.170
Joey's dead?

01:13:51.205 --> 01:13:53.006
You didn't know.

01:13:55.175 --> 01:13:56.309
You didn't know.

01:13:58.078 --> 01:13:59.846
Shit, I'm sorry, Frank.

01:13:59.879 --> 01:14:02.082
I'll be a son of a bitch.

01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:08.621
If it's not you, then who?

01:14:10.023 --> 01:14:12.258
What the fuck happened, man?

01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:14.394
[gunshots]

01:14:14.427 --> 01:14:17.963
Jesus Christ! Griffin!
Griffie!

01:14:19.798 --> 01:14:21.867
Frank.

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.169
Don't even think about it.

01:14:26.038 --> 01:14:27.705
Now move.

01:14:32.311 --> 01:14:33.345
Over there.

01:14:34.946 --> 01:14:36.013
Easy.

01:14:38.817 --> 01:14:40.818
You got what you want.

01:15:08.044 --> 01:15:10.147
I don't even know what it is.

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.382
This isn't gonna go down
the way you want it to, Frank.

01:15:12.415 --> 01:15:13.849
Where is it?

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.017
Fuck.

01:15:18.955 --> 01:15:21.957
You'll never know
if you shoot me.

01:15:25.361 --> 01:15:26.694
[gunshots]

01:15:32.768 --> 01:15:34.069
[chuckles]

01:15:36.338 --> 01:15:38.373
For once, I'm glad
you didn't listen.

01:15:38.406 --> 01:15:40.476
Try to stay focused, Frank.

01:15:40.509 --> 01:15:42.944
You Sullivan boys are saps.

01:15:45.213 --> 01:15:47.748
Must run in the family.

01:15:48.917 --> 01:15:50.486
You gotta be shittin' me.

01:15:50.519 --> 01:15:54.355
All wrapped up,
neat with a bow.

01:15:54.389 --> 01:15:57.791
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone.

01:15:57.824 --> 01:16:00.128
Gotta give it to you though.

01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:05.132
All I had to do was point you
in the right direction

01:16:05.165 --> 01:16:07.234
and squeeze.

01:16:09.404 --> 01:16:12.005
[glass shatters]

01:16:12.039 --> 01:16:14.775
[ticking]

01:16:17.043 --> 01:16:18.946
Why?

01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:20.814
You'd have plenty
with Joe's share.

01:16:20.847 --> 01:16:22.516
His share?

01:16:22.549 --> 01:16:25.818
500 grand doesn't begin
to cover the markers he owed.

01:16:26.919 --> 01:16:29.990
You've been playing me
this whole time.

01:16:30.023 --> 01:16:33.893
I did save your ass
from Ivory, didn't I?

01:16:33.926 --> 01:16:36.295
I just didn't expect you
to come calling earlier today.

01:16:36.329 --> 01:16:38.464
But I rode along,

01:16:38.497 --> 01:16:41.434
watched you hunt down
the rest of the guys.

01:16:42.401 --> 01:16:44.036
Let's settle up, okay?

01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:45.770
Your money's no good here.

01:16:45.804 --> 01:16:46.972
Thanks.

01:16:49.108 --> 01:16:50.842
It was ours.

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:53.945
He was giving it all away
with his stupid even split.

01:16:53.979 --> 01:16:55.880
So I cut it my way.

01:16:55.914 --> 01:16:58.883
Joe told me whoever delivered
the case at the end of the day

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:01.419
gets the full 500 grand.

01:17:01.453 --> 01:17:04.189
How'd you know
which out we'd take?

01:17:04.222 --> 01:17:06.391
A girl like me,
I'd heard about Joe's reputation

01:17:06.424 --> 01:17:08.392
for always chasing
the big score.

01:17:08.425 --> 01:17:10.328
Even when he worked
all the angles,

01:17:10.362 --> 01:17:11.895
the chips never fell his way.

01:17:13.398 --> 01:17:15.099
OPERATOR:
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:17:15.132 --> 01:17:16.333
There's an armed robbery
in progress

01:17:16.367 --> 01:17:18.369
at the Mann Chandler Bank
downtown.

01:17:18.402 --> 01:17:21.038
Please hurry.
They just shot my manager.

01:17:22.373 --> 01:17:25.142

01:17:25.175 --> 01:17:28.077
[siren wailing]

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.182
Charlie 326, show me arrival
and hold the air.

01:17:33.217 --> 01:17:35.318
Hey, we got a report
of shots fired,

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:36.819
and we are not waiting.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.556
JOE: Fuck this.

01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:41.558
Let's clear the area
and go straight to Claire's.

01:17:41.592 --> 01:17:43.893
That wasn't part of the plan.

01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:45.994
I'm not trusting anything
we had set up with Rex.

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:48.464
Let's get to Claire and
get the fuck out of the city.

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:51.267
- Fuck.
- [glass shatters]

01:17:51.301 --> 01:17:54.304
- Get over there.
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:56.938
- Toss me the case.
- We don't have time for this!

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:59.075
I will not hesitate
to kill him.

01:17:59.108 --> 01:18:01.243
Now throw me the case.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:02.978
Jesus.

01:18:08.115 --> 01:18:10.552
The key. Where's the key?
It's no good without the key.

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:12.621
- I don't have the key.
- Bullshit!

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:15.156
You worked it all out,
every detail.

01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:17.058
I don't have it.
It wasn't part of the plan.

01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:18.125
Can he open this?

01:18:18.159 --> 01:18:19.528
I brought you in on this thing.

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:22.963
For pennies on the dollar, baby.
No, thanks.

01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:25.499
Now tell me, can your brother
open this or not?

01:18:31.105 --> 01:18:33.207
You greedy bitch.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.009
I wasted 10 years of my life
in that bar.

01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:37.410
And for what?

01:18:37.444 --> 01:18:39.280
A finder's fee
every time guys like you

01:18:39.313 --> 01:18:40.880
took down a big score?

01:18:46.186 --> 01:18:47.320
Everything good?

01:18:47.354 --> 01:18:49.923
Everything's perfect.

01:19:33.197 --> 01:19:36.200
I just didn't count on
you surviving.

01:19:36.234 --> 01:19:39.470
But I figured I could always
use someone to help me

01:19:39.504 --> 01:19:41.172
cover my tracks.

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.509
The big kahuna
would send out Ivory,

01:19:44.542 --> 01:19:47.110
and I don't wanna be
a part of any of that shit.

01:19:52.182 --> 01:19:55.519
It's probably Rex's boys
trying to squeeze me to come in.

01:19:57.287 --> 01:20:00.123
Sorry, baby.
It's a bitter little world.

01:20:00.157 --> 01:20:03.226
Why didn't you just shoot me
when you had the chance?

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:06.195
Never walk into a place you
don't know how to get out of.

01:20:06.228 --> 01:20:07.963
Sound familiar?

01:20:07.997 --> 01:20:09.299
I've got what
you're looking for.

01:20:09.332 --> 01:20:11.100
Case is secure.

01:20:11.133 --> 01:20:13.035
ROBOTIC VOICE:
<i>Same deal as before. $500,000.</i>

01:20:13.068 --> 01:20:15.738
<i>10 p.m. Place, TBD.</i>

01:20:15.771 --> 01:20:18.039
Get up.

01:20:20.309 --> 01:20:21.977
How long ago
did Griffin leave?

01:20:22.011 --> 01:20:23.412
What are you talking about?

01:20:23.446 --> 01:20:26.147
- Frank!
- Hold on!

01:20:26.181 --> 01:20:27.716
I'm not going
to ask you again.

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:30.252
- Jesus, like 30 minutes ago.
- Where?

01:20:30.286 --> 01:20:32.521
I don't know. All I heard was
something about Union Station,

01:20:32.555 --> 01:20:33.689
and that's all I know.

01:20:38.326 --> 01:20:40.462
- Jesus.
- What did you do?

01:20:40.495 --> 01:20:42.397
He went for a gun.
I'm sorry.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:44.132
[scoffs]

01:20:44.165 --> 01:20:46.634
I just didn't count on
you lasting this long.

01:20:48.602 --> 01:20:50.171
Fuck it.

01:21:02.784 --> 01:21:05.017
We're in the construction zone.

01:21:14.795 --> 01:21:16.162
You're wearing Kevlar?

01:22:11.749 --> 01:22:13.684
Diamonds.

01:22:15.553 --> 01:22:17.821
So much for
honor among thieves.

01:22:35.137 --> 01:22:37.439
We'll call this a down payment
on the next one.

01:22:38.574 --> 01:22:40.543
Sorry about your brother.

01:22:45.147 --> 01:22:47.182
It's time to get back
on the clock.
