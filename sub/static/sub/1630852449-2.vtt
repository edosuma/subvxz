00:06.916 --> 00:10.083
Do you know how many people
apply to Saint Martins College?

00:10.166 --> 00:12.416
Why should they give me a scholarship?

00:13.083 --> 00:14.250
Because you're the best.

00:18.208 --> 00:19.583
Westwood made it too.

00:22.125 --> 00:25.041
-What if I'm not Westwood?
-You are better.

00:25.666 --> 00:28.208
-Right.
-You just have to try.

00:28.833 --> 00:31.958
-You'll see.
-Sometimes I wish I was like you.

00:33.708 --> 00:36.583
-Nonsense.
-You're not scared of anything.

00:39.125 --> 00:41.208
If I shit my pants at the starting line,

00:42.291 --> 00:44.333
I can ride the gondola right back down.

00:51.416 --> 00:52.250
What?

00:57.791 --> 00:59.250
We're not done yet.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.541
It's checkmate.

01:02.416 --> 01:04.250
Nonsense, I'll get out of this.

01:04.875 --> 01:07.083
Bambi, it's checkmate.

01:11.041 --> 01:12.375
You know what scares me?

01:14.041 --> 01:15.083
You.

01:19.125 --> 01:23.375
<i>If you want to win at chess,</i>
<i>you have to know your opponent.</i>

01:24.750 --> 01:25.708
<i>Every strength,</i>

01:27.625 --> 01:28.708
<i>every weakness.</i>

01:28.791 --> 01:30.791
VANESSA'S WILD DRUG EVENING IN KITZBÜHEL

01:31.500 --> 01:34.458
DEAR BIRGER RITZENHOF,
I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR WORK.

01:34.541 --> 01:37.125
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMT OF ACTING.
ATTACHED PLEASE FIND A CASTING PHOTO.

01:37.916 --> 01:40.166
<i>You have to think several moves ahead</i>…

01:43.583 --> 01:44.666
<i>and know exactly</i>

01:44.750 --> 01:45.625
ORDER NOW

01:46.291 --> 01:48.375
<i>where you want them to be in the end.</i>

01:52.041 --> 01:54.541
Ms. von Höhenfeldt, a delivery for you.

01:54.625 --> 01:56.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:59.125 --> 02:02.458
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE VIDEO!

02:02.541 --> 02:04.041
YOURS, BIRGER RITZENHOFF

02:14.875 --> 02:16.000
Good morning, baby.

02:26.416 --> 02:27.291
Don't move.

02:28.583 --> 02:31.000
-Why not?
-So cute. Stay like that.

02:34.333 --> 02:35.916
Are you done yet?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.458
POST MADE - DONE

02:47.416 --> 02:49.250
Sorry, no time for that, baby.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.166
#morningwood.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.250
Pre-brunch with Pippa.

02:56.333 --> 02:59.250
Who's the asshole
who invented brunch anyway?

02:59.333 --> 03:03.333
No one's stopping you from working
on your next Pasadena application.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.208
Isn't it due in February?

03:07.291 --> 03:09.333
Exactly. Today's January 1st.

03:10.375 --> 03:12.500
You'll make it this time. I know it.

03:13.375 --> 03:16.416
Thanks, but I have to chill today.

03:17.083 --> 03:19.291
You've been doing that for eight months.

03:20.625 --> 03:21.458
I haven't.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.916
In the last eight months,
I've schlepped your purse around

03:25.000 --> 03:26.041
and taken your selfies.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.958
Let's not fight, okay?

03:43.583 --> 03:45.500
Dom, are you awake yet?

03:48.583 --> 03:49.583
Morning, sweetie.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.500
By the way,
Conny Breidenbacher's coming today.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.583
-You're starting with that too.
-With what?

03:54.666 --> 03:57.000
Trying to get me
into Conny's private university

03:57.083 --> 03:58.416
if I don't get into Pasadena.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.958
No at all. I'm sure you'll get in.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.583
Even if you don't,
you have so much potential.

04:03.666 --> 04:05.875
But a few good contacts can't hurt.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.541
Mom! I think that's enough.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.958
<i>The pawn is the weakest piece in chess.</i>

04:19.958 --> 04:21.500
<i>Easy to underestimate.</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:30.166
<i>But it has one advantage</i>
<i>over all the other pieces.</i>

04:32.375 --> 04:34.041
<i>Should it make it undetected</i>

04:34.541 --> 04:36.416
<i>to the other side of the board,</i>

04:39.916 --> 04:41.708
<i>it becomes a queen.</i>

04:43.291 --> 04:45.083
<i>The best piece in the game.</i>

04:47.541 --> 04:49.916
<i>But only one wrong move,</i>

04:50.583 --> 04:52.208
<i>and the plan falls apart.</i>

04:56.250 --> 04:57.166
Happy New Year.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.791
-Hey.
-Hi, Regine.

04:59.875 --> 05:00.916
Happy New Year!

05:03.041 --> 05:06.250
You're so pale.
You must still be completely traumatized.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.375
It was crazy. My whole body was shaking.

05:08.458 --> 05:11.833
We'll get you back to normal.
You still look ravishing.

05:12.541 --> 05:14.291
Honestly? Trauma looks good on you.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.041
We'll get rid of those
last few grams as well, right?

05:18.125 --> 05:18.958
Right.

05:19.041 --> 05:19.958
Hey.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.833
Hey, you.

05:21.916 --> 05:24.208
-Good morning, Ms. Forsell. I'm--
-Lisi.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.375
Vanessa's guardian angel.
Nice to see you here.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.500
-Thank you.
<i>-Buongiorno.</i>

05:29.583 --> 05:31.041
<i>-Buongiorno.</i>
-Hi.

05:31.708 --> 05:34.500
What can I get you?
Coffee? Champagne? Bloody Mary?

05:34.583 --> 05:37.958
-Champagne. Good for your circulation.
-Water for Vanessa, please.

05:38.833 --> 05:39.750
And you?

05:39.833 --> 05:42.125
Coffee would be great. Thank you.

05:42.666 --> 05:43.708
My darlings!

05:44.958 --> 05:48.500
I'm so happy so many of you
accepted my New Year's invitation.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.958
I'm especially happy
about one very special guest.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.583
Lisi Madlmeyer.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.458
Our hero from Kitzbühel,

05:56.541 --> 06:00.041
who saved the life
of our beloved Vanessa last night.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.041
-Mr. Ziervogel?
-Roger?

06:18.833 --> 06:19.958
You can come in.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.041
Happy New Year, Roger.

06:25.125 --> 06:28.166
-Did you party hard last night?
-I was on duty.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.500
Did someone call? Like my mother?

06:31.583 --> 06:32.541
No, I'm sorry.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.708
But a Dr. Albrecht
is urgently asking you to return his call.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.625
He sent you this envelope.

06:40.916 --> 06:42.750
He requests your signature.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.166
Estate management.

06:48.583 --> 06:49.958
You better keep it.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.875
It's not my business, but it seems urgent.

06:53.958 --> 06:55.583
Send it to my mother.

06:58.791 --> 07:00.791
You know how I got home?

07:00.875 --> 07:04.750
I wanted to speak to you about that.
There were a few complaints.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.416
Why? What did I do?

07:06.500 --> 07:10.333
It appears you knocked on a few doors
and startled some of the guests.

07:11.041 --> 07:11.958
I'm sorry.

07:12.666 --> 07:16.958
Among other things,
you woke up a family from Beijing and…

07:21.041 --> 07:21.916
And?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.208
Joined them.

07:24.791 --> 07:25.666
In bed.

07:27.916 --> 07:30.833
-And then you…
-I don't want to know.

07:32.250 --> 07:36.333
Listen up,
send them all a bouquet of flowers,

07:36.416 --> 07:39.708
champagne, and a card that says,

07:43.666 --> 07:44.708
"Happy New Year."

07:45.958 --> 07:47.083
"Sorry. Kosh."

07:49.833 --> 07:52.333
And tell the driver I want to leave later.

08:01.333 --> 08:02.416
Vanessa?

08:03.875 --> 08:05.250
How are you doing today?

08:05.333 --> 08:09.000
-Did you get over the shock a little?
-I'm doing better. Thanks, Lisi.

08:15.625 --> 08:19.333
If you ever want to talk about it…
I mean, I was there too.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.083
That's really nice of you.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.083
But that's what therapists are for.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.291
-Nessa.
-Yeah, that's what…

08:25.791 --> 08:26.875
Leonce is here.

08:26.958 --> 08:28.291
-Leonce is here?
-Yeah.

08:30.708 --> 08:31.541
Leonce!

08:36.000 --> 08:38.333
Give me a hug. I heard about yesterday.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.708
Yeah? Word gets around quickly.

08:40.791 --> 08:42.416
And you saved her?

08:42.500 --> 08:45.583
Sorry, Leonce. What was your name again?

08:45.666 --> 08:47.666
-Lisi Madlmeyer.
-Madlmeyer.

08:48.291 --> 08:49.458
I like that.

08:50.041 --> 08:53.958
-My parents have a ski school--
-I <i>have</i> to take a picture of you two.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.708
-Sorry…
-Yeah, just a second.

08:55.791 --> 08:59.500
You two would look amazing
on the big screen.

08:59.583 --> 09:00.916
Pipps, please!

09:01.541 --> 09:03.375
You really have an amazing presence.

09:03.458 --> 09:06.750
Watch what you say,
or I'll have to be in your next film.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.166
I'd like that.
I can put a word in for you.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.291
Tell me how you are doing.
It must've been pure terror.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.125
To be honest, I really liked it.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.500
Really? You liked it?

09:17.583 --> 09:22.250
The experience was so raw and animalistic.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.416
You're reduced to pure survival.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.291
I know the feeling.
When your primal instincts kick in.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.250
Totally.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.916
I realized that all of this

09:31.875 --> 09:32.833
doesn't mean shit.

09:33.750 --> 09:37.000
Wow. It's amazing how you're handling it.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.791
It shows real strength. Truly.
I have to move on.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.083
-Nice seeing you.
-Ciao.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.000
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.375
Oh my God.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.375
Imagine he gets you a part.

09:51.541 --> 09:52.708
What's wrong?

09:53.208 --> 09:54.791
Just a bit tired.

09:56.541 --> 10:00.125
Just us two
sweating out all the bad vibes.

10:01.041 --> 10:02.875
You are awesome.

10:02.958 --> 10:04.625
I need another drink.

10:09.833 --> 10:12.125
-I'll take those.
-Thank you.

10:12.208 --> 10:16.083
The most important thing
for a brand is to trigger emotions.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.791
So I think
the first impression is decisive.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.583
What determines the first impression?

10:21.666 --> 10:23.583
Yeah, the design.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.375
I agree.

10:26.708 --> 10:29.916
You know what?
I have a reservation at Tennerhof tonight.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.500
We could have a chat, man to man.
Pasadena isn't the only school out there.

10:38.166 --> 10:39.916
Yeah, of course.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.833
-Yeah?
-Love to.

10:40.916 --> 10:43.041
-Eight o'clock.
-That works.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.666
-Nessa.
-What are you doing here?

10:47.750 --> 10:50.166
Are you okay? We were so worried.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.000
-I'm fine. Thanks.
-Come here.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.333
Where can you go

10:54.416 --> 10:57.083
if you're not even safe
in your own chalet?

10:57.166 --> 10:58.875
The world's going to the dogs.

10:58.958 --> 11:03.750
-Happy New Year, Pippa!
-Happy New Year, Claire and Ferdinand.

11:03.833 --> 11:06.041
Are you staying for the fashion show?

11:06.541 --> 11:07.958
What fashion show?

11:08.041 --> 11:10.208
Regine's charity show. Like every year.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.333
I'm modeling
for three different designers.

11:12.416 --> 11:14.625
The flight to Miami is tonight.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.541
Regine!

11:17.083 --> 11:19.458
It's so nice to see you.

11:19.541 --> 11:21.333
-Excuse me for a moment.
-Yeah.

11:21.833 --> 11:23.250
Conny Breidenbacher.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.625
-I'll get us something to drink.
-Of course.

11:34.416 --> 11:35.250
Hey.

11:35.958 --> 11:37.666
-Hey.
-Enjoying your fame?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.166
Events like this
are only bearable when drunk.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.291
Sure you don't want a Bloody Mary?

11:44.208 --> 11:45.333
I'll be right back.

12:16.583 --> 12:19.416
Now I'm ready for a Bloody Mary.

12:20.541 --> 12:22.041
A wise decision.

12:23.541 --> 12:24.375
Thanks.

12:27.541 --> 12:30.416
Doesn't it get a bit dull after a while?

12:31.416 --> 12:34.375
Lobster, champagne,
and caviar all the time?

12:34.458 --> 12:36.791
What do you do
when you want some real fun?

12:36.875 --> 12:37.958
You're bored?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.166
I'm bored out of my mind.

12:43.041 --> 12:44.125
All right, then.

12:44.708 --> 12:47.250
We can't have that! Follow me.

12:48.875 --> 12:49.750
Thank you.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.875
-Milady.
-Thank you.

12:55.958 --> 12:57.083
Step one.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.291
-You take a bottle of champagne.
-How exquisite.

13:01.375 --> 13:02.666
Step two.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.833
Take a 19th-century saber.

13:05.916 --> 13:07.208
Groovy.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.541
Step three. Unwrap the bottle.

13:10.791 --> 13:15.666
Step four. Take the saber
and place it at the top of the bottle.

13:33.708 --> 13:37.583
-Was that too much with Leonce?
-Not at all. You two have great chemistry.

13:37.666 --> 13:42.250
-He just wants to get me in bed.
-So? He's hot. What's the problem?

13:42.333 --> 13:43.666
Dominik.

13:49.458 --> 13:50.291
Dominik!

13:52.708 --> 13:54.000
Are you crazy?

14:01.833 --> 14:04.250
Come on, Dominik. What the hell?

14:04.333 --> 14:08.083
-We were just playing around. Relax.
-She's going to sue you.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.083
For what? Champagne trauma?

14:10.166 --> 14:11.375
Harassment, Dominik.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.791
Harassment? Come on! You're paranoid.

14:13.875 --> 14:16.041
I really can't have this right now.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.250
-Don't underestimate her.
-Underestimate her?

14:21.833 --> 14:23.791
Hi, Lisi. Feeling better?

14:23.875 --> 14:25.833
Dominik can take it a bit too far.

14:25.916 --> 14:28.750
Really, it's no big deal.
I'm just a bit tired.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.541
What happened yesterday was a big deal.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.750
I think I just need to truly relax.

14:36.375 --> 14:40.125
-Maybe go to the sauna or…
-We're having a spa day today.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.208
-Come with us!
-It's members only.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.833
-I don't want to intrude.
-Don't be silly.

14:45.916 --> 14:47.583
You can be my plus one.

14:48.291 --> 14:49.291
Really?

14:50.416 --> 14:51.250
Cool.

15:39.208 --> 15:40.833
I'm her oldest, best friend.

15:40.916 --> 15:44.000
Instead, she takes this Pippa to brunch.

15:44.083 --> 15:47.083
The same Pippa
who bullied Franzi Lange into anorexia

15:47.166 --> 15:49.333
for having a skid mark in her pants.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.250
Are we going anywhere in particular?

15:51.333 --> 15:53.666
I don't get
why she'd just drop me like that?

15:54.166 --> 15:57.333
Okay, maybe I was
a bit out of line yesterday,

15:57.416 --> 15:59.291
but it wasn't that bad.

16:01.166 --> 16:02.000
I think.

16:04.541 --> 16:05.583
Or was it bad?

16:09.041 --> 16:10.125
It was bad, right?

16:12.250 --> 16:14.458
Was your trip nice, otherwise?

16:15.666 --> 16:17.000
So-so. My father's dead,

16:17.083 --> 16:20.291
and my mother's in Greenland
taking pictures of melting glaciers.

16:22.041 --> 16:25.416
Or is she putting out fires in the Amazon?
I'm not really sure.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.958
In any case,
she cares deeply about the planet.

16:28.500 --> 16:34.375
SPA DAY
117 LIKES

16:37.791 --> 16:38.750
Change of plans!

16:41.916 --> 16:43.166
To the country club!

16:51.958 --> 16:54.083
Leonce invited us to go on his boat.

16:54.666 --> 16:57.166
-Isn't that cool?
-Us or you?

16:57.916 --> 17:00.666
-I know you don't like him.
-He wants to screw you.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.666
Could it not be that he's just nice?

17:03.750 --> 17:05.000
Anything's possible.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.458
But he does want to screw you.

17:08.125 --> 17:11.458
So what if he does?
It doesn't mean that I want to.

17:11.541 --> 17:12.791
Smoothie service is here!

17:12.875 --> 17:15.916
-Kosh, what are you doing here?
-I spotted you on Insta.

17:17.041 --> 17:17.875
Nice!

17:18.750 --> 17:20.916
A little apology
for my meltdown yesterday.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.166
Come on, man.
We all had a bit too much yesterday.

17:24.750 --> 17:25.625
No, thanks.

17:27.708 --> 17:28.541
Hold on!

17:28.625 --> 17:31.833
Weren't you the waitress last night?
You were!

17:31.916 --> 17:34.125
Then you spilled that drink all over her.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.875
Bullseye.

17:35.958 --> 17:38.291
-Then she chased away a burglar.
-Really?

17:39.166 --> 17:41.500
That's all I remember about last night.

17:42.416 --> 17:43.750
No, not now.

17:45.291 --> 17:47.958
Did I tell you about my little farmer boy?

17:48.041 --> 17:50.125
I swear, country boys are the best.

17:50.750 --> 17:51.791
It's too hot here.

17:56.666 --> 17:57.916
What's up with her?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.875
No idea. I don't want to get involved.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.916
Get involved in what? What does that mean?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.708
Come on, let's drink.

18:05.791 --> 18:06.791
Lisi?

18:06.875 --> 18:08.625
-I'm gonna check on Vanessa.
-Okay.

18:13.791 --> 18:16.333
Go on, tell me. What did he look like?

18:17.250 --> 18:18.083
All right.

18:18.708 --> 18:21.125
Big, calves like this.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.875
-Not like yours.
-Hey!

18:46.875 --> 18:47.958
How's it going?

18:48.666 --> 18:49.500
Not good.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.375
<i>I'm still not getting close enough.</i>

18:53.000 --> 18:54.083
Where are you now?

18:54.583 --> 18:55.416
<i>Don't ask.</i>

18:56.083 --> 18:58.625
<i>-Hey, Heidi.</i>
<i>-Damn, I'll call you back.</i>

19:01.625 --> 19:02.541
My name's Lisi.

19:02.625 --> 19:03.500
Whatever.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.375
What do you want from me?

19:05.458 --> 19:07.458
The best friend job is taken.

19:07.541 --> 19:09.541
By me. So save yourself the effort.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.291
You might lose that job
quicker than you think.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.166
I don't think so.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.541
I might know something
about you that Vanessa doesn't.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.833
You mean me and Ferdinand?

19:25.583 --> 19:28.250
Go ahead and tell Vanessa about it.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.416
Who do you think she'll believe?

19:30.500 --> 19:33.708
Some bitch from a random village
or her best friend?

19:35.750 --> 19:38.750
Just face it, Heidi.
I'm already ten steps ahead of you.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.583
Vanessa is mine, and so is daddy dearest.

19:41.666 --> 19:47.041
So enjoy your big day at the country club,
then it's back to the cowshed for you.

19:56.375 --> 19:57.375
No!

20:17.916 --> 20:19.041
What's going on?

20:19.125 --> 20:20.208
<i>Pippa is going on.</i>

20:21.666 --> 20:23.166
The guard dog has to go,

20:23.250 --> 20:25.041
or I can't get to Vanessa.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.208
<i>Wait, hang on.</i>

20:28.916 --> 20:30.791
<i>We need the PIN to her phone.</i>

20:31.625 --> 20:33.500
<i>You're good with technology.</i>

20:34.875 --> 20:37.666
Can you describe what's inside?

20:39.125 --> 20:42.333
A black jacket with purple fur collars,

20:42.416 --> 20:43.666
fur sleeves,

20:44.583 --> 20:48.000
leather leggings
and black boots with rhinestones.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.833
That seems right. Thank you.

21:00.916 --> 21:01.750
Thank you.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.375
Okay.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.291
Left button, right button.

21:12.375 --> 21:13.583
SWIPE UP TO UNLOCK

21:13.666 --> 21:15.583
Then cancel.

21:45.416 --> 21:47.750
-Pipps, I'm cold. Are you coming?
-Yeah.

21:49.958 --> 21:52.500
My mom always says
I have so much potential.

21:52.583 --> 21:55.833
If you ask me,
just let the potential be potential.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.458
Don't even touch it.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.958
What if there is no potential?

22:00.625 --> 22:02.125
Just a fucking desert.

22:03.291 --> 22:04.166
Just tunda.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.208
-You mean tundra with an "r".
-No, tunda.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.958
-Tundra. Like taiga and tundra.
-Taigra and tunda.

22:09.041 --> 22:11.541
-Taiga and tundra, you dyslexic tool.
-That's what I said.

22:11.625 --> 22:12.625
Be quiet!

22:12.708 --> 22:16.166
-What's your problem?
-This is the rest area, not après ski.

22:16.250 --> 22:17.708
Sorry.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.666
Are you out of your mind?

22:24.583 --> 22:26.666
Cheers. Right out of a paper cup.

22:27.625 --> 22:31.291
-People like you used to be--
-People like us? What do you mean?

22:31.375 --> 22:33.416
-Domi…
-No, I don't understand.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.541
What do you mean? Tell me.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.000
I'm reporting this.

22:45.041 --> 22:47.708
I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.

22:49.625 --> 22:52.083
-What happened this time?
-That guy was racist.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.208
-What guy?
-Forget it.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.583
Not worth mentioning.

22:55.666 --> 22:56.958
Why were you thrown out?

22:57.041 --> 23:00.250
We were just
drinking a little and chatting.

23:00.333 --> 23:01.750
How old are you two? 12?

23:04.625 --> 23:07.333
-Okay, then we'll get changed.
-Thanks a lot.

23:17.041 --> 23:18.250
Is everything okay?

23:20.875 --> 23:22.041
It was harmless.

23:23.041 --> 23:23.958
I'm good.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.333
But?

23:27.125 --> 23:29.458
She just doesn't get it.

23:41.875 --> 23:43.541
What should we do now?

23:43.625 --> 23:46.083
Pippa and I are going to an art preview.

23:46.166 --> 23:47.000
Alone.

23:47.625 --> 23:48.666
Wait!

23:48.750 --> 23:49.583
Nessa!

23:51.416 --> 23:53.500
Just tell me what's going on.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.416
Whatever I did yesterday, I'm sorry.

23:57.333 --> 24:00.250
-It's not just about yesterday, Kosh.
-Then what?

24:01.833 --> 24:02.708
Tell me!

24:04.916 --> 24:06.541
The photo you posted.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.083
What photo?

24:10.166 --> 24:11.166
Forget it, Kosh.

24:12.916 --> 24:16.041
Wait. That photo of you and Wirsing?
It was over a year ago.

24:16.125 --> 24:17.916
It'll float around online forever.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.458
My parents, maybe?
The press? The whole fucking internet?

24:23.541 --> 24:25.666
Guys, could you please stop fighting?

24:25.750 --> 24:27.208
Okay? Please.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.375
You only care about what people think.

24:30.333 --> 24:33.000
You have no idea
how much shit my dad gave me

24:33.083 --> 24:35.291
because of one drug photo
with a petty criminal.

24:35.375 --> 24:36.208
Guys.

24:36.291 --> 24:38.541
Who you then invited to my party!

24:39.541 --> 24:43.000
Let me get this straight,
you've been mad at me for a year?

24:43.083 --> 24:44.791
I'm not mad at you.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.833
I just can't trust you anymore.

24:47.916 --> 24:51.000
Because of a photo I posted a year ago?

24:51.541 --> 24:52.708
Apparently. I…

24:53.583 --> 24:55.291
I can't even remember it.

24:57.333 --> 24:59.291
And that's precisely the problem.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.833
But that not an excuse anymore.

25:01.916 --> 25:04.083
You never think
about how it makes me look.

25:06.583 --> 25:08.166
You bastard!

26:07.916 --> 26:11.666
We look like Trump's illegitimate children
on their way to golf camp.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.041
Koshi, baby, you look amazing.

26:18.166 --> 26:19.583
I got it. No worries.

26:20.083 --> 26:24.000
-Let's say 3,000. For the inconvenience.
-Thank you.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.958
You guys don't care about anything,
do you?

26:29.541 --> 26:32.458
Have a nice day, Mr. Reed.
Say hi to your mother.

26:33.958 --> 26:35.750
Something terrible happened.

26:36.833 --> 26:38.041
I'm sober again.

26:39.916 --> 26:44.166
-What should we do about that?
-It's obvious. Swarovski party!

26:44.250 --> 26:46.166
-Boring!
-Okay.

26:47.625 --> 26:48.958
I know a place.

26:50.458 --> 26:52.750
But it's really exotic.

27:12.458 --> 27:14.291
This place is so local.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.083
-Yeah, how about we leave?
-I love it!

27:23.958 --> 27:25.291
Who'd she bring with her?

27:25.375 --> 27:26.958
Wow, what do we have here?

27:28.041 --> 27:30.125
The Kitzbühel fire department.

27:31.166 --> 27:34.333
I've died and been reborn
in a Tom of Finland comic.

27:34.416 --> 27:36.416
-I got you!
-Thank you, God!

27:37.916 --> 27:38.750
Yes.

27:39.666 --> 27:41.375
Let's go to the fire, girls.

27:43.708 --> 27:45.791
Hey, are you drunk?

27:45.875 --> 27:47.666
No.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.916
-I'm sorry.
-No. Don't touch it.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.583
-Wait, it's almost gone.
-Don't touch it.

27:53.666 --> 27:54.625
We're good.

27:55.458 --> 27:57.875
-Move on now.
-I said I was sorry.

27:59.791 --> 28:02.750
What a klutz.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.041
Hey, man!

28:07.625 --> 28:09.750
-We want some of your magic potion.
-Two?

28:12.208 --> 28:15.500
All of it.
And something extra for table service.

28:27.458 --> 28:30.000
SWEETIE,
HOW WAS YOUR MEETING WITH CONNY?

28:30.083 --> 28:32.083
HOPE IT ALL WENT WELL! KISSES, MOM

28:32.166 --> 28:33.333
Everything all right?

28:47.916 --> 28:50.875
SWIPE UP FOR FACE ID OR ENTER PASSCODE

29:09.166 --> 29:12.041
Okay, sweethearts. Cheers!

29:12.125 --> 29:13.666
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

29:13.750 --> 29:14.625
Cheers.

29:16.750 --> 29:20.625
Okay, are you ready
for an old Kitzbühel New Year's tradition?

29:20.708 --> 29:22.000
Yes.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.583
Truth or Dare.

29:23.666 --> 29:24.875
You're joking, right?

29:24.958 --> 29:26.833
Sorry, you don't have a choice.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.166
We'll start off easy.

29:35.083 --> 29:38.125
Vanessa, truth or dare?

29:39.666 --> 29:40.583
Truth.

29:41.750 --> 29:45.625
Tell us about one of your guilty pleasures
no one knows about.

29:48.333 --> 29:51.625
This is super lame,
but I love Mozart Pillows.

29:51.708 --> 29:52.958
You mean Mozart Balls.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.916
No, it's "Pillows", the chocolate.

29:57.875 --> 29:59.958
Okay, Vanessa, you pick someone.

30:01.875 --> 30:02.958
Hey.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.458
I wanted to buy a mulled wine,
but they're all out.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.666
-Basto, just take some. It's no problem.
-I'm not talking to you.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.791
We won't let
you little snots mess with us.

30:15.458 --> 30:18.083
-Yeah?
-Basto, it's okay. They're with me.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.250
You think you own this town.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.833
-That's enough!
-What?

30:25.250 --> 30:27.416
-Thanks, Hans.
-Hello, Hans.

30:30.666 --> 30:31.583
You know him?

30:31.666 --> 30:32.708
No.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.666
If you say so.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.458
I wanted to apologize
for what just happened.

30:40.041 --> 30:43.166
-Some alpine absinthe.
-We were just leaving, right?

30:43.250 --> 30:44.083
Sweet.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.375
Now you have to play
Truth or Dare with us.

30:46.458 --> 30:48.208
I'd rather not.

30:49.708 --> 30:51.583
Sit down. Don't be scared.

30:51.666 --> 30:53.458
-Come on, sit down.
-Come on.

30:53.541 --> 30:54.625
You get to choose.

30:55.625 --> 30:56.916
All right.

30:59.916 --> 31:03.041
Okay, Lisi. Truth or dare?

31:04.333 --> 31:05.166
Dare.

31:05.791 --> 31:07.291
Dare…

31:10.416 --> 31:13.666
Take your phone out,
and he'll read the last ten messages.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.750
-Nice!
-I like!

31:15.833 --> 31:17.791
-I'll take truth, actually.
-Too late.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.916
Are you hiding something, Heidi?

31:33.916 --> 31:35.583
Let me do it, honey.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.500
Hey.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.041
Okay,

31:40.125 --> 31:42.208
the first message is from

31:43.833 --> 31:44.666
Pippa?

31:45.250 --> 31:46.083
What?

31:46.708 --> 31:48.583
-That's what it says.
-Read it.

31:50.125 --> 31:54.583
"If you tell Vanessa anything,
I'll destroy you. I swear."

31:56.083 --> 31:57.000
What?

32:03.250 --> 32:05.083
I didn't write this.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.708
If you tell me what, Lisi?

32:13.000 --> 32:13.833
Give it back.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.375
I can't say. I'm sorry.

32:17.875 --> 32:19.916
Okay, what's going on here?

32:20.500 --> 32:21.333
Pippa?

32:22.791 --> 32:24.250
I didn't write that…

32:24.333 --> 32:25.250
-Your phone!
-No.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.625
Give me your phone!

32:27.250 --> 32:29.208
-Nessa, it wasn't me, okay?
-Pippa!

32:34.000 --> 32:35.458
MESSAGES
FERDINAND

32:37.666 --> 32:38.750
PHOTO

32:41.875 --> 32:43.250
Show me! Shit!

32:44.708 --> 32:45.583
Fuck.

32:46.416 --> 32:48.916
You're fucking my dad? Are you serious?

32:50.208 --> 32:51.958
You're such a sick…

32:52.041 --> 32:53.125
This is disgusting!

32:54.041 --> 32:57.375
-You! You're such a little--
-Pippa.

32:59.250 --> 33:00.750
It'd be best if you left.

33:02.083 --> 33:04.750
-Nessa, let me explain--
-Don't call me Nessa.

33:05.500 --> 33:08.375
-It's not what it seems.
-You cheap little slut.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.666
It's not what it…

33:11.750 --> 33:13.125
Get lost!

33:23.333 --> 33:25.291
I'm so sorry.

33:32.166 --> 33:33.291
Where's the party?

34:01.208 --> 34:04.416
Stay there, young man!
This is the country club police.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.458
-What's the problem, officer?
-You're under arrest.

34:08.041 --> 34:11.666
-For being too sexy. Come with me.
-Where to?

34:13.041 --> 34:15.000
Make-out prison, where else?

34:16.208 --> 34:18.250
Wait, there's something in there!

34:19.208 --> 34:20.125
Too late.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.083
Hansi! You and this snob?

34:29.833 --> 34:31.875
-What are you doing with him?
-Nothing.

34:32.416 --> 34:35.416
-This is the kind of guy you're into?
-Hands off, buddy.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.500
-This is what Kitzbühel thinks of you.
-Let him go.

34:38.583 --> 34:41.083
He's ruining the whole town
and doesn't realize it.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.708
Go home and sleep it off.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.583
Fuck whoever you want.

34:55.291 --> 34:56.416
Okay.

35:11.208 --> 35:14.583
This next song is for Joseph,
who we lost a year ago.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.500
Wherever you are, this one's for you.

35:19.208 --> 35:20.041
Joseph!

35:38.541 --> 35:39.458
Are you okay?

35:44.083 --> 35:45.458
Leave me alone for a minute.

36:00.750 --> 36:01.833
Hey.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.291
Hey.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.708
Would you rather be alone?

36:10.208 --> 36:11.833
I can't listen to this song.

36:19.416 --> 36:20.291
Kosh.

36:20.875 --> 36:22.958
I don't know. I don't feel so good.

36:26.875 --> 36:28.166
Listen up,

36:28.250 --> 36:30.625
my mulled wine had
some liquid ecstasy in it.

36:31.166 --> 36:32.333
Some what?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.791
I know. Shit. I'm sorry.

36:35.333 --> 36:38.333
I'll get you home
before it really kicks in.

36:38.416 --> 36:41.375
I can't go home.
My parents can't see me like this.

36:42.000 --> 36:42.916
You sure?

36:44.083 --> 36:45.958
I don't want to go to the farm.

36:46.041 --> 36:48.958
Okay, not to the farm.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.583
Then, I'll take you to my place.
No stress.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.541
Yeah!

36:56.125 --> 36:57.791
Okay. Come on, let's go.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.125
Nice and slow.

37:00.208 --> 37:01.833
We're going home.

37:03.125 --> 37:05.375
If there anything I can do, then…

37:09.750 --> 37:10.583
He's gone.

37:13.416 --> 37:15.666
Forever. And I still don't get it.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.000
Who's gone?

37:18.166 --> 37:19.291
My brother, Joseph.

37:21.625 --> 37:22.875
He died a year ago.

37:29.958 --> 37:33.166
-I didn't want to burden you with that.
-No, it's okay.

37:35.250 --> 37:37.333
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

37:38.541 --> 37:39.875
Living with that must

37:40.583 --> 37:41.875
be unbearable.

38:00.541 --> 38:02.291
<i>You made the right moves.</i>

38:03.916 --> 38:06.416
<i>You were five steps</i>
<i>ahead of your opponent.</i>

38:11.458 --> 38:14.083
<i>The only one who can still beat you</i>…

38:16.791 --> 38:17.958
<i>is yourself.</i>

38:20.041 --> 38:23.166
I need to go back to Vanessa.

38:33.916 --> 38:37.083
<i>You were certain</i>
<i>this couldn't happen to you.</i>

38:44.000 --> 38:47.041
<i>And now, you have only one thought…</i>

38:50.166 --> 38:52.375
<i>don't make the same mistake he did.</i>

41:18.583 --> 41:21.708
