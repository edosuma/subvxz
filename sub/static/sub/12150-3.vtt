00:01.929 --> 00:02.839
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:05.660
You expecting somebody else?

00:06.129 --> 00:08.550
We're on the same side.
Why can't we fight together?

00:09.130 --> 00:10.179
I'm on my own.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.580
You won't be happy until you
get close to death.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.359
It's not gonna happen, little sister.

00:18.730 --> 00:19.920
Goodbye, Alana.

00:22.929 --> 00:25.600
I killed her.
She was the reason, man.

00:26.530 --> 00:28.000
- It's haunted.
- It's rent-controlled!

00:28.329 --> 00:30.359
I have a roommate that I never see.

00:31.329 --> 00:32.939
Hey, Dennis, put that back!

00:35.530 --> 00:38.579
We'll even the score with him.
Beginning with what's in that box.

00:39.130 --> 00:42.460
We're all very pleased
you're here, Darla.

00:43.329 --> 00:44.979
- He's here.
- Angel.

00:46.329 --> 00:48.609
I'd love to see that boy.

00:50.530 --> 00:54.390
"Send in the Clowns" and
"Tears of a Clown," both in one night!

00:55.329 --> 00:58.810
Well, I was sort of
going for a medley.

00:59.530 --> 01:04.099
- More of a due-dly really, wasn't it?
- I couldn't come up with a third.

01:04.930 --> 01:07.489
I've never seen you open up
like that before.

01:08.530 --> 01:12.430
- You've been practicing, haven't you?
- A little.

01:13.329 --> 01:14.939
- Where?
- In the shower.

01:15.129 --> 01:19.170
It so shows. You really put
your heart into it.

01:19.930 --> 01:23.790
- Question is, what happens to it now?
- It?

01:24.730 --> 01:28.209
Your heart, big softie. It may not be
beating, but it can still break.

01:28.930 --> 01:33.319
- What do you mean?
- You've come to a bend in your road.

01:34.930 --> 01:37.950
Whether that slows you down
is up to you.

01:41.530 --> 01:46.200
There are hills and mountains
Between us

01:47.530 --> 01:51.040
Always something to get over

02:10.930 --> 02:13.490
Darla. I was afraid
you weren't coming.

02:14.530 --> 02:18.949
- I've been here the whole time, silly.
- You have?

02:20.530 --> 02:22.419
Just waiting for you.

02:24.729 --> 02:27.259
Aren't you going to ask me to dance?

02:49.930 --> 02:51.610
Right here, right now

02:52.330 --> 02:56.189
Right by my side
Yeah

02:57.729 --> 02:59.939
I still can't believe you're here.

03:00.129 --> 03:03.039
I mean, I killed you.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.319
I'm over that.

03:09.129 --> 03:12.219
Have you told anyone about
these dates of ours?

03:12.729 --> 03:16.060
No. I want you all for myself.

03:18.129 --> 03:20.020
I know how you feel.

03:21.729 --> 03:23.659
It's so strange.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.050
But good.

03:29.530 --> 03:30.900
But good.

03:36.729 --> 03:39.500
Somebody get these two
love vamps a room.

04:53.329 --> 04:57.649
- This place will never get clean.
- It's just a little dust.

04:58.730 --> 05:02.279
Oh, this isn't mere dust.
This is Son of Dust.

05:02.930 --> 05:06.970
This is the kind of dust that spawns
generations of baby dust.

05:09.529 --> 05:12.550
- I give up.
- We'll just move back to your place.

05:13.129 --> 05:14.529
And I'm dusting.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.310
Where's Angel?

05:18.529 --> 05:21.829
- I believe the word is "Hello."
- "Where's Angel?" summed it up.

05:22.730 --> 05:24.310
- We got work to do.
- He's still sleeping.

05:25.129 --> 05:27.689
Sleeping? It's 3:30.
I've been up since dawn.

05:28.129 --> 05:31.540
Sort of missing the whole "Creature
of the Night" angle.

05:32.329 --> 05:34.579
- I know I said 4:00.
- You had an appointment?

05:35.329 --> 05:36.699
He didn't brief you?

05:37.730 --> 05:39.759
We're meeting a snitch downtown.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.810
- The guy has a line on Deevak.
- Deevak?

05:42.529 --> 05:45.689
Demon in my neighborhood.
He hurt two of my men.

05:46.129 --> 05:47.949
Can you go in and knock on his coffin?

05:48.529 --> 05:49.970
He doesn't use a coffin.

05:50.930 --> 05:54.930
Haven't you heard the expression
"Let sleeping vampires lie"?

05:56.930 --> 05:59.420
He'll rise on his own.
He always does.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.439
Maybe we can help.

06:05.930 --> 06:09.120
To find Deevak, I'm gonna need
more than C-3PO...

06:10.129 --> 06:12.449
...and Stick-Figure Barbie with me.
No offense.

06:12.529 --> 06:16.709
- Very little taken.
- He's a badass. I need serious muscle.

06:19.129 --> 06:23.310
Demons of the underworld, beware!
Your time on Earth is drawing nigh!

06:27.529 --> 06:30.060
- David, hi.
- I got here as quick as I could.

06:30.529 --> 06:31.649
We paged you two days ago.

06:32.329 --> 06:34.750
I was in Kuala Lumpur.
Hostile takeover.

06:35.329 --> 06:39.399
Identify yourself, traveler.
Are you also a fellow demon-killer?

06:40.129 --> 06:41.180
Who is this guy?

06:41.329 --> 06:43.470
David Nabit, meet Charles Gunn.

06:44.329 --> 06:45.379
Gunn, Nabit.

06:46.129 --> 06:47.389
Pleasure's all mine.

06:49.129 --> 06:51.300
So where's Angel?

06:52.129 --> 06:55.389
- He's still sleeping.
- At 3:30? I've been up since dawn.

06:56.930 --> 06:58.160
Sorry I'm late.

06:58.730 --> 07:02.100
I stand ready to fight the good
fight, sir. What do you need?

07:02.329 --> 07:03.029
Financial advice.

07:05.329 --> 07:06.660
Okay. Good.

07:07.730 --> 07:11.800
This is our new base of operations.
We're leasing with an option to buy.

07:12.529 --> 07:14.459
What are you willing
to put down?

07:14.930 --> 07:16.399
- "Nothing" would be good.
- Oh, easy.

07:16.730 --> 07:20.279
You could finance
and take over the owner's payments...

07:21.529 --> 07:23.350
...or get a preservation grant...

07:23.329 --> 07:27.399
...and restore the original decor
and get a tax break and a loan...

07:28.730 --> 07:31.120
...or you could try for an FHA
and get a PMI.

07:33.529 --> 07:35.420
Is anybody else getting warm?

07:37.730 --> 07:41.939
Do that "tax breaks,
FHA and PMI" part again.

07:46.730 --> 07:50.490
I'll have my money guy
run some numbers, and we'll....

07:51.529 --> 07:52.470
Thanks.

07:56.930 --> 08:00.089
Is this demon-fighting cool
or what, huh?

08:02.930 --> 08:05.629
- We need to move on this.
- Relax. We'll make it.

08:05.930 --> 08:08.100
Relax? When you need a favor,
I'm there.

08:08.930 --> 08:11.629
First time I need your help,
you sleep all day.

08:11.930 --> 08:13.930
Cordy, you're driving.

08:14.930 --> 08:17.529
Me, drive your car? So cool.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.629
- We're gonna need some bribe money.
- Wait a minute.

08:20.930 --> 08:23.490
- Thought you wanted to move on this.
- They'll slow us up.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.579
To go against Deevak,
we need help.

08:26.329 --> 08:28.189
Pick me up in the back.

08:29.930 --> 08:31.889
- Good.
- Shotgun.

09:01.970 --> 09:03.480
Too late, he split.

09:03.769 --> 09:06.440
Maybe he heard
what a pleasant person you were.

09:07.370 --> 09:08.419
There.

09:16.370 --> 09:18.580
- Who's Gunn?
- Me. You Jameel?

09:25.370 --> 09:27.159
Here's the money.

09:28.370 --> 09:29.629
Keep it.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.230
I changed my mind.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.639
Fine. You're gonna tell me
where Deevak is.

09:39.169 --> 09:43.740
I know you have a rep, and I ain't
looking to make no new enemies.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.700
I can't help you with Deevak.
He'll know it was me.

09:48.169 --> 09:50.940
Demon's got eyes, ears
and teeth all over.

09:51.769 --> 09:54.720
There's a chance he had
some vamps tail me here.

09:55.370 --> 09:56.529
I don't see nothing.

09:57.169 --> 10:01.519
Good. I'm just here to pay my respects
and get home before sundown.

10:02.570 --> 10:04.289
You better tell me what you know.

10:04.970 --> 10:08.830
I'm sorry. But Deevak scares me
a lot more than you do.

10:12.169 --> 10:13.179
Gunn!

10:13.370 --> 10:14.879
- Scared now?
- What are you doing?

10:15.769 --> 10:18.789
- I got people dying.
- I didn't do anything!

10:20.570 --> 10:24.679
Think I care? It's survival of the
fittest, and you don't look too fit.

10:28.370 --> 10:31.039
- Let go. This is my case.
- It was. Now it's mine.

10:35.570 --> 10:38.409
- Angel!
- I told you I was being watched.

11:24.169 --> 11:26.909
- I'm so sick of dust.
- I can't lift my arm.

11:27.769 --> 11:32.019
- This vamp did a number on my ribs.
- Afraid I threw my back out again.

11:34.970 --> 11:37.139
Lovely.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.799
Grease stains all over my new outfit!

11:45.769 --> 11:49.950
Maybe my pain isn't physical, but my
dry-cleaning bill will be huge.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.100
We still didn't find Deevak.

11:53.570 --> 11:56.059
- Probably for the best.
- How do you figure?

11:56.570 --> 11:59.690
We're not prepared to face Deevak
in our condition.

12:00.169 --> 12:01.330
You ready to pack it in?

12:01.970 --> 12:04.139
I thought you were
the demon experts.

12:04.370 --> 12:09.110
We should've been able to lick them
faster than that. We need to regroup.

12:10.970 --> 12:13.669
I'm gonna track down
Jameel and make him talk.

12:14.570 --> 12:17.759
When you do, you may wanna be more
Guy Pearce in L.A. Confidential...

12:18.169 --> 12:20.419
...and less Michael Madsen
in Reservoir Dogs,

12:21.169 --> 12:25.000
I haven't seen a movie since Denzel
was robbed of the Oscar for Malcolm X,

12:26.570 --> 12:27.730
Later.

12:30.169 --> 12:34.000
- That was quite a performance.
- Talk about wound up too tight.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.409
No, I mean Denzel.

12:36.769 --> 12:37.610
Oh.

12:37.970 --> 12:39.649
Well, he's always great.

12:40.370 --> 12:41.629
What about you?

12:42.169 --> 12:43.750
Who doesn't love Denzel?

12:44.570 --> 12:46.820
No, what you said before. It's true.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.529
You've never had such trouble
with a simple vampire.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.110
Off day. Let's go.

13:04.809 --> 13:08.529
- Home sweet hotel.
- Just bring the car back tomorrow.

13:10.210 --> 13:13.049
- Are you okay?
- I just need some sleep.

13:13.809 --> 13:16.230
That seems to be all
you've been doing lately.

13:16.809 --> 13:19.129
- Not that I'm judging.
- Good night.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.610
Sleep tight.

13:22.210 --> 13:23.960
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

13:31.809 --> 13:34.200
Jeez, Dennis. It's like
a meat locker in here.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.669
Did you turn down
the thermostat again?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.610
Thank you.

13:42.610 --> 13:45.379
What is it with ghosts and cold rooms?

14:23.850 --> 14:26.129
Dennis! Phone!

14:37.649 --> 14:39.230
What's that ringing?

14:39.450 --> 14:42.009
Nothing, darling. It'll stop.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.629
Where's it coming from?

14:46.649 --> 14:48.230
Ignore it.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.509
Why are you so good to me
after everything I did?

14:59.850 --> 15:01.110
Because...

15:02.250 --> 15:04.250
...you and I are one.

15:07.850 --> 15:11.149
See? I told you it would stop.

15:16.850 --> 15:20.289
Wesley, where are you? Are you there?

15:20.450 --> 15:23.539
Wesley? Where are you guys?

15:24.649 --> 15:26.610
I don't know what I should do.

15:27.049 --> 15:29.399
I had a vision. It's Gunn.

15:30.049 --> 15:32.649
He's in trouble. I think it's bad.

15:33.049 --> 15:34.519
Where are you guys?

15:35.450 --> 15:39.169
I'm going over there.
When you get this message...

15:39.649 --> 15:42.600
...get Angel and meet me
at Gunn's, okay?

15:49.250 --> 15:50.899
I need a weapon.

15:58.250 --> 16:01.730
Okay, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

16:17.649 --> 16:19.509
Gunn?

16:37.450 --> 16:39.940
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you doing?

16:40.450 --> 16:43.009
Saving you from a killer demon!

16:47.049 --> 16:48.350
Not a demon?

16:50.049 --> 16:52.149
And I didn't just save your life?

16:54.250 --> 16:55.299
Right.

17:00.850 --> 17:04.890
- What are you thinking about?
- You. Us.

17:06.848 --> 17:08.150
- You seem sad.

17:08.650 --> 17:11.700
It's just.... I have to go.

17:12.848 --> 17:15.059
- Where?
- Away.

17:16.450 --> 17:20.029
- I'll go with you.
- You can't. I'm in danger.

17:20.650 --> 17:22.089
I'll protect you.

17:26.650 --> 17:29.319
You're too busy
protecting everyone else.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.059
Wesley? Stop it!

17:46.450 --> 17:48.619
- You made her go away!
- Angel, it's me!

17:49.450 --> 17:53.029
- What are you doing here?
- Gunn's in trouble. Can't breathe.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.230
- Gunn can't breathe?
- I can't breathe!

17:56.049 --> 17:56.960
Oh, sorry.

17:59.049 --> 18:00.519
It's quite all right.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.240
Now, about the naked thing.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.839
- I'll get dressed.
- Much appreciated.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.400
No, no.

18:13.490 --> 18:17.700
- There you go. Good as new.
- I think you cracked my skull.

18:18.289 --> 18:20.250
Well, that's new, right?

18:23.089 --> 18:26.420
- Where are you going?
- Walking you out. You're going home.

18:29.089 --> 18:31.829
Don't dismiss me.
I know what I'm talking about.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.650
Like how you knew Joey was a demon?

18:35.089 --> 18:37.019
I was just trying to help you.

18:37.490 --> 18:41.000
It helps a guy's rep when a white
beauty queen comes to his rescue...

18:41.690 --> 18:45.309
- ...in front of his crew.
- You are in big-time danger.

18:45.890 --> 18:49.859
I saw you in a vision,
fighting for your life.

18:50.690 --> 18:51.920
You were so scared!

18:52.490 --> 18:54.309
I don't get scared.

18:54.890 --> 18:57.869
I do. Sometimes I get terrified.

18:58.490 --> 19:00.099
Right now, I am scared for you.

19:00.289 --> 19:02.430
Be scared for me back at your place.

19:02.690 --> 19:04.339
I won't leave until you're safe.

19:05.089 --> 19:07.299
I don't want a sidekick, so go home.

19:08.089 --> 19:10.690
- No.
- Thanks for coming. Drive safe.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.059
So where's your car?

19:16.490 --> 19:19.400
So where's your car?

19:23.089 --> 19:24.910
Angel is not gonna be happy...

19:25.490 --> 19:27.910
...when he finds out
I let his car get stolen.

19:28.490 --> 19:32.000
What are the chances that
a vampire has insurance?

19:32.690 --> 19:34.160
I'll find the car.

19:35.089 --> 19:36.319
How are you gonna do that?

19:36.890 --> 19:38.960
There's a couple of guys
that jack vintage cars.

19:39.289 --> 19:40.829
We'll look until we find it.

19:41.690 --> 19:44.880
Then what? Just ask
them to give it back?

19:45.289 --> 19:46.130
I'll say please.

19:46.490 --> 19:50.880
You'll use your charm, like you did
this afternoon with that pigeon stool.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.329
It's "stool pigeon."

19:54.289 --> 19:55.759
You have no clue about me.

19:56.089 --> 19:59.740
- Paging Mr. Rationalization.
- Ms. About-to-be-thrown-out-of-a-car!

20:00.289 --> 20:04.190
Be rude, but I'm not going anywhere
until I know you're safe.

20:05.089 --> 20:08.039
Me, rude? You showed up,
attacked my boy...

20:08.690 --> 20:10.410
...then hijacked my life.

20:11.089 --> 20:13.410
I find your car,
you give me my freedom back.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.859
That's not how it works.
You need protection.

20:17.089 --> 20:19.230
And how do you plan to protect me?

20:20.089 --> 20:21.630
With some weak ladysmith battle-ax?

20:21.890 --> 20:26.140
Ask Joey and his cracked skull
how weak it is.

20:27.289 --> 20:30.200
Besides, I've also got this.

20:33.289 --> 20:34.549
- Mace.
- Mace?

20:34.490 --> 20:35.650
Squirt in the eyes.

20:36.289 --> 20:38.539
Think I'll be jumped by
a purse-snatching demon?

20:39.289 --> 20:43.710
It'll have to do, because I'm your
protector, whether you like it or not.

20:44.690 --> 20:47.920
Somebody better attack me soon.
I can't take much more of this.

20:54.289 --> 20:56.990
- What are you waiting for?
- I don't think it'll fit.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.569
Yes, it will. Put it on.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.220
I don't need a helmet.

21:02.690 --> 21:05.670
It's the law.
Do you want us to get pulled over?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.009
No.

21:08.690 --> 21:10.579
Then what's the problem?

21:11.089 --> 21:12.910
Well, it's just, you know...

21:14.089 --> 21:16.970
...the visibility issue and
the hat-head thing--

21:17.690 --> 21:19.789
Why do I get
the lady's helmet?

21:20.089 --> 21:22.339
Stop being a wanker and put it on.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.380
Looks good. Hop on board, gorgeous.

21:34.490 --> 21:36.740
You'll pay for this.

21:51.289 --> 21:52.339
It isn't here.

21:53.089 --> 21:55.859
New acquisitions are in the garage.

21:56.089 --> 21:58.089
Getting a makeover, I bet.

21:59.089 --> 22:02.460
- What you looking for?
- '67 Plymouth convertible.

22:02.690 --> 22:04.650
Give me a few days.

22:05.089 --> 22:06.769
Cordelia, meet Henry.

22:07.490 --> 22:08.960
New to the neighborhood?

22:10.490 --> 22:14.039
- Someone stole my friend's car.
- '67 Plymouth.

22:14.690 --> 22:16.970
- Wasn't me. Convertible, you said?
- Yeah.

22:17.690 --> 22:20.849
Desmond's your man.
He can't pass up old convertibles.

22:21.890 --> 22:22.730
Come on.

22:23.089 --> 22:25.089
You won't find him at his shop.

22:26.690 --> 22:29.460
Tito's having a party.
Everyone's invited.

22:30.289 --> 22:32.539
Desmond'll be there.

22:33.890 --> 22:36.170
- Where you jack these cars from?
- Around.

22:36.890 --> 22:37.869
They look like neighborhood cars.

22:38.089 --> 22:39.980
Now you want to start something.

22:40.490 --> 22:43.930
Jack cars in Brentwood.
Leave the neighborhood cars alone.

22:44.690 --> 22:48.309
Business is business.
You should mind your own.

22:48.890 --> 22:51.730
I might have to put you
out of business.

22:53.089 --> 22:54.210
Let's go.

23:06.890 --> 23:09.769
- Surprised you didn't wet yourself.
- Him?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.769
He's nothing, Deevak. Name's Gunn.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.559
He thinks he runs this town.

23:15.890 --> 23:17.680
I know who he is.

23:18.289 --> 23:21.099
The trouble he's caused.

23:23.089 --> 23:25.759
Tonight, it ends.

23:43.970 --> 23:48.039
- Gunn, what are you doing here?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

23:48.769 --> 23:50.450
We'll catch up later.

23:51.170 --> 23:54.009
- You should be in the garment district.
- It was dead.

23:54.769 --> 23:56.660
So you thought you'd party?

23:57.170 --> 24:00.750
- It's just a little fun.
- It's you not obeying orders.

24:01.369 --> 24:03.369
We got two men down.
Want to make it three?

24:03.769 --> 24:07.809
Go home. I got things to take care of,
then we can chat.

24:09.170 --> 24:10.539
Go!

24:12.170 --> 24:16.420
Short enough leash, or do you get
all warm on the power-trip thing?

24:17.569 --> 24:19.460
He needs discipline to survive.

24:19.369 --> 24:21.089
Now shut up and stay close.

24:22.369 --> 24:26.269
I'm not one of your toy soldiers
you can just boss around.

24:27.170 --> 24:28.750
I don't even want you here.

24:28.970 --> 24:31.950
Too bad. I am here.
And I don't take orders.

24:32.569 --> 24:36.190
Well, except from Angel.
And he usually asks nicely.

24:37.369 --> 24:39.829
Besides, I know how
to behave at a party.

24:40.369 --> 24:42.440
Trust me, I know how to blend.

24:54.170 --> 24:56.170
Okay, not exactly blending.

24:56.569 --> 24:58.569
I'll just shut up
and stay close.

25:01.970 --> 25:03.619
Hey, stranger.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.089
Hey, girl.

25:06.769 --> 25:08.210
Looking good, Veronica.

25:08.569 --> 25:11.940
We've missed you at the store.
You should stop by.

25:12.769 --> 25:14.210
I've been busy.

25:15.769 --> 25:17.140
Who's your friend?

25:18.769 --> 25:20.099
Who, me?

25:20.569 --> 25:23.410
I'm no friend.
I'm just here on business.

25:24.170 --> 25:25.779
I'm a working girl.

25:27.170 --> 25:28.430
That came out wrong.

25:28.970 --> 25:31.599
Obviously, I'm not a working girl.

25:32.569 --> 25:35.519
Not that I couldn't be if I wanted to.
I could.

25:36.769 --> 25:37.930
That sounded stuck-up.

25:37.970 --> 25:42.289
Not that I could be a working girl
and you couldn't. Far from it.

25:44.569 --> 25:46.009
You'd make a great....

25:48.170 --> 25:50.799
Could you point me
to the hors d'oeuvres?

25:51.769 --> 25:53.349
We're looking for Desmond.

25:54.170 --> 25:55.750
- You seen him?
- He's around.

25:56.569 --> 25:57.509
I'll catch up.

25:57.769 --> 26:01.069
- You better. Don't forget about us.
- Never.

26:12.769 --> 26:15.019
You friends with
every Criminal in town?

26:15.170 --> 26:17.700
- You're assuming they're criminals.
- Aren't they?

26:18.769 --> 26:22.069
Like David Nabit? Think he
got rich by being a good citizen?

26:22.369 --> 26:23.349
Actually, he did.

26:24.170 --> 26:27.819
He made millions creating software
for blind people to surf the Web.

26:28.369 --> 26:31.529
He set up a foundation that donates
$20,000,000 a year...

26:31.970 --> 26:34.220
...to countless charitable causes.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.779
Let me know when some
of that trickles down here.

26:38.569 --> 26:40.640
- There he is.
- Who? Car thief guy?

26:41.569 --> 26:42.619
It's him. Desmond!

26:43.970 --> 26:46.430
G-Man. Can I get you a brew?

26:46.970 --> 26:49.000
You can get me the car you stole.

26:49.369 --> 26:52.420
- What makes you think I did it?
- Don't play with me.

26:53.569 --> 26:56.130
Hey, I had no idea that--

27:36.250 --> 27:37.619
What's happening?

27:39.250 --> 27:40.829
You're bleeding.

27:41.049 --> 27:43.750
I'm gonna take care of you.
Try to relax.

27:49.130 --> 27:52.109
Okay, try to sit up, okay?
Come on, easy.

27:57.289 --> 28:00.380
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.109
She needs a doctor. Now!

28:21.329 --> 28:24.769
- We need a doctor. Where's a doctor?
- This way. Dr. Thomas!

28:25.529 --> 28:26.609
What happened?

28:27.329 --> 28:30.630
Glass in her neck. She took it
out before I could stop her.

28:30.930 --> 28:32.509
It may have hit an artery.

28:33.329 --> 28:36.420
I put pressure on it, but
her pulse is weakening.

28:36.930 --> 28:38.539
- She passed out.
- Will she be okay?

28:38.730 --> 28:40.690
- Let us take care of her.
- Will she?

28:41.130 --> 28:45.380
Your friend saved her life, but we
still have work to do. Let us do it.

28:46.529 --> 28:48.529
Come on, she's in good hands.

29:27.329 --> 29:28.380
She almost died.

29:29.130 --> 29:30.920
- But she didn't.
- No thanks to me.

29:31.529 --> 29:32.829
It's not your fault.

29:33.329 --> 29:35.400
I let my guard down, and she--

29:39.930 --> 29:41.369
They were coming after me.

29:42.329 --> 29:43.490
- Take it easy.
- I can't.

29:43.529 --> 29:45.349
I can never take it easy.

29:45.930 --> 29:48.980
When I do, someone like Alana
pays the price.

29:50.130 --> 29:51.809
Alana?

29:56.730 --> 29:58.339
Veronica.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.599
I can't stop.

30:02.130 --> 30:03.920
I can't ever stop.

30:08.130 --> 30:10.130
Don't you move a muscle!

30:11.130 --> 30:12.670
Where is my car?

30:34.650 --> 30:37.529
Excuse me. Do you know Charles Gunn?

30:38.250 --> 30:40.500
Someone said we might find him here.

30:41.849 --> 30:43.569
No, I don't know.

30:43.650 --> 30:44.950
Maybe he got hurt.

30:45.450 --> 30:48.359
- You look like you're hurt.
- No, I'm fine.

30:49.049 --> 30:50.170
What happened here?

30:51.450 --> 30:54.079
I'm not sure.
It all happened so fast.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.910
I don't know who
they were looking for...

30:57.450 --> 31:00.079
...but they were strong,
like they were on drugs.

31:01.049 --> 31:02.730
I just need to lie down.

31:02.849 --> 31:05.099
If you've suffered a head injury--

31:05.849 --> 31:07.880
No, I'm okay. Really.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.460
I was lucky, compared to the others.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.579
You sure you're okay?

31:13.049 --> 31:14.940
Yeah. Thanks.

31:16.049 --> 31:17.279
Good.

31:19.650 --> 31:21.400
Now start talking, huh.

31:33.450 --> 31:36.960
There is a God. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

31:38.250 --> 31:41.200
You drive it out of here,
I'll follow you home.

31:41.849 --> 31:43.920
Just as soon as I find the keys.

31:45.450 --> 31:47.380
You don't have the keys?

31:48.450 --> 31:51.890
I left them in the car when
I went in to save you.

31:53.250 --> 31:56.339
- Every second counted.
- You are one high-maintenance chick.

31:56.849 --> 31:58.990
The keys are here. Somewhere.

31:59.849 --> 32:01.390
You are killing me!

32:03.450 --> 32:05.339
Can't you hot-wire it?

32:05.849 --> 32:07.390
I am not a car thief.

32:07.650 --> 32:10.809
Well, High-Moral-Ground Boy,
help me find them.

32:13.049 --> 32:14.799
Looking for these?

32:18.450 --> 32:19.039
Go.

32:19.650 --> 32:20.309
- Not a chance.
- Go!

32:20.849 --> 32:22.430
I'm not leaving you!

32:22.650 --> 32:25.670
How touching. A woman willing
to die with her man.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.670
He's not my man, he's just a friend.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.759
About the willing to die part--

32:31.049 --> 32:33.650
You must be Deevak. Damn, you're ugly.

32:34.650 --> 32:36.609
And you're the big bad Gunn.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.069
Heard you were looking for me.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.230
Hey!

32:43.049 --> 32:44.279
You found me.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.940
How's it feel to meet up with
someone even nastier than you?

32:52.049 --> 32:53.349
Not good, by the sound of it.

32:53.849 --> 32:55.390
Stop it! You're killing him!

33:01.049 --> 33:02.869
Survival of the fittest, bro.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.440
Right now, you don't look too fit.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.029
Oh, my God.

34:30.489 --> 34:31.750
Cordy, ax!

34:57.530 --> 35:01.389
Angel? Angel, look. I found your keys.

35:02.929 --> 35:05.630
This substance doesn't appear
to be coming off.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.369
- What is that?
- Demon blood.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.869
Or demon pus. Or possibly both.

35:10.730 --> 35:12.940
Anyone know how to hot-wire a car?

35:13.730 --> 35:14.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:17.329 --> 35:20.659
You finally saved my life.
Guess I should say thanks.

35:21.530 --> 35:22.400
Yes, you should.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.769
- And no, I didn't.
- What?

35:27.530 --> 35:30.269
Deevak wasn't the danger
in my vision.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.159
- He wasn't?
- No.

35:34.130 --> 35:35.500
Then what was?

35:35.929 --> 35:37.369
I'm looking at it.

35:38.329 --> 35:39.909
It's you. You're the danger.

35:40.130 --> 35:42.590
- Excuse me?
- It's how you live your life.

35:43.130 --> 35:45.300
You don't just face danger,
you create it.

35:46.130 --> 35:49.610
You're on a self-destruct mission.
You need help.

35:51.530 --> 35:53.420
I don't buy this
Dionne Warwick crap.

35:53.929 --> 35:55.190
You know it's true.

35:56.329 --> 35:58.360
You need some serious saving.

35:59.929 --> 36:01.789
I've got my work cut out for me.

36:02.329 --> 36:03.659
Is that right?

36:04.130 --> 36:05.139
Well, yeah.

36:05.929 --> 36:08.489
Plan on having me in your
life for a while.

36:08.929 --> 36:11.389
At least until you find some peace.

36:11.929 --> 36:13.230
Could be a while.

36:13.730 --> 36:14.500
That's okay.

36:14.929 --> 36:17.489
Helping people is what me
and my friends do.

36:18.530 --> 36:20.039
Lucky me.

36:20.929 --> 36:21.940
Hey...

36:22.730 --> 36:24.519
...how about that "thank you"?

36:58.050 --> 37:00.440
Honey, you're home.

37:01.650 --> 37:05.199
- Hi.
- You look beat. What's wrong?

37:05.849 --> 37:06.900
Nothing.

37:07.650 --> 37:09.469
You save any lives today?

37:11.849 --> 37:13.289
A few, yeah.

37:13.650 --> 37:16.070
Did any of your friends say thank you?

37:17.250 --> 37:18.619
Not exactly.

37:19.050 --> 37:23.019
Typical. Next time I see them
I'm going to say something.

37:23.849 --> 37:25.710
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

37:26.849 --> 37:30.820
- You give, and you give, and you give.
- I'm used to it.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.969
Always the protector,
never the protected.

37:34.650 --> 37:36.440
I have so much to make up for.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.559
And you have.

37:38.849 --> 37:41.409
You take care of so many people.

37:43.050 --> 37:45.579
But who takes care of you?

37:51.449 --> 37:54.469
- You do.
- That's right, I do.

37:56.250 --> 37:57.480
Come on.

38:00.449 --> 38:01.320
Come on.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.300
Lean back.

38:12.449 --> 38:15.539
Now, you just relax...

38:16.050 --> 38:18.190
...and let Darla take care of you.

38:33.449 --> 38:35.449
- How's that?
- Good.

38:37.650 --> 38:40.179
I'm just getting started, baby.

38:42.449 --> 38:44.170
I know how to please you.

38:47.849 --> 38:50.550
All you have to do is let me.

39:02.849 --> 39:06.289
I could just eat you up.

39:50.730 --> 39:52.340
Thank you. Thank you very much.
