about an undead rebel

08:04.944 --> 08:06.696
Excuse me!
Can I get my popcorn now?

08:06.696 --> 08:08.488
My movie starts

-I'm missing the previews!
-What about my popcorn?

08:14.574 --> 08:16.496
What have you done?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.668
Oh, uh, quality
over quantity?

08:18.668 --> 08:20.290
Get his popcorn!

You're welcome, alt-Papa.

08:38.688 --> 08:40.900
But now I must return
to my own dimension.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.902
Tell alt-Tilly I said hi.

08:42.902 --> 08:44.274
Uh, okay.

Take care of yourself,

So, Gloria, what you
doin' after work?

11:16.055 --> 11:17.847
I've got some guests
coming over to stay
at my apartment

11:17.847 --> 11:19.639
through Sharebnb.

11:19.639 --> 11:22.222
Sharing bees?
Why would you do that?
I hate bees!

11:22.222 --> 11:24.184
What? Of course you
wouldn't know what that is.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.765
Sharebnb is a service

11:25.765 --> 11:27.187
where you rent out
your home to guests,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.609
and in exchange,
they pay you money.

11:29.609 --> 11:31.231
Wait a second!
I'd like to have money,

11:31.231 --> 11:32.772
and I live in a house!

11:32.772 --> 11:34.153
[hyperventilating]

11:34.153 --> 11:35.615
Now that you mention it,

11:35.615 --> 11:37.817
your house would be
perfect for Sharebnb.

11:37.817 --> 11:39.239
[gasps]

11:39.239 --> 11:40.950
Then all we have to do
is give 'em a bed

11:40.950 --> 11:42.121
and make 'em breakfast,

11:42.121 --> 11:43.533
and then the money
just rolls in!

11:43.533 --> 11:45.535
It's so easy!
We gotta do it!

11:45.535 --> 11:47.327
Hold on just a minute,
Cricket.

11:47.327 --> 11:50.129
Money never just
"rolls in."

11:50.129 --> 11:51.381
Eh? Bread roll?

Boo!

11:55.755 --> 11:56.966
It's easy money.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.798
Well, I do appreciate
your initiative,

11:58.798 --> 12:02.051
but my point is
money never just
comes in easy.

12:02.051 --> 12:03.553
You have to work
hard for it.

12:03.553 --> 12:05.014
This is different, Dad!

12:05.014 --> 12:06.686
The house does
all the work for you

Sounds fun.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.150
Great. We're
all takin' a break.

15:41.150 --> 15:42.692
You said you'd
do this thing,

15:42.692 --> 15:44.443

you're doin' it.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.292
Little boy, you sure
know how to entertain.

16:03.292 --> 16:04.584
Aah! [panting]

16:04.584 --> 16:06.676
How'd you guys escape?!
I mean...

16:06.676 --> 16:08.257
We never saw the possum,

16:08.257 --> 16:10.049
but the chase
was exhilarating!

16:10.049 --> 16:12.091
Also, we switched rooms!

16:12.091 --> 16:14.684
This one is just
so much more authentic
than the other one.

16:14.684 --> 16:17.146

in your room?

of you, Cricket.

I just wanted
to let you know,

17:05.404 --> 17:06.906
we love it here so much,

17:06.906 --> 17:09.779
we're extending our stay
to a whole week.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.361

Aah! Tilly!

17:27.006 --> 17:28.087
Sorry, Cricket.

17:28.087 --> 17:29.218
I didn't see you there.

17:29.218 --> 17:30.219
Are you okay?

17:30.219 --> 17:32.341
Ugh! I slept like garbage.

17:32.341 --> 17:34.263
Oh, Tilly,
I don't know what to do.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.806
I barely made it through
one day with these folks.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.348
But if I kick 'em out,
it just proves Dad right.

17:39.348 --> 17:42.231
It'd be great
if they decided
to leave on their own.

17:42.231 --> 17:43.392
Tilly, that's it!

17:43.392 --> 17:45.274
We'll make them
want to leave!

17:45.274 --> 17:46.395
Then the money
will be easy,

17:46.395 --> 17:48.648
and Dad will have
to eat his words.

17:48.648 --> 17:50.239
Yeah, that might be tough,

17:50.239 --> 17:51.901
seein' as how they love
our country-ness,

17:51.901 --> 17:54.073
and we can't help
but be country.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.364
