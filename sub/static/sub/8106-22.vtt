WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.136
She almost took my head off.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.098
Your fault.
You didn't guard your left side.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.027
Point.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.551
Stop, stop, stop!

00:53.011 --> 00:55.096
Addie, you're bleeding.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.058
I never even hit her.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.015
Good morning.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.975
This is funny. People don't...

01:41.101 --> 01:43.227
Not done reading. Go away.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.563
Most likely,
she coughed it up.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.941
Which would mean it's from her lungs.
Drugs, toxins, infection...

01:49.067 --> 01:51.611
No fever and no elevated white count.
Which rules out infection.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.529
And blood panels
found no drugs, no toxins.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.240
The bronchoscopy was pristine.
So much for the lungs.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.493
- Good morning.
- Not yet.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.078
So then, the blood came
from her stomach.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.080
Which would mean
it's an ulcer or a GI bleed.

02:03.207 --> 02:07.001
ER also ran an upper and lower GI.
No occult blood in her stool.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.878
Which means no ulcer
or GI bleed.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.463
Which means it's not from
the stomach, either.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.840
Which means it didn't
come from anywhere.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.888
You guys get to the point where the
blood didn't come from anywhere?

02:19.014 --> 02:21.390
Rupture in her sinus cavity?
Drip through the back?

02:21.767 --> 02:23.810
- Not that much blood.
- Trauma from karate?

02:23.936 --> 02:26.062
No trauma. She kicked
the other guy's ass.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.480
Now a good time?

02:27.606 --> 02:30.024
If you can tell me how blood
can mysteriously appear in a...

02:30.150 --> 02:33.528
Now. This includes you.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.741
What's going on?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.827
Feel free to speculate
amongst yourselves.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.581
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.292
- Why?
- He's afraid of turning into me.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.755
Well, that's a
good enough reason.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.298
Sign here.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.052
Doesn't look promising.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.265
Good luck.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.141
- Thank you.
- That's it?

03:04.268 --> 03:06.102
You're not going to tell him
that we're a family

03:06.228 --> 03:07.812
and families don't
abandon each other?

03:07.938 --> 03:09.480
- You want me to?
- No.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.357
- Would it make any difference?
- No.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.859
Good luck, Dr. Foreman.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.162
So, where were we?

03:25.289 --> 03:27.331
College sophomore
coughing up blood.

03:27.457 --> 03:33.212
Not the case. The speculation. The
palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.630
Did Foreman
get a promotion?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.132
I resigned.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.050
What?

03:38.176 --> 03:42.555
Personally, I can't believe I've had the
same three employees for three years.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.100
Patient could have
a heart problem.

03:46.727 --> 03:52.356
Yes. Life goes on. Look at the eager
beaver combing his hair.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.236
Hyper-dynamic heart could force too much
blood into her lungs.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.654
She coughed up the overflow.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.239
Wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs

04:00.365 --> 04:02.575
because it's traveling
through normal plumbing.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.745
Foreman, go do a stress echo test
to see if he's right.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.373
Cameron? Check out the dorm,
then re-do the ER labs.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.751
I'll get going on
Foreman's farewell party.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.463
Everybody good
with a "Mermaid Under the Stars" theme?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.101
So, why are you leaving?

04:30.062 --> 04:32.229
Or is it just
some sort of power play?

04:32.356 --> 04:35.191
You can have my parking space,
my locker.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.859
Is it about House?

04:37.903 --> 04:40.363
Let me get all sensitive
and confide in you.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.616
Addie? Pedal harder.
Need your heart rate at 170.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.995
Why wouldn't you
want to tell me?

04:48.288 --> 04:51.332
I don't like you.
Never have. Never will.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.750
You want me to
share some more?

04:55.879 --> 04:59.382
Even if you do hate me, if you'd found
another job, you'd tell me.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.302
If House did something
to drive you out of here, you'd tell me.

05:03.428 --> 05:07.932
The fact that you won't tell me means
that whatever the real reason is

05:08.058 --> 05:09.475
you're ashamed of it.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.229
Guys? I'm at 170.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.537
Pulmonary artery looks good.
It's not a heart problem.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.960
- Are you cold?
- No.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.337
- Scared?
- I'm okay. Why?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.048
On your arm.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.684
Addie has goose bumps.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.227
No recovering
from those babies.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.645
You don't have goose bumps
for no reason.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.564
They're a reaction
to the body thinking it's cold.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.149
She wasn't cold.
Her temperature was normal.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.234
But her body thought it was.
Which means...

06:00.360 --> 06:02.153
What? A brain problem?

06:02.279 --> 06:04.071
A messed up hypothalamus
could cause goose bumps,

06:04.197 --> 06:06.198
but they're not going to
cause her to cough up blood.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.325
She has no neurological
issues. She had a shiver.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.618
I think there's an infection.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.371
We've ruled out infection
because no fever, no white count.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.998
I think there's an infection.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.835
Blood goes where it's needed. Infection
likes nice, wet places. Her lungs.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.504
Start treatment. All that cool stuff
for bacterial, fungal,

06:20.630 --> 06:22.089
and atypical infections.

06:22.215 --> 06:26.135
Get a lung biopsy. I want to see
the little bugger up close.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.308
Why is Foreman quitting?

06:32.434 --> 06:34.643
He wants to breed llamas.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.105
Interesting.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.151
You're ashamed
of the reason, too.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.625
No one writes tamoxifen
like you.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.336
Well, I use a "G."

07:01.588 --> 07:03.214
Foreman resigned.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.051
I'm sorry.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.594
It's okay. No biggie.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.555
Right. He give a reason?

07:12.265 --> 07:16.936
He said he didn't want to end up like
me. I had a brilliant retort.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.356
I can't remember
what it was at the moment.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.191
You don't want to
end up like you.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.818
Good point. Can I resign?

07:26.488 --> 07:28.280
What's up with that?

07:29.074 --> 07:31.075
- With what?
- You yawned.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.578
I just told you something interesting,
so you're not bored.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.331
It's 11:00 in the morning, you're
drinking coffee, so you're not tired.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.334
I didn't yawn, so it's not
a mirror-neuron reaction.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.547
Which leaves symptom.
Vasovagal issue, maybe a heart problem.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.423
My heart's fine.
I was up late.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.218
You're just deflecting
having a conversation about Foreman.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.928
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.180
Either you're lying,
or you don't really think he's leaving

07:53.306 --> 07:56.225
or you just jumped
right to acceptance.

07:57.185 --> 08:01.272
I'm sorry. I yawned because I was trying
to communicate boredom.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.109
You could try bargaining
with him. Give him a raise.

08:05.443 --> 08:09.655
How much do you think it would cost
to make him want to be like me?

08:11.575 --> 08:13.534
Thanks for the coffee.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.497
She seems fine.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.750
- She is fine.
- She coughed up blood.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.586
- Past tense.
- She has diarrhea.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.129
From the antibiotics
for the infection.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.381
Lung biopsy says
she doesn't have an infection.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.924
Well, then, you screwed up
the biopsy.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.551
Or you're wrong
about infection.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.344
If I'm wrong,
then so is her body.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.221
Because it obviously thinks
she's got an infection,

08:34.347 --> 08:35.890
or it wouldn't have
gotten better from the antibiotics.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.142
What is pandiculation
symptomatic of?

08:38.268 --> 08:41.103
Yawning is a symptom
of fatigue or cholinergic excitation.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.521
Does this have anything
to do with Addie?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.856
Let's say yes.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.774
Cerebral tumor, epilepsy...

08:45.901 --> 08:48.444
Could also be a medication
reaction to antidepressants

08:48.570 --> 08:50.571
or some meds for
end-stage liver failure.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.198
Let's say no.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.829
You don't want to
leave this job.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.206
Three years you've been here.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.666
You've never once laughed
at anything he said.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.793
Because I wasn't
kissing his ass.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.172
But now, you are?
No. Now, you're nervous.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.175
Uncomfortable about your decision.
Wasn't even that good a joke.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.551
Oh, crap.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.096
Most of your jokes are excellent.
I just meant in comparison.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.225
Shut up. I think she
may not have an infection.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.686
Better deal with her
before she crashes.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.191
- She can't breathe.
- Get off the bed.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.734
Need a crash cart.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.945
What's happening?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.279
Let's get her down. Now.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.159
Pressure's collapsing her lungs.
She's not getting any air.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.167
Oh, my God.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.225
She couldn't breathe because
she had a pleural effusion.

10:01.351 --> 10:05.020
Thoracentesis revealed low protein
count, effusion was transudative,

10:05.146 --> 10:07.856
which means she has cirrhosis of the
liver, or she's in heart failure.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.192
Heart was fine,
liver enzymes were normal.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.612
There's something called "blude"
in the pleural effusion.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.615
Oh. It's not "blude,"
it's blood.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.868
Which is great. Not for her,
but for me.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.288
Because it means
I think it's an infection.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.040
Labs indicated
minute traces of blood.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.626
You can't ignore the blood
because it's a minority.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.585
Can you, Foreman?

10:28.712 --> 10:30.296
If we count the traces
of blood as significant,

10:30.422 --> 10:32.715
the differential
isn't just infection.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.134
Could be lung cancer,
breast cancer, lymphoma...

10:35.260 --> 10:37.511
Great. Go tell her
she's got one of those.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.514
Or you can tell her that we haven't
given her enough antibiotics

10:40.640 --> 10:42.266
for her infection.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.518
Double the dose.
Then check her lungs.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.312
We checked her lungs.
They're clean.

10:46.730 --> 10:50.024
On the outside.
She needs an arteriogram.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.117
It's about my bowel movements.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.744
What isn't, these days?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.913
You sure you want to
be here for this?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.915
We do everything together.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.419
Of course.
A toilet can be a lonely place.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.254
Drop your pants. I'll suit up.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.009
- They float.
- Huh?

11:17.135 --> 11:21.430
My bowel movements. Honey says
they're not supposed to?

11:22.098 --> 11:23.974
I'm a nutritionist.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.644
Yes, I could tell from
the cool toe-loop sandals.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.482
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.527
And the natural fiber
clothing, I assume,

11:35.653 --> 11:37.613
means some kind of
vegetarian denomination?

11:37.739 --> 11:38.572
We're vegans.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.866
At first, I was a little concerned
about the lack of protein

11:40.992 --> 11:43.118
but Honey showed me
you can get it from lots...

11:43.244 --> 11:45.454
Well, whatever floats
your poop.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.540
And you've been together
how long? Six months?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.292
How did you know?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.087
Because after six months,
poop love fades

11:53.213 --> 11:56.507
and if you'd been together
shorter than that, then...

11:57.133 --> 11:59.802
I'll explain
right after this break.

12:05.767 --> 12:09.311
Three 10-milligram pills
of your finest amphetamines.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.314
Arteriogram was normal.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.400
Which means
her lungs are fine.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.695
What if the clear
arteriogram is significant?

12:18.822 --> 12:21.365
It is significant.
It means there's no infection.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.825
I think there's an infection.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.076
Infections don't
come and go.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.161
People don't get better then worse
on the same treatment.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.913
Unless her body can't
finish off the fight.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.915
Maybe goes a couple of rounds,
then gives up.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.083
Why would it give up?

12:31.209 --> 12:33.085
Maybe its name is Foreman.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.295
Come on. Where's that smile?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.381
That laugh that makes
the whole world sunny

12:37.507 --> 12:40.134
without contributing
to global warming?

12:42.554 --> 12:43.846
Maybe she's missing a protein.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.140
Blood panel and enzymes
show her proteins are normal.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.516
You can't have tested
for every protein.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.060
I can think of at least one
you can't test for at all.

12:50.186 --> 12:54.815
Complement factor-H deficiency.
If she has that, she's dead.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.109
No way to fend off bacteria.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.195
She'll get one infection
after another until her body shuts down.

13:00.321 --> 13:04.199
Maybe we can get ahead of the game.
Manage each symptom as it comes up.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.953
Give her five miserable years
instead of six miserable months.

13:08.079 --> 13:11.248
There's no diagnostic test
for complement factor-H deficiency.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.751
So we isolate the cells
that are yummiest for it.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.962
Stick a needle in her eye.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.885
You're cheating on Honey.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.887
What? No. I'm not.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.181
Oh, yes, you are.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.728
It's okay. I get it.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.482
Well, I was
going to say relax.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.568
But, oddly enough, you seem
pretty relaxed already.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.570
You're accomplished.
You're funny.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.405
You can have whatever you want.
Women are gonna...

13:43.531 --> 13:45.866
He's not cheating
with another woman.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.910
He's cheating with
another food group.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.411
What?

13:49.537 --> 13:52.164
His floaters float
because they're full of fat.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.083
Probably had a big
cheeseburger for lunch.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.377
You're eating flesh?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.338
It's just a hamburger.
Not all the time...

13:59.464 --> 14:00.339
You're disgusting.

14:00.465 --> 14:04.343
Soy cakes taste like cardboard.
Unsalted cardboard.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.554
I'm accomplished. I'm funny.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.599
Can I have whatever I want?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.568
Can we wait a second?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.279
- What's wrong?
- I feel good.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.906
Do you really need to
put that needle in?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.492
You felt good yesterday,
and then you almost suffocated.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.203
And you know that,
that thing is in my eye?

14:31.329 --> 14:32.746
We think it could be.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.374
If we find it,
the hope is that we can treat it.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.210
- You hope?
- Mom. Don't hang on every word.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.088
He said he hopes.
That means he doesn't know.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.340
I just want to understand
what's going on.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.009
We won't know anything
until we do the test.

14:46.970 --> 14:50.430
Addie, this all looks really scary,
but you'll feel nothing. Okay?

14:50.557 --> 14:51.723
Okay.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.859
- You rang?
- You called me.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.236
I bought you an espresso.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.155
You've been buying me coffee
for a couple of weeks.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.407
I thought I'd
pay you back with one.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.163
How did you walk with the cane
and the two coffees?

15:57.790 --> 15:58.957
Why are you suspicious?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.752
Because it's either that, or accept the
fact that you've done something nice.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.170
And then I have to deal
with the horsemen

16:03.296 --> 16:05.339
and the rain of fire
and the end of days.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.798
You think I spat in yours?

16:07.216 --> 16:08.550
Or worse.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.137
I stacked them.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.454
What do you think of me hiring a
nutritionist instead of a neurologist?

16:37.789 --> 16:39.247
I mean, they sound
almost the same.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.375
I take it you've met
a hot nutritionist.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.918
Don't cheapen this.

16:43.044 --> 16:46.672
We had an in-depth
conversation about proteins and fats.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.217
I was about to
examine her boyfriend's rectum.

16:50.343 --> 16:54.054
You asked for a date while your finger
was in her boyfriend?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.180
I got her number.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.307
No. No. No way.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.395
This is an employment
application.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.648
She doesn't want to go out with you.
She's looking for a job.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.817
Oh, God. She's 26.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.070
But with the wisdom
of a much younger woman.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.617
Have you spoken to Foreman?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.619
Several times. We laughed...

17:17.745 --> 17:18.954
You're going to lose him.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.372
And that will be depressing.

17:20.498 --> 17:24.918
But it will only make me appreciate
all the good things that I do have.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.092
Macular biopsy was negative.
Which means you're wrong.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.177
There's no complement
factor-H deficiency.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.931
Most likely cause of altering blood flow
in the brain is a clot or a tumor.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.475
We can rule out a clotting
issue because she has a bleeding issue.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.185
Which means we should be
looking for a tumor.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.354
I think there's an infection.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.817
Just 'cause the cells in her eye aren't
dead yet doesn't mean they're working.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.152
So, why did we do the test?

17:50.278 --> 17:53.071
Because if it had been positive,
it would have proved I was right.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.657
But negative doesn't
prove you wrong?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.451
That's the beauty of the test.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.661
She needs an MRI of her brain.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.954
Absolutely.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.624
As long as you're scanning,
you mind having a boo for an abscess

18:04.751 --> 18:07.002
for something
caused by an infection?

18:17.972 --> 18:19.973
I didn't expect House
to beg me to stay.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.268
But it seems like he's
in a better mood since I quit.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.229
Nothing in the axial view.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.108
You haven't asked me
why I'm leaving.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.152
I figured you'd tell me
when you wanted to.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.697
I don't want to be like him.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.699
You're not a jerk.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.950
Thank you.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.578
I mean, sometimes you are.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.707
But I don't think we can
pin that on House.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.084
And you're a better doctor
than when you came through the door.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.170
I'm better at some things.
Worse at others.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.964
Again, not House's fault.
It's a job.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.967
We're supposed to take the good
and leave the bad.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.844
It's easier for you.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.932
Why? Because you think
I need to toughen up?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.642
You think I'm weak?

19:04.727 --> 19:05.977
Yeah.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.732
See? I am a jerk.
I've got to get out of here.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.238
What's wrong, Addie?

19:16.364 --> 19:17.656
My head hurts!

19:19.951 --> 19:22.786
Her brain's clean.
No tumor and no abscess.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.872
- We're all wrong.
- My head!

19:32.213 --> 19:37.926
My head!

19:43.599 --> 19:45.267
Grody.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.935
Looks like massive
tissue death.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.980
Who cares? Her head blew up.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.731
- How cool is that?
- It's not pussy.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.149
Meaning you don't think
it's an infection

19:53.901 --> 19:56.069
and you'd be right,
if you weren't wrong.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.112
Here we go again.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.864
She's got infections
that come and go.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.032
- Which means...
- It means it has to be something else.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.492
Good guess. But no.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.996
It either she's got
a leprechaun in her colon,

20:06.122 --> 20:08.081
which is playing
with the doggie door,

20:08.207 --> 20:09.332
letting bacteria in and out,

20:09.458 --> 20:11.960
or she's got complement
factor-H deficiency.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.461
You enjoying this?

20:13.588 --> 20:14.963
I'm saving a woman's life.

20:15.089 --> 20:18.341
I'm saving a woman's life!
Actually, I'm diagnosing her.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.969
Technically, I'm diagnosing her with
something that's going to kill her.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.597
But, other than that,
I'm saving her life.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.932
An autoimmune problem
makes more sense.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.852
You can't explain
a transudative pleural effusion

20:28.978 --> 20:30.312
with giant cell arteritis.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.148
You'd need three whiteboards
and 100 different colored markers.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.610
No, it's much more likely
she has an invisible protein

20:37.028 --> 20:39.154
that allowed bacteria
to arbitrarily invade her lungs

20:39.530 --> 20:43.158
then arbitrarily invade her pleura,
then arbitrarily jump into her head.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.076
If it's autoimmune,
she can live.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.204
But we have to give her steroids, now.
Before her heart ruptures.

20:48.331 --> 20:52.500
If you're wrong, and you give
her steroids, she dies, now.

20:53.878 --> 20:57.547
Foreman. Want to run down how it feels
to go with your gut and kill a person?

20:58.174 --> 21:00.258
You can get into
the whole spiraling out of control,

21:00.384 --> 21:03.428
and the self-doubt,
and the resigning thing.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.890
Do it.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.018
Worst that can happen
is you quit.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.814
Cameron, want to explain
to the parents

21:14.941 --> 21:17.233
why you'll be holding paddles
while he's doing it?

21:17.360 --> 21:20.695
Because if her heart goes "boom",
it will "boom" right away.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.080
She really has to be
awake for this?

21:30.539 --> 21:33.625
If there's a problem,
she could tell us what she feels.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.712
Relax.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.130
We're scared.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.967
I don't want you to be scared.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.387
Then, get better.
Okay, sweetie?

21:46.222 --> 21:47.806
We love you.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.017
I'm sorry.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.815
Ready?

21:58.734 --> 22:00.068
Ready.

22:27.555 --> 22:31.182
My patient's about to have a heart
attack. It's going to be massive.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.308
Oh, wow. That's too bad.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.228
Because I just got tickets to a stroke
on the third floor.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.939
Have you had
a conversation with Foreman?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.191
Do me a favor?

22:40.317 --> 22:41.317
You haven't.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.653
Because then you would have to
confront your own emotions.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.407
Is bile an emotion? Because I definitely
feel something here.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.745
Get me some liquorice. This is going to
be the best heart attack of all time.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.334
Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to shock her.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.352
There's always tomorrow.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.159
You wanted to see me?

23:34.830 --> 23:37.165
Pretty sure the label
is straight.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.168
Are you really going to leave?
Where are you going?

23:40.294 --> 23:41.753
- You lined up interviews yet?
- I'm not sure.

23:41.879 --> 23:45.799
You're pissed at House. I get it.
You're symbolicating killing him.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.677
Symbolicating. What?
Symbolicalating.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.638
- Gosh, that's a hard word.
- Are you okay?

23:51.764 --> 23:54.307
Hey, I'm not the one...
I'm not the one...

23:54.433 --> 23:56.309
I'm not the one
pretending to kill someone.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.145
What would it take for you to stay?
Is it money? He wants you to stay.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.855
- He said that?
- If I said he said that,

24:00.981 --> 24:02.565
would that make a difference?

24:02.691 --> 24:05.151
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Hello?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.445
I'm leaving now.

24:08.906 --> 24:12.075
I'm late for a breast thing.
You know he wants you.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.160
You know he's good.
You know he can make you good.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.037
I don't know what I'm saying.
You know... I don't...

24:16.163 --> 24:19.374
You know what I'm saying. And you know
I'm right. I've got to go.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.918
Sorry it took me so long to
get down here. I'm Dr. Wilson.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.670
I guess Dr. Stein is gone.
Don't worry about it.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.588
I'll talk to him
when we're done.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.091
Dr. Stein said
they're probably calcium deposits.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.469
But with your medical history,
you don't want to take chances.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.598
I can't seem to
put my gloves on today. That's weird.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.688
Okay. Well, that's fine. One's enough.
Well, let's have a look.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.775
You sure talk fast.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.987
This is nothing.
You should see me when we're busy.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.073
I just winked at you. I just... I've
never winked at a patient in my life.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.576
I have no... I am so sorry.
I have no idea what I was thinking.

24:54.702 --> 24:55.535
It's okay.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.619
No, it's not.
I was hitting on you.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.122
I mean, I wasn't... I wasn't consciously
hitting on you, but I...

24:59.248 --> 25:01.374
- What else could you think?
- That you were being reassuring?

25:01.500 --> 25:04.502
Yeah. That would make sense.
On the other hand, I...

25:04.879 --> 25:06.588
I feel like my heart's
going to explode.

25:06.714 --> 25:07.797
Are you okay?

25:08.215 --> 25:09.549
I feel a little sweaty.
Am I sweating?

25:09.675 --> 25:10.758
Yeah.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.386
- Is something wrong?
- I can't...

25:14.096 --> 25:17.307
I put on gloves to do
a breast exam. Perfect. Sorry.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.231
It's 185.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.192
One eighty-five.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.527
One eighty-five?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.781
Excuse me.
I have to go kill someone.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.077
You dosed me!

25:39.205 --> 25:42.582
Yes, I did. But only because
you didn't trust me.

25:42.708 --> 25:43.708
Your best friend!

25:43.834 --> 25:45.084
You could have killed me!

25:45.211 --> 25:46.628
Amphetamines aren't
going to kill you.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.213
You don't know
my medical history!

25:48.339 --> 25:50.506
I could have...
I could have...

25:51.050 --> 25:52.467
You could have given me
a heart attack!

25:52.593 --> 25:56.179
A heart attack is not going to kill you.
You were in a hospital.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.722
You yawned!

25:58.641 --> 25:59.849
You tried to kill me!

25:59.975 --> 26:02.727
I put you on uppers
and you still yawned.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.980
Means it's a symptom
of being a big, fat liar.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.566
Yawning is a side effect
of some anti-depressants.

26:08.692 --> 26:09.776
Apparently,
the ones you're on.

26:09.902 --> 26:13.154
I'm not on anti-depressants,
I'm on speed.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.240
That means it's a symptom
of a cerebral tumor.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.200
You got six weeks to live.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.954
Mr. Well-adjusted is as messed up
as the rest of us.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.497
Why... Why would you
keep that a secret?

26:22.623 --> 26:25.250
Are you ashamed of recognizing
how pathetic your life is?

26:25.376 --> 26:28.169
It's not a secret.
House, it's... It's...

26:29.588 --> 26:30.797
It's personal.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.966
- How long has it been personal?
- It's personal.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.510
Yawning is recent.
So, either you just started,

26:35.636 --> 26:37.470
- or you changed prescriptions.
- This is why I take them.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.265
They're anti-depressants,
not anti-annoyance-ants.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.517
You'd think this would
naturally come up in conversation.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.769
Oh, don't act hurt.
You don't care.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.230
On one of the occasions
when you were pompously lecturing me

26:47.356 --> 26:48.189
on what to do to fix my life.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.608
You wouldn't take them.
You'd rather OD on Vicodin

26:50.734 --> 26:52.735
or stick electrodes in your head,
because you could say

26:52.861 --> 26:54.028
you did it to get high.

26:54.154 --> 26:57.240
The only reason to take anti-depressants
is because you're depressed.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.450
You... You have to admit
that you're depressed.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.160
Give me.

27:01.870 --> 27:02.704
Are you going to admit that...

27:02.830 --> 27:05.498
No, I'm gonna prove
that I'm not depressed.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.880
Well, I can't give you my prescription.
You've got to meet with a psychiatrist.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.466
You... You need
a whole work-up.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.636
Give me a Vicodin
so I don't stroke.

27:29.565 --> 27:32.191
I wouldn't drink that.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.904
My leg hurt, and I...

28:19.239 --> 28:22.367
House, why didn't you
pick up the phone?

28:22.785 --> 28:25.203
- We've been calling.
- I was sleeping.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.126
What did you do?

28:33.170 --> 28:34.587
Nothing.

28:34.713 --> 28:38.091
This is how regular people look
when you wake them up.

28:39.676 --> 28:43.012
Chase was wrong.
Addie's kidneys shut down.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.111
Hemolytic uremic syndrome
shut down Addie's kidneys.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.239
Peripheral smear of red cells
had schistocytes.

29:02.825 --> 29:07.370
HUS is usually caused by an infection
or protein deficiency.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.205
What a coincidence.

29:09.331 --> 29:12.417
I know a patient with an infection
and a protein deficiency.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.877
Do you think it's possible
there's a connection?

29:15.003 --> 29:18.089
I want to hear you say it,
Chase. It will please me.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.508
Doesn't mean you're right.
You predicted cardiac arrest,

29:20.634 --> 29:22.176
instant cardiac arrest.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.137
There were only two choices.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.264
Since yours was wrong,
mine must have been right.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.890
Either that,
or we missed the leprechaun.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.350
If you're right,
there's nothing to be done.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.144
The steroid treatment
we gave her means

29:31.270 --> 29:32.895
when the next infection hits,
it will hit hard.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.106
Liver failure, cardiac arrest.

29:35.232 --> 29:38.359
On the bright side
it confirms my diagnosis.

29:41.530 --> 29:45.366
Don't you see how incredible
this call was? A protein deficiency.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.535
It can't be tested.
Can't be seen.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.745
I called it based
on coughing blood.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.873
You're happy about this.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.124
She's going to die.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.750
That's not my fault.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.711
She was going to die, anyway.

29:56.837 --> 29:59.088
And now, thanks to me,
at least she'll know why.

29:59.214 --> 30:02.467
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude
in her eyes when you tell her.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.760
I'm not telling her.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.305
No one's telling her.
Not until we're sure I'm right.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.515
But we're waiting for her
to stroke or have a heart attack

30:09.641 --> 30:12.101
to confirm before we tell her?

30:12.227 --> 30:14.479
Seems like
the humane approach.

30:57.731 --> 31:02.902
Her heart went into V-fib.
Brought her back, barely.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.696
Congratulations,
you have your confirmation.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.458
What's her name?

31:19.127 --> 31:21.212
- Who? The co-ed?
- Sure.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.092
Dead sophomore girl?

31:26.635 --> 31:28.302
You know her father's name?

31:28.428 --> 31:30.888
Dad. Her mother's name
is Mommy.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.892
Ben and Jody are about to lose
their only daughter, Addie.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.395
You think that they're
gonna give a crap if I know their names?

31:37.729 --> 31:40.147
Five years from now, when the father's
looking at photographs

31:40.274 --> 31:42.358
of his daughter
graduating from high school,

31:42.484 --> 31:44.235
they're not going to remember
the nice black doctor

31:44.361 --> 31:46.571
who called them
by their first name.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.325
You don't wanna quit.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.413
You saying you
don't want me to quit?

31:55.706 --> 31:57.206
Didn't sound like I said that.

31:58.083 --> 32:02.628
I'm saying that suddenly you're trying
to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.089
Because you know who you are.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.300
And you figure if you
can make me decent and caring,

32:07.426 --> 32:08.551
then maybe there's hope for...

32:08.677 --> 32:13.055
You're about to tell a girl she's dying
and you think it's about you.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.518
God, I hope I'm not you.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.747
I'm sorry.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.586
Addie, you're dying.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.465
Are you sure?

32:48.133 --> 32:48.966
Yes.

32:50.636 --> 32:54.805
Your infections will get worse.
The toxins will spill into your blood.

32:55.766 --> 32:56.766
How long?

32:57.351 --> 32:59.727
Two days, maybe less.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.062
You have a condition called...

33:01.188 --> 33:03.064
Does it matter?

33:04.650 --> 33:07.902
It's a very rare protein deficiency
that only manifests...

33:08.028 --> 33:09.654
I don't want to hear it.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.161
Okay.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.556
It's what's killing you.
This is what's killing you.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.392
You're not interested
in what's killing you?

33:39.810 --> 33:42.978
Will it make any difference?
Will I live any longer?

33:43.105 --> 33:44.980
Please, could you just leave?

33:45.107 --> 33:48.484
What's the point in living without
curiosity? Without craving the...

33:48.610 --> 33:52.905
So, I'm screwing up my last few hours
because I won't listen to you?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.408
Get out of here.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.161
It's... It's like the
dark matter in the universe.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.080
You're smiling.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.749
No, I'm not.

34:04.376 --> 34:08.170
You can only diagnose
a problem by looking at what's...

34:10.716 --> 34:12.049
Missing.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.303
Oh, God.

34:18.515 --> 34:20.057
I have to go.

34:25.856 --> 34:29.358
Nineteen-year-old didn't want to
hear the coolest explanation

34:29.484 --> 34:32.695
of why she's going to die,
begged me to shut up.

34:33.113 --> 34:36.031
If you can't shut up,
at least talk quietly.

34:36.324 --> 34:40.286
Amphetamine withdrawal's
a bitch. She thought that I was happy.

34:43.957 --> 34:46.917
- You were happy?
- No, I was hazy.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.963
And I don't get hazy on Vicodin,
or anything else I throw down.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.548
Which means
I was throwing down something

34:52.674 --> 34:55.134
I didn't know I was throwing down.
Which got me to wondering...

34:55.260 --> 34:57.219
Why didn't you give me
those happy pills?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.013
I told you.
You've got to be checked out by...

34:59.139 --> 35:01.599
No, you just didn't
want me double-dosing.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.269
You dosed me!

35:06.062 --> 35:07.730
Those coffees...
They worked!

35:07.981 --> 35:10.608
You've been smiling,
relaxed, happy.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.985
A dying girl thought
I was happy.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.237
A moron thought I was happy.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.031
Who the hell doesn't
want to know why she's dying?

35:17.157 --> 35:19.074
- House was happy.
- Hazy.

35:19.201 --> 35:20.201
- Happy.
- Hazy!

35:20.327 --> 35:23.621
Oh, right.
A dying girl mistook hazy for happy.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.790
Because dying people
see happiness everywhere.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.666
- She's miserable.
- She wasn't miserable.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.460
Of course she was miserable.
You just told her...

35:29.586 --> 35:38.177
She was no different
than she'd ever been.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.306
Oh, God.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.017
I gotta go.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.318
Need a minute
with your daughter.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.403
Dr. House,
get out of here before...

35:56.530 --> 35:58.447
She's gonna live.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.325
Does that help? Now, get out.

36:01.451 --> 36:02.493
Are you jerking us around...

36:02.619 --> 36:04.119
Get out.

36:14.130 --> 36:17.550
You have got
leprechauns in you.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.930
Depression manifests
in lots of different ways.

36:23.223 --> 36:26.141
Some people can't
get out of bed all day,

36:26.268 --> 36:29.812
others have serial relationships
and become oncologists.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.481
I'm dying, I'm not depressed.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.400
Wrong. And wrong.

36:34.985 --> 36:38.779
You tried to kill yourself
by throwing down kitchen cleanser.

36:40.574 --> 36:44.410
Now, most normal suicidal morons
would have just drank the stuff.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.162
Burned the hell out
of their mouth and throat.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.039
Painful, but not deadly.

36:49.165 --> 36:52.167
But being a college-educated
suicidal moron,

36:52.294 --> 36:55.254
you wrapped it in
gel caps or gum.

36:55.380 --> 36:59.049
Which left no trace,
but it burned a hole in your intestine.

36:59.259 --> 37:03.304
But the body can repair
almost anything, which is cool.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.515
In your case, scar tissue
closed up the hole.

37:06.641 --> 37:10.144
But it also formed a bridge
between a vein and an artery.

37:10.770 --> 37:14.106
Now, veins are supposed to help the
intestine flush bacteria away.

37:14.357 --> 37:18.110
But the bridge allowed
the bacteria entrance to the artery.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.280
Where they got
a free ride everywhere.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.036
Can you fix me?

37:30.332 --> 37:33.751
Surgery to fix the bridge'll
take about two hours.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.379
The psychotherapy's
going to take a little longer.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.969
Why'd you do it?

37:48.308 --> 37:49.934
I don't know.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.938
I've just

37:55.231 --> 37:57.149
never been happy.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.322
Please don't tell my parents.

38:04.157 --> 38:06.617
They'll blame themselves
and it's not their fault.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.577
Please, you can't tell them.

38:13.083 --> 38:18.170
Technically, all you have to do is
promise me that you won't do it again.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.007
Then, legally,
I can't tell them.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.015
I promise.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.018
Yeah, sure.

39:08.596 --> 39:12.307
- We can't thank you...
- Your daughter tried to kill herself.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.603
That's why she's here.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.024
Legally, I'm supposed to
keep that between me and her.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.484
Which makes sense,
she's obviously an adult,

39:22.944 --> 39:25.738
capable of her own
well-reasoned decisions.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.159
You're sure?

39:30.368 --> 39:32.786
If she doesn't die
in the next couple of hours,

39:32.912 --> 39:34.788
yeah, I'm right.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.875
How could she hide this?

39:40.503 --> 39:42.171
Everyone has secrets.

39:45.341 --> 39:48.302
We'll take care of her.
Figure it out.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.347
Make her happy?

39:52.474 --> 39:54.016
We'll get her into therapy.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.939
Might want to try
some meds, too.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.196
Can we call you?

40:08.531 --> 40:10.365
If we have any questions?

40:10.867 --> 40:11.700
No.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.670
- What's up?
- Nothing.

40:24.214 --> 40:26.256
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.552
- House's patient?
- Yeah.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.138
The one that would have died,
if not for him.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.308
- Subtle.
- Thanks.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.689
You're really scared
you'll turn into him.

40:43.066 --> 40:44.191
Don't tell me
I'm better than him.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.943
Don't tell me, take the good
and leave the bad.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.736
Cameron already tried.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.241
I'm telling you
there are worse things to turn into.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.038
It's not worth it.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.521
I didn't think you were
going to show.

41:23.690 --> 41:26.692
Sorry, surgery went
a little late.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.238
So, you really think I have all
the necessary qualifications?

41:32.657 --> 41:36.743
I can't discuss this with a dry mouth.
What do you got there?

41:37.078 --> 41:38.162
Peppermint tea.

41:39.289 --> 41:42.040
I'm going to have
a mug of peppermint tea, please.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.255
This isn't a job interview,
is it?

41:49.507 --> 41:51.466
It's some kind of interview.

41:52.969 --> 41:55.345
You're judging me.
I'm judging you.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.264
You have the upper hand.

41:57.807 --> 42:00.267
I don't know anything
about you.

42:02.979 --> 42:05.022
I'm on antidepressants

42:05.148 --> 42:07.274
because a doctor friend
of mine thinks I'm miserable.

42:07.400 --> 42:11.987
I don't like them, they make me hazy.
I eat meat, I like drugs.

42:12.322 --> 42:15.824
And I'm not always faithful
to the women I date.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.119
You don't seem depressed.

42:20.038 --> 42:24.249
You do realize you just skipped over
several deep character flaws

42:24.375 --> 42:26.335
that most women would
run screaming from.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.378
You told the truth.

42:28.504 --> 42:31.548
Yeah, I don't always do that,
either.

42:33.635 --> 42:34.843
Well, how miserable
can you be,

42:34.969 --> 42:37.387
saving lives, sleeping around,
and doing drugs?

42:40.058 --> 42:42.684
Were you on the debating team
in high school?

42:46.981 --> 42:49.816
Also, I hate

42:51.319 --> 42:52.444
tea.
