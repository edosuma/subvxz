Leng Feng Male

00:56.015 --> 00:57.016
Rank Sergeant

00:57.183 --> 00:58.726
Role Sniper

00:58.893 --> 01:00.895
Because of his unauthorized
action during a mission‎,

01:01.228 --> 01:02.229
the person above shall be given
a penalty of confinement‎,

01:02.396 --> 01:03.856
in accordance with discipline regulations‎.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.665
7th August 2008

01:21.999 --> 01:22.625
According to a tip‎-off‎,

01:22.792 --> 01:23.918
a criminal gang

01:24.085 --> 01:25.086
near the southern border

01:25.252 --> 01:25.586
is running a massive operation

01:25.753 --> 01:27.296
smuggling drugs inside carriers' bodies‎.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.547
Their means are cruel

01:28.714 --> 01:29.757
and this is badly effecting the population‎.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.717
The authorities decided to sent a special force

01:31.884 --> 01:32.927
to co‎-operate

01:33.094 --> 01:34.303
with the local anti‎-drug police

01:34.470 --> 01:36.388
In tracking down the criminal gang‎.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.370
Operational preparations complete‎.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.123
Ready to attack

02:27.773 --> 02:28.649
Action‎.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.563
Attack with frontal assault‎.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.513
Brother‎. Help me‎, brother‎.

03:42.348 --> 03:43.557
Help me‎.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.227
You are surrounded‎.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.394
All people in the building‎,

03:47.561 --> 03:48.229
drop your weapons now‎.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.146
Don't shoot‎. Don't shoot‎.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.231
Don't shoot‎. I'm coming out now‎.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.315
I'm coming out‎.

03:51.857 --> 03:52.900
It's nothing to do with me‎.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.109
Don't shoot‎.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.819
Ar‎!

03:56.237 --> 03:57.446
Get me a car‎!

03:57.738 --> 03:59.114
I want a car now‎!

03:59.406 --> 04:00.991
Back off‎!

04:02.826 --> 04:04.954
This building was built in the 60s‎.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.039
It was used to keep hazardous materials‎.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.126
The whole building has been specially reinforced‎.

04:11.335 --> 04:12.836
The walls are made of ferroconcrete‎.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.338
Its Mohs hardness scale is 8‎.

04:14.505 --> 04:15.589
The weapons of ours

04:15.756 --> 04:16.757
cannot penetrate it‎.

04:16.923 --> 04:17.882
It would be a massacre

04:18.050 --> 04:19.635
if we use heavy calibre anti‎-materiel weapons

04:19.802 --> 04:21.178
in an urban anti‎-terrorist mission‎,

04:21.345 --> 04:23.806
so we didn't carry

04:25.182 --> 04:26.308
Cease fire‎.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.518
Everyone stop attacking‎.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.103
Go back‎!

04:29.728 --> 04:31.939
Why did you shoot without authorization‎?

04:32.147 --> 04:33.357
Sir‎,

04:33.524 --> 04:34.400
comrades were down‎.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.609
Cannot wait

04:36.110 --> 04:37.653
Your request is negotiable

04:37.820 --> 04:39.655
First‎, release the hostage

04:39.822 --> 04:41.323
You are trying to win more time‎, aren't you‎?

04:42.408 --> 04:44.159
I want a car‎.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.301
If it happens again‎,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.344
will you do the same‎?

05:05.889 --> 05:06.473
What was that‎?

05:07.766 --> 05:08.434
Who did that‎?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.476
Who‎?

05:09.935 --> 05:10.811
Sniper‎,

05:10.978 --> 05:12.646
Don't shoot without order‎.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.148
Don't shoot without order‎.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.649
I can shoot his head‎, right now

05:15.816 --> 05:17.067
Calm down‎. Calm down‎. Calm down‎.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.485
What was your feeling‎?

05:20.612 --> 05:22.197
I'm the hostage‎.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.908
Why did you fucking shoot me again‎?

05:26.618 --> 05:27.578
Accident‎, accident‎.

05:27.745 --> 05:28.495
It was really an accident‎.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.497
I can shoot his fucking head right now‎!

05:32.916 --> 05:34.168
Calm down‎.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.974
Leng Feng‎,

05:49.141 --> 05:50.976
wait for your confinement‎!

05:51.518 --> 05:53.187
I wasn't thinking about killing people‎,

05:53.354 --> 05:54.772
but saving people‎,

05:55.439 --> 05:56.482
saving my comrades‎.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.317
It felt good‎.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.818
Were you feeling good‎?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.031
Yes‎.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.366
Killing enemies in battle

06:05.532 --> 06:06.617
is my duty‎.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.160
How confident were you with your shooting‎?

06:08.327 --> 06:09.661
50%‎.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.288
What about the other 50%‎?

06:13.624 --> 06:16.001
There was no other 50% in my case‎.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.378
I won‎.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.379
OK‎.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.339
You can go back now‎.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.340
Excuse me‎, Sir‎!

06:21.507 --> 06:22.216
Yes‎.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.675
Am I going back to my old troop‎?

06:23.926 --> 06:25.427
What old troop‎?

06:25.594 --> 06:26.637
Confinement room‎.

06:28.263 --> 06:34.395
"Somewhere Southeast Asia"

06:47.032 --> 06:47.950
Min Deng‎,

06:48.200 --> 06:49.076
you are under arrest

06:49.243 --> 06:51.495
For drug trafficking‎, human trafficking

06:51.995 --> 06:54.748
weapon smuggling and aiding terrorist activities‎.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.084
You have the right to remain silent‎.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.252
Anything you say

06:58.419 --> 07:01.255
can and will be used
against you in a court of law‎.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.257
Brother‎,

09:50.424 --> 09:52.384
Finally‎, I did something big for you‎.

09:52.551 --> 09:53.594
Come back‎. Now‎!

09:53.760 --> 09:54.428
Brother‎, come on‎.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.638
I was always so sure that I can help you‎.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.764
Wu Ji‎, run‎!

09:58.265 --> 10:00.601
You may have already been surrounded
by the Chinese Police

10:01.268 --> 10:02.102
Brother‎,

10:02.561 --> 10:03.437
don't try to scare me‎.

10:03.604 --> 10:04.938
What Chinese Police‎?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.189
Police‎!

10:06.356 --> 10:06.982
Where‎?

10:07.149 --> 10:08.108
Police‎!

10:08.275 --> 10:09.443
Police is here‎!

10:10.694 --> 10:12.487
Brother‎, help me‎! Brother‎!

10:12.529 --> 10:13.447
Help me‎.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.782
Who did the shooting‎?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.034
I'm the hostage‎.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.118
Who did the shooting‎?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.078
How could you shoot at the hostage‎?

10:25.500 --> 10:28.295
My brother was just a child could never grew up‎.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.340
So eager to prove himself

10:33.884 --> 10:36.345
so he rashly ran into China‎,

10:37.429 --> 10:40.349
trying to prove himself to me

10:41.141 --> 10:42.309
He never thought

10:44.478 --> 10:46.647
that he would die in China‎.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.988
A Chinese guy‎?

10:55.656 --> 10:57.366
Don't look down upon China‎.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.577
When you meet them‎,

11:01.036 --> 11:03.455
you will know what you are up against‎.

11:03.705 --> 11:04.665
China

11:05.499 --> 11:07.793
That is the red zone of you mercenaries

11:08.418 --> 11:09.836
When they meet me‎,

11:11.088 --> 11:13.423
they will know what they are up against‎.

11:38.907 --> 11:39.658
Some people think

11:39.825 --> 11:40.951
A soldier could never disobeys his order‎,

11:41.451 --> 11:42.452
other wise he should take off his uniform

11:42.619 --> 11:43.787
and go home‎.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.539
Some others think

11:45.706 --> 11:47.541
that you should be promoted exceptionally

11:47.708 --> 11:49.292
and make you an elite in the army‎.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.547
I think

11:54.256 --> 11:56.049
you have 50% chance

11:56.216 --> 11:57.551
to be kick out of the army‎,

11:57.718 --> 11:59.469
I think I have 50% chance

11:59.636 --> 12:00.637
to stay in the army‎.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.098
There is no other 50% in my case‎.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.274
Ever heard of wolf warrior detachment

12:18.155 --> 12:19.072
Yes‎.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.201
It is the blue force in the Special Forces of PLA‎.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.245
And‎?

12:25.746 --> 12:26.705
Walf warrior detachment

12:27.080 --> 12:29.499
is formed by the elite of the PLA Special Forces‎.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.251
They are equipped with the best weapons‎,

12:31.543 --> 12:33.253
simulate tactics of foreign special forces

12:33.462 --> 12:35.505
and constantly challenge our elite troops‎.

12:35.797 --> 12:36.798
They do whatever they can

12:36.965 --> 12:37.799
to smash them

12:37.966 --> 12:39.092
and temper them‎.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.261
They are the special force in special forces‎.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.188
Report‎!

12:51.646 --> 12:52.939
Drinking is not allowed in the army‎.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.025
Do you think you are still a soldier now‎?

12:56.193 --> 12:57.486
Am I if I drink‎?

12:57.861 --> 12:58.612
Maybe‎.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.322
May I ask who you are‎?

13:00.781 --> 13:01.782
I'm Long Xiaoyun‎,

13:02.365 --> 13:03.950
the current commander of Warwolf Company‎.

13:19.966 --> 13:20.967
Why choose the army‎?

13:21.510 --> 13:22.469
Choosing the army‎, I have regretted for two years‎,

13:22.636 --> 13:24.095
but I would regret my whole life if I didn't‎.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.183
Truth‎?

13:29.434 --> 13:30.268
Truth‎!

13:31.186 --> 13:32.020
Drink more‎.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.407
More‎.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.205
Are you trying to make me drunk
and tell you the truth‎?

13:50.747 --> 13:51.998
Will you tell the truth‎?

13:52.999 --> 13:53.834
Yes‎.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.001
Good‎.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.382
What do you want to know‎?

14:08.098 --> 14:10.392
I want to know what you will be like
when you get drunk‎.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.603
I've never been drunk‎.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.021
I started drinking when I was three‎.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.567
At 5‎,made two boys six years older
than me drunk before I do

14:19.276 --> 14:20.694
At 12‎, I peeped at girls in showers

14:21.236 --> 14:22.320
with some Dutch courage‎.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.697
At 17‎,

14:27.534 --> 14:29.035
What happened when you were 17‎?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.668
Has your father disciplined you‎?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.381
Before I was born‎,

14:41.715 --> 14:45.093
my father left our current home‎.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.304
My mum wanted a baby‎,

14:47.596 --> 14:49.639
so she invited my father over

14:49.848 --> 14:51.433
for a drink‎.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.934
Dad got drunk‎,

14:53.101 --> 14:54.728
and here I am‎.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.605
Stop laughing‎.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.108
Leng Feng‎, How could you fight with others again‎?

15:38.647 --> 15:39.397
Platoon Commander‎,

15:39.648 --> 15:40.941
take the intelligence and go‎.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.859
Don't come over any more‎.

15:44.986 --> 15:45.946
Platoon Commander‎,

15:46.237 --> 15:48.782
send the intelligence back‎!

15:50.909 --> 15:52.035
Platoon Commander‎.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.042
Do your brother a favour‎.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.127
Make it quick‎.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.588
Shoot me‎.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.641
That is a tough one‎.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.018
Everyone in Wolf detachment is tough‎.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.728
We don't want weak ones‎.

17:06.943 --> 17:07.694
Well‎.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.154
See you tomorrow‎.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.696
See you‎, Sir‎.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.556
Ar‎!

19:33.506 --> 19:34.340
My name is Shao Bing‎,

19:34.632 --> 19:35.758
the Deputy Commander of Wolf Warrior detahment‎.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.386
My honor to see you‎, sir‎.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.183
I don't like you‎.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.186
Do you know why we are called Wolf warrior‎?

19:46.519 --> 19:47.270
Wolves

19:48.146 --> 19:49.230
are social animals‎.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.357
One wolf

19:52.025 --> 19:54.235
cannot defeat a lion or a tiger‎,

19:54.986 --> 19:56.029
but a wolf pack

19:56.779 --> 19:58.031
can be invincible‎.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.782
We need teamwork

20:00.617 --> 20:02.160
not lone wolf‎.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.703
or showing off individual abilities‎.

20:04.370 --> 20:04.996
Yes‎, sir‎.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.873
Speaking of individual abilities‎,

20:07.540 --> 20:08.708
my commander told me

20:09.209 --> 20:11.502
that she found a marvelous sniper‎,

20:13.463 --> 20:14.923
but I really can't see

20:15.465 --> 20:16.591
what so marvelous about you‎.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.134
What have you seen‎?

20:18.426 --> 20:19.552
If we were on the battlefield‎,

20:20.261 --> 20:21.721
you would have been surrounded‎.

20:23.348 --> 20:24.891
If you don't have such alertness‎,

20:29.020 --> 20:30.605
how can you be a sniper‎?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.815
If this is the real battlefield‎,

20:33.650 --> 20:35.944
what would be your last words‎?

20:36.653 --> 20:37.362
Sir‎!

20:37.654 --> 20:38.696
That won't happened to me‎.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.281
Why‎?

20:42.242 --> 20:43.701
Here is a barrier‎-free open isolation zone‎,

20:44.077 --> 20:44.953
with armoured cars and

20:45.119 --> 20:45.787
tanks‎.

20:45.954 --> 20:46.913
With such a defence‎,

20:47.080 --> 20:48.581
if dozens of special soldiers from the enemy

20:48.748 --> 20:50.250
could have successfully dug trenches
and conceal themselves‎,

20:50.458 --> 20:51.459
and I just landed

20:51.626 --> 20:53.461
in the middle of the enemy's ambush trap‎,

20:53.836 --> 20:54.837
there could only be one reason‎,

20:55.421 --> 20:57.924
which is you have committed treason
with all your men‎.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.384
To traitors‎,

20:59.550 --> 21:02.512
we usually damn all their ancestors‎.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.473
This is a tough one‎,

21:06.182 --> 21:07.767
like our style‎.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.522
So close to his face‎,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.983
they either begin to flight or begin to kiss‎.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.904
What do you want to say‎,sir‎?

21:22.615 --> 21:23.199
Yu Fei‎.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.284
Yes‎, sir‎.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.493
He is all yours now‎.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.328
Yes‎, Sir‎.

21:30.415 --> 21:31.624
I'm your Squad Commander‎.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.625
My name is Yu Fei‎.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.210
Hello‎, Commander‎.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.713
I like you‎.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.299
Welcome to Wolves‎.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.550
How is this‎?

21:40.925 --> 21:42.468
The welcome ceremony into Wolves‎.

21:42.969 --> 21:43.928
is awesome‎, isn't it‎?

21:44.345 --> 21:45.471
Do you know why‎?

21:46.806 --> 21:47.515
Why‎?

21:48.182 --> 21:49.976
We are the fucking best‎.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.519
Tell this new guy

21:51.811 --> 21:53.479
what the motto of our detachment is

21:53.646 --> 21:55.148
Be humble‎!

21:57.984 --> 21:59.485
I really didn't see‎.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.264
How is everything going now‎?

22:28.431 --> 22:29.640
All goes well‎.

22:29.891 --> 22:30.683
Shi‎,

22:31.017 --> 22:32.685
you gave up your operation room

22:32.852 --> 22:34.687
to that girl‎, Long Xiaoyun

22:35.021 --> 22:37.899
and running around with us in the van‎.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.192
Shi‎,

22:39.609 --> 22:40.818
you have been working hard‎.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.446
Four old fellows

22:43.863 --> 22:45.365
have been knocked out by her raid‎.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.700
I don't want to be the fifth‎.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.371
I need to make my headquarters mobile‎.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.373
I want to see

22:53.581 --> 22:54.957
that there is no Achilles heel‎,

22:55.124 --> 22:57.043
how Long Xiaoyun can make her deadly blow‎.

23:03.841 --> 23:04.675
Leng Feng‎,

23:04.842 --> 23:06.552
tell us your three‎-shoots story‎.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.767
Be careful with your words‎.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.560
Shit Rubberneck‎,
you just can't leave things alone‎.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.231
I'm Shi Rubberneck‎, not Shit Rubberneck‎.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.066
That idiot‎,

23:20.233 --> 23:21.734
on the very first day he came

23:22.068 --> 23:23.403
Questioned in front of everyone

23:23.569 --> 23:25.071
"Why is such a tough troop"

23:25.363 --> 23:27.240
"led by a broad‎?"

23:27.448 --> 23:28.991
He had been tricked for more than 17 times‎,

23:29.158 --> 23:29.951
then he behaved‎.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.077
Be careful with your words‎.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.412
Commander Long is a woman‎.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.788
A woman is a broad‎.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.289
Am I wrong‎?

23:35.581 --> 23:36.582
What's the big deal being‎?

23:36.791 --> 23:38.292
Can't a woman be a commander‎?

23:38.918 --> 23:39.710
In my opinion‎,

23:40.086 --> 23:41.921
there will be no wolves without Commander Long‎,

23:42.088 --> 23:42.797
right‎?

23:42.964 --> 23:43.756
Yes‎,

23:44.090 --> 23:45.258
Rubberneck is right‎.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.259
Eh‎?

23:47.260 --> 23:48.886
you should have already been taught a lesson‎.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.056
In my opinion‎,

23:52.223 --> 23:53.349
what this kind of woman needs

23:53.683 --> 23:55.351
is to be conquered by a man‎.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.271
By which kind of man‎?

23:58.479 --> 24:00.022
A man like me‎.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.441
How‎?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.109
How‎?

24:04.026 --> 24:05.445
Ah‎, ah‎!

24:35.141 --> 24:35.475
Ma'am

24:35.641 --> 24:37.101
We are running into anti‎-aircraft fire‎.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.525
Return to base‎!

24:45.234 --> 24:46.444
Drop the bait‎.

24:53.576 --> 24:53.993
Parachute‎.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.161
Opening altitude 300 metres‎.

24:55.328 --> 24:55.912
Be careful‎.

24:56.078 --> 24:56.662
New man just joined in‎.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.497
Run him in as soon as possible‎.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.915
Yes‎, Ma'am‎.

24:59.624 --> 25:00.333
Sir‎!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.335
Find massive air‎-drop of enemy paratroopers‎.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.088
Commander‎,

25:06.255 --> 25:07.089
this is a tactic used by large formations

25:07.256 --> 25:09.175
during World War II‎.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.177
They are obviously bait‎.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.806
If there are high‎-explosive bombs

25:15.973 --> 25:17.225
and drop on our position‎,

25:17.391 --> 25:19.101
we will have serious casualties‎.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.002
If we fire back‎,

25:45.169 --> 25:47.755
our anti‎-aircraft fire will be exposed‎.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.757
Then expose all to them‎.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.386
Command the anti‎-aircraft force

25:53.886 --> 25:54.470
to fire all weapons‎.

25:54.845 --> 25:55.638
Yes‎, Sir‎.

26:00.226 --> 26:00.851
Sir‎!

26:01.060 --> 26:02.562
We got the command authority of the blue force‎.

26:03.854 --> 26:04.397
Ma'am

26:04.564 --> 26:05.189
The red force has penetrated

26:05.356 --> 26:06.899
our operational command system‎.

26:07.066 --> 26:07.733
And‎?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.568
We have lost

26:08.734 --> 26:10.528
the command authority to the combat troops‎.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.252
Contact the artillery regiment now‎.

26:26.419 --> 26:26.794
Yes‎, Sir‎.

26:26.961 --> 26:27.712
Wait‎.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.882
When we were trying to penetrate the system‎,

26:32.091 --> 26:32.758
and set up a temporary virtual communication

26:32.925 --> 26:34.635
with the enemy‎,

26:35.261 --> 26:36.429
Long Xiaoyun used the same method

26:36.596 --> 26:38.639
and sent commands to the artillery regiment‎.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.642
One of our mechanised infantry regiments

26:41.934 --> 26:43.811
has been destroyed by our own artillery regiment‎.

26:43.978 --> 26:44.729
Interesting‎.

26:44.895 --> 26:45.605
Yun‎,

26:45.771 --> 26:46.939
well done‎.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.275
What's more interesting is that

26:49.483 --> 26:51.527
this girl also has installed a virus

26:51.694 --> 26:52.945
in our operational command system‎.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.947
If we made the call just now‎,

26:55.239 --> 26:56.073
we would be bombed

26:56.324 --> 26:58.242
within three minutes‎.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.952
The game has just begun

27:09.629 --> 27:10.296
Shi‎,

27:10.963 --> 27:13.299
you can directly command the blue force now‎.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.595
Copy the operation mode of foreign special forces‎.

27:17.928 --> 27:18.929
I have been studying how to deal
with foreign forces

27:19.221 --> 27:21.057
for the last twenty years‎.

27:30.983 --> 27:31.442
Ma'am

27:31.609 --> 27:32.943
Find a military unit the same size as a regiment‎.

27:33.110 --> 27:33.527
Ma'am

27:33.694 --> 27:35.821
Find another two military units
the same size as regiments‎.

27:38.991 --> 27:39.575
Fake‎.

27:39.742 --> 27:40.493
Ma'am

27:40.785 --> 27:42.828
We lost contact with the Deputy Commander‎.

28:17.738 --> 28:18.698
Commander Long‎,

28:18.864 --> 28:19.907
please reply if you hear this‎.

28:20.074 --> 28:21.200
Please reply if you hear this‎.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.038
It looks really fake‎.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.874
They want us to think this is a fake one‎,

28:29.625 --> 28:30.876
so they left the real one here‎.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.503
Let's check it out‎.

28:33.003 --> 28:33.963
Attention‎,all units

28:35.214 --> 28:36.382
Move fast‎.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.216
When your missions is done‎,

28:37.383 --> 28:38.217
muster at the assigned place‎.

28:38.384 --> 28:38.884
Yes‎, Sir‎.

28:39.051 --> 28:39.969
Wait‎.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.722
What if they want us to think

28:42.888 --> 28:45.057
they would put the real one in the fake one‎?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.936
Are you doubting Commander Long's order‎?

28:50.104 --> 28:51.564
I know the red force's commander‎.

28:52.857 --> 28:54.358
I think it's probably a trap‎.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.736
Follow the orders‎.

28:57.737 --> 28:58.696
Eh‎,

29:00.072 --> 29:01.741
if this is a fake one‎,

29:02.992 --> 29:04.034
The wolf will be lost‎.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.747
The wolf never loses‎.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.126
I had just begun to like you‎,

29:12.960 --> 29:15.004
but now I'm really disappointed with you‎.

29:15.671 --> 29:16.881
Follow the orders‎,

29:17.590 --> 29:18.424
soldier‎.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.596
Leng Feng has just come over from the red force‎.

29:23.763 --> 29:24.930
He must be more familiar with the way they fight

29:25.097 --> 29:26.599
than us‎.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.727
Shall I take Leng Feng and Rubberneck

29:29.894 --> 29:31.437
and support from the perimeter‎?

29:31.854 --> 29:32.688
Eh‎.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.774
When the exercise finishes‎,

29:35.941 --> 29:37.485
you better leave the Wolf‎.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.344
We are so over‎.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.137
I told you it's fake‎.

30:05.888 --> 30:06.889
Armoured cars‎,

30:07.056 --> 30:07.848
tanks‎.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.475
Dozens of soldiers from our special force

30:09.642 --> 30:10.100
have successfully sneaked

30:10.267 --> 30:12.228
into the centre of enemy's ambush trap‎.

30:12.603 --> 30:13.312
Commander Shao‎,

30:13.479 --> 30:16.106
you are taking your men to die
for our country together

30:37.670 --> 30:38.921
He is good‎.

30:39.213 --> 30:40.506
Make him one of us‎.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.508
He is the Deputy Commander of
Wolf warrior detachment

30:42.675 --> 30:44.176
You must get him for me‎.

30:44.677 --> 30:45.553
Withdraw the exploring birds‎.

30:45.719 --> 30:46.387
Yes‎, Sir‎.

30:46.554 --> 30:48.305
We won't be a thing to them

30:48.722 --> 30:50.474
even if we rush down now‎.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.602
It seems like the wolf will lose this time‎.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.548
Shit‎.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.009
Is this a fake one too‎?

31:26.760 --> 31:28.304
Let's check it out‎.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.318
Three‎,

31:42.484 --> 31:43.485
two‎,

31:43.652 --> 31:44.612
one‎.

31:44.778 --> 31:45.821
Arrive‎.

31:51.327 --> 31:52.244
All gone‎.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.098
Keep watching‎.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.233
Brigade Commander‎,

32:23.817 --> 32:25.110
Hello‎, Sir‎.

32:33.702 --> 32:34.662
Brigade Commander‎.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.080
Don't ask me‎.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.082
I'm already dead‎.

32:44.380 --> 32:44.838
Report‎!

32:45.005 --> 32:46.131
The exercise umpire team has judged

32:46.298 --> 32:47.299
that the red force's commander

32:47.466 --> 32:49.635
has been shot to death by our sniper‎.

32:50.094 --> 32:50.511
Li Zhijun‎.

32:50.678 --> 32:51.220
Yes‎, sir‎.

32:51.679 --> 32:52.638
Find them out‎.

32:52.805 --> 32:53.430
Yes‎, Sir‎.

32:53.597 --> 32:54.139
Guard Company‎, follow me‎.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.015
Yes‎, Sir‎.

32:55.182 --> 32:55.808
Switch on the video‎.

32:55.975 --> 32:56.934
Cut off the line‎.

32:57.226 --> 32:58.394
I want Long Xiaoyun to see

32:58.560 --> 33:00.020
her men disappear one by one‎.

33:00.187 --> 33:00.813
Yes‎, Sir‎.

33:06.318 --> 33:06.944
Report‎!

33:07.111 --> 33:08.821
The video communication with
the operating force is back on‎,

33:09.822 --> 33:11.615
but cannot send instructions‎.

33:15.452 --> 33:16.578
Leng Feng‎,

33:17.621 --> 33:19.164
let me interview you‎.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.543
What did you feel when you defeated
your old commander‎?

33:24.211 --> 33:26.547
Will you do the same thing to us‎?

33:28.632 --> 33:29.967
The old commander said

33:31.176 --> 33:32.553
exercises are actual combats‎.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.846
Yo‎,

33:34.179 --> 33:35.139
tell the truth‎,

33:35.305 --> 33:37.141
No one is listening now‎.

33:37.307 --> 33:38.809
We won't trick you again‎.

33:41.478 --> 33:44.815
Exercises are actual combats‎.

33:45.065 --> 33:45.899
Bull shit‎.

33:46.275 --> 33:48.277
Do actual combats fire empty bombs‎?

33:48.527 --> 33:49.945
The reason I joined the army is to fight‎,

33:50.446 --> 33:51.196
What

33:51.488 --> 33:52.406
we fight over and over‎,

33:52.740 --> 33:54.575
as through we are playing a game‎.

33:54.742 --> 33:56.201
Why fight‎?

33:56.493 --> 33:58.829
Nothing is better than staying
with family at home‎.

33:59.621 --> 34:00.622
This is my little princess‎.

34:00.998 --> 34:01.957
Beautiful‎?

34:04.168 --> 34:05.502
Not again‎. Don't show my fiancme's photo

34:05.669 --> 34:07.337
to others‎.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.632
My girl is only two‎.

34:10.799 --> 34:11.842
Leave her alone‎.

34:12.009 --> 34:13.177
Call me dad‎.

34:18.766 --> 34:19.850
Dad‎.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.437
You little bastard‎.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.070
Commander Shao is coming‎.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.161
What's happened‎?

34:39.328 --> 34:40.036
Wolves‎,

34:40.204 --> 34:40.996
wolves are coming‎.

34:41.163 --> 34:41.996
Where are the others‎?

34:42.164 --> 34:43.081
All dead‎.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.342
Yo‎,

34:54.510 --> 34:55.928
it's just a few wolves‎.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.002
Call the nearest helicopter‎.

35:29.253 --> 35:30.629
All the helicopters are controlled
by the red force‎.

35:30.671 --> 35:32.381
Our force is engaging with the red force‎.

35:32.548 --> 35:33.590
Use the public channel

35:33.757 --> 35:34.883
to call the red force's commander immediately‎.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.180
Combat‎-ready helicopters have taken off

35:40.681 --> 35:41.849
and will arrive within thirty minutes‎.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.392
Li Zhijun‎. Li Zhijun‎.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.686
Support the wolf detachment immediately‎.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.229
They are in big trouble‎.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.150
Ready to fight‎.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.375
Fix bayonets‎.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.118
Listen up‎,

37:26.662 --> 37:27.621
We found the target‎.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.039
Yeah‎.

37:29.790 --> 37:33.043
However‎, he is surrounded

37:33.210 --> 37:37.172
by the entire army of the PLA‎.

37:40.884 --> 37:44.554
Every Wolf warrior wants a wife‎,

37:45.222 --> 37:48.809
but we don't have enough girls‎.

37:49.226 --> 37:53.146
You can get a Long Xiaoyun with discipline‎.

37:53.355 --> 37:57.067
You can have a Shi Qingsong with misbehare‎.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.247
Their commander has been shot to death‎.

38:10.414 --> 38:11.373
Why are they still chasing us‎?

38:11.623 --> 38:12.749
Is it fair‎?

38:12.916 --> 38:14.126
Isn't it a revenge for personal reasons‎?

38:14.668 --> 38:16.336
That's not right‎. I'm going to report
this to the officer‎.

38:16.503 --> 38:17.546
You shot your old commander

38:17.713 --> 38:19.172
right after you left your old troop‎.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.257
If I were your Company Commander‎,

38:20.424 --> 38:21.508
I would kill you‎.

38:22.259 --> 38:23.343
The old commander said

38:23.552 --> 38:25.012
exercises are actual combats‎.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.013
Feng‎,

38:26.179 --> 38:27.848
you bad ass‎.

38:38.358 --> 38:39.067
Guys‎,

38:39.443 --> 38:40.360
Let's move faster‎.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.863
I feel strange‎.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.699
My old Company Commander is really black handed‎.

38:59.421 --> 39:00.047
Watch out‎!

39:00.213 --> 39:00.797
Live shell‎!

39:00.964 --> 39:01.506
Live shell‎!

39:01.673 --> 39:02.716
This is not an exercise‎.

39:02.924 --> 39:03.925
Call the headquarters‎.

39:44.758 --> 39:45.759
Freeze‎.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.499
Inform the force

40:17.666 --> 40:18.959
to be at combat readiness‎.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.377
Foreign force crossed the border‎.

40:20.710 --> 40:21.878
Request for armed helicopters‎.

40:22.045 --> 40:22.963
Live shell support needed‎.

40:47.070 --> 40:47.696
Fall back‎.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.322
Their reinforcement is coming‎.

41:41.374 --> 41:42.542
My little princess‎.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.211
Beautiful‎?

42:39.516 --> 42:40.600
They are back‎.

42:41.810 --> 42:43.103
Mount up‎. Let's roll‎.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.155
So

42:54.990 --> 42:55.699
How was he‎?

42:56.408 --> 42:58.285
He's as faulty as his weapon‎.

42:58.451 --> 43:00.120
Ha ha ha ha

43:00.745 --> 43:01.788
That was easy‎.

43:01.955 --> 43:03.623
I'm sure their sewer will kill me

43:03.790 --> 43:05.417
before they actually do‎.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.294
Do not underestimate them‎.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.379
Remember‎, they are unarmed‎.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.339
A simple snatch and grab‎, man‎.

43:11.715 --> 43:13.049
You should've just killed him‎.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.843
Now we just kicked the hornets' nest‎.

43:15.135 --> 43:16.803
Exactly what I want it‎.

43:17.137 --> 43:18.930
Monkey‎, How is E&E looking‎?

43:19.264 --> 43:20.849
Everything is good to go‎, man‎.

43:23.893 --> 43:24.603
Report to No‎. 1‎.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.146
Eagle spots the target‎.

43:31.192 --> 43:33.486
This is the territory of
the People's Republic of China‎.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.530
You are trespassing‎.

43:35.697 --> 43:36.656
I am ordering you

43:36.823 --> 43:37.741
stop the vehicle

43:37.907 --> 43:39.326
and surrender immediately‎.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.162
Things about to get real‎.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.331
Is this a part of your plan‎, too‎?

43:44.497 --> 43:45.707
Gentlemen‎,

43:45.874 --> 43:47.917
the show is about to begin‎.

43:54.841 --> 43:56.217
That was interesting‎.

43:56.676 --> 43:57.719
Let's go‎. Let's go‎.

44:41.680 --> 44:44.557
You have invaded the territory

44:44.724 --> 44:46.059
of the People's Republic of China‎.

44:46.226 --> 44:48.561
Stop the vehicle and give up resistance

44:52.440 --> 44:54.776
This is the territory of
the People's Republic of China‎.

44:54.943 --> 44:56.903
You are trespassing‎.

44:57.070 --> 44:57.737
I am ordering you

44:57.904 --> 45:00.198
stop the vehicle and give up resistance‎.

45:00.824 --> 45:03.034
This is your last warning‎.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.744
Last warning‎.

45:09.457 --> 45:10.250
Move‎.

45:10.417 --> 45:11.710
Let's move‎. Let's move‎.

45:21.261 --> 45:23.096
Report‎! All the devices and
instruments in the helicopter

45:23.388 --> 45:25.181
are down‎, all down‎.

45:34.023 --> 45:35.984
This is a well‎-plotted and targeted armed invasion

45:36.359 --> 45:38.319
started by foreign mercenaries‎.

45:39.612 --> 45:40.697
We are commanded

45:40.989 --> 45:42.449
to stop the exercise and turn to actual combat‎,

45:43.908 --> 45:44.951
co‎-operating with the armed police force

45:45.118 --> 45:46.244
to completely block the border‎.

45:46.661 --> 45:47.662
Comrade Long Xiaoyun‎,

45:47.829 --> 45:49.205
you are taking a part of this mission‎.

45:49.372 --> 45:50.123
Yes‎, Sir‎.

45:50.290 --> 45:52.167
We captured a piece of
a call from a satellite phone

45:52.375 --> 45:54.127
proves that foreign mercenaries have invaded‎.

45:54.294 --> 45:55.587
The mastermind behind is very likely

45:55.754 --> 45:57.589
to be an international broker called Min Deng‎.

45:58.715 --> 45:59.674
Min Deng‎.

46:00.759 --> 46:01.718
He is the brother of Wu Ji‎,

46:01.885 --> 46:02.969
who was shot to death by Leng Feng‎.

46:03.219 --> 46:04.179
What's strange is

46:04.471 --> 46:05.930
according to the signal we captured‎,

46:06.139 --> 46:07.223
he has already crossed the border

46:07.515 --> 46:09.309
and was not far from the border‎.

46:16.232 --> 46:17.317
Where is Tomcat‎?

46:17.734 --> 46:18.735
Where is he‎?

46:19.944 --> 46:21.196
Tomcat is busy‎.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.323
I was told he would be
the escort himself in this mission‎.

46:24.073 --> 46:25.241
What is he doing‎?

46:26.159 --> 46:28.161
Tomcat is busy getting to know

46:28.328 --> 46:29.454
each other with the mouse‎.

46:30.413 --> 46:31.122
Tomcat‎,

46:31.289 --> 46:32.832
Former Seal member‎.

46:32.999 --> 46:35.335
He has been in the Gulf War
and in Afghanistan twice‎.

46:35.502 --> 46:36.044
After his retirement‎,

46:36.211 --> 46:37.796
he has joint in an international
mercenary organisation

46:38.004 --> 46:39.339
and is the most expensive one at the moment‎.

46:39.506 --> 46:40.840
He never failed before‎.

46:41.007 --> 46:41.508
All his members are also retired soldiers

46:41.674 --> 46:43.843
from special forces of different countries‎.

46:49.432 --> 46:51.768
"Chinese Boy Scouts"

46:52.352 --> 46:54.604
Min Deng sent such elite mercenaries here

46:55.355 --> 46:56.856
just because he wants to revenge his brother‎,

46:57.857 --> 46:59.734
just because he wants a Chinese soldier‎.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.528
Min Deng is a businessman‎.

47:01.694 --> 47:02.862
He came across the border himself

47:03.029 --> 47:04.364
and show up at the same time with Tomcat‎.

47:05.532 --> 47:07.492
This is not as simple as that‎.

47:32.725 --> 47:33.393
Hurry up‎!

47:33.560 --> 47:34.644
Faster Move

47:37.146 --> 47:37.897
Stretcher

47:38.189 --> 47:38.857
Move

47:39.232 --> 47:40.400
Be careful

47:40.567 --> 47:41.150
More careful

47:41.317 --> 47:41.651
Report‎!

47:41.818 --> 47:43.695
This is a circuit board that
the plot risked his life for‎.

47:49.742 --> 47:50.702
Graphite powder‎.

47:50.910 --> 47:51.661
They added massive amounts of graphite powder

47:51.828 --> 47:53.079
into the rocket bomb‎.

47:53.288 --> 47:55.039
This kind of thing is only
a thousandth of a millimetre big‎.

47:55.331 --> 47:55.790
Once the bomb explodes‎,

47:55.957 --> 47:57.083
the powder will get into the electric instruments‎.

47:57.333 --> 47:57.876
and make them short circuit‎,

47:58.042 --> 47:59.085
even cause arc burning‎.

47:59.752 --> 48:02.046
It won't be disappeared
in the air in a short time‎,

48:02.213 --> 48:03.298
so aircraft cannot enter the area‎.

48:05.425 --> 48:06.759
Notify the relevant department‎.

48:06.926 --> 48:07.760
Make artificial rain

48:07.927 --> 48:09.095
in the forest‎.

48:09.262 --> 48:09.971
Use heavy rain

48:10.138 --> 48:11.306
to wash out all the graphite powder

48:11.472 --> 48:12.432
within one hour‎.

48:12.599 --> 48:13.099
Yes‎, Sir‎.

48:13.266 --> 48:14.183
As we surmised‎,

48:14.350 --> 48:15.852
Tomcat killed one of our soldiers‎.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.146
He should know that we are going
to block the border‎,

48:18.438 --> 48:20.273
so the only way he could escape

48:20.440 --> 48:21.524
is just this one‎.

48:21.691 --> 48:23.526
This forest was a mine field in former battles‎,

48:23.693 --> 48:25.028
and is still covered with landmines‎,

48:25.194 --> 48:26.779
unexploded ordnance and anti‎-paratrooper hooks‎.

48:26.946 --> 48:28.323
To avoid casualties from our side‎,

48:28.489 --> 48:30.867
I suggest that we use carpet bombing‎.

50:47.587 --> 50:48.546
Comrades‎,

50:48.963 --> 50:50.339
look at the comrade who died in front of you

50:50.506 --> 50:51.424
and tell me‎,

50:52.759 --> 50:53.926
what is this‎?

50:55.053 --> 50:56.137
This is a letter of challenge‎.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.681
The provocation to Chinese soldiers

50:59.390 --> 51:00.767
Six hours later‎,

51:01.434 --> 51:02.769
the enemies will possibly cross the border

51:02.935 --> 51:04.145
and escape from China‎.

51:05.021 --> 51:06.397
Now‎, I am giving you the order

51:06.564 --> 51:08.357
to take our lost honour back‎.

51:10.610 --> 51:11.903
If you cannot complete your mission

51:12.070 --> 51:13.279
within the time‎,

51:13.654 --> 51:14.781
I will call for air support

51:15.448 --> 51:18.201
and carpet bomb the whole area‎.

51:19.619 --> 51:21.496
The place we are going to protect

51:21.954 --> 51:23.498
is always desolate and uninhabited‎.

51:24.290 --> 51:26.042
If this battle had not happened‎,

51:26.334 --> 51:28.503
we might never come here in our life‎.

51:28.961 --> 51:30.797
There is no pretty views here‎,

51:30.963 --> 51:32.590
and there is no treasures here‎,

51:33.049 --> 51:34.884
but in our soldiers' eyes‎,

51:35.134 --> 51:36.803
here is the most beautiful place‎,

51:37.303 --> 51:40.181
because it is the border of
the People's Republic of China‎,

51:40.515 --> 51:42.683
It is the place that we must fight for

51:43.017 --> 51:44.519
with our lives and blood‎.

52:03.121 --> 52:03.830
Now‎,

52:04.122 --> 52:06.040
let's make a vow for the honour of our soldiers‎.

52:07.083 --> 52:08.668
Those who challenge China's resolve

52:08.876 --> 52:09.836
will have no safe place to hide

52:10.002 --> 52:11.462
Salute‎!

52:48.875 --> 52:50.209
Spread into three teams‎,

54:01.322 --> 54:02.490
Alpha‎, hold one

54:03.449 --> 54:05.076
Bravo‎, bound back‎.

55:27.700 --> 55:28.659
Stop‎!

55:34.874 --> 55:35.499
Mine field‎.

55:35.666 --> 55:36.542
Back off‎.

55:36.751 --> 55:37.668
Change route‎.

56:00.358 --> 56:01.776
You got eyes on the brass‎?

56:03.652 --> 56:04.528
Put him down‎,

56:04.695 --> 56:05.905
just wound him‎.

56:12.536 --> 56:13.579
They have snipers‎.

56:13.746 --> 56:14.747
Fire suppression‎.

56:25.383 --> 56:26.050
Lie down‎.

56:26.217 --> 56:27.426
One o'clock‎.

56:35.267 --> 56:36.685
The enemy is out of fire range‎.

56:36.852 --> 56:37.645
Sniper‎.

56:37.812 --> 56:39.105
Where is our sniper‎?

56:39.271 --> 56:40.439
Here‎.

56:49.156 --> 56:50.366
Come back‎.

56:54.829 --> 56:57.373
Don't come again‎.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.085
This is the order‎.

57:12.138 --> 57:15.808
Commander‎, no‎! Commander‎.

57:17.101 --> 57:18.727
Company commander‎. No‎.

57:20.229 --> 57:22.898
Company commander‎, no‎!

57:42.418 --> 57:44.003
What are you doing‎?

57:44.378 --> 57:46.297
Who told you to come over‎?

57:46.839 --> 57:49.175
Haven't you heard my order‎?

57:49.758 --> 57:51.177
Stop coming‎.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.387
Have you heard me‎?

58:09.737 --> 58:11.030
Brothers‎.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.616
I beg you‎.

58:15.576 --> 58:17.161
Do your brother a favour‎.

58:19.413 --> 58:20.831
Make it quick‎.

58:28.672 --> 58:30.049
Platoon Commander‎.

58:31.300 --> 58:33.010
Help your little brother‎.

58:34.136 --> 58:35.471
Please‎.

58:38.849 --> 58:40.601
Make it quick‎.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.270
Shoot me‎.

58:53.447 --> 58:54.657
Thank you‎.

59:07.670 --> 59:08.879
Thank you‎.

59:37.783 --> 59:39.201
Stop‎!

01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:20.492
Leng Feng‎,

01:00:21.035 --> 01:00:21.785
You‎.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.787
Confine me if you can come back alive‎.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:31.545
How about him‎?

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.921
Won't die‎.

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:39.678
Continue to outflank I will take care him‎.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.397
What is he doing‎?

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.108
A good sniper need 2‎.5 seconds at least‎.

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:54.652
Only 2‎.3 seconds for me‎.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:55.986
Are you sure you are going to do this‎?

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:57.029
Report‎!

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:58.656
Action request‎!

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:06.372
Action‎!

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:10.376
Change position‎. Move to high ground‎.

01:01:12.378 --> 01:01:13.087
Go‎!

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:28.686
Target‎, ten o'clock‎, moving fast‎.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:29.895
Take him‎!

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:32.398
Take him out‎! now‎.

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:35.234
Arrived‎.

01:01:42.408 --> 01:01:43.200
Arrived‎.

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:52.918
Arrived‎.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.840
Leng Feng‎,

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:02.302
Leng Feng‎,

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:04.346
Are you OK‎?

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:07.349
Fuck

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:08.600
Missed my head

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:10.728
Shot my clothes‎.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:53.562
Arrived‎.

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:05.991
Arrived‎.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.245
Arrived‎.

01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:31.683
Ar‎.

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.519
What do you look like when you are drunk‎?

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.438
come back alive first

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.283
Shit‎!

01:06:56.722 --> 01:06:57.389
Go‎!

01:06:58.682 --> 01:06:59.433
Go‎!

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:01.226
Move‎!

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:39.556
Shit Rubberneck‎!

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:40.599
Shit Rubberneck‎!

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:41.975
Are you really dead‎?

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:43.351
Wake up‎!

01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:44.770
Rubberneck‎!

01:07:52.778 --> 01:07:54.780
I will be dead if you keep shaking‎.

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:56.990
Blame your rubbish marksmanship‎.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.367
It hurts‎. It hurts‎.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:00.744
Don't you feel hurt‎?

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.496
I can hold‎.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:05.665
Police sent photos of Min Deng‎.

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:06.666
He was meeting with

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.044
the head of a bio‎-pharmaceutical company‎.

01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:10.170
Bio‎-pharmaceutical‎?

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.046
One month ago‎,

01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:13.131
one of our disease prevention and control centres

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:14.758
was broken by commercial spies‎.

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:15.926
They successfully stole

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:17.844
a huge number of blood samples of volunteers‎,

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:19.930
and genetic data of variant viruses‎.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:21.473
If these samples and data

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.640
finished up at this so called

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.850
international bio‎-pharmaceutical company‎,

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:27.270
They would make disease with Chinese genes

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:30.023
that can only infect Chinese people‎.

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:33.819
or even increase the malformation rate of new‎-borns

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.487
by over ten thousand times‎.

01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:37.447
Genetic weapon‎.

01:09:57.319 --> 01:09:58.195
This is from Tomcat‎.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.905
The border deployment map of China Military‎.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.907
He said the border has been completely blocked‎,

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:03.366
and let us think of a way out ourselves

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:04.910
to do what we really want to do‎.

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:34.481
This is the MD‎-82‎-B Antipersonnel Mine‎.

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:35.523
Burst direction 180‎,

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:36.775
explosion area 30 cubic metres‎,

01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:38.109
probability of kill 98%‎,

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.903
with 100 steel shots inside the mine‎.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.446
Successful manual disarming rate is very low‎.

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:42.614
The changing pressure

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:43.907
cannot exceed 0‎.5 kilograms

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:44.324
if‎.‎.‎.‎.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:45.700
Quiet‎!

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:51.957
Leng Feng‎,

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:54.000
Listen to me‎.

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.294
Be careful‎.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.797
You must be very careful‎.

01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:02.342
I'll wait for you back to buy me a drink‎.

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:47.095
Leng Feng‎, Leng Feng‎.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:57.939
Leng Feng‎.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:11:59.899
Answer me‎.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.110
Leng Feng‎, are you OK‎?

01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:04.279
Leng Feng‎, Leng Feng‎.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:07.824
Yeah‎.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.702
Yeah‎.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:15.457
That's hurt‎.

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:18.543
Long Xiaoyun‎,

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:21.087
do you have a boyfriend‎?

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:29.471
He is asking you if you have a boyfriend‎.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.237
No‎.

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.157
What‎?

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:51.117
What‎, what‎?

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:53.244
She said she doesn't have one‎.

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:08.760
Shit Rubberneck‎!

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.097
I would have long killed that big guy without you‎.

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:13.890
I'm Shi Rubberneck‎,

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.267
Not Shit Rubberneck‎.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:17.227
Ar‎.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:18.770
Comrade‎,

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.107
you have to find Leng Feng‎.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.192
Don't worry‎.

01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:27.237
I will find him‎.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:02.147
Freeze‎.

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:12.986
Are you kicking legs with me‎?

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:25.456
You know I'll go admit

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:28.710
you may not be the smartest soldier
I have ever seen‎, but

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:30.378
you are the bravest‎.

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:32.422
Can you son of a bitch speak Chinese‎?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:33.840
What‎?

01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:34.882
Fuck‎!

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:50.982
You call yourself the mercenary red zone‎.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.611
you are not but a bunch of boy scouts

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:55.945
Listen‎,

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:59.157
don't even think of going back
when you break into China‎.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.693
Look at you‎.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.905
You are willing to die for your country‎,

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.368
but I got news for you‎, bucko‎.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.328
Doesn't make a difference‎.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:51.542
Doesn't make a difference‎.

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:55.880
Wanna know what I fight for‎?

01:17:58.383 --> 01:17:59.384
Money‎.

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:10.520
You are fucking‎.‎.‎.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.617
You want to die for your country‎.

01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:11.330
Leng Feng‎,

01:19:16.544 --> 01:19:17.962
Hold on‎.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:27.365
Kill‎!

01:20:27.532 --> 01:20:31.202
Kill‎!

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.124
Kill‎!

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:45.049
Come‎.

01:20:47.552 --> 01:20:48.845
Now what

01:20:54.225 --> 01:20:55.560
What

01:22:55.513 --> 01:22:56.514
Take away‎.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:10.152
Every beautiful place has stories‎.

01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:13.531
Those who challenge China's resolve

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:16.784
will have no safe place to hide‎.

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.722
Leng Feng asked me to give you this‎.

01:23:41.142 --> 01:23:42.518
He met the same situation as you did‎.

01:23:43.394 --> 01:23:44.145
He went ahead

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:45.521
and saved his comrade‎.

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:51.068
He wants me to tell you

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:53.362
it is easy to get killed‎.

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:57.033
but living with

01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:58.784
the guilt and the responsibility is hard‎.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:25.269
Platoon Commander‎,

01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:27.313
I beg you‎.

01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:29.732
Do your brother a favour‎.

01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:32.943
Make it quick‎.

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:37.448
Thanks‎.

01:24:58.469 --> 01:24:59.720
Commander‎, hard work for you‎.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:02.098
Serve the people‎.

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:05.267
I have met your father‎.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:08.604
Happy‎?

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:15.986
I'll be more handsome when I get old‎.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:25.996
How did you clear the mine you were on‎?

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.333
I can't remember‎.

01:25:30.543 --> 01:25:33.462
How about you buy my some drink‎.

01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:36.173
Wait for your confinement‎.
