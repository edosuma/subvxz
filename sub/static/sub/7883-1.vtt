Miss Eyre. Godspeed.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.281
Goodbye, Miss Eyre.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.116
Safe journey.
Thank you.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.660
Bye, Miss Eyre.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.454

24:18.249 --> 24:19.791
How do you do,
my dear?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.502
Are you Mrs. Fairfax?
Indeed I am.

24:26.549 --> 24:29.050
What a tedious journey
you must have had.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.553
Your hands must
be frozen. Here.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.060
Goodness.
How young you are.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.354
I'm quite experienced,
I can assure you.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.899
Of course you are.
I'm sure we're very
lucky to have you.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.986
Leah, would you
ask Martha to bring
a little hot port

24:48.070 --> 24:49.445
and cut a sandwich or two?

24:49.738 --> 24:51.156
Draw nearer the fire.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.367
John is taking your trunk
up to your room.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.415
I've put you at the
back of the house,
I hope you don't mind.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.917
The rooms at the
front have much
finer furniture,

25:03.002 --> 25:06.254
but they're so gloomy
and solitary, I think.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.090
I'm glad you're come.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.011
To be sure, this is
a grand old house,

25:13.429 --> 25:17.056
but I must confess that
in winter one can feel
a little dreary and alone.

25:17.933 --> 25:22.437
Leah's a very nice girl,
and John and Martha
are good people, too,

25:23.898 --> 25:25.940
but they are servants.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.484
One cannot talk to them
on terms of equality.

JANE: Am I meeting
Miss Fairfax tonight?

25:34.116 --> 25:35.450
Who?

25:36.076 --> 25:37.702
Miss Fairfax,
my pupil?

25:38.412 --> 25:40.705
Oh, you mean Miss Varens,
Mr. Rochester's ward.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.707
She's to be your pupil.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.542
Who's Mr. Rochester?

25:45.336 --> 25:49.631
Why, the owner of Thornfield.
Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.926
I thought Thornfield Hall
belonged to you.

25:53.010 --> 25:56.346
Bless you, child,
what an idea. Me?

25:56.805 --> 25:58.223
I'm only the housekeeper.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.641
Forgive me.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.727
There is a distant
connection between
Mr. Rochester and me,

26:02.811 --> 26:06.231
his mother was a Fairfax,
but I'd never presume on it.

26:06.649 --> 26:09.150
Heavens. Me,
owner of Thornfield?

26:09.818 --> 26:12.320
We shall have a cheerful
house this winter.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.697
With Miss Varens
here and with you,

26:14.782 --> 26:17.075
we'll have quite
a merry time of it.

26:17.159 --> 26:21.037
I'm sure that last winter,
and what a severe one it was,
if it didn't rain it snowed,

26:21.121 --> 26:23.081
if it didn't snow it blew.

26:23.165 --> 26:27.752
I declare, not one soul
came to the house from
November to February.

26:28.337 --> 26:32.090
When spring finally came,
I thought it a great relief
I hadn't gone distracted.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.508

26:36.053 --> 26:39.514

MRS. FAIRFAX:
We must open the
window in the study today

27:34.403 --> 27:35.653
to let in some air.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.409
I've never seen such
an ancient old house.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.412
How beautifully
you've preserved it.

27:44.538 --> 27:47.206
Well, Mr. Rochester's visits
are always unexpected.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.168
He doesn't like
to arrive and find
everything all swathed up,

27:50.252 --> 27:52.754
so I keep it in
constant readiness.

27:53.255 --> 27:56.549
Now, come and
meet Miss Varens.

she's French?

28:11.940 --> 28:13.858
Will you ask her
about her parents?

neglected to tell me
anything about her.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.922
I've been waiting
to pour our tea.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.132
I'm not in need of tea,
thank you.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.472
It's a quiet life,
isn't it?

31:33.600 --> 31:38.980

a still doom for
a young woman.

I wish a woman could
have action in her life,
like a man.

It agitates me to pain
that the skyline over

for a power of vision

I've never
spoken with men.

come from?

to post a letter.

go and light the fire in

35:08.523 --> 35:09.732
And tell Martha
to prepare for tea.

Go and change your frock.
He wishes to meet you.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.450
Leah, take her cloak.
I have to change?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.869
I always dress for
the evening when
Mr. Rochester's here.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.621
But all my dresses
are the same.

one that's better.

in Hay Lane, and
his ankle is sprained.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.007

this half hour.

and I find you've taken
great pains with her.

She's not bright,
she has no talents,

36:27.602 --> 36:29.645

she's improved.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.690
Thank you, Mr. Rochester.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.525
You've been resident
here three months?

36:34.609 --> 36:35.985
Yes, sir.

36:36.069 --> 36:38.028
And from whence
do you hail?

36:38.947 --> 36:40.865
What's your tale of woe?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.409
Pardon?

36:43.618 --> 36:46.996
All governesses
have a tale of woe.
What's yours?

36:47.914 --> 36:50.708
I was brought up by my aunt,
Mrs. Reed of Gateshead,

36:50.792 --> 36:52.585
in a house even
finer than this.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.045
I then attended
Lowood School,
where I received

36:55.130 --> 36:57.256
as good an education
as I could hope for.

36:57.924 --> 37:00.009
I have no tale
of woe, sir.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.469
Dead.

Do you remember them?
No.

And why are you
not with Mrs. Reed
of Gateshead now?

37:11.104 --> 37:12.897
She cast me off, sir.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.107
Why?

37:15.317 --> 37:17.651
Because I was burdensome
and she disliked me.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.779
No tale of woe?

for sending us Miss Eyre.

Don't trouble yourself to
give her a character.
I'll judge for myself.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.962

for this sprain.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.339
Sir?

37:39.633 --> 37:41.258
You bewitched my horse.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.218
I did not.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.512
Were you waiting
for your people
on that lane?

37:46.014 --> 37:47.264
I have no people, sir.

37:47.390 --> 37:51.268
I mean for the imps
and elves and little
green men.

37:52.854 --> 37:54.605

they are all gone.

nor savage enough for them.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.034

Are they yours?

get your copies?

you painted these?
Yes.

To paint is one of
the keenest pleasures
I have ever known.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.854
Then your pleasures
have been few.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.691

with them?

42:23.458 --> 42:24.833
I'm not fond
of children.

42:25.293 --> 42:28.378
Nor do I particularly enjoy
simple-minded old ladies.

42:29.422 --> 42:31.632
But you might suit me,
if you would.

42:32.592 --> 42:33.592
How, sir?

42:34.385 --> 42:37.262
By distracting me
from the mire of
my thoughts.

42:38.306 --> 42:40.307
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

42:43.061 --> 42:45.020
That is how Maman
used to say.

42:45.647 --> 42:46.855
Precisely.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.733
And that's
how she charmed
my English gold

42:49.817 --> 42:51.318
out of my English pocket.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.821
MRS. FAIRFAX:
Let's go and try it on,
shall we?

42:56.491 --> 42:58.367
(SIGHING)

43:07.543 --> 43:09.586
Your gaze is very
direct, Miss Eyre.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.340
Do you think me handsome?

43:14.133 --> 43:15.342
No, sir.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.178
What fault do
you find with me?

43:18.263 --> 43:19.930
I have all my limbs
and features.

43:20.682 --> 43:22.266
I beg your pardon, sir.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.936
I ought to have replied
that beauty is of
little consequence.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.611
You're blushing, Miss Eyre.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.782
And though
you're not pretty any more
than I am handsome,

43:38.866 --> 43:40.617
I must say it becomes you.

43:46.207 --> 43:49.334
And now I see
you're fascinated by
the flowers on the rug.

43:52.255 --> 43:53.922
Come, speak to me.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.800
Fact is, Miss Eyre,
I'd like to draw you out.

43:57.719 --> 44:00.512
You have rather
the look of another
world about you.

44:04.934 --> 44:07.602
I don't wish to treat
you as inferior.

44:08.521 --> 44:10.355
Yet you'd command
me to speak?

44:11.065 --> 44:12.899
Are you very hurt by
my tone of command?

44:13.401 --> 44:14.985
There are few masters
who'd trouble to enquire

44:15.069 --> 44:16.611
whether their paid
subordinates

44:16.696 --> 44:18.155
were hurt by their commands.

44:18.239 --> 44:21.616
Paid subordinate?
I'd forgotten the salary.

44:23.536 --> 44:24.786
Well, on that
mercenary ground,

44:24.871 --> 44:26.872
will you consent
to speak as my equal

44:26.956 --> 44:29.291
without thinking that
the request arises
from insolence?

44:30.168 --> 44:32.586
I'd never mistake
informality for
insolence, sir.

44:33.087 --> 44:37.132
One, I rather like.
The other, nothing freeborn
should ever submit to.

44:37.425 --> 44:38.425
Humbug.

44:39.886 --> 44:40.886
Even for a salary.

44:40.970 --> 44:44.014
Most free-born things
would submit to
anything for a salary.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.186
But I mentally shake
hands with you
for your answer.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.106
Not three in 3,000
schoolgirl governesses

44:53.191 --> 44:55.525
would have answered me
as you've just done.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.986
Then you've not
spent much time in
our company, sir.

44:58.446 --> 45:01.656
I'm the same plain kind
of bird as all the rest,

45:01.741 --> 45:03.325
with my common tale of woe.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.538
I envy you.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.125
How?

45:12.502 --> 45:14.878
Your openness,
your unpolluted mind.

45:16.631 --> 45:19.841
When I was your age,
fate dealt me a blow.

45:21.803 --> 45:23.553
And since happiness
is denied me,

45:23.638 --> 45:25.764
I've a right to get
pleasure in its stead.

45:26.307 --> 45:28.141
And I will get it,
cost what it may.

45:29.769 --> 45:32.187
Then you'll degenerate
still more.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.022
But, Miss Eyre,

45:36.943 --> 45:40.487
if the pleasure
I was seeking was
sweet and fresh,

45:43.366 --> 45:47.577
if it was an inspiration,
if it wore the robes of
an angel of light,

45:49.330 --> 45:50.664
what then?

45:54.627 --> 45:57.045
To speak truth, sir,
I don't understand you at all.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.842
I fear the conversation
has got out of my depth.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.928
You're afraid of me.

46:05.388 --> 46:09.224
I'm not afraid.
I've simply no wish
to talk nonsense.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.686
(LAUGHS)

46:14.230 --> 46:15.480
(SIGHS)

46:18.484 --> 46:19.818
Do you never laugh,
Miss Eyre?

46:22.738 --> 46:24.072
Only rarely, perhaps.

46:25.825 --> 46:27.075
But you're not
naturally austere,

46:27.160 --> 46:28.869
any more than
I'm naturally vicious.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.957
I can see in you
the glance of a
curious sort of bird

46:34.041 --> 46:35.959
through the close-set
bars of a cage,

46:36.043 --> 46:38.670
a vivid, restless captive.

46:41.883 --> 46:47.095
Were it but free,
it would soar, cloud-high.

from my sleep.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.338
What noise?

49:26.756 --> 49:28.381
There was someone
at my door.

49:33.095 --> 49:34.387

But...
I'll account for
this state of affairs.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.653
Say nothing.

50:33.614 --> 50:34.864
Yes, sir.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.119
Is that how you
would leave me?

50:41.080 --> 50:43.164
Jane, fire is
a horrible death.

50:43.249 --> 50:44.624
You've saved my life.

50:46.127 --> 50:48.545
Don't walk past me
as if we were strangers.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.214
But what am I to do then?

51:07.648 --> 51:09.441
I've a pleasure in
owing you my life.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.405
There is no debt.

51:18.701 --> 51:20.910
I knew you would do me
good in some way.

51:22.538 --> 51:24.664
I saw it in your eyes
when I first beheld you.

51:26.667 --> 51:30.336
Their expression did
not strike my very inmost
being so for nothing.

sympathies. You...

Good night then, sir.

not sent for us today?

52:42.076 --> 52:43.827
Why, he's gone away.

52:43.911 --> 52:46.329
Were you not aware?
He left after breakfast.

52:48.415 --> 52:52.252
He's gone to the Leas.
It's Mr. Eshton's place.

I believe Blanche
Ingram is there.

52:55.381 --> 52:57.090
She's a great
favorite of his.

ago when Mr. Rochester
gave a party here.

She's a most
elegant girl.

They sang a duet together.
They made a lovely harmony.

53:10.604 --> 53:12.522
I was quite surprised
he didn't make a proposal,

53:12.606 --> 53:13.857
but she has no fortune.

53:13.941 --> 53:17.151
In every other way
they'd make
a splendid match.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.404
Perhaps it's his
intention now.

53:22.992 --> 53:24.993
He's far more likely to
have gone off to Europe.

53:25.119 --> 53:27.120
He often goes
without so much
as a fare-you-well,

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.909
I shall be ready
when your order
to march comes.

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:06.830
Must I really lose
a faithful paid subordinate
such as yourself?

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.040
You must.

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:11.710
We've been good friends,
haven't we?

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:14.838
Yes, sir.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:22.220
I've a strange feeling
with regard to you,

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:26.349
as if I had a string
somewhere under my left ribs,

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:29.394
tightly knotted to
a similar string in you.

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:31.187
And if you were to leave,

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:34.232
I'm afraid that
cord of communion
would snap.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:40.155
And I've a notion
that I'd take to
bleeding inwardly.

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.909
As for you,
you'd forget me.

01:17:48.039 --> 01:17:49.122
How?

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:52.917
I have lived
a full life here.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.294
I have not been
trampled on.

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:55.628
I have not
been petrified.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:59.424
I have not been
excluded from every
glimpse of what is bright.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:03.053
I have known you,
Mr. Rochester,

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:06.431
and it strikes me
with anguish to be
torn from you.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.641
Then why must you leave?

01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:09.768
Because of your wife!

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:10.935
I have no wife.

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:12.562
But you are
to be married.

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.314
Jane, you must stay.

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:18.276
And become
nothing to you?

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:22.155
Am I a machine
without feelings?

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:26.284
Do you think that
because I am poor,
obscure, plain and little

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:29.371
that I am soulless
and heartless?

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.748
I have as much soul as you
and full as much heart.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.250
And if God had blessed me
with beauty and wealth,

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:36.086
I could make it as hard
for you to leave me

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:38.755
as it is for I
to leave you.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:42.258
I'm not speaking to you
through mortal flesh.

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:45.136
It is my spirit that
addresses your spirit,

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.390
as if we'd passed
through the grave and stood
at God's feet, equal,

01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:50.016
as we are.
As we are.

01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:56.106
I am a free human being
with an independent will,

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.982
which I now exert
to leave you.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:00.110
Then let your will
decide your destiny.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:03.655
I offer you my hand,
my heart.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.490
Jane,

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.701
I ask you to pass
through life at my side.

01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:11.538
You are my equal
and my likeness.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.873
Will you marry me?

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.253
Are you mocking me?

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:20.213
Do you doubt me?

01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:22.048
Entirely!

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.258
Your bride is Miss Ingram.

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:24.426
Miss Ingram?

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:27.303
She is the machine
without feelings.

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:30.140
It's you. You rare,
unearthly thing.

01:19:30.224 --> 01:19:32.892
Poor and obscure
as you are,

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:34.936
please accept me
as your husband.

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.897
I must have you for my own.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.276
You wish me
to be your wife?

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.278
I swear it.

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:44.904
You love me?

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:46.531
I do.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:53.246
Then, sir,
I will marry you.

Good night, my love.

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:57.101
Good night.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.240
Am I a monster?

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:13.284
Is it so impossible
that Mr. Rochester
should love me?

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:14.786
No.

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:18.623
I've long noticed
you were a sort
of pet of his.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:22.877
But you're so young
and you're so little
acquainted with men.

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:28.341
I don't want to
grieve you, child,

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:30.969
but let me just put
you on your guard.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:33.221
Gentlemen in his position...

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:34.722
Well, let's just say,

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:39.227
they're not accustomed
to marry their governesses.

01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:44.649
Until you are wed,
distrust yourself
as well as him.

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:46.442
Please,

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:49.320
keep him at a distance.

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:58.621
Come.

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:17.348
What is it?

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:23.521
Jane Eyre with
nothing to say?

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.898
Everything seems unreal.

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.985
I am real enough.

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:33.865

phantom-like of all.

joined together lawfully,

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.873
you do now confess it.

We have no furniture,
as she can make a weapon

upon the roof each day,

I hardly spoke with her
before the wedding.

01:31:56.219 --> 01:31:58.596
I lived with her
for four years.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.266

and baited like beasts.

that at least.

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:44.808
I would.

01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:48.062
You'd rather drive
me to madness

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:50.773
than break some
mere human law?

01:32:53.944 --> 01:32:55.361
I must respect myself.

in my hands.

with this cage,

01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:32.064
I cannot get at you.

that I want.

of your own free will?

Not at all.

Is the solitude
an oppression?

01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:26.780
I hardly have time
to notice it.

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:28.240
Thank you, girls.

01:36:28.324 --> 01:36:29.575
BOTH: Yes, ma'am.

01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:35.164
Then perhaps
you are dwelling
on things past.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:39.918
When I came to your door,
I had nothing.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:43.922
Now I have a home and work,
free and honest.

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:47.301
I thank God
for the generosity
of my friends.

01:36:49.762 --> 01:36:53.056
What you had left
before I met you,
I don't know.

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:55.559
But I counsel you
to resist firmly

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:57.978
every temptation
to look back.

01:36:58.855 --> 01:37:00.814
That's what I intend to do.

01:37:00.899 --> 01:37:04.401
A year ago, I was myself
intensely miserable.

01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:06.904
I scorned this weakness,

01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:09.990
fought hard against it
and won.

01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:19.041
I wonder if we
do not share
the same alloy.

01:37:19.918 --> 01:37:22.044
You are ambitious,
I think.

01:37:22.754 --> 01:37:25.422
And this little school
will not hold you for long.

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:33.847
Is this yours?

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:35.140
Yes.

01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:39.269
What's the matter?

01:37:39.979 --> 01:37:40.979
Nothing.

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:45.025
Good night.

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.340
(BANGING ON DOOR)

01:38:27.652 --> 01:38:29.528
Jane.

01:38:44.168 --> 01:38:46.211
Miss Eyre.

01:38:52.343 --> 01:38:55.012
What brings you
from your hearth
on a night like this?

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:56.346
There is no bad
news, I hope.

01:38:56.472 --> 01:39:00.058
How easily alarmed
you are, Miss Eyre.

01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:03.312
Please, won't
you sit down?

01:39:03.396 --> 01:39:05.355
Thank you, Miss Eyre.

01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:15.490
I saw an advertisement
in The Times from
a solicitor named Briggs

01:39:15.617 --> 01:39:17.618
inquiring of a Jane Eyre.

01:39:18.703 --> 01:39:20.203
I knew a Jane Elliott.

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:24.875
This paper
resolved my suspicion
into certainty.

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.296
And so, I wrote to him.

01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:32.090
He told the story of
a young governess.

01:39:33.426 --> 01:39:35.636
And her employer,
a Mr. Fairfax Rochester...

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.554
Mr. Rivers.

01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:42.684
I can guess your feelings,
but please hear me.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:49.066
As you know so much,
perhaps you'll tell
me how he is?

01:39:49.233 --> 01:39:51.151
Who?
Mr. Rochester.

01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:53.362
I'm ignorant of
all concerning him.

01:39:55.073 --> 01:39:56.907
But he has
been seeking me?

01:39:57.075 --> 01:39:59.910
No, he hasn't.

01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:03.163
Mr. Briggs has.

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:05.707
And what does
he want with me?

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:09.044
Merely to tell you
that your uncle,

01:40:09.128 --> 01:40:12.339
Mr. John Eyre of
Madeira, is dead,

01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:15.175
that he has left you
all his property

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:16.718
and that you
are now rich.

01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.263
What?

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:21.932
You are rich,

01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:24.267
quite an heiress.

01:40:26.896 --> 01:40:28.313
Will you ask how
much you are worth?

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.358
How much am I worth?

01:40:31.984 --> 01:40:33.902
Twenty thousand pounds.

01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:37.030
(LAUGHING)

01:40:37.115 --> 01:40:38.573
If you had committed
a murder

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:41.243
and I'd found you out,
you could scarcely
look more aghast.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.870
There must be
some mistake.

01:40:43.955 --> 01:40:45.372
Not at all.

01:40:48.126 --> 01:40:50.877
You look desperately
miserable about it,
I must say.

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:54.464
Please,

01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:58.552
sit down.
I've shocked you.

01:41:20.158 --> 01:41:22.159
Mr. St. John.

01:41:22.326 --> 01:41:24.161
The debt I owe to you
and your sisters...

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:25.662
Is nothing.

01:41:27.457 --> 01:41:29.124
You saved my life.

01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:34.463
Please write to them.

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:36.548
This money frees us.

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:37.883
They will have 5,000 each,

01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:39.301
and so will you,
if you'll take it.

01:41:39.385 --> 01:41:40.427
Certainly not.

01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:41.762
And if you would accept
me as a sister,

01:41:41.846 --> 01:41:42.971
perhaps we could
live together,

01:41:43.055 --> 01:41:44.097
at Moor House.

01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:45.932
I told you the
news too quickly.

01:41:46.768 --> 01:41:48.351
You're confused.

01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:50.187
My only relative is dead.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.731
You have family.

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:54.649
You cannot know
what isolation means.

01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:56.860
And you cannot know
what it means
to be wealthy.

01:41:56.986 --> 01:41:59.404
I have been alone always.

01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:01.490
I've never had
a brother or sisters.

01:42:01.574 --> 01:42:02.741
Please, let me be yours.

01:42:09.749 --> 01:42:11.958
Are you reluctant
to have me?

01:42:12.168 --> 01:42:13.335
No, Miss Eyre.

01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:16.171
On the contrary.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.089
I shall write
to my sisters,
as you request.

01:42:19.592 --> 01:42:20.926
Brother.

01:42:28.267 --> 01:42:31.269
ST. JOHN:
We are bid to work
while it is day.

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:35.482
For night cometh,
when no man shall work.

01:42:37.068 --> 01:42:39.319
Help us to choose
the harder path,

01:42:40.404 --> 01:42:42.239
for as our master
is long-suffering,

01:42:43.533 --> 01:42:45.534
so must we be.

01:42:47.912 --> 01:42:48.995
Amen.

01:42:49.413 --> 01:42:50.872
Amen.
Amen.

01:42:55.002 --> 01:43:00.090
Good night.
Good night.

01:43:01.676 --> 01:43:03.093
Good night.

01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.263
Is Jane not
our sister, too?

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:18.191
Good night.

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:29.202
ST. JOHN:

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:38.336
I go to India
in six weeks.

01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:42.841
I can see what
your gifts are

01:43:42.967 --> 01:43:44.134
and why they were given.

01:43:45.344 --> 01:43:49.055
God intended you
for a missionary's wife.

01:43:51.767 --> 01:43:53.518
I want to claim you.

01:43:55.104 --> 01:43:56.605
I'm not fit for it.

01:43:58.608 --> 01:44:00.609
I trust you
unreservedly.

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:03.236
And know this,

01:44:04.614 --> 01:44:05.614
in you,

01:44:06.699 --> 01:44:09.284
I recognize
a fellow soul.

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:20.188
I'll go with you
to India.

01:45:21.315 --> 01:45:22.357
Jane.

01:45:22.441 --> 01:45:24.025
I'll go if
I may go free.

01:45:25.236 --> 01:45:26.319
Free?

01:45:28.656 --> 01:45:31.449
How can I take out
to India a girl of 19
unless she is my wife?

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:34.327
I love you as a brother.
As a husband, no.

01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:37.539
My heart is mute.

01:45:38.582 --> 01:45:40.583
Then I must speak for it.

01:45:41.293 --> 01:45:43.253
You've said you'll come.

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:45.005
We shall marry.

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:47.632
And undoubtedly
enough of love
would follow.

01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:52.554
Enough of love?

01:45:54.098 --> 01:45:55.098
Yes, quite enough.

01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:57.100
Of love?

01:45:57.601 --> 01:45:59.936
Yes. In all its forms.

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:02.856
Forgive me, but
the very name of love

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.817
is an apple of discord
between us.

01:46:05.943 --> 01:46:08.862
My dear brother,
abandon your
scheme of marriage.

01:46:08.946 --> 01:46:10.780
Why this refusal?

01:46:11.449 --> 01:46:12.949
It makes no sense.

01:46:13.034 --> 01:46:15.035
I earnestly wish
to be your friend.

01:46:15.119 --> 01:46:17.412
You can't give
half a sacrifice.

01:46:19.123 --> 01:46:20.290
You must give all.

01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:22.542
To marry you
would kill me!

01:46:22.668 --> 01:46:27.839
Kill you?

01:46:29.258 --> 01:46:31.843
Those words are
unfeminine and untrue.

01:46:35.639 --> 01:46:37.807
I know where your heart turns
and to what it still clings.

01:46:41.687 --> 01:46:42.896
Say his name.

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:47.817
Say it. Say it!

01:46:48.986 --> 01:46:50.904
ROCHESTER: Jane.

01:46:50.988 --> 01:46:53.740
Why have you not
yet crushed this
lawless passion?

01:46:56.952 --> 01:46:57.994
Jane!

01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:00.914
It offends me and
it offends God!

01:47:01.332 --> 01:47:02.707
What is it?

01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:05.168
Where are you?

01:47:07.296 --> 01:47:08.296
Wait for me.

01:47:08.714 --> 01:47:10.715
Why do you speak to the air?

01:47:13.177 --> 01:47:14.177
Jane.

01:47:14.553 --> 01:47:15.553
ROCHESTER: Jane.

01:47:17.681 --> 01:47:19.516
I am coming!
Jane!

01:47:55.719 --> 01:47:57.428
Wait, please, Miss.

01:49:42.534 --> 01:49:44.661
I thought
gypsies were come.

01:49:45.621 --> 01:49:48.623
And then I saw you,
and I thought,
it cannot be,

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:50.333
you are a ghost.

01:49:53.295 --> 01:49:55.421
No one knows
how it started.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.885
I expect that Mrs. Poole
took too much of
the gin and water,

01:50:01.011 --> 01:50:02.845
and as she slept,
the lady,

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:05.598
Mrs. Rochester,
unhooked the keys.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.351
She did what she failed
to do a year ago,

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.812
set the whole place
to fire.

01:50:13.565 --> 01:50:15.608
We would have
all perished
in the smoke,

01:50:15.693 --> 01:50:19.153
but Mr. Rochester
would not rest till
we were all safe.

01:50:20.072 --> 01:50:22.282
Then he went
in for her.

01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:25.285
The flames were
tearing up so high

01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:27.745
it brought men running
from the village.

01:50:28.414 --> 01:50:30.665
I saw her standing
on the roof.

01:50:30.749 --> 01:50:31.791
The very edge.

01:50:32.418 --> 01:50:34.961
I heard Mr. Rochester
beg her to come down.

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.256
But she jumped.

01:50:40.342 --> 01:50:41.551
Mr. Rochester remained,

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:45.138
as if he would not move
until the fire consumed him.

01:50:47.391 --> 01:50:48.850
I didn't know.

01:50:50.227 --> 01:50:52.687
I didn't know
it was his wife,
I promise you.

01:50:54.231 --> 01:50:56.149
Why did you
run away, child?

01:50:57.151 --> 01:50:59.110
I would have helped you.

01:50:59.737 --> 01:51:01.946
I had some money saved.

01:51:02.114 --> 01:51:03.698
You could have come to me.

01:51:08.245 --> 01:51:09.746

I conscientiously
believe so.

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:02.084
