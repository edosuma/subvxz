AIRSHIP "MOBY DICK" - CARGO HOLD

00:26.276 --> 00:29.947
If you have something to say,
why don't you come out and say it?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.406
No, I don't.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.787
I was just wondering
if you could actually go through with it.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.209
Would you care to find out right now?

00:43.919 --> 00:44.753
Scary!

01:19.204 --> 01:24.126
Where are your wings?
Are they tucked away inside your body?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.587
I was told to touch Canopus.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.340
So, I made contact with you.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.928
Touch what? Told by who?

01:35.595 --> 01:40.892
Canopus. That's what we call old people
who show us the way.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.938
CANOPUS = "STAR OF OLD AGE"

01:45.022 --> 01:49.192
What a coincidence. I've been looking
for a murderous little punk myself.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.281
Where is Yuna?

01:55.574 --> 01:56.408
Yuna?

02:02.831 --> 02:06.084
Is Yuna the "IIII" you've spent your life
apart from...

02:09.838 --> 02:11.089
my good number 13?

02:15.093 --> 02:18.513
So, has she noticed the marks
you've been leaving for her?

02:20.265 --> 02:23.602
From the looks of it,
it seems like she hasn't answered yet.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.396
And after all your effort
with those murders...

02:27.648 --> 02:30.108
Your girlfriend is pretty cold.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.947
The only people I kill
are those who deserve to die.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.243
How upstanding of you.

02:41.912 --> 02:42.954
Here. Want one?

02:47.459 --> 02:50.420
I guess you never had any grownups around

02:51.046 --> 02:53.423
to tell you not to be so full of yourself.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.719
What do you know?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.224
Nothing, I guess.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.353
But I do know
what that mark of yours means.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.023
That's not a "B,"

03:10.649 --> 03:12.692
that's a 13 in Arabic numerals

03:13.026 --> 03:15.987
and the Roman numeral four
only used on clocks, right?

03:17.406 --> 03:19.574
Two numbers overlapping.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.121
The 13 is you, and she is the IIII, right?

03:26.623 --> 03:30.127
It's probably a code
only the two of you would recognize,

03:30.961 --> 03:34.589
and Killer B has kept killing murderers
as a way to spread it.

03:36.133 --> 03:41.888
It was all to let this girl you can't find
know that you're alive.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.519
Every time you killed someone,
it was like you were shouting.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.188
"I'm right here!"

03:52.441 --> 03:53.567
Where is Yuna?

03:55.068 --> 04:01.742
Goodness, kids these days are so greedy,
with no concept of give and take.

04:02.951 --> 04:07.914
Anyway, you must've brought me here
because you had something to ask.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.877
Well, I have questions for you, too.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.714
I'm not interested in playing word games
with you.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.673
If you know, tell me where Yuna--

04:17.757 --> 04:18.759
Tomorrow at 10:00.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.470
You know where Heian-ji is?

04:22.471 --> 04:25.432
It's an Oriental-style Buddhist temple.
In Ward Eight.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.351
I'll tell you everything then.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.271
Hey! Tell me here!

04:32.105 --> 04:34.232
There's something I need to show you.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.861
I'll bring it tomorrow. Don't be late.

04:43.784 --> 04:48.830
ROYAL POLICE, STORAGE WAREHOUSE

04:53.585 --> 04:54.753
What is this place?

04:55.378 --> 04:56.421
Archives Division.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.097
Oops.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.607
-There's so much here.
-Where is it, where is it?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.317
Keith worked here?

05:18.902 --> 05:21.321
Yeah. For eight years.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.282
All by himself.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.872
What was the reason?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.333
Why was he sent here?

05:34.292 --> 05:39.256
During the trial, he abducted the murderer
Dead Kyle from the hospital he was in

05:39.339 --> 05:41.383
and tortured him without authorization.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.051
He did what?

05:56.940 --> 05:57.774
How did it go?

05:58.567 --> 06:01.403
They've begun the paperwork
for an arrest warrant.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.905
We'll be sent out after Keith, too.

06:07.659 --> 06:08.493
Your nail.

06:13.873 --> 06:14.833
Where is Lily?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.167
In the building.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.596
It's a shame about Jean.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.265
Yes.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.767
You're here about Keith Flick, right?

06:33.435 --> 06:34.477
Is he a suspect?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.106
For the time being.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.941
Then, you're here for me?

06:40.400 --> 06:45.405
Yes. I heard from Boris
about how you and Keith are old friends.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.325
I've known him since boarding school.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.536
We can't shake each other.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.498
Doctor, do you also think Keith did this?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.167
Do you?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.377
I don't think he did it.

06:59.628 --> 07:00.462
I see.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.674
Um, please tell me everything
you can about--

07:04.758 --> 07:09.971
The Keith Flick I know
is an exceedingly dull man.

07:11.056 --> 07:16.019
Since he can predict what lies ahead,
he can't really act in the moment.

07:17.187 --> 07:21.232
Um, so what you're saying is,
this incident doesn't seem premeditated.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.945
Therefore, Keith couldn't have done it.
Is that what you meant?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.864
I don't know the particulars,

07:28.239 --> 07:32.494
but if he's under suspicion,
he probably didn't do it.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.538
He couldn't do anything so careless.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.625
You don't mean "wouldn't"?

07:39.501 --> 07:41.294
No, I mean couldn't.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.714
Interesting.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.969
Just like always.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.428
Yes?

07:51.096 --> 07:55.266
For as long as I've known him,
good hearts have always been drawn to him.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.396
In spite of his being so unpleasant.
It's the strangest thing.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.357
You're one such person, I see.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.527
U-Um...

08:06.111 --> 08:08.989
That will do for now.
Thank you for your time!

08:11.533 --> 08:12.367
You know...

08:12.867 --> 08:14.786
maybe you really do resemble her.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.162
Excuse me?

08:37.433 --> 08:38.268
Hey!

08:39.227 --> 08:42.605
So carefree,
even though you're a wanted criminal.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.900
Being on the run leaves you
with a lot of down time.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.652
Did you bring it?

08:47.736 --> 08:50.613
Can't you see? It's on my back.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.116
Sorry. Thanks as always.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.454
Did Jean really kill himself?

08:57.537 --> 08:58.913
CONNECTED INCIDENTS

08:58.997 --> 09:01.207
-His memories?
-They'd been altered.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.625
Boy, this runs deep.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.169
AN ADAPTATION OF A MYSTERY

09:04.252 --> 09:08.590
Don't do anything crazy.
I won't be able to help you out forever.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.926
Eric already suspects
that I'm up to something.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.597
Don't worry about it. It'll probably end.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.098
And soon.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.311
Probably, anyway.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.147
I'M BEING FORCED TO PLAY ALONG WITH IT

09:25.732 --> 09:31.237
BUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS?

09:45.376 --> 09:49.005
I'll capture Lohengrin, trust me.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.648
Is there a problem?

10:07.273 --> 10:10.902
You know there is.
We didn't anticipate any of this.

10:11.945 --> 10:16.157
That's precisely why.
We didn't expect Lohengrin's abilities.

10:16.699 --> 10:20.411
So, we'll counter the unexpected
with the unexpected.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.247
What if someone dies?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.416
Just sit back and watch.

10:39.013 --> 10:43.560
WARD EIGHT, HEIAN-JI

11:12.005 --> 11:12.839
You came.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.133
Your name.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.847
You have a name, don't you?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.227
Tell me what it is.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.272
Koku.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.900
-I'm Keith.
-I know.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.484
Of course you do.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.740
Where do I start?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.700
-Yuna's--
-Relax.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.078
If you're alive, so is she.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.040
You better not be guessing.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.547
If I said "Jaula Blanca Institute,"
would you be more likely to believe me?

11:58.801 --> 12:01.179
It all began at the Jetblack.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.683
At the end of the 16th Century,

12:05.808 --> 12:10.480
13 fossilized skeletons were discovered
in the ruins at the top of the mountain.

12:11.856 --> 12:15.902
The scientists of the day classified
the bizarre winged skeletons

12:16.110 --> 12:17.820
as the progenitors of humanity

12:17.904 --> 12:21.449
and were fossils of gods
that flourished in the ancient past.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.620
So began the project
to restore these gods.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.626
The king and government realized they
could exploit the project politically.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.005
So,
to refill the country's depleted coffers,

12:36.714 --> 12:39.759
they solicited donations under the pretext
of resurrecting these gods

12:40.343 --> 12:42.762
and built a huge research facility.

12:44.222 --> 12:48.559
Its name was the Jaula Blanca
Royal Scientific Institute.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.065
Top scientists
and the cutting-edge technology of the day

12:54.607 --> 12:57.944
were brought there
in the name of resurrecting the gods.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.531
However...

13:01.823 --> 13:06.244
there were only corrupted researchers
who had grown drunk on the huge donations

13:06.327 --> 13:08.037
and days spent on trivialities.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.792
Without a particular plan,
they began an inbreeding program

13:12.917 --> 13:17.088
which produced malformed, insane offspring
they called the Promising Ones,

13:17.171 --> 13:18.464
which they disposed of.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.802
That so-called research was repeated
again and again for several centuries.

13:24.929 --> 13:29.225
When rumors began circulating that this
unsuccessful research would be terminated,

13:30.518 --> 13:34.188
one of the researchers went
before the king and made a proposal.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.735
"I will create an organization that
will intentionally manipulate the balance

13:38.818 --> 13:41.779
of fear and tranquility
inside and outside the kingdom.

13:42.447 --> 13:47.869
I will develop the human assets required
to carry out the project at Jaula Blanca."

13:49.537 --> 13:53.916
And so, the Promising Ones,
who had been derided as failures,

13:54.751 --> 13:58.546
were sent to the royal government
to be special intelligence agents

13:58.629 --> 14:01.049
that would create chaos and order.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.802
Their work would go on
to have a profound effect.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.890
They're now known... as Market Maker.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.519
Because of this, the institute survives

14:13.603 --> 14:17.857
as a facility that develops weapons
of carnage for their government patrons.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.569
Ironically, though,

14:21.652 --> 14:25.490
it was at this point that their research
into the gods leapt forward.

14:26.616 --> 14:30.161
Two lives were born
that showed them the way to success.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.625
But at that point, something happened.

14:43.007 --> 14:43.841
<i>Yuna?</i>

14:45.510 --> 14:46.344
<i>Yuna?</i>

14:48.137 --> 14:49.847
<i>Yuna! Yuna!</i>

14:50.515 --> 14:51.349
<i>Yuna!</i>

14:52.225 --> 14:53.059
<i>Yuna!</i>

14:53.601 --> 14:55.686
<i>Yuna! Yuna!</i>

14:56.396 --> 14:59.732
<i>Yuna!</i>

15:05.279 --> 15:09.158
All I remember is gunfire
and a burnt smell.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.455
How do you know about me?

15:16.707 --> 15:20.503
It's written "Kurohane" (Black Wings),
but it's read "Koku," huh?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.506
That's just like him.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.844
Have you heard of the Jetblack Epitaph?

15:28.469 --> 15:30.221
It's at the top of Mt. Cremona.

15:31.722 --> 15:36.686
With advances in genetic research
and the deciphering of that inscription,

15:36.769 --> 15:39.397
their research made
a quantum leap forward.

15:40.273 --> 15:45.027
It contained a record of the abilities
and form of the gods' bones.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.908
It was the arrival from Japan
of three cellular biologists

15:50.992 --> 15:54.537
that brought about the birth of you
and your guardians.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.873
One of those three...

15:57.665 --> 15:58.791
was Dr. Kazama.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.921
Full name, Heath Kazama Flick.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.342
My father.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.473
And...

16:14.557 --> 16:18.769
the one who first managed to decode
that inscription, at the age of 12,

16:20.021 --> 16:20.855
was me.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.801
<i>How many have you killed
<i>with that hand you stole?</i></i>

17:43.062 --> 17:46.524
<i>How much blood have you seen
<i>with that eye you stole?</i></i>

17:55.241 --> 17:59.620
<i>How many crimes have you fled from
<i>on that leg you stole?</i></i>

18:00.705 --> 18:02.623
They're pretty amazing, all right.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.824
Don't. Don't!

18:37.867 --> 18:39.076
Don't kill her, Koku!

18:40.620 --> 18:41.537
Stop it!

18:51.672 --> 18:52.632
It can't be.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.219
Yuna!

18:57.678 --> 18:58.929
How dare you!

19:04.602 --> 19:06.771
<i>Your time of atonement is at hand.</i>

19:19.450 --> 19:21.160
It's me, Yuna.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.290
You killed them!

19:27.541 --> 19:29.126
<i>Decide it together.</i>

19:30.586 --> 19:35.716
You killed all my classmates
at Jaula Blanca! All of my friends!

19:37.677 --> 19:40.012
<i>Will you be killed by your most beloved?</i>

19:40.513 --> 19:42.223
I'll never forgive you!

19:42.598 --> 19:45.017
<i>Or will you kill your most beloved?</i>

19:45.685 --> 19:47.895
-You're wrong, Yuna.
-Shut up!

19:48.521 --> 19:49.355
Yuna!

19:53.234 --> 19:54.068
It's time.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.382
This ends it.

20:22.096 --> 20:22.972
Yuna.

20:30.062 --> 20:30.896
I found you.

20:37.027 --> 20:40.573
When Canopus shines bright,
to the right is a new First,

20:41.365 --> 20:43.409
illegitimate spawn of the gods.

20:44.118 --> 20:48.205
Wings of pure madness
will bring low the ephemeral people,

20:48.998 --> 20:52.585
and the howls of the dead
will bring order to their brethren.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.600
