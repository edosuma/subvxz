WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:10.271
Previously onSWAT...Is Jim Street single?

00:10.314 --> 00:12.969
Aren't you worried it could get
a little messy with your dad?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.145
Maybe if I was 16 and it was
still any of his business.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.929
So you-you want me to find out?

00:16.973 --> 00:18.061
Are you still off
the dating apps?

00:18.105 --> 00:19.845
Oh, I'm done with the hustle.

00:19.889 --> 00:22.892
I'm just gonna let life
come to me from now on.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.546
Now, imagine these culinary
treats could come to you

00:24.589 --> 00:25.851
wherever you are...

00:25.895 --> 00:26.939
Like a delivery service.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.419
No, better.
Food truck.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.552
This could be, like,
a team investment, man.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.858
Do you remember the day
your father left us?

00:32.902 --> 00:36.166
And you went running down
the street after him, crying.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.646
DOCTOR:
The X-rays we did
on your lungs

00:37.689 --> 00:39.082
show an abnormal mass
right here.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.649
So lung cancer.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.216
DOCTOR: I want to do
a biopsy immediately.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.131
DANIEL:
I ain't doing no operation.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.046
If you don't want to get
that biopsy, it's your life.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.309
Don't let it be because you
think you deserve this cancer,

00:48.352 --> 00:49.484
'cause, Pop, you don't.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.094
I got a daughter
who I miss every day,

00:51.138 --> 00:52.313
and she won't even
speak to me.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.575
I just don't feel like
fighting anymore.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.011
HONDO:
I get Winnie to sit down

00:55.055 --> 00:56.099
with you after 30 years,

00:56.143 --> 00:57.318
then you get that biopsy.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.059
Is that a deal?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.932
â™ª

01:10.853 --> 01:12.159
HONDO:
Give me all your money!Oh...!

01:12.202 --> 01:14.422
[both laughing]Hondo.

01:14.465 --> 01:17.120
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.775
What are you doing in Vegas?
You got a work thing here?

01:19.818 --> 01:21.255
I can't just come visit
my big sister?

01:21.298 --> 01:23.083
Well, sure you can.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.997
You gonna stand there,
or you gonna give me a hug?

01:25.041 --> 01:27.087
Oh, whoa, whoa, how about
we wait till you take a shower?How about no?

01:27.130 --> 01:28.784
No. Come here.I'm just-- Oh, come on. Oh.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.133
Ooh, ooh, okay.[laughing]

01:30.177 --> 01:31.569
Okay, that's enough,
that's enough.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.093
Now, girl, you know better.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.399
You can't be out here
jogging in earbuds.

01:35.443 --> 01:36.705
Somebody could
come up behind you.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.141
What if I was
really a mugger?

01:38.185 --> 01:40.274
Then I would've
whupped your ass.
[laughs]

01:40.317 --> 01:41.840
You mean drown me
in your sweat maybe.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.104
[laughs]
It's Vegas. It's the desert.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.628
And this body is not gonna stay
in shape by itself anymore.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.717
Yeah, I see.[both laugh]

01:48.760 --> 01:50.153
Why didn't you let me
know you were coming?

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
I would've got the
spare room ready.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.157
I left you a couple of messages.
You never hit me back.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.638
You know, between my... my
work schedule at the casino

01:56.681 --> 01:58.292
and your saving the world,

01:58.335 --> 02:00.207
I didn't know when we'd
both be awake to talk.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.733
You're not here to
lose money on blackjack

02:04.776 --> 02:07.170
or for brother/sister
hang time, are you?

02:07.214 --> 02:09.694
Wish I was.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.957
Look, if this is about Dad,
I don't want to hear it.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.481
Winnie, it is about Dad.

02:13.524 --> 02:14.960
No.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.397
He really needs
to see you.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.399
No.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.401
He's about to have
surgery, Winnie.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.054
For what?

02:23.621 --> 02:25.319
Cancer.

02:25.362 --> 02:28.235
Now, they still got to do
a biopsy to see how bad it is,

02:28.278 --> 02:29.758
but Pops has cancer.

02:29.801 --> 02:33.022
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.155
I am, but...

02:35.198 --> 02:37.374
but he's got
another daughter.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.159
With a different mother,

02:39.202 --> 02:41.161
who he poured all
his love into.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.033
She can do the
hand holding now.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
He's got regrets.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.384
Enough regrets
that he doesn't think

02:47.428 --> 02:48.994
he deserves to beat this thing.

02:49.038 --> 02:52.346
Well, maybe he doesn't.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.217
Come on, Winnie,
just hear me out.[groans]

02:54.261 --> 02:56.611
Please.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.613
Look, the man is stubborn.

02:58.656 --> 03:01.398
We know where
you got it from, at least.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.226
Look, I'm not here
to cause you any grief.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.185
And you ain't got
no obligations.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.186
But he's scared.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.884
He's really scared.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.277
He only agreed to the biopsy

03:10.320 --> 03:12.192
if I was able to bring
the family back together.

03:12.235 --> 03:16.108
See, that's not fair, Hondo.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.328
You and I made a pact, remember?

03:18.372 --> 03:19.460
When he abandoned us.

03:19.503 --> 03:22.071
Yes, abandoned us

03:22.114 --> 03:25.335
and Mom
to start some new family.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.382
You and I swore we were never
gonna talk to him again.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.340
That was a long time ago.
We were kids.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.864
Well, I kept my promise
for 30 years.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.649
Why should I break it now?

03:34.692 --> 03:36.216
Because this might be
your only chance

03:36.259 --> 03:38.130
to get all this
off your chest to him.

03:38.174 --> 03:42.222
And because I'm not asking you
to forgive him, just see him.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.923
And because I am here
asking you to.

03:47.966 --> 03:51.448
I got to go to work tomorrow.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.798
The casino would shut down
if you called in sick

03:53.842 --> 03:55.365
for just a couple of days?

04:01.415 --> 04:02.981
LUCA:
Come and get it!

04:03.025 --> 04:05.767
Who said there's no such thing
as a free lunch?

04:05.810 --> 04:07.595
Make the most of it.

04:07.638 --> 04:10.075
Pretty soon, you're gonna have
to pay full freight for it.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.600
Hey. Where are you two
headed looking so fly?

04:12.643 --> 04:14.645
Protective detail on the
governor. Routine stuff.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.038
She's moderating a
human rights conference.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.258
I actually want to see
a couple of the speakers,

04:18.301 --> 04:20.042
especially Amina Abadi.Hey, we still got

04:20.085 --> 04:21.043
investment opportunities
in the food truck,

04:21.086 --> 04:22.044
if you're interested.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.263
Yeah? How much?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.352
Five grand a share.
It's a total steal, man.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.092
Five thousand?Yeah.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.833
You could book a surfing
trip to Hawaii for that.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.313
LUCA:
Taste this and
you'll be happy

04:30.357 --> 04:31.836
going camping in
your backyard, man.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.447
TAN:
Yo, I thought we had
enough investors.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.013
No offense, Rocker.

04:35.057 --> 04:38.060
Yeah, didn't we all
put in together, like, 30 grand?

04:38.103 --> 04:39.322
Yeah, I figure
with five grand more,

04:39.366 --> 04:40.454
we can get those
top-of-the-line broilers

04:40.497 --> 04:42.847
to go with that oven
that Tan kicked in.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.458
Increase our profits
by, like, 15%.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.895
Okay, and did you run this by
everyone who owns a stake?

04:46.938 --> 04:48.331
I thought you trusted me.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.506
Come on, this is
gonna be awesome.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.899
I just bought the vehicle.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.596
A little outfitting,
and we are gonna take

04:52.640 --> 04:54.511
the L.A. food truck scene
by storm, man.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.733
You ever, uh, done
an escape room?

04:58.776 --> 05:01.605
Uh, in real life, sure,
couple times.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.346
Never recreationally.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.739
A new one just
opened up in Venice.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.349
A few friends and I
are going later.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.829
Could use an
extra player.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.919
And, uh, no SWAT skills
necessary, just your brain.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.964
Oh, so we don't
use our brains on SWAT?

05:13.008 --> 05:15.271
[chuckles] No, that's
not what I meant.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
You want to come?

05:16.359 --> 05:18.187
Tonight?
Yeah.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.362
Uh, yeah. Sure.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.059
Okay, I'll text you
the address.
Okay.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.322
See you there.
Yeah.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.107
Hey, what's happening
with Molly?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.891
Oh, we're meeting up later.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.806
We're gonna do this
escape room thing.Oh, like a date?

05:28.850 --> 05:30.330
No, no, her friends
are gonna be there.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.070
You sure the boss's daughter
doesn't think it's a date?

05:32.114 --> 05:33.376
You better find
out quick, playa.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.986
All right, we got
to go. Come on.

05:35.030 --> 05:38.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, those are
for potential investors.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.514
Hey, minimum five grand
investment, okay?

05:40.557 --> 05:42.342
Gonna see profits
in, like, six months.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.303
What, do they think this is
a salvage yard or something?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.131
Hey, that's our baby!

05:51.263 --> 05:52.917
I'm thinking of naming her
Wilhelmena.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.052
Luca, is this the food truck
we invested in?

05:57.095 --> 05:59.141
Look, I said she'd need
a little outfitting,

05:59.184 --> 06:00.925
but I got her for a steal
at the police auction.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.319
You paid real money for this?[Luca laughs]

06:03.363 --> 06:04.973
Why'd the cops impound it?

06:05.016 --> 06:06.409
Oh, let's just say that

06:06.453 --> 06:08.585
they were selling more than
soft serve out of here.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.108
What, selling weed?

06:10.152 --> 06:11.501
Coke?

06:11.545 --> 06:13.068
Meth.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.156
Were they cooking meth
in here?

06:14.199 --> 06:15.157
Look, that's all in the past.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.637
All right?
A little cleanup,

06:16.680 --> 06:18.769
and Wilhelmena is gonna be
the best thing to happen

06:18.813 --> 06:20.771
to our profit margins,
trust me.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.382
No cook here.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.601
Oh, no, not right now, but wait
till I get it cleaned up.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.211
Hey, where you going, man?

06:26.255 --> 06:28.388
I thought you were gonna invest.Nice try.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.389
Rocker!

06:30.999 --> 06:32.522
All right. [laughs]

06:32.566 --> 06:34.568
Man, you're missing out.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.528
AMINA ABADI:
I'm so honored to be here

06:38.572 --> 06:40.138
to share my story.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.531
A year ago,

06:41.575 --> 06:44.186
men came to my home
in the middle of the night

06:44.229 --> 06:45.448
and took me away.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.537
I was imprisoned
for five months,

06:47.581 --> 06:51.193
with no access
to my family or a lawyer.

06:51.236 --> 06:55.676
I was beaten,
flogged, sexually abused,

06:55.719 --> 06:57.808
held in solitary confinement.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.245
Oh, my God.What was my crime?

07:00.289 --> 07:03.379
Along with five friends,
I had dared to protest

07:03.423 --> 07:05.860
the human rights abuses
in my country,

07:05.903 --> 07:08.471
as well as the lack
of equal rights for women.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.777
I've been following her story.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.735
She escaped from prison
by dressing as a guard.

07:11.779 --> 07:14.129
Eventually crossed the border
and applied for asylum.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.478
Brave woman.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.350
I'm here today to speak
on behalf of my friends,

07:18.394 --> 07:20.265
who are still in prison
back home,

07:20.309 --> 07:23.486
and to ask you to join me
in calling for their release,

07:23.530 --> 07:25.706
as well as an end to the torture

07:25.749 --> 07:28.143
of innocent people
whose only crime

07:28.186 --> 07:32.495
is seeking equality,
justice and freedom.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.018
[crowd cheering]

07:34.062 --> 07:35.542
Shukrun.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.414
WOMAN:
Keep up the good work!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.851
That was a great speech.Thank you.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.593
Still getting used to
speaking in public.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.900
And, honestly, I don't know
what good it will do.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.511
They'll listen.
They have to.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.208
I love my country.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.036
The West has the
wrong idea of it.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.125
Many of the people
are kind and generous.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.605
It's only a
small minority

07:55.649 --> 07:58.303
who are closed-minded
and prejudiced.

07:58.347 --> 08:01.176
But many of them are in power
and do not listen to women.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.744
Route's clear.
Let's go.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.962
GOVERNOR:
...delighted to be here today,

08:05.006 --> 08:07.269
lending our voice
and our support

08:07.312 --> 08:09.663
to the vital work
of human rights campaigners,

08:09.706 --> 08:12.883
both internationally
and locally, who continue

08:12.927 --> 08:14.406
the fight for equality.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.887
Got movement. Your two.
Black cap.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.063
Looks like he
might be armed.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.457
Stay with the governor.
All perimeter units, male, 30s,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.241
wearing a black cap
with a possible weapon.

08:23.285 --> 08:26.114
...the ideal of a democratic
and free society in which

08:26.157 --> 08:29.030
all persons live together
with equal opportunities.

08:29.073 --> 08:32.163
For many people
in the world today...

08:32.207 --> 08:33.904
Move on him slowly.
Let's not cause a panic.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.298
GOVERNOR:
But we hope that
by continuing...

08:36.341 --> 08:37.342
He's reaching
for something.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.648
MAN:
Gun!

08:38.692 --> 08:40.345
Governor, come with us![panicked shouting]

08:40.389 --> 08:42.391
Move, move![crowd clamoring]

08:42.434 --> 08:44.306
Let's go! Let's go!
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

08:45.873 --> 08:46.874
Move, move, move, move!

08:49.354 --> 08:50.355
Go, go, go!

08:59.364 --> 09:01.758
This way. Follow me.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.639
[door closes]Principal in the safe room.

09:12.682 --> 09:13.988
24-David, what's your status?

09:14.031 --> 09:16.077
We lost him.
Keep the governor in a safe room

09:16.120 --> 09:18.166
until we secure the perimeter.
Additional units are en route.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.428
Roger that.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.517
[gunshot, panicked shouting]

09:22.605 --> 09:24.433
Go, go, go, go.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.869
Amina!

09:25.913 --> 09:27.436
You hit?Yeah, I got my vest on.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.046
I'm okay.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.269
[engine starts]

09:34.312 --> 09:36.271
LAPD!

09:36.314 --> 09:37.533
[tires screeching]

09:39.622 --> 09:41.624
24-David, two suspects.
Armed and dangerous.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.365
They kidnapped Amina Abadi.
They're headed south

09:43.408 --> 09:44.801
in a black SUV.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.805
â™ª

10:23.884 --> 10:26.582
HONDO:
Appreciate you, doc.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.236
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Dr. Chang, 2298.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.238
Dr. Chang, 2298.

10:32.196 --> 10:35.069
Hey, Pop.Hmm.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.418
Look who's here.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.037
Look at you.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.344
How you doing?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.781
As well as to be expected.
I'm about to be sawed in two.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.653
It's a basic
procedure, Pop.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.350
Hondo said
it's a biopsy.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.265
They're taking
a piece of my lung.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.398
I'm so glad you're here.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.097
Thank you.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.664
We're here to help you
get through this, Pop.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.448
You know,
just thinking about that

11:06.491 --> 11:09.277
you might come here today
got me reminiscing.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.889
Do y'all remember
when I used to take you both out

11:12.933 --> 11:14.412
to dinner every Friday night?

11:14.456 --> 11:16.371
We always used to go
to Pup 'N' Taco.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.981
Those green chili burritos.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.201
Yeah, we were never allowed
to get the cherry slush, though.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.985
"Y'all ain't gonna go spilling
in my back seat, you hear me?"

11:22.029 --> 11:25.206
That's 'cause it was good vinyl.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.686
And those were good times.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.687
[chuckles]

11:27.730 --> 11:29.601
Good times.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.343
Shame you had ruin it by leaving
us to start another family.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.605
HONDO:
Winnie.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.956
No, no, it's all right.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.480
Let her go and say
what she want to say.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.178
That's why you're here,
ain't it?

11:42.136 --> 11:43.703
Thinks I'm on my death bed,

11:43.746 --> 11:45.139
so time for last shots.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.184
That's not why
she's here, Pop.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.229
Then why, then, son?

11:48.272 --> 11:49.360
Because he made me come.

11:49.404 --> 11:52.233
Well, ain't nobody
making you stay.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.756
You did your good deed.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.150
Okay.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.542
No, no. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.Stop, Hondo.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.371
Pl-Please. Just, please. Pop,

12:00.415 --> 12:02.156
isn't there something you've
been wanting to say to Winnie?

12:06.203 --> 12:09.511
I'm sorry for hurting you
back then like that.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.775
And hurting our mother.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.255
And hurting your mother.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.914
Okay.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.916
You've apologized.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.135
I guess we can get back
to our lives now.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.441
Winnie. Winnie.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.443
What the hell you want from me,
huh? I'm just...

12:28.486 --> 12:30.053
[coughing]
BRIANNA:
Dad?
Pop.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.446
Pop, Pop.Dad, are you okay?

12:31.489 --> 12:32.926
Hey!Pop, are you all right? Pop?

12:32.969 --> 12:34.928
I didn't know you'd be here.Well, I was just leaving.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.277
Winnie. Winnie, come on. Winnie.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.497
She's stubborn, just
like your mother!

12:42.805 --> 12:44.546
[coughs]You okay?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.243
I'm all right, baby.Yeah?

12:46.287 --> 12:47.941
Winnie, where are you going?
Come on, now.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
Look, Hondo, I tried.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.032
All right?
It's not gonna work.

12:52.075 --> 12:53.555
Now, I love you.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.340
I know this is
important to you,

12:56.384 --> 12:57.864
[voice breaking]:
but he threw us away.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.823
And you might have
made peace with that,

13:00.867 --> 13:02.912
but I-I can't.[elevator bell dings]

13:04.392 --> 13:06.394
Sorry.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.792
[phone beeping]

13:20.451 --> 13:21.931
Governor's pressing us
hard to find Amina.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.803
FBI's running an
investigation.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.283
They know we'll be
working the case, too.This is on me.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.198
Your job was to keep the
governor safe, and you did that.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.896
I know, but after everything
she's already been through,

13:29.939 --> 13:31.462
I let them get her.She had her own
security detail, Chris.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.855
We got to find her.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.509
Okay, Commander Hicks
is in Chicago

13:34.552 --> 13:36.598
leading a tactics seminar,
so we're on our own on this one.

13:36.641 --> 13:37.599
What do we know so far?

13:37.642 --> 13:39.775
Victim is Amina Abadi, age 24.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.081
Been agitating for the release

13:41.124 --> 13:42.473
of her friends
in prison back home.

13:42.517 --> 13:45.085
The media have dubbed them
the Freedom Five.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.608
It's got to be her government,
trying to shut her up.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.479
I've got access to
the NSA surveillance feed

13:48.523 --> 13:50.481
of their consulate and all
their suspected safe houses.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.528
How'd you get that?Well, we all have
our sources, don't we?

13:53.571 --> 13:54.877
So far, no sign of Amina.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.226
Are there any other suspects?Anyone pissed off

13:56.270 --> 13:58.489
she's talking about
women's rights.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.535
We don't know who kidnapped her
yet. Until we get more intel,

14:00.578 --> 14:01.623
we drill down on
every possibility.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.538
Amina's bodyguard's
been brought in.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.583
Hopefully, he saw something
besides the bullet that hit him.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.889
Amina's aunt and uncle
are also on their way in.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.282
They live in L.A.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.500
Thought maybe they have ties
to their community here.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.502
Let's go talk to the bodyguard.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.287
HONDO:
I'm Sergeant Harrelson.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.898
You know Officer Alonso.Yeah.
How you doing?

14:15.942 --> 14:18.596
Well, Kevlar saved me. I only
got the wind knocked out of me.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.902
Have you found Amina?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.078
Not yet.I begged her to
go into hiding

14:22.122 --> 14:23.558
until things cooled down.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.995
She insisted on giving
that speech first.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.823
She's been receiving threats?Dozens.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.520
Phone calls late at night,

14:29.564 --> 14:32.915
memes posted online
that are just disgusting.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.482
Some troll said that
if she didn't shut up,

14:34.525 --> 14:37.528
she was gonna get her throat
cut, acid thrown on her,

14:37.572 --> 14:38.834
that her family would be harmed.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.488
You know who's behind
the threats?

14:40.531 --> 14:41.837
All anonymous.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.578
I tried tracing them
but couldn't get anywhere.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.580
We'll need to see those files.Sure.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.538
Do you think it's her government
targeting her?

14:47.582 --> 14:48.757
The guys that took her
looked military to me.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.932
I mean, they knew
what they were doing.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.020
And the guns
they were using,

14:51.064 --> 14:53.544
LWRC, ultra compact...

14:53.588 --> 14:55.546
Same guns their military use.You must have been

14:55.590 --> 14:57.244
pretty close to be able
to I.D. their weapons.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.811
Point-blank. Hurt like hell.We're gonna need ballistics

14:59.855 --> 15:00.943
to take a look at this.[cell phone chimes]

15:00.987 --> 15:03.511
Be my guest.The aunt and uncle are here.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.040
We warned our niece
that this could happen.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.129
We were afraid for her,
but she would not listen.

15:13.173 --> 15:16.306
We know Amina had enemies,
got a lot of threats.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.308
She upset many people.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.962
Including the royal family?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.572
Aren't they at the top
of the list?

15:21.616 --> 15:23.096
Things are changing
back home,

15:23.139 --> 15:25.098
but it wasn't fast
enough for Amina.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.100
It is still
a very traditional country,

15:27.143 --> 15:29.145
and Amina is not traditional.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.365
She rejected the culture
and the religion.

15:31.408 --> 15:34.281
Many people did not
take kindly to her words.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.326
We can use your help
finding her.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.155
Do you have any connections
back home who might...Home?

15:39.199 --> 15:41.114
This is home.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.550
We are American citizens.

15:42.593 --> 15:45.596
My wife and I have been
living here for 26 years.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.381
We raised our
family here.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.731
We have few contact
with the kingdom anymore.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.733
How about connections here
in L.A. within your community?

15:51.776 --> 15:52.908
People talk.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.127
People are afraid.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.346
They don't want trouble.Including you?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.609
Trouble has already
found our family.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.700
The longer
Amina's gone...

16:02.744 --> 16:04.006
You know how it works, Chris.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.138
We keep scouring the ground,

16:05.181 --> 16:07.183
we'll eventually find
a footprint.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.011
They discover who was
behind the online threats?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.404
No. But I got something better.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.101
Preliminary ballistics says
that the bullet

16:12.145 --> 16:13.363
that hit the bodyguard's vest
was tampered with.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.712
It barely mushroomed.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.366
They think that half
the grain was emptied

16:16.410 --> 16:18.412
before it was fired,
but they're still running tests.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.153
I knew there was something funky
about the impact on that vest.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.937
That caliber round
shot point-blank

16:21.981 --> 16:24.244
should have cratered it,
but it barely made a scratch.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.159
So the kidnappers were firing
nonlethal rounds?

16:26.202 --> 16:28.378
No, they were lethal. The
bullets fired at the conference

16:28.422 --> 16:29.901
were all normal 6.8s.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.164
Every single one of them
should have been deadly,

16:31.207 --> 16:32.513
but they were all fired
above head height.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.210
They weren't aiming
to kill anyone.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.299
And the one that did hit
was tampered with.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.214
And it hit the bodyguard
center mass like he stood still

16:38.258 --> 16:41.087
with a bull's-eye on his chest.
They were putting on a show.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.697
So he was in on the kidnapping?

16:42.740 --> 16:45.134
Lynch is looking
into him now.[sighs]

16:45.178 --> 16:48.268
Hey, uh, think I should cancel
on Molly tonight?

16:48.311 --> 16:49.356
What do you mean, your date?

16:49.399 --> 16:51.532
It's not a date.Come on, dude.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.751
This is Dominique Luca
you're talking to here.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.319
You telling me
you're not interested?

16:56.363 --> 16:57.842
Give me the real, bro.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.671
Look, she's smart,
she's gorgeous,

17:00.715 --> 17:02.151
she's a really great person,

17:02.195 --> 17:04.762
but dating
Commander Hicks' daughter?

17:04.806 --> 17:05.981
I've had some pretty big

17:06.025 --> 17:07.287
screwups here,
but that would be...

17:07.330 --> 17:08.984
Look, look, look,
it's not the dating part

17:09.028 --> 17:10.203
you need to worry about,
lover boy.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.421
It's the breaking up part.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.032
My cousin Amy dated a cop once.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.424
Right? Regular patrol officer.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.773
When the guy broke her heart,

17:15.817 --> 17:18.341
my dad made sure
that he never made detective.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.865
I'm just saying.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.433
Whoa! Check out Wilhelmena!

17:23.477 --> 17:25.827
Holy crap.
That's what I call a makeover.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.395
If this doesn't make Xiomara
happy, I don't know what will.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.397
Hey. The cleaners found
this under the front seat.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.616
Also said it took them a
while to get the stains

17:32.660 --> 17:35.619
out of the countertops.What do you mean?
Rust stains?

17:35.663 --> 17:37.795
Blood. You know someone
got murdered in there?

17:37.839 --> 17:39.232
For real?What?

17:39.275 --> 17:40.755
Yeah. Same crew cleaned up
the crime scene.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.627
Someone murder?
Uh, no.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.151
Murder truck?

17:45.194 --> 17:46.369
Look, you'd never know.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.849
I mean, they did a great job

17:47.892 --> 17:49.416
cleaning it up.
It's spotless.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.157
Madre de Dios. Oh, come on. Xiomara.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.420
No, no, no, no.
Give it a chance.New truck.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.422
I-I sunk almost all our money
into this thing.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.119
New truck or new cook.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.253
Xiomara. Come on.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.040
What do you got?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.259
Bodyguard's name
is Zack Willert.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.912
Ex-Army Ranger.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.784
Been working close protection
since 2009

18:09.827 --> 18:11.438
and spent the last decade
protecting this guy,

18:11.481 --> 18:13.440
Christopher Wardlow.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.355
Should I know him?He's a property tycoon.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.357
Fingers in a load
of construction downtown.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.141
LYNCH:
He's behind that new office
building near Skid Row

18:19.185 --> 18:20.577
that looks like an
arthritic pickle.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.014
And according to my sources...What, the secret ones?

18:23.058 --> 18:25.887
No, the Internet-- Wardlow
is a major shareholder

18:25.930 --> 18:27.715
in a luxury hotel project
in Amina's homeland

18:27.758 --> 18:29.499
that's currently stalled.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.022
Wardlow's trying to grease palms
with the royal family

18:31.066 --> 18:32.894
by offering Amina
in the place of cash?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.678
That'd be pretty evil.DEACON: Yeah, but it
could be a way

18:34.722 --> 18:36.332
to get his hotel project
back on track.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.378
What are we waiting for?
Where's this guy Wardlow live?

18:41.424 --> 18:43.905
The SUV in the drive
matches the one Chris saw

18:43.948 --> 18:46.168
driving away from the scene
of the kidnapping.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.778
You are good to enter.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.000
DEACON:
Secure the perimeter.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.436
Watch the cross fire.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.048
Access to the NSA's surveillance
feed on the consulate,

18:57.092 --> 18:59.529
how'd you get that?Someone I met while
hiking Machu Picchu.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.444
It's amazing who I come
into contact with

19:01.488 --> 19:02.880
when I get out in the world.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.145
â™ª

19:09.670 --> 19:11.411
Camera.

19:28.689 --> 19:31.605
LUCA:
Okay, drone footage shows
something in the pool.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.433
26-David.

19:33.476 --> 19:36.566
Body, male.
Looks to be shot in the back.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.134
HONDO: Is it Wardlow?No, I think
it's a security guard.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.484
Someone got there before us.Watch your backs.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.189
DEACON:
Approaching the one-side
entry point.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.456
[beeping]

19:58.762 --> 20:00.024
I got visual on two more bodies.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.244
Look like more guards.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.507
Street.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.293
STREET:
Ready for entry.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.294
Breach on my mark.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.469
Three, two, one.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.253
Go.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.306
There's a blood trail.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.449
Gun!

20:36.757 --> 20:39.281
DEACON:
Bathroom clear!

20:39.325 --> 20:41.631
All clear!30-David to Command.

20:41.675 --> 20:42.937
Two suspects down.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.634
We found Wardlow.
He's been tortured.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.549
He's not looking good.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.160
We took down one suspect.
The rest of the house is clear.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.336
30-David, we're Code 4.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.381
Okay to bring paramedics in.

20:52.425 --> 20:53.817
No I.D.'s.Where is she?

20:53.861 --> 20:55.428
Where's Amina?
Not here.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.820
You took her, though.
It was your men

20:56.864 --> 20:57.952
who kidnapped her earlier today.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.736
Wasn't a kidnapping.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.522
It was staged.
It was a hoax.

21:02.565 --> 21:05.046
What? Why?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.395
Amina was in danger.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.050
We thought a fake
kidnapping would...

21:09.093 --> 21:11.922
throw a spotlight on
her friends in jail.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.490
So she could get away.Amina was in on it?

21:14.534 --> 21:16.318
I came up with the plan.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.493
What exactly was your plan?

21:17.537 --> 21:19.321
Fly her to safety.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.888
Get her into hiding.

21:20.931 --> 21:23.325
I was supposed to meet
her and her boyfriend.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.285
Where?Garden Avenue Airfield.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.330
Like, an hour ago.Did you tell the shooters

21:28.374 --> 21:29.723
where you were
gonna meet them?

21:33.988 --> 21:35.859
I'm sorry.30-David. All units,

21:35.903 --> 21:36.991
armed suspects en route

21:37.034 --> 21:38.122
to Garden Avenue Airfield.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.173
Wardlow should
be here by now.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.740
Something must have happened.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.311
We need to go.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.922
Five more minutes.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.325
[siren wailing]

22:08.239 --> 22:09.415
They got a 20-minute
head start.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.851
Almost there.Every available unit

22:10.894 --> 22:13.070
in the area's en route
to the airfield, plus a bird.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.724
We figured out
who these guys are yet?No.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.205
How'd the bad guys know
Wardlow was helping Amina?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.815
I'm guessing they bugged
her phone and her e-mails.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.209
Whoever these guys are,
they're not playing.We're here!

22:30.436 --> 22:33.177
Unis checked the whole place.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.615
We're too late.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.444
Wardlow's in surgery.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.097
They broke his jaw
pulling teeth.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.534
He managed to give us
some intel, though,

22:41.577 --> 22:43.231
before they
put him under.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.450
It turns out he's business
partners with the father

22:44.493 --> 22:46.016
of one of the Freedom Five.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.496
That's why he's been
helping Amina.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.193
Okay. Well, I pulled
everything I could

22:49.237 --> 22:50.412
on Amina's boyfriend.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.196
Name's Kareem Kashani,

22:52.240 --> 22:54.677
human rights director
at a nonprofit in D.C.

22:54.721 --> 22:57.811
They've been dating six months.
He flew into LAX this morning.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.248
Is there any reason
to think he'd betray her?

23:00.291 --> 23:02.424
Well, his credit card
statement shows he just spent

23:02.468 --> 23:04.383
four months' salary on
a two-carat diamond ring

23:04.426 --> 23:06.297
from Tiffany's, so
I'm thinking not.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.430
I think he was planning
to escape with her.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.171
Think I got something.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.173
Kareem, or someone
using his credit card,

23:12.216 --> 23:14.523
rented a car close to the
airfield about 20 minutes ago.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.395
Okay, they'll have
a tracker in that car.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.397
Already running
a trace on it.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.790
Got a fix.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.097
This is 20-David to all
available units.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.926
Respond to the area of Echo Park
for a kidnapping vehicle.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.494
[helicopter whirring]

23:28.537 --> 23:30.670
[sirens wailing]

23:30.713 --> 23:33.977
ROCKER:
50-David, approaching vehicle,
can't see inside.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.458
Be alert. We don't know
who's in that car.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.771
ROCKER:
Just Kareem. No one else.

23:44.814 --> 23:47.382
Where the hell's Amina?

23:53.649 --> 23:54.911
So, that's Amina's
boyfriend?

23:54.955 --> 23:56.435
Yeah. Heard he's refusing
to speak.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.175
Why?Well, he probably thinks

23:58.219 --> 23:59.525
he's protecting her
by keeping quiet.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.614
So he rented the car
to create a diversion,

24:01.657 --> 24:02.919
thinking the bad guys
would follow him,

24:02.963 --> 24:05.269
allowing Amina the
chance to escape.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.141
That's either really romantic...Or really stupid.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.317
Someone needs to remind this guy
we're trying to help

24:09.360 --> 24:10.666
keep his girlfriend alive.Yeah.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.799
Now, wait a second.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.322
I know you admire her.Yeah, I've been

24:14.365 --> 24:16.106
reading about her ever since
she first came to the U.S.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.500
Yeah. Me, too. What?

24:18.544 --> 24:20.328
You got to go
through the news section

24:20.371 --> 24:22.069
to get to the sports section,
right?

24:22.112 --> 24:23.549
I read.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.812
I told her the world
would hear her.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.292
But what if it doesn't?
What if it's all for nothing?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.643
She stood up for her friends,
for girls and women everywhere,

24:30.686 --> 24:32.688
and this might
cost her everything.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.037
You should talk
to the boyfriend,

24:34.081 --> 24:35.561
tell him what you
just told me.

24:35.604 --> 24:36.736
If anyone can
convince him

24:36.779 --> 24:38.346
that we're on their
side, it's you.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.175
Thanks.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.874
STEVENS:
Street.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.528
Just heard from Hicks.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.051
He wants you to do
an inventory of the armory.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.096
He called from Chicago

24:49.139 --> 24:50.924
to assign me
inventory duty?

24:50.967 --> 24:52.621
Yeah. Wants it done by tonight.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.536
Hey, you think
Hicks found out

24:54.580 --> 24:56.538
about you and Molly
hitting the town?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.409
I'm telling you,
nothing gets past that man.

24:58.453 --> 25:00.324
He's got me counting bullets.
If that's not a warning,

25:00.368 --> 25:01.587
I'd hate to see what is.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.899
I'm Chris.
Can I get you anything?

25:12.293 --> 25:15.514
I was there this morning
when Amina gave her speech.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.951
We chatted after.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.605
She's an incredible woman.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.346
I guess you don't need
me telling you that.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.957
I know you love her,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.612
and you think you're
protecting her,

25:26.655 --> 25:29.440
but she's in very real danger
right now.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.878
You need to tell me
where she is.

25:31.921 --> 25:35.621
I promised her I wouldn't
betray her to anyone, ever.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.971
Even one person knowing
is one too many.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.973
It's all it takes
to get her killed.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.583
Wardlow's in the hospital,
you know that?

25:41.627 --> 25:42.889
They tortured him

25:42.932 --> 25:44.586
until he gave up your location.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.588
But we left before they arrived.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.851
Amina got away.
I made sure of it.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.508
We had a plan.

25:55.554 --> 26:00.907
I know that Amina escaped
from prison back home.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.997
I know that she's brave.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.694
I know that you want to
believe that she's managing

26:05.738 --> 26:07.522
on her own out there,
but I'm telling you,

26:07.566 --> 26:08.915
these people either
already have her,

26:08.958 --> 26:10.656
or they're minutes away from it.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.527
So, if you ever want
to see her again

26:12.571 --> 26:15.530
and give her that engagement
ring that you bought her,

26:15.574 --> 26:17.010
you need to talk to me.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.799
The Greyhound station.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.496
Downtown.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.237
That's where she's heading.

26:27.281 --> 26:28.587
Thank you.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.241
Chris. It's too late.

26:35.028 --> 26:38.118
This video was just released
online and to the news stations.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.990
It is with sincerest regrets
that I make my apology

26:41.034 --> 26:44.428
to the American people,
as well as to my own countrymen.

26:44.472 --> 26:47.431
The kidnapping this morning
was a hoax.

26:47.475 --> 26:50.826
As you can see,
I am safe and well.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.568
I made up false claims
and staged my own kidnapping

26:53.612 --> 26:57.006
in order to make it look
like I was in danger,

26:57.050 --> 27:00.401
that my homeland
was responsible for the crimes,

27:00.444 --> 27:03.578
when in fact,
it was myself who was guilty.This is coerced.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.625
I have been charged with treason
against my country,

27:06.668 --> 27:08.627
a charge that I accept.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.107
I am now returning home where
I will accept my punishment.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.675
Treason?
That's a death sentence.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.641
I have been charged with treason
against my country,

27:22.684 --> 27:24.381
a charge that I accept.

27:24.425 --> 27:27.080
I am now returning home where
I will accept my punishment.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.302
No.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.610
There's no way she recorded this
of her own free will.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.003
We're trying
to track down nationals

27:37.046 --> 27:39.527
from Amina's home country
who are in the L.A. area

27:39.570 --> 27:41.660
and loyal to the government,
but it's a slow process.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.270
What else can we do?

27:43.313 --> 27:44.532
Hold up.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.708
Those are prayer
beads, right?
Yeah.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.971
The aunt had some identical
to them when she came in.

27:49.015 --> 27:51.757
Amina's aunt? She was here?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.062
Yes, and her uncle. Why?

27:53.106 --> 27:55.325
Amina doesn't talk
to her uncle or aunt anymore.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.718
They had a falling out.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.459
About what?She thought,

27:58.502 --> 28:00.026
because they lived
in America for so long,

28:00.069 --> 28:01.549
that they would
understand her views

28:01.592 --> 28:03.507
and support her protest
against the government.

28:03.551 --> 28:04.683
But they didn't.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.641
They tried to convince her
to return home,

28:06.685 --> 28:08.730
pressured her,
even threatened her.

28:08.774 --> 28:09.949
She didn't tell the police?

28:09.992 --> 28:11.646
Just me.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.605
What you need to understand
about her culture

28:14.649 --> 28:17.434
is that faith and family honor
are everything.

28:17.478 --> 28:20.002
Amina speaking out about the
government and criticizing them

28:20.046 --> 28:22.091
brought her extended family
great shame.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.614
They lost face.And the only way

28:23.658 --> 28:26.443
to regain face is by
delivering Amina back home

28:26.487 --> 28:28.141
for the leaders
to punish her.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.882
So the men who took Amina
were getting paid by her uncle.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.535
Probably mercenaries.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.755
This isn't connected to
their government at all.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.757
We need to get to her
uncle's house now.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.890
Houses. Her uncle
has homes all over.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.414
Bel Air,
Palm Springs, New York.

28:40.457 --> 28:41.720
Even a yacht.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.678
The airports have her flagged.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.811
The yacht. That's how they're
planning on getting her out.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.987
You just sail into
international waters.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.342
[siren wailing]

28:55.385 --> 28:56.647
Just talked to the marina.

28:56.691 --> 28:57.736
Amina's uncle's trying
to have his boat refueled.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.433
Chris was right.

28:59.476 --> 29:00.651
They're trying
to get her out by sea.

29:00.695 --> 29:01.914
Looks like they're
on the move.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.437
LUCA:
Hondo, you get all that?

29:03.480 --> 29:04.917
Roger that. We're almost there.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.571
Can the harbormaster
stop the launch?Hey, Luca,

29:07.615 --> 29:09.530
ask the harbormaster
if he can slow things down.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.793
Tell the unis to stand down
until we get there, too.Yep.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.447
Risk to the public's
way too high.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.318
These guys are trigger-happy.What about the Coast Guard?

29:15.362 --> 29:17.233
They're on alert. Will stop
the boat if it hits open water.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.800
STREET:
Question is,
what do they do

29:18.844 --> 29:20.889
to Amina when they see
they're surrounded?

29:22.804 --> 29:23.674
Two minutes out!HONDO:
Okay.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.285
Stay liquid,

29:25.328 --> 29:26.808
and let's bring
Amina back alive.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.644
Just need a quick signature.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.824
Where you headed?

29:42.868 --> 29:45.740
LAPD. Show me your hands.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.176
On your knees.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.091
Get out of here. Move.On your stomach.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.353
Move. Get out of here.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.051
Down.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.704
On the ground now.
Get down.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.010
TAN:
Don't move.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.753
HONDO:
We'll search the boat for Amina.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.148
Stevens, cover.
Deacon, Chris, you're with me.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.806
â™ª

30:23.169 --> 30:24.953
[quietly]:
On your feet.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.825
On your feet.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.783
Let me see your hands.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.654
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.312
26-David. Found the aunt.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.010
No sign of Amina.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.106
LAPD!Show me your hands.

30:47.149 --> 30:48.498
Hands behind your back.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.675
Where is she?

30:51.719 --> 30:52.894
What?Where's the girl?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.461
What girl?Don't play dumb.
Where is she?

30:54.504 --> 30:55.723
We ain't got
time for games.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.725
Tell us where Amina is
right now.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.248
I don't know anything
about a girl.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.859
They pay my wage,
I don't ask questions.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.295
What were your
instructions?

31:02.338 --> 31:04.688
Head out 12 nautical miles,
drop anchor and wait.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.821
They said another boat
was gonna meet up with us.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.344
12 miles,
international waters.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.693
They must be taking
Amina by speedboat

31:09.737 --> 31:10.956
from another
launch point.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.131
Somewhere quieter,
more private.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.567
It's easier
than bringing her

31:13.610 --> 31:15.221
on board a yacht
in the middle of the marina.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.962
There's too many people here,
and she could make a scene.

31:17.005 --> 31:18.746
Is there a private launch
or dock somewhere nearby?

31:18.789 --> 31:20.182
The boatyard next door.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.097
A few private slips.HONDO: Luca, you get that?

31:22.141 --> 31:23.533
LUCA:
Yeah, looking.

31:23.577 --> 31:24.926
LYNCH:
Coast Guard had to respond to

31:24.970 --> 31:26.188
a fishing boat taking on water.

31:26.232 --> 31:27.581
They can't get there.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.452
We don't get to them now,
we've lost her for good.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.852
STREET: Pulling into the boatyard now. [siren wailing]

31:37.896 --> 31:39.680
Spotted possible
target vehicle.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.469
Keep them back! And you, move!

31:46.513 --> 31:48.297
CHRIS:
Malik's gonna get
away with Amina!

31:49.820 --> 31:51.779
Jim, cover!Street! Tan!

31:55.261 --> 31:58.264
Take it, Chris!
I'm gonna try to flank 'em.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.353
Once I get 'em to return fire,
make your move.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.311
Go get Amina back! Stevens!

32:08.230 --> 32:09.971
Let's do this. Cover.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.368
Move.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.416
It's clear.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.425
STREET:
This guy was hit pretty bad.

32:29.469 --> 32:30.992
TAN:
Couldn't have gone too far.

32:32.428 --> 32:33.995
Rabbit in a trap.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.693
Two ways out of this:
surrender or bleed out!

32:36.737 --> 32:38.260
What's it gonna be?

32:40.219 --> 32:41.394
We got our answer.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.396
But we can't let
him bleed out.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.311
[whimpering]Go. I told you, move it.

32:46.442 --> 32:47.835
Drop your weapon!

32:47.878 --> 32:50.098
Move! Move! Move!
Drop it!

32:50.142 --> 32:52.274
Stay back! Stay back!Drop it!

32:52.318 --> 32:54.233
Let her go!Drop your weapon now!

32:54.276 --> 32:55.495
I'll kill her, I swear!
Stay back!

32:55.538 --> 32:57.236
Let her go.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.933
Go, go.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.153
â™ª

33:12.468 --> 33:14.383
Hands! Hands now!

33:18.474 --> 33:19.388
Let her go.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.130
[grunting]

33:22.174 --> 33:23.871
[groans][yelps, gasps]

33:24.785 --> 33:26.569
On your stomach.CHRIS: It's okay.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.310
It's okay. It's all right.DEACON: Hands behind your back.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.834
Hey, you okay?
It's over.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.967
It's over. Hey.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.969
CHRIS:
It's okay.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.449
It's over.

33:36.492 --> 33:37.754
DEACON:
30-David.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.800
Need an R/A at dock 27.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.291
Chris, just spoke
to the D.A.'s office.

33:52.334 --> 33:53.944
They're weighing up
the charges against Wardlow

33:53.988 --> 33:55.511
for the hoax kidnapping,
and they don't think

33:55.555 --> 33:57.339
he'll do any time.And what about Amina?

33:57.383 --> 33:59.080
Are they charging her?

33:59.124 --> 34:00.168
Apparently,
there's not enough evidence

34:00.212 --> 34:01.735
she was involved
in the planning, so no.

34:01.778 --> 34:02.866
And no civilians
were hurt.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.303
I think they want
to focus on the win.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.087
Amina wanted
a spotlight.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.349
She got it.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.049
Her friends have been
released from prison?

34:11.092 --> 34:13.094
They're free?Spotlight got too hot.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.443
The kidnapping got media
outlets around the world

34:14.487 --> 34:15.923
to highlight all the
human rights abuses

34:15.966 --> 34:17.316
going on over there.

34:17.359 --> 34:18.447
Government had no
choice but to bow

34:18.491 --> 34:19.970
to the international
pressure.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.842
And the governor herself
wanted me to pass along

34:21.885 --> 34:24.323
her gratitude,
and so did the FBI.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.672
Good work.

34:35.899 --> 34:38.163
Did you hear about your friends?Yes.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.512
Kareem just told me.

34:39.555 --> 34:40.774
I guess you made the world
hear you.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.471
[chuckles]

34:42.515 --> 34:43.516
Where will you
go now?

34:43.559 --> 34:44.952
To D.C. with Kareem.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.649
I'm going to keep speaking up.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.738
And one day, maybe,

34:48.782 --> 34:51.611
when things change,
I'll return home.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.788
Thank you.

35:00.054 --> 35:02.752
Hey. Thought you
had plans tonight.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.798
Hicks has me
counting bullets.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.410
Go on.What?

35:08.454 --> 35:10.151
If you get a move on,
you'll still make it.

35:10.195 --> 35:13.023
Seriously?
You don't have to do this.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.200
I know. So stop
reminding me.

35:15.896 --> 35:18.507
Hey. Thank you.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.856
I owe you.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.472
Hondo.

35:26.515 --> 35:28.169
Hey.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.040
Hey, this a bad time?
I know you're busy.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.607
No, it's all good.
We just got done.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.218
I was just leaving. Come on.

35:35.002 --> 35:37.700
So, where you been?
I tried calling you.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.138
Man, I just needed
some air by myself.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.096
I went for a walk around
the old neighborhood.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.838
Well, it's been a minute
since you've been back.Yeah.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.535
Hey, you remember
that old vinyl store

35:46.579 --> 35:48.885
on the corner of Ashby?Hmm. Oh, yeah.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.974
That music booth saw
a whole lot of action,

35:51.018 --> 35:53.716
and I'm not talking the
listening kind, either.[both chuckle]

35:53.760 --> 35:55.936
They turned it into
a hot yoga studio.

35:55.979 --> 35:58.112
You know, yoga's bad enough;
now you got to do it in a sauna?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.896
Yeah, the world keeps
changing, Winnie.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.115
That's just a way of saying

36:01.159 --> 36:03.465
that we are getting
older, brother.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.641
So, what's up? You need
a ride to the airport?

36:05.685 --> 36:08.035
You sure? It's not
out of your way?

36:08.078 --> 36:10.820
Hospital's on that
part of town.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.779
Pop's surgery is in an hour.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.522
How could you forgive
him so easy, Hondo?

36:16.565 --> 36:18.611
I'm not.You think one little apology

36:18.654 --> 36:20.743
makes up for everything
he did to us?I don't.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.963
Walking out on us,
starting a whole new family,

36:23.006 --> 36:24.225
not even bothering
with his old one?

36:24.269 --> 36:26.532
I'm not saying it's enough.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.186
I'm saying it's a step.

36:29.796 --> 36:32.059
He is so scared
about this surgery.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.017
He's even more scared
that we're never gonna

36:34.061 --> 36:35.323
find a way to forgive him.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.760
Well, he's right.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.023
I'm not sure I ever will.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.852
This is about me
helping an old man

36:42.896 --> 36:45.028
get through
a rough time.

36:45.072 --> 36:48.641
Just because he stopped
being a father back then,

36:48.684 --> 36:51.252
doesn't mean that I got to
stop being a son right now.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.083
[exhales]

36:56.126 --> 37:00.087
All right, I-I got
a little time before my flight.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.970
That is some miracle
you pulled off, Luca.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.277
Hey, it wasn't me. You can
thank the priest I brought in.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.758
Oh, you had an actual priest
do an exorcism on the truck?

37:18.801 --> 37:22.109
LUCA:
No, not an exorcism. It
was more like a blessing.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.719
Deac gave me the name
of this guy. I got him

37:23.763 --> 37:26.113
to sprinkle some holy water
and say a few prayers,

37:26.156 --> 37:27.157
and now Xiomara's happy.

37:27.201 --> 37:28.158
How much did that
cost?

37:28.202 --> 37:29.595
Ah, just a
small donation,

37:29.638 --> 37:30.944
but whatever
it takes, man,

37:30.987 --> 37:32.772
I've been dreaming of
this my whole life.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.121
You've been dreaming
of owning

37:34.164 --> 37:35.949
a Guatemalan food truck
your whole life?

37:35.992 --> 37:38.952
No, dawg, I'm talking
metaphorically, wiseass.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.736
You know, when I was 16,
I worked the counter

37:40.780 --> 37:42.695
at this deli making
subs one summer.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.610
My dad started coming
in with his partner.

37:44.653 --> 37:46.699
Pretty soon, the whole
department stopped by for lunch.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.702
I got a reputation for being
generous with the cold cuts.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.312
Old man that owned the joint
even left me in charge

37:51.356 --> 37:52.966
for a week when
he went away.

37:53.009 --> 37:56.404
Man, I loved it. It was just,
like, everyone hanging out,

37:56.448 --> 37:58.972
shooting the breeze.
Me serving people.

37:59.015 --> 38:01.627
Now I get to do that
and be SWAT, so...

38:01.670 --> 38:03.977
This is cool, man.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.327
Can I still buy in?

38:06.371 --> 38:08.286
Sorry, bud, you
missed the boat.

38:08.329 --> 38:09.417
The shares
are all sold?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.941
Yeah, Lynch bought
the last one.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.814
Hey, is that the revuelta
with beans and cheese?Yeah.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.381
What did she put
in the sauce?

38:16.424 --> 38:17.817
Ah, it's a
trade secret.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.122
And that's gonna be $4.50.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.820
I thought you said
they were for free.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.125
No, that was earlier.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.388
Okay, we're running a
business, not a charity.

38:23.431 --> 38:24.606
Pay up.

38:24.650 --> 38:28.044
Go back there and
pay her. Go on.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.133
[both chuckling]

38:38.185 --> 38:40.230
How's he doing?Okay.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.407
Was talking about
making a run for it

38:42.450 --> 38:45.148
while you were gone,
but I convinced him to stay put.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.933
Best have bought me
something to eat.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.282
The food in here

38:48.326 --> 38:50.110
is godawful.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.112
Dad, you know, you can't
eat anything before surgery.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.288
That's another reason
I want out of here.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.943
And when did so many nurses
start being men?

38:56.986 --> 38:58.901
Least they
could do for

38:58.945 --> 39:01.382
an old dying fool
is give him some eye candy.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.470
[Brianna and Daniel chuckle]

39:02.514 --> 39:04.907
Some things never change.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.784
Thank you for coming back.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.311
You know...

39:18.399 --> 39:21.315
I'm a little scared
about all this.

39:25.798 --> 39:30.019
We know. That's why we're
all here for you, Pop.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.686
[overlapping chatter]

39:44.730 --> 39:45.687
Bye.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.864
Bye. Hey, thanks again, man.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.649
[sighs]

39:50.692 --> 39:52.259
The whole point
of an escape room

39:52.302 --> 39:54.392
is to figure out the clues,
not pick the lock.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.481
Hey, I got us out
of there, didn't I?

39:56.524 --> 39:58.570
With three seconds
left on the clock.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.094
We would've been
stuck there forever.

40:01.137 --> 40:04.619
No food, no water.
You know.

40:04.663 --> 40:05.838
Things would
turn ugly fast.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.317
Every man for himself.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.145
Well, someone really
likes to win, huh?

40:09.189 --> 40:11.234
Uh, is that not
the point of playing?

40:11.278 --> 40:13.628
Question, though:

40:13.672 --> 40:15.804
do you always carry
a lock pick wherever you go?

40:15.848 --> 40:18.894
I like to be prepared.Mm-hmm.

40:18.938 --> 40:21.506
Well, uh, this is me.

40:21.549 --> 40:24.422
Oh, wow.
It's a nice place.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.336
Yeah,
got a roof terrace.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.600
You can see the ocean.

40:28.643 --> 40:31.298
A glimpse at least.

40:31.341 --> 40:34.127
You want
to come up and see?

40:34.170 --> 40:37.652
Uh... I don't know.

40:37.696 --> 40:40.089
Ooh.No-no-no,

40:40.133 --> 40:42.352
it's-- hey.
It's not what you think.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.617
Molly, I like you.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.270
But?

40:47.314 --> 40:50.709
No buts. I just--
I like you.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.058
A lot.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.538
Okay, so?
[chuckles]

40:53.581 --> 40:58.281
In the past I've always--
I've treated things

40:58.325 --> 41:01.720
like a hundred-yard dash
as opposed to a marathon.

41:01.763 --> 41:05.375
You know? And things
have always...

41:05.419 --> 41:07.203
they've burned out
pretty quick.

41:07.247 --> 41:11.077
And I guess what I'm
saying kind of badly

41:11.120 --> 41:15.864
is, uh... I'd like to
take our time with this.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.261
How much time?

41:30.139 --> 41:32.272
A little longer
than that, maybe.

41:36.015 --> 41:37.625
That wasn't
really fair.

41:57.384 --> 41:58.864
Good night.

41:58.907 --> 42:01.083
[chuckles]

42:05.871 --> 42:07.133
[quietly]:
Yeah.
