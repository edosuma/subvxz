really odd

10:45.000 --> 10:47.583

people were upset about

10:47.583 --> 10:51.000

14:05.542 --> 14:09.583
Those were questions that I
couldn't answer at the time.

14:12.417 --> 14:15.041
I took on Jason Van
Dyke's case, um,

14:15.041 --> 14:17.041
really from the
early stages.

14:17.041 --> 14:20.166
It was just an
administrative case.

14:20.166 --> 14:25.208
After the shooting, the
video and the reports

14:25.208 --> 14:28.834
were reviewed by the top
command staff members

14:28.834 --> 14:34.041
and everybody, to a
man, concluded that

14:34.041 --> 14:37.709
this is a, um,
a proper shooting.

14:37.709 --> 14:40.750
It was essentially
approved.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.208
[Jamie] Once we knew officer
Jason Van Dyke's name,

14:58.208 --> 15:01.000
we were able to piece
together his record.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.750
By the time Van Dyke
shot Laquan McDonald,

15:08.750 --> 15:11.583
he had already been the target
of more than 20 allegations

15:11.583 --> 15:13.083
of misconduct.

15:16.417 --> 15:19.083
But in the course
of his 13-year career,

15:19.083 --> 15:21.875
he had never once
been disciplined.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.709
There was little reason to
believe the McDonald case

15:28.709 --> 15:30.792
would end any differently.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.041
The police said the
shooting was justified,

15:35.041 --> 15:38.667
and McDonald's family wasn't
speaking to the press.

15:40.625 --> 15:43.291
I was all-in on the story,

15:43.291 --> 15:46.250
but at that point, I had one
source with information

15:46.250 --> 15:48.750
about the dash cam video,

15:48.750 --> 15:50.959
unwilling to be publicly named

15:50.959 --> 15:54.667
because of concerns about
retaliation.

15:55.959 --> 15:59.333
So I asked a source if
she could find out about

15:59.333 --> 16:02.000

in her vehicle.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.667
She was visibly shaken.

a gunshot wound through the left
side of the front of the neck,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.667
which would be a serious
wound in that it

16:53.667 --> 16:55.333
went through the

The closest we have to Laquan
McDonald giving an account

17:14.375 --> 17:18.333
of what happened to him
is the autopsy.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.500
[Dr. Cina] Seven bullets were
recovered from the body,

17:20.500 --> 17:23.290
which means, uh, nine would've
passed through the body,

17:34.417 --> 17:36.166
impacted on the ground
near the body

17:36.166 --> 17:37.917
and could've caused some
shrapnel, which could've

17:37.917 --> 17:40.417
gotten up into the mouth.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.417
Given the other
things we knew,

17:42.417 --> 17:45.875
what the autopsy suggested
was the boy on the ground,

We had the street light, so
we were able to, you know,

19:38.125 --> 19:40.375
get a good view of
what was going on.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.583
There were a lot
of police officers.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.208

he was just trying to

from what was going on.

in and he dropped.

But that's when other
shots start coming in.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.542

I remember

20:23.250 --> 20:25.458
is, um, yelling,
"Stop shooting!

20:25.458 --> 20:27.792
He's dead already!"

"Why the fuck are they
still shooting him?

posing any type of threat.

27:09.375 --> 27:11.750
If somebody higher-up
would've seen this,

27:11.750 --> 27:13.959
they would've sent lawyers
to probate court trying

27:13.959 --> 27:16.083
to quash the subpoena.

27:16.834 --> 27:18.333
So whether that
person actually knew

27:18.333 --> 27:21.000
what he was sending?
I don't know.

27:22.750 --> 27:26.542
We popped it in in my computer
and we were shocked.

27:26.542 --> 27:28.542
[woman] ...a male we caught
breaking into church

27:28.542 --> 27:30.166
and stealing radios.

27:30.166 --> 27:32.458
And what we saw was,
in our opinion, uh,

27:32.458 --> 27:35.083
a first-degree murder

27:35.083 --> 27:37.792
♪dramatic

27:37.792 --> 27:39.667
This video was accessible
and reviewed

27:39.667 --> 27:41.000
by the police the night
of the shooting,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.291
so how do you
justify this?

27:43.291 --> 27:45.291
You come up with a
bunch of excuses,

27:45.291 --> 27:47.625
a bunch of lies about
a young man,

27:47.625 --> 27:49.542
waving the knife
aggressively,

27:49.542 --> 27:52.041
threatening us.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.166
We know from emails
that have been released

27:57.166 --> 28:00.583
that they were on the lookout
for somebody calling about

28:00.583 --> 28:04.000
the Laquan McDonald case.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.041
And when we finally did
reach out to the city,

28:08.041 --> 28:12.333
they knew exactly what
case we were talking about.

28:12.667 --> 28:16.000
We told them, "We've
got the video."

28:16.000 --> 28:18.166
And there was just stunned
silence on the other

28:18.166 --> 28:22.333
end of the phone that said
"How'd you get the video?"

28:22.333 --> 28:26.709
♪bagpipes

28:34.000 --> 28:38.542
At that point, the machinery
was, in some sense, working.

28:38.542 --> 28:41.417
But the pressure is building.

28:42.250 --> 28:46.959
It starts with the autopsy
impeaching the police narrative.

28:48.166 --> 28:52.041
It includes the civilian
witnesses.

28:52.875 --> 28:56.041
And finally, somewhat
improbably,

28:56.041 --> 29:00.875
the video is sent to the
lawyers for the family.

29:02.041 --> 29:07.834
At the same time, the national
context keeps intensifying.

29:07.834 --> 29:12.417
The shooting of Michael
Brown in Ferguson,

29:12.417 --> 29:16.375
Eric Garner in New York,

29:16.375 --> 29:18.333
Freddie Gray in Baltimore.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.166
[man] Protests growing
nationwide,

29:20.166 --> 29:23.500
from Oakland, California,
Philadelphia, Atlanta,

29:23.500 --> 29:25.709
and Washington D.C.

29:27.291 --> 29:30.458
[Jamie] And, in response to
the popular protests,

29:30.458 --> 29:34.625
we have an increasingly active
Justice Department

29:34.625 --> 29:36.125
intervening.

29:36.125 --> 29:38.750
[man] The Justice Department
has opened investigations

29:38.750 --> 29:40.959
or is enforcing
court-ordered changes

29:40.959 --> 29:44.000
in 32 police departments
and sheriff's offices

29:44.000 --> 29:46.166
in 18 states.

29:51.208 --> 29:55.291
[applause]

29:55.959 --> 29:58.000
[Jeff] The hope was that
the public outcry about

29:58.000 --> 30:01.166
the Laquan McDonald case
would finally bring

30:01.166 --> 30:04.333
the Department of Justice to
intervene in Chicago.

30:12.625 --> 30:14.500
I came to the Department
of Justice

30:14.500 --> 30:16.959
in the kind of
Golden Era, um,

30:16.959 --> 30:20.750
and I worked with a really
amazing group of people

30:20.750 --> 30:23.750
I investigated departments
ranging from New Orleans

30:23.750 --> 30:27.000
to Ferguson to
Newark, New Jersey.

30:31.542 --> 30:34.375
In Chicago, we opened
the formal investigation

30:34.375 --> 30:37.375
after Laquan McDonald
was killed.

30:43.583 --> 30:46.208
Chicago was the largest team
we've ever had,

30:46.208 --> 30:50.208
and we reviewed over 400
Use of Force investigations,

30:50.208 --> 30:52.834
and that included 170
investigations

30:52.834 --> 30:55.208
of officer-involved
shootings.

30:56.959 --> 31:00.500
There's never been the
kind of wholesale change

31:00.500 --> 31:03.000
and reform needed
from within Chicago,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.041
where you really have
such strong local politics

31:05.041 --> 31:08.166
and such a strong
police department.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.875
What we are looking at when we
do one of these investigations?

31:11.875 --> 31:14.500
"Is this behavior aberrational?
Or is it part of a normal

31:14.500 --> 31:16.375
pattern or practice?"

31:20.917 --> 31:23.417
In Chicago, the
police officers

31:23.417 --> 31:25.625
still control the
scene of a shooting

31:25.625 --> 31:29.083
and still conduct the
initial questioning.

31:31.792 --> 31:35.000
Officers were not separated
before they gave statements.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.417
Um, officers were allowed to
speak to their union reps.

31:38.417 --> 31:40.291
They don't prohibit
officers, in any way,

31:40.291 --> 31:43.000
from cooking
their stories.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.667
The FOP responded to

31:50.667 --> 31:52.875
the Laquan McDonald
shooting as they respond

31:52.875 --> 31:55.250
to all police-involved
shootings.

31:55.250 --> 31:57.250
So what we try to do
is give the officers

31:57.250 --> 31:59.750
the benefit of the doubt
and allow them

31:59.750 --> 32:02.959
to de-escalate,
more or less.

32:02.959 --> 32:05.583
And -- And to get
some time away,

32:05.583 --> 32:08.041
collect your thoughts,
meet with counsel,

32:08.041 --> 32:11.291
and then go forward and
make their statement.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.125
Morning after,
I get a phone call.

32:18.125 --> 32:20.542
I ask them, "How
is everything?

32:20.542 --> 32:22.291
Is everybody okay?"

32:22.291 --> 32:24.583
"Everybody's okay."
"Is it a good shoot?"

32:24.583 --> 32:26.208
"It's a good shoot."

32:26.208 --> 32:28.291
We're done.

32:32.458 --> 32:36.834
[Christy] They ask officers
to risk their careers

32:36.834 --> 32:39.041
when they get them all
in a room together and say,

32:39.041 --> 32:43.333
"Hey, let's all make sure we
have our stories straight."

32:43.333 --> 32:46.333
[Dean] We've got a pretty
good batting average.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.125
We would be the highest-paid
player in that league,

32:49.125 --> 32:55.166
if it was salary, it was
based on, uh, on wins.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.667
[Cristy] There were a lot
of issues we found

33:03.667 --> 33:08.000
with officer statements in
the Laquan McDonald case.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.750
There's a saying in
police work.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.709
There's a saying in
crisis management

33:11.709 --> 33:13.625
that the first three
reports from the scene

33:13.625 --> 33:15.500
are generally wrong.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.333
Did you know that?

33:17.333 --> 33:19.542
It is absolutely the
case that there may be

33:19.542 --> 33:22.166
different interpretations
or different...

33:22.166 --> 33:24.458
...parts of a scenario were
remembered differently

33:24.458 --> 33:26.291
by different people.

33:26.291 --> 33:30.333
The problem is that not only
are all of these narratives

33:30.333 --> 33:32.291
remarkably similar to each
other but they're all

33:32.291 --> 33:35.333
inconsistent with the evidence
in the exact same ways.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.959
You could weave whatever
thread you want through this.

33:37.959 --> 33:41.041
You could say that Lee Harvey
Oswald was involved.

33:41.041 --> 33:44.208
But he wasn't here.

33:44.208 --> 33:47.750
The Laquan McDonald case
was not a cover-up.

33:50.333 --> 33:53.333
[Jamie] The officers say that
they saw the victim lunge.

33:53.333 --> 33:56.709
Other officers say that Laquan
McDonald was behaving

33:56.709 --> 33:59.542
in a threatening manner.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.417
They lied. They lied
from day one.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.667
They lied about something of

34:05.667 --> 34:08.208
fundamental human importance.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.833
[bell ringing]

34:11.750 --> 34:14.667
[Dan] There are certain things
that were put in the reports

34:14.667 --> 34:18.166
that may not appear in
all the evidence.

34:18.625 --> 34:20.958
I would certainly
acknowledge that.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.166
There's always an effort to,
you know, make the case

34:23.166 --> 34:27.250
as good as it can be
going forward to trial.

34:27.250 --> 34:30.208
And I know that the
reports were drafted

34:30.208 --> 34:34.000
and reviewed by the
command staff.

34:35.833 --> 34:38.833
It was really the pattern
and practice of --

34:38.833 --> 34:41.917
of the police department.

34:41.917 --> 34:45.166
♪eerie
music♪

34:46.458 --> 34:49.458
The investigation
involved, arguably,

34:49.458 --> 34:51.875
the destruction of
evidence as in the --

34:51.875 --> 34:54.792
the case of the Burger King,
the falsification of reports

34:54.792 --> 34:56.875
by multiple officers,

34:56.875 --> 34:59.458
the intimidation
of witnesses,

34:59.458 --> 35:03.834
and the falsification
of their stories.

35:05.417 --> 35:10.625
And then, the findings go to
the State's Attorney's office.

35:14.625 --> 35:17.041
Being, uh, Cook County
State's Attorney,

35:17.041 --> 35:19.250
this is the second-largest
office in the nation,

35:19.250 --> 35:22.500
so it's -- it's quite
a -- a big job.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.000
The number one goal for
a State's Attorney,

35:25.000 --> 35:28.166
as a prosecutor, either here or
anywhere in the country,

35:28.166 --> 35:30.834
is public safety.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.166
It's not easy.

35:32.166 --> 35:34.583
Right now, police
are under attack

35:34.583 --> 35:36.500
and I think right now,

35:36.500 --> 35:39.458
probably the most difficult
job you can have

35:39.458 --> 35:41.834
is to be a police officer.

35:41.834 --> 35:45.333
And so, police officer shootings
have to be handled differently,

35:45.333 --> 35:47.166
because they're
police officers

35:47.166 --> 35:49.500
and it's not the same
as one gangbanger

35:49.500 --> 35:53.166
shooting another.
It'll never be.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.166
Here's the other reality:

35:55.166 --> 35:57.667
It's extremely hard to
convict police officers.

35:57.667 --> 36:01.125
And if you look at the
results across the nation,

36:01.125 --> 36:05.500
it -- it's rare that
we're successful.

36:07.917 --> 36:09.667
[woman] When did you
see the video?

it happened,

36:12.041 --> 36:14.917
back in November
of 2014.

36:18.333 --> 36:21.208
[woman] And when did
the mayor see it?

36:24.375 --> 36:27.709
[Anita] I would guess he
saw it before I did.

36:33.375 --> 36:37.959
[buzzing and
indistinct chatter]

36:37.959 --> 36:40.166
[Will] Are you a registered
voter in this neighborhood?

36:40.166 --> 36:41.208
All right, have a
blessed day.

36:41.208 --> 36:42.417
What about you,
brother?

36:42.417 --> 36:45.208
-Not this neighborhood, sir.
-Oh, okay.

36:45.208 --> 36:47.709
[bell ringing]

36:56.917 --> 36:59.208
With Laquan, it just
seemed like

36:59.208 --> 37:02.583
here's another black
youth shot

37:02.583 --> 37:06.417
by Chicago Police
Department. No justice.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.834
Yeah, you can sign
right here.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.750
Thank you so much.

37:13.750 --> 37:18.208
But when Jamie Kelven came
out with his investigation,

37:18.208 --> 37:21.417
I found out that the
video existed.

37:21.417 --> 37:23.375
For so long, across
the nation,

37:23.375 --> 37:25.375
we never had video evidence,
you know what I mean?

37:25.375 --> 37:28.208
Like, with Trayvon Martin,
with Mike Brown,

37:28.208 --> 37:31.667
we never had real
video evidence.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.959
But now, here we are.

37:33.959 --> 37:36.458
Video evidence.

37:36.458 --> 37:38.750
And so I just got to
researching about

37:38.750 --> 37:42.917
how to get information released
from the police department.

37:43.583 --> 37:47.875
I had a-- a friend, he
told me about FOIA.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.125
And I didn't know
at the time,

37:49.125 --> 37:51.083
I wasn't educated on
what FOIA was,

37:51.083 --> 37:52.959
the Freedom of
Information Act.

37:52.959 --> 37:55.625
We FOIA'd for
the tape, right?

37:56.375 --> 38:00.208
Of course, the Chicago Police
Department denied us,

38:00.208 --> 38:05.458
and we filed a lawsuit,
and we hired a attorney.

38:06.458 --> 38:10.375
Part of the police
department's and city's

38:10.375 --> 38:14.458
strategy and success in
maintaining a system

38:14.458 --> 38:18.000
of impunity involves
official secrecy.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.125
The standard operating procedure
of keeping things secret was

38:22.125 --> 38:24.041
"It's under investigation."

38:24.041 --> 38:26.959
The three words "It's
under investigation"

38:26.959 --> 38:28.583
just end all inquiry.

38:28.583 --> 38:30.542
It's like --

38:30.542 --> 38:33.417
It was like running
into a brick wall.

38:37.083 --> 38:40.500
I don't -- I don't really
have an opposition

38:40.500 --> 38:43.709
to the video
being released.

38:43.709 --> 38:46.291
My concern is
I don't want

38:46.291 --> 38:49.458
the case to somehow
be jeopardized.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.500
I think if you ask
any prosecutor,

38:51.500 --> 38:53.959
we don't like when
all of our evidence

38:53.959 --> 38:55.667
is out there.

38:56.709 --> 39:01.500
So, the city and the
prosecutors, um --

39:01.500 --> 39:05.166
they knew the facts
of this case, um --

39:05.166 --> 39:08.125
from a very
early-on stage.

39:08.125 --> 39:10.583
They knew the contents
of the video.

39:10.583 --> 39:15.875
But we had a political
storm that was brewing.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.417
President Obama's former
Chief of Staff,

39:19.417 --> 39:21.583
current-Mayor Rahm Emanuel,

39:21.583 --> 39:24.041
is in a race against Cook
County Commissioner

39:24.041 --> 39:25.875
Jesus "Chewy" Garcia.

39:25.875 --> 39:28.208
[man] That Emanuel
even has a competitor

39:28.208 --> 39:31.625
is a stunning setback, but his
failure to win a majority

39:31.625 --> 39:35.667
in the February election
forced him into a run-off.

39:36.625 --> 39:40.750
[Jeff] The run-off election was
absolutely a factor in

39:40.750 --> 39:44.166
the city's suppression
of this tape.

39:44.166 --> 39:46.375
I was -- I was ready
to, you know,

39:46.375 --> 39:48.250
"Fuck the city. Let's
file this lawsuit.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.542
Let's release this video."

39:50.542 --> 39:53.041
But then the city called
us back and said,

39:53.041 --> 39:55.250
"We want to discuss
settling it."

39:55.250 --> 39:57.917
And so we had many
meetings with

39:57.917 --> 40:01.834
Laquan's family about what was
the best way to proceed.

40:02.583 --> 40:05.542
And that was something
we agonized about.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.500
The family, of course, has
lost someone,

40:07.500 --> 40:10.125

[laughs] Charge him
with murder?

01:05:27.709 --> 01:05:30.792
What are you
talking about?

01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:35.208
We can jump back to
Baltimore, Freddie Gray,

01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:37.875
Ferguson...

01:05:39.291 --> 01:05:42.792
...Eric Garner
in New York.

01:05:43.959 --> 01:05:46.291
How many people
were convicted?

01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:48.792
The grand jury has just
decided not to indict

01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:52.500
a New York City police officer
over the death of Eric Garner.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.917
All six Baltimore
police officers

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.250
charged in the death
of Freddie Gray

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.709
have been cleared.

01:05:57.709 --> 01:06:01.166
There is going to be
no indictment.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:06.709
I'm reminded of Rodney King.

01:06:08.166 --> 01:06:10.959
What the country needs
to look at is

01:06:10.959 --> 01:06:13.709
how it plays out
in court.

01:06:16.834 --> 01:06:18.959
[Dan] Am I gonna
win this case?

01:06:18.959 --> 01:06:21.125

Make a hole!

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:23.625
I will tell you after
I pick the jury

01:06:23.625 --> 01:06:26.083
what my odds are.

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:44.667
[Will] It was a tense time.
It was a tense time

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.208
while we was
waiting.

01:06:48.709 --> 01:06:53.250

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:09.208
So was I nervous?
Yeah, I was nervous.

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.542
We want justice for all
the names and every --

01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:16.166
every life that was taken by
Chicago Police Department.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:18.750
This corruption runs deep.
It runs deep.

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.542
It'll be four years since
Laquan's been shot, man.

01:07:21.542 --> 01:07:24.041
And we still haven't
got any type of justice

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.375
for Laquan McDonald.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.917
And I'm not gonna stop
until we get justice.

-16 shots and a cover-up!
-[crowd] What?

01:07:39.834 --> 01:07:43.208
Laquan McDonald was
shot 16 times

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:46.709
by police officer Jason
Van Dyke, and he died.

01:07:46.709 --> 01:07:48.041
That -- That happened.

01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:51.417
Was he murdered?
Or was he killed?

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:55.083
Did a child die?
Or did a suspect die?

01:07:55.083 --> 01:07:56.750
All of those things
are dependent

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.792

[Charlene] I braced myself
for a "not guilty" verdict.

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:18.125
I didn't even think
about the possibility

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:20.291

[Will] We did a rally here
the day before the trial.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:30.417
One of the reporters had
pulled me to the side.

01:08:30.417 --> 01:08:33.291
"I want to ask you something

from City Hall,

and a bombshell announcement
from Mayor Rahm Emanuel

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:46.917
during a news conference
just moments ago.

01:08:46.917 --> 01:08:48.792

I have decided not
to seek re-election.

01:08:54.332 --> 01:08:56.332
The announcement from
Mayor Rahm Emanuel

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.166
that caught most of
Chicago off-guard.

01:08:58.166 --> 01:08:59.667
Sources close to the
Mayor said they were

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:03.332
95% sure he would
run for re-election.

01:09:03.332 --> 01:09:05.166

01:09:17.792 --> 01:09:20.500
I mean, that's heavy.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.417

of Jason Van Dyke.

[woman] Van Dyke is charged
with first-degree murder

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:30.250

he shot McDonald.

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:38.709

euphoric mood on the street.

01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:42.332

of Chicago police
officer Jason Van Dyke.

01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:55.458
That first day, you could feel
the tension in the room.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:59.375
I just wanted to be there,
um -- as a means of support

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:02.000
and to demonstrate to
the officers out there

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.375
in the vehicles
that somebody is

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.834
standing with this kid.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.208
[Will] It was intense.
You had one side that was

01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:14.625
Laquan's family, community
members, and supporters.

01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:17.250
And then, you had another
side, which was

01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:19.625
Jason Van Dyke's family

01:10:19.625 --> 01:10:22.917

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.333
It's literally a stage.

01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:35.750
The jury is a kind of
silent Greek chorus.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.792
[Charlene] You knew
it made history.

01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:39.750
For a Chicago police
to be on trial

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.750
in the first place for
murder, number one.

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:45.542
And for murdering a black
person, number two.

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:49.208
I was like, "Okay, how are they
gonna perceive me?"

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:51.583
Since I was the
only black.

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:53.250

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.667
They introduce you to
the defense team,

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:57.458
and the prosecution
team,

01:10:57.458 --> 01:11:00.500
and you're going, "Wow,
this is for real."

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.041
But it doesn't --
It didn't feel real.

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:04.125
It felt surreal.
So many times,

01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:07.625

heard a pin drop.

deafening.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:37.208
The story in this case

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:40.291
is a story written,

01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:45.166
directed, and orchestrated
by one person:

01:11:45.166 --> 01:11:47.500
Laquan McDonald.

01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:50.417
Think about it like
a horror movie.

01:11:50.417 --> 01:11:54.041
You see the villain walking
down the street.

01:11:54.041 --> 01:11:56.291
Not very fearful, but when
he stops and he turns

01:11:56.291 --> 01:12:00.291
and makes eye contact
with the victim,

01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:02.500
then that's when the
music starts to play.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.667
Well, that's what
happened here.

01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:06.667
We filed a motion,
and actually,

01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:10.041
that motion was granted,
that the prosecution

01:12:10.041 --> 01:12:13.333
cannot refer to Laquan
McDonald as a "victim."

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:15.834
Laquan McDonald was,
uh, was an offender

01:12:15.834 --> 01:12:19.709
in this case and was
a dangerous person.

01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:23.500
Laquan McDonald goes over to
him...and attempts to stab.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.208
I remember that Laquan
was in and out of

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:29.375

um --

01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:32.000

with the law.

it that way.

raising serious
questions and --

01:13:06.542 --> 01:13:10.125
and hoping that maybe some
of the jurors would think,

01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:12.625
"You know, this kid
was so rotten and bad,

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:15.250

about ready to, uh,

be there.

and is walking behind
Laquan McDonald.

01:15:31.917 --> 01:15:33.875
There's nobody else
around, they're not

01:15:33.875 --> 01:15:37.417
protecting anybody
from him.

01:15:37.417 --> 01:15:40.000
There's certainly no evidence
of anything combative

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.375
on the part of
Laquan McDonald,

01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:44.750
but nor is there anything
provocative about

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.834
the behavior of
the officers.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.792
[Kim] Did he threaten
you with the knife?

01:15:48.792 --> 01:15:51.583
[McElligott] No.
Uh, we walked...

01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:55.208
...all the way to
the car lot.

01:15:55.208 --> 01:15:57.458
[Jamie] In fact,
these officers are

01:15:57.458 --> 01:16:00.959
accompanying Laquan
McDonald towards his death.

01:16:00.959 --> 01:16:05.083
They don't know it.
He doesn't know it.

01:16:07.583 --> 01:16:08.917
Moments later,

01:16:08.917 --> 01:16:10.709
Van Dyke gets
out of his car,

01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:14.792
and within a matter of
seconds, has shot the boy.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.208
They're standing there
witnessing

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:21.667
a gratuitous atrocity.

01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:29.792
[Kim] Why didn't you
fire your weapon?

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:37.291
Um... He didn't make any
direct movement at me,

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:40.625
and I felt like my partner
was protected,

01:16:40.625 --> 01:16:44.792
for the most part,
inside the vehicle.

01:16:51.792 --> 01:16:54.959
I mean, you're the police.

01:16:54.959 --> 01:16:59.083
In my day, that kid
never gets to Pulaski.

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:01.417
Never. You know?

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:04.792
You take him,
somehow,

01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:07.500
when he's leaving
that truck yard.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.750
He never gets
that far.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.667
[woman] So if McElligott
had done his job,

01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:14.417
none of this would
have happened?

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:16.834
You know, what McElligott
does or doesn't do

01:17:16.834 --> 01:17:19.542
turns into what we
have on Pulaski.

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:22.375
They look at
them as a rat.

01:17:22.375 --> 01:17:25.625
Or traitors, you know?

01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:28.625
For not maintaining this
Blue Code of Silence

01:17:28.625 --> 01:17:31.959
inside the Chicago
Police Department.

01:17:31.959 --> 01:17:33.458
[woman] Were you surprised
to see officers

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:36.166
breaking rank
to testify?

01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:39.333
Yeah, I was.

01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:41.834
I was shocked.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.375
♪sparse
synth♪

01:17:49.792 --> 01:17:51.375
[woman] The trial of
a white police officer

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:53.000
charged with murdering
a black teenager

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.834
-resumes today.
-Of course, there are a lot

01:17:54.834 --> 01:17:56.875
a lot of crucial decisions
that need to be made,

01:17:56.875 --> 01:17:59.709
including whether Jason
Van Dyke will testify

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:02.208
-on his own behalf.
-The defense still has not said

01:18:02.208 --> 01:18:04.375
whether Van Dyke himself
will take the stand.

01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:07.291
[woman] Jason Van Dyke, taking
the stand in his own defense.

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:10.458
It doesn't happen
very often.

01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:12.875
[Dan] I mean, I was
a prosecutor.

01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:15.625
You know, I recognize
the significance of

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:19.667
a defendant taking
a witness stand.

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:21.792
But we knew, at that
point in time,

01:18:21.792 --> 01:18:24.333
that jury had to hear
from Jason Van Dyke.

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:26.834
And Jason Van Dyke
had to convince them

01:18:26.834 --> 01:18:30.208
that he was not guilty of
first-degree murder.

01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:34.417
Right before Jason
testified, I literally

01:18:34.417 --> 01:18:37.083
sweat through my shirt,

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:40.583
because I was so nervous
about his testimony.

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:45.291
Jason Van Dyke.
V-A-N D-Y-K-E.

01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:46.875
[Dan] How old
are you, Jason?

01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:49.458
I'm 40 years old.

01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:53.542
[Dean] We were staring
at each other.

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:55.125
He told me, he
says, "You know,

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:58.125
I was watching you, looking at
you when I was testifying."

01:18:58.125 --> 01:18:59.583
Which kind of
gave me the...

01:18:59.583 --> 01:19:00.709
I knew he was,

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:02.583
but he didn't
have to tell me.

01:19:02.583 --> 01:19:03.917
You know, we were
making eye contact

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:06.041
and he was
trying to relax.

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:07.583
[Dan] Did you see Laquan
McDonald when you got

01:19:07.583 --> 01:19:09.083
-out of the car?
-Yes.

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:11.917
[Dan] And could you
see him? His face?

01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:15.000
His face had
no expression.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.583
His eyes were just bugging
out of his head.

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:20.542
He had just these huge...

01:19:20.542 --> 01:19:24.792
...wide eyes just staring
right through me.

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:28.041
He turned his torso
towards me.

01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:32.083
[Dan] And what, if anything,
did he do with his arm?

01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:37.291
He waved the knife from his
lower right side upwards,

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:41.875
across his body towards
my left shoulder.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:47.458
[Dan] And when he did that,
what did you do, officer?

01:19:47.458 --> 01:19:49.500
I shot him.

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:56.792
[Will] It's crocodile tears.

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:01.166
For me, it was like
the audacity...

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:03.834
...for you to get up there
and act like you a victim.

01:20:03.834 --> 01:20:06.291
For you to act like you the
victim out of all of this,

01:20:06.291 --> 01:20:08.208
the audacity.

01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:10.667
You murdered this
young man.

01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:12.375
In cold blood.

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:15.667
And you have no remorse.
He has no remorse.

01:20:15.667 --> 01:20:17.458
I felt bad for him,
you know?

01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:19.583
I felt, uh, I could see
him breaking up,

01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:22.166
because he got confused
a little bit.

01:20:22.166 --> 01:20:23.667
[woman] During those six
seconds, you're getting

01:20:23.667 --> 01:20:27.041
closer to him,
correct?

01:20:27.041 --> 01:20:28.834
I now know that, yeah.
I -- I took a couple

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:31.333
steps towards
him, yeah.

01:20:31.333 --> 01:20:33.375
[woman] Well, you took
more than a couple steps,

01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:35.208
because you go all
the way up past

01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:37.834
your squad car,
correct?

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:41.208
The end of your
squad car?

01:20:41.208 --> 01:20:42.959
I'm not sure.

01:20:42.959 --> 01:20:45.458
I just killed somebody.

01:20:45.458 --> 01:20:49.959
I'm from a suburb
outside Chicago

01:20:49.959 --> 01:20:54.208
in a very non-diverse
environment I grew up in.

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:57.625
And I come into
the middle of

01:20:57.625 --> 01:20:59.709
the most violent city
in one of the most

01:20:59.709 --> 01:21:03.041
violent neighborhoods,
and you're telling me

01:21:03.041 --> 01:21:05.500
I should've realized
I stepped

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.250
forward or backward?

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:10.250
I could see...
[sighs]

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:13.875
You know, I could
s-- [sighs]

01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:15.500
[exhales deeply]

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.458
[clears throat]

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:23.041
I could see him starting to
push up with his left hand

01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:26.041
off the ground.

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:28.417
And I see his left shoulder
start to come up,

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:30.625
and I still see him holding
that -- that knife

01:21:30.625 --> 01:21:35.083
with his right hand,
not letting go of it.

01:21:35.083 --> 01:21:37.041
And his eyes are
still bugged out,

01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:40.750
his face has got no
expression on it.

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.250
[sniffs]

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:46.750
What was so palpable with
Jason Van Dyke was the --

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:48.875
the reality of his fear.

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:51.917
All he kind of had to
stand on was his --

01:21:51.917 --> 01:21:53.667
was his fear.

01:21:53.667 --> 01:21:57.417
All he could coherently say
about what happened that night

01:21:57.417 --> 01:22:01.250
was that he was terrified.

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:04.375
[woman] Four years
after the shooting,

01:22:04.375 --> 01:22:06.500
the trial and case
have taken on

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.458
huge importance
in Chicago.

01:22:08.458 --> 01:22:10.625
[man] One of the most
closely-watched trials

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.250
in the city's history.

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.291
[man] The trial of a generation
threatens to set

01:22:14.291 --> 01:22:16.625
a match to a
racial tinderbox.

01:22:16.625 --> 01:22:18.458
[woman] Now, everyone who's
watching this testimony

01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:21.250
kind of sees all this evidence
through their own lens,

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:23.542
but really, what's going to
matter is how the jurors

01:22:23.542 --> 01:22:27.291
are viewing this evidence.

01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:30.834
[Jamie] There's never been,
at least in my awareness,

01:22:30.834 --> 01:22:35.625
a case about which, in one
sense, we knew so much.

01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:38.792
But all of those
facts are in

01:22:38.792 --> 01:22:42.917
tension and competition
with another story

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:45.500
that is extraordinarily
strong,

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.166
seeps up from the groundwater
in our society,

01:22:49.166 --> 01:22:53.333
and is based less on
evidence than on fear.

01:22:53.333 --> 01:22:55.959
Remember? We talked
about this in opening.

01:22:55.959 --> 01:22:57.750
I said, "Think about
a monster movie."

01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.750
When they're walking
down the street,

01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:02.583
and let's say there's...
the -- the victim is

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:04.583
hiding in the bush,
you know,

01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:06.166
there's not much
danger here.

01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:08.500
But when that monster
suddenly stops and turns

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:12.166
and looks right at that --
that victim in the bush,

01:23:12.166 --> 01:23:14.834
I -- I think I said that's
when the music starts to play.

01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:16.125
That's when --

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:18.375
That's when the filmmakers
are like, "Okay,

01:23:18.375 --> 01:23:20.333
I got him right now."
We knew that we would

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:22.959
never convince
all the jurors.

01:23:22.959 --> 01:23:26.166
Our plan was to
strike up a rapport

01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:29.041
with several jurors that
could create a hung jury.

01:23:29.041 --> 01:23:31.750
First-degree murder.

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:34.542
It's unprecedented.

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:38.458
It's unprecedented
for a police officer,

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:41.542
first-degree murder?

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:45.208
So I'm gonna
ask ya,

01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:49.208
when you go back
to the jury room,

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:51.625
you owe it
to yourself

01:23:51.625 --> 01:23:55.208
to make the right
decision here.

01:23:55.208 --> 01:23:56.792
We also owe it to
our -- to our city,

01:23:56.792 --> 01:24:01.000
our county,
our country.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.500
You have a very
important job here.

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:07.250
I was convinced by
the defense,

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:10.875
yes, Jason thought
his life was being --

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:13.792
was being endangered
so he shot.

01:24:13.792 --> 01:24:17.583
The jury believed that he
feared for his life.

01:24:24.417 --> 01:24:26.792
[woman] Everyone is
waiting for the verdict,

01:24:26.792 --> 01:24:28.458
and right now, jurors are
deciding the fate

01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:30.375
-of Jason Van Dyke.
-Police ramping up

01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:32.417
for the Jason Van Dyke
verdict. It could come

01:24:32.417 --> 01:24:34.583
-any day now
-Chicago is on high alert

01:24:34.583 --> 01:24:36.417
this morning, bracing
for the possibility

01:24:36.417 --> 01:24:39.792
of mass protest and
demonstrations.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.250
Okay. We're ready.

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:50.250
Jason Van Dyke needs to go to
jail. He is a murderer.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:54.291
That is a high hill to climb
because at this point,

01:24:54.291 --> 01:24:57.417
nothing has ever happened to a
Chicago police officer

01:24:57.417 --> 01:25:00.458
for anything that they've done
to an African-American person.

01:25:00.458 --> 01:25:04.875
The family wanted to
officially say on-record

01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:06.875
that we are
people of faith.

01:25:06.875 --> 01:25:08.375
I went in there with faith,

01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:11.250
but I went in there angry,
wanting something to happen.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:14.291
We are conscious that
Laquan McDonald represents

01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:17.375
all of the victims of,
uh -- police violence
