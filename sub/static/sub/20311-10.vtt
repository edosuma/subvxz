WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:04.964
Here we go.
This time for sure. Ready?

00:04.964 --> 00:08.843
[Gerry laughs] Oh.

00:09.844 --> 00:13.848
Here we go.
[laughs]

00:17.476 --> 00:20.312
Oh! Oh.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.022
Oh! Stop.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.027
Oh!

00:27.027 --> 00:29.363
-Hey, Mr. Duncan?
-What?

00:29.363 --> 00:32.032
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
realize you were teaching.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.744
Yeah, I'm in the middle of this.
Please. Thank you.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.624
Ah, ah! Now,
if I make it to the desk,

00:40.624 --> 00:44.670
I win a million dollars.
Look!

00:45.713 --> 00:47.214
You watching?

00:47.214 --> 00:50.801
If I get to the desk,
I win a million dollars.

00:50.801 --> 00:55.389
Millionaire! Ohhhh!

00:56.598 --> 00:59.601
We did it, kids.

00:59.601 --> 01:04.314
Whoo! We did it!

01:21.832 --> 01:23.417
-Hey, Jeff.
-Gerry.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.084
-Gerry, Jeff.
-Robert.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.588
-How's phys-ed?
-Great. Really good.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.757
Yeah? Kids still
think we're the same?

01:29.757 --> 01:31.592
-You're still doing
that thing, huh?
-It's not a thing.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.760
Do you not see the resemblance?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.344
-Between he and I? Yeah.
-Between?

01:34.344 --> 01:36.513
-We're in a dopplegang.
-What? You're not in a gang.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.140
-You don't even fight.
-Gerry, Jeff and I will

01:39.140 --> 01:42.019
be covering for you in your
last class today while you're
away on the field trip.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.229
So, I hope the kids
have lots of work to do.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.523
They have lots of work
and make sure they do it

01:46.523 --> 01:48.025
because there's
a test coming up.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.193
I will, gives me time to
work on my newsletters.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.987
Yeah.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.240
And you make sure
they don't confuse you and I.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.410
Tell them I'm away,
tell them your name.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.828
Tell them
I'm on a field trip.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.872
Oh, because we
look so much alike.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.458
Hey, Gerry. You excited
for your field trip?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.627
-I'm Jeff! That's Gerry.
-Jeff!

02:06.627 --> 02:08.712
-Hello? Lisa.
-Easy mistake to make.

02:08.712 --> 02:12.091
-Right here.
-Wow. You guys look
so alike.

02:12.091 --> 02:15.010
-Yeah. Uncanny.
-Wow. Uncanny.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.178
Every time. It's like,
people are confused.

02:17.178 --> 02:20.474
Do you see what I'm
talking about? Told you.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.267
Tried to tell him that,
he doesn't see it.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.937
[sighs] Oh.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.856
-Bobbi, are you all right?
-Yeah, it's just a bit
of a sore back.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.483
You're going to be on the bus,
right, in five minutes?

02:29.483 --> 02:32.569
-Yeah, OK. Relax.
-Just say it.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.904
Five minutes, you need me
on the bus.

02:33.904 --> 02:37.825
Easy. Five minutes.

02:37.825 --> 02:41.202
I love field trips.
Eight hour spare today.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.999
She's supervising it.
I just show up. Ratio,

02:44.999 --> 02:47.542
-I'm for the ratio.
-I think actually,

02:47.542 --> 02:49.044
there's a few things
you have to do.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.587
They have to learn stuff.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.422
No, they're nothing
to learn on a field trip.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.757
It's just a day off.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.550
Take care of the kids.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.429
Tour guides do that.
It's a party day.

03:02.141 --> 03:05.144
Good morning, Trudy.
These are for you.

03:05.144 --> 03:08.730
-Good morning to you too.
-I have to get to work on
my vice principal's message

03:08.730 --> 03:11.650
-for the newsletter.
-How are you ever going
to top last year's opus?

03:11.650 --> 03:15.154
It'll be tough, but
that's why I've carved out
the entire day in my schedule.

03:15.154 --> 03:18.323
-So, please, no interruptions.
-Fine.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.576
Oh, and Trudy, I'm going
to need that paperwork
turned around PDQ,

03:21.576 --> 03:24.663
so if I could have it by EOD,
that would be OK.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.290
-OK.
-Stay late if you have to.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.209
-GFY, Robert.
-Sorry?

03:30.209 --> 03:34.048
-Have a nice day.
-Wouldn't that be HAND?

03:34.048 --> 03:37.092
-Oh, yeah! HAND.
-HAND, handy.

03:37.092 --> 03:41.638
-Have a nice day you.
-AH.

03:41.638 --> 03:46.267
Let's go, let's go, let's move
it. Big trip today, guys.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.311
-Let's get on the bus.
-Hey, sir.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.855
Hey, Cassandra.
Hey, Gupreet.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.106
-Hey, sir.
-All right.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.107
Potato?

03:52.107 --> 03:53.817
Who gave ya that, Jonah?

03:53.817 --> 03:55.402
father does it with me.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.278
Tell your dad that Mr. D
invented that.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.074
-No, you didn't.
-Yeah and you're
missing the best part:

04:00.074 --> 04:03.326
-fries, salt and pepper.
-Are there seat belts
on the bus?

04:03.326 --> 04:06.287
-Are there seat...?
Are you in grade five?
-Yeah.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.707
I don't think there's
seat belts on the bus.

04:08.707 --> 04:12.878
That's not very safe, sir.
I don't want to go.
Can't I just go back to class?

04:12.878 --> 04:16.339
Why would you want to go
to class? This is the best
day ever. It's a field trip.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.259
-You got no school.
-Museums are kind of scary.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.303
No, museums are not.
Old weapons, bones and mummies.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.765
-Oh, no.
-No, this one's different.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.809
-This one's not like that.
-I really don't want to go.

04:27.809 --> 04:33.023
Tell you what. If you come, I
promise I'll make sure nothing
will happen. Is that a deal?

04:33.023 --> 04:36.151
-Deal.
-All right. Give me five.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.319
Good guy.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.072
Do you know first aid?

04:40.072 --> 04:41.531
Yeah, I know first aid!

04:44.743 --> 04:46.661
I know the Heimlich.
That's about it.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.622
-I'll show you the Heimlich.
-No, you'll hurt me.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.251
-You'll hurt me, my back.
-Check your pulse?

04:52.251 --> 04:55.170
-No.
-Very rapid.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.338
-You're nervous.
-You make me nervous.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.928
I need you to sign this.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.725
Wow. How can you work
with that buzz in here?

05:08.725 --> 05:14.022
-What buzz?
-Listen. Bzzzzz.

05:14.022 --> 05:18.652
-I don't hear anything.
-Really? Listen again.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.950
I hear, like, a faint buzz,
but I don't know why that
would bother anyone.

05:24.950 --> 05:30.998
Oh, well, good.
Good for you. I wouldn't be
able to concentrate with that.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.841
Trudy, get me Mr. Malik.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.223
-Let's go, guys. Come on.
-All right, guys, let's go.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.518
-Fun trip. All right.
-OK, that's all the kids

05:51.518 --> 05:54.521
accounted for, right?
That's 38, that's your only job,

05:54.521 --> 05:57.732
-you need to know
38 heads to count.
-My job, 38, Curt Schilling,

05:57.732 --> 05:59.484
-pitcher in my head, stored.
-Don't care.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.987
-Where's Simon, by the way?
-He's meeting us at the museum.

06:01.987 --> 06:06.283
His mom's dropping him off.
Where's your parent volunteer?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.910
-My what?
-Come on. Your parent volunteer.

06:08.910 --> 06:13.707
Oh, for this? For the day.
Picking him up on the way.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.044
-Lives out there.
So, just easier.
-Yeah, that's what you do.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.420
Ya pick up your parent
volunteer. Awesome.

06:19.420 --> 06:23.508
-OK, hurry up. Let's go.
-Ahh! Gerry. God!

06:23.508 --> 06:27.221
Some phys-ed teacher you are.
Parent volunteer?

06:27.221 --> 06:30.307
Come on, Bill, I know you're
tired, but please,
do me this favor.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.060
I'll owe you big time.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.187
Please.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.605
Pretty please.

06:43.402 --> 06:46.156
Oh, my God.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.076
[Gerry clears his throat]

06:49.076 --> 06:52.287
[laughing]

06:52.287 --> 06:56.333
Mr. Gordan.
Hello, Mr. Gordan. Hello.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.752
-Oh, hey, buddy.
-Hey, Mrs. Gordan.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.296
Listen, thanks again for helping
us out today, Mr. Gordan.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.090
-Will you stop it?
-No problem.

07:03.090 --> 07:07.510
-Who is this? Gerry?
-This is Bill, my roommate.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.888
-Bill, this is Bobbi.
-Hey, Bobbi,
it's nice to meet you.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.640
-Hi.
-I forgot to get
a... parent volun--

07:12.640 --> 07:15.269
-Yeah, ya don't say.
-And this is...

07:15.269 --> 07:17.604
-Lucille.
-Lucille. See, I knew.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.689
-That's pretty. OK.
-All right.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.234
-You're unbelievable.
-Come on, seriously?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.945
You're unbelievable. You
could have stopped kissing,
the kids are watching.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.407
-Would you?
-No.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.120
If I'd known it
was just a bulb,
I could have done it myself,

07:33.120 --> 07:37.707
-I just didn't know where
the buzz was coming from.
-Perhaps.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.585
I totally could have
changed a bulb myself.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.754
You find me the people,

07:42.754 --> 07:48.260
you make me the one and all I
do is get you all you want.

07:49.719 --> 07:53.765
Right. Couldn't have
said it better myself.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.145
-[phone rings]
-Are you almost done, Robert?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.521
It's time for your
10 o'clock meeting.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.983
I thought I said
no interruptions.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.986
Sorry. Completely forgot.
Won't happen again.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.156
-Well, can you just cancel it?
-No, not really.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.575
-Why? Who's the meeting with?
-Look up, why don't ya?

08:12.575 --> 08:15.745
[Trudy laughs]

08:15.745 --> 08:18.623
I sit. We talk.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.918
Issues.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.801
-Oh my-- are you kidding me?
-We can drop her off on the way.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.220
Yeah, 'cause that's what
you do, you drop off the dates

08:32.220 --> 08:34.555
of our parent volunteers on
the way to field trips, right?

08:34.555 --> 08:37.476
-Fantastic.
-He's not really a parent,
is he?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.560
-Yes, he is a parent.
-Who's his kid?

08:39.560 --> 08:41.646
His kid's in the school,
but he's not on the trip.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.024
-What's his name?
-Bahram.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.359
Bahram? Why have I
never heard of him?

08:45.359 --> 08:46.651
You don't know every
student in the school.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.195
-Sit down.
-Gerry! Come on.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.280
Bill, Bill, Bill!

08:50.280 --> 08:51.406
We're totally done.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.657
Hey, turn around,

08:52.657 --> 08:54.201
don't watch that.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.085
I'm Gloria, I'm your host
for the day.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.838
These are your tour guides.
Welcome to the museum.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.924
We're all set up, so follow me
to the main entrance.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.009
She's too young.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.635
-For you.
-No.

09:12.635 --> 09:16.764
Stop it. OK guys, hustle inside.
My back is killing me.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.226
-These painkillers are useless.
-How many milligrams you taking?

09:19.226 --> 09:21.602
Probably 30 mg,
you need 60 mg at least.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.189
30 mg won't do anything, the
doctor's won't tell you that.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.774
-They make me nauseous.
-Nausea? I got that.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.236
A little thing I like
to call dimenhydrinate.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.738
Take two of those,
you should feel way better.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.407
How do you know
so much about this?

09:33.407 --> 09:34.908
I thought about going
into pharmaceutical sales,

09:34.908 --> 09:38.286
-but I went teaching instead.
-Oh. Chewable?

09:38.286 --> 09:40.330
No, no, swallow it,
I'm used to them.

09:40.330 --> 09:44.459
-They're addictive though,
be careful.
-What?

09:44.459 --> 09:46.503
-Oh, there's Simon.
-Thanks for the ride, Mom.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.881
-And his mom.
-How was the bus ride, loser?

09:49.881 --> 09:52.633
-Hi, Gerry.
-Hello, Mrs. Hunt.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.012
-Have a good day.
-You too, Mrs. Hunt.

09:56.012 --> 10:00.767
Hello, Mr. Cheeley. Trudy
said we could come right in.

10:00.767 --> 10:05.105
-Trudy...
-[mouthing]

10:05.105 --> 10:07.774
-What is it, Mr. Leung?
-This is Mr. Jefferson.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.610
Yeah, I know
who Mr. Jefferson is.
What's the problem?

10:10.610 --> 10:16.199
-Go on. Tell him.
-I drew a penis on Moby Dick.

10:16.199 --> 10:21.913
And he did not refer
to it as a... penis earlier.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.582
Mr. Jefferson,
have a seat please.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.750
-Have a seat, Mr. Jefferson.
-Mr. Leung, you can go.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.419
I'm going to stay
for the justice.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.296
-Fine.
-Make sure he tells you
the whole story.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.339
-Oh, good, there's more.
-Should have seen what he did

10:31.339 --> 10:35.009
to Tale of Two...

10:35.009 --> 10:39.306
Moses is not holding
the Ten Commandments anymore.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.645
He's holding something else.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.232
This is great, we don't have
to do anything. These tour
guides do the whole thing.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.984
I wonder if we could
leave for a bit.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.906
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.534
I'm gonna be back in a thing,

10:59.534 --> 11:01.828
or I'm just gonna go
for a jiggy,

11:01.828 --> 11:04.956
and then you're going to look
after the kids for a jiffy, OK?

11:04.956 --> 11:07.250
I'm just tired.
I need a coffee or something,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.836
or a coffee! A coffee.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.796
Yeah. Oops. Hey. [laughs]

11:15.758 --> 11:17.927
Not cigarettes,
she mixed drugs.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.054
-You gave her drugs?
-I gave her drugs, but...

11:20.054 --> 11:22.849
-Bad Gerry.
-No, it...

11:22.849 --> 11:25.852
The drugs were to help her,
Simon. They weren't...

11:25.852 --> 11:27.270
Bad.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.565
-Um, sir?
-Hey, buddy. Isn't this great?

11:30.565 --> 11:34.194
-I told ya.
-No, can't you take me
back to school?

11:34.194 --> 11:37.405
-But we just got here.
-I've seen enough.
It's scary here.

11:37.405 --> 11:41.868
What's scary? The tortoise?

11:41.868 --> 11:45.830
-You're afraid of the tortoise?
-I have a thing with tortoises.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.791
-Turtles too.
-What could a tortoise
do to you?

11:48.791 --> 11:52.128
-What if it gets out?
-Gets out?

11:52.128 --> 11:55.256
Do you know how slow a...
If it gets out, you walk away.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.592
You just walk away.
That's how slow they are.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.679
As slow as you want. If you're
going to be afraid of an animal

12:00.679 --> 12:03.390
be afraid of something that
kills you, like a shark,
a tiger or a moose.

12:03.390 --> 12:07.435
-Not a tortoise.
-A moose? I didn't even
know a moose could kill you.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.898
If a moose got hold of you,
a moose could rip you apart.

12:11.898 --> 12:15.235
It would...
you gotta relax.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.987
You can't spend your life
being afraid of everything.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.533
-Yeah, I guess.
-All right?
Now go have some fun.

12:21.533 --> 12:25.495
Get outta here, tiger--
get outta here, swan. Go, swan.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.500
OK, do you guys know if there
was any work left for you?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.419
There was no work left for us,
Mr. Duncan.

12:32.419 --> 12:37.006
-That's good. Mr. Lemire.
-I'm... Mr. Lemire.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.259
I get confused,
you guys look alike.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.929
-Mr. Duncan and I?
-It's a little freaky.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.805
Jimmy, he's a little
bit older than I am.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.601
Hey, sorry I'm late, Mr. Duncan.

12:48.602 --> 12:53.940
-Mr. Lemire.
-Oh. Sorry, sir.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.359
You see?
You look like Mr. Duncan.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.694
Except Mr. Duncan's younger.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.321
He looks younger?
Are you kidding?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.449
-And thinner.
-Thinner?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.410
That's how we tell the
difference, heavy and old,
Mr. Lemire.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.120
Thin and young, Mr. Duncan.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.581
OK, that's about enough of this.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.541
Did Mr. Duncan leave
you guys any work?

13:11.541 --> 13:13.876
Oh, he wanted to keep it
simple for you today

13:13.876 --> 13:17.422
'cause you're not
an academic teacher,
so we should have a work period.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.258
-He said that?
-That's the other way we
can tell the difference

13:20.258 --> 13:22.677
between you two:
he teaches a real subject.

13:31.728 --> 13:35.022
See? There's a big skeleton,
but it's dead.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.109
It's just a skeleton, bones,
nothing to be afraid of.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.695
So it's even scarier
than a moose?

13:40.695 --> 13:43.531
OK, Alex, let's just
forget about the moose,

13:43.531 --> 13:45.199
pretend we never
even talked about it.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.243
So a moose can't kill you?

13:47.243 --> 13:50.330
No, a moose could kill you,
if it found you.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.333
If it's hungry it might eat you,
it might stomp on you,

13:53.333 --> 13:57.170
I don't know, but there's
no moose! It's fish. Okay?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.631
Have fun, go enjoy this place.

13:59.631 --> 14:03.677
Hey! OK, that's probably
not appropriate,

14:03.677 --> 14:05.595
not sure your boss
would approve of that, Gloria.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.847
-I am the boss.
-She's the boss.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.476
OK. Have you guys seen Bobbi?

14:11.476 --> 14:15.188
No, she wandered away
for a bit, I haven't
seen her in a while.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.565
I wasn't paying attention.
I was with the boss.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.859
I gotta find Bobbi.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.446
-Uh, Mr. Hunt?
-Yeah?

14:23.446 --> 14:26.700
-Have you seen Ms. Galka.
-No, I haven't seen her.

14:26.700 --> 14:31.287
Mr. Hunt? I don't know
where Ms. Galka is right now.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.708
-I don't know either.
-Have you seen Alex?

14:34.708 --> 14:38.586
-I just saw Alex.
-Was that before or after
he ran out of here crying?

14:38.586 --> 14:41.631
-He ran outside crying?
Why didn't you tell me?
-I just did.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.176
-Why did he do that?
-He saw that.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.721
Oh, my gosh, are you kidding?

14:47.721 --> 14:54.018
You told him a moose
would eat him, stomp on him
or kill him. Easily.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.770
He said all that to him?
To Alex?

14:55.770 --> 14:58.857
I said it could kill him.

14:58.857 --> 15:02.902
Well, more likely now he's going
to be killed by a car or a
stranger because he's missing.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.864
I wish you were missing.
OK, Simon?

15:05.864 --> 15:10.076
Now can you watch the kids?
'Cause I gotta go find Alex
'cause he's lost right now.

15:10.076 --> 15:15.039
-Got it, Pablo Escobar.
-That's funny, Simon.

15:19.794 --> 15:23.798
Hello, Robert. Well,
I managed to finish
all my work today.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.425
How did your letter turn out?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.260
You know for a fact
I didn't get it done.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.220
And, now I have
to cover off the second half

15:29.220 --> 15:31.848
of Mr. Duncan's class.
So maybe I'll work on
it in there,

15:31.848 --> 15:34.975
-where it's quiet.
-Oh, well,
it's got to get done,

15:34.975 --> 15:39.439
so stay late if you have to.
Know what I'm sayin'?

15:44.402 --> 15:46.863
Alex? C'mon Alex.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.659
Are you lost? You're lost.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.578
Well, there's your mommy.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.955
Go with your mommy.
I don't have time.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.374
-Come here, hon.
-Might want to hang
on to your kids, ma'am.

15:58.374 --> 16:02.837
-Yeah, thanks.
-What kind
of parent is that?

16:02.837 --> 16:05.882
Bat Area! Alex!
Are you in here?

16:05.882 --> 16:10.929
Stop playin' around.
Alex? Alex, is that you?

16:10.929 --> 16:13.473
Come on out,
I'll wait right here, OK?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.935
-I'm not coming out.
-Oh, my gosh.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.271
OK, all right.
I'll come get you.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.023
Even though I'm claustrophobic.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.443
I'll come... Oh, my gosh.

16:25.443 --> 16:29.656
I really need you
to get on the bus.
I don't like tight spaces.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.742
I can't, I'm scared
of the turtles,
the whales and the moose.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.454
You're scared of everything
but dark tunnels, eh?

16:36.454 --> 16:40.625
No, it's safe here.
The museum is scary and you said
nothing bad would happen.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.002
This is bad for me.
This is...

16:43.002 --> 16:47.841
OK, can you meet me halfway?

16:47.841 --> 16:49.383
I'm not going back out there.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.762
These walls, do they
feel like they're closing in?

16:52.762 --> 16:57.433
OK, I'll come getcha
OK, here we go. Here we go.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.979
I see you... I see you.

17:00.979 --> 17:05.358
OK... OK.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.195
OK, you're still a little bit
out of my reach. Oh, gosh.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.782
OK. Oh, don't look back.

17:12.782 --> 17:16.494
Listen, you know when horses
are in a burning barn?

17:16.494 --> 17:18.412
What they do
is they cover their eyes.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.624
They go through the smoke.
When we go back,
we'll hold hands,

17:21.624 --> 17:24.293
we'll stay really tight,
we'll help each other
get through this.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.672
Sir, I'm scared of horses.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.132
Hey, little man,
you scared of ice cream?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.092
-No.
-All right, if you come out,
Mr. Duncan's going

17:32.092 --> 17:33.803
-to buy us all ice cream.
-OK.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.014
Yeah, good deal, eh, buddy?

17:36.014 --> 17:39.893
Bill? Now someone come for me.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.396
All right! You made it out.
Way to go, buddy.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.315
-Good job. Found that, homie.
-Welcome back.

17:51.029 --> 17:55.324
Guys? OK, go fast.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.577
Go... don't think about it.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.622
[mumbles] I don't have any money
for ice cream.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.460
OK, everyone,
let's get back on the bus.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.629
-Nice job, Bill. Let's go.
-Thank you.

18:08.629 --> 18:13.843
-Bill saved Alex, sir.
-No, Lucy. No, I had him
in there. I had him.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.178
-Time to get the bus, champ.
-Oh, God.

18:16.178 --> 18:21.308
Suffocating in there.
I risked my life.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.770
Bill didn't do it.
Oh, God, that was scary.

18:23.770 --> 18:28.399
OK, please just continue on
with whatever it is
you were doing.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.318
I have a lot of work to do.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.530
-Ms. Garland?
-Mr. Duncan left me
instructions on what we

18:34.530 --> 18:37.825
-were supposed to do today.
-How thoughtful.
Let's hear them.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.287
First we gotta split into
groups of three and discuss the
benefits of the NAFTA agreement

18:41.287 --> 18:43.915
-for ten minutes.
-OK, so let's go ahead
and do that.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.834
-There's more, sir.
-Go on.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.796
He wants you to evaluate us
on how well we work together,

18:49.796 --> 18:52.090
how much we accomplished
and how strong our argument is.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.134
-You will then give us
a mark out of ten.
-Fine.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.763
And after we're done that, he
asked that you put these notes
on the board for us to copy.

18:58.763 --> 19:02.058
Why wouldn't he just
make photocopies?

19:02.058 --> 19:05.937
He said he ran out of copies
this term and you wouldn't
give him any extra.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.400
OK, so why don't you go ahead
and do the first part quickly

19:11.400 --> 19:16.405
while I jot the notes
down on the board.
Thank you, Jimmy.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.456
Tuck in your shirt.

19:33.089 --> 19:37.301
Justine, do me a favor
and go count how many people
we have here, OK?

19:37.301 --> 19:41.347
-And let me know what you get.
-I got her number.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.266
Yeah, your wheeling
and dealing almost
cost me my job. Nice.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.186
Well, me not being here could
have cost you your job, so...

19:47.186 --> 19:48.604
It's good thing I saved
that kid.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.272
You never saved the kid.
I saved the kid.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.650
-I saved the kid. I'm a hero.
-You did not.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.111
-I wish Bill was our teacher.
-Get on the bus, Jonah.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.780
-He knows what's up.
-How many people?

19:57.780 --> 20:00.366
-38 students, sir.
-38, Curt Schilling.

20:00.366 --> 20:04.912
Let's go! On the bus!
You gave me a real scare.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.372
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.666
Is that why you got all sweaty
and nervous in the cave?

20:08.666 --> 20:12.378
Geez, sir. You can't spend your
life being scared of everything.

20:12.378 --> 20:16.215
Are you kidding me?
You're scared of a tortoise.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.392
Mr. Duncan, quite the
lesson plan you left yesterday.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.602
Yeah, lots going on.
Sorry about all that.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.313
Well, I managed to get most
of your notes on the board.

20:31.313 --> 20:35.317
There were a lot,
and your group evaluations
are right there on your desk.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.486
But that's not what I'm doing,

20:37.486 --> 20:39.279
"Alexander The Great"
with my senior class.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.157
That's my grade nine class.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.118
So you wrote the wrong notes.
Uh-oh.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.286
So it was
a complete waste of time?

20:46.286 --> 20:49.373
No, because, actually I have
to do that and now it's done.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.543
-So thank you.
-What about the group
evaluations? Yup.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.336
That was a waste of time.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.549
-Hey! Jeff!
-Hey, Gerry.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.593
-How'd it go?
-Oh, it was great.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.596
Yeah, you were right,
the kids thought we were
one and the same.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.598
I tried to tell you that
over and over again. OK?

21:05.598 --> 21:09.102
Thank God you wore phys-ed
attire. What if I
start teaching phys-ed?

21:09.102 --> 21:10.978
That's gonna be
confusing for everyone.

21:10.978 --> 21:14.607
I think so.
We'll figure it out. All right,
thanks for covering it.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.316
Yeah, see ya, Gerry.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.652
-Oh, boy. Hey!
-Hey, sir.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.155
I gave the wrong notes
to Mr. Cheeley
just like you said.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.740
I saw that.
What about Mr. Lemire?

21:22.740 --> 21:24.491
Was everybody a little
thrown thinking it was me?

21:24.491 --> 21:25.952
Still a few people
were confused.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.621
I know. There's gotta
be something we can do.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.248
You know, he even
kind of sounds like you.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.874
He does sound like me!
You know what?

21:31.874 --> 21:33.709
He never started sounding
like me until he met me.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.462
It's almost like
he's trying to emulate.

21:36.462 --> 21:40.382
-Sorry about the confusion.
-Yeah, it's OK.

21:43.010 --> 21:48.599
[PA announcement]
Attention, the museum
is now closing for the day.
