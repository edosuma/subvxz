SHOULDN'T THEY
BE UP BY NOW?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.238
(Niles)
I'M SURE THEY'RE FINE.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.173
THEY'RE GONNA RUN
OUT OF AIR.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.574
I'M HAPPY
TO KILL MY DAUGHTER,

02:20.608 --> 02:22.576
BUT I FEEL A LITTLE AWKWARD
ABOUT KILLING YOUR SON.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.345
THEY'RE SPENDING TIME
TOGETHER.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.614
IT'S GOOD.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.682
WE'RE A FAMILY NOW.
THEY NEED TO BOND.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.919
YEAH, WELL...

02:31.952 --> 02:34.288
THEY CAN BOND
WITH FULL AIR INTAKE.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.392
JULIE, SURFACE NOW.

[giggling]

02:45.966 --> 02:47.635
PLEASE DON'T SCARE ME
LIKE THAT.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.271
WHAT?
YOU SAID WE SHOULD BOND.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.973
WELL, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.210
(Niles)
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE
ANYTHING OFF THE WRECK.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.255
HOW COOL IS THIS?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.559
THEY KIND OF LOOK
LIKE FEATHERS.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.361
(Lulu)
CAN I SEE?

03:13.394 --> 03:14.495
[glass shatters]

03:14.528 --> 03:15.829
OW!

03:15.863 --> 03:17.531
JULIE!

03:18.566 --> 03:20.534
GET HER A TOWEL.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.736
WHAT WAS IN THAT JAR?

[Massive Attack's Teardrop]

03:29.410 --> 03:37.418

04:00.541 --> 04:02.310

IN MY OFFICE?

(Foreman)
IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING.NG?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.980
WHERE'S CHASE?
(Taub)
HE'S NOT HERE BECAUSE

04:07.014 --> 04:08.882
IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING.

04:08.916 --> 04:12.320
16-YEAR-OLD GIRL--
HIGH FEVER, VOMITING,

04:12.353 --> 04:13.721
BLOODSHOT EYES.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.757
WOW. THE CASE
OF THE REALLY BAD FLU.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.359
HMM, LET ME SEE.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.361
DID I LEAVE ANYTHING OUT?
OH, YEAH.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.529
THE SMALLPOX.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.999
SMALLPOX WAS ERADICATED
OVER 30 YEARS AGO.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.668
SO WERE HUSH PUPPIES.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.371
HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT YOUR LOCAL
HIPSTER COFFEE SHOP LATELY?

04:30.404 --> 04:31.939
SMALLPOX DOESN'T EXIST
OUTSIDE OF P4 LABS

04:31.972 --> 04:33.307
AND BIOWEAPON PLANTS.

04:33.341 --> 04:37.445
SHE WAS IN BERMUDA.
WHERE SHE WAS SCUBA DIVING
ON THE WRECK

04:37.478 --> 04:39.980
OF A DUTCH SLAVE SHIP
THAT HAD BEEN INTENTIONALLY SUNK

04:40.013 --> 04:42.483
BECAUSE AN EPIDEMIC OF SMALLPOX
HAD BROKEN OUT ON BOARD.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.485
(Foreman)
WAS THE SHIP SUNK IN WATER?

04:44.518 --> 04:47.020
BECAUSE VIRUSES CAN'T SURVIVE
CONTACT WITH WATER.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.323
IF THE VIRUS HAD BEEN KEPT ON
THE OUTSIDE OF AN AIRTIGHT JAR,

04:49.357 --> 04:50.223
THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.326
THE JAR HELD OLD-SCHOOL
INOCULATIONS.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.995
[cell phone ringing]
THEY KEPT THE SCABS
OF THE INFECTED PEOPLE.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.431
THE VIRUS CAN'T SURVIVE
OVER 200 YEARS.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.667
YOU HAVE.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.402
[slightly higher voice]
THANKS FOR CALLING BACK.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.870
UH, LISTEN,
I'M A SCREENWRITER,

05:02.903 --> 05:05.105
AND IS IT
THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE

05:05.138 --> 05:06.840
FOR SMALLPOX TO SURVIVE

05:06.874 --> 05:09.042
FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS
UNDERWATER

05:09.076 --> 05:11.111
IN A SEALED GLASS JAR?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.714
(man)
YES, BUT--RETICALLY,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.082
THANK YOU.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.717
[normal voice]
SO WHO DO WE BELIEVE--

05:16.750 --> 05:18.586

05:22.390 --> 05:24.658
AND VACCINATE
THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.794
WE SHOULD TEST
FOR THE 21ST-CENTURY SUSPECTS--

05:26.827 --> 05:28.796
VARICELLA AND MEASLES.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.898
YOU'RE FREE TO PERFORM
WHATEVER UNNECESSARY TESTS

05:30.931 --> 05:32.132
YOU WANT, FOREMAN.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.601
SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED
YEARS AGO.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.012
[alarm blares]

05:46.714 --> 05:49.517
WHY THE HELL DO YOU GUYS
HAVE US QUARANTINED IN HERE?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.419
WE'RE JUST TAKING
EVERY PRECAUTION.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.986
AGAINST WHAT?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.723
WHAT DO YOU THINK I HAVE?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.658
(Taub)
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TETANUS

05:57.691 --> 06:00.461
FROM THE GLASS JAR
THAT SLICED YOUR HAND.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.695
I REMEMBER
TETANUS SHOTS.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.764
THAT DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE TETANUS SHOTS.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.433
IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH
GOING INTO,

06:05.466 --> 06:07.000
BECAUSE THE ODDS
ARE ASTRONOMICAL.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.804
[whispering]
TELL ME.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.841
AGAIN, IT'S--

06:13.874 --> 06:16.610
SMALLPOX.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.878
SMALLPOX?

06:19.079 --> 06:22.082
THE VACCINE WILL PROTECT YOU
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT

06:22.115 --> 06:24.985
AND LESSEN THE SEVERITY
IF YOU ALREADY DO.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.554
B-BUT IT'S
A BILLION-TO-ONE, SO...

06:26.587 --> 06:29.156
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO PANIC
OR ANYTHING.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.791
HOW DO I NOT PANIC

06:30.824 --> 06:32.460
WITH THAT INFORMATION?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.770
IDIOT IN EXAM ROOM ONE
NEEDS ANTIDIARRHEALS

06:42.803 --> 06:43.971
AND A DICTIONARY.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.906
YOU'RE NOT SCHEDULED
FOR CLINIC DUTY NOW.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.109
I HAD SOME FREE TIME.
I OWED FOUR HOURS.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.444
DON'T YOU HAVE A CASE?

06:50.478 --> 06:52.580
YEAH.
THEN DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

06:53.947 --> 06:54.982
ARE YOU A STEPFORD DOCTOR?

06:55.015 --> 06:58.552
IF YOU'RE BUSY,
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DOWN HERE.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.553
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.490
YEP. GET OUT OF HERE.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.160
I CAN'T.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.697
I FORGOT HER
STUFFED ANIMAL AT HOME.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.831
IT'S BEEN WITH HER

07:10.864 --> 07:12.500
THROUGH ALL
THE CHEMO SESSIONS SO FAR.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.001
I NEED LAMBY.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.836
HE DOESN'T WANT ME
TO DO IT ALONE.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.238
HONEY,
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.073
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO BE BRAVE, OKAY?

07:20.107 --> 07:22.142
WHAT IF I GET SOMEONE
TO SIT WITH HER

07:22.175 --> 07:24.478
WHILE YOU RUN HOME
AND GET LAMBY?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.748
I'LL GET A NURSE.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.783
THEN I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH A...

07:29.817 --> 07:32.520
VERY SICK MAN.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.262
I THINK SHE KNOWS.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.032
WHO IS SHE,
AND WHAT DOES SHE KNOW?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.935
CUDDY. AND...
THAT I FAKED A LAB TEST

07:47.968 --> 07:50.003
AND LIED TO HER
TO SAVE MY LAST PATIENT.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.872
WHAT DID SHE DO?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.842
SHE LET ME OUT OF CLINIC DUTY
BY SAYING I HAD A CASE.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.143
SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.846
SHE'S ALSO PROBABLY
NEVER ORDERED THE PASTA SPECIAL

07:58.879 --> 08:00.147
IN THE CAFETERIA.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.149
WOULD THAT ALSO HAVE

08:02.182 --> 08:03.851
SOME SPECIAL PARANOID MESSAGE
TO SEND YOU?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.218
I AM NOT IMAGINING THIS.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.254
IT'S AN ABERRATION IN THE WAY
THAT SHE TREATS ME.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.022
HOW DO I FIND OUT
WHAT IT MEANS?

08:09.056 --> 08:10.123
YOU DON'T.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.625
IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW,
ALL YOU'RE GONNA DO

08:11.659 --> 08:13.026
BY SNIFFING AROUND
IS MAKE HER SUSPICIOUS.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.062
IF SHE DOES KNOW,
YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.064
WHAT IF I DIE OF CURIOSITY
IN THE MEANTIME?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.166
YOU WERE AN IDIOT FOR LYING
TO HER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.602
DON'T BE MORE
OF AN IDIOT NOW.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.071
SAY NOTHING TO NO ONE
ABOUT ANYTHING.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.239
THAT INCLUDES ME.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.182
(Taub)
IT'S NOT SMALLPOX.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.651
BLOOD WORK SUGGESTS
SOME OTHER INFECTION.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.787
WHITE COUNT IS WAY DOWN.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.990
MASTERS,
HAVE YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.792
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.259
AH, PROBABLY JUST
A DRY SPELL.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.829
HOUSE, YOU DO REALIZE

08:48.862 --> 08:50.263
WE JUST RULED OUT SMALLPOX?

08:50.297 --> 08:54.101
WOULD YOU EVER BE EXTRA NICE
TO A THEORETICAL BOYFRIEND

08:54.134 --> 08:55.769
IF YOU WERE
REALLY MAD AT HIM?

08:55.803 --> 08:58.806
I GUESS THE ONLY REASON
I WOULD BE EXTRA NICE

08:58.839 --> 09:01.174
IS BECAUSE I'M ANGRY,
AND I JUST WANT HIM TO GO AWAY

09:01.208 --> 09:04.144
SO I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH HIM ANYMORE.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.146
YOU PASSIVE/AGGRESSIVE BITCH.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.848
YOU JUST ASKED ME--

09:07.881 --> 09:10.017
WHAT ABOUT FOREMAN'S
UNNECESSARY TESTS?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.218
NEGATIVE FOR VARICELLA
AND MEASLES.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.820
SO ALL OF OUR IDEAS
ARE OFF THE TABLE.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.955
I'M PUTTING MINE BACK ON.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.690
PATIENT'S A DIVER.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.291
UNDER INCREASED PRESSURE,
EVERYTHING IN THE BLOOD

09:18.325 --> 09:20.728
GETS SCARED, PANICS,
RUNS, AND HIDES.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.129
ANTIBODIES COULD BE
IN THE JOINTS.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.197
TAP HER KNEE, ANKLE,
SHOULDER,

09:24.231 --> 09:27.334
AND ANY OTHER JOINT
IN HER SMALLPOX-RIDDEN BODY.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.869
GOOD TALK.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.084
[sighs]

09:44.117 --> 09:45.252
YOU KNOW.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.087
OF COURSE I KNOW.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.289
OH, THANK GOD.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.059
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST
BEING PARANOID.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.628
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

09:54.662 --> 09:56.897
'CAUSE I WANTED YOU
TO COME TO ME AND APOLOGIZE.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.167
I CAN'T APOLOGIZE IF
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.334
YOU LIED TO MY FACE.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.703
TO DO MY JOB,

10:02.736 --> 10:05.072
TO SAVE A PATIENT'S LIFE.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.174
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO GO
ALL GODFATHER ON YOU.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.809
THIS WAS BUSINESS.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.078
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING PERSONAL.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.981
WELL, YOU DON'T GET TO LIE
TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.050
I CAN'T COMPARTMENTALIZE
MY LIFE LIKE THAT.

10:17.084 --> 10:20.187
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD PRACTICE,
'CAUSE IT COMES IN HANDY.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.195
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.041
OW.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.810
SORRY.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.679
I HAVE TO GET THE NEEDLE
BEHIND THE BONE.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.748
I'M RUNNING
OUT OF BONES.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.449
IF THIS IS A WASTE
OF TIME--

10:49.482 --> 10:50.851
LAST ONE.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.286
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE...

10:54.154 --> 10:55.655
WHAT?

10:57.224 --> 10:58.726
WHAT--WHAT IS IT?

11:00.393 --> 11:03.897
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO CALL THE CDC.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.133
I THINK YOU DO HAVE
SMALLPOX.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.377
(Julie)
AM I GONNA DIE?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.312
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT
TERRORISTS WANT TO USE

11:19.346 --> 11:20.714
TO KILL EVERYONE, RIGHT?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.215
LIKE, THERE'S NO CURE.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.152
THERE ARE TREATMENTS.
WE CAN GIVE YOU CIDOFOVIR.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.088
I DON'T THINK YOU CARE
ABOUT THE DRUGS' NAMES.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.322
BOTTOM LINE--
IT'S 30% FATAL,

11:29.356 --> 11:31.158
WHICH MEANS YOUR CHANCES
OF BEING OKAY

11:31.191 --> 11:33.360
ARE ABOUT THE SAME
AS A BASKETBALL PLAYER'S CHANCE

11:33.393 --> 11:34.394
AT HITTING A FREE THROW,

11:34.427 --> 11:38.498
UNLESS SHE FINDS DARK,
PURPLISH SKIN BLOTCHES.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.034
WHAT WOULD
PURPLE BLOTCHES MEAN?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.336
HEMORRHAGIC-TYPE SMALLPOX.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.305
IN WHICH CASE,
HER CHANCES ARE MORE LIKE...

11:45.338 --> 11:47.975
SHAQ HITTING A FREE THROW.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.510
WELL, NO PURPLE SKIN,
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.979
WHAT IS IT?

11:52.012 --> 11:54.281
THERE'S A RASH UNDER
YOUR DAUGHTER'S ARM.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.350
LIKE MORE OF THOSE
GROSS BUMPS?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.389
NO. IT'S JUST
A REGULAR RASH.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.291
W-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:04.324 --> 12:07.928
IT MEANS IT'S NOT SMALLPOX.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.938
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU SEE HOUSE'S SIDE?

12:17.971 --> 12:21.809
IT'S NOT EVEN A SIDE.
IT'S A FICTIONAL CONSTRUCTION.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.410
SHE'S EXPECTING HOUSE
NOT TO LIE?

12:23.443 --> 12:24.978
IF SHE'S USING
THE RELATIONSHIP

12:25.012 --> 12:26.880
AS A RATIONALE
TO TRY TO CHANGE THINGS--

12:26.914 --> 12:28.381
WAIT. WAIT.
ARE YOU SAYING

12:28.415 --> 12:30.217
IT'S OKAY FOR US
TO LIE TO EACH OTHER?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.985
NO, WE HAVE
A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP--

12:32.019 --> 12:33.320
I THINK A BETTER ONE.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.155
LYING WAS NEVER PART OF IT.
THEIRS IS BUILT ON IT.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.424
[pager beeping]
SORRY, I HAVE TO GO.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.960
OH, COME ON, I HAVE TO LEAVE
IN, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.394
CAN'T IT WAIT?
THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.963
THE NURSE WATCHING HER
GOT CALLED AWAY.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.233
IT'S A LONG STORY,
BUT I'VE GOT TO BABYSIT.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.235
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
MM-HMM.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.338
[man over P.A.]
ATTENTION--
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,

12:51.371 --> 12:53.273
ALL HOSPITAL ENTRANCES
AND EXITS WILL BE RESTRICTED

12:53.306 --> 12:55.242
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.276
CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL
HAS ORDERED

12:56.309 --> 12:57.945
PRINCETON PLAINSBORO HOSPITAL
LOCKED DOWN.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.280
WELL, I GUESS
I CAN STAY.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.356
PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE ROOM.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.960
[air hissing]

13:12.993 --> 13:16.529
I'M DR. BRODA,
HEAD OF INFECTION CONTROL, CDC.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.866
AND YOUR PROTECTIVE SUITS
ARE NOT ADEQUATE.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.533
TURNS OUT
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.303
RASH UNDER THE ARM
MEANS IT'S NOT SMALLPOX.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.338
FALSE ALARM. SORRY.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.908
HOPE THE TRAFFIC
WASN'T TOO BAD.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.309
RASH IS CONSISTENT
WITH SMALLPOX.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.844
NOT IF IT PRESENTS
AFTER PUSTULES.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.479
SHE'S PROBABLY JUST ALLERGIC
TO THE BEDSHEETS

13:32.512 --> 13:34.948
OR THE HOSPITAL GOWN,
AND YOU SIMPLY DIDN'T NOTICE IT.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.350
WE'RE GONNA AIRLIFT BLOOD
AND TISSUE SAMPLES TO ATLANTA.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.053
WE'LL HAVE THE DNA RESULTS
IN 18 HOURS.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.255
IN THE MEANTIME, PLEASE,

13:42.289 --> 13:43.623
STEP OUT OF THE ROOM.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.393
YOU BROUGHT THE PLANE?
COOL.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.564
(Masters)
WHEN WE LEFT, JULIE'S FEVER

13:51.598 --> 13:53.266
HAD CLIMBED TO OVER 103.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.035
(Taub)
IT'S NOT SMALLPOX.
SHE'S NOT DYING.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.236
AND IT'S NOT OUR CASE.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.404
NEED ANY OTHER REASONS
TO FORGET IT?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.539
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE?

13:59.572 --> 14:02.275
CHASE SHOWED UP.
I WAS HERE AT 9:00.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.244
SO YOU GUYS JUST WANT TO DO
NOTHING FOR THE NEXT 18 HOURS

14:04.277 --> 14:06.246
UNTIL THEY TELL US
IT'S NOT SMALLPOX?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.315
CAN'T WE SPEND THE TIME
DISCUSSING

14:08.348 --> 14:11.551
WHAT LOOKS LIKE SMALLPOX
BUT ISN'T SMALLPOX?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.520
MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.255
YOU HAVE TO COMPARE LESIONS
TO DIFFERENTIATE.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.289
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO THE PATIENT

14:16.323 --> 14:17.324
OR ANY NEW INFORMATION.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.027
BUT WE DO HAVE ACCESS
TO THE OTHER PATIENTS--

14:20.060 --> 14:23.196
THE ONES WHO DIED
OF THE SAME THING IN 1793.

14:23.230 --> 14:26.366
IT'S THE CAPTAIN'S LOG
FROM THE SOTOS OOSLERZOON.

14:26.399 --> 14:30.203
MARITIME MUSEUM IN BERMUDA
GRACIOUSLY SENT OVER A PDF.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.271
PROBLEM SOLVED.

14:31.304 --> 14:35.608
I ASSUME AT LEAST ONE OF YOU
SPEAKS FLUENT DUTCH.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.211
(Foreman)
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
IN THE NETHERLANDS.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.012
NOBODY'S WORKING.

14:39.046 --> 14:42.249
OH, YOU CAN ALWAYS
FIND SOMEONE.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.451
OH, YES.
MY NAME IS GEERTE.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.386
ARE YOU HANDSOME,

14:46.419 --> 14:47.955
SEXIEST AMERICAN MAN?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.290
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE--

14:50.323 --> 14:53.927
I WOULD SAY
THAT I AM, YEAH.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.628
I WANT YOU TO TRANSLATE
SOMETHING FOR ME.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.264
WHY YOU WANT I TRANSLATE?

14:57.297 --> 15:01.268
I DO TOPLESS,
TOYS, AND--

15:01.301 --> 15:02.369
JUST DO THE TRANSLATION.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.938
SHE CAN TRANSLATE HOWEVER
SHE FEELS MOST COMFORTABLE.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.473
WHATEVER.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.176
YOU PUT IN CREDIT CARD.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.610
HOUSE, THE HOSPITAL
HAS TRANSLATORS ON CALL--

15:10.643 --> 15:12.445
SHUT UP.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.250
HONEY, COULD YOU EMAIL
OUR NEW FRIEND

15:17.284 --> 15:20.453
THE CAPTAIN'S LOG?
SURE THING...

15:20.487 --> 15:24.324
SEXIEST AMERICAN MAN.
[giggles]

15:24.357 --> 15:27.494
"ON MORNING OF 14, JULY,

15:27.527 --> 15:32.632
I BOARDED SOTOS OOSLERZOON
WITH TWO TRUNKS AND MY CAT."

15:32.665 --> 15:34.701
AW!
THE CAPTAIN HAD A CAT.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.469
ISN'T SHE ADORABLE?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.171
GO AHEAD AND SKIP
TO THE PART

15:38.205 --> 15:39.672
WHERE PEOPLE GET SICK.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.374
MM...AH, HERE.

15:41.408 --> 15:45.345
"THE PASSENGER HAS A FEVER,
SHAKING, AND RED EYES."

15:45.378 --> 15:49.216
OOH. ALSO AFRICAN MAN
MAKE GO IN HIS PANTS.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.052
WHAT ABOUT THE CAPTAIN,
THE CREW?

15:52.085 --> 15:55.122
MM, NO. IT SAY ONLY
AFRICAN MEN SICK.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.457
IT CAN'T BE SMALLPOX.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.160
AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION

16:00.193 --> 16:02.295
MEANS IT'S
AN EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY KILLER.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.364
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DISEASE
THAT DISCRIMINATES.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.632
SICKLE CELL.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.367
THE DISEASE
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RACIST.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.435
IT COULD BE CLASSIST.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.004
VITAMIN "D" DEFICIENCY
FROM LACK OF SUNLIGHT

16:11.038 --> 16:12.739
WEAKENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM,
MAKES THE SLAVES

16:12.772 --> 16:14.641
MORE VULNERABLE TO MALARIA
OR DENGUE FEVER.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.576
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET
PUSTULES FROM ANY OF THOSE.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.311
CAPTAIN AND CREW
GOT CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.548
SLAVES DRANK
WHATEVER THEY COULD.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.217
SCROFULA.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.154
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALLED
CERVICAL T.B. LYMPHADENITIS

16:27.187 --> 16:28.621
IN THE 1700s.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.123
SCROFULICIOUS--

16:30.157 --> 16:32.459
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALLED
"ANNOYING" IN THE 1700s.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.760
IS SHE WRONG?

16:36.296 --> 16:37.764
THEN THEY DIED FOR NOTHING.

16:37.797 --> 16:41.234
THOSE SLAVES COULD HAVE LED
LONG, FULFILLING LIVES

16:41.268 --> 16:43.236
MOWING MY ANCESTORS' LAWNS.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.771
FOREMAN.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.174
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A SECOND?

16:52.379 --> 16:54.814
WE NEED TO TEST FOR T.B.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.316
T.B. MIGHT FIT,

16:56.349 --> 16:59.219
BUT IT'S TOO SLOW-MOVING
TO KILL HER ANYTIME SOON.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.388
THERE'S NO WAY THE CDC'S
GONNA GIVE US ACCESS.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.390
THAT'S WHY
WE DON'T THINK IT'S T.B.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.358
WE THINK IT'S
MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE,

17:05.392 --> 17:07.427
WHICH COULD KILL HER
BEFORE THE RESULTS COME BACK.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.330
AND ONCE I GAIN ACCESS,
I RUN THE T.B. TEST.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.432
YOU COULD HAVE SAID
ALL THAT IN THERE.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.401
IN FRONT OF THE NARC?
AS IF.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.336
ARE YOU SO AFRAID
OF THIS NEW GIRL,

17:16.369 --> 17:17.470
WE HAVE TO TAKE
ELABORATE MEASURES

17:17.504 --> 17:19.839
EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO SKIRT
AROUND ETHICAL BOUNDARIES?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.309
ELABORATE MEASURES?
WE TOOK A WALK--

17:22.342 --> 17:24.277
A WALK YOU
WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANYWAY.

17:24.311 --> 17:27.180
ACTUALLY, I SAVED YOU
FROM THE HORRIBLE

17:27.214 --> 17:29.516
POST-DIFFERENTIAL
TRAFFIC JAM.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.554
MENINGOCOCCUS.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.356
WE BELIEVE THE RASH
UNDER JULIE'S ARMPIT

17:36.389 --> 17:38.625
IS ACTUALLY
PETECHIAL SPOTS.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.360
WHEN ADDED TO THE HIGH FEVER,
THE VOMITING--

17:40.393 --> 17:42.229
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN
ANY SEIZURES, NO STIFF NECK.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.197
IF I COULD JUST GAIN ACCESS
TO THE PATIENT,

17:44.231 --> 17:45.498
I CAN INVESTIGATE
THE RASH FURTHER.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.766
I'LL TAKE A LOOK.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.335
I CAN WEAR YOUR GEAR.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.304
I'LL TAKE EVERY
NECESSARY PRECAUTION.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.406
YOU COME TO ME
WITH A WEAK DIAGNOSIS.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.208
I EVEN OFFER TO INVESTIGATE,

17:55.242 --> 17:57.244
BUT THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.413
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE?

18:06.353 --> 18:07.220
SIR...

18:07.254 --> 18:08.855
ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

18:08.888 --> 18:12.425
IT'S JUST A HEADACHE.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.462
BABY.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.630
[labored breathing]
BABY.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.168
DAD...

18:21.201 --> 18:22.335
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.636
SOMEBODY, PLEASE...

18:23.670 --> 18:25.838
GET IN HERE NOW!

18:25.872 --> 18:28.475
[gasps]
[groans]

18:30.343 --> 18:32.345
THIS IS NOT MENINGOCOCCUS.

18:32.379 --> 18:35.182
YOU'RE NOT GETTING IN HERE.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.322
COOL.
(Chase)
NOT REALLY--NOT FOR THEM

18:42.355 --> 18:43.723
AND NOT FOR YOU--
THE DAD'S NEW SYMPTOMS

18:43.756 --> 18:45.458
ARE CONSISTENT
WITH THEM HAVING SMALLPOX.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.694
WOULD BE
IF HE HAD A HEADACHE.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.628
HE DOES HAVE A HEADACHE.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.763
NO. HE JUST SAID, "OW,"
AND HELD HIS HEAD.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.864
(Foreman)
ACTUALLY, HE SAID, "OW."

18:51.898 --> 18:53.700
THEN HE SAID,
"IT'S A HEADACHE."

18:53.733 --> 18:55.935
WHICH COULD BE INDICATIVE
OF HEAD PAIN.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.838
HEADACHE IS CAUSED BY MUSCLE
TENSION OR VASCULAR STRETCHING.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.208
HEAD PAIN IS CAUSED BY TRAUMA,
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE

19:01.241 --> 19:03.743
SUCH EVENTS AS A BLEED
IN THE BRAIN FROM T.B.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.213
WE'RE BACK TO T.B.?
WE NEVER LEFT.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.880
(Foreman)
WE'LL NEED TO DO A C.T.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.616
AND I SORT OF HAVE A HUNCH
THAT THE CDC'S

19:09.649 --> 19:11.351
NOT GONNA APPROVE
OF US MOVING THE PATIENT.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.423
CHASE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A SECOND?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.395
YOU JUST TRIED THIS.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.597
I'M NOT A BETTER LIAR
THAN FOREMAN.
SURE, YOU ARE.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.399
YOU'RE DESCENDED
FROM CONVICTS.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.435
PLUS, THERE'S NO LIE
THIS TIME.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.702
IT'S A BAIT AND SWITCH.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.404
YOU PROPOSE THAT WE
DON'T HAVE TO MOVE HIM

19:31.438 --> 19:32.872
IF WE DO
A PNEUMOENCEPHALOGRAPH.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.476
THAT'S 60-YEAR-OLD TECHNOLOGY
THAT KILLED PATIENTS.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.247
EXACTLY. HE'LL COMPROMISE
ON THE C.T.
THIS ISN'T CUDDY.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.382
YOUR JEDI MIND TRICKS
WON'T WORK HERE.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.585
[imitating Obi Wan]
THESE AREN'T THE DROIDS
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.820
YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.389
GOING BEHIND YOUR BACK

19:49.422 --> 19:51.391
WORKS BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE NOT FACING US.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.760
INSTEAD OF WHATEVER LIE
YOU'RE GONNA TELL BRODA,

19:53.793 --> 19:55.695
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HIM
THE TRUTH?

19:55.728 --> 19:56.829
IF WE ARE HONEST
AND REASONABLE--

19:56.863 --> 19:58.365
PEOPLE OF ALL RACES
AND CREEDS

19:58.398 --> 19:59.699
WILL LIVE TOGETHER
IN PEACE AND HARMONY.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.701
HOW DID YOUR FIRST PLAN
WORK OUT?

20:04.437 --> 20:05.705
PERMISSION GRANTED.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.640
THANK YOU.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.245
AFTER SHE GETS DENIED,
DO THE BAIT AND SWITCH.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.416
THEY WON'T LET YOUR MOMMY
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL

20:16.449 --> 20:18.918
BECAUSE OF AN EMERGENCY
DOWNSTAIRS.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.754
BUT WE HAVE TO GET
STARTED.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.424
I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT MY LAMBY.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.893
WHO IS SHE?

20:26.926 --> 20:29.396
I'M NOBODY.
I'M LEAVING SOON.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.898
HER NAME IS SAM,
AND SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.902
WHAT DOES LAMBY USUALLY DO
WHILE YOU GET YOUR TREATMENT?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.704
HE HOLDS MY HAND.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.307
WELL, YOU COULD HOLD
MY HAND.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.610
THAT WON'T WORK.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.812
WELL, SOMETIMES
WE HAVE TO DO THINGS

20:45.845 --> 20:47.647
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.450
YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.
YOU HAVE TO EAT YOUR VEGETABLES.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.452
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR MEDICINE.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.721
YOU HAVE TO.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.824
I WANT MY MOMMY.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.025
YEAH.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.361
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

21:05.698 --> 21:09.769
[whispering] YOU KNOW, I'M
PRETTY SURE LAMBY HAS A COUSIN

21:09.802 --> 21:11.938
DOWN IN THE GIFT SHOP.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.811
[imitates crowd cheering]

21:21.348 --> 21:22.815
HOLD OFF A MINUTE.

21:22.849 --> 21:23.950
I'M IN OVERTIME.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.455
OH!
[giggles]

21:28.488 --> 21:30.623
UH, BRODA AGREED
TO C.T. THE DAD'S BRAIN.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.792
WELL, THAT SUCKS.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.961
BUT I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.096
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN IT WITH THE TRUTH.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.731
HE'S A HYPOCRITE.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.401
HIS POSITION EVER SINCE
HE'S BEEN HERE HAS BEEN--

21:41.434 --> 21:43.035
I-I POINTED OUT
THAT EITHER WE'RE RIGHT,

21:43.069 --> 21:44.804
AND HE'S THE HERO
FOR ENDING THE CRISIS,

21:44.837 --> 21:47.840
OR HE'S RIGHT, AND HE GETS TO BE
THE FIRST PERSON

21:47.874 --> 21:50.777
TO LOOK AT A BRAIN
INFECTED WITH SMALLPOX.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.879
C.T. SCANS WEREN'T AROUND
30 YEARS AGO.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.849
GOOD WORK.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.799
SO I GUESS HONESTY
IS THE BEST POLICY.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.536
WHY'D YOU SAY THAT?
SERIOUSLY...

22:16.569 --> 22:19.005
TO ESTABLISH YOUR VIEWPOINT,
AS IF I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW IT,

22:19.038 --> 22:21.140
OR TO DEMONSTRATE
SOME WEIRD

22:21.173 --> 22:23.843
CROSS-GENERATIONAL
FEMALE SOLIDARITY WITH CUDDY?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.779
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO FILL THE AWKWARD SILENCE.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.682
OH.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.351
WHY HAVE THEY STOPPED?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.988
YOU CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.123
WHY DID YOU STOP?

22:37.156 --> 22:38.525
GET OUT OF THE HALLWAY.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.026
HE DOES NOT HAVE
SMALLPOX.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.795
YES, HE DOES.

22:42.829 --> 22:45.865
IT ITCHES.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.400
HE'S JUST DEVELOPED
PUSTULES.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.135
HE'S NOW TOO DANGEROUS
TO TRANSPORT.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.770
GET OUT OF THE HALLWAY.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.514
(Foreman)
DAD'S VITALS ARE IN THE TOILET.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.716
HE'S GOT
FULL-BLOWN SMALLPOX.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.917
(House)
WHAT ABOUT THE DAUGHTER?

23:04.951 --> 23:07.720
(Masters)
PUSTULE COUNT IS WAY UP.
VITALS ARE WAY DOWN.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.921
MEANS I WAS WRONG.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.791
BUT TO BE PRECISE, I WAS RIGHT
BEFORE I WAS WRONG, SO...

23:11.824 --> 23:13.560
SO WE JUST GIVE UP
AND GO HOME?

23:13.593 --> 23:15.562
ACTUALLY, SOMEBODY
LOCKED THE FRONT DOOR,

23:15.595 --> 23:17.730
BUT, YEAH, WE...
GIVE UP.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.567
WE MIGHT AS WELL KEEP--
WE HAVE OUR DIAGNOSIS.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.602
IF YOU'RE EAGER,
YOU CAN GO FIND US A NEW CASE.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.579
I GUESS SHE'S EAGER
OR HAS A BLIND SPOT FOR SARCASM.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.749
I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THE RASH
UNDER HER ARM

23:36.783 --> 23:38.585
TO SEE IF IT'S MATURED--

23:38.618 --> 23:40.787
YOU CAN LOOK
THROUGH THE GLASS.
I NEED TO BE CLOSER.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.455
IF THE PUSTULES
ARE AT A DIFFERENT STAGE--

23:42.489 --> 23:43.790
SHE'S COMFORTABLE.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.925
WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR RESULTS
BACK IN EIGHT HOURS.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.761
IF IT'S NOT SMALLPOX, YOU CAN BE
THE FIRST ONE IN THERE.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.913
WHY ARE YOU JUST STANDING
OUT THERE?

24:06.946 --> 24:09.048
[intercom clicks]
UH...

24:09.081 --> 24:10.883
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.485
IF YOU'RE FEELING UP TO IT,

24:12.519 --> 24:14.787
CAN YOU SIT UP AND SHOW ME
THE RASH UNDER YOUR ARM?

24:16.523 --> 24:19.258
UH, WAIT.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.793
THE SOLES OF YOUR FEET.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.730
THERE AREN'T ANY LESIONS.
WHO CARES?

24:23.763 --> 24:25.865
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE ELSE.
THIS IS TORTURE.

24:25.898 --> 24:29.736
[intercom clicks]

24:29.769 --> 24:31.638
EVE?

24:31.671 --> 24:36.843
GUESS WHO CAME BY
THE HOSPITAL FOR A VISIT?

24:36.876 --> 24:39.712
[baaing]
HELLO, EVE.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.147
[gasps]

24:41.180 --> 24:43.750
OH, NO!

24:43.783 --> 24:45.284
ALL RIGHT.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.887
I'M GONNA GET A COUPLE
OF NICE NURSES TO COME IN HERE

24:47.920 --> 24:50.657
AND GET YOU TWO READY
FOR THE TREATMENT, ALL RIGHT?

24:50.690 --> 24:52.759
OKAY.

24:57.163 --> 25:00.833
HOW COME LAMBY CAN BE HERE
BUT MOMMY CAN'T?

25:06.773 --> 25:09.942
LAMBY WAS DIRTY.
UM, WE GAVE HER A BATH.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.711
THIS ISN'T LAMBY!

25:18.150 --> 25:21.721
JULIE DOESN'T HAVE
SMALLPOX.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.123
DID I JUST DREAM THE PART

25:24.156 --> 25:26.859
WHERE I FINALLY AGREED
IT WAS SMALLPOX?

25:26.893 --> 25:28.828
WELL, IF WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS REALITY

25:28.861 --> 25:31.698
WAS ACTUALLY A DREAM,
THEN THE REVERSE...

25:31.731 --> 25:32.665
OH, MY GOD.

25:32.699 --> 25:36.803
I HAD A THREESOME
WITH BEYONCE AND LADY GAGA.

25:36.836 --> 25:39.205
SHE DOESN'T HAVE PUSTULES
ON HER PALMS

25:39.238 --> 25:41.574
OR THE SOLES
OF HER FEET.

25:41.608 --> 25:45.244
THE DAD
DOES HAVE PUSTULES THERE.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.715
SO HOW DOES HE GET SMALLPOX,
BUT IT SKIPS HER?

25:59.325 --> 26:01.728
IF I LEAVE LIKE THAT,
YOU SHOULD FOLLOW.

26:01.761 --> 26:02.929
OH.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.767
WE GAVE IT TO HIM.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.868
WHERE'S CHASE?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.771
YOU DO REALIZE WE DON'T
ALL LIVE TOGETHER, RIGHT?

26:11.804 --> 26:13.806
WELL, THEN JUST--
WE GAVE IT TO HIM.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.743
NO PUSTULES
ON THE DAUGHTER'S PALMS, SO...

26:16.776 --> 26:18.645
(Taub)
SO THEREFORE
YOUR THEORY IS

26:18.678 --> 26:20.046
YOU ASKED ME TO TAKE
THE DAD'S BLOOD,

26:20.079 --> 26:21.748
BUT I ACCIDENTALLY
INJECTED HIM

26:21.781 --> 26:23.650
WITH SMALLPOX.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.618
EXACTLY, ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY,
IT WAS THE VACCINIA VIRUS,

26:25.652 --> 26:28.287
WHICH IS WHAT THE SMALLPOX
VACCINE IS MADE FROM.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.056
SAME SYMPTOMS AS SMALLPOX,

26:30.089 --> 26:32.324
BUT ONLY HALF THE CALORIES AND
ALMOST NONE OF THE LETHALITY.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.126
YOU SOUND LIKE ONE
OF THOSE ANTI-VACCINE CRANKS.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.662
YOU CAN'T DEVELOP
FULL-BLOWN SYMPTOMS

26:35.695 --> 26:36.829
FROM THE VACCINE
THIS QUICKLY.

26:36.863 --> 26:39.799
YOU CAN IF YOU'RE
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.701
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO READS THESE THINGS?

26:41.734 --> 26:44.637
DAD HAD KIDNEY CANCER.
SIX YEARS AGO.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.673
HE'S BEEN IN REMISSION.
WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY BACK.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.140
SHOT HIS IMMUNE SYSTEM,

26:48.174 --> 26:49.942
MADE HIM VULNERABLE
TO THE VACCINIA,

26:49.976 --> 26:51.778
WHICH WILL GET BETTER
ON INTERFERON.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.113
SO IF HE RESPONDS
TO THE TREATMENT,

26:54.146 --> 26:56.148
THAT PROVES
HE DOESN'T HAVE SMALLPOX.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.684
THEN WHAT DOES
THE DAUGHTER HAVE?

26:57.717 --> 27:00.186
DAMN. I WAS HOPING
YOU WEREN'T GONNA ASK ME THAT.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.988
CAN WE PLEASE JUST FOCUS

27:02.021 --> 27:06.826
ON THE DISEASE WE JUST DIAGNOSED
AND CAN TREAT?

27:06.859 --> 27:08.695
WHAT'S MORE LIKELY--
HE GOT SMALLPOX

27:08.728 --> 27:10.362
THE DAY AFTER
WE IMMUNIZED HIM FOR IT,

27:10.396 --> 27:12.331
OR HE'S SICK
FROM THE VACCINE ITSELF?

27:12.364 --> 27:14.667
YOU GOT ANY PROOF
THE KIDNEY CANCER IS BACK?

27:14.701 --> 27:15.702
WELL, LET ME GIVE HIM THIS.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.370
WHEN HE GETS BETTER,
THAT'LL BE THE PROOF YOU NEED.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.039
I'LL PUT ON ONE
OF YOUR FANCY SPACESUITS,

27:20.072 --> 27:21.874
AND I PROMISE I WON'T KISS HIM
ON AN OPEN SORE.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.343
YOU KNOW
WHO JANET PARKER IS?

27:24.376 --> 27:26.713
IN 1978,

27:26.746 --> 27:29.048
SHE WAS WORKING
AT A UNIVERSITY IN ENGLAND.

27:29.081 --> 27:32.151
SOMEONE IN A RESEARCH LAB
ON THE FLOOR BELOW SCREWED UP.

27:32.184 --> 27:36.088
SOME SMALLPOX VIRUS MANAGED
TO FLOAT UP THROUGH THE VENTS

27:36.122 --> 27:38.891
INTO THE ROOM
WHERE SHE WAS WORKING.

27:38.925 --> 27:41.794
SHE DIED
FOUR DAYS LATER--

27:41.828 --> 27:43.963
THE LAST KNOWN PERSON
TO DIE FROM SMALLPOX.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.298
AND THE PERSON
IN CHARGE OF THE LAB

27:46.332 --> 27:50.169
WAS SO DESTROYED,
HE KILLED HIMSELF.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.072
NOW THAT HE'S SHEDDING,

27:53.105 --> 27:55.842
I CAN'T OPEN THAT DOOR
FOR ANYONE.

27:58.845 --> 27:59.645
HEY!

27:59.678 --> 28:01.881
LOOK, THERE'S
THE PROOF YOU NEED.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.183
THERE'S BLOOD
IN THE URINE BAG.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.818
HIS KIDNEYS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.286
HE'S IN THE FINAL STAGES
OF THE DISEASE.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.355
IF SMALLPOX WAS CAUSING
THE KIDNEY FAILURE,

28:09.388 --> 28:10.823
THE BLOOD WOULD BE BROWN.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.725
IT'S RED BECAUSE
THE KIDNEY CANCER IS BACK,

28:12.759 --> 28:15.327
AND THIS IS NOT SMALLPOX.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.765
I'M NOT OPENING
THAT DOOR.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.402
[air hissing]

28:23.435 --> 28:24.937
WELL, THAT MAKES ONE OF US.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.705
HEY!

28:28.841 --> 28:30.777
HEY!
YOU'RE INSANE!

28:30.810 --> 28:31.778
BUT I'M RIGHT.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.152
[intercom clicks]
I HOPE YOU ARE,

28:40.186 --> 28:43.189
BECAUSE I CAN'T LET YOU
OUT NOW.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.290
[intercom clicks]

28:53.800 --> 28:54.967
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

28:55.001 --> 28:56.903
WHEN YOU HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR AUTHORITY,

28:56.936 --> 28:58.838
NO RESPECT
FOR ANYTHING.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.773
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S A LITTLE MUCH

29:00.807 --> 29:01.974
TO USE THE THREAT OF DEATH

29:02.008 --> 29:04.977
TO WIN A TOTALLY SEPARATE
ARGUMENT WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

29:05.011 --> 29:07.780
YOU THINK THIS IS
ABOUT THE OTHER THING?

29:07.814 --> 29:10.382
DOES SEEM TO TRACK
SUSPICIOUSLY CLOSELY.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.052
I DON'T CARE RIGHT NOW
THAT YOU LIED TO ME.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.254
I WANT YOU TO STAY ALIVE.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.324
AND IF I DO, DOES THAT MEAN
I WIN BOTH ARGUMENTS?

29:18.357 --> 29:20.860
PUT THE SUIT ON.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.962
[whining]
IT'S UNNECESSARY, MOM.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.997
THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT
THEM TELLING YOU.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.432
IT'S WHY I'M GLAD
THEY DIDN'T TELL WILSON.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.100
(Lulu)
DR. HOUSE.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.012
I'M GETTING WORSE,
AREN'T I?

29:47.987 --> 29:50.389
INTERFERON TAKES
A LITTLE TIME TO WORK.

29:53.893 --> 29:54.961
DON'T WORRY.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.568
TELL BRODA

30:02.601 --> 30:04.503
THAT I'M INCREASING
HIS OXYGEN.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.273
AND GET MY TEAM DOWN HERE.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.890
HI.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.593
YOU'RE MAD AT US,
AREN'T YOU?

30:27.626 --> 30:29.862
YEAH.
WELL, YOU HAVE
A RIGHT TO BE.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.864
WE WEREN'T HONEST.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.632
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW
THIS YET,

30:33.665 --> 30:36.936
BUT SOMETIMES
ADULTS MESS UP.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.007
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING,

30:41.040 --> 30:44.911
AND YOU KEEP IT
JUST BETWEEN US?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.913
I'M NOT GREAT WITH KIDS.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.148
I LOVE THEM,
BUT I GET SCARED

30:49.181 --> 30:51.050
THAT I'M GONNA DO
THE WRONG THING,

30:51.083 --> 30:53.652
AND THEN...
I USUALLY DO.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.489
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID
WITH THE LYING.

30:57.523 --> 31:01.227
AND I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.331
THE REASON WHY
I DID THE WRONG THING

31:05.364 --> 31:07.266
WAS BECAUSE
I WAS TRYING TO GET YOU

31:07.299 --> 31:10.402
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.172
YOUR MOMMY AND YOUR LAMBY

31:13.205 --> 31:17.043
BOTH REALLY NEED YOU
TO GET BETTER.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.911
SO...

31:18.945 --> 31:21.413
DO YOU THINK THAT...

31:21.447 --> 31:25.084
YOU COULD BE
REALLY BRAVE...

31:25.117 --> 31:26.986
AND DO THE RIGHT THING?

31:30.022 --> 31:30.957
I'LL TRY.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.660
GREAT.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.097
GREAT.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.003
(Chase)
FEVER'S WAY UP.
SAT'S WAY DOWN.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.137
PUSTULES STILL SPREADING.

31:45.171 --> 31:46.672
(Masters)
INTERFERON'S NOT WORKING.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.008
(Foreman)
WHICH MEANS THIS IS SMALLPOX.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.142
RIGHT!

31:50.176 --> 31:52.144
'CAUSE THERE ARE ONLY
TWO DISEASES

31:52.178 --> 31:54.580
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD--
WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.148
(Masters)
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.117
(Foreman)
NO, THERE DOESN'T.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.452
THERE ARE STILL NO PUSTULES
ON HER FEET.

32:00.486 --> 32:03.122
ALL THE REASONS YOU THOUGHT
IT WASN'T SMALLPOX STILL EXIST.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.557
(Foreman)
FORGET HER FEET.
FORGET ALL THOSE OTHER REASONS.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.494
LOOK AT HIM NOW.
THE POX ARE DOME-SHAPED.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.397
THEY'RE ON 80% OF HIS BODY,
AND THEY'RE NOT SCABBING OVER.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.566
THIS IS TEXTBOOK SMALLPOX.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.203
DDX'ING AT THIS POINT
ISN'T GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.039
DON'T SAY THAT.
I'M SORRY.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.043
HOUSE...

32:24.076 --> 32:26.312
YOU SCREWED UP
GOING IN THERE.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.995
YOU HAVE ANY FEVER?

32:43.029 --> 32:45.231
NOT YET.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.233
BUT WHEN IT DOES COME,

32:47.266 --> 32:49.168
I ASSUME YOU'LL SEE
THE PETTINESS

32:49.201 --> 32:51.637
OF BEING MAD AT ME
FOR LYING.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.605
SHUT UP, HOUSE.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.042
[alarms beep,
Niles moans]

32:58.577 --> 33:02.148
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.024
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT,
AM I?

33:23.135 --> 33:25.704
YOU SHOULD SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR FAMILY.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.239
I LOVE YOU.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.241
JUST HOLD ON.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.809
FIGHT THIS.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.713
YOU GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF MY BOY.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.684
NO.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.154
PROMISE ME.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.325
I PROMISE.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.232
I LOVE YOU.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.400
I LOVE YOU TOO.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.070
GET ROGER CLOSER.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.606
COME CLOSER.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.842
COME ON.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.812
DAD.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.184
MY BABY BOY.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.787
DAD, PLEASE...

34:48.820 --> 34:51.657
(Niles)
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.460
LULU'S GONNA
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.827
I DON'T WANT HER, DAD.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.463
SHE'S NOT YOU.

35:02.168 --> 35:05.737
I WILL ALWAYS
LOVE YOU, ROGER.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.707
[exhales weakly]

35:08.740 --> 35:10.376
[flatline tone]

35:10.409 --> 35:11.643
DAD?

35:14.913 --> 35:16.782
[no audio]

36:25.317 --> 36:26.785
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

36:26.818 --> 36:28.254
THE SUIT WILL PROTECT YOU

36:28.287 --> 36:30.922
IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY
BEEN EXPOSED.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.292
MY AIR SUPPLY'S
ALMOST OUT.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.560
WE'LL GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CANISTER.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.795
YEAH, AND WHEN I CHANGE IT,
I WILL BE EXPOSED.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.264
JUST MOVE HIM!

36:38.297 --> 36:39.565
I WISH I COULD.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.267
OH, THAT'S GREAT,

36:41.300 --> 36:42.901
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN DO?

36:42.934 --> 36:44.436
YOU CAN MOVE ME.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.705
YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT I HAVE SMALLPOX YET.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.274
WE HAVE TO ASSUME.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.442
THERE'S ANOTHER ISOLATION ROOM
ON THE FIFTH FLOOR.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.844
THE PROBLEM IS GETTING HIM
FROM HERE TO THERE.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.280
SO IT'S INCONVENIENT.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.947
MY HAVING
A FIGHTING CHANCE AT LIFE

36:55.981 --> 36:57.583
IS INCONVENIENT!

37:00.286 --> 37:01.287
I'M SORRY.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.427
WE DON'T KNOW
THAT HE'LL CATCH IT.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.596
WE DON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S DEFINITELY SMALLPOX,

37:10.629 --> 37:13.299
NOT UNTIL WE GET THE DNA RESULTS
BACK FROM THE CDC.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.966
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE DAD JUST DIED OF?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.336
WOULD IT KILL US
TO TALK IT THROUGH?

37:17.369 --> 37:19.004
KILL US? NO.
SAVE HOUSE? ALSO NO.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.772
(Taub)
EVEN IF BY SOME MIRACLE

37:20.806 --> 37:22.841
IT'S NOT SMALLPOX,
THERE'S NOTHING MORE

37:22.874 --> 37:24.610
FOR US TO GO ON.
THERE'S NO NEW DATA.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.278
AND THERE ISN'T GOING
TO BE ANY--

37:26.312 --> 37:28.480
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO GET MORE DATA.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.852
"GERRITT SEEMS DISTANT

37:33.885 --> 37:35.053
AND PREOCCUPIED."

37:35.086 --> 37:37.323
WHO'S GERRITT?
IS HE A SLAVE?

37:37.356 --> 37:38.990
[chuckles]
GERRITT IS THE CAPTAIN'S KITTY.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.859
THE CAPTAIN'S CAT
IS PREOCCUPIED?

37:40.892 --> 37:42.461
SKIP THE CAT.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.696
UH, "ONE GOAT
SLAUGHTERED FOR DINNER.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.998
BROKE OUT THE NEXT BARREL
OF WINE."

37:47.032 --> 37:48.434
SKIP THE FOOD.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.869
UH, C-CAN WE GO BACK
TO THE CAT?

37:50.902 --> 37:52.471
DID THE CAT GET SICK?

37:52.504 --> 37:54.773
(Taub)
SMALLPOX
IS EXCLUSIVE TO HUMANS.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.608
SHIP CAPTAINS
DIDN'T HAVE PETS.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.344
NOTHING AND NOBODY
WENT ON THOSE SHIPS

37:58.377 --> 37:59.878
IF IT DIDN'T HAVE
A PURPOSE.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.348
HUNTING MICE AND RATS?
FOR THE CREW.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.450
THE HOLD WAS PROBABLY
INFESTED WITH MICE.

38:04.483 --> 38:05.984
WHAT IF THAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?

38:06.017 --> 38:09.788
(Taub)
WHAT HAPPENED TO GERRITT?

38:09.821 --> 38:10.956
AH.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.859
IS THAT A SAD "AH"
OR A CUTE "AH"?

38:13.892 --> 38:16.695
GERRITT, HE DIED.
IT'S A SAD "AH."

38:18.897 --> 38:22.568
BEFORE HE DIED,
DID HE LOSE HIS FUR?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.405
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

38:28.139 --> 38:29.375
MICE DON'T CARRY SMALLPOX,

38:29.408 --> 38:31.343
BUT THEY DO CARRY
RICKETTSIALPOX.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.078
WHICH IS TREATABLE.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.949
JUST START THEM
ON DOXYCYCLINE.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.118
BASED ON A BALD CAT?
YOU NEVER HEARD OF SHEDDING?

38:40.151 --> 38:41.687
WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE?

38:41.720 --> 38:44.122
IF WE SHOVE HER FULL OF
ANTIBIOTICS PLUS THE ANTIVIRALS,

38:44.155 --> 38:45.491
IT'LL SUPPRESS
HER BONE MARROW.

38:45.524 --> 38:46.958
THAT GIRL'S
ABOUT TO DIE.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.026
SHE PROBABLY IS,

38:48.059 --> 38:51.096
AND I DON'T WANT TO RISK
PUSHING HER OVER THE EDGE.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.664
AT LEAST LOOK
AT THE DAD'S BODY.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.934
SMALL PATCHES OF BLACK, DEAD
TISSUE WILL PROVE I'M RIGHT.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.937
ESCHARS APPEAR
WITH RICKETTSIALPOX

38:58.970 --> 39:00.038
BUT NOT WITH SMALLPOX.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.874
IF HE HAD DEVELOPED ESCHARS,
I WOULD HAVE NOTICED.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.010
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WITHIN 20 FEET
OF THE GUY IN HOURS.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.112
HAVE THEM CHECK.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.547
THEIR JOB
IS TO BLEACH THE BODY,

39:08.580 --> 39:09.948
KILL THE VIRUS,

39:09.981 --> 39:11.583
AND GET IT OUT OF THERE
FOR DR. HOUSE'S SAKE.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.018
BLEACHING THE BODY

39:13.051 --> 39:16.154
WILL DESTROY ALL EVIDENCE
OF RICKETTSIALPOX.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.089
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE!

39:18.123 --> 39:20.158
I'M NOT TRYING TO HURT
ANYONE HERE.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.160
I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.563
THIS IS SMALLPOX.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.407
[intercom clicks]

39:35.441 --> 39:37.443
HOUSE, YOU HAVE
TO EXAMINE THE BODY.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.144
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR IT.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.447
LOOK FOR ESCHARS.
HURRY.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.949
YOU THINK IT'S R-POX?

39:43.982 --> 39:45.083
THE CAPTAIN HAD A CAT.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.085
HE LOST HIS FUR
AND THEN DIED.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.465
STEP BACK, DR. HOUSE.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.709
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO DO
AN AUTOPSY IN OVEN MITTS.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.943
TAKE THEM OFF.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.144
SAYS THE WOMAN

40:13.178 --> 40:15.013
STANDING BEHIND
TWO PANES OF GLASS.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.214
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

40:16.247 --> 40:17.949
FORGET ME.
DO YOU BELIEVE YOU?

40:17.983 --> 40:20.819
YOU THINK IT'S RICKETTSIALPOX,
DON'T YOU?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.053
IF IT IS, IT'S CURABLE,

40:22.087 --> 40:24.189
AND SHE'S GONNA DIE
UNLESS WE CAN PROVE IT.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.029
YOU REALLY ARE ANNOYING.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.647
COME ON, HOUSE.
COME ON.

40:57.523 --> 40:58.824
ESCHAR.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.563
ESCHARS.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.175
START THE GIRL
ON DOXYCYCLINE RIGHT NOW.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.028
MOMMY!

41:40.131 --> 41:42.233
(Wilson)
YOU WERE GOOD WITH HER.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.102
YEAH, ONLY AFTER
BEING BAD.

41:44.135 --> 41:46.137
IT TAKES PRACTICE.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.107
MAYBE I SHOULD GET
A PUPPY.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.678
YEAH, OR...
PREGNANT?

42:00.351 --> 42:02.754
HEY.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.593
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.132
HEY.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.767
HEY.

42:29.948 --> 42:33.118
BUY YOU BREAKFAST?
NO, THANKS.

42:33.151 --> 42:34.886
YOU CAN PAY...

42:34.920 --> 42:37.188
IF IT'S STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE I'M CARRYING YOU.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.157
HOUSE, STOP.

42:42.661 --> 42:45.230
WHEN I WAS DYING...

42:45.263 --> 42:48.366
YOU REALIZED THAT A LITTLE
WHITE LIE BETWEEN COWORKERS

42:48.399 --> 42:50.168
WASN'T SUCH A BIG DEAL.

42:50.201 --> 42:53.204
YEAH, AND THAT
WAS TRUE...

42:53.238 --> 42:55.273
WHEN YOU WERE DYING.
