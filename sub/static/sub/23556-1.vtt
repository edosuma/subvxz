12:12.866 --> 12:15.066

first king.

send this to us?

to put it in the museum?

Yes.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.366
Definitely an astronaut.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.694
You need to stall them!
What, who?

42:11.796 --> 42:12.795
Didn't you hear
the doorbell?

42:12.898 --> 42:13.796
It's the cops.

42:13.899 --> 42:14.931
(doorbell ringing continues)
5-0.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.332
You need to stall them.
Now?!

42:16.434 --> 42:17.967
Yes, now, we don't have
time for questions!

42:18.069 --> 42:19.135
Come on, let's go!

42:21.740 --> 42:23.439
Uh, hi!

42:23.542 --> 42:24.607
Hi, Anika.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.109
Everything okay here?

42:26.211 --> 42:27.176
Yup, uh-huh.

42:28.980 --> 42:29.946
Can we come in?

42:30.048 --> 42:31.915
Ah, well, you know,

42:32.017 --> 42:33.583
the reason
I'm so dirty is

42:33.685 --> 42:36.452
we're having,
uh, problems

42:36.555 --> 42:38.187
with, uh...

42:38.290 --> 42:39.222
ceilings.

42:40.191 --> 42:41.224
The ceilings.

42:41.326 --> 42:42.225
Yeah.

42:42.327 --> 42:43.326
Yeah, it's really
dangerous.

42:43.428 --> 42:44.827
They're falling down,

42:44.930 --> 42:46.162
so you should
come back later.

42:46.264 --> 42:47.597
Okay, enough
with this nonsense.

42:47.699 --> 42:48.831
Now let us in,
little girl.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.736
Guys, we've got company!

42:59.411 --> 43:00.643
Oh no.

43:00.745 --> 43:01.811
What do we do?
