WEBVTT

00:00.568 --> 00:02.415
Okay where were we?

00:02.415 --> 00:04.362
It was June of 2006,

00:04.362 --> 00:06.659
and life had just taken
an unexpected turn.

00:06.659 --> 00:09.729
Dad, can't you just skip ahead
to the part where you meet Mom?

00:09.729 --> 00:12.084
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year.

00:12.336 --> 00:14.700
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.

00:14.789 --> 00:16.226
It's all part of the story.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.287
- Could I go to the bathroom?
- No.

00:19.338 --> 00:23.426
The summer of 2006
was both wonderful and awful.

00:23.905 --> 00:25.490
For me, it started out great.

00:25.512 --> 00:27.529
In fact, day one was amazing.

00:27.607 --> 00:29.783
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.

00:30.296 --> 00:33.363
But while I'd been off having
one of the best nights of my life,

00:34.587 --> 00:37.672
your uncle Marshall had been having
one of the worst nights of his.

00:41.307 --> 00:42.423
So that's it?

00:42.597 --> 00:43.681
We're breaking up?

00:44.355 --> 00:46.180
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...

00:46.456 --> 00:49.470
I just need to go to San Francisco
and do this art program and

00:49.475 --> 00:52.420
-and figure out who I am outside of us.

00:53.205 --> 00:55.790
And the only way
that I can do that is if...

00:56.655 --> 00:58.663
if we don't talk for a while.

00:59.457 --> 01:00.553
For a while.

01:01.485 --> 01:03.232
Try never, okay?

01:03.505 --> 01:06.041
You walk out that door,
and we're done.

01:06.307 --> 01:08.730
You're never going
to hear my voice again.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.431
I should call her.

01:10.436 --> 01:11.900
- No, No.
- Ted it is--

01:11.905 --> 01:14.221
If you call her when she asked you not to
you're just going to look weak

01:14.226 --> 01:15.530
and you're going to regret it.

01:15.595 --> 01:19.451
Now, listen, whenever you feel like
calling her, you come find me first.

01:20.008 --> 01:21.910
And I will punch you in the face.

01:22.796 --> 01:24.352
You're a good friend, Ted.

01:26.306 --> 01:27.682
Hey.

01:27.848 --> 01:29.013
So, did you hear the big news?

01:29.017 --> 01:31.192
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up,

01:31.197 --> 01:34.691
and Lily's gone and nothing else
even remotely important happened last night,

01:34.697 --> 01:36.432
yeah, I think he knows.

01:36.457 --> 01:37.723
Oh, my God.

01:37.877 --> 01:39.913
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--

01:39.916 --> 01:41.072
What happened?

01:41.307 --> 01:43.143
Well, she left.

01:43.147 --> 01:45.760
And I don't even know
if she's coming back.

01:46.085 --> 01:47.871
I didn't get your message until I woke up.

01:48.257 --> 01:50.460
- Bro, I am so sorry.
- Thanks.

01:50.598 --> 01:52.140
I know it must be tough,

01:52.146 --> 01:55.422
but are you ready to hear something
that will not only make you feel better,

01:55.426 --> 01:57.452
but will actively excite you?

01:57.455 --> 01:58.663
Sure.

01:59.005 --> 02:04.981
For the first time, ever, the three of us
are single at the same time.

02:05.305 --> 02:10.009
I've dreamed about this day, boys,
and it's going to be legendary.

02:10.156 --> 02:12.701
Together, we will own this city.

02:13.106 --> 02:17.141
Anytime a girl wants to get back
at her ex-boyfriends,

02:17.147 --> 02:18.720
we'll be there.

02:18.956 --> 02:22.620
Anytime a girl wants
to solve her father issues

02:22.627 --> 02:26.801
through promiscuity and binge drinking,
we will be there.

02:27.758 --> 02:31.203
Anytime a bachelorette party
drives through the city in a limo,

02:31.207 --> 02:33.282
sticking their heads out
the sunroof shouting,

02:33.287 --> 02:34.823
"What's up, New York?"

02:34.908 --> 02:38.112
we will be what is up New York.

02:38.907 --> 02:41.582
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...

02:46.385 --> 02:48.943
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?

03:04.637 --> 03:07.503
One thing I learned that summer
is that when love is beginning...

03:10.356 --> 03:14.783
...and love is ending,
the first 30 days are remarkably similar.

03:15.846 --> 03:18.392
For one thing,
you spend most of your time in bed.

03:23.408 --> 03:25.422
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.

03:29.207 --> 03:31.131
It was a really beautiful song.

03:32.107 --> 03:35.312
So... stupid, man.

03:36.005 --> 03:37.901
And you never seem to wear pants.

03:43.006 --> 03:46.002
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.

03:46.146 --> 03:47.271
You hungry?

03:47.358 --> 03:49.090
What's the point?
I could eat some food.

03:49.097 --> 03:51.051
It's just going to leave me.

03:51.377 --> 03:54.072
Well, at least in that scenario
you get to do the dumping.

03:55.366 --> 03:57.871
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.

03:58.007 --> 04:00.551
Lily always made the pancakes.

04:01.086 --> 04:03.181
God, I loved her pancakes.

04:03.245 --> 04:06.120
So soft.
So warm.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.213
So perfectly shaped.

04:08.775 --> 04:10.770
Are we still talking about her pancakes?

04:11.955 --> 04:14.232
Come on, you got to eat something;
what can I get you?

04:14.408 --> 04:16.940
- Beer.
- No, that's what you had for dinner.

04:17.158 --> 04:18.392
Fine.

04:18.575 --> 04:20.582
Then I'll just have leftovers.

04:23.005 --> 04:26.303
So, he stays home all the time
not getting laid?

04:26.407 --> 04:29.270
No, see, that's what you do
when you have a fiancÃ©e.

04:29.605 --> 04:32.373
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.943
He got that redheaded tumor removed.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.910
You should write
and illustrate children's books.

04:38.955 --> 04:40.331
You know what Marshall needs to do.

04:40.335 --> 04:42.821
He needs to stop being sad.

04:43.268 --> 04:47.000
When I get sad, I stop being sad
and be awesome instead.

04:47.857 --> 04:48.900
True story.

04:49.807 --> 04:51.523
It's only been a month.

04:51.605 --> 04:53.121
He just needs to go at his own pace.

04:53.128 --> 04:55.331
Anyway, Lily's the one
who caused this whole mess.

04:55.335 --> 04:56.893
Hey, cut her some slack.

04:56.898 --> 04:59.761
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.

04:59.765 --> 05:00.962
Figure out who she is?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.982
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.

05:02.987 --> 05:05.970
She's selfish.
She's immature. She's...

05:06.806 --> 05:07.471
What?

05:07.878 --> 05:10.100
God, your eyes are so blue.

05:11.307 --> 05:13.242
Teddy Bear.

05:16.258 --> 05:18.222
Oh that's a...

05:26.307 --> 05:28.121
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.

05:28.207 --> 05:31.672
I was dating the woman of my dreams,
and things were going great.

05:31.955 --> 05:33.122
Well, for the most part.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.030
So, I found her shampoo.

05:35.186 --> 05:36.550
I guess she left it here.

05:37.015 --> 05:38.432
It smells like her.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.971
Like lavender and seashells and hope.

05:47.028 --> 05:51.462
Somehow, erotic and comforting
all at the same time.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.331
That's my shampoo.

05:55.385 --> 05:57.130
Oh, sorry.

05:57.347 --> 05:59.682
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.

06:01.537 --> 06:03.492
- Uh-oh.
- Already?

06:05.677 --> 06:06.893
He's calling her.

06:06.898 --> 06:09.810
- I don't hear any--
- He's calling her.

06:10.008 --> 06:11.073
No.

06:12.308 --> 06:15.133
Okay, you're right,
I won't call her.

06:15.338 --> 06:17.423
I will not call her.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.543
Well, I called her.

06:19.878 --> 06:23.150
And get this, she changed her number.

06:23.158 --> 06:25.193
What, like I'm going to stalk her,
or something?

06:25.195 --> 06:27.193
Like she's so special.

06:27.195 --> 06:29.152
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.

06:29.308 --> 06:32.071
'Cause there are four others
in the San Francisco area alone,

06:32.075 --> 06:34.013
and they all seem a lot better than her

06:34.016 --> 06:36.531
based on the brief conversations
I had with them.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.662
- Does he know I'm in here?
- Yeah, hey, Robin.

06:39.937 --> 06:43.003
- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...
- This has to stop.

06:43.107 --> 06:44.821
Ted, we just started dating.

06:44.825 --> 06:46.550
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,

06:46.555 --> 06:48.482
and yet somehow, we have a baby.

06:48.687 --> 06:50.230
He can't feed himself.

06:50.235 --> 06:53.993
- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
- Have you tried breast-feeding?

06:54.257 --> 06:55.273
Nailed it!

06:55.557 --> 06:58.150
Look, they were together nine years.

06:58.157 --> 06:59.921
It's only been a month and a half.

06:59.985 --> 07:01.660
He just needs to go at his own pace.

07:01.687 --> 07:04.153
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.

07:04.155 --> 07:08.123
- He watched a scary movie.
- It is time for some tough love.

07:08.212 --> 07:10.007
We need to get him out of that apartment.

07:10.007 --> 07:12.563
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.993
Mmm, sunshine.

07:15.427 --> 07:19.110
Gentlemen, please welcome
to the stage, Sunshine.

07:23.606 --> 07:25.821
All right, I really don't think
this is going to help.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.591
Do you know why
you're not over Lily yet?

07:28.595 --> 07:30.753
It's 'cause you can still
picture her naked.

07:30.757 --> 07:33.922
You can't get over a woman until
you can no longer picture her boobs;

07:33.928 --> 07:35.200
it's a scientific fact.

07:35.205 --> 07:41.461
The average male brain can only store
a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".

07:41.738 --> 07:44.843
And your hard drive's
filled to capacity with Lily's.

07:46.097 --> 07:47.402
There are a lot of them.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.842
Well, they won't go away
until you overwrite them

07:49.845 --> 07:51.571
with images of other women's boobs.

07:51.576 --> 07:55.521
Now, this journey may take
as many as a million boobs,

07:55.526 --> 07:57.923
so we begin here tonight, my friend.

07:58.035 --> 07:59.393
Two at a time.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.511
Those count as four.

08:06.308 --> 08:07.171
Yeah.

08:07.507 --> 08:10.131
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.

08:10.235 --> 08:12.072
The Indians are winning.

08:12.806 --> 08:15.100
I got to admit,
it is really nice to be outside.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.923
Yankee fans, please turn your attention
to the Diamond Vision for a special

08:18.928 --> 08:21.580
- seventh-inning-stretch surprise
- Oh, no.

08:29.956 --> 08:31.852
It's all a big lie!

08:32.006 --> 08:34.111
She's just going to break your heart.

08:36.258 --> 08:39.653
You can drag me out of here,
but she has no soul!

08:39.658 --> 08:42.260
We've tried everything--
baseball, strippers.

08:42.268 --> 08:44.340
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.

08:44.347 --> 08:46.011
I think he's beyond repair.

08:46.116 --> 08:47.903
See, this is the problem with guys.

08:47.908 --> 08:49.530
You don't know
how to deal with heartbreak.

08:49.535 --> 08:52.172
Oh, and what's your prescription,
Dr. Estrogen?

08:52.178 --> 08:55.881
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually,
till your periods sync up.

09:02.206 --> 09:04.172
Yeah, that's the stuff.

09:04.506 --> 09:05.742
Oh, my God.

09:06.006 --> 09:07.411
How long have you been doing this?

09:07.458 --> 09:09.791
Well, my dad taught me to shoot
when I was a kid.

09:09.807 --> 09:12.330
Whenever I'm feeling lonely
or depressed, I come here,

09:12.337 --> 09:15.723
and it reminds me that... guns are fun.

09:20.008 --> 09:23.011
Um, you know,
Ted is kind of against guns.

09:23.217 --> 09:25.862
And that's why
Ted's never going to find out about this.

09:26.557 --> 09:29.751
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary
with me holding a gun, didn't it?

09:29.757 --> 09:32.120
No, I-I just mean, please don't tell Ted.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.950
You want to try?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.452
Only hell yeah.

09:37.095 --> 09:39.561
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.

09:40.037 --> 09:43.310
I felt so powerless this whole time,
but this...

09:44.267 --> 09:46.712
this is power.
This is...

09:49.456 --> 09:51.243
I should of mentioned the recoil.

09:51.705 --> 09:54.723
I got to hand it to you, when he got home,
Marshall was smiling--

09:54.727 --> 09:56.011
did you sleep with him?

09:56.128 --> 09:58.861
'Cause I was actually, like,
three days away from suggesting that.

09:58.865 --> 10:02.211
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch
with your feminine side.

10:05.106 --> 10:08.250
- Yeah, yeah!
- Well, congratulations.

10:08.258 --> 10:10.413
You're the first person
to cheer him up all summer.

10:10.488 --> 10:12.171
- You win.
- Oh, what do I win?

10:12.307 --> 10:14.462
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.

10:14.468 --> 10:16.423
You are?
That's so nice.

10:16.428 --> 10:18.491
Yeah, my aunt and uncle
have a beach house out in Montauk,

10:18.496 --> 10:19.921
oh, it's really romantic.

10:20.035 --> 10:21.942
My uncle's had like three affairs there.

10:22.117 --> 10:25.790
Wow, must be a nice house,
I've seen pictures of your uncle.

10:27.405 --> 10:28.632
This is going to be so great.

10:28.635 --> 10:30.422
We'll finally get some time alone.

10:30.875 --> 10:32.832
Are you sure Marshall's
going to be okay with this?

10:32.835 --> 10:35.993
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.812
In fact, take my car.

10:37.816 --> 10:38.812
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:38.816 --> 10:40.572
Hey, thanks... and, hey,

10:40.576 --> 10:42.872
if you need anything day or night,
just call me--

10:42.877 --> 10:44.693
You know what, please don't call me.

10:45.908 --> 10:47.271
What? What's wrong?

10:47.827 --> 10:49.672
It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.

10:50.046 --> 10:51.970
She must have forgotten
to switch her address.

10:51.975 --> 10:52.743
So?

10:53.526 --> 10:56.452
So, I wonder what kind of charges
she's making out there in San Francisco.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.661
No. No, no good can come
from looking at this.

10:58.665 --> 11:00.912
- You've made too much progress already.
- I know but I just, maybe the--

11:00.915 --> 11:01.742
No!

11:02.786 --> 11:04.390
You're going to thank me for this.

11:07.506 --> 11:09.441
You're a good friend, Ted.

11:10.995 --> 11:13.583
August 5th, one charge-- tickets.

11:13.588 --> 11:17.673
To what? George Clinton
and the P-Funk All-Stars.

11:17.676 --> 11:20.552
August 10th, one charge: Tennis Emporium.

11:20.906 --> 11:25.032
August 18th, two charges: Mario's Bistro

11:25.037 --> 11:27.911
and, get this, Pet Palace.

11:29.408 --> 11:31.152
You guys see what this means, right?

11:33.907 --> 11:36.200
Wow, Mario's Bistro.

11:36.267 --> 11:39.112
What a perfect place to whore around.

11:39.208 --> 11:41.671
Only the best for my little Lily pad.

11:42.558 --> 11:47.062
Oh, funk legend George Clinton,
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert

11:47.067 --> 11:50.791
and dragged me on stage to dance
with you Courtney Cox-style.

11:50.926 --> 11:53.532
And I'm so glad you agreed
to play tennis with me.

11:54.766 --> 11:58.123
You know, Marshall tried to get me
to play tennis for nine years,

11:58.127 --> 12:01.572
but I didn't do it,
because I never truly loved him.

12:02.745 --> 12:04.103
I got you a gift.

12:06.608 --> 12:07.921
Oh ! A ferret.

12:07.926 --> 12:11.781
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door
at the Pet Palace.

12:12.007 --> 12:14.432
Oh, I've always wanted one,

12:14.438 --> 12:17.382
but Marshall had
this secret phobia of ferrets.

12:17.387 --> 12:20.281
I bet that's something
he made you promise not to tell nobody.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.901
It was.

12:22.665 --> 12:23.661
Oh.

12:23.668 --> 12:26.491
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.512
I love you, too, Lily.

12:28.897 --> 12:31.163
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.

12:31.386 --> 12:32.912
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.

12:32.916 --> 12:34.810
# Ow, we want the funk. #

12:35.426 --> 12:36.842
# Give up the funk... #

12:36.905 --> 12:38.723
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

12:38.728 --> 12:41.370
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.

12:41.408 --> 12:44.430
Because, Robin,
they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.252
Plus, those charges are from,
like, a month ago.

12:47.258 --> 12:47.892
Exactly.

12:47.895 --> 12:50.050
For new charges,
you have to go to her online account.

12:50.216 --> 12:53.270
You can see credit card activity from,
like, two hours ago.

12:55.237 --> 12:57.581
But, you know, don't.

12:59.975 --> 13:02.602
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?!

13:03.455 --> 13:05.480
He needs her password.
It's not like he has her password.

13:05.496 --> 13:07.381
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.

13:07.785 --> 13:12.272
There's a charge from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.

13:13.297 --> 13:16.253
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.602
I can't believe this.

13:21.606 --> 13:23.280
Lily's in New York?

13:23.608 --> 13:26.603
I-I guess I've been thinking
when she got back, she'd call me.

13:27.088 --> 13:30.473
That's really the only reason I've been able
to hold it together so far this summer.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.411
This has been "holding it together"?

13:33.597 --> 13:34.832
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.

13:34.836 --> 13:36.132
- No.
- Ted, give me the phone.

13:36.138 --> 13:37.513
You're not calling her,
this changes nothing.

13:37.516 --> 13:38.831
You, come here.

13:40.006 --> 13:42.541
Look, while we're away this weekend,
can you keep an eye on him,

13:42.548 --> 13:44.102
make sure he doesn't call that hotel?

13:44.126 --> 13:45.450
You want me to babysit him?

13:45.748 --> 13:46.860
20 bucks.

13:47.197 --> 13:48.081
An hour.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.383
And money for pizza.

13:49.385 --> 13:53.013
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or
every time we hang out, you have to watch this?

13:53.017 --> 13:53.830
Come here.

13:53.838 --> 13:56.733
- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.
- Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...

13:58.006 --> 14:00.460
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.

14:01.287 --> 14:03.092
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall!

14:03.097 --> 14:04.910
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this,
but I have to!

14:04.916 --> 14:05.553
- You call her...
- We were together...

14:05.557 --> 14:06.842
- for nine years!
- ...and everything we've been working so hard for

14:06.846 --> 14:08.111
is completely flushed down the toi...

14:08.286 --> 14:10.152
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.

14:11.247 --> 14:12.220
Thank you.

14:12.905 --> 14:14.040
- Hang up now.
- Ted, I can't hang up now.

14:14.045 --> 14:14.942
- Hang up now.
- The missiles are in the air,

14:14.948 --> 14:16.422
- and I know that you don't approve.
- Hang up.

14:16.426 --> 14:17.043
Hello.

14:23.705 --> 14:24.950
Uh, a guy answered.

14:25.708 --> 14:27.603
There's-there's a guy in her room.

14:29.948 --> 14:31.872
- I'm going down there.
- Dude, you can't do that.

14:31.878 --> 14:33.750
I have to go down there,
and I have to tell her I love her;

14:33.758 --> 14:35.232
I have to beg her to take me back,

14:35.238 --> 14:36.612
even if I have to get down on my knees.

14:36.618 --> 14:38.723
- Marshall, you can't do that.
- Oh, really, why not?

14:39.048 --> 14:40.480
56 days.

14:40.485 --> 14:42.940
That's how long it took me
to get right about here.

14:42.946 --> 14:44.890
Because you're pathetic!

14:47.277 --> 14:49.803
I'm sorry, but right now,
you are not Marshall.

14:50.347 --> 14:54.980
You are the miserable, whining,
shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall,

14:54.988 --> 14:58.321
and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have
a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.

14:58.538 --> 15:01.110
You know who might have a shot
somewhere down the line.

15:01.618 --> 15:02.601
Marshall.

15:02.608 --> 15:04.131
The real Marshall.

15:04.138 --> 15:06.003
But if you go down there
right now like this,

15:06.135 --> 15:08.643
you're going to blow it for him,
and he's never going to forgive you.

15:09.898 --> 15:12.193
Of course, whatever I say,
you're just going to do the opposite, so

15:12.196 --> 15:14.732
have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.872
Come on, Robin.

15:20.217 --> 15:22.323
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?

15:24.007 --> 15:26.571
Bold. Bold to go for the car.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.161
What?

15:31.547 --> 15:33.233
I didn't say a thing.

15:33.706 --> 15:35.480
You think I was too hard on him.

15:35.606 --> 15:37.070
I didn't say a thing.

15:37.076 --> 15:39.390
I can't believe you're accusing me
of being too hard on him.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.881
You're the one who said "tough love."

15:40.888 --> 15:43.431
Yeah, tough love,
not "hand the guy a noose."

15:43.437 --> 15:45.563
Oh, but it's okay
to hand him a nine millimeter?

15:46.465 --> 15:48.852
Yeah, he told me.

15:51.168 --> 15:52.631
So you're a gun nut?

15:52.635 --> 15:54.661
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.150
- Do you know how many people...
- The Second Amendment...

15:56.167 --> 15:57.652
- are killed each year in accidents...
- protects my right to bear arms...

15:57.655 --> 15:59.710
All right, all right, all right.

15:59.905 --> 16:01.311
I was too hard on him.

16:02.707 --> 16:03.673
A little.

16:06.896 --> 16:08.763
I'm going to call Barney,
see how they're doing.

16:09.898 --> 16:10.772
Go for Barney.

16:10.777 --> 16:12.103
Oh, hey, where are you guys?

16:12.106 --> 16:15.732
We're at a fundraiser, helping young women
raise money for community college.

16:15.736 --> 16:17.100
Strip club, nice.

16:17.296 --> 16:18.441
Is Marshall okay?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.662
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.

16:20.665 --> 16:22.190
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--

16:23.956 --> 16:24.613
Uh-oh.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.722
Already?

16:26.977 --> 16:28.271
What? What uh-oh?

16:28.277 --> 16:29.692
He's gone.

16:29.756 --> 16:30.893
You lost him?

16:30.898 --> 16:32.931
I can't believe this.
He's gonna go down to that hotel.

16:33.108 --> 16:35.413
Crap, you're right. Okay, okay,
here's the plan, here's the plan.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.502
You go down to the hotel and find him.

16:37.507 --> 16:39.600
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three. One, two...

16:39.606 --> 16:40.471
Barney!

16:45.987 --> 16:48.290
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.062
A really nice one.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.662
Hi, uh, could you tell me
what room Lily Aldrin's in?

16:58.756 --> 16:59.693
Marshall.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.201
Hey.

17:03.205 --> 17:04.333
What happened?

17:04.497 --> 17:07.973
Well, I went up to Lily's floor,

17:07.978 --> 17:09.990
and I had this little speech in my head--

17:09.994 --> 17:14.732
everything I've been wanting to say to her
all summer about love, loyalty, respect.

17:15.008 --> 17:16.381
I knocked on the door.

17:22.726 --> 17:25.211
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?

17:25.218 --> 17:26.109
Yeah.

17:26.397 --> 17:27.911
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.542
What? Who-- who was it?

17:29.547 --> 17:31.411
His name was Joey Adalian,

17:31.417 --> 17:35.023
although he went by a number
of aliases in his years as an identity thief.

17:35.425 --> 17:37.273
Apparently, earlier in the summer...

17:37.636 --> 17:40.733
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

17:40.735 --> 17:43.051
I-I could have sworn I had some change.

17:44.068 --> 17:46.011
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

17:46.806 --> 17:48.213
Oh, here we go.

17:49.007 --> 17:50.703
No, that's-that's a button.

17:50.905 --> 17:52.320
It was a button.

17:55.376 --> 17:58.390
- Do you, uh, take credit cards?
- Yes, I do.

17:59.108 --> 18:02.482
So Lily's not back in town,
and she doesn't have a boyfriend?

18:02.486 --> 18:03.911
Th-That's good news, right?

18:03.917 --> 18:04.790
Yeah.

18:05.908 --> 18:06.981
I don't know.

18:08.028 --> 18:11.693
Those credit card charges were the only
remaining connection I had to her.

18:12.876 --> 18:15.802
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.

18:16.997 --> 18:20.602
She was my whole life, man,
and now she's-she's gone.

18:25.007 --> 18:27.873
You know, first day of college, I showed up,

18:27.877 --> 18:33.172
I was so freaked out, and-and I got up
to my room, and there was my roommate,

18:33.848 --> 18:36.281
lying on the bed
with his feet up on the wall.

18:36.307 --> 18:40.620
Had headphones on, big smile on his face
like he just didn't give a crap.

18:41.507 --> 18:42.472
Happy.

18:42.695 --> 18:43.820
Confident.

18:43.827 --> 18:45.420
Not afraid of anything.

18:46.315 --> 18:47.891
That guy was you.

18:48.305 --> 18:50.382
You before you met Lily.

18:52.547 --> 18:53.490
Ted?

18:53.928 --> 18:54.810
Yeah?

18:55.767 --> 18:57.232
I was high that day.

18:57.756 --> 19:00.381
I was. I was so high,
I thought you were the dean.

19:02.708 --> 19:10.103
Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version
of you without Lily, and it's not this.

19:11.208 --> 19:15.453
You can't let Lily steal your identity
the way that guy stole hers.

19:17.725 --> 19:18.860
Okay.

19:20.186 --> 19:22.252
Okay, resolved.

19:22.708 --> 19:25.941
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to start being okay.

19:26.758 --> 19:28.140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:35.307 --> 19:39.043
But he wasn't,
'cause that's not how life works.

19:39.126 --> 19:41.593
The next day,
he found one of her socks or something,

19:41.597 --> 19:43.383
and we were back to square one.

19:46.105 --> 19:47.863
And then, one morning...

19:47.867 --> 19:50.303
Ted, I think you should see this.

19:51.105 --> 19:52.653
Oh, no, what now?

19:54.505 --> 19:56.991
Marshall, what are you doing?

19:57.708 --> 19:58.652
It's Sunday.

19:59.538 --> 20:00.731
It's pancakes day.

20:05.905 --> 20:10.233
It took him 67 days and
one really disgusting batch of pancakes...

20:15.207 --> 20:16.330
So good.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.090
So good.

20:18.707 --> 20:21.253
...but Marshall
had come back from the dead.

20:21.705 --> 20:24.343
Because while baseball, strippers,
and guns can help,

20:24.647 --> 20:28.440
the only thing that
can really heal a broken heart is time.

20:28.448 --> 20:31.080
# I try to laugh about it #

20:31.088 --> 20:34.633
# Cover it all up with lies #

20:36.266 --> 20:39.471
# I try to laugh about it #

20:39.477 --> 20:43.112
# Hiding the tears from my eyes #

20:43.118 --> 20:49.703
# 'Cause boys don't cry. #
