00:01.752 --> 00:05.131
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.178
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.930
His name, Merlin.

00:16.225 --> 00:20.438
From the moment it touched my lips,
| could feel my life return to me.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.106
UTHER: Cenred is our sworn enemy.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.442
We cannot risk him getting his hands
on the Cup of Life.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.693
Why does Uther fear it so much?

00:25.776 --> 00:28.446
Because the Cup can be used for evil
as well as good.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.156
Not so great Cenred's got it then.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.949
It's worse than you can
possibly imagine.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.367
MORGAUSE: With the Cup
in our possession,

00:33.451 --> 00:35.036
Camelot would soon be at our mercy.

00:35.119 --> 00:39.290
You march with the mightiest weapon
of them all, immortality.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.712
You know I have always been
loyal to you, Morgana.

00:44.795 --> 00:47.215
MORGAUSE: I don't think
you'll be needing this anymore.

00:47.298 --> 00:51.344
-You have no right to the throne!
-No, she does not. But I do.

00:52.470 --> 00:53.930
| am your daughter, after all.

01:14.158 --> 01:18.371
Tell me, Sir Leon, how have you enjoyed
the first week of my reign?

01:22.333 --> 01:23.376
Speak up.

01:25.211 --> 01:27.630
Are you and your fellow knights
ready to honor and serve me?

01:30.007 --> 01:31.217
| would rather die.

01:33.219 --> 01:34.679
That can be arranged.

01:35.972 --> 01:38.474
My loyalty is to the King
and Prince Arthur.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.852
There is nothing you can do
to change that.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.355
We shall see.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.634
(MERLIN PANTING)

02:16.053 --> 02:17.054
I'll get some more.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.973
-It's too dangerous.
-What happened?

02:19.056 --> 02:20.683
Nothing.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.855
(WHISPERS) We need to do something.
Morgana's men are everywhere.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.073
| will give you one more chance
to pledge your allegiance to me.

02:48.294 --> 02:51.422
-Long live the King!
-ALL: Long live the King!

02:53.007 --> 02:55.760
Perhaps this will help you
change your mind.

02:58.721 --> 03:00.431
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

03:01.223 --> 03:02.308
(YELLING) No!

03:38.511 --> 03:39.762
(DOOR OPENING)

03:44.642 --> 03:46.852
-Father.
-Why are you doing this?

03:46.936 --> 03:49.980
Come, come. Surely you of all people
must understand.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.274
Sometimes such measures are necessary.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.693
Those people are innocent.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.321
As were so many that you put to death.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.620
If you must kill someone, kill me.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.163
You'll get your wish,

04:07.832 --> 04:08.999
but not yet.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.004
First, I want you to suffer
as I suffered.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.798
To know what it's like
to be alone and afraid,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.635
to be disgusted with who
and what you are.

04:26.851 --> 04:28.727
Do you really hate me so much?

04:34.358 --> 04:37.027
You cannot begin to know
how much I hate you.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.338
It's rat.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.301
Oh, believe me, you've eaten far worse.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.887
| mean, I've definitely served you
things I would never have touched,

05:02.970 --> 05:04.096
but you wolfed them down no problem.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.224
Merlin, for once,
leave me in peace, please.

05:12.563 --> 05:13.564
| understand.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.901
Your father lied to you about Morgana.
| don't know why.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.196
I'm sure he had his reasons,
but now is not the time for that.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.281
He's still your father. He needs you.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.116
Camelot needs you.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.914
I've known her all my life.
How could she do this to us?

05:29.997 --> 05:34.251
| can't answer that, but you have a duty
to your father, to your people.

05:34.335 --> 05:38.506
-You can't give up on them now.
-You cannot defeat an immortal army.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.258
We don't know until we try.

06:07.076 --> 06:09.954
I'm beginning to see the challenges
that I face.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.457
Being queen is not so simple, Gwen.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.335
You're doing well, Your Majesty.

06:16.418 --> 06:19.672
You think?
The knights do not share your view.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.259
They don't know you.

06:26.262 --> 06:27.638
| need their allegiance.

06:28.973 --> 06:30.849
Without that,
the people will not yield to me.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.437
My mother was a maid
in Sir Leon's household.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.816
We grew up together.
| could talk to him.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.942
Try to make him see sense?

06:41.610 --> 06:43.904
-You would do that for me?
-Uther killed my father.

06:45.364 --> 06:48.325
Yes, I forgot you too had suffered.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.202
Let me meet with Sir Leon.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.001
-I will arrange it.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.841
We need to act before Morgana
gets any stronger.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.884
Have you sent word to Lancelot yet?

07:05.968 --> 07:10.055
| sent a letter to Haldor days ago.
He's probably moved on.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.766
-Give it time.
-We don't have time. We need to act now.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.893
| know, Merlin, but how?

07:16.061 --> 07:18.606
There was an immortal army before,
how was it defeated?

07:18.689 --> 07:21.525
The Cup of Life had to be emptied
of the blood it contained.

07:22.192 --> 07:25.362
Once that had happened,
the enchantment no longer held.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.200
-Then that's what I have to do.
-They're immortal, Merlin.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.746
You don't know the power to defeat
a soldier, never mind an army.

07:40.878 --> 07:41.962
Guinevere.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.423
-It's all I could get.
-I don't understand.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.008
What are you doing here?

07:47.134 --> 07:52.181
Morgana sent me to talk to you,
to make you see sense. Listen to me.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.516
-I'd rather starve. Guard!
-I'm going to help you escape.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.645
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

07:59.146 --> 08:01.774
It's all right. Get me some water.

08:04.068 --> 08:06.945
The queen has instructed me
to get the prisoner food and water!

08:10.699 --> 08:12.368
You know what will happen to you
if you're caught?

08:12.451 --> 08:13.577
We have to find Arthur.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.121
I've a good idea where he'll be hiding.

08:17.039 --> 08:20.167
-Then I need to get you out of here.
-How? It's impossible, surely.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.128
I'm a trusted member of the court.

08:23.796 --> 08:25.506
(BOTH WHISPERING)

08:26.757 --> 08:30.678
It is as we suspected.
She's betrayed me.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.349
| will have her executed at dawn.

08:35.432 --> 08:39.311
No. Wait. This is good.

08:40.229 --> 08:44.733
Let her run to beloved prince.
She will lead us straight to him.

(WHISPERING)

08:50.322 --> 08:53.784
-Merlin, what are you doing?
-Looking for something.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.202
What?

08:58.122 --> 09:01.625
This. When I met the Fisher King,
he gave me this.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.302
He told me, in Camelot's darkest hour,
when all seems lost,

09:13.554 --> 09:15.514
it would show me the way.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.934
Yes. But how?

09:21.145 --> 09:23.647
That's what I've got to find out.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.114
-Did you speak to Sir Leon?
-Yes.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.576
And will he do as you asked?

09:35.993 --> 09:38.328
It might take some time,
but I think he will come round.

09:39.163 --> 09:43.333
Gwen, this deserves a celebration.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.420
Your Majesty...

09:49.423 --> 09:53.469
-To friendship and loyalty.
-To friendship and loyalty.

-Now is the moment.
-I don't understand.

12:19.531 --> 12:23.285
There is but one weapon that can slay
something which is already dead.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.332
A blade forged in the Dragon's breath.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.127
That weapon lies at the bottom of
the Lake of Avalon.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.962
Where you hid it.

12:34.046 --> 12:37.591

they're very much alive.

Morgause, they became the living dead.

-And you will give me the sword?

23:10.598 --> 23:12.141
They must've been left by bandits.

23:29.617 --> 23:32.161
Here! Come and join me.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.684
This table belonged
to the ancient Kings of Camelot.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.564
A round table afforded no one man
more importance than any other.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.736
They believed in equality in all things.

24:05.945 --> 24:10.533
So it seems fitting
that we revive this tradition now.

24:13.202 --> 24:17.498
Without each of you,
we would not be here.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.880
My father has languished in prison
for too long.

24:24.881 --> 24:28.217
Tomorrow, I make my bid to rescue him.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.556
Are there any around this table
who would join me?

24:43.900 --> 24:46.861
You taught me the values
of being a knight,

24:47.236 --> 24:50.406
the code by which a man
should live his life.

24:52.909 --> 24:57.997
To fight with honor for justice,
freedom,

24:59.666 --> 25:00.917
and all that's good.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.508
| believe in the world
that you will build.

25:13.805 --> 25:16.933
Even though I was a commoner, a nobody,

25:18.059 --> 25:20.269
you were willing
to lay down your life for me, Arthur.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.273
It is now my turn to repay you.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.032
| have fought alongside you many times,

25:34.617 --> 25:37.620
there is no one
that I would rather die for.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.082
| think we've no chance,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.878
but I wouldn't miss it for the world.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.763
Your enemies are my enemies.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.268
If you need an old man.

26:10.361 --> 26:11.654
You know the answer.

26:19.704 --> 26:20.955
Merlin?

26:22.749 --> 26:25.042
-No, don't really fancy it.
-You don't have a choice, Merlin.

26:25.126 --> 26:26.294
Okay.

26:37.138 --> 26:41.893
| want to thank you all for staying
loyal to me in Camelot's hour of need.

26:45.188 --> 26:48.024
I'll do something
that my father won't approve of.

27:03.080 --> 27:07.752
Arise, Sir Lancelot, Knight of Camelot.

27:11.297 --> 27:15.551
Arise, Sir Gwaine, Knight of Camelot.

27:16.969 --> 27:21.390
Arise, Sir Percival, Knight of Camelot.

27:23.726 --> 27:27.313
Arise, Sir Elyan, Knight of Camelot.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.903
Tomorrow, when you fight,
you can stand proud

27:35.655 --> 27:40.952
knowing you are members of the most
noble army the world has ever known.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.466
You're a knight.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.012
-At last.
-But for how long?

28:01.597 --> 28:02.974
Who knows.

28:10.314 --> 28:14.694
What are you planning?
And don't even think about lying.

28:14.777 --> 28:15.778
| know you too well.

28:23.286 --> 28:26.622
-It's too difficult to explain.
-You can tell me.

28:33.045 --> 28:37.008
Morgana has the Cup of Life.
If I can find it

28:37.550 --> 28:41.095
and empty it of the blood within,
then the army will be destroyed,

28:41.178 --> 28:43.180
and Morgana will be powerless.

28:44.974 --> 28:49.687
Aren't you forgetting something?
It's guarded by an immortal army.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.773
Aren't you forgetting something?
| have magic.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.277
Doesn't make you immortal.

28:58.279 --> 28:59.363
No.

29:01.032 --> 29:04.619
You know, Merlin,
you're the one Arthur should knight.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.875
You're the bravest of us all
and he doesn't even know.

29:13.961 --> 29:17.715
He can't. Not yet.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.720
That's why I need to find a way to get
to the Cup without Arthur knowing.

29:24.138 --> 29:25.640
Leave that to me.

29:35.316 --> 29:38.819
There is a tunnel under the northern
ramparts that brings us only a few paces

29:38.903 --> 29:42.740
from the entrance to the dungeons.
It will be well guarded.

29:42.865 --> 29:45.701
So if we're going to break everyone out,
we must remain unobserved.

29:46.077 --> 29:48.287
We cannot let them raise the alarm.

29:48.371 --> 29:49.914
We need to take out the warning bell.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.083
That way the warriors
have no means of communication.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.668
-Good idea.
-I'll need someone with me

29:53.751 --> 29:55.044
who knows the castle.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.046
I'll go.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.092
All right.

30:07.014 --> 30:11.560
Stay here with Gaius. I want you
to gather firewood and make bandages.

30:12.937 --> 30:14.271
There'll be casualties.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.984
-All right.
-Guinevere...

30:20.361 --> 30:21.779
They'll see.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.784
| don't care. I want you to know,

30:30.287 --> 30:33.833
-if I never see you again...
-You will. You will see me.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.254
| watched you last night.

30:38.921 --> 30:41.841
You gave us hope,
something to believe in.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.344
| saw the king you will become.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.765
I'm so proud of you, Arthur.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.505
You need to be careful.

31:22.214 --> 31:26.052
I've got the easy bit. The warning bell
is nothing compared to the cells.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.179
| overheard you, Merlin.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.932
If Morgause catches you,
she'll kill you.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.312
| have no choice.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.234
| remember the bungling idiot that came

31:42.318 --> 31:45.362
charging into my chamber
all those years ago.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.658
Who would believe?

32:26.695 --> 32:27.863
Gaius?

32:34.370 --> 32:35.579
Gaius!

32:37.873 --> 32:38.999
Good luck.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.942
| can sense the Cup's power.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.571
This way.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.504
What is that?

33:27.756 --> 33:30.342
It was forged in a Dragon's breath.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.102
(WHISTLES)

33:45.941 --> 33:47.026
Now!

33:51.113 --> 33:52.698
Stay there, and don't move.

34:02.499 --> 34:03.834
What do we do now?

34:21.768 --> 34:22.811
(GRUNTING)

35:07.564 --> 35:08.857
(BOTH PANTING)

35:27.293 --> 35:29.086
Father, we have to hurry.

35:36.218 --> 35:37.636
I'm sorry.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.725
Please, Father, now isn't the time.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.917
(GROANS)

36:14.381 --> 36:15.924
(BELL TOLLING)

36:16.967 --> 36:18.886
What the hell are those two doing?

36:51.043 --> 36:52.127
(GRUNTS)

37:09.311 --> 37:12.981
If we're going to go down,
we'll go down fighting!

37:13.315 --> 37:15.484
For the love of Camelot!

37:15.609 --> 37:17.152
(ALL YELLING)

37:23.992 --> 37:26.745
| have a feeling
| won't be seeing you again.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.498
No, you won't.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.291
(CASTING SPELL)

37:32.292 --> 37:33.335
(GROANS)

37:39.842 --> 37:41.176
(SCREAMS)

37:44.847 --> 37:46.640
Merlin! The Cup!

38:16.128 --> 38:18.464
No! No!

38:23.886 --> 38:24.887
Sister?

38:29.558 --> 38:31.268
(MORGANA CRYING)

38:35.314 --> 38:36.398
It's over, Morgana.

38:39.359 --> 38:43.071
No, you're wrong. This has just begun!

38:48.785 --> 38:49.870
No.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.080
(SOBBING)

38:52.164 --> 38:53.248
(SCREAMING) No!

39:09.431 --> 39:11.225
(MORGANA SCREAMING)

39:21.860 --> 39:23.946
You're safe now, Father.

39:29.618 --> 39:30.953
Where's Gwaine?

39:35.541 --> 39:36.625
Gwaine?

39:39.294 --> 39:40.462
You still alive?

39:42.548 --> 39:44.299
GWAINE: What do you think?

39:48.387 --> 39:50.639
And that's Sir Gwaine to you.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.693
Have you seen the state of these boots?

40:02.776 --> 40:03.902
Yeah.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.030
I'll go and get something to clean them.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.198
Why?

40:09.616 --> 40:10.951
They're your boots.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.579
Have you lost your mind?

40:14.538 --> 40:16.456
| thought you believed in equality.

40:16.999 --> 40:19.001
-I'm sorry?
-At the round table, you said...

40:19.084 --> 40:20.377
Shut up, Merlin.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.224
How's your father?

40:36.768 --> 40:37.853
| don't know.

40:40.522 --> 40:41.565
All this,

40:42.774 --> 40:43.859
Morgana,

40:45.736 --> 40:46.862
it's hit him hard.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.158
Perhaps we're heading for a new time.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.662
You may need to take charge, become...

40:58.790 --> 41:00.042
Become king.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.715
Who knows what the future will bring.

42:09.820 --> 42:14.366
And they searched through the remains
of the rubble, and still no Morgana.

42:14.908 --> 42:16.368
Or Morgause.

42:18.370 --> 42:20.205
Well, they won't have gone far.

42:24.626 --> 42:29.798
Merlin, no one else is going to say this
to you, but I will.

42:32.926 --> 42:34.428
Well done.

42:39.349 --> 42:41.226
| told you Camelot needed both of us.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.186
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

42:45.230 --> 42:47.524
We're going to have to tidy
this place up.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.401
Mmm.

42:53.530 --> 42:54.906
Well, not now.

42:55.741 --> 42:57.200
Where are you going?

42:59.202 --> 43:00.370
Uh...

43:03.415 --> 43:04.499
What are you up to?

43:06.626 --> 43:08.420
There's something I have to do.

43:14.509 --> 43:18.722
GREAT DRAGON: In the wrong hands,
this sword can do great evil.

43:19.681 --> 43:24.519
You must promise me, Merlin,
that once its task is done,

43:25.520 --> 43:28.899
you will place it
where none can wield it.
