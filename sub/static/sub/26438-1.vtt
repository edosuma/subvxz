04:28.134 --> 04:30.203
- Miss Crimson Rose.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.973
It is a pleasure to see you
again finally

04:34.774 --> 04:38.077
and a warm welcome to
Black Rock Manor.

04:45.751 --> 04:49.355
Sylus, take her things
to her room.

04:55.861 --> 04:58.864
- That's a rather nice
suitcase for someone like you.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.767
Is it borrowed?

05:01.767 --> 05:06.839
- Ah, please excuse me, this
is the mistress of the house,

05:07.373 --> 05:09.442
my charming wife Eliza.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.921
- How do you do Lady Whipley?

05:21.921 --> 05:23.789
- It's madam to you.

05:23.789 --> 05:24.924
- My apologies madam.

05:26.525 --> 05:29.795
- Eliza, this is the
fine young maid

05:29.795 --> 05:32.965
we have been so
eagerly awaiting,

05:32.965 --> 05:35.501
Miss Cordetta Crimson Rose.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.903
- Yes I could see she
was the maid Harkin.

05:38.804 --> 05:41.607
Besides, it's rather rare
to get visitors

05:41.607 --> 05:42.742
all the way out here.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.145
I trust your
journey was pleasant?

05:46.946 --> 05:50.016
Well let's not waste my
time standing around.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.283
I'll give her the tour.

05:52.251 --> 05:53.619
- I'd very much like that.

05:54.487 --> 05:58.157
- It's not for you to
like, it's a necessity.

05:58.157 --> 06:01.794
I have many house rules
I don't wish to repeat

06:01.794 --> 06:03.462
more than once.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.564
- I'll show her around Eliza.

06:05.564 --> 06:07.933
- You shall certainly
not Harkin.

06:07.933 --> 06:10.102
You have matters to attend.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.373
Come along Cordetta, darling.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.283
The house has 32 rooms,

06:25.284 --> 06:27.253
in time you will learn
your way around

06:27.253 --> 06:29.622
but you are not to go exploring.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.330
Cordetta.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.933
- What's on the top floor?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.436
- That's the door to the attic.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.639
The door's to remain
locked at all times

06:46.639 --> 06:48.941
and is out of bounds to
you and the children.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.511
Come along, I'll show you to
your room.

07:12.732 --> 07:16.836
- My goodness, this room is
bigger than my father's house.

07:16.836 --> 07:17.837
- I don't doubt it.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.639
But it's not me you
have to thank.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.376
My husband looks far too
kindly upon the servants

07:24.376 --> 07:29.348
in this house, that wretched
grounds keeper Sylus included.

07:29.348 --> 07:32.518
- I hadn't expected
this kindness from him.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.920
- Harkin is stubborn
in his demands

07:34.920 --> 07:35.955
but believe me,

07:40.392 --> 07:42.461
he does not know kindness.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.199
Listen to me closely Cordetta

07:47.199 --> 07:50.469
my husband is a sick man
with an unhinged mind

07:50.469 --> 07:52.571
and whilst he may seem
all the more welcoming

07:52.571 --> 07:56.475
compared to me, my duty
is to run this house

07:56.475 --> 07:58.577
and to raise our children,

07:58.577 --> 08:01.080
tasks for which he
offers little help.

08:03.482 --> 08:08.120
His charm is but a trail of
bread crumbs

08:08.120 --> 08:10.055
which you'll be wise
not to follow.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.294
Mind your business
while you're here.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.903
You may enter Sylus.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.772
You can start by
unpacking her things.

08:26.772 --> 08:29.074
Put what clothes she
has in the wardrobe.

08:29.074 --> 08:30.776
- Oh no, no please.

08:30.776 --> 08:34.013
That's most kind but I'd
rather unpack myself.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.650
- Nonsense girl, you
haven't got time to waste.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.951
We've got a lot of
ground to cover

08:38.951 --> 08:40.953
and I want you
started right away.

08:41.886 --> 08:46.826
- Please be careful,
that's very precious to me.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.360
- What's that?

08:48.360 --> 08:49.528
- My pocket watch.

08:49.528 --> 08:52.164
- A broken pocket watch,

08:52.164 --> 08:55.367
one more fit to belong
to a rich man

08:55.367 --> 08:57.236
rather than our young maid.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.806
- Well what use is a broken
pocket watch?

09:01.974 --> 09:03.609
- It belonged to my brother.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.979
It's very special to me and
it's everything I have of him.

09:08.948 --> 09:12.585
- Well as long as you have a
functional time keeping device

09:12.585 --> 09:14.153
to accompany it.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.689
I run a strict schedule
in this house

09:16.689 --> 09:18.858
and I will not
tolerate lateness.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.131
Be careful with the rest
of her clutter will you.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.711
Children your father wishes me

09:38.711 --> 09:41.247
to introduce you
to our new maid.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.949
Her name is Cordetta
but you may call her

09:43.949 --> 09:45.885
an english name if you prefer.

09:46.919 --> 09:51.423
This is Agatha, Evelyn my
youngest and my son Adriel.

09:52.691 --> 09:54.093
- Pleasure to meet you children.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.761
- But Mother she's black.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.630
- She's your father's
choice Agatha

09:58.430 --> 10:00.532
and we must
respect his decision.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.003
He has asked you to make her
feel welcome.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.604
- Welcome?

10:05.604 --> 10:06.772
But doesn't she know what
happened here?

10:06.772 --> 10:10.643
- She soon will Hergdo still
walks the halls at night.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.645
- That's quite enough
of your nonsense.

10:12.645 --> 10:13.879
- Sorry Mother.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.815
- Cordetta will serve
supper at seven o'clock.

10:16.815 --> 10:19.451
I want you to be at the
table and waiting for prayer.

10:19.451 --> 10:20.352
- Yes Mother.

10:20.352 --> 10:21.820
- Now back to your studying.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.792
Evelyn, I would like you
to show Cordetta

10:26.792 --> 10:30.829
back to her room, she
has things to unpack.

10:41.106 --> 10:42.675
- This is yours.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.177
- Thank you Evelyn.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.446
- It's not true you know,
about the ghost?

10:48.681 --> 10:50.182
They like to tease.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.885
- I don't believe in
ghosts Evelyn but if I did

10:53.919 --> 10:56.355
they wouldn't scare me
half as much as the living.

11:03.228 --> 11:04.596
- I recognize that watch.

11:05.664 --> 11:08.067
- Well I imagine it's a
common make.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.668
But to me it can't be replaced.

11:10.436 --> 11:13.038
I apologize if I seemed
rude before.

11:13.038 --> 11:14.373
- It's not a common make.

11:15.374 --> 11:19.578
I knew a man,
a very wealthy nobleman,

11:19.578 --> 11:22.147
who owned one
peculiarly similar.

11:23.615 --> 11:27.086
May I ask where your brother
acquired it?

11:27.086 --> 11:28.787
- No you may not.

11:28.787 --> 11:30.556
Do not touch my things.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.834
- You know the last
maid died in that room.

11:43.469 --> 11:46.372
- It's an old house, I'm sure
lots of people died here.

11:47.806 --> 11:49.308
- But how many were murdered?

11:50.509 --> 11:51.410
- Murdered?

11:52.711 --> 11:54.847
- It took a lot of hard
work to clean the blood

11:54.847 --> 11:56.849
from those floorboards,

11:56.849 --> 12:00.285
even the room below, when
the gore trickled through

12:01.186 --> 12:03.088
drenched poor Adriel
in his sleep.

12:14.666 --> 12:19.471
You'd do well to steer
clear of Lady Whipley

12:19.471 --> 12:21.807
when she gets into a fit of
jealous rage,

12:22.741 --> 12:26.779
armed with a straight
razor, she can be deadly.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.982
- Get out.

12:29.982 --> 12:30.883
- Of course.

12:32.684 --> 12:33.786
The room's all yours.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.761
Not long after my arrival

12:42.761 --> 12:45.064
we were joined by a new
member of the house.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.333
Damien DeHaan was to be
engaged to Agatha

12:49.134 --> 12:51.036
at the stern request
of Lady Whipley

12:51.904 --> 12:54.640
and I soon became a part
of this strange family

12:54.640 --> 12:56.275
and a part of Black Rock Manor.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.878
On the first day of every month

12:59.878 --> 13:02.081
she would leave the house
to visit her twin sister

13:02.081 --> 13:04.416
who lived in the
village far below

13:04.416 --> 13:06.618
and she'd return with supplies,

13:06.618 --> 13:08.287
everything the family
might need.

13:14.393 --> 13:17.062
It was merely days before
my treasured pocket watch

13:17.062 --> 13:18.497
went missing whilst I slept

13:19.398 --> 13:22.468
and I suspected Sylus had
entered my room at night

13:22.468 --> 13:23.635
and stolen it from me.

13:25.037 --> 13:29.675
They mustn't uncover the true
reasons as to why I am here.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.256
- Mother, it's Evelyn!

14:17.256 --> 14:18.557
She's locked the door!

14:25.364 --> 14:27.599
- It is Evelyn,
the door won't open!

14:27.599 --> 14:28.767
There's somebody in
there with her!

14:28.767 --> 14:30.169
- Out of my way!

14:33.005 --> 14:35.474
Evelyn open the door!

14:35.474 --> 14:36.308
Evelyn!

14:54.693 --> 14:55.627
Stop it!

14:55.627 --> 15:00.132
- Evelyn you must tell me where
all this bloods come from!

15:00.132 --> 15:01.833
- There was a man and he was in
my room!

15:01.833 --> 15:02.668
- Who?

15:02.668 --> 15:03.902
Oh Evelyn what man?

15:03.902 --> 15:04.736
Who?

15:04.736 --> 15:05.637
- I don't know!

15:07.606 --> 15:09.308
- Where's Sylus?

15:09.308 --> 15:10.142
Where's your father?

15:10.142 --> 15:13.045
- Get your sister out of
that bloody nightdress

15:13.045 --> 15:16.215
and take her into the bathroom!

15:16.215 --> 15:17.583
Lock your doors!

15:18.517 --> 15:20.419
- Sh, sh, sh.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.223
- Harkin! Harkin!

15:25.424 --> 15:26.692
Where is Master Whipley?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.629
- I haven't seen
him since supper.

15:30.629 --> 15:33.432
- Agatha.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.399
- Who was he?

15:34.399 --> 15:35.934
What did he say?

15:35.934 --> 15:39.104
- I can't, I
can't remember.

16:03.161 --> 16:04.396
- Blood.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.665
- Sylus what the
devil is going on?

16:07.733 --> 16:11.603
- A most mysterious
occurrence ma'am.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.042
I haven't a clue

16:26.285 --> 16:27.786
- Get up!

16:27.786 --> 16:30.789
My husband is gone you're going
out to search the hillside.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.125
Hurry girl!

16:37.562 --> 16:41.333
You are to head out into the
hills and find my husband.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.736
Do not return without
him is that understood?

16:44.736 --> 16:48.840
- Finding Master Whipley
on this dark winter's night

16:48.840 --> 16:51.643
seems an impossible task ma'am.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.846
We'd fare better to begin
this search at daybreak.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.381
- We'll freeze out there.

16:56.381 --> 16:59.851
- You will not be welcomed
back into this house

16:59.851 --> 17:00.852
empty handed.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.898
Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.874
Evelyn, you must tell me
what happened.

17:22.874 --> 17:26.611
- I don't remember.

17:26.611 --> 17:27.746
I can't see his face.

17:28.747 --> 17:29.648
- Who Evelyn?

17:30.816 --> 17:32.150
Who bound you to the bed?

17:33.652 --> 17:35.821
You must remember who's blood
covered you.

17:40.525 --> 17:41.860
- I said I don't.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.162
- Then what was it that
made you scream?

17:47.299 --> 17:49.000
- I had a most
frightening dream.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.203
- A dream?

17:51.203 --> 17:52.337
- That is all I know.

17:54.639 --> 17:56.341
- You can tell me.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.110
You know you can tell
your mother anything.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.811
- I just want to sleep.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.848
I want to forget.

18:07.018 --> 18:10.088
- You mustn't forget, tell me.

18:13.792 --> 18:14.693
- I was small.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.132
It was as if I were dreaming
through the eyes of a child

18:22.067 --> 18:26.138
wandering the halls
of this house.

18:26.138 --> 18:28.874
Except it wasn't this
house, it was different.

19:22.994 --> 19:27.332
- Evelyn, Evelyn you've
gone silent.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.333
- I'm sorry Mother.

19:29.734 --> 19:30.702
I'm just so tired.

19:30.702 --> 19:36.274
- Fine, you'll stay in
your sister's room tonight.

19:36.274 --> 19:38.810
You're not to be left alone.

20:09.774 --> 20:11.576
- Lady Whipley, we've
searched through the night

20:11.576 --> 20:13.678
and found no trace
of your husband.

20:13.678 --> 20:15.480
It's as if he's
completely vanished.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.749
- A person cannot simply vanish.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.951
- Please we are tired
and need rest.

20:19.951 --> 20:22.921
- And this house
needs it's master.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.623
- Perhaps he's fled ma'am.

20:25.690 --> 20:28.727
Perhaps he doesn't
wish to return.

20:28.727 --> 20:33.665
- Then perhaps he can take
his useless servants with him!

20:44.342 --> 20:46.378
- What do you think
has happened to Father?

20:46.378 --> 20:48.079
- Perhaps he saw something
that scared him so much

20:48.079 --> 20:49.581
he had to run away.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.882
- Or he saw a ghost.

20:50.882 --> 20:51.716
- What are you?

20:51.716 --> 20:53.919
- I know you've heard
it too Agatha.

20:54.686 --> 20:55.754
The girl crying in the night.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.758
- Footsteps awake me from my
sleep when nobody's there.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.092
- What footsteps?

21:01.092 --> 21:02.494
- In the room next to mine.

21:02.494 --> 21:03.395
- That room is locked Adriel.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.196
- Well I'm telling you
what I know.

21:06.231 --> 21:07.132
It's a ghost.

21:08.333 --> 21:12.804
It's the maid, she's come back
for us all.

21:13.905 --> 21:16.908
- You don't really think it
was Sylus who killed her.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.109
- Why don't you ask him?

21:18.109 --> 21:20.445
- But this isn't the
first time that one of us

21:20.445 --> 21:21.913
have woken covered in blood.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.183
It's a little strange
don't you think?

21:41.299 --> 21:42.934
- Evelyn wait.

22:32.817 --> 22:33.985
- Who let you in there?

22:33.985 --> 22:34.853
- The door was open.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.655
- This door is always locked.

22:36.655 --> 22:37.889
- I swear it was open.

22:37.889 --> 22:41.526
- You know it's forbidden
for you to enter the attic.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.228
- I just thought maybe
it was Father.

22:43.228 --> 22:44.029
- Well it isn't.

22:44.029 --> 22:48.900
- There's nothing up there but
spiders and cobwebs Agatha.

22:48.900 --> 22:53.505
Just a dusty old attic that
is unsafe for you to enter.

22:53.505 --> 22:56.374
I simply don't want you
getting hurt.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.593
Who is it?

23:48.593 --> 23:49.994
Has he returned?

23:49.994 --> 23:51.963
- It's not your
husband ma'am.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.834
- He hasn't said
a word, just keeps knocking.

23:57.001 --> 24:00.572
- Well open the door,
he'll wake the whole house.

24:01.873 --> 24:03.475
Let's see what he wants.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.787
- Pardon my intrusion
at this late hour

24:15.787 --> 24:18.656
but I find myself stranded
by this deathly storm

24:18.656 --> 24:20.091
which has claimed my horse.

24:21.426 --> 24:23.495
I seek shelter before it
claims me too.

24:24.329 --> 24:25.530
- Who are you?

24:25.530 --> 24:27.265
How did you find this house?

24:27.265 --> 24:29.601
- I will explain everything
if you'll just save me

24:29.601 --> 24:31.035
from this hellish downpour.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.204
Please.

24:41.613 --> 24:44.415
Wait, if your servants
would bring in

24:44.415 --> 24:45.617
my trunk from the rain?

24:46.451 --> 24:48.787
It's heavy but the
contents are most fragile.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.222
- Bring it inside.

25:08.439 --> 25:09.440
- I'm very grateful for your
kind hospitality Miss...

25:11.276 --> 25:13.945
- You may stay here
for tonight only.

25:13.945 --> 25:16.548
When the storm has
passed you must leave.

25:16.548 --> 25:17.949
- Of course.

25:17.949 --> 25:20.118
- Frankly you're
misfortune is not a problem

25:20.118 --> 25:22.353
my family or I wish to be
burdened with.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.456
Believe me, we have
enough of our own.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.160
Leave that dirty old thing in
the lobby.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.130
I don't want it dripping
all over the house.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.165
- I think the stairs
would kill us.

25:34.165 --> 25:37.135
- Don't make me change
my mind Sylus.

25:37.135 --> 25:38.703
- I'm sure we can provide
all he needs

25:38.703 --> 25:40.171
for a comfortable night.

25:41.739 --> 25:43.708
- Take a seat at the table.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.511
Cordetta will provide you
something warm to drink.

25:46.511 --> 25:47.412
- Most kind.

25:50.281 --> 25:51.182
- Your coat sir.

26:03.428 --> 26:05.263
Wonderful to see you again sir.

26:06.364 --> 26:09.067
It's been a long, long time.

26:48.706 --> 26:52.377
- I apologize for my
alarming appearance.

26:52.377 --> 26:55.113
My white mare Abraxis
was sadly decapitated

26:55.113 --> 26:56.481
by a bolt of lightening.

26:57.749 --> 26:59.183
- Decapitated?

26:59.183 --> 27:02.487
- She rode on headless for
about another 100 yards

27:02.487 --> 27:06.557
blood spewing from the
severed stump of her neck

27:06.557 --> 27:08.059
before collapsing in
a muddy ditch

27:08.059 --> 27:11.629
and leaving me for the storm.

27:11.629 --> 27:16.701
I can still taste her warm,
salty blood in my throat.

27:18.202 --> 27:20.805
I had hoped the rain
would've washed it clean

27:20.805 --> 27:22.540
by the time I arrived
at Black Rock.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.179
You don't have anything
stronger by chance?

27:28.179 --> 27:30.782
- Drinking is forbidden
in this house.

27:30.782 --> 27:31.683
- My mistake.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.755
This is Black Rock Manor
is it not?

27:38.957 --> 27:40.224
- Where were you headed?

27:46.197 --> 27:50.201
- A long time ago as your,
elderly servant may recall,

27:50.201 --> 27:54.205
there was a very exclusive
perlue high up in this valley.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.675
It's location was
somewhat secret

27:59.410 --> 28:01.312
and only a select
few would visit

28:01.312 --> 28:03.748
and by invitation only,
of course.

28:03.748 --> 28:06.484
I'd heard stories in the
valley below where to find it

28:06.484 --> 28:08.619
but Abraxis and I...

28:12.323 --> 28:13.524
Well you know the rest.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.795
I must have traveled
three miles on foot

28:17.795 --> 28:19.731
in that treacherous rain.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.199
- You may stay in my
son Adriel's room tonight.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.103
He can share with Damien.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.170
- Indeed.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.946
- What are you doing?

28:34.946 --> 28:38.216
- I need something from my
room, it's too cold in here.

28:40.685 --> 28:43.154
- Don't let your mother
catch you on your own.

28:43.154 --> 28:44.555
- I'll be quick.

29:11.215 --> 29:13.951
Sorry sir, I, I didn't
realize you were in here.

29:13.951 --> 29:17.121
- No trouble, the warm
glow of the fire is very

29:17.121 --> 29:18.589
enticing on this cold night.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.492
You must be Adriel.

29:21.492 --> 29:22.727
- I'll leave you in private.

29:22.727 --> 29:23.561
I'm sorry.

29:23.561 --> 29:24.595
- Don't be sorry Adriel.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.165
I am the intruder here not you.

29:29.667 --> 29:33.104
The manor's not much warmer
than the biting wind outside.

29:34.238 --> 29:36.974
You must be chilly in
those bed clothes.

29:38.810 --> 29:39.710
Come.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.214
Warm yourself with me,
it's hot by the fire.

30:00.231 --> 30:01.332
I don't mean to frighten you.

30:01.332 --> 30:02.433
- I'm not frightened.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.370
- But you can't take
your eyes off the blood.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.111
- What happened?

30:14.112 --> 30:16.147
- I had a run in with a
pair of thieves

30:16.147 --> 30:17.782
as I journeyed up the hillside.

30:19.250 --> 30:23.187
They saw me approaching and
waited to attack, two of them.

30:24.789 --> 30:29.060
One had a long, thin knife
and the other had a crossbow.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.530
Neither knew that I
had spotted them.

30:34.098 --> 30:35.800
- What did you do?

30:35.800 --> 30:38.002
- Well I took a big hard rock

30:39.470 --> 30:43.141
and when they leapt out I
cracked it against one's skull

30:44.842 --> 30:46.577
and thrust it again into
the other one's shin

30:46.577 --> 30:48.079
until I heard the bone break.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.151
When he collapsed and I knew
he wouldn't follow after me.

30:54.552 --> 30:57.622
The first man I fear he was
already dead.

31:01.659 --> 31:04.295
It was his blood that exploded
from his soft, pink brain

31:04.295 --> 31:06.030
and covered me.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.369
- He's locked in
my trunk downstairs.

31:12.937 --> 31:14.805
- You, you can't leave
him in there.

31:16.007 --> 31:16.941
What if he escapes?

31:16.941 --> 31:18.276
- It's locked.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.777
- Well what if he suffocates?

31:20.878 --> 31:21.979
What if you kill him?

31:21.979 --> 31:23.915
- What if he had robbed
the clothes from my back

31:23.915 --> 31:25.650
and left me to freeze
in the storm?

31:25.650 --> 31:27.051
- Well you might have
died anyway

31:27.051 --> 31:28.686
if you hadn't found this manor.

31:29.720 --> 31:30.621
- Indeed.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.424
I'm quite in your debt
young sir.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.932
Here, would you help me?

31:41.966 --> 31:43.734
I can't reach over.

31:54.912 --> 31:56.214
- You better hope Mother
doesn't find out

31:56.214 --> 31:57.815
what you've got in that trunk.

32:06.324 --> 32:07.858
- And we both better
hope she doesn't find you

32:07.858 --> 32:10.795
in here with me, correct?

32:13.231 --> 32:14.699
- Damien will begin to worry.

32:21.038 --> 32:23.841
In case I don't see you in
the morning when I leave.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.009
- Goodbye.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.146
- Why did no one wake me?

35:15.146 --> 35:17.181
- I knocked ma'am but
you were fast asleep.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.449
- You look tired Mother.

35:19.683 --> 35:21.852
- The storm has passed
has it not?

35:24.355 --> 35:27.057
Then I assume
you're ready to leave.

35:27.057 --> 35:27.892
- Oh can't he stay for dinner?

35:27.892 --> 35:28.859
- No he cannot.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.530
- I sent for a carriage
to pick him up

35:32.530 --> 35:35.533
so that he may return
safely to the village.

35:35.533 --> 35:37.168
- Then where is it?

35:37.168 --> 35:41.138
- Unfortunately ma'am I've been
told the road is obstructed

35:41.138 --> 35:44.208
by a fallen tree but
they will have it clear

35:44.208 --> 35:45.342
in a day or two.

35:45.342 --> 35:47.378
- Surely you cannot expect
him to journey on foot

35:47.378 --> 35:48.546
with that heavy trunk?

35:50.014 --> 35:51.382
- Out!

35:51.382 --> 35:52.650
Pack your things now.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.386
I wish to speak to
my family alone.

36:13.404 --> 36:15.573
Does anyone recognize this?

36:16.874 --> 36:18.375
It doesn't belong to me

36:19.376 --> 36:22.413
and it certainly hasn't
been hidden by my children.

36:23.614 --> 36:24.515
Cordetta.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.795
Save the performance
the pair of you.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.798
Who's knife is this?

36:44.602 --> 36:45.536
Speak up!

36:45.536 --> 36:47.705
- It does belong to me ma'am.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.106
- Correct!

36:49.106 --> 36:52.009
And the blood I suspect belongs
to Harkin.

36:52.009 --> 36:55.279
What in God's name am I supposed
to think?

36:56.447 --> 36:58.883
- That knife has been
missing for months ma'am.

36:59.783 --> 37:02.853
In a house this size
things go missing.

37:02.853 --> 37:04.855
- And people too so it seems.

37:06.056 --> 37:08.092
One of you has used this knife.

37:08.993 --> 37:11.362
One of you has hidden it.

37:11.362 --> 37:14.665
And one of you knows exactly
what has happened to my husband

37:14.665 --> 37:17.801
and you will tell me at once.

37:17.801 --> 37:19.904
- Madam, neither one of us
has a clue.

37:20.771 --> 37:22.306
Do you think we would be
out all night searching

37:22.306 --> 37:23.707
if we knew where he was?

37:23.707 --> 37:27.478
- Do not try to pull the
wool over my eyes Cordetta.

37:27.478 --> 37:31.482
- I am not, I'm only trying
to help solve this mystery.

37:31.482 --> 37:34.018
- Then perhaps you
can solve this,

37:34.018 --> 37:35.986
blood on your nightdress.

37:39.023 --> 37:40.457
- This blood is my own.

37:40.457 --> 37:42.192
- Speak up girl!

37:56.840 --> 37:59.243
Cover that disgusting thing up.

38:02.913 --> 38:05.382
Children, to your rooms now.

38:13.257 --> 38:16.727
If I do not get an answer
soon I will be forced

38:16.727 --> 38:20.197
to use extreme methods
to uncover the truth.

38:30.274 --> 38:31.575
- Whatever Mother's
hiding in the attic

38:31.575 --> 38:33.911
is driving her completely mad.

38:33.911 --> 38:36.280
I swear to you Evelyn
I saw something,

38:36.280 --> 38:39.249
a person, a creature,
hiding amongst the cobwebs

38:39.249 --> 38:40.951
and the dust beneath
the rafters.

38:42.419 --> 38:44.955
We have to find a way up there,
tonight.

38:44.955 --> 38:47.124
- You would go up there in
the middle of the night?

38:47.124 --> 38:48.425
- Not alone.

38:48.425 --> 38:49.827
- Don't look at me Agatha.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.830
I most certainly won't be
venturing up there with you.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.965
- But what's up there Evelyn?

38:54.965 --> 38:56.333
What's behind that door
that's so terrible

38:56.333 --> 38:58.168
that Mother doesn't
want us to see?

38:58.168 --> 39:00.004
- I don't want to find out.

39:00.004 --> 39:03.907
- But we must, whatever it is,
whatever happened to Father,

39:03.907 --> 39:07.478
why that stranger's here.

39:07.478 --> 39:10.080
I have a bad feeling it's
all coming from up there.

40:10.274 --> 40:12.676
- Oh God, oh God, I am so sorry.

40:12.676 --> 40:14.645
I didn't know you were here.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.480
- Yes you did, I stayed here
last night.

40:19.349 --> 40:21.652
- I mean I thought you
were elsewhere.

40:21.652 --> 40:22.486
I'll go.

40:22.486 --> 40:23.387
- I don't mind.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.427
- I can see I've disturbed
you at a inappropriate moment.

40:30.427 --> 40:31.595
- I said I don't mind.

40:37.968 --> 40:40.604
You'd have left by now if you
didn't want to stay right?

40:41.872 --> 40:44.441
Does he mind you creeping
into other men's rooms?

40:44.441 --> 40:45.542
- I was not creeping.

40:45.542 --> 40:47.077
- Would he mind if you were?

40:47.077 --> 40:48.645
- Who? Damien?

40:48.645 --> 40:50.380
- The pair of you
seem quite taken.

40:50.380 --> 40:52.783
- Well of course we're
engaged to be married.

40:52.783 --> 40:53.684
- Married?

40:55.285 --> 40:59.757
- I like the idea very much
if that's what you're asking.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.959
- Of course, we're
getting married aren't we?

41:01.959 --> 41:03.327
- That's not what I asked.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.997
When you go near him
and touch him

41:08.165 --> 41:09.600
do your bones shiver?

41:10.667 --> 41:13.170
Does hot blood shoot
though your body?

41:14.538 --> 41:17.374
Do you feel his eyes on
you even when they're not?

41:18.976 --> 41:20.778
Does you mouth turn dry?

41:20.778 --> 41:21.945
- Of course not.

41:21.945 --> 41:23.180
Not unless love
shares it's symptoms

41:23.180 --> 41:24.715
with a very unpleasant fever.

41:25.549 --> 41:27.117
- Some might say that it does.

41:29.386 --> 41:34.024
- Well then, love sounds
no fun at all.

41:35.859 --> 41:37.094
- He's a handsome gent.

41:37.928 --> 41:39.696
Surely it doesn't make
you this uncomfortable

41:39.696 --> 41:40.998
to gaze upon a man's body?

41:40.998 --> 41:42.132
- I wasn't gazing upon...

41:42.132 --> 41:45.602
- When you've had as
many as I sweet Agatha,

41:47.037 --> 41:48.939
you learn how to read
a woman's eyes.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.909
You know a gaze from a glance

41:53.210 --> 41:54.812
and a stare from a look

41:57.447 --> 41:58.816
and a lust from a longing.

42:01.752 --> 42:05.088
- It must be all the
dust in here.

42:05.088 --> 42:06.590
- Did he say anything about me?

42:06.590 --> 42:07.491
- Why should he?

42:08.292 --> 42:09.860
You're nobody.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.529
You've arrived from nowhere
and you've nowhere to go.

42:13.797 --> 42:14.765
What was there to say about you?

42:14.765 --> 42:16.099
- He didn't recognize me?

42:16.967 --> 42:18.035
- Should he?

42:18.035 --> 42:18.869
- I recognize him.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.103
- Oh really?

42:21.605 --> 42:23.674
- From the village at
the bottom of the valley.

42:24.775 --> 42:28.545
How much do you truly
know about him I wonder,

42:28.545 --> 42:30.514
before he came here?

42:30.514 --> 42:32.082
- Everything Mother has told me.

42:32.082 --> 42:34.985
- Mother, I've seen
her in the village too.

42:34.985 --> 42:37.087
- She has a sister there,
a twin.

42:37.988 --> 42:39.323
- Of course she does.

42:39.323 --> 42:41.959
- How dare you, how dare
you come into this house

42:41.959 --> 42:44.962
with your cryptic words and
saying such vulgar things.

42:44.962 --> 42:46.530
- You came into my room Agatha.

42:52.469 --> 42:53.704
- Who are you?

42:55.939 --> 42:57.674
You're no stranger
to this house.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.744
- No.

43:04.715 --> 43:08.752
You're all glorious butterflies
living caterpillar lives.

43:11.889 --> 43:14.658
Perhaps I'm the metamorphosis
you've been waiting for.

43:32.242 --> 43:34.478
- Shh, she'll hear us.

43:34.478 --> 43:36.780
- I can't do this any quieter.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.147
After you.

44:10.147 --> 44:11.548
- You've got to be
bloody joking.

44:11.548 --> 44:13.850
- Fine just stay
close behind me.

44:13.850 --> 44:16.320
- Don't worry I will.

44:33.403 --> 44:35.272
Can't we come back and
do this in the morning?

44:35.272 --> 44:37.040
- What, when Mother's
watching over us like a hawk?

45:33.030 --> 45:35.665
Christ Evelyn you'll wake the
whole house.

45:50.247 --> 45:52.315
- What have you found?

45:52.315 --> 45:54.885
- I don't know.

45:58.388 --> 46:00.590
What was that?

46:00.590 --> 46:01.825
Play it again.

46:13.336 --> 46:14.237
Stop.

46:15.038 --> 46:17.474
- Mercury.

46:17.474 --> 46:22.179
- That was on the back
of one of the photos.

46:22.179 --> 46:25.715
Look.

46:25.715 --> 46:28.085
- Eliza and Mercury, Black Rock.

46:30.353 --> 46:32.589
- Well that's been taken
about 20 or 30 years ago.

46:35.625 --> 46:36.460
- Agatha!

46:36.460 --> 46:37.828
I saw it, it went in there!

46:40.363 --> 46:41.398
Agatha don't go near it.

46:41.398 --> 46:42.966
- Be quiet Evelyn.

46:44.067 --> 46:45.268
It could be Father.

46:45.268 --> 46:46.436
- It wasn't Father,

46:46.436 --> 46:48.939
it was some sort of
creature like you said.

46:48.939 --> 46:50.373
Agatha.

47:07.757 --> 47:08.825
- Father?

47:22.739 --> 47:23.573
Evelyn!

47:35.685 --> 47:37.053
- Help let us out!

49:13.049 --> 49:14.484
- Damien.

49:14.484 --> 49:15.652
Damien!

49:31.401 --> 49:33.503
- Look Adriel,
look at the pictures.

49:34.704 --> 49:37.207
That's Mother pregnant and
look there she is again.

49:38.875 --> 49:39.776
- Yes.

49:40.977 --> 49:42.045
- Look at the dates.

49:42.946 --> 49:44.281
- So?

49:44.281 --> 49:46.182
- So, they were both
taken in the same month

49:46.182 --> 49:48.451
according to the hand writing.

49:48.451 --> 49:50.186
One moment she's pregnant

49:50.186 --> 49:52.222
and the next she's wearing
these weird clothes

49:52.222 --> 49:53.990
with no sign of
expecting a child.

49:55.025 --> 49:56.960
- So what are you trying to say?

49:56.960 --> 49:58.461
Somebody could have
mixed up the dates.

49:58.461 --> 50:00.997
- I think it must be her sister,
a twin.

50:01.798 --> 50:03.266
It's possible that
she stayed here

50:03.266 --> 50:04.801
while she was expecting us.

50:04.801 --> 50:06.036
- She never mentioned that.

50:06.036 --> 50:08.238
- But when has she ever
mentioned her past?

50:09.639 --> 50:11.041
- Don't forget the little girl.

50:11.041 --> 50:14.144
- Right, there's a photo of
Mother here

50:14.144 --> 50:18.181
with a girl, a young girl
named Mercury.

50:18.181 --> 50:19.683
- Well what a strange name.

50:19.683 --> 50:20.617
- Children.

50:20.617 --> 50:23.053
- Jesus Cordetta don't you
ever knock?

50:23.053 --> 50:24.754
- Where did you find
these photographs?

50:24.754 --> 50:25.588
- They're private.

50:25.588 --> 50:26.856
- In the attic.

50:26.856 --> 50:27.691
- Evelyn.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.694
She's not going to tell Mother
are you?

50:30.694 --> 50:31.995
- Not if they're private.

50:33.096 --> 50:34.698
I'm very sorry I disturbed you.

51:15.905 --> 51:16.806
- Sylus.

51:18.508 --> 51:21.411
Last night Evelyn and I
found some photographs

51:21.411 --> 51:23.146
and tape recordings
from years ago.

51:23.146 --> 51:26.082
- Your mother keeps the attic
locked for a reason child.

51:27.250 --> 51:28.451
What more did you find?

51:29.986 --> 51:30.887
- That was it.

51:32.355 --> 51:34.190
But I wanted to ask
you about it.

51:34.190 --> 51:36.493
Well you were around when
these were taken were you not?

51:36.493 --> 51:39.129
- That was a long time
ago Miss Whipley

51:39.129 --> 51:41.398
the manor's nothing
how it once was.

51:41.398 --> 51:42.665
- No you're wrong Sylus.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.836
Something, some sinister
thing from the past

51:46.836 --> 51:48.371
still walks the halls.

51:48.371 --> 51:50.540
- Father is missing
because of it.

51:50.540 --> 51:52.842
And that stranger is
here because of it too.

51:52.842 --> 51:55.779
- There's somethings you're
better off not knowing.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.081
The past is much better buried.

51:58.081 --> 51:59.749
- Well then answer me one thing.

52:00.950 --> 52:01.885
Who's Mercury?

52:05.388 --> 52:07.056
- Where did you hear that name?

52:07.056 --> 52:08.491
- It's here on this picture.

52:09.926 --> 52:11.961
And look, that's Mother
there too.

52:13.430 --> 52:15.131
Lady Whipley and Mercury.

52:15.899 --> 52:18.168
- We didn't see it at
first and then we noticed,

52:18.168 --> 52:20.270
a little girl hiding
in the back.

52:20.270 --> 52:21.171
- Who is she?

52:22.405 --> 52:24.641
- There was a child
in this house.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.143
You are not the only
Whipley children.

52:28.978 --> 52:29.946
The child is dead.

52:33.383 --> 52:36.519
I'm sorry, I've said
far too much.

52:37.420 --> 52:39.989
Leave these things alone, girls.

52:41.124 --> 52:42.725
Don't go looking any further.

52:49.332 --> 52:50.700
- That carriage that
you said that you called

52:50.700 --> 52:54.404
the other night, when
exactly will it arrive?

52:54.404 --> 52:57.307
- The one that you called
to take our peculiar visitor

52:57.307 --> 52:58.842
far away from this house.

52:58.842 --> 53:01.244
- Oh, that carriage.

53:02.946 --> 53:07.917
When the road is clear,
I'm sure one will come.

53:16.025 --> 53:18.094
- You asked to see me Eliza?

53:18.094 --> 53:19.729
- Close the door behind you.

53:27.670 --> 53:29.439
- That's Agatha's
private journal.

53:30.240 --> 53:32.275
What are you doing
reading those pages?

53:33.109 --> 53:34.010
- Sit.

53:36.446 --> 53:41.484
Forgive me Damien but I found
it left open upon her bed.

53:41.651 --> 53:45.321
I could not help buy
spy the detestable words

53:45.321 --> 53:46.489
written upon the page.

53:47.957 --> 53:49.592
I was glad to take it from her.

53:51.761 --> 53:52.762
- Detestable words?

53:53.696 --> 53:55.932
She doesn't leave
her journal out.

53:55.932 --> 53:59.068
We must return it immediately
before she notices.

53:59.068 --> 54:03.039
- Just look Damien,
it concerns you.

54:04.574 --> 54:07.143
- Of course it does, we're
engaged to one another.

54:08.344 --> 54:11.047
- Not if one were to believe
these words.

54:11.047 --> 54:12.949
She's known this stranger
barely a day

54:12.949 --> 54:16.319
and already she fantasizes
about running off with him

54:17.220 --> 54:18.721
and leaving you and I behind.

54:20.023 --> 54:21.124
Can you believe that?

54:22.058 --> 54:24.294
A handsome young
gentleman like you

54:26.162 --> 54:27.931
and she'd see you cast aside.

54:30.567 --> 54:31.968
- I'll talk to her, Eliza.

54:33.202 --> 54:36.839
- Nonsense Damien,
you can see the passion

54:36.839 --> 54:38.174
with which she writes.

54:39.275 --> 54:41.978
How long has she been thinking
of leaving you behind?

54:43.212 --> 54:48.184
What other men might have
engaged her lust

54:48.184 --> 54:50.587
after you were wed?

54:50.587 --> 54:54.557
- Then, what do I do?

54:54.557 --> 54:57.961
- You do still wish to marry
into this family don't you?

55:00.196 --> 55:03.066
You plan to stay here with me.

55:04.701 --> 55:05.602
- You know I do.

55:06.970 --> 55:10.607
- Then we must separate
them before this silliness

55:10.607 --> 55:11.641
can go any further.

55:12.642 --> 55:14.611
It's for the girl's own good.

55:17.347 --> 55:18.247
- How?

55:20.049 --> 55:21.484
- I have a simple plan

55:23.086 --> 55:27.090
but I need a brave, strong man
to help me.

55:28.257 --> 55:30.526
- I don't want to
hurt her Eliza.

55:32.095 --> 55:34.964
- Not her Damien, him.

55:50.513 --> 55:52.415
Dearest Agatha,

55:52.415 --> 55:53.816
I'm leaving Black Rock tonight

55:53.816 --> 55:55.485
and I wish to take you with me.

55:55.485 --> 55:57.186
- Are you coming
to get ready for bed Agatha?

55:58.021 --> 56:01.591
And I will come for you
at the strike of midnight.

56:02.425 --> 56:03.292
Tell no one.

56:04.727 --> 56:05.695
- Just one minute.

56:08.765 --> 56:13.736
- Love,
your visitor.

56:41.197 --> 56:42.665
- Come in Adriel.

56:50.740 --> 56:51.641
It is you.

56:54.077 --> 56:57.580
- I found something of
yours outside.

56:57.580 --> 56:59.048
- Something of mine you say?

57:12.729 --> 57:13.963
Do you know what it is?

57:15.398 --> 57:16.599
Of course you don't.

57:18.768 --> 57:20.636
Would you like to
find out I wonder.

57:22.505 --> 57:23.406
Of course you do.

57:26.442 --> 57:28.578
I can see the way you're
breathing Adriel.

57:29.946 --> 57:33.750
Your heart's beating fast,
I don't mind.

57:36.285 --> 57:40.056
You've been thinking about me
haven't you?

57:40.056 --> 57:43.092
Say it.

57:43.092 --> 57:43.993
- Yes.

57:46.929 --> 57:49.065
- Look at me, and say it.

58:03.579 --> 58:04.480
- What?

58:06.783 --> 58:07.717
- Slower.

59:04.941 --> 59:05.842
Do you trust me?

59:08.911 --> 59:12.481
Open your mouth wide and close
your eyes.

59:13.382 --> 59:14.283
Wider.

59:16.552 --> 59:17.453
Wider.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.676
- Meet me
in the cellar at midnight.

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.811
I've urgent news, Agatha.

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:20.316
- I'm not done with
you yet handsome.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:24.353
I'll be back, shortly.

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.248
Agatha?

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.247
Damien?

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.787
- You got my note.

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:07.823
- I got a note from Agatha.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.292
- Not Agatha.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.801
- I know why you've come
to this house.

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:20.836
And what you want
from this family.

01:02:20.836 --> 01:02:21.737
- Do tell me.

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.173
Tell me what I want Damien.

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:28.477
- I don't want you in this
house a moment longer.

01:02:30.112 --> 01:02:31.013
- You know what?

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.749
I think I'll stay a while.

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:44.093
- Agatha already seems
taken with you.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:47.663
- And Adriel, just you
watch the rest will follow.

01:02:49.131 --> 01:02:53.936
But if you like I can leave
that cold, stiff, old woman

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:57.873
you're so fond of, she's
all yours to play with.

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:03.646
- What is it that so strongly
attracts them to you I wonder?

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.482
- You don't have to wonder.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:12.822
- You're right, I could have
you right here if I wanted to.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:16.525
Nobody would know.

01:03:16.525 --> 01:03:20.763
I could chain you to the wall
and tell them you'd left.

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.933
- And there was me thinking
I was about

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.634
30 years to young for you.

01:03:27.736 --> 01:03:29.472
- It would be years before they
found you

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:33.976
and then night after
night I could return here

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:39.248
and we could do horrible,
pleasurable things.

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:45.821
- You know Damien, you're
making me very hard.

01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:51.527
- Can I feel?

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.301
No that's good.

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.304
You'll bleed out far quicker.

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:13.382
Violent desires wreak
violent rewards.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.967
- Evelyn you scared me.

01:04:31.967 --> 01:04:34.303
- You know where he
is don't you?

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.604
You know what's going on.

01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:38.174
I know that was your knife.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:40.442
It belongs to Sylus yes
but I've seen you with it

01:04:40.442 --> 01:04:42.178
these past weeks.

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:44.547
Are you trying to frame
him for some ungodly act?

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.550
- I'm afraid my aim is...

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.387
It's far more complicated
than that.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:53.889
- So you do know
about the knife.

01:04:55.257 --> 01:04:58.460
- I'm not going to lie to
you Evelyn, not to you.

01:04:59.995 --> 01:05:01.597
I'm only trying to protect you.

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:02.665
- From what?

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.266
Tell me what's going on.

01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:06.302
Tell me who the stranger is.

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:11.140
- Then at the very least tell
me where I can find my father.

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:15.044
- I can tell you he's
indeed left this house.

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.446
I'm doubtful he'll ever return.

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.715
- How can you say that
to me so cold?

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:21.984
I'm his daughter.

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:24.086
- Believe me when I say
it's better he is gone.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.487
- Better for who exactly?

01:05:25.487 --> 01:05:26.422
- For you Evelyn.

01:05:27.856 --> 01:05:30.326
Things happen in this
house that you do not see.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.095
Things you would
rather not know.

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.364
- Tell me.

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.270
- I wish I could.

01:05:42.504 --> 01:05:44.440
- I will not leave
until you tell me.

01:05:46.308 --> 01:05:47.376
I can keep a secret.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:53.249
If you don't I will tell
Mother and she'll punish you.

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:56.719
I see the scars she
leaves on your back.

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:58.187
- That was not a punishment.

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:01.624
That was done in pleasure by
your father.

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:07.162
You are too sweet to
understand these things.

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:10.165
- He beat you for fun?

01:06:10.165 --> 01:06:11.233
Is that what you're telling me?

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:14.236
- No Evelyn, it is a
fetish for him.

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.072
A sexual desire.

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:25.814
He strips me down, ties me to
the bedpost,

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:30.653
cuts me, burns me,

01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:35.724
and when he's hard and drooling
at the mouth like a hound

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.227
he has me.

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:42.931
I was hired for that
purpose and nothing more.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:48.804
- I, I didn't realize the
extent of his cruelty.

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:49.905
- I'm not finished.

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:54.543
You asked for the truth
and now you will hear it.

01:06:55.844 --> 01:06:57.980
I can handle his sick pleasures,

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.983
I could leave here
anytime I wanted

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:04.386
and believe me I've so
often thought about running,

01:07:04.386 --> 01:07:05.921
running before your
mother finds out

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.723
and has me sliced
open at the veins

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:14.563
but if I left Evelyn,
how would I ever see you?

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:19.935
- What does that matter?

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:21.036
- It matters because,

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.874
my heart has grown so
very fond of you.

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:30.779
I had not expected it but,

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:35.751
I've uncovered a kind of desire
I never knew I could feel.

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:40.823
Your father over time
could see my love for you

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.892
and how I despised
him so greatly.

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:48.564
There were no boundaries
to what that man will do

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:51.667
even to his own daughter, all
just to spite and control me

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:52.568
- Stop.

01:07:53.535 --> 01:07:54.503
I've heard enough.

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.388
- I've only tried to
keep you safe.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:16.591
I can't help the way
I feel for you.

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.395
It's put you in great danger.

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:26.100
Please Evelyn,
please understand me.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.372
- Evelyn.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.241
What are you doing out of bed?

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.943
- She said she loves me.

01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:37.546
And she tell me horrible
things about her and Father.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:38.747
- Get upstairs now.

01:08:40.482 --> 01:08:41.582
Now!

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:48.157
I have seen the way
you look at her.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.928
As if my own flesh and
blood could muster up pity

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:56.064
let alone love for an
ugly dog like you.

01:08:57.131 --> 01:08:59.501
You're done with this family.

01:08:59.501 --> 01:09:00.935
Do you hear me?

01:09:00.935 --> 01:09:04.206
With those beastly black ears.

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.107
You're out!

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:11.947
You'll never lay eyes on
my daughter again Cordetta.

01:09:20.087 --> 01:09:22.090
- I'm sorry Eliza
I didn't mean to.

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:50.786
- Drag that heap of waste out to
the road

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.590
and leave it for the wolves.

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:34.723
- What has she done to you?

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.091
- Get away!

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.327
Get away from me!

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:41.363
She's lucky she's your mother

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:43.165
or I'd stab her
in her cold heart

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.199
and watch her bleed.

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:47.536
- Leave her Evelyn.

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:54.943
- Is it done Damien?

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.085
What is this?

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:14.162
- No bigger than mine after all.

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.401
- I'm sorry Adriel.

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:57.539
I've let a devil into this house

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:02.444
and he has tempted you and
stained your innocence.

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:07.015
He has given you an illness.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.218
You're to stay in this room

01:13:10.218 --> 01:13:12.988
until I see fit for
you to leave.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:19.528
Stay in this bed and pray child,
pray for God's forgiveness.

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.069
You put it on darling,

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:34.342
and I'm not going
to take it off.

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:39.147
You can wear this shame
on your face Adriel

01:13:39.147 --> 01:13:41.450
for all of us to see.

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:49.391
I've brought you this,
you must be very hungry.

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.928
It's to remind you
that you've made

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:57.032
a terrible, terrible mistake.

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:20.889
It's all very touching
and romantic sweetheart

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:23.458
but I'm afraid you've
scared our house guest away.

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:25.393
- He's gone?

01:14:25.393 --> 01:14:28.764
- Not before he stole
the key to your room.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.599
- No he would never...

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.834
- I know the rejection will hurt

01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:37.072
but nobody can love a woman who
commits her heart to one man

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:40.776
yet writes pathetic poetry
about another.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:45.514
That was on his bedside, he
must have crept into your room.

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:47.716
I fear to imagine
what he was after.

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:59.961
- I have committed my
heart to no one.

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:03.198
You have done with
it what you desire

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:06.234
and offered me to a
man I care nothing for.

01:15:06.234 --> 01:15:08.436
- You will stay locked
in this room

01:15:08.436 --> 01:15:10.572
until you have
learned to be grateful.

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:12.107
- No Mother--

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:20.041
- I wanted to check
how you were doing.

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.614
I'm so, so sorry Cordetta.

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:29.351
- It's not your fault.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.454
If you had no
interest in me then

01:16:34.689 --> 01:16:37.125
you'll find me disgusting now.

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.029
I look like a monster.

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:48.803
- You of all people
are not a monster.

01:16:50.805 --> 01:16:53.074
You're brave and kind

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:57.345
and I realize I probably
owe you a great deal,

01:16:57.345 --> 01:16:58.947
at the very least an apology.

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:05.654
I'm sorry.

01:17:29.577 --> 01:17:32.047
You ought to be more
careful around your mother.

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:35.216
You don't understand
these pleasures.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.252
She does.

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:41.356
She'd have me starve to death
wearing that torture device.

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:44.225
- Then why did you put it on?

01:17:44.225 --> 01:17:45.460
- Because he asked me to.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:48.229
- Hm, I'm sure he did.

01:17:49.397 --> 01:17:51.299
And did you enjoy
wearing it for him?

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.243
It's alright, you can tell me.

01:18:03.044 --> 01:18:05.046
- Mother says I have an illness.

01:18:05.046 --> 01:18:06.481
- So what?

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:08.416
I have an illness too then.

01:18:08.416 --> 01:18:09.884
If that's what she calls it.

01:18:12.253 --> 01:18:14.990
But you stay away
from this stuff.

01:18:16.891 --> 01:18:20.695
You don't want to venture
so far, you lose your way.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.200
- Have you...?

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.168
- There's nothing to be
scared of.

01:18:27.168 --> 01:18:28.737
I found you tied to his bed,

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:31.172
I cut you free.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.075
- What is that Sylus?

01:18:34.075 --> 01:18:36.177
- Something of mine
I found in the attic.

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:39.781
Locked up with their
whole dirty past.

01:18:43.284 --> 01:18:44.552
It's where I found this,

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:47.455
it belonged to your
father you know.

01:18:49.557 --> 01:18:51.659
Let's say we had an agreement,

01:18:51.659 --> 01:18:56.364
that benefited both
our greatest fantasies.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:00.902
Oh I was older of course,
which he enjoyed

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.638
but more handsome back then

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:08.743
and he was the prettiest
boy, just like you really,

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:13.415
looking for someone to make
him a slave to their most

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.784
lustful and primal urges.

01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:18.953
He and your mother settled down

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:22.657
but the temptations were all
still there.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:27.028
- No child, your mother
would never have kept me

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:30.131
in this house if she
suspected we'd ever repeat

01:19:30.131 --> 01:19:31.166
the things we did.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:37.305
She proposed a simple remedy
and I agreed.

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:49.484
One way to guarantee
I'd stay away.

01:19:50.718 --> 01:19:53.288
But I would have given even more

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.789
to ensure I didn't leave him.

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.527
You stay in this room Adriel.

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:03.264
It's safer to stay
out of her way.

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:06.568
I will bring you
everything you need.

01:20:09.537 --> 01:20:13.708
- Sylus, do you know where my
father is?

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:15.777
- Yes.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:18.813
He's either in a lot of trouble

01:20:20.014 --> 01:20:23.918
or a lot of pleasure that
will get him into trouble.

01:20:23.918 --> 01:20:27.288
Old habits do die hard.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.860
- Sylus!

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.162
Sylus Scorpius!

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.965
Bring my children to me.

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:26.548
- Eliza get up.

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.516
It's Harkin he's returned.

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:33.521
- Ma'am, he has requested to
speak only to his children.

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.756
- Get off me!

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.057
Get off me!

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.325
- Don't make me Eliza!

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.827
- Let me speak to him,
let me talk to my husband.

01:21:39.827 --> 01:21:42.564
Damn you.

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:43.565
- Stay back Mother.

01:21:44.699 --> 01:21:46.501
He doesn't want you here.

01:21:51.839 --> 01:21:53.174
- What has happened?

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:54.642
Where have you been Father?

01:22:16.664 --> 01:22:18.499
Father speak to us please.

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.636
Tell us something, anything.

01:22:24.305 --> 01:22:28.676
- You don't know this my son.

01:22:28.676 --> 01:22:31.579
But in returning to this house

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:37.719
I have condemned myself to a
certain and rightful death.

01:22:40.688 --> 01:22:42.190
- What are you talking about?

01:22:44.425 --> 01:22:47.161
- I had to come back, I had to.

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:53.234
I couldn't go without
telling you one last thing.

01:22:55.336 --> 01:23:01.209
She knows.

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:06.214
Only her and Sylus.

01:23:06.214 --> 01:23:10.084
- My God can't you see he's
returned completely insane.

01:23:10.084 --> 01:23:11.586
- Silence woman!

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.354
- Let him speak.

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:19.994
- There is an imposter
in this house.

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:25.667
That woman is not your mother.

01:23:28.936 --> 01:23:32.974
We made an oath,
an oath never to tell.

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:39.247
But your mother, your real
mother died in this house

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:46.921
long ago and she would
have you believe her lies

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:52.593
even when I'm dead.

01:23:52.593 --> 01:23:55.029
- The man doesn't know
what he's talking about.

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:58.599
Surely you can see these
are the lies of a madman.

01:23:58.599 --> 01:24:00.568
- Enough Eliza!

01:24:02.136 --> 01:24:03.871
- We've seen the
pictures Mother.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.075
They must have been taken many
years ago

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.743
back when we were only children.

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:13.648
That leads me to believe that
Father is telling the truth.

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:14.549
- Pictures?

01:24:15.883 --> 01:24:17.051
Of what?

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.587
- I don't know,
some perverted sex cult.

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:24.292
- Damien take them
back to their rooms.

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:26.294
Just do it Damien,

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:28.196
I don't care whether you have to
drag them

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:31.099
kicking and screaming just
get them away from him

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.368
before he poisons
their minds anymore.

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:35.370
- Poisons their minds?

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:42.777
You would know a thing or two
about poisoning their minds.

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:51.352
Rotting Christ, she has let
the devil into this house!

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.094
- Just leave your father.

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:01.829
He is sick.

01:25:21.315 --> 01:25:22.483
- Agatha, Agatha.

01:25:24.118 --> 01:25:25.019
- Is it true?

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:29.490
What he said or has my
father gone completely mad?

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:37.432
- I cannot deny that the
man may well have gone mad

01:25:38.499 --> 01:25:41.135
but presently he
speaks the truth.

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:44.005
- But you told me that a
child had died in this house,

01:25:45.506 --> 01:25:48.810
Mercury, the girl
from the photographs.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.378
- No.

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:51.512
- No?

01:25:51.512 --> 01:25:53.381
Well then who was it?

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:56.451
- The little girl in the
photograph is you Agatha.

01:25:58.352 --> 01:26:00.288
Mercury is the serpent.

01:26:01.622 --> 01:26:04.225
- But you told me
a child had died.

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:08.129
- Your unborn sibling still
growing inside the womb

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:11.065
of Eliza's twin, your mother.

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:14.836
We can only suspect how the
creature got into her locked

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:19.373
room at night but the beast
ventured in all the same.

01:26:39.126 --> 01:26:43.231
That vile serpent slithered
up inside her in the night

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:47.168
curled up with the baby
growing in her womb

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:50.238
and feasted on it's half
developed fetus,

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:54.675
poisoning her sister from the
inside out.

01:26:55.576 --> 01:26:59.747
She died before they could
even uncover where the snake

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:04.252
had gone but when the blood
soaked creature wriggled out

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:07.922
from between the legs of
her cold, stiff corpse

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:11.459
everybody knew what
had happened.

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:17.265
A tragic accident they said,
though some suspected murder.

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:21.302
We locked her body in
your father's old trunk

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:23.538
and hid the damn thing
in the attic

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:26.440
along with the rest of
her sinful possessions

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.842
and prayed we could forget.

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:33.047
It took quite a toll on
Eliza the devil of a sister

01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:34.582
can be a most painful thing,

01:27:35.349 --> 01:27:39.253
especially when the creature
was her own.

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:55.303
- It came into my room.

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:57.038
A snake, a horrible snake!

01:28:11.118 --> 01:28:13.220
- There's nothing there Evelyn.

01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:14.188
There's no snake.

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.593
We have to leave this house.

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.328
It's not safe for us here.

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:22.096
- Mother would never let me.

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:23.731
- She's not your mother Evelyn.

01:28:25.666 --> 01:28:28.736
Your father has returned
with a malefic revelations.

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.304
I have no time to explain.

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.873
You must pack your
things tonight.

01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:39.113
We'll live, just the two of
us, far away from this place,

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.282
somewhere she'll never find us.

01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:43.818
You must do as I say.

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:50.291
There's just one more thing I
have to do.

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:56.731
- Almost two decades of living
a lie, as you had wished

01:28:57.765 --> 01:28:58.733
all ruined.

01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:03.270
Have you entirely
lost your mind?

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:08.242
- I must have to return
to these oppressive walls.

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:15.349
- Where have you been?

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:20.521
- Running but you can't
run from your sins Eliza.

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:21.722
- We made an oath.

01:29:22.723 --> 01:29:26.694
Do you care nothing for
the sacrifices I have made.

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.429
- They have grown up Eliza,

01:29:29.463 --> 01:29:33.501
they are old enough to
understand what we did

01:29:34.368 --> 01:29:35.803
and who we were.

01:29:38.105 --> 01:29:41.008
- And you don't think
they'll despise us for it,

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:43.110
you most of all?

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:45.046
- That is for them to decide.

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:50.284
I grow weary of your
reign over this family.

01:29:51.852 --> 01:29:56.924
It is the old dominatrix
in you trying to break out.

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:00.261
- That's just what you want
isn't it?

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:04.765
This whole facade to come
crashing down

01:30:04.765 --> 01:30:08.636
so you can return to your
diabolical ways.

01:30:08.636 --> 01:30:13.107
- I already have, long ago.

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:19.280
Where do you think I find
all these beautiful maids?

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:23.150
- You're an old man now Harkin.

01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:28.222
We have long past our prime
while living this dull pretense,

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.291
raising her children.

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:33.627
- And it was the very least
you owed her.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.397
- I'd rather be in the ground
with her

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.666
than stay here a moment longer.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.237
- That is easily
remedied my love.

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:47.374
- Perhaps I can take you
with me Harkin,

01:30:47.374 --> 01:30:51.479
perhaps we can dive
into the flames and burn

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:53.380
like the devils we are!

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:54.715
- Get your hands off him!

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:57.051
Let him go.

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:04.592
- Don't tell me you've
fallen in love with him too.

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:11.232
I know what the pair of you
have been up to behind my back.

01:31:13.934 --> 01:31:16.570
You and all the countless
maids before.

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:27.214
Those scars on your back
proved everything Cordetta

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.917
I have them too.

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:38.359
They may be old and faded
but the memories are,

01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:43.230
are still as vivid
as if it were,

01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:46.033
as if it were only yesterday.

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:50.171
- I despise him and everything
he's done.

01:31:51.972 --> 01:31:53.974
But he is mine to kill.

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:55.976
- So it was you.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.158
- Get away from her!

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:14.829
You may do these
vile things to me

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.932
but you will not lay
a hand on Evelyn.

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:23.437
Now you will leave this
house Master Whipley

01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:27.141
and if I ever see your
face here again

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:29.310
I will spill your guts across
this floor.

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:38.519
- Go on then Harkin, fuck off

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.821
with your black whore of Satan.

01:32:46.393 --> 01:32:50.531
- I made a promise to
Evelyn not to kill you,

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:53.834
not her mother.

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.137
Stay out of my way.

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:54.595
- Eliza.

01:33:57.364 --> 01:33:59.700
- Already you have
stopped calling me mother?

01:34:01.068 --> 01:34:04.004
Have you so swiftly forgotten
the years I mothered you

01:34:04.004 --> 01:34:05.906
and raised you?

01:34:13.747 --> 01:34:17.451
It's true you know, every damn
word of it.

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:21.555
Everybody looked to my
sister like she was some kind

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:23.157
of pure saint.

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:26.727
We weren't all
that angelic.

01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:30.230
When we were just girls
we'd go out on the street

01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:32.399
and offer ourselves for money.

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:37.638
The only difference being
I always enjoyed it.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.177
Even when they left me, bruised.

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.715
I loved the touch of their
tough hands

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:51.618
all over my young silk skin
right up until

01:34:51.618 --> 01:34:54.989
the warm wet slit
between my thighs.

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:59.493
Oh I was never going to
be one to settle down

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:02.296
with a husband I could love.

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:04.865
What I held onto in
my heart was variety.

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:11.505
A lady with my desires
gets bored, so easily.

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:14.842
Then I found Black Rock Manor.

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:21.048
A tranquil, grand paradise so
typically boring of my sister.

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:26.820
She was obsessed with money,
anything to better herself.

01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:31.725
She was a smart girl, far
smarter than me.

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:34.395
But she must've been tortured
by lust right up until

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:35.562
the day she died.

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:40.267
And Harkin, the man
she grew to love,

01:35:41.168 --> 01:35:43.370
he was different though.

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:46.407
I could see that the
moment he laid eyes on me.

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:52.146
I could see what he was
thinking even with my sister

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:54.248
stood right beside him.

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:57.818
For when darkness fell outside
this manor

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:59.453
an age old tradition,

01:35:59.453 --> 01:36:02.823
a burden passed down
by his father I think,

01:36:02.823 --> 01:36:04.658
ran riot in these walls.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:10.264
If only they could tell of
all the wonderful perversity's

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.932
that happened here.

01:36:11.932 --> 01:36:14.134
I suppose that's why
I always liked it.

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.038
I felt at home here.

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:24.244
With the help of my diamond
back rattlesnake, Mercury.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.782
Mercury I called it.

01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:35.222
I would put on a seductive
display of domination

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:40.294
and sadomasochistic pleasure
that would drive men wild

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:44.698
by the dozen, they'd
come from miles just to

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:49.770
watch me and have me all
under Harkin's jealous nose.

01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:53.173
The curse of twins is that
he'd never be able to hide

01:36:53.173 --> 01:36:55.976
the fact that he
found me irresistible.

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:59.179
I was my sister

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:03.383
but with all the benefits
a man could lust for.

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:07.988
She wanted children, a house,
a dull life

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:13.060
and I wanted men, as many as I
could have.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.697
And I wanted their breath and
their sweat

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:21.368
and every orgasmic fluid
they could pump into my body.

01:37:23.537 --> 01:37:28.408
And I wanted Harkin,
him most of all

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:31.912
because he belonged to her.

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:38.318
And even with everybody
at my feet I,

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:43.357
I needed him to want me.

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:49.163
And he did.

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:54.735
Despite the three
pretty children

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:57.137
and the fourth growing
in your mother's womb

01:37:57.971 --> 01:38:01.542
we gave each other every
kind of pleasure we wanted.

01:38:05.245 --> 01:38:07.948
Right up until the day she died.

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:18.392
If your father ever had a
heart it was truly broken

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:22.629
and he grew to hate me for it.

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.234
I began to miss her.

01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:32.239
And no matter how much
fucking I managed

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:35.242
and no matter how many times
he'd beat me

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:38.045
in a violent rage I was numb.

01:38:41.014 --> 01:38:44.551
- I think it's sad,
you have three children

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:46.253
and this is what
you think about.

01:38:47.621 --> 01:38:49.189
- You're not my children.

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:54.394
You'll always be hers.

01:38:56.296 --> 01:39:01.268
Wretched little orphans scuttling
about like lost insects.

01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:04.071
Waiting to be stamped on

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:07.107
by the cruel realities
of this world.

01:39:09.142 --> 01:39:11.178
- No one wants to listen
to your sick fantasies

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.145
you twisted witch.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.582
You're just a used up
old piece of furniture

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.050
that this house has claimed.

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:22.923
Fallen from sight underneath
the gathering dust.

01:39:43.243 --> 01:39:48.315
- A few too many possessions
in my wife's bedroom

01:39:48.915 --> 01:39:51.451
for a man engaged
to my daughter.

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:55.522
- Listen Master Whipley,
I'm leaving this house

01:39:55.522 --> 01:39:57.424
immediately I want no
part of this trouble.

01:39:57.424 --> 01:40:02.429
- Seems that marrying
into my family's fortune

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:08.502
comes at a much higher
price than you thought.

01:40:10.871 --> 01:40:15.409
But nowhere near as high
the price of playing the

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:19.513
accomplice to my wife's
desperate pleasures.

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:25.619
Oh I know she can be
quite the seductress

01:40:25.619 --> 01:40:26.753
when she wants to be.

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:32.626
You've crawled into the
wrong spider's web Damien.

01:40:32.626 --> 01:40:34.261
- Just stay back.

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:39.333
- Can we agree on a fair
punishment my greasy little fly?

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:47.007
Perhaps I could, stab you in
your throat

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:49.109
and throw your body down a well?

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:54.681
It's like a man once told me,

01:40:55.949 --> 01:41:01.021
violent desires reap
violent rewards.

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:44.331
- You came back.

01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:46.466
- I wouldn't leave you
here alone now would I?

01:41:46.466 --> 01:41:47.801
Agatha my love.

01:41:50.704 --> 01:41:51.638
Come to me.

01:42:48.328 --> 01:42:52.499
- Young Master Whipley does
not wish to see you ma'am.

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:54.768
- I have come to
make things right.

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:58.104
What I did was very unkind.

01:42:58.104 --> 01:43:00.207
I want to ensure
that he gets better.

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.775
- I'm making sure of that.

01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:06.680
- Well then, I've prepared
a cold jug of water for him,

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:09.683
I will at least keep the
pair of you hydrated.

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:31.438
- She's either realized
the errors of her ways

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.273
or she's deranged.

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:42.048
Either way you need to stay
hydrated for your wound to heal.

01:43:42.048 --> 01:43:44.117
- But I'm not thirsty Sylus,
please.

01:43:47.187 --> 01:43:48.522
- You should drink Adriel.

01:43:56.363 --> 01:43:58.965
- I want to thank you for
what you're doing for me.

01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:02.168
For all these years we've
been made to fear you.

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:11.044
Sylus!

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.851
Sylus!

01:44:58.925 --> 01:45:03.196
- Like a muddied spring
or a polluted fountain

01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:06.066
is a righteous man that
gives way before the wicked.

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:30.090
- Evelyn.

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:33.526
Evelyn my love.

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:40.433
Come and see your father.

01:45:40.433 --> 01:45:45.505
Just one last wish before
hell invites me in.

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.644
Evelyn.

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:56.750
Evelyn my sweetness.

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:11.197
- I warned you what I
would do if you returned.

01:46:11.197 --> 01:46:12.365
- I am ready.

01:46:13.199 --> 01:46:15.435
- Not until I have told you why.

01:46:15.435 --> 01:46:18.138
Why I came here from
the very beginning.

01:46:19.205 --> 01:46:24.277
See, when I was a little
girl I had an older brother

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:30.517
and he was hired by some
wealthy family to leave our home

01:46:30.517 --> 01:46:32.619
and work for them, far away.

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:37.691
One day, we simply
stopped hearing from him.

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:44.164
Nobody knew where he
was, nobody dared to ask.

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:48.401
He'd never leave his little
sister without a word.

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:51.805
I knew something terrible
had happened.

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:56.876
So when I reached
an appropriate age

01:46:58.411 --> 01:47:01.114
I went looking for this remote
manor house

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:02.115
where he'd served.

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:07.520
The word among the
other young girls spread

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.457
of your strange,
secretive rituals.

01:47:13.026 --> 01:47:16.329
I had to rub the hairs I
clipped from a dead mouse

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:19.999
between my thighs to finally
get that snake to come to me.

01:47:19.999 --> 01:47:22.936
There was no way I wasn't
going to be the one

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:24.204
to get into this family.

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:35.949
You do remember my brother.

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:40.253
- The boy was too
curious for his own good.

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:45.825
Saw too much,
and he was a thief.

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:52.332
So whether he liked it or
not we made him take part.

01:48:00.573 --> 01:48:05.612
Seven white men, Sylus
and I, all going at him

01:48:08.314 --> 01:48:13.153
like a rag doll, that's
what ended the boy.

01:48:15.221 --> 01:48:19.192
I recall the eyes rolling
in the back of his skull

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:23.897
after about three hours of it.

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:30.603
- And that Harkin Ripley is
why I came to see you die.

01:49:14.747 --> 01:49:17.617
- I remember when I had a
fine young body like yours.

01:49:19.118 --> 01:49:21.788
I'd envy anyone who got
more attention than me.

01:49:23.122 --> 01:49:25.058
That wasn't many though.

01:49:26.392 --> 01:49:30.730
Soft, smooth, unwrinkled skin.

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:36.636
It soon fades away darling,
like a wilted flower,

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.972
irreversibly rotting over time.

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:43.543
What a foul disease is age.

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:49.515
But all the more foul when
youth fades prematurely.

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:54.988
That's something I've helped
you with over the years

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:59.893
raising you girls whether
you thank me for it or not.

01:49:59.893 --> 01:50:02.862
You still have so much to enjoy.

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:07.901
Such pristine untouched
bodies to explore with.

01:50:09.802 --> 01:50:12.272
And what thanks do I get?

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:15.074
You throw it back in my face.

01:50:15.074 --> 01:50:18.244
Well I'm still the
one raising you,

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:22.415
you're still under my control

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:26.920
and I say you don't
deserve men or love

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:30.056
or any of the things I've
sacrificed to help you

01:50:30.056 --> 01:50:31.658
resentful creatures.

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:38.264
We'll leave this shut,

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:43.036
and if any man tries to have you

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:46.439
he'll tear one awful
hole of flesh

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:53.046
right between your thighs
that no man will ever want.

01:50:58.484 --> 01:51:01.220
It's my gift to you darling

01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:06.292
the gift of eternal innocence
so you'll never have to become

01:51:07.226 --> 01:51:12.265
like your wicked old whore
of an illegitimate mother.

01:51:31.117 --> 01:51:33.886
Evelyn, you come to me now.

01:51:33.886 --> 01:51:35.088
- Stay away from me.

01:51:35.088 --> 01:51:36.656
- Get out of our way.

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:37.991
We're leaving this house.

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:40.626
- You give me back my daughter!

01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:45.431
- Mother get off me,
you're hurting me!
