A small party.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.840
So? Have a good time..

02:23.200 --> 02:25.120
Remzi said you should come with us.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.640
That's funny.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.400
You're hilarious Arzum
(sounds from the stage)

02:29.760 --> 02:32.920
So, you mean while I, wonderful I,

02:33.080 --> 02:35.160
sing like a nightingale on stage

02:35.280 --> 02:39.280
John turns around and invites you
and that Tunahan bitch to a party?
(audience cheering)

02:39.520 --> 02:40.320
Is that it?

02:41.440 --> 02:44.160
Two bitches who flirt around to get a free drink?
(music from stage)

02:44.680 --> 02:45.960
Does that make sense?

02:46.040 --> 02:48.960
Why not? Different tastes, different colors..

02:48.960 --> 02:50.280
Meli: Colors?
Arzum: Besides..

02:50.280 --> 02:52.320
Who are you fucking kidding?

02:52.320 --> 02:55.280
Go tell the John I'm not coming, see what happens.

02:55.560 --> 03:00.480
Don't worry, I'm coming. I'm in the mood for some Champagne.

03:01.120 --> 03:06.120
Please, convey my regrets to Mr. Remzi.
For attaching two ugly bitches to my party

03:06.640 --> 03:10.440
No, no, no.. I think, it's a good idea.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.680
If I'm with two ugly bitches, I will look more attractive.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800

06:00.800 --> 06:02.200
What the hell is going on?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.920
I found it in the trash

06:04.520 --> 06:06.120
What do you mean in the trash?

06:06.280 --> 06:07.960
Some whore threw it in the trash.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.280
What whore?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.600
Its whore of a mother, who else girl?

06:14.320 --> 06:15.720
Unbelievable.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.160
Its little hands are freezing cold.

06:19.160 --> 06:25.160
She could've left it in a park or
something, someone could have found it.

06:25.160 --> 06:29.440
I tried to take off, but then it
was still crying, I couldn't bare it.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.560
Then what?

06:30.760 --> 06:32.080
What do you mean, then what?

06:32.320 --> 06:34.760
I rushed home before it turned into an icicle.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.720
What now? What the hell are we going to do with it?

06:38.400 --> 06:40.680
Play mothers and fathers?

06:40.680 --> 06:41.840
Oh, I don't know.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.480
It can stay for a while, we'll think of something later.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.800
Girlfriend, how do you turn this thing off?
(door creaks)

06:47.800 --> 06:50.880
It will be all quiet, when you wipe its ass and feed it.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.640
Mama

06:51.640 --> 06:53.880
Oh Madame, please shut this thing up.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.760
Aww.. You're upset.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.360
Aww, you have made a stink.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.680
Has it?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.200
Should we look?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.640
Of course you should, you morons.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.640
It won't tell us by itself, will it now?

07:11.960 --> 07:15.000
Ew, that's gross, it shitted itself.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.360
I'm taking you back where I found you.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.560
No, please. Over my dead body

07:20.000 --> 07:22.080
Oh, it's a boy.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.120
Evgenia, go warm up some water.
Let's clean his little bum.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.800
Make sure it's not too hot.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.960
You go warm up some milk.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.600
He must be starving.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.880
And bring my Raki as well.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.760
Poor thing..

07:39.440 --> 07:41.800
So she threw you out on the street, hey?

07:42.240 --> 07:43.840
She must've had a reason.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.920
But she didn't know how sorry she will be.

07:48.440 --> 07:53.120
I didn't know how bad I would feel,
when I gave away my little girl.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.560
I still miss her very much.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.160
Hey Madame, what are you saying to him?

08:01.440 --> 08:04.240
Oh nothing, I was asking about his mother.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.680
Where's the little one?

08:07.920 --> 08:08.680
Gone.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.400
What do you mean, gone?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.400
I left him on the street.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.640
In this cold?

08:19.120 --> 08:20.280
Are you nuts?

08:26.960 --> 08:28.280
You want to kill him.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.760
He's not in the cold anymore, someone took him away.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.440
Who?

08:35.240 --> 08:36.600
Some tranny.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.360
(baby giggles)
Wow that was quick, he was starving.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.480
He's too young to drink milk.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.800
Get some proper baby food and diapers too.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.480
Ok, it's time to burp him now.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.880
What?

08:55.880 --> 08:56.560
(baby farts)

08:56.560 --> 08:57.800
Oh, look at the little man..

08:58.280 --> 09:00.440
Our son is going to be a macho man.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.160
Hey Madame, how does it feel to be a granny?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.000
Cut the crap,

09:08.440 --> 09:09.840
burp your own kid.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.200
My own kid?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.520
It can't be mine,

09:12.720 --> 09:14.520
my hips are too narrow.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
(groans)

09:16.160 --> 09:17.880
He's your baby now.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.120
You saved his life.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.800
Sister, you're glowing with motherhood..

09:21.840 --> 09:24.960
It's great, you're a mother now and I'm an aunt.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.360
We have to give him a name.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.320
(nostalgic music)

09:33.960 --> 09:37.520
You are the head of the family, you name him.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.840
You'll be called Deniz

09:40.200 --> 09:42.440
You've had a bad start too.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.880
Your mother regretted she had you.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.400
I pray you'll end up well.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.880
Just like my Deniz.

09:49.920 --> 09:50.920
(seagulls squawking)

09:54.040 --> 09:56.600
(music ends)
Girlfriend, it's too bright out here.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.600
I'm not used to going out this early.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.080
Come on sister, move your ass, he's starving.

10:01.200 --> 10:01.960
Ok, ok.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.000
Make sure you buy the whole list.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.440
Yeah, yeah I will.. Stop nagging. Bye now.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
(birds chirping)

10:30.640 --> 10:31.640
(door closes)

10:34.120 --> 10:35.120

10:35.400 --> 10:36.400

12:22.760 --> 12:26.800
"The number you dialled is currently unavailable, please try agai.."

12:27.280 --> 12:29.040
Remzi: You never go home this early.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.680
What's been going on the past few days?

12:31.440 --> 12:32.480
you have a lover?

12:32.520 --> 12:33.680
You are nuts.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.480
I know, I know that you like young pretty boys

12:38.000 --> 12:39.440
Well.. It's up to you..

12:40.240 --> 12:41.640
You'll lose me, okay.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.320
It's that Tunahan bitch, right?

12:44.840 --> 12:46.240
The girl likes me. What can I do?

12:46.560 --> 12:50.360
I don't know what you can do,
but I shall scratch your eyes out.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.040
I will never trade you.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.840
Could I smell another rose?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.920
You'd even smell shit, if there was money in it.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.160
(laughs)
That hurt.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.840
How little you know me.

13:00.840 --> 13:01.960
(laughter)

13:04.560 --> 13:06.520
Meli quick, Deniz is dying.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.720
What's wrong girl?

13:07.800 --> 13:09.800
Deniz has got a very high fever.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.760
(ambulance sirens)
Where's the baby doctor, the baby doctor..

13:16.800 --> 13:18.400
My baby is dying.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.320
"EMERGENCY"

13:20.320 --> 13:25.120
Go to the second floor, turn left, second door on the left.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.680
(door opens)

13:34.600 --> 13:35.720
Lady, wake up.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.360
Where's the doctor?

13:37.560 --> 13:39.160
Where is the doctor?

13:39.240 --> 13:40.240
I'm the doctor.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.560
My baby is dying, he has a fever.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.760
Calm down

13:43.760 --> 13:46.840
While I examine him, you go and register.

13:46.920 --> 13:47.920
(baby groans)

13:49.480 --> 13:51.920
You stay with Deniz, I will do it.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
(door closes)

13:55.800 --> 13:59.200
Take his diapers off and lay him on his stomach.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.160
''NAME: M''
(ambulance sirens)

14:06.160 --> 14:07.200
(scribbles)

14:10.760 --> 14:12.160
''NAME: F''

14:15.560 --> 14:17.720
Doctor, what are you doing?

14:17.920 --> 14:19.200
I'm checking his fever.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.600
Have you already checked?

14:21.840 --> 14:22.640
No, but..

14:22.760 --> 14:25.360
Isn't there another way to check?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.360
"NAME: HUMAN"

14:32.360 --> 14:33.720
Doctor: Over 40 degrees..

14:34.320 --> 14:35.840
How long has the child had a fever?

14:36.120 --> 14:37.200
Don't cover him.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.800
I don't know.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.800
Did you notice the child have any convulsions?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.240
Like an epilepsy fit?

14:47.360 --> 14:48.920
I really don't know.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.440
(sighs)
He might have suffered a febrile convulsion.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.000
And if not it may happen in the near future.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.520
What's a febrile convulsion, doctor?

14:57.720 --> 14:58.760
High fever,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.640
can do some damage in the brain.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.640
Which can result in paralysis or another ailement,

15:03.800 --> 15:05.360
in other words, it's very dangerous.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.800
(sobs)
Lord help us.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.880
(sniffles)

15:09.000 --> 15:10.920
What is your relationship to the child?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.360
I'm his aunt.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.120
(door opens)

15:16.960 --> 15:18.800
What's wrong with him doctor?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.000
Whose baby is this?

15:21.400 --> 15:22.240
Ours..

15:22.360 --> 15:23.200
Yours?

15:24.160 --> 15:25.320
Where's his mother?

15:25.760 --> 15:26.400
We don't know.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.560
What do you mean, you don't know?

15:28.600 --> 15:31.480
I found him in the trash can, he was freezing so

15:31.480 --> 15:34.360
I took him home, we're looking after him.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.240
Did you inform the police?

15:37.440 --> 15:38.240
No

15:39.400 --> 15:40.520
You should have.

15:40.680 --> 15:44.400
In this country children without
parents are given to state institutions.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.920
Look doctor, I didn't know this.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.760
If I had known, I wouldn't have taken him.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.920
I swear, I wouldn't have.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.640
If we go to the cops, they'll beat us.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.200
(Evgenia whines and sobs)

15:59.600 --> 16:02.120
If you like, we leave him to you..

16:02.320 --> 16:04.440
You give him to the cops.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.240
Has he had his vaccinations?

16:09.360 --> 16:10.760
We don't know.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.240
Wait a minute, I'll get you the medicine.

16:13.480 --> 16:17.680
If I write you a prescription, you'll just end
up spending money you probably don't have.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.200
We're always given free samples.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.200
Wait for me.
(Evgenia crying)

16:26.040 --> 16:27.200
Stop crying, girl.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.000
Take this and hide Deniz in it.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.480
Get the hell out of here before the bitch comes with the cops.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.600
Don't use the main door, use one of the back doors.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.800
Get in a taxi and go straight home.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.200
(suspense music)

16:49.760 --> 16:51.720
Come on, go.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.880
(sirens)

17:18.920 --> 17:20.360
(heavy breathing)

17:41.800 --> 17:43.360
Taxi.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.920
(taxi breaks)

17:55.240 --> 17:56.720
(exhales a deep breath)

17:57.800 --> 18:02.080
Take me to Galata baby.
Step on it, I've got a patient waiting.

18:10.680 --> 18:11.720
There, you are.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.480
Here..
(plastic bag ruffling)

18:14.640 --> 18:18.360
Look, I thought it will be
best that you keep the baby for now.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.320
But you have to keep him under constant observation.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.880
Thank you, doctor.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.000
I wrote the instructions on the medicine.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.840
You have to get the fever down.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.960
Soak a towel in vinegar and put it on his forehead

18:30.160 --> 18:32.320
and keep an eye on him at all times.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.760
It's possible he'll have convulsions.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.280
If this happens, bring him to the hospital at once.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.200
I won't report you to the police on one condition,

18:41.680 --> 18:44.120
you will be in contact with me at all times.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.400
And bring the baby to my
private office on Friday at 10 A.M.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.320
You'll come on Friday, right?

18:53.200 --> 18:53.800
Promise?

18:54.080 --> 18:54.800
Promise.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.720
Look, if you do not come, this child may be harmed,

18:58.960 --> 19:01.800
and you will be legally responsible.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.280
(sniffles)

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
(door unlocks)

19:17.320 --> 19:18.320
(lets out a deep breath)

19:25.720 --> 19:28.600
(sighs)
Oh god, I'm dead..

19:30.440 --> 19:31.920
(exhales)

19:36.240 --> 19:37.240
What?

19:37.320 --> 19:39.520
Have you been playing doctor with the clients?

19:39.640 --> 19:42.440
Johns have sure changed over the years.

19:42.520 --> 19:46.360
In my time, they used to
drink Champagne from our shoes.

19:46.360 --> 19:50.160
At the most, they'd ask you to keep
your garters and stockings on.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.400
What the hell are you talking about, Madame?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
I've just escaped hell..
(door opens)

19:57.160 --> 19:58.560
Meli: Where have you been?

19:59.200 --> 19:59.680
Mama

19:59.880 --> 20:02.160
You will never believe what we've just been through.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.320
They almost took Deniz away from us.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.480
What happened? Spit it out.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.840
Early in the morning, Deniz had a fever.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.600
Of course, he was out on the street, freezing.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.800
Meli and I brought him to the hospital.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Oh , I was wondering where you came from.

20:19.120 --> 20:23.200
They told us, you have to go to the
cops when you find a baby in the street.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.520
Obviously, it's not a stray kitten, is it?

20:27.320 --> 20:30.120
If you knew, why didn't you tell me in the first place?

20:32.160 --> 20:33.600
(baby moaning)

20:35.040 --> 20:38.440
Evgenia, put the kid to bed.
If he's sick, he should be in bed.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.080
I'll do it. He's my son.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.600
The doctor said, he may have febrile convulsion.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.000
Febrile convulsion?

20:48.400 --> 20:50.480
Aylin: I wish I'd never done it.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.680
(sounds from the city)

20:58.640 --> 21:00.360
No use now.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.560
I'll get him back.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.200
It's been three days.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.160
How can you find him?

21:16.480 --> 21:18.880
I will find him, I know that.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.840
(sighs)
But I don't know what the
fuck I'm gonna do after I find him.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.000
I don't have a penny.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.840
I haven't worked for months now.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.960
You find the kid.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.400
Don't worry about the money.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.480
How?

21:39.680 --> 21:44.200
I still haven't recovered from the birth, I can't work.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.840
(Evgenia sniggers)

21:51.200 --> 21:53.520
Hey sister, what's with this?

21:53.840 --> 21:56.960
What's with this? What do you think?

21:57.120 --> 22:00.240
Do you think it was easy to get out
of that fucking hospital?

22:01.680 --> 22:04.720
We must bring this kid back
where I found him, right now.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.960
No, no, that doctor, she's
good. She didn't go to the cops.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.960
She gave us some medicine, and her card.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.600
We must take Deniz to her office on Friday.

22:15.080 --> 22:19.960
What? You went and found the doctor
instead of sneaking out the back door?

22:20.200 --> 22:21.760
The back door was locked.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.120
I had to use the main corridor.
We passed each other.

22:25.120 --> 22:31.760
She said, take a cloth soaked in vinegar,
put it on his forehead to drop the temperature.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.960
I know, as a kid, my mom used to
do that to me, when I had a fever.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.520
Sister, please.

22:38.520 --> 22:39.800
You can't bring him back.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.800
You'll have to kill me.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.920
Okay, I fucking will.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.720
Have you both gone insane?

22:51.720 --> 22:53.760
Are you trying to get me arrested?

22:53.880 --> 22:57.160
She didn't report us. I tell you, doctor is good.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.640
Like hell she is.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.120
I know her kind.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.040
She didn't turn us in because
there was no cop on duty.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.360
One was coming on duty as I was leaving.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.560
Don't fucking tell me what happened.

23:08.960 --> 23:13.400
I'll worry more and have a heart attack,
you know I have a heart condition.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.840
Oh my heart..

23:14.840 --> 23:19.560
As soon as you left, she reported us, that's for sure.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.400
And now the cops are about to come through that door.

23:23.240 --> 23:28.960
Because I was stupid enough to put our
address on the fucking registration form

23:29.080 --> 23:30.280
Oh my god

23:31.040 --> 23:32.960
The thing is I should have listened to you.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.520
You told me not to have the baby.

23:38.840 --> 23:39.960
Never mind.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.400
It's done now.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.320
I was hoping that the guy would marry me.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.360
I'm stupid.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.840
Who would marry a whore?

23:50.360 --> 23:52.120
I'm always fucking things up.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.760
I said never mind.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.200
Damn, I'm so stupid.

23:59.440 --> 24:05.440
That night, I decided to leave
him and just go. But I couldn't.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.160
Then that tranny found him.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.520
I thought, I shouldn't follow.
I should just forget my baby.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.320
Don't think about it.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
But I couldn't help myself.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.840
I was so confused, I lost her.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.040
But I know just about where she lives.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.400
I am gonna get my baby back.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.880
(sighs)

24:34.800 --> 24:39.280
If the tranny still has him, of course..

24:39.400 --> 24:41.600
Meli: I don't know the weather is warmer.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.400
I will leave him where I found him, maybe
that bitch of a mother will come and take him.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.680
What if she doesn't?

24:51.760 --> 24:55.560
No, no, how about this? I will leave him in a park.

24:55.800 --> 25:01.280
Maybe a nice family will take him, they will love him,
and together they will go to a new, happy life.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.160
What's the point, Saint fucking Meli?

25:04.200 --> 25:08.840
Why bother? You can hand him over when the
cops arrive, they can put him in a home.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.520
Oh, sure.

25:10.560 --> 25:14.800
And they will kindly ask, where the
fuck did you steal this baby from, freak?

25:14.880 --> 25:16.560
And beat the shit out of me.

25:16.560 --> 25:20.280
It will hurt two times more, if
you put that boy on the street.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.360
Oh shit Madame? Maybe you
were the luckiest whore in town,

25:23.360 --> 25:27.640
never touched by the cops, or the bastards
only beat the faggots, not the whores.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.440
Go fuck yourself.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.640
I'm going to bed.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.120
Sister, please,

25:37.360 --> 25:38.920
don't call her a whore.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.040
Christ,

25:40.320 --> 25:43.320
the whole fucking world
knows she was the best in her time

25:43.520 --> 25:46.480
All the old codgers in Pera still drool about her.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.840
Ah, Despina, you should have seen her.

25:49.560 --> 25:53.160
Still, you don't have to remind her.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.720
Sure, sure.

25:55.760 --> 25:59.800
Ok honey, you protect your mom.
I have to remember my place.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.560
After all, I'm just a tenant here.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.760
Sister, what kind of talk is that?

26:07.240 --> 26:10.520
You're not a tenant, you provide for us.

26:11.600 --> 26:15.720
She's not my real mama, anyways..

26:18.200 --> 26:20.000
(drawer opens and closes)

26:27.720 --> 26:32.880
The other day, in that store, I felt so ashamed.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.640
What store?

26:36.640 --> 26:38.080
The classy baby store.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.120
Why?

26:40.960 --> 26:44.560
All the women were so different. I felt cheap.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.920
Sister, what's going to happen with Deniz?

26:52.440 --> 26:55.800
Oh girlfriend, I'm dead tired.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.040
He can stay for today.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.120
It's too late anyway.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.200
We can't leave a baby in a park
in broad daylight, can we?

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
I will prepare the vinegar.

27:08.520 --> 27:09.760
Sister

27:10.120 --> 27:12.440
We can't give Deniz to the cops.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.680
They can't take good care
of him in the children's home.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
All those glue sniffing kids come from homes.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.360
You have a point.

27:22.360 --> 27:27.360
Let's think about it tomorrow.
First we get my son's fever down.

27:29.520 --> 27:33.760
Give him his medicine, then you
can sit and wait for the cops..

27:37.880 --> 27:38.480
(Sniffles)

27:38.840 --> 27:41.920
(Cello music)

28:02.120 --> 28:03.880
(Light switch on)

28:22.520 --> 28:24.320
Are you peeping on the fiddler again?

28:24.320 --> 28:25.720
(screams)

28:25.960 --> 28:26.720
(Heavy breathing)

28:26.720 --> 28:28.880
What's the matter with you girl? You scared me

28:29.280 --> 28:33.040
Oh God, I was so scared.
I didn't hear you come.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.680
(Laughter)

28:35.000 --> 28:35.640
(Deep breaths)

28:35.920 --> 28:37.320
What's going on?
(Loud laughter)

28:37.720 --> 28:39.440
Why are you screaming?

28:39.480 --> 28:42.320
Your scaredy cat girl scared the shit out of me.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.600
(Continuous laughter)

28:43.680 --> 28:45.480
I've been nervous all day,
(Cello music ends)

28:45.520 --> 28:49.320
and when sister came behind
me, I got scared and screamed,

28:49.320 --> 28:51.240
then she got scared and screamed.

28:51.240 --> 28:54.040
You're nuts. Both of you.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.560
(Continuous laughter)

28:57.400 --> 28:58.400
(Sighs)

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
(Sighs and laughs)

29:02.000 --> 29:04.640
(Exhales a deep breath and laughs)

29:06.040 --> 29:07.040
(Takes a deep breath)

29:09.560 --> 29:11.320
Cheating bastard.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.320
(Continuous laughter)

29:12.400 --> 29:15.680
Oh sister, I'm still shaking. All day,

29:15.920 --> 29:17.360
I was so scared.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.640
(Nervous Giggling)

29:18.760 --> 29:22.520
I thought everyone who passed
in front of the house was a cop.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.560
(Nervous laughter)

29:26.480 --> 29:27.480
(Key in lock)

29:28.400 --> 29:29.400
(Nervous laughter)

29:36.040 --> 29:37.040
(Nervous Laughter)

29:42.080 --> 29:43.280
Oh my God.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.520
What? Cops?

29:44.800 --> 29:45.760
No, no, no

29:46.440 --> 29:50.480
A woman is about to bust her boyfriend
with another woman in the street.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.600
There's going to be a cat fight.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.360
Don't be scared.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.080
The police wouldn't give a damn about a little baby.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.960
That doctor woman is exaggerating.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.560
Sister, she didn't say the
cops will come to our house, you did.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.520
Well..

30:07.040 --> 30:08.760
Did I know what I was saying?

30:08.960 --> 30:11.600
I was shit scared, first thing in the morning.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.000
(Shouting from outside)
What kind of man are you?

30:14.360 --> 30:15.280
(Shouting from outside)
Have you no shame?

30:15.280 --> 30:15.960
(Forced laughter)

30:15.960 --> 30:17.920
(Shouting from outside)
Who the hell are you woman?

30:17.920 --> 30:19.680
(Exaggerated laughter)

30:22.400 --> 30:25.600
(Loud forced laughter)

30:28.800 --> 30:30.440
You laugh..

30:31.080 --> 30:35.840
I'll see if you'll still be fucking
laughing, if anything happens to that baby

30:35.920 --> 30:36.920
(Takes a deep breath)

30:39.960 --> 30:41.760
(Shouting from outside)
I gave you everything.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.800
How could you do this to me?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.760
What the hell is going on?
(shouting from outside)

30:45.800 --> 30:49.760
They've started to fight, don't
look, the cops might have come.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.240
Don't worry, sister. The doctor will save Deniz.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.800
I hope so.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.280
I trust her.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.880
I feel I know her.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.680
Like shit you do.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.200
I'm sorry..

31:14.080 --> 31:14.840
Don't worry,

31:15.360 --> 31:17.920
I will take Deniz to that doctor.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.120
Girl, I want to do a little shopping.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.120
I want to look like the other mothers.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.640
You didn't go to that store.

31:30.880 --> 31:34.280
All those women looked at me like I
I was some cheap slut.

31:34.720 --> 31:40.200
Okay. Maybe I am, but they don't
have to push it in my face,

31:40.480 --> 31:41.760
Do they?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.040
Sister..

31:45.560 --> 31:50.120
That woman doctor, you
know what she did to Deniz?

31:50.640 --> 31:51.680
What?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.520
She put a thermometer up his..

31:55.720 --> 31:57.840
What are you on about?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.520
Put it up his..

31:59.520 --> 32:00.640
Up his what?

32:00.640 --> 32:01.840
Up his bum.

32:01.840 --> 32:05.560
She said that's how you take babies' temperatures.

32:05.680 --> 32:06.840
So?

32:08.960 --> 32:11.840
What if Deniz turns out like, us?

32:14.240 --> 32:18.120
What, you're really going mad, girl.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.640
If they stick thermometers into baby boys asses,

32:21.720 --> 32:23.520
then all the men would be gay.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.600
Think of what the world
would be like, if all men were gay.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.400
Heaven on earth.
(chuckles)

32:31.960 --> 32:33.440
You can make fun of me.

32:33.680 --> 32:37.840
If my father hadn't taken off with that woman to Beirut,

32:38.360 --> 32:40.920
I wouldn't have ended up like a girl.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.320
What woman?

32:42.440 --> 32:47.080
He had a fling with a revue
girl who came to work in Istanbul.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.720
He went with her when she moved on.

32:54.760 --> 32:59.200
If he had been around, mama
couldn't have raised me as a girl.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.600
Why did she raise you as a girl?

33:01.600 --> 33:05.200
Men are not loyal, she used to say, they always leave.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.120
Because my father did, I guess.

33:08.840 --> 33:13.480
Girls are loyal to their mothers,
she said, they look after them.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.960
My real name was Evgeny.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.200
She changed it to Evgenia.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.840
She's right you know, men are disloyal bastards.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.800
When I was young, I thought I was a girl.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.720
We were lifting up our skirts
to take a pee, and that was it.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.640
The girls never played with me again.

33:37.640 --> 33:42.400
You should have played with the
boys, that would have been more fun

33:46.440 --> 33:48.920
Forget about it.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.120
Oh come on, don't be sad.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.720
I think it's God's work you are gay.

33:54.920 --> 34:00.000
Neither your mother, nor a thermometer
up your ass can make you gay.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.160
It's our genes.

34:03.680 --> 34:07.360
But Madame wasn't very thoughtful, though.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.360
I'm not talking about Madame.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.880
My real mother, I told you.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.200
Madame: Evgenia love, can you fetch
me my water jug from the kitchen?

34:17.200 --> 34:18.240
I will mama.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.800
Madame: Better still, just bring me a glass of water.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.600
Sure, mama.

34:27.440 --> 34:32.360
But, she really has been a mother
to me, more than my own mother.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.200
The doctor will see you now.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.520
(Door closes)

35:01.200 --> 35:02.120
Hello.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.440
Hello, doctor.

35:03.760 --> 35:04.960
Please lay him there.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.720
Sh, sh, sh, sh

35:13.480 --> 35:15.080
You've changed a lot.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.400
That's how I dress for work.

35:17.400 --> 35:22.680
I never realised my clothes looked so
strange to other people, until I found the baby.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.040
What do you do?

35:24.040 --> 35:26.960
I sing at Madame Margot, a night club.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.440
Madame Margot?

35:28.440 --> 35:29.720
It's in Suadiye.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.080
Why don't you come one night? be my guest.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.880
So, how's the boy with my name?

35:34.880 --> 35:35.920
Your name?

35:35.920 --> 35:36.560
(Door handle)

35:36.560 --> 35:41.840
Deniz.. Can you come to my office when
you're done with your patient, please?

35:41.880 --> 35:43.160
Sure.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.680
Evgenia has your card.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.280
She only gave me the address.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.000
I didn't know your name.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.560
Is Evgenia a relative?

35:55.600 --> 35:56.520
No.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.960
I'm his mother's tenant.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.600
But we have become like family.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.000
I think he loves the baby more than you do.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.480
You were ready to hand him to the police at the hospital.

36:07.640 --> 36:11.080
I didn't want to get into trouble because of him.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.920
I didn't want him to end up in the street.

36:13.920 --> 36:20.560
Evgenia keeps telling me that if we turn him over to
the cops, he'll grow up to be like those glue sniffer kids.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.040
You can dress him.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.720
I still don't know your name?

36:33.880 --> 36:34.920
Meli.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.680
What an interesting name?

36:37.240 --> 36:38.760
It's not my real name.

36:38.880 --> 36:43.480
When I first started, the girls in the
club said singers should have a stage name

36:43.480 --> 36:45.400
and named me Mehtap.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.760
But Madame, my land lady I mean, didn't like it.

36:48.760 --> 36:53.240
She said: what kind of name is Mehtap?
Sounds like a cheap belly dancers name.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.160
So she named me Melancholy.

36:55.720 --> 36:56.600
How romantic.

36:56.600 --> 37:00.080
But, because it's long, everyone calls me Meli for short.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.240
Listen Meli

37:01.240 --> 37:03.040
You have to be really careful.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.440
You remember what I said when we first met?

37:05.720 --> 37:07.880
Sure doctor, we're really careful.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.320
Bring him to me once a week.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.040
See you next week, then.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.480
Doctor?

37:20.560 --> 37:21.760
How much do I owe you?

37:22.400 --> 37:23.600
You don't owe me.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.720
I would also like to contribute to Deniz's future.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.960
Thank you.

37:32.480 --> 37:34.200
Who was that for god's sake?

37:34.240 --> 37:35.560
A transvestite.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.880
What, he had a child?

37:38.080 --> 37:39.880
(Giggles)
No, he found him in the street.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.240
Found him in the street?

37:41.960 --> 37:45.760
Deniz, have you gone mad? You talk like
it's a piece of discarded furniture

37:45.760 --> 37:48.000
that you can just pick up and take home.

37:48.920 --> 37:53.000
Some people are treated like that
in this world. Street furniture.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.320
Left in the street to live without any purpose or hope.

37:58.120 --> 38:01.120
Some woman left her baby in the
street and he found the baby.

38:01.320 --> 38:05.920
The baby had high fever. So, he and another
homosexual friend brought him to the hospital.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.760
I fear a febrile convulsion
may or may have occured.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.320
So, I offered to help.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.120
Did you notify the police?

38:13.400 --> 38:15.680
I thought of calling them, but then I didn't.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.640
Why?

38:17.160 --> 38:19.080
I knew what would happen next.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.920
They would send the baby to a state home,

38:20.920 --> 38:25.560
then a couple of underpaid, undereducated
childcare workers would not be able to cope with him

38:25.560 --> 38:27.600
and the other 100 kids in their care.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.560
Worse than that, when he's 11, they
will treansfer him to a youth home

38:30.560 --> 38:35.800
Where he'll meet torture, sex abuse, drugs..

38:35.800 --> 38:37.040
Deniz.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.800
This is so irresponsible.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.520
You are a doctor.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.360
Just a moment,

38:42.840 --> 38:44.560
I hope you didn't call me here to lecture me,

38:44.560 --> 38:47.200
because I have a lot of patients out there waiting.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.680
When I came to your office, I didn't know
you were an accomplice to a transvestite.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.240
Suzan, will you please cut it short.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.240
Okay.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.920
I just spoke to Mother on the phone.

38:59.160 --> 39:02.160
She told me Uncle was in Istanbul recently.

39:02.520 --> 39:06.160
When I told her I didn't know, she was very suprised.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.000
Did you know?

39:08.560 --> 39:09.120
Yes..

39:09.200 --> 39:11.440
Dad paid me a short visit.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.960
Why wasn't I informed?

39:14.160 --> 39:15.880
Did he not want to see me?

39:16.320 --> 39:17.040
I don't know.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.400
He was here for some business

39:18.400 --> 39:21.400
and happened to pass by the
hospital and dropped in briefly.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.160
We talked a little, then he had to leave, that's all.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.120
What did you talk about?

39:26.240 --> 39:27.920
Why didn't you even mention it?

39:28.120 --> 39:31.480
It wasn't anything important, Suzan. I forgot to tell you.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.480
Now with your permission,
I have patients to attend to.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.400
Meli: We just don't know what love is.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.200
Why don't we?

39:41.680 --> 39:42.400
I don't know.

39:42.680 --> 39:46.200
Maybe because no one has
ever loved us since we were born.

39:46.320 --> 39:51.240
Come on, mothers and fathers
always love their children.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.920
Yeah, right, sure.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.200
My father loved me when he threw
me out of the house, when I was seven.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.360
Why would he do that?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.760
Because his best friend raped me.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.000
He said he couldn't look at
me without thinking about it.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.080
He couldn't live with the shame.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.560
What did your Mom do?

40:10.680 --> 40:12.360
What could she do?

40:12.680 --> 40:15.160
She agreed with him as always.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.720
God, it's stupid.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
Stupid?

40:18.080 --> 40:20.720
Stupid is not the word, it's selfish.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.720
Why should she give up her peace and quiet?

40:24.080 --> 40:28.440
If I had stayed, he would have remembered
the incident every time he saw me.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.360
Then he would get angry and take it out on her.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.560
Mothers don't love their children.

40:33.920 --> 40:37.720
They just bear them to satisfy their own selfish insticts.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.320
Put the kid in his bed.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.520
It's late.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.480
Madame is upset.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.960
She's realised how selfish she
was to raise you like a girl.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.720
Come on sister, I told you, she's not my real Mama.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.320
Like shit you did, you told me nothing.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.920
You just keep saying she's not your mother.

41:04.680 --> 41:09.360
I can't ask the details not to
upset you, but I am dying of curiosity.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.960
Will you just fucking tell me and get it over with?

41:14.440 --> 41:15.440
(sighs)

41:15.760 --> 41:18.240
But, you will never tell Mama.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.440
I won't, go on.

41:22.600 --> 41:25.760
My Mama and Madame Despina were really close friends.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.760
She used to always come over and comfort Mom.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.560
Why would she comfort her?

41:31.040 --> 41:35.280
After my Dad took off, Mama was in mourning.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.560
She used to cry every day.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.480
Poor thing, that's the dark side of love.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.320
That's what Mama Despina used to say.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.120
She would say: good for
nothing bum, took all your money

41:47.120 --> 41:51.680
and now with this hopeless love,
he's taking all your beauty away.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.880
Was your Mom a whore, too?

41:53.880 --> 41:57.680
I don't know, no man ever entered the apartment

41:58.160 --> 42:01.160
but, I don't think she was an angel.

42:01.440 --> 42:06.240
Otherwise, where could she get money to buy this apartment?

42:07.120 --> 42:09.840
How could Dad take her money?

42:10.440 --> 42:11.320
True.

42:11.440 --> 42:15.440
She didn't have any relatives
that I knew, only Mama Despina.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.080
I think she was providing for us at the time.

42:19.400 --> 42:23.920
Sometimes, she used to come with this little girl,

42:24.040 --> 42:28.080
she had green eyes, fair hair, she was nice.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.440
We used to play.

42:29.600 --> 42:32.160
Then, she disappeared one day.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.960
What happened to your real Mom?

42:33.960 --> 42:36.240
One day, there was a lot of joy.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.560
Mom found out where Dad was.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.840
He had opened a bar in Beirut.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.240
She said: we are going.

42:44.840 --> 42:47.280
She put the house up for sale.

42:47.400 --> 42:51.440
Mama Despina said: don't be
crazy, you will ruin the childs life.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.720
She's right. Then?

42:54.040 --> 42:57.360
Then, Mama Despina bought the house from my Mom

42:57.760 --> 43:03.240
and she wouldn't let me go,
she took care of me and looked after me,

43:04.040 --> 43:04.120
but she never told me she bought the house.

43:04.120 --> 43:08.000
but she never told me she bought the house.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.440
She always says: this is your house.

43:11.560 --> 43:12.560
And your Mom?

43:12.680 --> 43:13.880
She went to Beirut.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.480
That's why I think Mama Despina bought the house.

43:17.640 --> 43:21.800
Otherwise, where would mum have
found the money to pick up and go?

43:22.040 --> 43:23.520
Haven't you heard from her?

43:23.520 --> 43:25.400
Yes, she sent a letter.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.760
She had found my Dad.

43:27.880 --> 43:29.880
She said they were happy.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.360
She said they would come and get me soon.

43:33.920 --> 43:37.720
Then, no more letters, no more news

43:38.160 --> 43:41.080
and a war started in Beirut.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.600
Maybe she died.

43:46.520 --> 43:49.720
See? Another example of selfishness.

43:50.040 --> 43:52.120
Mothers don't have the right to die.

43:52.120 --> 43:55.160
If your'e going to die, why have children?

43:56.320 --> 43:57.800
(sighs)

43:58.160 --> 44:01.480
Where did this tranny disappear to?

44:03.800 --> 44:06.200
You can't find those people during the day.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.720
They work at night, and sleep all day.

44:10.160 --> 44:16.000
We have to look for him at night or very early in the morning.

44:16.800 --> 44:17.600
Of course.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.600
Yeah.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.480
Stupid me.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.360
How couldn't I think of this?

44:25.080 --> 44:28.320
It was 4 in the morning, when she found my baby.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.920
Aylin: She was going back home from work.
(dance music playing from club)

44:40.120 --> 44:41.320
You're leaving early again.

44:41.320 --> 44:42.280
(cries out)

44:42.320 --> 44:44.880
It's you Remzi. You scared the hell out of me.

44:45.040 --> 44:45.920
What's up?

44:45.920 --> 44:47.040
Where are you going?

44:47.120 --> 44:49.440
I feel a little sick, I told the boss I..

44:49.440 --> 44:50.440
You are sick, hey?

44:50.880 --> 44:52.240
Who are you kidding?

44:52.240 --> 44:54.360
You have found someone new, haven't you?

44:54.360 --> 44:56.800
Don't start with this bullshit again, Remzi.

44:58.760 --> 44:59.800
Look, Remzi,

45:00.120 --> 45:01.360
I'll be frank.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.440
I have to change my life.

45:03.440 --> 45:04.680
Now..
Remzi: Now what?

45:04.680 --> 45:05.400
Look..

45:06.560 --> 45:10.560
The last few months, I have a completely
different kind of love in my life.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.440
What do you think I am? A schmuck?

45:13.200 --> 45:14.600
Please don't get nasty.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.280
You've got me wrong.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.920
You get me wrong, baby.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.440
I won't let someone else take your money, okay?

45:19.440 --> 45:20.080
Damn you.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.520
It's just the money hey?

45:21.720 --> 45:24.440
At least don't say it to my face, you bastard.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.400
(Screams)

45:26.400 --> 45:27.760
Don't hit me.

45:27.800 --> 45:28.800
(Screams and Slapping)

45:29.840 --> 45:31.680
(running foot steps)

45:31.800 --> 45:33.240
(crying)

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
(key in door)

45:55.640 --> 45:57.160
I found the tranny.

45:57.440 --> 45:58.160
Great.

45:58.160 --> 45:59.880
Does he still have the baby?

46:05.680 --> 46:07.040
(hard slap on the back)

46:07.960 --> 46:08.520
Come here.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.760
Sit down.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.840
Listen loser.

46:17.520 --> 46:20.840
I told you I'm in a hurry to finish with this joint,

46:21.040 --> 46:24.440
so I won't waste time with you as well, you hear?

46:25.400 --> 46:27.640
How will she go on stage like this?

46:27.760 --> 46:29.000
I'm sorry, boss.

46:29.200 --> 46:32.080
She hit me you see, I lost control.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.480
Hear me out, faggot.

46:36.840 --> 46:42.120
I don't go around hitting people,
like you do. If you catch my drift?

46:42.600 --> 46:46.280
Believe me, boss, I'm really sorry, I really regret it.

46:47.720 --> 46:49.520
Please forgive me darling.

46:49.720 --> 46:52.000
(sobbing)
Believe me, I really regret it so much.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.240
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

47:12.720 --> 47:15.440
Perverts, the bunch of them.

47:27.960 --> 47:31.240
Mama, are you taking another trip through nostalgia?

47:31.680 --> 47:34.720
The sun of reminiscence never sets, Evgenia,

47:35.840 --> 47:43.000
I can now see that I have lived such
a mad,sad, but just as happy life.

47:46.680 --> 47:50.560
Don't upset yourself, you don't want another heart attack.

47:50.840 --> 47:56.920
Life has no meaning without the sorrow
of the past that will never return.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.360
You're also drinking too much mama.

48:03.360 --> 48:06.360
Well, the doctor says it's good for me.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.600
It opens the veins.

48:08.920 --> 48:11.200
I will go and wake Meli up.

48:11.400 --> 48:13.720
We'll take Deniz to the park.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.360
Pick me up a bottle of Raki on your way back.

48:25.520 --> 48:26.520
(door opens)

48:28.480 --> 48:32.480
Sister, I forgot my sunglasses, go get them.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.320
(door opens)

48:37.200 --> 48:39.880
The bitch has really settled in now.

48:40.880 --> 48:41.880
(door opens)

48:46.440 --> 48:48.600
(birds singing)

49:15.600 --> 49:16.640
Don't look, girl.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.360
What do you see in that fiddler? I never know.

49:19.560 --> 49:23.160
It's not a fiddle sister, it's a cello or something.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.640
Cello, schmello

49:25.000 --> 49:26.760
They're all fiddles anyways.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.240
Oh come on, sister. Give me a break.

49:29.240 --> 49:31.760
(children laughing)

50:02.480 --> 50:05.040
Look at that woman sitting alone over there.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.080
I think she is watching us.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.960
So what? everybody stares at us.

50:09.960 --> 50:14.160
No, this one's watching us differently. Look carefully.

50:23.400 --> 50:27.000
No, look, she's going anyway.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.680
She kept looking at Deniz.

50:35.880 --> 50:38.160
She will give him the evil eye.

50:39.080 --> 50:40.880
(knocks on wooden bench)

50:43.760 --> 50:46.160
(children playing)

50:52.440 --> 50:54.440
Oh shit, Mama's Raki

50:54.520 --> 50:57.120
Girl, that's the woman in the park,

50:57.120 --> 50:58.600
she's following us.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.440
Come on sister, what the hell?
(suspense music)

51:00.440 --> 51:02.080
Come on, girl.

51:26.200 --> 51:28.320
(suspense music ends)

51:31.000 --> 51:34.760
(mischievous music)
Fuck the stupid woman, let's go get Madame's Raki

51:35.400 --> 51:38.440
We could get it from Husam's store.

51:38.440 --> 51:42.840
No, no, we will get it from
Mahmud, his Raki is very good.

51:44.480 --> 51:47.640
And fuck the fiddler of yours, too. Come on.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.440
(baby laughs)

51:52.960 --> 51:54.240
(music ends)

51:55.600 --> 51:57.040
I found my son.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.000
He's still with the tranny.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.760
I have great news, too.

52:01.760 --> 52:03.320
I'm going to have an exhibition.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.440
A gallery called.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.480
He has grown up so much.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.200
Great.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.040
You see, everything is looking up.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.840
He looks happy

52:10.840 --> 52:12.760
and his health seems to be okay.

52:13.200 --> 52:15.040
God bless that tranny.

52:16.600 --> 52:17.600
Oh..Ah

52:17.920 --> 52:18.920
(laughs nervously)

52:18.960 --> 52:20.920
It's so lovely.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.880
Does it suit me?

52:23.000 --> 52:27.960
Of course, you are really
beautiful. Anything will suit you.

52:30.320 --> 52:32.240
Thank you very much.
(baby giggles)

52:32.240 --> 52:33.920
Thank Evgenia for me.

52:33.920 --> 52:36.240
Thank you, little boy with my name.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.600
See you next week doctor.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.360
Meli..

52:45.400 --> 52:47.400
You love him now, don't you?

52:48.800 --> 52:53.400
Yes doctor. Very much. More than anything.

52:53.960 --> 52:56.840
Listen, I live directly above the clinic.

52:57.200 --> 53:02.080
Let me give you my number, if anything
comes up you can call me anytime.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.400
There you go.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.000
Thank you.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.480
(Suzan laughing)

53:09.840 --> 53:11.600
Disgusting.

53:13.520 --> 53:14.680
Maybe,

53:14.920 --> 53:17.520
but it's not the blouse that counts, it's the thought.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.200
That's why I still see him.

53:21.040 --> 53:24.680
Just the love he gives to a baby who was
thrown on the street by his own mother,

53:24.680 --> 53:27.920
shows that he's more human than many people I love.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.040
What are you trying to say?

53:30.600 --> 53:32.640
Are you insinuating that I'm less?

53:32.760 --> 53:34.840
No Suzan, of course not.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.480
I'm sorry, I'm a bit distracted.

53:37.640 --> 53:40.320
I can see that, that's why I asked.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.840
Why don't you talk to me?

53:43.360 --> 53:46.000
Has it got anything to do with Uncle's visit?

53:46.240 --> 53:48.200
No.. I told you.

53:48.200 --> 53:52.040
Dad was here for business, our
meeting was a coincidence.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.240
Infact,

53:53.760 --> 53:56.640
there's no reason why I should be distracted.

53:59.760 --> 54:01.920
Maybe, there is.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.480
I think I know why I'm all nerves.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.320
There's this man.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.200
A surgeon.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.120
And?

54:11.200 --> 54:13.120
And, I like him.

54:13.280 --> 54:14.720
What's his name?

54:15.160 --> 54:15.760
Jan.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.920
I have two tickets for a concert on Saturday night.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.160
Classical music.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.440
If you don't like it, we can go somewhere else.

54:22.520 --> 54:23.960
I like classical music.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.880
What are you doing, girl?

54:33.880 --> 54:35.400
I'm hanging the curtains.

54:35.440 --> 54:39.400
I open the window a bit and they dry in no time.

54:40.000 --> 54:40.880
Let me help you.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.240
No, no, you'll be late for work.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.080
I have time,

54:44.080 --> 54:45.880
I don't want to go to work, anyway.

54:46.440 --> 54:47.120
Why?

54:47.800 --> 54:50.200
It's Saturday, the club will be packed.

54:50.200 --> 54:52.920
Have to entertain the crowd till morning.

54:53.880 --> 54:57.400
It's weird with Remzi, after that fight..

54:57.400 --> 55:03.080
(screams and crash)

55:03.080 --> 55:05.480
(groaning)

55:06.000 --> 55:08.840
What are you trying to do girls? Wreck the house?

55:08.920 --> 55:11.400
Don't shout, Mama, you'll wake Deniz.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.720
Are you joking?

55:12.720 --> 55:17.720
My shout is nothing compared to the noise you've made.

55:17.760 --> 55:21.600
Oh my god, it took me ages to put him to sleep.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.880
(heavy breathing)

55:28.200 --> 55:29.360
Ah..

55:33.240 --> 55:36.320
Thank God, he's still asleep.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.360
What's the matter?

55:41.800 --> 55:42.840
(Whispering)
He is deaf.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.440
Who's deaf?

55:44.600 --> 55:46.840
Who else girl? Deniz.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.520
The expected disaster has struck.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.160
(loud crying and wailing)

56:02.120 --> 56:03.600
We are doomed Madame.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.200
What's wrong?

56:05.200 --> 56:05.800
(crying)

56:05.800 --> 56:07.120
Deniz, Mama.

56:07.240 --> 56:10.000
Don't drive me mad, girls.
What's wrong with the kid?

56:10.080 --> 56:12.800
He's maimed, Madame, he's gone deaf.

56:13.480 --> 56:16.160
He won't be able to speak all his life

56:16.360 --> 56:19.720
My poor baby will live in a silent world

56:20.000 --> 56:23.760
not hearing a sound, not speaking a word.

56:23.760 --> 56:24.880
(wailing)

56:25.120 --> 56:26.920
You said he's gone deaf.

56:27.400 --> 56:28.960
Why can't he speak?

56:28.960 --> 56:34.080
Idiot. How will he be able to
learn how to speak, if he can't hear?

56:34.120 --> 56:36.680
(wailing)

56:39.800 --> 56:41.320
For shit sake.

56:41.520 --> 56:42.840
Will you tell me what's going on?

56:42.960 --> 56:45.600
Madame, Deniz didn't wake up with all that noise,

56:45.800 --> 56:46.680
he's gone deaf.

56:46.680 --> 56:48.120
Oh come on.

56:48.200 --> 56:50.120
How did you come to that conclusion?

56:50.400 --> 56:53.680
We didn't, Madame, the doctor already told us that

56:53.680 --> 56:56.520
high fever could have done some damage to the brain.

56:57.160 --> 57:00.000
She was expecting some disorder anytime.

57:00.000 --> 57:05.160
Bullshit. Then you can take him
to her, she can examine the child,

57:05.440 --> 57:07.120
see if he's deaf.

57:08.120 --> 57:10.480
What, are you doctors now?

57:11.120 --> 57:12.200
Thank you, Madame.

57:12.440 --> 57:13.720
You are so clever.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.480
Where the hell did I put her number?

57:18.640 --> 57:24.360
Meli, please. Stay calm. What's the
point of bringing the child here?

57:24.360 --> 57:26.280
There's nothing I can do now.

57:29.560 --> 57:32.440
Meli. You're being ridiculous.

57:33.080 --> 57:35.880
I said, bring him to the hospital on Monday.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.040
Calm down.

57:37.040 --> 57:38.320
Good night

57:40.520 --> 57:42.000
Damn woman.

57:42.200 --> 57:43.920
She's playing dirty on me now.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.360
Would you believe that?

57:47.760 --> 57:51.200
Fuck my brains, I will never learn.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.240
I trust everybody.

57:56.160 --> 58:01.200
You remember you said to me she was good
woman? And I said like shit she is, remember?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.240
I told you, then I went and believed her.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.200
Could you imagine that?

58:06.400 --> 58:07.720
Fuck my brains.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.040
What shall we do now?

58:10.320 --> 58:12.440
Meli, Pediamu (my child)

58:12.720 --> 58:17.040
Calm down, be rational.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.840
Tell us, what did she say?

58:21.080 --> 58:23.080
There's nothing to be done now, she said.

58:23.080 --> 58:26.000
She said, we should take
Deniz to the hospital on Monday.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.520
Well, she is a doctor, isn't she?

58:28.640 --> 58:30.200
She might be right.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.560
Think calmly.

58:32.200 --> 58:34.200
How can I think calmly, Madame?

58:34.720 --> 58:36.680
How will I go through this night?

58:37.800 --> 58:39.800
How can I wait for Monday?

58:40.160 --> 58:44.040
Of course, she is fine. That's not her child,

58:44.200 --> 58:47.720
the child is not with her.

58:49.120 --> 58:50.760
(quiet crying)

58:51.920 --> 58:53.120
Come on girl, let's go.

58:53.400 --> 58:58.240
Meli, where are you going? Don't
do anything rash. Endaksi (Alright)?

58:58.240 --> 59:01.440
Don't worry Madame, I'm doing what's best for Deniz.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.640
(doorbell rings)

59:03.640 --> 59:05.840
Here he is, I'm dying to see this man.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.560
Go and open the door.

59:20.120 --> 59:21.280
(door slams)

59:33.520 --> 59:34.320
Damn him.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.400
Who, Jan?

59:35.600 --> 59:36.000
No.

59:36.240 --> 59:36.680
Who then?

59:37.200 --> 59:38.120
What the hell is going on?

59:38.120 --> 59:39.680
Go and see for yourself.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.680
God, how will I find him?

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:05.080
Deniz, won't you tell me what's going on? Who is this baby?

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:06.920
Meli's baby, who else?

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:08.160
Who the hell is Meli?

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:11.640
Suzan, how many times are you
going to ask the same question?

1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:15.320
The tranny you saw in my office.
How many times do I have to tell you?

1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:17.920
Look here, Deniz. Please come to your senses.

1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:19.200
You should better listen..

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:21.040
No. You listen, little fool.

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:25.320
Firstly, that is not your office, it's mine.

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:29.320
Secondly, this isn't your home either, it is mine, too.

1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:30.080
Really?

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:31.360
Thirdly

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:34.600
and lastly, I don't have to put up with you,

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:38.680
you'll be raping my rights because
of your weird relations with perverts.

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:41.440
Now you hear me out.

1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:44.920
First. neither this office, nor
this apartment belong to you.

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:48.360
They're owned by father, whom you call uncle.

1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:51.480
Second, we are both his puppets.

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:56.120
Third, you are more of a fool, more
naive and even more ignorant then I am.

1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:00.160
I don't have to rape your rights
because your rights are already like a whore.

1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:02.480
Raped by the closest people to you.

1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:06.000
You've had no rights since the day you were born.

1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:07.720
Just like me.

1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:09.720
Just like this baby.

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.160
Just like Meli.

1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:13.360
The tranny, remember?

1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:15.880
Deniz. Do you hear what you are saying?

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:19.080
- Listen..
Deniz: Now we are burdened with this baby,

1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:22.200
forget it. What the hell are we going to do?

1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:25.480
(footsteps)

1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:26.960
(cat screeches)

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.080
(police sirens)

1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:44.760
(cat screeches)

1:01:57.760 --> 1:01:59.600
Excuse me, can we talk for a while?

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.800
I am late for work, if you want to
meet me, come to Madame Margot.

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:06.120
No, no, I want to talk about something else.

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:09.280
You found a baby in the street.

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:12.840
Don't worry, I am not with the police,
I am just a friend of his mother's.

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:14.200
I found no baby.

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:17.160
Look, don't make it difficult.

1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:19.160
I don't want to go to the police.

1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:24.080
I've been following you for a while. I know
your house, the night club, and everything.

1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:25.240
Are you the father?

1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:27.640
No, just a good friend of the mother's.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:30.520
Please help us out, the child's life is at sake.

1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:35.440
His bitch of a mother should've thought of
that before she threw him out onto the street.

1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:37.920
She had a nervous breakdown.

1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:43.480
Look, she's a prostitute

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:45.560
You live in the same world as her.

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:49.200
You know what kind of a bad time a girl can have.

1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:52.920
Yes I do know, but I don't have the kid any more.

1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:54.240
Where is he then?

1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.400
I was forced to throw him to the street,
too. I couldn't look after him.

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:00.440
Where did you throw him?

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:01.640
I left him in a park.

1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:02.560
Which park?

1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:06.120
The weather was nice, I left
him in a park early in the morning.

1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:08.520
Someone must have found him within an hour.

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:10.040
Okay, but which park?

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:13.440
Machka park. I put him on a bench close to the street,

1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:16.920
so that someone would be able
to hear him when he cried.

1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:20.480
When did you leave him?

1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:21.920
Three, four days ago.

1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:23.880
Of course, it was Saturday.

1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:28.120
If you don't believe me, let's go
back to my place and you can have a look.

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:31.440
Aylin: He's lying.

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:32.840
The stupid faggot.

1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:35.920
No.. He's telling the truth.

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:40.520
I've been watching the house for two
days, now. I haven't seen any baby.

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:45.960
He lives with a gay boy and an old woman.

1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:49.640
The other night, the boy and
the woman went out somewhere,

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:53.480
before they returned, the tranny left for the nightclub.

1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:56.800
So? What's that supposed to mean?

1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:01.000
That means there was no one at home.

1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:03.960
They wouldn't leave a baby alone at home, would they?

1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:06.200
They could have left him with a neighbor.

1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:10.320
Why should they? They would
have taken him with them.

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:14.400
It was bound to happen, I guess.

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:19.120
Even I couldn't look after him,
how could a man handle it?

1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:24.520
He looked after my child more than I did.

1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:29.320
He thought better than you, too.

1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:33.000
He says, someone must have taken him within an hour.

1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:42.480
(sobs)

1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:44.520
Okay, don't cry, we will find him.

1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:48.000
How? God knows who took him this time?

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:51.040
Who? Who would have taken him?

1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:54.320
Nobody is as crazy as that damn tranny.

1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:03.680
Of course..

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:08.200
What would anybody do, if they found a baby in the park?

1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:13.400
They would take him to the police, let's go.

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:15.160
Excuse me, Officer,

1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:17.720
was there a baby found in Machka Park last Saturday?

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:23.360
What was the date?

1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:24.480
Ummm..

1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.240
Today is the eighth..

1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:28.600
Third.
Ali: Yes so it must be the third.

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:35.840
(silently praying)

1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:40.600
Yeah.

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:42.440
A six month old baby boy.

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.760
(cello music)

1:05:57.320 --> 1:05:58.440
Good morning.

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.000
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.600
I'm not sleepy.

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:07.960
Poor darling.. He has been playing all night.

1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:10.320
(cello music ends)

1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:13.560
You miss him, don't you?

1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:18.680
I miss him a lot, too.

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:19.680
(cello music)

1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:21.800
The house isn't the same.

1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:25.040
The time has stopped without him.

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:29.440
It's not only that, we're about to get into trouble.

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:32.600
What's up?

1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:34.720
Yesterday, I was going to the club.

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:37.640
A friend of Deniz's mother stopped me.

1:06:37.960 --> 1:06:39.640
They're looking for the baby.

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.360
You should've given them the Doctor's address.

1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:46.600
We have done her wrong.

1:06:46.600 --> 1:06:48.400
Don't be ridiculous.

1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:51.240
Even we couldn't deal with his illness.

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:54.000
How can his whore of a mother deal with it?
(cello music ends)

1:06:57.760 --> 1:06:59.240
Deniz is in safe hands.

1:06:59.240 --> 1:07:01.600
(baby crying)

1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:06.160
Oh my God, it stinks in here.

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:08.120
(laughter)

1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:10.240
Stop laughing and hold his feet.

1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:14.960
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea feeding him what we eat.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.040
That would explain the stench.

1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:17.680
(baby cries and screams)

1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:21.080
What would I know? I did
everything like the book said.

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.160
(baby screams and cries)

1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:25.160
(chuckles)

1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:28.320
Sh, shh, shhh

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:30.160
I'm dead.

1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:33.960
Let me put him in the bed, I'll be back.

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:44.320
(crying stops)

1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:55.800
Oh God, it's so exhausting looking after a baby.

1:07:56.840 --> 1:07:58.600
You deserve all this.

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:00.280
Why?

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:03.880
Do I deserve this because I help a
baby who was abandoned by his mother?

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:06.480
(phone vibrates)

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:11.960
Dr. Deniz.

1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:15.640
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:17.800
You're very kind.

1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:19.880
Good evening to you.

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:21.680
He's not deaf.

1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:24.000
The child isn't deaf.

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.280
Good for him.

1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:28.840
Aren't you pleased?

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:31.320
Deniz.

1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:34.320
You forget that our family has roots.

1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:36.600
You consort with cheap homosexuals,

1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:38.240
whores and their bastards.

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:39.240
Really?

1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:41.800
Only the likes of us have rights, is that it?

1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:44.120
Doesn't this little baby have any rights?

1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:46.800
Come on, don't try to confuse the issue,

1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:48.360
I didn't mean it that way.

1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:50.760
Everyone creates their own rights.

1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:53.800
How do you expect this little baby to create his own rights?

1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:55.720
He doesn't even have a birth certificate.

1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:59.760
He will wait all his life for Lady Suzan
and good families to give him a break?

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:02.920
Deniz, you're starting to get on my nerves again.

1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:07.160
You have become so insolent since you have
been in contact with these kind of people.

1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:09.080
What do you mean, these kind of people?

1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:12.600
Do you mean bastards?
We are also two of those people.

1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:14.360
Deniz, I forbid you.

1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:15.440
You can't do a damned thing.

1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:17.800
Stop this insolence at once, you fool.

1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:19.680
You are the biggest fool of us all.

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:22.000
Do you know who you are? What you are?

1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:24.560
You're a bastard too.

1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:25.680
That does it.

1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:27.800
I don't have to hear your filth anymore.

1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:29.280
But you must.

1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:30.880
I just learned the truth.

1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:32.400
Would you like to know the truth?

1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:35.760
You were curious why Dad came to Istanbul.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.760
Well, let me tell you..

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:44.720
When your Mother was 16, and my Father 15
(dramatic music)

1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:47.480
they fell in love with each other.

1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:53.440
They knew that our family with roots
wouldn't allow two cousins' marriage.

1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:55.200
So they kept it a secret.

1:09:55.600 --> 1:09:59.360
They thought, it was a phase,
and they'd get over it in time.

1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:01.200
But they didn't.

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.000
It got worse.

1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:04.840
Then, one day..

1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:07.360
Your Mom was pregnant.

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:09.600
Deniz, you're lying.

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.640
Nobody suspected Dad, of course.

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:13.200
Dad influenced your grandad,

1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:14.480
sticking up for his cousin.

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:16.440
They easily solved the problem on paper,

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:21.400
creating an imaginary groom and his sudden death,
which was announced to everyone concerned.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.200
Remember your Father who died in an accident?

1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:25.560
That's the one.

1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:29.360
Sit down.

1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:30.800
I'm not finished yet.

1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:33.640
You should hear my side of the story, too.

1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:35.200
(sighs)

1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:39.680
Then, Dad went to university in Istanbul.

1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:43.520
As your Mother longed for him back home,

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:46.840
one night his friends took him out for a good time.
(music intensifies)

1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:52.840
He spent the night with the most reputable
and beautiful woman of leisure in Pera.

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:56.720
And guess what? They fell in love.
(music fades out)

1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:58.080
Da da da da.

1:10:58.080 --> 1:10:58.920
(dramatic music starts)

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:02.040
Just like La Dame aux Camelias, isn't it?

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:05.200
Just before Father graduated and returned home,

1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:07.840
she got pregnant.

1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.360
And guess who was born?

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.800
Yours, truely.

1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:18.520
Early years I haven't seen Dad who's
supposed to have a business in Germany.

1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:22.880
Then supposedly, Mother joined
him and an old woman looked after me.

1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:27.840
As I grew older, Mother couldn't deal with my questions,
given that she only saw me once or twice a month.

1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:30.960
So she decided to write a letter to Dad.

1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:32.480
Poor Dad,

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:35.320
ran to me with pain and curiosity.

1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:37.680
When he saw how much I looked like him,

1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:39.760
he couldn't resist taking me.

1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:40.720
(sarcastically discards)

1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:42.840
It's the blood, see?

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:46.680
He immediately found my Mom,

1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:52.080
they again fixed the formalities and fooled
me with this story that she died in Germany.

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:54.680
Why did he tell you all this?

1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:56.160
You won't believe it.

1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:58.360
Guilty conscience, he said.

1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:00.760
He had to tell somebody.

1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:02.240
What a lie.

1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:03.960
You know what he asked of me?

1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:05.880
He asked of me to find my Mother.

1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:07.560
You see? It's not me.

1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:09.640
He thinks he's unfair to the woman.

1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:13.880
The woman who had me without his consent
and without thinking about my future.

1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:17.920
Sit down, I'm not finished yet.

1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.240
Now do you understand why we are bastards?

1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:29.000
And I?

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:30.880
What am I?

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:33.160
A bastard, and a daughter of a whore.

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:36.640
And that father of mine wishes to find the woman

1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:39.080
so that she can see me once more before she dies.

1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:41.640
So..

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.240
We had this conversation, and the next day,

1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:47.320
in the early hours of the
morning this baby was brought to me.

1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:50.400
Is he any different than I was,

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:52.360
when I was born?

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:55.840
Poor thing.. What does he know?

1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:59.560
So don't you ever talk to me about
tradition, class, roots or anything.

1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:02.640
There are so many supposedly
human beings, who were done wrong.

1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:04.240
We are the luckiest.

1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:07.160
This baby has less of a chance.

1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:10.200
Meli and Evgenia have no chance at all.

1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:12.880
So don't you dare belittle them.

1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:16.680
Damn you.

1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:18.400
(music ends)

1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:25.160
It's fucking Saturday night again.

1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:28.800
I hope Deniz's Mother doesn't stir things up.

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:32.400
Don't be silly, girl. It's been so long.

1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:39.920
That damn whore forgot she had
a son. She won't look for him anymore.

1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:42.040
Stupid woman.

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:44.880
I am more worried about that fucking Doctor.

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:48.320
I hope she hasn't given my son to an orphanage.

1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:10.280
Suzan please talk to me.

1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:13.440
It's been days.

1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:15.760
Why are you so angry with me?

1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:18.160
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:22.000
Why are you angry with me?

1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:24.400
Am I responsible for what Father did?

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:25.920
Answer me.

1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:31.240
Okay, don't talk to me.

1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.520
Father, you...That homo, Meli.

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:38.000
Father has satisfied his guilty conscience.

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:41.120
You are getting rid of your anger by blaming me.

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:44.960
Meli got out of his responsibility.

1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:46.680
(grunts in dispair)

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:48.200
That Meli...

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:53.320
The son of a bitch is enjoying himself in that
nightclub while I look after his bastard here.

1:14:59.360 --> 1:14:59.960
The nightclub...

1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:02.640
♪ I planted a Lemon Tree in the stone
(audience clapping in time with song)

1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:03.920
♪ Lemon, my love

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:06.960
♪ I planted a Lemon Tree in the stone

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:09.120
♪ Lemon, my love

1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:10.320
♪ It didn't grow

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:13.320
♪ We'll wait for the winter.

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:14.800
♪ It didn't grow

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:16.760
♪ We'll wait for the winter

1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:19.520
♪ Lover's white arms

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:21.560
♪ Lemon, my love

1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:23.880
♪ Lover's white arms

1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:25.880
♪ Lemon, my love

1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:29.840
♪ Were not long enough to embrace me

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:34.120
♪ Were not long enough to embrace me

1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:37.960
♪ I asked for Lemons and got Pomegrantes

1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:44.960
(music dies down, microphone screeches)
You low down creature. Take your bastard.

1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:47.000
He's not deaf either.

1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:53.800
If you think you'll get away with
this, you're very much mistaken.

1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:03.120
The show must go on.

1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:04.280
(music starts)

1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:11.600
I can't believe you've done this to me.

1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:16.120
(baby cries)
You made me the laughing stock of the club.

1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:19.000
You made me look the right schmuck.

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:21.880
I won't let you get away with this, Okay?

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:24.200
You cheated on me.

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:26.800
What's more, with a fucking woman.

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:28.600
And I'm so stupid.

1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:30.440
I thought you had a man.

1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:35.040
Meanwhile you were with a fucking woman,

1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:39.960
and you breed a little bastard, on top of it all.

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:43.760
You are just a low down breeder.

1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:44.960
You hear?

1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:46.120
Low down breeder.

1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:47.600
(baby giggles)

1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:51.240
(light switch on)

1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:02.440
(baby noises)

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:05.600
(emotional music)

1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:03.520
(music ends)

1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:06.960
What's wrong with you? Are you fucking kidding me?

1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:09.960
I can't believe it.

1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:12.520
How many times did you cheat on me?

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:14.080
Isn't it enough?

1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:18.480
Are you.. Are you serious?
What's wrong with you?

1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:23.200
(clanking of cutlery)

1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:29.160
Miss Meli, the Boss wants to see you.

1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:42.280
Good evening Boss.

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:46.400
Good evening Meli, come sit down.

1:18:55.640 --> 1:18:57.560
You know, I like you.

1:18:58.240 --> 1:18:59.360
Thank you Boss.

1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:02.400
I also like you,
and respect you.

1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:06.800
You proved to be the only decent man
in this house of fairies.

1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:07.920
Well done.

1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:09.840
Please let me explain, Boss.

1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:11.360
No, no need to.

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:13.240
Meli, son...

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:16.760
Whatever perversion you may have lived,

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.160
you found the right way at last.

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:21.480
You've become a man again.

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:22.800
Man again?

1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:25.200
And what a man.

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:27.360
A father.

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:30.840
Look, no one knows this..

1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:35.920
Go get my coat from the car.

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:43.520
I've divorced five women.

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:46.000
The present one is eighteen.

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:48.640
But, I'm still not a father.

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:51.400
At first, I blamed the women,

1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:54.880
but now I know, it's me.

1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:57.280
I can't be a father, Meli.

1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:00.120
It's a blessing to be a father.

1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:02.200
So I respect you.

1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:03.880
Thanks Boss.

1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:05.240
Call me Suleyman.

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:06.440
Thanks, Suleyman.

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:08.320
Take this dress off.

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:10.600
Go find that woman.

1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:11.800
Cherish her.

1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:13.400
Marry her.

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:16.200
Raise your child in a happy home.

1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:20.320
A father cannot live this perverted life.

1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:23.280
I think there has been a misu...
Suleyman: Look, Meli, son.

1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:27.280
What's with this Meli business anyway?
Don't you have a normal name?

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:29.520
Fikri, Suleyman..

1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:31.920
That's better, Fikri, son...

1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:32.840
Look...

1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:35.720
I don't want you to work as a...

1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:38.040
Like this.

1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:39.840
Do not ask me,

1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:43.280
or anybody else for this kind of job again.

1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:47.680
If I see you.. Or hear about it..

1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:51.360
Son, it's not good.

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000
I'll break your legs.

1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:55.760
Deniz

1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:58.760
Will you sit with me a while?

1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:07.120
I've thought a lot.

1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:09.840
First I blamed everybody.

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:12.560
You first, then Uncle.

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:15.040
and my Father, then my Mother

1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:18.560
Until there was no one else to blame.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:25.400
Finally, I realized you must
have suffered more than I did.

1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:30.920
I also realized you are much wiser than I.

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.520
You see things much clearer.

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.320
As I was leading my happy life...

1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:43.480
not knowing what was going on...

1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:46.600
You had an unhappy childhood
without a mother or a father...

1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:52.680
And I added to your unhappiness.

1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:57.160
Forgive me.

1:21:58.320 --> 1:21:59.840
(cries)

1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:03.800
You know what hurt most?

1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:11.840
Father chose to tell you all this, and not me.

1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:15.760
He could have at least talked to both of us.

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:17.680
(cries)

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:26.160
All my childhood, I wished that Uncle had been my Dad.

1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:28.680
But...

1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:31.720
Now I know,

1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:34.760
father doesn't really love me.

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.840
(cries)

1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:39.720
You are wrong.

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:42.640
Father loves you more than he loves me.

1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:46.840
He upset me, but didn't want to upset you.

1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:51.680
He didn't want me to tell you any of this.

1:22:52.040 --> 1:22:53.680
He asked me not to.

1:22:55.520 --> 1:22:57.160
But I...

1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:01.280
I was overcome with a moment's anger.

1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:07.520
(cries)

1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:18.760
I don't know.

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:22.200
I think it is a bit..

1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:26.880
You'll have to take off the nail varnish.

1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:38.640
I feel funny.

1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:45.040
Alright.

1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:48.120
But why?
Meli: Why what?

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:49.920
Why you become a man all of a sudden?

1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:52.440
I can't work the clubs anymore.

1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:55.040
Instead of working as a sex labourer on the highways,

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:58.280
in man clothes,
I can do any type of work.

1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:00.200
You're not telling the truth.

1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:01.480
Why?

1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:02.560
(clarinet music)

1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:04.080
Madame..

1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:06.840
I..

1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:13.480
I loved for the first time in my life..

1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:17.680
I'm even ready to die for Deniz.

1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:21.280
(baby cries)

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:22.960
(sobbing)

1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:24.920
Meli

1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:29.440
I wish I was once as brave as you are.

1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:31.360
(takes a deep breath)

1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:34.680
(music ends)

1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:36.160
I'll do the washing up.

1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:38.760
But there's a dishwasher,
my hands won't be ruined.

1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:41.600
Oh sister it's so...
Meli: Don't call me sister anymore.

1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:44.440
I wish I could find some work.

1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:45.840
Don't be silly.

1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:48.160
You have to look after Deniz for now.

1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:50.880
Let's find a mother for Deniz first.

1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:52.480
(rebetiko music)

1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:56.120
Mama, you won't believe this.
Meli decided to get married.

1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:57.280
Who's the groom?

1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.000
Not a groom Mama, a woman.

1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:02.880
(music stops)
Jesus Christ.

1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:08.920
Sister.

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:11.000
How can you marry a woman?

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:12.280
Have you gone mad?

1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:15.000
Just think, girl.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:16.640
All problems will be solved.

1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:19.960
I will make up a story that my wife died during birth...

1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:24.160
And say that's why I never had a chance
to get the child's birth certificate.

1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:27.680
Then, we can go to the registry office
and get the certificate

1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:30.040
as if he is our very own child.

1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:33.480
Madame, now this is your show.

1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:35.600
You know everybody in the neighbourhood.

1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:38.440
Ask around, find me a wife.
A widow, maybe.

1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:39.360
Are you sure?

1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:40.160
Yes.

1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:41.240
I don't know?

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:42.480
What do you mean?

1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.760
I feel sorry for the woman too, you know.

1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:53.520
My husband died of a heart attack.

1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:55.920
It's been two years.

1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:57.880
Well, destiny.

1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:00.240
Yeah, sure.

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.360
You know, many suitors came.

1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:06.320
But I didn't want them.

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.880
I understand, so you loved your husband.

1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:11.400
Yeah, sure.

1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:16.040
He was a lot older than me.

1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:20.320
How's yours?

1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:21.840
Pardon?

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:24.200
Your heart and everything,
are you healthy?

1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:26.160
Quite, thank God.

1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:27.520
Bless you.

1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:30.120
You are like a ram.

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:34.440
Thank you. Madam Naciye, are you
fond of children?

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:38.000
Yes, very much.

1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:40.560
But I couldn't have any.

1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:43.520
Obviously, my husbands age.

1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:49.440
You may have wondered what
I've done for two years, right?

1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:52.000
Please, your past is no concern of mine.

1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:57.440
I swear, not any man touched my hand for two years.

1:26:57.720 --> 1:26:59.440
What concerns me is Deniz.

1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:02.400
I want him to grow in a happy home, have a mother.

1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:03.920
Sure.

1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:07.400
As I said, I love children.

1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:14.520
May I have a Chicken Breast Pudding?

1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:15.800
I beg your pardon?

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.600
A Chicken Breast Pudding, you know?

1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:22.840
Talking about children,

1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:25.600
funny things came to my mind.

1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:27.120
What funny things?

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:28.280
You know..

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:30.200
What happens

1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:31.960
before having a child.

1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:35.160
If I have a pudding, I will forget about it.

1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:36.760
Waiter.

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.360
May I have a Chicken Breast Pudding?
Waiter: Yes Madam.

1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:41.080
Chicken Breast Pudding for the lady.

1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:42.960
With ice-cream.

1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:44.360
(repeats her silently)

1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:49.880
I think we should get to know each
other closely, before we get married.

1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:51.720
What do you mean?

1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:53.760
No way.

1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:55.760
Never before the wedding.

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.400
You misunderstand.

1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:00.520
You know, we should know what each other likes, etc.

1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:01.280
Oh...

1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:05.880
I like going to the cinema.

1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:08.560
Do you?
Meli: Sure, I like films too.

1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:10.000
There is a new film.

1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:12.400
With that handsome actor.

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:15.680
That huge muscly man.
Meli: Oh...

1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:18.040
I'm crazy about him, shall we go?

1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:28.120
Madame: How did you find her?
Meli: Hmm...

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:29.800
Well..

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:33.280
I don't know..Just a woman, I guess..

1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:36.840
Then we went to see a movie,
a good one.

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:38.600
The guy was huge.

1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:44.080
I was so involved with the guy, at one
point I thought I was holding his hand..

1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:47.000
and I was actually holding the woman's hand.

1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:48.400
(laughter)

1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:51.360
Well, when are you seeing her again?

1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:58.800
Hello, come in.

1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:02.320
Hello, I better not, we don't have much time.

1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:06.160
Come in, come in, I'll get ready right away.

1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:19.680
Thanks for the flowers. Let me take them.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.480
You're welcome.

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:23.760
Do sit down.

1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:25.120
Chocolate?

1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:26.920
No, thanks.

1:29:29.480 --> 1:29:31.040
You have a big apartment.

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:32.400
Yes, it is.

1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:35.520
Left to me by my late husband.

1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:39.720
But you should see the bedroom.

1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:41.920
Liqueur?

1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:43.840
Better not.

1:29:44.440 --> 1:29:45.920
We don't have a lot of time.

1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:50.160
What is time, for God's sake? We'll leave immediately.

1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:51.520
Enjoy.

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.640
Cheers.

1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:10.080
Between you and me, I love Liqueur.

1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:12.720
Take a chocolate.

1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:17.240
We'll be late for the movie.

1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:20.040
You should see the actor in this movie, he's so yummy.

1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:25.360
Never mind dear, the movies are always there, another?

1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:28.360
Enough for me, if you..

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:31.600
I must say, I will have another.

1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:33.760
Might as well.

1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:36.560
We've missed the next
performance. We'll never make it.

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.280
Never mind, dear.

1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:44.720
We will go to the performance after next.

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:46.520
So many of them, anyway.

1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:47.600
(giggles)

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.040
This Liqueur...

1:30:55.080 --> 1:30:56.200
(chuckles)

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:00.000
Makes me so..

1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:03.040
Makes me so gay.

1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:04.880
I see.

1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:09.760
Come on, I'll show you around

1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:13.880
No, need to..
Naciye: our apartment.

1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:17.920
And this is our bedroom.

1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:19.640
It's very big, isn't it?

1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:21.120
Yes, it is big.

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:25.440
It's big enough to take our love in it. Every night.

1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:27.840
Oh, I feel so warm.

1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:29.040
Naciye..

1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:30.520
Call me, "my Naciye".

1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:35.800
When you held my hand in the cinema,
you've woken desires within me.

1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:38.360
And since that night..

1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:43.600
This bed seems too big for me, when I'm alone.

1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:45.960
Naciye, maybe we shouldn't hurry.

1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:49.480
We should, we're already late.

1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:51.280
You said, we can't before the wedding.

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:53.560
(panting)
We can, we can, why not?

1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:57.760
This is a special moment,
we should save it for our wedding night.

1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:00.160
We can do it then as well.

1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:06.360
Every night and every day.

1:32:06.800 --> 1:32:10.680
(heavy breathing)

1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:21.360
You can't do this to me.

1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:23.000
You can't leave me like this.

1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:25.360
I'm so sorry, I'm very sorry..

1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:32.400
I told you it would be difficult.

1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:36.680
She treated me like a whore.

1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:41.640
Don't even think about it. There's
a lot of women for you. We'll find one.

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:53.520
The court cases and all those, it's just stupid.

1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.280
The tranny lied.

1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:00.040
No, he didn't

1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:02.640
He didn't have the baby.

1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:06.240
You must believe it.

1:33:08.360 --> 1:33:10.440
Well..

1:33:15.440 --> 1:33:18.960
I have some bad news for you.

1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:28.560
The landlord is kicking me out.

1:33:32.520 --> 1:33:36.280
I have to go back to my Mother's place.

1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:39.440
I'm sorry..

1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:42.280
(people talking)

1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:58.880
Your Raki is in the kitchen Mama,
please serve yourself. I'll feed him

1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:11.800
(baby gurgles)

1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:14.040
(applause from outside)

1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:25.800
(sad music)

1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:11.720
(laughter and chatting)

1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:15.400
(crying)

1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:24.240
The court will not give the child to the mother.

1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:28.240
Why not, I thought we won the case?

1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:32.960
(sighs)
That's right we did,

1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:35.120
we proved you are the mother.

1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:42.240
But in cases like this, the court may not give the child
to the mother, because of the mother's social status.

1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:44.280
Because of my social status?

1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:48.520
Does that mean that.. Because I'm a whore?

1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:51.480
Do they think that I'm doing it for kicks?

1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:56.240
(sighs)
What now?

1:35:57.040 --> 1:35:58.840
The child will be given to a home.

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:00.840
You can see him twice a week.

1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:04.120
When you can take care of him, you can have him.

1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:06.080
(sarcastically approves)
Like shit I am.

1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:10.160
First, I gotta find a home, and
then I need to earn money.

1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:13.120
Who would give me any money if I don't fuck them?

1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:16.800
Tell her, I said that, our love
will fill that big bedroom of hers.

1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:21.160
Tell her that I couldn't do anything
because I was too much in love with her.

1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:22.160
And tell her that..

1:36:22.160 --> 1:36:23.680
Okay, okay.

1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:28.200
I know what a woman wants to hear.
I am a woman, too, you know.

1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:38.400
(cello music)

1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:49.760
(sobs)

1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:01.600
Don't be sad.

1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:05.040
We have to get used to this.

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:08.600
There is no happiness in love for us.

1:37:08.680 --> 1:37:09.520
(sobs)

1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:11.160
We shouldn't fall in love.

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:19.080
Maybe this is the worst thing of being a homosexual.

1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:21.720
(cries)

1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:24.800
How will I live in this apartment?

1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:30.000
Listen, I have an idea.

1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:34.440
Because of that bitch, we couldn't
even take Deniz to the park for days.

1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:38.360
Let's go on a vacation. We all go
to the seaside somewhere.

1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:42.640
We will take Naciye with us. Clean air will do us all good.

1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:48.320
What would I have done without you?

1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:50.000
(bursts into tears)

1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:52.440
(door knocks)

1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:55.480
Good evening, can you please give this to Dr. Deniz?

1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:57.440
You can say it's from, Jan, surgery.

1:37:57.640 --> 1:37:59.560
For sure, Doctor. She will be here any moment now.

1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:00.960
Thank you.

1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:08.480
I got straight to the point. I said
our Fikri is burning with your love, I said.

1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:13.240
Did you tell her that, I couldn't do anything that
day, because I was too much in love with her?

1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:17.040
I did, I told her the whole spiel.

1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:21.720
She laughed and she said:
Madame I'm in love myself.

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:23.680
I'm flying in the sky.

1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:26.440
I've got my plumber.

1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:28.280
Who the hell is the plumber?

1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:32.200
I was about to ask her that, this young man walked in.

1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:36.160
What a man, Hercules himself, barely in his 20's

1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:38.840
He had his pants on, naked on top.

1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:44.240
Even my heart went tip tap at my age, when I saw him.

1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:48.880
Madame never mind the
plumber's wrench, who the hell is he?

1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:52.360
The woman had a tap leaking, she called a plumber.

1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:57.800
This boy turned up, and they didn't
go out of the bed for three days.

1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:00.400
I bet, the tap is still leaking.

1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:02.720
I can't believe there are women like this.

1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:09.160
The boy came, sat next to Naciye and said:
Where have you been, my little dove?

1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:13.120
You should have seen the silly woman, she went all gaga.

1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:18.400
I was just afraid that she was going to take
his pants off and have him right there in front of me.

1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:21.480
She would, she almost got my pants off.

1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:22.080
Well?

1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.960
Well, you will have to forget Naciye.

1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:26.640
The plumber is happy.

1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:29.520
Oh my God, what am I going to do?

1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:33.640
Forget her, you can't handle
that oversexed woman anyway.

1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:36.440
You said there will be many woman who will marry me.

1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:37.200
Where are they?

1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:39.120
Why do you think I was so late?

1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:45.360
I went door to door, telling people to keep their
eyes open for a woman who wants to get married.

1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:50.160
Don't worry, in a couple of days,
they will come up with a candidate.

1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:51.320
(cello music)

1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:01.960
(door opens)

1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:04.560
Wake up, sister, wake up, wake up.

1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:05.240
What's up?

1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:06.920
Mama.. She's very ill.

1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:10.880
(door knocks)

1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:16.280
The last hour goes by so slowly on night duty.

1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:18.320
I can't believe we are almost finished.
(phone ringing)

1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:19.880
Surgery

1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:22.520
May I speak to Dr. Jan, please?

1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:26.840
He's in the operating theatre right
now, would you like to leave a message?

1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:29.520
No, I'll call him later.

1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:36.200
I.. I totally forgot to tell you, Dr. Jan
from surgery came and left you a note.

1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:38.840
I forgot to tell you.

1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:41.160
Where did I put it?

1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:44.920
I'm so sorry doctor, but it has almost been twelve hours.

1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:48.880
Underdone steak, Blood and juice on it.

1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:50.320
(laughter)

1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:53.560
A bit of salt, a bit of black pepper.

1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:54.760
Excuse me.

1:40:57.160 --> 1:40:58.920
Ok, butchers we're done.

1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:00.960
Make sure the stitches are aesthetic

1:41:01.880 --> 1:41:05.000
Remember that our patient is an attractive young lady.

1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:18.880
Doctor, they just brought in a patient, an elderly lady.

1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:21.800
Aorta is blocked and she has an hour at the most.

1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:25.280
If we wait for the day shift, she's not gonna make it.

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:26.400
Prepare her.

1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:28.520
I remember now.

1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:32.200
That's the one, I'm so sorry
again, doctor. Have a good day.

1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:38.160
"SHALL WE START AGAİN.. IF YOU WANT TO WORK ON IT,
FIND ME AT ONCE. I'LL BE INTHE OPERATING THEATRE
TILL MORNING. JAN"

1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:41.000
Evgenia: Mama please don't die.
(crying)

1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:42.600
I love you.

1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:46.160
Evgenia, kardiyamu (my heart).

1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.080
Don't be upset

1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:49.920
You've got Meli.

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:53.480
He's everything to you now.

1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.640
If I die, don't be upset.

1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:02.480
I've had a good life, and I am content.

1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:06.400
The only last wish I have is..

1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:07.760
What, Mama?

1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:09.360
Nurse: We need to take her to the theatre.

1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:10.360
Right now?

1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:12.360
(crying)

1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:15.160
This operation is a heart operation.

1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:18.640
More blood, I warn you.

1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:20.160
(coughs)

1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:31.840
Yeah, that sounds great.

1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:33.160
I'm going to call you back.

1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:34.320
I'm sorry, Doctor.

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:36.520
It's okay, did anyone call me?

1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:37.880
One moment, please.

1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:41.560
Ah yes, a lady called, she didn't leave
her name though, she said she'll call again.

1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:42.480
Thank you.

1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:44.080
Doctor..

1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:47.560
The lady they just took in is my mama.

1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:49.040
Please save her.

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:51.440
We will do our best. Please trust me.

1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.480
(crying)

1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:02.480
Oh, I feel so good.

1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:05.440
The room is full of pink clouds.

1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:06.080
(laughter)

1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:10.200
My Deniz, three years old, sitting on them.

1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:12.760
You can't come in here.

1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:14.640
I'm a doctor. He is expecting me.

1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:16.680
Please wait here, Doctor.

1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:18.280
Lord Jesus

1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:20.080
I know I am a sinner.

1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:23.600
You have every right to send me to hell.

1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:29.200
But I beg you. Please show me my
daughter for the last time.

1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:33.800
(dramatic music)

1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:36.280
Doctor is expecting you.

1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:39.600
Pleaae wait for a little, Doctor.

1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:42.120
I'm praying to Lord Jesus.

1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:43.720
What do you want from the Lord?

1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:48.080
I want him to show me my daughter, for the last time.

1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:49.680
Pray to Mohammed as well.

1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:51.800
They are the prophets of the same God.

1:43:52.320 --> 1:43:53.640
You are right..

1:43:54.880 --> 1:44:00.080
Lord Mohammed.. I lived all my life with Muslims.

1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:02.320
This is your country.

1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:06.480
I know what I have done is a sin in your religion, too.

1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:08.440
But I repent.

1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:12.040
Please, have a word with Lord Jesus.

1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:13.040
That's it.
(dramatic music)

1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:19.000
Now allow us to put this mask on your face,
I promise you'll see your daughter.

1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:22.160
She's here.

1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:27.560
Lord Jesus, Lord Mohammed.. Thank you.

1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:30.840
My girl..

1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:35.640
Take.. Take off your mask, please.

1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.280
(takes a deep breath)

1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:47.920
You have grown so much.

1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:51.240
But you're still so beautiful.

1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:56.560
Come closer, please.

1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:09.880
No pulse.
(solid tone on heart monitor)

1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:12.240
150 Joules, now

1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:31.040
(sad music)

1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:42.240
Don't think about it. It was
the influence of the sedation

1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:47.720
But, she looked at me so beautifully.

1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:50.800
She won't be looking at anything else anymore.

1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:54.680
She's lucky that the last thing she looked
at, was a beautiful girl like you.

1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:57.120
The last thing she touched was your hand.

1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:01.680
(electric doors open)

1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:09.760
I'm really sorry, but we lost your mother.

1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:12.040
(crying)

1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:18.600
Doctor, I'm finished. I can't live without her.

1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:25.000
My condolences, Evgenia. Please don't
upset yourself, she died very happy.

1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:30.720
Sister, what are we going to do without her?

1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:36.000
(crying)

1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:39.200
So you're a man now?

1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:41.000
But it's not going to save you.

1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:42.280
Where's the baby?

1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:45.280
We left him with the neighbor.

1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:49.000
Okay, I have done you wrong. I'm sorry,

1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:55.000
but did I do it out of spite? You told me
to call you if I needed any help with him.

1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:01.320
Alright, this is neither the place, nor the
time. You will give the baby to the authorities.

1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:05.440
(cries)

1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:09.840
(seagulls squawking)

1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:13.080
(cruiser steam horn)

1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:19.440
Evgenia: It has been so long, but I still think
I forgot mama's Raki everytime we go home.

1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.920
We will get used to it, sweetheart.

1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:35.360
Heart breaker

1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:41.480
Don't tell me..

1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:44.040
It's not what you think darling.

1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:46.760
You.. How could you do this to me?

1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:47.840
(laughter)

1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:52.040
The woman looked as if she just fell off a donkey.

1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:53.480
(chuckles)

1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:56.640
The fiddler will have some explaining to do now.

1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:03.800
It's so nice to see you laugh again.

1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:06.160
I missed your laugh.

1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:10.800
I am left all alone in this big apartment.

1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:12.320
Why should you be alone?

1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:15.800
I'm here, Deniz is here.

1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:17.520
At least for the time being.

1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:20.640
What do you mean, for the time being?

1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:25.760
Don't worry, mama couldn't find you
a woman, but I will get you married.

1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:30.320
It's too late now.. I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.520
You remember, we said we will fight for Deniz?

1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:35.440
Yes.

1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:37.240
We lost the fight.

1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:42.120
It's impossible to set a good life for Deniz, now.

1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:45.520
It's just you and me from now on.

1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.240
We have to look after each other.

1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:49.240
(emotional music)

1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:51.800
But, we should be thankful.

1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:55.360
Loneliness is our destiny.

1:48:56.240 --> 1:48:59.200
To be gay is a lonesome journey.

1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:02.720
I just hope Deniz won't be like us

1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:07.960
or all those glue sniffing kids on the streets.

1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:12.760
Don't we ask a lot from God?

1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:25.600
(music ends)

1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:58.520
Let me hug you for the last time, Son.

1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:04.560
Deniz

1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:10.000
My darling baby. I wish you could have understood me.

1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:13.360
I can't tell how difficult it is to part with you.

1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:19.920
I hope you will have a happy home and a
family who loves you as much as we did.

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:23.720
You will forget me.

1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:31.800
You will never know, someone wanted to be a
mother and father to you, and never succeeded.

1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:34.200
(baby cries)

1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.800
But I won't be able to forget you, all my life.

1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:40.880
And I'll always be your Papa.

1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:43.680
He doesn't want to go.

1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:47.640
He wants to stay with you, he doesn't want to go.

1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:57.520
(dramatic music starts)

1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:00.840
Look girl, it's that woman again.

1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:02.240
What woman?

1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:03.720
(baby cries)

1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.400
Why do you keep following me, woman?

1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:13.920
You're his mother, aren't you?

1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:18.520
You wanted to kill him. You wished him dead.

1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:21.560
That's why you threw him
where nobody could have found him.

1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:27.960
I could'nt have looked after him. When I
was sure he was dead, I was going to kill myself.

1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:31.280
When you saved him, I was scared.

1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:34.600
I didn't want to die, leaving him on this cruel world.

1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:38.360
I wanted to take him back from
you, that's why I followed you.

1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:39.600
(sobs)

1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:42.840
But I still don't have anything to give him.

1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:46.320
I don't even have a home.

1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:49.320
(crying)

1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:55.280
But I'm not as hopeless as I was when I first had him.

1:51:55.920 --> 1:52:00.480
You gave me hope, you gave me confidence.

1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:08.120
What do you say, Evgenia?

1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:12.040
Shall we take Deniz's Mother
in our apartment to live with us?

1:52:12.280 --> 1:52:13.680
Madame's room is empty now.

1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:17.440
Yes, please, Sister. I mean Fikri.

1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:19.600
You can call me Sister again.

1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:22.320
Ok, we're all going home.

1:52:22.640 --> 1:52:24.840
Give the boy to his Mom.

1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:25.840
(baby stops crying)

1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:51.840
(baby crying)

1:52:55.920 --> 1:52:57.800
(theme music)
