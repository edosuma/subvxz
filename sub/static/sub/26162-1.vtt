01:52.487 --> 01:53.318
Yes?

01:54.615 --> 01:55.446
Hello.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.064
- I'm going down.
- Me too.

02:03.957 --> 02:08.827
CUSTODY

02:42.788 --> 02:44.574
I'll read Julien's statement.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.536
This hearing was postponed to take it.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.076
A word about his statement.

02:50.253 --> 02:54.247
When we send children
to family mediation services

02:54.424 --> 02:57.212
- I'll explain if you don't know -

02:57.386 --> 03:02.426
we tell them that what they say
will be shared with their parents.

03:02.766 --> 03:06.634
If they don't want something shared,
they mustn't say it.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.894
It's a matter of due process.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.806
Everyone must be fully informed.

03:12.275 --> 03:17.611
'Julien is '11. He's in 6th grade
at Monod Junior High in Saint-Dumont.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.021
He said:

03:19.199 --> 03:22.942
"My parents separated a year ago.
I live with Mom and my sister.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.203
"There's a party
for my sister's 18th birthday.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.956
"We live with Papy and Nana
except my father.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.664
"Mom doesn't help with homework.
I'm a good student.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.172
"I have lots of friends
and get by fine."

03:38.927 --> 03:40.463
Where was I?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.010
"...lots of friends and get by fine.

03:45.183 --> 03:49.347
"I can't play outside.
We're scared that man will come.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.346
"Papy screams. It's not good for him.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.767
"When he comes, I worry about Mom.
All he wants

03:55.944 --> 03:57.275
"is to harass her."

03:57.446 --> 03:59.357
Listen to what I'm saying.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.698
You can speak to your lawyer later.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.029
"I worry about Mom.
He wants to hurt her.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.948
"He's no father.
I'm glad they're divorcing.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.744
"I can't leave my mom and sister alone."
Bad reason.

04:15.464 --> 04:19.332
"Josephine dislikes him
but she's old enough to not see him.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.341
"I won't see him either

04:21.511 --> 04:24.469
"or be forced to
every other week

04:24.639 --> 04:25.549
"or weekend.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.965
"I won't see him again.
That's all."

04:28.143 --> 04:29.884
Counselor, you may speak.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.434
So...

04:31.938 --> 04:34.305
Mrs. Besson receives...

04:34.483 --> 04:37.851
an unemployment check
of 981 euros a month.

04:38.028 --> 04:43.273
She's married to Antoine Besson,
who's in charge of fire safety

04:43.450 --> 04:45.236
at Lecorney hospital.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.528
He makes 2,200 euros a month.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.536
They have two children.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.826
Josephine will be 18,
so custody doesn't concern her.

04:55.003 --> 04:58.792
But we have to establish
a new life for Julien.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.252
It's why we took his statement.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.711
We don't agree
with the other side's request.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.846
Mr. Besson wants joint custody
once he moves to the area,

05:11.019 --> 05:13.556
now that he was transferred here.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.347
But as we can clearly observe,

05:16.525 --> 05:19.768
the children don't want
to see their father again.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.727
It's true that...

05:22.322 --> 05:25.690
Julien expresses this desire
a bit forcefully.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.859
He rejects his father.

05:28.203 --> 05:32.117
His statement indicates tension
between the spouses,

05:32.290 --> 05:34.827
but also extreme insecurity.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.412
His own.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.954
The case shows
why these children feel unsafe.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.294
I provided
Josephine's medical certificate,

05:43.468 --> 05:46.335
which shows the violence
she was subjected to

05:46.513 --> 05:47.628
by her father.

05:47.806 --> 05:52.721
So we ask that the children
reside permanently with their mother.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.054
Josephine is almost an adult.

05:56.231 --> 05:59.144
She can visit her father
as she wishes.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.309
But we also ask
the same thing for Julien.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.478
Until things calm down

06:04.656 --> 06:07.774
and until he wants
to see his father again.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.033
All this increases stress.

06:10.203 --> 06:14.037
My client withdrew her complaint
to be conciliatory.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.620
He threatened her
to make her withdraw it.

06:17.794 --> 06:21.879
He'd call, go to her parents' house,
sleep in his car.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.755
Do you have proof?

06:23.925 --> 06:27.168
Her parents testified that he came...

06:27.345 --> 06:29.427
I mean proof of threats.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.594
No witnesses of course.
No messages saved.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.805
She changed numbers repeatedly.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.471
So, to be conciliatory yet again,

06:38.690 --> 06:42.149
my client is not asking for alimony.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.979
However, she is living with her parents.

06:46.156 --> 06:50.650
She left everything she owned
personally and jointly

06:50.827 --> 06:52.363
in their former home.

06:52.537 --> 06:56.121
She must start from scratch.
She has no savings.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.328
Yes, she's at her parents',

06:58.501 --> 07:03.667
but she pays rent, helps out
and bears the cost of the children.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.799
She has immediate
and essential expenses

07:07.969 --> 07:09.710
to find a place to live.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.004
So she requests an advance

07:12.182 --> 07:15.174
of 5,000 euros
on her share of common property.

07:15.936 --> 07:20.806
We request that you obligate
her husband to pay this.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.558
Otherwise, we agree

07:24.736 --> 07:28.855
to child support
totaling 110 per month, per child.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.692
That's all I have on behalf of...

07:33.620 --> 07:36.829
both the children and their mother.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.828
Your turn, Counselor.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.162
Thank you, Your Honor.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.956
Julien said certain things
against his father,

07:47.175 --> 07:51.544
but much has been read
into his statement.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.804
I don't understand
the point of this hearing.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.012
Nothing here is black and white.

07:58.186 --> 08:02.271
Education is the responsibility
of both parents.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.433
I'm shocked by what I just heard.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.653
Mr. Besson was transferred
and requests joint custody

08:09.823 --> 08:12.815
only to be accused of harassment,

08:13.034 --> 08:16.277
of threats,
of violence against his daughter,

08:16.454 --> 08:19.617
with a note from a school nurse
as proof?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.116
I find it stupefying

08:22.293 --> 08:24.785
and extremely inappropriate.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.498
In my file,
you'll find several affidavits.

08:29.467 --> 08:33.335
My client's parents,
also victims of her whims,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.471
deprived of their grandkids
since the separation.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.508
His colleagues, who describe him

08:39.686 --> 08:44.226
as an excellent team leader,
well-balanced, calm, even-tempered.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.767
Affidavits from members
of his hunting club,

08:47.944 --> 08:54.532
describing him as generous, obliging,
a nature lover who doesn't drink.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.446
A normal man,

08:56.619 --> 08:59.611
who bears no resemblance

08:59.789 --> 09:03.532
to the violent, threatening boor
portrayed here.

09:04.335 --> 09:07.043
If Mrs. Besson has proof of threats,

09:07.213 --> 09:10.672
let her show them
and the police can investigate.

09:10.842 --> 09:14.335
But "harassment" and "threats"
don't describe

09:14.512 --> 09:17.595
a hurt father reaching out
to his kids.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.966
And I'm measuring my words.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.350
Mrs. Besson severed all ties
with my client overnight.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.222
And since then,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.893
she's refused to let him
talk to his children.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.438
Her parents' number is now unlisted.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.106
Yes, it's true.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.572
Mr. Besson did indeed sleep in his car

09:39.746 --> 09:43.159
in front of her parents' house.
It's true.

09:43.500 --> 09:49.086
Hoping to see his children,
not for the fun of sleeping in a car.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.502
I can assure you that Mr. Besson is...

09:52.675 --> 09:55.667
astounded to hear what Julien thinks.

09:55.845 --> 10:00.089
His son's words don't reflect
their time together.

10:00.266 --> 10:04.760
Given the context,
we can suspect they're someone else's.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.646
This is what Mr. Besson says now:

10:08.358 --> 10:09.894
"My daughter is an adult.

10:10.068 --> 10:13.652
"She'll make up her mind
about seeing me.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.859
"But I won't abandon my son.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.195
"I love him. He loves me.
And he needs me.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.076
"I'm leaving my job,
colleagues, friends.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.114
"I'm selling my house to be near my son,

10:25.291 --> 10:27.908
"to keep enjoying time together."

10:28.128 --> 10:33.544
Mrs. Besson can't take that away.
It's a child's basic right.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.709
She claims he wasn't a good husband

10:36.886 --> 10:40.004
but it doesn't mean he's a bad father.

10:40.265 --> 10:44.259
The law doesn't allow us
to break the father-son bond.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.348
So we still request the same thing.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.059
A standard visitation schedule.

10:50.233 --> 10:54.067
Every other weekend,
from noon Saturday to Sunday at 6 pm.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.195
And when my client lives in the area,

10:57.365 --> 10:59.902
joint physical custody:

11:00.076 --> 11:03.068
every other week and shared vacations.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.704
So we need her future address.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.454
Unless she leaves on a whim again.

11:09.627 --> 11:13.837
This is all to make
Julien's new life easier.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.841
Otherwise, we agree to their request
for child support.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.844
But we ask that you rule, Your Honor,

11:21.014 --> 11:23.802
on paragraph 7 of article 255:

11:24.392 --> 11:27.134
"A spouse may receive an advance

11:27.312 --> 11:31.397
on the liquidation of marriage property
if necessary."

11:31.566 --> 11:35.059
I'd like to know
if it's necessary or not.

11:35.570 --> 11:39.313
One spouse worked full-time
and is now unemployed,

11:39.490 --> 11:43.609
but it was her choice
to leave and come here.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.450
Each time my client asked
to see his children,

11:47.624 --> 11:50.412
he was told
they left for the weekend.

11:50.585 --> 11:54.169
She claims she's broke,
just 900 a month,

11:54.339 --> 11:58.253
yet takes weekend trips
and plans a big birthday party.

11:58.426 --> 12:02.294
The situation
doesn't justify this advance.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.840
- Did you provide a balance sheet?
- Yes, Your Honor.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.132
All right.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.618
Let's begin
with Josephine's medical certificate.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.620
What happened?

12:29.624 --> 12:31.581
She was in 9th grade.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.286
He kept an eye on her,
wouldn't let her date.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.751
He saw her kissing Samuel
at the Conservatory.

12:38.925 --> 12:42.384
She plays piano since she's 6.
Samuel is her boyfriend.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.547
That day she skipped school
to go see him.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.840
He caught them by surprise.

12:49.018 --> 12:53.683
He waited till she got home that night
and he hit her.

12:53.856 --> 12:58.441
I was at work and he called,
threatening to break her hands...

12:59.070 --> 13:01.903
if I didn't go straight home.
And so...

13:03.116 --> 13:05.073
she was in pain, and...

13:05.952 --> 13:07.863
The next day she saw the nurse

13:08.037 --> 13:10.995
to tell her about the problems at home.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.202
All right.

13:13.918 --> 13:14.749
Sir?

13:15.586 --> 13:18.874
She sprained her wrist at the gym.
What can I say?

13:19.048 --> 13:22.086
Which of you is the bigger liar?

13:25.513 --> 13:29.177
Look at the certificate, Your Honor.
3 years later.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.591
"L, Stephanie Bossel,

13:31.769 --> 13:36.104
"examined Josephine Besson
on October 12, 2013.

13:36.274 --> 13:40.518
"She had pain in the left wrist,
resulting in limited movement.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.687
"Pressure on the scaphoid
and 5th metacarpal

13:43.865 --> 13:47.358
"caused pain and a bruise
on the inside of the wrist.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.243
"She mentioned problems
with her father.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.496
"After discussion,
she decided not to use this note,

13:53.666 --> 13:56.704
"written at her request
and sent by mail."

13:56.878 --> 13:59.370
Mrs. Besson's former boss
also testified

13:59.547 --> 14:02.790
that he often spied on her
at her workplace.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.796
- Unbelievable!
- Please.

14:13.478 --> 14:17.187
Your children have turned against you.
Can you explain?

14:17.982 --> 14:19.143
No.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.024
I'd like to understand.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.564
I don't know what they're told.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.344
We can see
Julien is not ready to see his father.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.050
It's too stressful.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.716
- You make things worse.
- Stop, Counselor.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.602
You're the only person
losing your temper.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.185
Mr. Besson bought Julien a phone

15:04.862 --> 15:07.695
and yet he still has no contact.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.105
Julien won't answer.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.696
He tells Julien to put me on.
Julien stopped answering.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.279
We just want peace.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.324
I just want news of my kids.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.877
Who just wants peace?

15:23.047 --> 15:23.878
Excuse me?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.247
"We just want peace."
Who's "we"?

15:28.386 --> 15:29.547
Julien...

15:30.054 --> 15:33.263
me, my daughter too.
Ask her, you'll see.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.844
"Ask your daughter".

15:35.017 --> 15:38.885
Your children seem to be on your side.
That's unfortunate.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.018
Julien asked to give a statement

15:43.192 --> 15:45.729
when he learned
his father was moving here.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.565
I just want everything to go well.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.605
I think of my kids' well-being.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.486
May <i>I</i> Speak?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.078
Sir?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.914
I think of his well-being too.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.795
He needs supervision.
Taking away his father won't help.

16:17.685 --> 16:21.223
Your lawyers will receive my decision
on May 29th.

16:21.856 --> 16:22.971
Goodbye.

16:30.865 --> 16:31.946
Thank you.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.369
Hearings like this are always grueling.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.204
I'll call you once I have her decision.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.621
I'm confident.
She understands how the children feel...

16:52.553 --> 16:53.543
Antoine!

16:53.721 --> 16:55.337
- So?
- What a jerk.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.552
I'll be contacting you.
Goodbye.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.799
It went well.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.183
Miriam!

17:03.898 --> 17:05.059
For the kids.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.309
It's up to the judge now.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.194
- When will we know?
- A week.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.586
- Go on. She'll kill you.
- I don't care.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.151
- I'm <i>at</i> the Conservatory.
- I'm coming, Morn.

17:52.321 --> 17:56.110
We got out early so I saw Samuel off.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.822
<i>Stop lying.
Your teacher said you never came.</i>

18:00.496 --> 18:04.330
<i>Fifth time in 2 months.
Each time Samuel comes.</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:06.707
<i>Why do I pay for your classes?</i>

18:06.877 --> 18:10.211
- I've had enough.
- / don't <i>trust</i> you anymore.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.169
<i>We'll have a serious discussion,
believe me.</i>

18:35.698 --> 18:37.484
It's over here.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.786
Come in...

18:45.625 --> 18:47.866
So, there are three bedrooms.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.581
About 840 square feet.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.748
This is the foyer.
A separate toilet there.

18:55.426 --> 18:59.169
In the foyer, the intercom,
an electricity meter.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.963
Separate toilet.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.008
Wardrobe, closet... and the living room.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.801
This is my room.
I'll have a double bed.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.426
You sleep together?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.384
What the hell do you care?

19:49.522 --> 19:50.603
Is it him?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.306
SQ?

19:53.776 --> 19:55.767
- This is my room.
- Dream on!

19:55.945 --> 19:58.607
Samuel can't come over,
so why a big bed?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.109
Just like that man.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.028
Don't start up.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.783
Auntie?

20:05.079 --> 20:08.071
- Who's he?
- Cyril, a colleague at City Hall.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.291
He found this apartment for you.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.209
- What is it?
- I won't make it.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.000
You'll see him soon.
At your birthday.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.386
- She's so unfair.
- You need to concentrate.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.763
I promised I'd stop skipping class.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.223
Come on.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.933
I don't see myself here.

20:29.103 --> 20:32.937
Come on, you'll fix up your room.
It'll be fine.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.017
Come.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.148
You can go have a look.

20:37.153 --> 20:40.316
You're only 1O minutes from downtown.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.072
There's a bus station below...

20:43.242 --> 20:44.232
Excuse me.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.072
- It's available?
- First of the month.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.281
Hello, Counselor.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.287
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.081
Yes, Counselor?

21:04.388 --> 21:05.628
Really?

21:07.558 --> 21:08.889
Why?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.121
<i>Miriam?</i>

21:38.255 --> 21:41.964
- What's <i>going</i> on?
- He doesn't feel well. He can't come.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.542
<i>Come out to talk.</i>

21:44.720 --> 21:47.838
- <i>He has</i> a <i>stomach ache.</i>
- I'll <i>take him to the doctor.</i>

21:48.015 --> 21:50.552
- But...
<i>- Come give me the address.</i>

21:51.519 --> 21:53.055
I don't want trouble.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.687
<i>No trouble.
The judge ruled, period.</i>

21:57.608 --> 21:59.565
Antoine, he's really sick.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.601
<i>Come out and we'll talk.</i>

22:03.489 --> 22:05.105
No, I won't come out.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.989
<i>I have him this weekend.
If he doesn't come...</i>

22:10.663 --> 22:12.028
I'll <i>file</i> a <i>complaint.</i>

22:13.290 --> 22:14.906
<i>Am I being clear?</i>

22:21.090 --> 22:22.672
What did he say?

22:46.574 --> 22:48.110
<i>Bye-bye, JUN-.</i>

23:21.442 --> 23:22.807
Hello, sweetie.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.520
Hello.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.755
So I hear you're sick?

23:54.308 --> 23:56.390
Your mom said you were sick.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.348
Do you have any medicine?

24:07.404 --> 24:08.894
Talk to me.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.388
Put on your seatbelt.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.188
- You're a growing boy!
- You barely ate.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.152
We're going hunting early.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.993
No, next time.
He's not feeling well.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.780
Then there's no use insisting.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.332
Bring us our coffee.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.293
Blandine asked about her wedding again.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.295
- When is it?
- Next Saturday.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.708
I don't have Juju.
I can't drive another 600 miles.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.671
Answer her.
So she can plan.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.972
We can switch weekends.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.469
You see?

25:20.269 --> 25:22.306
She'd love to see you two.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.103
I made a surprise for you.

25:27.568 --> 25:28.399
Dad?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.602
Let's switch weekends.

25:33.657 --> 25:37.366
I'd like to go to Josephine's party
the weekend after.

25:41.582 --> 25:42.868
You want to?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.439
We have an hour.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.646
Because I picked you up an hour late.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.177
Who calls me "that man"?

28:17.154 --> 28:18.394
Me.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.657
Does your mother say it too?

28:26.914 --> 28:28.370
No, just me.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.787
And your sister?

28:45.432 --> 28:47.389
Want to go to her party?

28:56.109 --> 28:59.227
Why is your mother using you to ask me?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.024
She can't ask me?

29:02.532 --> 29:06.150
With a normal mom,
we can discuss things, don't you think?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.447
She should ask.
Why doesn't she?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.327
She has no cell phone.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.681
Give me your notebook.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.228
Give it to me.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.107
Her number doesn't work.

29:40.237 --> 29:42.069
Give me your notebook.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.698
Julien, your notebook.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.818
- <i>Hello?
-</i> It's <i>that man.</i>

30:28.660 --> 30:31.493
<i>- Is Julien with you?
- Yeah, he's here.</i>

30:32.289 --> 30:35.782
He asked to switch weekends
so he can go to the party

30:35.959 --> 30:37.495
in two weeks.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.377
<i>- Where did you get my number?
- Answer me.</i>

30:41.757 --> 30:43.964
<i>It would be nice if he could go.</i>

30:44.134 --> 30:47.468
Don't you think
you should ask me yourself?

30:47.637 --> 30:50.299
- Listen...
- It's not that hard.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.891
<i>Can we switch weekends
so he can go?</i>

30:54.269 --> 30:55.259
Please.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.556
<i>Please.</i>

30:59.691 --> 31:01.398
I'm on my way. We'll discuss it.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.242
Hey, Juju. How are you?

32:04.673 --> 32:07.085
- He won't switch weekends.
- He said so?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.170
- Because of his job.
- Fuck!

32:09.344 --> 32:10.175
Asshole!

32:10.303 --> 32:11.418
Why is he still there?

32:11.596 --> 32:13.883
- Relax!
- Must I go outside?

32:14.057 --> 32:17.015
I forgot my bag. I'll go get it.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.322
She's not home.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.580
<i>You've reached 061487...</i>

32:53.472 --> 32:55.554
Didn't I say she's not normal?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.342
- She's not home.
- Where is she?

33:00.312 --> 33:02.223
Can I get my bag?
I forgot it.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.524
You won't go to the party thanks to her.

33:07.986 --> 33:08.896
You'll be with me.

33:39.309 --> 33:41.721
<i>Tell me once you've done it.</i>

33:44.981 --> 33:47.097
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

34:24.145 --> 34:25.806
<i>Erase contact "Mom"?</i>

37:14.858 --> 37:16.644
Hey sweetie, how are you?

37:20.113 --> 37:22.150
Can you get your mother, please?

37:23.324 --> 37:24.155
Julien?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.837
I'll let you go to the party tonight.

37:39.716 --> 37:43.209
She needs to tell me
when to drop you off.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.048
She's not home.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.513
Yes, she is.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.637
She's not home!

38:03.406 --> 38:05.113
Then where is she?

38:11.748 --> 38:13.034
Where is she?

38:16.920 --> 38:17.910
Where is she?

38:19.130 --> 38:20.620
UP your ass!

38:53.873 --> 38:56.490
- Can you help?
- I'm going to drop my bags.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.958
Hello, my boy.

39:06.469 --> 39:10.633
- How long are you leaving this?
- Until I get the keys.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.432
Your mother made you rabbit.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.726
So where is your apartment?

39:25.655 --> 39:28.568
10 minutes from the new hospital.
It's nice.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.982
A balcony, a room for Julien.

39:32.412 --> 39:34.323
When does the hospital open?

39:35.748 --> 39:39.366
I already told you. September.
And I'll start then.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.503
Will you still come visit?

39:55.226 --> 39:58.594
The Dutrieuxs say hi.
We saw them at the wedding.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.850
Are they doing okay?

40:03.401 --> 40:06.109
We saw Laetitia too. My God...

40:08.698 --> 40:11.110
She won't find a guy like that.

40:11.284 --> 40:14.697
Last time we saw her
was two years ago.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.534
Regis' birthday party.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.245
God knows how much she weighs.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.081
She let herself go.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.167
She doesn't have an easy life.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.582
She lives all alone.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.010
- No excuse.
- Works nights.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.639
When she gets home,
it must be... 7am.

40:38.519 --> 40:39.930
She said she saw you.

40:40.063 --> 40:43.021
On her way home, with Josephine.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.940
- Where does she live?
- The projects.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.900
Why were you there?

40:48.237 --> 40:49.477
Remember Laetitia?

40:52.033 --> 40:53.239
It wasn't us.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.650
You got in a bus.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.326
Why were you there?

40:59.707 --> 41:02.039
- What were you doing?
- No big deal.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.908
Why where you there?

41:05.254 --> 41:07.461
To see Josephine's friend.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.670
But you got in a bus.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.794
We were leaving her place.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.258
To go where?

41:15.807 --> 41:18.344
- Stop, Antoine.
- To go where?

41:18.518 --> 41:19.633
SchooL

41:19.811 --> 41:21.802
- Stop, Antoine.
- Shut up.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.722
You saw her friend before school?

41:25.650 --> 41:26.981
Answer me!

41:27.735 --> 41:28.691
Stop it!

41:31.030 --> 41:33.442
You always have to fuck things up!

41:33.616 --> 41:36.483
Stupid idiot! You spoil everything!

41:37.036 --> 41:40.404
It could have been nice.
You make it impossible!

41:40.581 --> 41:43.243
Why must this happen each time?

41:43.418 --> 41:47.833
It's no surprise
that your kids won't see you!

41:48.131 --> 41:49.713
What'll you do now?

41:53.970 --> 41:56.758
- What are you doing?
- Get your stuff.

41:58.391 --> 42:01.600
Don't you ever set foot here again!

42:02.979 --> 42:04.014
Julien!

42:52.904 --> 42:54.360
Are you happy now?

43:03.372 --> 43:05.329
Do you think I'm a fool?

43:13.549 --> 43:15.131
You live in the projects?

43:16.427 --> 43:17.462
No.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.473
You're as big a liar as your mom.

43:31.943 --> 43:34.401
You're no dumber than before, are you?

43:36.364 --> 43:38.230
Look at me when I talk.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.483
Is it her boyfriend's place?

43:46.999 --> 43:50.663
She's holding a bomb
that'll blow up in her face.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.839
She's not allowed to do any of this!

43:56.008 --> 43:57.419
Understand?

43:58.594 --> 44:02.758
She'll pay for it big-time
if she keeps playing me for a fool!

44:03.307 --> 44:06.299
I'm your father!
I need to know where you live!

44:07.645 --> 44:10.808
Look at me when I talk!
Look at me!

44:15.695 --> 44:17.060
Where is it?

44:20.658 --> 44:22.148
Straight ahead.

44:43.222 --> 44:44.303
And now?

44:44.765 --> 44:46.130
Straight.

44:53.274 --> 44:54.639
Left.

45:01.157 --> 45:02.739
What floor are you on?

45:04.076 --> 45:05.407
Second.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.124
Right.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.254
Left.

45:25.598 --> 45:26.929
Right.

45:34.357 --> 45:36.018
It's her boyfriend's place?

45:37.276 --> 45:38.983
She has no boyfriend.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.329
Over there.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.208
That one? There?

45:59.257 --> 46:00.088
This one?

46:05.888 --> 46:07.219
Give rne your keys.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.470
Give rne your keys.

46:31.706 --> 46:33.288
Come with me.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.241
Leave your bags. Come.

46:54.478 --> 46:55.889
<i>Entrance refused.</i>

46:56.147 --> 46:56.978
Wait!

46:58.441 --> 46:59.397
Stop!

47:05.281 --> 47:06.396
Stop!

48:36.747 --> 48:37.987
Come on.

48:40.376 --> 48:41.832
I'm driving you back.

48:44.338 --> 48:47.672
Sweetie, I don't want trouble
every weekend.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.000
Get in!

48:53.639 --> 48:55.175
Come on, get in.

48:56.517 --> 48:57.632
Where are we going?

48:57.810 --> 49:01.223
Didn't you want to go
to your sister's party?

49:38.851 --> 49:40.512
Can I have my keys?

50:20.100 --> 50:21.682
Can I have my keys?

50:54.218 --> 50:56.050
I just called Laetitia.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.296
She said she saw you here.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.758
I don't want you to hit Mom.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.102
I'll find it by myself.

51:29.962 --> 51:31.498
What floor are you on?

51:32.965 --> 51:34.080
Eighth.

51:40.639 --> 51:41.970
Hello, ma'am.

52:35.778 --> 52:37.439
I'm not interrupting?

53:25.661 --> 53:27.243
What do you want?

53:30.207 --> 53:32.198
To see where my kids live.

53:39.299 --> 53:40.789
I have to go now.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.878
- Where's my daughter?
- At the reception hall.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.039
I've changed.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.364
I've changed.

57:00.208 --> 57:01.698
I have to go.

57:30.906 --> 57:32.567
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.403
No problem.

57:50.175 --> 57:52.212
What time should I come?

57:52.803 --> 57:54.919
We're sleeping at my parents'.

57:57.349 --> 57:58.714
11 o'clock?

57:59.518 --> 58:00.633
All right.

58:27.587 --> 58:29.294
Don't say he came.

58:29.673 --> 58:31.755
Say I bumped into you in town.

58:54.239 --> 58:57.277
- What's that?
- You don't make the law here.

59:12.049 --> 59:13.380
Where's Julien?

59:18.430 --> 59:21.388
At his mom's.
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

59:23.268 --> 59:24.758
Staying for dinner?

59:31.985 --> 59:33.942
It seems I'm not welcome.

59:41.453 --> 59:42.534
Do as you please.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.941
What did you and Josephine decide?

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.903
A song before or after the cake?

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.238
After.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.285
Can we serve it now?

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.287
She wants to wait for Manon.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.032
Where's Manon?

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:33.502
She'll call
when she gets off the highway.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.169
You can't drive 300 miles tonight.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.209
It's fine. I can drive.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:42.424
You can stay at Nana's.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.589
Don't worry. It's kind of you.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:48.054
I prefer to drive. I planned on it.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.103
You two can see each other,

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.188
but she can't skip classes.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.778
She has to graduate.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:01.613
You understand?

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.698
Yes, of course.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.243
So we'll wait for Manon.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.648
What are you doing, Miriam?

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.358
Have you seen Julien?

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.273
He must be inside.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.683
Come on,
Josephine is going to sing!

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.881
Why are you here?
My dad mustn't see you.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:44.140
I have a gift for Josephine.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.635
I'll give it to her.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.724
I left it in my car.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.770
Give it to her tomorrow
when you get Julien?

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.483
Isn't it humiliating enough
for me to be here?

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.220
What am I?

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.559
What's that stare?

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.567
What am I to you?

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.064
I can't reach you.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:27.281
You change numbers.
You run away from me.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.779
Who am I for you?

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:32.665
I won't talk about the same old stuff...

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.372
You will, because we had two kids!

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.167
When you vanish, you hurt me.
You know it.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.046
You need help.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:45.344
The nerve of you!
You're the one who needs help!

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:48.305
Coming!

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:49.804
Who's he?

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.760
My sister's friend.
I'm coming.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.271
Why is he at my daughter's party?

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:57.182
I'll deal with the cake.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.519
Cyril... Nice to meet you.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.363
I'm talking to my wife.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.952
- Have a nice evening.
- I'm coming.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.697
Give me Josephine's present.

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:54.114
You're such a tease.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.074
Let go of me!

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.117
Who is he?

01:10:57.628 --> 01:10:59.210
- Who is he?
- Stop it.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.246
Have you fucked him?

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:02.835
- Stop.
- Tell me.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:03.919
Let go of her!

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:07.965
We're just talking.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.131
Leave her alone! Fuck off!

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:12.799
I'm very calm.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:14.551
Beat it, prick.

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:17.266
Touch her again and I'll kill you!

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:22.142
- Kiss the kids for me.
- Fuck off!

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.856
I'm not talking to you.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.613
Fuck off
or I'll call the cops, asshole!

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:40.080
What a loser.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.303
- The prick left. He hit you.
- I'm fine.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:52.089
- File a complaint.
- What for?

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:55.054
I'll come with you.
This has to end.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.639
Come on...

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.266
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:15.036
Maybe I shouldn't come over tonight.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:19.658
Hi, ma'am.
What a pain to find this place.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.703
- Hey, Manon. Hungry?
- Starving.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.791
There's plenty to eat.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.667
It's up to you.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.505
My granddaughter!

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:19.888
What is it now?

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.848
I just don't want to.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.977
Let's say goodbye to your sister.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:29.276
See you tomorrow.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.031
- Can I drop you off?
- Cyril will.

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.909
Julien's staying with you?
Pick you up at 10.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.240
You'll be okay?

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.654
Goodnight.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.373
- He's not coming to Nana's?
- Not anymore.

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.003
Go to sleep. I'll clean up tomorrow.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:51.963
I'll just straighten up the equipment,
the cables...

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:54.924
- Don't keep Papy up.
- We have a key.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.883
Sleep well, kids.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:58.514
Goodnight, Mom.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.095
Goodnight.

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:02.139
See you tomorrow.

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.567
- Is it him?
- What do you think?

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.954
- Go to sleep.
- Can I sleep with you?

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.285
Come.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:54.121
When he gets fed up, he'll leave.

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:41.339
Did he leave?

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.584
I think so.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:29.613
Mom...

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.692
Our conversation isn't over.

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.130
Open up!

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:34.345
Open!

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.256
Open the door!

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:44.059
<i>B-O-U-H-A-D-D-L.</i>

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.600
<i>- Bouhadch.
- We're on the way.</i>

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.897
TN-821 for 71...

01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:57.117
<i>Yes?</i>

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:59.863
Saint-Dumont, 9 rue Winston Churchill.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.202
I repeat: Saint-Dumont,

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.242
9 rue Winston Churchill.

01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:07.082
Someone is forcing open a door.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:10.294
The neighbor says he has a large weapon,

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.128
like a hunting rifle.

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:16.091
It's taking place on the 8th floor.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.637
Use the intercom to enter the building.

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:22.268
The name is "Bouhaddi".

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.180
Bravo-Oscar-Uniform...

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:26.438
Dad, stop!

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:29.191
Antoine, please stop!

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.902
- Open up!
- Antoine, stop!

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:41.033
Mommy, I can't hear anything!

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.542
I can't hear anything, Mommy!

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:57.632
<i>- What's the emergency?
- He fired'.!</i>

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.342
What's the address?

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.799
<i>He'll Kill us!</i>

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.559
Where are you?

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:05.594
<i>He shot at the door!</i>

01:23:05.772 --> 01:23:08.230
I need your address. What address?

01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:10.899
- Antoine, stop!
- Open up!

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.440
<i>I need your address.</i>

01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:16.231
9 rue Winston Churchill.

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:17.648
<i>A car is coming.</i>

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.658
Do you know who fired?

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:20.989
My husband.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.992
<i>- You're not alone?
- With my son.</i>

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:32.580
Antoine, stop!

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:35.833
Keep calm.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.093
Do you have a room that locks?

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.511
<i>Yes.</i>

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.722
Go lock yourselves inside.

01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:43.098
Open up!

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.473
<i>Help is on the way.</i>

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:56.937
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:58.526
In the bathroom.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.190
Did you lock the door?

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.320
Can you block the door?

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:27.726
He's inside.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.728
Listen to me, ma'am.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.639
Do you have a bathtub?

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:34.566
Lie down in it with your son.

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:35.771
Take cover.

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:38.313
Get inside. Hurry up...

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:41.406
Get down.

01:24:42.286 --> 01:24:43.492
More, more.

01:24:47.165 --> 01:24:48.655
<i>Stay on the phone.</i>

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:50.745
<i>You're not alone. I'm with you.</i>

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:01.134
I'm with you. Don't worry.

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:02.340
A car is coming.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.343
<i>Just a few seconds. It's almost over.</i>

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:21.447
<i>Stay in the tub. Don't come out.</i>

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.052
Open up.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:03.943
Police! Drop your weapon!

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:10.655
<i>Stay put. The police are there.</i>

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:14.374
<i>You're in a safe place.
Don't move, okay?</i>

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:17.670
You're under arrest. Calm down!

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:18.874
Don't move!

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:20.873
<i>It's over, ma'am.</i>

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:25.965
<i>Stay on the phone with me.</i>

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.966
She's my wife!

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.306
Don't let them do this to me!

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:38.774
Get him out of here!

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:54.911
It's over, ma'am.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:58.536
<i>Hear me?</i>

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:01.421
It's over.

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:05.709
It's over.

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:10.173
