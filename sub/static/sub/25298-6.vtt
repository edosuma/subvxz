18:05.294 --> 18:07.006
I was in way over my head!

18:07.006 --> 18:08.798
I faked a blood test

18:08.798 --> 18:11.470
so that my teacher
would think I was sick!

18:11.470 --> 18:13.052
A blood test!

18:13.052 --> 18:15.054
I mean,
it's their fault really.

18:15.054 --> 18:17.807
They decide
everything I do!

18:17.807 --> 18:20.139
Easy, easy. We still
have time to figure it out.

18:20.139 --> 18:22.061
Well, of course,
unless your parents possess

18:22.061 --> 18:25.314
some kind of anger-induced
super-strength.

18:25.314 --> 18:26.435
- Aah!
- Aah!

18:26.435 --> 18:27.937
Remy Remington!

18:27.937 --> 18:30.730
You're in big trouble,
young man!

18:30.730 --> 18:32.191
We can explain. I--

18:32.191 --> 18:33.693
Wait. Your name's
Remy Remington?

18:33.693 --> 18:35.865
- Yeah. Why?
- No reason. [chuckles]

18:35.865 --> 18:37.446
And <i>you!</i>

18:37.446 --> 18:41.160
What qualifies you
to spend time with our child?

18:41.160 --> 18:42.081
- Well, I--
- [ribbits]

18:42.081 --> 18:45.204
Not now. Heh heh.

18:45.204 --> 18:46.666
- Hmm!
- Hmm!

18:46.666 --> 18:48.457
Well, this is
completely unnecessary.

18:48.457 --> 18:50.209
I can walk just fine.

18:50.209 --> 18:52.171
We're taking you
straight to boarding school.

18:52.171 --> 18:55.054
[whispering]
Remy, do it now!
Talk to them!

18:55.054 --> 18:56.846
Mmm...

18:56.846 --> 18:58.808
Uh, Mom, Dad?

18:58.808 --> 19:00.930
Can I not go
to boarding school?

19:00.930 --> 19:02.351
Now, now,
enough of that, son.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.604
We need to get you away
from these bad influences.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.396
Hey, I'm a good influence!

19:07.396 --> 19:08.978
When will I get
to see Cricket again?

19:08.978 --> 19:10.109
Hopefully, never.

19:10.109 --> 19:11.150
What?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.273
Remy!

19:14.273 --> 19:15.945
Remington!

19:15.945 --> 19:17.236
Tough break, kid.

19:17.236 --> 19:18.868
Master Remy seemed
really find of you.

19:18.868 --> 19:20.740
Now let's get you
back home.

19:20.740 --> 19:22.742
- [thumping in vent]
- Huh?!

19:22.742 --> 19:25.044
Whoopsie Daddle!
Cricket, run!

19:25.044 --> 19:26.285
Huh?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.339
Aaah yaah!

19:30.339 --> 19:32.091
Go, Cricket!

19:32.091 --> 19:33.673
Mr. and Mrs. Remington!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.094
Please listen to me!

19:35.094 --> 19:37.386
Oh, my goodness!
That boy is crazy!

19:37.386 --> 19:38.968
I know you don't
like me much,

19:38.968 --> 19:40.930
but I have something to say!

19:40.930 --> 19:42.101
[muffled gibberish]

19:42.101 --> 19:43.352
What is he saying?

19:43.352 --> 19:45.224
It's not important,
dear.

19:45.224 --> 19:47.106
Vasquez Senior,
shake him off
into the pool!

19:47.106 --> 19:49.188
Roger roger.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.270
[screaming]

19:51.270 --> 19:53.112
Ooh! He's
really holding on.

19:53.112 --> 19:54.984
Vasquez Senior,
shake harder!

19:54.984 --> 19:57.276
-[Mrs. Remington]
Who is that boy anyway?
-[growling]

19:57.276 --> 19:58.988
He's my friend!

19:58.988 --> 20:00.369
Remy?

20:00.369 --> 20:01.991
[inhales]

20:01.991 --> 20:03.953
I don't want to go
to boarding school!

20:03.953 --> 20:06.125
I don't like
calligraphy lessons,

20:06.125 --> 20:09.248
water polo lessons,
or cashmere sweaters!

20:09.248 --> 20:12.461
- [both gasp]
- I want to go outside more,

20:12.461 --> 20:14.093
and I want to make
my own decisions,

20:14.093 --> 20:15.715
like a big boy.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.137
Ahem. [deeper voice]
I mean, like a big boy.

20:18.137 --> 20:20.339
I like it
here in Big City.

20:20.339 --> 20:23.472
And I want to stay
here with my friend!

20:23.472 --> 20:27.266
Sweetie, where did you learn
to be so assertive?

20:27.266 --> 20:29.268
From him!

20:29.268 --> 20:31.851
[crazed laughter]

20:31.851 --> 20:33.442
Really?

20:33.442 --> 20:36.065
Your assertiveness lessons
were never this effective.

20:36.065 --> 20:37.987
Dear, maybe
letting Remy stay

20:37.987 --> 20:41.200
and allowing him
to interact with this "Cricket"

20:41.200 --> 20:43.162
is the best thing
for him right now.

20:43.162 --> 20:44.243
[gasps] Really?!

20:44.243 --> 20:45.414
You mean it?!

20:45.414 --> 20:47.076
Yeah! Huh?

20:47.076 --> 20:48.327
Aaah!

20:49.368 --> 20:51.000
Whoo!

20:52.461 --> 20:54.133
Remy! Remy!

20:54.133 --> 20:55.174
Cricket!

20:55.174 --> 20:58.007
- Remy!
- Cricket!

20:58.007 --> 21:00.179
[both laughing]

21:00.179 --> 21:02.221
Tilly!

21:02.221 --> 21:04.053
Remy, we wanted to say
two things to you.

21:04.053 --> 21:05.805
- Yes, Mother?
- We love you.

21:05.805 --> 21:07.146
Mwah.

21:07.146 --> 21:10.189
And we're late
for a meeting. Be good!

21:10.189 --> 21:11.150
Huh?

21:11.150 --> 21:12.982
[laughter]

21:12.982 --> 21:14.393
Vasquez, keep an eye
on Remy.

21:14.393 --> 21:16.695
Or else you're
outta the game, mister.

21:18.487 --> 21:21.200
Come on, Cricket,
let's go finish
that pig long jump.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.491
Whatever you want, Buddy.

21:22.491 --> 21:25.404
I think
it's Vasquez's turn.

21:25.404 --> 21:26.455
[Cricket]
Sounds good to me.

21:26.455 --> 21:28.247
