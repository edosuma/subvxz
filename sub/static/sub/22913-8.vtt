00:01.290 --> 00:03.290
- Goodbye.
- Isabella!

00:06.360 --> 00:08.490
Queen Elena's armies
have taken hostages.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.530
I'm sure your cousin
Joan will not let it pass.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.560
I should hope not.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.800
What kind of queen would I be
if I did not defend my people?

00:14.830 --> 00:16.670
The queen rode
out of Paris and into battle.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.170
And with child.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.070
Landry has been
with a married woman,

00:20.100 --> 00:21.740
one who bears his child.

00:21.770 --> 00:23.770
"I need more men, I.V."

00:23.810 --> 00:25.580
It means he was
working for someone.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.380
What's his name?
No mercies...

00:29.110 --> 00:30.750
I know who he's working for.
I need to warn Landr...

00:33.850 --> 00:35.390
We will be ready to serve you,

00:35.420 --> 00:37.090
once you find the Grail.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.590
I'm taking the Grail.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.860
You gave Tancrede
over to the Saracens

00:40.890 --> 00:42.230
knowing what they would
do to him.

00:42.260 --> 00:45.200
Don't make me kill you.

00:45.230 --> 00:48.370
This cup has made madmen
of us all.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.600
The Temple is not safe for you
or the Grail.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.400
Why?
You're making a mistake.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.500
Because this will be
the death of you.

00:54.540 --> 00:56.670
And because I'm your mother.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:18.360 --> 01:21.670
Cousin Joan, you are surrounded.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.900
You are outnumbered four to one.

01:23.930 --> 01:27.400
Elena, as your cousin...
your blood...

01:27.440 --> 01:30.270
I ask you not to continue
with this attack.

01:30.310 --> 01:32.540
Think of the loss of life
it will cause.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.450
You are a grieving mother.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.710
Do not let another woman
suffer as you suffer.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.920
You know nothing
about my suffering.

01:39.950 --> 01:42.890
In the castle
you're currently occupying

01:42.920 --> 01:45.360
lies our grandfather's grave.

01:45.390 --> 01:47.860
My son should be laid
to rest there,

01:47.890 --> 01:49.690
right next
to his great-grandfather,

01:49.730 --> 01:52.230
and I will not rest
until it is so.

01:52.260 --> 01:56.270
Elena, if this is about a grave,
let us end this here and now.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.240
You have my permission
to bury Lluis.

01:58.270 --> 02:00.340
Your permission?

02:00.370 --> 02:04.210
Elena, what do you want from me?

02:04.240 --> 02:06.740
If it's capitulation, you're
going to be disappointed.

02:06.780 --> 02:08.750
I will have your capitulation,

02:08.780 --> 02:10.910
but I want something else,
too...

02:10.949 --> 02:12.880
restitution.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.190
Restitution for my murdered son.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.760
I warn you,
your soldiers will die.

02:20.790 --> 02:22.630
My men will stand firm
until the arrival...

02:22.660 --> 02:23.930
Until what?

02:23.960 --> 02:26.830
Until your husband's
reinforcements come?

02:26.860 --> 02:29.500
I don't think so, my dear.

02:29.530 --> 02:32.540
You're behind with the news.

02:32.570 --> 02:35.540
Your husband
has changed his mind.

02:35.570 --> 02:38.740
No one's coming to save you.

02:38.780 --> 02:42.250
You're alone.

02:53.860 --> 02:56.790
Your Grace, these men come
with a letter from the King.

02:56.830 --> 02:59.500
Unfortunately, there is
disappointing news.

02:59.530 --> 03:01.800
He's not sending troops.

03:01.830 --> 03:05.940
You are to return to France
immediately.

03:05.970 --> 03:07.770
We must concede to your cousin.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.370
We most certainly will not!

03:56.020 --> 03:57.720
How thick are our walls?

03:57.750 --> 03:59.020
Not thick enough.

03:59.060 --> 04:00.460
And our supplies?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.890
A month of grain...
if we ration.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.390
Have the Merinos send word

04:04.430 --> 04:06.360
to their men
still in the countryside.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.760
Bring supplies and troops.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.870
Use the river
to enter the castle.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.670
What? Speak.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.740
You failed to halt
Elena's aggression

04:13.770 --> 04:16.440
and to secure reinforcements
from your husband.

04:16.470 --> 04:18.070
The Merinos think you're weak.

04:18.110 --> 04:19.779
They will not follow
your orders.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.750
Then they disobey their Queen.
And that is treason.

04:21.779 --> 04:23.010
Navarre has no Queen!

04:23.050 --> 04:24.410
This is not France.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.750
Our people do not revere titles.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.690
Your mother
never understood that.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.420
I am not my mother.

04:31.460 --> 04:33.460
And I would give my life
for my people.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.830
I fear you will,
if you remain here.

04:50.970 --> 04:53.080
Let him through!
Let him through.

05:05.720 --> 05:11.430
Brothers, it has been 15 years
since we lost Acre.

05:11.460 --> 05:15.400
And 15 years
since we lost this Holy Cup.

05:15.430 --> 05:19.540
But now it returns
to our safekeeping

05:19.570 --> 05:20.870
and that of the Church.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.970
Dear God.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.770
Gawain?

05:54.800 --> 05:57.170
I can't believe it.

05:57.210 --> 05:59.180
The pain in his leg
drove him to madness.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.810
Even so.
To try to kill his Master?

06:09.950 --> 06:13.090
He asked me to let him drink
from the Cup.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.590
And I refused.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.900
Perhaps I should have given him
what he wanted.

06:18.930 --> 06:21.700
This is not your fault.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.680
Any word from the Pope?

06:31.710 --> 06:33.510
He is on his way.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.610
Excuse me, Master.
May I have a word?

06:35.650 --> 06:38.980
What is it?

06:39.020 --> 06:40.850
It's Parsifal.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.890
He pretended to be
from the Temple in Genoa

06:42.920 --> 06:45.020
and took Roland out
to the Forest of Saint-Germain.

06:45.050 --> 06:48.860
He... He wanted to question him
away from Templar purview.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.460
Forgive me.

06:50.490 --> 06:53.660
I allowed myself
to be sworn to secrecy.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.030
I know I've done wrong,

06:56.070 --> 06:58.070
and...

06:58.100 --> 06:59.770
Parsifal has not returned.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.170
This is about the letter.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.070
What letter?

07:03.110 --> 07:06.110
Parsifal had a letter
from Roland, asking for help.

07:06.140 --> 07:07.640
Help from whom?

07:07.680 --> 07:10.010
He refused to say.

07:10.050 --> 07:11.950
But he signed himself "I.V."

07:11.980 --> 07:14.620
As in four?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.860
Why was I not told about this
before now?

07:18.890 --> 07:21.890
As you know, the prisoner
was to go to Genoa

07:21.930 --> 07:23.160
on the Pope's own authority.

07:23.190 --> 07:25.730
He was no longer our concern.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.060
Bring me the letter.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.000
Parsifal has it.

07:29.030 --> 07:32.700
Tell Ulric to take a dozen men
to Saint-Germain,

07:32.740 --> 07:35.000
find Parsifal, Roland,
and this letter immediately.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.940
The forest is huge.

07:36.970 --> 07:40.110
Then take every available man!

07:40.140 --> 07:42.010
Am I understood?!

07:49.620 --> 07:50.890
Come on.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.560
Any clue where to start
looking for the lad?

07:55.590 --> 07:57.790
None, I'm afraid.

08:24.890 --> 08:26.060
I have questions.

08:26.090 --> 08:28.260
Everyone has questions.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.660
How did you meet Godfrey?

08:30.690 --> 08:32.760
That's not what you wanted
to ask me.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.700
I will tell you
what I want to ask you.

08:34.730 --> 08:37.870
Big man, Master Templar.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.070
Who cares how I met Godfrey?

08:42.140 --> 08:44.770
He found me after Acre,

08:44.810 --> 08:46.780
after you came running
back to Paris

08:46.810 --> 08:48.180
with your tails
between your legs.

08:48.210 --> 08:49.910
So you knew I was here
this whole time?

08:49.950 --> 08:51.850
I did.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.750
I couldn't...

08:53.780 --> 08:55.350
come visiting for cake.

08:55.380 --> 08:59.120
I was...

08:59.160 --> 09:00.920
I was busy.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.230
Too busy for your own child?

09:02.260 --> 09:03.930
Yes! Don't bleat.

09:06.660 --> 09:09.070
Godfrey gave me a task.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.630
To protect the Grail.

09:10.670 --> 09:12.000
Keeping away was part of it.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.800
And I'm still protecting
the Grail.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.300
That's why you have to trust me

09:15.340 --> 09:17.040
when I say you can't give
the Grail to the Pope.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.780
Why not?

09:19.810 --> 09:21.750
If you don't give me
a good reason,

09:21.780 --> 09:23.150
I'll make my own decision.

09:23.180 --> 09:26.820
Landry, the people
who killed Godfrey

09:26.850 --> 09:28.120
are still out there.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.250
You don't think I know that?

09:30.290 --> 09:33.120
Master, there's a man here
to see you.

09:33.160 --> 09:36.060
Master Templar.

09:40.130 --> 09:42.030
Congratulations.

09:42.070 --> 09:45.800
You have retrieved the Cup.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.040
But I believe
we had an agreement.

10:09.090 --> 10:12.430
I gave you the information
you needed to find the Grail.

10:12.460 --> 10:15.130
Now we must work together
to keep it safe.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.300
No.

10:17.330 --> 10:20.370
It is the Holy Grail.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.140
It belongs in the Holy Church.

10:22.170 --> 10:23.840
This is the bargain
you struck with me.

10:23.870 --> 10:25.740
Then let me be damned
for breaking that bargain.

10:25.780 --> 10:28.340
Landry, he's right.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.720
- You know him?
- Rashid?

10:31.750 --> 10:34.420
We were never to meet
until this day.

10:34.450 --> 10:36.090
That was Godfrey's plan.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.720
A separation of powers
to protect the Grail.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.930
He knew the question,
you knew the answer,

10:41.960 --> 10:43.230
and I knew the location.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.230
So this is Godfrey's plan.

10:45.260 --> 10:47.360
Then why did you try to prevent
me from finding the Grail?!

10:47.400 --> 10:50.100
I never trusted you.

10:50.130 --> 10:53.240
You were always rash, foolhardy.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.840
Even in Acre.

10:54.870 --> 10:57.440
I have given my life
to the Grail.

10:57.470 --> 10:59.180
You know that.

10:59.210 --> 11:02.250
I also know you are sentimental.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.950
You have relationships.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.120
You are having a child.

11:07.150 --> 11:09.350
And you would torture me
for that?

11:09.390 --> 11:11.220
I needed to know
whether you had the mettle

11:11.250 --> 11:14.720
to make the decisions
that would come before you.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.830
And I still don't know.

11:16.860 --> 11:20.960
But now you have the Grail,
and we must keep it safe again.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.830
There are secure places
that Godfrey had prepared.

11:23.870 --> 11:25.500
You must choose one
to house the Grail.

11:25.530 --> 11:27.770
Then you will choose
a successor,

11:27.800 --> 11:29.740
just as Godfrey chose you.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.880
You will pick a question
only they can answer...

11:31.910 --> 11:33.940
No!
No more questions!

11:33.980 --> 11:36.480
Godfrey's way did not work
in Acre,

11:36.510 --> 11:38.250
and it did not work here.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.450
His Holiness, the Pope,
is on his way.

11:45.490 --> 11:47.360
I will give him the Cup,

11:47.390 --> 11:49.060
and together
we will take it to Rome.

11:49.090 --> 11:51.090
That's a mistake.

11:51.130 --> 11:53.160
He'll use it to call
for another crusade.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.100
That is his prerogative.
What for?

11:55.130 --> 11:57.230
So fools can fight
for the rest of time?

11:57.270 --> 12:01.270
I don't trust either of you.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.140
You took Tancrede.

12:03.170 --> 12:06.040
He was a good man.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.050
Twice the man I am,
and twice the man you are.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.450
Yes.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.280
A very good man.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.090
Master, we have received word...

12:16.120 --> 12:18.390
His Holiness, the Pope,
is arriving.

12:25.090 --> 12:27.030
I do have the mettle.

12:27.060 --> 12:31.270
To make my own choice
for the Grail.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.140
And I'm afraid neither of you
are part of it.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.280
Guards!

12:45.380 --> 12:47.880
Malraux didn't tell me
it was you.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.820
You didn't need to know.

12:50.850 --> 12:53.490
Why does the former Keeper
of the Seal require mercenaries?

12:53.520 --> 12:56.890
Because mercenaries are not
distracted by Gods or symbols.

12:56.930 --> 12:58.260
True.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.430
We worship coin
and the man who pays it.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.100
I want only your best men.

13:02.130 --> 13:04.830
The ones
who fought in the Crusades.

13:04.870 --> 13:08.070
I have plenty.
Skilled men.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.870
Bastards, to be honest.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.010
I may need some
sooner than I thought.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.510
How soon?
Soon.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.910
If you pay, we play.

13:15.950 --> 13:18.010
I will have the money.

13:18.050 --> 13:19.580
I thought you were
out of favour in court.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.390
Just a little.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.220
So how are you going to pay?

13:25.250 --> 13:26.960
Let me worry about that.

13:40.670 --> 13:43.040
Don't shout.

13:43.070 --> 13:45.980
I am an important man...
an adviser in the King's court.

13:46.010 --> 13:48.240
I know.
I appointed you.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.510
De Nogaret?
Shh.

13:50.550 --> 13:52.220
The King's Guard
is searching for you.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.480
The King's Guard
are out whoring,

13:53.520 --> 13:55.250
but let's not split hairs.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.390
What do you want?

13:56.420 --> 13:58.350
I am the King's adviser.

13:58.390 --> 14:01.990
And I intend to advise him.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.280
Is it true?

14:21.310 --> 14:23.910
Do you have it?
I do.

14:23.950 --> 14:27.520
Oh, God has truly blessed us
this day.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.480
So plain.

14:58.010 --> 15:00.020
Why should I be surprised?

15:00.050 --> 15:02.620
Jesus was a simple man.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.590
I'll escort you
and the Grail to Rome.

15:04.620 --> 15:08.420
I have enough men.
Fear not.

15:08.460 --> 15:10.460
Your work is done.

15:10.490 --> 15:13.000
What will you do now?

15:13.030 --> 15:15.060
With the Grail?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.100
I will launch a fresh Crusade.

15:17.130 --> 15:21.240
What better symbol to lead us
back to the Holy Land?

15:21.270 --> 15:22.410
Is that...

15:22.440 --> 15:24.110
What?

15:24.140 --> 15:27.110
I, too, imagined we would return

15:27.140 --> 15:29.750
to fight for the Holy Land.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.510
Now I wonder if the bloodshed,

15:31.550 --> 15:33.120
if the loss of life
solves anything.

15:33.150 --> 15:34.380
Oh, dear boy.

15:34.420 --> 15:36.090
This is the Saracens you've met.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.250
This is what they do...
They sow doubt.

15:38.290 --> 15:41.190
I told you to put this
out of your mind.

15:41.220 --> 15:44.190
This is a good thing.

15:44.230 --> 15:46.060
The word will spread.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.460
Our brothers across Europe
will hear the call.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.600
The armies of God
will be reborn.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.440
Keep the faith.

16:07.350 --> 16:11.250
Et benedictio
Dei omnipotentis, Patris,

16:11.290 --> 16:14.790
et Felii, et Spiritus Sancti.

16:14.820 --> 16:18.530
The men o were after the Grail,

16:18.560 --> 16:20.260
who killed Godfrey...

16:20.300 --> 16:22.130
They're still out there.

16:22.170 --> 16:24.670
The prisoner, Roland,
he was working for someone.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.570
Let it be, my son.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.400
We have the Grail.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.740
It is safe.

16:39.850 --> 16:42.420
He signed himself "I.V."

16:42.450 --> 16:43.550
As in four?

17:05.770 --> 17:08.480
How many knights
are left in the Temple?

17:08.510 --> 17:10.450
You said to send everyone.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.480
I want every remaining man
with me. Quickly.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.819
Master, what's going on?

17:13.849 --> 17:15.819
"I.V." is the mark
of a Pope's Guard.

17:15.849 --> 17:17.589
What?!

17:17.619 --> 17:19.290
The Pope's Guard
has Roman numerals

17:19.319 --> 17:20.690
on the back of their collar.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.230
Roland was working for the Pope.

17:23.260 --> 17:25.130
Come! Quickly!

17:30.130 --> 17:32.340
Holy Father.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.410
What's troubling you, my son?

17:37.440 --> 17:41.180
You told me not to pursue
the man behind Godfrey's death.

17:41.210 --> 17:44.210
Now I understand why.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.380
Your Guard.
Number IV.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.550
Goes by the name of Roland.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.890
We've seen a letter
he was going to send to you.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.860
Landry, someone's poisoning you
against me.

17:54.890 --> 17:56.660
I don't believe you.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.860
Why did you have Godfrey killed?

18:04.670 --> 18:06.400
He possessed the Grail,

18:06.440 --> 18:09.640
and he refused
to turn it over to the Church.

18:09.670 --> 18:11.740
There is a war to be fought,
Landry,

18:11.770 --> 18:13.740
not in the Holy Land, but here.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.480
The Cup has the power

18:15.510 --> 18:17.350
to bring together
all the countries of Europe

18:17.380 --> 18:19.180
into one single state.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.320
And this is the future
of our Church...

18:22.350 --> 18:26.160
Europe united
under the one true God.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.660
No heretics, no kings...

18:28.690 --> 18:30.590
Just you.

18:30.630 --> 18:33.660
I am the Pope.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.530
God will judge your papacy.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.930
God will.

18:37.970 --> 18:39.700
You won't.

18:44.570 --> 18:47.510
Lay down the Grail.
You cannot win this, Landry!

19:23.350 --> 19:24.450
Pierre!

19:25.610 --> 19:26.680
Don't let them out!

19:29.990 --> 19:33.220
Pierre!
What are you doing?

19:34.290 --> 19:36.460
Traitor!
I will kill you!
No!

19:36.490 --> 19:37.590
Kill them all!

19:37.630 --> 19:39.660
Get His Holiness to safety!

19:45.570 --> 19:47.300
Don't be a fool!

19:47.340 --> 19:49.940
There are too many of them.

19:49.970 --> 19:51.370
You've lost the Grail.

19:51.410 --> 19:53.440
You're not throwing away
your life.

20:11.490 --> 20:13.600
I don't like it.

20:13.630 --> 20:14.900
She knows we're outnumbered.

20:14.930 --> 20:17.800
Why doesn't she move against us?

20:17.830 --> 20:19.670
Perhaps Queen Elena
was more struck

20:19.700 --> 20:21.840
by your courage
than she revealed?

20:24.440 --> 20:29.510
Thank you, but I fear nobody
here was struck by my courage.

20:29.550 --> 20:33.850
My mother left me in France
when I was just a girl.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.320
She abandoned Navarre,
and she abandoned me.

20:37.350 --> 20:42.330
I was scared and alone.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.490
It's her weakness
that my people here see in me.

20:45.530 --> 20:47.860
You are not weak, Your Grace.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.930
Of course I am.

20:50.970 --> 20:53.470
I'm weak, and I'm foolish.

20:55.570 --> 20:58.370
I'm my mother's daughter.

20:58.410 --> 21:00.610
Your Grace, there is still time
to get you to safety.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.410
No.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.950
Your Grace's presence
is requested

21:05.980 --> 21:08.050
at a meeting of the War Council.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.320
Who called this meeting?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.660
I did, Your Grace.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.090
Next time,
seek my permission first.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.560
Of course, Your Grace.

21:32.580 --> 21:33.540
Cousin.

21:35.910 --> 21:37.910
Elena.
How did...

21:37.950 --> 21:41.620
This castle is even finer
than I remembered.

21:41.650 --> 21:44.490
Bastard.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.460
Your Grace will forgive me.

21:46.490 --> 21:48.690
King's orders... no bloodshed.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.830
You are to return to France.
And to him.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.830
You may leave us, Governor.

21:52.860 --> 21:55.460
But our agreement was that
I would take the Queen to Paris.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.100
Perhaps you will.

21:57.130 --> 21:58.930
First I have business with her.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.060
Your Grace.

22:24.090 --> 22:26.430
My apologies
for the interruption.

22:26.460 --> 22:28.900
What is it, Nicholas?

22:28.930 --> 22:31.100
I'll have your head
for this, boy!

22:31.130 --> 22:33.000
Nicholas had no choice.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.770
I would have had his head
if he did not bring me here.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.640
- Guards.
- Listen to me.

22:36.670 --> 22:38.140
Your Grace, please, you need
to hear what I have to say.

22:38.170 --> 22:40.780
- Guards!
- The Holy Grail is in France.

22:44.550 --> 22:46.450
Leave us.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.080
The Holy Grail.
The Cup of Christ.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.520
I know what it is.
But it is
more than just a cup.

22:50.550 --> 22:51.990
It is the means
with which the Pope

22:52.020 --> 22:54.420
will attempt
to supplant you as King.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.030
I have not missed your papal
conspiracies, De Nogaret.

22:57.060 --> 23:00.060
Your Grace, you are in the
utmost danger from all sides.

23:00.100 --> 23:01.830
There is an army on French soil,

23:01.860 --> 23:04.070
trained and funded
like no other army in history,

23:04.100 --> 23:06.670
and loyal not to you,
but to the Pope.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.670
So this is about the Templars.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.470
No, this is
about securing your throne.

23:11.510 --> 23:15.010
I have mustered an army of
mercenaries... the Red Knights.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.150
Men who know war and know
how the Templars fight.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.680
I do not need an army
to fight the Templars!

23:19.720 --> 23:21.750
The Temple Master
is my closest friend!

23:21.780 --> 23:24.050
Your Grace, Landry Du Lauzon
is not your friend.

23:24.090 --> 23:25.490
You're right.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.120
He's my brother.

23:27.160 --> 23:30.130
Then Your Grace will forgive me,

23:30.160 --> 23:32.630
but your brother
is sleeping with your wife.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.150
You've won.

23:55.180 --> 23:57.190
What more do you want from me?

23:57.220 --> 23:59.860
I told you.

24:02.590 --> 24:04.830
Reparation.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.130
For my son's death.

24:08.900 --> 24:12.540
I watched him burn alive

24:12.570 --> 24:17.140
after he tried to save
your daughter on your soil.

24:17.170 --> 24:18.740
Where he should have been safe.

24:18.770 --> 24:20.780
Lluis' death is a tragedy,

24:20.810 --> 24:22.240
but the levels
of De Nogaret's treachery

24:22.280 --> 24:23.610
could not be foreseen.

24:23.650 --> 24:25.650
De Nogaret did not act alone.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.550
He had an accomplice...
your daughter.

24:28.580 --> 24:30.690
No! Isabella herself
was nearly killed!

24:30.720 --> 24:32.090
Yet she leapt from the carriage

24:32.120 --> 24:34.560
the moment
before it went up in flames.

24:34.590 --> 24:37.230
You know she was involved,
don't you?!

24:39.030 --> 24:42.600
I lost a child, cousin.

24:42.630 --> 24:45.030
Now you will lose one, too.

24:45.070 --> 24:47.700
You choose:

24:47.740 --> 24:53.310
either the scheming strumpet
back in France...

24:53.340 --> 24:56.550
or...

24:56.580 --> 25:00.050
the one that grows in your womb.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.200
They have at least 30 men
out there.

25:18.230 --> 25:20.840
That's too many
to fight our way through.

25:20.870 --> 25:23.040
We can't keep them out
forever.
We don't have to.

25:23.070 --> 25:25.170
We just have to hold out until
Ulric gets back with the others.

25:25.210 --> 25:26.880
What if they don't return
in time?

25:26.910 --> 25:28.340
We cannot get to the armoury.

25:28.380 --> 25:30.210
We'll have to fight
with what we have.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.110
Gather every weapon
you can find.

25:32.150 --> 25:34.750
Rashid...

25:34.780 --> 25:37.150
I'm sorry.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.660
I should have listened.

25:43.790 --> 25:45.790
Enter formation!

26:09.820 --> 26:12.090
Landry saved my marriage,

26:12.120 --> 26:14.290
spoke to the Queen on my behalf,

26:14.320 --> 26:18.130
convinced the Queen
to return to my bed.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.660
He is the reason
we are having another child.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.300
A child that is not yours.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.070
By God, you have some nerve.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.630
Your Grace, think for a moment.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.740
She would not share your bed
for two years.

26:27.770 --> 26:29.240
But then we were reconciled.

26:29.270 --> 26:32.070
I would guess after she
discovered she was with child.

26:32.110 --> 26:35.640
So that she could hide
her transgression from you.

26:38.410 --> 26:39.920
How do you claim to know this?

26:39.950 --> 26:41.350
I have a man inside the Temple.

26:41.380 --> 26:42.990
Landry confessed to him.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.120
He mentioned Joan by name?

26:45.150 --> 26:46.960
Not exactly, Your Grace.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.720
Well, then this is
all hearsay...

26:48.760 --> 26:50.390
slander. Lies.

26:50.430 --> 26:54.760
Your Grace, if she did not come
to your bed for two years,

26:54.800 --> 26:57.200
whose bed was she going to?

27:07.010 --> 27:09.140
Guards!

27:09.180 --> 27:11.680
Confine him to his office.

27:11.710 --> 27:14.180
He's not to leave the Palace.

27:24.960 --> 27:25.890
Do you know how to use that?

27:25.930 --> 27:27.160
Here.

27:32.330 --> 27:35.140
Attack!

27:39.440 --> 27:41.080
Seal the doors.

27:41.110 --> 27:43.180
Seal the doors!

27:57.230 --> 27:58.960
Aah!

28:01.130 --> 28:02.360
Rashid!

28:07.170 --> 28:09.000
Rashid...

28:16.950 --> 28:18.350
Hold him.

28:20.380 --> 28:23.020
Bite it.

28:51.510 --> 28:54.350
I did the same thing
for your son.

28:54.380 --> 28:56.920
He didn't scream half as much
as you.

28:59.290 --> 29:01.520
You showed him kindness.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.930
It wasn't enough to save him.

29:03.960 --> 29:08.160
He died in service of the Grail.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.230
It was an honourable death.

29:17.310 --> 29:19.270
What will we do, though, now?

29:30.020 --> 29:31.190
Your Grace.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.130
I cannot believe
my army has capitulated.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.460
What other choice did they have?

29:40.500 --> 29:43.800
Your Governor told them
it was France's wish.

29:46.270 --> 29:48.900
Forgive me, Your Grace,
but, uh...

29:48.940 --> 29:51.410
Queen Elena
requests your decision.

30:21.500 --> 30:24.210
So, cousin.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.470
Which of your bastards
will it be?

30:26.510 --> 30:29.040
You cannot ask a mother
to give up a child.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.550
That is exactly what I'm asking.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.580
Elena, please.

30:43.990 --> 30:48.160
Choose one, or I'll choose both.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.000
Choose!
Isabella!

30:51.030 --> 30:53.470
Good choice.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.140
There is justice there.

30:55.170 --> 30:56.570
She thought
Lluis had betrayed her.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.140
You must understand:

30:58.170 --> 31:00.010
She was being manipulated
by De Nogaret.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.510
Blood must be repaid with blood.

31:02.540 --> 31:04.980
You will see
that she is brought to Navarre.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.590
Her death
will not ease your pain.

31:14.190 --> 31:17.430
Sometimes at night,
I can still smell him burning.

31:19.460 --> 31:24.670
My... My son.

31:24.700 --> 31:27.470
My flesh and blood...

31:32.210 --> 31:34.580
Give me your hand.

31:34.610 --> 31:38.350
This baby in my belly...
It, too, is your blood.

31:43.550 --> 31:46.220
I feel it.

31:46.250 --> 31:49.160
I feel it.

31:49.190 --> 31:52.260
Oh, God.

31:52.290 --> 31:54.400
What am I doing?

31:54.430 --> 31:58.130
What... What am I doing?

31:59.670 --> 32:02.540
Something any mother would do.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.140
Defend her child.

32:58.260 --> 33:02.130
Catalans!

33:02.160 --> 33:03.470
Your Queen is dead.

33:05.530 --> 33:10.240
I came here to fight you
in defense of my homeland.

33:10.270 --> 33:12.510
But I have seen
how readily your people and mine

33:12.540 --> 33:15.780
stand alongside one another.

33:15.810 --> 33:17.450
You do not want this enmity.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.150
And you never wanted it.

33:20.180 --> 33:24.490
Let this day
be the last day of blood

33:24.520 --> 33:27.160
between our two countries.

33:27.190 --> 33:31.330
And let it be the first day
of the longest peace

33:31.360 --> 33:34.460
between Catalonia and Navarre.

33:53.850 --> 33:56.450
Real!
Queen Joan!

33:56.480 --> 33:59.690
Real!
Real!

34:11.630 --> 34:14.670
We've sealed all the doors.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.510
Do you hear that?

34:19.540 --> 34:20.679
They're on the roof.

34:28.620 --> 34:32.150
That is quicklime!

34:32.190 --> 34:34.260
Move! Move.

34:34.290 --> 34:35.560
Move!

34:35.590 --> 34:37.560
Everybody, get out now!

34:37.590 --> 34:39.659
It's poison!
To the entrance hall!

34:39.690 --> 34:41.300
Move! Move!

34:59.280 --> 35:01.280
A part of me would kill you,
De Nogaret,

35:01.320 --> 35:03.120
and have all of this go away.

35:05.620 --> 35:09.790
My life depends upon your
wisdom and mercy, Your Grace.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.630
I require proof.

35:14.660 --> 35:16.660
I will introduce you
to my man in the Templars.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.430
Not testimony.
Proof.

35:19.470 --> 35:23.440
I will look into this, and if
you are wrong, De Nogaret...

35:23.470 --> 35:26.340
Believe me, Your Grace,
I wish I were wrong.

35:26.370 --> 35:30.510
About the threat
from the Templars.

35:30.550 --> 35:32.410
And about your wife.

35:34.420 --> 35:36.450
Guards.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.230
What's this?

35:49.260 --> 35:52.570
To pay for your mercenary army.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.440
In case you're right.

36:11.320 --> 36:15.720
Your Grace,
our countries are united.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.590
Catalonia has pledged support
for the Queen of Navarre.

36:20.730 --> 36:23.430
Evidently your cousin
was not popular there.

36:23.470 --> 36:26.400
And you?

36:26.430 --> 36:28.270
Will you return to Paris?

36:28.300 --> 36:30.470
Yes.

36:30.510 --> 36:32.910
But I may be back
sooner than you think.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.480
It will be our privilege.

36:35.510 --> 36:38.550
Thank you.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.890
You intend to return?

36:43.920 --> 36:45.220
Yes.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.720
I will bring Isabella here.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.630
Away from the corruption
of the French court.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.260
And then I will bring
my child into the world

36:55.300 --> 36:57.330
under the skies of Navarre.

36:57.370 --> 36:59.430
Will the King allow it?

36:59.470 --> 37:00.740
The time has come

37:00.770 --> 37:04.440
for independence
from France, Sophie.

37:04.470 --> 37:06.710
Both for myself and Navarre.

37:10.950 --> 37:13.050
Forgive me, Your Grace,

37:13.080 --> 37:16.050
but this new life
of which you speak...

37:16.080 --> 37:18.520
will it include
the child's father?

37:18.550 --> 37:22.590
If he will have me.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.330
We're running out of time.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.290
We're gonna have to charge
out of the main doors.

37:26.330 --> 37:28.960
A frontal attack,
take them by surprise.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.600
Pierre has
at least 30 men out there.

37:31.630 --> 37:34.770
We have no other choice.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.770
Fall in behind me!

37:36.800 --> 37:40.710
Look to your training.

37:40.740 --> 37:43.410
Use God's strength
to quiet your mind.

37:43.450 --> 37:44.950
We are His soldiers.

37:44.980 --> 37:49.020
And, remember,
we answer only to God,

37:49.050 --> 37:52.020
and we fight for God.

37:52.050 --> 37:54.460
And we win

37:54.490 --> 37:56.560
by the Grace of God!

37:56.590 --> 37:58.090
By the Grace of God!

37:58.130 --> 38:00.400
Wait!

38:00.430 --> 38:01.930
Rashid?

38:04.530 --> 38:06.500
Let me help.

38:15.010 --> 38:16.610
Here they come!

38:16.640 --> 38:18.550
Ready!

38:18.580 --> 38:21.620
Charge!

38:34.000 --> 38:35.100
Aah!

39:26.680 --> 39:30.820
Looks like my time as a Templar
has come to an end.

39:38.530 --> 39:39.860
You were never a Templar.

39:44.570 --> 39:46.630
Landry!

39:46.670 --> 39:48.870
Landry.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.530
Place these on my son's grave.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.630
It would be an honour to do so.

40:13.660 --> 40:18.100
Forgive me.

40:18.130 --> 40:22.140
It suited me
to let you think he would die.

40:22.170 --> 40:25.640
Who would die?

41:05.280 --> 41:08.150
Tancrede.

41:08.180 --> 41:11.120
Master.
