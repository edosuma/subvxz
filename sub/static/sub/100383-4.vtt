Oh, yes!

00:11.720 --> 00:13.480
Oh, my God, yes!

00:13.560 --> 00:14.920
- No.
- Yes.

00:15.000 --> 00:15.840
No.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.240
Shit.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.400

-I've got you. Come--

00:32.560 --> 00:33.480
Yes.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.360
-What do you want to do now?
-Shall we kiss for a bit?

00:38.040 --> 00:38.920
Yeah.

00:39.000 --> 00:39.880
Yeah.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.760
I've been thinking.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.080
-Mm-hmm.
-Maybe we should...

00:49.640 --> 00:50.920
Maybe we should go all the way.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.120
Yeah?

00:55.160 --> 00:56.360
It's kind of a big step.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.280
I think I'm ready.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.080
Are you sure?

01:01.320 --> 01:02.800
Yeah, I am.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.120
But if you're not ready...

01:06.200 --> 01:07.920
No, I'm ready.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.440
Let's go all the way.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.280
Have you got a condom?

01:20.840 --> 01:22.640
-Oh, you mean--
-What's wrong?

01:22.720 --> 01:24.880
Ooh. I just didn't realize you meant,
like, right now.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.040
Well, yeah. Yeah. We just said
we wanted to do it, so I just--

01:28.120 --> 01:30.960
I think we just need some time to prepare

01:31.040 --> 01:34.360
because we only get our first time once
and we want it to be right.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.320
How about tomorrow night?

01:38.360 --> 01:39.200
Okay.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.680
We're gonna have sex.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.480

02:59.920 --> 03:01.600
Something special after school?

03:01.680 --> 03:04.080
No, it's just the shirt was clean, so...

03:04.880 --> 03:06.840
-What are you doing?
-You missed a spot.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.280
Mm.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.920
-I've got to go.
-Would you like a lift?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.800
-Absolutely not.
-Smoothie?

03:15.880 --> 03:17.160
No!

03:21.320 --> 03:23.200
I think you need a new pan shelf.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.360
No, it's fine,

03:26.360 --> 03:27.200
but thanks.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.720
Do you think you could take
some stuff with you today?

03:30.800 --> 03:31.720
What stuff?

03:32.160 --> 03:34.320
Your things.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.840
-Sure.
-Thank you.

03:38.520 --> 03:39.480
Things.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.080
And this. Every penny counts.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.360
The small pennies. So, I'm off.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.720
Cooking dinner tonight.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
See you.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.880
Which one of these looks the smartest?

04:04.640 --> 04:07.360
-Where are you going?
-I've got a job interview this afternoon.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.440
PA at a swanky law firm.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.160
What?

04:11.680 --> 04:13.640
Nothing. It's good to aim high, Erin.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.800
Can we cut the Erin shit? It's Mum.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.360
-That one.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.560
No, no, no, no, no, no!
These are important.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.560
Dickhead.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.680
Don't call your sister a dickhead,
she's three.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.320
Half sister.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.560
- What are they for?
-None of your business.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.280
Hi, Cynthia.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.760
-Thought you hated her?
-Yeah, she's a nosy cow but she's agreed

04:39.840 --> 04:43.360
to look after Elsie later,
so smile and wave.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.000
Mmm.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.680
Mmm.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.680
Have a good day at school.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.520
-Oh, maybe we could hang out later.
-No, thanks.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.280
"No, thanks."

04:57.760 --> 04:59.560
Ooh!

05:01.800 --> 05:02.920
Hi, Adam.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.800
Can we talk...

05:06.920 --> 05:09.560
-about what happened?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.040
Yes, you do.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.040
Ah...

05:23.120 --> 05:24.400
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.840
-Do you want to ride to school together?
-Yeah, sure.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.360
Um...

05:29.920 --> 05:32.200
For you to read next.
Did you finish Neruda?

05:32.840 --> 05:34.920
Yeah! Yeah, I loved him.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.200
That guy has got such a way with words.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.920
He's very poetic, isn't he?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.560
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.240
Yeah, yeah.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.040
It's just a bus.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.040
It's just a bus.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.640
On or off, love?

06:01.280 --> 06:02.840
Actually, I'm gonna walk.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.360
-Moordale Secondary's quite a trek.
-It's okay. I love walking.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.280
See you later.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.280
-Riding to school with Rahim, are we?
-No.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.160
I was doing something else
and I ran into him.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.480
Mm-hmm.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.880
-Do I sense a hint of jealousy?
-What were you doing?

06:41.280 --> 06:42.400
Nothing important.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.960
Why are you wearing your best shirt?

06:48.360 --> 06:50.200
-Well...
-Uh-huh...

06:50.760 --> 06:51.880
Ola and I...

06:53.040 --> 06:55.040
-might be going all the way tonight.
-No.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.000
No! You're gonna be deflowered?

06:58.080 --> 07:00.120
Otis, you're gonna be deflowered!
Come on!

07:00.200 --> 07:01.400
Stop.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.840
-Why are you not excited, man?
-I am. I am excited.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.440
-I'm just nervous.
-Don't. Don't...

07:06.520 --> 07:09.160
-Overthink. I know. I just...
-A-ha. Uh-huh.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.040
Okay, you can't laugh.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.240
I always...

07:16.000 --> 07:19.480
kind of thought I'd be in love
with the person I lost my virginity to

07:19.560 --> 07:21.920
and we haven't said that yet.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.400
-You can laugh if you want.
-Yes!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.040
No, I actually think it's nice.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.200
-But you really like Ola, right?
-Yeah. I like her a lot.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.080
And really liking someone
is pretty close to love, isn't it?

07:36.800 --> 07:37.880
Yeah, I guess so.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.520
But also, you don't have to do it
if you're not ready.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.040
I am ready. I'm ready.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.200
-I am ready.
-You're ready?

07:44.280 --> 07:45.960
-I really like Ola.
-Uh-huh.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.720
-She really likes me.
-A-ha.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.280
-We are going to have sex tonight.
- You're going to have sex tonight!

07:52.240 --> 07:53.240
Can you calm down?

07:54.040 --> 07:58.400
If I think about my clitoris
really, really hard, I can come.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.880
Seventeen times a day is quite excessive.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.840
I know.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.600
I want to experiment with role play

08:05.680 --> 08:08.720
but he's only just become comfortable
with dirty talk, so how soon is too soon?

08:08.800 --> 08:10.240
You won't know unless you ask.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.880
You always need to wash your penis.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.600
-Always?
-Always.

08:15.880 --> 08:20.440
"If I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine,

08:20.520 --> 08:22.960
the gentle fine is this. My lips...

08:24.520 --> 08:28.320
two blushing pilgrims ready stand
to smooth that rough touch

08:28.880 --> 08:29.880
with a tender kiss."

08:30.680 --> 08:33.520
"Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
which mannerly devotion shows in this;
for saints have--"

08:36.680 --> 08:40.240
Stop. Florence, this is a play
about horny teenagers.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.520
I don't believe you want to have sex
with him at all.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.920
And, Jackson, you're a terrible actor.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.960
I don't think
you're supposed to talk to us like that.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.160
I'm not a teacher.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.000
-Oi, Romeo. Show us your tights!

08:57.080 --> 08:58.600
Yeah, I borrowed your dad's.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.760
Juliet is a role of a lifetime for me,
so you better learn your lines.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.480
This isn't a joke to everyone.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.560
All right.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.880
Okay.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.800
I have no idea why they gave him the part.
He's terrible.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.840
He's Jackson Marchetti.
Who cares if he can't act?

09:14.920 --> 09:17.960
And I heard since he broke up with Maeve,
he'll basically have sex with anyone.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.560
-Oh, he's not really my type.
-No one's ever your type.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.640
-You're so picky, Florence.
- Yeah.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.520
The shade is called "Lustering."

10:01.600 --> 10:03.160
Oh, it's just gorgeous.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.920
-I'll write it down.
-No, um...

10:06.400 --> 10:07.880
-You can keep it.
-Oh.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.320
That's very kind. Thank you.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.120
Are you sure there wasn't anything else
you wanted to talk to me about?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.480
This is a safe space.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.440
Well...

10:29.680 --> 10:33.880
Sometimes I feel like
my life is moving by so quickly.

10:35.520 --> 10:36.880
I can't help thinking,

10:37.520 --> 10:40.440
"Am I really going to die
sleeping next to a man...

10:42.680 --> 10:44.840
...who hasn't touched me...

10:45.960 --> 10:46.880
properly...

10:47.840 --> 10:49.600
in nearly six years?"

10:51.440 --> 10:53.920
It is a dilemma that many couples face.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.840
It is possible to reignite passion.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.080
What would you suggest?

11:02.720 --> 11:03.600
Well, can you...

11:04.400 --> 11:07.120
start by telling me
a bit about your relationship?

11:35.600 --> 11:38.280
Do you have condoms?
I didn't bring any, which was stupid.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.520
I can go home and get some or ask my mum.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.400
Mm. Don't ask your mum.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.000
Okay, yeah. That's...

11:44.080 --> 11:46.000
-It's okay. I'll get some.
-...a bit weird.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.560
-Hey, arsehat.
-Hey.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.760
Hi. Sorry to interrupt,
it's just clinic stuff.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.080
Cool.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.200
See you tonight.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.000
Hey! Okay.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.440
What's happening tonight?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.680
Nothing unusual.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.720
We're just hanging out. You know,

12:03.280 --> 12:05.960
-boyfriend, girlfriend, hang times.
-Cool.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.360
You've got a 3:45 appointment.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.480
Uh... Ooh. Uh...

12:10.560 --> 12:12.160
-I'm not sure.
-Otis.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.600
Your mum has taken all our clients.
Please just be there.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.960
Piss off, Erin.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.240
Who's Erin?

12:20.320 --> 12:22.640
My mum. She's been staying with me.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.000
Well, that's a big deal.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.360
Why didn't you say anything?

12:27.440 --> 12:30.880
We don't really hang out anymore, Otis,
you're always with your girlfriend.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.400
Well, you could have told me.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.480
It's fine.
Don't be late for the appointment.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.760
-I need your help.
-I'm cramming here, Jackson.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.280
But I've started rehearsals
and apparently, I'm bad at acting.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.080
Hey. I need you to explain it to me
like you did for the audition.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.640
That was a onetime thing.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.720
I'm here to help you
with English or maths,

12:53.800 --> 12:55.400
not turn you into Olivier.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.240
Who's Olivier? I'm playing Romeo.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.160
-Can I meet you later?
-No,

13:01.240 --> 13:02.680
because I'm chairing that algebra group

13:02.760 --> 13:05.360
and then I have to write a letter
to my Polynesian pen pals.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.400
Other people do have lives too. Sorry.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.280
-Hey, heats start in 20, right?
- Yes, they do start in 20.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.920
- Right, see you in a bit, Bev.
-See you in a bit, Dex.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.840
Did he just call you "Bev"?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.440
That's Dex, he's on the quiz team.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.120
Vivian Odusanya has a crush.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.480
No, I don't. That was normal.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.640
Mm.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.560
-I am late.
-Hey.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.280
Let's make a deal.
I'll help you get that weird guy

13:33.360 --> 13:36.520
-if you help me with Shakespeare.
-No, thanks.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.760
Come on. I can't humiliate myself
in front of the whole school.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.000
Bev! Viv!

13:45.920 --> 13:47.440
I've been trying to call you.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.480
Apparently, the queen of the caravan park
has had to take Jonathan to the vets,

13:51.560 --> 13:55.040
so I need someone to look after Elsie.
I am late for my interview.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.520
-I can't.
-Please, please, Frogface.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.880
If I get this job,
I can get us a proper flat.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.040
A new start for you, for me, for Els.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.400
-Fine.
-You are a gem.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.920
-Okay.
-She's going to drop off any minute.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.200
Christ.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.720
She's gonna get us disqualified.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.720
Look how smug Let's Get Quizzy are.
Makes me sick.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.280
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.360
Nice bow tie.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.000
-Who's that?
-That's Elsie, she's my sister. Sort of.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.320
She's mainly a dickhead.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.160
Your mum's back and you have a sister.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.120
Yeah, I'm late for the quiz heats.
Could you take her with you

14:56.200 --> 14:57.360
to your appointment?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.840
I won't be long, and she'll stay asleep
and you can forget she's even there.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.800
I don't really know how
to look after a child. Um...

15:04.880 --> 15:05.800
Please.

15:08.040 --> 15:08.920
Fine. Yeah.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.040
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked you.
It's fine.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.680
Um... Yeah, I'll find someone else.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.480
Uh, wait. Um...

15:16.880 --> 15:18.080
I could...

15:18.560 --> 15:20.560
I can take her, yeah. I think.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.360
-Yeah?
-It'll be fine, right?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.400
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.800
Okay. Great, thank you. Thanks.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.240
That's all right. Um, good luck.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.120
Okay, Miss Sands,
we'll have to give the place

15:32.200 --> 15:34.520
to Let's Get Quizzy by default if--

15:47.240 --> 15:49.040
Question number one...

15:56.360 --> 15:57.680
You dumb dog.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.600
Hi. You're new.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.480
I work here too. I'm Ola.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.160
Oh.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.440
-Do you want to buy something?
-Yeah.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.080
Uh, packet of condoms, please.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.520
Didn't you used to go to my school?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.920
I've just started,
so I think I just missed you.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.320
Do you know Otis and Eric?

16:25.960 --> 16:27.320
-Not really.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.440
-Hi, Ola.
-Hey.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.120
-Is he a friend?
-Yeah, sort of.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.400
He's kind of dating Eric.
They're so cute together, it's ridiculous.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.240
Anyway, it was nice to meet you, Adam.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.320
I'll see you on my next shift. Cheers.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.880
What are you looking at?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.280
Hello?

17:11.920 --> 17:12.960
Hi, Jeanie.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.800
-Remi?
-Yeah, um...

17:17.400 --> 17:19.160
Spare key's in the, uh...

17:19.840 --> 17:22.200
in the flower pot by the door.
I hope you don't mind.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.280
I didn't know you were in the country.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.720
Last-minute book tour?

17:26.800 --> 17:29.240
Eh, no, just, uh... Just here to see Otis.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.480
-I had a few days off, so...
-He's not here.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.240
-You could have called, Remi.
-Well, you know me, uh...

17:38.000 --> 17:39.720
Mr. Spontaneous.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.720
-How have you been, Jeanie?
-You know I hate it when you call me that.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.560
Dr. Milburn.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.400
I hope you like trout.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.360
This is Jakob, my...

17:59.840 --> 18:00.920
Boyfriend.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.440
And this is Remi, my...

18:05.000 --> 18:05.880
Ex-husband.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.480
Great.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.280
Now we've all met.

18:09.360 --> 18:12.440
I don't want to impose.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.560
I'll head to the hotel
and see Otis in the morning--

18:14.640 --> 18:16.240
Would you like to stay for dinner?

18:17.200 --> 18:18.680
Oh, that's lovely. Thank you.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.200
I need a drink.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.160
<i>Next question.</i>

18:28.720 --> 18:31.520
What is the largest moon of Saturn?

18:31.920 --> 18:32.960
Oh, I think it's Phobos.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.600
I think maybe Mimas.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.560
-Titan.
-Correct.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.320
-Yes!
- Next question.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.360
Ascorbic acid is a form of which vitamin?

18:45.720 --> 18:46.720
-C.
-Correct.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.520
-Yeah!
-Quite the one-woman team

18:48.600 --> 18:51.040
you've got there, guys. Next question.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.680
What is the name
of the highest mountain in Wales?

18:55.560 --> 18:57.120
Why do you have a kid again?

18:57.200 --> 18:59.080
Um... Long story.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.920
Come, sit. My office.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.120
So, tell me what the problem is.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.640
You've probably heard,
I'm playing Juliet in the school play.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.200
Uh, congratulations.

19:17.040 --> 19:21.400
Anyway, I thought it was a play about love
but apparently, it's all about sex.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.000
And now, the whole cast
seem to be thinking about sex

19:24.080 --> 19:25.840
every second of every day.

19:26.520 --> 19:29.280
So... you're not ready to have sex

19:29.360 --> 19:31.840
but you're feeling pressure
from your peers to keep up with them.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.960
I don't want to have sex.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.920
But sometimes I think I should just do it,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.640
so everyone'll shut up
and stop making me feel like a freak.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.440
Well, try not to think about
what other people are doing.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.000
Run your own race,
and when you meet the right person,

19:47.080 --> 19:49.000
I'm sure you'll be ready.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.640
You're worried these concerns
might affect your performance.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.000
I'm the best actor in this school.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.840
I'm basically Meryl Streep but young...

20:02.920 --> 20:04.000
and Scottish.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.320
I hope that helped and if you want
to talk some more about this,

20:33.400 --> 20:34.840
then I'll be here.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.840
Thanks for that.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.600
-Okay.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.880
Be there ASAP.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.360
Okay.

20:52.520 --> 20:53.400
Elsie.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.280
Oh, shit.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
Elsie?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.280
Elsie?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.400
Shit!

21:05.120 --> 21:06.200
Final question.

21:06.280 --> 21:10.640
Which country, with a land mass
of 9.6 million square kilometers,

21:10.720 --> 21:13.040
has just one time zone?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.520
-I think it's China.
-I think maybe--

21:17.600 --> 21:18.680
Russia?

21:18.760 --> 21:20.480
- Incorrect.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.160
Let's Get Quizzy,
it's yours for the taking.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.840
Canada?

21:28.920 --> 21:31.360
Incorrect. The answer is China.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.920
-The Moordale Quiz Heads have won it...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.120
...by a hair with 68 points.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.680
Whoo!

21:50.840 --> 21:53.080
Congratulations.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.840
Miss Sands,

21:54.920 --> 21:56.360
we don't want Maeve on our team.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.600
She doesn't know how to collaborate
as a group and we nearly lost.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
But we won.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.360
Yeah, but we almost didn't, Maeve.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.440
Look, I need this for my school CV.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.400
Is this is how you feel too, Steve?

22:10.680 --> 22:11.680
Um...

22:12.760 --> 22:14.920
-Yeah.
-Nice.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.360
It's fine. I didn't want to be on
your stupid quiz team anyway.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.360
Maeve...

22:27.400 --> 22:29.560
Maeve.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.480
-Where's Elsie?
-I don't know.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.080
She was right here.
Then I sent a text, and she disappeared.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.000
-Are you joking?
-No, I told you I can't look after kids.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.440
Oh, sorry. Am I keeping you
from something really important?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.480
Go then, piss off.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.360
Maeve.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.680
-Maeve!
-I'm going to look for my sister

22:48.760 --> 22:49.960
that you lost.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.200
Okay.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.560
I'm coming, Maeve. I'm coming.

22:57.160 --> 23:01.000
Hey, let's be logical, Maeve.
Like, where's a three-year-old gonna go?

23:01.080 --> 23:04.160
Fuck being logical!
There's a child missing, she could be hurt

23:04.240 --> 23:06.240
-or someone could have taken her.
-Why are you yelling?

23:06.320 --> 23:08.400
Because everyone always lets me down.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.320
Sorry.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.960
Go, go, go, go!

23:20.040 --> 23:21.000
Elsie, no!

23:24.000 --> 23:25.440
Give it here. Jesus Christ.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.040
Oh.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.480
Right.

23:29.920 --> 23:34.400
-Told you she's a dickhead.
-Yeah, she's kinda cute, though.

23:37.960 --> 23:38.840
Uh...

23:39.280 --> 23:40.160
Um...

23:40.720 --> 23:43.520
Did you guys...
Did you make it through the heat?

23:44.800 --> 23:46.880
Yep... but I got kicked out.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.760
'Cause I mess everything up.

23:50.360 --> 23:51.880
You don't mess everything up.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.720
Anyway, that's their loss.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.880
I've gotta go. I'm seeing Ola and...

24:01.320 --> 24:04.480
I am really sorry
about losing Elsie. There's...

24:06.240 --> 24:08.200
Yeah, you're a really shit babysitter.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.160
Yeah.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.720
-I'll see you around.
-Yeah.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.800
I messed it up with you.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.080
What?

24:29.960 --> 24:33.280
There was this moment last term,
where I thought maybe you liked me...

24:35.000 --> 24:36.360
and I liked you back.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.840
Um, and I got scared,
so I didn't tell you how I felt.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.040
And then you met Ola.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.640
It's really hard seeing you
with her every day.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.120
Why are you telling me this now?

25:03.120 --> 25:04.120
Because it's true.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.040
Why do you look angry?

25:10.760 --> 25:12.760
Because, Maeve, you can't...

25:12.840 --> 25:14.120
That's not fair.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.560
I liked you. I really liked you.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.720
I fucking turned myself inside out
liking you.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.640
-You did like me?
-Yes.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.120
Of course I did.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.560
-And now you're saying you felt the same.
-Yeah, it's... I was confused.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.120
I have a girlfriend. I...

25:30.960 --> 25:32.680
I made myself get over you, Maeve,

25:32.760 --> 25:35.720
and now everything's fine,
everything's normal, everything's great.

25:38.840 --> 25:39.880
I've gotta go.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.360
Bad.

25:48.080 --> 25:48.920
Yeah,

25:50.440 --> 25:51.400
that was bad.

25:56.760 --> 26:00.200
It was not 14 times.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.200
Over the course of two years
postgrad together,

26:03.280 --> 26:06.600
I had to ask her out 14 times.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.240
And she was wildly untameable.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.800
-Yes, I was.
-She still is.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.640
Hmm.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.760
So, um, how did you two meet?

26:18.840 --> 26:21.360
Jakob did some work on my house.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.720
Oh, so... so you're an architect?

26:24.800 --> 26:25.720
I'm a plumber.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.440
Right, right. Well, honorable work,
yeah, yeah.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.920
Jakob has his own company.

26:32.000 --> 26:32.840
Oh?

26:35.760 --> 26:36.800
You know what?

26:38.160 --> 26:41.160
-I think I'm going to go home.
- No, don't leave.

26:41.240 --> 26:44.240
I have an early morning.
Lots of toilets to fix.

26:44.880 --> 26:48.720
-Yeah.
-It's early. We haven't eaten yet.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.000
I'll eat at home.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.560
Leave you guys some space
to catch up about Otis.

26:53.640 --> 26:58.040
-Nice to meet you.
-And you too, Jack... Jakob.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.320
Catch you later.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.520
-What?

27:14.960 --> 27:17.040
Your smugness is palpable.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.760
Look, he seems very nice.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.360
A practical man with big hands.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.760
I'm content.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.160
Yes, yes.

27:26.240 --> 27:30.560
I can see that
and I am very happy for you.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.960
You're always so suspicious.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.800
I-I am not here to disrupt your life.
I just want to spend

27:40.880 --> 27:44.280
a little bit of time with our boy.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.000
Our "boy" is almost a man, Remi.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.720
-Lovely, look at that. Yeah.
-No.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.480
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Oh, go on. Just a tickle.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.400
-No.
-For old time's sake.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.640
A little bit, just a little bit.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.600
-Mm. Okay.
-Uh-huh.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.440
Mm.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.640
Oh, no, I gotta get this button.
Can you see it?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.720
Yeah, I can. Wait, stay still.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.200
Oh, jeez.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.680
Fucking...

28:21.760 --> 28:23.360
-Oh, jeez.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.480
-I've got this.
-Okay?

28:40.560 --> 28:42.720
Yeah, I'm fine. How does this work?

28:43.240 --> 28:46.880
Is it... Sorry. This is... tricky.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.520
Fuck.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.920
Why? Why isn't that working?

28:51.840 --> 28:52.760
Oh...

28:53.160 --> 28:55.000
-Are you sure you're okay?

28:55.760 --> 28:56.720
You seem a bit off.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.320
I mean, is it hot in here?
Maybe it's the candles.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.120
That was supposed to be romantic.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.720
Hey, no, it's... I like them.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.360
I'm just...

29:08.920 --> 29:12.280
-hot.
-Well, maybe this doesn't feel right.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.920
We don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.280
Hey, I do.

29:46.720 --> 29:47.840
Sorry. Sorry.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.880
-Are you kidding me?
-Sorry.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.000
Who was it from?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.120
My mum.

29:56.000 --> 29:56.960
Ola, please, no.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.600
"I'm sorry. I feel like an idiot."

30:01.280 --> 30:02.720
It's clinic stuff.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.960
Is there something going on
between you and Maeve?

30:09.480 --> 30:12.600
Yeah. No! There's not. I just...

30:12.680 --> 30:14.440
It... We are friends.

30:14.520 --> 30:15.600
We're just friends.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.680
I don't think I want to do this tonight.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.000
-Just go.
-Okay.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.040
-I'm sorry.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.760
- I got the job.
-Where have you been?

30:55.520 --> 30:58.000
I picked up some things for the house
on the way home.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.120
You said you were going to be home
two hours ago.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.840
I went to an NA meeting as well.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.840
-Great, why didn't you say that before?
-I wasn't aware I was under investigation.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.640
I tried to do a nice thing
and you throw it in my face.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.640
How do you think that makes me feel?

31:11.720 --> 31:13.800
I don't really care how it makes you feel,
to be honest.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.960
If you say you'll be home
at a certain time, just be here.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.680
It's not my job to look after your kid.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.360
How long are you going to punish me for...

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
I'm here, aren't I?

31:22.320 --> 31:25.160
Yeah... but I'm just waiting
for you to flake on me again.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.520
I don't mind being on my own.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.160
Okay? I can look after myself.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.600
I don't want to look after you too.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.520
-You won't have to this time.
- Yeah, whatever.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.160
You make them like I used to,
with the faces.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.000
Help yourself.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.200
I was supposed to read that in school.
I never did.

32:06.080 --> 32:06.920
Why?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.480
I was probably in the back
of some boy's car,

32:09.560 --> 32:11.240
or smoking in a bush.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.240
-Maybe I should give it another go.
-Maybe you should.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.400
Don't put your boots on the sofa.

32:30.960 --> 32:34.160
- <i>This is really something.</i>
- <i>Just a few notes that I'm making.</i>

32:34.240 --> 32:36.600
No, Jean. This should be a book.

32:37.640 --> 32:41.920
Exposing what teenagers get up to
behind closed doors.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.040
Yeah, it could be revolutionary.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.440
Well...

32:46.360 --> 32:51.760
You always came up with
the most original ideas.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.000
-Who are you?
-Yes.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.400
-Wait, say that again.
-Original ideas.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.440
You just never had any...

33:00.800 --> 33:01.840
self-belief.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.360
Oh, my self-belief was just fine,
thank you very much.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.240
You've changed.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.480
And you... are still...

33:12.200 --> 33:14.080
an entitled prick.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
Shit! That's Otis. Shit!

33:39.240 --> 33:40.080
Hey.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.680
-Dad. Um...
-Come here.

33:42.760 --> 33:44.800
Wait, what? When did you get here?

33:44.880 --> 33:47.160
-Flew in this morning.
-Cool.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.240
Are you... Have you got, like, a tour?

33:49.320 --> 33:50.520
No, I've come to see you.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.800
I thought we could hang out together,
do some father-son bonding.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.800
Yeah, cool.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.800
Are you taller?

33:57.320 --> 33:58.280
Ah...

34:00.960 --> 34:02.440

35:20.240 --> 35:21.200
Mm-hmm.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.760
I thought we could spend
some time together tonight.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.480
Maybe we could even...

35:28.160 --> 35:29.000
Or...

35:30.320 --> 35:32.480
-we could just hug for a bit if...

35:33.080 --> 35:34.360
Come on, Maureen,

35:35.040 --> 35:36.200
we're not 23 anymore.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.960
You should probably take that off.

35:41.080 --> 35:45.600

Okay.

36:44.760 --> 36:45.880
This is how I die.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.480
Oi! What do you think you're doing?

37:25.560 --> 37:26.560
Look...

37:28.520 --> 37:30.880
- No!
- Help. Get off me!

37:31.840 --> 37:35.640
- Help!
-What in the name of God is going on?

37:35.720 --> 37:38.000
I was very cold, I asked him to help.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.560
I saw someone stealing your gas canister,
so I came over.

37:41.640 --> 37:45.640
I'm so sorry, Cynthia. I was just so cold.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.160
Oh, love, don't you dare apologize.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.480
There's a spare canister there,
you can have that.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.560
Help him, Jeffrey.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.200
And you... should be ashamed of yourself.

37:58.840 --> 37:59.800
Cheers, Jeff.

37:59.880 --> 38:00.720
Cheers, mate.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.360
Sucker.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.840
Uh...

38:36.440 --> 38:37.400
What is this place?

38:39.240 --> 38:41.520
-Do you want to see something cool?

39:05.360 --> 39:06.520
Thank you.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.080
Ah...

39:24.160 --> 39:25.000
Hang on.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.600
What was military school like?

40:37.200 --> 40:38.880
Well, I got kicked out, didn't I?

40:40.480 --> 40:42.960
But... better than being back home.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.360
Did you have to do
those serious drill things?

40:49.320 --> 40:50.200
Show me.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.560
I've forgotten it. No, I haven't. Here.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.480
Wow.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.600
I know you hate it at home, but...

41:30.680 --> 41:32.360
I'm kind of glad you're back.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.160
It's nearly morning. We should get going.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.560
I'm glad I'm back too.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.800
This was, um...

42:12.520 --> 42:13.720
strange.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.000
Okay.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.480
Bye.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.760
Bye.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.320
You're still here.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.280
-Oh, I've gotta go.
-Okay.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.360
Um...

42:51.120 --> 42:52.080
Cool.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.880
Hiding from your boyfriend?

43:29.720 --> 43:31.120
He's being such a dick.

43:41.440 --> 43:42.360
Eyelash.

43:43.040 --> 43:43.880
Make a wish.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.400
You can talk to me
about anything, you know.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.200
Even if you just want to be distracted.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.120
I could speak Gamma Velorum to you.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.000
That meant, "I made you something."

44:04.720 --> 44:05.640
Oh.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.360
Oh, my goodness.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.160
This is so cool.

44:13.240 --> 44:14.840
Thank you.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.680
I mean, there's no real secret to it,
it's just practice and practice.

44:33.680 --> 44:37.760
Hey, Bev. You've got a little something
on your face there.

44:38.280 --> 44:39.360
Thanks.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.720
It's avocado. I like it on toast.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.600
Anyway, the real secret is,
you've gotta know...

45:00.360 --> 45:02.040
...I know,
definitely don't do that.

45:02.120 --> 45:03.680
People pee in the sea all the time.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.200
- Jackson.
- I mean...

45:05.280 --> 45:06.600
Psst... Jackson...

45:08.680 --> 45:09.800
Two secs.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.920
-You all right?
-I'll teach you

45:14.000 --> 45:15.800
-how to deliver a soliloquy...
-Oh.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.520
...if you teach me how
to get jiggy with Dex.

45:19.520 --> 45:22.040
-Did you just say "get jiggy"?
-It sounded better in my head.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.360
Just... Just help me make him my, um...

45:27.880 --> 45:29.240
-Boyfriend?
-Yes.

45:30.320 --> 45:31.680
-All right, deal.
-Deal.

45:35.240 --> 45:38.000
I told you, he'll have sex with anyone.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.440
You better be quick, Flo.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.160
I don't wanna have sex.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.480
Okay.

45:50.280 --> 45:51.760
Do you want to have a seat?

45:53.920 --> 45:56.200
Not having sex is a valid choice.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.280
-And you shouldn't have sex unless you--
-No.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.840
I don't want to have sex at all.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.200
Ever, with anyone.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.880
I think I might be broken.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.160
Okay.

46:09.520 --> 46:12.920
Why don't you start
by telling me how you feel

46:13.000 --> 46:14.520
when you think about having sex?

46:18.240 --> 46:20.920
I don't feel anything.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.560
I have no connection to it.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.720
It's sort of like...

46:26.120 --> 46:30.520
I'm surrounded by a huge feast with
everything I could want to eat, but...

46:31.880 --> 46:32.720
I'm not hungry.

46:33.840 --> 46:34.720
Mmm.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.560
Do you know what asexuality is?

46:38.920 --> 46:41.880
It's when someone
has no sexual attraction

46:41.960 --> 46:43.720
to any sex or gender.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.000
Sex just...

46:46.960 --> 46:48.480
doesn't do it for some people.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.880
Oh. But I still want to fall in love.

46:52.360 --> 46:57.400
Well, some asexual people
still want romantic relationships

46:57.480 --> 46:59.200
but they don't want the sex bit.

46:59.800 --> 47:02.240
And others don't want either.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.680
You know, sexuality is fluid.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.840
Sex doesn't make us whole.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.480
And so,

47:11.920 --> 47:13.960
how could you ever be broken?

47:16.200 --> 47:18.040
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.120
She is so much better than sex kid.

47:26.960 --> 47:30.040
-Hey, how are you feeling?
-Amazing.

47:30.120 --> 47:33.560
Yeah, your advice was a bit crap
but your mum is my hero,

47:33.640 --> 47:35.240
so I need a refund.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.360
Uh...

47:46.680 --> 47:48.040
-Hey.
-Hi.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.400
Um...

47:51.040 --> 47:53.680
I'm really sorry about last night.
That was--

47:53.760 --> 47:57.080
Look, I've decided that I don't want you
to see Maeve anymore.

47:58.640 --> 48:00.240
If you want to be my boyfriend,

48:00.760 --> 48:03.760
then you have to talk to her and tell her
that you can't be friends with her.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.760
Um... Wait.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.040
Hey.

48:12.760 --> 48:13.680
Hey.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.880
Um, I've got, um, music.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.560
I've been missing you.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.800
-But I only saw you yesterday.
-Yeah.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.760
But it felt so long.

48:29.160 --> 48:30.400
Yeah, and I missed you too.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.840
I was...

48:34.440 --> 48:37.960
thinking that maybe
you want to be my boyfriend.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.320
Um...

48:44.200 --> 48:45.040
Uh...

48:45.120 --> 48:46.400
No pressure, okay?

48:47.280 --> 48:48.200
You think about it.
