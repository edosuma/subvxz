34:05.493 --> 34:06.859
I'm inviting you now.

34:06.894 --> 34:08.760
I want you to meet Cain
and get to know him.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.630
Do you like him?

34:10.664 --> 34:13.099
He's impressive by any measure.
So far, I like him very much.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.802
I just... I want him beside me
as your advocate.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.831
I need an advocate?

34:22.911 --> 34:24.376
Yes.

34:24.411 --> 34:26.143
Because I don't bill enough.

34:26.181 --> 34:28.146
If... It doesn't matter
what the reason is.

34:28.181 --> 34:30.884
I know your value as a doctor
and as a friend.

34:30.918 --> 34:32.552
And your place at Chastain
will always be secure

34:32.585 --> 34:34.186
as long as I'm CEO.

34:34.222 --> 34:37.016
I would just like you to have
this man as an ally.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.163
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

34:50.704 --> 34:53.847
Looking very distinguished
with your cane.

34:53.882 --> 34:54.898
(CHUCKLES)

34:54.922 --> 34:56.208
Thank you.

34:56.244 --> 34:58.577
Small consolation on a rough day.

34:58.612 --> 35:01.414
What did Annie's pathology report say?

35:02.449 --> 35:03.815
It's melanoma.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.650
(SIGHS)

35:05.686 --> 35:08.297
Which means Annie probably
has Stage IV cancer.

35:08.333 --> 35:10.356
God, I'm so sorry.

35:10.391 --> 35:13.719
Not exactly one for the win column.

35:14.295 --> 35:15.686
Cain already broke the news

35:15.722 --> 35:17.996
that she has a terminal diagnosis.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.300
I'll at least give the guy
credit for doing that.

35:21.635 --> 35:22.902
Annie.

35:25.239 --> 35:26.393
Mm-hmm.

35:26.429 --> 35:28.947
It is so good to see you.

35:28.983 --> 35:31.043
This is Nic Nevin. She's been with me,

35:31.079 --> 35:33.278
following your case throughout the day.

35:33.315 --> 35:35.114
I just wanted to say thank you so much

35:35.150 --> 35:36.961
for everything you did during the fire.

35:36.998 --> 35:39.643
Oh, it's nothing that you
wouldn't have done in my place.

35:39.643 --> 35:41.853
Is there anything that we can do for you?

35:41.889 --> 35:44.443
How are your spirits?
That's what we want to know.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.226
It's crazy, but my spirits
are really good.

35:47.262 --> 35:49.262
You know, after talking to Dr. Cain,

35:49.297 --> 35:52.565
I feel like the luckiest
unlucky person ever.

35:52.599 --> 35:54.766
- What did he say?
- Well, he said if I hadn't

35:54.802 --> 35:56.936
have been in the basement
and gotten injured,

35:56.971 --> 36:00.572
it's possible they might not
have caught my cancer in time.

36:02.177 --> 36:05.811
What did Dr. Cain say about what's ahead?

36:06.481 --> 36:09.215
Well, if this was a few years ago,

36:09.250 --> 36:11.951
he would've been arranging hospice care.

36:11.985 --> 36:15.320
But today, with all the drugs
for melanoma,

36:15.356 --> 36:17.623
I could be around for decades to come.

36:17.659 --> 36:20.927
That's true. Immunotherapy has
had great success with melanoma,

36:20.961 --> 36:22.494
and they're always coming out
with new things.

36:22.530 --> 36:25.465
And Dr. Cain said
I just need to be positive.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.000
- Fight through it, right?
- Right.

36:28.036 --> 36:30.268
I don't want to think about death

36:30.304 --> 36:32.340
any more than I already have.

36:34.141 --> 36:37.094
Conrad told me you lost your son.

36:37.512 --> 36:38.677
I'm very sorry.

36:38.713 --> 36:40.813
Yeah.

36:41.815 --> 36:43.815
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

36:45.987 --> 36:47.820
That's when I stopped racing.

36:48.356 --> 36:51.067
I see it was a big mistake now.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.659
Y-You can't stop living your life

36:53.695 --> 36:57.096
just 'cause someone you love
has lost theirs.

36:57.130 --> 36:59.576
You got to remember the good times.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.802
Get rid of the bad times and go on.

37:03.838 --> 37:05.804
I'm gonna compete again real soon.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.306
I'm just gonna fight to get well

37:08.342 --> 37:10.643
and fight through the chemo.

37:10.677 --> 37:12.844
And you know who's gonna be
with me right through it?

37:13.380 --> 37:14.880
My son.

37:16.384 --> 37:18.384
Because, you see, he...

37:18.418 --> 37:21.052
he never really left me.

37:21.088 --> 37:24.123
He just came to live here,

37:24.157 --> 37:26.018
in my heart.

You're kidding.

I'm glad to finally meet you.

38:19.452 --> 38:21.152
What you pulled off... saving a child

38:21.186 --> 38:22.920
who suffered an internal decapitation...

38:22.956 --> 38:25.956
- that was miraculous.

- Absolutely.

38:39.706 --> 38:41.371
Pleasure.

38:45.311 --> 38:46.710
Why'd you do that?

38:46.746 --> 38:50.119
W-What is the point
of alienating the man?

38:50.153 --> 38:52.889
What is the point of making nice
when I know who he is?

38:52.925 --> 38:54.885
I am still trying to wrap my head

38:54.920 --> 38:56.521
around the fact that you hired someone

38:56.556 --> 38:58.556
who so obviously has an ego
the size of Texas.

38:58.590 --> 39:00.358
I... Red Rock Mountain Medical hired him,

39:00.393 --> 39:02.126
and I understand why they did.

like Cain. It's everywhere.

39:09.034 --> 39:11.001
And doctors like me,
who put our patients first,

39:11.036 --> 39:12.570
- are collateral damage.
- No.

39:12.605 --> 39:14.862
I'll start interviewing
elsewhere immediately.

39:14.898 --> 39:17.809
- No. K-Kit. Please, don't. Don't.
- I'm sorry.

39:17.844 --> 39:20.110
But I don't belong here.

39:28.054 --> 39:29.818
