<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"... </i>

00:01.653 --> 00:02.833
Best thing to do is just get back

00:02.834 --> 00:04.067
- to business as usual.
- I was wondering if...

00:04.101 --> 00:06.666
You would fire me from the car wash?

00:06.689 --> 00:08.724
- Come again?
- I think I want to be a DJ.

00:08.759 --> 00:09.825
Who at Carlton is...

00:09.860 --> 00:11.661
- overseeing the interviews?
- Ms. Summers.

00:11.695 --> 00:13.896
I'm gonna be your
interpreter for the interview.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.831
Leo, do you know what an open adoption is?

00:15.866 --> 00:17.433
<i>Angelo: I think Abby will be better off</i>

00:17.467 --> 00:18.434
with all of us in her life.

00:18.468 --> 00:20.536
She's gonna have three dads.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.638
After you found out that
Emmett cheated on you,

00:22.673 --> 00:23.806
was there anything he could say

00:23.840 --> 00:24.807
to make you feel better?

00:24.841 --> 00:26.909
No.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.679
- She pulled a gun.
- So you nearly shot our daughter?!

00:29.713 --> 00:31.580
I thought she was an intruder.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.749
This East Riverside project has to stop!

00:33.784 --> 00:36.686
<i>Daphne: So if he was really angry</i>

00:36.720 --> 00:39.488
- right before the accident?
- That could have caused it.

00:39.523 --> 00:41.657
Angelo... he's brain dead.

00:41.692 --> 00:45.828
- Are you okay?
- This is all your fault!

You hungry?

00:56.873 --> 00:58.874
Um, there's still so much food.

00:58.909 --> 01:01.444
Or if you're sick of leftovers,

01:01.478 --> 01:02.545
I can cook you something.

01:02.579 --> 01:04.846
Opening a can of soup isn't cooking.

01:04.881 --> 01:07.516
You want me to read anything?

01:07.551 --> 01:09.518
I mean, how's the essay coming?

01:09.553 --> 01:12.421
(Scoffs) It's fine.

01:14.725 --> 01:16.559
I'm gonna go to Kathryn's kitchen.

01:16.593 --> 01:17.893
The light's better over there.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.598
(Sighs) Okay.

01:22.632 --> 01:24.633
John: But I'm not on the account.

01:24.668 --> 01:25.868
Did you get more snacks?

01:25.902 --> 01:29.805
Yeah, just in case the kids
get their appetites back.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.574
Hmm. What?

01:31.608 --> 01:33.709
No, he cannot do that.

01:33.744 --> 01:35.511
<i>"Why?" Well, let me explain it again.</i>

01:35.545 --> 01:37.546
Because he is dead.

01:37.581 --> 01:39.515
- Honey!
- What?

01:39.549 --> 01:41.550
<i>Oh, let me call you right back.</i>

01:41.585 --> 01:43.486
Bay, I am so sorry, sweetie.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.587
It's okay.

01:46.490 --> 01:48.858
Hey.

01:48.892 --> 01:50.493
Do you guys want something to eat?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.727
I just went to the store.

01:51.762 --> 01:52.928
How come whenever someone dies,

01:52.963 --> 01:54.697
everyone tries to feed you?

01:54.731 --> 01:56.499
Okay, look, it's been two weeks

01:56.533 --> 01:58.634
and I know it's been hard,

01:58.668 --> 02:01.737
but I think we've all
gotta get out of the house.

02:01.772 --> 02:03.439
<i>You know?</i>

02:03.473 --> 02:06.675
Bay, who's that from?

02:06.710 --> 02:09.512
Uh, Angelo's mom.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.447
My grandmother.

02:11.481 --> 02:13.682
Oh, poor thing.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.585
She's saying I have a cousin

02:16.620 --> 02:19.555
or a second cousin, I'm
guessing, in Chicago.

02:19.589 --> 02:24.627
He and Angelo lived
together a few years ago.

02:24.661 --> 02:26.595
Well, that's nice to know.

02:26.630 --> 02:28.697
She doesn't know

02:28.732 --> 02:30.866
how to use the Internet.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.536
<i>So she's asking if I could</i>

02:33.570 --> 02:37.873
find him and tell him what happened.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.809
(Sighs)

02:39.843 --> 02:42.912
Great. Let's go meet him.

02:42.946 --> 02:45.848
- (Scoffs)
- That's a great idea.

02:45.882 --> 02:48.651
Yes! I have got all of
these miles in my account.

02:48.685 --> 02:51.654
And, Daphne, you could visit Northwestern.

02:51.688 --> 02:53.656
That was one of your
pre-med choices, right?

02:53.690 --> 02:54.890
Okay, let's just hold on.

02:54.925 --> 02:58.460
No no no, we make a weekend out of it.

02:58.495 --> 03:00.596
I'm not really in the mood for a trip.

03:00.630 --> 03:01.864
Me neither.

03:01.898 --> 03:03.632
<i>- (Sighs)
- Kathryn: We have to think</i>

03:03.667 --> 03:05.467
about what you're gonna do next year.

03:05.502 --> 03:07.403
Angelo would not want you

03:07.437 --> 03:09.572
to put your lives on hold forever.

03:11.575 --> 03:14.810
I don't want to show up
on some guy's doorstep.

03:14.845 --> 03:19.648
You know, when my dad died,

03:19.683 --> 03:21.851
I felt this huge loss,

03:21.885 --> 03:25.421
but not just for him,

03:25.455 --> 03:28.424
but for all the things I didn't ask him.

03:29.826 --> 03:33.495
One day you're gonna be curious

03:33.530 --> 03:35.764
about Angelo's family.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.434
And it would be nice

03:38.468 --> 03:39.735
to make this connection now.

03:42.672 --> 03:44.740
<i>John: Your mom is right.</i>

03:44.774 --> 03:47.676
I'm gonna go book a flight.

03:47.711 --> 03:49.612
I'll set up the tour.

03:53.850 --> 03:55.684

Sorry we're gonna miss
your first D.J. gig tonight.

04:10.867 --> 04:14.570
It feels to just... carry on.

04:14.604 --> 04:17.572
You should do it. Don't feel bad.

04:17.607 --> 04:20.875
Well, if I can get 20 people to show up,

04:20.911 --> 04:22.678
then it might become a regular gig.

04:22.712 --> 04:24.880
So you guys can catch it next time.

04:27.651 --> 04:28.617
<i>John: I think it's very sweet</i>

04:28.652 --> 04:30.753
that you're hanging back with Regina.

04:30.787 --> 04:32.755
I don't think she should
be alone right now.

04:32.789 --> 04:33.756
Uh-huh.

04:33.790 --> 04:34.790
Hey, you guys,

04:34.824 --> 04:35.824
a few snacks for the plane.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.495
I'm gonna get some water.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.796
Hey, Tob.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.798
This gig, it's great.

04:42.832 --> 04:43.866
Does it pay?

04:43.900 --> 04:46.802
Creative-fulfillment-wise, yes.

04:46.836 --> 04:48.837
Cash money, not so much.

04:50.674 --> 04:53.609
I'm gonna go text every
person I've ever known.

04:53.643 --> 04:55.477
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

04:55.512 --> 04:56.578
See you guys.

04:57.681 --> 04:59.481
Yeah.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.552
Hey, uh, you sure you don't want to come?

05:03.586 --> 05:05.521
Ah, I'm sure.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.524
But I'm excited for you to meet Sebastian.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.700

05:17.734 --> 05:20.402

05:20.437 --> 05:22.604
Sweetie, did you remember
your motion sickness pills?

05:22.639 --> 05:24.440
(Curtly) Yeah.

- Bye, have fun.

<i>- (Ignition starts)

05:46.830 --> 05:48.430
So how you feeling? You want to go

05:48.465 --> 05:50.566
to the farmer's market? Get some oranges?

05:50.600 --> 05:51.867
Oh, no thanks.

05:51.901 --> 05:53.635
How about a movie?

05:54.731 --> 05:55.831
I kinda just

05:55.865 --> 05:57.566
want to be alone.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.734
Is that okay?

05:58.768 --> 06:00.769
Of course.

06:00.804 --> 06:02.738

Hi, I'm Lily.

06:18.922 --> 06:20.789
I live above you, directly.

06:20.824 --> 06:22.825
Do you think you might turn the noise down?

06:22.859 --> 06:24.560
I wouldn't call it noise.

06:24.594 --> 06:26.762
Uh, technically it's
electronic dance music.

06:27.797 --> 06:29.765
This is my only morning to lie in,

06:29.799 --> 06:32.534
and I'm very friendly
with the property manager.

06:32.569 --> 06:34.837
I'd rather not call him about this.

06:34.871 --> 06:37.573
Totally, it's just tonight's my first gig

06:37.607 --> 06:38.907
and so I'm trying to
work out all the kinks.

06:38.942 --> 06:42.711
Totally, but I've been
here for three weeks now

06:42.745 --> 06:44.480
and it's been very peaceful.

06:44.514 --> 06:47.583
And all of a sudden, there's
earthquakes and horns.

06:47.617 --> 06:49.952
Oh, well, first, I don't work with horns.

06:49.986 --> 06:52.788
So that was probably
like a car or something.

06:52.822 --> 06:54.523
And second, um...

06:54.557 --> 06:56.725
I've actually been in Iceland.

06:56.759 --> 06:58.803
Well, that's so lovely for you,

06:58.838 --> 07:00.872
but I suggest you turn the sound down.

07:00.906 --> 07:02.841
Or I'll try out my new club boots

07:02.875 --> 07:04.509
when you're sleeping.

07:05.544 --> 07:06.644
I'll make you a deal.

07:07.713 --> 07:08.880
<i>(Music stops)</i>

07:08.914 --> 07:11.816
If you come to my gig tonight at scratch,

07:11.851 --> 07:13.785
bring five friends, I promise

07:13.819 --> 07:15.420
no more music before noon.

07:15.454 --> 07:17.622
Really? You're that desperate for friends?

07:17.656 --> 07:19.424
Tonight, yes I am.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.725
Well, anyway, I'm busy.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.528
Please keep the noise down.

07:28.801 --> 07:30.769
Wh... Leo!

Hi.

07:31.904 --> 07:33.872
- Hi, honey.
- Oh.

07:35.508 --> 07:37.475
Hi, sweetheart. Come in, come in.

07:37.510 --> 07:38.543
Leo: Thank you.

07:38.577 --> 07:39.744
How was the drive?

07:39.779 --> 07:41.846
Oh, well, you know, a three-hour drive

07:41.881 --> 07:44.449
becomes a six-hour drive
with a one-year-old,

07:44.483 --> 07:45.517
but... (Chuckles)

07:46.552 --> 07:47.652
Oh.

07:48.954 --> 07:50.822
You forgot we were coming, didn't you?

07:50.856 --> 07:52.657
(Sighs)

07:54.794 --> 07:55.827
Now I remember.

07:55.861 --> 07:57.562
Of course you forgot.

07:57.596 --> 07:58.930
You got a million things on your mind.

07:58.964 --> 08:00.665
Look, it is no problem at all.

08:00.699 --> 08:01.800
Let's do this another time.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.502
Wait, you can't drive another six hours

08:04.537 --> 08:06.471
- with her right now.
- It's okay.

08:06.505 --> 08:07.605

- Hi.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.710
I saw you pull in.

08:12.745 --> 08:14.746
I didn't know you were coming this weekend.

08:14.780 --> 08:17.415
Oh, well, I should've reminded her.

08:17.450 --> 08:19.451
Um, but it is no big deal.

08:19.485 --> 08:21.553
We'll come another time.

08:21.587 --> 08:22.720
(Mouths)

08:22.755 --> 08:25.423
Uh, Leo, why don't you come over

08:25.458 --> 08:26.491
and hang out with me?

08:26.525 --> 08:28.426
No, really, you don't have to.

08:28.461 --> 08:30.628
Please, I'd love to
spend some time with Abby.

08:30.663 --> 08:33.431
Um, okay.

08:33.466 --> 08:34.631
Can I just change her real fast?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.701
Yeah, my room. Down to the left.

08:39.905 --> 08:41.573
Thank you.

I...

08:43.642 --> 08:45.510
I really...

08:45.544 --> 08:47.679
I think I should get to a meeting.

08:47.713 --> 08:50.448
Yeah, absolutely. Go, honey.

08:56.956 --> 08:59.657
Man: And that is our
beautiful campus, folks.

08:59.692 --> 09:00.859
Hey, fun fact.

09:00.893 --> 09:03.428
The school was actually
built on a landfill.

09:03.462 --> 09:04.429
That's right, ladies and gents.

09:04.463 --> 09:05.463
You are standing on a landfill right now.

09:05.498 --> 09:06.498
Um, but hey,

09:06.532 --> 09:08.389
let's not trash Northwestern, okay?

09:08.390 --> 09:09.610
(Laughter)

09:09.611 --> 09:12.770

- Guide: All right. That concludes our campus tour.

09:12.805 --> 09:14.572
Happy to take any questions.

09:14.607 --> 09:18.676
Uh, yeah, my daughter is
very interested in pre-med.

09:18.711 --> 09:19.844
Where are those buildings, please?

09:19.879 --> 09:21.513
They're on the north end of campus.

09:21.547 --> 09:22.780
<i>I'm actually pre-med as well,</i>

09:22.815 --> 09:25.583
so I could show her the bio
and chem labs if you want.

09:25.618 --> 09:26.885
I don't think...

09:26.919 --> 09:28.653
And there's a pre-med mixer later too.

09:28.687 --> 09:30.555
Well, that should be fun.

09:30.589 --> 09:32.557
Yeah, I think she'd love that.

_

09:34.928 --> 09:37.674

09:38.164 --> 09:39.531

_

09:41.834 --> 09:43.902
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, nice to meet you.

09:43.936 --> 09:46.528
<i>You two have fun. Stay
out as late as you want.</i>

09:46.622 --> 09:48.423

09:48.457 --> 09:49.557
Let's go meet your cousin.

09:49.592 --> 09:51.626
Yeah, let's do it.

09:57.766 --> 10:00.768
Uh, I think I should go in alone.

10:00.803 --> 10:01.836
Are you kidding me?

10:01.871 --> 10:02.837
We haven't met this guy yet.

10:02.872 --> 10:03.872
You just let your other daughter

10:03.906 --> 10:05.406
go off with a stranger.

10:05.441 --> 10:06.774
That kid's not getting anybody

10:06.809 --> 10:08.476
into any trouble, believe me.

10:08.511 --> 10:10.545
Okay, Sebastian's my family.

10:10.579 --> 10:12.447
And I'm meeting him for the first time.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.581
And I don't want him to think

10:13.616 --> 10:15.550
that I'm some little kid who needs her d...

10:15.584 --> 10:17.519
Okay, I get it. Keep your phone on.

10:17.553 --> 10:18.686
Call me if you need me.

10:18.721 --> 10:20.421
I'm grabbing coffee, right there.

10:20.456 --> 10:22.457
I'll be right there. Okay?

10:22.491 --> 10:23.725
Thank you.

10:44.680 --> 10:45.680
<i>Man: Can I help you?</i>

10:45.714 --> 10:48.550
Yes, uh, hi.

10:48.584 --> 10:50.618
Uh, this is a little weird,

10:50.653 --> 10:52.720
but I think you and I are...

10:52.755 --> 10:55.757
um, are you Sebastian Sorrento?

10:55.791 --> 10:57.725
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:57.760 --> 10:59.761
Great, uh, I'm Bay Kennish.

10:59.795 --> 11:01.396
I wrote to you on your website.

11:01.430 --> 11:02.630
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

11:02.665 --> 11:04.499
My grandmother, your great-aunt,

11:04.533 --> 11:06.568
wanted me to come and find you

11:06.602 --> 11:09.837
and tell you that something
happened in the family.

11:09.872 --> 11:11.439
<i>Go ahead.</i>

11:11.473 --> 11:12.740
Well...

11:12.775 --> 11:15.643
I'm here to tell you that, uh...

11:15.678 --> 11:18.580
Angelo is gone.

11:18.614 --> 11:20.848
He got in a car accident two weeks ago

11:20.883 --> 11:23.651
and... he died.

11:25.788 --> 11:27.555
<i>(Lock buzzing)</i>

11:29.758 --> 11:30.758
<i>(Door opens)</i>

11:33.843 --> 11:36.144
Angelo, the freaking
luckiest guy in the world.

11:36.179 --> 11:37.913
Everything always fell in his lap:

11:37.947 --> 11:40.916
Girls, jobs, everything.

11:42.252 --> 11:44.019
Bad luck catches up to you.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.058
Uh, so I thought maybe

11:50.093 --> 11:52.828
you could tell me about the
time that he was out here

11:52.862 --> 11:54.863
- living with you and...
- Not much to say.

11:54.898 --> 11:56.098
He crashed here for about six months,

11:56.132 --> 11:57.866
did a little modeling

11:57.901 --> 11:59.201
or building furniture for cougars.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.036
<i>I... I don't know.</i>

12:01.070 --> 12:02.871
Then he saw that article about you

12:02.906 --> 12:04.172
and ran off to sue some hospital.

12:04.207 --> 12:05.874
He won a buttload,

12:05.909 --> 12:08.010
and never heard from him again.

12:08.044 --> 12:09.011
That's about it.

12:09.045 --> 12:11.113
He actually came to meet me.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.848
The lawsuit was just something

12:12.882 --> 12:14.816
that was kinda happening already.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.120
Uh...

12:18.154 --> 12:19.221
So he modeled, huh?

12:19.255 --> 12:22.124
Um, I had never heard that, actually.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.092
Was it for like a store
or for like a magazine?

12:24.127 --> 12:25.894
I really don't know.

12:25.929 --> 12:28.130
Um...

12:28.164 --> 12:30.165
I really like your stuff.

12:30.199 --> 12:31.967
I'm an artist too.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.069
It's funny, I always thought
I got it from my mother's side.

12:34.103 --> 12:35.804
Regina. Did you know her?

12:35.838 --> 12:38.073
Look, I don't really know
what you want from me,

12:38.107 --> 12:39.942
but I got a church window
I got to finish by tomorrow.

12:39.976 --> 12:40.976
So...

12:42.111 --> 12:43.145
Right, I'm just gonna leave.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.047
I'm so sorry to have bothered you.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.886
Hey, you know what? I'm your cousin...

12:53.323 --> 12:55.824
- Oh my God.
- Are you all right?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.026
- Um, oh, I'm such a klutz.
- No, don't...

12:58.061 --> 13:00.028
I do stuff like this all the time.

13:00.063 --> 13:02.864
- Let me pay you back.
- No, don't worry about it.

13:02.899 --> 13:04.766
No, no, really. Just
tell me how much it is.

13:04.801 --> 13:05.934
It's fine, just leave it alone.

13:05.969 --> 13:07.235
No, really. Let me pay you back.

13:07.270 --> 13:09.204
- Please.
- Fine, 700.

13:09.238 --> 13:10.973
Dollars?

13:11.007 --> 13:12.808
It's one-of-a-kind.

13:12.842 --> 13:14.810
(Sharp inhale) I'm gonna come back

13:14.844 --> 13:16.211
- with money, obviously.
- It's okay.

13:16.245 --> 13:17.913
No no, I'm gonna come back.

13:17.947 --> 13:19.147
So, uh...

13:19.182 --> 13:20.916
See you soon. (Chuckles)

13:24.120 --> 13:26.054
(Baby voice) You're such a pretty girl.

13:26.089 --> 13:29.057
Ooh! I could just eat her up.

13:29.092 --> 13:31.259
(Chuckles) Aw, she likes you.

13:31.294 --> 13:33.095
You're lucky.

13:33.129 --> 13:35.964
You should enjoy this
time. It goes so fast.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.033
I know.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.836
Ugh, but sometimes all I
want is to be able to say,

13:40.870 --> 13:42.938
"honey, could you please do that yourself?"

13:42.972 --> 13:44.973
Victor doesn't help you out?

13:45.008 --> 13:46.975
Um...

13:47.010 --> 13:49.144
Victor and I...

13:49.178 --> 13:51.013
Oh no.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.881
It's actually been months.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.250
- Oh.
- I didn't want to say anything to Angelo.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.953
I mean, part of the reason
why he let us have her

13:57.987 --> 13:59.087
was that there were two of us.

13:59.122 --> 14:01.890
But the truth is I pushed
Victor into having a baby,

14:01.924 --> 14:04.960
and then he fought Angelo for her

14:04.994 --> 14:07.229
because that's the way he is.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.831
He likes a good fight.

14:09.866 --> 14:11.933
So you're doing this all by yourself?

14:11.968 --> 14:14.936
I haven't had a night off in months.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.973
Does she know?

14:18.007 --> 14:20.876
She thinks papa is on a trip.

14:20.910 --> 14:22.177
- Right, sweetheart?
- Oh.

14:22.211 --> 14:23.245
Papa's on a trip.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.180
Yeah.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.117
(Abby cries)

14:29.152 --> 14:31.019
The thing is, um...

14:32.055 --> 14:33.188
Now she's lost two dads.

14:35.058 --> 14:36.024
I got you.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.128
So this is it.

14:40.163 --> 14:43.131
Um... (Sniffs)

14:43.166 --> 14:45.233
<i>Oh, sorry about the smell.
It's the guy next door.</i>

14:45.268 --> 14:46.868
He's always getting stoned.

14:46.903 --> 14:48.970
(Sniffs)

14:49.005 --> 14:51.873
Are all those for pre-med?

14:51.908 --> 14:55.811
Yeah, embryology, anatomy III.

14:55.845 --> 14:57.012
It's like 2,000 pages

14:57.046 --> 14:58.914
of pre-reading for each class at least.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.116
Damn.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.218
So if you went here, how
would you keep up in class?

15:03.252 --> 15:06.021
I would use this service called "Cart."

15:06.055 --> 15:08.190
They caption everything
and take notes for you.

15:08.224 --> 15:10.892
(Laughing) Wow. Lucky.

15:12.095 --> 15:15.864
I'm sorry, that was... that was dumb.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.201
Do you ever wonder what's
the point in being a doctor

15:19.235 --> 15:21.837
when people are just gonna die anyway?

15:21.871 --> 15:23.972
Sometimes death is just inevitable.

at this mixer later?!

Well, fresh out of herb actually.

16:06.115 --> 16:08.984

16:09.018 --> 16:10.886
I can hook you guys up with some coke.

Cocaine? No, thanks.

19:43.444 --> 19:45.445
All right. (Chuckles)

19:47.549 --> 19:49.416
Okay, come on, Travis.

19:49.450 --> 19:50.651
Let's go find a table.

19:50.652 --> 19:52.352
_

19:53.788 --> 19:56.456
Whew! She finally went down.

19:56.524 --> 19:57.691
Oh, good.

19:57.725 --> 19:59.526
Oh, my gosh. I wish I could explain to her,

19:59.561 --> 20:02.362
"kid, when you grow up,

20:02.397 --> 20:04.364
you're gonna want to do nothing but sleep."

20:04.399 --> 20:06.466
(Chuckles) If only they listened to reason.

20:06.501 --> 20:08.335
- (Chuckles)
- Hey, are you hungry?

20:08.369 --> 20:09.636
Oh, I am starved.

20:09.671 --> 20:11.505
Ah, well, um...

20:11.539 --> 20:13.707
I had dinner plans with my friend Renzo

20:13.741 --> 20:15.576
and he might be here soon.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.344
Well, then I can make myself scarce.

20:17.378 --> 20:18.412
I'll go grab something if you don't mind

20:18.446 --> 20:20.480
- listening for Abby.
- Oh, no, no, no

20:20.515 --> 20:22.382
<i>- stay. It'll be fun.
- (Door opens)</i>

20:22.417 --> 20:23.684
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:23.718 --> 20:25.586
Surprise. I'm cooking.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.688
Oh.

20:27.722 --> 20:29.590
Hi, I'm Lorenzo.

20:29.624 --> 20:31.825
Red-zo. Renzo!

20:31.859 --> 20:33.594
I'm Renzo. I'm Kathryn's friend.

20:33.628 --> 20:35.395
(Chuckles) I'm Leo.

20:35.430 --> 20:38.498
I thought I would make us some tocino.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.367
It's a traditional pilipino dish.

20:40.401 --> 20:41.635
It's gonna take about an hour...

20:41.669 --> 20:43.837
maybe two hours, but it's
definitely worth the wait.

20:43.871 --> 20:46.373
Oh, then I'll make us some appetizers.

20:46.407 --> 20:47.441
No no! Don't you dare!

20:47.475 --> 20:49.409
I need you to be starved when it's ready.

20:49.444 --> 20:50.677
And you are not lifting a finger.

20:50.712 --> 20:52.713
- Oh, okay!
- That sounds delicious.

20:53.815 --> 20:55.382
Anyone want a drink?

20:55.416 --> 20:57.517
- Yes, please!
- Actually, I don't drink.

21:00.421 --> 21:01.655
(Sighs)

21:01.689 --> 21:05.626
And then I brushed it and it fell over.

21:05.660 --> 21:07.461
All right, but you're okay?

21:07.495 --> 21:10.330
I'm fine. I just feel like an idiot.

21:10.365 --> 21:11.698
Oh, come on, sweetie. He's your cousin.

21:11.733 --> 21:12.766
He's not gonna be that mad at you.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.735
Yeah, right. Totally nice guy.

21:14.769 --> 21:17.337
Uh...

21:17.372 --> 21:19.806
But the thing is I have to pay him for it

21:19.841 --> 21:22.809
and... it was really expensive.

21:22.844 --> 21:24.645
How expensive?

21:24.679 --> 21:26.580
$700.

21:26.614 --> 21:28.482
- Bay!
- I know, I know.

21:28.516 --> 21:30.784
But it was like this
one-of-a-kind vase thing.

21:30.818 --> 21:33.487
- Oh my God.
- I'm sorry.

21:33.521 --> 21:34.721
I'm so, so sorry.

21:36.391 --> 21:37.424
Can you write me a check?

21:37.492 --> 21:38.659
I am not an A.T.M.

21:38.693 --> 21:39.693
I'll pay you back.

21:39.727 --> 21:41.628
Okay, I will take care of this,

21:41.663 --> 21:42.729
but I'm coming with you.

21:42.764 --> 21:45.732
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

21:45.767 --> 21:47.834
- Uh... okay.
- Now.

21:47.869 --> 21:51.371
- (Sniffing)
- (Harsh breathing)

21:51.406 --> 21:53.440
I feel like I'm pulsing. Is that normal?

21:53.474 --> 21:54.441
Probably.

21:54.475 --> 21:55.842
(Sharp exhale)

21:55.877 --> 21:57.811
- Have you done this before?
- What? Coke?

21:57.845 --> 21:59.413
- Yeah.
- No.

21:59.447 --> 22:01.615
No no no no no no no, but this is good.

22:01.649 --> 22:04.384
<i>This is really good.</i>

22:04.419 --> 22:05.619
(Laughs)

22:05.653 --> 22:07.421
Oh.

22:07.455 --> 22:10.323
Are these your parents?

22:10.358 --> 22:12.359
Yeah, yeah, they're in China.

22:12.393 --> 22:13.560
I haven't seen them in three years.

22:13.594 --> 22:15.529
What?! They don't come visit?

22:15.563 --> 22:16.797
No, they've never been here.

22:16.831 --> 22:18.465
I came to the states for high school.

22:18.499 --> 22:21.368
Me and my brother lived in
an apartment that they got us.

22:21.402 --> 22:22.536
And this old lady who
was a friend of my aunt

22:22.570 --> 22:23.537
used to check in on us,

22:23.571 --> 22:25.338
but all we did was study and eat cereal.

22:25.373 --> 22:27.474
- Study and cereal.
- That is so sad.

22:27.508 --> 22:29.476
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

22:29.510 --> 22:30.677
Yeah, it kinda was.

22:30.712 --> 22:32.546
But as long as I keep getting a 4.0,

22:32.580 --> 22:33.580
I still keep getting checks.

22:33.614 --> 22:35.415
(Breathy moaning)

22:35.450 --> 22:37.617
(Laughs, exhales loudly)

22:37.652 --> 22:40.353
Oh! I feel weird.

22:40.388 --> 22:41.488
Me too.

22:41.522 --> 22:42.622
I don't know if I like this.

22:42.657 --> 22:44.558
I can't swallow. I need to swallow.

22:44.592 --> 22:47.494
I think my throat is swollen.

22:47.528 --> 22:49.730
You're okay. I promise.

22:49.764 --> 22:51.431
Just be cool.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
Okay.

22:53.634 --> 22:56.570
Man, this thing is... it's rough.

22:56.604 --> 22:58.605
You can't even like curl up on it.

22:58.639 --> 23:00.407
Why do you have it?

23:00.441 --> 23:02.309
I don't know. It came with the room.

23:02.343 --> 23:04.511
I didn't have a choice.
My choices are made for me.

23:07.582 --> 23:08.749
That is so wrong.

23:11.419 --> 23:13.353
I know, right?

23:14.422 --> 23:15.489
Selfie.

23:15.523 --> 23:17.324
To send to my brother.

23:17.358 --> 23:19.726
He'll never believe I
have a girl in my room.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.441
Are you okay?

23:37.812 --> 23:39.613
You should get rid of that couch.

23:39.647 --> 23:42.616
You should get rid of all the
things that you don't like.

23:42.650 --> 23:46.419
Just... a cleanse!

23:46.454 --> 23:47.687
You could push it out the window.

23:47.722 --> 23:49.556
The window's too small.

23:49.590 --> 23:51.424
Well, we could throw it off the roof!

23:51.459 --> 23:53.593
- (Laughs)
- Yeah. Yeah!

23:53.628 --> 23:55.595
This is gonna be fun!

23:55.630 --> 23:57.497
(Both laugh)

23:59.428 --> 24:00.528
I don't like heights.

24:00.562 --> 24:01.562
I just remembered that
I don't like heights.

24:01.597 --> 24:04.265
- One, two...
- Oh, you can't hear me.

24:04.299 --> 24:05.333
Three!

24:05.367 --> 24:06.567
<i>(Daphne screams)</i>

24:06.602 --> 24:08.302
(Screams)

24:08.337 --> 24:10.304
- What the hell?!
- (Hysterical laughing)

24:10.339 --> 24:12.440
- That was awesome!
- You could've killed us!

24:12.474 --> 24:14.242
Sorry. So sorry!

24:14.276 --> 24:16.310
That was so good. What
are we throwing next?

24:16.345 --> 24:17.545
What?! No!

24:19.381 --> 24:20.548
Hmm.

24:20.582 --> 24:24.218
So Renzo and I met at a tap class.

24:24.253 --> 24:25.653
- He's amazing.
- Oh, stop.

24:25.688 --> 24:28.556
- Do you dance?
- Not on purpose.

24:28.590 --> 24:30.191
And also not well.

24:32.594 --> 24:34.328
Kathy my dear, do you have

24:34.363 --> 24:36.330
a medium-ish pot with a lid?

24:36.365 --> 24:38.633
I think you've used all of them.

24:38.667 --> 24:40.301
No, I need it for the beans.

24:40.335 --> 24:42.303
- Oh, oh, no, go back, back I say.
- Oh!

24:42.337 --> 24:43.671
You are not to lift a finger,

24:43.706 --> 24:45.406
- Kathryn Kennish.
- (Sighs)

24:45.441 --> 24:47.675
- So do you like to cook?
- Not so much.

24:47.710 --> 24:49.377
One time I was so desperate,

24:49.411 --> 24:51.479
I actually ate her baby food for dinner.

24:51.513 --> 24:52.647
(Laughs loudly)

24:52.681 --> 24:54.282
I love to cook.

24:54.316 --> 24:55.416
Oh, I spilled the beans.

24:55.451 --> 24:57.418
Oh, oh, oh, please. Oh, can we just

24:57.453 --> 24:59.287
- please help you?
- No, no, no.

24:59.321 --> 25:02.623
I'm good. I should be finished
in a bit, just shortly.

25:02.658 --> 25:04.225
But it smells fantastic.

25:04.259 --> 25:06.227
- Yeah.
- Tada!

25:06.261 --> 25:07.628
Oh, well.

25:07.663 --> 25:09.430
It's my grandfather's secret ingredient.

25:09.465 --> 25:10.431
(Sighs)

25:10.466 --> 25:13.468
Maybe I'll put some music on?

25:13.502 --> 25:16.204
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's in the living room.

25:21.276 --> 25:24.245
Renzo... honey. Are you nervous?

25:24.279 --> 25:26.514
Me? Nervous? Do I seem nervous?

25:26.548 --> 25:28.382
I'm nervous.

25:28.417 --> 25:30.485
- Why?
- Oh, nothing.

25:30.519 --> 25:32.653
It's just that I haven't had
a real relationship in years.

25:32.688 --> 25:35.256
And that man is the epitome
of every single person

25:35.290 --> 25:36.424
I have ever lusted after.

25:36.458 --> 25:39.227
- Just that.
- Well, you're doing great.

25:39.261 --> 25:41.229
Just relax. Be yourself.

25:41.263 --> 25:43.264
What is that? I don't even remember?

25:43.298 --> 25:45.266
Oh God! It's hot!

25:45.300 --> 25:48.202
Is the heat on?!

26:31.480 --> 26:33.481
Women! Am I right?!

26:33.515 --> 26:35.416
You know they start off

26:35.450 --> 26:38.219
and they have this
beautiful, soft, smooth skin

26:38.253 --> 26:40.221
and they smell so nice.

26:40.255 --> 26:42.423

turn your back for a second

Oh, here, let me buy you a beer.

Yeah.

Ohh, you... right.

Well, here, man. You can have mine.

27:17.292 --> 27:18.626
Hi, how are you?

27:18.660 --> 27:20.628
I'm Miles.

27:20.662 --> 27:23.264
Your non-alcoholic beverage

27:23.298 --> 27:24.565
looks strangely like beer.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.201
(Chuckles) No, that's cool.

27:27.236 --> 27:28.369
No, actually it's not.

27:28.403 --> 27:30.471
But it is. Why? What are you,

27:30.505 --> 27:33.341
- like a school teacher?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.409
And Emmett's in high school.

27:35.444 --> 27:38.346
So how about I pretend I didn't see that

27:38.380 --> 27:41.482
and you swap it for a nice, cold seltzer?

27:50.359 --> 27:51.459
Emmett?

27:51.493 --> 27:53.494
You're Emmett?

28:12.314 --> 28:14.348
Just leave me alone! Okay, I'm fine!

28:14.383 --> 28:16.517
<i>- I'm fine.
- Man: All right, bro'.</i>

28:16.551 --> 28:17.518
Chill out.

28:20.622 --> 28:22.456
I'm fine.

28:22.491 --> 28:24.292
It's all good.

28:28.563 --> 28:30.464
(Fast tapping, laughs)

28:30.499 --> 28:32.633
Oh! How about this chair?

28:32.668 --> 28:35.169
I can feel my heart. It's really pounding.

28:35.203 --> 28:36.337
I think I'm having a heart attack.

28:36.371 --> 28:38.205
Okay, it's a little heavy.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.407
<i>- This lamp.
- No.</i>

28:39.441 --> 28:41.575
- I really need that for light.
- Oh! This!

- Oh no! No no no.
- It's old anyway.

28:43.512 --> 28:44.578
Your parents will just buy you another one.

throwing my computer...

- ... Off the roof.

28:47.449 --> 28:49.250
It'll be so liberating. Just live!

28:49.284 --> 28:51.285
- No!
- (Laughs)

28:51.320 --> 28:53.321
I really hate this. Why
did you make me do this?

28:53.355 --> 28:55.589
- Daphne!
- Being good all the time

28:55.624 --> 28:58.225
- gets you nowhere!
- Please.

28:58.260 --> 28:59.527
Can I just have it back?

28:59.561 --> 29:01.228
All my papers are on there

29:01.263 --> 29:02.296
and I haven't backed it up since yesterday.

29:02.331 --> 29:04.465
Just give it back to me, please.

29:14.409 --> 29:16.344
(Sighs)

29:16.378 --> 29:18.412
I want it to stop.

29:19.448 --> 29:21.449
<i>Please make it stop.</i>

29:21.483 --> 29:23.617
(Even breathing)

29:25.187 --> 29:26.454
I'm sorry.

29:34.463 --> 29:36.464
So to, uh...

29:36.498 --> 29:38.632
- Sebastian Sorrento, right?
- Yeah.

29:38.667 --> 29:41.202
Here you are.

29:41.236 --> 29:43.637
This is the piece, huh?

29:43.672 --> 29:45.239
Yeah.

29:45.273 --> 29:46.407
Wow.

29:47.509 --> 29:50.378
Again, I am so, so sorry.

29:50.412 --> 29:51.579
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

29:51.613 --> 29:53.214
You know what?

29:53.248 --> 29:55.182
You two do look alike, I got to say.

29:55.217 --> 29:57.251
And you have the whole art thing.

29:57.285 --> 29:58.552
I meant that's... (Clicks tongue)

29:58.587 --> 30:00.488
I think it's great you
made this connection.

30:00.522 --> 30:03.324
Well, we should get going.

30:03.358 --> 30:05.359
No, what are you talking about?

30:05.394 --> 30:06.560
We just got here. I'm looking at

30:06.595 --> 30:08.462
all of this amazing work.

30:08.497 --> 30:10.264
Well, that's all in progress.

30:10.298 --> 30:11.565
None of it's really ready yet.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.568
You're being modest. This
is really great stuff.

30:14.603 --> 30:17.338
I just... I have one question.

30:17.372 --> 30:22.410
Is everything in the studio for s...

30:26.314 --> 30:27.548
<i>John: Sebastian.</i>

30:29.618 --> 30:31.685
Those are... are different, actually.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.621
Actually, no.

30:33.655 --> 30:35.656
They're exactly the same

30:35.690 --> 30:40.361
as the one-of-a-kind piece
I just paid you $700 for.

30:40.395 --> 30:41.562
You lied to me?

30:41.596 --> 30:43.464
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Dad.

30:43.498 --> 30:45.366
No, Bay! I want an answer from you.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.401
Dad! Please.

30:47.436 --> 30:50.438
Just wait in the car. I
will talk to him, okay?

30:50.472 --> 30:52.273
<i>Please.</i>

30:52.307 --> 30:53.507
I want my check back.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.481
Bay, I will be outside...

31:00.515 --> 31:01.582
right outside.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.488
<i>- (Door opens)
- (Sighs)</i>

31:09.391 --> 31:10.458
<i>(Door closes)</i>

31:10.492 --> 31:12.593
I wasn't planning this.

31:12.627 --> 31:14.428
But you broke it and I figured

31:14.463 --> 31:16.297
Angelo owed me for all those months

31:16.331 --> 31:17.331
staying here rent-free.

31:17.365 --> 31:19.500
Hey, you know, I'm a Sorrento.

31:19.534 --> 31:21.435
When we see an opportunity, we go for it.

31:21.470 --> 31:23.637
I'm sure you know that from Angelo.

31:23.672 --> 31:25.239
Man, he was like the king of it.

31:25.273 --> 31:27.508
I am sick and tired of you trashing him.

31:27.542 --> 31:30.411
Look, I don't know what
you had against the guy.

31:30.445 --> 31:32.313
Okay, maybe he was better looking than you.

31:32.347 --> 31:33.581
Maybe he was smarter than you,

31:33.615 --> 31:35.216
maybe he had more friends. I don't get it,

31:35.250 --> 31:37.284
but he's gone!

31:37.319 --> 31:40.654
He had a freaking
aneurysm and now he's gone.

31:40.689 --> 31:42.556
W... wait.

31:42.591 --> 31:44.225
What do you mean he had an aneurysm?

31:44.259 --> 31:46.560
You said he got into a car accident.

31:46.595 --> 31:49.296
He had an aneurysm and then
he got into a car accident.

31:49.331 --> 31:50.698
Do you know about Francesca?

31:50.732 --> 31:52.666
Who's Francesca?

31:52.701 --> 31:54.702
Angelo's older sister.

31:54.736 --> 31:56.537
Hold... hold on.

31:58.373 --> 32:01.575
But are you sure? I didn't
even know he had a sister.

32:06.248 --> 32:07.281
That's her.

32:09.618 --> 32:13.487
<i>She was 18 when she
died of an aneurysm too.</i>

32:27.276 --> 32:28.643
So it's hereditary.

32:30.313 --> 32:32.247
I'm 18.

32:34.383 --> 32:35.717
That doesn't necessarily mean...

32:35.751 --> 32:37.652
That there's a ticking time bomb

32:37.687 --> 32:39.721
in my brain that could
go off at any moment?

32:42.458 --> 32:44.392
I don't really know what to say.

32:46.462 --> 32:49.731
I'm sorry this didn't go as you expected.

32:51.534 --> 32:53.468
<i>- Yeah, that's okay.
- (Phone vibrates)</i>

32:56.405 --> 32:58.406
My dad's waiting.

32:58.441 --> 33:00.675
No no no. Please, please.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.444
Keep it.

33:08.317 --> 33:10.418
So, um...

33:10.453 --> 33:12.687
You said this was a family recipe?

33:12.722 --> 33:16.224
Yes, my Lola would make it every summer.

33:16.259 --> 33:17.659
<i>- (Abby crying)
- Do you guys hear that?</i>

33:17.693 --> 33:19.694
Is there a tiny dog

33:19.729 --> 33:21.263
trapped somewhere in the house?

33:21.297 --> 33:23.498
<i>- (Crying)
- (Gasps)</i>

33:23.532 --> 33:24.699
I'm so sorry.

33:24.734 --> 33:26.368
I unplugged that thing in order to...

33:26.402 --> 33:28.270
Who knows how long she's been crying.

33:28.304 --> 33:29.337
You stay here. I'll take care of her.

33:29.372 --> 33:31.306
No, I just want to check on my daughter.

33:31.340 --> 33:33.441
<i>(Crying louder)</i>

33:33.476 --> 33:34.643
I am so sorry.

33:34.677 --> 33:36.678
When I meet somebody I'm
actually attracted to,

33:36.712 --> 33:38.246
I go completely insane.

33:38.281 --> 33:40.348
- You must hate me!
- No, I don't.

33:40.383 --> 33:41.549
Don't worry. It's nothing.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.518
I need to shower and cry.

33:43.552 --> 33:45.320
- I should go.
- No.

33:45.354 --> 33:46.454
You're not gonna drive

33:46.489 --> 33:48.390
after three glasses of
wine on an empty stomach.

33:48.424 --> 33:49.457
- I'll take you.
- No, maybe I should

33:49.492 --> 33:51.326
- just clean this up.
- No no no.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.429
No no no no no. Don't touch anything.

33:54.463 --> 33:56.364
Here. I'm driving.

33:56.399 --> 33:58.333
Go go go go. It's gonna be fine.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.275
Hey, buddy.

34:08.311 --> 34:10.344
Need a ride home?

34:10.379 --> 34:11.646
No, man.

34:11.681 --> 34:15.216
I live like a 10-minute walk that way

34:15.251 --> 34:18.553
in the dorms, the prison-like dorms.

34:18.587 --> 34:22.424
Well, my roommate's got
a girl over there, so...

34:22.458 --> 34:24.326
You know he doesn't even talk to me.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.395
He's buddies with a bunch
of the guys from my...

34:27.429 --> 34:29.496
from my ex-frat.

34:29.532 --> 34:32.233
He just doesn't even speak to me.

34:33.703 --> 34:35.603
Good night.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.339
Come on, man.

34:37.373 --> 34:39.373
- You're coming with me.
- (Mumbles)

34:39.408 --> 34:41.609
- Come on, let's go.
- No. (Groans)

34:41.643 --> 34:44.245
- Do you want some help?
- Oh.

34:45.681 --> 34:46.648
Hello again.

34:46.681 --> 34:48.483
(Grunts) Bugger!

34:48.516 --> 34:50.284
(Both grunting)

34:50.319 --> 34:51.518
I guess this is why they call you Tank.

34:51.554 --> 34:52.721
I thought your name was Miles.

34:52.755 --> 34:54.489
It is.

34:54.523 --> 34:56.358
I'm just redefining myself.

34:56.391 --> 34:58.460
I'm a new man.

34:58.494 --> 35:00.261
Well, come on, new man.

35:00.296 --> 35:02.230
You need a ride home too?

35:02.264 --> 35:04.366
I was gonna get a cab, but yeah, thanks.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.500
Shotgun!

35:09.305 --> 35:11.639
Oh, no no no no. You don't have to.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.575
No, you don't have to do this.

35:13.609 --> 35:15.477
Of course I do.

35:15.511 --> 35:17.679
I'm really sorry about tonight.

35:17.713 --> 35:21.449
Renzo's just so wonderful,
and you're so wonderful,

35:21.484 --> 35:22.617
- and I just thought...
- I know.

35:22.651 --> 35:24.486
And I appreciate you trying.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.689
He's not usually like that, I swear.

35:27.723 --> 35:29.657
I believe you.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.659
It's just...

35:33.496 --> 35:37.265
I've just been feeling so useless and sad.

35:37.299 --> 35:38.633
- I thought maybe...
- No, I...

35:38.667 --> 35:41.603
I just don't need a boyfriend right now.

35:41.637 --> 35:43.605
(Sighs) Yeah.

35:47.276 --> 35:48.309
Well, if you need a family,

35:48.344 --> 35:50.478
you've got one right here.

35:53.582 --> 35:56.384
John loves babies. And if you need a break,

35:56.419 --> 35:59.320
we could take her or we
could go to St. Louis.

35:59.355 --> 36:01.189
It would be fun.

36:01.223 --> 36:03.224
(Swallows)

36:03.259 --> 36:04.559
Thank you.

36:06.295 --> 36:09.264
(Sniffing)

36:13.602 --> 36:15.403
Hey.

36:15.438 --> 36:16.404
Thanks for coming.

36:16.439 --> 36:18.306
I told John that you were at

36:18.340 --> 36:21.543
a super fun student center event

36:21.577 --> 36:23.278
that I could not miss.

36:23.312 --> 36:25.380
Well done. (Sniffs)

36:25.414 --> 36:28.516
Hey, what's wrong?

36:28.551 --> 36:30.251
Nothing.

36:32.455 --> 36:34.289
I did some coke.

36:34.323 --> 36:35.690
Wh... are you insane?!

36:35.724 --> 36:37.325
That stuff is addictive!

36:37.359 --> 36:39.494
I'm fine. I don't even feel it anymore.

36:39.528 --> 36:41.629
Okay, come on, let's go.

36:41.664 --> 36:42.630
Come on.

36:42.665 --> 36:44.466
- All right. Whoa.
- Oh!

36:44.500 --> 36:46.668
Oh, I need a minute.

36:47.703 --> 36:49.370
My head.

36:49.405 --> 36:51.306
(Sighs)

36:51.340 --> 36:52.607
<i>(Sighs, sniffs)</i>

37:00.216 --> 37:02.350
How did it go with your cousin?

37:04.286 --> 37:05.453
(Tersely) It was good. It was great.

37:07.356 --> 37:09.524
Have you talked to Regina today?

37:09.558 --> 37:10.625
(Scoffs) No.

37:10.659 --> 37:13.628
She hasn't responded to any of my texts.

37:13.662 --> 37:16.531
I'm worried. She's barely
been talking or sleeping.

37:20.536 --> 37:24.305
(Scoffs) It's because it's her fault.

37:26.308 --> 37:28.243
She pulled a gun on me

37:28.277 --> 37:29.544
the night of Angelo's accident.

37:29.578 --> 37:30.612
What?! Wh...

37:30.646 --> 37:33.615
She thought that I was breaking into K&D.

37:33.649 --> 37:35.483
Uh, okay.

37:35.518 --> 37:37.685
So it was a mistake.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.455
I'm sorry, wait. Regina has a gun?!

37:40.489 --> 37:44.559
Yeah, Wes made her get
it and Angelo was pissed,

37:44.593 --> 37:48.296
so they had this huge fight

37:48.330 --> 37:50.498
and she said some really...

37:50.533 --> 37:52.567
really bad things, and then he took off.

37:55.337 --> 37:57.238
But...

37:57.273 --> 38:02.243
It was an aneurysm. He died of an aneurysm.

38:02.278 --> 38:03.611
Why are you defending her?!

38:03.646 --> 38:06.180
You weren't even there!

38:10.485 --> 38:11.585
- (Groans)
- Yeah,

38:11.620 --> 38:13.187
you might want to get him a bucket.

38:13.221 --> 38:14.188
Ugh! Good idea.

38:14.222 --> 38:15.389
Ugh.

38:18.627 --> 38:20.327
Is this Carlton?

38:20.362 --> 38:21.462
Oh, you know it?

38:21.496 --> 38:23.364
I was the field hockey coach last season.

38:23.398 --> 38:25.199
I just started teaching there.

38:25.233 --> 38:27.568
No way. So you sign?

38:27.602 --> 38:28.636
I do.

38:28.670 --> 38:31.472
My brother's deaf, and I started to learn,

38:31.506 --> 38:34.475
and fell in love with
the language, I guess.

38:34.543 --> 38:38.479
So A.S.L.? Or British S.L.?

38:38.513 --> 38:39.580
I know both.

38:41.216 --> 38:42.583
- Hey, England.
- Um, Lily.

38:42.617 --> 38:43.651
It's Lily.

38:43.685 --> 38:46.453
Lily, are you seeing anybody?

38:46.488 --> 38:48.622
(Chuckles)

38:48.657 --> 38:51.425
Did that drunken pile of desperation

38:51.459 --> 38:52.493
just hit on me?

38:52.527 --> 38:54.361
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

38:54.396 --> 38:55.596
Here you go, buddy.

38:55.630 --> 38:58.499
Well, um... I'll leave you to this.

38:58.533 --> 39:00.434
I'm gonna go.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.436
Hey, if you hear anything...

39:02.470 --> 39:05.205
It's just him puking. Yeah, it's fine.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.440
We've all been there.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.442
Well, good night.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.244
Thanks for...

39:10.278 --> 39:11.378
Yeah, fine.

39:14.316 --> 39:17.251
<i>- (Door closes)
- I dig your place, man.</i>

39:17.285 --> 39:20.254
I could just sleep for days here.

39:20.288 --> 39:21.455
Thanks.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.524
Actually, um...

39:23.558 --> 39:25.259
Ah, never mind.

39:25.293 --> 39:26.527
No, what?

39:26.561 --> 39:28.395
Well...

39:28.430 --> 39:30.497
I've been thinking I need a roommate.

39:30.532 --> 39:32.466
Yeah?

39:32.500 --> 39:35.302
Is there another room in here?

39:35.337 --> 39:39.640
Um, no, I was thinking
about renting this room out,

39:39.674 --> 39:43.243
since my wife is not gonna be moving in...

39:43.278 --> 39:44.445
ex-wife.

39:44.479 --> 39:45.613
That's fun to say.

39:45.647 --> 39:48.215
Well, yeah.

39:48.249 --> 39:49.583
I could live in here.

39:49.618 --> 39:51.552
Well, you sure it wouldn't be weird

39:51.586 --> 39:53.587
with the whole Bay thing?

39:53.622 --> 39:56.323
Oh no, we're all adults...

39:56.358 --> 39:57.458
I mean, kind of. (Chuckles)

39:57.492 --> 39:59.593
And I'm very clean, sometimes.

39:59.628 --> 40:01.562
So come on, man.

40:02.697 --> 40:04.198
Let's do it.

40:05.567 --> 40:06.634
What the hell.

40:19.447 --> 40:21.548
Hey, you're home.

40:21.583 --> 40:23.684
Where's the lemon cake?

40:23.718 --> 40:25.285
The what?

40:25.320 --> 40:27.554
It was in a blue
container. I was saving it.

40:27.589 --> 40:30.290
Oh, sweetie, it was so packed in there.

40:30.325 --> 40:32.226
I started to throw some stuff out.

40:34.362 --> 40:36.330
- Why would you do that?
- I'm sorry.

40:36.364 --> 40:37.498
We can make more.

40:37.532 --> 40:39.600
No, I don't have the recipe.

40:39.634 --> 40:41.602
Now it's gone forever.

40:44.439 --> 40:46.507
- (Huffs)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:46.541 --> 40:48.475
Talk to me. How was the trip?

40:48.510 --> 40:52.346
Stop trying to pretend
like everything is fine.

40:52.380 --> 40:53.580
Nothing is fine!

40:53.615 --> 40:56.617
Daphne, I'm trying to get
through this just like you.

40:58.486 --> 41:00.287
You really want to know how my trip was?

41:00.321 --> 41:03.190
- Yeah.
- I got high, okay?

41:04.259 --> 41:06.660
I got very high.

41:06.695 --> 41:08.529
What are you gonna do about it?

41:13.435 --> 41:15.436
