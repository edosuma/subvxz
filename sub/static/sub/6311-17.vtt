09:10.637 --> 09:12.726
Why'’d you really bail on me
last time?

09:14.771 --> 09:16.730
Yeah, I guess I gotta
clear that up.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.123
Okay.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.691
Here'’s the thing.

09:21.778 --> 09:25.042
Usually, when I meet a woman,
she sees the chair right away,

09:25.129 --> 09:27.044
and I can tell
from the look in her eye

09:27.131 --> 09:29.264
whether she'’s okay
with it or not.

09:29.351 --> 09:30.526
But we met on the phone.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.834
Which is why...

09:33.921 --> 09:35.531
I couldn'’t bear the idea

09:35.618 --> 09:38.621
of you seeing me
and giving me that look.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.234
Like the woman behind you
is giving me right now.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.888
Don'’t turn around.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.237
No, don'’t...Hey.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.284
Am I staring
at the baldy you'’re with?

09:54.898 --> 09:56.987
Is it too soon
to say "I love you"?

10:01.035 --> 10:03.167
So anyway, after working
as a Hollywood stuntman

10:03.254 --> 10:04.473
for 20 some years,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.606
I felt kind of invincible.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.782
You know, the occasional
broken nose,

10:08.869 --> 10:10.610
dislocated shoulder, but nothin'’

10:10.697 --> 10:13.090
a couple of aspirin
and a six-pack couldn'’t fix.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.352
So is that how you...

10:14.439 --> 10:15.789
You'’d think so, but no.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.269
After putting my
life on the line,

10:18.356 --> 10:20.315
driving motorcycles
through fire,

10:20.402 --> 10:22.534
crashing cars into walls,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.014
working with Burt Reynolds...

10:25.755 --> 10:28.802
...I get the brilliant idea
to try snowboarding.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.455
Oh, no.I'’m thinking,

10:30.542 --> 10:31.631
I know how to ski.

10:31.718 --> 10:32.849
I know how to surf.

10:32.936 --> 10:33.937
It'’s the same thing, right?

10:34.024 --> 10:35.591
So I get up on the mountain.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.549
I got this stupid piece
of wood strapped to my feet.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.726
I am flying down the hill.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.162
I'’m doing good.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.380
I see a sign.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.208
It says,
"Danger, barranca ahead."

10:44.295 --> 10:46.384
What'’s a barranca?That'’s what I'’m thinking.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.735
I'’m looking around,
is it a bear, is it a tree?

10:48.822 --> 10:51.825
Turns out it'’s a... cliff.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.696
And you...

10:53.783 --> 10:56.046
Right off the edge.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.658
200 feet straight down.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.532
I felt like Wile E. Coyote,

11:03.619 --> 11:05.882
but substantially dumber.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.929
Oh, God.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.192
You want to hear the real
embarrassing part?

11:11.279 --> 11:12.802
Always.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.067
On the way down...

11:17.154 --> 11:19.548
I-I tried flapping my arms.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.941
[laughing]

11:22.507 --> 11:23.639
I'’m sorry.
I don'’t mean to laugh.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.380
Why? It'’s funny.
I was just...

11:25.467 --> 11:27.338
Oh, God, it really is.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.124
[laughing]

11:34.215 --> 11:35.738
[laughing]

11:35.825 --> 11:38.262
Whee!

11:38.349 --> 11:40.569
This is fun.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.614
Hang on.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.225
Oh, now you'’re just showing off.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.444
[laughing]

11:46.531 --> 11:47.837
Yeah, well, I can'’t
keep bending over

11:47.924 --> 11:49.012
to pick up my purse.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.187
Hey.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.580
Not that I'’m complaining.

11:51.667 --> 11:55.279
Okay, well, this is my stop.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.151
Tonight was great.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.587
Can we do it again?

11:58.674 --> 11:59.675
We better.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.069
Good.

12:15.082 --> 12:18.259
All right.
Well, good night.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.960
Good night.

12:31.446 --> 12:34.275
This time, I mean it.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.975
Oops.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.760
Thank you.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.037
ALL:
So?

13:06.307 --> 13:07.569
over here to see
how my date went.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.397
No. We went
to a meeting.

13:09.484 --> 13:10.833
Had coffee.And then we
drove over here

13:10.920 --> 13:12.052
to see how your date went.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.183
So how'’d
your date go?

13:13.270 --> 13:14.576
Okay.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.970
Here'’s the headline.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.667
Best date of my life.

13:18.754 --> 13:19.886
Oh, my God.Oh, that'’s so
wonderful.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.061
Great dinner.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.236
No awkward pauses.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.759
Didn'’t have to
fake any laughs.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.457
And he finished it off
with the perfect first kiss.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.068
BOTH:
Aw.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.591
I'’m so happy
for you, Bonnie.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.940
Yeah, you deserve this.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.420
I don'’t want to get
ahead of myself,

13:32.507 --> 13:34.204
but I think
Bonnie Plunkett Janikowski

13:34.291 --> 13:36.119
will get easier
to say with time.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.253
You would actually
keep Plunkett?

13:39.340 --> 13:40.428
You'’re right.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.734
Why help the
creditors find me.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.475
Listen, I think this is great,

13:44.562 --> 13:47.435
but at the risk of sounding like
a wet blanket, take it slow.

13:47.522 --> 13:48.915
Be smart.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.917
Oh, please. If I took
things slow and smart,

13:51.004 --> 13:53.267
this one wouldn'’t exist.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.183
I'’m just saying,
take it one day at a time.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.924
Well, maybe I don'’t want
to take it one day at a time.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.404
Maybe I want to be
high on life, on love.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.406
On whatever I can get high on
that doesn'’t require me

14:02.493 --> 14:04.713
going to
a freakin'’ 12 step meeting.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.412
Okay. Sorry.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.371
It'’s your life.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.462
I have a question.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.464
What'’s goin'’ on
with your boobs?

14:21.730 --> 14:23.210
Is your mom coming
to the meeting?

14:23.297 --> 14:24.689
No.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.475
She'’s got another date
with hot wheels.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.303
Oh, good for her.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.609
Yeah. I'’m not so sure.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.784
Why?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.221
Okay, so,

14:34.308 --> 14:35.657
there'’s this waitress
I work with,

14:35.744 --> 14:37.006
Andrea.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.921
I happened to mention
my mom'’s dating

14:39.008 --> 14:40.836
this former stuntman
in a wheelchair.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.794
How do you happen
to mention that?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.231
It'’s called gossip, Marjorie.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.059
I'’m not proud of it,
but there you are.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.410
Anyway, turns out,

14:49.497 --> 14:51.412
Andrea used to go out with Adam.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.674
So?

14:52.761 --> 14:54.371
She caught him cheating on her,

14:54.458 --> 14:56.591
and then he cheated
on that girl, too.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.809
So he'’s a player.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.246
Apparently.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.248
[sighs heavily]
That'’s a shame.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.640
What are you
going to do?

15:02.727 --> 15:04.077
What do you mean,
what is she going to do?

15:04.164 --> 15:05.339
She has to tell Bonnie.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.428
No, she doesn'’t.I don'’t?

15:07.515 --> 15:09.169
You don'’t know the whole story.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.258
Maybe your friend Andrea'’s
a lyin'’ whore.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.520
Jill...!

15:12.607 --> 15:13.738
Oh, come on.
She'’s a waitress.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.176
You know how they are.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.873
Hey, I'’ma waitress.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.222
Yeah, and you slept
with your married boss,

15:19.309 --> 15:20.571
a drunk fireman,

15:20.658 --> 15:22.008
your ex-husband'’s future
father-in-law...

15:22.095 --> 15:23.313
Fine! I'’m a whore.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.971
But I don'’t think Andrea'’s
lying about Adam.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.712
So the real question is,

15:30.799 --> 15:32.932
if you were my mom,
would you want to know?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.368
Yes.
No.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.283
Oh, that'’s a toughie.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.893
Thanks. Very helpful.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.156
Well, the real question is
how are you going to feel

15:40.243 --> 15:42.028
if you don'’t tell her
and she gets hurt?

15:42.115 --> 15:43.638
So you'’d tell her?

15:43.725 --> 15:45.074
Of course.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.254
[sighs]

15:55.606 --> 16:00.568
Hey, Mom...

16:00.655 --> 16:01.830
I'’m not telling her.

16:01.917 --> 16:02.831
You just said you would.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.398
I said I would
if I were you.

16:04.485 --> 16:05.660
All right, Jill, you'’re up.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.140
Wh... I'’m not telling her

16:07.227 --> 16:08.880
her new boyfriend'’s
a cheatin'’ dog.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.360
Did you get that?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.102
She wants to talk to you.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.194
How'’s the chicken?Mmm.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.630
Delicious.

16:19.717 --> 16:20.892
What are these things?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.720
Caperberries.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.766
Aha. And the sauce?

16:24.853 --> 16:26.202
Lemon butter.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.943
Mmm!
So why'’d you cheat on Andrea?

16:30.337 --> 16:31.251
[quiet cough]

16:31.338 --> 16:32.556
I'’m sorry. What?

16:32.643 --> 16:33.905
You heard me.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.820
Do you know Andrea?

16:35.907 --> 16:37.083
My daughter does.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.780
Oh.
Have you been obsessing

16:38.867 --> 16:40.129
about this all through dinner?

16:40.216 --> 16:41.652
I actually started
on the drive over.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.002
Kind of forgot about it
during the lobster bisque.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.264
Now it'’s back.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.787
I see.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.180
Would you like
some more lobster bisque?

16:49.660 --> 16:51.749
I'’d like to know what
I got myself into here.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.534
All right.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.014
I'’ll tell you.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.848
After I broke my back,

17:03.935 --> 17:05.241
I spent a year in rehab

17:05.328 --> 17:08.679
learning how to live
in this thing.

17:08.766 --> 17:12.727
I couldn'’t work anymore,
at the job that I loved...

17:12.814 --> 17:18.515
and maybe I felt like
I needed to prove to myself

17:18.602 --> 17:21.648
that I was still a man.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.215
By nailing every woman you met.

17:25.914 --> 17:29.744
I also bought
a really big truck.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.007
Red?Maybe.

17:35.576 --> 17:38.492
The point is, it'’s over.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.234
I'’m not that guy anymore.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.019
Why should I believe you?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.934
[chuckles wryly]:
Well, I don'’t know, Bonnie.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.762
I guess you'’re just going
to have to trust me.

17:47.849 --> 17:51.766
Hmm. If I had a nickel for every
time a guy said, "Trust me."

17:51.853 --> 17:53.289
Let me prove it.How?

17:54.725 --> 17:55.770
Spend the night...

17:55.857 --> 17:56.988
You owe me a nickel.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.686
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:58.773 --> 17:59.948
Let-let me finish.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.993
I'’m not talking about sex.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.434
Let'’s just spend
the night together.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.611
What would we do?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.569
I don'’t know.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.702
Talk, watch TV,

18:14.789 --> 18:15.920
play a little Boggle.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.400
Maybe that leads to Yahtzee,

18:17.487 --> 18:19.489
but that'’s your call.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.796
And then we just sleep.

18:21.883 --> 18:25.278
I hear married couples
do it all the time.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.673
How do I know you didn'’t offer
this sexless evening

18:29.760 --> 18:31.240
to someone else last night?

18:31.327 --> 18:33.286
Because we went
to the movies last night.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.070
Oh, yeah.

18:38.334 --> 18:39.553
So what do you think?

18:45.515 --> 18:50.129
I think you just sweet-talked
your way into not getting laid.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.132
Yeah.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.055
♪

19:21.682 --> 19:23.205
Hey.
Huh? Wha...?

19:25.860 --> 19:27.731
What is it?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.907
Good news.
I trust you.
