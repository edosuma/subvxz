Subtitle By | SupunWe |

01:43.010 --> 01:43.640
Land

01:44.620 --> 01:46.880
In the evolution of
human civilization...

01:46.990 --> 01:49.410
...land has played
an important part

01:49.780 --> 01:51.360
As civilizations developed...

01:51.510 --> 01:53.640
...humans wanted to
produce their own food

01:53.840 --> 01:54.850
They converted forests...

01:55.090 --> 01:58.030
...to agricultural lands
making it conducive for existence

01:58.170 --> 02:00.960
Lands they toiled in
became their God...

02:01.060 --> 02:03.670
...their religious rite and
a caste ritual

02:03.900 --> 02:05.960
Land became power!

02:07.380 --> 02:09.020
From our myths and epics...

02:09.199 --> 02:11.520
to the present
wars fought to expand borders...

02:11.740 --> 02:14.020
and to assert power...

02:14.110 --> 02:16.200
...enslave the losing side

02:23.350 --> 02:24.720
Even in Independent India...

02:24.980 --> 02:27.770
land ownership and deprivation...

02:27.900 --> 02:29.900
and the social status
associated with it...

02:30.010 --> 02:31.990
...are all unwritten laws

02:33.490 --> 02:34.860
Even after many centuries...

02:34.920 --> 02:38.070
...this hasn’t changed much
in our villages and our cities

02:38.990 --> 02:41.400
A considerable amount
of land in the cities...

02:41.530 --> 02:46.430
...is retained by the slum dwellers
through their labour and numbers

02:47.240 --> 02:49.950
We call them the ‘urban poor’

02:50.180 --> 02:53.300
They face severe
oppression in this country

02:54.800 --> 02:56.310
Corporate companies...

02:56.410 --> 02:58.720
and land mafia feel that...

02:58.830 --> 03:01.850
the land of these
under-represented people...

03:02.010 --> 03:03.760
...is ruining the beauty of the city

03:03.930 --> 03:05.040
That they are unclean...

03:05.270 --> 03:09.850
...and are criminal hubs
They want these people to be thrown out

03:14.760 --> 03:17.820
People are removed brutally
from their own land

03:18.030 --> 03:19.460
They are either thrown
outside the city...

03:19.600 --> 03:22.420
...or into match box sized
housing projects

03:22.520 --> 03:27.550
They live and die, with no land
to call their own

03:30.210 --> 03:34.950
This happens in all our cities
with all of us as the eyewitness

03:35.100 --> 03:38.020
India’s financial capital...

03:38.060 --> 03:39.800
...Mumbai is no exception to this

03:40.290 --> 03:42.080
I am reporting from the open laundry
in Dharavi’s 90 feet road

03:42.100 --> 03:43.590
The State assembly elections
are round the corner

03:43.620 --> 03:45.490
Ruling Party Chief Haridev Abhyankar...

03:45.520 --> 03:47.520
...announced 'Pure Mumbai’ scheme
in the last term

03:47.540 --> 03:49.490
A plan to demolish huts
and build apartments instead

03:49.520 --> 03:52.460
Keys to newly built houses
are handed over in many places

03:52.480 --> 03:54.590
'Puja' for the first building in Dharavi
is going on now

03:54.610 --> 03:57.110
‘Arise’, a people’s movement here
is opposing this project

03:57.140 --> 03:58.120
Come along, you will see...

03:58.190 --> 04:01.280
The ‘Bhumi Puja’
is happening on one side...

04:01.310 --> 04:05.890
...and protests by 'Arise' movement
right behind

04:05.920 --> 04:09.870
This first opposition to the scheme
has created a furore among the residents

04:10.380 --> 04:11.500
Hey, what are you doing?

04:11.560 --> 04:12.370
Move

04:12.390 --> 04:13.390
Turn it off!

04:13.460 --> 04:15.500
Stop filming!

04:15.600 --> 04:16.660
Sir, Camera!

04:22.580 --> 04:24.140
(slogan)
We wash clothes every day.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.740
We wash clothes every day!

04:25.810 --> 04:27.380
We work hard every day.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.570
We work hard every day!

04:29.000 --> 04:30.330
Our houses are ours to keep.

04:30.350 --> 04:32.400
Our houses are ours to keep!

04:32.530 --> 04:34.040
'Our land is ours to keep.'

04:34.070 --> 04:34.870
'Our land is ours to keep!'

04:34.900 --> 04:35.820
Start!

04:36.270 --> 04:37.430
'Our jobs are ours to keep.'

04:37.450 --> 04:39.120
'Our jobs are ours to keep!'

04:39.140 --> 04:40.790
Damn!
Hey, Move!

04:40.830 --> 04:42.350
- Our rights are ours to keep!
- Hey, stop

04:42.400 --> 04:43.620
- We will never give it away.
- Stop I said

04:43.650 --> 04:45.220
We are the owners and
we don’t have a problem

04:45.330 --> 04:46.240
What is your problem?

04:46.330 --> 04:47.680
Hey, you are the Secretary

04:47.870 --> 04:49.920
You would have a plan
to mint money out of this

04:50.010 --> 04:51.280
You will leave these people hanging?

04:51.420 --> 04:52.800
Are you the authority here?

04:52.840 --> 04:54.390
Dharavi is going to be
filled with buildings

04:54.410 --> 04:55.350
Saving the ‘dhobi ghat'!

04:55.410 --> 04:56.110
Hey!

04:56.750 --> 04:59.230
This ‘Akka’ has been here for 20 years

04:59.690 --> 05:02.490
What will she do
if there is no place to work?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.880
'Our rights are ours to keep.'

05:03.930 --> 05:05.370
- Brother is here. Come
- Let’s go

05:05.380 --> 05:06.690
'Our jobs are ours to keep.'

05:06.740 --> 05:08.930
I thought there won't be
any problems

05:08.950 --> 05:09.990
- Yes
- Look what is happening

05:10.020 --> 05:11.430
- Don’t worry about it
- Resolve it somehow

05:11.440 --> 05:12.040
He will come here straight

05:12.090 --> 05:14.880
Don't pick a fight with him
I warn you

05:15.990 --> 05:17.030
Why are you all scared?

05:17.110 --> 05:18.010
Huh?

05:18.210 --> 05:19.230
We are just protesting right?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.350
Start!

05:20.840 --> 05:22.480
(slogan)
Our jobs are ours to keep.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.130
Our jobs are ours to keep!

05:24.150 --> 05:25.150
- Move them
- Yes, Sir

05:25.220 --> 05:26.360
- 'Our rights are ours to keep!'
- Go back! Move!

05:27.130 --> 05:28.510
'We will never give it away.'

05:28.690 --> 05:29.900
'We will never give it away!'

05:30.230 --> 05:31.400
We wash clothes every day.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.000
We wash clothes every day!

05:34.950 --> 05:36.630
Our rights are ours to keep.

05:37.740 --> 05:39.570
- 'We will never give it away.'
- Shut up!

05:40.260 --> 05:42.250
You will demand any damn thing
if it comes for free?

05:42.280 --> 05:43.550
What did you give for free?

05:43.890 --> 05:45.420
Is Dharavi your father’s property?

05:45.440 --> 05:47.540
Your father owns this?
Tell me!

05:47.570 --> 05:48.040
Huh?

05:48.300 --> 05:49.610
'Anna', listen

05:50.300 --> 05:53.520
It's unfair to give houses for some
and not for the others

05:54.240 --> 05:55.500
In the name of 'Pure Mumbai'...

05:55.520 --> 05:57.860
...you remove only the slums
Is that enough to make India clean?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.560
Take everyone's consent
before you decide

06:01.580 --> 06:02.060
Hey!

06:02.660 --> 06:03.930
Aren’t you my relative's son?

06:04.380 --> 06:06.010
What work do you have
on 90 feet road?

06:06.290 --> 06:08.210
Hey, this is my Party’s project

06:08.630 --> 06:09.240
Look!

06:09.650 --> 06:11.660
Don’t create a ruckus
Take your people and leave

06:11.920 --> 06:12.450
Ok?

06:13.180 --> 06:15.170
I won’t spare you because
you are my relative

06:15.960 --> 06:16.880
Go back to your work

06:16.940 --> 06:17.770
- Go on, do your work
- Ey!

06:17.800 --> 06:19.000
'Finish this before evening...'
- Sssh sssh!

06:20.510 --> 06:22.780
I won’t be intimidated
by your rowdyism

06:23.350 --> 06:25.420
I am a Marathi girl!
I live right here

06:25.440 --> 06:26.320
Hey, shut up!

06:26.350 --> 06:28.210
You know who you are talking to?

06:28.240 --> 06:29.460
- I know. I can see!
- How dare you?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.040
Get down!
Step down!

06:32.180 --> 06:34.220
Don't you dare raise your voice!

06:34.260 --> 06:35.710
Shut up!
Stop it!

06:35.910 --> 06:37.220
- Stop it!
- 'Arrest them!'

06:38.520 --> 06:40.540
I give you 5 minutes

06:40.570 --> 06:42.220
Get out of here. Understand?

06:42.420 --> 06:44.170
Why are you bossing around?

06:44.280 --> 06:46.280
You wag your tail for the
money they throw at you, right?

06:46.290 --> 06:47.810
How dare you...

06:47.870 --> 06:49.040
Devi Akka!

06:49.090 --> 06:50.110
Hey! what the hell

06:51.090 --> 06:53.310
Thrash them
Throw them out

06:53.390 --> 06:54.290
Let go! Let go!

06:54.320 --> 06:56.650
Lock your arms!
'Patil, 'lathi' charge them'

06:56.700 --> 06:58.280
Hold hands
Lock! Lock!

06:58.310 --> 06:59.940
(slogan)
Arrest them! Arrest them!

07:00.460 --> 07:01.980
Arrest them! Arrest them!

07:02.480 --> 07:04.490
Arrest them! Arrest them!

07:04.510 --> 07:05.580
Chase them!

07:12.880 --> 07:15.030
Vishnubhai! How dare you
demolish the dhobi ghat!

07:15.340 --> 07:17.340
Let's see what becomes
of your arrogance in a bit

07:17.380 --> 07:19.490
Stay right here!
I will go get him

07:19.610 --> 07:20.490
Beemji!

07:20.520 --> 07:21.790
Listen to me
Don’t go

07:21.820 --> 07:22.520
Don't go

07:22.550 --> 07:24.020
DON'T...!

07:24.450 --> 07:25.450
EYYY!

07:25.790 --> 07:26.560
Listen!

07:26.670 --> 07:28.240
DON'T GO!

07:28.290 --> 07:29.480
BEEMJI!

07:32.560 --> 07:34.920
Listen Kaala,
2 runs out of the last ball

07:34.960 --> 07:36.260
Hit it slow
I will take over

07:36.530 --> 07:38.140
'Go on, big man!'

07:39.150 --> 07:39.920
Ya right!

07:40.910 --> 07:41.620
He will do it

07:41.650 --> 07:42.410
- Let’s see
- He will!

07:43.150 --> 07:44.990
Just 2 runs!
‘JUJUBI’

07:45.160 --> 07:46.730
Anna, hit a six!

07:48.830 --> 07:49.950
Watch my game now

07:50.280 --> 07:52.250
Hey! Bowl
Bowl I said

07:52.650 --> 07:54.690
Target the stumps
It is our game. Easy! Easy!

07:54.740 --> 07:56.220
All Alert!

07:56.590 --> 07:57.420
Hey, hold on

07:58.880 --> 08:00.330
Now what!

08:00.450 --> 08:01.240
Are you ready?

08:02.010 --> 08:03.470
- Put it now
- Come on, Kaala!

08:04.550 --> 08:05.360
BOWLED!

08:05.390 --> 08:06.270
OU...!

08:06.700 --> 08:08.270
'Hey! Not out'

08:08.380 --> 08:09.830
'What is it Brother-in-law!
'No...Not Out'

08:10.970 --> 08:13.120
Rajappa!
This is a No Ball

08:13.300 --> 08:13.970
What is it Bawa?

08:14.060 --> 08:15.120
No ball, see!

08:15.140 --> 08:16.530
Pa, out!

08:16.550 --> 08:18.150
No ball!

08:18.310 --> 08:19.150
Wide
Wide ball!

08:19.210 --> 08:20.540
Superb Umpire!

08:20.580 --> 08:21.410
Bawa, what say?

08:21.480 --> 08:22.800
'You are the best'

08:22.840 --> 08:25.060
- WIDE
- You and your stupid cricket!

08:25.610 --> 08:26.070
Wide!

08:33.460 --> 08:35.650
'KAALA!
They are demolishing the dhobi ghat'

08:35.880 --> 08:37.580
They beat up my mother

08:37.600 --> 08:39.490
'Lenin and Bharathi are protesting'

08:39.539 --> 08:41.059
'It’s Vishnubhai, Kaala'

08:41.130 --> 08:42.159
Vishnubhai!

08:43.480 --> 08:44.140
Siva!

09:22.230 --> 09:24.070
'We want Justice!'

09:24.130 --> 09:25.650
'Justice! Justice!'

09:25.680 --> 09:27.350
'We want Justice!'

09:27.520 --> 09:28.400
Siva Anna

09:28.950 --> 09:30.440
We have taken up this protest

09:30.930 --> 09:32.300
Don't deviate it

09:32.450 --> 09:33.580
Take them all and leave

09:33.610 --> 09:35.080
Justice! Justice!

09:35.100 --> 09:36.890
We want Justice!

09:36.920 --> 09:38.310
Justice! Justice!

09:38.470 --> 09:39.540
We want Justice!

09:42.680 --> 09:44.140
NO!
Siva Anna!

09:46.190 --> 09:47.210
Siva!
NO!

09:59.180 --> 10:00.590
Hey, what is this?

10:01.290 --> 10:02.870
This is a Law and Order problem

10:03.810 --> 10:05.210
I would have to ‘lathi' charge you

10:05.230 --> 10:06.060
Go on, let's see

10:06.370 --> 10:07.450
Let’s see you lay a finger

10:07.470 --> 10:08.320
Shut up!

10:08.340 --> 10:09.220
Do it
Let's see

10:09.370 --> 10:10.640
Sir, just one second

10:10.740 --> 10:11.960
'Saet'…Sir

10:12.400 --> 10:13.480
Let’s compromise

10:14.230 --> 10:15.640
I have sunk all my
investments in this

10:16.350 --> 10:17.710
If this project doesn’t take off...

10:18.000 --> 10:19.700
...my family will be
stranded on the streets

10:19.830 --> 10:20.400
Please Saet

10:20.720 --> 10:22.270
I will do as you say

10:22.620 --> 10:23.720
Not bad huh?

10:24.330 --> 10:27.740
A horse does eat dry grass
in desperation, huh?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.000
You think we are...

10:30.030 --> 10:32.340
...mediating for commission here?

10:35.220 --> 10:36.600
One tight slap
you will get

10:36.620 --> 10:39.410
They have hidden this
from Kaala’s knowledge

10:39.610 --> 10:41.120
Then something must be wrong

10:41.140 --> 10:42.970
300 families will lose their jobs

10:43.090 --> 10:44.800
Out of them 200 families
will not get houses

10:45.030 --> 10:46.110
Such culprits!

10:47.090 --> 10:48.740
Here comes Vishnubhai!

10:49.130 --> 10:49.910
What?

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
At the sight of you...

10:52.390 --> 10:54.630
...we will tremble in fear, is it?

10:54.660 --> 10:55.400
Anna!

10:56.700 --> 10:59.510
If you were getting involved
why would I be here?

11:00.610 --> 11:03.170
I thought he was
over-enthusiastic

11:04.260 --> 11:07.120
I am gradually rising in
the ranks of the party

11:07.920 --> 11:09.250
If I close this deal…

11:09.420 --> 11:11.920
…they have promised a seat
in the upcoming MLA election

11:12.950 --> 11:14.990
You have to...help me

11:15.990 --> 11:17.870
Am I not your brother, anyway?

11:18.050 --> 11:18.740
Hey!

11:19.020 --> 11:21.090
When you need something
you call him your brother...

11:21.420 --> 11:22.420
...shower him with love

11:22.760 --> 11:25.210
These people should suffer
for your good reputation?

11:25.350 --> 11:26.990
- That’s your plan, right
- Exactly!

11:27.860 --> 11:31.570
When you become a politician
you lose all your dignity, huh?

11:32.740 --> 11:33.970
Shameless people!

11:34.120 --> 11:36.730
Having a field day
because you have support?

11:36.760 --> 11:38.570
Don’t forget your rank!

11:38.870 --> 11:39.380
Ey!

11:39.940 --> 11:41.160
Shut the hell up!

11:41.530 --> 11:42.430
'Hey Builder!'

11:42.780 --> 11:44.250
Only you can talk

11:44.930 --> 11:47.560
Anna, don’t create problems
Please stop

11:47.580 --> 11:49.900
Kaala Saet!
They are trying to cheat you

11:50.010 --> 11:52.370
We are people who wash clothes
Who will speak for us?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.560
Where would we go, if not here?

11:54.580 --> 11:56.760
'Aren't they doing this
because we have no support'

11:56.780 --> 11:58.000
Anna, she is lying

11:58.040 --> 11:59.320
We consulted everyone

11:59.400 --> 12:00.100
Right?

12:00.130 --> 12:01.370
'Didn't you threaten me?'

12:01.400 --> 12:05.810
Everything is happening with
permissions and procedures, lawfully

12:05.840 --> 12:06.580
HEY!!

12:07.050 --> 12:09.460
Are you talking about the law to us?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.080
We know how to respect the law

12:12.450 --> 12:14.700
And if it oppresses us,
we know to....it too

12:15.710 --> 12:17.700
You are going a bit easy on us...

12:17.720 --> 12:20.410
...only because of some laws that favor us

12:21.250 --> 12:23.520
If not wouldn't you have
thrown us 7 seas away?

12:23.550 --> 12:24.380
Look!

12:24.940 --> 12:26.420
If you want your work done...

12:26.680 --> 12:29.860
...repair everything you've damaged
and change your design

12:30.590 --> 12:32.180
They wash clothes for a living

12:32.200 --> 12:33.450
They will do it right here

12:33.690 --> 12:35.320
What she says, is the law
Got it?

12:35.350 --> 12:35.850
S...Saet!

12:37.330 --> 12:38.480
Get it!

12:40.570 --> 12:42.700
Will we act against Anna’s words!

12:42.720 --> 12:43.480
No sir!

12:44.280 --> 12:47.460
Anna, we have to do
what you say, right!

12:48.060 --> 12:50.000
Builder! Listen to him

12:50.730 --> 12:52.550
I will leave now, Anna

12:53.330 --> 12:55.630
Patil! Let’s go

12:55.940 --> 12:57.030
Hey, Beemji!
- Kaala

12:57.500 --> 12:58.240
'Who was it?'

12:58.560 --> 12:59.440
He is the one

12:59.990 --> 13:01.140
- Him, is it!
- Anna...

13:01.360 --> 13:02.260
Devi...!

13:03.850 --> 13:04.890
Hit him back

13:05.500 --> 13:06.900
Ma, why are you hesitating?

13:06.940 --> 13:08.420
Go beat him up, go

13:08.770 --> 13:09.340
Anna...!

13:09.530 --> 13:10.340
'Go, Akka'

13:10.900 --> 13:12.550
Because she said
all those things...

13:12.750 --> 13:15.550
Don’t listen to them
and do something stupid

13:15.630 --> 13:16.550
'Lenin, let her go'

13:16.580 --> 13:20.590
They can only rally with their flags

13:20.610 --> 13:21.500
'They know nothing else'

13:21.530 --> 13:23.540
You bloody...

13:23.590 --> 13:25.010
Take it

13:25.900 --> 13:26.780
'Superb!'

13:28.820 --> 13:30.210
We know to hold a flag...

13:30.480 --> 13:31.270
...and to hit back

13:31.290 --> 13:32.630
Yes! Fantastic

13:33.030 --> 13:34.820
You raise a finger again
I will thrash you

13:35.080 --> 13:37.170
Hey, who are you messing with!

13:37.200 --> 13:39.020
'Ey! why are you screaming?'

13:42.720 --> 13:43.940
TAKE the hits!

13:44.190 --> 13:45.200
You are the reason for this

13:45.360 --> 13:47.560
You think I am a dud
to be beaten up by a woman?

13:47.640 --> 13:48.440
One stab...

13:48.470 --> 13:49.250
EYYY!

13:49.280 --> 13:50.360
Stop...Stop

13:50.500 --> 13:52.350
Who are you to
raise your hand against him!

13:52.400 --> 13:53.030
Huh?

13:53.090 --> 13:57.220
If Dharavi is a tiny India
with all castes, religions, languages

13:57.250 --> 13:59.980
He is its King
He is its Counsel

14:01.070 --> 14:03.600
If he gives you an order
shut the hell up and do it

14:03.620 --> 14:04.370
Do it!

14:05.570 --> 14:07.520
We are nobodies here

14:07.840 --> 14:08.780
Nothing absolutely

14:09.710 --> 14:12.260
He doesn't realise that
your flag is flying for too long

14:12.830 --> 14:13.520
He doesn't

14:14.020 --> 14:16.010
An out-dated flag
must be lowered, right!

14:18.950 --> 14:21.030
Hey...wait till the elections

14:21.540 --> 14:22.580
We will take care of this

14:23.080 --> 14:24.860
Let's hoist a new flag!

14:25.550 --> 14:27.400
'Searching for your sunglasses?
It has fallen off'

14:28.040 --> 14:30.070
Hari Daada is watching you!

14:30.520 --> 14:31.700
- Move!
- 'Hey, off!'

14:31.750 --> 14:32.810
-'Run!'
- Leave all of you

14:33.060 --> 14:33.630
Bawa!

14:34.220 --> 14:36.980
Let me share your
magnificence on facebook

14:45.890 --> 14:48.300
'Grew up in the waters of 'Tamirabarani'
Untameable, that's why'

14:48.330 --> 14:48.960
Loafing!

14:48.980 --> 14:51.660
When he was young
he went around picking fights, alright!

14:51.710 --> 14:54.960
At this age...why can’t he just
spend time with the grandkids?

14:55.070 --> 14:55.480
Instead…

14:55.510 --> 14:58.320
“Groom from Bombay”
How proud they all were!

14:58.340 --> 14:59.400
I am the one suffering now

14:59.430 --> 15:00.890
Aunty, it is “Mumbai"

15:01.910 --> 15:02.840
Ya right!

15:02.900 --> 15:05.040
Look, you have put
too much salt in this

15:05.090 --> 15:07.230
Add tamarind water
Your Uncle won't like it

15:07.380 --> 15:08.960
As if she is the
only good cook around

15:09.000 --> 15:10.820
Taking on other people's fights!

15:10.850 --> 15:13.050
They have all agreed
to build houses

15:13.340 --> 15:15.400
Why should he go and interfere?

15:15.440 --> 15:17.360
Ma, is this the first time
this is happening?

15:17.470 --> 15:18.500
Come here, I need
to speak to you

15:18.540 --> 15:20.830
Listen, speak to your father directly

15:20.860 --> 15:22.680
As if I don’t know

15:23.080 --> 15:25.260
Hey!
Tell me this

15:25.470 --> 15:27.220
You grew up right here, correct?

15:27.290 --> 15:29.360
This salary and job became possible
from here right?

15:29.600 --> 15:31.790
Now why do you find
Dharavi unacceptable?

15:31.810 --> 15:32.730
Is your wife provoking you?

15:32.760 --> 15:34.080
- Hey, What did I do?
- Why do you involve her?

15:34.250 --> 15:36.140
Let Dharavi end with me
I don’t want it for my kids

15:36.190 --> 15:38.870
Fine. Tell your wife
to stop watching Hindi soaps

15:39.480 --> 15:41.080
Hey, which bone did you break today?

15:41.100 --> 15:41.980
Nothing Ma

15:42.040 --> 15:44.540
Like father, like son
Uncle was also fighting

15:44.910 --> 15:47.510
He will fight, of course!
Let me see how long

15:47.550 --> 15:49.840
Even the daughters-in-law
don’t respect me

15:50.120 --> 15:50.880
See...

15:50.910 --> 15:53.240
I can buy him some meat...

15:53.270 --> 15:55.160
...and make some soup for my husband

15:55.230 --> 15:57.560
What will I give this one?
"VIGITARIAN" he will say

15:57.690 --> 16:00.720
Aunty! It is not "VIGITARIAN"
It’s VEGETARIAN

16:00.760 --> 16:01.620
So?!

16:01.640 --> 16:04.110
I can only say VIGITARIAN
So what?

16:04.270 --> 16:05.860
Hey, why are you hurting my son?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.990
- As if he is a child
- You know it only now!

16:08.010 --> 16:09.090
He has no brains

16:09.150 --> 16:11.020
Don’t you have aplenty?
Give him some

16:11.330 --> 16:12.350
Kids!

16:12.370 --> 16:13.680
Don’t fight when you play

16:15.620 --> 16:16.810
- Soori!
- What is it, Ma?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.530
Why are you letting the money fly?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.500
Where?

16:19.590 --> 16:21.180
Speak money and
he will be all ears

16:22.810 --> 16:24.420
- Rajappa!
- Hold on Bawa

16:24.500 --> 16:24.870
Yes Akka

16:24.900 --> 16:27.060
A friend must give good counsel

16:27.090 --> 16:28.800
Why are you provoking him?

16:29.370 --> 16:31.560
- You are always right
- Maama, sit facing the east

16:31.620 --> 16:32.550
Why now?

16:32.590 --> 16:33.830
Just do what I say

16:36.290 --> 16:37.610
You are the talk of the town

16:37.780 --> 16:41.230
Everyone was like...
“Kaala said this...Kaala did this”

16:41.720 --> 16:42.820
You were the centre of attention

16:42.940 --> 16:44.790
Listen, evil eyes should be warded off

16:44.820 --> 16:45.880
- Akka!
- 'Ok?'

16:46.210 --> 16:48.380
You yell at him non-stop

16:48.520 --> 16:50.480
But still ward off the evil eye
What an art!

16:50.500 --> 16:52.170
- Go on!
- 'Hey! Shut up'

16:52.190 --> 16:53.260
Akka, wait!

16:53.390 --> 16:55.550
- ‘What is it?’
- Look, the revolutionary is here

16:56.080 --> 16:57.360
‘Hello, Nephew!’

16:57.390 --> 16:59.010
Did you wash and dry
the clothes clean?

16:59.040 --> 17:01.090
You are trending on facebook

17:01.110 --> 17:02.320
I know you find this funny

17:03.020 --> 17:04.310
Don’t make me angry

17:04.460 --> 17:06.339
Who will cast an evil eye
on the defeated one?

17:06.430 --> 17:07.619
I am not incapable

17:08.190 --> 17:09.790
I fight for my rights
and will get them

17:10.130 --> 17:11.150
‘We saw what you got’

17:11.180 --> 17:13.000
If your husband hadn’t come
we would have won

17:13.060 --> 17:14.130
Well said, revolutionary!

17:14.150 --> 17:16.359
He would have won, my foot!

17:16.420 --> 17:18.710
You fed off my breasts
Wouldn't I know you?

17:18.780 --> 17:20.560
My husband is a Black Panther!

17:20.630 --> 17:23.550
Without him, they would have
washed clothes on your head

17:23.569 --> 17:24.530
What say?

17:24.560 --> 17:25.730
Please!

17:25.869 --> 17:27.310
Leave me out of this

17:27.859 --> 17:29.480
Tomorrow he will come with Bharathi...

17:29.510 --> 17:31.040
...and protest outside my house

17:31.190 --> 17:33.230
Hey...Ridiculing is it?

17:33.450 --> 17:34.750
- 'Saw that slap?'
- Hey! Stop it

17:34.770 --> 17:36.130
We will show them in action

17:36.150 --> 17:37.750
Let's talk when you do it
Come

17:37.790 --> 17:38.620
- Let me go
- Come

17:38.670 --> 17:41.660
Hey, Mom is just joking
Why get worked up? Sit

17:41.700 --> 17:42.840
Come. Sit

17:42.860 --> 17:44.840
Come sit next to your pair

17:45.220 --> 17:48.080
Don’t have to respect
your in-laws so much

17:48.140 --> 17:49.480
- Just come
- OH

17:49.630 --> 17:51.250
How should I show
my respect, tell me

17:51.920 --> 17:54.180
Should I lower my eyes
like a bride?

17:54.270 --> 17:55.090
Huh?

17:55.640 --> 17:56.390
Kaala!

17:56.670 --> 17:58.220
Your wife talks too much
- 'Me?!'

17:58.240 --> 17:59.000
Not at all!

17:59.030 --> 18:00.810
My wife doesn't
talk more than you

18:00.960 --> 18:02.640
Ey! Chatterbox
Enough

18:02.680 --> 18:04.090
Come sit here

18:08.840 --> 18:10.670
Uh oh! What happened dear?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.480
- He hit me
- What happened?

18:12.520 --> 18:14.280
Who? Sweetie!

18:14.450 --> 18:16.710
- Aadhi!
- Why did you do that?

18:16.860 --> 18:18.320
Grandpa, she hit me first

18:18.350 --> 18:19.390
It was him Grandpa

18:19.790 --> 18:21.450
It is mine. Give it

18:21.700 --> 18:24.260
Don’t fight ok?

18:24.290 --> 18:25.910
Who beat whom?

18:26.450 --> 18:27.690
Nobody did

18:27.720 --> 18:29.040
Nobody he says

18:29.060 --> 18:31.800
No one should fight. Ok?

18:31.920 --> 18:33.630
Akka, include everyone

18:33.650 --> 18:34.470
Alright

18:35.780 --> 18:37.190
Kaala- Our Saviour

18:37.340 --> 18:39.590
No harm should
befall my children

18:39.740 --> 18:41.800
Make everyone happy!

18:45.080 --> 18:46.200
What’s up Kaala?

18:46.650 --> 18:48.500
Warding off the evil eye
and all that

18:48.800 --> 18:49.980
Out in the open, that too

18:50.120 --> 18:51.680
Romance, full swing!

18:51.740 --> 18:52.570
Absoutely

18:52.600 --> 18:55.520
I am romancing my wife
Who will question me?

18:55.540 --> 18:57.040
At this age huh?

18:57.520 --> 18:59.000
Carry on. Have fun

18:59.030 --> 19:00.740
How old do you think we are?

19:00.770 --> 19:02.540
As you age your love increases

19:02.640 --> 19:04.200
- Am I right Maama?
- Exactly

19:04.500 --> 19:06.490
We will do a duet and dance even

19:10.230 --> 19:11.910
Hey! You start singing

19:12.050 --> 19:13.200
The young couple will dance

19:13.230 --> 19:15.440
I was just kidding
Why make it serious!

19:15.470 --> 19:16.510
Let’s dance then

19:38.310 --> 19:38.970

19:39.000 --> 19:40.350
♪ The Fearless!

19:40.390 --> 19:41.600

When you hurry
to the toilet in the morning...

27:03.020 --> 27:04.560
...is it possible to
squat peacefully?

27:04.660 --> 27:06.270
Non-stop knocking

27:06.410 --> 27:10.720
We should first put an end
to this public toilet nuisance

27:10.830 --> 27:13.670
Right! A toilet in each house
will be good

27:13.910 --> 27:15.650

meet your lovers then?

27:17.110 --> 27:19.400

step out of home

do you need?

27:27.970 --> 27:29.840

I want a Gym

27:33.050 --> 27:35.780
Hospitals, drinking water,

27:35.910 --> 27:39.200

owl to hold hands

27:42.420 --> 27:44.330

That’s it

27:45.360 --> 27:48.510

side of the story

27:48.910 --> 27:51.670

with adolescent kids

27:51.810 --> 27:53.580
You know how embarrassing it is?

27:53.610 --> 27:56.250

at least before I die

27:56.350 --> 27:57.640
That’s all!
- Bro!

27:57.940 --> 27:59.710
Fellow students say that....

27:59.740 --> 28:01.650
...Dharavi is a dump yard, an ugly place

28:01.770 --> 28:03.460
We must change the
name “Dharavi” first

28:03.550 --> 28:06.340
You are right!
Say the name Dharavi...

28:06.370 --> 28:07.830
...and the police
pull you in some case

28:07.860 --> 28:09.970
We have to make
the 'Vinayak' Temple bigger

28:10.380 --> 28:11.590
That is our identity, right?

28:11.610 --> 28:12.610
What about the Mosque?

28:12.770 --> 28:15.340
So many Telugu and Tamil Muslims
helped build it

28:15.390 --> 28:16.550
Let's not forget that

28:16.570 --> 28:19.430
Cross road, 90 feet, Kalyanwadi…

28:19.460 --> 28:23.080
...people should stop living in

28:35.610 --> 28:36.500

28:37.940 --> 28:39.480
I was born and brought
up in Dharavi

28:43.190 --> 28:45.870
My family lived
right here in Beema Chawl

28:46.390 --> 28:47.600
Whose family there?!

28:47.960 --> 28:50.310
We are Muslims from Tamilnadu

28:51.930 --> 28:53.050
When I was in school...

28:54.310 --> 28:55.100
once...

28:56.310 --> 28:57.730
...a riot took place here

28:59.170 --> 28:59.930
That's when...

29:00.850 --> 29:02.110
That's when we left

29:04.640 --> 29:06.800
I have gone around
the whole world

29:08.230 --> 29:09.720
Rio…in Brazil…

29:11.370 --> 29:13.420
- The Olympics venue?!
- Yes!

29:13.990 --> 29:15.760
That city has many big slums

29:17.310 --> 29:18.020
There...

29:18.460 --> 29:20.220
Even when I worked there

29:21.240 --> 29:22.070
The place...

29:22.340 --> 29:23.770
The place I was born...

29:24.170 --> 29:26.680
...must also be like this
was my constant thought

29:29.930 --> 29:30.750
But...

29:31.450 --> 29:32.720
I couldn't come to Dharavi

29:34.510 --> 29:35.670
It has happened today

29:37.180 --> 29:38.650
I have come with a resolution

29:39.700 --> 29:40.390
So...

29:42.390 --> 29:43.070
But...

29:43.640 --> 29:45.360
...I can’t do anything alone

29:45.970 --> 29:47.230
It's our Dharavi

29:47.480 --> 29:48.740
We must develop it together!

29:52.630 --> 29:55.820
When Dharavi was a garbage dump
nobody worried about us

29:55.940 --> 29:57.560
We are now the
centre of the city, right?

29:57.610 --> 29:59.100
Everyone’s eyeing us now
- Rightly said

29:59.130 --> 30:00.660
Govt. is backing them too

30:01.250 --> 30:02.840
We have to be careful

30:03.410 --> 30:05.410
If we stand together
nobody can do anything

30:05.430 --> 30:08.750
-'Salaam'. 'Salaam'
- Sure Bawa. One tight slap!

30:08.960 --> 30:10.210

31:49.630 --> 31:50.250
Come in

31:51.130 --> 31:52.060
Get up from here

31:52.840 --> 31:55.030
You too
- Ok Akka

31:55.130 --> 31:57.240
Hey, Akka is creating
a space for my Bawa!

31:57.260 --> 31:58.000
Get in all of you

31:58.020 --> 31:59.260
- Move
- ‘Are you all here?’

31:59.660 --> 32:01.940
Go clean the jeep, go

32:03.410 --> 32:04.820
Akka, give me a coffee too

32:05.610 --> 32:07.240
'Bawa, You carry on'

32:07.260 --> 32:09.060
Hey, Kiddos! Stop peeping

32:09.090 --> 32:09.720
Get in

32:10.080 --> 32:13.150
Bawa is struggling to talk
Staring at him!

32:31.600 --> 32:32.320
(clears throat)

32:33.290 --> 32:34.550
So nice Karikaala

32:36.460 --> 32:37.570
It is so nice to see you

32:38.510 --> 32:40.050
It's been so many years and...

32:41.140 --> 32:42.380
You look...you look well

32:42.760 --> 32:43.310
Wow!

32:44.560 --> 32:45.910
You can talk so much, is it?

32:49.160 --> 32:51.670
It has taken me so many years
to know this

32:53.200 --> 32:53.770
So...

32:54.480 --> 32:55.510
How are you, then?

33:00.440 --> 33:02.200
Are you going to be here from now?

33:03.240 --> 33:03.770
Why?

33:04.780 --> 33:06.000
You want to send me back?

33:07.370 --> 33:08.630
I am going to be here

33:12.050 --> 33:13.290
I am going to work here

33:14.000 --> 33:15.610
I need to meet builders
regarding the tender

33:17.700 --> 33:18.690
I need your help

33:20.150 --> 33:21.710
I will stand by anything
that is good

33:22.300 --> 33:24.060
Lenin works with you, right?

33:24.860 --> 33:25.610
Lenin…

33:26.170 --> 33:27.590
Lenin is very supportive

33:28.100 --> 33:29.170
You have brought him up well

33:29.390 --> 33:30.910
Very active…Bold…

33:31.970 --> 33:32.750
Just like you!

Why less?
Add more...

No!

34:15.739 --> 34:17.400

34:35.679 --> 34:37.489
Joking unaware of the situation

34:37.510 --> 34:39.030
What is it?
What?

34:40.030 --> 34:41.800
Ex- lovers have met

34:41.989 --> 34:43.870
They will have so much to talk

34:43.980 --> 34:45.280
Why are you a hindrance?

34:45.420 --> 34:47.050
One slap
your head will turn

34:47.790 --> 34:48.610
Charumathi!

34:48.620 --> 34:50.090
Ey, Bharathi!
Look, she is calling

34:50.280 --> 34:52.080
She only responds
if you call her 'Bharathi'

34:52.100 --> 34:53.600
- Wait. Eat something
- No. No

34:54.199 --> 34:55.199
My daughter is waiting

34:55.409 --> 34:56.810
- Some other day
- Alright

34:56.850 --> 34:57.290
See you all

34:57.350 --> 34:59.200
'Come often, Bawa will like it’

34:59.390 --> 35:00.240
Bye, Karikaala

35:02.650 --> 35:03.160
See you

35:07.530 --> 35:08.790
'Lenin!'

35:09.770 --> 35:11.790
Akka!

35:25.120 --> 35:26.590
How do they drink this?

35:26.620 --> 35:28.910
Why do you drink it then?

35:30.700 --> 35:31.660
Those days…

35:32.340 --> 35:34.570
'…this land was filled with
sludge and wild grass'

35:35.020 --> 35:38.800
'When our people came here
for jobs, with their kith and kin'

35:39.380 --> 35:41.740
'Veerayyan would
help them make huts'

35:42.000 --> 35:43.270
'He was the centre of everything'

35:44.020 --> 35:45.670
'Huts with 4 logs and a tarpaulin'

35:45.950 --> 35:48.390
'Then half built walls and tin roofs'

35:48.810 --> 35:50.840
'We owe our life here, today...'

35:50.860 --> 35:52.550
'...to your grandpa Veerayyan'

35:52.800 --> 35:53.980
'Every time...'

35:54.400 --> 35:57.030
'...we tried to set up a place
there were so many problems'

35:57.990 --> 35:59.560
'This Hari...'

35:59.670 --> 36:02.080
'...big leader...my foot!'

36:02.960 --> 36:05.950
'He was a nobody
compared to Veerayyan'

36:06.160 --> 36:08.300
'Hari was supported by the ruling party'

36:08.460 --> 36:13.140
They waited till we
took a space, readied it and built houses

36:13.880 --> 36:15.280
Then they would come to...

36:16.140 --> 36:17.150
...chase our people away

36:17.850 --> 36:20.760
Brave Veerayyan!
He would not allow it

36:21.210 --> 36:23.210
'Youngsters from the make-shift dorms
backed him'

36:23.270 --> 36:26.550
'Hands that toiled in farms
Won't they know to take up arms?'

36:26.600 --> 36:28.370
'Hari Daada couldn’t do anything here'

36:28.410 --> 36:30.890
'Veerayyan ruled over Dharavi like that'

36:32.030 --> 36:33.260
Hari couldn’t take it

36:34.510 --> 36:35.420
Suddenly...

36:35.450 --> 36:37.650
...Indira Gandhi declared Emergency

36:38.460 --> 36:41.860
'Hari used the situation
and entered Dharavi with the police'

36:43.040 --> 36:45.130
'To protect themselves
Veerayyan and Kaala...'

36:45.150 --> 36:46.980
'...jumped into
Pathamadai Ayub’s house'

36:47.430 --> 36:50.220
'There was no electricity back then'

36:51.090 --> 36:52.350
It was pitch-black

36:52.490 --> 36:56.490
Zareena came with a chimney lamp
and stood in front of Kaala

36:56.990 --> 36:58.250
Wow! Just wow!

36:58.570 --> 37:00.120
Bawa was swept away

37:00.630 --> 37:03.710
Uncle's heart must have
skipped a beat, right?

37:03.750 --> 37:06.200
Absolutely. Absolutely!

37:07.360 --> 37:08.280
'Akka. Look!'

37:08.650 --> 37:11.490
They had just started
SIWS Junior College

37:12.030 --> 37:13.130
My College...

37:13.230 --> 37:15.370
the water pump
at the coconut tree chawl...

37:15.760 --> 37:17.490
at the toilet near the temple...

37:17.520 --> 37:18.800
...Aurora theatre

37:18.930 --> 37:20.210
I didn't miss out
on a single place

37:21.470 --> 37:23.300
I followed her
like a madman

37:23.840 --> 37:27.090
The news about our love
spread like wildfire

37:27.750 --> 37:29.520
We never expected that...

37:30.060 --> 37:31.890
his relatives and my relatives...

37:32.150 --> 37:34.730
...would accept
our relationship so soon

37:35.300 --> 37:38.760
A life with my favorite person...

37:39.280 --> 37:42.610
...was starting and I was excited about it

37:43.000 --> 37:45.500
Thinking about it
makes me happy still!

37:46.160 --> 37:46.710
But…

37:46.730 --> 37:49.010
In his desperation
to take over Dharavi...

37:49.200 --> 37:50.870
this Hari Daada...

37:51.170 --> 37:54.180
...was trying to finish
off Veerayyan somehow

37:54.310 --> 37:57.190
He used Kaala’s wedding
as an opportunity

37:57.250 --> 37:59.840
They killed anyone
who came their way

37:59.910 --> 38:03.360
Our people didn’t know what to do

38:03.460 --> 38:06.460
Hari Daada slaughtered Veerayyan
in front of Kaala’s eyes

38:06.580 --> 38:09.140
The wedding stage was blazing

38:09.170 --> 38:13.100
That day, that fire...
separated Kaala and Zareena forever

38:14.280 --> 38:15.840
Our dreams went up in flames

38:16.300 --> 38:18.780
To get to know
that Karikaaladu was fine...

38:19.240 --> 38:20.470
...took me so many years

38:21.140 --> 38:23.180
Fearing the riots,
my grandparents...

38:23.320 --> 38:24.830
...took me to Nasik

38:26.220 --> 38:29.150
At that age I couldn’t
decide what to do

38:31.510 --> 38:34.890
A Pastor sent me
to the US to study

38:34.920 --> 38:37.850
Showing riots as a reason
they banished Kaala

38:38.370 --> 38:41.460
Almost like an exile
We didn’t know where

38:41.540 --> 38:45.070
Kaala was so lost
with no information on Zareena

38:45.330 --> 38:46.950
We couldn't find out
about her at all

38:47.150 --> 38:49.840
He started growing the beard
Hasn’t taken it since

38:49.860 --> 38:51.570
'I got married unaware of all this'

38:52.050 --> 38:53.790
Hindi sad songs, all the time

38:54.020 --> 38:57.210
♪ Between you and me ♪
It would go on and on

38:57.280 --> 38:58.660
Will I be quiet?

38:58.690 --> 39:02.660
I would even the score
with an "Ilayaraja" song

39:02.690 --> 39:04.520
‘Zareena!’
He would call in a hurry

39:04.540 --> 39:06.890
Then he will salvage it somehow

39:07.180 --> 39:08.750
I used to curse my fate

39:08.850 --> 39:10.570
Doesn't dad love you?

39:10.730 --> 39:12.760
Go ask Kaala that!

39:12.990 --> 39:14.970
He is a nobody
without this Swarna

39:15.490 --> 39:16.180
'Aunty!'

39:16.470 --> 39:19.610
I think Uncle is smitten by Zareena

39:19.630 --> 39:21.440
Why wouldn’t he!

39:21.680 --> 39:23.680
Doesn’t she look like "Madhuri Dixit"?

39:23.700 --> 39:24.920
'Hey! My Akka is the best'

39:51.110 --> 39:52.110
Come in, Zareena

39:52.700 --> 39:54.150
No. I got some work

39:54.890 --> 39:55.470
Lenin?!

39:55.500 --> 39:57.180
Lenin?

40:04.020 --> 40:04.460
There!

40:04.500 --> 40:06.060
Where the hell did he disappear?

40:06.170 --> 40:07.530
- Hey! Come soon

40:07.720 --> 40:08.650
- Zareena is waiting

40:09.220 --> 40:10.290
Zareena is waiting!

Quick. Go

- 'Were you busy?'

40:13.520 --> 40:14.750
'I was getting ready'

40:14.920 --> 40:16.180
What's all this ruckus?

40:16.260 --> 40:17.030
'Looks like it will rain'

40:17.050 --> 40:17.660
'Ya.Ya.'

…is still clear in my memory

44:30.510 --> 44:31.540
I was so scared

44:31.650 --> 44:32.870
The way you were
looking at me!

44:35.250 --> 44:35.830
I know

44:37.460 --> 44:39.370
You covered your knees
when I saw you

44:39.980 --> 44:41.370
Threw a dupatta over yourself

44:43.790 --> 44:45.340
You were wearing
a rose colour shirt and...

44:45.660 --> 44:47.150
...a brown colour skirt

44:48.140 --> 44:49.590
It hasn't left my eyes still

45:04.940 --> 45:06.290
I never thought...

45:07.280 --> 45:08.330
...this would happen

45:10.810 --> 45:11.910
But, this life…

45:12.340 --> 45:13.590
…is so strange

45:14.560 --> 45:16.020
It realises some dreams

45:17.150 --> 45:18.670
And ruins some realities

45:21.150 --> 45:21.730
Sorry!

45:27.330 --> 45:30.080
Listen, how are you
so young still?

45:34.600 --> 45:36.200
Old and grayed!

45:36.400 --> 45:37.230
But you?

45:38.820 --> 45:39.450
Thanks

45:40.880 --> 45:43.670
My daughter’s friends
say this too

45:44.150 --> 45:46.420
Hey, I was just joking

45:46.440 --> 45:48.090
You took that seriously

46:20.870 --> 46:23.700
Don’t you feel that
you missed me?

46:25.790 --> 46:26.840
I feel that a lot

46:29.280 --> 46:31.740
That we will
meet again like this...

46:33.190 --> 46:34.190
...never occurred to me

46:37.250 --> 46:38.820
Swarna trusts me so much

46:40.220 --> 46:44.140
I should make sure that
she isn't disheartened, even mildly

46:46.390 --> 46:47.250
Because...

46:48.180 --> 46:49.640
...I am her universe

46:50.690 --> 46:51.760
Just me

46:56.650 --> 46:57.650
Even now...

46:57.870 --> 46:59.380
...she would know
that I am meeting you

47:02.220 --> 47:03.490
But she didn't say a word!

47:05.590 --> 47:06.740
Your life...

47:07.730 --> 47:10.480
...will not be affected
even a bit by me

47:11.380 --> 47:13.100
Don't ever fear that

47:15.900 --> 47:16.330
I know

47:17.930 --> 47:18.930
What is this, Karikaala!

47:20.890 --> 47:22.280
I am not your Zareena

47:24.850 --> 47:25.570
I have changed

47:26.370 --> 47:27.300
Completely

47:29.220 --> 47:31.390
To be that person
in your memories...

47:32.770 --> 47:33.730
...is all I want

47:37.340 --> 47:39.870
I...I...feel
a bit weird

47:41.290 --> 47:42.160
Like, Swarna...

47:42.660 --> 47:45.460
...is right...
next to you

47:47.560 --> 47:48.450
Let’s go Karikaala

47:52.180 --> 47:53.280
Please...

47:53.830 --> 47:55.450
...don’t call me that

47:57.200 --> 47:57.700
Ok!

47:59.690 --> 48:00.560
I will leave now

48:11.390 --> 48:14.320
♪ My darling

48:14.350 --> 48:17.020
♪ My Dearest

48:17.150 --> 48:20.110
♪ What is it...

48:20.130 --> 48:22.860
♪ ...your eyes recite?

48:31.220 --> 48:33.100
Haven’t you slept yet?

48:33.450 --> 48:35.360
Sleeping with my eyes open
Can’t you see?

48:35.630 --> 48:36.280
Hey!

48:36.510 --> 48:37.950
I just went to have
a chat with her

48:37.980 --> 48:38.900
Did you?

48:39.390 --> 48:41.650
My eyes were filled with you

48:41.800 --> 48:43.360
I couldn’t even look at her

48:43.480 --> 48:44.950
Oh! What flattery!

48:45.400 --> 48:47.360
Look! I am going
to my native place

48:47.390 --> 48:47.890
Why?

48:47.910 --> 48:49.690
You think only
you had lovers?

48:49.920 --> 48:51.700
I was in Grade 8
at a Govt. school

48:51.730 --> 48:52.730
Walked all the way

48:53.100 --> 48:54.350
Drum player Perumal

48:54.430 --> 48:56.690
Was behind me like a madman

48:56.800 --> 48:57.800
I liked him as well

48:57.990 --> 48:59.530
But you
brought me here

48:59.830 --> 49:01.480
Listen, book a ticket

49:01.550 --> 49:03.460
I will go
have a chat with him

49:03.680 --> 49:04.980
Just like you

49:05.850 --> 49:07.080
Rules should be the same, right?

49:07.100 --> 49:09.580
Hey!! Swarna...

49:11.390 --> 49:11.970
Swarna...!

49:12.190 --> 49:14.000
She is not the Zareena
I had known

49:14.230 --> 49:15.500
She seems like another person

49:15.540 --> 49:17.100
She feels that
I have changed too

49:17.150 --> 49:18.220
Really?

49:18.260 --> 49:19.100
Why would I lie?

49:19.950 --> 49:20.900
Then say that you love me

49:21.020 --> 49:21.590
Hey!

49:21.960 --> 49:22.810
You won’t say, is it?

49:22.830 --> 49:24.600
Hey... No...No…
I love you my dear

49:24.620 --> 49:26.300
I love you my darling

49:27.280 --> 49:29.590
I feel like crying
But I won’t

49:29.630 --> 49:30.580
Why should I?

49:31.540 --> 49:34.290
No…No…
You shouldn’t cry my darling

49:34.310 --> 49:34.930
I love you

49:39.200 --> 49:40.040
So...

49:40.760 --> 49:42.420
...were you really
in love with Perumal?

49:44.050 --> 49:45.220
It’s raining. Wow!

49:45.730 --> 49:46.810
-Good rains right?
- Ya right!

49:58.400 --> 49:58.970
Bawa!

49:59.390 --> 50:02.140
Same message is being forwarded
for the 9th year now

50:02.160 --> 50:04.400
Idiots. I am receiving
for the 6th time

50:04.540 --> 50:05.570
‘Really?’

50:06.180 --> 50:08.750
We are going to do what
no one else could in Dharavi?

50:09.680 --> 50:11.420
How you made fun always!

50:11.460 --> 50:12.720
Watch what we do now!

50:12.750 --> 50:13.590
- Is it?
- 'On my way Madam'

50:13.640 --> 50:16.820
My dear Nephew!
Is Dharavi getting a golden makeover?

50:16.860 --> 50:18.540
'Come to coconut tree chawl'

50:18.810 --> 50:19.970
‘Arise’ movement
will lead from now on!'

50:20.420 --> 50:22.130
'Nobody can criticize us anymore'

50:22.190 --> 50:22.790
Ya, ya!

50:22.810 --> 50:25.010
'Bring that hero
of your Asura clan too'

50:25.050 --> 50:26.590
- 'OK?'
- Ya!

50:27.130 --> 50:30.360
‘Dharavi: Now
Let’s see how this is going to change'

50:30.720 --> 50:31.620
'First. Houses'

50:32.210 --> 50:36.520
'225 to 350 square feet houses'

50:36.590 --> 50:39.500
'Not for everyone
For those the Govt. qualifies...'

50:39.830 --> 50:41.010
'...In batches'

50:41.100 --> 50:42.570
'Then, Schools...'

50:42.680 --> 50:45.420
'...Hospitals, Pubs, Golf Course'

50:46.180 --> 50:49.400
'Your children will get
free education in these schools'

50:49.420 --> 50:50.880
'Rich kids
will have a separate school'

50:50.980 --> 50:52.270
'Hospital will be the same'

50:52.390 --> 50:56.260
'You can avail free treatment
ONLY during weekends'

50:56.380 --> 50:59.090
- Noticed the golf ground? - Superb
'Where do we get money for this?'

50:59.430 --> 51:00.710
'Let’s sell the buildings
along the main road'

51:00.960 --> 51:01.960
What do you think?

51:02.110 --> 51:03.420
That's not our sector
- 'We don't need freebies'

51:03.610 --> 51:04.960
- 'This side'
- 'Now you think!'

51:05.180 --> 51:08.280
'Isn't this a silent revolution
for quality!'

51:11.380 --> 51:13.320
- Thank you so much
- Thank you!

51:13.400 --> 51:14.880
So kind of you!
Thank you

51:14.980 --> 51:16.490
- Thank you so much, Sir
- Thank you so much

51:17.110 --> 51:17.620
Wow!

51:18.160 --> 51:19.440
It’s so overwhelming

51:19.880 --> 51:22.040
Saw how our new Dharavi
will look?

51:22.380 --> 51:23.050
Huh?

51:23.660 --> 51:25.560
Our Architect sir...

51:25.620 --> 51:27.510
...and our Builder
deserve a round of applause

51:30.210 --> 51:32.950
Dharavi WILL have a new name!

51:33.220 --> 51:35.670
Dharavi will be
truly liberated now

51:35.710 --> 51:38.390
Yay! My friends will visit me now
Superb!

51:40.510 --> 51:42.650
Sir, why do we need a golf course?

51:43.150 --> 51:45.730
Cricket, football and kabadi
are our games, right

51:45.910 --> 51:46.940
Hey! Quit blabbering

51:47.040 --> 51:47.790
Lenin!

51:48.280 --> 51:49.650
What’s wrong in what he said?

51:50.010 --> 51:51.300
Why do we need a golf course?

51:51.450 --> 51:52.930
Hey! It’s ok. It’s ok

51:53.340 --> 51:54.870
Everything has to become
high- class

51:54.900 --> 51:56.110
'Otherwise, how will your friends
respect you?'

51:56.150 --> 51:57.070
- 'Huh?'
- 'Exactly!'

51:57.180 --> 51:58.520
Your happiness...

51:58.640 --> 51:59.660
...is our priority

52:00.000 --> 52:02.630
Zareena Ma’am is here
to do exactly this

52:02.980 --> 52:04.880
This is a victory
for all of us!

52:06.860 --> 52:07.510
Ey!

52:08.490 --> 52:10.410
Applaud for Hari Daada’s victory!

52:11.440 --> 52:13.060
What are you looking at?

52:13.650 --> 52:15.180
Idiots! Go on

52:15.210 --> 52:16.950
Carry on! Louder

52:16.990 --> 52:17.930
You will never understand!

52:17.960 --> 52:19.030
What are you all talking about?

52:19.120 --> 52:21.080
Because Vishnu
can’t do anything directly...

52:21.170 --> 52:22.580
...you have come
in the name of change is it?

52:22.740 --> 52:25.050
He appreciates you
and you praise him

52:25.190 --> 52:26.930
You think we are mad!

52:27.000 --> 52:29.180
Uncle, you have started
your nonsense, is it?

52:29.200 --> 52:31.080
Hey! Why are you threatening him?

52:31.340 --> 52:32.600
Isn’t that the truth!

52:32.940 --> 52:34.360
Don’t you know
who Manu Builder is?

52:34.380 --> 52:36.680
Shiva, why are you
saying this?

52:37.370 --> 52:39.330
Good things are happening in Dharavi
Be happy

52:39.620 --> 52:41.590
You want these people
to live in this muck?

52:41.870 --> 52:43.910
Who came to us
when we were living in muck?

52:44.410 --> 52:44.990
Now...

52:45.200 --> 52:46.570
...because we have made it liveable

52:46.910 --> 52:48.460
They come drooling!

52:48.790 --> 52:50.750
We have Bandra Kurla complex
on one side

52:50.850 --> 52:52.280
And 5 railway stations around

52:52.490 --> 52:54.490
'Commuting from Dharavi
to anywhere in Mumbai is easy'

52:54.520 --> 52:55.250
That's the reason

52:55.270 --> 52:57.660
MLA sir, wait!
Don’t misinterpret this

52:57.670 --> 52:58.670
This is not our motive
'Who is this half-wit?'

52:58.790 --> 53:00.610
Stadiums and golf grounds
it seems

53:00.970 --> 53:03.400
It takes 74 acres
to build a golf ground

53:03.650 --> 53:05.190
Let's say you build it in 50 acres!

53:05.680 --> 53:09.270
Why should we give all that land
and end up in 225 sq.ft houses?

53:09.570 --> 53:11.570
Are we idiots to exchange
a goldmine for chaff?

53:11.650 --> 53:12.720
Ey! Bharathi

53:12.760 --> 53:15.030
Attached toilets in a house
is enough, is it?

53:15.210 --> 53:18.130
Ya! You will raise buildings here

53:18.350 --> 53:19.920
Won’t Kaala’s reputation be dented?

53:19.940 --> 53:21.000
- Hey!
- Ey!

53:21.020 --> 53:22.560
How will he survive then?

53:22.860 --> 53:24.450
He needs a share, Madam

53:24.470 --> 53:26.730
Give him that
He will be quiet

53:27.120 --> 53:28.750
Come let’s go
-'Silence!'

53:28.890 --> 53:30.000
Nonsense!

53:30.770 --> 53:32.610
Stop it
Stop it, I said

53:34.310 --> 53:36.250
So many Govts.
So many builders

53:36.420 --> 53:37.740
But nothing has changed

53:39.190 --> 53:41.620
Nothing has changed
since the time I left

53:41.930 --> 53:44.410
You have concerns, you have problems?
Then give it to me in writing

53:46.400 --> 53:47.200
KARIKAALA!

53:48.210 --> 53:50.450
You create a ruckus and
leave without a word?!

53:50.470 --> 53:51.000
Huh?

53:51.110 --> 53:53.140
Listen, let me come
straight to the issue

53:53.790 --> 53:54.740
This is our land

53:55.340 --> 53:57.430
Land that our ancestors created

53:57.450 --> 53:59.150
Ask the Govt. to help us

53:59.440 --> 54:01.490
We will build our own houses

54:01.530 --> 54:02.650
And keep it clean

54:02.680 --> 54:04.490
I guarantee you that
We all do

54:04.520 --> 54:06.990
What do you all say?
- (people agree)

54:07.280 --> 54:09.130
Govt. will do everything, is it?

54:09.160 --> 54:10.900
What will the Govt. do then?

54:11.270 --> 54:13.670
Don’t say that the Govt. is in debt

54:14.300 --> 54:17.700
Govt. officials and politicians
steal off welfare schemes and live comfortably

54:17.720 --> 54:19.610
Where did that money come from?

54:19.870 --> 54:20.690
'On the point!'

54:22.330 --> 54:24.020
You sell this land now, right now

54:24.070 --> 54:26.330
Just the land will fetch you
400 billion!

54:26.360 --> 54:28.830
You want us to give it all up
and live like losers?

54:29.480 --> 54:32.220
Hey, Rebel leader!
Shut this market and come home

54:32.470 --> 54:33.560
Infuriating…!

54:34.640 --> 54:36.160
Stupid people!

54:59.460 --> 55:00.320
Give me that spanner

55:00.630 --> 55:02.550
'Why are you breaking it?
Ma, don't interfere'

55:02.560 --> 55:03.070
'What?'

55:03.100 --> 55:05.140
Grandpa...Lenin Pa is
breaking something

55:05.270 --> 55:06.710
Let's just do our job, alright?

55:06.740 --> 55:08.860
Ey! Where are you going?

55:08.880 --> 55:10.860
- Listen to me
- Let go off me

55:11.810 --> 55:13.360
I am going to slap you now

55:13.380 --> 55:14.510
Where are you going?
- Ey!

55:14.700 --> 55:16.670
All that you broke now
are what I earned

55:16.690 --> 55:17.790
What your brothers earned

55:17.820 --> 55:18.770
I will break it all

55:19.190 --> 55:20.320
So biased all the time

55:20.680 --> 55:22.250
Say to my face that
I have no rights

55:22.280 --> 55:23.340
Beating around the bush

55:23.360 --> 55:24.870
Chi...why are you crying?

55:24.900 --> 55:26.880
Why did I give you that
Revolutionary's name

55:26.900 --> 55:28.070
I am unable to even yell at you

55:28.240 --> 55:30.620
Did I ask you?
I will change that name

55:30.640 --> 55:31.480
You keep quiet!

55:31.570 --> 55:32.700
Don’t cry my darling

55:33.130 --> 55:34.370
Let’s change that name

55:34.400 --> 55:36.470
We will call you Veerayyan...
Not that name

55:36.490 --> 55:37.750
Keep my dad's name
"Muniayya"

55:37.770 --> 55:38.290
Ma!

55:40.400 --> 55:41.680
I look funny to you too?

55:42.230 --> 55:43.140
Ganging up

55:44.900 --> 55:47.760
Hey, does it look like a movie hall?
Get lost, I warn you

55:47.890 --> 55:49.260
It’s ok dear

55:49.620 --> 55:50.140
What?

55:50.160 --> 55:52.160
We gathered a group
to do some good things

55:52.180 --> 55:53.730
He ruined it all

55:54.570 --> 55:55.890
Only he knows everything

55:55.910 --> 55:56.650
Ya...

55:56.680 --> 55:58.680
We are the pawns for your rebellion?

55:58.870 --> 56:00.700
Why not?
Are you the decision maker here?

56:00.720 --> 56:02.700
Lenin, watch your tongue!

56:02.730 --> 56:03.890
I am quite
because you are my brother

56:03.920 --> 56:06.260
What will you do?
Lay a finger, and you will get no respect

56:06.290 --> 56:07.800
What will you do?

56:08.290 --> 56:10.290
How dare you talk back!
I will slap you tight

56:10.320 --> 56:11.510
- Going on and on
- Wait! Relax!

56:11.720 --> 56:12.830
This is between us!

56:14.050 --> 56:14.600
Hey!

56:15.120 --> 56:16.600
The girl you are in love with, Bharathi

56:16.760 --> 56:18.170
Have you ever gone to her building?

56:18.770 --> 56:20.910
15 people live in those houses, suffocated

56:21.240 --> 56:23.370
Why do we need buildings
if we get only the space of a hut

56:23.390 --> 56:24.200
So?

56:24.460 --> 56:25.600
Show me a place wtihout problems!

56:25.820 --> 56:27.290
He has come to construct apartments...

56:27.370 --> 56:28.430
...not bungalows

56:28.610 --> 56:31.650
They come with money in mind
not people's welfare

56:31.810 --> 56:33.320
How will they build good houses?

56:33.750 --> 56:34.780
Hari Daada that too…

56:35.090 --> 56:38.070
When was the rich
concerned about the poor?

56:38.270 --> 56:40.730
Show me one unselfish person
Let me see?

56:40.960 --> 56:42.090
This is why...

56:42.430 --> 56:44.050
...you shouldn't do anything

56:44.240 --> 56:46.240
We shouldn’t do anything, is it?

56:46.360 --> 56:48.560
And you? Rowdyism is all you know

56:48.590 --> 56:50.730
YES! I am a rowdy

56:51.230 --> 56:52.650
People you bring are good?

56:53.060 --> 56:55.000
With money and power
rowdies become patrons!

56:56.850 --> 56:59.450
No understanding
of the land and it's people

56:59.480 --> 57:01.760
You read 2 books and go around
muttering change and revolution

57:02.180 --> 57:03.280
Understand the basics first!

57:03.550 --> 57:05.210
Yes sir, our heads are filled with clay

57:07.230 --> 57:07.950
Siva Anna

57:08.840 --> 57:09.700
You started it all, right?

57:12.880 --> 57:14.080
Poor Zareena madam

57:14.900 --> 57:16.210
So much blood

57:17.840 --> 57:18.810
Let them rot here

57:19.250 --> 57:20.200
All for them and...

57:20.220 --> 57:21.680
Oh! Wow!

57:21.810 --> 57:24.610
Everyone’s going to cry
that he is not leading their revolution!

57:24.780 --> 57:26.070
Go on! Leave

57:26.240 --> 57:27.260
I will, ofcourse

57:27.780 --> 57:30.110
I have an education and a job
I will take care of myself

57:30.390 --> 57:33.240
Slipper me if I ever
talk on their behalf

57:33.540 --> 57:34.420
Imbeciles...

57:34.850 --> 57:36.870
Muck-brains!
That's why they live in this dirt

57:36.890 --> 57:38.110
Who do you call dirty?!

57:38.410 --> 57:39.170
- Don't
- Maama

57:39.270 --> 57:40.210
Dirt is it

57:40.230 --> 57:41.460
Dei...Dei

57:41.490 --> 57:42.530
Kaala is angry

57:42.560 --> 57:43.480
Cry

57:43.570 --> 57:44.830
Don’t talk to him Pa

57:44.960 --> 57:45.890
'He has gone mad'

57:45.960 --> 57:46.730
'Cry I said'

57:46.870 --> 57:48.170
'Cry, you idiot'

57:51.860 --> 57:53.000
Yes!

57:53.030 --> 57:54.140
We are dirty and poor

57:54.800 --> 57:56.160
You grew up comfortably right

57:56.770 --> 57:59.120
That’s why these 'muck-brains'
appear low to you

57:59.140 --> 58:02.020
According to you...
whether we like it or want it

58:02.410 --> 58:03.840
We must live on the road you lay

58:04.140 --> 58:05.520
Drink the water you pour

58:05.550 --> 58:07.280
And eat the rice you give away

58:07.540 --> 58:09.520
If we refuse, you will say
"Starving dogs..."

58:09.540 --> 58:11.110
"...look at their audacity"

58:11.140 --> 58:13.570
Someone like you has
no place in my house

58:13.700 --> 58:14.210
Get out!

58:14.450 --> 58:16.500
Only if you suffer
you will understand life

58:16.750 --> 58:18.270
Ey! Send him out

58:18.290 --> 58:19.510
- Send him I said
- Maama, wait

58:19.540 --> 58:22.170
Where will he go?
Doesn't he have to think?

58:22.200 --> 58:24.560
He thought we will
stop him from going

58:24.580 --> 58:25.990
If you push him to leave
where will he go?

58:26.290 --> 58:27.300
Poor thing

58:28.310 --> 58:29.690
My sweet heart!
Dei

58:29.950 --> 58:31.350
Go be some place good

58:31.370 --> 58:32.790
Eat at the right time

58:32.820 --> 58:35.420
Take care of your health
My dear one. Ok?

58:35.980 --> 58:36.920
WHA...?

58:37.250 --> 58:38.920
What is this crowd, huh?

58:39.230 --> 58:41.390
My dear Nephew!
Going on a tour?

58:41.530 --> 58:42.020
Huh?

58:42.270 --> 58:45.010
What a swanky bag!
Long trip, is it?

58:45.090 --> 58:46.530
Buy me a souvenir
when you come

58:46.890 --> 58:48.080
Hey, cat on the wall...

58:48.200 --> 58:49.560
I will kill you first

58:49.590 --> 58:50.730
Why are you getting irked?

58:50.750 --> 58:52.180
Get in. All of you

58:59.240 --> 59:02.030
(religious chants)

59:05.590 --> 59:07.310
Oh Lord Ganpathi!
'Moriya!'

59:21.520 --> 59:23.360
Hey, isn't the elevator working?

59:32.600 --> 59:33.760
'Where are you going?'

59:37.210 --> 59:37.750
Hey!

59:38.540 --> 59:40.270
Are we here or further up?

59:41.680 --> 59:42.400
Come!

59:43.850 --> 59:44.900
Where are you going, Akka?

59:44.920 --> 59:46.230
To the Temple, Bharathi

59:46.460 --> 59:47.210
Ok!

59:52.590 --> 59:53.070
Come

59:57.000 --> 59:58.570
Let's go out

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.800
Lenin!

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.440
Think about it, Lenin

01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:11.740
I feel that Kaala is...

01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:13.530
...doing the right thing

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.350
- Siva
- Ma, shall we move?

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.660
- Where is Dad?
- Back there!

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.190
Ey! Quick

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.490
You know Zareena's house
for sure, right?

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.860
I know, Kaala
Come, let’s go

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.370
Don’t drop me off
somewhere else

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.620
Kaala, I know every
nook and corner here

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:39.830
Why are you scared
like a kid?

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.970
Scared is it?!
Move

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.560
Why are you getting tensed Kaala?

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.540
Hurry up!

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.890
- Sit, fast
-Kaala is going alone somewhere!

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:55.980
Brother, Kaala is going via Sion
We got a call

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:56.490
What?

01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:57.570
Kaala is going alone

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:58.740
We can finish him off now

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:00.490
- Sure, it’s him?
- Yes

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.050
- Confirmed?
- Yes!

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.850
He is right here
Quick! Quick

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.810
Take left!

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:22.730
This is the house, Kaala

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.720
Why are you scared Kaala?
I am here with you right?

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:36.380
Cool

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.720
Hey! Buzz off

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.160
See, didn’t I tell you?

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.570
Leave…!

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.080
Carry on! Have fun!

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.860
Hi...!

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.090
Hi...!

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:01.390
Kaeira, go to the other room

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:03.310
Kaeira, beautiful name!

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.520
Kaeira means Black in Greek right?

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.830
Yes. It means “Kaala”

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.550
Kaeira finish your homework. Go

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:10.430
You both talk
I'll go. Ok?

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:20.370
Errr...

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.590
I don’t know what to say!

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.180
If you were alright...

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:27.070
...none of this will matter

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.810
KARIKAA…

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:28.790
Sorry

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.550
I am totally fine

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.670
I heard that you were hurt
That’s why I came to see you

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:35.460
Thanks!

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.130
Thanks a lot Karikaala!

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:39.500
Sorry, Sorry!
I should call you KAALA

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:41.130
So much concern!

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.000
I am ok!

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.610
I will leave now

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.200
What good has come
to the people who trust you?

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.390
What were you doing
all these days?

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.630
Could you bring a single builder?

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.330
That poor Architect…

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.560
So...

01:02:58.070 --> 01:02:59.800
What you say
must happen here, is it?

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.140
You know nothing beyond rowdyism

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.740
I am not the one
to get scared of all this

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:08.700
Don’t spill your words in anger

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:11.250
You don’t realise
who is behind all this

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.890
That’s the truth!

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:13.000
That Hari…

01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:15.390
…can’t be involved directly

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.500
He comes disguised as a builder
behind your NGO

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.470
You are just crazy
refusing to see this

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:20.350
Stop it!

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.690
Don’t judge me!

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.850
Crazy, is it?
Am I crazy?

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.190
I know what I am!

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.890
Ok?

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:34.670
I was born here too

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:38.190
You treat me like
I support Hari Daada

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.970
You want to settle
your enmity with him

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.090
And you use people
as lambs to this slaughter

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:43.380
I won’t let it happen

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:46.210
I know how exactly
to implement this scheme

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:48.090
I will do it, Mr. KAALA

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.210
Hello…

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:55.030
"Africa- return" Madam

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.580
I will always be
selfish about our rights

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:02.700
My people are not lambs
to be slaughtered by anybody

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.310
You can't lay a single brick
in the name of Manu Builders!

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.560
Listen Kaeira’s mother!

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:16.440
You haven’t seen my
downright rowdyism yet!

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.790
You will!

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.450
Got it?
Please do!

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:23.750
Karikaala!

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:34.320
Hey! Don’t roam
the streets aimlessly, alright?

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:35.920
I am not doing that Kaala

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.570
Concentrate on taking care
of your mother, alright?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600
Ok!

01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:45.250
Hey, why are you going this way?

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.690
Let’s- Let's go this way, Kaala

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.140
Why are you turning around?
We have to go this way

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:58.690
Kaala, wait…

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:00.730
Why this detour?

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:10.770
Why are you doing this?

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:12.320
- What happened?
- Kaala!

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.710
They have rounded us up

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.360
Stop the bike
I said stop!

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.370
Hey! Go

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.840
Kaala!

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.990
Step back, I said

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.250
What’s up guys?

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:31.850
Setup is it?

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:35.100
I, Veerayyan’s Son,
Am standing all alone

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.050
Come on, if you have the guts!

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:42.090
Let’s fight it out

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:10.230
Pa!

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:33.810
I will finish you off first...

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.480
...then your father

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:38.180
I will kill you

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.540
- Bro! Come let’s go
- Let's move

01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:45.990
Beemji!
Come

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:27.370
Couldn't you have told me?

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.480
You sent our son
anyway, right

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.840
Even if you don’t utter a word
your every breath tells me...

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:34.160
...what runs in your head!

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:34.830
Oh!

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.540
Is it?

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.640
Tell me what I am thinking now?

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.780
I know, Mr. Karikaala!

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.320
'KAALA!'

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.090
'KAALA!'

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.990
What happened?

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:52.060
KAALA!

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.420
They killed my son!

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.940
My son is hanging dead!

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:02.870
My son is hanging dead there, Kaala

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:04.860
My son is hanging there

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.410
'BEEMJI!'

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.960
'Look what they have
done to you'

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:14.920
'Who else do I have?'

01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:22.960
'Oh! Damn!'

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:25.529
Beema!

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.729
'When will I hear you
sing after this?'

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:35.130
Kaala!

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:39.370
Come!
Bring him down

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:46.200
♪ Will he come alive?
Tell us Kaala!

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.680
♪ What shall we do
Tell us Kaala

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:51.210
♪ How many more lives?
Tell us Kaala

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.520
♪ What shall we do
Tell us Kaala

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:56.050
♪ What shall we do
Tell us Kaala

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.189
We will get him
Where will he go?

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:31.689
Sir?
'Where is Vishnu?'

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.800
Right here, Sir
- 'Tell him, too'

01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:34.760
I will, Sir

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.970
Sunil brother had called

01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:42.580
Hari Daada has told you
not to surrender

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.790
It’s a matter of his prestige

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.149
His men will come now

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:49.990
Go with them

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:52.310
Nobody can touch you!

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:55.000
Being with them
is safer than the prison

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.200
Ok?

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.050
All ok?

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:07.140
Let’s leave

01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:08.520
Patil, See you!

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.940
Kill him, now!

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.370
Hey! Kill me!

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.300
Come on!

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:50.280
They killed him, Sir

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.370
(announcement on PA)

01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:05.950
Move! Give way please

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.180
Anna, Move and give way

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.640
Move all of you
Move

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.950
Give way!

01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:15.690
Give way!

01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:44.180
Welcome! Welcome!
Hari Daada

01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:52.160
I am so glad
you came here!

01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:56.340
Right!

01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:59.960
You are Kaala Saet!

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.270
I have heard a lot about you

01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:08.320
But seeing you
for the first time

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:10.200
I see you everyday

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:12.140
You are omnipresent!

01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:13.440
Great!

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:14.870
Pleasure is ours

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.670
Siva, my second son

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:27.830
My friends

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.710
Namaste

01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:29.860
My Sons, Daughters-in-law

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.130
Namaste

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:31.910
My wife

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:33.110
Namashkar

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:34.530
Thank you!

01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:36.890
It’s ok

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:38.340
This is 'Aasami'

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.330
Bawa, what about me?

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.240
My close pal Rajappa!

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.600
He looks like a good man

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:45.600
You are right

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.880
In his white and white…

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:49.400
Shut up! Is it enough to wear white?

01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:51.080
He didn’t even drink water
from our house

01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:10.100
I wanted to meet the person
messing with my dreams

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.540
Just came to take a look

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:14.730
Take a good look then

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.700
It was nice meeting you
and your family

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:24.500
Now, let Dharavi be
a memory of your past

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.470
Because from now
Dharavi will be mine

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:30.610
Just mine!

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:37.260
Sister, take care of him

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720
Hari Daada!

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.460
I didn’t say
you could leave!

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.370
You could have
entered Dharavi at will!

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:54.770
But to leave
you need my permission

01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:07.020
Let's move!

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.310
Take left

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:20.170
Ok! Right!

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:29.980
'Let me see'

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:02.500
Hello, Sir

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:04.350
They have blocked the entrance

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:05.320
We are trying

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.740
We are locked up here

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.150
What are you doing, huh?
Do something!

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560
Patil, what happened?

01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:13.320
Sunil just called…They are…

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:16.230
- Don’t tell me what’s happening there
- We are trying, Sir

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.920
Daada, we are trapped
It will be difficult to get out

01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:24.220
We must shoot all of them down
Then we can leave

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:28.900
How many bullets do you have?

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:34.380
Hello

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.990
'Has the Minister arrived?'

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.670
'Ask him to call me'

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:15.120
'Hey!
Look here!'

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:19.060
What happened?

01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:21.260
Lost your sense of
East and West in Dharavi?

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.690
Kaala’s house is right here

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:24.710
Apologise and go home soon!

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:25.120
Go!

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:40.650
Give him way!

01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:54.510
Take permission and leave

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.850
Can I leave?

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.070
Kaala Saet, can I go?

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.130
This is Black Fort

01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:32.790
My Fort!

01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:38.350
You can’t take even a
fistful of sand out of here

01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:40.270
Get out!

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:45.600
♪ Get out! Get out!
Buzz off!

(video plays on phone)

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.430
Ahaana, look here!

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:32.170
- Grandpa!
- Show me

01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:33.640
Show me also

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.530
Grandpa...

01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:45.790
Your video is on facebook

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:48.350
Who is Kaala, Grandpa?

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.150
Ravana!

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:54.550
The Demon King!

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.440
Thinks with his ten heads

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:02.680
So...
Ram will kill Ravana?

01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:16.060
Grandpa, why are you laughing?

01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:21.660
Vaalmiki has written it that way!

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.970
He must be killed right!

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.180
Sir, this is Zareena

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.090
ZAREENA!

01:23:56.670 --> 01:24:00.200
She is working towards
getting people's consent

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:02.100
Sir...

01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:05.610
Sir, I am very sorry about
what happened in Dharavi

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:06.840
But...

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:09.800
If your company refuses...

01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:11.580
...our people will really suffer

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.070
Actually sir, there are
only very few people...

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.560
...who are misguided in Dharavi

01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:20.450
'Because some people oppose
everyone shouldn't suffer, right?'

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.100
I have always thought about
people's welfare

01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:24.460
'Absolutely'

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.180
- What is his name?
- 'Who?'

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.940
Kaala

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.100
KAALA

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.460
Ya, Kaala

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:33.830
To err is human, right?

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.400
For one person's mistake...

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.620
...why punish another?

01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:41.290
Get the consent
for the scheme

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.650
I will stand by you

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.500
I want to make this country, clean...

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.670
...and pure

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:47.970
'Ya. Absolutely'

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:48.910
'Thank you Sir'

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:51.230
We were hoping the same

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.050
And don't worry. We will get the consent
as soon as possible

01:24:55.650 --> 01:24:58.340
You come all the way from Africa
and do all this

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.310
This is my land, my people,
my blood!

01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:01.640
Shouldn't I do something too?

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.370
What does your husband do?

01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:09.260
No...actually...
I am a single mother

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:12.700
I AM A SINGLE MOTHER
I have a daughter, Kaeira

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:15.930
Take Care!

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:18.480
A woman...

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:21.170
You might be short of funds...

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:23.020
All alone in Mumbai...

01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:26.550
Help her if she needs something

01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:27.760
'Sure Sir!'

01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:34.900
His name is Lenin

01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:37.710

He is one of us

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.780
Supports us fully!

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.050
''Full support''

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:45.530
Lenin!
Shall we leave?

01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:37.420
Bawa!

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.070
Come here

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.170
Just a minute

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.470
'Come Bawa'

01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:44.770
Give me a good piece

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.170
- Hey Suresh!
- AAAYY!

01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:48.430
It's me man!
It's just me

01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:50.570
Wow!
Just wow!

01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:52.260
Isn't this the ultimate wedding!

01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:54.660
Who will believe
that you are 60?

01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:57.550
You look just like the Actor NTR

01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.790
Your youth is returning!

01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:00.350
Me?!

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:01.710
Very funny!

01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:03.920
The children insisted
I put this on

01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:04.740
AKKA!

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.930
You don't match
my Brother-in-law's good looks

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:08.550
Accept it!

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:09.680
Hey! Why?

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:11.740
Why are you pulling her into this!

01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:12.930
What's happening Maama?

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.770
What is he saying?
I am unable to hear

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.830
I was telling him that you
look like a gold statue

01:28:20.970 --> 01:28:22.220
Well said Maama!

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:24.440
Hey Rajappa!
Heard that?

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.270
Of course, Gold Statue

01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:27.890
Why get myself into trouble?

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:31.120
Even the Great Haridaada
is scared of your husband

01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:33.870
But look how he is
around you

01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:35.720
Live long!

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.390
Come and eat

01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:41.520
Anna, eat some food
for my sake

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.390
Where is the meat?

01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:44.380
- Here. Here.
- 'Feed him the meat'

01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:45.630
Give him lots

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.040
Bawa here!

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.110
Drink it!

01:28:50.010 --> 01:28:51.240
My gift for your wedding

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.590
Toddy from a single palm

01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:53.800
An offering to our God

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:55.310
Bottoms up!

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:56.510
He will take care of it

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.850
Won't you drink for me?

01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:58.550
Drink up!

01:28:58.570 --> 01:28:59.710
Hey Rajappa!

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.500
You are making Kaala drink?!

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.770
Hey! Is this foreign liquor?

01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:05.500
This is part of our cuisine!

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:06.800
Drink it Bawa!

01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:09.200
Drink for my sake

01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:11.870
Gulp it!

01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:13.630
Like that!

01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.760
Drink! Drink!

01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.560
Ok?

01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:19.940
Hey! Rajappa

01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:21.180
Damn!

01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.540
What are you giving him?

01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:24.200
I didn't give him
He took it from me

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:27.340
You know he doesn't drink
Then why give him that?

01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:29.080
- What a wastrel!
-Bawa! Stay steady

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:30.730
I am so angry, that I...

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:31.520
Maama

01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:34.440
Maama, are you ok?

01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:35.800
Say something Maama

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.970

looking at me like that?

- Did you eat well?
- Yes! Yes!

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:45.400
- Visit us often. Ok?
- They will

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:46.750
- You leave
- I will walk you out

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:48.240
It's ok Anna
We will take care

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:48.700
Maama! quiet

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.280
- Kiddo, bye!
- Ok Uncle

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:52.340
You are high is it?

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.400
- Ey!
- Ey, is it?

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:55.870
Then...

01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:58.470
Just one bottle of toddy
And you are sooo drunk

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.010
All that dancing and singing!

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:03.280
I have been watching
You are going overboard

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.380
- Overboard?
- Yes! Careful!

01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.150
"What you are talking"

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.350
English, is it?

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:12.620
Pa, I want to talk to you

01:34:13.730 --> 01:34:14.730
Go ahead, Son

01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:16.120
You are my universe!

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:18.130
What do you want?
Go on

01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:19.920
Kids! Go in and sleep

01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:21.480
Why?

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:24.290
Kids are just playing
Why send them?

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.390
What do you want to talk?

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.750
It is so nice to see
you and mom together

01:34:31.210 --> 01:34:32.780
You struggled to bring us up

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:33.880
We live well now

01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:36.000
We have no other complaints

01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:37.880
But...

01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:40.160
Hey! Why are you hesitating?

01:34:40.730 --> 01:34:41.720
Actually, Pa

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.660
Because you disrespected Hari Daada...

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:45.670
...his men are landing up
in this one's office

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:47.710
He wanted to leave home

01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:50.180
I convinced him to
talk after the ceremony

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:51.900
Leaving?

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.660
Let us all leave!

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.490
We are doing well in our lives

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.090
Why compromise?

01:34:57.210 --> 01:35:00.730
So many people have left Dharavi
after becoming Doctors and Engineers

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:02.190
Why live in this hell?

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.330
Atleast the next generation
can be peaceful, right!

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.700
Who lacks peace now?

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.050
Are you all scared?

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:10.440
If they both were scared, they wouldn't
have brought us all up so well

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.130
Have you forgotten?

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.280
Who is he?

01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:15.510
Isn't he the one
who killed Veerayyan grandpa

01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:17.970
Listen...!
You should never fear

01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:18.960
Swarna...

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.530
Didn't you tell them stories
of our brave Vijayanagara women?

01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:25.150
- What did you teach them?
- Like they will listen!

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:26.910
You have decided to leave, right?

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:28.960
Nobody here will stop you
Leave!

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.740
You can't stay a minute more

01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:33.000
If you do...
I don't know what I will say

01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:34.040
Hey! Stop!

01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:36.430
Is this how you
speak to the children?

01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.200
Hey, listen...

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.380
She is just joking

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.290
Aunty! Why are you getting angry?

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.180
We shouldn't say anything, is it?
It is for all our good, right?

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:43.970
Ey!

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:47.990
Staying united in tough times
is the nice part. Understand?

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.900
It is such a small problem
Why are you pushing him around?

01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:55.900
One tight slap!

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.280
Uncle, just shut up

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.650
Such a drunkard!

01:35:58.810 --> 01:36:00.090
I am talking to my father

01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:01.020
- Mind your business
- EY!!!

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:03.560
How dare you
disrespect elders!

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:06.880
If you leave this place
problems will disappear, is it?

01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:09.070
You will change your place,
your language...

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.440
...your food

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.800
Leave your land and people
to live like a King elsewhere is that life

01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:16.240
If you want things to change
do it from here

01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:19.470
He left this house too

01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:20.620
But did he leave Dharavi?

01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:22.810
He and I might have
a million differences

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.640
But I don't doubt
the respect he has for this land

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.520
I am a tree
who grew right here

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.130
Burn me or bury me
But right here!

01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:34.490
- Actually...
- 'Ey!'

01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:36.610
Another word and..
Get in!

01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:37.540
Go!

01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:39.350
Get inside

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.240
'Go'

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.490
'Let's talk in the morning'

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:45.270
Think they can
take me for a ride

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.520
Must show them my real self
now and then

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.480
Rajappa!

01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:49.330
Bring that bottle here

01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:51.210
- Huh?
- It is ready

01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:52.530
- Right here
- Ey! Shut up

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.530
Maama, sit now

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:56.250
Maama!

01:36:56.890 --> 01:36:58.360
Listen to me

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.820
- Sit, Please
- For your sake

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:05.880
Alright

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:08.240
Idiot!

01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:15.070
Hey Patil!

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.180
Come! Come!

01:37:16.210 --> 01:37:16.900
Sir!

01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:18.660
Why are you late, brother?

01:37:18.690 --> 01:37:19.620
The celebrations just got over

01:37:19.650 --> 01:37:20.600
It's ok

01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:22.600
'Rajappa!
Take care of them'

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.260
Come Patil!

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:25.920
Is half a bottle ok with you?

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:26.710
Uncle! Calm down

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.500
Hey! relax

01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:29.020
A whole army is here

01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:30.320
It's alright!
'Come! Come!'

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.000
'All of you must eat'

01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.870
- Swarna!
- Huh?

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.230
Is there enough food?

01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:35.620
Maama!
Keep quiet

01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:37.470
What's happening?

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:38.940
What's up?

01:37:39.010 --> 01:37:40.010
So many of you are here

01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:41.860
There is a warrant for
Vishnu Bhai's murder

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.350
Murderer has surrendered right?

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.690
- Why are you here?
- Don't create problems now

01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:45.940
Come to the Police Station

01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:47.020
Come!

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.290
Try laying a finger!

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.350
Move back!

01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:52.000
Move!

01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.380
Grandpa!

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:09.950
SSSHH!

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.300
Relax
Don't worry

01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:17.030
Kids will get scared
Let's not create commotion

01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:19.060
- Patil
- Sir

01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:22.200
You want me to come to the station
Right?

01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:23.140
- Yes Sir
- Ok!

01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:24.350
Bawa! Hold on!

01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:26.790
What is this habit of
arresting at night?

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.460
He will come in the morning

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.720
Hey, Sivaji!

01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:34.230
How are you?
Kids are good?

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:35.270
Make them study well!

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.810
Maama!
Maama!

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:44.400
Sir!

01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.960
Hi!

01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.980
Hi!

01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:49.880
Yes Sir!

01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:50.850
Hey, Sivaji

01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:53.010
I didn't study

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.830
If only I had the chance to study...

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:56.440
WHOA!

01:38:57.810 --> 01:38:59.790
We must educate the kids

01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:00.730
Sure Sir. Absolutely
- Ok?

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.260
My father is there
I need to talk to him

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.950
Education
Very Very important

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.430
We didn't study

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:11.490
The kids must study well

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.720
- It's all your mercy
- EDUCATION

01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:21.410
Hey...Kumar!

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:23.920
Who brought you here?

01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:26.160
Patil...
- Sir?

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:27.430
Release him!
Huh?

01:39:34.210 --> 01:39:35.220
Oh!

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.530
Couldn't handle
all the food you ate?

01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:41.150
Took a stroll to digest is it?

01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:46.990
One tight slap
they will get!

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.200
Actually, Minister's
people approached me

01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:55.420
They wanted to settle
this by talking

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:58.060
That's why I arranged to
meet without further delay

01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.400
Let's talk it out Anna

01:39:59.650 --> 01:40:01.090
Minister, is it?!

01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:03.160
Namaskar
Namaskar

01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:05.070
Live long!

01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:09.590
You have contacts
at ministerial level?

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.670
Crafty guy you are!

01:40:13.730 --> 01:40:16.160
Can we fly
the peace flag now?

01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:16.890
Yes Anna

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.150
Let's do that!

01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:20.020
Why sit here for that?

01:40:20.410 --> 01:40:23.760
Let's sit in front of my house
and resolve this matter

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.390
Swarna will offer us hot coffee

01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:29.040
- What do you say, Kumar?
- Actually Anna

01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.220
- Hey Patil!
- Sir?

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.720
Is this why you brought me here?

01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:34.230
Couldn't you have told me?

01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:35.390
Sir, wait...

01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:36.420
Come

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.120
Let's go
- Hey, where are you going?

01:40:38.230 --> 01:40:39.800
I need to talk
Sit now

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.630
Kumar!

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.440
Who is this again?

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.750
Anna, he is the Minister
Don't you know?

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:50.440
OH!

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:51.790
Minister?!

01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:53.250
Namaskar!

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.390
Yes. Yes.
Sit

01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:56.000
Are you good?
- Ok. Ok

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:58.180
Your wife and children are good?

01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:01.150
Which is our Ministry?

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.450
Seeing good money?

01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.890
Money. Bribe?

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.380
Anna, why are you doing this?

01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:08.270
- Just asking about bribes
- Just sit, I said

01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:09.710
Don't you know how to behave!

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.860
Hari Daada's words have
a bearing in the Govt

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:18.670
Ok?

01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:21.380
Nothing can happen in Dharavi
without your consent, I hear

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.880
Is it?
Kumar was talking about it

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.320
Is it?
- Yes Anna

01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:27.730
Hari Daada is a good, honorable man

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.400
He will forgive you
if you apologise

01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:31.070
I will arrange for a meeting

01:41:31.710 --> 01:41:32.720
Seek apology!

01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.580
'Kumar!'

01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:36.430
Who is this guy?

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.710
(man giggles)

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:39.090
Hey, get out

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:40.880
- What is that sound?
- Nothing

01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:43.150
Why are you resisting Saet?

01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:44.430
Such influential people...

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.460
I am doing this for our good

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.430
If you do something stupid

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:50.370
You will land us all in trouble

01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:54.460
I am quiet only because
we have known each other

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.210
I will break your head, open
Step back you idiot

01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:01.980
I thought you were a respectable man

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:05.620
I am trying to
resolve this amicably

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.250
Only because you have
people's support here

01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:10.080
Let me talk to Hari Daada

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.260
Let's end this

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:16.010
How many children do you have?

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:17.660
Three, is it?

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.450
Four
- FOUR?!

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.830
A house for each of them

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.880
A house in your name

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.630
A place for your factory

01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:26.240
All this...

01:42:26.710 --> 01:42:27.220
For you

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.180
Just don't interfere in this scheme

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:31.800
(whispers)
Kumar...

01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:37.310
I won't hurt you
Come close

01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:38.670
(whispers)
What Anna?

01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:41.230
- Kumar!
- Yes

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:43.860
Who is this idiot?

01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:45.090
Why are you doing this Anna?

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.460
Are you kidding me?

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.260
You won't get out alive

01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:52.970
Migrant dog!
You want to rule Mumbai?

01:42:53.190 --> 01:42:54.170
Ey!

01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:57.630
Get involved again and
I will crush you to death

01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:01.630
What fun!

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.520
What absolute fun!

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:07.000
Go ahead if you have the gall

01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.540
One more word and I will...

01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:16.770
(indistinct argument)

01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:31.630
Welcome!
Welcome!

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.210
Hari Daada!

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.560
Namaskar!

01:43:34.710 --> 01:43:36.700
You are here too, is it?!

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:37.960
Tell me this...

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.290
Who is this?

01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:42.340
Thug?

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:44.090
Blabbering nonsense

01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:46.220
Who sends him for peace talks!

01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:49.290
I told you already
No more talks about Dharavi

01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:52.780
Bring it up again
You won't sparkle in white anymore

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.650
''Meeting over''

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:54.300
Ok?

01:43:55.090 --> 01:43:56.020
"Over. Meeting"

01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:59.650
You...I have my eyes on you

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:01.990
How dare...

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:09.660
Sivanna...

01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:11.280
...they are beating your father

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.540
'They are beating up dad'

01:44:18.570 --> 01:44:19.560
Apologise!

01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:20.700
Do it

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:22.170
Touch Kaala's feet

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:23.320
Buzz off, Idiot

01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.190
Kaala, this is not your mistake

01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:31.760
Who I am
Where I am from...

01:44:32.190 --> 01:44:33.500
...you don't seem to understand

01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:35.850
People fear me

01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:38.500
After all your mistakes...

01:44:38.530 --> 01:44:40.380
...I am ready to forgive you

01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:47.270
Release Kaala, right away!

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.920
Release Kaala, right away!

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.420
Release Kaala, right away!

01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.920
I have a status in this society

01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:02.310
Only I know the things I did
to arrive at this status

01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:05.960
How many people I killed!

01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:08.410
Right here in Dharavi...

01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:10.570
...how many riots I engineered!

01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:12.890
I am trying to forget it all

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.120
But you keep reminding me

01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:21.360
When you killed Veerayyan, you didn't expect
his son to be the end of you

01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:22.890
Right?

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:27.180
(slogans)

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.700
(slogans)

01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:30.330
(slogans)

01:45:32.970 --> 01:45:33.470
Sir...

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.010
Too many people have gathered outside

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.080
Media is here as well

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:37.930
Please...

01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:39.880
It is not advisable
to do anything now

01:45:40.630 --> 01:45:41.630
(glass shatters)

01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:46.220
(people revolt)

01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:57.180
Everyone gets a chance in life
to rectify their mistakes

01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:00.290
I have a good opportunity
to do the same

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.270
You murdered Vishnu...

01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:05.080
Defeated me in the elections...

01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:07.340
Shamed me and...

01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.880
Daada...!

01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:11.500
Daada don't do anything now

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.300
Please...please understand

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:19.330
How dare you laugh!

01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:21.570
You have no fear

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.640
The fearless and the idiot
are divided by a thin line

01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:30.070
You won't understand
even if I tell you

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:31.480
Time will tell you

01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:34.610
Proof and Justice
will not matter then

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.270
I won't do anything now

01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:42.730
All those people shouting outside...

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.170
will put you on an altar, garland you
worship you and...

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:48.970
...make you into a God
That must not happen

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.570
Hey, let him go

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.510
Laid a finger on me right!

01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.980
Ok dude!
OKAY!

01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:42.690
Why is he such a fanatic?!

01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:43.710
I want him to burn in hell

01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.110
How dare he hurt you!

01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:47.920
I am so angry that...

01:47:48.110 --> 01:47:50.200
...I want to hack him to pieces
and go to jail

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:51.220
Hey! Shut up!

01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:53.250
You think I would let him hurt me?

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.270
Wouldn't I have thrashed them all

01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:56.960
That's what I thought too
Can he lay a finger on my Maama?

01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:59.680
All that's fine
What is this on your face?

01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.870
You punched yourself, is it?
A mark of your valour?

01:48:04.130 --> 01:48:04.790
Stop laughing

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.640
'He will rot to death'

01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:07.790
'Idiot!'

01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:10.010
Why did you let go of him?

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:11.000
Of course I didn't

01:48:11.050 --> 01:48:12.260
I broke his mouth open

01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:14.250
I even brought a tooth
to make you believe

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.440
Really? Let me see
- Yes

01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:18.270
It was right here
Where did it disappear? Where?

01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.310
Are you looking for this?

01:48:19.330 --> 01:48:20.700
-Is it?
- Let go! Stop!

01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.460
Hey, why are you hiding that now?

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.750
It is all going beyond limit

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:29.780
She comes there
stands there and weeps...

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.980
...and when I see
she wipes off her tears

01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:34.380
I don't know where
all this is going

01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:35.380
I will wait to watch

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:36.910
Hey! Stop it

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.480
Was she there?
- Huh?

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:41.880
Look at your eyes widening!

01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:45.680
If I wasn't there
you would have married her, right?

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:50.440
Tell me frankly
This heart can take it all

01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.830
I love you darling!

01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:54.820
Wow! Ppah!

01:48:54.850 --> 01:48:58.200
Your words filled my ears
and went straight to my heart

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:10.980
Swarna!

01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:12.380
Swarna

01:49:13.730 --> 01:49:14.580
Are you ok?

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.950
MAAMA!

01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:26.690
PA!

01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:43.910
Siva!

01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:52.460
Siva...!

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.550
Siva!

01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:44.900
This house has lost its light!

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:49.250
My Sister, my angel that fed me!

01:50:50.190 --> 01:50:52.430
Has left us forever

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:57.170
The guardian of this house is dead!

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:16.340
♪ She was the light of our lives
She has disappeared into the darkness

01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:21.010
♪ This place filled with dance and song
Has now lost all its charm

01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:23.820
♪ The place you lived
is now a graveyard

01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:26.270
♪ Tears have swept
our dreams away

01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.810
♪ We lost the one
who loved us so much

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.110
♪ Darkness has now
engulfed our world

01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:33.750
♪ Remembering the love you showered....

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.820
My Brother-
all of you must have known

01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:38.510
My...

01:51:39.650 --> 01:51:41.790
My Mom-
Mom too

01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.550
Lenin

01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:04.290
Before one could understand
what is happening...

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.240
...so much happened

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:10.620
If I was also responsible
in some way...

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.480
...I will never
forgive myself

01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:17.740
This...

01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:20.340
This is not just
Lenin and Karikaalan's loss

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:22.510
This is a warning for all of us!

01:52:23.150 --> 01:52:25.250
You question them
and they kill you?

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.500
That is just fascism!

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:31.810
Pure Mumbai Plan
must not be implemented

01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:33.860
Don't get too emotional Madam

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.720
You don't get to decide
if this will happen or not

01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.410
Do only what you came here for

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.300
Don't say unnecessary things

01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:43.300
What the hell are you talking?
You will lose your respect...

01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:44.730
Hey Perumalsamy...

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:46.960
You are the one talking unnecessarily

01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:50.110
Go tell Hari Daada!
This project will not happen

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:51.530
This place is ours

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.890
Understand?
Get the hell out of here

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:54.290
Anna...get out of here

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:55.650
Hey! Get out

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.710
'Praise be to Lord Ram
My brothers and sisters'

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:03.590
'This is the voice of my heart'

01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:06.070
'Voice of Mumbai'

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:08.910
'When Mumbai is hurt
even a bit...'

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.100
'...the people responsible for it
lose their arm'

01:53:11.610 --> 01:53:13.300
'One doesn't know how'

01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:16.140
Digital Dharavi...

01:53:17.850 --> 01:53:19.330
...and Pure Mumbai!

01:53:19.650 --> 01:53:23.120
I salute these Govt. schemes

01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:26.620
The dirt that plagues these slums...

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:31.880
The poverty...The darkness...
I want to change it all

01:53:34.530 --> 01:53:38.580
'March on Hari Daada
We stand by you!'

01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:42.060
Some people want to
defeat this plan

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:46.930
You must root out
these anti-nationals

01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:51.840
My victory...

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.510
...is your victory

01:53:55.170 --> 01:53:56.450
Your victory

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:58.350
Is the Nation's victory!

01:54:00.170 --> 01:54:01.260
'Long live Maharashtra'

01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:13.980
'What happened?'

01:54:14.730 --> 01:54:16.490
'There is no water'

01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:18.510
It has been two days now

01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:21.550
Bawa, he has begun his game!
One tight slap!

01:54:28.630 --> 01:54:30.030
Sir, why are you locking it?

01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:31.400
Why are you locking?

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:32.500
Hello, what are you doing?

01:54:32.530 --> 01:54:34.690
Wait! Wait!
What Govt. order do you have?

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:35.490
There is a limit for everything

01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:41.370
One tight slap!

01:54:42.330 --> 01:54:42.940
We...

01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:45.240
...must do something

01:54:45.850 --> 01:54:48.280
Stop crying
I will get you crayons, ok?

01:54:59.110 --> 01:55:00.100
Thank You

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:02.150
What are you doing, Grandpa?

01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:05.990
A weapon shouldn't get rusty

01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:08.050
It must remain sharp always

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.980
This belongs to our ancestors

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:14.460
Kaala is here!

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.380
Let him in

01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:58.530
Come Kaala
Come!

01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:05.870
Come

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:16.710
Come in

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:27.960
Sit

01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:38.680
I wanted to kill you, actually

01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:41.150
Things went wrong

01:56:41.170 --> 01:56:42.640
The mistake wasn't mine, but God's!

01:56:44.850 --> 01:56:47.120
Your wife and son...

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:51.650
I am sorry

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.380
Please, forgive me

01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:57.270
Sit

01:56:58.230 --> 01:56:58.920
Sit down!

01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:09.700
(clock chimes)

01:57:12.670 --> 01:57:14.210
Mangal dear!
Get some water

01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:15.480
'Yes grandpa'

01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:17.940
- 'Careful
- Yes! Yes!'

01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:28.690
Hey...

01:57:28.810 --> 01:57:31.830
Take Grandpa's blessing
Should I tell you all this?

01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:35.040
No dear!

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:37.130
Namaste is enough

01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:38.910
Namaste!

01:57:39.590 --> 01:57:40.720
Sweet girl!

01:57:46.410 --> 01:57:47.530
(whispers)
Grandpa!

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.910
He seems to be a very nice person

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:50.920
Don't kill him

01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:55.100
Go!

01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.180
She says...

01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:03.480
...you are a very nice person

01:58:04.230 --> 01:58:05.420
"Don't kill him!"

01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:10.380
Why will I kill you
if you don't get in my way

01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:13.510
You can't kill me

01:58:14.090 --> 01:58:15.090
Because...

01:58:16.050 --> 01:58:17.340
I am KAALA

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:18.720
God of Death

01:58:19.610 --> 01:58:20.860
King "Yama"!

01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:22.660
Let's see

01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:24.800
Who the God of Death is!

01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:28.340
KAALA...

01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:30.270
What sort of a name is this man?

01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:33.450
It disgusts me when I say it

01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.690
This black colour...

01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:40.800
...is ugly to look at

01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.260
Irritates my eyes

01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:47.810
White is pure

01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:49.990
Black is dirty

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:52.790
Irritates you, is it?

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.470
What an ugly thought

01:58:56.370 --> 01:58:58.430
The problem is in your perception

01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.840
Black...

01:59:00.130 --> 01:59:01.220
...is the colour of the Proletarait

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:03.640
Come see in my chawls

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:06.460
Dust scatters into a rainbow

01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:11.540
Hygiene, clean and pure

01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:13.510
These are your masks!

01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:15.490
What do you actually want?

01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:16.770
Land?

01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:20.620
It was in someone's name yesterday
and will change hands tomorrow

01:59:20.890 --> 01:59:23.040
When you die the six feet
will not be yours permanently

01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:25.470
Why are you so maniacal?

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.440
Hey, tell me something new

01:59:27.930 --> 01:59:30.010
I know very well that
everything will be right here

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.840
I can't take anything
up there with me

01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:34.470
Six feet land is all I get

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.930
Nothing is permanent

01:59:36.170 --> 01:59:39.560
Lord Krishna has spoken in my ear
I am not unaware of all this

01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:42.960
Even then, that land...
for two days even...

01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:45.270
...should be in my name
and I will be happy

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.460
Do you have any problem?

01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:47.480
Yes I do!

01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:50.230
To you, land is power

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:52.070
To us it means life

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.610
Get it?

02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:04.110
And power is my life

02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:08.370
Power is what I live for!

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:13.770
If I throw stones
at every dog on the road

02:00:15.130 --> 02:00:17.910
I will never reach my destination

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:24.670
I am using my power
for good things

02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:27.850
If it looks wrong to you,
it's your problem

02:00:28.170 --> 02:00:30.640
Anybody who opposes me...

02:00:31.330 --> 02:00:32.260
...will die

02:00:34.590 --> 02:00:38.660
"Arjuna" stood confused in the war-front
What the Lord did that day...

02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:40.900
...is what this Hari is doing today

02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:45.140
If stealing my land is your dharma
and your God's dharma...

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:47.350
...I won't even spare your God!

02:00:48.090 --> 02:00:49.860
I made a small mistake

02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:54.130
Your wife and son
died because of me

02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.540
I feel guilty about it

02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:00.210
That's why I let you into my house

02:01:00.730 --> 02:01:03.200
What right do you have
to sit in front of me?

02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:05.270
You must know who you are!

02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:07.900
I don't like to remind you constantly

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:10.500
Throw your pride aside

02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:12.350
Come apologise to me!

02:01:12.970 --> 02:01:15.340
Just two feet
Put an end to this

02:01:15.370 --> 02:01:15.800
Come

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:21.480
The distance is the same

02:01:21.970 --> 02:01:23.150
Touch my feet

02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:26.850
I will decide if I want to
punish or forgive you

02:01:30.670 --> 02:01:32.080
Hold on!

02:01:32.250 --> 02:01:33.150
Hold on!

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.590
I didn't come here to fight

02:01:41.590 --> 02:01:45.990
You mustn't think
that my loss has shattered me

02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:49.410
You might have power

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.640
I have thousands of people
as my support, family and companions

02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:59.080
You can't do anything in Dharavi
I came here to say exactly that, all alone!

02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:01.310
Hear me out Hari...

02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:04.790
My ancestors wish!

02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:06.590
Kaala's promise

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:09.120
I won't spare you

02:02:09.670 --> 02:02:11.380
Stab me in the back, if you will

02:02:19.450 --> 02:02:20.190
Grandpa!

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:21.490
Grandpa!

02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:23.990
Thanks for not killing him

02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:28.600
Nice person!

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.000
'How dare you!'

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.810
Go! Get in!

02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.760
Did you tell everyone
to come fetch water?

02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:54.740
One by one

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.120
Patience!

02:02:57.980 --> 02:02:58.840
Patience!

02:02:59.430 --> 02:03:01.140
Perumalsamy, what are you doing?

02:03:01.170 --> 02:03:01.970
What is this nonsense?

02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:02.500
Why are you doing this?

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:04.930
We don't need this
Who permitted you to issues tokens?

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:11.910
'Who are you to evict us?'

02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:14.310
'We won't leave this place!
Get out of here'

02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:19.370
Ey! Who cut the electricity?

02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.920
Huh?

02:03:20.110 --> 02:03:22.010
If you shut the electricity
we will get scared, is it?

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:25.250
My body is a power hub!

02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:27.700
Hey you all
Come stand in queue!

02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:29.520
Take as much electricity
from my body

02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:31.840
I can supply power
to the whole of Dharavi!

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:36.290
Grandpa, isn't your name Karikaaladu?

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:37.410
That's right...

02:03:37.450 --> 02:03:38.740
Why Grandpa?

02:03:38.770 --> 02:03:44.150
Why don't you have a modern name?
Such an old name Grandpa!

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.730
Sweetie, it is a classic Telugu name

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.950
Oh!!!

02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:50.680
Grandpa, why do they call you Kaala?

02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:54.400
He is dark skinned right
That's why he is called that!

02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:57.980
Hey! That also...

02:03:58.140 --> 02:04:00.560
Remember our village festival every year?

02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:03.380
Grandpa has been given
that God's name

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:04.820
KAALA...

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:07.680
...according to our people
is our saviour

02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:09.690
Grandpa, are you a gangster?

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.590
No he is a rowdieeee!

02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:18.100
Earlier, when you questioned a bad guy
you were called a rowdy!

02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:21.340
Now it has all changed

02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:25.290
When someone is unjust to you
and you hit back...

02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:27.000
...they brand you as rowdies

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:32.440
My father questioned oppression
They killed him

02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:36.250
I had a mad determination
to avenge his death

02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:39.650
The blind rage was taking me nowhere

02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:42.350
Swarna 'ma made me realise this

02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:45.570
You are scared of Swarna 'ma right?

02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:47.590
SOOO scared

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.760
She is my angel, sweetheart

02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.440
My guardian angel!

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:55.390
The people who killed
our Uncle and Grandma...

02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:57.710
...will kill us too
My friends were talking about it

02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:58.860
But I said...

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:02.490
"We are Kaala's grandchildren
Nobody can harm us"

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:05.120
Shut up! Don't talk
more than you should

02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:07.230
Why are you chiding them?

02:05:07.250 --> 02:05:08.270
They are just...

02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:09.420
Listen to me, my darlings

02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:11.400
You have to be compassionate, always

02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:13.860
Let all this fighting end with me

02:05:15.130 --> 02:05:15.870
That...

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:18.870
That's why I lost my Swarna...

02:05:20.410 --> 02:05:21.740
...my captain Siva

02:05:23.650 --> 02:05:25.390
Damn that drink!

02:05:26.650 --> 02:05:28.530
If I wasn't drunk that day...

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:34.420
...I wouldn't have
lost them both

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:38.200
If you keep mourning the dead
who will think of the living?

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:42.330
Aims and ambitions!

02:05:43.050 --> 02:05:45.010
Siva didn't know any of that

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.120
"I will die for my father"
he would say

02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:52.430
'That is all he knew'

02:05:54.610 --> 02:05:56.160
It is painful, yes!

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:00.370
But we should lose nothing anymore

02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:03.120
Be brave!

02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:04.510
We will stand by you

02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:08.130
That's right
We mustn't lose anything

02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:10.850
We will support you
All of us

02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:12.660
Uncle, please get up

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:14.160
Kids haven't eaten too

02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:15.580
Come let's have dinner

02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:16.710
(glass breaks)

02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:18.590
Hey, who's that?

02:06:19.570 --> 02:06:20.740
Nothing. Don't worry

02:06:21.150 --> 02:06:22.900
They have set fire to our house!

02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:30.980
Get out fast!

02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:08.310
Kaala, my books are burnt

02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:10.810
How will I go to school now?

02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:16.530
Bawa!
Bawa!

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:17.730
Come take a look

02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:18.490
Come

02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:20.680
My wife's photo...

02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:22.320
Bawa!

02:08:22.770 --> 02:08:25.680
This is all I had left

02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:26.970
This is gone too

02:08:27.110 --> 02:08:28.300
Gone!

02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:28.960
'PA'

02:08:29.370 --> 02:08:30.120
Pa...

02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:31.530
15 earthmovers...

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:32.680
200 policeforce...

02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:34.830
...mercenaries in addition

02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:37.230
They want to evict us all today
by burning or demolishing

02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:39.190
Mani Saet is issuing eviction tokens

02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:41.140
Zareena and Bharathi are fighting
Let's go!

02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:52.750
There is no need!

02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:55.810
You are the reason for all this
These houses are burning because of you

02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:57.580
You burnt these houses down!

02:08:57.610 --> 02:08:58.950
This is your responsibility

02:08:58.970 --> 02:09:00.590
You are fooling all these people

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:03.000
Don't you dare raise a finger!
You are an Inspector

02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:07.950
You haven't filed the FIR

02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:08.980
'Why are you here?'

02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:26.550
Listen, good thing
we didn't lose more

02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:28.500
I am saying this as your MLA

02:09:28.730 --> 02:09:30.530
Hari Daada is involving
the state machinery

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:32.350
'Don't do anything unnecessarily'

02:09:43.130 --> 02:09:44.170
Kaala!

02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:46.300
Stop it, Patil!

02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:47.030
Shoot!

02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:48.380
MOVE!

02:09:48.570 --> 02:09:49.670
Shoot, let's see

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.810
Shoot me if you can!

02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:54.410
Shoot me!

02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:55.270
Shoot me first!

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:57.420
Do you have the guts to shoot?

02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:59.010
Will you get out alive, if you do?

02:09:59.030 --> 02:10:01.070
Shoot me, shoot!

02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:02.300
(slogan) GET OUT OF HERE

02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:04.200
GET OUT OF HERE

02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:07.970
Hey...khaki uniform!

02:10:08.630 --> 02:10:10.840
What audacity to point a gun here!

02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:13.370
You are possessed by power

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:14.880
Run away before we exorcise you

02:10:14.910 --> 02:10:15.990
I will return!

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:17.630
I will!

02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:31.080
We are worried about
what will happen now

02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:33.550
He has burnt the houses today
It will be us tomorrow

02:10:33.570 --> 02:10:34.230
He won't

02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:35.870
As long as we have
the strength to slog...

02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.110
...he would want us to obey him

02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:39.380
...and slave for him

02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:40.810
He wants us
as his slaves!

02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:42.590
He is threatening us
We must get scared

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:43.990
That is his intention

02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:46.610
How long should we live in this fear?

02:10:46.630 --> 02:10:48.610
We should just die, instead

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:49.490
Why should we die?

02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:51.320
Our lives are beyond death!

02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:52.510
We MUST live!

02:10:52.570 --> 02:10:55.400
So...should we sign
the bond of slavery?

02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:57.070
We are slaves to nobody

02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:59.260
We created this city
We created Dharavi

02:10:59.310 --> 02:11:00.760
We have a right over this

02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:02.330
This city doesn't exist without us

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:03.600
We must make him understand this

02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:06.140
We should stop working for him

02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:08.190
(slogan) Yes we will!

02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:10.490
Our body is our only weapon

02:11:11.010 --> 02:11:12.790
The whole world
must know about this

02:11:12.850 --> 02:11:13.670
Organise everyone!

02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:16.380
Hey! Where are you?
Come to Dharavi. NOW!

02:11:16.570 --> 02:11:18.790
Kaala has called for a strike
Let's leave, come on

02:11:18.810 --> 02:11:21.140
They are asking everyone to come back

02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:22.580
Strike is it?
Kaala has announced?

02:11:22.610 --> 02:11:24.160
Come! Come!
Let's go!

02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:26.080
Tell me, dear
- Kaala is calling you

02:11:26.110 --> 02:11:27.400
It's a strike, Pa

02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:29.420
Bro! Can you get down please?

02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:30.390
I can't take you

02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:31.910
Why?
- Strike

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.750
This is a protest
to prove ourselves

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:42.300
Where are you?

02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:43.490
Are you here?

02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.580
Wait! Who are you?
- Press, Sir

02:11:46.730 --> 02:11:48.350
We are seeking rights

02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:49.450
Not alms

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:52.270
One demand!
Let's say it loud and proud!

02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.140

02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:47.600
Look there

02:24:47.940 --> 02:24:51.530
"The war between them
was escalating rapidly"

02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:05.760
Hey! Who the hell are you?

02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:08.200
Don't follow the language?

02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:10.660
None of you should be here
Run away!

02:25:10.690 --> 02:25:11.400
GO!

02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:13.720
What are you glaring at?

02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:15.420
One tight slap and...

02:25:24.410 --> 02:25:25.410
Come on!

02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:29.510
"The first time Rama...

02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:33.050
...chopped off the head
of Ravana with his arrow"

02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:39.380
"Just when that head
touched the ground..."

02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:44.840
"...another head cropped up
on the shoulders of Ravana"

02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:53.920
"The second head of Ravana
was cut off"

02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:58.180
"Soon after that, another
rose into view again"

02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:02.400
"Ram kept chopping the heads"

02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:06.680
"But heads kept cropping up"

02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:09.330
'Kill him, now!'

02:26:15.390 --> 02:26:19.190
"A hundred of Ravana's heads
were chopped off at the war front"

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.700
'What's happening?'

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:24.760
'Karikaala!'

02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:27.480
You are their target

02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:28.890
One night!

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.540
Just this night!

02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:31.840
We will win

02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:33.500
Let's wait!

02:26:33.530 --> 02:26:34.810
So what if I die?

02:26:35.220 --> 02:26:36.570
Aren't you all there!

02:26:37.350 --> 02:26:39.540
Each one of you here is Kaala!

02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:53.130
KARIKAALA!

02:27:48.170 --> 02:27:49.710
Wait!

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.110
Don't be scared

02:27:57.490 --> 02:28:00.950
"As Lord Ram lifted his weapon..."

02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:03.300
"...entire forests and
the humankind"

02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:05.570
"...and all creations trembled
in fear"

02:28:08.530 --> 02:28:09.400
It's ok!

02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:18.860
"Let’s chant together
Praise be to Lord Ram"

02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:23.090
Karikaala!

02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:36.690
Go on!

02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:39.590
Go. Quick

02:28:42.690 --> 02:28:43.410
Kaala!

02:28:45.810 --> 02:28:47.210
KARIKAALA!

02:28:49.810 --> 02:28:52.950
"Let’s chant together
Praise be to Lord Ram"

02:28:52.970 --> 02:28:54.720
"HAIL"

02:29:56.060 --> 02:29:57.340
Kill him

02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:42.090
"The weapon pierced Ravana’s body
and fell to the ground"

02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:44.820
"Praise be to Lord Ram!"
Hail!

02:30:45.410 --> 02:30:46.870
Born to rule!

02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:48.330
Born to rule!

02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:03.460
"The arrow that pierced
through Ravana’s heart"

02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:05.590
"That glorious arrow"

02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:07.970
"Got out of his body"

02:31:08.170 --> 02:31:11.210
"Carried Ravana’s sinful soul"

02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:14.370
"And disappeared in earth’s core"

02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:37.780
During the curfew-riots
in Dharavi

02:31:37.810 --> 02:31:39.050
Our reporter Praveen...

02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:41.590
...collected footage risking his life

02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:44.070
They reveal that
the police led the riot...

02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:46.470
...and damaged public property

02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:48.470
At the end of a
departmental enquiry...

02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:52.260
...Dharavi Inspector Pankaj Patil
has been arrested

02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:55.980
Kaala (aka) Karikaaladu
who led the Dharavi strike...

02:31:56.010 --> 02:32:00.240
...died in a fire accident
reports the Police

02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:02.860
'But when we asked the
People of Dharavi about the same...'

02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:05.850
Idiot! What nonsense are you saying?

02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:08.640
Kaala was sitting
near the Buddha temple

02:32:08.660 --> 02:32:09.490
Get lost!

02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:11.130
Karikaaladu will never die
Buzz off!

02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:14.200
Jesus was crucified!
Didn't he rise from death?

02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:17.550
There isn't anybody
who can kill Kaala!

02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:19.670
This is Kaala's fort!

02:32:19.850 --> 02:32:21.210
One tight slap!

02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:23.800
The question of Kaala's death
doesn't rise in their minds

02:32:23.820 --> 02:32:25.330
'After all this
with the support of the Govt....'

02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:27.080
'and using his power...'
