Oh, Discord, I've never known
anypony as funny as you.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.280
I love that story about the
time you tried to train

fetch your left leg!

00:20.687 --> 00:24.088
Oh, I do love our Tuesday Teas.

00:24.090 --> 00:26.624
And I can't wait for you to
meet my friend, Tree Hugger.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.327
She's going to love you, too.

00:29.329 --> 00:33.364
Tree Hugger? Ah ha ha!

00:33.366 --> 00:35.666
I met her on a trip
to see the Breezies.

Equestrian Society

We're all going to have
so much fun together

00:45.745 --> 00:47.445
at the Grand Galloping Gala!

I'd love to!

asked Tree Hugger.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.293
I'm sorry, Discord.

01:02.295 --> 01:04.228
I assumed you'd have
your own ticket

Celestia are friends now.

didn't want to go,

around and around and I couldn't

about to just go by myself
