00:16.449 --> 00:19.543
When I had her at State --
That didn't sound right.

00:19.619 --> 00:22.884
I never had her.
I wanted her, but never had her.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.288
What I meant was
when I took her class.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.850
I had the worst case
of writer's block in the world.

00:28.928 --> 00:32.625
All I had were terrible ideas.
I hated them all.

I was just about
to drop the class

00:34.701 --> 00:40.537
when she said something to me
that changed everything.

00:42.642 --> 00:47.511
She said, "Terrible ideas
are like playground scapegoats.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.777
Given the right encouragement,
they grow up to be geniuses."

00:50.850 --> 00:54.684
She told me to take one,

Well, I did.

-Not so well.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.466
But the procrastination
is coming along fabulously.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.939
Soon it will breed
abject self-loathing,

01:58.451 --> 02:01.852
I met him recently,
sort of by coincidence.

02:01.921 --> 02:06.415
The other coincidence is that
you reviewed a book of mine.

of other critics who loved it.

02:18.004 --> 02:21.098
And I really hope
you didn't take it personally.

02:21.174 --> 02:25.133
You called my lead character
"unrealistic."

I just got off the phone
with your husband's attorney,

03:40.453 --> 03:44.082
and they're going to
pursue alimony.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.126
How can we be talking
about alimony

03:48.194 --> 03:51.595
when I hardly make enough money?

03:51.664 --> 03:54.462
But you supported him
during the marriage.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.660
Yes.

But while he was researching
and writing his book,

His attorney indicated
your husband

04:09.749 --> 04:11.944
would prefer an alimony buy-out.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.215
Since you two were living
rather modestly,

04:15.288 --> 04:17.882
I don't think
the number should be too bad.

04:17.957 --> 04:24.123
They're probably talking about
something like $200,000.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.687
I don't have that money.

Unfortunately, you do.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.362
The house?

04:30.436 --> 04:34.372
Its value went through the roof
since you bought it.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.005
And renovated it
with my mother's money.

04:38.077 --> 04:42.309
Well, it's all
community property now.

04:44.317 --> 04:49.380
So he gets
half the house and alimony.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.947
There's leeway, and we'll make
all the arguments we can.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.518
But there is a bargaining chip.
He wants the house.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.963
-He wants to keep living there?
-Yeah.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.160
And if you let him have it,

you could end up with
a lot of money in your pocket.

pretty badly.

05:09.175 --> 05:12.838

there is a section of the Alps
called the Semmering.

46:15.939 --> 46:19.636
It is an impossibly steep,
very high part of the mountains.

46:19.710 --> 46:22.042
They built a train track
over these Alps

46:22.112 --> 46:24.171
to connect Vienna and Venice.

46:24.248 --> 46:28.014
They built these tracks before
there was a train in existence

46:28.085 --> 46:30.076
that could make the trip.

46:31.722 --> 46:37.126
They built it because they knew
someday the train would come.
