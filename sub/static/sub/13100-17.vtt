'There's the legacy
of your war.'

00:06.250 --> 00:09.250
The price we paid
when you abandoned us

00:09.333 --> 00:12.125
to the enemies
you escaped from.

00:12.208 --> 00:15.125
[panting]
But this couldn't happen

00:15.208 --> 00:17.083
not in this amount of time.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.333
What year is this?

00:20.417 --> 00:21.958
This is the last year..

00:23.000 --> 00:24.125
...and the last day

00:24.208 --> 00:27.542
and the last hour
of your life.

00:40.042 --> 00:41.542
I am tired.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.792
Take him back to his cell.

00:46.833 --> 00:48.958
And, Sheridan..

00:49.042 --> 00:50.167
...make your peace

00:50.250 --> 00:53.000
with whatever Gods you worship.

00:53.083 --> 00:56.375
You will meet them
next time I send for you.

00:56.458 --> 00:57.875
'I cannot recall my world'

00:57.958 --> 00:59.458
from what it has become.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.833
But I can thank you properly

01:02.917 --> 01:04.833
for your role in it.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.125
[dramatic music]

01:12.542 --> 01:14.583
How long until the scanners
are back online?

01:14.667 --> 01:17.417
Oh, we figure another hour,
hour and a half.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.125
Any word on that explosion?

01:19.208 --> 01:21.292
MaintBot reports
are coming in right now.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.250
It's definitely
thermonuclear in origin.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.375
Alright, I want every inch
of that blast area searched

01:26.458 --> 01:28.500
and double all patrols
inside the station

01:28.583 --> 01:31.333
in case anyone tries
to breach the hull.

01:33.125 --> 01:34.458
(Ivanova)
'We need to find
an access panel.'

01:34.542 --> 01:35.667
Usually they're sealed up

01:35.750 --> 01:37.042
once the station goes
operational.

01:37.125 --> 01:38.500
This place just went online

01:38.583 --> 01:41.167
So, with any luck, there should
be a couple still open.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.167
Sorry,
I don't believe in luck.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.333
Well, luck's about
the only thing

01:44.417 --> 01:45.750
we've got on our side right now.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.875
Sure as hell don't have much
of anything else.

01:50.792 --> 01:54.083
Marcus? Oh, hell.

01:54.167 --> 01:55.583
Freeze!

(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was our
last, best hope for peace.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.417
It failed.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.958
[dramatic music]

02:26.375 --> 02:28.167
(Ivanova)
But in the year
of the Shadow war

02:28.250 --> 02:30.500
it became something greater

02:30.583 --> 02:34.208
our last, best hope
for victory.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.958
The year is 2260.

02:41.042 --> 02:43.958

[door opens]

03:39.208 --> 03:41.833
- What was that?
- What was what?

[grunts]

03:45.208 --> 03:47.042
[groans]

03:47.125 --> 03:48.792
You said move!
How'd you know they were coming?

03:48.875 --> 03:51.500
Didn't, but right now would be
the worst time to be discovered

03:51.583 --> 03:54.375
so it was logical
that it would happen now.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.958
Like I said,
I don't believe in luck.

04:01.583 --> 04:02.875
On the other hand..

04:17.875 --> 04:22.833
Carry this, Zathras.
Fix this, Zathras.

04:22.917 --> 04:27.750
Poor Zathras.
No one listen to Zathras.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.167
In fact no one.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.000
[dramatic music]

04:34.625 --> 04:36.000
Hmm?

04:39.250 --> 04:40.417
Oh.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.583
Oh..

04:44.583 --> 04:47.208
[indistinct chatter]

04:50.917 --> 04:54.875
This will do. But we'll need
to clear the place out first.

04:54.958 --> 04:58.417
- 'Team one to team two. Ready?'
- Ready. Stand by.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.542
Alright, let's see
if this works.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.583
[gasps]

05:02.667 --> 05:03.958
What is it?

05:04.042 --> 05:07.458
I'm not sure.
It was the strangest feeling.

05:07.542 --> 05:10.167
I think the way
you describe it is..

05:10.250 --> 05:13.250
...as if someone
had just walked over my grave.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.250
[Sheridan groans]

'John? John?'

05:28.125 --> 05:30.042
- Delenn!
- John.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.250
Delenn..

05:35.333 --> 05:36.792
...what are you doing here?

05:36.875 --> 05:38.417
I didn't tell them anything.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.917
They tried to make me,
but I didn't.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.708
There's nothing
they can do to me.

05:42.792 --> 05:45.417
They know that now,
so they say they're allowing us

05:45.500 --> 05:47.625
one last moment
together before..

05:48.625 --> 05:49.875
What?

05:49.958 --> 05:52.208
It's alright, John.

05:52.292 --> 05:54.542
I accepted this fate
a long time ago.

05:55.917 --> 05:57.833
They cannot harm me.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.375
I'm not afraid.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.792
Not if you are with me.

06:02.917 --> 06:05.083
- Our son is safe.
- Son?

06:05.167 --> 06:07.458
That's all that matters.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.333
John, I love you.

06:12.542 --> 06:15.042
[instrumental music]

06:21.792 --> 06:23.750
[alarm blaring]

06:23.833 --> 06:25.667
That's got it.
Let's go.

'Hull breach in this area.'

06:30.500 --> 06:32.792
- 'Evacuate immediately.'
- 'Come on, let's go!'

(woman on PA)
'Pressure doors dropping.'

06:35.667 --> 06:38.125
[alarm blaring]

06:40.833 --> 06:42.292
Pressure doors are down,
we've got this area

06:42.375 --> 06:44.125
completely to ourselves
till they can burn through.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.542
- Figure about an hour.
- It'll do.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.417
- Let's get the equipment.
- Alright.

06:49.708 --> 06:53.458
Delenn honey, just listen to me.

06:53.542 --> 06:54.792
This may not make any sense

06:54.875 --> 06:57.125
but I am not supposed
to be here.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.792
I'm not really here.

07:01.250 --> 07:05.833
The last thing I remember,
I was on the White Star

07:05.917 --> 07:08.333
and-and my time stabilizer
was hit and..

07:10.458 --> 07:12.625
...suddenly I was here.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.375
In Valen's name..

07:15.250 --> 07:17.458
...it's true, isn't it?

07:17.542 --> 07:19.375
I can see it
in your eyes.

07:20.917 --> 07:22.708
You told me long ago

07:22.792 --> 07:26.750
that you had seen this moment in
our future, but until now, I..

07:27.583 --> 07:29.333
I never really believed.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.292
John..

07:33.958 --> 07:36.583
...there's so much
ahead of you.

07:36.667 --> 07:40.833
So many changes,
so much pain and grief.

07:42.375 --> 07:46.208
I look in your eyes now,
and I see the innocence

07:46.292 --> 07:49.125
that went away
so many years ago.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.500
But then, you don't know

07:54.583 --> 07:56.875
any of what's happened,
do you?

07:57.750 --> 08:00.417
I...I...I..

08:02.583 --> 08:04.833
From what Londo said..

08:04.917 --> 08:07.458
...I get the impression
that we won the war..

08:09.167 --> 08:11.083
...but not completely.

08:11.167 --> 08:14.167
The war is never
completely won.

08:14.250 --> 08:18.292
There are always new battles to
be fought against the darkness.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.167
Only the names change.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.250
But we, we achieved everything

08:24.333 --> 08:26.250
we set out to achieve.

08:26.333 --> 08:30.042
We created something that will
endure for a thousand years.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.917
But the price, John..

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
...the terrible,
terrible price.

08:40.042 --> 08:43.708
I didn't think I would see you
again before the end.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.250
Now, Delenn..

08:47.333 --> 08:49.750
...is there anything that
I can do to prevent this?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.250
I mean,
there's still a chance.

08:51.333 --> 08:54.292
No, this future
can only be changed

08:54.375 --> 08:56.167
by surrendering
to the Shadows

08:56.250 --> 08:58.958
and that price
is too high to pay.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.792
But we have a son?

09:03.875 --> 09:06.792
Yes. We have David.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.167
- David?
- David.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.583
(male #1)
Out! Now!

09:11.667 --> 09:14.125
[instrumental music]

09:35.750 --> 09:37.958
[instrumental music]

10:01.167 --> 10:03.458
(Londo)
Close enough.

10:03.542 --> 10:07.125
You will excuse me
if I do not stand.

10:07.208 --> 10:11.708
I have had
considerable to drink.

10:11.792 --> 10:12.875
It is..

10:14.500 --> 10:19.333
...the only way
that we can be alone.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.833
We do not wish to wake it.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.292
Wake what?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.333
Then you do not know.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.542
You cannot see it
while it is awake.

10:33.167 --> 10:37.042
We all have our keepers,
you see.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.958
I gave a very good
performance.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.708
Yes.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.917
It was satisfied.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.875
Doesn't care
why I do what I do..

10:53.500 --> 10:55.667
...as long as I do it.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.250
As long as you are dead.

11:08.083 --> 11:11.542
It cannot hold
its liquor, you see.

11:11.625 --> 11:14.583
[chuckles]
'I have learned'

11:14.667 --> 11:17.417
that if I drink just enough

11:17.500 --> 11:21.833
I can put it to sleep
for a few minutes.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.917
A few minutes where

11:26.000 --> 11:29.958
I am in charge of myself again.

11:32.167 --> 11:36.750
But the few minutes have been
growing shorter and shorter.

11:36.833 --> 11:40.042
So, we do not have much time.

11:40.708 --> 11:43.083
[coughing]

11:51.333 --> 11:55.208
My life...is almost over.

11:59.333 --> 12:03.458
My world, all I hoped for, gone.

12:05.542 --> 12:09.750
You two...are my last chance..

12:12.042 --> 12:14.583
...for this place..

12:14.667 --> 12:16.500
...for my people..

12:18.333 --> 12:20.625
...for my own redemption.

12:21.917 --> 12:26.125
'There is a ship
hidden behind the palace.'

12:27.292 --> 12:29.667
My guard will take you there.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.917
In exchange
for your lives..

12:36.042 --> 12:39.708
...all I ask is that you
and your allies..

12:41.042 --> 12:44.083
...help to free my people.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.583
I can do nothing more for them.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.667
'Go now.'

12:59.083 --> 13:00.333
'Quickly.'

13:01.500 --> 13:03.667
You do not have much time.

13:03.750 --> 13:08.500
I can...feel it
beginning to wake up.

13:10.292 --> 13:13.958
Hurry. Go on!

13:15.042 --> 13:17.708
[Londo coughing]

13:35.958 --> 13:37.917
You are there,
my old friend?

13:38.667 --> 13:40.125
Yes.

13:43.625 --> 13:48.333
They will never
make it out alive, unless..

13:51.792 --> 13:56.417
You see, my keeper
will awaken any second

13:56.500 --> 13:59.750
and it will alert the others.

13:59.833 --> 14:03.250
And my only hope will die..

14:03.333 --> 14:05.917
'...and I will die soon after.'

14:07.292 --> 14:11.250
They do not take
betrayal lightly.

14:16.583 --> 14:20.750
We have unfinished business
between us, G'Kar.

14:23.792 --> 14:26.667
Let us make
an end of it quickly..

14:27.792 --> 14:29.792
...before it stops me.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.458
I am as tired of my life
as you are.

[groans]

15:03.292 --> 15:06.417
What is it? What is it?

15:06.500 --> 15:08.292
I'm being pulled back again.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.208
Then take these words
back with you to the past.

15:11.292 --> 15:12.917
Treasure the moments you have.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.750
Savor them
for as long as you can

15:14.833 --> 15:17.417
for they will
never come back again.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.833
John, listen to me

15:18.917 --> 15:20.833
do not go to Z'ha'dum.

15:20.917 --> 15:24.375
Do you understand?
Do not go to Z'ha'dum!

15:24.458 --> 15:25.917
Aah!

15:30.667 --> 15:33.250
[instrumental music]

[instrumental music]

16:00.542 --> 16:02.042
(Marcus)
Do you think you could
lend us a hand?

16:02.125 --> 16:04.708
Uh, no. Very, very busy.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.333
Zathras has idea.

16:06.417 --> 16:09.625
Saw him, Zathras did,
so Zathras thinks

16:09.708 --> 16:12.542
perhaps power supply in suit

16:12.625 --> 16:15.792
will help activate
time stabilizer.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.667
Will not last though.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.708
Then he will be lost again.

16:20.958 --> 16:23.000
There! Finished.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.333
Now we wait.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.750
[grunts]

16:32.583 --> 16:34.458
He's quite mad, you know.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.333
He actually thinks
that Sheridan's gonna

16:36.417 --> 16:37.708
materialize in there.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.625
Marcus, we're stealing a station
to fight in a war

16:39.708 --> 16:41.042
that was over
a 1000 years ago.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.000
We're all mad.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.583
You know, I've been thinking,
Delenn said that

16:44.667 --> 16:45.917
'their great leader, Valen'

16:46.000 --> 16:47.292
came forward
at about the same time.

16:47.375 --> 16:49.000
And Lennier said that
Valen was Minbari

16:49.083 --> 16:50.792
not born of Minbari.
It's always intrigued me.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.417
You think we'll get a chance
to meet him?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.333
I don't know,
it'd be an honor though.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.417
He's one of their
holiest figures.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.125
Defeated the Shadows,
formed the Grey Council.

17:03.208 --> 17:04.875
Captain?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
No one ever listens to Zathras.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.042
"Quite mad," they say.

17:12.125 --> 17:14.542
It is good
that Zathras does not mind.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.625
He's even grown to like it.
Oh, yes.

17:18.792 --> 17:20.917
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.458
- Ah!
- Are you alright?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.625
[panting]

17:24.708 --> 17:26.750
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.333
[groans]
Feel like I could drift away
any second

17:29.417 --> 17:32.167
but yeah, I'm okay.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.792
Where's Sinclair?

17:33.875 --> 17:36.750
Right here. Welcome back.

17:36.833 --> 17:39.000
- How was your trip?
- I'm not sure.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.458
I'm gonna have to
think about this for a while.

17:40.542 --> 17:41.958
What's our status?

17:42.042 --> 17:44.125
We've secured a path
to the central power core.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.292
We're ready to proceed.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.083
Alright. Then let's do it.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.458
John! John!

17:50.542 --> 17:52.000
John, are you alright?

17:52.083 --> 17:57.125
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine. No. No!

17:57.208 --> 17:59.125
What is it?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.458
Oh, it's a long story.

18:01.542 --> 18:03.000
I'll have to tell you later.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.083
- Go on. Go on.
- Yes. Yes.

18:11.417 --> 18:14.458
(Sheridan)
Moving the last piece
into the central power core.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.750
Must being very careful.

18:17.833 --> 18:20.500
Time-jump system,
very delicate.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.875
When finished,
station will be stabilized

18:23.958 --> 18:26.000
for time travel.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.625
Captain, I just finished
rigging the scanners on B4

18:28.708 --> 18:30.583
to detect a phony alert
in the fusion reactor.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.667
It'll make it look like the
whole place is going critical.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.458
'I should encourage the crew
to evacuate'

18:34.542 --> 18:35.875
'so we can move this thing.'

18:35.958 --> 18:37.958
(Sheridan)
Roger that.

18:38.042 --> 18:41.833
Major, we have a 20 percent
energy drop in the power core.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.167
Increase output.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.542
Sir, the system hasn't been
fully checked out yet--

18:45.625 --> 18:48.167
I know what I'm doing,
lieutenant. Punch it!

18:48.250 --> 18:51.708
We can't afford a brownout
if we've got hostiles aboard.

18:54.375 --> 18:57.042
[crackling]

18:57.125 --> 19:00.042
We're picking up a surge
of tachyon particles!

19:00.125 --> 19:01.708
It's comin'..

19:02.583 --> 19:04.750
[dramatic music]

19:10.625 --> 19:12.667
[instrumental music]

19:16.042 --> 19:17.208
Zathras!

19:17.292 --> 19:18.833
Zathras know!

19:18.917 --> 19:22.375
Zathras working.
Not Zathras fault.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.750
[Zathras panting]

19:28.042 --> 19:30.167
Ah-ha! This works!

19:30.250 --> 19:32.667
Stopping now!

19:38.333 --> 19:40.000
What the hell was that?

19:40.083 --> 19:43.167
Unknown. Time-track system
shot all to hell.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.542
We're surrounded by some kind
of tachyon distortion field.

19:46.625 --> 19:49.083
- Is everyone okay?
- Yes.

19:49.167 --> 19:51.583
Yes, I think so.
What happened?

19:51.667 --> 19:54.917
Time device activated
prematurely.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.417
Not good. Malfunction.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.833
So where are we?

19:58.917 --> 20:02.750
Readings indicate we have
moved four years ahead.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.750
Which is exactly when Babylon 4
reappeared the last time.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.167
Well, so far
everything's happening

20:07.250 --> 20:08.417
exactly the way it did before

20:08.500 --> 20:09.625
whether we want it to or not.

20:09.708 --> 20:13.542
Danger though.
Time system is not stable.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.042
Very delicate.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.667
Must adjust
before we try again

20:17.750 --> 20:20.958
or become forever
lost in time.

20:21.042 --> 20:22.958
- Very dangerous.
- Great.

20:23.042 --> 20:24.958
Doesn't anything come under
warranty anymore?

20:25.708 --> 20:27.375
Ivanova to Sheridan.

20:28.792 --> 20:29.792
Captain?

20:29.875 --> 20:30.958
(Sinclair)
'He's gone again.'

20:31.042 --> 20:32.292
'And you better
get up here.'

20:32.375 --> 20:34.208
'There's been a slight problem.'

20:37.083 --> 20:39.500
Major, the reactor core
has become unstable.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.625
Approaching critical.
It's not gonna last very long.

20:42.708 --> 20:46.292
- We have to evacuate.
- No, not after all this.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.292
Major, if this is
as bad as it sounds

20:49.375 --> 20:50.792
we could lose
the whole station.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.083
We have nearly
2,000 workers on board.

20:53.167 --> 20:55.708
And you don't wanna jeopardize
their safety.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.625
If it's safe,
we can come back.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.500
But if it's not..

21:01.875 --> 21:03.958
Alright.
Send out a distress signal--

21:04.042 --> 21:05.750
We got another
tachyon burst!

21:18.083 --> 21:20.583
[instrumental music]

21:43.750 --> 21:45.542
(Delenn)
'Hello.'

21:54.875 --> 21:55.958
Delenn, are you--

21:56.042 --> 21:58.083
I'm alright.
What was that?

21:58.167 --> 22:02.833
Time flash. See yourself forward
or backward in time.

22:02.917 --> 22:06.667
Zathras told you,
system unstable.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.542
Jeff! My, God!
What-what happened?

22:09.625 --> 22:10.917
What was bound
to happen as soon as

22:11.000 --> 22:13.167
we went forward in time again.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.667
When Garibaldi and I
came to Babylon 4 the last time

22:15.750 --> 22:17.583
we passed through
the time distortion field

22:17.667 --> 22:19.292
without any kind
of protection.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.417
I always wondered if it would
have any long-term effects

22:21.500 --> 22:23.208
if we were exposed
to the field again.

22:23.292 --> 22:24.750
That's why I didn't
want him along.

22:24.833 --> 22:26.625
But we can fix it, right?
I mean, uh..

22:26.708 --> 22:28.250
You're not gonna keep getting
older the closer we get

22:28.333 --> 22:29.875
to our own time, are you?

22:32.292 --> 22:33.667
Is he?

22:33.750 --> 22:37.583
Zathras does not know
for certain, but..

22:38.417 --> 22:40.875
...is good chance, yes.

22:40.958 --> 22:43.000
Either way, we can't stop
to worry about this now.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.500
We've got a job to finish.

22:44.583 --> 22:47.083
Sheridan disappeared again
just as the field went up.

22:47.167 --> 22:49.500
If we don't get him back soon
we may lose him permanently.

22:49.583 --> 22:52.250
Is there any way you can fix
his time stabilizer?

22:52.333 --> 22:57.000
I have components,
but...need equipment.

22:57.083 --> 23:00.042
Delicate, careful work.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.250
I saw a work area
when we were out earlier.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.542
Maybe they've got
what you need there.

23:03.625 --> 23:05.750
- Then get going.
- Come on.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.417
I'll go back into
the power core

23:08.500 --> 23:09.792
and try to readjust
the equipment

23:09.875 --> 23:11.167
and see if we can stabilize
this place.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.667
Marcus, I'll need
you and the rest to stay

23:12.750 --> 23:14.208
with the White Star
and monitor the readings.

23:14.292 --> 23:15.458
Tell me when it's ready.

23:15.542 --> 23:16.958
We've got one last shot at this.

23:17.042 --> 23:18.875
Let's make the best of it.

23:21.583 --> 23:23.083
No, no, no, no, no.

23:23.167 --> 23:24.583
Not good. No--

23:24.667 --> 23:26.167
Come on, come on,
find what you need

23:26.250 --> 23:28.792
and let's get out of here.
We're running out of time.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.875
Cannot run out of time.

23:30.958 --> 23:33.375
There is infinite time.

23:33.458 --> 23:37.458
You are finite,
Zathras is finite

23:37.542 --> 23:40.500
this is wrong tool.

23:40.583 --> 23:44.125
No. No, not good. No.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.292
No. Never use this.

23:46.375 --> 23:47.583
(Sinclair)
'How does it look?'

23:47.667 --> 23:49.375
Readings are still unstable. I..

23:49.458 --> 23:51.958
[beeping]

23:53.583 --> 23:55.000
Ambassador Sinclair

23:55.083 --> 23:57.500
I'm picking something up
on the external scanners.

23:57.583 --> 24:01.208
I'm reading six. No, seven
ships coming this way.

24:01.292 --> 24:03.125
(Sinclair)
I was wondering
when they'd get here.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.708
- Who's on board?
- 'I am.'

24:05.792 --> 24:07.000
(Sinclair)
'That's me and Garibaldi.'

24:07.083 --> 24:08.875
'when we came here
two years ago, our time'

24:08.958 --> 24:12.125
'to answer a distress call
from Babylon 4.'

24:18.333 --> 24:21.542
Shuttle one to escort wing,
take position 2.5 kilometers

24:21.625 --> 24:23.042
from the station and hold.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.292
We'll go in
and check it out first.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.750
Once we know it's clear,
we'll signal you

24:25.833 --> 24:27.542
to proceed with the evacuation.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.875
Let's do it.

24:28.958 --> 24:31.500
[dramatic music]

24:41.792 --> 24:44.292
[metal clanking]

24:48.125 --> 24:49.792
Ah!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.667
[beeping]

24:59.667 --> 25:01.000
Ah!

25:02.333 --> 25:04.542
[alarm blaring]

25:08.458 --> 25:10.417
Ah! Hello.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.667
[clicks tongue]

25:17.708 --> 25:20.208
I am Zathras.

25:20.292 --> 25:23.333
Zathras got here
by being Zathras.

25:23.417 --> 25:26.750
Zathras wants nothing,
so Zathras gets nothing.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.042
'That is life.'

25:29.125 --> 25:31.375
We got a problem, people.
They've got Zathras.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.583
- How are the repairs going?
- Slowly.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.417
We may have it
in another couple of hours.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.167
(Ivanova)
'It's too long. What if I can
adjust the power from C-and-C?'

25:38.250 --> 25:39.833
Great idea,
if you can get there.

25:39.917 --> 25:41.792
(Ivanova)
'I can do it,
I just got to be careful.'

25:41.875 --> 25:43.375
I've got company.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.750
It started 24 hours after
the station went operational.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.375
We began noticing discrepancies
in the time-track system.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.792
We thought
it was a computer glitch

25:50.875 --> 25:52.417
then all hell broke loose.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.542
Anything else unusual happened
before the station vanished?

25:55.625 --> 25:57.667
Yeah. This.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.250
Says his name is Zathras.

26:18.333 --> 26:20.292
'We don't know how he got
aboard, where he came from'

26:20.375 --> 26:21.708
'or what race he is.'

26:21.792 --> 26:23.750
'I've never seen an alien
like him before.'

26:26.167 --> 26:27.458
Oh!

26:30.417 --> 26:32.167
Oh..

26:32.250 --> 26:35.958
Oh! Not the one. No.

26:37.417 --> 26:39.708
- Not the one, what?
- Not the one.

26:39.792 --> 26:41.500
Won't talk. Can't talk.

26:41.583 --> 26:42.875
Not the one.

26:42.958 --> 26:44.667
They told me. They did.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.333
Zathras listens.
He does, yes.

26:46.417 --> 26:48.917
Zathras listens
and does what he is told.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.833
Okay, everybody,
let's get out.

26:51.917 --> 26:54.042
We're evacuating
the station.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.167
But, lieutenant,
if we leave--

26:55.250 --> 26:56.583
I set the system
on automatic.

26:56.667 --> 26:59.333
We can run the entire evacuation
from the docking bay.

26:59.417 --> 27:00.958
Let's move out. Move out!

27:02.417 --> 27:04.542
[alarm blaring]

27:14.708 --> 27:17.208
Okay, I'm in. Here goes.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.542
[beeping]

27:21.625 --> 27:24.417
Zathras warn, but no, no.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.292
No one listen
to poor Zathras. No.

27:27.375 --> 27:28.750
[clicks tongue]

27:28.833 --> 27:30.708
(Zathras)
'A great war'

27:30.792 --> 27:34.542
but great hope of peace.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.875
Need place

27:37.958 --> 27:41.958
'place to gather,
to fight, to organize.'

27:42.042 --> 27:44.167
You need Babylon 4
as a base of operations

27:44.250 --> 27:45.708
in a war, is that it?

27:45.792 --> 27:47.625
[clicks tongue]

27:48.542 --> 27:51.292
To help save galaxy

27:51.375 --> 27:53.542
on the side of light.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.833
So they tell me..

27:56.792 --> 27:58.583
...must have..

27:58.667 --> 28:00.625
or it is the end of all.

28:01.875 --> 28:03.250
The one leads us.

28:04.667 --> 28:07.250
The one tells us to go.
We go.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.792
[dramatic music]

28:13.833 --> 28:15.500
Major! It's back!

28:15.583 --> 28:17.042
Oh, no!

28:23.667 --> 28:25.333
There it is again.

28:25.417 --> 28:27.250
(Sinclair)
'What the hell?'

28:30.708 --> 28:32.542
Ah! Ah.

28:34.167 --> 28:36.125
It is the one.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.042
Okay, that should do it.
I've got control of the core.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.458
If you're finished down there,
back off

28:39.542 --> 28:40.875
'cause I'm gonna
start her up.

28:40.958 --> 28:43.292
(Sinclair)
Roger that. Heading in.

28:47.042 --> 28:48.792
Commander, don't.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.083
[groans]

29:11.542 --> 29:13.833
Fixed.
Zathras fixed.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.792
Take. Hurry.

29:17.667 --> 29:18.833
[beeps]

29:20.583 --> 29:22.458
You must leave now.

29:22.542 --> 29:24.083
Finished, we are.

29:24.167 --> 29:26.083
There is no more time.

29:26.167 --> 29:29.167
Leave or be trapped here
forever.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.833
[instrumental music]

29:40.708 --> 29:42.583
[groans]

29:44.958 --> 29:47.208
- What are you--
- I don't know.

29:47.292 --> 29:50.083
The last thing I remember
was appearing here

29:50.167 --> 29:55.042
a little while ago
then...then I passed out.

29:56.917 --> 29:58.708
(Marcus)
'He must have fixed it.'

29:58.792 --> 30:01.208
No, no.
This isn't my stabilizer.

30:01.292 --> 30:03.375
There's no sign of damage.

30:06.083 --> 30:08.250
Someone must have
put this on me.

30:08.958 --> 30:11.208
Switched places.

30:11.292 --> 30:13.083
But if you're here

30:13.167 --> 30:16.167
then who's running around
out there in a blue suit?

30:16.250 --> 30:18.292
[dramatic music]

30:26.292 --> 30:27.625
- We've gotta help him!
- Too late!

30:27.708 --> 30:29.000
We've gotta get out of here!

30:29.083 --> 30:31.542
- We can't leave him.
- You think I want to?

30:31.625 --> 30:33.792
We have to leave now,
with or without you.

30:33.875 --> 30:37.500
- Go!
- Go now! Leave me!

30:37.583 --> 30:38.917
I can't.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.250
Go! You must listen to Zathras.

30:43.333 --> 30:46.792
You have a destiny.

30:47.583 --> 30:48.958
'Go!'

30:49.042 --> 30:50.667
Please!

30:50.750 --> 30:52.458
Go for Zathras.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.167
[thunder rumbling]

30:59.917 --> 31:02.417
[instrumental music]

31:20.708 --> 31:22.125
Babylon 4 to Garibaldi.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.958
Babylon 4 to shuttle one.

31:24.042 --> 31:25.667
Garibaldi, do you read me?

31:25.750 --> 31:28.417
Watch your back, Michael.
Watch your back.

31:28.500 --> 31:33.792
(woman on radio)
'Target is outside communication
range. Unable to make contact.'

31:33.875 --> 31:35.458
Michael..

31:49.083 --> 31:50.375
[exhales]

31:54.167 --> 31:55.750
Oh..

31:59.375 --> 32:01.458
Zathras knew..

32:01.542 --> 32:03.833
...you would not leave him.

32:04.875 --> 32:08.167
'Zathras trusts the one.'

32:18.458 --> 32:20.917
[dramatic music]

32:30.917 --> 32:32.542
I tried.

32:32.625 --> 32:34.333
I tried to warn them..

32:35.208 --> 32:37.000
...but it all happened

32:37.083 --> 32:39.500
just the way I remembered.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.083
I know.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.958
It's time.
We have to go.

32:44.042 --> 32:46.167
They're waiting for us.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.542
I've finished integrating
the time-shifting controls

32:59.625 --> 33:01.625
'so they can be adjusted
from here. It's ready to go.'

33:01.708 --> 33:04.792
Good. The rest of you
head on back to the White Star.

33:04.875 --> 33:06.625
I'll set it off,
then come join you.

33:06.708 --> 33:08.125
(Marcus)
'Entil'Zha..'

33:08.208 --> 33:11.625
...you always said half a truth
was worse than a lie.

33:11.708 --> 33:12.875
Don't disappoint me.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.667
I don't know
what you're talking about?

33:14.750 --> 33:16.042
You've kept us
going so fast

33:16.125 --> 33:17.708
we haven't had time to think.

33:17.792 --> 33:20.667
But this system isn't
fully automatic, is it?

33:20.750 --> 33:22.042
'Someone has to ride this thing'

33:22.125 --> 33:24.292
back into the distant past.

33:24.375 --> 33:26.083
and it's a one-way ticket,
isn't it?

33:26.167 --> 33:29.042
Whoever goes
isn't coming back.

33:30.292 --> 33:31.708
Is this true?

33:35.458 --> 33:38.542
Fine. I'll take her out.

33:38.625 --> 33:39.917
Marcus..

33:41.333 --> 33:43.583
..I'll take it back
because I've always taken it

33:43.667 --> 33:44.625
and I always will.

33:44.708 --> 33:45.750
It's already happened.

33:45.833 --> 33:46.792
You don't know that.

33:46.875 --> 33:48.375
Yes, I do.

33:48.458 --> 33:50.083
You asked what brought me here.

33:50.167 --> 33:52.458
Before I left Minbar,
I was given a letter

33:52.542 --> 33:54.833
from 900 years ago.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.125
- Whose handwriting is this?
- 'Mine.'

33:59.208 --> 34:02.917
I wrote this from the past.
Nine hundred years ago.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.708
I went.
It's as simple as that.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.083
He's telling the truth.

34:07.167 --> 34:08.750
I received one as well.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.333
No. I-I can't accept this.

34:10.417 --> 34:11.625
If I go back to our time

34:11.708 --> 34:14.042
the aging effect
will probably kill me.

34:14.125 --> 34:15.792
Isn't it better
to choose life?

34:15.875 --> 34:19.167
- Dammit, Jeff, I--
- Susan, it's alright.

34:20.375 --> 34:22.625
My whole life
has been leading to this.

34:24.375 --> 34:27.458
Could you and Marcus
give us a minute here?

34:27.542 --> 34:29.792
There's something
we need to discuss..

34:29.875 --> 34:31.083
...alone.

34:39.042 --> 34:41.958
Zathras, something
I don't understand.

34:42.042 --> 34:43.250
You said you followed the one

34:43.333 --> 34:45.208
but the one you pointed to was--

34:45.292 --> 34:46.583
Was Delenn.

34:46.667 --> 34:50.083
[laughs]
Yes. Zathras knew.

34:50.167 --> 34:54.375
Zathras
is oldest living caretaker

34:54.458 --> 34:59.167
of Great Machine, 110 years old.
Yeah.

34:59.250 --> 35:03.500
Zathras has studied
the Great Machine

35:03.583 --> 35:06.708
knows things even Draal

35:06.792 --> 35:08.875
'does not know yet.'

35:09.625 --> 35:11.750
And I know you.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.792
And I know you.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.917
And I know you.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.583
Hmm.

35:20.667 --> 35:25.208
All Minbari belief
is around three.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.083
Three castes.

35:28.167 --> 35:32.250
Worker, Warrior, Religious.

35:32.333 --> 35:33.750
Three languages.

35:33.833 --> 35:37.208
Light, dark, and grey.

35:37.292 --> 35:40.625
The nine of the Grey Council.

35:41.458 --> 35:44.875
Three times three.

35:44.958 --> 35:47.000
All is three..

35:49.000 --> 35:50.958
..as you are three..

35:51.958 --> 35:54.000
...as you are one..

35:55.833 --> 35:58.208
...as you are..

35:58.292 --> 36:00.375
..The One. Mm.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.792
You are the one who was.

36:05.958 --> 36:09.125
You are the one who is.

36:10.833 --> 36:15.292
And you are the one who will be.

36:15.375 --> 36:18.125
You are the beginning
of the story..

36:18.208 --> 36:21.250
...and the middle of the story..

36:21.333 --> 36:24.417
...and the end of the story..

36:24.500 --> 36:27.917
...that creates
the next great story.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
[clicks tongue]
Ah!

36:32.292 --> 36:34.958
In your heart you know

36:35.042 --> 36:38.750
what Zathras says is true.

36:41.458 --> 36:43.000
Go now!

36:44.167 --> 36:48.792
Zathras' place
is with the one who was.

36:49.917 --> 36:53.792
We have a destiny. Hmm.

37:02.917 --> 37:05.417
[instrumental music]

37:57.875 --> 37:59.708
Stand by to break seal.

38:00.667 --> 38:02.000
'It's what he wants.'

38:02.875 --> 38:04.333
Let's respect it.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.333
Engines at maximum.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.083
Let's go home.

[instrumental music]

38:23.792 --> 38:25.875

38:29.708 --> 38:31.708
Captain, the temporal rift
is closing.

38:33.292 --> 38:34.542
Guess Draal wants to make sure

38:34.625 --> 38:36.333
no one else
gets trapped there.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.333
Yes.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.042
That door is closed forever

38:41.125 --> 38:43.125
and it is not the only one.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.917
Lennier told you
that a 1000 years ago

38:47.000 --> 38:49.667
human and Minbari
souls began to merge.

38:49.750 --> 38:53.417
Minbari souls were being born
in human bodies.

38:53.500 --> 38:58.000
Something happened that opened
that door between us.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.792
My change was, in part,
to even the scales

39:00.875 --> 39:02.750
and restore balance
between our races

39:02.833 --> 39:06.417
using a device my people
discovered a 1000 years ago.

39:07.833 --> 39:09.417
You see..

39:09.500 --> 39:13.792
...if my people had found
Babylon 4 with a human aboard

39:13.875 --> 39:16.292
they would never
have accepted it.

39:19.375 --> 39:23.875
Dear God, a Minbari
not born of Minbari.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.833
(Sinclair)
My whole life has been
leading to this.

39:44.542 --> 39:48.583
Don't you understand?
They're using you.

39:48.667 --> 39:51.042
They're using you!

39:52.667 --> 39:54.750
I knew..

39:54.833 --> 39:56.375
...you would come.

39:56.458 --> 39:57.833
You should rest.

39:59.083 --> 40:00.542
We were right..

40:02.167 --> 40:03.792
...about you.

40:03.875 --> 40:07.542
You talk like a Minbari,
commander.

40:38.583 --> 40:39.917
Good.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Good.

40:41.083 --> 40:44.750
Zathras knew you would come.

40:46.083 --> 40:47.625
This way.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.625
This way.

40:51.708 --> 40:53.833
Phew. Here we go.

41:06.833 --> 41:09.333
[instrumental music]

41:12.875 --> 41:14.208
I welcome you

41:14.292 --> 41:17.542
and present
this place to you as a gift.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.875
I am called Valen

41:19.958 --> 41:22.375

ahead of us.
