00:24.624 --> 00:26.291
Are you sure our boy's
going to show?

00:28.728 --> 00:31.030
This isn't exactly his
neighborhood, Goldie.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.700
This isn't home for us
either, Piper.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.306
Back home this guy is the
biggest of the big baddies.

00:41.308 --> 00:44.676
I know people who wouldn't even
say his name out of fear that
they would lose their firstborn.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.445
Pss.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.647
What kind of name is
rumpelstiltskin anyway.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.582
<i> Alice: Alright, you two -</i>
<i> stay mum.</i>

00:50.584 --> 00:53.252
<i> Here he comes, the</i>
<i> squirrely bugger.</i>

00:55.688 --> 00:58.223
<i> Remember, Piper, dear-</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:01.226
<i> he's expecting a dealer named</i>
<i>hans to give him a piece of the</i>
<i> magic mirror.</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:02.694
<i> And where he goes...</i>

01:02.696 --> 01:04.696
<i> Death's messengers are</i>
<i> never far behind.</i>

01:04.697 --> 01:06.532
Where's hans?

01:06.534 --> 01:08.167
Couldn't make it.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.668
He sent me.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.203
I'm Piper.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.338
Did - did you bring it?

01:13.340 --> 01:14.573
It's nearby.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.542
You fiending, pal?

01:18.478 --> 01:20.345
Careful, Piper.

01:20.347 --> 01:23.749
If you know hans, then you
know why I need it.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.784
-Sure. Sure.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.754
You're running out of juice and
you need a taste of the good
stuff.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.689
Great a magic mirror.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.225
Ground up for?
What do you snort it?

01:33.227 --> 01:34.593
Do you have it ?!

01:35.829 --> 01:36.562
Anything for rumpelstiltskin--

01:36.564 --> 01:38.697
hey sshh!

01:41.201 --> 01:43.202
Sshh!

01:46.372 --> 01:49.341
Don't move.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.143
This is new.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.578
Where is it, huh? Where is it!

01:52.580 --> 01:54.847
I told you, it's nearby.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.684
Alice.

01:58.686 --> 02:02.621
Alice: Piper's fine. Stay put.
I don't want him in that blonde
head of yours, too.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.300
Where did you hear that name?

02:15.401 --> 02:16.869
Hans.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.342
You're lying.

02:24.577 --> 02:27.646
Hans would never tell you that
name. Do you know why?

02:27.780 --> 02:30.816
Because I told him not to.

02:32.352 --> 02:36.688
Just like I can tell you to give
me what I need.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.257
Then do it.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.861
Give it to me now!

02:47.467 --> 02:50.435
Oh, oh.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.503
You lost your juice, pal?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.773
No, no, no, no,
no, no, not now.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.676
Who sent you?

02:57.810 --> 02:58.944
Was it them?

02:59.279 --> 03:01.446
Who is them?

03:01.448 --> 03:04.183
Death: Rumpelstiltskin.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.517
Goldie: Alice something's
happening.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.487
Alice: It's him. Death or one of
his messengers.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.556
Alice: His powers are
gone! After him!

03:10.558 --> 03:12.391
He can't move.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.732
Did you think you could
hide from him?

03:25.772 --> 03:30.209
You were supposed to bring
him the magic mirror.

03:30.443 --> 03:31.577
You broke it.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.245
And you cheated him.

03:33.379 --> 03:37.583
Death doesn't like to be
cheated.

03:37.585 --> 03:42.387
Next time tell him to
read the fine print.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.490
Tell him yourself.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.931
Male #1: Alice, blood.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.939
Curiouser and curiouser.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.243
We've made a delightful mess of
things, haven't we?

04:04.611 --> 04:06.511
Let's not dally, now.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.848
It's through the
looking glass for you.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.921
<i> Is this thing on?</i>

04:15.923 --> 04:18.923
<i>Hats off</i>
<i> to our newly arrived guest.</i>

04:18.926 --> 04:24.997
<i> I'm sure you have oh so many</i>
<i> questions, but for now, a word</i>
<i> of advice:</i>

04:24.999 --> 04:27.966
<i> Don't try too terribly hard to</i>
<i> keep your head</i>

04:27.968 --> 04:30.535
<i> some would say,</i>
<i> to survive here</i>

04:30.537 --> 04:32.904
<i> you'd have to be mad</i>
<i> as a hatter.</i>

04:32.906 --> 04:35.707
Most people think me quite mad.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.609
Monsters and magic.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.845
Uncommon nonsense they say.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.314
Perhaps I am mad.

04:42.316 --> 04:46.518
Why sometimes I've believed as
many as 6 impossible things
before breakfast.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.919
But...

04:49.289 --> 04:54.960
I've seen wonder. Mad or not,
you're quite real.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.629
Someone needs to make sure
you're not being naughty.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.932
After all, it was you who
turned the fabric of reality

05:00.934 --> 05:05.337
into something not unlike
Swiss cheese, I'm afraid.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.373
So sorry you're unable to
speak.

05:08.375 --> 05:12.911
I prefer to be absolutely
certain you've lost your powers
of persuasion,

05:12.913 --> 05:15.614
before loosening up that silver
tongue of yours.

05:15.616 --> 05:19.351
<i>A</i>
<i> reminder, dear Alice, our good</i>
<i> Piper's just returned</i>

05:19.353 --> 05:21.887
<i>from a jaunt at the zoo and he's</i>
<i> brought a guest.</i>

05:21.889 --> 05:24.389
<i> And miss goldilocks</i>
<i> stepped out for her date.</i>

05:24.391 --> 05:29.761
<i> When she returns we'll be near</i>
<i> to bursting and all before</i>
<i> tea time!</i>

05:29.896 --> 05:35.100
<i> Seeing as your restraint, I'm</i>
<i> sure he needn't tell you but</i>
<i> keep</i>

05:35.102 --> 05:40.038
<i> your appendages appended by</i>
<i> keeping them to yourself.</i>

05:40.040 --> 05:44.543
<i> Else they're likely to be bit</i>
<i> off by what's behind</i>
<i> below.</i>

05:44.545 --> 05:46.645
Alice: Your new cellmate,
as it were.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.815
This big baddie was our first
recruit.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.750
That's a good Wolfie.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.719
First of many!

05:55.788 --> 05:57.656
<i>Before I</i>
<i> remember, will one of the</i>
<i> tweedles</i>

05:57.658 --> 06:00.058
<i> please forget to give the good</i>
<i> doggie a proper housing?</i>

06:00.927 --> 06:04.830
<i> That little lemon's gone</i>
<i> a tadripe.</i>

06:06.099 --> 06:07.799
As you can see,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.902
your meddling's brought all
sorts of grim beasties

06:10.904 --> 06:14.072
and monsters from your
world to mine.

06:15.942 --> 06:19.378
Unfortunately, you also let
something else in.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.480
Something worse.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.684
Alice: A cult. Armed, trained
working for death himself.

06:25.686 --> 06:29.421
Death's messengers.
I think you know them.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.690
Judging by your friend in the
alleyway.

06:31.692 --> 06:35.627
Alice: They're planning
something and it's up to us to
stop them.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.062
I'll be clear.

06:39.499 --> 06:43.402
Whether I allow you to speak or
not depends entirely on what
you're willing to say.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.138
Alice: Tell me everything you
know about these messengers.

06:46.140 --> 06:51.042
If you cooperate I can make your
stay here a tad more
comfortable.

06:51.944 --> 06:56.515
Perhaps even you won't have to
eat through a straw for the rest
of your life, hmm?

06:57.116 --> 07:01.553
Otherwise, breaking the magic
mirror will bring you more than

07:01.555 --> 07:04.022
just seven years bad
luck, I'm afraid.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.891
Alice: We'll keep rounding
up monsters.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.894
You can decide whether you
want to be one or not.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.997
Blink twice if you've
understood me.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.601
And blink twice if we
have a deal.

07:19.672 --> 07:20.872
Hmm.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.976
Suit yourself.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.713
I'll leave you to think
about it.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.826
Piper: You sure you want to go
alone, Goldie?

07:43.229 --> 07:43.228
Golding: He's expecting an
escort.

07:43.230 --> 07:47.732
I don't want him running off
before I have a chance to take
him in.

07:49.702 --> 07:55.106
Piper: I don't think this guy
scares easily. You'd be lucky to
land one hit.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.142
Goldie: One is all I need.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.878
How tough could he be with a
name like bluebeard?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.157
I asked for a brunette.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.964
Ha! Ha!

08:21.701 --> 08:23.168
Naughty little girl.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.736
Blondes have more fun.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.905
Ah, we'll see.

08:39.585 --> 08:43.121
Yes, you've met my wives.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.091
No one's ever...

08:46.093 --> 08:47.792
Hit me before.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.629
You must be special.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.901
I'm going to take my time.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.242
Better hurry up then.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.611
I knew I only had one
shot to land a hit.

09:06.746 --> 09:06.745
So I made it count.

09:06.747 --> 09:10.181
Poison should only take a
minute or two.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.786
Give or take.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.095
Alright, bring them in.

09:33.205 --> 09:38.710
Piper: Rumpelstiltskin,
yeah, his mouth definitely
was one of ours.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.146
Where we're from he's a bit
of a bogeyman.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.649
A powerbroker. Literally,
actually.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.017
Traded influence for favors.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.352
Delusions of grandeur,
for sure,

09:47.354 --> 09:50.355
but never quite got
power of his own.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.892
A whisper from him and a king
would hand over his crown.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.360
An army would retreat.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.630
At least that was before he
broke the magic mirror.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.199
It was a gateway between worlds.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.368
He could've used it to go
anywhere.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.203
But he broke it.

10:05.205 --> 10:09.174
Somehow tied himself to it and
he needs it or he is powerless.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.142
Honestly, I don't get it.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.712
If his powers aren't working
then he's just a glorified
conman.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.146
Why do you want him?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.349
It's not what he can do that
I'm interested in,

10:17.351 --> 10:18.883
it's what he knows.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.385
Who he knows.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.788
I'm convinced he wants something
from these messengers.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.125
Or perhaps more likely, that
they want something from him.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.228
Yeah. Yeah, he was pretty
spooked back in the alley.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.098
I got to go with Alice on this
one, Goldie.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.000
If you say so.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.839
Who's next?

10:44.677 --> 10:46.344
The big bad wolf.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.880
Got a temper on him.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.784
Didn't recognize him from back
home, but I know the type.

10:52.918 --> 10:55.153
Found him at the zoo,
of all places.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.758
He was eating the animals.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.360
You didn't see what he did to
those poor little pigs.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.163
Took six tranq darts just to
bring him down.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.966
I thought I was going
to lose my head.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.205
What?
You've seen worse?

11:14.207 --> 11:16.107
I've lived with worse.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.676
Hmm.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.182
Goes by bluebeard,
obvious reasons.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.451
He has a set of blades
he calls his wives.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.788
Somehow it makes him stronger
every time he kill someone.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.024
Goldie: When I picked one up i
could feel the life force of
everyone he killed.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.728
Almost like it was flowing
through me making me stronger.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.129
But he only kills women?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.998
A lot of them.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.234
Is that you in there, Goldie?

11:43.903 --> 11:43.902
Huh?

11:46.238 --> 11:49.074
Oh, he quite fancies you,
doesn't he?

11:50.009 --> 11:51.910
Yes, it is you.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.380
Since those bears didn't
tear you apart,

11:55.382 --> 11:58.950
come sleep in my bed, Goldie.

12:01.353 --> 12:02.887
You okay with him being here?

12:02.889 --> 12:06.124
Goldie.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.159
He doesn't scare me.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.062
When I signed up for this, it
was to get rid of guys like
this,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.330
not start a collection.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.999
Fire with fire and all of that.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.435
If we were to be beat the
messengers,

12:17.437 --> 12:18.870
sooner or later,

12:18.872 --> 12:20.872
we'll need some monsters
of our own.

12:23.776 --> 12:27.512
It's only a matter of time.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.182
Yes.

12:35.354 --> 12:38.389
<i> Alice: It's a start. Get back</i>
<i> out there, you two.</i>

12:38.391 --> 12:41.292
<i>We've reports of missing persons</i>
<i> turning up half eaten.</i>

12:41.294 --> 12:45.063
<i> If I had to guess I'd say</i>
<i> 'witch'</i>

12:45.065 --> 12:50.001
<i> if possible, I'd have you find</i>
<i> her before her next meal.</i>

12:51.804 --> 12:54.372
Piper: It smells like the place.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.307
Goldie: I hate witches.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.250
Careful, Piper.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.018
We're here to catch a witch.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.220
Table for two, huh.

13:09.355 --> 13:12.991
She shouldn't be far from
whatever this is.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.094
Piper: Goldie, he's a messenger.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.897
Piper: What would a witch want
with one of death's messengers?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.033
Goldie: Piper!

13:23.502 --> 13:25.136
Goldie: Hold still!

13:31.010 --> 13:33.411
Witch: He's miiiine!

13:47.059 --> 13:48.993
Oh, I'm sorry am interrupting?

13:52.498 --> 13:54.232
Do I know you?

14:00.606 --> 14:02.507
Looking glass, right?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.342
Am I right?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.610
Death: Hi I'm death, ruler of
the underworld, reaper of souls,

14:05.612 --> 14:07.378
nice to meet you in the flesh.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.947
Well, in this guy's flesh.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.249
Tell Alice I said "hi."

14:19.058 --> 14:20.892
My love.

14:21.360 --> 14:30.435
You're here. You heard me.
And now we can be together.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.037
Hmm.

14:33.572 --> 14:37.542
And who might you be?

14:42.147 --> 14:45.216
Death: You killed one of my
messengers, didn't you?

14:48.387 --> 14:50.355
You did, didn't you?

14:50.923 --> 14:53.091
Death: Naughty girl.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.359
Death: Yeah.

14:59.465 --> 15:05.036
I - I - I dreamt of you,
my love.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.606
Of a new underworld.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.011
Suffer.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.982
Shh.

15:19.184 --> 15:23.922
It takes a certain kind of
crazy to court death.

15:25.291 --> 15:29.494
I only wanted...

15:29.496 --> 15:31.262
To help.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.338
I think you have.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.652
Mission accomplished.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.092
Goldie: Let's bag her up.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.594
Ladies, gentlemen, and men.

16:03.596 --> 16:07.265
May we welcome another
guest to the party.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.667
Apologizes for the neck
restraint.

16:10.703 --> 16:15.039
Make you much less, munchier
than you were before.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.507
Her name is carabosse.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.343
Cannibal witch.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.546
I - I don't even know
where to start.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.148
She's in love with death.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.683
He knew who you were,

16:25.685 --> 16:27.118
and we were.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.753
Goldie: Somehow she was
able to help him

16:28.755 --> 16:31.289
possess a messenger corpse.

16:31.291 --> 16:35.159
Goldie: Alice, death... seemed
almost happy to see us.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.729
Alice: Then let's figure out
if she's part of death's
plan.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.630
Clock's ticking, after all.

16:44.103 --> 16:48.139
Oh, splendid. We're making an
impression.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.258
Carabosse:
Hellooo, rumpelstiltskin.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.761
They found you.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.569
Ah, there you are.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.540
I'd like to show you something.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.514
Months now, we have been chasing
down these messengers

17:29.516 --> 17:34.118
while you've been running around
for what's left of that mirror.

17:34.686 --> 17:37.789
There's nothing magical about
you at all, is there?

17:37.791 --> 17:41.692
Picked this up from one of their
nasty little rituals.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.594
I suspect you know what it is.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.363
What it can do?

17:47.366 --> 17:50.601
I'd like you to tell me so we
have some chance of stopping
them.

17:56.141 --> 17:57.708
I've had my suspicions.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.379
You've run dry.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.783
Why else would you be so
desperate to get your hands

18:05.785 --> 18:09.187
on that little bit
of extra power.

18:10.389 --> 18:13.724
Unless there's something
out there that scares
you more than me?

19:23.362 --> 19:25.396
I like this one.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.598
She's feisty.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.669
Good little pets.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.904
Yes.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.586
Tweedledee: Uh oh.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.455
Tweedledee: I'm coming.

20:06.705 --> 20:11.309
Ah, yes my little pet.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.841
Good night.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.977
Good night, twiddle..Dee?

20:46.712 --> 20:49.647
Contrawise, I'm dum.

20:50.349 --> 20:52.383
Of course you are.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.919
I'll get it next time.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.472
Tweedleddum: She killed him!
Killed my bother!
-Alice: Where is she?

21:14.474 --> 21:16.574
Alice: How did this happen?

21:16.775 --> 21:18.442
It's not like you don't
have a spare.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.544
Alice: Not another word!

21:27.953 --> 21:30.354
Never hurt no one nohow...

21:30.356 --> 21:32.023
I know.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.691
I know.
-Alice: We must find her.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.464
Alice: Before she causes any
more damage...

21:58.617 --> 22:00.084
No, no, no, no.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.386
She must have cut the feed
somehow.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.587
Why wouldn't she just leave?

22:03.589 --> 22:04.955
Why indeed.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.691
There must be something
she wants.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.859
You remember that little
resurrection trick she did.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.595
The morgue?
-Yeah.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.597
I'm gonna go check it out.
-Good, go.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.835
Would you like to sit this
tumble out, love?

22:20.339 --> 22:22.073
Contrawise, mum.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.476
That's a good boy.

22:25.610 --> 22:26.877
Off to the armory
with you, then.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.680
Lock the doors and
watch for witches.

22:29.781 --> 22:32.083
This one is in love with death.

22:32.085 --> 22:34.452
If she's still lurking about
I've no doubt she'd

22:34.454 --> 22:36.554
head there next looking
for his scythe.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.422
Which reminds me,

22:38.424 --> 22:42.059
collect rumpelstiltskin and
meet me upstairs.

23:03.582 --> 23:08.819
Wake up, wake up, my love.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.129
Oh, it's you again.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.834
So this is looking glass.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.040
Wait!

23:31.009 --> 23:32.543
My love.

23:33.011 --> 23:35.045
You need me!

23:36.782 --> 23:37.915
And?

23:41.153 --> 23:43.521
Let me...

23:44.456 --> 23:46.590
Make you whole.

23:48.693 --> 23:52.730
And how do you plan of
doing that, witch?

23:52.732 --> 23:54.165
Here.

23:55.100 --> 23:59.570
Here is everything you
need for the ritual.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.506
I can perform it.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.008
Please?

24:06.812 --> 24:09.580
So this is where they
have my scythe?

24:11.550 --> 24:12.883
Yeah.

24:13.819 --> 24:14.819
I can feel it.

24:14.821 --> 24:18.088
Yes. Yes, it's here.

24:18.957 --> 24:23.894
But, I brought you a
little gift.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.768
Not what you seek...

24:30.936 --> 24:34.839
...but who you seek.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.775
You need to seek a mint.

24:37.777 --> 24:40.744
I hope you're pleased
with yourself.

24:40.746 --> 24:47.184
Tweedledee was a kind and gentle
boy and it's your selfish
meddling which got him killed.

24:47.586 --> 24:50.821
A fact I'm very much aware of.

24:51.756 --> 24:53.090
Now...

24:53.092 --> 24:56.760
I know you know more
than you're letting on.

24:56.762 --> 25:02.533
If I find you've kept anything
from me that would have saved
his life...

25:05.237 --> 25:07.071
I'll have your head.

25:12.077 --> 25:16.881
Everything almost ready.

25:16.883 --> 25:23.687
Just send your messengers and
let me take care of the rest.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.290
Oh they're on their way,
alright.

25:26.625 --> 25:31.128
<i> Death: Find my scythe!</i>
<i> Kill every one of them,</i>
<i> and bring me 'stiltskin!</i>

25:31.130 --> 25:35.666
<i> First messenger that bags me</i>
<i> a monster gets to skip a</i>
<i> circle of hell.</i>

25:43.543 --> 25:45.576
<i> Goldie here. We're breached.</i>
<i> Lock it down.</i>

25:45.578 --> 25:47.077
<i> I'm securing the prisoners.</i>

25:47.079 --> 25:50.281
<i> Stay sharp. We don't know how</i>
<i> many there are.</i>

26:21.947 --> 26:23.981
Bluebeard.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.250
Oh no.
-You didn't think I'd leave
without saying goodbye, did you?

26:33.658 --> 26:35.759
You remember my wives,
don't you?

26:36.661 --> 26:38.162
They remember you.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.734
Let's have a threesome.

27:03.321 --> 27:05.189
Bad doggie.

27:17.770 --> 27:21.138
Alice: Apologies for leaving but
we're in a spot of bother at
present.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.341
Death has come and found us
wanting, I'm afraid.

27:24.343 --> 27:28.412
As you can see, we're under
attack and I'm a tad
shorthanded.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.948
You're either with us or not.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.350
I'm hoping these insure
the former.

27:36.821 --> 27:41.158
Picked them up in wonderland,
all though I fear I don't recall
how.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.060
Quite explosive.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.995
My little insurance policy.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.831
It's time for you to prove your
usefulness.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.235
Sorry I can't wait around for
you to come to your senses on
your own time.

27:51.237 --> 27:57.041
You see, sense is rather useless
sentiment with so much
senselessness afoot.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.409
You work for me now.

27:58.411 --> 28:00.711
If you try to leave,
I'll kill you.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.813
If you try to remove it,
I'll kill you.

28:02.815 --> 28:07.685
As a matter a fact, if you
do anything I don't like,
I'll kill you.

28:07.819 --> 28:10.220
Blink twice if we have a deal.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.922
Splendid.

28:13.191 --> 28:16.326
Now, you have a visitor.

28:16.795 --> 28:19.863
Alice: I believe you've met
"her majesty," queen of hearts?

28:20.198 --> 28:23.467
Your first task is to get
her to wear this.

28:27.405 --> 28:30.140
Welcome to looking glass.

28:32.944 --> 28:34.812
Hel-lo?

28:36.815 --> 28:38.816
Gelda, baby!

28:39.284 --> 28:41.485
Rumpy!

28:42.220 --> 28:44.188
What are you doing here?

28:48.761 --> 28:51.095
<i> Rumpy: How long has it been?</i>
<i> -Gelda: Oh, don't pretend like</i>
<i> you don't know!</i>

28:51.097 --> 28:54.965
What's going on out there?
-It's the messengers, the
place is crawling with them.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.468
It's going to be like herding
mice getting rid of...

28:57.470 --> 28:58.502
Who is she?

28:58.504 --> 29:00.471
She's one of mine.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.773
So she's nuts?

29:02.775 --> 29:05.743
Apparently the two of them used
to be an item if that tells you
anything.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.912
Rumpy, you look terrible.

29:11.117 --> 29:14.017
Why am I not surprised to find
you between yet another rock and
a hard place?

29:14.019 --> 29:17.121
How did you know I was here?

29:17.123 --> 29:21.992
Oh, I always like to know right
where you are.

29:22.293 --> 29:25.095
I couldn't let anything happen
to my little rumpy.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.297
What have you gotten
yourself into?

29:27.299 --> 29:31.769
Well, it's been a little rough
since the last time I saw you.

29:31.771 --> 29:35.439
Apparently, if you've thrown in
with this lot.

29:38.309 --> 29:42.045
Gelda: You know, that Alice is
quite batty, don't you?

29:42.047 --> 29:44.314
So maybe we can take this
reunion to the cell block?

29:44.316 --> 29:46.517
Considering we're a little
exposed here?

29:46.519 --> 29:48.919
We're reasonably safe if
she's near.

29:48.921 --> 29:53.957
She's unhinged, unpredictable,
and unfortunately something of a
secret weapon.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.293
Alice: If she's going to help,
we'll need him to convince her.

29:58.363 --> 30:00.063
She can control them.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.034
Any man, really.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.305
Any man but him.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.911
Oh, trust me...

30:13.913 --> 30:16.246
She's nuts!

30:16.881 --> 30:18.916
Completely insane.

30:19.551 --> 30:24.288
And she's got me by the balls,
gelda.

30:25.056 --> 30:26.824
Oh, does she?

30:26.958 --> 30:29.927
Oh, yes. Right under her thumb.

30:29.929 --> 30:33.997
Well, we can't have that.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.519
You could have escaped
whenever you wanted to.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.257
Why didn't you?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.227
Leave.

31:12.270 --> 31:17.341
When we found you, you were
eating zoo animals for food.

31:20.478 --> 31:23.213
Is that because you didn't
want to hurt people?

31:25.283 --> 31:29.353
All I do is hurt people.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.559
Right now that's a talent
we can use.

31:37.662 --> 31:40.931
Tell me, what is it that she
wants from you?

31:41.099 --> 31:45.903
Oh she thinks I have something
to do with death and his
messengers.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.639
And do you?
-Of course not!

31:48.973 --> 31:54.678
But she won't help me unless
i help her stop them.

31:55.079 --> 31:59.416
If I'm going to get out of this,
i need your help.

31:59.418 --> 32:03.620
Of course you do! And I can
leave anytime I want, darling.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.390
But I can't.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.161
I need your help.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.063
Please, baby.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.069
What do you need me to do?

32:21.472 --> 32:23.273
I need you to put this on.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.975
That's mine!

32:24.977 --> 32:27.277
Oh no! Goodbye, rumpy!
You're on your own!

32:27.279 --> 32:28.512
Call me if you make it
out of this.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.080
Do I have to beg?

32:30.082 --> 32:32.049
Then beg!

32:34.252 --> 32:35.953
Gelda,

32:35.955 --> 32:37.354
my queen,

32:37.356 --> 32:38.455
my love...

32:38.457 --> 32:39.556
Do you love me?

32:39.558 --> 32:40.657
What's not to love?

32:40.659 --> 32:43.293
Yes! Yes, I love you!

32:43.295 --> 32:45.996
But you left me.

32:46.130 --> 32:49.199
Well, you did marry a king.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.601
King of the morons and
the crazies.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.304
I hate crazy! I hate it!

32:54.672 --> 32:58.642
Rumpy, I was so boring
without you.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.577
You were supposed to come visit.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.612
And I waited and I waited for
you to get your hands on

33:02.614 --> 33:05.282
that mirror and you broke it.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.452
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:08.553 --> 33:11.355
That was an accident,
really, baby.

33:13.591 --> 33:15.659
I never really wanted
to be here...

33:16.294 --> 33:18.595
With her.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.766
I'd rather much be here
with you.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.634
I'm waiting.

33:27.206 --> 33:35.145
Gelda, queen of hearts,
queen of my heart.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.714
Please, show me kindness.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.549
Stay, baby.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.786
You know I could never
be apart from you.

33:43.187 --> 33:48.291
You're lucky I've always had
a soft spot for you.

33:48.293 --> 33:55.032
Sometimes I wonder how much of
that was real and how much of
that was mind control.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.200
Oh, gelda.

33:57.368 --> 34:02.806
You and I both know... I could
never control you.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.077
Nor I you.

34:07.412 --> 34:08.678
Awe.

34:10.281 --> 34:11.715
So you agree to help?

34:13.652 --> 34:15.518
I do.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.790
Splendid! It's official.

34:20.491 --> 34:23.092
You sure you want to strap
bombs to these nut jobs?

34:23.094 --> 34:25.495
Alice: Let's not think too much
about it, shall we?

34:25.496 --> 34:28.398
What now then?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.667
Alice: Now we let the
monsters out.

34:30.668 --> 34:33.469
Rumpy:...Sitting pretty.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.639
- Piper: Oh yeah.
- -Gelda:

34:40.812 --> 34:44.214
Alice: Alright beasties, time to
earn your keep.

34:44.216 --> 34:50.087
We've some unwanted guests and
I'd like the lot of you to help
me shoo them away.

34:50.288 --> 34:51.855
Oh no, what now?

34:51.857 --> 34:54.757
Alice: Gelda, darling,
meet bluebeard.

34:54.760 --> 34:59.529
Alice: He's a nasty one.
He'll need a little of your
"convincing."

34:59.531 --> 35:04.835
I'd like him in goldilock's
care. She's no stranger to
brutes.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.106
Why would I help you?

35:09.340 --> 35:11.308
Is this our naughty boy?

35:11.442 --> 35:13.477
Alice: I don't like it any more
than you do.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.812
But I'm without
options at present.

35:19.317 --> 35:22.486
Well, I would love to
slaughter all of you.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.322
It'd be fun.

35:25.324 --> 35:28.291
You'll help because I tell you
too, silly.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.527
You'll be a good boy and
do everything

35:30.529 --> 35:34.364
miss goldilocks
here tells you to.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.700
Goldie: Don't worry.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.436
Won't you?

35:40.171 --> 35:41.771
Yes.

35:45.276 --> 35:47.544
Are you a good boy, now?

35:48.746 --> 35:50.814
Are you a good boy?

35:50.816 --> 35:53.416
A good boy.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.152
Perfect.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.721
Piper: Alice, if she can mind
control him like that,

35:58.422 --> 36:01.558
any reason why we can't just put
her on the pa and tell these
guys to back off?

36:01.560 --> 36:06.229
Unfortunately, her <i> charms</i> only
work in person.

36:06.864 --> 36:08.598
How do you do it anyway?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.501
Some of us are natural
leaders, darling.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.870
Alice: Goldilocks, dear. What
about our Wolfie?

36:19.877 --> 36:21.878
Can I trust you?

36:26.717 --> 36:27.951
No.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.458
Then trust me.

36:46.504 --> 36:47.771
Goldie: He'll be fine.

36:49.607 --> 36:50.473
Alice: That settles that, then.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.877
Rumpelstiltskin?

36:53.879 --> 36:56.346
Tell us what you know.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.815
Thought you'd never ask.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.223
Well...

37:08.292 --> 37:11.995
He calls himself <i> death</i> .

37:12.330 --> 37:14.397
Total hack.

37:14.599 --> 37:17.367
He runs a shit show called
<i> "the underworld."</i>

37:17.369 --> 37:20.303
You see he's just a hustler.

37:20.305 --> 37:23.240
He does something for you, you
do something for him,

37:23.242 --> 37:27.711
he gets your soul for the
underworld.

37:27.812 --> 37:31.881
Now, a while back he asked me to
get a hold of something for him.

37:31.883 --> 37:36.453
The old magic mirror.

37:36.455 --> 37:44.694
He wanted to use it to come here
and take over, so I broke it.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.597
And now he's just stuck there
and can't get anything done

37:47.599 --> 37:51.968
anywhere else without acting
through his cult.

37:52.503 --> 37:55.338
Death's messengers.

37:56.440 --> 38:00.877
Oooohhh, scary!

38:01.612 --> 38:06.283
But, they're just people that
can be killed.

38:06.285 --> 38:09.452
Luckily, you're all
excellent killers.

38:09.654 --> 38:13.890
If he's here, it's because he
knows you have the scythe.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.393
If they get it to that witch,
she'll be able to perform a

38:16.395 --> 38:19.696
ritual to summon death here
to this realm.

38:19.698 --> 38:25.902
And that my friends would be
a real problem.

38:25.904 --> 38:32.375
Death and decay, spreading
like a cancer, hmm?

38:32.543 --> 38:38.315
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.617
And that's why we're going
to stop him.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.985
Excuse me?

38:41.987 --> 38:44.654
And why you're all
going to help.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.592
<i> Attention death's messengers,</i>

38:49.594 --> 38:51.961
<i> we're not afraid of you.</i>

38:51.963 --> 38:56.099
<i> We know what you're after and</i>
<i>you'll never get your bony hands</i>
<i> on it I'm afraid.</i>

38:56.101 --> 38:58.968
<i>Alice: You're about to find out</i>
<i> what we've been keeping in our</i>
<i> basement.</i>

38:58.970 --> 39:01.771
<i> This is your last warning.</i>

39:01.872 --> 39:03.473
Yo, mice!

39:05.643 --> 39:09.646
<i> Leave my facility or you won't</i>
<i> like what happens next.</i>

39:09.648 --> 39:11.414
<i> That is all.</i>

39:22.394 --> 39:24.627
Thank you.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.535
Finally. What's your plan to
get this thing off?

40:05.537 --> 40:08.104
What do you mean?
-What do you mean what
do I mean?

40:08.106 --> 40:10.940
Oh I can't imagine that you're
here and you don't have a plan.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.977
You do have a plan, right?

40:13.979 --> 40:15.478
Yes.

40:15.946 --> 40:17.914
Well, I'm working on it.

40:19.817 --> 40:21.484
Ever wonder if keeping a
basement full of monsters
was a bad idea?

40:21.486 --> 40:22.752
Constantly.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.488
You good here?

40:25.490 --> 40:27.524
I'm off to my witch hunt.
-I got these two.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.559
- Goldie: Bluebeard is
having his fun.

40:29.561 --> 40:33.630
Goldie: And the wolf is, well
he's working out some anger
issues.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.832
At least it's not <i> mice</i> .

40:36.133 --> 40:38.134
Oh, rumpy, I am very
disappointed.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.503
No, no, no, no, no listen.

40:40.505 --> 40:44.007
Just bide our time and find
ourselves in the armory.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.175
What for?

40:45.177 --> 40:46.876
The magic mirror.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.712
She's got some locked up with
that big fat idiot.

40:49.714 --> 40:54.651
Enough for one last shot of
the ol' magic.

40:54.653 --> 40:57.454
At least enough to
make her let me go.

40:57.456 --> 41:00.623
Oh, but then, clearly you
don't need me then.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.993
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
gelda, baby. Come on!

41:03.995 --> 41:05.962
It's your little rump
roast, please.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.514
Wake up.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.652
This?

41:29.654 --> 41:31.020
This is your plan?

41:31.022 --> 41:33.857
I'm running out of messengers
here, witch.

41:34.258 --> 41:36.226
See how desperate she is?

41:36.228 --> 41:43.566
Desperate enough to let
rumpelstiltskin out of his
hidey-hole.

41:43.568 --> 41:47.170
So they're working together?
That's adorable.

41:47.705 --> 41:50.039
Listen, seriously.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.908
We just have to see this
through, right?

41:51.910 --> 41:57.647
Play her game and make her
think she's in charge.

41:57.948 --> 42:01.017
If you believe that, you're
even madder than she is.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.621
Gelda, wait!

42:04.755 --> 42:05.788
Drop it.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.561
What?

42:20.304 --> 42:22.272
Oh, rumpy.

42:22.606 --> 42:23.873
You do care!

42:23.875 --> 42:26.109
You like that, don't you baby?

42:31.215 --> 42:33.082
I want to talk to 'stiltskin.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.717
Want to make that happen?

42:34.719 --> 42:36.085
Oh, yes.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.921
Carabosse: Yes.

42:37.923 --> 42:40.590
Maybe you're not as useless
as I thought, huh?

42:43.994 --> 42:45.995
Piper: 'Sup, witch?

42:51.235 --> 42:53.603
Owe you one, Piper.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.243
Goldie: Bluebeard.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.778
Down boy.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.947
Keep your paws off her.

43:03.949 --> 43:06.816
She belongs to me.
-Shut up.

43:07.017 --> 43:09.085
Goldie: No! Don't hurt him!

43:11.288 --> 43:12.689
Hey!

43:13.190 --> 43:14.190
Hey.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.960
Trust me, remember?

43:18.128 --> 43:19.262
It's okay.

43:20.197 --> 43:21.664
It's okay.

43:23.133 --> 43:25.168
There's still more
of you, okay?

43:25.936 --> 43:27.303
We...

43:28.372 --> 43:30.106
I need you.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.041
Goldie: Snap out of it.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.010
Goldie: Better yet, use it.

43:34.012 --> 43:35.745
Goldie: This isn't over.

43:37.982 --> 43:42.051
I'm sorry.

43:42.053 --> 43:44.153
I warned you.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.957
Be careful.

43:48.759 --> 43:50.760
I'll tear this whole
place down.

43:58.068 --> 44:00.003
- There's still a bunch of them
upstairs.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.373
How did we do?
-Shut it!

44:03.707 --> 44:05.041
Yes, mum.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.043
Did you have an accident?

44:07.045 --> 44:09.145
How about a pooper scooper?

44:14.819 --> 44:16.185
Mustn't dally now.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.187
Taking too long.
Mustn't waste time.

44:18.789 --> 44:20.823
Alice: You're late, you're late,
you're late.

44:20.825 --> 44:23.393
You've gone and mucked
things up, Alice.

44:23.395 --> 44:27.897
Trading monsters for messengers,
and more are coming to join the
fun.

44:27.899 --> 44:30.233
You've figured out the players,
but not the game.

44:31.135 --> 44:34.404
You know who loves games,
don't you, Alice?

44:35.973 --> 44:37.907
Oh, god.

44:42.781 --> 44:48.718
Alice: Goldilocks, if
you could be so kind, it's just
occurred to me that we're
missing a guest.

45:03.467 --> 45:05.768
Bring me hatter.

45:58.322 --> 46:00.123
Hatter.

46:08.866 --> 46:10.433
Cuppa?

46:15.205 --> 46:17.774
Aren't there usually
four of you?

46:18.175 --> 46:23.079
All in all not bad. But I'd be
surprised if that was the last
of the messengers.

46:23.081 --> 46:24.781
I imagine it wasn't.

46:24.915 --> 46:24.914
You're back to witch duty.

46:29.887 --> 46:32.889
Apologies, love, seems it's
going to be a long night.

46:32.891 --> 46:33.856
Off you pop.

46:33.858 --> 46:36.125
Yes, mum.

46:38.228 --> 46:40.830
Hatter.
-Gelda: Alice?

46:40.832 --> 46:44.400
Well we all had a good, bloody
time on your behalf and you
should be pleased.

46:44.402 --> 46:47.170
So, what do you say we take
these off, yes?

46:47.172 --> 46:48.437
Absolutely not.

46:48.439 --> 46:50.239
Rumpy!

46:50.241 --> 46:52.875
You said if I played along
that she'd take these away.

46:52.877 --> 46:59.081
Gelda, baby it's just so Alice
here feels safe.

46:59.216 --> 47:02.084
Do you feel safe?

47:02.853 --> 47:06.289
I doubt very much she'd
blow me up with all of us
standing here!

47:06.291 --> 47:08.257
Don't be so certain.

47:08.259 --> 47:10.560
I'm getting bored of this game!

47:10.562 --> 47:13.529
Pretty soon I won't want
to play anymore.

47:13.531 --> 47:16.065
You're killing me, here.

47:17.868 --> 47:21.037
Imagine going home to
that every night.

47:24.474 --> 47:26.142
Hatter...

47:26.144 --> 47:29.111
I need you to take a little
trip for me, love.

47:29.113 --> 47:31.247
Oh, what fun.

47:31.348 --> 47:33.449
Where are we going?

47:34.117 --> 47:38.955
Well, the underworld,
I'm afraid.

47:44.628 --> 47:48.531
Oh well then, that'll take a nip
of the good stuff.

47:48.932 --> 47:50.900
I thought you might say that.

47:50.902 --> 47:53.469
Alice: No better 'trip' outside
of wonderland.

47:55.939 --> 47:57.607
Are you really doing this,
Alice?

47:57.609 --> 48:00.343
Oh, don't worry about
hatter, dear.

48:00.345 --> 48:03.913
This'll be mild compared to what
he got up to in wonderland.

48:05.649 --> 48:08.184
Goldie: If you say so.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.889
What's wrong?
- Are you serious?

48:12.891 --> 48:14.090
I can't believe she's
doing this.

48:14.092 --> 48:16.525
Desperate times, Goldie.

48:16.894 --> 48:22.031
Alice took us in and for a while
everything felt just right.

48:22.033 --> 48:25.368
Lately I'm wondering if we made
a mistake in trusting her.

48:25.370 --> 48:27.637
Classic goldilocks.

48:27.639 --> 48:29.138
I'm serious, Piper.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.073
I know!
-Well then, act like it.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.642
I am.

48:33.143 --> 48:34.343
Look.

48:36.513 --> 48:40.549
I'm going to go back to my witch
hunt and I'm going to go check
on tweedle...Dum?

48:41.985 --> 48:46.055
His brother is dead, Piper. It's
not funny anymore.

48:46.057 --> 48:47.990
We'll get through this, Goldie.

48:47.992 --> 48:49.592
Okay?

48:55.198 --> 48:58.134
Remember hatter,
the underworld.

48:58.268 --> 49:00.202
I need to know what death
is planning.

49:00.204 --> 49:01.637
Hatter: Yes, yes, yes.
- Do you think you can do that
for me?

49:01.639 --> 49:05.308
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

49:05.310 --> 49:10.680
I always fancy a tumble down the
ol' rabbit hole, dear.

49:10.682 --> 49:12.648
Alright then, sit back.

49:20.123 --> 49:23.059
Hatter: Oh yes...

49:23.061 --> 49:25.962
Bad vibes here, dear Alice.

49:26.964 --> 49:28.531
Taste like...

49:28.665 --> 49:30.433
Mutiny.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.101
Murder.

49:32.103 --> 49:34.403
Malice.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.139
Have I made a rhyme?

49:43.447 --> 49:46.115
Hatter: I feel like to pop.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.060
Hatter: Good stuff.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.702
He'll be like this for
some time.

50:09.439 --> 50:10.706
Psst.

50:10.708 --> 50:12.475
Hey buddy.

50:12.477 --> 50:14.276
Seen any witches?

50:14.745 --> 50:17.046
Contrawise.

50:17.048 --> 50:21.684
If the witch was here, you won't
need ask, nohow.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.555
Listen, I'm sorry about
your brother.

50:27.457 --> 50:31.627
I know I wasn't the nicest to
him, but you know--

50:39.336 --> 50:42.104
it's okay.

50:43.273 --> 50:45.508
Keep your head up high,
big guy.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.811
Alright. Okay.

50:48.813 --> 50:51.380
Alright, buddy.

51:01.825 --> 51:04.393
How long is this gonna take?

51:08.165 --> 51:13.069
There's nasty business afoot
this evening, Alice, my dear.

51:13.071 --> 51:15.538
Yes, hatter.
We know.

51:15.540 --> 51:17.573
What nasty business?

51:17.575 --> 51:19.308
What are they looking for?

51:19.310 --> 51:21.444
Best be quick like now.

51:21.446 --> 51:24.246
They nearly have
everything they need.

51:24.581 --> 51:26.282
What do they need, hatter?

51:26.284 --> 51:27.550
The prickly thing.

51:27.552 --> 51:29.185
The scythe.

51:29.719 --> 51:31.487
And the proper attire,
of course.

51:31.489 --> 51:36.292
Attire? For what?
Hatter, what attire?

51:36.294 --> 51:39.361
For the grand party, of course.

51:40.197 --> 51:42.498
But you won't like the
guest list.

51:44.301 --> 51:46.135
Death is coming.

51:53.710 --> 51:56.245
And he has grand plans for you.

51:57.581 --> 52:00.249
Grand, grand, big funny plans.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.553
What does he mean?

52:07.324 --> 52:09.458
What does death want with you?

52:10.794 --> 52:14.130
I want to stop him as
much as you do.

52:17.435 --> 52:19.468
Where's gelda?

52:23.607 --> 52:27.243
Alice: Goldilocks, be a dear
and head outside to check the
roof.

52:27.245 --> 52:30.412
Gelda, darling, don't make me
blow you up, sweetheart.

52:30.414 --> 52:31.614
Gelda, come back.

52:31.616 --> 52:33.616
Rumpy: Gelda, come back.

52:33.618 --> 52:35.618
[Over pa}
Alice: Gelda, I'm not joking.
Not one more step.

52:35.620 --> 52:37.920
No, no, no. Let me talk to her.

52:37.922 --> 52:40.756
I can give her the rumpy noodle.
Come on.

52:41.324 --> 52:42.758
Alright, buddy.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.160
Okay.

52:44.162 --> 52:45.928
Alright, big guy.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.530
That's good.

52:57.574 --> 52:59.575
Tweedledum: You're okay.

52:59.577 --> 53:00.943
Tweedledum!

53:08.919 --> 53:11.320
That's far enough!

53:15.292 --> 53:17.226
Hmm.

53:18.662 --> 53:20.729
Like me, now.

53:25.302 --> 53:27.903
And off with your head!

53:30.640 --> 53:33.275
Uh-uh.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.648
Oh, which one is that?

53:41.351 --> 53:43.485
That's tweedledum.

53:44.521 --> 53:45.921
Hmm.

53:47.457 --> 53:48.991
Drop it.

53:51.494 --> 53:53.629
Drop it.

53:56.266 --> 53:58.234
Open it.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.514
Take a hike, pipsqueak.

54:19.457 --> 54:21.690
Gelda, I will blow you up!

54:22.359 --> 54:24.460
Well, go ahead then.

54:25.962 --> 54:27.930
She's in the armory.

54:27.932 --> 54:30.266
That's it.

54:30.268 --> 54:33.535
If we're lucky she'll take that
scythe with her.
-No, no, no, no, no, please.

54:33.537 --> 54:35.838
Let me talk to her.
Let me go and get her.

54:35.840 --> 54:38.607
You two are pals,
right?

54:38.842 --> 54:40.976
You remember the magic mirror?

54:41.311 --> 54:43.612
The last time I broke something
like that, it got us into

54:43.614 --> 54:45.781
this whole mess in
the first place.

54:45.783 --> 54:47.416
But the scythe is even more
powerful.

54:47.418 --> 54:49.551
No one knows what will
happen if it goes off.

54:51.488 --> 54:54.823
Please.
Alice, come on.

54:58.728 --> 54:59.962
Fine.

55:01.398 --> 55:02.665
Ten minutes or I will
kill you both.

55:02.667 --> 55:05.668
Good, I can make it work.

55:06.736 --> 55:08.370
Why do you care?

55:09.739 --> 55:11.640
Because I love her.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.876
Of course.

55:23.553 --> 55:27.323
Tonight is the night, my love.

55:27.590 --> 55:30.392
Only if you keep your promise,
witch.

55:32.696 --> 55:35.431
I will. I will.

55:37.934 --> 55:41.403
Oh yeah? Then do it.

55:53.683 --> 55:55.984
Piper : Gotcha.

56:01.726 --> 56:03.525
Look what I found.

56:09.632 --> 56:13.102
Alice: Just the witch i
wanted to see.

56:13.436 --> 56:15.904
Alice, tweedledum...He...

56:23.480 --> 56:26.482
Two down.

56:34.624 --> 56:35.891
Hatter.

56:37.727 --> 56:40.462
I could use a riddle about now.

56:41.064 --> 56:46.602
Alice, you don't seem much of
the riddling sport.

56:49.707 --> 56:51.840
Hatter, something's happened.

56:53.710 --> 56:55.978
We've lost another friend.

56:56.713 --> 56:59.548
Perhaps we ought to
lose one more.

57:02.752 --> 57:04.453
Alice...

57:09.125 --> 57:11.527
Bring me one of the bodies.

57:11.529 --> 57:12.628
The messengers?

57:12.630 --> 57:14.997
Yes. Go.

57:16.633 --> 57:18.200
Okay.

57:25.208 --> 57:26.842
Wake him up.

57:27.177 --> 57:28.944
I want to talk to him.

57:29.579 --> 57:33.081
What makes you think he
wants to talk to you?

57:33.817 --> 57:35.751
Because I want to
offer him a deal.

57:41.724 --> 57:43.859
So...

57:43.861 --> 57:49.465
Is this the part where one of
us says "so we finally meet
at last?"

57:53.503 --> 57:55.637
We finally meet at last.

57:56.706 --> 57:58.173
What do you got for me?

57:58.175 --> 58:00.008
A consolation prize really.

58:00.010 --> 58:03.812
You see, we'll never let you
have your little ceremony.

58:04.814 --> 58:06.715
Forget your interest in this
realm...

58:08.685 --> 58:10.919
And I'll give you
rumpelstiltskin.

58:12.088 --> 58:15.123
Hmm, stiltskin.

58:23.833 --> 58:25.200
Did I getcha?

58:27.604 --> 58:31.073
Anyway, I just had the most
interesting conversation with
the rabbit chaser.

58:31.574 --> 58:32.941
You got to hear about it.

58:39.716 --> 58:41.149
You...

58:42.819 --> 58:44.086
You.

58:44.721 --> 58:45.821
Ha.

58:46.990 --> 58:48.924
You caused me some
trouble, bud.

58:49.692 --> 58:51.627
Look, buddy.

58:51.895 --> 58:54.663
Can you scroll me to
the bottom here?

58:54.665 --> 58:58.734
Kind of on the clock
here courtesy of Alice.

59:00.236 --> 59:01.837
You know she tried
to trade you?

59:03.540 --> 59:04.973
She?

59:04.975 --> 59:07.109
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She
offered you right up.

59:08.011 --> 59:15.117
To be fair, ii should say, you
know, her world for your
worthless life.

59:15.318 --> 59:17.052
But there's no question there.

59:20.890 --> 59:22.991
There's no trust
between you two.

59:23.993 --> 59:27.829
Ironically, she still has no
idea that you are way more

59:27.831 --> 59:30.699
valuable to me than
you are to her.

59:30.967 --> 59:32.334
So what do you want, huh?

59:32.336 --> 59:34.136
Spit it out.

59:36.139 --> 59:39.074
What do I want, what do I want,
what do I want. What I've always
wanted...

59:39.076 --> 59:41.310
Before you broke the mirror.

59:41.312 --> 59:46.014
Hey, ta, ta, ta, ta,
ta, ta...Accident.

59:47.016 --> 59:50.185
Hey, there are set backs.

59:51.254 --> 59:52.721
It's cool, baby.

59:52.723 --> 59:56.825
I'm flexible. I got a
backup plan.

59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.162
You.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.068
How is that?

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:12.240
These bodies...They're...

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.842
So fragile.

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:19.781
They deteriorate so
quickly but, not you.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:24.152
No, see, you've had real power.
You just pissed it all away

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:27.990
and now you're just
scrambling to get it back.

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:32.227
See in your body, in your
body I'd be permanent.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:34.129
Whole.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.831
Look, buddy...

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:40.902
I'm not seeing the silver
lining here, pal.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:43.138
You give me your body.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:48.010
I'd rather let Alice blow me up.

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:52.114
And you get the underworld.

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:55.651
Now we're talking.

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.689
Al.

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:03.692
We have the witch. The scythe.

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:05.193
And Goldie will be back soon.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:07.029
There could be only so many
messengers out there.

01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:11.400
Then tell me this: If we've
won, why is she so tickled?

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.306
Look.

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:22.878
You've always wanted to be
more than just a lapdog.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:25.013
Yeah.
-Real power.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:28.383
A kingdom of your own.
-Yeah.

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:31.086
So be my lapdog.

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:37.959
Trade me your body. I'll rule
this realm and you can have my
scraps.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.928
I'm sick of the underworld,
man.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:44.099
It's time for me to move on.
It's a good fit for you though.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:46.968
Considering, well, obviously.

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:50.172
What if I say...

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.407
No.

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:58.246
Well, Alice will lock you up
and I know just where to find
you.

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:02.217
And I will keep coming and
coming and coming.

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:07.456
The underworld has no
shortage of souls, brother.
Trust me on that.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:09.958
Nobody wants to die.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.195
Eventually, she's going to find
out and she's just going to kill
you.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:15.997
Then I'll just have to find
another way. Just come on.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.966
Save me the headache.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.303
Alice will kill me anyway
if I say yes.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:26.374
Lot'a good my body'll do you if
she blows it up.

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:31.780
So then we got to make it look
real good then, don't we?

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.920
Something funny is going on
and I don't like it.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.790
I don't like it one bit.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.861
How puzzling.

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:49.765
All these changes.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:53.935
I don't know who I am from one
minute to the next.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:03:00.008
Running as fast as I can just to
stay in one place.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:05.313
I'm afraid if I don't find out
soon, I'll do something quite
rash.

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.149
Alice?

01:03:07.151 --> 01:03:10.385
Piper, be a dear and head
upstairs for me?

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:11.486
Where am I going?

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:13.188
The armory, of course.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:17.025
I'll not gain a pawn only to
sacrifice my queen.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.361
Okay.

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:36.278
Rumpy, dear, I'm feeling quite
tested.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.017
I hope you're not plotting.
I mean it now. Your ten
minutes is almost up.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:45.120
If you don't bring gelda right
back down here then

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:49.157
I'm afraid you'll leave me no
choice but to blow you both!

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.560
Best not be late.

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.296
Rumpy: Where is it?
-Gelda: What took you so long?

01:03:54.298 --> 01:03:56.064
Rumpy: Where is it?
-Gelda: Where were you?

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:58.466
Excuse me?

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.436
No 'thank you?'

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.506
thank you for what?

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.009
Is this what you're looking for?

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:11.079
Did I do good?

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:12.848
I did, didn't I?

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.983
You did great, baby.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:17.219
I want it like old times,
rumpy.

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:22.023
When it was just you and me and
everybody did what we said.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.892
And no Alice.

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:27.028
I want it like that too, baby.

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:31.600
But someone has to stop death.

01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:33.435
Let her deal with it.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:37.305
Rumpy, let's run away
together!

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:41.042
Gelda, I can't run anymore.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:43.211
You don't understand.
-No.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.480
I don't think you understand.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:47.315
He'll never stop.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.118
Don't you know?

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.356
Death always catches up to you.

01:04:54.358 --> 01:05:00.428
Now, I have a plan for both of
us to get out of this,
together.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:06.067
You just need to give me that
vial and trust me.

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:10.505
Gelda.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.973
Please.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.310
This is the one thing that can
get me out of this.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:19.514
Wrong. I'm the one that can get
you out of this. Me!

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:23.218
And, it's time you start
acting like it.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.920
Gelda, stop!

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:26.621
You're right.

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:29.524
You're absolutely right, baby.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:31.559
I love you.

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:35.964
Now let's just take that, and
go to Alice and just give me--

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.933
where were you?

01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:41.469
What? What do you mean?

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:45.440
You better tell me now?

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.943
Okay, okay, okay. It was him.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.544
It was death, alright?

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.646
He offered me a deal I didn't
like, so I didn't take it.

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:52.514
What deal?

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:54.182
Gelda, please.

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:57.485
A trick. A trick, alright?

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:02.991
I give him my body, and he lets
me take the underworld.

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.225
Eww.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.361
Exactly, now come on.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:12.400
So you turned him down then?

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:14.569
For me?

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.072
Yes, of course.

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:22.978
So that we can be
together, forever.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:28.383
Yes.
--Promise me.

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:31.753
Gelda...

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:34.255
I promise.

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.325
If this works out -- --

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.361
if?

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.299
I promise.

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:46.401
We'll be together.

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.204
Forever.

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:10.125
I love you.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.431
Rumpy: I'm sorry, gelda.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:21.236
It had to look believable.

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:25.306
It was the only way.

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:50.565
Goldie: It's a robe. That
must be the 'attire' hatter saw.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.135
Let's get out of there
and do this quietly.

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.405
Come on, bluebeard.

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:14.422
Are you a good boy? A good boy?
Good boy.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:20.562
Goldilocks dear, please do
return soon as you can.

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.609
Sick 'em.

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:42.383
Where's bluebeard?

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:47.188
As much as I would love to tear
her apart...

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:51.493
Why don't you show me that wild
side you been trying so hard to
keep at bay.

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:00.135
Are you okay?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.669
Where's the robe?

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.743
Goldie: Come on. Where's
the robe?

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.245
Run!

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.514
Hey is just me remember?

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:16.350
We have to get back
inside and help!

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.621
Run!

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:26.294
I'm afraid that's as far as i
can trust you, rumpelstiltskin.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:31.399
Piper: He's here! He's here!
Please don't blow him up.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:36.604
Aren't you supposed to be the
master plotter here? What's
happening? What's their game?

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:39.407
Alice, we really need to talk.
-No.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:43.611
You need to tell me what's going
on or else I don't think I have
a need for you anymore.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:46.648
As a matter of fact, I think i
like you better back in your
cell.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.951
Listen, if you want to stop for
good then I have to tell you
something,

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.453
and you're really going to have
to trust me.

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:55.890
You must think me mad.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.926
All you've done is lie.

01:09:57.928 --> 01:09:57.926
Why should I trust you?

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:07.802
Honestly, if this was your
plan, no wonder death dumped
your ass.

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.737
Good evening, Piper,

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.873
I'll take that.

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.514
Aah!

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.883
Piper!

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:44.572
Wait!

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:48.309
That one, we need alive.

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:51.012
You're not any fun.

01:10:56.552 --> 01:11:01.289
Bluebeard: I believe this is
what you need. I want in.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.591
Rumpelstiltskin?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.026
Rumpelstiltskin?

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:44.999
Chin up Piper, we'll figure
something out.

01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:52.707
So this is where you've
been hiding?

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:07.555
You gotta admit, it's pretty
funny how things work out
sometimes, huh?

01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:18.666
You. I'm so sorry. You must be
feeling so out of the loop right
now.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:24.339
<i> Well let me catch you up to</i>
<i> speed.</i>

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:29.911
See after our conversation, i
had another little chat...

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:32.046
With this guy.

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:35.583
What does he mean?

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:39.987
Oh!

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.557
What do I mean, what do I mean,
what do I mean,

01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:49.097
what do I mean is it's time for
you to come through on your end
of the deal.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.501
Death: Man.

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:58.740
You will do anything to wiggle
yourself out of trouble.

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.377
Am I right?

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:09.083
Even killing the only woman who
ever really loved you.

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:10.551
You're real scum.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:11.919
I gotta respect that.

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:15.923
Booboo?

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.427
Come here, girl!
Come here, girl!

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:22.463
Come, girl!
Come, girl... stay!

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.699
See, I forgot to mention...

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:31.439
Consider this a way to
seal our deal.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.074
Call it my signature.

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.811
Death: Any objections?

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:40.515
Death: No?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.418
Well then let's start this
ritual, huh?

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.796
Come here.

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:29.864
Please, stop.

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:31.933
I can't!

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.988
Death: Hey hey! Blueballs is
here. Bluebeard is here.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.724
Death: Keep your eye out for
blondie and her dog.

01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:58.493
Death: Come on, rumpy.

01:14:58.495 --> 01:15:01.596
Death: Time for me and you to
get real cozy.

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:08.870
We don't hurt you.

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.707
You can't.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.689
We good?

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.730
I'm with you.

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.698
What's taking so long?

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:41.602
The sacrifice must be perfect,
my love.

01:15:41.604 --> 01:15:45.740
The circle must not be broken.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:48.209
Death: Oh my god! Whatever,
just hurry up.

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.115
- Really?

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:56.918
Goldie: You take neckbeard, I'll
take the others.

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:03.124
Ha ha! I'm disappointed, Wolfie.

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:05.560
Let me show you how it's done!

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.695
- Goldilocks, hurry!

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:12.066
Goldie!

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:14.068
I'm coming, Piper.
-Death: Oh, no you don't!

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.905
Alright, death. Give me
something to hit.

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:22.209
Alice: Oh no, Alice!
Open, dammit!

01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:25.112
He's lying!

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:28.049
He doesn't care about you.
-Liar!

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:29.784
Death: Witch, let's go.

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.153
He loves me.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:33.721
Goldie: Get him, hatter!

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:34.789
Goldie: Is something wrong,
sweetheart?

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:36.090
He's using you.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:37.592
Lie!

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.596
What do you think is gonna
happen when this is over, huh?

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:46.000
Death will enter
rumpelstiltskin for me.

01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:51.005
And then, we will be together
forever.

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:58.846
You obviously have no idea
what's gonna happen.

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:03.751
Death: No more talking.
Time for killing.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.189
Alice: There you have it.
Now, crackle.

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:17.098
Alice: I've had enough of you!

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:20.868
Are

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:21.769
you

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:22.770
quite

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:23.738
happy?

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.106
You can't win.

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:27.208
You should have
possessed a better brawler.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:30.277
Messenger: Nice punch. Do you
get a free bowl of porridge
with that?

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:35.349
Bluebeard: Come here, boy.

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.856
Cage match, then.

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:04.311
Death: Now you're really gonna
get it you blondie--

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.175
Goldie.

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:37.044
It's time.

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:57.031
Kill rumpelstiltskin!

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.037
Piper!

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.886
You're okay.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.521
You're alright.

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.391
Please be okay.

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:50.551
She's a bit much for you,
little girl.

01:19:55.557 --> 01:20:01.228
It's just...

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.939
Alice: You want to stop him?

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:17.444
Alice: I'm trusting you,
rumpelstiltskin.

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:20.347
No.

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:24.885
Alice: Tell me, how do we stop
this now?

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.823
Alice, no!

01:20:28.825 --> 01:20:31.225
Alice: Don't make
me regret this.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.611
Alice, what are you doing?
Kill him!

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:56.317
Blink twice if we have a deal.

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:12.933
Rumpelstiltskin!

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:23.878
Hurry, this body won't hold.

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.551
Alice, kill him!

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:33.087
I underestimated you.

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.656
Everyone does.

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:39.093
You sold us out, you
son of a bitch!

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.395
I get the underworld,

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:47.401
and you get my body as soon
as we shake.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.372
Don't let them touch!

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:55.209
Deal?

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.681
Deal.

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:22.469
What happened?

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.438
What did you do?

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.140
What he told me to.

01:22:26.142 --> 01:22:28.542
He said to blow up the wristband
when they shook hands.

01:22:28.544 --> 01:22:31.445
And I'd be rid of them both.

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:34.281
Not like him to sacrifice for
the greater good.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.116
No, no it's not.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:39.253
- Piper!

01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:40.521
Did we win?

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:44.391
- Piper.

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:50.230
How are you alive?

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.600
Ow.

01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:04.645
I wonder what rumpelstiltskin
got out of the deal?

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:55.429
Ah.

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:57.598
Messenger: Truce!

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:05.172
Alice: Rumpelstiltskin, i
presume. So that was your
scheme?

01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:07.174
Rumpy: Aww, look at them.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.376
Rumpy: So happy.

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.378
So alive!

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.548
<i>Rumpy: Thanks to me, of course.</i>

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:18.352
<i> See, things are under "new</i>
<i> management" downstairs.</i>

01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:22.222
<i> It's not as sinister as you</i>
<i> assumed, Alice.</i>

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.191
<i> I gave a few souls back.</i>

01:24:24.193 --> 01:24:27.194
<i>Maybe you can make something out</i>
<i> of them.</i>

01:24:27.196 --> 01:24:31.265
<i>Your own little sinister squad.</i>

01:24:31.267 --> 01:24:33.400
You want to make a deal?

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:37.404
I already got everything
i needed...

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.506
From you.

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:44.211
Rumpy: Consider this a freebie.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.480
A peace offering.

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:54.221
Don't forget, I know you tried
to sell me out.

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.593
Oh, Alice.

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:04.598
You're cleverer than that.

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:12.406
Hopefully after this we can
trust each other a little more.

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:19.880
I tell you what. I
can make you a deal.

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:22.816
Rumpy: A real no brainer.

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:30.357
You keep an eye on
everything up there.

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:37.698
And I'll keep an eye on things,
down here.

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.271
Better the devil you know, then?

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.740
Something like that.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:51.912
Too-do-loo wonder-bread.

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:22.943
Ah.

01:26:22.945 --> 01:26:24.945
Ha, ha!
