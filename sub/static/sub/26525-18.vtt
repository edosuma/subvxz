00:01.392 --> 00:03.046
Previously onSupergirl...

00:06.006 --> 00:08.573
Referrals for
post-trauma psychologists.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.053
Kelly,
I said I'm fine.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.446
Put this on first.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.361
You really look
exactly like her.

00:13.404 --> 00:14.797
My fellow Americans,

00:14.840 --> 00:17.104
the heart of our great nation was attacked...

00:17.147 --> 00:20.629
Supergirl, you are now
public enemy number one.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.196
We know
you didn't do this.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.632
We're gonna
find out the truth.

00:23.675 --> 00:24.720
Together.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.723
My fellow Americans,

00:27.766 --> 00:31.118
it has been a day
since Supergirl's attack
on the White House.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.989
In apparent retaliation

00:33.033 --> 00:36.079
for our repeal
of the Alien Amnesty Act.

00:36.123 --> 00:40.214
While she and those with whom she conspired remain at large,

00:40.257 --> 00:41.954
I have an obligation

00:41.998 --> 00:44.696
to ensure the safety
of all citizens.

00:45.610 --> 00:49.049
So, at 1900 hours today,

00:49.092 --> 00:52.922
I am imposing a sundown
to sunup curfew.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.184
They better catch her.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.794
Supergirl did not do this.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.927
Humans caught loitering will be cited.

00:57.970 --> 01:01.104
Aliens will be stopped
by any means necessary.

01:01.148 --> 01:04.716
And to Supergirl,
turn yourself in.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.240
We do not want a war with you

01:06.283 --> 01:09.417
but we vow to use every asset in our power

01:09.460 --> 01:11.593
to see that justice is done.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.291
Justice? What a crock!

01:15.945 --> 01:18.295
Help! Somebody help!
I'm trapped.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.253
Someone's in trouble.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.384
I have to go.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.256
You heard the president,
it isn't safe.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.171
If the government
wants to stop me
from helping people,

01:24.214 --> 01:25.215
let them try.

01:40.796 --> 01:41.623
Here.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.410
This is a citizen's arrest.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.933
This man needs help.
Put the gun--

01:49.544 --> 01:52.547
Stop! What you saw
in the news,
that wasn't me.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.983
We saw the footage.

01:54.026 --> 01:54.853
You stay back, traitor.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.159
I'm not going to hurt any--

02:03.123 --> 02:04.385
You're gonna kill someone.

02:04.428 --> 02:05.168
She's gonna kill us.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.517
Not if I kill her first.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.479
Are you okay?

02:12.958 --> 02:13.916
Thank you.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.441
But I don't get it.

02:18.573 --> 02:21.489
You saved my life
but you attacked
the White House?

02:21.532 --> 02:23.534
My daughter saw that.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.145
You were her hero and you...

02:25.884 --> 02:26.972
You crushed her.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.770
I mean, people
actually believe

02:41.813 --> 02:43.511
that I attacked
the White House.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.034
They think I'm a terrorist.

02:46.557 --> 02:50.344
Years of helping people
just wiped away with one lie.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.389
No, not one lie,
it's lots of lies.

02:52.433 --> 02:55.218
And Ben Lockwood
has been telling whoppers
for months.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
He's just creating division.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.917
And then most of the country
is just terrified

02:58.961 --> 03:01.398
and now they're looking
for solutions to make
any sense of it.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.444
Shouldn't the truth
matter more?

03:03.487 --> 03:05.315
Not when Lex is involved.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.666
He's an expert at perception.
Consummate gaslighter.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.626
He can make you doubt things
that you know are true.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.280
Listen, I really
believe that

03:13.323 --> 03:14.890
the three of us
working together

03:14.933 --> 03:17.371
is our best chance of
vindicating you
and catching him.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.937
Okay, so how did he do it?

03:18.981 --> 03:21.418
We know it wasn't Bizarro,
I already checked.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.986
Shapeshifter, hologram?
Image inducer...

03:24.029 --> 03:26.293
No, that can't be right.
The heat signatures
don't match.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.816
I don't understand.

03:28.512 --> 03:29.687
What is he up to?

03:29.731 --> 03:31.341
I don't know.
But we will find the truth

03:31.385 --> 03:32.560
and we will bring him down.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.953
All right, and to that end
I've got a lead.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.739
But it comes from my mother.

03:37.782 --> 03:42.134
She said that Lex's escape
from Stryker's Island prison
wasn't his first.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.441
That he's been coming
and going as he pleases
for months.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.529
So someone's been helping him.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.009
The warden.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.578
Warden!

03:50.621 --> 03:52.101
Sorry to interrupt.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.233
Supergirl.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.541
I assume you're here
with Ms. Luthor

03:57.585 --> 03:59.413
to turn yourself in.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.502
You might want
to rethink that.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.895
Bribery and tax evasion
are felonies.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.289
So is helping a criminal
like Lex Luthor.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.160
Where is he?

04:09.161 --> 04:10.337
Don't be ridiculous.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.122
Account number 832591290

04:13.165 --> 04:14.341
in the Cayman Islands.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.604
Okay.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.520
I may have taken some money.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.564
But I don't know where he is.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.349
You let him come and go.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.828
He never told me
where he went.

04:23.872 --> 04:24.916
You never thought to ask?

04:24.960 --> 04:26.309
All I did was turn
a blind eye

04:26.353 --> 04:27.789
and that was after
he threatened to kill me.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.530
Oh, please, he does
that to everyone.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.446
But there's nothing here.
The FBI already checked
his cell.

04:32.489 --> 04:33.708
They also checked you.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.449
So maybe they missed
something else.

04:35.492 --> 04:39.191
You expect me to march
America's most wanted
past my guards?

04:39.235 --> 04:41.803
The DOD will be all over us
in no time.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.500
Well, then you can
give them a distraction.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.807
And while we search Lex's cell

04:45.850 --> 04:47.417
you'll have time to call
your husband

04:47.461 --> 04:49.027
before you're both arrested.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.987
My husband had
nothing to do with this.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.381
-He doesn't know anything
about the account.
- Fine.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.339
So you give us access
to Lex's cell,

04:56.383 --> 04:59.386
and we'll leave your husband
out of it when we contact
the authorities.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.477
I could clear the guards
out of D block

05:03.520 --> 05:04.869
for two hours.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.577
Lex's cell is through
that door.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.668
Nice fireworks
in DC, Supergirl.

05:20.711 --> 05:21.973
That wasn't me.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.585
This place is for criminals
not terrorists.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.588
Okay, keep walking.
Stay strong.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.764
Welcome to Stryker's,
Supergirl.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.201
Supergirl.

05:32.244 --> 05:35.813
Supergirl. Supergirl.

05:35.857 --> 05:39.208
Supergirl. Supergirl.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.219
Wow.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.395
It's Hannibal Crossing
the Alps.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.744
So pretentious.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.140
It's so unnerving
being around all Lex's stuff.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.577
Brings back memories
of my miserable childhood.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.711
Even has the same
chess board.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.460
What are you doing?

06:13.503 --> 06:15.810
I know it sounds silly
but when we were little,

06:15.853 --> 06:19.640
Lex and I used to leave
notes for each other
inside chess pieces.

06:21.685 --> 06:22.425
Here it is.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.654
Time of death 4:03 a.m.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.051
What is it?

06:40.095 --> 06:42.924
Nothing, it's just Lex
trying to mess
with my head.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.404
And the number
on the back?

06:44.447 --> 06:47.755
-7/16/18. A date?
-Yes, it's...

06:47.798 --> 06:50.453
July 16, 1918.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.456
It's the date that Romanovs
were executed in Russia.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.458
Lex used to call me
the Lost Princess.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.808
Just like Anastasia.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.640
It's a checkmate pattern.

07:04.685 --> 07:05.642
Anastasia's me.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.788
Lex's diaries.

07:20.831 --> 07:23.094
Why would he leave them?

07:23.138 --> 07:24.966
Because he knew
I'd come looking for him.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.228
And he loves to torment me.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.708
He knew the last thing
I'd wanna do

07:27.751 --> 07:30.362
would be to go swimming
in his memories.

07:30.406 --> 07:33.627
He's sick, and he's twisted
but at least he's consistent.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.550
Lockwood.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.421
Secretary Lockwood now

07:45.465 --> 07:48.468
of the cabinet-level
Department of Alien Affairs.

07:48.511 --> 07:51.819
Should be inmate 42053
of the National City prison.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.211
So good to see you, too.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.344
Mr. Secretary, how can
we help you?

07:55.387 --> 07:58.434
I am here to requisition
any alien technology

07:58.478 --> 08:01.829
or weapons that may assist
in containing Supergirl.

08:01.872 --> 08:04.614
And then you'll
summon Supergirl

08:05.006 --> 08:05.920
here.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.617
So you can ambush her?

08:09.706 --> 08:12.056
So we can serve justice.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.624
Even if we could
summon Supergirl,

08:14.668 --> 08:16.321
I would need
a presidential order to comply

08:16.365 --> 08:19.020
with your request,
as per paragraph four
subsection A

08:19.063 --> 08:20.195
of the DEO charter.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.849
Isn't that correct, Colonel?

08:23.241 --> 08:25.330
That is the protocol.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.594
Then we'd be happy to comply.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.204
Okay, let me ask you
a question.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.772
Are you absolutely certain
that you want to waste
my time?

08:31.815 --> 08:35.558
We may not know
each other well,
Mr. Lockwood,

08:35.602 --> 08:39.344
but I do things by the book,
even for secretaries.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.751
Alpha team,
to the armory now.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.362
Colonel, why are you
capitulating?

08:57.406 --> 08:59.234
We just got him
to back off.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.628
If the president sent him,
he'll be back with the order
in no time.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.369
We both know that
Supergirl is innocent.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.981
It's not our job
to question, Director,

09:07.024 --> 09:09.549
which is why I need you
to hand over the signal watch

09:09.592 --> 09:11.638
Supergirl gave you.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.814
If we are in possession
of a way to summon Supergirl,

09:13.857 --> 09:14.858
we have to use it.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.340
Orders are orders.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.954
Press it twice,
she gets the alert.

09:25.782 --> 09:26.653
Hello.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.439
I'll be right there.

09:30.482 --> 09:34.008
You told
Colonel Haley to press
the signal watch twice.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.705
Yes. You know
the code.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.012
Push it once she comes,
push it twice,

09:38.882 --> 09:40.449
it's a trap, don't come.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.842
Thus keeping her safe.

09:42.712 --> 09:43.931
Brilliant.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.628
Yet Supergirl
isn't the only one
at risk.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.109
Since Benjamin Lockwood
has come for her today,

09:48.152 --> 09:49.763
there is a high probability

09:49.806 --> 09:51.721
that next week he'll come
for the entire alien registry.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.245
-Yeah.
-After which he'll start
rounding up aliens

09:54.289 --> 09:56.596
without discrimination,
ergo I propose

09:58.467 --> 10:00.643
we scrub the alien registry
from our database.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.951
If that's what you think,

10:03.994 --> 10:06.997
and until I can get
Haley to listen to reason,

10:07.041 --> 10:08.825
then we need to do
whatever we can.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.871
But please, Agent Dox,

10:10.914 --> 10:12.307
be clandestine.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.048
Of course.

10:14.091 --> 10:17.399
As you well know,
no one is more clandestine
than I.

10:17.965 --> 10:18.966
No one.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.583
Nervous?

10:28.149 --> 10:29.716
Not at all.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.066
I've just canceled
three times in my head
already today,

10:32.109 --> 10:33.676
so there's that.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.680
Doctor Park is the best
trauma therapist
in National City.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.248
She practically wrote
the book on PTSD.

10:40.291 --> 10:43.077
Still it's hard, I know.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.861
I have seen soldiers

10:45.819 --> 10:48.648
paralyzed over
what you're about to do.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.436
I am so proud of you.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.614
And Dad would be, too.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.104
Thank you.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.762
Thank you.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.119
Alex, hi.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.078
Of course.

11:29.950 --> 11:30.907
I'll see you then.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.518
Thank you
for meeting me.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.477
Any time.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.174
So what's up?

11:37.218 --> 11:40.525
I wanted to get your advice
on something,
being a therapist.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.093
I'm sorry, I hope
that's not weird
that I asked.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.183
I can make
a one-time exception
for a friend.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.576
Okay.

11:49.447 --> 11:50.971
My commanding officer and I

11:51.014 --> 11:53.408
both agree that we think
that something suspicious

11:53.451 --> 11:55.627
is going on at the Department
of Alien Affairs,

11:55.671 --> 11:57.325
and I am trying to tell her

11:57.368 --> 11:59.631
that we can't just follow
their every order

11:59.675 --> 12:02.547
but she insists
on the chain of command.

12:02.591 --> 12:05.463
And I don't know
how to reach her.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.423
Well, can I take a stab?

12:08.466 --> 12:09.772
Please.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.731
You need to stop
getting angry

12:12.035 --> 12:13.776
and get smart.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.779
Okay, now, I had a real jerk
of a CO.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.563
We were stationed
at a checkpoint

12:18.607 --> 12:19.869
on the outskirts of Bashur.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.612
And one day,
a man pulled up

12:23.655 --> 12:25.701
in this decrepit pickup,

12:25.745 --> 12:28.008
his pregnant wife
in the back,

12:28.051 --> 12:30.750
and he's just trying
to get to the only midwife
in the region.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.664
Just half a mile
across town.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.231
And the CO doesn't care.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.278
Rules are rules
and he doesn't have
the right papers.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.975
So what did you do?

12:39.019 --> 12:41.978
I yelled and screamed
about doing the right thing

12:42.022 --> 12:43.675
and got nowhere.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.808
But my sergeant
convinced the CO

12:45.852 --> 12:47.897
that it would be safer
for his unit

12:47.941 --> 12:50.639
not to risk the life
of the man's wife and child.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.642
He knew what the CO
cared most about.

12:53.990 --> 12:54.948
His men.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.297
Hmm.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.865
You can't change people.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.824
But you can appeal
to who they are.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.087
Even the toughest COs
care about something.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.792
Let me guess, right now
you're wishing that you
never called me.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.185
Actually,
it's quite the opposite.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.927
I'm really glad
you didn't leave.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.978
The root server
containing the alien registry

13:25.021 --> 13:27.284
is located in a vault
on sub-level five.

13:27.328 --> 13:30.461
Authorized personnel
have to pass through
a series of security checks.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.899
First, a voiceprint
identification.

13:32.942 --> 13:36.685
Thankfully Colonel Haley
is good at talking, and I am
good at recording.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.817
Colonel Haley.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.952
Next, a retinal scan.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.867
I can scramble the pattern
of the retina

13:44.911 --> 13:47.000
in my image inducer
to confuse the gateway
computer.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.872
Then the most challenging step.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.874
The guarded elevator.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.268
From studying Ethan Hunt,
master of the impossible
mission,

13:54.311 --> 13:57.619
the obvious answer
to bypass the guards
would be subterfuge.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.885
Yes, Colonel Haley,
I'm hurrying there
as we speak.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.582
Colonel Haley,
she's very impatient.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.019
Need something.
Sub-level five.

14:21.425 --> 14:24.124
What if my actions
are discovered?

14:24.167 --> 14:28.693
And the powers that be
retaliate by coming down
even harder on the aliens.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.132
Then again,
if I don't delete it,

14:32.175 --> 14:34.917
Alien Affairs will
immediately target
my friends

14:34.961 --> 14:36.092
for deportation.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.399
And if I do delete it,

14:38.442 --> 14:40.009
well, then what's to stop
the government

14:40.053 --> 14:42.142
from finding a new way
to target them?

14:42.185 --> 14:44.057
Ah, spruck!

14:45.797 --> 14:48.148
There is a perfect
50/50 chance

14:48.191 --> 14:49.932
that what I am
about to do

14:50.933 --> 14:52.152
is absolutely wrong.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.938
Well...

14:55.982 --> 14:57.505
If there is no mathematical
solution

14:57.548 --> 14:59.289
then perhaps I should
find a more...

15:01.204 --> 15:02.423
creative one.

15:02.466 --> 15:03.903
These are just
monthly expenses.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.689
Payoffs to half the guards
and all of the inmates.

15:09.038 --> 15:12.694
This one's all about Superman
and his supposed failings.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.914
It's infuriating.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.093
What is it?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.704
It's from my childhood.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.314
It's an inventory

15:24.358 --> 15:27.013
of all the faults
and mistakes I've made
since I was four.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.668
This is how he operates.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.801
I get flooded with emotion
and he wins.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.022
I don't think I can do this.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.679
Uh...

15:41.723 --> 15:43.986
We have a peeping Tom
across the way.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.688
You think he knows anything?

15:51.472 --> 15:53.169
I get that I should
be grateful.

15:54.214 --> 15:54.997
And I am.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.086
But?

15:58.261 --> 15:59.088
But I'm pissed.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.047
I know I need to be here

16:01.917 --> 16:03.310
but this just feels...

16:07.314 --> 16:08.271
I'm Guardian

16:09.794 --> 16:11.535
and I protect people.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.016
And people look
up to me when...

16:14.060 --> 16:17.498
Do you feel like you
don't deserve help?

16:17.541 --> 16:19.413
I feel like I shouldn't
need help.

16:19.456 --> 16:22.198
I feel like I should be
strong enough to just
get over this.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.072
Of course if you have
a magic pill I'll take it.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.117
Sadly, this process takes time.

16:28.161 --> 16:32.078
For today, I can give you
a starting point to deal
with anxiety

16:32.121 --> 16:34.123
or any negative feelings
that may come up.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.386
A calming tool.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.041
Okay, sure.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.435
It's called
bilateral stimulation.

16:41.478 --> 16:45.134
So if you start experiencing
symptoms, it can help
pull you back.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.051
Cross your arms
and interlock your fingers.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.143
Breathe in.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.278
Breathe out.

17:00.584 --> 17:01.455
Tap.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.065
Tap.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.241
Tap.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.242
Tap.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.245
Now, if you're comfortable,

17:09.289 --> 17:12.335
think of a place
where you feel safe.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.178
Use the tool, James.

17:29.439 --> 17:30.745
Cross your arms,

17:30.788 --> 17:32.486
interlock your fingers,
breathe in.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.053
Tap.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.586
This is part of the process.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.283
It takes patience

17:48.023 --> 17:49.677
but it does work.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.200
I know it will.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.082
Hey, there.

18:04.213 --> 18:07.216
Neighbor to the infamous
Lex Luthor, huh?

18:07.260 --> 18:09.131
Oh, yeah,
it was a true privilege.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.133
I mean, you have
a great view.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.267
See anything suspicious
the last few weeks?

18:14.310 --> 18:17.226
Everything Lex did
was suspicious.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.229
And let me guess,
now you want me
to rat him out

18:20.273 --> 18:22.231
to his archnemesis?

18:22.275 --> 18:24.451
Think of how good
that will feel.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.627
To help finally
bring him to justice.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.064
You expect me to trust you?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.153
You are literally
a traitor.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.676
But what do you care, right?

18:32.720 --> 18:35.810
Waltzing in here
and putting a target
on all our backs.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.986
-Excuse me?
-The entire country

18:38.029 --> 18:39.422
is itching to nuke you.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.815
And when they do,

18:40.858 --> 18:42.512
guess who else
gets nuked?

18:42.556 --> 18:44.166
No, they wouldn't do that.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.298
They want to.

18:45.341 --> 18:48.127
Nobody cares about
the little people.

18:48.170 --> 18:52.087
Even if we're fighting
for justice by say,

18:52.131 --> 18:56.787
releasing classified documents
about illegal drone warfare.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.964
Wait. You're Steve Lomeli.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.012
You stole all that data
from the DOD.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.448
I exposed the truth.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.407
And I paid for it
with my freedom.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.322
Because, unlike you,

19:09.365 --> 19:10.627
I'm not above the law.

19:10.671 --> 19:11.933
That's ridiculous. I...

19:11.976 --> 19:13.630
Oh, really? How
many times has your

19:13.674 --> 19:16.242
unilateral
bull-in-a-china-shop approach

19:16.285 --> 19:19.114
destroyed exculpatory evidence?

19:20.376 --> 19:22.291
The term for someone like you

19:23.466 --> 19:25.338
is malignant narcissist.

19:26.469 --> 19:27.601
I help people.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.820
Oh, no, you don't.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.649
Everything you touch,
you ruin.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.961
Nia Nal, I understand
this interaction might
be difficult for you

19:40.004 --> 19:41.876
given that we haven't
spoken since our incredible

19:41.919 --> 19:44.313
yet devastating romantic
encounter at the hospital.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.010
Yeah, I've barely
been able to eat.

19:46.054 --> 19:49.362
Yes, well, I too have been
caught in quite a conundrum.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.973
Ben Lockwood is trying
to trap Supergirl.

19:52.016 --> 19:55.194
His next step will be
obtaining the alien registry.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.456
We could delete it right now,

19:56.499 --> 19:58.327
avoid that possibility,

19:58.371 --> 20:00.373
but that could backfire
and bring the government
down twice as hard.

20:00.416 --> 20:04.290
The odds are a perfect 50/50.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.161
What does your gut tell you?

20:06.205 --> 20:09.643
That decisions should
be made based on facts
and not

20:09.686 --> 20:13.386
intestinal inclinations.
Now, please tell me,

20:13.429 --> 20:14.822
what do I do?

20:15.649 --> 20:17.041
If you want my opinion--

20:17.085 --> 20:18.913
No, I do not,

20:18.956 --> 20:23.178
I want you to literally
tell me what I do.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.789
Dream the future
of the registry.

20:25.833 --> 20:28.096
Does it exist?
Does it not?

20:28.139 --> 20:30.054
If you tell me that,
then you tell me what I did

20:30.098 --> 20:31.578
so that I could do it.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.276
So when I want to know
about my
descendant's superpowers

20:34.320 --> 20:36.931
it's all "You'll destroy
the fabric of space and time."

20:36.974 --> 20:39.150
But when you want
to know the future it's--

20:39.194 --> 20:40.848
There is no other way.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.546
Fine.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.349
You don't destroy
the registry.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.307
That's ridiculous.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.614
Of course
I have to destroy it.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.051
Exactly.

21:11.748 --> 21:14.316
-What?
-That's the answer.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.839
You have to destroy
the registry.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.711
But you just
dreamt the opposite.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.626
I didn't dream anything.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.410
Sometimes hearing
the wrong answer

21:21.454 --> 21:22.933
shows you what
the right one is.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.023
Intestinal inclination.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.416
Not so bad, is it?

21:37.383 --> 21:39.167
Well, thank you,
Ms. Kim.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.516
I appreciate it.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.129
What is it, Director Danvers?

21:48.568 --> 21:49.743
Colonel.

21:49.786 --> 21:53.529
You've spent your life
in service.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.358
Everything you do
is for the good
of our country.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.447
You see that
as a moral imperative.

21:59.622 --> 22:02.495
But some orders
are immoral.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.497
And following them
does not make you
a good soldier,

22:04.540 --> 22:05.672
it makes you complicit.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.282
That is enough,
Director Danvers.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.502
Ben Lockwood wants
to ambush Supergirl.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.155
He wants to execute her.

22:11.199 --> 22:14.376
While you and I both know
that she's been falsely
accused.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.248
Look, I know that it's risky
to defy orders

22:18.424 --> 22:21.514
but you have much more
to consider than just
yourself here.

22:22.645 --> 22:23.690
What about your daughter?

22:23.733 --> 22:26.214
You leave my daughter
out of this.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.868
In all my months here
I've revealed to you

22:27.911 --> 22:30.436
exactly one piece
of personal information.

22:30.479 --> 22:31.828
One piece--

22:33.656 --> 22:36.442
And now you wanna use
that as leverage against me?

22:36.485 --> 22:37.617
-Colonel--
-Not to mention lying

22:37.660 --> 22:39.749
about the signal watch.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.491
Yes, I know
more than you think.
One click, she comes.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.101
Two clicks, she stays away.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.061
You're pushing your luck
here, Danvers,

22:47.104 --> 22:48.758
and one day you're going
to push it too far.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.718
Dismissed.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.598
Hey, there, Warden.

23:02.642 --> 23:05.514
Is Warden your first name
or your last?

23:05.558 --> 23:07.037
What are you doing here?

23:07.081 --> 23:08.648
Got an alert.

23:08.691 --> 23:11.868
Kryptonian in the boss' cell.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.657
Well, people
who used to admire me

23:17.700 --> 23:19.441
now think I am
an American traitor.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.660
And the people that hate me

23:20.703 --> 23:22.444
are reveling in my downfall.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.404
Okay, this is not
your downfall, Supergirl,
it's a glitch.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.579
You didn't do it.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.102
We both know Lex
is behind this,

23:28.145 --> 23:29.451
and soon everyone
else will, too.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.497
Okay, I know better
than anyone what it's like

23:31.540 --> 23:33.760
to be falsely accused
of a crime you didn't
commit, okay?

23:33.803 --> 23:35.675
It's not fun.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.372
No, it's not.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.983
But neither is reading through
your murderous brother's
journals

23:40.027 --> 23:41.811
and reliving
traumatic memories.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.900
Just looking
at Lex's handwriting

23:43.944 --> 23:45.511
is like needles in my eyes.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.470
Maybe this
is a wild-goose chase.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.732
Maybe there's no clue trail,

23:49.776 --> 23:52.561
just Lex torturing me
like he always does.

23:53.649 --> 23:54.694
Let's just get out of here.

23:54.737 --> 23:56.609
No. No, Lena, wait.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.698
People like you and me,
we don't give up.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.569
So we will find something

24:00.613 --> 24:02.049
and we're going
to stop him.

24:02.092 --> 24:06.445
Good morning, Cell Block D.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.098
-Is that--
-Otis Graves.

24:08.142 --> 24:11.275
Coming to you live
from WLEX.

24:11.319 --> 24:14.844
We have a giveaway
for one lucky caller.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.804
First person to apprehend
Supergirl

24:17.847 --> 24:22.591
gets a lifetime of not
being in prison anymore.

24:22.635 --> 24:25.942
Good luck.
Lines are opening now.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.743
We've got about
30 seconds before
there's a riot.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.614
-I'm gonna find Otis.
-Wait, I'm coming with you.

24:45.658 --> 24:48.574
No, no, the whole cell block
was just set free,
it's too dangerous.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.098
But that numskull's
our best hope
of finding Lex.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.316
Which is why I will go.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.753
You need to find out
what Lex is hiding.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.058
I'm gonna weld that
outside door

24:55.102 --> 24:56.625
so Otis can't get in.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.194
Before you go...
It's a Kryptonite shield.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.023
If Lex did bring
Otis back as Metallo,
you're gonna need it.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.375
Thanks.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.116
-Good luck.
-You too.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.904
As the nation
enters the second day
of martial law,

25:57.947 --> 26:00.733
food shortages and an uptick
in violent crime

26:00.776 --> 26:02.212
has been reported
across the country.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.699
Adding to this tension
is the escape of Lex Luthor,

26:10.743 --> 26:13.180
brother of L-Corp CEO,
Lena Luthor.

26:41.643 --> 26:44.254
Warden, we don't
have much time.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.865
I need you to help me find a--

26:50.434 --> 26:51.784
psychopath.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.657
You bastard.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.192
"Father lost
his temper again..."

27:09.236 --> 27:10.672
Lena.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.674
Get back here now!

27:12.718 --> 27:14.676
"Lena stole
his prized fountain pen
for me.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.766
The one presented to him
by the King of Jordan.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.032
Lena craves my attention.

27:23.467 --> 27:24.730
Pathetic.

27:26.949 --> 27:29.735
If she knew how brilliant she
was, she wouldn't need it."

27:37.220 --> 27:38.700
What if he finds us?

27:38.744 --> 27:40.659
Don't worry, he can't
climb when he's drunk.

27:40.702 --> 27:41.921
When I grow up,

27:41.964 --> 27:43.923
I'm gonna have
all the money in the world.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.533
And I'm gonna
build a house

27:45.576 --> 27:47.013
and I'm gonna keep
us safe forever.

27:47.796 --> 27:50.364
I'll build it right there.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.847
Those aren't the Alps.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.718
What are you
playing at, brother?

28:26.052 --> 28:27.531
Where's Otis Graves?

28:31.100 --> 28:33.146
Well, well, well.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.192
If it isn't
Lee Harvey Supergirl.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.849
Turns out it's easy
being green.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.638
You're not the only one
who's friends with a Luthor.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.512
My heart's grown
three sizes in here.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.456
President's orders, boys.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.806
If Supergirl's in there,
she is not coming out.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.811
They don't call it
the slammer for nothing.

29:34.598 --> 29:35.425
Aah!

30:08.023 --> 30:09.372
Supergirl!

30:15.074 --> 30:16.858
Here's Otis!

30:33.048 --> 30:33.962
Where'd Supergirl go?

30:34.006 --> 30:35.529
I don't know but I...

30:35.572 --> 30:38.010
I saw a red blur
go through that door.

30:42.884 --> 30:43.885
Wait a minute.

30:45.191 --> 30:48.847
D block's for guys only,
what are you doing here?

30:49.195 --> 30:50.849
I, uh...

30:51.327 --> 30:52.720
I'm a reporter.

30:52.763 --> 30:55.375
I was doing an interview
in the dining hall

30:55.418 --> 30:57.029
when the guards
rushed us out.

30:58.726 --> 31:02.382
The article's
on prison reform,
maybe you'd care to comment?

31:03.035 --> 31:04.906
I don't trust the press.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.647
They always parachute
into crises like this

31:06.690 --> 31:09.911
without any context
for the larger systemic
issues at play.

31:18.180 --> 31:18.877
Sun.

31:28.538 --> 31:29.800
What? What?

31:29.844 --> 31:31.802
-Don't move.
-I'm just a reporter.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.804
-Really, for whom?
-For CatComagazine.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.806
Wait, my name
is Kara Danvers.

31:35.850 --> 31:36.764
Kara Danvers?

31:38.548 --> 31:39.767
What are you doing?

31:39.810 --> 31:42.509
This is Kara Danvers,
the journalist.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.163
The one who writes

31:44.206 --> 31:46.992
that Aliens of National City
column that I read to you.

31:47.035 --> 31:50.169
And most of the other
good stuff in CatCo,too.

31:50.212 --> 31:51.561
Oh, thanks.

31:51.605 --> 31:52.954
Sorry about the shiv.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.217
But when a riot breaks out
in the block,

31:55.261 --> 31:57.176
you never know who
you're gonna run into.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.438
Steve Lomeli.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.440
Editor of Stryker's
one and only newsletter.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.050
The not-so-free press.

32:02.094 --> 32:05.053
It's nice to meet
another member
of the fourth estate.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.359
Pleasure's mine.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.796
So tell us, what brings
you to Stryker's?

32:08.839 --> 32:10.754
Off the record, of course.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.627
Uh...

32:13.670 --> 32:17.022
I'm actually... I'm writing
a piece about Lex Luthor.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.286
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about him, would you?

32:20.329 --> 32:22.114
You know,
you're the second person today

32:22.157 --> 32:23.506
to ask me about that psycho.

32:24.159 --> 32:25.291
Huh.

32:27.423 --> 32:30.600
Truth is, my cell is right
across from his.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.211
I could tell you
some things.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.126
-Deep background,
of course.
-Of course.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.911
Supergirl,
this is the National Guard.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.739
Come out
or we're coming in.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.046
Anyone in our way
will be shot.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.265
That's crazy. They can't
just come in here shooting

32:43.309 --> 32:45.093
when there's practically
a riot going on?

32:45.137 --> 32:48.227
You think the National Guard
gives a hoot about a bunch
of convicts?

32:48.270 --> 32:50.707
We are making our breach
in five seconds.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.753
Lay down flat
on the floor...

32:52.796 --> 32:54.320
-Come on, we better
get down.
-...hands behind your back.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.061
Uh, I have to go.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.106
- Five...
-Go? Are you crazy?

32:58.150 --> 32:59.542
Four...

33:00.108 --> 33:01.240
Three...

33:01.283 --> 33:02.110
Two...

33:03.068 --> 33:04.025
One. Go!

33:10.292 --> 33:11.554
Everybody, down!

33:20.476 --> 33:22.087
Move, move, move.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.008
Where is Supergirl?

33:34.142 --> 33:35.535
Lena?

33:35.578 --> 33:36.884
I'm here.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.075
What is this place?

34:11.701 --> 34:13.573
That's the DEO
desert facility.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.314
What are you up to, Lex?

34:15.357 --> 34:18.752
Don't worry, Mr. L.
I got it all under control.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.058
Oh, no.

34:20.449 --> 34:21.668
Otis.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.278
Yes, I am in your cell.

34:23.322 --> 34:27.413
And it looks great.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.937
Stand in the middle?
Yeah, sure.

34:37.510 --> 34:38.989
We've got to get out of here.

34:39.033 --> 34:40.948
We can't leave all this stuff.
We need it to find Lex.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.297
There's no time.

34:44.430 --> 34:48.695
And by "This is what you get,"
you mean what?

35:18.203 --> 35:19.378
-Nia--
- Brainy, I was wrong.

35:19.421 --> 35:20.422
You can't delete
the registry.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.164
Oh. Uh...

35:24.209 --> 35:26.036
-I didn't.
-Thank God.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.690
I had a dream
they came for you.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.344
I should clarify.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.828
I did, in fact,
erase the list

35:34.871 --> 35:37.135
from the DEO servers.
But seeing as how

35:37.178 --> 35:38.745
there may come a time
when we need it...

35:38.788 --> 35:40.225
I downloaded a copy.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.096
To my brain.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.142
Why would you do that?
Now you could be a target.

35:44.185 --> 35:47.014
Well, that's just the cost
of being a hero.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.495
Oh, Brainy, that's...

35:50.670 --> 35:53.238
That's actually
very heroic.

35:53.281 --> 35:55.065
-Hmm.
-You were right.

35:55.109 --> 35:57.372
I should've looked
into the future like
you'd asked.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.855
I have evolved
my views on this topic.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.118
The consequences
of seeing the future

36:04.162 --> 36:05.250
under consideration,

36:06.381 --> 36:08.427
doing the right thing

36:08.470 --> 36:09.950
is an imperative.

36:09.993 --> 36:11.865
Besides, the odds
of my arrest are actually
quite low

36:11.908 --> 36:15.782
seeing as how you're not
very good at interpreting
your dreams.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.001
I give it 40/60 at best.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.312
Make that 60/40.

36:24.356 --> 36:25.226
Brainy?

36:28.360 --> 36:30.318
Your presidential order,
Colonel.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.976
This will suffice,
Miss Walker.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.022
Oh, yeah.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See if this won't work
on Supergirl.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.678
Good.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.245
Don't be shy, gentlemen.
This is the good stuff.

36:45.420 --> 36:48.293
Nobody fires
without my direct order.

36:48.336 --> 36:49.946
And if she's smart,

36:49.990 --> 36:51.339
she'll come quietly.

36:54.473 --> 36:55.648
Okay.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.999
Summon Supergirl.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.143
So how long is this
supposed to take?

37:13.187 --> 37:15.320
Normally less than a minute.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.235
But it would appear as though
she has gone dark.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.499
Okay.

37:22.544 --> 37:24.285
What did you do?

37:24.329 --> 37:25.678
I followed your orders.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.379
Let's pack it up.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.253
Come on, pack it up.
All of it.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.648
We'll just be taking
the weapons with us.

37:47.656 --> 37:48.962
You pressed twice.

37:49.005 --> 37:50.268
I didn't do it for you.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.271
My daughter

37:54.054 --> 37:56.056
had a panic attack last night.

37:56.578 --> 37:57.927
She is scared

37:57.971 --> 38:00.495
of martial law and the curfew

38:01.714 --> 38:04.456
and the fact that her favorite
teacher has gone missing.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.676
He's an alien.

38:08.851 --> 38:12.159
And presumably in hiding.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.293
But I can't promise
her that, can I?

38:15.815 --> 38:17.512
No, you can't.

38:17.556 --> 38:20.515
I don't like being
manipulated by you

38:20.559 --> 38:22.735
or that power-hungry snake.

38:22.778 --> 38:25.041
You made the right choice.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.696
I prided myself
on my loyalty
to this country.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.179
What I wanted didn't
matter, it was about

38:32.832 --> 38:34.355
serving the greater good.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.535
Now, I wonder about

38:41.493 --> 38:42.711
the few...

38:44.583 --> 38:46.280
the ones left behind.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.110
Will my daughter
be one of them?

38:51.416 --> 38:54.462
She is looking to me for help

38:54.506 --> 38:58.466
and moral guidance
but how can I protect her

38:59.989 --> 39:01.426
if I am party to this?

39:09.477 --> 39:12.262
Authorities
have identified Supergirl
as the attacker

39:12.306 --> 39:14.656
in an attempt to free prisoners of Stryker's Island.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.484
Attempt to free prisoners?

39:16.528 --> 39:17.877
That's ridiculous.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.531
It's always a joy to see
the new and creative ways

39:19.574 --> 39:21.097
people find to hate
the good guys.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.535
That prisoner, Steve,

39:24.666 --> 39:25.537
he wasn't wrong.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.063
I did make things worse.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.413
How many prisoners almost
died today because of me?

39:32.457 --> 39:34.415
I put you in jeopardy
at the prison.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.156
And you were in jeopardy
at the DEO.

39:36.199 --> 39:38.201
It's clear I am doing

39:38.245 --> 39:40.421
more harm than good
right now.

39:43.119 --> 39:45.644
So I think
it's time Supergirl

39:45.687 --> 39:47.167
lay low.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.690
There are other ways
to get to the truth.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.920
James, I got
your message.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.835
It sounded urgent.
What's up?

40:02.878 --> 40:04.924
It happened again.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.882
But this time I could
see 500 feet.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.710
Like it was right
in front of me.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.930
And I could hear things

40:10.973 --> 40:12.758
that nobody should
be able to hear.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.151
It could be a hallucination.

40:15.195 --> 40:16.457
Those are known symptoms.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.893
I would love
to believe that.

40:17.937 --> 40:20.505
I would, but this was too real.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.424
We have to talk to Lena.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.165
This is more than PTSD.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.213
She destroyed a prison.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.128
She outsmarted the DEO.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.695
Somehow she knew
we were coming.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.001
She always seems to be
one step ahead of us.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.699
I need people I can trust

40:40.742 --> 40:42.178
if you want me
to bring her down.

40:42.222 --> 40:43.832
Go ahead.

40:43.876 --> 40:46.574
Deputize
the Children of Liberty.

40:53.929 --> 40:56.758
-Oh!
- Yes,
you were detonated.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.499
But we put you
back together

40:58.543 --> 40:59.457
again.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.897
Thank you
for meeting with me.

41:04.940 --> 41:08.770
Ah! What an honor
to be interviewed
by Kara Danvers.

41:08.814 --> 41:11.033
Just make sure it stays
off the record, okay?

41:11.077 --> 41:13.558
Oh, deep, deep background,
I promise.

41:13.949 --> 41:15.081
It's a shame

41:15.124 --> 41:16.517
Lex's secret prison lab

41:16.561 --> 41:18.954
was destroyed by that
Otis Graves.

41:20.652 --> 41:23.655
But since there's no
such thing as a secure
Wi-Fi network

41:23.698 --> 41:24.917
with me in the building...

41:28.703 --> 41:30.313
Lex's hard drive.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.794
Everything that
was on the computer
in that secret room.

41:32.838 --> 41:34.274
Thank you, Steve.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.494
I'm just grateful
you're bringing him
to justice.

41:36.537 --> 41:39.758
I'm grateful I have
the tools to do it.

41:39.801 --> 41:42.021
There's nothing more powerful
in the pursuit of justice

41:42.064 --> 41:43.457
than the power of the press.

41:44.414 --> 41:45.677
What do they say?

41:45.720 --> 41:47.722
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

41:50.725 --> 41:52.858
Maybe even mightier
than a cape.
