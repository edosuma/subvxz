00:44.360 --> 00:48.160
- You mustn't make him wait forever.
- I love him.

00:48.900 --> 00:52.530
I'd accept him in a trice
if it weren't for Marigold.

00:52.580 --> 00:57.660
- You say he'll let you keep her.
- That's not the problem. - What is?

00:58.940 --> 01:03.730
If I stay silent, there's a lie
at the heart of my marriage.

01:03.780 --> 01:07.650
But if I tell him the
truth, will I ruin it?

01:07.700 --> 01:13.370
Edith, you're a grown woman
and I can't force you.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.850
But you cannot be married to a man and
leave him out of a secret like this.

01:16.900 --> 01:23.300
- It's not possible and you won't be happy.
- How happy am I now?

01:28.660 --> 01:32.010
Mrs Patmore, you are the owner of
No.3 Orchard Lane, Haughton-le-Skerne.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.530
I am. I'm running it as a
bed-and-breakfast place.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.890
Among your guests, was a certain
Doctor Fletcher and his wife?

01:37.940 --> 01:42.130
They were my first. Very courteous
and respectable, I must say.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.330
Not as respectable as you think.

01:44.380 --> 01:49.770
- Dr Fletcher was a Mr Ian McKidd
and his 'wife' a Mrs Dorrit. - What?

01:49.820 --> 01:53.810
Mr Dorrit is now suing Mr McKidd
for damages related to adultery.

01:53.860 --> 01:58.140
- You may be called upon to testify.
- Oh, my God.

02:00.540 --> 02:04.210
There is some concern
Haughton-le-Skerne will be in the news,

02:04.260 --> 02:07.260
as a site of a house of ill repute.

02:08.740 --> 02:11.170
A house of ill repute?

02:11.220 --> 02:13.490
I'm afraid the rumour
mill has already begun...

02:13.540 --> 02:17.330
but there's a chance that
Dorrit may settle out of court.

02:17.380 --> 02:20.660
- I'll keep you informed.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

02:24.940 --> 02:27.410
Hello. What brings you here?

02:27.460 --> 02:31.890
Oh, Mrs Patmore's the one to ask.

02:31.940 --> 02:34.460
A house of ill repute?

02:36.700 --> 02:40.410
Mama is swanning around the South of
France without a word to any of us.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.250
- I wish Cora --
- I won't hear a word against Cora.

02:43.300 --> 02:47.730
- Mama is being impossible. - I was going to
say, "I wish Cora wouldn't take it to heart."

02:47.780 --> 02:51.060
Mama has exhausted my patience this time.

02:51.700 --> 02:56.340
- But she did give you Teo.
- True. I forgive her everything.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.690
Do you think he will marry Edith?

03:10.740 --> 03:13.250
If he learns about Marigold?

03:13.300 --> 03:15.770
I just don't want her to be hurt.

03:26.340 --> 03:30.050
- Is that it, then?
- Yes, let's go.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.810
- Isn't Bertie's employer
always in Tangiers? - Hmm.

03:32.860 --> 03:34.860
Can you buy one?

03:36.820 --> 03:38.820
Thank you.

03:42.740 --> 03:46.010
(READS) The 6th Marquess of Hexham,
39, has died on holiday in Tangiers

03:46.060 --> 03:48.010
where he was a frequent visitor.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.690
The cause is given as Malaria.
Lord Hexham was unmarried.

03:50.740 --> 03:54.170
- Does this mean Bertie's out of a job?
- That depends on the heir.

03:54.220 --> 03:58.370
Poor Edith. It was bad enough he was
an agent. Now he may not be that.

03:58.420 --> 04:00.820
Don't sound so gleeful about it.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.570
- You should have seen her face.
- It wasn't very funny for Mrs Patmore.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.610
- No. And I'm not laughing, but --
- But, you're laughing.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.330
(BURSTS INTO A FIT OF GIGGLES)

04:09.380 --> 04:14.970
- How many classes will you be taking
every week? - Five to start with.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.370
Only afternoons between
half-two and half-four.

04:17.420 --> 04:21.740
- What does Mr Carson say?
- I haven't asked him yet.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.770
Don't ask him, tell him.

04:24.820 --> 04:28.820
But suppose it doesn't work
out? Suppose I'm no good?

04:29.980 --> 04:32.090
Of course I didn't know
they'd invited you.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.130
- I would have mentioned it.
- Nobody has been as rude to me as your son.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.450
Why in God's name would
he want me at his wedding?

04:37.500 --> 04:40.410
- Well, isn't it a good sign?
- I'm not sure what it's a sign of.

04:40.460 --> 04:45.810
- Amelia's influence.
- Ah. Yes. I think I agree.

04:45.860 --> 04:50.970
- She is a very kind and gentle soul.
- Is she? Is she, indeed?

04:51.020 --> 04:55.700
- Don't you think so?
- To be honest, I don't know her.

04:57.580 --> 05:01.330
It was all I could do not to
burst out laughing. Poor thing.

05:01.380 --> 05:04.530
Is it funny? Suppose someone makes
a connection between Mrs Patmore

05:04.580 --> 05:07.410
- and her place at Downton Abbey?
- I'm sure they won't.

05:07.460 --> 05:12.210
We should PRAY they don't. I don't
want this story repeated upstairs.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.700
I'm not going to tell them.

05:17.020 --> 05:19.010
(BOTH LAUGH HEARTILY)

05:19.060 --> 05:22.090
Oh, that's the first proper
laugh I've had for ages.

05:22.140 --> 05:24.890
- I couldn't resist telling you.
- Poor Mrs Patmore.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.340
Oh, I know. It's awful for her.

05:29.060 --> 05:32.410
I'm going to have to think of
something serious when I go down.

05:32.460 --> 05:37.530
I had some rather sad news when we
were in Thirsk. Lord Hexham's died.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.130
- Who's that, M'Lady?
- The owner of Brancaster Castle,

05:40.180 --> 05:42.450
where we all stayed last
year. For the grouse.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.850
Not me, M'Lady. I was...
otherwise detained.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.170
Oh, of course you were. I am sorry.

05:47.220 --> 05:51.170
Only it might affect Lady
Edith's friend, Mr Pelham.

05:51.220 --> 05:55.210
He's the agent there. Or was.
He might be out of a job.

05:55.260 --> 05:57.330
How worrying for them.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.730
My romance might not be the only
one to come to an untimely end.

06:00.780 --> 06:05.770
- Have you heard from Mr Talbot?
- No. But that's a good thing.

06:05.820 --> 06:08.810
- It means he's accepted my decision.
- Which is what you want?

06:08.860 --> 06:11.130
Which is exactly what I want.

06:12.380 --> 06:15.050
Oh, I just can't get the
phrase out of my head.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.650
- It just goes round and round.
- A house of ill repute.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.890
Yes, I know what it is, thank you!

06:20.940 --> 06:22.490
Yes, I see.

06:22.540 --> 06:26.970
- Ah, Mr Dawes has got some news for you.
- Do I want to know?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.380
Read it for yourself.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.770
You passed every paper with high marks.

06:33.820 --> 06:36.290
Oh, Daisy. That's wonderful news.

06:39.180 --> 06:42.450
Poor Mr Pelham. First that
terrible day at the racetrack,

06:42.500 --> 06:45.890
- and then to hear his cousin's died.
- It does seem very hard.

06:45.940 --> 06:49.610
- Did you get hold of him?
- Yes.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.650
He's coming tomorrow, on the first
leg of his trip to Tangiers.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.410
- I've asked him here.
- Good.

06:54.460 --> 06:59.850
- How is he? - Sad. He loved his
cousin, and it was all so quick.

06:59.900 --> 07:03.610
The trouble is they've already buried
him and Bertie's not sure what to do.

07:03.660 --> 07:06.570
It's ordinary in hot countries.
It won't mean any disrespect.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.930
No, but, should they leave him there?

07:09.980 --> 07:13.060
Surely the decision is down to
the new Marquess not to Bertie.

07:14.700 --> 07:21.060
Well, that's the thing. He
is the new Marquess... Bertie.

07:22.820 --> 07:27.170
- Bertie Pelham is now the
Marquess of Hexham? - Yes.

07:27.220 --> 07:30.810
Nonsense. He's having you on. He'd
have told you if he was the heir.

07:30.860 --> 07:33.730
He did tell me. But his
cousin was in his 30s

07:33.780 --> 07:35.930
and they all knew the
girl he was going to marry.

07:35.980 --> 07:39.170
But that's absurd! If Bertie's
a marquess, then Edith --

07:39.220 --> 07:42.370
Edith would outrank us
all. Yes. That's right.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.130
- Was he a close relation?
- Second cousin, once removed.

07:46.180 --> 07:49.610
Nobody thought it was possible he
would inherit. Least of all Bertie.

07:49.660 --> 07:54.010
- He seemed like a nice young man to me.
- And getting nicer by the minute.

07:54.060 --> 07:56.770
- With a love of Brancaster.
- Golly gum drops! What a turn-up.

07:56.820 --> 07:59.690
- (SITTING ROOM DOORS OPEN)
- That's dinner.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.280
If we're not too distracted to eat.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.730
- We'll all bow and curtsy to Edith.
You'll enjoy that, Mary. - Hardly(!)

08:07.780 --> 08:10.410
And if Bertie IS Lord Hexham
which I still don't believe,

08:10.460 --> 08:12.970
- he won't want to marry her now.
- Careful.

08:13.020 --> 08:16.500
People will think you're jealous,
dear. We don't want that.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.130
- It's only a try-out, Mr Carson.
- Every day you'd leave at two?

08:28.180 --> 08:31.450
And I'd be back by five. So I
could serve dinner and luncheon.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.450
- No lingering over the pudding.
- Mr Barrow is still here --

08:34.500 --> 08:37.210
- Oh, don't we know it.
- But if lunch does go on a bit,

08:37.260 --> 08:40.809
there's still Andrew and Mr
Barrow and you to see to it.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.090
And what makes you think
you'll be any good?

08:43.140 --> 08:45.690
I don't know exactly. Perhaps
because I want it so much.

08:45.740 --> 08:48.810
There are plenty of little boys
who want to be famous cricketers.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.090
It's not enough to make them champions.

08:51.140 --> 08:55.140
- I just want to try, Mr Carson.
- And so you shall.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.330
(LAUGHS)

09:01.380 --> 09:04.130
How terrible. Poor Mrs Patmore.

09:04.180 --> 09:08.820
- What an unlikely bawdy house madam.
- Mrs Patmore's secret career.

09:10.420 --> 09:13.820
- We mustn't joke when Bertie's here.
- We'll have long faces, don't worry.

09:14.860 --> 09:18.250
- I had a call from Henry earlier.
- Henry? Why didn't you say?

09:18.300 --> 09:21.370
- I'm saying now.
- How is he?

09:21.420 --> 09:25.730
Mourning Charlie Rogers. Missing you.

09:25.780 --> 09:28.050
You're not to ask him to come here.

09:28.100 --> 09:33.650
- Suppose he just turns up?
- Don't encourage him, Tom. I mean it.

09:33.700 --> 09:37.180
- We'd be wretched long term.
- And you're not wretched now?

09:39.100 --> 09:42.130
- Mary thinks he'll throw me over.
- I don't see why.

09:42.180 --> 09:45.890
It's surely very encouraging he's
coming here on his way to London.

09:45.940 --> 09:50.810
Unless it's to break with me so he
can start afresh. He's not bound.

09:50.860 --> 09:52.860
I haven't accepted him.

09:54.220 --> 09:59.050
- Have you told him about Marigold?
- Not yet.

09:59.100 --> 10:02.570
Make a clean breast of it. Please.

10:02.620 --> 10:08.220
- You'll regret it if you don't.
- With my luck, I'll regret it either way.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.140
What are you doing?

10:20.900 --> 10:22.610
Oh. Er...

10:22.660 --> 10:26.210
Making time charts and setting
some tests for comprehension.

10:26.260 --> 10:31.490
- Tests? For the village children?
- You're not expecting too much?

10:31.540 --> 10:34.210
- Who wants cocoa? - I think if
you expect a lot, you get a lot.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.930
- BATES: No, thank you, Mrs
Patmore. - Good night. - Good night.

10:36.980 --> 10:41.730
- How are you feeling?
- I'm still shaken. I can't deny it.

10:41.780 --> 10:44.810
- Is your poor niece managing?
- I'm going over to see her tomorrow.

10:44.860 --> 10:47.100
I'll come with you.

10:48.220 --> 10:52.050
A genuine, copper-bottomed marquess
for Edith. Who'd have thought it?

10:52.100 --> 10:54.330
She hasn't accepted him
so he's not obligated.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.850
He wouldn't be coming here
if he'd changed his mind.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.450
If anyone had told me Mary
would hitch up with a mechanic

10:59.500 --> 11:02.010
and Edith would marry one of
the grandest men in England,

11:02.060 --> 11:03.490
I'd have knocked them down.

11:03.540 --> 11:08.970
- Mary has got rid of her mechanic and
Edith is not married yet. - I know.

11:09.020 --> 11:12.810
But for poor old Edith who couldn't
make her dolls do what she wanted,

11:12.860 --> 11:15.650
- it is rather wonderful.
- There's still Marigold.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.860
She hasn't told him yet and she must if
they're to have any chance of happiness.

11:21.820 --> 11:23.250
I beg you, my darling,

11:23.300 --> 11:27.410
please don't let things be spoiled
for her this time. That's all I ask.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.660
All?

11:30.180 --> 11:32.180
(CHUCKLES)

11:43.540 --> 11:47.220
I think the wood is right the way
it is. We don't need it any larger.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.930
Mary, let me get him up here.

11:56.980 --> 12:00.530
- There's no point. Nothing's changed.
- You've changed.

12:00.580 --> 12:05.730
It's not as easy as that. I find him
very attractive. I like him a lot.

12:05.780 --> 12:09.730
'I find him very attractive. I like
him a lot.' What a load of baloney!

12:09.780 --> 12:13.770
If I'm in love with him, then what's
that? A powerful urge that fades.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.810
Did it fade for you and Matthew?

12:15.860 --> 12:20.210
- We weren't married long enough but
I'm sure it would have done. - I'm not.

12:20.260 --> 12:24.930
Tom, look I don't mean to pull
rank but with people like us,

12:24.980 --> 12:26.570
we need to marry sensibly.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.010
Especially if we're going
to inherit the family show.

12:30.060 --> 12:32.370
It's a way of life that isn't for everyone

12:32.420 --> 12:34.250
and a bad marriage can poison it.

12:34.300 --> 12:39.690
- He's not an orangutan. He knows how it works.
- He wants different things.

12:39.740 --> 12:42.410
What about you and Matthew?
You came from different poles.

12:42.460 --> 12:48.090
- Yes, but we were young and free.
It's difficult the second time. - Why?

12:48.140 --> 12:51.410
Because you know what's at stake.
It's easier to get it wrong.

12:51.460 --> 12:54.650
- I only see a real opportunity for
you to get it right. - Honestly?

12:54.700 --> 12:58.930
- I'm always honest. - Are you? - Why
would you say that for heaven's sake?

12:58.980 --> 13:01.820
One word: Marigold.

13:02.860 --> 13:05.410
It wasn't my secret to tell.

13:05.460 --> 13:10.210
So, it is true. Well, I knew it was.

13:10.260 --> 13:13.490
Never mind Marigold. She won't
make you happy. Henry Talbot will.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.570
Oh, Henry Talbot, Henry Talbot.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.850
You're far more on his
side than you were on mine.

13:17.900 --> 13:21.010
He's the one for you. Trust
me and give him a chance.

13:21.060 --> 13:24.770
No. And if you want to redeem
yourself in my good graces,

13:24.820 --> 13:26.810
you won't give him a chance either.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.860
(SIGHS)

13:30.580 --> 13:32.570
Where is everybody?

13:32.620 --> 13:36.860
Mary and Tom are agenting and
Edith's gone to meet Bertie's train.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.810
Are we going to talk about it?

13:41.860 --> 13:47.090
Are we going to sit by and let
this young man's family and future

13:47.140 --> 13:50.090
be put at risk from a scandal
we are hiding from him?

13:50.140 --> 13:52.530
I don't think she has to
tell everybody but I agree.

13:52.580 --> 13:55.890
- She must tell him. Then it's his choice.
- Isn't it up to Edith?

13:55.940 --> 13:58.370
You say that because after
Tony Gillingham had gone,

13:58.420 --> 14:01.370
you thought none of your daughters
would make a worthy marriage.

14:01.420 --> 14:04.250
Now there's a chance and you can't
bring yourself to give it up.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.370
- You haven't got children. You
don't understand these things. - No.

14:07.420 --> 14:10.010
I haven't had children, as
you so kindly remind me,

14:10.060 --> 14:12.650
but I hope I do have a sense of decency.

14:12.700 --> 14:16.170
How long are you planning to stay?
Your cold must have cleared by now.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.540
Don't fight. Nothing's going to
get better by you two falling out.

14:21.540 --> 14:24.090
Hello, Mr Pelham. I mean...

14:24.140 --> 14:26.970
I'm going to stay Mr
Pelham until the service.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.410
I wish you'd call me Bertie.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.890
- What sort of service will it be?
- Not a funeral.

14:30.940 --> 14:33.050
I've decided not to disturb him.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.650
I'll fetch his things and settle his debts

14:35.700 --> 14:38.170
and have a service at home to say goodbye.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.330
That sounds like a very good plan.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.930
- I hope you'll allow me to come.
- I want you to come.

14:43.980 --> 14:48.090
- You remember my sister?
- Of course. Lady Rosamund.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.810
This must be a strange and
unsettling time for you.

14:50.860 --> 14:55.250
I'll say. My mother's cock-a-hoop,
but she doesn't appreciate

14:55.300 --> 14:57.970
- that I was devoted to Cousin Peter.
- I'm sure she does.

14:58.020 --> 15:01.930
Not really. Most people
didn't get the point of him.

15:01.980 --> 15:05.450
He was... so delicate.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.170
But he was as kind to me
as any man has ever been.

15:09.220 --> 15:12.340
Then how pleased he'd be to
know that you're his heir.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.250
(VOICE CRACKS) That's so nice of you.

15:18.620 --> 15:22.090
Goodness. I'm afraid you've made me blub.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.940
Let me take you upstairs to unpack.
Luncheon's not for half an hour.

15:33.180 --> 15:37.980
- And that's the man you want to trick
into marriage? - I'm going for a walk.

15:39.980 --> 15:44.850
I agree. But Robert thinks Edith's
had so little luck in her life.

15:44.900 --> 15:49.220
Oh, I sympathise, of course, but
we both know she's making a mistake.

15:57.460 --> 16:02.450
One thing. Don't forget Mr Pelham
is now the Marquess of Hexham,

16:02.500 --> 16:04.090
when you address him.

16:04.140 --> 16:06.890
I helped him unpack and he
wishes to remain Mr Pelham

16:06.940 --> 16:08.890
until his cousin's funeral, Mr Carson.

16:08.940 --> 16:12.050
He can call himself Mr
Pelham to his heart's content

16:12.100 --> 16:14.650
but he is Lord Hexham
nevertheless, Mr Bates,

16:14.700 --> 16:19.420
and we will refer to him as His
Lordship. Good. Time to get started.

16:21.100 --> 16:25.300
- Good news?
- (SIGHS) Not exactly.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.370
(READS) Thank you for your enquiry
but we wish to combine the roles

16:32.420 --> 16:36.890
of butler, chauffeur and valet,
and you seem overqualified.

16:36.940 --> 16:40.240
But please accept our
best wishes for the future.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.930
- What future?
- Don't be silly.

16:43.980 --> 16:48.650
Of course. That's right. I'm
silly, aren't I? Silly old me.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.820
- No wait.
- Let him go.

16:54.380 --> 16:58.730
What was it about Tangiers that
your cousin enjoyed so much?

16:58.780 --> 17:01.290
Who knows? He used to talk
of going down to the beach

17:01.340 --> 17:04.210
and watching the young
fishermen bring in the nets.

17:04.260 --> 17:07.130
How the setting sun would
make the scene magical

17:07.180 --> 17:09.930
until everything was suddenly
plunged into darkness.

17:09.980 --> 17:15.089
- Goodness. How lyrical.
- He was lyrical. He was an artist.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.530
In his heart, anyway.

17:16.579 --> 17:19.730
I don't think this family can
boast much in the way of artists.

17:19.780 --> 17:23.780
Although we did have an aunt
who was quite good at macrame.

17:23.980 --> 17:28.180
So, are you here to settle things
with Edith before you leave?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.050
Mary, please.

17:30.100 --> 17:36.140
I hope so. I hope we can get things
settled but I mustn't jump the gun.

17:39.700 --> 17:43.010
You've talked of your mother but
what other family do you have?

17:43.060 --> 17:47.370
That's it. My father's dead,
obviously, there are no siblings.

17:47.420 --> 17:49.570
It's just me and Mother.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.930
You were joking when you
said she was cock-a-hoop

17:51.980 --> 17:53.850
but she must feel a certain pride.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.850
I wasn't joking but judge for
yourselves when you meet her.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.410
You talk as if we should be scared.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.810
She makes Mr Squeers look
like Florence Nightingale.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.340
(CORA GIGGLES)

18:11.580 --> 18:14.140
Ladies? Can I have a picture?

18:14.300 --> 18:16.300
No, you may not.

18:20.660 --> 18:22.530
He's been there all day.

18:22.580 --> 18:26.010
Well, why didn't you telephone
and warn us? You daft ha'porth!

18:26.060 --> 18:28.530
I'm sorry, Auntie Beryl, I
thought you might not come

18:28.580 --> 18:30.890
and I'm going nearly mad here.

18:30.940 --> 18:36.650
- What about the bookings?
- Cancelled. - What?! All of them?

18:36.700 --> 18:39.410
One man wanted compensation.
For the ridicule.

18:39.460 --> 18:43.210
I hope you told him what he could
do with it! I'll give him RIDICULE!

18:43.260 --> 18:48.220
Now, calm down. There's no harm
done so let's go and have some tea.

18:55.660 --> 18:57.890
This is Mr Molesley.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.650
He will be teaching you history
and English literature.

19:00.700 --> 19:04.010
- Make him welcome, please.
- Good afternoon.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.740
Well, I'll leave you to it.

19:12.700 --> 19:18.940
This term we will explore the years
between the Civil War of 1642 and...

19:21.900 --> 19:27.210
1642 and the Glorious Revolution...

19:27.260 --> 19:29.260
of 1688.

19:29.980 --> 19:34.570
Almost half a century of
change and social progress.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.850
I hope you will find
it as exciting as I do.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.660
(YAWNS)

19:41.780 --> 19:44.370
Things have changed for you now.

19:44.420 --> 19:50.250
- You must know that you're quite
free if you want to be. - I don't.

19:50.300 --> 19:54.170
Look, of course things have changed.
I was in line for a quiet life,

19:54.220 --> 19:57.570
farming, sport, bringing
up a family with my wife.

19:57.620 --> 20:00.130
But now I'm to be one of
the kings of the county --

20:00.180 --> 20:03.610
always on parade, representing
the people who look up to me,

20:03.660 --> 20:07.850
fighting for causes, trying oh
so hard not to be disappointing.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.170
Oh, I think you'll make
a very good job of it.

20:10.220 --> 20:13.690
You couldn't ask for a man with
a sounder moral conscience.

20:13.740 --> 20:18.930
The conscience maybe, but what
about the courage? Help me. Please.

20:18.980 --> 20:22.290
But can I help? Am I worthy?

20:22.340 --> 20:26.570
The 7th Marquess of Hexham weds the
daughter of the 5th Earl of Grantham?

20:26.620 --> 20:30.220
What could be more suitable?
Mother will be thrilled.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.010
You talk of her a lot.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.530
She has been an important
figure in my life. I admit it.

20:36.580 --> 20:41.250
- But I don't agree with her about everything.
- Is she very stern?

20:41.300 --> 20:47.260
She certainly believes rank carries
responsibilities. But so do I.

20:48.180 --> 20:53.060
That's why I need you. To help
me live up to my own expectations.

20:56.180 --> 20:58.490
We ought to go in.

20:58.540 --> 21:01.780
Tea will have started and the
children will be down in a minute.

21:17.260 --> 21:21.730
- The husband has been bought off?
- Well, he's settled out of court.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.210
- And you won't have to be a witness?
- So Mr Willis said.

21:24.260 --> 21:29.770
But I've still lost every one of
my bookings. I'm a laughing stock.

21:29.820 --> 21:33.130
- I did wonder about the whole idea
from the beginning. - You did not!

21:33.180 --> 21:35.170
It's exactly what we're planning to do.

21:35.220 --> 21:37.810
Then clearly we're going to
have to be a lot more careful

21:37.860 --> 21:41.210
- than Mrs Patmore, aren't we?
- That's the front door, Mr Carson.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.330
(CLEARS THROAT) I'll go.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.290
Punch is terribly fierce.

21:49.340 --> 21:52.290
I don't think he's a good model
for marriage in later life.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.610
Or relations with the law.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.010
- Take that! And that! And that!
- Ouch, you rascal!

21:57.060 --> 22:00.140
- And that's the way to do it!
- Very good!

22:01.540 --> 22:03.690
Er, Mr Talbot.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.690
Hello, Mr Talbot. Mary never
told me you were coming.

22:06.740 --> 22:10.330
- I didn't know he was. - Well, the
thing is, I was driving down from Durham

22:10.380 --> 22:12.650
and I suddenly realised
I'd be passing the gates.

22:12.700 --> 22:16.850
- What were you doing in Durham?
- Oh, I was doing various car things.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.610
We haven't seen you since
that awful day at Brooklands.

22:19.660 --> 22:22.770
- I hope you're coping with it all.
- Well, one doesn't have much choice.

22:22.820 --> 22:26.810
- Did you know about this? - I might
have said if he was coming from Durham,

22:26.860 --> 22:28.410
then he'd be driving quite close.

22:28.460 --> 22:31.210
Don't think I'm amused. I
dislike my hand being forced.

22:31.260 --> 22:33.210
No-one's forcing anything.

22:33.260 --> 22:37.330
- Now you're here, I hope you'll
stay the night at least. - Mary?

22:37.380 --> 22:42.410
- Perhaps Mr Talbot is in a hurry
to get home. - No, no I'm not.

22:42.460 --> 22:46.330
It's settled then. Carson, will
you please tell Mrs Hughes?

22:46.380 --> 22:49.180
And ask someone to unpack for Mr Talbot.

22:50.300 --> 22:55.500
- I'm afraid you've missed tea. - Oh,
don't worry about that. - I won't.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.330
Hello, Bertie, I heard about your
cousin. I'm so terribly sorry.

23:04.380 --> 23:07.170
Thank you. I'm on my way out there now,

23:07.220 --> 23:09.370
but I wanted to get things
settled before I go.

23:09.420 --> 23:14.210
- And are they... settled?
- I think so. They will be.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.010
Then I envy you.

23:16.060 --> 23:19.820
I would say Mr Talbot has just
miscalculated rather badly.

23:23.220 --> 23:28.210
- .. the struggle between the Monarchy
and Parliament. - (SCHOOL BELL)

23:28.260 --> 23:30.850
Oh, right. That's it for today.

23:30.900 --> 23:35.850
Oh yes, er some of you may like
to examine these time charts

23:35.900 --> 23:39.500
that I've drawn up, tomorrow we'll
really begin to make a start.

23:40.700 --> 23:42.300
Would you...?

23:42.940 --> 23:45.130
This is so precisely not
the way to win me over!

23:45.180 --> 23:48.530
- Will you just get off your high horse?
- Why are you interfering?

23:48.580 --> 23:52.410
- I love you and want you to be happy. - Well,
you've got a bloody odd way of showing it!

23:52.460 --> 23:55.250
Well, I take it this is
me you're fighting about?

23:55.300 --> 23:59.410
Yes, it is. And you can dig yourself
out. Because I've had enough.

23:59.460 --> 24:01.020
Oh!

24:03.460 --> 24:05.730
- Have you brought a
dinner jacket? - Yes.

24:05.780 --> 24:08.930
Well, you were very well equipped
to do your 'car things' in Durham.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.370
How many years do you think
it's taken to find someone

24:11.420 --> 24:13.250
I want to spend the rest of my life with?

24:13.300 --> 24:16.970
Living in my family house?
Working to preserve my estate

24:17.020 --> 24:20.250
- and being outranked by your own stepson?
- Oh, I'm tougher than I look.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.250
Oh, Henry, please don't make
this harder than it has to be.

24:23.300 --> 24:27.810
(HALF LAUGHS) Are you mad? If
you're trying to get rid of me,

24:27.860 --> 24:34.130
I'm going to make this as
hard and as horrible as I can!

24:34.180 --> 24:37.660
Well you're being extremely unfair!

24:47.620 --> 24:51.490
I wish I knew what we should do.
(I'm tempted to tell him myself.)

24:51.540 --> 24:54.690
You think he's strong enough
to stand out against his mother?

24:54.740 --> 24:58.650
Can't we just leave Edith to
tell him or not, as she sees fit?

24:58.700 --> 25:00.570
Tell him what?

25:00.620 --> 25:04.450
That Mr Gregson made Edith his heir.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.890
Some men might not feel
comfortable with that.

25:06.940 --> 25:12.090
Why did you invite Henry to
stay, without asking me first?

25:12.140 --> 25:15.410
Darling, it was half-past five and
the man was in North Yorkshire.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.890
What did you want him to do?
Pitch a tent under a tree?

25:17.940 --> 25:20.050
He must have made a plan
for his journey back.

25:20.100 --> 25:25.370
I doubt he ever went to Durham.
He came up here to see you.

25:25.420 --> 25:28.330
- Who says so?
- The look in his eyes.

25:28.380 --> 25:31.690
Not one of you thinks it's a
good idea! A professional driver?

25:31.740 --> 25:34.850
- With nothing to his name?
- Then give him up. - I had.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.890
I did. Until Mama invited
him to make himself at home!

25:37.940 --> 25:43.090
You can't expect us to be rude. The
man's only crime is to love you.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.900
Just send him away! As quick
as you can. For all our sakes.

25:49.740 --> 25:53.650
She's right about one thing. None
of us thinks it's a good idea.

25:53.700 --> 25:57.980
Maybe not. But she's clearly quite
mad about him, whatever she says.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.400
How was it, Mr Molesley? Teaching?

26:04.500 --> 26:05.700
Oh.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.290
It...

26:08.340 --> 26:12.770
- it was, quite a challenge.
- There's always another day.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.300
I know.

26:16.100 --> 26:20.260
They've got their coffee upstairs
so I'll make a last check.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.690
How are you getting to Tangiers?
Is there a boat that sails direct?

26:26.740 --> 26:29.610
- Actually I'm flying. For
the first bit, anyway. - What?

26:29.660 --> 26:33.530
- I know. It does seem rather daring.
- I do not envy you.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.610
I don't know. Now the commercial
airlines are starting to operate,

26:36.660 --> 26:39.650
I dare say we'll all be flying
hither and thither before too long.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.770
(SCOFFS) I rather doubt that.

26:41.820 --> 26:45.810
I like the way Bertie makes no bones
about it. He's here to see you.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.010
I know.

26:47.060 --> 26:49.970
The same could be said of me but
I'm not doing as well as he is.

26:50.020 --> 26:53.530
I hope you know what you are doing.
She's quite a handful you know.

26:53.580 --> 26:58.170
- Who's a handful? - My beloved sister.
- Well, she is beloved by me, anyway.

26:58.220 --> 27:03.290
- I like Bertie. I do. But when you
see them together... - Meaning?

27:03.340 --> 27:05.010
If Henry were the new Marquess,

27:05.060 --> 27:07.770
there wouldn't be a woman who
wasn't setting her cap at him.

27:07.820 --> 27:10.050
What about you? Would
you set your cap at him?

27:10.100 --> 27:15.380
- Because if that's why you're not,
shame on you. - Oh, stop lecturing me!

27:16.740 --> 27:18.580
Excuse me.

27:22.460 --> 27:25.860
Mary, wait. Wait!

27:26.340 --> 27:29.090
Look, I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.970
I thought I could present my
arguments effectively in person,

27:32.020 --> 27:35.570
- clearly I was wrong.
- I can't bear to be manoeuvred.

27:35.620 --> 27:39.650
But you see, I think we
love each other very much.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.800
For some reason, you're
fighting it. I'm not.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.210
My birth is respectable,
so it can't be that,

27:47.260 --> 27:50.330
which forces me to believe
that it is my lack of money

27:50.380 --> 27:53.210
and position that present the problem.

27:53.260 --> 27:56.610
- Aren't you better than that?
- What?

27:56.660 --> 27:59.970
Well, it just seems rather small to me.

28:00.020 --> 28:01.650
Not to marry a man for lack of money

28:01.700 --> 28:05.130
- is the same as marrying him because of
it. - Out of my way! - Am I not right?

28:05.180 --> 28:07.970
No. You push in here,
into my home, uninvited,

28:08.020 --> 28:11.930
in order to call me a grubby, little
gold digger? You've got a nerve!

28:11.980 --> 28:13.300
Mary!

28:16.260 --> 28:17.660
Mary!

28:26.700 --> 28:29.170
She loves him but she can't control him.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.930
That's what frightens her. He's
stronger than she is, really.

28:32.980 --> 28:36.570
Or as strong. And she's not used to it.

28:36.620 --> 28:40.220
She's a bit of a bully, your
Lady Mary. She likes her own way.

28:41.140 --> 28:46.770
She is and she does but there's
another side to her. He sees that.

28:46.820 --> 28:50.020
- So you were wrong about him?
- I think I was.

28:53.100 --> 28:58.100
- Why are you smiling? - Show me a man that
doesn't smile when his wife admits she's wrong.

29:09.660 --> 29:14.050
- Won't you send me to bed happy?
- Sounds like an indecent proposal.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.770
(BOTH LAUGH)

29:15.820 --> 29:18.650
I meant, give me your answer.

29:18.700 --> 29:24.540
Let me go to Tangiers with a sense
my tomorrows are beginning. Please.

29:26.980 --> 29:31.450
I love you, Bertie.
I've been in love before.

29:31.500 --> 29:35.210
I won't pretend that I haven't.
But I really do love you.

29:35.260 --> 29:38.410
Then I'll take that as a yes.

29:38.460 --> 29:43.810
The trouble is, I'm not
as simple as I used to be.

29:43.860 --> 29:46.000
My life is not as simple.

29:49.820 --> 29:54.170
I... just need to be
sure I'm being realistic,

29:54.220 --> 29:59.330
not living in a fool's paradise
and dragging you into it with me.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.650
I'll still take it as a yes.

30:16.060 --> 30:20.850
- You're down early. - No, I'm
not. Where's Henry? - He's gone.

30:20.900 --> 30:24.820
- What? - He had something in London
this evening and wanted to get back.

30:35.180 --> 30:37.820
I have a mass of letters to write.

30:45.660 --> 30:49.050
- I'm sorry Lord Grantham's left.
- Why particularly?

30:49.100 --> 30:54.060
Because we've got some news and I
was waiting for Mary to join us.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.440
It's not the right moment.

30:57.100 --> 31:00.580
Carson, could we have
some more coffee, please?

31:07.700 --> 31:09.850
Why isn't it the right moment?

31:09.900 --> 31:14.690
- Well, Henry's abandoned you.
- No, he hasn't. I wanted him to go.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.370
- That's not what it looked like.
- Well, that's how it is.

31:17.420 --> 31:19.490
There's no need for this.

31:19.540 --> 31:22.810
Edith, if your news is good, then
we are very happy for you both.

31:22.860 --> 31:25.260
Aren't we, Mary?

31:26.300 --> 31:28.770
See? I told you.

31:28.820 --> 31:32.410
The one thing Mary can't bear
is when things are going better

31:32.460 --> 31:35.130
- for me than for her.
- I'm sure that's not true.

31:35.180 --> 31:38.650
You don't know her. I'm getting
married and you've lost your man.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.690
And you just can't stand it.

31:40.740 --> 31:44.490
- Edith, there is no need for --
- You're wrong. I'm very happy for you.

31:44.540 --> 31:49.090
And I admire you, Bertie. Not
everyone would accept Edith's past.

31:49.140 --> 31:53.130
- Mary, don't. - What do you mean?
- Well, you must've told him?

31:53.180 --> 31:55.530
You couldn't accept him
without telling him?

31:55.580 --> 31:59.260
- Tell me what?
- About Marigold. Who she really is.

32:04.780 --> 32:07.420
Marigold is my daughter.

32:20.540 --> 32:22.540
Will you excuse me?

32:38.460 --> 32:41.730
I beg your pardon, Your
Ladyship, but Mr Pelham, that is,

32:41.780 --> 32:44.890
Lord Hexham, has asked for a
taxi and Mr Carson has gone out,

32:44.940 --> 32:48.050
- so I'm not quite sure --
- What? Lord Hexham's leaving?

32:48.100 --> 32:50.330
Obviously, if he wants a
taxi. What's happened?

32:50.380 --> 32:53.010
Where's Lady Edith? Can't she
drive him to the station?

32:53.060 --> 32:57.890
- Don't bother about it, Mrs Hughes.
I'll sort it out. - Very good, M'Lord.

32:57.940 --> 33:01.540
- Mrs Hughes, how is Mrs Patmore?
- She's still very upset, M'Lady.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.370
But there's nothing to be done.

33:04.420 --> 33:07.730
- Is this about her B & B going
down the drain? - Don't be flippant.

33:07.780 --> 33:11.210
Why don't we pay her a visit? Have
tea there and let people see us.

33:11.260 --> 33:14.130
What a good idea! Why
didn't I think of that?

33:14.180 --> 33:16.890
But if it's to be effective, won't
we have to be in the papers?

33:16.940 --> 33:20.330
Well, the local papers. And it
wouldn't be a news story any more

33:20.380 --> 33:23.650
- than being photographed at a flower show.
- Would Mrs Patmore agree?

33:23.700 --> 33:28.500
- I think she'd be bowled over, Your Ladyship.
- Then it's settled.

33:29.820 --> 33:32.970
I hope you don't mind my saying
that you seem very suspicious.

33:33.020 --> 33:37.650
Do I? But you must admit, your
attitude is quite a volte-face.

33:37.700 --> 33:41.730
I want Larry's father to be
content. Is that a volte-face?

33:41.780 --> 33:47.250
But does your fiance want his Papa
to be content in this way? With me?

33:47.300 --> 33:49.450
Well, you know men.

33:49.500 --> 33:53.410
I'm not sure I do, as it
happens. Tell me about them.

33:53.460 --> 33:58.410
I only meant they dig
themselves into a position,

33:58.460 --> 34:00.850
often before considering all the options.

34:00.900 --> 34:04.890
- And you've considered 'the options'?
- I believe so.

34:04.940 --> 34:06.650
Here's another option for you.

34:06.700 --> 34:12.010
I won't rekindle Lord Merton's
dreams unless I'm invited to do so

34:12.060 --> 34:15.409
by Larry Grey, himself. Is that clear?

34:15.460 --> 34:18.130
I speak for him.

34:18.179 --> 34:21.810
Yes, but you see, I don't
want you to speak FOR him.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.530
I want to hear him speak for himself.

34:25.820 --> 34:31.210
Oh, I see. The plan is to mix up His
Lordship or, worse, Her Ladyship,

34:31.260 --> 34:34.650
with a divorce petition and
the scene of an adultery?

34:34.699 --> 34:38.449
But I want to bury that story and I
need a big event to bury it under.

34:38.500 --> 34:43.010
You have no qualms about dragging
the family we serve into the mud?

34:43.060 --> 34:47.730
It's their choice, Mr Carson.
They're all grown people, surely?

34:47.780 --> 34:50.889
Well, I've always known
that women were ruthless,

34:50.940 --> 34:54.460
but I didn't think I'd find
the proof in my own wife!

34:58.620 --> 35:01.810
And there's me thinking how kind
they were to come to the rescue.

35:01.860 --> 35:05.220
And so they are. Just tell
them yes and arrange the day.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.890
- He'll miss his train.
- Let him miss it.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.690
He can catch the next one. What happened?

35:13.740 --> 35:16.370
Mary thought Edith had
told him about Marigold.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.810
- How did Mary find out?
- Mary is not stupid.

35:18.860 --> 35:23.610
No. And she's not always kind,
either. Was it really a mistake?

35:23.660 --> 35:26.050
What difference does it make?

35:26.100 --> 35:29.530
I'm not shocked exactly. It
isn't that. I promise you.

35:29.580 --> 35:32.530
You have to protect the honour
of your family. Of course you do.

35:32.580 --> 35:34.580
It isn't even that.

35:36.020 --> 35:39.810
You should have told me the
whole story from the beginning.

35:39.860 --> 35:45.010
- You haven't been fair to me.
- No. I don't believe I have.

35:45.060 --> 35:51.340
- Then why didn't you?
- I suppose I thought it might ruin everything.

35:52.180 --> 35:57.220
- You mean you didn't trust me?
- I can't have, can I?

36:02.780 --> 36:05.050
Would you have married me in a lie?

36:05.100 --> 36:10.690
I don't think so, but
we'll never know now.

36:10.740 --> 36:12.420
No.

36:15.780 --> 36:20.260
You see, I don't feel I could spend
my life with someone I don't trust.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.900
- Who didn't trust me.
Do you understand? - Yes.

36:27.220 --> 36:32.660
I'm terribly sorry, of course, but
that doesn't mean much, does it?

36:34.300 --> 36:37.890
The truth is, my life was
about to be perfectly wonderful

36:37.940 --> 36:42.460
and now I've thrown it all away.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.810
(SIGHS)

36:48.860 --> 36:55.530
- I'd better go if I'm to
catch my train. - Yes, hurry.

36:55.580 --> 36:59.410
I doubt we'll meet again
so I want to say good luck,

36:59.460 --> 37:01.850
and everything else that goes with it.

37:01.900 --> 37:04.420
Good luck to you, too.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.300
I mean that.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.460
(RAPID FOOTFALL)

37:35.580 --> 37:38.610
Well, you got what you wanted!
Bertie has left for the train

37:38.660 --> 37:41.090
and Edith won't be the
next Marchioness of Hexham!

37:41.140 --> 37:44.850
- Well, that's not what I wanted.
- Isn't it?

37:44.900 --> 37:48.170
I still can't believe she'd never
told him. How was I to know that?

37:48.220 --> 37:51.170
- Don't play the innocent with me.
- I didn't mean it.

37:51.220 --> 37:55.530
Don't lie! Not to me! You
can't stop ruining things!

37:55.580 --> 37:59.450
For Edith, for yourself! You'd
pull in the sky if you could!

37:59.500 --> 38:02.290
ANYTHING to make you feel
less frightened and alone!

38:02.340 --> 38:06.570
You saw Henry when he was here --
high-handed, bullying, unapologetic.

38:06.620 --> 38:09.130
Am I expected to lower myself to his level

38:09.180 --> 38:12.090
and be grateful I'm allowed to do so?

38:12.140 --> 38:14.610
Listen to yourself. 'Lower
yourself to his level'.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.850
You're not a princess in
The Prisoner of Zenda!

38:16.900 --> 38:20.170
- You don't want to understand me.
- You ruined Edith's life today!

38:20.220 --> 38:23.770
How many lives are you going to
wreck just to smother your misery?

38:23.820 --> 38:27.220
- I REFUSE to listen!
- You're a coward, Mary.

38:28.060 --> 38:30.780
Like all bullies, you're a coward.

38:40.460 --> 38:42.450
What are you doing up here?

38:42.500 --> 38:45.450
Looking for you to borrow some
scissors but you're going out.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.570
I've left my workbox downstairs
but you're welcome to take them.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.290
Where are you off to?

38:50.340 --> 38:54.900
I said I'd walk with Mr Molesley to
the schoolhouse. For moral support.

38:58.100 --> 39:02.140
- Are you all right, Mr Barrow?
- Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

39:30.820 --> 39:33.160
(EDITH SNIFFS INSIDE HER ROOM)

39:36.700 --> 39:38.970
- Going away?
- Do you care?

39:41.140 --> 39:45.450
Look, I wasn't to know you hadn't
told him. It never occurred to me --

39:45.500 --> 39:49.090
Just shut up! I don't
know what's happened.

39:49.140 --> 39:51.730
Tom has made you feel bad, or Papa,

39:51.780 --> 39:56.050
or maybe it's just the same old
Mary who wants her cake and ha'penny!

39:56.100 --> 39:58.810
- I never meant to --
- Yes, you did!

39:58.860 --> 40:03.370
Who do you think you're
talking to? Mama? Your maid?

40:03.420 --> 40:04.970
I know you!

40:05.020 --> 40:08.850
I know you to be a nasty,
jealous, scheming bitch!

40:08.900 --> 40:12.000
- Now listen, you pathetic --
- You're a bitch!

40:12.300 --> 40:16.690
Not content with ruining your own
life, you're determined to ruin mine!

40:16.740 --> 40:21.650
I have not ruined my life and if
Bertie's put off by that, then --

40:21.700 --> 40:25.620
Don't demean yourself by trying
to justify your venom. Just go.

40:27.780 --> 40:29.940
(SCOFFS)

40:35.980 --> 40:41.170
And you're wrong as you so often
are. Henry's perfect for you.

40:41.220 --> 40:43.570
You're just too stupid
and stuck up to see it!

40:43.620 --> 40:46.250
Still at least he's got away from you.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.600
Which is something to
give thanks for, I suppose!

40:54.500 --> 40:57.730
I beg your pardon, M'Lord but Mrs
Patmore has something to say.

40:57.780 --> 41:01.100
- I wonder if now would be convenient.
- Of course. Bring her in.

41:05.780 --> 41:09.810
- How can we help, Mrs Patmore?
- Well, that's just it, M'Lord.

41:09.860 --> 41:13.450
I know you're planning to help
by coming over to the cottage

41:13.500 --> 41:16.930
for some tea but should
you be mixed up in it?

41:16.980 --> 41:20.970
- It's my mess, why should
you pay for it? - Indeed.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.210
- Carson? Is this what you believe?
- It is, Your Ladyship.

41:25.260 --> 41:29.860
I wouldn't like to see this family
dragged into a tawdry, local brouhaha.

41:30.660 --> 41:31.890
He means me.

41:31.940 --> 41:36.930
- Oh, I think we have to show a little
more backbone than that. - My Lord?

41:36.980 --> 41:40.570
Mrs Patmore has been loyal to this house
and this house must be loyal to her.

41:40.620 --> 41:43.530
She had made a large
investment in her future.

41:43.580 --> 41:45.530
We can't let it fall away to nothing.

41:45.580 --> 41:47.580
(CHOKES BACK TEARS)

41:49.340 --> 41:53.540
- I'll go now, if I may.
- We'll see you on Friday.

41:58.180 --> 42:01.780
- Are you sure, My Lord?
- QUITE sure, thank you, Carson.

42:05.860 --> 42:07.730
You mustn't be nervous.

42:07.780 --> 42:11.370
You don't know what they're like.
I felt like a fraud yesterday.

42:11.420 --> 42:14.290
And all the time I kept
wondering, "What would they say

42:14.340 --> 42:17.210
if they found out that I was
a servant at the big house?"

42:17.260 --> 42:19.570
What would their parents say?

42:19.620 --> 42:23.140
Why not tell them? Then they won't
have to find out, will they?

42:25.820 --> 42:29.420
- Mr Barrow's in a funny mood.
- Why?

42:30.740 --> 42:34.210
He suddenly told me out of the blue
he hoped I'd make more of my life

42:34.260 --> 42:36.460
than he'd ever make of his.

42:39.660 --> 42:44.820
- I should go back. - Is
something wrong? - I hope not.

43:05.420 --> 43:07.410
- You're on the men's side!
- Never mind that.

43:07.460 --> 43:10.170
- Have you seen Mr Barrow?
- Er, he was going in for a bath.

43:10.220 --> 43:13.060
Oh, my God! Come with me!

Hello! (BANGS ON DOOR) Mr
Barrow! Are you in there?

43:17.940 --> 43:20.530
- (LOCKED DOOR RATTLES)
- Will you open this door?

43:20.580 --> 43:22.460
Get back!

43:25.740 --> 43:27.730
- Oh, my God!
- Fetch Mrs Hughes.

43:27.780 --> 43:30.860
Send Anna for the doctor but tell
no-one else what you've seen.

43:32.980 --> 43:36.690
- I wish I'd gone with them now.
- With who?

43:36.740 --> 43:40.130
- Mr Molesley and Miss Baxter.
- Well, go then.

43:40.180 --> 43:42.370
- I can manage.
- I'll be too late, though, won't I?

43:42.420 --> 43:45.410
You should still go if
you want to. For a walk.

43:45.460 --> 43:48.460
They might have a break
when you get there.

43:51.780 --> 43:56.100
- Where's Mrs Hughes and Anna?
- Mrs Hughes is in her sitting room.

44:07.180 --> 44:09.180
(HOOTS)

44:14.060 --> 44:16.130
- Are you in a rush?
- Not particularly.

44:16.180 --> 44:18.490
- Why? - I need you to come
with me to the station.

44:18.540 --> 44:23.010
- Then you can drive the car home.
- Where are you going? - Up to London.

44:23.060 --> 44:26.850
I haven't said goodbye to anyone
and I can't bear to look at Mary.

44:26.900 --> 44:32.050
- She's unhappy. I think she regrets
what she did. - Not as much as I do.

44:32.100 --> 44:35.490
And, for your information,
before I left we had the row

44:35.540 --> 44:37.770
we all knew was coming.

44:37.820 --> 44:42.290
I'm not sorry. At least I'm just
sorry we didn't have it years ago.

44:42.340 --> 44:45.330
Bertie may come round.

44:45.380 --> 44:48.690
I don't think so. He might
have come round about Marigold.

44:48.740 --> 44:51.210
In fact, I'm sure he would've done.

44:51.260 --> 44:54.890
But I tried to trick him and
he won't come round about that.

44:54.940 --> 44:59.460
- Would you like me to talk to him?
- No, but I love you for asking.

45:00.860 --> 45:03.140
We should get going.

45:15.420 --> 45:17.420
(DOOR OPENS)

45:21.580 --> 45:23.650
Anna's gone for Doctor Clarkson.

45:23.700 --> 45:27.690
Now, we should get him into
bed and out of his wet things.

45:27.740 --> 45:29.810
I hope he won't mind if we undress him.

45:29.860 --> 45:33.610
He's past minding if we put him
in a shy and threw coconuts.

45:33.660 --> 45:36.960
Now you take his feet and
we'll take an arm each.

45:40.380 --> 45:43.410
- Should we tell His Lordship?
- Mr Carson's seeing to that.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.200
Right. Here goes.

45:46.500 --> 45:50.380
- I hate to think he was so unhappy.
- At least it's not gone too far.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.860
Why should you?

46:05.180 --> 46:07.180
(MR MOLESLEY CONTINUES)

46:09.900 --> 46:12.890
.. and maybe one of you will run
the country one day. How about that?

46:12.940 --> 46:15.570
That's daft, sir. Only
toffs run the country.

46:15.620 --> 46:19.690
No, you see, you must never
think that education is only

46:19.740 --> 46:24.490
for special people, you know,
for clever people, for toffs.

46:24.540 --> 46:26.930
- Education is for everyone.
- You would say that, sir.

46:26.980 --> 46:30.570
- Yes, I would. But I'm not anyone special.
- You're a teacher.

46:30.620 --> 46:34.290
I'm a teacher now. But
I'm an ordinary bloke.

46:34.340 --> 46:37.810
I've spent my life in
service, fetching and carrying.

46:37.860 --> 46:43.450
- You were a servant?
- I was. I am. And I was glad to get the work.

46:43.500 --> 46:47.690
My mum's in service. She works
for Mr Travis at the vicarage.

46:47.740 --> 46:50.450
Dad's a gardener at Skelton Park.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.530
But I never gave up on
learning, do you see?

46:52.580 --> 46:57.090
I read as much as I could
and I taught myself,

46:57.140 --> 47:00.490
and I hope to be able to teach you.

47:00.540 --> 47:04.140
Maybe give you the shortcut
that I never had...

47:08.940 --> 47:15.850
Right. The Civil War. Let's start
with the Divine Right of Kings.

47:15.900 --> 47:21.330
Did King Charles really believe
that he had a Divine Right to rule?

47:21.380 --> 47:24.450
Or did he just choose to believe
it because it suited him?

47:24.500 --> 47:29.210
- You mean the King was a liar?
- Er. Not quite.

47:29.260 --> 47:32.260
Kings are like anyone else.

47:34.300 --> 47:37.650
Anna says Edith's gone to London
and I suppose we all know why.

47:37.700 --> 47:40.530
- Do we have to do this now?
- Yes, I really think --

47:40.580 --> 47:43.690
Carson, what's happened?
Where are the footmen?

47:43.740 --> 47:47.010
That is something I need to
discuss with you, My Lord.

47:47.060 --> 47:49.060
(CARSON WHISPERS)

47:50.700 --> 47:52.690
Thomas has cut his wrists?

47:52.740 --> 47:57.890
- Yes, I'm afraid so, My Lord.
- God in Heaven. Who knows?

47:57.940 --> 48:00.290
Not many and I should
like to keep it that way.

48:00.340 --> 48:03.610
- I shall say that he is ill
with influenza. - Carson...

48:03.660 --> 48:07.660
- please don't bother with serving our tea.
- With your permission, My Lady.

48:14.620 --> 48:18.100
How sad. How very sad.

48:24.380 --> 48:28.020
Do you still think dismissing
Barrow was a useful saving, Papa?

48:30.500 --> 48:33.940
That's rather below the
belt, even for you.

48:40.480 --> 48:42.830
Look, we've kept him out of the hospital.

48:42.880 --> 48:46.950
Dr Clarkson stitched him up here. He
says Miss Baxter found him in time.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I'll go up in a minute.

48:54.160 --> 48:57.270
I saw Doctor Clarkson leaving when
I got back. What was he doing here?

48:57.320 --> 49:01.470
Mr Barrow has been taken poorly.
He will spend a day or two in bed.

49:01.520 --> 49:04.480
Anna and Miss Baxter will look after him.

49:05.680 --> 49:10.030
- How was it, Mr Molesley?
- Oh. I enjoyed myself today.

49:10.080 --> 49:13.390
- The children were generous to me.
- The children were spellbound.

49:13.440 --> 49:16.190
- How do you know?
- Because I crept in and listened.

49:16.240 --> 49:19.240
- You never.
- I did. And you're a natural.

49:22.320 --> 49:27.350
So, are we to lose you to the
groves of academe, Mr Molesley?

49:27.400 --> 49:31.030
Can I teach a little while longer
before I re-order my world, Mr Carson?

49:31.080 --> 49:34.310
I'm glad, though. You're
a kind man, Mr Molesley.

49:34.360 --> 49:37.860
It's about time you were
rewarded for your kindness.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.630
He'll recover, M'Lady. And he
hasn't had to go to hospital.

49:43.680 --> 49:47.080
- Can we keep it quiet? For his sake.
- That's what Mr Carson wants.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.710
What a day. I ruin Lady Edith's
life and Barrow tries to end his.

49:53.760 --> 49:57.150
- How is Lady Edith?
- She's gone to London.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.110
Which is hardly to be wondered at,

49:59.160 --> 50:03.190
when her only sister has wrecked her
chances of a happy, fulfilling life.

50:03.240 --> 50:09.600
- Lord Hexham won't come round?
- Lady Edith thinks not. And I'm sorry.

50:13.680 --> 50:18.150
What about you? Have you thought
any more about Mr Talbot?

50:18.200 --> 50:21.030
Don't you start. You're
as bad as Mr Branson.

50:21.080 --> 50:25.710
- Why? What's he done?
- He asked Mr Talbot to come here

50:25.760 --> 50:31.110
and he keeps going on and on and on.
But Mr Talbot's not right for me.

50:31.160 --> 50:36.160
- He's not. We'd be miserable. - As long
as you're sure that you -- - I am sure!

50:38.680 --> 50:40.310
I apologise.

50:40.360 --> 50:45.910
It's just nobody can believe
that I know my own mind.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.160
Of course, M'Lady.

50:50.680 --> 50:54.840
- Right. Can I do anything more for you?
- No, thank you.

51:03.040 --> 51:06.080
Good night. And Anna...

51:07.240 --> 51:09.160
.. I'm sorry.

51:20.480 --> 51:24.840
- You don't know that's the end.
- Yes, I do.

51:26.280 --> 51:28.880
And please don't think badly of him.

51:29.280 --> 51:34.950
- It was my own fault.
- Well, I liked him. - Me, too.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.920
Your sister hasn't been helpful.

51:39.560 --> 51:44.670
Mary and I are locked into a kind of
lifelong struggle and I don't know,

51:44.720 --> 51:47.710
it's hard for an outsider to
understand. It's hard for me.

51:47.760 --> 51:50.670
Who invented families?
That's what I'd like to know.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.990
- What time is Miss Jones coming today?
- Five. For tea.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.030
Do we know her real name yet?

51:56.080 --> 51:59.150
She only writes as Cassandra Jones
which is the name on her account.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.390
Perhaps it is her real name, after all.

52:01.440 --> 52:06.470
Well, real or not, she has quite a
following. So we'd better be pals.

52:06.520 --> 52:10.630
- How did you get her to come here?
- I'm afraid I forced her.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.910
Look, she wants more money
which is fair enough

52:12.960 --> 52:16.190
given the success of the column, but
I insisted we negotiate in person.

52:16.240 --> 52:19.670
- Why?
- I was curious. Aren't you?

52:19.720 --> 52:22.990
Suppose she sends someone
to impersonate her,

52:23.040 --> 52:25.030
if she's as secretive as all that?

52:25.080 --> 52:27.510
Let's have a sign if we think
it's the real Cassandra.

52:27.560 --> 52:31.310
Say, "Bananas" if you think
she's telling the truth.

52:31.360 --> 52:33.600
All right. Bananas it is.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.400
(KNOCK ON DOOR, DOOR OPENS)

52:42.400 --> 52:43.790
May we come in?

52:43.840 --> 52:49.790
Hello, Mr Barrow. Here you
are. To make you feel better.

52:49.840 --> 52:55.190
- Thank you very much, Master George.
- We want you to get better, Barrow.

52:55.240 --> 52:59.230
Truly. And no-one more than Master George.

52:59.280 --> 53:02.790
- At least I've got one friend, eh?
- Have you been lonely?

53:02.840 --> 53:07.950
If I have, I've only myself to
blame. I've done and said things.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.790
I don't know why, I can't stop
myself. Now I'm paying the price.

53:14.840 --> 53:18.070
Strange. I could say the same.

53:18.120 --> 53:22.750
- Mr Carson's told them that
you've got -- - 'Flu. I know.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.110
I beg your pardon, M'Lady.

53:25.160 --> 53:31.030
We're going Barrow and I hope
things improve for you. I really do.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.990
I'd say the same if it
weren't impertinent, M'Lady.

53:34.040 --> 53:37.800
- Goodbye, Mr Barrow.
- Goodbye, Master George.

53:42.160 --> 53:45.310
- So. Today's the big day.
- Oh, spare me.

53:45.360 --> 53:48.870
- Do you want to take Daisy with you?
- Oh, if I'm allowed.

53:48.920 --> 53:52.390
I mean my niece is good but
she might be dumbstruck

53:52.440 --> 53:54.950
with those Lords and Ladies
sitting in my front room.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.910
Come to think of it, how will the
village know that they've been?

53:57.960 --> 54:01.670
Lucy's seen to that. We've got the
man from The Echo coming at five.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.950
Oh? Put up a poster, why don't you?

54:04.000 --> 54:06.910
They're doing something nice,
Mr Carson. Don't spoil it.

54:06.960 --> 54:10.310
Yes. Very nice (!) For the public
to read about the cakes and dainties

54:10.360 --> 54:14.430
His Lordship is guzzling as he
sits at the adulterers' table!

54:14.480 --> 54:18.270
I'm sure there've been a few
adulterers sat at the table upstairs.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.470
- That is different.
- Why?

54:20.520 --> 54:25.670
To say nothing of suicidal footman
in the attic! What are we coming to?

54:25.720 --> 54:29.040
I only thank God that the Dowager
isn't here to witness it.

54:52.760 --> 54:55.590
- I can't believe you came.
- You made it sound so urgent.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.750
Even so, I really
appreciate it. Thank you.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.710
- Was everything all right when you got home?
- Well no, not really.

55:00.760 --> 55:03.990
- Spratt has gone away.
- Did you tell him you were coming back?

55:04.040 --> 55:06.630
A good butler should not need to be told.

55:06.680 --> 55:11.750
Now, where are they? My
broken-hearted granddaughters?

55:11.800 --> 55:15.030
It's just Mary. Edith's gone up to
London. I didn't know when I wrote.

55:15.080 --> 55:17.080
All the better.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.910
But how will we get it all there?

55:20.960 --> 55:25.390
They're letting me have a car. Seeing
as I'm giving tea to His Lordship.

55:25.440 --> 55:28.350
You're ready, then? They've
brought the car round.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.400
Andrew, carry that out.

55:33.440 --> 55:38.550
- And very, very good luck.
- And good luck to us all(!)

55:38.600 --> 55:41.670
In the vain hope that we'll
avoid scandalous gossip.

55:41.720 --> 55:45.670
- You're such an old curmudgeon.
- Don't say you're going off me.

55:45.720 --> 55:51.560
No, because you're MY curmudgeon
and that makes all the difference.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Hm.

55:58.840 --> 56:02.470
Granny. When did you arrive?

56:02.520 --> 56:06.390
Yesterday evening. I spent the
night before in Southampton

56:06.440 --> 56:10.710
and an entire day on trains.
So I've come hot foot.

56:10.760 --> 56:13.910
If you're here to reprimand
me about Edith, please don't.

56:13.960 --> 56:16.270
Tom's already torn me into strips.

56:16.320 --> 56:20.230
- Why did you do it?
- I don't know. She was so...

56:20.280 --> 56:23.230
- Anyway, I'm sorry now.
- You should be.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.630
With Edith, I just say things
and then they can't be unsaid.

56:26.680 --> 56:31.190
Tom believes you're unhappy.
That's why you lash out as you do.

56:31.240 --> 56:34.630
Look, if this is about Henry
Talbot, you should be clear

56:34.680 --> 56:39.830
he hasn't much to offer. Bertie
Hexham is a loss but not Henry.

56:39.880 --> 56:43.270
He's well born, but there's
no money or position.

56:43.320 --> 56:47.150
He's not even a countryman. Not
really. He grew up in London.

56:47.200 --> 56:51.430
- He shoots. - Yes, he shoots. Like
every social-climbing banker shoots.

56:51.480 --> 56:55.550
Well, let's leave his credentials
to one side for a moment

56:55.600 --> 56:59.230
- and concentrate on what
is important. - Which is?

56:59.280 --> 57:03.670
Tom says that he is in love with you
and that you are in love with him.

57:03.720 --> 57:07.120
- Do you believe him?
- Do you deny it?

57:09.160 --> 57:12.470
Oh, for you of all people to talk as
if his qualifications don't matter!

57:12.520 --> 57:18.840
Tony Gillingham had all that I could
wish -- birth, money, looks...

57:20.000 --> 57:22.670
- .. but he didn't suit you.
- No.

57:22.720 --> 57:26.510
He wasn't clever enough.
He wasn't strong enough.

57:26.560 --> 57:29.190
Henry Talbot is both.

57:29.240 --> 57:31.910
All right, Granny, it's not his poverty.

57:31.960 --> 57:36.590
But did Tom tell you, I stood
there staring at a car in flames,

57:36.640 --> 57:39.870
- wondering if it were him?
- I think he's told me everything.

57:39.920 --> 57:44.350
Then you'll know I can't be
a crash widow again. I can't!

57:44.400 --> 57:48.390
I'd live in terror, dreading every
race, every practice, every trial.

57:48.440 --> 57:51.230
- I cannot do it!
- Does he know this?

57:51.280 --> 57:55.240
He'd feel he should give it up but
I don't want that. He'd resent me.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.310
Oh, can't you find me some
Duke? There must be one spare.

57:59.360 --> 58:00.950
So I can put Edith in her place.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.830
You are the only woman I know who likes

58:04.880 --> 58:10.390
to think herself cold
and selfish and grand.

58:10.440 --> 58:12.910
Most of us spend our
lives trying to hide it.

58:12.960 --> 58:18.070
- Oh, Granny please don't lecture me
on sentimental virtues. - Don't worry.

58:18.120 --> 58:23.670
Don't worry. I believe in rules and
traditions and playing our part.

58:23.720 --> 58:26.750
But there is something else.

58:26.800 --> 58:28.790
And what is that, pray?

58:28.840 --> 58:31.760
I believe in love.

58:33.080 --> 58:38.920
I mean, brilliant careers, rich
lives, are seldom led without...

58:40.000 --> 58:42.240
.. just an element of love.

58:45.840 --> 58:48.240
Oh, Granny. You do surprise me.

58:49.280 --> 58:53.230
Oh, I am glad. So climbing all
those stairs wasn't wasted.

58:53.280 --> 58:55.350
(MARY LAUGHS)

58:55.400 --> 58:57.960
No, I would only say this.

58:58.760 --> 59:03.920
First, make peace with your sister.

59:06.400 --> 59:11.320
And then make peace with yourself.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.440
Oh, Mary.

59:24.480 --> 59:27.470
- Is Granny coming back for dinner?
- She didn't say so.

59:27.520 --> 59:31.550
She goes without telling us.
And returns without seeing us.

59:31.600 --> 59:35.070
We're in the dog house. How hard is
that to understand? Now, let's go.

59:35.120 --> 59:37.390
- Sure you don't want to come with us?
- Quite sure.

59:37.440 --> 59:39.990
You don't need me. You're
enough of a headline.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.440
And you certainly don't need me.

59:42.560 --> 59:47.110
- My Lord, I wonder if I might
have a word? - What is it?

59:47.160 --> 59:50.590
With your permission, I'd like
to tell Mr Barrow that he can stay

59:50.640 --> 59:53.750
for the time being at any rate. It
would take a weight off his mind.

59:53.800 --> 59:57.190
That's a relief. I was going
to suggest the same thing.

59:57.240 --> 01:00:02.070
- Were you, My Lord? - Yes. I feel
quite as guilty as you do, Carson.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.750
I tell you what I blame myself for.
I didn't credit him with feelings.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.310
I thought he was a man without
a heart. And I was wrong.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.520
No man is an island, Carson.
Not even Thomas Barrow.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.870
I ought to be very angry with you.
Summoning Granny to tick me off.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.910
I was amazed she came at my call.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.950
She said your letter was very
eloquent. She was quite persuaded.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.510
- So what are you going to do?
- As soon as Granny left I sent Henry

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.750
a telegram to get the next train.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.870
- Hopefully he'll be here by tea time.
- What about Edith?

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:43.630
That's a harder task. I'm
ready to say I'm sorry.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.350
But why should she want to forgive me?

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.150
- I got held up. Is she here yet?
- Miss Jones has arrived, yes, Lady Edith.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.300
- Why the mysterious face?
- You better go in.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.670
Ah. Edith.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.160
So this, it turns out,
is Miss Cassandra Jones.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.960
- Spratt?
- Good afternoon, Lady Edith.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.120
BOTH: Bananas!

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560
(BIRDSONG)

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.390
I don't have to tell you why I'm here.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.800
Either you know everything
or you're not hearing me now.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.680
The truth is... I love him.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.390
I believe we are right together

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.510
but I so very much want to feel

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.960
that you're happy for me, as I'd
be happy for you, my darling.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.520
Remember, however much I love him...

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.000
I will always love you.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.760
(SNIFFS)

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.990
- I often come at this time.
- I don't come often enough.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.180
No, no. It's only a habit.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.630
Actually, I came to ask
for his forgiveness,

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.550
if that doesn't sound too silly.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:03.160
I see. I think that means
you want to marry again.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.020
Well, I don't know if you
have his forgiveness...

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.840
.. but you don't need to
ask for mine. I'm delighted.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.390
- Anything else I can get you?
- One more mouthful and we'd explode.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.310
Unless there's another
of those delicious scones.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.670
Of course. Lucy, fetch the scones.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.550
- When does the photographer arrive?
- Five o'clock, M'Lady.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.230
I'm afraid some of the village have
caught on and they're waiting too.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.440
- Are you sure you want to do it?
- Oh, ye of little faith.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.400
- That's it. I'll leave you to it.
- You don't have to go, Tom.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.710
Believe me, I've been part of this
courtship for quite long enough.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.440
It's for you to manage from here.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.990
- Well?
- Well what?

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.310
Mary, the last time I saw you, you
threw me out for saying I loved you.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.110
Now you've whistled and I'm
here, but I don't know why.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.830
Because you were right. Because
we are in love with each other.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:30.630
I'm not sure why I fought it but
I've stopped fighting it now.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.110
I know I'm not what you were looking for.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.590
Tom and I once talked about
how marriage should be equal.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.670
It has nothing to do
with position or money,

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.680
simply that a couple should be
equal in both strength and passion.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.510
Should I ring for more tea?

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.790
Are you always so cool and
collected? I do hope so.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.470
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.830
Your words have made my
heart pound at such a rate

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.950
I'm surprised you can't hear it.
I'm hot, cold and can't breathe.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.800
- All because of you. - I must say,
you carry it off well. - Thanks.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.510
I need to know that you're certain.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.350
I am. I believe I've met my match. I have.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.750
I'm not 20, trembling at
the touch of your hand,

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.550
but I know that if I leave
you now I'll never be as happy

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.270
as we could've been together.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:26.230
I'm not 20 either but I still
tremble at the touch of your hands.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:31.640
- Me, too. I don't know why I said that.
- Oh, darling. Thank God for you.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:39.790
- So what do we do now? Elope to Gretna Green?
- Well, I have a confession.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.950
When I came here last I brought a
licence so we could marry at once.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.390
Doesn't the Archbishop of
Canterbury need to agree?

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.750
- Not if you can specify the Church.
- Well, you still need a bishop.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.430
- My uncle's a bishop. - Oh? Good old
England. Some things never change.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:58.110
But the point is, it's still valid
so shall we get married now?

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.630
- Now?
- Well, on Saturday.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.190
You don't want to have a huge
society affair again, do you?

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.670
- God, no. I've done that.
- Then will you?

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:12.200
Hmm. Well, I suppose I've come this far.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.400
Give it a moment, Mr Molesley.
Better give it a moment.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.470
If you're ready, My Lord. My Lady?

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.830
- We must have Mrs Patmore.
- Of course.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.910
- Oh, no, no, no. You don't want me.
- I insist.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.080
A picture to mark our
gratitude for a marvellous tea.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.720
Are we ready? Three, two, one.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.630
And you promise you haven't cheated?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.870
As God is my witness, I haven't set
eyes on her since yesterday lunch.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.070
- I even had breakfast in my room.
- (LAUGHS) That was Carson.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.120
He wouldn't take any chances
with Mary's happiness.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.590
Strange. I'll be best man
at both of her weddings.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.270
I hadn't thought of it.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.070
You've been a good friend
in this, Tom. Thank you.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.680
Pay me back by looking after her.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.160
Who's that?

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:33.150
What? I don't believe it! Why
didn't you say to expect you?

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.790
- Because I wasn't sure until I got
on the train. - How are you feeling?

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.430
Fine. Can you not ask me
that for the rest of the day?

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.680
- Could you leave us for a moment?
- Of course.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.500
We'll wait for you downstairs.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.110
You know I'm sorry.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.680
I assumed you would be fairly sorry
unless you're actually insane.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:06.790
I'm not insane but I am sorry, I
don't know why I did it. Not really.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.350
I've told you.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.510
Because you were unhappy so you
wanted me to be unhappy, too.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.279
Now you're happy again, you'll
be nicer... for a while.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.680
If that's what you feel,
then why are you here?

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.149
Because, in the end, you're my sister

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.479
and one day, only we
will remember Sybil...

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:39.950
.. or Mama or Papa or Matthew

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.430
or Michael or Granny or Carson

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:46.880
or any of the others who
have peopled our youth...

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:53.790
.. until, at last, our
shared memories will mean more

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.120
than our mutual dislike.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.380
What do you think he'd have made of it?

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:11.240
I went to his grave to tell
him, which isn't like me.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:16.760
Matthew loved you and
wanted you to be happy.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.399
I'm sure he'd be very, very
pleased. In fact, I know he would.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.000
- You look nice, by the way.
- Thank you.

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:43.520
You'd better go in and find a
seat. I'll wait for her here.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.870
- Amelia said you called on her.
- Yes. I did. We were talking about Larry.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.550
- Really? Was it productive?
- That rather depends on him.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.190
But surely she was --

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.720
The ball is in Larry's court,
Lord Merton, only he can play it.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.920
Those whom God hath joined
together let no man put asunder.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:29.470
For as much as Henry and Mary have
consented together in Holy Wedlock

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.440
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:41.070
.. and thereto have given and
pledged their troth either to other,

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.110
and have declared the same by
giving and receiving of a ring,

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.360
and by joining of hands...

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.120
.. I pronounce that they
be man and wife together.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.920
In the Name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.040
- Amen. - Amen. - Amen.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.550
MAN IN CROWD: Congratulations, Henry!

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.070
Thank you.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.910
That was a treat, but we'll pay for it now

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.960
if we don't get home
to serve the breakfast.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.670
Well, Mr Talbot. You have
swept me off my feet.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.000
- I promise you won't be sorry.
- I'd better not be.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.800
There they go, a new
couple in a new world.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
(CHEERING)

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.710
It seems all our ships
are coming into port.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.070
- And Edith? - Of all my children,
Edith has given me the most surprises.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.910
Yes, surprises of the most mixed variety.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.030
A surprise is a surprise, Mama,

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.320
and I'm sure we haven't
seen the last one yet.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.800
