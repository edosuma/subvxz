WEBVTT

00:01.467 --> 00:02.300
- HELLO, DEARS.

00:02.300 --> 00:03.733
- HEY, MARIE.
- HEY.

00:03.733 --> 00:06.267
- OH, DEBRA,
I NEED MY BIG SPOON BACK.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.900
I'M MAKING CAKES.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.267
- OH, SURE.
FOR THE BAKE SALE?

00:09.267 --> 00:11.167
- FOR THE BAKE SALE?

00:11.167 --> 00:15.467
LET'S BE HONEST.
MY CAKES ARE THE BAKE SALE.

00:15.467 --> 00:17.100
- I'M MAKING CUPCAKES THIS YEAR.

00:17.100 --> 00:22.933
- OH, I THINK THAT'S SWEET
YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP.

00:22.933 --> 00:25.067
I WOULDN'T MAKE TOO MANY.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.200
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.267
I JUST NEEDED MY BIG SPOON.

00:30.267 --> 00:32.467
THANKS.
BACK TO BAKING.

00:32.467 --> 00:33.933
OH, AND I'M GONNA
SEND YOUR FATHER OVER.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.133
OKAY, GOOD-BYE.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.133
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- WHAT?

00:37.133 --> 00:38.833
WHY IS HE COMING OVER HERE?

00:38.833 --> 00:41.867
BECAUSE I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE,
AND I CAN'T HAVE HIM THERE.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.567
- WELL, I DON'T WANT HIM HERE.

00:43.567 --> 00:47.600
YESTERDAY, HE WAS SHOWING THE
KIDS HOW TO BURP OUT A CANDLE.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.000
- THAT'S WHY I WANT HIM OUT.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.233
I'M WORKING WITH FOOD.

00:50.233 --> 00:53.800
IT'S A MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.600
OH, PLEASE.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.433
I DO A LOT
OF BABYSITTING FOR YOU.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.200
- YEAH, BUT OUR KIDS
DON'T CURSE AS MUCH.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.033
- ALLY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO THE PARK WITH GRANDPA?

01:10.033 --> 01:12.733
- NO, THANKS.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.367
- RAYMOND,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM

01:16.367 --> 01:18.033
TO ONE OF YOUR SPORTS GAMES?

01:18.033 --> 01:21.567
- I'M NOT TAKING HIM TO ANY
OF MY SPORTS GAMES, OKAY?

01:21.567 --> 01:22.967
BESIDES,
THE ONLY FOOTBALL AROUND

01:22.967 --> 01:23.967
IS HOFSTRA AND NORTHEASTERN.

01:23.967 --> 01:25.633
THEY'RE BOTH 0-7.

01:25.633 --> 01:28.800
IT'S LIKE WATCHIN' THE KIDS
HAVE A TICKLE FIGHT.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.233
- WELL, YOUR FATHER ALREADY
HAS HIS OUTSIDE PANTS ON,

01:31.233 --> 01:32.900
SO I'M SENDING HIM OVER.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.900
- NO!
COME ON, MA.

01:34.900 --> 01:37.133
- HEY, HEY.
WHAT'S SHAKIN', EVERYBODY?

01:37.133 --> 01:38.600
- HEY.
HEY, ROBERT.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.567
WHO DO YOU LIKE
IN THE BIG GAME TODAY?

01:40.567 --> 01:41.733
- WHAT BIG GAME?

01:41.733 --> 01:44.733
- HOFSTRA AND NORTHEASTERN.
WHERE YA BEEN?

01:44.733 --> 01:47.100
TSS...
HUH?

01:50.467 --> 01:54.167
- WHAT'S WITH THAT?
[chuckles]

01:57.267 --> 01:59.300
- I REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN
FOLLOWING HOFSTRA.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.133
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS IS THEIR YEAR.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.467
AND NORTHEASTERN?

02:02.467 --> 02:05.467
IT'S LIKE
CLASH OF THE TITANS TODAY.

02:05.467 --> 02:06.400
- YEAH?

02:06.400 --> 02:08.200
- YOU WANT TO GO
OR NOT?

02:08.200 --> 02:11.067
- REALLY?

02:11.067 --> 02:12.600
- HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.333
- NO, NO, NO. I'LL GO.
I'LL GO. I WANT TO GO.

02:14.333 --> 02:17.000
- ALL RIGHT.
GOOD.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.567
- OKAY, GREAT.
GO GET DAD AND GO.

02:19.567 --> 02:22.467
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT.

02:22.467 --> 02:23.733
ME AND DAD?

02:23.733 --> 02:25.000
- THAT'S RIGHT, DEAR.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.067
THERE'S GONNA BE
A BIG TICKLE FIGHT.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.733
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:33.733 --> 02:35.400
IF YOU WANT TO BEAT THE TRAFFIC,
YOU BETTER GET GOIN'.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.133
- WELL, WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT COMIN'?

02:37.133 --> 02:39.533
- I WISH. I WISH.
I CAN'T CATCH A BREAK.

02:39.533 --> 02:43.367
I GOT TO WORK ON
THE FRICKIN' BAKE SALE ALL DAY.

02:43.367 --> 02:44.433
WITCHY-POO HAS GOT ME

02:44.433 --> 02:48.967
FROSTING UP THE CUPCAKES
ALL DAY.

02:48.967 --> 02:52.267
- AH, THE PERILS
OF MARRIAGE, HUH?

02:52.267 --> 02:53.533
THAT'S TOO BAD, RAYMOND.

02:53.533 --> 02:55.900
WELL, I'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT YA.

02:55.900 --> 02:59.667
- I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.033
SUCKER!

03:04.900 --> 03:06.800
- WITCHY-POO?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.400
- YEAH.
THAT WAS GREAT.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.967
THE FACE THAT YOU MADE
WHEN I SAID IT,

03:09.967 --> 03:11.433
IT WAS PERFECT, YEAH.

03:11.433 --> 03:14.633
YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT, YEAH.

03:14.633 --> 03:17.300
OKAY, YOU CAN STOP NOW.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.700
- GO WITH DAD TO THE GAME.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.067
WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

03:40.067 --> 03:41.500
- WHAT'S ON YOUR SHIRT?

03:41.500 --> 03:44.833
- NACHO CHEESE.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.567
- MY INTRODUCTION, PLEASE.

03:47.567 --> 03:50.000
- YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT YOU DID?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.167
- JUST INTRODUCE ME!

03:56.633 --> 04:01.333
- LYNN SWANN, JERRY RICE,
AND NOW FRANK BARONE.

04:05.167 --> 04:07.700
- WHAT,
YOU BOUGHT A FOOTBALL?

04:07.700 --> 04:09.533
- NO BOUGHT--
CAUGHT.

04:09.533 --> 04:10.567
ROBERT.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.100
- HEY, LOOK,
I DID YOUR INTRO, DAD.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.600
I'M DONE.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.333
- HEY, YOU WERE A WITNESS
TO GLORY.

04:15.333 --> 04:18.167
HISTORY DEMANDS
YOUR TESTIMONY.

04:18.167 --> 04:19.600
- WHAT HAPPENED?

04:19.600 --> 04:23.300
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
IN SPITE OF THE HYPE,

04:23.300 --> 04:28.733
TODAY'S GAME
WAS NOT A GREAT MATCHUP.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.600
- COME ON, REALLY?

04:30.600 --> 04:33.167
- BUT AT THE END,
THIS KID FROM HOFSTRA

04:33.167 --> 04:35.100
KICKS AN UNBELIEVABLE
FIELD GOAL.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.967
- 68 YARDS.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.167
- 68-YARD FIELD GOAL?

04:38.167 --> 04:40.833
- YEP, THE LONGEST EVER,
COLLEGE OR PRO.

04:40.833 --> 04:47.567
COME ON, ROBERT, TELL IT
LIKE YOU'RE NOT A GELDING.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.567
- WELL, WE HAD SEATS
BEHIND THE END ZONE,

04:49.567 --> 04:51.500
AND DAD GOT LUCKY.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.533
- LUCK IS THE RESIDUE
OF DESIGN.

04:53.533 --> 04:54.633
- WHAT?

04:54.633 --> 04:57.033
- SHUT UP.
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN IT.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.467
IT WAS A ROCKET.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.267
I GOT MY HANDS READY
FOR IT.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.400
- BY DUMPING
HIS NACHOS SOMEWHERE.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.700
- IT CAME TOWARDS ME.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.633
EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO GET
THEIR MITTS ON IT,

05:07.633 --> 05:09.600
BUT I PUT THE MOVES
ON ALL OF THEM.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.533
I JUMPED OVER A GUY.

05:11.533 --> 05:15.633
- YOU PUSHED A KID
OUT OF THE WAY.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.833
- I JUMPED OVER A GUY.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.300
IT WAS COMING IN HIGH.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.767
I HAD TO STRETCH FOR IT.

05:20.767 --> 05:23.567
I COULD GET ONLY ONE HAND ON IT,
BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH.

05:23.567 --> 05:27.667
I BROUGHT THAT LITTLE PIGGY
RIGHT DOWN INTO MY CHEST.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.167
HELLO, LITTLE PIGGY.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.033
- AND THEN HE WENT,
"WHEE-WHEE-WHEE,"

05:36.033 --> 05:39.267
ALL THE WAY HOME.

05:39.267 --> 05:41.900
- IT WAS THE BIGGEST MOMENT EVER
IN HOFSTRA HISTORY,

05:41.900 --> 05:43.367
AND I HAVE IT.

05:43.367 --> 05:47.100
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD
THE CROWD CHANTING FOR ME.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.167
- GIVE IT BACK, JERK!

05:49.167 --> 05:51.633
GIVE IT BACK, JERK!

05:51.633 --> 05:54.033
- AND BOOING.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.333
- WAIT, DAD, DAD.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.400
HOFSTRA'S GOT TO WANT
THAT BALL BACK.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.700
- YOU BET YOUR ASS THEY DO.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.967
I HAD TO PUT THE RAZZLE-DAZZLE
ON A COUPLE OF MOOKS

06:01.967 --> 06:04.133
JUST TO GET OUT OF THE STANDS.

06:04.133 --> 06:07.300
- FRANK, THAT'S A RECORD
FOR THE SCHOOL.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.833
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT
TO KEEP THAT, DON'T YOU?

06:09.833 --> 06:11.333
- DON'T BOTHER, DEB.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.667
HIS SOUL WAS REMOVED
TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE STOMACH.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.200
- A FAN
IS SUPPOSED TO DO

06:25.200 --> 06:27.100
WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE TEAM.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.200
- THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT THIS--

06:28.200 --> 06:32.700
I'M NOT A FAN.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.400
THOSE KIDS STINK.

06:35.400 --> 06:39.200
EXCEPT FOR THE KICKER.
THANKS, PAL!

06:39.200 --> 06:41.367
- CHARMING, NO?

06:41.367 --> 06:42.967
- HEY, DAD,
I'D GIVE THE BALL BACK.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.700
- THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T CATCH IT.

06:45.700 --> 06:48.100
COME ON, ROBERT.
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

06:48.100 --> 06:50.500
- TO THE LODGE
TO TELL THE STORY.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.467
YOU GO IN BEFORE ME
AND BUILD ME UP.

06:53.467 --> 06:57.467
I DON'T LIKE TO TOOT
MY OWN HORN.

06:57.467 --> 07:01.133
- NO, NO, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT.

07:01.133 --> 07:02.467
- OH, YEAH?

07:02.467 --> 07:06.133
HOW WAS LIVING
IN MY HOUSE FOR 40 YEARS?

07:06.133 --> 07:09.133
WAS THAT COMFORTABLE?

07:09.133 --> 07:11.333
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.900
- I BELIEVE YOU WERE COMFORTABLE
EATING MY FOOD,

07:13.900 --> 07:15.633
WATCHING MY TV,

07:15.633 --> 07:17.700
WEARING THE SPRINGS
OUT OF MY FURNITURE

07:17.700 --> 07:20.267
WITH YOUR TWO-TON RUMP.

07:22.867 --> 07:25.233
- ALL RIGHT!

07:33.800 --> 07:36.233
- RAYMOND?

07:36.233 --> 07:38.367
TASTE THIS.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.133
- GOOD.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.533
- HOW GOOD?

07:44.533 --> 07:46.200
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY
FOR THIS WHOLE CAKE

07:46.200 --> 07:47.467
AT THE BAKE SALE?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.800
- UH, $10?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.867
- $10?

07:51.867 --> 07:53.867
- ALL RIGHT.

07:53.867 --> 07:57.667
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.367
$1,000.

07:59.367 --> 08:03.433
- YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET BOY.

08:03.433 --> 08:05.167
- HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY
FOR MY CUPCAKES?

08:05.167 --> 08:07.833
- A MILLION DOLLARS.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.267
- WHERE'S THE RADIO?
WHERE'S THE RADIO?

08:09.267 --> 08:10.900
- WHAT, WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:10.900 --> 08:13.733
- I HEARD IT DRIVING OVER.
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DAD.

08:13.733 --> 08:14.833
- WHO IS?

08:14.833 --> 08:16.200
- THE SPORTS SHOW!

08:16.200 --> 08:17.600
- OH, NO!

08:17.600 --> 08:19.567
- HEY, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THAT GUY IS?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.067
I'LL TELL YA,
HE'S A JACKASS.

08:21.067 --> 08:25.133
- [gasps]
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HIM.

08:25.133 --> 08:27.300
- OH, MAN,
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS GUY--

08:27.300 --> 08:29.333
BULLDOZES A KID
GETTIN' THE BALL.

08:29.333 --> 08:35.633
THEN HE HIGHTAILS IT
OUT OF THERE WITH SOME BIG GOON.

08:35.633 --> 08:39.000
- HEY, HE WAS MY RIDE!

08:39.000 --> 08:40.300
- THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.433
IT NEVER ENDS
WITH YOUR FATHER.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.267
- BOY, HOT TOPIC.
LINES ARE LIT UP.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.200
LET'S GO TO FRANK
IN LYNBROOK.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.833
- YEAH, THIS IS THE JACKASS.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.667
I CAUGHT THAT BALL,
AND ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T LIKE IT

08:52.667 --> 08:55.433
CAN KISS ME
BETWEEN THE BACK POCKETS.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.933
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

08:57.933 --> 08:59.233
- WAIT A MINUTE.

08:59.233 --> 09:00.733
YOU'RE TELLING US
YOU'RE THE GUY?

09:00.733 --> 09:02.600
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.467
- AND YOU'RE PROUD
OF WHAT YOU DID?

09:04.467 --> 09:05.633
- YOU BET I AM!

09:05.633 --> 09:07.400
- SO WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU DESERVE THE BALL?

09:07.400 --> 09:08.800
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP IT?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.867
- NO, I'LL GIVE IT BACK...

09:10.867 --> 09:12.867
FOR TEN GRAND.

09:12.867 --> 09:15.000
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.333
- $10,000.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.133
- THE BIDDING STARTS
AT $10,000, YES.

09:20.133 --> 09:22.467
- UNBELIEVABLE.

09:22.467 --> 09:23.667
- SO, DAVE ON LINE ONE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:23.667 --> 09:24.933
- WHAT DO I THINK?

09:24.933 --> 09:29.000
I THINK THIS FRANK
DESERVES TO BE KICKED 68 YARDS.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.133
- FINALLY, A VOICE OF REASON.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.533
- FRANK, YOU'RE TELLING ME

09:34.533 --> 09:36.333
RON FERNANDEZ
DOESN'T DESERVE THE BALL?

09:36.333 --> 09:39.067
- WHO THE HELL
IS RON FERNANDEZ?

09:39.067 --> 09:41.867
- THE PLAYER
WHO KICKED THE FIELD GOAL.

09:41.867 --> 09:45.733
- WELL, HIS MONEY'S
AS GOOD AS ANYONE ELSE'S.

09:45.733 --> 09:49.267
- WHY DO YOU LET HIM
USE THE PHONE?

09:49.267 --> 09:51.667
- I GOT AN IDEA--
ALL YOU WHINERS

09:51.667 --> 09:53.133
WHO THINK THIS KID
SHOULD HAVE THE BALL

09:53.133 --> 09:54.500
CAN TAKE UP A COLLECTION

09:54.500 --> 09:57.567
AND SEND IT TO FRANK BARONE,
ENTREPRENEUR.

09:57.567 --> 10:00.267
- OH, NO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE SAID THAT!

10:00.267 --> 10:03.300
- I KNOW, "ENTREPRENEUR."

10:03.300 --> 10:05.133
- NO, BARONE!
BARONE!

10:05.133 --> 10:06.700
HE USED
OUR LAST NAME!

10:06.700 --> 10:09.067
- THIS IS GONNA DRIVE DOWN
THE PRICE OF MY CAKES.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.500
- WAIT A MINUTE.
BARONE?

10:10.500 --> 10:13.000
ANY RELATION TO RAY BARONE,
THE SPORTSWRITER?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.800
- NO! NO!

10:15.800 --> 10:17.600
- SURE, HE'S MY SON.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.867
- NOOOOOOOO!

10:18.867 --> 10:22.100
- OH, MY CAKE!
MY CAKE!

10:22.100 --> 10:24.300
- DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HE SAID?

10:24.300 --> 10:28.733
HOW COULD HE SAY THAT?

10:28.733 --> 10:30.333
- OH, THAT EXPLAINS IT.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.667
OH, I HATE THAT GUY'S COLUMN.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.967
HE THINKS HE'S SO FUNNY.
HE BLOWS!

10:33.967 --> 10:35.167
- HEY.

10:35.167 --> 10:41.167
- MAN,
I SHOULD BE TAPING THIS.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.633
- ALL RIGHT, WE GOT TO TAKE
A QUICK BREAK.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.067
FRANK, WE GOT
A WHOLE BUNCH OF CALLERS

10:44.067 --> 10:45.067
WHO WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.467
CAN YOU STAY WITH US?

10:46.467 --> 10:47.800
- I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I GOT TO HIT THE HEAD,

10:47.800 --> 10:51.667
AND THE CORD
WON'T REACH THAT FAR.

10:51.667 --> 10:55.067
- AND ON THAT LOVELY NOTE,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.900
- FRANK?

11:02.900 --> 11:06.900
I MADE YOU A SNACK.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.167
- THANK YOU.

11:10.167 --> 11:14.533
- OH, FRANK, HOLD THE SANDWICH
WITH TWO HANDS LIKE A PERSON.

11:14.533 --> 11:16.733
- I'M ALL RIGHT.

11:22.167 --> 11:29.133
- SO, UM...

11:29.133 --> 11:32.033
FRANK, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE TURN OFF THE TV...

11:32.033 --> 11:34.300
CHI-CHI?

11:34.300 --> 11:36.400
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:36.400 --> 11:37.833
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING?

11:37.833 --> 11:40.067
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
YOU BEEN DRINKIN'?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.300
- NO!

11:41.300 --> 11:42.533
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

11:42.533 --> 11:43.900
- I'M TAKIN' THIS BALL

11:43.900 --> 11:45.067
BACK TO HOFSTRA,
WHERE IT BELONGS.

11:45.067 --> 11:48.000
- YOU FLOOZY!

11:48.000 --> 11:49.167
YOU'RE NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE!

11:49.167 --> 11:50.700
- OH, YES, I AM!

11:50.700 --> 11:53.533
- JUST GIVE ME THAT BALL BACK,
AND NOBODY GETS HURT.

11:53.533 --> 11:54.800
- NOW! NOW!

11:54.800 --> 11:58.367
- OKAY!

11:58.367 --> 11:59.667
HEY, THE DOOR IS LOCKED!

11:59.667 --> 12:01.100
WHAT DID YOU LOCK
THE DOOR FOR?

12:01.100 --> 12:02.967
AH!

12:02.967 --> 12:06.100
- OKAY!
- I'M OPEN, MA!

12:06.100 --> 12:07.867
- LET ME GO!
LET ME GO!

12:07.867 --> 12:10.400
LET ME GO,
YOU WITCHES!

12:14.367 --> 12:16.000
- ROBERT, THROW IT!

12:16.000 --> 12:19.200
ROBERT, THROW IT!

12:19.200 --> 12:21.667
[glass shatters]

12:35.967 --> 12:40.033
- SORRY!

12:40.033 --> 12:42.067
- IDIOT!

12:54.833 --> 12:57.300
[engine turns over]

13:02.967 --> 13:04.600
- HA-HA!
- GET OUT OF HERE, DAD!

13:04.600 --> 13:08.433
- YOU SHOULD LOCK YOUR DOORS.
IT'S A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:13.633 --> 13:16.067
- HEY, DEB,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

13:16.067 --> 13:18.967
- I MANAGED TO THROW THE BALL
VERY WELL.

13:18.967 --> 13:24.633
- WELL, I THOUGHT RAY WAS
CUTTIN' BACK TOWARD THE WINDOW.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.600
- A CLOSED WINDOW?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.100
- WELL, I COULDN'T TELL
IT WAS CLOSED.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.900
THE GLASS LOOKED VERY CLEAN.

13:31.900 --> 13:37.933
- ALL RIGHT, NOBODY
BELIEVES YOU ANYMORE, ROBERT.

13:37.933 --> 13:39.800
- OH, HEY, LISTEN.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.800
I THINK I GOT SOMETHIN' HERE
THAT'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF DAD.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.800
- ARE THOSE THE PAPERS
TO HAVE HIM COMMITTED?

13:43.800 --> 13:45.267
- YEAH.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.367
HA-HA, VERY FUNNY.
OKAY.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.100
THIS IS MY COLUMN
FOR TOMORROW MORNING.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.633
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME READ IT TO YOU.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.433
IT'LL BE GOOD TO GET
A PERSPECTIVE FROM PEOPLE

13:52.433 --> 13:54.000
WHO READ MY COLUMN EVERY DAY.

14:00.633 --> 14:01.867
OHH.

14:01.867 --> 14:03.333
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.200
YOU DON'T READ MY COLUMN?

14:05.200 --> 14:09.733
- IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT SPORTS.

14:09.733 --> 14:11.167
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

14:11.167 --> 14:16.967
- I USED TO READ IT A LOT
WHEN WE WERE DATING.

14:16.967 --> 14:19.600
- I GET THE TIMES.

14:22.933 --> 14:25.533
- JUST LISTEN!

14:25.533 --> 14:28.600
"MY FATHER IS THE REASON
I BECAME A SPORTSWRITER.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.000
"GROWING UP, HE TOOK ME
TO EVERY GAME HE COULD,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.767
"TEACHING ME TO APPRECIATE
THE THRILL OF COMPETITION,

14:33.767 --> 14:35.133
"THE GRACE OF ATHLETES,

14:35.133 --> 14:38.200
"AND THE WONDER
OF A PROPERLY TOPPED HOT DOG.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.767
"BUT SADLY, MY FATHER
HAS BECOME A SYMBOL

14:40.767 --> 14:43.333
"OF WHAT IS WRONG
WITH SPORTS TODAY.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.867
"MY FATHER IS FRANK BARONE,

"WHO IS NOW HOLDING A FOOTBALL

"HOPING TO SQUEEZE OUT
A COUPLE OF DOLLARS

"NO LONGER SHARE
THE SAME IDEA OF SPORTS

"OR, FOR THAT MATTER, LIFE.

14:59.767 --> 15:02.467
"AND BECAUSE HE'LL NEVER
APOLOGIZE, I'LL DO IT.

15:02.467 --> 15:06.200
"SORRY, RON FERNANDEZ.
SORRY, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.500
"SORRY, SPORTS FANS EVERYWHERE.
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.733
WE ALL DO."

15:12.733 --> 15:13.733
SO?

15:13.733 --> 15:14.733
- WOW.

15:14.733 --> 15:15.967
- NOT BAD.

15:15.967 --> 15:19.233
I SHOULD READ YOUR STUFF
MORE OFTEN.

15:19.233 --> 15:22.000
- IT'S BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN
AND SO HONEST.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.267
- MM-HMM.

15:23.267 --> 15:25.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GIVE ME THAT!

15:25.600 --> 15:27.367
YOU JUST SAID
THAT IT WAS GOOD!

15:27.367 --> 15:29.233
- IT'S EXCEPTIONAL,
BUT YOU CAN'T PRINT THAT.

15:29.233 --> 15:31.267
YOU DON'T ATTACK
YOUR FAMILY IN PUBLIC.

15:31.267 --> 15:32.633
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:32.633 --> 15:35.000
YOU TOOK A SWING AT HIM
AT THE MALL LAST WEEK.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.333
- THAT'S DIFFERENT.

15:36.333 --> 15:40.000
HE WAS DOING SKITS
IN THE LINGERIE STORE.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.167
- ALL RIGHT, MA,
LOOK.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.233
HE HAS TO PUBLISH THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

15:43.233 --> 15:45.000
DAD IS A MENACE,
AND HE'S GOT TO BE STOPPED.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.533
- SEE?

15:46.533 --> 15:51.867
- I'M WITH YOU
ALL THE WAY, BROTHER.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.933
- RAY, YOUR MOM
HAS A POINT.

15:53.933 --> 15:56.733
- OH, MY GOD.

15:56.733 --> 15:59.300
- I MEAN, I JUST DON'T THINK
THIS IS GONNA GET THE BALL BACK.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.633
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO,

16:00.633 --> 16:06.600
DRAW UP ANOTHER PLAY
FOR FRAN TARKENTON HERE?

16:06.600 --> 16:07.967
- THIS IS JUST
GONNA MAKE FRANK

16:07.967 --> 16:10.200
DIG HIS HEELS IN
EVEN MORE.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.600
- THINK OF OUR FAMILY,
RAYMOND.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.500
IT'LL ONLY DESTROY
OUR HARMONY.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.367
- HARMONY?

16:17.367 --> 16:18.600
ARE YOU HEARING THIS?

16:18.600 --> 16:20.933
- ARE YOU?
BECAUSE SHE'S RIGHT.

16:20.933 --> 16:25.000
- WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.100
- I STILL GOT IT.

16:27.100 --> 16:32.667
IT'S JUST OVER HERE NOW.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.333
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:34.333 --> 16:35.700
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK,
ALL RIGHT?

16:35.700 --> 16:37.733
PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW
THAT I AM NOT LIKE HIM.

16:37.733 --> 16:39.400
- OH, REALLY?

16:39.400 --> 16:41.767
OKAY, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT THIS
WAS ABOUT GETTING THE BALL BACK,

16:41.767 --> 16:42.967
BUT IF YOU JUST WANT
TO CLEAR YOUR NAME,

16:42.967 --> 16:44.333
THEN THIS WILL DO IT.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.767
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
PUBLISH IT, THEN.

16:45.767 --> 16:49.133
- DON'T TRY AND PULL
THAT "TELL ME TO DO IT

16:49.133 --> 16:52.300
SO I DON'T DO IT"
FLIPPITY-FLOO, OKAY?

16:52.300 --> 16:53.500
I'M GONNA DO IT.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.667
YOU THINK THIS
IS GONNA STOP ME?

16:54.667 --> 16:56.433
ALL I NEED
IS A PIECE OF TAPE.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.800
NO. I CAN JUST
PRINT IT UP AGAIN.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.000
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.
YEAH.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.767
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:00.767 --> 17:03.433
I'M GONNA MAKE IT EVEN STRONGER.
THERE'S STUFF THAT I LEFT OUT.

17:03.433 --> 17:05.333
THAT'S THE POWER
OF THE PRESS, PEOPLE.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.767
AND DON'T ANY OF YOU
TRY TO STOP ME,

17:06.767 --> 17:10.033
OR I'LL WRITE SOMETHIN'
ABOUT YOU.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.167
- WHAT KIND OF STUFF
YOU THINK HE'D WRITE?

17:17.167 --> 17:18.600
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
ROBERT.

17:18.600 --> 17:21.733
- I HAD A SLIGHT
BED-WETTING PROBLEM.

17:28.933 --> 17:33.067
[loud cracking]

17:40.200 --> 17:42.233
- [humming]

17:42.233 --> 17:44.867
- HEY, DAD,
YOU DOWN HERE?

17:44.867 --> 17:45.967
[door slams]

17:45.967 --> 17:47.600
HEY.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.800
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:48.800 --> 17:50.667
- LOOK, I TRIED
A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

17:50.667 --> 17:52.267
TO GET YOU TO DO
WHAT'S RIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

17:52.267 --> 17:54.067
I WAS EVEN GONNA PUBLISH
AN ARTICLE ABOUT YOU,

17:54.067 --> 17:55.367
BUT SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT

17:55.367 --> 17:57.500
IT WOULD SCREW UP
OUR FAMILY HARMONY.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.900
SO I'M GONNA
TRY SOMETHIN' ELSE.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.100
- FAMILY HARMONY?

18:01.100 --> 18:02.567
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

18:02.567 --> 18:07.933
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
COME ON DOWN.

18:07.933 --> 18:09.867
COME ON.
COME ON DOWN. IT'S OKAY.

18:09.867 --> 18:13.100
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

18:13.100 --> 18:14.967
- THIS IS RON FERNANDEZ,
DAD.

18:14.967 --> 18:16.200
- WHO?

18:16.200 --> 18:18.900
- THE GUY WHO KICKED
THE BALL, DAD.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.200
AND THIS IS HIS FATHER.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.033
- OH, JEEZALOO,
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

18:24.033 --> 18:25.100
- GO AHEAD.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.733
- UH, WELL, UH...

18:27.733 --> 18:29.133
MR. BARONE,

18:29.133 --> 18:31.733
THAT WAS REALLY IMPRESSIVE
THE WAY YOU, UH...

18:31.733 --> 18:34.967
CAUGHT THAT BALL.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.600
I THINK THAT WAS
A REALLY GREAT CATCH.

18:36.600 --> 18:41.267
- YOU ARE A REAL
PIECE OF WORK.

18:41.267 --> 18:45.633
- WE CAN'T AFFORD 10,000,
MR. BARONE.

18:45.633 --> 18:49.000
I CAN PAY YOU 500.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.633
PLEASE.
I WANT IT FOR MY SON.

19:13.967 --> 19:18.400
- CAPTAIN HUGGLES?

19:18.400 --> 19:20.467
- KEEP YOUR MONEY.
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

19:20.467 --> 19:23.333
GOD FORBID
I SHOULD MAKE A BUCK.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.567
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHIN'.

19:25.567 --> 19:27.633
I KNOW WHAT THIS BALL
IS WORTH,

19:27.633 --> 19:29.900
SO I BETTER NOT SEE YOU
SELLIN' IT.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.067
- NO, SIR.

19:32.067 --> 19:36.200
- I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T
HAVE THEM HOLDING A PUPPY.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.867
HERE.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.767
- THANK YOU.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.033
THIS IS FOR YOU, DAD.

19:51.033 --> 19:52.467
- WHAT?

19:52.467 --> 19:54.600
NO, IT'S YOURS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE IT.

19:54.600 --> 19:59.067
- NO. YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOT ME STARTED, DAD.

19:59.067 --> 20:02.467
I KICKED IT FOR YOU.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.000
GO ON.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.733
- [sighs]

20:13.100 --> 20:14.267
- OKAY?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
- THANK YOU, MR. BARONE.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.367
YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN.

20:32.933 --> 20:33.967
- YOU SEE THAT?

20:33.967 --> 20:35.400
- YEAH.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.733
- YOU SEE HOW NICE
THAT KID WAS TO HIS FATHER?

20:46.333 --> 20:49.667
YOU OWE ME TEN GRAND!

20:56.667 --> 20:58.000
[engine turns over]

20:58.000 --> 20:59.933
- IF THE KNICKS ARE EVER GONNA
COMPETE WITH THE LAKERS,

20:59.933 --> 21:01.733
THEY NEED TO BE
BIGGER UP FRONT.

21:01.733 --> 21:03.767
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU ALL
HAVE TO SAY.

21:03.767 --> 21:04.933
ROBERT FROM LYNBROOK.

21:04.933 --> 21:07.767
- UH, YEAH. HEY, GARY.

21:07.767 --> 21:13.867
LONGTIME LISTENER,
FIRST-TIME CALLER.

21:13.867 --> 21:16.967
I JUST WANT TO SAY
I HEARD THAT FRANK BARONE

21:16.967 --> 21:18.200
GAVE THAT BALL BACK,

21:18.200 --> 21:19.400
AND I THINK HE SHOWED

21:19.400 --> 21:24.267
THE TRUE SPIRIT
OF AMERICAN HARMONY.

21:24.267 --> 21:25.267
- WELL, THANK YOU, ROBERT.

21:25.267 --> 21:26.600
I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU,

21:26.600 --> 21:28.000
BUT WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE KNICKS.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.933
- ABSOLUTELY.
ONE MORE THING...

21:29.933 --> 21:35.733
I LIKED WHEN THE GUY SAID,
"RAY BARONE BLOWS."

21:35.733 --> 21:39.967
LET'S HEAR MORE FROM HIM.
[laughs]

21:39.967 --> 21:42.367
RAY BARONE.

21:45.333 --> 21:48.167
- LAUGH IT UP,
PEE-PEE PANTS.
