WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.109
Previously on...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.116
You're glowing today,
you know that?

00:04.140 --> 00:06.413
Gabrielle got pregnant...
You walked out onme.

00:06.437 --> 00:10.117
Yeah, but look how far I got.
I'm just up the street.

00:10.141 --> 00:11.158
Trouble moved in...

00:11.182 --> 00:13.490
Being with George made you
feel a bit guilty.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.093
Well, I'll just have to
get over it, won't I?

00:16.117 --> 00:18.265
And Bree moved on... "I know
who really killed Melanie foster."

00:18.289 --> 00:20.427
"You arrested the wrong man"?

00:20.451 --> 00:22.069
But not everyone...

00:22.093 --> 00:23.370
Call 9-1-1 and tell 'em

00:23.394 --> 00:25.441
you got a killer locked up in
the basement. He is not a killer.

00:25.465 --> 00:28.226
Got what they deserved.

00:31.562 --> 00:37.184
It is often said that necessity
is the mother of invention.

00:37.208 --> 00:40.617
This is how mothers
came to invent play dates...

00:40.641 --> 00:44.020
So they occasionally could have
a little time for themselves.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.531
If you need me,
I'll be at the salon.

00:46.555 --> 00:48.525
But there are some mothers

00:48.549 --> 00:52.129
who don't get to take advantage
of this maternal innovation...

00:52.153 --> 00:54.601
Mothers like Lynette Scavo,

00:54.625 --> 00:57.264
who was no longer able
to rest on weekends

00:57.288 --> 01:02.239
because her twins no longer
received play date invitations,

01:02.263 --> 01:05.180
ever since they had convinced
Sasha Eden's boy

01:05.203 --> 01:08.766
that a pair of magic wings
would allow him to fly.

01:10.141 --> 01:12.749
And they had double-dared
Sharon chazin's boy

01:12.773 --> 01:17.254
to ride his bike blindfolded.

01:17.278 --> 01:20.287
And they had encouraged
Lisa siegmann's boy

01:20.311 --> 01:25.332
to try an exciting new game
called "toss the brick."

01:25.356 --> 01:29.736
The Scavo twins had become
persona non grata,

01:29.760 --> 01:31.238
and Lynette's secret dream

01:31.262 --> 01:35.502
of being able to take
an occasional nap on Saturdays

01:35.526 --> 01:38.705
was growing dimmer and dimmer...

01:38.729 --> 01:40.107
Aah!

01:41.502 --> 01:43.180
Until one day...

01:43.204 --> 01:46.118
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Porter, Preston, knock it off!

01:46.142 --> 01:48.315
All right? Did you hear me?
I said stop it. Stand up.

01:48.339 --> 01:50.817
Stand up. Come here.

01:50.841 --> 01:53.690
I'm so sorry.
Did my son beat you up?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.371
No. We were beatingthemup.

01:55.395 --> 01:58.165
Is that true?
Did they beat you up?

01:58.189 --> 01:59.366
Ah, it didn't hurt that much.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.368
Jimmy, p.J., what are you doing?

02:01.392 --> 02:05.832
What have I told you
about ganging up on people?

02:05.856 --> 02:07.274
I am so sorry.

02:07.298 --> 02:09.104
No, it's okay.
You know, believe me,

02:09.128 --> 02:11.107
my boys can take care
of themselves.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.740
If they got hurt at all,
I'll pay for the doctor bills.

02:13.764 --> 02:15.242
No, not to worry.

02:15.266 --> 02:19.246
I got the feeling they were
sort of enjoying themselves.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.140
Really?

02:24.775 --> 02:27.394
What would you say to bringing
your boys over to my house

02:27.418 --> 02:29.556
and letting them hang out
with mine sometime?

02:29.580 --> 02:33.560
And that's how Lynette finally
got what she needed...

02:33.584 --> 02:35.262
Time for herself...

02:36.487 --> 02:39.636
And play dates for her kids...

02:39.660 --> 02:42.309
I'm sorry,

02:42.333 --> 02:45.780
but my boys decided to have
a rock fight with your boys.

02:45.804 --> 02:48.315
It was fun!

02:48.339 --> 02:51.218
Play dates she was determined
to keep...

02:51.242 --> 02:53.580
Well, they look fine to me.

02:53.604 --> 02:55.322
At all costs.

02:55.346 --> 02:57.324
Same time next week?

02:57.348 --> 02:58.708
Okay.

03:05.256 --> 03:09.696
Cameras are simple tools
designed to capture images...

03:09.720 --> 03:14.541
Images that tell us more about
ourselves than we realize.

03:14.565 --> 03:18.405
They remind us of
the long journey we've taken,

03:18.429 --> 03:22.279
the loved ones who
traveled alongside us...

03:22.303 --> 03:25.812
Those we lost along the way...

03:25.836 --> 03:29.886
And those waiting for us
on the road ahead.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.518
Okay.

03:31.542 --> 03:34.596
How am I supposed to eat with
a uterus staring me in the face?

03:34.620 --> 03:36.593
Oh, Gaby, I didn't know
you got a sonogram.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.725
Let me see. Oh.

03:38.749 --> 03:40.527
Honey, you need to put that
in a frame or something.

03:40.551 --> 03:43.230
I don't think so.

03:43.254 --> 03:45.237
Oh, come on.
That's a picture of your baby.

03:45.261 --> 03:47.604
You can't tell me you're not
a little bit excited.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.307
Fine. I'm pregnant. Whee!

03:50.331 --> 03:54.611
Now come on. We're supposed
to be cheering up Susan.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.243
This is a time of crisis,

03:56.267 --> 04:00.287
and I think you need another
scoop of mint chocolate chip. Thanks.

04:00.311 --> 04:02.289
Susan, why are you
so eerily calm?

04:02.313 --> 04:04.391
Mike Delfino just dumped you.

04:04.415 --> 04:08.395
The Susan Mayer I know would be
a blubbering mess right now.

04:08.419 --> 04:11.498
Oh, come on. Trot her on out.
She's fun to watch.

04:11.522 --> 04:13.800
Actually, I think I'm starting
to feel pretty zen

04:13.824 --> 04:15.807
about the whole thing.
Well, I think Mike

04:15.831 --> 04:18.635
will calm down in a couple
of days and come to his senses.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.338
No. I came between the man
and his son.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.839
It was a huge betrayal.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.277
I can't even blame him
for hating me.

04:25.301 --> 04:27.314
But Zach was starting to
obsess with Julie again.

04:27.338 --> 04:29.816
Exactly. You're a mother
trying to protect her child.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.548
It's a natural impulse.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.550
Over the past couple of days,

04:33.574 --> 04:36.261
I gave myself a long, hard look
in the mirror,

04:36.285 --> 04:38.385
and I did not like what I saw.

04:38.409 --> 04:41.358
I'm with you. Carry on.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.539
I just think if I start acting
like an adult for once,

04:44.563 --> 04:46.032
maybe... who knows?

04:46.056 --> 04:47.534
Somewhere down the line,

04:47.558 --> 04:49.596
Mike and I at least
can be friends.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.738
All right, you're not zen.

04:51.762 --> 04:53.340
You're numb.

04:53.364 --> 04:55.942
I'm fine.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.944
Do you got any pie?

04:57.968 --> 05:00.607
Not unless we make some.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.801
I can wait.

05:05.476 --> 05:07.484
Whoa.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.956
So if you need us,
we'll be at home,

05:09.980 --> 05:12.919
just having a quiet evening.

05:15.346 --> 05:17.824
Funny. We're expecting
quite the opposite.

05:17.848 --> 05:20.327
Well, don't forget,
next week it's our turn.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.529
We'll be taking Porter and...
Preston.

05:22.553 --> 05:24.531
Preston off your hands
all weekend.

05:24.555 --> 05:26.302
Rest assured,
we have not forgotten. See ya.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.404
Bye.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.028
Don't worry.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.409
Whoa, guys.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.986
Whoa, why aren't you upstairs
with p.J. And Jimmy?

05:35.010 --> 05:38.715
They're watching this dumb
video they brought. It's boring.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.388
Well, you should be polite
and watch it, too.

05:41.412 --> 05:43.790
You know, they're your guests.

05:43.814 --> 05:45.524
Guys.

05:48.419 --> 05:51.398
Hey, guys, we have snacks.

05:51.422 --> 05:54.501
Fix the light,
then we're good to go.

05:54.525 --> 05:55.662
Okay, ready?

05:55.686 --> 05:57.434
Okay.
All right, hang on now.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.607
Guys, whatisthis?

06:00.631 --> 06:01.668
A movie.

06:01.692 --> 06:04.411
Mommy and daddy made it.

06:04.435 --> 06:05.442
Peekaboo.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.743
Whoa. What's under there?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.475
Peekaboo. Peekaboo.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.478
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Where's the "off" button?

06:11.502 --> 06:14.080
It's underneath the panel thing.

06:14.104 --> 06:17.891
Well, it's stuck, it's stuck.
Get the remote. Get the remote.

06:17.915 --> 06:19.656
What's wrong?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.588
Oh!

06:21.612 --> 06:23.590
I found it.

06:25.115 --> 06:27.685
Oh. Ahem.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.059
So can we have the cocoa now?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.096
Well, what do you think?

06:40.431 --> 06:43.109
It is glorious.
I have to have it.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.557
I'm not sure you deserve
Dolce & Gabbana.

06:45.581 --> 06:47.554
Vern. You never
call. You never write.

06:47.578 --> 06:49.556
I know I haven't been
in the store lately,

06:49.580 --> 06:52.388
but I've been a little busy
getting my husband out of jail.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.521
That is such
a white trash thing to say.

06:54.545 --> 06:56.523
Luckily, the judge dropped
the hate crime charge,

06:56.547 --> 06:59.966
so now all Carlos has to do is
serve out the slave labor thing.

06:59.990 --> 07:02.028
He'll be out in six months.
If he's still in the hoosegow,

07:02.052 --> 07:04.030
why do you need
a fancy party dress?

07:04.054 --> 07:05.707
Because some of my model friends

07:05.731 --> 07:07.704
are coming down
from New York on Friday,

07:07.728 --> 07:10.437
so I have to look better
than ever.

07:10.461 --> 07:11.908
I can't have 'em thinking
I moved to the suburbs

07:11.932 --> 07:13.910
and now I shop at strip malls.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.417
But when they see this dress,
they will crumple to the floor

07:16.441 --> 07:18.414
like the botoxed hags they are.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.947
Good.
You know, it's a little snug.

07:20.971 --> 07:23.750
Yeah, I see that. I have
the same thing in a zero.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.421
Why not go up a size?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.193
Because I wear double zero,
you twerp.

07:27.217 --> 07:30.697
Why you getting snippy?
Because you just called me fat.

07:30.721 --> 07:33.500
Honey, you're pregnant.
Your body's changing.

07:33.524 --> 07:35.507
But I'm only
three months pregnant.

07:35.531 --> 07:37.504
Women don't show
at three months.

07:37.528 --> 07:39.005
Some women do.

07:39.029 --> 07:42.609
Do you want the larger size
or not?

07:42.633 --> 07:44.620
I'm just not gonna eat
for two days.

07:45.936 --> 07:49.066
Okay, you totally deserve
to wear Dolce & Gabbana.

07:51.502 --> 07:53.750
I want an explanation, Karl.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.451
Do you hear me?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.454
Edie, you just better
get the hell off my back,

07:58.478 --> 08:01.588
so help me. Oh, what are you
gonna do? I'd like to hear this.

08:01.612 --> 08:03.590
The big man
with the big threats.

08:03.614 --> 08:06.024
Back off.
Just back the hell off.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.498
Hi.

08:11.522 --> 08:14.676
Okay, so I got the box of
things you left on my porch.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.173
Yeah, I figured you'd want
your stuff back.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.675
Thanks. That's great,

08:18.699 --> 08:21.948
'cause if you decided to hang on
to my joni Mitchell cds,

08:21.972 --> 08:24.919
I would have had to come
after you with a club.

08:26.176 --> 08:28.885
You're right. It's not funny.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.888
Actually, I did want to just
see if you were aware

08:31.912 --> 08:34.929
that you gave me back
the Valentine's day card

08:34.953 --> 08:36.623
I made you.

08:36.647 --> 08:37.994
I was aware, yeah.

08:38.018 --> 08:42.529
Oh. Well, I mean,
when two people split up,

08:42.553 --> 08:46.072
normally they don't give
things back

08:46.096 --> 08:48.004
like Valentine's day cards.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.506
If you don't want it,
you can throw it away.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.279
Just please don't give it
back to me. It's tacky.

08:53.303 --> 08:54.681
I'm sorry.

08:54.705 --> 08:58.885
That's okay.
People make... mistakes.

08:58.909 --> 09:00.947
Anything else?

09:00.971 --> 09:05.251
Look, are you sure
this is what you want to do?

09:05.275 --> 09:06.753
I mean, I understand

09:06.777 --> 09:09.255
that you don't want
our relationship to continue.

09:09.279 --> 09:11.928
You have made that clear,
but I sort of thought

09:11.952 --> 09:13.760
down the long corridors of time,

09:13.784 --> 09:15.807
maybe you and I
could be friends,

09:15.831 --> 09:17.804
and if you keep acting
like this...

09:17.828 --> 09:19.806
Susan, it's over
on every level, okay?

09:19.830 --> 09:23.710
I've moved on.
You should do the same.

09:23.734 --> 09:25.681
Miserable son of a bitch!

09:25.705 --> 09:28.314
If I have secrets,

09:28.338 --> 09:31.838
I'm a hell of a lot better
at keeping them than you are!

09:33.744 --> 09:36.231
Well,
I'll say one thing for us.

09:36.255 --> 09:38.224
Even with all our problems,

09:38.248 --> 09:40.748
at least we're not
acting like that.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.694
Okay, I'm starting
to get the feeling

09:47.718 --> 09:49.696
that we're not going
to a yard sale.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.739
That was just a clever ruse
to get you into my car.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.750
Are you ready for your surprise?

09:54.774 --> 09:55.825
Mm-hmm.

09:57.768 --> 10:00.306
Oh.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.308
George, this is just
an empty house.

10:02.332 --> 10:04.310
Why is this a surprise?

10:04.334 --> 10:06.713
I just bought it.

10:06.737 --> 10:09.916
Oh, my god! Congratulations.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.719
Oh, George, I didn't even know
you were looking.

10:12.743 --> 10:14.661
Hurry, ceal. They're here!

10:14.685 --> 10:17.363
I'm coming. Hey, Georgie.

10:17.387 --> 10:19.666
Bree, I'd like you
to meet my mother.

10:19.690 --> 10:21.668
George never introduces me
to anyone.

10:21.692 --> 10:24.771
So I knew you were special.

10:24.795 --> 10:26.773
And this is ceal,
my mother's friend,

10:26.797 --> 10:29.275
and the real estate agent
who sold me the house.

10:29.299 --> 10:30.707
Hi.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.208
Hi.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.210
Well, we're gonna go in the back

10:34.234 --> 10:36.783
so George can, you know...

10:42.272 --> 10:44.220
So...

10:44.244 --> 10:46.092
Do you really like it?

10:46.116 --> 10:48.354
I do. I really do.

10:48.378 --> 10:50.356
Good,
'cause I was sort of hoping

10:50.380 --> 10:54.220
that you might like
to live here.

10:56.757 --> 11:00.737
Bree...

11:00.761 --> 11:02.691
Will you marry me?

11:05.095 --> 11:06.312
Huh?

11:06.336 --> 11:07.814
I love you,

11:07.838 --> 11:11.047
and I think I know how you
feel about me, so why wait?

11:11.071 --> 11:15.281
George, Rex hasn't even been
dead for two months.

11:15.305 --> 11:17.784
Yes, but if his death
has taught us anything,

11:17.808 --> 11:21.157
it's that life is short.
It's dumb to play it safe.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.029
If we see a chance
for happiness,

11:23.053 --> 11:25.692
we should grab it
and hold on tight.

11:25.716 --> 11:29.195
See, I thought we were
going to a yard sale.

11:29.219 --> 11:32.198
Please. Just say the word,

11:32.222 --> 11:34.879
and you'll make me
the happiest guy on earth.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.345
Congratulations, you two.

11:39.369 --> 11:40.877
Mazel tov.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.711
Guys, wait.
She hasn't said yes yet.

11:44.735 --> 11:45.912
Oh.

11:45.936 --> 11:48.236
I told you we should wait.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.019
Um... so, uh, Bree...

11:53.043 --> 11:55.862
What do you say?

11:55.886 --> 11:59.186
See, George, um, the thing is...

12:09.930 --> 12:11.177
Okay.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.079
You will?

12:13.103 --> 12:14.781
You'll marry me?

12:14.805 --> 12:16.235
Okay.

12:19.209 --> 12:20.186
Oh!

12:23.373 --> 12:25.351
Oh, my baby!

12:41.491 --> 12:42.969
Who is it?

12:42.993 --> 12:45.842
It's your ex-husband.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.214
Oh. Karl.

12:48.238 --> 12:50.817
What do you want?

12:50.841 --> 12:52.779
Edie and I just broke up.

12:52.803 --> 12:56.483
Oh. Well, come on in.

13:01.111 --> 13:03.259
Sorry to come over
on such short notice,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.336
but I couldn't face
going to a motel.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.794
That's okay. Julie's staying
at a friend's tonight.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.095
You can sleep in her room.

13:09.119 --> 13:11.938
Well, the sofa's fine,
but thanks.

13:11.962 --> 13:16.472
So am I allowed to ask
what happened?

13:16.496 --> 13:18.945
You could ask, but I won't tell.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.547
Why not?
'Cause it's embarrassing.

13:21.571 --> 13:23.810
Karl, did you cheat again?

13:23.834 --> 13:24.911
No.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.113
Did she cheat? No.

13:27.137 --> 13:28.784
You finally saw her
without her makeup.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.886
Susan...

13:29.910 --> 13:31.217
I'm sorry.

13:31.241 --> 13:34.460
Are you okay?

13:34.484 --> 13:38.294
Yeah. It hadn't been working
for quite a while.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.166
This was inevitable.

13:40.190 --> 13:41.968
Well, these days,

13:41.992 --> 13:44.836
anybody going through
a breakup gets my sympathy.

13:44.860 --> 13:47.874
That's right. I heard
you made the plumber angry.

13:47.898 --> 13:49.876
No, I made the plumber furious,

13:49.900 --> 13:53.460
and it's definitely over.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.844
So there will be
no gloating from me.

13:57.868 --> 14:00.146
Well, here's to no gloating.

14:02.873 --> 14:05.360
Mm. Actually, I'm trying
to keep a positive outlook

14:05.384 --> 14:06.853
on the whole thing.

14:06.877 --> 14:08.855
Um, last night,
I started writing,

14:08.879 --> 14:11.928
and, well, I think
there's a book in there.

14:11.952 --> 14:12.929
A book? Yeah.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.400
Like one
of your children's books?

14:14.424 --> 14:16.402
No. This one's for adults,

14:16.426 --> 14:18.905
about all
my failed relationships.

14:18.929 --> 14:20.536
You're not writing
about me, are you?

14:20.560 --> 14:22.838
You're like
the first 14 chapters.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.341
Are you gonna be fair?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.043
I'm gonna be honest.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.075
I was afraid of that.

14:31.101 --> 14:33.419
It was just awful.

14:33.443 --> 14:34.921
George had a ring.

14:34.945 --> 14:37.423
His mother and her friend
were there with champagne.

14:37.447 --> 14:40.586
If I had said "no,"
it would have devastated him.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.930
So you agreed to marry him
just to be polite?

14:43.954 --> 14:45.031
Well, obviously,

14:45.055 --> 14:47.934
there's a downside
to having good manners.

14:47.958 --> 14:51.037
So when will you tell him
how you really feel?

14:51.061 --> 14:53.039
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

14:53.063 --> 14:55.210
I mean, part of me
keeps thinking

14:55.234 --> 14:57.203
maybe I should just do it.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.645
Do it?
You mean actually marry him?

14:59.669 --> 15:01.908
Well, I know it sounds rash,

15:01.932 --> 15:04.280
but, well, there's something
comfortable about George.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.918
We share the same tastes
and interests.

15:06.942 --> 15:09.655
Oh, and best of all,
he loves the opera.

15:09.679 --> 15:10.917
The opera?

15:10.941 --> 15:12.919
Yes, we saw "aida" last week,

15:12.943 --> 15:14.921
and we both cried buckets.

15:14.945 --> 15:16.222
It was fun.

15:16.246 --> 15:19.895
George loves art,
poetry and music.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.128
It would be nice
to be married to someone

15:22.152 --> 15:25.202
who looks for beauty
in the world like I do.

15:31.561 --> 15:33.539
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

15:33.563 --> 15:36.312
I don't know what to do,
Dr. Goldfine.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.314
Bree, you've said many times

15:38.338 --> 15:40.646
how comfortable you are
with George,

15:40.670 --> 15:44.050
but you don't feel for him
the way you felt for Rex.

15:44.074 --> 15:46.354
No.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.229
True love is great.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.932
But at this point in my life,

15:56.956 --> 16:00.956
I think I'd rather
just go to the opera.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.320
Give me your glass.
Oh, no, no, wait.

16:05.344 --> 16:07.313
We gotta finish off this.

16:07.337 --> 16:09.976
No way, no way, no way.
Four glasses is my limit.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.978
If you help me finish off
this bottle,

16:12.002 --> 16:14.350
I'll tell you what happened
between me and Edie.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.621
Hit me.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.132
Edie was making the bed

16:26.156 --> 16:29.665
and found a picture
I kept under the mattress...

16:29.689 --> 16:33.599
A picture I didn't want her
to see.

16:33.623 --> 16:35.303
What was it?

16:37.027 --> 16:39.027
It was a picture of you.

16:40.470 --> 16:42.148
Why would you...

16:42.172 --> 16:44.680
Because it's something
I like to take a look at

16:44.704 --> 16:46.682
every now and then.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.636
Wow.

16:57.587 --> 17:00.426
What the hell was that?
That was something

17:00.450 --> 17:02.628
I've been wanting to do
for quite some time.

17:02.652 --> 17:05.731
Oh, that's just you
rebounding from Edie.

17:05.755 --> 17:08.233
So you're on the rebound
from the plumber.

17:08.258 --> 17:10.276
No harm, no foul.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.579
Karl, it would be so weird.

17:13.603 --> 17:16.446
We're two old friends who
suddenly find themselves single.

17:16.471 --> 17:18.513
There's nothing weird about us

17:18.538 --> 17:22.288
helping each other out to be...

17:22.311 --> 17:24.112
A little less lonely.

17:27.817 --> 17:29.795
Thanks so much
for taking care of the boys.

17:29.819 --> 17:32.128
I'll be back on Friday
to pick your guys up.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.630
Leonard and I are gonna
take them all to the water park.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.637
Yeah, um, before that happens...

17:36.661 --> 17:39.635
And we're gonna be able to take
penny soon, aren't we?

17:39.659 --> 17:44.170
She's getting so big.

17:44.194 --> 17:46.142
Peekaboo.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.714
Peekaboo. Peekaboo.

17:48.738 --> 17:51.147
Yeah, okay, enough of that.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.319
Is there something wrong?

17:53.343 --> 17:54.480
Actually, yes.

17:54.504 --> 17:57.191
We've agonized whether
to tell you this, Norma,

17:57.215 --> 18:01.557
but one of your...
Private videos

18:01.581 --> 18:04.611
made its way into
Jimmy and p.J.'S bag.

18:11.561 --> 18:15.241
Please... tell me
the kids didn't see it.

18:15.265 --> 18:17.543
Oh, no, don't worry.
I caught it, I caught it...

18:17.567 --> 18:20.506
Right before
you took off your bra.

18:20.530 --> 18:23.078
I have to go.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.550
Oh, Norma. It's okay.

18:24.574 --> 18:27.221
We just thought you needed
to know what happened.

18:27.245 --> 18:29.255
Seriously, we're cool with it

18:29.279 --> 18:32.388
so long as you keep it away from the
kids. I told Leonard this was gonna happen!

18:32.412 --> 18:37.323
Jimmy, p.J., close the door!
Are we all buckled up?!

18:37.347 --> 18:39.225
Norma, wait!

18:39.249 --> 18:42.128
We're still on for next week!

18:42.152 --> 18:45.100
Norma! The water park!

18:45.124 --> 18:46.502
Right?

19:00.170 --> 19:01.910
Mom!

19:06.776 --> 19:08.476
Mom?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.857
Mom, are you up?

19:11.881 --> 19:14.129
Mom...

19:14.153 --> 19:16.602
Oh, my god.

19:16.626 --> 19:21.136
Oh. Julie! I thought you were
going straight to school.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.708
I-I needed money for lunch.

19:22.732 --> 19:25.249
There's a $20 in my pants...
If you can find 'em.

19:25.273 --> 19:27.473
Oh, uh, Julie, uh...

19:27.497 --> 19:29.267
Oh, Julie, uh... Honey.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.260
Okay, there is a good
explanation for what happened.

19:36.284 --> 19:37.753
I doubt that.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.756
You probably don't know
that your father and Edie

19:40.780 --> 19:42.428
broke up last night.

19:42.452 --> 19:45.160
You slept with him the same
night he broke up with her.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.941
Well, I said it was a good
explanation, not a great one.

19:49.259 --> 19:50.296
Oh, Julie.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.397
Hey, pumpkin.

19:51.421 --> 19:52.868
Don't even.

19:52.892 --> 19:56.842
Oh, now I feel
really awful.

19:56.866 --> 19:58.173
Me too.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.207
We should not have done
what we did.

20:01.231 --> 20:03.301
I know, I know.

20:06.236 --> 20:08.214
But I gotta tell you,

20:08.238 --> 20:09.915
last night
was the best sex ever.

20:09.939 --> 20:11.917
Wasn't it, though?
You were fantastic.

20:11.941 --> 20:14.941
Hey, I was just trying
to keep up withyou.

20:16.346 --> 20:19.325
Why do you think we got
so good all of a sudden?

20:19.349 --> 20:22.268
Because we've been angry
at each other for so long,

20:22.292 --> 20:25.671
and we finally found
a way to channel it.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.455
Maybe.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.306
So what happens next?

20:30.330 --> 20:32.308
Well, I'm gonna take a shower.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.939
No, I-I mean with us.

20:33.963 --> 20:35.786
Us? What do you mean?
There's no us.

20:35.810 --> 20:38.344
You can't tell me
you can just walk away

20:38.368 --> 20:40.346
from this chemistry
we got goin'.

20:40.370 --> 20:43.449
I mean, what happened
last night was...

20:43.473 --> 20:45.251
Whew. Explosive.

20:45.275 --> 20:46.992
Karl, last night was
two old friends

20:47.016 --> 20:49.495
helping each other through
a rough patch. That's it.

20:49.519 --> 20:51.257
Susie q...

20:51.281 --> 20:54.330
Karl, I want to move on.
I don't want to go backwards.

20:54.354 --> 20:57.271
I'm sorry. Mwah! But thank you
for the explosion.

20:57.295 --> 20:58.827
I really needed it.

21:05.295 --> 21:08.274
After 48 hours of crash dieting,

21:08.298 --> 21:12.578
Gabrielle prepared to savor
the fruit of her labor.

21:12.602 --> 21:16.021
But she was dismayed
to discover that she herself

21:16.045 --> 21:18.554
had ripened considerably.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.549
Ohh!

21:27.016 --> 21:28.994
Ralph!

21:29.018 --> 21:31.018
I need help getting dressed.
Get in here!

21:34.293 --> 21:35.573
Now!

21:38.628 --> 21:40.806
I have to fit in this,
so for god's sakes,

21:40.830 --> 21:43.008
put some muscle into it.

21:43.032 --> 21:44.550
I'm trying.

21:44.574 --> 21:46.051
It won't zip.

21:46.075 --> 21:47.613
Well, try harder.

21:47.637 --> 21:49.955
Ohh! Ow. My hands hurt.

21:49.979 --> 21:52.958
I'm sorry, Ms. Solis, but I
can't get you into this dress.

21:52.982 --> 21:54.460
It's just too small.

21:54.484 --> 21:56.291
Get me into this dress,

21:56.315 --> 21:58.385
and I will pay you
$10 more a week.

22:00.850 --> 22:04.570
I think I got it. Hold on.
Hold still. Here we go.

22:04.594 --> 22:06.672
One...

22:06.696 --> 22:08.033
Two...

22:08.057 --> 22:09.835
Three. There.

22:09.859 --> 22:12.378
Ohh! Thank god.

22:24.374 --> 22:26.424
We brought you some ice cream.

22:28.077 --> 22:31.347
I know how long it's been
since you had any.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.441
We'll have that in a minute,
sweetheart.

22:37.465 --> 22:42.568
First, I want you to talk to me

22:42.592 --> 22:44.710
about what happened...

22:44.734 --> 22:45.941
About Melanie.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.943
I don't want to talk about her.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.116
You know it breaks my heart
to keep you down here like this.

22:51.140 --> 22:54.780
But I can't let you out
until I am positive

22:54.804 --> 22:57.131
that you will never
hurt anyone else again.

22:57.155 --> 22:59.555
And the first step

22:59.579 --> 23:02.027
is for you to show me
that you understand

23:02.051 --> 23:04.359
that what you did was wrong.

23:04.383 --> 23:09.094
She was a bad person.

23:09.118 --> 23:11.366
She deserved it.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.160
No one deserves
to die like that, Caleb.

23:17.026 --> 23:18.866
Don't you agree?

23:28.878 --> 23:30.478
Very well.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.592
If that's how
it's going to be...

23:36.616 --> 23:40.416
This is how it's going to be.

24:17.186 --> 24:19.204
I can't believe
we're doing this.

24:19.228 --> 24:22.207
If Leonard and Norma
want to cut ties with us,

24:22.231 --> 24:24.209
who are we to stop them?

24:24.233 --> 24:26.216
They need to know
we don't judge them

24:26.240 --> 24:29.214
for what they do in the privacy
of their own home.

24:29.238 --> 24:31.917
And, well, it's not unheard of
to tape yourself

24:31.941 --> 24:33.218
while you're having sex.

24:33.242 --> 24:35.220
Well, obviously,
there were so embarrassed,

24:35.244 --> 24:37.227
they don't want anything
to do with us.

24:37.251 --> 24:39.224
Maybe we need to respect that.

24:39.248 --> 24:41.226
I need these play dates.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.228
Tom, weneed these play dates.

24:43.252 --> 24:46.732
Fine. Fine.
But you do all the talking.

24:46.756 --> 24:48.564
Okay.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.565
Norma...

24:49.589 --> 24:50.696
Aah!

24:50.720 --> 24:52.498
Wait!

24:52.522 --> 24:53.699
Let's go.

24:53.723 --> 24:55.200
No!

24:55.224 --> 24:59.074
Hey, scavos.
What are you guys doing here?

24:59.098 --> 25:01.877
Hi. Sorry for just
showing up unannounced,

25:01.901 --> 25:04.910
but, um, could we
talk to you for a minute?

25:04.934 --> 25:06.211
Sure, come on in.

25:06.235 --> 25:08.954
So, um,

25:08.978 --> 25:10.816
we've been trying
to contact you,

25:10.840 --> 25:13.819
but you haven't been returning
any of our messages.

25:13.843 --> 25:16.830
And we really hope it isn't
because of the porno video.

25:16.854 --> 25:18.524
Home... home movies.

25:18.548 --> 25:20.265
The fact is,
we really don't care,

25:20.289 --> 25:23.769
and it's certainly no reason
to keep our boys apart.

25:23.793 --> 25:26.832
We just don't know
how they found it.

25:26.856 --> 25:28.834
But you know boys...
They get into everything,

25:28.858 --> 25:30.836
but seriously,
it's not a big deal.

25:30.860 --> 25:33.839
I mean, just as long as you make
sure it never happens again.

25:33.863 --> 25:35.240
It's the new millennium.
We're... we're hip.

25:35.264 --> 25:38.183
You know, what we're saying is,
we get it.

25:38.207 --> 25:42.287
You're just having fun.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

25:42.311 --> 25:44.590
I'm just so relieved
this all worked out.

25:44.614 --> 25:46.597
At one point we actually talked

25:46.621 --> 25:48.594
about selling the house
and moving.

25:48.618 --> 25:51.797
Oh, no!

25:51.821 --> 25:54.299
Thank you for being
so open-minded.

25:54.323 --> 25:58.533
Please, we're all adults.
It's...

25:58.557 --> 26:00.035
I gotta tell you,

26:00.059 --> 26:02.037
the most embarrassing part
of that video

26:02.061 --> 26:04.039
is how poorly it was shot.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.050
The production values are ca-ca.

26:06.074 --> 26:10.045
Well, from a lay perspective,
it looked very professional.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.849
What you saw was an example
of my earlier work.

26:13.873 --> 26:17.230
Since then I've become much
more adept at... production.

26:17.254 --> 26:18.784
Ah.

26:18.808 --> 26:20.886
You know, editing and lighting.

26:20.910 --> 26:24.059
Leonard has always dreamed
of directing movies.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.061
Ironic, isn't it?

26:26.085 --> 26:27.893
I finally get my wish,

26:27.917 --> 26:30.596
and no one ever gets
to see my work.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.760
That is a damn shame.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.703
Norma, what do you think?
Should we show them the room?

26:39.368 --> 26:43.068
Let's show 'em the room. Huh?

26:46.075 --> 26:48.614
Check out this baby.
3-chip high-def,

26:48.638 --> 26:51.657
1280x720 lines of resolution,
bounced lighting,

26:51.681 --> 26:54.660
and dark sheets so you don't
get a kick off the pillows.

26:54.684 --> 26:57.628
Took me a while to learn
that little trick, huh?

26:57.652 --> 26:59.695
These walls are
completely soundproof.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.997
You could scream
your lungs out in here,

27:02.021 --> 27:03.799
and nobody'd hear you.
It's true.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.605
So... anytime you wanna set up
a shoot, just let me know.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.237
You guys would love it.

27:12.261 --> 27:14.609
Once you get in front
of that camera,

27:14.633 --> 27:16.643
you feel like a star.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.386
Good night.

27:21.410 --> 27:22.718
Night.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.720
Night. I'm thinking
no more play dates.

27:24.744 --> 27:27.024
Not a one.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.358
Hey. We'd better hurry.
The movie starts in 20 minutes.

27:33.382 --> 27:35.360
There's been a slight change
of plans.

27:35.384 --> 27:37.067
My mother had
a couple of friends

27:37.091 --> 27:38.904
who really wanted to meet you,

27:38.928 --> 27:41.907
and I thought, "what the heck?
It could be fun." Do you mind?

27:41.931 --> 27:44.339
Uh, no, I-I guess not.

27:44.363 --> 27:48.013
Hey, everybody, this is Bree.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.351
And this is my uncle sid. Hi.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.923
My aunt Rosalie.

27:57.947 --> 27:59.424
Hello.

27:59.448 --> 28:02.327
Oh, and this is Stan grazi,
who does my mom's taxes.

28:02.351 --> 28:04.159
She's a knockout, George.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.091
Guess I owe you an apology.

28:06.115 --> 28:08.093
Since I was single
all these years,

28:08.117 --> 28:10.836
Stan kept telling my mom
I was gay.

28:10.860 --> 28:13.098
I'm still gonna need some proof.

28:13.122 --> 28:14.439
But I guess I'll be getting that

28:14.463 --> 28:16.441
in about nine months, hey, Bree?

28:16.465 --> 28:18.443
What happens in nine months?
That's just Stan's little joke

28:18.467 --> 28:21.146
about when we're gonna
start our own family.

28:21.170 --> 28:22.447
Now just so you know, Stan,

28:22.471 --> 28:24.880
it's gonna be a while before
we even think about kids.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.813
I want Bree all to myself
for a while.

28:27.837 --> 28:29.815
Well, don't wanna wait too long.

28:29.839 --> 28:32.117
After 40, the eggs
don't get any fresher.

28:32.141 --> 28:33.418
Am I right, Bree?

28:36.715 --> 28:40.285
If you'll excuse me,
I, uh, I have to go.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.206
Bree, Bree, where are you going?

28:46.230 --> 28:48.703
I am taking my champagne
and my aging eggs,

28:48.727 --> 28:50.475
and I'm going home.
What's wrong?

28:50.499 --> 28:52.477
George,
I'm starting to think

28:52.501 --> 28:56.381
that we made a mistake
rushing into this engagement.

28:56.405 --> 28:59.714
What? And I'm not the
only one who thinks that.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.487
Other people have said the
same thing. What others? Andrew?

29:02.511 --> 29:04.249
No. Dr. Goldfine, my therapist.

29:04.273 --> 29:06.456
Your therapist?
He doesn't know me.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.795
Well, he knows me, and certainly
better than you do.

29:09.819 --> 29:11.096
How can you say that?

29:11.120 --> 29:12.998
Well, for starters,
he knows the last thing

29:13.022 --> 29:16.001
I'd ever want to do
is have more children.

29:16.025 --> 29:18.003
Really? Well, I didn't know.

29:18.027 --> 29:20.005
But youshouldknow that.

29:20.029 --> 29:22.938
That's the kind of thing
that people who are engaged

29:22.962 --> 29:24.940
are supposed to know
about each other.

29:24.964 --> 29:27.081
Well, it doesn't matter.
I don't need children.

29:27.105 --> 29:29.074
It's not just that, George.

29:29.098 --> 29:32.077
Dr. Goldfine has other concerns
about us being together,

29:32.101 --> 29:34.419
and I'm starting
to think he's right.

29:34.443 --> 29:38.053
Look...

29:38.077 --> 29:40.485
I'll agree with Dr. Goldfine
on one thing.

29:40.509 --> 29:42.928
We should slow things down.

29:42.952 --> 29:44.259
Really?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.366
Yes. Just because
two people are engaged

29:46.390 --> 29:48.794
doesn't mean they have to
get married anytime soon.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.000
I'll talk to Dr. Goldfine
about it tomorrow.

29:55.024 --> 29:57.002
Take whatever time you need.

30:13.012 --> 30:16.366
How many times am I gonna have
to ask you to fix this step?

30:16.390 --> 30:18.363
Matthew, are you
going to answer me?

30:18.387 --> 30:20.287
Did you leave the door open?

30:52.882 --> 30:54.159
How'd you do?

30:54.183 --> 30:55.400
Not good.

30:55.424 --> 30:58.411
People are gonna start
coming home from work soon.

30:58.435 --> 31:02.207
Okay. We can't panic.
Caleb is scared.

31:02.231 --> 31:06.141
He doesn't know the area,
so he's got to be close by.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.195
Which yards
haven't you checked yet?

31:17.947 --> 31:21.256
Bree, I desperately need
your help.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.858
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

31:23.882 --> 31:26.866
How do you get your hydrangeas
to look so stunning?

31:26.890 --> 31:29.634
I'm systematically
slaughtering my own garden.

31:29.658 --> 31:32.167
Do you really want to know
my secret?

31:32.191 --> 31:33.198
Oh, yes.

31:33.222 --> 31:35.200
Horse manure.
I have it delivered.

31:35.224 --> 31:38.574
Susan makes fun of me,
but the proof is in the pudding.

31:53.142 --> 31:54.559
Hello.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.653
Hey.

32:00.489 --> 32:02.397
Looking for something?

32:02.421 --> 32:07.372
Ahem. Uh... yeah.
Actually, I'm looking for you.

32:07.396 --> 32:09.975
Me?

32:09.999 --> 32:11.576
You're looking for me?

32:11.600 --> 32:13.408
Yeah. I've been
thinking about you,

32:13.432 --> 32:16.419
and that time we met,
I thought you were really cool.

32:16.443 --> 32:19.065
So you came to ask me out?

32:25.644 --> 32:28.624
'Cause I'll say yes.

32:34.123 --> 32:36.593
Thank you.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.109
Anything?

32:44.133 --> 32:48.043
Well, that was
a waste of time.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.475
Pretty much.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.579
Did you hear the big news?

32:54.603 --> 32:56.681
Uh, the big news?

32:56.705 --> 33:00.055
Karl and I are back together.
What?

33:00.079 --> 33:02.988
And I know that he stayed
at your place last night,

33:03.012 --> 33:05.360
which leads me to why I'm here.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.737
There's some stuff
that I have to say,

33:07.761 --> 33:09.734
and it's not
going to be pleasant.

33:09.758 --> 33:11.096
Edie, uh...

33:11.120 --> 33:14.339
Whatever it was that you said
to him really helped.

33:14.363 --> 33:16.241
He showed up with flowers

33:16.265 --> 33:18.603
and he apologized
for everything.

33:18.627 --> 33:21.367
So...

33:23.702 --> 33:25.050
Thank you.

33:25.074 --> 33:27.712
I'm sorry, what?

33:27.736 --> 33:29.714
Well, I'm not
gonna say it again.

33:29.738 --> 33:32.057
It hurt my teeth the first time.

33:32.081 --> 33:34.689
No, Edie. This is so unexpected
on so many levels.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.730
I don't know what to say.
Then say nothing.

33:36.754 --> 33:40.065
Oh, and, uh, here...

33:40.089 --> 33:42.527
Is the photo of you
I found in our bed.

33:42.551 --> 33:44.629
I know he told you about it.

33:44.653 --> 33:46.733
Why are you giving it to me?

33:48.397 --> 33:52.077
Look, I appreciate whatever
it was that you did last night,

33:52.101 --> 33:54.579
but it's still important
for you to understand

33:54.603 --> 33:56.311
that... I won.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.514
You won?

33:59.538 --> 34:02.016
Yeah. Whatever little hold
you had on Karl

34:02.040 --> 34:03.518
is officially over.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.790
So you can stop feeling all smug

34:05.814 --> 34:09.094
and superior
that he kept that... thing.

34:09.118 --> 34:11.496
Believe me,
I don't feel superior.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.797
Good, 'cause you shouldn't.

34:12.821 --> 34:16.161
He made his choice,
and it's not you.

34:16.185 --> 34:20.525
You're right.
He made his choice.

34:32.141 --> 34:34.119
No, Bree, it's still too easy
to breathe.

34:34.143 --> 34:36.121
You've gotta make it tighter.

34:36.145 --> 34:38.123
Gaby, if I make it any tighter,

34:38.147 --> 34:40.125
you won't be able to sit down.

34:40.149 --> 34:41.426
I don't care.

34:41.449 --> 34:44.129
I can't have these girls
thinking I'm pregnant.

34:44.152 --> 34:47.137
Gosh, do you actually think
they're gonna make fun of you?

34:47.161 --> 34:48.763
Trust me. They're merciless.

34:48.786 --> 34:52.397
But why? I mean, surely they
have friends who have children.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.399
When I decided to marry Carlos,

34:54.422 --> 34:57.407
I told these girls I would spend
the rest of my days

34:57.431 --> 34:59.474
being rich and in love
and childless,

34:59.498 --> 35:01.176
and they laughed at me,

35:01.200 --> 35:03.178
and they said
I would just end up being

35:03.202 --> 35:07.182
another fat hausfrau living
a life that I didn't plan.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.184
I'm not gonna give them
the satisfaction

35:09.208 --> 35:11.186
of knowing they were right.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.488
Well, maybe they'll just
be happy for you.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.499
Bree, my friends are models.
They're never happy for anyone.

35:16.523 --> 35:19.624
Do you ever think
you might like it?

35:19.648 --> 35:20.725
What?

35:20.749 --> 35:22.367
Motherhood. No.

35:22.391 --> 35:23.868
Oh, come on.

35:23.892 --> 35:26.836
You don't think you're
gonna love your own baby?

35:26.860 --> 35:29.334
Well, I'm not saying
I'm not gonna grow attached

35:29.358 --> 35:30.835
to the little bugger.

35:30.859 --> 35:32.837
I just don't have
the motherhood gene.

35:32.861 --> 35:34.839
I wish I did, but I don't.

35:34.863 --> 35:36.841
What?

35:36.865 --> 35:39.844
Well, I'm just smiling because
I think a few months from now

35:39.868 --> 35:41.686
you are gonna come to me

35:41.710 --> 35:44.189
and tell me
how madly in love you are

35:44.213 --> 35:45.890
with your new little baby,

35:45.914 --> 35:48.898
and I'm gonna have to resist
the urge to say "I told you so."

35:48.922 --> 35:50.655
Maybe, but I doubt it.
There you go.

35:50.679 --> 35:51.879
All done.

35:53.322 --> 35:56.231
Ah. How do I look?

35:56.255 --> 35:57.702
Positively glowing.

35:57.726 --> 35:59.926
Bree...

36:31.660 --> 36:34.639
Aah!

37:09.227 --> 37:11.205
Hi! Hello!

37:12.731 --> 37:14.231
Oh, my god!

37:15.704 --> 37:16.781
You're pregnant!

37:22.411 --> 37:24.649
Bree? It's Gaby!

37:24.673 --> 37:26.683
Honey, it's open. Come on in.

37:30.479 --> 37:35.260
Hi. My, uh, friends just left,

37:35.284 --> 37:37.962
and I was hoping
you could come over

37:37.986 --> 37:39.964
and cut me out of this thing.

37:39.988 --> 37:41.966
How was your little reunion?

37:41.990 --> 37:44.969
It was, um... weird.

37:44.993 --> 37:46.471
Weird?

37:46.495 --> 37:47.872
Well, Allison's mad

37:47.896 --> 37:50.745
because she's losing jobs
to 14-year-olds,

37:50.769 --> 37:53.678
Holly is on a strict diet
of cruciferous vegetables,

37:53.702 --> 37:58.353
and Yasmin is undergoing
a new embryonic facial treatment

37:58.377 --> 38:01.025
that probably causes
short-term memory loss.

38:01.049 --> 38:04.028
You know, I just stood there
the whole night

38:04.052 --> 38:07.992
trying to remember why
we were ever friends.

38:08.016 --> 38:09.494
And I couldn't.

38:09.518 --> 38:13.338
You know, honey, people change.

38:13.362 --> 38:15.640
Yeah, but that's the thing.
They haven't changed.

38:15.664 --> 38:18.303
That's who they've always been.

38:18.327 --> 38:22.407
I've changed, and I honestly
don't know how.

38:22.431 --> 38:24.008
Well...

38:24.032 --> 38:27.759
Maybe Susan, Lynette and I have
had a good influence on you.

38:27.783 --> 38:31.336
I doubt that.

38:32.881 --> 38:34.859
Come on. When I finish up here,

38:34.883 --> 38:37.462
I will come over
with my sewing kit

38:37.486 --> 38:39.524
and cut you out of that.

38:39.548 --> 38:41.526
All right, but hurry up,

38:41.550 --> 38:43.067
because I've been having to pee
since hors d'oeuvres.

38:48.397 --> 38:51.476
Are you free
to go shopping tomorrow?

38:51.500 --> 38:53.478
I figured it's probably time

38:53.502 --> 38:55.540
I bought some clothes
that actually fit.

38:55.564 --> 38:58.091
Well, I know a store that
carries maternity clothes

38:58.115 --> 39:00.084
with designer labels.

39:00.108 --> 39:03.648
I like the sound of that.

39:03.672 --> 39:05.542
Thanks.

39:50.689 --> 39:51.819
Aah!

40:38.937 --> 40:41.716
Thank you.

40:41.740 --> 40:47.051
Yes, cameras are tools
designed to capture images.

40:47.075 --> 40:48.953
Wait.

40:48.977 --> 40:51.425
What is it?

40:51.449 --> 40:53.898
Uh, she needs me to get
something for her.

40:53.922 --> 40:55.800
I will be right back.

40:55.824 --> 40:59.203
But in truth,
they can capture so much more.

40:59.227 --> 41:02.937
They can uncover hidden longing

41:02.961 --> 41:07.642
of men
who should no longer care.

41:07.666 --> 41:12.046
They can reveal
the extraordinary secrets

41:12.070 --> 41:16.721
of the most ordinary marriages.

41:16.745 --> 41:20.685
Most amazing of all,

41:20.709 --> 41:26.631
cameras can quietly and clearly
reveal to us our dreams...

41:26.655 --> 41:29.655
Dreams we didn't even know
we had.
