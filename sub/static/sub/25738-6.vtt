WEBVTT

00:02.597 --> 00:05.037
This programme contains some
strong language

00:06.077 --> 00:09.757
Would you do me the honour of
permitting me, Dale Ashbrick,

00:09.757 --> 00:11.157
to propose to your daughter?

00:11.157 --> 00:14.237
Should your focus be wedding rings
when you haven't got a job?

00:14.237 --> 00:18.277
You are looking at a 49% owner
of All Dale And Steve's Pals.

00:18.277 --> 00:19.917
Steve's already got the lease.

00:19.917 --> 00:21.117
Why do I feel scared?

00:21.117 --> 00:24.157
Rachel said she needed more space to
think about her path in life,

00:24.157 --> 00:27.397
so I found the place in England
with the most space there is!

00:27.397 --> 00:28.757
I needed time to think,

00:28.757 --> 00:31.957
not some kind of non-consensual
Duke of Edinburgh.

00:31.957 --> 00:33.477
A job's come up - a real one.

00:33.477 --> 00:34.917
Where is it?

00:34.917 --> 00:37.997
Erm, it's in
Sierra Nevada...or Leone.

00:37.997 --> 00:39.157
The African one.

00:49.957 --> 00:51.157
Oh, wow.

00:53.197 --> 00:57.037
Like, genuine question,
you built this? Just you and Steve?

00:57.037 --> 00:58.437
Well, it was mainly me.

00:58.437 --> 01:00.237
Steve preferred to supervise.

01:00.237 --> 01:02.117
He made me work
with my top off a lot.

01:02.117 --> 01:03.717
Sometimes my pants too.

01:03.717 --> 01:05.557
All right.

01:05.557 --> 01:07.797
DOOR OPENS
Ah...

01:07.797 --> 01:09.117
Wow.

01:09.117 --> 01:11.157
I actually meant
shove a coat of magnolia on it.

01:11.157 --> 01:12.597
Oh, I'm sorry. I can wash it off.

01:12.597 --> 01:15.357
No, no, no, no. No, leave it.

01:15.357 --> 01:16.557
It's beautiful.

01:17.597 --> 01:18.797
It's All Steve's Pals.

01:18.797 --> 01:20.677
I mean, look at this place, huh?

01:20.677 --> 01:22.477
And they said we'd never make it
happen.

01:22.477 --> 01:24.677
Who did? Ken, Lorna, Connie,

01:24.677 --> 01:26.357
the postman, my kids,

01:26.357 --> 01:28.797
BBC West Midlands,
your girlfriend...

01:28.797 --> 01:30.957
Yeah, to be fair, I did say that.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.117
Still, we showed them.

01:33.117 --> 01:36.677
But the question is, Dale,
are you ready?

01:36.677 --> 01:38.277
I think so.

02:01.237 --> 02:03.077
RACHEL GIGGLES

02:06.597 --> 02:07.557
How was that?

02:10.117 --> 02:11.397
BOTH: Fucking hell.

02:22.037 --> 02:24.397
Hiya, love. Busy day?

02:24.397 --> 02:25.637
Ha! Yeah, right.

02:25.637 --> 02:28.117
Just plotting my return
to Herbert Radcliffe Solicitors

02:28.117 --> 02:29.517
as chief partner.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.357
Don't you think it's time that you
started looking for another job?

02:32.357 --> 02:33.637
Nah, Dad'll be fine, Mum.

02:33.637 --> 02:35.597
I mean,
a vacancy for a giant dickhead

02:35.597 --> 02:37.397
is bound to come up somewhere soon.

02:37.397 --> 02:41.077
I don't need to look for a new job
because I'm getting my old one back.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.877
Oh, yeah?
How are you planning to do that?

02:43.877 --> 02:45.957
I know how you can get
your old job back.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.757
Oh, right. Come on, then.

02:47.757 --> 02:48.997
What's the big idea?

02:48.997 --> 02:51.997
Well, you take the other partners
for a nice, friendly curry,

02:51.997 --> 02:53.477
except for that Jane one.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.877
With her, you want to say
you're doing a charity skydive,

02:55.877 --> 02:58.837
and then, when you're up there, rip
the safety cord from her parachute,

02:58.837 --> 03:01.997
strangle her with it,
and then shove her out of the plane.

03:01.997 --> 03:05.637
And say something really cool like,
"See you around."

03:06.877 --> 03:09.357
That might actually work! Ken!

03:09.357 --> 03:12.317
The curry bit, obviously -
not the horrifying murder.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.797
Although, if I was going to do that,

03:13.797 --> 03:15.797
I'd say something cooler than,
"See you around."

03:15.797 --> 03:18.037
"Is it a bird? Is it a Jane?"

03:18.037 --> 03:19.557
Yeah.

03:19.557 --> 03:21.077
"Auf Wieders-Jane."

03:21.077 --> 03:22.557
Yeah, or, erm...

03:22.557 --> 03:24.077
We could have, erm...

03:24.077 --> 03:25.917
Erm... Oh...

03:25.917 --> 03:27.957
Yeah,
murder her or don't murder her,

03:27.957 --> 03:29.437
cos I really don't give a shit.

03:30.597 --> 03:32.557
I'm starting to worry about Dylan.

03:32.557 --> 03:34.517
Yeah? What was the turning point?

03:34.517 --> 03:36.277
When he shat
in his girlfriend's bath

03:36.277 --> 03:38.117
or, two years later,
when he shagged her mum?

03:38.117 --> 03:39.557
Good point.

03:39.557 --> 03:40.877
Anyway, this plan...

03:43.517 --> 03:46.317
Me and all the partners,
out for a curry tomorrow night.

03:46.317 --> 03:48.917
No Jane there
to poison them against me.

03:48.917 --> 03:50.757
Classic divide and conquer.

03:50.757 --> 03:54.557
Jane - the hopeless Turks...
Me - Genghis Khan,

03:54.557 --> 03:58.077
literally currying favour
with her employees.

03:58.077 --> 03:59.917
PHONE KEYPAD BEEPS

03:59.917 --> 04:02.717
It means I'll miss
Dale's opening night, but...

04:04.237 --> 04:08.037
Hello, I'd like to book a table
for six tomorrow night, please.

04:08.037 --> 04:09.837
The name?

04:09.837 --> 04:11.237
IN DEEP VOICE: Genghis Ken.

04:11.237 --> 04:13.077
SHE LAUGHS

04:13.077 --> 04:14.717
No, just Ken is fine.

04:14.717 --> 04:16.477
SHE LAUGHS
Oh, God...

04:25.477 --> 04:27.197
Not tonight, my love.

04:40.717 --> 04:43.437
PHONE CHIMES
Goodnight, Chief Ken.
Goodnight, Lorna.

04:45.317 --> 04:47.637
Night, Dylan.
DYLAN: Jesus, you bell-end!

04:47.637 --> 04:49.557
Oh, my bad, sorry!
DALE LAUGHS

04:49.557 --> 04:52.077
Wow, Dylan sure does love
to masturbate.

04:52.077 --> 04:53.117
Yeah.

04:54.557 --> 04:55.877
HE EXHALES

04:55.877 --> 04:57.997
Wow. I don't know how I'm going
to be able to get to sleep.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.037
I'm so excited for the launch.

05:02.157 --> 05:03.677
Dale... Mm-hmm?

05:03.677 --> 05:06.117
If I was to ask you to do something
that was bad for you,

05:06.117 --> 05:10.797
like, I don't know, eat raw pork,
would you do it?

05:10.797 --> 05:12.197
I'd say, "Hand me the sausage."

05:12.197 --> 05:14.277
You know I'd do anything for you,
Rach.

05:14.277 --> 05:15.637
Yeah, I do.

05:18.357 --> 05:19.517
Goodnight.

05:22.957 --> 05:25.797
SIGHING

05:25.797 --> 05:27.837
So, when do you want me to do it?

05:30.477 --> 05:32.917
Cos I'm going to be pretty busy
tomorrow with the launch,

05:32.917 --> 05:35.357
but I might be able to pop back
a few sausages in the morning.

05:35.357 --> 05:36.997
It was hypothetical.

05:36.997 --> 05:38.357
That's a relief. Yeah.

05:44.637 --> 05:46.517
And hypothetical means...?

05:48.557 --> 05:50.157
You don't have to eat the sausage.

05:50.157 --> 05:52.597
Oh! OK. Awesome.

06:00.117 --> 06:01.157
Night, Rach.

06:11.157 --> 06:13.917
It's only for six months,
so I'll be back before you know it.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.557
Sierra Leone?

06:15.557 --> 06:18.917
Wow. Oh, it's a beautiful
part of...Asia?

06:18.917 --> 06:21.677
It's Africa. Yes, I knew that. Yeah.

06:21.677 --> 06:24.677
Anyway, you two are going to have
a great time over there.

06:26.157 --> 06:27.917
I don't think I should bring Dale.

06:29.357 --> 06:31.437
Oh, Jesus. It's a biggie.

06:31.437 --> 06:34.037
Is this because he stranded you
on the Pennines?

06:34.037 --> 06:36.037
You can't stay angry at him forever.

06:36.037 --> 06:37.957
I'm not angry.

06:37.957 --> 06:39.757
Dale's happy here.

06:39.757 --> 06:41.277
He's put his life into his bar,

06:41.277 --> 06:42.957
and if I ask him to come,
he'll come.

06:42.957 --> 06:44.237
And don't you want him to come?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.597
No, I want him to come
but, deep down,

06:46.597 --> 06:48.877
even if he says he wants to come,
I know he wants to stay,

06:48.877 --> 06:51.317
and I have to go.

06:51.317 --> 06:53.357
I'm all over the shop here, Rach.

06:53.357 --> 06:54.797
What is it you're trying to say?

06:54.797 --> 06:58.397
Dale would do anything for me,
and this wouldn't be fair.

06:58.397 --> 07:01.477
If I ask him to come, he'll say yes.

07:01.477 --> 07:04.117
He's like a big lovely...

07:04.117 --> 07:05.717
..Labrador.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.437
He even catches Frisbees
in his mouth.

07:14.317 --> 07:15.797
Yeah, that's hard.

07:18.957 --> 07:21.557
Oh, that's terrible. She's crazy.

07:21.557 --> 07:22.757
I know.

07:22.757 --> 07:24.037
Hey, guys!

07:24.037 --> 07:26.437
Oh, hi, Ken. What are you doing
here? Aren't you...?

07:26.437 --> 07:27.957
What, just because I've been fired

07:27.957 --> 07:30.117
means I can't come into my own
workplace any more?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.917
Erm... Yeah?

07:32.957 --> 07:35.597
I actually swung by to see
if you guys fancied going out

07:35.597 --> 07:37.917
for a big old curry tonight.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.957
My treat.
You can have a rice and a naan.

07:40.957 --> 07:42.077
Unlimited chutney.

07:42.077 --> 07:44.837
I mean, up to a point, obviously,
don't take the piss, but...

07:44.837 --> 07:47.997
Yeah, all right. Sounds good, yeah.
Great.

07:47.997 --> 07:51.677
And, hey, probably best
if we don't invite Jane, eh?

07:51.677 --> 07:54.677
Might be a little bit more fun
if it's just us lads.

07:54.677 --> 07:56.757
Sure, yeah,
probably better without her anyway.

07:56.757 --> 07:58.437
The fun sponge.

07:58.437 --> 08:01.197
Oh, dear. Are things not going great
with Jane?

08:01.197 --> 08:02.597
She's cracking the whip, mate.

08:02.597 --> 08:05.357
She doesn't even let us watch The
Good Wife in the office any more.

08:05.357 --> 08:08.117
We're all out of sync.
Noel doesn't even know Will dies.

08:08.117 --> 08:10.717
What?! That is a shame.

08:10.717 --> 08:12.717
An office needs fun, guys.

08:12.717 --> 08:15.197
But then, that is Jane, isn't it?

08:15.197 --> 08:19.637
Cruel, harsh, dour, joyless,

08:19.637 --> 08:22.277
really kills the mood
in any room, doesn't she?

08:22.277 --> 08:23.717
Yeah, like a fart in a lift.

08:26.637 --> 08:29.597
But the Germans will keep
re-electing her, won't they?

08:29.597 --> 08:31.677
You've got to hand it to the woman.
She's...

08:31.677 --> 08:32.997
Hello, Jane.

08:32.997 --> 08:34.197
Ken, what are you doing here?

08:34.197 --> 08:36.997
I thought you'd be at home watching
daytime telly and payday loan ads?

08:36.997 --> 08:38.997
Ken's taking us for a curry tonight.

08:40.357 --> 08:43.757
Great. I'll stick it in the diary.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.237
Glad you can make it.

08:45.237 --> 08:47.117
I know what you're doing, Ken.
Excuse me?

08:47.117 --> 08:49.837
If you think you can buy
your job back with a chicken korma,

08:49.837 --> 08:52.597
then you're even more ridiculous
than you look.

08:52.597 --> 08:53.717
See you tonight.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.957
Of course you would order a korma.

09:07.037 --> 09:10.117
Hey, Dale! Hey, Steve!
What's in the box?

09:10.117 --> 09:13.117
Our high-class, beach-side tiki bar
dress code.

09:13.117 --> 09:17.117
Bikinis, budgie smugglers...
Perfect for that beach-side vibe.

09:17.117 --> 09:21.077
All free - lost property
from the local leisure centre.

09:21.077 --> 09:22.717
Ha! That's genius.

09:22.717 --> 09:24.477
Yeah.

09:24.477 --> 09:27.877
Oh, man, I can't believe
we're finally ready.

09:27.877 --> 09:29.797
Ah, we're more than ready.

09:35.957 --> 09:40.037
Box of swimwear and the cheapest
strippers in the Midlands booked.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.917
Boom! Boom.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.077
I just wish Chief Ken was
going to be here to see it.

09:44.077 --> 09:45.837
Also, it's still no
to the strippers.

09:45.837 --> 09:49.197
What? Ken isn't coming?
Is it something I said? Ah...

09:49.197 --> 09:51.397
I wasn't there enough for him.
That's it, isn't it?

09:51.397 --> 09:52.917
No, he's just made plans.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.357
OK, I took my eye off the ball.

09:55.357 --> 09:56.757
Connie was back.

09:56.757 --> 09:59.237
We had a trial un-separation -

09:59.237 --> 10:00.597
13 days in a Travelodge,

10:00.597 --> 10:02.877
round-the-clock lovemaking
and rolling news.

10:02.877 --> 10:04.117
Tell Ken I can change.

10:04.117 --> 10:05.917
Right, but it's not you. Huh?

10:05.917 --> 10:08.517
He's just organized a curry for
a bunch of people at his office.

10:08.517 --> 10:09.797
Curry? Yeah.

10:09.797 --> 10:11.597
Oh, sorry.

10:11.597 --> 10:13.837
He needs to get his job back.
I get it.

10:15.277 --> 10:18.317
I just really wish he was going to
be here so I could propose to Rachel

10:18.317 --> 10:20.957
and he could see that I'm worthy
of marrying his daughter.

10:20.957 --> 10:22.277
You're marriage material.

10:22.277 --> 10:23.797
I'd marry you in a shot.

10:25.037 --> 10:26.197
Just say the word.

10:27.437 --> 10:29.077
No.

10:29.077 --> 10:30.517
Unless...

10:30.517 --> 10:32.957
No. You're right.
It would never work.

10:32.957 --> 10:34.997
HE SIGHS

10:34.997 --> 10:37.077
Hey, don't worry about Ken.

10:37.077 --> 10:38.237
I'll sort it out.

10:40.037 --> 10:41.597
Nina, it's Rachel. I'm...

10:41.597 --> 10:42.637
Rachel, hi.

10:42.637 --> 10:46.317
The Sierra Leone vacancy -
that's still open, right?

10:46.317 --> 10:49.997
God, yeah. I cannot begin to tell
you how fucked it is over there.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.317
Like, really fucked.

10:52.317 --> 10:53.957
I'd like to take it. Fab.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.517
Can you get to the embassy
in London tomorrow morning for 9.00?

10:56.517 --> 10:58.517
Only, otherwise I'll have to find
someone else.

10:58.517 --> 11:01.517
Tomorrow?
It would mean going tonight.

11:01.517 --> 11:03.637
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

11:03.637 --> 11:08.197
Good because, and again I cannot
stress this enough, they are fucked.

11:08.197 --> 11:10.077
Bye. Yeah. Bye.

11:20.157 --> 11:24.477
TO THE TUNE OF "THE PINA COLADA
SONG": # If you like tikka masala

11:24.477 --> 11:26.357

11:29.597 --> 11:32.237
# Garlic naan at midnight

11:32.237 --> 11:35.357
# La da di, la da di... #

11:39.357 --> 11:41.117
There's no keyhole.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.797

TYRE HISSES
Done and done.

12:03.317 --> 12:04.357
Evening!

12:05.677 --> 12:07.997
I could smell it, Lorn.

12:07.997 --> 12:10.437
They hate Jane
and they want big Ken back.

12:10.437 --> 12:12.357
It's going to be
mutiny on the bhaji.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.997
KEN CHUCKLES

12:13.997 --> 12:16.117
Come on, that was good.

12:16.117 --> 12:17.517
You shouldn't have to do this.

12:17.517 --> 12:19.397
You're better than them.

12:19.397 --> 12:22.877
Where's that big sexy tree of a man
who wanted to change the world

12:22.877 --> 12:24.677
through affordable tax
and property law?

12:24.677 --> 12:26.277
HE SIGHS

12:26.277 --> 12:27.597
He's tired, Lorn.

12:27.597 --> 12:28.677
So tired.

12:28.677 --> 12:31.597
Come on, you don't need them.

12:31.597 --> 12:34.837
You could work for yourself -
maybe even start your own firm.

12:34.837 --> 12:39.477
What?! I can't just go around
setting up a new Lichfield law firm.

12:39.477 --> 12:41.717
Are you out of your mind?!
I thought it'd be quite easy.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.717
Don't you just register it
at Companies House?

12:43.717 --> 12:45.237
No, you do not, Lorna!

12:45.237 --> 12:48.157
There are forms to be signed -
signed in triplicate!

12:50.477 --> 12:52.557
Ah, well. I tried.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.757
SIGHING

12:57.757 --> 12:58.797
Where is he?

13:04.677 --> 13:05.877
Do you lot work with Ken?

13:05.877 --> 13:07.477
Yes, why?

13:07.477 --> 13:09.637
There's been a change of plan -

13:09.637 --> 13:12.117
he wants you all to meet him
somewhere else.

13:12.117 --> 13:13.837
Where?

13:13.837 --> 13:17.197
HE EXHALES
It's a surprise. Come on.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.677
Why has he sent you?

13:18.677 --> 13:20.117
I'm your Uber.

13:20.117 --> 13:21.317
Chop chop!

13:23.037 --> 13:25.557
Come on! Chop chop,
or you'll miss the fun.

13:25.557 --> 13:26.877
Come on, Missy.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.717
Shit it!

13:46.717 --> 13:48.957
HE SIGHS

13:48.957 --> 13:50.397
Unbelievable.

13:54.037 --> 13:55.877
Oh. Oh, thank God.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.877
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

13:59.917 --> 14:01.357
Poppadoms, please.

14:01.357 --> 14:02.397
All the dips.

14:07.037 --> 14:08.437
It's amazing, really.

14:08.437 --> 14:10.877
I mean, Lichfield is
the shittest place on earth

14:10.877 --> 14:13.277
and they opened a bar
in the shittest part of it.

14:13.277 --> 14:14.477
Oh, just be nice, Dylan.

14:14.477 --> 14:15.757
Dale needs our support.

14:15.757 --> 14:18.517
It's like shit squared,
and Rachel's leaving him.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.517
She's not leaving him.
It's only for six months.

14:20.517 --> 14:22.877
Hey, and we're not supposed to say
anything.

14:22.877 --> 14:25.637
Rachel's going to talk to him
after the launch.

14:25.637 --> 14:28.357
The launch of the world's
shittest...

14:28.357 --> 14:30.397
LOUD MUSIC AND CHEERING

14:30.397 --> 14:31.837
..bar.

14:38.677 --> 14:42.557
Welcome to All Steve's Pals!

14:44.597 --> 14:47.277
Hey, guys! This is so amazing!

14:47.277 --> 14:49.477
I knew you could do it, bro!

14:49.477 --> 14:51.597
It's really good, Dale. Thanks.

14:51.597 --> 14:55.437
There is so much fanny in here.
I don't know how you do it!

14:55.437 --> 14:57.197
Neither do I!

She's not coming.

15:02.877 --> 15:03.917
Why?

15:03.917 --> 15:05.637
Well, I can't tell you why, Dale.

15:07.837 --> 15:10.597
Oh, OK, fine,
but you didn't hear it from me.

15:10.597 --> 15:11.637
OK.

15:11.637 --> 15:13.797
She's packing her bags
and leaving tomorrow morning -

15:13.797 --> 15:15.597
she's going to Sierra Leone.

15:15.597 --> 15:16.917
She's leaving?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.437
She didn't want to tell you tonight,

15:18.437 --> 15:20.557
because she didn't want to ruin
your launch.

15:20.557 --> 15:22.797
Well, smart move. It totally has.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.797
She's so perceptive.

15:24.797 --> 15:27.957
But, wait, Rachel has to be here.

15:27.957 --> 15:31.117
I mean, all of this is
to show her how committed I am.

15:31.117 --> 15:33.357
I'm only doing this for Rachel.
Are you?!

15:33.357 --> 15:34.597
Yes!

15:34.597 --> 15:37.637
Well, then, in that case,
you have to tell her, now!

15:37.637 --> 15:40.517
HE EXHALES
Go get her, Dale.

15:40.517 --> 15:41.677
Go get her.

15:41.677 --> 15:42.677
I will!

15:45.277 --> 15:47.157
Thanks, Lorna.

Ken, you have to get down
to All Steve's Pals now.

16:14.997 --> 16:16.037
The partners are...

16:16.037 --> 16:18.597
Lorn, I can't talk now. The partners
will be here any minute.

16:18.597 --> 16:22.277
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
The partners are here.

16:22.277 --> 16:24.677
What?!

16:24.677 --> 16:26.677
Ken...
KEN GRUNTS

16:37.837 --> 16:38.957
Excuse me!

16:38.957 --> 16:40.677
# One, two, three, four... #

16:57.157 --> 16:58.877
Yeah! Oi!

16:58.877 --> 17:00.837
Ken! You made it. What do you think?

17:00.837 --> 17:02.717
What do I think?!

17:02.717 --> 17:04.997
GLASS SMASHES
Oi! I think I'm going to kill you,

17:04.997 --> 17:06.357
and not as in a figure of speech.

17:06.357 --> 17:07.637
Like, actually kill you!

17:07.637 --> 17:10.037
One of the most important nights
of my professional life,

17:10.037 --> 17:12.557
and you have kidnapped
my colleagues.

17:12.557 --> 17:14.037
Kidnapped is a strong word...

17:14.037 --> 17:16.557
You've kidnapped them and
you've brought them to this...

17:18.357 --> 17:19.597
..quite nice bar.

17:19.597 --> 17:22.237
Ken, take a deep breath
and drink this.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.357
Yeah, your colleagues are here.
Look, they're having a great time.

17:27.357 --> 17:29.757
Look, Sandeep's got his tie
on his head,

17:29.757 --> 17:32.837
Adrian's vaping, and I'm pretty sure
Noel has done a pill.

17:32.837 --> 17:34.917
They've had free drinks all night,

17:34.917 --> 17:37.037
and I told them
they were courtesy of you.

17:37.037 --> 17:39.437
Ken! Great night!

17:39.437 --> 17:41.757
I can't believe
you arranged all of this! Well...

17:41.757 --> 17:43.117
We miss you, big guy.

17:43.117 --> 17:44.877
Come back to the firm!

17:44.877 --> 17:48.637
This might be the cocktails talking,
but we need you back, Ken.

17:48.637 --> 17:51.077
HE SOBS
We need you back.

17:51.077 --> 17:54.757
I haven't had an erection
in three years, Ken.

Please don't go.

18:53.037 --> 18:54.957
Oh. You found it?

18:54.957 --> 18:56.397
Is this...? Yep.

18:58.077 --> 19:00.117
Rachel Thompson, will you...?

19:00.117 --> 19:02.397
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:02.397 --> 19:04.917
OK. Just FYI, I was going to say,
"..marry me?"

19:04.917 --> 19:08.077
Yeah, I know you were.
Dale, I am not ready for marriage.

19:08.077 --> 19:09.357
We are not ready.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.557
OK, but that doesn't mean
you have to leave.

19:12.557 --> 19:14.557
I have to.

19:14.557 --> 19:16.317
I want you to be happy.

19:16.317 --> 19:20.197
You've put everything
into your life here, the bar...

19:20.197 --> 19:23.517
The bar?
I was only doing that for you.

19:23.517 --> 19:25.517
Why would I want a beach bar
in Lichfield?

19:25.517 --> 19:26.717
Ken said.

19:26.717 --> 19:29.237
He told me I should show you
that I can be a provider

19:29.237 --> 19:30.837
and take care of you.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.157
That's...that's terrible advice!

19:34.157 --> 19:37.317
Yeah, I'm starting to see that now.

19:37.317 --> 19:41.397
Rachel, my only dream
is being with you,

19:41.397 --> 19:44.637
and if that means moving
to Sierra Leone, then great.

19:44.637 --> 19:47.677
Really? Yes, really.

19:47.677 --> 19:50.117
I'm coming with you, Rach,

19:50.117 --> 19:51.237
if you want me to.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.157
Yeah. Yeah?

19:54.157 --> 19:56.277
Yeah! OK!

19:56.277 --> 19:58.237
Let me pack.

19:58.237 --> 19:59.717
Done!

20:04.957 --> 20:07.997
Come on, let's get a cocktail.
I can pack later.

20:07.997 --> 20:09.997
There's a new bar
I want to check out.

20:09.997 --> 20:12.677
Apparently some hot American barman
works there.

20:12.677 --> 20:14.957
Yeah, probably not a good idea
for me to visit

20:14.957 --> 20:17.117
a rival bar on opening night.

20:17.117 --> 20:20.757
Oh, I got it, you're talking
about All Steve's Pals.

20:20.757 --> 20:23.597
I'm talking about All Steve's Pals.
OK, yeah, let's go! OK.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.277
THEY LAUGH
Woohoo!

20:26.277 --> 20:28.117
OK, Lorna, here we go.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.597
Having a good time, Jane?

20:36.597 --> 20:37.837
I'm shitfaced.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.037
Yay!

20:40.037 --> 20:44.997
Listen, Ken, I've seen the way
the partners are with you -

20:45.757 --> 20:48.557
it might be good
if you were to come back.

20:48.557 --> 20:51.077
What?! Are you serious?!

20:51.077 --> 20:54.077
But I need to know you'll be loyal.

20:54.077 --> 20:56.557
You'll have to respect my authority,

20:56.557 --> 21:00.797
and I can't have you
outside the tent pissing in.

21:00.797 --> 21:02.637
I won't. I promise.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.237
I promise I won't piss
inside the tent.

21:04.237 --> 21:06.357
I'll piss miles away from the tent.

21:06.357 --> 21:07.717
You won't even notice my piss.

21:07.717 --> 21:08.997
Stop saying piss, Ken.

21:08.997 --> 21:11.517
There is one condition, though.

21:11.517 --> 21:15.397
If I do let you back in,
I'll look weak.

21:15.397 --> 21:19.197
I need you to show you're loyal
in front of the others.

21:19.197 --> 21:20.637
Right.

21:20.637 --> 21:22.157
Bend the knee.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.397
What?

21:23.397 --> 21:25.037
It's not Game Of Thrones, mate.

21:25.037 --> 21:27.997
Get on your knees,
beg for your old job back,

21:27.997 --> 21:31.917
let the partners see,
and then we all get what we want.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.037
No. No, no, no, no!

21:39.037 --> 21:40.637
You are not begging to this...

21:42.117 --> 21:44.637
Help me, Dylan,
you're good at horrible insults.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.237
Bitch? Yeah, this bitch!

21:47.237 --> 21:50.117
No, I'm so sorry about my wife.
She appears to be hammered.

21:50.117 --> 21:51.957
No, Ken. I've had enough of this...

21:51.957 --> 21:52.997
Dog's dick?

21:52.997 --> 21:55.437
..dog's dick treating you
like you're not good enough.

21:55.437 --> 21:57.277
Now, you listen to me.

21:57.277 --> 21:58.517
My husband's a...

21:58.517 --> 22:00.717
Ten foot bell-end?
No. Do you want to...?

22:00.717 --> 22:05.317
My husband's a great man,
and he doesn't need you, Jane,

22:05.317 --> 22:08.397
and he doesn't need
your bloody twatty little firm!

22:08.397 --> 22:09.957
He needs... Statins?

22:09.957 --> 22:12.517
He needs to chase his dreams.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.877
He's starting his own firm.

22:17.237 --> 22:18.597
Am I?

22:18.597 --> 22:20.317
Yes. Yes, Ken.

22:22.277 --> 22:24.077
Yes.

22:24.077 --> 22:26.117
Yes, I am!

22:26.117 --> 22:28.557
I'm not standing for this.

22:28.557 --> 22:29.957
Auf Wieders-Jane.

22:29.957 --> 22:32.357
Yeah! Oi! That's MY one.

22:32.357 --> 22:34.637
See you later, you Jane in the arse!

22:34.637 --> 22:36.757
Yeah!

22:36.757 --> 22:38.717
Yeah.

22:38.717 --> 22:41.557
I am. I am starting my own firm!

22:41.557 --> 22:44.517
I love you, Ken. I am!

22:44.517 --> 22:47.197
Right, drinks are on the house.

22:47.197 --> 22:49.077
CHEERING

22:49.077 --> 22:53.557
One round of the house special
cocktail, the Flaming Ken.

22:53.557 --> 22:54.717
ALL: Ooh!

22:54.717 --> 22:56.117
Flaming Ken?

22:56.117 --> 22:59.437
It's tall. It's fiery.
It's got balls.

22:59.437 --> 23:00.717
Cheers, mate. Big balls.

23:00.717 --> 23:02.357
Balls you can hold in your hand.

23:02.357 --> 23:04.317
Balls that get the job done.

23:04.317 --> 23:07.357
The best damn balls
in the whole of Ballstown.

23:07.357 --> 23:09.277
Fuck off.

23:09.277 --> 23:11.477
Flame up!

23:11.477 --> 23:12.877
Oh!

23:12.877 --> 23:15.437
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Yeah!

23:15.437 --> 23:17.517
Is it a good idea to have
so many naked flames

23:17.517 --> 23:19.557
in a largely bamboo bar, Steve?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.597
That really spread.

23:27.597 --> 23:30.117
That fire's fucking beautiful, man.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.677
Oh, thank God. Get in there quick!

23:33.677 --> 23:36.997
Oh, they're not real firemen, Ken.
They're strippers.

23:36.997 --> 23:39.637
Thanks for coming anyway, guys.
Ah! Ooh-rah!

23:39.637 --> 23:42.037
They do this amazing routine
with a hosepipe and a glove.

23:42.037 --> 23:45.157
Never mind that, your bar's on fire!

23:45.157 --> 23:50.197
You know, All Steve's Pals, Ken,
it was never going to work,

23:50.477 --> 23:53.557
so I decided to "accidentally"
burn the place down.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.597
The insurance pay-out on this baby
is going to be huge.

23:56.597 --> 23:59.717
But you went to so much effort
to make the place work.

23:59.717 --> 24:01.997
Deniability, Lorna, deniability.

24:01.997 --> 24:04.197
I mean, what kind of nutbag
goes to all that effort

24:04.197 --> 24:05.837
just to burn the place down
on purpose?

24:05.837 --> 24:08.677
My God, you're a psychopath.

24:08.677 --> 24:10.517
Oh, thank you, Ken.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.357
Coming from you, that means a lot.

24:12.357 --> 24:13.357
Oh...

24:14.397 --> 24:15.597
What happened?

24:15.597 --> 24:18.717
Ask this bloody idiot
and his Flaming Kens!

24:18.717 --> 24:20.877
I'm so sorry, Dale.

24:20.877 --> 24:24.197
I'm OK. It's just weirdly sad
seeing months of hard work

24:24.197 --> 24:26.837
literally go up in flames.

24:27.917 --> 24:29.237
Oh, well.

24:29.237 --> 24:31.237
Got to keep smiling, right?

24:31.237 --> 24:34.397
Oh, Chief Ken, me and Rach,
we're going to Sierra Leone.

24:34.397 --> 24:36.637
What? You're going to Africa? Yeah.

24:36.637 --> 24:38.117
And at what point did you think,

24:38.117 --> 24:40.077
"Oh, I don't know,
I might tell my bloody dad"?!

24:40.077 --> 24:41.197
It was very sudden.

24:41.197 --> 24:43.037
Also, I took your advice
and proposed,

24:43.037 --> 24:45.277
but we're not getting married.
Yeah, thanks for that, Dad.

24:45.277 --> 24:48.117
Life coaching definitely isn't your
forte. Don't quit the day job.

24:48.117 --> 24:49.477
Funny you should say that, Rach.

24:49.477 --> 24:51.557
He literally has just quit
his day job!

24:51.557 --> 24:52.757
What? What?

24:52.757 --> 24:55.037
Right. Well,
a) I don't know why YOU'RE laughing

24:55.037 --> 24:57.677
because you were VERY active
in that decision, and,

24:57.677 --> 25:00.917
b) my actual advice was to get a job
before you get married.

25:00.917 --> 25:03.557
But instead you went into business
with a maniac,

25:03.557 --> 25:07.997
you opened a cocktail bar, and now
your cocktail bar is on fire.

25:07.997 --> 25:10.757
It's probably best that I'm not part
of the family quite yet.

25:10.757 --> 25:12.077
Dale...

25:13.277 --> 25:14.917
No, you are.

25:14.917 --> 25:19.517
You ARE part of the family -
this weird, messed-up family.

25:22.837 --> 25:24.677
Fucking hell.

25:24.677 --> 25:27.317
You guys are still getting paid.
Come on!

25:27.317 --> 25:28.717
Oh, no.

25:28.717 --> 25:31.357
Aw... Our family together.

25:31.357 --> 25:33.197
Mum. Dylan?

25:33.197 --> 25:35.397
COLLAPSING BUILDING CRUNCHES
Oh.

25:35.397 --> 25:37.677
Yep, everything's fine.

25:37.677 --> 25:39.837
Come on, lads!

MUSIC: Modern Love
by David Bowie

25:41.717 --> 25:44.597
# I know when to go out

25:44.597 --> 25:47.517

CHEERING

25:52.597 --> 25:55.277
# I catch a paper boy

25:55.277 --> 25:58.037
# But things don't really change

25:58.037 --> 26:00.637
# I'm standing in the wind

26:00.637 --> 26:03.077
# But I never wave bye-bye

26:06.317 --> 26:09.677
# But I try

26:09.677 --> 26:11.197
# I try

26:16.877 --> 26:19.357
# There's no sign of life

26:19.357 --> 26:21.957
# It's just the power to charm

26:21.957 --> 26:24.637

26:38.197 --> 26:41.037
# Never going to fall for
Modern love

Modern love

Modern love

26:46.117 --> 26:50.077
# Gets me to the church on time

26:50.077 --> 26:51.597
# Church on time

26:51.597 --> 26:54.117
# Terrifies me
Church on time

26:54.117 --> 26:56.677
# Makes me party
Church on time

26:56.677 --> 27:00.717
# Puts my trust in God and man

# No confessions
God and man

# No religion
God and man

27:07.197 --> 27:11.237
# Don't believe in modern love... #
