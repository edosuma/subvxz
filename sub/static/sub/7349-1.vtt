How can I be upsettin' the baby
when the baby ain't even born yet?

34:15.262 --> 34:18.222
Oh, yeah? How would you like to be up there,
listening to you yell?

34:18.306 --> 34:19.681
I wouldn't be up there in the first place,

34:19.766 --> 34:21.559
because I have nothin' to do
with that stinky Tommy.

34:21.643 --> 34:22.935
- Mamma!
- What do you got against Tommy?

34:23.018 --> 34:24.228
He's a nice boy.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.231
No kid that hits me over the goddamn head
with a chair is a nice boy.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.315
He's marrying her, ain't he? He's a nice boy.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.693
(SCREAMS) Mamma!

34:30.777 --> 34:32.152
(WATER DRIPPING)

34:32.862 --> 34:37.032
- ELLA: Look what you made her do.
- Oh, Jesus! What the hell is that?

34:37.659 --> 34:39.076
What are you stupid or something?

34:39.161 --> 34:41.911
She broke her water.
Now she's going to have the baby!

34:41.996 --> 34:46.125
She can't have the baby yet. It is too soon.
She ain't even married yet!

34:57.094 --> 34:58.637
Okay, come on.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.531
(WHISPERS) Wait a minute.

35:18.033 --> 35:21.869
Vin, this guy ain't gonna wait no minute
for his blow job.

35:23.747 --> 35:24.747
(LAUGHS)

35:27.667 --> 35:28.959
You fuck.

35:32.214 --> 35:35.591
What are you waiting for?
What's the matter with you?

35:36.384 --> 35:39.595
- I don't like guys pushing my head!
- Come on, goddamn it!

36:11.002 --> 36:13.671
- Where the fuck were you?
- What are you talkin' about?

36:13.755 --> 36:16.382
Oh, you knew I had him over there.
Why didn't you konk him?

36:16.466 --> 36:19.885
What, that guy? Jeez, we thought
it was your new boyfriend.

36:19.970 --> 36:20.970
(SAL LAUGHING)

36:21.471 --> 36:26.225
- You thought it was funny, you bastards?
- "I don't like guys pushing my head!"

36:26.768 --> 36:27.977
Fuck all of you.

36:28.061 --> 36:30.604
- All right, come on, give.
- Fuck your mother.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.691
- Give me the bread.
- You didn't do nothing. I keep the money.

36:33.775 --> 36:34.859
Hey!

36:39.614 --> 36:42.491
- Christ, you work cheap.
- Give me my money.

36:42.576 --> 36:44.285
Fuck whose mother?

36:48.874 --> 36:51.083
You cheap thieving bastards!

36:52.127 --> 36:53.627
(MUSIC PLAYING)

36:54.629 --> 36:56.589
Give me a drink, Willie.

36:56.673 --> 37:00.134
Oh, we're closer, give us one first.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.888
- Yeah, give us one here.
- Give me mine first. You girls screw yourself.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.557
Hey, you shouldn't talk to my girlfriend
like that.

37:06.641 --> 37:10.853
- That douchebag?
- Douchebag? Who you calling a douchebag?

37:11.146 --> 37:13.689
Soldier, you should be able to do
better than that.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.567
Hey, now you keep
your shitty mouth shut, you hear me?

37:16.651 --> 37:18.736
Shove it up your ass, you...

37:18.820 --> 37:20.946
Quit squawking here. Who needs a drink?

37:21.031 --> 37:24.909
(LAUGHING) You want a drink?
I'll buy you a drink.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.870
- Sure, you can buy me a drink.
- ANNIE: Nothing to do with her.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.915
- But not in this crummy dump.
- She don't need nothing.

37:30.999 --> 37:34.418
- See, he ain't going nowhere.
- Oh, yeah?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.213
Hey, where are you going?

37:38.798 --> 37:42.635
Hey, we could go to this bar
I heard about in Manhattan.

37:42.719 --> 37:45.679
- SAL: Look at that.
- A lot of officers go there.

37:47.641 --> 37:49.558
- Manhattan, huh?
- Yeah.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.229
Yeah, okay.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.525
Hey, go that way first.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.820
What's she doin'?
How we supposed to lump him in a cab?

38:01.905 --> 38:04.698
Don't worry about it, she'll give us a signal.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.369
Hey, Tralala, where are you going?

38:08.995 --> 38:11.413
- What the hell kind of signal is that?
- Oh, that was cute.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.875
Where are you going?
Hey, Tralala, where are you going?

38:17.379 --> 38:20.547
- Hey, what's bugging her?
- Who knows? Who cares?

38:21.341 --> 38:24.426
Look, let's just get high, all right?
Who's springing for a cab?

38:24.511 --> 38:25.970
Don't look at me.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.013
- Tony?
- No fuckin' chance.

38:29.182 --> 38:32.393
Hey. What about our boy Harry?

38:35.855 --> 38:37.231
TONY: Harry.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.149
Harry.

38:51.246 --> 38:52.287
VINNIE: Come on, fellas.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.755
- Here, keep the change. Give me a receipt.
- Okay.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.424
No, no, I'll fill it in. Thanks.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.259
- DRIVER: Take it easy.
- Sure.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.846
SAL: God, I'm dying for a drink.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.891
SAL: Hey, somebody's coming down.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.938
Hey, is this where the party's at?

39:19.607 --> 39:22.234
You sure we got the right party here?

39:24.821 --> 39:27.448
Sweetheart, I'm Vin, what's your name?

39:28.450 --> 39:31.201
What's the matter with that broad,
don't she talk?

39:35.790 --> 39:39.877
- Hey, sweetchips. How's the leg?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.379
Yeah? Well, you know Sal and Tony.

39:43.089 --> 39:46.258
- And this is Harry from the union.
- Hi, Harry.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.970
Everyone, this is Miss Camille.

39:52.015 --> 39:55.100
And this is our hostess Miss Goldie.

39:55.185 --> 39:58.103
SAL: Christ, that faggot looks like a showgirl.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.647
And over here is Regina.

40:02.025 --> 40:03.025
Wow.

40:03.610 --> 40:05.694
TONY: Hey, Vin, You didn't tell us
this was Georgie's party.

40:05.779 --> 40:09.073
- GOLDIE: Everybody, sit down and relax.
- Give them the booze, Harry.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.116
- Huh?
- The booze.

40:11.201 --> 40:13.327
- What?
- Give them the booze.

40:14.704 --> 40:18.707
- How marvelous, more libations.
- Hey, hey, watch your language.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.294
Hey, you know, Harry buys
whatever he wants, booze, food,

40:22.378 --> 40:24.838
anything he wants and the union pays for it.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.508
You must be quite a big man
in the union, Harold.

40:28.009 --> 40:31.637
Yeah, I'm in charge of the strike.

40:31.721 --> 40:34.014
Are you on strike against sitting down?

40:34.099 --> 40:35.641
(LAUGHS)

40:38.686 --> 40:42.272
Rosie, be a dear, and refill the ice bowl.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.275
- Mmm-mmm.
- Do as I say at once,

40:45.360 --> 40:49.446
or you'll be out on the street
with the other freaks, Miss Cocksucker.

40:49.656 --> 40:52.533
SAL: (LAUGHING) Hey, don't worry, chippy.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.618
Maybe just fuck you a little.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.870
(LAUGHING)

41:00.250 --> 41:04.545
- What a weirdie she is.
- SAL: At least we got one real one here, huh?

41:06.798 --> 41:09.383
You should have asked us
to show you how, Harold.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.219
There's no sense in wasting good pot
on amateurs.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.638
I didn't realize your friends were so square.

41:16.683 --> 41:19.351
Let me show you how to do it, Harold.

41:21.813 --> 41:26.483
It ain't that hard, Harry. All you gotta do
is put it in your mouth and suck.

41:30.905 --> 41:31.905
(COUGHS)

41:32.115 --> 41:33.782
(ALL LAUGHING)

41:40.206 --> 41:41.206
(MUSIC PLAYING)

41:48.381 --> 41:50.132
You know somethin'?

41:51.134 --> 41:55.512
You're good looking.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.183
And I'm gonna show you a good time.

41:59.309 --> 42:02.561
Yeah, sure, I'll show you the time of your life.

42:21.581 --> 42:22.789
Light.

42:25.168 --> 42:26.168
Please?

42:27.128 --> 42:28.462
Yeah, sure.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.929
Second Looey, huh?

42:38.306 --> 42:39.389
Yeah.

42:39.724 --> 42:43.769
- I just got out of OCS.
- And they're already shippin' you out?

42:45.688 --> 42:47.648
I got my orders today.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.652
So are you buying me a drink?

42:52.737 --> 42:54.988
Yeah. What would you like?

43:00.954 --> 43:04.998
This dump is dyin'. Maybe we ought to
go somewhere else to drink.

43:08.962 --> 43:13.131
- It's okay with me.
- Wait here, I gotta tell my brother I'm leaving.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.892
I thought you were gonna show me
a good time.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.018
You bet.

43:26.646 --> 43:29.606
The waiter's here. He wants to know
if you have any money.

43:29.691 --> 43:33.652
- Show him your money so I don't have to pay.
- You bet.

43:42.036 --> 43:44.496
There, you see, I told you he had money!

43:45.039 --> 43:46.456
(SNORING)

43:47.709 --> 43:50.460
- So, where are you from?
- Idaho.

43:51.296 --> 43:52.546
Have you ever been there?

43:52.630 --> 43:54.256
- To Idaho?
- Yeah.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.926
I'm from Brooklyn, man.
I don't even know around here.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.845
I don't understand. If you're from here...

43:59.929 --> 44:03.390
This is Manhattan.
I don't go out of the neighborhood.

44:05.059 --> 44:07.644
New York is a lot different
than I thought it'd be.

44:07.729 --> 44:12.482
The whole time I've been here, it seems
like all I've done is walk around by myself.

44:12.567 --> 44:15.652
I was startin' to think
I wasn't gonna meet a single soul here.

44:15.737 --> 44:18.405
You got anything to drink at your hotel?

44:18.489 --> 44:20.824
A sack of whiskey I brought from home.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.577
I was saving it for my last night here,

44:24.662 --> 44:26.496
but we could drink it if you like.

44:27.957 --> 44:29.750
Is it far from here?

44:30.293 --> 44:33.420
No, it's just a couple of blocks.
We could walk.

44:35.506 --> 44:36.506
Okay.

44:40.928 --> 44:44.931
Thank you, Rosie.
Be a good girl, scoop up the empties.

44:47.393 --> 44:51.646
What's the matter, Rosie? Afraid of my lob?

44:54.359 --> 44:58.403
(LAUGHING) Come here, Rosie.
I got a nice, fat stratnyanka for you.

44:59.781 --> 45:00.864
(GROANS)

45:00.948 --> 45:04.451
- Look at what that bitch did to me.
- What's the matter, Sal, you got a boo-boo?

45:04.535 --> 45:05.952
Don't worry, I won't let him hurt you.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.414
You're not to touch her,
do you understand me?

45:09.499 --> 45:12.042
- Where is that crazy bitch?
- You leave her alone, she's just a girl.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.378
Stop, stop! Vinnie, do something.

45:14.462 --> 45:15.879
Sal's mad now.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.005
Stop!

45:17.799 --> 45:20.384
This is getting rather sordid.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.094
Why don't we go?

45:30.478 --> 45:33.105
I'll show you who's a fairy.

45:33.189 --> 45:34.314
Motherfucker!

45:34.982 --> 45:36.858
You wanna look like a broad, huh?

45:36.943 --> 45:38.652
You gonna get fucked like one.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.278
Hey, Vin, you want a piece of this?

45:51.207 --> 45:54.543
One for Vinnie, one for me,

45:56.337 --> 45:59.172
one for Vinnie, one for me,

46:00.425 --> 46:01.425
one for Vinnie.

46:03.136 --> 46:04.136
(LAUGHS)

46:16.149 --> 46:17.524
Tral!

46:19.986 --> 46:21.361
How come you're dressed?

46:21.446 --> 46:22.904
I was gonna go out for cigarettes.

46:24.866 --> 46:26.741
- There are some left there on the dresser.
- Oh.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.916
You know, I only have
a couple of days left before I ship out.

46:36.711 --> 46:38.712
I was thinking that maybe
we could spend them together.

46:39.881 --> 46:41.715
What do you mean, "Spend them together"?

46:44.844 --> 46:47.387
We could go to the movies, shopping,

46:48.556 --> 46:49.723
I'll buy you a dress.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.893
Do things that couples do.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.728
Man, you must've really liked it, huh?

46:56.230 --> 46:57.606
(LAUGHS) Come here.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.616
Not too small for you?

47:09.452 --> 47:12.078
I think they're the best
in the Western world, Tral.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.789
But that's not what I'm talking about.

47:16.667 --> 47:20.295
I'm not gonna have the chance to be
like this with someone again for a long time.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.257
Maybe never!

47:27.428 --> 47:28.929
- You understand?
- Yeah!

47:30.598 --> 47:34.935
I like that. The best tits in the Western world.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.316
Vinnie, Vinnie?

47:46.280 --> 47:47.447
Vinnie!

47:52.620 --> 47:53.870
Where are you?

47:53.955 --> 47:56.748
I was having the most delightful dream.

47:56.832 --> 47:59.668
- Vinnie!
- Vinnie's gone, dear.

47:59.752 --> 48:00.752
Gone?

48:00.836 --> 48:02.629
You seemed to be having such a lovely sleep.

48:02.713 --> 48:05.048
He didn't want to wake you to say "Goodbye."

48:05.132 --> 48:06.883
Goodbye?

48:06.968 --> 48:12.138
Vinnie!

48:17.853 --> 48:19.187
(SOBBING)

48:25.444 --> 48:26.987
Vinnie!

48:28.281 --> 48:29.739
Where are you?

48:33.494 --> 48:34.953
(TIRES SCREECHING)

48:36.831 --> 48:38.999
WOMAN: Oh God, did you see that?

48:41.168 --> 48:42.544
Oh, my God.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.228
(ENGINE RUNNING)

49:09.113 --> 49:10.447
What do they think they're doing?

49:22.793 --> 49:25.128
What the hell is going on here?

49:25.212 --> 49:28.173
Hey, hey. No truck here!

49:28.257 --> 49:29.549
No trucks here!

49:30.635 --> 49:32.636
(ALL YELLING)

50:13.969 --> 50:15.095
Oh!

50:27.441 --> 50:29.984
Hey, hey!

50:31.445 --> 50:32.445
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Shut up.

50:37.159 --> 50:38.284
(HONKING)

50:49.797 --> 50:50.797
Oh, Christ.

50:52.508 --> 50:53.508
Oh, fuck.

50:59.473 --> 51:00.724
(CROWD SHOUTING)

51:00.808 --> 51:02.517
Let me through, let me through.

51:05.312 --> 51:06.896
MAN: Where the hell you been, Harry?

51:17.450 --> 51:20.410
You on the gate, that's factory property.
Get off there.

51:20.494 --> 51:22.996
- Fuck you, goon!
- Tell them, Harry!

51:23.080 --> 51:25.123
I'm warning you, fellow,
you better get the hell off there!

51:25.207 --> 51:26.666
Yeah, or what?

51:27.585 --> 51:28.918
Eat shit, goon!

51:29.003 --> 51:30.712
(CROWD SHOUTING)

51:36.135 --> 51:38.887

for the wonderful, delicious sandwiches.

01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:37.218
Oh, oh, oh, I see the head
of our union coming in, Boyce,

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:39.470
and we'd like to thank him

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:43.933
for helping us with a union loan,
especially for the party.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:46.727
(CROWD APPLAUDS)

01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:56.111
First I wanna congratulate Joe and his family.

01:32:56.196 --> 01:32:59.573
Tommy and Donna are good kids
and I wish them the very best,

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:01.492
and may they have many little ones.

01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:06.372
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:07.414
Thanks, Boyce.

01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:10.167
And now, I see a lot of union men
here tonight,

01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:13.045
and I want you guys to be the first to know.

01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:17.216
At tonight's meeting with management
those SOB's finally gave in.

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.136
You hear me? We beat them.
We're going back to work Monday morning!

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:22.888
The strike is over!

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.516
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.640
Hey! What's the matter with you,
riding your bike in here?

01:34:06.725 --> 01:34:08.976
- You seen Tral around?
- Get that thing out of here!

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.562
Go on! Get it out! Get it out of here! Go on!

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:30.331
- Is anyone keepin' score here?
- Who the fuck can count that far?

01:34:43.595 --> 01:34:45.637
STEVE: Dear Tral,

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:47.473
I wish there was some way for you to know

01:34:47.557 --> 01:34:49.975
how much the time we spent together
has meant to me.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:53.604
I hope and pray that I will live
through this war

01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:56.899
and that someday you and I
will see each other again.

01:34:58.151 --> 01:35:02.404
Until then, I'll dream about the day
when I come back and see your face

01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:07.076
and we can once again be together
like we were these last few days.

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:10.454
Love, Steve.

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:28.305
Good, now I'm not last in line.

01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:31.642
(LAUGHS)

01:35:33.812 --> 01:35:35.270
Get away from her.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:38.315
Get away!

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:41.110
Get away from her!

01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:44.321
- Get away, leave her alone.
- What's wrong with you? Take it easy.

01:35:45.198 --> 01:35:47.366
All of you, leave her alone.

01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:50.369
Leave her alone!

01:36:41.087 --> 01:36:43.422
(CRYING)

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:37.309
Don't.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.520
(SHUSHING)

01:37:42.315 --> 01:37:49.863
Don't cry.

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:24.356
(WORKERS ALL GREETING EACH OTHER)

01:38:31.197 --> 01:38:35.450
Listen, any problems with Donna,
problems with the marriage...

01:38:35.535 --> 01:38:38.078
What do you say, Joe?
Tommy!

01:38:38.162 --> 01:38:40.080
You come to me, understand?

01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:44.167
I've been with Ella 26 years,
never had a single problem.

01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:45.752
So I know what I'm talking about here.

01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:47.671
How's the baby doing?

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:51.842
Cries all day, shits all over the place.

01:38:54.846 --> 01:38:55.846
He's real good.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:56.930
(LAUGHING)

01:38:57.305 --> 01:39:03.641
