01:22.700 --> 01:24.383
You're nervous.

01:26.419 --> 01:31.657
Well... I don't know
what to say.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.759
She likes football players,
right?

01:33.761 --> 01:33.759
Yeah.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.395
Why don't you just tell her
you're trying out...

01:36.397 --> 01:37.696
For the team next year?

01:40.166 --> 01:41.400
I'm not.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.240
God forgives the white lies.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.176
Edward...

01:53.346 --> 01:55.214
Don't give her a chance
to say "no."

01:56.416 --> 01:58.317
You're a good catch.

02:06.559 --> 02:09.627
You just find that confidence
deep inside you...

02:09.630 --> 02:12.164
And all shall see it.

02:17.904 --> 02:22.474
Buddy, you gotta lose the pin.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.910
It's gonna make a bad first
impression.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.549
I'll train you.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.356
She's the one... go get her.

03:11.624 --> 03:13.559
Welcome gift from the girl.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.474
Dad!

07:07.160 --> 07:08.927
He is not worth it.

07:12.131 --> 07:13.799
Hey!

07:13.801 --> 07:16.201
What the hell? Let go of me.
I don't even know you.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.738
No, but we feel the same way
about that whore.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.807
I caught my boyfriend mounting
her in the pool house...

07:21.809 --> 07:23.875
An hour ago.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.545
God... I'm-- I'm sorry.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.014
I'm gonna go tell him
she's got three nipples.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.816
And now we're relocating.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.186
Okay... wait. Actually, I have a
better idea. Come with me.

07:34.188 --> 07:36.521
Woo-hoo!

07:38.791 --> 07:40.125
I'm Jesse, by the way.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.093
Oh, Kim... I got to Ben Wilder
high.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.563
Ah, I was wondering why
i hadn't seen you before.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.069
Oh! What's up there?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.904
Ahh. The good stuff.

07:56.876 --> 08:00.545
Seeing as this is now my soon
to be ex-boyfriend's house...

08:00.547 --> 08:03.582
I think I'm inclined to treat
myself to some spoils.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.050
Don't you?
Mm-hm.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.223
That's a little inflammatory,
don't you think?

08:11.225 --> 08:15.694
Not as inflamed as he'll be.
She's had chlamydia twice.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.063
Mm-hm.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.098
Do you think I should delete it?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.533
No! Fuck him.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.668
Yeah! Fuck him!

08:23.670 --> 08:27.105
Uh-oh! Stupid bitch problems
go in room 102, ladies.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.142
What the hell? What do you want,
Toby?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.010
What do <i> you</i> want?

08:33.013 --> 08:36.047
Dr. horvath's Percocet,
yoga Emily's dexedrine...

08:36.049 --> 08:37.749
Or my dad's sublimaze?

08:37.751 --> 08:38.984
Let's get out of here.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.552
One minute.

08:40.554 --> 08:46.024
So, boys, what do all
these make me feel?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.627
The pills?
Yeah.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.295
Uh...

08:52.231 --> 08:58.103
The perco is gonna numb you and
then lift you. It's intense.

08:58.105 --> 09:02.107
And then this one, uh...
Kinda is the same thing...

09:02.109 --> 09:04.142
But it's an inactive kind
of numb.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.244
So, you know, don't operate
any heavy machinery.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.746
Okay.
Vroom-vroom.

09:07.748 --> 09:11.149
Yeah... so, what about
the minocycline?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.183
What's that gonna make me do?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.052
Yeah, that one is--

09:14.054 --> 09:16.688
I wouldn't take more than
one half of one pill there...

09:16.690 --> 09:18.657
Because it hits you fast,
and it fills you with this--

09:18.659 --> 09:20.959
numbness?

09:20.961 --> 09:24.629
Yeah, it's weird, because when
Kim's mom gives it to the cat...

09:24.631 --> 09:28.600
It doesn't seem to do shit.

09:28.602 --> 09:33.171
Yeah. You know, there's nothing
sexier than a guy...

09:33.173 --> 09:36.808
Who doesn't know what the fuck
he's talking about.

09:38.611 --> 09:42.113
You guys need to stop selling
animal drugs to teenagers, okay?

09:42.115 --> 09:43.214
We're out of here.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.650
Later, douche bag.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.221
Nice work, man.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.637
Oh, my god... that was brutal!

10:05.639 --> 10:07.238
Whatever.
Brutal.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.810
Screw all of them. I can't wait
to get the hell out of here.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.946
Wait, do you graduate tomorrow,
too?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.047
Yeah, 10:00 am sharp.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.850
Oh, my god, wow.

10:18.852 --> 10:23.855
You know, I just want my last
night as a high schooler...

10:26.125 --> 10:28.093
To be a good one,
you know what I mean?

10:28.095 --> 10:33.999
And if that means me, this here
bottle, then so be it.

10:34.001 --> 10:37.969
It sounds like you want
to wallow.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.270
I--

10:39.272 --> 10:42.674
do you trust me, Jessie?

10:42.676 --> 10:44.309
Don't answer that.

10:44.311 --> 10:48.313
This short skirt, high-heeled
combo is not going to waste.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.083
Let's go dancing, you and me,
looking like this, single...

10:52.085 --> 10:56.287
Now? No-- i-- this isn't exactly
club attire.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.289
You're right, you're
overdressed. Take off the shawl.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.725
Okay, yeah, you want me
to take it off?

11:00.727 --> 11:02.360
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
I'll be like this...

11:02.362 --> 11:05.697
In the club, dancing by myself,
little half-naked action.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.332
Oh, that's good. Uh-huh.
Yeah, you like that?

11:16.776 --> 11:21.246
Okay, all right, you know what?
Let's do it.

11:21.248 --> 11:24.783
As long as I can go home
first and change.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.752
I like you, Jessie.
We're gonna have so much fun.

11:27.754 --> 11:31.256
We better. Wait, what's your
Twitter handle?

11:31.258 --> 11:34.826
I will hashtag us
"two scorned girls".

11:34.828 --> 11:36.695
Uh, I deleted mine actually.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.430
There are like way too many
creeps on there.

11:38.432 --> 11:41.299
Oh, god, don't I know.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.135
I think I'm in too deep
to delete.

11:49.308 --> 11:52.877
Although, I think it would do
more damage tonight...

11:52.879 --> 11:55.447
If Kent got to see the picture
that I posted.

11:55.449 --> 11:56.981
You're genius.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.417
I know.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.119
All right, let's get out
of here.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.249
Okay, what club do you think
we should go to?

12:31.251 --> 12:35.787
Um, oh, there's that place
downtown called hyperdrive.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.789
Never has a long line...

12:37.791 --> 12:40.458
And it doesn't look too trashy
or discriminating age-wise.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.761
That's a plus... all right.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.530
Who are you texting...
What?

12:45.532 --> 12:46.898
While driving?

12:46.900 --> 12:48.133
Who'd you just invite
to the club?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.901
I know that mischievous look.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.238
Okay, fine, uh, it's this guy
i met a while back.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.140
He graduated last year.

12:55.142 --> 12:58.109
He was super into me, but you
know, not in a creepy way.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.246
Ooh, is he, um...
Is he a theater nerd?

13:01.248 --> 13:02.313
No.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.082
A quarterback?
No.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.886
Your principal?
He's more of a bad boy.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.356
Yeah, he's rough around
the edges... he's got tattoos.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.224
I know.
Okay.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.895
Hey! No, no, no, no!
Don't, don't, don't!

13:16.897 --> 13:18.897
Hands on the wheel.

13:18.899 --> 13:23.401
"I was just thinking about you,
too! See you soon, pretty girl".

13:23.403 --> 13:24.969
He thinks I'm pretty.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.006
Oh, my gosh, you are
a pretty girl, aren't you?

13:28.008 --> 13:30.074
Why, yes, I am a pretty girl,
aren't I?

13:30.076 --> 13:31.309
Don't you dare!
Kissy face! He's gone.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.012
Agh! Not emoticons!
I used emojis!

13:34.014 --> 13:35.180
I hate those!

13:54.501 --> 13:56.935
Oh, my gosh.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.605
Dude! This club looks ghetto
as hell.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.373
Okay, listen,
I'm a prissy bitch...

14:02.375 --> 14:05.276
But I do not want to get
rejected my first try.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.178
This club is a sure thing.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.247
Yeah... yeah, no, you're right.

14:09.249 --> 14:12.116
I mean, it's not like we're
going to Compton.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.551
Yeah.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.386
Shut up! Come on.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.894
Hey, back so soon? We would
have saved you some dinner.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.362
Yeah.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.632
Hi... mom and dad, this is my
new friend, Kim.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.067
Hi, Kim.
Hi.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.002
Are you girls hungry?

14:31.004 --> 14:34.105
Oh, no, no, no, no. We're about
to go to a movie, actually.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.875
We were sick of meatheads
doing keg-stands.

14:39.311 --> 14:42.146
Oh, your grad gift is upstairs,
sweetie.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.381
You can open it tonight,
if you want.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.283
Thank you, guys,
i appreciate it.

14:45.285 --> 14:49.621
Yeah, no more excuses when we
can't get hold of you.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.022
It's nice to meet you, Kim.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.123
Okay, nice to meet you, too.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.258
Come on. Bye!

14:53.260 --> 14:55.193
Bye, sweetheart.
Bye.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.231
Oh my god, I love your room!

15:00.233 --> 15:02.400
I know, I'd never leave it
if I didn't have to.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.604
Oh, nice.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.378
Yes!

15:15.347 --> 15:17.148
That's it?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.984
Do you have like a ticket
voucher to Amsterdam on there?

15:19.986 --> 15:23.554
What? No. I'm not greedy.
I'm practical.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.057
Yeah, and your last phone
narrowly escaped...

15:26.059 --> 15:27.659
That comet that killed
the dinosaurs.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.427
Shut up!
What?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.229
Don't talk about her like that,
she's very sensitive.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.497
Oh.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.632
Farewell, my old friend.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.338
That's weird.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.675
What?
Someone was already on.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.276
What's wrong with it?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.680
I don't know, hold on.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.481
Did you guys buy me
a used phone?

15:50.483 --> 15:54.085
No, and don't be sassy
about a gift, Jessie.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.656
All right, wait, this is really
weird.

15:58.658 --> 16:03.528
There's already pictures.
That's my house.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.563
And my room?

16:26.018 --> 16:27.618
Oh, my god.
Miles!

16:27.620 --> 16:30.455
What the hell?
That is not funny!

16:30.457 --> 16:33.091
Oh, god, it was hysterical.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.361
Okay, enough, miles.
Just go to your movie already.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.428
Yeah.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.197
Sorry, this is my brother.

16:39.199 --> 16:44.135
Oh, my god, you are gorgeous,
I'm miles.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.470
Kim.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.773
Kim...

16:48.775 --> 16:52.110
You make my heart swell, Kimmy.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.778
Jeez, you made everything
about me swell.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.446
Okay.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.382
Okay, you're the creepiest
person I've ever met.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.284
You don't mean that.
Shut up, don't bother her.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.787
Oh, my gosh, my feelings.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.756
What else did you do to my
phone, miles?

17:04.758 --> 17:08.393
Well, you know, just gave you
all the coolest new apps.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.794
You're welcome.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.362
Where is your old phone?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.498
Here.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.267
Oh, my god, what a piece
of shit... fuck it.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.170
Hey! I gotta get all my old
stuff off of there!

17:19.172 --> 17:22.773
Just give it another minute
to finish, relax.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.675
Wait, miles, did you go
through any of my photos?

17:25.678 --> 17:29.580
No, hell no, I'm afraid
of what I might see.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.282
Good.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.683
If that's what you're
concerned about...

17:32.685 --> 17:34.519
Then you'd better go
before I start changing?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.287
Oh, Jess, it touched my face.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.422
Hah-hah.

17:42.361 --> 17:49.367
So, Kimberly... what club
are we going to?

17:49.369 --> 17:51.702
How did you know about that?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.404
I heard you when you walked in.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.473
You know, I'm just impressed,
honestly...

17:55.475 --> 17:57.608
You're actually gonna leave
brentwood for once.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.444
You can't tell mom and dad.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.813
Look, for all you know,
we're going to a movie, okay?

18:01.815 --> 18:06.217
Jess, you know I have never
been very good at lying.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.419
Oh, please?

18:08.421 --> 18:12.523
Please, just for once,
don't be a little shit.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.760
No, no, I can't oblige here,
sis.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.864
I mean, unless, you know,
i could go to this...

18:19.866 --> 18:22.166
You know, this "movie"
with you guys.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.201
I knew that was coming.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.802
Yeah, you did.

18:24.804 --> 18:28.106
Come on, please, I'd really like
to see a little more...

18:28.108 --> 18:29.574
Of your friend here,
if you know what I mean.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.676
I'm sure the feeling's mutual.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.779
He's not always this
pervy, I swear.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.247
No.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.150
Hmm...

18:39.152 --> 18:40.585
Okay, you can come.
What?

18:40.587 --> 18:42.420
Oh! Oh-pah!

18:42.422 --> 18:46.858
But, but, but, listen, you can't
do anything, anything...

18:46.860 --> 18:48.192
Unless I let you, okay?

18:48.194 --> 18:50.528
I am not arguing.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.829
But, um, hold on one second.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.265
What is this Logan guy's
last name?

18:54.267 --> 18:59.670
How do you even know his na--?
Barlow, why?

18:59.672 --> 19:02.406
Because, I want to check arrest
records...

19:02.408 --> 19:03.741
And make sure you're not
boning a criminal.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.809
Oh, please, come on.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.145
Wait! Wait! Wait!

19:07.147 --> 19:09.347
Okay, okay.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.482
Okay, you can have it.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.518
You know, that's what
brothers are for.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.719
Okay.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.622
I will see you girls out front.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.825
Can't wait. Later, ladies.
Shall we?

19:41.413 --> 19:44.949
How are you supposed to get some
with him hanging around?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.217
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.785
Excuse me?

19:47.787 --> 19:51.255
Look, if things go rotten,
it's much easier...

19:51.257 --> 19:53.291
If both siblings are
on the chopping block.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.760
The punishment would be like
a lot less harsh, I'm hoping.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.295
Okay.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.297
So, where'd you guys meet
anyway?

19:59.299 --> 20:02.767
Butt end of a...
Blonde joke.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.702
Yes!

20:04.704 --> 20:08.206
Hey, do you have a photo of the
guy she's been texting?

20:08.208 --> 20:12.310
I do not, but for you,
i can find anything.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.444
Thanks.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.745
What?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.348
You know,
it's the 21st century.

20:17.350 --> 20:21.752
Oh god, Jess, please tell me you
did not meet him...

20:21.754 --> 20:23.254
On a "hot or not" page.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.422
I didn't! I didn't.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.525
Oh, he is cute. Yay!

20:27.527 --> 20:28.993
You seem so surprised?

20:28.995 --> 20:32.630
Well, yeah, because I just dm-ed
him this photo of you.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.498
When did you take that?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.567
That is not okay.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.003
You could've picked any number
of skank snaps from her iPhone.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.972
Skank snaps? Do you say that?

20:40.974 --> 20:43.241
You said you didn't look at my
photos, you little pervert!

20:43.243 --> 20:46.310
It was an accident!
And I regret it terribly.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.613
Jessie, you're a budding nympho,
it's okay.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.281
Why did you send him that?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.450
Like, we're about to pick him
up! Undo it!

20:52.452 --> 20:55.486
It is not snapchat.
That shit is permanent.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.421
Okay, okay, Logan is yummy...

20:57.423 --> 20:59.657
And is gonna keep your mind off
the bullshit tonight.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.595
Oh... she is nervous.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.997
Okay, okay, i--

21:05.999 --> 21:07.265
I think that's called
excitement.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.933
It's a little bit of both.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.402
Breathe, because you
are so nervous.

21:11.503 --> 21:12.803
Shut up.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.319
Wait, this is where he lives?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.955
Yeah, he's 19, he doesn't live
with his parents anymore.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.790
Don't be a pussy, miles.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.493
We can't all live in bel-air
behind security gates.

21:35.495 --> 21:40.431
No, that's not what
i was saying.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.434
I just-- I don't know anything
about this guy.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.702
I'm worried for your sake.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.037
Oh, thank you, you--

21:46.039 --> 21:48.572
what kind of person do you
think lives down here?

21:48.574 --> 21:49.940
Okay.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.376
Miles, you strong-armed me
into coming out.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.346
Are you really gonna
knit-pick on where we go?

21:55.348 --> 21:56.881
You can not smoke that--

21:56.883 --> 21:58.749
okay, I'm not allowed to?
Yeah, take it from me.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.485
Get out of my face.
Ooh, me, gimme, gimme.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.521
Thanks.

22:03.523 --> 22:06.023
And you know what? I'll probably
just pick up another eighth...

22:06.025 --> 22:07.491
From this drug dealer
boyfriend of yours.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.827
Hey.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.697
You need to watch your mouth,
brentwood.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.365
Where we're going tonight,
saying shit like that...

22:14.367 --> 22:16.600
Is how you get your ass kicked.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.678
Oh, my god.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.480
What the fuck?

22:29.482 --> 22:32.116
Dude, I'm joking, I'm joking.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.918
My name's Logan.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.653
I'm fucking with you,
it's what it's like.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.088
I'm miles.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.923
That's miles, my brother,
and this is Kim.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.691
Hello.
Hey.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.860
See? I told you I'm come out.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.695
I'm glad you weren't lying.

22:45.664 --> 22:48.532
Ready?
Let's roll.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.446
Jessie?

23:10.956 --> 23:12.423
Hey!

23:12.425 --> 23:14.024
What's your fucking problem,
bro?

23:14.026 --> 23:15.926
Let's just get out of here.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.915
So, Logan... what do you do?

23:37.917 --> 23:40.518
I'm in school, studying
graphic design.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.086
Very nice.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.655
He's being modest,
he's actually really good at it.

23:44.657 --> 23:49.560
What true value is there to
being really good at Photoshop?

23:51.730 --> 23:53.731
How's that for value?

23:55.801 --> 23:57.201
No shit.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.970
Guess you're not that much
of a joke, after all.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.574
Hey, Jess, I would have made you
one, too, but I ran out of time.

24:03.576 --> 24:06.811
Plus, that pic you just sent me
is a little too risqué.

24:06.813 --> 24:10.815
Uh... I didn't send that to you,
actually that wasn't even--

24:10.817 --> 24:11.949
ssh.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.717
As cute as this is...

24:13.719 --> 24:15.453
How about you tell us where
we're going tonight?

24:15.455 --> 24:17.721
Um, the best downtown club
you've never heard of.

24:17.723 --> 24:20.024
And by best, she means
the worst ID checkers.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.226
Yes, I do.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.595
Okay, so these two can flash
their titties to get in.

24:24.597 --> 24:27.031
Miles!
But what am I gonna do?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.699
You could show them your dick.

24:31.603 --> 24:34.939
Ah, don't worry about it, man,
we'll figure out a way in.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.046
Freak.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.914
Didn't know this was
Halloween already.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.727
Ian, come on.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.292
Yikes.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.794
Shit looks seedy.

25:30.796 --> 25:34.665
This area may identify itself
as downtown now...

25:34.667 --> 25:36.834
But I heard before the
operation...

25:36.836 --> 25:40.971
It was, uh, referred to as...
The ghetto.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.040
Oh, come on, this isn't
even that bad.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.675
There's tougher places.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.910
Yeah, and I'm sure we'll pass
through them...

25:45.912 --> 25:47.645
On our way to the club.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.261
Okay.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.263
Two-one coming in.
Thank you.

26:26.618 --> 26:29.620
Come on, now we're having fun.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.188
Vodka redbull, right?
Thank you.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.791
Thank you.
Cheers.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.027
I'm going to go check on your
brother, okay?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.362
Okay.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.364
I'm a little stressed.
I know.

27:04.656 --> 27:08.792
Jessie... come on, Jess,
pick up... pick up.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.696
Oh, my god!
What?

27:12.698 --> 27:14.898
Kent wants to facetime.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.200
How drunk is he?

27:16.202 --> 27:18.402
Drunk enough to say he's sorry.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.170
Okay, you have to fuck with him!

27:20.172 --> 27:21.905
No, I don't.
Yes, you do!

27:21.907 --> 27:26.076
Hey, hey, hey, he cheated on you
at his graduation party...

27:26.078 --> 27:29.213
In front of everyone.
I know that.

27:30.882 --> 27:32.883
Should i--
go kiss Logan.

27:49.300 --> 27:52.903
There's someone out here, Jess.
Jess, I'm worried someone's--

27:57.075 --> 27:58.942
all right.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.111
Excuse us.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.346
Sorry!

28:06.685 --> 28:10.020
Oh, my god.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.322
You are a bad bitch.
I love you.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.024
I love you!

28:14.026 --> 28:15.426
I wouldn't have even
come out...

28:15.428 --> 28:17.361
If my misery didn't have
such great company.

28:17.363 --> 28:21.965
Misery? Screw that, let's get
elated.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.300
Oh...
Do you have any cash?

28:23.302 --> 28:25.402
I do.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.072
Here.
Fuck with this.

28:30.008 --> 28:33.010
What is that?
Pure love and cuddles, baby.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.179
Turn this perfect ten night
into a hundred.

28:36.147 --> 28:37.347
Wow.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.849
I'm not like a druggie
or whatever.

28:38.851 --> 28:39.950
You don't have to do any.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.820
No, I know that.

28:42.822 --> 28:46.857
I mean, miles is right. I guess
i can be kind of like a prude.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.794
I don't mean to be!

28:50.796 --> 28:53.097
Hey, fine, it's fine!
Don't worry! Seriously.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.732
It's okay.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.104
Wow. Hah! You did it.

29:02.140 --> 29:04.241
Fuck it! I'll do it.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.242
Yeah?
Yeah.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.844
Okay, girl!

29:10.482 --> 29:12.916
All right-- oh, shit!

29:12.918 --> 29:14.985
I am so sorry.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.888
It's fine! That's fine. Don't
worry, let's just... use yours.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.523
Lord knows how many
bare asses...

29:19.525 --> 29:20.958
Have banged on this sink
tonight.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.359
Gross.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.828
Here.
Cool.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.230
Thank you.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.768
Okay.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.269
After you.

30:23.254 --> 30:24.454
Have you seen Kim?

30:24.456 --> 30:26.089
You want another drink?

30:26.091 --> 30:30.160
No... have you seen Kim?

30:30.162 --> 30:31.562
She's right outside,
she's on her phone.

30:31.564 --> 30:33.130
Is she okay?

30:33.132 --> 30:34.565
What?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.033
Never mind!

30:40.271 --> 30:44.474
Kim! She has my phone,
my brand, new phone!

30:44.476 --> 30:48.011
What? Wait, why does she
have your phone?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.179
In the bathroom, we used it--

30:49.181 --> 30:50.581
for drugs.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.516
All right, all right,
where does she live?

30:52.518 --> 30:54.518
I have no clue.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.888
This is not the place for a sexy
drunk chick to get lost.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.958
I know that! I'll call my phone.

31:05.563 --> 31:07.064
Straight to voicemail.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.266
Oh, shit, wait...

31:09.268 --> 31:11.368
Did you hear about all the
sexy, drunk chicks...

31:11.370 --> 31:14.204
That went missing from
this exact club?

31:14.206 --> 31:17.074
I heard in-n-out burgers have
been extra meaty since.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.642
All right...

31:18.644 --> 31:20.444
Don't even joke about that shit.
Do you think you're funny?

31:23.114 --> 31:27.384
Miles, when you moved all of my
stuff over to my new phone...

31:27.386 --> 31:32.356
Did you move everything over?

31:34.959 --> 31:36.994
Okay, okay--

31:36.996 --> 31:39.196
what? Why is this bad?

31:39.198 --> 31:42.266
My e-mail account, my bank
accounts, my phone numbers...

31:42.268 --> 31:46.370
My-- my personal photos.

31:46.372 --> 31:49.139
Well, even though some
ghetto-ass dude...

31:49.141 --> 31:50.674
Is definitely gonna see you
naked...

31:50.676 --> 31:55.045
And probably, you know,
steal our identity...

31:55.047 --> 32:00.083
Your amazing brother synced the
recovery app on your phone.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.552
So we can find Kim.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.966
It's fritzing out, stop the car.

32:17.235 --> 32:19.002
What do you mean?

32:19.004 --> 32:21.204
It's fritzing out, it's not
working, Jess.

32:23.508 --> 32:26.076
Yo, what's this dude looking at?

32:26.078 --> 32:27.611
It's ah-- it's moved again.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.516
You look ridiculous.
Does that even work?

32:32.518 --> 32:35.352
Stop, it's recalibrating.

32:38.589 --> 32:41.191
You know, big sis...

32:41.193 --> 32:46.029
Maybe we just go home,
get some sleep...

32:46.031 --> 32:47.497
You know, do the regular
thing...

32:47.499 --> 32:49.299
Contact her in the morning.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.568
Sure, we'll just tell mom
and dad that, you know...

32:51.570 --> 32:53.170
I was chillin' at a movie...

32:53.172 --> 32:55.605
While my phone was
hanging out downtown?

32:55.607 --> 32:58.675
I swear to god, if I'm going
down for this I am dragging--

33:00.144 --> 33:01.712
yo, what the hell are you doing?
Put up the window!

33:01.714 --> 33:03.180
Put that shit up!

33:03.182 --> 33:03.180
Hey, now don't get cute,
pretty boy...

33:03.182 --> 33:06.049
Gimme the keys and get out
of my car now!

33:06.051 --> 33:08.518
Whoa! Okay, what the fuck?
Drive, Jessie!

33:08.520 --> 33:10.120
Oh, my god!
Drive, Jessie! Drive!

33:10.122 --> 33:12.055
All right! All right!

33:13.458 --> 33:15.058
Fuck you!

33:16.561 --> 33:18.695
Holy shit!

33:21.065 --> 33:24.434
Okay, all right,
that was pretty bad-ass.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.703
Whatever, let's just keep going.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.573
What's Kim's last name? I'll
check if she tweeted anything.

33:29.575 --> 33:30.574
It's Garcia, but--

33:30.576 --> 33:32.442
school?
Ben Wilder.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.144
Ben Wilder.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.616
Whatever we gotta do,
I'm here for you, okay?

33:39.618 --> 33:43.754
Thank you, Logan, that's--
that's nice of you.

33:43.756 --> 33:47.624
No social media anything.
Not even a fucking linkedin.

33:47.626 --> 33:51.728
Hey, bro, you can ask for her
resume when we find her.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.768
Did you fucking say something?

34:03.442 --> 34:06.309
Jess, Jess, the dot's back up.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.217
There she is.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.386
Yeah, pull over here.

34:24.128 --> 34:27.597
Well, she couldn't have picked
a creepier location.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.366
What do you think
she's doing here?

34:29.368 --> 34:32.469
Buying more drugs.
Shut up.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.304
Maybe she just, you know,
went home with a rando...

34:35.306 --> 34:37.808
And was too messed up
to tell us.

34:37.810 --> 34:39.242
Maybe she lives here.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.813
Oh, come on, we can't all live
on the westside.

34:42.815 --> 34:47.350
Look, either way, she has my
phone and I want it back.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.319
Okay?

34:49.321 --> 34:54.324
We can just-- we can just
like wait it out.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.226
No?

34:56.228 --> 34:58.528
I'll check it out.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.632
Um, I'll-- I'll come with you.

35:06.304 --> 35:09.739
Okay, this is not necessary.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.604
All right, I say we check
the perimeter...

35:40.606 --> 35:42.839
See if there's another way in.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.675
Roger that, Jack Bauer.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.875
Doesn't seem very smart
for a smart girl.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.779
Yeah, well, I was stupid and it
looks like I have made my bed...

36:22.781 --> 36:24.848
Now I have to lay in it.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.650
Actually, I was talking
about Kim...

36:26.652 --> 36:28.285
But if you're comfortable
complimenting yourself...

36:28.287 --> 36:30.220
That's totally cool.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.678
Stupid, little horse.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.816
Did you just feel the drip?
Huh?

36:59.818 --> 37:03.520
How do your fingers feel?

37:03.522 --> 37:08.291
That'll last like an hour
or so, you'll be fine.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.627
I'm actually glad that
you know that.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.763
Anything?
Nope.

37:30.948 --> 37:33.316
Excellent. Hah!

37:44.929 --> 37:46.696
Well, hello.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.743
First time coming down?

37:59.745 --> 38:01.511
Yeah, and last.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.881
Yeah, I wasn't the best kid
at first...

38:04.883 --> 38:06.783
But I figured it out pretty
quick.

38:08.753 --> 38:10.387
Better than I did.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.888
This is the first time
i stepped out of line,

38:11.890 --> 38:14.924
here I am, just trying
to get my phone back.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.594
I know it sounds-- it sounds
so stupid now, but...

38:17.596 --> 38:21.798
That phone has more dirt on me
than anyone I know.

38:24.402 --> 38:25.802
Oh, come on...

38:25.804 --> 38:27.070
Don't act like you don't
have anything...

38:27.072 --> 38:28.805
Embarrassing on your phone.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.640
I don't know what you're
talking about.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.743
Oh, please, I bet you're like
the king of snapchat.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.944
The king of what?

38:34.946 --> 38:36.046
Snapchat.

38:36.048 --> 38:38.315
What's snapchat?

38:38.317 --> 38:39.482
Are you kidding me?

38:39.484 --> 38:41.384
I'm not-- I'm not, no.

38:41.386 --> 38:43.586
Wow.

38:57.501 --> 39:00.370
Hello?

39:00.372 --> 39:01.738
Argh!

39:01.740 --> 39:04.040
Fucking miles! What the hell?

39:04.042 --> 39:06.376
Oh, my god.

39:07.578 --> 39:09.779
Whoa.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.617
What the fuck?

39:15.986 --> 39:18.722
Have you even looked for Kim?
Nah.

39:18.724 --> 39:22.492
Kim? Kim!

39:22.494 --> 39:25.428
Kim!
Ssh!

39:26.464 --> 39:27.997
Oh.

39:35.773 --> 39:37.040
No shit.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.109
Dude, where did you come
in from?

39:39.111 --> 39:40.944
Uh... here.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.752
Agh!

39:48.754 --> 39:50.687
You didn't have to crawl
through that.

39:53.691 --> 39:58.461
So, I'm guessing no one is
home...

39:58.463 --> 39:59.929
Which is weird, because--

39:59.931 --> 40:02.599
what? What is it?

40:02.601 --> 40:06.936
The good news is that your
phone is still here.

40:06.938 --> 40:10.607
Okay, and... is there bad news?

40:10.609 --> 40:13.176
I only have five percent
battery left on my phone.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.044
What?
Oh, well...

40:15.046 --> 40:16.579
Just use Logan's phone.

40:18.182 --> 40:20.550
Yeah, uh...

40:22.653 --> 40:24.854
What is that?

40:24.856 --> 40:26.823
You might as well have a beeper.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.625
Okay.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.996
Okay, it's not really working.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.165
Oh, oh, okay, yeah,
use your phone, Jess.

40:35.167 --> 40:37.033
Oh, wait, you don't have
a phone, do you?

40:37.035 --> 40:39.169
Shut up.

40:39.171 --> 40:42.071
Where do you guys think we
should start first?

40:42.073 --> 40:44.107
Why don't we ask him?

40:45.176 --> 40:47.577
How would I know?

40:47.579 --> 40:52.182
I don't know, you know, it's
just a little convenient...

40:52.184 --> 40:54.984
That shit gets raw
as soon as you show up.

40:54.986 --> 40:59.756
Wait. He didn't mean that.
I swear, sorry.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.991
That's fine. It's fine.

41:06.063 --> 41:07.897
What the fuck are you doing?

41:07.899 --> 41:10.066
Fuck, who knows, he could
be a killer or something.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.135
Now you just stop it, stop it.

41:17.575 --> 41:20.243
I would kill for some water
right now.

41:25.249 --> 41:31.488
Oh... hey, which shot is worse,
hepatitis or tetanus?

41:31.490 --> 41:34.791
Well, both go in the ass,
so you won't feel a thing.

41:37.561 --> 41:40.163
Jess, look at this!
Move over.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.033
Yeah!

41:50.140 --> 41:51.241
Come on.

42:01.919 --> 42:04.053
How are you getting
reception in here?

42:04.055 --> 42:07.590
Do not compare your phone
to mine, bro.

42:07.592 --> 42:10.660
See, a tech-savvy guy like me...

42:10.662 --> 42:14.097
Would never get a piece of shit
phone like that?

42:14.099 --> 42:16.900
Oh, you got $200 you could
loan me?

42:16.902 --> 42:20.169
Yes, yes, actually, I do.

42:20.171 --> 42:23.239
Here, all right-- whoa!
Where are you going?

42:23.241 --> 42:26.276
Smart phone, dumb ass.

42:26.278 --> 42:29.612
Hey, wait!

42:29.614 --> 42:32.549
Look, maybe we should split up,
find your phone faster, yeah?

42:32.551 --> 42:34.951
Okay, but if we're
splitting up...

42:34.953 --> 42:37.921
Absolutely no longer
than 15 minutes, okay?

42:37.923 --> 42:40.123
I don't want to lose track
of either of you.

42:40.125 --> 42:43.293
Fine, let's time it.

42:43.295 --> 42:47.297
Does your sundial here have
like an alarm clock?

42:47.299 --> 42:48.865
It's getting old.

42:48.867 --> 42:50.900
All right, back here in 15.

42:51.936 --> 42:53.603
Okay. Good luck.

42:56.674 --> 42:58.808
Good... have fun!

43:59.036 --> 44:01.104
Hello, Jesse and Logan.

44:18.689 --> 44:20.690
Whoa.

44:29.867 --> 44:32.368
Hey! Those are Kim's heels.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.003
You sure?

44:34.005 --> 44:36.372
Yeah, she jammed them in my shin
while we were dancing.

44:36.374 --> 44:37.840
I'm positive.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.042
Well, see? Maybe she
does live here.

44:39.044 --> 44:40.810
That wouldn't make sense.

44:40.812 --> 44:44.180
If she goes to Ben Wilder high,
then she has to live near me.

44:46.884 --> 44:48.718
Let's just find my phone and
find Kim...

44:48.720 --> 44:51.120
And get the hell out of here.

44:51.122 --> 44:54.691
Yeah, yeah, leaving sounds
great.

44:58.095 --> 45:01.364
What is going on with all
these cameras?

45:05.769 --> 45:08.037
See you guys later.

45:15.713 --> 45:19.315
All right, you take those rooms
down there, I'll go down here.

45:21.985 --> 45:25.288
Aw... oh, god, perfect!

45:39.970 --> 45:41.771
Motherf--

46:11.935 --> 46:14.537
well, hello, ladies.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.973
Whoa-ho-ho.

46:16.975 --> 46:19.408
What do we have here?

46:19.410 --> 46:25.114
Felicia, Rachel... play date.

47:19.536 --> 47:21.237
Ugh.

47:36.620 --> 47:39.055
Fucking--
sorry, I'm sorry.

47:39.057 --> 47:39.055
Oh, my god.

47:39.057 --> 47:41.357
I have to show you this.
Come here.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.465
Okay.

48:13.357 --> 48:15.992
Oh, god.

48:22.332 --> 48:24.100
What the hell is in there?

48:24.102 --> 48:26.235
Hopefully your phone.

48:34.111 --> 48:36.279
This was locked a second ago.

49:35.439 --> 49:37.440
That's fucking disgusting.

49:38.575 --> 49:41.010
What the fuck is this?

50:36.767 --> 50:39.735
Your guests seem nice.

50:58.388 --> 51:00.656
Where actually are you?

51:08.832 --> 51:10.232
Shit, is that Kim?

51:12.569 --> 51:14.603
Holy shit, that's Kim.

51:28.652 --> 51:31.587
Shit... it's the alarm.

51:31.589 --> 51:34.123
Let's-- let's not leave your
brother hanging, yeah?

51:34.125 --> 51:36.125
Yeah.

51:36.127 --> 51:39.295
Wait, wait, wait...
I saw something.

52:04.655 --> 52:06.822
Shit, run!

52:24.307 --> 52:25.574
Are you okay?

52:25.576 --> 52:27.676
Who are you?

52:27.678 --> 52:29.478
Mom.

52:33.183 --> 52:34.750
Shit.

52:41.324 --> 52:45.895
How long have you been here?
What is this place?

52:52.602 --> 52:54.470
I don't think she gets out much.

52:57.575 --> 52:58.941
Fuck-- shit.

52:58.943 --> 53:00.643
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

53:00.645 --> 53:01.710
Promise.

53:01.712 --> 53:03.179
Everything's locked!

53:09.319 --> 53:12.354
What the hell is going on here?

53:12.356 --> 53:16.692
If you're family, you can't
leave.

53:19.262 --> 53:20.863
Wait, did you see a kid
come in here?

53:20.865 --> 53:23.365
Have you seen my brother miles?

53:37.380 --> 53:39.415
Please, I need to find
him. Have you seen him?

53:39.417 --> 53:40.716
Have you seen anyone?

53:40.718 --> 53:42.384
There's a car out front!

54:25.495 --> 54:27.763
Oh, my god, Logan!

54:27.765 --> 54:29.832
Fuck this! Follow me!

54:29.834 --> 54:31.367
Come on!

54:31.369 --> 54:34.370
Where are you at, buddy?

54:34.372 --> 54:38.440
No rush... I'm patient.

54:47.284 --> 54:49.818
Agh!

54:55.625 --> 54:58.360
The crawl space! Come on!

55:18.048 --> 55:20.015
Wait, did you see another girl
come through here?

55:20.017 --> 55:22.418
My friend Kim, did you see her?

55:24.087 --> 55:25.688
No, no, no, no!

55:32.529 --> 55:35.864
Jessie... Jessie!

55:38.468 --> 55:40.469
Kim?

55:43.106 --> 55:45.474
Keys! Fucking keys!

55:54.551 --> 55:58.587
Agh! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

55:59.689 --> 56:01.056
There's somebody in there!

56:09.099 --> 56:10.766
Fuck.

56:17.073 --> 56:19.808
Fuck... me.

56:32.088 --> 56:33.922
Where's that lady?

56:38.928 --> 56:41.730
I told you not to leave.

56:41.732 --> 56:45.067
I locked the door behind me.

56:45.069 --> 56:48.704
I just wanted to see
the new family.

57:00.850 --> 57:03.952
Stop playing around.
Get rid of them.

57:59.042 --> 58:01.243
Logan.

58:47.557 --> 58:50.225
What the hell is this?

58:56.599 --> 58:57.966
Oh, my god.

59:12.949 --> 59:14.950
Sick fucks!

59:22.625 --> 59:24.860
I'm gonna get you out of here,
okay?

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.411
Oh, my god!

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:50.912
Oh, my god! You're--

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.748
don't worry about me,
go get your brother.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.283
Are you sure? Okay.

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.933
Miles!

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.071
Hello? Hey!

01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:17.839
Hey, hey, hey!

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.676
Hey, hey, hey! I'm in here!
Miles.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:22.110
The big guy locked me in here...

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:23.779
But I think they have Kim
in the next room.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.681
Okay, I'm gonna get you out
of here, okay?

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:28.183
Jessie, just be careful!

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:35.323
Jessie? Jessie?

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.297
Kim?

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:17.933
No, shit, shit.

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.402
What?

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.842
We're as surprised as you.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:02.811
When my son chooses a girl...

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:07.349
She usually doesn't come
straight to us.

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:15.824
What the hell are you
doing to me?

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:19.194
Don't worry, it's not enough
to hurt you.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:21.463
The dosage is intermittent.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:25.801
You'll drift in...
You'll drift out.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:33.041
It's up to you to decide
what's real or not.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.890
You're sick. Both of you.

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:29.364
He wants you to know,
he's not gonna hurt you.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.333
You're family now.

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:04.666
My, uh, my boyfriend,
he surprised me...

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:08.436
Took me on a road trip up north.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:11.306
It was so beautiful.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:16.645
That was before he cheated
on me and... broke my heart.

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:25.120
You wouldn't do that, right?

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.590
Break my heart?

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:48.009
You want me, right?

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.946
I can be family.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:54.149
My friends, they can--
they can just go home.

01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:58.586
And you can let Kim go, right?
Because you have me now.

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.672
I would feel so much more
comfortable...

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:20.308
Without these straps on.

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.093
Oh, thank you so much.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:47.635
I, um, I could do so much more
with both my hands free.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:04.552
Oh, my god, I thought
I'd never see you again!

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:06.688
You're okay!

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.097
Oh, thank you!

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.068
Why don't you show me more?

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.404
More of the pictures
that you like of me?

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:26.274
On the computer... show me.

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.137
Oh, my--!

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:01.443
Why are we stopping?
That was Jessie screaming!

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.497
There's another girl up there.
We have to help her, too.

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:33.174
You would have been really
good for Jessie.

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:37.312
I'm sorry this had to happen.

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:42.216
What?

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:43.785
Kim?

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.345
Don't come any fucking closer!

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.185
Ssh.

01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:22.924
Kim... Kim!

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:25.727
Thank god... Kim.

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.465
Believe me when I say this...

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.868
I'm sorry.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:10:00.728
Oh, daddy, she's--
she's okay, come on.

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:07.462
This will be your bedroom.

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:13.268
We only just started. I wanted
you to feel comfortable.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.740
I admit, I told a little lie.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:21.976
I didn't catch the blonde
with my boyfriend.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:24.545
Hell, I don't even
have a boyfriend.

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:27.949
I wonder why.

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:32.587
Jessie, you're perfect
for my brother Edward.

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:35.323
All the others...
They don't fit like you do.

01:11:35.325 --> 01:11:38.826
And we're so alike, you and I.
You know that, right?

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:43.498
What we had tonight...
Was real.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.067
You were family
before you even came here.

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:49.637
So, tonight at the club,
that was...

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.439
All just part of your plan?

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.907
Mm-hm.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:11:59.580
<i> Kim</i>
<i> my father picked me up.</i>

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:07.455
It's not my fault. Her brother
just dragged along.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.857
If you let me go--
shut up!

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:16.931
<i> Kim</i>
<i> I didn't want miles or Logan</i>
<i> involved.</i>

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:19.334
I made my father promise
to get you another night.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:23.871
You act like this is normal,
you fucking psycho!

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:25.740
I am not yours to take!

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.977
<i> Kim</i>
<i> we wanted to bring you home.</i>

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:31.913
You didn't have to put up
such a fight.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:34.015
You weren't supposed
to follow me.

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:36.918
I'm sorry I wasn't as dumb
as the others.

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:46.461
Well, it doesn't matter anymore.
You're the only one left.

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:51.766
What? Where's my brother?

01:12:56.071 --> 01:13:03.678
I-- I guess that makes us even.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:07.815
What?

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.421
Dad?

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:17.625
Dad, what happened?

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.862
What happened?

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.832
My boy--

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:28.836
oh, my god!

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:31.539
Damn it! No!

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:34.642
You do not deserve to be loved!

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:37.812
That <i> freak...</i> That you call
a brother...

01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:40.515
I would kill him again
in a heartbeat.

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:45.753
Do you really want
to hurt her, dad? Huh?

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.955
Get her parents
and bring them here!

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.862
Oh, my god! Daddy! Daddy!

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:56.964
Come on, let's go!

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:07.208
How are you okay?

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.110
Don't stop! Come on, come on!
Go faster!

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.779
I'm trying, miles!
Go faster, Jessie!

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:26.060
Just-- just run!
Just go get help!

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:29.163
No!

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:34.936
You were supposed to be family!

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:45.146
I was trying to save you
from those people you hate!

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.228
I like my family the way it is.

01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:42.637
Hey, miles?
Hey.

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:46.641
Thanks.

01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:47.808
You're welcome.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:51.012
Wait, where's-- where's Logan?

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:55.816
Oh, Jess, I'm sorry.

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:59.720
Oh, shit, I am in pain.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:02.023
No, I know. It's okay.

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:08.663
What's funny?

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:10.898
Did you ever find your phone?

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.100
Let's not-- let me enjoy it.

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:17.238
I'm too heavy.

01:16:20.677 --> 01:16:21.676
Oh, fuck.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:22.810
You're supp--

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:15.062
Jessie?

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:21.102
Mom, what's going on?

01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:24.205
How long have I been home?

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:26.807
Come here, honey.

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.782
It's okay.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:46.694
Don't fight, Jessie, please.
It'll only make it worse.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.796
No!
