we're trying things,</i>

- [Man] Hi.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.408
Hi, I'm naima, I'm
playing Natalie.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.290
- How are you doing?
- Hello, good. How are you?

01:51.314 --> 01:53.178
- Good. Welcome to set.
- Thank you.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.414
Mark and Jay wanted to
talk to you before...

01:55.416 --> 01:57.149
Yes, of course. I
wanna talk to them.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.118
- Oh, thank you.
- Read this.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.120
- And you don't get anything.
- Yeah.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.321
I feel like all
dentists are like that.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.655
- Hi, guys. Hi. Sorry.
- Hey.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.290
- Hey. Jay. Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

02:05.292 --> 02:06.892
Naima. "Nima," if you
can call me that.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.174
Naima, thank you for being here.

02:08.198 --> 02:09.895
We loved your tape,
it was awesome.

02:09.896 --> 02:13.265
Oh, thanks. I'm so glad. I'm such
a big fan of you guys. I'm...

02:13.267 --> 02:14.933
Yeah, I'm just
honored to be here.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.368
We're huge fan of yours. How's life?
What's going on?

02:16.370 --> 02:18.770
You know, I've been up
all night, just kinda...

02:18.772 --> 02:19.771
Getting ready for this.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.140
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.008
- We're kind of like... -[Jay] We're
pretty easy about everything.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.843
We can totally get something.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.845
- Hey.
- Oh, hello, geniuses.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.046
[Mark] Hi, sweetheart.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.328
These guys are
Lindsay and kamal.

02:29.352 --> 02:30.883
- Kamal.
- Naima. You can call me nima.

02:30.885 --> 02:32.050
- Hey. Lindsay.
- Nima.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.519
Uh, welcome to the set.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.354
[Kamal] So we were talking and
doing the scene yesterday.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.544
- It just felt a little...

02:36.556 --> 02:37.756
It was different. - Yeah.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.691
- It would be great to block.
-[Jay] it was fuckin' incredible.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.360
With the onion rings,
don't you think?

02:41.362 --> 02:42.694
- I know it's just like a prop...
- Onion rings?

02:42.696 --> 02:44.329
Yeah, I think there was
onion rings in the scene.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.797
It was kind of
specifically noted.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.432
- Oh.
- I don't even remember.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.201
[Mark] I think we just learned maybe
the onion rings aren't that important.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.836
- [Laughter]
- Right, yeah.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.438
This is the first time in life
that onion rings aren't important.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.373
[Laughter]

02:54.375 --> 02:55.908
- Right.
- [Mark] Yeah, yeah.

02:55.910 --> 02:59.211
<i>There were a number of people
who wanted to talk to you.</i>

02:59.213 --> 03:00.612
<i>Nobody wanted to talk to me.</i>

03:00.614 --> 03:01.880
<i>Yes, they did.</i>

03:02.816 --> 03:05.651
[Lindsay] And I think
there were, you know,

03:06.554 --> 03:09.288
a lot of different
things going on tonight.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.256
Tell me one... What
was the most...

03:11.258 --> 03:12.424
Who was the cutest guy?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.793
Okay. I know before we
had the whole thing,

03:14.795 --> 03:17.315
where I was like, you were pumped
that they went to the gay club.

03:17.339 --> 03:20.165
It was a first time thing, but,
clearly, things have changed,

03:20.167 --> 03:22.901
and maybe less about
the onion rings?

03:22.903 --> 03:25.304
[Mark] Yeah. I think the
thing to remember is that

03:25.306 --> 03:27.406
kamal is crushed
when he comes in,

03:27.408 --> 03:30.576
and you need to respond
organically to that energy

03:30.578 --> 03:32.978
and let go of the old
version of the scene.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.379
I thought that...

03:34.848 --> 03:36.548
All it took was me

03:37.585 --> 03:39.818
to know I was gay,
and then I'd be gay.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.787
But I don't know how to talk to anyone.
I don't...

03:41.789 --> 03:42.754
Are you gay?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.156
No, I think there were...

03:44.158 --> 03:45.991
- Yeah.
- [Naima] Yeah.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.628
Yeah.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.363
Okay, let's pause
for a second, guys.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.298
- We're gonna pause real quick.
- We're gonna just come in real quick.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.833
[Lindsay] Still rolling.
Still rolling.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.736
Well, just, while, like... Um...

03:57.738 --> 04:00.339
- Lindsay.
- Yeah, when Lindsay is going to touch him,

04:00.341 --> 04:02.774
if she makes it more clear...

04:02.776 --> 04:04.409
- Right.
- That she's hitting on him.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.844
[Jay] It's not really about her.

04:05.846 --> 04:09.281
Your soulmate is coming undone
and you're here for him.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.749
- Yes.
- Yeah, right?

04:10.751 --> 04:14.286
And the more you can just be an
empathetic, open human being

04:14.288 --> 04:16.221
that is receiving emotion,

04:18.926 --> 04:20.459
that's all we need.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.741
-[Jay] He's in a great spot, so once...
-[Mark] Okay, okay.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.101
[Mark] Everybody good? Let's
get quiet on the set.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.536
And, naima, you're
just chilling.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.472
How many have you put down?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.274
[Jay] I don't know, but
it is double figures.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.541
[Mark] Yeah!

04:36.543 --> 04:38.463
[Jay] Onion rings without
the onion in the middle.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.711
That's the worst part.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.648
[Mark] The onion is where all
the calories are, by the way.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.716
I swear it's the secret spot.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.819
Hi. How's it going?

04:47.821 --> 04:48.553
Hey, what's up?

04:48.555 --> 04:49.755
Is it okay if I join you guys?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.023
Yeah. Of course, yeah.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.358
Ah. [Clears throat]

04:55.362 --> 04:57.362
Sorry it was a little
intense in there.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.231
- No.
- Yeah.

04:59.233 --> 05:02.801
I mean, it's just... It's hard to get
everyone on the same page, you know?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.070
Especially when it feels
like a little forced.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.672
Mm-hmm.

05:06.674 --> 05:10.075
I really feel like
with kamal and, uh...

05:10.077 --> 05:11.677
- Lindsay.
- Lindsay, right.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.039
It's just that we have very
different acting styles, I think.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.347
We could, you know... That's...

05:15.349 --> 05:17.482
Talk about process and
styles and stuff like that.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.284
I mean, at the end of
the day, you know,

05:19.286 --> 05:21.586
we're happy with what
they're giving us,

05:21.588 --> 05:23.155
- and it works for us.
- You are? Okay.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.490
[Mark] I mean, all I can say is,

05:25.492 --> 05:29.127
Jay and I were part of a
writers room one time,

05:29.129 --> 05:31.229
and we got some notes
on our scripts,

05:31.231 --> 05:32.964
and we went in and...

05:32.966 --> 05:36.735
We told our showrunner for
an hour why he was wrong,

05:36.737 --> 05:41.340
and why everything he was
telling us was idiotic.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.576
And it didn't really
go well for us.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.611
And we now realize that
we were probably being

05:46.613 --> 05:49.114
a little defensive and a little
scared, and that's okay.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.350
I mean, we've kind of
realized that a lot of times

05:51.352 --> 05:52.632
when you feel
scared or whatever,

05:52.656 --> 05:56.088
you're actually right on
the precipice of, like,

05:56.090 --> 05:57.889
an emotional breakthrough.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.894
Yeah, I'm not...

06:05.265 --> 06:06.331
I feel good.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.801
[Stuttering] I feel
okay, um, about it.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.873
[Indistinct conversation]

06:23.617 --> 06:24.983
[Naima] I had never been
on a set like that,

06:24.985 --> 06:26.905
'cause, like, on commercials,
it's not like that.

06:26.907 --> 06:29.407
But, like, the way that Mark and
Jay work, it was like very...

06:29.409 --> 06:31.022
It was so collaborative
right away.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.192
It just made me feel like, "oh, this
is what it's supposed to be like."

06:34.194 --> 06:35.594
Do you feel good about it?
Like...

06:35.596 --> 06:37.996
Yeah. I feel great about it.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.598
Do you think I look okay?

06:40.134 --> 06:41.299
Yeah, you look fine.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.661
Have you been talking
to this girl?

06:42.685 --> 06:44.803
Yes, we've been texting.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.738
Saw each other on the
Internet, and you know...

06:46.740 --> 06:47.706
Right. Naturally.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.268
Of course. I mean,
it's all in the hopes

06:49.270 --> 06:51.190
of getting into some kind
of relationship, right?

06:51.214 --> 06:53.879
But then, you wonder, like, "who
did they actually vote for?"

06:53.881 --> 06:56.001
- You know, are they...
- Please don't bring up the...

06:56.025 --> 06:57.099
What?

06:57.100 --> 06:58.660
Like, the world is
going in the shitter.

06:58.662 --> 07:01.222
You don't wanna talk about what's
actually happening in the world?

07:01.246 --> 07:02.187
Not on my first date

07:02.189 --> 07:03.077
-with this girl
that I'm hopefully

07:03.089 --> 07:03.989
gonna like.
- Do I have a rule book?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.858
Can you give me a check book of
what I'm supposed to talk about?

Are you ready to party?

07:47.367 --> 07:48.433
Okay.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.969
I have to bring
this young lady up.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.904
She's always bringing
her ass in here,

07:52.906 --> 07:54.206
wanting to sing with us.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.474
She's from Spain.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.876
I'm gonna let her do
this one damn song.

07:57.878 --> 08:01.346
And her name is Sergio.
With an "o."

[Cheering]

08:09.923 --> 08:11.089
Hi.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.593
This is my first song I've
written all in english.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.628
And it's the first time
I'm gonna sing it to you.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.463
So I'm, like, a
little bit nervous,

08:18.465 --> 08:20.298
but I think it's
gonna be so cool.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.666
I hope you like it.

Andre, do you think
that's working?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.604
Uh...

08:59.606 --> 09:01.573
Oh, she's the only one.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.509
- You are the truthful girl.
- Yes, I am.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.944
Thank you so much.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.446
It's very hard to have friends
that tell you the truth.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.016

I'm Stevie nicks.

You like that?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.526
Okay, I'm gonna
come down right now

09:21.528 --> 09:22.861
and kiss you.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.629
Oh, no!

09:24.631 --> 09:26.097
We have a date.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.033
Should we do it?

23:52.899 --> 23:54.598
That's the truth.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.837
So it's just new for
me, that's all.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.473
But that doesn't mean
I don't wanna try.

24:03.756 --> 24:05.876
You know, I felt finally free
for a second last night.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.212
Like I was actually
being myself.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.980
And I just wanna do that.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.550
So when you feel free,
you just run away?

24:13.386 --> 24:14.652
I have, yeah.

24:15.521 --> 24:18.522
- Will you do that again?
- No.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.124
- Promise?
- Yes.

24:23.262 --> 24:24.462
Promise?

24:24.997 --> 24:26.130
I promise.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.601
Okay.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.071
- Okay?
- Yeah.

24:37.543 --> 24:38.943
It's just eight o'clock.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.111
I arrived at...

24:41.881 --> 24:43.180
Near 7:00 P.M.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.715
Mm-hmm.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.016
Okay.

24:47.453 --> 24:50.721

24:52.391 --> 24:54.892

- Hi, hi.

25:23.990 --> 25:24.989
What's that?

25:24.991 --> 25:26.657
It's a song that...

25:26.659 --> 25:29.527
This is the song I want
to sing in the showcase.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.928
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.565
Just... you play piano?

25:35.301 --> 25:36.367
Not really, no.

25:36.369 --> 25:37.635
You were playing the piano.

25:37.637 --> 25:38.936
I was just touching it.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.438
You have to help
me with this song.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.907
I know you can. I've heard you.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.441

this song for me.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.163
Okay.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.845
Both of us together,

No, you. Just you.

your real name?</i>

28:32.211 --> 28:32.976
Yeah.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.578
Why did your mom
name you Sergio?

28:34.580 --> 28:36.814
She wanted a boy,
but I was a girl.

28:36.816 --> 28:40.751
And then she thought, "okay, I'm gonna
keep Sergio in the middle name."

28:40.753 --> 28:42.953
- Hmm.
- And when I was a kid,

28:42.955 --> 28:47.024
and I wanted to have
Susanna's attention,

28:47.793 --> 28:49.093
I took a shit.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.517
- My shit was little shit,

28:50.529 --> 28:51.962
because I was a kid. - Sure.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.697
And then I put this little shit,

28:53.699 --> 28:55.399
because my shits
were like this...

28:56.769 --> 28:58.809
Yeah, and you cut it up like
a sausage or something?

28:58.833 --> 28:59.670
Like a sausage.

28:59.672 --> 29:01.238
So I put it on the floor

30:02.501 --> 30:04.401
You are so beautiful.

30:08.741 --> 30:11.575
You're so, so...

30:14.814 --> 30:16.547
So beautiful.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.556
Say it.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.526
Shout it.

30:31.163 --> 30:34.364
Shout it to the fucking moon.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.335
I can't.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.469
Yeah, you can.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.371
Say it to her.

30:42.208 --> 30:45.042
- You have to say it with me.
- Yeah.

Stop it!

31:00.165 --> 31:01.725
The first time I
discovered masturbating

31:01.727 --> 31:03.527
was on a sheepskin rug.

31:03.529 --> 31:07.297
I would, like, rub up on it while
looking at myself in the mirror.

31:08.801 --> 31:10.634
I did the same with pillows.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.769
- With pillows?
- Mm-hmm. With my cousin.

31:12.771 --> 31:16.306
But then, her boyfriend
came and saw us.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.141
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.144
Is your boyfriend still there?

He's still there.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.083

31:35.361 --> 31:37.861
[Naima] So my friend
had her third kid.

31:37.863 --> 31:40.197
And I was like, "how can
you still be having kids?"

31:40.199 --> 31:42.833
It's like, you know the world
that you're birthing them into.

31:42.835 --> 31:44.801
I just think it's
really selfish.

31:44.803 --> 31:50.240
This is the kind of stuff you were
telling these ladies at the bar. Why?

31:50.242 --> 31:52.309
[Naima] Why would
somebody have ten kids?

31:52.311 --> 31:54.044
This thing is born
into the world,

31:54.046 --> 31:55.879
and it's, like,
ruining their lives.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.614
And they just pretend slowly

31:57.616 --> 31:59.082
- stop.
- That it doesn't...

32:00.519 --> 32:01.919
Okay.

32:03.522 --> 32:04.911
- Don't you think every

32:04.923 --> 32:06.323

going to be starving.

So, what we can do till now?

32:12.598 --> 32:13.830
Get depressed about it?

32:13.832 --> 32:15.352
I think I feel more
connected to people

32:15.354 --> 32:17.114
when I feel like we're
both on the same page.

32:17.138 --> 32:19.803
I think you depress people when
you're talking about that.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.805
So I'm not supposed
to depress people?

32:21.807 --> 32:23.273
I'm supposed to, like...

32:23.275 --> 32:24.755
- Make 'em happy?
- What do you think?

32:24.779 --> 32:26.543

I'm reading the news,

depressing thing after another.

to turn into a soldier,

door one day and is like,

32:37.425 --> 32:39.489
"it's over. Here's your weapon.
Let's go."

32:39.491 --> 32:40.490
And I'd go.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.258
But until then, I'm...

I'm knocking at your door.

been too long.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.530
I thought you'd changed
your number or something.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.932
No, I've just been so wrapped
up in work these days.

33:55.934 --> 33:58.535
I remember the last time I saw
you was at Jeremy's house,

33:58.537 --> 34:01.505
when we did sake bombs and then
I threw up on Cindy's jacket.

34:01.507 --> 34:05.175
You always seem to
be very sociable.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.943
I was just slutty is the truth.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.712
But it's worked out for me now.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.681
"Slutty"?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.551
Sergio, I have to get one take.

34:14.553 --> 34:18.221
Just because the boy is saying
to you you're sociable,

34:18.223 --> 34:20.357
you say you are slutty?

34:20.359 --> 34:23.493
I mean, I don't...
It's not a good movie.

34:23.495 --> 34:26.730
It's not a good movie
then why you wanna do it?

34:26.732 --> 34:27.864
'Cause I need a job.

34:27.866 --> 34:31.301
You should really do
stuff you wanna do.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.670
If not, you are just
giving these people

34:33.672 --> 34:35.672
just your talent for nothing.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.841
You are giving a
presentation of who you are.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.443
I think you should just e-mail these
guys and tell them, "look..."

34:40.445 --> 34:41.965
I can't e-mail. The
last time I told...

34:41.989 --> 34:43.580
-"you are a fucking misogynist."
- No.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.349
And just go and start
writing your own movie,

34:46.351 --> 34:48.051
telling something
you have inside.

34:48.053 --> 34:51.588
Recently when I told somebody what
I about thought 'em, I got fired.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.391
You got fired because you
said them what you thought?

34:54.393 --> 34:56.072
Yeah. And I didn't think
it was going well,

34:56.097 --> 34:57.861
so at lunch, I like,
talked to them about it,

34:57.863 --> 34:58.983
and it just did not go well.

34:59.007 --> 35:00.864
Okay, then fuck this tape.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.265
Come, e-mail these guys.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.534
- No, I have to do this tape.
- Really, I'm telling you.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.176
You should e-mail those
guys who fired you

35:06.200 --> 35:08.472
and tell them why
they are wrong.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.842
I mean, they won't
take you seriously

35:11.844 --> 35:13.543
if you don't say, "no."

35:14.146 --> 35:15.879
They fired you.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.882
They will never ever
hire you again.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.785
So, what can you lose?

35:23.455 --> 35:24.855
Yeah.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.056
- Tell them!
- Okay.

35:26.058 --> 35:28.091
So, okay. As an artist...

35:28.093 --> 35:30.460
And I'm talking
to an artist too.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.629
- As an artist speaking...
- To an artist.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.798
To other artists, because
there's two of them.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.266
Other artists.

35:36.268 --> 35:40.570
You know that the most important
is to be honest with the work

35:40.572 --> 35:42.205
the most important...

35:42.207 --> 35:44.574
I want to be...

35:44.576 --> 35:46.610
I want to work on movies

35:47.045 --> 35:48.612
that respect...

35:49.915 --> 35:51.615
- "I will make movies."
- Honesty.

35:51.617 --> 35:52.482
I will make movies.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.951
"And they will respect artists."

35:54.953 --> 35:57.187
And they will respect artists.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.256
"And then I will come
to your fucking door,

- "and knock-knock."
- And then I will... okay.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.846
"Come to your fucking
door and knock-knock"?

36:02.870 --> 36:04.394
Where does that one end?

36:04.396 --> 36:06.636
"I'm gonna come to your door
and knock, knock," and what?

36:06.660 --> 36:09.395
"And knock-knock to your
door and tell you..."

36:11.270 --> 36:13.136
Fuck you? [Laughs]

36:13.138 --> 36:15.071
- Yeah! Good!
- I mean...

36:15.073 --> 36:18.341
"I will make movies. Ones
that respect artists.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.978
And then I will come
to your door..."

36:21.980 --> 36:23.713
All caps. "Knock-knock",

36:25.150 --> 36:27.517
and say, 'fuck you.'"

36:34.126 --> 36:35.425
Okay.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.896
- Should I send it?
- Yeah.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.058
Wait, wait. No, no, no. Wait.

36:41.082 --> 36:42.699
Okay. What are you gonna do?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.381
- Record a sound. Are you recording?
- What?

36:44.405 --> 36:46.403
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.438
- [Recorder beeps]
- [Farts]

36:54.279 --> 36:55.712
Send it, send it.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.252
[Breathing heavily]

37:19.871 --> 37:21.438
It's 2:00 A.M.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.939
So what?

37:22.941 --> 37:24.741
Means we have 17 hours to go.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.278
[Naima] I once met
an older gentleman.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.347
He was, like, a
respected writer.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.816
I was a fan of his,

37:32.818 --> 37:36.219
and we started e-mailing and it
was kind of just like pen pals.

37:36.221 --> 37:37.341
And they were kind of funny.

37:37.365 --> 37:39.122
They were, like, dirty e-mails.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.057
And then I was in New York once.

37:41.059 --> 37:44.694
Told him I was there and he
wrote back right away, like,

37:44.696 --> 37:47.497
"come over to my house."

37:47.498 --> 37:50.299
He opened the door and he had this
real fake, slick air about him.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.602
And he was kind of leaning
on the door, like...

37:53.071 --> 37:54.404
"Come on in."

37:54.406 --> 37:55.972
But in that moment I realized...

37:56.842 --> 37:59.776
I had complete control
over him, you know?

38:00.879 --> 38:03.179
And I remember his kids were
sleeping in the other room,

38:03.181 --> 38:04.914
so we had to go into
the guest room.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.683
But you were there to fuck him?

38:06.685 --> 38:08.885
I didn't decide, but once
I walked in, I was...

38:08.887 --> 38:11.388
I was like, that's
what's gonna happen.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.823
- Yeah.
- Like I was there to deliver something.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.459
In exchange of what?

38:16.461 --> 38:19.529
It was like I wanted his
respect or something.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.499
But definitely
didn't get it by...

38:23.735 --> 38:25.035
Having sex with him.

38:25.037 --> 38:27.203
Yeah. Was it good?

38:27.205 --> 38:28.505
No, it was terrible.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.973
- Really?
- Yeah, it was really bad.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.408
Fuck, that sucks.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.677
He started to go
down on me and...

38:34.780 --> 38:37.881
Came up and he was like
disturbed all of a sudden.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.449
He...

38:40.319 --> 38:42.385
Pretty much said that...

38:43.288 --> 38:45.055
There is too much, like...

38:46.692 --> 38:48.091
Uh, smegma.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.793
- It's gross. It's like...
- Soft?

38:49.795 --> 38:52.162
Yeah, it's a little
like cottage cheesy.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.463
Like <i> mantequilla de pato.</i>

38:53.465 --> 38:55.065
<i>Manteqa de pato?</i>

38:55.067 --> 38:56.066
<i>Mantequilla de pato.</i>

38:56.068 --> 38:57.133
<i>Mantequilla de pato.</i>

38:57.135 --> 38:58.802
It's like duck butter.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.137
Duck butter.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.373
- Duck. Quack, quack.
- Right, right.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.015
- I like that better.
- So, what happened?

39:05.039 --> 39:06.443
He didn't like that?

39:06.445 --> 39:07.944
He didn't like my duck butter.

39:07.946 --> 39:12.515
And so he kind of like awkwardly
stood up and left the room.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.384
You should send him

39:15.387 --> 39:19.522
a box with a pint of
<i>mantequilla de pato.</i>

39:20.225 --> 39:22.359
- Just like a gift wrap?
- Yeah.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.860
A present for his kid.

39:24.396 --> 39:25.528
They can eat it.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.697
I'll say, "happy
Thanksgiving." Yeah.

39:29.334 --> 39:33.136
Duck butter for your kids.

39:35.173 --> 39:39.809
So I wanted to do a record

39:39.811 --> 39:41.578
and I had no money.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.580
So I made a deal with this guy,

39:43.582 --> 39:46.583
a very successful businessman.

39:46.585 --> 39:50.286
"You pay for my record
for three months,

39:50.288 --> 39:52.255
and then I can be
your girlfriend."

39:52.257 --> 39:53.857
That was our deal.

39:55.327 --> 39:57.794
And what'd you have
to do with him?

39:58.497 --> 40:02.031
I lived with him,
I slept with him.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.804
For three months.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.009
And at the end,

40:13.011 --> 40:15.011
he stopped paying for my record.

40:16.181 --> 40:18.581
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, I know.

40:18.583 --> 40:23.153
So I tape him
having sex with me,

40:26.992 --> 40:28.491
and then I said to him,

40:28.493 --> 40:30.994
"okay, if you don't
pay for my record,."

40:33.198 --> 40:35.465
"I'm going to show
this to everyone."

40:36.868 --> 40:37.967
So he paid.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.337
Yeah.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.640
And then you just
stopped it and left?

40:44.976 --> 40:46.009
Yeah.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.081
All right.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.527
[Sergio] What's that?

41:04.529 --> 41:05.762
[Naima] It's my face.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.665
[Sergio] I love it.

41:09.401 --> 41:11.701
[Singing in Spanish]

41:14.906 --> 41:17.874
I picture myself having
sex with a lot of people.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.509
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.377
Like, with my friends.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.746
- Mm.
- I think it's so hot.

41:23.748 --> 41:24.547
Yeah.

41:24.549 --> 41:27.717
[Singing in Spanish]

41:31.256 --> 41:32.755
[Upbeat music playing]

41:42.901 --> 41:44.634
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:44.636 --> 41:47.837
I think I've... I think
I've come too much.

41:48.306 --> 41:49.939
We'll do it again.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.643
Maybe I just need
a little break.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.678
No problem. Don't worry.

42:17.269 --> 42:18.968
You were sleeping like this.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.272
- Yeah.
- Right? Yeah.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.708
You are so sleepy.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.110
- Yeah...
- Don't worry.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.177
No, no, no.

42:29.614 --> 42:32.882
Stop it! Seriously.
Stop, stop. Stop.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.025
[Urinating]

42:48.934 --> 42:50.033
Fuck off.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.037
[Whimpers]

43:03.181 --> 43:04.347
You okay?

43:07.018 --> 43:08.885
Yeah. I, um...

43:10.388 --> 43:12.822
I don't really feel so good.
Like...

43:14.192 --> 43:16.693
I just feel a little, um...

43:18.430 --> 43:21.631
I don't know. I don't know.
[Stutters] It's just...

43:21.633 --> 43:23.399
Because of the sleep?

43:23.401 --> 43:25.935
I think it was the combination
of the sleep and just...

43:26.605 --> 43:27.637
Staying awake.

43:27.639 --> 43:29.439
I feel like I don't
have a lot, um...

43:29.441 --> 43:32.775
A lot of brain power left to...

43:32.777 --> 43:35.311
To even, like,
communicate anything.

43:35.313 --> 43:36.579
It's because of me something?

43:36.581 --> 43:38.261
It's because you're
feeling weird about me?

43:38.285 --> 43:38.881
No, no, no.

43:38.883 --> 43:40.450
But if you are, you can say it.

43:40.452 --> 43:42.452
No, that's totally
not the reason, no.

43:42.454 --> 43:43.820
What's going on, then?

43:44.422 --> 43:45.822
You know...

43:45.824 --> 43:48.691
I think it was just like, you
know, today it was like...

43:49.394 --> 43:51.794
Like, I got fired earlier today,

43:51.796 --> 43:53.429
and when I woke up...

43:53.431 --> 43:54.797
You got fired today?

43:55.300 --> 43:56.666
Yeah, this morning.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.768
This morning you got fired.

43:58.770 --> 44:00.403
'Cause you said recently.

44:04.809 --> 44:05.875
Yeah.

44:10.882 --> 44:12.649
So...

44:12.651 --> 44:14.091
You got fired and
then you came here?

44:17.756 --> 44:20.223
There was time in
between, but, yeah.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.160
You came here because
you got fired.

44:26.865 --> 44:28.564
No, that's not the
reason why I came here.

44:28.566 --> 44:29.766
Yeah.

44:31.536 --> 44:32.869
It is.

44:33.371 --> 44:34.404
No.

44:36.140 --> 44:37.140
No, it's not...

44:37.142 --> 44:38.975
[Stammers] It's not like...
I mean...

44:38.977 --> 44:41.778
I found out this morning...

44:43.615 --> 44:45.081
I think you should go.

44:46.718 --> 44:48.284
- Now.
- Yeah.

45:17.982 --> 45:20.783
[Stomping]

46:43.835 --> 46:46.202
[Dog scratching]

47:17.735 --> 47:19.402
[Gentle music playing]

47:49.801 --> 47:51.934
[Yawning]

47:53.805 --> 47:55.538
This will cleanse us.

48:01.312 --> 48:03.246
Why do we have to
stay up all night?

48:03.815 --> 48:05.581
- We have to.
- Yes.

48:06.451 --> 48:07.950
Are you close with your mom?

48:09.053 --> 48:11.354
Yeah. We talked every day.

48:12.055 --> 48:13.055
Yeah?

48:13.057 --> 48:15.191
- She's coming.
- What?

48:15.193 --> 48:16.893
She's coming for the showcase.

48:16.895 --> 48:20.930
So I have to have breakfast
with her tomorrow.

48:21.532 --> 48:22.765
- Oh, no.
- Today.

48:22.767 --> 48:24.433
Right.

48:24.435 --> 48:27.136
We were supposed to go
to the seven tomorrow.

48:27.138 --> 48:28.971
What do we do? Do
we break the...

48:29.774 --> 48:30.907
Oh.

48:31.509 --> 48:32.942
I don't know.

48:32.944 --> 48:35.478
You will be there
in the showcase?

48:36.214 --> 48:38.314
Promise? Okay?

48:39.517 --> 48:40.683
[Naima] Of course.

48:43.821 --> 48:45.955
Susanna, when I was four,

48:45.957 --> 48:47.823
we were in the street,

48:47.825 --> 48:51.127
and I said to her that
I wanted normal mom.

48:51.129 --> 48:54.030
And she said to me, "okay,
just go and find her."

48:54.032 --> 48:56.632
And she left me in the
middle of the street.

48:56.634 --> 48:58.167
When you were four?

48:58.169 --> 49:01.938
I spent the whole afternoon
trying to find the way back home.

49:02.607 --> 49:05.074
And then a neighbor found me.

49:05.076 --> 49:07.143
And my mom said to me,
"did you find her?"

49:07.679 --> 49:08.978
And I was like...

49:11.649 --> 49:15.952
And she said, "good, because I
don't want a normal daughter."

49:16.921 --> 49:19.188
She said, "I don't want
a normal daughter"?

49:19.190 --> 49:20.222
Yeah.

49:20.491 --> 49:21.657
Whew.

49:23.928 --> 49:25.328
How about your mom?

49:26.965 --> 49:29.465
She's pretty like...

49:29.467 --> 49:34.003
Kind of strong, loud lady
from the middle east.

49:34.005 --> 49:35.404
She came over,
like, in the '70s.

49:35.406 --> 49:37.707
But I got along
better with my dad.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.110
Why?

49:41.179 --> 49:44.347
She didn't really like the
way that I was like...

49:44.349 --> 49:48.351
Kind of a tomboy in school and...
I don't know.

49:50.188 --> 49:52.621
Are you angry with her?

49:52.623 --> 49:54.890
I think I have a lot of anger
with her, but I, like...

49:54.892 --> 49:57.093
Have you talked about
that with her?

49:57.428 --> 49:58.428
No.

49:59.797 --> 50:01.530
Yeah, but that's inside.

50:01.966 --> 50:03.666
This anger is there.

50:04.702 --> 50:06.135
For a time.

50:08.673 --> 50:10.106
Have you done meditation?

50:10.108 --> 50:11.107
No, I haven't.

50:11.109 --> 50:12.641
It kind of freaks
me out, you know.

50:13.211 --> 50:15.011
- You do it?
- Yeah.

50:15.013 --> 50:17.413
When I'm getting
anxious, like...

50:17.415 --> 50:18.781
[Hyperventilating]

50:18.783 --> 50:20.449
Like an anxiety attack,

50:20.451 --> 50:23.953
I start thinking like a
river is crossing over me,

50:23.955 --> 50:27.390
and I start describing
this river, and then...

50:28.393 --> 50:33.696
I try to change the
river into a new river.

50:33.698 --> 50:34.897
How is your river?

50:34.899 --> 50:36.532
- My river is so brown.
- Oh, it's so chunky.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.254
- It's brown...
- Yeah, I got brown, chop...

50:38.278 --> 50:40.250
All the time, during that,
coming out of my...

50:40.252 --> 50:42.071
Yeah, it's loud, it's choppy.

50:42.073 --> 50:43.539
[Exhaling deeply]

50:48.612 --> 50:49.612
Okay, sit up.

50:49.614 --> 50:51.747
Okay, you have your
mom in front of you.

50:51.749 --> 50:53.215
- Okay, yeah.
- Just tell her

50:53.217 --> 50:57.386
all the shit you wanna
make sure she knows.

50:57.388 --> 51:02.491
Susanna, you're fucking crazy
leaving me at four years old

51:02.493 --> 51:03.626
in the fucking street.

51:03.628 --> 51:05.327
You're a fucking crazy mom.

51:05.329 --> 51:06.329
For example.

51:06.697 --> 51:07.697
Okay.

51:10.034 --> 51:12.935
I think you're really angry

51:12.937 --> 51:14.270
about how your mother was to you

51:14.272 --> 51:15.604
and you take it out on me.

51:15.606 --> 51:18.207
And you're just a
mean, stupid bully

51:18.209 --> 51:21.210
who teases your
innocent daughter.

51:21.212 --> 51:22.711
Just go and tell her things.

51:22.713 --> 51:24.380
I think you're jealous of me.

51:24.382 --> 51:27.750
And that's why you're just
talking to me every fuck...

51:27.752 --> 51:29.912
- You have to keep going.
- Right, right, right. Sorry.

51:31.956 --> 51:33.923
I think you don't take
care of yourself.

51:33.925 --> 51:36.025
- Yeah.
- You're super unhealthy

51:36.027 --> 51:37.693

real estate years ago,

53:34.445 --> 53:36.845

sister a house.

53:36.847 --> 53:38.948
Are you judging me for
having such a nice house?

53:38.950 --> 53:40.783
[Sergio] No, I want it for me.

53:41.385 --> 53:42.818

53:43.487 --> 53:45.888
It's a painting my dad did.

53:45.890 --> 53:47.423
[Sergio] It's depressing, right?

[Naima] I don't know.
I kinda like it.

53:48.929 --> 53:51.060
I don't understand how
can you live with this.

53:51.062 --> 53:52.261
I know, but I feel bad.

53:52.263 --> 53:54.063
Like, my dad would feel
sad if it was gone.

my dad over again.

Ah! Well...

01:04:01.905 --> 01:04:04.840
One thing I was thinking about,

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.308
you know, I belong
to a generation,

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:09.211
we grew up without aids
and all these things.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:12.881
We could allow ourselves a lot
of things that these days

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:14.950
young people cannot do.

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:17.018
And you know I'm
a mediterranean,

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.555
and there is this tradition in
the mediterranean countries

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:22.057
that in the spring

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:26.595
everybody used to gather in
the fields and just fuck.

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:30.432
They thought that that was
what made the earth grow.

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:36.004
And I like to keep that
tradition alive, you know.

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:40.041
- Mm.
- Sex is so enjoyable.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:45.013
And I think the reason why
is that it's so impersonal.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.481
It's not like love, you know.

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:49.684
Like, you don't have to be
picking up and, "I need you."

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:52.387
No. It's more free.
