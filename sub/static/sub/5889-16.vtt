WEBVTT

00:21.880 --> 00:23.723
Give me your cash and your supply.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.486
It's bad enough you people have
to live in my country...

00:26.640 --> 00:30.042
...you have to cut into my business too.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.531
You don't sell...

00:32.720 --> 00:34.290
...in this neighborhood.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.086
All right?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.083
Arkan knows that.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.930
You have 30 seconds to give up
your stash before he kills you.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.684
He's going to kill me anyway.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.641
Give it up...

01:00.200 --> 01:01.531
...and you have my word...

01:01.680 --> 01:03.682
...that you'll leave here with your life.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.646
Understand?

01:07.760 --> 01:09.171
Understand?

01:09.320 --> 01:10.924
All right?

01:12.200 --> 01:14.248
Where? Where?

01:34.640 --> 01:39.965
There. You said I could walk
if I gave you what you wanted.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.210
I told you...

01:42.360 --> 01:43.930
...that you'd live.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.170
I didn't say...

01:46.560 --> 01:48.210
...that you'd walk.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.400
You know what that is?

02:05.520 --> 02:07.204
Looks like a bullet.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.600
It's your bullet.

02:09.320 --> 02:12.529
Forensics team pried it
from the floorboards of the Phoenix.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.684
Ballistics matched it
to your FBI-issued 9 mm.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.006
There's more.

02:19.200 --> 02:24.127
The crime lab found trace amounts
of blood belonging to Samuel Aleko.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.646
- Here's the report. See for yourself.
- Why show me this?

02:27.800 --> 02:31.327
Because it contradicts every word
out of your mouth since you walked in.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.529
Because at a minimum,
it is direct evidence of your perjury...

02:34.680 --> 02:38.162
...and I'm trying to decide if it should
be exhibit A in your murder trial.

02:38.320 --> 02:42.803
You made it very clear you never saw
Samuel Aleko on the Phoenix.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.486
I suppose shooting the man
must have slipped your mind.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.967
I sat right here
and told you exactly what happened.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.761
Maybe Wilcox is fabricating evidence
to support his case.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.445
You know my record, Agent Keen.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.331
There's no love lost between me
and the federal government.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.284
That said, I do recognize that exceptional
measures are sometimes required...

03:01.440 --> 03:03.442
...to preserve our security.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.561
Talk to me.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.881
Enough lies.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.169
I see.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.843
Well, in that case,
you really leave me no alternative.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.810
I can't shield your actions
in the name of national security...

03:19.960 --> 03:22.531
...if you insist on concealing the truth
of those actions.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.247
I did not kill Eugene Ames.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.722
- That's the only truth you need to know.
- A jury may feel differently.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.770
And something tells me
we're about to find out. We're done.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.241
I'll issue my ruling in the morning.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.525
Die Entrechteten. Really, Aram.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.763
These misanthropes have been
on my radar for years.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.605
- The FBI must have some kind of file.
- No. We do.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.445
I'm just finalizing some translations.
Just a few more seconds.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.921
I'm sorry.
I admit I don't quite follow this plan.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.170
Agent Keen is facing an indictment
for a murder she didn't commit.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.130
I found us a lead
on the whereabouts of the one man...

03:58.280 --> 04:02.126
- Tom Keen.
- Wait, what?

04:02.280 --> 04:05.250
Tom Keen is dead.
He was shot and killed months ago.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.210
No. Agent Keen shot him,
but she didn't kill him.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.729
In what may be Agent Keen's
single greatest lapse in judgment...

04:12.880 --> 04:16.964
...she saved the imposter pretending
to be her devoted husband...

04:17.120 --> 04:21.841
...opting, instead, to hold him captive
in the rusty hull of an abandoned ship.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.240
- Tell me you made that up.
- The harbormaster found Tom.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.365
He was gonna go to the police,
so Torn killed him to keep Liz from prison.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.965
- That is...
Insane?

04:30.160 --> 04:32.367
I was going to say "extremely romantic."

04:32.520 --> 04:35.922
if we can bring Tom back and get Denner
to realize that Tom killed Ames...

04:36.080 --> 04:38.321
...then maybe we can
still stop Liz's indictment.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.403
Okay. Here we go.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.369
According to our assets in Dresden...

04:42.520 --> 04:46.320
...you are looking at the leadership
structure of Die Entrechteten.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.960
What the hell does that mean?

04:48.040 --> 04:49.530
"The disenfranchised."

04:49.720 --> 04:54.806
They may look like common street thugs,
but don't underestimate their authority.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.089
They're racists masquerading as patriots.

04:58.240 --> 05:03.371
"Germany for Germans." On the surface,
they're all about anti-immigration...

05:03.520 --> 05:07.650
...preservation of the Aryan race,
but look a little deeper...

05:07.800 --> 05:11.202
...and you'll find
they care far less about white power...

05:11.360 --> 05:13.089
...than they do about white powder.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.449
- They're drug dealers?
- Among the most ruthless in Europe.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.571
Somewhere along the line, they realized
that keeping German neighborhoods...

05:20.720 --> 05:23.485
...white is more than politics.
It's economics.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.165
They're fighting a street war.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.722
Interpol estimates a dozen drug-related
homicides in the last year alone.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.281
Tom Keen,
the four-eyes who taught third grade...

05:31.440 --> 05:33.602
...is walking into that?
- How do we find him?

05:33.760 --> 05:36.730
I can check, but I don't think
we have any friends on the inside.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.325
I do.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.284
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.520
She's my partner. You might need help
from this side of the law to clear her.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.967
You open your mouth, Donald,
and hay flies out.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.249
You look and feel and smell like cop.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.846
You are what you are. It's admirable.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.447
But this is my world,
and you're a tourist.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.650
You blink wrong, we are both dead
and your partner goes to prison.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.051
I'll keep my mouth shut
and stay out of the way.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.001
What's going on?

06:06.160 --> 06:09.767
Agent Ressler and I were
just discussing travel arrangements.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.605
- What are you doing here?
- We found Tom.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.242
We're gonna make him come back.
Tell the judge that you're innocent.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.401
Can we talk?

06:19.800 --> 06:23.043
- What are you doing?
- Whatever it takes to keep you safe.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.283
Finding Tom will not keep me safe.
I lied to the court.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.843
We can handle a perjury count.
It's the murder charge I'd like to avoid.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.243
How? Judge Denner's right.
I covered it up.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.324
At the very least,
I'm an accessory after the fact.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.527
Listen to me. Juries care about intent.

06:41.680 --> 06:45.890
You didn't intend to kill the harbormaster.
That was Tom's decision.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.566
Right now,
that judge may think you're guilty...

06:48.760 --> 06:52.685
...and it's not easy
to let a cold-blooded killer go free...

06:52.840 --> 06:58.085
...even in the name of national security,
but a cold-blooded killer you are not.

06:58.240 --> 07:03.007
If we can prove Tom is responsible,
it might just tip the scales.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.925
It's my fault.
I never should've put him there.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.368
He'll go to prison
for the rest of his life because of me.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.763
- One step at a time, Lizzy.
- He's not gonna come back.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.767
He Will.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.447
This journey we're on isn't over just yet.

07:19.600 --> 07:24.447
You may have given up on us,
but I haven't.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.123
- Ruddiger.
- Oh!

07:41.720 --> 07:44.564
- I heard the good news.
- Good news? I'm in rehab.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.645
Heh-heh. Precisely.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.646
It requires a great deal of courage
and intestinal fortitude...

07:50.800 --> 07:54.282
...for a man to take
that first step toward sobriety.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.206
- I couldn't do it myself.
- It was court-ordered.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.647
I got drunk and crashed
my daughter's Passat.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.370
She'll never speak to me again.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.525
What's the ninth step, again?
You make amends to those you harmed?

08:07.280 --> 08:08.486
What do you want?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.891
You do any business
with Die Entrechteten?

08:15.040 --> 08:20.524
No, but I do know others who have.
Arms dealer name of Kohl.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.684
Splendid. Perhaps you could put me
in touch with him.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.205
You best try a Ouija board.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.801
He was assassinated.
Shot dead in his car.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.760
They do business now
with an Austrian. Becker, I think.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.207
Since when did a pack of stuempers
like Die Entrechteten get access...

08:35.360 --> 08:38.886
...to military hardware?
- Word is they recruited a new boy.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.604
They're looking
for F2000 machine guns.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.604
- You know where or when?
- No.

08:46.200 --> 08:50.091
But if you wire some cash into my patient
account, they'll let me use the phone.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.321
I'll ask around.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.446
- Thank you, Max.
- Yeah.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.570
And remember, one day at a time, pal.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.046
Ah.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.803
So the man we're looking
for is a Franz Becker?

09:01.960 --> 09:03.928
The holiest man I've ever seen.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.447
- What church?
- Heh. God, no.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.241
I mean, he is literally covered in holes.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.161
Every square inch of the man is pierced.
It's impressive.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.011
That's who you think
Tom reached out to?

09:17.200 --> 09:19.248
That's who I would reach out to.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.485
Unfortunately,
Tom and I share some propensities.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.324
Whatever you think you know
about Tom Keen, forget it.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.724
The bookish elementary-school teacher
was a masterful illusion.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.841
The man is an extremely talented
covert operative.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.083
I'm not surprised he convinced you
that his persona was real.

09:45.720 --> 09:50.601
Once he takes on a new identity,
he convinces himself.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.563
Down! On the ground!

10:09.560 --> 10:11.600
This shipment is being seized
by order of the BMI...

10:11.640 --> 10:14.041
...on suspicion of trafficking
in contraband weapons.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.762
What is in the shipping containers?
Answer me!

10:21.640 --> 10:22.641
Wool gowns.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.690
Women's dresses.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.041
I told you, Giftzwergen!

10:51.240 --> 10:52.571
Women's dresses, huh?

10:54.160 --> 10:56.003
Yes, Jeff, I understand.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.528
You're my financial planner,
but I'm not asking for your advice on this.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.484
I just need you to do it.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.563
Jeff, of course I know
it's a lot of money.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.611
Thank you.
You have the routing number?

11:09.760 --> 11:12.570
No, I want the account closed
and the money transferred today.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.609
Thanks again.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.806
Sir, I was just coming...

11:19.680 --> 11:21.330
I perjured myself.

11:21.480 --> 11:25.451
I told the judge that you were on that ship
for official business, under oath.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.962
I've crossed my share
of lines in this job...

11:28.160 --> 11:30.606
...but I always told myself
that wouldn't be one of them.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.001
Of course you know that.
You were counting on it.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.969
I made it clear that I would not lie.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.804
I ordered you not to put me
in that position...

11:36.960 --> 11:39.611
...and you intentionally did exactly that.
- I'm sorry, sir.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.167
- I never wanted...
- That is exactly what you wanted.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.483
Grow up. You wanna play the angles?
Leverage friends and colleagues?

11:45.680 --> 11:47.045
Have the decency to admit it.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.204
I'm not sorry for what I did.
But I am sorry that it had to be done.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.725
I wanted Berlin dead.

11:51.880 --> 11:56.204
I wanted him to pay for what he did.
To Meera, to you, to all of us.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.926
I brought Tom to that ship for us.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.880
I don't regret it, and I'm not gonna
lay down and quietly go to prison for it.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.884
Can you even hear yourself?
You held another human being captive.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.408
You set in motion a chain of events
that cost an innocent man his life.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.324
It wasn't right. It wasn't necessary.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.245
It was a crime way outside the lines
of what we stand for.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.371
I came in here to say
that I don't recognize you anymore.

12:18.520 --> 12:22.320
But after what I did today, the truth is,
I don't recognize myself.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.606
Sir, you're bleeding.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.810
Are you all right?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.361
I'm fine.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.770
Oh, sir.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.290
I need help in here!

12:37.720 --> 12:39.245
So it's ink now.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.121
My goodness, Franz.

12:42.320 --> 12:48.248
As if you hadn't found enough ways
to decorate that pink hide of yours.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.686
Hello, Red.

12:49.840 --> 12:54.402
You know, Freud hypothesized
that tattoos are a defense mechanism...

12:54.560 --> 12:58.360
...a way of externalizing
some internal trauma.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.601
So tell me, what secret pain
are you hiding beneath...

13:02.800 --> 13:08.842
...that already crowded exterior?
- Dude, I just like tattoos.

13:10.760 --> 13:15.129
I thought perhaps it had something to do
with that recent snafu at the airport.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.523
I heard about what happened
with your shipment.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.682
Give us a moment.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.165
What do you want, Red?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.963
A quiet place next to a lovely stream...

13:32.160 --> 13:34.891
...where I can watch things float by.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.241
Someday.

13:37.920 --> 13:41.447
But I do have a certain sway
with the appropriate German authorities.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.490
I can get your shipment released
from customs.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.247
This is very kind of you.
What's the catch?

13:48.400 --> 13:50.767
In exchange for getting
your weapons released...

13:50.920 --> 13:53.048
...I keep 35 percent of the shipment.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.966
- A transaction fee.
- Red, those weapons aren't mine.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.724
They're earmarked for a client.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.362
I'm about to close with another broker
to replace the shipment.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.764
- That'll cost you dearly.
- I'm supposed to make delivery tonight.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.526
And those aren't the kind of guys
you wanna piss off.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.803
My evening's wide open.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.522
And there's nothing I appreciate more
than customer service.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.364
It appears we're partners, Franz.

14:18.520 --> 14:24.243
So just sit back and let that tattoo dry
or set, or whatever it is tattoos do...

14:24.400 --> 14:27.882
...and I'll handle the negotiations
on our behalf.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.730
Dr. Harper. I'm Agent Keen. I was
with Cooper when he was brought in.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.080
- You were present for the seizure?
- That's what it was?

14:40.120 --> 14:42.885
- He seemed fine, and then his nose...
- Liz. My God.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.769
- Charlene.
- What are they saying?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.809
This is Dr. Harper.
This is Mrs. Cooper.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.611
Mrs. Cooper, your husband's
being evaluated as we speak.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.491
- Is he conscious?
- I'm afraid not, but it's still early.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.450
Your husband experienced
a rather significant seizure...

14:55.600 --> 14:58.365
...that may be due to his condition,
or his condition exacerbated...

14:58.520 --> 15:00.682
- ...by a high level of stress.
- He was with me.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.161
We were arguing.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.685
But he's okay?

15:04.880 --> 15:06.325
I mean, he will be okay?

15:06.480 --> 15:11.725
Mrs. Cooper, I wish I could be more
specific, but as I said, it's still early.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.084
Where is the Austrian?

15:15.240 --> 15:16.730
He's late.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.486
Relax. He'll be here.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.687
If this goes wrong...

15:20.840 --> 15:22.046
...neither of us...

15:22.200 --> 15:25.204
...will live to regret it.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.846
You see? You worry too much.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.489
I'll get Elias.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.130
Good evening.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.130
What the hell are you doing here?

16:04.280 --> 16:06.203
I know you were expecting
Franz Becker.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.291
But Franz and his men ran into some
unexpected turbulence at the airport.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.602
Turn your car around
and get out of here.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.762
I can't do that. Elizabeth is in trouble.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.287
Are you listening?
You're gonna get us all killed.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.683
She's about to be indicted
for the harbormaster's murder.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.162
- You need to come back with us.
- That's not happening.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.645
Tell her she's on her own.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.330
Is there a problem?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.650
You're damn right there's a problem.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.361
Elias, my name is Raymond Reddington.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.201
At the risk of sounding immodest,
perhaps my reputation precedes me.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.125
- Reddington. I know who you are.
- Wonderful.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.487
Here's the problem as I see it.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.881
You were expecting
a shipment of weapons...

16:52.040 --> 16:54.441
...from an Austrian dealer
named Franz Becker.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.889
Unfortunately, that shipment was
recently seized by the Bundespolizei.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.687
If you'd like to have your men confirm
before we proceed, I won't be offended.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.251
Let's assume I believe you.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.846
Let's assume, also,
you're going somewhere with this.

17:07.040 --> 17:12.046
I am. It turns out dear Franzie's
the subject of a BMI investigation.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.362
That's ridiculous. Franz is clean.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.171
You ordered guns from a trafficker...

17:17.319 --> 17:20.767
...who has been under heavy surveillance
for the last two months.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.170
I'm offering the same goods
for the same price.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.810
I don't like this.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.201
I'm listening.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.689
There is, however,
one small matter to tidy up first.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.888
This one,
he brokered the deal with Franzie.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.931
He has exceptionally poor judgment.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.124
He's working
with the German authorities.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.328
I'm not enamored with either scenario.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.720
Elias.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.086
He's lying.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.164
And him? He looks like a cop.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.685
Because I am a cop.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.291
He's not just a cop.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.048
He's with the FBI's Counterterrorism
Task Force, and he's on my payroll.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.680
How do you think we know
your guy's under investigation?

18:00.840 --> 18:02.200
- Elias...
- Give him to me.

18:02.320 --> 18:06.644
I'll bleed him for whatever intelligence
he has and then eliminate the problem.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.451
Or maybe I just take him out back
and shoot him.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.080
Fine. That works for me.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.369
If Franz is
under investigation, he put him there...

18:15.520 --> 18:18.603
...so he can get a cut of the deal.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.208
We gotta go after him.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.886
No. We came to deliver a message,
and we have.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.403
See? That's why we got the insurance.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.050
Dembe?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.086
Brad? Brad?

18:58.280 --> 19:00.806
I told you she was guilty.
She's getting ready to run.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.201
- What is this?
- Keen closed one of her accounts.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.567
She moved all the money offshore
an hour ago.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.688
It's not illegal to close an account.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.730
What's illegal is monitoring
her financials without a warrant.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.651
Main justice wants to shut down
our murder investigation...

19:13.840 --> 19:15.683
...and we have to play by the rules?
- We do.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.451
You wanna solve this, Marty,
but you're taking it personally.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.171
She knows she'll be indicted.
The money's leaving the country...

19:21.320 --> 19:23.561
...and Agent Keen is leaving
right behind it.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.291
- Ressler.
- Give me Reddington.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.726
It's him.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.164
You know, they say you can judge
a man by the company he keeps.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.403
Do you have any idea
what you just did? I was in.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.609
Yes, and now you're out.
You didn't seem inclined...

19:55.760 --> 19:58.161
...to leave your new friends willingly,
so I improvised.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.845
I was on assignment.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.207
- I had a contract.
- Circumstances change.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.521
Think, Tom.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.166
I'm the one who told you to go
and never come back...

20:06.320 --> 20:08.971
...so for me to be responsible
for your return...

20:09.120 --> 20:11.487
...you must know
I don't have a comparable option.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.688
- No, I am not going back.
- She'll be indicted.

20:13.840 --> 20:17.208
Not just for perjury,
not just for obstruction, for murder.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.131
The local authorities think
she killed the harbormaster.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.971
- She's going to prison.
- I'm the reason she's not there.

20:23.120 --> 20:27.523
- That harbormaster was calling the cops.
- Yes, but that's all beside the point.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.330
You know what to do, Tom.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.962
Are you gonna let a crime
you committed to protect Elizabeth...

20:33.120 --> 20:36.010
...be the reason she goes to jail?
- Like you care.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.007
- What does that mean?
- You are using her.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.367
You have been using her
from the very beginning.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.650
You need her on the outside so you can
keep your little task force up and running.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.610
I'm glad we had this talk.
I know you'll do the right thing.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.366
Listen to me. I am gone.
Lizzy did this to herself...

20:51.560 --> 20:55.804
...when she threw me in that hole.
I am not going down. Not for her.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.405
And sure as hell not for you.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.322
- Any word?
- Mm-mm.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.370
- You really don't have to stay.
- Well...

21:15.120 --> 21:18.442
Charlene, the last thing
I wanna do is pry...

21:18.600 --> 21:22.605
...but Dr. Harper mentioned his condition.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.407
Harold's a private man.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.088
Harold has a brain tumor.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.527
Glioblastoma, it's called.

21:43.680 --> 21:47.890
Doctors found it last year when he was
admitted after being attacked.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.647
They suggested
that he leave the Bureau.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.088
Any undue stress could exacerbate
his illness.

21:55.240 --> 21:58.722
But Harold, that... That job...

21:58.920 --> 22:02.322
...it means everything to him.
- I'm so sorry.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.891
I had no idea.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.044
The original prognosis
was less than a year.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.808
But we found
this experimental trial program.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.041
By some miracle,
Harold was accepted.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.921
They were giving him
some new chemotherapy drug.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.964
We thought it might be working...

22:23.120 --> 22:26.169
...but after today...

22:27.280 --> 22:29.521
...I'm not so sure.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.890
Liz, you can't say anything.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.923
Please promise me.

22:36.120 --> 22:41.524
Harold is so proud, the idea that you
and the others feeling sorry for him...

22:41.680 --> 22:44.286
No, I understand.
This stays between us.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.204
You have my word.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.003
Thank you.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.161
I'm collecting signatures
for a get-well card for Mr. Cooper.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.605
"Get well, bitch.
We've got some partying to do"?

23:00.760 --> 23:04.162
Too much? I just thought, I mean,
I wanted to make him laugh, you know?

23:04.360 --> 23:05.521
I mean, if it's serious.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.251
- Liz called from the hospital.
- She did? And is it bad?

23:08.400 --> 23:10.846
- It's bad, isn't it?
- Apparently, he's hypoglycemic.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.843
- Low blood sugar?
- Worst-case scenario...

23:13.000 --> 23:15.731
...he's pre-diabetic. He'll be fine.
- Wow.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.011
Guess I don't need the card anymore.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.446
Did you find Tom?

23:20.600 --> 23:23.285
Yeah. Told him what was at stake.
He wasn't moved.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.444
Didn't realize you were interested
in his opinion.

23:27.160 --> 23:30.960
We were interested in his confession.
He made it clear we weren't gonna get it.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.166
So you went all that way
and you didn't bring him back?

23:44.760 --> 23:45.761
All rise.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.327
I will make this quick.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.610
This whole business started
because the Justice Department...

23:54.760 --> 23:58.162
...sought to quash a lawful subpoena
issued to Harold Cooper...

23:58.320 --> 24:01.290
...Assistant FBI Director. Miss Wright?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.522
Mr. Cooper had a medical issue,
Your Honor.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.011
He's unable to be with us.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.846
Is that right? Well, do send him my best.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.482
Let him know he's not the only one
sickened by this proceeding.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.571
For the record, I have completed
my in-camera assessment...

24:15.760 --> 24:17.683
...of the Justice Department's position.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.808
Before you continue,
may I have a word?

24:19.960 --> 24:22.361
You've made yourself amply clear,
counsel

24:22.560 --> 24:24.847
- Sidebar, Your Honor?
- Denied.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.164
On behalf of the attorney general himself,
I must insist.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.251
The attorney general?

24:32.800 --> 24:34.882
Get up here, both of you.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.370
If the attorney general is so interested
in my courtroom...

24:42.520 --> 24:44.284
...he can come tell me himself.

24:44.440 --> 24:48.684
He will. Not in person, but I've been
informed a representative will be here.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.963
- Too little, too late.
- I'm asking the court to withhold ruling...

24:52.120 --> 24:54.805
...until the AG's rep has been afforded...
- Denied.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.440
Look at my face.
Get as close as is necessary...

24:57.640 --> 25:00.564
- ...to understand what I'm saying. Denied.
- Your Honor.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.961
- What is it?
- A situation in the corridor.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.531
What the hell does that mean?

25:04.680 --> 25:08.890
There's someone out there demanding
he speak with you. He says he's the killer.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.480
I see.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.291
Well, then, I guess
you should bring him in.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.881
The officer informs me
that you have confessed...

25:37.040 --> 25:38.804
...to the murder of Eugene Ames.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.644
Tom?

25:40.800 --> 25:42.245
Yes.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.645
- And you are?
- My name is Tom Keen.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.001
Mr. Keen.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.730
I'm so relieved.
Somebody told me you were dead.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.640
Your ex-wife said you were dead.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.764
She shot you in self-defense
when you abducted her for Berlin.

26:08.960 --> 26:13.284
- She saved me.
- She held you captive on the Phoenix...

26:13.440 --> 26:16.011
...to squeeze you for intelligence
about your employer.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.969
Yeah, look. None of that matters.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.726
The only thing that matters
is that I killed that man.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.043
- Wrong ship, wrong time.
- So you snapped his neck, just like that.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.124
No. Took a few seconds.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.449
Why are you telling me all this?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.048
You do realize what's going
to happen to you...

26:34.200 --> 26:35.804
...as a result of your confession today.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.764
I don't care what happens to me.
I came here for her.

26:40.160 --> 26:44.802
All right, I need you to know that
Elizabeth Keen would never have hurt...

26:46.480 --> 26:49.927
- I don't even remember his name.
- His name was Eugene Ames.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.807
I killed Eugene Ames without Liz's help.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.248
In fact, she tried to stop me.
She begged me not to do it.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.807
Hey, I just saw Charlene.
She said it was okay.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.166
Come in.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.528
From Agent Mojtabai.
Apparently, Aram thought I died.

27:11.680 --> 27:15.162
You might have if you hadn't missed
the corner of my desk on your way down.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.044
Now, about what you were saying.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.326
Our conversation.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.561
- Agent Keen...
- No.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.929
I told you I wouldn't put you
in the position where you had to lie...

27:23.120 --> 27:25.487
...and I did and I am ashamed of that.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.325
I know you believe you acted
in the interests of the task force.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.005
Doesn't justify it.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.162
I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for you.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.441
And I certainly couldn't have survived
the last year and a half without you.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.846
You're the only person in the world
I completely trust.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.126
And to hear you say
that you don't even recognize me...

27:45.280 --> 27:47.760
I'm not upset at you for changing.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.970
After what you've been pulled into,
it would be impossible for you not to.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.085
I'm just...

27:55.240 --> 27:56.810
I'm upset...

27:56.960 --> 28:00.043
...because I don't wanna see
the person that I first met...

28:00.240 --> 28:02.288
...that good person...

28:03.520 --> 28:06.126
...I don't wanna see her
get lost in all of it.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.284
The doctor is ready
to discuss the test results.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.966
You know, before today,
I would have said I had seen everything.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.771
Now I know I haven't seen a damn thing.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.968
Even if what you're saying is true...

28:23.120 --> 28:26.169
...Elizabeth still has a lot to answer for.
- Doesn't matter now.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.767
We'll see if your wife agrees when she's
serving felony time for perjury...

28:29.920 --> 28:32.048
...and facing an indictment
for kidnapping...

28:32.200 --> 28:35.329
...witness tampering, obstruction.
- You can make all that go away.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.409
Prosecution could still charge her
with murder.

28:37.560 --> 28:38.641
She didn't kill anyone.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.724
They will argue that she acted in concert.
She didn't stop you.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.645
She knew that the harbormaster
would contact the police.

28:44.800 --> 28:48.361
She wanted him to die. At a minimum,
she was an accessory after the fact.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.646
She had no intent.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.848
I was the one
who made the decision to act.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.646
Yeah, so you say.
The harbormaster would've saved you.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.290
- Why kill him?
- To protect her.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.649
The woman you spent the last two years
of your life betraying?

28:59.840 --> 29:03.049
Someone you lied to, spied on,
sold out and betrayed?

29:03.200 --> 29:06.409
A woman you married as a job?
She held you prisoner.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.925
She wasn't thinking clearly.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.209
I needed to do something,
or she would've gone to prison.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.931
You're in love with her.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.891
I won't even try to express
how twisted that is.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.526
Okay, Mr. Keen,
or whatever the hell your name is.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.365
You wanna fall on your sword
for this woman, so be it.

29:25.520 --> 29:28.330
I will recommend
that Agent Keen not be charged...

29:28.480 --> 29:30.528
...with the murder of Eugene Ames.

29:30.680 --> 29:34.765
But as to the other potential charges,
I'm allowing the grand jury to proceed.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.530
Officers.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.324
Find a seat for Mr. Keen in the pens
until further notice.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.768
Listen. I will make a confession.
I will give you a full deal.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.491
But you have to promise me
that you leave Liz out of this.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.887
- That deal won't happen.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.886
- I told Mr. Connolly you were...
- It's fine, Rosemary. Get him out of here.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.887
Well, well, well.

29:58.040 --> 30:01.442
Reven Wright said that main justice
would be sending an attack dog.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.523
You're out of your mind.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.603
I mean, the Beltway's been saying it
for years...

30:05.760 --> 30:08.206
...but you really are out of your mind.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.930
Well, in 30 years on the bench...

30:10.120 --> 30:12.726
...I've learned their bark is far worse
than their bite.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.370
Not this time.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.887
What did you do, Richard?
What the hell did you do?

30:17.080 --> 30:20.163
I conducted an in-camera hearing,
which I have every right to do.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.402
You have no right,
and you damn well know it.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.961
You're not cleared
to hear national security cases.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.203
We have a FISA court for that,
and you're not on it, period.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.364
You compelled two federal agents
to divulge national secrets...

30:31.520 --> 30:33.602
...under threat of imminent incarceration.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.081
- They violated my order.
- To hell with your order.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.847
Your order was a per se violation
of The Espionage Act, The Patriot Act.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.810
Intimidation, threats.
This is the way our government works.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.769
I'm supposed to just take your word...

30:44.920 --> 30:47.969
...that the case involves national
security? - That's right.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.885
You're a superior court judge, Richard.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.249
This case is so far over your head,
it would make your nose bleed.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.131
You intentionally accessed classified
intelligence without authority.

30:57.280 --> 31:01.285
I should have you arrested
right here and now.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.364
Smiling Tommy Connolly.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.609
You always were a smug bastard.

31:06.800 --> 31:11.283
And you were always a paranoid,
self-righteous prick.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.166
Your Honor.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.081
Here's what we do.
You're gonna quash this subpoena.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.447
- And if I don't?
- You will.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.331
In everyone's career,
there's a crossroads, Richard.

31:27.480 --> 31:32.441
A moment where what they'll say next
will define their lives.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.281
Decide their future.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.886
Is this task force
really that important to you?

31:37.080 --> 31:39.162
I don't know what that is.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.284
And neither do you.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.808
You crossed the line.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.049
I'm willing to move past it.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.805
And who knows?

31:49.960 --> 31:54.443
Maybe one day, when I'm AG,
we'll get you on a real court.

32:07.520 --> 32:10.967
it appears as if the treatment
you were receiving in the clinical trial...

32:11.120 --> 32:13.600
...has slowed the growth
of the glioblastoma.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.603
But the seizure?

32:16.480 --> 32:17.925
Chemo drugs are powerful.

32:18.120 --> 32:22.011
They have side effects.
That can include damaged neurons.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.481
My guess is
that's what caused the seizure.

32:24.640 --> 32:29.202
- It was a side effect from the medication?
- Yes. No reflection on your overall health.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.328
Which you're saying is improving.

32:31.480 --> 32:35.326
This is one test, and your husband
has a very aggressive illness.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.245
But it does appear
as if we should stay the course.

32:38.400 --> 32:42.928
You'll be discharged this afternoon. We'll
continue to monitor these side effects.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.844
All rise.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.761
Oh, sit down.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.845
The government has shown nothing but
disrespect for this court's authority...

32:52.000 --> 32:55.561
...so spare me the hollow reverence.
Let me be clear.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.883
Government secrecy, the idea
that the federal government can act...

32:59.080 --> 33:04.007
...surveil, detain, interrogate, and even
kill American citizens with no oversight...

33:04.160 --> 33:05.207
...or accountability...

33:05.360 --> 33:09.126
...with no obligation to present the people
with evidence that led to their actions...

33:09.280 --> 33:12.887
...that, in my view, is the gravest threat
to our national security.

33:13.520 --> 33:16.046
It erodes the very foundation
of our great democracy.

33:16.200 --> 33:21.286
This is a system of checks and balances
founded on a separation of powers.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.603
The fact that any federal prosecutor
who utters the magic words...

33:24.760 --> 33:29.163
...who invokes "national security," can
suppress cases, can quash subpoenas...

33:29.360 --> 33:31.408
...can avoid grand juries,
that offends me.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.883
And so...

33:36.600 --> 33:38.489
...I'm very glad that, in this matter...

33:38.640 --> 33:42.770
...the government's done the responsible
thing and complied with my request...

33:42.920 --> 33:45.890
...to review the evidence
supporting its claim.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.208
Having done so...

33:49.080 --> 33:54.291
...I am satisfied that if Assistant Director
Cooper or Agent Keen were compelled...

33:54.440 --> 33:58.206
...to testify, it would expose national
secrets and have the potential...

33:58.360 --> 34:00.886
...to do material damage
to the national interest.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.805
- Your Honor...
- Let me save you the trouble, Mr. Markin.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.440
You and I,
for all of our accomplishments...

34:06.600 --> 34:10.844
...remain rather small fish
in this deep and dark federal pool.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.206
If that point wasn't made clear
to your boss...

34:13.400 --> 34:17.324
...I'm sure it will be very shortly.
- You can't do this.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.802
A man is dead.
A lieutenant in the Metro P.D.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.610
And his death is a tragedy, sir.

34:23.760 --> 34:27.242
Agent Keen,
his name was Lieutenant Eugene Ames.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.969
Never forget it.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.521
Let the good work you do
from this day forward...

34:31.679 --> 34:33.842
...in some way be a tribute
to his memory.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.603
That's it.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.964
You have to live with that.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.920
- You know what you did.
- Marty, let's go.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.007
So that's how it is now, right?

34:48.159 --> 34:50.447
That the feds are just above the law.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.681
You know, he was a good man.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.728
Now I have to go out in that hallway...

34:54.880 --> 34:56.962
...and explain to his wife and daughter...

34:57.120 --> 35:01.728
...how there's no justice for a guy who gave
most of his life in service to this city.

35:01.880 --> 35:02.961
That's enough.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.880
Can't really blame him.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.560
He's playing a game
with less than half the pieces.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.688
Maybe it should have ended.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.928
Maybe he's right.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.764
What's gonna happen to Tom?

35:18.560 --> 35:19.971
Who?

35:20.800 --> 35:23.406
My ex-husband, Tom Keen?

35:24.320 --> 35:25.481
I never met him.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.604
There's no Tom Keen
in federal custody.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.561
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.210
It's just...

35:51.920 --> 35:53.763
We tried.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.724
We really did.

36:03.080 --> 36:06.402
Missed you in court today, Harold.
I hope everything's all right.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.206
You made it all disappear.
Just like that.

36:10.480 --> 36:11.970
Hey, think of it this way.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.721
Most Americans would kill
for that kind of job security.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.688
I didn't think you knew everything
about our little task force.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.084
Learn something every day.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.126
I was serious when I said
I'd be the next AG.

36:27.280 --> 36:30.363
I've been briefed on Reddington
and a handful of other things...

36:30.520 --> 36:34.047
...I instantly wished I didn't know,
but that's the gig.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.363
I'm starting to think maybe
the gig is getting old.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.841
- So am I.
- No.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.525
You don't mean that.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.724
Maybe you're a little dinged up...

36:44.880 --> 36:47.486
...but you're still at the top
of your game.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.206
You perjured yourself
for one of your team.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.249
I admit I didn't expect that.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.928
But I sure as hell do respect it.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.845
Guess my principles
aren't what they used to be.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.526
- Neither are yours.
- That's where you're wrong, buddy.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.606
I never had any principles.
