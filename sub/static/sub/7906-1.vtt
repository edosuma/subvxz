02:15.969 --> 02:18.460
<i>In related news,</i>
<i>local woman Becky Roberts... </i>

02:18.538 --> 02:21.632
<i>has been missing now</i>
<i>for more than 24 hours... </i>

03:11.224 --> 03:12.816
Is anyone there?

03:28.608 --> 03:29.870
Hi.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.168
Hi.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.775
Where is everyone?
In the assembly.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.879
So why aren't you?
Why aren't you?

03:40.620 --> 03:43.418
I'm a transfer,
I just got here.
I know.

03:44.257 --> 03:47.351
Is it that obvious?
It's a small school.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.418
Word travels fast.

03:49.495 --> 03:52.623
So what's the assembly for?
Major drama.

03:52.699 --> 03:55.691
Some townie
was screwing the wrong guy
and she's gone missing.

03:55.768 --> 03:59.295
So the police are here
to teach us
about personal safety.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.536
Like, don't talk
to strangers.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.372
I'm Owen.

04:06.446 --> 04:07.845
Dodger.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.212
That's unique.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.747
Blame my mom,
she's a Dickens scholar.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.880
And your dad?
Let's just say
he's not a scholar.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.190
So where'd you come from?
England.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.794
I meant
what was your last school?
Bradford.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.061
Before that, Collegiate.
Webster before that.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.761
So what'd you do?

04:30.470 --> 04:34.736
I was dating this girl
who happened to be
the dean's daughter.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.975
Miss Allen.
Miss McNally.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.410
Since you seem
to have skipped the assembly,
perhaps detention...

04:42.482 --> 04:45.246
I'm sorry,
Miss McNally, is it?
Uh-huh.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.546
I'm Owen Matthews
and this is my fault.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.952
It's my first day
and I asked Miss Allen here...

04:50.023 --> 04:51.650
if she could show me
the way to my dorm.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.124
Not that I would ever set foot
in the boys' dorm.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.787
No, just to the dorm's
front entrance.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.390
Fine, but as soon
as you finish
showing Mr. Matthews around...

05:00.466 --> 05:03.162
make sure you contact
your RA and he'll help you...

05:03.236 --> 05:04.828
I'll do just that.

05:04.904 --> 05:07.099
Thank you for your help.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.534
I guess
you're stuck with me.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.205
<i>Mr. Matthews,</i>
<i>your son is on line 1.</i>

05:42.408 --> 05:44.205
Send him to voicemail,
Cynthia.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.268
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Charles Matthews... </i>

05:46.346 --> 05:47.506
<i>I'm away from my desk</i>
<i>right now. </i>

05:47.580 --> 05:50.811
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>and I will return</i>
<i>as soon as possible. </i>

05:52.085 --> 05:55.543
Hey, Dad, just wanted
to let you know
that I'm all settled in.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.646
The bus worked out fine...

05:57.790 --> 06:00.350
though it would have been nice
to have seen you
before I left.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.155
I got a great
work-study shift...

06:02.228 --> 06:04.696
<i>as a teaching assistant</i>
<i>in the Physics Department. </i>

06:04.931 --> 06:06.558
<i>And I signed up for classes. </i>

06:06.632 --> 06:09.328
<i>Mostly hard sciences,</i>
<i>per your request. </i>

06:10.002 --> 06:11.833
<i>And I just met my roommate,</i>
<i>Tom. </i>

06:11.904 --> 06:13.667
I just beat off.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.871
<i>Great guy. </i>

06:16.209 --> 06:18.439
Well, I guess that's it, so...

06:19.112 --> 06:21.808
you know, give me a call
if you have some time.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.475
I hope
you washed that hand.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.619
We're sneaking out.
Good for you.

07:02.221 --> 07:05.384
Do you want to come?
Why would I want to do that?

07:11.063 --> 07:13.258
Dodger asked me to bring you.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.065
Where are we going?

07:24.343 --> 07:27.039
The old chapel,
Westlake tradition.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.707
To do what? Bible study?
To play a game.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.386
What up!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.258
Party's here.
Over here in the locker room.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.762
No, I'm glad they're here.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.264
What's going on, man?

07:46.332 --> 07:48.732
I thought you were missing,
like that townie.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.795
Tom, who's your
new boyfriend?

07:52.872 --> 07:54.772
You'll have to excuse
Randall here.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.469
He doesn't know the difference
between a roommate
and a cellmate.

07:58.578 --> 08:02.674
Everybody, this is Owen.
Owen, this is everybody.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.048
Jungle Fever,
you guys want to join us?

08:06.118 --> 08:07.483
What's wrong, Graham?

08:07.553 --> 08:09.248
Bad mood 'cause
you blew the physics test?

08:09.322 --> 08:10.584
I don't know, Lewis.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.419
Bad mood because
Mercedes blew
the lacrosse team?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.686
Blow this.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.159
I hate to be the bitch here,
but are we going
to play or what?

08:16.229 --> 08:18.527
Come on, Regina,
you love to be the bitch.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.192
All right,
everyone put your money in.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.361
Is someone gonna tell me
how to play?

08:26.806 --> 08:28.467
It's a lying game.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.133
The object:
Avoid suspicion.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.942
Manipulate your friends.
Eliminate your enemies.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.280
Have a seat.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.980
I'm going to secretly pick
one person in the group
to be a liar.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.318
The wolf.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.385
And everyone else
is a sheep.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.597
If you can find the wolf...

08:51.764 --> 08:54.699
and convince
the rest of the group
to vote him out...

08:55.101 --> 08:56.864
then the money is yours.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.905
The wolf survives,
the cash is theirs.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.271
So how do we find the wolf?
Figure out who's lying.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.072
Who's Dodger looking at?
I'm thinking Texas T!

09:06.145 --> 09:07.237
What?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.541
Dude, you will never borrow
my car again.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.015
Then as much as I'm sure
I'm going to miss
the PT ragtop...

09:12.084 --> 09:13.847
I thought that I heard
Tom move when Dodger...

09:13.920 --> 09:15.353
was walking around
to mark the wolf.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.389
All right, Randall,
that an official accusation?

09:17.456 --> 09:18.718
And if it is?

09:18.791 --> 09:21.191
Then you can only send home
the accused or the accuser...

09:21.260 --> 09:22.727
but you can't win
if you don't play.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.160
So let's vote.
That's right.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.788
And the defense?
No, I'm not the wolf.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.355
No, I swear to God
I'm not the wolf.

09:27.433 --> 09:30.231
I swear on the Gold Star State
I'm not the wolf.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.736
Come on,
are you gonna listen to me...

09:31.804 --> 09:33.635
or are you gonna listen
to this chump here...

09:33.706 --> 09:36.072
whose buddy list reads
like a sex-offenders registry?

09:36.142 --> 09:37.166
What?
Come on!

09:37.243 --> 09:39.268
Show of hands,
who thinks Tom's the wolf?

09:39.345 --> 09:40.676
No!

09:40.746 --> 09:42.873
You guys, come on.
No.

09:42.949 --> 09:44.974
And Randall, our accuser?
Yes!

09:45.051 --> 09:46.643
Yes!
All right.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.517
Come on, we need one more
for the majority, guys.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.557
One more for the majority.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.421
O- Dog, help a brother out.

09:53.492 --> 09:56.086
Listen, just 'cause
you're Tom's new bunk-buddy...

09:56.162 --> 09:57.652
doesn't mean
you got to be his bitch.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.823
You don't really think
the angry homophobe thing...

09:59.899 --> 10:01.594
is fooling anyone, do you?

10:05.638 --> 10:07.765
Come on, Randall,
you know the rules.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.104
Show the group
if you've got the mark.

10:11.143 --> 10:12.440
Tell me I'm rich.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.105
No mark.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.411
I guess
Randall's not the wolf.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.575
Watch your back,
pretty boy.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.616
Dude, you know
how gay you sound?

10:23.422 --> 10:24.582
Blow me, Tom.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.922
Have a nice walk.
Bye.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.693
Nighty-night, sheep boy.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.127
You guys all suck!

10:31.197 --> 10:32.664
Poor baby.

10:32.732 --> 10:36.190
The wolf has survived.
Who wants to start round two?

10:38.170 --> 10:40.229
Dodger felt up
the new guy.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.367
She did ask me
to bring him here.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.308
What a whore. Let's vote.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.403
Hey, I believe
I'm allowed a defense.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.877
Whenever someone lies,
they normally have a tell.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.745
Like my new friend,
Graham, over here.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.182
That's the most retarded thing
I've ever heard.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.483
And there it is.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.753
Haven't you guys realized
he can't open his mouth...

11:01.827 --> 11:03.124
without taking a swig?

11:03.195 --> 11:05.595
So?
It's empty.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.235
Graham, you can't convince us
if you can't
convince yourself.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.999
You would've noticed it
if you didn't know
each other so well.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.870
Are we voting or what?

11:15.941 --> 11:18.603
One vote for Owen.
And the accuser?

11:24.417 --> 11:27.215
The new guy gets to stay
and I have to go?

11:32.124 --> 11:34.354
I cannot wait
to go to college.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.089
Bare it and share it,
Graham.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.394
Have fun
with your new recruit.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.328
He's just pissed
'cause he's fat.
I can still hear you!

11:50.176 --> 11:52.940
So was he the wolf?
Money's still on the floor.

11:53.145 --> 11:55.375
Who wants to start
round three?

12:06.058 --> 12:08.959
All right, this is it.
It's one vote for Owen.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.155
Who's it going to be, Lewis?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.991
Say good night, Mercedes.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.169
Congratulations, baby.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.707
Tonight, you could've
gotten laid. But instead...

12:26.946 --> 12:28.538
you got fucked.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.356
Not bad
for your first day.

12:40.526 --> 12:43.154
Yeah, I guess it's one way
to pay for college.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.129
You think
you're that good?

12:45.197 --> 12:47.665
No, it's just bored rich kids
make it so easy.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.098
They're like
bickering siblings.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.534
They turn on each other
for no good reason.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.129
Graham's tell, come on.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.932
You're awfully quick
to judge.
No, it's just that...

12:58.010 --> 13:00.877
Those bored rich kids
are my friends.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.016
...over 38...

13:42.087 --> 13:44.078
Is this journalism class?

13:44.156 --> 13:47.023
Are you Owen Matthews?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was...

13:47.092 --> 13:50.789
Sleeping in.
No, my alarm clock...

13:50.863 --> 13:52.262
Relax, Owen.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.931
If being late
is the worst thing...

13:53.999 --> 13:56.365
that happens to you
in the first week,
you got off lucky.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.131
Take a seat.
As I was saying...

13:59.872 --> 14:02.466
does a reporter
just go for the story?

14:02.908 --> 14:05.809
Or can we, as the media,
cover a tragedy like this...

14:05.878 --> 14:08.779
with both sensitivity
and respect?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.748
Morning, Randall.
Laura?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.477
What does that mean?

14:12.551 --> 14:15.247
That means, if I may...

14:15.487 --> 14:19.184
that if you upon some
nasty pictures of the victim
on the Internet...

14:19.258 --> 14:21.021
don't forward them
to the whole school.

14:21.093 --> 14:25.427
A resounding no to sensitivity
and respect from Mr. Hodge.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.657
Feet down.

14:31.136 --> 14:34.594
You just now discovering
the Internet, Owen? Match. com?

14:39.645 --> 14:41.044
Mr. Matthews...

14:41.113 --> 14:44.082
you're making it very hard
for me to pretend
that I can't tell...

14:44.149 --> 14:46.276
you're not paying attention.

14:59.531 --> 15:03.023
I'm going to need
these articles by this Friday,
at the latest.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.093
Now if any of you
are having a hard time...

15:05.170 --> 15:07.161
thinking of something
to write about other than...

15:07.239 --> 15:09.366
the most recent development
in this local tragedy...

15:09.441 --> 15:12.239
I'd be willing
to meet with you privately.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.443
And they only just found
that girl this morning...

15:20.519 --> 15:23.113
because her body was dragged
through the woods by a wolf.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.019
Yeah. Listen, the guy
blew her head off...

15:25.090 --> 15:26.717
then let the wildlife
just go to town.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.225
Why does it have to be
a guy?

15:28.294 --> 15:29.818
Please.
Serial killers
are always men.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.328
Just the ones
that get caught, baby.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.126
Serial means
more than one, jackass.

15:33.198 --> 15:36.326
You're not taking
your SAT book to my lake house
this weekend, are you?

15:36.402 --> 15:39.030
Right, Owen, my dad...
The senator.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.902
The senile drunk,
is sending a limo
to take us all...

15:41.974 --> 15:43.373
to the lake house
on Friday.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.376
Nobody ever stays here
on the weekends.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.706
You in?
Yeah, sure.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.804
I'm not going to be able
to make it, I got plans.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.940
What?
By plans you mean
herpes, right?

15:51.016 --> 15:53.541
Actually, by plans,
I mean I'm going...

15:53.619 --> 15:56.349
to State tomorrow
to see the sweet Jenny Ryder.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.117
It's Wednesday.
I know.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.523
And I'm declaring my own
"Randall Gets Laid"
Holiday Weekend.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.618
And I'm going to punch
Miss Ryder's v card...

16:04.763 --> 16:05.889
Nice.
Thank you.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.592
Can I borrow your car?

16:08.334 --> 16:09.995
Yeah, man.

16:10.869 --> 16:14.532
Yeah, just, you know,
leave the keys
on the tire and...

16:15.207 --> 16:17.334
don't get any blood
on the back seat.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.706
I wouldn't dream of it.

16:18.777 --> 16:22.076
Actually, I would like this
to be special, you know.

16:23.048 --> 16:26.211
Like, in the middle
of the woods,
up against a tree.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.775
You're a pig.
You're a dyke.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.343
Die a violent death.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.480
Yeah well,
if that's your technique...

16:32.558 --> 16:35.152
I weep for Jenny Ryder.
I bet you do.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.019
So are we going
to play the game
before the weekend?

16:38.097 --> 16:39.826
Not sure I want to.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.200
Well, what else
are we going to do
around here, study?

16:45.104 --> 16:47.538
Owen had a decent point
last night.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.365
About us knowing each other
too well.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.736
It's so incestuous.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.778
So you just want to stop?
Because of the new guy.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.871
Thank you.
Not necessarily.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.540
Well then, what?

17:01.286 --> 17:03.516
We'll play
with the whole school.

17:04.323 --> 17:08.054
They're the sheep,
and we're the wolves.

17:09.461 --> 17:12.089
I don't think they'll all fit
in the chapel.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.259
Let me ask you a question.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.165
What's the best way
to play the game?

17:18.237 --> 17:20.728
Lie your ass off.
Defend your honor.

17:21.306 --> 17:23.103
Accuse your neighbor.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.005
Exactly.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.645
Nobody knows
who killed that girl.

17:28.781 --> 17:32.615
So why don't we
make an accusation?
So what are you suggesting?

17:34.887 --> 17:38.220
Let's convince them
the murderer is on campus.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.621
And he's just getting
started.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.159
All right.

17:45.330 --> 17:48.595
But how do we do that?

17:59.645 --> 18:01.840
You guys
have no imagination.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.749
It's like
you're playing checkers.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.918
And I'm playing chess.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.394
I had fun last night,
thanks for the invite.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.400
Who said I invited you?
I thought Tom said.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.871
Relax, I'm kidding.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.936
I wanted to apologize, too.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.806
I didn't mean to piss
on you guys with that bit
about the tells.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.278
Sure, you were just trying
to impress me.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.974
What makes you say that?

18:37.049 --> 18:39.449
Well, I just...
Relax, I'm kidding.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.218
So, I had an idea
on how to convince
the rest of the school...

18:44.289 --> 18:46.052
there's a murderer on campus.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.524
I'm listening.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.318
What if this
isn't a random murder,
but a serial killer.

18:50.395 --> 18:51.760
You already lost me.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.424
Let's just say
someone forwarded us
an e-mail.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.333
About not one,
but a series of murders
that happened before.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.426
Go on.

18:58.504 --> 19:01.996
And the first victim died
in identical fashion
to our townie.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.666
So it's happening again.

19:03.742 --> 19:06.438
Why else would the police
be investigating Westlake?

19:06.678 --> 19:09.272
They're not.
Telling the student body.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.016
It would be our duty
to warn them.

19:20.392 --> 19:22.292
Meet me in the library.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.662
We're going to create
a killer.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.332
He needs a name.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.101
The Wolf?
That works.

19:31.603 --> 19:34.868
Okay. What else does every
good mass murderer have?

19:35.474 --> 19:36.907
Something that he wears.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.170
Something
that covers his face
but anyone can buy.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.111
Pantyhose?
What? Is he robbing a bank?

19:44.216 --> 19:46.912
My old roommate,
he used to go hunting.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.718
He had one of those
neon ski masks.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.881
Orange doesn't exactly
inspire fear.

19:51.957 --> 19:55.085
Come on, it's the new black.
Okay.

19:55.894 --> 19:57.919
There are plenty of
deer hunters around here.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.123
Give him a camo jacket, too.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.525
What's his weapon
of choice?

20:03.902 --> 20:05.870
Well, the girl was shot.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.232
Yeah, but a knife
would be scarier.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.277
Don't get me wrong,
I love
the phallic imagery...

20:12.344 --> 20:14.335
but serial killers
rarely change their M.O.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.041
But don't you see?
This is his pattern.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.118
Remember this is not
the first time
our boy has struck.

20:20.185 --> 20:23.382
Of course, he goes
from campus to campus.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.082
Following the exact
same plan.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.088
The first death
is always a townie.
Which is just a warning shot.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.388
Before he attacks
the school.

20:29.461 --> 20:32.021
And the massacre begins.
On the full moon.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.930
That's this weekend, right?
It's Halloween.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.529
It's so obvious.
It's perfect.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.339
So who were
the original victims?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.732
So the first person killed
was obviously the town slut...

20:44.810 --> 20:47.244
shot in the face
while lost in the woods.

20:47.312 --> 20:49.542
Okay. Who's next?

20:49.615 --> 20:52.175
What if the Wolf
waited for his prey
in the back seat of a car?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.946
What if you were
any more cliché?

20:54.019 --> 20:55.919
Like you can do better.

20:56.455 --> 20:58.389
Dark hair, brown eyes.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.815
<i>Killed while</i>
<i>looking in the mirror. </i>

21:00.892 --> 21:03.087
<i>A victim of</i>
<i>her own narcissism. </i>

21:03.595 --> 21:06.723
That means conceited.
Anyone else?

21:06.898 --> 21:10.493
Self-mutilating de-virginizer,
eviscerated in the chapel.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.628
No, it should be special
for him.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.538
<i>Lock up the misogynist pig</i>
<i>and let him bleed to death. </i>

21:16.675 --> 21:18.074
<i>Right after castrating him. </i>

21:18.377 --> 21:19.935
<i>Very slowly. </i>

21:20.012 --> 21:22.071
Can the Wolf do
microscopic surgery?

21:24.616 --> 21:27.176
Laugh it up, drama boy.
You're next.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.910
<i>Prima donna wannabe actor</i>
<i>trying to play</i>
<i>the big balcony scene... </i>

21:30.989 --> 21:32.923
<i>gets his intestines</i>
<i>ripped out. </i>

21:35.761 --> 21:38.252
Who else?
Let's not forget
the campus queen.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.364
<i>Her sharp wit was dulled</i>
<i>when she choked... </i>

21:41.433 --> 21:42.991
<i>on her own severed tongue. </i>

21:44.603 --> 21:47.504
You people
are deeply unwell.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.130
Four years in the same place
with the same people.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.937
What do you expect?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.272
Last but not least.

21:55.347 --> 21:58.043
<i>The good guy that fell</i>
<i>for the bad girl. </i>

21:58.684 --> 22:00.311
<i>Died of a broken heart. </i>

22:01.386 --> 22:04.048
I didn't know you were
such a romantic, Randall.

22:04.122 --> 22:07.285
I'm not.
But I do love the irony.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.393
We'll get this out tonight,
leaving plenty of time...

22:17.469 --> 22:18.800
for the rumors to spread.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.428
Lights out.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.803
If I get caught
in the boys' dorm again...

22:22.874 --> 22:24.967
Yeah, that hasn't happened
since we hooked up, huh?

22:25.043 --> 22:27.034
By hooking up,
you mean jerking off...

22:27.112 --> 22:28.909
to my yearbook photo, right?

22:29.514 --> 22:32.005
Dude, don't you want
to use an anonymous account?

22:32.084 --> 22:36.111
Why? I'm just
forwarding it along.
With sensitivity and respect.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.757
Owen, Tom,
I said lights out!

22:44.329 --> 22:47.457
Hey, did you guys hear
what I said? Go to bed.

22:58.844 --> 23:01.369
Do you think anyone
will believe it?

23:09.788 --> 23:12.256
I'm telling you,
I read the e-mail.
It's happening.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.417
Just like it did
at that other school.

23:14.493 --> 23:16.654
The first girl,
she was shot
in the face.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.525
I forwarded it...
To my brother.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.497
He sent it to everyone
he knows.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.432
He told me to get off-campus
this weekend
if I didn't wanna get gutted.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.367
He said the second girl...

23:35.847 --> 23:38.645
Owen, just the man
I want to see.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.849
You got a minute?
Sure.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.988
What's in the box?
Antique chess set.

23:46.892 --> 23:50.453
Got to love eBay.
Just now
discovering the Internet?

24:05.644 --> 24:07.271
So I read your e-mail.

24:07.412 --> 24:10.643
Someone forwarded that to you?
Sure did.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.351
Someone also sent it
to the victim's mother.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.352
Who forwarded it
to her attorney.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.615
He called
the Headmaster's office
this morning.

24:24.129 --> 24:27.326
She assumes it originated
off-campus. Don't worry.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.462
I'm not inclined
to inform her otherwise.

24:30.535 --> 24:32.196
Why would I worry?

24:34.840 --> 24:37.570
I glanced at your records
this afternoon.

24:38.109 --> 24:41.567
I see your father
pulled some strings
to get you in here.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.670
Dear old dad.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.910
I also saw that your status
here is probationary.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.081
So you end up
in the Headmaster's office...

24:48.153 --> 24:50.485
you might as well
pack your bags.

24:51.022 --> 24:53.217
Bringing the bitch out early.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.425
Just keeping you
on the defensive.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.625
Speak for yourself.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.602
The arrogance of youth.

25:06.137 --> 25:08.071
Don't you mean
the confidence?

25:09.074 --> 25:11.133
Actually,
I meant the ignorance.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.142
You know, it was just for fun.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.181
Yeah, I do.

25:19.918 --> 25:23.285
But you've got to know
it had some real consequences.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.722
No offense, Mr. Walker.

25:26.157 --> 25:29.058
This is high school.
Nothing's for real.

26:19.711 --> 26:21.508
To buy as many properties...

26:21.580 --> 26:23.138
Sorry. Just a second.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.442
Sorry. Just my son.
Go ahead.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.579
<i>Hello, this is</i>
<i>Charles Matthews. </i>

26:30.655 --> 26:32.122
<i>I'm away from my phone</i>
<i>right now... </i>

26:32.190 --> 26:34.021
<i>but if you leave</i>
<i>your name and number... </i>

26:34.092 --> 26:36.356
<i>I will get back to you. </i>
<i>Thank you. </i>

27:17.268 --> 27:20.829
What up, O-Dog! Sorry.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.701
When I bend it like Beckham,
I usually lock the door.

27:23.775 --> 27:26.209
I got your message.
What?

27:26.945 --> 27:29.140
Text messaging
come in handy?

27:30.749 --> 27:33.343
Dude, I didn't send this.
Yeah, right.

27:34.185 --> 27:36.244
If it was me,
why would I deny it?

27:40.125 --> 27:41.854
Dude, it's Dodger.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.325
Doesn't really seem
like her style.

27:44.462 --> 27:47.625
You kidding? It was her idea
to change the game
in the first place.

27:47.699 --> 27:50.463
She's just taking it
a step further
by coming after you.

27:53.071 --> 27:54.663
Watch and learn.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.805
She usually does laps
after field hockey.

28:00.879 --> 28:03.507
I bet she's on the computer
in the swim team office.

28:05.583 --> 28:09.314
Dude, Dodger's been waiting
for a guy who'll bite back.

28:09.788 --> 28:13.019
If you get laid after this,
you got me to thank,
all right.

28:30.175 --> 28:31.335
Relax, man.

28:31.409 --> 28:33.343
Whoever it is
knows your screen name.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.377
<i>It's got to be someone</i>
<i>on campus. </i>

28:58.837 --> 28:59.997
Hello?

29:27.465 --> 29:28.864
Who's there?

29:33.738 --> 29:37.037
Aim for the shallow end.
We want to scare her,
not kill her.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.473
Yeah, okay.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.078
One, two...

29:49.287 --> 29:52.723
Did you hit her?
What?

29:58.196 --> 30:01.529
I think she's faking it.
Isn't she?

30:04.569 --> 30:06.230
She's not coming up.

30:35.733 --> 30:38.201
Owen Matthews,
you're my hero.

30:40.305 --> 30:41.795
You bitch.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.307
Twice in one day, not bad.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.876
What's that supposed
to mean?
"Be careful what
you wish for"?

30:48.313 --> 30:50.474
Talk sense, boys,
you're losing me.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.517
Someone sent Owen
some IM's
claiming to be the Wolf.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.053
Said they were going
to pick our bones clean.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.280
That's a little
over the top.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.880
Yeah, and pretending
to drown isn't?

31:00.391 --> 31:04.054
Look, I was with Regina
all afternoon,
studying AP Chem.

31:05.897 --> 31:07.489
You can ask her.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.363
No, I believe you.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.039
Someone's just trying
to scare you.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.874
I'm late for the team run,
I got to go.

31:27.352 --> 31:30.913
Okay, so if you were
with Regina
and Randall's at State...

31:31.356 --> 31:34.154
that leaves Mercedes
and Lewis.
And Graham.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.386
You did make him look
like a chump the other night.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.224
You think he's trying
to get me back?

31:38.296 --> 31:40.287
And get back in the game.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.636
The sum total
would be about 51.

31:45.703 --> 31:48.934
Very funny, Graham.
I'm glad you think so.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.001
Do I look like I'm laughing?
Well, I had to do something.

31:53.878 --> 31:55.470
Sure, I understand.

31:55.546 --> 31:59.380
You had to send me
threatening IM's pretending
to be a serial killer.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.977
I have no idea what you could
possibly be talking about.

32:05.290 --> 32:08.054
You didn't just IM as the Wolf
about an hour ago?

32:08.192 --> 32:12.253
No, I've been here
since sixth period.

32:13.197 --> 32:16.189
Owen, you can't convince me...

32:16.267 --> 32:18.132
if you can't
convince yourself.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.632
What were you
just talking about, then,
the thing you had to do?

32:22.707 --> 32:25.676
I filed a noise complaint.
For what?

32:25.743 --> 32:28.211
Are you kidding? Your room
is directly above us...

32:28.279 --> 32:31.476
it sounds like you're having
WWF tryouts up there.

33:01.279 --> 33:02.644
Jesus, Tom.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.742
What happened?

33:12.256 --> 33:15.089
Did you do this?
Of course not.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.389
Somebody else must've...
Why didn't they
touch your stuff?

33:17.462 --> 33:19.828
Tom,
I didn't touch your stuff.
Then who did?

33:42.253 --> 33:44.221
That's Randall's.
I know.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.351
That's disgusting.

33:48.893 --> 33:51.726
Do you think
something happened to Randall?

33:52.563 --> 33:55.259
Like what?
Like he died a violent death?

33:56.300 --> 33:57.699
It's Regina.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.770
She has a recipe
for fake blood
she got off the Internet.

34:00.838 --> 34:02.635
It's just corn syrup.

34:04.809 --> 34:06.709
It used to be sweeter.

34:06.844 --> 34:09.574
Hey, Re-genius,
I can't believe...

34:09.813 --> 34:12.214
you got Randall
to let you borrow
his tongue stud.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.650
You know
you're going to buy me
a new computer, right?

34:17.255 --> 34:18.620
What is it?

34:19.322 --> 34:20.620
Hey, what's up?

34:20.690 --> 34:21.918
<i>I told Tom... </i>

34:21.993 --> 34:24.393
<i>I've been on</i>
<i>an AP Bio field trip</i>
<i>all afternoon. </i>

34:24.462 --> 34:27.556
I thought you were in AP Chem.
<i>No. I took AP Chem</i>
<i>junior year. </i>

34:27.632 --> 34:29.293
<i>Who told you that?</i>

34:37.742 --> 34:39.539
Why are you doing this?

34:41.712 --> 34:43.077
Not here.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.389
Look, I was in town.
Yeah? Doing what?

34:56.327 --> 34:59.524
I was visiting my mom.
What was she doing in town?

35:00.231 --> 35:03.166
She lives here, all right.
This is my home.

35:05.169 --> 35:08.696
Go ahead, laugh all you want.
The Dickens scholar.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.236
Sixth grade English teacher.

35:14.345 --> 35:17.439
I'm not even going to tell you
what my dad does.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.607
So how can you afford...
Scholarship.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.955
You think
people would really care?
I'm a town.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.554
Around here,
town means trash.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.524
You don't have to rub it in.
What?

35:33.598 --> 35:35.088
It's not that.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.601
It's just...

35:38.736 --> 35:42.103
You know, I wish my dad
taught school, lived in town.

35:42.807 --> 35:47.039
I mean, the guy sent me here
just so he wouldn't
have to deal with me.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.178
I'm sorry
I flipped out earlier.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.977
After what happened
at my last school and...

35:54.051 --> 35:55.518
Yeah, you told me.

35:55.586 --> 35:58.419
The vengeful dean
and his darling daughter.

36:01.826 --> 36:05.626
What I didn't tell you
was that I was charged
with possession.

36:06.464 --> 36:09.558
She got busted, was freaked
about her dad's job.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.496
So I took the fall.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.996
I'm not surprised.
Why is that?

36:19.010 --> 36:21.604
You may not have a tell,
Mr. Matthews.

36:22.547 --> 36:24.879
But you do have a weakness.
Yeah?

36:26.384 --> 36:30.252
You're a good guy.
Makes you predictable.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.856
Yeah, if it gets me
kicked out of Westlake...

36:32.924 --> 36:35.358
I might as well sign up
for community college.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.687
Then why did you play the game
to begin with?

36:39.764 --> 36:42.164
The sneaking out.
The hoax e-mail.

36:53.344 --> 36:54.743
At the pool.

36:56.447 --> 36:57.744
You saved me.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.809
You were faking.

37:03.654 --> 37:05.053
I'm not now.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.061
What?

37:20.738 --> 37:22.228
Someone's here.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.395
So?

37:25.142 --> 37:27.576
They're wearing
an orange ski mask.

37:27.878 --> 37:29.402
You're kidding.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.641
If the light's gone off,
it means he's gone, right?

37:34.719 --> 37:36.983
Or standing very still.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.651
Who do you think it is?

37:43.728 --> 37:47.562
It has to be someone we know,
he's wearing a ski mask.
Indoors.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.458
How in the hell
did he get over there?

38:18.896 --> 38:21.296
He's coming this way.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.259
Okay, don't move.

38:23.434 --> 38:26.096
The light will go off
and then we can jump him.

38:55.933 --> 38:59.835
Try German Philosophy.
No one will bother you there.

39:08.612 --> 39:10.273
So I don't get it.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.311
Okay, not to get
all fortune cookie on you...

39:12.383 --> 39:15.716
but the most obvious answer
is usually the right one.

39:18.222 --> 39:22.955
My gut, when I got the IM,
was that it was the real guy.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.119
Why not?

39:25.196 --> 39:27.289
No, I said the most obvious,
not the most ridiculous.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.163
I don't know, I mean,
someone murdered that girl
in the woods.

39:30.234 --> 39:31.792
Maybe he read our e-mail.

39:32.103 --> 39:34.833
Maybe he didn't get the joke.
Maybe he's pissed.

39:34.905 --> 39:38.102
Maybe it's Randall?
It was his tongue ring, right?

39:39.143 --> 39:42.203
It's hard to believe
he'd give up bragging rights
to Jenny Ryder...

39:42.279 --> 39:43.871
just to play killer
in the stacks.

39:43.948 --> 39:46.746
Like he could ever
actually seal the deal.

39:46.917 --> 39:49.078
I bet you $20
he didn't even go to State.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.780
How about dinner?

39:52.123 --> 39:54.318
As long
as it's not over $20.

39:56.894 --> 40:00.091
Damn, I left my book bag
in the stacks.

40:00.664 --> 40:02.097
I'll be right back.

40:02.166 --> 40:05.465
You know what,
I've got something
I should go do.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.735
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:14.445 --> 40:17.812
Sorry. Not a fan of the PDA.

40:54.351 --> 40:58.253
It was a black
Jansport backpack.
I left it on the lower level.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.320
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.

41:00.391 --> 41:04.259
If one of the staff
had picked it up they would've
turned it in by now.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.298
Did you see
any other students?

41:09.867 --> 41:11.266
Maybe they picked it up.

41:14.905 --> 41:16.338
<i>Student information. </i>

41:16.407 --> 41:18.602
Hi, can you give me
Jenny Ryder's phone number?

41:18.676 --> 41:20.701
I believe
she's in the freshman class.

41:20.778 --> 41:22.143
<i>I'll connect you. </i>

41:25.449 --> 41:26.916
<i>Hello?</i>
Hi, Jenny.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.884
Can I speak to Randall?
<i>Who is this?</i>

41:28.953 --> 41:30.750
I'm a friend of his
from school.

41:30.821 --> 41:33.654
I just wanted to tell him...
<i>Tell him yourself. </i>

41:33.724 --> 41:35.214
<i>He's not here. </i>
Well...

41:35.292 --> 41:36.953
Do you know
how I can reach him, or...

41:37.027 --> 41:39.860
<i>I told you, he's not here. </i>
<i>He never showed up. </i>

41:39.930 --> 41:42.831
Did he say where he...
<i>No. He didn't say anything. </i>

41:42.900 --> 41:45.027
<i>He stood me up</i>
<i>for my own formal. </i>

41:45.102 --> 41:47.366
<i>Half my sorority doesn't think</i>
<i>he even exists. </i>

41:47.438 --> 41:49.030
He didn't call?
<i>No. </i>

41:49.106 --> 41:51.336
<i>There has to be something</i>
<i>really wrong with the guy... </i>

41:51.408 --> 41:53.273
<i>to just not show up like that. </i>

41:53.344 --> 41:55.209
I couldn't agree more.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.012
Hey, Mercedes!

42:06.757 --> 42:08.725
You know
where I can find Dodger?

42:08.792 --> 42:10.987
Why?
I have something of hers.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.193
Well, she's
on the floor below me.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.027
I'm sure I'll see her
before lights out.

42:15.099 --> 42:17.932
Actually, I was kind of hoping
to give it to her myself.

42:18.002 --> 42:19.526
I bet you were.

42:20.004 --> 42:22.165
I saw her heading toward
the faculty building.

42:22.239 --> 42:24.730
I think Mr. Walker
is going over her article
with her.

42:24.808 --> 42:25.934
Thank you.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.126
Obi-Wan, what's up,
man?

43:22.232 --> 43:25.030
Hey, you seen
my shoulder pads
around here?

43:25.636 --> 43:27.103
By the way...

43:28.072 --> 43:29.699
librarian dropped
your bag off.

43:29.773 --> 43:32.970
Said someone turned it in,
or something like that.

43:33.510 --> 43:34.738
O- Dog...

43:35.779 --> 43:38.714
what do you think
a murder victim looks like?

43:42.019 --> 43:43.452
Owen!
Tom.

43:44.421 --> 43:46.048
What do you want?

43:46.857 --> 43:49.189
Chill, buddy.
I'm just trying
to figure out...

43:49.259 --> 43:51.523
what I'm going to be
for the Halloween dance.

43:51.595 --> 43:53.961
You figured out
what you're doing
for a costume yet?

43:54.031 --> 43:57.228
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm going.
I've got to work
that night anyway.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.464
What? Dude, we could both
be murder victims.

44:00.537 --> 44:03.199
I mean, Regina is a pro
with effects makeup.

44:03.374 --> 44:05.672
And that's the night the Wolf
is supposed to strike.

44:08.212 --> 44:11.113
Come on, O-Dog, don't make me
chase you to this thing.

44:11.181 --> 44:12.170
Look...

44:12.249 --> 44:15.446
I need to focus
on this article.
It's due tomorrow.

44:16.353 --> 44:17.547
What? Really?

44:17.621 --> 44:19.714
On the Friday
of Halloween?

44:20.991 --> 44:23.152
What heartless bastard
assigned that?

44:25.896 --> 44:27.523
Nice job, ladies.

44:32.336 --> 44:33.667
All right.

44:34.004 --> 44:35.301
Thank you.

44:40.411 --> 44:42.641
Owen, you have
your assignment?

44:42.746 --> 44:45.271
Sure do.
Can I have it, please?

44:45.816 --> 44:47.613
I e-mailed it to you.

44:48.218 --> 44:50.982
And the rest of the school.
Very funny.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.491
All right, let's get down
to business.

44:54.558 --> 44:58.085
Pop quiz. Everybody take out
a pen and a piece of paper.

45:07.371 --> 45:08.861
Owen?
No, wait!

45:08.939 --> 45:10.372
Put the knife back
on the ground.

45:10.441 --> 45:11.908
This isn't mine.
You don't understand.

45:11.975 --> 45:13.567
Someone is trying to play
a joke on me here.

45:13.644 --> 45:15.407
Put it down, Owen! Now!

45:23.454 --> 45:25.752
Can I explain? Please?

45:25.823 --> 45:28.621
Save it for the Headmaster.
Someone trashed my room, too.

45:28.692 --> 45:31.183
Did you report it?
I think it was Randall.

45:31.261 --> 45:32.853
He wasn't even in class
this morning.

45:32.930 --> 45:34.955
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

45:35.032 --> 45:37.500
I think he's trying
to make me think
the e-mail's coming true.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.433
Look, Owen, it's over.

45:39.870 --> 45:43.135
You brought a weapon
to my class.
My hands are tied.

45:43.807 --> 45:47.072
By the morning
you'll be onto your next
missed opportunity.

45:47.978 --> 45:49.377
I know.
Good.

45:49.980 --> 45:52.744
No. I know about you...

45:53.283 --> 45:54.648
and Dodger.

46:00.023 --> 46:01.888
I don't know
what you're talking about.

46:01.959 --> 46:03.517
You're really going to
make me say it?

46:03.594 --> 46:05.687
She's a student.
Exactly.

46:06.663 --> 46:07.687
No.

46:08.398 --> 46:11.196
She's a student.
In my class.

46:11.802 --> 46:14.396
Anything you may have heard
about our relationship
is strictly...

46:14.471 --> 46:16.530
What? Strictly what?

46:17.141 --> 46:19.132
I saw you two last night.

46:21.845 --> 46:23.506
You have proof?
No.

46:24.081 --> 46:25.673
But I won't need it.

46:26.683 --> 46:28.878
If word gets out
about you and a student...

46:28.952 --> 46:32.217
the administration
will invent a reason
to fire you.

46:36.226 --> 46:37.989
You know what, Owen?

46:39.363 --> 46:40.455
What?

46:44.067 --> 46:45.432
I like you.

46:46.270 --> 46:48.704
But you think you're smarter
than you are.

47:23.674 --> 47:25.403
Hey! There you are.

47:25.943 --> 47:28.377
I've been looking
all over for you.

47:28.712 --> 47:29.770
You okay?

47:30.480 --> 47:32.345
Good, 'cause if you're lucky,
later on...

47:32.416 --> 47:33.576
I'll let you go
over the river...

47:33.650 --> 47:35.584
and through the woods.
Sorry.

47:35.652 --> 47:37.449
Not a fan of the PDA.

47:38.789 --> 47:39.949
Funny.

47:41.058 --> 47:42.582
You gonna come
to the dance?

47:42.659 --> 47:43.990
The Wolf is supposed
to strike tonight.

47:44.061 --> 47:46.859
That's not funny.
Besides, I have to work.

47:47.598 --> 47:48.826
Come on.

47:49.399 --> 47:51.492
We're all going to
Tom's lake house right after.

47:51.568 --> 47:53.058
I'm not going.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.734
Why not?
Because I'm not playing
anymore.

47:57.808 --> 48:00.038
And I'm through
with your friends.

48:02.145 --> 48:04.841
Look, I'm really sorry about
what happened in Rich's class.

48:04.915 --> 48:06.405
Randall sucks.

48:07.484 --> 48:09.509
Good news is, I was right.

48:09.753 --> 48:11.414
You owe me dinner.

48:11.922 --> 48:13.913
I don't owe you anything.

50:05.068 --> 50:06.933
Can I help you?
Yeah.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.131
No. I work here.

50:09.373 --> 50:11.000
Not all the time.

50:46.443 --> 50:48.138
I guess I better
watch my back.

50:49.546 --> 50:50.672
Randall?

52:39.756 --> 52:40.745
Boo!

52:40.824 --> 52:43.190
Someone just attacked me.

52:44.494 --> 52:45.984
You sure
it wasn't Tom?

52:46.062 --> 52:47.689
He said he was going
to give you a scare...

52:47.764 --> 52:49.698
for skipping out
on the dance.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.768
Yeah, he tried
to chase me here.

52:53.069 --> 52:55.629
Hey, if you talk to him,
let him know Randall's back.

52:55.705 --> 52:56.694
You saw Randall?

52:56.773 --> 52:58.638
No, but Tom's car
is in the parking lot.

52:58.708 --> 53:01.643
Keys just sitting on the tire
and everything.

53:26.236 --> 53:29.171
See if you can find your car
tomorrow, T-Dog.

53:52.295 --> 53:53.523
Officer!

53:57.634 --> 53:58.862
Officer!

53:59.569 --> 54:01.230
Get on the ground!

54:05.475 --> 54:07.067
Drop the weapon!

54:07.444 --> 54:09.639
Drop it!
It's not real!

54:16.820 --> 54:18.481
I was just joking.

54:22.626 --> 54:23.957
I'm sorry.

55:04.100 --> 55:05.294
What's going on?

55:05.368 --> 55:07.996
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

55:21.051 --> 55:23.042
What was that?
Punch line.

55:31.561 --> 55:33.188
Dead man walking.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.790
I'm going to keep you all here
for the remainder
of the weekend...

56:08.865 --> 56:12.130
while I determine
the best course
of action to take.

56:12.702 --> 56:16.468
I'm at a loss to explain
how or why this happened.

56:16.539 --> 56:19.167
We thought that...
Please, Mr. Matthews.

56:20.477 --> 56:23.412
Mercedes has already told us
all we need to know.

56:23.480 --> 56:27.416
I doubt if you are
any better able to explain
how a juvenile prank...

56:27.484 --> 56:30.783
led to the police
almost shooting
two of my students.

56:32.856 --> 56:35.586
No, ma'am.
Let me be clear, Mr. Matthews.

56:37.627 --> 56:39.424
Given your history...

56:39.963 --> 56:43.330
you are in
far more serious trouble
than your friends.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.934
I don't care
who your father knows.

56:47.437 --> 56:49.962
I'm inclined
to send you packing now.

56:50.640 --> 56:54.201
Mr. Walker, however,
has spoken up in your defense.

56:54.744 --> 56:56.006
He seems to feel that...

56:58.114 --> 56:59.877
Trick or treat.
Adam!

57:00.517 --> 57:02.542
Please, Mommy has to work.

57:02.852 --> 57:04.080
Come on.

57:13.530 --> 57:15.623
Yesterday wasn't Halloween.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.859
It was just
the Halloween dance.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.562
Today's the 31st.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.133
The full moon's tonight.

57:23.239 --> 57:25.639
I'll be sure to set
my tide charts accordingly.

57:25.708 --> 57:27.369
What's your point?

57:27.710 --> 57:29.837
I think our original hoax...

57:30.680 --> 57:32.113
the mass e-mail...

57:32.182 --> 57:34.275
was read by the person
who murdered that girl.

57:34.350 --> 57:35.874
Owen, please.
No.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.852
I got another IM today.

57:38.688 --> 57:40.212
I think
something's going to happen.

57:40.290 --> 57:43.748
Are you sure it's not just
another one of your friends?

58:21.464 --> 58:23.056
Where's Mercedes?

58:23.299 --> 58:25.358
She just spent the whole day
talking to the cops.

58:25.435 --> 58:27.096
No way is she sneaking out.

58:27.170 --> 58:29.195
Whenever you do see her,
make sure you thank her...

58:29.272 --> 58:31.570
for getting us all stuck
on campus, all right?

58:31.641 --> 58:34.235
I mean, what the hell was
she doing in my car, anyway?

58:34.310 --> 58:36.278
Trying to convince you
the killer could be a girl.

58:36.346 --> 58:38.940
Yeah, well, all I'm convinced
is that Randall's
a dead man...

58:39.015 --> 58:41.245
for letting her
touch my ride.

58:41.451 --> 58:43.351
I mean, where the hell is he,
anyway?

58:43.419 --> 58:45.182
Merce gave him a ride
to the bus station...

58:45.255 --> 58:46.745
so we could keep
your car around.

58:46.823 --> 58:48.950
Randall never went
to State.

58:49.592 --> 58:51.457
I think something
happened to him.

58:51.528 --> 58:54.190
The IM said, "Be careful
what you wish for. "

58:54.264 --> 58:55.288
Good job, Scoob.

58:55.365 --> 58:57.026
You figure that one all out
by yourself...

58:57.100 --> 58:58.533
or did you get some help
from Shaggy?

58:58.601 --> 59:00.091
I don't think
this is a joke.

59:01.271 --> 59:03.102
You're the only one,
then, man.

59:03.172 --> 59:05.732
Mercedes pulled the stunt
with Tom's car, right?

59:05.808 --> 59:08.038
She hid in the back,
I put the fake blood
in the front.

59:08.111 --> 59:09.100
Okay.

59:09.178 --> 59:12.375
So who was following
me and Dodger in the library?

59:15.318 --> 59:16.478
Sorry.

59:17.887 --> 59:20.378
I was really trying
to scare Dodger.

59:21.791 --> 59:23.884
You're always
the shepherd.

59:24.961 --> 59:27.486
I figured it was time
you felt like a sheep.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.156
She took my bag.

59:29.899 --> 59:32.367
Yeah, I saw you left it there,
bumped it to Tom...

59:32.435 --> 59:34.300
and figured he would
give it to you.

59:34.370 --> 59:35.803
You put a knife in my bag?

59:35.872 --> 59:37.430
Only because
you trashed my stuff.

59:37.507 --> 59:40.374
Why would I trash our room?
You didn't trash
our room, man.

59:40.443 --> 59:42.240
You trashed my side.
It was all my stuff.

59:42.312 --> 59:44.473
Look. Mercedes had
an earring...

59:44.547 --> 59:46.674
that looked
like Randall's tongue stud.

59:46.749 --> 59:49.513
She figured it'd be
a good setup for the car.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.451
You smashed my laptop?

59:52.255 --> 59:54.223
I got a little carried away.

59:54.290 --> 59:56.349
I was in character.
In...

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.090
Dude! If I would have known
what you and the Vocab Ho
were up to...

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.562
I would have
gone after you guys...

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:02.825
instead of Owen
in the dining hall.

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:05.424
Jesus, why do you make it
so easy for us to hate you
sometimes?

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.162
Same reason your girlfriend
makes it so easy.

01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:09.534
Who sent the IM's
from the Wolf?

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.875
It's not us, man,
it's got to be Randall,
all right.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.781
If Randall was behind this,
don't you think...

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:25.480
he would have shown up by now
to gloat?

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.350
Are you sure
he got on that bus?

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:31.254
I told you, I wasn't with him.
Merce took him
to the bus station.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.817
Then call her.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.760
Jesus, for what I paid
for this thing...

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:41.998
you'd think I get better
than one bar of service.

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.095
Wait a second.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:47.671
How do we know
Owen's telling us the truth?

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.275
Excuse me?

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.741
I mean...

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.239
he could be making
this whole thing up.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.614
To get back at us
for the other stuff.

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:57.448
Why would I do that?

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.054
I'm the one
they're about to expel.

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:02.952
Exactly.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.328
This is it.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.129
This is the new game.

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.163
Owen knows
he's going to take the fall.

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.801
Brought us all here
to confess.

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:22.105
Surprise, surprise.
You all fell for it.

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.614
Victims of your own lies.

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:32.387
Is that what you're going to
tell Mr. Walker?

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.851
I saw you two.

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.053
In his office.

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.296
Is that why you've been
such a prick?

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.066
You're the one
who's screwing a teacher.

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.569
I was.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.843
It's over.

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:04.548
After the library...

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.654
I went to Rich's office
to end it.

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:10.884
But I saw you...

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.524
you kissed him back.

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.095
What else could I do?

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:23.437
He tried a lot more
before I pushed him off.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:30.369
Then he told me
I was too mature
for guys my own age.

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.014
He did what?

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.349
I guess he was right.

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.724
I don't believe it.

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.389
I do.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:57.899
You should really get
some sleep, baby.

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:01.336
<i>I'm all congested</i>
<i>from crying. </i>

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.937
I think I'm going to
take a shower.
The steam might help.

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:07.975
<i>Did your RA take off?</i>

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:12.377
The whole dorm's empty
except for the incarcerated.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.553
<i>You okay?</i>

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:20.295
Yeah, just...

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.230
still a little spooked.

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:32.200
So what are you guys
talking about?

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.072
We're just trying
to figure out
who the wanna-be-Wolf is.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.375
Well, who is it?
<i>They think it's Randall. </i>

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:42.417
<i>I told them you dropped</i>
<i>him off at the bus station. </i>

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:44.781
I didn't.

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:46.786
Not really.

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:50.690
I left him in town.
He said had some time to kill.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:54.224
It was, like, an hour
till the next bus.

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:57.095
He probably just needed
to go buy condoms.

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:02.094
<i>You taking your clothes off?</i>

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.163
Yes.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.235
<i>Tell me about it. </i>

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:08.941
I'm in my underwear.

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:11.911
<i>Which ones?</i>

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:15.241
I'm wearing your favorites.

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:18.176
Take a picture.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.420
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:23.389
Come on,
it's like Phone Sex 2.0.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.974
What's taking so long?
Relax, I just sent it.

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.283
Merce, someone's there.

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.878
What are you
talking about?

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:54.413
You okay?

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.955
<i>Tom just scared</i>
<i>the crap out of me. </i>

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:02.527
Still pissed about your car,
Tommy-boy?

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.829
What's going on, man?
We heard you shout.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:07.334
Merce, Tom's here.

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.427
<i>In the chapel. </i>

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:24.114
Merce was attacked!
She was getting in the shower!

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:27.378
Call for help!

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.385
Dude, it was
just another joke.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.451
He probably wasn't
even on the phone with her.

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:35.087
It was the guy
that shot the girl.

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.529
Are you listening
to yourself?

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:39.659
The first murder happened
in a bathroom, remember?

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.795
We wrote it.
The victims are us!

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.238
<i>Campus Security. </i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:50.871
I think someone's
being attacked. Please send
the police right away.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.211
<i>Look, we're tired</i>
<i>of the practical jokes. </i>

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:55.682
<i>If you put a member</i>
<i>of the staff on,</i>
<i>I'll be happy... </i>

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:58.845
But there's no one here!
<i>Once I speak to your RA... </i>

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.953
Wait, where are you going?
I'm going back to my dorm.

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:09.361
Look, maybe Owen's right,
maybe we should just take off.

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:11.093
No, we're not taking off!

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.362
Tom, she's right,
we have to get out of here!

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.336
You're not going anywhere.
You keep out of this.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.998
All she's trying to do
is make a bad situation worse.

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:21.100
Said the self-centered
loudmouth
to no one in particular.

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:22.940
Do you ever shut up?

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.773
What?

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:28.809
What?

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:31.115
What's on your face?

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.427
It's on my sweatshirt.

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:12.421
Oh, my God!

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:14.222
Randall!

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:21.892
We have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here!

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.100
What about Dodger?

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:28.038
What about her, man?

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:31.577
I'm going to find her.

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:33.711
Will you wait for me?

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:42.319
You have 20 minutes.
All right?

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:46.986
At 2:15 we are out of here.
With or without you.

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:07.609
Hello?

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.248
Lewis!

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.055
Are you okay?

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.682
Merce, she's gone.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.249
I surprised him.

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:20.591
I think I hurt him, but...
Hold on, I'll be right there!

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:22.130
No! Get help!

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.993
Tom and Regina are waiting,
we have to get...

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:28.529
Lewis!

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:08.470
Dodger?

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.339
Tom, stop!

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:17.670
Tom!

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:25.651
Mr. Walker.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.859
Mr. Walker!

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:19.467
Hello?

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.169
<i>Owen?</i>
Dodger?

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.913
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>in Rich's office?</i>

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:28.575
I'm trying to get help.
Where are you?

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.550
<i>I just found Mercedes. </i>

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.286
<i>She's dead. </i>

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:36.647
<i>What do we do?</i>

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.591
Tom and Regina
already left.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:42.654
We have to find
a way off-campus.
<i>Where's Rich?</i>

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.298
I don't know.

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:47.163
<i>I think he keeps</i>
<i>a set of car keys there. </i>

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.334
<i>Look in his desk. </i>
Good.

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.802
I'll meet you
in your room.

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:53.898
<i>No, I'm on my way</i>
<i>to you. </i>

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:56.809
Be careful.

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:58.473
<i>I will. </i>

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:01.040
<i>Owen, I'm sorry. </i>

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.142
Me, too.

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:10.018
Just get here, okay.
<i>I can see you in the window. </i>

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:12.318
I can't see you.

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:14.085
<i>I'm right here. </i>

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.063
Run!

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.165
No!

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:58.504
Oh, my God.

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.420
Keys. Keys. Keys.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.049
I have a gun.

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:45.519
I've called the police.
They're on their way.

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.856
Owen, is that you?

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.288
Mr. Walker?

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.122
Look, I'm coming in.

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:54.556
Don't do anything.

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:02.265
Where'd you get that?

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:03.599
Your desk.

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:04.764
What?

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.372
It's yours.

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:10.207
Why don't you give it to me?
Not a chance.

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:12.543
Relax, Owen.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:14.275
No one's going to hurt you.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.542
Look.

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.310
Where did you get those?

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:22.084
I found them
in the stairwell.
Oh, God.

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:25.917
You did this, didn't you?

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:28.561
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.858
Dodger called me...

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:31.957
That's why
you stood up for me...

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:35.230
with the Headmaster.
You wanted me here for this!

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.938
Why don't you give me
the gun, son?

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.997
You killed them!

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.534
Mercedes! Randall! Lewis!

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:45.473
Dodger!

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.581
I don't know
what's going on.
Yes, you do.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.582
No, listen to me.
Don't lie to me.

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:53.678
Your friends are probably
just screwing with you.
Give me the gun.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:56.121
Is this the gun that killed
that girl in the woods?

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:57.351
Becky?

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.922
Were you screwing her, too?

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:05.062
Dodger tell you that?

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.431
She didn't have to.

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.810
Oh, my God!

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.882
Owen.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.920
Are you okay? We...

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.740
It was...

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:26.037
I don't know what to say.

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.979
It was just for fun,
we had...

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:34.989
We had been playing this game,
and we decided that...

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.915
We decided to
work together tonight.

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:41.185
We were trying to scare
Owen and Mercedes...

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.731
because they got everyone
in trouble before.

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:51.462
Listen, we didn't think that
anything was going to happen.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.770
How could you let Graham
do that to me?

01:16:57.012 --> 01:17:00.243
Baby, I didn't even know
about it
till I left the chapel.

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:12.257
Dodger wasn't supposed
to hit me that hard.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.466
Why did you hide
when Mr. Walker showed up?

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.839
Why didn't you
say something?

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.837
No, thanks, Dad.

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:49.656
My attorney tells me
the news is good.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.387
They're going to drop
the charges. Self-defense.

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:55.157
It'll be a few years
probation, if that.

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:57.524
Dad...

01:18:57.966 --> 01:18:59.729
how's that possible?

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:02.702
They ran ballistics
on the handgun. It turned out
to be the weapon...

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:06.502
the police were looking for
in the shooting
of that local girl.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.769
Really?

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.670
It appears you shot
a wanted murderer.

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.376
How do they know
it was him?

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:20.421
It seems he was involved
with the victim at some point.

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:21.956
They checked
his credit card bill...

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:25.117
and found out that he'd
purchased two airline tickets
last month.

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:28.128
One in his name,
the other in the girl's.

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:30.593
Do they know
why he killed her?

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.899
My attorney says
they're calling it
a crime of passion.

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:37.503
No one ever really knows
the truth with these things.

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:42.674
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Matthews...

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:45.907
but one of your son's friends
is here to see him.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.739
Go ahead, Owen.

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:54.049
It's going to be okay, son.
I promise.

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.653
Right over there.

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:26.151
I'm so sorry.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.684
For everything.

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:39.657
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:42.335
You have to believe me.
It's okay.

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:49.437
I wish I could
make it up to you.
I know.

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:55.041
If I had known Rich
was involved with that girl...

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:57.812
I wouldn't have played
this stupid joke.

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:06.954
What did you say?

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:12.396
If I had known Rich
was screwing that girl...

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:15.368
I wouldn't have talked
the others into this.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.071
You're right.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.608
You're absolutely right.

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:24.206
I don't understand.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.710
You wouldn't play some game...

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:31.041
if you knew
Rich was cheating on you.

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.955
That's what I just said.

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.756
You would get him back.

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.694
Owen, I'm confused.
I don't...

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:44.288
No, you're not.

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:47.033
That's what
you want me to believe.

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:50.770
Just like...

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:55.105
you wanted me to believe
that you were off-campus...

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.436
when the first IM went out.

01:21:58.146 --> 01:22:00.046
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:01.514
Yes, you do.

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:05.976
In the chapel.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.413
You said you had ended it
with Rich.

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:13.793
I don't think
that's what happened.

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:18.226
I think you were still
in love with him.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.064
I think you knew that girl.

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.228
This is my home.

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:24.363
And you knew she was
still sleeping with Rich.

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.236
Some townie was screwing
the wrong guy.

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:27.468
Dodger tell you that?

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:28.941
You murdered her.

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.637
Well, the girl was shot.

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.708
Then you planted the gun.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.007
I've got something
I should go do.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.675
And told me where to find it.

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:37.843
Look in his desk.

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.409
I was your guy.

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:41.318
Someone's just trying
to scare you.

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:42.879
From the moment we met...

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.425
It's a small school.

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.754
Word spreads fast.

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:46.851
...you planned it.

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:49.055
It was her idea
to change the game
in the first place.

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.392
We're going to create
a killer.

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:51.762
The whole thing.

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.233
It's like you're playing
checkers.

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:58.069
And I'm playing chess.

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:01.039
Makes you predictable.

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.509
You knew I'd shoot him.

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:13.084
Owen, that's crazy.

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:16.384
Really?

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:20.325
I thought it was the object
of the game.

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:22.087
Avoid suspicion.

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.558
<i>Manipulate your friends. </i>
<i>Eliminate your enemies. </i>

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:38.474
Honestly, Owen,
even if that were true...

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:46.251
who would believe you?
