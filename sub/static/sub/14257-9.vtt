01:14.419 --> 01:17.090
Well, Vernon, any ideas yet

01:17.091 --> 01:19.061
for tonight's editorial ?

01:19.062 --> 01:21.933
Not yet, sir, but i'm working on it.

01:21.934 --> 01:24.271
Well, come up with something,

01:24.272 --> 01:25.541
and I mean pronto !

01:28.614 --> 01:30.317
Scat ! Come on,ere !

01:30.318 --> 01:31.553
Beat it, would you !

01:41.040 --> 01:42.175
We need an editorial,

01:42.176 --> 01:44.580
and I mean pronto.

01:44.581 --> 01:46.550
What will Vern say
when he finds out

01:46.551 --> 01:49.223
we don't have an editorial ?

01:49.224 --> 01:50.358
Rats !

01:50.359 --> 01:52.530
What a brilliant idea, sir !

01:52.531 --> 01:54.066
"Rats--boon to mankind !"

01:54.067 --> 01:56.070
"Our friend, the rat."

01:56.071 --> 01:57.540
"Rats throughout history."

01:57.541 --> 02:00.079
They're a menace to society !

02:00.080 --> 02:02.717
Absolutely !
Disgusting little vermin.

02:02.718 --> 02:05.757
April, you're going to dig up the facts

02:05.758 --> 02:08.262
About our city's rat problem.

02:08.263 --> 02:09.764
That's tonight's editorial.

02:09.765 --> 02:10.901
Rats ?

02:10.901 --> 02:12.538
You heard me.

02:12.539 --> 02:13.973
Rats !

02:19.252 --> 02:22.491
Don't do it, Michelangelo !

02:22.492 --> 02:25.431
Don't try talking me out of it.

02:25.432 --> 02:27.602
You don't know what you're
letting yourself in for.

02:27.603 --> 02:32.312
A turtle's got to do
what a turtle's got to do.

02:32.313 --> 02:36.620
Please, Michelangelo,
don't go for pizza !

02:36.621 --> 02:38.457
It's raining cats and dogs.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.629
And the dough

02:40.630 --> 02:42.833
besides, there is still one last box

02:42.834 --> 02:45.037
of pizza mix in the cupboard.

02:45.038 --> 02:46.674
There is ?

02:46.675 --> 02:48.178
All right !

02:48.179 --> 02:50.015
Let's get cooking !

02:50.016 --> 02:51.517
Hey, you're right, sensei.

02:51.518 --> 02:55.827
There's enough here for a 
major nosh.

02:55.828 --> 02:57.162
A rat !

02:57.163 --> 03:01.138
Hey, fur-face !
That was our din-din !

03:03.744 --> 03:05.046
I'll get him !

03:07.051 --> 03:09.087
Don't let him escape.

03:12.729 --> 03:14.933
Your reflexes
must be dull indeed

03:14.934 --> 03:17.405
if a mere rodent outmaneuvers you.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.912
That furry little dude
was more than mere.

03:20.913 --> 03:22.581
Someone's coming.

03:22.582 --> 03:24.753
Maybe it's the rat again.

03:24.754 --> 03:26.122
Tub-u-loso !

03:26.123 --> 03:28.327
This time we'll nail him.

03:30.299 --> 03:32.302
Here he comes.

03:32.303 --> 03:35.575
Watch it, guys !

03:35.576 --> 03:36.644
April !

03:36.645 --> 03:38.448
There's nothing like a warm greeting

03:38.449 --> 03:40.085
from old friends.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.655
Sorry, April.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.826
We mistook you for someone else...

03:43.827 --> 03:47.166
We're talking about a lowdown
pizza-stealing rat !

03:47.167 --> 03:48.602
What a coincidence.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.008
I'm researching a story on rats !

03:51.009 --> 03:52.811
I think every one of them

03:52.812 --> 03:55.149
should be chased out of town.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.790
Present company excepted, 
of course.

03:58.791 --> 04:00.226
Of course.

04:00.227 --> 04:01.729
I came down to investigate

04:01.730 --> 04:04.368
the sewer situation firsthand.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.708
Master Splinter, are you all right ?

04:07.709 --> 04:08.743
Yes.

04:08.744 --> 04:10.748
Just an odd feeling.

04:10.749 --> 04:12.251
Do not worry.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.721
It will pass.

04:13.722 --> 04:15.223
I better hustle.

04:15.224 --> 04:17.661
I go on the air in 20 minutes.

04:21.103 --> 04:24.609
I wonder what's taking April so long.

04:24.610 --> 04:27.550
This place gives me the willies.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.290
Ok, Irma ! Let's roll !

04:31.291 --> 04:33.361
So, what did you find out ?

04:33.362 --> 04:34.931
I think Vern's exaggerating.

04:34.932 --> 04:37.870
I didn't see a single rat.

04:37.871 --> 04:39.942
I'm entitled to my opinion.

04:39.943 --> 04:41.611
You don't have to hiss at me.

04:41.612 --> 04:44.852
Who's hissing ?
I agree with you.

04:46.923 --> 04:48.426
Oh, no !

04:48.427 --> 04:50.897
Two flat tires.

04:50.898 --> 04:53.871
Make that four flat tires.

04:53.872 --> 04:55.741
Oh, hurry, Irma.

04:55.742 --> 04:56.977
If I miss that broadcast,

04:56.978 --> 04:59.214
Vern will dock me a month's pay.

05:01.654 --> 05:04.325
Irma, did you ever have the feeling

05:04.326 --> 05:05.995
someone's following you ?

05:05.996 --> 05:08.734
No. What's it like ?

05:08.735 --> 05:09.736
Rats !

05:09.737 --> 05:12.241
Zillions and zillions of rats.

05:12.242 --> 05:14.345
Let--let's find a taxi.

05:14.346 --> 05:15.347
Quick !

05:15.348 --> 05:16.918
Taxi !
Taxi !

05:17.921 --> 05:19.122
Taxi !

05:19.123 --> 05:21.194
Where to, ladies ?

05:21.195 --> 05:24.200
Channel 6 news.

05:24.201 --> 05:25.268
S-sorry.

05:25.269 --> 05:27.539
I ain't allowed to carry

05:27.540 --> 05:29.543
more than f-f-five passengers.

05:29.544 --> 05:31.982
Irma, don't look now,

05:31.983 --> 05:35.690
but I think we're in serious trouble.

05:35.691 --> 05:37.227
Thank heavens !

05:37.228 --> 05:38.195
A bus !

05:43.306 --> 05:44.909
Where is April ?

05:44.910 --> 05:47.915
She's on in two minutes !

05:47.916 --> 05:49.585
You know how women are

05:49.586 --> 05:52.391
when it comes to time.

05:52.392 --> 05:54.929
Ok, Vern, i'm ready with my editorial.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.299
It had better be good.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.370
And here, straight from the field

05:58.371 --> 06:00.608
is April O'Neill with a channel 
6 editorial.

06:00.609 --> 06:01.777
Good evening.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.814
I hope this doesn't
Upset our viewers,

06:03.815 --> 06:06.453
But i'd like
To talk about rats.

06:06.454 --> 06:08.124
Our city is being overrun

06:08.125 --> 06:10.996
With hordes of these
Disgusting creatures.

06:10.997 --> 06:12.465
Upset us ?
Heck no !

06:12.466 --> 06:14.837
This is a terrific
Dinner topic.

06:14.838 --> 06:17.810
Something must be done
About these vicious rodents

06:17.811 --> 06:19.146
Before it's too late.

06:19.147 --> 06:20.983
They carry disease,
Pestilence,

06:20.984 --> 06:24.290
And they aren't
Even cute !

06:24.291 --> 06:25.659
We urge the city

06:25.660 --> 06:28.900
To do something
About them immediately.

06:28.901 --> 06:31.839
Hey ! Who pulled
The plug ?

06:31.840 --> 06:35.012
What happened
To april ?

06:35.013 --> 06:37.684
Vernon:
She's--she's gone !

06:37.685 --> 06:38.853
April ?

06:38.854 --> 06:40.123
Gone ?

06:59.898 --> 07:02.001
Donatello: put the pedal
To the metal, leonardo.

07:02.002 --> 07:03.772
We've got
To find april.

07:03.773 --> 07:06.276
Leonardo: this is the best
Place to start looking.

07:06.277 --> 07:09.817
Ok. All together now.

07:12.090 --> 07:15.195
Why can't april have
A ground-floor office ?

07:15.196 --> 07:17.934
I wish we had
Those antigravity boots

07:17.935 --> 07:19.370
From episode six.

07:19.371 --> 07:20.873
Check it out.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.345
There's the studio
She disappeared from.

07:25.149 --> 07:28.022
Whoever heard
Of losing a commentator

07:28.023 --> 07:29.391
In the middle
Of a broadcast ?

07:29.392 --> 07:32.865
I keep telling you
She's not reliable.

07:32.866 --> 07:36.071
Vernon,
Find april o'neill

07:36.072 --> 07:38.510
So i can fire her !

07:39.713 --> 07:42.985
Boy, he's really
On the warpath.

07:42.986 --> 07:45.491
Irma, this is all
Your fault.

07:45.492 --> 07:47.996
My fault ! How come ?

07:47.997 --> 07:49.165
If you hadn't--
That is,

07:49.166 --> 07:50.167
If you had only--

07:50.168 --> 07:52.506
I mean, if you
And april--

07:52.507 --> 07:55.177
Trust me,
It's all your fault.

07:55.178 --> 07:57.349
It's guys like that
Who make me glad

07:57.350 --> 07:59.887
I'm a member of
The opposite sex.

08:01.258 --> 08:03.795
The turtles ?

08:03.796 --> 08:06.668
Quick, irma, what
Happened to april ?

08:06.669 --> 08:08.204
You know as much as i do.

08:08.205 --> 08:11.176
One minute she's here,
The next she's gone.

08:11.177 --> 08:14.183
If you ask me,
It's those rats.

08:14.184 --> 08:16.054
Hey, lighten up,
Compadres.

08:16.055 --> 08:17.723
If april needed us,

08:17.724 --> 08:20.129
She'd scope us out
On her turtlecom.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.199
You mean this turtlecom ?

08:24.038 --> 08:26.074
Fellas, we've got to check

08:26.075 --> 08:29.081
Every storm drain
And sewer pipe in the city

08:29.082 --> 08:30.650
Until we find april.

08:30.651 --> 08:33.089
What are we
Waiting for ?

08:33.090 --> 08:34.158
Cowabunga !

08:34.159 --> 08:36.395
Turtle power !

08:36.395 --> 08:39.436
How romantic.

08:39.437 --> 08:40.438
They're just like

08:40.438 --> 08:43.611
Four little
Green errol flynns.

08:43.611 --> 08:46.083
It's good of you to help us
Search for april,

08:46.084 --> 08:47.085
Master splinter.

08:47.086 --> 08:48.787
Perhaps my
Rodent instincts

08:48.788 --> 08:50.358
May be of some use.

08:50.359 --> 08:53.263
Well, guys,
Any sign of her ?

08:53.264 --> 08:54.299
<I>nada.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.269
Zero. Zilch.

08:56.270 --> 08:57.473
We've checked
Everywhere,

08:57.474 --> 09:00.379
From the sludge pump
To the garbage runoff

09:00.380 --> 09:02.483
To the raw
Sewage drain.

09:02.484 --> 09:04.453
Oh, the scenic route.

09:06.225 --> 09:09.163
Master splinter,
Are you all right ?

09:09.164 --> 09:10.767
Yes...i am fine.

09:10.768 --> 09:15.075
Please, let us
Continue the search.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.113
I'm worried
About <I>sensei.

09:17.114 --> 09:19.418
He's acting
Kind of strange.

09:19.419 --> 09:20.620
I've noticed that, too.

09:20.621 --> 09:22.624
Maybe we should keep
An eye on him.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.194
Now there's a switch.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.044
Welcome to
My humble abode,

09:32.045 --> 09:33.613
Miss o'neill.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.954
I trust
You're comfortable.

09:38.692 --> 09:40.461
Who are you ?

09:40.462 --> 09:43.501
I am his royal
Rodent majesty,

09:43.502 --> 09:45.238
The rat king !

09:45.239 --> 09:47.743
And these are
My loyal subjects.

09:47.744 --> 09:51.050
My simplest wish
Is their command.

09:51.051 --> 09:54.089
Why did you
Bring me here ?

09:54.090 --> 09:56.595
To keep you from telling
Those vicious lies

09:56.596 --> 09:58.599
About my loyal
Rat subjects.

10:00.102 --> 10:01.938
Forget dogs.

10:01.939 --> 10:05.412
The rat is truly
Man's best friend.

10:05.413 --> 10:07.283
Rat king !
Mister,

10:07.284 --> 10:10.256
You've got a serious
Identity problem.

10:10.257 --> 10:12.795
You wish
A demonstration ?

10:21.046 --> 10:22.548
Haven't you heard ?

10:22.549 --> 10:27.057
Music hath charms
To soothe the savage beast.

10:27.058 --> 10:29.896
I think you're the only
Beast around here.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.400
Don't you understand ?

10:31.401 --> 10:34.004
My devoted
Rodent followers and i

10:34.005 --> 10:37.847
Are establishing a new form
Of government in these sewers.

10:37.848 --> 10:39.382
A ratocracy !

10:39.383 --> 10:42.388
And i am their leader !

10:42.389 --> 10:44.359
Brother,
You're also nuttier

10:44.360 --> 10:46.297
Than a truckload
Of fruit cakes.

10:47.367 --> 10:48.935
Yo, april !

10:48.936 --> 10:50.906
Where are you ?

10:50.907 --> 10:52.042
It's no use.

10:52.043 --> 10:53.880
We've covered
Every tunnel

10:53.881 --> 10:55.482
And still no sign of her.

10:55.483 --> 10:58.255
Man, this place is
Emptier than a pizza pan

10:58.256 --> 11:00.860
After an attack of
The midnight munchies.

11:02.398 --> 11:04.201
Leonardo, here.

11:04.202 --> 11:05.570
It's irma. Hi.

11:05.571 --> 11:06.906
Listen, i know
Where april is

11:06.907 --> 11:08.877
And who's got her.

11:08.878 --> 11:11.983
Some nut called
The rat king.

11:11.984 --> 11:13.486
How do you
Know that ?

11:13.487 --> 11:16.893
Ahh, just call it
Woman's intuition.

11:20.502 --> 11:22.171
Uh, miss o'neill.

11:22.172 --> 11:25.411
What is it now...
Your highness ?

11:26.480 --> 11:27.950
It's lunchtime.

11:27.951 --> 11:30.889
Can i interest you
In some ratatouille ?

11:30.890 --> 11:34.330
Here's what i think
Of your offer.

11:36.033 --> 11:39.006
You're quite attractive
When you're angry.

11:39.007 --> 11:41.510
Especially for someone
Without whiskers.

11:41.511 --> 11:44.851
Just wait till my friends
The turtles get here !

11:44.852 --> 11:46.655
Turtles ?

11:46.656 --> 11:49.928
They're no match
For my army of rats.

11:49.929 --> 11:50.997
It just so happens

11:50.998 --> 11:52.166
They're trained
By splinter,

11:52.167 --> 11:53.535
A true ninja master.

11:53.536 --> 11:55.172
I see.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.112
And what is he,
A salamander ?

12:00.117 --> 12:03.623
If you must know,
He's a rat. Oops.

12:03.624 --> 12:05.761
A rat, you say ?

12:07.399 --> 12:08.900
Ah, perfect.

12:08.901 --> 12:12.408
With a ninja master
In my power,

12:12.409 --> 12:14.913
I can rule every rodent
In the city.

12:14.914 --> 12:18.421
Yes, my
Faithful followers.

12:18.422 --> 12:20.358
We'll stop these turtles

12:20.359 --> 12:22.094
Before they invade
Our rodent realm.

12:22.095 --> 12:26.470
We'll do this by turning
Their master against them.

12:30.579 --> 12:33.050
It seems hopeless,
Master.

12:33.051 --> 12:35.489
Nevertheless, we
Must keep searching.

12:36.926 --> 12:39.029
Sensei,
What's wrong ?

12:40.266 --> 12:41.768
Uh, i...

12:41.769 --> 12:43.271
I feel strange,

12:43.272 --> 12:46.277
As if some force
Is compelling me

12:46.278 --> 12:49.785
To do things
Beyond my control.

12:49.786 --> 12:51.388
Hold it.

12:51.389 --> 12:54.528
You're trespassing
On royal grounds.

12:54.529 --> 12:56.432
Who are you, dude ?

12:56.433 --> 12:59.806
You will address me
With respect.

12:59.807 --> 13:02.210
I am the rat king.

13:02.211 --> 13:03.480
The rat king.

13:03.481 --> 13:05.518
He's the one
Who grabbed april !

13:05.519 --> 13:06.987
Listen, mister,

13:06.988 --> 13:08.490
Just hand over
Miss o'neill,

13:08.491 --> 13:10.094
And no one
Will get hurt.

13:12.666 --> 13:16.908
That music. I--
I cannot resist.

13:16.909 --> 13:20.415
Actually, it is kind of
A catchy tune.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.855
Splinter,
From now on,

13:23.856 --> 13:26.260
You will obey
Only me.

13:26.261 --> 13:28.665
Yes, your highness.

13:28.666 --> 13:30.302
Your highness ?

13:30.303 --> 13:32.039
And my royal decree

13:32.040 --> 13:35.412
Is destroy
Those turtles !

13:35.413 --> 13:39.254
Your command...
I obey, master.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.581
Oh. Oh, no.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.585
Master splinter
May be too much

13:54.586 --> 13:56.489
Even for all four of us.

13:56.490 --> 14:00.330
Oh, in that case,
We're turtle soup.

14:00.331 --> 14:03.938
Turtles,
Prepare to say sayonara.

14:10.619 --> 14:12.956
Now,
My willing subject,

14:12.957 --> 14:14.961
Finish them off.

14:14.962 --> 14:16.965
Yes, your majesty.

14:26.819 --> 14:29.324
No, master !
Stop !

14:35.003 --> 14:37.340
Something's
Come over splinter.

14:37.341 --> 14:39.845
He's like
Totally flipped out !

14:39.846 --> 14:42.083
What are we gonna do ?
I don't want to fight him.

14:42.084 --> 14:44.521
We can't just
Leave him here.

14:44.522 --> 14:46.692
Ha ha ha !
It's no use, turtles.

14:46.693 --> 14:49.365
If it has four legs
And squeaks,

14:49.366 --> 14:50.935
It obeys only me.

14:50.936 --> 14:54.409
Master splinter,
Listen to me !

14:54.410 --> 14:57.215
Ignore the rat
King's commands !

14:57.216 --> 15:00.588
No, splinter.
I am your ruler.

15:00.589 --> 15:02.392
Obey <I>me.

15:02.393 --> 15:05.331
Your will is
Stronger than his.

15:05.332 --> 15:08.303
You must turn
Against the rat king !

15:08.304 --> 15:11.243
I don't think
He's buying it.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.581
There's only one thing
Left to do.

15:13.582 --> 15:17.322
I won't try
To defend myself.

15:17.323 --> 15:19.326
Now,
My loyal subject,

15:19.327 --> 15:20.897
Finish him !

15:29.849 --> 15:32.086
It worked, master.

15:32.087 --> 15:33.722
You're yourself
Again.

15:34.793 --> 15:37.330
Yes...barely.

15:37.331 --> 15:40.136
Come on. Let's
Blow this joint.

15:40.137 --> 15:41.573
Mondo notion, bud.

15:41.574 --> 15:46.516
Unh ! They've escaped
With their ninja master !

15:46.517 --> 15:49.990
Or should i say,
<I>my ninja master.

15:49.991 --> 15:54.766
This contest of wills
Is not over yet.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.339
Never before have i
Turned on my pupils.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.910
I am ashamed.

15:59.911 --> 16:01.012
But, <I>sensei,

16:01.013 --> 16:03.919
Your will power did
Triumph over his.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.522
Thank you, leonardo,

16:05.523 --> 16:08.594
But i don't wish to
Run that risk again.

16:08.595 --> 16:10.766
That is why
You turtles

16:10.767 --> 16:13.939
Must search for
April without me.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.211
I dare not face
The rat king

16:16.212 --> 16:18.549
Until my strength
Returns.

16:18.550 --> 16:19.884
Don't worry, master.

16:19.885 --> 16:21.054
You trained us well.

16:21.055 --> 16:22.925
We'll get april back.

16:22.926 --> 16:24.427
You're darned right !

16:24.428 --> 16:25.830
Yeah, for sure !

16:28.069 --> 16:31.074
Irma, why aren't you
Looking for april ?

16:31.075 --> 16:32.578
I am.

16:32.579 --> 16:34.148
How,
By watching tv ?

16:34.149 --> 16:35.584
It so happens,
Vernon,

16:35.585 --> 16:38.757
I'm looking for
A certain news story,

16:38.758 --> 16:41.429
And i just hit pay dirt.

16:41.430 --> 16:44.836
That's the expose we did on
Abandoned subway stations.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.940
Right.
And i've got a feeling

16:46.941 --> 16:50.181
That's where the rat king's
Keeping april.

16:50.182 --> 16:52.853
Rat king ?
What rat king ?

16:52.854 --> 16:56.259
Come on. I'll
Explain on the way.

16:56.260 --> 16:59.199
But i'm not dressed
To meet royalty.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.047
Sh-shouldn't we get
Some professional help ?

17:06.048 --> 17:07.650
Relax, vernon.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.988
We got the four
Best bodyguards

17:09.989 --> 17:11.491
In the business.

17:11.492 --> 17:13.996
Irma to turtles.
Irma to turtles.

17:13.997 --> 17:15.500
Come in, turtles.

17:16.670 --> 17:20.742
Oh, all this dampness
Is shorting out the signal.

17:20.743 --> 17:22.847
If i see one rat
Down here,

17:22.848 --> 17:25.153
Just one rat, i'll--

17:26.790 --> 17:29.327
Mama !

17:31.934 --> 17:34.138
The mighty hunter.

17:38.882 --> 17:41.619
Let's hope this nail file
Does the trick.

17:41.620 --> 17:42.956
It did it !

17:42.957 --> 17:44.727
Ah, freedom !

17:46.297 --> 17:50.070
Rats. He would
Have to leave sentries.

17:50.071 --> 17:53.077
This looks like
The only unguarded exit.

17:53.078 --> 17:55.415
Not the most inviting place
In the world,

17:55.416 --> 17:58.421
But here goes nothing.

18:00.392 --> 18:01.762
That blasted splinter.

18:01.763 --> 18:06.304
No rat has ever overcome
My control before.

18:06.305 --> 18:07.807
What's this ?

18:07.808 --> 18:09.577
She's escaped !

18:09.578 --> 18:13.085
A fine pair of sentries
You are !

18:13.086 --> 18:17.594
No more swiss cheese
For you two for a month !

18:17.595 --> 18:19.465
What's this ?

18:19.466 --> 18:23.439
Ah, so this
Is her escape route.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.777
After her !
We must catch her

18:25.778 --> 18:28.583
Before she
Locates the turtles.

18:29.821 --> 18:32.492
The subway terminal
The rat king is using

18:32.493 --> 18:34.128
Is located that way.

18:34.129 --> 18:35.965
So we'll go this way.

18:35.966 --> 18:38.637
You want to zoom
That by us again ?

18:38.638 --> 18:41.143
That way he'll have sentries
Waiting for us.

18:41.144 --> 18:43.547
This way, we can
Blind-side him.

18:45.485 --> 18:47.489
Someone's coming !
Get ready.

18:53.603 --> 18:54.704
April !

18:54.705 --> 18:56.207
That's the second
Time today

18:56.208 --> 18:57.878
You guys
Have done that !

18:57.879 --> 19:00.850
And we'll keep on doing it
Till we get it right.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.992
She couldn't
Have gotten far.

19:04.993 --> 19:08.199
Wait. I smell something.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.303
It's a woman's perfume.

19:10.304 --> 19:14.478
Heh heh. And the fragrance
Is getting closer.

19:14.479 --> 19:15.480
Got ya !

19:16.851 --> 19:18.286
Who are you ?

19:20.525 --> 19:22.027
Hey, hold on.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.465
You're that
Rat king maniac.

19:24.466 --> 19:27.471
Maniac majesty,
To you.

19:27.472 --> 19:29.042
Ok, buster.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.377
Where's my pal april ?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.582
That's what
I'd like to know.

19:32.583 --> 19:36.056
Well, there's
One way to find out.

19:36.057 --> 19:38.261
Yoo-hoo ! April !

19:38.262 --> 19:42.069
Yoo-hoo ! April !

19:42.070 --> 19:43.571
It's irma !

19:43.572 --> 19:45.743
King: where are you ?

19:45.744 --> 19:47.112
And the rat king !

19:47.113 --> 19:49.149
April,
You stay here.

19:49.150 --> 19:51.087
And miss out
On a story ?

19:51.088 --> 19:52.122
No way.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.596
Heh heh !
Now, turtles,

19:55.597 --> 19:57.266
The final showdown.

19:57.267 --> 19:58.769
A bomb !

19:58.770 --> 19:59.972
Jump !

20:08.457 --> 20:11.629
Bring her back
To the palace.

20:13.401 --> 20:15.805
Wait. I'll be
Your hostage.

20:15.806 --> 20:17.307
Take me instead.

20:17.308 --> 20:20.013
Call me when
You're a tv reporter.

20:20.014 --> 20:22.317
Men !

20:22.318 --> 20:24.556
You always go
For the redheads.

20:27.063 --> 20:28.631
Ooh, that hurt !

20:31.071 --> 20:32.439
Look out !
It's going to blow !

20:32.440 --> 20:34.577
Let's get out of here !
Come on !

20:34.578 --> 20:36.948
Where's
Everybody going ?

20:36.949 --> 20:38.718
Irma ! Run !

20:38.719 --> 20:40.622
That means you,
Dudette.

20:42.494 --> 20:45.165
Watch out !

20:45.166 --> 20:47.603
Well, so much for
The rat king.

20:47.604 --> 20:50.409
For sure,
I seriously doubt

20:50.410 --> 20:53.014
If we'll see that
Creepazoid again.

20:53.015 --> 20:54.451
I hope you're right.

20:54.452 --> 20:57.357
It's a small world
Down here in the sewers.

20:57.358 --> 20:59.128
Well, gang,
It's been fun,

20:59.129 --> 21:01.699
But i gotta get back
To the old rat race.

21:06.878 --> 21:09.382
I wonder if we'll ever run
across the rat king again.

21:09.383 --> 21:12.053
Your battle with him
was a stalemate.

21:12.054 --> 21:13.157
I fear that he might

21:13.158 --> 21:15.227
seek a future confrontation.

21:15.228 --> 21:17.732
I've already anticipated
that possibility.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.406
Holy guacamole !

21:21.407 --> 21:23.410
It's a super rodent trap,

21:23.411 --> 21:26.918
especially designed to capture 
the rat king.

21:26.919 --> 21:30.025
We just have to plant this
near his lair, and...

21:35.102 --> 21:36.872
Somehow, Donatello,

21:36.873 --> 21:38.374
I doubt that the world

21:38.375 --> 21:39.878
will beat a path to your door

21:39.879 --> 21:41.448
over this one.
