WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:01.709
- Previously,

00:01.750 --> 00:02.625
on "Henry Danger"...

00:02.667 --> 00:03.875
- Please delete my thumbprint

00:03.917 --> 00:04.625
from Henry's locker.

00:04.667 --> 00:05.917
- We're not going to be

00:05.959 --> 00:07.125
sharing a locker anymore.

00:07.166 --> 00:08.166
- What's on your head?

00:08.208 --> 00:09.959
- A glass hat.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.166
Did you use my glass hat

00:11.208 --> 00:12.417
as a bowl?

00:12.458 --> 00:14.000
- Uh...

00:14.041 --> 00:15.083
- Oh.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.125
- I thought Bianca got cast

00:16.166 --> 00:17.125
on that reality show,

00:17.166 --> 00:18.291
"Kids in the Woods."

00:18.333 --> 00:19.417
- No, no, that was Chloe.

00:19.458 --> 00:20.208
- Another girl Henry

00:20.250 --> 00:21.625
used to like.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.417
- I'm going to find Bianca

00:21.667 --> 00:23.417
and I'm gonna tell her

00:23.458 --> 00:24.041
that I lo--

00:24.083 --> 00:25.208
that I like her.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.291
- I thought you were

00:25.250 --> 00:26.291
done with Bianca.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.417
- I was, but I called her

00:27.458 --> 00:28.291
and she's coming here tonight.

00:28.333 --> 00:29.417
- Why?

00:29.458 --> 00:31.000
- So I can get back together

00:29.458 --> 00:31.000
with her.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.583
- Is that a glass hat?

00:32.625 --> 00:33.792
- The last real one in America.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.875
[ doorbell rings ]

00:34.917 --> 00:35.792
- That's Bianca.

00:35.834 --> 00:38.917
You guys have to leave before--

00:38.959 --> 00:40.542
Chloe?

00:40.583 --> 00:44.166
- I'm back from the woods.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.542
- Henry!

00:50.041 --> 00:51.125
You smashed

00:51.166 --> 00:54.208
my replacement glass hat.

00:54.250 --> 00:55.750
- Yeah, why don't I hang

00:55.792 --> 00:59.083
onto this until you calm down?

00:59.125 --> 01:00.500
- Chloe...

01:00.542 --> 01:01.500
I thought you were still

01:01.542 --> 01:03.083
in the woods doing your TV show.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.166
- Nah, we just wrapped

01:04.208 --> 01:05.333
season one last week.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.333
- Whoa. Hold on.

01:07.375 --> 01:08.333
You're the Chloe

01:08.375 --> 01:09.208
from the TV show,

01:09.250 --> 01:10.417
"Kids In The Woods"?

01:10.458 --> 01:11.291
- Yeah, she is, but--

01:11.333 --> 01:12.208
- And she's Henry's

01:12.250 --> 01:13.500
ex-girlfriend.

01:13.542 --> 01:14.709
- All right, let's not talk

01:14.750 --> 01:18.208
about who dated who.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.125
- Chloe, stay right there

01:19.166 --> 01:20.000
and don't move.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.250
I got to go get my good camera.

01:21.291 --> 01:22.208
- No, Piper,

01:22.250 --> 01:23.375
don't go get your...

01:23.417 --> 01:26.125
I can't control her.

01:26.166 --> 01:26.917
- You know, Bianca's going

01:26.959 --> 01:28.417
to be here any second.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.375
- I know. Shh.

01:31.417 --> 01:32.583
- Fine, I'll just sit back

01:32.625 --> 01:34.750
and wait for the fun.

01:34.792 --> 01:36.000
- So...

01:36.041 --> 01:38.834
Oh.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.041
- Wow.

01:40.083 --> 01:40.917
What are the flowers

01:40.959 --> 01:42.083
and candles for?

01:42.125 --> 01:43.583
- Uh...

01:43.625 --> 01:45.208
I...

01:45.250 --> 01:46.667
- Hello?

01:46.709 --> 01:48.333
- And here comes the fun.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.583
- Bianca.

01:52.625 --> 01:53.959
- Why'd you ask me

01:54.000 --> 01:54.875
to come here?

01:54.917 --> 01:55.583
- Well, you see,

01:55.625 --> 01:56.500
I didn't know that--

01:56.542 --> 01:57.583
- Chloe?

01:57.625 --> 01:58.375
- Hey, Bianca.

01:58.417 --> 01:59.250
- I didn't know

01:59.291 --> 02:00.458
you were back in town.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.542
- Neither did Henry.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.375
- I've got my good camera.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.500
Chloe, fix your makeup.

02:07.542 --> 02:08.834
- I'm not wearing makeup.

02:08.875 --> 02:11.500
- Yeah, that's my point.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.166
- Did I come at a bad time?

02:13.208 --> 02:14.291
- No.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.166
No, nothing's bad.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.208
Bianca, let's go outside.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.250
- Why?

02:17.291 --> 02:21.500
- So I can show you my porch.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.542
- It's a quality porch.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.625
- So...

02:26.667 --> 02:28.208
you're back together with Chloe?

02:28.250 --> 02:31.250
- No. Oh no.

02:31.291 --> 02:32.792
- Oh, so you had no idea

02:32.834 --> 02:33.542
she was coming here,

02:33.583 --> 02:35.542
and she just showed up?

02:35.583 --> 02:36.709
- That's exactly what happened.

02:36.750 --> 02:37.375
- Henry...

02:37.417 --> 02:40.375
- Listen...

02:40.417 --> 02:41.458
I asked you here tonight

02:41.500 --> 02:44.208
because I've been thinking.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.166
- Hey, Hen.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.500
- What?

02:46.542 --> 02:47.250
- Chloe didn't bring

02:47.291 --> 02:48.375
any makeup, so Piper

02:48.417 --> 02:49.166
wants to know if Bianca

02:49.208 --> 02:50.208
has any she can borrow.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.000
- Dude.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.250
- Sure.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.458
It's in my purse.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.333
Just give it to her.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.542
- Thanks.

02:55.583 --> 02:58.291
Chloe, I got her makeup.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.000
- Okay.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.834
I've been thinking

03:01.875 --> 03:04.917
about you and me.

03:04.959 --> 03:05.500
- Hey.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.959
Chloe's cold.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.250
- So?

03:09.291 --> 03:10.291
- Well, I see Bianca's

03:10.333 --> 03:11.834
wearing a jacket.

03:11.875 --> 03:15.166
- Oh, here.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.375
- Thanks, B.

03:16.417 --> 03:18.458
Chloe, I got her jacket.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.208
- Better talk fast

03:19.250 --> 03:21.000
before he comes back.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.250
- Okay.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.542
I was wrong to tell you

03:23.583 --> 03:25.000
that I didn't want to be

03:23.583 --> 03:25.000
boyfriend and girlfriend

03:25.041 --> 03:25.709
and I'm sorry,

03:25.750 --> 03:26.625
and I really like you,

03:26.667 --> 03:27.959
and, also, I'd be really happy

03:28.000 --> 03:28.917
if you'd be my date

03:28.959 --> 03:30.208
to the Meat Ball.

03:30.250 --> 03:30.917
- The jacket

03:30.959 --> 03:31.625
fits her perfectly.

03:31.667 --> 03:36.000
- Get off my porch.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.000
- You really want

03:37.041 --> 03:39.834
to take me to the Meat Ball?

03:39.875 --> 03:41.291
- Yeah.

03:41.333 --> 03:43.208
- And so...

03:43.250 --> 03:44.208
does that mean you want us

03:44.250 --> 03:48.583
to be, like, a thing?

03:48.625 --> 03:49.458
- I'll be your thing

03:49.500 --> 03:53.000
if you'll be my thing.

03:53.041 --> 03:54.291
- Well, then,

03:54.333 --> 03:56.375
should we make it official?

03:56.417 --> 03:57.041
- Maybe we should.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.709
- Okay.

03:58.750 --> 03:59.458
Let's update

03:59.500 --> 04:01.166
our relationship status.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.875
- Let's do it.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.333
- It all just kind of happened.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.291
- My dad was

04:05.333 --> 04:07.792
an irresponsible scientist.

04:07.834 --> 04:09.291
- I wanted an after-school job.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.166
- And by accident,

04:10.208 --> 04:11.834
he made me indestructible.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.500
Aah!

04:13.542 --> 04:15.000
- I went into this crazy store

04:15.041 --> 04:16.208
and met

04:16.250 --> 04:17.208
a pretty interesting guy.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.625
- I'm going to blow your mind.

04:18.667 --> 04:19.959
Now I protect

04:20.000 --> 04:21.375
the good citizens of Swellview

04:21.417 --> 04:22.709
who call me...

04:22.750 --> 04:24.000
- And he turned out to be...

04:24.041 --> 04:24.750
- You know the name.

04:24.792 --> 04:26.083
- Captain Man!

04:26.125 --> 04:27.125
- That's right, Henry.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.291
In time, I realized that

04:28.333 --> 04:29.834
being a superhero

04:29.875 --> 04:31.333
is a lot to handle alone.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.333
- He wanted some help.

04:32.375 --> 04:33.750
- I needed a sidekick.

04:33.792 --> 04:34.792
- I, Henry Hart...

04:34.834 --> 04:35.792
- Pledge to never ever ever

04:35.834 --> 04:36.500
tell anyone...

04:36.542 --> 04:37.500
- That I'm Captain Man's

04:37.542 --> 04:38.667
secret sidekick.

04:38.709 --> 04:39.417
- It is done.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.875
- Now we blow bubbles.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.208
- And fight crime.

04:42.250 --> 04:43.166
- Feels good.

04:57.458 --> 04:58.166
- Call it.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.583
- Up the tube!

05:00.625 --> 05:02.041
Oh, my boot.

05:02.083 --> 05:02.959
- Ha!

05:08.458 --> 05:09.875
- And...

05:09.917 --> 05:14.000
[ both ] in a relationship.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.208
- Wait.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.583
So, why is Chloe in your house?

05:16.625 --> 05:17.625
- I don't know.

05:17.667 --> 05:18.917
I'm going to go find out.

05:18.959 --> 05:19.542
- Okay.

05:19.583 --> 05:20.333
But don't forget

05:20.375 --> 05:23.792
the three-foot rule.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.333
- I promise to always stay

05:25.375 --> 05:26.000
at least three feet

05:26.041 --> 05:27.125
away from Chloe

05:27.166 --> 05:27.792
and all other girls

05:27.834 --> 05:28.583
that might like me

05:28.625 --> 05:31.208
that are not you.

05:31.250 --> 05:32.792
- Thank you.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.875
Say it again.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.166
- Now, hold this up and say,

05:37.208 --> 05:38.458
"Hey, I'm Chloe

05:38.500 --> 05:39.542
"from 'Kids In The Woods'

05:39.583 --> 05:41.000
"and this is my ceramic bunny,

05:41.041 --> 05:44.500
which you should buy."

05:44.542 --> 05:46.500
- And why am I saying that?

05:46.542 --> 05:49.625
- So I can sell it online.

05:49.667 --> 05:50.542
- You're a celebrity now.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.750
- Yeah.

05:51.792 --> 05:52.625
Idiots will pay a fortune

05:52.667 --> 05:53.542
for stuff they think

05:53.583 --> 05:55.875
was owned by a famous person.

05:55.917 --> 05:58.000
- But why should I...

05:55.917 --> 05:58.000
- Action!

05:58.041 --> 05:59.208
- Hey. I'm Chloe

05:59.250 --> 06:00.291
from "Kids In The Woods"

06:00.333 --> 06:01.500
and this is my ceramic bunny,

06:01.542 --> 06:03.417
which you should buy.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.458
Was that good?

06:04.500 --> 06:07.667
- Eh.

06:07.709 --> 06:10.166
- Hey, guys.

06:10.208 --> 06:10.750
And Chloe.

06:10.792 --> 06:12.000
- What's up?

06:12.041 --> 06:12.959
- Hey, Henry, what's up?

06:13.000 --> 06:13.792
- Hi, Henry.

06:13.834 --> 06:15.083
- So, I hear you and Bianca

06:15.125 --> 06:16.375
are officially

06:16.417 --> 06:18.333
in a relationship now.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.542
- How'd you know that?

06:23.959 --> 06:26.792
- We saw your status updates.

06:26.834 --> 06:29.166
- Yeah.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.041
So, Chloe...

06:31.083 --> 06:32.333
maybe you and I should talk?

06:32.375 --> 06:33.959
- Sure.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.458
- Action!

06:36.500 --> 06:37.542
- I need you guys to leave

06:37.583 --> 06:39.917
so I can talk to Chloe alone.

06:39.959 --> 06:41.291
- Henry, it's cool.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.750
You can relax.

06:48.417 --> 06:49.625
I'm not going to bite you.

06:49.667 --> 06:50.583
- Right, I know.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.417
It's just...

06:50.625 --> 06:52.417
- 3 foot rule?

06:52.458 --> 06:55.083
- Yeah.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.000
- Look, I didn't come here

06:56.041 --> 06:57.041
to get back together with you.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.542
- Oh.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.000
Well, great.

07:00.041 --> 07:02.625
Why not?

07:02.667 --> 07:05.000
I mean, why did you come here?

07:05.041 --> 07:06.166
- Okay, well, see,

07:06.208 --> 07:07.166
I don't know yet

07:07.208 --> 07:07.917
if they're going

07:07.959 --> 07:08.667
to make another season

07:08.709 --> 07:09.750
of "Kids In The Woods."

07:09.792 --> 07:10.625
- They better.

07:10.667 --> 07:11.917
- We have to find out

07:11.959 --> 07:12.875
if Kevin was killed

07:12.917 --> 07:13.917
by that bear.

07:13.959 --> 07:14.750
- And if Darlene's going

07:14.792 --> 07:15.583
to lose her foot.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.000
- You guys.

07:17.041 --> 07:18.583
- Anyway, I thought

07:18.625 --> 07:19.875
of a really great way

07:19.917 --> 07:21.333
to help me get publicity,

07:21.375 --> 07:22.333
which would also help

07:22.375 --> 07:23.041
"Kids In The Woods"

07:23.083 --> 07:23.750
get picked up

07:23.792 --> 07:24.792
for another season.

07:24.834 --> 07:26.375
- So, what's your plan?

07:26.417 --> 07:27.500
- To post a message online

07:27.542 --> 07:29.375
asking Kid Danger to be my date

07:29.417 --> 07:30.083
to the Meat Ball.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.500
- What?

07:31.542 --> 07:33.083
- And the fun keeps coming.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.625
- I mean, I don't know

07:34.667 --> 07:35.792
if he'll say yes.

07:35.834 --> 07:38.291
- Right, I doubt he will.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.333
- Well, that's why I'm here.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.208
Piper, are you still

07:40.250 --> 07:41.000
the President

07:41.041 --> 07:42.000
of Captain Man's fan club?

07:42.041 --> 07:43.083
- Yeah, the Man Fans.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.208
Why?

07:44.250 --> 07:45.041
- Well, I was hoping

07:45.083 --> 07:46.458
if you could help me get--

07:46.500 --> 07:49.125
- Uh, sorry, but can I have

07:49.166 --> 07:50.000
my purse and jacket back?

07:50.041 --> 07:51.959
- Oh.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.834
Sure.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.166
I hope you don't mind

07:56.208 --> 07:57.417
that I'm here.

07:57.458 --> 08:00.125
- No, it's totally fine.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.500
Three feet.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.583
- Begin.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.959
So, I saw that Kid Danger

08:31.000 --> 08:31.709
was trending

08:31.750 --> 08:33.875
all over the internet.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.417
- Yeah.

08:35.458 --> 08:36.417
You know my kind of

08:36.458 --> 08:37.417
ex-girlfriend, Chloe?

08:37.458 --> 08:38.250
- The one who's

08:38.291 --> 08:39.542
on "Kids In The Woods" now?

08:39.583 --> 08:41.000
- Yeah.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.125
She wants me--

08:42.166 --> 08:43.166
well, she wants Kid Danger

08:43.208 --> 08:44.542
to take her to the Meat Ball

08:44.583 --> 08:45.583
so she can get publicity

08:45.625 --> 08:46.458
for her show.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.417
Ow.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.250
- So, you going to take her?

08:52.291 --> 08:53.750
- No, I can't. Ow.

08:53.792 --> 08:56.458
Ow.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.959
Because I'm taking Bianca,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.750
as me.

09:00.792 --> 09:02.000
- Well, why not take

09:02.041 --> 09:03.792
both girls? Ow.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.667
- Because there's only...

09:05.709 --> 09:07.125
one me.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.667
- Not exactly.

09:08.709 --> 09:11.166
There's two of you.

09:11.208 --> 09:11.750
There's Henry.

09:11.792 --> 09:13.166
Ow.

09:13.208 --> 09:14.250
- [ laughs ]

09:14.291 --> 09:15.542
- And Kid Danger.

09:15.583 --> 09:16.875
- So you're saying I should

09:16.917 --> 09:19.291
take Bianca as myself

09:19.333 --> 09:22.125
and Chloe as Kid Danger?

09:22.166 --> 09:23.709
- Exactly.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.291
- That does it.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.125
- [ both ] Ow, ow, ow.

09:31.917 --> 09:34.500
- Dang.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.083
- What is the matter with you?

09:36.125 --> 09:37.166
- Henry is not going

09:37.208 --> 09:37.834
to take two girls

09:37.875 --> 09:38.583
to the same party.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.667
- But he can, because--

09:39.709 --> 09:41.125
- No.

09:41.166 --> 09:41.875
I've seen this happen

09:41.917 --> 09:45.166
on a dozen bad TV shows.

09:45.208 --> 09:46.917
And it never works.

09:46.959 --> 09:47.834
- But that's just

09:47.875 --> 09:49.667
bad television.

09:49.709 --> 09:52.583
This is very different.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.458
- So, what should I do?

09:54.500 --> 09:55.750
- Okay, you start off the party

09:55.792 --> 09:56.959
taking Chloe as Kid Danger.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.125
- Okay.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.208
- Don't do it.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.709
- People take a bunch of pics,

10:00.750 --> 10:02.166
post them online, so she gets

10:02.208 --> 10:03.083
the publicity that she wants.

10:03.125 --> 10:04.083
- Right.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.417
- Wrong.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.792
- Then, after a few minutes,

10:06.834 --> 10:08.208
I'll call you up as Captain Man

10:08.250 --> 10:09.500
and make up some big emergency

10:09.542 --> 10:10.667
that I need your help with.

10:10.709 --> 10:11.709
- Please no.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.208
- And then I leave,

10:13.250 --> 10:14.166
change back into my normal self.

10:14.208 --> 10:14.959
- Yep.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.166
- Nope.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.083
- And I spend the rest

10:17.125 --> 10:18.542
of the Meat Ball with Bianca.

10:18.583 --> 10:19.125
- It's perfect.

10:19.166 --> 10:19.917
- I'm doing it.

10:19.959 --> 10:20.583
- I'm liking it.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.500
- I'm going home.

10:37.583 --> 10:38.834
- Hey, Jasper.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.917
- Oh, hi, Bianca.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.917
Oh, this lamb is so good.

10:43.959 --> 10:44.834
Sniff it.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.083
- Yeah, that smells great.

10:50.125 --> 10:50.959
Thanks.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.125
- Sure.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.333
Where's Henry?

10:53.375 --> 10:54.375
- Oh, his boss made him

10:54.417 --> 10:55.834
work late at Junk-N-Stuff,

10:55.875 --> 10:57.834
so he said he'd meet me here.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.667
- Classic Henry.

11:00.709 --> 11:02.500
- Attention!

11:02.542 --> 11:04.500
Attention, everyone!

11:04.542 --> 11:05.458

11:33.625 --> 11:35.417
why my phone is ringing.

11:35.458 --> 11:36.250
Excuse me.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.625
- Yeah, sure.

There is a big emergency

What's the emergency?

12:03.625 --> 12:05.500
- A blah, blah, blah.

- Chief Sullivan,

12:38.417 --> 12:39.125
what are you doing--

12:39.166 --> 12:40.125
- As the police chief

12:40.166 --> 12:41.041
of Swellview,

12:41.083 --> 12:42.291
and as one of your chaperones

12:42.333 --> 12:43.709
here at the Meat Ball,

12:43.750 --> 12:45.250
I say you deserve

12:45.291 --> 12:47.166

then leave for a minute.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.333
- Okay.

- Then change back

- No.

- What? Why not?

- Hey, Charlotte.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.041
Do you have any idea

15:27.083 --> 15:28.500
where Henry is?

15:28.542 --> 15:30.625
He's over an hour late.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.750
- No, sorry.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.959
But maybe Kid Danger

15:35.000 --> 15:36.208
should go search the school

15:36.250 --> 15:37.500
and see if he can find Henry.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.000
- Yes, I should.

I'll go see if I can find

what he looks like.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.458
- That is true.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.792
- So I'll go with you.

15:55.583 --> 15:56.959
- Hey, guys, what goes on?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.834
- Mm.

15:58.875 --> 15:59.542
- Henry is missing,

15:59.583 --> 16:00.583
so Kid Danger and I

16:00.625 --> 16:02.000
are going to go look for him.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.000

Henry, are you here?

Henry?

16:21.041 --> 16:22.083
Well, he doesn't seem

16:22.125 --> 16:23.667
to be here, so why don't you two

16:23.709 --> 16:25.542
give up and walk away?

16:25.583 --> 16:26.375
- Here.

16:26.417 --> 16:27.208
I'll try calling him again.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.291
- No.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.125
- Why not?

16:29.166 --> 16:30.583

Oh my God.

- Uh...

16:52.125 --> 16:53.750
I can't because

there's a very bad guy out here.

17:19.458 --> 17:22.583
you can't get one meatball?

17:22.625 --> 17:24.417
- Why does the water

17:22.625 --> 17:24.417
have to be boiling?

17:24.458 --> 17:26.542
- To keep the meatballs warm.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.625
Go again.

Is that necessary?

17:43.291 --> 17:44.375

17:44.417 --> 17:46.875
- Aw, man, what now?

17:46.917 --> 17:48.208
- I panicked, so I threw Chloe

17:48.250 --> 17:49.208

17:49.250 --> 17:50.583
and locked them inside.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.000
- Are they alive?

17:52.041 --> 17:53.041
- Yes.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.375
I told them

17:54.417 --> 17:55.208
I was protecting them

17:55.250 --> 17:56.667

17:56.709 --> 17:58.208

phones away from them?

18:01.083 --> 18:02.250
- No, why?

18:02.291 --> 18:04.000

there's some real bad guy here

18:16.667 --> 18:17.542
trying to hurt you.

Wait.

go open the closet
