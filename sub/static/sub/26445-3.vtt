[Nick] Gina did the funniest thing
last night.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.847
I asked her what she was doing
this summer

00:13.930 --> 00:15.807
and she sent me
an ISIS recruitment video.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.225
-Ha-ha. That's funny.
-Right?

00:17.308 --> 00:19.436
Man, they're gonna be the end
of civilization.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.354
-Nick! Over here! Alley-oop!
-[Nick grunts]

00:21.438 --> 00:22.647
[Jay groans]

00:22.731 --> 00:25.442
I should've filmed that.
Gina loves basketball fails.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.862
Hey, um, isn't she kind of with DeVon now?

00:28.945 --> 00:33.616
Oh, yeah. I heard they cheesed each other
in the library until it was hot fondue.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.744
-I don't think that's true.
-But they are dating.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.079
That's fine. We're friends for now.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.206
Nick is right. Even if a guy likes me,

00:40.290 --> 00:41.624
-we can still be friends.
-Totally.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.626
I'm friends with
a lot of guys that like me.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.211
Oh, yeah.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.173
[Maury grunts]

00:48.590 --> 00:51.468
Did you notice that some of the butt
is on the outside of the bathing suit?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.762
I did. You have a keen eye for detail.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.306
-How the light glints off of her mound.
-Okay. God.

00:56.389 --> 01:00.769
Nick, you're such a sucker.
Gina is using you for your friendship.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.855
-She's putting you in the friend zone.
-Friend zones are not a real thing, Jay.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.356
You mean like the J-spot?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.984
I think you mean the G-spot,
and maybe that's real?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.903
-I don't know.
-No, I mean the J-spot.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.280
All I know is,
I actually like getting to know Gina.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.198
-What?
-For real.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.449
I'm so proud of you, Nicholas!

01:14.532 --> 01:17.160
And the G-spot is very real.
Ask your mother.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.661
She's hit mine several times.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.497
-Gross.
-Who wants a quinoa burger?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.373
Well, if lunch is almost ready,

01:22.457 --> 01:24.918
I am going to pop over
to the little boy's room.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.295
-I'm sorry I said that.
-Just pee in the pool, dude.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.421
No, Jay. That's gross.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.882
I've literally been peeing
through this entire conversation.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.426
-Jay!
-I think I'm sick. It just won't stop.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.428
-Jesus.
-I have been drinking a lot of pool water.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.140
They never keep the good drugs
in the pool house.

01:39.224 --> 01:43.603
[gasps] Hark! I am the beast,
and Leah's bathing suit, 'tis the sun.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.355
[gasps]
Half of her ass was in there.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.481
You should take a whiff.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.150
No! I'm not gonna do that.
Nick's whole family is out there.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.194
Come on. Did you see the wedgie she had?

01:51.277 --> 01:53.947
-That chip was dragged through the salsa.
-Oh!

01:54.030 --> 01:56.074
Wow, it sure was though, wasn't it?

01:56.157 --> 01:58.493
Come on, it's just us.
Nobody's gonna know.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.411
-Eat up, fat boy.
-Yeah, I could have a snack.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.163
-Here we go. Take a whiff.
-[sniffs]

02:02.247 --> 02:03.498
Well? What say you?

02:03.581 --> 02:05.166
It mostly just smells like chlorine,

02:05.250 --> 02:08.002
but I know that her wet naked body
was against it.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.462
Good boy. Make it personal.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.132
Leah thinks it's responsible
that you wear a UV shirt.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.134
Yes, she does,
'cause taking care of your skin

02:14.217 --> 02:15.593
means you take care of yourself.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.388
-And Leah notices that.
-And her skin is so beautiful.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.515
Yeah, the mom's skin is not bad either.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.058
-No, not the mom. Leah!

-Finish.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.738
-Absolutely not. This is a nightmare.
-A nightmare is not finishing.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.615
-It's unhealthy.
-We've gotta get out of here.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.492
I don't see a sign anywhere that says,
"Don't jerk off to our daughter."

03:21.576 --> 03:22.577
It's implied!

03:22.660 --> 03:24.621
Well, they gotta make
this stuff clear, friend.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.456
Oh, my God.

03:26.539 --> 03:30.001
Dr. Birch, can I eat my quinoa burger
in the pool? I'm still peeing.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.961
Jay, honey,
I'm honestly a little concerned.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.089
It's nothing to worry about.
I pee once a week for half an hour.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.133
-You have no upper body strength.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.805
[Andrew] Okay, calm down, Andrew.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.974
Maybe she thought
I was just peeing against the wall.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.101
Or scratching my penis
with a very sturdy grip.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.146
-It's going to be fine.
-[Shame Wizard] No, it's not.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.815
-What?
-[echoing] She saw everything.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.944
-Who said that?
-She's going to tell everyone.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.451
Hey, Jay, let me guess.
You've glued your elbows to your knees?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.036
No, I'm waiting for my mom.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.456
While you're waiting, you wanna help me
put away the band-minton equint-ment?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.959
Oh, I think it's badminton.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.086
No, this is a bad mitten.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.005
Let's go put our hands
all over a newborn baby

09:08.089 --> 09:10.424
-when we got a horrible cold.
-Whoa.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.928
I know!
This guy, he's such a bad mitten, right?

09:14.011 --> 09:17.223
Why don't you shut your fucking mustache,
you piece of shit.

09:17.723 --> 09:21.227
Hey, Mom? Have you ever done something
that you, you know, regretted?

09:21.310 --> 09:23.771
-What'd you do, you little pervert?
-Don't tell me, Andrew.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.481
Whatever you did, don't ever tell me.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.276
No, I'm just asking
if you've ever felt ashamed?

09:28.359 --> 09:31.279
I'm ashamed of everything,
it's my great shame.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.364
Don't ask your mother about shame.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.116
That's why I pay synagogue dues.

09:35.199 --> 09:38.369
So you can talk to Rabbi Poblart
if you have a problem.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.038
-But you don't pay synagogue dues.
-You're damn right! I don't!

09:41.122 --> 09:42.373
And I'm not gonna pay a dime.

09:42.456 --> 09:45.251
Not until Poblart gives up
one of his three parking spots.

09:45.334 --> 09:49.922
We wandered the desert for 40 years,
so that this man can park at a diagonal?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.007
-[whirring]
-[beeping]

09:51.090 --> 09:53.092
-[man 1] That hooker's dead, bro.
-Estoy aqui.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.260
Grab the coins, man.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.429
[speaking Spanish]

09:56.512 --> 09:58.264
Mike, Carlos, Abuela,

09:58.347 --> 09:59.849
-this is Nick.
-Hey.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.767
Nick, these are my brothers
and my grandma.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.186
Now which one is which?
I'm kidding, of course.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.980
-You must be Mike.
-Que?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.315
I've heard so much about you.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.859
Vamos a estudiar in el cuarto, Abuela.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.194
Okay, tenio seguro.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.321
What'd she say?

10:13.404 --> 10:16.240
I'm not supposed to have boys in my room,
but she says it's okay

10:16.324 --> 10:18.117
because you are a safe boy.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.454
-Aah!
-Ay, Dios mio! The Taco Bell dog.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.372
-[door opens]
-Sorry, my room's a mess.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.832
-Sleepover.
-What?

10:24.915 --> 10:26.751
-That's just my little sister Tanya.
-Sleepover.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.877
[grunts]

10:27.960 --> 10:29.420
-Sleepover!
-Tanya, what did we talk--

10:29.503 --> 10:30.796
-She's very strong.
-I'm sorry.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.548
Tanya's watching
a ton of cholita wrestling

10:32.632 --> 10:34.925
where these Bolivian women fight
in their church clothes.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.886
-Tanya, let him go!
-She's adorable.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.387
Sleepover.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.515
Your friends suck.
Your family sucks.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.392
This pharmacy sucks!

10:43.476 --> 10:46.646
-I know. My life sucks.
-You know what doesn't suck?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.731
-That lip gloss.
-I don't have enough money.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.941
Who said anything about money, honey?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.735
You got five fingers, don't you?

10:52.818 --> 10:55.738
Actually, I have four,
but that's standard animation stuff.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.950
Steal that lip gloss. Flavor: Bubblegum.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.619
You mean like shoplifting?

11:01.702 --> 11:04.080
No! I mean like pharmacy stealing.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.331
-Fuck it!
-I don't know.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.250
-Fuck all these fucking fucks!
-What if I get caught?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.503
That's what makes it so exciting.

11:10.586 --> 11:14.882
Like screwing a stranger
at a minor league baseball game.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.467
-What? Ew.
-Baby steps.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.344
First, steal that lip gloss!

11:19.053 --> 11:21.180
[sighs] Okay. Here we go.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.434
Smooth. Now walk to the door, be cool.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.603
-[Jessi humming]
-[Hormone] Yeah, smile. Not that big.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.689
Head down. Don't look her in the eye.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.524
Don't look away.
All right, now get out!

11:31.607 --> 11:33.484
Get the fuck out! Go! Move!

11:33.901 --> 11:35.528
[panting]

11:36.237 --> 11:37.405
I'm out!

11:37.488 --> 11:38.989
Well, how do you feel?

11:39.073 --> 11:41.325
I feel... I feel amazing.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.245
-Is this how men feel?
-All the time!

11:44.328 --> 11:46.872
-Even the ugly ones.
-Mm. [clicks tongue]

11:46.956 --> 11:47.957
Bubblegum.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.668
Bubbleguuuuuuuum!

11:50.751 --> 11:53.587
So what's the difference
between a mutation and an adaptation?

11:53.671 --> 11:54.630
It's funny you ask,

11:54.714 --> 11:57.508
-because I don't know and I don't care.
-We literally just sat down.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.219
I know, but all this stuff
is on Planet Earth on Netflix.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.430
It's gonna be so much more fun
to watch it.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.266
It's like science class
without all that pesky reading.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.144
Because technically, I am,
you know, illiterate.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.270
[giggles] Coach Steve.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.272
Yeah, we don't have Netflix.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.274
You don't have Netflix?
That's impossible.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.693
I mean, from Roku to Apple TV
to your home computer,

12:15.776 --> 12:18.279
Gina, streaming on Netflix
has never been easier.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.322
-This Netflix. It sounds expensive.
-Ha-ha.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.199
You'd think so, but it's not, Gina.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.869
And best of all,
you get five unique user profiles,

12:24.952 --> 12:27.037
or I could just give you
my password for--

12:27.121 --> 12:28.956
SCENE REDACTED

12:29.039 --> 12:31.292
[narrator on TV]
The female bird fails to see

12:31.375 --> 12:33.753
this beta male as a potential mate.

12:33.836 --> 12:34.962
Ah!

12:35.045 --> 12:38.674
But the beta has an evolutionary trick
up its sleeve.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.217
[beta male screeching]

12:40.301 --> 12:42.344
Nick, you're like that bird, bro.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.514
Yeah, trying to get with our sister.
That fucking jacket.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.391
-Callete la boca!
-If I'm that bird,

12:47.475 --> 12:48.934
you guys are those two possums

12:49.018 --> 12:50.853
eating bugs out of each other's butts.

12:50.978 --> 12:54.106
-Gina, I like this little dude.
-Yeah, me too.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.233
Your jacket's working.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.695
[narrator on TV]
And so the two birds begin to fuck.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.197
[female bird screeching]

13:01.906 --> 13:03.491
Sleepover.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.161
[Andrew] Rabbi Poblart,
what does Torah say about sin?

13:07.244 --> 13:08.537
My dear Andrew,

13:08.621 --> 13:12.082
what's a sin is the parking situation
at the synagogue.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.543
-I'm sorry. I don't--
-My adult son, Leo,

13:14.627 --> 13:17.129
should park on the street
like a common criminal?

13:17.213 --> 13:19.048
I was talking about masturbation.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.592
People are masturbating
in the parking spaces now?

13:21.675 --> 13:23.594
-No.
-Is it Leo?

13:23.677 --> 13:24.887
-What?
-He's very nervous

13:24.970 --> 13:26.555
about going on Fish Tank,

13:26.639 --> 13:29.099
which is the Jewish version of Shark Tank.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.895
I just want to talk to you, Rabbi,
about how I feel ashamed of who I am.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.355
Shame? Nay, nay.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.981
Jews, we do not feel shame.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.109
We feel guilt.
Like how you should feel guilt

13:39.193 --> 13:41.821
for not investing
in Leo's business venture:

13:41.904 --> 13:44.073
Wigs for religious dogs.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.243
-But I don't have any money.
-Neither, my friend, does Leo.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.995
If you want to talk shame,
go to the Catholics.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.664
If you want to talk dog wigs,

13:51.747 --> 13:52.915
-go to Leo.
-What?

13:52.998 --> 13:56.877
But do not go alone,
for one should have fear of Leo.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.255
[both grunt]

13:59.380 --> 14:02.466
-Hey, we broke our record.
-Yeah! [chuckles]

14:03.008 --> 14:05.344
Hey, I'm sorry my mom is so late
picking me up.

14:05.427 --> 14:09.181
She's probably, you know,
at the kids store buying my feed.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.933
[chuckles]
That's something moms do, right?

14:11.016 --> 14:14.353
Yeah, real mom stuff. Totally understand.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.940
'Cause my mom,
she would feed me too, you know? So...

14:18.816 --> 14:21.652
But hey, we're having fun, right?

14:21.735 --> 14:23.612
-Yeah!
-You wanna see a magic trick?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.613
I don't know.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.448
Okay, check it out.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.491
[exclaims]

14:27.575 --> 14:29.994
-Why did you do that?
-Wait! What do you mean?

14:30.077 --> 14:32.371
I don't know. I didn't like that.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.998
It's okay. It's not real.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.749
[stuttering]

14:37.084 --> 14:38.252
[stammering] It's not?

14:38.335 --> 14:40.963
-No! It's a trick, see?
-A trick?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.048
I mean I'm not supposed
to reveal my secret,

14:43.132 --> 14:46.468
but look, the shuttlecocks's now
right up my sleeve.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.595
[gasping]

14:47.678 --> 14:49.096
-Wow!
-Yeah.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.850
I can't believe you would break
The Magician's Code for me.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.519
I mean that's like
something you would do...

14:55.811 --> 14:56.896
for a friend?

14:56.979 --> 14:58.731
Yeah! Yeah!

14:58.814 --> 15:00.941
-Yeah, we're friends!
-Best friends.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.527
-Sure! Fuck everybody else!
-Eh!

15:03.611 --> 15:06.030
My best friend is an adult man!

15:06.113 --> 15:08.991
And my best friend is an unclaimed child!

15:09.074 --> 15:11.577
I hope your mom never picks you up, Jay.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.495
-How was your day, sweetie?
-Hi.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.581
-What's on your lips?
-Bubblegum lip gloss.

15:15.664 --> 15:16.749
Where'd you get that?

15:16.832 --> 15:19.585
-Missy gave it to me.
-I didn't know Missy wore lip gloss.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.795
She doesn't.
That's why she gave it to me.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.758
Nice. Now lie to her
for no fucking reason, whatsoever.

15:25.841 --> 15:29.261
By the way, that new mac and cheese
restaurant is finally open.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.679
Ooh! Mac and cheese.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.972
-Do you wanna go?
-Nope.

15:32.056 --> 15:32.932
Hah!

15:33.557 --> 15:35.559
Uh... Forgive me, Father,

15:35.643 --> 15:38.646
for I was looking at my best friend's
sister's bathing suit

15:38.729 --> 15:41.649
and I fell prey to masturbation.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.484
Got it. Do five Our Fathers.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.027
-Uh, that's it?
-That's it.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.613
I'm sorry... That's Catholicism?

15:47.696 --> 15:50.324
-[Father] Wait, are you not Catholic?
-If you must know, I'm Jewish.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.827
-[Father] Oh... Jewish!
-What does that mean?

15:53.911 --> 15:56.747
[Father] I'm not surprised you're in here
trying to get advice for free.

15:56.830 --> 15:57.998
Oh, okay.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.209
You want to trade in stereotypes,
old man?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.836
Well, I bet you,
I bet you have sex with little boys.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.089
-Old man? I'm 32!
-Big wow!

16:05.172 --> 16:07.800
-I've boned down with grown ass women.
-Oh, who cares?

16:07.883 --> 16:09.635
-Divorcees.
-You're disgusting.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.262
You doubt me, man?
I got a picture of panties right here.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.973
-I'm out of here.
-Don't you go anywhere.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.683
It's from a couple of weeks ago. Hold on.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.977
-I'm not waiting for the picture.
-See that? Look at that.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.687
You tell me I fuck little boys.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.188
-Those are shorts.
-These are shorts.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.815
I'm looking at it now. These are shorts.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.650
I can't believe I waited around
for a priest

16:24.733 --> 16:26.443
to show me a pantie picture.
I'm out of here.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.446
You know what? If I did fuck little boys,
you wouldn't be one of them.

16:29.530 --> 16:33.033
A lot of adult men would be attracted
to me and this big can of mine.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.868
What a jerk. [sighs deeply]

16:34.952 --> 16:36.787
-I just want to feel better.
-[thunder rumbles]

16:36.870 --> 16:39.039
[Shame Wizard] You'll never feel better.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.041
-[gasps] Stop it!
-You're ratchet!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.042
Leave me alone.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.963
You should be ashamed of yourself,
you sinful little creature!

16:46.046 --> 16:47.047
[exclaiming]

16:47.506 --> 16:49.341
[wind whooshes]

16:49.508 --> 16:53.178
I just wanted to touch myself in public.
Is that so wrong?

16:53.262 --> 16:56.932
[man] Stop quoting
your friend's dad's law commercials.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.729
[panting] Cramps.
How can a child be in such bad shape?

17:03.605 --> 17:05.274
Thank goodness. I made it.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.317
-Congratulations.
-[exclaims]

17:07.401 --> 17:09.403
-Who are you?
-Who, I?

17:09.486 --> 17:13.824
Andrew, I'm the Shame Wizard, of course.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.743
-The Shame Wizard?
-[evil laughter]

17:15.826 --> 17:18.203
[high-pitched voice]
The Shame Wizard!

17:18.287 --> 17:19.329
Oh!

17:19.413 --> 17:23.167
Yes, Andrew,
and I've been waiting for you.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.918
-You have?
-Oh, yes.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.337
-Oh, God.
-Surely you knew I was coming.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.672
I didn't. I wouldn't--

17:28.756 --> 17:31.216
Now come with me, young man.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.970
I'm taking you
to that new mac and cheese restaurant.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.055
-Really?
-Nope.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.931
[gavel thudding]

17:38.015 --> 17:38.849
[exclaiming]

17:38.932 --> 17:41.268
-Where am I?
-All rise.

17:41.351 --> 17:44.813
-Shame Court is now in session.
-What?

17:44.897 --> 17:48.067
The honorable Shame Wizard presiding.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.235
-Shame Court?
-Silence!

17:50.319 --> 17:54.156
Thus begins the trial
of Andrew Glouberman

17:54.239 --> 17:59.411
who stands accused
of being a loathsome little pervert.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.412
[gasps]

18:00.496 --> 18:01.580
That was really fun.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.624
-My family likes you.
-I don't know if you noticed,

18:03.707 --> 18:06.085
but I think
Tanya might wanna have a sleepover.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.586
That might be fun.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.380
I'll only do it if I can take an ice bath
with your grandma.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.174
-[laughs]
-[chance-o-meter dings]

18:12.299 --> 18:14.134
This is your big chance, Nick.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.929
Eat her chin! Pinch her in the butt.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.225
-Hey G.
-Hey D!

18:21.558 --> 18:23.560
-D's here.
-Cool jacket.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.730
I think my uncle had the same one
when he was Sinbad for Halloween.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.066
I think it's kind of weird
you're that close to your uncle.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.819
My dad wasn't around,
but I'm just wanna be that guy.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.445
There's nothing I can say back to that.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.571
-Okay, ha-ha.
-All right.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.157
Nick, looks like your bus is here.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.659
Thanks again. I had fun.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.369
-Yeah. Me, too.
-Bye.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.328
Bye.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.498
[air hisses]

18:46.834 --> 18:48.460
[buzzing]

18:48.544 --> 18:51.505
Oh no! This bus can't slow down...

18:51.630 --> 18:53.090
the matriots, baby.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.510
-[gavel pounding]
-Ladies and gentlemen...

18:56.593 --> 18:58.595
over the millennia,

18:58.679 --> 19:03.934
I have seen many good people
do terrible things,

19:04.226 --> 19:06.145
but the State shall prove

19:06.228 --> 19:09.940
that Andrew Glouberman
didn't do a bad thing...

19:10.023 --> 19:14.194
-Yeah.
-[high-pitched voice] He is a bad thing!

19:14.528 --> 19:15.404
Objection.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.865
[gasps] Oh, thank God, Maury.
You're here.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.866
Are you my lawyer?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.450
-Am I your lawyer?
-Oh, please--

19:20.576 --> 19:21.994
Seriously, am I your lawyer?

19:22.077 --> 19:24.621
I was told we were going
to a new mac and cheese restaurant.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.124
How does the defendant plead?

19:27.207 --> 19:29.209
Not creepy, your honor.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.379
I'm sorry. I couldn't find a sitter.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.548
One, two, three...
I'm missing a dick.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.383
Everyone, check their butts.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.093
I am so screwed.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.512
[man] Hey kid, this is your stop.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.932
The Friend Zone?
No, I don't want to get off here.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.684
Well, I could take you to the Alone Zone,

19:45.767 --> 19:48.520
but that's just a tent
where you jerk off to vacation photos

19:48.604 --> 19:49.897
-of your ex on Facebook.
-What?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.649
They serve microwave nachos
and it's freezing in there.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.859
Okay, I'll get off here.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.319
FRIEND ZONE

19:56.320 --> 19:57.821
Welcome to the Friend Zone.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.241
This will vibrate when Gina's ready
to be more than friends.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.618
It never vibrates.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.453
Over here is the grey area,

20:04.536 --> 20:06.663
where people parse the meaning
of ambiguous texts.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.083
So there are two exclamation points,
but then the Emoji with no mouth.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.461
So does he want to hang out tomorrow?
Why doesn't he say it?

20:12.544 --> 20:15.255
Or does he want to when he's back
from his trip? And is there even one?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.673
Oh God, this is sad.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.593
You know what, actually, scroll up
to that text where he calls you "dude."

20:19.676 --> 20:20.969
That's what we should focus on.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.388
-I got to get out of here.
-Yeah, good call.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.265
Look, there's the Fuck Zone.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.934
Let's roll over there, baby.

20:27.017 --> 20:27.976
FUCK ZONE

20:28.227 --> 20:29.686
[moaning]

20:31.021 --> 20:32.147
[grunts]

20:32.231 --> 20:33.482
Oh my God!

20:33.857 --> 20:36.860
-We can still make it. [grunts]
-Rick, just stop.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.278
What are you gonna do?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.739
-Oh, God.
-[Rick] At least my crotch is okay.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.366
[hawk screeching]

20:42.699 --> 20:43.533
[clears throat]

20:43.617 --> 20:47.579
I'm Andrews father's associate, Susan.
He masturbates to me every night.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.874
Objection! He masturbates to her
during the day as well.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.878
Oh God. I need outside counsel.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.630
I am VIP Cam Girl.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.715
All day I deal with pervert,

20:58.799 --> 21:02.094
but Andrew, he is most pervert.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.680
-Can I smoke from my vagina?
-No!

21:04.763 --> 21:06.556
Andrew let me do it. [chuckles]

21:06.640 --> 21:10.227
-Jesus Christ.
-I was curious about the mechanics of it.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.520
[sock 1] He singled me out.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.981
He separated me from my partner.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.941
That's what they do, you know?

21:16.024 --> 21:19.403
And then he used me like an object.

21:19.486 --> 21:23.699
I mean, obviously I am an object,
but for feet, not for... [crying]

21:23.782 --> 21:25.450
There, there. It's all right.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.619
I'm sorry, can I...

21:27.744 --> 21:29.204
Can I smoke from my vagina?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.831
Of course. Please.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.000
He was my brother's best friend.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.835
We treated him like family.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.254
And in kind, he honored that?

21:37.337 --> 21:39.339
No! He jerked off all over the house!

21:39.423 --> 21:40.674
-[crowd gasps]
-[man] Jerked off?

21:40.757 --> 21:42.050
And to think,

21:42.134 --> 21:45.012
-you were going to take him to Hamilton.
-She was?

21:45.095 --> 21:46.930
Then I was maybe
going to take him to Starbucks.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.181
No! The ideal date!

21:48.265 --> 21:49.349
Thank you, Leah.

21:49.433 --> 21:53.270
The prosecution would now
like to call its final witness.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.438
Oh, thank God.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.440
Andrew Glouberman!

21:56.523 --> 21:58.150
-[gasps]
-Oh dear God!

21:58.358 --> 22:00.652
[grunts] It was in my own butt.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.112
-You scared me!
-[penis whimpering]

22:02.195 --> 22:04.823
Buddy, I'm not mad. I was just worried.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.325
Hey Mom.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.993
Sorry, I'm late.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.287
That's okay.
I had a great time with my new friend.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.789
You got a super-duper kid,
Mrs. Jay's mom.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.333
Thank you, Mister...

22:14.416 --> 22:17.085
It's Steve. Mr. Coach Steve-Steve.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.338
-[chuckles]
-You can call me Coach Steve.

22:19.421 --> 22:23.967
Well, any friend of Jay's
is a friend of mine, Steve.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.928
[laughs] Another friend?
When it rains, it pours.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.182
-Bye-bye, Coach Steve.
-Bye-bye, Mrs. Jay's Mom-Mom.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.726
Hey, let's buy a dog from a puppy mill

22:32.809 --> 22:34.686
and say we got it from a shelter.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.813
No! I just made two new friends.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.775
I don't need you anymore, Bad Mitten.
[grunts]

22:40.359 --> 22:42.235
Oh you're dead, Steve.

22:42.319 --> 22:46.365
I'm going to kill you before you lose
your virginity next episode.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.909
Whoa! You don't like spoilers?

22:48.992 --> 22:50.827
Well, let me explain this to you.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.537
I'm not a good mitten.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.247
I'm a bad mitten.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.916
[evil laughter]

22:55.999 --> 22:57.459
[hawk screeching]

22:57.709 --> 22:58.919
[bone snapping]

22:59.711 --> 23:02.297
Still don't think I'm a bad mitten?

23:02.381 --> 23:06.635
Then stick around
and watch me fuck this dead bird.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.304
Mr. Glouberman!

23:09.388 --> 23:12.307
Don't tell a little kid
about mac and cheese restaurant.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.476
-Why would you promise that?
-[laughing]

23:15.435 --> 23:17.354
Andrew, my boy,

23:17.437 --> 23:21.149
we've heard but a fraction
of the many wretched things you've done

23:21.233 --> 23:24.152
-in your pathetic life.
-Oh, God.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.238
And now I only have one question...

23:26.738 --> 23:30.325
Do you believe you're a good person?

23:30.409 --> 23:33.412
-I think--
-I will remind you that you're under oath!

23:33.495 --> 23:35.705
-I wanna be a good person.
-Do you?

23:35.789 --> 23:41.253
Because I believe you wish to drench
this entire planet in your rotten jizz.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.422
Isn't that true, Mr. Glouberman?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.048
No, that's a half truth!

23:45.132 --> 23:46.007
[all gasps]

23:46.091 --> 23:49.970
May the records show that
the defendant has a poorly timed erection.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.847
-[typewriter clacking]
-Do not write that down!

23:51.930 --> 23:54.766
-You got a boner from this?
-There is no denying it.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.352
You are irredeemable.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.480
I know that. Don't you think I know that?

24:00.564 --> 24:02.023
I have no self-control.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.985
I could jerk off to anything in here.
I could jerk off to all of you.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.696
I'll probably jerk off
to this whole experience.

24:07.779 --> 24:08.822
[all gasps]

24:08.947 --> 24:09.865
Why is that?

24:09.948 --> 24:12.200
-Because I'm a creep, okay?
-Oh, yes.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.286
-I'm a pervert!
-Yes, Andrew.

24:14.369 --> 24:17.664
And maybe at the end of the day,
I'm just a bad person.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.875
Yes! You're a bad person!

24:19.958 --> 24:21.877
And not a great guy at all.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.795
You're just reshuffling the words.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.714
Oh God, what have I done?

24:25.797 --> 24:27.799
[all] Guilty!

24:30.719 --> 24:32.721
Andrew! Stop judging yourself.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.264
No!

24:34.931 --> 24:38.185
I'm a not great guy.

24:41.229 --> 24:44.107
She deserves it, and so do we.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.400
We totally do.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.113
Gina
Heyyy... I think I like like you.

24:50.238 --> 24:53.241
And if you don't like me like that
I don't know if we can be friends.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.339
[crying]

25:09.216 --> 25:11.843
-I'm sorry, Andrew.
-It's okay.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.470
No, I made in the crate.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.138
Shut up, Maurice.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.391
Don't you see he's mine now? You both are.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.268
[evil laughter]

25:20.602 --> 25:23.438
Okay, it's just that it's caked to my fur.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.731
[crying and masturbating]

25:24.814 --> 25:26.691
