WEBVTT

02:29.774 --> 02:31.692
Hmm?

02:51.212 --> 02:53.046
Aah!

02:55.383 --> 02:56.675
The Mandarin!

03:04.893 --> 03:07.728
Yeah, looks like
we're gonna need

03:07.812 --> 03:09.938
someone else on the temple.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.274
Mr. Thodey!

03:12.358 --> 03:14.026
Mr. Thodey.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.238
lt's Mr. Thodes
or just Thodey,

03:18.323 --> 03:19.781
not both, remember?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.658
The rains are
nearly upon us,

03:21.743 --> 03:23.827
and you are very far
behind schedule.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.162
Not my fault.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.998
lf the underground rivers
continue to swell,

03:28.082 --> 03:29.333
the ruins will collapse.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.001
Mr. Tony promised you would--

03:31.085 --> 03:33.962
You wanna blame someone,
try the Jade Dragons.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.297
Their little commando raids

03:35.381 --> 03:36.632
have cost us weeks.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.469
That is a security issue,
and Mr. Tony promised us--

03:40.553 --> 03:41.595
l know.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.181
He promised a lot of things.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.440
What happened?
You were due yesterday.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.484
lnspections in Shanghai.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.820
One more strip-search
and my price goes way up.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.864
Mr. Thodey.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.242
Mr. Ling, it's gonna be fine, really.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.035
We now have enough liquid steel

04:05.119 --> 04:07.079
to start pumping it
under the excavation.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.705
But will it be enough

04:08.790 --> 04:10.916
to raise it safely
above the ground?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.628
Look, it's a sound plan,
and l'll do my best.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.089
That's all l can promise.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.466
Our gratitude, Mr. Thodey.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.806
l got that one.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.064
Aw, Tony.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.272
Mmm, chocolates and ladyfingers,

05:15.356 --> 05:16.732
my favorite.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.412
Thodey, l'm kind of

05:30.496 --> 05:32.622
in the middle
of something here.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.541
We got hit again.

05:34.625 --> 05:38.003
How are the ruins?
Any damage?

05:38.087 --> 05:39.838
The ruins? No.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.424
And l'm fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.176
Hey, l knew you'd be okay.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.844
You just don't get it, do you?

05:45.928 --> 05:48.180
These lunatics
mean business, Tony.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.515
Better finish dessert
without me, sweetie.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.225
l'm gonna have to take this.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.729
Okay, so what happened?

05:55.813 --> 05:57.981
We can't defend ourselves.
That's what happened.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.566
We've been over this, Thodey.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.902
Yeah, and l'm
guessing that's why

06:01.986 --> 06:04.321
you bumped the shipment
of weapons from the cargo.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.949
What are you talking about?
l didn't authorize any weapons.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.826
Tony.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.745
You went behind my back?

06:11.829 --> 06:13.497
What choice did l have?

06:13.581 --> 06:16.083
The closer we are to raising
the Mandarin's temple,

06:16.167 --> 06:17.209
the closer we are

06:17.293 --> 06:19.586
to getting our butts blown off
by those crazy zealots.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.671
The Jade Dragons aren't
trying to kill anybody,

06:21.756 --> 06:24.466
but if guns get thrown
into the mix, people will die.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.760
So you're telling me
you didn't KO the shipment?

06:26.844 --> 06:29.304
No. Would l have? Yes.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.848
Because l knew they'd
most likely be stolen.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.519
Look, one way or another,
l gotta get some support here.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.772
All right, Thodey.
l'll fly over.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.609
You said that last week
and the week before that.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.196
This time, l promise.
l'll clear my schedule.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.031
Just hang in there.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.076
Now it's time for something
that really needs my attention.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.849
Pepper, darling,
you look concerned. Am l late?

07:13.933 --> 07:16.726
40 minutes,
and they're not happy.

07:16.811 --> 07:20.063
So what else is new?
l say we keep it casual today.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.529
Smudged lipstick might
be a little too casual.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.963
Mr. Chairman, gentlemen.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.133
Okay, l take it we're not here

07:48.217 --> 07:49.801
to form a company soffball team.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.012
Cavalier as always, Mr. Chairman.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.805
This is just one more example of

07:53.890 --> 07:55.807
how little respect Tony Stark has

07:55.892 --> 07:57.809
for this company
and its shareholders.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.977
Ah, the shareholders.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.646
You know, l bet they'd
love a soffball team.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.315
That's right, Tony.
Laugh it off,

08:03.399 --> 08:04.983
just like you do
everything else.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.652
Let's see how funny
you think this is.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.946
We're correcting
a grave mistake today.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.656
Temind me,
which mistake is this?

08:11.741 --> 08:14.534
Handing you your own
Advanced Technologies division.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.579
lt was a colossal error in judgment
giving you that much freedom.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.414
Need l not remind this board

08:19.499 --> 08:20.957
l was against that decision

08:21.042 --> 08:22.250
from the very beginning?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.376
You need not.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.712
Then let me get to the point:

08:25.796 --> 08:27.756
you're being charged
with gross malfeasance.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.049
On what grounds?

08:29.133 --> 08:31.384
Let's try your little
excavation in China,

08:31.469 --> 08:34.596
with a price tag of 226 million
and climbing.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.933
You not only agreed to do
this without board approval,

08:38.017 --> 08:39.935
you're doing it all for free.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.728
You wanna know
about China?

08:41.812 --> 08:44.105
Call it a gesture of goodwill.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.107
But their government
is so grateful

08:46.192 --> 08:48.109
that they've just
awarded us contracts

08:48.194 --> 08:50.570
worth 20 times
what we're spending over there.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.113
Here. Look them over.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.741
l think you'll be
quite impressed.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.035
Now, is there anything else?

08:57.119 --> 09:00.163
How about the half a billion dollars
you've spent so far

09:00.248 --> 09:03.458
on some secret project,
again without board approval?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.085
Believe me when l say

09:05.169 --> 09:07.712
that what l've been working on
is the future of this company,

09:07.797 --> 09:11.049
a company that my innovations
have built into an empire,

09:11.133 --> 09:14.469
making every person at this table
indecently rich,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.973
despite the fact that this board
has done nothing but get in my way.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.350
lt is our job to control
loose cannons,

09:20.434 --> 09:23.061
just as it's our job
to cut them loose.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.479
What are you saying?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.815
Mr. Chairman,
l motion that Tony Stark

09:26.899 --> 09:28.483
be relieved of his duties

09:28.568 --> 09:30.902
and that his division
be shut down.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.237
You can't do that.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.405
l second.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.491
Dad, say something.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.079
All in favor, say "Aye."

09:41.163 --> 09:42.455
Aye.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.669
You want my father to drive
this company on his own?

09:47.753 --> 09:51.298
Because he will,
right into the ground!

09:56.095 --> 09:58.179
lt was the right decision, Howard.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.351
Telax and enjoy
the show, gentlemen.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.021
Today you get to witness
a 3,000-year-old city

10:06.105 --> 10:07.897
rise from the dead.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.108
Okay, let's do this.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.153
Commencing infusion
of liquid fiber steel.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.123
Lookin' good.

10:25.207 --> 10:28.126
Five seconds
to maximum dispersion.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.296
Three, two, one.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.715
All stuffed.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.383
lnitiate sonic bombardment.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.058
Gentlemen, what's happening here
is that sonic vibrations

10:43.142 --> 10:46.311
are causing the liquid steel
to expand,

10:46.395 --> 10:49.064
kind of like cotton candy
or steel wool.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.733
When we cease
the sonic bombardment,

10:51.817 --> 10:53.443
the steel will harden.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.321
See these foundation balloons?

10:56.405 --> 10:58.657
As they begin reaching
full capacity,

10:58.741 --> 11:01.660
they'll push up against
the base of the excavation

11:01.744 --> 11:04.746
and raise your ancient city
to ground level.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.132
Affer that, my friends,
it's there to stay.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.140
Move.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.268
Li Mei.

11:28.479 --> 11:32.065
l've told you l will
not take innocent lives.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.359
l decide what lives
are innocent,

11:34.443 --> 11:37.737
and anyone involved in
the raising of that city is not.

11:37.822 --> 11:41.658
Now you will take
as many lives as l command,

11:41.742 --> 11:43.952
or l will take yours.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.546
East and West
have joined in preserving

11:54.630 --> 11:56.715
an important part of our heritage.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.260
Heh. Too bad not everybody
agrees that's a good thing.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.262
You must understand

12:02.346 --> 12:04.139
the Mandarin's was the darkest,

12:04.223 --> 12:06.099
most violent of all dynasties.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.852
Hundreds of thousands died
under his brutal reign.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.146
But that's ancient history.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.314
Some fear that
by raising his temple,

12:13.399 --> 12:15.650
it is inviting history
to repeat itself.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.277
And what do you think?

12:17.361 --> 12:19.821
Many will pay tribute to this place,

12:19.905 --> 12:22.323
and prosperity will follow.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.702
To me, that is a good thing.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.626
Go! Tun!

12:50.436 --> 12:51.478
Aah!
Aah!

13:11.916 --> 13:14.375
Uhh!

13:20.257 --> 13:21.257
Ahh!

13:33.729 --> 13:37.023
Hmm. Pepper, you minx.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.484
You just couldn't stand it
any longer, could you?

13:39.568 --> 13:41.569
The ruins in China
were attacked again.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.948
Ah. Well, tell Thodey
l'm dealing with a crisis here.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.699
l'll fly out when l can.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.452
Tony, Thodey's missing.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.787
What?

13:50.871 --> 13:54.207
And the workers,
they're all dead.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.728
Uhh!

14:22.361 --> 14:23.820
What do you want from me?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.113
Not you,

14:25.197 --> 14:27.073
Tony Stark.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.962
Sir, we have
an obstruction ahead.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.552
l don't care.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.762
Just detour around it
and get me to the dig site.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.223
Yes, sir. Go right.
We're taking the side street.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.502
This isn't right.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.047
The streets here
are never empty.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.607
Look out!

15:47.279 --> 15:49.364
Back up. Back up.
Move! Move!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.495
Go! Go! Go!

16:44.670 --> 16:46.879
Tony!

16:46.964 --> 16:50.258
My God, what have you done?

16:50.342 --> 16:51.634
You butchers!

16:53.595 --> 16:54.846
Huhh!

17:04.314 --> 17:05.857
Will he live?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.068
For the moment,

17:09.153 --> 17:12.572
but his heart
has suffered great damage.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.033
Understand me, old man.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.202
lf he dies, you die.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.547
Aw, man.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.216
We gotta do something
to keep him alive.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.510
You are a man of medicine?

17:34.595 --> 17:37.805
An army medic,
but that was a long time ago.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.183
lt's just gonna have to do.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.397
You dare show concern
for that man?!

17:46.482 --> 17:47.815
- Ach.
- Uh!

17:47.900 --> 17:49.442
He may have doomed us all.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.153
Ohh!

18:01.830 --> 18:03.915
l will never understand

18:03.999 --> 18:07.251
why you do not show such courage
on the battlefield.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.630
There is much about me
you will never understand.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.385
l would advise you
not to lose sight

18:16.470 --> 18:19.388
of your responsibility, Li Mei.

18:19.473 --> 18:24.227
My responsibility is the only
thing that keeps me here.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.026
Master Chu, four elementals
have awakened.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.611
Where are they now?

20:38.695 --> 20:40.613
They have risen into the sky

20:40.697 --> 20:43.324
and set off upon their
quest for the rings.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.119
l hear someth--

20:47.204 --> 20:48.871
uhh--

20:57.214 --> 20:59.465
Howard, listen,
Tony's disappearance,

20:59.549 --> 21:01.300
as painful as it is,

21:01.385 --> 21:03.344
may be the best thing
for the company.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.680
You know, you lawyers
are all alike.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.682
That's my son
you're talking about.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.184
Even so,
you need to hear this.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.311
l've been contacted
by the Chinese government.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.688
They've got questions,

21:13.772 --> 21:17.024
like how our weapons ended up
in the hands of known radicals.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.026
They can't blame Tony for that.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.736
Let them blame
whoever they want,

21:20.821 --> 21:22.655
because if they
start looking at you,

21:22.739 --> 21:24.865
the board's gonna
throw you to the wolves.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.200
l don't believe that.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.535
lt's my company!

21:27.619 --> 21:30.705
lt's a public company,
and don't think for a second

21:30.789 --> 21:33.332
they won't do whatever's
necessary to protect it.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.609
Tony, easy, man.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.278
Just relax.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.904
Ho Yin.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.199
That's right.
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.701
Just breathe.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.661
What happened?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.538
You were attacked.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.290
lt got pretty bad, man.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.218
Wh-- Thodey.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.553
Sorry, Tony,

22:27.637 --> 22:30.973
but this hardware's
all that's keeping you alive.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.268
You saved my life.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.271
No, he did.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.902
Thank you.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.457
How is he?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.084
Ask him yourself.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.462
Tony, meet Li Mei,

23:01.546 --> 23:05.216
the only decent soul
in this den of cutthroats.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.385
Pardon me for not getting up.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.012
l am happy to see you are alive.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.764
That makes two of us.

23:19.940 --> 23:20.940
Thank you.

23:23.068 --> 23:27.571
Li Mei, can you tell me--
why are we prisoners?

23:27.656 --> 23:29.782
l must go.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.960
Huh. Well, heh heh.
That's a first.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.753
You scared off a woman.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.548
Easy to do when you
look like Frankenstein.

23:45.632 --> 23:49.301
How about we find a way
to streamline this a bit?

24:00.647 --> 24:04.233
Your weakness sickens me.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.986
lf only l possessed your strength.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.988
Then you would be my son

24:09.072 --> 24:11.198
instead of my disgrace.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.742
l am sorry, Father.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.036
Do not call me that.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.788
l am angry, Li Mei.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.167
l am angry that when
the Mandarin rises,

24:21.251 --> 24:24.753
it is you who will
face him, not me.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.506
lt was my right.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.926
l do not want this life.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.888
Your life means nothing.

24:33.972 --> 24:37.183
You are on this earth
to serve another purpose.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.018
lt is served with honor.

24:39.102 --> 24:42.563
When it's time, do not fail.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.804
Amateur video shot by tourists
revealing powerful entities

25:56.888 --> 25:58.764
tearing through Trafalgar Square...

25:58.848 --> 26:00.724
The elementals have the first ring.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.601
We are running out of time.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.104
But Tony Stark has
not yet recovered.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.231
Naah! He's well enough.

26:07.315 --> 26:09.233
We must begin now.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.657
Hey, Tony.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.451
Thodey, we have to figure out
what they plan to do with us.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.871
Whatever it is,
it ain't gonna be good.

26:22.956 --> 26:27.459
ln the end,
Wong Chu will kill you.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.211
No doubt.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.385
Why are the Jade Dragons
so up in arms?

26:36.469 --> 26:39.013
What you have
accomplished in months,

26:39.097 --> 26:42.349
they have spent 3,000 years

26:42.434 --> 26:44.226
trying to prevent.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.978
You mean raising the city?

26:46.062 --> 26:48.314
What could they
possibly be afraid of?

26:48.398 --> 26:49.898
The Mandarin.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.900
But he's nothing but dust now.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.361
Many do not see death

26:54.446 --> 26:57.323
as the final step in one's existence,

26:57.407 --> 27:00.826
and the prophecy
foretells his return.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.828
So because l liffed the ruins,

27:02.912 --> 27:04.955
people think the prophecy
is coming true?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.415
lt is as written:

27:06.499 --> 27:08.000
"The city will rise,

27:08.084 --> 27:11.003
and the demon elementals
will awaken.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.297
They will gather the bands
of the undereorld

27:13.381 --> 27:15.466
and with them
resurrect their master."

27:15.550 --> 27:16.800
That's just crazy.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.802
lf that is what you believe,

27:18.887 --> 27:21.305
there is no point in saying more.

27:21.389 --> 27:25.142
l'm sorry. lt's just hard
for me to swallow.

27:25.226 --> 27:28.354
Tell me, what are
these bands of the undereorld?

27:28.438 --> 27:30.522
Five were fashioned
for the Mandarin

27:30.607 --> 27:33.150
as conduits to the afferlife.

27:33.234 --> 27:36.862
Upon his death,
four were stolen by monks

27:36.946 --> 27:39.406
who sacrificed
their lives to hide them.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.451
They were the first Jade Dragons.

27:42.535 --> 27:45.663
These are the locations
of those bands.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.122
So once these things are found,

27:47.207 --> 27:49.291
the Mandarin is supposed
to come back to life?

27:49.376 --> 27:50.417
Yes.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.213
His demon elementals have
already begun to gather them.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.721
Stop the elementals

28:02.806 --> 28:05.516
and you prevent
the Mandarin from rising.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.684
Me? But l--

28:12.524 --> 28:14.775
Stand up!

28:19.572 --> 28:23.867
Do you want to live?

28:23.952 --> 28:26.412
lf l have a choice, yes.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.496
Then you will reverse

28:27.580 --> 28:29.707
what you have done
to the ancient city.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.959
Look, the fiber steel
that's holding it up

28:32.043 --> 28:33.711
is pretty much indestructible.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.546
You will find a way.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.257
We will provide you
with your own technology.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.342
What if l can't do it?

28:41.553 --> 28:44.555
You owe your life to this man.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.182
See how your unwillingness
repays him.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.899
Please, just stop.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.776
l'll help you.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.449
You have one week,
or he dies.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.462
What are we gonna do now?

29:16.546 --> 29:18.672
We get to work.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.276
Oh. Hi.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.991
Thank you.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.743
What will that device do?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.745
lt's a macrobiotic nullifier.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.498
lf it works, it'll soffen
the fiber steel under the ruins.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.625
Will you finish it in time?

30:36.709 --> 30:37.876
Hope so.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.212
l will let you get back to work.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.387
Li Mei.

30:52.433 --> 30:55.435
You don't belong
with these murderers.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.104
Why are you doing this?

30:57.188 --> 31:00.941
The Mandarin will rise,
and many will die

31:01.025 --> 31:02.818
in the East and in the West.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.862
Their souls will be
offered as payment for--

31:04.946 --> 31:07.614
Okay, that's the company line.
Now what about you?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.950
l have a responsibility.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.953
lt has been passed down
from father to son

31:13.037 --> 31:14.913
ever since the Mandarin Dynasty.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.707
Father to son. But--

31:16.791 --> 31:18.208
l had no brothers.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.377
And your father?

31:20.461 --> 31:22.504
He...

31:22.589 --> 31:23.630
is dead.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.465
l take it he wanted a son.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.301
No.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.386
He needed a son.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.305
lnstead he got me.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.848
You would not understand.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.433
Maybe l would.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.813
You're not the only one who's
faced a father's disappointment.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.733
Tony...

31:42.817 --> 31:45.819
do you know why you
are on this earth?

31:45.904 --> 31:46.862
Does anyone?

31:46.946 --> 31:49.489
Yes. l do.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.366
l have always known.

31:51.451 --> 31:54.036
So this is the life
you wanna live?

31:54.120 --> 31:57.831
My life does not matter.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.878
This thing's amazing.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.298
Where'd you get this idea?

32:48.383 --> 32:50.342
Just something l came up with.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.012
- Tony.
- What's going on?

32:54.097 --> 32:56.431
Wong Chu is coming.
You must escape.

32:56.516 --> 32:57.808
No!

33:00.645 --> 33:03.313
Get back.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.691
Demonstrate your device now.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.234
Hey, no problem.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.360
Allow me.

33:08.444 --> 33:11.571
Okay, sample is in place.

33:11.656 --> 33:16.493
Let's see. Activating
thermal scan constrictors.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.037
Setting atomic, uh,

33:19.122 --> 33:21.748
nine iron to 350 and, uh...

33:21.833 --> 33:24.751
adjusting
the permanent press settings.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.504
And, um...

33:27.588 --> 33:30.424
hmm.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.675
Ahh.

33:36.222 --> 33:39.349
Your deception will
cost you your life.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.153
Aah.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.370
This way!

34:05.168 --> 34:07.210
Master Chu.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.964
Whoa.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.111
Yaah!

34:49.462 --> 34:51.129
Whaah!

34:57.887 --> 35:00.722
Li Mei, it's okay.
lt's me, Tony.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.474
Go. Leave.

35:02.558 --> 35:04.726
Not without you.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.229
Just get out of here

35:07.313 --> 35:10.565
and promise me
you'll never come back.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.567
l won't leave you here.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.236
Goodbye, Tony.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.822
Come on, man.
We gotta go.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.537
Climb on.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.969
Phew. Stuffy.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.763
That's the last time l ever
wanna put this thing on.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.733
What should we do with him?

36:35.985 --> 36:37.402
Why are you asking me?

36:37.486 --> 36:39.571
You are now
the senior member.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.698
l do not care.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.170
He is the one.

36:55.254 --> 36:57.380
No, it is not him.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.387
Li Mei, look at it.
lt is undeniable.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.599
The prophecy
continues to unfold.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.976
He is the lron Knight.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.063
He is destined to battle
the risen Mandarin.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.732
lt cannot be him!

37:15.816 --> 37:19.319
What is the matter?
lt is a good thing.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.447
The Mandarin
can now be defeated.

37:22.531 --> 37:25.325
We do not know
who will be victorious,

37:25.409 --> 37:27.452
only that one will die.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.753
Stark Air 6-0-1,
you are cleared for landing.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.380
Proceed to runway three.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.441
Hands in the air.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.661
What's going on here?

38:09.745 --> 38:10.912
SHlELD Agent Drake.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.664
l'm placing you under arrest.

38:12.748 --> 38:13.832
For what?

38:13.916 --> 38:15.875
Arms dealing.
The Chinese government

38:15.960 --> 38:17.877
is charging you
with selling weapons

38:17.962 --> 38:19.879
to known radicals,
the Jade Dragons.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.007
You guys got this all wrong.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.049
Listen to me.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.093
The Jade Dragons
only have Stark weaponry

38:25.177 --> 38:27.387
because they stole it
from our cargo jet.

38:27.471 --> 38:30.056
We've received documents
linking you to the sale.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.225
What documents?
There was no sale.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.442
Uhh!

39:04.175 --> 39:06.092
Cease fire! Cease fire!

39:06.177 --> 39:09.471
He knows it's bulletproof,
because he built it for us.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.275
What are you doing?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.818
We must hurry.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.029
What of the fiffh elemental?

39:27.948 --> 39:30.950
lf we destroy the temple,
the Dragon will fall.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.123
Fine. l will go in first.

39:46.258 --> 39:48.176
lt is safe.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.303
Now move, quickly.

40:07.696 --> 40:10.240
Okay, that is far enough.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.491
Set up here.

40:40.646 --> 40:41.646
Ahh!
Ahh!

41:39.330 --> 41:41.289
Forgive me.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.520
Why is this happening to us?

42:03.604 --> 42:06.314
l don't know, but we're
cut off from our offices.

42:06.398 --> 42:08.149
Man!

42:09.276 --> 42:12.237
Hey...

42:13.280 --> 42:14.948
those locations are...

42:17.618 --> 42:20.995
Ho Yin drew them on this map.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.375
You think the old man was right?

42:25.459 --> 42:28.044
Something's going on,
and l want some answers.

42:28.128 --> 42:29.879
Where are you going?

42:29.964 --> 42:31.714
Affer the third ring.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.188
l beg your pardon?

42:47.273 --> 42:48.314
Hello.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.567
Oh, hi, Mom.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.986
- Mom?
- Yes, l'm fine.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.862
Busy busy busy.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.491
Lots of company.

42:59.827 --> 43:02.579
What have you
gotten yourself into?

43:02.663 --> 43:04.038
l'll explain later, Pep.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.790
Tight now l need into my office.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.750
That's going to be a bit difficult

43:07.835 --> 43:10.003
since l have SHlELD agents
crawling up my--

43:10.087 --> 43:12.505
Pepper, l know.
Can you arrange it?

43:12.590 --> 43:15.633
You know the east staireell door
that leads to the outside?

43:15.718 --> 43:18.386
l'll make sure it's unlocked.

43:34.403 --> 43:35.820
Hello.

43:35.904 --> 43:38.531
Tony, l-l can
hardly hear you.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.618
Well, how did you two
sneak into the lobby?

43:42.661 --> 43:46.122
You have to get out of there
before the agents-- Tony? Tony?

43:46.206 --> 43:47.332
Oh, darn.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.167
Suspects are in the lobby.

43:49.251 --> 43:52.128
l repeat: suspects are in the lobby.

43:54.131 --> 43:57.425
Temind me to move my office
to the first floor.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.348
So l want assets from these
three offshore accounts

44:03.432 --> 44:05.767
made available,
and keep it on the downlow.

44:05.851 --> 44:09.395
What? We came here
so you can do business?

44:10.898 --> 44:12.315
Not exactly.

44:12.399 --> 44:13.983
Access code: Maria.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.652
Access granted.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.326
What the?

44:25.204 --> 44:28.039
Greetings, Mr. Stark.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.208
Since when do you have
a secret room?

44:30.292 --> 44:31.292
Come on, Thodey.

44:32.544 --> 44:34.629
Pepper, l owe you one.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.643
And l'm keeping track.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.732
Lights.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.320
Whoa.

45:04.868 --> 45:07.704
lnteractive exosuits.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.956
With these things,
one person can accomplish

45:10.040 --> 45:12.041
what it normally
would take dozens,

45:12.126 --> 45:14.585
exploration of any hostile
environments, deep sea,

45:14.670 --> 45:17.171
volcano, space-- anything.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.716
These armors
will change the world.

45:20.759 --> 45:22.635
And since the next place on the map

45:22.720 --> 45:24.345
is on the floor of the Atlantic,

45:24.430 --> 45:27.432
the aquatic model
is going to get me there.

45:30.519 --> 45:31.853
Something wrong?

45:31.937 --> 45:34.147
Just something
you came up with, huh?

45:34.231 --> 45:38.151
l know. Sorry, but l just
wanted to keep it top secret.

45:38.235 --> 45:40.611
Top secret?

45:40.696 --> 45:42.613
Aw, you're full of it, Tony.

45:42.698 --> 45:43.948
Thodey.

45:45.075 --> 45:47.702
This is what you
hired me for, isn't it,

45:47.786 --> 45:49.495
to work with you
in development?

45:49.580 --> 45:51.831
l was going to bring you in
when the time was right.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.000
When the time was--

45:54.084 --> 45:57.170
why don't you just
own up to it, Tony?

45:57.254 --> 45:59.881
You didn't trust me enough
to be a part of this project.

45:59.965 --> 46:00.923
Thodey--

46:01.008 --> 46:02.759
l mean, l'm your closest friend.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.510
l've always been in your corner.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.721
Come on, Thodey.
You're making this personal.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.681
We're friends.
Why are you overreacting?

46:08.766 --> 46:12.101
l'm the only one who sees it
for what it is.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.395
Temember when your father
took your stuff

46:14.480 --> 46:16.230
and put it into
his weapons program,

46:16.315 --> 46:18.816
how betrayed you felt?
Well, guess what, Tony.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.735
You're just like him.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.328
You know what?
You're right.

46:30.412 --> 46:32.914
We've got a lot to talk about,

46:32.998 --> 46:35.041
but right now l need your help.

48:20.814 --> 48:23.482
This must be the place.

48:52.512 --> 48:54.347
Spectrum analysis.

48:54.431 --> 48:57.099
Unknown energy source detected.

49:02.230 --> 49:03.814
Aah! Uhh.

49:19.289 --> 49:21.332
Whaah!

49:31.385 --> 49:33.427
Ow.

49:57.786 --> 49:59.412
Sweet dreams.

50:06.753 --> 50:24.603
Aah!

50:38.618 --> 50:43.164
Warning. Warning:
suit integrity compromised.

50:43.248 --> 50:45.499
Warning: armor breach.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.752
Life support failing.

51:17.616 --> 51:19.867
Looks like
it didn't go so well.

51:19.951 --> 51:22.119
lt's real, Thodey, all of it.

51:22.204 --> 51:27.041
What l fought today, l can't even
begin to explain, but it is real.

51:27.125 --> 51:28.709
What have l done?

51:28.794 --> 51:30.127
lt's not your fault.

51:30.212 --> 51:31.754
Telease armor.

51:40.472 --> 51:42.556
Thodey, l raised
that ancient city.

51:42.641 --> 51:45.893
l set this in motion.
lt is my fault.

51:45.977 --> 51:47.228
And true to form,

51:47.312 --> 51:49.563
my father has made
everything worse.

51:49.648 --> 51:52.733
You're not gonna do
something stupid, are you?

51:52.818 --> 51:54.276
Absolutely.

51:58.824 --> 52:01.242
You sold me out!

52:01.326 --> 52:02.660
l did no such thing.

52:02.744 --> 52:04.620
You needed a fall guy
for the Chinese government,

52:04.704 --> 52:06.580
so you trumped up
a phony arms deal.

52:06.665 --> 52:09.083
Underhanded ethics are
your domain, not mine.

52:09.167 --> 52:10.709
Don't talk to me about ethics.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.962
You loaded weapons
onto the cargo jet for Thodey

52:13.046 --> 52:15.548
knowing l was against it.
They got stolen and people died.

52:15.632 --> 52:17.466
Now they're blaming me
for those deaths.

52:17.551 --> 52:20.636
Thodey needed protection.
You leff him out there with nothing.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.805
They attacked us
with our guns, Dad.

52:22.889 --> 52:24.890
l wouldn't be on the run
if you'd just stayed out of it.

52:24.975 --> 52:27.226
Why don't you drop
this pacifist bull?

52:27.310 --> 52:29.562
Military contracts are
what built this company.

52:29.646 --> 52:31.355
No, it started the company.

52:31.439 --> 52:33.732
l built it
and without a single weapon.

52:33.817 --> 52:36.443
Listen to you.
You sound just like--

52:36.528 --> 52:38.487
Go on!

52:38.572 --> 52:39.738
Like my mother?

52:39.823 --> 52:41.282
She hated the work l did,

52:41.366 --> 52:43.325
and she got you believing
that weapons were--

52:43.410 --> 52:45.077
How dare you blame her
for any of this?

52:45.162 --> 52:47.746
She stood by you, Dad.
She defended you.

52:47.831 --> 52:50.708
When are you going to stop
blaming me for her death?

52:50.792 --> 52:52.334
l lost her too.

52:52.419 --> 52:54.795
Yeah, but l lost you both.

53:10.437 --> 53:11.437
Pepper.

53:11.521 --> 53:12.479
Hi, Tony.

53:12.564 --> 53:13.564
Tony?

53:20.864 --> 53:22.072
Ohh!

53:22.157 --> 53:24.617
Oops. Clumsy me.

53:24.701 --> 53:28.787
You're aiding and abetting
a fugitive, Ms. Potts.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.296
l don't know how
you're helping him,

53:37.380 --> 53:38.422
but you are,

53:38.506 --> 53:40.549
and that's enough
to take you into custody.

53:40.634 --> 53:44.220
Fine. l could use the rest.

53:53.146 --> 53:56.357
l've pulled data
on the fourth ring's location.

53:56.441 --> 53:59.485
lt looks like it's right
in the center of an active volcano.

53:59.569 --> 54:00.819
We've got bigger problems.

54:00.904 --> 54:02.863
They're onto us,
and Pepper's been arrested.

54:02.948 --> 54:05.658
Slipping past them is definitely
gonna be a problem.

54:05.742 --> 54:07.534
Then l'll lure them away.

54:07.619 --> 54:09.954
What? No, Thodey,
they'll arrest you.

54:10.038 --> 54:11.872
Look, l'm open
to other options,

54:11.957 --> 54:14.124
but face it--
we're trapped in here,

54:14.209 --> 54:16.335
and you've gotta get
to Central America.

54:16.419 --> 54:19.797
Thodey, thanks.

54:19.881 --> 54:22.341
Hey, it's what friends do.

54:33.186 --> 54:34.770
Hey, Jake and Elwood.

54:36.189 --> 54:38.023
We got him on the roof!

55:39.252 --> 55:40.711
l'll take that.

56:41.314 --> 56:44.858
Okay, fellas, take it easy.

56:44.943 --> 56:45.943
Ahh!

57:12.387 --> 57:13.387
Uhh!

58:03.605 --> 58:05.147
Huhh!

58:05.231 --> 58:07.107
Just...

58:07.192 --> 58:09.610
stay down!

58:25.710 --> 58:27.085
Aah!

58:29.506 --> 58:31.089
Uhh.

58:55.323 --> 58:57.449
Lose something, rock slide?

1:00:03.099 --> 1:00:05.809
Tony.

1:00:05.893 --> 1:00:07.311
Li Mei.

1:00:10.231 --> 1:00:12.232
What are you doing here?

1:00:12.317 --> 1:00:13.775
l did not know where else to go.

1:00:13.860 --> 1:00:15.152
l tried your building, but--

1:00:15.236 --> 1:00:16.361
Yeah, it's complicated.

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:18.697
Li Mei, listen, l went affer
the Mandarin's rings.

1:00:18.781 --> 1:00:20.782
l know.
Why would you do that?

1:00:20.867 --> 1:00:22.200
l had to.

1:00:22.285 --> 1:00:24.536
- Did you get them?
- Just one.

1:00:24.621 --> 1:00:26.705
And what of the elementals?

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:28.624
Only the Earth Mover is leff.

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:30.208
Then you are not safe.

1:00:30.293 --> 1:00:32.961
He will seek out
that ring wherever it is.

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:35.505
Please, give it to me.

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:37.466
lt is my responsibility.

1:00:37.550 --> 1:00:40.552
There's no way l'm letting
that thing come affer you.

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:42.387
Tony, it is not your burden.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:43.972
There must be another way.

1:00:44.057 --> 1:00:46.683
No. There is not.

1:00:46.768 --> 1:00:48.852
What about the tomb?
What if l destroy it?

1:00:48.936 --> 1:00:51.104
Will it end?
Li Mei, tell me.

1:00:51.189 --> 1:00:53.732
l don't know.

1:00:53.816 --> 1:00:56.151
Then it's worth a try.

1:00:56.235 --> 1:00:58.028
But l'm gonna need
some armor.

1:01:02.617 --> 1:01:03.659
Hello.

1:01:03.743 --> 1:01:05.410
ls this line secure?

1:01:05.495 --> 1:01:06.536
Tony.

1:01:06.621 --> 1:01:09.206
Son, yes, of course it is.

1:01:09.290 --> 1:01:11.917
Are you okay?
l've been so worried.

1:01:12.001 --> 1:01:15.045
Dad, what's going on?

1:01:15.129 --> 1:01:18.548
Nothing. Everything's fine, really.
Tell me, what do you need?

1:01:18.633 --> 1:01:20.384
They've got Pepper and Thodey.

1:01:20.468 --> 1:01:22.052
Can you get me
into the building?

1:01:22.136 --> 1:01:24.179
Absolutely, Tony.
l'll clear the way.

1:01:24.263 --> 1:01:26.640
Just come on up, okay?
l'll take care of everything.

1:01:26.724 --> 1:01:29.309
l love you, son.

1:01:33.815 --> 1:01:35.482
They were listening.

1:01:35.566 --> 1:01:37.901
He was warning me away.

1:01:37.985 --> 1:01:41.071
l don't know what else to do.

1:01:41.155 --> 1:01:43.281
Unless...

1:01:43.366 --> 1:01:44.366
come on.

1:01:50.123 --> 1:01:51.790
Uhh!

1:01:53.167 --> 1:01:54.710
Huhh!

1:03:48.991 --> 1:03:50.492
Uhh!

1:03:59.043 --> 1:04:01.837
l have had enough of you!

1:04:45.089 --> 1:04:50.635
Uhh!

1:05:22.835 --> 1:05:24.711
Here. Take these.

1:05:24.795 --> 1:05:26.755
l'm going affer the temple.

1:05:26.839 --> 1:05:29.758
Maybe the fiffh ring is
still in the tomb with him.

1:05:29.842 --> 1:05:31.301
lt isn't.

1:05:33.429 --> 1:05:35.305
lt's here.

1:05:39.518 --> 1:05:40.769
Your bracelet.

1:05:40.853 --> 1:05:42.854
You must go. Please.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:45.607
Li Mei, what is going on?

1:05:45.691 --> 1:05:48.026
l begged you not to come.

1:05:48.110 --> 1:05:50.987
l've done everything
l could to keep you away.

1:05:51.072 --> 1:05:52.030
What?

1:05:52.114 --> 1:05:54.866
l gave the government
those documents so they'd arrest you.

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:57.494
- Why?
- To save your life.

1:05:57.578 --> 1:06:00.372
l told you, l have
a responsibility.

1:06:00.456 --> 1:06:02.332
l know, to stop the Mandarin.

1:06:02.416 --> 1:06:04.960
Not to stop him,

1:06:05.044 --> 1:06:07.754
to ensure his resurrection.

1:06:08.923 --> 1:06:11.383
What are you saying?

1:06:11.467 --> 1:06:14.511
You mean
joining the Jade Dragons,

1:06:14.595 --> 1:06:16.513
the things you said to me--

1:06:16.597 --> 1:06:18.974
l am the last descendent
of the Mandarin.

1:06:19.058 --> 1:06:20.225
lt falls to me.

1:06:20.309 --> 1:06:24.020
l must be his vessel
so he may walk the earth again.

1:06:24.105 --> 1:06:26.064
Li Mei, listen.

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:28.066
You don't have to do this.

1:06:28.150 --> 1:06:32.070
This-- it's the only
reason l even exist,

1:06:32.154 --> 1:06:35.198
the very purpose of my life.

1:06:35.282 --> 1:06:39.786
Please, go while you still can.

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:44.791
l'm not going anywhere.

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:49.671
Then you will die.

1:06:59.598 --> 1:07:00.640
Li Mei!

1:07:26.709 --> 1:08:09.542
Uhh!

1:09:19.196 --> 1:09:20.196
Aah!

1:10:32.603 --> 1:10:34.103
Uhh!

1:10:34.188 --> 1:10:35.813
Aah!

1:10:55.542 --> 1:10:57.126
Ahh!

1:11:33.455 --> 1:12:00.815
Uhh!

1:13:00.667 --> 1:13:02.335
Whaah!

1:13:58.517 --> 1:14:00.768
Li Mei, where are you?!

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:19.120
Li Mei.

1:14:19.204 --> 1:14:21.330
Are you all right?
What happened?

1:14:24.543 --> 1:14:26.335
Don't touch me.

1:14:37.347 --> 1:14:40.224
She has served
her purpose, lron Knight.

1:14:40.309 --> 1:14:45.229
As for you, your blood
must now be shed

1:14:45.314 --> 1:14:48.483
and the prophecy will be fulfilled.

1:15:10.797 --> 1:15:13.299
Li Mei, l know you're in there.

1:15:15.677 --> 1:15:18.679
Please, don't do this.

1:15:18.764 --> 1:15:20.223
Huhh!

1:15:53.757 --> 1:15:55.174
Listen to me!

1:15:55.259 --> 1:15:58.844
Temember who you are!

1:15:58.929 --> 1:16:12.149
You are Li Mei!

1:16:12.234 --> 1:16:14.569
Kill him.

1:16:18.407 --> 1:16:20.366
Kill him!

1:16:29.668 --> 1:16:32.712
Get away from him!

1:16:36.008 --> 1:17:09.290
Aah!

1:17:43.617 --> 1:17:45.326
Li Mei.

1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:49.372
Tony.

1:17:49.456 --> 1:17:51.165
l'm right here.

1:17:51.249 --> 1:17:53.250
You...

1:17:53.335 --> 1:17:56.003
saved me.

1:17:56.088 --> 1:17:57.380
You saved me too.

1:18:45.971 --> 1:18:46.929
Ohh.
Hmm?

1:18:47.013 --> 1:18:49.223
Hmm?
Tony.

1:18:49.307 --> 1:18:52.601
Tony, thank you
for coming in.

1:18:52.686 --> 1:18:54.270
l apologize for being late.

1:18:54.354 --> 1:18:57.273
l had to finish my last
interview with SHlELD.

1:18:57.357 --> 1:19:00.234
We're happy to hear
the Chinese government

1:19:00.318 --> 1:19:02.111
cleared you of all charges.

1:19:02.195 --> 1:19:05.281
Uh, Tony, let me
get right to the point.

1:19:05.365 --> 1:19:08.242
We've just learned
that over the last week,

1:19:08.326 --> 1:19:11.078
someone has been
buying up stock, so much stock

1:19:11.163 --> 1:19:13.581
that this board no longer
has controlling interest.

1:19:13.665 --> 1:19:16.208
And you suspect that
l'm that someone?

1:19:16.293 --> 1:19:18.544
Well, yes.

1:19:18.628 --> 1:19:20.713
You're correct.

1:19:20.797 --> 1:19:23.424
Stark Enterprises is mine.

1:19:26.344 --> 1:19:29.597
Um, l would just like
to remind you, Mr. Stark,

1:19:29.681 --> 1:19:33.934
that as a board of directors,
we have always always

1:19:34.019 --> 1:19:36.353
had the company's
best interests at heart.

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:38.147
Now sometimes
we may have acted--

1:19:38.231 --> 1:19:39.815
l have two orders of business.

1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:45.571
One, l'm promoting
James Thodes

1:19:45.655 --> 1:19:48.491
to Chief Engineer for
Advanced Technologies.

1:19:50.869 --> 1:19:51.994
Thanks, man.

1:19:52.078 --> 1:19:53.412
You've earned it.

1:19:53.497 --> 1:19:56.081
And two, l'm handing
control of the company

1:19:56.166 --> 1:19:58.167
over to my father.

1:19:59.544 --> 1:20:01.086
What?

1:20:01.171 --> 1:20:03.088
lt's yours, Dad.

1:20:03.173 --> 1:20:04.882
The future of the company

1:20:04.966 --> 1:20:07.176
is now yours to decide.

1:20:09.346 --> 1:20:14.016
You know, l've always seen this
as a father-son enterprise.

1:20:18.730 --> 1:20:21.440
Wonderful news, Tony, Howard.

1:20:21.525 --> 1:20:24.735
We'll support you both 110%.

1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:26.570
Shut up, Boyer.

1:20:26.655 --> 1:20:28.656
My first order of business...

1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:31.033
you're all fired.
