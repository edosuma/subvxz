00:07.974 --> 00:09.603
KAROLINA:
Previously on Marvel's Runaways.

00:09.686 --> 00:11.899
Get out!
[voice roars]

00:11.982 --> 00:13.861
I sever my ties with thee.

00:13.945 --> 00:15.615
-LESLIE: What are you suggesting?
-We build our own weapons.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.243
JANET:
Turn on our kids?

00:17.326 --> 00:18.996
Hi. I'm Xavin.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.082
I've been looking for you.

00:20.165 --> 00:23.506
Karolina, we need you over here.
It's v-important.

00:23.589 --> 00:25.175
You still got that piece I gave you?

00:25.259 --> 00:26.261
Hold it right.

00:26.344 --> 00:27.973
You don't know
what's been done with it, but I do.

00:28.056 --> 00:29.016
And it's on you now.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.520
[telephone rings]

00:30.603 --> 00:31.437
VICTOR: Son.

00:31.522 --> 00:33.818
-Wait, Dad, is that you?
-I'm sick.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.572
-ALEX: What's going on?
-CHASE: I'm going home.

00:35.655 --> 00:37.867
LESLIE: A re-conditioning.
I invented re-conditioning.

00:37.951 --> 00:40.080
If you don't sit down, we're going
to have to take this to the next level.

00:40.163 --> 00:41.040
Go to hell, Frank.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.629
LESLIE: [distant]
Vaughn! Help me, please!

00:43.713 --> 00:45.173
SUSAN: Welcome home.

00:45.257 --> 00:46.467
I'm S4E2R.

00:46.552 --> 00:48.388
LESLIE: This is my church.
You know that, right?

00:50.643 --> 00:51.562
Susan.

00:51.645 --> 00:54.985
You weren't supposed to say

00:55.068 --> 00:56.697
my name!

00:59.410 --> 01:01.331
DAVID: My light
will shine through another...

01:02.667 --> 01:05.339
and cast out the darkness
covering the earth.

01:05.422 --> 01:06.925
[voice echoes]

01:07.009 --> 01:08.053
Don't you see?

01:09.138 --> 01:11.184
YOUNG LESLIE:
Mom, where are we going?

01:11.267 --> 01:13.355
DAVID:
It's in the scripture.

01:13.939 --> 01:15.652
She's been chosen.

01:15.735 --> 01:17.446
LESLIE'S MOTHER:
She's just a child.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.325
DAVID:
He'll wait till she's of age.

01:19.868 --> 01:22.666
LESLIE'S MOTHER: You can't stop us
from leaving, David.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.464
DAVID:
You don't understand, do you?

01:27.466 --> 01:28.594
Leslie's not going anywhere.

01:30.556 --> 01:31.767
You are.

01:37.236 --> 01:39.658
[infant laughing]

01:48.091 --> 01:52.224
[infant cooing]

01:53.476 --> 01:55.439
LESLIE'S MOTHER:
She's just a child.

01:58.738 --> 01:59.948
YOUNG LESLIE:
Mom?

02:10.970 --> 02:13.391
[infant laughing]

02:20.948 --> 02:23.369
[infant crying]

02:30.551 --> 02:32.555
[gasps]

02:34.768 --> 02:36.772
[groans]

02:44.704 --> 02:46.875
[sharp gasp]

02:49.965 --> 02:52.971
[computer trills]

02:59.776 --> 03:01.279
House meeting, five minutes.

03:10.005 --> 03:11.257
I'm concerned about Chase.

03:13.052 --> 03:15.056
He made his choice.
We all have to move on.

03:18.021 --> 03:19.816
Just like that?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.530
We're not Cylons
from Alex's Doctor Who show.

03:22.614 --> 03:24.241
I appreciate the effort, but...

03:24.325 --> 03:26.329
I-I'm just saying, I mean,
what if he knows he screwed up,

03:26.412 --> 03:27.832
but now he's trapped?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.418
Well, then, he'd reach out.

03:29.502 --> 03:32.090
But I'm assuming he won't
'cause I'm guessing he likes

03:32.174 --> 03:34.386
not having to dodge rats
on the way to the kitchen.

03:34.470 --> 03:38.311
It's actually only one rat, and,
ironically, I named him Chase.

03:38.394 --> 03:43.697
Look, Chase was the first to go,
but probably won't be the last.

03:45.283 --> 03:46.662
He didn't just leave.

03:47.496 --> 03:48.958
He went home.

03:49.041 --> 03:52.130
How can we be sure he doesn't
tell his parents where the hostel is?

03:52.214 --> 03:54.218
No. He may be asinine...

03:55.220 --> 03:57.474
dimwitted, fatuous, witless...

03:57.558 --> 03:59.562
ALEX: We get that you're angry.
What's your point?

03:59.646 --> 04:01.817
He's an idiot. He's not a traitor.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.948
Assuming he has a choice. They used
the truth drug on him the last time.

04:05.031 --> 04:06.450
Who knows what they'll do next.

04:06.535 --> 04:07.578
KAROLINA:
My mom's in trouble.

04:08.872 --> 04:11.335
Vaughn just called and said
Frank sent her to the Crater.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.047
It's a Gibb compound in the desert

04:13.131 --> 04:15.761
where they do religious trials
and discipline.

04:15.845 --> 04:18.266
NICO: Which sounds
like brainwashing torture.

04:18.349 --> 04:20.478
Which is exactly why
we need to go rescue her.

04:20.563 --> 04:21.565
ALEX: Whoa, what?

04:21.648 --> 04:22.650
No way.

04:22.734 --> 04:24.654
We're trying to put our parents
in jail, not break them out.

04:24.738 --> 04:26.490
-This is different.
-GERT: May be better.

04:26.575 --> 04:28.787
Given the current state
of the federal penitentiary system,

04:28.871 --> 04:30.958
religious prison might actually
be more humane.

04:31.042 --> 04:33.672
It's like justice with meditation
and yoga sessions.

04:33.756 --> 04:34.966
KAROLINA:
No, it's not like that.

04:35.050 --> 04:36.052
Vaughn sounded really scared.

04:36.135 --> 04:38.139
He said some people that go
to the crater don't come back.

04:38.222 --> 04:41.145
Well, that sounds like the logical result
of joining an alien-worshiping cult.

04:41.228 --> 04:43.066
-Hey.
-KAROLINA: I lost my dad.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.652
I can't lose my mom too.

04:44.736 --> 04:47.992
ALEX: We lost all of our parents the day
we found out they were serial killers.

04:48.076 --> 04:50.706
Actually, we saved your dad
when he was in trouble.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.794
KAROLINA:
And if we rescue my mom,

04:52.877 --> 04:54.379
maybe we could get some
information out of her.

04:54.463 --> 04:56.258
You mean like turn her?

04:56.342 --> 04:58.096
MOLLY: They get one of ours,
we get one of theirs.

04:58.179 --> 04:59.516
I like it.

05:04.901 --> 05:07.197
I'm-I'm not gonna decide for everyone.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.451
Either we all go, or none of us do.

05:10.286 --> 05:12.499
Great. None of us do.

05:14.712 --> 05:17.217
MARY: You have no idea
why they want us to come here?

05:17.300 --> 05:19.764
I mean, no one gets invited here.

05:19.848 --> 05:21.977
Closest anyone from work
has ever been to the Stein house

05:22.060 --> 05:24.064
is a layout in Architectural Digest.

05:24.148 --> 05:27.112
MEGAN: I mean,
we're getting promotions, obvi.

05:27.195 --> 05:29.241
PRIDE loves us.

05:29.324 --> 05:31.245
You know, they probably
didn't want to do it around the others

05:31.328 --> 05:32.915
'cause jealousy.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.213
MARY:
That makes a lot of sense.

05:36.297 --> 05:39.303
[sighs] Wait.
Am I dressed appropriately?

05:39.386 --> 05:41.348
What's appropriate promotion attire?

05:41.432 --> 05:42.977
Exactly what you're wearing.

05:43.060 --> 05:45.106
You too.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.653
Oh, my God, Megan,
it's all happening.

05:47.737 --> 05:49.448
It's the beginning of everything, Mary.

05:49.532 --> 05:50.743
[gun cocks]

05:52.747 --> 05:54.792
[both shrieking]

05:54.876 --> 05:56.086
My God!

05:56.170 --> 05:57.590
What's crappening?

05:57.673 --> 05:59.677
Oh, my God, what's song with bee?

05:59.761 --> 06:00.930
[dart thuds]

06:01.013 --> 06:02.015
[Megan sighs]

06:03.560 --> 06:05.814
You're messing
with the pong weeples!

06:05.898 --> 06:07.400
This house--

06:12.160 --> 06:13.580
Belongs to me.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.220
The neurodisruptor's intensity
was off.

06:21.303 --> 06:23.684
She was still cognizant.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.896
Is this really necessary?

06:25.980 --> 06:28.944
These weapons were designed
specifically for our kids' powers.

06:29.027 --> 06:32.158
It's better to make sure no one's head
explodes when they're used on people.

06:32.242 --> 06:34.831
OK, let's mind-wipe 'em, do it again.

06:34.914 --> 06:36.668
[Robert sighs]

06:48.399 --> 06:50.946
Wait, why'd they ask us
to come here again?

06:51.030 --> 06:52.533
I don't know.

06:52.616 --> 06:53.827
Promotions?

06:53.910 --> 06:55.789
Oh, yeah. Yeah, probably.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.503
Yeah, PRIDE loves us, right?

06:58.587 --> 07:01.300
Yeah, they probably didn't want
to do it around the others.

07:01.383 --> 07:03.220
Huh. That makes sense.

07:04.599 --> 07:06.393
[gun cocks]

07:07.980 --> 07:09.609
[both shriek]

07:10.544 --> 07:13.211
[theme music playing]

08:30.687 --> 08:32.525
Pancakes or waffles?
I made both.

08:32.607 --> 08:34.318
CHASE:
Uh, maybe just the shake.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.534
And some pancakes.

08:40.331 --> 08:41.583
I made 'em just the way you like.

08:41.668 --> 08:45.299
[Chase chuckles]
Yeah, when I was... eight.

08:46.343 --> 08:48.055
This is a big adjustment for everyone.

08:49.057 --> 08:51.353
But... you did the right thing.

08:52.355 --> 08:54.067
-Coming home.
-Did I?

08:55.152 --> 08:56.488
I mean, yeah, I know I did.

08:56.573 --> 08:58.200
This is where
I need to be right now.

08:58.284 --> 09:01.874
I just... I don't know, I kind of
feel like I abandoned my friends.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.337
Yeah, but that life
was never gonna last.

09:05.339 --> 09:07.135
And if you tell us where they are,

09:07.218 --> 09:09.055
we can make sure
they get home safely too.

09:09.139 --> 09:12.896
Mom, I may not be a runaway anymore,
but I'm not gonna betray my friends.

09:15.276 --> 09:16.278
Where's Dad?

09:16.361 --> 09:18.533
Was he working late last night?
I thought I heard him coming home.

09:18.617 --> 09:21.914
VICTOR: That was just some PRIDE
employees picking up a few things.

09:21.998 --> 09:23.835
Hey, speaking of which,

09:23.918 --> 09:25.922
we're still smoothing things over
with Atlas Academy.

09:26.006 --> 09:28.010
It'll be a few days
until you're re-enrolled,

09:28.093 --> 09:31.308
so, in the meantime,
we were thinking

09:31.391 --> 09:34.230
maybe you could learn a bit
about our philanthropic work.

09:34.314 --> 09:36.318
Hard pass. I don't want
anything to do with PRIDE.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.988
It's a new day for everyone, Chase.

09:38.782 --> 09:40.619
And with Jonah gone,
PRIDE can finally be

09:40.702 --> 09:42.539
the benevolent force
that it was always meant to be.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.042
Yeah, just try it out
for a couple of days.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.171
It'll give us some father-son
bonding time out of the house.

09:47.173 --> 09:48.425
That could be OK, I guess.

09:48.510 --> 09:50.012
Then it's settled. Fantastic.

09:50.096 --> 09:51.516
Hey, I bet you miss the view.

09:51.599 --> 09:53.895
You want to head outside,
catch up with your old man?

09:53.978 --> 09:56.191
Uh... sure.

09:56.274 --> 09:57.695
Take--

09:57.778 --> 09:59.824
VICTOR: We can toss
the old pigskin around.

09:59.907 --> 10:01.493
I play lacrosse.

10:01.577 --> 10:03.998
When have we ever thrown a football
around in the backyard?

10:04.082 --> 10:05.544
Just trying to be fatherly.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.635
Dad.

10:12.390 --> 10:14.060
I came home 'cause you were sick.

10:14.812 --> 10:16.524
-Yeah.
-So, how sick?

10:19.028 --> 10:20.574
[Victor exhales]
Chase...

10:21.158 --> 10:22.661
I'm losing time.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.462
Blacking out.

10:28.798 --> 10:32.556
Waking up in the lab, in front of tech
I don't remember building.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.687
And there's this.

10:37.816 --> 10:39.110
I think I'm infected.

10:40.112 --> 10:42.868
With, uh, something alien.

10:44.454 --> 10:47.544
It's a little parting gift from Jonah.

10:48.128 --> 10:51.468
That's why it means so much to me
that you came home when I asked.

10:51.552 --> 10:53.180
If I don't have much time left--

10:53.263 --> 10:54.474
Don't-don't say that.

10:54.558 --> 10:58.608
If I don't, I'm glad I get to spend it
with you, and your mom.

10:59.693 --> 11:00.821
As a family.

11:13.262 --> 11:15.182
This doesn't bring me any joy, Leslie.

11:15.266 --> 11:17.395
[Leslie sighs]

11:17.478 --> 11:19.567
LESLIE:
Then stop doing it.

11:19.650 --> 11:22.739
I wish I could.
But you've lost sight of the path.

11:22.823 --> 11:23.825
LESLIE: Ohh...

11:24.869 --> 11:26.496
cut the shit.

11:28.877 --> 11:31.047
This isn't about my soul.

11:31.883 --> 11:33.970
I's about you stealing
the church from me.

11:34.053 --> 11:36.809
Protecting the church from you.

11:36.893 --> 11:39.439
It means so much to so many.

11:39.523 --> 11:41.443
LESLIE:
Yeah, especially you.

11:42.028 --> 11:45.827
All this power and adulation,
it's all you've ever wanted.

11:45.911 --> 11:47.998
No, all I ever wanted was my family.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.087
Which turned out to be a lie,
thanks to you.

11:51.171 --> 11:52.173
LESLIE:
No.

11:53.342 --> 11:57.684
No, everything you always wanted
was to be part of my family

11:57.768 --> 11:59.980
so that you could get close to the church.

12:00.815 --> 12:03.445
Once the congregation
sees you for who you really are,

12:03.529 --> 12:04.949
they won't follow you.

12:05.032 --> 12:08.539
See, that is exactly why
living with you is so damaging.

12:10.292 --> 12:13.508
You convinced me
that somehow I wasn't worthy.

12:15.135 --> 12:19.060
That it wasn't my celebrity
that took this church to another level.

12:19.645 --> 12:22.441
But I get it now,
and things have changed.

12:22.526 --> 12:23.528
Have they?

12:25.740 --> 12:28.663
You're still a cardboard cutout
I used to hide the fact

12:28.746 --> 12:31.418
that I had a child with another man.

12:31.502 --> 12:32.629
Not a man.

12:32.713 --> 12:36.136
LESLIE: You are
so consumed with self-doubt,

12:36.219 --> 12:38.641
so desperate for approval,

12:38.725 --> 12:41.981
that you miss
what is right in front of you.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.862
FRANK:
What am I missing, Leslie?

12:44.945 --> 12:48.410
For starters, I'm pregnant.

12:50.582 --> 12:52.001
You idiot.

12:55.299 --> 12:57.094
FRANK:
How do you know it's mine?

12:57.178 --> 12:58.180
I don't.

12:59.975 --> 13:02.480
I'm happy to take a prenatal
paternity test if you'd like,

13:02.564 --> 13:06.237
but one thing I will not do
is get back in that white room.

13:27.196 --> 13:29.033
ALEX:
Um, I was expecting...

13:29.117 --> 13:30.662
I know who you were expecting.

13:31.496 --> 13:33.500
That's why I'm here and Liv's
at home watching Xerxes.

13:33.584 --> 13:35.880
I want to tell you this in person:

13:35.964 --> 13:38.176
Leave her the hell alone.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.055
You Wilders have done enough
to that girl.

13:40.139 --> 13:42.393
That's why I called. Right? To help.

13:45.692 --> 13:46.944
TAMAR:
Uh...

13:47.027 --> 13:48.531
do you want to lose that hand?

13:48.614 --> 13:51.704
I just want to get something
out of the glove compartment.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.252
Is this what you're looking for?

13:56.045 --> 13:57.716
Yeah.

13:57.799 --> 13:59.218
Darius got my fingerprints on it.

13:59.302 --> 14:02.474
And I've been doing some research,
and I think I know what he did with it.

14:02.559 --> 14:04.228
So you know how bad it was?

14:05.147 --> 14:06.734
Then why do you want it?

14:06.817 --> 14:09.030
Because I promised Livvie I would
get justice for Darius's murder,

14:09.113 --> 14:11.242
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

14:17.046 --> 14:18.048
Thanks.

14:19.718 --> 14:21.471
My advice to you?

14:21.555 --> 14:24.770
Ditch whatever clever plan
you got cooking up

14:24.853 --> 14:26.649
and just shoot your parents instead.

14:29.655 --> 14:31.784
-Could you tell Livvie that I--
-TAMAR: No.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.038
Listen, Mini-Wilder,
I gave you what you wanted,

14:34.121 --> 14:35.792
but it comes with a price.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.127
You and Livvie are done.

14:37.211 --> 14:41.261
You come around here again,
I will shoot you myself.

14:42.096 --> 14:45.310
I gotta go pump
before I ruin this top, so...

14:48.693 --> 14:50.697
You're gonna want
to have to step the hell back.

15:05.768 --> 15:07.856
[vibration]

15:18.627 --> 15:23.053
[storm rages]

15:26.518 --> 15:29.148
[otherworldly rush]

15:36.538 --> 15:39.418
You... you can't rescue her alone.

15:40.588 --> 15:42.091
I'm not going alone. Vaughn's coming.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.343
NICO:
Yeah, kind of worse.

15:43.426 --> 15:45.138
No, I'll go too.

15:45.932 --> 15:48.436
Not because I believe in the mission,

15:48.521 --> 15:50.608
but because I-I believe in you.

15:50.691 --> 15:52.862
KAROLINA: What happened to
"everyone goes or no one does"?

15:52.946 --> 15:55.325
I was bluffing to get everyone on board.

15:55.409 --> 15:56.829
Hashtag leadership fail.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.123
MOLLY: I'm on board too.

15:58.206 --> 15:59.208
I heard everything.
Paper thin walls.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.711
And I knew you wouldn't
let her go alone.

16:00.795 --> 16:02.590
This is so awesome!
Girls trip!

16:02.674 --> 16:04.135
Well... prison break.

16:04.218 --> 16:05.220
Prison break girl trip.

16:05.303 --> 16:06.389
Plus Vaughn.

16:06.472 --> 16:08.226
Prison break girl trip plus Vaughn.

16:08.309 --> 16:09.980
[soft chuckle]

16:16.535 --> 16:18.581
Hey, Karolina, hey, what's up?

16:26.179 --> 16:27.264
Road trip!

16:27.347 --> 16:29.101
To save my mom.

16:29.185 --> 16:32.232
Yes, totally. To save your mom.

16:32.316 --> 16:35.531
I hope she forgives me for the whole
re-conditioning thing.

16:35.615 --> 16:37.451
I had no idea Frank
would take it this far.

16:38.036 --> 16:39.831
I'm sure she will. Don't worry.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.169
Have you met your mom?

16:43.964 --> 16:44.966
Are those for us?

16:45.050 --> 16:47.429
Yeah. Check it. Snack bags!

16:48.264 --> 16:52.314
I put, uh, Sake Kit-Kats
in yours, Karolina,

16:52.397 --> 16:54.026
because I head you say
you liked them once.

16:54.109 --> 16:56.280
Like, literally once.

16:56.364 --> 16:58.619
And the coup de grace...

16:59.663 --> 17:01.082
No way! That's awesome!

17:01.165 --> 17:02.794
Gibb garb all around, guys!

17:02.877 --> 17:04.673
I mean girls. I mean women.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.808
And, uh, Nico, you're gonna
have to ixnay the ake-up-may.

17:09.891 --> 17:12.271
Goth look's a dead giveaway.

17:13.857 --> 17:16.444
Also, it represents the darkness
of the human spirit.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.156
No way in hell.

17:18.241 --> 17:20.203
VAUGHN:
Interesting choice of words.

17:20.287 --> 17:23.376
No, he's right, Nico.
You'll stand out.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.088
And I need you in there with me.

17:25.171 --> 17:27.760
VAUGHN: Also, I, uh,
didn't want to make a big deal out of it,

17:27.844 --> 17:29.848
because it's
enormemente embarrassing--

17:29.931 --> 17:30.933
No.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.021
But, back at Vassar,

17:33.104 --> 17:36.485
my nickname was kind of
Vaughn the Brawn.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.041
'Cause I was muscular.
Am muscular.

17:43.124 --> 17:46.923
So, I can handle any of the rough stuff,
if it comes to that.

17:47.925 --> 17:49.554
The Brawnster's got you.

17:58.279 --> 18:01.202
And this is our project in Zambia.

18:01.285 --> 18:03.916
We built two new schoolhouses
in four months.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.339
Shipped over 5,000 of these
to Third World countries.

18:08.341 --> 18:11.723
Even more water filtration kits
to Puerto Rico and Flint, Michigan.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.604
We're basically changing the world.

18:14.688 --> 18:17.610
All because of your parents
and the PRIDE board.

18:17.694 --> 18:19.238
They're so inspiring.

18:20.908 --> 18:24.123
Um, what, does it sound like I've been
hitting the Kool-Aid a little too hard?

18:25.125 --> 18:26.753
No. Not at all.

18:26.837 --> 18:29.801
Um, actually, I was just wondering,
what's behind there?

18:29.884 --> 18:31.638
I couldn't figure out how to open it.

18:31.722 --> 18:34.101
WENDY: Oh, that's off-limits
to everyone but the PRIDE board.

18:34.184 --> 18:36.063
Do they ever come here?

18:36.147 --> 18:37.859
Get involved directly?

18:40.196 --> 18:41.407
What is your deal?

18:41.490 --> 18:42.869
What do you mean?

18:42.952 --> 18:44.998
I mean, we had
over 2,000 applications

18:45.081 --> 18:47.377
for four internship spots this summer.

18:47.461 --> 18:49.047
It's easier to get
into Harvard than PRIDE,

18:49.131 --> 18:51.385
but you act like you don't
even want to be here.

18:51.469 --> 18:53.599
And I get that you're
the boss's kid and all, but I just--

18:53.682 --> 18:56.312
You know what? You're right.

18:56.395 --> 19:01.322
I was kind of thrown into this,
but let's start over.

19:01.405 --> 19:02.407
How can I help?

19:03.994 --> 19:07.000
Well, you can start by
sorting some of that paperwork

19:07.083 --> 19:08.712
into trash and recycling.

19:08.796 --> 19:11.258
You know, maybe take out the bins.

19:11.342 --> 19:14.139
Unless where you're from,
only the help does that sort of thing.

19:14.223 --> 19:17.062
Oh, no problem. I can do that.

19:24.828 --> 19:26.497
MEGAN: I feel weird.

19:26.581 --> 19:29.879
Like, super hungover,
except I don't remember drinking.

19:29.963 --> 19:31.758
What did we do last night?

19:31.842 --> 19:34.681
MARY:
Didn't we just crash at home?

19:34.764 --> 19:36.685
MEGAN:
Didn't we go out?

19:36.768 --> 19:38.271
MARY:
What day is it again?

19:38.354 --> 19:39.356
MEGAN:
Wednesday.

19:39.439 --> 19:40.441
MARY: Hm.

19:40.526 --> 19:43.447
MEGAN: No, it's Monday.
It's definitely Monday.

19:44.032 --> 19:45.703
I just saw Chase out there.

19:45.786 --> 19:48.040
The last time we let our kids
hang out nearby

19:48.124 --> 19:50.713
while we did some
nefarious PRIDE shit,

19:50.796 --> 19:52.007
it didn't work out so well.

19:52.090 --> 19:55.305
Anything nefarious is well hidden.
You don't have to worry.

19:55.388 --> 19:58.311
I'm worried about the current
state of PRIDE.

19:58.394 --> 20:01.902
Meaning, Dale and Stacey
are out of control.

20:01.985 --> 20:03.070
Um, sorry?

20:03.154 --> 20:04.741
ROBERT:
You poisoned Chase.

20:04.824 --> 20:06.870
STACEY:
It was just a little sodium...

20:06.953 --> 20:08.039
STACEY AND DALE:
...thiopental.

20:08.122 --> 20:11.128
TINA: You threw me down the stairs
and locked me in your little dino-lair.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.548
DALE: OK, our bad on that.

20:12.632 --> 20:14.468
STACEY: At least we didn't
mind-wipe you afterwards,

20:14.552 --> 20:15.930
though maybe we should have.

20:16.013 --> 20:18.017
GEOFFREY: We're already
down one, with Leslie gone.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.606
CATHERINE: I don't believe anyone's
buying the church's story

20:20.689 --> 20:22.317
she's on a European pilgrimage.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.532
Well, you know
what I call Leslie being MIA?

20:25.616 --> 20:27.243
Great start.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.331
And, as far as Chase is concerned,

20:29.414 --> 20:32.546
I don't know, who's up for
truth serum, round deux?

20:32.630 --> 20:34.759
We don't need to hear more
about Gert and Chase's sex life.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.556
There are other ways to get him to talk.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.269
Those weapons worked great
on the interns. Let's fire 'em up again.

20:40.353 --> 20:43.234
Easy on the bloodlust, Mama Bear.

20:43.317 --> 20:46.281
I didn't lure Chase home
so you could torture him.

20:46.365 --> 20:49.287
If we mind-wipe him,
he'll never know.

20:49.371 --> 20:51.918
Stacey, that's a little dark.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.295
CATHERINE:
Though not untrue.

20:55.425 --> 20:56.720
GEOFFREY:
You know, Victor,

20:56.803 --> 21:00.143
you were Team Weapons too,
before Chase came home.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.355
The fact that I got my son back

21:02.439 --> 21:04.986
while you all
failed miserably with yours

21:05.069 --> 21:08.702
is why we're doing things
my way going forward.

21:08.785 --> 21:11.498
Now, if anyone has a problem
with that, let's hear it.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.587
GEOFFREY:
Catherine?

21:13.670 --> 21:14.672
Good.

21:16.050 --> 21:17.052
Now...

21:17.928 --> 21:19.473
Let me tell you about the plan.

21:28.533 --> 21:29.827
This place is shrouded in mystery,

21:29.911 --> 21:31.330
even to long-term members like me.

21:31.413 --> 21:33.084
I haven't been here
since I was a kid.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.754
Definitely more Alcatraz now.

21:35.881 --> 21:38.010
VAUGHN:
It's OK, though, because...

21:38.094 --> 21:40.098
Yeah, we know.
Vaughn the Brawn.

21:40.181 --> 21:43.563
I was gonna say
because I stole Aura's Crater map,

21:43.647 --> 21:44.941
but also that.

21:45.024 --> 21:47.863
MALE VOICE ON P. A.:
Morning prayers begin...

21:47.947 --> 21:49.575
NICO:
It's worse than I thought.

21:49.659 --> 21:52.497
When we find my mom, we're gonna
have to fight our way out again.

21:52.581 --> 21:53.750
You guys ready for that?

21:53.834 --> 21:56.213
MOLLY: Always ready to kick
a little Church of Gibborim's ass.

21:57.298 --> 21:58.677
No offense.

21:59.762 --> 22:01.181
MALE VOICE ON P. A.:
Have a blessed day.

22:01.265 --> 22:03.310
Actually, change of plans.

22:04.312 --> 22:07.443
Vaughn, you lead me in,
I confront Frank alone.

22:07.528 --> 22:08.989
We can't trust him.

22:09.072 --> 22:11.326
Trust me, I know how to work him.
Years of practice.

22:11.410 --> 22:12.412
I can do this.

22:13.247 --> 22:14.750
Fine.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.420
But if there's trouble,
send up a flare.

22:16.504 --> 22:17.506
We'll come running.

22:17.590 --> 22:20.011
Wait, you brought a flare gun?

22:24.937 --> 22:26.231
[Nico sighs]

22:32.536 --> 22:33.955
KAROLINA:
Hi, Dad.

22:34.039 --> 22:36.251
FRANK: Karolina.
How did you get in here?

22:36.335 --> 22:37.755
I needed to see you.

22:37.838 --> 22:40.176
You drove here by yourself?
How'd you get past the gate?

22:40.259 --> 22:41.679
KAROLINA:
They recognized me, I guess.

22:41.763 --> 22:44.267
We have a whole new security
system in place, but...

22:45.269 --> 22:47.691
never mind about that.

22:47.775 --> 22:49.695
It's great to see you.

22:49.779 --> 22:51.991
We have so much to talk about.

22:52.075 --> 22:53.452
KAROLINA:
You mean Jonah?

22:53.536 --> 22:54.580
Yes.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.709
He wasn't my father.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.630
He donated DNA. That's all.

22:59.757 --> 23:00.968
You've raised me.

23:01.552 --> 23:03.097
Not him.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.600
You're my dad.

23:05.978 --> 23:07.690
And he's gone now, so...

23:07.773 --> 23:11.029
And you and I can lead the church
into the future together.

23:11.113 --> 23:12.323
You and me.

23:13.827 --> 23:14.870
And Mom.

23:16.206 --> 23:17.835
I know she's here. Can I see her?

23:17.918 --> 23:19.922
Your mother has
turned her back on the church.

23:20.006 --> 23:21.216
KAROLINA:
Then I want to help.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.722
If she's lost her way,
she needs both of us.

23:23.805 --> 23:25.391
She may be beyond reach.

23:25.976 --> 23:28.147
She's an elite ultra.

23:28.230 --> 23:30.067
She's never beyond reach.

23:33.032 --> 23:34.744
You still believe.

23:34.827 --> 23:36.496
KAROLINA:
In the church.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.417
And in our family.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.089
But you can't keep her here
if she wants to leave.

23:41.173 --> 23:44.012
That's only going to drive her
further into the darkness.

23:45.599 --> 23:46.642
Let me see her.

23:46.726 --> 23:50.316
You taught me that anything
is possible if I believe.

23:51.611 --> 23:53.573
I know I can lead her back to the light.

23:55.577 --> 23:57.038
Maybe you're right.

23:57.121 --> 23:59.292
But we go see her together.

23:59.376 --> 24:00.796
She's in pretty rough shape.

24:10.982 --> 24:11.984
Mom?

24:14.072 --> 24:15.074
[door locks]

24:15.157 --> 24:16.368
Dad, no!

24:17.955 --> 24:20.710
FRANK: I spent nearly 20 years
with your mother, Karolina,

24:20.794 --> 24:22.380
and you're not nearly as good a liar.

24:23.842 --> 24:24.844
I'm sorry...

24:26.471 --> 24:27.473
but I have no choice.

24:29.060 --> 24:30.897
You know this room can't hold me.

24:30.981 --> 24:32.943
FRANK:
Your powers can't help you.

24:33.026 --> 24:34.822
There's no Wizard Tech at the Crater.

24:34.905 --> 24:37.536
There's nothing electronic at all,
therefore nothing for your light

24:37.619 --> 24:39.372
to hijack.

24:39.456 --> 24:41.544
We're old school out here.

24:45.677 --> 24:47.180
Dad, this isn't you.

24:49.894 --> 24:52.106
It's who you and your mother
have forced me to become.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.321
I'm sorry, Karolina.

24:56.490 --> 24:57.659
I really am.

24:57.743 --> 24:59.078
-[knocking on door]
-KAROLINA: Dad.

25:00.164 --> 25:01.667
Dad!

25:01.751 --> 25:04.339
Dad, no, please, don't leave me in here!
Dad, please, no!

25:04.422 --> 25:07.428
Dad, please let me out!
Please, Dad, don't do this, Dad!

25:08.723 --> 25:10.226
Dad, please let me out!

25:18.075 --> 25:19.077
[Karolina grunts]

25:20.872 --> 25:22.250
SUSAN:
Karolina Dean.

25:22.333 --> 25:23.628
Who are you?

25:25.507 --> 25:29.222
I've been S4E2R for decades.

25:29.305 --> 25:31.309
KAROLINA: Well, I don't do the whole
"numbers not names" thing,

25:31.393 --> 25:33.606
and don't bother trying to convert me.

25:33.690 --> 25:36.654
I said I've been that person
for many years.

25:36.737 --> 25:37.948
That's not who I am.

25:38.031 --> 25:40.369
I know that now,
because of your mother.

25:40.954 --> 25:43.292
My mom? Where is she?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.377
MAN: [distant]
Have a blessed day.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.462
WOMAN: [distant]
And to you.

25:47.926 --> 25:50.557
She's close.
That's why I'm here.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.642
I don't understand.

25:51.726 --> 25:54.188
My name is Susan.

25:56.234 --> 25:58.948
Many years ago, I fell in love
with a man named David.

25:59.032 --> 26:01.286
He was handsome
and he was passionate,

26:01.369 --> 26:04.793
and he preached these wild ideas
about energy and light

26:04.877 --> 26:09.135
and elevated consciousness,
and everything was beautiful.

26:09.970 --> 26:12.893
Until someone showed up

26:12.976 --> 26:16.984
claiming to be the embodiment
of his peyote-filled dream.

26:17.819 --> 26:18.821
Jonah?

26:20.282 --> 26:22.495
He could make himself light,

26:22.579 --> 26:24.165
but he had darkness inside.

26:24.248 --> 26:25.877
David couldn't see it, but I could.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.173
MAN ON SECURITY RADIO:
Perimeter check. All sections report.

26:28.256 --> 26:29.677
MAN #2: Section One clear.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.597
I watched helplessly

26:31.681 --> 26:34.394
as he poisoned everything
David and I had built,

26:34.477 --> 26:35.897
and then...

26:37.567 --> 26:41.282
he turned his gaze
on my daughter.

26:43.412 --> 26:45.457
And when I tried to protect her...

26:47.002 --> 26:48.338
they sent me away.

26:48.422 --> 26:49.550
Here.

26:50.635 --> 26:51.887
You're my grandmother?

26:52.723 --> 26:55.352
They never told me I had a granddaughter.

26:55.436 --> 26:57.649
They never told me about you.

26:57.733 --> 27:00.530
If they had, I would have fought
harder not to forget.

27:00.613 --> 27:03.410
The church said that you'd abandoned us,
that no one knew where you were.

27:03.493 --> 27:04.495
They lied.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.794
And I'm sorry we both had to find out
this way, but there's no time.

27:07.878 --> 27:10.842
We have to go help your mother
before it's too late.

27:16.436 --> 27:19.693
MALE VOICE ON P. A.: All chores
must be finished before curfew.

27:19.777 --> 27:22.991
[indistinct conversation]

27:25.622 --> 27:29.045
They went deeper into the compound,
towards the rehabilitation rooms.

27:29.128 --> 27:30.172
MOLLY: Sounds bad.
We should go in.

27:30.255 --> 27:33.220
Or that-that's where Leslie's being held,
and Karolina's plan's working.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.723
I don't know, I got a bad feeling.

27:34.807 --> 27:35.934
NICO:
She hasn't shot off a flare.

27:36.017 --> 27:37.019
Or she tried and we didn't see it.

27:37.102 --> 27:39.148
Guys, I don't think she's got a flare gun.

27:39.232 --> 27:41.529
We go in half-assed, we could blow
our cover and put her in danger.

27:41.612 --> 27:44.492
We won't. Just get the staff out,
and we're gonna need one of your spells.

27:44.576 --> 27:46.580
Like a magic staff?
Like Harry Potter?

27:46.664 --> 27:48.375
-Molly, I'm in charge.
-t's kind of unofficial.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.087
So you think
you're some kind of wizard?

27:50.170 --> 27:52.132
Is this about you being afraid
to use the staff,

27:52.216 --> 27:54.053
because of the whole darkness thing,

27:54.136 --> 27:55.389
and making that strike team disintegrate?

27:55.472 --> 27:56.642
Wait, what?

27:56.725 --> 27:58.144
Are you some kind of wizard?

27:58.228 --> 27:59.940
MOLLY:
Because you're really brave,

28:00.023 --> 28:02.696
and she might need us,
so I think you should get the staff out.

28:04.490 --> 28:05.492
Fine.

28:05.577 --> 28:08.583
We'll move closer so we can see
a flare if she sends one up,

28:08.666 --> 28:11.004
but, until she calls for us, we wait.

28:14.887 --> 28:18.393
I mean, for all we know,
Karolina's with her mom right now.

28:18.476 --> 28:19.563
LESLIE: Frank!

28:19.646 --> 28:21.734
You son of a bitch,
let me out of here!

28:26.117 --> 28:27.202
[gasps]

28:29.123 --> 28:30.543
Are you really here?

28:30.627 --> 28:32.296
You-you came for me?

28:33.340 --> 28:34.593
[quavering] Honey!

28:34.676 --> 28:35.845
KAROLINA: Are you OK?

28:38.099 --> 28:39.226
Yeah.

28:39.310 --> 28:40.395
KAROLINA:
Don't worry, this is--

28:40.479 --> 28:41.899
I know who she is.

28:41.982 --> 28:43.736
It looks like she does too now.

28:43.819 --> 28:46.449
I do. I'm sorry about before.

28:46.533 --> 28:48.161
KAROLINA:
Can we do all the family drama later?

28:48.244 --> 28:50.248
We need to leave
before Frank realizes I'm gone.

28:50.332 --> 28:51.543
Which way to the main gates?

28:51.627 --> 28:54.465
Wait a minute,
that's not what this is.

28:54.549 --> 28:56.637
I'm-I'm not helping you run away.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.056
What do you mean?

28:58.139 --> 29:00.268
You need to stay here, both of you.

29:00.352 --> 29:02.565
You're the rightful heirs to the church.

29:02.649 --> 29:05.278
We could expose Frank here,
turn the believers against him,

29:05.362 --> 29:07.324
and take everything back.

29:07.408 --> 29:09.286
LESLIE: No.

29:09.370 --> 29:11.290
Once we are safely out of here,

29:11.374 --> 29:13.921
then we can shut this place down,
and the church too.

29:14.005 --> 29:17.554
Frank Dean can still be purged.

29:17.637 --> 29:19.265
KAROLINA: I'm sorry,
but we're not staying here.

29:19.348 --> 29:21.603
And if you won't help us,
we'll do it on our own, OK?

29:21.687 --> 29:22.689
Come on, Mom, let's go.

29:22.772 --> 29:23.774
SUSAN: Karolina.

29:24.860 --> 29:28.491
This place is a fortress.
You'll never get out of here without me.

29:28.576 --> 29:29.578
LESLIE:
Then help us.

29:31.372 --> 29:32.667
Mom...

29:32.751 --> 29:34.211
please.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.315
You realize the risk of accidental death
by firearm increases elevenfold

29:44.398 --> 29:47.196
when some teenage idiot
actually brings a gun into the house.

29:47.279 --> 29:48.532
Don't worry.

29:48.616 --> 29:50.243
It's not gonna be here for long.

29:50.327 --> 29:51.580
GERT:
Good.

29:51.663 --> 29:54.544
Revenge isn't gonna
make you feel any better.

29:54.628 --> 29:57.257
Like, every study says that.

29:58.093 --> 30:00.472
Well, it's not revenge I'm going for.

30:00.556 --> 30:01.558
It's justice.

30:01.642 --> 30:02.644
Hm.

30:04.396 --> 30:06.109
Kind of looks like revenge to me.

30:08.196 --> 30:09.198
Agree to disagree.

30:09.281 --> 30:11.870
And I have to get
back to my hacking, so...

30:11.954 --> 30:13.164
[Gert chuckles]

30:13.248 --> 30:17.339
Kind of wish you could, uh,
hack into Chase's brain,

30:17.422 --> 30:19.135
make him come back.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.141
Oh, that's sweet.
You think he still has one.

30:22.224 --> 30:26.232
GERT: OK, look, I mean, I get that you're
all "facts not feelings" these days,

30:26.315 --> 30:29.363
but, I mean, that stuff about Chase
being the first to go...

30:31.450 --> 30:33.539
Do you really not care about him?

30:35.041 --> 30:36.460
Or any of us?

30:37.797 --> 30:41.220
Caring about people hasn't worked out
so well for me lately.

30:41.304 --> 30:43.642
[Gert's stomach rumbles loudly]

30:45.646 --> 30:47.775
ALEX:
OK, you need medical attention

30:47.859 --> 30:49.696
for whatever
that situation is right there.

30:49.779 --> 30:51.950
Sorry. I'm just-- I--

30:52.034 --> 30:55.290
Weird! I just got, like,
really hungry.

30:55.373 --> 30:57.670
[Old Lace roars]

30:57.754 --> 31:00.175
That growl sounded angry.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.179
Does her face look angry to you?

31:02.262 --> 31:06.395
Well, hon, she has 70 blade-sharp teeth,
designed to strip flesh from bone.

31:06.479 --> 31:08.358
Anger's kind of her resting face.

31:08.441 --> 31:12.407
Sweetie, she's not gonna eat tempeh
marinated in Sriracha sauce.

31:14.119 --> 31:16.249
[Old Lace growls]

31:18.671 --> 31:20.215
Girl likes her chili peppers.

31:21.342 --> 31:23.012
Or your sauce
reminds her of carrion.

31:23.096 --> 31:24.599
[deep belch]

31:27.271 --> 31:28.273
GERT:
Oh.

31:29.483 --> 31:31.738
That... was really gross.

31:32.865 --> 31:35.203
But also incredible.

31:36.873 --> 31:38.877
I really want you to leave right now.

31:38.961 --> 31:40.380
GERT:
No, wait, hang on, no!

31:40.463 --> 31:41.675
That actually tastes like

31:41.758 --> 31:46.560
Dale's secret, special,
disgusting marinade.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.479
That must be Old Lace.
She's alive!

31:48.564 --> 31:51.820
And... and she's being fed
fake steaks at Casa d'Yorkes,

31:51.903 --> 31:53.907
probably 'cause there's
no real meat in the house,

31:53.991 --> 31:55.828
which they're really
gonna need to remedy

31:55.911 --> 31:57.122
if Old Lace is staying there.

31:57.205 --> 32:00.420
But as long as there's something
sustainable and organic and grass-fed--

32:02.884 --> 32:03.886
She's okay.

32:05.263 --> 32:06.307
And we're still connected,

32:06.390 --> 32:09.229
and that means that I'm not completely
alone in this universe anymore!

32:10.524 --> 32:11.526
See ya!

32:12.904 --> 32:14.239
So happy for you.

32:29.521 --> 32:33.821
MAN: And as it is written
in the Book of Gibborim,

32:33.904 --> 32:36.618
be one with the light.

32:37.202 --> 32:40.125
Let the light envelop you.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.423
The light comes from within.

32:44.258 --> 32:45.468
LESLIE:
Just keep your heads down.

32:45.553 --> 32:47.180
Should I call in my friends?
They can fight.

32:47.264 --> 32:49.393
No. We fight, we lose.

32:50.478 --> 32:52.900
You have release papers
signed by Mr. Dean?

32:52.984 --> 32:54.194
You need them to leave.

32:54.278 --> 32:57.033
Yes, we have them. Here.

33:05.175 --> 33:06.803
We could rush through the gates
and take out those guards.

33:06.887 --> 33:09.684
Not yet. If they can get through
on their own, no one has to get hurt.

33:12.982 --> 33:14.944
OK. Let 'em through.

33:15.028 --> 33:17.407
[gate buzzes]

33:22.627 --> 33:23.754
Karolina, stop.

33:26.175 --> 33:27.469
Those are apostates escaping!

33:27.553 --> 33:28.555
Run.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.268
[alarm blares]

33:39.076 --> 33:40.704
-Now?
-Now.

33:43.627 --> 33:45.463
Ohh!
Oh, the staff is real.

33:45.548 --> 33:47.552
So you are a wizard.
Why are your eyes yellow?

33:47.635 --> 33:50.558
And the world is spinning so fast.
Why is it spinning so fast?

33:51.935 --> 33:52.937
Leave him!

33:53.020 --> 33:55.526
[alarm blares]

34:11.516 --> 34:13.562
FRANK: Take them down,

34:13.645 --> 34:15.690
or they will destroy our beloved church.

34:15.774 --> 34:17.193
No one has to get hurt.

34:17.277 --> 34:19.574
Surrender, and no one will.

34:25.753 --> 34:28.759
[otherworldly rush]

34:30.094 --> 34:32.641
[onlookers gasp]

34:43.914 --> 34:45.333
The Radiance.

34:45.918 --> 34:49.091
Karolina, stop it, right now.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.804
[awestruck murmurs]

34:54.476 --> 34:56.981
For my light
will shine through another,

34:57.065 --> 35:00.739
and cast out the darkness
covering the earth

35:00.823 --> 35:03.411
and lead you to your destiny,

35:03.494 --> 35:06.626
where you will walk
as children of the light

35:06.710 --> 35:09.423
and shine as brightly
as the sky above.

35:20.153 --> 35:21.906
FRANK: No. No!

35:21.990 --> 35:24.327
This is not the Radiance.
This is not the prophecy.

35:24.411 --> 35:25.873
This is...

35:25.956 --> 35:27.585
She is not who you--

35:34.724 --> 35:36.101
Open the gates.

35:36.686 --> 35:37.897
Open the gates.

35:37.980 --> 35:41.153
[gates buzz]

35:47.207 --> 35:48.417
Come with us.

35:49.504 --> 35:52.718
Wait, don't you see?
Don't you see?

35:52.802 --> 35:56.266
Everything I ever learned here,
it's real.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.352
No.

35:57.435 --> 35:59.481
I-It's not.

35:59.565 --> 36:02.487
There's-there's
so much more for you out there,

36:02.571 --> 36:04.074
everything they took from you.

36:04.157 --> 36:06.830
SUSAN:
Your father was right about everything.

36:06.913 --> 36:09.877
He was right about the church,
about your destiny.

36:12.131 --> 36:13.342
I need you.

36:15.931 --> 36:18.520
Now more than ever,
with this new baby on the way.

36:18.603 --> 36:20.106
Please.

36:20.189 --> 36:22.695
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

36:22.778 --> 36:25.784
But I'm... I'm needed here now.

36:25.868 --> 36:29.416
I need to purify the church
from Frank's corruption.

36:29.917 --> 36:31.921
This is my home now.

36:42.358 --> 36:43.360
Thank you.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.213
[soft chuckle]

37:16.385 --> 37:18.055
[Vaughn gasps]

37:18.138 --> 37:19.767
Guys, I got this.

37:19.850 --> 37:20.852
I got it.

37:20.936 --> 37:22.564
MOLLY:
Fight's over, Brawnster.

37:22.648 --> 37:23.650
Did we save her?

37:23.733 --> 37:26.698
I don't know what happened,
but it was awesome.

37:28.535 --> 37:30.664
Ah, you're-you're an angel.

37:31.498 --> 37:32.500
Let's go home.

37:46.863 --> 37:48.115
That man...

37:49.117 --> 37:51.163
is the real apostate.

37:51.246 --> 37:55.505
He tried to steal the church
from my daughter and my granddaughter.

37:55.589 --> 37:57.216
No, that is not what--

37:57.300 --> 37:58.845
Get off of me. I am Frank Dean!

37:58.928 --> 38:01.433
You will listen to me as I journey
into the brightness!

38:01.517 --> 38:05.191
And I am the light,
and I am the truth, and you...!

38:05.274 --> 38:09.407
You know what we do to heretics here,
don't you, Frank?

38:09.491 --> 38:12.205
FRANK: Listen to me!
I built this church!

38:12.288 --> 38:14.292
This is my church!

38:20.096 --> 38:22.518
You can't do this! I'm Frank Dean!

38:22.601 --> 38:24.395
I run this church!

38:24.479 --> 38:25.899
No!

38:26.483 --> 38:28.613
NICO:
Welcome to our home.

38:28.696 --> 38:30.992
[Leslie chuckles]

38:31.076 --> 38:33.497
LESLIE:
This is where you've been living?

38:33.581 --> 38:34.917
MOLLY:
Awesome, right?

38:35.000 --> 38:36.002
ALEX: Whoa!

38:36.838 --> 38:38.716
What the hell is she doing here?
We did not agree to this.

38:38.800 --> 38:39.802
KAROLINA: She needs us.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.181
After what happened to her
at the Crater, she can't be alone.

38:42.265 --> 38:43.685
OK, well, then you can both go.

38:43.768 --> 38:44.770
LESLIE: I'm pregnant.

38:47.609 --> 38:50.281
I don't-- I don't really have
anywhere else to go.

38:52.076 --> 38:55.082
Alex, she's basically
like the Queen Mother,

38:55.166 --> 38:56.459
or the Virgin Mary.

38:56.544 --> 38:59.925
I don't know. I mean,
if that baby's anything like Karolina,

39:00.009 --> 39:02.221
then we need her here.

39:02.305 --> 39:04.225
She does already know
where the hostel is.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.522
There's no putting that genie
back in the bottle.

39:06.606 --> 39:09.110
NICO: She's a runaway now,
just like us.

39:09.194 --> 39:10.530
She stays.

39:10.614 --> 39:15.372
Well, it is good to know we're not even
pretending it's a democracy anymore.

39:16.751 --> 39:20.842
Thank you for getting me out of there
when no one else would.

39:21.928 --> 39:24.642
Get some rest.
We'll talk more in the morning.

39:25.226 --> 39:27.230
I'll take her to a spot near us.

39:27.313 --> 39:28.315
Come on.

39:31.781 --> 39:33.785
GERT: Hey, so, uh,
next time you guys go

39:33.868 --> 39:38.836
on a super secret sisterhood road trip,
maybe don't forget the driver.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.422
-'K?
-'K.

39:45.224 --> 39:46.894
NICO: What happened back there, um...

39:47.980 --> 39:49.608
how did you do that?

39:51.152 --> 39:53.115
I don't know, I just felt this...

39:53.198 --> 39:55.160
surge take over me,

39:55.244 --> 39:56.454
and I just let go.

39:59.002 --> 40:00.547
Well, it was breathtaking.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.260
It was an act, a lie.

40:03.343 --> 40:05.724
I preyed on those people's beliefs.

40:05.807 --> 40:09.147
Well, people who were
trying to hurt you,

40:09.230 --> 40:10.859
and your mom and a lot of others.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.320
No.

40:12.403 --> 40:13.405
You were brilliant.

40:15.785 --> 40:18.165
I'm just glad you were
by my side through it all.

40:21.254 --> 40:22.256
Actually...

40:24.010 --> 40:25.555
I-I wasn't.

40:26.891 --> 40:31.274
I-I said it was strategy
to stay outside the gates, but I...

40:32.360 --> 40:33.821
I was actually scared...

40:34.823 --> 40:38.998
of that staff,
and of what I might do with it.

40:39.833 --> 40:41.754
-It's OK, Nico.
-NICO: No, it's not.

40:42.589 --> 40:45.344
You could have been hurt,
or worse.

40:45.427 --> 40:47.557
And that's on me.

40:47.641 --> 40:50.522
How can I lead this group
if I'm afraid to use my powers?

40:52.651 --> 40:55.322
After the strike team, I...

40:58.078 --> 40:59.706
I don't even know what I did.

41:04.424 --> 41:08.306
Have you thought that maybe
your darkness is you?

41:09.308 --> 41:10.436
Your power?

41:10.520 --> 41:12.398
Like how my light is for me?

41:13.483 --> 41:16.364
I was afraid to embrace my powers,

41:16.448 --> 41:18.285
to be different.

41:18.368 --> 41:19.370
To be a freak.

41:21.082 --> 41:26.510
But, my true light, it comes from
being both human and alien.

41:28.556 --> 41:29.975
I'm something new.

41:31.478 --> 41:33.608
Maybe you're finding
your real power too.

41:35.319 --> 41:37.031
You really are amazing.

41:37.114 --> 41:38.116
KAROLINA:
I know.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.578
[both chuckle]

42:06.130 --> 42:07.717
WENDY: Hey, boss's kid.

42:08.719 --> 42:10.097
Great job with the trash today.

42:10.180 --> 42:11.182
[scoffs]

42:11.266 --> 42:13.270
Uh, you were hazing me, right?

42:13.353 --> 42:15.023
WENDY:
Oh, I absolutely was hazing you.

42:15.650 --> 42:17.612
But now I feel guilty.

42:17.696 --> 42:22.288
So, a few of us are heading to
this gallery thing in the Arts District.

42:22.371 --> 42:25.043
You should come. It'll be fun.

42:25.127 --> 42:26.129
So...

42:26.212 --> 42:27.214
shall we?

42:27.298 --> 42:28.676
I, uh, I wish I could, but...

42:28.759 --> 42:31.807
Well, just in case
you change your mind.

43:08.839 --> 43:09.841
So...

43:10.843 --> 43:12.096
what have you found?

43:12.806 --> 43:13.808
Found?

43:14.643 --> 43:17.314
Well, come on, Chase, we both
know you only agreed to come here

43:17.398 --> 43:19.695
so you could snoop, so...

43:19.778 --> 43:21.322
what have you discovered?

43:22.784 --> 43:26.499
Well, uh, pretty sure that Megan
and Mary are functional alcoholics.

43:26.583 --> 43:27.585
[chuckles]

43:27.669 --> 43:29.715
Other than that, no, nothing.

43:29.798 --> 43:32.386
Well, as I said, we're, uh,
we're different now.

43:33.471 --> 43:36.729
The problem is, I know what PRIDE
does when no one is looking,

43:36.812 --> 43:39.735
so I'm not buying the bullshit.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.030
In fact, I'm pretty sure that
the criminal stuff

43:42.114 --> 43:43.743
is happening right behind this wall.

43:44.326 --> 43:47.040
Oh, y-you want to know
what's behind here?

43:54.346 --> 43:56.225
[Victor sighs]

43:58.229 --> 43:59.356
It's your future.

44:01.820 --> 44:06.370
Everything we've built
is for the next generation.

44:07.582 --> 44:08.584
For you.

44:10.462 --> 44:11.882
It's your birthright.

44:11.965 --> 44:14.971
I told you, I don't want
anything to do with PRIDE.

44:15.055 --> 44:17.476
It's true, we have done things
that we are not proud of.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.188
Under duress from Jonah.

44:19.271 --> 44:21.527
And nothing we say or do
will bring those kids back.

44:21.610 --> 44:24.198
We've all done a lot wrong,
but we did one thing right:

44:24.281 --> 44:25.283
You kids.

44:25.367 --> 44:28.414
Well, and a genetically
engineered dieinonychus,

44:28.498 --> 44:29.876
just to say it.

44:29.960 --> 44:31.797
You can use PRIDE's resources

44:31.880 --> 44:34.051
to make up for what we have done.

44:34.134 --> 44:39.144
Think of it. With all this money,
technology, power,

44:39.228 --> 44:41.107
you could change the world.

44:41.190 --> 44:44.698
And I'm supposed to believe that, what,
you're all just gonna walk away from this?

44:44.781 --> 44:48.998
Some of us want nothing more
than to just be moms and dads again,

44:49.081 --> 44:51.210
and when you're all ready,

44:51.294 --> 44:53.423
the rest will step aside too.

44:53.507 --> 44:56.847
But... it starts with you, Chase.

44:58.517 --> 45:00.270
You have to take the first step.

45:00.353 --> 45:01.857
Lead the rest.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.861
STACEY: You can save the world
and your friends.

45:03.944 --> 45:05.155
You can be the hero.

45:05.238 --> 45:10.415
All you have to do is step inside...
and join us at that table.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.129
Promise me none of them get hurt.

45:14.214 --> 45:15.635
I promise, son.
