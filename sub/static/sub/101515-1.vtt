WEBVTT

01:32.833 --> 01:35.769
- Five seconds.
- After this person.

01:42.676 --> 01:44.879
- And clear.
- Not clear.

01:49.950 --> 01:51.486
- Go.
- No.

01:55.956 --> 01:57.759
Now.

02:44.872 --> 02:46.474
This could be cash.

02:46.506 --> 02:48.542
No. Money order.

02:50.410 --> 02:51.511
Twenty.

02:51.545 --> 02:53.381
Oh, I think
they sell these at...

02:53.414 --> 02:55.450
I have a receipt
that'll work for this.

03:02.054 --> 03:04.958
- Hmm.
- Toys and games. 12.99, Target. Easy return.

03:04.992 --> 03:07.762
So, this is,
this is not a cheap tie.

03:11.765 --> 03:14.434
Well, you can't see it, because
you're not of gentle birth.

03:22.809 --> 03:24.144
It's empty!

04:01.949 --> 04:04.584
Althea and Victor Young.

04:04.618 --> 04:08.789
4305 Fairglen Road,
Ladera Heights.

04:08.821 --> 04:11.926
Oh. We could take the 2.

04:11.958 --> 04:14.060
It goes there from here.

04:14.094 --> 04:15.897
We got time.

04:17.797 --> 04:21.901
Um, do the Catholic
schoolgirl costume.

04:21.934 --> 04:23.903
'Cause you've got
some heartstrings to pull.

04:23.937 --> 04:25.872
And remember,
don't ask for a reward.

04:25.905 --> 04:27.641
Just let them come to you.

04:27.674 --> 04:29.543
- You got the watch, right?
- Yeah.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.852
Wow. Look at this.

04:38.886 --> 04:41.888
It was just right there.
I almost stepped on it.

04:41.922 --> 04:44.624
All this time,
it was just right there.

04:44.658 --> 04:45.626
Yeah.

04:45.658 --> 04:46.993
Do you go to Sacred Heart?

04:48.929 --> 04:50.196
Our daughter Jenny
went to Sacred Heart.

04:50.230 --> 04:51.866
Here, let's have you
in for a Coke.

04:51.898 --> 04:53.900
I've always believed in angels.

04:53.934 --> 04:55.770
Not me. That's her thing.

05:01.708 --> 05:02.977
What's this?

05:03.009 --> 05:04.944
It's a gift certificate.

05:04.977 --> 05:07.213
Their daughter's a masseuse.

05:08.982 --> 05:11.150
"Don't ask for a reward"
was plan A.

05:11.184 --> 05:13.987
Plan B was "ask for a reward."

05:14.021 --> 05:15.922
Rich people can be
very cheap sometimes.

05:15.956 --> 05:18.792
They were talking
about her nonstop.

05:18.824 --> 05:21.295
- She works at Mélisse, she went to college...
- Mélisse?

05:21.328 --> 05:24.131
They were obsessed.
It was creepy.

05:24.163 --> 05:26.566
That's the most expensive
restaurant in L.A.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.135
- She just works there.
- Well, uh, even to work there,

05:28.167 --> 05:29.670
you have to be rich.

05:29.703 --> 05:32.006
- Oh. I mean, I...
- Wait a minute. Wait.

05:32.038 --> 05:35.141
4305 1/2 Fairglen Road.

05:35.175 --> 05:37.143
4... 4503 1/2 Fairglen...

05:37.177 --> 05:39.179
You-you were just...
Well, you were just there.

05:39.211 --> 05:42.182
But th-this is, this is
the house right behind it.

05:42.215 --> 05:44.785
- This is worth money.
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:44.817 --> 05:46.653
- See, dollar signs.
- Yeah.

05:46.687 --> 05:49.122
This-this...

05:49.155 --> 05:52.025
This type of high-end,
uh... you know.

05:52.059 --> 05:54.028
- It's good. Yeah.
- It's worth $200 or $300.

05:54.061 --> 05:55.596
Yeah.

05:56.763 --> 05:58.566
Okay, um...

05:58.598 --> 06:00.634
Wait.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.136
Cash refund.

06:05.138 --> 06:07.174
<i>Okay. What about a percentage</i>

06:07.206 --> 06:08.141
of the total value?

06:08.175 --> 06:10.177
Like 75% of the total value.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.746
No. No, that's not how...

06:12.778 --> 06:13.913
I'm sorry.

06:13.946 --> 06:15.749
How do you, how do you
know my parents?

06:15.782 --> 06:19.086
Or what about an exchange,
um, for that rock?

06:21.622 --> 06:22.622
- No.
- No? Okay.

06:22.655 --> 06:23.691
- Mm-mm.
- What about these?

06:24.790 --> 06:26.326
No? Understood.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.761
This. This, uh, this shelf.

06:28.795 --> 06:32.032
And that's gonna be my final,
because it's just...

06:32.064 --> 06:34.134
it's not worth very much
and I'm gonna be

06:34.167 --> 06:36.637
taking a loss on-on...

06:39.172 --> 06:40.874
...on the massage.

06:46.946 --> 06:48.648
I'll take that.

06:53.319 --> 06:55.855
Well, you don't want
a massage, right?

06:59.025 --> 07:01.662
How long does this
usually take?

07:01.694 --> 07:05.131
Uh, your gift certificate
is for 60 minutes, so...

07:05.165 --> 07:06.367
Oh. N-No.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.135
I-I don't need, um... could...

07:08.167 --> 07:11.771
Do you think
we could do it in 20?

07:11.804 --> 07:13.139
Okay.

07:46.006 --> 07:47.307
Okay.

07:47.340 --> 07:49.876
So just tell me
if it's too much pressure.

07:49.910 --> 07:51.912
It's too much pressure.

07:54.848 --> 07:56.884
- Is this better?
- Too much.

08:02.855 --> 08:05.860
How about this?

08:24.177 --> 08:25.879
Is that better?

08:29.449 --> 08:31.151
Yeah.

08:59.445 --> 09:01.415
- Hi.
- We're with her.

09:01.448 --> 09:03.083
It was taking a while, so...

09:03.116 --> 09:04.985
No refund?

09:05.017 --> 09:08.454
No. I don't refund
gifts, but we're almost done.

09:08.487 --> 09:11.824
She only wanted 20 minutes.

09:11.857 --> 09:15.128
Okay, can we have that rock
for the other 40 minutes?

09:15.161 --> 09:16.896
We won the Vitafusion giveaway

09:16.929 --> 09:19.232
under six
different names today.

09:19.266 --> 09:26.006
Oh. And the <i>Motor Trend</i>
Dodge Viper GT Sweepstakes.

09:26.039 --> 09:28.876
- That's a free visor.
- The little ones are popping!

09:28.909 --> 09:30.244
Pop, pop, pop!

09:30.276 --> 09:31.410
They're all popping!

09:31.444 --> 09:34.080
Just st-stop. Hey. Okay?

09:34.113 --> 09:36.016
Who's in charge of the, um...

09:36.049 --> 09:40.821
A sport water bottle, BPA-free,
with a carabiner.

09:40.853 --> 09:43.223
- Huh.
- I don't think we've won that before.

09:46.226 --> 09:48.162
Not bad for a Wednesday.

09:48.194 --> 09:49.929
Hey, yo!

09:53.266 --> 09:55.935
Hey. Hey!

10:24.130 --> 10:25.432
Hey, you guys?

10:25.464 --> 10:26.867
I h...

10:26.900 --> 10:28.135
- I have a job.
- Shut the fuck up.

10:28.168 --> 10:29.203
- Keep walking, keep walking.
- Ah.

10:29.236 --> 10:30.571
- Fuck.
- February?

10:30.603 --> 10:32.104
March? April?

10:32.137 --> 10:33.506
Come on, man,
this tank's empty.

10:33.540 --> 10:36.376
Uh, we may have to pay
in installments.

10:36.409 --> 10:38.412
- In install... No.
- Yeah.

10:38.444 --> 10:42.148
No! No install... I mean,
rent is an installment.

10:42.181 --> 10:44.417
It's a monthly installment.

10:44.450 --> 10:46.219
We'll have it in the morning.
All...

10:46.252 --> 10:47.954
February, March, April,
all 1,500.

10:47.987 --> 10:49.122
Just, uh... yeah, we were just,

10:49.155 --> 10:51.058
we were just talking about
a job right now.

10:51.091 --> 10:52.593
- We were, just now.
- Yeah.

10:52.626 --> 10:55.328
- You only pay 500 a month?
- But it leaks.

10:55.362 --> 10:57.530
It's very
manageable. Very manageable.

10:57.564 --> 11:00.367
It's... it leaks
on-on a schedule.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.934
Y-You're patting down the wall
afterwards, right?

11:01.968 --> 11:03.136
- Oh, yeah.
- That's good.

11:03.169 --> 11:04.571
The dampness becomes rot,

11:04.603 --> 11:06.573
and then the whole building
collapses.

11:06.606 --> 11:09.076
Hey, fire up
that compressor, will you?

11:09.108 --> 11:11.545
Very expensive.

11:11.578 --> 11:13.012
Are you okay?

11:13.045 --> 11:14.881
It's my condition.

11:14.915 --> 11:17.217
- He's got a...
- I mean, I-I have no filters.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.619
It's no big deal.

11:18.651 --> 11:20.119
Ignore it.

11:21.186 --> 11:22.488
See you in the morning.

11:22.521 --> 11:24.557
Okay, we'll see you.

11:26.559 --> 11:28.028
The other side!

11:28.060 --> 11:30.162
Uh, I-I'm supposed
to take this class.

11:30.195 --> 11:32.031
It's a required thing
by my caseworker,

11:32.064 --> 11:34.133
but I'm kind of
in the midst of something,

11:34.166 --> 11:36.002
so if she could just go,
there's...

11:36.035 --> 11:37.304
there's a sign-up sheet.

11:37.337 --> 11:39.206
Come on. I-I know
you guys do this stuff.

11:39.238 --> 11:41.407
Tell them about the money!

11:41.440 --> 11:43.476
I can pay $20.

11:49.516 --> 11:51.017
You heard?

11:51.050 --> 11:52.419
Yeah, well, what about the...

11:52.452 --> 11:55.622
Yeah, so hurry up so we can go.

11:55.655 --> 11:57.190
Thanks.

12:00.327 --> 12:02.029
- I like your...
- Yeah.

12:04.396 --> 12:06.699
What's your name?

12:06.732 --> 12:08.101
Kelli.

12:08.133 --> 12:10.102
What's your name?

12:10.136 --> 12:11.972
It's for the sign-up sheet.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.140
Oh.

12:13.173 --> 12:14.441
It's Kelli Fain.

12:14.473 --> 12:17.176
Kelli with an "I," F-A-I-N.

12:17.209 --> 12:18.644
You don't even have to go in.

12:18.678 --> 12:21.314
Just get the yellow slip
and come right back.

12:23.983 --> 12:26.453
Oh, Fain.

12:26.486 --> 12:28.322
I need a yellow slip.

12:28.354 --> 12:31.357
Okay.
Dorinda can give you that.

12:31.391 --> 12:33.059
Uh, she's inside.

12:56.049 --> 12:57.985
We're starting a little late.

12:58.017 --> 12:59.719
Maybe the time change
threw some people off.

12:59.752 --> 13:01.287
- L-Let's take a seat, please.
- But it's only twice.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.455
- Well, here's your slip.
- Okay. Thanks, Dorinda.

13:02.488 --> 13:04.690
Have a seat.

13:04.723 --> 13:06.593
Let's get started.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.363
If you need a caseworker
receipt from Dorinda,

13:10.396 --> 13:13.066
you can get it later
at the break.

13:14.099 --> 13:15.468
Okay.

13:15.501 --> 13:18.771
There are worksheets coming
from both directions.

13:18.804 --> 13:20.640
Uh, take one and pass it down.

13:20.673 --> 13:22.542
- Could you pass it?
- The blue one is

13:22.574 --> 13:25.679
the nutrition cheat sheet that
I mentioned to you yesterday.

13:25.712 --> 13:28.081
Please take a look
at the pink sheet,

13:28.113 --> 13:30.649
the one that says
"The Breast Crawl" on top.

13:30.683 --> 13:32.184
Will you start the tape,
please?

13:32.218 --> 13:33.219
Thank you.

13:33.252 --> 13:34.387
Okay, this is great.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.355
This is the mother-baby bond
at work.

13:36.389 --> 13:37.791
Oh.

13:37.824 --> 13:40.026
If the newborn
is immediately placed

13:40.059 --> 13:41.795
on the mother's abdomen,

13:41.828 --> 13:46.500
he makes his way all the way
to the breast all by himself.

13:46.532 --> 13:49.402
Now, if a baby's placed
on a cot,

13:49.435 --> 13:51.804
the infant mortality goes up.

13:51.838 --> 13:53.540
The bonding goes down.

13:53.573 --> 13:55.308
The lactation goes down.

13:55.341 --> 13:58.078
All that important stuff
that we talked about yesterday.

13:58.111 --> 13:59.746
You remember?

13:59.779 --> 14:02.349
Baby's mouth opens
as he approaches the nipple.

14:04.150 --> 14:06.086
And the bonding begins.

14:19.466 --> 14:22.436
Shit, girl,
what'd you do, enroll?

14:22.468 --> 14:24.070
What did I miss?

14:24.103 --> 14:27.239
Uh, the... breast crawl and...

14:27.272 --> 14:29.308
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna do that.

14:29.342 --> 14:31.045
That's cool, huh?

14:32.846 --> 14:35.549
No, you don't want
to baby it like that.

14:35.582 --> 14:37.583
It'll-it'll get all...

14:59.572 --> 15:01.508
Thank you for waiting.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.576
Someone will be
with you shortly.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.529
What are you doing?

15:22.561 --> 15:24.363
Uh...

15:24.396 --> 15:26.232
Sorry, uh...

15:26.266 --> 15:28.267
I just...

15:28.300 --> 15:31.170
We won something big,
but we can't use it.

15:31.203 --> 15:33.439
Uh, it's the Ooh La Luxe
getaway.

15:33.473 --> 15:35.608
It's a first-class trip for two
to the Big Apple,

15:35.641 --> 15:38.612
and it's redeemable for three
nonrefundable coach tickets.

15:38.645 --> 15:40.713
- You'll never fly.
- I know.

15:40.747 --> 15:43.250
So, maybe we...

15:44.883 --> 15:47.220
What is that?

15:49.588 --> 15:51.592
Guy at the class gave me them.

15:53.559 --> 15:56.328
Do... Do you want one?

15:58.397 --> 16:01.333
When a man gives you wood,

16:01.367 --> 16:04.670
anything made out of wood,

16:04.703 --> 16:08.708
he's saying,
"You give me wood."

16:20.553 --> 16:22.622
I've been to New York.

16:22.655 --> 16:25.692
You and I could go together,
just the two of us.

16:28.361 --> 16:30.797
Like a...

16:30.829 --> 16:33.333
mother-daughter getaway.

17:03.762 --> 17:05.732
Oh, hey, Stovik.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.333
There you are.

17:07.367 --> 17:09.336
That's a great jacket.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.703
You pat it down?

17:10.736 --> 17:12.271
Yeah.

17:13.306 --> 17:14.708
- Oh, Theresa, I...
- Oh.

17:14.741 --> 17:16.843
Mm-hmm.

17:16.876 --> 17:18.377
Uh, the rest is coming.

17:18.411 --> 17:20.247
Uh, we're just on our way.
We have to, uh...

17:20.280 --> 17:22.415
- What is this?
- Ah, that's a money order.

17:22.446 --> 17:24.316
- Same as money.
- $20.

17:24.348 --> 17:26.886
We have to check our mail,
and, uh...

17:26.917 --> 17:28.387
Well... Oh, that.

17:28.421 --> 17:31.691
Now, see, that...
I think that's worth 50...

17:31.723 --> 17:33.025
Not this time.

17:33.059 --> 17:34.761
Wha...?

17:34.793 --> 17:36.495
I can't do this anymore.

17:39.398 --> 17:40.766
Are you crying?

17:47.906 --> 17:49.708
I'm patching the leak.

17:49.742 --> 17:51.344
I'm evicting you.

17:51.376 --> 17:54.313
I can get $10,000
for this space, you understand?

17:54.347 --> 17:55.514
$10,000.

17:55.548 --> 17:56.782
We have a child.

17:58.050 --> 18:00.619
That wall is a sponge.
It's a sponge.

18:00.653 --> 18:02.789
This building ought to be
condemned, really.

18:02.821 --> 18:04.491
We could, we could report it

18:04.523 --> 18:07.393
to the Department of Health
and Human Services!

18:07.426 --> 18:09.728
What?

18:09.761 --> 18:10.829
Okay, okay.

18:10.863 --> 18:12.666
Just-just, just give us
till Friday.

18:12.698 --> 18:15.401
You'll have 1,500
in cash bills.

18:15.434 --> 18:16.735
We'll have it by Friday.

18:16.769 --> 18:18.338
Dude, we need a little time
to get it together.

18:20.039 --> 18:21.607
Friday tomorrow?

18:21.640 --> 18:23.075
It's tomorrow?

18:23.108 --> 18:25.477
Um, well, I didn't
literally mean...

18:25.511 --> 18:27.614
I mean, that's just a saying,
you know, "by Friday."

18:27.646 --> 18:30.416
- It just means end of the week.
- Next Friday.

18:30.450 --> 18:31.551
Uh, uh, the-the one after that.

18:31.584 --> 18:33.854
- Friday after next.
- Yeah.

18:35.053 --> 18:36.555
Two weeks.

18:36.588 --> 18:37.756
Uh-huh.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.526
Two weeks.

19:12.492 --> 19:14.094
<i>Shit! We don't have time</i>

19:14.126 --> 19:15.595
to be horsing around.

19:15.627 --> 19:16.929
That was our best thing.

19:16.963 --> 19:19.598
It's a new camera. I didn't know.

19:19.632 --> 19:21.868
This is really bad.

19:21.901 --> 19:23.703
- Mm-hmm.
- Once your face is in their system,

19:23.735 --> 19:26.572
- they got you... fines, 401, home equity.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

19:26.606 --> 19:28.575
But maybe you want all that.
I don't know.

19:28.607 --> 19:30.809
Me? I prefer to just skim.

19:30.842 --> 19:32.511
- So do I.
- Do you?

19:32.544 --> 19:33.812
Ah, that's interesting.

19:33.846 --> 19:35.714
Because most people
want to be kajillionaires.

19:35.748 --> 19:37.884
That's the dream.
That's how they get you hooked.

19:37.916 --> 19:39.852
Hooked on sugar,
hooked on caffeine.

19:39.886 --> 19:42.122
Ha-ha-ha. Cry-cry-cry.

19:42.155 --> 19:44.124
Mother-daughter getaway.

19:45.691 --> 19:48.595
How the fuck does that
help us get the rent?

19:48.627 --> 19:51.664
God. Come on! Think!

19:57.770 --> 20:00.807
Okay, so...

20:00.839 --> 20:04.010
We all fly to New York
together on Wednesday,

20:04.042 --> 20:07.012
and then we fly right back
as strangers.

20:07.046 --> 20:11.084
So, at the baggage carousel,
we don't know each other.

20:15.655 --> 20:17.757
Don't-don't look at me.

20:17.790 --> 20:20.159
I'm looking around.

20:20.193 --> 20:23.061
I want to make sure
these are our bags.

20:23.095 --> 20:25.064
- Oh.
- Excuse me, sir.

20:25.097 --> 20:27.200
Is this the luggage
for the flight from New York?

20:27.232 --> 20:28.835
You two know each other.

20:28.867 --> 20:31.069
- We're a couple?
- Yeah.

20:31.103 --> 20:33.907
Oh. I see.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.508
I am the dum-dum now.

20:35.540 --> 20:36.775
I have a bachelor's degree.

20:36.809 --> 20:38.043
She doesn't even know
what that is.

20:38.077 --> 20:43.982
Then you accidentally
take my bags and go home.

20:44.015 --> 20:46.718
I'll stay at the airport
and report my loss.

20:46.751 --> 20:49.188
Luckily, I have
traveler's insurance,

20:49.222 --> 20:53.126
so they'll issue us
a check for, uh, um...

20:54.327 --> 20:58.097
...$1,575, which we can
just sign right over to Stovik

20:58.129 --> 21:02.001
the next day and be, uh,
more than a full week early.

21:28.661 --> 21:30.230
Ladies and gentlemen, uh,

21:30.262 --> 21:32.098
we're experiencing
some choppy air here.

21:32.130 --> 21:35.100
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.

21:35.134 --> 21:37.737
We'll be going up to 37,000
feet for a smoother ride.

21:37.770 --> 21:39.606
Okay, come on. Come on.

21:39.638 --> 21:41.040
Okay.

21:42.942 --> 21:44.676
Okay.

21:44.710 --> 21:46.913
Just breathe normally.
Just breathe normally.

21:48.981 --> 21:51.217
All right, talk. Let's talk.
Okay? Talk.

21:51.250 --> 21:54.087
Let's say something.
Just say something.

21:55.721 --> 21:57.589
Don't pray.
God, are you praying?

21:57.623 --> 21:58.892
Just talk. Talk.

21:58.925 --> 21:59.893
Okay.

21:59.925 --> 22:01.927
How are you? Um...

22:03.296 --> 22:05.265
How are you?
What are your interests?

22:05.298 --> 22:07.000
- My interests?
- Your interests. Your interests. Your interests!

22:07.032 --> 22:08.534
- Your interests! Go. Go.
- I-I don't know. I don't...

22:08.568 --> 22:09.769
- What do you want me to...
- I don't know.

22:09.801 --> 22:11.103
Just say anything. Uh...

22:11.136 --> 22:12.804
Some people think
that a brand-new baby,

22:12.838 --> 22:14.973
if you, if you, if you
put it on the abdomen,

22:15.007 --> 22:17.143
it'll just automatically
crawl up to the mom's breast.

22:18.174 --> 22:20.746
But if you put it on a cot,
then it'll, I guess, cry more.

22:20.780 --> 22:22.882
But a breast crawl baby...

22:22.915 --> 22:24.149
Don't say "breast."

22:24.183 --> 22:26.118
I just wonder
how-how a baby would know

22:26.152 --> 22:27.888
- how, where...
- Shh. Stop.

22:31.156 --> 22:32.858
It's smooth now.

22:36.761 --> 22:39.098
What was the point of all that?

22:40.599 --> 22:42.601
He told me to talk.

22:44.803 --> 22:46.772
Are you pregnant?

22:49.274 --> 22:53.011
Did I crawl up,
or was I put on a cot?

22:53.044 --> 22:54.580
Answer.

22:58.283 --> 23:00.819
No.

23:00.853 --> 23:02.889
How would that
have even happened?

23:07.026 --> 23:08.828
A cot.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.597
Is she pregnant?

23:22.073 --> 23:24.009
No.

24:27.306 --> 24:28.841
Uh, my mom
lives in New Jersey.

24:28.874 --> 24:30.376
We're not that close.
I mean, we...

24:30.408 --> 24:32.778
like, hardly ever talk
now that I live in L.A.

24:32.811 --> 24:34.981
Uh, I've been here
almost a year,

24:35.013 --> 24:37.282
and, ugh, it's so hard
to meet people.

24:37.316 --> 24:39.251
Do you guys find that?
Okay. What else?

24:39.284 --> 24:41.086
Um... Um, um, um, um, um, um.

24:41.119 --> 24:43.822
I live in Highland Park,
above Thrive.

24:43.856 --> 24:44.991
So, is this the kind of thing
that you...

24:45.023 --> 24:46.224
Yeah, just keep talking.

24:46.258 --> 24:47.393
- Anything. Anything. Uh, just anything.
- Um...

24:47.425 --> 24:49.395
- Okay, um...
- Anything. Go. Go. Go.

24:49.427 --> 24:51.863
I am a, uh,
physician's assistant

24:51.896 --> 24:54.099
in ophthalmology
at Cedars-Sinai.

24:54.133 --> 24:57.136
Is this the normal amount
of turbulence for this route?

24:57.168 --> 24:58.203
Yes.

24:58.236 --> 24:59.938
- Really?
- Totally.

24:59.972 --> 25:01.473
It's... Oh, no!

25:01.507 --> 25:02.875
What?

25:02.907 --> 25:05.877
Oh.

25:05.911 --> 25:07.947
I thought that
I forgot my headphones.

25:07.980 --> 25:11.217
Did they say that there was
Wi-Fi on this plane?

25:11.250 --> 25:12.719
I don't remember.

25:12.751 --> 25:14.721
Oh, there is.
Oh, you got to pay.

25:14.753 --> 25:16.789
- Why do they do that?
- You're better off.

25:16.821 --> 25:18.156
Oh, this? Oh, I know.

25:18.190 --> 25:19.992
Trust me, I'm the worst.
I, like, sleep with it.

25:20.024 --> 25:21.460
It's like my third arm.

25:21.493 --> 25:23.361
It's a tool.

25:23.395 --> 25:25.732
It was originally designed
by and for the military

25:25.764 --> 25:27.432
and the intelligence community.

25:27.465 --> 25:30.469
The CIA and Army ground ops,
specifically.

25:30.502 --> 25:32.938
It is a powerful
and it's a dangerous tool.

25:32.972 --> 25:34.307
You don't have a cell phone?

25:34.339 --> 25:36.141
- I use it as it was intended.
- Hi.

25:36.175 --> 25:37.409
And I don't dress it up

25:37.443 --> 25:38.711
- and play dolly with it.
- Oh.

25:38.744 --> 25:41.079
Well, then don't meet my mom. She is... whew!

25:41.113 --> 25:43.249
- Here you are.
- She is always on her phone.

25:43.281 --> 25:45.217
I'm talking about, like,
always on her phone.

25:45.251 --> 25:47.819
- Oh! Yes!
- Here you are.

25:47.853 --> 25:50.022
- Screwdriver for her.
- I don't want it. I...

25:50.055 --> 25:53.126
Gin and tonic, gin and tonic.

25:53.158 --> 25:55.160
Here, open up
that bad boy. Okay.

25:55.194 --> 25:56.762
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:56.796 --> 25:59.432
Trust me, this will help a lot.
Salud.

25:59.464 --> 26:01.867
Um, my only concern
is that we won't be

26:01.901 --> 26:05.471
thinking clearly enough in
the event of a real emergency.

26:05.503 --> 26:08.006
- It's possible.
- Oh, are you...?

26:08.040 --> 26:10.143
My aunt has a friend
who's Amish.

26:11.174 --> 26:11.444
No, we're not Amish.

26:11.476 --> 26:13.178
- We use alcohol.
- Oh.

26:13.212 --> 26:16.549
When we're injured,
to numb the pain.

26:16.581 --> 26:18.150
Okay, that sounds Amish.

26:18.184 --> 26:19.918
Look, I know there's
a lot of discrimination.

26:19.952 --> 26:21.953
My friend used to go
to a Quaker school.

26:21.986 --> 26:24.089
And let me...

26:27.492 --> 26:29.561
- That's super random.
- Uh...

26:29.595 --> 26:31.164
Uh, oh. Okay!

26:31.196 --> 26:32.531
All right! Chug, chug.

26:32.565 --> 26:34.267
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.434
Yes!

26:35.466 --> 26:37.836
Let's get this party started.

26:47.512 --> 26:49.281
You never lived in Providence?

26:49.315 --> 26:51.050
I never did.

26:51.082 --> 26:52.384
It's so weird.

26:52.417 --> 26:53.819
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a girl there who looks just...

26:53.853 --> 26:56.022
He's staring at your... blouse.

26:56.055 --> 26:57.490
Oh, I know. I can handle it.

26:57.522 --> 26:58.558
Mm-hmm?

27:01.894 --> 27:03.496
Okay. All right, everybody.

27:03.529 --> 27:05.231
Check your pockets.

27:05.263 --> 27:07.599
- It may be a bait and switch.
- A what?

27:07.633 --> 27:08.968
A distraction.

27:09.001 --> 27:10.336
He might be a pickpocket.

27:10.368 --> 27:12.504
- You mean a thief?
- Yeah.

27:12.538 --> 27:14.373
That-that is, that is not
what just happened.

27:14.405 --> 27:17.143
You don't know
about these things.

27:18.174 --> 27:18.610
I don't... No.

27:18.644 --> 27:20.512
This happens to me,
like, every day.

27:20.546 --> 27:22.081
What?

27:26.918 --> 27:30.322
So... what is it
that you guys do?

27:32.357 --> 27:35.194
Oh, come on. You know
everything about me, right?

27:35.226 --> 27:37.162
You know where I live
and what my grandma's name is.

27:37.195 --> 27:38.063
So, like, what are,
what are you,

27:38.097 --> 27:40.433
what are you guys,
like... professors?

27:40.465 --> 27:42.033
Yep.

27:42.067 --> 27:43.970
Yeah? Well,
that was a really great guess.

27:44.002 --> 27:45.136
No.

27:45.169 --> 27:46.973
No, you're not.

27:47.005 --> 27:49.074
Uh-uh, uh.

27:49.107 --> 27:52.145
You're, like, um...

27:55.213 --> 27:57.183
Would you consider yourself
a trustworthy person?

27:57.215 --> 27:59.318
- Is that one of your qualities?
- You don't have to answer that.

27:59.350 --> 28:01.087
Yes.

28:02.988 --> 28:04.624
Oh.

28:04.656 --> 28:06.958
We have something very
big happening at the airport.

28:06.992 --> 28:09.095
Oh, my God, I knew
you guys were up to something.

28:09.127 --> 28:11.230
All right, there's two
of us and there's three bags.

28:11.262 --> 28:12.898
Do you see
where I'm going with this?

28:12.932 --> 28:13.966
Not at all.

28:27.212 --> 28:29.048
You took it?
Really? Put it back.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.282
Oh, yeah.

28:30.316 --> 28:32.018
I-I-I feel it. I...

28:32.050 --> 28:34.119
- Do you?
- I felt it. I-I...

28:34.153 --> 28:35.387
Mm.

28:35.421 --> 28:37.290
Okay.

28:37.322 --> 28:38.657
That old bag.

28:38.691 --> 28:40.693
Here we go. Yep.

28:44.195 --> 28:46.098
Thank you.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.435
All right.

28:50.469 --> 28:52.004
Is that the last one?

28:52.037 --> 28:54.106
She has a lot of...
way too many shoes.

28:54.138 --> 28:55.340
- Oh.
- You got everything?

28:55.374 --> 28:58.174
Okay.

28:58.309 --> 28:59.646
Off we go.

29:08.587 --> 29:11.424
All right, so if they are lost,
and I'm not saying they are,

29:11.456 --> 29:13.559
but if they are,
your traveler's insurance

29:13.591 --> 29:17.396
covers you for up to $1,575.

29:17.428 --> 29:21.099
You get that as soon as
the loss is verified.

29:21.133 --> 29:23.102
H-How long does that
usually take?

29:23.135 --> 29:24.569
Oh, they're pretty quick.

29:24.603 --> 29:26.606
Six weeks at the longest.

29:30.509 --> 29:32.712
A-And the shortest?

29:32.744 --> 29:34.446
Oh, that really varies.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.048
But don't worry.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.117
It's really rare
that we completely lose a bag.

29:39.151 --> 29:41.187
I'm sure they'll turn up.

30:02.607 --> 30:04.710
Yeah,
it's a pretty good deal here.

30:04.742 --> 30:06.145
Oh, she's here.

30:06.177 --> 30:08.113
Don't worry, I got this.

30:12.251 --> 30:13.719
Ma'am, I'll show you
right to your seat.

30:13.751 --> 30:15.021
Just go with it.

30:15.053 --> 30:16.588
How much did you get
for the bags?

30:16.621 --> 30:19.057
These guys at my college
used to do the same scam

30:19.090 --> 30:20.325
with their luggage
at Christmas vacation.

30:20.358 --> 30:21.659
- I think you can get more...
- It's-it's,

30:21.693 --> 30:23.128
it's an original con.

30:23.162 --> 30:25.564
- I invented it.
- Oh, okay.

30:25.597 --> 30:27.098
What?

30:27.132 --> 30:31.170
I don't know if the check
will be here by Friday.

30:31.203 --> 30:32.805
What?

30:32.838 --> 30:34.807
It might, but...

30:34.839 --> 30:36.509
it might take six weeks.

30:40.178 --> 30:41.479
In six weeks?

30:41.512 --> 30:43.049
That's too late.

30:43.081 --> 30:47.552
We just flew...
I just risked my life for...

30:47.586 --> 30:48.687
Sorry.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.356
In six weeks?

30:50.388 --> 30:51.823
Who knows?

30:51.857 --> 30:54.326
It could come sooner.
It varies.

30:54.358 --> 30:56.728
Right.

30:56.761 --> 30:59.298
What could come sooner?
The check?

31:01.532 --> 31:04.236
Who even is she?

31:05.337 --> 31:07.306
How is this person an asset?

31:07.338 --> 31:10.509
I don't... I don't understand.

31:14.346 --> 31:16.615
Maybe I'll go to the restroom.

31:16.647 --> 31:18.416
- It's broken.
- Huh?

31:18.450 --> 31:21.520
You have to use the
one outside by the gas station.

31:21.552 --> 31:23.522
Right.

31:47.913 --> 31:50.450
Oh.

32:09.902 --> 32:11.537
- Yes?
- There you are, hon.

32:11.569 --> 32:13.571
I've been calling nonstop.

32:13.605 --> 32:15.406
Sorry, I had it
on airplane mode.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.709
Oh, so... Okay. So you landed.

32:16.742 --> 32:18.376
You're home. Good.

32:18.409 --> 32:20.345
I'm watching that antique show.
Do you have it on?

32:20.378 --> 32:21.847
Uh, yeah. You can...
Why don't you go to sleep

32:21.879 --> 32:23.281
and we can just talk
tomorrow or some...

32:23.315 --> 32:25.217
Are you in bed, all cozy?

32:25.250 --> 32:27.185
Put that wool pillow
under your knees.

32:27.219 --> 32:29.421
I'm using mine.
It's so nice.

32:29.453 --> 32:31.723
You have something
nice and crunchy to eat?

32:31.757 --> 32:34.493
I can't see
your face very well.

32:34.526 --> 32:36.595
- It's so dark.
- The light's broken.

32:36.627 --> 32:39.298
Oh. Mm. All right.

32:39.330 --> 32:40.799
I'm ordering you
a stick-on light,

32:40.831 --> 32:43.368
like the one in your old room.

32:43.402 --> 32:44.569
Okay, I know.

32:44.603 --> 32:45.938
Just which one?

32:45.971 --> 32:47.373
What time is it there?

32:47.405 --> 32:49.207
Our schedules are
so out of sync.

32:49.241 --> 32:51.443
I know you'll feel better
when we're aligned back,

32:51.475 --> 32:52.844
but that's impossible now.

32:52.877 --> 32:55.580
- Yeah, and I...
- Okay, so it'll come Tues...

32:55.614 --> 32:58.417
No. Yes. Tuesday. Uh-huh.

32:58.450 --> 33:00.586
Did you get the case
of iced tea? Mm.

33:00.618 --> 33:02.954
I saw something this morning
that made me think of you.

33:02.988 --> 33:05.191
This is gonna make you
so happy.

33:05.223 --> 33:08.426
Type in
"Vemo infusion pitcher."

33:08.460 --> 33:12.631
Look on the bottom picture,
and then zoom in, zoom in,

33:12.664 --> 33:15.800
zoom back to... Oh!

33:15.834 --> 33:18.971
This guy's old rocking chair...
it's worth a half a million.

33:19.003 --> 33:20.872
I had no idea. No.

33:20.905 --> 33:23.309
He's so surprised. He had no...

33:25.777 --> 33:30.282
I have a heist we can do,
to get the 1,500.

33:30.315 --> 33:33.385
Okay, I'm just gonna start,
I'm gonna start talking. Okay.

33:34.786 --> 33:37.356
So, I'm, um... I'm not
a physician's assistant.

33:37.388 --> 33:40.225
That was, um... I don't even
know why I said that. Anyway...

33:40.259 --> 33:42.361
I work at Abram's Optics
in the Galleria,

33:42.394 --> 33:44.363
which, if you don't know,
is the worst branch there is.

33:44.396 --> 33:45.931
Honestly, I'm wasting
my life there.

33:45.963 --> 33:49.234
I just sell bifocals
to agro old people all day.

33:49.268 --> 33:52.738
Mean but, like, also super
lonely and desperate, you know?

33:52.771 --> 33:55.374
Like, I've been invited
to Easters and to Mahjong

33:55.406 --> 33:56.774
and to look at scrapbooks and...

33:56.808 --> 33:58.911
You know, I don't go because
it's gross, but if I did,

33:58.944 --> 34:01.981
I bet you that I would find
mad antiques.

34:03.281 --> 34:04.617
- Huh.
- Yeah.

34:04.649 --> 34:06.351
I mean, not super fancy ones,

34:06.385 --> 34:09.321
but I have a feeling that
if I said I liked something,

34:09.353 --> 34:11.556
they would give it to me
for free or cheap,

34:11.589 --> 34:14.893
and then we can sell it
and turn a tidy profit.

34:16.694 --> 34:18.362
Boom!

34:18.397 --> 34:21.533
Who do we sell the antiques to?

34:21.565 --> 34:23.702
We can...

34:23.734 --> 34:26.603
we can get a stall
at the flea market.

34:26.638 --> 34:28.906
I love the flea market.
It is so indie.

34:28.938 --> 34:31.643
That is a great idea.

34:31.676 --> 34:33.478
It's just tremendous.

34:33.511 --> 34:34.978
Right?

34:35.013 --> 34:36.748
Three-way split.

34:36.781 --> 34:38.783
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.784
No problem.

34:40.818 --> 34:43.054
It's like an internship.

34:43.088 --> 34:44.322
I'm Melanie.

34:44.356 --> 34:45.857
All right, okay.

34:45.889 --> 34:47.859
Uh, Melanie, meet Old Dolio.

34:47.891 --> 34:49.427
Old... what?

34:49.460 --> 34:50.995
Dolio.

34:51.027 --> 34:52.563
Old Dolio.

34:52.597 --> 34:53.864
Okay.

34:53.899 --> 34:55.768
I like that.
I like that.

34:55.801 --> 34:57.903
See, this is
exactly the kind of thing

34:57.935 --> 34:58.870
that I've been wanting...

34:59.970 --> 35:01.906
- Don't touch!
- Ah!

35:01.939 --> 35:03.374
Don't touch the table.

35:03.408 --> 35:04.943
I've been through tremors
a lot smaller than this.

35:04.975 --> 35:08.079
It just turns everything
electric, like zap.

35:08.113 --> 35:10.049
'Cause this is the way
the big one starts.

35:10.082 --> 35:11.784
With the noise, it just keeps

35:11.816 --> 35:13.484
building and building
and building.

35:13.517 --> 35:15.320
But this one's not building.

35:15.354 --> 35:17.323
The big one will be loud.

35:17.356 --> 35:19.558
I mean, if you're lucky,
you'll get crushed.

35:19.591 --> 35:22.060
And then you'll... you just die
right then and there.

35:22.093 --> 35:24.095
Immediately.

35:24.129 --> 35:26.665
- A never-ending void.
- Wow.

35:26.698 --> 35:28.500
So, YOLO.

35:28.533 --> 35:31.036
Am I right?

35:31.068 --> 35:34.105
They are
real characters, super unique.

35:34.138 --> 35:35.740
But you vouch for them, right?

35:35.774 --> 35:37.009
Vouch?

35:37.042 --> 35:38.844
I just mean on, like,
a level of basic safety.

35:38.877 --> 35:40.412
I had a friend
who did stripping,

35:40.444 --> 35:41.613
and I would never do that,

35:41.646 --> 35:43.481
but this feels like
a little more...

35:43.515 --> 35:44.650
Okay. You know,
if I'm being honest,

35:44.682 --> 35:46.718
my favorite movies are
the <i>Ocean Eleven</i> movies.

35:46.752 --> 35:48.387
And I just am pretty psyched

35:48.419 --> 35:50.822
about being on, like,
an actual heist.

35:53.024 --> 35:55.861
How did you meet them?

35:55.894 --> 35:58.397
They're my parents.

36:10.975 --> 36:12.611
- Oh.
- Hey, hey.

36:12.644 --> 36:14.812
That's an interesting blouse.

36:14.845 --> 36:15.947
Thank you.

36:15.981 --> 36:17.616
You know, it was
actually a-a dress.

36:17.649 --> 36:19.352
And then I just...

36:21.685 --> 36:23.856
I like your tr-tracksuit.

36:36.501 --> 36:39.138
Sue! You look so great!

36:39.171 --> 36:40.873
Here we are.

36:40.906 --> 36:42.908
This is m-my family.

36:46.745 --> 36:49.114
I love these, Sue.

36:49.147 --> 36:50.115
Aren't they great?

36:50.147 --> 36:52.017
My husband gave them to me.

36:52.050 --> 36:54.419
He got them in England.

36:54.452 --> 36:57.054
My ancestors were British
on both sides.

36:57.088 --> 36:59.758
I think the people are
more civilized there.

36:59.790 --> 37:02.160
- 4:00 tea and all that.
- This is great.

37:02.193 --> 37:03.694
Sue.

37:03.727 --> 37:06.030
- I love this dog.
- Oh.

37:12.102 --> 37:13.604
Blimey!

37:13.638 --> 37:15.174
I've made a wretched mess,
I'm afraid.

37:15.207 --> 37:17.142
Oh, that's all right, Mum.

37:17.175 --> 37:18.743
No bother, really.

37:18.776 --> 37:23.548
I-I didn't realize at first
that you were...

37:23.582 --> 37:25.150
But you're not British.

37:25.182 --> 37:27.518
No.

37:27.551 --> 37:28.921
No. You're too dark.

37:28.953 --> 37:31.622
There are dark people
everywhere.

37:31.656 --> 37:33.058
I know.

37:33.091 --> 37:35.560
I just meant what you think of
when you imagine a...

37:37.229 --> 37:39.631
She's adopted. Yeah.

37:39.664 --> 37:42.533
We always say we were given one
and we chose one.

37:42.566 --> 37:43.801
Oh.

37:43.834 --> 37:48.005
That's just how I feel
about my Doodlebug.

37:48.039 --> 37:50.075
- Come here, baby. Yeah.
- Doodlebug.

37:50.107 --> 37:51.577
That's a beautiful name.

37:51.609 --> 37:52.711
- Is that...
- It's French.

37:52.743 --> 37:53.946
Mm.

37:58.283 --> 37:59.918
650?

37:59.950 --> 38:02.053
- We need 1,500.
- We don't want to push it.

38:02.086 --> 38:05.590
Deposits over 700
trigger a bank review,

38:05.624 --> 38:07.024
so we'll do this
a few more times.

38:07.057 --> 38:08.926
Well, two more by Friday.

38:08.959 --> 38:09.961
- Yeah.
- What?

38:09.995 --> 38:11.163
No.

38:11.196 --> 38:12.931
No, this is... If we get caught,

38:12.964 --> 38:15.034
it-it'll be much worse for me
because I'm Puerto Rican.

38:20.171 --> 38:21.772
Isn't that amazing?

38:21.805 --> 38:24.943
Old Dolio learned to forge
before she learned to write.

38:24.975 --> 38:26.944
Well, actually, that's how
she did learn to write.

38:26.977 --> 38:28.981
What about my plan?
I mean, was that just...

38:29.013 --> 38:33.017
Your plan to cash in on the
generosity of lonely people?

38:36.120 --> 38:38.122
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:38.156 --> 38:39.892
Ow!

38:39.925 --> 38:41.292
You knocked off my nail.

38:41.325 --> 38:43.528
I... I mean, what am I...

38:43.562 --> 38:44.730
I'm gonna have to
take them all off now,

38:44.763 --> 38:45.898
because I'm gonna look like
a crazy person

38:45.930 --> 38:47.098
with just, like,
one nail missing.

38:48.934 --> 38:50.935
What are you...?

38:52.336 --> 38:54.539
Oh, okay. I can...

39:23.133 --> 39:27.138
You need, like, special
nail polish remover for that.

40:06.176 --> 40:07.879
<i>Oh, uh, yep, yep, yep, yep.</i>

40:07.912 --> 40:09.881
This is a very liquid
and high-yield deal.

40:09.914 --> 40:11.749
- That's right. It's a nice design.
- Um...

40:11.783 --> 40:12.918
I mean, I hadn't noticed.

40:12.950 --> 40:14.719
- It's kind of chic.
- Actually...

40:16.955 --> 40:18.924
I think we should give that
to Stovik right now

40:18.957 --> 40:20.725
- and tell him the rest is coming.
- Howdy-do.

40:20.758 --> 40:22.694
Howdy-do. Howdy-do.

40:24.095 --> 40:25.062
Howdy-do.

40:25.095 --> 40:27.698
Look at this guy.

40:27.731 --> 40:29.800
Look at...

40:29.834 --> 40:31.036
Oh.

40:31.068 --> 40:32.703
I feel like a senator.

40:32.736 --> 40:35.906
Ah. I love hot tubs.

40:37.975 --> 40:39.343
What color is your bathroom?

40:39.377 --> 40:40.912
Do you think this one
will match?

40:40.944 --> 40:42.747
This, like,
smoky, coraly thing?

40:42.781 --> 40:45.417
Stop it.
You can just slide right in.

40:45.450 --> 40:46.984
Come on in, Old Dolio.

40:47.017 --> 40:49.286
I don't think
you're supposed to get in that.

40:49.319 --> 40:50.821
Sure, you can.

40:50.854 --> 40:52.023
It's a dry test.

40:52.057 --> 40:53.892
Get on in there.

40:53.925 --> 40:55.193
Yeah. Just make
yourselves comfy.

40:55.225 --> 40:57.229
Here, let me,
let me help you out.

40:57.261 --> 40:59.731
- Uh, I... I can do it. I can...
- Oops.

40:59.763 --> 41:01.165
Yeah. Yeah.

41:01.198 --> 41:02.267
Get yourselves comfortable.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.403
Grab a seat.
Plenty to choose from.

41:04.435 --> 41:06.203
Yep.

41:06.236 --> 41:07.673
Uh...

41:07.705 --> 41:10.876
Okay, now,
I want you guys to imagine

41:10.908 --> 41:13.711
hot water right up to here.

41:13.745 --> 41:16.114
Okay?
I'll get in there with you.

41:16.147 --> 41:18.016
Hey.

41:18.048 --> 41:19.184
Yep. Sorry.

41:19.216 --> 41:23.287
47 adjustable massaging heads

41:23.321 --> 41:25.357
with targeted
neck and shoulder jets.

41:25.390 --> 41:30.261
A cascading waterfall, uh,
creating a soothing ambience.

41:30.294 --> 41:31.762
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

41:31.796 --> 41:33.765
Uh, there's an ambiance.

41:33.798 --> 41:35.767
Should I go on or...?

41:35.800 --> 41:36.935
She's sold, right?

41:38.035 --> 41:39.771
How much is it?

41:39.803 --> 41:41.839
9,499. Okay?

41:41.872 --> 41:45.743
Just $150 down and $99 a month,

41:45.776 --> 41:48.412
with, uh, 29% APR financing.

41:48.446 --> 41:51.982
So, you... w-we pay $150,
we can walk away with it?

41:52.015 --> 41:53.251
Yeah.

41:53.283 --> 41:54.885
Well, not this exact one.

41:54.919 --> 41:56.421
It has to ship
from the warehouse.

41:56.453 --> 41:58.756
But by the end of the day
tomorrow.

42:02.093 --> 42:04.430
That's 150.

42:06.064 --> 42:09.234
Um, so if I'm not happy, uh,

42:09.267 --> 42:12.771
I can return it at any point
and get a full refund?

42:12.803 --> 42:15.240
Well, once it's installed,
you can't...

42:15.272 --> 42:17.975
Oh, ins... yeah. Yeah, yeah.
In-Installed, of course.

42:18.008 --> 42:19.944
But if it hasn't
been installed?

42:19.977 --> 42:21.780
Then sure. Yeah.

42:21.812 --> 42:24.348
- You know, like, if it doesn't fit or if the color's off.
- Ah.

42:24.381 --> 42:27.752
And, now, um,
the cladding is extra.

42:27.785 --> 42:29.287
I have a suggestion for you.

42:31.856 --> 42:33.325
What?

42:34.892 --> 42:36.528
Wear more clothes.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.396
You're making everybody
feel uncomfortable.

42:38.428 --> 42:40.432
I'll get a full refund?

42:45.435 --> 42:47.905
Okay, we got to be in and out

42:47.939 --> 42:50.008
so we can catch the leak
by 5:00.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.910
Okay.
Honestly, I'm kind of excited

42:51.943 --> 42:54.245
because this guy
is such a creep.

42:54.278 --> 42:55.479
So, his name is Abe.

42:55.513 --> 42:57.448
Oh, God, this feels
like <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

42:57.481 --> 42:59.884
Okay. Okay, so he's
what we call a no-show.

42:59.917 --> 43:01.019
He didn't pick up his glasses,

43:01.051 --> 43:02.521
so I had to give him
a reminder call,

43:02.553 --> 43:05.055
and when I did, he asked
if I can come and deliver,

43:05.089 --> 43:06.958
which I said
normally we wouldn't do that.

43:06.990 --> 43:09.326
But when I told him
that I was bringing my family,

43:09.359 --> 43:11.028
he, like, was crying.

43:11.062 --> 43:12.964
Like, so desperate. It was...

43:16.434 --> 43:18.169
It's open.

43:20.205 --> 43:22.374
So I just...
I just, um... Okay.

43:38.156 --> 43:39.491
Hi.

43:42.227 --> 43:44.830
I'm not feeling well,

43:44.863 --> 43:49.067
but, please,
make-make yourself at home.

44:15.093 --> 44:16.928
That's it.

44:16.961 --> 44:20.999
Just be how you are at home.

44:21.031 --> 44:24.102
Just a normal day
around the house.

44:27.138 --> 44:29.540
I think he's just lonely.

44:29.573 --> 44:32.109
Oh, he's pretending.
He wants us to...

44:32.142 --> 44:34.111
Right, like we're his family.

44:45.055 --> 44:46.490
He's only

44:46.524 --> 44:48.526
two strokes back right now,
and the only thing...

44:48.559 --> 44:50.528
Good. That's good.

44:50.560 --> 44:53.298
M-My son used to watch that.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.570
Oh, Robert,
always with the sports.

44:59.604 --> 45:02.506
Why don't you
mow the lawn for once?

45:02.539 --> 45:04.475
Nice.

45:04.508 --> 45:06.244
Do more like that.

45:08.578 --> 45:10.548
How was school, hon?

45:14.118 --> 45:16.354
School was fine.

45:16.386 --> 45:18.289
How was your day?

45:18.323 --> 45:20.359
A little louder, please.

45:23.394 --> 45:25.430
How was your day?

45:26.731 --> 45:28.934
What did you do today, Mom?

45:31.468 --> 45:34.438
That's nice...
to be asked that.

45:34.472 --> 45:36.374
You really want to know?

45:40.243 --> 45:41.579
Huh.

45:43.414 --> 45:44.482
Wasn't easy.

45:44.515 --> 45:46.251
None of my days are easy.

45:47.318 --> 45:50.222
Why? What happened?

45:55.193 --> 45:57.162
The refrigerator broke.

45:59.497 --> 46:00.565
It's not in there.

46:00.597 --> 46:03.200
- So, uh...
- Not that drawer. Try the other drawer.

46:05.102 --> 46:08.238
You must be
the refrigerator repair person.

46:08.272 --> 46:09.474
Okay.

46:12.676 --> 46:14.611
I bet you meet
a lot of lonely women

46:14.644 --> 46:16.414
when you're out in the field.

46:17.481 --> 46:19.450
Repairing refrigerators.

46:24.055 --> 46:27.359
Housewives must be throwing
themselves at you, huh?

46:29.060 --> 46:30.529
'Cause, uh...

46:32.629 --> 46:35.232
You know, if you need tools,
we have tools.

46:35.265 --> 46:38.470
Uh, I'm just here to do a job.

46:44.175 --> 46:46.544
Hey. Checkbook is not here.

46:46.577 --> 46:48.479
Check his bedroom.

46:48.513 --> 46:50.048
Come on.

46:57.187 --> 46:59.223
This is hard.

47:05.229 --> 47:11.236
It's like trying
to fall asleep forever.

47:28.519 --> 47:30.287
It sounds good.

47:30.321 --> 47:34.626
Maybe some silverware clinking.

47:34.658 --> 47:36.694
Or play the piano.

47:46.236 --> 47:48.539
I think it's in there,
but we have to wait.

47:48.573 --> 47:49.674
It's 4:15.

47:49.707 --> 47:51.509
We'll miss the leak.

47:51.542 --> 47:54.546
He's trying to...

47:56.481 --> 47:58.783
...die.

47:58.816 --> 48:02.352
But we should,
we should keep on, um...

48:02.385 --> 48:07.425
He said he wants piano playing
and s-silverware clinking.

48:46.597 --> 48:49.600
How was school, hon?

48:49.633 --> 48:51.301
It was fine.

48:51.334 --> 48:52.703
But I'm starving.

48:52.736 --> 48:54.571
M-Me, too.

48:54.604 --> 48:56.807
Would you like
some leftover cake?

48:56.841 --> 48:58.543
Okay.

49:15.959 --> 49:17.628
Oh!

49:17.662 --> 49:20.765
- He just scored?
- Oh, he scored a-a one-holer.

49:26.336 --> 49:27.938
Do you think
I could have some of that?

49:27.972 --> 49:29.374
Would you like some milk?

49:29.406 --> 49:31.408
Please.

49:40.685 --> 49:42.320
Thank you. Thank you.

49:42.352 --> 49:44.255
You're welcome.

49:55.432 --> 49:57.868
You know, I think I will
mow the lawn tomorrow.

49:57.901 --> 49:59.670
You said that last weekend.

49:59.703 --> 50:00.805
Did I?

50:08.312 --> 50:09.681
Maybe I'll mow the lawn.

50:10.714 --> 50:14.852
I'll just go into the garage
and get it out.

50:25.328 --> 50:26.664
Okay.

50:27.664 --> 50:29.300
Go check.

50:29.332 --> 50:30.401
Go.

51:02.867 --> 51:05.537
Am I still here?

51:10.774 --> 51:12.477
Yeah.

51:16.580 --> 51:20.585
You see how there's light?

51:20.618 --> 51:25.556
You'll know because
it'll be dark all around and...

51:25.589 --> 51:27.325
quiet.

51:29.859 --> 51:32.530
Please...

51:32.562 --> 51:35.867
don't do anything to the house.

51:37.600 --> 51:40.604
My kids have plans for it.

51:42.839 --> 51:44.843
They're not bad kids.

51:46.843 --> 51:49.013
Just busy.

52:24.481 --> 52:27.050
Life is...

52:27.084 --> 52:28.620
nothing.

52:31.821 --> 52:34.858
Just let it go without
really thinking about it.

52:37.528 --> 52:41.832
Like you're
letting go of a...

52:41.865 --> 52:43.867
piece of string.

52:45.002 --> 52:47.539
Just let it...

52:51.709 --> 52:54.044
It's not that big of a deal.

53:25.642 --> 53:27.744
Oh, no.

53:27.778 --> 53:29.480
Oh, my God.

53:29.513 --> 53:31.482
What's wrong?

53:31.515 --> 53:33.718
What's wrong? This...

53:33.751 --> 53:35.653
Oh.

53:35.685 --> 53:36.687
No, I-I mean...

53:36.720 --> 53:38.890
She has tender feelings.

53:38.923 --> 53:41.125
You wouldn't know
anything about that.

53:41.158 --> 53:42.493
I know.

53:42.526 --> 53:43.728
Oh, there's no checkbook.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.662
You're sad is what you are.

53:45.696 --> 53:46.898
Huh?

53:46.930 --> 53:48.165
I'm not gonna do this again.

53:48.198 --> 53:51.601
And-and I don't think that we
should take anything from him.

53:51.635 --> 53:52.903
Okay, okay. So here we are.

53:52.937 --> 53:54.472
Oh, I don't know.

53:54.504 --> 53:55.906
Somewhere there's a checkbook
in this house,

53:55.939 --> 53:58.041
and, uh, when we find it,
we're just gonna...

53:58.075 --> 54:01.446
we're gonna cash out the whole
$850 and be done with it,

54:01.479 --> 54:03.881
because, quite frankly,
I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

54:03.914 --> 54:06.050
I've been put in an
uncomfortable position, so...

54:08.218 --> 54:09.986
Go run the buckets.

54:10.019 --> 54:12.689
You can still make it
if you take the 53, huh?

54:12.722 --> 54:14.991
Come on, hurry. Hurry.

54:15.024 --> 54:17.194
Oh, my...

54:17.227 --> 54:19.629
So, I know. Okay.
No, no. You sit down.

54:19.662 --> 54:22.732
S-Sit down, and you have
a glass of water and...

55:42.078 --> 55:43.914
And your son is how old?

55:43.948 --> 55:44.982
Three.

55:45.015 --> 55:46.017
And his name is?

55:46.050 --> 55:47.551
Cyrus. Cy.

55:47.584 --> 55:49.086
Okay.

55:50.321 --> 55:52.290
Hi, Cy.

55:54.658 --> 55:57.194
I mean, he would, too, uh,
especially with new people.

55:57.227 --> 55:58.863
I mean, he just goes ballistic.

55:58.896 --> 55:59.964
- It's...
- Okay.

55:59.997 --> 56:00.964
Okay, that's good.

56:00.997 --> 56:02.332
So, we know now that we have

56:02.365 --> 56:04.167
a three-year-old
that tends to hit.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.102
Okay. That's not abnormal.

56:06.135 --> 56:09.172
So, first, I'll just observe.

56:09.205 --> 56:11.142
Okay? All right.

56:15.812 --> 56:18.582
Are you... hungry?

56:18.615 --> 56:20.818
Mm, no.

56:20.850 --> 56:24.588
Are you tired?

56:24.622 --> 56:26.790
Mm... no.

56:29.359 --> 56:31.361
You look excited, Cy.

56:31.394 --> 56:33.797
Are you excited
to see the other children?

56:33.830 --> 56:36.133
- Do you just need some of their attention?
- Yeah.

56:36.165 --> 56:37.801
Yeah! Okay.

56:37.834 --> 56:39.903
And sometimes that's enough.

56:39.937 --> 56:42.139
Just verbalizing the need
is enough.

56:42.171 --> 56:43.974
A three-year-old
that wants attention...

56:44.008 --> 56:45.176
not unreasonable, right?

56:54.251 --> 56:56.254
Old Dolio.

57:01.892 --> 57:05.897
You should...
well, if you want to.

57:08.999 --> 57:11.202
She might do one more.

57:11.234 --> 57:12.769
No.

57:18.075 --> 57:20.845
How about we do it together?

57:29.720 --> 57:31.689
Maybe you get
the party started.

57:38.028 --> 57:42.033
I'll just go,
uh, check the-the front.

57:43.300 --> 57:44.836
Okay.

57:48.037 --> 57:49.740
I don't think
Old Dolio likes me.

57:49.772 --> 57:54.678
Oh. No, she-she,
she doesn't like anyone.

57:54.711 --> 57:56.213
She's not like that.

57:57.314 --> 58:00.850
And your daughter's name is?

58:00.883 --> 58:02.185
Old Dolio.

58:02.218 --> 58:03.753
Uh, Old...?

58:03.787 --> 58:06.957
Dolio. We named her
after a homeless guy

58:06.990 --> 58:10.227
who won the lottery, hoping
he'd put her in his will.

58:10.260 --> 58:13.997
But Old Dolio...
the old Old Dolio...

58:14.031 --> 58:15.966
used up all his money
at the very end

58:15.999 --> 58:19.303
on experimental cancer stuff.

58:19.336 --> 58:22.205
Mm. Okay.

58:23.807 --> 58:26.276
And your daughter is...?

58:32.783 --> 58:36.453
She doesn't know anything
about tender feelings.

58:41.057 --> 58:43.326
Hi, Old Dolio.

58:46.863 --> 58:49.032
Okay, so I'm just
gonna observe.

58:50.334 --> 58:51.703
Hmm.

58:53.870 --> 58:57.040
Are you feeling stressed?

58:58.876 --> 59:00.511
Hmm, no. No.

59:00.544 --> 59:02.246
Okay.

59:04.515 --> 59:07.318
Do you want to hold my hand?

59:07.350 --> 59:09.086
No? Okay.

59:09.118 --> 59:11.021
Okay. Hmm.

59:13.189 --> 59:15.091
Your hair has gotten so long.

59:15.124 --> 59:18.094
It's beautiful, hon.

59:18.127 --> 59:20.930
Can I brush it?

59:44.086 --> 59:45.522
It's just a tremor. It's okay.

59:45.555 --> 59:47.258
You're... It's okay.

59:47.290 --> 59:49.794
You're okay with me.

01:00:01.537 --> 01:00:04.140
Here, let's, uh, warm it up
a little bit.

01:00:04.173 --> 01:00:05.842
Is there...?

01:00:05.876 --> 01:00:07.944
Oh, uh, there's a drain.

01:00:07.977 --> 01:00:09.847
It can drain.
There's a drain under there.

01:00:09.879 --> 01:00:11.915
On the floor. In the floor.

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:17.187
So are you gonna return it
or sell it and then return it?

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.588
Or what do you want?

01:00:18.622 --> 01:00:21.125
It's better with the light off.

01:00:38.341 --> 01:00:40.310
Let's take a bath.

01:00:45.481 --> 01:00:47.450
Are you surprised?

01:00:49.051 --> 01:00:51.321
Maybe you didn't know
that I-I felt this way.

01:00:51.354 --> 01:00:53.223
No.

01:00:53.256 --> 01:00:55.959
I'm the least surprised
I've ever been in my life.

01:00:55.993 --> 01:00:57.328
Huh.

01:00:59.363 --> 01:01:02.031
So what's the plan?

01:01:02.064 --> 01:01:03.934
You'll watch me undress,
and then you'll start

01:01:03.966 --> 01:01:06.604
getting your dick hard,
then I'll get in?

01:01:10.374 --> 01:01:12.142
Well?

01:01:12.175 --> 01:01:14.010
Come on.

01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:22.151
So, what were you picturing?

01:01:22.185 --> 01:01:24.088
- Soapy titties?
- Sure.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.122
Yeah? Sure.

01:01:28.225 --> 01:01:29.493
Does this work?

01:01:29.526 --> 01:01:31.462
No, right?
Of course it doesn't work.

01:01:31.495 --> 01:01:32.630
Why would it work?

01:01:32.662 --> 01:01:34.430
Nothing works here.

01:01:34.464 --> 01:01:36.033
Pathetic.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.203
So, titty fuck?

01:01:40.236 --> 01:01:42.405
- Oh, that got your attention.
- Knock, knock.

01:01:44.374 --> 01:01:47.310
Oh.

01:01:47.343 --> 01:01:49.679
We want this to be
about your pleasure, too.

01:01:49.713 --> 01:01:51.015
Oh, yeah.

01:01:51.048 --> 01:01:53.517
Well, what makes you feel good?

01:01:57.254 --> 01:01:59.522
- Uh, Melanie, uh, let's not...
- Listen, uh...

01:01:59.555 --> 01:02:01.391
- Just... let's just...
- We-We're, we're surprised.

01:02:01.425 --> 01:02:03.227
- Time for a snack, all right?
- I think, I think...

01:02:18.008 --> 01:02:19.910
- What?
- What?

01:02:22.078 --> 01:02:23.948
What are you guys doing?

01:02:27.283 --> 01:02:30.453
Why-why are there crackers
on a plate?

01:02:32.455 --> 01:02:34.057
Don't go, hon.

01:02:35.392 --> 01:02:37.261
"Hon"?

01:02:41.164 --> 01:02:43.267
You just...

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.968
You've never called me that.

01:02:45.002 --> 01:02:46.637
I have.

01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:48.539
I have called you that.

01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:50.039
Oh?

01:02:50.073 --> 01:02:52.143
Call me "hon," then.

01:02:53.176 --> 01:02:54.645
What is that? Hmm?

01:02:54.678 --> 01:02:57.348
What is this?
"Newborn to 18 years."

01:02:57.381 --> 01:02:59.550
You can't do it.

01:02:59.582 --> 01:03:02.285
I bet you could if it was
a job, though, right?

01:03:12.629 --> 01:03:16.600
$1,575 to call me "hon."

01:03:16.633 --> 01:03:19.136
Oh, three-way split.

01:03:19.169 --> 01:03:21.205
It's 525 each.

01:03:23.272 --> 01:03:26.276
I don't want to do it
that way this time.

01:03:34.151 --> 01:03:36.319
It's one word. Just say it.

01:03:38.321 --> 01:03:39.757
You could just say it.

01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:45.495
I can't just say it.

01:03:45.528 --> 01:03:50.099
We... don't call you "hon"

01:03:50.133 --> 01:03:52.435
or "sweetheart" or "baby."

01:03:52.468 --> 01:03:57.273
We don't wrap up little
birthday presents with ribbons.

01:03:57.307 --> 01:03:59.309
- I-I don't want...
- Yes.

01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:01.677
That's what you want.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.548
And-and what else? Hmm?

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.051
Want me to put you
on my abdomen?

01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:09.285
Hmm?

01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:12.356
Make pancakes?

01:04:12.388 --> 01:04:14.490
And you want me to do a little dance?

01:04:14.524 --> 01:04:16.460
- No.
- Yes.

01:04:16.493 --> 01:04:21.632
You want us to be
false, fakey people.

01:04:21.664 --> 01:04:22.665
Hmm?

01:04:30.272 --> 01:04:32.209
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

01:04:32.242 --> 01:04:33.444
I'll do it.

01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:40.184
I'll call you "hon" for $1,575.

01:04:47.857 --> 01:04:49.459
Keep walking.

01:04:49.493 --> 01:04:51.462
Keep walking. Keep walking.

01:05:12.281 --> 01:05:13.751
A lot of stuff.

01:05:14.783 --> 01:05:17.653
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:28.865 --> 01:05:30.234
What's this?

01:05:30.267 --> 01:05:34.370
Uh, it's a...
it's a mug warmer.

01:05:34.403 --> 01:05:36.739
A lot of the times, my mom
will buy two of something

01:05:36.772 --> 01:05:38.441
and just send me one.

01:05:57.493 --> 01:05:58.861
It's Wednesday.

01:05:58.894 --> 01:06:02.565
Wednesday it leaks three times
'cause of sanitation.

01:06:02.598 --> 01:06:06.336
It's... it's really
a three-person job.

01:06:08.738 --> 01:06:10.674
It's all over the floor now.

01:06:10.707 --> 01:06:12.743
They'll be calling any second.

01:06:17.613 --> 01:06:19.649
Just after they put
the buckets down.

01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:36.232
Okay, uh...

01:06:36.265 --> 01:06:38.868
thank you or whatever.

01:06:38.901 --> 01:06:40.870
Um, here.

01:06:40.903 --> 01:06:42.838
This should cover that.

01:06:42.872 --> 01:06:45.676
Unless you bought it in bulk...
I don't know.

01:06:45.709 --> 01:06:47.511
Y-You don't pay for...

01:06:50.446 --> 01:06:51.881
Okay.

01:06:51.914 --> 01:06:53.416
Uh...

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:54.885
You're jonesing.

01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:56.986
What?

01:06:57.019 --> 01:07:00.290
You're addicted to them.

01:07:01.323 --> 01:07:02.693
My cousin Timothy...

01:07:02.725 --> 01:07:04.794
when he was trying to
kick pills, he would be fine,

01:07:04.827 --> 01:07:06.530
and then he would have
this sudden wave

01:07:06.562 --> 01:07:08.365
of needing them really bad.

01:07:11.568 --> 01:07:14.004
Well, I think
this is a little different

01:07:14.037 --> 01:07:15.739
because they're my parents.

01:07:15.772 --> 01:07:17.641
In what sense?

01:07:17.673 --> 01:07:20.243
What?

01:07:20.276 --> 01:07:22.713
In what sense
are they your parents?

01:07:22.745 --> 01:07:25.281
What's an example?

01:07:29.685 --> 01:07:32.289
We split everything three ways.

01:07:32.321 --> 01:07:33.856
We have since I was little.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.426
What do you spend yours on?

01:07:37.493 --> 01:07:39.363
Your third.

01:07:39.396 --> 01:07:42.899
W-We go in
on everything equally.

01:07:42.932 --> 01:07:46.803
Actually,
that's another example.

01:07:46.836 --> 01:07:48.872
That makes two things.

01:07:55.345 --> 01:07:56.847
Aren't you
forgetting something?

01:08:04.453 --> 01:08:06.390
Hon.

01:08:06.423 --> 01:08:07.691
Oh, hon.

01:08:11.593 --> 01:08:13.997
My sweetheart.

01:08:15.097 --> 01:08:17.399
My sweet baby.

01:08:26.642 --> 01:08:29.511
There's a check cashing place
across the street.

01:08:47.363 --> 01:08:49.832
Oh, so you're just gonna go...?

01:08:49.865 --> 01:08:51.868
Home.

01:08:55.636 --> 01:08:56.906
W-Wait.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:59.977
You thought I was gonna
take this much for...?

01:09:01.676 --> 01:09:03.712
This is a full-service deal.

01:09:05.448 --> 01:09:08.618
Uh... so...

01:09:09.752 --> 01:09:12.456
"We don't call you 'hon, '

01:09:12.488 --> 01:09:16.359
'sweetheart' or 'baby.'"

01:09:16.392 --> 01:09:17.560
Did that.

01:09:18.993 --> 01:09:21.964
"We don't make..."

01:09:21.997 --> 01:09:23.367
Pancakes?

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:24.734
We don't have to...

01:09:24.767 --> 01:09:26.035
You can just take it.

01:09:26.069 --> 01:09:28.437
What was that thing
that she said

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.040
about putting you
on her abdomen?

01:09:30.073 --> 01:09:31.742
Oh, it's-it's called
a breast crawl.

01:09:31.774 --> 01:09:33.877
It's not...

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:36.479
Uh, do a little dance?

01:09:36.511 --> 01:09:38.147
I don't know why she said that.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.384
Have you ever danced?

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:42.453
Yeah.

01:09:45.187 --> 01:09:46.654
Birthdays?

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:48.158
Birthday presents
wrapped up with a bow.

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:50.158
Look, let's not.

01:09:50.193 --> 01:09:52.395
So when we've done
these things,

01:09:52.428 --> 01:09:55.030
then I want my money
and you can go.

01:09:55.064 --> 01:09:58.735
I have to get pancake stuff
for the morning.

01:09:58.767 --> 01:09:59.903
The morning?

01:09:59.936 --> 01:10:01.671
They're a morning thing.

01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:11.647
There's a camera there,

01:10:11.681 --> 01:10:13.717
there and there.

01:10:15.185 --> 01:10:17.486
All Super A security systems
are on a pentagram,

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.723
so you have to move
between the points.

01:10:21.857 --> 01:10:25.395
Basically, all the odd-numbered
aisles are free goods.

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:30.401
I'm buying this stuff, so...

01:10:32.034 --> 01:10:33.903
Yeah.

01:10:33.936 --> 01:10:37.573
It's just an...
interesting fact.

01:10:50.787 --> 01:10:52.489
Is that okay?

01:10:54.524 --> 01:10:56.493
Oh. Do you want to...
I have pajamas.

01:10:56.525 --> 01:10:58.028
No. I'm good.

01:11:00.896 --> 01:11:02.966
What are you doing?

01:11:02.998 --> 01:11:05.202
What do you mean?

01:11:05.235 --> 01:11:07.103
What are...

01:11:07.136 --> 01:11:09.638
Are you trying to...

01:11:09.672 --> 01:11:11.141
rile me up?

01:11:26.021 --> 01:11:27.923
How does this even work?

01:11:27.957 --> 01:11:29.459
I can't...

01:11:57.553 --> 01:12:00.257
Here's what I would do:
just one big one.

01:12:00.289 --> 01:12:02.993
It's less flipping.

01:12:03.025 --> 01:12:06.028
Yeah, but l-little things are...
Like, it-it's fun.

01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:08.765
You just stack them.
Boop.

01:12:10.699 --> 01:12:13.936
Most happiness comes from,
like, dumb things.

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:15.271
Okay.

01:12:20.944 --> 01:12:23.613
Okay, uh, so...

01:12:23.645 --> 01:12:24.914
that's that.

01:12:24.948 --> 01:12:26.950
What's, uh... I don't...

01:12:28.784 --> 01:12:30.185
Oh, that.

01:12:30.218 --> 01:12:32.622
I could just crawl
out of a dark space to do that.

01:12:32.654 --> 01:12:33.989
That's fine.

01:12:34.022 --> 01:12:37.193
So, it'll be all dark,
and then I'll crawl out.

01:12:37.226 --> 01:12:39.162
The light will be blinding.

01:12:39.195 --> 01:12:41.898
And this is the abdomen.

01:12:41.931 --> 01:12:43.567
And then we're done.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.302
I know a place
that's darker than this.

01:12:45.334 --> 01:12:46.903
This is fine. It'll work.

01:12:46.936 --> 01:12:48.872
It's not gonna take long.

01:12:51.873 --> 01:12:54.109
Oh, we're right by the 7.

01:12:54.142 --> 01:12:57.113
You could just drop me
on the way back.

01:13:13.195 --> 01:13:15.598
This is the...

01:13:15.632 --> 01:13:16.900
Mm-hmm.

01:13:34.784 --> 01:13:37.154
Light's broken.

01:13:43.191 --> 01:13:46.229
Well, it's... it's dark, but...

01:13:46.262 --> 01:13:47.864
but this was so far.

01:13:47.896 --> 01:13:50.132
We could've been done by now.

01:13:50.165 --> 01:13:52.334
Exactly.

01:13:52.368 --> 01:13:56.338
Okay, so I guess
I'll crawl out and...

01:13:56.372 --> 01:13:58.341
It's just a tremor.

01:13:58.373 --> 01:14:00.309
No. This one is...

01:14:00.342 --> 01:14:01.877
This one is building.

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:03.346
- Whoa!
- It's happening!

01:14:03.378 --> 01:14:05.347
- Out. Get out.
- No! No, no, no, no.

01:14:05.381 --> 01:14:07.217
Don't touch the door
or the walls.

01:14:07.249 --> 01:14:09.653
Everything is live.
Just stay in the middle.

01:14:23.266 --> 01:14:25.135
- Is the doorknob...
- It's metal. It's live.

01:14:25.168 --> 01:14:27.371
Don't touch it. Don't touch.

01:14:31.373 --> 01:14:33.409
It's so quiet.

01:14:33.443 --> 01:14:36.046
I don't hear anyone.

01:14:36.079 --> 01:14:37.914
It is quiet.

01:14:37.946 --> 01:14:40.150
Why is it so quiet?

01:14:40.182 --> 01:14:41.184
It's darker.

01:14:41.217 --> 01:14:42.686
It was dark before.

01:14:42.718 --> 01:14:44.721
No, it's completely black.

01:14:46.355 --> 01:14:47.723
Oh, my God.

01:14:47.757 --> 01:14:49.259
What?

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.095
What?

01:14:52.128 --> 01:14:53.463
- Oh.
- What?

01:14:53.495 --> 01:14:55.731
You don't want to know.

01:14:58.167 --> 01:15:00.736
We're not in life anymore.

01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:02.004
- What?
- Yeah.

01:15:02.038 --> 01:15:03.839
I think it happened right away.

01:15:03.873 --> 01:15:05.208
Right after
that first big noise.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.342
- It?
- We died.

01:15:07.376 --> 01:15:09.846
Wh... I'm fine. I...

01:15:09.878 --> 01:15:11.814
That's what everyone
always says right after.

01:15:11.847 --> 01:15:13.149
They can't believe it.

01:15:13.182 --> 01:15:16.985
You might never believe it, but
this is just how it's gonna be.

01:15:17.019 --> 01:15:18.120
Forever.

01:15:18.154 --> 01:15:19.789
Just us.

01:15:19.821 --> 01:15:21.091
- In blackness.
- Stop. That's not...

01:15:21.123 --> 01:15:22.391
You can't believe it

01:15:22.425 --> 01:15:24.327
because you were
married to life.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.096
Hooked on it.

01:15:26.128 --> 01:15:28.731
I wasn't hooked, so it's not
such a big deal to me.

01:15:28.765 --> 01:15:30.734
- It would hurt.
- I don't think so.

01:15:30.766 --> 01:15:32.068
Please. Stop.

01:15:32.101 --> 01:15:33.336
I can feel my face.

01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:36.506
Yeah. That's just a memory.

01:15:47.784 --> 01:15:50.153
I don't have any regrets.

01:15:50.186 --> 01:15:52.021
You're gonna have
regrets, though,

01:15:52.053 --> 01:15:58.060
because you're gonna miss sex
and dancing and pancakes.

01:15:58.093 --> 01:16:02.030
I just had that one pancake,
so I'm not gonna be sad.

01:16:02.064 --> 01:16:03.900
You-you looked in the mirror
so many times

01:16:03.932 --> 01:16:05.135
you'll miss your face forever.

01:16:05.168 --> 01:16:06.903
But I-I don't even...

01:16:06.936 --> 01:16:08.404
I-I don't even
remember my face.

01:16:08.436 --> 01:16:10.439
I can't even say
what I looked like.

01:16:14.409 --> 01:16:16.178
You had long,
sandy blond hair...

01:16:16.212 --> 01:16:17.847
- Shh.
- ...ice blue eyes and...

01:16:17.879 --> 01:16:19.181
Stop. Shh.

01:16:19.214 --> 01:16:21.985
- Just doesn't matter.
- And pure skin.

01:16:22.017 --> 01:16:24.287
You know
I was just trying to rob you.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.789
No.

01:16:25.821 --> 01:16:27.156
You're such
a stupid little idiot,

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:29.225
and your brain is in your tits!

01:16:29.257 --> 01:16:32.095
The plan was for me
to go, and then...

01:16:32.128 --> 01:16:34.063
and-and stake out
your apartment

01:16:34.096 --> 01:16:36.232
and-and get access
to your account...

01:16:52.949 --> 01:16:54.984
You guys fine?

01:16:55.016 --> 01:16:56.285
Yeah. Are you?

01:16:56.319 --> 01:16:57.320
Yeah.

01:16:57.352 --> 01:17:00.088
I was, I was driving.

01:17:00.122 --> 01:17:01.557
Everyone stopped.
It was crazy.

01:17:01.591 --> 01:17:03.059
We thought we were dead.

01:17:03.092 --> 01:17:04.194
I didn't think that.

01:17:04.226 --> 01:17:05.561
I'm Old Dolio.

01:17:05.595 --> 01:17:07.329
It's wonderful to meet you.

01:17:07.363 --> 01:17:08.832
God bless you.

01:17:08.864 --> 01:17:10.899
Okay, I'm-I'm not religious,
but, uh...

01:17:10.932 --> 01:17:12.234
No, I'm-I'm not, either.

01:17:12.267 --> 01:17:14.169
I've never said that before
in my life.

01:17:14.203 --> 01:17:16.039
How about this?

01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:18.208
Right? You think
that was the big one?

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.609
Uh, I don't know.

01:17:19.641 --> 01:17:21.877
- I don't think that.
- No, it was.

01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:23.078
That was it.

01:17:23.111 --> 01:17:25.047
Thank you.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.915
- Thank you.
- Oh. Right.

01:17:26.949 --> 01:17:28.251
This is, this is done.

01:17:28.284 --> 01:17:31.487
Uh... I'm never
gonna forget you.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.390
My whole life.

01:17:34.422 --> 01:17:37.459
This... this Subaru.

01:17:40.029 --> 01:17:41.431
I've memorized all of this.

01:17:41.463 --> 01:17:42.931
Okay, can we...

01:17:53.676 --> 01:17:55.278
You guys okay?

01:17:55.311 --> 01:17:57.247
Yes. How are you?

01:17:57.279 --> 01:17:59.281
Oh, I'm fine.

01:17:59.315 --> 01:18:02.118
Yeah, these are
great structures for quakes.

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:05.053
Since we're open 24 hours, we
got to be ready for anything.

01:18:05.087 --> 01:18:07.022
Have you tried everything
in this store?

01:18:07.056 --> 01:18:08.191
Nope.

01:18:08.223 --> 01:18:10.293
That's what I would do
if I worked here.

01:18:10.325 --> 01:18:11.560
It's not too late.

01:18:11.593 --> 01:18:15.163
You can try everything once
and then isolate your favorites

01:18:15.196 --> 01:18:17.499
and-and just eat them
on a perfect day

01:18:17.533 --> 01:18:20.069
where you just eat
all your favorite foods.

01:18:20.101 --> 01:18:22.437
That's what I would do
if I worked here.

01:18:24.973 --> 01:18:26.441
So, do you apply?

01:18:26.475 --> 01:18:27.910
Or how does that work?

01:18:27.944 --> 01:18:29.611
Do you have to take
special training

01:18:29.645 --> 01:18:31.614
or-or a class or something?

01:18:39.555 --> 01:18:41.089
Yes! Yes!

01:18:41.123 --> 01:18:43.126
Come in! Come in!

01:18:49.531 --> 01:18:52.034
I'm gonna, I'm gonna pop this.

01:18:52.068 --> 01:18:53.535
That's how you open it, right?

01:18:53.569 --> 01:18:55.571
You just... pop.

01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:04.314
Okay, that comes to 29.83.

01:19:07.048 --> 01:19:08.551
That's my money.

01:19:11.454 --> 01:19:13.723
So, no sale, actually.

01:19:13.756 --> 01:19:16.191
Uh, should I put all this back?

01:19:16.225 --> 01:19:18.461
I'm-I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave.

01:19:18.494 --> 01:19:20.130
I'm gonna... Okay.

01:19:23.298 --> 01:19:25.068
You know, I-I didn't even...

01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:27.103
I forgot about
that whole thing.

01:19:28.303 --> 01:19:31.007
Did you forget about
robbing me?

01:19:31.039 --> 01:19:33.141
You forget that
you wanted to rob me?

01:19:33.175 --> 01:19:36.479
Wanted to gain access
to my account, remember?

01:19:36.512 --> 01:19:38.748
My brain is in my tits?

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.115
No.

01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:42.218
Th-That was just,
that was just a lie.

01:19:42.251 --> 01:19:44.186
Uh...

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.155
Y-You don't believe me.

01:19:46.187 --> 01:19:48.423
No, I believe you.

01:19:48.457 --> 01:19:50.760
You don't.

01:19:50.793 --> 01:19:52.762
- Well, what do I do?
- Okay.

01:19:52.794 --> 01:19:54.262
- What can I...
- The ringer was off.

01:19:54.296 --> 01:19:55.664
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You're okay.

01:19:55.698 --> 01:19:57.200
- You're okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. - Uh, here.

01:19:57.232 --> 01:19:58.735
- I'll... You want me to...
- Oh, my God.

01:19:58.767 --> 01:20:01.136
- I'll smash my finger with this!
- Are you all right?

01:20:01.169 --> 01:20:02.538
- I'll do it!
- Right. That was big.

01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:04.272
I called the second I heard.

01:20:04.306 --> 01:20:06.476
- I've been calling and calling and...
- Come back.

01:20:06.508 --> 01:20:08.243
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my heart is still pounding.

01:20:08.276 --> 01:20:09.712
I don't know what to do.

01:20:09.744 --> 01:20:11.613
- It was just so...
- I don't know what to do.

01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:14.182
- What do I do? What do I do?
- I could use a squeeze.

01:20:14.216 --> 01:20:15.685
- Squeeze, squeeze, Mama.
- I don't know what to do.

01:20:15.717 --> 01:20:17.653
I'm sorry. I...

01:20:17.686 --> 01:20:19.489
What is...

01:20:19.521 --> 01:20:21.524
What is that behind you?

01:20:24.526 --> 01:20:27.129
Maybe you should...

01:20:27.163 --> 01:20:29.199
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:21:06.334 --> 01:21:07.803
Thank you for waiting.

01:21:07.837 --> 01:21:09.305
Someone will be
with you shortly.

01:21:09.337 --> 01:21:11.273
They never pick up, so...

01:21:22.818 --> 01:21:24.820
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

01:21:24.854 --> 01:21:27.423
It's like, if you don't...

01:22:14.403 --> 01:22:17.173
Old Dolio? Can you hear us?

01:22:17.205 --> 01:22:18.708
Oh.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.743
We've been, we've been calling
and calling and calling.

01:22:20.775 --> 01:22:22.177
That was it.

01:22:22.211 --> 01:22:23.512
It was the big one.

01:22:23.546 --> 01:22:26.415
You okay?

01:22:30.452 --> 01:22:32.622
You're not ready to talk yet.

01:22:32.654 --> 01:22:34.223
That's okay.

01:22:36.257 --> 01:22:37.025
Just leave them here.

01:22:37.059 --> 01:22:38.261
- I am.
- Okay.

01:22:39.494 --> 01:22:40.762
- We're-we're going now.
- Okay.

01:22:40.796 --> 01:22:41.931
Bye-bye.

01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:30.613
"Happy birthday.

01:23:30.645 --> 01:23:32.914
Our little girl is 14. Love..."

01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:49.664
Newborn.

01:23:49.698 --> 01:23:54.503
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:55.770
seven, eight, nine, ten,

01:23:55.803 --> 01:23:59.676
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

01:24:02.744 --> 01:24:03.979
Where's the 18th one?

01:24:06.015 --> 01:24:07.316
This is crap.

01:24:07.348 --> 01:24:08.484
You know they're just...

01:24:08.516 --> 01:24:10.885
I know it's some kind of job.

01:24:10.918 --> 01:24:12.955
They're scamming me.

01:24:16.758 --> 01:24:17.792
"Happy birthday.

01:24:17.825 --> 01:24:19.761
"Our little girl is 18.

01:24:19.794 --> 01:24:21.830
Cordially invite..."

01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.736
They want to take me
out to dinner.

01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:30.373
Both of us.

01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:32.307
At Mélisse.

01:24:33.775 --> 01:24:35.910
It's for my 18th birthday.

01:24:35.944 --> 01:24:37.647
Is it your birthday?

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.383
No. And I'm 26.

01:24:44.552 --> 01:24:46.354
Don't go, right?

01:24:46.387 --> 01:24:47.722
- I have to.
- No.

01:24:47.756 --> 01:24:50.726
No, no, no. You actually...
But you don't. You...

01:24:52.093 --> 01:24:53.962
Then leave the money here.

01:24:53.995 --> 01:24:56.565
Just to make sure
that they don't...

01:25:06.574 --> 01:25:08.010
They think
I don't know anything

01:25:08.043 --> 01:25:10.680
about a sort of
fancy restaurant like that.

01:25:10.712 --> 01:25:12.947
Well, we're gonna walk in there
and they're gonna be like,

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.950
"Whoa. Who even are you now?"

01:25:26.128 --> 01:25:27.863
Hi. We're meeting two others.

01:25:27.895 --> 01:25:29.898
- Could be under Dyne.
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.303
They're probably gonna be late.
It's three bus rides.

01:25:37.573 --> 01:25:38.740
Nope.

01:25:45.847 --> 01:25:48.117
I usually like
to sit more in the back,

01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:49.519
but this table's fine.

01:25:52.454 --> 01:25:53.823
Thank you.

01:25:56.425 --> 01:25:58.761
Can I start you off
with some drinks?

01:25:58.793 --> 01:26:01.029
Uh, yes.

01:26:01.062 --> 01:26:04.367
I'll have, uh...
Do you still have the port?

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.736
The Colheita
or the tawny 20-year?

01:26:06.769 --> 01:26:10.472
Um, the, uh, the-the Colheita.

01:26:12.106 --> 01:26:14.642
I-I guess I'll... I will have

01:26:14.676 --> 01:26:16.412
the, um...

01:26:16.445 --> 01:26:20.015
um, the "Golaca..."

01:26:20.047 --> 01:26:21.783
Uh, actually, nothing. Water.

01:26:30.758 --> 01:26:34.062
Oh, isn't that the woman
who gave you the massage?

01:26:34.096 --> 01:26:37.066
Oh, hi.

01:26:37.098 --> 01:26:38.534
Hi.

01:26:40.836 --> 01:26:42.037
The healing arts.

01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:44.073
That's a solid profession.

01:26:44.105 --> 01:26:46.108
People are always in pain.

01:26:47.775 --> 01:26:49.811
So, what do your parents do,
Melanie?

01:26:49.845 --> 01:26:52.647
My mom works in real estate.

01:26:52.681 --> 01:26:53.716
Oh, Robert used to...

01:26:53.748 --> 01:26:55.117
I used to publish a, uh,

01:26:55.150 --> 01:26:56.919
resource guide
for real estate agents.

01:26:56.952 --> 01:26:58.820
- Yeah.
- With coupons.

01:26:58.854 --> 01:27:00.588
We were
straight shooters back then.

01:27:00.622 --> 01:27:02.557
I mean, if we're being
completely honest, we...

01:27:02.591 --> 01:27:04.593
Well, it was tough times.

01:27:04.626 --> 01:27:09.731
And, you know, the coupon book
didn't really take.

01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:11.834
Well, we were reacting
to the era.

01:27:11.867 --> 01:27:13.468
Uh, everybody was.

01:27:13.502 --> 01:27:14.736
Could I see the coupon book?

01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:16.739
Of course,
then the culture changed,

01:27:16.771 --> 01:27:19.507
and so now we look
sort of out of step.

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.510
Oh, maybe it'll change back.

01:27:46.068 --> 01:27:47.770
It's returnable.

36 hours ago, I...

01:28:31.846 --> 01:28:33.181
Sorry.

01:28:33.214 --> 01:28:37.520
We were very angry at you.

01:28:37.552 --> 01:28:42.290
But, um, I see now that
it was just a base response.

01:28:42.324 --> 01:28:44.527
It was just fear, really.

01:28:45.627 --> 01:28:46.928
Just fear.

01:28:46.962 --> 01:28:50.999
And then, after the big one
happened, I...

01:28:55.337 --> 01:28:57.640
This is hard.

01:28:57.672 --> 01:29:00.208
I'm not good at this.

01:29:00.242 --> 01:29:03.745
After the... I...
we got very worried.

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.949
We didn't think you were dead,

01:29:06.981 --> 01:29:10.051
but if you were dead...

01:29:10.084 --> 01:29:12.821
I would have regretted not...

01:29:15.123 --> 01:29:17.293
...doing enough things
to show you...

01:29:19.293 --> 01:29:22.096
See, because,
I don't know, I just...

01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:24.632
um, I just... I always
thought it was insulting

01:29:24.665 --> 01:29:25.967
to treat you like a child.

01:29:26.001 --> 01:29:29.305
It just, it just always
seemed so insincere.

01:29:29.337 --> 01:29:31.839
And-and I thought
we agreed on that.

01:29:31.873 --> 01:29:33.175
You know?

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:37.780
Um, but when, um...

01:29:37.812 --> 01:29:40.281
after the...

01:29:40.315 --> 01:29:42.718
the thing I just kept thinking
is I just want to,

01:29:42.751 --> 01:29:45.220
I just want
to hold her face.

01:29:47.655 --> 01:29:50.191
We've been very lucky
to have you.

01:29:53.928 --> 01:29:55.765
Oh, God.

01:30:03.204 --> 01:30:06.240
We are very, very lucky
to have you as our daughter.

01:30:08.677 --> 01:30:10.679
I'm sorry.

01:30:10.712 --> 01:30:13.214
I'm just sorry.

01:30:14.915 --> 01:30:16.918
Hey.

01:30:18.787 --> 01:30:22.191
Good night, sweet daughter.

01:30:22.223 --> 01:30:25.026
Have sweet dreams.

01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:30.365
Um, in the morning,
if you want, uh...

01:30:30.399 --> 01:30:33.002
I can make pancakes.

01:30:35.436 --> 01:30:36.805
T-Tomorrow's Friday.

01:30:36.837 --> 01:30:38.840
The check.

01:30:38.873 --> 01:30:40.842
We cashed it,
but we haven't spent it.

01:30:40.876 --> 01:30:42.645
Don't worry about the rent.

01:30:42.677 --> 01:30:44.379
We're the parents.

01:30:44.413 --> 01:30:46.315
We'll handle it.

01:30:46.347 --> 01:30:47.984
We've got a plan.

01:30:50.985 --> 01:30:52.020
Okay.

01:30:52.053 --> 01:30:55.156
Um, I guess I'll s...

01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:58.327
...see you tomorrow.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.396
- Yeah.
- Yep.

01:31:14.876 --> 01:31:16.845
So, if it's gone,

01:31:16.878 --> 01:31:20.082
they're monsters
and this whole night was a lie.

01:31:20.114 --> 01:31:21.416
Okay?

01:31:21.449 --> 01:31:26.688
But if it's there,
then this is all real.

01:31:27.855 --> 01:31:29.691
You'll believe that.

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:34.029
Wait, wait. Um...

01:31:36.364 --> 01:31:39.735
If it's just my third, 525...

01:31:41.336 --> 01:31:43.338
...then that means...

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:51.047
"We can only ever be
how we are.

01:31:54.850 --> 01:31:57.218
"But we love you and, um...

01:32:00.221 --> 01:32:02.791
...we wish you well."

01:32:21.776 --> 01:32:23.044
It's all there.

01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:52.107
I'll probably take off early
tomorrow before you're up.

01:32:57.145 --> 01:33:00.115
Thank you for everything.

01:33:00.147 --> 01:33:01.484
Really.

01:33:04.886 --> 01:33:06.388
No problem.

01:33:40.254 --> 01:33:41.556
Oh.

01:34:35.342 --> 01:34:37.046
So what?

01:36:34.262 --> 01:36:36.098
What?

01:37:17.372 --> 01:37:21.543
Okay, so your refund
comes to 485.05.
