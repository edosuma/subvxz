anything wrong.

Community service isn't just
something pro athletes do

to avoid jail time.
In the Other Realm,

02:12.933 --> 02:15.450

But I already feel fabulous
about myself. I love me.

If you want your witch's licence,
you do charity work,

05:29.378 --> 05:31.609

We tried. Oh, one last thing.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.239

- It scrapes tongues.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.436
No problem.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.314
Didn't work.

21:34.479 --> 21:36.039
- Is she gone yet?

Tongue scraper. Yuck!
