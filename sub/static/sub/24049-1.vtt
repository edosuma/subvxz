<i>It may look like just another
perfect day in sunny Kuala Lumpur Malaysia</i>

00:44.360 --> 00:46.505
<i>but it's not</i>

00:50.817 --> 00:56.070
<i>Because at San Francisco University,
a young woman has her college interview</i>

00:56.170 --> 01:00.773
<i>Today is the first day
of the rest ofher life</i>

01:00.873 --> 01:05.092
<i>And while she may look like
just another carefree college applicant-</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:12.284
<i>She's not</i>

01:12.384 --> 01:15.055
Excuse me.

01:15.154 --> 01:18.094
Do you know where the admissions office is?
- Left at the fire hydrant.

01:18.194 --> 01:20.225
Follow the path inside.
First floor.

01:20.325 --> 01:23.063
Thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

01:23.163 --> 01:25.709
Okay, that was weird.

01:28.721 --> 01:30.701
<i>She's Maya Dolittle</i>

01:30.801 --> 01:34.749
<i>And she can talk to animals
I mean, how cool is that?</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:51.625
Hi. I have a 9:00 appointment with
Admissions. Uh, it's Maya Dolittle.

01:51.724 --> 01:53.702
Dolittle. Maya Dolittle.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.034
As in Dr. Dolittle?

01:58.134 --> 02:01.071
As in the great
Dr. Dolittle?

02:01.170 --> 02:04.135
He's my dad.
- Yo, Frank.

02:04.235 --> 02:08.205
Come here, man. Check this out.
This is Dolittle's kid.

02:08.305 --> 02:10.476
<i>The guy who
single-handedly</i>

02:10.576 --> 02:12.611
saved that herd
of Sumatran rhinos?

02:12.710 --> 02:15.680
Yeah, that's him.
That's my dad.

02:15.779 --> 02:20.251
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I totally love Dr. "D."

02:20.351 --> 02:24.260
My cat, Mr. Smushy, and I have moved to
a whole new level in our relationship...

02:24.360 --> 02:27.027
and it's totally because of
his article, "Feeling Feline."

02:27.126 --> 02:31.049
Uh, I guess I
missed that one.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.633
Guys, I'm kinda
late here. Admissions?

02:35.733 --> 02:38.006
Oh, uh, down the hall
to the right.

02:38.105 --> 02:40.009
Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

02:40.109 --> 02:42.027
Bye.
- Bye.

02:44.230 --> 02:48.189
Bye. - Dolittle's
kid. - Wow.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.494
Hi.
- Good morning.

02:56.209 --> 02:59.893
Okay, Maya. Come
on. You can do this.

02:59.992 --> 03:02.431
You are confident
and capable.

03:02.531 --> 03:07.032
You will be as good a
veterinarian as your dad... someday.

03:07.131 --> 03:10.851
Okay, smile therapy.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.348
Okay.

03:19.448 --> 03:22.250
Hello, Maya. My name is Doris Park Weaver-
- Hello.

03:22.350 --> 03:26.222
Dean of Admissions for San Francisco
University's Center for Veterinary Medicine.

03:26.321 --> 03:29.591
Oh. It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, it is so nice to meet you.

03:29.690 --> 03:32.595
Your father's been an invaluable resource
to this institution.

03:32.695 --> 03:35.064
Oh, thank you.

03:35.163 --> 03:37.898
I saw him lecture once.
A most impressive man.

03:37.998 --> 03:39.902
Yeah, he's lectured me
many times.

03:40.002 --> 03:42.236
I mean, he's quite the lecturer.

03:42.336 --> 03:44.937
This is our admissions committee.
They wanted to meet you in person.

03:45.037 --> 03:49.209
Oh.
- Your father's thesis on anxiety disorders...

03:49.308 --> 03:51.545
in anubis baboons
was brilliant.

03:51.645 --> 03:54.646
Brilliant. Will you continue his
research on wombat mating habits?

03:54.745 --> 03:57.620
He's done so much
for the keel-billed Toucan.

03:57.719 --> 04:00.989
So much.
- You must be eager to follow in his footsteps.

04:01.088 --> 04:02.891
What's the title
of his next book?

04:02.990 --> 04:05.293
Do you think he'd sign a copy for me?
- Um, yes.

04:05.393 --> 04:07.994
I'm not sure.
And okay, why not?

04:08.093 --> 04:10.499
All righty then...

04:10.599 --> 04:12.915
let's have a look at
your transcripts, shall we?

04:15.688 --> 04:18.906
<i>Now then, uh</i>

04:19.005 --> 04:22.277
it appears your grades
are, uh-

04:22.376 --> 04:25.180
Okay.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.118
Yes, well, um, my emphasis
in the past year...

04:29.217 --> 04:33.853
has been more on... social aspects
of maturation versus academics...

04:33.953 --> 04:37.860
in the hopes to broaden
my... curriculum vitae.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.527
Ah. What about
extracurricular activities?

04:41.626 --> 04:44.196
Perhaps you've joined your father
on one of his expeditions.

04:44.296 --> 04:48.603
<i>I read about his latest trip up the Amazon
in Invertebrates Illustrated</i>

04:48.703 --> 04:51.304
Inspiring, truly.
- Mmm.

04:51.403 --> 04:54.690
Well, I was on the homecoming
committee last year.

04:59.932 --> 05:03.150
And it's a lot more
demanding than it sounds.

05:03.249 --> 05:04.850
Yeah.

05:04.950 --> 05:07.838
Well, let's look at your S.A.T. Scores.
- Right.

05:10.276 --> 05:11.727
Uh-

05:11.827 --> 05:15.529
<i>I've never been that great
in classroom situations</i>

05:15.628 --> 05:18.332
I find that I do better
in a real-worid environment.

05:18.431 --> 05:22.718
Perfect. We'd love to see you in action.
- In action?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.908
This is the clinic nursery.

05:26.008 --> 05:29.007
The committee and I
will observe you...

05:29.106 --> 05:32.014
<i>to see how you interact
with the animals</i>

05:32.114 --> 05:35.397
<i>Great Riece of cake</i>

05:36.936 --> 05:40.052
You just go ahead and kick back
and leave the babies to me.

05:40.151 --> 05:42.130
Yeah,
all righty then.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.194
Smile therapy.

05:46.293 --> 05:49.544
Listen. Listen up,
you guys. Come here.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.231
<i>Look, this is very,
very important</i>

05:54.331 --> 05:58.269
My interview didn't go so well just now,
so I really need to impress them here.

05:58.368 --> 06:03.043
<i>So if you guys would just cooperate, that
would be greatly appreciated, okay?</i>

06:03.143 --> 06:07.178
Okay, awesome. Um-

06:07.278 --> 06:11.225
So, boys and giris, what would
we like to play today?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.035
How about we sing a song?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.644
Oh! Hello there,
little goat.

06:21.781 --> 06:24.965
Uh, yes, I know that is
a sound a goat makes.

06:25.064 --> 06:29.715
But you don't have to do that with me
because I can talk to animals.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.642
She wants her bottle.
- Oh. Um, okay, yeah.

06:34.741 --> 06:38.147
Uh, "bah-bah." I knew that.

06:38.247 --> 06:41.279
Uh, okay. Um-

06:41.379 --> 06:43.961
You wanna drink your bottle?
Come on. Here you go.

06:46.372 --> 06:50.706
Hey! Over here, everyone!
Harvey's hatched! Harvey's hatched!

06:52.011 --> 06:55.708
Oh!

06:56.916 --> 06:59.835
Welcome to the worid, baby chick.
- Mama?

06:59.935 --> 07:02.771
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not your mama.

07:02.870 --> 07:07.276
Mama. Mama. Mama.
- Wha-

07:07.376 --> 07:11.747
Oh, don't cry, little kitty.

07:11.847 --> 07:15.380
You're my mew-mew.
- Your "mew-mew"? What is that?

07:15.480 --> 07:18.117
<i>She thinks you're her mom.
- Hey, Mom Hey, Mom</i>

07:18.217 --> 07:21.157
Guess what. Guess what. Guess what. Guess what.
- What?

07:21.256 --> 07:25.336
They all think you're their mom.
- I'm comin', Mama. Geronimo!

07:27.013 --> 07:30.461
Excuse me. Sorry.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.267
I got him.
I saved him.

07:34.367 --> 07:39.404
Hey, Mom, you got any treats in here?
- Hey, wait! That's my purse!

07:39.504 --> 07:42.006
Guess what. Guess what.
Guess what. Guess what.

07:42.105 --> 07:44.642
<i>Bag, man
Where's all the good stuff?</i>

07:44.742 --> 07:48.746
<i>Give me the- Look!
- Run for it!</i>

07:48.846 --> 07:52.316
<i>This is fun!
- Told you you couldn't keep us locked down.</i>

07:52.416 --> 07:56.136
<i>If you guys don't all stop this behavior,
you're all going to be on time-out!</i>

08:00.112 --> 08:04.500
<i>Guess what. Guess what. Guess what.
- What? What? What?</i>

08:04.599 --> 08:07.280
That's what.

08:14.660 --> 08:18.912
<i>Mom!
- I'm in the kitchen</i>

08:19.012 --> 08:22.092
So, how'd it go? How'd it go?
- Don't ask.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.365
So, uh, I'm guessing a game
of fetch is out of the question?

08:27.673 --> 08:30.789
So, how'd it go?
- I blew it.

08:30.889 --> 08:34.926
They wait-listed me. And they said
that was only because "I'm a Dolittle."

08:35.025 --> 08:37.399
Oh, Maya,
so sorry.

08:37.498 --> 08:41.837
Unless I can come up with a way to impress
the committee within the next four weeks...

08:41.936 --> 08:44.570
they suggest that I find
other alternatives to S.F.U.

08:44.670 --> 08:47.638
I don't know what I was thinking.
I am not cut out for vet school.

08:47.738 --> 08:49.842
Oh, don't be so hard
on yourself, Maya.

08:49.941 --> 08:52.280
You have so much
natural talent.

08:52.380 --> 08:55.346
It's gonna take some time
for you to develop it.

08:55.445 --> 08:57.982
But what if I can't?

08:58.082 --> 09:01.754
You're only 8.
Have faith, little one.

09:01.854 --> 09:05.458
You are gonna find your own way
of doing things. I promise.

09:05.557 --> 09:09.561
Ain't ya? Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:09.660 --> 09:12.311
Yeah. There you go.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.141
<i>You guys, my life is over</i>

09:21.241 --> 09:23.876
<i>Les femmes,
always so dramatic.</i>

09:23.976 --> 09:27.349
Talk to me after you've had your butt sniffed
by a Great Dane in a public park.

09:27.448 --> 09:32.017
Now that's hard to live down.
- You guys, I'm serious.

09:32.116 --> 09:35.754
I have four weeks to impress the admissions
committee, and I have no idea how to do it.

09:35.854 --> 09:39.227
<i>Did you try dropping my name?
Everyone loves Monkey</i>

09:39.327 --> 09:41.730
I am- how you say-
the breakout character.

09:41.830 --> 09:45.065
How 'bout I get stuck down a well
like on one of those TV shows?

09:45.165 --> 09:47.069
It'll be a huge story
and we'll get famous.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.884
Oh! I wonder if they'll get Lassie
to play me in the movie.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.642
<i>Sacre bleu!
It's animal control!</i>

09:58.742 --> 10:01.666
Quick, hide!

10:02.768 --> 10:05.601
The monkey has left
the building.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.861
<i>Don't look now,
but he's heading your way</i>

10:17.961 --> 10:20.700
<i>I'll get it.</i>

10:20.800 --> 10:22.901
Mmm, he's young, handsome,
winning smile.

10:23.001 --> 10:26.639
You better get downstairs and
make a fool of yourself right away.

10:26.739 --> 10:30.078
Hello.
- Hi. Mrs. Dolittle?

10:30.177 --> 10:33.548
Yes?
- My name is Cole Fletcher. I'm an aide at the White House.

10:33.648 --> 10:35.883
<i>This gentleman is
with the Secret Service</i>

10:35.982 --> 10:38.887
We're here on behalf of the
president of the United States.

10:38.987 --> 10:41.337
Oh, well, come in.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.795
What can I do
for you gentlemen?

10:51.895 --> 10:54.803
The president has asked to see Dr. Dolittle
at the White House right away.

10:54.903 --> 10:57.238
The President?
- The White House?

10:57.338 --> 10:59.674
Is he here?

10:59.774 --> 11:02.177
I'm sorry. Uh...

11:02.277 --> 11:06.209
he's in Antarctica saving
a pod of bowhead whales.

11:06.309 --> 11:10.151
Can it wait a few weeks until he comes back?
- I'm afraid not.

11:10.251 --> 11:13.020
It's an urgent matter, and no one else
is equipped to handle the situation.

11:13.119 --> 11:15.057
He needs someone
who can talk to animals.

11:15.157 --> 11:18.026
Well, I wish there was something
I could do to help, but-

11:18.126 --> 11:19.927
I can go.
- What?

11:20.026 --> 11:22.695
What?
- My name is Maya Dolittle.

11:22.795 --> 11:25.735
And I can talk to animals,
just like my dad.

11:25.834 --> 11:29.618
Really?
- Really.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.559
Jack of spades.
- Jack of spades.

11:41.801 --> 11:45.066
<i>Oh, please. Four of hearts.
- Four ofhearts</i>

11:46.972 --> 11:49.486
Like father, like daughter.

11:49.586 --> 11:51.960
Hold on. I need
to make a call.

11:52.059 --> 11:55.261
Okay. Well, just
take your time.

11:55.361 --> 12:00.330
Maya, I am not sure that this is a good idea.
- Mom.

12:00.430 --> 12:03.468
The admissions committee said I
needed to impress them, right? - Mm-hmm.

12:03.567 --> 12:06.740
So if I can get a recommendation
from the president of the United States...

12:06.839 --> 12:10.178
what's more impressive than that?
- I don't know, honey.

12:10.277 --> 12:12.613
Huh?

12:12.713 --> 12:16.247
Yes, sir.
Yes, I understand.

12:16.347 --> 12:20.465
Well, Miss Dolittle, looks like
you're going to the White House.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.735
We are goin' to the White House!
We are goin' to the White House! Ha-ha!

12:27.379 --> 12:29.264
This is unfair!
This is an outrage!

12:29.363 --> 12:31.598
I'm sorry, Monkey,
but you can't come.

12:31.698 --> 12:34.935
The last time I took you anywhere, we ended
up in jail for disturbing the peace.

12:35.034 --> 12:38.170
If Olive Garden doesn't want you to
throw food, they should have a sign.

12:38.270 --> 12:41.773
Look. I'm sorry, but
this is just too important.

12:41.872 --> 12:45.146
My whole future is riding on this.
I'll bring you back some soap.

12:45.245 --> 12:47.312
Later, Kong.

12:47.411 --> 12:50.926
Once again, you underestimate
the tiny genius in the silly T-shirt.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.966
<i># The TVsays I'm not
the girl that I should be #</i>

13:08.066 --> 13:09.971
<i>#It drives me crazy #</i>

13:10.071 --> 13:13.874
<i>#I'm not impressed
It isn't what I want to be #</i>

13:13.974 --> 13:15.877
<i>#So call me lazy #</i>

13:15.977 --> 13:18.110
<i>#Operator, operator #</i>

13:18.209 --> 13:21.549

13:21.649 --> 13:24.418
<i>#Operator, operator #</i>

13:24.517 --> 13:27.788
<i>#I'm just fine
I'll call you later #</i>

13:27.887 --> 13:31.923
<i># Why would I wanna be

13:32.022 --> 13:33.945
<i>#I'm never
gonna fake it #</i>

13:34.914 --> 13:37.799
<i># Why would I ever be
anybody else but me #</i>

13:37.899 --> 13:39.801
<i>#I know I'm
gonna make it #</i>

13:39.901 --> 13:42.270
<i># Without a doubt
I know what I'm about #</i>

13:42.369 --> 13:44.868
<i>#I'm everything
I ever wanna be #</i>

13:44.968 --> 13:47.674
<i>#A girl like me #</i>

13:47.773 --> 13:50.409
<i>#A girl like me #
- Wow!</i>

13:50.509 --> 13:54.079
<i>#A girl like me ##</i>

13:54.178 --> 13:57.383
I felt the same way the first time
I walked through those doors.

13:57.483 --> 14:00.563
Come on.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.063
Ah, porter,
my bag is in the trunk.

14:09.162 --> 14:11.946
Careful with the squeezy bone.
It's a family heirloom.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.470
Ah, Miss Dolittle.

14:17.569 --> 14:20.172
Maya, this is the president's
chief of staff, Mr. Harold Dorion.

14:20.271 --> 14:23.876
Nice to meet you, Mr. Dorion.
- Welcome to the White House. This is Selma Dixon.

14:23.975 --> 14:26.916
Both she and Cole are assigned
to my office as interns.

14:27.015 --> 14:30.250
Pleasure.
- Thank you, gentlemen. I'll take it from here.

14:30.350 --> 14:34.487
Cole, Selma, I need those G.D.P. Reports
on Kalampore on my desk in an hour.

14:34.586 --> 14:37.025
You'll have them in half an hour, sir.
- Excellent.

14:37.125 --> 14:40.062
This way, Miss Dolittle.

14:40.161 --> 14:43.464
You know, the president
is very anxious to meet you, Maya.

14:43.563 --> 14:48.768
And this is the West Wing. Although
the White House was finished in 800...

14:48.868 --> 14:52.139
the West Wing wasn't
added until 902.

14:52.238 --> 14:56.442
And the Oval Office itself
wasn't built until the 930s.

14:56.542 --> 15:00.347
For over 200 years, some of our
nation's most important decisions...

15:00.447 --> 15:03.948
have been made right here
in this office.

15:04.047 --> 15:08.052
I can't believe you're making me go. It's spring
break! All my friends are going to Florida!

15:08.151 --> 15:10.154
<i>"All of your friends"are not
the president's daughter</i>

15:10.253 --> 15:12.458
Courtney, this
is Maya Dolittle.

15:12.558 --> 15:15.295
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

15:15.394 --> 15:18.930
We're hoping
she grows out of it.

15:19.030 --> 15:23.284
Right, and I'm hoping they open
a Burger King for dogs, but I'm not optimistic.

15:26.492 --> 15:29.810
Mr. President.
- Maya.

15:29.910 --> 15:34.249
<i>Thank you for coming
I'm a huge fan of your father's</i>

15:34.348 --> 15:39.418
It's an honor, Mr. President.
- And who is this good-looking guy?

15:39.517 --> 15:44.533
The man's got my vote.
- This is Lucky. He is also at your service, Mr. President.

15:44.743 --> 15:48.928
You obviously understand dogs.
I hope you can help with mine.

15:49.027 --> 15:51.630
Please, sit down.
Harold?

15:51.729 --> 15:54.102
Yes, sir.

15:54.201 --> 15:57.268
<i>Yes, everyone knows
and loves Daisy</i>

15:57.368 --> 16:01.243
Mee-yowza!
- Daisy's been with the family since I was governor.

16:01.342 --> 16:04.043
She's been at my side
every step of my career.

16:04.143 --> 16:07.948
She was instrumental in the
president's election campaign.

16:08.048 --> 16:12.454
Look. There she is singing the
national anthem at a baseball game.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.519
She was perfectly in tune.
- That is so cute!

16:15.618 --> 16:20.056
Some people think she's a symbol
of this administration, of its humanity.

16:20.156 --> 16:25.230
<i>But lately, our
beloved First Dog has become, well</i>

16:25.329 --> 16:27.736
<i>a nightmare</i>

16:27.835 --> 16:31.071
She's running amok and we
don't know what to do about it.

16:31.170 --> 16:35.172
Ah, the woman of my dreams.
- Shh! Put a lid on it.

16:35.271 --> 16:38.478
I beg your pardon?
- Oh, no, not you. Him.

16:38.577 --> 16:41.078
<i>Sorry It takes
a while to get used to</i>

16:41.177 --> 16:45.019
So, basically what I'm hearing
is, is Daisy just needs a talking to.

16:45.119 --> 16:49.086
I can handle that.
- There's more to it than that, Maya.

16:49.185 --> 16:52.256
We're having a diplomatic crisis
with the country of Kalampore.

16:52.356 --> 16:56.861
You see, Maya, Kalampore is home to the
worid's second largest tropical rain forest.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.267
<i>The Boyd and Dunsmore Investment Group
wants to develop the land</i>

17:00.367 --> 17:03.204
and has made a very lucrative
offer to the royal family of Kalampore.

17:03.303 --> 17:07.107
If the development deal goes through,
the rain forest will be totally destroyed...

17:07.207 --> 17:10.376
<i>and with it, thousands
of species that make it home</i>

17:10.474 --> 17:12.178
<i>That's awful.
- But the president</i>

17:12.277 --> 17:14.683
has convinced the head of the
royal family, Prince Tharoor...

17:14.781 --> 17:18.519
<i>to reject the Dunsmore offer,
and instead has proposed a treaty</i>

17:18.617 --> 17:21.117
that would permanently protect
the land as an animal preserve.

17:21.217 --> 17:25.959
The prince was all set to sign this historic
agreement last month in Kalampore...

17:26.059 --> 17:29.127
and things went
horribly wrong.

17:29.226 --> 17:34.034
Unfortunately, the president came down
with a terrible case of... food poisoning.

17:34.134 --> 17:36.470
Oh, no, he didn't.
- Oh, no, don't say it.

17:36.570 --> 17:39.217
Oh, yes.
All over the prince.

17:40.626 --> 17:44.608
Jelly beans?
- No, thank you.

17:44.707 --> 17:49.382
The deal didn't get signed.
The moment passed...

17:49.481 --> 17:51.386
and the deal fell apart.

17:51.486 --> 17:53.388
Oh, no.

17:53.488 --> 17:57.657
<i>We've invited the prince to the US
We're gonna hold a state dinner in his honor</i>

17:57.756 --> 18:00.859
It's a last-ditch effort
to repair the relationship...

18:00.958 --> 18:02.898
and convince him to sign
the agreement.

18:02.997 --> 18:05.062
And that's where you
come in, Maya. You see...

18:05.162 --> 18:07.867
the prince's daughter
is a huge fan of Daisy.

18:07.966 --> 18:10.270
She's practically
Daisy crazy.

18:10.370 --> 18:14.838
And of course, she wants
to meet her... in person.

18:14.938 --> 18:17.312
<i>Yikes.
- Exactly</i>

18:17.411 --> 18:20.945
The prince arrives
in... eight days.

18:21.045 --> 18:24.616
What- Eight days?

18:24.715 --> 18:27.088
Maya...
- l-

18:27.187 --> 18:30.958
we need you to deliver the old Daisy
before the state dinner.

18:31.057 --> 18:32.977
We are counting on you.

18:35.347 --> 18:38.646
Send in Daisy, please.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.775
<i>Hi, Daisy. I'm-
- Listen</i>

18:48.875 --> 18:52.545
If you think you can waltz in here with your
head-shrinking, animal-talking circus act...

18:52.644 --> 18:55.314
<i>and turn me into some perfect,
hand-licking First Dog</i>

18:55.413 --> 18:57.819
<i>then you've got another
thing coming, sister</i>

18:57.918 --> 18:59.984
I'll chew you up like
an off-white athletic sock...

19:00.084 --> 19:02.991
then I'll poop you out
in the Rose Garden.

19:03.091 --> 19:05.976
Wh-What did she say, Maya?

19:07.212 --> 19:09.828
Uh, she said, "Hi."

19:09.927 --> 19:11.746
Ah.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.902
Hello, Daisy.

19:17.001 --> 19:20.875
Daisy! Uh, Maya, please
tell her not to do that.

19:20.975 --> 19:24.311
Daisy, do not sneeze on
the chief of staff s pants.

19:24.411 --> 19:26.956
Oh. Okay. Well, then how
'bout this sort of thing?

19:29.968 --> 19:31.697
Daisy.

19:37.075 --> 19:39.339
Oh!

19:41.246 --> 19:43.895
Harold.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Come here, Daisy-

19:43.995 --> 19:46.834
Nice try, Harold.
- Daisy!

19:46.934 --> 19:49.911
<i>Daisy, sit!
- Daisy, no!</i>

19:58.330 --> 20:02.048
<i>#I'm tired, baby
Tired of messin'with my head #</i>

20:02.147 --> 20:04.614
Whoops.
- No!

20:04.714 --> 20:07.453
<i>#Gonna pull myself
from the ledge ##</i>

20:07.553 --> 20:09.905
<i>Whoops!</i>

20:11.810 --> 20:14.404
See ya.
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.641
What a ride.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.404
Harold.
- Sir?

20:26.504 --> 20:28.809
Have everybody pack up-

20:28.908 --> 20:33.343
<i>the staff, the interns,
the dog, Courtney.</i>

20:33.443 --> 20:35.730
<i>We're going
to the ranch today!</i>

20:36.969 --> 20:39.821
The ranch?

20:39.920 --> 20:44.888
The Sterling Ranch.
The president's... retreat.

20:44.988 --> 20:47.070
I call shotgun!

21:46.338 --> 21:48.419
Maya, come with me.

21:48.519 --> 21:51.156
Anyone else who wants
the grand tour, hop in.

21:51.256 --> 21:54.974
Go on. Go on.
I don't need you.

22:02.587 --> 22:05.920
<i>All right, here we go</i>

22:50.235 --> 22:53.432
Hey, anyone over there
got lotion? My skin is so dry.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.592
Hmm, maybe I can find
some aloe in here.

22:59.691 --> 23:04.228
Where do all the animals come from?
- Oh, different places.

23:04.328 --> 23:08.703
Some were rescued, some were gifts
of foreign dignitaries.

23:08.803 --> 23:11.802
We started the reserve to protect
a few endangered species.

23:11.901 --> 23:14.404
And now we have
over 30 species.

23:14.504 --> 23:18.953
Dozens have been bred
and released back into the wild.

23:28.140 --> 23:31.507
Hey, hey! How's
the weather down there?

23:35.680 --> 23:38.762
Wow! It's incredible.

23:38.862 --> 23:41.114
Hey, guys, look-
people.

23:46.024 --> 23:49.309
This land has been in my family
for over a century.

23:49.408 --> 23:53.078
About 5 years ago, I
fulfilled a dream of a lifetime:

23:53.178 --> 23:58.125
Created this nature preserve
and family retreat.

24:03.041 --> 24:06.557
I'm not really
an animal person.

24:06.656 --> 24:08.659
Allergies.

24:08.758 --> 24:10.681
<i>Hmph.</i>

24:12.951 --> 24:15.370
Many of the worid's
greatest leaders have stayed here.

24:15.469 --> 24:18.339
<i>And a lot ofhistory
made in this place</i>

24:18.439 --> 24:22.985
It's my hope that next week...
history will be made again.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.699
Ahh. Free at last.

24:45.798 --> 24:48.548
Now where can a monkey
freshen up around here?

24:53.725 --> 24:57.217
And this brings us back
to the compound.

24:58.363 --> 25:02.047
<i>Everybody,
heads up! Incoming!</i>

25:02.146 --> 25:05.215
What's that?

25:05.315 --> 25:08.453
Oh, that used to be
Courtney's play yard.

25:08.553 --> 25:12.792
Now we use it for some animals who live
over there in a specially designed habitat.

25:12.892 --> 25:15.244
Go take a look.
- Okay.

25:17.315 --> 25:20.268
<i>Hold up a second,
blokes Whoa Look at the sheila</i>

25:20.368 --> 25:23.569
Hola, chica.
- Wow, hey, guys.

25:23.669 --> 25:25.607
Hi, darling. How ya doin'?

25:25.706 --> 25:27.406
Hello, beautiful
lady person.

25:27.505 --> 25:30.445
Oh, no. This is bad.
I am sensing very bad.

25:30.545 --> 25:33.414
Don't mind him. He's a few
sandwiches short of a picnic.

25:33.514 --> 25:35.883
<i>Look out below!</i>

25:35.982 --> 25:38.751
Lucky, this is a wallaby.

25:38.851 --> 25:42.921
A rock wallaby to be exact.
As in rock and roll! Bonzer good times!

25:43.020 --> 25:46.861
Whoo-hoo! Oi, mates. Let's party!
Where's the Pop Tarts? Come on!

25:46.960 --> 25:49.459
Let's go!

25:49.559 --> 25:51.730
Okay, that wallaby
needs to chill.

25:51.829 --> 25:54.932
<i>Tell me about it Reminds me
of this guy I used to date, Javier</i>

25:55.032 --> 25:58.305
<i>Always about how his fur
looked I'm Rosie, by the way</i>

25:58.404 --> 26:00.308
You need the 4
on anyone or anything?

26:00.408 --> 26:02.974
These ears can hear a pin drop
from a thousand yards.

26:03.073 --> 26:05.811
<i>She calls it 411
I call it gossip</i>

26:05.911 --> 26:08.282
And gossip is bad-
very, very bad.

26:08.381 --> 26:10.149
Oh, put an ant in it,
bug breath.

26:10.249 --> 26:13.329
Let's party!

26:14.339 --> 26:16.257
It was great. Yeah.
- You liked it.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.366
Scintillating.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.140
Wow. I love what
you've done with the place.

26:26.651 --> 26:29.733
What happened?
- Daisy.

26:29.833 --> 26:34.270
But we've only been here a few minutes.
- She works fast.

26:34.370 --> 26:38.261
Welcome to Sterling Ranch.
Hope you have a pleasant stay.

26:40.966 --> 26:44.616
Come on, Daisy.
Good girl. Here we go.

26:44.716 --> 26:47.020
<i>Mr Rresident?</i>

26:47.120 --> 26:49.254
Maya, I have to go
to a meeting.

26:49.353 --> 26:52.057
The porters will show you
to your room.

26:52.157 --> 26:54.373
I'm afraid you have
your work cut out for you.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.928
Smile therapy?

26:58.027 --> 27:01.031
Oh, forget it!
That doesn't work anyway!

27:01.130 --> 27:04.020
<i>Not on the bookcase</i>

27:07.092 --> 27:08.875
Well, I'm unpacked.

27:08.974 --> 27:13.943
What am I gonna do? Daisy's not a dog.
She's Hannibal Lecter with fur!

27:14.043 --> 27:17.418
I may be able to talk to animals,
but I cannot work miracles.

27:17.517 --> 27:21.220
<i>Maya, one thing I know about you is that
you underestimate yourself.</i>

27:21.319 --> 27:24.023
And sometimes you don't
apply yourself completely.

27:24.122 --> 27:26.027
Have you been reading
my report card again?

27:26.127 --> 27:28.029
Read it? I forged your
dad's signature, remember?

27:28.129 --> 27:30.295
If I want a recommendation
from the president...

27:30.395 --> 27:34.567
I'm gonna have to whip crazy Daisy
into shape in less than a week.

27:34.666 --> 27:38.236
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

27:38.335 --> 27:40.337
I think I've bitten off
more than I can chew.

27:40.436 --> 27:44.210
Been there. Never forget that time
I caught the Volkswagen.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.680
I wish I could reach Dad.
He would know what to do.

27:46.780 --> 27:51.748
Why don't you just figure out what he would
do in the same situation, and try that?

27:51.847 --> 27:53.754
Hey, that's not such
a bad idea.

27:53.854 --> 27:57.956
We're not man's
best friend for nothin'.

27:58.055 --> 28:01.294
Hey. Hey, can you fix my hair?
I don't have thumbs.

28:01.393 --> 28:04.827
First of all, Daisy, I would like to thank you
for agreeing to meet with me.

28:04.926 --> 28:07.267
That was very civilized
and mature of you.

28:07.367 --> 28:10.136
Well, I got to thinking
about my recent behavior...

28:10.235 --> 28:12.769
and decided it was
probably time to get some help.

28:12.869 --> 28:15.574
Oh, okay.
So, um, tell me...

28:15.673 --> 28:19.845
when did you first notice these
feelings of hostility surfacing?

28:19.944 --> 28:23.317
<i>Gosh I think, maybe, it
all began when the president</i>

28:23.416 --> 28:25.516
started bringing home
all these other animals.

28:25.615 --> 28:27.184
I see. I see.

28:27.283 --> 28:30.191
I think I might be,
well, jealous?

28:30.291 --> 28:34.094
Yes, jealous.
I see. I see.

28:34.194 --> 28:36.828
In fact, I just have so much
to get off my chest...

28:36.928 --> 28:40.233
maybe it would be a good idea
if we all met, you know, like-

28:40.333 --> 28:44.604
Group therapy?
- Yes! Group therapy!

28:44.703 --> 28:47.157
I'll meet you at the
habitat in 0 minutes.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.925
Maybe this won't be
as hard as I thought.

28:54.999 --> 28:58.149
Hey, Daisy's back. How ya been, darlin'?
- What's the word, sister?

28:58.249 --> 29:01.819
Hey, you guys. I got a problem
that I need you to help me get rid of.

29:01.918 --> 29:05.672
Whatever you need, Daisy, girl.
- Your wish is my command, my Daisy.

29:23.094 --> 29:27.076
Hello?
- Holy cow! You scared me to death.

29:27.176 --> 29:30.815
Uh, sorry.
- Close the door. Close the door!

29:30.915 --> 29:32.719
<i>Would you please?
Would you close the door?</i>

29:32.818 --> 29:35.920
<i>Rlease close it!</i>

29:36.019 --> 29:38.589
Uh, would you like to join us
for group therapy?

29:38.688 --> 29:41.758
Oh, I would love to,
but what if I see my shadow?

29:41.858 --> 29:45.327
<i>What if I don't? It could affect the climate
of the entire planet if I do</i>

29:45.427 --> 29:49.100
Ah, the pressure is killing me!
- An agoraphobic groundhog?

29:49.200 --> 29:51.212
Pretty twisted, I know.

29:52.457 --> 29:56.675
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll just see you later.

29:56.775 --> 30:00.681
Maybe.

30:00.781 --> 30:05.395
<i>Go to your safe place Go to
your safe place Go to your safe place</i>

30:08.807 --> 30:13.728
Everyone, this is Maya.
And she can talk to animals.

30:13.828 --> 30:15.527
Hello, Maya.

30:15.627 --> 30:18.797
Hi.

30:18.896 --> 30:22.033
Wait a second.
Have we met before?

30:22.133 --> 30:25.568
No, no, never.
I am, uh, Aldo.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.704
<i>Aldo, the Italian monkey</i>

30:27.804 --> 30:30.745
And I am from...
Napoli!

30:30.845 --> 30:33.297
<i>Okay, Aldo</i>

30:34.666 --> 30:38.215
So, as many of you
already know, this is Daisy...

30:38.315 --> 30:41.087
and she's been having some issues
she would like to discuss with you guys.

30:41.186 --> 30:43.624
Daisy?

30:43.724 --> 30:47.224
Okay. Well, Daisy's
having a quiet moment.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.610
Is there anybody else
who'd like to say something?

30:51.449 --> 30:53.868
Hmm.
- Mmm.

30:53.967 --> 30:57.771
Conflicts? Issues? Anything?

30:57.871 --> 31:01.405
Come on, you guys. There's gotta be
something you wanna talk about.

31:01.504 --> 31:06.678
Fine. I remember once back in New Delhi
at the zoo- Oh, this was very, very bad.

31:06.777 --> 31:10.414
If I have to hear this story one more time,
I'm gonna throw myself on a trap.

31:10.514 --> 31:14.562
<i>You are rude. Very, very rude!
- I'm rude?</i>

31:17.375 --> 31:20.092
People. I mean, folks.
I mean, animals!

31:20.191 --> 31:22.646
Everybody, just chill out!

31:24.616 --> 31:26.764
Nyah.
- All right, that's just gross.

31:26.864 --> 31:30.367
Now let's all listen and respect
what each other has to say.

31:30.466 --> 31:33.583
Actually, there is something
I'd like to say.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.877
Bombs away!

31:36.977 --> 31:39.725
Bomb bay doors open!

31:42.033 --> 31:43.951
Aha! Bull's-eye!

31:44.051 --> 31:48.422
<i>Nice shot Man
your battle stations!</i>

31:48.522 --> 31:51.054
To the barricades!

31:51.154 --> 31:52.905
Pass the ammunition.

31:56.614 --> 31:58.831
Anteater! Run
for your lives!

31:58.930 --> 32:00.599
Fire at will!

32:00.698 --> 32:02.502
Gotcha!

32:02.601 --> 32:05.337
<i>Mon dieu!
I mean, mamma mia!</i>

32:05.437 --> 32:08.438
You better stop-

32:08.537 --> 32:10.357
Take-a this!

32:12.230 --> 32:14.446
Stop it! Oh-

32:14.546 --> 32:19.526
I demand you stop this behavior!

32:22.774 --> 32:24.708
Direct hit!

32:26.044 --> 32:28.524
One egg-a, scrambled!

32:28.624 --> 32:31.330
<i>So long, girlie!</i>

32:31.429 --> 32:33.350
<i>Thanks for stoppin'by!</i>

32:47.131 --> 32:49.679
All right, let's
get back to work.

32:49.779 --> 32:52.258
I guess she's
the comic relief.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.327
Hi. Can I have some
roast beef, please?

33:03.427 --> 33:07.897
How 'bout you accidentally drop a T-bone
on the ground for your old pal here?

33:07.997 --> 33:10.702
Forget about it. You
know it gives you gas.

33:10.802 --> 33:14.019
Uh- Oh, no, not you.
The dog.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.590
Don't judge me.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.584
Excuse me.
Nature calls.

33:25.684 --> 33:28.387
Hey, how's it goin'?
Have you tried the steak?

33:28.486 --> 33:31.055
So, Maya, how did it
go today with Daisy?

33:31.154 --> 33:33.960
Uh, it was... colorful.

33:34.060 --> 33:37.465
Hmm. Good colorful,
or bad colorful?

33:37.564 --> 33:40.062
Like a medium colorful.

33:40.162 --> 33:43.037
Well, I'm afraid a medium colorful
just isn't gonna cut it.

33:43.136 --> 33:46.636
Maya, we need bold, brilliant, vibrant,
primary colors here.

33:46.736 --> 33:50.774
We need a full-on, five-star
rainbow, and we need it fast.

33:50.873 --> 33:53.044
Yes, sir.
- Oh, and, Maya...

33:53.144 --> 33:55.746
<i>that, uh, scene today
outside the barn-</i>

33:55.846 --> 33:58.752
Just make sure that kind of thing doesn't
happen in front of the president.

33:58.852 --> 34:03.122
I will, sir. I mean, I won't.
It-It won't, sir.

34:03.221 --> 34:05.141
Good.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.993
Okay, check it out:
"Herro," Shaggy.

34:10.092 --> 34:11.763
Rooby-rooby-doo!

34:11.862 --> 34:14.565
<i>That's my Scooby-Doo</i>

34:14.665 --> 34:18.004
Gee, with that material, I'm surprised
you don't have your own TV show.

34:18.103 --> 34:20.069
<i>Wait Hang on</i>

34:20.168 --> 34:22.649
"Herro," Reorge. Ruh-oh.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.077
<i>Astro?</i>

34:27.176 --> 34:29.583
<i>From TheJetsons?</i>

34:29.683 --> 34:32.485
<i>You have got
to get some new material.</i>

34:32.585 --> 34:36.438
Tough crowd.
- Thank you.

34:46.617 --> 34:50.053
Maya, you want to join us?
- Sure.

34:52.489 --> 34:55.606
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mayo.
Did you want to sit here?

34:55.705 --> 34:59.220
It's Maya.

35:01.199 --> 35:03.483
So, Maya, tell us
a little bit about yourself.

35:03.582 --> 35:07.454
Oh, uh, well, I'm a senior
at Hamilton High in San Francisco.

35:07.554 --> 35:10.390
<i>Really? And where are
you going to school next year?</i>

35:10.490 --> 35:13.557
Um, well, I'm still
assessing my options.

35:13.656 --> 35:15.908
But I'm considering
S.F.U.'s vet school.

35:18.983 --> 35:22.268
But why can't I go?
- We've been over this before.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.569
You can't go because I think
it's inappropriate...

35:24.669 --> 35:26.804
for the First Daughter
to be at a party unsupervised.

35:26.903 --> 35:30.407
This is so unfair!
Mom would let me go.

35:30.506 --> 35:35.011
Well, your mother happens to be making a
four-nation tour, and I'm in charge around here.

35:35.111 --> 35:38.952
What about you guys? Where do you go?
- We both go to Yale.

35:39.051 --> 35:42.220
I'm a poli-sci major, and Selma's studying
International Relations.

35:42.319 --> 35:46.491
With a minor in foreign languages:
French, German, Russian and Cantonese.

35:46.590 --> 35:49.659
I intend to make an impact
on global politics by the time I'm 30.

35:49.759 --> 35:52.531
<i>What about you?
What's your long-term goal?</i>

35:52.631 --> 35:56.503
Long term? Um, I guess just
to take care of animals.

35:56.603 --> 36:00.373
Oh, you mean like a
doggie day care? How sweet.

36:00.472 --> 36:03.574
No, I mean, like a
veterinarian. A doctor.

36:03.673 --> 36:08.346
But if you can't fix
the president's dog...

36:08.446 --> 36:11.447
how are you gonna fix
other people's animals?

36:11.547 --> 36:15.017
Oh. Could you pass
the mayo, Maya?

36:15.117 --> 36:19.873
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
I don't speak snob.

36:24.982 --> 36:26.900
What?

36:27.000 --> 36:30.904
I just don't understand you.
I mean, the state dinner could be fun if-

36:31.004 --> 36:34.774
Right. It's just so fun to have the
best years of my life sucked away...

36:34.873 --> 36:39.477
by stupid press events, dull political speeches
and boring state dinners.

36:39.576 --> 36:41.555
Thanks, Dad!

36:48.539 --> 36:52.392
Maya!
- Yes, sir.

36:52.491 --> 36:55.491
The chief tells me that
you're making headway with Daisy.

36:55.591 --> 36:58.094
I want a full progress
report tomorrow, all right?

36:58.193 --> 37:00.514
Yes, sir, sir.
- I'm counting on you.

37:11.162 --> 37:15.015
How can I give a progress report
when I haven't made any progress?

37:15.114 --> 37:18.817
I don't get why she doesn't dig me.
You think I should grow a beard?

37:18.916 --> 37:21.788
Lucky, I have to find a different
way to deal with these animals.

37:21.888 --> 37:25.658
Because Dad's way just isn't working.
What usually works with you?

37:25.757 --> 37:28.291
Well, a biscuit always
seems to do nicely.

37:28.391 --> 37:31.815
Yeah, right,
like that's gonna work.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.318
Hmm.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.277
You comin' out today?

37:44.377 --> 37:46.814
I would, but I'm
shampooing my tail.

37:46.913 --> 37:48.956
Suit yourself.

37:53.170 --> 37:56.787
Hey, everybody,
look what I've got. Treats!

37:56.886 --> 37:58.854
<i>Ding, ding Round two!</i>

37:58.954 --> 38:02.363
<i>Watch your
head, you monkey!</i>

38:02.462 --> 38:06.096
<i>Say hello to my little friend!
- There you go!</i>

38:06.196 --> 38:09.699
<i>Enjoy my spicy red ant special</i>

38:09.798 --> 38:13.471
<i>That's gonna be hard
to get out of your hair!</i>

38:13.570 --> 38:15.475
<i>Oh, forget it!</i>

38:15.575 --> 38:18.357
<i>Come back soon, all right?</i>

38:21.399 --> 38:24.583
<i>Maya What happened?</i>

38:24.682 --> 38:26.587
I, um-

38:26.687 --> 38:28.487
See-

38:28.587 --> 38:31.769
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm no good at this.

38:33.911 --> 38:36.903
Maya.
- Please, just leave me alone.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.902
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

38:44.002 --> 38:47.740
I'm never gonna get that recommendation,
so why keep embarrassing myself?

38:47.839 --> 38:50.277
But what about Daisy and me?
You know, she completes me.

38:50.377 --> 38:54.281
Look. I've already let down my family
and the president of the United States.

38:54.381 --> 38:58.252
Forget it. I'm cuttin' my losses.
We're on the next copter out of here.

38:58.351 --> 39:03.786
<i>Cole, I said I just
wanna be left... alone.</i>

39:03.885 --> 39:06.855
Maya, am I...
interrupting?

39:06.955 --> 39:08.794
No, sir. I was just
packing up.

39:08.894 --> 39:14.532
I'm sorry I disappointed you, sir, but I should
have never come here in the first place.

39:14.631 --> 39:17.212
Maya, let's take a walk.

39:27.498 --> 39:32.015
<i>You remind me a lot of
myself when I was your age</i>

39:32.114 --> 39:34.853
I do?
- Demanded a lot of myself.

39:34.953 --> 39:38.224
Expected way too much
too soon.

39:38.323 --> 39:40.743
<i>Meet my friends</i>

39:46.150 --> 39:48.630
So, did you know...

39:48.730 --> 39:51.003
that MichaelJordan...

39:51.102 --> 39:55.307
didn't make his high school
varsity basketball team?

39:55.406 --> 40:00.179
MichaelJordan? The best
basketball player ever? No way.

40:00.279 --> 40:03.549
Way.

40:03.648 --> 40:08.021
Did you know that Einstein failed
his first college entrance exam?

40:08.121 --> 40:12.655
<i>Wait. "E" equals "MC" squared Einstein? Really?
- Yep</i>

40:12.755 --> 40:17.828
Did you know in high school
I ran for class president?

40:17.927 --> 40:21.768
I lost.
I came in fourth.

40:21.867 --> 40:24.434
Well, that's not too bad.

40:24.534 --> 40:28.673
Out of four?
- Okay, that's bad.

40:28.772 --> 40:31.043
The only thing that
saved me at that time...

40:31.142 --> 40:34.480
was I had a motto I kept
on my desk by Hank Aaron...

40:34.580 --> 40:37.147
a famous ballplayer
before your time.

40:37.246 --> 40:40.452
Two words:
"Keep swinging."

40:40.551 --> 40:44.391
<i>He used to say that no matter
how bad his slump was</i>

40:44.490 --> 40:46.556
no matter how badly
he felt...

40:46.656 --> 40:49.760
he just had
to keep swingin'.

40:49.859 --> 40:52.496
But, sir, I'm just afraid I can't-
- Maya.

40:52.596 --> 40:55.969
"We have nothing to fear
but fear itself."

40:56.068 --> 40:59.102
That was Franklin Roosevelt.

40:59.201 --> 41:02.682
You come with me. There's
somebody I want you to meet.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.500
Come on, Maya.

41:11.702 --> 41:14.683
<i>So, this is Lenore</i>

41:14.783 --> 41:16.899
She's a red ruffed lemur.

41:19.743 --> 41:22.268
Give her some
gooseberries. She likes 'em.

41:26.250 --> 41:30.671
She was captured by poachers as a baby,
delivered to a Malaysian circus.

41:30.770 --> 41:35.338
Somehow she made her way
to an Indonesian zoo and then here.

41:35.438 --> 41:37.344
<i>She's an endangered species</i>

41:37.444 --> 41:39.610
And we had hopes of returning
her to her homeland...

41:39.710 --> 41:42.447
but unless I can get the prince
to sign this agreement...

41:42.547 --> 41:44.467
the rain forest
will be destroyed.

41:45.703 --> 41:48.718
And the other lemurs like Lenore?
- Absolutely.

41:48.817 --> 41:52.923
Did you know that, on average,
74 species a day become extinct?

41:53.023 --> 41:55.794
I had no idea.
- Most people don't.

41:55.894 --> 41:58.394
<i>All of us have so much
more to learn</i>

41:58.493 --> 42:03.870
Maya, failure is a part of life,
even for successful people.

42:03.970 --> 42:07.706
The trick is... what are
you gonna do about the failure?

42:07.805 --> 42:11.454
Are you gonna quit, or are
you gonna keep on swinging?

42:21.572 --> 42:24.120
Lucky, drop that bone,
unpack those bags.

42:24.220 --> 42:27.392
I just got a pep talk from the
president of the United States.

42:27.491 --> 42:29.396
And we are stayin'.

42:29.496 --> 42:32.995
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

42:33.095 --> 42:36.098
Whoa. Getting dizzy.
Oh, getting dizzy.

42:36.197 --> 42:40.782
Why do dogs have to do this
when they're happy?

42:40.991 --> 42:43.674
<i>#And if you think #</i>

42:43.774 --> 42:48.480
<i># That you
could do better #</i>

42:48.580 --> 42:51.080
<i>#She's got some
pretty wise sage advice #</i>

42:51.179 --> 42:54.954
<i>#For you if you let her #</i>

42:55.053 --> 42:57.424
<i>#And she'll
let you know #</i>

42:57.523 --> 43:00.022
<i># We never go
in the heat of competition #</i>

43:00.121 --> 43:01.961
<i># Tell me everything
you know #</i>

43:02.060 --> 43:05.466
<i>#About the human
condition And wait #</i>

43:05.565 --> 43:07.934
<i># Till the meter maids
are doin'their job #</i>

43:08.033 --> 43:12.270
<i>#And they're callin'the cops
'cause they're afraid too #</i>

43:12.370 --> 43:15.257
<i># 'Cause it's makin'a lot #</i>

43:31.775 --> 43:34.391
<i>What are you doing?</i>

43:34.490 --> 43:39.245
Did you know that Cavalier King Charles
spaniels were originally bred for British royalty?

43:40.851 --> 43:43.534
Here you go, Daisy.

43:43.634 --> 43:45.539
Okay.

43:45.639 --> 43:48.717
So, what do you think?
What do you think?

43:57.601 --> 43:59.535
Stee-rike one.

44:08.912 --> 44:11.494
It's important that you keep me posted
on exactly when and where...

44:11.594 --> 44:14.563
the prince and his-
when the prince comes-

44:14.663 --> 44:17.869
<i>Hold on a second</i>

44:17.969 --> 44:19.873
Maya, what are you doing?

44:19.973 --> 44:22.038
Did you know that King Charles
spaniels are the happiest...

44:22.138 --> 44:24.044
when they're sitting
in someone's lap?

44:24.144 --> 44:26.892
I think it's working.

44:37.374 --> 44:40.366
I'll have to call you back.

44:43.714 --> 44:45.705
Stee-rike two.

44:52.790 --> 44:56.474
Do you know that your breed is extremely
social and loves to play and fetch?

44:56.573 --> 44:59.744
Two words: "Give up."
- Two words: "No way."

44:59.843 --> 45:01.979
One word: "Later"!

45:02.078 --> 45:05.297
Just keep swingin'.

45:06.470 --> 45:09.018
Stee-rike three!
You're out.

45:09.118 --> 45:12.222
Remember back in ninth grade when I had
that cafeteria feud with Wendy Boudreau?

45:12.321 --> 45:15.729
Who could forget her? Her face looked like
the business end of a bulldog.

45:15.829 --> 45:20.430
And how did I handle that situation?
I made friends with her friends.

45:20.530 --> 45:22.998
Interesting. I would
have just pooped in her shoes.

45:23.097 --> 45:26.750
Lucky, I think it's time for
another group therapy sessión.

45:27.825 --> 45:29.816
Come on.

45:39.369 --> 45:42.485
Hey, are you gonna join us today?

45:42.585 --> 45:44.356
Ah, uh, yeah, I, um-

45:44.455 --> 45:47.625
Remember what F.D.R. Said:
"We have nothing to fear but fear itself."

45:47.724 --> 45:51.030
<i>You're right You're right You're absolutely
right I'm coming out Here I come</i>

45:51.129 --> 45:53.033
Doh!

45:53.133 --> 45:57.383
<i>I just can't do it
- Okay. Whenever you're ready.</i>

46:04.261 --> 46:08.013
All right, Maya.
Let's go make some friends.

46:08.112 --> 46:10.348
Hello, everyone.

46:10.448 --> 46:13.117
How are y'all doin' today?
- Rats!

46:13.216 --> 46:16.661
I think last time we started off on the
wrong foot. Let's start off fresh, shall we?

46:20.577 --> 46:24.497
You have foiled my poop bomb.
I am most impressed.

46:24.597 --> 46:28.299
Horacio, I know you miss
your girlfriends back in Venezuela.

46:28.398 --> 46:30.567
Yes. This is true.

46:30.667 --> 46:34.304
You're feeling lonely because you're the only
Amazon parrot within a hundred-mile radius.

46:34.404 --> 46:37.074
Yes. This, too, is true.

46:37.174 --> 46:40.980
You're feeling the pressure of having
to be exotic and colorful 24-7.

46:41.079 --> 46:43.213
You have seen
into my soul.

46:43.312 --> 46:45.234
Wait a second.
What's goin' on here?

46:49.973 --> 46:53.522
<i>Bruce, you're numbing out,
partying all the time</i>

46:53.622 --> 46:56.259
because you feel like, otherwise,
everybody's gonna think you're boring.

46:56.359 --> 46:59.265
Isn't that right?
- Crikey, you don't know what it's like...

46:59.365 --> 47:01.283
to be a party animal.

47:03.420 --> 47:05.602
And, Rosie, you like
gossiping all the time...

47:05.702 --> 47:09.007
because then you feel like
you're the center of attention.

47:09.107 --> 47:12.174
But you feel some deep shame
when it's all over, don't you?

47:12.274 --> 47:15.879
I just wanna be liked.
- I like you, mate.

47:15.978 --> 47:20.184
Yeah. We all think that you're
an amazing chinchilla, don't we?

47:20.284 --> 47:22.087
Don't we?
- I like you, Rosie.

47:22.186 --> 47:24.022
Me too.
- Me three.

47:24.122 --> 47:26.891
Hey, don't fall for this.
She's trying to trick you.

47:26.991 --> 47:29.958
And, Aldo, my
monkey friend...

47:30.058 --> 47:34.496
<i>I know you miss your carefree days
ofbeing in the alfresco markets of Italy</i>

47:34.596 --> 47:37.037
You're sad because you
miss your family back in Naples.

47:37.136 --> 47:41.603
<i>You miss your papa's red wine
and your sweet grandmama's cannoli</i>

47:41.703 --> 47:44.240
Ah, sweet grandmama.

47:44.340 --> 47:46.342
I am not Aldo or Italian.

47:46.441 --> 47:50.264
I do not even have a grandmama.
L- It's me, Maya, your Monkey!

47:52.502 --> 47:54.719
Oh, I know, Monkey. And I'm so sorry.

47:54.818 --> 47:57.968
<i>And I'll never
leave you again, okay?</i>

48:02.713 --> 48:07.134
Off you go.
- That is so beautiful.

48:07.233 --> 48:11.017
Anteater? Come on. Blow.

48:13.490 --> 48:16.572
Come on, you guys. Get it together.

48:16.672 --> 48:21.778
<i>Repeat after me:
"This is very, very good"</i>

48:21.878 --> 48:25.184
This is very,
very... good.

48:25.283 --> 48:29.352
See? Now how does that feel?
- It feels very, very... good!

48:29.452 --> 48:33.326
<i>You seem all right, girlie Why would
you want to send Daisy to the pound?</i>

48:33.425 --> 48:36.627
What? The pound? Where would
you get a crazy idea like that?

48:36.727 --> 48:39.599
I'll give you one guess.

48:39.698 --> 48:41.548
Aha!

48:43.020 --> 48:45.337
<i>I'm outta here.
- Ay, Daisy, please</i>

48:45.437 --> 48:47.340
<i>Don't go
- Daisy, come back</i>

48:47.440 --> 48:49.619
<i>Oh, and I was
just starting to feel good</i>

48:51.061 --> 48:54.847
<i>What am I gonna do? The
prince is gonna be here in two days</i>

48:54.946 --> 48:58.379
I just don't understand
why Daisy's behaving this way.

48:58.479 --> 49:00.718
There must be something
I'm missing, but what?

49:00.818 --> 49:03.054
<i>Hello?</i>

49:03.154 --> 49:06.075
Hey, did you hear that?
- What is it, Lucky?

49:09.379 --> 49:12.495
Yeah. Yeah, I
can totally come.

49:12.594 --> 49:16.416
Clearwater Campground.
Okay. I'll be there.

49:38.008 --> 49:40.258
I can't see. What's she
doing? What's she doing?

49:40.358 --> 49:43.245
Something she
shouldn't be doing.

49:47.084 --> 49:49.518
<i>Just a second</i>

49:51.922 --> 49:54.706
Hey, Maya.
- Hey, can you do me a huge favor?

49:54.805 --> 49:59.421
Can you drive me somewhere? No questions asked.
- I would, but I don't have a car.

50:00.630 --> 50:04.247
Gotta be some wheels
around here somewhere.

50:04.346 --> 50:07.531
You know, we can probably find somethin'.
- Okay.

50:12.709 --> 50:14.689
Man, can you make
this thing go any faster?

50:14.789 --> 50:17.928
I'm already pedal
to the metal.

50:18.028 --> 50:21.712
This Clearwater Campground
has to be around here somewhere.

50:28.892 --> 50:31.122
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

50:54.651 --> 50:57.950
<i>That's great
- Where did you get that?</i>

51:08.832 --> 51:11.448
<i>Great. So now
you're following me?</i>

51:11.547 --> 51:14.955
It's bad enough I've got Secret Service on
my back. Now I've got the Dog Chatterer?

51:15.054 --> 51:17.552
Your dad would freak out
if he found out you were here...

51:17.652 --> 51:20.526
without Secret Service protection.
- I can take care of myself.

51:20.626 --> 51:24.862
<i>Yeah Right
- Wait a minute Now I know where I know you from</i>

51:24.962 --> 51:28.598
You're the president's freakin' daughter.
- What? No. No, I'm- I'm-

51:28.698 --> 51:31.638
Dude, dude! It's the
First freakin' Daughter, man.

51:31.737 --> 51:33.552
<i>Who's got a camera?
- No!</i>

51:35.525 --> 51:37.410
<i>Come on. Come on. One picture.
- No No pictures</i>

51:37.509 --> 51:39.845
She said, no pictures.

51:39.945 --> 51:43.114
Oh, and what are you gonna
do, huh? Call Secret Service?

51:43.213 --> 51:45.815
Ow!
- No, but I will.

51:45.915 --> 51:48.186
I think it's time to leave.

51:48.285 --> 51:51.286
He got served.
- Oh!

51:51.385 --> 51:54.659
<i>Cute
- How did you do that?</i>

51:54.758 --> 51:58.737
Fifteen years of tae
kwon do classes just paid off.

52:03.653 --> 52:07.054
I'll be right back. You
giris stay right here, okay?

52:19.436 --> 52:21.354
So...

52:21.454 --> 52:25.704
I suppose you think I'm a spoiled, ungrateful,
irresponsible brat.

52:27.177 --> 52:29.941
The thought
crossed my mind.

52:34.451 --> 52:37.336
You have no idea what it's like
to be the daughter...

52:37.436 --> 52:40.806
of a national hero- all the
expectations that are heaped on you-

52:40.906 --> 52:44.311
And you feel like you'll never be able to
measure up to your father's greatness-

52:44.410 --> 52:47.780
like you have to be perfect
all the time- so what's the point?

52:47.879 --> 52:50.059
Yes, exactly. How did-

52:51.134 --> 52:53.586
<i>Your father.
- That's right.</i>

52:53.686 --> 52:55.852
Dr. Dolittle,
beloved veterinarian.

52:55.952 --> 52:59.556
National hero.
- Mm-hmm.

52:59.655 --> 53:02.359
This past year I lost sight
of my priorities.

53:02.459 --> 53:05.331
I let my grades drop, blew off
my responsibilities...

53:05.430 --> 53:09.734
and completely screwed up
my college application.

53:09.834 --> 53:14.139
But I think the truth is,
I was afraid-

53:14.238 --> 53:18.476
afraid I wouldn't be able to live up
to my father's reputation.

53:18.576 --> 53:23.747
And comin' here helped me remember
what's important to me in my life...

53:23.847 --> 53:28.270
and that's the animals- even though I had
to mess up big-time to figure that out.

53:30.407 --> 53:32.657
It's just...

53:32.756 --> 53:36.128
he always expects me
to be perfect.

53:36.228 --> 53:38.361
Now do you really
believe that?

53:38.461 --> 53:41.929
Or is that just what you tell yourself
so you can stay mad at him?

53:42.029 --> 53:44.667
Your father is not perfect.

53:44.767 --> 53:47.870
He makes mistakes
just like everybody else.

53:47.970 --> 53:51.940
Did you know that he ran for class president and lost?
- No way.

53:52.039 --> 53:54.644
Way.

53:54.743 --> 53:56.649
So just give him a chance...

53:56.749 --> 53:59.964
and you'll realize that he
just wants what's best for you.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.093
<i>Not a word from
either one of you.</i>

54:11.192 --> 54:14.082
<i>No, pink's totally
your color</i>

54:19.889 --> 54:21.880
Come on.
Hop up here.

54:28.932 --> 54:31.162
Hey! Who's hungry?

54:31.368 --> 54:33.483
<i># You can't
see it coming #</i>

54:33.582 --> 54:36.618
<i># Until it's too late #</i>

54:36.718 --> 54:38.855
<i># You're struck
down by the hand of fate #</i>

54:38.954 --> 54:41.794
Hot fudge is comin' in here.

54:41.893 --> 54:44.527
<i># With or without #</i>

54:44.627 --> 54:47.549
<i>#And when you do it's always too late #
- Looks so good.</i>

54:49.819 --> 54:53.768
<i>#Ooh, it's all sunshine #
- Sprinkles.</i>

54:53.867 --> 54:57.473
<i>#Or it's all rain #
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

54:57.573 --> 55:00.324
<i>#Ooh, it's all sunshine ## -
Enough sprinkles! - Let's eat.</i>

55:02.098 --> 55:04.247
Gotta get some
whipped cream.

55:04.346 --> 55:06.719
Whoop!

55:06.818 --> 55:09.987
Oh, you think
that's funny, huh?

55:10.086 --> 55:11.991
That's funny? Uh, okay.

55:12.091 --> 55:14.509
Here.

55:15.879 --> 55:17.870
Whoa!

55:22.819 --> 55:27.037
Courtney, where have you been? We have
been looking everywhere for you.

55:27.137 --> 55:30.639
Well, I, uh-

55:30.738 --> 55:33.477
Uh, s-sir, it was...
all my fault.

55:33.577 --> 55:38.648
<i>I snuck out, and Courtney
followed me and Cole followed her</i>

55:38.747 --> 55:40.985
Maya, this is not
fun and games here.

55:41.085 --> 55:43.889
<i>The prince's visit
is in two days'time</i>

55:43.988 --> 55:48.557
and as far as I can see, Daisy is no farther
along than she was a week ago.

55:48.657 --> 55:54.000
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
- Make sure that it doesn't.

55:54.099 --> 55:57.212
Cole, we'll talk about this in the morning.
- Yes, sir.

55:58.355 --> 56:01.552
And your father wants
to see you immediately.

56:10.834 --> 56:13.686
<i>That was pretty cool of you back there,
takin'the hit for Courtney</i>

56:13.785 --> 56:18.089
That was pretty cool of you back at that party.
I don't know what we would have done without you.

56:18.189 --> 56:21.093
Yeah, well, I'm
glad I could help out.

56:21.193 --> 56:23.292
I've never seen Courtney
laugh like that.

56:23.392 --> 56:27.030
Yeah, I have a feeling things are gonna
start changing for the better.

56:27.130 --> 56:31.633
It's just the pressure of bein' the First Daughter.
- Who could blame her?

56:31.733 --> 56:35.737
Yeah. Now if only Daisy
was that simple to figure out.

56:35.836 --> 56:39.124
<i>Wait a minute.
Maybe Daisy is that simple.</i>

56:41.998 --> 56:45.918
I can't believe it. It's been right
under my nose the entire time.

56:46.018 --> 56:48.470
Oh, you are a genius!

56:49.539 --> 56:52.599
I... didn't...
say anything.

56:54.177 --> 56:56.042
<i>Daisy!</i>

56:58.181 --> 57:00.172
Daisy!

57:01.518 --> 57:04.268
Where could she have gone?

57:04.368 --> 57:06.345
Daisy!

57:12.495 --> 57:15.043
Daisy!

57:15.143 --> 57:17.449
Come on, girl.
Dais-

57:17.548 --> 57:21.685
Rosie, I have been looking for Daisy all
over the place. Have you heard anything?

57:21.784 --> 57:24.387
I might have heard a
few things, but I can't say.

57:24.486 --> 57:28.591
What? Why not?
- I gave up gossiping. I am a changed chinchilla.

57:28.691 --> 57:31.462
Rosie, that's not gossiping.
That's helping out a friend.

57:31.562 --> 57:33.764
Hmm.

57:33.864 --> 57:37.770
Here. I think we should conclude
with this paragraph right here.

57:37.870 --> 57:40.306
You guys, Daisy's gone.
She ran away.

57:40.406 --> 57:42.842
What?
Well, let's go find her.

57:42.942 --> 57:46.745
Cole, we have a presentation
due in two hours for the chief of staff.

57:46.845 --> 57:49.012
It's just a dog.

57:49.111 --> 57:52.782
Just a dog? You know what? If that's really
what you think, then I feel sorry for you.

57:52.882 --> 57:57.155
<i>And I hate to break it to you, but some things
are more important than your career</i>

57:57.254 --> 57:59.231
Come on, Maya.

58:01.244 --> 58:04.495
There's Courtney!
Courtney! Courtney!

58:04.595 --> 58:08.265
I've been looking for Daisy everywhere and
none of the other animals have seen her either.

58:08.364 --> 58:10.331
<i>I think she ran away</i>

58:10.431 --> 58:12.400
What?
- I can't find her anywhere.

58:12.500 --> 58:16.858
Don't worry. We'll help you find her.
- Let's go this way.

58:22.932 --> 58:25.013
Okay. Bruce,
you head out north.

58:25.113 --> 58:27.019
Horacio, Monkey,
you guys go south.

58:27.119 --> 58:30.422
Chinchilla, keep your ear to
the ground. Lucky, you're with us.

58:30.521 --> 58:33.156
Leave no stone unturned.
We've got to find this dog.

58:33.256 --> 58:36.826
Yes. We go south! I have
no idea which way is south.

58:36.925 --> 58:40.530
Follow me. One thing
this bird's got is G.P.S.

58:40.629 --> 58:42.467
You got it, baby.
- Game on!

58:42.567 --> 58:44.713
Okay. Let's go.

58:50.593 --> 58:53.743
Hey. Mind if I tag along?

58:53.843 --> 58:56.682
I figured you could use
all the help you could get.

58:56.781 --> 58:59.280
Thanks.

58:59.380 --> 59:02.153
Come on.

59:02.252 --> 59:04.455
<i>Daisy!</i>

59:04.554 --> 59:06.825
Daisy! - Daisy!
- Here, girl!

59:06.924 --> 59:08.844
Daisy, come on!

59:11.614 --> 59:13.932
Daisy! -
Daisy! - Daisy!

59:14.031 --> 59:16.497
We've been looking
for hours. It's no use.

59:16.597 --> 59:19.419
There's a thousand acres here.
She could be anywhere.

59:31.134 --> 59:34.053
Anything, Lucky?
- Mm-mmm.

59:34.153 --> 59:38.620
Reporting in from units two
and three. No sign of the pooch.

59:38.719 --> 59:41.756
Courtney, is there anywhere
she would have gone?

59:41.856 --> 59:44.696
A special place,
somethin' like that? Think hard.

59:44.796 --> 59:47.341
I don't know.
I don't know.

59:48.418 --> 59:51.182
Wait.
I have an idea.

59:56.059 --> 59:59.051
We used to play here
all the time when I was a kid.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.448
There she is!
- Wait.

01:00:02.548 --> 01:00:04.950
Can I have a minute
alone with her?

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:07.798
Come on. Trust me.

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:14.169
Okay. We'll meet you
back at the ranch.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:24.081
Hey, girl.
- Go away.

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:32.475
Daisy, I know it's a lot of
pressure being the First Dog.

01:00:32.574 --> 01:00:36.448
You can rebel all you want, but you can't
run away from who you are. None of us can.

01:00:36.548 --> 01:00:39.013
I just want things to be
the way they used to be.

01:00:39.112 --> 01:00:41.284
When he was governor,
we were a family.

01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:46.258
<i>We would spend time together, play fetch,
go jogging, but now everything's changed</i>

01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:50.859
It's always the cameras, meetings, events,
and I'm just a political prop.

01:00:50.958 --> 01:00:53.399
You are so much more
than that, Daisy.

01:00:53.499 --> 01:00:56.335
You are an inspiration
to the people of this country.

01:00:56.434 --> 01:00:59.535
And there's not many animals
or people who can even say that.

01:00:59.634 --> 01:01:01.540
I don't want to be
an inspiration.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.510
I just want to be...
a dog.

01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:07.946
Daisy, come here. Come here.

01:01:08.046 --> 01:01:10.693
Come here, girl.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:15.754
<i>You are a dog-
an amazing dog-</i>

01:01:15.854 --> 01:01:18.791
and you have a family
that loves you very much.

01:01:18.891 --> 01:01:23.391
But the thing is, every family has its own
set of problems, its frustrations...

01:01:23.491 --> 01:01:26.899
and we're always wishing
that things were different.

01:01:26.999 --> 01:01:31.100
But what if, instead of
running away from who we are...

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.105
we just started
embracing it.

01:01:33.205 --> 01:01:36.181
You're right, Maya.
You're right.

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:43.177
You sure they're gonna be
all right out there?

01:01:43.277 --> 01:01:45.325
I think we have
to trust her, Dad.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.100
Hey, hey,
look, everyone!

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:54.560
Oh, Daisy!

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.306
<i>Come on! Come on, girl</i>

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.997
Daisy! Come on.
- Oh, good girl.

01:02:01.097 --> 01:02:03.002
Yeah.

01:02:03.102 --> 01:02:07.906
Don't you ever run away like that again.
You scared the daylights out of us.

01:02:08.005 --> 01:02:12.175
I think Daisy is finally ready to talk,
if you guys are ready to listen.

01:02:12.274 --> 01:02:16.527
Come on, girl. I've got
your favorite treats inside.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:22.017
Courtney and I also had a talk this morning.
- Oh?

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:27.122
She told me everything: About the party,
about how you covered for her.

01:02:27.221 --> 01:02:31.597
Gave us an opportunity for our first
really good talk in a long time...

01:02:31.697 --> 01:02:33.599
thanks to you, Maya.

01:02:33.699 --> 01:02:35.764
I'm glad I could help.

01:02:35.864 --> 01:02:38.400
Excellent work, Maya.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.390
All right, everybody, we have
a state dinner to prepare for.

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:54.817
<i># Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa #</i>

01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:59.488
<i>#Someday #
- #I'll buy an old car #</i>

01:02:59.587 --> 01:03:03.996
<i>#Mmm #
- #Someday #</i>

01:03:04.096 --> 01:03:07.663
<i>#I'll get that car to start #
- #Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh #</i>

01:03:07.762 --> 01:03:12.137
<i>#Someday #
- #I'll learn how to drive too #</i>

01:03:12.237 --> 01:03:15.405
<i>#Mm-hmm and
then someday #</i>

01:03:15.504 --> 01:03:19.310
<i>#Imagine all
the things I could do #</i>

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.815
<i># Whoo #
- #Someday #</i>

01:03:22.915 --> 01:03:26.847
<i>#I'll get that car to start #
- #Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh #</i>

01:03:26.947 --> 01:03:29.017
<i>#Someday #</i>

01:03:29.117 --> 01:03:31.889
<i>#I'll learn
how to drive too #</i>

01:03:31.988 --> 01:03:34.055
<i># Yes, I will now
And then someday #</i>

01:03:34.155 --> 01:03:36.873
<i>#Imagine all the
things I could do ##</i>

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:06.289
Your Highness,
thank you for coming.

01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:09.126
It's my great pleasure
to welcome you to Sterling Ranch.

01:04:09.225 --> 01:04:12.395
Mr. President,
it is indeed my pleasure.

01:04:12.495 --> 01:04:15.800
I look forward to a fruitful
and productive visit.

01:04:15.899 --> 01:04:20.435
You must be tired from your travels.
My staff will show you to your quarters...

01:04:20.535 --> 01:04:22.908
and I look forward to seeing you
this evening at the dinner.

01:04:23.007 --> 01:04:25.586
Thank you,
Mr. President.

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.900
We've got our work
cut out for us.

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:55.153
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, please rise</i>

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.016
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
His Royal Highness</i>

01:05:08.115 --> 01:05:10.504
<i>Rrince Tharoor
of Kalampore</i>

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:18.861
Your Highness, welcome.
- Mr. President.

01:05:18.961 --> 01:05:22.266
May I present my
daughter, Courtney.

01:05:22.366 --> 01:05:24.842
My daughter,
Amina.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:29.239
I'm so nervous.

01:05:29.338 --> 01:05:33.728
It'll be fine. You've done everything you can.
- It's gonna go great.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:41.320
Hi, Maya! Hey, it's us.
- Ay, beautiful fiesta.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.586
I wanna go. I wanna go.
I wanna go!

01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:47.390
Put a cork in it, Bonzo.
It's a people party.

01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:50.058
Alas, my life story.

01:05:50.158 --> 01:05:53.013
And now, the First Dog,
Daisy.

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:58.236
Where is she?
Where is she?

01:05:58.336 --> 01:06:00.881
<i>Oh! There she is
- There she is</i>

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.864
We are pleased
to meet you, Daisy.

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:19.038
<i>The Kalampore
National Anthem.</i>

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:27.943
She's so cute.

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:41.427
Hold on.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.450
Yes?

01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:51.018
Everything's under control.

01:06:51.117 --> 01:06:56.894
I have something that'll make those bad oysters
I gave him in Kalampore seem like high tea.

01:06:56.994 --> 01:07:00.745
After tonight, there's no way
the prince will sign that agreement.

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:06.303
The only document
linking me to this deal...

01:07:06.403 --> 01:07:08.673
is locked in a safe
in my office.

01:07:08.772 --> 01:07:13.207
I assure you, Mr. Dunsmore,
that rain forest is history...

01:07:13.306 --> 01:07:16.787
and you and I are
going to be very rich.

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.916
Oh, no. Oh, no,
the chief is a rat!

01:07:22.016 --> 01:07:23.984
I gotta do somethin'.
I gotta tell somebody.

01:07:24.084 --> 01:07:27.391
<i>Oh, if only I could leave
this house, but I can't!</i>

01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:30.558
All right. Okay, if I leave this house,
what's the worst thing that's gonna happen?

01:07:30.658 --> 01:07:32.997
<i>Okay, people will think
that spring is early</i>

01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:36.563
<i>But I'm not the only groundhog.
It's not all on my shoulders.</i>

01:07:36.663 --> 01:07:39.200
<i>And the rain forest
The rain forest is at sta-</i>

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.173
But there are
other rain forests.

01:07:41.272 --> 01:07:45.216
<i>I can't stand-I've gotta go!
I'm goin'! Stand back!</i>

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:52.290
I did it! I'm goin'! I'm goin'!
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:58.521
This is a wonderful night,
Mr. President.

01:07:58.621 --> 01:08:02.725
Your family is lovely. This
place, the animals- so inspiring.

01:08:02.824 --> 01:08:05.427
Well, I hope we managed to convey
to you how sorry we were-

01:08:05.527 --> 01:08:08.630
Back home we say, "However
long the night, the day will break."

01:08:08.729 --> 01:08:12.084
Ah.
- That is in the past. We must work to the future.

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:22.524
<i>Rsst Maya Maya!</i>

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.265
<i>Under the table</i>

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:36.060
Hey, you left your house. Congratulations.
What are you doin' here?

01:08:36.158 --> 01:08:38.078
We got a big problem.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:45.166
This is terrible.
Are you sure about this?

01:08:45.265 --> 01:08:48.246
You think that I would've left
my house if I wasn't sure?

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:53.640
Okay. Well, round up all the
animals. I think I have a plan.

01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:55.647
Oh, by the way,
can you whistle?

01:08:55.747 --> 01:08:59.179
Nope.

01:08:59.278 --> 01:09:01.349
Groundhogs talk to
each other by whistling.

01:09:01.448 --> 01:09:03.354
You're not a groundhog.
You're a prairie dog.

01:09:03.455 --> 01:09:07.341
Prairie do- Oh, no. Now
I'm having an identity crisis.

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:15.801
So, tell me again your
thoughts on my rain forest.

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:19.616
How might we come together on this issue?
- Oh, I'm so glad you asked me.

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:25.843
<i>Everybody understand the plan?
- Are you sure about this, Maya?</i>

01:09:25.943 --> 01:09:28.544
If this goes wrong, you
could get in serious trouble.

01:09:28.643 --> 01:09:30.611
That's just a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:32.881
<i>Okay You guys get
the evidence from the safe</i>

01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:35.185
I'll make sure
the president doesn't eat.

01:09:35.283 --> 01:09:37.520
Good luck.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.836
<i>Hey, shouldn't we
synchronize our watches?</i>

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:55.981
Hey, where have you been?
- Oh, um, l-I'll tell you later.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.998
<i>?Ay, Dios mío!</i>

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.406
Ha-ha!

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.661
<i>Got it!</i>

01:10:21.761 --> 01:10:25.584
Let's go! Shh!

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:30.455
Nothing here?

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:38.848
Nope.
Nothin' in here.

01:10:38.947 --> 01:10:43.085
Nothing here.
- Zilch-a-roonie here.

01:10:43.185 --> 01:10:46.300
Hey, guys. I found it!
- Ha-ha!

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.716
<i>Incoming!</i>

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:21.992
<i>Someone's on me tail!</i>

01:11:22.092 --> 01:11:24.929
<i>Watch it, buster I am
not that kind of chinchilla</i>

01:11:25.029 --> 01:11:29.075
<i>Shh Everyone be quiet</i>

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:34.805
<i>Monkey, where's your tail?
- Uh-oh!</i>

01:11:34.905 --> 01:11:39.617
<i>Ooh, la, la</i>

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:49.450
<i>Back to work, everyone!
- Go, Monkey, go!</i>

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:51.836
Now, where was I?

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.180
Ladies and gentlemen-

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.802
First of all,
I wish to say...

01:12:06.902 --> 01:12:10.174
I appreciate all that you
have done, Mr. President...

01:12:10.273 --> 01:12:15.377
for the global environment and for
making this such a wonderful night.

01:12:15.477 --> 01:12:18.729
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:26.057
<i>And I want to
announce at this time</i>

01:12:26.156 --> 01:12:28.075
I will sign the agreement.

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:37.308
Your Highness,
thank you.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.607
<i>And I would like
to propose a toast</i>

01:12:43.706 --> 01:12:45.610
To His Highness,
Prince Tharoor...

01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:48.720
and to a long and fruitful collaboration
between our two countries.

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:53.647
And to President Sterling...

01:12:53.747 --> 01:12:57.420
for going so far to arrange
this wonderful night.

01:12:57.519 --> 01:13:01.224
You are a most generous host.
- I thank you.

01:13:01.323 --> 01:13:05.007
<i>To the president.
- Cheers</i>

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.780
And now, dinner is served.

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.938
A little more to the left.

01:13:15.038 --> 01:13:17.205
<i>A little more.
Roquito mas</i>

01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:21.410
Keep going.
Keep going- Stop!

01:13:21.509 --> 01:13:25.058
You're loving me for the ears
right now, aren't you?

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:43.768
Stop!

01:13:43.868 --> 01:13:47.549
Uh, hi, Your Highness.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:52.839
I'm sorry. Your Highness,
this is Maya Dolittle.

01:13:52.939 --> 01:13:56.078
Ah! Yes, yes, yes.

01:13:56.178 --> 01:14:00.586
Your father's reputation
is truly worid renowned. Mmm.

01:14:00.685 --> 01:14:03.555
Thank you.

01:14:03.654 --> 01:14:07.958
Oh, l-I'd-

01:14:08.058 --> 01:14:11.058
Was there something
you wanted to say, Maya?

01:14:11.157 --> 01:14:13.626
No. I mean, yes.

01:14:13.726 --> 01:14:16.764
<i>Um, I would like
to just tell a joke</i>

01:14:16.863 --> 01:14:19.468
It's an American tradition:
Joke before dinner.

01:14:19.567 --> 01:14:21.507
<i>Maya-
- So</i>

01:14:21.606 --> 01:14:25.639
Why do cows wear bells?

01:14:25.739 --> 01:14:29.012
Because their
horns don't work!

01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:32.483
You get it? 'Cause the
horns go, "beep, beep"-

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:34.582
Uh-huh.

01:14:34.681 --> 01:14:36.954
<i>Stop! Okay,
back to the right</i>

01:14:37.053 --> 01:14:38.957
<i>The other right!</i>

01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:41.859
Okay. So there
were two fish in a tank.

01:14:41.959 --> 01:14:43.924
And one fish says
to the other fish...

01:14:44.023 --> 01:14:46.161
"Do you know how
to drive this thing?"

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.532
'Cause they're in a tank.
You get it? 'Cause-

01:14:48.631 --> 01:14:50.597
Yeah. I really-
I love that one.

01:14:50.697 --> 01:14:52.604
<i>Maya?
- Hmm?</i>

01:14:52.704 --> 01:14:55.939
Thank you.
- But l-

01:14:56.038 --> 01:14:58.775
Maya, thank you.

01:14:58.874 --> 01:15:01.443
Yes, sir.

01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:04.055
Well, folks,
let's eat.

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:17.862
Mmm.

01:15:17.962 --> 01:15:22.144
You okay?
- I guess so.

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:27.237
Excuse me for one moment, Mr. President.
- Mmm.

01:15:27.336 --> 01:15:29.741
I must confer with my adviser
about our agreement.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.589
Of course.

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:44.235
To the left, and... stop! That's it.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.374
<i>Go, Rarrot, go!</i>

01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:51.760
<i>Gotcha.
- Ha-ha!</i>

01:15:51.859 --> 01:15:53.838
Missión accomplished.

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:59.076
<i>Got it.
- Go, dog, go! Vaya con Dios.</i>

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:08.861
I feel weird.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:22.472
Wait a second. It wasn't the
president's food. It was Daisy's!

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:45.593
<i>Get this dog off of me! Now!
- Your Highness!</i>

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:53.306
You have insulted Prince Tharoor
for the last time. The deal is off!

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:58.894
Your Highness, please-
- I said, the deal is off!

01:16:58.993 --> 01:17:01.697
We are leaving.

01:17:01.797 --> 01:17:05.602
<i>Your Highness-</i>

01:17:05.702 --> 01:17:08.520
Wait! Stop!

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:15.413
Chief Dorion is responsible
for everything.

01:17:15.512 --> 01:17:17.511
<i>He spiked Daisy's food tonight</i>

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:20.830
and he was the one who gave the
president bad oysters in Kalampore.

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:24.820
What? That's-
That's ridiculous.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.158
<i>This is just a sad and pathetic attempt to
cover up your own incompetence, Miss Dolittle</i>

01:17:29.258 --> 01:17:32.428
Secret Service, get her out of here.
- Harold, let's hear her out.

01:17:32.527 --> 01:17:35.433
Sir, really, l-
- Harold.

01:17:35.533 --> 01:17:38.998
He doesn't want you and the prince
to sign the agreement.

01:17:39.098 --> 01:17:41.539
He's been trying to sabotage
the entire thing.

01:17:41.639 --> 01:17:44.171
That's preposterous.
- It's the truth!

01:17:44.271 --> 01:17:49.614
The groundhog overheard you on your cell phone tonight.
- The groundhog?

01:17:49.713 --> 01:17:53.146
Well, he's a prairie dog
who thinks he's a groundhog.

01:17:53.245 --> 01:17:57.988
So, your alleged proof
of this outrageous story...

01:17:58.087 --> 01:18:01.907
is the word of a prairie dog
who thinks he's a groundhog?

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:05.196
<i>Secret Service, please</i>

01:18:05.296 --> 01:18:08.396
Maya.

01:18:08.495 --> 01:18:10.508
I'm sorry I disappointed you,
Mr. President.

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:18.073
<i>Woof! Woof! Beg your
pardon Dog savin'the day</i>

01:18:18.173 --> 01:18:20.708
Comin' through. Make way.
Great dress, lady.

01:18:20.808 --> 01:18:23.230
<i>Comin'through here
- Come on.</i>

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:29.563
Sorry about the saliva.

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:36.089
Hmm. Actually, it's the word
of a prairie dog...

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:38.096
and... these.

01:18:38.196 --> 01:18:42.196
These documents show that
Chief Dorion is a silent partner...

01:18:42.295 --> 01:18:44.432
in Boyd and Dunsmore
Investment Group.

01:18:44.532 --> 01:18:50.014
<i>And he stands to make millions
if the rain forest is developed</i>

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.445
Where did you get
those documents?

01:18:54.545 --> 01:18:59.626
Harold, I would get
a very expensive lawyer.

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.762
I never did
like that man.

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:09.202
<i>The only thing I hate more
than animals is teenagers!</i>

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:19.801
<i>Miss Dolittle,
I cannot thank you enough</i>

01:19:19.901 --> 01:19:23.640
<i>You have brought the people of
Kalampore and United States together</i>

01:19:23.739 --> 01:19:27.943
You are truly a hero.
- Thank you.

01:19:28.043 --> 01:19:30.313
I wanted to change the worid
before I was 30.

01:19:30.412 --> 01:19:32.749
She's changed it
before she's even 20.

01:19:32.849 --> 01:19:34.915
You were so brave.

01:19:35.015 --> 01:19:37.904
I barely got out with my life,
but it was worth it.

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:42.407
Who has got a pen?

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:48.127
We have an agreement to sign.

01:19:48.226 --> 01:19:51.265
<i>Way to go, Maya!</i>

01:19:51.364 --> 01:19:53.637
<i>Maya, you did it!</i>

01:19:53.736 --> 01:19:56.804
We gotta kick this party up a notch.
- Leave it to the Monkey.

01:19:56.904 --> 01:19:59.087
It's funky monkey time.

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.626
<i>Everybody get down!</i>

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:08.851

Huh.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:05.550
"The president
