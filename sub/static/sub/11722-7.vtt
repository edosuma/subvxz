<i>The Secret Circle...</i>

00:01.880 --> 00:04.716
My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,

00:04.717 --> 00:06.050
and for that I am so sorry.

00:06.118 --> 00:07.502
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:07.586 --> 00:09.838
but destiny's not easy
to run from.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.122
Hi. I'm Diana.

00:11.173 --> 00:12.640
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.

00:12.725 --> 00:14.309
- We're different.
- You're different.

00:14.393 --> 00:17.929
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.

00:17.980 --> 00:20.081
Here we have
real power now.

00:20.149 --> 00:21.816
A complete circle is 6.

00:21.901 --> 00:22.817
You complete
the circle.

00:22.902 --> 00:24.269
She's got the gift.

00:24.336 --> 00:26.654
You can get Cassie
to do what we need?

00:26.722 --> 00:29.058
The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.

00:29.442 --> 00:31.362
There was a guy in
Nick's yard last night.

00:31.438 --> 00:32.955
It must have been
his older brother Jake.

00:33.006 --> 00:33.956
He left town
a couple of years ago.

00:34.007 --> 00:35.558
He was
a troubled young man.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.626
- What do you want?
- Your blood.

00:39.596 --> 00:41.230
Aah!
Get off of her.

00:41.298 --> 00:43.182
We did a spell together to send
her away.

00:43.267 --> 00:44.433
So, you know
you're a witch.

00:44.485 --> 00:47.019
Your dad told me
about you and Cassie

00:47.104 --> 00:48.905
being destined
to be together.

00:48.972 --> 00:50.573
I've been standing on
the sidelines

00:50.640 --> 00:52.074
watching it
since she got here.

00:52.142 --> 00:53.493
I can't do that anymore.

00:53.577 --> 00:56.478
I've come here to rid
Chance Harbor of witches,

00:56.530 --> 00:58.831
and I will not fail.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.728
What do you think?

01:28.730 --> 01:30.396
Those are
ancient artifacts,

01:30.480 --> 01:31.981
not a Halloween costume.

01:32.032 --> 01:34.951
Whatever. I'm
a sexy witch Doctor.

01:35.018 --> 01:36.152
Take it off.

01:36.203 --> 01:38.070
We shouldn't be drawing
attention to ourselves.

01:38.155 --> 01:39.521
Relax, it's Halloween.

01:39.573 --> 01:40.623
We're just
blending in

01:40.690 --> 01:42.542
with all the supernatural
wannabes.

01:42.626 --> 01:44.660
And is there
a more perfect place

01:44.711 --> 01:45.745
for party decorations?

01:45.829 --> 01:48.331
Uh, no, we're
not having a party.

01:48.382 --> 01:50.132
Just a get-together.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.133
That was the deal.

01:51.201 --> 01:53.135
My grandmother's
only gone for the night.

01:53.203 --> 01:55.922
I know. And I'm impressed
that you agreed

01:56.006 --> 01:59.041
without me having
to resort to blackmail.

01:59.092 --> 02:02.544
No, I just-- I think it'll be
a good break for us.

02:02.596 --> 02:04.931
Halloween's the night to pretend
you're someone else, right?

02:05.015 --> 02:06.315
Sluttier versions
of someone else,

02:06.383 --> 02:07.716
but I get
your point.

02:07.768 --> 02:09.852
And maybe it'll be good
for Adam and Diana.

02:09.902 --> 02:12.021
Is that what
this is about?

02:12.072 --> 02:14.106
You feel bad about
breaking them up,

02:14.191 --> 02:15.391
and now, you're
throwing a party

02:15.442 --> 02:16.776
to lure them
back together?

02:16.860 --> 02:18.727
No, I did not
break them up.

02:18.779 --> 02:20.696
I think that the best way
to cover up the fact

02:20.747 --> 02:22.365
that you tried to
steal her boyfriend

02:22.416 --> 02:24.200
is to get
one of your own.

02:25.752 --> 02:26.702
How about Luke?

02:26.753 --> 02:27.920
I--pfft! No.

02:28.005 --> 02:29.255
I blew my chance
when I became

02:29.339 --> 02:31.573
the world's worst
dance date.

02:31.625 --> 02:33.042
Ecch.

02:33.093 --> 02:34.377
Luke.

02:34.428 --> 02:35.411
Hi.

02:35.462 --> 02:37.746
So, Cassie's having
a party tonight,

02:37.798 --> 02:39.215
and she would love
for you to come.

02:39.266 --> 02:42.051
No, it is just
a--a get-together.

02:42.102 --> 02:43.886
And I totally understand
if you don't want to,

02:43.937 --> 02:47.523
or if you have
other, better plans.

02:47.590 --> 02:48.774
Sure.

02:48.859 --> 02:49.692
Ok.

02:49.776 --> 02:52.028
So, I'll see you tonight?

02:52.095 --> 02:53.646
See you then.

02:56.149 --> 02:58.701
And now, you have
a hot guy to flirt with

02:58.768 --> 02:59.785
at the party.

02:59.853 --> 03:02.622
Done.

03:02.706 --> 03:03.990
So what about you?

03:04.074 --> 03:05.658
I have
a target in mind.

03:05.742 --> 03:08.828
- Jake?
- Maybe.

03:08.912 --> 03:11.330
Let me change out
of these artifacts.

03:11.415 --> 03:13.449
Will you buy
this for me?

03:13.500 --> 03:15.835
As a reward for
being so helpful?

03:15.919 --> 03:17.553
Um, hmm.

03:22.309 --> 03:24.644
Hi. Happy
Halloween.

03:24.728 --> 03:25.895
Mm-hmm.

03:29.632 --> 03:31.267
Thank you.

03:33.003 --> 03:34.770
Blake?

03:34.821 --> 03:36.939
Any relation
to Amelia Blake?

03:36.990 --> 03:38.607
She was my mother.

03:41.611 --> 03:42.978
Well.

Wilson's.

04:00.957 --> 04:03.559
It's been there
as long as I can remember.

04:03.626 --> 04:06.061
The guy who owns the place
seemed to know me.

04:06.128 --> 04:07.896
Or at least
knew mom.

04:07.964 --> 04:10.015
Calvin Wilson.

04:10.099 --> 04:11.517
Is he one of us?

04:11.601 --> 04:14.019
A witch?

04:14.103 --> 04:16.355
Yes. Why, did he
say something to you?

04:16.439 --> 04:18.690
No. I touched his hand
by mistake,

04:18.774 --> 04:20.504
and then, the mirror
behind him shattered.

04:20.529 --> 04:21.728
It was really strange.

04:21.945 --> 04:25.197
Residual power
and active power crossing.

04:25.281 --> 04:26.949
It could've just been
a random surge.

04:27.016 --> 04:30.151
How many witches are there in
Chance Harbor?

04:30.203 --> 04:32.588
Hard to know exactly.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.339
People tend to be
private about it.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.259
But a lot less than
there used to be.

04:37.326 --> 04:38.660
After the fire, everyone stopped
practicing.

04:38.711 --> 04:39.761
Many families left town.

04:39.829 --> 04:41.847
Right. Like us.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.533
I'd better get going
to Henry's lake house.

04:46.558 --> 04:47.758
It's a long drive.

04:48.471 --> 04:50.889
You sure you're going
to be ok here?

04:50.974 --> 04:52.474
Absolutely.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.944
Henry's an elder,
isn't he?

04:56.012 --> 04:57.479
Well, I just thought that you
didn't want to tell anyone

04:57.530 --> 05:00.566
that we'd bound the circle,
especially elders.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.868
I'm not going to tell
him about the circle.

05:02.952 --> 05:05.237
But I haven't heard
from him in weeks,

05:05.321 --> 05:07.072
and I'm worried.

05:07.156 --> 05:09.491
You have friends coming to stay
with you here, right?

05:09.542 --> 05:10.909
Yeah.
All the girls will be here.

05:10.994 --> 05:12.794
We're going to do
a low-key Halloween thing,

05:12.862 --> 05:14.271
like hand out candy
to trick-or-treaters

05:14.296 --> 05:15.496
and watch some movies.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.032
Good.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.218
Bye, grandma.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.481
Morning.

05:32.548 --> 05:36.217
Thought you'd still
be sleeping it off.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.404
I'm fine.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.224
The keys to the boathouse
weren't on the hook.

05:42.292 --> 05:44.443
You forget to put them back,
I guess.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.065
Sorry about that.

05:50.116 --> 05:53.902
And I appreciate the concern,
but I'm fine.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.588
Do you remember that
Diana broke up with me

05:56.673 --> 05:59.274
'cause you told her how Cassie
and I were written in the stars?

05:59.342 --> 06:01.510
I know it's hard
to understand.

06:01.577 --> 06:03.595
No,
I understand perfectly.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.121
Since you've already ruined
your life,

06:05.146 --> 06:06.431
you've decided
to destroy mine.

06:11.420 --> 06:13.188
That's not fair.

06:13.256 --> 06:16.191
Diana loved me.

06:16.258 --> 06:19.194
And the more I tried
to be worthy of it,

06:19.261 --> 06:22.147
the better I got, and the
further I got from being you.

06:29.405 --> 06:33.825
I don't want you to
be me either. Trust me.

06:33.910 --> 06:35.730
But messing with fate
will get you there

06:35.755 --> 06:37.081
faster than you know.

06:37.113 --> 06:39.143
Please stop using fate
as an excuse for what

06:39.168 --> 06:40.368
you did to mom.

06:41.084 --> 06:42.283
Did you ever
even love her?

06:42.335 --> 06:45.504
'Cause the way
you talk about Amelia,

06:45.588 --> 06:48.006
it doesn't seem like it.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.310
You got a lot
of great stuff.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.312
Thanks for coming over
to help set up.

06:53.396 --> 06:55.597
No problem.
I love Halloween.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.683
And I could use
the distraction.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.768
Have you and Adam talked
at all since the wake?

06:59.819 --> 07:01.737
No.

07:01.804 --> 07:03.822
I wish I could help somehow--

07:03.906 --> 07:04.823
I don't even want
to talk about it.

07:04.907 --> 07:05.907
I shouldn't have
brought it up.

07:05.975 --> 07:08.160
Oh, of course. Sorry.

07:08.244 --> 07:11.436
Ok. I know there's
a big bag of plastic cups

07:11.461 --> 07:12.661
somewhere in here.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.199
What is that?

07:14.283 --> 07:15.751
Uh, zombie?

07:15.818 --> 07:17.318
Got it from
the drama club.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.537
This is just
the beginning.

07:18.621 --> 07:20.339
There's
a trunkload of stuff.

07:20.423 --> 07:22.991
Faye invited them so they'd let
us take as much as we wanted.

07:26.929 --> 07:27.879
Oh, my God.

07:27.964 --> 07:30.298
What's wrong?

07:34.003 --> 07:36.888
This is part of the blade
that girl used to attack me.

07:36.973 --> 07:38.223
It must have broken off.

07:38.307 --> 07:40.192
It looks old.

07:40.276 --> 07:42.861
That's the Crescent moon symbol
she burned in the ground.

07:52.822 --> 07:54.289
Hey.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.826
Happy Halloween.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.163
First one as a witch,
very important.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.364
Yes. Thanks.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.133
Uh, I found something.

08:05.201 --> 08:06.668
What is it?

08:06.719 --> 08:09.638
It's a piece of the weapon
that girl used to attack me.

08:09.705 --> 08:11.372
Found it in the kitchen.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.592
Where are you taking it?

08:13.676 --> 08:16.395
Just the antiquities shop
by the boardwalk.

08:16.479 --> 08:18.146
Thought I'd try
to figure out what it is

08:18.214 --> 08:19.398
and what these
two symbols mean.

08:19.482 --> 08:20.982
You sure that's
a good idea?

08:21.050 --> 08:22.383
It might tip off
who you really are.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.485
And that witch is gone,

08:23.552 --> 08:26.154
so there's not much
to do about it, anyway.

08:26.222 --> 08:27.722
I told you
the night she died

08:27.774 --> 08:29.908
that there's too much
I don't know about witchcraft.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.276
It's time I learned.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.395
I don't want us to be
sitting targets anymore.

08:34.447 --> 08:38.082
I get that.

08:42.004 --> 08:45.123
I'll be careful about
what I tell him. Don't worry.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.574
Let me know how it goes.

08:50.412 --> 08:52.130
I'll see you later?

09:19.242 --> 09:22.744
Sorry,
I'm closed for lunch.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.080
Thought I locked up.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.199
You did.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.135
Calvin Wilson, right?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.220
That's right.

09:32.288 --> 09:33.705
I made
a couple of calls

09:33.773 --> 09:35.724
and found out that
the Wilsons have been

09:35.791 --> 09:37.559
around this area
forever.

09:37.626 --> 09:38.727
A long time.

09:38.794 --> 09:40.729
Maybe you knew
my parents?

09:40.796 --> 09:42.597
Richard
and Sara Armstrong?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.449
No.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.953
I didn't really know
them, either.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.356
I was pretty young
when they died.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.458
I'm sorry.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.877
Me, too.

09:55.945 --> 09:58.479
But that's not
why I came here.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.948
Do you have any
witch cruets?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.834
Excuse me?

10:02.919 --> 10:06.705
I have a few, but I'm always
looking for more.

10:06.789 --> 10:08.990
I use them
for salad dressing,

10:09.041 --> 10:11.710
but apparently, they're
meant for killing witches.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.546
Is that right?

10:17.300 --> 10:20.001
All you need is
mandrake root

10:20.052 --> 10:21.887
and some blood.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.055
Ahh!

10:34.400 --> 10:35.734
And a personal item

10:35.818 --> 10:38.703
that's absorbed some
of the witch's energy.

10:38.788 --> 10:41.206
Please.
It's my wedding ring.

10:42.825 --> 10:45.693
Then as long as
the cruet's been spelled,

10:45.745 --> 10:48.079
all you have to do next
is throw in a match,

10:48.164 --> 10:51.366
and ding dong,
the witch is dead.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.386
But you knew that,
didn't you?

10:58.707 --> 11:02.143
You're not a very
powerful witch, are you, Calvin?

11:07.433 --> 11:10.569
If Cassie Blake comes in here
and asks any questions,

11:10.653 --> 11:14.722
all you're going
to say is, "I don't know."

11:14.774 --> 11:16.157
Got it?

11:18.394 --> 11:20.579
Yes. I swear it.

11:20.663 --> 11:24.199
Great.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.252
Probably best you don't
carry these in your shop.

11:27.336 --> 11:30.422
Dangerous things.

11:39.412 --> 11:41.496
Mr. Wilson?

11:47.486 --> 11:48.587
Oh.

11:48.654 --> 11:49.921
You were here
this morning.

11:49.989 --> 11:52.174
I have something
to show you.

11:52.258 --> 11:53.623
I'm a little busy here.

11:53.624 --> 11:55.742
Ok. Well, can you
just tell me what it is?

11:58.713 --> 12:01.548
I don't know.

12:01.599 --> 12:03.350
I wish I could be
more helpful.

12:03.401 --> 12:04.935
Hmm. Ok.

12:05.019 --> 12:07.720
Well, if you--if you
think of anything, then, um...

12:09.991 --> 12:14.127
I will write down my
name and my number,

12:14.195 --> 12:15.829
and you can call me.

12:15.896 --> 12:19.032
All right.

12:25.923 --> 12:27.958
Oh, my God.
I--that was so dumb.

12:28.042 --> 12:29.576
I'm sorry.
Can I help you clean it up?

12:29.644 --> 12:30.961
Do you have, like,
a broom or something?

12:31.045 --> 12:31.928
Of course,
I will pay for it.

12:32.013 --> 12:36.099
Never mind.
I'll do it.

13:01.292 --> 13:02.775
Jake.

13:10.301 --> 13:11.751
You miss him, too?

13:11.802 --> 13:13.953
Not exactly.

13:15.289 --> 13:17.123
I'm here for them.

13:18.759 --> 13:21.094
Look, you don't have
to be all tough.

13:21.145 --> 13:22.512
We both loved him.

13:22.597 --> 13:25.632
I hadn't seen Nick
in two years.

13:25.683 --> 13:28.134
When I was living here, all
we did was fight.

13:28.186 --> 13:31.321
So take this trip down
memory lane by yourself.

13:31.389 --> 13:33.823
Wow.

13:33.908 --> 13:35.408
Great Big Brother.

13:35.476 --> 13:37.661
He was playing with things that
he shouldn't have.

13:37.745 --> 13:40.163
He wound up dead.

13:40.248 --> 13:41.981
I could've told him.

13:42.033 --> 13:43.483
But you weren't here
to do that.

13:43.534 --> 13:45.085
You just left.

13:45.152 --> 13:47.537
So maybe this is on you.

13:50.341 --> 13:51.625
You know,
I actually thought

13:51.676 --> 13:53.326
we might be able
to be friends,

13:53.377 --> 13:54.928
that we had
something in common.

13:54.995 --> 13:58.048
I'm nothing like
the rest of you.

13:59.550 --> 14:00.884
Trust me.

14:09.310 --> 14:11.278
Ok. See how close
you can get to this one,

14:11.345 --> 14:12.612
the third symbol.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.231
It could be
an old crest.

14:14.315 --> 14:16.182
People used to etch them
into objects of all kinds.

14:16.234 --> 14:17.517
It's like
a family seal.

14:19.070 --> 14:20.853
All right. I recreated the images
on the sketch pad app

14:20.905 --> 14:21.988
and ran a search.

14:22.039 --> 14:25.024
Might take a few minutes
to scan for matches.

14:27.378 --> 14:28.995
I--I called Diana,
she should be here, too.

14:29.046 --> 14:31.164
If she knows I'm here,
she won't come.

14:31.215 --> 14:33.133
I don't blame her.

14:38.005 --> 14:39.339
Ever since I was little,

14:39.390 --> 14:41.308
my dad would talk about

14:41.375 --> 14:43.343
how he was supposed
to be with Amelia,

14:43.394 --> 14:46.379
and how I'm fated to be
with Amelia's daughter.

14:46.430 --> 14:49.849
I should have known he'd
say it to Diana, too.

14:49.900 --> 14:53.687
But this breakup isn't
his fault--it's mine.

14:53.738 --> 14:56.940
The only reason Diana
believed what he said is

14:57.024 --> 14:59.359
because it's the way
I've been acting.

14:59.410 --> 15:02.862
I'm sorry for anything I did
to make that worse.

15:02.913 --> 15:07.417
I don't know what's between you
and me, exactly.

15:07.501 --> 15:11.755
But I know that without Diana,
I'm not much of anything.

15:11.822 --> 15:15.175
Then you should fight
for her.

15:16.177 --> 15:18.044
Show her that.

15:18.112 --> 15:20.747
Forbidden love.
So adorable.

15:20.798 --> 15:22.065
Am I interrupting?

15:22.133 --> 15:23.516
Uh, no, no.

15:23.584 --> 15:25.352
Did you find anything
in my book about

15:25.419 --> 15:27.354
the symbols on the blade?
No.

15:27.421 --> 15:31.358
But I did find a cool attraction
spell for future reference.

15:31.425 --> 15:33.643
I got a match.

15:33.728 --> 15:35.528
That's it.

15:35.596 --> 15:37.197
Does it belong to
any family name?

15:37.264 --> 15:40.533
Not a family. A society.

15:40.601 --> 15:44.988
The Geticas,
also known as "The Hunters."

15:45.072 --> 15:47.057
This goes back all the way
to the Middle Ages.

15:47.124 --> 15:48.491
Hunters?

15:50.077 --> 15:52.445
Its motto is
from ancient text--

15:52.496 --> 15:56.499
"Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live."

15:56.584 --> 16:00.837
So the girl who attacked me
wasn't a crazy witch.

16:00.921 --> 16:03.390
She was a witch hunter.

16:03.457 --> 16:06.476
Adam Conant...

16:06.560 --> 16:09.128
Diana Meade...

16:11.816 --> 16:15.235
Faye Chamberlain...

16:15.302 --> 16:17.153
Melissa Glaser...

16:17.238 --> 16:20.640
and Cassie Blake.

16:22.142 --> 16:24.761
As angry as you were
at Simone for hurrying

16:24.786 --> 16:25.986
along the process,

16:26.480 --> 16:28.198
at least
she did the marking.

16:28.282 --> 16:29.616
Now you don't have to.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.267
Simone ignored the plan.

16:31.335 --> 16:33.770
She could have ruined
everything.

16:33.838 --> 16:36.356
If you kill a bound
witch the wrong way,

16:36.424 --> 16:38.458
their powers can pass
to other witches,

16:38.509 --> 16:40.377
make them stronger.

16:40.444 --> 16:42.629
We can't afford
mistakes.

16:42.696 --> 16:44.653
Which is why some of us
are worried about a plan

16:44.678 --> 16:45.878
that hinges on you.

16:46.016 --> 16:48.184
Witchcraft took my parents
and my brother.

16:48.269 --> 16:49.803
I know
which side I'm on.

16:49.854 --> 16:51.471
Now, do you want me
to do this or not?

16:51.522 --> 16:54.057
Because if I don't spell these,
they're just fancy bottles,

16:54.141 --> 16:56.693
and you're back to
burning witches at the stake.

17:00.865 --> 17:02.148
Go ahead.

17:02.199 --> 17:03.867
Spell the vessels.

17:12.877 --> 17:15.044
Let light rise
out of darkness.

17:17.464 --> 17:20.366
Let light rise
out of darkness.

17:21.669 --> 17:23.803
Let light rise
out of darkness.

17:25.388 --> 17:28.208
Let light rise
out of darkness.

17:28.275 --> 17:31.060
Let light rise
out of darkness.

17:39.687 --> 17:41.187
It's done.

17:44.024 --> 17:47.076
Add their blood,
the objects,

17:47.161 --> 17:49.612
set it on fire,

17:49.697 --> 17:51.564
they die.

17:51.615 --> 17:54.367
And their magic dies
with them.

17:54.418 --> 17:55.618
Good.

17:55.703 --> 18:00.206
We can't risk outing you
in the process.

18:00.257 --> 18:02.842
So, we'll have some brothers
at the party,

18:02.910 --> 18:04.577
doing the gathering
for you.

18:04.628 --> 18:06.596
Ian came with us
from Salem.

18:08.432 --> 18:10.934
And one of our hunters
is from here in town.

18:14.522 --> 18:17.590
He's very familiar
with the targets.

18:32.385 --> 18:35.254
That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.

18:35.284 --> 18:36.488
What are you
talking about?

18:36.489 --> 18:38.006
We found out
what those symbols mean.

18:38.074 --> 18:40.592
- And?
- She was a witch hunter.

18:40.659 --> 18:43.428
Wait.
If she was a witch hunter,

18:43.496 --> 18:45.263
why would she bother
lying to me?

18:45.331 --> 18:46.715
I don't know.

18:46.799 --> 18:49.434
Are you sure she didn't say
anything else to you?

18:49.502 --> 18:51.436
No, just exactly
what I told you.

18:51.504 --> 18:53.138
- Hmm.
- How do you know

18:53.189 --> 18:54.873
she wasn't just
some crazy witch?

18:54.941 --> 18:56.358
What else have you
really got to go on?

18:56.442 --> 18:59.444
Just those 3 symbols?

19:01.397 --> 19:04.182
Um, I'll see you
at the party tonight?

19:04.233 --> 19:06.535
I might drop by.

19:06.619 --> 19:08.453
Yeah.

19:17.663 --> 19:20.698
You know, it's times like this
I pity the normals.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.534
They will never be
this cool.

19:23.469 --> 19:26.888
What else can we do?
Bats.

19:26.973 --> 19:28.473
Take flight and dive.

19:28.541 --> 19:31.042
Take flight and dive.

19:32.512 --> 19:35.263
Ohh!

19:39.885 --> 19:41.853
Aah!

19:43.072 --> 19:46.858
Wow, nice work.

19:46.909 --> 19:50.529
Um, hey, look,
when Jake shows up,

19:50.580 --> 19:52.280
do you think you can
keep him occupied?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.249
Why do you think
I'm wearing this?

19:54.317 --> 19:55.917
Oh. Right.

19:56.002 --> 19:58.336
Wait, why do you
want him occupied?

19:58.404 --> 19:59.838
When I showed him the fleam,
he knew that there were

19:59.905 --> 20:01.122
3 symbols when mine
was missing one.

20:01.207 --> 20:04.125
He obviously knows more
than he's telling us.

Thank you.

20:47.836 --> 20:49.620
Have fun tonight.

20:49.671 --> 20:52.840
Diana, wait.

20:52.925 --> 20:55.810
Is this who we are now?
We don't even talk?

20:55.894 --> 20:59.180
What's left that
you want me to say?

20:59.264 --> 21:00.982
Tell me
how to fix this.

21:01.066 --> 21:03.184
Adam, don't.

21:03.268 --> 21:04.268
I love you.

21:04.319 --> 21:07.772
So if I let you
forget that...

21:07.823 --> 21:09.440
Then let me try again.

21:09.491 --> 21:11.442
I know
we can work it out.

21:11.493 --> 21:14.745
We shouldn't have
to work so hard.

21:14.813 --> 21:16.414
Not everything is perfect,
Diana.

21:16.481 --> 21:18.783
Sometimes--sometimes,
things get a little out of control.

21:18.834 --> 21:20.418
But that doesn't mean
it's wrong.

21:20.485 --> 21:21.919
Like Cassie?

21:34.550 --> 21:37.101
Whiskey, neat, right?

21:37.169 --> 21:40.438
Good memory.
I'm impressed.

21:40.505 --> 21:42.173
Don't be.

21:42.224 --> 21:45.693
What brings you
across town?

21:45.777 --> 21:49.447
Can't an old friend
just stop by for a visit?

21:49.514 --> 21:51.566
Not after 16 years, no.

21:55.487 --> 21:58.156
Maybe I wasn't in
your circle,

21:58.207 --> 22:01.242
but I never gave you
a reason not to trust me.

22:05.464 --> 22:08.716
You shouldn't
have come here.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.535
Well, it wasn't on
the top of my list, either,

22:11.587 --> 22:15.223
but Amelia Blake's daughter came
to my store this morning.

22:15.307 --> 22:17.975
Really.
Why's that?

22:18.043 --> 22:19.877
Thought you might know.

22:19.928 --> 22:22.215
She was asking questions
about some old hunting

22:22.240 --> 22:23.556
acquaintances of ours.

22:26.885 --> 22:28.011
It's funny.

22:28.036 --> 22:30.525
I couldn't see much of
her mother in her, at first,

22:31.206 --> 22:33.391
not until she told me
who she was.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.643
You know how it is
with kids.

22:35.711 --> 22:38.396
It's hard to predict
which parent they'll favor.

22:40.732 --> 22:42.366
She's Amelia's daughter,
Cal.

22:42.417 --> 22:43.768
Are you sure?

22:43.835 --> 22:47.004
'Cause you were always a bit blind
when it came to Amelia.

22:47.072 --> 22:51.659
We were all blind except Amelia,
in the end.

23:00.285 --> 23:03.271
She doesn't even know who her
father really was, does she?

23:03.355 --> 23:04.889
What he was attempting
to do that night?

23:04.940 --> 23:06.418
And there's no reason
she should.

23:06.443 --> 23:07.643
Why not?

23:07.759 --> 23:11.729
Especially if she's as much like
Amelia as you say.

23:11.780 --> 23:13.397
Just leave it alone.

23:13.448 --> 23:16.234
She needs to know
about John Blackwell.

23:16.301 --> 23:19.270
She has a right

Killer bee, actually.

26:34.983 --> 26:37.601
Come on, Faye.

26:39.688 --> 26:42.440
Don't try and deny
something's going on.

26:42.491 --> 26:45.109
Is this going
to be drama?

26:45.160 --> 26:48.496
No. No drama.

26:49.948 --> 26:52.450
But something's
different with you.

26:52.501 --> 26:54.752
You were always an ass,

26:54.819 --> 26:57.821
and you always had
a cruel streak.

27:00.158 --> 27:02.159
But you were never
distant.

27:04.829 --> 27:07.097
Not when
we were like this.

27:07.165 --> 27:10.034
Maybe you just always thought
there was more there,

27:10.101 --> 27:11.685
and there wasn't.

27:14.105 --> 27:18.809
No. I've felt it
since you got back.

28:07.216 --> 28:09.034
Looking for something?

28:09.101 --> 28:13.421
Uh, just Nick's MP3 player,
for Melissa.

28:13.506 --> 28:15.757
You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.

28:15.841 --> 28:17.609
Did you think
stabbing it to death

28:17.677 --> 28:19.260
would get her
the closure she needs?

28:19.328 --> 28:22.547
No. But what else
would you use it for?

28:22.598 --> 28:26.685
Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?

28:28.053 --> 28:29.771
Why do you have it?

28:29.855 --> 28:31.823
It's not mine.

28:31.891 --> 28:33.992
You're telling me
this is Nick's?

28:34.059 --> 28:38.330
I'm going to
show you something.

28:38.397 --> 28:40.198
But you can't tell
anyone.

28:59.935 --> 29:00.018
I know.

29:01.437 --> 29:03.054
Nick was always
into weird stuff,

29:03.105 --> 29:06.224
but I never
expected this.

29:08.060 --> 29:11.396
These symbols mean
witch hunter.

29:11.447 --> 29:13.448
Same as the girl had
on her blade.

29:13.532 --> 29:16.067
Why didn't you
show me these?

29:16.118 --> 29:17.702
To protect him.

29:17.770 --> 29:19.888
I know
how this looks.

29:19.955 --> 29:21.656
He was no traitor.

29:21.724 --> 29:23.908
No, of course not. There's no
way Nick was a witch hunter.

29:23.959 --> 29:26.795
But she was, so--

29:26.862 --> 29:28.380
so, what's
the connection?

29:28.447 --> 29:30.081
I don't know yet.

29:30.132 --> 29:33.234
Maybe Nick was looking
into that witch hunter stuff

29:33.302 --> 29:35.336
and got on their radar.

29:35.421 --> 29:39.891
You think Nick's the reason
she came here?

29:39.958 --> 29:42.126
Let me see the knife.

29:43.596 --> 29:45.697
Well,
isn't this creepy.

29:45.765 --> 29:47.348
Is this what it takes
to get you excited,

29:47.433 --> 29:48.923
a little girl
with a knife?

29:48.924 --> 29:52.309
Cassie, I can't find Melissa,
we should get back.

30:10.456 --> 30:11.923
I thought you were going
to distract him.

30:11.990 --> 30:13.324
I tried.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.093
I didn't realize you were waiting
for him in his room.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.544
No, I was looking
for something.

30:16.629 --> 30:19.047
But then, I found
something else.

30:20.633 --> 30:21.833
Oh!

30:23.803 --> 30:25.053
Hello?

30:25.137 --> 30:28.556
Cassie, my name is
Calvin Wilson.

30:28.641 --> 30:31.726
We met at my shop
earlier today.

30:31.811 --> 30:33.278
Of course.

30:33.345 --> 30:36.030
I left something
for you.

30:36.115 --> 30:37.615
You're in danger.

30:37.683 --> 30:41.352
In danger?
What do you mean?

30:41.403 --> 30:42.687
Mr. Wilson?

30:42.738 --> 30:45.022
Mr. Wilson.

30:45.074 --> 30:48.259
No costume
on Halloween?

30:48.327 --> 30:52.196
Hello?
Mr. Wilson?

30:54.583 --> 30:56.885
Sorry.
No problem.

30:56.969 --> 31:00.555
I think I got something
on your face. May I?

31:10.099 --> 31:11.933
Was my warning
not specific enough?

31:12.017 --> 31:14.519
I wasn't going to tell
her anything about you.

31:14.570 --> 31:15.904
Remember this?

31:15.988 --> 31:18.323
I had a feeling
you'd try to be a hero.

31:18.390 --> 31:21.075
Please. This is just
something personal.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.610
It doesn't concern you.

31:22.695 --> 31:24.061
Try me.

31:28.534 --> 31:29.734
All right.

31:29.785 --> 31:33.621
She has dark magic
inside her.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.292
So why are you so desperate
to tell her?

31:37.376 --> 31:38.793
So she can fight it.

31:38.878 --> 31:41.129
Maybe stop it from
overcoming her.

31:41.213 --> 31:43.515
You think people can change
who they are?

31:43.582 --> 31:45.350
Of course.

31:45.417 --> 31:46.801
I don't.

32:07.823 --> 32:10.074
Out. Now.

32:19.618 --> 32:22.086
Oh, hey, Adam.

32:22.087 --> 32:23.127
Have you found
Melissa and Diana?

32:23.128 --> 32:24.958
Because the guy I met at the
antiquities shop called,

32:24.959 --> 32:27.557
freaked out, and I think he was
trying to warn me

32:28.126 --> 32:31.179
about w--

32:59.415 --> 33:01.683
Luke?

33:01.750 --> 33:03.935
You bleed just like us.

33:04.020 --> 33:05.920
But you're not.

33:05.971 --> 33:08.223
That's enough.
Finish the cruet.

33:12.645 --> 33:15.313
- What's going on?
- Witch hunters.

33:16.482 --> 33:19.100
This is a ring
of iron sulphide

33:19.168 --> 33:20.618
to stop your powers.

33:20.686 --> 33:24.689
Science prevailing over
your ungodly magic.

33:24.757 --> 33:26.541
We haven't done
anything wrong.

33:26.608 --> 33:27.826
But you will.

33:28.944 --> 33:32.364
Luke, please.
Stop this.

33:32.431 --> 33:33.665
Tell him that
we're not a threat.

33:33.749 --> 33:35.417
You bound
your circle, Cassie.

33:35.468 --> 33:37.469
No one to blame
but yourselves.

33:37.553 --> 33:39.954
So you've been
spying on us all this time,

33:40.005 --> 33:43.058
just to narc to
other witch hunters?

33:43.125 --> 33:45.593
Like my father did.
And his father.

33:45.644 --> 33:48.730
You aren't the only ones
born into a legacy.

33:48.797 --> 33:49.848
At least I can be
proud of mine.

33:49.932 --> 33:51.516
Enough.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.801
Finish it.

33:58.407 --> 34:02.577
"Watch the witch,
but never trust him,

34:02.644 --> 34:06.114
"for his every thought
is a sin,

34:06.165 --> 34:08.949
his every word a lie."

34:12.821 --> 34:13.955
You have to stop this.

34:14.005 --> 34:15.290
You shouldn't be here.

34:15.341 --> 34:16.925
Cassie has dark magic.

34:16.992 --> 34:18.259
All magic is dark.

34:18.327 --> 34:19.260
Not like this.

34:19.328 --> 34:21.295
Cassie isn't like
other witches, Isaac.

34:21.347 --> 34:22.464
She's stronger.

34:22.514 --> 34:24.431
We can't kill her
this way.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.717
You have to trust me.

34:26.802 --> 34:29.137
You've become
a great asset to me.

34:29.188 --> 34:31.473
But you are
too close to this.

34:31.524 --> 34:33.224
I won't stop it.

34:36.846 --> 34:40.447
Luke, don't.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.449
Look, Luke,
I'm your friend.

34:42.518 --> 34:44.953
That's why I wanted to
be the one to do this.

34:45.020 --> 34:46.905
I'm freeing you
from a life of sin.

34:46.989 --> 34:48.540
That's not true.

34:50.543 --> 34:52.210
I'm sorry, Diana.

34:53.329 --> 34:55.964
You have a good heart,

34:56.031 --> 34:58.006
but it's not enough
to protect you from

34:58.031 --> 34:59.609
your true nature.

35:01.703 --> 35:04.205
This will be fast.
I promise.

35:10.229 --> 35:12.147
No!

35:47.348 --> 35:48.548
Oh my God.

35:48.601 --> 35:52.437
Trust me now?

36:17.746 --> 36:19.113
Are you ok?

36:19.164 --> 36:22.251
A guy--a guy in
a pig mask jumped me

36:22.276 --> 36:23.584
and brought me here.

36:24.003 --> 36:25.286
I fought him off.

36:25.337 --> 36:26.454
Where did he go?

36:26.505 --> 36:28.623
There was an explosion
from inside,

36:28.674 --> 36:32.510
and he ran off. Another guy
came running out, too.

36:34.513 --> 36:36.147
What happened
in there?

36:49.456 --> 36:52.658
It's me. It's ok.

36:53.145 --> 36:54.863
What are you doing here?

36:54.930 --> 36:57.532
I had to see you.
I was worried.

36:57.599 --> 37:00.568
It's ok. I'm ok.

37:00.620 --> 37:03.822
When he had
your blood...

37:03.906 --> 37:07.425
I know.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.777
It's all so real now.

37:09.829 --> 37:12.864
My whole life,
everyone said,

37:12.932 --> 37:16.217
"there's that kid who lost
his mom. How sad."

37:16.285 --> 37:18.786
But you can't lose something
you never had.

37:18.838 --> 37:23.008
Every day, my dad pulls away
a little more.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.781
You are my home,
Diana.

37:31.233 --> 37:33.151
Maybe I'm just supposed
to just let you go now,

37:33.235 --> 37:34.986
but I can't.

37:35.071 --> 37:39.824
Because I can't lose
everything I have all at once.

37:41.694 --> 37:44.863
I want to get past this.

37:44.947 --> 37:49.551
I know not everything
can be perfect.

37:49.618 --> 37:51.753
But I have to believe
that it can be,

37:51.820 --> 37:55.006
just so fighting for it
makes sense.

37:55.074 --> 37:57.042
And you're not
a believer?

37:57.126 --> 38:00.045
Not right now.

38:24.853 --> 38:26.404
You look
a little rattled.

38:26.489 --> 38:29.290
Oh.

38:29.358 --> 38:31.794
I just--how can there be
people out there that

38:31.819 --> 38:33.238
hate us so much, you know?

38:33.862 --> 38:36.331
It's like,
we haven't done anything.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.918
We didn't choose this.
We were--we were born this way.

38:40.002 --> 38:42.470
People don't understand.

38:42.538 --> 38:44.872
What they don't
understand scares them.

38:46.875 --> 38:50.228
You seem so calm
about it all.

38:50.312 --> 38:53.932
I've been at this
longer than you.

38:55.384 --> 38:58.403
Have you ever done magic
on your own?

39:02.491 --> 39:05.076
I...

39:05.161 --> 39:07.829
I think I did something
on my own tonight.

39:07.896 --> 39:09.730
Really?

39:09.782 --> 39:13.251
I think I stopped one of those
witch hunters from killing Diana.

39:13.335 --> 39:16.504
That's
a pretty good trick.

39:20.593 --> 39:25.764
So, why didn't they round you
up with the rest of us?

39:25.848 --> 39:28.767
Don't trust me, huh?

39:28.834 --> 39:32.754
Not really.

39:32.822 --> 39:35.807
That's ok.

39:35.891 --> 39:37.725
I don't mind having
to earn it.

39:37.777 --> 39:40.445
Mmm.

39:42.615 --> 39:44.783
Good luck with that.

40:41.757 --> 40:44.375
Henry?

40:49.181 --> 40:51.766
Henry, it's Jane.
You here?

41:19.578 --> 41:21.329
Sorem est.
Sorem est.

41:21.380 --> 41:23.164
Sorem est.
