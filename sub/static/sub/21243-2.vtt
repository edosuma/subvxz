[Shay] What are you talking about?

00:14.514 --> 00:18.435
Everyone's face is either a bird,
a horse or a muffin, and I'm a muffin.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.563
-Hmm? What's happening?
-I think Lola's having a stroke.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.067
Frankie, do you have a second?

00:26.151 --> 00:29.696
Oh, is this about my essay?
I know my thesis wasn't the strongest.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.989
I just wanna check
and make sure that you're doing okay.

00:32.074 --> 00:35.202
-Was it really that bad?
-No, it's about your socials.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.494
After everything that's happened,

00:36.578 --> 00:38.705
the administration is trying to
keep an eye on kids

00:38.788 --> 00:40.207

00:40.290 --> 00:42.584
Wait, [scoffs]
you think I'm struggling?

00:42.667 --> 00:45.712
You've been posting
a lot of sad pics, stories, tweets...

00:45.795 --> 00:47.589
You guys follow all that stuff?

00:47.672 --> 00:49.424
I know breakups are hard,

00:49.507 --> 00:51.759
and now that
Jonah's dating Grace, it just--

00:51.843 --> 00:55.513
Ugh, no. Okay.
No, I'm... I'm totally fine. I'm fine.

00:55.597 --> 00:59.392
Well, if you ever need to talk,
you know where to find me.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.643
[Frankie] Mmm-hmm.

01:01.894 --> 01:04.356
-[Shay] What was that about?
-She was worried about me.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.816
Apparently, I'm high risk
'cause of the stuff I put online.

01:06.899 --> 01:09.111
Did you know the administration
looks at our socials?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.695
Okay, but maybe she has a point?

01:10.778 --> 01:13.448
I mean, your feed's been
kind of depressing lately.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.036
-[chuckles]
-I'm going through a breakup.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.456
But it's not, like, scary sad.
It's just regular sad.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.708
And that's why you're losing the breakup.

01:23.791 --> 01:25.168
What does that even mean?

01:25.252 --> 01:29.005
Okay, Jonah's got a new girlfriend,
and Frankie's been moping around online.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.049
You have to show him what he's missing.
How happy and awesome you are.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.593
But I'm neither of those things.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.429
Okay, could you tell that
I was going through a breakup with Tiny?

01:36.513 --> 01:39.266
-No, you look great in all of these.

like creatine, beta-alanine,

04:20.217 --> 04:21.303
to help them build muscle,

04:21.386 --> 04:23.721

If I don't improve, I won't get into
a Division I school next year,

04:45.660 --> 04:48.871

as a competitive athlete is over.

-Yeah.

I'm just trying to get home.
I don't want any trouble.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.314
Ah, well, you should've thought about that
before you gave me this black eye.

09:25.397 --> 09:27.942
You need to stay away from us
and our friends.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.738
I don't have to listen
to anything you say.

-What're you doing here?
-Don't "what're you doing here" me.

10:42.349 --> 10:44.143
I knew you were sneaking around
behind my back

10:44.226 --> 10:47.479
-and I asked you about it and you lied.
-I never lied.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.649
Everything we've been through,
and that's all you have to say?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.818
Nothing that I ever did
was good enough for you, okay?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.153
Clearly, breaking up
didn't even change that.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.448
-Maybe I should go get snacks.
-No, forget it. I'll go.

Karima is going to love these.

12:01.428 --> 12:03.389
I want her to see how happy we are here.

12:04.766 --> 12:09.228
-Are you happy?
-Why wouldn't I be? It's awesome here.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.731
-[sighs] Disagree.
-Maybe you'll have more fun

12:12.815 --> 12:14.525
if you stop being so grumpy all the time.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.235
I'm not the problem.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.611
[Lola gasps]

12:17.694 --> 12:19.446
[chuckling] Oh, who did you think I was?

12:20.322 --> 12:21.991
No one. I just...

12:22.074 --> 12:23.826
-I'm sorry.
-[chuckles] It's okay.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.245
Um, I just wanted to let you know
that you got the job.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.455
[chuckles] I did?

12:28.539 --> 12:30.207
Uh, yeah. You totally kicked butt.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.960
[sighs] Thank you so much...

12:34.003 --> 12:35.712
but I can't accept.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.424
-What?
-[sighs]

12:38.507 --> 12:39.801
Why not?

12:39.884 --> 12:44.430
I've made some enemies here
and I don't want to cause trouble for you.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.639
Enemies?

12:46.808 --> 12:49.852
Oh, you mean Zig and Tiny.
I'm not scared of those idiots.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.604
I don't think they would be very happy
if I took the job.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.858
I'm not going to let some bully stop me
from hiring the right person.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.776
You said you really need the work.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.946
-I do.
-Then don't let those dumb-dumbs stop you.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.198
Plus, if you say no,
I'm gonna have to hire Shay,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.826
-and she's gonna put us out of business.
-[chuckles]

13:06.202 --> 13:07.870
I'll take that as a yes?

13:07.954 --> 13:11.207
[chuckles] How can I ever thank you?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.876
By being the best busboy
Lola's Cantina has ever seen.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.545
-And maybe a box of jelly beans?
-[both chuckle]

13:19.590 --> 13:23.302
See? Maybe it's not so bad here after all.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.472
[whistle blows]

13:26.555 --> 13:28.724
Thank you, ladies.
We'll see you tomorrow.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.228
[Shay panting]

13:33.437 --> 13:34.730
[Tiny] No faster, huh?

13:34.813 --> 13:38.817
[panting] My whole future is resting
on tenths of a second.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.237
I need to figure out a way
to pay for those supplements.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.489
What about the cash
you got from the training shift?

13:43.572 --> 13:47.243
Not nearly enough.
I need to be able to keep affording them.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.372
-[sighs]
-What?

13:51.455 --> 13:54.833
Lola gave Saad the job.
I heard them talking this morning.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.252
Seriously?

13:56.335 --> 13:59.213
Shay, I've been waiting in the car
for 15 minutes.

13:59.296 --> 14:03.050
-Sorry, Mom.
-Hi, Mrs. Powers. How was work?

14:03.134 --> 14:05.094
Long. This kid swallowed a battery.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.679
It came out, thank God,
without too much damage to his insides.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.473
-[both chuckle]
-Sweet.

14:09.556 --> 14:11.017
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.728
You know how I was saying
I need to become the fastest in the school

14:14.811 --> 14:17.982
-to get a chance at a good scholarship?
-Uh-huh.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.817
Well, there are these supplements
Mr. Armstrong told me about.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.736
I'm sorry,
we can't afford anything like that.

14:22.819 --> 14:25.697
-They cost 200 or 300 a month.
-But I need to get faster.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.491
It's my only shot.
I'm almost there.

14:27.574 --> 14:28.951
Well, then you're just gonna
have to train.

14:29.035 --> 14:33.039
I do train. More than anyone else.
It's not enough.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.748
What was the point of me working so hard

14:34.831 --> 14:36.458
if stupid puberty
was going to mess everything up?

14:36.542 --> 14:37.543
-Shay--
-No.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.336
You promised that if I work harder
than everyone else,

14:39.420 --> 14:43.132
I can achieve anything that I want.
Well, you lied. Everyone lied!

14:43.215 --> 14:46.177
Honey,
I wish I could help you out. [sighs]

14:47.094 --> 14:50.681
But don't worry, because if I know you,
you'll find another way.

14:56.353 --> 15:00.149
-So is Esme your new BFF?
-What?

15:00.774 --> 15:01.858
Wait, how do you know that?

15:01.943 --> 15:04.820
Because your escapades are posted
all over the Internet, dumbass.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.328
[Jonah on video]
Hey, what is your problem?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.080
It used to be you!

15:14.163 --> 15:16.290
I cannot believe you abandoned me
for those losers.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.960
-Oh, God. Do you think Mom's seen these?
-I sure have.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.336
Okay, I can explain.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.589
-Why you destroyed Jonah's guitar?
-It was his fault.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.341
He showed up with Grace
and he was looking all happy,

15:25.424 --> 15:28.052
when the whole point of me going
was to show him how happy I am.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.096
-That must have been hard.
-It was!

15:30.179 --> 15:32.264
[sighs] Oh, God, I just feel like,

15:32.348 --> 15:34.183
no matter what I do,
I'm doomed to be miserable.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.727
[chuckles] That's not true.
But you are doomed to be grounded.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.856
That's unfair. You never grounded Miles
for any of the crazy stuff he did.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.859
That's 'cause I'm not dumb enough
to put photos of me all over the Internet.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.945
Fine. Whatever.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.655
After this, no one will want to
hang out with me anyway.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.158
-I'm such a loser.
-I can't argue with that.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.123
And as for the guitar, you're gonna
give Jonah the money to pay for it.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.791
-No, Mom, no.
-Yes, Frankie, yes.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.669
-Do it today.
-[grunts]

16:03.420 --> 16:05.547
Hey, that's what you get
for hanging out with crazy Esme.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.925
-She was the one who posted that stuff?
-Who else?

16:09.635 --> 16:12.554
[scoffs] And here I was thinking
she was actually being a friend.

16:13.930 --> 16:16.225
-[sighs]
-You didn't even tell me yourself.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.185
-I was scared you'd be mad.
-I am mad!

16:18.269 --> 16:19.561
You know I need that money.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.189
Okay, I can't just give you a job
you're bad at.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.316
But you can give it to some guy
you don't even know?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.902
-He punched Zig, Lola.
-Because Zig went after him first.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.404
-So, that makes it okay?
-No, but...

16:29.780 --> 16:32.699
Okay, how about some free nachos instead?

16:32.783 --> 16:35.494
And then maybe I can help you
find a job you are qualified for.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.620
-[dishes clattering]
-One sec.

16:36.703 --> 16:38.330
[speaking Spanish]

16:53.220 --> 16:54.805
[indistinct chatter]

17:11.988 --> 17:13.699
-[Grace] Hey. [chuckles]
-[Jonah] Hey.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.827
Nope. No.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.911
[Rasha] I don't understand.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.538
Why is she destroying
that musical instrument?

17:19.621 --> 17:21.415
-[Goldi] Because she's crazy.
-[both giggling]

17:21.498 --> 17:22.833
[Jonah on video]
Hey, what is your problem?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.293
[Frankie on video] It used to be you!

17:31.550 --> 17:33.802
-So, what are we doing tonight?
-Oh, I'm not here to make plans.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.346
-I'm here to yell at you.
-Why?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.431
For posting all that stuff.
I got in so much trouble.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.516
[chuckles] Someone's being
a little dramatic.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.435
I'm grounded.
And everyone's laughing at me.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.936
Not everyone.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.524
Five hundred likes? Tons of comments?
People think you're totally badass.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.735
Are you sure it says "badass"
and not "pathetic"?

17:49.818 --> 17:51.737
"I wish I did that to my ex's car."

17:51.820 --> 17:54.365
Taylor Swift made an entire career
off of her exes.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.449
You really think she cares

17:55.532 --> 17:57.493
what people she went to high school with
are saying about her?

17:57.576 --> 18:00.496
Yes? I have to give Jonah
money for his guitar,

18:00.579 --> 18:03.039
but the thought of speaking to him
makes me wanna barf.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.791
Then keep the cash.
We'll go get massages.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.042
[chuckles sarcastically]
That's a great idea.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.545
Except if my mom found out,
she would kill me.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.256
Then we just need to find a way
to get him the money

18:10.339 --> 18:12.174
that makes you feel awesome.

18:17.221 --> 18:21.392
Here. Let me help you with that.
Enjoy your meal.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.685
Saad, can I talk to you?

18:24.270 --> 18:27.439
Should I have offered to clean
his sunglasses before giving them back?

18:27.523 --> 18:28.815
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.235
I'm sorry.
I just want to do the best job for you.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.279
Too late. You're fired.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.365
-What?
-The tips are missing.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.201
And you think I took them?

18:39.285 --> 18:40.786
Well, we haven't had a problem
before you started.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.454
-I would never steal from you.
-Wouldn't you say that

18:42.538 --> 18:44.080
if you had taken it?

18:44.998 --> 18:48.084
-There must be another explanation.
-Not one I can find.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.881
I thought you were different.

18:52.964 --> 18:56.677
But you're judgmental and small-minded
like everyone else here.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.092
-[Esme] There he is.
-[sighs] Is this a totally stupid idea?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.053
No, I promise you, it's not.
People are gonna love it. Ready?

19:40.136 --> 19:41.263
[chuckles]

19:45.684 --> 19:46.685
Jonah.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.189
Frankie?

19:51.147 --> 19:53.192
I have something for you.

19:57.153 --> 20:00.073
-What the hell?
-Oh, it's for a new guitar.

20:00.156 --> 20:04.828
So you can pay for a date.
For once... in... your... life.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.291
That was totally badass.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.252
-Okay. Posted.
-[both chuckle]

20:12.378 --> 20:14.421
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[both giggling]

20:14.505 --> 20:15.839
Oh, my God.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.648
-Seriously?
-[Shay] Um...

20:32.731 --> 20:36.067
-I was just--
-Putting back the money you stole?

20:36.151 --> 20:37.444
Yeah.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.988
I fired Saad because I thought he took it.

20:40.071 --> 20:41.615
Everyone's gonna think
I'm a racist employer now.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.618
-I'm so, so sorry.
-Why would you do that?

20:44.701 --> 20:48.372
I mean, it just...
I have to pay for these supplements.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.249
It's the only way
I'm gonna get fast enough to get scouted.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.502
Because if I don't
get scouted this year... that's it.

20:53.585 --> 20:57.088
The thing I've wanted my entire life
just... just goes away.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.594
-[sighs] You're lucky I love you so much.
-Wait, you're not gonna tell?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.388
Did you put all the money back?

21:04.471 --> 21:07.516
Yeah, plus an extra 20
from my birthday money.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.351
Okay, well,
I don't want to get you into trouble.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.272
And I know how much
this running thing means to you.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.858
It doesn't even matter.
I'm toast unless I can get an extra edge.

21:18.902 --> 21:22.781
-Well, maybe I can help.
-You're gonna give me the job?

21:22.864 --> 21:24.325
Oh, hell no. You're terrible.

21:24.408 --> 21:28.036
But I will lend you the money,
at least for the first month.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.414
[chuckles] Really?

21:31.164 --> 21:34.751
-Even after what I did?
-Well, what can I say? I'm a saint.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.504
-I love you, too.
-[chuckles]

21:38.839 --> 21:42.133
But you have to promise that
I get to design your athletic wear line

21:42.217 --> 21:43.385
when you become a famous Olympian.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.304
-Yes. Deal.
-Okay.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.598
[chuckles]

21:57.691 --> 21:59.401
I sent Karima the photos.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.778
She says my school is way nicer than hers.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.698
She's totally jealous
of how awesome it is here.

22:04.781 --> 22:08.994
-I don't know about that.
-Well, I'd rather be here than Douma.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.301
[rap music playing]
