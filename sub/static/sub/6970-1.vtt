01:16.386 --> 01:17.880
Ow ! Damn !

01:37.569 --> 01:40.438
A bee just stung me, eh ?

01:44.385 --> 01:48.574
Well, now, don’t you
all take the cake ?

01:48.641 --> 01:50.713
Does your mom
ever mix you up ?

03:42.939 --> 03:45.110
I've come to you at great risk.
I mean you no harm.

03:45.178 --> 03:47.796
- He knows about your sister.
- How do I know you’re for real ?

03:47.866 --> 03:49.840
I can explain everything.

03:49.913 --> 03:52.783
First I want you to come
somewhere with me.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.865
I want you to come with me
to see my mother.

04:12.793 --> 04:15.214
Stay out of his way.
He doesn't want to hurt you.

04:15.288 --> 04:17.622
You can't use your gun !

04:17.688 --> 04:20.656
Stop right there, sir !

06:05.522 --> 06:07.016
Come on.

06:32.656 --> 06:36.398
- Mulder !
- Scully, get the car !

06:36.465 --> 06:38.472
This way.

06:59.728 --> 07:02.859
- Damn.

07:04.847 --> 07:06.887
This way.

08:48.777 --> 08:52.192
Hey ! Jeremiah !

08:55.593 --> 08:58.527
Jeremiah, stop !

08:58.633 --> 09:00.520
What are you doing ?

09:00.584 --> 09:02.918
There'll be more
right behind him.

09:02.985 --> 09:05.537
- You can't leave here !
- They'll kill me !

09:05.608 --> 09:08.805
I need your help !

09:08.872 --> 09:10.912
My mother is dying !

09:18.248 --> 09:21.990
Mulder ! Mulder !

09:47.494 --> 09:49.021
Mulder ?

09:51.813 --> 09:54.366
Mulder !

10:29.700 --> 10:32.067
Where are they going ?

10:32.131 --> 10:34.335
I don't know.

10:34.403 --> 10:36.443
I need to know.

10:38.531 --> 10:40.953
Please. I don't know.

11:17.473 --> 11:20.156
They'll know where to find us.
They'll be waiting for us.

11:20.225 --> 11:21.786
Who ?

11:21.857 --> 11:24.344
Your government men. They'll be waiting
at the hospital with your mother.

11:24.449 --> 11:26.969
What can they do ?
We're working in the light.

11:27.073 --> 11:29.855
They can't stop us without exposure,
without consequence.

11:29.952 --> 11:32.800
You have to understand something.
I must perish.

11:32.897 --> 11:35.679
Whatever the consequences
to that end,

11:35.744 --> 11:39.453
they are incalculable
to the preservation of the larger plan.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.008
The larger plan ?

11:43.552 --> 11:45.407
You mean colonization ?

11:45.472 --> 11:49.116
Hegemony, Mr. Mulder.
A new origin of species.

11:49.183 --> 11:51.419
- I don't understand.
- I can show you.

11:51.487 --> 11:55.765
My mother is dying. I need to
take you to see her right now.

11:55.839 --> 11:59.134
And if they are waiting for us,
if they’re willing to kill me...

11:59.199 --> 12:01.435
and face the consequences
of their actions,

12:01.503 --> 12:04.951
to stand before your ineffectual
justice system, I will be dead.

12:05.023 --> 12:07.389
I won't be able
to save your mother.

12:07.455 --> 12:11.131
The work will go on.
The plan will continue to be executed.

12:13.086 --> 12:15.868
- Or you can stop it.
- How can I stop it ?

12:15.934 --> 12:19.349
I can take you to a place, show you
the work in progress where you can see--

12:19.422 --> 12:21.909
No ! There's no time.

12:21.981 --> 12:23.836
Where you can see your sister.

12:38.013 --> 12:42.235
- He isn't coming.
- I told you.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.439
- Then where is he ?
- I don't know.

12:44.508 --> 12:49.330
Certainly he anticipated
we'd be here waiting.

12:50.812 --> 12:54.609
Unless we had
a security leak.

12:54.684 --> 12:56.309
Who ?

12:56.379 --> 12:59.674
I've come in receipt
of some pictures...

12:59.771 --> 13:01.975
of your visit to
Mrs. Mulder's summerhouse.

13:02.076 --> 13:04.214
Were you aware you were
being photographed?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.105
By whom ?

13:06.172 --> 13:10.394
I believe that can be determined
by a simple planting of information...

13:12.731 --> 13:15.000
to see where
that information fows.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.074
What information ?

13:18.266 --> 13:21.714
That Mrs. Mulder's life
is in danger.

13:21.787 --> 13:26.423
That, left unprotected, she
may come to an unnatural end.

13:40.313 --> 13:42.168
- Scully.

13:42.233 --> 13:45.015
Scully, it's me.
Where are you ?

13:45.081 --> 13:47.895
I'm right where you left me.
I'm sitting here in my car.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.848
Why ?

13:49.913 --> 13:53.655
Because you wouldn't answer your phone,
and I didn't know what else to do.

13:53.720 --> 13:58.160
- Are you okay ?
- Yes, I'm fine.

13:58.232 --> 14:00.883
Listen. There's going
to be people looking for me.

14:00.952 --> 14:02.643
They’re going to think
they can get tome through you.

14:02.712 --> 14:05.100
- Mulder--
- Hold on. Just listen for a second.

14:05.176 --> 14:07.086
I need you to do
something for me.

14:07.159 --> 14:09.014
I had to steal a car
from an airport in Alberta.

14:09.112 --> 14:11.054
There's going to be a record
of me going through Canadian customs.

14:11.159 --> 14:13.014
I need you
to cover my tracks.

14:13.079 --> 14:15.501
I also need you
to know I'm okay.

14:15.575 --> 14:18.871
I'm fine, okay ?

14:21.079 --> 14:23.446
- Mulder, he's coming after you.
- Who ?

14:23.511 --> 14:27.089
The man you left for dead.
He's alive.

14:40.982 --> 14:43.349
That's it for the gas.

14:48.693 --> 14:50.548
How much further from here ?

14:50.613 --> 14:52.522
About 20 miles.

14:54.421 --> 14:59.472
Maybe half that on foot
over those hills.

14:59.541 --> 15:01.483
Let's go.

15:15.028 --> 15:17.995
- Sir ?
- Agent Scully.

15:18.068 --> 15:20.686
I heard you were
looking for me.

15:20.756 --> 15:22.643
There's been some concern
about you and Agent Mulder.

15:22.708 --> 15:27.759
We're fine, sir. We've been searching
for this man, Jeremiah Smith.

15:27.828 --> 15:29.966
- Did you find him ?
- No.

15:33.715 --> 15:37.162
I received a memo from you that
there's more confusion about this man.

15:37.235 --> 15:40.847
That the Social Security Administration
has five men with this name...

15:40.947 --> 15:43.052
working in branch offices
around the country...

15:43.154 --> 15:45.642
with identical photo I.D.'s.

15:45.746 --> 15:48.168
We ran a check on these men.

15:48.274 --> 15:50.794
All five have not reported
to work in three days.

15:50.866 --> 15:54.249
Would you or Agent Mulder like to let me
in on what it is your suspicions are ?

15:54.322 --> 15:57.900
I'm afraid we haven't exactly formulated
any clear suspicions, sir.

15:57.970 --> 16:01.101
- Well, we have, Agent Scully.
- Sir ?

16:01.170 --> 16:03.471
We were able to download
the hard drive data...

16:03.537 --> 16:06.505
from each of the five missing men's
Social Security workstations.

16:06.577 --> 16:08.716
In each case, we found
an enormous amount of files and data...

16:08.785 --> 16:11.468
that cannot be identified,
do not correspond...

16:11.569 --> 16:13.641
with any kind of accounting
or document collection...

16:13.745 --> 16:16.112
done as normal
departmental business.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.597
The data was all locked
in password files.

16:18.705 --> 16:20.493
How much of it is there ?

16:20.560 --> 16:24.357
Enough to fill seven ten-gigabyte
hard drives. Roughly a billion entries.

16:24.432 --> 16:27.334
It appears to be some kind of
personal record keeping or accounting.

16:27.409 --> 16:29.448
Could it be some kind
of cryptogram ?

16:29.520 --> 16:31.462
If it is, I can't crack it.

16:31.536 --> 16:34.405
I'd like to get a copy
of a portion of this.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.644
- I might be able to figure it out.
- Seriously ?

16:37.712 --> 16:40.363
Maybe. There's somebody
I want to run it by.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.952
- Agent Mulder ?
- No.

16:43.023 --> 16:46.023
I think, sir, this is more along
my field of expertise.

17:11.021 --> 17:12.876
What happened to this man ?

17:12.941 --> 17:15.462
I wouldn't touch the body,
Mr. Mulder.

17:30.668 --> 17:33.385
There’s a work order here.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.321
It's for yesterday.

17:38.380 --> 17:40.715
He's only been here
a little more than 24 hours.

17:42.636 --> 17:45.571
You know what killed him,
don’t you ?

17:48.268 --> 17:51.464
It's not much further.

18:10.986 --> 18:13.474
You're looking at the future,
Mr. Mulder.

18:17.578 --> 18:19.433
What is it ?

18:19.498 --> 18:22.465
A flowering shrub.

18:22.538 --> 18:27.011
But its specific epithet can't be found
on any of your taxonomic charts.

18:28.042 --> 18:30.016
Being grown for what ?

18:30.089 --> 18:32.991
Pollen.

18:38.793 --> 18:41.575
What is this ?

18:44.296 --> 18:46.914
- What's going on here ?
- What did I tell you ?

18:46.985 --> 18:49.668
That looks just like my sister.

18:52.904 --> 18:56.516
But that's not possible. She's no older
than the day she was taken.

19:01.255 --> 19:03.165
Samantha ?

19:07.079 --> 19:08.934
Samantha ?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.503
Samantha ?

19:13.575 --> 19:15.430
Samantha ?

19:16.647 --> 19:18.622
Samantha ?

19:18.694 --> 19:20.931
Samantha, it's me.

19:23.175 --> 19:25.149
It's me, Fox, your brother.

19:30.342 --> 19:33.408
Do you remember me ?

19:35.270 --> 19:38.565
- What's wrong with her ?
- She has no language.

19:38.630 --> 19:40.931
What do you mean ?

19:40.998 --> 19:44.510
She's a drone, Mr. Mulder,
a worker.

19:46.373 --> 19:48.762
What are you talking about ?

19:48.837 --> 19:52.252
There's more you should see
so that you might understand.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.561
How'd they get here ?

20:25.635 --> 20:28.482
They're stationed here.
They're part of an agrarian workforce.

20:30.851 --> 20:34.080
- Who takes care of them ?
- They take care of themselves.

20:34.147 --> 20:37.659
Parenting is unnecessary,
a needless division of energy.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.184
They're clones.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.388
Serial ovotypes.

20:59.457 --> 21:01.628
Have you seen enough ?

21:01.697 --> 21:04.283
We can't stay around here
much longer.

21:07.168 --> 21:10.332
I'll go see
if I can find some gas.

22:05.885 --> 22:08.787
Open the door, Agent Scully.

22:13.405 --> 22:16.820
-How did you know I was here ?
-I've been trying to reach Agent Mulder.

22:16.925 --> 22:19.227
I watched you enter the building.
Where is he ?

22:19.293 --> 22:21.148
I don't know.

22:21.213 --> 22:24.529
I have information for him,
a matter that would concern him greatly.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.741
- Concern him how ?
- Concerning his mother.

22:26.812 --> 22:30.074
- Has something happened to her ?
- No.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.279
- No, not yet.
- Is she in danger?

22:32.348 --> 22:35.414
I prefer to speak
with Agent Mulder directly.

22:35.484 --> 22:38.200
Let me just say
she is unprotected.

22:38.268 --> 22:40.755
From whom ?

22:40.828 --> 22:43.348
From whom ?

22:43.419 --> 22:45.688
If you want to involve
yourself, Agent Scully,

22:45.755 --> 22:48.406
you might do well to give
this information to your partner.

22:48.508 --> 22:51.442
Not until you give me
some information first.

22:54.459 --> 22:57.209
These are data entries taken
from Social Security records.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.162
You're going in
the wrong direction.

22:59.226 --> 23:01.681
All beginning with
the letters S.E.P.

23:03.738 --> 23:07.284
You know what these are.
Confirm or deny.

23:08.794 --> 23:11.379
Smallpox eradication program.

23:11.449 --> 23:13.905
Smallpox.

23:13.977 --> 23:17.654
Don't unlock doors you're
not prepared to go through.

23:17.721 --> 23:22.031
- What's that supposed to mean ?
- Leave it alone.

23:22.137 --> 23:24.559
Protect the mother.

23:32.153 --> 23:34.008
What are you doing ?

23:34.073 --> 23:36.244
- She's coming with us.
- You can't do this.

23:36.312 --> 23:38.516
- She's not your sister.
- Then who is she ?

23:38.584 --> 23:42.740
You have a chance here to understand
something so much greater,

23:42.808 --> 23:45.175
to comprehend it,
to expose it.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.502
Then explain it to me.
Explain it to me now !

24:28.245 --> 24:30.449
- Bees.
- It's an apiary.

24:30.517 --> 24:32.372
Are bees what killed
that man we found ?

24:32.437 --> 24:33.997
Yes.

24:34.069 --> 24:35.662
It's probably not a good idea
to hide in there.

24:35.733 --> 24:38.351
- You have no immunity to them.
- But you do ?

24:55.796 --> 24:58.513
Somebody lead me.
I can't see anything.

25:23.059 --> 25:25.164
Is that the only way out ?

25:31.474 --> 25:33.678
I think we’ve walked
into our own trap.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.919
- Come on !

27:28.332 --> 27:30.372
- You busy, Agent Pendrell ?
- No, I was just, uh--

27:30.443 --> 27:33.509
Good, because I think I've
made some headway on this data.

27:33.612 --> 27:35.467
- Can you call up the files ?
- Yeah.

27:35.532 --> 27:38.379
I've got to tell you
I've gotten nowhere.

27:38.443 --> 27:40.548
S.E.P. Smallpox
eradication program.

27:40.619 --> 27:42.594
Smallpox ?
How'd you figure that ?

27:42.667 --> 27:44.968
I got lucky, but the key is in
this first string of letters.

27:45.034 --> 27:48.231
Twenty-letter strings,
30 different variations.

27:48.299 --> 27:50.819
You say a 20-letter code to any
scientist, and they immediately think...

27:50.891 --> 27:53.193
protein amino acid sequence code,
which is what this turned out to be.

27:53.259 --> 27:55.560
Protein sequence code
for what ?

27:55.626 --> 28:00.165
The cowpox virus, the virus used
to inoculate humans against smallpox.

28:00.234 --> 28:04.741
Okay, right. So these guys were keeping
records of smallpox inoculations. Why ?

28:04.841 --> 28:07.208
I haven't worked that out yet.

28:07.306 --> 28:11.877
But the big question is this
second alphanumeric string-- 1 5 digits.

28:11.946 --> 28:15.742
Yeah. I checked. Each one is different.
An infinite number of variations.

28:15.817 --> 28:18.948
- An inventory.
- Of what ?

28:19.017 --> 28:21.122
Of us.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.108
With all due respect,
Agent Scully,

28:27.176 --> 28:30.525
it looks like something
from the Hubble Telescope.

28:30.601 --> 28:35.172
Actually, it's an image created
by what's called a confocal microscope.

28:35.240 --> 28:39.037
You're looking at a three-dimensional
picture of the location of a protein.

28:39.112 --> 28:41.981
In this case, cowpox
structural protein number six.

28:42.088 --> 28:45.404
It's one of the inoculants
used in the smallpox vaccine.

28:45.511 --> 28:47.999
- Where'd it come from ?
- From me.

28:48.072 --> 28:53.603
I had a biopsy taken from the smallpox
vaccination scar on my upper arm.

28:53.671 --> 28:56.005
Through a process called
immunohistochemical staining...

28:56.071 --> 28:59.932
and through the addition of an antibody
for the cowpox virus six,

29:00.007 --> 29:03.585
I was able to get this picture
of the location of a protein--

29:03.654 --> 29:06.621
a single, nonrandom
protein pattern.

29:06.694 --> 29:09.760
I'm not a scientist, and I don't know
that many people in this room--

29:09.862 --> 29:14.401
What I'm saying is that
I think this protein is a tag,

29:14.470 --> 29:16.836
some kind of genetic marker
that was applied to me...

29:16.934 --> 29:19.236
when I was inoculated
against smallpox as a child.

29:19.302 --> 29:21.571
Why you ?

29:21.637 --> 29:25.892
Not just me, all of us,

29:25.957 --> 29:29.732
quite possibly anybody who’s been
inoculated over the past 50 years.

29:29.797 --> 29:33.212
Agent Scully,
frankly this sounds like...

29:33.285 --> 29:36.384
something we might have
expected from Agent Mulder.

29:36.453 --> 29:41.187
I had my doubts,
and I'm still not certain.

29:41.252 --> 29:44.318
But I performed the same
procedure on Agent Pendrell.

29:48.036 --> 29:52.706
The location of the protein from
his biopsy should be identical to mine,

29:52.772 --> 29:55.106
but it's slightly different,

29:55.172 --> 29:57.790
which might correspond
to the alphanumeric entries...

29:57.859 --> 30:00.706
collected by the men at the, uh,
Social Security Administration.

30:00.772 --> 30:06.074
So what you’re saying is we're being
cataloged, tagged and inventoried ?

30:06.147 --> 30:08.732
- By who ?
- I don't know.

30:08.803 --> 30:10.778
But it would have to be
a government agency.

30:10.851 --> 30:13.818
- And to what purpose ?
- I don't know that either.

30:13.923 --> 30:15.778
I think the only man
who might be able...

30:15.843 --> 30:18.264
to give us that information
is Jeremiah Smith.

30:23.938 --> 30:28.672
Agent Scully, can I see you
outside for a moment ? Alone.

30:38.945 --> 30:41.760
Do you realize what
you're promoting in there ?

30:41.825 --> 30:44.694
You're rounding these people up in
the middle of a workday to imply that--

30:44.769 --> 30:48.762
I am a scientist. What I'm promoting
in there is reductive evidence.

30:48.865 --> 30:51.963
It's the reason I was assigned to the
X files in the first place, is it not ?

30:52.032 --> 30:54.236
To put Agent Mulder's work
to the test of science ?

30:56.992 --> 30:58.847
Excuse me.

30:58.912 --> 31:01.214
- Scully.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.036
Where are you right now ?

31:03.104 --> 31:06.006
I'm in Skinner's office.
Where are you ?

31:06.080 --> 31:07.934
I'm still in Canada,
but I'm catching a plane soon.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.520
-I need you to meet me on the other end.
-Just tell me where.

31:10.592 --> 31:13.275
- At the hospital where my mother is.
- Mulder, I don't--

31:13.343 --> 31:15.994
Her life depends upon me and
my party getting there safely.

31:16.095 --> 31:20.285
- Who ?
-Jeremiah Smith and someone else.

31:21.663 --> 31:23.518
I'm gonna need some protection.

31:23.583 --> 31:27.031
- Believe me, you're going to have it.
- What do you mean ?

31:27.103 --> 31:29.753
There's a lot of people who
want to talk to Jeremiah Smith.

31:29.822 --> 31:31.164
They'll get their chance.

31:31.230 --> 31:33.117
- We’ll be there.

31:45.758 --> 31:50.067
Please.
You can't kill him. He can't die.

31:50.173 --> 31:51.449
He must.

31:51.517 --> 31:53.241
That girl is my sister.

31:53.309 --> 31:56.156
He shows you pieces,
but tells you nothing of the whole,

31:56.221 --> 31:58.109
because he's inconsequential,

31:58.173 --> 32:00.377
a traitor to the project.

32:00.445 --> 32:02.332
Kill me. Let them go.

32:02.397 --> 32:05.212
- You'd trade your life for his ?
- For my mother's.

32:09.821 --> 32:11.763
Everything dies.

32:33.883 --> 32:36.021
He's in touch with the perimeter.

32:36.091 --> 32:39.703
I’m sorry, sir. For security reasons--

32:39.771 --> 32:42.935
Five hours we're out here
swinging in the wind, Agent Scully.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.392
Something's wrong.
Something happened.

32:45.466 --> 32:47.473
You don't have anyway
of getting a hold of him ?

32:47.546 --> 32:49.368
This is beginning
to seriously compromise...

32:49.435 --> 32:51.801
our ability to treat patients.

32:51.898 --> 32:55.891
Just moment, sir.

32:55.994 --> 32:58.001
Oh, my God ! Mulder ?

33:01.594 --> 33:05.205
I can't. There's nothing--

33:05.273 --> 33:09.048
Mulder, you're fr-- No.
You're freezing.

33:09.113 --> 33:12.244
- He's in shock-- You're in shock.
- What happened ?

33:27.256 --> 33:29.776
She'll never know.

33:36.056 --> 33:37.910
She'll never know.

35:29.138 --> 35:33.415
We could have
saved her, Scully.

35:33.521 --> 35:36.783
As long as she’s lying here,
you can't give up on her.

35:36.849 --> 35:40.144
I don't care what
the doctors say.

35:43.889 --> 35:49.191
I had one chance,
and I let it slip away.

35:49.264 --> 35:54.349
You don't know that. You can't blame
yourself for what you could only hope.

35:54.416 --> 35:59.751
He took me to a place
with green fields,

35:59.856 --> 36:02.092
and I saw my sister.

36:05.071 --> 36:08.966
She was just a little girl.

36:12.111 --> 36:15.046
I've seen too many things
not to believe.

36:16.078 --> 36:19.755
I've seen things, too,

36:19.822 --> 36:23.237
but there are answers
to be found now.

36:23.310 --> 36:27.401
We have hope that there's a place
to start. That's what I believe.

36:27.470 --> 36:32.489
You put such faith
in your science, Scully, but...

36:32.590 --> 36:35.885
the things I've seen, science
provides no place to start.

36:35.982 --> 36:39.560
Nothing happens
in contradiction to nature,

36:39.629 --> 36:42.018
only in contradiction
to what we know of it.

36:42.094 --> 36:44.876
And that’s
a place to start.

36:45.934 --> 36:48.039
That's where the hope is.

36:56.716 --> 36:59.498
I feel I came so close.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.598
I feel it too.

37:02.668 --> 37:04.872
I know it.

37:04.972 --> 37:09.063
- How ?
- I was warned...

37:09.131 --> 37:12.808
by a man we both know,

37:12.875 --> 37:16.672
who I believe
knows the truth,

37:16.748 --> 37:21.537
who can lead us
to a place to start.

38:10.216 --> 38:12.387
Mr. Mulder ?

38:12.456 --> 38:15.522
My name is Marita Covarrubias.

38:15.592 --> 38:17.447
I am the assistant
to the special representative.

38:17.512 --> 38:20.000
Was he able to review
the material I sent him ?

38:20.072 --> 38:22.177
- Yes.
- And will he see me ?

38:22.248 --> 38:26.754
I'm afraid he's been called
into something important.

38:26.824 --> 38:29.573
- Can I ask who sent you here ?
- A friend.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.087
I've been inquiring with each
of the special representatives...

38:33.159 --> 38:35.330
all month about
the farmland in Canada.

38:35.399 --> 38:37.701
I've been trying to get some reasons,
and all I've gotten are dead ends.

38:37.767 --> 38:40.549
I can tell you that farm
has been abandoned.

38:40.615 --> 38:43.517
The crops you described
were left to die.

38:43.623 --> 38:46.492
But they have been
identified as ginseng.

38:46.598 --> 38:49.380
No evidence of beehives
or bee husbandry was found.

38:51.462 --> 38:53.917
I know it's not
the answer you wanted.

38:53.990 --> 38:57.732
No. I, uh--

38:57.798 --> 39:00.613
Can I ask why this is
so important to you ?

39:03.398 --> 39:09.061
I have suffered-- I've suffered
some very personal losses recently and--

39:12.806 --> 39:15.391
I was-- I was hoping...

39:17.797 --> 39:20.350
that, um--

39:34.724 --> 39:37.277
Not everything dies,
Mr. Mulder.

40:05.794 --> 40:09.111
I need to know the reasons
why this should be.

40:09.186 --> 40:11.194
So that the work may continue,

40:13.634 --> 40:16.700
so that the project
may proceed unabated...

40:16.802 --> 40:18.689
by removing
an unnecessary obstacle.

40:18.786 --> 40:20.608
What obstacle ?

40:20.673 --> 40:22.942
Agent Mulder, actually.

40:25.473 --> 40:27.928
If his mother were
to die, he would--

40:28.001 --> 40:29.789
He what ?

40:29.857 --> 40:32.574
You see,

40:32.640 --> 40:36.120
the fiercest enemy is the man
who has nothing left to lose.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.782
And you know how important
Agent Mulder is to the equation.
