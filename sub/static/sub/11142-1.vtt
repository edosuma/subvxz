WEBVTT

00:44.837 --> 00:49.331
T.w.a. Flight number 817,
now arriving gate 12.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.834
This is the final boarding call

00:53.846 --> 00:56.508
for t.W.A. Flight number 716.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.473
This is
the final boarding call...

00:59.477 --> 01:00.512
Taxi.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.472
For t.W.A. Flight number 716.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.220
Where to?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.689
- Willowpoint falls, please.
- You got it.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.778
You know,
my wife's gonna have a fit

01:16.785 --> 01:18.571
when I tell her
that you were in my cab.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.069
Because she reads everything.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.570
She reads all the time.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.322
She read your last book,

01:23.334 --> 01:24.870
what did you call it,
"a fog in the night"?

01:24.877 --> 01:26.458
Right.

01:26.462 --> 01:28.248
It scared the living daylights
out of her.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.463
I told her, "take it easy.
It's just a story."

01:33.552 --> 01:35.338
I hear they're gonna
make a movie.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.052
Yeah, that's right.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.842
That's great.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.177
Small town boy
makes good, right?

01:41.727 --> 01:43.342
So tell me,

01:43.354 --> 01:45.345
what's it like
living in Los Angeles?

01:46.732 --> 01:48.097
It's different.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.266
Yeah.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.532
Uh, would you pull in here
for a minute, please?

02:35.906 --> 02:37.271
You knew them?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.405
A long time ago.

02:50.588 --> 02:53.955
You don't really believe all that
spooky stuff you write about, do you?

03:10.816 --> 03:14.354
Willowpoint falls was just like
any other small town.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.070
At least, that's
the way it seemed to me.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.187
Hey, Chuck, where's my paper?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.485
Where's my paper?
Where's my paper?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.734
Will you guys wait 2A minute?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.652
I got this whole counter
to take care of.

04:02.660 --> 04:03.991
Why am I getting you coffee?

04:03.994 --> 04:05.674
You should be drinking milk
for god's sake.

04:05.829 --> 04:06.944
Hey, Rosie, how about a fork?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.536
Use your wife's, ok?

04:08.540 --> 04:11.327
Mary, she calls in sick,
I'm the one who's stuck here.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.041
5:30 I come in this morning.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.706
These people
don't care when I come.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.499
Come on, will you.
Come on, come on.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.418
Man: Where's my eggs?
=I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.841
What're you doing in here?

04:27.726 --> 04:31.344
The city was 25 miles
southwest of town.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.596
And on a clear day,
you could see

04:33.607 --> 04:36.269
the skyscrapers
reaching for the clouds.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.908
It was Halloween, 1962.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.869
That was the year
she came into my life.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.459
And willowpoint
would never be the same.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.677
Frankie, where you going?

05:51.977 --> 05:53.808
To school.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.427
Why you no eat something?

05:55.439 --> 05:56.929
I'm not hungry.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.352
Mama: Stupid children.

06:00.736 --> 06:01.942
Frankie.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.281
Don't you want
to take this with you?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.869
Thanks, dad.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.329
Hey.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.635
Bye, dad.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.521
You've got
the prettiest brown eyes.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.986
Come on, get up. Get up.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.496
Shh. Silencio. Silencio, eh?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.625
See you, grandpa.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.918
Charlie!

07:08.095 --> 07:11.178
- Go easy on him, ma.
- Oh, sure.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.770
Where'd you get
those cigarettes?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.487
What cigarettes?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.449
I am on firel

08:29.885 --> 08:31.421
Hi, Mrs. chuley.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.013
Hey! Don't get run over!

08:47.069 --> 08:48.900
Hey, watch it.
What're you doing?

08:48.904 --> 08:50.485
Get out of my way!

08:52.991 --> 08:56.154
J ave Maria j

08:58.080 --> 09:00.412
ignore him. Children.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.872
Get out of the way!

09:04.252 --> 09:05.867
No, children, stop.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.131
J ave j

09:53.176 --> 09:56.259
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Sorry, Frankie.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.629
What're you trying to do?
Kill me?

09:59.224 --> 10:00.885
And don't swear!

10:00.892 --> 10:03.884
Meangya, don't be such a holy roller.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.806
Are you hurt?

10:05.814 --> 10:07.770
What's that look like? Ketchup?

10:09.067 --> 10:11.433
Look, don't tell dad.
He'll kill me.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.403
Good. Then maybe I'll get
to live a normal life!

10:25.000 --> 10:28.492
Don't worry. I won't tell dad.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.521
Where are you going?

10:50.525 --> 10:52.641
I'm gonna buy
some toilet paper and soap.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.983
It's Halloween.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.978
I've got a reputation
to live up to.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.425
Stop that noise.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.721
Now get down.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.300
You go back to your place.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.485
And now,
class, Frankie scarlatti

12:26.496 --> 12:30.239
has written a new story,
especially for this occasion.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.078
Frankie.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.140
"The beast that
destroyed London"

12:49.144 --> 12:50.725
by Frankie scarlatti.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.890
- Ooh!
- Be quiet.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.525
“Once upon a time,
in a city called London,

12:58.528 --> 13:02.737
"a horrible sea monster
terrified the citizens

13:02.741 --> 13:05.778
"just because he wanted to.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.152
"One day,
the prehysterical beast

13:09.164 --> 13:12.873
"Rose from the watery depths,
covered with seaweed

13:13.043 --> 13:16.126
"and began to swallow
the London citizens

13:16.129 --> 13:17.585
by the dozen."

13:17.797 --> 13:19.537
Did he brush with crest
to prevent cavities?

13:20.759 --> 13:22.750
Be quiet, Donald.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.302
“The London bridge

13:26.306 --> 13:30.470
"crumpled under the
monster's huge lizard feet.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.969
"The citizens were trampled on
by the hundreds.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.221
"And if I told you
what that looked like,

13:36.399 --> 13:38.811
"you'd probably throw up.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.277
“But just when
everyone had given up,

13:50.288 --> 13:53.780
"thrown in the towel
and really become depressed,

13:53.792 --> 13:55.828
"a miracle occurred.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.201
“The ground began to open up

13:58.213 --> 13:59.828
"and the monster,

13:59.839 --> 14:02.706
"who weighed at
least a million tons,

14:02.717 --> 14:04.924
"sank into the huge hole.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.420
"Eaten up by the only thing
bigger than him:

14:08.431 --> 14:09.887
"The earth.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.592
"And the depressed citizens
of London

14:13.603 --> 14:15.719
"applauded and cheered

14:15.730 --> 14:17.311
"and there was nothing

14:17.315 --> 14:19.397
to be frightened about anymore."

14:28.827 --> 14:30.909
“That is, of course,

14:30.912 --> 14:33.904
"unless the monster had a baby.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.871
"But that's impossible.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.670
Or is it?"

14:55.603 --> 15:00.267
Thank you, Frankie,
for that very unusual story.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.941
And now, people,

15:03.945 --> 15:06.357
you may go to the cloakroom
to get your coats.

15:06.364 --> 15:09.197
Alphabetically.
“A” through "e," please.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.492
And have a safe
and happy Halloween.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.236
All right. Let's go.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.544
Hey, what're you doing?
That's Frankie's cap.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.167
Duh.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.545
Now we'll see how
brave Frankie really is.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.015
Oh! And remember
to dress warmly on Monday.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.308
They're installing a new furnace

15:41.316 --> 15:43.728
and we may be
without heat for a while.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.728
You wanna go trick-or-treat?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.366
I really liked
vour story, Frankie.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.875
Thanks.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.928
I wish I was as weird as you.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.570
Frankie?

16:37.789 --> 16:40.952
Thank you for helping me
after school today, Frankie.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.495
That's ok.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.744
So, when do I get those
greeting cards I ordered?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.586
Mr. lowry said

16:49.175 --> 16:51.382
since they've got to come
all the way from Nebraska,

16:51.386 --> 16:55.004
it'll probably be
after Thanksgiving.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.346
Well, Mr. lowry's
certainly been a postman

16:57.350 --> 16:58.931
long enough to know.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.426
Yeah. I had to sell 24 boxes.

17:03.648 --> 17:07.482
It was hard, but luckily
my dad bought the last 10.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.443
Frankie, you should be
very proud of yourself.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.858
You're a very
enterprising young man

17:12.866 --> 17:15.323
for your age,
and that's very unusual.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.612
I know.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.421
Thank you, Frankie.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.511
And say hello
to your father for me.

17:38.099 --> 17:42.012
Ask him to call me sometime.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.851
I'm in the book.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.436
It's under "grace."

17:46.858 --> 17:49.144
Grace la della. Page 39.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.145
Would you like me
to write that down for you?

17:54.157 --> 17:57.194
No. That's ok. I'll tell him.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.493
Hey, Frankie!

18:11.841 --> 18:14.457
Ok, ok. Here he comes.
Just do what I told you.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.709
Let me do the talking.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.599
Hi, guys.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.963
Hey, Frankie,
that was an ok story.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.475
Real cool, man.

18:27.482 --> 18:31.976
Jeez, it's getting colder
than a witch's tit out here.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.602
Yeah. It's cold enough
to snow I'll bet.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.113
Hey Frankie,

18:37.116 --> 18:38.856
ain't you got something
to keep your head warm?

18:38.868 --> 18:42.702
Yeah. My dad bought me
this new ski cap, and... and...

18:46.834 --> 18:48.574
Oh, no.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.328
Well, what's the matter?

18:52.340 --> 18:54.001
I must've lost it.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.086
What do you mean?

18:56.094 --> 18:59.882
I put it in my pocket,
and now it's gone.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.050
Oh. It probably fell out
in the cloakroom.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.514
How much you wanna bet?

19:05.770 --> 19:07.226
I'm going home.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.514
Hey, where's he going?
=t don't know.

19:11.526 --> 19:12.891
Wait a minute!

19:14.445 --> 19:16.606
Frankie, where're you going?
What about your hat?

19:16.614 --> 19:18.570
I'll get it tomorrow.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.281
I can't go back in there now.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.071
Miss la della already left.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.034
So what? The door's still open.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.074
Besides if Williams,
the janitor, gets it,

19:26.249 --> 19:29.082
he might give it to one of those
nigger kids he's got.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.121
The word is "negro," Donald.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.165
Sorry, "negro, Donald."

19:33.172 --> 19:35.754
Forgot that
vou're in love with one.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.544
I mean, that's what
she looks like to me

19:37.552 --> 19:39.088
with all that brillo hair.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.926
Whose hair?

19:40.930 --> 19:43.171
Oh, wow.
Who do you think, lover boy?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.343
Mary Ellen paio.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.232
Jeez.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.067
I wish I were in love.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.150
I'm going to get my cap.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.815
Donald, get up, man.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.408
What is it? Hey, w-what is...

20:04.412 --> 20:05.777
- Come on.
- What? W-where'd he go?

20:05.788 --> 20:08.325
He... he went back in the room.
Come on.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.538
- Yeah!
- All right.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.755
Hey, guys! What's going on?

23:13.434 --> 23:16.426
Hey, guys. Let me out of here.

24:15.705 --> 24:20.244
The bells of Saint Andrew's
were soothingly familiar,

24:20.251 --> 24:23.618
even in those
unfamiliar surroundings.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.626
And it wasn't long
before I drifted to sleep

24:28.301 --> 24:30.713
comforted by
their ancient voices.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.802
And I began to dream.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.761
I dreamt of my mother's funeral.

25:17.433 --> 25:18.923
Marianna: Frankie.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.701
Marianna,
is dinner almost ready?

25:39.705 --> 25:42.617
- Yeah, mom, I'm hungry.
- Ok, just a minute, guys.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.332
Show me your stuff.

25:45.336 --> 25:49.079
There you are.
Come over here, you.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.081
Look at this. It's finished.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.041
Try it on. Here.

25:57.974 --> 25:59.259
Let's see.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.138
You look very handsome.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.693
Don't leave.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.074
How could I ever leave you?

26:51.819 --> 26:54.777
It was all hallows Eve,

26:54.780 --> 26:59.365
and I, still locked behind
the cloakroom door,

26:59.368 --> 27:02.610
suddenly felt a wind
sweep through the darkness,

27:03.330 --> 27:05.696
chilling me to the bone.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.701
Where is it? Where's my present?

27:10.713 --> 27:12.829
Where did you hide it this time?

27:16.844 --> 27:19.677
Of course I know
who gave me this dress.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.420
You did.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.798
I know your favorite song, too.

27:23.809 --> 27:29.429
J have you ever
seen a dream walking? J;

27:29.440 --> 27:32.102
j; Well, I did! J

27:32.109 --> 27:37.979
I did you ever hear
a dream talking? J

27:38.199 --> 27:41.282
j; Well, I did! J

27:41.285 --> 27:43.025
because you're
always singing it,

27:43.037 --> 27:44.948
that's how I know.

27:44.955 --> 27:48.447
I did you ever see a dream... j

27:51.837 --> 27:53.168
who are you?

28:01.597 --> 28:03.087
I'm scared now.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.714
No, I don't want to
play anymore.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.216
I want my mommy.
I want to go home.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.149
Help!

28:16.821 --> 28:18.732
No. Don't hurt her.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.610
Don't.

28:25.496 --> 28:28.033
Mommy!

28:30.167 --> 28:31.907
Please, don't.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.256
Who are you?

31:27.344 --> 31:28.880
What do you know?

31:29.930 --> 31:31.261
I got locked in.

31:31.265 --> 31:34.177
My friends locked me
in after school, and...

31:50.242 --> 31:54.576
The heart sound was fading,
becoming faint, more distant.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.411
I was dying.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.155
I could feel my eyes close shut

31:58.167 --> 31:59.703
and yet I continued to see.

32:43.337 --> 32:46.955
I saw my father waiting for me
to return home from school,

32:46.965 --> 32:49.832
worriedly dialing numbers
to try and locate me.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.678
I saw my brother geno, sadly sifting
through my toys and clothes

32:58.685 --> 33:01.392
and finding the love letter
I'd written to Mary Ellen.

33:01.397 --> 33:03.604
Why didn't I give it to her?

33:17.454 --> 33:19.820
And then I heard
Donald and Louie

33:19.832 --> 33:22.073
laughing at
the clever joke they'd played.

33:22.084 --> 33:24.450
But then their laughter
turned to tears

33:24.461 --> 33:26.827
as they stood
before a gravestone.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.838
Donald, Louie?

33:53.532 --> 33:56.023
And then I felt the chill again.

33:57.244 --> 34:00.156
And with it,
came the little girl.

34:18.599 --> 34:20.510
Who are you?

34:21.810 --> 34:23.721
Frankie.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.020
Who are you?

34:29.650 --> 34:30.982
Melissa.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.688
Where are you going?

34:38.034 --> 34:39.616
Where am I going?

34:43.831 --> 34:46.699
Don't you know
where you'd like to be going?

34:48.170 --> 34:51.333
To my home. In my own bed.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.720
My mommy's lost
and I can't find her.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.972
Will you help me find her?

35:35.217 --> 35:37.173
Daddy's here. It's ok.

35:37.177 --> 35:39.088
Ray, do you read me? Over.

35:39.555 --> 35:40.761
Ray?

35:40.764 --> 35:42.425
What's going on out there?

35:51.567 --> 35:52.727
What... what is this?

36:01.368 --> 36:03.199
What're you doing here, Willie?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.694
- Nothing, sheriff.
- You been here all night?

36:05.706 --> 36:07.947
- I took a little nap.
- What've you been drinking?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.405
Does Matty know where you're at?

36:09.501 --> 36:10.661
Somebody should call her.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.414
Take him to the station.
We'll talk when you get sober.

36:13.422 --> 36:15.003
I ain't done nothing...

36:15.007 --> 36:17.007
Go on. Go on. I'll talk to
you in a little bit, ok?

36:38.655 --> 36:40.737
All right, come on,
let's go home, folks.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.481
It's late. Come on.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.310
How you feeling?

37:12.314 --> 37:14.350
Feel better now?

37:14.358 --> 37:16.314
Sure he's all right.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.149
Just like my new wristwatch.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.236
“Takes a licking
and keeps on ticking," huh?

37:21.239 --> 37:22.649
Shut up, you.

37:22.824 --> 37:25.611
Who cares about vour wristwatch?

37:25.619 --> 37:27.655
Stop smoke, before you die, too.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.820
Who to die? Nobody to die.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.914
Never mind. Go find your son

37:32.918 --> 37:36.376
and say that
Frankie is wake up now.

37:36.380 --> 37:40.043
When I die,
no smoke's gonna kill me.

37:40.050 --> 37:42.462
It's you who gonna kill me.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.512
Phil: Hey, al.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.732
Your son wants to talk to you.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.383
Hi, dad.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.658
What am I gonna do with you?

38:50.537 --> 38:53.244
Dad, it wasn't my fault.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.746
Donald and Louie locked me in.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.537
I thought I'd lost my cap...

38:57.544 --> 38:59.751
I know all about it.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.713
When you didn't show up,
I made some calls.

39:03.717 --> 39:06.083
Your buddy Louie
finally confessed.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.093
Dad,

39:09.097 --> 39:12.464
something incredible happened
while I was in there.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.471
I know.

39:16.563 --> 39:17.848
You do?

39:19.483 --> 39:22.190
Frankie, you weren't breathing
when we got there.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.441
Do you have any idea
who hurt you?

39:28.492 --> 39:30.153
It was a man.

39:30.911 --> 39:32.367
What did he look like?

39:33.497 --> 39:36.989
It was too dark.
I couldn't see his face.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.703
Dad?

39:42.088 --> 39:45.797
- Something else happened.
- Get a load of this.

39:45.801 --> 39:48.588
The toad's a celebrity,
a big star.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.881
Who told them I was 10?

39:55.685 --> 39:57.425
Listen to that voice.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.849
Now he even sounds like a toad.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.812
Geno, how many times
have I told you

40:01.817 --> 40:03.682
not to call vour brother names.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.308
I wasn't calling him names.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.231
You was, too, geno.
You called him a frog.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.275
I didn't call him a frog.
I called him a toad.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.113
What's the difference?

40:11.117 --> 40:13.073
I give up. Where's the food?

40:15.497 --> 40:17.283
Charlie, go smoke a cigarette.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.322
Stop making trouble. Go ahead.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.416
Oh.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.785
First she tells me
I'm gonna die from smoke,

40:23.797 --> 40:25.788
and now she's gonna sing
at my funeral.

40:25.799 --> 40:28.290
Right. I'm not only going
to sing at your funeral

40:28.301 --> 40:30.166
I'm going to throw
on top the dirt

40:30.178 --> 40:32.169
so I get rid of vou in my face.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.391
- Bye, grandpa.
- Shut up.

40:43.024 --> 40:45.185
It's all there. Whole story.

40:45.193 --> 40:48.310
11 kids molested and killed
in the past 10 years.

40:48.321 --> 40:49.902
They're all from the city

40:49.906 --> 40:53.319
except for the first
one and Richie cilak.

40:53.326 --> 40:55.408
You remember Richie,
don't you, toad?

40:55.412 --> 40:56.993
Uh-uh.

40:56.997 --> 40:58.453
We were in
the 6th grade together.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.163
He was the class brain.
Got “a's” with his eyes closed.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.203
Probably would've been
a doctor or lawyer,

41:03.211 --> 41:04.872
something brainy like that.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.791
Just think, toad,
vou could've made it

41:06.798 --> 41:08.629
an even dozen
and really been famous.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.089
That's enough.

41:11.511 --> 41:14.548
That's it.
No more crazy stories.

41:14.723 --> 41:17.806
I was just kiddin' around,
trying to lighten things up.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.346
- It's not funny, geno.
- Don"t you have chores to do?

41:23.899 --> 41:26.857
Sorry, Frankie.
I didn't mean it.

41:35.368 --> 41:38.235
I'll get it.

41:48.590 --> 41:52.879
Hello? Oh, yes,
just a minute. Angelo.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.230
Hello?

42:07.233 --> 42:09.770
Al, this is ray.
I'm down at the courthouse.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.979
Yeah. Well, they hit him
with 11 counts murder,

42:13.990 --> 42:15.981
one assault. That's right.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.744
Naomi, smile for your daddy.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.796
Uh, the preliminary's
this afternoon.

42:35.804 --> 42:38.511
On top of that, the d.A. Says
they're gonna hold him over

42:38.515 --> 42:40.506
for the grand jury, no bail.

42:45.355 --> 42:48.438
Oh, they're bringing
him out now. Yeah.

42:48.441 --> 42:51.183
Hold on 2A minute.

42:55.657 --> 42:57.397
Ray, ray, what's going on?

43:26.604 --> 43:29.721
"10-year-old
Melissa Anne Montgomery

43:29.733 --> 43:31.314
"was the first victim

43:31.317 --> 43:34.525
"believed to have been
murdered in Cliffside park.

43:34.529 --> 43:37.396
“Her body thrown
to the waters below

43:37.407 --> 43:40.570
"from the notorious widow's peak.

43:42.454 --> 43:44.240
“The peak,

43:44.247 --> 43:47.114
"a popular spot
with young people

43:47.125 --> 43:49.958
"is also the haunting ground

43:49.961 --> 43:53.453
"of the legendary lady in white.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.963
“Reported by city
and local youths

43:58.970 --> 44:02.007
to be a mysterious,
long-robed woman

44:02.015 --> 44:05.132
who roams the cliffs at night.”

44:05.143 --> 44:06.724
We've got a surprise for him.

44:06.728 --> 44:08.309
Ok.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.019
Is he awake?

44:10.023 --> 44:12.139
I'll see, come on in.
Let's go and see.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.015
Let's go.

44:14.778 --> 44:16.018
Frankie.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.237
- Look who's here.
- Hey.

44:20.492 --> 44:22.107
Hey, broken arrow.

44:27.957 --> 44:30.448
Hi, Phil. Hi, Tony.

44:31.461 --> 44:33.417
How you doin', Frankie?

44:36.299 --> 44:39.382
Phil, why you call Frankie
a "broken arrow"?

44:40.220 --> 44:41.801
Because, mama,

44:41.805 --> 44:44.797
whenever we go for target practice
with that warped bow of his,

44:44.808 --> 44:46.890
the arrow curves away
from the bull's eye,

44:46.893 --> 44:48.679
hits the side of the hill,
and breaks in 2.

44:50.313 --> 44:55.649
So, from now on,
no more broken arrow.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.519
That's from me and Tony. See?

45:02.158 --> 45:05.571
Thanks, Phil. Thank you, Tony.

45:05.578 --> 45:07.569
You're welcome, Frankie.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.998
At least he looks good.

45:16.005 --> 45:19.293
Whoa. Whoa. Geno, what're you
doing with all those papers?

45:19.300 --> 45:21.382
It's a gold mine.
If Frankie autographs them,

45:21.386 --> 45:23.251
I'll get 50 cents apiece.

45:24.305 --> 45:27.047
The kid's a regular
Howard Hughes.

45:27.058 --> 45:30.471
They charged Harold Williams
with murder this morning.

45:35.900 --> 45:39.017
- He's being held without bail.
- You're kidding me.

45:42.282 --> 45:43.692
The janitor.

45:45.493 --> 45:47.029
Ray Saunders just called.

45:47.036 --> 45:49.618
He said he was hiding in
the boiler room at the school.

45:50.290 --> 45:53.202
- Been there all night.
- That black son of a bitch.

45:53.835 --> 45:56.326
Unbelievable.
I was just there this morning

45:56.337 --> 45:57.952
to prep the furnace for Monday.

45:58.923 --> 46:02.882
Willie claimed he'd gotten drunk
and had fallen asleep, that's all.

46:05.180 --> 46:08.513
All these years of sendin'
my kids to that school,

46:08.516 --> 46:10.097
watching them like a hawk,

46:10.101 --> 46:12.183
knowing that maniac
was still out there.

46:12.187 --> 46:14.644
I thought they'd nail
some guy from the city.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.228
Willie says he didn't do it.

46:16.232 --> 46:18.473
Of course that's what he says.
What else is he gonna say?

46:19.319 --> 46:21.184
Why would he do it?

46:21.196 --> 46:23.858
He's got children of his own.

46:23.865 --> 46:26.106
Why do any of these bastards
who go after kids do it?

46:26.117 --> 46:27.402
They're sick!

46:28.286 --> 46:30.527
Oh! I'm gonna go close up.

46:42.217 --> 46:44.253
How's Frankie?

46:48.097 --> 46:49.712
The kid's amazing.

46:51.059 --> 46:52.595
He loved the bow.

46:56.064 --> 46:57.929
I almost lost him, Philly.

46:59.734 --> 47:04.319
He's gonna be all right.
He's tough. He's a fighter.

47:05.782 --> 47:08.023
He takes after you.

47:08.034 --> 47:10.241
You're like a brother
to me, you know that?

47:11.537 --> 47:13.277
What's "like a brother"?

47:13.957 --> 47:15.663
We grew up together.

47:16.376 --> 47:18.367
We slept in the same room.

47:19.545 --> 47:21.706
We fought like cats and dogs.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.790
Does that remind you

47:25.802 --> 47:28.259
of a couple of other kids
we just happen to know?

47:31.224 --> 47:33.806
You know, when we were kids,

47:33.810 --> 47:37.519
nothing frightened me more than
the thought of losing my parents.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.439
Then I watched it happen to you.

47:42.193 --> 47:44.058
Both of them within a year.

47:46.990 --> 47:49.231
If it hadn't been for
vour mother and father,

47:49.242 --> 47:51.233
I don't know
what I would've done.

47:52.453 --> 47:55.320
It took a lot of strength
to deal with a loss like that.

47:56.833 --> 48:00.542
It was tough.
A lot of mixed emotions.

48:02.922 --> 48:03.922
But...

48:09.304 --> 48:13.172
Eventually you grow up.
You grow out of it.

48:17.353 --> 48:19.685
I used to think fear was
something you grow out of,

48:19.689 --> 48:23.307
like being afraid of the dark.

48:24.444 --> 48:25.980
But now, with Marianna gone

48:29.157 --> 48:31.148
I'm more fearful than ever.

48:33.786 --> 48:36.198
You know, Philly, the thing
that scares me the most

48:36.205 --> 48:38.787
is the thought
of losing one of my kids.

48:49.761 --> 48:52.002
In Mississippi, James Meredith,

48:52.013 --> 48:53.844
the first negro to enroll

48:53.848 --> 48:55.634
at the all-white
university of Mississippi,

48:55.641 --> 48:58.303
will begin classes on Monday.

48:58.311 --> 49:01.053
Meredith's presence on campus
earlier this month

49:01.064 --> 49:02.975
resulted in full-scale riots

49:02.982 --> 49:05.849
and the deployment
of 3,500 federal troops.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.456
Frank: Dear god,

49:23.086 --> 49:27.204
please bless mama and papa,
geno and dad

49:27.215 --> 49:29.297
and all the departed souls.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.716
Please bless Melissa.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.086
Amen.

50:14.595 --> 50:18.634
J did you ever see
a dream walking? J

50:19.809 --> 50:22.221
j; Well, I did! J

50:23.521 --> 50:28.106
j; Did you ever hear a dream j

50:28.109 --> 50:30.020
j talking? J;

50:30.027 --> 50:31.813
j; Well, I did! J

50:49.839 --> 50:51.045
J idd. J

50:59.307 --> 51:00.922
J idd. J

52:55.715 --> 52:58.548
“The eyes of the lord
are toward the righteous

52:58.551 --> 53:00.883
and his ears toward their cry.”

53:01.721 --> 53:04.303
Praise be to the lord.

53:04.307 --> 53:05.307
Amen.

53:08.686 --> 53:13.180
This morning, we have reason
to give special thanks.

53:13.190 --> 53:16.978
Frankie scarlatti is well
and is still with us.

53:17.820 --> 53:21.358
Our merciful savior has blessed
us with his presence.

53:22.366 --> 53:25.824
But what of the other children
who are no longer with us?

53:26.537 --> 53:28.528
What has become of them?

53:29.957 --> 53:33.745
They have found the eternal peace
which we all yearn for.

53:35.129 --> 53:37.290
They are forever in one

53:38.257 --> 53:39.997
with the almighty father

53:40.384 --> 53:41.999
in heaven.

53:43.387 --> 53:46.925
“For the eyes of the lord
are toward the righteous

53:46.932 --> 53:49.799
and his ears toward their cry.”

53:53.439 --> 53:55.179
I don't believe that.

53:59.862 --> 54:01.227
Agnes, please.

54:02.823 --> 54:04.359
It's Mrs. cilak.

54:08.621 --> 54:10.953
Why did our Richie have to die?

54:14.168 --> 54:15.874
Why wasn't he spared?

54:22.551 --> 54:24.758
Your boy's no better than mine.

54:30.851 --> 54:33.809
That murderer of hers
that killed him.

54:34.814 --> 54:36.930
Now he's gonna die, too.

54:41.404 --> 54:42.940
I spit on you.

54:44.156 --> 54:46.613
I spit on your
murdering husband.

56:28.594 --> 56:31.631
I apologize for what happened
back there, Matty.

58:18.078 --> 58:21.570
Weeks went by
and the days grew shorter.

58:22.583 --> 58:23.743
That year,

58:23.751 --> 58:27.209
time had a way of dragging on
forever in willowpoint falls.

58:28.756 --> 58:31.418
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho!

58:31.425 --> 58:33.916
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho!

58:34.094 --> 58:36.380
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho!

58:39.016 --> 58:40.881
At show and tell,
wise guy Donald

58:40.893 --> 58:42.508
introduced miss la della
to the limbo.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.510
Now, do you know
where the Caribbean is?

58:44.521 --> 58:46.102
San Juan?

58:46.106 --> 58:48.267
I told you, you have to
keep the pole up.

58:48.275 --> 58:51.187
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

58:51.195 --> 58:53.902
No, no, that won't do.

58:53.906 --> 58:56.818
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

58:56.825 --> 58:58.907
Up. No, you don't understand.

58:58.911 --> 59:00.242
Up. There.

59:01.288 --> 59:03.449
Christmas was coming

59:03.457 --> 59:05.618
and all the preparations
had begun.

59:08.796 --> 59:12.789
Mama baked Christmas cookies
for the decorating ceremonies.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.540
Hey, mama, what's that?

59:14.551 --> 59:15.586
Hey!

59:17.805 --> 59:20.137
Phil brought the tree,
just as he had every year.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.676
Will it fit? =yeah.

59:22.101 --> 59:23.466
Mamal

59:23.769 --> 59:25.134
that's it.

59:27.773 --> 59:29.604
Dad and geno hung lights.

59:29.608 --> 59:31.098
Tony was there, too.

59:31.110 --> 59:32.975
Here, have a snowball, son.

59:32.987 --> 59:34.318
And papa?

59:34.321 --> 59:37.438
Well, papa lent a hand
wherever needed.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.032
Ma, leave him alone.

59:51.839 --> 59:53.579
You rotten kid.

59:53.590 --> 59:55.672
As for me, I'd grown up

59:55.676 --> 59:58.509
just a little bit more
than I was supposed to, I think.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:02.596
Responsibility had become
my constant companion.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:06.638
And I was no longer afraid of
things that I could not see.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:23.484
I something very strange
and mystic happened to me j;

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:29.578
j something realistic
and as weird as can be j

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.293
I something that
ti feared somehow j

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:37.040
j' is now endeared to me j

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:40.885
; What a funny feeling,
odd and yet so true j

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:46.974
ji did a thing like this
ever happen to you? J;

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:54.523
j did you ever see
a dream walking? J

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:56.517
j; Well, I did! J

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:01.488
I did you ever hear
a dream talking? J

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.241
j; Well, I did! J

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:09.827
I did you ever have
a dream thrill you j

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.791
> with "will you be mine?" J

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:16.704
j oh, it's so grand j

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:20.549
j and it's too, too divine j

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:24.170
j did you ever see
a dream dancing? J

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.799
j; Well, I did! J

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:31.598
ji did you ever see
a dream romancing? J;

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.972
j; Well, I did! J

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:39.477
I did you ever see heaven
right in your arms j

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:42.776
j saying, "I love you, I do” j

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:45.616
> well, the dream that was walkin'
and the dream j

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.359
help me find her.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.828
J; Heaven in my arms was you j

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:55.014
Everybody's got to have
a place to be alone.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.235
I had my thinking tree.

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:09.783
It helped me think about things
and figure stuff out.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.682
Frankie?

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.274
Hi, Mr. lowry.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.940
- Hi. What're you doin' up there?
- 0oh, just thinkin'.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:47.320
Ah!

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:52.026
You know, I, uh, I dropped off
that package you've been waiting for.

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:53.618
You did? Uh-huh.

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:56.864
- All the way from Lincoln, Nebraska. Right!
- Lincoln, Nebraska!

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:04.379
Wipe your feet.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.758
It's in your bedroom.

01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:57.137
Look, al, all I'm saying is

01:04:57.144 --> 01:05:00.978
unless Frankie can verify that it
wasn't Williams that attacked him...

01:05:01.148 --> 01:05:04.185
Come on, ray. You've talked to Frankie.
He told you it was too dark to tell.

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:06.433
They're gonna put Harold
Williams away. I guarantee it.

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:09.107
- Where's their proof?
- He was in the building, al.

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.729
What the hell was he doing there
in the middle of the night?

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:12.322
He got drunk and passed out.

01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:15.033
His goddamn prints
were all over that cloakroom.

01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:16.652
And all over
the rest of the school.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.278
He works there
for Christ's sake.

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:19.905
He's the janitor.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.497
I'm tellin' you,
that doesn't matter.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.082
This case has been
making monkeys

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:24.792
out of all of us
for the past 10 years.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:27.003
Harold Williams
is a perfect scapegoat:

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:28.497
He's black.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:42.010
There's something else, al.

01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:44.058
That little Montgomery girl.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.022
10 years ago,

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.895
we found blood
in that cloakroom.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.949
It matched her type.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.318
I know that she
was killed there.

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:01.955
Hey, what's goin' on?

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:04.624
Phil!

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.334
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, partner.

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:08.124
There was a little girl.
I saw her.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.871
She was killed in the cloakroom.

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.714
Sheriff Saunders knows it.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:14.050
Then I heard something
fall into the furnace grate.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:16.716
So I went back and found
some stuff down there.

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:18.509
Stuff? What kind of stuff?

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:20.098
It was kid's stuff.

01:06:20.102 --> 01:06:22.013
Stuff that had
fallen down in there.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.635
It was all kid's stuff.

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.181
Except for the ring.

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:30.392
What?

01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:32.690
It was his ring.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.860
Maybe that's what
he came back to get.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:38.859
What are you mumbling about?

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.111
They were putting in
the new furnace.

01:06:41.123 --> 01:06:43.580
He knew they might find it.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:44.914
What?

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:47.663
Frankie?

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:50.162
Dad, I gotta talk to you.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.879
Geno: Hey!

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:55.000
Mama's on the warpath again.
It's time to eat.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.842
All right, tell her
we'll be right there.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:59.179
Frankie, go downstairs and help
your grandma set the table.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.138
- But, dad.
- Go ahead.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:57.653
Frankie, pass the ricotta.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:00.323
Thank you.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.996
Somebody's been
into my trunk again.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.078
It wasn't me. =-it wasn't me.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:16.210
Well, there's nothing
in there that would be

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:18.375
of any interest
to either one of you.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:20.877
So stay out. Capisce?

01:08:20.889 --> 01:08:22.970
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:27.134
Where's pa?

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:31.013
Um, he's drowning himself
because I hide his cigarettes.

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:38.979
I hope you take off
vour new wristwatch

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.776
before you drown yourself.

01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:43.612
Son of a bitch.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.569
That's it!

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:50.999
- Come out and eat!
- Oh, shut up.

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:55.999
Are you all right?

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:58.707
You jerk.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.386
Mama:
Did you find your cigarettes?

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.221
I put them in the drain.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.997
Mad miss Amanda Harper
was the town recluse.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:32.957
She used to give the kids
piano lessons,

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.790
but that was way before my time.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:38.379
Before she went crazy and tried to
burn her house down

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:40.465
while she laid in bed,
laughing at the inferno

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:41.924
all around her.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.089
They put her away after that.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.258
But she eventually came home.

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:48.970
I, personally,
had never seen her

01:09:48.977 --> 01:09:51.309
but I often heard her playing the piano
when I passed her house.

01:09:51.313 --> 01:09:52.473
Donald: Hey, Frankie!

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.276
Come here.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.866
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, what's up, man?

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:09.663
Nothin'.

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:11.909
We're going to the cottage.
You wanna come?

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:17.210
No. I promised my dad
I'd be home before dark.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:20.125
Besides, I have to finish delivering
these greeting cards.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.091
What's the matter?
Afraid the lady in white will get you?

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.552
- No.
- Then what're you waiting for?

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:28.172
Hop on.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.446
That's it.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:55.949
That's where she lived
before she committed suicide.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.292
What do you mean,
"committed suicide"?

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.912
I'd kill myself, too, if I had to live
in a spooky joint like that.

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.336
Jeez.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.653
Donald.

01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:32.152
Where the hell are you?

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.869
Donald: Hey, guys, look at this.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.994
Look at what I found.

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.711
What is it? =-it's the beast...

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:52.889
That destroyed London.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.677
You asshole.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:03.065
I got him at newberry's.
Say hello, Sam.

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.783
Sam!

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:15.953
Sam, come back here.
Come back, Sam.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:29.000
Shit. Where'd he go?

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:38.893
There he is.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.608
Sam!

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.986
Grab him! Get him, quick!

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.660
Melissa: Help me find her.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:31.957
Ok, now start comin' down
real slow.

01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:34.008
I'm not touching that thing.

01:14:34.012 --> 01:14:35.752
Would you just do what I tell...

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:42.137
What are you
waiting for, Donald?

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.851
He's gonna get away.

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:54.604
Holy shit!

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:58.653
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:07.454
Guys?

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.161
Guys?

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:46.073
I want to bite your neck.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.291
What are you doing here?

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:56.549
Dad told me to come find you.
Now call a doctor, quick.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.385
- What for?
- To save my unborn child.

01:15:59.389 --> 01:16:02.222
Guess you won't be doing it
under the covers for a while.

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:04.386
Oh, shit,
I thought you were asleep.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:07.677
Come on, get up. Be serious.

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:09.225
I saw her.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.642
Who?

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:12.106
The lady in white.

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:13.691
What?

01:16:13.695 --> 01:16:15.526
Melissa's mother
is the lady in white!

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:19.022
- Who's Melissa?
- Melissa Montgomery!

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.694
10 years ago, she was killed
in the cloakroom.

01:16:20.702 --> 01:16:22.283
I saw it happen.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:23.947
Are you gonna tell dad
I do it under the covers?

01:16:23.955 --> 01:16:26.116
If you do I'll tell him
vou went into his trunk.

01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:28.740
I have proof. =listen to me!

01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:37.336
Mom used to say

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:39.550
sometimes when someone
dies violent

01:16:39.554 --> 01:16:41.419
they can't rest in peace.

01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:44.343
I heard something fall
into the furnace grate.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:47.592
That's what the person who
tried to kill me came looking for.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.059
Looking for what?

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.224
I thought it was the barrette.

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:52.768
But it was this.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.310
My god.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:01.814
I must have lost it.

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:05.447
Lost what?

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:08.161
The ring.

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.452
That's what the killer
came looking for.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.246
It was in the grate.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:15.745
What kind of ring?

01:17:15.757 --> 01:17:17.338
It was a graduating ring,

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:18.751
like the one chicky
got last summer,

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.170
but very old.

01:17:22.472 --> 01:17:24.053
Well, come on, toad.

01:17:24.057 --> 01:17:26.218
We better get back
before dad lynches us both.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:28.932
But, geno, I've got to find it.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:30.517
It's the only thing that'll...

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:32.887
Come on, I'm tired. Let's go.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.477
Hey, you know what?
I heard the weatherman say

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:40.444
it's going to show
in toben county.

01:17:40.448 --> 01:17:42.404
We might get lucky.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.069
Yeah. Lucky.

01:20:13.184 --> 01:20:14.344
Charlie!

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.186
It's ok, papa, it's geno.

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:23.308
I thought grandma
caught me smoking.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.731
I won't tell if you won't. Deal?

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:27.854
Ok. Let's go.

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:37.204
Geno?

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:56.966
Don't scare her.

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:02.722
I'm trying my best.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:07.856
What does she want?

01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:11.530
She wants her mother.

01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:15.660
You got her number?
Let's call her.

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:20.285
I already told you.

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:22.575
Her mother is the lady in white.

01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:11.207
She's with him.

01:22:17.725 --> 01:22:19.932
Where are you going?

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.347
It's 10:00.
I've gotta follow her.

01:22:22.355 --> 01:22:24.095
That's when she was killed.

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:26.518
I heard the bells ringing
when I was in the cloakroom.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:28.607
That's where he's taking her.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.864
I'm not staying here alone.

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:42.363
Geno'® Frankie!

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:47.295
Wait!

01:22:56.097 --> 01:22:59.214
That's it.
That's the cloakroom window.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.222
Let's go home.

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.023
No.

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:55.060
Don't you see?

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:57.279
He's taking her to the cliffs.

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:05.947
Toad, wait!

01:25:10.356 --> 01:25:11.846
Mommy?

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:13.851
Mommy?

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:17.067
Mommy?

01:25:17.238 --> 01:25:19.980
Mommy! Mommy!

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.447
Mommy! Mommy!

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:23.941
She's alive!

01:25:23.953 --> 01:25:25.864
Mommy!

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.031
Mommy!

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:30.873
Mommy! Mommy!

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.491
No!

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:41.917
Anne: Melissal

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.017
Melissa, where are you?

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.104
Melissal

01:25:58.946 --> 01:26:00.402
melissal

01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:39.400
Come here, child.

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:42.102
Frankie, you ok?

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:20.642
How you feel? =horrible.

01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:22.730
What time is it?

01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:28.399
33 o'clock. =3:307?

01:27:29.203 --> 01:27:30.693
That's what I said.
What's the matter?

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:32.236
You no understand english?

01:27:33.374 --> 01:27:35.330
Why didn't you
wake me up for school?

01:27:35.334 --> 01:27:36.915
Why? I'll tell you why.

01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:38.534
You're so sick
vou don't remember.

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:41.082
You shook all over this morning.
=I did?

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:42.796
I think maybe vou got pneumonia.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.461
Oh, god forbid.

01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:47.005
Because all night
the window was open.

01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:49.879
Here.

01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:57.678
- Where's Frankie?
- At school. Where do you think?

01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:02.357
Phil, you want more café?

01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:04.477
Basta, mama. I've had enough.

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:06.274
I promised your brother
I'd pick him up,

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.942
take him out for some
target practice.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.566
I want to come. You?

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:12.818
Are you crazy?
You don't go no place.

01:28:13.872 --> 01:28:15.282
Where's dad?

01:28:18.252 --> 01:28:20.334
So don't make me
lose my temperature.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:24.121
It's temper, mama.
I've got a temperature.

01:28:24.133 --> 01:28:26.590
And me, too.
So don't make me mad.

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.174
Yeah.

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:30.669
- Arrivederci, mama.
- Arrivederci, Phil.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:32.967
Bye-bye.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:43.766
Too much talk. No work.

01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:46.234
Come on, geno.
We try the other end.

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:48.854
No, mama. =come on.

01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:49.866
Oh.

01:28:53.162 --> 01:28:54.197
Ow!

01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:59.907
Thanks, Johnny.

01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:01.499
- Nick, Nick!
- What's up?

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:03.585
They're lettin' him go.
Grand jury refused to indict.

01:29:03.589 --> 01:29:05.170
Insufficient evidence.

01:29:05.174 --> 01:29:06.914
Had to be.
The d.A.'S mad as hell.

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:13.341
All right. Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:24.185
Where's my wife? Hey!

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:28.776
Where's my Matty? Where is she?

01:29:28.781 --> 01:29:30.737
How do you feel, Mr. Williams?

01:29:30.741 --> 01:29:32.322
I feel fine, just fine.

01:29:32.326 --> 01:29:33.907
What are you gonna do now?

01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:35.492
These men are gonna
take me back to jail.

01:29:35.496 --> 01:29:37.908
I'm gonna get my things,
and go home to my family.

01:29:37.915 --> 01:29:40.247
Ok. Thank you, Mr. Williams.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.241
This is Jim Elliott,
w.G.A.C., reporting live

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:44.413
at the Gabriel county courthouse

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:46.833
where Harold Williams,
the accused suspect

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.796
involved in
the Cliffside child murders,

01:29:48.801 --> 01:29:50.757
has just been released
by the grand jury

01:29:50.761 --> 01:29:53.093
on grounds
of insufficient evidence.

01:29:56.809 --> 01:29:58.925
Stay in jail where you belong!

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:04.396
Where are you going, Agnes?

01:30:08.946 --> 01:30:10.686
I want to apologize.

01:30:18.205 --> 01:30:21.288
- I'll be home waiting for you.
- I'll be coming home.

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.920
Mr. Williams.

01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:44.099
Hello, Ms. cilak.

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:48.728
I just wanted to say...

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:51.310
I'm sorry...

01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:55.273
For all the trouble
vou've been through.

01:30:57.870 --> 01:31:00.657
Thank you.

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:02.746
That means a lot
coming from you.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:05.540
You're kind.

01:31:06.712 --> 01:31:07.952
Very kind.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:11.671
That's for my Richie.

01:31:11.675 --> 01:31:14.212
Oh, my god!

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:15.379
Oh, no!

01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:17.127
He's been shot!

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:20.923
Richie.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:42.702
Al: Matty?

01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:45.455
Matty?

01:31:45.459 --> 01:31:46.869
God, you're hurt. Ray!

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:48.951
How bad? How bad?

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:53.631
Ok, can you walk? Alright, nice
and easy. Let's take you to the doctor.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:55.298
She's in shock. Easy.

01:31:55.302 --> 01:31:57.588
Give us some room,
will you please? Please?

01:31:57.596 --> 01:31:59.882
It appears Harold Williams
has been shot and killed.

01:32:15.948 --> 01:32:17.688
“A.r.s.”

01:32:20.661 --> 01:32:23.027
“Angelo Rudolfo scarlatti.”

01:32:28.794 --> 01:32:30.409
“M.p.t.”

01:32:41.598 --> 01:32:43.463
“Michael

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:47.134
Philip terragrossa."

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.770
Phil.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:01.815
Frank: Wow!

01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:06.236
I'll never be that good.

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:08.739
Nah. It just takes a little
practice, that's all.

01:33:11.712 --> 01:33:13.543
You have to train your
mind not to think

01:33:13.547 --> 01:33:16.004
about anything else
except your target.

01:33:18.844 --> 01:33:20.425
It's gettin' late.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:27.011
Mama's probably
already made dinner.

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:30.222
I thought you and I
were gonna talk.

01:33:30.856 --> 01:33:32.312
I'm tired.

01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:35.269
Ok. We'll talk on the way home.

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:38.147
But what do you say
we have one more shot

01:33:38.155 --> 01:33:39.816
at that bullseye before we go?

01:33:40.407 --> 01:33:42.614
All right. =-good.

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:49.200
Ok. Get ready.

01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:55.001
I want you to keep your eye
on the bullseye

01:33:55.005 --> 01:33:56.666
and your left arm straight.

01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:58.792
That's it.

01:34:04.264 --> 01:34:06.380
Keep your eye on the target.

01:34:11.605 --> 01:34:12.845
Pull back.

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.061
Hold your breath.

01:34:24.785 --> 01:34:25.900
Release.

01:34:35.378 --> 01:34:37.460
Yeah. Not bad.

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:39.496
Not bad at all.

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:44.668
We're gonna make a marksman
out of you yet, broken arrow.

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:47.591
Well, let's pack up.

01:34:47.766 --> 01:34:49.552
You take these things.
I'll get the target.

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.266
Ok.

01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:27.427
J did you ever see
a dream walking? J

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:30.839
j well, I did!

01:35:30.851 --> 01:35:32.432
Ok, partner. Hand me those keys.

01:35:32.435 --> 01:35:34.391
I'll take you home
and get you some chow.

01:36:07.137 --> 01:36:09.924
Hey, Frankie, what's the matter?

01:36:13.476 --> 01:36:15.717
Come on. Open the door.

01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:20.605
Please.

01:36:24.446 --> 01:36:25.811
Frankie?

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:44.580
Open the door!

01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:50.176
Open the goddamn door!

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:19.247
Frankie?

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:34.007
Frankie!

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:03.416
Now, please, please.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:06.461
I'm not gonna hurt you. See?

01:38:12.846 --> 01:38:15.713
Now, you got to
listen to me, broken arrow.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:20.592
That night in the cloakroom,

01:38:22.647 --> 01:38:24.603
I didn't know it was you.

01:38:29.571 --> 01:38:31.653
I mean, I...

01:38:31.656 --> 01:38:33.692
I couldn't see you
behind the mask.

01:38:38.747 --> 01:38:42.535
I mean, if I'd...
If I'd known it was you

01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:44.328
I never would have...

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:48.336
Frankie, don't.

01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:49.420
Don't!

01:39:21.414 --> 01:39:22.904
Geno: Dad!

01:40:22.392 --> 01:40:25.384
Just tell me where it is, Frankie,
and I won't hurt you.

01:40:25.395 --> 01:40:27.511
I don't want to hurt you.

01:40:27.522 --> 01:40:29.763
I love you.
You're a beautiful boy.

01:40:29.774 --> 01:40:32.607
Please, give me the ring,
and I won't say anything about it.

01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:34.441
Nobody has to hear
anything about it.

01:40:34.446 --> 01:40:36.858
Your dad doesn't
even have to know.

01:40:37.657 --> 01:40:39.397
Oh, god.

01:40:39.409 --> 01:40:41.946
I could never face him
if he knew.

01:40:43.538 --> 01:40:44.869
Where is it?

01:40:45.874 --> 01:40:47.535
Give me the ring!

01:41:38.384 --> 01:41:40.215
Do you like my playing?

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:48.300
I could teach you.
I've taught many children.

01:41:52.899 --> 01:41:54.480
I taught her how.

01:42:07.413 --> 01:42:08.949
And her mother.

01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:12.949
How beautiful she was.

01:42:12.961 --> 01:42:15.247
And how she loved
her little girl.

01:42:16.798 --> 01:42:19.380
She lived and died for her.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:24.760
I wanted to die, too.

01:42:24.764 --> 01:42:26.971
But they wouldn't let me.

01:42:26.975 --> 01:42:30.888
What is the good of living
when all that you love is gone?

01:42:39.112 --> 01:42:42.104
Even in death,
she couldn't rest.

01:42:43.116 --> 01:42:44.526
I know.

01:42:46.202 --> 01:42:49.365
I see her roaming
the cliffs at night

01:42:49.372 --> 01:42:51.579
searching for her little girl.

01:42:52.875 --> 01:42:54.615
Calling out her name.

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:58.077
Melissa.

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:09.088
All these years

01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:12.971
how well I've kept her
for you, Anne.

01:43:14.397 --> 01:43:15.637
Her room.

01:43:17.692 --> 01:43:19.432
All her little things.

01:43:23.906 --> 01:43:27.740
I've kept them all for you,

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.532
my beloved sister.

01:44:01.277 --> 01:44:04.189
Now, now, child.

01:44:08.409 --> 01:44:10.821
I've killed him.

01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:15.613
See?

01:48:50.107 --> 01:48:51.563
Mommy.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:57.983
Thank you.

01:49:48.833 --> 01:49:50.118
Frankie!

01:49:52.461 --> 01:49:54.747
Dad. Ow!

01:50:09.979 --> 01:50:11.765
Dad!

01:50:13.566 --> 01:50:14.806
Dad!

01:50:32.710 --> 01:50:34.246
I love you, dad.

01:50:49.268 --> 01:50:50.804
No.

01:50:50.811 --> 01:50:52.142
It's ok.

01:51:09.914 --> 01:51:11.324
Take it.

01:51:14.668 --> 01:51:16.124
Take it!

01:51:43.823 --> 01:51:44.938
No.

01:51:46.408 --> 01:51:48.399
Philly, no!
