And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

02:43.830 --> 02:45.698
if it weren't for you meddling kids.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.767
Hey, I might have caught ya.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.938
Ah, you're right, I'm pretty
bad at my job.

02:52.004 --> 02:54.040
Thanks, meddling kids.
I'll take it from here.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.476
Man, oh, man.

02:57.543 --> 02:59.045
Like, I don't know about you guys,

02:59.111 --> 03:02.081
but I sure wouldn't mind going
someplace fun and sunny.

03:02.148 --> 03:05.251
How long have we been in this
stuffy old museum anyhow,

03:05.317 --> 03:06.385
two weeks?

03:06.452 --> 03:07.519
Three weeks?

03:07.586 --> 03:09.521
It's been two days.

03:09.588 --> 03:11.523
Huh, seemed longer.

03:11.590 --> 03:12.759
What do you say, guys?

03:12.825 --> 03:15.728
Let's go somewhere fun and unwind.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.797
I can't think of any place more fun

03:17.864 --> 03:19.732
than right here at the Museum
of Archeology.

03:19.799 --> 03:24.971
I, for one, found the display
on Aztec agriculture amazing.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.842
Velma, that's good.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.344
"Maize" is what the Aztecs called corn.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.549
Yeah, it was the "corn" er
stone of Aztec agriculture.

03:37.616 --> 03:41.688
It's lucky we're here, 'cause
that joke belongs in a museum.

03:41.754 --> 03:44.256
I'm with Shaggy.
Let's go somewhere fun.

03:44.323 --> 03:46.425
If you kids are looking for
someplace fun to go,

03:46.492 --> 03:49.595
the annual Blowout Beach Bingo
Bash just started.

03:49.662 --> 03:54.366
It's three fun-filled days of
singing, dancing, games and food.

03:54.433 --> 03:55.968
- Food!
- Food!

03:56.035 --> 03:57.303
Sure.

03:57.369 --> 03:59.605
They end the whole thing
with a giant beach barbecue

03:59.672 --> 04:04.310
where they crown the two most high-
spirited partiers Captains of the Bash.

04:04.376 --> 04:05.812
Yeah, let's all go.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.114
Sure, I'd be up for...

04:08.180 --> 04:11.117
Wait a second, you almost got me.

04:11.183 --> 04:13.853
I should not be in this line of work.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.156
Well, gang, looks like we're off

04:17.223 --> 04:18.858
to the Blowout Beach Bingo Bash.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.827
Yay!

04:34.673 --> 04:36.408
Could we turn the music down?

04:36.475 --> 04:39.178
I'm trying to read the
guidebook to Blowout Beach.

04:40.212 --> 04:41.981
Who needs a guidebook for a beach?

04:42.048 --> 04:44.751
There's sand and water and, uh...

04:44.817 --> 04:46.352
And that's it.

04:46.418 --> 04:47.553
Not so,

04:47.619 --> 04:48.859
there's the historic boardwalk,

04:48.888 --> 04:50.222
a thriving downtown music scene

04:50.289 --> 04:52.291
and a newly built pier amusement area.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.126
There's actually quite a bit to do.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.661
I'm going to draw up a schedule

04:55.728 --> 04:57.930
to optimize our fun once we get there.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.332
You can't optimize fun, Velma.

05:00.399 --> 05:01.633
You just have fun.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.835
I beg to differ.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.436
We've already missed half a day.

05:04.503 --> 05:06.405
If we're going to cram three days of fun

05:06.472 --> 05:09.909
into two and a half days, it's going
to require some tight scheduling.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.543
Good thinking, Velma.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.891
You know, schedules are one
of my favorite types of plans.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.482
Right up there with blueprints
and building instructions.

05:20.719 --> 05:22.321
Oh, man.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.457
Like, you guys are squares and
a couple of two-by-two bricks.

05:25.524 --> 05:28.327
- Hey!
- We're just as fun as you three.

05:32.264 --> 05:33.632
We are fun.

05:33.699 --> 05:36.535
Why, just last week I took us
all to that amusement park.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.411
That was a creepy, abandoned
amusement park.

05:45.477 --> 05:46.979
Filled with vampire clowns.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.215
What about the week before
that, when I was like,

05:49.281 --> 05:51.150
"Hey, guys, let's go to the zoo."

05:56.055 --> 06:00.359
Creepy, abandoned, and there was
a giant, zombie polar bear.

06:00.426 --> 06:03.662
Face it, you two, you just
don't like to have fun

06:03.729 --> 06:05.364
like other people like to have fun.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.733
You'd rather be solving a mystery.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.668
Like, it's not your fault
you guys are totally

06:09.735 --> 06:11.470
obsessed with creepy mysteries.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.973
We are not obsessed with mysteries.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.175
You named your van the Mystery Machine.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.777
You guys just can't resist
the spooky stuff.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.814
Just like how Scoob and I
can't resist a cheeseburger.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.749
- Or pizza.
- Or a hot dog.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.251
Or a triple decker sandwich.

06:25.317 --> 06:27.854
- With extra pickles.
- And mustard.

06:29.822 --> 06:32.058
Oh, man, I'm getting super hungry here.

06:32.124 --> 06:33.926
What was the point I was trying to make?

06:33.993 --> 06:35.161
Sandwiches taste good?

06:35.227 --> 06:37.563
No, that wasn't it...
Oh, yeah!

06:37.629 --> 06:39.131
You two are no fun.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.333
Not true, we have fun.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.401
We have lots of fun.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.071
Oh yeah? What's the last
fun thing you did?

06:45.137 --> 06:48.540
Oh! I read a fascinating book
on the history of nets.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.543
Like, I rest my case.

06:51.610 --> 06:54.346
We'll prove we can be just
as fun as you guys.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.283
- Yeah... We will?
- At the end of this weekend,

06:57.349 --> 07:00.519
when they name the captains of
the Blowout Beach Bingo Bash,

07:00.586 --> 07:03.155
it's going to be me
and Fred up on that stage.

07:03.222 --> 07:06.058
Yeah? I mean... Yeah!

07:06.125 --> 07:09.361

Uh-oh, I'm getting a very creepy and
abandoned feeling from this place.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.539
Everyone is probably down
at the boardwalk.

08:27.606 --> 08:29.308
According to my guidebook,
during the Bash

08:29.375 --> 08:31.143
the boardwalk is party central.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.015
Maybe there's another boardwalk.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.984
Where did everybody go?

08:38.049 --> 08:41.486
They must have sensed Fred and Velma's
party pooper vibes and left town.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.957
Ha-ha, very funny.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.558
Come on, let's check in to the hotel.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.660
Then we can catch up
with the party and prove

08:48.727 --> 08:50.029
we can have a good time.

08:59.471 --> 09:02.608
Pardon me, my fellow
carefree, fun-loving teens.

09:02.674 --> 09:05.344
Uh, we're looking for the Bingo Bash.

09:05.411 --> 09:08.247
The Bash is over, Daddy-O,
we're splitting.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.550
You cats should split, too,
if you know it's good for you.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.153
I wonder what spooked them.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.455
- Probably the pirates.
- "Pirates?"

09:16.522 --> 09:18.857
Calm down, fellas, I'm sure
he's just joking.

09:18.924 --> 09:20.026
Nope, no joke.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.327
How do you do, Rob Holdout.

09:21.393 --> 09:23.129
And this my lovely wife, Laura Holdout.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.131
As owners of this fine
establishment and all

09:25.197 --> 09:26.631
the attractions you see
on the boardwalk,

09:26.632 --> 09:28.967
allow me to welcome you
to the Holdout Inn.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.802
Ah, thank you.

09:30.869 --> 09:34.206
Sorry, but did you say those teens
were scared off by pirates?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.275
Pirates ransacked the pier this morning.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.510
Chased everyone off. Cookies?

09:42.481 --> 09:44.816
My goodness, the entire bowl?

09:44.883 --> 09:46.585
We need two rooms, please.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.021
Oh, I'm sorry, but we've only
got one available room.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.824
You're in luck!
Another room just opened up.

09:52.891 --> 09:56.528
You know, it is so nice to see
young people undeterred

09:56.595 --> 09:59.198
by the threat
of ferocious ghost pirates.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.433
Excuse me?

10:01.500 --> 10:04.603
I'd like to take a second to
confer with my associate, please.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.207
Scooby-Doo, old pal, did she
just say what I think she said?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.342
"Ferocious ghost pirates?"

10:10.409 --> 10:12.711
That's what I thought.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.912
- Well.
- It's been great.

10:13.979 --> 10:15.347
Vacation over, boy, am I relaxed.

10:15.414 --> 10:18.484
- Back to the Mystery...
- Cut it out, guys.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.952
Ghost pirates, you say?
No, no, no, no.

10:21.019 --> 10:22.421
Control yourself, Velma.

10:22.488 --> 10:23.922
You are not here to investigate,

10:23.989 --> 10:26.625
you are here for one reason
and one reason alone.

10:26.692 --> 10:27.826
That's right.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.696
We're gonna be crowned
Captains of the Bash.

10:30.762 --> 10:32.531
Ah, well, isn't that nice?

10:32.598 --> 10:35.567
You know, our kids Chad and
Krissy were last year's captains.

10:35.634 --> 10:38.370
Great, maybe they could give us
some tips on maximizing our fun

10:38.437 --> 10:41.240
in the most efficient way to
party down in the group setting.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.076
Uh, maybe.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.713
The only thing is, there aren't going
to be any captains this year, hon.

10:47.779 --> 10:49.581
- What?
- Why not?

10:49.648 --> 10:52.984
The ghost pirates stole the hats
they used to crown the captains.

10:53.051 --> 10:54.653
Were the hats valuable?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.189
No, they're just regular
old pirate hats.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.525
But you can't have captains
without them.

10:59.591 --> 11:02.394
- It's tradition. Tradition.
- Tradition.

11:03.795 --> 11:06.765
So then maybe the pirates
stole them to stop the Bash.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.734
I thought you said no investigating.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.969
Well, this is different.

11:11.036 --> 11:12.321
We've to get those
pirate hats back if Fred

11:12.322 --> 11:13.671
and I are going to be
Captains of the Bash.

11:13.672 --> 11:17.543
Excuse you, we are
the Captains of the Bash.

11:17.609 --> 11:19.245
Krissy, Chad.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.413
These nice young teens
are just checking in.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.215
Would you like to show them
to their rooms?

11:23.282 --> 11:26.685
- As if.
- Yeah, as if, Mother.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.955
Okay, well, this young lady
had some questions about, uh,

11:30.021 --> 11:33.559
maximum and official group
settings and, uh...

11:33.625 --> 11:35.961
She wanted tips on being fun.

11:36.027 --> 11:37.763
She looks like she could use them.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.899
Nice ascot.

11:40.966 --> 11:44.670
Chadwick Martin Holdout, that
is no way to talk to a guest.

11:44.736 --> 11:46.104
Whatever, Pops.

11:46.172 --> 11:49.074
We're going to the Octo Rock
Lounge and you can't stop us.

11:49.141 --> 11:50.576
Later.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.579
What's "SD" stand for?

11:53.645 --> 11:54.846
Strange Dog?

11:58.650 --> 12:01.753
Those two were crowned the
most fun partiers at the Bash?

12:01.820 --> 12:05.324
Fred, Velma, you guys might
have a shot at this.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.058
You'll have to excuse them.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.594
They've had a pretty bad attitude

12:08.660 --> 12:10.462
since they were voted captains.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.764
Those dang hats really
went to their heads.

12:12.831 --> 12:14.933
Maybe it's not so bad that
the pirates stole them.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.503
Can you tell us a little bit
more about the ghost pirates?

12:17.569 --> 12:20.206
Sure, that's them.
Right over there.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.574
- Ghost pirates!
- Ghost pirates!

12:26.178 --> 12:28.314
Oh, it's just a painting.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.582
I recognize those two from my guidebook.

12:30.649 --> 12:32.818
That's the pirate queen
Bonnie Bingo Belle

12:32.884 --> 12:34.220
and Captain Brutimore Bash.

12:34.286 --> 12:35.921
The Bingo Bash is named after them.

12:35.987 --> 12:38.290
And behind them is the Salty Brick,

12:38.357 --> 12:41.327
the most feared ship
to ever sail the seas.

12:41.393 --> 12:44.029
They even have a lady tied to the front.

12:44.095 --> 12:47.098
That particular figurehead is
the Roman goddess Aurora.

12:47.165 --> 12:50.602
And that skull and crossbones is
what they call a "Jolly Roger".

12:50.669 --> 12:52.002
Say, would you kids like to hear about

12:52.003 --> 12:54.606
the very first Blowout Beach Bingo Bash?

12:54.673 --> 12:56.375
You see, it was way back
in pirate time...

12:56.442 --> 12:58.477
Oh, Rob, you are not going to

12:58.544 --> 13:00.512
bore our guests with a history lesson.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.014
Rob's sort of the town's
amateur historian.

13:03.081 --> 13:04.516
Well, now, they don't mind, do you?

13:04.583 --> 13:07.253
Well, we really should be partying.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.359
But I suppose we have time

13:08.420 --> 13:10.188
to squeeze in a little history.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.923
That's the spirit.

13:11.990 --> 13:14.360
Now, like I was saying, it was
way back in pirate times.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.528
The pirate queen, Bonnie Bingo Belle

13:16.595 --> 13:18.530
and her partner, Captain Brutimore Bash,

13:18.597 --> 13:20.999
were the two most famous pirates around.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.227
They had just plundered a ship belonging

13:23.228 --> 13:25.604
to the super wealthy
Duchess Ducheeseslob,

13:25.671 --> 13:28.073
and decided to hide out for
a while at Blowout Beach,

13:28.139 --> 13:30.842
which, at the time, was
a notorious safe haven

13:30.909 --> 13:34.413
for pirates, rapscallions,
scallywags, lowlifes,

13:34.480 --> 13:37.583
privateers, smugglers and just
all-around bad guys.

13:37.649 --> 13:39.551
Yes, sir, they owned this town.

13:39.618 --> 13:42.488
In fact, the smugglers even
built secret tunnels

13:42.554 --> 13:44.756
all over Blowout Beach
to smuggle their goods.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.693
Oh, now, Rob, they don't
need to know all that.

13:47.759 --> 13:49.395
Just get to the Bingo Bash part.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.629
Honey, I was just about to.

13:50.696 --> 13:52.364
No, you were talking too much.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.065
It's a story dear, the whole point

13:54.132 --> 13:55.333
- is talking.
- I know what a story is.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.502
Every time.

13:56.568 --> 13:57.836
Every time I start talking...

13:57.903 --> 13:59.571
Oh, it's not every time.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.106
- You start up...
- Two sentences?

14:01.172 --> 14:02.808
...with "Rob, you talk too much."

14:02.874 --> 14:04.943
Oh, is that supposed to be me?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.477
- Do you wanna tell the story?
- Is that what...

14:06.478 --> 14:08.046
- Fine.
- Hold on.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.414
Bingo Belle and Captain Bash
sailed into port,

14:09.415 --> 14:10.816
their ship full of treasure.

14:10.882 --> 14:13.151
Well, anyhow they were so happy with all

14:13.218 --> 14:15.653
their new riches that they threw a
giant party that lasted three days.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.690
It was the first
Blowout Beach Bingo Bash.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.859
Oh, you see, on the third day,

14:20.926 --> 14:23.061
a navy warship, the Gilded Cod,

14:23.128 --> 14:25.697
under the command of the dashing
Commodore Ducheeseslob...

14:25.764 --> 14:27.065
The duchess's nephew.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.771
Commodore Ducheeseslob sailed into
Blowout Beach and ambushed the pirates.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.973
They arrested Bingo Belle
and Captain Bash.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.675
But, as it turned out, it wasn't

14:36.742 --> 14:38.777
Bingo Belle and Captain Bash at all.

14:38.844 --> 14:42.280
It was just two teenagers Belle
and Bash had given their hats to

14:42.348 --> 14:44.249
in order to fool the Commodore.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.952
Those were the first teens
crowned Captains of the Bash.

14:47.018 --> 14:48.487
May I continue?

14:48.554 --> 14:51.156
As soon as the Commodore
realized his mistake,

14:51.222 --> 14:54.926
Belle and Bash, aboard the Salty
Brick, sailed into the harbor,

14:54.993 --> 14:58.364
opened fire on the beach
and sunk the Gilded Cod.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.265
What they didn't anticipate, however,

15:00.332 --> 15:01.799
was that waiting for them in the harbor

15:01.800 --> 15:03.602
were even more navy warships

15:03.669 --> 15:05.671
under the command
of Admiral Ducheeseslob.

15:05.737 --> 15:07.272
The duchess's uncle.

15:07.339 --> 15:08.940
The admiral confiscated the Salty Brick

15:09.007 --> 15:11.076
and arrested all the pirates aboard,

15:11.142 --> 15:12.911
except for Belle and Bash.

15:12.978 --> 15:17.282
In all the chaos, they
and the treasure disappeared.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.950
Never to be seen again.

15:20.285 --> 15:22.588
There they are, Officers, arrest them.

15:22.654 --> 15:24.823
Sheriff, what's this about?

15:24.890 --> 15:26.617
Mr. Monkfish is alleging
that you two are

15:26.618 --> 15:28.427
responsible for that
pirate attack earlier.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.261
A pretty cheap stunt,

15:30.328 --> 15:31.930
trying to chase away all my customers

15:31.997 --> 15:33.965
on the busiest weekend of the year.

15:34.032 --> 15:35.667
Hello, Dwight Monkfish.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.669
I own the pier at Blowout Beach.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.138
It's the big wooden thing
sticking out into the ocean.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.272
Perhaps, you've seen it?

15:41.339 --> 15:42.741
We're Mystery Incorporated.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.410
Oh, is that your band name?

15:44.476 --> 15:47.145
Well, when you get tired of this
rundown dump you should come by.

15:47.212 --> 15:50.482
We're always looking for fresh, young
musical acts down at the pier.

15:50.549 --> 15:51.650
You can work for tips.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.118
Now look here, Monkfish.

15:53.184 --> 15:54.386
Who do you think you are,

15:54.453 --> 15:56.488
coming in here accusing us of crimes?

15:56.555 --> 15:58.524
Calling our cozy inn a "dump".

15:58.590 --> 16:00.058
I call 'em like I sees 'em.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.594
Just look at this place,
loose bricks everywhere.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.130
You gotta press these things
together firmly.

16:05.196 --> 16:06.432
It's disgraceful.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.600
Hey! Sheriff,

16:08.667 --> 16:10.969
do you really think Rob
and I would steal the hats

16:11.036 --> 16:13.539
right off our own children's
darling little heads?

16:13.605 --> 16:15.737
Besides, you've been
trying to get us to sell

16:15.738 --> 16:17.776
our property to you
since you came to town,

16:17.843 --> 16:19.177
you pompous moustache twirler.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.079
Why, I'd rather see
the boardwalk destroyed

16:21.146 --> 16:22.180
than sell it you.

16:22.247 --> 16:23.549
Yeah, how do we know

16:23.615 --> 16:26.217
it wasn't you responsible
for that pirate attack?

16:26.284 --> 16:28.353
Oh, oh, that's rich.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.229
Me, sabotaging my own business the day

16:30.230 --> 16:32.323
before I open my brand-new
roller coaster.

16:32.390 --> 16:34.025
It's called the Blowout Blizzard.

16:34.092 --> 16:37.162
You'll love it, it goes
up, down, around, you name it.

16:37.228 --> 16:38.497
It's even got a loop.

16:38.564 --> 16:39.964
Mitzi, what are you standing around for?

16:39.965 --> 16:41.366
Give these kids some free passes

16:41.433 --> 16:43.134
for the grand opening tomorrow.

16:43.201 --> 16:45.837
Except for him, no dogs allowed.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.338
How rude.

16:47.405 --> 16:50.075
So you're not arresting them? Fine.

16:50.141 --> 16:51.543
But I'm watching you.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.210
Come on, Mitzi, what are you
standing around for?

16:53.211 --> 16:54.513
We've got things to do.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.782
- It was nice meeting you.
- Mitzi!

16:56.848 --> 16:58.650
Sorry to bother you, folks.

17:00.385 --> 17:04.155
Hmm, I'm gonna catch up
with the Sheriff for a second.

17:04.222 --> 17:07.858
Well, that vacation lasted
about two seconds.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.695
You know, Sheriff, my friends
and I are mystery solvers.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.330
Mystery solvers? I thought
you were in a band.

17:13.397 --> 17:15.000
No, we solve mysteries.

17:15.066 --> 17:17.233
If there is anything we can do
to help your investigation...

17:17.234 --> 17:18.970
"Investigation?"

17:19.037 --> 17:21.772
It was probably just some local
teens blowing off some steam.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.309
All they did was take a couple
of old hats and chase away

17:24.375 --> 17:27.244
some obnoxious out-of-towners
like yourselves.

17:27.311 --> 17:29.648
Frankly, this is usually
a nice sleepy beach town,

17:29.715 --> 17:33.051
so now with Monkfish trying to make
this a year-round vacation spot,

17:33.118 --> 17:36.221
well, my deputy and I wouldn't mind
if those pirates did put an end

17:36.287 --> 17:39.558
to the Bash and all the annoying
tourists, like yourselves,

17:39.625 --> 17:40.926
that it attracts.

17:46.097 --> 17:47.065
What did he say?

17:47.132 --> 17:49.735
Gang, it's time to investigate.

17:49.801 --> 17:51.402
Velma, you got any leads?

17:51.469 --> 17:52.671
I sure do.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.640
Daphne, you go investigate the pier.

17:54.706 --> 17:56.174
Talk to that Dwight Monkfish.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.576
See what you can find out.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.343
Shaggy and Scooby, according
to my guidebook

17:59.344 --> 18:02.213
Bingo Belle and Captain Bash's
ship, the Salty Brick,

18:02.280 --> 18:04.950
is still docked in the harbor
as a historical exhibit.

18:05.016 --> 18:06.284
Why don't you go check it out?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.419
Like, forget that.

18:08.486 --> 18:11.488
There's ghost pirates running around and
you want us to go check out their boat?

18:11.489 --> 18:14.993
You guys weren't actually scared
by those ghost stories, were you?

18:15.060 --> 18:16.161
Not scared.

18:16.227 --> 18:17.362
Terrified!

18:17.428 --> 18:18.530
That's too bad.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.965
According to my guidebook,

18:20.031 --> 18:22.233
the Salty Brick has an
excellent snack bar.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.835
- Snacks?
- Yup.

18:23.902 --> 18:27.105
It says here they've got nachos,
French fries, chicken wings,

18:27.172 --> 18:30.208
popcorn shrimp, and
deep-fried Scooby snacks.

18:30.275 --> 18:34.279
We'll catch you landlubbers
later, we've got a bus to catch!

18:37.248 --> 18:40.886
And on the starboard side,
you'll see more portholes.

18:40.952 --> 18:45.591
The term "porthole" applies whether
they are on the portside of the ship

18:45.657 --> 18:47.826
or the starboard side.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.629
There are 36 portholes on this ship,

18:50.696 --> 18:53.531
each one with its own unique story.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.768
How could they turn something
as scary as a pirate ship

18:56.835 --> 18:59.738
into something so boring?

18:59.805 --> 19:03.775
Please save your questions
for the end of the tour.

19:03.842 --> 19:06.845
Like, excuse me, Mr. Museum Guide dude.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.915
Like, do you think that
we can stop by the snack bar?

19:09.981 --> 19:14.185
Oh, no, we replaced that
with an exhibit on barrels.

19:14.252 --> 19:17.088
But don't worry,
we'll get to that later.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.423
No snacks?

19:18.489 --> 19:21.727
If you don't mind, we'd
like to abandon ship.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.963
Out of consideration for
all our other guests,

19:25.030 --> 19:27.132
- I can't lower the gangplank...
- What other guests?

19:27.198 --> 19:29.868
...for you to leave
until after the tour.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.337
Now, if there are no
further interruptions,

19:32.403 --> 19:36.107
we still have four more
hours on this tour.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.709
Four hours?

19:37.776 --> 19:40.679
I don't think my stomach's is
gonna make it that long, Scoob.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.113
Let's see if there's

19:42.180 --> 19:44.449
anything to eat in the ship's galley.

19:44.515 --> 19:48.787
There are 42 different and
fascinating uses for a porthole.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.255
Number one...

20:05.336 --> 20:07.238
So, this is the local
teen rock and roll club?

20:07.305 --> 20:10.408
It's quieter than I thought it would be.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.177
Nice.

20:12.243 --> 20:14.812
I guess everyone's nerves are still
recovering from the pirate attack.

20:14.813 --> 20:17.649
Well, maybe as the future
Captains of the Bash,

20:17.716 --> 20:19.685
it's up to us to get the party going.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.820
Ahoy, maties!

20:25.423 --> 20:27.225
No, no, no, no, no.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.694
We're not pirates.

20:28.760 --> 20:32.063
Just a couple of freewheeling
teenagers such as yourselves.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.803
Maybe tone down
the pirate speak, Captain.

20:37.869 --> 20:40.138
And let's try engaging a smaller group.

20:42.407 --> 20:46.978
Hey, fellas. Say, would you like to
hear a funny story about a trap?

20:47.045 --> 20:48.279
"Trap?"

20:48.346 --> 20:50.749
Actually it's about a
snare trap, to be specific.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.921
- Maybe later.
- Look over there.

20:55.987 --> 20:59.390
It's Chad and Krissy,
we should go say hi.

20:59.457 --> 21:03.394
Hey, Chad, Krissy,
fancy meeting you two here.

21:03.461 --> 21:07.465
- Do we know you?
- We met at your parents' inn.

21:07.532 --> 21:11.136
Less than an hour ago, you
wouldn't show us to our rooms.

21:12.738 --> 21:16.007
You made fun of his ascot
and insulted our dog.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.977
Oh yeah, Strange Dog.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.012
- Can we help you?
- Yeah, actually we were...

21:21.079 --> 21:23.514
Oh, no, when I said, "Can we help you?"

21:23.581 --> 21:25.150
I meant it more like, uh...

21:25.216 --> 21:28.053
- Go away.
- Yeah, that.

21:28.119 --> 21:30.355
- Look, chum...
- It's Chad.

21:31.156 --> 21:32.457
Ah, right.

21:32.523 --> 21:35.293
Listen, if we did something
to offend you, I'm sorry.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.527
But we were just wondering
if you could tell us anything

21:37.528 --> 21:39.564
about the pirate attack earlier.

21:39.630 --> 21:42.267
I understand the pirates took the
hats right off your darling...

21:45.070 --> 21:45.904
Um...

21:45.971 --> 21:47.638
I'm sorry, what's that?

21:47.705 --> 21:50.208
Shoo, fly, don't bother us.

21:51.676 --> 21:53.511
Come on, Fred, let's go.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.783
You know, you two are decidedly unjinky.

22:00.752 --> 22:01.987
"Jinky."

22:02.053 --> 22:03.388
What a couple of...

22:03.454 --> 22:05.924
Corn dogs, now I know
what you're thinking.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.226
You can get corn dogs
down at the boardwalk.

22:08.293 --> 22:12.630
But these aren't any old, normal,
run-of-the-mill boardwalk corn dogs, no.

22:12.697 --> 22:15.300
These are infused with, uh...

22:15.366 --> 22:19.805
Wasa, uh, wasalami,
wasatoosie, wasa-matter-you...

22:19.871 --> 22:21.639
Mitzi, what's that stuff called?

22:21.706 --> 22:23.975
- Wasabi, sir.
- Wasabi!

22:24.042 --> 22:26.477
How's that for a classic
gourmet experience?

22:26.544 --> 22:28.947
I want to transform this sleepy old town

22:29.014 --> 22:32.550
into "the" destination for the
young and well-to-do.

22:32.617 --> 22:35.787
And it begins
by bulldozing that ugly old

22:35.854 --> 22:37.355
beach and boardwalk down there

22:37.422 --> 22:40.125
and turning the whole thing into piers.

22:40.191 --> 22:42.693
You want to turn the whole
town into piers?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.520
You hear that inflection
in her voice, Mitzi?

22:44.562 --> 22:47.432
It is the sound of
resistance, of complacency,

22:47.498 --> 22:49.467
of a no-can-do attitude.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.568
Yes, sir.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.971
Piers, Ms. Blake, are the future.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.372
The ocean levels are rising up

22:54.439 --> 22:56.774
and piers will be there to meet them.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.343
My piers.

22:58.409 --> 23:00.745
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to a photoshoot

23:00.812 --> 23:02.313
for Modern Pier Owner magazine.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.315
They're putting me on the cover.

23:04.382 --> 23:07.318
Ms. Capaletto can answer any
further questions you may have.

23:07.385 --> 23:08.386
Piers!

23:08.453 --> 23:09.787
Wow, the cover.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.523
He must be well-respected
in the pier-owning community.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.894
Mr. Monkfish owns Modern
Pier Owner magazine.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.328
He's on every cover.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.998
Oh, I see.
Thanks Ms. Capaletto.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.633
"Mitzi." My friends call me Mitzi.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.870
Because it's my first name.

23:24.936 --> 23:27.873
Mitzi, did you witness the
pirate attack this morning?

23:27.939 --> 23:29.540
I did.

23:29.607 --> 23:31.977
They were just like Mr. Holdout
used to describe them.

23:32.043 --> 23:34.145
- Mr. Holdout?
- Where?

23:34.212 --> 23:37.282
No, Mr. Holdout used to
describe the pirates?

23:37.348 --> 23:40.751
Oh yes, he used to give
the tours of the Salty Brick

23:40.818 --> 23:42.620
when I was a kid.

23:42.687 --> 23:45.690
He had to stop after he hurt his
leg in that bumper car accident.

23:45.756 --> 23:47.158
Oh, what happened?

23:47.225 --> 23:50.495
Another bumper car just
hit him and drove off.

23:50.561 --> 23:54.132
Mr. Holdout used to love telling
us about the missing treasure.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.202
I still remember the poem he
used to recite.

23:57.268 --> 23:58.069
Poem?

23:58.136 --> 24:00.571
- Where?
- No, he'd recite a poem?

24:01.272 --> 24:02.407
Oh, yes.

24:02.473 --> 24:05.376
You see, they never did
find Belle or Bash.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.979
But the parrots they kept
aboard the Salty Brick used

24:08.046 --> 24:10.548
to repeat this poem about the treasure.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.649
Could I hear it?

24:11.716 --> 24:13.384
Let me see now.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.322
"If ye be looking to get rich quick

24:17.388 --> 24:20.425
"then climb aboard the Salty Brick.

24:20.491 --> 24:22.593
"Go on bow, tip our hats

24:22.660 --> 24:24.229
"respect great treasure

24:24.295 --> 24:28.066
"and at the dawn, shake
hands for good measure."

24:28.133 --> 24:30.068
Hmm, so this morning did

24:30.135 --> 24:32.470
the pirates mention
the missing treasure?

24:32.537 --> 24:33.538
No.

24:33.604 --> 24:35.941
They just stole the hats
off Chad and Krissy

24:36.007 --> 24:37.943
and then chased everyone off.

24:38.009 --> 24:39.810
They said the Bash was over.

24:39.877 --> 24:42.948
Do you know where Mr. Monkfish
was during all this?

24:43.014 --> 24:44.682
I know what you're thinking.

24:44.749 --> 24:45.951
It wasn't him.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.986
I know he comes off as brash,

24:48.053 --> 24:49.687
arrogant, a little short-tempered,

24:49.754 --> 24:53.091
gross, slimy, pure evil and
the lowest kind of scum,

24:53.158 --> 24:55.260
but he isn't all bad.

24:55.326 --> 24:59.030
I think in his own way he
really cares about this town

24:59.097 --> 25:00.198
and its people.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.167
What are you doing, makeup?

25:02.233 --> 25:04.970
I have very sensitive skin, you dolt!

25:05.036 --> 25:06.604
You wouldn't know anything about that.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.107
You have the coarse skin of
someone destined for failure.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.010
Like all the other losers
in this one-pier town.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.845
You're fired! In fact, you're all fired!

25:14.912 --> 25:17.648
Give me that, I'll do it myself.

25:17.715 --> 25:21.186
That's right, work it,
yup, you're an animal.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.654
I love business!

25:28.559 --> 25:30.569
How are we going to be named Captains of

25:30.570 --> 25:32.730
the Bash when the bash
is more of a bust?

25:32.797 --> 25:36.167
We just have to figure out a way to
get this party started up again.

25:36.234 --> 25:40.438
Now, what's something that regular
non-mystery solving teenagers enjoy?

25:42.540 --> 25:44.309
Ah! Hmm...

25:44.375 --> 25:46.144
May be the gang was right about us.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.113
Let's go catch up with them.

25:48.179 --> 25:51.983
Jinkies!

25:55.386 --> 25:57.955
Say, that's one crazy dance move.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.157
What's it called?

25:59.224 --> 26:00.858
Oh, no, I wasn't doing a dance.

26:00.925 --> 26:01.993
It's called the Jinky.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.494
What?

26:03.561 --> 26:05.462
These cool teens were
impressed by your new dance.

26:05.463 --> 26:07.165
Oh, that.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.468
Yes, it's a pretty popular
move where we come from.

26:10.535 --> 26:12.137
Oh, where's that?

26:12.203 --> 26:14.572
Uh... Cooltown?

26:14.639 --> 26:16.141
Upper Cooltown.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.742
Sounds cool.

26:17.808 --> 26:20.178
Say, do you think you could
show us how to do the Jinky?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.947
Oh, I, I guess.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.249
Gather around, everyone,

26:24.315 --> 26:26.317
there's a hip new dance you gotta see.

26:26.384 --> 26:29.287

28:07.852 --> 28:09.620
And so is your lame new dance.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.021
- Lamoid.
- Yeah.

28:11.088 --> 28:12.723
More like the Jerky.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.492
Hey, what's your problem?

28:14.559 --> 28:17.228
She said she was sorry,
we're just trying to have fun.

28:17.295 --> 28:20.097
It is so sad what passes
for fun these days.

28:20.165 --> 28:22.333
Come on, everybody,
let's ditch these weirdos

28:22.400 --> 28:23.768
and go someplace cool.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.673
Um, why are you all just standing there?

28:28.739 --> 28:30.708
Your Bash Captains are leaving.

28:30.775 --> 28:34.512
So leave, you two have been
major bummers for way too long.

28:34.579 --> 28:36.747
- Whatever, it's lame in here.
- Yeah.

28:36.814 --> 28:39.784
When you losers realize how
uncool this is,

28:39.850 --> 28:40.951
come find us.

28:41.018 --> 28:42.453
And we might forgive you.

28:44.255 --> 28:48.025
How did those two become last
year's Captains of the Bash?

28:48.092 --> 28:49.760
Who knows?

28:49.827 --> 28:51.362
Hit it, Tentacles.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.708
What kind of pirate ship
doesn't have a kitchen?

29:03.774 --> 29:07.245
Like, "arrr" you kidding me?

29:07.312 --> 29:10.080
- Everyone's a critic.
- It wasn't me.

29:12.217 --> 29:13.984
Like, we better find some food quickly.

29:14.051 --> 29:17.087
The sound of my stomach
growling is making me lose

29:17.154 --> 29:19.290
- my appetite.
- Me too.

29:22.793 --> 29:24.094
Arrr!

29:24.161 --> 29:27.998
On second thought, maybe
there's some food above deck.

29:28.065 --> 29:29.300
Like on land.

29:29.367 --> 29:31.236
Far, far away from here.

29:31.302 --> 29:33.338
Like, in a different country.

29:33.904 --> 29:35.240
Yikes!

29:35.306 --> 29:37.875
Looks like we've got a couple
of stowaways.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.344
Like, we were just leaving.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.312
- Right, Scoob?
- Leaving?

29:41.379 --> 29:42.713
I'm already gone.

29:49.487 --> 29:53.658
And that is all 42 uses for a porthole.

29:53.724 --> 29:57.728
Which brings us, of course, to
the cousin of the porthole,

29:57.795 --> 29:59.397
the gun port.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.000
Quick, Scoob, pull some
of those cannons over here

30:03.067 --> 30:04.802
and we'll barricade the door.

30:07.738 --> 30:09.206
No touching.

30:15.079 --> 30:16.614
- Scoob!
- Whoa!

30:16.681 --> 30:19.284
This tour is already in progress.

30:19.350 --> 30:24.221
If you'd like a tour, you'll have
to come back for our next tour.

30:27.492 --> 30:31.161
Another fascinating use for portholes.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.837
Welcome, ghost pirates, to another
episode of This Old Ship,

30:39.904 --> 30:41.839
the show that takes moldy old ships

30:41.906 --> 30:46.511
and transforms them into
stylish, modern sailing vessels.

30:47.578 --> 30:49.580
What be all this now?

30:49.647 --> 30:52.950
This old ship needs a total
interior design overhaul.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.919
Scoob, what are you thinkin'?

30:54.985 --> 30:56.654
Hmm...

30:56.721 --> 30:57.272
Open concept.

30:57.274 --> 30:58.924
You took the words
right out of my mouth!

30:58.989 --> 31:02.560
Try, if you will, to picture our vision.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.630
We start by adding a few more
portholes along this wall,

31:05.696 --> 31:07.665
give it a light, airy feel.

31:07.732 --> 31:11.336
Moving on, we were thinking we could
paint this wall over here a fun color.

31:11.402 --> 31:13.404
Yeah, really make it pop!

31:13.471 --> 31:15.582
And, of course, we
just want to lose this

31:15.583 --> 31:17.442
wall entirely and open up the space.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.076
What do you think?

31:19.143 --> 31:21.946
That would really improve the
flow to the bow of the ship.

31:22.012 --> 31:23.514
Exactamundo.

31:23.581 --> 31:25.916
So now that we're all on
the same page with the design,

31:25.983 --> 31:27.618
let's start demo!

31:27.685 --> 31:32.557
As the boat owner, I'll let you
take the very first swing, big guy.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.995
Thank you.
Like, run, Scoob!

32:17.034 --> 32:19.103
Fred? Velma?

32:19.169 --> 32:21.105
Hey, Daph!
Do the Jinky!

32:22.206 --> 32:23.273
The what?

32:23.340 --> 32:24.909
The Jinky!

32:27.011 --> 32:30.681
Daphne, I want you to meet
Brenda and Tommie.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.282
They're the jinkiest.

32:32.349 --> 32:34.284
Daphne rolls in our crew.

32:34.351 --> 32:36.053
Far out!

32:36.120 --> 32:39.356
Any friend of Vel and the
Fredman is su casa, you dig?

32:41.358 --> 32:43.528
"Crew?" "Fredman?"

32:43.594 --> 32:45.329
- Fun, right?
- Sure.

32:45.396 --> 32:46.897
I wanted to talk to you guys.

32:46.964 --> 32:49.534
I think I found some clues
down at the pier.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.868
Oh no, you don't!

32:50.935 --> 32:52.002
We're having fun.

32:52.069 --> 32:54.138
Yeah. Clues can wait.

32:54.204 --> 32:55.773
"Clues can wait"?

32:55.840 --> 32:56.707
Who are you?

32:56.774 --> 32:58.476
I'm Vel from Cooltown,

32:58.543 --> 33:02.547
and according to my calculations,
it's time to get funky!

33:03.748 --> 33:05.850
Have you guys found anything out here?

33:05.916 --> 33:08.052
Or have you just been
dancing this whole time?

33:08.118 --> 33:11.989
There'll be time to investigate after
we're crowned Captains of the Bash.

33:12.056 --> 33:14.525
No, there won't. Did you
forget they stole the...

33:14.592 --> 33:17.995
Daph, do you mind? You're being
a real party pooper right now.

33:18.062 --> 33:20.965
Yeah, you're being a total Fred.

33:21.031 --> 33:22.032
You're Fred!

33:28.205 --> 33:29.774
Like, we have major problems.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.075
Where's Fred and Velma?

33:31.141 --> 33:32.843
You mean Fredman and Vel?

33:32.910 --> 33:34.278
They're out on the dance floor.

33:34.344 --> 33:36.647
I think maybe we teased them
a little too hard.

33:36.714 --> 33:39.249
It's like all they care about
now is fun.

33:39.316 --> 33:42.252
Like, I don't blame 'em.
We could all use a little fun.

33:42.319 --> 33:45.289
You'll never guess who we
ran into at the Salty Brick.

33:45.355 --> 33:46.891
- The pirates!
- Yeah.

33:46.957 --> 33:49.093
- That's right.
- Good guess.

33:49.159 --> 33:50.394
No, behind you!

33:50.461 --> 33:51.996
The pirates!

33:53.163 --> 33:54.164
Zoinks!

34:09.313 --> 34:11.549
Arrr! Party's over.

34:40.844 --> 34:41.911
Arrr!

35:13.243 --> 35:14.545
Arrr!

35:39.604 --> 35:41.138
Where'd the pirates go?

35:41.205 --> 35:44.008
Who cares? As long as they're gone!

35:44.074 --> 35:45.810
Brenda and Tommie are gone, too!

35:54.785 --> 35:58.422
Well, maybe if Shaggy and Scooby hadn't
led the pirates right to the club...

35:58.488 --> 36:02.192
Like, no way, man!
We saw those pirates sail off.

36:02.259 --> 36:05.229
How could they have sailed the ship
away and shown up minutes later

36:05.295 --> 36:06.496
at the Octo Rock Lounge?

36:06.563 --> 36:08.565
Oh, now you start investigating?

36:08.633 --> 36:11.969
Maybe if you two hadn't been so caught
up in trying to prove you could be fun,

36:12.036 --> 36:13.671
we could have saved your friends.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.841
Well, if we'd been busy investigating,

36:16.907 --> 36:18.375
they wouldn't have been our friends!

36:22.847 --> 36:24.148
What's all the commotion?

36:24.214 --> 36:26.550
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Holdout.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.097
We're just upset about those pirates.

36:28.118 --> 36:30.655
Well, you're not gonna get
anywhere by squabbling.

36:30.721 --> 36:32.723
Teamwork, that's the key,
if you want to solve

36:32.790 --> 36:34.391
your little case of the missing hats.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.026
That's right.

36:36.093 --> 36:38.327
I'm afraid the case is bigger
than just missing hats now.

36:38.328 --> 36:40.665
It's expanded to two missing teens.

36:40.731 --> 36:42.833
And, like, one boat-napped boat!

36:42.900 --> 36:44.168
Two missing teens?

36:44.234 --> 36:46.737
- That's impossible.
- Are you kids sure?

36:46.804 --> 36:50.808
The pirates ran off with Tommie and
Brenda at the Octo Rock Lounge tonight.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.509
The Octo Rock Lounge, eh?

36:52.576 --> 36:53.844
I'll let the Sheriff know.

36:53.911 --> 36:56.246
Why don't we walk you kids
to your rooms?

36:56.313 --> 36:57.314
Cookies?

37:08.926 --> 37:14.231
Like, man, if I never set foot on
that boat again, it'll be too soon.

37:14.298 --> 37:15.666
Yeah.

37:15.733 --> 37:19.203
I've never been so bored and
so terrified at the same time!

37:20.055 --> 37:22.407
Bored? On the Salty Brick?
That's impossible.

37:22.472 --> 37:26.243
I understand you used to lead tours
of the Salty Brick, Mr. Holdout.

37:26.310 --> 37:30.514
Oh yes, way back when
before... the accident.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.117
Is that Belle and Bash's parrot?

37:33.650 --> 37:35.352
It sure is.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.388
His name was Aloysius Featherton
Scourgebottom Wendellwing Crackers IV.

37:38.455 --> 37:40.257
Try saying that three times fast.

37:40.324 --> 37:43.160
Aloysius Featherton Scourgebottom
Wendellwing Crackers IV.

37:43.227 --> 37:46.030
Aloysius Featherton Scourgebottom
Wendellwing Crackers IV.

37:46.096 --> 37:49.433
Aloysius Featherton Scourgebottom
Wendellwing Crackers IV.

37:49.499 --> 37:51.568
All right, I guess
it's not so hard after all.

37:51.635 --> 37:54.772
Do you remember the parrot's poem
you used to recite on your tours?

37:54.839 --> 37:57.141
Oh, that? No, it's been years.

37:57.207 --> 37:58.909
If you kids don't mind,
it's getting late,

37:58.976 --> 38:00.536
and we really should be getting to bed.

38:00.577 --> 38:03.080
Yeah, besides, Velma and I
need to get up early.

38:03.147 --> 38:05.415
We're competing in the
Bingo Bash Limbo Contest.

38:05.482 --> 38:08.385
How can you two be thinking
about a limbo contest?

38:08.452 --> 38:09.820
People are missing!

38:09.887 --> 38:12.056
Yeah, like, how low can you go?

38:12.122 --> 38:13.878
Well, you two are just
jealous that Velma

38:13.879 --> 38:15.592
and I are better at having fun than you.

38:15.659 --> 38:19.229
Think after all the heavy
lifting Fred and I do on every...

38:19.296 --> 38:22.366
You two are behaving
like a couple of spoiled children.

38:22.432 --> 38:25.269
How about that Daphne getting
on our case out there?

38:25.335 --> 38:28.638
Well, I don't know, Fred.
Like, maybe she has a point.

38:28.705 --> 38:30.374
You too?

38:30.440 --> 38:33.310
Oh! First, we're too boring for
you guys, and now we're too fun!

38:33.377 --> 38:38.048
All I'm saying is you can be fun
and responsible at the same time.

38:38.115 --> 38:41.218
- Right, Scoob?
- Uh-uh, leave me out of this.

38:41.285 --> 38:43.821
Sometimes you have
to take responsibility,

38:43.888 --> 38:48.258
and I know that's a big word, dude,
but responsibility is what you need.

38:49.026 --> 38:50.694
Daphne, I...

38:56.066 --> 39:00.070
We were just trying to show
that we know how to party down.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.440
You were supposed to be investigating.

39:03.507 --> 39:07.011
Now your friends are missing and
we don't have any clues to go on.

39:07.077 --> 39:10.580
How can you and Fred be
so unconcerned about this?

39:10.647 --> 39:12.449
You wouldn't understand.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.484
Dancing tonight, I felt fun.

39:14.551 --> 39:16.854
I just wanted that feeling
to last a little longer

39:16.921 --> 39:21.091
before I go back to deductive,
rational, party-pooping old Velma.

39:21.158 --> 39:22.860
Oh, yeah?
Well, if that's how you feel,

39:22.927 --> 39:26.563
maybe Scoob and I should sleep
out in the Mystery Machine.

39:26.630 --> 39:27.832
- Fine.
- Fine!

39:27.898 --> 39:30.200
Come on, Scoob.
Scooby?

39:30.801 --> 39:31.869
Scooby-Doo?

39:31.936 --> 39:35.139
Like, Scooby-Doo, where are you?

39:35.205 --> 39:37.574
- Over here!
- Was that Scooby?

39:37.641 --> 39:38.843
I'm in here.

39:46.951 --> 39:48.518
Whoa!

39:49.854 --> 39:51.455
Huh?

39:53.924 --> 39:55.259
Huh?

39:57.794 --> 39:59.663
You guys aren't Scooby!

39:59.729 --> 40:02.799
How did we ever get by without your
brilliant powers of observation?

40:02.867 --> 40:04.835
Ha-ha. Where's Scooby?

40:04.902 --> 40:06.103
Back here!

40:11.075 --> 40:13.010
These must be the tunnels
the smugglers built

40:13.077 --> 40:15.745
back when the city
was a safe haven for pirates.

40:15.812 --> 40:18.315
Neato. Let's explore.

40:18.382 --> 40:21.685
- I don't know.
- We do have to be up early for limbo.

40:21.751 --> 40:24.855
You guys aren't going to give
up exploring secret tunnels

40:24.922 --> 40:27.391
for a silly limbo contest, are you?

40:27.457 --> 40:30.394
Like, a limbo contest doesn't
even make sense!

40:30.460 --> 40:31.896
Where's the competition?

40:31.962 --> 40:35.499
We all bend at exactly the same height.

40:35.565 --> 40:37.167
You guys coming or what?

40:37.968 --> 40:39.169
- Okay.
- I guess.

40:50.580 --> 40:51.781
Do you guys hear that?

40:51.848 --> 40:53.783
It's coming from over here.

40:57.187 --> 41:00.290
And yet, you're both rude.
You're rude, ill-mannered kids.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.659
The way you've been treating
those nice, young teens.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.194
We raised you better than that!

41:04.261 --> 41:05.963
Like, what are they saying?

41:06.030 --> 41:09.699
I don't feel right spying on those
nice people and their rude children.

41:09.766 --> 41:12.637
Well, then get out of the way
and let someone else listen.

41:17.841 --> 41:20.510
Must have been the wind.
You kids go off to bed now.

41:20.577 --> 41:22.379
You can't tell us when to go to bed!

41:22.446 --> 41:24.915
We're teenagers.
We do what we want.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.183
- And besides...
- March!

41:28.485 --> 41:29.954
Honey, you still got it.

41:30.020 --> 41:33.123
Come on, Rob.
We've got work to do.

41:33.190 --> 41:34.424
It's kinda getting late.

41:34.491 --> 41:36.060
We should probably turn in, too.

41:44.434 --> 41:46.436
Does anybody remember which...

41:46.503 --> 41:48.038
I think it was that one.

41:54.411 --> 41:56.113
I don't think it was that one.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.984
Like, it's been forever and
there hasn't been one doorway.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.551
Maybe we should turn back.

42:01.618 --> 42:04.921
Or stop for a midnight snack.

42:04.989 --> 42:08.858
Sorry, guys. These tunnels must
go all throughout the city.

42:08.925 --> 42:11.128
Wait, I see a light up ahead.

42:16.733 --> 42:18.035
Is it the inn?

42:18.102 --> 42:19.836
No, I think it's the police station.

42:19.903 --> 42:23.307
Let's just get out of this tunnel.

42:23.373 --> 42:24.908
Hold on, someone's coming.

42:24.975 --> 42:26.176
Let me look.

42:32.382 --> 42:34.584
It looks like they're making furniture.

42:34.651 --> 42:37.621
Why would they be building furniture
in the middle of the night?

42:37.687 --> 42:39.389
Like man, who cares?

42:39.456 --> 42:42.292
Let's just get in there and apologize
for coming through their painting

42:42.359 --> 42:44.461
and get back to our rooms.

42:44.528 --> 42:48.832
Like, I am bushed and way
overdue for my midnight snack.

42:48.898 --> 42:50.100
Shaggy, wait!

42:55.505 --> 42:57.741
- What was that?
- I don't know.

42:57.807 --> 42:58.875
Let's check outside.

42:58.942 --> 43:00.510
Help me push this against the wall.

43:06.116 --> 43:07.517
Okay, they're gone now.
Let's go.

43:12.456 --> 43:13.557
It's stuck.

43:13.623 --> 43:16.226
Man, oh, man, who built
a smuggling tunnel

43:16.293 --> 43:17.794
you can't smuggle things out of?

43:17.861 --> 43:20.664
We'll just have to keep
looking for another exit.

43:20.730 --> 43:21.765
Come on.

43:27.837 --> 43:31.541
That's it!
I am freaking out, man!

43:31.608 --> 43:32.576
I can't go on!

43:32.642 --> 43:33.810
Let's face it.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.212
We're mole people now.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.614
We'll just spend the rest
of our lives underground.

43:37.681 --> 43:41.085
Just the five of us,
and that crab over there,

43:41.151 --> 43:44.388
building a new underground society.

43:44.454 --> 43:46.790
Shaggy, snap out of it!

43:48.392 --> 43:52.562
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm just so tired and hungry.

43:52.629 --> 43:54.364
So, so very hungry.

43:54.431 --> 43:57.033
You think any of these rocks are edible?

43:57.101 --> 44:00.304
Hold on a second. Did you
say, "That crab over there"?

44:00.370 --> 44:02.072
Yeah, that little guy over there.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.441
Hey, we could eat that crab!

44:04.508 --> 44:05.509
Yeah!

44:07.444 --> 44:10.214
If there's a crab, then we
must be close to the shore

44:10.280 --> 44:11.315
and an exit.

44:11.381 --> 44:13.450
Come on, gang, follow that crab.

44:21.991 --> 44:23.593
It's the Salty Brick.

44:23.660 --> 44:26.196
Not that creepy old pirate ship again!

44:26.263 --> 44:30.400
Jeepers. How did they manage to get the
ship in through that tiny opening?

44:30.467 --> 44:32.436
They must have sailed it in
during low tide,

44:32.502 --> 44:34.238
when the opening would be larger.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.072
Pretty ingenious.

44:36.140 --> 44:37.740
From the outside, you wouldn't
even know there was a cave here

44:37.741 --> 44:38.742
most of the time.

44:38.808 --> 44:40.310
Well, let's check it out.

44:40.377 --> 44:43.580
- No way, no how.
- Nuh-uh.

44:43.647 --> 44:46.116
I thought you said you wanted
to investigate this case?

44:46.183 --> 44:48.051
I'm tired, I'm hungry, my legs are sore,

44:48.118 --> 44:51.155
and I've already been chased
off that boat once today.

44:51.221 --> 44:53.423
There is nothing you can say or do

44:53.490 --> 44:56.893
to get me and Scooby to go
back on that creepy old ship.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.728
I can think of something.

44:58.795 --> 45:00.096
You wouldn't dare!

45:00.164 --> 45:02.031
- Would you do it...
- Don't say it!

45:02.098 --> 45:03.300
- For a...
- Please, no!

45:03.367 --> 45:04.734
Scooby Snack?

45:04.801 --> 45:06.303
Stand firm, old buddy.

45:06.370 --> 45:09.806
We do not need it.
We are better than this!

45:09.873 --> 45:11.441
Two Scooby Snacks?

45:11.508 --> 45:13.643
Nuh-uh. We have our dignity.

45:13.710 --> 45:17.747
Like, we are a united front,
and you shall never break us.

45:17.814 --> 45:18.982
Three Scooby Snacks?

45:19.048 --> 45:21.651
Yes, absolutely.
Just give us the snacks!

45:21.718 --> 45:23.153
We'll do anything!

45:23.220 --> 45:25.689
We're weak.

45:25.755 --> 45:26.823
So weak!

45:50.247 --> 45:52.482
It's Brenda and Tommie!

45:52.549 --> 45:54.418
Thank goodness you guys showed up.

45:54.484 --> 45:55.952
Just in time, too.

45:56.019 --> 45:57.621
What do you mean, "just in time"?

45:57.687 --> 46:00.557
Those creepy pirate kooks said
they'd be coming back at dawn.

46:00.624 --> 46:02.192
Of course!

46:02.259 --> 46:04.126
According to the poem, they're
supposed to shake hands at dawn

46:04.127 --> 46:05.128
for the treasure.

46:05.195 --> 46:07.096
That's not too long from now.

46:07.163 --> 46:08.998
Hmm... Well, then.

46:09.065 --> 46:10.133
We'll have to work fast.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.068
I think you mean, like, walk fast,

46:12.135 --> 46:14.370
as in, run, as in, let's get out of
here before the pirates show up?

46:14.371 --> 46:17.941
Sorry, Shaggy. This may be our only
chance to get the drop on them

46:18.007 --> 46:19.343
and we've got to take it.

46:19.409 --> 46:21.511
Tommie, Brenda, you guys get help.

46:21.578 --> 46:23.247
We're gonna stay here and set up a trap.

46:23.313 --> 46:26.516
- Right on.
- Be safe, Fredman.

46:26.583 --> 46:28.952
Maybe Scoob and I should go with them.

46:29.018 --> 46:30.887
Yeah, Fredman, with them.

46:30.954 --> 46:33.156
Shaggy, Scooby, I need you
to go gather some wood

46:33.223 --> 46:36.059
from those walkways down there and
come back as fast as you can.

46:36.125 --> 46:39.696
Like, dude, I'm starting
to miss party animal Fred.

46:39.763 --> 46:41.164
Come on, Scoob.

46:41.231 --> 46:43.933
Daphne, Velma, you two help me
gather up some nets and rope.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.004
If this works, we'll be back on
the beach having fun in no time.

46:48.071 --> 46:49.739
That reminds me.

46:49.806 --> 46:51.974
We really should try to come
up with some new dance moves.

46:51.975 --> 46:54.343
I wouldn't want people to think
we're a couple of one-trick ponies.

46:54.344 --> 46:56.145
Good thinking.

46:56.212 --> 46:58.282
Maybe if we move our arms
and legs kinda like...

47:03.086 --> 47:05.355
Guys, seriously? Focus.

47:06.990 --> 47:08.658
- Uh, right.
- Sorry.

47:10.026 --> 47:11.027
That wasn't bad.

47:11.094 --> 47:12.829
It's no Jinky, but not bad.

47:12.896 --> 47:13.897
Guys!

47:17.367 --> 47:20.604
That ought to do.
Let's get these planks back to Fred.

47:20.670 --> 47:22.339
Right.

47:22.406 --> 47:24.374
- Uh-oh.
- What is it?

47:24.441 --> 47:25.842
Look for yourself.

47:25.909 --> 47:28.478
Hold on, I can't see.
Let me put these down.

47:30.046 --> 47:31.815
Oh, excuse me,

47:31.881 --> 47:34.784
would you mind holding these for
me just for a second? Thanks.

47:34.851 --> 47:36.486
Oh, I see.

47:36.553 --> 47:38.355
Boy, do I feel silly.

47:38.422 --> 47:40.457
Like, how oblivious can you get?

47:40.524 --> 47:44.328
P-Pirates.

47:44.394 --> 47:46.195
P-Pirates?

47:46.262 --> 47:48.865
Pirates!

47:48.932 --> 47:50.199
I'll take these back now.

47:50.266 --> 47:52.736
New plan. Put the planks back!

47:56.706 --> 47:58.007
I think this might work.

47:58.074 --> 48:00.744
Yeah, it seems like a pretty solid trap.

48:00.810 --> 48:03.447
No. I mean this pivoting
motion I'm doing.

48:03.513 --> 48:05.033
I think with the right musical beat...

48:05.081 --> 48:06.316
Fred!

48:06.383 --> 48:08.151
Right... Right.
Focus. I... I'll stop.

48:08.217 --> 48:09.819
- Fred!
- I said I'll stop!

48:09.886 --> 48:12.856
- Daphne! Velma!
- It's Shaggy.

48:12.922 --> 48:14.624
Pirates!

48:16.192 --> 48:17.961

49:37.106 --> 49:38.808
Who are you calling "dogs"?

49:38.875 --> 49:39.876
Hey!

49:39.943 --> 49:40.977
No offense, Scoob.

49:41.044 --> 49:44.448
It's time ye all be walking the plank.

49:48.618 --> 49:51.588
Great. Now we'll never be
Captains of the Bash.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.289
That's what you're worried about?

49:53.356 --> 49:54.758
It's a big deal.

49:54.824 --> 49:58.361
I was almost officially
and verifiably fun.

49:58.428 --> 50:01.297
I'm sorry I teased you
guys about being boring.

50:01.364 --> 50:03.066
I'm sorry we got carried away.

50:03.132 --> 50:04.901
And I'm sorry to interrupt,

50:04.968 --> 50:07.671
but I thought ye all
were walking the plank.

50:07.737 --> 50:10.607
Yeah. Less talking and more walking.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.544
Well, this is it.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.682
I guess we better jump, guys.

50:18.748 --> 50:20.216
What's the hurry?

50:20.283 --> 50:22.285
I think it's time...

50:44.373 --> 50:45.909
Pedal to the medal, Tommie.

50:45.975 --> 50:48.978
Looks like those pirates are
steering their ship around.

50:52.816 --> 50:55.118
They'll never be able to
make it through there.

50:55.184 --> 50:56.520
They'll have to wait hours

50:56.586 --> 50:58.287
for the tide to get
low enough to sail out.

51:00.089 --> 51:01.758
Or they could do that.

51:18.341 --> 51:20.544
Oh, this is fun!

51:24.147 --> 51:26.750
Hey, everybody.
Look out there.

51:31.387 --> 51:34.758
It looks like Brenda,
Tommie and the new kids!

51:34.824 --> 51:37.126
And the pirates.

51:37.193 --> 51:38.562
Almost to shore, gang.

51:38.628 --> 51:41.598
I just wanted to have
a fun, relaxing weekend.

51:41.665 --> 51:44.233
Next time, I'll just stay
home and read a book.

51:47.804 --> 51:51.440
Come on, everybody, let's
give those pirates what for.

51:51.507 --> 51:53.009
Yeah!

51:54.611 --> 51:56.079
We made it.

52:03.519 --> 52:05.054
Return fire!

52:21.404 --> 52:23.573
Fire. Fire.

53:21.064 --> 53:22.999
Gosh, I'm really sorry about your inn

53:23.066 --> 53:25.468
and the rest of the boardwalk,
Mr. and Mrs. Holdout.

53:25.534 --> 53:27.003
Do you think you'll rebuild?

53:27.070 --> 53:28.071
Oh, heavens, no.

53:28.137 --> 53:29.939
Most of those places were so old,

53:30.006 --> 53:32.676
we don't even have the
instructions for them anymore.

53:32.742 --> 53:35.011
No. I'm sorry to say
we already agreed to sell

53:35.078 --> 53:39.683
Mr. Monkfish our land and what's left
of the boardwalk tomorrow morning.

53:42.118 --> 53:45.221
Sorry, we've got no other choice.

53:45.288 --> 53:46.622
That's right.

53:46.690 --> 53:49.158
I'd like to say I'm sad to
see you go, but point of fact,

53:49.225 --> 53:50.393
I'm over the moon.

53:50.459 --> 53:53.562
Mr. Monkfish, this is hardly
the time or place.

53:53.629 --> 53:55.498
Where's your sense of decency?

53:55.564 --> 53:58.134
"Decency", he says!

53:58.201 --> 53:59.002
Oh, that's rich.

53:59.068 --> 54:00.737
- You believe that?
- Yeah.

54:00.804 --> 54:02.171
Oh, what do you know.

54:02.238 --> 54:04.874
What does "SD" stand for,
anyway, Strange Dog?

54:04.941 --> 54:07.443
I'll tell you all who the
decent ones around here are.

54:07.510 --> 54:08.845
Those pirates, that's who.

54:08.912 --> 54:10.413
I'd like to shake their hands.

54:10.479 --> 54:12.982
Hands or hooks or whatever
they've got, I'll shake it.

54:13.049 --> 54:15.518
Not only have they put an end
to all your cheap, low class,

54:15.584 --> 54:17.453
Bingo Bash shenanigans,

54:17.520 --> 54:20.389
they've also paved the way for my
ultra-modern high-end pier complex.

54:20.456 --> 54:22.390
They even did the most of
the demolition work for me,

54:22.391 --> 54:23.826
how about that?
When I build up this...

54:23.827 --> 54:25.962
Oh, can it, you loudmouth.

54:26.029 --> 54:27.263
Mitzi!

54:27.330 --> 54:29.665
Why I never...
Never in all my life...

54:29.733 --> 54:30.867
Apologize this instant!

54:30.934 --> 54:33.102
I apologize, all right.

54:33.169 --> 54:35.338
I'm sorry I ever started
working for you.

54:35.404 --> 54:38.574
I'm sorry I actually defended you
when people said you were rotten.

54:38.641 --> 54:43.212
And I'm sorry I didn't see you for
what you are a whole lot sooner.

54:44.914 --> 54:46.750
This is my hometown.

54:46.816 --> 54:48.351
It's where I grew up.

54:48.417 --> 54:50.286
And now, it's nothing.

54:50.353 --> 54:52.221
If you were any kind of human being,

54:52.288 --> 54:55.158
you would see how
hurt I am, but you're not.

54:55.224 --> 54:57.293
You're just a greedy troll
that moved out

54:57.360 --> 55:00.429
from under his bridge and set
up shop on a pier.

55:00.496 --> 55:03.699
I'm hurt. You were like the
daughter I never had.

55:03.767 --> 55:05.835
You have three daughters!

55:05.902 --> 55:07.536
Three? Huh, that's a lot.

55:07.603 --> 55:09.638
Well, you were like
the fourth I never had.

55:09.705 --> 55:11.040
But now you're nothing to me.

55:11.107 --> 55:13.376
Just like the rest of these
screwy misfits.

55:13.442 --> 55:14.510
As for you two,

55:14.577 --> 55:15.945
this changes nothing.

55:16.012 --> 55:18.014
We made a deal and I expect to see you

55:18.081 --> 55:20.649
at the pier tomorrow morning
to finalize the paperwork.

55:20.716 --> 55:21.885
We'll be there.

55:21.951 --> 55:23.119
Unlike you,

55:23.186 --> 55:24.653
we handle ourselves with dignity.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.689
That's right. Dignity.

55:26.756 --> 55:28.892
Now buzz off, you hopeless clod!

55:28.958 --> 55:30.659
You don't have to ask me twice.

55:30.726 --> 55:32.461
I'm giving you a second chance.

55:32.528 --> 55:34.297
What for? I don't know.

55:34.363 --> 55:36.331
But if you come with me now, I'm
willing to forgive everything.

55:36.332 --> 55:39.969
I believe the lady said buzz off!

55:40.603 --> 55:42.371
Et tu, Mitzi?

55:44.808 --> 55:46.309
Sorry about that, everyone.

55:46.375 --> 55:49.012
I tried to talk him out of
coming down here,

55:49.078 --> 55:50.880
but when he gets an idea in his head,

55:50.947 --> 55:52.581
there's just no stopping him.

55:52.648 --> 55:54.017
That's all right, dear.

55:54.083 --> 55:56.319
It was nice to finally see
you stand up to him.

55:56.385 --> 55:59.122
Well, Laura, honey, we should
probably get going.

55:59.188 --> 56:02.391
No use sitting around, moping
about what's already over.

56:02.458 --> 56:03.492
Agreed.

56:03.559 --> 56:06.562
Chad, Krissy, come on, we're leaving.

56:06.629 --> 56:07.763
Bye, everyone.

56:07.831 --> 56:09.298
Bye.

56:10.499 --> 56:12.535
Bye.

56:12.601 --> 56:15.203
Well, on the bright side, at least now
we'll be Captains of the Bash for life.

56:15.204 --> 56:17.794
Yeah. You can all take
comfort knowing that

56:17.795 --> 56:20.443
the last captains were
the coolest captains.

56:20.509 --> 56:21.845
Oh, get lost, creeps.

56:21.911 --> 56:24.680
Sorry. Only losers get lost.

56:24.747 --> 56:26.049
We're out.

56:26.115 --> 56:29.318
Smell you later, beach bummers!

56:29.385 --> 56:33.422
Well, I guess Mr. Holdout's
right. It's over.

56:33.489 --> 56:34.858
No more Bingo Bash.

56:34.924 --> 56:37.927
- No more captains.
- No more boardwalk.

56:37.994 --> 56:40.263
I can't believe the
Holdouts are selling.

56:40.329 --> 56:41.330
It's over.

56:42.598 --> 56:44.100
Wait, it's not over.

56:44.167 --> 56:45.902
There's still one more day.

56:45.969 --> 56:48.471
Fredman, I admire your attitude.

56:48.537 --> 56:50.273
But look around. Game over.

56:50.339 --> 56:51.540
No.

56:51.607 --> 56:53.576
We still need to crown the
Captains of the Bash.

56:53.642 --> 56:55.011
Oh, Fred, give it up.

56:55.078 --> 56:57.746
This isn't about being
fun or cool anymore.

56:57.813 --> 56:59.048
It's not about all that.

56:59.115 --> 57:01.417
It's about teamwork and not giving up.

57:01.484 --> 57:02.886
Gather around, everyone.

57:02.952 --> 57:04.153
I've got a plan.

57:12.795 --> 57:15.531
Hey, Sheriff!
Come on down to the pier.

57:27.110 --> 57:28.978
When you guys are done there, stop by!

57:29.045 --> 57:30.579
Right next to the roller coaster.

57:30.646 --> 57:33.816
I did not give you permission
to use my pier.

57:33.883 --> 57:35.584
Come down here right now!

57:35.651 --> 57:36.886
Sorry, can't.

57:36.953 --> 57:38.454
No dogs allowed.

57:39.522 --> 57:40.924
We'll see about this!

57:44.627 --> 57:47.196
All right, are we all
clear on what to do?

57:47.263 --> 57:49.398
- I think so.
- Once they show up,

57:49.465 --> 57:51.567
they're gonna be coming after you.

57:51.634 --> 57:55.171
Just lure them to that spot and then
make sure you get out of the way.

57:55.238 --> 57:56.805
- Daphne? Velma?
- We know.

57:56.872 --> 57:59.342
Be prepared to spring the
net when they hit that spot.

57:59.408 --> 58:02.511
And stand by on the
secondary net, just in case.

58:02.578 --> 58:03.379
We got it.

58:03.446 --> 58:05.481
It's not rocket science, friend.

58:09.685 --> 58:12.355
That's the go sign.
No turning back now.

58:13.556 --> 58:15.391
Hello, Bingo Bashers!

58:17.460 --> 58:19.728
Now, as you all know, each
year at the end of the Bash

58:19.795 --> 58:23.899
we crown the two people who really
stood out as the lives of the party.

58:23.967 --> 58:24.968
And this year...

58:42.485 --> 58:44.253
Not so fast, boyo.

58:44.320 --> 58:46.722
We're putting an end to this party

58:46.789 --> 58:48.391
once and for all.

58:48.457 --> 58:51.627
There'll be no more captains.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.262
It ends with us.

58:54.563 --> 58:55.564
Oh, no.

58:55.631 --> 58:57.400
Please, don't hurt us.

58:57.466 --> 58:58.667
Yeah, please.

58:58.734 --> 59:00.636
Don't come after us.

59:00.703 --> 59:02.338
You? No.

59:02.405 --> 59:04.807
Obviously it'd be them we're after.

59:04.873 --> 59:08.677
Aye. They'd be the obvious
choice for captains.

59:08.744 --> 59:10.513
Us? You really think so?

59:10.579 --> 59:11.580
Jinkies!

59:11.647 --> 59:12.615
Guys!

59:12.681 --> 59:14.217
- Sorry.
- Aye!

59:14.283 --> 59:16.252
You're the ones everyone follows.

59:16.319 --> 59:19.622
And you're the ones we're gonna stop.

59:19.688 --> 59:21.757
Oh, new plan.

59:21.824 --> 59:23.592
- Everybody...
- Run!

01:00:03.899 --> 01:00:06.035
Scoob!

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:38.367
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:00:56.685 --> 01:00:58.587
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.693
Smile.

01:01:06.895 --> 01:01:08.631
Hmm!

01:01:09.498 --> 01:01:10.566
Hey, hey!

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:32.655
Hey, we were here first.

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:49.772
Huh?

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:57.713
Boy, how about those pirates thinking
we deserve to be Bash Captains.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.220
Maybe we could discuss this sometime

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:00.849
when we're not running for our lives.

01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:03.186
On the one hand, it's pretty flattering.

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.687
On the other hand, though,

01:02:04.753 --> 01:02:07.122
it really threw my plan for a loop.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.592
Fred, that's it! A loop!

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:17.166
Hey, everyone, try to lure them
over to the roller coaster.

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:19.468
Shaggy, Scooby, come with me.

01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:32.014
- Where did they go?
- We're over here, you soggy bilge rats.

01:02:42.157 --> 01:02:44.927
- Now we've gotcha!
- Sorry.

01:02:44.993 --> 01:02:46.094
- Uh?
- What?

01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:48.431
Bye-bye, we were just leaving.

01:03:05.147 --> 01:03:06.915
Ha-ha, fooled you.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.896
Not again.

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.901
Uh-oh!

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:41.284
- Help!
- Stop the car!

01:03:47.756 --> 01:03:49.358
Whoo-hoo!

01:03:52.961 --> 01:03:53.962
Huh?

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:16.552
Come on, we've got
to help Shaggy and Scooby.

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:18.321
Velma, I need you at the stage.

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:20.456
Daphne, get up to the Ferris wheel.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.591
Okay, everyone, teamwork!

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.388
Not again!

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:54.657
Scooby, old pal, this is it.

01:04:54.723 --> 01:04:56.224
My one regret...

01:04:56.291 --> 01:05:00.028
...is that I didn't eat
more Scooby Snacks.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.870
- Yikes!
- Oh!

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.883
Now to see who these pirates really are.

01:05:22.217 --> 01:05:23.852
Chad and Krissy!

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:27.923
Oh, kids, how could you?

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.192
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

01:05:30.258 --> 01:05:33.529
That's right, they just couldn't
let go of their titles.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:34.763
Release us this instant.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.432
We are your captains.

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.300
Ah, that's just sad.

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:42.070
I couldn't figure out the motivation
behind the pirate's attacks.

01:05:42.137 --> 01:05:44.407
At first I thought
they wanted their hats back

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:45.973
because the hats
were mentioned in that poem

01:05:45.974 --> 01:05:48.210
about finding the missing treasure.

01:05:48.276 --> 01:05:52.080
But if that were the case, why did they
keep attacking once they had the hats?

01:05:52.147 --> 01:05:55.017
Obviously they wanted to stop
the Bash for some reason.

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:58.821
So I figured by announcing that we'd
be crowning the new Bash Captains,

01:05:58.887 --> 01:06:01.690
that would be enough to lure
the culprits into our trap.

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:03.492
Wait a second!
Didn't this all start

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.828
because the hats were
stolen off of their heads?

01:06:05.894 --> 01:06:07.463
Like, how could they steal the hats

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.797
off of their own heads?

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.466
Unless...

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:13.502
Like, they were really ghost
pirates the whole time.

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.673
No, they're not.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.209
Also, how could they have been at the
Octo Rock Lounge being mean to you guys

01:06:21.276 --> 01:06:23.712
at the same time they were
chasing Shaggy and Scooby

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.981
- around the Salty Brick?
- Yeah.

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:28.751
- Easy, they didn't.
- What?

01:06:28.817 --> 01:06:30.553
Well, you heard the girl,
they're innocent.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.788
Best untie them and we'll be on our way.

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:33.922
Not so fast.

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:36.892
They're didn't, their partners did.

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:38.827
You see, I first struck upon the idea

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:41.063
that it wasn't just one set of pirates

01:06:41.129 --> 01:06:43.031
but two, when Mr. Holdout here told us

01:06:43.098 --> 01:06:46.201
the best way to solve this case
would be to work as a team.

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.670
My suspicions were confirmed

01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:49.472
when I noticed that one set of pirates

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.874
seemed to move slower than the others.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.542
Not to mention Belle switched from being

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:55.944
left-handed to right-handed
and back again.

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.412
So I asked myself,

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.960
who would know enough about this town

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:01.216
and its past to pull of these crimes?

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.452
Who would benefit from the
destruction of the boardwalk

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:07.523
both monetarily, and by destroying
any evidence of their crimes?

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.592
And who would know enough
about the Salty Brick

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:11.560
to expertly sail it into a secret harbor

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:13.562
in an attempt
to try to find the treasure?

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:16.665
I know! It was
that boring old museum guy.

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:18.601
I never trusted him.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:23.371
I'm innocent, I tell you.
You'll never catch me alive!

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:29.011
No. Again, no.

01:07:29.077 --> 01:07:32.380
It was none other
than Mr. and Mrs. Holdout.

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:36.919
- What?
- You've got no evidence.

01:07:36.985 --> 01:07:39.555
- That is just plain absurd.
- Is it?

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:43.458
Mrs. Holdout, I noticed when you checked
us in, that you were left-handed.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.361
Mr. Holdout, you could remember
the ridiculously long name

01:07:46.428 --> 01:07:49.732
of a long-dead parrot and every
other detail about the pirates.

01:07:49.798 --> 01:07:52.935
But when it came to reciting a poem
that might lead us to suspect you,

01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:54.937
you had conveniently forgotten it.

01:07:55.003 --> 01:07:58.040
You also were surprised to hear
Brenda and Tommie had gone missing,

01:07:58.106 --> 01:08:00.609
but not that the Salty Brick
had been stolen.

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.645
And when we made a noise
in the secret passageway

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.479
you all looked towards the painting,

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:07.014
whereas the police assumed, when
we made a noise in their wall,

01:08:07.015 --> 01:08:08.651
that it must have come from outside.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.218
Wait, you were where now?

01:08:10.285 --> 01:08:12.855
You even said to Mr. Monkfish
when he was accusing you

01:08:12.921 --> 01:08:16.424
that you would see the boardwalk
destroyed before you sold it to him.

01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:19.828
Oh, Rob, I've always said
you talk too much.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.964
All right, fine, it's all true.

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:23.799
And we would've
gotten away with it, too,

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.801
if it weren't for our meddling kids.

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.636
- Hey!
- Well, it's true.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.304
I had the whole thing worked out...

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:30.773
Been planning it for years.

01:08:30.839 --> 01:08:33.308
I even let all the insufferable teens

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.443
of this town play our boardwalk games

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:37.112
and ride the attractions for free

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:40.247
so they'd vote our rotten kids captains.

01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:41.584
I had to get those hats.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:43.551
It's in the poem...
"Tip our hats,

01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:45.520
"great treasure," yada, yada, yada.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.823
Only we had those hats for a year.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:51.193
Tipped them all over town,
shook hands every dawn,

01:08:51.259 --> 01:08:53.428
- and no treasure.
- Right.

01:08:53.495 --> 01:08:55.524
I thought if I could
just have a little more

01:08:55.526 --> 01:08:57.465
time with them, I could
find the treasure.

01:08:57.532 --> 01:08:59.466
So we stole the hats.

01:08:59.533 --> 01:09:02.738
Then things got out of hand with Chad
and Krissy kidnapping those teens.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:05.540
Sorry, Brenda. Sorry, Tommie.

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:07.274
And then we blew up the boardwalk.

01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.377
Sorry about that, everyone.
Oopsie, our bad.

01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:12.814
That way we could destroy
those incriminating tunnels

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.817
and then sell the whole
thing off to Monkfish.

01:09:14.883 --> 01:09:17.484
So at least we could make some
money from this whole fiasco.

01:09:17.551 --> 01:09:20.689
And that explains why they
sabotaged my roller coaster.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.356
Wait, no it doesn't.
Why did you do that?

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:24.792
- We didn't.
- But I know who did.

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:26.560
You see, I first realized that...

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:30.165
Ugh, look, sweetheart, I've already
sat through two of these reveals.

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:32.033
You think you could
just cut to the chase?

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.368
Ooh, but I never get to do these.

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.939
Ah, fine. It was
the Sheriff and the Deputy.

01:09:37.005 --> 01:09:38.841
We saw them building office furniture

01:09:38.907 --> 01:09:41.308
out of pieces of your roller coaster
in order to hide the evidence.

01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:43.911
They wanted to destroy tourism so
they wouldn't have to work so hard.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:49.685
Huh, so you're saying I didn't do any
of the crimes this weekend? Weird.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.319
I would have put my money on me.

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:54.022
I mean, I'm such a greedy businessman.

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:56.859
That's right, we did it.
So what?

01:09:56.925 --> 01:09:58.493
How are you going to arrest us?

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.195
We're the only law in this town.

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:03.799
- Check and mate.
- Or, is it?

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.702
Dr. Najib!

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.336
Hey, guys.

01:10:08.403 --> 01:10:10.238
What, you all know this guy?

01:10:10.305 --> 01:10:11.239
I couldn't help it.

01:10:11.306 --> 01:10:13.241
He made it sound like so much fun

01:10:13.308 --> 01:10:16.544
and he promised to go to jail
right after the Bash.

01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:19.581
I believe my friend here could
help in arresting these gentlemen.

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:22.685
Oof, I don't know. That
sounds like a lot of work.

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:28.490
Okay, I could never say no to you.

01:10:28.556 --> 01:10:29.958
Come on, everybody.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:34.963
You'll all have to scooch into the
back of my car. I hope that's okay.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.299
If it helps I could drive separately.

01:10:37.365 --> 01:10:38.967
That'd be great. Oh!

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:42.070
Oh, no you don't. You!

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.006
What am I gonna do with you?

01:10:44.072 --> 01:10:46.608
Take you to jail, that's what.

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:49.177
Well, bye again, everybody.

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:50.245
Bye.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.347
Well, I guess that's everything.

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.849
Not totally.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.783
Don't you wanna know
where the hidden treasure is?

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:57.720
You mean you know?

01:10:57.786 --> 01:11:00.666
Pretty easy when you've been cracking
poem-based clues as long as I have.

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:04.259
Brenda, Tommie, will you take these
hats over to the front of the ship?

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:10.165
So the poem says, "Go on bow."

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:12.701
The bow is what you call
the front of a ship.

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:15.003
Now, if you guys will tip the hats.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.108
So the next part says,

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:22.110
"At the dawn,
shake hands for good measure."

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:25.147
Young lady, dawn isn't
for another 10 hours.

01:11:25.213 --> 01:11:28.450
I'd like to wrap this up
and get dinner sometime soon.

01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:30.118
If that's okay with you.

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.888
See, that's
the mistake Mr. Holdout made.

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.157
"Dawn" isn't referring
to the time of day.

01:11:35.223 --> 01:11:37.893
The figurehead on
the Salty Brick is of Aurora,

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.062
the Roman goddess of the dawn.

01:11:40.128 --> 01:11:42.898
Brenda, Tommie, shake her hands.

01:11:58.346 --> 01:12:02.384
- Holy moly!
- Look at all them sparklers.

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:03.268
Wow!

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:07.489
By my estimation there should be
enough there to rebuild the boardwalk.

01:12:07.555 --> 01:12:11.059
But the Holdouts already sold
the boardwalk to Mr. Monkfish.

01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:16.398
Ah, go ahead and take it back.

01:12:16.464 --> 01:12:19.301
We've already had
too many bad guys today as is.

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:21.203
Yay!

01:12:21.269 --> 01:12:23.338
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:26.942
Ah, who could blame you,
I'm very unlikable.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.677
Fred, Velma, I think
I speak for everybody here

01:12:29.744 --> 01:12:30.979
when I say,

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.414
we want to name the two of you

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.350
this year's Captains of the Bash.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.827
Yeah, you guys might not be
the loosest cats around,

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:46.761
but you never gave up on the party

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:49.597
and that's the true spirit of the Bash.

01:12:49.664 --> 01:12:51.266
Thanks, but no thanks.

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.768
We're retiring
from the party animal life.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:57.472
Fun was fun, but deep down our
hearts are as square as they get.

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:59.607
But I can think
of three worthy replacements

01:12:59.674 --> 01:13:01.877
who never gave up on this case.

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:04.079
Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby.

01:13:11.419 --> 01:13:13.255
What are your orders, my captains?

01:13:13.321 --> 01:13:16.825
Let's party!

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:15.483
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:47.602
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:16:47.672 --> 01:16:55.449
