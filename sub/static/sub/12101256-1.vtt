16:18.979 --> 16:22.304
I swear, if I can save
your sister, I will.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.648
You have my word.

16:31.015 --> 16:32.097
What is wrong?

16:32.175 --> 16:37.319
What if I don't make it home,
to where I came from?

16:37.330 --> 16:41.782
Well, like my grandmother
used to say,

16:41.859 --> 16:45.244
always follow your heart
and it will always lead you

16:45.279 --> 16:46.328
down the right path.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.171
Yeah.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.633
I'll figure this all out.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.846
We need to find Alexandra
and the rest of the Sisterhood,

16:54.922 --> 16:58.182
and to do that we're gonna need
some help.

16:58.259 --> 16:59.759
Our Count.

16:59.835 --> 17:01.469
Count Dalibor.

17:01.545 --> 17:03.688
If- if anyone can aid us,
it is he.

17:03.765 --> 17:04.805
And you have access to him?

17:04.882 --> 17:06.357
I was his page in the war.

17:06.434 --> 17:07.525
I served him well.

17:07.602 --> 17:09.310
What are we waiting for?

17:09.386 --> 17:10.528
Come on.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.674
You called for me,
Count Dalibor.

17:40.751 --> 17:43.385
Is it the child?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.678
No, he is well.

17:44.755 --> 17:45.971
Surely not your wife.

17:46.048 --> 17:48.232
Both are fine.

17:48.309 --> 17:51.569
Then, pray tell,
what is it, Your Grace?

17:51.646 --> 17:56.357
Olivia and I are forever
indebted to you, Michaela.

17:56.433 --> 17:58.818
You arrived just as we had
lost all hope.

17:58.853 --> 18:03.572
But now that our son has been
born into this world-

18:03.583 --> 18:05.917
Have I done anything
to upset you?

18:05.993 --> 18:07.576
To fail you?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.538
The time is now
for my family and I

18:10.614 --> 18:13.707
to discover who we are together
for ourselves.

18:13.784 --> 18:16.836
You wish for me to leave.

18:16.912 --> 18:20.431
Does Countess Olivia
know about this?

18:20.508 --> 18:23.935
As ruler, I will decide
upon such things.

18:24.011 --> 18:25.594
You will respect that.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.888
Of course, Your Grace.

18:27.965 --> 18:31.609
It has been my honour
to serve your family.

18:31.686 --> 18:33.352
I will be gone by the morning.

18:33.429 --> 18:34.687
Long may you reign,

18:34.763 --> 18:39.659
and blessings be upon your wife
and child, long may she live.

18:47.484 --> 18:49.034
You are strong, Olivia.

18:49.111 --> 18:53.747
Stronger than you even imagine,
destined for great things,

18:53.824 --> 18:56.634
of this much I am sure.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.974
Are you sure we can trust
your Count Dalibor?

19:03.050 --> 19:04.200
Yes.

19:04.202 --> 19:05.401
A true hero of the realm,
protector of the people.

19:05.403 --> 19:07.803
He and his wife, Olivia,
are beloved by all they rule.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.480
A leader people like?

19:09.557 --> 19:10.723
Times have changed.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.817
Florian, my great squire.

19:12.894 --> 19:15.444
Let them pass, let them pass.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.564
It has been far, far too long.

19:18.599 --> 19:19.991
Yes, it has.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.442
Your majesty.

19:21.518 --> 19:24.996
Oh, and who might
this young man be?

19:25.072 --> 19:31.660
Her name is Jack, Count Dalibor,
and she's from uh...

19:31.671 --> 19:33.996
A place far, far away.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.674
And what brings you
to Transylvania, Jack?

19:36.751 --> 19:40.836
I'm trying to help
with the vampires.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.005
Vampires?

19:43.016 --> 19:48.093
That term is one from dusty
tomes filled with old legends.

19:48.128 --> 19:49.470
Vampires do not exist.

19:49.546 --> 19:50.804
But they do.

19:50.881 --> 19:54.099
Stealing victims from the town,
draining them of their blood.

19:54.176 --> 19:55.434
Do you have evidence of this?

19:55.511 --> 19:56.602
Yes.

19:56.679 --> 19:59.438
Mehai was turned into a vampire,

19:59.515 --> 20:03.817
but then somehow Jack
turned him back.

20:03.894 --> 20:05.861
It sounds impossible
but it's true.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.446
People have gone missing.

20:07.481 --> 20:08.948
They took my sister,
Count Dalibor.

20:08.983 --> 20:10.041
Alexandra.

20:10.117 --> 20:11.375
Yes.

20:11.452 --> 20:12.534
That news does concern me.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.787
I will have my men
search for her.

20:14.863 --> 20:15.788
Captain Rasto-

20:15.823 --> 20:18.040
They shouldn't go alone.
I should join them.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.875
Offer protection.

20:19.886 --> 20:24.630
Captain Rasto and his guards
are highly trained, Jack.

20:24.707 --> 20:28.726
You are merely a strangely
dressed girl from far, far away.

20:28.803 --> 20:30.552
I'm a little more than that.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.888
You don't realize the threat
that you're up against.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.558
The woods, they're full of
the Sisterhood.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.069
The what?

20:38.145 --> 20:40.738
Sisterhood?

20:40.815 --> 20:43.732
Tell me more.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.910
Mask-wearing vampires.

20:45.987 --> 20:47.987
Inverted crosses
on their forehead,

20:48.063 --> 20:50.239
dressed like leather-clad nuns.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.991
Florian.

20:52.067 --> 20:54.576
Your missing sister who
we will find is one thing

20:54.587 --> 20:57.755
but fairy tales of creatures
drinking blood is quite another.

20:57.832 --> 20:58.923
Your majesty, I beg you-

20:59.000 --> 21:03.752
You and your friend will keep
these tales of vampires

21:03.763 --> 21:05.596
to yourselves.

21:05.673 --> 21:07.881
No good can come
from creating panic.

21:07.958 --> 21:09.008
That's what you
don't understand.

21:09.084 --> 21:10.759
The panic has already set in.

21:10.770 --> 21:14.680
On your way, both of you.
On your way.

21:14.715 --> 21:15.964
Seriously?

21:15.966 --> 21:19.601
I would expect you to keep
better company, young Florian.

21:19.612 --> 21:25.950
Do not get enchanted by whispers
of magic and monsters.

21:31.899 --> 21:32.698
Help!

21:32.733 --> 21:33.699
Please!

21:33.734 --> 21:35.418
Somebody, help!

21:36.129 --> 21:37.619
I just found her, Your Grace!

21:37.630 --> 21:39.038
She's not breathing!

21:39.114 --> 21:41.465
I'm so sorry.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.800
I didn't know what to do.

21:42.877 --> 21:44.293
Stay. Stay with her.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.803
Oh- ok.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.848
My Countess, I'm so sorry.

21:51.719 --> 21:52.977
Michaela.

21:53.054 --> 21:54.053
Michaela!

21:54.088 --> 21:56.555
Olivia, she's not breathing.

21:56.590 --> 21:58.640
Do you not- do you not hear me?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.893
But you wished for me to leave.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.770
I am of little use now.

22:02.846 --> 22:04.104
She's dying, woman!

22:04.181 --> 22:06.115
Have you no heart?

22:09.019 --> 22:11.111
What would you know of my heart?

22:11.188 --> 22:13.072
I am begging you,
please just come to her.

22:13.148 --> 22:14.114
Save her.

22:14.191 --> 22:15.157
I will do anything you wish.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.917
Anything.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.676
You said they just had a baby.

22:25.753 --> 22:28.054
Yes, much to our surprise.

22:29.849 --> 22:30.681
Why?

22:30.758 --> 22:33.342
Well, they've been trying
for years.

22:33.353 --> 22:36.637
It was believed that Countess
Olivia was not capable any more.

22:36.713 --> 22:41.859
Now, a son has been born
against the odds.

22:41.936 --> 22:44.028
Luck.

22:44.105 --> 22:46.697
Word was that a midwife arrived
in the castle.

22:46.774 --> 22:51.944
It was not long after that
Olivia was carrying a child.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.278
That's a first.

22:53.313 --> 22:55.206
Doesn't the midwife usually show
up after the woman's pregnant,

22:55.282 --> 22:56.540
not before?

22:56.617 --> 22:57.783
I do not know.

22:57.818 --> 22:58.934
But it was shortly
after her arrival

22:58.936 --> 23:00.869
that word reached us
from neighbouring villages.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.204
People going missing
in the forest,

23:02.215 --> 23:03.872
strange happenings at night.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.708
And then... then it
happened here.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.718
That's the Sisterhood.

23:07.795 --> 23:09.670
The two must be
connected somehow.

23:09.746 --> 23:10.888
What troubles you?

23:10.965 --> 23:12.056
Dalibor.

23:12.133 --> 23:13.674
He seemed concerned when
I mentioned the Sisterhood.

23:13.750 --> 23:14.800
Could he know about
the vampires?

23:14.877 --> 23:15.843
No, no, no.

23:15.919 --> 23:17.136
He's a good man.

23:17.212 --> 23:18.729
He would never allow such
an evil to haunt these people.

23:18.806 --> 23:20.231
Then what about the wife,
Olivia?

23:20.307 --> 23:22.066
What do you know about her?

23:24.219 --> 23:24.977
Come this way.

23:25.053 --> 23:25.727
Come.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.196
Come, come.

23:32.436 --> 23:34.319
All the counts of Transylvania.

23:34.396 --> 23:36.956
A legacy dating back
a thousand years.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.824
Ok, that's a big family tree.

23:38.901 --> 23:39.992
So what?

23:40.068 --> 23:41.994
Only one Count has ever
requested his formal portrait

23:42.070 --> 23:45.664
be done with his wife
at his side.

23:45.699 --> 23:48.259
That is how profoundly
Dalibor loves his Olivia.

23:48.335 --> 23:50.752
Behold.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.754
This is her.

23:52.765 --> 23:57.184
<i> Olivia von Dracula.</i>

23:57.937 --> 23:59.103
<i> Dracula?</i>

23:59.180 --> 24:00.271
<i> That's her.</i>

24:00.347 --> 24:02.890
The Dark One.

24:02.966 --> 24:05.609
Now I know why my mother
sent me here.

24:12.693 --> 24:14.610
Here, my Countess.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.455
A tincture to strengthen you.

24:20.067 --> 24:27.456
What would of become of my sweet
Christoph if I had perished?

24:27.467 --> 24:28.540
And Dalibor-

24:28.617 --> 24:29.791
<i> Hush now.</i>

24:29.802 --> 24:31.376
<i> All is well.</i>

24:31.453 --> 24:33.304
You are restored.

24:33.380 --> 24:36.089
Fate brought me to your side

24:36.166 --> 24:39.435
and I will be here
as long as need be.

24:42.172 --> 24:45.816
So much seems adrift.

24:46.819 --> 24:53.324
This... this sudden illness.

24:53.400 --> 24:57.069
The stories from the villagers.

24:57.145 --> 24:58.820
What stories?

24:58.831 --> 25:00.656
The missing girls.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.575
The monsters in the forest.

25:03.652 --> 25:07.996
It is these dark fantasies that
are the root of your sickness.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.998
Who, pray tell, told you this?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.417
No one.

25:12.494 --> 25:14.512
A little birdie.

25:15.038 --> 25:17.005
There is an old proverb.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.132
Birds who sing too loudly,

25:19.209 --> 25:21.802
no matter how sweet their tune,

25:21.878 --> 25:24.522
are the first to fall
to the hunter.

25:24.598 --> 25:27.566
That is a dark thought.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.074
You must rest.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.496
A chance to clear your mind.

25:41.949 --> 25:49.547
So you may better understand
who to trust and who not to.

25:51.074 --> 25:57.629
You are pure and good of heart,
ringed in light.

25:57.664 --> 25:59.598
Like a seraph.

26:03.971 --> 26:07.898
And I find you fascinating.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.571
Olivia is of good heart.

26:22.582 --> 26:26.074
Yeah, but she doesn't stay
that way.

26:26.085 --> 26:30.579
At some point she gets corrupted
and turned into the Dark One.

26:30.590 --> 26:31.663
What happens now?

26:31.740 --> 26:33.090
Nothing good.

26:34.335 --> 26:39.588
Who knows, maybe your Count
Dalibor is the one who
turns her evil.

26:39.599 --> 26:48.680
Before Dalibor came to power
there was another Count.

26:48.757 --> 26:53.444
Anton ruled with fear.
Killing for no reason.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.615
Made his own people his slaves.

26:57.691 --> 27:02.569
And then Dalibor struck him
down, he freed us.

27:02.646 --> 27:05.280
What if Dalibor knew
years before

27:05.291 --> 27:07.949
that Anton was going to be evil.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.701
What if he could have
struck him down

27:09.736 --> 27:11.620
and stopped all the suffering.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.789
Wait, you mean to kill her?!

27:13.799 --> 27:14.965
-Shhh!!!!
-Olivia!

27:16.302 --> 27:17.793
I have a mission.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.628
I'm a Van Helsing.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.630
Surely there is another way.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.975
What if- what if you can
stop her turn so dark?

27:25.052 --> 27:26.301
Is that not the same thing?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.886
You know what that is?

27:27.963 --> 27:29.930
Because I don't.

27:30.006 --> 27:34.768
Alright, but you have to promise
me you will at least try.

27:34.845 --> 27:35.986
I implore you.

27:36.063 --> 27:38.822
She does not deserve death.

27:41.143 --> 27:42.651
Sure.

27:42.662 --> 27:43.886
Thank you.

27:43.888 --> 27:48.156
If you can get me close enough
maybe I can warn Olivia.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.783
Stop what's gonna happen to her.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.627
Of course.

27:51.945 --> 27:53.504
You need to help me
get into the castle,

27:53.580 --> 27:54.596
past all those guards.

27:54.598 --> 27:55.789
We need to create some
sort of distraction.

27:55.866 --> 28:00.001
Well, if you want to talk to her
there is a much easier way.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.295
The winter fair
in the town centre.

28:02.372 --> 28:03.363
Ok.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.007
She's due to appear to present
Count Christoph

28:06.018 --> 28:08.176
and open the festivities
in the morning.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.761
Alright.

28:09.796 --> 28:11.096
We'll get the drop
on her then.

28:11.131 --> 28:12.264
No.

28:12.299 --> 28:15.267
No one's going to drop
anything on her.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.735
Never mind.
