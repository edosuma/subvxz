00:10.051 --> 00:12.345
Oh my gosh, Lilly. I'm so sorry.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.681
When were you diagnosed?

00:15.432 --> 00:17.851
Um, about four weeks ago.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.185
[Lilly inhales deeply]

00:19.269 --> 00:22.188
I… I had a twinge in my back,

00:22.272 --> 00:26.359
um, and I'd lost some weight,
and I didn't wanna alarm anybody.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.446
So I went to see a Dr. Baines
in Clear River.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.739
She did some tests.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.241
-Did you have a CT scan?
-Yeah, in Grace Valley.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.994
What were the results?

00:37.537 --> 00:39.247
I have pancreatic cancer.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.542
Stage 4.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.170
[gasps quietly] Oh, Lilly.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.087
I know.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.423
I know.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.426
When she told me,

00:53.386 --> 00:54.262
I, um…

00:56.598 --> 00:59.184
felt like the Earth stopped spinning.

01:00.935 --> 01:04.481
-Have you had a second opinion?
-Yeah. Yeah, I have. It's the same.

01:05.899 --> 01:09.110
I'd like to list you
as my emergency contact.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.945
Uh, but what about Tara?

01:11.029 --> 01:13.740
No, I haven't told her.
I'm not ready to tell anybody.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.621
Knowing that I'm leaving my kids
without a mother is, um…

01:21.247 --> 01:22.373

01:30.215 --> 01:31.549
Lilly, what can I do?

01:32.801 --> 01:35.345
Allow me to use you as my contact.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.554
Of course.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.598
-Of course.
-Okay.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.100
But, um…

01:41.476 --> 01:44.604
with this kind of diagnosis,
the more support you have, the better.

01:44.687 --> 01:47.107
No, I… I'm not…
I don't want to go there yet.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.651
-I should be getting home.
-Okay.

01:50.568 --> 01:53.655
Um, please, please, don't tell anyone.

01:53.738 --> 01:57.033
Lilly, I… I promise I won't, but, uh, ju--

01:57.867 --> 01:59.953
God, Lilly, just… [sighs]

02:00.036 --> 02:02.622
…just know if you ever need me,
I'm here whenever.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.166
Thank you.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.844
[theme music playing]

02:25.854 --> 02:28.523
[Jack] I hoped you'd be awake
when I got home last night.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.275
I know. I'm sorry.

02:31.568 --> 02:35.989
After Lilly stopped by, I…
I was so tired, I passed out.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.032
Pretty late for a visit.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.119
Yeah, she just had some stuff
she wanted to talk about.

02:42.370 --> 02:47.083
And is "stuff"
code for "can't discuss it"?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.252
-[Mel] Mm-hmm.
-Hm.

02:57.093 --> 03:01.014
there's something
that you'd rather do instead?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.754

Hey, June.

I'd make you some eggs if I had any.

-Don't worry about it. [clears throat]
-Oh.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.974
Uh, I just need a ride back to the bar
so I can pick up my car.

Oh.

That I can do.

-Cool.
-[Brady] Cool.

See,
I would've taken you for a Harley guy.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.210
-Yep.
-Nice.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.880
So, you're into bikes?

05:39.464 --> 05:42.884
In law school, I dated a guy whose dad
was a bigwig at Triumph.

05:42.967 --> 05:43.885
Oh.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.511
I see.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.723
He was a jerk, but I loved riding
on the back of his bike.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.030
Yeah.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.283
Who said anything about hanging out?

06:08.076 --> 06:10.078
I mean, all we'd be doing is just, uh,

06:11.454 --> 06:14.582

…I just wanted to say again that I…

13:18.923 --> 13:22.760

that you don't isolate yourself

13:25.054 --> 13:25.930
Yeah.

to take this on.

with Jack and… and the clinic, and--

-Don't worry.

10:30 p.m. tonight, right?

14:04.426 --> 14:05.427
[door opens]

14:06.095 --> 14:09.014
And you're sure
that's the earliest flight available?

14:12.476 --> 14:14.436
Uh, okay. Thanks so much.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.149
-[sighs]
-Was that Hope?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.902
[sighs] Actually,
I was on with the airline.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.322
I'm flying to Atlanta,
and then I am driving to Port Royal.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.740
But all the news reports said

14:26.824 --> 14:29.535
the coastal towns in South Carolina
are flooded.

14:29.618 --> 14:32.204
Yeah, which is exactly why I am going.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.499
I can't just sit here waiting.
I've got to do something.

14:35.583 --> 14:39.253
I get it, but you don't even know
where Hope is or if you can get to her.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.214
Then I'll travel by raft,
and I'll knock on every door.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.884
I'll do whatever I have to do to find her.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.803
Doc, think about
what you could be up against here.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.015
Come on! When a city's flooded,
the water's contaminated.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.266
You can get electrocuted.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.060
What if it was Mel
who was in Port Royal right now?

14:55.144 --> 14:56.270
What would you do?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.777
All right, then I'm going with you.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.155
Look, I really appreciate the offer, but…

15:06.238 --> 15:07.364
[sighs]

15:07.448 --> 15:10.534
…I gotta do this solo.
I don't wanna put anybody else in danger.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.494
Come on. Be reasonable.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.913
Reasonable? [scoffs]

15:15.164 --> 15:17.583
You, of all people, should know

15:18.459 --> 15:22.546
that when it comes to someone you love,
reason, it doesn't stand a chance.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.094
The festival was sick.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.264
And when I heard Moon and Honey,
I started thinking about us,

15:33.057 --> 15:36.060
so I decided to make a detour
on my way back to LA.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.480
How did you know how to find me?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.982
I asked the cashier at the gas station,

15:42.066 --> 15:44.568
and he gave me the address
to your aunt's store.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.487
Everyone knows everyone around here.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.863
Yeah, I know.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.323
That freaks me out.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.491
I like my privacy.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.827
Yeah, then you're definitely
in the wrong town.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.329
I know.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.457
I came here for us.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.629
There's no us anymore.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.340
-Which is a tragedy.
-More like ancient history.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.008
[cell phone chimes]

16:08.717 --> 16:11.261
Oh, it's my aunt. I gotta get to work.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.228
But we can hang out after.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.647
All right.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.691
Where do you wanna meet?

16:24.191 --> 16:25.192
Curly's.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.945
Once I've done my shift,
I'll text you the address.

16:28.028 --> 16:28.988
Cool.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.240
I'll see you later.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.548
Hey, table six needs their burrito.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.301
-You mean Charlie?
-Yeah.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.220
That's his burrito.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.056
Which is getting cold.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.443
Uh, there you go.

17:11.488 --> 17:15.993
[nervously] So, you need hot sauce

17:16.076 --> 17:18.162
or Tabasco or…

17:18.245 --> 17:20.664
Tabasco is hot sauce, son.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.749
[laughs nervously]

17:23.500 --> 17:25.044
You got something on your mind?

17:27.004 --> 17:28.005
Um…

17:31.592 --> 17:33.719
The other day
when I saw you at the cabins,

17:33.802 --> 17:36.263
you didn't, by chance,

17:37.931 --> 17:39.641
mention it to anyone?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.478
Relax, kid.
I didn't tell anyone about your date.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.480
Oh, we were just hanging out.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.148
It's none of my business.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.566
Great. [chuckles]

17:47.649 --> 17:50.319
Uh, thank you so much for being cool.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.447
But it seems to me
that you're looking for approval.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.531
I just--

17:55.491 --> 17:58.619
-I don't want you to think less of me.
-You're 18.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.371
-You're a man now.
-[nervously] Okay…

18:01.455 --> 18:04.208
Real men
don't need the approval of others.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.919
They just need
the strength of their convictions.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.383
[chuckles softly]

18:22.184 --> 18:24.019
This place is stunning.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.480
-Yeah.
-It has The Bachelor written all over it.

18:26.980 --> 18:27.940
Never seen it.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.901
Although,
I'm assuming that means you like it.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.277
[Brie] It's like a movie set.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.532
What's your favorite movie?

18:36.615 --> 18:37.866
No, it's embarrassing.

18:37.950 --> 18:38.826
Come on.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.330
Fine. I love Legally Blonde.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.916
-[snickers]
-[Brie] Don't make fun of me.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.042
Wasn't gonna.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.127
What's yours?

18:48.210 --> 18:49.419
The Sting.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.754
Oh, I don't know that one.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.214
-You serious?
-Mm.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.717
With Paul Newman
and Robert Redford about the con job?

18:55.801 --> 18:56.844
Yeah, I don't--

18:56.927 --> 18:59.471
Oh! No, no.
We're gonna need to get you caught up.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.181
-You're missing out.
-[Brie laughs]

19:01.682 --> 19:04.017
So you are a big movie guy.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.687
Mostly the, uh, classic stuff.

19:07.604 --> 19:11.859
My parents had a messed-up relationship,
so I'd spend a lot of time with my uncle.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.070
We watched a lot of movies.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.867
So, what do you do when you're not working
or watching movies?

19:20.826 --> 19:23.203
I hang out at bars, work on my bike.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.165
-How long have you had it?
-Uh, this one? About a month.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.292
But I also have a ten-year-old Yamaha.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.544
Did you ride when you were a kid?

19:30.627 --> 19:31.461
Yep.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.255
My uncle got me into dirt biking

19:33.338 --> 19:35.507
to keep me out of trouble.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.052
Did it work?

19:40.137 --> 19:41.346
No.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.306
[chuckles]

19:44.683 --> 19:47.227
At least he tried.
That's more than my parents ever did.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.191
So, how long you in Virgin River for?

19:53.483 --> 19:54.568
[inhales]

19:54.651 --> 19:56.778
Well, I don't have anywhere I need to be.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.656
-Hm.
-And I kind of like it here.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.075
What do you like about it?

20:02.159 --> 20:03.952
-The scenery, mostly.
-Oh.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.204
-Yeah.
-[Brie chuckles]

Stacie knows that Mark and I
had fertility problems.

21:19.987 --> 21:24.866
Her sending me a sonogram certified mail
feels like she's rubbing my nose in it.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.743
Why would she do that?

21:26.827 --> 21:28.870
Because I didn't give her the ring back.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.124
Is it possible she's just being oblivious?

21:32.207 --> 21:35.127
Stacie is type A.
She doesn't do anything without a plan.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.963
If that's the case, I'm sorry.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.133
I mean, that's…
a pretty terrible thing to do.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.431
Maybe I should've just given her the ring.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.432
No! Hey, hey!

21:48.515 --> 21:50.058
That ring is yours to keep.

You want me to track her down?

21:52.978 --> 21:54.896
I don't know, give her a piece of my mind?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.399
Yeah? What would you say?

21:57.482 --> 22:01.361
Tell her to stop being passive-aggressive.
Start acting like a grown-up.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.363
You're being very cute right now.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.032
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.700
I thought I was cute all the time.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.160
You are.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.498
By the way, I went and saw Doc.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.709
How is he doing?
He's not been calling me back.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.794
No, he's planning on flying to Atlanta,

22:17.878 --> 22:20.380
and then he's gonna drive to Port Royal
to find Hope.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.507
He's gonna enter into a flood zone
by himself?

22:22.591 --> 22:24.509
I offered to go with him, but he refused.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.429
I have to go to the clinic
and straighten this out. It's--

22:29.097 --> 22:30.515
But I'll see you later, right?

22:30.599 --> 22:31.600
-Yeah.
-Okay.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.695
-You didn't return my texts.
-My phone died.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.823
-I thought we were meeting at Curly's.
-Yeah, but I saw this place.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.909
Check out
the dead animal heads on the wall.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.285
Uh-huh, it's gross.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.788
Why don't we go to Curly's?

22:52.871 --> 22:55.582
Liz, chill out. I ordered fries.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.667
You know I hate it when you call me Liz.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.962
I know, but you're so adorable
when you're mad.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.139
-[Parker] Thanks, man.
-[Lizzie] Hey, Ricky. This is Parker.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.933
Parker, this is Ricky.

23:13.016 --> 23:15.644
Parker is a friend from LA
who decided to drop by

23:16.395 --> 23:17.479
unannounced.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.065
Hey.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.024
Hey.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.904
How do you two know each other?
You work at the bakery truck too?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.532
No. I'm Lizzie's boyfriend.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.160
Seriously?

23:32.744 --> 23:34.371
Yes, seriously.

23:35.038 --> 23:35.997
Oh.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.709
Good for you guys.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.798
Hey, man,
can you bring me a sparkling water?

23:46.466 --> 23:47.384
Sure.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.514
Dude, don't be an ass.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.850
I'm not. I'm genuinely thirsty.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.395
Unlike you, Ricky is sweet
and would do anything for me.

23:59.104 --> 23:59.938
Good.

24:00.730 --> 24:01.815
You deserve that.

24:02.858 --> 24:06.153
I know I didn't appreciate you
when I had the chance.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.529
Yeah, you blew it.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.031
I did, and now I wanna make amends.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.577
I'm over it. Apology accepted.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.703
Lizzie…

24:18.832 --> 24:20.709
I really wanna make things up to you.

24:32.471 --> 24:36.266
[Mel] I won't let you enter a flood zone
two days after a hurricane!

24:36.349 --> 24:38.518
It's a good thing
you're not in charge of me.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.021
Doesn't mean I don't care about
what happens to you.

24:41.104 --> 24:44.858
Look, I survived the Tet Offensive.
I think I can handle myself.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.318
That was a long time ago.

24:46.401 --> 24:50.113
Oh, so you think just because I'm old,
I must be weak, huh?

24:50.197 --> 24:53.116
No, no, this has nothing to do
with how old you are.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.160
Well, what does it have to do with?

24:55.243 --> 24:56.661
Your personal safety.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.207
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but I'm tougher than I look.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.374
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

25:01.458 --> 25:05.045
Uh-huh. When was the last time
you treaded water for 30 minutes

25:05.128 --> 25:07.297
or lifted a body over your head?

25:08.131 --> 25:09.174
Look… [sighs]

25:10.509 --> 25:11.968
…don't you understand?

25:13.053 --> 25:15.514
If Hope is trapped somewhere,

25:15.597 --> 25:18.558
and there's something
I could've done about it and I didn't,

25:18.642 --> 25:21.102
I will never forgive myself.

25:22.729 --> 25:23.980
Look, I know.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.358
But for all you know,
she could be perfectly safe,

25:26.441 --> 25:29.069
and you are going there risking your life.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.113
I'd rather take the risk

25:33.198 --> 25:34.991
than have to live with regret.

25:38.036 --> 25:38.912
Yeah.

25:47.045 --> 25:47.921
[Doc] I, um…

25:48.713 --> 25:51.299
-I promise you I will stay in touch.
-Okay.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.259
You better.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.191
[Lilly] I didn't want to interrupt.

26:08.900 --> 26:09.818
[Mel] Oh, Lilly.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.822
-I'm so glad you came by.
-I'm really sorry about today.

26:13.905 --> 26:17.242
No, no. I'm the one who's sorry.
I shouldn't have pushed you.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.744
I want to explain, okay? Um…

26:21.037 --> 26:25.000
The reason I don't want anyone to know
is I have some hard decisions to make,

26:25.083 --> 26:27.377
and I don't want
anyone second-guessing me.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.797
Have you been given treatment options?

26:30.880 --> 26:32.674
Yeah. The cancer is incurable,

26:32.757 --> 26:37.596
but the doctor's recommending
chemo and radiation therapy together

26:37.679 --> 26:39.889
to give me the best chance
of extending my life.

26:39.973 --> 26:43.184
And the problem with that
is the side effects.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.270
What about surgery?

26:45.353 --> 26:47.272
Yeah, it's also a possibility.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.149
What's the point

26:50.191 --> 26:52.777
of living a few months longer
if I can't function?

26:52.861 --> 26:53.778
[cell phone rings]

26:53.862 --> 26:55.947
-Could you hold her for a second?
-Of course.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.115
Here you go.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.617
Just, it might be Tara.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.619
[Lilly] Okay.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.621
Thank you. Hello?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.123
-Hello.
-[baby gurgles]

27:06.166 --> 27:08.418
-Yeah.
-[baby coos]

27:12.047 --> 27:13.089
Preach! Hey, Preacher!

27:13.173 --> 27:15.342
Whoa! Where's the fire, mister?

27:15.425 --> 27:17.719
-Guess what happened today.
-Well, let me see.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.221
You found buried treasure?

27:20.305 --> 27:24.809
Better. I got invited to a sleepover.
His name's Owen. He's the same age as me.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.186
It's his brother's birthday,

27:26.269 --> 27:28.563
but his parents
are letting him bring a friend,

27:28.647 --> 27:31.191
and he asked me.
I think I'm his new best friend.

27:31.274 --> 27:36.237
Hey, listen. I am so happy
that you and Owen are friends.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.741
I can't let you go to the sleepover.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.451
I don't know his family,

27:41.534 --> 27:43.620
and it's my responsibility
to keep you safe.

27:43.703 --> 27:47.332
You could talk to his mom on the phone.
Owen says she's super nice.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.335
Sorry, kiddo. The answer's no.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.337
-But why?
-Because, it's like I said.

27:52.420 --> 27:56.424
I don't know his family,
and it is just not the right time.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.219
But Owen will ask someone else,
and we won't be friends.

27:59.302 --> 28:01.888
-Hey, I am sure that's not true.
-You don't understand.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.723
-Christopher.
-I hate it here!

28:06.017 --> 28:07.268
[Preacher sighs]

28:08.311 --> 28:09.229
[door slams]

28:09.312 --> 28:10.438
You had no choice.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.440
Leave him be for now.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.358
Yeah.

28:14.651 --> 28:15.610
[chuckles]

28:16.736 --> 28:17.570
Thanks.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.954
-[baby gurgles]
-[Lilly] Oh. Hey.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.372
-Hey.
-Thank you.

28:27.455 --> 28:31.042
-She likes the trees.
-Oh, she sure does. Hey.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.336
You're so good with her.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.214
Aw. Comes with the midwife territory.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.133
-Everything okay?
-Oh, yeah.

28:38.216 --> 28:42.429
Just the usual battle
over which kind of milk to get. [sighs]

28:42.512 --> 28:44.347
Aw, she really likes you.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.851
-I like her too.
-Mm.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.939
I don't know if it's appropriate,
but I'm just gonna ask.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.442
Would you consider trying again?

28:56.401 --> 28:57.819
Oh gosh, um…

28:57.902 --> 29:01.239
You're still young. Come on.
You and Jack are wonderful together.

29:02.407 --> 29:06.661
Yeah, our relationship is so new,
and, I mean, he's having twins. It's--

29:06.745 --> 29:08.413
Those are reasons to say no.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.251
Unless it's something you really want.
[inhales]

29:15.462 --> 29:17.672
Yeah. I don't know.
I would love to have a baby,

29:17.756 --> 29:19.924
but I'm fine…
I'm fine if it doesn't happen.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.469
Doesn't sound like you're fine with it.

29:24.345 --> 29:28.224
I don't even know if I have a choice.
I don't even know if I can get pregnant.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.934
Honey, we all have choices.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.228
We may not like them.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.856
They may not look how we pictured them.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.901
But they're right in front of us.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.737
You just have to decide what's important.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.073
Anyway… [chuckles]

29:45.158 --> 29:46.159
Hmm.

29:46.701 --> 29:48.119
Sweet girl.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.120
[Mel] Hmm.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.677
-Where you been?
-Out.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.179
Uh-huh.

30:07.263 --> 30:08.097
Since yesterday?

30:08.890 --> 30:10.809
Aren't you always telling me
to lighten up?

30:10.892 --> 30:12.519
What's going on with you?

30:12.602 --> 30:14.854
Jack, I am not in the mood for a lecture.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.774
Hey, hey, I'm not lecturing you.
I care about you, okay?

30:17.857 --> 30:19.400
I wanna know what's going on.

30:22.987 --> 30:23.863
I…

30:24.906 --> 30:26.115
quit my job.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.075
[scoffs]

30:27.951 --> 30:28.868
Okay.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.166
You're serious?

30:35.250 --> 30:36.835
It's not that big of a deal.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.255
-But I thought you loved your job?
-Well, things changed.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.383
Okay.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.094
You'll get a new one.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.221
Yeah. It's not that simple.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.488
-I'll wait for you right here.
-Okay. Thanks.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.240
Hey, Jack.

31:07.323 --> 31:08.157
Hey.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.493
Hey, uh…

31:10.577 --> 31:11.661
Jack, right?

31:12.328 --> 31:13.329
Still Jack.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.083
You want me to send a server over?

31:17.166 --> 31:20.920
No, thanks. We just stopped in
so Char can use the ladies' room.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.048
-Hm.
-We're on our way back from McKinleyville.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.717
Hm, heck of a drive.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.053
-We spent the day with a pregnancy coach.
-Hm?

31:29.137 --> 31:32.599
I want Char to feel comfortable
with Lamaze when she goes into labor.

31:32.682 --> 31:33.683
Good idea.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.644
We talked about getting a doula
to assist Doc at the clinic.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.479
-You know, help her relax.
-Yeah.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.816
I don't think she's gonna
end up giving birth at the clinic.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.068
What are you talking about?

31:44.152 --> 31:46.738
I just think she should have the babies
at a hospital.

31:47.906 --> 31:52.535
That's what I've been saying all along.
I mean, the clinic was the compromise.

31:52.619 --> 31:56.080
I pretty much convinced her
to have them at St. Sebastian's in Eureka.

31:56.623 --> 32:01.127
My family is one of their biggest donors.
She'll have all the bells and whistles.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.754
-Nice.
-[Charmaine sighs]

32:02.837 --> 32:06.215
[chuckles] I just couldn't hold it
all the way to Clear River.

32:06.799 --> 32:09.636
Hey, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?

32:10.219 --> 32:11.638
Yeah, sure.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.014
Okay? Yeah.

32:22.690 --> 32:27.946
So, uh, Todd says you're having the twins
in a hospital in Eureka.

32:28.029 --> 32:31.991
Yeah, like three generations of his family
were born there.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.453
-So what about the birthing plan?
-What about it?

32:36.537 --> 32:38.665
You're just throwing that out the window?

32:39.666 --> 32:43.628
[sighs] Jack, I thought you wanted me
to deliver in a hospital?

32:43.711 --> 32:45.421
Yeah, I do. But…

32:46.130 --> 32:49.258
[scoffs] …it would've been nice
to have been consulted

32:49.342 --> 32:51.469
before you changed the plan, that's all.

32:51.552 --> 32:55.932
Okay, um, let's just remember
that I'm the one that's giving birth here.

32:56.599 --> 32:57.558
And, uh,

32:58.768 --> 32:59.811
I am the father.

33:01.104 --> 33:02.146
Okay? Not Todd.

33:02.230 --> 33:06.526
So, if you could just keep me in the loop,
I'd greatly appreciate it.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.613
Jack, this is good.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.490
How do you figure?

33:12.573 --> 33:18.162
I know that you were having a hard time
adjusting to the whole being a dad thing,

33:18.746 --> 33:20.373
but now Todd's here,

33:20.456 --> 33:21.874
and I'm not alone,

33:21.958 --> 33:24.585
so you're free to live your life.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.798
Charmaine, I think I made it clear
that I'm gonna be a hands-on father.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.302
Well, you're not
calling the shots anymore, okay?

33:33.386 --> 33:36.305
And you know what?
You should be thanking Todd for being here

33:36.389 --> 33:39.559
because if it wasn't for him,
the twins and I would be in Portland.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.061
What are you talking about?

33:42.145 --> 33:43.563
Mel didn't tell you?

33:44.981 --> 33:48.359
Huh! I mean,
I had asked her not to say anything,

33:48.443 --> 33:50.153
but I just figured she would.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.320
Before I met Todd,

33:51.404 --> 33:54.699
my aunt and uncle invited me
to go live with them in Portland.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.079
-Charmaine.
-I…

34:00.663 --> 34:01.956
I've gotta go. Okay?

34:02.040 --> 34:05.251
Can you just please--
Don't make this difficult.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.798
-You all right?
-It's okay. Yeah. It's fine.

34:13.634 --> 34:14.677
[door opens]

34:21.934 --> 34:23.061
[Muriel] Hi.

34:24.812 --> 34:25.646
How are you?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.357
You know, Muriel, I… [hesitates]

34:28.441 --> 34:31.569
I'm sorry,
but I'm not very good company right now.

34:32.779 --> 34:36.240
Well, actually, I'm here
on official sewing circle business.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.535
The girls and I wanted to do something
to help you and Hope,

34:39.619 --> 34:43.164
so we came up with a few things
to help make your trip easier.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.875
I'm sorry, I… I'm not following you.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.836
Connie has offered to house-sit.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.464
Nick and Jo Ellen
will drive you to the airport.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.008
I've arranged for a hotel room in Atlanta

34:54.092 --> 34:57.136
so you can sleep
before driving to Port Royal.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.722
And this is from Lilly.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.307
It's Buck's survival bag.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.559
She said anything you need is in here.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.686
[Muriel chuckling]

35:05.770 --> 35:09.690
What? How on earth did you all know
I was going to Port Royal?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.943
Lilly overheard you talking to Mel.

35:14.278 --> 35:18.783
I appreciate you for understanding,

35:20.701 --> 35:22.662
and what a wonderful friend you are.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.375
Vernon…

35:34.173 --> 35:35.883
you can always count on me.

35:37.802 --> 35:38.636
Thanks.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.750
Are you sure
you're up for driving back tonight?

36:09.834 --> 36:10.835
Yeah, I'm good.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.337
I got a pack of energy drinks
in the trunk.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.338
Cool.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.385
What?

36:20.553 --> 36:22.138
Nothing. Um…

36:22.221 --> 36:23.097
[Lizzie] Tell me.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.808
This isn't the right time to bring it up.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.727
Come on. You can't leave me hanging.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.480
I'm opening up a club in LA.

36:32.940 --> 36:33.858
Wow.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.277
Congrats.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.405
I want you to help me open the club.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.408
[Parker sighs] Come on.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.370
You don't belong here.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.625
And if you need a place to crash,
my dad's letting me use the beach house.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.876
Rent-free.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.045
Are you being serious right now?

36:54.128 --> 36:55.046
Totally.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.007
Move back to LA.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.887
I don't know what to say.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.431
Just say yes. [chuckles]

37:07.391 --> 37:08.601
Parker, I…

37:10.561 --> 37:12.313
I can't get into this right now.

37:13.481 --> 37:14.398
I've gotta go.

37:14.941 --> 37:15.775
[Parker] Hey.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.320
Is that a no?

37:20.780 --> 37:21.822
I'll think about it.

37:23.950 --> 37:24.867
All right.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.453
Just don't make me wait too long.

37:29.914 --> 37:30.748
[sighs]

37:32.917 --> 37:34.001
[car door opens]

37:34.877 --> 37:35.836
[car door closes]

37:35.920 --> 37:37.546
[motor starts]

37:49.350 --> 37:53.688
[cell phone ringing]

37:55.189 --> 37:56.899
Evening, son. How can I help you?

37:57.733 --> 38:01.404
Uh… I'm not sure yet. Uh--

38:01.487 --> 38:03.114
I'm Staff Sergeant Gomez.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.074
Ricky Sudder.

38:05.157 --> 38:07.618
I'm just… just looking for information.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.078
You thinking about enlisting?

38:09.161 --> 38:10.621
Yeah. Well, maybe.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.624
Well, why don't you follow me
so we can find out

38:13.708 --> 38:16.836
if you're a man worthy of wearing
a Marine Corps uniform? Come on.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.176
[Preacher] Wait until you see this.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.304
Okay, you ready?

38:26.387 --> 38:27.888
-Yeah.
-All right.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.642
A-ha. Yeah?

38:32.351 --> 38:34.895
-Whoa! Awesome!
-Check it out.

38:36.188 --> 38:39.608
[Preacher groans and sighs]

38:40.359 --> 38:41.861
[chuckles] Hey?

38:41.944 --> 38:42.778
What's that?

38:42.862 --> 38:45.865
Spookiest ghost stories ever.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.492
-Mua-ha-ha-ha!
-[Christopher giggles]

38:48.576 --> 38:50.411
[Preacher laughs]

38:50.494 --> 38:51.579
We're having s'mores?

38:51.662 --> 38:54.373
Oh yeah, you bet.
As soon as we get the fire started.

38:56.792 --> 38:57.877
Can we stay up late?

38:58.502 --> 38:59.545
Late as you want.

38:59.628 --> 39:02.715
-Can we go fishing in the morning?
-Well, I don't see why not.

39:02.798 --> 39:04.050
[chuckling]

39:05.051 --> 39:06.135
[Preacher sighs]

39:08.387 --> 39:09.388
Hey, listen, buddy.

39:10.514 --> 39:14.685
You know, I'm sorry
I couldn't let you go to that sleepover.

39:14.769 --> 39:18.439
But your mom asked me to keep you safe.
I care about you.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.108
-So that is what I'm gonna do.
-[sighs]

39:22.902 --> 39:26.989
It's just everyone thinks I'm weird,
except for Owen.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.159
I don't think you're weird.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.496
-Connie doesn't think you're weird.
-That doesn't count.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.874
You guys are grown-ups.
You have to be nice to me.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.502
I'm nice to you because I like you.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.337
You're a cool kid.

39:41.962 --> 39:45.633
And if the other kids can't see that,
well, that is their loss.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.677
[Preacher inhales sharply] Hm.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.347
You know what?

39:52.431 --> 39:53.933
I don't actually hate it here.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.060
Yeah, I know.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.603
[Preacher chuckles]

39:58.521 --> 39:59.438
Hmm.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.776
-Thanks for the campout, Preach.
-You're welcome.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.987
So, you wanna help me
get that fire started?

40:07.071 --> 40:08.656
-[laughs] Heck yeah.
-Yeah? Good.

40:08.739 --> 40:12.868
You get the crackers, chocolate.
I'll get the marshmallows.

40:24.630 --> 40:25.464
Lilly?

40:26.340 --> 40:28.676
-What are you doing here?
-It's Hope.

40:29.635 --> 40:32.179
She's on the phone.
She couldn't reach you.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.307
Hello!

40:37.017 --> 40:37.935
Hello?

40:39.437 --> 40:40.438
Can you hear me?

40:41.564 --> 40:42.898
Yeah, nice.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.276
Nice and golden brown.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.112
-Gonna put mine in there.
-I'll cross mine on.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.364
There we go. Let's see. There we go.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.158
-You took my fire.
-I took your flame.

40:54.076 --> 40:54.910
[both] Oh.

40:54.994 --> 40:58.789
-Oh, there we go. Look at that.
-Burnt to the core. Now, that's a s'more.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.126
-That one's perfect.
-That's good.

41:02.209 --> 41:03.752
I want that. Can I get that?

41:07.131 --> 41:08.132
[Jack] Hey.

41:08.924 --> 41:09.758
[Mel] Hey.

41:12.428 --> 41:16.515
I saw Preacher and Christopher's campout,
and I got inspired.

41:20.269 --> 41:21.187
Here you go.

41:21.270 --> 41:22.646
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

41:27.693 --> 41:29.195
How was the rest of your day?

41:30.070 --> 41:31.530
A little unexpected.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.825
Did something happen?

41:38.370 --> 41:41.165
Did Charmaine tell you
she was planning on moving to Oregon?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.542
[sighs heavily]

41:43.626 --> 41:44.543
Yeah.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.255
Yeah, she told me
that she was thinking about it.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.465
Why didn't you tell me?

41:49.548 --> 41:51.050
You were in the hospital,

41:51.133 --> 41:54.178
and the only thing I was focused on
at the time was you.

41:54.261 --> 41:55.679
And after I was released?

41:55.763 --> 41:58.599
I didn't wanna upset you
while you were recovering.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.351
And after that?

42:00.434 --> 42:04.104
After that, you told me that Charmaine
was gonna live with Todd in Clear River,

42:04.188 --> 42:05.814
so it just seemed like a non-issue.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.526
Yeah, but let's just say she had moved.

42:08.609 --> 42:11.070
I would've been completely blindsided.

42:11.153 --> 42:13.864
But she didn't move,
and so, if I had told you,

42:13.948 --> 42:16.367
then you would've been upset
for no reason.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.538
Is that what you would've wanted?

42:21.539 --> 42:22.456
Yes.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.210
Oh.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.255
I will always wanna know the truth,

42:30.673 --> 42:32.841
whether you think
it's gonna upset me or not.

42:35.427 --> 42:37.346
Jack, I'm really sorry.

42:37.429 --> 42:38.973
No. It's okay. I mean…

42:40.975 --> 42:42.685
it was a bit of a shock. [scoffs]

42:50.359 --> 42:51.360
Are we okay?

42:52.528 --> 42:53.362
Yeah.

42:55.447 --> 42:56.740
100%.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.039
So are we gonna have a real campout?

43:04.123 --> 43:07.334
[laughs] What is a real campout?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.003
Sleeping under the stars.

43:09.086 --> 43:12.881
A-ha, see, I have
a no-sleeping-on-the-ground policy.

43:12.965 --> 43:15.301
What, even on a night as gorgeous as this?

43:15.384 --> 43:20.973
I ask you, why would I sleep outside

43:21.056 --> 43:24.018
when I can just enjoy the view
and then sleep in my own bed?

43:25.269 --> 43:29.940
The faint sound of the river
lulling us to sleep.

43:30.024 --> 43:30.899
[Mel] Hmm.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.487
Our bodies keeping each other warm.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.489
Oh, okay.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.368
I… I think I can do that.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.829
-Maybe?
-Maybe.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.373
[Jack] Mm.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.210
[phone ringing]

43:50.961 --> 43:52.212
[sighs]

43:54.590 --> 43:55.674
Sorry, I gotta…

43:56.175 --> 43:57.343
That's okay.

43:58.510 --> 43:59.762
Hey, Mike, what's up?

44:01.764 --> 44:03.766
[tense music playing]

44:08.937 --> 44:09.855
Got it.

44:11.815 --> 44:14.193
-What is it?
-They got him.

44:14.902 --> 44:16.153
Jimmy's in custody.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.740
[sighs heavily]

44:23.535 --> 44:25.454
[theme music playing]
