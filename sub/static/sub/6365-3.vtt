00:00.001 --> 00:03.736
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Catherine:
<i>For god's sake, go to him.</i>

00:03.738 --> 00:05.137
<i>Is the king all right?</i>

00:05.139 --> 00:08.040
Guard:
<i>The king is dead!</i>

00:08.042 --> 00:11.443
I remember holding you in my
arms when you were this little.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.445
Who are you talking to?

00:13.447 --> 00:16.382
Don't you recognize
your own father?

00:16.384 --> 00:17.449
What did you just say?

00:17.451 --> 00:19.385
Did I say something, your grace?

00:19.387 --> 00:21.153
As a royal, you're given
your position by birth,

00:21.155 --> 00:22.388
Or marriage,

00:22.390 --> 00:24.456
But your power
comes from nobles.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.359
Eduard:
Villagers are burning the homes
<i>of the infected.</i>

00:27.361 --> 00:29.495
Those are the holdings
you were counting on.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.564
<i>I think you know</i>
<i>who was really responsible</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:34.333
<i>For your son's death.</i>

00:34.335 --> 00:38.604
You are. And you will learn
never to cross me again.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.548
(horses neighing)

00:49.550 --> 00:53.419
Catherine:
A banquet for 1,200,

00:53.421 --> 00:57.156
A military parade
all with new uniforms

00:57.158 --> 01:01.060
Featuring blood red
satin sashes of my own design.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.628
Now, as for entertainment,

01:02.630 --> 01:04.797
Dancing elephants
were proposed.

01:04.799 --> 01:06.565
I thought that was
a bit excessive.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.569
We went with a
golden-horned unicorn.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.805
What? You look
displeased.

01:12.807 --> 01:14.773
We just came through a plague

01:14.775 --> 01:17.076
That decimated
the region's populace.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.477
Famine follow plague,

01:18.479 --> 01:19.778
And people are dying
of starvation every day.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.414
We spent a fortune
on father's funeral.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.615
We have massive war debts
from father's campaign,

01:23.617 --> 01:26.285
Much of it owed to our guests.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.653
Hmm, so you're saying my
preparation for your coronation

01:27.655 --> 01:29.421
Is in poor taste?
No, I'm only saying...

01:29.423 --> 01:31.123
It's not just
poor taste.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.624
It's grotesque,

01:32.626 --> 01:34.359
Unaffordable
and shameful.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.662
Excellent.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.664
That's precisely the
effect I was aiming for.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.799
Your coronation is not
about affordability.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.734
It's about survival.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.837
Leaders from 50 countries
will be here this week,

01:44.839 --> 01:46.605
Staying in those pavilions.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.807
They are lions,

01:48.809 --> 01:51.610
Studying our every move
for signs of weakness.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.680
If we economize, if we dither
about expenses in any way,

01:54.682 --> 01:57.116
We look like the wounded gazelle
we truly are,

01:57.118 --> 01:59.685
Begging our foes to
align with our enemies,

01:59.687 --> 02:02.454
Test our borders,
challenge our interests.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.290
From there, it is a short slide

02:05.292 --> 02:08.260
To our severed heads
riding on pikes.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.461
What good does it do us
to pretend

02:09.463 --> 02:11.597
To be strong if it bankrupts us?

02:11.599 --> 02:13.532
Truly, francis, I don't know why

02:13.534 --> 02:15.434
She's even in this conversation.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.536
Didn't you promise the
nobles you'd muzzle her?

02:17.538 --> 02:21.406
Muzzle?
That is what you told
lord narcisse.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.575
The man controls 90%
of the grain in the region.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.244
In a famine,
that is not just wealth.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.645
That is power.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.247
What grain?

02:28.249 --> 02:30.215
Lord narcisse has delivered
nothing but excuses.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.550
A new one every day.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.485
I imagine he might've
be more cooperative

02:33.487 --> 02:34.753
Had you not murdered his son.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.922
What I did was justice,
not murder.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.624
All right, the both of you,
enough.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.592
Mary understands that
she needs to take a step back

02:40.594 --> 02:42.594
Until after the coronation.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.929
Mary understands?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.631
Doesn't look that way to me.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.599
Mary willingly played along
to fool narcisse.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.302
She will continue
to "know her place"

02:50.304 --> 02:51.603
Until we have
gotten his grain.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.638
And if he offers nothing
but more delays,

02:52.640 --> 02:54.573
I have another plan.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.342
I'm negotiating with young
lord ducasse for his harvest.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.311
You've been busy.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.446
And behind narcisse's back.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.714
He won't like it.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.616
Lions study our every move.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.752
What better time than
my coronation to show them

03:06.754 --> 03:08.487
That we can feed our own people?

03:08.489 --> 03:10.556
One way or another,
that is what I'll do.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.723
Mary?

03:17.764 --> 03:19.965
Francis, I understand
you need me to play the part.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.900
The pretense will help
keep narcisse quiet

03:21.902 --> 03:23.569
And give us a better
chance at his grain.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.270
And it won't hurt
to show the nobles,

03:25.272 --> 03:27.839
Many twice my age, that if
you obey me, they can, too.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.509
Are all powerful men
so insecure?

03:30.511 --> 03:31.677
A few.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.779
Many.

03:33.781 --> 03:34.980
Most.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.815
Summoner:
Quiet outside.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.750
I need quiet.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.385
The dead do not shout.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.254
I cannot tell you their words

03:42.256 --> 03:42.588
If I cannot hear them.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.829
Is there some spirit
you're expecting to hear from?

03:50.831 --> 03:53.265
Francis?

03:53.267 --> 03:54.433
Is anything wrong?

03:54.435 --> 03:56.001
Nothing.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.837
I must find lord ducasse to
discuss our deal for his grain.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.672
He promised me
an answer soon.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.776
Coronation day.
A new king.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.679
And the king's child
publicly claimed.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.915
Land and title both.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.516
You must be so happy.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.685
I suppose I must be.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.320
Will you visit your summer
home before the chill?

04:15.322 --> 04:16.688
Hope to.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.690
It's beautiful this
time of year.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.726
Lady lola will visit
her new chÃ¢teau, of course.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.929
The little baron will
be so happy there.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.531
Lady kenna, what about you?

04:26.533 --> 04:27.933
Poor thing--
lost her home in one of those

04:27.935 --> 04:29.935
Horrid plague fires.
That's no fun, is it?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.803
Not really, no.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.772
I did not think I'd ever
wear a gown again.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.308
Three days until
the coronation,

04:36.310 --> 04:37.609
And a dress for
every occasion.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.582
It's not fair.
Where's our new chÃ¢teau?

04:43.584 --> 04:45.784
You are the king's deputy.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.986
I love lola like a sister,
but the idea that unnamed baby

04:47.988 --> 04:50.822
Has been granted vast holdings.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.990
Since when was there
any land available?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.425
There isn't.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.993
Not within two days'
ride of the job

04:54.995 --> 04:56.795
You begged me
to take at the castle.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.597
Yes, but don't forget the title
that comes with it.

04:58.599 --> 05:02.034
Do you know what a title like
that would've meant to me?

05:02.036 --> 05:04.569
Baron sebastian instead
of bastard sebastian?

05:04.571 --> 05:06.772
In other words, we cannot
begrudge lola and her child

05:06.774 --> 05:08.774
Any gifts they may receive,
if it makes life easier

05:08.776 --> 05:10.909
For them than it was
for you and your mother.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.344
In those words exactly.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.779
Still,

05:13.781 --> 05:15.981
What does a baby need with
all that land anyway?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.684
When do we get what
we deserve? Hmm?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.652
Is that?
It is.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.787
The prince of conde.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.921
Here for the coronation.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.423
We should make him welcome.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.525
Hello.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.897
Louis, I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.965
This is my new friend.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.500
We only just met.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.803
(quietly): Why don't you wait
for me at my pavilion.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.838
I'll be there in a moment.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.506
Majesty. Greer.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.942
Have you come here
to make me feel welcome?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.944
I believe you've quite
managed that on your own.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.679
Is that judgment in your tone?

05:47.681 --> 05:48.980
Mary:
Uh, I'm sure she intends

05:48.982 --> 05:50.782
Only admiration.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.685
You've moved on quite adroitly
from your lady friend

05:53.687 --> 05:54.853
After she shipped off
to amsterdam.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.121
What was her name again?

05:56.123 --> 05:57.689
Lady doutzen, I think.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.791
So much admiration
from you both.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.827
I think it's more
than I can bear.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.029
Majesty.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.831
She's a courtesan.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.399
I know.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.900
Did you notice her eyes?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.936
One was blue and the
other was green.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.938
It's a shame about lord conde.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.374
I thought he might make
a suitable match for lola.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.943
He's pleasant enough to look at,
but I think lola prefers a man

06:17.945 --> 06:20.011
Who doesn't measure love
by the hour.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.548
Lola:
Francis.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.884
You're the king,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.120
So I suppose you can dismiss
people as you please,

06:28.122 --> 06:30.889
But I wish when it's one of our
nannies you'd consult me first.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.924
Caroline was my favorite.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.593
Such a gentle touch
with the baby.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.395
I'm sorry, but when
I visited the nursery,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.029
I found the baby alone.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.798
Caroline was nowhere
in sight.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.400
That doesn't sound
like her.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.435
She's devoted to the child.
Lola, forgive me,

06:43.437 --> 06:45.036
I don't have time to discuss
household arrangements.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.973
But...
Later. Please.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.077
Did you talk to lord ducasse
about his grain?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.679
No. He postponed his arrival
until tonight.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.914
Narcisse:
Your majesty.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.082
Lord narcisse.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.585
I didn't hear back from you
and expected an answer.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.187
I had no idea. About what?

07:02.189 --> 07:05.724
My grain, really, if your
promise is still good.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.426
Yes, well, that's a sad story.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.594
Still?
Hmm.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.129
A workforce decimated
by the plague.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.132
And those who can work,
forever making excuses not to.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.834
They're too hungry
to work.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.169
Too sad from the loss
of their families and friends.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.938
It's pitiful, really.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.140
So many different words

07:22.142 --> 07:24.142
To describe simple laziness.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.845
I'm sorry to hear it.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.080
France is starving, and surely
we all feel a duty

07:29.082 --> 07:31.516
To help make the suffering end.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.918
Can you give me a date,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.086
A specific date, when I can
expect the first shipment?

07:35.088 --> 07:37.722
Soon, your majesty.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.057
Very soon.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.630
How dare he?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.732
He calls men lazy
while they starve?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.034
While they grieve?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.635
Take his land
and be done with it.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.604
And in taking it, I would anger
every french nobleman

07:52.606 --> 07:53.905
Two days before they gather here

07:53.907 --> 07:55.474
To help put the crown
on my head.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.576
Mother was right
about one thing.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.110
Narcisse wants revenge
for his son's death,

07:59.112 --> 08:01.079
And withholding grain
is how he's getting it.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.982
Please tell me you're going
to hear from ducasse soon.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.084
We can't wait for
help much longer.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.188
Stop him! Stop!
Stop the thief!

08:10.190 --> 08:11.957
Thief!
Stop this man!

08:11.959 --> 08:13.492
Thief! Don't let
him get away!

08:13.494 --> 08:15.994
Stop! Stop him!
Stop that man!

08:17.697 --> 08:19.598
(grunts)

08:28.174 --> 08:29.541
(gasps)

08:37.650 --> 08:40.685
(chickens clucking,
crowd murmuring)

08:40.687 --> 08:43.722
He was just trying
to feed his family.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.663
We can't wait.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.671
â™ª

08:59.673 --> 09:02.173
(excited chattering)

09:08.748 --> 09:11.283
I can't stop thinking
about that poor man.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.685
The guards thought
he attacked that noblewoman.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.886
They were wrong, but...

09:14.888 --> 09:16.555
He didn't deserve to die.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.857
Not for a chicken
and some bread.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.325
Your majesties?

09:20.327 --> 09:22.060
Lord ducasse.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.695
The title still
seems strange to me.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.697
But given with good reason.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.232
You served my father well
at the southern border.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.333
Your majesties,

09:28.335 --> 09:30.135
Allow me to present
my wife monique,

09:30.137 --> 09:32.003
My son guy.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.238
And how old are you, guy?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.005
Six, ma'am.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.074
Your majesty.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.742
"ma'am" is fine.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.245
Your grain is ready
for shipment?

09:40.247 --> 09:42.047
Yes. All prepared.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.884
It's just...

09:45.886 --> 09:48.653
What's wrong?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.055
Was my offer not fair?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.289
Very fair, majesty.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.326
But... There's a reason
other nobles

09:54.328 --> 09:56.061
Make excuses when asked
for their grain.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.298
Lord narcisse.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.601
Ducasse:
I'm recently titled,

10:02.603 --> 10:04.069
But not so recent

10:04.071 --> 10:07.906
He has brought down far more
powerful men than me.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.274
I am king.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.142
You have nothing to fear
from narcisse or anyone else.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.847
(laughter)

10:15.849 --> 10:18.083
Did you find out
what I asked?

10:18.085 --> 10:21.086
Lord montgomery left court
after he was pardoned

10:21.088 --> 10:23.121
For killing our father
at the joust.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.657
Found work as a habsburg
mercenary in bohemia,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.192
And hasn't been back since.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.794
And the list I gave you?
There's no connection

10:29.796 --> 10:31.630
Between him
and anyone on it.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.999
I believe lola's nanny,
caroline, was listed.

10:34.001 --> 10:37.335
Yes, but she arrived
after montgomery left.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.770
Why would montgomery
have anything

10:38.772 --> 10:40.205
To do with lola's nanny?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.806
What are you after?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.109
I asked you to handle
this because I trust you.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.212
I trust you not to ask
questions I can't answer.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.385
(crowd chatter)

10:54.987 --> 10:57.856
â™ª

11:05.097 --> 11:06.865
Your majesty.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.667
Herr schuler, welcome.

11:08.669 --> 11:09.834
We're so glad to have you.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.436
We know that
you're a long way from home.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.104
I know that there has been

11:13.106 --> 11:14.773
Some bad blood
between protestant germany

11:14.775 --> 11:15.974
And catholic France.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.709
Francis does not want
to continue

11:17.711 --> 11:19.144
The old battles.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.845
Give us the chance
to prove it to you.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.381
Here is your chance.
I seek the release

11:23.383 --> 11:25.884
Of protestant prisoners
jailed by king henry.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.819
Men whose only
crime was to make

11:27.821 --> 11:30.321
A new relationship
with god, as I do.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.424
I knew nothing of this.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.159
Then release them.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.027
What better way
to herald a new era?

11:36.029 --> 11:39.364
France is sick
with famine.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.733
I come from a region
rich in german grain.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.703
If the new king will release
the prisoners to me,

11:44.705 --> 11:46.471
I will give him
the grain he needs.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.976
(crowd chatter)

11:58.350 --> 12:01.186
Help me, please,
I beg you.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.755
You're the king's deputy,
my last resort.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.323
My husband was murdered.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.859
No one believes me,
but it's true.

12:07.861 --> 12:11.262
My husband is dead, and I cannot
find him, and he did it.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.797
Who did it?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.766
Lord barnard!

12:14.768 --> 12:17.502
He thinks he can kill any man
and get away with it!

12:17.504 --> 12:19.771
Come with me.

12:24.276 --> 12:26.411
Narcisse:
It must be hard.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.381
Once a queen,
now queen mother.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.817
Decorative like an
expensive vase,

12:32.819 --> 12:34.953
And not a great
deal more relevant.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.155
I'm not the only one.

12:37.157 --> 12:41.025
There's a new day coming,
and you are on the wrong side.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.327
Am I? Hmm?

12:42.329 --> 12:46.431
Francis and mary see
the world differently.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.533
They are moral.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.035
They care about the people.

12:51.037 --> 12:55.006
More than they care about money
or power... Or men like you.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.841
Time will teach

12:56.843 --> 12:59.377
Francis to think
like his father.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.312
I wonder about that.

13:01.314 --> 13:05.116
But you didn't come here
to discuss the future, did you?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.986
Francis double-deals
behind my back.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.288
Reaching out to other
french nobles for grain.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.090
Despite the long-term
relationship

13:12.092 --> 13:13.424
I have with the crown.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.226
Is that the relationship

13:15.228 --> 13:17.462
Where you promise vital goods
that never arrive?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.997
They might arrive

13:18.999 --> 13:21.900
Faster if your husband's
debts to me were repaid.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.002
Don't pretend
this is about money.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.571
You have all the money you need.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.006
You want power.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.909
You want revenge.

13:30.911 --> 13:34.312
But how could I possibly
help you?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.481
I'm irrelevant.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.254
Lady kenna?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.525
Have we met?
In the tent city.

13:47.527 --> 13:51.095
Noble wives bragging about their
summer homes at your expense.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.832
They are preening pea hens
with empty heads.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.567
Are they not your friends?

13:55.569 --> 13:57.569
I prefer friends
with more between their ears

13:57.571 --> 14:00.004
Than chiffon
and puff pastry, don't you?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.173
I prefer friends I can trust.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.842
Especially now, I imagine,

14:03.844 --> 14:05.476
With your husband's position
so sensitive.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.446
Is any man closer to the king?

14:08.448 --> 14:12.183
I can't imagine all the gifts
and tribute you must receive.

14:12.185 --> 14:16.221
Every noble eager to curry favor
with an important man like that.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.089
No gifts, no land.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.891
No tributes of any kind,
actually.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.860
Must be doing something wrong.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.529
Nobles are like geese.
They fly in flocks.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.465
If one does something,
the others will follow.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.202
But perhaps I can help.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.271
How?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.139
My husband is helping
dispose of estates

14:35.141 --> 14:37.075
Left without owners
after the plague.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.143
Some are rather expansive.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.279
Unless you'd rather avoid the
bother of managing property.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.916
No, not at all. That...
That sounds lovely, actually.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.618
Oh.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.255
I spoke to the german duke,
schuler.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.257
The dour protestant?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.559
He didn't just come here
for the coronation.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.895
He came to make a deal.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.429
He has grain.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.964
What kind of deal?

14:59.966 --> 15:01.566
The protestant prisoners
your father jailed.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.302
He offers grain in exchange
for their freedom.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.905
It's a good deal,

15:06.907 --> 15:09.173
And one that you're
in dire need of.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.543
And german dukes aren't afraid
of lord narcisse.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.245
Asking you
to know your place

15:14.247 --> 15:16.514
Is like asking the sun
not to shine.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.651
I know it's not part of the
plan, but schuler approached me.

15:19.653 --> 15:22.487
If only it weren't a solution
that made more problems.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.589
A deal with a protestant duke

15:24.591 --> 15:26.391
Would anger every
catholic noble.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.559
This is not the week
for that.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.229
Lord ducasse's grain
will put an end to the crisis.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.665
Your majesty?
We found the nanny.

15:33.667 --> 15:34.933
She took a room
in the village.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.701
Thank you.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.073
You're looking
for a nanny?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.574
One of lola's?

15:43.576 --> 15:45.677
I dismissed her, but lola wants

15:45.679 --> 15:47.578
To pay the woman
the money she's owed.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.547
Oh.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.549
(crickets chirping)

15:51.551 --> 15:54.352
Please explain to me
why my son disappears,

15:54.354 --> 15:57.021
And then your man comes to
my suite to invite me here.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.589
Where is he?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.425
Guy:
Papa!

16:00.427 --> 16:03.428
I found your boy playing alone
in a castle corridor.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.464
He should have been asleep,
but he's safe with me.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.266
Guy:
It's cold out here.
Can I come in now?

16:08.268 --> 16:09.667
Man:
Not now.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.170
Look at the stars.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.742
I know what it's like
to lose a son.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.677
I lost my son,

16:19.679 --> 16:22.547
My heir, during the plague.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.316
I feel his absence

16:25.318 --> 16:28.519
Every minute
of every day.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.556
I hope you never feel
pain like that.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.291
It would destroy you.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.364
(gasping)

16:39.366 --> 16:42.700
(crying)

16:49.608 --> 16:51.609
But what happened? Why did
ducasse change his mind?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.011
He didn't give a reason,
but he suddenly claims

16:53.013 --> 16:54.779
Not to have the grain
that he promised.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.549
Narcisse is behind this.
He may well be, but it
makes no difference.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.586
There's no deal.
But there is.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.322
With schuler, the german duke.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.424
He offered to exchange grain
for the protestant prisoners.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.260
I can't release prisoners
without knowing their crimes.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.729
They might be dangerous
men or usurpers.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.464
There's too many
protestants determined

17:13.466 --> 17:15.433
To put one of their
own on my throne.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.770
Until I find out, keep
the german duke in place.

17:18.772 --> 17:20.438
Two days until the coronation.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.507
Then schuler will leave court
and go home.

17:22.509 --> 17:27.145
Tell that to the people
starving outside our walls.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.546
I heard the news.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.482
Your grace.
Young lord ducasse's

17:31.484 --> 17:34.652
Sudden desire
to keep his grain for himself.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.621
It's funny how that worked out.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.122
Yes.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.490
You want
to teach my son a lesson

17:39.492 --> 17:41.492
About who holds
the power in France.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.494
The lesson is this.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.364
You will pay
for my son's death.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.833
You can't put a price
on such a loss,

17:48.835 --> 17:52.503
But your son needn't
have died in vain.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.639
You need a friend
at court.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.673
You?
Mm.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.508
What do you want?

17:57.510 --> 18:00.611
Grain... Sold to me
if you won't sell it to francis.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.280
Corn if you have it.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.850
And in exchange, you
will convince francis

18:05.852 --> 18:09.187
To put my friend lord robuchon
on his privy council.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.688
I won't corrupt
my son's council.

18:10.690 --> 18:14.092
I'm here to make francis a
stronger king, not a weaker one.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.662
An advisor of my choice, or
regrettably, there is no deal.

18:17.664 --> 18:21.099
I shall get my grain
elsewhere.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.669
You didn't come here
because your heart bleeds

18:24.671 --> 18:26.637
For your starving
countrymen.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.106
What are you hiding?

18:28.108 --> 18:30.608
Well, perhaps
I'm hiding a bleeding heart.

18:35.714 --> 18:39.550
Your majesty?
The meeting is arranged.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.653
We can escort you to the tent
city when you have the time.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.723
Now. Let's go now.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.393
Mary:
Herr schuler!

18:49.395 --> 18:52.330
Good news about the exchange
we discussed last night.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.598
I'm listening.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.334
The king is intrigued
by the prospect,

18:56.336 --> 18:58.603
But more so by
the new alliance it ratifies.

18:58.605 --> 19:02.406
The king is intrigued?
He needs time to consider?

19:02.408 --> 19:05.243
Yes, but...
Maybe I should have
spoken to the king.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.879
You may deal with me directly.

19:07.881 --> 19:12.817
Very well. I'm telling you
that I'm going home. Now.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.852
If peace is a thing
you need to <i>consider,</i>

19:14.854 --> 19:18.322
I have no interest
in dealing with you or the king.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.657
My husband simply wants
to confirm

19:19.659 --> 19:21.359
What the men were
imprisoned for.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.661
The word of a german duke
is not enough?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.396
I told you.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.899
My friends were jailed
for their faith, nothing more.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.668
The coronation is in
just a few days. If...

19:30.670 --> 19:32.436
I came here to free my friends.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.439
I didn't come to watch rome
prop up a new puppet king.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.580
(horse neighing)

19:42.582 --> 19:43.848
Your majesty, it is a great

19:43.850 --> 19:45.917
And unexpected honor
to sit with you.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.219
I have little time,
and none of it for flattery.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.820
What can I do for you?

19:49.822 --> 19:52.723
I'm told
that you speak with the dead.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.759
There is much
to learn from them.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.428
I suppose that might be true
if I thought it were possible.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.797
Then why are you here?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.667
There's a woman
I want you to meet.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.202
She acts

20:04.204 --> 20:05.770
As if she is possessed.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.472
I want you to tell me if
she is deceiving me on purpose,

20:08.474 --> 20:10.608
Or if she is in the grip
of some madness.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.776
But what if it's neither?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.745
What if her possession
is real?

20:14.747 --> 20:16.814
I don't believe in ghosts.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.217
Mm.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.219
Undertaker's apprentice.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.221
He was a good
man, your master?
Yes,

20:23.223 --> 20:25.423
My lord.
And the dead are listed here?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.958
Them that was removed
from the pit.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.961
"unknown woman, died of plague.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.663
Unknown child, plague."

20:32.665 --> 20:35.466
Are you familiar
with lord doisneau?

20:35.468 --> 20:36.667
Do you know the name?

20:36.669 --> 20:39.303
Lord barnard?

20:42.574 --> 20:43.808
Boy. You are
under my protection.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.276
Do you understand?

20:45.278 --> 20:46.911
Tell me what
you know.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.947
Lord doisneau was
kind to everyone.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.749
And barnard?

20:51.751 --> 20:54.252
No one's good enough for him.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.788
There's rumors he wants the coal
under lord doisneau's land.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.491
His wife insists he's dead, but

21:00.493 --> 21:02.860
The name "doisneau"
isn't in here.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.362
Wait.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.963
Lady doisneau said

21:05.965 --> 21:07.965
They were
recently titled.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.269
And if they were given title,
they were given name.

21:12.571 --> 21:13.838
There it is.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.872
Doisneau's patronym.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.007
My lord?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.441
The name he was born with.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.510
Bouchard.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.849
It's here.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.752
His throat was slit.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.687
Greer:
You're going to do this
before we find francis?

21:29.689 --> 21:31.422
Mary. Are you sure?

21:31.424 --> 21:32.923
A villager killed
his neighbor this morning

21:32.925 --> 21:35.026
Fighting over
a rancid potato.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.728
People are starving and dying,
and there will be more.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.598
Didn't francis say he wanted
to rule on the bargain himself?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
He wants his people to eat.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.901
I'll do what I have to
to feed them.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.536
Can't it wait till we find him?

21:45.538 --> 21:48.005
We've been looking
for him everywhere.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.907
The germans are packing
to leave as we speak.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.643
They hold the only grain
we can get on short notice.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.811
We're out of other options.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.615
Herr schuler.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.017
Thank you for your hospitality,
but we are leaving now.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.787
The kingsguard
have been ordered

22:02.789 --> 22:05.089
To accompany you
and your men to the garrison

22:05.091 --> 22:07.358
Where the protestant
prisoners are being held.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.026
It's a short ride.
Once there,

22:09.028 --> 22:11.796
They will be handed over
into your custody, as agreed.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.864
This is good news, your grace.

22:13.866 --> 22:17.335
I'm surprised... Pleased
that the king has agreed...

22:17.337 --> 22:19.003
You'll have your prisoners.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.738
And you will have your grain.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.840
France thanks you.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.642
And my husband the king
thanks you.

22:27.813 --> 22:31.382
I still don't understand
what I'm doing here.

22:31.384 --> 22:34.418
I don't remember any of
what the king talked about.

22:34.420 --> 22:37.355
There's nothing to fear.
I will guide you.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.857
Just relax your mind.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.859
This mesmeric elixir,

22:41.861 --> 22:43.794
The rarest metals reduced,

22:43.796 --> 22:45.563
Summons spirits

22:45.565 --> 22:46.864
Of the dead.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.900
Which you may host.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.969
Your grace,

22:51.971 --> 22:53.871
Please understand
there's no guarantee that...

22:53.873 --> 22:56.006
Weakness is a fatal flaw
in a king.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.843
Leave us. Now.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.911
Go.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.552
Is it you?

23:12.991 --> 23:14.125
What's your name?

23:14.127 --> 23:15.159
I'm henry.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.594
Where were you born?

23:16.596 --> 23:17.962
ChÃ¢teau
de saint-germain-en-laye.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.597
That's a funny

23:19.599 --> 23:20.798
Question.
And your father-- where was...

23:20.800 --> 23:22.967
He died on my birthday.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.771
28 candles on my
birthday cake.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.172
I died, too.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.874
I don't want to talk about that.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.476
But I did not
rise up afterwards.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.879
Something seems to hold me.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.447
Why am I here?

23:36.449 --> 23:37.982
What holds me?

23:37.984 --> 23:39.984
Perhaps your sins.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.652
I don't remember them.

23:41.654 --> 23:42.920
They were many.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.822
But I remember my death.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.091
I feel the horse
beneath me--

23:47.093 --> 23:49.994
A joust and I
cannot lose.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.862
Montgomery rides against me,

23:51.864 --> 23:53.798
But he never rode like that--

23:53.800 --> 23:56.467
The way he held
the lance,

23:56.469 --> 23:59.470
Aimed at my head
and not my shield.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.005
I should've seen it.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.973
I should've
known.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.742
It was not
montgomery,

24:04.744 --> 24:06.043
It was some other man.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.813
Oh, my god. It's you.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.481
You changed.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.550
I saw it
before I died.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.084
The way you looked at me.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.719
Plots and plans

24:15.721 --> 24:18.489
And plots
and plans.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.557
Could you?

24:19.559 --> 24:20.925
Would you dare

24:20.927 --> 24:22.126
Raise a hand
against your...

24:22.128 --> 24:24.094
Stop. Please.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.030
Leave me alone.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.808
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.510
Mary, please, not
now. I need sleep.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.846
It's about the german duke.
Francis, I ordered the

24:41.848 --> 24:44.515
King's guards to accompany
him to the garrison

24:44.517 --> 24:45.749
To free the
protestant prisoners.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.751
Without consulting me? Why?

24:47.753 --> 24:49.253
We had an agreement.
There was no time.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.155
Two days was
more than enough time.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.656
I told you I would look into it.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.691
Schuler was leaving court

24:53.693 --> 24:54.692
And I couldn't find you.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.227
Mary, I warned you.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.829
Provoking french noblemen,
taking on narcisse.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.499
Hours before my coronation.
He offered a fair deal.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.501
The only deal that
could keep France

25:03.503 --> 25:06.504
From the famine. German
grain. A new alliance.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.972
Every ruler at court
will hear how

25:07.974 --> 25:09.840
I lacked the power
to make my own nobles

25:09.842 --> 25:11.775
Deliver a simple commodity.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.844
They will hear how I couldn't
control my own queen.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.247
Tell them a different
story, then.

25:16.249 --> 25:17.982
Tell them how you
faced down your nobles,

25:17.984 --> 25:20.217
Forged an alliance
to feed your people.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.554
But the king didn't do that.
The queen did.

25:23.556 --> 25:26.190
In the king's name. I don't
see how this does any harm.
Mary,

25:26.192 --> 25:29.860
This is not about my vanity.
This is about my legitimacy.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.929
I am a new king,
trying to fill the shoes

25:31.931 --> 25:33.964
Of a man those people feared.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.033
I don't need their fear,
but I need their respect.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.103
How can I ask them for it
if I can't even get it from you?

25:39.105 --> 25:42.273
You don't think I respect you?
Not enough to obey me.

25:42.275 --> 25:44.642
Let me prove it, then.
Let me help them see...

25:44.644 --> 25:46.810
No. I'll have no more help

25:46.812 --> 25:48.779
From you. I've had more
than enough already.

25:53.151 --> 25:54.652
Kenna:
<i>You're awake.</i>

25:54.654 --> 25:56.787
Good news.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.322
Apparently.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.592
I met a noble lady and the noble
lady's very rich husband

26:01.594 --> 26:04.028
Wants to curry favor
with the king's deputy,

26:04.030 --> 26:06.096
So the very rich husband
is giving us a gift.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.632
What sort of gift?
A beautiful
chÃ¢teau.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.634
Not far,
modest in size,

26:10.636 --> 26:12.870
But more than an adequate
replacement for what we lost,

26:12.872 --> 26:15.606
And the noble is willing
to sell us title to
the land for a price

26:15.608 --> 26:18.742
That we can easily afford--
next to nothing, really.
I don't understand.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.277
Who would do such a thing?
How did this happen?

26:20.279 --> 26:22.279
It's all thanks to my
new friend, lady barnard.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.315
She seems very nice.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.750
Generous to a fault.
Oh, kenna.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.285
It's not a gift, it's a bribe.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.954
I'm investigating
her husband for murder.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.656
M... Perhaps the man
you're investigating

26:32.658 --> 26:34.258
Is some other barnard?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.826
No, it's
the same man.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.661
I had no case against him
until I found proof

26:37.663 --> 26:39.296
That doisneau was murdered.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.966
And now this bribe
is confirmation.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.635
I'm closer to proving his guilt
than I thought.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.003
You tricked me.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.005
Your husband is a criminal
and you are nothing

26:48.007 --> 26:51.308
But a deceitful...
I am a loving wife trying
to protect my husband

26:51.310 --> 26:54.078
From false accusation.
He is innocent.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.080
Bash will determine who
is guilty and who is not.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.615
He is the most honest
man I've ever known.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.116
Which is more than
I can say for you.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.385
It's good to love one's husband.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.054
I appreciate your devotion.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.623
But if you don't stop

27:05.625 --> 27:07.758
Your husband's
investigation into mine,

27:07.760 --> 27:09.660
Your devotion will be
to a dead man.

27:09.662 --> 27:12.396
The nobles already hate him
for trying to usurp the throne.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.264
That wasn't bash's intent
nor his doing.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.867
The two of you hang
from the thinnest of threads:

27:16.869 --> 27:19.403
Francis' and mary's
inexplicable devotion to you.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.406
It keeps you at court,
but it won't save you.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.009
It won't save your husband.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.284
(gasping)

27:34.286 --> 27:37.321
(applause)

27:41.326 --> 27:43.394
(horse neighs)

27:43.396 --> 27:44.862
(hoofbeats approaching)

27:45.864 --> 27:47.431
It's the german duke.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.367
I have been ill-used, lied to.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.802
<i>Verraten.</i>

27:51.804 --> 27:53.137
Herr schuler,
what has happened?

27:53.139 --> 27:54.238
What's wrong?
We rode

27:54.240 --> 27:55.439
To the garrison as instructed

27:55.441 --> 27:57.908
To release the prisoners,
as promised.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.943
But the prisoners
were not there.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.111
They'd been removed

28:01.113 --> 28:02.780
Two days
before.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.448
Impossible.
How did this happen?

28:04.450 --> 28:06.717
You are no more or less
than the son of your father.

28:06.719 --> 28:10.187
And it was your father who threw
innocent men into prison

28:10.189 --> 28:12.423
For no other reason
than the way they worship god.

28:12.425 --> 28:14.725
A prison
where they were tortured.

28:14.727 --> 28:18.362
Do not forget you are speaking
to the king of France.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.697
Show them.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.233
(gasping)

28:23.235 --> 28:24.301
Knee crusher,

28:24.303 --> 28:27.337
Cat's paw,
rat's cage.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.739
This is not our doing.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.074
Come.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.809
We'll find the prisoners
ourselves.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.810
Not with weapons, you won't.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.244
You're on french soil.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.212
Guards.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.018
Francis:
Herr schuler, please...

28:41.020 --> 28:42.920
You lie to your guests
and then you threaten them

28:42.922 --> 28:46.056
With violence?
We will not be treated this way.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.458
That is enough!

28:47.460 --> 28:50.160
Every man here will lower
their weapon!

29:09.013 --> 29:10.414
(sighs)

29:10.416 --> 29:12.816
(groans)
protestant germans

29:12.818 --> 29:14.284
Threatened by catholic frenchmen

29:14.286 --> 29:15.919
When they are our guests,

29:15.921 --> 29:18.088
Each side reminded of the hate
they felt for the other,

29:18.090 --> 29:19.790
And none of it
had to happen.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.425
I spent the last hour
convincing the germans

29:21.427 --> 29:23.494
We weren't
deliberately humiliating them.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.929
There's still time to fix this.
How?

29:25.931 --> 29:27.798
The deal with germany
is up in smoke, we have

29:27.800 --> 29:29.833
No grain and the prisoners
who were under my protection

29:29.835 --> 29:31.101
Have vanished.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.436
Then let's find them.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.171
Mary, I thought
I was clear.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.206
You cannot be a part of this.

29:36.208 --> 29:39.109
I won't talk to a single
nobleman or foreign diplomat.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.444
Not narcisse
or the germans,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.479
No one who knows
or cares who I am.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.947
But-but what will you...

29:43.949 --> 29:45.949
You have a delicate peace
to maintain.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.785
That is a king's work.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.787
And I have a mess to clean up.

29:49.789 --> 29:53.023
And that is, if you ask
your nobles, a woman's work.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.325
But this time,
since I got you into this,

29:55.327 --> 29:57.060
I don't mind doing it.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.001
I'm sorry.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.470
Then it's true?

30:08.139 --> 30:11.141
I dragged lord barnard
into my offices,

30:11.143 --> 30:14.244
Presented him with the
evidence in this ledger.

30:15.580 --> 30:20.017
But the proof
of doisneau's murder,

30:20.019 --> 30:22.352
The page was torn out.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.188
And it was obvious that
barnard knew about this

30:24.190 --> 30:25.556
Before he ever
entered the room.

30:25.558 --> 30:28.091
Give it to me.

30:28.093 --> 30:30.561
I can't. I burned it.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.329
I didn't do it for the bribe.
I won't take anything

30:32.331 --> 30:34.531
From them.
I did it to save your life.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.500
Barnard's wife
swore

30:36.502 --> 30:39.403
That you would be killed if her
husband were ever prosecuted.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.573
Kenna, we are better people
than the barnards.

30:42.575 --> 30:44.107
We have
to be.

30:44.109 --> 30:45.242
We just need the courage
to fight.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.510
Not if fighting means dying.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.845
I won't risk
the loss of you.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.912
I can't.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.516
I can't blame you
for wanting your husband alive.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.585
I should love you for it.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.520
I do.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.889
But there's something you
need to understand about me.

30:58.891 --> 31:01.291
This role that I now have,

31:01.293 --> 31:02.626
It matters to me.

31:02.628 --> 31:05.295
I will always fight
for what I believe,

31:05.297 --> 31:07.264
Risk or not.

31:13.471 --> 31:15.472
You were the guards

31:15.474 --> 31:17.875
Stationed at the garrison
where the protestant prisoners

31:17.877 --> 31:19.209
Were being held.
And yet

31:19.211 --> 31:20.544
You were absent
when they were taken.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.547
We stopped
at a tavern before.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.482
Like we always do.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.618
Them prisoners been
there for years

31:27.620 --> 31:29.353
And nothing ever happened
when we left before.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.622
How long were you
at this tavern?

31:31.624 --> 31:33.323
Well, there was a woman.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.658
A whore.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.660
She offered
herself to us.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.996
One after
the other.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.230
She was so beautiful.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.199
A face you could never forget.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.367
And why is that?

31:43.369 --> 31:44.968
Her left eye was blue.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.670
Her right eye was green.

31:46.672 --> 31:50.374
And she kept 'em open
the whole way through.

31:52.143 --> 31:55.646
Mary:
It was you. You took the
prisoners from the garrison.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.147
With the help of
a beautiful woman.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.682
One eye green,
the other blue.

32:00.485 --> 32:01.318
Why?

32:02.553 --> 32:05.222
I put my lover on a ship
to amsterdam.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.624
But the ship was commandeered
in german waters,

32:07.626 --> 32:09.927
All aboard taken captive.
So you took

32:09.929 --> 32:11.228
The protestant prisoners
to make a deal

32:11.230 --> 32:12.629
With the german
duke yourself.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.666
When I learned why the german
duke was coming to court,

32:15.668 --> 32:18.602
I knew it was the best and
only way to ransom my friends.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.604
I took the prisoners, yes.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.606
But do you know
why the ship was taken?

32:22.608 --> 32:27.411
Old hates between protestant
germany and catholic France.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.947
Hates inflamed
by henry's intolerance

32:29.949 --> 32:31.949
And prodded by his bankers
in rome.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.450
And your husband, despite
all talk of new beginnings,

32:33.452 --> 32:34.952
Has ruled no differently.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.019
You have it wrong about francis.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.654
Do I?

32:37.656 --> 32:39.323
On the day nostradamus
was nearly drawn and quartered,

32:39.325 --> 32:41.658
Francis sided with narcisse.
And at your expense.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.193
I am

32:43.195 --> 32:45.696
A man of France.
But I'm also a man of my word,

32:45.698 --> 32:47.965
And I promised
to get lady doutzen to safety.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.600
Even if doing so condemns
innocent men and women,

32:50.602 --> 32:51.969
Children to starvation?

32:51.971 --> 32:53.971
And you call
narcisse

32:53.973 --> 32:56.006
A killer who hides
behind skirts.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.109
I think that you're a better man
than that.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.677
Prove me
right.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.447
Deliver the prisoners
back to the castle.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.654
What kind of man wouldn't do
everything in his power

33:10.656 --> 33:12.522
To bring back the woman
he loved?

33:12.524 --> 33:15.092
The kind of man
who puts country before love.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.727
A king.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.128
Well...

33:18.130 --> 33:19.763
I'm only a prince, not a king.

33:19.765 --> 33:23.367
Thank god for it.

33:35.013 --> 33:35.679
Francis:
<i>What is it you want me to see?</i>

33:35.681 --> 33:38.315
(horse neighs, sputters)

33:38.317 --> 33:40.317
(horse neighs)

33:40.319 --> 33:44.421
It's conde with
the prisoners.

33:49.727 --> 33:52.095
We don't need
narcisse anymore.

33:52.097 --> 33:53.597
He'll see he needs us.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.332
(bell clanging in distance)

33:58.136 --> 34:00.137
Lord narcisse.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.705
Your majesty.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.608
It's a great day today.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.044
And made even better
by good news.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.779
Mary, why don't
you tell him?

34:08.781 --> 34:11.114
The protestant prisoners
have been located.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.116
We have traded
their liberty

34:13.118 --> 34:14.418
For some much needed grain,

34:14.420 --> 34:16.453
A boon to a
hungry France

34:16.455 --> 34:18.255
And to the cause
of religious tolerance.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.323
Is that all?

34:20.325 --> 34:22.526
No. I understand

34:22.528 --> 34:25.062
That you'd like
to teach me how to rule.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.097
Let me tell you
what I have learned.

34:27.099 --> 34:30.167
A king needs to know
who his friends are

34:30.169 --> 34:32.169
And keep making new ones
all the time.

34:32.171 --> 34:35.472
Luckily, there are so many
to choose from.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.475
Without betraying his old ones,
I trust.

34:38.477 --> 34:41.778
I don't think my husband needs
a lecture from you on betrayal.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.713
Do you accuse me of something?

34:43.715 --> 34:46.149
Oh, many things, I'm sure.

34:46.151 --> 34:47.818
But let's start

34:47.820 --> 34:49.486
With the betrayal of promises.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.455
Unless
somehow

34:51.457 --> 34:53.223
Your grain has arrived
beneath our notice.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.225
She speaks for you in this?

34:55.227 --> 34:57.461
"she" is my queen.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.863
And, yes, she
does. In this

34:59.865 --> 35:03.200
And most things.
You'd do best to remember it.

35:03.202 --> 35:06.136
Unless you want your king to
look elsewhere for friends.

35:06.138 --> 35:08.105
Because the time will come,
most unexpectedly,

35:08.107 --> 35:10.874
When you will need one,
I can assure you.

35:10.876 --> 35:14.244
Yes, majesty.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.546
Majesties.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.582
Oh,
and I'm pleased

35:18.584 --> 35:20.417
To inform you
that I've just learned

35:20.419 --> 35:23.720
Deliveries of my grain
will arrive here. Today.

35:35.766 --> 35:38.235
(horse sputters)

35:40.138 --> 35:41.538
(horse sputters)

35:50.915 --> 35:53.917
Thank you for returning
those prisoners.

35:53.919 --> 35:57.154
Why did you do it?
I suppose I wanted to be
the man you saw in me.

35:57.156 --> 35:59.322
The better man.
(chuckles)

36:01.192 --> 36:02.726
You will have
your german alliance?

36:02.728 --> 36:07.330
Not an alliance just yet
but an understanding.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.332
And as part of
that understanding,

36:09.334 --> 36:12.536
Lady doutzen and her household
will be returned home.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.205
Herr schuler was
very helpful.
You're a wonder.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.541
Queen, diplomat,

36:17.543 --> 36:20.277
White knight.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.879
Francis dealt with
herr schuler directly.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.248
It was his doing.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.884
He's a good man, you know,
and he'll make a good king.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.287
Your opinion is enough for me.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.889
And your lover,
lady doutzen,

36:32.891 --> 36:34.558
When will she
return to you?

36:34.560 --> 36:37.360
She won't.
But I thought...

36:37.362 --> 36:40.397
I didn't trade those prisoners
to bring her back to me.

36:40.399 --> 36:43.400
Lady doutzen was en route to her
husband when my ship was taken,

36:43.402 --> 36:46.403
A destination she will now
reach, thanks to you.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.637
She has children.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.839
He's a good and loving father.

36:49.841 --> 36:53.276
There's a powerful bond
between parents that...

36:55.846 --> 36:58.815
A bond you'll discover when
you have children with francis.

37:00.685 --> 37:02.419
Soon.

37:04.755 --> 37:07.891
Yeah.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.492
Francis.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.561
If I'm bothering you...
Bother?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.663
Never. He's your son.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.600
Francis, I-I know
you have bigger problems,

37:16.602 --> 37:19.002
But I asked the other nannies
about caroline

37:19.004 --> 37:21.972
And none of them saw anything
like what you described.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.441
Is there something you're
not telling me? Some...

37:24.443 --> 37:26.443
Indiscretion of hers?

37:26.445 --> 37:28.678
Not an indiscretion.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.849
No. I can't tell you about
caroline except to say that...

37:36.320 --> 37:38.788
...She reminds me of someone.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.590
Someone and
something

37:40.592 --> 37:41.825
I need to forget.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.561
Can we leave it at that?

37:48.466 --> 37:50.467
I was wrong.

37:50.469 --> 37:53.470
What I asked of you,
the backwards step.

37:53.472 --> 37:56.406
You must know,

37:56.408 --> 37:58.508
I want the same
world as you do,

37:58.510 --> 37:59.976
The better one.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.646
And the only way to
build it is together.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.415
We do greater things
when we act as one,

38:05.417 --> 38:07.450
When we trust each
other as equals.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.753
This is not a
coronation for a king.

38:11.322 --> 38:14.024
It is for a king and queen.

38:14.026 --> 38:18.028
â™ª we built these walls
of stone â™ª

38:18.030 --> 38:22.499
â™ª and then they crumble back
to dirt â™ª

38:22.501 --> 38:26.903
â™ª we spin these tales of love

38:26.905 --> 38:30.940
â™ª out of trust and hope
and hurt â™ª

38:30.942 --> 38:35.879
â™ª underneath our wounds

38:35.881 --> 38:39.749
â™ª where our demons
have their hold â™ª

38:39.751 --> 38:44.321
â™ª the truth can be exposed

38:44.323 --> 38:47.590
â™ª there's a strength
in letting go â™ª

38:50.494 --> 38:52.629
â™ª oh, oh, oh, oh

38:52.631 --> 38:56.499
â™ª oh...

38:56.501 --> 39:00.003
â™ª oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

39:00.005 --> 39:05.041
â™ª oh, oh, oh...

39:05.043 --> 39:06.543
All:
Long live the king!

39:10.815 --> 39:13.350
â™ª hey, hey, hey

39:13.352 --> 39:14.484
â™ª hey, hey

39:14.486 --> 39:18.988
â™ª here's to life

39:18.990 --> 39:21.391
(bell tolling)
â™ª hey, hey, hey

39:21.393 --> 39:23.493
â™ª hey, hey

39:23.495 --> 39:26.062
(bell tolling)
â™ª here's to life

39:26.064 --> 39:28.498
â™ª oh, oh, oh, oh

39:28.500 --> 39:30.100
All:
Long live the queen!

39:30.102 --> 39:32.102
(bell tolling)
â™ª oh...

39:32.104 --> 39:35.839
â™ª oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

39:35.841 --> 39:39.609
(bell tolling)
â™ª oh, oh, oh

39:39.611 --> 39:44.714
â™ª oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

39:44.716 --> 39:49.085
â™ª oh, oh, oh

39:49.087 --> 39:52.956
â™ª oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.559
What are you
doing out here?

39:56.561 --> 39:59.629
There's a party inside to
celebrate the new king.

39:59.631 --> 40:00.964
And queen.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.766
Her, too.

40:06.103 --> 40:08.638
And what do you want?

40:08.640 --> 40:11.875
You bought grain with your
medici money after all.

40:11.877 --> 40:14.544
Just not from me.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.413
True, it was a small amount,

40:16.415 --> 40:19.582
Hardly enough to solve
your son's problems, but...

40:19.584 --> 40:23.520
You weren't thinking
about your son, were you?

40:23.522 --> 40:25.922
Now you're going to tell me
what I think.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.625
There's a village in the north,
not far, not near.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.160
Your grain was delivered there.

40:30.162 --> 40:33.797
Compliments of
catherine de medici.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.999
Hmm.

40:37.535 --> 40:39.669
I hear the townspeople
are toasting your name--

40:39.671 --> 40:41.504
Their savior.

40:41.506 --> 40:46.109
But they're not the first
to benefit from your generosity.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.578
A church rebuilt,
a new well dug.

40:48.580 --> 40:52.515
And each town more grateful
to you than the last.

40:52.517 --> 40:53.783
I do what I have to do.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.018
For the people.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.519
You do it for yourself.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.688
To ensure that you're loved,
protected,

40:58.690 --> 41:00.924
By at least some
within the realm.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.660
For when francis and mary
produce an heir,

41:03.662 --> 41:05.528
And all your other children
move to the back of the line,

41:05.530 --> 41:07.630
And you with them.

41:07.632 --> 41:10.600
I don't see that happening
any time soon.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.602
Because mary hasn't fallen
pregnant yet?

41:14.205 --> 41:16.005
It can happen
in the blink of an eye.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.609
It hasn't been that long,
and they're both young.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.145
Just getting started.
