01:33.525 --> 01:35.692
God, do I
hate Paris.

01:35.694 --> 01:37.425
Not to worry.
Probably won't be

01:37.427 --> 01:39.228
around
much longer.

02:00.852 --> 02:03.585
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

02:03.587 --> 02:05.890
I guess what...
What I'm trying to say is,

02:06.123 --> 02:07.859
- Lisa, will you mar...?
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

02:09.728 --> 02:11.494
We're with
Tower security.

02:11.496 --> 02:13.562
Uh, we're
terribly sorry,

02:13.564 --> 02:15.465
but you're not
supposed to be here.

02:15.467 --> 02:16.698
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.802
So? She say yes?

02:18.804 --> 02:21.237
- I haven't asked yet.
- He hasn't asked yet.

02:21.239 --> 02:23.873
Oh, well, that's
a terrible shame, isn't it?

02:23.875 --> 02:26.375
Because, you see, that
blinking light back there

02:26.377 --> 02:29.311
means there's been
a breach in Portal 2.

02:29.313 --> 02:30.880
Which means,
in just a few minutes,

02:30.882 --> 02:33.348
the most vile creatures
in the entire universe,

02:33.350 --> 02:34.616
the Hive,
are gonna consume

02:34.618 --> 02:37.252
every last one
of us from the inside out.

02:37.254 --> 02:38.257
I don't understand.

02:39.858 --> 02:42.926
All will be explained
if you look right...

02:43.161 --> 02:43.896
here.

02:45.697 --> 02:47.564
The Tower was closed
for repairs.

02:47.566 --> 02:49.398
Ask her
on the way down.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.468
This way,
please.

02:52.736 --> 02:53.671
Thank you.

02:54.872 --> 02:56.441
Mind
the gap.

03:01.712 --> 03:04.413
Right. Shall we?

03:04.415 --> 03:05.584
Let's do this.

03:20.198 --> 03:21.231
Hey, guys.

03:21.233 --> 03:22.734
Who the hell
are you?

03:24.603 --> 03:26.469
Ask her again
down on the ground.

03:37.681 --> 03:38.982
- Whew.
- Ah, there you are.

03:39.217 --> 03:40.850
Yeah.
All right.

03:40.852 --> 03:42.618
Let's try this again,
shall we?

03:50.228 --> 03:52.362
So, what's
the play here?

03:52.364 --> 03:54.530
We've been
in this situation before.

03:54.532 --> 03:56.531
We've never faced
the Hive before.

03:56.533 --> 03:57.969
They've never
faced us.

03:58.203 --> 03:59.469
Always remember,

03:59.471 --> 04:01.336
The universe has
a way of leading you

04:01.338 --> 04:02.738
to where
you're supposed to be

04:02.740 --> 04:04.906
at the moment
you're supposed to be there.

04:04.908 --> 04:07.609
Yeah, well, sometimes,
the universe gets it wrong.

04:41.678 --> 04:43.913
"Let's have some action.

04:43.915 --> 04:45.714
I want some
asses wiggling.

04:45.716 --> 04:47.716
I want some perfection."

04:52.389 --> 04:53.391
Get my
three-wood.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.427
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, okay.

04:58.629 --> 04:59.564
Careful.

05:04.735 --> 05:05.937
Oh, my God!

05:07.338 --> 05:09.605
- Oh, my God. Baby.
- What?

05:09.607 --> 05:10.575
Uh...

05:11.709 --> 05:13.375
That wasn't
no animal, okay?

05:13.377 --> 05:15.644
It was a...
It was a...

05:15.646 --> 05:18.046
I ain't never seen
nothing like that before.

05:18.048 --> 05:20.348
It was, like,
a creature.

05:20.350 --> 05:22.752
What? Harold,
call the police.

05:22.754 --> 05:24.986
- The who?
- The police. Call the police!

05:26.723 --> 05:28.423
That was fast.

05:28.425 --> 05:30.625
Evening.
We're from Animal Control.

05:30.627 --> 05:32.995
- You saw something?
- We haven't called yet.

05:32.997 --> 05:35.565
Are we in danger?
Does it have rabies?

05:35.567 --> 05:37.433
That wasn't a regular animal.

05:37.435 --> 05:39.435
- It was like...
- The creature you saw was

05:39.437 --> 05:42.370
an unlicensed Tarantian
from Andromeda II.

05:42.372 --> 05:43.772
Very rare, very dangerous.

05:43.774 --> 05:45.873
- Sorry, what?
- A Tarantian.

05:45.875 --> 05:47.444
I know.
He looks cute now.

05:47.446 --> 05:49.512
- Tarantian?
- But when they hit puberty,

05:49.514 --> 05:51.049
they turn into real monsters.

06:01.625 --> 06:02.791
Shh.

06:02.793 --> 06:04.760
Don't be scared.
It's okay.

06:04.762 --> 06:07.029
Tell me,
is there anyone else in the house?

06:07.031 --> 06:09.401
Just our daughter.
She's sleeping.

06:12.504 --> 06:15.070
A raccoon.
Yeah, that's your problem, folks.

06:15.072 --> 06:17.505
Go ahead and make sure
those trash can lids

06:17.507 --> 06:20.644
are on nice and tight,
and we were never here.

06:23.613 --> 06:25.647
We should
go check on Molly.

06:25.649 --> 06:28.517
We've gotta
get you out of here.

06:32.057 --> 06:33.055
Come on.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.632
It's okay.

06:43.634 --> 06:47.570
I'm your friend. I'm Molly. Go on.

06:47.572 --> 06:50.141
Molly.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.177
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

06:56.413 --> 06:58.048
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

07:00.918 --> 07:03.153
Well, Molly,
you've scored excellent

07:03.387 --> 07:05.521
or above
in every area.

07:05.523 --> 07:08.022
Fitness,
deductive reasoning, logic,

07:08.024 --> 07:09.658
weapons training.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.928
Just one problem.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.598
You didn't check a box.

07:15.466 --> 07:18.804
For your preferred division.
Everyone has to check a box.

07:19.470 --> 07:20.205
Hm.

07:21.439 --> 07:25.007
Yeah, I made my own box

07:25.009 --> 07:28.947
for the division
that has no box.

07:30.848 --> 07:34.149
You know, the division
where they wear black suits

07:34.151 --> 07:36.752
and deal with the guys from...

07:39.956 --> 07:40.992
...up there.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.659
You mean, Accounting?

07:44.661 --> 07:45.661
No, like...

07:50.869 --> 07:52.800
Yeah, still...

07:52.802 --> 07:54.570
Accounting.

08:00.512 --> 08:01.976
That should fix the glitch.

08:01.978 --> 08:04.813
- Remember, we care.
- You're good to go.

08:04.815 --> 08:08.584
And remember, we care.

08:08.586 --> 08:10.786
Look for the icon marked
advanced extensions.

08:10.788 --> 08:12.620
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Click on it.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.522
<i>Which icon?
There's a bunch...</i>

08:14.524 --> 08:17.860
- Thirteenth icon from the left.
<i>- Whose left?</i>

08:17.862 --> 08:20.230
- Your left.
<i>- Oh, sorry.</i>

08:20.232 --> 08:22.531
- <i>I got it now.</i>
- Okay, got it?

08:22.533 --> 08:24.199
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

08:24.201 --> 08:25.935
<i>Are you still there?</i>

08:25.937 --> 08:27.870
- <i>Hello? Help. What's going on?</i>
- Oh, no.

08:27.872 --> 08:30.740
Nothing. Let me just run
a little diagnostic on my end,

08:30.742 --> 08:32.908
and I will be back.
No, it won't take long.

08:32.909 --> 08:34.144
Not long at all. Okay.

08:36.514 --> 08:39.046
What the f...?

08:39.048 --> 08:41.052
- This is perplexing.
- Is it?

08:42.219 --> 08:43.153
Is it?

08:44.889 --> 08:47.555
A-L-I-E-N-S?

08:47.557 --> 08:49.092
I don't know why
you always insist

08:49.094 --> 08:51.026
on whispering
and spelling that.

08:51.028 --> 08:52.994
Finally decided
to show up, huh?

08:55.099 --> 08:56.898
Oh, my God.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.269
All I have to do
is figure out

08:58.503 --> 09:00.238
trajectory, and I am in.

09:00.504 --> 09:02.271
- I'm back. Okay, try this.
<i>- Hi.</i>

09:02.273 --> 09:04.307
- Unplug it, plug it back in.
<i>- Okay.</i>

09:04.542 --> 09:06.244
- And remember, we care.
<i>- Hello?</i>

09:12.616 --> 09:13.551
I have to go.

09:15.785 --> 09:17.252
Jimmy's coming back
to get the kids.

09:17.254 --> 09:18.590
Yes.

09:24.028 --> 09:26.695
Okay. Let's see
where you are now.

09:29.267 --> 09:31.302
<i>Welcome back,
Professor Armitage.</i>

09:35.273 --> 09:37.873
Oh, you tricky one.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.311
I don't think you're
a meteor after all, are you?

09:40.543 --> 09:44.915
Nope, I think you are
an unauthorized landing.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.150
This is it.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.854
It's all happening.

09:51.755 --> 09:53.222
See you soon, Jimmy.

10:04.034 --> 10:05.834
Right here, right here.

10:05.836 --> 10:07.772
Right here.

10:08.871 --> 10:10.839
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.742
Please keep
the meter running.

10:12.744 --> 10:13.843
I'll pay you
extra.

10:13.845 --> 10:14.846
What?

11:17.107 --> 11:19.307
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, Jimmy.

11:19.309 --> 11:21.243
What are you doing
back on Earth?

11:21.245 --> 11:23.746
Hey, this is...?
This is Earth?

11:23.748 --> 11:25.012
My bad, guys.
Come on.

11:25.014 --> 11:26.415
Tell it to O back at HQ.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.949
I want to see my kids.

11:27.951 --> 11:29.419
Get this ship out of here.

11:29.653 --> 11:31.889
I'll escort our
Zamporian friend back.

11:45.102 --> 11:46.901
- Don't lose them.
- What?

11:46.903 --> 11:49.073
- I'm on it. On it.
- Go, go, go. Go.

12:17.434 --> 12:20.167
Hey,
did they bring in that Zamporian yet?

12:20.169 --> 12:22.171
Came in a couple of
minutes ahead of you.

12:22.173 --> 12:25.107
The guy tried to sneak in
behind a Perseid meteor shower.

12:25.109 --> 12:27.511
Amateur hour. Am I right?

12:27.745 --> 12:29.047
Right as rain.

12:31.048 --> 12:32.216
Rain don't lie.

12:38.923 --> 12:41.123
Sheesh, talk about
amateur hour.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.027
Hey, you gonna
call this in, or what?

12:46.331 --> 12:47.765
Code Black.

12:56.206 --> 12:58.807
<i>Unauthorized visitor.</i>

12:58.809 --> 13:01.009
<i>Lockdown protocol engaged</i>

13:01.011 --> 13:03.513
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

13:09.419 --> 13:11.920
All right,
who's she working for?

13:11.922 --> 13:13.421
She claims to be
working alone.

13:13.423 --> 13:15.324
A random civilian
simply waltzes in

13:15.326 --> 13:17.995
off the high street.
I don't think so.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.033
Neuralyze her.

13:26.104 --> 13:28.573
No, no, no. Don't.

13:28.806 --> 13:31.073
I know what that thing is.
Please.

13:31.075 --> 13:32.977
<i>Hang on. Hang on.</i>

13:36.147 --> 13:38.046
She had
an experience.

13:38.048 --> 13:41.349
It erased my parents' memories,
but it didn't take mine.

13:41.351 --> 13:44.520
So my whole life,
everyone's called me crazy.

13:44.522 --> 13:46.220
They said that
I needed therapy,

13:46.222 --> 13:49.056
which, okay,
admittedly, I did,

13:49.058 --> 13:50.959
but not for this.

13:50.961 --> 13:53.161
Did she really hack
into the Hubble Telescope

13:53.163 --> 13:55.964
to look at Andromeda II,
and we didn't catch her?

13:55.966 --> 13:58.068
In the old days,
we'd have hired her.

14:00.471 --> 14:04.406
It took me 20 years to find you,
plus or minus.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.311
How many people
can say that?

14:07.543 --> 14:10.581
I found you.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.924
So you found us.
You proved you're not crazy.

14:22.926 --> 14:24.993
You win the I'm Not Crazy
badge. Now what?

14:24.995 --> 14:27.329
- I want in.
- We don't hire. We recruit.

14:27.331 --> 14:29.633
Then I'd like
to be recruited.

14:29.866 --> 14:33.200
I'm going to need more.

14:33.202 --> 14:36.304
But would you mind giving me
one good reason?

14:36.306 --> 14:38.174
Because I'm smart.

14:38.176 --> 14:40.175
I'm motivated.

14:40.177 --> 14:42.044
I look good in black.
I'm...

14:42.046 --> 14:43.414
Boring me.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.351
Because I have absolutely
no life whatsoever.

14:48.919 --> 14:51.152
I have nothing.
I have no dog, no cat,

14:51.154 --> 14:52.487
definitely no chill.

14:52.489 --> 14:54.055
I have nothing
that I couldn't

14:54.057 --> 14:55.324
happily walk away from,

14:55.326 --> 14:57.359
which makes me
perfect for this job.

14:57.361 --> 15:00.463
Well, you're certainly
suitably tragic.

15:00.465 --> 15:03.331
No love?
No relationships?

15:03.333 --> 15:05.566
They just distract you from
what's important.

15:05.568 --> 15:07.905
Hm, really?
And what's important?

15:09.039 --> 15:10.942
The truth
of the universe.

15:12.076 --> 15:13.507
I wanna know everything.

15:13.509 --> 15:15.312
I wanna know
how it all works.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.479
You really think
a black suit

15:18.481 --> 15:21.016
is going to solve
all your problems?

15:21.018 --> 15:25.121
Mmm... No,
but it looks damn good on you.

15:25.123 --> 15:26.456
That's true.

15:44.207 --> 15:46.275
<i>From this
moment, you will conform</i>

15:46.277 --> 15:49.243
<i>to the identity we give you.</i>

15:49.245 --> 15:52.716
<i>You will dress only
in MIB Special Services attire.</i>

15:54.618 --> 15:56.484
<i>You have been trained
in the use</i>

15:56.486 --> 16:01.058
<i>of MIB-sanctioned technology,
vehicles and weaponry.</i>

16:02.359 --> 16:04.493
Mm-mm.

16:04.495 --> 16:07.065
<i>You will not
stand out in any way.</i>

16:11.134 --> 16:14.268
<i>You are no longer
part of the system.</i>

16:14.270 --> 16:17.138
<i>You do not exist.</i>

16:17.140 --> 16:18.473
Check, please.

16:18.475 --> 16:20.275
We are above the system.

16:20.277 --> 16:22.544
Over it, beyond it.
We are them. We are they.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.712
We are
the Men in Black.

16:23.714 --> 16:26.047
The "Men"
in Black?

16:26.049 --> 16:27.715
Don't.
Don't start.

16:27.717 --> 16:29.517
I've had
the conversation.

16:29.519 --> 16:31.554
They didn't seem
to be able to let it go.

16:31.556 --> 16:33.689
It's a process.
Attachment issue, I think.

16:33.691 --> 16:36.458
There's
your first assignment.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.526
Okay.
When do I get my...?

16:38.528 --> 16:39.730
It's called a neuralyzer.

16:39.964 --> 16:42.730
And you don't just get it,
you earn it.

16:42.732 --> 16:45.633
You've been accepted
for a probationary period.

16:45.635 --> 16:48.536
Impress me, and
we'll see about the bzzz.

16:48.538 --> 16:50.140
- Okay.
- Hm.

16:51.607 --> 16:54.475
You're a fan of the truth,
aren't you, Agent M?

16:54.477 --> 16:56.445
- I like it.
- Mm.

16:56.447 --> 16:58.479
I think we may have
a problem in London.

17:09.326 --> 17:10.795
Wow, that is smooth.

17:11.028 --> 17:12.526
Let's keep them coming,
shall we?

17:12.528 --> 17:13.694
Another
round.

17:13.695 --> 17:15.296
Ah!

17:15.298 --> 17:18.233
So can I just say how much
I'm liking this place?

17:18.236 --> 17:20.201
It's formal,
but not too stuffy.

17:20.203 --> 17:22.603
Classic, but still
kind of stylish.

17:22.605 --> 17:25.673
Makes it a very <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>
kind of vibe.

17:25.675 --> 17:27.308
I'm kidding.

17:27.310 --> 17:28.377
Sort of.

17:32.148 --> 17:33.547
Hoo, hoo!

17:33.549 --> 17:35.150
Or is it
mostly just

17:35.152 --> 17:36.684
the lethal high-stakes
gambling?

17:36.686 --> 17:38.353
Thank you very much.

17:38.355 --> 17:41.122
Would you look at that?
Straight to the ace, gentlemen.

17:41.124 --> 17:42.059
That's me again.

17:45.162 --> 17:46.463
Let's talk business,
shall we?

17:48.097 --> 17:49.797
I can move this stuff.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.533
Who do I speak with
about getting

17:51.535 --> 17:53.334
a lot more of it?
Because I'm in.

17:53.336 --> 17:54.271
You're not.

17:55.439 --> 17:57.206
You see, I have
a very strict

17:57.208 --> 17:59.408
"no Men in Black"
policy.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.142
Oh, God.

18:01.144 --> 18:02.443
I don't blame you.

18:02.445 --> 18:04.645
Who'd want those assholes
coming in here?

18:04.647 --> 18:07.615
Men in Black. The Morons
in Black, if you ask me.

18:07.617 --> 18:09.418
What a bunch of dicks.
Am I right?

18:09.420 --> 18:12.488
All it takes is one bad apple
to spoil any environment...

18:17.228 --> 18:18.559
Stop it, guys.

18:37.647 --> 18:40.417
I am MIB,
you Cerulian scum.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.687
And FYI, your little
club here sucks.

18:44.689 --> 18:46.721
You're gonna give me
everything.

18:46.723 --> 18:49.391
Suppliers, sellers,
your whole network.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.399
Your luck run out.

18:57.401 --> 18:58.902
You're already dead.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.573
Only one person here
has the antidote.

19:04.575 --> 19:05.910
Emily, sweetheart.

19:15.751 --> 19:19.222
Please, I'll... I'll give you
whatever you want.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.793
Please.
Anything you want.

19:24.228 --> 19:25.663
Anything I want?

20:09.506 --> 20:12.806
<i>The express
train to London has arrived.</i>

20:12.808 --> 20:16.711
<i>With continuing service
to Paris, Stockholm,</i>

20:16.713 --> 20:19.250
<i>Milan, Rome, Madrid.</i>

20:21.551 --> 20:22.918
Caught him
in the locker room.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.319
I knew that kid
was neuralyzing himself.

20:25.321 --> 20:27.822
I told him, "Do that too much,
and you'll go blind."

20:27.824 --> 20:29.458
Right?

20:29.460 --> 20:30.959
Who could go for a nosh?

20:30.961 --> 20:33.461
I'd like a
nice pastrami sandwich.

20:33.463 --> 20:36.267
With lots of melted cheese.

21:36.992 --> 21:40.362
<i>Now arriving,
express train from New York.</i>

21:40.364 --> 21:44.431
<i>Last call for Flight 2112
to the Cat's Eye Nebula.</i>

21:55.778 --> 21:57.911
<i>Welcome, Agent M.</i>

21:57.913 --> 22:00.785
<i>Please report
to New Agent Orientation.</i>

22:12.695 --> 22:14.898
<i>Access granted, Agent M.</i>

22:25.608 --> 22:28.044
<i>...every hour from Gate 12.</i>

22:38.654 --> 22:40.857
Excuse me, ma'am.

22:47.663 --> 22:50.965
It's never
who you think it is.

22:50.967 --> 22:52.803
Oh, no.
That one makes sense.

22:55.571 --> 22:57.006
So you're the one
who found us.

22:58.541 --> 23:00.074
Yes, I am.

23:00.076 --> 23:02.744
I'm T. High T.

23:02.746 --> 23:04.446
Oh, yeah.
You're...

23:04.448 --> 23:06.480
- I run this little circus.
- Yeah.

23:06.482 --> 23:07.782
Welcome, M.

23:07.784 --> 23:09.584
It's nice
to meet you, sir.

23:09.586 --> 23:13.121
O told me to expect
some great things.

23:13.123 --> 23:16.057
- And great things shall you get.
- Good.

23:16.059 --> 23:17.161
Right through there.

23:25.501 --> 23:26.867
Hi, you.

23:26.869 --> 23:28.805
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't touch him!

23:29.940 --> 23:31.073
Oh, God.

23:32.809 --> 23:35.178
- I got him, I got him.
- You guys...

23:35.412 --> 23:36.713
I got him. I got him.

25:00.596 --> 25:02.098
Change it, change it.

25:16.913 --> 25:17.847
All right, buddy.

25:19.148 --> 25:21.248
All right. Drink this.

26:14.871 --> 26:17.807
Oh, careful.
You break it, you buy it.

26:22.845 --> 26:24.911
Keep it. Keep it.

26:24.913 --> 26:25.848
On me.

26:26.982 --> 26:28.152
We need to see
the queen.

26:29.251 --> 26:30.186
Yes.

26:39.895 --> 26:41.598
Uh-oh.

26:42.699 --> 26:43.765
You have
visitors.

26:50.641 --> 26:53.307
State your business
with the queen.

26:53.309 --> 26:54.845
We need someone
to die.

27:01.917 --> 27:05.886
As clearly stated in Section 6C
of the Treaty of Andromeda II,

27:05.888 --> 27:07.354
we do not kill Jababians

27:07.356 --> 27:09.923
nor participate
in the murder thereof.

27:09.925 --> 27:11.861
This is nonnegotiable.

27:14.932 --> 27:17.030
Well, it's slightly
negotiable.

27:23.973 --> 27:25.805
<i>♪ Any sign, every word
Comin' out of your mouth ♪</i>

27:25.807 --> 27:27.741
<i>♪ You ain't got
A little information ♪</i>

27:31.647 --> 27:32.382
Oy!

27:34.884 --> 27:35.818
Morning.

27:37.119 --> 27:38.987
I'm in the market
for a useless, old,

27:38.989 --> 27:40.921
broken-down machine.
What do you got?

27:40.923 --> 27:43.123
You're not gonna
get a rise out of me, H.

27:43.125 --> 27:45.026
It's the Imperial
with the red tab.

27:45.028 --> 27:46.827
Do try to keep up.

27:47.864 --> 27:48.798
Thank you, Charlie.

27:57.641 --> 27:59.740
That's the old
portal depot.

27:59.742 --> 28:02.376
Site of the First
Great Alien Migration.

28:02.378 --> 28:05.013
Wait,
so Eiffel was an MIB agent?

28:05.015 --> 28:06.280
One of
the first.

28:06.282 --> 28:08.382
He helped so many
intergalactic refugees

28:08.384 --> 28:10.218
seeking protection
here on Earth.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.353
If you look closely,
you can see my grandma

28:12.355 --> 28:13.988
and my grandpa
in that picture.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.192
So beautiful.

28:16.726 --> 28:18.395
- Here you are, dear.
- Thank you.

28:33.911 --> 28:37.381
What's
up with that guy?

28:47.825 --> 28:49.958
Nerlene!

28:49.960 --> 28:51.461
Sorry.

28:51.693 --> 28:53.428
He's just
so yummy.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.930
- Who is he?
- H.

28:55.932 --> 28:57.864
Only the best agent
in the building.

28:57.866 --> 29:00.200
He saved the world once
with nothing but his wits

29:00.202 --> 29:02.504
and a Series-7
De-Atomizer.

29:02.739 --> 29:05.038
He saved
the world?

29:05.040 --> 29:06.109
From what?

29:07.143 --> 29:08.809
The Hive.

29:08.811 --> 29:10.311
The Hive.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.482
Hey, Guy,
do me a favor.

29:12.715 --> 29:14.882
- Handle my calls.
- Oh, love to.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.950
Where are you
going?

29:16.952 --> 29:18.154
To do some homework.

29:21.124 --> 29:24.892
An awful,
terrible incident in Marrakesh.

29:24.894 --> 29:27.428
The North Africa office
is investigating.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.197
And in
other business,

29:29.199 --> 29:32.299
H has decided to grace us
with his presence after all.

29:32.301 --> 29:35.036
Apologies, sir. I was working
late. Morning, everyone.

29:35.038 --> 29:37.104
So was I. Cleaning
your mess. Thank you.

29:37.106 --> 29:40.040
You should've seen the mess
I was cleaning up this morning.

29:40.042 --> 29:42.242
It was a totally
unsanctioned op, sir,

29:42.244 --> 29:45.278
requiring two containment units
and a full neuralyzer squad.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.015
I prefer to look at this
from a macro point of view,

29:48.017 --> 29:49.519
not get bogged
in the details.

29:49.752 --> 29:52.186
The bad guy's dead,
so, you know.

29:52.188 --> 29:54.988
Take a seat, please.
One last item.

29:54.990 --> 29:58.093
A member of the
Jababian royal family

29:58.095 --> 30:01.194
has a layover on his way
to Centaurus A.

30:01.196 --> 30:02.896
Vungus the Ugly.

30:02.898 --> 30:04.167
Inherited the title.

30:05.468 --> 30:07.934
Believe it or not,
Vungus here

30:07.936 --> 30:09.402
is the looker
in the crowd.

30:09.404 --> 30:11.072
Holograms always add
10 pounds.

30:11.074 --> 30:13.207
Jababian society doesn't allow

30:13.209 --> 30:15.977
for certain
indiscretions.

30:15.979 --> 30:19.180
In short, he wants
to be shown a good time.

30:19.182 --> 30:22.984
We could say no,
but Jababian mining vessels

30:22.986 --> 30:25.085
would grind us
into galactic dust.

30:25.087 --> 30:27.921
Some irony there, sir, if you
think that we used to, uh,

30:27.923 --> 30:30.056
protect Earth
from the scum of the universe.

30:30.058 --> 30:31.859
Now it seems
we're protecting scum.

30:31.861 --> 30:34.394
Actually, that's why it would
be right up your street.

30:34.396 --> 30:36.131
Your cup of tea, H.

30:36.133 --> 30:38.399
I know Vungus.
He doesn't really drink tea.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.934
He prefers vodka,
tequila,

30:39.936 --> 30:41.604
hand sanitizer,
sometimes all at once.

30:41.837 --> 30:43.572
Once, we woke up
handcuffed to a horse...

30:43.806 --> 30:45.206
- What, H?
- Pipe down.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.240
Sorry.
Sincere apologies.

30:47.242 --> 30:48.610
You will be
his chaperone.

30:48.845 --> 30:51.046
In fact, he specifically
asked for you.

30:51.048 --> 30:53.180
Okay. Absolutely,
hopefully we don't end up

30:53.182 --> 30:54.882
handcuffed to
a horse again, heh.

30:54.884 --> 30:56.049
Please.

30:56.051 --> 30:57.451
I'll have him home
by midnight.

30:57.453 --> 30:59.021
Good boy.
If you will.

31:00.189 --> 31:01.421
"Good boy.
If you will."

31:01.423 --> 31:02.923
"Good man,"
I think he said.

31:02.925 --> 31:04.257
Keep Daddy
happy, yeah?

31:04.259 --> 31:05.426
We're like this.

31:05.428 --> 31:06.927
You look
after <i>Papi</i> so well.

31:06.929 --> 31:08.363
You're so jealous,
aren't you?

31:08.365 --> 31:09.497
<i>Papi's</i>
little fancy boy.

31:09.499 --> 31:10.901
You wish
you had a <i>papi.</i>

31:12.836 --> 31:14.936
...They came in
on transportation...

31:22.412 --> 31:23.513
Uh, ahem.

31:25.347 --> 31:26.282
Hello.

31:29.419 --> 31:30.354
Whoo! Oops.

31:31.555 --> 31:33.988
- Sorry.
- Ahem. Hi.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.056
Hey. Nope, I'm awake.
It's all right.

31:36.058 --> 31:38.559
Just catching up
on my daily meditation.

31:38.561 --> 31:40.361
I have been meaning
to try that.

31:40.363 --> 31:42.162
I read that it
dramatically improves

31:42.164 --> 31:43.631
mitochondrial energy
production.

31:43.633 --> 31:45.668
Yep, yep.
No, it absolutely does.

31:45.902 --> 31:47.938
My mitochondrial energy's
through the roof.

31:49.372 --> 31:52.140
- Um... Have we met before?
- No. Agent M.

31:52.142 --> 31:53.940
I heard you were
on the Vungus meet,

31:53.942 --> 31:55.476
and I wanted
to offer assistance.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.378
I'm a bit of
a Jababian wonk.

31:57.380 --> 32:01.248
Language, culture,
politics, fashion.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.018
Anyways, I compiled
a dossier for you to read.

32:04.020 --> 32:07.121
Oh, a dossier. I love
a good dossier.

32:07.123 --> 32:09.157
The thing is...
Ask around.

32:09.159 --> 32:11.458
I work alone.
Ask anyone around here.

32:11.460 --> 32:14.261
Did you know that Jababians
are claircognizant empaths,

32:14.263 --> 32:16.096
which means
they can read your mind?

32:16.098 --> 32:17.532
And your cards.

32:17.534 --> 32:20.367
- Well, they do have a tell.
- What's that?

32:20.369 --> 32:23.238
Subdermal spots on
the underside of their arms

32:23.240 --> 32:24.971
- change color.
- Mm, good to know.

32:24.973 --> 32:27.373
Thank you for your offer.
I'm good.

32:27.375 --> 32:29.276
Okay. Message
understood.

32:29.278 --> 32:31.211
I will leave you
to your...

32:31.213 --> 32:32.246
meditation.

32:32.248 --> 32:33.182
Thank you.

32:35.652 --> 32:36.985
Oh.

32:36.987 --> 32:39.086
Do you know
what your tell is?

32:39.088 --> 32:41.157
You snore
when you meditate.

32:48.230 --> 32:51.100
Actually, on second thought,
maybe I could use some backup.

33:20.297 --> 33:23.030
I was thinking, for the op,
I can take the perimeter,

33:23.032 --> 33:25.667
- and you make the approach to Vungus.
- Yes, good.

33:25.669 --> 33:29.236
- Okay.
- The thing is, with this particular club.

33:29.238 --> 33:31.372
everybody just wants
to do their own thing.

33:31.374 --> 33:34.374
Aliens wanna look like humans,
humans wanna look like aliens,

33:34.376 --> 33:36.143
so we may need
to loosen up a bit.

33:36.145 --> 33:39.346
Maybe we lose
the tie first, yeah?

33:39.348 --> 33:43.284
Pop a couple of buttons
and not look so stiff.

33:43.286 --> 33:45.385
We don't want to advertise
our profession,

33:45.387 --> 33:47.121
if you know
what I mean.

33:47.123 --> 33:49.457
"Men in Black.
Aliens, get down!"

33:49.459 --> 33:51.392
- I get it.
- Don't do that.

33:51.394 --> 33:54.263
Yeah? Good. Great. Perfect.
How about me? How do I look?

33:56.231 --> 33:57.731
I would just, uh.

33:57.733 --> 33:59.132
- Do you mind if I...?
- What?

33:59.134 --> 34:00.334
Coming in.

34:00.336 --> 34:02.303
It's a fine line
between club casual

34:02.305 --> 34:03.773
and the saddest man
on Earth.

34:04.007 --> 34:05.271
Thank you.

34:05.273 --> 34:07.173
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. Shall we?

34:07.175 --> 34:08.775
I thought
that we were here.

34:08.777 --> 34:10.577
We are.

34:10.579 --> 34:12.344
Entrance
for special guests.

34:16.253 --> 34:18.186
Step on it,
would you, Freddie?

34:18.188 --> 34:19.389
You got it, H.

34:23.358 --> 34:25.362
Hm.

34:27.063 --> 34:29.530
Yeah, okay.
Wasn't expecting that.

34:48.251 --> 34:50.251
The Vungus among us!

34:50.253 --> 34:53.320
H-Bomb!

34:53.322 --> 34:55.188
- V-Go! V-Go!
- Yeah, yeah!

34:55.190 --> 34:56.657
- Yeah!
- Woo!

34:56.659 --> 34:58.760
Look at you.
You've lost weight.

34:58.762 --> 35:00.427
What have you done
to your hair?

35:00.429 --> 35:01.864
You changed it.
Looks fantastic.

35:02.097 --> 35:03.866
- Oh, I...
- I barely recognize you.

35:04.101 --> 35:07.233
Sorry. M, this
is Vungus. Vungus, M.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.670
Hello, M.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.472
Muah.

35:11.474 --> 35:13.407
So nice
to meet you.

35:13.409 --> 35:14.844
I've heard
a lot about you.

35:15.077 --> 35:16.411
Highly redacted,
of course.

35:27.389 --> 35:29.157
Such a charmer. He says...

35:29.159 --> 35:30.860
he thinks
you're hot.

35:31.092 --> 35:32.360
He thinks I'm what?
Sorry?

35:32.362 --> 35:33.863
It's a rough translation.

35:34.097 --> 35:35.862
Probably works better
on Ja... Jababia,

35:35.864 --> 35:38.834
but you know that,
since you speak fluent Jababian.

35:39.101 --> 35:40.700
Oh.

35:40.702 --> 35:43.873
Of course. I was just trying
to find the words to articulate

35:44.106 --> 35:46.673
how incredibly eye-catching
you yourself are.

35:46.675 --> 35:48.675
Well, that he is.

35:48.677 --> 35:50.711
M knows everything
about Jababia.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.280
I wouldn't say "everything."
Always more to learn.

35:53.282 --> 35:54.648
It's like
a fetish.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.650
Hah, okay, that implies
something sexual.

35:56.652 --> 35:57.887
- It's definitely not.
- It is.

35:58.121 --> 35:59.554
It's always,
"Oh, Jababia this,

35:59.556 --> 36:01.554
Jababia that, Jababia,
Jababia, Jababia!"

36:01.556 --> 36:02.856
Yeah, baby!

36:02.858 --> 36:04.726
I knew you would hit it off.

36:04.728 --> 36:06.626
Have a dance, okay?
M loves to dance.

36:06.628 --> 36:08.762
She's a wonderful dancer.
I'll get drinks.

36:08.764 --> 36:10.530
You're still
a vodka cranberry guy?

36:10.532 --> 36:11.865
You know it.

36:11.867 --> 36:12.802
Okay. Okay.

36:14.170 --> 36:15.570
M, please.

36:15.572 --> 36:17.905
Come, sit next
to Vungus.

36:17.907 --> 36:19.907
I promise, I don't bite.

36:19.909 --> 36:21.943
Okay, just give me
one sec.

36:22.177 --> 36:23.711
Four
vodka cranberries.

36:23.713 --> 36:25.479
It's all right.
I'll get this one.

36:25.481 --> 36:26.780
Put it on
the company card.

36:26.782 --> 36:28.416
Little tip,
expense everything.

36:28.418 --> 36:29.918
Hey, quick question,
no big deal.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.318
Are you pimping me out
to Vungus?

36:32.320 --> 36:33.753
What? No.

36:33.755 --> 36:36.423
What the hell would give you
that... impression?

36:36.425 --> 36:38.691
Hello. Ha-ha-ha!

36:38.693 --> 36:41.461
- Oh, I don't know. That?
- Oh, ahem.

36:41.463 --> 36:42.829
Better not look at that.

36:42.831 --> 36:44.764
Hey, if you wanna use me
as alien bait,

36:44.766 --> 36:46.266
just let me know next time.

36:46.268 --> 36:47.568
I don't like to be lied to.

36:47.570 --> 36:49.436
What, like pretending
to be an expert

36:49.438 --> 36:51.304
in something you're not?

36:51.306 --> 36:52.940
We're in
the lying business.

36:52.942 --> 36:55.543
- Are we?
- Jababians are prickly.

36:55.545 --> 36:56.876
We want them to be happy.

36:56.878 --> 36:59.380
So they don't destroy our planet
and everything.

36:59.382 --> 37:00.680
That is the mission.

37:00.682 --> 37:01.949
If you're not
down with...

37:01.951 --> 37:03.450
I'm down
with the mission,

37:03.452 --> 37:05.519
but I'm not fornicating
with the Jababian.

37:05.521 --> 37:06.990
That's not what
I asked you to do.

Vungus go home tomorrow.

37:23.706 --> 37:25.305
Tomorrow?

37:25.307 --> 37:27.277
We better make it
a good one, huh?

37:28.610 --> 37:31.945
I came to talk, H.
We need to speak.

37:31.947 --> 37:33.947
Talky, shmalky.
I want to see you dance.

37:33.949 --> 37:36.749
Come on. Come on, I know,
I know this is your jam.

37:36.751 --> 37:38.418

that night in Beirut,

38:01.610 --> 38:03.577
I deleted the photos.
Promise.

38:03.579 --> 38:05.882
No, not Beirut.

Whoo-hoo!

38:29.905 --> 38:31.338
Listen to me, H.

38:31.340 --> 38:33.039
This is serious.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.642
You're the only one
that Vungus can trust.

38:35.644 --> 38:37.378

You all right, buddy?

39:18.320 --> 39:19.987
What's wrong?
You don't look so good.

39:19.989 --> 39:23.090
- You okay?
- Vungus not feel so good.

39:23.092 --> 39:25.427
Vodka cranberry
sure pack a punch.

39:27.096 --> 39:29.130
Let's get his car
and get him out of here.

39:29.364 --> 39:30.731
- Yeah. Yup.
- All right.

39:30.733 --> 39:33.668
Okay.
Get you off to bed.

39:33.670 --> 39:35.970
Let's get you in here.
All right.

39:35.972 --> 39:38.005
There you are, buddy.
In you go.

39:38.007 --> 39:40.574
Watch your head. Okay.
All right.

39:40.576 --> 39:41.876
Now, sleep it off,
okay?

39:41.878 --> 39:43.943
I'll speak to you in
the morning. Hydrate.

39:45.414 --> 39:46.813
Whoo!

39:46.815 --> 39:48.682
- Shouldn't we call it in?
- Oh, God, no.

39:48.684 --> 39:50.050
The paperwork
is a nightmare.

39:50.052 --> 39:51.853
But Vungus
didn't look too good.

39:51.855 --> 39:53.653
He didn't look
too good before, but.

39:53.655 --> 39:55.623
Trust me,
I've seen him way worse.

39:55.625 --> 39:56.826
This one time
in Istanbul...

40:06.034 --> 40:08.605
Help me.

40:14.876 --> 40:16.911
- MIB. Freeze!
- On the ground.

40:16.913 --> 40:17.847
- Hands up.
- Palms down.

40:22.485 --> 40:23.420
- Palms down.
- Hands up.

40:25.121 --> 40:27.720
Which do you want to go with?
I'm fine with either.

40:27.722 --> 40:30.891
We've to come up with something
consistent. You want palms down?

40:30.893 --> 40:32.492
If you don't mind.

40:32.494 --> 40:33.797
- Palms down.
- Palms down.

40:35.431 --> 40:37.066
Good.

40:58.086 --> 40:59.021
What the...?

41:03.692 --> 41:04.825
That is not good.

41:04.827 --> 41:06.696
Run!

41:12.501 --> 41:14.668
M!

41:14.670 --> 41:16.135
They are coming!

41:16.137 --> 41:17.574
Petrol cap. Go.

41:33.956 --> 41:36.824
We need more firepower.
Side-view mirror.

41:36.826 --> 41:38.894
What do you want me to do,
throw it at them?

41:40.463 --> 41:41.264
Oh, wow.

41:52.141 --> 41:53.809
I haven't seen that before.

41:56.045 --> 41:57.847
I don't think
this is doing anything.

41:59.248 --> 42:00.182
Come on.

42:02.083 --> 42:04.617
Exhaust pipe. Go!

42:04.619 --> 42:05.688
Come on!

42:08.925 --> 42:11.925
Now this is
more like it.

42:11.927 --> 42:12.896
Right.

42:19.501 --> 42:20.769
Hurry!

42:23.539 --> 42:24.807
Go to Vungus.
I'll cover you.

42:31.179 --> 42:33.981
H! A little help here!

42:33.983 --> 42:36.816
No. Not H.

42:36.818 --> 42:38.885
He has changed.

42:38.887 --> 42:41.021
I could feel it.

42:41.023 --> 42:42.688
I have to know...

42:44.193 --> 42:46.796
...if I can trust you.

42:52.802 --> 42:54.700
Now I'm pissed off.

42:54.702 --> 42:56.905
Hide this.

42:58.740 --> 43:01.807
Something is wrong
in Men in Black.

43:01.809 --> 43:05.246
What? Vungus, what is this?

43:05.248 --> 43:10.150
It's the only thing
that can protect you.

43:22.130 --> 43:23.333
Come on!

43:27.869 --> 43:30.037
Where's your fancy
dance moves now?

43:52.994 --> 43:54.896
What the...?

43:57.266 --> 43:59.733
Keep your eyes on.
It's not safe.

43:59.735 --> 44:01.869
Eyes on! Eyes on!

44:01.871 --> 44:03.070
Two targets!

44:03.072 --> 44:04.740
How is he?

44:06.342 --> 44:07.644
He's gone.

44:15.284 --> 44:17.854
Guys,
back up a little bit, all right?

44:30.298 --> 44:32.331
Oy!
Outdone yourself here, mate.

44:32.333 --> 44:34.334
- Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

44:34.336 --> 44:36.235
Fill me in.
What happened, huh?

44:36.237 --> 44:38.171
We were attacked,
clearly, C.

44:38.173 --> 44:39.873
- Right.
- By I don't know what.

44:39.875 --> 44:42.309
The suspects, they did this
with their bare hands.

44:42.311 --> 44:43.976
They turned solid
into liquid,

44:43.978 --> 44:45.711
- then back again.
- What?

44:45.713 --> 44:48.749
- Why's she here?
- She...

44:48.751 --> 44:50.182
- She is
- AGENT H: She is

44:50.184 --> 44:52.186
Walking you
through the crime scene.

44:52.188 --> 44:54.722
No, no. She is
a probationary agent,

44:54.724 --> 44:57.423
so she is not here
at all, okay?

44:57.425 --> 45:00.193
I think you'll find
that she clearly is here

45:00.195 --> 45:01.327
because I can see her.

45:01.329 --> 45:02.729
- Backing you up.
- Thank you.

45:02.731 --> 45:04.197
A figure of speech,
but fine.

45:04.199 --> 45:05.999
You are in
so much trouble,

45:06.001 --> 45:09.369
oh, my God. You had one job.
You had one very simple job:

45:09.371 --> 45:12.171
to take some lizard slimeball
out for a few drinks.

45:12.173 --> 45:14.340
- That was it.
- Not a "lizard slimeball."

45:14.342 --> 45:16.309
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, no.

45:16.311 --> 45:17.878
- Yeah. Sorry about that.
- Mm.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.380
He was
a reptilian slimeball,

45:19.382 --> 45:22.316
now dead because of you.
Who was with him when he died?

45:22.318 --> 45:23.784
- I was.
- Who...?

45:23.786 --> 45:26.385
Okay, good.
And did he say anything

45:26.387 --> 45:28.322
that might explain why
he was killed?

45:28.324 --> 45:30.456
Anything at all?
Come on.

45:34.195 --> 45:35.461
No. Not a thing.

45:35.463 --> 45:38.231
- So just to recap...
- No point.

45:38.233 --> 45:39.766
A high-ranking member

45:39.768 --> 45:42.101
of the Jababian royal family
dies on your watch,

45:42.103 --> 45:44.403
murdered by assailants
that you can't identify,

45:44.405 --> 45:47.007
for reasons that you
cannot begin to fathom.

45:47.009 --> 45:48.842
- Is that about right?
- I switched off

45:48.844 --> 45:51.010
the moment you started
talking. I don't know.

45:51.012 --> 45:52.445
Why don't you bugger off.

45:52.447 --> 45:54.113
Okay, mate. Thank you.

45:54.115 --> 45:55.249
- Yeah.
- I'll piss off,

45:55.251 --> 45:56.916
- to the office.
- Where you belong.

45:56.918 --> 45:58.217
To have a word
with High T,

45:58.219 --> 46:00.522
who will not save you
this time.

46:02.891 --> 46:04.925
We'll be fine. Okay?
Don't worry.

46:04.927 --> 46:07.864
This is... We'll be fine.

46:09.164 --> 46:10.162
Yeah?

46:10.164 --> 46:13.066
Yes. Yes. Understood.

46:13.068 --> 46:14.469
Yeah... Indeed.

46:18.773 --> 46:20.139
Yes.

46:20.141 --> 46:22.242
Yes. Yes.

46:22.244 --> 46:23.546
Thank you.

46:25.146 --> 46:27.280
Let me assure you,
we will deal with this

46:27.282 --> 46:29.885
in the strongest
possible terms.

46:32.788 --> 46:35.121
The Jababians
want your heads.

46:35.123 --> 46:38.425
Quite literally. Both heads,
sent by diplomatic pouch.

46:38.427 --> 46:40.930
Okay, um, ahem...

46:42.297 --> 46:43.362
Morning, sir.

46:43.364 --> 46:44.998
I have the forensics report

46:45.000 --> 46:46.365
that you asked for.

46:46.367 --> 46:48.334
Thank you.

46:48.336 --> 46:51.104
Well, this is troubling.

46:51.106 --> 46:52.940
- Very troubling.
- Mm-hm.

46:52.942 --> 46:55.378
These are our suspects.

46:56.844 --> 46:59.045
A species called Dyadnum.

46:59.047 --> 47:03.117
From a binary star system
in the constellation Draco.

47:03.119 --> 47:04.950
Draco, that's
Hive territory.

47:04.952 --> 47:06.389
The entire sector
fell years ago.

47:07.923 --> 47:10.090
The Dyads' DNA...

47:10.092 --> 47:12.391
- are riddled with Hive mutations.
- Mm-hm.

47:12.393 --> 47:16.128
As we all know, the Hive
doesn't just destroy their enemies,

47:16.130 --> 47:18.231
they subsume them.

47:18.233 --> 47:19.999
Take them over from within.

47:20.001 --> 47:22.503
Whoever these two were,
they're part of the Hive now.

47:22.505 --> 47:25.072
Yes, but why would the Hive
send them all this way

47:25.074 --> 47:26.539
to kill a Jababian royal?

47:26.541 --> 47:28.508
You knew Vungus
better than anyone.

47:28.510 --> 47:30.276
Did he indicate
why he was here?

47:30.278 --> 47:31.878
Did he want something
from us?

47:31.880 --> 47:33.615
No, he seemed
pretty normal, happy.

47:33.849 --> 47:36.483
Sir. This whole thing
is a fiasco. It's a farrago.

47:36.485 --> 47:38.351
And a failure
of this magnitude

47:38.353 --> 47:41.023
requires
immediate invokement of...

47:42.090 --> 47:43.289
Article 13.

47:43.291 --> 47:45.458
Don't be a dick.
Who says "farrago"?

47:45.460 --> 47:47.994
Uh, what is Article 13?

47:47.996 --> 47:51.600
Immediate termination,
followed by neuralyzation.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.365
- Wait a second.
- Wait.

47:53.367 --> 47:54.534
- No.
- Is that your answer

47:54.536 --> 47:56.436
- to everything?
- Put that away!

47:56.438 --> 47:58.005
- Glasses off.
- Sir, you can't.

47:58.007 --> 48:00.173
Give me one good reason
why not.

48:00.175 --> 48:02.943
Um, because it's...

48:02.945 --> 48:04.545
what we were talking about.
Um...

48:04.547 --> 48:06.979
- Because...
- Because...

48:06.981 --> 48:09.249
if you erase us,
you will never know the truth.

48:09.251 --> 48:11.117
- The truth.
- They're stalling.

48:11.119 --> 48:13.255
- Say the word. I'll do it.
- Put it away.

48:14.489 --> 48:16.626
M, go ahead.
Explain yourself.

48:17.592 --> 48:19.662
Well, sir...

48:19.894 --> 48:22.898
if you think about it,
really think about it...

48:24.199 --> 48:26.398
Vungus...

48:26.400 --> 48:28.601
how many people really knew
that he was here?

48:28.603 --> 48:31.237
The people in this room.

48:31.239 --> 48:33.539
And perhaps a dozen
high-level agents.

48:33.541 --> 48:37.043
If those were the only people
that knew where Vungus would be,

48:37.045 --> 48:38.681
and we assume
that Vungus didn't leak

48:38.914 --> 48:40.380
his own location
to the killers,

48:40.382 --> 48:43.083
doesn't that mean
that it was someone...

48:43.085 --> 48:44.517
inside MIB?

48:44.519 --> 48:47.086
A mole, sir,
inside these very walls.

48:47.088 --> 48:49.322
Sir, they're making this up
as they go along.

48:49.324 --> 48:51.557
"A mole"? In the history
of the company,

48:51.559 --> 48:54.494
- there's never been a leak.
- Something a mole would say.

48:54.496 --> 48:56.295
- Don't be absurd.
- Classic mole talk.

48:56.297 --> 48:57.496
Sounds like Mole 101.

48:57.498 --> 48:59.199
Enough.

48:59.201 --> 49:01.101
If we've been compromised,

49:01.103 --> 49:03.070
it puts every citizen
on this planet,

49:03.072 --> 49:05.541
both human and alien,
at risk.

49:07.376 --> 49:09.675
- C. Track down these killers.
- Sir.

49:09.677 --> 49:11.677
Find the killers,
we find the mole.

49:11.679 --> 49:13.615
- Will do, sir.
- Dismissed.

49:15.416 --> 49:18.320
M, it appears
you're as sharp as advertised.

49:19.454 --> 49:21.621
Work the case with C.

49:21.623 --> 49:24.057
Get Weapons Department
started on something

49:24.059 --> 49:26.062
that can neutralize
these Dyads.

49:28.496 --> 49:29.498
Yes, sir.

49:34.302 --> 49:36.003
Sharp indeed she is, sir.

49:36.005 --> 49:39.072
I assume you'll want me
overseeing the case? Sort of...

49:39.074 --> 49:41.541
I'm finished covering
for you, H.

49:41.543 --> 49:45.278
You need me on this case, sir.
I've dealt with the Hive before.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.380
With nothing but my wits
and my Series 7...

49:47.382 --> 49:51.617
No. He dealt
with the Hive before.

49:51.619 --> 49:55.121
And I don't know
where the hell he has gone!

49:55.123 --> 49:57.725
I actually used to think
you could lead this place.

49:57.958 --> 49:59.427
I was wrong about you.

50:01.028 --> 50:03.099
We're done here.

50:05.634 --> 50:07.235
That's an order.

50:09.003 --> 50:11.272
Look, you weren't wrong
about me, sir.

50:13.007 --> 50:15.377
You saw something in me once.
It's still there.

50:16.677 --> 50:19.244
And I apologize
for letting you down.

50:19.246 --> 50:22.317
Give me another chance and
I'll fix this. I promise you.

50:32.260 --> 50:34.260
I don't think
it's just a blade.

50:34.262 --> 50:36.229
Looks like it carries
some poison.

50:36.231 --> 50:38.164
I know what
you're talking about. Wait.

50:38.166 --> 50:39.632
Sorry, mate.
High T wants me

50:39.634 --> 50:42.302
- to run point on this one.
- What? I don't believe you.

50:42.304 --> 50:43.771
I don't like
it any better than you,

50:44.005 --> 50:45.807
but he kept going on
about relying on me,

50:46.041 --> 50:48.175
needing our top agent,
that sort of thing.

50:48.177 --> 50:50.443
I don't make the rules.
Take it up with him.

50:50.445 --> 50:52.278
M, he's keen for you
to shadow me.

50:52.280 --> 50:53.782
"Learn from the best,"
he said.

50:54.014 --> 50:55.782
Little on-the-job training,
if you will.

50:55.784 --> 50:57.786
Hmm? Yeah?
Come on.

50:58.019 --> 51:00.253
- Are you going or you staying?
- Yeah, I'll go.

51:00.255 --> 51:01.420
- Well...
- Okay.

51:01.422 --> 51:03.623
- Come on.
- H?

51:06.161 --> 51:07.163
Thanks
for that.

51:08.597 --> 51:10.099
I'm sick of you.

51:12.567 --> 51:13.766
Okay.

51:13.768 --> 51:15.735
- What's the actual truth?
- You tell me.

51:15.737 --> 51:18.271
For someone who hates lying,
that was incredible.

51:18.273 --> 51:19.842
- I wasn't...
- It was electric up there.

51:20.074 --> 51:22.409
The way we played off
each other, back and forth.

51:22.411 --> 51:24.309
- I was riffing.
- A mole inside the MIB.

51:24.311 --> 51:26.112
It's genius.
I wish I thought of it.

51:26.114 --> 51:27.479
I discovered
a possible truth.

51:27.481 --> 51:29.749
I mean, think about it.
It would explain a lot.

51:29.751 --> 51:31.316
What have you got
so far?

51:31.318 --> 51:33.485
I was about to run
a molecular deconstruction

51:33.487 --> 51:36.188
on the substance and
cross-reference with all toxins.

51:36.190 --> 51:37.724
- Good idea.
- Just a little science.

51:37.726 --> 51:39.293
I wouldn't do that.

51:39.295 --> 51:40.492
Whoo!
I know what that is.

51:40.494 --> 51:42.195
That killed
a 300-pound Jababian,

51:42.197 --> 51:44.130
so I wouldn't get
recreational with it.

51:44.132 --> 51:47.133
Zephos, pure grade. The wrong
amount will kill you instantly.

51:47.135 --> 51:49.269
Right amount will
keep you dancing shirtless

51:49.271 --> 51:51.170
on a nightclub in Monaco
for 17 hours.

51:51.172 --> 51:53.706
So much information.
Always so much information.

51:53.708 --> 51:56.608
It's what I've heard. There's
only one place in the world

51:56.610 --> 51:58.847
where they know how to mix it.
Let's go.

52:02.516 --> 52:04.853
You coming?
World's not gonna save itself.

52:05.086 --> 52:07.454
Are you saying that you need me
to save the world?

52:07.456 --> 52:08.755
Uh-huh.

52:08.757 --> 52:09.755
Thought so.

52:38.653 --> 52:39.885
Oh, wow.

52:39.887 --> 52:42.157
You'll see that a lot
around here.

52:43.291 --> 52:45.559
It's a
Cromulian tag.

52:45.561 --> 52:48.394
In their galaxy, a symbol
for hope or annihilation.

52:48.396 --> 52:50.595
There's still some debate
around what exactly.

52:50.597 --> 52:52.398
Actually,
it's harmony.

52:52.400 --> 52:55.200
But on Earth, it means we're
entering an MIB safe haven.

52:55.202 --> 52:56.905
- How do you know?
- It's in the handbook.

52:57.139 --> 52:58.604
Don't believe
everything you read.

52:58.606 --> 53:01.240
- That is my job.
- And my job is what?

53:01.242 --> 53:02.508
Hang out here and shut up?

53:02.510 --> 53:04.209
Shut up. That's your job.

53:04.211 --> 53:06.311
AGENT H:
Well, look who it is. Nasr.

53:06.313 --> 53:08.382
no visible alien tech

53:08.384 --> 53:10.383
anywhere on the street.
Cover the bike up

53:10.385 --> 53:12.719
before I have to give you
a ticket.

53:12.721 --> 53:15.354
H? It is really you?

53:15.356 --> 53:17.523
Of course it's me.
Who else could it be?

53:17.525 --> 53:18.858
- Hey, Bassam.
- Hi, H.

53:18.860 --> 53:20.325
Nasr said you were dead.

53:20.327 --> 53:21.931
What? I... I never said that.

53:22.164 --> 53:23.896
You did. He's lying.

53:23.898 --> 53:26.432
Aah! Hey! Get...

53:26.434 --> 53:28.735
- That's...
- And why would I be dead?

53:30.871 --> 53:33.238
Bassam misunderstood.

53:33.240 --> 53:35.941
We heard that you and Riza
had split up.

53:35.943 --> 53:37.543
Oh, Riza. Who's that?

53:37.545 --> 53:38.980
It's not important.

53:39.213 --> 53:40.412
Mm. Human or...?

53:40.414 --> 53:41.880
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm just curious

53:41.882 --> 53:43.849
how it works
between species, so...

53:43.851 --> 53:45.987
Very unimportant.
Old friend of mine, so...

53:46.221 --> 53:48.887
Who runs the biggest criminal
syndicate in the galaxy.

53:48.889 --> 53:51.557
Who is a very successful
businesswoman.

53:51.559 --> 53:53.360
I love a businesswoman.

53:53.362 --> 53:56.396
- Why are we talking about this?
- Sad. You made a lovely couple.

53:56.398 --> 53:58.430
Thank you.
These things happen.

53:58.432 --> 54:00.867
You said, "That psycho's
gonna slit his throat."

54:00.869 --> 54:02.004
Oh, hmm.

54:02.237 --> 54:03.970
Excuse us for one moment.

54:03.972 --> 54:06.271
Your words, not mine.
Don't you...

54:06.273 --> 54:08.974
You dated this person? Seems
like a conflict of interest.

54:08.976 --> 54:11.677
Conflict of interest for you
to know my private life.

54:11.679 --> 54:13.313
Yeah, sure.
I'd prefer not to.

54:13.315 --> 54:14.947
Hey, hey,
that's enough. Listen.

54:14.949 --> 54:16.650
Stop beating
the hell out of him.

54:16.652 --> 54:18.650
- Yeah.
- Keep this thing covered up.

54:18.652 --> 54:20.286
- Absolutely. Will do.
- Thank you.

54:20.288 --> 54:21.720
Won't happen again.

54:21.722 --> 54:23.356
Nice to meet you both.

54:23.358 --> 54:24.493
- Yes.
- Yeah.

54:30.831 --> 54:33.499
- What?
- Pulled this

54:33.501 --> 54:35.735
from the surveillance
camera outside the club.

54:35.737 --> 54:37.936
Standing there,
making me feel uncomfortable.

54:37.938 --> 54:38.906
Sorry
about that.

54:43.945 --> 54:45.378
Have you shown this to T?

54:45.380 --> 54:47.313
You said everything goes
through you.

54:47.315 --> 54:49.347
Yes, everything does go
through me. Good.

54:49.349 --> 54:52.019
I'll show him. Go on.

54:55.456 --> 54:57.393
Goodness me.

54:59.393 --> 55:01.029
Oh, boy.

55:11.773 --> 55:13.373
Here comes trouble.

55:13.375 --> 55:14.576
I like trouble.

55:19.481 --> 55:21.815
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

55:21.817 --> 55:22.951
Call Riza.

55:25.420 --> 55:26.755
Ah, here. This is it.

55:31.827 --> 55:34.059
Looks like
a couple days' worth.

55:34.061 --> 55:36.364
No one's been out
to collect.

55:42.670 --> 55:44.440
Hello?

56:26.481 --> 56:30.550
One more step and I'll liquefy
your bangs, pretty boy.

56:30.552 --> 56:31.851
- Easy, easy.
- Okay.

56:31.853 --> 56:34.489
- We don't want any trouble.
- Do not move.

56:37.358 --> 56:39.159
Hey, look at you.

56:39.393 --> 56:40.994
What do we call you, sport?

56:40.996 --> 56:42.894
"Sport" is not
what you call me.

56:42.896 --> 56:44.164
What is it?

56:44.398 --> 56:46.766
- "It"? He.
- Sorry.

56:46.768 --> 56:48.135
Why would you call me
anything?

56:48.369 --> 56:50.503
Pawns don't have names.
We're pawns.

56:50.505 --> 56:54.139
Uh, okay.
"Pawny," then.

56:54.141 --> 56:55.474
What happened here?

56:55.476 --> 56:57.876
Oh, we had the best party.

56:57.878 --> 57:00.546
Kanye showed up
and dropped a whole new album.

57:00.548 --> 57:02.648
It was some of his best work.
Look around!

57:02.650 --> 57:03.816
We got our asses kicked!

57:04.920 --> 57:07.887
Aah! My queen!

57:10.123 --> 57:11.624
Oh, she's gone.

57:11.626 --> 57:13.825
I'll never serve another.
I swear it.

57:13.827 --> 57:15.494
I'll plunge my dagger

57:15.496 --> 57:18.597
into my own body, like this,
through my vital organs,

57:18.599 --> 57:22.469
and then leave it
until the dark takes me.

57:22.471 --> 57:26.139
Hey, you're not gonna actually
go through with this, are you?

57:26.141 --> 57:30.075
Listen. A queen's pawn
without a queen is just a pawn.

57:30.077 --> 57:31.644
A nothing.

57:31.646 --> 57:33.646
I must end my own life

57:33.648 --> 57:37.152
in the most painful way
possible.

57:38.887 --> 57:40.485
Don't stop me.

57:40.487 --> 57:43.722
Chance of survival: zero.

57:43.724 --> 57:45.925
- Think we should stop him?
- Gonna do it.

57:45.927 --> 57:47.793
Wanna see
if he goes through with it.

57:47.795 --> 57:49.961
- Sorry, what did you say?
- Hmm? Nothing at all.

57:49.963 --> 57:51.597
Know what?
I did say something.

57:51.599 --> 57:53.800
- You did?
- Yeah. He's a witness.

57:53.802 --> 57:55.534
Excuse me.

57:55.536 --> 57:58.537
You know, I don't think
that she would want you to,

57:58.539 --> 58:01.606
you know, go through with it,
honestly.

58:01.608 --> 58:04.911
Who are you to know what
a queen would or wouldn't want?

58:04.913 --> 58:06.679
Are you a queen?

58:06.681 --> 58:09.182
Well, to the extent
that all women are, yes,

58:09.184 --> 58:11.684
but, no, no,
I'm not a queen.

58:11.686 --> 58:14.552
You know what she is,
though, is an agent.

58:14.554 --> 58:16.257
- "Agent"?
- Mm-hm.

58:16.490 --> 58:18.858
- Is that a title?
- It is a title.

58:18.860 --> 58:20.793
A title of great eminence
and stature.

58:20.795 --> 58:22.230
M here is an agent.

58:22.463 --> 58:24.731
An agent without a pawn,
if you see my meaning.

58:24.733 --> 58:25.998
I never thought of this,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.166
but maybe the best way
to honor the dead

58:28.168 --> 58:31.037
- is to go on living.
- Yes.

58:31.039 --> 58:34.039
I pledge loyalty eternal to you,
Agent M.

58:34.041 --> 58:36.175
No, no, no. I'm not
interested in a subject.

58:36.177 --> 58:38.778
Too late. It's done.
I already pledged the loyalty.

58:38.780 --> 58:40.612
Wish you'd said
"no, no, no" before.

58:40.614 --> 58:41.815
Congratulations.

58:41.817 --> 58:44.150
And if you should die
before I,

58:44.152 --> 58:46.017
I promise
to end my own life...

58:46.019 --> 58:48.755
"In the most painful way
possible."

58:48.757 --> 58:50.923
Yeah. Ha. I don't like you.

58:50.925 --> 58:52.657
Let's go.

58:52.659 --> 58:53.860
My lady?

58:53.862 --> 58:56.965
Come on.
We'll have a fun time.

58:58.231 --> 58:59.601
- Fine.
- Yes!

59:01.936 --> 59:04.305
H, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

59:04.539 --> 59:06.671
- I've been wanting to tell you...
- Yeah?

59:06.673 --> 59:09.311
- ...about it. Where is it?
- You mean this?

59:09.543 --> 59:11.278
- You stole it from me?
- Stole it from you?

59:11.512 --> 59:13.979
I recovered evidence
you stole from a crime scene.

59:13.981 --> 59:16.715
Vungus told me to hide it and
I couldn't trust anyone.

59:16.717 --> 59:18.717
You're telling me
you listened to Vungus,

59:18.719 --> 59:21.655
you trusted Vungus instead of
your partner, a senior agent?

59:21.657 --> 59:22.988
- Huh?
- In a word, yes.

59:22.990 --> 59:25.726
H, speaking of agents...

59:28.096 --> 59:29.097
Come on.

59:30.532 --> 59:31.731
Why would they be here?

59:31.733 --> 59:33.599
There's either an award show

59:33.601 --> 59:35.601
we're not aware of
or we're in deep shit.

59:35.603 --> 59:38.070
Thank you.
I need you to close every street,

59:38.072 --> 59:39.304
archway and sewer now.

59:39.306 --> 59:41.240
Come in closer
on that body cam there.

59:41.242 --> 59:43.208
- A bit more.
- Could someone

59:43.210 --> 59:45.845
please explain to me
what the hell is going on?

59:45.847 --> 59:47.313
Sir, slightly
sensitive subject.

59:47.315 --> 59:49.014
Thought it best
to keep it quiet.

59:49.016 --> 59:50.983
- A bit further in, please.
- C, a word.

59:50.985 --> 59:54.056
Absolutely. No one leaves
the medina, all right?

59:55.155 --> 59:57.289
This...
This is nonsense.

59:57.291 --> 59:58.990
Despite
your personal feelings,

59:58.992 --> 01:00:01.362
H is one of the best agents
ever to wear this suit.

01:00:01.596 --> 01:00:04.063
No, he was one of the best
agents to wear this suit.

01:00:04.065 --> 01:00:08.036
He hasn't been the same
since the Hive. Look. Look.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:11.938
My sources say
that Vungus stole it

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.907
from the Jababian War Department
Advanced Research Division

01:00:14.909 --> 01:00:17.142
and brought it here.

01:00:17.144 --> 01:00:19.211
And you kept this from me?
For how long?

01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:21.880
- Explain yourself.
- Oh, explain myself?

01:00:21.882 --> 01:00:25.952
Sir, whatever that thing is,
M and H had it in your office,

01:00:25.954 --> 01:00:27.720
and you let them go, sir.

01:00:27.722 --> 01:00:29.891
With all due respect,
you let them go.

01:00:37.164 --> 01:00:41.233
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:41.235 --> 01:00:43.670
- And, C.
- Sir?

01:00:43.672 --> 01:00:46.037
Bring them
straight to me.

01:00:49.643 --> 01:00:52.010
Whatever that thing is,
Vungus died to protect it.

01:00:52.012 --> 01:00:54.715
He gave it to me
so it wouldn't go to them.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.686
- Yes, sir.
- H, listen to me.

01:01:00.688 --> 01:01:02.155
This isn't my operation.

01:01:02.157 --> 01:01:04.990
<i>Get out of there.
Get safe. Then report.</i>

01:01:04.992 --> 01:01:06.325
M may be right.

01:01:06.327 --> 01:01:08.260
You, I want sitreps
every 10 minutes.

01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:11.063
There could be
a mole in the Men in Black.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.374
All right. Take this.
I'll draw them away.

01:01:22.376 --> 01:01:24.943
I'll meet you
at the main square in 20.

01:01:24.945 --> 01:01:26.413
Go.

01:01:32.653 --> 01:01:33.922
Hey, guys,
what are the odds?

01:02:27.342 --> 01:02:29.342
Nasr!
I need to borrow your bike.

01:02:29.344 --> 01:02:31.242
As long as it is
to borrow, not steal.

01:02:31.244 --> 01:02:32.345
Yes. Of course. Quick.

01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:33.815
- Come on.
- Bassam!

01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:37.753
Ooh!

01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:42.255
- Okay, accelerator, brake.
- Water.

01:02:42.257 --> 01:02:44.822
- Very hot out there.
- That's very thoughtful of you.

01:02:44.824 --> 01:02:46.258
This is pretty
straightforward?

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.059
Yes. Very
straightforward, indeed.

01:02:48.061 --> 01:02:49.994
Just like riding a bike.

01:02:49.996 --> 01:02:51.832
Okay, cool.

01:02:58.974 --> 01:03:00.842
Sorry.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.085
Well, this is nothing
like riding a bike at all.

01:03:54.996 --> 01:03:55.931
Quick, jump on!

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.969
Hold on tight.

01:04:07.007 --> 01:04:09.610
Oh, shit!

01:04:11.846 --> 01:04:13.912
Hold on, Pawny!

01:04:13.914 --> 01:04:16.416
Hold on!

01:04:16.418 --> 01:04:18.450
Wait for me!

01:04:18.452 --> 01:04:20.387
Thanks!

01:04:25.827 --> 01:04:28.559
Ha! I can't believe
that actually worked.

01:04:28.561 --> 01:04:30.896
- Hey, H?
- Yeah?

01:04:30.898 --> 01:04:32.398
Oh, right. Glasses.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.334
Hi, everyone. If you could all
look right here.

01:04:35.336 --> 01:04:37.038
Just drive.

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:50.985
Move! Go!

01:05:08.202 --> 01:05:09.137
Oh, boy.

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:14.440
What do you think? Red button?
I think it's hyperdrive.

01:05:14.442 --> 01:05:16.075
No, I think
hyperdrive is blue.

01:05:16.077 --> 01:05:18.476
Sometimes you have to
trust your gut.

01:05:18.478 --> 01:05:20.080
My gut, not yours!

01:05:21.449 --> 01:05:24.550
Somebody press something!

01:05:49.543 --> 01:05:52.344
Whoo-hoo!
Lost the tail.

01:05:52.346 --> 01:05:54.112
What'd I tell you, huh?
Hyperdrive.

01:05:54.114 --> 01:05:56.682
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
- Trust your gut. Trust your gut.

01:05:56.684 --> 01:05:59.083
Oh, God, I hate sand.

01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:01.722
The red button was awesome!

01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:03.456
Let's press the red button
again.

01:06:11.065 --> 01:06:13.068
Wow.

01:06:14.702 --> 01:06:15.704
Hey, what's it doing?

01:06:17.472 --> 01:06:19.204
Moving.

01:06:29.684 --> 01:06:31.016
Oh.

01:06:31.018 --> 01:06:33.184
What...?
What is that thing?

01:06:33.186 --> 01:06:36.454
See the core?
How it keeps emitting convective energy

01:06:36.456 --> 01:06:38.691
across the interior of
the photosphere?

01:06:38.693 --> 01:06:40.358
Yeah, yeah.
No, I see all of it.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.595
I see the...
The photosphere bit.

01:06:42.597 --> 01:06:43.765
Okay, yeah. Shh.

01:06:43.998 --> 01:06:46.465
Those are thermonuclear
explosions.

01:06:46.467 --> 01:06:49.369
Wait, what? What does that mean?
Like a bomb or something?

01:06:49.371 --> 01:06:53.572
I think what we're looking at
is a super compressed star.

01:06:53.574 --> 01:06:55.340
And by the color
temperature,

01:06:55.342 --> 01:06:59.545
I'd say it's a blue giant.

01:06:59.547 --> 01:07:02.280
Let's press the button.
Let's see what this does.

01:07:02.282 --> 01:07:05.050
Are you suggesting we try
a weaponized star for fun?

01:07:05.052 --> 01:07:07.552
Mm-hm. Well,
for science and fun.

01:07:07.554 --> 01:07:09.521
The two aren't
mutually exclusive. Okay.

01:07:09.523 --> 01:07:10.655
I know.

01:07:10.657 --> 01:07:12.657
Yeah, there is
no better place.

01:07:12.659 --> 01:07:15.193
They don't call it
the Empty Quarter for nothing.

01:07:15.195 --> 01:07:17.195
That's why I made
the suggestion. Go.

01:07:17.197 --> 01:07:20.298
Uh, at just .001?
What do you think?

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.200
Yeah. Just start off slow.

01:07:22.202 --> 01:07:23.401
- Press the button.
- Okay.

01:07:30.545 --> 01:07:33.345
Mm. Maybe ratchet it up
a few notches,

01:07:33.347 --> 01:07:34.315
a little higher...

01:07:35.481 --> 01:07:37.152
Whoa!

01:07:42.356 --> 01:07:44.192
That was the low setting?

01:07:46.092 --> 01:07:50.229
Uh, do we think anyone's gonna
notice that wasn't there before?

01:08:01.442 --> 01:08:04.679
Sir, they got away.

01:08:06.614 --> 01:08:09.815
I believe
the appropriate phrase is...

01:08:09.817 --> 01:08:11.316
you lost them.

01:08:11.318 --> 01:08:13.488
Well,
I put it to you, sir...

01:08:14.755 --> 01:08:17.656
- ...that they had help.
- Probably.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:20.791
But I know H. Whatever
he's doing, there's a reason.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:22.794
Why do you
keep protecting him?

01:08:22.796 --> 01:08:25.667
Huh? What is it
going to take?

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:29.667
I am protecting
this institution.

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:30.837
From what? From me?

01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:32.670
Are you questioning
my loyalty, sir?

01:08:32.671 --> 01:08:34.809
At the very least,
your judgment.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:41.716
Is there anything else,
Agent C?

01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:46.551
- No, sir.
- Good.

01:08:46.554 --> 01:08:48.786
Then would you
kindly leave?

01:09:08.207 --> 01:09:11.544
Vungus knew how powerful
that thing was, right?

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:14.312
He knew it could destroy worlds,
and he gave it to you.

01:09:14.314 --> 01:09:16.714
I don't understand.
Someone he only just met.

01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:18.219
Why would he do that?

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:21.452
- I don't know.
- Hmm?

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:24.889
Maybe he trusted me.

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.593
I'm not gonna doubt
your general trustworthiness,

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:31.796
but, I mean, I sang
at Vungus' mother's funeral.

01:09:31.798 --> 01:09:33.432
Quite beautifully,
I might add.

01:09:33.434 --> 01:09:35.300
We knew everything
about one another.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:39.337
I mean, hey, I'm pretty sure
he trusted me. Heh.

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.474
Okay, H,
if you must know...

01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:44.442
he said that you'd changed.

01:09:44.444 --> 01:09:47.812
I'm getting sick of hearing
this "you've changed" crap.

01:09:47.814 --> 01:09:49.613
I'm the same person
I was years ago.

01:09:49.615 --> 01:09:51.417
You've always been
this way?

01:09:52.252 --> 01:09:53.419
What way?

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:55.286
Uh, vaguely inept.

01:09:55.288 --> 01:09:57.923
Arrogant. Reckless.

01:09:57.925 --> 01:10:00.593
- Did I miss anything?
- Heh. Okay, yeah. Hey, look.

01:10:00.595 --> 01:10:02.593
Arrogant and reckless.
That's nice.

01:10:02.595 --> 01:10:04.796
Maybe I am a few
of those things occasionally,

01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:07.799
but my job is saving the planet,
and that's what I do.

01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:10.468
I do a good job at it.
While that's still happening,

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:12.638
the rules are:
there are no rules.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.542
- Well, that's a rule.
- Mm-hm.

01:10:15.909 --> 01:10:18.910
Argh. Damn it.
All right, nobody move!

01:10:18.912 --> 01:10:21.280
- Drop it, hairball!
- Nobody move.

01:10:21.282 --> 01:10:23.816
- Bassam. How'd you get here?
- Feeling hydrated, H?

01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:26.718
Never had a bath before.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.956
- Lost 2 pounds in dirt alone.
- God, we drank from that.

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:32.523
Oh, God, I thought
it tasted like a living beard.

01:10:32.525 --> 01:10:33.726
Okay, um...

01:10:33.728 --> 01:10:35.826
Bassam, listen,
all right, mate?

01:10:35.828 --> 01:10:37.530
Uh, let's be sensible.

01:10:37.532 --> 01:10:40.000
I don't think you know
what you're dealing with, so...

01:10:40.234 --> 01:10:41.799
Oh, no, I definitely do.

01:10:41.801 --> 01:10:44.402
Which is why she's gonna pay
so much for it.

01:10:44.404 --> 01:10:46.772
- No, wait. Wait, wait!
- No, no, no!

01:10:46.774 --> 01:10:49.474
Have a nice life, bozos!

01:10:49.476 --> 01:10:51.278
Great job, H.

01:10:58.551 --> 01:11:00.988
Pawny, can you ask her
to pass me the torque wrench?

01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:04.623
She has a name and a title,
and you know that.

01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:07.261
My lady, the jackass wants
a torque wrench.

01:11:08.795 --> 01:11:11.495
Pawny, will you tell him
the sooner he restores power

01:11:11.497 --> 01:11:13.799
to my drive console,
the sooner I can figure out

01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:15.567
- how to program it?
- My lady says

01:11:15.569 --> 01:11:18.603
you're a cloth-brained ass-clown
whose gullible idiocy

01:11:18.605 --> 01:11:20.906
has threatened the very
existence of the planet.

01:11:20.908 --> 01:11:23.342
You know what, she didn't
say that. All right?

01:11:23.344 --> 01:11:24.910
You worst piece
on the chess board.

01:11:24.912 --> 01:11:26.844
- She said that.
- Didn't say any of it.

01:11:26.846 --> 01:11:29.781
Yeah, but I was thinking it.
Actually, every single word.

01:11:29.783 --> 01:11:31.753
You make a really good point.
Thank you.

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:39.860
If you'll tell your lady
she now has power.

01:11:41.561 --> 01:11:43.829
The jackass says, my lady,
that you have power.

01:11:43.831 --> 01:11:46.999
- Can you thank him?
- Really?

01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:48.866
But in a cold,
kind of polite way.

01:11:48.868 --> 01:11:50.769
You can even put a glare
on it.

01:11:50.771 --> 01:11:52.670
Just play around with it.
I trust you.

01:11:52.672 --> 01:11:55.041
My lady says thank you.

01:11:57.944 --> 01:12:00.713
I know where the weapon's going
and how to get it back.

01:12:00.715 --> 01:12:03.348
- My lady?
- I got this one. I'm listening.

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:05.683
Bassam has only one
real buyer:

01:12:05.685 --> 01:12:07.952
Riza Stavros.

01:12:07.954 --> 01:12:10.789
Riza? The Riza
that you went out with?

01:12:10.791 --> 01:12:13.525
The intergalactic,
alien arms-dealer Riza?

01:12:13.527 --> 01:12:15.360
I'm gonna hop back in
for a second.

01:12:15.362 --> 01:12:18.429
You dated Riza Stavros,
the Merchant of Death?

01:12:18.431 --> 01:12:20.565
The Mother of Murder?

01:12:20.567 --> 01:12:22.768
- She's pretty hot.
- Okay, I didn't know

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:24.836
she was an arms dealer
when we met.

01:12:24.838 --> 01:12:28.109
And I was distracted
by her feminine wiles

01:12:28.341 --> 01:12:30.407
and her
intoxicating beauty.

01:12:30.409 --> 01:12:32.745
And besides, we weren't
interested in labels.

01:12:32.747 --> 01:12:34.478
We were interested
in our hearts.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.414
If having a big, old heart
is a crime, then shoot me.

01:12:37.551 --> 01:12:39.017
Not yet.

01:12:39.019 --> 01:12:41.389
You'll let me know, though,
right?

01:12:42.588 --> 01:12:44.091
But really?

01:12:45.059 --> 01:12:46.627
Your "big, old heart"?

01:12:49.695 --> 01:12:52.732
- What?
- It's just...

01:12:52.734 --> 01:12:55.799
Well, it...?
It's funny, is it? Hmm?

01:12:55.801 --> 01:12:57.870
"My big, old heart."

01:12:57.872 --> 01:13:02.543
So stupid. Who talks like that?
Ha-ha-ha. Big, old doofus.

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:07.381
You've never been in love,
have you?

01:13:08.748 --> 01:13:10.815
I'm not making fun.
I'm genuinely asking.

01:13:10.817 --> 01:13:12.953
You've never once
abandoned logic for passion?

01:13:14.988 --> 01:13:18.089
What is this? The sequel to
<i>The Notebook?</i> I never saw it,

01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:20.759
but I assume it's a lot
of this type of nonsense.

01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:24.728
Heh. No, I haven't.
Passion is unstable,

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:26.598
- and logic is constant.
- Is that right?

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.800
Yeah. Physical attraction
is nothing more

01:13:28.802 --> 01:13:30.701
than chemical reactions
in your brain.

01:13:30.703 --> 01:13:34.039
Can't trust them.
They're not real.

01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:37.075
Isn't the whole universe
a chemical reaction?

01:13:37.077 --> 01:13:40.445
Pretty sure
you can trust that.

01:13:40.447 --> 01:13:42.150
Feels pretty real.

01:13:44.885 --> 01:13:47.454
That's actually
kind of deep.

01:13:49.989 --> 01:13:51.792
Well, that should do it.

01:13:55.962 --> 01:13:57.664
Power her up.

01:13:58.465 --> 01:13:59.833
Thank you.

01:14:00.934 --> 01:14:03.768
Pawny. Not there.

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.637
That's as
far as I could jump.

01:14:05.639 --> 01:14:07.805
I could jump higher, but it
would've been more awkward.

01:14:07.807 --> 01:14:09.543
Okay, enough.

01:14:11.112 --> 01:14:12.547
Here we go.

01:14:15.949 --> 01:14:18.884
And look at that.

01:14:18.886 --> 01:14:21.620
- Well done.
- Mm-hm.

01:14:21.622 --> 01:14:23.822
I know Riza. She may be
the Merchant of Death,

01:14:23.824 --> 01:14:26.558
but she does have
one weakness.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.960
Ready to be a hero,
little guy?

01:14:27.962 --> 01:14:29.230
Pretty open to anything.

01:14:29.462 --> 01:14:31.495
Good, because
we're going to Naples.

01:14:31.497 --> 01:14:34.766
Oh, to Riza's Fortified
Fortress of For Sure Death?

01:15:02.496 --> 01:15:04.265
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:15:08.002 --> 01:15:10.634
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:13.037
Can we do this another day?
I have another visitor.

01:15:13.039 --> 01:15:14.606
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

01:15:14.608 --> 01:15:15.840
Thank you.

01:15:15.842 --> 01:15:16.840
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:15:16.842 --> 01:15:18.512
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:15:22.815 --> 01:15:23.982
Luca.

01:15:23.984 --> 01:15:25.552
- Did you miss me?
- No.

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:37.163
H.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.735
I know why you're here.

01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:45.937
Why are you wearing
pink trousers?

01:16:01.755 --> 01:16:03.854
So how have you been?

01:16:03.856 --> 01:16:07.125
It's been a while, huh? That's
the tough thing about breakups,

01:16:07.127 --> 01:16:11.095
is the friendships
you lose. Heh. Ahh.

01:16:11.097 --> 01:16:13.165
We had some good times,
though, didn't we?

01:16:14.702 --> 01:16:16.902
Riza and I had
good times, I guess.

01:16:16.904 --> 01:16:19.071
You just lurked
in the background a bit.

01:16:28.114 --> 01:16:30.317
Wonderful, isn't she?

01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:32.183
I just love

01:16:32.185 --> 01:16:35.053
dumb,
beautiful creatures.

01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:43.894
Well, this is familiar,
isn't it?

01:16:46.766 --> 01:16:48.334
So...

01:16:48.336 --> 01:16:51.068
MIB finally
showed you the door, eh?

01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:52.970
Showed myself out,
actually.

01:16:52.972 --> 01:16:54.673
Oh.

01:16:54.675 --> 01:16:56.741
Some horses are born
to roam free.

01:16:56.743 --> 01:16:59.210
And others just get shot.
What are you doing here?

01:16:59.212 --> 01:17:03.284
I wanted to see you.
And I brought you something.

01:17:05.152 --> 01:17:06.918
I know
how you like special pets,

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.754
so I brought you
a peace offering.

01:17:08.756 --> 01:17:10.054
Meow,
meow.

01:17:10.056 --> 01:17:12.891
Bark, woof,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:17:12.893 --> 01:17:15.126
Oh, I like it.

01:17:15.128 --> 01:17:19.298
He is cute in an ugly
sort of way, isn't he?

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.299
The last
of his kind.

01:17:21.301 --> 01:17:23.968
You always did know the way
to my heart, didn't you?

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:26.972
You always knew how to make mine
beat that little bit faster.

01:17:26.974 --> 01:17:30.208
Not a neuralyzer in the
world could make me forget that.

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:32.009
<i>I was actually looking forward</i>

01:17:32.011 --> 01:17:34.380
<i>to seeing my guns tear you
to pieces, then I saw</i>

01:17:34.614 --> 01:17:38.250
that perfect little face
of yours, and...

01:17:39.752 --> 01:17:40.688
I had to know.

01:17:41.822 --> 01:17:42.757
Know what?

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:45.690
I want to know the truth.

01:17:45.692 --> 01:17:47.893
- Mm-hm.
- Was this ever real?

01:17:47.895 --> 01:17:49.396
Hmm? This?

01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:51.398
<i>You, me? Was it?</i>

01:17:53.233 --> 01:17:54.268
This'll be good.

01:17:57.837 --> 01:18:00.104
Was it?

01:18:00.106 --> 01:18:01.906
I knew who you were
from the start.

01:18:01.908 --> 01:18:04.209
My job
was to gain your trust

01:18:04.211 --> 01:18:06.410
and take you down

01:18:06.412 --> 01:18:09.748
when the opportunity came.
That's the truth.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.982
<i>Gotta turn my
earpiece off for this.</i>

01:18:11.984 --> 01:18:14.119
God, shut up.

01:18:14.121 --> 01:18:15.753
- What?
- No, I'm sorry.

01:18:15.755 --> 01:18:18.356
It's what I say
to my heart...

01:18:18.358 --> 01:18:20.258
when it's like a voice
inside my head.

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.959
Oh, I know.

01:18:21.961 --> 01:18:24.030
I couldn't fake that.

01:18:25.832 --> 01:18:26.865
Thank you.

01:18:26.867 --> 01:18:29.134
It's okay.

01:18:29.136 --> 01:18:31.769
No, but thank you for...

01:18:31.771 --> 01:18:33.204
For giving me closure.

01:18:33.206 --> 01:18:36.174
We all need some...
Some closure from time to time.

01:18:36.176 --> 01:18:38.479
- Get him out of here.
- What...? Wait, no. Hey.

01:18:38.712 --> 01:18:40.344
Wait.
I need some closure too.

01:18:40.346 --> 01:18:43.080
- What about my feelings?
- H, here's a tip for you.

01:18:43.082 --> 01:18:44.949
Next time you bring
a peace offering,

01:18:44.951 --> 01:18:47.285
don't make it the same day
I come into possession

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:49.287
of the most powerful weapon
ever created.

01:18:49.289 --> 01:18:50.988
This has nothing to do
with that.

01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:52.389
I didn't know
you had a weapon.

01:18:52.391 --> 01:18:54.258
It's a separate thing.
A coincidence.

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.128
Total coincidence. Didn't know
she had a weapon. Did you?

01:18:58.998 --> 01:19:00.331
Take him
to the boat.

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:03.104
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.

01:19:08.408 --> 01:19:10.375
Fellas,
I think that went pretty well.

01:19:10.377 --> 01:19:13.445
Looks like we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

01:19:39.005 --> 01:19:41.039
Okay.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.543
Okay, okay, okay. Shh...

01:19:43.943 --> 01:19:45.509
Sebastian, darling.

01:19:45.511 --> 01:19:47.478
How would you like
to be able to destroy

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.080
entire solar systems
without leaving your home?

01:19:50.082 --> 01:19:51.884
<i>- Pawny?</i>
- Yeah, I see it.

01:19:51.886 --> 01:19:53.821
Uh...

01:19:55.387 --> 01:19:58.091
Oh, would you look at that.
Good to go, M.

01:20:01.028 --> 01:20:03.128
Okay, Pawny,
it's all on you now.

01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:06.196
Okay, that kind of pressure
is not constructive.

01:20:06.198 --> 01:20:09.202
It's very simple, darling.
Do you want it or not?

01:20:10.436 --> 01:20:12.538
No, I only have one,
Sebastian,

01:20:12.773 --> 01:20:14.108
and I won't have that
for long.

01:20:15.309 --> 01:20:17.107
No, I'm gonna give you
five seconds.

01:20:17.109 --> 01:20:18.875
Perfectly done.

01:20:18.877 --> 01:20:19.813
Whoop.

01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:23.317
I'm going to call you back.

01:20:24.850 --> 01:20:26.116
Crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

01:20:26.118 --> 01:20:27.451
Look at your little legs.

01:20:27.453 --> 01:20:28.421
You are so fast.

01:20:30.023 --> 01:20:31.889
Why, look at you run.

01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:35.559
You're so fast!

01:20:35.561 --> 01:20:37.264
Wait, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

01:20:43.336 --> 01:20:46.507
Now, you don't run away again.
Oh, hello.

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:51.576
Oh, and here I thought...

01:20:51.578 --> 01:20:53.214
H worked alone.

01:20:54.314 --> 01:20:56.981
Silly me.

01:20:56.983 --> 01:20:59.250
Poor you.

01:20:59.252 --> 01:21:02.120
It's been a steep
learning curve, yeah.

01:21:05.257 --> 01:21:07.991
Oh, that? That's a snub-nosed
Karzig annihilator.

01:21:07.993 --> 01:21:11.197
Do you know what that does
to a human body?

01:21:12.533 --> 01:21:16.003
It boils you
from the inside out.

01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:18.137
Cute.

01:21:19.271 --> 01:21:20.640
Do you know what
a Pawny does

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.941
to sadistic
alien arms-dealers?

01:21:22.943 --> 01:21:25.143
No, honey.
Tell me what a Pawny is.

01:21:25.145 --> 01:21:27.348
I'm a Pawny,
you psycho!

01:22:14.261 --> 01:22:16.230
Looks like
the tables have turned.

01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:20.197
That was an incredible catch.

01:22:56.168 --> 01:22:57.304
That felt good.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:09.281
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It's all part of the plan.

01:23:09.283 --> 01:23:11.585
Well, H, you always have been
rather delusional.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.360
Peace offering.

01:23:22.362 --> 01:23:24.161
Kill them.

01:23:24.163 --> 01:23:27.197
Start with him
and make it hurt.

01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:29.735
No! You don't have
to do this.

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:33.103
Put me down,
you Tarantian thug.

01:23:33.105 --> 01:23:35.040
Wait.
Did you say "Tarantian"?

01:23:35.042 --> 01:23:36.777
- Yes.
- Yes, my lady, he did.

01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:39.611
They tend to be single-minded
when it comes to killing.

01:23:39.613 --> 01:23:41.379
Brains the size
of a pistachio nut.

01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:42.379
Okay, shh.

01:23:42.381 --> 01:23:43.683
You're not helping.

01:23:46.653 --> 01:23:49.588
The creature you saw was
an unlicensed Tarantian

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:51.222
from Andromeda II.

01:23:51.224 --> 01:23:53.057
Tarantian?

01:23:56.595 --> 01:23:58.396
I know a Tarantian.

01:23:58.398 --> 01:23:59.466
I met one once.

01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:01.532
I helped him.

01:24:03.036 --> 01:24:04.335
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

01:24:06.206 --> 01:24:07.141
What?

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:10.709
<i>Kabla nakshulin?</i>

01:24:10.711 --> 01:24:13.111
- What she said.
- How do you know that?

01:24:13.113 --> 01:24:14.481
Because he said it to me.

01:24:21.587 --> 01:24:22.687
Molly?

01:24:22.689 --> 01:24:24.254
Yes.

01:24:24.256 --> 01:24:27.259
Molly? Are you shitting me?
Really?

01:24:29.395 --> 01:24:31.495
Who's delusional now?

01:24:31.497 --> 01:24:32.498
It's you?

01:24:37.069 --> 01:24:38.335
You've grown.

01:24:38.337 --> 01:24:40.340
I mean, me too.

01:24:43.609 --> 01:24:44.844
Give her the box.

01:24:45.078 --> 01:24:47.477
Luca,
you can't do this.

01:24:47.479 --> 01:24:49.113
Haven't I been good to you?

01:24:49.115 --> 01:24:52.150
I've let you kill anyone
you wanted.

01:24:52.152 --> 01:24:53.284
Come on.

01:24:53.286 --> 01:24:54.587
No?

01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:58.824
The box.

01:25:03.262 --> 01:25:05.362
Thank you.

01:25:05.364 --> 01:25:07.430
You changed my life,
by the way. Heh, heh.

01:25:07.432 --> 01:25:09.201
Hey, uh, quickly.

01:25:09.203 --> 01:25:11.738
<i>Kabla nakshulin,</i>
what does it mean?

01:25:12.771 --> 01:25:14.205
It means:

01:25:14.207 --> 01:25:16.708
"One day,
I'll kill whoever you choose

01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:18.645
in the most gruesome way
imaginable."

01:25:20.279 --> 01:25:22.881
Or maybe we just
keep her here for a moment

01:25:23.115 --> 01:25:25.817
until he and I can discuss
a plan of action.

01:25:25.819 --> 01:25:27.718
H? H, are you okay?

01:25:29.355 --> 01:25:30.890
I'm good.

01:25:32.391 --> 01:25:34.491
That was...
That was a rush.

01:25:34.493 --> 01:25:36.294
Yeah,
and incredibly painful.

01:25:36.296 --> 01:25:37.794
- Yeah.
- Pretty sure the plan

01:25:37.796 --> 01:25:39.597
went wrong in
every conceivable way.

01:25:39.599 --> 01:25:40.534
Yeah, well...

01:25:42.536 --> 01:25:45.471
So, uh,
it's Molly, huh?

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.638
You're not supposed
to know that.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.241
Well, too late.
I know it now.

01:25:50.243 --> 01:25:52.343
Guess it's only fair
that you know mine.

01:25:52.345 --> 01:25:53.879
- I don't wanna know.
- I'll tell you.

01:25:53.881 --> 01:25:55.379
- Okay.
- You ready?

01:25:55.381 --> 01:25:56.513
Horatio.

01:25:56.515 --> 01:25:58.851
- It is not.
- It's not.

01:26:00.185 --> 01:26:01.320
It's Henry.

01:26:02.521 --> 01:26:03.821
Yeah, you look like
a Henry.

01:26:03.823 --> 01:26:06.357
- Good. It's all I've got.
- I'm Steve.

01:26:06.359 --> 01:26:09.360
Steve? I thought you said
pawns didn't have names.

01:26:09.362 --> 01:26:11.795
We don't.
I was just feeling left out.

01:26:11.797 --> 01:26:13.498
Oh, Steve.

01:26:21.541 --> 01:26:22.609
Whoa...

01:26:24.243 --> 01:26:25.643
Wha...?

01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:26.613
That is not cool.

01:26:30.817 --> 01:26:33.351
I don't like what
the earth is doing now.

01:26:33.353 --> 01:26:34.652
No, no, no.

01:26:40.894 --> 01:26:42.429
<i>Kabla nakshulin!</i>

01:26:45.265 --> 01:26:46.729
It was worth a try.

01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:49.969
We must have the
weapon, for the Hive.

01:26:50.203 --> 01:26:52.336
No. I don't know if
you've heard,

01:26:52.338 --> 01:26:54.608
but we are
the Men in Black.

01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:58.712
The Men and Women
in Black.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.545
Nice save.

01:27:02.547 --> 01:27:04.348
If you think
we'll hand this over,

01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:05.583
you've got
another think coming.

01:27:05.585 --> 01:27:06.851
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

01:27:06.853 --> 01:27:08.318
See, we protect the Earth.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.786
Everyone and everything on it.

01:27:09.788 --> 01:27:11.789
So you wanna do this?
You wanna get down?

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:13.460
Fine. Let's go.

01:27:17.463 --> 01:27:19.597
Move, and I'll obliterate
this entire island

01:27:19.599 --> 01:27:20.801
and everything on it.

01:27:22.969 --> 01:27:25.969
Including us. You don't think
we should've spoken about this?

01:27:25.971 --> 01:27:27.472
I just gave a whole speech.

01:27:27.474 --> 01:27:28.873
Yeah, I liked the speech.

01:27:28.875 --> 01:27:30.976
I just thought
this would be more effective.

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:32.943
You heard me.
Don't make me use it.

01:27:32.945 --> 01:27:35.615
We'll do anything
to protect our world.

01:27:40.286 --> 01:27:41.520
So will we.

01:27:58.404 --> 01:28:01.039
Nothing in this universe
is unkillable.

01:28:01.274 --> 01:28:03.607
With the proper voltage.

01:28:03.609 --> 01:28:05.442
Are you both
all right?

01:28:05.444 --> 01:28:07.711
Yes, sir.
Never better.

01:28:07.713 --> 01:28:10.317
- Sir, how did you find us?
- Experience.

01:28:11.717 --> 01:28:12.983
Riza again, H?

01:28:12.985 --> 01:28:15.620
When are you
going to learn?

01:28:18.024 --> 01:28:19.557
I knew
I could count on you.

01:28:19.559 --> 01:28:21.491
That, in the end,
you'd pull through.

01:28:21.493 --> 01:28:22.927
Thank you, sir.

01:28:22.929 --> 01:28:24.661
You too, M.

01:28:24.663 --> 01:28:27.000
Agent O had a feeling
about you, and she was right.

01:28:32.704 --> 01:28:34.604
The universe has a way
of leading you

01:28:34.606 --> 01:28:36.407
to where
you're supposed to be...

01:28:36.409 --> 01:28:38.845
At the moment
you're supposed to be there.

01:28:41.715 --> 01:28:42.783
Let's go home.

01:28:55.328 --> 01:28:57.661
Let's keep this safe,
shall we?

01:28:57.663 --> 01:29:00.565
Saunder,
inform the Jababian embassy,

01:29:00.567 --> 01:29:02.536
we have the weapon.

01:29:06.405 --> 01:29:09.840
Quite the first assignment
for a probationary agent, M.

01:29:09.842 --> 01:29:14.012
Marrakesh,
the Empty Quarter, Naples.

01:29:14.014 --> 01:29:16.817
Imagine what you will accomplish
when you're one of us.

01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:20.884
- Yes, sir.
- Enjoy this moment, M.

01:29:20.886 --> 01:29:23.356
They never last.

01:29:28.595 --> 01:29:30.760
I don't know how you do
it, but you keep doing it.

01:29:30.762 --> 01:29:32.796
Yeah? What's that, C?

01:29:32.798 --> 01:29:33.964
Well, saving the world

01:29:33.966 --> 01:29:36.633
from total destruction
twice...

01:29:36.635 --> 01:29:37.735
in as many years.

01:29:37.737 --> 01:29:39.103
I mean...

01:29:39.105 --> 01:29:41.104
- what are the odds?
- What are the odds?

01:29:44.077 --> 01:29:45.709
MIB!

01:29:48.447 --> 01:29:49.850
Right.

01:29:52.652 --> 01:29:53.920
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:29:59.057 --> 01:30:00.127
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:30:00.359 --> 01:30:01.525
How's it going?

01:30:01.527 --> 01:30:02.927
- Uh, you know.
- Cool party, huh?

01:30:02.929 --> 01:30:05.095
- Yeah, great party.
- Something is wrong.

01:30:05.097 --> 01:30:06.865
That's what
I was thinking.

01:30:06.867 --> 01:30:09.634
I said to the Dyads we'd
do anything to save our world.

01:30:09.636 --> 01:30:11.503
- They said that they would too.
- Mm-hmm.

01:30:11.505 --> 01:30:14.472
Then they told us they needed
the weapon for the Hive.

01:30:14.474 --> 01:30:16.473
What if we misunderstood
what that meant?

01:30:16.475 --> 01:30:18.942
Maybe they needed the weapon
to use against the Hive

01:30:18.944 --> 01:30:21.012
- to save their world.
- Mm-hmm.

01:30:21.014 --> 01:30:23.580
Which could mean they were
never the Hive at all.

01:30:23.582 --> 01:30:25.150
Uh-huh.

01:30:25.152 --> 01:30:28.119
But the DNA, the mutations.
High T showed us that sample.

01:30:28.121 --> 01:30:30.854
All right. Let's see.

01:30:30.856 --> 01:30:33.557
Agent H, bring up
the Dyad forensic report.

01:30:37.697 --> 01:30:40.464
Who has the authority
to make a case file disappear?

01:30:40.466 --> 01:30:41.902
Come with me.

01:30:51.778 --> 01:30:55.146
And what about Naples?
How did he know we were there?

01:30:55.148 --> 01:30:56.613
He was doing his job.

01:30:56.615 --> 01:30:58.648
Does his job
include tracking us?

01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:01.787
He gave this to me as a gift.
It has a chip inside it.

01:31:03.622 --> 01:31:06.490
We need to see the confiscated
Jababian weapon.

01:31:06.492 --> 01:31:07.958
Not possible.

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:10.195
Not possible? I'm the
senior agent on the case.

01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:12.562
Let's make it possible.
Where's the weapon?

01:31:19.137 --> 01:31:22.039
I think he's been chasing it
the entire time.

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:23.942
High T is the mole.
He's gotta be.

01:31:23.944 --> 01:31:25.876
A mole for who?
Where would he take it?

01:31:25.878 --> 01:31:26.910
Paris.

01:31:26.912 --> 01:31:28.978
My guess would be Paris.

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.848
I knew all along
that something was off.

01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:33.584
I thought
he was covering for you,

01:31:33.586 --> 01:31:34.919
but it turns out,
it was him.

01:31:34.921 --> 01:31:36.521
He was hiding
his own tracks.

01:31:36.523 --> 01:31:38.656
Gotta be an explanation.
M, come on.

01:31:38.658 --> 01:31:40.090
- I'm coming with you.
- No, C.

01:31:40.092 --> 01:31:42.826
Hey, hey. Come on, now.
This isn't about you.

01:31:42.828 --> 01:31:44.230
I know. I agree.

01:31:44.463 --> 01:31:46.996
Listen, if it turns out
what you're saying is true

01:31:46.998 --> 01:31:48.566
and word gets out that T,

01:31:48.568 --> 01:31:50.768
the most decorated agent
in MIB history,

01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:53.273
is a traitor,
the agency will never recover.

01:31:53.506 --> 01:31:55.606
If we stop him,
no one ever has to know.

01:31:55.608 --> 01:31:58.174
But what if
you can't stop him? Then what?

01:32:00.011 --> 01:32:02.079
Well, then
tell them it was me.

01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:03.915
Tell them
I was the traitor.

01:32:03.917 --> 01:32:05.752
Trust me,
the agency will believe you.

01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:09.856
You.

01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:19.265
Oh, that's right.
That happened.

01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:32.875
That's what
I'm talking about.

01:32:32.877 --> 01:32:34.111
I'm driving.

01:32:34.113 --> 01:32:35.916
Uh...

01:32:41.554 --> 01:32:43.254
That really
should be here.

01:32:43.256 --> 01:32:44.787
Not in this country.

01:32:59.037 --> 01:33:01.138
There should be
a big red button somewhere.

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.174
Yes!
Press the red button.

01:33:03.176 --> 01:33:04.110
Found it.

01:33:07.881 --> 01:33:08.879
Whoa!

01:33:24.162 --> 01:33:26.332
<i>H, you gotta see this.</i>

01:33:26.565 --> 01:33:28.766
<i>A portal from Sector C
has been activated.</i>

01:33:28.768 --> 01:33:30.034
The Hive.

01:33:30.036 --> 01:33:31.837
<i>I'm sending you backup. Out.</i>

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.308
You remember when I told you
we're in the lying business?

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.843
Mm-hmm.

01:33:38.845 --> 01:33:40.777
T said that to me
when he recruited me.

01:33:40.779 --> 01:33:42.679
He said,
"We have to lie to the world,

01:33:42.681 --> 01:33:44.815
which means we can never lie
to each other."

01:33:44.817 --> 01:33:46.317
I just don't believe
that he has.

01:33:46.319 --> 01:33:48.785
But you can't always
trust your gut, H.

01:33:48.787 --> 01:33:50.853
Sometimes things are
as they appear to be.

01:33:50.855 --> 01:33:52.889
No, we saved the world,
for God's sakes.

01:33:52.891 --> 01:33:54.691
Together,
with nothing but our wits

01:33:54.693 --> 01:33:56.029
and our Series-7
De-Atomizers.

01:33:57.095 --> 01:33:58.163
So I've heard.

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:35.435
- H?
- Yeah?

01:34:35.667 --> 01:34:37.768
Mind telling me
one more time?

01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:38.872
How'd you beat the Hive?

01:34:40.073 --> 01:34:41.838
Uh, it was
three years ago.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.443
High T and I
went to face the Hive

01:34:43.676 --> 01:34:47.143
with nothing but our wits and
our Series-7 De-Atomizers. Cool?

01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:48.812
Yes, but how'd you do it?

01:34:48.814 --> 01:34:50.281
Wait. What are you doing?

01:34:50.283 --> 01:34:52.316
- I'm curious. How'd you do it?
- I told you.

01:34:52.318 --> 01:34:54.418
- You didn't, though.
- I did a few times.

01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:57.088
Okay, High T and I went up
to face the Hive

01:34:57.090 --> 01:35:00.126
with nothing but our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers...

01:35:06.231 --> 01:35:08.965
Am I...?
I'm repeating myself, aren't I?

01:35:08.967 --> 01:35:10.867
- Over and over.
- Word for word.

01:35:10.869 --> 01:35:13.771
Yeah, um... Okay,
why would I be doing that?

01:35:13.773 --> 01:35:16.109
H, I don't think that you beat
the Hive that night.

01:35:17.176 --> 01:35:19.112
I think you were neuralyzed.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.433
Ah. You came to say goodbye.

01:35:43.435 --> 01:35:45.371
And you brought the lovely M.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.475
You can really feel
the history here.

01:35:49.708 --> 01:35:52.276
Eiffel
discovering wormholes,

01:35:52.278 --> 01:35:54.812
gangways to
other civilizations,

01:35:54.814 --> 01:35:57.751
the First Alien Migration.

01:35:59.251 --> 01:36:02.919
And we made history here too,
didn't we, H?

01:36:02.921 --> 01:36:05.923
With just our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers.

01:36:05.925 --> 01:36:08.259
No. We didn't.

01:36:08.261 --> 01:36:11.497
The Hive wanted the most
powerful weapon in the galaxy,

01:36:11.730 --> 01:36:14.298
so you had Vungus bring it
to Men in Black.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.799
You'd wait. When it came,
you'd give it to them.

01:36:16.801 --> 01:36:20.937
My dear boy, you were always
a bright one...

01:36:20.939 --> 01:36:22.973
but there's no stopping this.

01:36:22.975 --> 01:36:26.343
With the weapon out of the way,
every planet will fall,

01:36:26.345 --> 01:36:28.178
starting with this one.

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:29.882
Step away from the controls.

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:33.017
You neuralyzed me.

01:36:33.019 --> 01:36:36.254
Made me a hero,
the guy that saved the world.

01:36:36.256 --> 01:36:38.455
Left alive to sell the lie.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.395
They wanted this.

01:36:43.996 --> 01:36:45.064
You were there.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.901
You were always
like a son to me.

01:36:49.903 --> 01:36:51.067
H?

01:36:51.069 --> 01:36:54.071
You were always
like a son to me.

01:36:54.073 --> 01:36:55.541
That's not High T anymore.

01:36:55.774 --> 01:36:57.040
You were always
like a son

01:36:57.042 --> 01:36:58.143
to him.

01:37:14.525 --> 01:37:15.960
Shoot it! Shoot it!

01:37:20.466 --> 01:37:22.299
My queen!

01:37:22.301 --> 01:37:23.933
I'm coming!

01:37:38.117 --> 01:37:39.950
What do we do?
What do we do?

01:37:57.269 --> 01:37:58.637
I'm gonna get it back.

01:37:58.871 --> 01:38:00.940
I know he's still
in there somewhere.

01:38:02.274 --> 01:38:03.574
Hey!

01:38:03.576 --> 01:38:06.479
Hey! I know
you're in there somewhere!

01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:12.383
It's me, H.

01:38:12.385 --> 01:38:15.121
Remember, you wanted me
to take your place.

01:38:19.425 --> 01:38:20.557
M!

01:38:25.497 --> 01:38:28.098
<i>The truth of the universe.</i>

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:29.569
I want to know
how it all works.

01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:33.638
The universe has a way
of leading you

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.272
to where you're
supposed to be.

01:38:37.176 --> 01:38:39.512
<i>At the moment
you're supposed to be there.</i>

01:38:41.881 --> 01:38:44.584
My queen!

01:38:51.122 --> 01:38:53.259
I'm not losing another queen.

01:39:05.069 --> 01:39:07.572
You said
I was like a son to you.

01:39:08.974 --> 01:39:11.511
You were like
a father to me.

01:39:14.947 --> 01:39:15.681
H.

01:39:35.333 --> 01:39:36.402
Right time...

01:39:37.536 --> 01:39:38.668
right place.

01:40:02.994 --> 01:40:03.729
Pawny?

01:40:05.264 --> 01:40:08.365
- Yeah?
- You've served your queen well.

01:40:08.367 --> 01:40:10.232
Thank you, my lady.

01:40:10.234 --> 01:40:12.037
It was my honor.

01:40:48.774 --> 01:40:51.340
So is she as tough as they say?

01:40:51.342 --> 01:40:52.778
In a word, yes.

01:40:54.546 --> 01:40:57.112
- Well, you didn't screw up.
- No, ma'am.

01:40:57.114 --> 01:41:00.183
Let's be honest,
there were a few bumps along the way,

01:41:00.185 --> 01:41:02.318
- friction at the start...
- Let's not be honest.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.222
Okay. No,
we did not screw up.

01:41:05.224 --> 01:41:08.558
You said there may be a problem
in London, but you knew.

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.760
I hadn't trusted London branch
for some time.

01:41:10.762 --> 01:41:13.265
I never understood
the reason why.

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.333
T lived for
this organization.

01:41:16.335 --> 01:41:19.204
He was the very best
we had to offer. He will be...

01:41:23.542 --> 01:41:25.474
...missed.

01:41:28.579 --> 01:41:30.613
Welcome to the circus,
Agent M.

01:41:30.615 --> 01:41:33.185
You are no longer
probationary.

01:41:35.554 --> 01:41:37.856
Well, there you go.
My work here is done, I...

01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:39.790
- You are.
- I'm sorry, what?

01:41:39.792 --> 01:41:41.827
Probationary head
of London branch.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.160
I'm sorry.
Probationary head?

01:41:44.162 --> 01:41:48.165
It sounds like I got promoted
and demoted at the same time.

01:41:48.167 --> 01:41:50.836
No. Try and cope.

01:41:51.069 --> 01:41:53.570
Several years ago, before
all this, T mentioned to me

01:41:53.572 --> 01:41:56.440
a young, up-and-coming
field agent who had certain

01:41:56.442 --> 01:41:58.208
leadership qualities,
shall we say.

01:41:58.210 --> 01:41:59.744
Was his faith in you
misplaced?

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.580
No, I just think
there are

01:42:02.582 --> 01:42:04.714
far more experienced
agents than myself.

01:42:04.716 --> 01:42:07.317
Yeah, there are.
But you have the full support

01:42:07.319 --> 01:42:09.687
of our senior staff
and, by the way, Agent C.

01:42:09.689 --> 01:42:11.624
Is that right?

01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:19.562
- Do I take it you accept?
- Yes.

01:42:19.564 --> 01:42:21.498
Good. I'll talk to
the bosses upstairs.

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.232
You need to clear
your London desk

01:42:23.234 --> 01:42:25.835
and report to MIB
in New York on Monday.

01:42:25.837 --> 01:42:27.739
New York.

01:42:29.307 --> 01:42:30.473
Thank you, Agent O.

01:42:33.479 --> 01:42:34.880
Congratulations,
probie.

01:42:35.113 --> 01:42:36.883
Congratulations to you too.

01:42:41.487 --> 01:42:43.786
You'll want to
brief your agents.

01:42:43.788 --> 01:42:45.423
Walk with me.

01:42:47.592 --> 01:42:50.660
So you wanted to know
how it all works.

01:42:50.662 --> 01:42:52.394
Now you do.

01:42:52.396 --> 01:42:56.568
And as you will no doubt
have divined, Agent M,

01:42:57.569 --> 01:42:59.472
there's a price.

01:43:38.677 --> 01:43:40.376
Nope.

01:43:40.378 --> 01:43:42.611
Hey there.
What are you doing?

01:43:42.613 --> 01:43:43.982
I told O I had to
take care of

01:43:44.216 --> 01:43:45.781
a couple things
before I went back.

01:43:45.783 --> 01:43:47.483
Yeah? What,
like stealing my car?

01:43:47.485 --> 01:43:49.820
No, like driving it.

01:43:49.822 --> 01:43:51.620
You're on the right side,
at least.

01:43:51.622 --> 01:43:52.722
I'm a quick study.

01:43:52.724 --> 01:43:54.357
Give me a lift
back to London?

01:43:54.359 --> 01:43:55.761
Road trip.

01:43:59.463 --> 01:44:01.298
Up, up, up!

01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:03.266
Oh, God.
Did not need that.

01:44:03.268 --> 01:44:05.735
Could you zap me with
that forgetting thing, please?

01:44:05.737 --> 01:44:07.470
What are you doing here,
Pawny?

01:44:07.472 --> 01:44:08.974
Get used to seeing me,
pretty boy.

01:44:09.207 --> 01:44:11.308
- I'm your new babysitter.
- He's my new what?

01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:12.843
- Babysitter.
- Queen's orders.

01:44:12.845 --> 01:44:14.710
She says the chance
of your sorry ass

01:44:14.712 --> 01:44:16.647
surviving without me:
Zero.

01:44:16.649 --> 01:44:18.714
Okay, I did not say that...
exactly.

01:44:18.716 --> 01:44:20.317
She said, "Slim to zero."

01:44:20.319 --> 01:44:21.584
I rounded it down to zero

01:44:21.586 --> 01:44:22.988
because
I feel like it's zero.

01:44:23.221 --> 01:44:24.687
Consider it a parting gift.

01:44:24.689 --> 01:44:26.456
Come on.
I saved the world.

01:44:26.458 --> 01:44:28.991
You couldn't tell because
you were getting choked out.

01:44:28.993 --> 01:44:30.794
- Do I even have a choice?
- No.

01:44:30.796 --> 01:44:33.763
Yes! There we go. All right.
Where's that little red button?

01:44:33.765 --> 01:44:34.930
Oh, it's right here.

01:44:34.932 --> 01:44:36.299
Whoa!

01:44:36.301 --> 01:44:37.800
I still don't like you.

01:44:37.802 --> 01:44:38.902
I love that option.

01:44:45.944 --> 01:44:48.745
This is a complicated piece
of machinery, so be careful.

01:44:48.747 --> 01:44:49.946
Yeah, got it.

01:44:49.948 --> 01:44:51.384
I'm gonna trust my gut.

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:05.761
