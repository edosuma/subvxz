00:01.000 --> 00:02.866
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:02.936 --> 00:06.564
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.673 --> 00:07.833
In New York City,

00:07.907 --> 00:10.808
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.877 --> 00:14.404
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.481 --> 00:16.449
These are their stories,

00:18.985 --> 00:20.816
DOCTOR: Mandibular
and orbital fractures.

00:20.887 --> 00:24.050
BIunt-force trauma
to the back of the head
and Ioss of consciousness.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.922
Five-centimeter
knife Iaceration
below the right clavicle.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.961
He wanted to disfigure her.
And kill her.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.520
DOCTOR: Nearly succeeded, too.
I'm surprised she survived.

00:31.598 --> 00:34.226
Radio car found her outside
a warehouse in Chinatown.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.665
Responding to a burglar alarm.

00:35.735 --> 00:36.861
DOCTOR: Lucky for her.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.096
Yeah, Iucky.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.399
What else?

00:39.472 --> 00:42.270
Distinct fingerprint bruising
above her knees, and these.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.503
Burns,
Iikely from a cigarette.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.512
Maybe abuse,
but it's a strange pattern.

00:47.580 --> 00:48.740
This might interest you.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.548
Maybe a gang member.

00:52.619 --> 00:53.643
BENSON: Rape kit?

00:53.720 --> 00:57.554
PIenty of fluids, all tainted.
Used some kind of
cleaning solution.

00:57.624 --> 01:00.752
Smelled Iike bleach.
She'II be out of it
for a while.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.089
You won't get anything
tonight.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.720
Okay. Thanks.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.891
She's gonna
have plates in her face
for the rest of her Iife.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.490
A Iot of rage.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.398
BIeach. Guy's meticulous.

01:11.471 --> 01:12.768
And confident.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.771
Squad guys took these.

01:14.941 --> 01:18.274
AIIey where they found her,
full view of the street.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.977
So we got a burglary
and a rape in close proximity.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.677
Maybe a dump job.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.547
You believe in coincidences?

02:14.467 --> 02:17.027
According to Robbery,
the perps broke into
the warehouse

02:17.103 --> 02:20.470
and made out with 50 grand
in these, high-speed
computer processors.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.873
Five masked men, they jumped
the janitor and Iocked him
in the utility closet.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.137
This is the only exit.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.441
Leading to our second
crime scene.

02:27.514 --> 02:31.473
STABLER: Victim is Helen Chen,
19. She Iives a few blocks
down on Hester.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.985
This is where the uniform
found her.

02:34.053 --> 02:36.817
Among a whole bunch of
computer parts, probably
dropped on the way out.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.221
Burglary alarm was silent.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.021
By the time the patrol car
got here, she was
the only one here.

02:41.094 --> 02:44.029
You got five guys in
the warehouse. Maybe a sixth
out here to commit the rape.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.462
Or we're talking two crimes.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.160
Either way, robbery perps
had to see her on the way out.

02:48.234 --> 02:51.328
Our best Iead is a possible
gang tattoo on her shoulder.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.201
Women aren't members
of Asian gangs.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.538
They're associates
through a brother
or boyfriend.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.304
They use them
to carry drugs and guns.

02:58.378 --> 02:59.845
Women are Iess Iikely
to get hassled by cops.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.710
Well, so far our only witness
is the victim.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.908
We'II hit the hospital,
see what she has to say.

03:03.983 --> 03:05.712
The body art suggests
she associates

03:05.785 --> 03:08.253
with some of the more unsavory
elements in society.

03:08.321 --> 03:12.189
I got a guy down in
Gang Intel. He's probably
seen every tat in town.

03:16.629 --> 03:20.565
Tattoos, cigarette burns,
all could indicate
Chinese gang activity,

03:20.633 --> 03:22.999
but they signify
different things.

03:23.069 --> 03:27.904
The burns could mean
initiation, number of kills,
punishment.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.868
What's this mean?

03:31.611 --> 03:33.078
Could be Chinese gang.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.443
Define "could be."

03:34.514 --> 03:37.642
Well, a Iot of Chinese gang
tattoos use versions of snakes
or dragons,

03:37.717 --> 03:39.309
but I haven't seen
this one before.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.910
For gang intelligence,
you don't have many answers.

03:41.988 --> 03:45.014
Look, I worked two years
in Chinatown undercover.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.025
I barely scratched
the surface.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.789
You think you'II get somewhere
with a rape investigation?

03:49.862 --> 03:51.727
Chinatown's got no Iove
for cops.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.561
Well, they're just gonna
have to get over that.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.101
What's your take
on the warehouse robbery?

03:56.169 --> 03:58.967
Computer parts heist
does sound Iike Asian gang
activity.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.871
We've been building cases
against several gangs
of high-tech crime.

04:01.941 --> 04:05.001
Same profit margin
as drug trafficking,
nowhere near the jail time.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.478
Only question is,
where does this rape fit in?

04:07.547 --> 04:10.414
A Iot of Asian gangs use rape
as a form of punishment.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.917
Maybe your victim
broke the rules.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.077
Helen, we're trying to
find out who did this to you.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.646
So, when you're able,
we'd Iike to talk to
you about it.

04:18.725 --> 04:19.817
Don't make her cry.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.326
She starts to choke
and they have to snap
her jaw open again.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.420
I told you, she can't talk.

04:24.497 --> 04:27.591
Yeah, but you can, Johnny.
Come here. Come here.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.105
Okay. What was your sister
doing in that alley?

04:34.173 --> 04:35.162
(GRUNTING)

04:35.241 --> 04:37.334
I don't know. Walking home.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.911
What happened to your arm?
I burned it.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.949
Yeah, with a Iaser
to remove a gang tattoo.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.006
I'm not in a group.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.678
So it's just Helen?
She rob the warehouse?

04:49.222 --> 04:53.556
I used to be with a group.
Ghost Shadows.
But I got out a Iong time ago.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.854
What about your sister?

04:54.927 --> 04:57.794
She's still in,
with her yue nan boyfriend.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.798
And what's that?
What's yue nan?

04:59.866 --> 05:03.825
Vietnamese. Dao Tran.
He's the one banging.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.334
Last week, I told him
to stay away from Helen.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.466
Punk said he'd kill me
if I got in between them.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.443
She thinks she can
protect him. Not anymore.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.580
I should've made sure
he stayed away from her
permanently.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.275
Dao Tran's boys
hit that warehouse.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.183
Well, how do you know
if you're out? Maybe it was
one of your old friends.

05:20.253 --> 05:23.017
Try this on. It was your boys
who robbed the warehouse,

05:23.089 --> 05:25.887
and then they rape the sister
of the guy
who turns his back on them.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.188
Ghost Shadows didn't do this.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.524
They know I'd kill anybody
who tried to hurt her.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.462
(HELEN GRUNTING)

05:33.566 --> 05:36.399
So where can we find
this Dao Tran?

05:37.570 --> 05:41.700
Pho Hoa Restaurant on Canal.
AII the Born to Kill boys
hang there.

05:42.642 --> 05:43.973
Born to Kill?

05:44.043 --> 05:45.635
Yeah. From Vietnam War.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.804
It's what the American
soldiers used to write
on their helmets.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.744
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

05:52.819 --> 05:54.480
HOSTESS: We closed now.
Come back Iater.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.681
BENSON: Where's Dao Tran?
Not here.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.481
Good afternoon, boys.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.856
Kind of early to be out
of school. What, you all sick?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.758
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

06:03.162 --> 06:04.424
Let's take their temperature.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.486
No trouble now.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.294
You're closed, we heard.

06:09.001 --> 06:10.195
Hey, wait.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.497
Hey!

06:17.677 --> 06:21.408
See how messy things can get
when you don't cooperate, Dao?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.743
How's your Iove Iife, Dao?

06:28.755 --> 06:30.689
I hear you and Helen Chen
have been dating.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.054
We broke up.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.390
Why? She doesn't Iike
being burned with cigarettes?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.658
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.198
Kind of Iike you don't know
Helen's in the hospital?

06:40.266 --> 06:41.460
What happened?

06:41.534 --> 06:45.061
STABLER:
She was raped and beaten
and Ieft in an alley for dead.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.400
God, no.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.269
Why don't we stop
with the performance, Dao?

06:48.341 --> 06:50.605
I swear. We haven't
seen each other for a week.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.945
We wanted people to think
we weren't together anymore.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.173
People? Like your boys
in Born to Kill?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.772
Now we know
her brother's in a gang.

06:56.849 --> 07:00.285
Maybe your boys didn't Iike
you dating a Chinese girl.

07:02.021 --> 07:04.148
They jumped her
to teach you a Iesson?
No.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.350
Or maybe it had nothing
to do with them.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.553
Johnny Chen said that you're
not good enough for Helen.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.255
He embarrassed you,
made you feel stupid.

07:10.329 --> 07:13.321
But you're not stupid.
You're a smart guy, right?

07:13.399 --> 07:15.629
You raped her
while your friends
robbed the warehouse.

07:15.701 --> 07:19.330
I didn't rape Helen.
I Iove her.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.371
Ghost Shadows
did the warehouse.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.970
BENSON: How do you know?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.671
Helen told me.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.381
She was their Iookout.

07:33.052 --> 07:34.849
I tried to stop her.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.149
Johnny did this.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.592
So you want us to believe
that her own brother
raped her.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.426
He ordered it.
Prove it.

07:45.498 --> 07:50.094
Look, Helen didn't want to
bang with him, but he's got
this control over her.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.137
I mean, you know those
burn marks on her arm?

07:52.205 --> 07:55.333
Well, Johnny made her
do that to herself,
because of me.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.371
Johnny did this.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.502
Okay.

07:59.579 --> 08:04.642
Well, it's still
your word against his.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.845
Ask Helen.
She knows what he can do.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.324
STABLER: Helen,
we can't help you if you're
protecting your brother.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.452
Now, we know he's involved
in your attack.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.757
That's not true.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.491
BENSON: Well,
then tell us what is.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.466
'Cause right now
our best suspect is Dao Tran.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.526
No, it's not Dao. He Ioves me.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.538
STABLER: Well, your brother
made you burn your arm.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.733
You think he cares
what happens to you?

08:31.110 --> 08:32.702
Did you see him?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.575
I don't remember.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.952
I got hit. Passed out.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.283
Johnny must have seen you
when he robbed that warehouse.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.192
He was going to Iet you die
in that alley.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.252
It wasn't him.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.527
STABLER: Well, it may
have been one of his crew.

08:54.901 --> 08:58.530
Helen, tell us where he is.
Come on.

09:04.944 --> 09:09.677
They have a house,
where they keep scores.

09:17.857 --> 09:21.020
Get off me, man. Get off me.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.420
That's our grieving brother
right there.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.965
Look who it is,
Mister Intelligence.
Our friend from Gang Intel.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.399
It's not what it Iooks Iike.
BENSON:
Looks Iike a bust to me.

09:29.468 --> 09:30.696
Thanks to our rape victim.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.102
You knew her tattoo
meant Ghost Shadows
and you Iied about it.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.298
Look, I couldn't tell you.

09:34.373 --> 09:36.398
We had a 15-month
investigation riding on this.

09:36.475 --> 09:37.703
You're talking about
stolen property,

09:37.777 --> 09:39.301
we're talking about a girl
that was brutalized.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.642
Are we going to debate now
about whose job
is more important?

09:41.714 --> 09:44.706
No, we're gonna debate
about you helping
our guy get away with rape.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.217
You're Iooking at Johnny Chen
for this, right?

09:46.285 --> 09:47.616
He knows who raped her.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.120
He's yours. Hey.

09:49.488 --> 09:50.477
With our gratitude.

09:50.556 --> 09:51.716
Thanks.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.397
I didn't do nothing.
I provide for Helen.
I take care of her.

09:58.464 --> 10:00.056
Did you provide for her
to get raped?

10:00.132 --> 10:01.690
No. Never.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.736
Well, robbery places you
at the scene
of her attack there, Johnny.

10:04.804 --> 10:05.930
Do you want to go down
for this?

10:06.005 --> 10:08.405
You want to go down for raping
and beating your own sister?

10:10.309 --> 10:12.539
When we went in, she was okay.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.110
Okay.

10:21.387 --> 10:22.684
And when you came out?

10:24.490 --> 10:27.857
I didn't see her. Thought
she got scared and ran off.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.456
But then...

10:29.528 --> 10:30.961
STABLER: But then what?

10:31.831 --> 10:33.093
I found her.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.159
I thought you said
you didn't see her.

10:35.234 --> 10:40.035
I found her and then she was
so beat up. Nobody was around.

10:40.106 --> 10:45.169
We heard sirens.
Then it got so crazy,
and she Iooked dead.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.237
So you saved your own ass.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.844
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

10:53.586 --> 10:54.951
CRAGEN: Detectives?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.756
BIeach man is back.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.665
When?
Half an hour ago in Chinatown.

11:06.732 --> 11:07.756
The victim get a good Iook?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.323
She's dead.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.801
Victim's Asian?

11:15.875 --> 11:17.502
From what I can tell,
it's your guy.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.708
BIeach to clean up, beat her
around the face and head.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.645
He's getting a Iot more
enthusiastic.

11:22.715 --> 11:26.082
But still had the presence
of mind to get rid of his DNA.

11:26.152 --> 11:27.744
Not necessarily.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.049
BENSON: BIood under
the fingernails.
She fought back.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.524
OFFICER: Must've made him
pretty angry.

11:35.294 --> 11:36.989
Imagine carving
someone's body.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.864
I'm gonna guess this slur
points to motive.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.430
He's a racist.

11:46.472 --> 11:49.373
Her name was Lucy Zhang.
She was visiting her mother
in Chinatown.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.934
She cut across the park
to catch the six train
to the Upper East Side.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.070
CRAGEN: Gang connections?

11:54.146 --> 11:56.444
Nothing.
She was a CPA, no record.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.785
The ME thinks that the racial
epithet was cut postmortem

11:59.852 --> 12:01.911
with a straight blade
from a utility knife.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.423
Nothing Iike this M.O.
in our 61s.
We're back where we started.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.751
Then we need a new profile.

12:08.828 --> 12:12.286
The brutality indicates
a tremendous amount of anger
towards Asian women.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.798
Probably was victimized
by Asians at some point.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.960
It took time and effort
to cut up the victim
Iike that.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.334
He's confident enough
to believe he's not
gonna get caught.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.895
Yeah, but he wasn't always.

12:20.973 --> 12:24.136
A search through the past
few years should reveal
smaller acts of aggression.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.770
Peeping, exposure, violence
with consensual partners,

12:26.846 --> 12:27.972
up to outright assaults.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.139
An awful Iot of ground
to cover.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.443
CRAGEN: Maybe not.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.108
I'II call the bias task force.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.676
Have them send over files
on hate crimes
against Asian women.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.045
CRAGEN: Anything?

12:37.123 --> 12:40.684
Just reams of complaints
about racist scum. Haven't
ruled out anybody so far.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.388
Year ago, a peeping Tom
was hitting Chinatown.

12:43.462 --> 12:47.193
Could be our guy, but he was
good at it, ran away
before anybody could see him.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.700
Girl got shoved
on East Broadway
five months ago,

12:49.769 --> 12:50.997
perp threw out a racial slur.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.368
No description,
then he disappeared
into the crowd.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.565
What is this guy, invisible?

12:54.640 --> 12:56.801
Nothing on the blood
from under the victim's nails?

12:56.876 --> 12:58.309
STABLER:
Still waiting on serology.

12:58.377 --> 13:01.039
For someone careful enough
to clean up his evidence
with bleach,

13:01.113 --> 13:04.810
he's careless to Ieave behind
his own blood.
His rage may be escalating.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.613
Still doesn't help us
if he's not in the database.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.050
BENSON:
AII right, Iisten to this.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.079
A woman answered a personal ad
in a Chinese-Ianguage
newspaper.

13:12.324 --> 13:16.124
Guy pulled a utility knife
on the first date. She dropped
the complaint the next day.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.560
Got scared.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.088
Let's go.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.066
Could take hours
to track down a translator.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.692
Doc, can you translate?

13:23.769 --> 13:26.067
What, you just assume
I speak Chinese?

13:26.138 --> 13:28.663
No. I heard you order
take-out once.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.876
Sonja came from China Iast
summer to Iive with her aunt.

13:36.949 --> 13:38.280
She didn't know anyone.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.342
She decided to meet people
through personals
in the China Sun,

13:41.520 --> 13:43.283
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

13:50.296 --> 13:52.662
I wrote him a Ietter.
He wrote back right away.

13:52.731 --> 13:55.666
He said that he was a engineer
from Beijing.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.264
We wrote three or four times
a week. He sounded
as Ionely as I was.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.364
How did they arrange to meet?

14:02.441 --> 14:04.033
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

14:07.546 --> 14:10.276
We were going to have dinner
at a restaurant close by.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.317
But when I arrived,
it was all Iies.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.123
What does that mean, all Iies?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.121
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

14:27.533 --> 14:29.660
She says he wasn't Chinese.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.726
He was black.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.200
How many African-American
males speak and write
Chinese well enough

14:36.275 --> 14:38.004
to fool a native speaker?

14:38.277 --> 14:42.077
Well, he could be a student
or work at the World Bank
or the UN or...

14:42.248 --> 14:43.875
Why Iie about being Chinese?

14:43.949 --> 14:46.474
Because he knows she'II never
go out with him if he's not,

14:46.552 --> 14:49.282
and then he expects
that once they've met,
she'II be so taken with him

14:49.355 --> 14:54.122
that his ethnicity
won't matter. Her reaction to
his race is what sets him off.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.954
The P.O. box he used
was a cash deal. Personal ad
was done over the phone.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.089
He used a stolen credit card.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.889
Let's follow the money.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.094
Sorry, I have a 4:00
at a brokerage house.

15:04.169 --> 15:07.605
I can't believe they're not
online trading yet.
I'm designing their website.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.504
Mr. Tang, how is it
a month went by

15:09.575 --> 15:11.475
before you realized
your credit card was stolen?

15:11.543 --> 15:12.601
Yeah, that sucked.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.509
Well, I was in Paris
and then Bern.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.707
They're dying for HTML
speakers out there,

15:16.782 --> 15:19.273
and I get back and there's
all these random charges.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.410
Do you have any idea
who might have stolen it?

15:21.487 --> 15:24.047
I wish. It was the week
I went out of town.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.421
I was just kind of crazy,
so I guess
I just Ieft it somewhere.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.857
Not too worried about money,
I guess.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.021
Well, the credit card company
was cool.
They didn't make me pay.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.324
Some weird charges, though.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.389
I mean, whoever took it
probably didn't want his wife
to know.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.558
Why? What do you mean?

15:35.634 --> 15:38.262
Well, the guy was definitely
getting some action.

15:38.337 --> 15:42.467
I have the statement
right here.
Look, China Girl, 200 bucks.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.505
Massage parlor in Chinatown.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.671
Where no one actually
gets a massage.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.076
Police.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.177
I'II need to see
a search warrant.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.311
Just calm down.
We're not Vice. We're not INS.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.252
We're Iooking for
one of your customers.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.622
I maintain the strictest
confidentiality policy
with our clients.

16:00.693 --> 16:04.129
That's great.
Now, if you want a raid here,
I can arrange that.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.535
We're Iooking for a man
that came in here
about two weeks ago.

16:12.604 --> 16:16.597
African-American.
He used a credit card
with the name Larry Tang.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.473
Come on, now.
Receipts. Give it up.

16:20.546 --> 16:24.448
No need. I remember this guy.
He tried to kill
one of my girls.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.014
Hey.
STABLER: Sorry to interrupt.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.992
Jiang Li? We'd Iike to
have a word with you.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.530
Can you tell us about the man
who attacked you?

16:44.436 --> 16:47.428
Looked young, Iike 20s.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.533
Nothing special about him.

16:50.609 --> 16:53.669
Came in for a massage.
Didn't Iike it, I guess.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.345
We're not Iooking
to set you up.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.617
Just tell us the truth.
It stays right here.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.584
He said he wanted
a girlfriend.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.685
Don't understand why
the racist son of a bitch
came to Chinatown.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.590
He paid you
to be his girlfriend?

17:10.996 --> 17:13.328
It was fine,
just regular stuff.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.826
Except he couldn't do it.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.733
I don't know,
I guess I Iaughed.

17:19.838 --> 17:22.636
I didn't mean anything.
He got mad.

17:25.243 --> 17:28.645
Tells me he want to tie me up.
Sometimes I do that.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.942
But this guy,
I had a bad feeling.
So I said no.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.610
BENSON: Did he hurt you?

17:36.488 --> 17:38.513
Punched me a couple times.

17:39.691 --> 17:42.182
Pull out this
Iittle army knife.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.855
Call me names.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.792
What did he do with the knife?

17:58.877 --> 18:01.311
Do you think
you could describe him
to a sketch artist?

18:04.416 --> 18:08.318
Faxed the sketch to area
schools with Chinese Ianguage
programs. Zero.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.718
Nothing door-to-door, either.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.221
So what are we missing?

18:11.290 --> 18:14.350
I mean, here's a guy
who immerses himself
into another culture.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.623
Masters the Ianguage,
Iies about his own ethnicity.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.961
Then destroys the very culture
that he's imitated. Why?

18:21.033 --> 18:23.593
He's chosen a culture
that's traditionally insular,

18:23.669 --> 18:26.160
particularly among
the older generation.

18:26.238 --> 18:30.937
I know that if my sister dated
a black man, my parents
would've strongly objected.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.745
So this guy puts himself
in a position to get rejected,

18:34.813 --> 18:37.441
not only as a man,
but as a non-Asian.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.176
It's Iike he wants an excuse
to get mad.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.480
Very possibly.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.989
None of which helps
if we're working off
a bad sketch.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.660
Got a hit on the DNA
from under the victim's nails.
African-American.

18:48.727 --> 18:52.322
Sent up on multiple rape
and homicide. Just released
from CIinton Iast year.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.160
So where is he now?

18:57.603 --> 18:59.264
STABLER:
Where can we find him?

18:59.338 --> 19:00.464
That's Starnes.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.532
BENSON: What's wrong with him?

19:03.609 --> 19:07.306
Progressive MS.
This is a halfway house
for men with disabilities.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.370
He's been pretty bad off
for a few years now.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.938
Mistake at the Iab?

19:11.016 --> 19:12.108
Maybe.

19:13.552 --> 19:17.511
Mr. Starnes,
we're investigating a series
of rapes in Chinatown.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.791
I ain't helping no cops.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.861
But your DNA was all over
one of the victims,
and she's dead.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.828
So maybe you want to help
yourself.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.627
I can't even get out
of this chair, boy.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.428
And if I could, it wouldn't be
to get with no downtown bitch.

19:34.439 --> 19:37.067
You got any brothers,
cousins around?

19:37.376 --> 19:39.970
Someone who might
want to set you up?

19:43.916 --> 19:47.113
Mr. Starnes,
do you have any children?

19:48.687 --> 19:52.123
Never had the pleasure.
You offering?

19:52.958 --> 19:54.391
You've raped a Iot of women.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.393
So it's possible
that you have kids out there

19:56.461 --> 19:58.622
that you don't even
know about, right?

19:58.697 --> 20:00.426
I suppose so, Iady.

20:07.739 --> 20:10.230
PCR typing only Iooked
at 10 genetic markers.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.869
Sometimes a person can have
a close enough match

20:12.945 --> 20:14.913
to score a hit
within the database.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.345
Can you do another test?

20:16.415 --> 20:19.248
I ran a Y-chromosome
on Starnes and the perp.

20:19.318 --> 20:23.220
The Y-chromosome is passed
from father to son
within a family Iine.

20:23.288 --> 20:28.590
Grandfathers, fathers,
brothers, sons, nephews will
have virtually identical Ys.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.828
There's no doubt about it.
These guys
are blood relatives.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.660
Well, Halfway House
and prison records

20:33.732 --> 20:36.132
says that Starnes has
no Iiving male relative.

20:36.201 --> 20:39.659
That we know of.
He's a rapist. Our perp
could be this guy's son.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.172
Makes sense.
Their DNA is similar.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.740
Well, I guess
being a psychopath
runs in the family.

20:46.078 --> 20:51.448
Vital statistics confirm
Starnes was not named on any
birth certificate as a father.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.074
So we're Ieft with
his victims.

20:53.151 --> 20:54.812
Starnes got sent up
on four rapes.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.446
We ran the victims' names.
One came back. Martha Shelby.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.184
Had a child that fits
the timeframe,
no father Iisted.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.954
AII right, Iet's find her.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.188
Now what about victims
they couldn't pin on him?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.527
He Iooked good for three
unsolved rapes in Harlem,

21:06.598 --> 21:08.964
but none of the victims
had a child
within nine months.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.626
AII right, keep Iooking.
What else?

21:10.702 --> 21:13.899
Starnes had a Iive-in
girlfriend that alibied him
on a couple of collars.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.270
Pamela Tatum. She had a baby
while they were
Iiving together.

21:16.341 --> 21:19.868
There's no father
on the birth certificate.
He'd be 23 now.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.005
He's old enough
to be a suspect.
Track him and the mother down.

21:23.081 --> 21:26.573
What's the odds that
both the father and son
turn out to be rapists?

21:26.652 --> 21:29.314
You know,
some geneticists theorize
that violence is inherited.

21:29.388 --> 21:32.789
Oh, that's right.
It's not my fault,
I was just born to kill.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.155
It's a theory.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.716
Well, it's ridiculous.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.592
It's another way for people
not to take responsibility
for their actions.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.359
Let's find the guy first.

21:40.432 --> 21:43.424
We can discuss
the Human Genome Project
Iater.

21:47.606 --> 21:48.595
You all right?

21:48.674 --> 21:50.073
Yeah. Let's go.

21:53.845 --> 21:57.303
Been a Iong time
since anybody's asked me
about Daniel.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.574
I was 17 when I was raped.

21:59.718 --> 22:02.278
Three months Iater,
doctor told me I was pregnant.

22:02.354 --> 22:03.912
I didn't know what to do.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.787
According to the birth
certificate, you kept him.

22:06.858 --> 22:10.919
I didn't think I could handle
an abortion. But in the end
it didn't matter.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.328
What do you mean?

22:13.398 --> 22:17.095
I went into Iabor two months
early. Daniel Iived two hours.

22:18.537 --> 22:21.995
I know this sounds awful,
but in a way Daniel's death
was a relief.

22:22.074 --> 22:26.636
I don't know that I could have
Iived with a constant reminder
of what happened to me.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.450
Thank you for your time.

22:38.156 --> 22:42.684
AII right. So now we go back
Iooking at rapes that Starnes
wasn't connected to.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.525
Unsolved rapes from
20 years ago. It should be
easy enough to crack.

22:45.597 --> 22:47.224
You got a better idea?

22:47.299 --> 22:49.460
Yeah,
Iet's continue to pretend
this isn't bothering you.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.331
EIIiot, knock it off.

22:54.139 --> 22:55.936
You're gonna tell me
what Professor Shelby
said in there,

22:56.007 --> 22:58.032
that's not getting to you?

22:59.211 --> 23:00.371
I'm a child of rape, EIIiot.

23:00.445 --> 23:03.380
I've known that
for a very Iong time,
and I appreciate your concern.

23:03.448 --> 23:04.779
I really do.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.683
But I've dealt with it.
So I'm fine.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.591
How'd I know that bastard
would come back to haunt me?

23:19.664 --> 23:20.688
How'd I know it?

23:20.766 --> 23:22.631
When's the Iast time
you seen Harold Starnes?

23:22.701 --> 23:26.762
Right before he got arrested.
Wised up and threw him out
finally.

23:26.872 --> 23:28.032
How Iong did you
Iive with him?

23:28.106 --> 23:29.573
Let him stay with me
two years,

23:29.641 --> 23:32.371
just after he got evicted
from that dump in FIatbush.

23:32.444 --> 23:33.638
Know how he thanks me?

23:33.712 --> 23:36.772
Rapes and kills my best friend
in my own building.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.281
Where was your son
at that time?

23:38.350 --> 23:41.183
I had Michael about a year
before I kicked Harry out.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.653
He didn't want much to do
with a baby anyway.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.485
Is Harry Michael's father?
Hell, no.

23:45.557 --> 23:46.615
Mind if I ask who is?

23:46.691 --> 23:48.750
That animal is not
Michael's father.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.920
But you were Iiving with him
when Michael was born.

23:50.996 --> 23:53.794
I had a Iot of boyfriends
back in the day,

23:53.865 --> 23:56.629
and if you trying to make me
feel Iike a whore,
forget about it.

23:56.701 --> 23:58.191
We're not trying to do that,
Miss Tatum.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.568
What you want to know
all this for?

24:00.639 --> 24:01.765
MUNCH:
DNA found at a crime scene.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.365
Looks Iike Starnes has a son
who may be following
in his footsteps.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.637
Know anything about it?

24:05.710 --> 24:07.041
You kidding me. No.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.410
Would you account
for your whereabouts
in the past few days?

24:09.481 --> 24:12.780
I was at my girlfriend's in DC
for the Iast two weeks.

24:12.851 --> 24:14.978
Just got back this morning.
AII right. That's enough.

24:15.053 --> 24:17.988
My son is not a rapist.
I want you to Ieave.

24:18.089 --> 24:19.351
Why don't you just
come with us?

24:19.424 --> 24:21.517
Take a few tests, and we can
clear this whole thing up.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.686
That man is not
Michael's father.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.730
But you don't know
for sure, do you?

24:25.797 --> 24:27.025
Get out.

24:27.866 --> 24:31.165
If you're innocent, you don't
have anything to hide.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.004
He fits the profile.
Could we compel a oral swab?

24:37.075 --> 24:39.339
It's worth a shot. Let's see
what Cabot has to say.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.469
Hey.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.848
Man, I didn't hurt anybody.
I swear.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.544
Then take the test.
It's real easy.

24:48.253 --> 24:51.518
Look, I know what Starnes did,
and I don't want to know
if I'm his son.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.387
There's no other way?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.025
Would you be willing
to stand in a Iineup?

24:57.095 --> 24:59.222
Yeah. Tell me when and where.

25:00.432 --> 25:03.230
We need an interpreter
to call in Sonja Yung
for the Iineup.

25:03.301 --> 25:05.496
Cancel it.
Michael Tatum's alibi cleared.

25:05.570 --> 25:08.095
He agreed to do it.
His mother Iived with Starnes
for two years.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.973
No, he's not our guy.
He was seen in DC
when the attacks occurred.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.977
Where are we
on unsolved rapes?

25:14.045 --> 25:17.173
Nowhere. We don't have
a known address
for Starnes before 1977.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.012
Which means he could've
been active anywhere.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.814
We got five boroughs'
worth of cold cases
to wade through.

25:21.887 --> 25:26.381
Not necessarily. Pamela Tatum
said that Starnes Iived
in FIatbush before Harlem.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.855
Police never Iooked at Starnes
for rapes in Brooklyn.

25:28.927 --> 25:32.090
Well, that sounds Iike a place
to start. Get the files.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.028
STABLER: Where's your son now?

25:37.102 --> 25:40.299
I don't know. Sometimes
Darrell doesn't come home.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.704
Thank you.

25:43.842 --> 25:49.940
Mrs. Guan, our records
indicate that you were
a victim of rape in 1977.

25:51.349 --> 25:52.407
Yes.

25:54.419 --> 25:56.853
Did you become pregnant
because of that rape?

25:56.922 --> 25:58.014
Why?

25:58.089 --> 26:01.388
We're investigating attacks
against Asian women
in the area.

26:01.459 --> 26:03.893
Here? That man is here?

26:04.062 --> 26:07.498
The man who attacked you will
spend the rest of his Iife
in a wheelchair.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.570
Was he Darrell's father?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.839
Yes.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.373
I found out I was pregnant,

26:19.444 --> 26:24.643
and I thought maybe something
good could come out
of what happened to me.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.410
Is this your son?

26:27.686 --> 26:29.551
His 21st birthday.

26:32.891 --> 26:34.256
Mrs. Guan,

26:35.126 --> 26:37.924
blood was found
at a murder scene
that may belong to Darrell.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.122
So we need to know
where he is.

26:39.197 --> 26:42.394
Darrell would never...
He's a good boy.

26:42.467 --> 26:43.661
We just want to talk with him.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.167
It's my fault.

26:54.913 --> 26:58.940
I had hoped that because
he was my son,
they would have Ioved him.

26:59.584 --> 27:00.642
BENSON: Who?

27:01.987 --> 27:06.083
My family.
Everyone in Chinatown.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.358
I moved in
with my mother and father
because I had no money.

27:13.164 --> 27:17.100
When they saw him,
they told me to give him away.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.697
He's half-devil, they said.

27:20.939 --> 27:26.434
The children in the
neighborhood would hurt him,
push him, kick him.

27:29.047 --> 27:34.041
Every day he'd cry, beg me
not to make him Ieave
the apartment.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.686
Why didn't you move away?

27:39.591 --> 27:42.025
I guess part of me hated him,
too.

27:48.533 --> 27:53.197
Have you seen anything that
makes you suspect Darrell's
done something wrong?

27:58.176 --> 28:00.303
That photo Iooks nothing
Iike the sketch of Darrell.

28:00.378 --> 28:02.471
Those victims had to have
known he was half-Asian.

28:02.547 --> 28:03.912
Why would they Iie?

28:03.982 --> 28:08.919
Look at this. Thrill Killing:
True Portrayals of America's
Most Vicious Murders,

28:08.987 --> 28:09.976
Hunting Human Beings,

28:10.055 --> 28:11.044
Might explain these.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.919
BIood?
Okay. We gotta get
CSU in here.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.652
Oh, my God.

28:14.726 --> 28:15.852
Where is he?

28:20.365 --> 28:22.356
BENSON: Excuse me,
is Darrell Guan here?

28:22.434 --> 28:24.299
No, he's on deliveries.
Be back in an hour.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.803
We'II need to see those
addresses now.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.532
Won't take me a minute.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.164
Should've known
Darrell was up to something.

28:30.241 --> 28:32.004
Why?
Well, a couple of women
complained.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.066
Kept asking them out.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.236
Are all your customers
in the computer?

28:34.312 --> 28:35.802
Yeah.
May I?

28:41.486 --> 28:42.976
STABLER: Find anything?

28:43.254 --> 28:45.552
Helen Chen and Lucy Zhang's
mother are both in here.

28:45.623 --> 28:47.955
AIong with their
home addresses.

28:48.293 --> 28:50.454
Victim's address
at the touch of a button.

28:50.528 --> 28:51.859
Call for back up.

28:58.703 --> 29:00.193
(BELL RINGING)

29:18.356 --> 29:19.846
Darrell, stop.

29:20.658 --> 29:21.852
Police!

29:22.260 --> 29:23.727
Stop! Police!

29:25.563 --> 29:28.498
Freeze. Police!
Okay. I didn't do anything.

29:32.704 --> 29:35.901
Liv. AII right, we got him.
We got him, we got him.

29:39.177 --> 29:40.542
STABLER: You got it?

29:43.948 --> 29:45.415
What is it?

29:46.417 --> 29:47.816
It's bleach.

29:55.693 --> 29:58.161
Counselor,
I'm glad I ran into you.

29:58.229 --> 30:02.097
Expect an updated witness Iist
on the Guan case
by the end of the week.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.064
You're representing
Darrell Guan?

30:04.135 --> 30:07.127
Little below your usual
tax bracket requirement,
isn't he, Margo?

30:07.205 --> 30:09.571
I'm defending him pro bono.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.699
Looking for headlines.

30:10.775 --> 30:14.472
Looking to save a Iife.
Keep the death penalty
off the table.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.777
Your client
planned his attacks
and tried to cover his crimes.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.339
He intentionally
selected his victims

30:19.417 --> 30:21.977
based on race,
national origin,
ancestry and gender.

30:22.053 --> 30:24.578
That's five
of the nine criteria
under the Hate Crimes Act,

30:24.656 --> 30:26.317
which is an automatic
sentence enhancement.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.583
He's not guilty of murder one.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.151
The victim's blood was found
on Darrell's clothing.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.254
His DNA was found under
one of the victim's nails.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.095
The bottle of bleach used
in both crime scenes
was found in his possession.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.965
What exactly is
your definition of guilt?

30:39.103 --> 30:42.561
Guilt, noun.
From the Middle English
G-I-L-T.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.803
The fact of being responsible
for the commission
of an offense.

30:45.877 --> 30:48.368
Operative word being
"responsible."

30:49.147 --> 30:52.310
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

30:53.484 --> 30:56.180
My parents made me
read the dictionary.

30:59.924 --> 31:02.620
Margo Nelson's got
a PhD in molecular biology,

31:02.694 --> 31:03.922
in addition to her Iaw degree.

31:03.995 --> 31:06.054
So what the hell is she doing
defending a rapist?

31:06.130 --> 31:08.325
Trying to set a precedent,
I think.
Look at her witnesses.

31:08.399 --> 31:10.833
A geneticist, a biologist,
a genetic psychologist.

31:10.902 --> 31:12.460
AII for an insanity defense.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.028
Not guilty by reason
of DNA. PIease.

31:15.173 --> 31:18.665
She's trying to get the State
to pay for genetic testing
on Guan and Harold Starnes.

31:18.743 --> 31:21.211
Prove the sins of the father
are visited on the son.

31:21.279 --> 31:22.576
Wait, wait, wait.

31:22.647 --> 31:27.311
The Frye standard
precludes scientific evidence

31:27.385 --> 31:30.047
not generally accepted
by the scientific community.

31:30.121 --> 31:33.716
So file a motion in Iimine.
Just keep it out.

31:33.791 --> 31:36.624
I'm not sure that I can.
Nelson's got science
on her side.

31:36.694 --> 31:39.219
It's a generally accepted
theory that violence
and genes are Iinked.

31:39.297 --> 31:41.288
They're Iinked, not causative.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.857
Do you trust a jury to make
that distinction? I don't.

31:43.935 --> 31:46.495
It's your job to make sure
that they can.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.129
I've got George Huang
doing a psych exam.

31:48.206 --> 31:51.573
Hopefully, he can prove
Darrell knew exactly
what he was doing.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.168
Listen to me,
if Nelson pulls this off,

31:54.245 --> 31:56.679
it's a Pandora's box
for criminal prosecution,

31:56.748 --> 32:00.684
because everything can be
blamed on the confluence
of bad genes.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.243
And then no one
is truly responsible
for their own actions.

32:03.321 --> 32:04.481
That's what I'm afraid of.

32:04.555 --> 32:07.046
Good,
then don't Iet it happen.

32:13.197 --> 32:14.892
Do you know why I'm here,
Darrell?

32:14.966 --> 32:16.456
To see if I'm crazy.

32:16.534 --> 32:21.301
To see if you're competent
to stand trial. Why? Do you
think that you're crazy?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.772
If I say no, I get
the death penalty, right?

32:24.842 --> 32:27.868
Usually the Iawyers Iet me
make the diagnosis,
not the defendant.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.176
But I'm just wondering
what you think.

32:31.249 --> 32:32.773
You're Chinese.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.941
Why, yes, I am.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.516
So am I.

32:40.558 --> 32:43.391
Actually, you're half-Chinese,
aren't you?

32:47.732 --> 32:49.563
You're tow gee,

32:51.369 --> 32:54.896
You think that
I'm the privileged
and spoiled Iandowner?

32:55.006 --> 32:58.703
Isn't that what
the native Chinese call
the American-born Chinese?

32:58.776 --> 33:01.711
But you're American-born
as well, aren't you?

33:04.182 --> 33:07.083
Was it difficult for you
growing up in Chinatown?

33:07.151 --> 33:08.140
No.

33:08.219 --> 33:09.516
You speak the Ianguage
very well.

33:09.587 --> 33:12.078
You know the customs
probably better than I do.

33:12.156 --> 33:16.490
But I imagine for many people
in Chinatown,
you were still an outcast.

33:16.561 --> 33:17.653
Didn't bother me.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.822
The kids probably
picked on you
when you were growing up.

33:19.897 --> 33:20.955
That must have been difficult.

33:21.032 --> 33:24.092
Even your own family
must have treated you
differently.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.993
What do you know
about your father?

33:28.473 --> 33:29.667
Enough.

33:29.807 --> 33:32.298
How old were you
when you found out
that he'd raped your mom?

33:32.377 --> 33:35.676
I don't remember. Young.
My mother's mother told me.

33:36.414 --> 33:37.938
Why did she tell you that?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.108
Haak gwai,

33:39.917 --> 33:42.784
BIack devil.
She called you that?

33:44.322 --> 33:45.983
It doesn't matter.

33:49.193 --> 33:52.060
What about your father?
How do you feel
about your father?

33:57.802 --> 33:59.827
I'm nothing Iike him.

34:00.838 --> 34:03.272
Look at what you've done,
Darrell.

34:03.341 --> 34:05.901
Your whole Iife you've tried
not to be Iike him.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.502
But you're violent.
You hurt people.

34:08.646 --> 34:11.706
You rape them.
Like father, Iike son.

34:18.822 --> 34:20.051
Get out!

34:21.059 --> 34:23.789
MAN: Darrell, calm down.
Take it easy.

34:24.094 --> 34:26.427
Okay, okay, okay.
Take it easy.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.063
Gee, okay.

34:32.670 --> 34:37.369
Have you discovered
what some theorists term
the "violence gene"?

34:37.909 --> 34:41.242
Well, there is no
"violence gene" per se,

34:41.312 --> 34:45.476
and violent behavior can be
Iinked to the expression
of several abnormal genes.

34:45.550 --> 34:46.641
For instance?

34:46.717 --> 34:51.949
A defective DRD2 A1 allele
may Iead to pleasure-seeking

34:52.023 --> 34:55.424
or addictive behavior,
as well as violence.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.218
You conducted several
DNA tests on Mr. Guan.

34:59.297 --> 35:02.164
Does he suffer from this
particular gene abnormality?

35:02.233 --> 35:03.257
Yes, he does.

35:03.334 --> 35:06.132
And what about his biological
father, Harold Starnes?

35:06.204 --> 35:09.105
He suffers from
the exact same abnormality.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.673
Mr. Starnes
is a convicted rapist.

35:11.742 --> 35:15.974
Would you say that his son
inherited these violent
tendencies from his father?

35:16.047 --> 35:18.709
Objection. No matter
how much research
Dr. Coffey has done,

35:18.783 --> 35:20.683
he cannot definitively
answer that question.

35:20.751 --> 35:25.154
I agree. Let's try and keep it
out of the realm of science
fiction, Miss Nelson.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.425
Are gene mutations inherited,
Dr. Coffey?

35:28.493 --> 35:29.983
Certainly they can be.

35:30.061 --> 35:34.964
I mean, take for instance
the genetic disease
cystic fibrosis.

35:35.199 --> 35:38.862
Both parents must possess
the recessive gene
and pass it on to the child

35:38.970 --> 35:40.904
in order for the child
to have the illness.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.669
If they don't have the gene,
the child will not get
the illness.

35:44.742 --> 35:49.111
Would a person with cystic
fibrosis have any control
over contracting the disease?

35:49.180 --> 35:52.445
No. He will have inherited
the gene at conception.

35:52.517 --> 35:56.180
And Iike that disease,
if a child inherited genes
that made him violent,

35:56.254 --> 35:59.189
he wouldn't have any control
over that either, correct?

35:59.257 --> 36:00.315
That's correct.

36:00.391 --> 36:05.590
So from a genetic standpoint,
since Harold Starnes
was a violent man,

36:06.664 --> 36:09.394
it's not completely out
of the realm of possibility

36:09.467 --> 36:11.901
that his son was born violent,
as well.

36:11.969 --> 36:15.370
Objection. How did we go from
talking about inherited genes
to inherited behavior?

36:15.439 --> 36:17.373
I apologize.
I'II try to speak slowly

36:17.441 --> 36:19.773
and use smaller words
so you can keep up with us.

36:19.844 --> 36:20.936
RIDENOUR: Counselor.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.140
Dr. Coffey has not
specifically proven
inherited behavior.

36:24.215 --> 36:26.547
Are we just going to
make up new theories
as we go along?

36:26.617 --> 36:30.075
No, I think it's better that
we take the word of an
assistant district attorney

36:30.154 --> 36:31.815
over that
of a scientific expert.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.790
Objection sustained.
Move it along, Miss Nelson.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.986
Nothing further, Your Honor.

36:38.963 --> 36:43.400
Are all people with
a defective DRD2 A1
allele rapists, Dr. Coffey?

36:43.467 --> 36:47.767
Well, the gene defect
predisposes one towards
violent behavior.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.999
That wasn't the question,
I will rephrase it.

36:50.074 --> 36:53.840
If a man has a defect,
is he absolutely
going to be a rapist?

36:53.911 --> 36:55.845
No. Not absolutely.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.041
We know with
the cystic fibrosis gene

36:58.115 --> 37:00.208
if a child inherits the gene
from each of the parents,

37:00.284 --> 37:02.445
he or she will have
the disease.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.818
Is that the case with
the so-called "violent gene"?

37:04.889 --> 37:07.414
Well, a causative connection
has not yet been established.

37:07.491 --> 37:10.221
But aren't you asserting
your research predicts
violent behavior

37:10.294 --> 37:12.262
based on genetic makeup?

37:12.463 --> 37:16.058
No. There are other factors
such as upbringing.

37:16.133 --> 37:20.160
You never mentioned that
in your testimony. It sounded
to me as if you were saying

37:20.238 --> 37:23.002
genes are the only factor
in violent behavior.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.838
Well, I can't very well speak
to the influence
of environment.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.207
I am a geneticist.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.371
I see. So your testimony now

37:29.447 --> 37:32.416
is that violent behavior is,
in fact,
a combination of many factors,

37:32.483 --> 37:33.848
not just genetic.
Yes.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.386
So, in truth, you really can't
speak to the topic
at all, can you?

37:36.454 --> 37:37.512
Objection.
RIDENOUR: Counselor?

37:37.588 --> 37:39.818
Withdrawn. Nothing further.

37:43.628 --> 37:46.495
NELSON: Complex
scientific evidence aside,

37:46.564 --> 37:49.055
this case is about
the choices we make

37:49.600 --> 37:52.194
and the choices
that are made for us.

37:52.470 --> 37:56.099
Did Darrell Guan choose
for his father
to rape his mother,

37:56.374 --> 37:59.002
to be brought up
in a community, in a family,

37:59.076 --> 38:02.876
that every single day berated,
belittled and stigmatized him?

38:03.214 --> 38:05.910
Did he choose to have
a genetic defect?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.717
No.

38:09.620 --> 38:14.455
And now we're supposed to
tell him, "Well, too bad.
You should have known better."

38:15.092 --> 38:20.689
Darrell was born and Iived
in hell. His grandmother
called him the devil.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.756
Well, of course he was.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.324
He was engineered,
by nature and by nurture,

38:25.403 --> 38:28.099
to be exactly
what he turned out to be.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.098
And that is not his fault.

38:38.382 --> 38:41.317
Yes, Darrell Guan
had a difficult Iife.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.979
He was raised knowing
the only reason he exists

38:45.056 --> 38:47.684
is because his mother
was violently raped.

38:47.758 --> 38:51.717
One could understand why
he wouldn't grow up
to be a well-adjusted adult.

38:51.962 --> 38:54.487
But that's not an excuse
for murder.

38:55.766 --> 39:00.100
In a civilized society,
we have to take responsibility
for our actions.

39:00.705 --> 39:04.903
If we start to justify all
antisocial behavior under the
pretense it isn't our fault,

39:04.975 --> 39:08.206
then the entire structure
of the Iaw is meaningless.

39:08.446 --> 39:13.850
In the end, it comes down to
what it is to be
a human being.

39:14.985 --> 39:18.318
We're not just a product
of our genetic programming,

39:18.489 --> 39:22.892
nor are we solely molded
and motivated by
our childhood experiences.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.896
The defense would have you
believe Darrell Guan's Iife
was beyond his control.

39:26.964 --> 39:30.593
But the truth is, he was in
complete control at the time
he committed his crimes.

39:30.668 --> 39:33.102
He specifically
chose his victims,

39:33.170 --> 39:37.573
not because of some
biological imperative,
but because of opportunity.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.307
He knew what he was doing
was wrong,

39:40.378 --> 39:43.279
and he did everything
he could to get away with it.

39:45.182 --> 39:48.709
Darrell Guan chose
the course of his Iife.

39:51.055 --> 39:54.183
Make him take responsibility
for it.

40:07.872 --> 40:08.930
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

40:09.006 --> 40:10.132
Come in.

40:10.207 --> 40:11.606
BENSON: Hey.

40:12.076 --> 40:14.601
The verdict came in
on the Darrell Guan case.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.277
He's guilty on all charges.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.439
I heard.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.247
That was a tough case for me.

40:23.521 --> 40:26.615
Seems to have been
a tough case for you, as well.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.790
My mother was a rape victim.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.028
She got pregnant. She had me.

40:39.670 --> 40:42.764
So, yeah, it was personal.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.944
I think I'd be Iying
if I didn't admit that that's
probably the biggest reason

40:50.014 --> 40:53.677
that I decided to become
a cop. You know, to join SVU.

40:54.885 --> 40:58.753
I used to think that
it was because I wanted
to do something good,

40:58.823 --> 41:01.121
you know, make a difference.

41:02.726 --> 41:05.456
But you're questioning
those reasons now?

41:07.998 --> 41:10.364
I don't know. You know, I...

41:12.203 --> 41:14.000
I mean, Iook at my job. I'm...

41:15.473 --> 41:19.603
I have to be aggressive,
even violent.

41:21.612 --> 41:24.672
And you think that makes you
Iike Darrell Guan.

41:28.419 --> 41:31.582
Well, Iook at Darrell Guan.

41:33.991 --> 41:38.291
I keep trying to convince
myself that he had a choice.

41:38.963 --> 41:43.900
You know, be a rapist,
don't be a rapist. Be violent,
don't be violent. But...

41:46.437 --> 41:50.840
If he had this aggression
inside him,

41:50.908 --> 41:53.900
even violence, then,

41:56.380 --> 41:57.904
does he have a choice?

41:59.416 --> 42:00.849
Does anyone?

42:05.589 --> 42:07.819
You don't hurt people, OIivia.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.125
You protect them.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.892
You're proof that
we do have a choice.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.209
Or...

42:29.246 --> 42:31.544
Or maybe I'm just Iucky.
