        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i>

00:08.372 --> 00:10.672
Young man, a beer, please.

00:10.672 --> 00:14.271
        Hey... you're on
 Sunday morning TV, aren't you?

00:14.371 --> 00:15.371
            Indeed.

00:15.471 --> 00:17.571
                    Are you, uh,
                 David Brinkley?

00:17.670 --> 00:18.370
          No.

00:18.570 --> 00:19.870
                  Sam Donaldson?

00:19.870 --> 00:21.570
        Give me a break.

00:22.470 --> 00:24.269
                    Oh!

00:24.269 --> 00:27.169
              Aren't you the guy
          who keeps the Gorgeous
             Ladies of Wrestling

00:27.269 --> 00:29.968
            from tearing each
            other's hair out?

00:29.968 --> 00:31.168
You <i>could</i> say that.

00:31.268 --> 00:33.468
        Oh, man! Your money's
                no good here.

00:33.568 --> 00:34.968
Actually,

00:34.968 --> 00:37.267
I'm John McLaughlin--
I'm the moderator

00:37.367 --> 00:40.467
of a political roundtable
called <i>The McLaughlin Group.</i>

00:40.667 --> 00:42.966
     Oh. Well, that'll be $2.50.

00:42.966 --> 00:45.266
      (theme song begins)

00:49.465 --> 00:51.665
    ¶ Making your way
      in the world today ¶

00:51.765 --> 00:54.964
¶ Takes everything you've got ¶

00:54.964 --> 00:57.564
        ¶ Taking a break
    from all your worries ¶

00:57.664 --> 01:01.063
¶ Sure would help a lot

01:01.163 --> 01:04.962
      ¶ Wouldn't you like
         to get away? ¶

01:06.163 --> 01:08.562
  ¶ Sometimes you want to go

01:08.662 --> 01:13.062
    ¶ Where everybody
    knows your name ¶

01:14.361 --> 01:18.961
      ¶ And they're always
        glad you came ¶

01:18.961 --> 01:21.160
         ¶ You wanna be
      where you can see ¶

01:21.260 --> 01:23.760
         ¶ Our troubles
    are all the same ¶

01:23.860 --> 01:28.059
      ¶ You wanna be where
  everybody knows your name ¶

01:29.259 --> 01:31.259
         ¶ You wanna go
      where people know ¶

01:31.259 --> 01:34.458
  ¶ People are all the same

02:00.854 --> 02:02.454
        (cheering)

02:05.353 --> 02:06.853
         Good evening.

02:06.953 --> 02:08.553
     Welcome to <i>Cheers 200.</i>

02:08.652 --> 02:10.151
      I'm John McLaughlin.

02:10.252 --> 02:12.652
         A little more
     than eight years ago,

02:12.752 --> 02:15.251
        (phone ringing)
      <i>a pseudo-intellectual</i>
         <i>college student</i>

02:15.351 --> 02:19.051
     <i>walked into a bar</i>
 <i>and met a recovering alcoholic</i>

02:19.151 --> 02:22.250
     <i>ex-relief pitcher</i>
     <i>for the Boston Red Sox.</i>

02:22.350 --> 02:23.550
             Hello?

02:23.650 --> 02:25.050
              Sam?

02:26.950 --> 02:29.049
          Are you Sam?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.249
         (mouth full):
              Yes.
Yes, he's here.

02:31.349 --> 02:32.549
      Someone named Vicky.

02:32.549 --> 02:34.348
             No, no, no, no, no.

02:35.348 --> 02:36.948
No. She knows you're here.

02:37.048 --> 02:38.548
    I told her you're here.

02:38.648 --> 02:40.747
            Well...

02:40.847 --> 02:42.047
          Now, look...

02:42.047 --> 02:43.147
        (mumbling)

02:43.347 --> 02:45.247
    I'm sorry. I was wrong.

02:45.247 --> 02:47.246
      He had to step out.

02:47.246 --> 02:48.846
             Where?

02:50.146 --> 02:51.746
Well, um...

02:51.746 --> 02:53.945
I think what happened is,
        he, uh....

02:54.945 --> 02:55.045
He had t...

02:56.245 --> 02:58.344
  he had to go to mime class.

03:01.244 --> 03:05.143
     That week, America was
    supremely uninterested.

03:05.243 --> 03:08.043
     <i>Cheers</i> ranked #77

03:08.143 --> 03:11.742
    out of a possible
      77 television shows.

03:11.742 --> 03:13.442
        (laughter)
          Last season,

03:13.542 --> 03:16.941
 it was the #1 television show
          in America.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.341
     On this, the occasion

03:19.441 --> 03:22.041
of the 200th episode of <i>Cheers,</i>

03:22.141 --> 03:25.040
    we will be showing
  some of the many highlights,

03:25.140 --> 03:29.139
         and lowlights,
of the first 199 episodes,

03:29.239 --> 03:31.239
    as well as talking

03:31.339 --> 03:33.339
 to the originators, the cast,

03:33.439 --> 03:35.438
and the current caretakers

03:35.538 --> 03:39.838
  of the little bar in Boston
where everybody knows your name.

03:39.938 --> 03:41.937
      We'll be right back.

03:42.137 --> 03:45.237
It's like I'm
in complete control
of people's destinies.

03:45.337 --> 03:48.036
                    Oh, yeah?
     Yeah, like, I can make
    their drinks too strong

03:48.036 --> 03:49.636
    so they get sick.
                         Uh-huh.

03:49.636 --> 03:53.036
 Or, uh, I can water 'em down,
 so they're paying for nothing.

03:53.036 --> 03:54.635
                      Yeah.
Or if I don't like

03:54.635 --> 03:57.335
        their attitudes,
    I can spit in it.

03:57.435 --> 03:58.735
            (laughs)

04:06.133 --> 04:07.633
 Carla, you're not still upset

04:07.733 --> 04:10.533
about that little argument
     we had the other day?

04:10.533 --> 04:12.432
          You tell me.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.730
  Oh, uh, hey, Carla, listen,
  I'm sorry about this morning

04:27.730 --> 04:31.529
    when I called you
      a "sawed-off witch."

04:36.728 --> 04:39.728
            PEOPLE:
              <i>Norm!</i>

04:39.728 --> 04:42.328
George, you want to tell us
about Norm Peterson?

04:42.328 --> 04:44.727
Well, uh, he hangs out in a bar.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.827
        (laughter)
        He, uh...

04:46.927 --> 04:50.426
 he's got darned good writers.

04:50.526 --> 04:51.626
     Afternoon, everybody.

04:51.626 --> 04:53.626
                            ALL:
                        Norm!

04:53.626 --> 04:56.025
                What's up, Norm?
          My nipples--
    it's freezing out there.

04:57.925 --> 04:59.125
What are you up to, Norm?

04:59.225 --> 05:02.324
        My ideal weight,
    if I were 11 feet tall.

05:04.924 --> 05:07.723
Hey, Mr. Peterson, Jack Frost
          nippin' at  your nose?

05:07.723 --> 05:11.923
  Yeah. Now let's get Joe Beer
nippin' at my liver, huh?

05:13.723 --> 05:15.022
 What's going on, Mr. Peterson?

05:15.022 --> 05:18.222
    Let's talk about what's
     going <i>in</i> Mr. Peterson.

05:18.322 --> 05:19.722
  Hey, what's happening, Norm?

05:19.822 --> 05:21.821
        Well, it's
  a dog-eat-dog world, Sammy,

05:21.921 --> 05:24.121
                 and I'm wearing
            Milk Bone underwear.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.120
    Norm's a very loyal guy.

05:30.220 --> 05:34.019
 Unfortunately, his priorities
 are a little bit out of whack.

05:34.019 --> 05:36.919
        (clears throat):
  He's loyal to the bar first,

05:37.019 --> 05:39.618
    and, uh, you know,
    to his marriage...

05:39.718 --> 05:43.018
    somewhere down the line,
        but he is loyal.

05:43.118 --> 05:45.317
You can't go sneaking out nights
     on somebody you love.

05:45.417 --> 05:48.217
        Woody, you have
  to believe that truth and...
Norm, it's Vera.

05:48.317 --> 05:53.116
I'm not here-- honesty are
the cornerstones of a marriage.

05:53.216 --> 05:55.516
        I promised Vera
 I'd pick up some Chinese food.

05:55.516 --> 05:56.816
    Oh, that's nice
     of you, Norm.

05:56.916 --> 06:01.015
    Well, I spilled it
on the floor this morning.

06:02.415 --> 06:04.414
                  Sheesh! Women.

06:04.414 --> 06:07.714
        You can't live with 'em.
             Pass the beer nuts.

06:10.813 --> 06:13.113
Hey, Norm, how come you and Vera
      never had any kids?

06:13.113 --> 06:14.913
        I can't, Coach.

06:15.013 --> 06:16.412
     Gee, I'm sorry, Norm.

06:16.412 --> 06:19.612
 I look at Vera, I just can't.

06:22.411 --> 06:23.911
    See you in the morning,
         I guess, huh?

06:24.111 --> 06:25.311
 Yeah, I may be a little late.

06:25.411 --> 06:28.010
        Oh, that's okay.
    I had a key made.

06:29.810 --> 06:32.410
    I came, I drank...

06:32.510 --> 06:34.209
        I stayed.

06:34.309 --> 06:36.909
        (laughter)

06:36.909 --> 06:38.409
                    (deep groan)

06:38.409 --> 06:40.009
What's the matter, Norm?

06:40.108 --> 06:43.708
                    Aw, nothing.
              Just my shorts are
            binding up on me.

06:50.007 --> 06:53.606
    Just, uh, you know, stand up
and straighten 'em out a little.

06:53.606 --> 06:57.106
Nah. I'll give 'em five minutes.
    Sometimes they self-correct.

07:00.805 --> 07:04.005
             CARLA:
 <i>I've been down this road</i>
       <i>a few times myself,</i>

07:04.105 --> 07:05.804
     <i>and take it from a pro:</i>

07:05.904 --> 07:07.504
              there is one thing
        you always have to do

07:07.504 --> 07:09.104
        before you tell a guy
                you love him.

07:09.104 --> 07:11.903
What's that?
              Lose the mustache.

07:17.802 --> 07:19.602
Rhea, tell us about Carla.

07:19.602 --> 07:21.802
  Well, she's, um, a survivor.

07:21.902 --> 07:23.901
        She's a realist.

07:24.001 --> 07:25.901
She's very fertile.

07:25.901 --> 07:28.201
        (laughter)

07:30.400 --> 07:34.600
      I cannot let any man
touch me, talk to me or see me,

07:34.700 --> 07:37.599
  or I'll be shooting out kids
     like a Pez dispenser.

07:40.399 --> 07:42.198
 Do you think that she's mean?

07:42.198 --> 07:43.898
 No. I don't think she's mean.

07:43.998 --> 07:45.498
I think that she's honest.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.298
Frasier, you're brilliant!

07:47.398 --> 07:49.497
That is one of
the most brilliant ideas

07:49.497 --> 07:51.797
you've ever had, and you've had
a lot of brilliant ideas.

07:51.797 --> 07:53.097
    Thank you, Carla.

07:53.197 --> 07:54.097
     See, Woody? It works.

07:54.196 --> 07:55.296
      Bonehead bought it.

07:58.296 --> 07:59.596
                Nothing wrong
                  with sweating.

07:59.696 --> 08:02.195
         I myself have perspired
                  once or twice.

08:02.195 --> 08:03.995
    We could grow rice.

08:05.995 --> 08:08.194
Give me a little something
with hair on it.

08:08.294 --> 08:10.194
Here I am.

08:12.494 --> 08:14.693
So, uh,

08:14.793 --> 08:15.593
you married?

08:15.693 --> 08:16.993
             Yes, quite happily.

08:16.993 --> 08:19.692
Too bad. Could've been
my first Englishman.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.192
Oh, no, no, no, wait.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.092
There was that one other guy,
but he was so white,

08:24.192 --> 08:25.991
I kept losing him
in the sheets.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.991
Does everybody
like Carla?

08:30.091 --> 08:31.290
                    Oh, yeah.
        Oh, yeah.

08:31.390 --> 08:32.789
                    You have to.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.990
        (laughter)

08:35.090 --> 08:37.789
 Did Carla like Diane Chambers?

08:37.889 --> 08:39.489
        (laughs):
              No.
No?

08:39.589 --> 08:40.589
    Suffice it to say,

08:40.688 --> 08:44.188
 he insists on making mountains
    out of molehills.

08:44.188 --> 08:46.388
      He wants you to wear
         a padded bra?

08:50.187 --> 08:52.187
        I can no longer
        hold my tongue.

08:52.287 --> 08:54.487
            Want me to do it?

08:57.586 --> 09:00.186
     He has saved hundreds,
         nay, thousands

09:00.186 --> 09:01.586
of troubled marriages.

09:01.586 --> 09:05.385
 It's even rumored that he had
a hand in helping Chuck and Di.

09:05.585 --> 09:08.284
    Speaking of that,
 why don't <i>you</i> upchuck and die?

09:11.184 --> 09:12.384
    Do you like Cliff?

09:12.484 --> 09:13.784
              No.

09:13.884 --> 09:15.283
McLAUGHLIN:
You don't like Cliff?
No.

09:15.383 --> 09:18.283
It's a little known fact that
42% of all deaths in America

09:18.383 --> 09:20.582
are caused by accidents
in the home.

09:20.582 --> 09:22.082
                    So were you.

09:24.682 --> 09:26.382
         Yeah, you'd never catch
                 a woman of mine

09:26.482 --> 09:27.881
            leading me around
                    by the nose.

09:27.981 --> 09:30.881
No, but you might catch her
sunning herself on a rock.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.480
What a pathetic display.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.080
I'm ashamed God
made me a man.

09:38.180 --> 09:41.779
I don't think God's doing a lot
 of bragging about it, either.

09:42.979 --> 09:45.079
             CLIFF:
 <i>If you go back in history</i>

09:45.178 --> 09:46.978
 <i>and, uh, take every president,</i>

09:47.078 --> 09:48.878
        you'll find that
      the numerical value

09:48.978 --> 09:51.078
         of each letter
    in their last name

09:51.078 --> 09:52.877
     was equally divisible
         into the, uh,

09:52.977 --> 09:54.677
year in which they were elected.

09:54.777 --> 09:56.277
        All right.

09:56.377 --> 09:57.477
CLIFF:
See,

09:57.477 --> 09:59.476
I figured it out,
and by my calculations,

09:59.476 --> 10:02.776
uh, our next president
has to be named...

10:02.776 --> 10:04.975
Yelnick McWaWa.

10:06.775 --> 10:08.675
      Who is Cliff Clavin?

10:08.675 --> 10:11.074
          Well, Cliff,
  according to Cliff, would...

10:11.174 --> 10:15.274
he'd be the wing nut that holds
 Western civilization together.

10:15.374 --> 10:17.473
        (laughter)
        He, uh...

10:17.473 --> 10:22.173
        according to me,
he'd just be a winged nut.

10:22.272 --> 10:25.072
      You know, you've got
      a big mouth, Clavin.

10:25.172 --> 10:28.371
Hey, he happens to be
right, you know.

10:28.571 --> 10:30.871
Yeah, it's a genetic quirk
in the, uh, Clavin family

10:30.871 --> 10:32.871
that we all have
two extra teeth.

10:32.871 --> 10:35.470
Uh, you see, that's the
only way that we can prove

10:35.570 --> 10:38.370
that we are the rightful heirs
to the Russian throne.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.869
          Hello in there, Cliff.

10:43.769 --> 10:48.268
          Tell me, what color is
          the sky in your world?

10:49.168 --> 10:50.368
    You know, I, uh...

10:50.368 --> 10:54.067
      I happen to be a bit
of an expert on tapeworms.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.167
        It all goes, uh,
        it all goes back

10:56.267 --> 10:57.467
to my eighth-grade science fair.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.866
  You know, everybody else had
    rabbits and guinea pigs.

10:59.966 --> 11:02.366
    I, uh, had a tapeworm.

11:02.466 --> 11:03.266
            Really?

11:03.266 --> 11:04.866
         Yeah, so I couldn't go.

11:07.665 --> 11:10.965
          Or was that, uh,
        was that a ringworm?

11:10.965 --> 11:12.564
         Check, please.

11:12.664 --> 11:15.264
Yeah, boy, boy, boy...

11:15.364 --> 11:18.863
Me and parasites--
don't get me started.

11:18.963 --> 11:21.263
John, is there, is there
a part of you in Cliff?

11:21.363 --> 11:25.162
Oh, yeah, I, I, I am fascinated
  by fascinating facts, yeah.

11:25.262 --> 11:26.862
Is there a part
of Cliff in you?

11:26.962 --> 11:28.262
    Uh, I wear white socks.

11:28.262 --> 11:30.061
        (laughter)

11:31.761 --> 11:33.761
                        NORM:
                         Well...

11:33.861 --> 11:35.361
CLIFF:
Yeah...
          I tell ya...

11:35.461 --> 11:37.060
                    Is that, uh,

11:37.160 --> 11:39.460
    Cliff Clavin or is
    that Don Ho, huh?

11:39.560 --> 11:40.760
        Ah...

11:40.860 --> 11:41.960
        Where ya been, buddy?

11:42.060 --> 11:43.959
            Some, uh, faraway
                  island resort?

11:43.959 --> 11:45.559
Oh, easy mistake,
Norm, but, no,

11:45.659 --> 11:48.259
I got this tan right
here in Beantown.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.558
    Is that at the new, uh,

11:49.658 --> 11:51.558
 Tan and Wash I've been hearing
      so dang much about?

11:51.558 --> 11:52.758
     That's right, Normie.

11:52.858 --> 11:54.258
And by the way, did you realize

11:54.258 --> 11:55.657
that the tan first gained
        popularity

11:55.757 --> 11:57.857
      in what is now known
    as the Bronze Age?

11:57.857 --> 11:59.557
                Great, great,
                 well, I'm sold.

11:59.657 --> 12:02.456
Oh, and, by the way, uh,
look how white I used to be.

12:06.256 --> 12:09.555
          McLAUGHLIN:
      <i>During the course of</i>
     <i>the history of</i> Cheers,

12:09.555 --> 12:11.455
you lost a character.

12:11.455 --> 12:13.155
You lost a man.
        Right.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.954
Nick Colasanto,
who played the part

12:16.054 --> 12:19.254
of Ernie Pantuso,
the Coach.

12:19.354 --> 12:21.053
 Uh, Nickie was like a father.
    I mean, he came...

12:21.153 --> 12:22.753
    He was the father
      and Woody's the kid.

12:22.753 --> 12:25.952
    I mean, that was, uh...
Nicky was the... the sage.

12:26.052 --> 12:28.452
         He used to say
 he used to play the character

12:28.452 --> 12:29.652
      like a 12-year-old.

12:29.752 --> 12:31.352
    He would sit and listen

12:31.452 --> 12:33.851
  to everybody like they made
        complete sense.

12:33.851 --> 12:35.451
        I, I don't know
      if you know the set,

12:35.551 --> 12:36.951
        but he's still,
      he's still present.

12:36.951 --> 12:38.150
  We put a picture of Geronimo

12:38.250 --> 12:39.650
         that Nicky had
     in his dressing room,

12:39.650 --> 12:42.050
we put that on the upstage wall
        of <i>Cheers</i>

12:42.150 --> 12:44.549
so he's, uh, he's still present
        and, uh...

12:44.549 --> 12:47.349
He was a former coach
in professional baseball?

12:47.449 --> 12:49.249
He was Sam's coach, yeah.

12:49.449 --> 12:51.548
  He had a record in the minor
  league being hit by a pitch

12:51.548 --> 12:53.348
         more than any
        other person...
(laughs)

12:53.348 --> 12:55.148
    I mean, what I'd do was,

12:55.148 --> 12:56.947
                I'd get up there
                and lean my body

12:57.047 --> 12:58.347
     into the pitch, right?

12:58.447 --> 13:01.747
And, well, sometimes I took one
 right in the old melon, but...

13:01.847 --> 13:03.546
             I mean, I really...

13:03.646 --> 13:05.346
    I really made a science
        out of it.

13:05.346 --> 13:07.146
              I became a master.

13:07.246 --> 13:09.445
                 Well, here, try
                     to miss me.
              Oh.

13:11.745 --> 13:12.445
                      You ready?

13:12.545 --> 13:14.145
            Okay, here we go.

13:15.844 --> 13:18.144
I'm not gonna get it
anywhere near him.

13:18.144 --> 13:19.944
    That's the whole point.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.643
                     (soft thud)

13:23.643 --> 13:25.243
(gasps)

13:26.443 --> 13:27.442
              Oh!

13:27.542 --> 13:28.742
                          COACH:
                I'm on my way
                    to first!

13:28.742 --> 13:30.142
     Whoo!

13:30.342 --> 13:33.142
    Nicky was amazing.
      He was a director...

13:33.242 --> 13:34.841
          Accomplished director,
                      teacher...

13:34.841 --> 13:36.041
    A very, very bright man,

13:36.141 --> 13:38.441
      and he would, like,
he would drive on the lot,

13:38.441 --> 13:40.740
        and he, he'd say
  that he'd get out of his car

13:40.840 --> 13:42.440
 and he'd, psst, turn that off.

13:42.540 --> 13:45.040
And then, pshew, he was...
he was Coach from then on.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.639
            Cheers.

13:46.739 --> 13:47.639
    Yeah, just a sec.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.639
Is there an Ernie Pantuso here?

13:49.739 --> 13:50.739
SAM:
That's you, Coach.

13:50.739 --> 13:52.238
        Speaking.

13:53.938 --> 13:55.638
        Boy, oh, boy...

13:55.738 --> 13:58.038
      The damnedest thing.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.537
I've been shivering all the way
        over here.

14:00.537 --> 14:01.937
          Well, Coach,
you don't have a coat on.

14:01.937 --> 14:03.737
        It's 30 degrees outside.

14:03.837 --> 14:07.236
         Oh, thank God!
    I thought I had malaria.

14:07.336 --> 14:08.936
             Whew!

14:09.036 --> 14:10.735
Uh, Coach, I'm
having blackouts.

14:10.835 --> 14:14.335
Kind of a nice break in the day,
        isn't it, Sammy?

14:14.435 --> 14:15.435
Do you remember
Nick, Shelley?

14:15.535 --> 14:16.734
            Dearly.

14:16.834 --> 14:20.534
He was really Diane's only
      friend, real friend.

14:20.534 --> 14:24.933
He would listen to Diane,
    and he would counsel her

14:25.033 --> 14:28.133
    and-and offer her a kind
of support and friendship

14:28.233 --> 14:30.432
    that didn't really
        come out clearly

14:30.532 --> 14:33.532
 from many of the other members
          in the bar.

14:33.632 --> 14:34.732
DIANE:
Coach?

14:34.832 --> 14:36.331
         What do you do
    when you are so furious

14:36.431 --> 14:38.631
 that you have to do something?

14:38.731 --> 14:41.031
Well, I know you'll think
      it's kind of crazy,

14:41.131 --> 14:44.230
    but, uh, I bang my head
          on the bar.

14:46.530 --> 14:47.629
Doesn't sound crazy to me.

14:47.729 --> 14:50.129
         It might do me
    a lot of good right now.

14:50.229 --> 14:51.429
          Well, okay.

14:53.129 --> 14:55.528
    No! No, oh, don't!

14:55.628 --> 14:58.428
    But, uh, uh, you're so,
you're so beautiful, so...

14:58.528 --> 15:00.127
    Beautiful?

15:00.127 --> 15:02.527
Daddy, you have been saying
that I'm beautiful

15:02.627 --> 15:04.727
ever since I was
a very little girl.

15:04.827 --> 15:06.326
But look at me!

15:06.426 --> 15:07.926
Not as my father,

15:08.026 --> 15:10.126
  but like you're lookin' at me
      for the first time,

15:10.226 --> 15:14.025
and please, try to see me
        as I really am.

15:20.024 --> 15:21.524
                Oh, my God! I...

15:21.524 --> 15:24.523
    I didn't realize how much
    you looked like your mother.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.623
        I know.

15:26.723 --> 15:28.523
I look exactly like her.

15:28.523 --> 15:30.822
    And Mom was not...

15:36.222 --> 15:38.921
    ...comfortable
    about her beauty.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.821
            But that's what made
             her more beautiful.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.620
                Your mother grew
                  more beautiful

15:46.720 --> 15:49.020
          every day of her life.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.518
She was really beautiful.

15:55.618 --> 15:57.718
            Yes! And so are you.

15:57.718 --> 16:01.018
    You're the most beautiful
         kid in the whole world.

16:03.317 --> 16:04.717
Thanks, Daddy.

16:15.515 --> 16:17.815
          LES CHARLES:
      <i>We wanted to create,</i>
       <i>uh... there are...</i>

16:17.915 --> 16:19.615
      there are in America
    great neighborhood bars.

16:19.615 --> 16:21.714
But not everybody has one,
 and so we thought we'd give--

16:21.714 --> 16:24.614
uh, for all those poor, deprived
  people-- we'd give them one.

16:24.714 --> 16:26.413
  And that included ourselves.
      We didn't have one.

16:26.413 --> 16:29.713
      So we created one--
a place that we would like to go

16:29.813 --> 16:32.612
    and spend time and, uh,
    where everybody could go

16:32.712 --> 16:35.712
     one night a week and,
      and be with friends.

16:35.712 --> 16:38.911
(shrieking)

16:38.911 --> 16:42.011
                      (shouting)

16:42.211 --> 16:44.011
        (all clamoring)

16:44.111 --> 16:46.210
Come on! Carla!

16:46.310 --> 16:47.410
Easy!
                Yeah, I got her!

16:50.210 --> 16:52.109
          Let go! Oh!

16:52.109 --> 16:53.409
         Let go of me!

16:53.409 --> 16:54.909
You get your hand out!
Just stop it!

16:54.909 --> 16:56.609
     You had the gall! Oh!
Just get...!

16:59.908 --> 17:01.608
             Whoa!

17:01.608 --> 17:03.507
              SAM:
        Stop that!
    Come on, you guys.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.607
        (shouting)

17:04.707 --> 17:07.507
         Whoa, whoa...
Oh, no! No!

17:07.507 --> 17:09.506
CARLA:
Whoops!

17:09.606 --> 17:13.705
          (screaming):
              No!

17:13.705 --> 17:15.605
        (groaning)

17:16.605 --> 17:17.704
            Oh, no!

17:20.305 --> 17:21.405
    (Diane shrieking)

17:21.505 --> 17:24.104
     Stop this immediately!

17:29.503 --> 17:31.203
I have never been witness

17:31.203 --> 17:34.702

17:43.501 --> 17:45.701
         Sam Malone...

17:45.701 --> 17:48.200
    kiss your butt good-bye!

17:48.300 --> 17:51.600

          what was it?

18:07.997 --> 18:09.197
         I think that there
          was an intensity

18:09.297 --> 18:12.596
      with the Sam and Diane,
     uh, affair that was, uh...

18:12.696 --> 18:13.796
                     McLAUGHLIN:
                     Dominating?

18:13.796 --> 18:15.196
          Yeah, very much so.

18:15.196 --> 18:16.596
A really intelligent woman
        would see

18:16.696 --> 18:19.795
  your line of BS a mile away.

18:19.795 --> 18:20.395
              You think so? Huh?

18:20.595 --> 18:21.995
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

18:21.995 --> 18:24.194
                 Yeah, well, uh,
                    you know,

18:24.294 --> 18:27.494
            I've never met an
            intelligent woman
          that I'd want to date.

18:27.594 --> 18:31.593
  On behalf of the intelligent
    women around the world,

18:31.693 --> 18:34.493
    may I just say... whew!

18:38.192 --> 18:40.092
Well, I'll be darned.

18:40.192 --> 18:42.091
                     What?

18:42.191 --> 18:45.091
Nothing. I just, uh,
noticed something.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.891
                     What?

18:46.891 --> 18:51.090
  Well, I guess I've, uh, I've
  never looked into your eyes.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.390
Something wrong with them?

18:53.390 --> 18:56.889
 No, I, uh... just don't think

18:56.989 --> 18:59.289
      I've ever seen eyes
    that color before.

18:59.289 --> 19:01.288
As a matter of fact,
I don't think

19:01.388 --> 19:03.988
I've ever seen
that <i>color</i> before.

19:04.088 --> 19:06.887
          Yes, I have.
          Yes, I have.

19:09.387 --> 19:11.587
                     Where?

19:11.687 --> 19:16.786
I was, uh, I was on a ski
weekend up at Stowe. I...

19:16.886 --> 19:21.385
 I was comin' in late one day,
 uh, last person off the slope.

19:21.485 --> 19:24.485
The, the sun had just gone down.

19:24.585 --> 19:27.984
    And the sky became
     this incredible color.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.884
I, I usually don't, uh,
notice things like that,

19:30.984 --> 19:34.383
and I found myself kind of
walking around in the cold,

19:34.483 --> 19:37.383
hoping that it wouldn't change,

19:37.383 --> 19:40.982
 wishing that I, I had somebody
there to share it with me.

19:41.082 --> 19:43.182
    Then afterwards I tried
    to convince myself

19:43.182 --> 19:45.881
 that I'd imagined that color,
            that...

19:45.981 --> 19:47.881
 that I hadn't really seen it.

19:47.881 --> 19:51.680
That nothing on this earth
could be that beautiful.

19:51.780 --> 19:54.580
     Now I see I was wrong.

20:00.379 --> 20:02.278
Wouldn't work, huh?

20:04.778 --> 20:06.178
                     What?

20:06.278 --> 20:09.977
      An intelligent woman
 would see right through that?

20:11.177 --> 20:13.377
            Oh? Oh!

20:15.776 --> 20:17.776
                In a minute.

20:17.776 --> 20:19.176
    Damn.

20:23.875 --> 20:26.075
              SAM
      <i>You are the nuttiest,</i>

20:26.075 --> 20:29.674
  the stupidest, the phoniest
     fruitcake I ever met!

20:29.774 --> 20:31.974
You, Sam Malone, are the most
arrogant, self-centered son...

20:32.074 --> 20:33.073
                        Shut up!

20:33.073 --> 20:34.773
      Shut your fat mouth!

20:34.873 --> 20:36.473
        Make me.
                 Make you?

20:36.573 --> 20:38.273
My God, I'm, I'm gonna...

20:38.373 --> 20:40.772
    I'm gonna bounce you off
every wall in this office!

20:40.872 --> 20:43.972
      Try it and you'll be
    walking funny tomorrow.

20:46.271 --> 20:47.871
Or should I say funnier?

20:47.871 --> 20:51.870
  You know... you know, I always
          wanted to pop you one.

20:51.870 --> 20:54.070
                Maybe this is
              my lucky day, huh?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.670
You disgust me!

20:55.670 --> 20:56.970
    I hate you!

20:57.070 --> 20:58.269
            Are you as turned on
                  as I am?

20:58.269 --> 21:00.169
        More!
                    Bet me.

21:02.069 --> 21:03.569
Wh-Whenever you think
too much about something,

21:03.669 --> 21:04.768
it loses all its sense.

21:04.868 --> 21:06.668
I mean, obviously the only
reason why I'm with you

21:06.768 --> 21:08.168
is because I lo...

21:10.767 --> 21:12.567
        What, Sam?

21:12.567 --> 21:18.466
I said the reason why I'm
with you is 'cause I lo...

21:18.566 --> 21:20.266
        You lo...?

21:20.266 --> 21:23.365
        Well, you know,
     you know what I mean.

21:23.465 --> 21:25.265
    Well, what's the matter?
    Can't you say it?

21:25.265 --> 21:26.265
      Oh, of course I can.

21:26.365 --> 21:28.065
I lo... I lo... I lo... I lo...

21:28.165 --> 21:30.964
            DIANE:
 <i>Do you know what the difference</i>

21:31.064 --> 21:33.264
         is between you
    and a fat, braying ass?

21:33.264 --> 21:34.663
             Nope.

21:34.663 --> 21:37.863
The fat braying ass would.

21:40.862 --> 21:42.762
                Speaking of fat,
                  braying asses,

21:42.862 --> 21:44.762
             you're about to get
                dumped on yours.

21:46.162 --> 21:49.061
How dare you slap me!

21:52.561 --> 21:54.460
Don't you ever hit me again!

21:54.560 --> 21:55.760
                      Like hell.

22:01.459 --> 22:03.359
            You always think you
      gotta get the last one in.

22:03.459 --> 22:05.259
                    Oh, come on.
     All right, all right, fine!

22:05.359 --> 22:08.658
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
             All right, come on.

22:08.758 --> 22:10.258
              SAM:
   <i>All right, please, come on.</i>
             <i>Let go.</i>

22:10.358 --> 22:11.757
       <i>Oh, what the hell?</i>

22:11.857 --> 22:13.457
    Will you marry me?

22:17.757 --> 22:19.356
              Will you marry me?

22:19.356 --> 22:21.056
            No.

22:22.956 --> 22:26.655
Oh, Diane, will you marry me?

22:26.655 --> 22:30.354
                     (sobbing):
                      No, Sam.

22:30.454 --> 22:33.554
Diane, will you marry me?

22:33.654 --> 22:37.353
That didn't sound very sincere.

22:43.052 --> 22:45.452
I'll be back here.

22:45.552 --> 22:47.352
        I will.

22:47.452 --> 22:50.051
I'll see you in six months.

22:50.151 --> 22:51.751
    Okay?

22:51.751 --> 22:53.251
                     Okay.

22:53.251 --> 22:54.251
        Okay.

22:54.251 --> 22:55.850
    That's better.

23:04.249 --> 23:06.249
         (door closes)

23:10.248 --> 23:12.548
    Have a good life.

23:12.548 --> 23:16.547
(piano playing "What'll I Do?")

23:27.645 --> 23:29.645
              ¶

23:45.142 --> 23:48.042
              ¶

24:06.139 --> 24:08.639
             JOHN:
         <i>Frasier Crane--</i>
  <i>what does he do for a living?</i>

24:08.739 --> 24:11.838
      He's a psychiatrist.

24:11.938 --> 24:14.938
    What is Frasier's
      philosophy of life?

24:15.037 --> 24:17.637
      He hopes he can heal
      the human condition.

24:17.737 --> 24:19.137
         Come on, man!

24:19.237 --> 24:20.837
    Tell Diane you love her.

24:20.837 --> 24:23.136
Let some fresh air and sunlight
        in there!

24:23.136 --> 24:25.336
                Frasier?

24:25.336 --> 24:26.436
    What, Sam?

24:26.536 --> 24:28.935
            I don't like guys
            touching my head.

24:28.935 --> 24:32.135
Well, there's our next session.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.334
Is there, uh,
some of you in him?

24:37.434 --> 24:38.934
                Sure.

24:38.934 --> 24:42.033
            I would like to heal
              the world, yeah.

24:42.133 --> 24:43.433
Have you notified
the world?

24:43.433 --> 24:45.333
            Uh, in my small way,
                yeah.

24:45.433 --> 24:46.332
(chuckles)

24:46.432 --> 24:48.832
Is there some
of him in you?

24:48.932 --> 24:55.131
        Uh, well, we do walk the
      same streets together now.

24:57.031 --> 24:59.430
  I am running with scissors!

25:04.429 --> 25:06.329
         You see, it's been
     psychologically documented

25:06.329 --> 25:11.128
that all human animals have a
  neurotic hair-trigger response

25:11.228 --> 25:14.228
         to, uh, at least one of
    the five sensory stimuli.

25:14.328 --> 25:16.528
             Well, it could be
            anything, actually.

25:16.528 --> 25:20.127
 Well, let's see, sound of the
surf pounding against the shore.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.827
        The smell of honeysuckle
         on a warm summer night.

25:22.827 --> 25:26.426
          The taste of a vintage
             Chateau Neu d'pais.

25:26.526 --> 25:31.725
    Fire-red fingernails dancing
        through your chest hair.

25:33.225 --> 25:37.024
        A black-lace teddy...

25:37.124 --> 25:40.524
            straining against
            its fleshy cargo.

25:40.624 --> 25:43.223
Frasier, man,
snap out of it.

25:43.223 --> 25:45.723
            In a minute, Sam.

25:48.022 --> 25:50.922
Did psychiatrist
Frasier Crane

25:50.922 --> 25:55.221
provide services
for Diane Chambers?

25:55.221 --> 25:58.221
                      No.
        No, that was,
          that was my job.

26:04.420 --> 26:07.119
      When Diane left Sam,
 and he started drinking again,

26:07.219 --> 26:09.819
    he was filling the void
        that Diane left.

26:09.919 --> 26:14.518
 And Diane filled her emptiness
         by toying with

26:14.618 --> 26:18.817
      and... destroying...
    a man who's her cultural

26:18.817 --> 26:21.217
and intellectual superior
         in every way!

26:24.117 --> 26:26.216
                REBECCA:
         Okay, kids, you say hi
            to Binky!

26:26.316 --> 26:29.216
KIDS:
Hi, Binky!

26:33.615 --> 26:35.015
      Binky, do your act.

26:35.015 --> 26:38.914
      I don't have an act.
      I'm a psychiatrist.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.114
             NORM:
      <i>Uh-oh, frost warning.</i>

26:45.513 --> 26:47.613
    Good afternoon,
    Dr. Crane.

26:50.812 --> 26:53.012
                Dr. Sternin.
              (clears throat)

26:53.012 --> 26:54.612
         What a lovely surprise.

26:54.612 --> 26:57.111
    I hope I can regard that
          as civility

26:57.111 --> 26:58.611
 in light of today's situation,

26:58.711 --> 27:01.011
      rather than sarcasm
         at my expense.

27:01.111 --> 27:04.310
    No, that was completely
        at your expense.

27:06.110 --> 27:09.309
 What these two people, who are
such geniuses at romance,

27:09.409 --> 27:13.709
  are trying to do is to get you
         to take your hair down,

27:13.709 --> 27:15.308
                thinking that it
            will stimulate me

27:15.408 --> 27:17.708
            like some sort of
                  Pavlovian dog.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.507
                So why don't you
            just oblige them,

27:22.607 --> 27:24.307
             get this silliness
                 over with

27:24.307 --> 27:25.607
                so we can get on
                 with our lives?

27:25.707 --> 27:27.506
        (sighs)

27:31.406 --> 27:33.105
You mean like this?

27:33.105 --> 27:35.005
                    Precisely.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.305
                  You know what?

27:38.405 --> 27:39.704
            What?

27:39.804 --> 27:41.504
          I'm going to kiss you.

27:42.804 --> 27:43.604
         I'm gonna kiss you hard

27:43.704 --> 27:45.403
                and I'm going
            to kiss you long.

27:47.803 --> 27:49.203
             But make no mistake
                    about it,

27:49.303 --> 27:50.503
         I am going to kiss you.

27:50.603 --> 27:52.002
             In fact, I'm going
                to kiss you

27:52.102 --> 27:53.702
            like you've never...

27:56.702 --> 28:01.001
            WOODY:
     <i>Oh, boy, my Aunt Edna's</i>
     <i>killer fudge brownies.</i>

28:01.001 --> 28:02.701
    Oh, killers, huh?

28:02.801 --> 28:04.300
     Yeah, they're called that
    because the first time

28:04.400 --> 28:06.200
        my Uncle Ford ever
          smelled them baking,

28:06.200 --> 28:09.000
  he came running in from the
field and got hit by a combine.

28:11.499 --> 28:13.499
            He hung on
            for a few days.

28:13.599 --> 28:16.798
            At the end,
    he was just praying to die.

28:16.898 --> 28:18.698
      Well, eat up, everybody.

28:21.098 --> 28:23.897
Hey, I don't know
about Indiana,

28:23.997 --> 28:25.397
but around here,
when guys get together

28:25.497 --> 28:27.097
to send another guy
off to his doom,

28:27.097 --> 28:29.196
things can get
a little raunchy...

28:29.296 --> 28:30.596
    (chuckles)

28:30.696 --> 28:32.196
                 You fellas ever
        dress up farm animals

28:32.296 --> 28:34.295
            in women's clothing?

28:36.595 --> 28:39.295
            No.

28:39.395 --> 28:41.094
                 Well, then
             I'm one up on you.

28:43.494 --> 28:46.493
        Woody Harrelson,
tell us about Woody Boyd.

28:46.593 --> 28:48.793
Uh, he likes other people,
        you know,

28:48.793 --> 28:50.793
  and he, he likes connecting
          with people,

28:50.893 --> 28:53.392
and he doesn't really, uh, care

28:53.492 --> 28:56.092
      to, uh, own the bar
      or anything one day.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.791
He just wants to be a bartender
and live in the big city.

28:58.891 --> 29:02.491
Woods, she likes to do her
cushion pushing on four wheels.

29:02.591 --> 29:05.390
                    Miss Howe...
                         really?

29:05.390 --> 29:07.190
              You know, uh, back
              where I come from,

29:07.290 --> 29:09.190
        we used to say something
          about girls like that.

29:09.190 --> 29:09.890
             What?

29:09.990 --> 29:11.789
                Let's date them.
(chuckles)

29:14.589 --> 29:15.589
          Well, actually, Carla,

29:15.689 --> 29:17.788
    as a student of the theater,
    I have to correct you.

29:17.888 --> 29:19.788
     What you were doing there
    is not called acting.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.088
        It's called improvising.

29:21.188 --> 29:22.388
        Shut up, Woody.

29:22.388 --> 29:25.087
Now, that would be directing.

29:27.487 --> 29:32.586
I take it that there's a big
part of you in Woody Boyd.

29:32.686 --> 29:34.786
    Yeah, I would say
the virtue in me is, uh...

29:34.886 --> 29:36.985
        (laughing)

29:38.485 --> 29:40.585
        (chuckles)

29:40.585 --> 29:42.784
          No, I mean,
    we're both very honest.

29:42.784 --> 29:44.284
        Miss Howe, I don't mean
             to insult you,

29:44.384 --> 29:46.084
             but you're looking
            kind of puny.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.284
        Have you lost weight?

29:47.384 --> 29:49.383
Is this a setup?

29:50.583 --> 29:52.683
Did Sam tell you to say that?

29:52.683 --> 29:54.882
        No, ma'am, I told myself
            to say it.

29:54.982 --> 29:57.282
    Thank you, Woody.

29:57.382 --> 30:00.182
    That's the nicest thing
  anyone said to me all week.

30:03.481 --> 30:06.381
        Your hair's been looking
          kind of ratty, too.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.480
  Some people say that they...

30:09.580 --> 30:11.580
      they thought in your
    last couple of episodes,

30:11.580 --> 30:15.979
that you've been a little bit
harsher than you normally are.

30:16.079 --> 30:18.279
            Yeah, I agree,
                by the way.

30:18.279 --> 30:20.378
            Shut up!

30:22.178 --> 30:22.978
        What's the use?

30:23.178 --> 30:24.378
     I don't care anymore.

30:24.478 --> 30:25.677
Don't be bitter.

30:25.777 --> 30:27.677
      I'm not bitter, Sam.

30:27.777 --> 30:30.077
    I'm just consumed
    by a gnawing hate

30:30.077 --> 30:31.576
  that's eating away at my gut

30:31.576 --> 30:33.876
until I can taste the bile
          in my mouth.

30:35.776 --> 30:39.375
         Well, I guess
     I am a little bitter.

30:39.375 --> 30:41.475
 Either that or I'm coming down
        with something.

30:41.575 --> 30:44.274
  Does anybody have a Tic Tac?

30:47.274 --> 30:49.374
             WOMAN:
        I was wondering
     if Woody could perhaps

30:49.374 --> 30:52.173
            recite the lyrics
            to "The Kelly Song"?

30:52.273 --> 30:54.073
  Let me get in the right key.

30:54.173 --> 30:55.373
             Okay.

30:55.473 --> 30:57.972
      ¶ Kelly, my darling,
     you are my sunshine ¶

30:58.072 --> 31:00.372
         (piano plays)

31:00.472 --> 31:04.571
     ¶ When we're together,
         I feel fine ¶

31:04.671 --> 31:07.471
              ¶

31:07.471 --> 31:12.870
¶ Your smile is so lovely,
    your hair is so clean ¶

31:12.970 --> 31:20.569
    ¶ You make me feel that

31:20.668 --> 31:22.768
 ¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

31:22.868 --> 31:24.268
 ¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

31:24.268 --> 31:25.968

31:26.068 --> 31:28.767
         ¶ K-E-L-L-Y

31:28.867 --> 31:30.367
             ¶ Why?
      Because you're... ¶

31:30.467 --> 31:35.266
      ¶ Albania, Albania

31:35.266 --> 31:41.165
 ¶ You border on the Adriatic

31:41.265 --> 31:44.265
     ¶ Good night, ladies

31:44.365 --> 31:46.664
     ¶ Good night, ladies

31:46.764 --> 31:48.564
     ¶ Good night, ladies

31:48.664 --> 31:51.464
¶ We're going to leave you now ¶

31:51.464 --> 31:53.563
         ¶ Time to rap
     about a controversy ¶

31:53.663 --> 31:56.263
     ¶ Gonna take a stand,
     won't show no mercy ¶

31:56.363 --> 31:58.662
    ¶ Lotta folks say
      jocks shouldn't be ¶

31:58.662 --> 32:00.862
¶ Doin' the sports news on TV ¶

32:00.962 --> 32:03.362
     ¶ I don't want to hear
    the latest score ¶

32:03.462 --> 32:05.861
¶ From a punchy old broadcasting
         school board ¶

32:05.961 --> 32:08.261
      ¶ So get your scores
      from a guy like me ¶

32:08.361 --> 32:11.260
¶ Who knows what it's like
    to have a groin injury ¶

32:11.360 --> 32:13.560
    ¶ G-g-groin, g-g-groin

32:13.660 --> 32:16.359
      ¶ G-g-groin injury

32:24.658 --> 32:27.358
             Boola!

32:29.557 --> 32:31.657
The first night of the show,

32:31.757 --> 32:32.957
  I mean, I really realized--

32:33.057 --> 32:35.056
        they introduced
    the cast members--

32:35.056 --> 32:39.656
      and I felt the void
    from the audience.

32:39.656 --> 32:43.155
      It was sort of like
a silent, horrible void...

32:43.255 --> 32:44.355
         to me, I mean,

32:44.455 --> 32:46.655
    maybe I was the only one
     seeing it, hearing it.

32:46.655 --> 32:48.954
         But it was...
      it was for Shelley.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.754
              So right when I...
            after I came out,

32:51.854 --> 32:52.954
      and they, you know,
     they were nice to me,

32:53.054 --> 32:55.353
     yeah, yeah, you know.

32:55.453 --> 32:58.453
"Big deal, we're not gonna
like you no matter what you do."

32:58.553 --> 33:00.152
        (laughing)

33:00.252 --> 33:01.452
    I will prove it to you.

33:01.552 --> 33:04.652
     I will dispel the myth
that you turn my stomach.

33:04.752 --> 33:06.351
 I will give you a little kiss.

33:07.451 --> 33:09.451
             Here.

33:09.551 --> 33:10.751
             There.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.548
Now, what category
am I in?

33:24.648 --> 33:28.548
Yes? No?

33:28.548 --> 33:34.047
Oh, jeez, boy, why do I
even bother with you?

33:34.147 --> 33:36.546
             Whew!

33:36.646 --> 33:38.446
        Definite maybe.

33:39.546 --> 33:41.846
I heard that.

33:41.946 --> 33:43.345
    You said "maybe."

33:43.445 --> 33:44.645
We had an idea for a scene

33:44.745 --> 33:46.545
where she's in the office
  and Sam comes in the office.

33:46.645 --> 33:49.044
They've got a bet that if
he catches her with a cigarette,

33:49.144 --> 33:50.144
  she will go to bed with him.

33:50.244 --> 33:51.544
        A-ha!

33:53.044 --> 33:56.743
        Oh, uh, hey, uh,
    where's the pool table?

33:56.743 --> 33:59.143
        Oh, wrong room.

34:02.942 --> 34:05.242
    She put a lit cigarette
         in her mouth,

34:05.242 --> 34:08.141
  and all of a sudden we went,
"This woman has hidden talents!"

34:09.440 --> 34:11.041
  Oh, Norm, I need your help.

34:11.141 --> 34:12.541
     Oh, you just started.

34:12.641 --> 34:13.639
     You're gonna do fine.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.440
 Things are gonna turn around,
            I swear.

34:15.440 --> 34:19.239
         No, you idiot,
  my hair's stuck to the wall!

34:21.739 --> 34:22.938
It's a huge risk.

34:22.938 --> 34:23.739
                  Take it.

34:23.739 --> 34:25.239
                    Take it.

34:25.239 --> 34:26.538
I'm moving to Tokyo.

34:26.538 --> 34:27.938
I'm gonna take over
the Japanese division.

34:28.038 --> 34:29.038
I leave tonight.

34:29.138 --> 34:32.036
              Yes, darling, yes!

34:32.036 --> 34:33.737
                 Oh...!

34:36.036 --> 34:39.136
            Can I have my drink?

34:39.136 --> 34:41.036
You know, you men
are all alike.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.335
     Yeah, so where was I?

34:50.434 --> 34:53.934
Uh, you were engaged to one of
the richest men in the world.

34:54.034 --> 34:55.234
Could I just have my check?

34:55.234 --> 34:57.033
                  Are you a man?

34:57.033 --> 35:00.233
    Sure.

35:01.733 --> 35:04.132
 I'm gonna have to break it off
          with Robin.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.432
                  Well, it's the
              right thing to do.

35:06.432 --> 35:10.831
  I'll just say to him, um...

35:10.831 --> 35:13.031
    "That's it, sweet baby."

35:17.230 --> 35:19.530
    I think the two of us are
      cut out of the same cloth.

35:19.630 --> 35:21.729
                I think that we,
              perhaps, have a...

35:21.829 --> 35:23.829
            a friendship in the,
                  in the making.

35:23.829 --> 35:25.229
          We may not see it yet,

35:25.329 --> 35:27.828
             but I think we have
        a deep, deep friendship.

35:27.928 --> 35:29.128
                I think we're
                very similar.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.628
Do you think you
share value systems?

35:30.628 --> 35:33.927
                Well, I think
          we're equally shallow.

35:33.927 --> 35:34.827
                    Mr. Colcord.

35:34.827 --> 35:36.027
Rebecca, I'll be brief.

35:36.127 --> 35:37.427
You were very
understanding about that

35:37.527 --> 35:39.127
little incident
back in my limo,

35:39.127 --> 35:40.126
and I think that kind

35:40.226 --> 35:41.426
of understanding
should be rewarded.

35:41.526 --> 35:43.826
 So, I'd like you to have this.

35:48.525 --> 35:49.725
                  (scoffs)

35:52.025 --> 35:53.624
          (whispers):
         It's gorgeous!

36:02.023 --> 36:04.822
                No!

36:04.922 --> 36:07.022
I should like to point out
     that if I had offered

36:07.122 --> 36:08.522
         this bracelet
    to my chargé d'affaires,

36:08.622 --> 36:10.422
  she would have snapped it up
        in a blur.

36:10.522 --> 36:12.321
 Heh, I admire your standards.

36:13.321 --> 36:14.721
     You know,

36:14.821 --> 36:17.120
        this definitely
     puts you in the lead.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.520
  Must go.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.520
Would you care to join me?

36:24.519 --> 36:25.619
    Did you hear that?

36:27.719 --> 36:30.118
         I am winning!

36:30.218 --> 36:31.818
          I'm winning!

36:31.918 --> 36:33.518
                No! Hey, come...
                         listen!

36:33.518 --> 36:34.918
                    Listen to me
              for a second here.

36:35.018 --> 36:36.317
        Come on, you've given up

36:36.417 --> 36:38.917
         something very valuable
             and very important.

36:38.917 --> 36:41.017
        You're gonna regret this
          the rest of your life.

36:41.117 --> 36:43.016
    Oh! You're right.

36:45.316 --> 36:46.716
I will take that bracelet.

36:52.915 --> 36:55.114
              SAM:
     <i>Oh, it's not just</i>
         <i>losing the job.</i>

36:55.214 --> 36:57.914
It's that I was, you know,
taken advantage of.

36:59.014 --> 37:01.513
              I know. I know.

37:01.613 --> 37:03.713
You know,
that I was used.

37:03.813 --> 37:05.013
That I was just...

37:05.113 --> 37:07.512
you know, manipulated
by somebody who just

37:07.612 --> 37:11.212
cynically wanted to get
something from me.

37:13.911 --> 37:16.011
     Malone, what are you doing?

37:16.111 --> 37:18.011
I'm feelin' bad.

37:19.910 --> 37:22.510
             No, you are feeling
                    pretty good.

37:23.910 --> 37:25.509
Okay, I admit it.

37:25.609 --> 37:27.009
I'm not a sad guy.

37:27.109 --> 37:29.009
I'm a happy, horny guy.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.808
         What is Sam's
      philosophy of life?

37:33.908 --> 37:36.008
     Service the queen bee,
        you know, to...

37:39.607 --> 37:41.307
    Look at the two of you!

37:41.407 --> 37:43.206
  No, look at the three of us!

37:44.406 --> 37:46.306
     Let's look at the two
         of you again.

37:48.206 --> 37:50.205
             Can we get a couple
      of piña coladas over here?

37:50.305 --> 37:52.305
Sure thing. Let me just
finish makin' this margarita.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.005
So, anyway, Margarita...

37:57.604 --> 38:00.404
All I can think about is getting
home and jumping into bed.

38:00.504 --> 38:02.803
Need anybody to break your fall?

38:04.803 --> 38:06.603
  Guess who.

38:06.703 --> 38:08.602
            Uh-oh.
I'll give you a hint.

38:08.702 --> 38:10.002
Vermont ski lodge,

38:10.002 --> 38:12.702
a roaring fire and baby oil.

38:12.802 --> 38:16.101
            Uh... could you, uh,
            be more specific?

38:17.601 --> 38:19.101
                Great.

38:19.201 --> 38:20.900
              What time will you
                 be getting off?

38:27.399 --> 38:29.099
You've been with a lot of women.

38:29.199 --> 38:30.199
No, I have not.

38:30.199 --> 38:31.599
There have not
been that many women.

38:31.699 --> 38:33.998
Uh, that gets exaggerated
here in the bar.

38:34.098 --> 38:36.298
There haven't been
that many, really.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.498
How many have there been?

38:38.498 --> 38:39.597
      Well, I don't know.

38:39.697 --> 38:41.297
     Maybe, uh, four hun...

38:41.397 --> 38:42.597
            (gasps):
             Oh...!

38:42.597 --> 38:44.297
      Honeys, honeys.

38:44.397 --> 38:45.596
     Four honeys.

38:45.696 --> 38:47.196
         You know, Sam,

38:47.296 --> 38:49.996
        the church does
    recommend chastity

38:49.996 --> 38:51.395
      to unmarried people.

38:51.495 --> 38:52.695
        (chuckles)

38:54.895 --> 38:56.895
         Oh, I'm sorry.
     You're serious, uh...

38:58.394 --> 39:00.094
For the sake of our friendship,

39:00.094 --> 39:01.894
I am just gonna resist

39:01.994 --> 39:03.993
my sexual urges
and that's all there

39:03.993 --> 39:04.693
      is to it.

39:04.893 --> 39:05.993
      Now, come here.

39:05.993 --> 39:07.993
        There.

39:07.993 --> 39:09.093
        All right.

39:09.193 --> 39:12.292
                You know that
              I loved Evan Drake

39:12.392 --> 39:14.292
            since the first time
                      I met him.

39:14.392 --> 39:15.592
I'm sorry. This is not working.

39:15.691 --> 39:17.091
Hot fire below.

39:21.791 --> 39:25.690
        I can't imagine
    not doing this... show.

39:25.790 --> 39:28.189
             Um...

39:28.189 --> 39:30.289
    I think the thing
     I notice is that, uh,

39:30.389 --> 39:34.288
      when I walk around,
 the incredible, uh, the faces

39:34.288 --> 39:38.288
  of the people that look back
  when they recognize <i>Cheers.</i>

39:38.388 --> 39:41.887
        That, that look
    and that face is, uh...

39:41.987 --> 39:44.287
      coming back at you.

39:44.287 --> 39:46.886
Uh, it's such a privilege
         to walk around

39:46.986 --> 39:50.386
    in that atmosphere
    that it is, uh...

39:50.386 --> 39:53.785
     it's... it's magical.

39:59.584 --> 40:01.784
    ¶ Making your way
      in the world today ¶

40:01.884 --> 40:04.584
¶ Takes everything you've got ¶

40:04.684 --> 40:07.083
        ¶ Taking a break

40:07.183 --> 40:09.983
¶ Sure would help a lot

40:10.083 --> 40:12.882
      ¶ Wouldn't you like
         to get away? ¶

40:16.382 --> 40:19.181
    ¶ All those nights
  when you've got no lights ¶

40:19.281 --> 40:21.881
  ¶ The check is in the mail

40:21.981 --> 40:25.580
    ¶ And your little angel
    hung the cat up ¶

40:25.680 --> 40:27.980
    ¶ By its tail...

40:28.080 --> 40:31.079
    ¶ And your third fiancé
         didn't show ¶

40:32.979 --> 40:35.579
  ¶ Sometimes you want to go

40:35.679 --> 40:39.078
    ¶ Where everybody
    knows your name ¶

40:40.578 --> 40:44.477
      ¶ And they're always
        glad you came ¶

40:45.777 --> 40:48.077
         ¶ You wanna be
      where you can see ¶

40:48.177 --> 40:50.276
    ¶ Our troubles are
         all the same ¶

40:50.276 --> 40:55.375
 ¶ You wanna be where everybody
    knows your name ¶

40:58.975 --> 41:01.174
     ¶ You roll out of bed,
      Mr. Coffee's dead ¶

41:01.274 --> 41:04.374
¶ The morning's looking bright ¶
  ¶ <i>Morning's looking bright</i> ¶

41:04.474 --> 41:06.773
    ¶ And your shrink
      ran off to Europe ¶

41:06.773 --> 41:09.573
¶ And didn't even write ¶

41:09.673 --> 41:13.272
    ¶ And your husband
      wants to be a girl ¶

41:14.972 --> 41:17.672
  ¶ Be glad there's one place
         in the world ¶

41:17.672 --> 41:21.071
    ¶ Where everybody
    knows your name ¶

41:22.471 --> 41:26.270
      ¶ And they're always
        glad you came ¶

41:27.570 --> 41:30.170
         ¶ You wanna go
      where people know ¶

41:30.270 --> 41:32.569
  ¶ People are all the same

41:32.669 --> 41:36.469
 ¶ You wanna go where everybody
    knows your name ¶

41:38.568 --> 41:40.368
              ¶

41:46.767 --> 41:49.667
    ¶ Where everybody
    knows your name ¶

41:49.767 --> 41:51.566

42:14.762 --> 42:16.062
I'll tell you what you do.

42:16.162 --> 42:17.562
        Why don't you...

42:17.662 --> 42:19.062
         Hey, would you
    get out of here?!

42:19.062 --> 42:21.061
              Go on!

42:22.561 --> 42:25.961
Cheers to <i>Cheers</i> on your 200th.

42:25.961 --> 42:29.260
        Looking forward
