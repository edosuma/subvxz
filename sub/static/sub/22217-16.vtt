[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.680 --> 00:18.685
My offer says Carrington Atlantic shares
are yours once we're legally married.

00:18.768 --> 00:22.397
-Looks legal to me.
-Bigamy is illegal in Georgia.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.315
-[Fallon] You in the market?
-For what?

00:24.399 --> 00:26.067
Biggest payday of your life.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.697
This is Liam, my husband.
My marriage is completely legal,

00:30.780 --> 00:33.742
which means ours isn't,
and neither is my contract.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.827
Unless we're married, my gift is void.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.830
I'm not gonna let an expired visa
keep us apart.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.458
I'd like to report
an undocumented immigrant.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.043
-[Cecil] Carrington.
-What the hell?

00:45.128 --> 00:48.381
-I'm having a heart attack.
-What did you do?

00:48.465 --> 00:50.383
We need to get out of here. Go.

00:53.845 --> 00:57.182
[Anders] Wedding to the left,
funeral to the right.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.059
Wedding to the left--

00:59.142 --> 01:02.479
Ah. Congratulations or condolences?
This side. Thank you.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.983
And that can go directly
to Mr. Carrington.

01:07.067 --> 01:07.901
I'll take it.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.404
[Anders] Funeral to this side, thank you.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.913
I didn't hear you come to bed last night.
Did you get any sleep?

01:19.996 --> 01:24.626
No. I was on the phone with London,
Sydney, Shanghai...

01:25.335 --> 01:29.130
Carrington Atlantic's
chairman of the board died 48 hours ago.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.217
-So did your father.
-Our clients need to know

01:32.300 --> 01:36.262
-operations won't be interrupted.
-I'll handle it. You need to grieve.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.639
I'm fine.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.477
-What do you want me to do, cry?
-If that's what you need, yes.

01:43.102 --> 01:47.565
Blake, you don't have to be a soldier now.
You can talk to me. Or someone.

01:47.649 --> 01:52.195
I don't need a therapist. I just need
to talk to my pipeline manager in Dubai.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.199
If you wanna talk about feelings,
go do it somewhere else.

01:58.993 --> 02:02.288
One hundred thousand,
that's the number we agreed upon.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.500
-And a time frame?
-We didn't settle on a hard number.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.377
-Annulment versus divorce?
-Didn't get that far.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.003
A nondisclosure agreement?

02:10.088 --> 02:12.799
This wasn't my finest hour
as a business person

02:12.882 --> 02:14.134
or a "person" person.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.470
I know the risks of marrying a stranger,
so I hired you.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.806
Good news is you haven't paid him yet.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.227
We'll draw up the papers immediately
and have Liam sign them today.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.771
If only my other fake marriage
was so simple.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.607
What are you doing about Jeff?
Cristal Carrington.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.525
My stepmother.

02:30.608 --> 02:34.362
-Jackie Littman.
-My divorce lawyer. There's nothing to do.

02:34.445 --> 02:38.324
I'll lay low for a few weeks,
let the wedding coverage blow over,

02:38.408 --> 02:42.328
-and tell a few people it didn't work out.
-What about the funeral?

02:42.412 --> 02:45.790
Yeah, I didn't plan on Grandpa tapping out
at the wedding.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.879
-People are gonna ask questions.
-I don't want him answering them.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.841
-You should say something first.
-I don't wanna piss him off, either.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.176
At least, not before Liam signs the NDA.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.805
I doubt Jeff wants the truth out there
any more than you do.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.475
If you get ahead of the questions,
offer an innocent explanation,

03:04.559 --> 03:06.394
blame yourself even...

03:07.770 --> 03:09.355
you'd be doing him a favor.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.566
What do you mean? Say I got cold feet?

03:11.649 --> 03:15.153
In light of what happened,
who could blame you?

03:15.236 --> 03:17.322
Death has a way of giving us clarity.

03:17.405 --> 03:20.158
Maybe you realized
you weren't ready for marriage.

03:20.283 --> 03:24.495
If there's anything Grandpa wanted,
it was for me to get away from Jeff.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.414
[theme music playing]

03:27.999 --> 03:30.126
I'll put out a statement this morning.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.045
[knocking on door]

03:34.088 --> 03:34.923
What?

03:37.508 --> 03:38.635
Your mail.

03:40.261 --> 03:44.349
-See you haven't forgotten the address.
-I was wondering where these were.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.602
Apologies for the delay.
I've had more important matters

03:47.685 --> 03:50.897
to attend to over the last few days
than your shopping.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.216
I admire your reputation
for representing women.

04:18.966 --> 04:23.304
It's not always where the money is,
but especially these days,

04:23.388 --> 04:26.391
-we have to stick together, don't we?
-We do.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.061
-I didn't mean--
-No, of course not.

04:30.144 --> 04:33.523
But if you have any friends who do,
have them give me a call?

04:35.650 --> 04:38.820
-Of course. Thank you.
-Sure.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.787
Per Mr. Carrington's
last will and testament,

04:47.870 --> 04:50.832
his instructions for his funeral
are as follows:

04:50.915 --> 04:55.044
"He's to be dressed in a plain black suit
from Harrow &amp; Sons in London,

04:55.128 --> 04:59.340
-and placed in a simple oak casket."
-A man of the people till the very end.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.927
"White Miltonia orchids
will fill the sanctuary, and the casket

05:03.011 --> 05:05.513
will be taken to Oakland Cemetery
in a hearse

05:05.596 --> 05:09.475
drawn by a team of Belgian black horses
accompanied by a brass band."

05:10.059 --> 05:12.854
-Spoke too soon.
-Not like he's here to enjoy it.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.232
Everyone deserves a last hurrah,
don't they?

05:17.066 --> 05:20.069
Fine. Anders,
I trust you can handle the arrangements?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.779
Not all of them, I'm afraid.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.950
-What?
-He's asked that his grandchildren

05:26.034 --> 05:30.246
perform a song for the congregation,
as he so loved in life,

05:30.330 --> 05:34.042
and that he be buried
with his copy of <i>The Canterbury Tales.</i>

05:34.125 --> 05:37.795
-It's in his personal library in Savannah.
-You can send somebody.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.048
He wanted you to retrieve it.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.966
-From Savannah?
-Yes.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.761
Absolutely not. There's too much going on.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.638
I'm not going to that house
to pick up an old book.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.682
He specifically instructed--

05:49.766 --> 05:53.728
I don't care what he instructed!
He ordered me around his whole life.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.815
He will not do it from beyond the grave.
I don't have to listen anymore.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.151
You know what? I'm glad.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.408
That is no way to speak
about your father.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.202
[theme music playing]

06:17.502 --> 06:20.004
I'm walking Liam through
what we went over.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.925
-Yeah. Just tell me where to sign.
-Right. The nondisclosure here.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.512
And the petition for annulment.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.936
You're the best first wife I ever had.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.395
[chuckles]

06:36.979 --> 06:41.734
Only until tomorrow. Once we get this
to a judge and get everything finalized,

06:41.818 --> 06:44.654
it will be as if
you were never married at all.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.784
Oh.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.879
-Guess I should cancel the registry.
-[laughs]

07:01.963 --> 07:06.425
-I had my eye on these pineapple skewers.
-Wow. Now you can afford the whole set.

07:06.509 --> 07:10.012
Yeah, or I could just buy the kebab place
around the corner.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.933
You hungry? My treat.
Well... [scoffs] technically it's yours.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.811
-I don't really do food on sticks.
-Seriously?

07:17.937 --> 07:21.065
What about popsicles? Chicken satay?
Corn dogs?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.860
-What the hell is that?
-They're delicious.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.821
-You know he was doing this?
-[woman on TV] <i>We're with Jeff Colby.</i>

07:26.904 --> 07:28.781
<i>-Thanks for having us.</i>
-[Jeff] <i>Of course.</i>

07:28.865 --> 07:33.286
Earlier today, Fallon Carrington released
a statement announcing you had split,

07:33.369 --> 07:35.413
only two days after your wedding.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.374
I thought I'd found my soul mate,

07:39.333 --> 07:40.751
the woman of my dreams.

07:41.335 --> 07:44.589
Fallon lied to me.
We were never married in the first place.

07:45.381 --> 07:49.260
And her statement today
makes me question her grip on reality

07:49.510 --> 07:52.597
-<i>and her ability to run Morell Corp.</i>
-What is he doing?

07:53.181 --> 07:54.515
Declaring war.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.894
[theme music playing]

08:16.329 --> 08:17.288
What did you do?

08:18.372 --> 08:21.918
What did I do? See the statement
Fallon put out this morning?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.921
She straight up lied.
And if you think I'm--

08:25.004 --> 08:27.882
Why do you care?
She didn't bring your name into it.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.676
She didn't say you signed over Morell,
or ColbyCo.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.763
She stole them.
She committed fraud and she knows it.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.808
You didn't? You played the same game.
You just can't admit you lost.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.394
-Whose team are you on here?
-Ours.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.232
What you lost is only money,
but we got our father back. -Why would you jeopardize that?
-Wanna talk to me about Dad?

08:48.611 --> 08:52.031
-You have no idea how much I protect him.
-Of course, I do.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.951
You know he pulled a gun
on Thomas Carrington?

08:55.493 --> 08:56.577
-What?
-Yeah.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.664
He gave him a heart attack, Moni.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.333
The old guy was literally killed
by his racism.

09:02.416 --> 09:06.337
But you didn't know, because
I got Dad out of there. I protected him.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.507
All the more reason
for you to be careful now.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.761
Drop this, before you're the one
who destroys our family.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.846
[theme music playing]

09:22.728 --> 09:26.190
-Hey. What's going on?
-Besides Anders slapping my dad?

09:26.274 --> 09:28.234
What? Why?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.571
Let's just say they're grieving
in different ways.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.614
How about you?

09:35.324 --> 09:37.410
I'm not sure what to be feeling.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.539
Grandpa and I didn't exactly have
the easiest relationship.

09:42.123 --> 09:47.003
The irony is, after all that struggle,
I'm the only one who got closure with him.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.673
-You deserve it, Steven.
-My dad's still so angry at him.

09:51.007 --> 09:55.511
Maybe I should be, too. Mostly,
I'd rather celebrate the silver lining.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.264
-Is that weird?
-I think it's kind of beautiful.

10:01.017 --> 10:01.851
Thanks. What's this?

10:12.069 --> 10:14.488
Deported? Seriously, Sam, what is this?

10:14.572 --> 10:18.909
They know I'm here without papers.
I don't know how they found out.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.162
-Well, except...
-What?

10:21.787 --> 10:25.124
It could have been Jeff Colby.
From my Morell paperwork.

10:25.207 --> 10:28.002
Maybe he thought
it would hurt Fallon somehow?

10:29.253 --> 10:33.174
-Why didn't you say something?
-Everyone has enough on their plate.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.635
Doesn't mean you should do this alone.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.137
We're in this together.
We'll figure it out.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.848
-Did you call a lawyer?
-Yes, and it's not good.

10:40.931 --> 10:44.644
I can't just say I forgot to renew
my visa. I got fake papers.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.897
The system's not exactly famous
for gray areas, so...

10:47.980 --> 10:51.192
Well... we just have to beat the system.

10:54.695 --> 10:55.571
You all right?

10:56.822 --> 10:59.742
Will you stop asking me that? I'm fine.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.913
If anything, Anders needs to see a shrink.

11:03.996 --> 11:08.084
I know he had an attachment to my father.
I've known him since I was born.

11:08.167 --> 11:13.214
He taught me to shave. That's why I let
it slide. But I do not need an employee

11:13.756 --> 11:16.467
or a ghost telling me what to do.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.928
You're right.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.555
Your father was a miserable man.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.517
I certainly never heard
a kind word from him.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.604
As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't
deserve another moment of your life.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.565
Well, thank you.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.317
But you can't move on

11:33.943 --> 11:37.113
and nothing can move forward
if you don't go to Savannah.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.909
The longer you fight him,
the longer you let him loom over you.

11:42.493 --> 11:46.122
The sooner you get this over with,
the sooner you can be free.

11:52.294 --> 11:56.882
Where do you get off? Calling me a liar?
After everything that you've done?

11:57.049 --> 12:02.304
You lied. To me, to the entire Internet.
I didn't invent that marriage license.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.725
You bugged my house, puppeted my brother,
proposed to me to get to my father.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.729
I didn't start this war, you did.
When are you gonna admit you lost it?

12:11.647 --> 12:13.649
You think you've won? [scoffs]

12:13.732 --> 12:18.362
You spent seven figures on a fake wedding
and gave your grandfather a heart attack.

12:18.446 --> 12:22.825
-What's Grandfather have to do with this?
-You think it's a coincidence?

12:22.908 --> 12:25.995
You ran with this charade,
collateral damage be damned.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.788
And for what, some shares?

12:28.914 --> 12:32.918
It's all gonna be for nothing.
I'm gonna take back everything you stole.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.045
Starting with this office.

12:36.964 --> 12:41.510
I'll leave your things outside. Shame
this is all that's left of your company.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.805
This is what you killed him for.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.732
Wanna carry this yourself?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.611
-Guess not.
-Look me in the eye and say it again.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.198
What? That you're the reason
your grandfather is dead?

13:03.949 --> 13:07.786
Ho, ho. Here we go. Poor little rich girl
shows her true colors.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.332
Hope you got a good look,
'cause it'll be a cold day in hell

13:11.415 --> 13:14.418
-before you ever see them again!
-What the hell?

13:16.003 --> 13:17.338
You wanna gaslight me?

13:18.005 --> 13:20.049
I will set the gasoline on fire.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.385
[theme music playing]

13:39.235 --> 13:43.739
-I'm sorry to hear about your grandfather.
-That's very kind. Thank you.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.201
But a pleasant surprise to hear from you.
Are you holding up?

13:47.660 --> 13:51.914
We're all muddling through. I hope
you and Paul can come to the service.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.626
Yes, of course. Thomas was a good friend
to us for many years.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.922
-If there's anything we can do...
-That's actually why I'm here.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.133
I was hoping you could help me.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.096
-What is it?
-It's my stepmother's nephew. Sam?

14:07.388 --> 14:09.848
He has to appear
before an immigration judge.

-What I should've done a long time ago.
