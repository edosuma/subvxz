- You are not just a mom.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.126
You are a hot, hot, single lady.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.004
(chuckling)
(clicking)

01:31.240 --> 01:33.322
Oh, God.
- Mom!

01:33.440 --> 01:35.329
- Just a second, sweetie!

01:36.720 --> 01:40.202
You are a well-educated... female person...

01:40.320 --> 01:42.607
with a very big...

01:42.720 --> 01:44.131
set of tits.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.080
- Mommy!
- Fuck me. Coming!

01:51.320 --> 01:55.609
- All right, Momma's bringing in
the big board. Let's do this.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.286
Gracie, do you have
your show-and-tell, honey?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.165
Yes, you do. Good girl!

02:01.280 --> 02:03.567
Will, buddy, helmet and pads?

02:04.600 --> 02:07.046
Are those boys still giving you
a hard time at practice?

02:09.199 --> 02:11.441
Okay, well, screw football.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.484
How about glee club, huh?
Show tunes!

02:17.880 --> 02:21.601
- Mommy, can we listen to singing music
on the way to school?

02:21.720 --> 02:24.087
- No, honey, I like to listen
to news in the morning.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.567
- Can I play on your phone?
- Nope.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.529
(child screaming)
Amelia!

02:30.640 --> 02:33.325
You know we don't do screams
before school.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.125
- He took his diaper off! Poop!

02:36.240 --> 02:38.846

04:15.760 --> 04:18.206
- Good afternoon, Jen.
Gorgeous day we're having, huh?

04:18.360 --> 04:21.091
Got that sun dialled up to a 10.
(chuckling)

04:21.200 --> 04:25.000
- It is. It's so bright out,
do you really need that flashlight?

04:25.120 --> 04:27.930
- I probably wouldn't have seen
Greyson pick his nose and wipe it

04:28.040 --> 04:31.681
on the back of your seat without it, huh?
Don't worry. They all do it.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.370
I got you.
- Oh.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.005
- Hey!
- Shit!

04:35.120 --> 04:38.966
- Owen is begging for a play date
with the boys. You gotta come over.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.924
- Oh! Oh, hey,
uh, this is the call I'm expecting.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.485
Silent. It's on silent.
(whistle blowing)

04:47.120 --> 04:48.485
- Hey, Sally.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.365
- Whoa, uh...
- Orange cones, no phones.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.010
- I was buying milk. I'm out of milk.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.936
- Well, there's a Trader Joe's
right around the corner.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.480
- Yeah, well,
I don't do markets, okay?

04:57.560 --> 04:59.210
So please just give me my phone, Melissa.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.806
Uh, uh, Melody.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.604
I mean...
- It's Melanie, Kate.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.564
God, we've been going to the same school
for five years?

05:06.680 --> 05:09.923
- Just give me my phone, please, Melanie.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.924
Hey, what the...?

05:13.080 --> 05:15.287
- Are those car seats
even installed properly?

05:15.400 --> 05:18.051
And does this beauty
even have anti-lock brakes?

05:18.160 --> 05:20.527
- Yes. Obviously it does.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.529
And power windows.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.364
- Seriously?

05:30.400 --> 05:33.051
(upbeat music)

05:33.160 --> 05:35.891
- We had a big day
and then Teacher Sherry

05:36.000 --> 05:38.844
witnessed Amelia offering her spot
on the green rug.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.965
The empathy that displays,
Amelia, it's... it's profound.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.450
Come on, you two get in here.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.246
You both are settling in beautifully
to your first month at school. Aren't you?

05:50.360 --> 05:51.964
- Yeah.
- Bit of a relief. Right?

05:52.120 --> 05:54.521
- Yes. All right, bug, come on.
Let's go get our stuff, huh?

05:54.640 --> 05:57.325
- Have an amazing day. So great to see you.
- Thank you. You too.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.286
- Yay! Okay, hold still.
- Oh, that's one cute cubby.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.004
(chuckling)

06:03.120 --> 06:05.885
Rose-budding really takes it
to the next level.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.286
- Rose-budding!

06:07.400 --> 06:09.323
Ooh, that'll get a lot of likes, right?

06:09.440 --> 06:10.783
Now I get the iPad, Mommy?

06:10.808 --> 06:13.389
As soon as we get in
the car, sweetie, okay?

06:13.480 --> 06:16.165
As soon as we get in the car.
And don't forget,

06:16.280 --> 06:18.601
you get to sleep
at your daddy's house tonight,

06:18.720 --> 06:20.882
and Mommy gets some alone time.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.809
- Can't even remember what that's like.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.646
- Hey, I know this is kind of last minute,
but Melanie - you know, Grace's mom? -

06:27.760 --> 06:29.808
she and I are going out tomorrow night.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.605
I got us a reservation
in this new tapas place.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.529
Would you wanna join?
- Uh, topless?

06:34.640 --> 06:37.644
- Yeah, topless place. I thought, you know,
sexy dancers, little appetizers.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.364
No. Tapas.
- Oh, my God!

06:39.480 --> 06:41.448
- Tapas.
- Tapas!

06:41.560 --> 06:44.928
Yeah, no, tapas. Wow, yeah,
that would be really nice. Thank you.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.691
- Yeah, we like to do these fun mom dinners
every couple of weeks.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.763
Lots of wine, no kids.
It's kind of heaven.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.325
- Yeah, sounds like it.
- Hi, ladies.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.808
- Hey, Mel, guess what. Emily is gonna
join us for dinner tomorrow night.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.285
- Oh, fantastic.
- Ls that okay?

06:56.400 --> 06:59.370
- Yeah, it's great. I love welcoming
new moms to the Happy Days community.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.363
I can't wait to hear your story, Emily.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.887
- Um, would it be okay if I invited Kate?

07:05.840 --> 07:07.524
- Kate with the twin boys?
- Yeah.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.047
Wait. Are you
friends with her?

07:09.072 --> 07:11.225
Yeah, yeah, we went to
high school together.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.927
That's how I got Amelia in here
so last minute when we moved.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.567
- Kate doesn't usually do stuff
with us other moms,

07:18.680 --> 07:22.287
or even return my emails, but I know she got
it, 'cause I have that sent-return thing.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.767
But since you guys are so close,
if you wanna invite her,

07:24.920 --> 07:26.888
I mean, that's fine,
she could come with us, yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.256
- That'd be wonderful.
- Okay, no, I'll mention it to her later.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.680
That sounds great. Thank you, guys.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.529
Gotta go. Bye. Thank you.
- Bye.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.809
- I like your skirt. It's so pretty.
- Oh, thanks.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.527
- I bet my left tit
that bitch Kate doesn't come.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.889
- Hello, gorgeous.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.882
(Lucas): Shut up!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.162
Mom!!
(Henry): He took it!

07:58.280 --> 08:00.886
(pounding)
(Lucas): I'm in the playoff!

08:01.040 --> 08:03.611
Where are you?!
(door handle jiggling)

08:03.720 --> 08:06.166
(boys shouting)

08:06.280 --> 08:08.203
Where are you?!

08:08.320 --> 08:10.129
(Pounding)
(Shouting)

08:17.480 --> 08:19.209
(screaming)
- Whoa, whoa!

08:19.320 --> 08:21.561
One at a time, dudes, one at a time.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.524
- Make them shut up, okay?
I'm in the playoffs!

08:24.640 --> 08:28.611
- The twins knocked over my Legos
and I have to poop.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.405
- Oh, get in there, go. Get in there, go.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.683
- He took my sabre!
- Because it's mine!

08:34.799 --> 08:36.563
- Okay-

08:39.080 --> 08:40.969
There you go. Downstairs.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.770
Have fun.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.609
Daddy's calling you.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.404
(sighing)

08:46.520 --> 08:48.522
(phone ringing)

08:51.520 --> 08:53.492
Hey. Sorry I couldn't
talk to you at pick-up.

08:53.517 --> 08:55.230
I can't take hanging
around that place.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.086
- <i>Oh, guess who got</i> a <i>poop facial
and taught our kid how to say the F word?</i>

08:59.200 --> 09:03.569
- Oh, wait, you had shit on your face
and you're worried

09:03.680 --> 09:06.047
<i>your kid learned the word fuck?
- You don't understand.</i>

09:06.160 --> 09:08.891
I never swear in front
of them, is the thing.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.130
- <i>Shit, I'd be more worried</i> about <i>pink eye.</i>
- <i>How is it possible that this kid</i>

09:13.280 --> 09:15.169
still has the S-H-I-T-S?

09:15.320 --> 09:17.800
- Well, now you know
what you're really missing out on

09:17.920 --> 09:19.684
when you're pulling
those 12-hour workdays.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.087
- It's incredible to me
that my life still revolves

09:22.200 --> 09:25.090
around other people's S-H-I-T.
I can't believe it.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.770
- Oh, I can.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.049
- You're good at this.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.164
Do it again?
- Okay.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.611
- I love it, Emily.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.206
You look beautiful.
- Oh, really?

09:38.320 --> 09:40.482
I feel like you've never
seen me with my hair brushed.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.291
- Hey, I'm home. Hey...
- Hey.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.402
- Daddy's home!
- Oh, Amelia Bedelia!

09:45.560 --> 09:47.722
How you doing?
Oh, my goodness.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.287
Oh, gosh, are we busy
making some drawings here?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.851
What the...?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.804
Wow, honey, this is, um...

09:55.920 --> 09:57.684
this is an interesting one.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.326
Wh-what exactly is going on here?

10:00.440 --> 10:03.125
- It's a whale spraying Mommy.
- Um...

10:03.240 --> 10:06.164
I... I guess I didn't know Mommy
was into that sort of thing,

10:06.280 --> 10:08.601
but, uh, okay.
(laughing)

10:08.720 --> 10:10.722
All right.
(baby fussing)

10:11.800 --> 10:13.484
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.410
Okay, I'm gonna, uh...
I'll just get changed and...

10:17.760 --> 10:21.367
- He's got this thing
about messing up my lipstick.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.929
- Is this, like, Top Chef or something? Are
we gonna be judged on our work? Thank you.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.644
- No, it's a delivery thing, man.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.001
It's a startup,
which I should've invested in.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.168
It's all local and organic and sustainable.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.721
And they just drop it off for you.

10:36.840 --> 10:40.526
- What drops it off, an electric tractor
being pulled by a rescue dog?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.369
(Kate laughing)
Thanks, Kate.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.528
- This is literally farm
to table, you guys.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.608
Farm to table.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.041
- Straight from the farm.
- Straight to the table.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.084
- To the...
- Right to the table. Are you kidding me?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.009
- There's no middleman.
- Oh, my God.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.043
Well, thank you so much for having us over

10:56.160 --> 10:58.367
so we could make our own dinner.
This is great.

10:58.480 --> 11:03.168
- Kate, I think it's awesome,
I think it's super creative, and I like it.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.648
- Thanks, Em.
- Don't cut yourself, now.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.049
- All right. Let's do this. Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.004
Right. Do you wanna do the...
chop up the veggies?

11:14.120 --> 11:15.645
- What's up with the sauce?

11:15.760 --> 11:17.888
- Just a little...
- Oh, no, no, no, hold on.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.721
Throw the veggies in first
and then the sauce goes...

11:21.840 --> 11:24.650
- I think it'll just...
- No, no. It's like this for a reason.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.570
You know, sometimes, recipes are
in a specific order for a reason.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.921
It's gonna screw the whole thing up if...
- Ahem.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.402
- It cooks together... Okay, it's fine.
- Did you guys...

11:33.520 --> 11:35.761
Do you have any
of that yellow sauce leftover?

11:35.920 --> 11:38.287
- Mm-hmm, yep.
- Kind of wasted all of ours.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.640
Um...

11:39.800 --> 11:42.883
Yeah, I think, uh,
this move's gonna be great for us.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.365
- Yeah.
- And great for us, Em.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.847
We get to hang like the old times,
just the girls.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.566
- Speaking of just the girls,
a couple of the moms from school

11:49.680 --> 11:51.489
asked me out for a fun mom dinner.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.490
- That sounds awful.
- Hey, it's a fun mom dinner.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.206
How can it not be, you know, fun?

11:57.360 --> 11:59.840
- Shut the fuck up, hon.
Which ones were they?

11:59.960 --> 12:01.450
- One of them was named Jamie.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.006
- I know her. I mean,
I don't "know" know her.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.810
I follow her on Instagram.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.809
She's a bit of an over-sharer.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.447
- Seriously, Andrew? Jesus, I mean,
some wives would be pissed about this.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.245
I think I'm just embarrassed for you. Here.
- Whoa.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.681
- #sharedcustody?

12:16.800 --> 12:19.326
# metime?

12:19.440 --> 12:22.284
Fuck, if it's me time,
why feel the need to share it with us?

12:22.400 --> 12:23.576
Who's the other mom?
- Melanie.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.364
- Okay, that woman is bat-shit crazy.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.643
I think she runs a fight club
in the Helping Hand yard.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.525
- No, they're trying to be nice.
- You have to get out of it.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.040
Just say Wyatt's sick or something.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.323
- No, don't listen to her, Em.
And you should go too, babe.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.450
- Honey, I think this is great.
You should make more friends,

12:39.560 --> 12:41.562
you should, you know, widen your circle.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.967
(both): Widen your circle?
- That's super sexual.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.481
- Yeah, maybe it is sexual. So what?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.046
- You're just gonna widen it,
take a look around.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.089
- Oh! Speaking...

12:51.200 --> 12:55.569
of sexual innuendo...
look what I found in the move.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.887
- What is it?
- Oh, my God.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.721
It's our sex questionnaire
from sophomore year.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.882
- We answered every
question with Jake Ryan.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.482
Yes! And it marked the birth
of the I Love Jake Club.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.371
- The I love who?
- Jake Ryan from Sixteen Candles.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.962
That was our movie.
Jake Ryan is like the perfect guy.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.625
I've never heard
about any of this.

13:15.650 --> 13:17.665
There were two presidents
and two members.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.366
- You guys started a club
and there's only two people in it?

13:20.480 --> 13:23.962
(laughter)
That's adorable and sad. Let me see this.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.209
- Yeah, you two can't be in the club.
- What?!

13:46.440 --> 13:47.851
<i>- HEY-
- HEY-</i>

13:53.240 --> 13:54.844
- All yours.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.611
You wanna watch a little John Oliver?

14:09.280 --> 14:10.850
- No.

14:13.680 --> 14:18.163
Oh, hey, would you mind taking Amelia
to school tomorrow so I can go work out?

14:18.280 --> 14:20.886
- No... fucking... way.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.082
- What?
(Tom laughing)

14:24.080 --> 14:25.684
" Mommy!

14:30.280 --> 14:32.726
- Hey, shhh, shhh, shhh...

14:33.720 --> 14:35.290
Mommy's here.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.167
Don't forget to go pee-pee.
Remember last time?

14:57.280 --> 15:00.602
- Did you really just tell me to go pee-pee?
- I did.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.610
- 'Cause I don't have to. I came prepared.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.690
- Oh!
- Sam's pull-up is tight as fuck!

15:06.840 --> 15:08.171
- Oh, that is so wrong.

15:08.280 --> 15:12.126
- You push out two more kids
and see if you don't need one.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.204
Hey, what's going on with you?

15:16.320 --> 15:17.810
Tom stuff again?

15:17.920 --> 15:19.285
- No.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.811
Yes.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.605
- You seemed happy last night.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.803
Please tell me you went home and
had drunk sex. Oh, please, hardly.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.491
Tom has zero interest in sex. Forget sex.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.251
I haven't had a hug in months.
- Oh.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.648
- The last hug I got, I think,
was from Teacher Sherry.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.444
Kind of felt a little something.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.404
(techno music blasting)
- Okay, ladies, positions, please.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.648
Come on, ladies, positions, please.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.922
- We need to talk about this.
- Dinner tonight?

15:45.040 --> 15:47.486
- I wanna see those knees to cheeks.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.888
Five, six, seven, eight, and go down, down,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.970
down, down, down, down!
That's it. Ugh!

15:55.080 --> 15:58.163
- Good thing this is an overnight.
- Whoo!

15:58.280 --> 16:00.851
Ooh, down, down, down! Ooh, higher!

16:00.960 --> 16:03.691
Let me hear you say whoo!

16:03.800 --> 16:05.768
(all): Whoo!
- Whoo!

16:09.600 --> 16:13.321
- I do not get this.
Do you know how to do Instagram?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.090
I'm stuck.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.891
Hey, good timing.
I just got a text from Kate a minute ago

16:18.000 --> 16:20.287
who's gonna be here in five, so...
- Oh, I texted Andrew.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.562
We're gonna go hang out
over there for a bit.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.365
- Oh, are you sure it's a good idea,
'cause it's a school night,

16:25.480 --> 16:29.371
and you know if Wyatt falls asleep in
the car, he's never gonna transfer.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.916
It will be great, babe.
The kids'll have fun.

16:31.941 --> 16:33.475
Oh, fun, what a concept.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.564
- No, you don't get to do
the "we never have fun anymore" thing.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.291
I'm babysitting tonight
so you can go out and have fun.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.845
- You're babysitting, Tom?!
- Yeah.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.531
- It's not babysitting
when they're your kids.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.484
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's parenting.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.040
- You're splitting hairs there,
but, yeah, sure, I mean, both.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.645
- His green blanket is in the dryer.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.491
Do not forget it if you go out.
You'll be so sorry.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.331
Are you listening
to any of this right now?

16:56.440 --> 16:59.523
- Come on. Uh, yeah, yeah,
the diaper and the, um,

16:59.640 --> 17:01.449
the blankets, it's no problem.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.801
- Okay.
- All right, you know what?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.648
I need to take a quick shower.
- All right.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.922
Good luck with that.
(baby fussing)

17:08.040 --> 17:10.122
Have a good night.
- Okay.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.924
(baby crying)
- Goodbye.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.530
Good bye.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.723
- But I was just thinking
I needed to take a quick shower.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.047
(UP-tempo music)

17:24.839 --> 17:26.490
(laughter)

17:28.800 --> 17:30.370
- Please.
- What?

17:30.480 --> 17:32.687
- Tell me you didn't do this.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.165
(sighing)

17:34.320 --> 17:36.482
- I kind Of did.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.760
- Looks like your classic ambush move.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.451
- That Emily is sneaky.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.210
- I like her.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.371
- I thought this was just gonna be
the two of us,

17:48.480 --> 17:50.562
talking about you and Tom
and shitty life stuff.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.409
- I know. I didn't wanna come alone.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.126
I'm sorry I tricked you, okay?

17:55.240 --> 17:58.130
I just wanted a night
where I am not thinking about Tom.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.004
I need it

18:01.640 --> 18:04.928
- Oprah? Gayle?
Care to open up your friendship circle?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.769
Let's go, come on.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.565
- One hour, that is it.
And you fucking owe me.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.091
- Come on.
- I love you.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.964
- Melanie, you look hot.
- You look great.

18:13.080 --> 18:16.129
- I mean, what else are we
supposed to bring to snack share?

18:16.280 --> 18:19.443
I mean, we've got three kids
allergic to gluten, a tree nut,

18:19.560 --> 18:23.121
two soys,
and that kid with the zipper thing?

18:23.240 --> 18:25.891
- Oh, that kid is not allergic to zippers.
No fucking way.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.441
- But it's on the list.
- He's just scared of them.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.164
That's more of an emotional allergy.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.248
- Yes, I did the ROTC thing in college,

18:32.360 --> 18:35.364
and I came this close to joining
the Armed Forces, you know?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.164
I still think about it.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.806
You cannot get me out of my 'tigues
on the weekends.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.969
- I miss telling people at parties
that I was a lawyer, you know?

18:43.080 --> 18:47.608
Except for I never went to parties, because
I never left the office before 9:00.

18:47.720 --> 18:52.009
And then there was, like, the rare occasion
that I did make it home by bedtime,

18:52.120 --> 18:54.521
and Amelia was calling her nanny "Mama."

18:54.640 --> 18:59.009
- Now that Lexie is with Theo part of the
time, I actually have time to myself.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.407
So I started consulting
with this engineering firm.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.602
Plus I'm training for a half-marathon,

19:03.720 --> 19:06.803
and I get to sleep -
and I'm talking real sleep.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.400
- That is why you look so good.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.241
You know, she would never admit it,
but she was my saving grace.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.522
Some of my friends got so weird
after I got separated.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.802
You would not believe,
once you're single,

19:17.920 --> 19:21.083
that these ladies do not want you
around their husbands.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.249
I never saw it coming with my friends,
but not Melanie.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.249
You were always
inviting me out all the time.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.842
Sometimes, she even had to use brute
physical force to get me out of the house.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.611
- That I believe.
- Oh, she speaks.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.441
What should we talk about, Kate?
You know, so we're interesting to you.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.927
I mean, we've all shared.
What's your deal?

19:39.040 --> 19:42.010
- Melanie.
- God. That's a little harsh, don't you think?

19:42.120 --> 19:45.283
- I don't, actually.
- Emily, I can speak for myself.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.528
It's true. Don't wanna be here.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.450
What can I say? I'm mom'd out.

19:50.560 --> 19:54.042
First there were the moms
from when Lucas started school,

19:54.160 --> 19:57.562
and then the Sam moms, more play dates,
more school meetings,

19:57.680 --> 19:59.967
the juicing, the coffees.
I'm over it.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.376
I don't wanna know what birthday parties
are being planned.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.846
I don't give a fuck
about the best Mommy and Me yoga

20:04.960 --> 20:06.803
or Mommy and Me anything.

20:06.920 --> 20:10.288
And I especially don't wanna hear
that super-cute thing their kid said, did,

20:10.400 --> 20:13.927
wrote, or fucking sang,
I mean, come on, you want me to go on?

20:14.040 --> 20:16.088
- No, that's okay.
I think we got the idea.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.726
But just for the record,
Melanie and I do not juice.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.968
- I knew you were a bitch. I knew it.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.402
- Melanie, I'm sorry,
I know you don't like me

20:24.520 --> 20:27.171
because I'm not engaged and involved in...

20:27.280 --> 20:30.648
- No, no, no, no, no, no. My problem
with you isn't that you don't do shit

20:30.760 --> 20:32.444
while the rest of us do the shit.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.449
My problem with you
is that you walk around

20:34.560 --> 20:36.801
like you're too good
to do any shit at all.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.806
- You took my phone yesterday, for
fucksake! And my car wasn't even moving!

20:40.920 --> 20:43.924
Jesus,
just admit you take stuff a little too far.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.362
- When you admit you were texting and driving.
- I was buying milk!

20:47.480 --> 20:50.131
A mother can never run out of milk!

20:54.880 --> 20:56.041
- Come on.
- You know what?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.686
This is bullshit, I'm done here.
Let's get the cheque.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.167
- No, Melanie, come on.
No, no, no, don't go.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.563
I love that you're a traffic-safety person.
- Thank you.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.331
- Come on,
you don't wanna miss the tartufo.

21:07.440 --> 21:12.162
- You're right. I'm not leaving.
I want my tartufo. And I want a scotch.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.966
Because then you got your something sweet
and you got something to cut the sweet.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.082
She should leave.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.009
- Oh, with pleasure.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.690
- Oh, uh...

21:21.840 --> 21:24.161
she drove.
- No.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.331
- Mel, this is not good. Come on,

21:26.440 --> 21:28.488
we all have to see one another
at school tomorrow

21:28.640 --> 21:31.041
and for the whole rest of the year.
Don't do this.

21:31.160 --> 21:36.041
- Fine, but I cannot believe
I'm missing Forensic Files for this shit.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.322
You know, order me a scotch.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.970
Three fingers, one cube.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.410
- Don't... even think about trying
to convince me to come back in.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.443
- Don't worry.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.645
I'm just gonna wait here a minute
and then tell them I couldn't find you.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.124
What the hell is that?

22:02.240 --> 22:05.210
- Something you could desperately use.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.369
Here, peace pipe.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.805
- So basically you just need
to choose the picture you want...

22:18.920 --> 22:21.890
- Oh, my God. Jamie,
you matched with someone!

22:22.000 --> 22:23.650
- I did?
- That's so exciting.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.684
- Yikes. I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.689
Ah, dating at my age?

22:28.800 --> 22:31.770
Why do all the men
look like weary grandpas?

22:31.880 --> 22:35.282
- No, no, no, no, come on.
It's fun to look.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.482
Let's start with looking.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.523
He's cute.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.010
- I used to smoke the doobage
from time to time.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.241
Yeah, all right, I'll toke up.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.563
But you're still a massive cunt.
You know that, right?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.073
I'm guessing you haven't
done this in a while.

22:57.098 --> 22:58.908
Yeah, it's been like 15 years.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.924
- Here's how it works in the 21st century.
See this?

23:02.040 --> 23:04.281
- Yeah.
- You push it down.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.920
- Okay. Okay.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.927
Okay, now we're cooking with gas.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.162
(coughing)
(sniffling)

23:17.280 --> 23:19.521
(coughing)
That's a friend I remember.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.324
(laughing)

23:21.440 --> 23:26.526
Wow. Maybe there's more to you
than being just a big asshole.

23:26.640 --> 23:30.008
- Wait, I'm confused.
Am I an asshole or a cunt?

23:30.120 --> 23:33.124
Because there is a big difference
between the two.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.526
- True.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.729
Although sometimes in the dark
my husband can't tell.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.284
(laughter)

23:41.440 --> 23:44.887
- Have you heard anything about a...
fight club on the Helping Hand yard?

23:45.000 --> 23:48.004
- Huh? No. I never heard about that.
- You know, never mind.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.645
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.127
- What'd we miss?
- Good evening.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.203
- Good evening.
(gasping)

23:54.320 --> 23:55.970
- Oh, we're gonna need a bigger boat.

23:56.120 --> 23:59.886
- Yeah, I think we need one more of, uh...

24:00.040 --> 24:01.565
everything.
- Everyone.

24:01.680 --> 24:05.002
- Everything.
- Thank you. This one's mine.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.531
- I'm so glad we're doing this.

24:06.640 --> 24:10.326
Emily acted like it was gonna be so hard
to bring the kids over here.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.125
- Yeah, man, totally.
Kate gets like that too sometimes,

24:13.240 --> 24:16.289
like super wound up about stuff.
Just pay no mind.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.767
- Yeah.
(baby crying)

24:18.880 --> 24:21.281
Oh, what's going on, buddy?

24:23.280 --> 24:24.850
Oh, okay.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.485
(baby wailing)

24:26.600 --> 24:29.126
All right.
- He wants his blankie.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.402
- Blankie?
(wailing)

24:31.520 --> 24:33.807
His blankie?

24:33.920 --> 24:35.968
His blankie.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.128
Oh, fuck.
(baby wailing)

24:40.400 --> 24:43.165
- Marijuana makes me really paranoid,
but I'll take a little puff.

24:43.280 --> 24:46.523
(Melanie): Yeah, Jamie.
(laughing)

24:46.640 --> 24:50.804
- Pass that. There's something so classic
about a perfectly rolled joint.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.082
- Mm, yeah.
- I like to go old school sometimes,

24:53.200 --> 24:55.771
with a classic Brazilian bikini wax.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.090
- Brazilian's retro now?
- Oh, not even. They're like totally out.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.770
- What?
- You think that's crazy?

25:01.880 --> 25:04.486
Check out this. Look at this.
- I'm hungry.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.250
- This is crazy. Vajazzling.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.169
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.648
- Very popular now.
- Wait. She shaves off all the hair

25:11.760 --> 25:15.765
on her vagina God's given her
and takes a handful of crystals

25:15.880 --> 25:19.327
and some Elmer's Glue
and sprinkles up a little design?

25:19.440 --> 25:20.930
Is that what she does?

25:21.080 --> 25:23.321
What kind of woman wants sand
on her vagina...

25:23.440 --> 25:25.488
(girl): What are you doing in there?
(exclamations)

25:25.600 --> 25:28.604
I see a lot of feet.
- I got it.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.207
Hi. How are you?

25:33.320 --> 25:35.209
What a cute little outfit.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.890
Is it your birthday?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.571
- Are you smoking in here?
- Of course we're not smoking.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.769
- You know what? I think the manager
would like to know what's going on.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.325
- Hey, wait a minute.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.841
I have an idea.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.362
How about we send an ice-cream sundae
over to your table?

25:50.480 --> 25:53.484
You know, like a little surprise
for keeping a secret?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.327
- I want a steak.
- Damn.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.807
- New York Strip, medium rare.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.445
And a coke.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.164
- Fine.
- Fine.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.007
Great talking to you.

26:10.360 --> 26:14.285
- That little girl is fucking intense!

26:14.400 --> 26:17.961
If that's what I'm missing out on,
then, no, thank you.

26:18.080 --> 26:21.050
(smoke alarm beeping)
- Oh, no. Did we do that?

26:21.160 --> 26:23.083
- Oh, shoot!
- Oh, my God!

26:23.200 --> 26:26.283
(patrons exclaiming)

26:26.400 --> 26:28.084
- Okay! Oh, my God!

26:28.200 --> 26:29.850
(laughing)

26:29.960 --> 26:32.645
- Let's go through the back.
We don't wanna get caught in here!

26:34.160 --> 26:35.969
(laughter)

26:37.960 --> 26:39.883
- Oh, my God!

26:40.000 --> 26:43.766
- Do you hear that? Are those sirens?
(sirens wailing)

26:43.880 --> 26:47.123
- Ladies, I believe
this is a dine-and-dash situation.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.571
Let's move out!

26:48.680 --> 26:51.490
If we're staying out later,
I gotta text my hubby.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.047
- Oh, good idea. And I'll text Andrew
and he can tell Tom.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.041
- Okay-

Come here. Ladies, quick question.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.851
Do you mind if we make a quick pit stop?
I love me some Walgreens.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.145
You're gonna love it,
too, because guess what.

27:34.170 --> 27:35.995
Boom, I got a
motherfucking gift card!

27:36.080 --> 27:39.243
- Hey, bud, see?
This is the same colour as your blankie.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.761
Maybe that works. What do you think?
(wailing)

27:41.880 --> 27:45.123
Nope. Okay. I think we have to go, man.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.846
- Daddy, you promised I could watch it.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.530
Please, please, please!

27:49.640 --> 27:52.689
- I know, honey. I'm sorry.
- You know what, man? I got an idea.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.041
(baby crying)
Hey, come with me.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.449
This way, please.

27:59.560 --> 28:03.565
- Where are we going?
- Step right up", to the magic swing set.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.569
Right in here, my man.
(wailing)

28:05.680 --> 28:09.241
- It's all right, buddy.
- Bring him on in. May I?

28:09.360 --> 28:11.408
- Sure. What are you doing?
(baby screaming)

28:11.520 --> 28:14.000
- Don't question me. I got four of these.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.361
That's what I thought.
- I have two.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.165
- I got myself involved in the swing set.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.250
Can I have that, please? Thank you.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.330
I know.
Can I just give you one tip?

28:25.440 --> 28:28.842
You might wanna get yourself
like a soft, fuzzy blanket,

28:28.960 --> 28:30.689
instead of this piece-of-shit towel.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.883
- Yeah, I forgot the blanket.
And that's your towel, by the way.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.050
- Oh. Well, then we have disgusting towels.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.528
All right, watch and learn.
(wailing)

28:41.640 --> 28:43.483
Watch.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.284
(crying)

28:45.400 --> 28:47.164
- What?

28:53.880 --> 28:56.690
Whoa. Whoa.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.607
(whispering): That is fucking incredible.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.762

- Oh, hey, here's our car. I sprang for an
SUV, 'cause I'm a bad-ass bitch like that.

29:32.760 --> 29:35.240
- Yeah!
- You got us a car? Why?

29:35.360 --> 29:37.647
- Uh, to get around?
- No, no, it's good, all right?

29:37.760 --> 29:39.765
We're gonna leave the
crime scene to cool out.

29:39.790 --> 29:41.709
We're gonna leave the
cars there to deflect.

29:41.840 --> 29:45.162
And that's our little Katie right there,
'cause, whoo, yeah, you got our six!

29:45.280 --> 29:47.896
- I don't even know what you're
talking about! What the fuck's a six?

29:47.920 --> 29:50.400
- Oh, come on, that's military jargon, right?
- Okay.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.763
- Yeah, six is back.
Katie, you got our six, girl.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.531
- Roger that, you crazy cunt.
- Yeah, I'm a crazy cunt.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.051
(laughter)
- Wow.

29:58.160 --> 30:01.482
- Guys, I got a bad feeling
about getting in these things.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.604
You hear about these guys,
they ride around all day,

30:04.720 --> 30:08.486
and they pick up the last ride
and just snap like crazy.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.682
- They do not.
- It happens all the time.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.325
- Stop-

30:12.440 --> 30:16.286
- Man, Jamie, you weren't messing around
when you said you get paranoid.

30:16.400 --> 30:21.531
- I know. And the problem is,
I always had Theo with me when I got high.

30:21.640 --> 30:25.486
He took care of me when I started
to get like this. He was like my person.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.409
- I'm gonna be your person.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.080
You don't have to worry.
I got you, girl.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.089
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.362
- That was a fun night, you guys.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.330
- Em, there's no fucking way
I'm doing bedtime tonight.

30:38.480 --> 30:42.644
- I mean, if I am staying out with you
gals, I need to get more supplies.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.650
- Ooh, I better stay out here.
I'm done with that stuff.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.683
- No, we're sticking together.
Like sister-wives.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.689
Come on, don't worry about it.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.247
It's like Crabtree & Evelyn, but with weed.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.771
- All right.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.564
(bell jingling)

30:57.680 --> 30:59.409
- For fucksake, Wayne,
you know who I am.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.000
Now please, just play nice.
I have brought friends with me.

31:02.120 --> 31:05.488
- Oh, very nice.
Ladies, my name is Wayne.

31:05.600 --> 31:09.047
I am your marijuana sommelier
for the evening.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.606
Oh, and here's Brady.
- My ears are burning.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.603
- He's my partner.
- Hey, Kate!

31:13.720 --> 31:16.166
- Brady! How are you?
- Thanks for coming in.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.725
Hi, guys-
- Hey.

31:17.840 --> 31:21.287
- Hey, look, anything you want, we've got
it. If we don't have it, we'll grow it.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.445
If we can't grow it, we're gonna get it
from some factory in some Godforsaken land.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.085
- You know what, you know what?

31:27.200 --> 31:32.206
I think we should set them up with our
selection of stuff that's for mothers,

31:32.320 --> 31:33.924
'cause, you know, we love the mothers.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.530
- We love our mothers.
- Pfft.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.130
- Sounds good.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.402
(East Indian music)

31:39.520 --> 31:41.522
- Let's begin with this one.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.246
I think you might enjoy.
It's Ruth Bader Ganja.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.966
- You guys fans of Supreme Court justices?
- Oh, yeah.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.526
- Well, you might've heard
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.211
It's now Ruth Bader Ganja.
- Ruth Bader Ganja.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.400
We were playing around
with John Stevens for a while,

31:54.440 --> 31:56.400
but we couldn't really think
of anything for that.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.647
- But for you I think it's very good,

31:58.760 --> 32:02.082
because it will get you...
(both): supremely high.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.249
- But at the same time, you'll still
be able to mediate family disputes,

32:05.400 --> 32:08.131
or decide on what you
might be cooking or...

32:08.240 --> 32:11.449
- It's also a really fun weed
when you need to concentrate.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.847
You can build a castle out of Legos.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.281
You can play
with Calico Critters all night.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.323
- Shopkins, and you have
total concentration.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.437
- We put just a pinch
of Adderall in there,

32:20.462 --> 32:22.594
which gives you just that
extra dash of focus.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.490
- What?
- Yeah. It'd be cool if you didn't say anything,

32:25.600 --> 32:27.887
just because it's, you
know, it's very illegal.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.367
- But maybe can we talk about edibles?
- Oh.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.882
- Oh, absolutely. Which, by the way,
reminds me, do any of you have glaucoma?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.446
If so, we are giving away
some free gummy worms.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.130
- I have glaucoma.
- Oh, excellent!

32:38.240 --> 32:40.891
- You have glaucoma?
- Oh, you're gonna love these...

32:41.000 --> 32:44.083
- You do not have glaucoma!
- Oh, wait, you're kidding.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.010
You don't have glaucoma.
No, I get it.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.645
You guys are so our speed.
- Yeah.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.127
- 'Cause you play around,
you can joke, you have a good...

32:51.280 --> 32:54.090
- We do the same thing.
We joke around each other even at home.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.368
- It's so crazy.
People don't even get our humour.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.136
- And the wives are,
like: "What the fuck...

32:58.160 --> 32:59.776
- you guys talking about?"
- That's why we...

32:59.800 --> 33:02.120
- Don't hang out with them much,
but these are really good.

33:02.160 --> 33:06.051
These are called Good Night Moons. You
know the children's book, Good Night Moon?

33:06.160 --> 33:08.640
- Of course.
- Obviously. And then what mother doesn't?

33:08.760 --> 33:10.683
- And we went ahead and added the S.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.330
You know, Good Night Moons.
- Moons.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.602
- This is delicious.
- Wayne.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.888
Somebody's discovered our balls.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.651
We make those here.
- Oh, I like it.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.888
- It will fuck you up. It's really intense.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.656
- You know how you have
that concentrated detergent.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.570
"This one little thimbleful
for the whole washer?"

33:26.680 --> 33:28.682
But, yeah,
because it's that concentrated.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.327
- How much of your own products
do you get your little paws into?

33:32.440 --> 33:34.568
- Oh, we don't smoke.
- I don't do it.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.091
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.050
- My only addiction is Mad Men.
Oh, forget it.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.441
- He loves it.
- Every week. Forget it.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.370
- Tom. Tom, you got to see this.

33:46.480 --> 33:49.006
Kate's partying with the school moms.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.685
It's on the bubble-bath chick's Instagram.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.491
- You know, it really is embarrassing
that you follow her.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.968
- Yeah. I know. And it's embarrassing
that she doesn't follow me back.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.902
Okay, I gave Amelia a
five-minute warning.

34:00.927 --> 34:02.790
Oh, oh, grab that
door, grab that door!

34:02.880 --> 34:04.928
- What?
- Ah!

34:05.040 --> 34:07.168
(jiggling handle)

34:07.280 --> 34:10.523
Uh... it locks when it's not supposed to.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.484
That's my fault. I should've told you.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.728
We are momentarily locked out.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.002
- What do you mean,
momentarily locked out?

34:18.120 --> 34:20.964
- What I said: Momentarily.
We keep a spare down here

34:21.120 --> 34:23.440
in one of those fake-dog-poop things.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.324
Why don't we just do this?

34:25.440 --> 34:28.045
Why don't we just let them
finish their movie in there,

34:28.159 --> 34:30.288
and me and you
will chill out here with Wyatt?

34:30.400 --> 34:33.847
- Oh, yeah, well, actually, I was hoping
to get the kids home before Emily got back.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.610
- Oh, well, Kate texted and said
they were gonna stay out later.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.409
- What?
- Oh.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.204
I think I'm supposed to tell you that.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.884
(sighing)
- Okay. Yeah, sure.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.331
- Mm...

34:46.440 --> 34:49.045
I haven't licked a ball in a decade.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.474
It got you your divorce.

34:50.498 --> 34:53.234
Do not tell me you still
blow your husbands.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.364
- I never blew Theo. I mean,
maybe for like a minute on his birthday.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.767
- And divorce.
- Sometimes it's just easier, you know,

34:58.880 --> 35:01.770
like a quick one during
a commercial break of Kimmel.

35:01.880 --> 35:05.771
Andrew's psyched and I don't have
to have him lying all over me.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.370
(laughter)
- I hear that, sister.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.608
My preference is Antiques Roadshow.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.963
There's no commercials,
but I just pop down there.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.969
(sucking)
Me blowing those nuts.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.651
I'm back in time
for the Ming Dynasty office.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.246
- Oh, Lord, well,
just imagine having to be single again.

35:20.360 --> 35:24.649
It's all back on the table for me now.
What if I have to do anal again?

35:24.760 --> 35:26.125
- Again?
- Look at it this way.

35:26.240 --> 35:30.131
Maybe you'll meet the guy
that makes you wanna do anal... again.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.084
- Thank God I never did.
- Emily's one of those rare angels

35:33.200 --> 35:35.806
who actually married
the first guy she had sex with.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.400
- What?! No fucking way!
- No, I didn't. Come on.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.921
- Don't hit me! It's true!
- No, I was young.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.850
- You guys, I think we're being followed.
We're being followed.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.962
Do you hear the footsteps?
- Yeah, ours.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.487
- I think you've had one too many licks.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.444
How about we get a drink over there,
cool out for a bit?

35:51.560 --> 35:53.562
- Okay, let's do that.
- Oh, we got a runner!

35:53.680 --> 35:55.284
- Shit.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.921
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.371
Excuse me.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.010
Oh, wow.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.761
You have beautiful,
beautiful bone structure.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.210
- Thank you.
How about a Coke?

36:15.320 --> 36:18.688
- Oh, no. Actually, I was gonna get a
vodka-and-tonic, because it's transparent.

36:18.800 --> 36:23.249
That way if some weirdo tries to slip something
in it, I can see it to protect myself.

36:23.360 --> 36:27.729
- Okay, how about a Sprite?
Also transparent. See? Look at that.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.650
- I'd love a Glenlivit, one cube. Thank you.
- Glenlivit, one cube.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.649
- And can we grab two house whites?

36:32.760 --> 36:35.650
- House whites, all right.
Here you go. All right.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.489
Let me guess...

36:37.600 --> 36:39.443
Mom's night out?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.289
- Again?
- Oh, come on.

36:41.400 --> 36:46.008
- Should we be offended you would
immediately assume that we're all moms?

36:46.120 --> 36:48.168
- No. You should be flattered.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.247
- It says MOMS.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.089
- Yeah, I got two of them.
- Oh.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.204
- Good eye, by the way.
Usually people don't notice that.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.365
- I got a thing for details.
It's like a bad lawyer habit.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.767
I'm Emily.
- Luke.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.644
- Luke as in...

37:08.760 --> 37:10.842
this your place, Luke?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.689
- That's me.
- Cool.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.848
(man): A little help over here?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.445
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Okay.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.927
- What's gotten to you, Em?
- Wine.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.963
- Weed.
(laughter)

37:21.080 --> 37:23.287
I am so sorry
that I tricked you into tonight.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.768
- Ah, you know what? I hate to admit it,
but I'm having a great time.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.405
- It's kind of a perfect night, right?

37:28.520 --> 37:30.522
- You know what would make it
even more perfect,

37:30.680 --> 37:33.126
would be if Jake Ryan
just like wandered in here.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.971
- Oh, God, Jake Ryan.
- Oh!

37:36.080 --> 37:38.082
I love that guy!

37:38.200 --> 37:40.282
Sixteen Candles.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.408
- For me that was all about
Anthony Michael Hall.

37:42.520 --> 37:43.965
- What?
- Farmer Ted. Ugh!

37:44.080 --> 37:46.731
- What?
- Yeah, I love his little fuss.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.047
- You do not!
- I do! I can't help myself.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.965
- Oh, my God!
- Put him right in there, bounce him around.

37:52.120 --> 37:55.806
- No, I have to say, for me,
Jake Ryan, he was my ideal.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.724
He ruined romance for me. Honestly.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.525
- It's true, because no guy
could ever live up to him.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.642
No guy ever will live up to him.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.370
- Well, he's a character in a movie.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.450
- I always liked Some Kind of Wonderful.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.927
- Some Kind of Wonderful. Yes.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.724
Eric Stoltz, Lea Thompson...

38:11.840 --> 38:14.411
- No, Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.450
- Yes! God, I can't believe
I forgot that! Yes!

38:17.560 --> 38:20.211
God, Mary Stuart
had that killer little haircut.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.563
- Super cute.
- She was so cool. I just wanted to be her.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.922
(woman): Excuse me?
Can I get a drink, please?

38:29.040 --> 38:30.963
- Check you out.
- Don't judge.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.531
- Oh, lam not.

38:32.640 --> 38:36.247
I mean, a little bit of male attention
might be just what you need tonight.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.001
- How do you feel
about two delicious ice-cold beverages?

38:41.120 --> 38:43.487
- Yeah, all right.
- I brewed that myself.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.170
In the shed.

38:45.280 --> 38:49.171
Let me know if you get
just a hint of bacon in there.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.362
- Whoa. That's, uh...
- Right?

38:51.480 --> 38:54.051
- That's a lot of bacon.
- Oh, a lot of bacon.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.162
- This is like a, um...

38:56.280 --> 39:00.444
some sort of like a bacon... juice thing?

39:01.520 --> 39:03.522
- That's beer. What do you mean?
- Beer?

39:03.640 --> 39:06.291
- Yes, you dick. I brewed this beer.
- It's gray.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.801
- Did you really not know
that this was beer?

39:08.920 --> 39:12.003
- Can you carbonate it?
Is that part of a different process?

39:12.160 --> 39:13.525
- This is all great feedback.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.881
- You want me to keep going?
- No, no, no.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.088
I think I got your gist of it.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.806
These girls are having a blast.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.644
- What... what is it?

39:24.960 --> 39:26.610
- They keep posting to Insta.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.883
- Well, Emily's certainly having a blast.
Who's that?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.128
- I think they're just
having some drinks, man.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.050
And if I know Kate,
she's super stoned by now.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.810
That guy looks like a bartender.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.570
They're having fun.

39:41.960 --> 39:45.567
- Fun. She has this whole thing
about fucking fun.

39:45.680 --> 39:49.765
We don't have... fun anymore,
like we never have fun.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.441
- What do you think?
You think you guys are fun?

39:53.560 --> 39:56.962
- Well, I mean, you know,
I'm... pretty stressed out,

39:57.120 --> 39:59.088
you know... generally, I guess.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.249
- What?!
What are you talking about?

40:02.360 --> 40:05.091
Don't say that about yourself.
- All right.

40:05.200 --> 40:09.091
Well, look, I'm running, like,
11 different projects at work,

40:09.200 --> 40:12.727
and on the phone,
dealing with like building codes

40:12.840 --> 40:16.481
and contractors and asshole clients
in like five states.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.443
- That fucking blows.
- Yeah.

40:19.600 --> 40:24.686
So, you know, when I get home,
I... don't wanna deal with anyone.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.883
- Right.
- And honestly, neither does she.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.002
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

40:31.680 --> 40:35.287
It's not the high point of
our relationship. Yeah.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.724
Look, man, I think that you guys
need to cut yourself a break

40:39.840 --> 40:43.970
while you're still in the trenches
and the kids are so young.

40:44.080 --> 40:47.243
You know, try to just laugh
at some of the bullshit

40:47.360 --> 40:50.648
and not be angry at each other,
like, all the time.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.484
- So, like, lower the bar?

40:52.600 --> 40:54.364
- Yeah. Like...

40:56.040 --> 40:58.088
(Tom chuckling)
just a bit.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.522
- You're really lowering the bar.
- Just keep it realistic.

41:02.640 --> 41:05.928
- You can dig a hole and put the bar in it.
- Not that... Yeah, not that low.

41:06.040 --> 41:09.487
- I need a lot of room, though,
because I tend to do this a lot.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.170
- That's good.
- I just keep doing it,

41:11.320 --> 41:13.448
and doing it and doing it.
- Just don't... Okay.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.642
- That's a gorgeous beer.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.367
<i>- Oh...
♪ Now the reason we're here ♪</i>

41:23.480 --> 41:26.211
<i>♪ As man and woman ♪</i>

41:26.320 --> 41:28.209
- You are so resourceful.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.651
- Mm...

41:29.760 --> 41:31.649
- I mean, our philosophy is,

41:31.800 --> 41:35.327
if we can stay
pretty much into each other,

41:35.440 --> 41:37.886
three or four months out of the year

41:38.000 --> 41:40.321
while keeping our kids alive,

41:40.440 --> 41:43.250
teaching them
to be semi-decent human beings...

41:43.360 --> 41:45.567
- Right.
- We're golden.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.284
- Huh.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.411
Now, those three or four months,
are they, like,

41:51.520 --> 41:53.966
spread throughout the year,
or are those consecutive?

41:54.080 --> 41:56.048
- Spread throughout the year.
- Okay.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.885
- I'm getting so many likes
from my rose-budding post.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.765
A lot of new friend requests, too,

42:01.880 --> 42:03.928
but weird ones like Hard4Buttz.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.606
ButtKing343,

42:06.720 --> 42:08.449
AssMeAnything.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.881
- Okay, Jamie, let me see this post.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.800
Okay. Do you know what rose-budding is?

42:14.920 --> 42:18.367
- When you throw the roses...
- Not exactly.

42:18.480 --> 42:21.816
I think you should take this post down and
don't accept any of these friend requests,

42:21.840 --> 42:23.376
because these people are not your friends.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.802
- I'm so tired all the time. We both are.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.241
It sounds like a joke, but it's not.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.722
I literally can fall asleep
while I'm pooping on the toilet.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.604
- Okay, well, this isn't a joke.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.041
I would like you to teach me
how to do that.

42:37.160 --> 42:41.245
- Okay. Well, this is gonna sound weird.
I would love to.

42:41.360 --> 42:43.601
(chiming)
- Oh, wait, wait.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.007
It's my mother-in-law.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.856
- Please don't answer
and kill this sweet buzz.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.042
- Never.
- This is so fun.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.969
- Oh, fuck, trust me.

42:52.080 --> 42:55.971
- I love Halloween candy.
- Yeah, and you guys stock up early, huh?

42:57.800 --> 42:59.848
- Actually...

42:59.960 --> 43:03.123
these are the kids' from last year.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.960
- One time, Theo, his mom and I
were sitting on the couch watching a movie.

43:10.040 --> 43:12.520
I was massaging Theo's
back and his shoulders,

43:12.640 --> 43:15.564
and all of a sudden I feel something.

43:15.680 --> 43:19.321
It was his mom's hand.
She was rubbing his back, too.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.489
We were both massaging him
at the same time.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.489
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.329
- So awkward!
- Fucking sick!

43:26.440 --> 43:29.444
What is it with mothers and their sons?!

43:29.560 --> 43:31.244
- Check this out.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.089
You see this?

43:33.200 --> 43:36.283
I got this last Thanksgiving
fighting with my mother-in-law

43:36.400 --> 43:38.687
over who was gonna make
the cranberry sauce.

43:38.840 --> 43:43.084
That woman has got
lifeless eyes, black eyes,

43:43.200 --> 43:46.488
American Girl Doll
Jess McConnell eyes.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.610
- Oh!
- Jersey Shore, 2002.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.688
- Yeah?
- Andrew's mom stepped on me

43:51.800 --> 43:53.723
with her old-lady jelly mules

43:53.840 --> 43:57.162
trying to be the first
to lay out his fucking beach towel.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.896
- Okay, ladies, here's what I figured out.
You're not gonna like this shit.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.491
But we are all gonna end up
just like our mothers-in-laws.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.489
- No fucking way.
- Mm-hmm.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.730
Fucking way, fucking way. I'm telling you,
I'm gonna be all over my William.

44:08.840 --> 44:12.481
I can already tell. I can!
I love that kid so much!

44:12.600 --> 44:15.080
Fuck his wife. I raised him,
I earned that shit.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.964
- Yeah, well, try having four.
- Believe me.

44:17.080 --> 44:20.971
- As far as I'm concerned, they can move in
with their future wives anytime now.

44:21.080 --> 44:25.005
- Oh, you think so? You say that now,
but I'm gonna tell you, mark my words,

44:25.120 --> 44:27.646
we are all gonna be inappropriately
massaging our grown sons.

44:27.760 --> 44:30.570
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
- What?

44:30.680 --> 44:32.523
Show me.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.290
- Oh, God!!

44:34.440 --> 44:36.886
- Jamie just looked up rose-budding.
- Delete.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.571
- That is fucking disgusting!
- It's an anus.

44:39.680 --> 44:41.842
- Okay, Tom.
(sniffing)

44:41.960 --> 44:44.440
I think I'm ready
to share something with you

44:44.560 --> 44:46.801
that might just help
with that Emily situation.

44:47.680 --> 44:51.162
It's a little trick that I call
"Two Cs a Day."

44:51.280 --> 44:53.362
Have you heard of that?

44:53.480 --> 44:54.970
- No. What?

44:55.080 --> 44:57.560
- Cs like compliments?

44:57.680 --> 45:00.160
- So you give Kate
two compliments every day?

45:00.280 --> 45:01.611
- That's right.

45:01.760 --> 45:06.641
So, for example, I'll do one C
like straight out of the gate.

45:06.760 --> 45:10.242
I'll do a C about usually
her physical appearance, you know.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.967
Like, what she's wearing or how she looks,
something like that.

45:14.080 --> 45:17.084
But you wanna try to use
the words "beautiful,"

45:17.200 --> 45:19.726
or "hot," or "sexy,"
something like that.

45:19.840 --> 45:23.003
Don't ever say "nice" or "pretty."
They don't like that.

45:23.120 --> 45:26.363
Then, later on in the day,
I try to follow up with another C,

45:26.480 --> 45:28.369
but this is more
of an appreciation C,

45:28.480 --> 45:32.929
like: "How am I so lucky
to be in this with you?"

45:33.080 --> 45:34.844
You know, but super sincere.
The thing is,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.367
I'm starting to feel
a little bit guilty about it,

45:37.480 --> 45:40.404
because I'm now getting
so much out of it.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.885
- Like blowjob?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.923
- Yeah, like blowjobs.
- Really?

45:44.040 --> 45:46.771
- Yeah, while I'm watching Kimmel.
- Whoa.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.684
Where did you get this idea?

45:49.800 --> 45:52.804
- We had a big fight and she was, like:

45:52.920 --> 45:55.685
"I don't feel like
you even appreciate me.

45:55.800 --> 45:59.441
Why don't you say one nice thing
to me every single day?"

45:59.560 --> 46:02.928
- Okay, all right.
So your big, like, genius plan

46:03.040 --> 46:06.522
is something that your wife
told you to do?

46:06.640 --> 46:10.565
- No, she said one a day,
I upped it to two.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.610
- All right. Come clean, newbie.

46:15.720 --> 46:17.802
- Whatever do you mean?

46:17.960 --> 46:21.760
- Wow, clearly you were an extra
on Cocktail, Tom Cruise.

46:21.920 --> 46:24.571
- Close. I tended bar, summer of '99,

46:24.680 --> 46:27.126
the Yacht Club on Lake Michigan.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.481
- Wow.
- Our signature drink:

46:29.640 --> 46:32.041
Summer on the Shore. For you.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.484
- That's a pretty good G&T.

46:38.600 --> 46:41.729
You make this for your husband
when he comes walking through the door?

46:41.840 --> 46:44.605
- Not lately.
(siren wailing)

46:44.720 --> 46:47.451
- Oh, excuse me.
- What? No, not again.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.562
God, I'm gonna kill them.

46:49.680 --> 46:51.358
- Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

46:51.383 --> 46:53.311
please direct your
attention to centre stage,

46:53.400 --> 46:56.882
because, yes, it is that
time: Karaoke Hour.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.850
(all): Karaoke Hour!
(cheering)

47:00.000 --> 47:01.650
(laughing)
- All right.

47:02.920 --> 47:06.527
- This one is for you... and your friends.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.529
Moms, you're on!

47:08.640 --> 47:10.688
- Oh, shit.
(funky music)

47:10.800 --> 47:12.768
(crowd cheering)
- Oh!

47:12.880 --> 47:14.291
- Fuck, yeah.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.004
- Come on, you nailed it.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.849
Let's go.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.241
Whoo!

47:23.400 --> 47:24.925
Remember this?
(laughter)

47:25.040 --> 47:26.724
Very well.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.968

- Dad! What are you doing out here?

48:26.280 --> 48:28.320
- Hey, honey...
- Can you guys grab the door closed?

48:28.360 --> 48:30.522
(door closing)
- Too late.

48:31.640 --> 48:32.971
- We're hungry.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.536
Hey, let me grab that
spare key real quick.

48:35.561 --> 48:37.792
All right. How was
the movie, guys?

48:37.880 --> 48:39.609
- It was awesome.
- It was okay.

48:39.720 --> 48:41.722
- Nope, this is not it. Dammit.
- What?

48:41.840 --> 48:44.047
- Fuck. That's real poop.
That's not fake.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.811
- So what are you saying,
that we're locked out?

48:46.920 --> 48:48.570
- Yeah, Tom, we're locked out,

48:48.680 --> 48:51.650
but what's more important
is we don't own a dog!

48:51.760 --> 48:53.762
- Okay.
- Sam, did you do this?

48:53.880 --> 48:55.609
Gross.
- Okay.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.165
- Right? Come on!
- Yeah.

48:57.280 --> 49:00.124
- Where's a fake piece of poop
when you need it?

49:00.240 --> 49:01.810
- Dude, this is not good.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.491
So you're saying
that we're actually locked out,

49:04.600 --> 49:06.045
like for sure?

49:06.160 --> 49:08.686
- Tom, calm down.
It's gonna be fine, all right?

49:08.840 --> 49:11.207
I'm pretty good in a crisis.
Watch this.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.367
Guys! Guys!!!

49:15.480 --> 49:18.051
Oh, no!!
Oh, no, we're locked out!!

49:18.160 --> 49:21.130
We're locked out!!
What are we gonna do?!

49:21.240 --> 49:24.050
Well, your dad and I
are gonna protect you, okay?!

49:24.160 --> 49:25.924
So don't worry, don't worry!

49:26.040 --> 49:29.761
The bad news is,
we're locked out until Mom gets home!

49:29.880 --> 49:31.962
Oh! But the good news is...

49:33.160 --> 49:35.049
we got candy.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.328
(kids): Yay!!
- Lots of candy!

49:37.440 --> 49:39.807
(wailing)

49:40.800 --> 49:44.009
- Okay, guys, this is my second move.
It's called the "Oh, no, Romeo."

49:44.120 --> 49:46.691
I'm out on the dance floor.
I'm grinding with my girls.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.484
I'm doing my thing. I look good.

49:48.600 --> 49:51.683
He comes up behind me,
he wraps his arm around me.

49:51.840 --> 49:55.526
I say, "Oh, no, Romeo!
Stop, elbow, go!"

49:55.640 --> 49:57.881
- Oh, no, Romeo!
(grunting)

49:58.000 --> 50:01.209
Pow!
(exclamations)

50:01.320 --> 50:04.290
(groaning)
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.289
- Oh! Hey.

50:06.440 --> 50:07.885
All right.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.525
I'm good.
- Are you okay?

50:09.640 --> 50:11.369
- I'm good. This...
- I'm sorry about that.

50:11.480 --> 50:13.721
- Oh, you don't have nothing
to be sorry about.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.524
That felt good in a way.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.881
- That's the "Oh, no, Romeo." Yeah.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.844
- So where are you taking me?
- Truth?

50:21.960 --> 50:24.406
- Please.
- Good to get outside sometimes.

50:24.520 --> 50:29.128
Get away from the bar,
get some fresh air. You know...

50:29.240 --> 50:31.527
- It's really a nice night.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.722
Good breeze.

50:33.880 --> 50:35.769
(chuckling)
- You're very cute,

50:35.880 --> 50:38.121
you're very funny,
and you're very smart.

50:38.240 --> 50:41.084
And I'll have you know,
I take my breaks very seriously.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.044
But I had a feeling about you
and I'm just happy

50:44.160 --> 50:46.049
that you came out with me tonight.

50:47.880 --> 50:50.121
And I apologize in advance for this.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.403
This is a disgusting, terrible habit.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.966
Don't judge me.
- Oh, God, are you kidding me?

50:56.080 --> 50:58.321
No. Before kids,

50:58.440 --> 51:01.569
a cigarette and a glass of wine at night
was, like...

51:01.680 --> 51:04.524
- Look, we can relive
your old glory days right now.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.564
Nobody's watching.
We're out here by ourselves. I won't tell.

51:07.680 --> 51:09.569
- Oh, God.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.284
I shouldn't.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.136
It's been years.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

51:13.160 --> 51:17.210
It's not a great look to be smoking a cigarette
and pushing a stroller down the street.

51:17.320 --> 51:20.802
Although it's kind of sexy
in like a fucked-up '70s kind of way.

51:20.920 --> 51:23.161
- You're funny.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.124
- Ooh, you don't have a lighter
by chance, do you?

51:26.240 --> 51:28.811
- Do I have a lighter?
- Oh, you know what?

51:28.920 --> 51:31.161
That's a dumb question.
Of course you don't.

51:31.280 --> 51:34.045
- So... what about you?
You ever have any kids?

51:34.160 --> 51:35.969
Ever been married?

51:36.080 --> 51:37.605
- Nah.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.803
I came close... to both,

51:40.920 --> 51:43.810
but I just think the lifestyle
I was leading in the bar,

51:43.920 --> 51:45.922
and, you know,
all the things going on,

51:46.080 --> 51:48.924
it was just never very
conducive to any of that.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.606
But enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

51:51.720 --> 51:56.408
Emily, the bartending lawyer,
who's been married for how many years?

51:56.520 --> 51:58.409
(sighing)
- Truth?

51:58.520 --> 52:00.010
- Truth.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.771
- I have been with my
husband since college.

52:03.760 --> 52:06.001
It's boring and predictable, right?

52:06.120 --> 52:07.849
- Uh, no.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.008
If boring and predictable is your thing,

52:10.120 --> 52:12.009
then you're... killing it.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.929
(Emily laughing)

52:14.040 --> 52:17.089
See, it's not so bad.
You get to spend some quality time

52:17.200 --> 52:20.010
with a nightlife entrepreneur,
who's actually kind of a great guy.

52:20.120 --> 52:23.522
- I get it. Your name's on your napkins.
- Ls that a fresh tone?

52:23.640 --> 52:25.642
This is me. I'm gonna get a lighter.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.250
- Oh.
- I'll be back.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.160
- Get out, get out, get out, get out.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.764
Ooh.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.845
- This is pretty weird
that we're all laying in the car together.

52:41.960 --> 52:44.964
- Yeah. But it's kind of fun too, right?

52:45.080 --> 52:47.447
- It's... unexpected.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.443
(Tom guffawing)

52:49.600 --> 52:52.206
- Where did you learn that word?

52:52.320 --> 52:57.247
- From Mommy. It's the word of the day.
- Oh, Mommy has a word of the day, huh?

52:58.400 --> 53:02.166
- Daddy, I'm cold,
and it smells like Wyatt's poop in here.

53:02.320 --> 53:04.687
(clicking tongue)
- Oh, wow.

53:04.800 --> 53:07.201
Is that what that terrible smell is?

53:07.320 --> 53:10.290
No, I thought it was Andrew.
(Amelia giggling)

53:10.400 --> 53:12.209
- You're funny.
- Am I?

53:16.000 --> 53:17.604
Hey, hon.

53:19.200 --> 53:20.929
I'm sorry.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.884
You know, it's my fault
that we are stuck out here,

53:24.000 --> 53:28.210
and I know this is not the kind of thing
that would happen on Mommy's watch.

53:29.200 --> 53:32.044
She's pretty good at this stuff, huh?

53:33.040 --> 53:38.524
- I like it when you're the mommy too
sometimes, Daddy.

He was here with my friend all night.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.122
Where'd they go?
- They left like 20 minutes ago.

55:02.240 --> 55:06.802
I mean, he said he'd be back, though. But
he did check to make sure I was closing up.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.445
So they're probably...

55:08.560 --> 55:11.404
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
This does not, not seem like her.

55:11.520 --> 55:13.966
She would tell me if she was leaving.
Where'd they go?

55:14.120 --> 55:16.282
- He didn't say.
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna text her.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.050
- I feel like something's wrong.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.456
- You felt like something's wrong
all night. It's gonna be okay.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.051
- She's not responding.
I feel like something's wrong too now.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.650
- What's your name?
- Alfred.

55:24.760 --> 55:27.240
- I'm Melanie. I'd like you to tell me
about your friend, Luke.

55:27.320 --> 55:30.085
Is this a regular thing he does,
leaving the bar with a lady friend?

55:30.200 --> 55:33.010
- He's done it a few times before.
- Great. You're doing a great job.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.576
Cooperation's really key here.
- Thank you.

55:34.600 --> 55:37.206
- I'd like you to go in your purse,
grab your phone, call Luke,

55:37.320 --> 55:39.687
have him bring Emily back right now.
Can you do that?

55:39.800 --> 55:40.800
- I can't.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.609
- You can't?
- He's scary. I can't.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.165
- You don't know me, do you?
- No.

55:44.280 --> 55:45.640
- Jamie here knows me.
- Hi, Jamie.

55:45.720 --> 55:48.166
- Jamie, tell Al what I'm like when I'm mad.
- Call your boss.

55:48.320 --> 55:51.160
- I think you'd like to call your boss,
okay? Because you can cooperate,

55:51.200 --> 55:55.444
or I can have the ATF here in the morning
investigating you serving all these minors.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.496
- We don't serve minors here.
- Oh, is that right?

55:57.520 --> 55:59.807
- No.
- Looks like a Katy Perry meet-and-greet to me.

55:59.920 --> 56:03.208
They will shut this fucking place down
while they investigate the charge.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.288
You think Luke is gonna like that?

56:05.400 --> 56:07.576
- What are you, a cop?
- You wanna fucking find out, motherfucker?

56:07.600 --> 56:09.170
- No.
- I didn't think so.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.487
Okay, get on that fucking phone.
- Fuck you.

56:14.360 --> 56:17.045
- Okay, I'll be back.
Are we 100% sure this is trouble?

56:17.160 --> 56:20.642
I mean, they were flirting all night.
- I am telling you, I know Emily.

56:20.760 --> 56:25.209
- Wait! I think I can track her iPhone!
I was setting Instagram up for her earlier.

56:25.360 --> 56:26.771
Let me check.
- Oh, my God.

56:26.880 --> 56:29.281
Are you telling me you can track
somebody else's phone?

56:29.400 --> 56:32.085
- I can pretty much do anything on one of these.
- Oh, yes!

56:32.240 --> 56:33.446
- Well?
- Nope, no answer.

56:33.560 --> 56:35.400
- Well, where does he live?
- I can't tell you.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.522
- Where the fuck does he live?!
- I can't say!!!

56:37.640 --> 56:39.674
- Forget it. I have a
read on where they are.

56:39.699 --> 56:41.555
They're on Flanders
Avenue heading south.

56:41.640 --> 56:44.176
- Okay, ladies, this is really happening.
We're moving out. Let's go.

56:44.200 --> 56:47.090
- Let's go, let's go!
- But wait! Our cars are at the restaurant.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.363
- Um... I can drive you guys.

56:50.480 --> 56:54.280
I've had nothing
but five coconut waters tonight, so...

56:54.400 --> 56:56.289
I'm Barry, by the way.
- I'm Jamie.

56:56.400 --> 57:00.246
- Yeah, I don't think we really got to
introduce ourselves officially, so hello.

57:00.360 --> 57:02.089
- Let's go! Let's move!

57:02.200 --> 57:04.043
(pop music)

57:05.080 --> 57:07.811
- Okay, I got a read.
Now she is off of Flanders,

57:07.920 --> 57:11.003
and she is on to Cabot,
heading west on Cabot.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.441
- Should we call Tom?
- No, no, do not call Tom.

57:13.560 --> 57:16.803
We don't know what we're dealing with yet.
- Oh, guys, you don't know her.

57:16.920 --> 57:19.605
She would not just fucking run off
with some strange guy.

57:19.720 --> 57:22.405
- Kate, I hate to say it,
but they seemed pretty into each other.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.284
- I got her. She just went left on Pacific.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.926
It looks like they're heading
to the Marina District.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.771
- Okey-dokey.
- Oh, I'm trying her again.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.285
Come on.

57:31.400 --> 57:34.722
(line ringing)
Pick up, pick up, pick up-

57:34.840 --> 57:37.241
<i>- Leave me the fuck alone already!</i>

57:37.360 --> 57:39.442
- What?
- That was not her.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.887
- Fuck, was that her?
- No, no, no. Try her again.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.048
- The signal stopped at the Marina.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.401
- Okay, we're tracking
her, we're closing in,

57:47.520 --> 57:50.205
and we're gonna get out
of whatever situation she's in.

57:50.360 --> 57:53.443
Are you cool? Are you cool?
You're cool, right? You're cool?

57:53.560 --> 57:55.240
Barry, you need to move this motherfucker!

57:55.280 --> 57:57.521
I've been in golf carts faster than this!
Let's go!

57:57.640 --> 58:00.689
- I'm sorry, my foot is cramping up!
I haven't had a banana today.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.566
- A white van. Everybody knows the only people
who drive white vans are serial killers.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.445
- One second, one second,
just got to adjust here. I'm sorry.

58:07.560 --> 58:10.325
- Wait, no, this is not the time.
- No, I can just...

58:10.440 --> 58:13.205
- Oh, Oh, my God!
Barry, just park the fucking car, man!

58:13.320 --> 58:15.766
- I know, I know.
It's disrespectful to other drivers...

58:15.880 --> 58:18.087
- Nobody's here!
Emily?!

58:18.200 --> 58:19.964

but my... I mean...
I'm married, I am married,

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.361

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.288

It was going very well.

- Look.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.208

for a few married women in my life.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.561
It's not... it's not the end of the world.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.083
- I got to go, I got to go. My friends
and... I have to wake up in the morning,

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.851
because it's a school
morning, so I got to go. Hey.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.769
- What?
- Okay.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.850
But you should kiss your husband like that,
by the way.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.046
- So you see anything out there?
- Sort of,

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.289
but it's so dark now
that I feel like I've lost sight of them.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.811
- Yeah.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.847
I'm not worried. I think you're
friend probably has Luke, like,

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.566
hog-tied and begging for mercy by now.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.802
- Oh, yeah? Well, let's hope so.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.402

you ladies are something else,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.244
I love it. It's very cool.

- Thanks.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.320
- So you're all... married, then?

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.370
- Oh, well, they are.
I'm not. I'm divorced.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.005
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.726
- I mean... I'm sorry.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.207
That's... that's too bad. Or... is it?

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.368
I mean, is it too bad?

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.484
- No, it's certainly better than being
married to my ex, that's for sure.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.364
- Right, yeah, good. Well, that's good.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.608
- Not bad.
- I mean, that you're happier.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.643
- Right.
- That's good. Yes, yes, yes.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.808
- I would say I'm definitely happier.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.689
Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.763
- So what about you?
Are you in a relationship or...?

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.564
- No, not right now.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.085
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.044
- So how did you get stuck
being the designated driver tonight?

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.128
- Oh, I volunteered.
- You did?

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.483
- Yeah, yeah. I don't
like drinking too much.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.171
It makes me feel all weird
in my head, you know.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.970
Are you cold?
- Oh.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.689
- A little chilly there.
- Oh, thank you.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.450

- I'm waiting.
- Waiting for what?

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.091
- Jaws jokes. On land tonight,
out here, you got nothing.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.804
- Oh, you're right.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.287
Shit. Oh, shit.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.084
Come on. Come on.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.089

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.523
I have never felt so sober
in my entire life.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.087
- All right, let's go look and see
if we can find Jamie and Barry,

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.846
and more luck than we did.
Come on.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.531
Come on. Come on.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.324
- Whenever.
- Okay.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.488
Come on, come on.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.686
- I love peanuts so, like,
a peanut beer, is that a thing?

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.928
- Fuck, yes.
- Yeah? It's a peanut.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.520
- Great idea.
Take that one step further.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.123
What if it's like a whole line
of, like, stadium flavours?

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.129
- Right.
- I.e.: peanuts,

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.561
hotdogs, pretzels.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.569
- Mustard beer.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.844
- Why aren't we writing this down?
- I don't know. 'Cause... You know what?

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.042
- All right, someone tooted.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.331
- Yeah, it was probably all of them.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.568
- How dare you fart on me?

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.489
- When my kids fart...

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.161
- Don't even finish the sentence.
- Dude, dude, dude, dude...

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.568
- Don't even finish the sentence.
- L... love... it.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.081
(guffawing)

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.009
- What do you binge on?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.407
I try to watch what I eat,
watch my weight, so...

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.808
- Oh, no, I mean, like, like, binge watch.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.763
Like Netflix? Amazon?

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.962
- Oh, yeah. Uh, duh.
(laughing)

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.369
No, I, um, I... don't really do
any of that stuff.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.729
I'm more of a regular cable-TV guy.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.888
- Oh, I love regular cable TV.
- Yeah?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.685
- As a matter of fact,
this is so embarrassing,

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.962
but I actually fall asleep
watching HGTV.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.641
- Oh, my God, me too.
Almost, like, every night,

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.286
I fall asleep watching Love It or List It.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.004
- I love that show!
- Yeah?

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.407
- Ever noticed how
they always choose to love it?

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.851
- Yes! Every time!
- Always.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.604
They always choose to love it.
- I know.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.007
I think they're gonna list it,
and then they love it,

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.536
then sometimes I'm, like:
"They're making us think they love it,

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.040
so they actually list it,
but then they just love it."

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.848
- I think you're an old soul, Barry.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.406
- Old soul? Aw.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.961
I like that. That's nice.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:11.610
The last girl I dated told me
I reminded her of a... bashful predator.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.290
<i>♪ Now the party's over ♪</i>

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.768
<i>♪ I'm so tired... ♪</i>

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.089
- Where are all of my friends?
- They are looking for you.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.046
They actually went bonkers. Uh, they thought
Luke had abducted you or something.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.083
- What?
- Yeah.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.646
- Don't worry about it.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.004
I'm... Listen, I'm sure they'll be back
soon. Just hang out here for a little bit.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.681
- No, I got to... I got to call Kate.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.404
Just... Okay. Except for...

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.725
I don't have my phone. It's gone.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.207
- Use my phone. Use my phone.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.448
I don't want any trouble.
Just take the phone.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.086
- Um... I don't know her phone number.
It's in my phone.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.725
- You don't know
your friend's number?

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.571
- No, I don't know my friend's number!
It's in my phone!

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.968
- Truly just trying to be helpful.
- Who knows anybody's phone number anymore?

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.243
Fuck technology.
- Oh, my God. Guys, I can just call Barry.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.601
- Who's Barry?
- Who are you?

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.850
- Barry is my buddy, and he took
all your friends looking for you.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.122
Looking for me where?

01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:13.870
You know what? They
were tracking your phone.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.361
- I don't have my phone.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.891
Fuck.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.843
(phone ringing)

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.287
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.880
Are you kidding me with that phone?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.446
- What?
Hello, it's Barry.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.081
Really? Emily's at the bar.
- What?

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.565
- Yeah.
- Can I talk...?

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.045
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hello?

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.482
(Woman): Ah!
(laughter)

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.966
- It's go time.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.009
- I'm right behind you.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.526
- Nice aft.
- Oh, God.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.644
If she came here willingly,
I'll fucking kill her.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.924
- Emily!
- Jamie!

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.168
- Ah... Oh, my God,
we were so worried.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.408
They still haven't come back.
- What the fuck?

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.330
Oh, you guys, we gotta get help.
This is bad.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.096
- Well, there's got to be Marina security.
They'll call in whoever to help.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.361
- That's a good idea. Okay, you go do that.
- All right.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.965
- Jamie.
- What?

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.924
- Look at me.
Where was the last place that you saw them?

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.326
- Down there.
- Take me.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.044
- Okay, come on, let's go.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.481
(dance music playing)

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.488
- Okay, where the fuck is Emily?!

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.446
- Hey, get off my boat.
- Your boat? Excuse me, matey,

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.131
but I'm gonna have to see
your license and registration.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.720
- Uh, Mel, let's just go.
Emily's not here.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.362
- It's my dad's boat,
but I'm gonna need you to leave.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:41.562
- Bae, be nice.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.721
They're homeless.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.569
- We are not homeless.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.041
- You must be hungry.
- I'm actually pretty hungry.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.370
- Okay, now's not the time. All right.
Somebody tell me what's going on here.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.171
- It's Senior Skip tomorrow,
so we're having a party.

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:57.567
- This is a party?
Don't bullshit me.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.728
- Oh, my God!
- There you are!

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.171
- Emily!!!

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.703
We saw your unicorn
hanging over the side!

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:05.667
Where the fuck have you been?!

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.810
- Uh, James, what are all these
old-ass MILFs doing on the boat? Ah!

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.520
What the fuck?
(pinging)

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.122
- Oh! Wait a minute.
It's here. Your phone is here.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.925
Did you hear that, that ping?
Here, look.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.804
- Were these kids at Luke's?

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.410
- Give me that bag.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.240
- That's... a coincidence.
- Gimme that bag.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.044
- No“
- Gimme that bag.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.287
Gimme your bag.
Give Melanie your bag!

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.323
- Stop, stop!
(pinging)

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.721
- What is this?

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.319
All right, was is this,
some kind of bling-ring shit?

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.562
It's that what you guys
are doing here, huh?

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.560
Taking phones and sell them
on the black market?

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.090
Is that what you're doing?
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.322
Yep, I've seen this on Dateline.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:49.569
- So what? Zoe lifts shit. That's
her thing. Everybody has a thing.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.286
- I catfish rich dudes.
- I pull fire alarms.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:55.131
- I'm a YouTube unboxer.
- What the fuck is that?

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.288
- Okay, all right, I steal things.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.209
Sorry, I can't help myself.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.004
Please don't turn me in.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.645
(dance music playing)

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.168
- So we're not gonna call the cops,
'cause we're cool as shit,

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.443
but you're all gonna pay the price
for Zoe's shenanigans tonight.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.489
You'll survive, Jamie.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.486
Now... you're all gonna be technology-free
for the next hour.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:19.650
Let's cut this electronica bullshit
and get some Peabo Bryson up in here.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.410
(sighing)

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.882
- Five minutes.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.684
Yeah, right.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.444
- Okay. Now, you're all gonna deal
with the extreme social awkwardness

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.484
that we had to deal at parties
back in the day.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.921
You ready for that? Here I come.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.441
All right, you're gonna face each other,

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.688
in the flesh, without a phone,

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.323
to filter out any of those oily
little teenage pores you got.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.930

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.569

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.330

- Okay, ready?

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.761
Never have I ever... had lice.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.564
- What?
- Ew.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.960
- Ew!
- Emily, I promise you,

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.518
just give it a few more
weeks at Happy Days,

01:11:36.543 --> 01:11:38.871
and you will be borrowing
my special comb.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.203
- No!
- I can't believe you've never had lice.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.731
- I'm so never having kids.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.126
(laughing)
- Good luck.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.129
- This is fun.
(laughter)

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.760
- I think we freaked them out.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.803
- Good. Little fuckers.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.048
- Never have I ever cheated on my husband

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.164
with an old boyfriend from high school.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.006
- How did I not know?
I thought it was Theo.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.805
- Yeah, I know.
That's what everybody thought.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.764
It's because I only post the pretty stuff.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.284
- You're the pretty stuff.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.805
- Never have I ever...
kissed another guy...

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.400
while I was married.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.090
- Emily.
- Whoa.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.804
- I stopped it immediately. I did.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.969
It was a mista...
It was such a mistake.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.209
I am... I'm telling Tom...
when I get home.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.004
- Are you sure?

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.571
- I'm terrified,

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.001
but I think...

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.964
I realized tonight
that I want my marriage to work.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.128
I want it to work with Tom.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.409
- You just have to fight for it,
sweetie pie. You know?

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.565
- All right.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.487
Never have I ever dressed up
my husband's dick as Napoleon.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.847
- Whoa, wait a minute. What?!
(laughter)

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.646
- Okay, you guys, remember, when we
went on that Alaskan cruise last year?

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.171
- Yeah.
