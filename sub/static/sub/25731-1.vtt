<i>I was an only child.</i>

01:54.875 --> 01:56.708
<i>Sort of solitary by nature.</i>

01:57.916 --> 02:01.291
<i>I learned to swim in the river
and that's where I met Loonie,</i>

02:01.458 --> 02:03.791
<i>who began to help me
understand fear.</i>

02:31.000 --> 02:34.291
Do you reckon you can
row this thing over the bar?

02:34.458 --> 02:36.375
The bar? I don't know.

02:36.541 --> 02:38.666
I guess, on the right day,
you probably could.

02:38.833 --> 02:41.083
I don't know if you'd ever
get her back again.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.416
Why would you want to do that?

02:43.583 --> 02:46.208
I don't know. It's the sea.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.666
Huh. Righto, drop it.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.666
There's more fish in here,
anyway, mate.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.625
But I don't reckon
you ought to do it.

03:14.791 --> 03:17.166
- So you reckon I won't?
- That's not what I said.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.916
- I just...
- Shh. Listen.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.500
Here he comes.

03:31.833 --> 03:34.250
I don't reckon
we should do this.

03:34.416 --> 03:37.375
- "We"? And don't follow me.
- I'm not going to.

03:37.541 --> 03:39.458
You'll just get skittled.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.166
Don't follow me.

04:12.458 --> 04:14.375
Mm. Mm.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.458
Lovely meal, Mrs Pike.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.791
I'm sure your mum
can cook a corned beef, Ivan.

04:21.958 --> 04:24.166
Mm. Nah.

04:24.333 --> 04:27.041
- How'd you get that eye?
- Cricket.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.291
Someone said
there were two boys

04:31.458 --> 04:33.416
playing on the highway
this morning.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.833
Said the driver nearly
lost control of his truck,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.500
he had to brake that fast.

04:37.666 --> 04:39.916
Oh, no. Those idiots.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.375
- Mm.
- I know those kids.

04:42.541 --> 04:44.625
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.583
Who are they?

04:48.750 --> 04:50.208
Oh,
just some ning-nongs

04:50.375 --> 04:52.541
from way up, way up from...

04:53.333 --> 04:54.916
...from...

04:56.625 --> 04:59.500
Angelus kids.
Yeah, those Angelus kids.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.750
Yeah, they're real...
real buggers.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.166
Ohh.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.083
Ooh. So delicious.

05:27.791 --> 05:29.625
I'm hoping
you've said your prayers.

05:29.791 --> 05:32.833
'Cause if God doesn't look
after you, no-one else will.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.791
Night, Ivan.

05:37.958 --> 05:39.875
- Excuse me, Mrs Pike.
- Hm?

05:40.041 --> 05:42.791
Do you reckon
I can get one of them?

05:45.291 --> 05:46.916
Thank you.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.583
I didn't know
you played cricket.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.000
I don't. I hate cricket.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.750
Got caught stealing
my old man's ciggies.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.625
Night, Pikey.

06:47.291 --> 06:47.333
Some old guy. They
were fishing off the rocks.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.833
Some old guy. They
were fishing off the rocks.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.666
- Did he drown?
- Yeah.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.291
Fucking sank like a stone.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.541
And your dad had
a front-row seat.

06:55.708 --> 06:58.041
So, there you are.

06:58.208 --> 07:00.500
That's why he doesn't want
you coming out here.

07:01.916 --> 07:03.083
Hm.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.458
- How far is this?
- I don't know.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.708
So, what would you do if she
put her hand in your pocket?

07:10.875 --> 07:12.958
Why would she?

07:13.125 --> 07:15.625
I don't know.
See what she could find?

07:17.875 --> 07:21.000
I know what she'd find
if she put it in my pocket.

07:21.166 --> 07:24.833
A flawlessly
well-sized Johnson.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.166
Smooth-touch wonder,
that's what she'd find.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.500
Look out. Move aside.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.125
Keep pedalling, boys!

07:33.291 --> 07:34.916
Look at that.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.916
Come on, boys.
Not much further to go.

07:41.791 --> 07:43.083
Got it.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.458
Hey, wait!

07:52.458 --> 07:54.208
You're gonna stack it! Let go.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.958
No, seriously, let go.

08:04.625 --> 08:08.166
Oh, ho-ho-ho! Oh, shit.

08:24.958 --> 08:26.541
It's pretty small.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.583
Oh, but nice and clean.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.791
I'm gonna go for a walk.

08:31.958 --> 08:34.500
Do you reckon
it'll pick up with the tide?

08:52.083 --> 08:54.000
<i>Never had I seen men do</i>

08:54.166 --> 08:55.708
<i>something so beautiful...</i>

08:56.791 --> 08:58.541
<i>...so pointless and elegant.</i>

09:04.083 --> 09:06.541
<i>As if dancing on water</i>

09:06.708 --> 09:09.291
<i>was the best and bravest thing
a man could do.</i>

09:32.125 --> 09:33.625
Thanks, guys.

09:33.791 --> 09:35.375
- See you, boys.
- See you.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.333
- See you.
- See you.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.041
See you!

09:45.833 --> 09:47.250
Hi, Mr Pike!

09:47.416 --> 09:49.041
Afternoon, Ivan.

09:49.208 --> 09:51.875
It's a good one, isn't it?
Bloody ripper, Mr Pike.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.875
Where have you been, mate?

09:54.041 --> 09:56.041
Oh, just for a ride.
They gave us a lift back.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.041
- Bloody ripper!
- Your mum's been worried sick.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.208
Alright? So, go inside
and say you're sorry.

10:00.375 --> 10:03.500
And come back out here and
take the chickens in, please.

10:15.541 --> 10:18.291
<i>The first boards we got
were Coolites...</i>

10:18.458 --> 10:20.166
<i>short, boxy, Styrofoam things</i>

10:20.333 --> 10:22.125
<i>that squeaked
when you touched them.</i>

10:22.291 --> 10:23.708
<i>They weren't much chop</i>

10:23.875 --> 10:26.041
<i>but we thought they were
the duck's nuts.</i>

11:14.125 --> 11:15.750
Yeah, there she goes.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.916
What we need, mate,
is real boards.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.875
Genuine fibreglass,
hard ones.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.625
With big stiff fins.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.541
What do you say, Pikelet?

11:31.875 --> 11:33.833
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.791
Ripper.

11:35.958 --> 11:38.791
Look at yous two
stupid pricks.

11:38.958 --> 11:40.791
It's raining.

11:40.958 --> 11:43.125
And the water's as cold
as a witch's bits

11:43.291 --> 11:44.708
and you're bloody swimming?

11:44.875 --> 11:47.166
We like "bloody swimming",
Dad!

11:51.875 --> 11:53.916
Five bucks a load
to chop it up.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.958
Are you interested?

11:58.125 --> 12:00.166
And there's four more loads.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.583
If you don't do it,
I'll get someone else.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.708
Hm?

12:09.875 --> 12:12.166
- 20 bucks a truckload.
- Uh-uh.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.708
- 15?
- Oh...

12:16.250 --> 12:18.166
Ten. Fuck it. Ten.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.875
Yeah?

12:22.041 --> 12:24.833
- Each.
- Yous can get to buggery.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.250
Ah. Come on.

12:37.708 --> 12:39.208
And I want to kill it.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.458
Oh. What are you doing?

13:02.875 --> 13:04.875
I don't want you telling
the other guys

13:05.041 --> 13:07.875
- where you got these from.
- Why not?

13:09.583 --> 13:11.958
'Cause they're shit boards.
That's why.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.583
- Oh. Thanks, Slipper.
- Thanks, mate.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.708
Mine's better.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.791
Mine's got wings. It's cooler.

14:41.333 --> 14:44.041
<i>My first wave that morning.</i>

14:45.291 --> 14:48.125
<i>I leant across the wall
of upstanding water,</i>

14:48.291 --> 14:50.416
<i>and the board came with me...</i>

14:50.583 --> 14:53.458
<i>as though it was part of
my body and mind.</i>

15:15.791 --> 15:17.416
<i>I still judge
every joyous moment</i>

15:17.583 --> 15:19.750
<i>and every victory
and revelation</i>

15:19.916 --> 15:23.000
<i>against those first few
seconds of riding that wave.</i>

15:30.208 --> 15:32.583
Wouldn't be dead for quids,
would you?

15:34.750 --> 15:36.458
Right. Up in the back! Go on!

15:47.000 --> 15:48.791
You boys need a ride?

15:48.958 --> 15:50.958
Our bikes are just
at the top of the hill.

15:51.125 --> 15:52.833
Yeah. Get in.

16:07.541 --> 16:09.000
Just here.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.708
Pair of hellmen, you two.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.250
What is that?

16:22.416 --> 16:25.166
Surfing bareback all weather.
How old are you?

16:25.333 --> 16:26.791
- 14.
- Almost 14.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.708
Bullshit. He's full of shit.

16:28.875 --> 16:31.875
Oh, 13 and a half,
then.Jesus.

16:32.041 --> 16:33.958
If you get tired of lugging
your boards,

16:34.125 --> 16:35.708
you can leave them
at our place.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.208
Jeez, thanks.

16:37.375 --> 16:40.416
First driveway on the left,
half a mile onto the bitumen.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.375
- Okay. Thanks for the ride.
- See you.

16:42.541 --> 16:44.208
OK, cool. Cheers, mate.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.083
Come on!

17:04.708 --> 17:06.583
What do you reckon?

17:06.750 --> 17:08.125
Mm.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.875
Hippies. That's what I reckon.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.540
Nah, fuck it.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.750
My arm's rooted.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.583
Hippies, alright.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.083
Hello?

17:44.125 --> 17:46.125
Anyone home?

18:36.625 --> 18:38.208
Oi. Come check this out.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.833
It's a total hippy love nest.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.125
You shouldn't
be up there, Loonie.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.458
Loonie, we should probably
just get going.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.625
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

18:50.666 --> 18:53.333
Don't get all fucking sulky
on me.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.875
"Probably should get going,
Loonie."

19:17.250 --> 19:18.916
Morning.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.541
Mm.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.041
Ohh...

19:48.000 --> 19:49.791
A Brewer.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.000
It's bloody paradise.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.583
You boys
take a wrong turn?

19:57.708 --> 19:59.333
Just came to get our boards.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.166
They're just in there.

20:01.333 --> 20:05.083
- Are they, now?
- Bloke said we could.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Better show me.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.041
This one's mine.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.958
That's his.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.875
Uh-huh.

20:25.916 --> 20:27.875
He's not here.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.708
- Who?
- Sando.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.208
- Who?
- The bloke.

20:32.375 --> 20:34.208
Oh, right, Sando.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.250
Ah. Where is he, then?

20:36.416 --> 20:38.041
Could be in Indonesia,
for all I know.

20:38.208 --> 20:40.416
- Really?
- No.

20:40.583 --> 20:43.083
It's not outside
the realm of possibility.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.708
So, what's your name, anyway?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.916
Eva.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.666
And where are you from, Eva?

20:56.208 --> 20:58.125
- From the US.
- Yeah.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.333
I can hear the accent,
but which part?

21:02.250 --> 21:04.666
- Utah.
- U-tar!

21:09.833 --> 21:11.583
Alright if we
drop 'em back later?

21:11.750 --> 21:14.833
'Cause we didn't ask...
your bloke offered.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.583
Uh... see you later, Eva.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.708
- I could tell she liked me.
- What?

21:25.875 --> 21:28.333
What? She was looking at me
with that special look.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.416
She wasn't looking
at anything.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.416
That's what I mean.
She cool-looked me.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.916
- She was keen.
- I don't know.

21:35.083 --> 21:37.041
Ah, you don't know
these things, Pikelet.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.875
You will, one of these days.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.791
She's probably his wife.

21:40.958 --> 21:44.250
Yeah, so? Aren't you
into those wives? Eh?

21:50.291 --> 21:52.833
<i>The sea was different
that day,</i>

21:53.000 --> 21:54.666
<i>but we went out anyway...</i>

21:54.833 --> 21:56.916
<i>because we didn't know
any better.</i>

22:11.416 --> 22:13.875
How about it, Snowy?

22:14.041 --> 22:16.208
- Are you going?
- Piss off!

22:16.375 --> 22:18.000
Here we go.

22:18.166 --> 22:19.833
Into it.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.875
Take the next one in, kid.

22:58.958 --> 23:00.916
Waiting for a little one, eh?

23:17.166 --> 23:18.458
Oh, shit.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.333
Listen, numb nut,

23:20.500 --> 23:24.083
if you don't get the next one,
I'm taking the one after that.

23:24.250 --> 23:27.333
You'll be out here on your own
all bloody night.

23:28.291 --> 23:31.791
Into it, son! Into it!

24:00.166 --> 24:01.875
What about mine?

24:02.041 --> 24:04.083
Did you see that?

24:04.250 --> 24:06.500
Oh, you got so skittled.

24:06.666 --> 24:08.250
- That was huge.
- Yeah.

24:08.416 --> 24:10.375
My one went all the way in.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.916
- He's out there, isn't he?
- Course he is.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.083
Fuck him. Jesus.

24:39.583 --> 24:42.500
- Whoo-hoo.
- Okay, come on, let's go.

24:42.666 --> 24:45.875
Only a bloody idiot would be
out there on a day like today.

24:49.041 --> 24:52.458
I'll surf that one day.
You dare me?

24:55.083 --> 24:56.958
I dare you to dare me.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.208
What is that?

25:04.125 --> 25:05.875
These guys built a raft

25:06.041 --> 25:08.625
and sailed all the way across
the Pacific on the current.

25:08.791 --> 25:10.625
Wow.

25:10.791 --> 25:13.000
- It's incredible.
- Mm.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.333
Uh... Are we um...?

25:32.500 --> 25:34.666
- You and... You and me?
- Yeah.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.791
Ah! Here they are.
Heckle and Jeckle.

25:47.958 --> 25:50.041
- Looking for trouble.
- Look at this.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.708
Oh, mate.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.958
Heard you boys got
a bit of swell the other day.

25:55.125 --> 25:58.708
Yeah. We um... It was
about seven or eight foot.

25:58.875 --> 26:01.416
Yeah. There was a couple
of nine-footers as well.

26:01.583 --> 26:04.791
- Yeah, it was massive.
- Seven or eight foot, huh?

26:04.958 --> 26:06.500
- Mm.
- Yeah.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.958
Well...

26:10.125 --> 26:12.208
...I'm gonna take this
for a spin.

26:12.375 --> 26:14.916
You got yourselves a lift
if you're looking to get wet.

26:15.083 --> 26:18.416
- Really?
- Yes. Get wet. For sure.

26:20.416 --> 26:22.375
Put your boards in the back.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.708
Rooster! In the back!

26:37.333 --> 26:38.875
Good boy.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.416
See you later.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.500
I caught one at least that.

26:59.666 --> 27:01.250
He was shitting himself.

27:01.416 --> 27:03.250
He'd never been out
in anything that big.

27:03.416 --> 27:05.125
Oh! Neither have you.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.875
I rode one the whole way in

27:07.041 --> 27:08.750
and then kicked down
on the sand.

27:08.916 --> 27:10.958
Well, that's impressive.
How about you, Pikelet?

27:11.125 --> 27:12.875
- Did you get any?
- Yeah, I got one.

27:13.041 --> 27:15.541
- Got skittled on the inside.
- Then later,

27:15.708 --> 27:18.291
the Angelus crew came and took
us to the top of that ridge,

27:18.458 --> 27:21.583
- to that bommie.
- Oh, yeah? Old Smoky.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.625
Yeah, that was going off.

27:23.791 --> 27:27.166
Yeah, there was someone
out there trying to surf it.

27:27.333 --> 27:29.958
Yeah, who is that guy?

27:30.125 --> 27:32.333
- Does someone surf that?
- Oh, on occasion.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.458
How would they get out there?

27:34.625 --> 27:37.041
Oh, that would be telling,
wouldn't it?

27:37.208 --> 27:39.958
Yeah, right, Old Smoky,
it was going off.

27:41.541 --> 27:45.208
It must have been
twenty-something foot easy.

27:45.375 --> 27:47.958
That's a big,
wild coast out that way.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.750
Full of surprises.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.000
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, mate.

28:00.166 --> 28:02.166
How are you?

28:10.166 --> 28:12.166
Mm. Delicious chops, Mum.

28:13.791 --> 28:15.791
You love your chops.

28:20.375 --> 28:22.708
Love, try and keep your nose
out of the sun.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.625
You know that hat
that Dad got you?

28:24.791 --> 28:27.500
- The fishing one?
- Yeah.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.708
- I reckon it's somewhere.
- Mm-hm.

28:41.708 --> 28:43.500
Tops day, Mum.

28:54.750 --> 28:58.375
<i>Once we were accepted,
allowed in,</i>

28:58.541 --> 29:01.416
<i>if we weren't with Sando,
we were just marking time.</i>

29:01.583 --> 29:04.541
All up through here,
waves all through that region.

29:05.625 --> 29:07.125
Have you been
up there before?

29:07.291 --> 29:10.166
Yeah, in this region,
several times down here,

29:10.333 --> 29:11.833
but never
that far north or west.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.041
So,
how do you get there?

29:19.833 --> 29:21.708
<i>We didn't know it yet,
but we'd already</i>

29:21.875 --> 29:24.583
<i>imagined ourselves
into a different life.</i>

29:43.333 --> 29:45.416
- See you, mate.
- See you.

30:12.833 --> 30:14.541
Oi!

30:14.708 --> 30:16.333
Look at this.

30:18.291 --> 30:21.833
"Sanderson:
Styling at perfect Rincon."

30:27.666 --> 30:29.875
He's on the front cover
of this one too.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.500
Look at him. Shit.

30:36.583 --> 30:38.833
This is Morocco in 1968.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.125
This is Hawaii in '71.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.750
- What?
- Yeah, what else is there?

30:49.583 --> 30:53.291
He's been all over the place.
Hollister Ranch. Where's that?

30:53.458 --> 30:56.083
- Look at him.
- <i>Oh...</i>

30:56.250 --> 30:59.000
Let's put 'em in order.

30:59.166 --> 31:00.791
'73.

31:00.958 --> 31:02.750
'71.

31:22.541 --> 31:25.041
Oi!
Nice haircut, man.

31:25.208 --> 31:28.166
What are you doing?

31:29.875 --> 31:31.916
Where the fuck
did you find those?

31:32.083 --> 31:34.208
Just um... They were
just there in the boxes.

31:36.916 --> 31:39.500
Alright, that's cool.

31:39.666 --> 31:41.375
Stack 'em up
and put 'em away.

31:41.541 --> 31:43.458
I want you to stay here
and wait for me, okay?

31:43.625 --> 31:46.291
Stay here and wait.

31:46.458 --> 31:48.250
- Eva!
- Quick, quick.

31:48.416 --> 31:50.500
Do you know how those boxes
got there?

31:52.416 --> 31:54.125
Hey!

31:54.291 --> 31:55.791
I'm talking to you.

31:55.958 --> 31:57.791
- What?
- What the fuck are you doing?

32:02.208 --> 32:05.750
Why do you keep them
if you hate them so much?

32:05.916 --> 32:09.000
I said, why do you keep them
if you hate them so much?

32:12.541 --> 32:14.500
- Liar!
- Don't take it out on me!

32:18.208 --> 32:20.041
Kids, Billy.

32:20.208 --> 32:22.041
Hanging out with kids.

32:37.125 --> 32:39.291
They're gonna kiss
and make up. Let's go.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.125
He said wait.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.166
Can I play?

33:08.333 --> 33:09.958
Piss off.

33:48.041 --> 33:49.916
Didn't mean
to piss anyone off.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.916
Ah, it's just a bunch
of old crap.

33:52.083 --> 33:54.291
Don't worry about it.

33:54.458 --> 33:57.083
Get your bikes in the back.
I'll give yous a ride home.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.333
Oh, listen,
there's a little spurt

34:27.500 --> 34:29.333
of swell coming
day after tomorrow.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.833
It should be offshore,
so get up early.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.041
- Early?
- Sparrow's fart.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.541
I'll pick yous both up.
We'll go somewhere discreet.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.291
Secret.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.208
Yeah. I think you're ready.

34:49.583 --> 34:52.458
Thinking of taking the dory
out fishing on Saturday,

34:52.625 --> 34:54.583
if you want to come, mate.

34:54.750 --> 34:58.250
Um... I'm probably gonna go
out to the beach with Loonie.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.333
Oh.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.083
Alright.

35:19.125 --> 35:21.166
Can I please leave the table?

35:44.625 --> 35:46.291
Oh!

35:46.458 --> 35:48.583
Where we going?

35:48.750 --> 35:51.166
Let's just say
we have an appointment

35:51.333 --> 35:52.958
with the undisclosed.

36:25.541 --> 36:27.541
They're yours.

36:29.416 --> 36:32.583
Oh, fuck! That's yours.

36:34.708 --> 36:36.916
- Look at that.
- Smell it. Go on, smell it.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.291
Oh, my God.

36:43.541 --> 36:45.166
Oi! Guide me in!

36:48.291 --> 36:50.333
- Yeah, keep coming.
- You're there.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.625
Oi, get my back.

36:55.291 --> 36:57.583
Do this. Quick.

37:38.916 --> 37:40.833
Where the fuck are we?

37:41.833 --> 37:43.916
This is Barney's.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.416
Drag her in.

37:57.958 --> 37:59.458
How come the name?

37:59.625 --> 38:01.625
Well, because Barney
lives here.

38:01.791 --> 38:03.458
Only fair to tell you.

38:11.166 --> 38:12.583
Wow!

38:19.583 --> 38:21.500
Whoo-hoo.

38:22.708 --> 38:24.458
Oh...

38:25.583 --> 38:28.250
- Oh...
- Oh.

38:28.416 --> 38:30.166
- Do it.
- Let's go.

38:35.083 --> 38:36.625
And what about
this guy Barney?

38:36.791 --> 38:38.333
Oh, Barney.

38:38.500 --> 38:41.541
Well, he's not hungry all the
time, which improves the odds.

38:41.708 --> 38:43.916
Fuck.
Tell me it's not a shark.

38:44.083 --> 38:47.500
Okay. It's not a shark.

38:47.666 --> 38:50.291
Well, it's not your average
shark, let's put it that way.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.708
- What?
- What?

38:51.875 --> 38:54.500
I've been coming for years.
Still got my fingers and toes.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.916
You've seen him?

38:56.083 --> 38:59.208
Yeah, five, maybe... six times.

38:59.375 --> 39:01.333
What kind of shark is this?

39:01.500 --> 39:03.416
Like I said,
not your average Noah.

39:03.583 --> 39:06.583
Stop pissing about
and fucking say it.

39:06.750 --> 39:09.666
It's a white pointer, mate.
The great white hunter.

39:09.833 --> 39:12.208
Fucking fuck fuck.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.208
- How big is this thing?
- Oh, 14 foot.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.083
I don't know.
It's hard to say, Pikelet.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.875
It's got a big old head,
though,

39:18.041 --> 39:20.041
and a grin like
Richard fucking Nixon.

39:20.208 --> 39:22.708
Why the fuck
did you bring us here?

39:22.875 --> 39:24.916
I thought you had
the nads for it.

39:26.458 --> 39:28.666
You're not scared,
are you, Loonie?

39:41.250 --> 39:44.791
He's bullshitting.
He's shitting us.

39:44.958 --> 39:46.458
Maybe.

39:46.625 --> 39:48.541
He's calling us fucking sooks.

39:58.208 --> 40:00.041
He thinks we're
just gonna sit here

40:00.208 --> 40:02.041
like a couple
of fucking girls.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.000
Mm.

40:04.166 --> 40:06.208
Fuck.

40:06.375 --> 40:08.416
It's some fucking good idea.

40:09.583 --> 40:11.750
Fucking... Fuck. Fuck.

40:16.791 --> 40:19.291
Ah, bugger the bloody
biggest shark!

40:29.791 --> 40:31.416
Come on!

40:35.708 --> 40:37.958
Come on!

40:50.625 --> 40:53.583
Oh, credit
where credit's due.

40:53.750 --> 40:56.208
You got the wave of the day,
mate. That was a smoker.

40:56.375 --> 40:58.708
Oh!
I wish we had a camera.

40:58.875 --> 41:01.208
It was too good.
We should have got a photo.

41:01.375 --> 41:04.625
- Ah, you don't need no photo.
- Just to show and prove it.

41:04.791 --> 41:07.583
You don't need to prove
anything. You were there.

41:07.750 --> 41:11.000
- At least you blokes saw it.
- My oath.

41:11.166 --> 41:13.041
It's not about us,
it's about you.

41:13.208 --> 41:15.250
Your moment with the sea.

41:15.416 --> 41:17.333
- That's hippy shit, man.
- What's that?

41:17.500 --> 41:19.083
It's fucking hippy shit.

41:19.250 --> 41:21.958
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

41:22.125 --> 41:24.500
Alright for you.
You've got plenty of shots

41:24.666 --> 41:26.208
to prove what you done.

41:26.375 --> 41:28.666
Honolua Bay, man. Morocco.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.750
It's all horseshit.
It's wallpaper.

41:30.916 --> 41:32.416
It's easy
for you to say.

41:32.583 --> 41:34.416
Son, eventually
it's just you and it.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.833
You'll be out there, thinking,
"Do I know what I'm doing?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.916
Am I solid?

41:39.083 --> 41:41.750
Or am I just ordinary?"

41:41.916 --> 41:44.083
- How does it feel?
- How does what feel, mate?

41:44.250 --> 41:45.625
When it's that serious.

41:45.791 --> 41:47.291
Ah.

41:48.541 --> 41:50.750
You boys will find out.

41:50.916 --> 41:54.250
Like, I mean... 20 feet.

41:54.416 --> 41:56.041
I'll tell you something, mate.

41:56.208 --> 41:58.458
You're glad
there's no bloody photo.

41:58.625 --> 42:00.125
But when you're still alive

42:00.291 --> 42:02.250
and you're standing there
at the end,

42:02.416 --> 42:04.500
and you've just made it...

42:05.666 --> 42:07.958
...it's not... You can't...

42:08.125 --> 42:11.166
You're completely alive,
completely in your body.

42:11.333 --> 42:13.416
You just get this rush.
It's...

42:15.250 --> 42:17.875
Ah, it's just like you've felt
the hand of God.

42:18.041 --> 42:20.416
The rest of it is just
sport and recreation.

42:54.666 --> 42:56.666
Can I have the flippers,
please?

43:32.041 --> 43:34.583
The waves that we're after
come ahead of the storm.

43:34.750 --> 43:36.833
Clean and powerful.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.625
Here's Old Smoky.

43:41.791 --> 43:44.208
It's about half a mile
off the coast.

43:44.375 --> 43:46.208
And this is
the continental shelf, right?

43:46.375 --> 43:48.125
So, when the wave hits here,

43:48.291 --> 43:49.958
the water rises up
on the shoal

43:50.125 --> 43:51.916
and turns itself inside-out.

43:52.083 --> 43:54.083
It's not so much about
the height and size,

43:54.250 --> 43:55.833
it's about the volume,

43:56.000 --> 43:57.500
the girth.

43:57.666 --> 43:59.291
That's where the power is.

43:59.458 --> 44:01.416
We'll paddle out here,
we wait in the channel.

44:01.583 --> 44:03.333
We check our position here,

44:03.500 --> 44:06.083
the limestone streak,
the line of trees,

44:06.250 --> 44:08.375
find the perfect
take-off spot.

44:10.333 --> 44:12.833
I mean, it's simple, really.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.583
You choose the right wave,
you're half way home.

44:15.750 --> 44:17.541
But if you judge wrong

44:17.708 --> 44:19.583
and you take off too far
across the reef,

44:19.750 --> 44:22.666
then you're in more trouble
than the early settlers.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.458
It's not about what's up here.

44:29.625 --> 44:33.000
Nothing to do with
the thoughts in your head.

44:33.166 --> 44:35.250
It's about the work
you've done.

44:35.416 --> 44:37.250
That and surrender.

44:38.875 --> 44:40.416
Surrender is what frees you up

44:40.583 --> 44:42.875
to be completely
in the moment.

44:43.041 --> 44:45.041
To commit with your body
and your soul.

44:46.208 --> 44:48.875
With complete certainty.

44:49.041 --> 44:51.208
Not a shred of doubt.

44:51.375 --> 44:53.541
Not a shred.

45:08.625 --> 45:10.291
Hey, Rooster.

45:11.583 --> 45:14.500
Hi. Where are they?

45:14.666 --> 45:17.208
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

45:18.166 --> 45:19.958
Where is everyone?

45:47.791 --> 45:49.708
What do you want?

45:49.875 --> 45:52.125
Sorry, I thought...

45:52.291 --> 45:54.333
I thought I heard
a noise and just...

45:54.500 --> 45:56.375
came up to have a look.

45:56.541 --> 45:59.666
You missed him. He's gone off
somewhere for a paddle.

46:00.833 --> 46:03.041
Breeze is all onshore, anyway.

46:03.208 --> 46:04.666
Yeah.

46:06.125 --> 46:08.416
What happened... to your knee?

46:12.208 --> 46:14.166
Skiing accident.

46:15.583 --> 46:17.791
Do you ever ski?

46:17.958 --> 46:19.875
No. I've never seen snow.

46:21.208 --> 46:23.166
Yeah, well...

46:23.333 --> 46:25.208
white and cold.

46:28.750 --> 46:30.416
How long till it's better?

46:30.583 --> 46:32.250
How long is a piece of string?

46:33.250 --> 46:34.958
What piece of string?

46:37.291 --> 46:38.791
It doesn't matter.

46:40.958 --> 46:42.666
Yeah.

46:42.833 --> 46:44.666
I'm sorry.

46:45.791 --> 46:47.666
See you.

46:57.250 --> 47:00.708
Old Smoky's right about here.
Let it go.

47:03.875 --> 47:05.708
It's deep.

47:05.875 --> 47:08.666
Well, it won't seem so deep
on the top of a ten-footer.

47:14.125 --> 47:15.916
Let's have a look, shall we?

47:20.625 --> 47:21.833
Wait.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.625
Loonie, wait!

48:28.083 --> 48:31.291
- Like chilli?
- No.

48:32.833 --> 48:34.500
Well, you're gonna learn to.

48:36.583 --> 48:38.583
This is new.

48:41.250 --> 48:44.541
That, Pikelet, is my wife.

48:44.708 --> 48:46.583
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.

48:46.750 --> 48:48.625
Far out.

48:48.791 --> 48:50.791
Yeah, pretty much
covers it, doesn't it?

48:50.958 --> 48:52.916
How does she do it?

48:53.083 --> 48:55.250
Big downhill run off a jump.

48:55.416 --> 48:58.583
She just soars through
the air while doing a flip.

48:58.750 --> 49:00.750
And lands on her feet.

49:03.083 --> 49:06.416
- Well, that's the plan.
- Jeez.

49:06.583 --> 49:10.666
Yeah, she's erm..
Mate, she's pretty well known.

49:10.833 --> 49:13.416
And that's Utah in '71.

49:13.583 --> 49:16.541
And she's been out now
three, maybe... four...

49:16.708 --> 49:18.458
More.

49:21.791 --> 49:23.416
She's over there right now.

49:23.583 --> 49:25.166
- Skiing?
- Jesus, no.

49:25.333 --> 49:27.333
Not with that knee.
She's erm...

49:28.666 --> 49:30.750
They're trying
another operation.

49:32.708 --> 49:35.583
- And they're gonna fix it?
- That's the hope.

49:38.583 --> 49:41.000
How can she stand it here?
There's no snow.

49:43.875 --> 49:45.666
I think she prefers it.

49:47.625 --> 49:49.458
I mean, if you couldn't surf,

49:49.625 --> 49:51.916
could you stand living
right next to the ocean?

49:52.083 --> 49:54.791
The ocean's beautiful.
That'd be enough for me.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.708
Bullshit.

49:57.875 --> 50:00.541
No, really.
You know, just to see it.

50:00.708 --> 50:03.458
Yeah, well,
I'd rather be dead.

50:29.791 --> 50:31.625
Keep the chicken wire
for me.

51:00.666 --> 51:02.541
They're okay.

51:02.708 --> 51:04.416
I don't want them here.

51:04.583 --> 51:07.166
Jesus Christ. Billy, grow up.

51:16.833 --> 51:20.000
Hey, Rooster.
There you go, mate.

51:20.166 --> 51:22.375
You boys need
to make yourselves scarce.

51:22.541 --> 51:25.416
No worries.

51:25.583 --> 51:28.666
Keep your eyes open. There's
something brewing down south.

51:28.833 --> 51:31.625
- Could be good for Old Smoky.
- Really?

51:36.208 --> 51:37.875
Welcome back, Eva.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.125
Let's just go
to your place.

51:46.916 --> 51:49.583
There's no way
I'd let my wife run the show.

51:49.750 --> 51:51.625
No way!

51:51.791 --> 51:54.083
He lets her get away
with so much shit.

51:57.791 --> 51:59.833
Reckon your mum's
done scones.

52:00.708 --> 52:02.708
I love your mum!

52:04.500 --> 52:06.625
<i>There was nothing else to do
but wait.</i>

52:09.208 --> 52:11.166
- <i>Then we got the word.</i>
- Good night.

52:11.333 --> 52:13.750
<i>Old Smoky was on.</i>

52:13.916 --> 52:15.666
God bless.

52:15.833 --> 52:18.333
<i>Unfortunately for Loonie,
two days earlier,</i>

52:18.500 --> 52:20.875
<i>he'd tripped down the stairs
at the pub...</i>

52:21.041 --> 52:23.583
<i>with a little help from
his old man, no doubt.</i>

53:02.208 --> 53:03.916
That's him.

53:07.750 --> 53:10.000
Come on, let's go.

53:10.958 --> 53:12.958
Are you shitting yourself?

53:32.666 --> 53:34.416
What's he up to?

53:34.583 --> 53:37.000
Hey, Loonie...
He doesn't want to watch?

53:37.166 --> 53:39.166
I don't think so.

53:42.541 --> 53:44.416
Hey, come and watch out
for your mate.

53:44.583 --> 53:47.125
Oh, and spoil
your secret hippy moment?

53:47.291 --> 53:49.333
- Watch and learn.
- Ah, no fucking worries.

53:49.500 --> 53:52.166
- I'd love that.
- Show a bit of support.

53:52.333 --> 53:54.250
What for? He's chicken.

53:54.416 --> 53:56.458
- You're a coward.
- Jesus, son.

53:56.625 --> 53:58.958
- Don't be an arsehole.
- Fuck off, coach!

54:22.458 --> 54:25.000
You're definitely getting wet
this morning.

55:46.625 --> 55:48.125
Feels onshore in here,

55:48.291 --> 55:49.958
but round there
it'll be clean.

55:50.125 --> 55:53.000
Getting out's the easy part.

55:53.166 --> 55:55.875
Coming in is when
you have to concentrate.

55:56.041 --> 55:58.041
You've got to be patient,
okay?

56:13.208 --> 56:15.416
Wouldn't be dead for quids,
would you?

56:18.458 --> 56:20.208
I wonder what
the ordinary people

56:20.375 --> 56:21.916
are doing today.

57:16.333 --> 57:17.791
What are you doing?

57:17.958 --> 57:19.875
- You ride the Brewer.
- Oh, are you sure?

57:20.041 --> 57:23.166
Yeah, yeah, just take it
before I change my mind.

57:23.333 --> 57:25.333
- Thanks.
- Now, watch what I do...

57:25.500 --> 57:27.500
and you follow.

58:09.250 --> 58:11.500
You've got to get into
some of that.

58:11.666 --> 58:13.708
You know what's what, mate.

58:13.875 --> 58:15.958
You'll never forgive yourself.

58:30.250 --> 58:31.791
Pikelet.

58:32.291 --> 58:33.958
Pikelet!

58:35.000 --> 58:36.750
Pikelet!

58:37.750 --> 58:39.666
Go out wide! In the channel!

58:39.833 --> 58:42.125
Deep water. Safe.

58:43.708 --> 58:45.166
Come on, mate.

58:54.416 --> 58:55.875
We'll do something else.

59:00.750 --> 59:03.583
Look at me.

59:03.750 --> 59:06.250
Let's just do something
different, alright?

59:08.958 --> 59:11.708
- We're gonna play a little game.
- Okay.

59:11.875 --> 59:14.375
We're gonna see who can
touch the bottom first.

59:14.541 --> 59:17.416
Ready? One, two, three.

01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:02.916
You're right here, Pikelet.

01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:06.000
You're right here right now,
okay?

01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:09.541
You just panicked, that's all.
We all do that.

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:12.208
You've got this, mate.
You've got this, okay?

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.333
Yeah? Let's do it.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.875
- Yeah.
- Let's have a go.

01:00:18.041 --> 01:00:21.208
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:24.291
Alright, mate. You're gonna
let the first one go,

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.375
let it draw some water.

01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:29.541
And then the second one's
got your name on it, okay?

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:32.500
Paddle to it,
turn and commit.

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:36.000
Not a shred of doubt.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.750
Got me?

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:45.458
Here we go.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:00:59.833
Go, Pikelet.

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:03.166
Go, Pikelet!

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:27.416
Pikelet!

01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:57.458
Yeah, mate. Good work.

01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:59.333
Good work.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.458
The next one's gonna be fun,
alright?

01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:04.208
Hold off with your bottom
turn, drop a bit of speed...

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.875
How big?

01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:15.375
Big enough to get the Boy
Wonder's heart started.

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:18.208
How big...

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:21.166
- ...Boy Wonder?
- I don't know.

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:23.250
Ten? 15?

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.416
Yeah. Ten, maybe.

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:28.750
Yeah. Surfed it at about ten.
Solid.

01:03:28.916 --> 01:03:30.750
So he got waves?

01:03:30.916 --> 01:03:32.708
Yeah, yeah, he did good.

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.916
I took
the worst flogging ever.

01:03:35.958 --> 01:03:37.916
But you did the deed.

01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:39.916
Made himself a bit of history.

01:03:46.958 --> 01:03:48.791
<i>He'd never be the first
or the youngest</i>

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.500
<i>out at Old Smoky,</i>

01:03:50.666 --> 01:03:52.500
<i>but he'd seen
what he had to do,</i>

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:55.250
<i>and by mid-winter
he'd finally got his chance.</i>

01:04:08.625 --> 01:04:11.583
<i>Whatever we did that day,
or any day,</i>

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:13.750
<i>Loonie did it harder.</i>

01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:21.875
<i>He went later
and deeper than either of us.</i>

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:26.208
<i>He hadn't simply taken
Old Smoky on.</i>

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:27.958
<i>He'd taken it over.</i>

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:32.291
<i>He surfed like someone
who didn't believe in death.</i>

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:39.750
Yeah, killed it, Loonie!
Killed it, mate!

01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:42.625
- Ripper!
- Owned it, mate.

01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:47.458
- That's the way.
- Fuck, yeah.

01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:26.958
Hey, hey! No, wait in the bus!

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:54.500
The truckie!
The truckie's stuck!

01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:15.375
Unlock it!
Unlock it!

01:06:20.833 --> 01:06:22.500
Unlock it.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500
Three miles offshore,

01:06:57.666 --> 01:07:00.041
a bommie off a granite
island... seal colony...

01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:04.250
holds a shit-load of swell
and gets very square.

01:07:04.416 --> 01:07:06.375
You launch
from the old whaling cove.

01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:08.541
- You've done it?
- I've scoped it a few times.

01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:11.458
- Buzzed out in the tinny.
- But you haven't surfed it?

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:13.458
You don't know
when to stop.

01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:15.833
No, actually, I think you do
know when you should stop,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.833
but you won't.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.791
No, Pikelet,
I haven't surfed it yet.

01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:21.458
There's a wave
inside the wave.

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:23.125
That's right, the Nautilus.

01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:25.666
The reef must be
right underneath the surface.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.916
Low tide,
it's above the surface.

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:31.083
You can only surf it
mid to high.

01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:34.166
The next frontier.

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:37.375
You think that's
possible? Really, honestly?

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:39.375
Honestly, Pikelet?

01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:41.458
I need to take a shit
just looking at it.

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:43.125
You scared, are you?

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:44.750
I'm scared.

01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:47.041
Yeah, well,
fear's only natural, mate.

01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:49.041
There's no shame in it.

01:07:49.208 --> 01:07:51.208
Whatever you reckon.

01:07:51.375 --> 01:07:53.416
People face down fears
every day.

01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:55.541
They make bargains with God.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:58.041
They make a decision,
they put their mind to it,

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.833
then they're half way there.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.791
Daring to try,
that's mankind for you.

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:04.791
I'm sure
you mean humankind.

01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:06.958
Yeah, thanks.

01:08:12.916 --> 01:08:14.958
We can always go back
to surfing the point

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:17.041
at two foot and sunny.

01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:24.041
Piece of piss!

01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:28.666
You're a turkey, Loonie.

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:31.166
- I didn't say I was scared.
- You are a turkey.

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:33.916
- He said he was scared.
- Turkey! Turkey!

01:08:45.582 --> 01:08:47.875
<i>We started our research
on the Nautilus.</i>

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.666
<i>Homework, Sando called it.</i>

01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:54.082
<i>But that winter
didn't amount to much.</i>

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.791
<i>And without swell,
we became bored...</i>

01:08:57.791 --> 01:08:59.500
<i>...and restless.</i>

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.332
See you.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.457
<i>Bruce Pike,</i>

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:35.041
<i>you are moody, selfish
and very inattentive.</i>

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:37.916
<i>Therefore, I hereby notify you</i>

01:09:38.082 --> 01:09:40.166
<i>that you are,
from this point forward,</i>

01:09:40.332 --> 01:09:43.375
<i>relieved of any further duties
as my boyfriend.</i>

01:09:43.541 --> 01:09:45.375
<i>Yours sincerely,
Queenie Cookson.</i>

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:58.708
<i>If Ahab has his way,
thee nor me nor any member</i>

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.125
<i>of this ship's company
will ever see home again.</i>

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:03.125
I hear Loonie's left school.

01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:05.416
<i>Come now, Mr Starbuck,
you're just plain gloomy.</i>

01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:07.666
Dad said
he's working down the mill.

01:10:07.833 --> 01:10:10.791
- <i>He ain't that big.</i>
- <i>I do not fear Moby Dick...</i>

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:12.791
Hm.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:15.916
- <i>I fear the wrath of God.</i>
- <i>The wrath of God?</i>

01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:20.500
<i>It is our task
in life to kill whales,</i>

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:23.416
<i>and furnish up their oil
for the lamps of the world.</i>

01:10:29.416 --> 01:10:31.583
<i>A monster storm showed up.</i>

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:34.416
<i>On the weather map, it looked
like a tumour on the sea.</i>

01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:36.416
<i>Sando was fired up.</i>

01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:38.708
<i>He was determined
we'd go for it this time.</i>

01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:30.708
When you go,
go early and go wide.

01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:32.708
I don't know
if I'm feeling it.

01:11:32.875 --> 01:11:34.541
Come on,
you know what's what.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:36.625
I think I'm just
gonna watch for a bit.

01:11:36.791 --> 01:11:38.750
Didn't bring you out here
to watch, mate.

01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:42.291
- Come on! Fuck, let's go!
- Just wait!

01:11:42.458 --> 01:11:44.916
Stuff this. I'm out of here.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:47.208
Look, I thought
I'd brought surfers with me,

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:49.458
men above the ordinary.

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:01.375
I said wait!

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.208
Man, you gotta taste
some of that!

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.208
<i>Hey...</i>

01:15:18.958 --> 01:15:21.750
<i>Hey, Rooster, boy. Hey...</i>

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:28.416
Come on.

01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:33.708
There you go.

01:16:01.333 --> 01:16:03.291
What are you doing
sneaking around?

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.958
Oh, I just came to,
you know, see Sando.

01:16:06.125 --> 01:16:09.208
- What?
- Just came to see Sando.

01:16:09.375 --> 01:16:11.333
Was that you the other night?

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.625
What? No.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.208
Doesn't matter.

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:19.083
Can you help me
with this stuff, please?

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.083
Pardon?

01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:24.250
Can you help me with
this fucking stuff, please?

01:16:24.416 --> 01:16:26.125
Fuckin' rain.

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:40.750
Do you want coffee?

01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:48.416
Oh, I can do that.
I'll make the coffee.

01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:50.541
You sit down.

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:52.625
Thanks.

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.791
How's your knee?

01:17:14.041 --> 01:17:16.166
Here we are, Pikelet.

01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:18.333
All on our lonesome.

01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:21.458
What do you mean?

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:24.625
- He didn't tell you either?
- Tell me what?

01:17:27.083 --> 01:17:28.791
He's gone.

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:31.083
Indonesia would be my guess.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.375
Took your little pal with him.

01:17:34.541 --> 01:17:36.208
- What?
- Yeah.

01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:38.250
Took Loonie
to Indo-fucking-nesia.

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:41.708
You're the lone musketeer.

01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:51.500
You couldn't have gone anyway.
You've got school and stuff.

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.791
- Yeah, but...
- Bad manners.

01:17:55.916 --> 01:17:58.916
Guru shit and bad manners
pretty much go hand in hand.

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:33.541
Do you want coffee?

01:18:34.958 --> 01:18:37.000
I don't even drink
bloody coffee.

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:39.958
Come on in and get dry.

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:43.125
You'll catch your death
out here.

01:18:43.291 --> 01:18:45.541
I'm getting you a towel
and a dry shirt.

01:19:07.791 --> 01:19:09.500
Thank you.

01:19:12.375 --> 01:19:14.375
- I can do it.
- It's alright.

01:20:01.958 --> 01:20:03.625
Hold me.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.750
Be nice to me, okay, Pikelet?

01:21:28.916 --> 01:21:30.625
I will.

01:21:32.416 --> 01:21:34.500
Don't brag about me.

01:21:37.166 --> 01:21:39.250
Not to Loonie, not to anyone.

01:21:40.166 --> 01:21:41.833
Okay.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.916
I won't.

01:21:58.166 --> 01:21:59.791
No-one.

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:18.000
I had a postcard
from Thailand.

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:22.875
There's waves in Thailand.

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:26.500
- He's been in Bangkok.
- Aren't they in Java?

01:23:26.666 --> 01:23:30.291
Something about supplies.
Who knows?

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:32.916
Now he's talking about
the eastern islands.

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:42.333
Why do you let him go?

01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:48.208
He needs it.

01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:52.916
What about what you need?

01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:59.083
He knows what I need.

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:05.083
It's getting cold.
You should go.

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:08.666
I can make a fire.

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:24.541
God, you're getting weirder.

01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:31.291
- What's been happening?
- Nothing. Nothing much.

01:24:31.458 --> 01:24:34.000
It's like you're off the air.

01:24:34.166 --> 01:24:37.250
Just got lots going on,
that's all.

01:24:37.416 --> 01:24:39.916
So, lots or nothing much?
Which one is it?

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.416
I still want you to take me
to the social, okay?

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:53.583
Will you?

01:25:20.583 --> 01:25:22.958
Those last few moments
in the air...

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:27.958
...they were the last
happy moments of my life.

01:25:32.875 --> 01:25:34.583
I miss being afraid.

01:25:36.125 --> 01:25:38.125
Maybe it'll get better
this time.

01:25:55.666 --> 01:25:57.708
I love you.

01:26:02.375 --> 01:26:04.208
You love getting laid.

01:26:07.333 --> 01:26:09.458
No. I mean it.

01:26:15.125 --> 01:26:17.125
You don't know what you mean.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:22.791
Don't say shit you don't
understand. Just don't.

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.125
Alright.

01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:39.375
Pick you up at 11:30.

01:26:49.916 --> 01:26:51.625
Thanks, Dad.

01:27:50.125 --> 01:27:51.708
I can't.

01:27:53.458 --> 01:27:55.416
It's nothing.

01:27:57.416 --> 01:27:59.375
Whatever you reckon.

01:28:45.916 --> 01:28:47.875
Want to play a game?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.750
I don't get it.

01:29:04.916 --> 01:29:06.625
I'll show you.

01:29:08.291 --> 01:29:10.375
What if I don't want to?

01:29:10.541 --> 01:29:12.541
I'll be disappointed, I guess.

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:17.583
Alright. Show me.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
You know
how to hyperventilate, right?

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:26.708
- It's kind of like that.
- You choke yourself?

01:29:28.083 --> 01:29:29.500
Sort of, yeah.

01:29:29.666 --> 01:29:31.875
Fuck, why?

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:34.541
Because, little man,

01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:37.416
makes me come
like a freight train.

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:40.875
What? You want me to...

01:29:42.833 --> 01:29:44.541
...choke myself too?

01:29:45.375 --> 01:29:47.375
No, of course not.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:51.791
I just want you to watch.

01:29:55.833 --> 01:29:57.916
Jeez, I... I don't know.

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:08.875
It feels better,
I can't tell you.

01:30:09.041 --> 01:30:12.916
And it's safer,
like having a dive buddy.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.166
I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

01:30:17.333 --> 01:30:19.000
I won't.

01:30:19.166 --> 01:30:20.750
Not if you don't let me.

01:30:30.208 --> 01:30:32.375
I love you.

01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:34.208
We'll see.

01:31:28.333 --> 01:31:30.041
Pikelet, it's okay, I'm fine.

01:31:32.916 --> 01:31:34.458
Look at me. I'm fine.

01:31:51.666 --> 01:31:53.500
Being scared's half the fun.

01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:57.625
You should know that by now.

01:32:06.958 --> 01:32:09.000
Does Sando do that to you?

01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:12.958
I don't have to answer that.

01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:27.125
I don't like it.

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500
I understand you, Pikelet.

01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:34.750
You're different.

01:32:36.166 --> 01:32:38.958
You've got this look...

01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:41.583
...like you're expecting
to lose something.

01:32:43.083 --> 01:32:45.000
And you're right.

01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:49.375
You're right to expect it
to be snatched away.

01:32:51.125 --> 01:32:52.625
'Cause it can be.

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:10.875
I don't know.
It doesn't feel right.

01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:16.125
I just don't think you should
ask me to do certain stuff.

01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:20.416
Yeah, I'll be here.

01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:50.791
Are you pregnant?

01:34:58.791 --> 01:35:01.458
Go home. Fun's over.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.958
- Is it mine?
- Don't be absurd.

01:35:35.791 --> 01:35:38.208
Well... I can...

01:35:38.375 --> 01:35:40.458
Do you want me
to chop some wood?

01:35:41.666 --> 01:35:44.000
No, I don't. Just go.

01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:43.291
Hey. How's it goin'?

01:39:43.458 --> 01:39:45.375
When did you get back?

01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:47.458
Last night.

01:39:51.083 --> 01:39:54.583
- So, how was it over there?
- Fuckin' unbelievable.

01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:58.166
We got everything.
We got shot at, seen off,

01:39:58.333 --> 01:40:00.250
spider-bitten, deported.

01:40:00.416 --> 01:40:02.250
And honkin' waves.

01:40:02.416 --> 01:40:03.750
I copped this.

01:40:03.916 --> 01:40:05.583
What happened?

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:07.833
Oh, just the reef.
Rips the shit out of you.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.833
Uluwatu. It's...

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.791
It's insane.

01:40:11.958 --> 01:40:13.875
You would've loved it.
Just big, smooth,

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:16.875
green walls
that just reel off for days.

01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:19.291
- Yeah.
- Wow!

01:40:19.458 --> 01:40:23.208
It was fuckin' amazing, man.
You really missed out.

01:40:23.375 --> 01:40:24.958
I brought you something.

01:40:25.125 --> 01:40:26.375
Here.

01:40:26.541 --> 01:40:28.416
- What is it?
- Close your eyes.

01:40:28.583 --> 01:40:30.500
Hold out your hand.

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.333
Don't look. Just smell it.

01:40:34.458 --> 01:40:36.125
It smells like shit.

01:40:36.291 --> 01:40:38.416
Had to get it through
the airport somehow!

01:40:38.583 --> 01:40:40.416
It's hash, mate.

01:40:40.583 --> 01:40:42.791
Had it up my date.
Johnny Cash.

01:40:42.958 --> 01:40:46.208
Put it in your pocket.
You'll thank me later.

01:40:49.458 --> 01:40:52.625
Lookin' tall and stassy,
Pikelet. Manly.

01:40:52.791 --> 01:40:54.833
Hm. I like it.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.583
But, um, heard you went out
Old Smoky and lost his Brewer.

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:02.041
- Yeah.
- Gonna be dirty about that.

01:41:02.208 --> 01:41:04.416
Could be dirty about
something else too.

01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:09.166
What are you talking about?

01:41:09.333 --> 01:41:11.250
Oh, nothing. Just gossip.

01:41:11.416 --> 01:41:14.458
Filthy gossip.
The old man, you know?

01:41:14.625 --> 01:41:17.166
Hm... Nautilus is gonna break
this weekend.

01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:18.833
- Yeah?
- Mm.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.291
Sunday morning,
Sando reckons.

01:41:21.458 --> 01:41:24.291
He said he wanted
to catch up with you.

01:41:24.458 --> 01:41:26.750
- I haven't seen him.
- He's scared of Nautilus.

01:41:26.916 --> 01:41:28.791
Shit-scared of it.

01:41:28.958 --> 01:41:31.000
He's getting old, but...

01:41:31.166 --> 01:41:34.375
Oh. Hello, Ivan.
Back, I see.

01:41:34.541 --> 01:41:36.750
Yeah,
back in little old Sawyer.

01:41:39.708 --> 01:41:41.208
Oh.

01:41:48.625 --> 01:41:50.666
See you Sunday.
Dawn's crack.

01:41:52.666 --> 01:41:54.208
Sando'll talk to you.

01:41:55.416 --> 01:41:56.791
Pssht.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.041
- How've you been?
- Yeah, good.

01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:54.083
Yeah?

01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:56.583
Chopped a lot of wood
out at my place, Pikelet.

01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:59.375
- Bloody lot.
- Yeah.

01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:03.166
Don't want you to think
I don't notice these things.

01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:05.625
Eva was glad for the company.
So she says.

01:43:05.791 --> 01:43:07.708
- Yeah?
- Mm.

01:43:07.875 --> 01:43:09.708
Got the board back.
The Brewer.

01:43:09.875 --> 01:43:11.416
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:43:11.583 --> 01:43:13.916
Tuna fisherman found it
25Ks out to sea.

01:43:14.083 --> 01:43:15.916
Yeah. Sorry about that.

01:43:16.083 --> 01:43:17.916
No worries, mate.
Don't need to be sorry.

01:43:18.083 --> 01:43:19.916
You took on Old Smoky
by yourself.

01:43:20.083 --> 01:43:22.000
That's up there, Pikelet.
Hats off, mate.

01:43:22.166 --> 01:43:23.791
That is up there.

01:43:23.958 --> 01:43:26.166
In my books,
you earned that board.

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:28.208
It's yours, mate. Yours.

01:43:28.375 --> 01:43:30.541
- Oh, thanks, but...
- No, no, it's yours.

01:43:30.708 --> 01:43:32.208
Okay?

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:35.916
Thanks.

01:43:36.083 --> 01:43:37.916
It's alright.

01:43:38.083 --> 01:43:39.791
Your mate Loonie...

01:43:39.958 --> 01:43:41.750
Jesus!

01:43:41.916 --> 01:43:44.166
Well, you know what he's like.

01:43:44.333 --> 01:43:46.416
Long story. Can't be trusted.

01:43:47.625 --> 01:43:49.291
Wilful little bastard.

01:43:49.458 --> 01:43:51.458
He's fuckin' nuts, actually.

01:43:55.041 --> 01:43:57.291
You know what else?

01:43:57.458 --> 01:43:59.125
What?

01:44:01.333 --> 01:44:04.208
Well, I think you know
what I'm talking about.

01:44:05.708 --> 01:44:07.458
No.

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.083
I'm gonna be a father.

01:44:14.166 --> 01:44:16.000
Yeah. I thought
you looked different.

01:44:16.166 --> 01:44:17.875
Did you?

01:44:20.625 --> 01:44:22.583
Well, are you gonna
congratulate me or what?

01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:24.458
Yeah! Course.

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:26.875
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

01:44:27.041 --> 01:44:28.958
So, listen, there's...

01:44:29.125 --> 01:44:31.375
There's a front
coming in from down south.

01:44:31.541 --> 01:44:33.875
Should be breaking at Nautilus
this Sunday morning.

01:44:34.041 --> 01:44:35.875
Good clean swell.

01:44:36.041 --> 01:44:38.250
Perfect angle.
You're gonna want to be there

01:44:38.416 --> 01:44:40.416
with that Brewer
under your feet.

01:44:41.416 --> 01:44:43.291
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

01:44:43.458 --> 01:44:46.083
Alright, mate. Well, I'll pick
you up Sunday at dawn.

01:45:43.208 --> 01:45:45.208
So, erm, yeah...

01:45:46.291 --> 01:45:48.083
Yeah, what?

01:45:49.458 --> 01:45:51.416
I'm not coming.

01:45:51.583 --> 01:45:53.416
Fuck.

01:45:53.583 --> 01:45:55.833
- You're kidding!
- No.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.958
It's not for me.

01:45:59.291 --> 01:46:01.250
It's an ugly wave,
and I don't like it.

01:46:01.416 --> 01:46:03.041
Bullshit.

01:46:03.208 --> 01:46:04.958
Get in.

01:46:06.166 --> 01:46:08.041
Get in.

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.458
It doesn't make me ordinary...

01:46:17.625 --> 01:46:19.500
or a coward.

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:22.541
It's just not for me.

01:46:29.166 --> 01:46:31.000
Okay, mate.

01:46:31.166 --> 01:46:33.416
Maybe you should get
your board out of the back.

01:46:33.583 --> 01:46:35.416
No, it's fine.
It's not even my board.

01:46:35.583 --> 01:46:39.333
I said you earned that board.
So it's yours, okay?

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.708
Now get your fucking board
out of the back.

01:46:51.458 --> 01:46:53.375
Pikelet, come here!

01:47:03.875 --> 01:47:06.041
You've got your own thing,
Pikelet.

01:47:06.208 --> 01:47:08.000
Don't lose that, okay?

01:47:10.166 --> 01:47:11.833
Now piss off.

01:47:55.125 --> 01:47:57.583
- Ah, ta.
- There you go.

01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:59.791
<i>There's fear in all of us.</i>

01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:02.125
<i>I know that now.</i>

01:48:02.291 --> 01:48:05.125
<i>It's how you live with it
that makes you who you are.</i>

01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:13.291
<i>Years later, when
I got the news about Loonie,</i>

01:48:13.458 --> 01:48:15.416
<i>I can't say I was surprised.</i>

01:48:16.416 --> 01:48:18.750
<i>But it hit me... hard.</i>

01:48:21.166 --> 01:48:24.166
<i>A single gunshot
to the back of the head.</i>

01:48:24.333 --> 01:48:26.333
<i>Some kind of drug deal
gone bad.</i>

01:48:31.125 --> 01:48:33.458
<i>He always lived
like he had nothing to lose.</i>

01:48:33.625 --> 01:48:35.625
<i>'Cause he thought
he didn't matter.</i>

01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:43.291
<i>Well, he mattered to me.</i>

01:48:48.291 --> 01:48:50.500
<i>I miss the mad bastard.</i>

01:49:01.625 --> 01:49:03.708
<i>I still paddle out
whenever I can.</i>

01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:08.291
<i>Not to prove anything.
Just... to feel it.</i>

01:49:09.375 --> 01:49:11.166
<i>That sweet momentum.</i>

01:49:11.333 --> 01:49:13.875
<i>The turning force under foot.</i>

01:49:15.083 --> 01:49:18.041
<i>And in those brief,
rare moments of grace...</i>

01:49:20.666 --> 01:49:22.208
<i>...I'm dancing.</i>
