is she alright?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.193
Oh, she’s much better,
she was right behind me.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.430
(Larry)
’Oh, Jennifer,
Jennifer, Jennifer!’

11:04.464 --> 11:06.466
Oh... Oh, Jennifer!

11:06.499 --> 11:09.335
Jennifer, Jennifer...

11:09.369 --> 11:11.271
Oh.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.807
[grunting]

11:13.840 --> 11:15.108
I missed you so much.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.910
I missed you so much
and I am so sorry.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.211
I’ll‐I’ll make this up to you.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.312
I’ll make this up to you.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.346
I...

11:24.350 --> 11:27.453
I‐I‐I know you’re angry
and you have every right to be.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.855
I’m not angry.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.425
Did you hear that?
Am I lucky or what?

11:32.458 --> 11:35.061
I am marrying the most
forgiving woman in the world.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.768
Larry, you don’t understand

11:41.802 --> 11:44.237
I’m not angry
because I’ve made a decision.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.806
What happened today was a sign.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.508
We shouldn’t get married.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.375
What?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.877
We shouldn’t get married

11:50.911 --> 11:52.245
we shouldn’t
have gotten engaged.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.247
I shouldn’t have
moved to Chicago.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.882
I should have stayed
in Iowa and gone into

11:55.916 --> 11:58.785
the family corn‐canning
business.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.754
But, Jennifer, you don’t
know what you’re saying.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.889
Yes, I do, Larry, I’ve given
this a lot of thought.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.859
I can’t go through with this.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.127
I’m going back to Iowa.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.332
Okay.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.036
Okay.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.539
I shoulda
seen this coming.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.340
I fall in love with
a beautiful woman

12:20.373 --> 12:21.508
she falls in love with me.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.176
I knew it was too
good to be true.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.047
Nothing works out
for Larry Appleton.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.219
I’ll think of you
whenever I eat creamed corn.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.524
Thanks.

12:37.558 --> 12:40.160
I’ll think of you whenever
I watch "America’s Most Wanted."

12:44.865 --> 12:46.399
Jennifer, Jennifer.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.434
Come on.

12:48.468 --> 12:53.373
I’m sorry, Balki.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.175
I don’t believe this.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.409
‐’What are you doing?’
‐Cousin?

12:56.442 --> 12:57.978
‐Balki, it’s over.
‐’It’s just not meant to be.’

12:58.979 --> 13:00.346
Now, wait just a minute.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.015
Just listen to me,
the two of you.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.417
Come over here,
come right over here.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.519
You’re being ridiculous!

13:05.552 --> 13:06.820
Now, don’t be!

13:11.024 --> 13:12.392
You always plan for

13:12.425 --> 13:13.594
for every little thing

13:13.627 --> 13:15.596
every little problem
that might come up.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.330
And then when a little
problem does come up

13:17.363 --> 13:19.432
that you didn’t plan
for, you go to pieces!

13:20.567 --> 13:22.035
So, okay.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.504
When life gives you lemons

13:23.537 --> 13:25.171
make furniture polish.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.412
You’re throwing away
all the joys

13:32.445 --> 13:34.414
of being married, for what?

13:34.447 --> 13:37.083
This is what they call
throwing out the baby

13:37.117 --> 13:38.284
with the trough water.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.556
And you will regret that
for the rest of your life.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.125
Now, you better start talking.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.432
Larry, I really don’t want to go
back to Iowa and can corn.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.968
Well, I don’t want you to go
back to Iowa and can corn.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.437
Well, you can’t go back
to Iowa and can corn

13:57.470 --> 13:59.606
your parents sold the farm
and moved to Florida, remember?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.110
Oh, right.
Larry, I want to marry you.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.445
And I want to marry you.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.248
Well, uh, maybe we
could change our plans.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.584
Well, I‐I‐I wanna
go with the flow

14:10.617 --> 14:14.054
uh, but I‐I just don’t know
what to do without my clipboard.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.360
You don’t need
a clipboard, Cousin.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.628
You don’t need a plan.

14:21.662 --> 14:22.929
All you have to do is know

14:22.963 --> 14:24.598
what you want and go for it.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.232
’Now, what do you want?’

14:29.102 --> 14:31.972
[instrumental music]

14:36.076 --> 14:37.377
Yeah, oh, uh...

14:37.410 --> 14:40.180
Reverend Peters wants us
to get started.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.281
Rudy, please.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.118
[instrumental music]

15:17.083 --> 15:18.251
Very nice, Rudy.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.322
Oh, okay, uh...

15:22.355 --> 15:23.590
Reverend Peters say that

15:23.624 --> 15:25.358
uh, he’s ready to begin.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.427
He, he’s got all
the wedding guests

15:27.460 --> 15:29.062
gathered around
the speaker phone.

15:31.998 --> 15:34.701
Okay, he says you
should join hands.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.405
Not you.

15:43.309 --> 15:47.080
Sit down, please.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.515
Okay, I got that.

15:48.549 --> 15:49.983
"Dearly beloved

15:51.652 --> 15:53.587
"we are gathered here today

15:53.620 --> 15:58.124
"to join Cousin Larry
and future Cousin Jennifer

16:01.595 --> 16:04.097
in holy macaroni."

16:09.803 --> 16:12.506
"Do you, future Cousin Jennifer

16:12.539 --> 16:16.209
"take Cousin Larry

16:16.242 --> 16:18.411
"to be your awful wedded husband

16:21.481 --> 16:23.717
"for rich man, for poor man

16:25.385 --> 16:27.621
for butter or moist?"

16:30.691 --> 16:33.560
Well, I‐I’m doing
the best I can!

16:33.594 --> 16:35.461
This whole thing would go
much more smoothly

16:35.495 --> 16:37.798
if I just married
them the Myposian way.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.533
’Would that be
alright with you?’

16:39.566 --> 16:41.101
He says it’s alright with him.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.202
Is it alright with you

16:42.235 --> 16:44.505
if I marry you
the Myposian way?

16:44.538 --> 16:46.472
There isn’t any livestock
involved, is there?

16:48.474 --> 16:50.243
Well, of course not.

16:50.276 --> 16:51.578
Don’t be ridiculous.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.381
Go ahead, Balki.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.583
(Balki)
’Okay.’

16:56.617 --> 16:59.319
The Myposian wedding
ceremony is very simple.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.523
Mary Anne, have you
got the ring?

17:02.556 --> 17:03.690
Yes.

17:03.724 --> 17:06.392
Give it to the future
Cousin Jennifer.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.665
Okay, put the ring
on Cousin Larry’s finger

17:11.698 --> 17:13.032
and repeat after me.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.671
Cousin, I give you this ring...

17:17.704 --> 17:19.071
"Cousin,
I give you this ring..."

17:22.442 --> 17:24.611
...as a symbol of my promise

17:24.645 --> 17:27.380
to love you
and to cherish you.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.282
"...as a symbol of my promise

17:29.315 --> 17:31.785
to love you and to cherish you."

17:31.818 --> 17:34.320
And to tend the flock
if you ever get a cold.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.295
"And to tend the flock
if you ever get a cold."

17:44.264 --> 17:47.868
Cousin, put the ring
on her finger

17:47.901 --> 17:49.369
and repeat after me.

17:51.437 --> 17:55.141
Jennifer,
I give you this ring...

17:55.175 --> 17:57.778
"Jennifer, I give
you this ring..."

17:57.811 --> 17:59.680
...as a symbol
of my promise

17:59.713 --> 18:02.115
to love you
and to cherish you.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.449
"...as a symbol of my promise

18:03.483 --> 18:06.252
to love you and to cherish you."

18:06.286 --> 18:09.289
And to chew your food
if you lose all your teeth.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.467
"And to chew your food
if you lose all your teeth."

18:24.270 --> 18:26.907
This is the part
where you tell each other

18:26.940 --> 18:28.341
how you feel.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.380
I feel really good.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.649
[chuckles]

18:36.850 --> 18:37.851
No.

18:38.819 --> 18:41.287
You tell each other

18:41.321 --> 18:42.889
from the bottom
of your heart

18:42.923 --> 18:45.759
how you feel
about pledging yourself

18:45.792 --> 18:46.793
to one another.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.395
Well, I‐I don’t, uh

18:49.429 --> 18:50.897
feel comfortable doing that.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.902
Cousin, I know you
don’t have it planned

18:55.936 --> 18:58.438
but, if you cannot
tell Jennifer

18:58.471 --> 18:59.773
how you feel about her now...

19:01.508 --> 19:02.709
...what are you saving it for?

19:07.881 --> 19:10.784
Jennifer...

19:10.817 --> 19:13.687
...wh‐when we first met,
I‐I‐I never dreamed that

19:13.720 --> 19:16.322
that we’d be getting married.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.892
And I just hoped that
you’d go out with me

19:18.925 --> 19:22.663
and‐and to this day, I‐I haven’t
figured out why you did.

19:25.265 --> 19:29.202
And Balki’s right,
I‐I can’t plan everything

19:29.235 --> 19:30.236
that’s gonna happen in my life.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.874
But I can plan on spending
my life with you.

19:35.776 --> 19:36.777
I love you, Jennifer.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.716
Larry, I went out
with you because...

19:50.390 --> 19:51.925
Well, I‐I’m sure
I had a good reason.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.629
No, no!
I know I had a good reason.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.865
You’re sweet
and funny and kind

19:58.899 --> 20:00.934
and no matter what lies ahead

20:00.967 --> 20:02.736
I want to share
the unexpected with you.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.572
I love you, Larry.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.546
Now comes the part
of the ceremony

20:12.579 --> 20:16.850
where I as official giver
of the vows

20:16.883 --> 20:19.620
’get to tell you how I feel
about the two of you.’

20:25.559 --> 20:28.895
Cousin Larry,
I never had a brother.

20:31.031 --> 20:34.500
Cousin Jennifer,
I never had a sister.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.906
If I did, I’d pray

20:39.940 --> 20:41.875
they wouldn’t be
as neurotic as you two.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.985
But I couldn’t love them
any more than I love you two.

20:53.954 --> 20:56.690
I wish you a long
and happy married life.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.996
By the power infested in me

and his majesty,
King Ferdinand of Mypos...

21:17.578 --> 21:20.480
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

21:20.514 --> 21:21.682
You may kiss the bride.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.929
This is so moving.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.698
Okay, I can’t let you
take the rap for me.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.900
I confess!

21:39.933 --> 21:41.401
I robbed the liquor store.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.504
Would you sit down?

21:47.841 --> 21:49.576
[instrumental music]

21:51.578 --> 21:52.713
Okay, everybody, get ready!

21:52.746 --> 21:53.747
Here they come!
