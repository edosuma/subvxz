<I>In here!</I>

00:17.208 --> 00:19.833
What's the emergency?

00:19.875 --> 00:21.458
Can you open this for me?

00:21.500 --> 00:26.208
You called 9-1-1 because you
couldn't open a can of tuna?

00:26.250 --> 00:28.625
No. First I called Bugs.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.708
Then I called my girlfriend,

00:30.750 --> 00:32.458
And then I called Porky.

00:32.500 --> 00:37.125
Then I called 9-1-1.

I'm leaving you."</I>

[crying]

01:24.417 --> 01:26.590
Ohh!

01:26.625 --> 01:28.750
I don't get it.

01:28.792 --> 01:30.792
What? Then why
were you crying?

01:30.833 --> 01:33.417
I always cry
when I'm confused.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.125
What didn't you get?

01:35.167 --> 01:36.875
Well, why was he so upset?

01:36.917 --> 01:38.173
Because of the Dear John letter.

01:38.208 --> 01:40.708
John? [scoffs] ok,
I thought his name was Edmund.

01:40.743 --> 01:43.417
No, it's just called
a Dear John letter...

01:43.458 --> 01:45.958
...when someone ends
the relationship with a note...

01:46.000 --> 01:48.083
Instead of face to face.

01:48.125 --> 01:49.167
Ohh, ok.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.673
So this was a sad movie.

01:50.708 --> 01:53.333
Hey, then why was I
laughing so much during it?

01:53.375 --> 01:54.590
I have no idea. Come on.

01:54.625 --> 01:57.167
Oh, I can't go anywhere.
Now that I know what's going on,

01:57.208 --> 02:00.667
I want to see it again.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.625
Can you believe
they charged me...

02:05.667 --> 02:06.958
...for coming out to the house?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.417
[stuttering]
it says you called 9-1-1

02:09.458 --> 02:10.833
...four times in the past week.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.458
And none of the emergencies
were valid.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.583
Oh, they were valid.

02:15.625 --> 02:17.625
Will you hand me that towel?

02:17.667 --> 02:20.042
Will you tell me
a bedtime story?

02:20.083 --> 02:22.048
Scarf, or no scarf?

02:22.083 --> 02:25.542
Why do they get to decide
if it's an emergency or not?

02:25.583 --> 02:28.875
Daffy, our emergency services
are under funded

02:28.910 --> 02:30.500
And overextended as it is.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.917
Our property taxes
aren't high enough.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.667
Why do you know
so much about it?

02:34.708 --> 02:36.833
Because I'm on the City Council.

02:36.868 --> 02:38.083
What's the City Council?

02:38.125 --> 02:40.667
The elected body
that runs the city.

02:40.708 --> 02:42.083
So you're like a big wig?

02:42.125 --> 02:43.708
[chuckles]
maybe to some people.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.958
How long have you been
on the City Council?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm about to finish
my third term.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.965
How did I never
know this about you?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.708
Because you never ask me
anything about myself.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.833
And when I try to tell you
anything, you interrupt me.

02:54.875 --> 02:58.667
And then on the few occasions where
I actually do get to say something,

02:58.708 --> 03:02.542
You literally
fall asleep from boredom.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.833

03:17.500 --> 03:19.833
Hey, I'm meeting Tina
for date night.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.375
Uh, why is the microwave
not working?

03:22.417 --> 03:24.465
Oh. I tried to open
a can of tuna with it.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.417
I thought if I got it hot
enough, the top would pop off.

03:27.458 --> 03:31.375
Daffy, you can't put metal
in the microwave.

03:31.417 --> 03:33.173
Well, I know that now, ok?

03:33.208 --> 03:35.292
The lesson's been learned,
all right?

03:35.333 --> 03:37.250
I'll never forget it.

03:37.292 --> 03:43.208
Real quick--you can or cannot
put metal in the microwave?

03:46.792 --> 03:48.167
[telephone rings]

03:48.208 --> 03:49.382
Pizzariba, this is Speedy.

03:49.417 --> 03:53.000
Hey, Speedy, who is that
handyman you use at the restaurant?

03:53.035 --> 03:54.955
You mean John?
Oh, he's the best.

03:54.990 --> 03:56.875
You want me to call him for you?

03:56.917 --> 03:59.250
That would be great.
The microwave's broken.

03:59.292 --> 04:01.500
No problem. I'll have him
drop by tomorrow.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.917
Just leave him a note.
- Thanks, Speedy.

Hey, Bugs!
I saw that movie again.

04:16.583 --> 04:19.916
Oh, you were right,
it was a Dear John letter.

04:19.952 --> 04:22.500
Oh, so sad.

04:23.250 --> 04:27.208
I hardly laughed
at all this time.

04:31.375 --> 04:35.000
<I>Dear John,
this isn't working. Bugs.</I>

04:35.042 --> 04:36.333
Oh, no!

04:36.375 --> 04:38.666
A Dear John letter?

04:38.701 --> 04:40.958
Bugs broke up with me!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.708
[sobbing]

04:44.458 --> 04:47.708
Why?!

04:50.583 --> 04:54.500
I'm sorry, sir, we're
completely booked this evening.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.167
You didn't make a reservation?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.833
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

04:58.875 --> 05:02.542
Ahem. You do know
that I'm a close,

05:02.583 --> 05:04.333
Personal friend of Porky Pig?

05:04.375 --> 05:08.375
Ah, that's City Council member
Porky Pig.

05:08.417 --> 05:11.583
Ooh.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.417
Who knew there were perks
to being friends with Porky Pig?

05:22.167 --> 05:24.667
Good-bye, apartment.

05:24.708 --> 05:27.167
I've decided to go away
for a while.

05:27.208 --> 05:30.000
Too many memories here.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.000
Ew! Oh, no, no, uh-uh, no.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.667
Uh-uh. Just because I'm leaving
doesn't mean you...

05:34.708 --> 05:38.625
...and all your little insect friends
can come in here and crawl around.

05:38.660 --> 05:39.917
Ok, you hear that, roaches?

05:39.958 --> 05:42.125
I'm talking to you, too,
spiders and ants.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.417
All of you. You stay out
of this apartment!

05:45.458 --> 05:47.167
And in case you need
a reminder,

05:47.208 --> 05:50.750
I'm putting a note
on the front door.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.185
Uh, Daffy, have you been
going all over town...

06:05.227 --> 06:06.810
...saying you're friends with me?

06:06.852 --> 06:09.227
Yes. And the results
are incredible.

06:09.269 --> 06:12.102
I used to be embarrassed
to admit I even knew you.

06:12.144 --> 06:13.685
But just this morning,
I threw your name around...

06:13.727 --> 06:16.894
...and I got a lifetime
gym membership for free!

06:16.935 --> 06:18.317
It wasn't for free.

06:18.352 --> 06:19.602
You told the girl
who worked there...

06:19.644 --> 06:22.227
...that the city would have
a parade in her honor.

06:22.269 --> 06:25.685
So? You're on
the City Council.

06:26.477 --> 06:29.435
You told the Maitre'd
at the Sunset Room

06:29.477 --> 06:31.394
That I'd name
a highway after him.

06:31.435 --> 06:33.519
Well, it got me
a really good table.

06:33.554 --> 06:34.810
You told that traffic cop...

06:34.852 --> 06:37.310
...that I could grant
his uncle's citizenship!

06:37.352 --> 06:38.560
What's wrong with that?

06:38.602 --> 06:41.810
This is the greatest country
on earth.

06:41.852 --> 06:45.185
It's unethical!
There's a reelection coming up,

06:45.227 --> 06:48.060
...and this makes it look like
I could be bribed!

06:48.102 --> 06:52.644
I understand.
It won't happen again.

06:52.685 --> 06:56.060
<I>Porky Pig voted not once,</I>

06:56.102 --> 06:59.317
<I>...but twice to make
our city dirtier.</I>

06:59.352 --> 07:02.310
<I>He voted to eliminate
garbage collection.

07:02.352 --> 07:06.310
<I>He voted three times
to allow dumping in the river.</I>

07:06.352 --> 07:09.935
<i>Why would a City Councilman
do such a thing?</I></i>

07:09.977 --> 07:12.310
<I>Because he's a pig.</I>
[pig squeals]

07:12.345 --> 07:14.727
<I>And pigs are filthy.</I>

07:14.769 --> 07:19.685
<I>On election day, let's send
this pig back to the farm.</I>

07:19.727 --> 07:22.977
<I>Vote Daffy Duck
for City Council.</I>

07:23.019 --> 07:28.435
I'm Daffy Duck,
and I approve this message.

07:30.769 --> 07:33.560
- What was that?
- An attack ad.

07:33.602 --> 07:34.935
But those are all lies!

07:34.977 --> 07:37.310
It doesn't matter.
Now people are going to have

07:37.345 --> 07:38.852
Negative associations with you.

07:38.894 --> 07:40.727
I can't believe
you're running against me!

07:40.769 --> 07:44.144
You're the one who said I
can't use your name to get perks.

07:44.185 --> 07:46.769
So, fine.
I'll get 'em myself.

07:46.810 --> 07:48.067
How could you do this?

07:48.102 --> 07:50.602
First, you don't want me
telling people you're my friend.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.602
Now you don't want me
telling people you're my enemy?

07:53.637 --> 07:56.102
Porky, you're a real
flip flopper.

07:56.144 --> 07:59.602
Ooh. I'll put that
in my next attack ad.

07:59.644 --> 08:01.310
[maniacal laughter]

08:01.352 --> 08:04.060
[coughing]

08:04.102 --> 08:05.227
[men vocalizing]

08:05.269 --> 08:07.269
I didn't know
where else to go.

08:07.310 --> 08:09.977
I can't stop thinking
about that Dear John letter.

08:10.019 --> 08:12.977
Oh, I just need
some peace and quiet.

08:13.019 --> 08:14.602
You'll find that here.

08:14.644 --> 08:17.435
True healing occurs
when one is clear of mind...

08:17.477 --> 08:18.602
...and calm of spirit.

08:18.644 --> 08:21.935
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah,
I totally agree with that.

08:21.977 --> 08:24.144
Your path is meditation.

08:24.185 --> 08:25.102
Mm-hmm. Ok.

08:25.144 --> 08:27.664
And the key to meditation
is silence.

08:27.699 --> 08:30.185
- Say what now?
- A vow of silence.

08:30.227 --> 08:32.394
For the next year,
you shall not speak.

08:32.434 --> 08:36.309
You know, I bet I could achieve all
that healing stuff without the silence.

08:36.352 --> 08:37.934
What do you think?

08:37.977 --> 08:41.373
I'm afraid the silence
is necessary.

08:41.408 --> 08:44.769
What I'm really quiet?
Does that count?

08:44.810 --> 08:47.185
[whispering] what about
now? What if I'm this quiet?

08:47.227 --> 08:49.144
No one will even know
I'm talking.

08:49.185 --> 08:50.894
Sorry, no. Not a word.

08:50.935 --> 08:53.394
Well, what about sounds?
Are they allowed?

08:53.435 --> 08:56.060
Like, when I'm surprised.
I'd go, whoa!

08:56.102 --> 08:57.727
Or when I'm bored,
I'd be like

08:57.769 --> 09:00.727
♪ deedaleelee,
deedaleedeedee ♪

09:00.762 --> 09:03.769
- Silence.
- Wow.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.810
Ok.

09:06.435 --> 09:09.185
[yelling incoherently]

09:10.227 --> 09:11.769
Oh, that felt good. Sorry.

09:11.810 --> 09:15.060
I just had to get that last one
out of my system.

09:15.102 --> 09:17.519
Newcomer Daffy Duck
has won a seat...

09:17.560 --> 09:18.644
...on the City Council,

09:18.685 --> 09:20.935
...defeating the incumbent
Porky Pig.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.352
Once again,
negative campaigns...

09:22.394 --> 09:24.727
...proved their effectiveness.

09:24.762 --> 09:26.394
Ohh! I won!

09:26.435 --> 09:27.935
I won, I won, I won!

09:27.977 --> 09:30.269
Let the perks begin!

09:30.310 --> 09:31.602
Shh, shh.

09:31.644 --> 09:33.359
[dialing]

09:33.394 --> 09:36.019
Oh! I keep getting
her voicemail.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.894
I haven't heard from Lola
in three days.

09:38.935 --> 09:41.185
I'm going over there.

09:41.227 --> 09:45.352
- Someone's going to need
new business cards.

09:45.394 --> 09:48.310
I bet I can get 'em for free.

09:50.935 --> 09:52.692
"Dear Bugs,

09:52.727 --> 09:57.060
I don't ever want
to see you again!"

09:57.102 --> 10:01.060
Lola broke up with me?

10:03.435 --> 10:05.025
Hey.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.192
Ooh, great.

10:06.227 --> 10:08.685
Oh, yeah, that's nice.
Good heighth on that.

10:08.727 --> 10:13.685
The Royal Oaks-Glen Oaks-Oakwood Oaks
City Council meeting is now in session.

10:13.727 --> 10:16.060
We open up the floor
to new business.

10:16.102 --> 10:18.019
Yes, I have a complaint.

10:18.060 --> 10:21.560
It's regarding the number
on the curb.

10:21.595 --> 10:22.525
The paint is--

10:22.560 --> 10:24.602
- How long does these things
usually go?

10:24.644 --> 10:26.894
There's an "Off-Duty Cop"
marathon on tonight

10:26.935 --> 10:28.269
And I'd like
to get home for it.

10:28.310 --> 10:30.560
I can't record it
because I broke the DVR

10:30.595 --> 10:32.060
Trying to open a can of tuna.

10:32.102 --> 10:34.227
- The meetings
are scheduled for five hours,

10:34.269 --> 10:35.977
But they sometimes run long.

10:36.019 --> 10:38.685
- ...But then that paint
faded as well.

10:38.727 --> 10:42.644
So, I would like to talk
about the kind of paint

10:42.685 --> 10:46.227
That this city uses
for addresses.

10:46.269 --> 10:47.914
Because clearly...

10:47.949 --> 10:49.560
Oh, come on!

10:49.602 --> 10:50.900
Is this really happening?

10:50.935 --> 10:53.644
What does she care
if someone can read her address?

10:53.685 --> 10:56.519
I've lived across the street
from her for six years.

10:56.554 --> 10:58.977
She hasn't had
a single visitor.

10:59.019 --> 11:00.852
[inhales and exhales]

11:00.894 --> 11:05.227
Just remember why you're here.

11:05.269 --> 11:06.894
The perks.

11:06.935 --> 11:11.185
This will be worth it,
because of the perks.

11:11.227 --> 11:14.602
[continues indistinctly]

11:15.852 --> 11:17.394
I like periwinkle,

11:17.435 --> 11:21.894
But I think that would be
a very bad choice.

11:21.935 --> 11:26.644
So in conclusion,
I propose a special committee

11:26.685 --> 11:28.935
To discuss paint quality,

11:28.977 --> 11:31.894
Paint color,
and paint placement.

11:31.935 --> 11:33.019
Thank you.

11:33.060 --> 11:37.394
- Thank you. And that
concludes the new business.

11:37.435 --> 11:38.185
Finally.

11:38.227 --> 11:39.894
And now onto old business.

11:39.935 --> 11:42.519
Concerning the speed reduction
on Maple Drive,

11:42.560 --> 11:45.602
I believe the choice
was between speed bumps

11:45.644 --> 11:48.102
And speed humps.
- [grunting]

11:48.144 --> 11:50.269
- Is that right,
Councilmember Bowls?

11:50.310 --> 11:54.102
- Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Speed bumps are conical,

11:54.144 --> 11:56.477
While speed humps are ovoid.

11:56.519 --> 11:58.310
Council-member Duck,
what are your thoughts

11:58.352 --> 12:00.852
On speed bumps
versus speed humps?

12:00.894 --> 12:04.769
My thoughts?
You want my thoughts, huh?

12:04.810 --> 12:09.269
My thoughts are that
you people are all insane!

12:09.310 --> 12:11.935
You let that old lady talk
for three hours,

12:11.970 --> 12:13.269
And she never said anything!

12:13.310 --> 12:14.977
In the amount of time
that that took,

12:15.019 --> 12:16.185
I could have gone over there

12:16.227 --> 12:17.727
And painted her address myself!

12:17.769 --> 12:20.435
I could have painted
the Sistine Chapel!

12:20.470 --> 12:22.519
I don't know about you people,

12:22.560 --> 12:24.567
But I have better things
to do with my time

12:24.602 --> 12:29.602
Than talk about whether
something is conical or ovoid!

12:29.644 --> 12:30.477
Ovoid!

12:30.519 --> 12:34.019
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have something

12:34.060 --> 12:35.644
That I need to get back to,

12:35.685 --> 12:39.935
And it's called a life.

12:44.185 --> 12:45.644
Unbelievable.

12:45.685 --> 12:47.310
Bunch of namby pambies.

12:47.352 --> 12:48.664
Ronald Reagan was right.

12:48.699 --> 12:49.977
Oh, hey, I'm supposed

12:50.019 --> 12:53.810
To meet Porky at Pizzariba.
You want to come?

12:58.102 --> 13:03.394
- I don't ever want
to see you again!

13:04.519 --> 13:09.269
- There's nothing
here for me anymore.

13:11.435 --> 13:14.144
- So you don't want to come
to Pizzariba?

13:14.185 --> 13:16.602
No perk is worth
sitting through that drivel!

13:16.644 --> 13:21.477
I mean, is there really a difference
between speed bumps and speed humps?

13:21.512 --> 13:25.227
- Well, one is conical
and one is ovoid, and--

13:25.269 --> 13:28.352
How long do I have to be
a City Council member?

13:28.394 --> 13:29.935
A term is four years.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.435
- Four years?!
I can't do four years, man!

13:33.477 --> 13:35.310
[cell phone rings]
Ooh!

13:35.352 --> 13:37.269
Someone just forwarded me
a video.

13:37.310 --> 13:41.102
- Is that the baby playing
piano? Already saw it. Fake.

13:41.144 --> 13:45.060
- Um...You might
want to see this.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.589
My toughts
are that you people

13:53.630 --> 13:54.839
Are all insane!

13:54.880 --> 13:56.464
You let that old lady
talk for three hours--

13:56.505 --> 13:58.505
- You better hope
no one sees this.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.714
You could get thrown off
the City Council.

14:00.755 --> 14:02.130
- In the amount of time
that that took,

14:02.172 --> 14:05.130
I could have gone over there
and painted her address myself!

14:05.172 --> 14:07.964
I could have painted
the Sistine Chapel!

14:07.999 --> 14:09.505
This isn't good.

14:09.547 --> 14:11.214
Or, is it great?

14:11.255 --> 14:14.214
[maniacal laughter, coughs]

14:14.255 --> 14:16.297
- Hey, man,
I saw that video of you

14:16.339 --> 14:17.464
At the City Council meeting.

14:17.505 --> 14:19.714
- I know what
you're going to say,

14:19.755 --> 14:22.589
And I owe you and all of you,

14:22.630 --> 14:25.755
My constituents, an apology.

14:25.797 --> 14:29.297
But, obviously,
apologies are not enough.

14:29.339 --> 14:32.297
And you the voters
will undoubtedly

14:32.339 --> 14:35.047
Want to remove me from office,

14:35.089 --> 14:36.964
Which I will accept.

14:37.005 --> 14:38.672
Though with a heavy heart.

14:38.714 --> 14:41.380
- Are you kidding me?
What you did was great!

14:41.422 --> 14:42.880
Say what?

14:42.922 --> 14:44.422
- You are the opposite
of a politician.

14:44.464 --> 14:47.464
You can't hide what you are
feeling. You just say it!

14:47.505 --> 14:48.720
You're a breath of fresh air!

14:48.755 --> 14:51.130
We're so lucky to have you
on that City Council.

14:51.172 --> 14:53.797
We need you there,
forever and always!

14:53.839 --> 14:55.047
Am I right?

14:55.089 --> 14:58.220
[cheers and applause]

14:58.255 --> 15:00.339
- Ok, so what kind of permits
do I need

15:00.380 --> 15:02.047
To put an addition
on the kitchen?

15:02.089 --> 15:03.297
It would extend it
to the parking lot,

15:03.339 --> 15:05.547
And I would require some
digging. So I think we need

15:05.589 --> 15:09.005
To talk about
construction permits, as well.

15:11.380 --> 15:14.047
[men vocalizing]

15:16.214 --> 15:19.005
Lola, it has been a year.

15:19.047 --> 15:20.714
Your vow of silence
is fulfilled.

15:20.755 --> 15:23.609
You should feel a deep
and lasting peace.

15:23.644 --> 15:26.464
You may now speak.
What do you have to say?

15:26.505 --> 15:29.179
I miss Bugs!

15:29.214 --> 15:31.672
[maniacal laughter]

15:31.714 --> 15:32.839
Hey, one more thing--

15:32.880 --> 15:35.589
[yelling incoherently]

15:36.880 --> 15:38.512
Hmm.

15:38.547 --> 15:40.380
Now...Here?

15:40.422 --> 15:42.964
I don't know where
these speed bumps go!

15:43.005 --> 15:44.012
[doorbell rings]

15:44.047 --> 15:47.380
- What?! You people
can't come to my home!

15:47.422 --> 15:51.714
I'm not a City Councilman
24 hours a day.

15:51.749 --> 15:53.172
Oh. Hey, Lola.

15:53.214 --> 15:55.755
- Where's Bugs?
I have to be with him

15:55.797 --> 15:57.130
Whether he wants me or not.

15:57.172 --> 15:58.797
I don't know where Bugs is.

15:58.839 --> 16:00.005
He left a long time ago.

16:00.047 --> 16:02.630
- What are you talking about?
- He got your Dear John letter

16:02.672 --> 16:05.005
And was completely devastated
and said something about

16:05.047 --> 16:06.297
Sailing to the end
of the world.

16:06.339 --> 16:09.839
- What?! How could Bugs have
possibly thought this was for him?

16:09.880 --> 16:12.255
Ohh. I'm coming for you, Bugs!

16:12.297 --> 16:16.880
And this time I'm talking
about the rabbit Bugs!

16:17.380 --> 16:19.255
Meeting adjourned.

16:19.297 --> 16:20.845
[indistinct chatter]

16:20.880 --> 16:23.214
- That was another
fun five hours.

16:23.255 --> 16:24.297
What are you doing here?

16:24.339 --> 16:26.589
- Just because I can't be
on the City Council

16:26.630 --> 16:28.839
Doesn't mean I can't
come to the meetings.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.922
- We really do
have nothing in common.

16:30.964 --> 16:34.130
- Did you hear about prop 14?
- What's prop 14?

16:34.165 --> 16:37.297
- They're calling it
the Daffy Duck provision.

16:37.339 --> 16:38.797
You're so popular,

16:38.839 --> 16:40.255
The voters want
to make your seat

16:40.297 --> 16:42.845
On the City Council permanent.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.213
- Then there's only one thing
left to do.

16:46.248 --> 16:49.547
- Embrace a life
dedicated to public service?

16:49.589 --> 16:52.255
No. Fake my own death.

16:52.297 --> 16:55.589
- Tragedy struck today
when popular City Councilman

16:55.630 --> 16:58.255
Daffy Duck lost control
of his vehicle

16:58.297 --> 17:00.880
And plunged into the icy
Sebastian river.

17:00.922 --> 17:04.797
All that was recovered
was his beloved parade float.

17:04.839 --> 17:09.047
And the city never even got
to throw him a parade.

17:09.089 --> 17:10.345
Former Councilman Porky Pig

17:10.380 --> 17:13.339
Has agreed to fulfill
the remainder of his term.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.630
This is Elmer J. Fudd reporting.

17:15.672 --> 17:17.672
[turns off tv]
- hey, Porky.

17:17.714 --> 17:20.005
Want some gently used
business cards?

17:20.047 --> 17:22.047
I'll put a speed bump here

17:22.082 --> 17:24.012
And the speed hump here.

17:24.047 --> 17:27.505
Oh, no. Oh, maybe
the speed hump goes there

17:27.547 --> 17:31.547
And the speed bump goes here.

17:34.047 --> 17:36.172
Bugs!

17:36.214 --> 17:39.505
Bugs!

17:39.547 --> 17:41.255
Bugs!

17:41.297 --> 17:43.922
Lola?

17:45.880 --> 17:48.255
Whoa-oh!

17:48.297 --> 17:50.012
Ohh.

17:50.047 --> 17:52.380
Wait. What are you doing here?

17:52.415 --> 17:54.005
You broke up with me!

17:54.047 --> 17:55.630
That note wasn't to you.

17:55.672 --> 17:57.797
It was to spiders
and ants and roaches.

17:57.839 --> 18:00.172
Don't you see?
I wrote "Dear Bugs",

18:00.214 --> 18:03.505
But you thought I meant
"Dear Bugs".

18:03.547 --> 18:04.589
Bugs.

18:04.630 --> 18:05.679
I need to be with you.

18:05.714 --> 18:07.589
I don't care about
the Dear John letter

18:07.630 --> 18:09.214
You left me on the microwave.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.512
Dear John letter?

18:10.547 --> 18:11.845
You mean the repairman?

18:11.880 --> 18:15.547
- Wait. Why'd you break up
with the repairman?

18:15.589 --> 18:19.047
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

18:32.547 --> 18:33.839
- Oh, Tosh?
- Yes, Chum?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.964
- Would you like to split
this tangerine soda?

18:36.005 --> 18:38.964
- Actually, I never have
carbonation in the afternoon.

18:39.005 --> 18:41.380
- I should have known that.
Terribly sorry.

18:41.415 --> 18:43.755
- No apology, Chum.
Let me cut you a slice

18:43.797 --> 18:45.589
Of this nice zucchini bread.

18:45.630 --> 18:47.422
- Oh, no.
I'm gluten intolerant.

18:47.464 --> 18:49.054
- Oh, of course you are.
I should have known that.

18:49.089 --> 18:52.130
- Well, I shouldn't have
thoughtlessly offered you that soda.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.589
- What is happening to us?!
- I don't know!

18:54.630 --> 18:55.672
It's like we're...

18:55.714 --> 18:59.630
- Not on the same page.
