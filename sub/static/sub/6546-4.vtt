00:01.210 --> 00:02.666
Audrey: Previously on Haven...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.709
-Jody?
- Don't come any closer.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.662
You have no idea
what I've already done.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.293
(electric whooshing)
- She came by the gull.

00:08.384 --> 00:09.715
Got the burn marks
to prove it.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.713
- Jody needs to
absorb light to stay alive?

00:11.804 --> 00:14.762
- I want you to hang on.
I'm not gonna let you die.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.465
- Nathan isn't looking for Mara.
He's working with her.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.970
(QaSPS)
- Nathan!

00:19.061 --> 00:20.926
- Parker.
- Don't talk to Mara.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.604
Talk to me.
It's the only way that I can fight her.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.192
- Dance with me, Parker.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.021
- Audrey.
- Yeah.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.613
- It's working.
- You do know where they are.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.153
- Nathan has her chained up.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.403
What is this? You two look like
you're on your honeymoon.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.233
- Is your head
about to pop off?

00:36.329 --> 00:38.160
- Were you really gonna help me
release a Trouble

00:38.247 --> 00:39.282
that won't kill people?

00:39.373 --> 00:40.579
- I'm the only one who can.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.073
- Mara.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.494
Dwight: I'm taking you in
right now.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.420
- I need to get
a Trouble out of Duke,

00:48.507 --> 00:50.498
or else he's going to blow.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.049
- She's right, Sasquatch.

00:52.178 --> 00:55.420
- And if he does,
all of you could be spattered

00:55.514 --> 00:57.766
with who knows what?

00:57.850 --> 01:00.842
I would suggest
that you wait outside.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.231
- The cabin's surrounded.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.852
She tries to leave,
take her down.

01:06.943 --> 01:10.106
- Where am I going to go?
- Just fix him.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.194
(door opens, Duke sighs)

01:17.203 --> 01:18.818
(birds chirping)

01:21.666 --> 01:23.622
(sighing)
They got some business in there.

01:23.709 --> 01:24.698
It's gonna be a few minutes.

01:24.794 --> 01:28.833
J‘J‘

01:28.923 --> 01:31.164
- Wuornos isn't back yet, so...

01:32.802 --> 01:35.259
I know you know
what's in the journal.

01:35.346 --> 01:38.930
Think. What is a Trouble
that won't blow us all to hell?

01:44.397 --> 01:45.386
- Scoville.

01:46.983 --> 01:50.191
- Scoville.
All right...

01:50.278 --> 01:52.894
Now keep that in the forefront
of your mind.

01:52.989 --> 01:56.732
I'm going to lay
my hands on you

01:56.826 --> 02:00.489
and then let your blood
drop all over the floor.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.909
(breathes deeply)

02:05.001 --> 02:05.990
- Wait.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.084
I am gonna pretend...

02:11.299 --> 02:15.338
that you are Audrey
and that I trust you.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.132
(inhaling)
- Duke.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.683
(@898)
Duke.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.519
Mara--
she can help you.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.346
- Audrey?
- Please.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.850
Just remember
it isn't your fault.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.649
- What?
What's not my fault?

02:37.033 --> 02:38.819
- Who said anything
about fault?

02:39.869 --> 02:42.326
Stop blabbering...

02:42.413 --> 02:43.402
Okay?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.328
Let's do this.

02:45.416 --> 02:49.876
J‘J‘

02:52.131 --> 02:53.120
(grunts)

02:54.342 --> 02:56.298
(gasping, heart pounding)

03:06.395 --> 03:10.058
J‘J‘

03:16.697 --> 03:19.313
- Something's wrong with Duke.
Mara says she can save him.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.649
- You just told us that
she gave us all our Troubles

03:21.744 --> 03:24.577
in the first place, and now you
think she saves people?

03:24.663 --> 03:25.652
(squeaking)

03:26.749 --> 03:28.239
Mara: I'm coming out.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.124
Duke unchained me...

03:32.046 --> 03:33.707
because he's alive.

03:33.798 --> 03:34.787
Mitchell: What?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.668
Don't shoot.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.708
(spits)
- Mitchell.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.883
- Thousands of people have died
'cause of her

03:43.224 --> 03:44.634
- Bother blather, polka dot.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.643
- Duke, you okay?

03:51.607 --> 03:53.393
- Mousey nudged
my smelly belly...

03:54.193 --> 03:56.525
(metallic slinking)
- She gave Duke a Trouble?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.769
- Bitch.
Dwight: Mitchell, stop.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.991
- Think of all the suffering
she caused.

04:04.954 --> 04:06.194
Or think of your daughter.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.030
- I am thinking of her and
Jody and all of us.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.833
Mara gave us the Troubles.
She deserves worse than death.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.036
But right now she's our best bet
to end all of this.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.417
- We need her alive.
- Bravo, G.l. Joe.

04:17.508 --> 04:18.588
Thank you.
Well said.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.041
- Hump a clump,
you witchy didgeridoo.

04:21.929 --> 04:22.918
(giggles)

04:23.013 --> 04:24.969
- Okay, what going on
with him?

04:25.057 --> 04:27.890
- He speaks nonsense,
but he thinks he's making sense.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.433
(laughing)

04:31.021 --> 04:32.636
What?
It's not gonna kill anyone.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.973
Oh-- Oh...
(cuffs rattling)

04:36.068 --> 04:38.855
Now G.l. Joe
is going to handcuff me.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.232
Oh, I like where
this is going.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.483
- I don't think
you're going to.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.738
(door opens and closes)

04:50.082 --> 04:53.620
J‘J‘

04:55.004 --> 04:58.667
J‘J‘

05:28.913 --> 05:29.902
(blinds clatter)

05:35.002 --> 05:36.367
- Give me some
of your kettle corn...

05:38.172 --> 05:39.753
from your secret stash,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.796
which I know you have.

05:41.884 --> 05:46.048
After all that hospital food,
I deserve some kettle corn.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.640
- That's more than
you deserve.

05:51.727 --> 05:52.807
- I don't know
what crawled up your--

05:52.895 --> 05:55.477
- Yet this is what
I give you.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.850
(clattering)
- What the hell, Vincent?

05:57.942 --> 05:59.557
- I nursed you back to health,

05:59.652 --> 06:01.313
although it cost me
the leadership of the Guard.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.813
- Dwight's not a bad choice.

06:02.905 --> 06:05.237
- And I did that
despite the fact

06:05.324 --> 06:06.860
that you tried to kill me,

06:06.951 --> 06:09.567
that you... lied to me
about your origins.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.161
All these years,
how could you never have told me

06:13.249 --> 06:14.955
Agent Howard arranged
youradopﬁon?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.995
Found your adoption file where
you hid it with Cabot's journal.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.673
- Go stuff
your high and mighty.

06:28.764 --> 06:32.507
I hid it so you wouldn't know
that I was from the other side.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.343
So you wouldn't force me to
that cave against my will.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.143
- Which you did.
- Stop that.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.096
- As far as I'm concerned,
we're even.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.808
No, wait.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.315
Now we're even.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.397
We can't function
like this, Dave.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.153
If you and I can't trust
one another...

06:51.870 --> 06:53.076
- It's bad.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.664
- All right, now think.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.827
That time in the cave
we can't remember,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.580
you took a beating
from someone or something.

07:00.713 --> 07:03.420
- It must be what
William promised

07:03.507 --> 07:05.839
and Jennifer confirmed
with her dying breath.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.544
Something terrible
came through that door.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.015
- Something we must track
down and stop.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.179
So no more games.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.258
You know something,
and you're gonna tell me.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.263
- The time's lost for me, too.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.846
We're talking about some
great evil beyond imagining.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.772
You don't think I'd tell you
if I knew?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.646
- I'm not so sure anymore,

07:25.571 --> 07:27.937
which means it's time
for the iron maiden.

07:30.326 --> 07:31.361
- You wouldn't dare.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.944
(rustling)

07:35.039 --> 07:36.245
(chomping loudly)

07:40.252 --> 07:42.914
- Sit me in the center
of the room,

07:43.005 --> 07:45.462
move everything
out of my reach...

07:46.842 --> 07:50.551
You want me to feel like
nothing is in my control.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.592
I guess someone read
the army field manual

07:54.808 --> 07:56.514
on interrogation.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.093
Oh, and my favorite--

07:59.229 --> 08:01.185
Move very slowly...

08:02.441 --> 08:06.480
so that I feel time
is on your side, not mine.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.739
Sorry, big guy, but
your lifetime

08:09.823 --> 08:12.155
is a fraction
of a second in mine.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.277
- Why?

08:16.372 --> 08:17.361
- Why?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.658
Why what?

08:20.668 --> 08:21.657
(laughing)
Why?

08:22.878 --> 08:24.379
Oh, the Troubles.
Right.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.913
Why not?

08:28.801 --> 08:32.134
Did you ever pull the wings
off of a dragonfly

08:32.221 --> 08:33.210
or...

08:34.515 --> 08:36.176
set fire to your cat's fur

08:36.266 --> 08:39.133
so you could see
what it smells like?

08:39.228 --> 08:40.718
- Setting fires,
torturing animals--

08:40.813 --> 08:42.724
you wet the bed, too?

08:42.815 --> 08:44.430
- You're less
than insects to me.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.319
- You want me to believe you're
on some kind of psychotic lark.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.272
But I'm not buying it.
You're on a mission.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.528
You need to find that Aether
that William hid.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.484
- Wow...

08:57.579 --> 08:59.991
Somebody
finally clued you in.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.572
- What is it for?

09:02.584 --> 09:03.994
What are the Troubles for?

09:04.086 --> 09:05.292
- Like I said...

09:07.631 --> 09:08.996
For fun.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.247
(disgruntled sigh)

09:11.427 --> 09:14.669
- Well, can I least get a name,
rank, and serial number--

09:14.763 --> 09:17.004
Who you are,
what you are, where you're from?

09:18.517 --> 09:20.098
No?
That's what I figured.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.178
It's okay, though,
'cause your mission's over.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.106
And there's nothing
that you can do about that.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.693
Only question now is,
how long do you live?

09:30.779 --> 09:33.020
That revenge
that Mitchell desires?

09:33.115 --> 09:34.230
The entire guard shares it...

09:35.701 --> 09:36.690
Including me.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.825
- I can cure the Troubles.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.744
What?
That's what this is about, isn't it?

09:44.835 --> 09:47.747
- And how do I know you're not just
lying to save your life?

09:47.838 --> 09:48.953
- Fine.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.124
I'll cure one person.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.761
J‘J‘

09:57.848 --> 09:59.054
- Trundle or bundle.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.220
- Duke?

10:02.311 --> 10:03.767
- Tongue my herring rubbed.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.344
- You have a Trouble.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.061
Did it come on
because of me?

10:10.152 --> 10:12.643
Will it go away
after I die?

10:12.738 --> 10:15.354
- Tackle the yak track.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.950
- I want you to tell
my children the truth

10:20.037 --> 10:22.073
when you can talk again.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.906
My husband, Gavin,
didn't run off.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.742
After I got fired,
we were screwed,

10:27.836 --> 10:31.078
so Gavin decided
to do one more job.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.710
It was supposed to set
us up for years.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.337
But it was with Bill Dimeo.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.713
It was a stupid risk.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.758
Gavin's dead,

10:40.849 --> 10:43.340
and it's all my fault.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.019
I hope you understand me.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.892
J‘J‘

10:49.983 --> 10:52.725
- Rusty livers bust in sour.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.311
(thuds)

11:00.244 --> 11:01.950
- You promised me 24 hours.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.369
- Toggle free powwow dozer.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.445
- What?

11:05.541 --> 11:07.031
- Hardy rob-knob tickle bee.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.659
- It's the new Trouble
Mara gave you.

11:10.754 --> 11:11.743
(grunts)

11:11.839 --> 11:13.750
- I thought you looked better.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.047
Here's your damn journal.

11:17.553 --> 11:20.590
Listen, Duke,
I am not crazy.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.423
Audrey is still in there.
We got to get her out...

11:23.517 --> 11:25.883
not for me, for Haven.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.593
Mara just wants
to destroy us.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.805
So bringing Audrey back,
that is how we get rid of Mara.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.890
What Dwight's doing now,
treating her like Mara--

11:32.985 --> 11:34.771
that just makes her stronger.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.070
You care about Audrey,
and you care about Haven,

11:38.156 --> 11:40.021
so help me.

11:40.117 --> 11:44.235
J‘J‘

11:49.751 --> 11:51.366
- Obsess less beetle buds.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.793
J‘J‘

11:56.884 --> 11:58.044
- She'll cure me?

11:58.135 --> 11:59.841
- She said she will.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.465
But I'll be honest,
I don't trust her yet.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.922
- Well,
if she makes me better,

12:05.017 --> 12:06.507
you'll know you can.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.760
And if she kills me...

12:09.855 --> 12:11.516
I was gonna die anyway.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.439
man: All right, move that truck.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.768
Let's go.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.447
Mara: Hello, boys.
Is this a rescue?

12:29.791 --> 12:32.123
- Flip the grip...
for foul my latitude.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.493
- Can't understand you, Duke.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.588
- Froggy leg cream.
Shoe?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.251
- I know why you're
risking your life to save me,

12:42.346 --> 12:45.008
but Duke-- he doesn't do
anything for free.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.215
He wants a
repeat of Colorado.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.097
Hasn't he told you about
that steamy night

12:55.192 --> 12:57.183
that Audrey and
Duke spent there?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.104
- Symphony turn tunnel.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.438
(laughs)
- Oh, it was so good.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.774
- Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny,
bunny, bunny, bunny... rabbit.

13:07.829 --> 13:08.818
(sighs)

13:17.673 --> 13:18.833
- "Delicious taco."

13:19.841 --> 13:21.706
(door opens)

13:21.802 --> 13:23.008
- Tickle my pickle.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.177
- Damn it, Nathan.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.087
- Dwight...

13:27.182 --> 13:30.265
Audrey is still in there.
Audrey can help us.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.934
Stop treating her like Mara.
You're making a big mistake.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.010
- Lock them both up.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.063
- Dwight.

13:37.567 --> 13:43.528
J‘J‘

13:44.700 --> 13:48.443
J‘J‘

13:48.537 --> 13:50.448
(rustling)
- Don't let the light in.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.995
Dwight: What are you doing?

13:52.082 --> 13:56.951
- I gave this Trouble
to your great... great, great--

13:57.045 --> 13:59.127
whatever grandmama.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.711
I think I know what I'm doing.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.299
(gasps)

14:13.395 --> 14:14.805
There we are.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.887
You won't need these
anymore.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.188
- No! No!

14:19.568 --> 14:20.557
(Jody gasps)

14:22.738 --> 14:23.727
Dwight: Jody?

14:24.698 --> 14:25.813
Jody: It worked!

14:30.037 --> 14:31.243
(chatter, door creaks)

14:36.793 --> 14:37.782
(door closes)

14:39.713 --> 14:41.499
- She cured me.
- For real?

14:42.591 --> 14:44.047
- For real.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.668
I shouldn't
have been the first.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.086
I killed my sister.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.762
- Go to your kids.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.680
They're what matter now, okay?

14:52.768 --> 14:54.099
Deb will give you a lift
into town.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.768
- Come on.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.056
- Call ahead.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.812
Make sure her kids are there
when she gets home, okay?

15:04.112 --> 15:05.488
- Hey.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.483
You got any bars?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.743
- Nope.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.697
(sighs)
- I don't know if I even care,

15:17.793 --> 15:18.999
but did you sleep with Audrey?

15:22.130 --> 15:23.370
(bird calls)

15:23.465 --> 15:24.875
- Slip the drink
in the pink.

15:24.966 --> 15:25.955
(bird shrieks)

15:26.051 --> 15:28.633
(thumping)

15:34.434 --> 15:35.423
(thuds)

15:37.395 --> 15:38.384
- Dead birds...

15:39.481 --> 15:40.641
Seen that before.
Is that you?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.142
(clinking)

15:52.911 --> 15:54.572
- I've got
12 Guardsmen on site.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.119
You'll cure them all.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.366
- Starting with you?

15:58.375 --> 16:00.707
- I go last,
after everyone in Haven.

16:00.836 --> 16:04.044
- Ugh, that's so noble,
I could puke.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.462
But, no.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.289
It's time for quid pro quo.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.466
- You've got some nerve.
No way.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.466
- Let's see how well you've
read that interrogation manual.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.764
- I didn'tjust read a manual.
I lived it.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.591
- Right. Yes.

16:17.686 --> 16:21.725
No, interrogations are
designed to elicit information,

16:21.815 --> 16:23.806
just like torture.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.765
But you don't need intel.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.772
You need...

16:27.863 --> 16:29.194
cooperation,

16:29.281 --> 16:31.442
which requires...

16:34.578 --> 16:36.193
Starts with an 'n"

16:36.288 --> 16:37.277
- Negotiation.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.612
- A-plus.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.618
- And let me guess--
you'll offer more cures

16:40.709 --> 16:42.574
as long as I help you find
your Aether.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.658
- It's a win-win.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.494
- Not a chance.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.921
See, you've got
a clear choice.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.044
On the one hand,
you can help us,

16:50.135 --> 16:51.124
finally do some good.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.801
- You think the Troubles
aren't good?

16:53.889 --> 16:57.347
You have no
idea about anything.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.970
- Or you can rot in my custody

16:59.060 --> 17:00.800
with no guarantee
of your personal safety.

17:00.896 --> 17:01.885
(door opens)

17:03.857 --> 17:06.018
- I said no interruptions.
- We got a problem.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.980
(chuckles)

17:10.071 --> 17:11.402
Nathan: There's nothing about birds,

17:11.489 --> 17:14.652
but your grandfather took care
of this gibberish Trouble

17:14.743 --> 17:16.074
back in '54.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.903
Andrew Scoville was Haven's
harbor pilot who stuttered.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.031
Caused a ship called
the Princess to wreck.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.162
- Tough muffin full of spite.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.335
- Bunch of people died.

17:27.422 --> 17:30.038
His guilt sparked this nonsense
Trouble that you have.

17:31.927 --> 17:32.916
(sighs)

17:33.762 --> 17:36.925
The monkeys happened
because you were in denial.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.846
You dealt with that,
stopped them.

17:40.435 --> 17:41.800
Mara let this
Trouble out in you,

17:41.895 --> 17:44.853
but wouldn't it need to attach
itself to some emotion?

17:44.940 --> 17:46.726
- Zig the zither to zag.

17:46.942 --> 17:47.931
- I mean, we're
all feeling

17:48.026 --> 17:50.187
all sorts of things at
the same time, right?

17:50.278 --> 17:51.518
Whether we're...

17:51.613 --> 17:53.945
- Serengeti peacocks
or lonely worms.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.490
J‘J‘

17:57.577 --> 17:59.863
- So you dealt with
the denial over Jennifer's death,

17:59.955 --> 18:01.946
but maybe you're
still feeling...

18:05.377 --> 18:06.537
- Guilty.

18:10.298 --> 18:13.836
J‘J‘

18:13.927 --> 18:15.758
There wasn't time before.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.131
I mean, I accepted
that she was gone.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.392
I still felt responsible.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.886
- It did attach to your guilt.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.348
HoW'd you stop it?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.979
- I just thought about all the ways
I tried to protect her.

18:33.905 --> 18:37.022
How I tried to stop her from
going in the cave.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.320
I mean, what else could I do?

18:42.414 --> 18:43.870
Lock her up?

18:43.957 --> 18:46.118
- No.
It was her decision.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.868
(sighs)

18:49.963 --> 18:51.453
Just for the record,

18:53.008 --> 18:55.499
I don't feel guilty
about anything else.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.006
Nothing happened
in Colorado.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.675
(thumping)

19:06.396 --> 19:08.478
- It's hard as rock.
- Yeah, it's not just the birds.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.146
Look at that barrel over there.
It's boiling.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.848
(bubbling)

19:11.943 --> 19:13.899
Hey, hey, look at that rake.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.568
(squeaking)

19:16.948 --> 19:17.937
It's got to be a Trouble.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.022
(bubbling)

19:19.117 --> 19:21.779
- Whoa, whoa. Watch it.
- What the hell, man?

19:21.995 --> 19:24.156
(screaming)

19:28.209 --> 19:29.335
I can't see!

19:30.003 --> 19:32.119
J‘J‘

19:36.176 --> 19:37.165
(rustling)

19:38.136 --> 19:39.842
- Okay.
Um...

19:41.222 --> 19:44.680
When Mara let out
that gibberish Trouble,

19:44.768 --> 19:46.258
she said it wasn't my fault.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.687
Maybe it wasn't Mara.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.562
It was Audrey.

19:55.653 --> 20:00.067
- She told you what the Trouble
was about ahead of time.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.318
You see?

20:01.409 --> 20:03.400
I told you,
she is still in there.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.360
- You're not as crazy
as I thought you were.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.117
- We need to get Dwight
to stop treating her like Mara.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.493
- Dwight's not crazy either.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.370
- Audrey is better for Haven.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.330
- Audrey can't cure
the Troubles.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.410
- So what?

20:15.256 --> 20:18.248
We just gonna sit around while
Dwight buries her for good?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.096
- No.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.265
Sitting here
is not an option.

20:31.189 --> 20:32.178
(rattling)

20:34.901 --> 20:36.482
(cuffs unlock, grunting)

20:40.907 --> 20:42.192
- I'm getting tired of this,
you two.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.864
l cuffed you
in front as a favor.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.783
- And we appreciate that.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.202
- You can talk.
- Shame, huh?

20:48.289 --> 20:50.416
- Okay, you need to stop doing
this other stuff you're doing.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.081
Killing birds,
blinding people?

20:52.168 --> 20:54.500
- Hey, the birds fell when
he was still talking nonsense.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.202
- I may have a bunch of Troubles
inside of me,

20:56.297 --> 20:57.753
but they only
come out one at a time.

20:57.841 --> 20:58.876
- Mara told you that?

20:58.967 --> 21:00.377
- No, it's how it's worked
so far.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.878
- Easy enough theory to test.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.131
We drive you
out to old route 6,

21:04.222 --> 21:06.258
weird stuff stops happening,
we'll know it was you.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.634
Meantime,
I got to talk to Mara.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.636
- Hey, Dwight...
Look, I don't care

21:09.727 --> 21:11.012
what you do
with us, but Audrey--

21:11.104 --> 21:12.093
- Audrey!

21:12.939 --> 21:14.270
You're like
a broken record, Nathan.

21:14.357 --> 21:16.769
- You need to stop
talking to Mara.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.600
You need to
treat her like Audrey.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.401
- The only thing that matters
is curing the Troubles.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.864
How do you not get that?

21:23.825 --> 21:25.361
- Lock them up tight.
- Okay, wait, wait, just--

21:25.452 --> 21:26.692
will you listen for one
more second?

21:28.496 --> 21:31.454
Dwight, I am telling
you, I'm not doing this.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.121
Which means it is one
of your guys.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.086
Now, Nathan and I
are your best option

21:38.173 --> 21:39.663
for figuring out
who this is.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.008
- I need assurances.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.927
- If Nathan tries anything
with Mara, I'll shoot him.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.263
In the foot.

21:50.685 --> 21:51.845
You won't feel it anyways.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.392
- I am not doing--
- You're in no position, Nathan.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.436
(bird squawking, thumping)

21:55.523 --> 21:57.059
man: What the hell is going on?

22:00.862 --> 22:04.571
- Can we please just focus
on the problem at hand?

22:05.658 --> 22:09.321
Listen, Nathan will not try
to steal Mara.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.528
Dwight will not talk to Mara.

22:11.623 --> 22:14.456
And we all work together
to figure out what is happening

22:14.542 --> 22:15.531
so no one gets dead.

22:17.587 --> 22:18.576
Deal?

22:20.131 --> 22:21.120
- Yeah.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.713
- Well, at least I know
there's no "e" in "grammar."

22:25.803 --> 22:26.792
- At least I'm not the one

22:26.888 --> 22:28.469
who printed the worst
dangling participle

22:28.556 --> 22:29.841
in the history
of our newspaper!

22:29.933 --> 22:31.719
- Of what is it
you are speaking?

22:31.809 --> 22:33.720
- "The boy collided
with a telephone pole

22:33.811 --> 22:35.221
running down the street."

22:35.313 --> 22:36.803
- No one's gonna think
a telephone pole

22:36.898 --> 22:38.604
was running down the street.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.727
- In Haven, they might.
(scoffs)

22:40.818 --> 22:44.106
Oh, thank God Strunk and White
don't read the Herald.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.529
- Strunk and White
can Funk my Wagnalls.

22:46.783 --> 22:47.772
woman: Boys!

22:49.911 --> 22:51.993
Over the decades
in this troubled town,

22:52.080 --> 22:53.536
the two of you have
referred to me

22:53.623 --> 22:56.035
many a broken relationship.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.661
- You're the best, Maddie.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.743
- They don't call you
"the iron maiden" for nothing.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.213
- Unfortunately,
the two of you

23:01.297 --> 23:04.334
are only now coming
to see me yourselves.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.211
We have oodles to unpack.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.670
For Vincent,
I sense enough anal retention

23:10.765 --> 23:12.756
to turn coal to diamonds.

23:12.850 --> 23:13.976
And David's oral regression

23:14.060 --> 23:16.346
suggests a fixation
for large breasts.

23:18.273 --> 23:19.479
Am I wrong?

23:23.403 --> 23:26.270
But that's not why
we're really here, now, is it?

23:27.949 --> 23:30.565
You two have a more immediate
problem to solve.

23:30.660 --> 23:34.369
- Involving violence
and time lost in a cave.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.197
- A cave?
Fascinating.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.453
- Maddie, please,
we need to know

23:39.544 --> 23:40.704
what happened there.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.501
- Our very lives
may depend on it.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.874
- All right.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.923
But as our
current approach

23:47.010 --> 23:49.251
has only resulted
in bickering...

23:49.345 --> 23:51.210
we'll need
a one-on-one technique

23:51.306 --> 23:56.016
to bore into your psyche and extract
your repressed memories.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.969
David, you're gonna go first.
Vincent, go take a walk.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.646
I'll call you
when it's your turn.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.900
- So, if you see
anything unusual,

24:09.991 --> 24:11.481
let us know right away.
Thanks.

24:13.828 --> 24:15.989
- These guys sure do
know a lot about their Troubles.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.492
- Yeah-- and none of them
can blind a guy

24:18.583 --> 24:21.245
or curl metal
or turn birds to stone.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.786
- Who's left?
- Just this kid Rhett.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.122
You know him?

24:27.216 --> 24:28.342
- Hey, Rhett.

24:33.514 --> 24:34.503
- Relax.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.010
We just want to talk.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.136
- You think it's me.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.479
- Well, it's
a distinct possibility.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.064
What's your Trouble?

24:42.148 --> 24:43.137
- I don't have one.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.723
- If you didn't think you had a Trouble,
why'd you join the Guard?

24:45.818 --> 24:47.274
- To meet chicks.

24:47.362 --> 24:49.193
- Guys have done
stranger things to get laid.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.147
(groans loudly)

24:55.995 --> 24:57.951
I told you it wasn't me.
Stop it!

24:59.207 --> 25:00.913
- We're not doing anything.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.080
- What's happening to me?

25:03.503 --> 25:05.039
(groans)

25:12.178 --> 25:14.385
(breathing heavily)

25:15.390 --> 25:16.755
Mitchell: He's dead.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.350
- You sure this isn't you?

25:22.230 --> 25:25.722
J‘J‘

25:25.817 --> 25:29.401
- Your thoughts become fuzzy.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.859
Your eyes want
to blink more slowly.

25:33.950 --> 25:38.159
(gaSPS)
How nice it would be to close them,

25:38.246 --> 25:39.861
but not yet.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.162
Repeat after me.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.740
"I want to remember..."

25:43.835 --> 25:45.291
- I want to remember....

25:45.378 --> 25:47.289
- "What happened in the cave."

25:47.380 --> 25:48.995
- What happened in the cave.

25:59.642 --> 26:03.305
- Allow your arms and
your legs to rest.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.683
Now, David,
close your eyes.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.818
(whooshing)

26:14.907 --> 26:18.616
J‘J‘

26:20.955 --> 26:22.786
(heavy breathing)

26:33.176 --> 26:34.165
(growling)

26:38.306 --> 26:40.843
- You didn't vent just one curse
from me, did you?

26:40.933 --> 26:43.185
- Oh?
What exactly did I do?

26:43.269 --> 26:45.555
- I think that you set off
a whole bunch

26:45.646 --> 26:48.137
of mutating
curses in me all at once.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.143
And they are killing people.

26:50.234 --> 26:53.351
- That sounds really devious.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.982
- So now you...

26:56.449 --> 26:57.438
are gonna fix me.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.367
Dwight: Poor kid.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.209
- White eyes, curling metal...

27:07.794 --> 27:08.783
(booming)

27:10.129 --> 27:11.244
man: What the hell, man?

27:11.339 --> 27:13.671
Nathan: What the hell is going on?

27:15.301 --> 27:16.336
- Whatever made
the water boil

27:16.427 --> 27:17.803
must have
heated up the gas until...

27:22.099 --> 27:23.259
And the birds.

27:23.351 --> 27:24.340
You couldn't tell
because of the feathers,

27:24.435 --> 27:25.470
but they were cooked.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.845
I think I know why.
(phone beeps)

27:30.233 --> 27:31.222
No signal.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.729
Listen, did you get a hold
of anybody about Jody's kids?

27:34.821 --> 27:36.903
Yeah, I got a text before
the signal disappeared.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.024
- The signal disappeared?

27:38.115 --> 27:39.104
- Yeah, it was good
when we got here,

27:39.200 --> 27:40.485
but then it went out.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.077
- When Jody was cured.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.278
Okay, listen up,
everybody.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.284
Get inside a
vehicle, close your doors.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.331
Now!
Move it! Move it!

27:49.418 --> 27:51.454
man: Let's go! Let's go!
man: Move!

27:51.546 --> 27:53.127
Dwight: Go-- Get in a car or a truck.

27:53.214 --> 27:56.081
(car doors closing)
- G.l. Joe...

27:56.175 --> 27:58.461
smarter than
the average bear.

28:02.765 --> 28:05.222
- I'm killing plants now, too?

28:05.309 --> 28:06.845
- Why not,
when you're figuring it out,

28:06.936 --> 28:09.598
you get in the car with
your buddies?

28:10.857 --> 28:12.222
- If it's me...

28:14.193 --> 28:15.899
Oh, I see.
It's not me.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.232
Dwight: It all makes sense...

28:22.326 --> 28:23.315
Microwaves.

28:24.078 --> 28:26.069
Someone has a Trouble
that sends out microwaves.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.949
- And water boils,
gas explodes...

28:29.792 --> 28:31.908
Over-nuked
chicken turns rock-hard.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.415
- Your eyes are like egg whites.
Heat them up, they turn white.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.086
- Rhett got cooked.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.880
And we're in cars because--

28:38.968 --> 28:40.549
- It's a giant glass
and metal box,

28:40.636 --> 28:42.342
like the metal box
around your microwave at home.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.341
It stops you
from getting cooked.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.218
- So it's all one Trouble.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.347
The question is,
who's doing it?

28:50.438 --> 28:53.430
- I don't know,
but I got a bad feeling.

28:54.317 --> 28:56.308
- You didn't cure Jody.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.482
You just changed her Trouble.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.106
She's still shooting these
beams of light.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.027
They're just
invisible now, right?

29:01.115 --> 29:04.107
- Yes, In I altered her curse.

29:06.913 --> 29:07.993
- How?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.115
Oh, let me guess.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.242
You must have found the stash
of your black goo.

29:11.334 --> 29:15.327
- No, l-l lifted it
off of Nathan a while back.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.707
He has no idea I have it.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.213
And Sasquatch--

29:19.300 --> 29:20.631
he didn't see me use it.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.374
(scoffs)

29:24.305 --> 29:27.172
- From visible light
to microwave.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.553
Microwaves are everywhere.

29:30.645 --> 29:34.058
Every cell phone
communicates via microwave.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.514
- And every satellite overhead.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.642
We're bathed in microwaves.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.273
- Weak ones.

29:41.364 --> 29:42.695
But now Jody--

29:42.823 --> 29:45.530
she is soaking them all in

29:45.618 --> 29:48.701
and concentrating them
into killer beams.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.658
Now, tell me
that wasn't genius.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.410
- Okay, so this is
a microwave Trouble.

29:57.505 --> 30:00.292
But what, you're suggesting we went
from light to microwaves?

30:00.383 --> 30:03.090
- The lights you see
and the microwaves that cook--

30:03.177 --> 30:05.259
they're both photons, just
different wavelengths.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.553
- So that means
Jody didn't get far.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.596
She must be around
here somewhere.

30:09.684 --> 30:12.096
- It's Jody.
I'm going after her.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.097
- Use your truck as a shield,
or microwaves will kill you.

30:15.022 --> 30:18.765
J‘J‘

30:22.863 --> 30:23.852
(tires squeal)

30:24.865 --> 30:26.321
- Jody!
- Duke!

30:26.409 --> 30:27.649
Deb crashed.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.449
She's dead.

30:29.537 --> 30:32.279
And In I think I broke my leg.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.362
(sighs)

30:34.250 --> 30:36.332
What's going on?
Why aren't you helping me?

30:40.881 --> 30:42.337
- Jody, listen to me.

30:42.425 --> 30:43.756
Mara didn't cure you.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.583
She just...
made your Trouble invisible.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.007
- You mean I... I killed Deb?

30:49.098 --> 30:50.554
- No, Mara did.

30:50.641 --> 30:54.805
I thought your Trouble started...
when Gavin left.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.021
But I was wrong.

30:56.105 --> 30:59.313
It started because you think
Gavin's death is your fault.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.389
- It is.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.224
He died because of me

31:02.319 --> 31:03.308
- No.

31:04.321 --> 31:07.404
Did you force Gavin to
take a job with an idiot like Bill?

31:07.491 --> 31:10.278
- I should have forced
him not to go.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.075
- Jody...

31:18.961 --> 31:20.747
Do you really think
you could've stopped him?

31:20.838 --> 31:23.625
J‘J‘

31:23.716 --> 31:25.081
It was Gavin's decision
to make.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.390
- David...
David!

31:34.477 --> 31:36.433
You can wake up now.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.509
- What happened?

31:37.605 --> 31:39.061
(sighs)
- You fell asleep

31:39.148 --> 31:40.934
and you snored like a tractor.

31:41.025 --> 31:44.062
Despite my best efforts,
the therapy was not successful.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.774
Perhaps we'll have more luck
with your brother.

31:47.865 --> 31:48.980
- Should I give him a call?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.781
- No, no.
I'll-I'll do it.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.408
- Oh, and, David?
- Yeah?

31:57.500 --> 31:59.786
- That thing on your leg...

31:59.877 --> 32:01.117
You might want to have
that looked at.

32:03.589 --> 32:04.578
- Yeah.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.006
(bells jingle)

32:08.010 --> 32:09.511
(door closes, cell phone beeps)

32:09.595 --> 32:10.584
(phone ringing)

32:12.264 --> 32:13.424
Vincent: Hello?
- Vincent...

32:13.516 --> 32:15.928
get over here right now.
l-l-l need to talk to you.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.554
You will not bel--

32:19.105 --> 32:20.970
(screaming)
Vince: Maddie!

32:22.483 --> 32:26.522
J‘J‘

32:34.453 --> 32:35.613
- All clear.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.616
(car doors closing)

32:38.707 --> 32:39.696
- Hey.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.248
Hey!

32:41.335 --> 32:43.417
You said you wouldn't talk
to her as Mara.

32:43.504 --> 32:45.369
- Until the Trouble was over.
It's over.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.079
- A Trouble she manipulated

32:47.174 --> 32:48.334
while you thought
she was curing it.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.551
Mara will not help us.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.045
- Okay, listen, everything
that's happened here today,

32:51.137 --> 32:52.297
it's on me,

32:52.388 --> 32:54.674
but she's still our best bet
at ending the Troubles.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.551
I just have to find
the right leverage.

32:56.642 --> 32:57.631
- Hey, Dwig--

32:57.726 --> 32:58.852
(chatter)

32:58.936 --> 33:00.676
- I hope he flays her
like a frog.

33:04.108 --> 33:05.723
- Two people
lost their lives.

33:05.818 --> 33:08.104
- I wanted Jody to kill you...

33:08.195 --> 33:09.901
you, your men.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.321
And that intolerable
Nathan Wuornos.

33:13.409 --> 33:14.615
- Her beams
could have killed you.

33:14.702 --> 33:15.942
- Her beams are narrow.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.869
If you feel the heat,
just move a bit.

33:18.956 --> 33:22.119
But the microwaves--
those were inspired.

33:22.209 --> 33:24.791
Even in their failure,
they were fun.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.164
- Nothing about you is fun.

33:26.255 --> 33:29.372
- Believe what you want
about my mission, Dwight,

33:29.466 --> 33:31.252
but the Troubles--

33:31.343 --> 33:34.085
they're
incredibly entertaining.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.545
I mean, come on.

33:36.557 --> 33:39.890
Oh, but the one I wish
I could have seen

33:39.977 --> 33:42.810
was the look
on your daughter's face

33:42.897 --> 33:44.103
when she died.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.639
Were the bullets confused

33:47.735 --> 33:51.023
when they chose which
one of you to kill,

33:51.113 --> 33:55.527
or did they just spatter
right into her little body?

33:55.618 --> 33:56.858
(chains jangling)
- Shut your mouth!

33:56.952 --> 33:58.158
- Make me, Dwight.

33:59.121 --> 34:02.204
I want to feel your hand
on my throat.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.202
Cut me open with a knife.

34:04.293 --> 34:07.330
Think of everything
that I've done.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.833
Think of your
daughter and hurt me!

34:09.924 --> 34:12.040
- You're sick.
- No.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.123
Just smart.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.627
You are weak,

34:16.722 --> 34:18.678
with too many scruples...

34:18.766 --> 34:22.759
(chains jangle)
And no other option but me.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.896
(breathing heavily)

34:30.444 --> 34:32.230
- I see why Nathan wants
Audrey back.

34:35.491 --> 34:38.028
I remember that day
you went in the barn.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.450
I'd never seen a woman
so brave.

34:41.497 --> 34:42.987
You're a real hero.

34:44.792 --> 34:45.781
- Good-bye, Dwight.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.830
- Sorry about the mess.
- I got it.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.125
A hero to Troubled people.

35:00.683 --> 35:01.798
- I'm sorry about the mess.

35:03.811 --> 35:04.800
- What?

35:06.146 --> 35:07.682
- Oh, Dwight.

35:07.773 --> 35:08.762
(whimpering)

35:08.857 --> 35:09.846
Uangﬂng)

35:10.859 --> 35:12.565
(panicked breathing)

35:12.653 --> 35:13.938
Help me.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.486
(birds chirping)

35:27.084 --> 35:28.073
(sighs)

35:28.168 --> 35:30.420
- She called my bluff.

35:30.504 --> 35:31.539
As long as she's got
a cure to the Troubles,

35:31.672 --> 35:32.912
Mara knows I'll never
hurt her.

35:36.844 --> 35:39.176
Evenless
likely now, 'cause I, uh...

35:40.180 --> 35:41.169
saw Audrey.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.308
Just for a second.

35:43.392 --> 35:44.928
- You see?

35:45.019 --> 35:46.134
We have to help her.

35:46.228 --> 35:47.729
- Nathan, I've always been a
fan of you and Audrey,

35:47.813 --> 35:50.600
but Mara is the only one that
can possibly cure the Troubles.

35:50.691 --> 35:51.897
Audrey never could.

35:53.027 --> 35:54.892
- But what if she can now?

35:54.987 --> 35:56.022
I know it might sound crazy,

35:56.113 --> 35:58.024
but if Mara has
all of Audrey's memories,

35:58.115 --> 36:00.447
maybe when Audrey turned
back into Mara,

36:00.701 --> 36:02.487
maybe she got all
of Mara's memories, too.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.448
J‘J‘

36:05.539 --> 36:06.528
When Audrey came out,

36:06.623 --> 36:08.238
she said
that it wasn't my fault.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.368
She knew that the Scoville curse
was about guilt.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.621
- Even though that was
1954 and Audrey wasn't there.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.794
- We have to turn Mara
back into Audrey.

36:18.886 --> 36:20.717
- The barn has always
controlled her personality,

36:20.804 --> 36:22.886
making sure that she pretty much
didn't know anything.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.474
- So you think
now that it's gone,

36:24.558 --> 36:27.345
Mara's full knowledge
is downloaded into Audrey?

36:27.436 --> 36:28.551
- It's a glitch.

36:29.563 --> 36:31.519
But if we can keep Audrey here
for a few more minutes,

36:31.607 --> 36:33.893
- then maybe--
- She'll do what Mara refuses to do.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.315
- Cure the Troubles.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.562
That's what
she's always wanted.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.324
(bells jingling)

36:41.408 --> 36:43.490
- What happened?
Are you all right?

36:43.577 --> 36:45.488
- Oh, I'm fine, Vince.

36:45.579 --> 36:47.115
And what happened is that
you and your brother

36:47.206 --> 36:48.662
are incredibly late.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.580
- Late for...?
- For counseling.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.282
Where have you been,
and where's Dave?

36:52.378 --> 36:54.835
- We already had
our session, Maddie, and...

36:54.922 --> 36:56.378
then you did solo work
with Dave.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.205
- That is absurd.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.291
- You just called me
five minutes ago

37:00.386 --> 37:02.126
terrified by something.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.552
Do you not remember?

37:04.556 --> 37:05.545
(phone beeps)

37:06.475 --> 37:09.091
- It says here that we spoke
for almost a minute.

37:09.186 --> 37:11.177
I don't remember that.
I don't remember the session.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.260
(bells jingle)

37:12.356 --> 37:13.687
- Sorry I'm late.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.981
Guess I lost track
of the time.

37:16.068 --> 37:18.400
- Shall we start?
- You too?

37:18.487 --> 37:19.943
- What?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.567
- You didn't lose track
of time, Dave.

37:22.658 --> 37:23.864
You lost time.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.282
(scoffs)
- Your brother says

37:25.369 --> 37:28.702
that we had our session and
that we've forgotten it.

37:28.789 --> 37:31.531
- Vince--
always the practical joker.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.082
- We were trying to access
that missing time, Da--

37:36.088 --> 37:38.044
Wait a minute.

37:38.132 --> 37:41.875
You two must have uncovered
something in your one-on-one...

37:41.969 --> 37:44.881
Something someone
doesn't want us to know about.

37:44.972 --> 37:46.837
- But who can steal time
like that?

37:46.932 --> 37:48.888
- Something very powerful.

37:48.976 --> 37:51.558
- Maddie, your pad--
you made notes.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.773
- Well, I'll be...

37:58.861 --> 37:59.850
We spoke...

38:01.029 --> 38:03.691
And then I induced
hypnotherapy in David,

38:03.782 --> 38:05.318
and then I stopped writing.

38:06.326 --> 38:07.827
- There's something
on the next page.

38:08.996 --> 38:10.577
- "Croatoan"?

38:10.664 --> 38:12.074
- Croatoan?

38:12.166 --> 38:13.246
- Is that even a word?

38:13.333 --> 38:16.996
J‘J‘

38:19.798 --> 38:22.005
- I told her that Audrey
was a hero for Troubled people.

38:22.092 --> 38:25.004
- You treated her like Audrey,
and Audrey came out.

38:26.013 --> 38:28.004
I didn't think
that would work for you.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.009
- Why not?
- Because it didn't work for Vickie.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.056
Vickie actually thought
she was Audrey,

38:32.144 --> 38:33.350
but no Audrey came out.

38:34.438 --> 38:36.724
lthoughtshe
just came out for me

38:36.815 --> 38:38.646
'cause she... loves me.

38:39.526 --> 38:43.769
And then when she came out
for you, I was fine with that.

38:43.864 --> 38:45.024
- So that's why
you were jealous.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.199
Wait.
Does that mean that you...

38:50.287 --> 38:52.994
- No. No, there's already
too many people there.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.039
I don't know why she came out
for me and not for Vickie.

38:56.126 --> 38:58.117
You were talking
about the Troubles.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.463
- Three things Audrey loves...

39:01.465 --> 39:03.547
me, you...

39:05.219 --> 39:06.709
helping people with Troubles.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.089
That's how we do it.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.637
- We throw everything
we got at her.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.215
J‘J‘

39:20.067 --> 39:21.603
- Hey, Parker.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.731
- HoW's it going, Audrey?

39:24.821 --> 39:25.810
- I never had a chance
to tell you

39:25.906 --> 39:27.487
about my daughter, detective.

39:27.574 --> 39:28.563
- What's going on?

39:28.659 --> 39:29.648
- Remember when we first looked

39:29.743 --> 39:31.483
at my grandfather's
journal together?

39:31.578 --> 39:33.694
- I remember that
first night we spent together.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.529
I don't know why I waited so long.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.740
- I was terrified
Lizzie got my Trouble.

39:38.752 --> 39:41.334
- She was only nine.
Mara: Body like gazelle...

39:41.421 --> 39:43.127
and face like a pooch.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.752
- She loved to sing
songs about cats.

39:45.842 --> 39:48.675
- When I first learned
about the Crocker family curse,

39:48.762 --> 39:50.047
you were there for me, Audrey.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.469
- And Vince almost caught us.

39:51.557 --> 39:54.515
- Sleeping with you was like
getting violated by a baboon.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.512
- I wouldn't trade that night
for my whole life.

39:56.603 --> 39:58.559
(laughs)
- The bullets went straight to her.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.597
I just wanted so
bad for them to kill me.

40:01.692 --> 40:03.603
- I wish they would have
killed you, too.

40:03.694 --> 40:05.525
I knew it had
to be you, not Lexie.

40:05.612 --> 40:06.852
I know you that well.

40:06.947 --> 40:08.528
- He knew before you.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.025
What does that say about you?

40:10.117 --> 40:12.608
- I was a mess,
'cause I thought I'd lost you.

40:12.703 --> 40:15.285
- You have lost her.
I'm Mara.

40:15.414 --> 40:17.120
- But now I know I haven't.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.456
Audrey's back.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.534
- Right.
- She doesn't need the chains.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.618
- Of course.
Sorry, detective.

40:25.299 --> 40:28.006
(clattering)

40:28.093 --> 40:30.049
- I'm gonna slit your throats.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.877
- Let's go back to the gull.
I'll buy you a drink.

40:31.972 --> 40:34.133
- That sounds great--
beer with old friends.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.509
- We're here for you, Audrey.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.466
- Parker,
I know you can hear me.

40:37.561 --> 40:40.018
- I'm sorry.
Did I name change?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.220
It's Mara.

40:41.315 --> 40:43.271
- We need you.
- We love you.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.894
- Go to hell!

40:45.986 --> 40:47.146
Don't touch me.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.738
- Don't touch me!
- Parker...

40:49.990 --> 40:51.821
I love you.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.410
I love you.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.483
(breathing heavily)

40:57.873 --> 40:59.659
(whispering)
Nathan, I love you too.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.701
- It's me.
- Hey.

41:04.796 --> 41:08.584
J‘J‘

41:08.675 --> 41:09.755
- It's me.
Nathan: Hey.

41:12.387 --> 41:14.093
- Can you maybe stick around
for a while this time?

41:14.181 --> 41:16.422
- I don't think that I can.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.848
Mara just found
out that I'm here.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.510
I can feel her.

41:21.605 --> 41:23.516
It's like she's dragging me
to the bottom of the ocean.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.268
- We're not gonna
let you drown.

41:25.359 --> 41:26.815
- I don't think I
have that much time.

41:26.902 --> 41:27.891
- So we have to work fast.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.487
You know everything
Mara knows, right?

41:29.571 --> 41:33.564
No. l-l can't seem to
remember before the cave.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.816
- How did you know about
the Scoville curse, then?

41:35.911 --> 41:38.823
- Because Mara was thinking
about it right at that moment.

41:40.499 --> 41:43.161
I have only access
to what she's thinking now.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.583
l-l don't know any of
her memories.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.161
- So you can't
cure the Troubles?

41:47.255 --> 41:50.543
- No, Dwight, I don't think I can.

41:50.634 --> 41:51.965
- But Mara can, right?

41:52.052 --> 41:53.917
- No, she's been lying to you.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.253
She can't take the Troubles
out of people.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.884
She can only put them in.

41:59.768 --> 42:00.803
- No cure.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.230
- Nathan, please.
- I'm right here.

42:04.314 --> 42:07.306
- Nathan... Nathan
- Stay here. Stay with me.

42:07.401 --> 42:09.062
- Please.
- Stay-- look at me.

42:09.152 --> 42:10.813
- Please.

42:11.905 --> 42:12.894
Damn all of you!

42:12.989 --> 42:14.240
(thuds)

42:14.324 --> 42:15.313
(panting)

42:16.743 --> 42:19.075
- Mara.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.744
- So Audrey was rattling
around inside of me.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.084
Thank you
for letting me know.

42:27.003 --> 42:29.335
I'm going to kill that bitch
right now.

42:30.924 --> 42:31.913
(sighs)

42:33.135 --> 42:35.922
J‘J‘

42:38.223 --> 42:42.262
