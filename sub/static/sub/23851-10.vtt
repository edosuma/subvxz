00:38.880 --> 00:40.280
Mom?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.800
All grown up and going to prom.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.238
But your...

00:47.240 --> 00:48.920
Little incident?

00:53.560 --> 00:55.878
You know I did that for you, right?

00:55.880 --> 00:57.480
You know that, right?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.640
I gave you a gift that day.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.280
Today's the day that you unwrap it.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.558
<i>Dear Diary,</i>

02:06.560 --> 02:09.478
<i>yesterday's lunchtime poll asked,</i>

02:09.479 --> 02:13.120
<i>"Who at Westerburg</i>
<i>will you remember most?"</i>

02:15.480 --> 02:18.398
<i>I want to believe the answer is</i>
<i>none of these people.</i>

02:18.400 --> 02:21.280
<i>But we all know that's not true.</i>

02:22.240 --> 02:25.158
<i>Even if I never see any of them again,</i>

02:25.160 --> 02:28.960
<i>they'll all be</i>
<i>burned into my brain... forever.</i>

02:30.360 --> 02:33.518
<i>Why is high school such a big deal?</i>

02:33.520 --> 02:35.118
<i>It's just four years.</i>

02:35.120 --> 02:37.120
<i>Why is it different</i>
<i>than any other four years?</i>

02:38.200 --> 02:40.158
<i>Ms. Fleming says it's because</i>

02:40.160 --> 02:42.200
<i>high school is when we decide</i>

02:42.960 --> 02:44.640
<i>who we are.</i>

02:48.280 --> 02:49.600
<i>Are we the jock?</i>

02:52.000 --> 02:53.640
<i>The nerd?</i>

02:56.560 --> 02:57.960
<i>The queen?</i>

03:00.520 --> 03:03.838
<i>Whatever our choice,</i>
<i>we'd better make it quick.</i>

03:03.840 --> 03:05.520
<i>Because soon it will be too late.</i>

03:06.400 --> 03:08.240
<i>The ink is slowly drying.</i>

03:09.040 --> 03:11.118
<i>The camera will flash.</i>

03:11.120 --> 03:12.800
<i>The photo will be taken.</i>

03:16.680 --> 03:18.000
<i>And then that's it.</i>

03:21.080 --> 03:23.598
<i>That's our last chance because</i>

03:23.600 --> 03:26.278
<i>no matter what we do in the future,</i>

03:26.280 --> 03:27.920
<i>we will be frozen</i>

03:28.880 --> 03:30.440
<i>in these poses...</i>

03:31.360 --> 03:32.760
<i>forever.</i>

03:40.080 --> 03:42.838
-That skirt length is wrong.
-I measured at home.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.920
Oh, no, honey,
I meant for your body type.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.678
Enjoy your night, Driffany.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.880
Most of us is still standing.
Let's go! Let's get in the mix!

03:52.680 --> 03:54.838
Everyone's saying when they crown
Heather Chandler prom queen

03:54.840 --> 03:56.958
she's gonna come out to <i> Amazing Grace.</i>

03:56.960 --> 03:59.840
I love her. She had my favorite
attempted suicide this year.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.998
Just do it.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.318
What's the worst that could happen?

04:24.320 --> 04:25.720
She could say no.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.240
Well, she'd be missing out
on a really great guy.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.040
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna go for it.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.118
-Hey, hey.
-Hi.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.038
I saw your dancing, it's really cool.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.598
So, I was wondering,
you want to dance with me?

04:45.600 --> 04:48.118
Oh, Dylen. You're sweet and all
but I kind of have a thing going

04:48.120 --> 04:49.560
with these three guys.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.360
My thighs, isn't it?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.720
Screw it.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.600
I knew you'd make it, my dear.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.880
What are you doing?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.680
What am I doing?

05:43.880 --> 05:46.200
I'm about to save Westerburg.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.318
When that little timer goes off

05:56.320 --> 05:58.118
it sends a spark,

05:58.120 --> 06:01.358
setting off the fireworks
in the cafeteria ceiling.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.638
And when those
hit my special balloons...

06:04.640 --> 06:05.960
Boom.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.160
Good night, Westerburg.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.920
So, this is your big plan?

06:13.360 --> 06:15.120
You're an asshole, JD.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.958
Babe.
You know that old moral conundrum.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.998
If you could go back in time
and kill teenage Hitler, would you?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.718
Hitler? JD, what are you talking about?

06:26.720 --> 06:30.158
Nobody up there deserves to die.
They're all goddamn kids!

06:30.160 --> 06:31.638
Now they are.

06:31.640 --> 06:36.398
But soon they'll be doctors and lawyers
and captains of industry.

06:36.400 --> 06:41.158
<i>And the virus their parents infected</i>
<i>them with in the form of good schools</i>

06:41.160 --> 06:46.398
<i>and shiny new BMW's will spread</i>
<i>and spread and keep spreading</i>

06:46.400 --> 06:50.358
<i>until it smothers the remaining good</i>
<i>left in this world.</i>

06:50.360 --> 06:53.838
And so, a mass suicide

06:53.840 --> 06:58.518
will finally be the thing
that wakes people up

06:58.520 --> 07:04.998
from their chain store, mega-church,
Wi-Fi, TV-induced slumber.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.678
How is blowing up a bunch of teenagers
supposed to change anything, you psycho?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.040
God, babe.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.680
Don't you get it, Veronica?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.398
Society nods its head at any horror

07:21.400 --> 07:24.558
the American teenager
can bring upon itself.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.118
Our country acts like we don't want
any more tragedies

07:28.120 --> 07:30.598
and yet, shock of shocks,

07:30.600 --> 07:32.200
they keep happening.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.520
Why?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.320
Because we want them to.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.000
We want the tragedy.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.638
We want the death.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.000
I mean...

07:45.280 --> 07:48.878
a guy walked into a kindergarten

07:48.880 --> 07:51.280
and picked off 20 kids.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.560
Elementary school students.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.840
And what did the land of the free
and the home of the brave do then?

08:04.120 --> 08:05.440
Nothing.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.558
Because we're Americans.

08:08.560 --> 08:13.158
And violence is just who we are.
We drink it.

08:13.160 --> 08:18.718
No matter how hard we land on our
fainting couches every time it happens.

08:18.720 --> 08:22.238
We fucking live for it.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.998
But if killing kids
doesn't move the needle,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.920
then maybe the kids
killing themselves will.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.357
In 15 minutes,

08:33.360 --> 08:36.918
the tragedy of Westerburg High

08:36.919 --> 08:40.760
is going to bring an end
to American violence.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.120
And you really believe that.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.400
Don't you?

09:02.440 --> 09:05.240
You and I both know the truth, Veronica.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.718
<i>I hear in heaven, you can eat</i>
<i>as much as you want.</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:16.238
<i>-I want to die.</i>
<i>-It's not fair.</i>

09:16.240 --> 09:19.398
<i>All the cool kids are in heaven</i>
<i>and we're stuck here.</i>

09:19.400 --> 09:22.040
<i>All my friends are in heaven</i>
<i>and I just want to join them.</i>

09:24.280 --> 09:25.640
Those kids up there,

09:26.840 --> 09:29.240
the students of Westerburg.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.680
They're already sentenced to
a lifetime of meaninglessness.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.838
They're going to grow old,

09:40.840 --> 09:42.478
get fat,

09:42.480 --> 09:44.600
and spend their whole lives

09:45.520 --> 09:47.718
comatose on the couch.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.198
Watching an episode of <i> House Hunters</i>
on HGTV

09:51.200 --> 09:54.120
they've already seen three times.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.640
They're already gone.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.360
But we can give their lives meaning.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.600
We can help them.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.760
No one else.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.000
So, what do you say?

10:17.240 --> 10:18.920
Grow up, JD.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.078
Babe, where are you going?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.838
I'm turning you in.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.278
You piece of shit.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.760
Westerburg,
let's burn this dance floor down!

10:36.120 --> 10:38.878
Veronica,
why are you wearing red to prom?

10:38.880 --> 10:42.038
-What? Who cares?
-I care. I told you to wear silver.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.798
-Not now, Heather.
-Heather Duke

10:43.800 --> 10:46.160
would never
wear my color to prom.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.678
What did you say about Heather?

10:48.680 --> 10:52.598
I said she would have been smart enough
to stay in her lane.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.078
God.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.038
Why do the good ones always have to die

10:56.040 --> 10:58.600
and the boring, worthless ones
are left alive?

11:00.640 --> 11:02.838
God, why are you such a mega-bitch?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.718
Because I have to be.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.558
Because you have to be?

11:06.560 --> 11:10.678
Heather, there are more important things
right now than your teenage bullshit.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.118
You saw what happened when I was gone.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.200
Westerburg fell apart.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.358
These people need me, Veronica.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.518
They all want to fuck with the eagles
and guess what?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.438
I teach them how to fly.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.798
-Let go of me, Heather!
-You know the best part, Veronica?

11:26.800 --> 11:31.440
Unlike you, they'll never forget me.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.558
I don't care if Dylen Lutz
becomes President

11:35.560 --> 11:38.438
or if Driffany Tompkins cures cancer.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.558
No matter where they go,
no matter what they do,

11:41.560 --> 11:43.918
no matter how high they fly,

11:43.920 --> 11:46.318
there will always be
a small part of them

11:46.320 --> 11:49.878
that worships at the altar
of Heather Chandler.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.798
You think too highly
of yourself, Heather.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.760
I seem to recall that I got so
in your head that you tried to kill me.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.678
Doesn't get more influential than that,
does it, Veronica?

12:01.680 --> 12:06.640
I made you so angry
that you wanted me dead.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.840
I revel in that every day.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.398
And Heather M?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.440
She spent her entire life
longing for my approval.

12:17.560 --> 12:21.720
And in the end when she couldn't cut it,
what was her final swan song?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.480
She copied me.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.840
And you two were the most popular kids
in school.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.960
Just imagine what these green
text messages are capable of.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.680
I'm already inside
everyone at Westerburg.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.080
Like a virus.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.318
Call it what you want.

12:44.320 --> 12:48.240
But you and I both know that
every moment of every day,

12:49.120 --> 12:50.998
every important decision,

12:51.000 --> 12:55.118
every relationship,
every moral choice they ever make,

12:55.120 --> 12:59.518
I will be there,
permanently in their heads

12:59.520 --> 13:04.318
guiding them towards the truth that is
the Heather Chandler way.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.478
And then their kids and their kids,

13:07.480 --> 13:10.518
and on and on and on and on.

13:10.520 --> 13:14.120
Because that is what power is, Veronica.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.280
Even after you and I are both long gone.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.998
I will live on forever.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.438
Pulling the trigger on every decision

13:24.440 --> 13:29.160
in their sad, lonely, pathetic lives.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.440
Still beautiful, Heather.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.000
Well, at least I'm not nothing.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.960
Like you.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.478
<i>Dear Cruel World.</i>

13:48.480 --> 13:50.518
<i>The slut table is over there.</i>

13:50.520 --> 13:52.518
<i>Everyone thinks I have it so great.</i>

13:52.520 --> 13:54.998
<i>I still think Heather Chandler's suicide</i>
<i>was better.</i>

13:55.000 --> 13:56.878
<i>Heather M's felt forced.</i>

13:56.880 --> 13:58.358
<i>I'm worthless.</i>

13:58.360 --> 14:01.278
<i>Heather Chandler killing herself is the</i>
<i>best thing that's ever happened to us.</i>

14:01.280 --> 14:03.118
<i>Because I'm nothing.</i>

14:03.120 --> 14:05.918
<i>-She's obsessed with us.</i>
<i>-Of course she is, Heather.</i>

14:05.920 --> 14:08.440
<i>We're the only thing</i>
<i>that makes her interesting.</i>

14:13.720 --> 14:17.200
Find me in ten minutes and then tell me
if I'm nothing, bitch.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.120
Babe.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.960
JD.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.998
You're a murderer.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.118
And a sociopath.

14:44.120 --> 14:50.118
And you see the absolute worst
in humanity.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.560
And you know what?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.320
You're right.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.280
The whole world

15:00.720 --> 15:03.120
is going to remember
Westerburg High School.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.598
We're gonna be the first people

15:08.600 --> 15:11.320
to finally
do some goddamn good in this town.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.998
Wait.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.880
We still have 11 minutes.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.760
Time for one last high school ritual.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.320
A dance, Ms. Sawyer.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.158
All right, y'all.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.158
This next one goes out to all the good
kids at Westerburg we lost this year.

15:36.160 --> 15:40.480
So, let's get up on the dance floor
and show them how much we miss them.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.398
So, like, Heather McNamara gone.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.718
Kurt, Ram gone.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.278
Right.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.358
Heather Duke now, right?

16:47.360 --> 16:49.318
Did Heather Chandler die?

16:49.320 --> 16:52.078
No, that was--
She didn't, she's good.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.400
Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.558
Dude.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.080
Holy shit.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.838
Was that Betty Finn?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.720
Was that necessary?

17:29.920 --> 17:32.560
Oh, my God.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.118
Betty, you look hot.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.878
-Oh, that hair.
-I need those boots.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.238
-Where's JD?
-JD?

17:50.240 --> 17:52.678
I have spent every moment
of military school

17:52.680 --> 17:55.358
thinking about what I'm going to do
to that sick freak.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.640
But, Betty, with this new look
you can do way better than him.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.160
Betty Finn.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.360
Oh, my God. You look amazing.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.878
This?
I mean... It's not too much?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.798
Too much? This is the first time
I've ever looked at you

18:16.800 --> 18:18.678
and not been jealous of a blind person.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.278
Thank you. You really like it?

18:21.280 --> 18:25.278
Buck up, Betty. With this
new militia moment you're rocking,

18:25.280 --> 18:29.718
everyone at Westerburg is either gonna
want you for a friend or a fuck.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.040
Come on.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.078
Okay. Ready to do some good?

18:50.080 --> 18:51.520
I'm ready.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.960
Did you hear?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.998
Some loser freak just attacked
Jefferson High's prom

19:00.000 --> 19:02.080
and they're saying it's the biggest
school shooting ever.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.678
Shit.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.598
-What do you mean "shit"?
-Did you hear?

19:10.600 --> 19:12.158
What are you doing, JD?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.638
What am I doing?
We have to stop the plan.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.158
-What?
-Don't you get it, Veronica?

19:15.160 --> 19:16.638
If we do it,
we'll be like Farrah Fawcett

19:16.640 --> 19:18.158
dying on the same day
as Michael Jackson.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.038
No one will care.
Some B-list little punk just ruined

19:21.040 --> 19:23.718
the one shot the world had
at true redemption.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.798
Listen to me, JD, I thought that this
was about us?

19:26.800 --> 19:29.678
I thought that this was about
doing some good.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.520
Veronica, focus,
because we don't have a lot of time.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.918
You're just like them, aren't you?

19:35.920 --> 19:37.520
Oh, Veronica.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.358
You're not a rebel, JD.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.038
And you're not a hero.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.198
You know what you are?

19:45.200 --> 19:46.678
You're a Heather.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.398
All you care about
is how people see you.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.038
All you care about is optics.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.038
Just like them. No, I take that back.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.358
You're worse than a Heather, JD.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.480
Because at least the Heathers
would admit it.

20:07.520 --> 20:11.120
Great idea to put guns in schools,
teachers.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.360
Really saved me the hassle of having
to go through the metal detector.

20:17.880 --> 20:23.360
You know, I really thought
you could handle me, Veronica.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.840
But you are
just another high school girl.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.638
Move.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.478
You know, I have a speech prepared
for guys like you.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.360
But you don't even deserve
my goddamn speech.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.798
What do I deserve, babe?

20:42.800 --> 20:44.680
To rot in hell.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.600
Fuck it.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.078
Damn.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.918
Not even a warning shot?

21:27.920 --> 21:30.840
Our whole relationship
was a warning shot.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.998
Restart the timer.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.358
No, think about this, Veronica, okay?
So, the timer goes off,

21:39.360 --> 21:41.638
the balloons rain hell down
from the cafeteria ceiling

21:41.640 --> 21:44.918
and then what?
That's how it ends now?

21:44.920 --> 21:47.078
Sure, we off the whole school,
we offed Heather Chandler.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.838
But what good did it do, okay?
There are Heathers everywhere,

21:49.840 --> 21:52.600
in every town, every school,
every country in the world.

21:58.200 --> 22:02.558
You think you talked me into this,
so now you can talk me out of it?

22:02.560 --> 22:04.040
You know what, JD?

22:05.240 --> 22:08.078
I'm tired of being talked at.

22:08.080 --> 22:12.358
My entire life I've always had
someone talking at me,

22:12.360 --> 22:17.800
telling me what I'm supposed to think
and feel and do.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.158
My parents.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.038
Little dead Lucy.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.760
Heather Chandler.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.760
And now you.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.478
What gives you the right
to decide the conversation?

22:34.480 --> 22:38.598
Westerburg is going down

22:38.600 --> 22:41.360
with or without you.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.440
And now, it will be my choice.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.720
Shit!

23:01.880 --> 23:04.800
I was gonna return this dress, JD.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.000
I'm sorry, Veronica. I--

23:18.800 --> 23:20.918
I didn't want it to be this way, okay?

23:20.920 --> 23:25.398
You were my equal, but in order for me
to have the impact I needed,

23:25.400 --> 23:27.520
in order for society to feel...

23:31.920 --> 23:34.278
Blah, blah, blah.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.278
Society.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.598
Blah, blah, blah, corporations.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.160
Will you shut the hell up for once?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.120
We had it all, JD.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.400
We had it all.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.878
And you threw it all away
to be a statistic

23:52.880 --> 23:56.678
in a full-of-shit effing magazine.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.000
Babe.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.360
That really hurt.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.400
Is this the prom night you imagined?

24:13.280 --> 24:14.600
I mean...

24:15.760 --> 24:17.238
No.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.600
But...

24:19.560 --> 24:21.000
yeah.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.600
We had...

24:29.480 --> 24:31.560
We had fun while it lasted.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.280
One last kiss?

25:02.080 --> 25:03.720
Our love is God.

25:05.440 --> 25:08.520
Our love was God.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.158
<i>I hear in heaven you can eat</i>
<i>as much as you want.</i>

25:42.160 --> 25:43.560
<i>I want to die.</i>

25:50.000 --> 25:51.360
I guess...

25:52.680 --> 25:54.560
that Veronica Sawyer...

25:55.600 --> 25:59.560
is no longer... nothing.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.078
-Hey, where are the teachers?
-Didn't you hear?

26:28.080 --> 26:29.878
Heather Chandler
did a mid-prom costume change

26:29.880 --> 26:32.598
and Ms. Fleming told her to leave
because her skirt was too short.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.720
You need to get out of here.
Save yourself.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.118
-Okay.
-I get what's happening here.

26:42.120 --> 26:46.118
Principal Gowan,
this skirt is from Japan.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.278
See, Pauline, they're just
a smaller people.

26:48.280 --> 26:51.558
So that right there is clothing?

26:51.560 --> 26:53.278
-Well, it's because--
-Excuse me, excuse me!

26:53.280 --> 26:55.878
-Not now, Dylen.
-Heather, I'm trying to protect you.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.838
I don't think Heather needs protection.
She's terrifying.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.318
-Thank you.
-We have a problem!

26:59.320 --> 27:01.198
Dylen, not now!
Please, this is important.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.758
Excuse me, the rule is two inches
from the center of the knee.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.238
Obviously, you don't teach math.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.558
-Excuse me!
-Okay, now I'm feeling very violated

27:07.560 --> 27:09.198
in addition to being slut-shamed.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.238
-Please do not violate the students.
-The ruler was doing the violating.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.398
Everyone, shut up!

27:14.400 --> 27:16.398
I just saw Veronica Sawyer
go into the boiler room.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.878
I followed her down there
and she and that weird guy JD

27:18.880 --> 27:20.638
shot each other with guns.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.558
They said they were gonna
blow up the school.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.638
It's rigged, it's rigged! All of it,
the balloons, there's a timer.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.638
We gotta get everybody
out of the cafeteria right now

27:27.640 --> 27:30.240
or we're all gonna be dead as fuck!

27:33.640 --> 27:36.118
Language like that is unacceptable,
young man.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.158
Dylen, we're dealing
with a serious issue

27:38.160 --> 27:40.838
and do not need to be interrupted
by your coke rants.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.158
We have to find out where
these kids are getting the drugs.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.918
Well, clearly from Japan.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.838
Please, do something.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.918
You guys are the adults.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.998
-Dylen, go back into prom.
-No, please.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.238
-These kids are out of control.
-Heather, your skirt is too short.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.600
You have to leave prom.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.518
Screw you.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.998
Screw who?

28:00.000 --> 28:03.080
-Who did she say "screw you" to?
-I think she's on drugs too. Heather!

28:04.320 --> 28:06.838
Westerburg High, are you ready

28:06.840 --> 28:10.720
to find out who your Prom Queen is?

28:13.200 --> 28:16.118
-We'll find out on my count.
-Heather, what kind of drugs are you on?

28:16.120 --> 28:19.878
Westerburg will pay for this.
I'm supposed to be crowned Prom Queen

28:19.880 --> 28:21.958
and I'm not even
allowed to go back inside?

28:21.960 --> 28:25.438
-Ten!
-Let me tell you something, teachers.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.558
Go back to your Sunday school.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.998
Go back to your community college.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.838
-Go back to your condo.
-Four!

28:33.840 --> 28:35.998
Because when
my wrath comes down on you...

28:36.000 --> 28:37.558
Three!

28:37.560 --> 28:43.038
...you will feel it
like the force of a thousand suns.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.000
They will rain down and I prom--

29:31.040 --> 29:33.998
I just wish there'd been a sign.
A warning.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.198
-Anything so we could have stopped this.
-Well, I did my part.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.758
I wrote a musical.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.318
-I don't know about the rest of you.
-Excuse me, I held an assembly.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.678
Well, don't look at me.
I said we should have a bake sale,

29:43.680 --> 29:45.158
and you all shot me down.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.358
Let's not beat ourselves up. There's no
sense being Monday morning quarterbacks.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.918
It's not our fault.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.198
Sometimes there are just crazy
lone wolves in the world.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.278
And sometimes there's not just
one lone wolf.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.878
Sometimes there are whole groups
of lone wolves

29:57.880 --> 29:59.758
that decide to commit mass suicide.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.080
We tried everything we possibly could.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.118
Are we sure?

30:05.120 --> 30:07.558
Something's just not adding up.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.558
How so?

30:09.560 --> 30:11.160
I don't know.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.798
Maybe we should have
listened to the kids?

30:14.800 --> 30:18.198
-When?
-Well, just now with Dylen.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.878
The one screaming.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.118
About the balloons or something.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.078
-What was he saying again?
-You mean that drug addict?

30:25.080 --> 30:26.678
I tuned him right out.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.760
Hold on. Maybe Coach is onto something.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.640
Could he have been trying to warn us?

30:34.760 --> 30:36.440
Actually...

30:37.640 --> 30:39.878
Do you think that maybe

30:39.880 --> 30:43.840
we could have paid more attention
to all of these kids?

30:54.120 --> 30:56.800
-Well, I guess we'll never know now.
-Yeah.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.880
Drinks?

31:15.360 --> 31:16.680
I'm fine.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.318
Channel 17 news.

31:43.320 --> 31:47.078
Can I interview you about
the Westerburg High tragedy?

31:47.080 --> 31:49.360
You seem to be the only survivor.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.320
Of course.

31:57.800 --> 32:02.758
Which is why I'm calling my new
campaign, "I Am Mass Suicide."

32:02.760 --> 32:06.478
Now tell us, survivor, we're getting
reports that the mastermind

32:06.480 --> 32:10.920
behind the mass suicide was a student
named Veronica Sawyer.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.800
Well, I really think
we should be focusing on the victims.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.478
-Thank you.
-Shouldn't we get her name?

32:21.480 --> 32:23.878
No, we'll just call her a friend
of Veronica Sawyer.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.240
<i>Friend of Veronica Sawyer.</i>

32:26.600 --> 32:28.478
<i>Friend of Veronica Sawyer.</i>

32:28.480 --> 32:30.280
<i>This girl is nothing.</i>

34:25.199 --> 34:27.880
-You look great tonight.
-Thank you.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.838
Seth, remember
when you left the stove on

34:31.840 --> 34:33.638
and all your brothers and sisters died?

34:33.639 --> 34:35.717
They're here, and they're hot now!

34:35.719 --> 34:37.159
-Cool!
-Yeah.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.518
Do you want to dance?

34:43.520 --> 34:45.040
I thought you'd never ask.

34:56.440 --> 34:57.760
May I cut in?

35:02.920 --> 35:04.798
God, Heather.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.920
Why were we so mean to each other
down there?

35:07.840 --> 35:09.358
I don't know, Heather.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.400
Maybe because being mean
was easier than being afraid?

35:14.760 --> 35:16.080
Have you seen Veronica?

35:19.640 --> 35:22.360
-Let's dance.
-Gladly.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.840
Betty.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.200
Betty.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.960
Heather.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.760
Heather.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.998
You guys, it's...

36:34.000 --> 36:35.440
It's me.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.480
Veronica?

36:57.800 --> 36:59.120
Veronica?

37:02.840 --> 37:04.160
Veronica?

37:13.720 --> 37:15.360
Veronica?

37:16.760 --> 37:18.200
JD?

37:25.120 --> 37:26.560
Veronica?

37:40.240 --> 37:41.560
JD?

37:49.640 --> 37:51.238
No, no.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.078
No, please.
Please, let me in.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.518
Please, let me back in.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.040
Heather, Heather, please.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.678
Please, Heather.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.838
Please.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.158
Please, Heather!

38:08.160 --> 38:09.480
Heather!
