WEBVTT

00:00.433 --> 00:03.101
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> when calls the heart...

00:03.103 --> 00:04.435
Let me drive.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.336
Can't believe
I'm about to agree to this.

00:06.338 --> 00:08.838
[yelps and laughs
as engine fires up]

00:08.840 --> 00:10.773
Rosemary leveaux, I promise,
you will get your theater.

00:10.775 --> 00:12.040
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

00:12.042 --> 00:13.107
[â™ª]

00:13.109 --> 00:14.341
Is that
charles kensington

00:14.343 --> 00:16.109
Elizabeth
just kissed?

00:16.111 --> 00:17.443
Yep.

00:19.179 --> 00:21.914
[â™ª]

00:25.018 --> 00:26.518
[frank]: Another project?

00:26.520 --> 00:28.520
The paint's still wet
on the school house.

00:28.522 --> 00:30.054
[lee]: I know, I know.

00:30.056 --> 00:33.090
But think of the prestige
it'll bring to hope valley.

00:33.092 --> 00:36.126
Plays. Concerts. Recitals.

00:36.128 --> 00:38.394
This town could use
a little culture.

00:38.396 --> 00:39.561
Don't you agree, abigail?

00:39.563 --> 00:40.862
I'm sure I would,

00:40.864 --> 00:42.296
If I had any idea
what you were talking about.

00:42.298 --> 00:43.597
Well, lee here

00:43.599 --> 00:45.532
Has promised to build
a theater for rosemary.

00:45.534 --> 00:47.267
-So I've heard.
-Really?

00:47.269 --> 00:48.868
Word spreads
fast in this town.

00:48.870 --> 00:50.202
Word spreads fast

00:50.204 --> 00:51.570
When rosemary
is spreading it.

00:51.572 --> 00:53.071
Ah, but that's
the beauty of it.

00:53.073 --> 00:55.640
Not only is she the performer,
she also does her own publicity.

00:55.642 --> 00:57.575
And she's got the newspaper
behind her, too.

00:57.577 --> 00:58.609
I can see she's got
you convinced.

00:58.611 --> 01:01.578
That woman could sell ice
in a snowstorm.

01:01.580 --> 01:03.379
[laughing]

01:03.381 --> 01:05.814
[â™ª]

01:07.216 --> 01:09.083
Well, if you'll excuse me,

01:09.085 --> 01:10.617
I've got to
get back to the cafe.

01:10.619 --> 01:12.151
Of course.

01:12.153 --> 01:15.220
Shall we?

01:15.222 --> 01:17.722
[â™ª]

01:30.401 --> 01:33.002
Heat makes mercury rise

01:33.004 --> 01:35.738
But, because it's sealed
in this glass tube,

01:35.740 --> 01:38.340
All it can do
is go up,

01:38.342 --> 01:40.475
And we can tell
what the temperature is

01:40.477 --> 01:44.812
By seeing just how high
the mercury gets.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.346
How high is it,
miss thatcher?

01:46.348 --> 01:49.048
[sighs] it's colder than
any classroom ought to be.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.084
I think I can
help with that.

01:53.286 --> 01:55.587
You know how to fix a stove?

01:55.589 --> 01:59.123
Well, I may not be an expert,
but I think I can manage.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.424
Mounties can do anything.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.327
Give that young man an "a."

02:04.329 --> 02:06.696
[chuckles]
all right, everyone.

02:06.698 --> 02:08.364
Please take out
your grammar books.

02:08.366 --> 02:09.531
Yes, emily?

02:09.533 --> 02:12.634
Are you gonna marry
constable thornton?

02:12.636 --> 02:14.335
[â™ª]

02:14.337 --> 02:15.502
Emily...

02:15.504 --> 02:18.004
We are working on
our grammar now.

02:18.006 --> 02:19.138
My mom says
that she's gonna

02:19.140 --> 02:20.339
Marry the man
from hamilton...

02:20.341 --> 02:22.207
The one she kissed

02:22.209 --> 02:24.042
Before he got
on the stagecoach.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.677
Albert...
Your grammar book?

02:26.679 --> 02:29.479
Now, if you'll all please
turn to page 35--

02:29.481 --> 02:30.713
Is he coming back,

02:30.715 --> 02:31.780
Miss thatcher?

02:31.782 --> 02:32.781
Or are you
gonna marry him

02:32.783 --> 02:34.716
And move
to hamilton?

02:34.718 --> 02:37.218
[dreamily]:
He's very handsome.

02:37.220 --> 02:38.819
All right, children!

02:38.821 --> 02:40.687
I'm not marrying anyone.

02:40.689 --> 02:41.888
Ever?

02:41.890 --> 02:44.357
Maybe... Someday.

02:44.359 --> 02:46.359
But not right away.

02:46.361 --> 02:48.661
And certainly not
until you've all learned

02:48.663 --> 02:50.362
How to properly
diagram a sentence,

02:50.364 --> 02:52.330
So unless you would like
extra homework,

02:52.332 --> 02:55.566
I suggest that you all focus
on your propositions.

02:55.568 --> 02:56.800
[kids giggling]

02:56.802 --> 02:59.169
I mean prepositions.

02:59.171 --> 03:01.571
Page 35, please.

03:01.573 --> 03:03.172
In your books.

03:03.174 --> 03:04.640
We will all read aloud.

03:08.011 --> 03:10.412
[â™ª]

03:29.197 --> 03:30.897
[elizabeth]: And after
jack fixed the stove,

03:30.899 --> 03:32.765
Rachel said, "thank you

03:32.767 --> 03:35.367
For keeping miss thatcher
nice and warm."

03:35.369 --> 03:36.668
[abigail laughs]

03:36.670 --> 03:38.102
What did jack say?

03:38.104 --> 03:39.770
Nothing.
What'd you expect him to say?

03:39.772 --> 03:41.571
"my pleasure."

03:41.573 --> 03:44.340
Now, that sounds like something
more charles would say.

03:44.342 --> 03:46.942
Somehow I can't imagine
charles repairing a stove.

03:46.944 --> 03:48.543
Can you imagine him
keeping you warm?

03:48.545 --> 03:49.677
Abigail!

03:49.679 --> 03:51.545
I'm just asking.

03:51.547 --> 03:54.681
So many suitors,
so many choices.

03:54.683 --> 03:56.549
I think we've talked enough
about my suitors.

03:56.551 --> 03:57.550
It's far more fun

03:57.552 --> 03:59.952
Than discussing mine.

03:59.954 --> 04:02.688
We don't have to talk
about bill avery either.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.256
Good.

04:04.258 --> 04:06.091
The sooner I put that behind me,
the better.

04:06.093 --> 04:07.358
I know.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.728
You'd only just opened
up your heart again.

04:10.730 --> 04:11.929
I wish I had
great words of wisdom,

04:11.931 --> 04:14.398
But all I can do
is try to be a good listener.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.799
That's all you have to be.

04:18.368 --> 04:20.535
[â™ª]

04:24.039 --> 04:26.473
Right on time.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.640
Mm-hmm.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.074
What do you want
to talk to me about?

04:29.076 --> 04:30.909
Care for a drink?

04:30.911 --> 04:32.143
No, thank you.

04:32.145 --> 04:33.711
Suit yourself.

04:33.713 --> 04:35.713
I thought
we might discuss

04:35.715 --> 04:37.815
The new
railroad line.

04:37.817 --> 04:39.049
Ah...

04:39.051 --> 04:40.617
The railroad line.

04:40.619 --> 04:43.052
The one that was gonna
go right to my sawmill,

04:43.054 --> 04:44.987
And that you somehow
convinced the railroad company

04:44.989 --> 04:46.955
To reroute through
land you own?

04:46.957 --> 04:49.157
The new route
is better for the town.

04:49.159 --> 04:51.392
Tell me. How does
building a spur line

04:51.394 --> 04:54.261
Further away from the town
benefit anyone?

04:54.263 --> 04:56.896
Well, it gives room for
hope valley to expand.

04:56.898 --> 04:59.265
Again... Onto land you own.

04:59.267 --> 05:01.634
How convenient.

05:01.636 --> 05:03.402
Well, we will all
share in the benefits,

05:03.404 --> 05:06.104
Just as we will all share
in the costs.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.473
The costs? What costs?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.575
Well, the roadways
and the depot

05:10.577 --> 05:12.243
Are not the responsibility
of the railway,

05:12.245 --> 05:13.410
They're our responsibility.

05:13.412 --> 05:14.411
Let me guess.

05:14.413 --> 05:15.945
You have a plan.

05:15.947 --> 05:17.279
I am the mayor.

05:17.281 --> 05:19.247
Uh-huh.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.818
A "special business
tax assessment"?

05:24.820 --> 05:27.821
Those who'll reap
the most benefit

05:27.823 --> 05:31.191
Will also share
the most of the burden.

05:31.193 --> 05:32.759
The way you've
rigged these rates,

05:32.761 --> 05:34.694
You're gonna break me.

05:36.463 --> 05:39.131
That is the idea, of course,
though, isn't it?

05:39.133 --> 05:41.633
Stealing the rail-line from me,
that wasn't enough for you.

05:41.635 --> 05:42.867
You're not gonna be happy

05:42.869 --> 05:44.268
Until you put me
out of business for good,

05:44.270 --> 05:45.469
Is that right?

05:45.471 --> 05:46.937
Fair is fair.

05:46.939 --> 05:49.139
You wouldn't know the first
thing about being fair.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.173
This is not it.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.841
I'm going to fight you on this.

05:51.843 --> 05:53.342
Well, you can try.

05:53.344 --> 05:56.445
But the town council
has already approved it.

05:56.447 --> 05:58.780
[â™ª]

06:10.225 --> 06:12.793
Jack? Jack!

06:14.328 --> 06:16.495
I just got this telegram
from viola--

06:16.497 --> 06:18.063
I just got one
from the mounties.

06:18.065 --> 06:20.899
Tom and julie were in
an automobile accident.

06:20.901 --> 06:22.567
Viola says that julie
will be all right.

06:22.569 --> 06:23.901
How bad is tom?

06:23.903 --> 06:25.302
Didn't say.

06:25.304 --> 06:26.403
You're going?

06:26.405 --> 06:28.405
The first stage
I can catch. You?

06:28.407 --> 06:29.572
I don't have
much of a choice.

06:29.574 --> 06:30.706
According to viola,

06:30.708 --> 06:32.007
My parents have
never been this upset,

06:32.009 --> 06:33.708
And julie won't
speak to anyone.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.676
What about school?

06:35.678 --> 06:37.844
[sighs heavily]

06:37.846 --> 06:39.679
[rachel]:
Why do you have to go?

06:39.681 --> 06:41.347
[elizabeth]:
My family needs me,

06:41.349 --> 06:43.182
But I'll be back
as soon as I can.

06:43.184 --> 06:44.583
And while I'm gone,

06:44.585 --> 06:47.419
Mrs. Blakeley will be
your substitute teacher.

06:47.421 --> 06:48.520
[all groaning]

06:48.522 --> 06:50.388
Mrs. Blakeley?

06:50.390 --> 06:52.356
Yes, and I expect you all
to listen to her

06:52.358 --> 06:53.890
And do as she says.

06:53.892 --> 06:56.025
I'll be leaving lessons
in geography,

06:56.027 --> 06:57.326
Spelling and math.

06:57.328 --> 06:58.527
And...

06:58.529 --> 07:00.428
While I'm gone,

07:00.430 --> 07:03.364
You all will be working
on the founders' day play!

07:03.366 --> 07:04.732
[all grumbling]

07:04.734 --> 07:07.567
So that will be very exciting.

07:09.403 --> 07:12.405
All right.
You may go to recess.

07:19.512 --> 07:21.079
Emily?

07:22.581 --> 07:25.015
Are you all right?

07:25.017 --> 07:26.950
I don't want to come to school
if you're not here.

07:28.352 --> 07:30.086
Mrs. Blakeley scares me.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.655
Can I tell you
a little secret?

07:34.757 --> 07:36.691
Sometimes,
she scares me, too.

07:36.693 --> 07:38.092
[both chuckle]

07:38.094 --> 07:40.294
I'm going to
give you a present,

07:40.296 --> 07:42.896
So you won't be lonely
while I'm away.

07:42.898 --> 07:44.830
May I have your hand?

07:47.633 --> 07:49.967
Now you keep that with you
while I'm gone,

07:49.969 --> 07:52.403
And whenever you feel
scared or alone at school,

07:52.405 --> 07:54.071
All you have to do

07:54.073 --> 07:56.006
Is this...

07:56.008 --> 07:57.841
And then
you'll be reminded

07:57.843 --> 07:59.409
That I am right
there with you,

07:59.411 --> 08:00.510
Even when I'm gone.

08:00.512 --> 08:03.045
I'm gonna miss you,
miss thatcher.

08:04.213 --> 08:06.713
I'm going to miss you, too.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.217
Gowen is becoming
a real problem.

08:12.219 --> 08:13.384
Well,
what I know is,

08:13.386 --> 08:15.319
Your sawmill
provides jobs.

08:15.321 --> 08:17.354
Yes! For over half
the men in this town.

08:17.356 --> 08:19.222
Then it beats me
how can anyone can think

08:19.224 --> 08:20.556
It's in
their best interest

08:20.558 --> 08:22.758
To drive it
out of business.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.092
You know...

08:24.094 --> 08:25.393
I really
thought that deal

08:25.395 --> 08:26.560
With thatcher's company

08:26.562 --> 08:28.695
Was gonna get
things going,

08:28.697 --> 08:29.996
That I'd be able
to meet my goals.

08:29.998 --> 08:31.263
And now?

08:31.265 --> 08:32.564
Gowen sabotaging me
at every corner,

08:32.566 --> 08:34.165
I'm not sure
I'm gonna be able

08:34.167 --> 08:35.699
To deliver
on my promises.

08:35.701 --> 08:37.400
I'd have to cut jobs,

08:37.402 --> 08:39.001
And without jobs...

08:39.003 --> 08:41.336
There's not much
to keep this town going.

08:42.538 --> 08:44.171
I have to
get to work.

08:45.439 --> 08:47.473
[â™ª]

08:48.708 --> 08:50.575
Thank you.

08:53.412 --> 08:55.079
Charles...

08:55.081 --> 08:56.380
It was
so kind of you

08:56.382 --> 08:57.914
To pick us up
from the train station.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.382
Well, it was the least
I could do.

08:59.384 --> 09:01.517
This isn't gonna be easy,
is it?

09:01.519 --> 09:04.553
Well, your father doesn't
get upset very often, but...

09:04.555 --> 09:05.854
Can't blame him
this time.

09:05.856 --> 09:07.889
I suppose not.

09:07.891 --> 09:09.957
[jack]: All right.

09:09.959 --> 09:12.292
I'd best be off.

09:12.294 --> 09:13.593
Uh, jack,
if you'd like

09:13.595 --> 09:15.561
A ride to the infirmary,
it's no trouble at all.

09:15.563 --> 09:17.963
That's very generous,
but I'll make my own way.

09:17.965 --> 09:19.197
[elizabeth]: Telephone
me and let me know

09:19.199 --> 09:20.097
What's going on with tom?

09:20.099 --> 09:21.231
I will.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.198
It's gonna be
all right.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.166
I hope so.

09:34.110 --> 09:35.577
Charles.

09:35.579 --> 09:38.546
Did mr. Thatcher say anything
to you about the accident?

09:38.548 --> 09:39.947
Just that
what tom did

09:39.949 --> 09:41.581
Was reckless
and irresponsible.

09:41.583 --> 09:42.715
And you agree?

09:42.717 --> 09:45.183
It's not
my place to judge.

09:47.986 --> 09:48.986
Julie's like
a sister to me,

09:48.988 --> 09:50.087
So I'm being honest,

09:50.089 --> 09:51.088
I really can't
forgive your brother.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.823
Well, I guess
I'm not surprised.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.091
I just want what's best
for the thatcher girls.

09:55.093 --> 09:57.626
For julie
and for elizabeth.

09:57.628 --> 09:59.227
Do you know what's
best for elizabeth?

09:59.229 --> 10:00.928
Do you?

10:00.930 --> 10:04.131
I know her well enough
to let her decide for herself.

10:04.133 --> 10:06.566
With all
due respect...

10:06.568 --> 10:08.935
You don't know her at all.

10:08.937 --> 10:11.003
[crank clunks, engine chugs]

10:11.005 --> 10:13.372
[â™ª]

10:21.113 --> 10:22.413
[door opens]

10:22.415 --> 10:24.381
Just a moment!

10:32.189 --> 10:33.856
What are you doing here,
mr. Avery?

10:33.858 --> 10:36.325
I'm asking
that you to hear me out.

10:36.327 --> 10:39.260
I just want you
to understand.

10:41.796 --> 10:43.530
When I lost my parents,

10:43.532 --> 10:46.332
Nora's father,
jonas wilder,

10:46.334 --> 10:48.767
He took me in,
made sure I was taken care of,

10:48.769 --> 10:50.335
Paid for my schooling.

10:50.337 --> 10:52.303
Nora fell in love
with a drifter.

10:52.305 --> 10:53.437
She eloped with him.

10:53.439 --> 10:56.006
He deserted her
with child,

10:56.008 --> 10:58.174
And I married her
out of duty to her father,

10:58.176 --> 10:59.475
To protect her honor.

10:59.477 --> 11:01.310
And you raised the boy?

11:01.312 --> 11:03.779
As if he were
my own son.

11:03.781 --> 11:07.682
I thought nora and I
could have a life together...

11:07.684 --> 11:11.152
But when martin died...

11:11.154 --> 11:13.554
We were both devastated.

11:14.822 --> 11:16.622
And nora changed.

11:16.624 --> 11:18.056
We couldn't even
speak to each other

11:18.058 --> 11:19.490
Without fighting.

11:19.492 --> 11:20.691
So you left?

11:20.693 --> 11:21.992
No.

11:21.994 --> 11:23.293
I didn't give up,

11:23.295 --> 11:26.195
I did everything I could
to make things right.

11:26.197 --> 11:28.564
She disappeared
for nearly two years,

11:28.566 --> 11:30.165
And when I finally found her,

11:30.167 --> 11:32.367
She was living
with her father.

11:32.369 --> 11:34.068
She said the marriage
was over for her,

11:34.070 --> 11:36.336
And she wanted a divorce
and didn't want to see me.

11:36.338 --> 11:37.370
Something
must have happened

11:37.372 --> 11:38.371
To change her mind.

11:38.373 --> 11:39.705
I have no idea
what it was.

11:39.707 --> 11:40.672
I can't explain
why she showed up

11:40.674 --> 11:41.739
At your doorstep,

11:41.741 --> 11:43.140
Or how she found you.

11:43.142 --> 11:45.008
You told me your wife died.

11:45.010 --> 11:46.676
I said that I'd lost her,
and it wasn't a lie.

11:46.678 --> 11:47.843
It was a deception.

11:47.845 --> 11:49.144
I was going to
tell you everything

11:49.146 --> 11:50.145
When I came back to town.

11:50.147 --> 11:51.212
I had every reason to believe

11:51.214 --> 11:52.980
The divorce
would be official by then.

11:52.982 --> 11:54.948
But it wasn't.

11:58.652 --> 12:02.154
No, it wasn't.

12:02.156 --> 12:05.290
I made an unforgivable mistake,
abigail.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.260
At least now
you know the truth.

12:11.996 --> 12:14.397
[â™ª]

12:23.506 --> 12:25.006
Your mother's upstairs.

12:25.008 --> 12:27.241
This whole affair's been
a terrible ordeal for her.

12:27.243 --> 12:28.375
I'll go up
in a minute.

12:28.377 --> 12:30.076
Where's julie?

12:30.078 --> 12:31.944
She still won't
come out of her room.

12:31.946 --> 12:33.845
At least she can't cause
any trouble from there.

12:33.847 --> 12:35.046
I wouldn't
put it past her.

12:35.048 --> 12:36.580
Tell me everything
that happened.

12:36.582 --> 12:37.681
Apparently, the thornton boy

12:37.683 --> 12:39.182
Broke into the garage

12:39.184 --> 12:41.217
And convinced her
to go on a joy ride,

12:41.219 --> 12:42.685
Then he ran the car
off the road.

12:42.687 --> 12:44.420
The damned fool,
he could have killed them both.

12:44.422 --> 12:46.789
You're not planning on pressing
charges against tom, are you?

12:46.791 --> 12:48.791
He also took julie
to a dance hall

12:48.793 --> 12:50.459
And he broke in there as well.

12:50.461 --> 12:52.527
God knows
where else he's taken her.

12:52.529 --> 12:53.928
Julie may be headstrong,

12:53.930 --> 12:56.563
But the young man
needs to be taught a lesson.

12:56.565 --> 12:57.630
If julie continues
to fraternize

12:57.632 --> 12:58.864
With the wrong sort
of people,

12:58.866 --> 13:00.465
It could be disastrous.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.633
"the wrong sort of people."
like the thorntons?

13:04.869 --> 13:06.436
[viola]:
I didn't say that.

13:06.438 --> 13:08.704
I sent you the telegram
because this is serious.

13:08.706 --> 13:10.605
You're the only one
she listens to, elizabeth.

13:10.607 --> 13:12.039
You may think
I'm cruel at times,

13:12.041 --> 13:14.141
But I have julie's
interests at heart here.

13:14.143 --> 13:15.575
I know you do.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.410
I didn't mean to be defensive.

13:17.412 --> 13:18.711
Talk to her.

13:18.713 --> 13:20.479
Make her understand.

13:20.481 --> 13:22.614
I'll do my best.

13:25.718 --> 13:28.786
[tom]: I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

13:28.788 --> 13:31.255
It's just a bump on the head
and a couple of broken ribs.

13:31.257 --> 13:33.223
I've had worse.

13:35.159 --> 13:38.427
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

13:38.429 --> 13:39.928
I can come back later.

13:39.930 --> 13:40.995
No, it's fine.

13:40.997 --> 13:43.964
Nurse carter,
this is my brother...

13:43.966 --> 13:47.567
The incomparable
constable jack thornton.

13:47.569 --> 13:51.137
Oh! You're the mountie
tom's told me about.

13:51.139 --> 13:52.238
What else did he tell you?

13:52.240 --> 13:54.340
That you were eight-feet tall

13:54.342 --> 13:55.607
And could straighten a horseshoe
with your bare hands.

13:55.609 --> 13:57.642
Well, tom likes to exaggerate.

13:57.644 --> 13:59.543
A little.

14:01.779 --> 14:03.346
How's he doing?

14:03.348 --> 14:06.015
Two broken ribs
and a concussion.

14:06.017 --> 14:08.817
The doctor would like to
keep him here for observation.

14:08.819 --> 14:10.185
Have you heard from julie?

14:10.187 --> 14:11.986
We can talk about that later.

14:11.988 --> 14:13.354
I have no secrets
from miss carter.

14:13.356 --> 14:14.521
She knows all about
the thatchers.

14:14.523 --> 14:16.122
I have to apologize

14:16.124 --> 14:17.857
For my brother's
lack of discretion.

14:17.859 --> 14:20.092
It's all right.
Everyone knows the thatchers.

14:20.094 --> 14:21.526
They're practically--

14:21.528 --> 14:24.328
Hamilton royalty.
Yeah. I've heard.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.963
Jack has

14:25.965 --> 14:28.098
A very close relationship
with princess elizabeth.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.033
Oh?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.901
We both live in hope valley.

14:31.903 --> 14:34.103
And I escorted her
here to hamilton.

14:34.105 --> 14:35.804
Well, she's a lucky woman...

14:35.806 --> 14:38.540
To have a mountie
as an escort.

14:49.884 --> 14:51.818
[telephone ringing]

14:55.555 --> 14:58.490
Hello?

14:58.492 --> 15:01.326
I didn't expect
to hear from you again.

15:01.328 --> 15:03.494
He is?

15:03.496 --> 15:07.097
No. I didn't know he went back.

15:07.099 --> 15:09.699
Where did you see him?

15:16.072 --> 15:17.305
[florence]: I'm so eager

15:17.307 --> 15:19.840
To get started
in the classroom.

15:19.842 --> 15:22.142
Elizabeth thatcher
is too easy on the children.

15:22.144 --> 15:23.743
Young minds need discipline.

15:23.745 --> 15:27.580
Oh. Did I tell you
dottie saw bill avery

15:27.582 --> 15:30.182
Coming out of abigail's
cafe this morning?

15:30.184 --> 15:31.750
Before it was open!

15:31.752 --> 15:33.151
I would have thought

15:33.153 --> 15:35.419
Abigail would have
more purity of character

15:35.421 --> 15:38.989
Than to meet secretly with a man
of questionable integrity.

15:38.991 --> 15:41.791
How frequently
people disappoint us.

15:41.793 --> 15:43.692
[abigail]:
They certainly do.

15:43.694 --> 15:46.161
I always thought my friends
had more purity of character

15:46.163 --> 15:48.196
Than to gossip about me
behind my back.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.864
-Oh, abigail, I--
-for the record--

15:49.866 --> 15:51.198
Not that
it's any of your business--

15:51.200 --> 15:53.800
There is less than nothing
between bill avery and me.

15:53.802 --> 15:55.835
And there never will be.

15:55.837 --> 15:57.670
Have I made myself clear?

15:58.838 --> 15:59.904
Yeah.

16:01.706 --> 16:04.374
A word of advice, florence.

16:04.376 --> 16:07.443
The good book says "judge not
that you be not judged."

16:07.445 --> 16:08.610
If you went to church

16:08.612 --> 16:10.011
And actually listened
instead of gossiping,

16:10.013 --> 16:11.879
You'd hear that
only those without sin

16:11.881 --> 16:13.347
Should cast the first stone.

16:13.349 --> 16:14.448
So if you want to judge

16:14.450 --> 16:17.017
The "purity"
of someone's character,

16:17.019 --> 16:20.386
You'd do well
to start with your own.

16:21.621 --> 16:24.356
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

16:26.192 --> 16:28.326
Oh...

16:28.328 --> 16:30.061
[â™ª]

16:34.466 --> 16:37.334
[abigail]: I suppose
I got carried away, didn't I?

16:37.336 --> 16:38.868
They deserved it.

16:38.870 --> 16:41.804
And that bit about
judging was nicely put.

16:41.806 --> 16:43.572
If I ever need someone
to fill in on Sunday,

16:43.574 --> 16:46.074
I know who to ask.

16:46.076 --> 16:49.544
I suppose I'm angry.

16:49.546 --> 16:51.345
But not
with florence.

16:51.347 --> 16:54.714
No, not with florence.
With bill.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.983
Here's my two cents
about anger.

16:57.985 --> 16:59.217
It's like a toothache.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.385
See, a toothache hurts,

17:01.387 --> 17:03.553
And the only way
to fix it

17:03.555 --> 17:05.354
Is to do something
about it.

17:05.356 --> 17:06.555
We all know it,
but we put it off

17:06.557 --> 17:09.057
Because we're afraid
it'll hurt worse.

17:09.059 --> 17:10.691
But once
that tooth is gone,

17:10.693 --> 17:13.393
We feel
a whole lot better.

17:13.395 --> 17:16.529
So you're saying the only way
for me to get over being angry

17:16.531 --> 17:18.830
Is to forgive bill
for what he did.

17:20.699 --> 17:23.734
I'm not sure
I'm ready to do that.

17:23.736 --> 17:25.235
Well, it may be painful,
abigail,

17:25.237 --> 17:28.171
But you need
to pull that tooth.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.505
Trust me.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.007
You'll feel a whole lot better
once it's done.

17:40.082 --> 17:42.016
[julie]: My life is over.

17:42.018 --> 17:43.283
[elizabeth]:
That's not true.

17:43.285 --> 17:44.951
Father's forbidden me
to see tom ever again,

17:44.953 --> 17:46.585
And I'll die
if I don't see him.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.186
I'll wither away and die.

17:48.188 --> 17:50.054
-You won't die.
-Then I'll wither.

17:50.056 --> 17:52.589
Thatchers do not "wither."

17:52.591 --> 17:54.257
But breaking
into that dance hall,

17:54.259 --> 17:55.424
And then taking father's car,

17:55.426 --> 17:56.892
What were you thinking?

17:56.894 --> 17:58.393
One doesn't think
when one is in love.

17:58.395 --> 18:00.361
Well, one had
better start.

18:00.363 --> 18:02.696
Didn't I ask you to promise
not to see tom again?

18:02.698 --> 18:04.297
You asked,
I didn't promise.

18:04.299 --> 18:05.865
Julie...

18:05.867 --> 18:07.933
You know I only want
what's best for you.

18:07.935 --> 18:10.568
Then take me to visit him.
He needs me.

18:10.570 --> 18:11.635
Jack is with him.
He'll be fine.

18:11.637 --> 18:12.769
Honestly, elizabeth,

18:12.771 --> 18:14.637
I thought
you would understand how I feel,

18:14.639 --> 18:16.972
Being in love
with the wrong kind of man.

18:16.974 --> 18:18.606
I'm not in love
with "the wrong kind of man."

18:18.608 --> 18:20.774
Well, jack
is tom's brother!

18:20.776 --> 18:23.710
Yes. And that's where
the similarity ends.

18:23.712 --> 18:26.145
Tom is a good person inside.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.546
Yes, he is!

18:27.548 --> 18:28.747
But he should have
been a lot more careful

18:28.749 --> 18:30.148
Behind the wheel of that car.

18:32.050 --> 18:33.784
It wasn't his fault.

18:33.786 --> 18:35.619
The mud was slippery
and the tires skidded.

18:35.621 --> 18:37.053
It could have
happened to anyone.

18:37.055 --> 18:38.320
You shouldn't have been
out with him in the first place.

18:38.322 --> 18:40.655
I'll do as I please
with whom I please,

18:40.657 --> 18:42.623
And if father presses charges
against the man I love,

18:42.625 --> 18:44.891
I swear I shall
never speak to him again.

18:44.893 --> 18:46.592
Julie, if you want to
be treated like a grownup,

18:46.594 --> 18:48.126
Then start acting like one.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.494
Now get out of bed

18:49.496 --> 18:51.095
And stop behaving
like you're five years old.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.629
But what about tom?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.230
We can talk more about him

18:54.232 --> 18:55.497
When you're dressed
and downstairs,

18:55.499 --> 18:57.465
And not until then.

19:14.782 --> 19:17.416
[â™ª]

19:28.093 --> 19:29.993
[elizabeth sighs heavily
and viola stops playing]

19:29.995 --> 19:31.461
Any luck with julie?

19:31.463 --> 19:33.496
She's convinced
she's in love.

19:33.498 --> 19:35.331
Not with that scoundrel.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.865
Tom may have
his problems,

19:36.867 --> 19:39.000
But I wouldn't
call him a scoundrel.

19:39.002 --> 19:40.468
Of course you wouldn't.
He's jack's brother.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.669
You have to defend him.

19:41.671 --> 19:43.270
This isn't about jack.

19:43.272 --> 19:45.772
Isn't it?

19:45.774 --> 19:47.440
Forgive me
for being blunt,

19:47.442 --> 19:49.341
But everyone's asking.

19:49.343 --> 19:51.343
Do you and jack have
an understanding?

19:51.345 --> 19:52.777
An understanding
about what?

19:52.779 --> 19:55.179
I'm asking if
he's made a proposal.

19:55.181 --> 19:57.314
That's none
of your affair.

19:57.316 --> 19:59.983
Huh. So he hasn't.

19:59.985 --> 20:02.452
I'm not in any rush
to reach

20:02.454 --> 20:04.554
An "understanding"
with anyone.

20:04.556 --> 20:05.788
And, clearly,
neither is he.

20:05.790 --> 20:07.222
Jack is shy.

20:07.224 --> 20:08.990
Or maybe he realizes
how difficult

20:08.992 --> 20:10.491
It would be
for the two of you

20:10.493 --> 20:12.459
Because you come from
such different backgrounds.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.526
We're not so different.

20:13.528 --> 20:14.960
In fact,
I've adapted quite well

20:14.962 --> 20:16.695
To life in hope valley.

20:16.697 --> 20:18.063
The real issue is,

20:18.065 --> 20:19.197
When will you make up
your mind about who you are

20:19.199 --> 20:20.298
And where you belong?

20:20.300 --> 20:21.866
I know perfectly
well who I am!

20:21.868 --> 20:23.000
Really?

20:23.002 --> 20:24.735
Have you told charles?

20:24.737 --> 20:27.504
Or will you continue
leading him on?

20:27.506 --> 20:30.006
I'm not
leading him on.

20:30.008 --> 20:32.074
Charles is one of
my dearest friends.

20:32.076 --> 20:34.176
You have lots of
friends in hamilton,

20:34.178 --> 20:37.245
Yet you choose to spend
most of your time with him.

20:37.247 --> 20:40.147
I think you need
to ask yourself why.

20:40.149 --> 20:42.883
[â™ª]

21:06.873 --> 21:08.640
Mr. Avery.

21:10.009 --> 21:13.911
I never got to thank you
for all you did to find clara.

21:15.546 --> 21:16.612
You don't need to.

21:16.614 --> 21:18.680
Yes, I do.

21:18.682 --> 21:20.848
Thank you.

21:22.016 --> 21:23.750
She's a fine young woman.

21:23.752 --> 21:25.384
Please tell her
goodbye for me.

21:25.386 --> 21:27.452
I will.

21:27.454 --> 21:32.189
I know that this hasn't been
easy for either of us...

21:32.191 --> 21:34.292
But it's in the past.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.493
And I want you to know

21:35.495 --> 21:37.561
That whatever
happened between us,

21:37.563 --> 21:41.064
I wish you the best of luck
with everything.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.466
I mean that.

21:44.901 --> 21:46.868
Thank you.

21:50.638 --> 21:53.206
[â™ª]

22:02.849 --> 22:04.916
Going on a bit
of a run here.

22:12.056 --> 22:14.590
Who is that
distinguished gentleman

22:14.592 --> 22:16.491
In the expensive suit?

22:16.493 --> 22:19.093
[lee]: Bertram p. Harriman.
Railroad magnate.

22:19.095 --> 22:20.327
He's here
to approve the deal

22:20.329 --> 22:21.695
That's gonna
make gowen rich.

22:21.697 --> 22:23.029
The deal hasn't
gone through yet?

22:23.031 --> 22:24.930
May as well.

22:24.932 --> 22:26.865
Tried everything I can
to change his mind,

22:26.867 --> 22:29.267
But no cigar.

22:29.269 --> 22:31.102
It's not like you
to give up.

22:31.104 --> 22:33.504
I'm not giving up.

22:33.506 --> 22:35.072
I never give up.

22:35.074 --> 22:38.775
I'm just out of
options at the moment.

22:38.777 --> 22:40.276
You've taken the last
four pots, mr. Gowen.

22:40.278 --> 22:42.378
Well, I hope
you'll forgive me.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.113
I mean, given our
new business relationship,

22:44.115 --> 22:46.215
I would think it'd be
more prudent of me to lose,

22:46.217 --> 22:49.751
But, well, I just
don't work that way.

22:49.753 --> 22:52.386
There's no point in playing
unless you're out for blood.

22:52.388 --> 22:54.221
Clean me out,
if you can.

22:54.223 --> 22:55.855
I'll respect you
all the more for it.

22:55.857 --> 22:57.356
-[chuckles]
-besides...

22:57.358 --> 22:59.458
I can afford it.

22:59.460 --> 23:02.294
You certainly can.

23:17.977 --> 23:19.344
Jack!

23:21.880 --> 23:25.415
I almost didn't recognize you
out of uniform.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.884
Please, join me.

23:27.886 --> 23:29.952
You're not
expecting anybody else?

23:29.954 --> 23:31.219
Oh, no.
I usually eat alone,

23:31.221 --> 23:33.387
So I can read up
on my patients' files.

23:33.389 --> 23:35.122
Okay.

23:35.124 --> 23:38.058
You seem very dedicated
to your work.

23:38.060 --> 23:40.393
I am! I get the feeling
you are, too.

23:40.395 --> 23:42.561
It must run in your family.

23:42.563 --> 23:44.296
[chuckles] wait.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.498
Did tom tell you our dad
was a mountie?

23:46.500 --> 23:48.166
You have no secrets from me.

23:48.168 --> 23:50.801
Well, that puts me
at a disadvantage.

23:50.803 --> 23:52.636
[laughs] my mother was a nurse,

23:52.638 --> 23:53.803
So I know what it's like

23:53.805 --> 23:55.805
To carry on
the family profession.

23:55.807 --> 23:57.907
Not that I'm complaining
about my work.

23:57.909 --> 24:00.676
I like making a difference
in people's lives.

24:00.678 --> 24:02.177
So do I.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.712
I can tell.

24:06.014 --> 24:08.782
Speaking of-of medical files...

24:08.784 --> 24:11.151
I wonder
if I could see tom's?

24:11.153 --> 24:13.186
Are you asking officially?

24:13.188 --> 24:14.654
Actually, I'm asking
more as a friend.

24:14.656 --> 24:17.156
Well, I'm glad to hear
we're friends.

24:17.158 --> 24:18.757
I'll see what I can do.

24:18.759 --> 24:19.791
Thank you.

24:19.793 --> 24:23.194
I appreciate your help.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.830
How are the thatchers
holding up?

24:26.832 --> 24:29.199
William thatcher
is pretty upset,

24:29.201 --> 24:30.533
As you can imagine.

24:30.535 --> 24:33.202
Certainly he doesn't
blame you for what happened?

24:33.204 --> 24:34.870
I guess
I blame myself a little.

24:34.872 --> 24:36.938
Tom's my brother.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.105
That's not fair.

24:38.107 --> 24:39.372
Well, I introduced them.

24:39.374 --> 24:40.940
You're being
too hard on yourself.

24:40.942 --> 24:42.274
[door opens]

24:42.276 --> 24:44.109
[viola]: Well, if it
isn't constable thornton.

24:44.111 --> 24:46.044
Sir lionel.
Viola.

24:46.046 --> 24:48.179
Lionel spotted you
through the window,

24:48.181 --> 24:51.015
And we thought we would
just pop in and say hello.

24:51.017 --> 24:55.018
Oh, this is faith.
Miss-- miss carter.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.786
She is the nurse
at the infirmary.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.187
She's taking care of tom.

24:58.189 --> 24:59.755
Delighted to make
your acquaintance.

25:03.192 --> 25:05.560
We don't mean to keep
you from your dinner.

25:05.562 --> 25:08.729
Oh, no. We were just meeting
to discuss tom's health.

25:08.731 --> 25:11.665
Let him know we wish him
a speedy recovery.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.400
Yes. Of course.

25:24.478 --> 25:27.779
[nora]: I have good news.
Bill's on his way home.

25:29.047 --> 25:31.982
Seems to me he's been away
a very long time.

25:31.984 --> 25:33.183
The life of a mountie.

25:33.185 --> 25:35.084
He's one of the best
men they have.

25:35.086 --> 25:36.752
I always knew he had
a bright future,

25:36.754 --> 25:38.820
From the time
he was a young boy.

25:38.822 --> 25:41.155
Bill idolizes you, papa.

25:41.157 --> 25:43.023
You did so much for him.

25:43.025 --> 25:45.759
He owes you everything.

25:45.761 --> 25:49.495
Obligation...
Not the same thing as love.

25:49.497 --> 25:51.230
No. Of course not.

25:51.232 --> 25:53.832
Sometimes...

25:53.834 --> 25:55.200
Two people...

25:55.202 --> 25:57.435
Even the best of people,

25:57.437 --> 25:59.937
Aren't meant to be together.

25:59.939 --> 26:02.839
Bill and I
are very happy together.

26:04.174 --> 26:06.875
No one is to blame
for what happened, nora.

26:06.877 --> 26:10.010
Not you.
Not bill.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.812
[â™ª]

26:17.183 --> 26:18.249
I assure you,

26:18.251 --> 26:20.084
There was
no mechanical failure.

26:20.086 --> 26:22.086
The fault lies squarely
with the driver.

26:22.088 --> 26:25.122
I'm not disputing that.

26:25.124 --> 26:28.091
Then I don't see the point
of inspecting the vehicle.

26:28.093 --> 26:29.892
Well...

26:29.894 --> 26:31.460
It's standard procedure

26:31.462 --> 26:33.495
With an automobile
accident.

26:34.763 --> 26:36.764
I've made
some inquiries.

26:36.766 --> 26:39.133
Your brother
has a long history

26:39.135 --> 26:40.868
Of brushes
with the law.

26:40.870 --> 26:42.636
Good news travels fast.

26:42.638 --> 26:44.237
Doesn't it alarm you
that he continues

26:44.239 --> 26:46.606
To find himself
in trouble?

26:46.608 --> 26:48.608
It does.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.376
But I'm not sure
being thrown in jail

26:51.378 --> 26:52.410
Is going to help tom.

26:52.412 --> 26:54.311
He committed
a crime.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.413
Everyone makes mistakes,
mr. Thatcher.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.482
The true test of a man
is how he recovers from them.

26:59.484 --> 27:00.616
That may be,

27:00.618 --> 27:02.050
But I want
your assurance

27:02.052 --> 27:04.886
That your brother will
stop seeing my daughter.

27:04.888 --> 27:06.854
I'll see
what I can do.

27:09.891 --> 27:11.224
I'm not sure
the association

27:11.226 --> 27:12.592
Between the thorntons
and the thatchers

27:12.594 --> 27:15.227
Has proven
to be a happy one.

27:15.229 --> 27:17.962
Are you asking me
to stop seeing elizabeth?

27:19.631 --> 27:22.633
No.

27:22.635 --> 27:24.401
I'm hoping that
your concern for her--

27:24.403 --> 27:25.969
And for our family--

27:25.971 --> 27:27.236
Will lead you
to a decision

27:27.238 --> 27:29.271
That would show how much
you care about elizabeth--

27:29.273 --> 27:30.939
And her future.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.941
Mr. Thatcher...

27:32.943 --> 27:35.910
I care a great deal
about your daughter.

27:38.747 --> 27:40.881
[â™ª]

27:45.119 --> 27:47.620
[lee]:
Working on your advice column?

27:47.622 --> 27:51.990
Well, I'm trying, but...
I can't stop watching this.

27:51.992 --> 27:53.491
[lee]: So they've been
playing all night?

27:53.493 --> 27:55.326
[rosemary]:
I heard they broke at midnight

27:55.328 --> 27:56.760
And started up an hour ago.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.528
What's so fascinating?

27:58.530 --> 28:00.129
Well, gowen...

28:00.131 --> 28:02.264
[whispers]:
...Is cheating.

28:02.266 --> 28:03.798
-He's cheating?
-Mm-hmm.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.099
[lee]: How do you know?

28:05.101 --> 28:07.434
Okay, see that man
over there by the pillar?

28:07.436 --> 28:08.902
-Yeah?
-Just watch.

28:13.173 --> 28:14.439
[rosemary chuckles]

28:14.441 --> 28:16.307
I'll be...

28:16.309 --> 28:18.108
He's a spotter.

28:18.110 --> 28:20.810
[rosemary]: He certainly is.
He sees harriman's hand,

28:20.812 --> 28:23.712
And he signals to gowen
whether it's strong or weak.

28:23.714 --> 28:26.047
How do you know
so much about poker?

28:26.049 --> 28:28.949
Well, a lady
is allowed her secrets.

28:28.951 --> 28:31.283
Yes, she is.

28:33.119 --> 28:34.686
Listen...

28:34.688 --> 28:36.120
There might be
a way to beat gowen

28:36.122 --> 28:37.688
At his own game.

28:37.690 --> 28:39.456
I was thinking
the same thing.

28:39.458 --> 28:42.659
It might require a little
bit of teamwork, though.

28:42.661 --> 28:44.727
I was hoping you'd ask.

28:44.729 --> 28:45.728
Okay.

28:45.730 --> 28:47.830
[whispering]

28:47.832 --> 28:50.032
[â™ª]

28:51.167 --> 28:52.567
How's julie doing?

28:52.569 --> 28:54.735
Mm. She's devastated

28:54.737 --> 28:56.837
That father won't let
her see your brother.

28:56.839 --> 28:59.406
Did she say what
caused the accident?

28:59.408 --> 29:02.242
The road was muddy
and the car skidded.

29:02.244 --> 29:04.544
I knew things wouldn't
end well between them.

29:04.546 --> 29:05.912
The last time
we were in hamilton,

29:05.914 --> 29:07.880
I told her to break
things off with tom.

29:07.882 --> 29:09.815
Well, I gave him
the same advice.

29:09.817 --> 29:11.149
Good.

29:11.151 --> 29:12.683
Julie's always been
attracted to men

29:12.685 --> 29:14.251
Who are trouble.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.519
Well, did you
ever think maybe

29:16.521 --> 29:19.155
Julie could be responsible
for some of that trouble?

29:19.157 --> 29:21.290
She's not the one who
broke into the garage!

29:21.292 --> 29:23.391
Well, but it could've
been her idea.

29:26.128 --> 29:27.828
Are you blaming
my sister

29:27.830 --> 29:29.462
For what happened?

29:29.464 --> 29:30.930
All I'm saying

29:30.932 --> 29:33.265
Is there could be more
to the story than you think.

29:33.267 --> 29:35.300
And when someone
as prominent as your father

29:35.302 --> 29:37.935
Threatens to press charges
against someone like my brother,

29:37.937 --> 29:39.803
The consequences can be serious.

29:39.805 --> 29:42.138
Well, maybe the consequences
need to be serious

29:42.140 --> 29:43.606
For tom's own good.

29:45.308 --> 29:48.877
Well, maybe they need to be
serious for julie as well.

29:50.112 --> 29:52.079
[â™ª]

29:57.050 --> 29:59.284
[spotter coughs]

29:59.286 --> 30:00.518
[he clears his throat]

30:03.388 --> 30:05.422
Call.

30:09.826 --> 30:10.959
Two pair.

30:10.961 --> 30:13.093
Queens and deuces.

30:15.196 --> 30:16.396
Three 10s.

30:17.464 --> 30:18.730
[chuckling]

30:18.732 --> 30:20.131
[harriman]:
Thank you, mr. Gowen,

30:20.133 --> 30:22.533
For the most challenging game
I've had in a long while.

30:22.535 --> 30:24.368
I don't often lose.

30:24.370 --> 30:25.635
Well, neither do I.

30:25.637 --> 30:28.304
Excellent. I only do
business with winners.

30:28.306 --> 30:30.172
Gentlemen.

30:30.174 --> 30:31.673
Heard there was
a game going on.

30:31.675 --> 30:32.840
Too late to get in on it?

30:32.842 --> 30:34.575
[coins clattering]

30:34.577 --> 30:37.344
Mr. Harriman and I have
some business to attend to.

30:37.346 --> 30:38.678
Oh. Come on, henry.
What's wrong?

30:38.680 --> 30:41.080
You've been bleeding me dry
since I came to town.

30:41.082 --> 30:42.648
I should think that
you'd jump at the chance

30:42.650 --> 30:43.815
To take more of my money.

30:43.817 --> 30:46.818
Well, under
different circumstances,

30:46.820 --> 30:50.487
I would be delighted, but--

30:50.489 --> 30:51.654
But you're a coward.

30:52.689 --> 30:53.722
Is that it?

30:53.724 --> 30:55.023
Mr. Gowen,

30:55.025 --> 30:57.358
A challenge
has been given.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.827
I suggest you pick up
the gauntlet.

30:59.829 --> 31:01.762
Why, thank you.

31:08.936 --> 31:12.004
The medical report
seems to be in order.

31:12.006 --> 31:13.238
Thanks.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.373
He wasn't
driving, was he?

31:15.375 --> 31:17.108
What makes you say that?

31:17.110 --> 31:20.411
There had to be a reason
you wanted to see his file.

31:20.413 --> 31:22.079
I'm guessing
you've examined the car

31:22.081 --> 31:23.914
And found some evidence?

31:23.916 --> 31:25.348
There's a crack
in the windshield

31:25.350 --> 31:26.515
On the passenger side
of the car.

31:26.517 --> 31:28.049
It's consistent
with tom's head injury.

31:28.051 --> 31:30.084
Miss thatcher
was behind the wheel,

31:30.086 --> 31:32.019
And your brother is lying
to protect her?

31:32.021 --> 31:34.688
She doesn't have a license,
which means she broke the law,

31:34.690 --> 31:36.589
And she is probably terrified
of what her father would do

31:36.591 --> 31:38.123
If he found out
she was driving.

31:38.125 --> 31:39.624
Y-you have to get tom
to tell the truth.

31:39.626 --> 31:40.758
Well, he won't do it.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.726
He puts on a tough act,
but deep down,

31:42.728 --> 31:45.228
He's the most loyal person
I know.

31:45.230 --> 31:47.530
He'll never betray julie.

31:47.532 --> 31:50.432
You care about him
very much, don't you?

31:52.301 --> 31:53.734
Well, he had
a tough time of it,

31:53.736 --> 31:55.035
Growing up without a dad.

31:55.037 --> 31:57.270
I grew up without a mom.

31:57.272 --> 31:59.705
She died when I was 10.

31:59.707 --> 32:01.640
I still miss her,

32:01.642 --> 32:03.141
But being a nurse
like she was

32:03.143 --> 32:05.209
Makes me feel closer
to her somehow.

32:05.211 --> 32:06.476
Same way as being a mountie

32:06.478 --> 32:07.944
Makes me feel close
to my father.

32:07.946 --> 32:09.946
Your brother doesn't have that.

32:09.948 --> 32:12.214
It's harder on him
than on you.

32:13.449 --> 32:15.450
You're very perceptive,
you know that?

32:15.452 --> 32:17.718
Comes with the job.

32:19.387 --> 32:21.721
[â™ª]

32:26.559 --> 32:28.159
I raise....

32:28.161 --> 32:30.794
50.

32:30.796 --> 32:32.662
[spotter coughing]

32:34.665 --> 32:35.765
Call.

32:35.767 --> 32:36.732
[chip clatters]

32:39.068 --> 32:41.034
Kings full of sixes.

32:43.637 --> 32:45.771
Gentlemen, I need
to get some air.

32:45.773 --> 32:47.739
If you'll excuse me.

32:49.274 --> 32:51.307
Drinks are on me.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.577
[background chatter]

33:04.853 --> 33:06.820
Hello, stranger.

33:08.088 --> 33:09.421
Hello.

33:09.423 --> 33:11.522
I haven't seen you
around town before.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.025
But I know your type.

33:16.460 --> 33:19.862
I've been watching you...

33:19.864 --> 33:22.764
And I think you and I
need to have a little chat.

33:30.472 --> 33:32.673
[viola]: It's good to see
your appetite has returned.

33:32.675 --> 33:34.941
There's no sense
in me withering away.

33:34.943 --> 33:36.008
I have to keep strong

33:36.010 --> 33:37.509
If I'm gonna fight
for the man I love.

33:37.511 --> 33:39.477
I thought you talked
some sense into her.

33:39.479 --> 33:40.478
Let's just
be grateful

33:40.480 --> 33:42.313
She's come
out of her room.

33:42.315 --> 33:43.614
So what have you heard
about tom?

33:43.616 --> 33:44.848
He's better,

33:44.850 --> 33:45.882
But they're keeping
him in the infirmary

33:45.884 --> 33:47.049
Just to be sure.

33:47.051 --> 33:48.850
You must convince father
to let me visit.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.117
I need to see him
to know he's all right.

33:50.119 --> 33:51.184
Jack will let us know

33:51.186 --> 33:53.386
If there's anything
to worry about.

33:54.888 --> 33:56.488
Apparently, constable thornton
has struck up

33:56.490 --> 33:58.189
A friendship with tom's nurse.

33:58.191 --> 33:59.690
Who told you that?

33:59.692 --> 34:01.158
Lionel and I were
having dinner downtown.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.392
We spotted them in a restaurant.

34:02.394 --> 34:04.560
Jack didn't say
anything about it.

34:04.562 --> 34:06.028
[viola]:
Hmm. She's very pretty.

34:06.030 --> 34:09.031
And they were deeply
involved in conversation.

34:09.033 --> 34:11.066
I'm surprised
he didn't mention it.

34:12.401 --> 34:14.901
I'm sure jack has more
important things to think about.

34:16.904 --> 34:18.971
[â™ª]

34:20.073 --> 34:21.606
I'll take one.

34:27.312 --> 34:29.579
I bet...

34:29.581 --> 34:31.147
50.

34:31.149 --> 34:32.548
No. Wait.

34:32.550 --> 34:34.583
100.

34:35.918 --> 34:37.385
I'll see your hundred,

34:37.387 --> 34:40.554
I'll raise you
whatever you have left.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.155
No, lee--

34:44.525 --> 34:46.425
I'll re-raise you.

34:46.427 --> 34:47.826
"re-raise"?

34:47.828 --> 34:49.494
You're busted.

34:49.496 --> 34:52.096
No, I'm not busted,
and I am gonna re-raise you.

34:52.098 --> 34:54.665
I raise you...

34:54.667 --> 34:56.833
My sawmill.

34:56.835 --> 34:58.501
No, lee. Your sawmill?

34:58.503 --> 35:00.870
[â™ª]

35:00.872 --> 35:02.605
You want it, gowen?

35:02.607 --> 35:05.107
Here it is.
Come and get it.

35:05.109 --> 35:06.541
Please, don't do this.
You could lose everything.

35:06.543 --> 35:08.075
Stay out of this, rosemary.

35:09.177 --> 35:11.111
What am I gonna call with?

35:11.113 --> 35:12.679
With your land.

35:12.681 --> 35:14.547
The parcel you're using
for the railway.

35:14.549 --> 35:17.082
I can't make a profit
if you control the right of way.

35:17.084 --> 35:19.084
You've seen to that. So...

35:19.086 --> 35:21.219
It's all or nothing.

35:21.221 --> 35:23.721
For you... Or for me.

35:23.723 --> 35:26.090
Mayor gowen, I beg you.

35:26.092 --> 35:27.558
Mr. Coulter's
not in his straight mind.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.959
It isn't fair to take advantage
of his desperation.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.060
Rosemary.

35:30.062 --> 35:32.095
Would you please sit down?

35:32.097 --> 35:33.563
I'm trying to help you.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.931
I don't need your help!

35:34.933 --> 35:36.532
For the last time...

35:36.534 --> 35:38.234
Sit down.

35:41.871 --> 35:44.271
[sniffles]

35:46.974 --> 35:48.907
[spotter coughs]

35:51.243 --> 35:52.610
It's a bet.

35:57.382 --> 35:58.515
[slides cards and flips]

35:58.517 --> 36:01.651
Club flush, king high.

36:01.653 --> 36:05.021
[â™ª]

36:05.023 --> 36:07.223
You think I'd fall
for your bluff?

36:07.225 --> 36:09.325
[lee exhaling deeply]

36:10.660 --> 36:13.061
I knew you would.

36:13.063 --> 36:15.562
Only... I wasn't bluffing.

36:17.598 --> 36:19.498
Four sevens.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.765
[spectators cheering]

36:20.767 --> 36:22.199
[laughing]

36:22.201 --> 36:24.868
[rosemary]: You won!

36:24.870 --> 36:27.337
[applause and cheering continue]

36:27.339 --> 36:30.106
Mr. Gowen,
again, I must thank you--

36:30.108 --> 36:32.675
That was even more entertaining
than our game.

36:32.677 --> 36:34.610
Mr. Coulter, well done.

36:34.612 --> 36:36.712
I truly thought
you were bluffing as well.

36:36.714 --> 36:38.513
I believe it is you and I

36:38.515 --> 36:40.248
Who now have business
to discuss.

36:40.250 --> 36:41.349
I look forward
to it, sir.

36:42.551 --> 36:44.451
Congratulations.
It's a miracle!

36:44.453 --> 36:46.619
[both laughing]

36:47.787 --> 36:50.121
Fantastic, eh, gentlemen?
Drinks are on me!

36:54.192 --> 36:56.726
[indistinct exchange]

36:56.728 --> 36:58.294
How much longer
do I gotta stay in here?

36:58.296 --> 36:59.895
As long as it takes.

36:59.897 --> 37:02.964
Those ribs might be on the mend,
but concussions can be tricky.

37:02.966 --> 37:05.366
It's just a scratch!
I'm telling you.

37:05.368 --> 37:08.936
A funny thing
about that scratch...

37:08.938 --> 37:10.270
There's a crack
on the windshield

37:10.272 --> 37:11.738
Of the passenger side

37:11.740 --> 37:12.772
Of the car,

37:12.774 --> 37:14.206
Mot the driver's
side.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.941
Like you said...
Funny thing.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.609
Someone's head
hit the window,

37:17.611 --> 37:19.043
And it wasn't
julie's.

37:19.045 --> 37:21.078
Well, maybe
something else hit it.

37:21.080 --> 37:24.748
Come on, tom.
Admit it.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.550
Julie was driving when
the accident happened.

37:27.552 --> 37:28.984
-You're nuts.
-Protecting her is noble.

37:28.986 --> 37:30.285
I understand.

37:30.287 --> 37:31.552
But you need
to tell the truth.

37:31.554 --> 37:32.653
I am telling the truth.

37:32.655 --> 37:34.388
Do you understand
that william thatcher

37:34.390 --> 37:35.622
Thinks you nearly killed
his daughter?

37:35.624 --> 37:36.923
I'm not gonna
get julie in trouble!

37:36.925 --> 37:38.124
He's gonna forgive her,

37:38.126 --> 37:39.492
But he will never
forgive you.

37:39.494 --> 37:40.826
Sure he will.

37:40.828 --> 37:43.428
Everyone likes me.
I'm a charming fellow.

37:43.430 --> 37:45.296
You wanna be serious
for once?

37:45.298 --> 37:47.765
All right.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.333
[sighs heavily]

37:49.335 --> 37:50.467
Seriously.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.836
Tell me about
faith carter.

37:53.838 --> 37:54.970
I can tell--

37:54.972 --> 37:56.905
You're not
helping yourself, tom.

37:58.107 --> 37:59.407
You know... Mm.

37:59.409 --> 38:01.475
I think my head's starting
to hurt after all.

38:01.477 --> 38:03.577
I'm gonna take a little rest.

38:04.845 --> 38:07.012
Close the door on your way out.

38:21.593 --> 38:24.294
So just how did
you persuade gowen's spotter

38:24.296 --> 38:25.828
To give him
the wrong signal?

38:25.830 --> 38:26.862
Oh, I've dealt
with lots of men

38:26.864 --> 38:27.963
Like him,

38:27.965 --> 38:29.597
And their only
loyalty is money,

38:29.599 --> 38:30.998
So I just offered him

38:31.000 --> 38:33.033
Three times what
gowen was paying him.

38:33.035 --> 38:34.634
That's my girl!

38:34.636 --> 38:36.769
Now, suppose gowen
still had the better hand?

38:36.771 --> 38:37.669
[lee]: Oh, I knew he didn't.

38:37.671 --> 38:38.803
How?

38:38.805 --> 38:41.605
Because when
I was begging gowen

38:41.607 --> 38:42.772
To let lee
off the hook,

38:42.774 --> 38:44.707
I may have snuck

38:44.709 --> 38:47.643
A teeny little
peek at his hand.

38:47.645 --> 38:50.312
She gave me the signal,
so I knew that I had him beat.

38:50.314 --> 38:52.380
Like this.

38:52.382 --> 38:53.381
[sniffles]

38:53.383 --> 38:54.548
You see?

38:54.550 --> 38:56.049
It's very
convincing, right?

38:56.051 --> 38:57.350
[laughing]

38:57.352 --> 38:59.685
Oh, I wish I had been there
to see that.

38:59.687 --> 39:01.053
Well, the good news is,

39:01.055 --> 39:02.788
The railroad company
is in business with me now,

39:02.790 --> 39:05.891
So that spur line's is going
to go exactly where it should.

39:05.893 --> 39:07.726
And?

39:07.728 --> 39:09.694
And... What?

39:09.696 --> 39:12.530
And with all the money
that you won from gowen,

39:12.532 --> 39:13.864
You are going
to build me

39:13.866 --> 39:14.898
The biggest theater

39:14.900 --> 39:16.833
This side of
the rocky mountains!

39:16.835 --> 39:17.967
[rosemary chuckles]

39:19.135 --> 39:20.869
So it would seem.

39:20.871 --> 39:22.904
To the future
of hope valley!

39:22.906 --> 39:24.572
Hear, hear.

39:24.574 --> 39:27.107
To the future.

39:28.509 --> 39:30.643
The evidence
is clear as day.

39:30.645 --> 39:33.045
Tom was in
the passenger seat.

39:33.047 --> 39:34.679
But julie
wouldn't lie to me.

39:34.681 --> 39:36.681
She was driving
without a license,

39:36.683 --> 39:38.916
And she's scared
to death of your father.

39:38.918 --> 39:39.917
Is that
what tom told you?

39:39.919 --> 39:41.351
No. He said

39:41.353 --> 39:43.219
He didn't want to
get her in trouble.

39:43.221 --> 39:45.688
But I convinced his nurse

39:45.690 --> 39:47.489
To show me
the doctor's report--

39:47.491 --> 39:48.490
-Oh, yes.
-And ev--

39:48.492 --> 39:49.691
The nurse.

39:49.693 --> 39:51.225
-What about her?
-Heard you two--

39:51.227 --> 39:53.560
...Have been spending
some free time together.

39:53.562 --> 39:55.328
We happened to be having
dinner at the same place.

39:55.330 --> 39:56.762
She was alone,
I was alone.

39:56.764 --> 39:59.197
We started talking
about tom, that's all.

39:59.199 --> 40:01.098
It's wonderful
she's been so helpful.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.232
Elizabeth--

40:02.234 --> 40:05.001
I'm trying to keep
my brother out of jail,

40:05.003 --> 40:08.404
And faith agrees with me
that tom wasn't driving.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.039
So you two are on
a first-name basis?

40:11.041 --> 40:13.574
You spend time
with charles,

40:13.576 --> 40:15.042
So why shouldn't
I have dinner with someone

40:15.044 --> 40:16.710
Who's trying to help
my brother?

40:16.712 --> 40:18.745
Charles...

40:18.747 --> 40:20.246
Is a friend.

40:20.248 --> 40:21.380
A "friend"

40:21.382 --> 40:22.581
Who would ask
for your hand

40:22.583 --> 40:24.082
The very second
I was out of the picture,

40:24.084 --> 40:25.850
But I never questioned
your intentions.

40:25.852 --> 40:27.318
Not once.

40:28.687 --> 40:31.121
I have never given you
a reason not to trust me.

40:31.123 --> 40:33.156
Neither have I.

40:34.458 --> 40:37.226
Then why didn't you
tell me about your new friend?

40:37.228 --> 40:40.662
Because your family
doesn't get to run my life.

40:41.764 --> 40:44.031
That's completely unfair.

40:44.033 --> 40:45.265
No. What's unfair

40:45.267 --> 40:47.867
Is tom taking the blame
for what julie did.

40:47.869 --> 40:50.769
Now, you need to convince her
tell your father the truth

40:50.771 --> 40:52.070
About what happened.

40:52.072 --> 40:53.538
And you need to talk to tom

40:53.540 --> 40:55.473
About growing up
and being responsible.

40:55.475 --> 40:56.774
Fine.

40:56.776 --> 40:57.941
Fine.

40:57.943 --> 40:59.208
Good.

40:59.210 --> 41:00.576
Good.

41:00.578 --> 41:02.911
Well, if that's all,

41:02.913 --> 41:04.812
I think
I should be going.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.214
Don't let me
keep you.

41:13.987 --> 41:15.387
Jack...

41:17.223 --> 41:20.091
What's happening?

41:20.093 --> 41:22.826
I'm not sure.

41:24.929 --> 41:27.063
[â™ª]

41:32.902 --> 41:36.905
[â™ª]
