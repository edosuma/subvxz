00:12.012 --> 00:14.723
A sitting of
the Senate Judiciary Committee

00:14.806 --> 00:18.227
was sensationally interrupted last night
by an audacious hack,

00:18.310 --> 00:20.354
carried out by a group
claiming to have kidnapped

00:20.437 --> 00:23.565
the only son of
PR supremo Katherine Newman.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.359
Miss Newman was due to be confirmed

00:25.442 --> 00:28.320
as the president's nomination
for the role of US ambassador to the UK.

00:28.403 --> 00:31.240
Tell the truth, Katherine,

00:31.323 --> 00:35.035
or your son dies
with the whole world watching.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.287
In what has to be described
as a ransom demand,

00:37.371 --> 00:40.040
Miss Newman was instructed
to "tell the truth"

00:40.123 --> 00:41.792
in order to win her son's freedom.

00:42.376 --> 00:46.880
…that shocking hostage video
and highly unusual ransom request.

00:46.964 --> 00:50.425
In it, Katherine Newman, Leo's mother
and Head of Cooper Newman PR,

00:50.509 --> 00:52.386
was instructed to "tell the truth."

00:52.469 --> 00:54.930
…Cooper Newman PR,
has finally been confirmed

00:55.013 --> 00:57.057
as the president's nomination
for US ambassador.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.977
…here outside
the hotel where Leo Newman was last seen

01:00.060 --> 01:01.979
in those now infamous pictures.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.857
While we continue to await comment
from Katherine Newman,

01:04.940 --> 01:08.151
the world of social media has been
anything but quiet.

01:08.235 --> 01:12.990
"Tell the truth" is trending worldwide.
Its hashtag-like logo is being used

01:13.073 --> 01:15.742
to highlight
stories of corporate dishonesty

01:15.826 --> 01:17.786
right across the globe.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.140
…clients of PR giant Cooper Newman.

02:20.224 --> 02:23.810
The instruction to "tell the truth"
took on a new direction.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.563
Cooper Newman PR
is yet to comment on the release...

02:26.647 --> 02:28.649
You running to him or from him?

02:28.732 --> 02:31.818
...featuring Leo Newman,
son of Katherine Newman.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.696
The shocking piece of film
sensationally bombed

02:34.780 --> 02:36.949
a sitting of
the United States Senate Committee,

02:37.032 --> 02:41.537
demanding that the ambassadorial nominee,
Miss Newman, "tell the truth."

02:41.620 --> 02:45.791
Sources in New York suggest that the FBI
are preparing to stage a news conference

02:45.874 --> 02:46.875
within the hour.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.717
Hey, it's starting!

02:55.801 --> 02:57.594
He was taken from the Park Madison Hotel

02:57.678 --> 02:59.930
in Midtown, Manhattan
and is still missing.

03:00.472 --> 03:04.393
We can also confirm that, having received
proof of life and a ransom demand,

03:04.476 --> 03:07.354
that this is now a kidnapping
rather than an abduction,

03:07.437 --> 03:09.064
and will be investigated as such.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.610
We'd ask the individuals who made
the demands to be more specific

03:13.694 --> 03:16.488
about exactly what
"truth" they're referring to.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.490
-It's dangerous.
-I'm not gonna comment on...

03:18.574 --> 03:20.909
In my experience,
kidnappers who don't make material demands

03:20.993 --> 03:23.203
will always ask for more and more
if you engage with them.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.081
Well, how else do we find out
who the hell we're dealing with here?

03:26.164 --> 03:29.251
We'd also ask,
if anybody has seen this man,

03:29.334 --> 03:31.795
-to contact law enforcement immediately.
-What the hell?

03:32.337 --> 03:37.009
Do not approach under any circumstances.
He's known to be extremely dangerous.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.761
He may be in Europe,
but is accustomed to moving around

03:39.845 --> 03:42.306
and is believed to be using
the name Sean Tilson.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.725
-Did you know about this?
-Look, we need to squeeze Tilson.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.810
Is "the truth"
connected to the ambassador job?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.730
Is it true that
there have already been arrests in the UK?

03:49.813 --> 03:52.691
I'm not gonna comment on
any online speculation.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.320
What we will say is that
we are liaising with UK law enforcement

03:56.403 --> 03:58.822
-about several persons of interest.
-Okay, that I didn't know about.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.866
This makes the whole
surveillance operation pointless.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.034
We're supposed to cooperate.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.703
How can I share intel with you
if I can't rely on the basic assumption

04:04.786 --> 04:07.122
-you're not gonna share it with the world?
-He only named Tilson!

04:07.206 --> 04:09.416
Yes, but they will all go to ground,
won't they?

04:10.083 --> 04:13.295
Do not lose those targets! Fuck's sake.

04:13.378 --> 04:17.216
Leo's girlfriend, Erin Torrance,
is gonna say a few words.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.887
If anybody saw anything or knows anything,

04:22.804 --> 04:24.806
please contact the authorities.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.017
We want Leo back.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.797
What the hell happened?

05:38.881 --> 05:42.426
They kept my phone. I'm so sorry.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.263
Oh, my God. We've been going mad.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.934
Can you-- I don't--
I don't have any money.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.019
Yeah. Sure.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.939
Mum. I'm so sorry.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.733
What you got to be sorry for?

05:57.816 --> 06:00.235
-How much?
-Twenty quid, thank you.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.070
-No worries.
-Awesome. Cheers, mate.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.659
Tell me everything.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.079
Don't make me
go through it all again right now.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.582
-I just wanna get changed.
-Okay.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.925
What are you looking for?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.803
They took my phone.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.306
And I know that
I've got an old one here somewhere.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
Anything else?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.148
Where is it?

06:38.232 --> 06:39.441
What?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.777
Come on, Mon. I'm serious.
Where have you put it?

06:42.277 --> 06:43.403
Put what? Say it.

06:46.031 --> 06:50.077
The money, okay? It's not mine.
I'm looking after it for someone.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.703
And they want it back.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.290
"Wait for instructions."
What does "instructions" mean?

06:56.208 --> 06:57.501
Tell me you did not reply.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.545
No. I didn't reply.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.089
What's this about?
What's New York got to do with it?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.385
-I can't, Mon.
-Fine.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.470
Then I can't tell you where the bag is.

07:08.554 --> 07:09.721
Just give me--

07:09.805 --> 07:10.931
-Whoa!
-Hey!

07:11.014 --> 07:12.724
I'm getting changed!

07:12.808 --> 07:16.311
So? You know I am supposed to be
your husband by now.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.022
-Well, Mon is helping me.
-No, I'm not.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.443
The whole truth.
Or I'll tell him right now.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.156
This is me.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.533
So, what are you doing?

07:32.244 --> 07:35.372
Not here. Meet me at the market.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.499
Okay.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.969
I just need to sort my head out and…

07:49.052 --> 07:51.346
I get it. But we need to talk.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.015
Yeah.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.268
Yeah, I know. I'm… I'm sorry.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.312
I know it was your day too.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.940
And I wouldn't blame you
if you want to call the whole thing off.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.195
You know, my problem is…

08:07.362 --> 08:09.823
I'd want to marry you
even if you did kidnap that kid.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.961
Go to the flat and I'll meet you there.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.465
Then we can talk about this properly
in private.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.760
If you need to speak to me,
then just call me on my old number.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.394
What exactly did they take?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.854
Every communication device.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.024
-Yeah. Including my Xbox.
-Do you know what they were looking for?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.359
No. Why would I?

08:45.859 --> 08:46.944
They didn't say anything?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.362
-Like what?
-I don't know.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.490
I don't. All right? I don't know.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.825
Son.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.623
-I don't know anything.
-They can't do this.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.292
They can't just kidnap you
and make you look like a criminal.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.086
Your name's all over the Internet.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.462
Shit.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.382
Obviously, they haven't got any evidence,
or you wouldn't be here.

09:09.758 --> 09:10.759
Would he?

09:11.260 --> 09:12.344
We should make a complaint.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.012
Could sue, you know?

09:14.096 --> 09:16.098
-Yeah. Get compensation.
-No.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.810
No, I'd just rather
we all forget about this.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.436
I don't want any more trouble, all right?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.313
It was a mistake.
It could've happened to anyone.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.982
-Yeah, especially anyone brown, innit?
-Yeah.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.358
It never happened to me.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.360
This kind of thing doesn't happen
to people who work hard,

09:28.443 --> 09:30.362
who are satisfied with what they have.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.875
You still got one of those company shirts
for me?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.760
…to contact law enforcement immediately.

09:53.844 --> 09:58.891
Do not approach under any circumstances.
He's known to be extremely dangerous.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.020
He may be in Europe,
but is accustomed to moving around

10:03.103 --> 10:05.522
and is believed to be using
the name Sean Tilson.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.149
Does he have political links?

10:07.232 --> 10:08.984
Is "the truth"
connected to the ambassador job?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.110
...made in the UK?

10:10.194 --> 10:12.029
Can you tell us what is happening?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.823
I'm not gonna comment on
any online speculation.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.994
What we will say is that
we are liaising with UK law enforcement

10:19.077 --> 10:20.746
about several persons of interest.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.583
-You okay?
-Yeah.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.960
Fine.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.798
Good to go.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.180
Business as usual.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.264
Yeah.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.525
I wish you lot put as much creativity
into your essays.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.446
Tara.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.497
I rather hoped you'd visit first thing.
I've been calling you.

11:04.039 --> 11:07.459
The vice-chancellor's office have been
asking me for assurances.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.379
Your name is being linked
with a kidnapping

11:10.462 --> 11:11.922
and, therefore, so is ours.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.467
The police questioned every British guest
at the hotel that night.

11:15.551 --> 11:16.885
I was released without charge.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.390
You don't actually think
I had something to do with this?

11:21.890 --> 11:24.309
We both know how you felt about
Leo Newman's admission.

11:24.393 --> 11:28.772
I-- I said I'd accept the findings of
the investigation and I did.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.650
You also volunteered to go to New York.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.277
And do you know how much I regret that?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.075
You're right.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.035
I'm no fan of Katherine Newman,

11:42.119 --> 11:44.663
but as a mother,
I can't imagine what she's going through.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.208
The chatter about me will disappear

11:48.292 --> 11:52.254
as soon as somebody films
a dog barking a Mariah Carey song.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.547
I hope so.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.633
Because any more reputational damage and…

12:01.054 --> 12:03.015
Nobody's more important
than the college, Tara.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.517
We'd also ask,
if anybody has seen this man,

12:47.059 --> 12:49.228
to contact law enforcement immediately.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.355
Do not approach under any circumstances.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.982
He's known to be extremely dangerous.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.361
He may be in Europe,
but is accustomed to moving around

12:57.945 --> 13:01.031
and is believed
to be using the name Sean Tilson.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.325
Does he have political links?

13:03.408 --> 13:05.702
Is "the truth"
connected to the ambassador job?

13:05.786 --> 13:08.372
Is it true that
there have already been arrests in the UK?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.124
I'm not gonna comment
on any online speculation.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.962
What we will say is that we are liaising
with UK law enforcement

13:15.045 --> 13:16.547
about several persons of interest.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.969
If anybody saw anything or knows anything,

13:22.511 --> 13:24.638
please contact the authorities.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.015
We want Leo back.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.060
How was your chat?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.311
What's that?

13:31.395 --> 13:32.646
With Katherine Newman.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.815
That is who you sneak off
to update, isn't it?

13:34.898 --> 13:36.733
I don't sneak.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.361
But, yes, actually,
I did talk to Miss Newman.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.654
And to my boss.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.031
Did you ask her what "the truth" is?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.702
-Yeah, if only it were that simple.
-Huh.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.789
Working theory is,
given the masks and the Senate stunt,

13:50.873 --> 13:52.791
is that it is connected
to the ambassadorship.

13:53.959 --> 13:54.960
In what way?

13:55.669 --> 13:56.879
I can't tell you that.

13:59.173 --> 14:00.340
'Cause I don't know.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.344
Anything else you do know that I should?

14:07.055 --> 14:09.183
Voice analysis came back
from the kidnap demand.

14:09.266 --> 14:13.854
It's an edit of multiple voices layered
together sampled off the Internet, so…

14:14.563 --> 14:17.149
More Leo sightings from Midtown to Mexico.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.650
Yeah, they're still coming in here too.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.112
Any attempt to communicate
with each other yet?

14:22.196 --> 14:24.823
I doubt there will be,
after your news conference.

14:27.951 --> 14:31.663
You know, not knowing each other
does not mean they're not a gang.

14:31.747 --> 14:34.917
I've seen cases where each kidnapper
has an individual brief

14:35.000 --> 14:37.794
that they carry out without even knowing
what the other ones are doing.

14:38.504 --> 14:42.257
So the mask could be about hiding
from each other as much as from us.

14:42.341 --> 14:43.759
Thompson's moving.

14:49.890 --> 14:53.393
Tango two in Brixton Market.
I have eyes on.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.044
So, you know what my job is?

15:19.962 --> 15:21.964
I help companies be more…

15:22.881 --> 15:23.882
tax efficient.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.426
You help them avoid paying their dues.

15:28.262 --> 15:33.308
Well, I…
I took some of those efficiencies,

15:33.392 --> 15:34.852
and I moved them into a new fund.

15:37.688 --> 15:38.689
My fund.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.525
-You stole?
-No.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.986
-So it was your money?
-No.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.445
So you stole?

15:46.864 --> 15:47.990
It wasn't their money either.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.826
Just because they stole it legally
doesn't mean it's not still stealing.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.411
That's your argument?

15:55.330 --> 15:58.500
I didn't think they would miss
a few grand.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.043
What's a few?

16:00.127 --> 16:03.005
A few hundred.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.132
Nat.

16:05.883 --> 16:06.884
Maybe 400.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.303
Are you for real?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.722
You're supposed to be the sensible one.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.268
So, who's texting?

16:16.768 --> 16:19.980
I don't know.
I mean, I've never met them.

16:20.063 --> 16:23.150
When Nemus, the client,
found out about the missing money,

16:23.233 --> 16:25.068
they said if I paid back
double what I took

16:25.152 --> 16:27.321
by shifting it from other accounts,
then we could all move on.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.741
Most of it's electronic,
the last few were cash drops.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.536
New York was supposed to be the last one,
but my contact didn't show up.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.206
So, this has nothing to do
with the kidnap?

16:41.043 --> 16:42.044
Just tell me where the money is.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.545
-Is it in there?
-No.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.048
You think you can just give it back,
and that'll be it?

16:46.131 --> 16:48.550
This ain't a sherbet fountain, Nat.
Shit's on the news.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.302
What if the police are watching you?

16:51.178 --> 16:53.472
What other choice have I got, Mon?

16:54.431 --> 16:56.725
Please, get me the money.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.397
Okay.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.816
Yeah?

17:06.234 --> 17:07.236
Okay.

17:07.319 --> 17:11.949
Meet me outside my office in an hour.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.575
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.063
Where's the little sister gone?

17:43.689 --> 17:45.649
-They split up.
-Stay on Natalie.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.150
No. Track the sister too.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.247
Tell the truth, Katherine,

18:00.873 --> 18:06.044
or your son dies
with the whole world watching. Tell…

18:06.128 --> 18:08.380
I thought you were gonna do
some proper work today?

18:08.463 --> 18:09.715
-Yeah, man. I am.
-All right.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.341
Well, come on then, Your Highness.
Give us a hand.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.426
All right.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.724
I know you think that carpets
are beneath you.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.059
Carpets are usually beneath you.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.145
Let me tell you something.
Just imagine yourself, yeah,

18:23.228 --> 18:25.147
curled up on the floor with your kids,
yeah?

18:25.230 --> 18:27.399
You're watching a film
on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.444
Or, you know, you're making love
to your wife in front of a roaring fire.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.362
I mean, not in our house, obviously.
But the point is,

18:32.446 --> 18:36.366
it's not carpets that we are selling here,
it's dreams.

18:36.950 --> 18:40.078
You think you're so different,
wanting to give your family a better life?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.789
Dad, yeah,
built this place up from nothing.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.791
Just so you know,
he got up at dawn every day,

18:44.875 --> 18:47.503
he stayed open late every night,
just so he could show us

18:48.086 --> 18:50.756
that we could be anybody, do anything.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.966
This is an opportunity for you, man.

18:55.969 --> 18:56.970
Don't blow it.

19:05.521 --> 19:08.357
Hi, this is Steve McAllister.
Leave a message, please.

19:08.941 --> 19:11.026
Hi. It's me, again.

19:11.777 --> 19:13.320
Please answer your phone, Steve.

19:13.946 --> 19:15.739
I really need to speak to Daisy.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.324
I'll keep trying.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.079
Thanks, Heather.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.508
Did they mention the college?

19:35.425 --> 19:36.426
Yeah.

20:14.256 --> 20:18.677
I know you think you're looking
at a carpet, but we don't sell carpets.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.262
-We sell dreams.
-Aadesh Chopra?

20:20.846 --> 20:23.974
-What?
-Do you know what "the truth" is, Aadesh?

20:26.310 --> 20:29.104
-How did you find me?
-Can I get a picture with you?

20:29.188 --> 20:30.731
-What for?
-I've got this blog.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.774
It's really popular.
About conspiracy theories.

20:32.858 --> 20:35.194
I don't know anything, right?
It's a big mistake.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.362
-No, no, no, no. Not here.
-Well, it'll just take a second.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.156
Yeah, but I'm working, all right? I'll…

20:39.907 --> 20:41.325
Listen, I'll come out.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.534
-Okay?
-When?

20:43.493 --> 20:45.621
-Later, okay? Later.
-Okay. Cool, cool.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.413
Doors closing.

21:37.256 --> 21:38.715
Doors opening.

22:01.864 --> 22:04.283
Natalie. We weren't expecting to see you.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.034
Is Giles in?

22:06.118 --> 22:08.245
No, sorry. He's with a client all morning.

22:10.289 --> 22:11.290
I tried to call.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.835
-Well, like I say, he's--
-Avoiding me. Yeah, I get it.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.256
I suppose I was wondering
if I still have a job.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.924
I think that's an HR matter now.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.219
Wow. Really?

22:26.597 --> 22:27.639
Where's my computer?

22:27.723 --> 22:30.601
Well, the police came and took
pretty much everything of yours.

22:34.771 --> 22:38.025
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I-- This is so humiliating. Can I--

22:39.067 --> 22:40.819
Can I just sit down, please?

22:44.156 --> 22:45.699
I suppose, just for a minute.

22:48.285 --> 22:49.745
Do you want some water?

22:51.288 --> 22:52.623
Can I get a coffee

22:53.707 --> 22:55.375
with lots of milk and sugar, please?

22:56.460 --> 22:58.212
I'll be okay. I just need a minute.

22:58.921 --> 22:59.922
Of course.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.327
Here it is.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.003
What have you been up to, Natalie?

24:22.004 --> 24:23.422
What are we waiting for?

24:23.505 --> 24:24.506
Bring her in.

24:56.038 --> 24:58.832
I'm just leaving Giles a message.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.084
Hope that's okay.

25:08.634 --> 25:10.177
I'm really sorry for earlier.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.054
But I have to go.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.433
Bitch.

26:12.781 --> 26:14.658
Natalie Thompson.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.877
Going on a proper coffee run.

26:26.211 --> 26:29.548
Isn't that a bit beneath ya?
As like, you know, for a prince?

26:29.631 --> 26:30.757
You want something?

26:31.758 --> 26:33.552
-My Xbox.
-So that's a "no"?

26:34.720 --> 26:36.138
-Are you paying?
-No.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.183
Yes, then. It's a "no."

26:48.650 --> 26:49.651
Yeah, that's him!

26:49.735 --> 26:52.362
-Aadesh! Aadesh!
-Can we get a picture together?

27:26.855 --> 27:30.776
I need you to call my sister. Sorry.
No, my mum. Tell her to call Monique.

27:30.859 --> 27:31.818
Why?

27:32.778 --> 27:35.405
Because I'm meant to be
meeting Monique now.

27:36.156 --> 27:37.157
On the South Bank.

27:39.826 --> 27:40.827
Shit.

27:40.911 --> 27:43.205
I think we should talk.
Come this way, please.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.508
-Who texts?
-I don't know.

27:54.591 --> 27:55.717
Well, what does he look like?

27:55.801 --> 27:57.302
-I've never seen him.
-Natalie.

27:57.386 --> 27:59.638
-I haven't.
-How does this relate to Leo Newman?

27:59.721 --> 28:02.349
No, I'm not saying anything else
until I know Monique's safe.

28:03.642 --> 28:04.726
Please.

28:23.829 --> 28:25.163
You're supposed to phone ahead.

28:26.874 --> 28:28.333
I left messages.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.085
And I called you back. At work.

28:30.919 --> 28:31.962
They weren't sure where you were.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.717
-You've been sacked?
-Suspended. Can I see Daisy, please?

28:36.800 --> 28:38.385
Do you know what this is doing to her?

28:38.468 --> 28:40.137
That's why I'm here.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.306
Mum?

28:42.389 --> 28:44.099
Hi, sweetheart.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.101
Come here.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.481
We tried to get to you.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.817
Sorry, babe. I lost my phone.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.111
You mean, the police kept it.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.910
I know the other kids are probably
saying things about me.

29:03.493 --> 29:04.745
I don't care about them.

29:05.579 --> 29:07.539
I wish I could make this all go away.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.791
And it will, honestly.

29:10.626 --> 29:13.253
You know, it's actually kinda cool.
Like, you're famous.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.256
Daisy's got homework to do. So…

29:16.340 --> 29:18.759
-She only just got here.
-It's all right.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.761
Okay.

29:22.763 --> 29:26.016
Whatever you hear or read, I promise you,

29:26.099 --> 29:28.769
I've done nothing to be ashamed of. Okay?

29:30.479 --> 29:31.563
Okay.

29:43.325 --> 29:44.284
Please don't go.

29:49.039 --> 29:50.666
I'll call you later, okay?

30:05.848 --> 30:06.932
It's got to be Tilson.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.517
-There's no doubt about it.
-Even if it is,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.352
-we don't have proper controls in place.
-We have eyes.

30:10.435 --> 30:12.145
We have three officers and no backup.

30:12.229 --> 30:14.439
Monique has zero protection.
She hasn't consented.

30:14.523 --> 30:15.858
She's involved in illegal activity.

30:15.941 --> 30:17.067
We don't know that.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.277
We have clearance for surveillance,

30:18.360 --> 30:21.738
-not to use her as bait for psychopaths.
-She is leading us right to him.

30:21.822 --> 30:22.990
If we can get more officers

30:23.073 --> 30:24.408
-down to the scene--
-It'll be too late.

30:29.246 --> 30:30.581
-Nat.
-What…

30:31.290 --> 30:32.416
What are you doing here?

30:32.499 --> 30:34.418
-Sorry, could you just give us a minute?
-Yeah.

30:36.503 --> 30:37.504
Your mum called me.

30:38.297 --> 30:40.757
She was meant to call Monique.
Have either of you spoken to her?

30:40.841 --> 30:42.259
-You need a lawyer.
-Is she okay?

30:42.342 --> 30:43.343
I don't know.

30:44.553 --> 30:45.888
I've been worrying about you.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.266
Look, Nat, this stops here.

30:49.349 --> 30:50.601
Okay?

30:50.684 --> 30:53.020
They can't keep snatching you
off the street.

30:54.146 --> 30:55.355
You can't represent me.

30:56.899 --> 30:58.692
Well, actually, thanks to them, I can,

30:59.568 --> 31:03.488
since we didn't manage
to become related yesterday.

31:05.282 --> 31:09.453
Listen. Did they rearrest you
when they picked you up?

31:12.122 --> 31:14.958
-Joe, you can't stay.
-Uh-uh, don't.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.420
Don't do that.
I'm not leaving, okay? No way.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.967
-What's happening?
-Look, why is my client being held?

31:24.051 --> 31:25.677
He can't actually do this, can he?

31:25.761 --> 31:29.097
Well, if he wants to risk his practice
certificate, that's his call.

31:29.181 --> 31:31.141
Well, that only becomes an issue
if it gets to court,

31:31.225 --> 31:33.852
which it won't,
because you've done nothing wrong.

31:59.378 --> 32:01.505
Sorry, what further inquiries?

32:01.588 --> 32:03.382
Why did you go into work today, Natalie?

32:06.677 --> 32:07.678
Natalie?

32:09.429 --> 32:12.474
To explain to my boss
why my name's all over the Internet.

32:16.103 --> 32:18.480
What would you say if I told you
we know exactly what you did

32:18.564 --> 32:20.148
at the office this morning?

32:21.900 --> 32:23.110
I don't know what you mean.

32:23.193 --> 32:26.154
What if I told you that during our search,
we left several surveillance cameras?

32:29.324 --> 32:30.409
That change your answer?

32:31.118 --> 32:32.327
Why would you do that?

32:32.870 --> 32:34.663
-They can't do that, can they?
-Would it, Natalie?

32:34.746 --> 32:38.000
Look, if you have any actual evidence,
can we get to it, please?

32:38.083 --> 32:39.293
Is that how you wanna do this?

32:39.877 --> 32:41.628
I just need to know my sister's safe.

33:52.282 --> 33:53.992
Do you remember Blue Robin Holdings,

33:54.076 --> 33:55.994
the company
you told us you'd never heard of?

33:56.662 --> 34:00.332
Well, our fraud team did some digging,
and it turns out

34:00.415 --> 34:03.919
that the director of that company,
one "Madeleine Crofts,"

34:04.002 --> 34:07.214
has a birth date made of exactly
the same digits as yours,

34:07.297 --> 34:09.591
-used in a different order.
-Do you want me to stop this?

34:09.675 --> 34:12.094
Blue Robin Holdings is a shell company,
isn't it, Natalie?

34:12.177 --> 34:14.804
And you've been embezzling money
belonging to Nemus Group

34:14.888 --> 34:16.806
for a period of at least two years.

34:17.808 --> 34:19.560
Tell me she's okay,
and I'll tell you everything.

34:22.187 --> 34:25.858
I need some time alone with my client.

34:27.192 --> 34:29.235
Monique is safe,
and she's on her way here.

34:29.319 --> 34:31.029
How do I know you're telling the truth?

34:31.947 --> 34:35.409
She was carrying a large amount of cash
in US dollars

34:35.492 --> 34:37.953
-and a burner phone.
-I'd like to suspend this interview.

34:38.036 --> 34:40.205
She has nothing to do with this.
You can't arrest her.

34:40.289 --> 34:42.291
-So start talking.
-Stop talking.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.960
Joe, I told you not to stay.

34:45.043 --> 34:48.297
Natalie, whatever's happened,
I know it's not your fault.

34:48.380 --> 34:52.176
Okay? Now, I've said
I'd like to suspend this interview now.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.760
Is that what you want, Natalie?

34:54.636 --> 34:56.346
You know, you can have your lawyer leave.

34:59.224 --> 35:00.601
If that's what you want.

35:04.646 --> 35:05.647
Yeah.

35:08.150 --> 35:09.776
I want him to leave.

35:10.986 --> 35:11.987
Good.

35:13.197 --> 35:14.198
Natalie.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.528
Is she really safe?

35:58.742 --> 36:00.994
You had to know who owns the largest stake

36:01.078 --> 36:03.038
in the company
you were stealing from, right?

36:04.790 --> 36:06.291
Cooper Newman PR.

36:06.375 --> 36:09.503
Owned by Katherine Newman,
mother of Leo Newman.

36:09.586 --> 36:10.921
I didn't know that.

36:11.588 --> 36:14.007
I swear, I'm telling the truth.
I didn't know any of that.

36:14.091 --> 36:16.927
Do you know what "the truth" is, Natalie?

36:19.680 --> 36:22.307
Do you know the last time we closed early?

36:22.391 --> 36:24.601
-Never.
-Never.

36:24.685 --> 36:29.398
And then you finally
come to work with us for one day,

36:30.023 --> 36:31.775
and the company's reputation is ruined.

36:33.151 --> 36:37.072
It's not ruined.
I mean, all publicity is good publicity,

36:37.656 --> 36:38.866
in a way.

36:38.949 --> 36:43.412
You are unreliable,
and you are untrustworthy.

36:47.749 --> 36:49.877
Maybe we should move out for a bit,

36:51.044 --> 36:52.838
give everyone a chance to calm down?

36:55.632 --> 36:58.635
Maybe I can call Nari,
see if we can stay at hers for a few days.

37:11.064 --> 37:12.482
I'm not coming, Aadesh.

37:18.197 --> 37:20.073
I'm not leaving with you.

37:23.702 --> 37:25.537
But you're my wife.

37:28.165 --> 37:29.166
I'm sorry.

37:30.584 --> 37:31.793
Hey.

37:33.128 --> 37:34.129
Hey.

37:35.047 --> 37:38.509
I know what your family means to you.
I get it.

37:38.592 --> 37:39.968
But I promise--

37:40.052 --> 37:41.595
No more promises.

37:42.221 --> 37:43.222
Please.

37:44.598 --> 37:45.599
You don't keep them.

37:49.436 --> 37:52.523
I can fix this, Sonia.

37:54.191 --> 37:56.693
The truth will come out.

37:56.777 --> 37:58.195
The truth is…

38:00.656 --> 38:02.866
This was never gonna be enough
for you, was it?

38:13.794 --> 38:14.837
I can fix this.

39:28.243 --> 39:29.453
Mon?

39:29.536 --> 39:30.704
Mon?

39:31.538 --> 39:33.999
Mon. Mon, are you all right?
What happened?

39:35.209 --> 39:38.003
Mon, please, please, just talk to me.
What happened, Mon?

39:43.634 --> 39:44.635
Mon.

39:53.936 --> 39:55.020
It was the right call.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.439
We coulda got Tilson.

39:57.981 --> 40:00.526
While you are worrying about procedure,

40:00.609 --> 40:04.947
there is a real-life kid and his mother
wondering how long he has left to live.

40:07.491 --> 40:10.118
You honestly think I care less
about finding Leo than you do?

40:13.705 --> 40:17.417
If nothing else, the sooner he's found,
the sooner you get back on that plane.

40:35.978 --> 40:37.771
Tell him your sister
thought she was being tailed.

40:37.855 --> 40:40.607
-What?
-Same language you always use, no codes.

40:43.527 --> 40:44.570
Let me talk to Monique.

40:44.653 --> 40:46.572
Natalie,
you are not in a position to negotiate.

40:46.655 --> 40:49.241
Please, just let me talk to Monique,

40:49.324 --> 40:50.659
and I'll do whatever you want.

40:53.787 --> 40:54.788
Okay.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.632
How fast does he reply, usually?

41:05.716 --> 41:06.717
Straightaway.

41:07.259 --> 41:09.052
He only turns the phone on when he texts.

41:11.054 --> 41:13.640
Tell him you still have the cash,
and you'll meet him tomorrow.

42:00.854 --> 42:01.897
Two minutes.

42:10.906 --> 42:12.324
Is your room bigger than mine?

42:17.246 --> 42:19.414
I was so worried.
What the hell were you thinking?

42:20.999 --> 42:22.167
It was for me, wasn't it?

42:24.127 --> 42:26.088
You stole the money
to send me to school in America.

42:27.506 --> 42:28.632
It wasn't stealing.

42:28.715 --> 42:29.800
Didn't you?

42:36.682 --> 42:38.725
When you got the chance to go,

42:39.393 --> 42:41.311
I was so proud of you.

42:41.395 --> 42:42.729
And I still am.

42:43.730 --> 42:46.066
And I wasn't gonna let
anything as petty as money

42:46.149 --> 42:49.236
stop you from showing the world
how amazing you are.

42:49.319 --> 42:52.781
Plus, you'd be living on a different
continent, so… win-win.

42:55.534 --> 42:56.869
Is that the reason you went today?

42:59.121 --> 43:02.165
You always used to
accuse me of copying. Well…

43:02.916 --> 43:05.335
No. No, this is all on me.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.921
You're not gonna get charged.
Everything's gonna be okay.

43:09.131 --> 43:10.132
Does Mum know?

43:12.092 --> 43:13.552
Only that I pay.

43:13.635 --> 43:16.638
She seems to think
that South London finance managers

43:16.722 --> 43:19.474
make the same as City traders.

43:20.851 --> 43:23.520
I guess we all believe
what we want to in the end, don't we?

43:26.523 --> 43:27.983
Okay. Let's go.

43:29.735 --> 43:31.445
Just sit tight.

43:31.528 --> 43:32.863
Everything's gonna be all right.

43:35.449 --> 43:36.450
You'll see.

43:54.801 --> 43:55.802
Hey.

43:55.886 --> 43:56.887
New development.

44:05.103 --> 44:07.022
Seems we may have a fifth.

44:07.105 --> 44:09.024
We have a car hired at the airport

44:09.107 --> 44:11.360
on the day of the kidnap
by one "Eddie Walker."

44:12.194 --> 44:15.822
His debit card was used in a bar
near the hotel just hours before.

44:27.835 --> 44:28.836
Eddie Walker?

44:29.795 --> 44:31.421
-Yeah?
-Come with us, please.

44:31.505 --> 44:32.631
What is this about?

44:32.714 --> 44:34.049
-Just come with us, please.
-You're not serious?

44:34.132 --> 44:36.176
Okay, I'm coming.
Don't touch me, all right?

44:38.804 --> 44:40.222
Is this about Leo Newman?

44:40.305 --> 44:42.349
Guess where Mr. Walker is a student?
