WEBVTT

00:05.918 --> 00:08.138
- Any chance of getting
this thing running again?

00:08.182 --> 00:10.662
- The simplicity
of the thermosiphon cooling

00:10.706 --> 00:12.229
is sheer elegance.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.188
The capitalist dictate
of constant improvement

00:14.231 --> 00:16.320
often pushes us past
the pinnacle of achievement

00:16.364 --> 00:18.540
into inferior products.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.368
- And this is your brain
off of drugs?

00:20.411 --> 00:22.935
- Hey, don't weed-shame me.
I know stuff.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.415
- Okay, so is that a yes?

00:24.459 --> 00:25.851
Because soon enough,
someone's gonna see

00:25.895 --> 00:27.331
that J. Edgar Hoover's missing

00:27.375 --> 00:28.680
and the timeline's
gonna start changing.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.030
- If I can find some water,
yes.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.727
- Oh! Uh, Gary,

00:31.770 --> 00:33.337
can you check the back seat
for some water please?

00:33.381 --> 00:34.860
I think I saw something
under Hoover's coat.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.341
-
Please don't mention his name.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.691
This guy's giving me
terrible indigestion.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.954
- That's probably
all the cigars. Ugh.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.087
- Or all the bigotry.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.655
- Oh!

00:47.264 --> 00:50.702
Uh, we've got some soda.
Does that work?

00:50.746 --> 00:53.879
- We'll find out.
- Oh, how about this?

00:53.923 --> 00:56.056
A radio.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.059
- Oh, we can pick up
some newscasts.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.715
<i>The lovely and
lethal Bullet Blondes</i>

01:03.759 --> 01:05.587
<i>remain at large,</i>

01:05.630 --> 01:07.937
<i>last seen driving east
on the Bankhead Highway.</i>

01:07.980 --> 01:09.591
<i>Caution advised.</i>

01:09.634 --> 01:11.723
<i>They are considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

01:11.767 --> 01:13.725
- Huh, I can't believe
the name stuck.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.118
- Yeah, and they didn't
mention Hoover,

01:15.162 --> 01:17.251
which means they think
he's still alive.

01:17.294 --> 01:19.079
- Yeah. Well, he's not.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.864
- Wha...

01:23.648 --> 01:25.259
Hey. What's up?

01:25.302 --> 01:27.261
We've gotten out
of tighter spots than this.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.784
- Have we?

01:28.827 --> 01:30.786
Mick's gone.
Astra's down for the count.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.919
Zari is nursing a broken heart
in a pocket dimension,

01:33.963 --> 01:36.574
and I killed J. Edgar Hoover.
- And it was an accident.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.620
And it could have happened
to any man of steel.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.012
- That's not funny.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.014
I spent my whole life
studying history

01:42.058 --> 01:43.973
and making sure
it's preserved and passed on.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.496
By killing Hoover,

01:45.540 --> 01:47.455
I personally messed up
the entire 20th century.

01:47.498 --> 01:48.804
- Look,
we're gonna fix it, okay?

01:48.847 --> 01:50.153
- Are we?

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
Because without Gideon
or the ship,

01:51.676 --> 01:53.243
there's no way you can
guarantee that.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.767
- Nate, you are spinning.
- I murdered a man, Sara.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.422
And for the first time
in our lives,

01:58.466 --> 02:01.121
we have to accept that
that could be permanent.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.297
- Okay, look--
- Uh, wife? Nate?

02:03.340 --> 02:04.776
We got a big problem.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.169
Hoover was supposed
to be on a train

02:06.213 --> 02:07.866
to New York from Midland
this afternoon.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.347
- If he's not there,
the whole timeline's screwed.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.610
- No, it won't be.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.178
Nate, history needs saving,

02:15.222 --> 02:17.267
and you are
just the man to do it.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.487
So long as the world thinks
that Hoover is still alive,

02:19.530 --> 02:21.532
then the timeline
remains on track.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.621
- No, no, no.
I know what you're thinking.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.145
No, there's no way
I can impersonate Hoover

02:25.188 --> 02:26.798
all the way to New York.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.583
I could barely do it
in some Podunk Texas town.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.977
- Gary!
- Huh?

02:32.021 --> 02:35.372
- Can you do some kind of spell
and make him look like Hoover?

02:35.416 --> 02:37.809
- Uh,

02:37.853 --> 02:40.638
technically, yes.
But, um...

02:40.682 --> 02:43.989
I'd need some of
Hoover's spit or fingernails...

02:49.038 --> 02:52.084
- Or hair.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.871
- We're mobile, people.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.394
- Well, good.

02:57.438 --> 03:01.311
Because J. Edgar Hoover has
a train to catch.

03:04.358 --> 03:11.365
<i>â™ª</i>

03:25.248 --> 03:28.251
- I did a spell
to resurrect a machine.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.861
I don't know what this is.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.734
- I'd recognize that smug
little smile anywhere.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.518
It is Gideon.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.346
- She doesn't look
like a machine.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.044
- Well, not a machine
exactly, Mami.

03:39.088 --> 03:42.352
A computer who speaks.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.788
Usually.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.269
- Hello, computer.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.229
- Well, on the upside,

03:49.272 --> 03:50.969
looks like you got
your magic working again.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.929
- My magic is clearly garbage.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.278
Stop that.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.976
- She's still Gideon
though, right?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.108
What's two plus two?

04:01.415 --> 04:04.069
There you go.

04:07.159 --> 04:10.467
Wow, computers are--are
very exciting.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.731
- Uh--sorry.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.566
- Is it ready?
- Not yet.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.568
It needs to fully ferment.
This is just the primary stage.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.178
- Okay, well,
we need to come up

04:26.222 --> 04:27.571
with some kind of distraction
or something,

04:27.615 --> 04:28.659
because that train leaves
in five minutes,

04:28.703 --> 04:30.270
and Hoover needs to be on it.

04:30.313 --> 04:33.098
- And to the public eye,
he will be.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.970
Look, because they're not
gonna be looking at him.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.624
No. They--
- What are you doing?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.278
- Are going to be looking

04:38.321 --> 04:41.411
at the most wanted women
in America.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.283
- What?

04:43.326 --> 04:45.285
- Oh, I'm not sure about this.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.157
- Just follow my lead. Come on.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.333
- My safe word
is core competency.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.946
- Coming through here.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.644
Look out,
we got the Bullet Blondes.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.123
- This isn't the last
you're gonna hear

04:58.167 --> 04:59.603
of the Bullet Blondes.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.039
- That's right, coppers.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.432
- Who you calling the cops?

05:02.476 --> 05:03.825
We're the Bureau
of Investigation.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.522
- That's right,

05:05.566 --> 05:07.132
and J. Edgar Hoover
always gets his man. Or woman.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.831
Or gender non-conforming
individual.

05:09.874 --> 05:13.138
- I need four extra tickets
for my associates.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.793
- Are those the Bullet Blondes?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.795
- Well, we're not a pair
of canceled stamps.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.623
- Pleasure.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.017
- Mr. Hoover, let me find some
seats for you and your men.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.504
Our most secure cabin
is the honeymoon suite.

05:34.856 --> 05:38.468
In the name of J. Edgar Hoover,
I'm commandeering this cabin.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.644
- Oh, no.
No need to commandeer.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.342
We don't want to spoil
your honeymoon.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.344
- Spoil? Phonus balonus.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.997
- Well, after them
Palmer raids,

05:46.041 --> 05:48.391
we'd be proud to help out
a patriot like Mr. Hoover.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.355
- Squeeze on by here.
- Congratulations.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.357
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, best wishes.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.059
- Whew. That was close.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.235
- Can you please
take these off now?

06:07.715 --> 06:09.369
- What are the Palmer raids?

06:09.412 --> 06:10.718
- After World War I,

06:10.761 --> 06:13.373
America was freaking out
about Communism,

06:13.416 --> 06:17.377
so Hoover and the DOJ arrested
thousands of immigrants,

06:17.420 --> 06:20.249
union workers, anything that
smelled like organized labor.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.382
- Real champion
of civil liberties.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.296
- Oh, he pretty much codified
racial bias

06:24.340 --> 06:25.863
into our judicial system.

06:25.907 --> 06:29.127
Okay, look, morally,
he's repulsive.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.521
Historically, however,

06:31.565 --> 06:34.045
he's one of the most important
men of the 20th century.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.700
He founded the FBI.
He ran it till he died.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.747
- Yeah, well, great men
aren't usually good guys, so.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.055
And that is our cue
to disappear.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.449
Oh, B, key me.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.103
- The key.

06:48.146 --> 06:51.193
Time Bureau manual
and some honeymoon chocolates.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.761
Say hi to Z for me.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.903
- Capi-tans, hey.

07:05.947 --> 07:09.167
Are we home yet?
How did your bank robbery go?

07:09.211 --> 07:11.561
Did we find out who blew up
the Waverider yet or no?

07:11.605 --> 07:13.955
Am I talking too much?
Am I talking not too much?

07:13.998 --> 07:16.174
- I think she's a little high.
- I'd say very.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.002
- We're still in 1925.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.961
- And now, we are on a train.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.442
- What? Where are we going?

07:23.791 --> 07:26.750
But really where is
anybody really going?

07:26.794 --> 07:29.449
- You okay, Z?
I thought you didn't partake.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.102
- No, no, no.

07:31.146 --> 07:34.758
I know, but you see
I found myself on a journey.

07:34.802 --> 07:38.762
And that journey is
with these tiny, little bears.

07:38.806 --> 07:42.244
And I'm going on that journey
a la carte.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.294
A la carte.
"Allah" carte.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.513
- Okay.
Well, we'll be upstairs.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.123
- Yeah, if you need anything,

07:52.167 --> 07:53.821
please don't hesitate
to come and find us.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.997
Actually, hesitate a little.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.304
- Oh, hesitate a lot.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.785
- Ew, that's gross, moms.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.792
- Hey, maybe
we won't even need that potion.

08:08.836 --> 08:09.793
We just hide out in the cabin.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.318
- You in there, Speed?

08:13.362 --> 08:15.407
- Speed?
- That was Hoover's nickname.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.018
Only his closest friends
call him that.

08:17.061 --> 08:20.804
- It's Francis Baker.
Junior, of course.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.415
Oh, the GW boys
are gonna go wild

08:23.459 --> 08:25.026
when I tell them I saw you.

08:25.069 --> 08:28.246
- Gary, potion.
- Uh, it's frothing and ready.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.510
- All right.
How long does the spell last?

08:30.553 --> 08:32.033
- Uh, it depends
upon your metabolism.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.817
Could be an hour. Could be 24.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.994
- Hey, it sounds like Hoover
was a supreme douche.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.344
You really sure
you want to be him?

08:39.388 --> 08:41.259
- I have to clean up
my mess, B.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.264
- No, but wait. Wait.
Don't drink it in front of us.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.184
- Did it work?
- We don't know.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.838
Since you drank it
in front of us, we'll only know

08:54.882 --> 08:56.231
if the magic works
when someone else sees you.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.668
- Oh, for the love of...

08:58.712 --> 09:00.540
<i>- This is silly.</i>

09:00.583 --> 09:02.716
<i>Let me see your...</i>

09:04.413 --> 09:05.545
face.

09:08.243 --> 09:11.289
Edgar.
There's that handsome look.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.078
<i>â™ª</i>

09:21.648 --> 09:23.606
- Let me buy you lunch, Speed.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.566
The oysters here give
Old Ebbitt's a run

09:26.609 --> 09:27.697
for their money.

09:35.618 --> 09:39.230
Director of the Bureau
of Investigation at 29.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.581
Speed indeed.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.626
I think you fellows
will be

09:43.670 --> 09:46.150
more comfortable elsewhere.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.593
- Yeah. Sure.
More comfortable.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.736
- Ew.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.434
No thank you.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.088
- She made a little doll.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.786
- I wish the Legends
would just get back already.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.178
They would know exactly
what to do with her

10:14.222 --> 10:16.180
and her creepy
outsider apple art.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.269
They can't find this
Dr. Davies guy soon enough.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.100
- Oh.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.363
- Gideon!

10:25.407 --> 10:29.324
- Great.
Now she's broken.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.550
- Hey. You okay?

10:41.162 --> 10:42.859
- Yeah. Why?

10:42.903 --> 10:44.644
- Oh, man.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.123
Are you mad that we're
honeymooning in your house,

10:46.167 --> 10:47.516
after everything
that happened with John or--

10:47.559 --> 10:51.955
- Shh. Aves, I love you.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.696
I love you both.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.655
I love your love.

10:55.698 --> 10:58.179
I love that you're loving
each other right now,

10:58.222 --> 11:00.660
even if that love is happening
directly above me

11:00.703 --> 11:03.706
while I eat sugar foam.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.665
- Okay.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.492
Well, if you ever want to talk
or anything, just come find--

11:07.536 --> 11:08.842
- No, seriously.

11:08.885 --> 11:14.195
I am A-okay.
I am golden.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.893
- You know what?
Just--just hear me out, Z.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.809
No judgment, okay?
I'm just...

11:19.853 --> 11:21.898
I think you and Behrad
are very different people,

11:21.942 --> 11:24.509
and I think that maybe
your coping mechanisms

11:24.553 --> 11:26.642
might not be the same
as his coping mechanisms.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.819
- You know, honestly,
I'm not sure

11:29.863 --> 11:31.560
that I'm doing
this stoned thing correctly,

11:31.603 --> 11:35.825
because I either feel,
like, very hungry or tired,

11:35.869 --> 11:37.348
all of the time.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.002
That can't be it, can it?
Can that be it?

11:39.046 --> 11:40.830
- I don't know.
You're a doer though.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.179
You know?
You're like me.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.746
- Oh, it's true.
I love a project.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.182
- You love a project.
Let's find you a project.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.837
Ooh, cleaning. Cleaning.
That's a good one.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.447
- I ought to clean this place.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.406
I'ma clean this place.
Clean the John vibes.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.190
- Yes. Yes! That's my girl.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.627
- You know, at minimum,
it will give me an excuse

11:55.671 --> 12:00.110
to leave this room,
because you guys are very loud.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.112
- What?
Come on. We're not loud.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.377
- Core competency.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.465
Boop.

12:09.076 --> 12:12.166
- I don't even know
what you're talking about.

12:26.093 --> 12:29.661
- So tell me.
Is there a Mrs. Hoover?

12:29.705 --> 12:31.315
- Oh, no, ma'am.
I'm married to my job.

12:31.359 --> 12:34.057
- Oh, well,
let me give you my card,

12:34.101 --> 12:36.930
in case you and your job
ever get divorced.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.761
My purse. It's gone.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.501
- Never fear, madam.

12:43.545 --> 12:47.331
You have the nation's finest
detective at your service.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.988
Should we round up
the usual suspects?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.781
- Those are my men.

13:06.046 --> 13:11.921
<i>â™ª</i>

13:11.965 --> 13:16.273
No one is leaving this car,
till we get that purse back.

13:16.317 --> 13:20.103
- Oh!
- Now, what was in your purse?

13:20.147 --> 13:21.844
Jewelry?

13:25.848 --> 13:27.545
Money?

13:30.984 --> 13:33.334
Anything of note?

13:36.163 --> 13:40.645
- Hmm.
My calling card, my comb,

13:40.689 --> 13:42.169
and one of those
delightful pastries

13:42.212 --> 13:44.127
from the breakfast cart.

13:44.171 --> 13:47.174
You never know when you might
get a flash of the grumblies.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.490
- Goldie!

13:59.534 --> 14:02.537
- I believe this is
what you are looking for.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.714
- Huzzah!
- Thank you, Mr. Hoover.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.324
- Hip-hip!
Hooray!

14:07.368 --> 14:09.761
- Thank you.
- Hip-hip!

14:09.805 --> 14:11.459
Hooray.
-

14:14.723 --> 14:16.899
- Um...
-

14:18.205 --> 14:20.511
Well, I must get
back to work.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.078
- If only all of the bad guys

14:22.122 --> 14:24.864
was easy to catch
as Goldie here.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.169
- Marvelous seeing you,

14:26.213 --> 14:28.868
Francis Baker,
Junior, of course. Okay.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.347
It's working.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.175
They're buying it.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.611
- Yeah, they're buying that
Gary and I are petty thieves,

14:33.655 --> 14:35.178
'cause of our looks.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.353
- I'm trying to be as
authentically Hoover

14:36.397 --> 14:38.007
as possible.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.356
- I wouldn't mind a little
less authenticity.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.705
- You understand--
- Hey, whoa.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.403
Why don't we go
back to Plan A?

14:42.446 --> 14:44.361
Hunkering.
- You're right.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.233
We should play it safe,
till we get to New York.

14:53.283 --> 15:00.247
<i>â™ª</i>

15:00.290 --> 15:03.903
- Director Hoover, thank God.
- We just got word from HQ.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.556
There's a plot afoot
to kidnap you.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.602
- We need to get you
off this train.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.781
- Give me a minute.

15:14.609 --> 15:15.958
- I'm sure
we can find a way

15:16.002 --> 15:17.394
to get to New York
that doesn't involve

15:17.438 --> 15:19.919
Hoover cosplay or kidnapping--
- Listen.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.225
The real J. Edgar
Hoover was never kidnapped.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.748
So he must have solved this.
- No.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.750
This is getting
way too out of control.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.404
I mean, I'm sure we can fix
this with a do-over.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.405
- What if
there's no more do-overs?

15:28.449 --> 15:29.798
What if this is it?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.191
We owe it
to history to make it right.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.152
Gentlemen,
this sounds like a case

15:36.196 --> 15:37.762
for the Bureau
of Investigation.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.989
- Has she had
anything to drink?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.251
- She doesn't need
anything to drink.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.166
She's not a person.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.779
- I may not know
what a computer is,

15:54.823 --> 15:57.434
but I know a heartbeat.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.132
And you made that, Astra.

16:01.351 --> 16:04.528
You are not only
a very powerful witch.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.791
You're also a mother now.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.969
- I am nobody's mother.
- Dang.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.623
Now, what will the team do
with a human Gideon?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.712
- Probably just give her
Rory's old room.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.976
There's always space
for one more with the Legends.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.021
- And where are
your Legends now, anyway?

16:19.065 --> 16:21.371
- They went to New York,
to meet this time travel guy.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.765
Once they find him,
they're gonna come get us.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.377
- Okay. I'm no expert,
but seems to me,

16:27.421 --> 16:31.120
if you have a machine
that can travel through time,

16:31.164 --> 16:32.643
wouldn't you just
go back to right

16:32.687 --> 16:36.343
after the moment you left?
I mean, unless...

16:36.386 --> 16:38.171
- It didn't work.

16:42.871 --> 16:47.658
- What was the word from HQ?
- Not a lot of detail.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.270
The Dallas field office
intercepted a telegram.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.492
- "Hoover on tren, northbond."

16:55.536 --> 16:57.233
"Train" and "northbound"
are both misspelled.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.367
- So he's a foreigner.
- Or a bad speller.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.587
- Men in Little Rock
are gonna alert D.C.

17:03.631 --> 17:04.936
Plan to have agents at
every station along the route.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.503
- Good.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.766
- Mr. Hoover says
we're looking for a foreigner.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.551
- I didn't say that.
- Stay put in here, Mr. Hoover.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.031
We'll turn this train
upside-down,

17:12.074 --> 17:14.250
till we find our man.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.557
- Hoover doesn't run
an investigation from behind.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.602
All right.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.169
All we got to go on
is this telegram,

17:20.213 --> 17:22.432
which doesn't give us
a motive or a means.

17:22.476 --> 17:26.262
But its timing does narrow down
the list of possible suspects.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.742
- Donovan, Rodgers.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.396
Get me a list
of all the passengers

17:29.439 --> 17:32.094
that got on this train
since Midland. Go.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.530
On it, sir.

17:33.574 --> 17:34.705
- The three of us
are gonna start

17:34.749 --> 17:36.098
at the front
of the train,

17:36.142 --> 17:37.273
and we're gonna
work our way back.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.535
We're looking for anyone

17:38.579 --> 17:40.450
who has a reason
to hurt Hoover.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.238
- Who would possibly want
to hurt that guy?

17:46.935 --> 17:48.850
- "Please" would have been
nice.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.376
- Is there anyone on this train

17:53.420 --> 17:56.075
you may suspect of having
anti-government sentiment?

17:56.118 --> 17:57.815
- Anti-government?

17:57.859 --> 17:59.730
The government is the only
thing keeping this country

17:59.774 --> 18:01.384
from going to the dogs.

18:01.428 --> 18:04.518
- Have you heard anyone talk
about anarchy or...

18:06.607 --> 18:07.869
socialism?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.437
- Well, that depends.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.744
Would you call
a working wage socialism?

18:13.788 --> 18:16.617
Then yeah. I'd say
we're all talking about it.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.664
- Lovely to see America
by train car.

18:21.665 --> 18:24.146
- Be a lot lovelier
if I wasn't being spied on

18:24.190 --> 18:26.148
by a bunch of dicks.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.933
- By "dick" do you mean cop?
- Hmm.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.283
- Well, you think someone

18:30.326 --> 18:32.589
on this train
is a ne'er-do-well?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.591
Well,
good luck pulling one over

18:34.635 --> 18:36.637
on America's finest law man.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.682
- That's very nice of you.

18:38.726 --> 18:43.122
- Hoover?
That man is cursed.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.863
- You have no idea.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.343
- Hoover?

18:47.387 --> 18:49.128
Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.305
- Ugh, tell me about it.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.178
- Everybody on this train
loves Hoover.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.137
- Yeah, everybody
with first-class tickets.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.183
The people we talked to would
be happy to kill "Hoover."

19:01.227 --> 19:04.012
- If we're looking for motive,
we got it.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.622
Lots of it.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.450
- Yeah, which is as good
as finding none at all.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.148
We're switching
this investigation away

19:09.191 --> 19:12.716
from the "why"
and onto the "how."

19:12.760 --> 19:15.502
And with agents in every city,
it'll be pretty hard

19:15.545 --> 19:17.460
pulling off a kidnapping
in any of the stations.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.809
They'd get caught immediately.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.681
- Or congratulated.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.467
- But if you could get
the train off the main route--

19:24.511 --> 19:26.034
- No one would be
guarding the track.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.210
- And if you can redirect
the train,

19:28.254 --> 19:29.211
you have control of the train.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
- Ooh! Ooh! Inside job.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.997
- Inside job.
- Inside job.

19:33.041 --> 19:36.349
- Director Hoover,
meet Igor Lewandowski.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.741
Train's engineer.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.482
- A Russian
and a labor organizer.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.875
- He wasn't scheduled
to work today,

19:40.918 --> 19:42.311
but had a change of heart.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.921
Joined the crew
back in Midland.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.314
Awfully convenient.

19:45.358 --> 19:46.707
- Did he confess?
- He won't say diddly,

19:46.750 --> 19:48.491
but he's our guy.
I'm sure of it.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.014
Trust you can get the...

19:50.058 --> 19:52.756
confession we need.
Do your worst, boss.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.585
- Yeah.

19:58.458 --> 20:03.506
<i>â™ª</i>

20:03.550 --> 20:04.942
- Oh, boy.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.031
Very sad
party of one happening here.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.511
Doesn't matter.

20:08.555 --> 20:12.298
Zen in ten, here I come.
Starting with the fridge.

20:15.257 --> 20:18.260
See, even I know you don't keep
whiskey in the fridge.

20:21.481 --> 20:28.575
<i>â™ª</i>

20:36.931 --> 20:38.628
Aves.
- Hi, Z.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.369
- How many bottles of whiskey
are there on the table?

20:40.413 --> 20:42.415
- Um, two.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.243
- Two!

20:44.286 --> 20:46.114
The fridge is making whiskey.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.072
- What? That's fantastic.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.901
- The Waverider.
- Yeah?

20:50.945 --> 20:53.774
I guess it's kind of
like the Waverider.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.950
Although the fridge doesn't
take requests like Gideon.

20:55.993 --> 20:58.953
- No, no, no, this bottle--
this bottle is the Waverider.

20:58.996 --> 21:02.565
And this bottle is the mystery
Waverider that blew us up.

21:02.609 --> 21:08.267
So if there's two Waveriders,
who's to say there isn't...

21:10.965 --> 21:13.141
third Waverider?

21:15.622 --> 21:17.798
And a fourth.
It will never end.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.975
- Oh, I get it.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.933
You're still really stoned.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.935
- So--so, let's say we go back
and stop the mystery Waverider

21:24.979 --> 21:26.415
from blowing us up.
That's great.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.199
But that Waverider came
from somewhere.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.592
Which means if one showed up,
then another one could.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.115
And another,
and another, and another.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.335
- Okay. Wait. Let's just
slow this train down.

21:33.379 --> 21:36.120
Take this. Remember this?
Here. Grab this. Hi, hi, hi.

21:36.164 --> 21:39.036
Look, squirt. Squirt, squirt.
Squirt and wipe!

21:39.080 --> 21:41.212
Squirt and wipe, and the
gummies are gonna wear off,

21:41.256 --> 21:42.692
and then you're gonna be

21:42.736 --> 21:44.433
feeling the natural
high of a job well done.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.348
Look. Show me. Show me.
I'm watching.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.002
- Aves, I--
- Squirt and wipe.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.791
- You got this. You got this.
You can be mean.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.619
You can be mean as hell.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.496
- He's all ready for you, sir.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.149
- Good.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.413
- Uh, "sir," quick word?

22:08.501 --> 22:10.241
How are you gonna
swing this, Nate?

22:10.285 --> 22:12.331
- I don't know. I don't want
to hurt the guy, but...

22:12.374 --> 22:13.810
- No way, man.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.638
- Look, those two agents
are expecting Hoover.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.205
- They have all the evidence
they need.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.338
That's more than enough.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.817
- It's not enough.
I need a confession.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.384
- Look, Nate,
I know you feel like this is

22:22.428 --> 22:24.081
the end of the world,

22:24.125 --> 22:26.388
but you're just a good guy
who made a bad mistake.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.259
What was the alternative?
Let him kill you?

22:28.303 --> 22:30.044
You're worth
a thousand Hoovers.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.699
- By comparison to Hoover,
I am nobody in the timeline.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.005
- Come on, Nate.
You know that's not true.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.746
- You've gotta forgive
yourself.

22:39.793 --> 22:44.754
<i>â™ª</i>

22:44.798 --> 22:46.713
- This isn't about me.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.372
- So what are we gonna do?

22:53.415 --> 22:55.199
- You ever hear the one about
the black lady, the brown lady,

22:55.243 --> 22:58.028
and the broken computer
who walked into a bar, in 1925?

22:58.072 --> 22:59.682
- Uh, no.
- Yeah.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.510
Because it would never happen.
Let's face it.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.731
There's nothing we can do.
The Legends are on their own.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.913
Great.
More decapitated apple heads.

23:12.956 --> 23:20.007
<i>â™ª</i>

23:22.749 --> 23:24.751
- I think she's trying to
tell us something, Astra.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.843
An apple a day.
Easy as apple pie.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.629
Don't put
all your apples in one box.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.415
- That is not a thing.
- Okay.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.417
It's six apples in a box,
off the table, on the floor.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.897
- Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
It's clearly apple...

23:45.641 --> 23:46.773
Sauce.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.560
Okay, you know what enough?

23:51.604 --> 23:53.432
Just stop trying
to tell us things.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.563
I wish
I could just shove you back

23:54.607 --> 23:56.086
in the wires,
and the sockets,

23:56.130 --> 23:57.784
or whatever makes you work
on the Waverider,

23:57.827 --> 23:59.786
because then maybe
you could actually help us.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.276
- So why are you so mad
at Gideon?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.191
She hasn't done
anything to you.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.932
- Because...

24:15.976 --> 24:18.805
she's a constant reminder
of my giant failure.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.548
- That's why you don't want
to go after the Legends.

24:23.679 --> 24:27.857
- I'm useless to them, Spooner.
- You made one mistake, Astra.

24:27.901 --> 24:31.731
Ease up on yourself.
At least you still have magic.

24:32.645 --> 24:35.517
- Hey,
you have things to offer too.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.127
- Like what?

24:37.171 --> 24:39.478
Without aliens,
what do I bring to the table?

24:42.176 --> 24:45.222
- Ranch wear?
- Okay. You know what?

24:45.266 --> 24:47.137
I guess we're both
pretty useless.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.661
- You mean
the three of us are...

24:48.704 --> 24:51.185
What is that?

25:00.107 --> 25:01.369
- Gideon, no!

25:11.379 --> 25:15.514
<i>â™ª</i>

25:15.557 --> 25:17.037
Why did you do that?

25:17.080 --> 25:20.214
- Wires and sockets.
She understood you.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.179
- Hey, Z.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.659
Can Sara and I grab one
of those bottles of...

25:30.703 --> 25:33.662
whiskey?
- Oh, hey, girl.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.403
- Hey, buddy.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.405
Uh, what did we talk about?

25:37.448 --> 25:39.581
More cleaning.
No more gummies, yeah?

25:39.625 --> 25:42.018
- Oh, no. I'm not stoned.
I'm enlightened.

25:42.062 --> 25:45.021
See, I finally realize
why John gave me this key.

25:45.065 --> 25:48.024
To clear my head and think
about the bigger picture.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.374
See, I was so focused on
my phones, and skincare sales,

25:50.418 --> 25:52.463
and romantic entanglements
that I never stopped to think

25:52.507 --> 25:55.205
about what was really
going on with the team.

25:55.249 --> 25:58.295
- The team. Our team?
- Yeah.

25:58.339 --> 26:01.734
See, without those distractions
I was able to dig deep

26:01.777 --> 26:04.214
and really think
about how we got here.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.042
So I read your Time Bureau
agent manual earlier.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.784
- What?
That thing's over 200 pages.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.612
- Yeah, and I started thinking,

26:10.656 --> 26:12.701
it's not
about the how they blew us up.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.095
It's about the who.

26:15.138 --> 26:18.315
I made a list of suspects.
Do you want to see?

26:18.359 --> 26:20.579
- Um, yes. Yes I do.
- Great.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.281
- Time to spill the beans,
Lewandowski.

26:31.633 --> 26:32.808
- What'd you say?

26:32.852 --> 26:35.071
- Please,
you're making a mistake.

26:35.115 --> 26:38.118
- I'm making a mistake?
I'm making a mistake!

26:46.779 --> 26:48.607
Get out. Out!

26:55.570 --> 26:58.791
- No, no, no. Please.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.670
- Sounds like he's really
putting the screws on him.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.454
- Let me know
if he needs backup.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.326
I gotta take a leak.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.593
- Don't do this, Nate.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.858
- Ah!

27:22.902 --> 27:24.120
- Ahh!

27:24.164 --> 27:27.689
Ahh!
- What are you doing?

27:27.733 --> 27:30.649
- I'm trying to tell you
that you don't...

27:30.692 --> 27:32.781
Have to tell me...

27:32.825 --> 27:35.566
Anything you don't want to, because...

27:35.610 --> 27:38.221
I will find
the answers I want...

27:38.265 --> 27:39.658
some other way, okay?

27:42.399 --> 27:44.706
- This is even worse
than last time.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.318
- I've interrogated you before?

27:48.362 --> 27:50.407
-
Of course you don't remember.

27:50.451 --> 27:54.498
You and your men came
after me and my family,

27:54.542 --> 27:58.677
and hundreds of others on your
manhunt for Emma Goldman,

27:58.720 --> 28:00.591
back in 1919.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.332
I knew nothing about her,

28:02.376 --> 28:05.205
but because of your Red Scare,
no one believed me.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.164
My wife and children
had to flee,

28:08.208 --> 28:10.427
and your men beat me
for being Russian.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.387
I lost everything,
because of you!

28:20.437 --> 28:22.048
- I'm sorry, Igor.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.749
That makes total sense why you
were planning on kidnapping me.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.709
- Me?

28:32.449 --> 28:35.757
I try to stay as far away
from you as possible.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.193
But when you're looking
for enemies,

28:37.237 --> 28:38.891
that's all you see.

28:40.457 --> 28:43.591
Makes it easy to miss what's
going on right in front of you.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.775
- Where'd those mountains go?

28:53.819 --> 28:55.603
- That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

28:55.646 --> 28:58.606
Somebody switched tracks
15 miles back.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.869
- Igor, thank you, Igor.

29:00.913 --> 29:02.784
I'll untie you in a minute.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.047
Grab him!

29:07.006 --> 29:09.486
Jig is up, Hoover.
Get over here.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.229
It's kind of silly, huh?

29:13.273 --> 29:14.448
Put on the right kind of suit,

29:14.491 --> 29:16.755
and you can fool
anybody you want.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.757
Even America's best detective.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.896
- Pretty dumb pulling
a gun on a Bureau agent.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.072
- You think you're
the smart guy here?

29:30.116 --> 29:32.509
If you hadn't made such
a stink back in Midland,

29:32.553 --> 29:34.424
we never would have known
you were on this train.

29:34.468 --> 29:37.253
- Funny thing is we've been
trying to pinch you for months.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.429
Snorky's offering
a nice chunk of cash

29:39.473 --> 29:41.214
to whoever brings you in first.

29:43.651 --> 29:47.307
- Snorky.
Snorky-Snorky?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.265
- Who the heck is Snorky?

29:49.309 --> 29:51.441
- These guys work
for Al Capone.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.530
<i>- Come out
with your hands up, Hoover.</i>

29:57.883 --> 29:59.841
So do all of them.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.278
- You got two minutes!

30:12.158 --> 30:15.161
- I ain't got all day, Edgar!

30:15.204 --> 30:18.381
Come out,
or we start popping passengers.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.606
- Oh, we can totally
take these guys.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.087
- No.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.352
- Without Gideon it's hard
to keep track of the timeline,

30:32.395 --> 30:34.876
but Hoover wasn't killed
by mobsters, right?

30:36.008 --> 30:37.966
So don't we have to fight?

30:38.010 --> 30:40.229
- In the real timeline,
none of this happened.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.710
And the world
still thinks I'm Hoover.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.931
I'm gonna have
to make this right.

30:59.727 --> 31:00.902
- Come on.

31:05.776 --> 31:12.827
<i>â™ª</i>

31:21.923 --> 31:24.360
- Well, congratulations.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.405
You got me.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.107
- Who are you?

31:37.069 --> 31:38.070
- Damn it.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.030
- Give the multiverse
a low probability.

31:42.074 --> 31:44.206
I mean what even is a paragon?
- Mm-hmm.

31:44.250 --> 31:47.035
I think we are onto something
very important here, Z.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.602
- Me too, Aves.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.212
- Okay, so who's left
on our villains list?

31:50.256 --> 31:51.822
- Damien Darhk.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.955
- Loves us way too much
to kill us I think.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.958
- Mm-hmm. Mallus. Malice?
Whatever.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.961
Big Beebo--aww, David Bowie.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.658
You know, he got that
really great song out of us.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.051
- Yeah. it was very catchy.
- Yeah.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.226
Let's put him
in the "maybe" pile.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.575
- Okay.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.229
- What about those guys,
over there?

32:07.273 --> 32:09.623
- Ah, these guys over here.
We got time pirates.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.059
Time wraiths.
Time witches. Clones.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.627
Doppelgangers.
Ourselves. Time itself.

32:13.670 --> 32:16.456
- Okay. Let's call that
the "why the hell not" pile.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.240
- Copy that.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.938
Oh.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.113
And then there's this one.

32:23.115 --> 32:26.945
- I mean that's too
out there, right?

32:26.988 --> 32:29.164
- Zari, we've been chased
by a demon dog.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.992
Who's to say that
we're not being hunted by--

32:31.036 --> 32:34.517
<i>- Sara! Ava!
- Is that...</i>

32:34.561 --> 32:40.871
<i>- Guys? Hello?
Anybody. Hello?</i>

32:40.915 --> 32:43.657
<i>We got a Hoover-shaped
Nate problem.</i>

32:43.700 --> 32:45.702
- That does not sound good.
- Guys?

32:45.746 --> 32:47.313
- Hate to cut it short,

32:47.356 --> 32:49.489
but we could really use
some backup out here.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.144
- Yeah, Nate's been
kidnapped by Al Capone's men.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.712
-
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

32:55.756 --> 32:58.150
We need to find a way to stop
this with zero casualties.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.239
- What, with weed gummies
and magic booze?

33:01.196 --> 33:03.285
- Yes.
Yes?

33:03.329 --> 33:04.678
- I ain't gonna ask you again.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.854
We got Hoover.
Not some nobody clown.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.551
- You're right, I am a nobody.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.555
But I'm a nobody
who killed J. Edgar Hoover.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.645
- Killed?
- Yeah.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.125
- I'm surprised to bring
in the head

33:17.169 --> 33:18.518
of the Bureau of Investigation.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.476
Instead, I got Mr. Nobody.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.478
This is not the plan.

33:22.522 --> 33:24.002
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.743
- Oh, Snorky's gonna pop me,
for sure.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.397
- That doesn't seem fair.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.051
I mean, how could you
have known the guy

33:30.095 --> 33:31.835
you were supposed to kidnap
ended up getting killed?

33:31.879 --> 33:33.750
Some things are outside
of your control.

33:33.794 --> 33:36.057
- I could just bump you off and
mess your face up real good.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.754
Pass you off as Hoover's body.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.801
- You could do that.
May work, for a while, but...

33:47.373 --> 33:49.331
you can't outrun
the lie forever.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.378
Eventually,
you just end up hurting

33:52.421 --> 33:54.162
the people you care about.

33:54.206 --> 33:56.077
Sometimes, it's easier
just to face the music

33:56.121 --> 33:58.123
and accept the fact
that you made a mistake.

33:59.385 --> 34:02.605
Hey, take a deep breath
with me. Come on.

34:06.827 --> 34:12.093
Now, repeat after me.
I forgive myself.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.966
- I forgive myself.
- There!

34:16.010 --> 34:17.272
Now, don't you feel better?

34:17.316 --> 34:19.057
- No.
- Oh.

34:19.927 --> 34:22.364
- But that makes me
feel better.

34:22.408 --> 34:25.237
- You all right there, big guy?
- Better now.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.195
- Hoover's death must have been
quite the shock,

34:27.239 --> 34:28.936
so we brought you
a little something

34:28.979 --> 34:30.546
to soothe your grieving souls.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.548
- And there's plenty more
where that came from.

34:32.592 --> 34:35.203
- Oh, never-ending,
one could say.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.987
- Holy smokes.

34:37.031 --> 34:41.427
The Bullet Blondes?
The big fellow loves you gals.

34:43.168 --> 34:46.432
- I would like
to formally apologize

34:46.475 --> 34:48.086
for how I treated you both.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.219
And I would like to ask
for a do-over.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.091
- Already done.
- My man.

34:54.048 --> 34:55.919
- Your photographs don't
do you justice.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.579
- That's a lot of company,
for the middle of nowhere.

35:06.626 --> 35:13.676
<i>â™ª</i>

35:25.210 --> 35:28.256
- Boys. Ladies.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.953
- Another Hoover?

35:29.997 --> 35:31.912
- Thought you said
you killed him.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.654
- I--I did.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.139
- Okay.
Two Waveriders and two Hoovers.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.836
That cannot be
a coincidence.

35:42.879 --> 35:45.404
- Is it me, or does he look
even more pissed off now?

35:46.666 --> 35:48.189
- We're kidnapping you.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.148
- And I'm arresting you.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.801
In fact,
you're all under arrest.

35:51.845 --> 35:53.455
- Over our dead bodies!

35:53.499 --> 35:55.805
- Maybe we should just
skedaddle right over here.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.851
Yeah?
- Everybody, take cover!

36:04.597 --> 36:05.815
- Ah!

36:05.859 --> 36:12.909
<i>â™ª</i>

36:14.563 --> 36:17.479
- Get in there.
Come on, move it. Go!

36:17.523 --> 36:18.872
- We can't let
Hoover die again.

36:21.048 --> 36:22.354
- Don't think we need
to worry about that.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.666
- Ah! Ugh!

36:30.710 --> 36:32.277
Jeez, ah!

36:35.149 --> 36:37.325
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa, slow.

36:37.369 --> 36:38.935
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait...

36:40.720 --> 36:42.069
- Guys, this is out of control.

36:42.112 --> 36:44.593
The timeline's at serious
risk of changing.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.725
- What are you doing?

36:55.822 --> 36:57.258
- Oh!

36:57.302 --> 36:58.390
- Come on.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.573
- Oh, no.
Did we kill him again?

37:12.926 --> 37:14.275
- There's no blood.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.886
- Whoa. That dude is tough.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.718
- I don't even think
he is a dude.

37:22.762 --> 37:24.024
I think he's a...

37:31.118 --> 37:32.162
- Robot.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.296
- What are the chances?

37:35.340 --> 37:38.125
Wait, so robots blow up
the Waverider?

37:40.127 --> 37:43.391
<i>- J. Edgar Hoover, a robot.
That explains a lot.</i>

37:43.435 --> 37:46.089
<i>- I ate a robot?</i>

37:46.133 --> 37:47.569
- Shh.
- Sorry, stomach,

37:47.613 --> 37:49.615
and small intestine,
and small stomach, and--

37:49.658 --> 37:52.095
- Gary, shush. Shush.
You did not eat a robot.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.401
You ate the real Hoover.

37:53.445 --> 37:55.751
This--this must be
his replacement.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.623
- You guys,
what--what is he doing?

37:58.624 --> 38:00.321
<i>- Rebooting himself?</i>

38:00.365 --> 38:04.107
<i>- Self-destruct sequence
initiated. 20 seconds.</i>

38:04.151 --> 38:06.153
- Um, guys,
I don't think that--yeah.

38:06.196 --> 38:09.025
- We gotta go!
Come on. Let's go. Move it.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.289
- Oh, I hope
Spooner and Astra are okay.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.855
They're probably having
the chillest time

38:12.899 --> 38:14.596
at Gloria's right now.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.989
- Come on, come on, come on,
come on!

38:19.166 --> 38:24.084
<i>â™ª</i>

38:32.919 --> 38:35.182
- Hey, Gideon.
Hey...

38:36.879 --> 38:40.970
I'm sorry.
I'm so used to the old you.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.233
The one who always had
all the answers.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.106
I never thought you'd be
the one needing help from us.

38:48.064 --> 38:50.676
Do you think
we could try again?

38:55.550 --> 38:59.206
- I wish we could figure out
a way to communicate with her.

38:59.249 --> 39:00.860
I mean, she's obviously trying.

39:03.689 --> 39:07.214
- Amor, you'll find a way.
You always did.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.785
Esperanza, you didn't speak
until you were six years old.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.355
- I don't remember that.

39:17.398 --> 39:20.183
- You communicated with me
in other ways.

39:20.227 --> 39:22.838
We always understood
each other, you and I,

39:22.882 --> 39:24.579
even if we weren't using words.

39:24.623 --> 39:27.408
You would come over
and hug me

39:27.452 --> 39:31.107
or hold my hand.

39:32.718 --> 39:35.111
Your little touch,
it made me feel heard.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.550
It's your gift, Esperanza.

39:42.554 --> 39:43.729
<i>- Gracias, Mami.</i>

39:51.824 --> 39:58.918
<i>â™ª</i>

40:01.268 --> 40:03.401
I know this must be tough
for you.

40:04.184 --> 40:06.055
I get it.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.754
And it must be really hard
when no one understands

40:08.797 --> 40:10.625
what you're trying
to tell them.

40:10.669 --> 40:13.454
And I hope you know
that you're not useless.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.630
You're just figuring it out.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.724
<i>- I'm terrified.
How did I even get here?</i>

40:22.768 --> 40:24.552
<i>I'm so lost.
Why can't they understand me?</i>

40:24.596 --> 40:26.162
- I can hear her.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.164
I can hear Gideon's thoughts.
She's scared.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.123
- What's she saying?
- Hey, it's okay.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.473
Gideon, I'm right here.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.302
Just breathe and focus.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.308
<i>- Dr. Davies' machine
in New York City.</i>

40:41.351 --> 40:43.658
<i>Time travel experiment
takes place November 7th.</i>

40:43.702 --> 40:45.921
- She's saying Dr. Davies'
time travel experiment

40:45.965 --> 40:47.575
will take place
in New York City,

40:47.619 --> 40:49.359
on November 7, 1925.

40:49.403 --> 40:52.450
- That's two weeks from today.
- Precisely, Captain.

40:55.670 --> 40:57.367
- She's back!

40:57.411 --> 40:59.500
- That's fantastic.
The plan's gonna work.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.023
- Two weeks.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.503
Maybe that explains
why they're not back yet.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.244
- But we have to get
to Dr. Davies first,

41:05.071 --> 41:06.507
or the Legends will die.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.161
- Or maybe that's why.

41:11.207 --> 41:12.382
- Pack up that ranch wear.

41:14.210 --> 41:15.734
We've got some Legends to save.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.846
- Greg, move your head.
