00:56.163 --> 00:58.643
Mommy, why do you have
to go away so much?

00:59.276 --> 01:01.196
Aw, baby. I don't go away that often.

01:01.643 --> 01:02.643
Yes, you do.

01:03.485 --> 01:05.045
Yeah, you kind of do, Julia.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.679
Guys, I'm so sorry.

01:07.047 --> 01:08.727
Mommy has a very important job.

01:08.843 --> 01:10.923
I still don't understand what you do.

01:11.165 --> 01:12.645
She helps keep people safe.

01:13.163 --> 01:15.443
- Like me?
- Yeah, just like you.

01:15.834 --> 01:18.874
- Thanks, Mommy. I love you.
- I love you too, sugar bear.

01:39.747 --> 01:42.007
- Mrs. Foster.
- Hey, Jack.

01:43.220 --> 01:46.533
- So where are you heading now?
- You know I can't tell you that.

01:46.623 --> 01:48.943
Well, I thought maybe
you would slip up just once.

02:14.943 --> 02:16.023
I love you guys.

02:17.146 --> 02:18.226
We love you too.

02:18.425 --> 02:20.865
How long are you going to be gone
this time?

02:21.506 --> 02:23.586
One week. Hey.

02:24.990 --> 02:25.912
I'm sorry.

02:26.002 --> 02:27.242
Hey, it's what I signed up for.

02:28.337 --> 02:30.337
It's all a part of being married
to an FBI agent.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.923
You know, I've been thinking

02:33.013 --> 02:35.733
about maybe asking some
of the younger agents

02:35.832 --> 02:37.232
to cover my field work.

02:37.428 --> 02:40.028
And I could do a little bit more work
from home.

02:40.586 --> 02:43.866
- Do you think they can handle the job?
- I think it's worth a chance.

02:44.780 --> 02:47.580
Well, let's talk about it
when you get back.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.956
In the meantime, you go about protecting

02:51.062 --> 02:53.142
whoever it is that you're protecting

02:53.248 --> 02:55.248
and just make sure
you come home safely, okay?

02:55.366 --> 02:56.366
Yeah, I will.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.520
You know, I'm gonna go
to some pretty cool countries.

02:59.628 --> 03:01.103
You want me to bring you back anything?

03:01.104 --> 03:02.864
- Coffee.
- Coffee?

03:04.224 --> 03:04.993
What?

03:05.083 --> 03:09.083
Yeah, you and Daddy drink it
all the time. So it must be good.

03:09.175 --> 03:11.695
Coffee is not for kids, silly.

03:11.790 --> 03:12.990
Not even a little bit.

03:13.098 --> 03:14.338
- How about a doll?
- No.

03:15.322 --> 03:16.322
I want coffee.

03:16.585 --> 03:18.105
Coffee, okay. Coffee it is.

03:18.616 --> 03:19.616
I love you.

03:22.831 --> 03:23.951
- I love you.
- Love you too.

03:24.978 --> 03:25.978
Okay.

03:30.570 --> 03:31.570
Hi.

03:32.676 --> 03:34.116
- Thanks.
- I'll get this.

03:35.732 --> 03:37.772
Bye, Mommy. I love you.

03:39.666 --> 03:40.666
I love you.

03:42.119 --> 03:43.119
Be safe.

03:48.376 --> 03:50.456
- Right, you okay? Huh?
- Yes.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.940
All right. Thank you.

04:41.988 --> 04:45.348
The rain is starting to come down.
Can you believe this?

04:45.765 --> 04:47.288
I miss Mommy already.

04:47.378 --> 04:49.977
I... I know. I miss Mommy too,

04:50.067 --> 04:53.347
but you and I are going to have
so much fun

04:53.635 --> 04:56.755
and Mommy will be back
before you know it, right?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.497
- Yeah.
- All right.

05:49.462 --> 05:50.502
Oh my goodness.

05:51.848 --> 05:52.888
Oh my goodness.

05:55.777 --> 05:56.857
This is so cool.

05:59.086 --> 06:00.126
Oh my goodness.

06:02.337 --> 06:03.696
And you're sure you're not spoiling her?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.417
No, I'm giving her autonomy.

06:05.515 --> 06:07.101
Do you know how much time
that's gonna save us?

06:07.102 --> 06:08.862
I know, but a brand new car?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.512
A new car's a safe car.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.239
That's true
but, you know, she's been a little...

06:13.266 --> 06:14.306
Not today, babe.

06:14.676 --> 06:16.140
I love that little girl.
I'd do anything for her.

06:16.141 --> 06:17.421
You know she's had a rough time.

06:21.872 --> 06:23.392
Thank you, thank you, Mom.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.564
Of course, baby.

06:25.879 --> 06:27.719
- Thanks, Daniel.
- Happy birthday, kiddo.

06:28.447 --> 06:30.487
- It's beautiful.
- Good.

06:30.596 --> 06:31.636
It's beautiful.

06:31.730 --> 06:33.810
It's a car. It's dangerous. Okay.

06:33.921 --> 06:36.201
So smart and safe.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.493
- Smart and safe...
- I got you.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.597
- I promise.
- All right.

06:40.922 --> 06:44.322
You know, Abbey, just one more time.
Just to make sure you hear me.

06:44.702 --> 06:45.982
Smart and safe.

06:46.390 --> 06:49.310
Mom, I promise.

06:51.109 --> 06:52.349
So can I drive it?

06:54.982 --> 06:57.062
- It's her car.
- It is.

06:59.852 --> 07:03.852
Kids, guys, one at a time, just
around the block and back, all right?

07:03.952 --> 07:07.192
And no distractions or radio,
nothing like that, all right?

07:07.635 --> 07:08.675
Smart and safe.

07:09.316 --> 07:10.516
Yeah, I got you.

07:16.405 --> 07:17.876
Maybe I can take you on that date now.

07:17.877 --> 07:19.223
In my new car? I don't think so.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.673
- Well, why not?
- Grow up, Bobby.

07:20.776 --> 07:22.935
If you wanna take me on a date,
you have to get your own car first.

07:22.936 --> 07:24.336
My parents aren't nearly that cool.

07:26.210 --> 07:28.042
- Janelle, wanna go?
- Yeah, let's go.

07:28.132 --> 07:29.132
Let's go.

07:38.757 --> 07:42.117
- So are we having cake or what?
- And ice cream.

07:42.269 --> 07:43.407
Cake and ice cream.
Come on, let's eat it all

07:43.408 --> 07:44.448
before the girls get back!

07:47.960 --> 07:49.160
- Ready?
- Okay, yes, let's go.

07:49.337 --> 07:50.337
Here we go.

08:17.076 --> 08:19.156
Daniel, please tell them to stop.

08:19.252 --> 08:20.812
Oh, come on, Abbey, it was an accident.

08:21.317 --> 08:22.877
Really? An accident?

08:23.183 --> 08:24.263
You always defend them.

08:24.657 --> 08:25.777
I don't always defend them.

08:25.886 --> 08:27.766
All right, guys, come back
and say you're sorry.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.275
By referring to it as an accident,
you're trivializing what they did.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.876
Hey, watch your tongue please.

08:32.395 --> 08:33.635
Now you're defending him?

08:34.335 --> 08:36.596
Does it ever stop? Can you see
what I've had to put up with

08:36.597 --> 08:37.756
ever since they moved in?

08:38.047 --> 08:40.087
Can't you guys see
that you always gang up on me?

08:40.386 --> 08:41.386
All the time?

08:41.629 --> 08:43.429
Why are you living
in the same house together?

08:43.702 --> 08:45.382
Can't you wait until
I go away to college?

08:45.441 --> 08:47.012
You know what?
You keep talking with that tone,

08:47.013 --> 08:48.253
you're not gonna go to college.

08:48.452 --> 08:49.452
I don't believe that.

08:49.847 --> 08:51.947
I'm sure you and Daniel can't wait
until I go away to college.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.988
In fact, you probably bought me the car
so you won't have to see me as much.

08:55.357 --> 08:57.637
Seriously? That's ridiculous.

08:57.756 --> 08:59.966
Come on, Mom. Don't be a hypocrite.

09:00.056 --> 09:01.205
Don't you dare talk to your mother
like that!

09:01.206 --> 09:03.406
Don't you dare talk to me
that way! Okay?

09:04.701 --> 09:05.781
You're not my father.

09:06.185 --> 09:07.324
In fact, you should stay out of anything

09:07.325 --> 09:08.565
that relates to my mother.

09:09.277 --> 09:11.420
Okay, you know what, Janelle?
I think it's time for you to go home.

09:11.421 --> 09:13.644
No, Janelle needs to see
that it's not an all as perfect

09:13.734 --> 09:15.028
as it appears from the outside.

09:15.118 --> 09:17.678
Abbey! You are out of line!

09:17.916 --> 09:18.916
I'm out of line?

09:21.006 --> 09:22.246
Look what you've done to us.

09:23.108 --> 09:24.028
You brought him

09:24.122 --> 09:25.840
and you brought his two little brats
into our house

09:25.841 --> 09:27.001
and ruined everything!

09:30.833 --> 09:31.833
You know what, Abbey?

09:32.389 --> 09:34.509
You told me that you liked Daniel.

09:34.632 --> 09:36.672
You told me
that you wanted me to be happy.

09:36.775 --> 09:39.719
But what about my happiness?
Didn't you ever think about me?

09:39.809 --> 09:41.569
I always think about you.

09:41.887 --> 09:43.727
No, you don't.

09:43.821 --> 09:45.861
- I thought this was the right decision.
- It's not.

09:48.692 --> 09:49.852
Come on, Janelle.

09:57.228 --> 10:01.988
She's a teenager, right?
I mean, she just has a chemical imbalance.

10:03.808 --> 10:04.800
I knew we should have waited

10:04.801 --> 10:06.721
until she went away to college
to get married.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.030
No. No, we did the right thing. We did.

10:10.120 --> 10:14.000
She just has to learn
to be more understanding.

10:15.118 --> 10:16.758
That's the understatement
of the century.

10:17.837 --> 10:18.997
- Happy birthday.
- Yeah.

10:19.583 --> 10:20.623
Happy birthday.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.921
Let's go clean up.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.253
I hate my life.

10:24.464 --> 10:27.184
I feel really uncomfortable.
I think I should get going.

10:27.356 --> 10:28.476
Do you see what they did?

10:28.862 --> 10:30.862
They gang up on me like that
all of the time.

10:36.668 --> 10:39.228
- What are you doing?
- I need to talk to Gavin.

10:39.885 --> 10:42.245
- He doesn't even know you.
- How can you say that?

10:42.531 --> 10:45.011
I've talked to him every day
for the last two years.

10:45.161 --> 10:47.601
Yeah, by email.
You don't really know him.

10:47.704 --> 10:49.566
Okay, did Romeo and Juliet
really know each other

10:49.567 --> 10:51.007
before they finally got together?

10:52.070 --> 10:54.750
- Well...
- Exactly.

10:56.502 --> 10:57.822
So why haven't you met him yet?

10:57.965 --> 11:00.165
Because he thought
I wasn't old enough yet.

11:00.602 --> 11:01.842
He wanted to wait.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.130
Wait until when?

11:03.220 --> 11:04.300
Until I'm 16.

11:04.944 --> 11:05.794
Why 16?

11:05.931 --> 11:09.531
16 is when I can drive and come see him.

11:09.728 --> 11:12.608
Well, I don't get it. If he's 23,
why can't he come to see you?

11:13.350 --> 11:15.390
Because I'm a minor, you know?

11:15.949 --> 11:16.949
It's illegal.

11:17.226 --> 11:19.237
Well, he can still get arrested
if he comes out here

11:19.238 --> 11:21.398
or you go to... Where is he again?

11:22.529 --> 11:25.289
- He was in Prescott, Arizona.
- Where's that?

11:25.412 --> 11:27.932
It's a farm town west of Phoenix.

11:28.022 --> 11:29.525
You're Internet dating a farmer?

11:29.615 --> 11:32.039
He's not a farmer. He's a cop.

11:32.129 --> 11:34.729
Well, he can still go to jail
for being with a minor.

11:34.905 --> 11:37.145
If I'm emancipated, there's no problem.

11:37.357 --> 11:38.317
Okay, emanci-what?

11:38.412 --> 11:40.311
It means that I'm legally separated
from my mother

11:40.312 --> 11:42.141
and then I'm no longer a minor
in the eyes of the law.

11:42.142 --> 11:43.554
Oh, I bet Gavin figured that one out.

11:43.555 --> 11:44.555
You know what? He did.

11:45.615 --> 11:46.615
So what?

11:46.836 --> 11:50.591
Just it's a lot of work to go through
just to see some guy you don't even know.

11:50.681 --> 11:51.721
Okay, I do know him.

11:53.116 --> 11:56.756
You know, I know everything about him.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.298
I haven't met another guy
like him before.

12:01.167 --> 12:02.167
I don't know.

12:02.267 --> 12:03.947
I think Bobby Evans is pretty cute.

12:04.294 --> 12:07.214
Bobby Evans is 17 years old, okay?
He's a kid.

12:07.331 --> 12:08.331
Gavin's a man.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.695
Gavin's traveled
the entire world already.

12:13.465 --> 12:14.945
Gavin... Gavin knows me.

12:17.372 --> 12:18.602
He understands me.

12:18.692 --> 12:20.772
I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right to me.

12:20.868 --> 12:21.868
That's okay.

12:22.336 --> 12:24.617
Because you haven't experienced
anything like this before.

12:25.067 --> 12:28.867
You know what, when you do,
you'll completely understand.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.820
<i>Abbey, we need to talk.</i>

12:37.198 --> 12:38.398
There's nothing to talk about.

12:38.552 --> 12:40.491
There's a lot to talk about, honey.
Just come out here

12:40.492 --> 12:42.172
and let's have a conversation
face to face.

12:42.234 --> 12:44.034
Like when? To tell me that I'm wrong?

12:44.317 --> 12:46.517
I'm not gonna be happy
until he's out of this house.

12:46.621 --> 12:48.941
He's not going anywhere.
Honey, we're family now.

12:49.037 --> 12:51.557
Just come out here
and let's talk like families do.

12:51.733 --> 12:53.973
- Okay, he is not my family.
- Abbey.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.714
Okay, there's nothing more
to talk about.

12:57.379 --> 13:00.459
- Please leave me alone.
- Fine.

13:16.832 --> 13:19.032
Tonight? They'll take your car away.

13:19.143 --> 13:20.343
Not if I'm in Arizona.

13:20.657 --> 13:23.817
Abbey, please think clearly.
You don't know this guy.

13:23.927 --> 13:24.927
I do know him.

13:25.746 --> 13:27.946
Like, how could you say that?

13:28.579 --> 13:31.179
I'm just trying to be a good friend.

13:31.572 --> 13:35.372
You know, I'm not looking for someone
to play devil's advocate, okay?

13:37.906 --> 13:39.226
Friends do not do that.

13:39.428 --> 13:41.908
You're wrong.
That's what friends are supposed to do.

13:42.516 --> 13:43.876
Not the friends I want in my life.

13:45.034 --> 13:47.394
Fine. I'm out of here.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.614
- Don't you dare tell your mother.
- Really?

13:50.516 --> 13:52.116
That's how you talk to your best friend?

13:53.299 --> 13:54.459
Real cool, Abbey.

13:55.179 --> 13:57.419
I don't know what's gotten into you
but I don't like it.

14:01.963 --> 14:02.963
Whatever.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.365
Hey.

15:01.061 --> 15:02.101
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.780
Come on, honey.

15:05.806 --> 15:07.566
She's 16.
She's just going through a phase.

15:07.876 --> 15:09.956
No, she's not just 16.

15:11.455 --> 15:12.855
She's been traumatized.

15:13.074 --> 15:14.754
Well, I know.

15:15.210 --> 15:19.410
But she still has to be respectful
to you, me and the kids.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.354
I know.

15:23.437 --> 15:26.797
I just want you to truly understand,
you know,

15:26.887 --> 15:28.641
what it was that she went through.

15:28.731 --> 15:29.731
I get it.

15:30.408 --> 15:31.408
But...

15:33.964 --> 15:35.934
I'm sorry, but from what
you've told me about Lucas,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.615
I think he would want
you both to move on.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.153
It's been 10 years.

15:42.072 --> 15:43.072
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:45.329 --> 15:48.929
I just feel like such a bad mom,
you know?

15:49.040 --> 15:51.640
She's so angry and she's hurting and

15:53.912 --> 15:55.872
I just feel like this is all my fault.

15:56.052 --> 15:58.880
Well, I'm sure smarter people
than I am have told you

15:58.970 --> 16:00.610
it's not your fault, honey.

16:01.296 --> 16:02.696
But by the same token,

16:02.787 --> 16:06.147
we can't be tormented by this
every time there's an issue,

16:06.249 --> 16:08.729
and I'm sorry if "torment"
is too strong a word...

16:08.823 --> 16:10.343
Well, that's debatable.

16:10.833 --> 16:14.713
Well, yeah, yeah, because, you know,
she rules this house.

16:15.544 --> 16:18.418
She does whatever she wants to do
and all I'm saying about that

16:18.508 --> 16:23.626
is that maybe it's time to exact
a little more control over her

16:23.716 --> 16:25.436
before things
get completely out of hand.

16:26.213 --> 16:28.533
Now, you've just given her
some serious autonomy

16:28.629 --> 16:33.229
so maybe along with that,
some new rules and boundaries, yeah?

16:34.210 --> 16:36.491
Mind, she's a teenager.
You remember what that feels like?

16:37.967 --> 16:41.750
Yeah, I mean, her hormones are raging,
her emotions are scattered,

16:41.840 --> 16:45.760
and now she's got this whole new sense
of independence. It's a lot.

16:45.922 --> 16:46.922
You're right.

16:47.367 --> 16:49.856
I'm gonna let her cool off tonight
and I'll talk to her in the morning.

16:49.857 --> 16:50.857
Good idea.

16:51.691 --> 16:54.331
I tell you what,
why don't we get a good night's sleep

16:55.259 --> 16:56.909
because I'm sure
everything's gonna look a lot better

16:56.910 --> 16:58.030
- in the morning.
- Hope so.

16:58.758 --> 17:00.038
Listen, please.

17:02.095 --> 17:04.415
Don't ever let me hear you say
you're a bad mother again,

17:05.619 --> 17:07.060
because that's not true.

17:08.481 --> 17:09.481
Come on.

17:14.050 --> 17:15.450
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:52.291 --> 17:53.371
I miss you.

20:09.616 --> 20:10.616
Abbey.

20:16.618 --> 20:17.618
Abbey.

20:19.163 --> 20:20.163
Abbey.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.059
Abbey, this isn't funny.

20:22.186 --> 20:23.546
She left last night.

20:24.432 --> 20:25.952
She... she's gone.

20:26.069 --> 20:27.229
She's gone. Mom!

20:28.227 --> 20:29.227
She's gone.

20:29.793 --> 20:30.913
- Who's gone?
- Abbey.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.898
She's not here and her car's gone.

20:33.102 --> 20:34.422
- Did you see when she left?
- No.

20:34.694 --> 20:35.774
Did you see when she left?

20:37.342 --> 20:38.342
When?

20:38.787 --> 20:39.787
Last night.

20:39.981 --> 20:41.701
- So why didn't you say anything?
- Brandon?

20:41.769 --> 20:42.969
Because I wanted her gone.

20:43.912 --> 20:45.512
All she ever does is cause trouble.

20:46.474 --> 20:48.629
Oh, she probably just went
to Janelle's house.

20:48.719 --> 20:49.719
I hope so.

20:50.455 --> 20:51.455
All right.

20:52.450 --> 20:53.530
No, Mommy, wait.

20:56.036 --> 20:57.036
Okay.

21:00.079 --> 21:01.159
Now what's this?

21:01.819 --> 21:02.819
Here it is.

21:03.181 --> 21:05.174
"Mom, I'm fine. Don't worry about me."

21:05.264 --> 21:08.144
"I'm just visiting a friend.
I'll be back soon. I love you, Abbey."

21:08.859 --> 21:10.459
Damn it. Why is she doing this?

21:11.679 --> 21:13.239
All right. Anybody know her password?

21:13.343 --> 21:19.743
- Oh, try I-H-A-T-E-M-Y-F-A...
- I hate my family. Really?

21:19.855 --> 21:21.215
Not funny. Really.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.894
- Does anyone know her password?
- It could be anything, honey.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.460
- Maybe Janelle knows it.
- Good.

21:26.315 --> 21:27.923
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Janelle's.

21:27.924 --> 21:28.886
All right, I'll call the police.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.727
I can't. They won't do anything.
It's too soon.

21:30.794 --> 21:32.391
Well, what about your friends
at the FBI, honey?

21:32.392 --> 21:34.232
Martin, Missing Persons, owes me.
You're right.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
What?

23:19.079 --> 23:20.359
I'm gonna be happy.

23:25.011 --> 23:28.251
All I know is that his name is Gavin
and he lives in Arizona.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.339
How long has she known this boy?

23:30.573 --> 23:31.613
He's not a boy.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.841
He's 23 years old.

23:34.334 --> 23:35.894
You're kidding? Twenty-three years old?

23:35.939 --> 23:36.939
- Julia.
- What? What?

23:37.329 --> 23:40.369
Our daughter just ran away to Arizona
to be with a 23-year-old man.

23:41.024 --> 23:43.344
They've had an online relationship
for two years.

23:43.457 --> 23:45.737
Okay, that's just impossible.

23:46.314 --> 23:50.922
Well, no disrespect, Mrs. Foster,
but Abbey has a computer in her bedroom,

23:51.012 --> 23:52.412
a laptop and a cell phone.

23:52.915 --> 23:55.637
Not unless you've been monitoring
her activity every second of the day,

23:55.638 --> 23:57.398
would you have any idea
what she's up to.

23:58.035 --> 24:00.835
Okay, well, that's the end
of your privacy, young lady.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.438
Janelle, do you...

24:04.711 --> 24:06.071
Do you know Abbey's password?

24:08.630 --> 24:10.950
Janelle, your friend can be in danger.

24:11.332 --> 24:13.132
This is not the time to keep secrets.

24:13.434 --> 24:15.274
You need to tell us everything
that you know.

24:19.254 --> 24:20.254
Honey?

24:21.587 --> 24:23.107
I don't know her Chatter password

24:24.716 --> 24:26.716
but I do know her email password.

24:27.146 --> 24:28.146
Okay.

24:28.596 --> 24:30.916
Okay, but that's not gonna help us.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.331
Didn't she only communicate with him
on chatterama.com?

24:33.514 --> 24:34.954
Yes, but I have a trick.

24:35.625 --> 24:36.500
Follow me to my bedroom.

24:36.501 --> 24:38.901
No, no, no, no.
You just go get your laptop.

24:38.998 --> 24:41.358
That's right.
No more laptop in the bedroom.

24:41.453 --> 24:43.533
You go get it
and you bring it in the kitchen.

24:54.057 --> 24:57.937
All that you do is enter email address
and attempt to enter a password.

24:58.456 --> 25:01.631
Then, you see it asks
if you forgot her password

25:01.721 --> 25:03.905
so you click that and it tells you

25:03.995 --> 25:06.395
to check your email
to change her password,

25:06.861 --> 25:09.341
so then I go to her email and

25:10.320 --> 25:12.697
there it is.
An email from chatterama.com

25:12.787 --> 25:14.907
that will link to an option
to change her password.

25:15.003 --> 25:17.843
But now Abbey won't be able
to get into her Chatter page.

25:17.943 --> 25:18.943
Good.

25:19.096 --> 25:20.895
Well, what if she needs it
while she's gone?

25:20.985 --> 25:22.691
Nobody needs social media.

25:22.781 --> 25:24.772
New invention called the phone.
She can use that.

25:24.862 --> 25:26.102
So what's her new password?

25:26.209 --> 25:27.929
Runaway, with a capital "R."

25:28.048 --> 25:29.368
Well, no one's gonna forget that.

25:29.533 --> 25:32.133
So now I navigate back
to Chatterama.com,

25:32.230 --> 25:36.145
enter email address
and new password and, voila.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.235
We're in.

25:38.455 --> 25:40.335
Gavin Brown, is that his name?

25:40.437 --> 25:42.117
And looks like a nice kid.

25:42.223 --> 25:43.663
He's not a kid. He's a grown man.

25:44.008 --> 25:45.888
And he's a police officer.

25:46.288 --> 25:48.962
What's a 23-year-old cop doing
with an 11th grader?

25:49.052 --> 25:50.052
I don't know.

25:51.940 --> 25:55.780
Oh, I can't believe she was doing this
all behind my back. I...

25:56.472 --> 25:59.472
Is her life that miserable that
she had to live some false existence?

25:59.581 --> 26:00.702
Well, it wasn't false to her

26:00.792 --> 26:02.252
and now that's she there,
it's all too real.

26:02.253 --> 26:04.963
Honey, you've gotta get on the phone
with Martin immediately and find her.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.684
Who knows what this guy's motives are.

26:06.870 --> 26:07.823
You know, do me a favor.

26:07.824 --> 26:10.104
Just go to the most recent messages.

26:10.756 --> 26:13.196
He's gotta have given her some address
or something, right?

26:14.550 --> 26:16.270
There, Prescott, Arizona.

26:18.334 --> 26:19.334
Looks like a restaurant.

26:19.437 --> 26:21.279
Well, at least they're meeting
in a public place.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.259
- I gotta get on the next plane.
- I'll take you to the airport.

26:23.260 --> 26:24.095
Thank you.

26:24.185 --> 26:25.425
Thank you. Thank you.

26:27.562 --> 26:28.913
Martin can set a plane up
for you, right?

26:28.914 --> 26:30.434
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

26:49.636 --> 26:50.716
That's so weird. What...

26:55.400 --> 26:56.400
What...

26:59.718 --> 27:00.878
What the hell's going on?

27:06.992 --> 27:08.453
<i>So you're telling me
there's no Gavin Brown</i>

27:08.454 --> 27:10.118
<i>working at the Arizona
Police Department?</i>

27:10.208 --> 27:12.008
Well, there were a few Browns
but no Gavins.

27:12.938 --> 27:14.498
<i>Can you get into her Chatter account?</i>

27:14.611 --> 27:17.211
Oh, come on now, Julia.
You know our tentacles don't go that deep.

27:17.342 --> 27:18.456
So the NSA can record

27:18.546 --> 27:20.346
Germany's prime minister's conversations

27:21.045 --> 27:23.196
but we can't get
into any social media sites?

27:23.286 --> 27:24.286
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

27:24.533 --> 27:26.973
Oh, that's insane.

27:27.336 --> 27:29.581
<i>Yeah, well, those Silicone Valley guys
have more money than us</i>

27:29.582 --> 27:30.902
<i>so we can't even win in court.</i>

27:31.749 --> 27:33.069
Look, I'll tell you what, I'll...

27:33.469 --> 27:36.029
I'll contact the San Jose office,
see if they can help out.

27:36.416 --> 27:38.456
Call me back if you find anything out.
Thank you.

27:39.301 --> 27:40.301
Jesus.

27:40.754 --> 27:43.544
You sure we're not over-reacting?
We don't even know the whole story yet.

27:43.545 --> 27:45.825
He is impersonating a police officer.

27:46.035 --> 27:47.035
That's bad.

27:47.421 --> 27:48.383
She's 16 years old.

27:48.473 --> 27:50.646
I didn't even give her permission
to go down to the market,

27:50.647 --> 27:52.447
much less Arizona.

27:52.553 --> 27:53.953
No, we're not over-reacting.

27:55.446 --> 27:56.886
- Okay.
- Definitely not.

27:59.938 --> 28:01.658
- Have you heard from Daniel?
- No.

28:02.644 --> 28:04.015
What about my mother?

28:04.105 --> 28:05.104
<i>I haven't heard from them</i>

28:05.105 --> 28:07.785
but I'm sure your mom
is worried sick about you.

28:08.484 --> 28:10.292
<i>- You should really come back home.</i>
- I don't think so.

28:10.293 --> 28:11.653
Because she doesn't care about me.

28:12.181 --> 28:13.221
Gavin cares about me.

28:13.322 --> 28:16.002
Abbey, how do you know if
anything this guy has told you is true?

28:16.115 --> 28:17.555
Why would someone lie like that?

28:18.231 --> 28:19.711
Are you really that stupid?

28:20.012 --> 28:21.012
Okay, yeah.

28:21.414 --> 28:22.414
Yeah, I guess I am.

28:22.697 --> 28:25.617
You're a pretty 16-year-old girl.
He wants his way with you.

28:25.733 --> 28:27.893
You're just jealous
because you don't have a boyfriend.

28:28.167 --> 28:29.167
No, I'm not.

28:29.342 --> 28:30.702
I'm perfectly happy.

28:30.888 --> 28:33.140
What's wrong with you that you have
to drive all the way out to Arizona

28:33.141 --> 28:34.501
- to meet a guy?
- Meet a guy?

28:34.687 --> 28:36.927
I know him, okay?
I know everything about him.

28:37.304 --> 28:39.544
We've talked every day
for the last two years.

28:39.655 --> 28:41.455
Then why hasn't he come out to see you?

28:41.862 --> 28:43.702
Why are you driving all the way out
to Arizona?

28:43.861 --> 28:46.237
He has a job.
He can't just pick up and go.

28:46.327 --> 28:47.607
<i>Really? That doesn't make sense.</i>

28:47.756 --> 28:48.677
None of this sounds right.

28:48.678 --> 28:51.038
Please just turn your car around
and come home.

28:51.132 --> 28:52.511
You know what?
I don't need this from you.

28:52.512 --> 28:53.459
No, you don't.

28:53.549 --> 28:54.549
Okay, I'm hanging up.

28:54.819 --> 28:55.979
- Goodbye.
<i>- Abbey.</i>

29:41.410 --> 29:42.410
Abbey?

29:44.857 --> 29:45.857
Gavin?

29:48.201 --> 29:49.201
Hey.

29:58.258 --> 29:59.258
What's wrong?

30:00.399 --> 30:02.199
You look so much different
than your pictures.

30:02.388 --> 30:03.388
Different how?

30:06.680 --> 30:07.720
You look older.

30:08.637 --> 30:09.637
Older?

30:11.131 --> 30:13.412
I mean, my profile picture was
just taken a few weeks ago.

30:13.510 --> 30:16.270
I don't know, I just...
I didn't expect you to look so different.

30:18.574 --> 30:20.374
See, this is why we're perfect
for each other.

30:21.014 --> 30:23.287
This is why we're amazing.
We have this relationship that's based

30:23.288 --> 30:24.808
on so much more than just looks.

30:25.304 --> 30:28.344
I've had the opportunity
to fall in love with your mind.

30:28.792 --> 30:29.672
And you being gorgeous

30:29.789 --> 30:31.331
- is just icing on the cake.
- Yeah, you're right.

30:31.332 --> 30:34.052
You could literally have
the floppiest ears, the biggest nose

30:34.148 --> 30:35.332
and it wouldn't even matter

30:35.422 --> 30:39.702
because I've already fallen in love
with the beautiful person that you are.

30:40.227 --> 30:41.387
I'm sorry, Gavin.

30:41.505 --> 30:42.505
Hm, don't be.

30:42.881 --> 30:43.961
You're so right.

30:46.485 --> 30:47.485
Not yet.

30:48.558 --> 30:49.408
Why not?

30:49.604 --> 30:51.964
This isn't the right place
for our first kiss.

30:53.267 --> 30:54.465
- It... it's not?
- No.

30:54.555 --> 30:57.075
I imagined someplace epic.

30:57.179 --> 31:00.899
Someplace beautiful, you know?
Not the porch of an old restaurant.

31:01.221 --> 31:03.501
- Old guys staring at us with dogs.
- Yeah.

31:03.675 --> 31:05.315
But I have the biggest day
planned for us.

31:05.502 --> 31:06.742
So let's get going.

31:07.254 --> 31:08.504
And then we'll end the end of the night

31:08.505 --> 31:12.165
with some dinner
at the ranch and some wine.

31:12.496 --> 31:13.976
- Wine?
- Yeah, wine.

31:14.993 --> 31:17.753
You are a grown mature capable woman.

31:18.129 --> 31:19.849
Surely you can handle
a little bit of wine?

31:20.309 --> 31:22.109
- Of course I can.
- Of course you can.

31:25.139 --> 31:26.499
So where's your car?

31:26.987 --> 31:29.307
Oh, they don't let me use the patrol car
when I'm off duty.

31:29.338 --> 31:30.338
Oh, okay.

31:30.538 --> 31:32.015
- Do you wanna use mine?
- Do you mind?

31:32.016 --> 31:34.056
- Do you wanna drive?
- Do you want me to drive?

31:34.163 --> 31:35.603
- Yeah.
- Then I can drive.

31:36.342 --> 31:37.342
Let's go.

32:02.136 --> 32:03.296
Hey, sleepy head.

32:03.518 --> 32:04.558
I'm not sleepy.

32:04.744 --> 32:05.984
- No?
- No.

32:06.457 --> 32:08.657
Well, you drove all night.
You must be tired.

32:08.766 --> 32:12.166
I can't believe I'm here
and we're finally together.

32:12.466 --> 32:13.506
Well, what did I tell you?

32:14.322 --> 32:16.762
The moment you turned 16,
we could finally be together.

32:17.043 --> 32:18.123
And here we are.

32:21.194 --> 32:24.627
You know that moment
when Romeo first meets Juliet?

32:24.717 --> 32:26.197
- Yeah.
- That's how I feel right now.

32:26.238 --> 32:28.598
I feel like we were
in this expansive room

32:28.689 --> 32:32.649
and I'm watching you from afar
and now, suddenly, we're close.

32:32.944 --> 32:34.304
And pretty soon, I'll kiss you.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.060
Okay, that's so romantic.

32:38.245 --> 32:39.258
It's just what I feel, you know?

32:39.259 --> 32:42.019
I know, but you always used to say,
like, write how you feel.

32:42.468 --> 32:43.863
But I have to think about it.

32:43.953 --> 32:45.845
You can just come out and say it
with such perfection.

32:45.846 --> 32:47.366
Well, I do have a few years on you.

32:47.491 --> 32:48.851
Hm, okay, that's true.

32:48.956 --> 32:51.276
And you, you are so wise
beyond your 16 years.

32:52.325 --> 32:56.365
I swear, you have the beauty
and a mind of a woman, not a child.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.235
That's what fascinates me about you.

33:02.025 --> 33:04.465
- So where are we going?
- You will just have to wait and see.

33:05.273 --> 33:06.273
Okay.

33:07.117 --> 33:08.586
- Do you like country music?
- Yeah, okay.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.267
Ever since you sent me those songs,
it's all I've been listening to.

33:12.063 --> 33:14.903
- I knew you'd like it.
- Yeah, I do.

33:15.812 --> 33:17.892
Well, listen to this one. Relax, okay?

33:20.067 --> 33:21.067
Take a nap.

34:01.975 --> 34:03.255
Hey there, sleeping beauty.

34:05.586 --> 34:07.426
You were really knocked out there
for a minute.

34:08.527 --> 34:09.527
Yeah.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.793
Well, I stopped and I got you some food.

34:14.487 --> 34:17.768
- Yes, I am starving.
- Yeah, I figured as much.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.335
Oh, fries.

34:21.114 --> 34:22.475
You love me. You know me so well.

34:27.841 --> 34:29.561
You sent me pictures of this view, huh?

34:30.494 --> 34:31.494
That's right.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.989
Yes, it's one of my favorite places.
I spend a lot of time here.

34:36.043 --> 34:37.884
You know, just writing, thinking.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.120
- It's beautiful.
- Just like you.

34:47.705 --> 34:50.304
It makes quite the backdrop
for our first kiss, huh?

34:51.989 --> 34:52.989
No?

34:54.435 --> 34:55.435
You okay?

34:58.091 --> 34:59.091
Yeah, I'm just...

35:01.177 --> 35:02.977
- I'm just nervous.
- Nerves are good.

35:03.575 --> 35:05.855
Yeah, they mean that you care.
And that you're excited.

35:07.990 --> 35:11.070
- Are you nervous?
- I am so nervous with excitement.

35:12.119 --> 35:14.319
Because I've been waiting
for this moment for two years.

35:16.668 --> 35:17.668
Yeah, me too.

35:18.003 --> 35:19.003
So okay?

35:19.955 --> 35:20.955
All right.

35:21.952 --> 35:24.112
- Thanks for asking.
- Of course.

35:42.603 --> 35:44.043
Why are you stopping?

35:45.236 --> 35:46.236
Hey.

35:46.654 --> 35:47.654
What's wrong?

35:49.534 --> 35:51.934
We should probably take this
somewhere a little more private.

35:52.230 --> 35:53.230
Yeah.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.850
How are you doing there, young lady?
Look at you.

36:14.955 --> 36:16.355
- Hey, old man.
- Hey.

36:16.823 --> 36:18.223
I'm tired but feeling good.

36:18.392 --> 36:20.312
- How are you doing?
- Been better.

36:20.449 --> 36:22.049
Yeah. You all right?

36:22.571 --> 36:23.421
Let's go.

36:23.524 --> 36:25.004
Now let's do what you came to do.

36:31.216 --> 36:32.496
So what brings you to Prescott?

36:32.732 --> 36:34.852
I got a feeling
there's more to the story.

36:35.888 --> 36:37.858
Got a feeling you're not just down
on a little hunting trip.

36:37.859 --> 36:39.219
It's my daughter, Abbey.

36:39.529 --> 36:43.689
She has been talking to this guy online
for two years.

36:43.808 --> 36:44.808
I had no idea.

36:44.921 --> 36:47.481
She turned 16 and jumps in the car
to go meet him.

36:47.593 --> 36:49.153
She must really be in love with him.

36:49.267 --> 36:51.707
She's 16.
She doesn't know anything about love.

36:52.343 --> 36:55.063
Besides, I have a feeling there's
something more sinister going on.

36:56.027 --> 36:57.547
- Sinister?
- Yup.

36:57.651 --> 36:58.691
That's a strong word.

36:58.788 --> 36:59.788
He's 23.

37:00.288 --> 37:02.968
You sure you don't wanna
maybe just break his legs?

37:03.260 --> 37:04.180
That's why I'm here.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.433
Yeah, well, you can do
a hell of a lot more

37:06.523 --> 37:07.883
with what I brought you.

37:12.296 --> 37:13.736
Oh, great. Check it out.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.299
- Is that what you're looking for?
- That's exactly what I'm looking for.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.820
- Do you have the rifle?
- Yeah.

37:22.394 --> 37:23.874
That's in the bag too.

37:25.165 --> 37:29.005
Then you got all your ammo is in the case.
You got an M15 back there.

37:29.698 --> 37:31.307
Do you really need to pack
this much heat?

37:31.308 --> 37:33.348
It's better to be safe
than sorry, right?

37:34.226 --> 37:35.226
Yes.

37:35.933 --> 37:37.693
Tell you something, Julia.

37:37.959 --> 37:41.439
Ever since I retired from the agency,
life has been great.

37:41.675 --> 37:43.115
The biggest trouble I've got

37:43.207 --> 37:47.087
is maybe fixing a leaky roof
or a broken fan belt.

37:47.634 --> 37:51.634
Well, I'm glad to hear that, Morty,
but trouble seems to follow me.

37:51.879 --> 37:54.879
Yeah? Well, don't use any of that
unless you have to.

37:55.030 --> 37:57.310
Because I need somebody
to take care of me in my old age.

37:58.674 --> 38:01.186
Okay? I'm meeting a buddy of mine
at Ed's Diner

38:01.276 --> 38:02.556
so you borrow my truck

38:02.836 --> 38:04.636
and I'll have my buddy
give me a ride home.

38:05.144 --> 38:06.424
All right. Here it is.

38:28.403 --> 38:29.403
All right.

38:30.077 --> 38:31.437
You sure about this?

38:31.974 --> 38:35.854
I'm happy to help you any time, okay?
You ever need anything, you call me.

38:35.968 --> 38:37.044
All right. Thank you.

38:37.134 --> 38:39.164
No. No, you don't thank me. I thank you.

38:39.254 --> 38:40.974
You're the one that saved my life,
remember?

38:41.082 --> 38:42.911
Yeah, well, it was part of the job.

38:43.001 --> 38:45.601
Yeah, not everybody does their job
the way you do.

38:46.108 --> 38:48.828
- I'm forever grateful, all right?
- Yeah.

38:49.165 --> 38:51.565
So enough of the sappy stuff.

38:52.602 --> 38:53.737
You got my truck.

38:53.827 --> 38:55.747
I'd like to get it back
without any bullet holes.

38:55.907 --> 38:56.757
Okay.

38:56.850 --> 38:58.490
- You need anything, you call me.
- Deal.

38:59.294 --> 39:00.294
Thank you.

39:12.364 --> 39:13.913
You won't believe this.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.643
<i>I can believe anything right now.</i>

39:15.750 --> 39:17.738
So we were able to extrude
some information

39:17.828 --> 39:20.188
based off the sites and passwords
you gave us, right?

39:20.680 --> 39:23.080
And it appears that Gavin Brown
had been logging

39:23.189 --> 39:27.389
into his chatterama.com account
from... Are you ready for this?

39:28.228 --> 39:30.628
At this point,
I prepared myself for anything.

39:31.904 --> 39:34.824
From inside of the Arizona State
Correctional Institution.

39:35.129 --> 39:37.089
Great. My daughter is with a convict.

39:37.309 --> 39:39.069
Were you expecting anything different?

39:39.530 --> 39:40.997
But here's the thing.
There hasn't been any activity

39:40.998 --> 39:42.838
on the account for the past month,

39:43.011 --> 39:46.171
and now she's planning on meeting with him
so it appears that he's been let out.

39:46.902 --> 39:48.542
How did he have access from prison?

39:49.486 --> 39:52.406
Sadly, these prisoners get access
to their social media

39:52.506 --> 39:55.546
from prison libraries,
cell phones being smuggled in,

39:56.002 --> 39:58.322
guards giving them access.
You name it, they'll find a way.

39:58.651 --> 40:00.411
Now, this is a standard ruse
these prisoners run

40:00.412 --> 40:02.223
in order to get a girlfriend
while they're in jail

40:02.224 --> 40:03.855
and have someone to see
when they get out.

40:03.856 --> 40:05.616
But how did he find her specifically?

40:06.192 --> 40:07.312
Probably by random.

40:07.501 --> 40:09.285
You know, what these guys do
is they send out their feelers

40:09.286 --> 40:10.646
to hundreds of young girls, right?

40:10.702 --> 40:11.700
It's called catfishing.

40:11.790 --> 40:14.270
Now, all it takes
is for just one of them to bite.

40:14.364 --> 40:16.004
Well, she bit all right.

40:16.666 --> 40:17.826
Where should I start looking?

40:18.322 --> 40:20.402
Well, I would start
with their original meeting point

40:20.428 --> 40:21.730
at the restaurant in Prescott.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.180
In the meantime, I'll go
through some of the prison's videos

40:24.253 --> 40:26.373
and mugshots,
cross-reference it with his photos.

40:26.563 --> 40:27.603
Thanks, Martin.

40:27.998 --> 40:28.998
Hey, Julia.

40:29.133 --> 40:31.293
Listen, this is
your daughter, all right?

40:32.090 --> 40:33.410
There's nothing more important.

40:33.865 --> 40:34.865
Thank you.

40:39.384 --> 40:40.824
How'd you become such a good kisser?

40:41.826 --> 40:42.826
I don't know.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.880
I haven't had much practice.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.547
Well, you got great instincts.

40:51.159 --> 40:52.159
Thanks.

41:10.029 --> 41:11.469
It looks so peaceful.

41:13.227 --> 41:14.347
There's a lot of character.

41:18.485 --> 41:20.245
I bet there's a lot
of family history here.

41:21.535 --> 41:23.295
My mother was actually born
in this house.

41:23.764 --> 41:24.764
Wow.

41:25.039 --> 41:26.479
I bet you played right on the steps.

41:27.697 --> 41:28.817
You're very intuitive.

41:29.305 --> 41:31.665
I actually spent a lot of hours
playing with my father here.

41:32.388 --> 41:35.148
Do I get to meet your parents?
I don't even know anything about them.

41:36.550 --> 41:39.030
Unfortunately, they're no longer around.

41:40.110 --> 41:42.550
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:42.653 --> 41:44.813
I guess, that's why you never talked
about them.

41:48.649 --> 41:49.649
What happened?

41:50.246 --> 41:52.086
- My father was killed.
- Killed?

41:54.012 --> 41:55.572
Was he in the military?

41:57.779 --> 41:59.139
Something like that.

42:02.669 --> 42:07.029
He was actually murdered
in the line of duty by his own partner.

42:08.471 --> 42:09.791
- Was it an accident?
- No.

42:10.837 --> 42:12.117
Definitely not an accident.

42:14.389 --> 42:15.389
I'm so sorry.

42:16.323 --> 42:18.203
And then my mother died
a couple of years later.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.200
How'd she die?

42:22.793 --> 42:24.433
Hm, she was diagnosed with cancer

42:24.546 --> 42:26.586
but I think that she died
of a broken heart.

42:27.750 --> 42:28.750
That's so sad.

42:29.725 --> 42:30.805
I'm so sorry, Gavin.

42:33.342 --> 42:34.862
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

42:36.747 --> 42:39.107
It's funny, though, how that stuff
never seems to leave you.

42:41.507 --> 42:42.507
Trust me...

42:44.995 --> 42:45.995
I know.

42:48.118 --> 42:49.118
Yeah?

42:51.306 --> 42:53.786
My father was murdered
when I was just 6 years old.

42:54.151 --> 42:55.191
You never told me that.

42:55.572 --> 42:56.572
I was afraid to.

42:56.879 --> 42:58.919
I thought you might not like me.

43:01.069 --> 43:02.069
That's silly.

43:04.104 --> 43:05.264
That's so...

43:07.126 --> 43:09.478
I gotta be honest.
That's exactly what I thought.

43:09.568 --> 43:12.207
That's why I was always Mr. Inspiring
and Mr. Optimistic,

43:12.297 --> 43:14.697
because I didn't want you to think
I was a depressing person.

43:15.084 --> 43:18.168
I'm sorry you had to deal
with all the stories of teenage angst.

43:18.258 --> 43:20.984
No, no, no. I liked it.

43:21.074 --> 43:24.154
I like being able to help you.

43:25.617 --> 43:26.617
Well, you did.

43:28.179 --> 43:30.692
You did because if it wasn't for you,

43:30.782 --> 43:33.422
I don't think I would have gotten
through the last couple of years.

43:34.316 --> 43:35.676
When my mom married Daniel

43:37.013 --> 43:40.973
and my dad died, it was devastating.

43:42.685 --> 43:45.605
Devastating and when my mom
married Daniel it was like...

43:49.566 --> 43:51.846
It was like the dagger going straight
through my heart.

44:01.634 --> 44:03.274
How did your father die?

44:07.151 --> 44:08.871
Do you really wanna know?

44:11.202 --> 44:13.522
I wanna know everything about you.

44:15.987 --> 44:19.402
It was 10 years ago,
and I remember everything so clearly

44:19.492 --> 44:20.732
like it was yesterday.

44:21.996 --> 44:23.996
My dad and I brought my mom
to the airport

44:24.856 --> 44:26.256
because she had a business trip.

44:30.049 --> 44:31.089
Oh my God.

44:32.532 --> 44:34.332
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I guess so.

44:37.043 --> 44:39.323
God. Daddy's gotta go talk
to this guy, okay?

44:39.733 --> 44:42.173
It's okay. No, no, it's okay.
I'll be right back.

44:42.285 --> 44:44.565
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll be right back, okay?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.396
Look, you can see me right
through the window.

44:46.397 --> 44:47.757
Well, in just a second.

44:47.853 --> 44:49.053
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

44:49.346 --> 44:50.864
Okay? All right.

44:50.954 --> 44:52.794
Just stay there. Be right back.

44:54.620 --> 44:56.940
What are you doing, man?
You slammed on your brakes.

45:08.489 --> 45:10.043
I got, okay, I got my card.

45:10.133 --> 45:11.453
Here's my driver's license.

45:11.744 --> 45:13.904
I need to get my registration
out of my car, okay?

45:20.682 --> 45:21.682
Daddy.

45:36.099 --> 45:36.938
Dad.

45:37.028 --> 45:38.028
Daddy.

46:18.482 --> 46:19.482
Daddy.

46:46.142 --> 46:47.142
Daddy?

46:51.058 --> 46:52.098
Wake up, Daddy.

46:59.592 --> 47:00.592
Where are we?

47:01.293 --> 47:03.093
We're inside his van.

47:09.389 --> 47:10.389
Who are you?

47:13.254 --> 47:14.414
Why are you doing this?

47:20.137 --> 47:21.217
Did he hurt you?

47:22.078 --> 47:23.318
Are you all right?

47:27.485 --> 47:29.120
I thought you were dead.

47:29.210 --> 47:32.410
Oh, Daddy's fine
and I'm gonna be all right, okay?

47:33.461 --> 47:36.941
Listen, we gotta get out of this van,
all right?

47:40.003 --> 47:44.003
I promise you
it's gonna be all right, okay?

47:45.152 --> 47:46.152
Okay.

48:02.609 --> 48:04.449
Run, Abbey, run!

48:04.794 --> 48:06.194
Run and hide! Run!

48:07.698 --> 48:08.778
Run hard!

49:26.419 --> 49:27.939
Daddy!

49:28.611 --> 49:30.251
Don't leave me!

49:31.088 --> 49:32.328
Daddy!

49:42.393 --> 49:43.393
I'm so sorry.

49:45.638 --> 49:47.278
My father was found in the woods,

49:49.610 --> 49:55.970
bound and gagged
and shot right in the head.

49:56.449 --> 49:59.889
- Who could do such a thing?
- Only an animal could do that.

50:01.814 --> 50:04.527
My mom and I had
a really close relationship

50:04.617 --> 50:06.137
before she married Daniel.

50:06.785 --> 50:09.208
She married him just like that?
Must have been very insensitive of her.

50:09.209 --> 50:10.729
Oh, yeah, it was insensitive.

50:11.490 --> 50:14.684
You know, he came right in
and tried to control everything

50:14.774 --> 50:17.094
and on top of that,
his two kids are brats.

50:19.749 --> 50:21.669
Well, you don't have to worry
about that anymore.

50:22.740 --> 50:23.820
And why is that?

50:24.114 --> 50:25.394
Because you have me.

50:27.232 --> 50:28.672
How'd I get so lucky?

50:32.823 --> 50:34.543
We were just meant to be.

50:39.167 --> 50:40.109
- Hey.
- What?

50:40.199 --> 50:41.279
Let's check out the inside.

50:41.477 --> 50:43.077
Get over here. Come on.

50:44.851 --> 50:47.141
Would you guys be okay
with peanut butter and jelly?

50:47.231 --> 50:48.591
We had it for lunch.

50:49.091 --> 50:50.091
Oh, it's Mom.

50:50.405 --> 50:52.845
So don't say anything
about sitting on the counter, okay?

50:54.504 --> 50:55.944
Hey, honey, you okay?

50:56.128 --> 50:57.749
Hey, don't worry about me, okay?

50:57.839 --> 51:01.159
Just keep monitoring the phones
and contact all of her friends.

51:01.254 --> 51:05.494
Just tell them if she contacts them,
to call you immediately, all right?

51:05.980 --> 51:06.980
Okay, I will.

51:08.068 --> 51:09.428
- I love you.
- I love you too.

51:09.530 --> 51:11.250
- And Daniel?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

51:11.667 --> 51:14.102
Look, keep the kids close,

51:14.192 --> 51:16.352
and don't go to any public places
right now, all right?

51:16.834 --> 51:18.794
I don't understand. Why, Julia?

51:19.099 --> 51:20.459
Just a safety precaution.

51:20.938 --> 51:24.178
Okay, I'll be careful.
You be careful too.

51:29.369 --> 51:30.489
Okay, yeah.

51:31.328 --> 51:32.648
Did you save some cookies for me?

51:34.515 --> 51:36.555
How about cookies for
dinner instead? Really?

52:01.346 --> 52:02.946
Hello. How can I help you?

52:03.327 --> 52:05.247
I'm looking for a guy named Gavin Brown.

52:05.445 --> 52:06.445
I don't know him.

52:06.545 --> 52:07.382
Are you sure?

52:07.472 --> 52:09.272
I've worked here for five years.
I would know.

52:09.782 --> 52:10.782
Okay.

52:11.236 --> 52:14.196
Look, here's some pictures.
Maybe that'll help.

52:15.873 --> 52:17.033
Let me see those pictures.

52:19.362 --> 52:21.722
I could swear he was in here
this morning with a young girl.

52:22.751 --> 52:23.911
Was it this girl?

52:25.518 --> 52:26.918
Could be. That looks like her.

52:27.185 --> 52:28.185
Are they in trouble?

52:29.118 --> 52:31.182
This is my daughter
and she ran away to be with him

52:31.272 --> 52:33.352
so, yes, they are in trouble.

52:33.638 --> 52:36.278
- Well, I saw them leave in a red car.
- Right.

52:36.393 --> 52:38.433
- Did you see where they went?
- No.

52:38.537 --> 52:41.697
They talked outside for a little while
and then they took off together.

52:42.250 --> 52:43.255
I didn't see them drive off

52:43.256 --> 52:45.176
but they weren't on the sidewalk
for too long.

52:47.473 --> 52:49.193
You know, here's my card.

52:50.023 --> 52:52.503
Call me if you think of anything
or if they come back in, okay?

52:53.162 --> 52:54.162
Of course.

52:54.627 --> 52:57.307
I've got a daughter too. I understand.

52:58.273 --> 52:59.273
Thanks.

53:06.813 --> 53:08.293
Ma'am. Hey, ma'am.

53:09.123 --> 53:10.243
I might be able to help you.

53:10.848 --> 53:12.008
I appreciate the help.

53:12.289 --> 53:13.729
That man you were looking for.

53:14.021 --> 53:15.301
He was definitely here today.

53:15.405 --> 53:16.565
- Was he?
- Yup.

53:16.927 --> 53:19.447
He met with your daughter here
just a couple hours ago.

53:19.564 --> 53:20.414
Gavin Brown?

53:20.543 --> 53:22.528
Oh, that... That ain't his name.

53:22.618 --> 53:24.138
What? What do you mean?

53:24.234 --> 53:26.034
His name is Wesley Sherman.

53:27.209 --> 53:28.529
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

53:28.634 --> 53:29.834
Known him since middle school.

53:30.252 --> 53:32.412
That boy has always been up to no good.

53:32.845 --> 53:34.965
I never liked him.
He's always just a big bully.

53:35.764 --> 53:37.204
Did you know him too?

53:37.360 --> 53:38.560
I might have known his father.

53:38.845 --> 53:40.085
Yeah, he wasn't so nice either.

53:40.138 --> 53:40.858
He was an ex-cop.

53:40.974 --> 53:43.094
Word around town is he was killed
in the line of duty.

53:43.981 --> 53:46.221
- Did you know him?
- No, I guess I didn't.

53:46.711 --> 53:47.951
How do I find Wesley Sherman?

53:48.159 --> 53:50.519
I think he lives alone on a ranch out
toward Sweet.

53:50.906 --> 53:54.226
Right at the intersection of Highway 52
and the Sweet Alder Highway.

53:54.324 --> 53:55.141
You can't miss it.

53:55.231 --> 53:57.111
- Ain't nothing else out there.
- Thanks.

53:58.069 --> 53:59.069
Hey, ma'am?

54:00.110 --> 54:01.550
Be careful out there.

54:01.665 --> 54:03.705
That boy has got lots of guns.

54:04.575 --> 54:05.935
He's also got my little girl.

54:58.273 --> 54:59.273
Abbey.

55:14.561 --> 55:15.561
Abbey.

55:55.683 --> 55:56.683
Abbey.

56:03.275 --> 56:04.275
Abbey.

56:14.418 --> 56:15.418
Abbey.

56:36.670 --> 56:37.990
<i>- Julia?</i>
- Martin?

56:38.286 --> 56:39.612
Hey, I still haven't found anything.

56:39.613 --> 56:41.693
Did Wesley Sherman have a son?

56:43.060 --> 56:44.980
I don't know.
I think he had a few children. Why?

56:45.026 --> 56:47.226
Did he name his oldest son
Wesley Junior?

56:47.669 --> 56:50.102
I mean, honestly,
that case has been so long ago

56:50.192 --> 56:52.272
but, yeah,
I remember something like that. Why?

56:52.744 --> 56:57.776
This is gonna sound crazy
but I think Wesley Junior killed Lucas,

56:57.866 --> 56:58.946
and I think he's got Abbey.

56:58.995 --> 56:59.995
Oh, no.

57:05.494 --> 57:11.694
Bingo. There's a Wesley Sherman Junior
at 3003 Capteer Road over in Prescott.

57:12.409 --> 57:14.169
It's on the other side of Prescott,
damn it.

57:14.427 --> 57:15.427
Thanks. Bye.

57:23.209 --> 57:26.369
Thanks, Jed. I have no problem
to kept her busy for a while.

57:40.221 --> 57:41.221
Who was that?

57:41.886 --> 57:42.886
It was a buddy of mine.

57:43.467 --> 57:45.050
He wanted to know
if I wanted to go out tonight

57:45.051 --> 57:46.971
but I told him I had much better plans.

57:56.613 --> 57:57.613
- Hi.
- Hey.

58:04.268 --> 58:05.748
God, you're beautiful.

58:12.995 --> 58:14.555
I can't believe I'm with you right now.

58:18.206 --> 58:19.206
Not yet.

58:20.094 --> 58:21.094
Not yet.

58:21.390 --> 58:22.390
Why?

58:22.761 --> 58:23.921
Because it's too soon.

58:24.032 --> 58:26.243
It's not too soon. I've been waiting
for this moment for two years.

58:26.244 --> 58:28.164
I wanna make love to you. I do.

58:30.213 --> 58:31.533
Okay, it's just... No.

58:32.936 --> 58:34.936
I haven't done it before.

58:37.403 --> 58:38.483
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

58:42.397 --> 58:44.077
I'm gonna be really gentle with you.

58:56.603 --> 58:57.603
I don't know.

58:59.162 --> 59:00.682
I don't know. I don't know.

59:01.654 --> 59:05.774
Why don't you stop thinking for a second
and just kiss me.

59:09.306 --> 59:10.306
Feel the moment.

59:13.449 --> 59:15.369
And it'll just happen, okay?

59:17.281 --> 59:20.241
Trust me, I have a lot of experience here
and I'm gonna make you feel safe.

59:20.505 --> 59:21.625
What about protection?

59:23.361 --> 59:24.361
Protection?

59:24.576 --> 59:26.402
We don't... We don't need protection,

59:26.492 --> 59:28.252
and you can't get pregnant
on the first time.

59:29.124 --> 59:29.957
I can't?

59:30.047 --> 59:32.167
No, of course not.
It's just an old wives' tale.

59:32.356 --> 59:33.356
Is it really?

59:33.896 --> 59:34.896
Yes, really.

59:35.881 --> 59:37.161
Hey, what about diseases?

59:41.020 --> 59:42.580
- Do you have any diseases?
- No.

59:43.133 --> 59:44.342
Okay, neither do I.

59:44.432 --> 59:45.872
Can you not destroy the moment?

59:58.906 --> 59:59.906
Please be gentle.

01:00:01.777 --> 01:00:02.777
I will.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.415
This is... Is this your room?

01:00:18.862 --> 01:00:19.862
Of course it is.

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.410
Then who's Wesley?

01:00:24.735 --> 01:00:26.615
- Wesley?
- Yeah.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.780
I see the name Wesley
all over this room.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:32.555
Yeah, my dad's name was Wesley.

01:00:33.803 --> 01:00:36.563
But why would your dad's name
be all over your room?

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.500
Because it is.
Is it really that big of a deal?

01:00:41.737 --> 01:00:42.737
Please stop.

01:00:43.548 --> 01:00:44.398
Why?

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:46.630
Because it's too soon.
I don't feel comfortable.

01:00:52.288 --> 01:00:53.328
Maybe this is a bad idea.

01:00:53.437 --> 01:00:56.677
No, no. It wasn't.
I'm just not ready to have sex yet.

01:00:57.907 --> 01:01:00.758
If you're not ready to have sex, then
you're not ready for a relationship.

01:01:00.759 --> 01:01:01.799
No, no, no.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:03.716
Just give me some time, okay?

01:01:04.354 --> 01:01:06.765
I'm a... I'm a girl.
I like to take things slow.

01:01:06.855 --> 01:01:08.055
There's no rush, Gavin.

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:13.370
Can you just be gentle with me
and I promise in time we'll make love.

01:01:15.186 --> 01:01:18.066
I love you. And I don't...

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:22.885
And I don't want to hurt our chances
of being together forever.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.312
Yeah.

01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:29.589
Yeah, I'm sorry. I hadn't...

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:34.564
I just can't believe
that you're here right now.

01:01:48.214 --> 01:01:49.214
Gavin?

01:01:49.693 --> 01:01:50.713
Where'd you go?

01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:06.017
- Hey.
- Hey, what time is it?

01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:12.071
- It's 11.
- Wow. I slept for a long time, huh?

01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:14.117
Guess the drive really exhausted you.

01:02:14.755 --> 01:02:16.475
Yeah, I'm not used
to staying up all night.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:19.828
What are you doing?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.507
Just getting a little work done.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.723
Why don't you stay asleep
a little longer?

01:02:28.335 --> 01:02:29.455
And I'll be in, in a bit.

01:04:13.639 --> 01:04:16.799
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:04:17.082 --> 01:04:18.082
Nothing?

01:04:21.699 --> 01:04:23.219
Going through my wallet isn't nothing.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.060
- You're dressed.
- Yeah, it's cold.

01:04:26.387 --> 01:04:27.339
Mm, it's cold?

01:04:27.444 --> 01:04:29.164
Yeah, I'm curious about something.

01:04:29.263 --> 01:04:31.063
- What's that?
- About who Wesley is.

01:04:31.169 --> 01:04:32.969
I already told you,
Wesley's my father's name.

01:04:33.363 --> 01:04:35.883
Then why does
your driver's license say "Wesley"

01:04:36.071 --> 01:04:37.431
and why did you text my mother?

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.725
Do I really have to point it out to you?

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.180
You don't have to say anything.

01:04:42.969 --> 01:04:44.193
But I want you to.

01:04:45.189 --> 01:04:47.004
I want you to feel like
you can be honest with me.

01:04:47.005 --> 01:04:48.845
- But I am being honest.
- No, you're not.

01:04:50.121 --> 01:04:52.401
Your name's Gavin
and your driver's license says Wesley.

01:04:56.564 --> 01:04:57.804
You know everything about me

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:03.120
and I'm beginning to feel like
you're not who you say you are.

01:05:03.728 --> 01:05:04.768
Well, who could I be?

01:05:06.144 --> 01:05:07.144
I don't know.

01:05:08.163 --> 01:05:09.163
But you're not Gavin.

01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:11.531
Okay, you got me. I'm not.

01:05:12.932 --> 01:05:15.367
Gavin Brown is an alias
that I came up with

01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:16.777
for my Chatter page, all right?

01:05:16.867 --> 01:05:18.220
I didn't like my old name
so I changed it.

01:05:18.221 --> 01:05:21.621
I used to be Wesley Sherman
but now, I am Gavin.

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:24.313
Is there anything wrong with that?

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:27.342
- What are you hiding from?
- My past.

01:05:29.027 --> 01:05:32.437
Okay, after my father was murdered,
I was put into foster homes,

01:05:32.527 --> 01:05:34.207
and I went from foster home
to foster home.

01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:35.957
And I was abused,
mentally and physically.

01:05:36.047 --> 01:05:36.841
Yeah.

01:05:36.931 --> 01:05:39.611
Now, I'm opening up to you
and you're being so insensitive.

01:05:40.128 --> 01:05:41.074
Why do you have a letter

01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:42.438
from the Arizona Department
of Correctional Administration?

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.479
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:44.867 --> 01:05:47.587
Abbey, we all make mistakes

01:05:48.855 --> 01:05:51.265
all right? So I made a couple
of mistakes when I was young

01:05:51.355 --> 01:05:53.787
and I got in trouble,
and now they keep tabs on me, all right?

01:05:53.788 --> 01:05:56.228
- I'm not perfect. We are not perfect.
- Okay, I know.

01:05:57.332 --> 01:06:00.000
But I came here thinking one thing
and now it's changing.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.130
What is changing?

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.939
I'm the same person
that's been messaging you

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.980
for the last two years.

01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:05.933
How do I know that?

01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:11.508
It's just a chance
you're gonna have to take.

01:06:14.732 --> 01:06:17.572
I mean, that's the nature of love.
One person falls in love with another

01:06:17.657 --> 01:06:22.017
and they end up going out on a ride
that they can only hope ends happily.

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.539
All right.

01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:26.309
Hey, I love you.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.989
And we were meant to be together.

01:06:31.081 --> 01:06:33.462
Age, name, places,
none of that stuff matters.

01:06:33.552 --> 01:06:35.036
All that matters is that
we were two people

01:06:35.037 --> 01:06:37.517
searching for the same thing,
and we found it in each other.

01:06:40.546 --> 01:06:41.546
Yeah?

01:06:44.798 --> 01:06:46.518
Just don't push me like that.

01:06:47.664 --> 01:06:48.888
Or you'll do what?

01:06:51.872 --> 01:06:53.392
Well, I'll have to tell you the truth.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.260
The truth about what?

01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:57.998
I said don't push me.

01:06:58.406 --> 01:06:59.246
- Come on.
- No, okay.

01:06:59.301 --> 01:07:01.061
Look, what are you not telling me?

01:07:01.776 --> 01:07:03.027
Do you have any secrets?

01:07:03.117 --> 01:07:05.237
Do you have a family
that you're not telling me about?

01:07:05.284 --> 01:07:07.604
Do you have a girlfriend?
Are you a murderer?

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.362
Why did you go to jail?

01:07:17.765 --> 01:07:19.325
You told me that you loved me.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.040
Why are you acting like this?

01:07:23.359 --> 01:07:24.583
Trying to explain.

01:07:41.105 --> 01:07:42.105
Abbey.

01:08:27.719 --> 01:08:29.158
This is familiar, isn't it?

01:09:17.127 --> 01:09:18.207
Please, no!

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.300
No! No, no, no!

01:09:23.053 --> 01:09:25.332
No, no! No!

01:09:30.613 --> 01:09:31.973
That's a very nice try, Abbey.

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.139
No.

01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:40.831
Stop!

01:09:41.184 --> 01:09:42.184
Did you text somebody?

01:09:42.966 --> 01:09:44.366
- No!
- No?

01:09:45.143 --> 01:09:47.622
Well, then, who could that be?

01:09:48.841 --> 01:09:49.841
"Mommy."

01:09:51.072 --> 01:09:52.952
"Don't worry, sweetie,
I will be there soon."

01:09:53.716 --> 01:09:54.717
Does that comfort you?

01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:55.901
What is going on?

01:09:56.212 --> 01:09:57.431
Who are you?

01:09:57.521 --> 01:09:58.561
It's not time yet.

01:09:59.148 --> 01:10:01.096
What are you... Wasn't time for what?

01:10:01.186 --> 01:10:04.426
It is not time for you to know who I am.

01:10:05.032 --> 01:10:10.312
Don't worry, pretty soon you
and your mom will know exactly who I am.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.576
What the hell are you talking about?

01:10:12.922 --> 01:10:14.962
What the hell are you talking about?

01:10:15.429 --> 01:10:16.429
Stop.

01:10:41.929 --> 01:10:43.329
Morty, call the police right now.

01:10:43.437 --> 01:10:46.437
Tell them to meet me
with a large force at Lincoln Mine.

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:47.630
<i>You all right?</i>

01:10:47.919 --> 01:10:49.799
No, I'm in pursuit of Wesley Sherman.

01:10:50.358 --> 01:10:51.378
He's got Abbey.

01:10:51.971 --> 01:10:52.971
<i>You got it.</i>

01:10:55.198 --> 01:10:56.627
You killed my father.

01:10:56.727 --> 01:10:58.887
Oh my God, how can you do
something like that?

01:10:58.998 --> 01:11:01.038
Stupid naive little girl,

01:11:01.152 --> 01:11:04.112
I've been planning this
ever since that day you got away.

01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:05.568
Do you not remember?

01:11:07.012 --> 01:11:09.972
Run, Abbey, run! Run and hide.

01:11:10.092 --> 01:11:12.092
Run! Run! Hide!

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:25.190
- Hey. You are gonna get us killed.
- What's the difference?

01:11:25.492 --> 01:11:26.803
You're gonna kill me anyways.

01:11:26.893 --> 01:11:28.373
Yeah, well, that was the plan.

01:11:29.216 --> 01:11:30.416
But now I haven't decided yet.

01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:34.863
See, now that Mommy's in town,
I'm thinking maybe I'll kill her

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:38.678
and let you live without parents
just like I had to.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.566
What are you talking about?

01:11:40.656 --> 01:11:42.736
Abbey. You're not paying attention.

01:11:43.643 --> 01:11:46.563
Your mother murdered my father.

01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:47.786
What? What?

01:11:47.931 --> 01:11:50.246
Your mother and my father
were on the force together.

01:11:50.336 --> 01:11:53.376
Your mother went rogue
and murdered my father.

01:11:53.472 --> 01:11:55.098
My mom would never
do anything like that.

01:11:55.099 --> 01:11:58.139
No? Then why did she marry Daniel
right after your father died?

01:12:04.259 --> 01:12:05.939
"After my father died." You killed him.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.960
Finally, a little quiet.

01:13:46.933 --> 01:13:51.600
No, no... I've no idea
what's going on that time.

01:13:51.609 --> 01:13:52.609
Wesley.

01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:54.370
Let her go.

01:13:54.481 --> 01:13:57.761
Look, we don't need
to get anybody else involved, okay?

01:13:57.949 --> 01:13:59.309
I just want my daughter back.

01:13:59.463 --> 01:14:01.880
Look, I know this is about the revenge
of your father's death

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.290
but you don't know the truth.

01:14:03.692 --> 01:14:04.772
He was a good guy.

01:14:04.957 --> 01:14:08.477
He was my partner, but he let
the money get the best of him.

01:14:10.609 --> 01:14:11.609
He went bad.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.220
We were chasing a suspect.

01:14:21.114 --> 01:14:22.514
FBI. Freeze.

01:15:36.956 --> 01:15:38.316
FBI! Stop!

01:15:48.636 --> 01:15:49.996
Back-up's on the way.

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:52.046
Make it easy on yourself.

01:16:01.825 --> 01:16:03.225
- Julia?
- You got it?

01:16:03.594 --> 01:16:05.074
I got him. Put your gun down.

01:16:05.226 --> 01:16:06.226
Where is he?

01:16:07.635 --> 01:16:09.755
- He's not cuffed, Wesley.
- Put down your gun.

01:16:09.862 --> 01:16:11.114
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're letting him go.

01:16:11.115 --> 01:16:13.294
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Put down your gun now!

01:16:13.295 --> 01:16:15.655
I'm your superior.
I don't take commands from you.

01:16:15.748 --> 01:16:17.060
Cuff him now, Wesley.

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:18.150
I'm sorry, Julia.

01:16:18.677 --> 01:16:19.637
It's not gonna happen.

01:16:19.727 --> 01:16:20.727
You've gone bad.

01:16:20.841 --> 01:16:22.241
Shoot her, man. She ain't nothing.

01:16:22.336 --> 01:16:23.216
Calm down.

01:16:23.414 --> 01:16:26.134
- I'm not gonna shoot her.
- You don't shoot her, we both go to jail.

01:16:26.157 --> 01:16:28.157
- There is no other option.
- There's an option.

01:16:28.393 --> 01:16:30.113
Cuff him now.

01:16:30.334 --> 01:16:32.254
Cuff him now, we'll work it out, okay?

01:16:32.365 --> 01:16:33.744
- Shoot her, Wesley!
- I'm not gonna shoot her.

01:16:33.745 --> 01:16:35.505
- Shoot her!
- I'm not gonna shoot her.

01:16:36.742 --> 01:16:37.742
Don't do this.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.077
Suspect fired his gun.

01:16:46.207 --> 01:16:47.447
I had no choice.

01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:49.051
Two of the bullets hit your father.

01:16:49.246 --> 01:16:50.926
No, no. That's not what happened.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:55.363
You killed my husband.

01:16:55.605 --> 01:16:57.405
You killed the father of my child.

01:16:57.495 --> 01:16:59.975
How much hurt
do you wanna create, Wesley?

01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:02.301
The world, Julia.

01:17:03.022 --> 01:17:05.805
I wanna create the same world of hurt
that you caused my family the day

01:17:05.806 --> 01:17:09.246
that you murdered my father.

01:17:10.523 --> 01:17:11.523
I had no choice.

01:17:11.621 --> 01:17:12.621
You're lying!

01:17:13.456 --> 01:17:15.616
Damn it. Okay.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:22.004
It's time.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400
No.

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.420
Get up.

01:17:33.785 --> 01:17:36.225
- Won't you say "Hi Mom."
- It's okay, baby.

01:17:36.469 --> 01:17:37.509
- It's okay.
- Come on.

01:17:39.678 --> 01:17:41.438
You hear that?
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

01:17:41.551 --> 01:17:43.071
I want you to watch your daughter die.

01:17:43.554 --> 01:17:45.714
I want you to suffer the way
that you made me suffer.

01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:48.330
We have suffered for 10 years.

01:17:48.757 --> 01:17:50.757
We will suffer
for the rest of our lives.

01:17:51.818 --> 01:17:53.257
- Is that enough?
- Almost.

01:17:53.347 --> 01:17:54.587
No, Gavin.

01:17:54.872 --> 01:17:56.472
Please, stop.

01:17:56.563 --> 01:17:58.637
My name's not Gavin.
Have you not been listening?

01:17:58.727 --> 01:18:00.286
No, no, no. No, to me, you're Gavin.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.976
I know underneath all this rage,
you're a beautiful man.

01:18:03.074 --> 01:18:04.274
Don't be so naive.

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.561
Gavin was created for the sole purpose
of bringing the two of you here today.

01:18:08.562 --> 01:18:09.562
I don't care.

01:18:09.757 --> 01:18:11.357
All I know is that underneath

01:18:12.144 --> 01:18:13.828
that you wouldn't have written
all those things

01:18:13.829 --> 01:18:14.821
if you didn't have a heart.

01:18:14.822 --> 01:18:16.705
Why don't you ask your mother?
If she had some heart.

01:18:16.706 --> 01:18:18.168
On the day that she killed my father.

01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:22.249
We can forgive you.
My mom and I understand the pain.

01:18:22.351 --> 01:18:23.671
- You understand the pain?
- Yeah.

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.860
You have to stop this now,
Gavin, please.

01:18:26.137 --> 01:18:26.994
You care about me.

01:18:27.084 --> 01:18:28.524
I... No, I don't care about you.

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:29.541
You love me.

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:30.998
Oh, no, I don't love you.

01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:33.030
- You love me!
- I do not love you!

01:18:43.572 --> 01:18:45.172
- Help me.
- You killed my father.

01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:47.661
You were gonna kill me.

01:18:48.415 --> 01:18:49.295
I love you.

01:18:49.428 --> 01:18:50.428
Go to hell.

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.837
- Freeze. FBI.
- Stand still.

01:19:07.927 --> 01:19:09.527
- Guys, guns down.
- It's over.

01:19:10.072 --> 01:19:11.072
It's over. Come on.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.317
Hey.

01:19:17.649 --> 01:19:18.649
Hold on.

01:19:20.392 --> 01:19:21.392
Hey.

01:19:23.087 --> 01:19:24.207
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.480
You got one brave mom.

01:19:33.756 --> 01:19:35.876
I promise I'll never go
on chatterama.com again.

01:19:37.045 --> 01:19:40.459
You're not gonna go on any social media
for the rest of your life, okay?

01:19:40.549 --> 01:19:43.069
Julia, you had me worried.

01:19:43.793 --> 01:19:45.313
No, you know, she was brave.

01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:46.626
No, I mean about my truck.

01:19:48.377 --> 01:19:50.857
You're gonna need a new set
of wheels, though, for sure.

01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:53.262
- No bullet holes?
- Yeah.

01:19:53.386 --> 01:19:54.551
Well, it's gonna need a clean-up.

01:19:54.552 --> 01:19:55.952
- Send me the bill.
- You got it.

01:19:56.069 --> 01:19:57.109
I'll leave you guys alone.

01:19:58.311 --> 01:19:59.311
Thanks, Morty.

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:00.610
Good work.

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:12.328
Thanks, Mom.

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:14.875
Of course.

01:20:33.866 --> 01:20:36.626
- So how are we gonna get my car home?
- Your car?

01:20:38.221 --> 01:20:39.066
Yeah.

01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:42.070
You're officially grounded, like,
'til you're 40 years old.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.865
Okay, but Mom, come on.

01:20:43.955 --> 01:20:45.549
Seriously?
After what we just went through?

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:47.590
Okay, okay, okay, I guess you're right.

01:20:48.254 --> 01:20:49.454
- Oh, yeah, I'm right.
- Yeah.

01:20:51.164 --> 01:20:53.524
Oh, there's a few people that wanna say
"Hi" to you.

01:20:59.207 --> 01:21:00.527
Oh, thanks, Mom.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.000
Morning.

01:21:17.116 --> 01:21:18.276
I was worried sick about you.

01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:19.253
I am so sorry, Janelle.

01:21:19.285 --> 01:21:21.508
I promise I won't do anything
to hurt our friendship again.

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:23.175
- You promise?
- I promise.

01:21:23.265 --> 01:21:25.985
- By the way, Bobby's here.
- No way. No boys until I'm 18.

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:27.082
How about never?

01:21:30.548 --> 01:21:32.108
- Hi.
- Did you catch the bad guy?

01:21:32.241 --> 01:21:33.561
Yeah, I always catch the bad guy.

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:35.748
We were so worried.

01:21:35.839 --> 01:21:38.639
Don't worry about me.
I'll always be here for my family.

01:21:39.763 --> 01:21:41.226
- Who wants cake and ice cream?
- Me.

01:21:41.316 --> 01:21:42.756
- Me.
- Me.
