02:17.971 --> 02:22.101
Dark Star November,
this is Gator 6. Return to base.

02:24.744 --> 02:28.703
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6.
Return to base.

02:43.029 --> 02:47.159
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.560
You look pale. Everything okay?

02:52.939 --> 02:54.270
Sean?

02:54.541 --> 02:55.530
Sean?

02:57.977 --> 02:59.103
Hey.

03:00.079 --> 03:01.706
Anyway, listen. I wanted to tell you.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.612
- God damn it!
- The only reason why I canceled...

03:05.885 --> 03:07.182
He's calling me three times a day.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.448
I hear more from him now than I did
when we were together.

03:09.656 --> 03:10.714
What is it with guys?

03:17.730 --> 03:19.595
I gave notice.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.190
- Ticket?
- Notice?

03:21.267 --> 03:22.632
May I see your ticket?

03:24.871 --> 03:25.860
I, uh...

03:34.480 --> 03:37.074
Hey. Hey.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.615
You're acting a little strange
this morning. You okay?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.619
- Ticket?
- Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

03:41.754 --> 03:42.743
We're gonna try, sir.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.655
Hey, Grandpa,
what the heck was the delay back there?

03:46.159 --> 03:47.751
I just punch the tickets, sir.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.824
I should punch your face.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.155
Sean? Did I do something?

03:52.799 --> 03:56.257
Look, I can see that you think you know me,
but I don't know who you are.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.804
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.

03:58.871 --> 04:02.500
I fly helicopters for the U.S. Army
in Afghanistan.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.176
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.713
Sean, that's...

04:08.414 --> 04:11.611
- Sean?
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

04:11.684 --> 04:12.844
I feel sick.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.521
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.122
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.887
Glenbrook Station.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.766
Hey, mister!

04:29.102 --> 04:32.071
- Hey!
- Glenbrook Station.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.264
Hey!

04:33.339 --> 04:34.931
You dropped this.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.202
Thanks.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.311
What is that?

04:49.889 --> 04:51.413
Chicago.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.890
All aboard.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.420
Doors are closing.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.668
This is a Chicago-bound train.

05:04.737 --> 05:08.104
You okay there, Captain?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.209
Next stop, Chicago.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.954
Union Station.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.319
Did you see that?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.526
You're kind of freaking me out.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.374
No.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.976
No, no, no, no.

06:19.178 --> 06:20.304
Are you all right?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.472
I don't know what's going on.

06:21.647 --> 06:22.636
Talk to me, Sean.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.183
Look, I don't know who Sean is.
And I don't know who you are.

06:33.259 --> 06:34.817
Okay. We'll get off at the next stop.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.718
We'll figure out
whatever's going on here, okay?

06:36.796 --> 06:37.854
This doesn't belong to me.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.625
Look at me. Everything's gonna be okay.

06:59.886 --> 07:03.151
Captain
Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.482
Captain Colter Stevens,
this is Beleaguered Castle.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.152
Acknowledge transmission.

07:13.466 --> 07:16.299
Captain Stevens, do you copy?

07:17.437 --> 07:18.836
Where am I?

07:19.405 --> 07:22.533
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Are you functional?

07:25.812 --> 07:28.280
I'm dizzy. Did I just A-lock?

07:28.347 --> 07:29.541
Adjusting your rotation.

07:33.319 --> 07:36.288
Can you report at this time?

07:38.558 --> 07:40.685
What is this? What is this?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.352
Where...

07:42.428 --> 07:44.362
Who am I talking to?

07:44.430 --> 07:45.988
Captain, report what you saw.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.991
What? I don't understand.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.865
Where were you
before you were talking to me?

07:52.505 --> 07:53.972
There was an explosion.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.167
Coming from where?

07:58.978 --> 08:02.675
Some confusion is perfectly normal
at this stage, Captain.

08:04.717 --> 08:07.208
Do you have a visual signal?

08:13.759 --> 08:14.748
Who are you?

08:15.728 --> 08:17.593
You already have that information, Captain.

08:18.197 --> 08:20.597
- I do?
- Recall my name.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.639
We'll rebuild the pattern. Try to focus.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.746
I...

08:35.815 --> 08:38.340
I was on a mission.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.351
I was flying,

08:40.419 --> 08:41.852
and then I woke up on a train.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.922
And now I'm here.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.021
I need to be briefed.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.254
What unit is this?

08:49.328 --> 08:50.727
You're with Beleaguered Castle.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.021
Who?

08:52.131 --> 08:55.259
Stand by for thread one
of alpha memory pattern.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.165
What is Beleaguered Castle?

08:57.503 --> 08:59.061
The exercises will assist you.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.097
Memory thread one.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.103
Listen to the following passage.

09:05.778 --> 09:09.236
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and opera cloak.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.476
"In her hand were five playing cards."

09:11.551 --> 09:12.779
- Is this a joke?
- "They were,

09:12.852 --> 09:14.786
"the queen of spades, four of clubs,

09:15.454 --> 09:16.751
"nine of clubs,

09:16.822 --> 09:19.052
"three of hearts, nine of hearts."

09:19.358 --> 09:21.724
- Is this a Red Flag exercise?
- End of thread one.

09:22.028 --> 09:25.657
Thread two. The following is a recording
of a Western Screech Owl.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.697
End of thread two.
End of pattern. Acknowledge.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.933
Acknowledge end of pattern.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.976
Stand by to initiate pattern recall.

09:38.044 --> 09:39.341
Go for pattern recall.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.936
Arrange the five playing cards

09:41.447 --> 09:43.915
in order of descending value,
irrespective of suit.

09:44.283 --> 09:47.116
- Queen, two nines, four and a three.
- That is correct.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.814
The passage I read contained mention
of a woman's name.

09:49.922 --> 09:50.946
What was that name?

09:51.023 --> 09:52.854
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.615
Recall my name.

09:57.663 --> 09:58.994
Goodwin. Your name's Goodwin.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.261
That is correct. Welcome back, Captain.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.315
Ma'am, I need to talk to my father.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.617
Has anybody been notified
that I'm stateside?

10:21.687 --> 10:23.018
Who bombed the train, Captain?

10:23.823 --> 10:24.915
What?

10:25.024 --> 10:26.013
Who bombed the train?

10:27.226 --> 10:28.716
A woman kept calling me Sean.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.920
That is incidental.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.528
Think, Captain. Remember back.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.357
Who bombed the train?

10:33.432 --> 10:35.491
I don't know who bombed
the goddamn train.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.368
- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?

10:38.671 --> 10:40.832
You will have eight minutes,
same as last time.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.138
No, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?

10:44.210 --> 10:45.575
I need to know where I am.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.738
What is the location
and condition of my crew?

10:48.414 --> 10:50.974
Does anybody know that I'm stateside?

10:51.784 --> 10:53.183
You are obligated
to give me this information.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.378
Start with the bomb.

10:54.453 --> 10:55.852
Where is it? What does it look like?

10:56.088 --> 10:57.851
What kind of explosive?
How is it detonated?

10:58.057 --> 10:59.615
- Right.
- Find the bomb,

10:59.692 --> 11:00.716
and you will find the bomber.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.091
Find the bomb. Wait, no, I...

11:16.976 --> 11:21.413
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.075
Okay. That's good.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.379
And I signed up for an LSAT course.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.552
Next thing you know,
I'll be moving to India to find myself.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.645
LSAT.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.521
Know any good gurus?

11:36.462 --> 11:38.623
She got your shoe.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.793
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?

11:42.868 --> 11:45.063
It's the same train, but it's different.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.099
Deep.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.869
I hope it's different. I feel the same way.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.440
What?

11:57.016 --> 11:58.779
- Do I have...
- Bryan.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.718
What is it with guys?
Everything's more beautiful in retrospect.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.250
What is...

12:05.324 --> 12:07.121
This looks so real.

12:07.193 --> 12:11.596
I think it's gonna be really good for me
to get as far away from him as possible.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.858
Unbelievable detail.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.457
Ticket? May I see your ticket?

12:24.877 --> 12:26.936
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.238
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.078
- Ticket?
- The distraction.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.979
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.314
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.513
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?

12:36.589 --> 12:39.456
Hey, Grandpa,
what the hell was the delay back there?

12:40.392 --> 12:42.417
- What are you late for?
- What?

12:42.495 --> 12:45.692
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

12:45.765 --> 12:48.734
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.826
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?

12:50.903 --> 12:51.995
Yeah.

12:52.204 --> 12:53.501
He is a comedian.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.236
Sit down.

12:56.642 --> 12:57.631
Freak.

12:58.477 --> 12:59.774
Fans.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.081
That's the guy.

13:03.649 --> 13:06.777
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.948
We talked about him.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.047
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.820
Glenbrook Station.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.191
Yeah, but by 1:00
the bridge is gonna be jammed.

13:18.397 --> 13:19.523
Damn it!

13:19.632 --> 13:20.963
I'm sorry.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.161
Just let me get it, okay?

13:29.909 --> 13:31.103
Hey, mister!

13:31.177 --> 13:32.542
Hey!

13:33.612 --> 13:35.705
Hey! You dropped this.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.844
Thanks.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.099
All aboard.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.594
Doors are closing.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.979
This is a Chicago-bound train.

14:15.487 --> 14:18.285
The explosion came from behind me.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.353
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.

14:25.431 --> 14:26.796
I got time for you.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.731
Next stop, Chicago.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.602
Union Station.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.473
Holy shit.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.728
Goodwin?

15:30.796 --> 15:33.560
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.360
Uh...

15:38.237 --> 15:40.603
Should I...

15:40.673 --> 15:43.733
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...

15:47.546 --> 15:48.843
Okay, um...

15:51.116 --> 15:53.710
I'm just gonna leave it.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.446
Okay?

16:06.498 --> 16:07.487
I'll be late.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.506
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.176
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,

16:27.252 --> 16:29.618
I need all of you to turn off
any personal electronic devices

16:29.688 --> 16:31.019
until we pull into the station, okay?

16:31.290 --> 16:34.453
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.756
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.297
Thank you. It's just a precautionary
measure. Nothing to worry about.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.864
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.663
Sir? Sir.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.097
Is there a problem here, sir?

16:47.706 --> 16:49.606
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.143
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?

16:52.211 --> 16:53.200
- Sean?
- Turn it off.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.307
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?

16:56.448 --> 16:57.437
Hey!

16:57.950 --> 16:59.645
Sean! What are you doing?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.850
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.

17:02.621 --> 17:03.713
That's not a good idea.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.347
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.

17:05.424 --> 17:06.584
He's not any more real than you are.

17:06.657 --> 17:09.058
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?

17:09.127 --> 17:10.321
Not gonna be a next time.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.073
Stabilize.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.286
Lower your pulse.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.549
Did you find the bomb?

17:45.130 --> 17:46.119
Yes.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.499
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.468
It's not a concern, Captain.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.302
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.812
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.315
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.543
That's irrelevant, Captain.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.414
I want to talk to your commanding officer!

18:07.519 --> 18:09.714
You can talk to him upon completion
of your mission.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.758
My mission is in Afghanistan,
where my unit is.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.090
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!

18:18.063 --> 18:20.258
You've been with us for two months.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.868
Did you ID the bomber?

18:25.537 --> 18:27.971
No. Where's my unit?

18:29.708 --> 18:32.802
And under whose jurisdiction
is this simulation?

18:32.878 --> 18:36.177
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.

18:36.982 --> 18:37.971
What lives?

18:39.218 --> 18:41.482
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.884
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.390
I need to be briefed.

18:56.668 --> 18:58.568
Sir, I need to give him something.

18:58.937 --> 18:59.961
That's fine. Go ahead.

19:00.038 --> 19:01.232
Okay.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.904
Get ready to send him back in.

19:05.577 --> 19:09.411
We're still waiting. Justin is trying to do
all the profiles right now.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.278
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time,

19:13.352 --> 19:16.048
a bomb exploded on a commuter train
outside of Chicago,

19:16.121 --> 19:18.589
killing everyone on board.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.557
And that's the train that you've been on.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.720
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.

19:24.029 --> 19:27.362
A man named Sean Fentress
was on that train.

19:27.432 --> 19:31.994
He, for all intents and
purposes, is now you.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.800
Every second spent explaining things

19:35.874 --> 19:37.842
puts more innocent civilians at risk.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.937
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion

19:41.013 --> 19:44.039
was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.609
Now, did you find the bomb?

19:49.054 --> 19:50.988
In the restroom.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.523
Ventilation panel above the sink.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.458
Cell phone detonator.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.355
Are we done?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.861
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.400
Good.

20:04.937 --> 20:10.102
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended
at the moment of the explosion.

20:10.175 --> 20:13.633
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered
to the cell tower nearest the train.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.010
So, one of those calls was made
by our bomber.

20:16.081 --> 20:19.778
Do you remember a freight train passing by
just before the explosion?

20:19.851 --> 20:21.512
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed

20:21.587 --> 20:22.986
to engulf the passing freight train,

20:23.055 --> 20:27.048
which means the bomber had to be watching
both trains when the call was made.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.953
Fifty-two callers.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.518
One of those is our bomber.

20:31.597 --> 20:35.363
I want you to concentrate on the passengers
in your car. Get to know them.

20:35.867 --> 20:39.496
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem

20:39.571 --> 20:42.131
quiet or withdrawn.

20:42.207 --> 20:44.869
Who seem nervous.

20:44.943 --> 20:46.570
As always, you will have eight minutes.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.810
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?

20:50.782 --> 20:52.340
Yes.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.681
I need you to discipline yourself
on this next pass.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.849
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.290
Everything else is irrelevant.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.452
Charge the drivers.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.655
Okay. Has my father even...

21:15.307 --> 21:16.569
I took your advice.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.534
It was very good advice.

21:22.247 --> 21:23.407
Watch it.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.074
You're kind of quiet today.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.640
Just got a lot on my mind.

21:26.718 --> 21:27.707
Careful.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.080
Yikes.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.712
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

21:34.860 --> 21:35.884
Ticket?

21:35.961 --> 21:36.950
That was very kind of you.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.399
You're very decent.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.938
Thank you.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.611
You're real.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.040
Ticket?

21:56.415 --> 21:58.474
- How's everything today?
- It's good.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.018
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.

22:01.119 --> 22:04.646
I meant behavior on the train.

22:04.723 --> 22:07.351
Does anything, anybody
seem strange to you?

22:07.926 --> 22:09.052
You're a little strange.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.392
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?

22:16.268 --> 22:17.565
Are you drunk or something?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.265
Come here.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.301
Come here for a second.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.332
Come on.

22:33.452 --> 22:35.113
Think of it as a game.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.381
A game?

22:38.290 --> 22:39.314
Wow.

22:41.493 --> 22:43.859
They're all so utterly normal, Sean.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.829
That's what's so terrifying about them.

22:47.132 --> 22:49.362
Maybe there's a team at work.

22:50.235 --> 22:54.729
The sleeping giant in cahoots
with the minister and Denoff there.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.907
Don't forget the sullen college kid.
He's the expendable one.

22:57.976 --> 23:00.467
I bet they're all controlled
by the conductor.

23:02.247 --> 23:06.411
Standing there all dictatorial.
Demanding tickets.

23:06.485 --> 23:07.850
You're funny.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.513
Damn it.

23:09.588 --> 23:11.783
What about that guy?

23:12.124 --> 23:13.318
Deposition.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.451
What about the woman
who's sitting across from him?

23:15.527 --> 23:17.620
Hair appointment. Every Monday.
You know this.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.186
You talk to these people more than I do.

23:19.264 --> 23:21.164
Right, right. And the guy behind her,

23:21.233 --> 23:23.633
he's late for an audition, right?

23:25.704 --> 23:26.796
That or a court appearance.

23:26.872 --> 23:29.033
- That's the guy that was cited twice for DUI.
- For DUI. I know.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.007
- Hey, how's the signal in here?
- It's good.

23:31.309 --> 23:33.937
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

23:34.012 --> 23:36.572
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you
anymore, Sherlock?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.444
Uh-oh.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.785
Now we've slipped into
racial profiling land.

23:44.856 --> 23:47.188
Did anyone else come out
of that bathroom today?

23:47.359 --> 23:49.224
Well,
I saw you coming out of there.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.588
- Me?
- Yes.

23:50.662 --> 23:53.631
- No.
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

23:53.698 --> 23:54.824
Me?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.527
Hey, mister!

23:56.601 --> 23:57.761
- Hey.
- Hold on.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.736
Hold on a second. Just hold on a second.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.136
There's gotta be something in here.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.800
- You dropped this.
- Gotta be something in here.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.374
A broken phone? What is this?

24:07.679 --> 24:10.079
Glenbrook Station.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.210
Christina?

24:14.753 --> 24:15.913
Yeah.

24:16.588 --> 24:17.748
Excuse me.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.584
Glenbrook Station.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.328
Hey. Hey, come with me.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.228
- This isn't our stop.
- No, come on. Let's take a walk.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.267
- We don't get off here.
- I know. We'll just be spontaneous.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.392
You're kind of freaking me out.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.006
I know this is gonna sound really weird,

24:40.078 --> 24:41.978
but I have a really bad feeling
about this train,

24:42.047 --> 24:44.447
and I think that we should get off. Okay?

24:45.550 --> 24:49.748
- Just get your stuff.
- All aboard. Doors are closing.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.925
Come on. Come with me.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.493
So, what now?

25:02.567 --> 25:05.229
Wait for me, right here.
I'll be right back.

25:08.740 --> 25:13.040
- Your attention, please.
- Train 7140 to Skokie

25:13.111 --> 25:16.842
will be leaving in 15
minutes from track two.

25:42.307 --> 25:47.768
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in...

26:35.493 --> 26:36.585
Hey.

26:38.697 --> 26:40.358
You ready to get that coffee now?

26:41.333 --> 26:44.962
Sorry, yeah. Just one more second, okay?

26:56.047 --> 26:57.844
Oh, for God's sake.

27:00.518 --> 27:01.507
Feeling sick?

27:03.388 --> 27:06.323
It's motion sickness.
I get it all the time.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.628
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.535
- Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?

27:20.338 --> 27:21.430
No. I don't have one.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.201
Sure?

27:23.274 --> 27:24.536
Yeah, I'm sure.

27:24.609 --> 27:27.737
Look, why don't you leave me alone, please.
Or I'll call the police.

27:27.879 --> 27:30.404
With what?
I thought you said you didn't have a phone.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.879
You know, you have no right.

27:38.089 --> 27:40.250
What are you doing? Give me my bag back!

27:42.827 --> 27:44.488
Are you crazy?

27:47.298 --> 27:48.822
- Where are they?
- Sean?

27:48.900 --> 27:49.889
Get back!

27:49.968 --> 27:51.299
Sean, what are you doing?

27:53.538 --> 27:55.165
Sean, what's going on?

27:58.677 --> 27:59.939
- Sean!
- Where is the phone?

28:00.545 --> 28:02.137
Sean! Sean!

28:07.786 --> 28:08.775
It wasn't you.

28:10.822 --> 28:11.948
What the hell's wrong with you?

28:12.023 --> 28:13.149
- No!
- Are you insane?

28:13.224 --> 28:15.454
No! No! No!

28:15.794 --> 28:17.284
- Where is the phone?
- Stop it!

28:17.362 --> 28:18.522
- Get away from me!
- Where is it?

28:18.596 --> 28:20.029
Get away from me, please!

28:23.334 --> 28:25.302
Sean. Sean! Get up! Sean?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.668
- Shit.
- Sean, listen to me! Get up!

28:28.339 --> 28:30.830
- Sean! Sean!
- Give me your hand! Get off the track!

28:31.009 --> 28:33.409
- Mister, come on!
- Sean, Sean, get up!

28:33.712 --> 28:35.270
Sean! Sean!

28:46.024 --> 28:47.855
Cold.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.461
Goodwin?

28:57.235 --> 28:58.930
Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?

29:05.310 --> 29:08.905
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Do you copy? Please respond.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.045
It's freezing in here. What's going on?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.018
What was that?

29:26.331 --> 29:27.320
He's in trouble.

29:29.334 --> 29:30.858
I think the oxygen just went out.

29:35.807 --> 29:36.796
Goodwin?

29:40.912 --> 29:41.901
Goodwin!

29:46.885 --> 29:48.011
Find a way to get through to him.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.797
What is it?

30:13.444 --> 30:14.604
What's going on?

30:19.984 --> 30:22.248
It's not the tertiary cooling, either.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.593
Just keep sending strings out.
See if he hooks onto something.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.101
It's hard to say exactly
what he's going through.

30:51.716 --> 30:53.946
- Sir?
- Please!

30:54.586 --> 30:56.144
There's not a whole lot
we can do from here.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.126
If nothing changes,
how much time does he have?

31:06.231 --> 31:08.631
Some.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.258
But not a lot.

31:39.797 --> 31:42.391
There are four principal
dialects of Arabic.

31:42.467 --> 31:46.801
Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese
and North African.

31:46.871 --> 31:50.432
We will now play you portions of each,
discussing their differences.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.691
Lilly awoke
in an evening dress and opera cloak.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.886
In her hand were five playing cards.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.657
They were the queen of spades,
the four of clubs...

32:23.007 --> 32:23.996
Goodwin, you out there?

32:28.413 --> 32:30.210
Goodwin? Where's Goodwin?

32:30.348 --> 32:33.044
This is Captain Stevens. Do you copy?

32:33.117 --> 32:35.415
Captain Stevens?

32:35.486 --> 32:36.953
The capsule lost power.

32:38.089 --> 32:39.215
The capsule?

32:39.290 --> 32:42.851
Is that where you are right now, Captain?
In a capsule?

32:43.328 --> 32:44.590
You should know. Who are you?

32:45.163 --> 32:46.892
Let me get Captain Goodwin. Get Goodwin.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.362
You invented this thing, right?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.428
- I did.
- Wait. Are you in command here?

32:51.769 --> 32:55.227
I am. Were you able to locate the
information we need, Captain?

32:55.707 --> 32:57.334
That's a negative, sir.

32:57.408 --> 33:01.674
I was unable to find the bomber,
but I did save a passenger on the train.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.236
I got her off safely. A woman.

33:03.314 --> 33:07.250
Captain? It's gonna be counterproductive for
you to try to save anyone on that train.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.546
They are outside the mission.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.183
But she survived.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.517
And maybe the rest could, too.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.716
She survived,
but only inside the source code.

33:14.792 --> 33:15.816
None of them can be saved.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.588
What is the source code?

33:17.662 --> 33:20.460
It's quantum mechanics. Parabolic calculus.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.364
- It's very complicated.
- Try me.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.630
Fine.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.568
When a light bulb is turned off,
there's an after-glow,

33:30.641 --> 33:32.768
a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?

33:33.444 --> 33:34.968
- Yes.
- Of course.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.916
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged,

33:38.983 --> 33:42.111
just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.

33:42.987 --> 33:45.251
Now, there's another peculiarity
about the brain.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.018
It contains a short-term memory track

33:47.091 --> 33:48.752
that's approximately eight minutes long.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.257
Like a convenience store security camera

33:51.329 --> 33:54.696
that only records the last portion
of the day's activity on its hard drive.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.563
Now, in combining these two phenomena,

33:57.969 --> 34:00.199
circuitry that remains viable post-mortem

34:00.271 --> 34:02.762
and a memory bank
that goes back eight minutes,

34:02.840 --> 34:06.173
source code enables us to capitalize
on the overlap.

34:06.911 --> 34:09.141
Sean Fentress died on that train.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.440
Of all the passengers aboard,

34:10.514 --> 34:13.973
he was your best link.
You two share compatibility

34:14.052 --> 34:17.886
in terms of gender, body-size,
and your synaptic maps.

34:17.989 --> 34:19.650
What happens after the eight minutes?

34:20.024 --> 34:24.085
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.

34:24.594 --> 34:29.123
You cannot exist inside the source code
beyond Fentress's eight minutes.

34:30.835 --> 34:34.771
Source code is not time travel.

34:34.839 --> 34:38.467
Rather, source code is time reassignment.

34:39.043 --> 34:42.478
It gives us access to a parallel reality.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.879
Now, the deaths on that
train were a tragedy,

34:44.949 --> 34:46.348
but source code empowers us...

34:46.417 --> 34:49.614
No, but I saved one person.

34:49.687 --> 34:52.246
That girl that's always sitting
across from me.

34:52.322 --> 34:55.053
I pulled her off the train.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.889
Give me her name.

34:58.162 --> 35:01.620
Christina. I don't remember her last name.

35:08.473 --> 35:09.497
Her name was Christina Warren.

35:10.975 --> 35:12.704
- Yes.
- She was 28.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.075
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.306
Died this morning on the train.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.111
No, no. I pulled her off. She's fine.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.209
No, she isn't.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.715
Believe me. She is.

35:24.155 --> 35:25.144
Believe me!

35:25.223 --> 35:27.487
She saw me get hit by the express train.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.456
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.

35:29.527 --> 35:33.657
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.

35:33.731 --> 35:34.755
What second attack?

35:35.333 --> 35:37.927
The train was just the beginning,
a letter of intent.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.501
What aren't you telling me here?

35:42.306 --> 35:45.366
We have information
that downtown Chicago is the next target,

35:45.443 --> 35:47.638
and they're planning to detonate
a dirty bomb.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.109
Do you have any idea
how many people would die

35:50.181 --> 35:52.706
if an explosion of that magnitude
were to occur in the city?

35:53.017 --> 35:54.177
We're evacuating as we speak.

35:54.752 --> 35:56.845
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?

35:56.921 --> 35:59.651
If you find the bomber,
his second attack,

35:59.724 --> 36:02.249
the real attack, we think,
can be prevented.

36:02.727 --> 36:06.060
We have very little time left. Out here,
the clocks only move in one direction.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.431
Charge the drivers.

36:08.533 --> 36:11.400
On the upper deck of the next carriage,
there's a conductor's compartment.

36:11.736 --> 36:13.761
It's a small office containing a strongbox.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.136
Inside is a loaded handgun.

36:16.207 --> 36:19.404
Get to it. You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.305
I took your advice.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.685
It was very good advice.

36:34.525 --> 36:35.958
You're still here.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.086
Of course I am.

36:38.162 --> 36:39.151
Guess what?

36:39.363 --> 36:41.490
You quit your job
and you enrolled in an LSAT course.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.357
Good guess.

36:43.534 --> 36:44.558
Soda can.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.193
Coffee spill.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.072
Listen to me.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.036
Don't answer this.

36:52.443 --> 36:53.603
You deserve better than that guy.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.909
Everything looks more beautiful
in retrospect, doesn't it?

36:57.348 --> 36:58.747
- Ticket?
- How did you know that was...

36:59.450 --> 37:01.611
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.313
- How well do you know me?
- Hey, Grandpa...

37:03.387 --> 37:04.649
Not that well, apparently.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.587
Do you know me well enough
that if I did something that looked

37:06.657 --> 37:08.420
a little strange
and was maybe even a little bit dangerous,

37:08.492 --> 37:10.551
but I told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?

37:12.096 --> 37:13.290
No.

37:15.666 --> 37:16.928
Wow. That was honest.

37:19.337 --> 37:21.635
You're beautiful. You're kind.

37:22.573 --> 37:23.801
And you're painfully honest.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.733
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?

37:26.811 --> 37:28.244
It's the new me.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.727
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

37:55.873 --> 37:58.239
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.913
Ticket?

38:26.404 --> 38:28.599
Glenbrook Station.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.053
All right, I don't wanna hurt you.

38:51.462 --> 38:54.659
No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat,
all right? He's bleeding.

38:54.732 --> 38:56.131
He needs medical attention.

38:56.667 --> 39:00.501
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun
out of the train's security box?

39:00.571 --> 39:02.095
Careful, ma'am.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.774
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?

39:06.377 --> 39:08.572
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No! You need to go to the hospital, Sean.

39:08.646 --> 39:11.615
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?

39:17.288 --> 39:19.188
What would you do
if you only had a minute left to live?

39:19.623 --> 39:22.251
I don't know.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.958
I would call my dad.

39:27.431 --> 39:29.331
I would hear his voice,

39:31.535 --> 39:33.196
and I'd tell him I was sorry.

39:41.278 --> 39:43.508
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.

39:44.849 --> 39:47.147
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:00.531 --> 40:03.694
Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox, that
was a really great idea. Thanks for that.

40:04.635 --> 40:05.693
Did you make any progress?

40:06.036 --> 40:07.560
Can I get access to a phone?

40:07.772 --> 40:09.706
I need to talk to my father.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.770
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.

40:19.717 --> 40:20.741
Goodwin, how am I doing?

40:21.919 --> 40:23.580
I'm just trying
to measure my performance here.

40:23.654 --> 40:26.521
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?

40:27.091 --> 40:30.254
We are wasting valuable time here.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.432
No, no.

40:41.505 --> 40:44.633
I have never been on the other side
of a source code mission.

40:44.708 --> 40:47.643
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?

40:47.711 --> 40:49.269
CAOC-N. What is that?

40:49.346 --> 40:52.747
Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.

40:53.517 --> 40:54.916
What are they?

40:54.985 --> 40:58.079
Captain, you should have found a suspect
by now.

40:58.456 --> 41:02.256
This tactical advantage,
this tremendous tool that we've given you,

41:02.359 --> 41:05.021
don't squander it thinking. Do.

41:05.429 --> 41:07.294
Please contact my father for me.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.435
This will stop at some point, Captain.

41:12.336 --> 41:14.827
As soon as you finish the mission.

41:16.006 --> 41:18.236
And you're doing really great.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.366
And this will end.

41:21.846 --> 41:25.373
Now, whoever planted the bomb
had to have equipment of some kind.

41:25.449 --> 41:28.748
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get
into the overhead vent,

41:28.819 --> 41:29.808
flashlight, something.

41:30.721 --> 41:33.815
Check bags and backpacks,
briefcases, anything.

41:37.061 --> 41:39.029
So, I took your advice.

41:39.396 --> 41:41.387
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...

41:56.814 --> 42:00.944
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.952
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.

42:03.420 --> 42:04.819
Were you in the military?

42:06.423 --> 42:08.948
A friend of mine was.

42:09.026 --> 42:13.690
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared,
and no one's heard from him since.

42:18.035 --> 42:19.502
Do you have the Internet on your phone?

42:20.104 --> 42:21.128
No.

42:21.572 --> 42:25.099
It's just connected to the office
by a really long piece of string.

42:27.611 --> 42:29.806
Do you think you can see
what you could find on this guy?

42:29.880 --> 42:32.110
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.

42:32.182 --> 42:34.844
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.743
Okay. You owe me.

42:37.087 --> 42:38.452
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

42:38.522 --> 42:40.854
Why don't I get one for you now?

42:40.925 --> 42:42.392
Okay. Christina?

42:44.194 --> 42:45.183
Um...

42:45.763 --> 42:48.357
I've been having these dreams lately.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.267
Really vivid.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.226
And you've been in them.

42:55.306 --> 42:56.330
Really?

42:56.407 --> 43:00.002
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...

43:00.077 --> 43:01.567
It's just...

43:24.001 --> 43:25.366
Um...

43:26.036 --> 43:29.130
I'll call you back in a
minute, all right? Yeah.

43:29.773 --> 43:32.003
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.

43:32.543 --> 43:33.669
For what?

43:34.612 --> 43:39.208
Psych. And I got a big test this morning,
so I should get back to it.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.410
Can I borrow a pen?

43:44.822 --> 43:46.221
Yeah, sure.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.326
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!

43:52.062 --> 43:54.155
Hey, your bag is a mess.

43:54.665 --> 43:56.098
What are you doing, man?

43:56.166 --> 43:59.829
Never find what I'm looking for.
It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.

43:59.903 --> 44:01.200
How about you let the guy
have his bag back?

44:01.271 --> 44:02.568
Finish your deal.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.574
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.

44:06.043 --> 44:07.408
This guy.

44:07.911 --> 44:09.538
Don't do that.

44:09.613 --> 44:11.877
Nothing. What am I doing?

44:14.284 --> 44:15.945
Jesus.

44:16.654 --> 44:17.643
Dick.

44:17.721 --> 44:18.779
CAOC-N.

44:18.856 --> 44:22.724
- Can you believe that?
- Asshole.

44:32.069 --> 44:33.798
Excuse me, ma'am?

44:33.871 --> 44:35.338
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.

44:35.406 --> 44:38.432
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.

44:39.376 --> 44:41.776
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?

44:41.845 --> 44:43.244
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering...

44:43.313 --> 44:45.508
Then what was going on down there?

44:49.153 --> 44:50.848
Oh, you know, uh...

44:50.921 --> 44:54.254
We were just having a little bit
of an argument, actually, about this patch.

44:54.324 --> 44:56.315
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?

44:56.393 --> 44:59.556
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these letters,
they look familiar to you?

44:59.630 --> 45:00.722
Do you know what the "N" stands for?

45:02.266 --> 45:05.099
It's Air Force, and the
"N" stands for Nellis.

45:05.169 --> 45:07.467
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.733
Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?

45:10.140 --> 45:11.732
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.

45:11.809 --> 45:15.905
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.

45:15.979 --> 45:18.880
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money. Just bring it back.

45:18.949 --> 45:21.144
All right. Thank you so much.

45:28.459 --> 45:31.428
This is a Chicago-bound train.

45:32.129 --> 45:34.290
Next stop, Chicago,

45:34.798 --> 45:36.732
Union Station.

45:37.334 --> 45:39.063
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

45:47.411 --> 45:48.400
Post Operator.

45:50.981 --> 45:54.041
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.

45:54.718 --> 45:56.083
Name, please?

45:56.153 --> 45:58.246
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.

45:58.322 --> 46:01.223
- Hold the line.
- All aboard.

46:01.291 --> 46:02.622
Doors are closing.

46:02.693 --> 46:05.218
Dr. Rutledge
will be on in a moment.

46:07.798 --> 46:10.164
I have to tell you something.

46:10.234 --> 46:11.929
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?

46:12.002 --> 46:16.234
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base. Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...

46:17.207 --> 46:18.401
He's dead, Sean.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.202
What?

46:22.513 --> 46:25.744
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed
in action two months ago.

46:26.383 --> 46:28.248
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.

46:28.318 --> 46:30.843
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.

46:30.921 --> 46:32.388
It was on the first site I tried.

46:35.259 --> 46:37.420
His father's name is Donald, right?

46:38.829 --> 46:40.660
This is from last week.

46:40.731 --> 46:43.495
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss

46:43.567 --> 46:46.798
"the death of his son,
Army Captain Colter Stevens,

46:46.870 --> 46:49.031
"who died in Afghanistan in February,

46:49.106 --> 46:52.098
"and was honored posthumously
with a silver star.

46:52.543 --> 46:56.035
"Also on the broadcast
will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez,

46:56.113 --> 46:57.978
"whose life was saved by Captain Stevens

46:58.048 --> 47:00.778
"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."

47:03.954 --> 47:04.943
I'm sorry.

47:06.456 --> 47:07.514
Captain?

47:10.227 --> 47:12.593
Sean? Talk to me.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.563
Captain?

47:15.599 --> 47:18.534
Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.

47:18.602 --> 47:21.537
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.

47:24.942 --> 47:25.931
Hey, this guy's crashing!

47:28.912 --> 47:32.473
- Captain, just tell me what you see.
- Just look and speak.

47:32.549 --> 47:34.312
I see a card.

47:35.519 --> 47:37.578
That's good.

47:37.788 --> 47:40.450
- Do you copy?
- We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.

47:40.524 --> 47:41.616
That's very good.

47:53.103 --> 47:54.161
Am I dead?

48:01.111 --> 48:04.205
A radio listing is saying that I died
in a helicopter crash, in country,

48:04.281 --> 48:05.407
and my father received a medal for me.

48:05.482 --> 48:07.074
Your condition's not the issue here.

48:07.517 --> 48:09.849
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attack.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.478
Everything else is irrelevant.

48:12.155 --> 48:14.715
A news report saying that I'm dead
is irrelevant?

48:15.025 --> 48:19.485
Until the person or persons
who blew up that train are in custody, yes.

48:21.265 --> 48:22.493
Goodwin,

48:24.701 --> 48:27.329
one soldier to another, am I dead?

48:38.215 --> 48:41.150
Part of your brain remains activated.

48:43.453 --> 48:45.512
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.

48:45.589 --> 48:46.715
They still move.

48:47.457 --> 48:48.947
They are a manifestation.

48:49.026 --> 48:51.392
They're just your way of making sense
of all this.

48:52.262 --> 48:56.221
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?

48:57.467 --> 49:01.563
I'm imagining that I'm still alive,
that I'm in this capsule?

49:06.310 --> 49:08.710
We have core temp dropping.

49:38.942 --> 49:39.966
Captain, what just happened?

49:46.783 --> 49:47.875
I asked you a question.

49:50.087 --> 49:53.454
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

49:54.524 --> 49:55.582
Where am I?

49:56.426 --> 49:57.415
That's classified.

49:58.695 --> 49:59.821
Fuck you!

50:03.700 --> 50:07.636
Captain, I cannot imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

50:08.238 --> 50:11.799
But if we're to prevent a second attack,
we need to send you back immediately.

50:11.875 --> 50:15.311
And, Captain,
you cannot deviate from the mission

50:15.379 --> 50:16.607
while inside the source code,

50:16.680 --> 50:18.045
even to investigate your...

50:19.516 --> 50:21.450
Even to investigate what happened to you.

50:21.718 --> 50:25.245
There's only one continuum on this end
and it can't be unsettled.

50:25.555 --> 50:29.184
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.

50:30.360 --> 50:33.193
Just before the explosion,
so at 7:46 this morning,

50:33.263 --> 50:36.824
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train,

50:36.900 --> 50:40.700
but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.

50:40.771 --> 50:42.238
If the call even went through,

50:42.305 --> 50:45.399
it would be received
by a different me entirely.

50:46.476 --> 50:51.607
This may be difficult for you to hear,
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?

50:51.681 --> 50:54.775
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.

50:54.851 --> 50:58.343
And that represents the entirety
of your function here.

50:58.422 --> 51:00.083
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!

51:00.323 --> 51:01.847
I'll see if that makes an impression!

51:01.925 --> 51:06.555
You cannot alter the continuum of this
reality from within the source code.

51:07.164 --> 51:08.426
This can't be legal, what you're doing.

51:08.498 --> 51:12.025
In fact, your acquisition by this program
as well as the program itself

51:12.102 --> 51:14.764
has been reviewed and sanctioned
by military court.

51:18.008 --> 51:21.637
Many soldiers would find this
preferable to death.

51:21.711 --> 51:25.169
The opportunity to continue
serving their country.

51:27.017 --> 51:30.578
Have you spent much time
in battle, sir? Huh?

51:31.021 --> 51:32.716
That's immaterial.

51:33.990 --> 51:37.050
Any soldier I've ever served with would say
that one death is service enough.

51:37.594 --> 51:41.428
Fine. You can have that in return
for completing this mission.

51:42.499 --> 51:44.729
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.

51:45.135 --> 51:47.763
Terminate your service. Let you die.

51:51.141 --> 51:52.130
This is taking too long.

51:52.509 --> 51:54.670
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.

51:57.814 --> 52:00.476
I am certain we can find other servicemen

52:00.550 --> 52:02.780
with wounds similar to yours
who would consider

52:02.853 --> 52:05.117
being a part of this program an honor.

52:05.288 --> 52:08.280
What? No, wait, what?

52:08.992 --> 52:10.482
Send him back.

52:11.495 --> 52:12.587
Charge the drivers.

52:17.901 --> 52:20.631
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember

52:20.704 --> 52:23.571
that it's not only about you,
but it's also about

52:23.640 --> 52:27.269
two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,

52:28.044 --> 52:30.239
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.

52:31.381 --> 52:32.370
Your advice.

52:33.216 --> 52:34.205
Hey, Grandpa.

52:45.529 --> 52:48.327
Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?

52:49.633 --> 52:52.568
There are hundreds of people on that train.

52:53.403 --> 52:55.496
Well, then check them out one by one.

52:56.339 --> 52:59.001
It doesn't matter what you do to them.
They're already dead.

52:59.075 --> 53:01.236
Get to that gun,
and shoot someone if you have to.

53:01.311 --> 53:03.074
But get us some usable intel.

53:03.813 --> 53:04.871
No, wait!

53:17.961 --> 53:20.259
We have to keep doing this
until you find the bomber.

53:20.330 --> 53:22.457
Please. I'm trying. I'm trying.

53:22.799 --> 53:23.823
Who is the bomber?

53:26.169 --> 53:27.193
I'm trying.

53:29.806 --> 53:34.072
I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're
exhausted, and we're all frustrated,

53:34.144 --> 53:36.510
but we cannot fail. You can do this.

53:36.646 --> 53:39.080
I can't. I can't.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.683
Yes, you can.

53:41.251 --> 53:42.878
You're a born hero, son.

53:43.386 --> 53:44.876
Even your father thinks so.

53:46.122 --> 53:47.885
Saving people is what you do best.

53:50.527 --> 53:51.721
It was about his third tour.

53:52.862 --> 53:54.659
- I didn't want him to go back.
- Dad?

53:54.731 --> 53:57.393
I just started feeling like
he didn't want to come home anymore.

53:57.467 --> 53:59.731
- Dad?
- Like somehow, he couldn't come home.

54:00.604 --> 54:03.402
And he wouldn't talk to me,
wouldn't hear me.

54:04.441 --> 54:07.877
Finally he said he just couldn't leave
his unit out there without him,

54:07.944 --> 54:09.275
and that was that.

54:11.147 --> 54:13.240
Those guys were his family.

54:15.185 --> 54:18.018
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I don't know,

54:19.789 --> 54:22.849
I never fully understood him.

54:22.926 --> 54:24.188
And I can't believe he's gone.

54:29.899 --> 54:30.991
Send me back in.

55:03.700 --> 55:05.930
Please don't blow me up again.

55:35.899 --> 55:37.366
Hello?

55:37.434 --> 55:39.026
I know it's you.

55:39.169 --> 55:42.229
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

55:42.305 --> 55:44.637
I'm gonna find you. Turn around.

55:47.811 --> 55:49.802
- Hey, there.
- Me?

55:50.580 --> 55:51.945
Why do you look so surprised?

55:56.686 --> 55:57.846
Don't.

56:00.523 --> 56:02.855
Move. I said move. Move.
Put your bag over there.

56:02.926 --> 56:03.950
- Okay.
- Move over.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.494
- Put the bag over there and move over.
- Okay, okay.

56:05.562 --> 56:08.725
Move over. Move over.
Now hand me your phone.

56:09.966 --> 56:11.934
- You're done. You're done.
- What?

56:12.235 --> 56:13.532
You can't kill anybody anymore.

56:13.770 --> 56:15.101
What? I don't understand.

56:15.171 --> 56:16.729
You were going to trigger the bomb
with your phone.

56:16.806 --> 56:21.175
What? Dude, I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

56:21.911 --> 56:26.371
Listen, my name's George Troxel.
I'm a software engineer, okay?

56:26.449 --> 56:28.144
- Right.
- I was talking to my wife.

56:29.819 --> 56:31.286
Try it again.

56:32.055 --> 56:34.182
Your call. Dial it again.

56:35.525 --> 56:37.857
Okay. I'm gonna press redial.

56:38.495 --> 56:41.396
Your phone is gonna ring,
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

56:45.168 --> 56:47.966
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

56:52.108 --> 56:53.132
Hey!

56:53.543 --> 56:55.204
You dropped this.

56:55.812 --> 56:57.302
Wow. Thanks.

57:04.254 --> 57:05.346
Hey!

57:28.211 --> 57:31.078
All aboard. Doors are closing.

57:33.049 --> 57:34.846
Shit! No! No!

57:36.719 --> 57:37.845
No!

57:39.589 --> 57:40.886
Wait!

57:43.927 --> 57:45.554
No! Come on!

58:00.043 --> 58:01.237
Stop the train!

58:25.602 --> 58:26.694
Hey!

58:30.240 --> 58:31.366
Hey!

58:41.017 --> 58:42.712
- Derek Frost.
- Yes?

58:43.486 --> 58:45.147
- See this?
- Yes.

58:45.221 --> 58:47.382
- You recognize it?
- No.

58:50.326 --> 58:51.657
Jesus.

58:53.963 --> 58:55.658
How about you give me your wallet?

58:56.366 --> 58:57.526
Okay.

59:00.436 --> 59:02.336
You left it on the train deliberately.

59:03.206 --> 59:06.175
I must have dropped it.

59:06.543 --> 59:07.703
No.

59:08.278 --> 59:11.111
You planted it there,
so everybody would think you were dead.

59:15.985 --> 59:17.213
I know it's you.

59:18.721 --> 59:20.382
How do you know so much?

59:27.096 --> 59:29.291
What the hell is that thing?

59:30.500 --> 59:32.832
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!

59:34.871 --> 59:36.702
Do you wanna see it?

59:37.407 --> 59:38.601
Very patriotic.

59:39.809 --> 59:41.037
Slowly, slowly!

59:47.483 --> 59:49.678
All right, all right!
Back up! Back up! Back up!

59:57.327 --> 01:00:00.819
Not many people could build that.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.337
All right. Where is your next target?

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:11.662
Sean?

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:16.677
Oh, my God!

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.603
Sean Fentress?

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:52.775
Teacher.

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:54.944
History.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.148
I don't know you.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:02.450
I think I killed your girlfriend.

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:05.120
Why?

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:07.787
You messed up my timing.

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:10.327
- Why?
- Oh.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:13.097
You mean "Why this?"

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:19.735
Because the world is hell.

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:23.677
But we have a chance to start over
in the rubble.

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.210
But first there has to be rubble.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.078
You're a teacher, you understand.

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.647
Christina.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.384
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.954
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.302
This isn't the end.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:26.137
Check through there.
I'll go check this way.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.449
- Okay.
- This is Beleaguered Castle.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:24.897
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:36.502
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.945
I have your bomber. I have his name.

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.948
You have the bomber's name?

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.111
Derek Frost.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:56.428
He got into a rented white van
in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:04:00.765
Illinois plates, five, Charlie,
Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven.

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:04.004
Illinois plates, 5CGY847.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.240
All right, let's move.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:10.168
And Goodwin, there is
a radioactive device in the van.

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:11.907
Some kind of bomb.

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.037
Thank you, Captain.

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.207
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.884
Thank you, Captain.
You are now off the clock.

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.182
About our deal?

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:24.659
I had hoped that you might reconsider that,
for the sake of the program.

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:27.091
I have. I want something else now.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.024
Good.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.664
I still wanna die.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.662
But I want to go back in

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.830
and I wanna save all those people
on that train first.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:39.170
It doesn't work that way. It can't.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:40.834
No, I know. I know, I know.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:45.439
I'm not really asking you to
believe me, sir. I'm just...

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:48.711
I'm asking you
to have the decency to let me try.

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.951
CPD-2, this is AU SWAT-1.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:57.453
Van is approaching fence gate
to the quarry. Over.

01:04:57.526 --> 01:05:00.723
- Roger that, AU SWAT-1.
- Allow the vehicle to enter the quarry road.

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:03.526
We'll stop him about halfway down. Over.

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:08.731
AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2.
Block the east end of the road. Over.

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.601
AU SWAT-2, roger that.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.502
We're going to switch now to a live
feed from our Chicago affiliate.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.273
The SWAT team
is approaching the white van.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.712
The Illinois man has been sought
since early this morning.

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:22.613
The door is open
and the man is on the ground.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.084
It appears he has surrendered.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.419
Earlier today,
the police discovered...

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.822
Congratulations, Captain.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:33.988
In recent months, Frost started posting
anti-government statements on his website.

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.197
Yes, sir, it's a real validation
of the program.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:40.963
A clear window into
just how revolutionary source code can be.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:44.564
We finally have a powerful weapon now
in the war on terror.

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:48.004
Congratulations, Captain. A job well done.

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:52.407
He's not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.841
I'm still waiting on an answer.

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:01.751
Are you married, Captain?

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.350
Um...

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.854
Joe?

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:07.593
Why don't you go take a break?

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:10.257
- You deserve to celebrate.
- Sure.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.493
Can I get you something?

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.326
No, I'm fine.

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:19.101
Why? Are you asking me on a date?

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:20.665
Sorry. Poor taste.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.938
- Are you married?
- Hmm?

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:24.837
No.

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.171
I am divorced.

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:31.882
Do you think
there's an alternate version of you?

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.250
A Goodwin who made different choices?

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:37.085
What do you mean?

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:41.094
Like, a you who didn't get married
and get divorced.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.393
Or just married someone else.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.694
A woman who took
a different fork in the road.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:51.804
No, I don't, Captain.

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.633
What you experienced was a shadow.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:59.004
It was an afterimage of
a victim on a train.

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.440
This is real life. Here.

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.850
The one where you're talking to
a dead helicopter pilot?

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.926
The program wasn't designed
to alter the past.

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:17.588
It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.861
I missed something, Captain.

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:22.198
That train shouldn't have blown up.

01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:23.761
There must have been a second detonator,

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:25.363
something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.877
It's a computer program, Captain.

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:34.074
The girl on the train, all the others,
they're lost.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:36.617
I'm sorry about that.

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.016
I get it. I get it.

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:41.479
I know.
Quantum physics, parabolic calculus.

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.058
You're wrong, Goodwin.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.025
You're just plain wrong.

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:47.953
Captain, Christina is dead.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:51.763
She doesn't have to be, ma'am.

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:55.396
Okay. I'll ask Rutledge.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.330
I'm asking you,

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.673
I'm asking you. Just...

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:04.301
Send me...

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.531
Captain.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.799
It's your choice.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:10.171
At the end of this source code,
I will terminate your life support.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.482
There will be no coming back.

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.515
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:28.819
It was an honor, Captain.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.434
And I thank you for your service.

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:36.301
Good luck.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:53.481
I took your advice.

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.823
You're gonna move to India,
and become a guru.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.689
Careful, ma'am.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:02.856
Yeah, I'm gonna go
find myself in the mountains.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.800
Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee
with me before you go.

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:11.606
Yeah. I'd like to do that.
Put it to the test.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.434
Good.

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.803
Let's do it today.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:19.939
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:26.151
- You know what?
- What?

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.752
I feel really good.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.650
Why?

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:35.853
Because I've been waiting for weeks
for you to ask me for coffee.

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:43.265
Ticket?

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.434
Okay.

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:50.140
Just give me a couple minutes, okay?
And I'll be right back.

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:52.237
Gotta go save the world.

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.352
I knew he was a keeper.

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:27.713
Excuse me!

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:35.889
Beautiful day.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.121
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.055
Ticket?

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.563
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.031
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.795
- You trust the DOD?
- They've got the finances.

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:51.237
Yeah, well, sure.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:54.572
Look, if we can get the funding,
I guarantee we can have at least...

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:59.975
Eight source code projects up and running
by the end of the year.

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.574
- Really? That many?
- Maybe more.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.118
You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge.

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.951
Well, thank you.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.689
We did save lives today.

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.725
Yes, a true victory for the program.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.317
A great victory for us all.

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:14.021
We'll talk soon.

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.694
So? Exciting times.

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:21.867
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1,

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:23.669
start crunching the data.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:25.635
Sir,

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:29.743
we told Captain Stevens

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:31.279
that we were gonna let him die.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.838
Let him die?

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:36.615
He just saved millions of lives today.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.915
How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:41.080
For all we know, he may be

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:44.319
the only candidate
with which the system works.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.488
So,

01:12:46.962 --> 01:12:48.930
let's clear his memory

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.121
and reinitialize source code.

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.065
Shall we?

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.471
Yes, sir.

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.346
Sorry, I just dropped...

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:09.077
Hey, Derek! This isn't your stop.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.641
Hey, mister!

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.881
You dropped this.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.857
Come on back here.

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:19.316
Oops.

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:51.219
Derek,

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:54.123
it's over.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.531
You understand?

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.170
Hey. My name is Derek Frost.

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.434
I planted a nuclear device in a white van

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:09.936
parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR
parking lot.

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.707
Right now I'm handcuffed to a pole

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:15.409
on the 944 CCR train
headed to Chicago Union Station.

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:18.747
I am a sick and pathetic human being.

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:22.487
And I need to be locked away
for a very long time.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:26.253
Okay.

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.497
Derek,

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.496
there's no more
burying the world in rubble today.

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:38.731
You mind if I borrow this?

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:45.678
Captain, some of the guys and I
are gonna go celebrate.

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:46.803
And...

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:51.216
Do you want me to initiate
the memory wipe, Captain?

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.275
Hello, Captain.

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:35.796
- Hello?
- Donald Stevens?

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:36.888
Yes?

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.434
My name is Sean Fentress.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.702
Who?

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.335
I served with your son, Colter.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.677
- Oh, boy.
- It's...

01:15:57.352 --> 01:16:00.446
I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to call you.

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:06.054
Sometimes it just takes a while to figure
out what you want to say. You know?

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:11.661
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I imagine it's not an easy call to make.

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:20.073
How are you doing, sir?

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.011
Well, all that came back was some ash.

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:29.843
It's hard to believe that it was him.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.186
How well did you know him?

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:48.364
I was there when he died, sir.

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:50.466
He said

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:56.742
that the last time
that you guys talked was tough,

01:16:58.647 --> 01:16:59.739
and

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.745
he wanted to say that he was sorry.

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:11.448
I just want him back.

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.016
I loved him so much.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.051
I wish you could have told him that.

01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:52.299
He knows it.

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:57.764
You take care, Mr. Stevens.

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.358
You okay?

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.360
Yeah.

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:32.998
Save the world?

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:34.964
Sort of.

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.942
So, where were we?

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.611
Getting some coffee.

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.108
Dr. Rutledge.

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:48.344
What?

01:18:58.567 --> 01:18:59.727
Shit.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:03.199
- What's so damn hard about it?
- I run a business, okay?

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.795
Everything moves on time
or people get fired.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.306
That's the way it works in the real world.

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:08.706
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, buddy?

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.836
Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll drown.

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:15.015
Thank you for that moment of Zen,
but nobody was talking to you.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:18.917
What, are you selling self-help CDs today?
Why don't you just mind your own business.

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:23.490
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here
this instant!

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.853
Why are you always so bitter, Max?

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:30.889
It's a bitter world we live in, my friend.
What do you want from me?

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.734
It doesn't have to be.

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:40.171
I will bet you $100 you can't make
all these people on this train laugh.

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.142
...Oh. Right.

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:49.977
Actually, you know what? 126 bucks.

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:52.710
Is that your way of making fun of me?

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.312
I guess you have a better gig. Never mind.

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:55.981
No, no. I'm good.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.725
Easiest money ever.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.318
- Come on.
- Excuse me, people.

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:06.028
One of our fellow passengers has decided to
offer me some money to...

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:09.628
What has gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:12.002
- It's the new me.
- I like it.

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:17.036
I am going to prosecute you
to the full extent of the law.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.270
Women always mess up my last name.

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.976
I was with a girl the other night
and she kept calling me "Getoff."

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:25.315
She was like, "Getoff! Getoff!"
I'm like, "No, Denoff, Denoff."

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:27.753
She says,
"No, you're fat and you're heavy. Get off!"

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.524
Good?

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.151
Twenty seconds.

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:34.695
Make it ten.

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:37.754
Goodwin?

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.637
Look at all this.

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:45.069
It's good to see you, ladies,
up this early in the morning.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.835
- What?
- Michelle. Barack.

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.805
All this life.

01:20:57.085 --> 01:21:00.521
Goodwin. Open this door.

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:12.963
- Put those headphones on.
- I wanna see them stretch.

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:15.525
- Why do you keep looking at your watch?
- Christina,

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:17.967
what would you do

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:21.239
if you knew you had
less than a minute to live?

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:30.046
I'd make those seconds count.

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.185
I'd kiss you again.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:35.322
Again? Mmm.

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:38.890
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.852
He's done enough, Doctor.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:45.251
And, I'm on the train...

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:07.044
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.927
It is a beautiful Monday
in Chicago today.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.158
Temperatures expected to
reach the lower 60s.

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:27.599
Right now 55 at the
lakefront, 54 at Midway,

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:28.863
53 at O'Hare.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.564
And now, up in the sky, we've got...

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.665
He earned that money.

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:35.903
- Yeah, he did.
- He was funny.

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:39.174
- Speaking of which, I have no cash.
- Great.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:42.546
Come here. I wanna show you something.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.877
- Such a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:47.046
It is a really perfect day.

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.128
Do you believe in fate?

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:04.962
Not really.
I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:07.703
- Come here.
- Wow.

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:26.756
So what do you wanna do today?

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:30.927
I think we should stay here for a while.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.893
This feels like exactly where
we're supposed to be, doesn't it?

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:43.870
Las Vegas' number one
morning news follows.

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:46.675
It's 72 degrees
on a cloudy Monday morning.

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:51.014
This is News Radio 840KX
in North Las Vegas.

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:53.418
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Captain.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:59.355
Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and an opera cloak.

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:03.221
In her hand were five playing cards.

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.526
At some point today,
you're gonna hear about

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:12.403
a failed terrorist attack
on a commuter train near Chicago.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.276
You and I kept that bomb from going off.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:19.770
An attempted bombing on a CCR train
outside Chicago.

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:23.882
But it was thwarted,
and the suspect was found on board,

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:27.453
- named Derek Frost.
- Derek Frost.

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:35.762
Captain Goodwin,
anything I can help you with?

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.435
No, that's fine. I'll come back later.

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.834
Keep an eye out.

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:52.610
One of these days the right crisis

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.773
is going to rear its head

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:59.213
and source code is going to
have its moment in the sun.

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:00.885
Yes, sir.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.229
If you're reading this e-mail,

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:14.530
then source code works even better
than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:17.503
You thought you were creating
eight minutes of a past event,

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:19.039
but you're not.

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:22.099
You've created a whole new world.

01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:27.240
Goodwin, if I'm right,
somewhere at the source code facility

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:31.081
you have a Captain Colter Stevens
waiting to send on a mission.

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:35.179
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:38.388
Tell him everything is gonna be okay.

01:26:39.305 --> 01:26:45.877
