THAT'S, LIKE, $1,800.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.835
LOOK, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN JIMMY GOT KICKED OUT

06:10.870 --> 06:12.132
OF SCHOOL IN THE FIFTH GRADE?

06:12.170 --> 06:13.239
FOR KILLING A TEACHER?

06:13.270 --> 06:14.407
FOR HITTING MISS LEPKY
WITH A SPITBALL.

SHE COULD'VE VERY WELL
HAVE BEEN KILLED.

06:19.090 --> 06:20.409
IT WAS ME
WHO RATTED HIM OUT, GUS.

06:20.460 --> 06:23.452
YOU DID THAT?

06:23.500 --> 06:24.455
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.365
YOU DON'T KNOW ALL MY SECRETS.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.537
I'M A MAN OF UNTOLD MYSTERIES.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.936
IF HE FOUND OUT,

06:29.970 --> 06:32.939
HE'D COME BACK AND GNAW OFF
ONE OF MY TOES.

06:32.980 --> 06:35.414
RATTING OUT JIMMY NICKLES?
THAT'S SUICIDAL.

06:35.450 --> 06:36.485
I THOUGHT I SAW HIM DO IT,

06:36.520 --> 06:37.487
AND I TOLD PRINCIPAL TROPP,

06:37.520 --> 06:39.420
BECAUSE HE SAID HE WASN'T GONNA
LET THE CLASS GO

06:39.460 --> 06:40.825
UNTIL SOMEBODY GAVE HIM A NAME.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.226
AND WHAT?
YOU JUST HAD TO GET HOME?

06:43.270 --> 06:46.137
DUDE, CHiPS WAS GONNA COME ON
IN, LIKE, 20 MINUTES.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.478
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

06:47.510 --> 06:49.341
IT WAS THE ONE
WITH THE FREEWAY CRASH.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.587
WHERE THE CAR USED THE EMPTY CAR
CARRIER TRAILER AS A RAMP

06:51.620 --> 06:53.144
AND FLIPPED IN MID-AIR.

06:53.190 --> 06:54.953
THAT HAPPENS
IN EVERY EPISODE, SHAWN.

06:54.990 --> 06:57.151
I WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

07:19.340 --> 07:22.503
A: I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WERE A KISS-ASS.

07:22.550 --> 07:24.438
AND B: WHO CARES?

07:24.480 --> 07:25.583
SO JIMMY GOT KICKED OUT.

07:25.620 --> 07:27.087
IT WAS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.350
I COULD FINALLY WEAR
UNDERWEAR TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.119
I DON'T KNOW, GUS.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.299
I ALWAYS SORT OF FELT
LIKE I GOT THE WRONG GUY.

07:33.330 --> 07:34.638
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE LOOK
ON JIMMY'S FACE

07:34.670 --> 07:37.036
WHEN THEY HAULED HIM
OUT OF CLASS THAT DAY.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.433
I DIDN'T DO IT!

07:38.480 --> 07:42.018
I PROMISE,
I DIDN'T DO IT!

07:42.050 --> 07:43.608
LOOK, AFTER JIMMY
GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL,

07:43.650 --> 07:46.118
THERE WERE ALL THESE STORIES
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.526
HE RAN AWAY FROM HOME,
HE GOT THROWN IN JUVENILE HALL,

07:48.570 --> 07:50.128
MOVED TO A SMALL TOWN
IN KANSAS

07:50.170 --> 07:51.706
WHERE THEY OUTLAWED
SINGING AND DANCING.

07:51.740 --> 07:53.571
THAT LAST ONE IS FOOTLOOSE.

07:53.610 --> 07:55.578
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.

07:55.610 --> 07:57.646
THE POINT IS, JIMMY'S LIFE
CHANGED THAT DAY,

07:57.680 --> 07:59.238
AND I FEEL LIKE I
GOTTA MAKE IT UP TO HIM.

07:59.290 --> 08:00.951
WHO KNOWS, GUS, I MIGHT'VE
STUNTED THE KID'S GROWTH.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.621
I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

08:02.660 --> 08:03.627
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE SAME DUDE

08:03.660 --> 08:05.594
WHO MADE AARON RENCHER
EAT HIS OWN RETAINER.

08:05.630 --> 08:07.234
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT THIS--

08:07.270 --> 08:08.339
WE TAKE THE CASE, RIGHT?

08:08.370 --> 08:10.577
WE PROVE, FOR ALL THE
AARON RENCHERS OF THE WORLD,

08:10.610 --> 08:13.044
WE ARE NO LONGER AFRAID
OF JIMMY NICKLES.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.712
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.115
BUT IF WE TAKE THIS CASE,

08:17.160 --> 08:19.526
WE'RE GONNA OVERCHARGE HIM
BY $1,800.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.699
DONE.

08:21.730 --> 08:23.664
[nickering]

08:23.700 --> 08:26.703
[imitating horse]

08:30.450 --> 08:32.589
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE OATS.

08:32.620 --> 08:34.110
OR THE ALFALFA PELLETS.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.354
THEY'RE TOO CHEWY FOR PELLETS.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.288
PELLETS SHOULD BE CRUNCHY.

08:36.330 --> 08:39.265
THEY SHOULD HAVE
A NATURAL CRUNCH TO THEM.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.029
[neighing]

08:43.610 --> 08:48.149
ALSO, THE DONKEY IN STABLE 11
IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.

08:48.180 --> 08:50.683
THIS IS IDIOTIC.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.359
LOOK, IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THE
CONNECTION TO TAKE HOLD, JIMMY.

08:53.390 --> 08:55.392
RUNNY D. AND I ARE JUST FEELING
EACH OTHER OUT HERE.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.863
WHATEVER.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.368
I GOTTA GO LOSE FIVE POUNDS
BEFORE THE NEXT RACE.

08:59.410 --> 09:02.277
YOU GOT HALF AN HOUR TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.414
[door slamming]

09:04.450 --> 09:06.179
WHAT DO YOU THINK, RUNNY D.?

09:06.220 --> 09:07.756
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HE'S THINKING.

09:07.790 --> 09:08.814
HE'S THINKING,

09:08.860 --> 09:09.986
"I HATE JIMMY.

09:10.030 --> 09:12.590
"HE PULLED MY SHORTS DOWN
IN FRONT OF JENNY SCARLATOS

09:12.630 --> 09:13.892
IN THE CAFETERIA."

09:13.940 --> 09:15.293
HMM?

09:15.340 --> 09:16.671
[flapping lips]

09:16.710 --> 09:17.472
ARE YOU CHANNELING THE HORSE?

09:17.510 --> 09:18.579
OR A LITTLE BOY
WITH A TIGHT FADE

09:18.610 --> 09:20.771
WHO USED TO WEAR HIS O.P.'s
WITHOUT A DRAWSTRING?

09:20.820 --> 09:22.742
THE HORSE, SHAWN.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.758
I DIDN'T HAVE A TIGHT FADE
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

09:24.790 --> 09:25.779
[wolf whistle]

09:25.830 --> 09:26.751
[whip smacks]

09:26.800 --> 09:27.824
HEY.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.192
(girl)
HOW ARE YOU?

09:34.380 --> 09:35.608
THAT'S INTERESTING.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.811
(Shawn)
THIS PLACE IS WEIRD
AND BORDERLINE DEPRESSING.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.282
I MEAN, WHO ARE
THESE PEOPLE?

09:43.730 --> 09:45.550
WELL, WELL, WELL.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.568
THIS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.431
WOW, DAD.

09:49.470 --> 09:50.698
TELL ME YOU'RE WEARING
THAT SHIRT

09:50.740 --> 09:52.947
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS
TO SPOT YOU FROM SPACE.

09:52.980 --> 09:53.947
VERY FUNNY, SHAWN.

09:53.980 --> 09:55.880
THIS HAPPENS TO BE ONE
OF MY LUCKY TRACK SHIRTS.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.478
I LIKE IT.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.659
I'D LIKE IT TOO, IF I HAD
TO WALK HOME IN THE DARK.

09:59.690 --> 10:00.850
(man)
HENRY.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.195
THIS YOUR KID?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.895
HEY, KID.

10:02.930 --> 10:03.999
PHIL "THE THRILL" SHERSHOW.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.701
SHAWN.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.002
THIS IS BURTON "OIL CAN" GUSTER.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.530
GOOD TO MEETCHA.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.810
HEY, HENRY TELL YA
FOR 20 YEARS,

10:10.850 --> 10:12.340
I BEEN HANDICAPPING HORSES?

10:12.390 --> 10:14.881
THAT SEEMS SO VERY CRUEL.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.321
HE MUSTA TOLD YA I HIT
THE PICK SIX IN '87?

10:18.360 --> 10:19.691
HEY PHIL, I THINK
IT'S PRETTY SAFE TO ASSUME,

10:19.730 --> 10:20.662
I HAVEN'T TOLD 'EM ANYTHING.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.009
FIVE MINUTES TO POST.
GOTTA MAKE IT BACK.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.739
HENRY TELL YA I LIKE
THE 2-3-4 TRIFECT A BOX?

10:27.780 --> 10:30.783
I THINK YOUR SHIRT
AND HIS SHIRT

10:30.820 --> 10:31.889
SHOULD GET TOGETHER
AND GO BOWLING.

10:31.930 --> 10:32.783
HA HA.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.024
YOU HAVE ALL KINDS
OF INTERESTING PALS

10:34.060 --> 10:34.822
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.066
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN, LOOK,
DON'T START.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.636
PHIL IS NOT A PAL.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.763
HE'S A BAD GAMBLER
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT.

10:39.810 --> 10:41.778
BUT HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
ON A HOT STREAK RIGHT NOW,

10:41.810 --> 10:42.902
WHICH IS WHY I LET HIM
TALK TO ME.

10:42.950 --> 10:43.917
NOT THAT I NEED IT.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.838
I HAVE WON 8 OF 11 RACES TODAY.

10:45.890 --> 10:47.414
ALL BY MYSELF.

10:47.460 --> 10:48.484
[whistles]

10:48.520 --> 10:50.351
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE ANYWAY?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.027
I TRIED TO DRAG YOU
OUT HERE FOR YEARS.

10:52.070 --> 10:54.334
I'M ONLY HERE TODAY
'CAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON A CASE.

10:54.370 --> 10:56.031
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE REASON
YOU NEVER CAME OUT HERE

10:56.070 --> 10:57.833
IS BECAUSE TO BE
A GOOD HANDICAPPER,

10:57.880 --> 10:59.848
YOU GOTTA PUT IN THE TIME,
YOU GOTTA DO THE RESEARCH,

10:59.880 --> 11:02.519
YOU GOTTA STUDY THE HORSES,
YOU GOTTA STUDY THE JOCKEYS.

11:02.550 --> 11:04.859
SOMETHING THAT TAKES PATIENCE
AND FOLLOW-THROUGH,

11:04.890 --> 11:06.426
WHICH YOU LACK.

11:06.460 --> 11:07.688
YES.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.766
THAT AND A SHIRT
FROM MR. FURLEY'S CLOSET.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.358
[bell rings]

11:11.400 --> 11:13.004
[male announcer over P.A.]
AND THE RACE IS ON.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.508
BABYFACED ASSASSIN
TAKES THE EARLY LEAD.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.373
BABYFACED ASSASSIN STRIDES
INTO THE FIRST...

11:18.420 --> 11:19.318
SO WHAT'S THE CASE?

11:19.350 --> 11:21.614
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A JIMMY NICKLES?

11:21.660 --> 11:22.684
YOU MEAN JIMMY NICHOLAS.

11:22.730 --> 11:23.822
YEAH, SOLID JOCKEY,
BAD BET.

11:23.860 --> 11:24.827
HE'S BEEN LOSING LATELY.

11:24.860 --> 11:25.861
THAT'S WHY HE HIRED US.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.891
HE THINKS THAT MAYBE
SOMETHING'S PSYCHICALLY WRONG

11:27.940 --> 11:28.907
WITH THE HORSES.

11:28.940 --> 11:29.964
YEAH, THE HORSES ARE LOSING,

11:30.010 --> 11:31.136
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM.

11:31.180 --> 11:33.068
YEAH, WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.146
(Henry)
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T, THERE'S A
MILLION REASONS A HORSE LOSES,

11:35.180 --> 11:37.956
AND NONE OF 'EM HAVE TO DO
WITH CRYSTALS AND MOONBEAMS.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.069
(announcer)
AND IT'S YOUTHFUL SPIRIT.

11:42.100 --> 11:45.968
YOUTHFUL SPIRIT
PULLS IT OUT.

11:46.010 --> 11:47.500
WHAT I DO IS
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.041
IT'S...IT'S INTUITION.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.048
SON, YOU GOT NO CASE.

11:51.080 --> 11:54.789
OH, WELL, THANKS.
WE'LL JUST GO HOME THEN.

11:54.820 --> 11:56.993
(woman)
JUAN CARLOS!

11:57.030 --> 11:59.669
(man)
HELP HIM!

11:59.700 --> 12:01.429
[man over P.A.]
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
TO THE TRACK.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.001
WE NEED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
TO THE TRACK IMMEDIATELY.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.474
[people shouting]

12:07.520 --> 12:09.112
(man)
CARLOS!

12:12.190 --> 12:13.179
(Shawn)
SO...

12:13.230 --> 12:16.028
A JOCKEY WHO WAS ALIVE
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RACE

12:16.070 --> 12:18.038
IS DEAD BY THE END.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.073
NOT TO SOUND INSENSITIVE,
BUT I SAY WE DO HAVE A CASE.

12:21.110 --> 12:23.544
THAT SOUNDS INSENSITIVE.

12:23.580 --> 12:26.583
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.082
AND YOU GUYS JUST HAPPENED
TO BE AT THE TRACK?

12:30.130 --> 12:32.690
JULES, IT'S
FREE CHURRO DAY.

12:32.730 --> 12:34.061
DO THEY HAVE
A CAUSE OF DEATH YET?

12:34.100 --> 12:36.239
PROBABLE HEART ATTACK.

12:43.190 --> 12:44.817
UH, O'HARA, I...

12:44.860 --> 12:46.054
NEED YOU TO INTERVIEW
THE REST OF THOSE JOCKEYS.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.626
[Juliet sighs]

12:47.660 --> 12:48.729
WHAT IS THAT?

12:48.760 --> 12:50.125
SORRY.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.900
IT'S JUST LITTLE PEOPLE
MAKE ME...

12:52.940 --> 12:55.272
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY I HAD A BAD
EXPERIENCE WITH A CHRISTMAS ELF.

12:55.310 --> 12:57.676
WHAT, HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT PRESENT?

12:57.720 --> 13:00.143
NO.
WE DATED.

13:00.190 --> 13:01.555
AND THEN HE DUMPED ME
FOR A DANCER

13:01.560 --> 13:05.326
FROM THE ICE STORM
ON ICE.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.069
SHE IS AN ENIGMA WRAPPED
IN A LITTLE, BLONDE RIDDLE.

13:09.110 --> 13:13.877
SHAWN, I DON'T THINK JUAN CARLOS
DIED OF A HEART ATTACK.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.239
I ONLY GOT TO SEE HIM
FOR A SECOND,

13:15.280 --> 13:17.339
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
HE HAD BLOODSHOT EYES.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.210
AND HIS BODY
WAS TOTALLY STIFF.

13:19.260 --> 13:20.693
THAT'S A REACTION
TO A TRANQUILIZER

13:20.730 --> 13:21.958
OR EVEN A POISON.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.763
SOMETHING AFFECTED
HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.667
THANK YOU, DR. PRATT.

13:26.710 --> 13:28.177
SEE IF WE CAN GET
ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT BODY.

13:28.210 --> 13:28.972
YOU BET.

13:29.010 --> 13:29.874
HEY, YOU TWO,
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.743
I WAN NA TALK TO YOU
WHEN I'M DONE.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.815
GUS HAS A CRAMP.

13:34.860 --> 13:35.849
I HAVE A CRAMP?

13:37.700 --> 13:38.951
WE HAVE TO PEE.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.264
FINE, JUST BE BACK
IN FIVE MINUTES.

13:42.870 --> 13:43.666
"WE GOTTA PEE?"

13:43.710 --> 13:44.938
THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN
COME UP WITH?

13:44.980 --> 13:45.969
JUST HURRY UP.

13:48.050 --> 13:50.712
REALLY?

13:50.760 --> 13:54.082
HOW SHORT WAS THIS GUY?
GIVE IT ONE MORE.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.064
WE HAVE BOOTS.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.694
WE'VE CONFIRMED THAT
A HEART ATTACK WAS THE CAUSE

13:58.740 --> 14:01.334
OF JUAN CARLOS ESPINOZA'S DEATH.

14:01.380 --> 14:04.770
WAIT.
EVERYONE STOP.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.845
LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CHIEF
IS WEARING LEOPARD PRINT.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.451
AND CONTINUE.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.728
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

14:12.770 --> 14:14.362
A ROSE WITH, WITH, WITH--

14:14.400 --> 14:15.389
A THORN.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.907
NO.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.202
A ROCKET.
RIKKI ROCKET.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.241
C.C. DEVILLE.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.941
DAVID LEE ROTH?
WRONG BAND.

14:20.980 --> 14:21.947
POISON.

14:21.980 --> 14:23.982
YES.

14:24.020 --> 14:25.055
POISON.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.954
JUAN CARLOS

14:28.000 --> 14:28.989
WAS POISON ED.

14:29.030 --> 14:30.361
HE'S RIGHT.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.936
CHIEF, I AM SO SICK
OF LASSITER

14:31.970 --> 14:34.336
TREATING US
LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.177
WHAT?

14:36.210 --> 14:37.814
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:37.850 --> 14:38.817
ESPINOZA HAD A COCKTAIL

14:38.850 --> 14:40.010
OF DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.517
OPIATES, BARBITU RATES,
COCAIN E,

14:41.560 --> 14:43.050
THREE DIFFERENT KINDS
OF WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS,

14:43.090 --> 14:44.125
CYALIS, AND HORSE TRANQUILIZERS.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.889
HORSE TRANQUILIZERS?

14:45.930 --> 14:47.227
APPARENTLY, THE GUY TOOK
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

14:47.270 --> 14:50.000
HE WAS 4'9" AND 3 FEET OF THAT
WERE DRUGS.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.076
AND OBVIOUSLY,
HIS HEART COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

14:52.110 --> 14:55.079
A VERY THOROUGH JOB,
DETECT IVES.

14:55.120 --> 14:55.882
I'M GETTING SOMETHING ELSE.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.458
JUAN CARLOS WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.424
WITH A MARRIED WOMAN.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.961
SHAWN, HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.160
SAME WAY I KNOW
THAT AS A CHILD,

15:04.200 --> 15:08.500
LASSIE WANTED NOTHING MORE
THAN A PONY.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.440
WELL, COME ON,
WHO DIDN'T?

15:10.480 --> 15:13.187
ANYONE WHO WASN'T
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

15:13.220 --> 15:15.484
UH-OH. I SEE A TALL,
BLONDE WOMAN.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.487
BRIGITTE NIELSON?

15:16.530 --> 15:17.428
NO!

15:17.460 --> 15:19.257
SHE HAS 23 DIAMONDS
IN HER WEDDING RING.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.858
AND SHE BANDIES
ABOUT THE TRACK,

15:20.900 --> 15:22.003
THIS WAY AND THAT.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.304
SHOULDN'T WE AT LEAST
FIND THIS WOMAN AND TALK TO HER?

15:24.340 --> 15:26.149
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS, DETECT IVES?

15:28.550 --> 15:31.053
OH, WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD FIND OUT

15:31.090 --> 15:32.387
BEFORE WE PUT THIS CASE
TO BED.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.068
LASSIE...

15:37.100 --> 15:38.658
YOUR CHILDHOOD
MUST'VE BEEN PURE HELL.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.203
THE GOOD NEWS,

15:41.240 --> 15:43.140
I'M AVAILABLE
FOR HUGS.

15:46.450 --> 15:47.656
JULES.

15:47.690 --> 15:49.555
HOW ABOUT IT?

15:50.630 --> 15:52.518
BUDDY.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

15:52.570 --> 15:54.492
PLEASE.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.500
[breathing heavily]

16:05.320 --> 16:06.685
YOU'RE HERE EARLY.

16:06.730 --> 16:09.597
YEAH, COULDN'T SLEEP,
YOU KNOW?

16:09.630 --> 16:10.619
CAME IN EARLY,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.035
DID A LITTLE
WORK ON THE CASE.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.958
WENT FOR A RUN.

16:14.010 --> 16:17.241
OH, AND I DID THIS.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.247
NICE.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.486
I DID SOME WORK AS WELL.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.717
TURNS OUT THE HORSE TRANQUILIZER
JUAN CARLOS HAD IN HIS BODY

16:22.760 --> 16:24.125
WAS KETAMINE.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.718
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.263
'CAUSE KETAMINE CAUSES A STATE
OF AN ESTHESIA.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.029
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, GUS,
BUT I WAS TALKING

16:30.070 --> 16:31.378
ABOUT THE SPITBALL INCIDENT.

16:31.410 --> 16:33.048
THE SPITBALL INCIDENT?

16:33.080 --> 16:35.116
SHAWN, YOU NEED
TO LEAVE THAT ALONE.

16:35.150 --> 16:37.311
IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT
BY NOW, YOU NEVER WILL.

16:37.350 --> 16:39.056
I CAN'T LEAVE IT ALONE.
I WON'T.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.024
I'VE GONE OVER IT IN MY HEAD
A THOUSAND TIMES.

16:41.060 --> 16:42.618
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.144
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:53.190 --> 16:56.125
THIS IS MY HEAD, DUDE.
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.718
WHAT DID WE MISS?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

16:57.760 --> 17:00.365
IS THAT WHAT MY HAIR LOOKS LIKE
IN THE FUTURE?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.594
IT SURE IS.

17:01.640 --> 17:05.337
BUT I THOUGHT
I'D BE BALD BY 20.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.614
YEAH, IT DOES.
THINK BIG.

17:08.650 --> 17:09.617
[Spitball smashes]

17:09.650 --> 17:10.685
AHH!

17:10.720 --> 17:11.709
[kid laughing]

17:13.290 --> 17:18.193
IT WAS JIMMY.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.128
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:20.170 --> 17:23.640
HE'S SIPPING THROUGH THE STRAW,
NOT SPITTING IT OUT.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.704
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIM.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.582
[both]
THERE WAS A SECOND SPITTER.

17:29.630 --> 17:33.168
THAT'S SO COOL.

17:33.200 --> 17:33.962
(Gus)
LET IT GO, SHAWN.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.729
YOUR SECOND SPITTER THEORY
IS CRAZY.

17:35.770 --> 17:37.408
OH YEAH, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR TEEN WOLF THEORY?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.873
HEY, THAT'S JUST A FACT.

17:38.910 --> 17:41.549
IF ANY OF US WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND SOME DUDE BECAME A WOLF,

17:41.580 --> 17:42.717
WE WOULDN'T BE COOL WITH HIM

17:42.750 --> 17:44.411
JUST BECAUSE HE COULD
DUNK A BASKETBALL.

17:44.450 --> 17:46.486
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE SELLING
"I HEART WOLF" T-SHIRTS,

17:46.530 --> 17:47.485
I COULD TELL YOU THAT.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.168
OH, SAVE IT
FOR YOUR PODCAST.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.462
HEY, YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.933
I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO JIMMY NICKLES.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.403
YOU LOOK FOR T.B.W.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.271
T.B.W.?
TALL BLONDE WOMAN.

17:55.310 --> 17:57.505
I ABBREVIATED, GUS. ALL THE KIDS
ARE DOING IT THESE DAYS.

17:57.550 --> 17:58.448
OH.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.482
JUST HOPE WE DON'T
RUN INTO MY--
Y.D.?

18:00.520 --> 18:01.851
Y.D.?
YOUR DAD.

18:01.890 --> 18:03.357
AND IT'S TOO LATE.

18:03.390 --> 18:05.529
OH, MY GOD, THE SHIRT
HAS A BROTHER.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.892
HA, VERY FUNNY, SHAWN.

18:07.940 --> 18:10.261
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR BOY
JIMMY, THEY JUST ANNOUNCED

18:10.310 --> 18:11.937
HE WAS TAKEN OFF
ALL THE RACES FOR THE DAY.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.504
SERIOUSLY?
I WONDER WHY.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.575
ISN'T THAT BARRY SARNER?

18:15.620 --> 18:18.384
THE ANNOUNCER GUY.
HE'S LIKE A LOCAL LEGEND.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.524
YEAH, "THE VOICE," RIGHT?
YEAH.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.528
HEY, DAD, DO YOU KNOW HIM?
CAN YOU INTRODUCE US OR WHAT?

18:22.570 --> 18:24.265
NO, I MET HIM ONCE
AT A POLICEMAN'S BALL,

18:24.300 --> 18:25.267
BUT IT WAS YEARS AGO.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.665
HEY, UH, MR. SARNER.

18:26.710 --> 18:27.734
HI.

18:27.780 --> 18:28.929
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.242
YOUR OLD PAL.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.508
HANK SPENCER.

18:31.550 --> 18:32.471
DO I KNOW YOU?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.784
NO, BUT WE KNOW YOU.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.583
WHAT IS IT YOU ALWAYS SAY?
"AND THE RACE IS ON."

18:36.630 --> 18:37.790
[excitedly]
AND THE RACE IS ON.

18:37.830 --> 18:39.320
[excitedly]
AND THE RACE...

18:39.370 --> 18:40.769
ISSSSSSSS. ..

18:40.800 --> 18:43.462
ONNNNNN!

18:43.510 --> 18:44.772
HEY, CAN YOU DO IT
FOR US ONE TIME?

18:44.810 --> 18:46.539
[flatly]
AND THE RACE IS ON.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.979
[kisses]
THAT'S IT, RIGHT THERE.

18:48.020 --> 18:50.011
WON'T YOU BOYS
HAVE A BUTTON?

18:50.050 --> 18:51.017
I'M SORRY, MR. SARNER.

18:51.050 --> 18:52.483
I'M HENRY SPENCER.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.680
THIS IS MY SON SHAWN
AND HIS FRIEND GUS.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.527
THEY FINALLY JUST STARTED
COMING TO THE RACES.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.299
OH, TOO BAD.

18:58.340 --> 18:59.534
THE TRACK'S PROBABLY
CLOSING DOWN

18:59.570 --> 19:01.504
AFTER THIS MEET.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.940
25 YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS.

19:03.980 --> 19:04.947
(Gus)
WHY IS IT CLOSING DOWN?

19:04.980 --> 19:06.516
WELL, NO ONE
COMES ANYMORE.

19:06.550 --> 19:08.518
IS IT BECAUSE
OF HIS SHIRT?

19:08.560 --> 19:09.652
I'M SORRY, DAD,
THIS IS, LIKE,

19:09.690 --> 19:10.679
A GENOCIDE OF COLOR.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.027
SOMEWHERE,
A RAINBOW'S WEEPING.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.368
MR. SARN ER,

19:13.400 --> 19:14.469
DO YOU KNOW WHY

19:14.500 --> 19:17.003
JIMMY NICKLES WAS PULLED OFF
ALL OF HIS RACES TODAY?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.905
WE'RE HIS BUDDIES.
WE CAME DOWN TO SEE HIM.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.601
NO, UH...

19:20.650 --> 19:22.015
IT'S A SHAME, REALLY.

19:22.050 --> 19:24.587
JIMMY WAS JUST GETTING BACK
TO A FULL SCHEDULE.

19:24.620 --> 19:25.848
JUAN CARLOS HAD TAKEN
MOST OF HIS GOOD MOUNTS

19:25.890 --> 19:26.857
BEFORE HE DIED.

19:26.890 --> 19:28.551
REALLY?
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.433
OH, THEY QUARRELED ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.596
DID THEY?

19:32.640 --> 19:33.959
SHAWN, LOOK.

19:34.010 --> 19:37.047
T.B.W.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.139
WAY TO STAY ON
THE ABBREVIATION TRAIN, GUS.

19:39.180 --> 19:41.455
YOU MEAN THE A.T.?

19:41.490 --> 19:43.629
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JANINE?
THAT'S JIMMY'S WIFE.

19:43.660 --> 19:47.630
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

19:47.670 --> 19:49.467
T.B.W. IS JIMMY'S WIFE?

19:49.510 --> 19:50.465
YES.

19:50.510 --> 19:51.636
LOOKS LIKE JUAN CARLOS

19:51.680 --> 19:53.102
WAS TAKING ALL
OF JIMMY'S MOUNTS.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.457
I DIDN'T KILL
JUAN CARLOS!

19:59.490 --> 20:01.594
I DIDN'T DO IT,
I SWEAR!

20:01.630 --> 20:02.392
COME ON!

20:02.400 --> 20:03.594
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME!

20:03.630 --> 20:04.699
BACK OFF.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.779
(Gus)
OKAY, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

20:09.810 --> 20:11.175
YOU TOOK ON THIS CASE
BECAUSE YOU FELT BAD

20:11.220 --> 20:12.778
ABOUT JIMMY GETTING
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL

20:12.820 --> 20:14.117
FOR SOMETHING
HE DIDN'T DO.

20:14.150 --> 20:15.549
AND NOW YOU JUST CONVINCED
THE POLICE

20:15.590 --> 20:16.488
TO REOPEN THE CASE

20:16.530 --> 20:19.988
THAT LED TO JIMMY
BEING ARRESTED FOR MURDER.

20:20.030 --> 20:23.033
DID I ASK
FOR NUTSHELLING?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.031
(Shawn)
I THINK HE LOOKS
LIKE A TANGELO IN THAT OUTFIT.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.015
OR MAYBE A CLEMENTINE
WITH SEEDS FULL OF HATE.

20:29.050 --> 20:31.018
I THINK HE LOOKS LIKE
AN EVIL LITTLE CREAMSICLE.

20:31.050 --> 20:33.154
[laughs]
YOU MEAN DREAMSICLE.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.158
NO, SHAWN,
CREAMSICLE.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.999
THEY'RE EXCLUSIVELY ORANGE.

20:37.030 --> 20:39.828
OKAY, LASSITER SAYS YOU CAN HAVE
FIVE MINUTES WITH JIMMY.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.064
SWEET.

20:41.110 --> 20:42.600
AND GOOD JOB, BY THE WAY.

20:42.650 --> 20:43.969
WE NEVER WOULD'VE
REOPENED THE CASE

20:44.010 --> 20:46.786
AND ARRESTED HIM
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.117
YOU DIDN'T TELL JIMMY THAT,
DID YOU?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.627
NO.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.150
[both sighing]

20:51.190 --> 20:52.999
I DIDN'T KILL
JUAN CARLOS.

20:53.030 --> 20:54.019
WE KNOW.

20:54.070 --> 20:55.628
SOMEONE MUST'VE TIPPED
'EM OFF.

20:55.670 --> 20:56.967
BUT I SWEAR
I DIDN'T DO IT.

20:57.010 --> 21:00.070
SAY JIMMY, ISN'T THAT
EXACTLY LIKE YOU

21:00.110 --> 21:02.169
AND THAT SPITBALL INCIDENT?

21:02.220 --> 21:03.847
[kicking]

21:03.890 --> 21:05.585
[kicking]

21:05.620 --> 21:07.121
(Jimmy)
GUYS!

21:07.160 --> 21:07.956
LOOK...

21:07.990 --> 21:10.220
I THINK WHAT GUS
IS TRYING TO SAY IS

21:10.260 --> 21:11.295
WE'D REALLY LIKE TO HELP.

21:11.340 --> 21:13.035
WE WOULD,
BUT THE EVIDENCE.

21:13.070 --> 21:14.037
WHAT?

21:14.070 --> 21:15.935
JUAN CARLOS
TOOK ALL YOUR MOUNTS.
YEAH.

21:15.980 --> 21:17.174
YOU FOUGHT WITH HIM
OVER IT.
YEAH.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.347
THEY FOUND KETAMINE
IN YOUR LOCKER.

21:18.380 --> 21:19.677
THAT WASN'T MINE.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.142
AND YOUR WIFE
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR

21:21.190 --> 21:23.010
WITH JUAN CARLOS.
WHAT?!

21:25.060 --> 21:29.190
ALL RIGHT, PURVIS,
PUT ME DOWN.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.332
DON'T PUSH ME.

21:30.370 --> 21:32.804
I'M GETTING THE FEELING
HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.807
YOU THINK?

21:33.850 --> 21:35.215
I'M SORRY, I JUST--

21:35.250 --> 21:36.786
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE WOULD DO THAT.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.048
ESPECIALLY AFTER I TOLD HER

21:38.090 --> 21:41.218
I WOULDN'T SLEEP
WITH ANY MORE RUSSIAN MODELS.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.262
[Silently]

21:43.300 --> 21:45.791
I THINK WE MAY HAVE
GOTTEN OFF POINT, JIMMY.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.671
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE BEGINNING.

21:47.710 --> 21:49.200
OBVIOUSLY,
THE RACES

21:49.240 --> 21:51.845
YOU LOST ARE SOMEHOW CONNECTED
TO JUAN CARLOS'S MURDER.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.211
SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN TELL US

21:53.250 --> 21:56.117
OR THAT YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT THOSE RACES?

21:56.160 --> 21:58.424
NO. THE HORSES WERE ALL
RUNNING GREAT.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.690
BUT RIGHT AROUND THE, UH,
CLUBHOUSE TURN,

22:00.730 --> 22:02.630
THEY ALL FADED
DOWN THE STRETCH.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.801
ALL OF THEM FADED
DOWN THE STRETCH?

22:04.840 --> 22:07.274
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:07.310 --> 22:08.277
YEAH.

22:08.310 --> 22:10.289
GOOD.
[knocks table]

22:10.320 --> 22:11.912
THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.329
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH,
SHAWN, LET'S GO.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.395
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
AT THAT THING FOR AN HOUR.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.931
LET ME TAKE OFF MY SHOES
AND TRY IT LYING DOWN.

22:21.980 --> 22:23.845
NO, SHAWN.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.871
IT'S A DEAD END.
FACE IT.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.182
WE HAVE TO TELL JIMMY
HE'S SCREWED.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.915
FINE.
YOU TELL JIMMY.

22:28.960 --> 22:29.949
ME?

22:29.990 --> 22:31.059
I NEVER WANTED TO TAKE THIS CASE

22:31.090 --> 22:34.321
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

22:34.370 --> 22:35.189
I'LL RACE YOU FOR IT.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.208
WHAT?!
NO.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.379
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I KNOW WHY.

22:39.410 --> 22:40.399
WHY?

22:40.450 --> 22:41.371
'CAUSE I BEAT YOU IN THE

22:41.420 --> 22:42.887
100-YARD DASH
IN THE JUNIOR HIGH OLYMPICS.

22:42.920 --> 22:43.841
PLEASE!

22:43.890 --> 22:45.778
FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW I HAD
SHIN SPLINTS,

22:45.820 --> 22:47.799
A TORN MENISCUS,
AND A PLANTER'S WART.

22:47.830 --> 22:49.229
GUS, YOU COPIED THOSE TERMS

22:49.260 --> 22:50.864
FROM THE GLOSSARY
OF OUR HEALTH TEXTBOOK.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.128
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY MEAN!

22:52.170 --> 22:53.159
ASK MY DOCTOR.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.303
I HAD A RUPTURED PATELLA TOO,

22:54.340 --> 22:56.308
BUT I WASN'T GONNA
SAY ANYTHING.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.911
BESIDES...

22:58.950 --> 23:00.110
GO!
OH, NO!

23:00.150 --> 23:01.981
NO, YOU DIDN'T!
OH!

23:02.020 --> 23:04.386
[Shawn straining loudly]

23:10.310 --> 23:14.269
[yelling and gasping]

23:14.310 --> 23:16.141
[panﬁng]

23:16.180 --> 23:18.410
YOU ALMOST HAD ME.

23:18.460 --> 23:21.384
WHAT?
I HAD YOU BY AT LEAST A FOOT.

23:21.430 --> 23:24.319
I'M GONNA GIVE THIS TO YOU.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.337
I THOUGHT SO.

23:25.370 --> 23:26.234
NOT BECAUSE YOU WON.

23:26.270 --> 23:28.534
'CAUSE YOU NEED A VICTORY
IN YOUR LIFE

23:28.580 --> 23:29.899
MORE THAN I DO RIGHT NOW.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.339
WHAT?

23:31.380 --> 23:34.019
OH, NO.
WE'RE GOING AGAIN.

23:34.050 --> 23:36.382
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

23:36.430 --> 23:39.092
(Gus)
SEVEN FLIGHTS OF STAIRS

23:39.130 --> 23:40.893
JUST TO GET ANOTHER VIEW
OF THE TRACK?

23:40.930 --> 23:43.103
GUS, THIS IS THE PERFECT SPOT

23:43.140 --> 23:44.107
FOR US TO SEE--

23:44.140 --> 23:45.232
YOU'LL FIND--

23:45.270 --> 23:46.498
TO SEE WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.417
I TOLD YOU
HE'D BE HERE.

23:49.450 --> 23:50.610
CAN I HELP YOU FELLAS?

23:50.650 --> 23:53.153
UH, YEAH, UH...

23:53.190 --> 23:55.351
"AND THE RACE IS ON."

23:55.400 --> 23:58.130
I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE UP HERE RIGHT NOW.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.467
I'M TRYING TO FINISH

23:59.500 --> 24:01.104
MY TAPED ANNOUNCEMENTS
FOR THE DAY, SO...

24:01.140 --> 24:02.232
OOH, CAN I DO ONE?

24:02.280 --> 24:02.871
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE AN ANNOUNCER.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.269
WOULD THE OWNER
OF A RED IROC-Z

24:05.310 --> 24:07.039
IN LOT THREE
KINDLY RETURN

24:07.090 --> 24:08.409
YOUR COMB TO THE BACK POCKET

24:08.460 --> 24:11.156

24:11.190 --> 24:14.660
AND TURN OFF YOUR HEADLIGHTS.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.258

OF THAT, HUH?

24:16.300 --> 24:17.528
HAVE A BUTTON.

24:17.570 --> 24:18.229
(Gus)
HEY.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.044
I'VE SEEN ONE OF THESE BEFORE.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.219

24:26.120 --> 24:27.724

24:30.330 --> 24:32.491
LONG-STANDING RIVALS
OF THE SLEESTAK COWBOYS.

24:32.540 --> 24:35.361
IT'S PRONOUNCED CHOE-KOE.

24:35.410 --> 24:37.446
GAVE US THE CHOCODILE,
AMONGST OTHER THINGS.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.175
I DON'T THINK SO.

24:39.220 --> 24:40.585
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING

24:40.620 --> 24:42.383
TH ESE ARTIFACT S
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

24:42.420 --> 24:45.548
I'M ACTUALLY 1/ 16 INDIAN MYSELF,

24:45.600 --> 24:46.669
BUT NOT CHEROKEE.

24:46.700 --> 24:49.362
HEY, GUS IS...1/16 ROBOT.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.231

TAKE-OVER-TH E-WORLD

24:51.270 --> 24:52.635

24:57.520 --> 25:00.489
HEY, YOU'RE THE GUY THAT TRIED
TO SAVE JUAN CARLOS.

25:00.530 --> 25:01.326
YEAH...

25:01.360 --> 25:02.554
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO TRIED TO HELP.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.420
WAY TO GO.
YOU SHOULD FEEL PROUD.

25:04.470 --> 25:05.459
YEAH.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.502
UH, HE DIED.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.132
YES, HE DID DO THAT.

25:09.180 --> 25:10.306
YEAH.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.813
WELL, GENTLEMEN, UH...
[clears throat]

25:15.860 --> 25:18.090
RYAN AND I HAVE TO GO OVER
SOME PUBLICITY PHOTOS.

25:18.130 --> 25:19.529
SO IF YOU'D BE KIND ENOUGH...

25:19.560 --> 25:23.599
"AND THE RACE IS ON!"

25:23.640 --> 25:25.574
CHAKA?
REALLY?

25:25.610 --> 25:27.271
YEAH, I'D BE EMBARRASSED
IF I WERE YOU.

25:27.310 --> 25:28.618
I'M NOT EMBARRASSED
AT ALL, GUS.

25:28.650 --> 25:29.639
A LAND OF THE LOST
REFERENCE

25:29.680 --> 25:31.580
IS VIRTUALLY UNHEARD OF
IN EVERYDAY CONVERSATION.

25:31.620 --> 25:32.814
CAN WE GO AND SEE
JIMMY NOW?

25:32.860 --> 25:33.656
NOT YET.

25:33.690 --> 25:36.227
BARRY HAS TAPES
OF THE RACES IN THERE.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.262
WHICH MEANS THERE'S A COPY
OF THE ONE JUAN CARLOS DIED IN.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.562
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS BEFORE.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.669
WE NEED TO SEE THAT TAPE.

25:40.710 --> 25:43.247
THERE'S NO WAY BARRY'S
GONNA LET US BACK IN THERE.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.349
DON'T THE POLICE HAVE
A COPY OF IT?

25:44.380 --> 25:46.712
THEY DO, BUT LASSITER'S
CONVINCED THE CASE IS CLOSED,

25:46.750 --> 25:47.978
SO HE WON'T HELP.

25:48.020 --> 25:50.659
WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING I KNOW I WILL REGRET.

25:50.690 --> 25:53.193
WHAT? RIDE YOUR DIRT BIKE
OFF OF DAVID KING'S ROOF AGAIN?

25:53.230 --> 25:54.697
NO...

25:54.730 --> 25:58.131
ASK MY DAD FOR A FAVOR.

25:58.180 --> 26:02.310
SO I WAS HOPING THAT IN YOUR
VERY METICULOUS, DETAILED MODE,

26:02.350 --> 26:04.113
IT OCCURRED TO YOU TO...

26:07.490 --> 26:09.629
I CAN'T DO IT.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.594
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU TAPE
ALL THE HORSE RACES.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.664
OF COURSE I DO.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.533
AWESOME. CAN WE WATCH THE ONE
WHEN JUAN CARLOS DIED?

26:15.580 --> 26:17.241
YOU MAY.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.679
ON ONE CONDITION.

26:23.390 --> 26:26.518
DEAL IS YOU GO WITH ME
TO THE DERBY ON SUNDAY

26:26.560 --> 26:28.699
IN THAT SHIRT.

26:28.740 --> 26:30.628
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT REGRET, GUS?

26:30.670 --> 26:31.637
WHAT DID I SAY?

26:31.680 --> 26:32.704
I THINK YOU PULL IT OFF.

26:32.740 --> 26:35.311
SHAWN.

26:35.350 --> 26:36.578
FINE.

26:36.620 --> 26:38.656
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE RACE.

26:38.690 --> 26:39.918
JUAN CARLOS
IS ON THE NUMBER EIGHT HORSE.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.518
I REMEMBER THIS, 'CAUSE PHIL
CONVINCED ME

26:41.560 --> 26:42.697
TO GO WITH THE LONG SHOT.

26:42.730 --> 26:43.822
THE ONE TIME I GO
WITH THE GUY,

26:43.870 --> 26:46.737
AND THE HORSE LOSES.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.704
I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT ARE WE MISSING?

26:48.740 --> 26:49.934
WHAT--WHAT AREN'T WE SEEING?

26:49.980 --> 26:51.242
MAYBE NOTHING.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.282
MAYBE JIMMY DID POISON
JUAN CARLOS.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.480
(Shawn)
I KNOW HE DIDN'T
POISON JUAN CARLOS,

26:54.520 --> 26:56.454
JUST LIKE I KNOW
THERE'S A SECOND SPITTER.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.787
SHAWN, ONCE AGAIN, YOU'RE
FOCUSING TOO MUCH ATTENTION

26:57.830 --> 26:59.422
ON ONE ASPECT OF THE CASE.

26:59.460 --> 27:00.427
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

27:00.460 --> 27:01.427
NO, I'M NOT JUMPING THROUGH

27:01.470 --> 27:02.368
ANY MORE OF YOUR HOOPS TODAY.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.230
YOU NEED TO BROADEN
YOUR VISION, SHAWN.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.038
YOU NEED TO LOOK
AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CASE.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.672
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

27:07.710 --> 27:08.938
BROADEN MY VISION?

27:08.980 --> 27:10.982
LOOK AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF A--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:11.020 --> 27:12.612
I'M OUT OF HERE.
NO.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.525
NO, NO.
NOT TODAY.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.822
YOU SOUND LIKE OPRAH.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.566
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I BOTHER COMING HERE.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.966
IT'S A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

27:24.450 --> 27:27.010
A LITTLE GIRL OUTSIDE
JUST STARTED CRYING

27:27.050 --> 27:29.052
WHEN SHE SAW THIS SHIRT.

27:34.530 --> 27:35.861
OH, GOOD, GOOD,
YOU'RE HERE.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.003
YOU TEXTED ME SEVEN TIMES.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.007
SAID IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.769
YES, A COLOR EMERGENCY.

27:39.810 --> 27:40.799
BUT I THINK
I FIGURED IT OUT.

27:40.850 --> 27:43.011
THE WALLS WERE SANDBAR WHITE

27:43.050 --> 27:45.541
TO SUPPRESS ALL CREATIVE THOUGHT
AND HIDE THE ASBESTOS.

27:45.590 --> 27:46.818
THE WALLS OF WHAT?

27:46.860 --> 27:48.555
MISS LEPKY'S CLASSROOM.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.921
WHY IS MY NAME
ON THE DETENTION LIST?

27:50.970 --> 27:52.767
YOU GOT CAUGHT
EATING A KIT KAT

27:52.800 --> 27:54.006
OUT OF THE TRASH CAN.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.008
THE POINT IS,
WHEN I LEFT MY DAD'S--

27:56.040 --> 27:57.746
YOU MEAN STORMED OUT
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL?

27:57.780 --> 27:59.873
I DID NOT.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.785
I DID.

28:01.820 --> 28:03.356
I'D GIVE YOU THAT.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.419
I REALIZED MY DAD
WAS ACTUALLY RIGHT.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.064
I NEEDED TO BROADEN
MY VISION,

28:07.100 --> 28:08.897
AND THAT'S WHEN I REMEMBERED

28:08.940 --> 28:11.966
WE ALL SWITCHED SEATS
IN CLASS THAT WEEK.

28:12.010 --> 28:14.899
RIGHT, I HAD TO SIT BEHIND JANIE
DORAN AND HER CREEPY NECK HAIR.

28:14.950 --> 28:17.646
AND JIMMY...

28:17.690 --> 28:19.885
MOVED OVER TWO ROWS,

28:19.920 --> 28:22.024
MEANING THAT
THE SECOND SPITTER

28:22.060 --> 28:24.893
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

28:24.930 --> 28:26.966
GUS, GET HIM.

28:27.010 --> 28:29.069
SHAWN, WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH HORSE RACING?

28:29.110 --> 28:30.873
MM-MM, I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THAT FAR YET.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.616
LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.592
LET GO, JIMMY.

28:42.070 --> 28:43.662
[cell phone ringing]
HELLO?

28:43.710 --> 28:45.666
[Shawn on phone]
DUDE, I FIGURED IT OUT.

28:45.710 --> 28:47.507
WAS THAT REALLY
NECESSARY?

28:47.550 --> 28:48.949
NO.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.208
BUT IT WAS DOPE.

28:52.760 --> 28:53.988
[Barry on TV]
BABYFACED ASSASSIN

28:54.030 --> 28:54.849
STRIDES INTO THE FIRST TURN
AT THE HEAD

28:54.890 --> 28:56.596
WITH NONE OTHER
RIGHT ON ITS TAIL.

28:56.630 --> 28:57.597
BABYFACED ASSASSIN--

28:57.630 --> 28:58.961
WAIT FOR IT.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.262

AS THEY RACE AROUND

29:00.300 --> 29:01.608

29:02.740 --> 29:05.049
RIGHT THERE!
THE CLUBHOUSE TURN.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.718
JUAN CARLOS
GETS HIT BY SOMETHING.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.183
THIS WAS JUST LIKE
THE SPITBALL

29:08.220 --> 29:09.551
INCIDENT WITH JIMMY.

29:09.590 --> 29:10.386
I WAS SO FOCUSED ON THE STRETCH

29:10.420 --> 29:11.796
THAT I NEVER LOOKED
ANYWHERE ELSE.

29:11.830 --> 29:15.095
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T BROADEN
MY VISION, DAD.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.734
SHAWN, I LOVE NOTHING MORE
THAN TO TELL YOU I'M RIGHT,

29:16.770 --> 29:18.601
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M RIGHT ABOUT.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.107
QUESTION IS WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
KILL SOMEONE LIKE THAT?

29:20.140 --> 29:21.641
[sighs]

29:27.220 --> 29:28.027

29:28.060 --> 29:29.049

29:29.100 --> 29:30.795
WAS AN ACCIDENT--YEAH!

29:30.830 --> 29:32.138
WHATEVER HIT HIM
WAS MEANT FOR A HORSE.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.762
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MURDER.

29:33.810 --> 29:36.802
IT'S ABOUT FIXING RACES.

29:43.060 --> 29:43.822

29:43.860 --> 29:45.157

WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

30:26.210 --> 30:28.770
IF YOU WANTED--

30:28.820 --> 30:30.071
THOSE TAPES.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.382
WHAT ARE ON THOSE TAPES?

30:31.420 --> 30:32.956
THEY'RE THE TAPES
FROM THE TRACK.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.150

FIND ANYTHING.

30:54.170 --> 30:58.402

30:58.440 --> 31:02.319

THESE ARE JIMMY'S RACES.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.193
THIS ONE IS WHEN
JUAN CARLOS DIED.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.969
THAT MUST BE WHY
THEY'RE IN MY HEAD.

31:15.010 --> 31:16.477

DOWN THE STRETCH,

31:17.510 --> 31:19.046
AS IF AFFECTED BY SOMETHING.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.980
AND LOOK HERE.

31:21.020 --> 31:23.386
JUAN CARLOS IS CLEARLY
HIT BY SOMETHING

31:23.420 --> 31:24.455
AT THE CLUBHOUSE TURN.

31:24.490 --> 31:25.923
HE FELT THE EFFECTS
IMMEDIATELY,

31:25.960 --> 31:28.019
BECAUSE HE'S A TINY
HUMAN PERSON.

31:28.070 --> 31:29.332
WITH THE HORSES,
IT TAKES LONGER

31:29.370 --> 31:30.462
FOR THEM TO FEEL THE EFFECTS.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.104
AND YOUR POINT IS?

31:32.140 --> 31:35.439
WHATEVER HIT JUAN CARLOS
WAS INTENDED FOR HIS HORSE.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.289
WHAT I'M SAYING

31:37.320 --> 31:39.083
IS THAT THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.826
MR. SPENCER, THAT'S
A VERY INTERESTING THEORY,

31:40.860 --> 31:42.327
BUT IT'S ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

32:02.570 --> 32:03.366
IT'S THE ANNOUNCER.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.561
HE SOUNDS SURPRISED.

32:05.610 --> 32:07.202
[whinnies]
"NEIGH," SHOCKED.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.400
WHEN YOUTHFUL SPIRIT
DOESN'T FADE

32:08.450 --> 32:10.315
DOWN THE STRETCH,

32:10.350 --> 32:11.578
LISTEN--

32:11.620 --> 32:13.417
[Barry on TV]
YOUTHFUL SPIRIT
FADES DOWN THE STRETCH.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.280
NO, WAIT, HE'S--
HE'S GAINING.

32:15.330 --> 32:16.399
IT'S YOUTHFUL SPIRIT.

32:16.430 --> 32:18.569
YOUTHFUL SPIRIT PULLS IT OUT!

32:18.600 --> 32:19.999
HE WAS EXPECTING

32:20.040 --> 32:21.530
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN
TO JUAN CARLOS'S HORSE.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.106
THAT MEANS HE'S A PART OF IT.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.903
CHIEF, EVERY PSYCHIC NERVE
IN MY BODY TELLS ME

32:24.950 --> 32:26.110
THAT SOMETHING REALLY BIG
IS GONNA HAPPEN AT THE DERBY

32:26.150 --> 32:29.415
TOMORROW AND THAT WE ALL NEED
TO BE THERE.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.257
ALL RIGHT.

32:31.290 --> 32:32.325
IT'S TOO LATE
TO CANCEL THE RACES,

32:32.360 --> 32:36.296
BUT I CAN APPROVE A POLICE
PRESENCE AT THE TRACK.

32:36.340 --> 32:39.229
[crowds chattering]

32:41.650 --> 32:43.208
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE JOCKEY
CLUB BEFORE, SHAWN.

32:43.250 --> 32:44.683
THANKS FOR GETTING ME
IN HERE.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.518
IT'S A GOOD THING WE WORE
OUR LUCKY SHIRTS, HUH?

32:47.560 --> 32:50.120
YEAH, JUST WORRIED SOMEONE'S
GONNA STARE DIRECTLY

32:50.160 --> 32:52.264
AT THE PATTERN
AND HAVE A SEIZURE.

32:52.300 --> 32:55.531
[call to post]

32:55.570 --> 32:58.573
SHAWN, WE'VE HAD PEOPLE WATCHING
BARRY FOR THE LAST SIX RACES,

32:58.610 --> 33:00.646
AND THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.649
ADMIT IT, YOU GUYS
DON'T HAVE IT.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.295
DON'T WORRY.
WE HAVE IT.

33:06.330 --> 33:07.524
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE HAVE IT.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.765
WE JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT
HOW IT ALL CONNECTS.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.268
SO WHAT IS THIS INDIAN STUFF I
GOT OFF THE INTERNET CONNECT TO?

33:12.310 --> 33:14.608
THAT'S WHAT WE IN THE FAKE
PSYCHIC COMMUNITY CALL A HUNCH.

33:14.650 --> 33:16.709
[Barry over P.A.]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

33:16.750 --> 33:18.547
THE HORSES HAVE REACHED
THE STARTING GATE

33:18.590 --> 33:20.649
FOR THE 84TH RUNNING

33:20.690 --> 33:22.419
OF THE SANTA BARBARA DERBY.

33:22.460 --> 33:24.462
[bell ringing]

33:24.500 --> 33:25.660
(Barry)
AND THE RACE IS ON.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.736
UH-OH, TWO HORSES BUMP
AS THEY COME OUT OF THE GATE.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.408
IT'S THE THREE HORSE,
SNARE THE PRIZE,

33:29.440 --> 33:30.372
AND THE FOUR,
BIASED OPINION.

33:30.410 --> 33:32.378
KATE'S CONSCIENCE
TAKES THE EARLY LEAD

33:32.410 --> 33:34.412
AS THE HORSES REACH
THE FIRST TURN.

33:34.450 --> 33:37.556
AUTHORITY FIGURE MAKES
A STRONG MOVE ON THE INSIDE

33:37.590 --> 33:39.126
AS THE HORSES
RACE DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.422
AUTHORITY FIGURE
AND KATE'S CONSCIENCE

33:40.460 --> 33:41.768
BATTLE THEIR WAY
PAST THE FALL TURN.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.688
AUTHORITY FIGURE
BEGINS TO TAKE CONTROL.

33:43.740 --> 33:44.729
AUTHORITY FIGURE...

33:47.580 --> 33:50.344
[camera shutters clicking]

34:02.640 --> 34:03.675
(Henry)
PHIL IS NOT A PAL.

34:03.710 --> 34:06.110
HE'S A BAD GAMBLER
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT.

34:06.150 --> 34:07.845
BUT HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
ON A HOT STREAK.

34:07.880 --> 34:12.226
HENRY TELL YA I LIKE
THE 2-3-4 TRIFECT A BOX? HUH?

34:12.260 --> 34:15.593
TRACK'S PROBABLY CLOSING DOWN
AFTER THIS MEET.

34:15.630 --> 34:18.758
25 YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS.

34:18.810 --> 34:22.371
DUDE, I GOT IT.
GET EVERYONE DOWN TO THE TRACK.

34:22.420 --> 34:26.811
(Barry)
AND AUTHORITY FIGURE WINS
WITH EASE.

34:26.860 --> 34:30.523
I REALLY WOULD LIKE
TO CASH IN MY TICKETS NOW.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.664
WELL, HOW DID SHE FEEL COMING
AROUND THE BACKSTRETCH?

34:32.700 --> 34:34.668
EVERYBODY HOLD YOUR HORSES.

34:34.710 --> 34:37.679
[horse whinnies]

34:37.710 --> 34:39.940
I MEANT METAPHORICALLY,
BUT I LIKE THE LOVE.

34:39.980 --> 34:41.743
I SENSE THE PLAN.

34:41.790 --> 34:44.350
HATCHED FROM THE DESPERATION
OF WATCHING THE TRACK

34:44.390 --> 34:46.790
THEY ALL LOVE SO MUCH
SHUTTERED FOREVER.

34:46.830 --> 34:48.627
ISN'T THAT RIGHT...

34:48.670 --> 34:49.637
BARRY?

34:49.670 --> 34:50.796
EXCUSE ME?

34:50.840 --> 34:53.229
YOU ARE SO NOT EXCUSED.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.475
YOU SEE, THE TRACK
IS CLOSING DOWN

34:55.510 --> 34:59.458
THIS YEAR, AND BARRY FINALLY
FIGURED OUT A WAY TO GET PAID.

34:59.490 --> 35:00.855
BUT IT WAS THE EQUINE

35:00.890 --> 35:03.529
WHO TOLD ME HE HAD HELP.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.869
TWO PEOPLE WITH INTIMATE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE RACES

35:05.900 --> 35:07.902
AND ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE TRACK.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.636
THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO CONTROL
THE OUTCOME OF THE RACES

35:10.680 --> 35:12.898
BY GETTING RID
OF THE FAVORITES.

35:12.950 --> 35:14.781
BECAUSE THERE WERE ONLY
A FEW HORSES

35:14.820 --> 35:15.912
IN THE RACE TO BEGIN WITH,

35:15.950 --> 35:16.917
THEY BET ON
THE REST OF THE FIELD,

35:16.960 --> 35:17.915
AND THEIR ODDS OF WINNING

35:17.960 --> 35:19.496
WENT WAY UP.

35:19.530 --> 35:20.929
THAT IS INSANE.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.461
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.604
THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.
WHOA.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.629
WHOA, WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

35:25.670 --> 35:26.705
GUS, LITTLE HELP,
BUDDY.

35:26.740 --> 35:27.934
I DON'T DO HORSES, SHAWN.

35:27.980 --> 35:28.947
AH, DALE.

35:28.980 --> 35:31.778
DALE, UH,
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.492
WHAT WAS I SAYING?

35:40.540 --> 35:42.633
BARRY WAS SAYING
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

35:42.670 --> 35:43.830
(Shawn)
REALLY?

35:43.880 --> 35:45.541
YOU USED PHIL

35:45.580 --> 35:47.047
TO MAKE ALL THE BETS
ON THE LONG SHOTS.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.115
AND RYAN HERE--

35:48.150 --> 35:51.688
WELL, HE TOOK CARE
OF KNOCKING OUT THE FAVORITES

35:51.730 --> 35:52.890
FROM HIS PERCH
IN THE CAMERA WELL.

35:52.930 --> 35:54.568
WITH WHAT,
HIS CAMERA?

35:54.600 --> 35:55.567
EXACTLY.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.737
LASSIE, DO ME A FAVOR.

35:56.770 --> 35:59.000
TAKE THAT CAMERA
OFF RYAN'S NECK.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.200
GIVE IT A LOOK.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.786
THERE'S NO LENS.

36:05.820 --> 36:07.924
IT'S SOME KIND
OF FIRING MECHANISM.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.450
WHICH IS WHY HE DIDN'T

36:09.500 --> 36:11.024
FOLLOW THE HORSES
DOWN THE TRACK.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.630
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SOME MONEY.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.864
IT WAS BARRY'S IDEA.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.437
SHUT UP, RYAN.
THEY CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.435
(Shawn)
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.038
A FRACTION.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.911
1/5.

36:20.950 --> 36:22.918
1/10.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.689
1/16.

36:24.730 --> 36:27.051
BARRY'S 1/ 16 CHOCO INDIAN.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.568
(Shawn)
AND WHAT ARE THE CHOCO INDIANS
KNOWN FOR?

36:29.600 --> 36:30.567
BESIDES CHOCODILES.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.398
FOR USING BLOWGUNS
TO KILL ANIMALS WITH DARTS

36:33.440 --> 36:34.805
DIPPED IN POISON.

36:34.850 --> 36:36.511
(Shawn)
GUS SHOOTS AND SCORES.

36:36.550 --> 36:38.984
WITH AN ASSIST
FROM WIKIPEDIA.

36:39.020 --> 36:40.954
THEY USED DARTS
DIPPED IN KETAMINE.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.628
A HORSE TRANQUILIZER
STRONG ENOUGH

36:42.660 --> 36:44.560
TO SLOW DOWN A HORSE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A RACE.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.022
WITH DARTS SMALL ENOUGH
TO BE MISSED

36:46.070 --> 36:47.697
ON A 1,000-POUND HORSE.

36:47.740 --> 36:49.503
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS...

36:49.540 --> 36:52.008
THEY ACCIDENTALLY SHOT
JUAN CARLOS.

36:52.050 --> 36:54.610
THE KETAMINE, MIXED WITH ALL
THE OTHER DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM,

36:54.650 --> 36:57.756
AND THE ADRENALINE
FROM THE RACE KILLED HIM.

37:00.830 --> 37:01.819
RYAN .

37:01.870 --> 37:04.088
YOU WEREN'T TRYING TO SAVE
JUAN CARLOS'S LIFE.

37:04.140 --> 37:06.631
YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR THE EVIDENCE.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.214
AND THEY ALMOST
PULLED IT OFF

37:12.250 --> 37:14.081
BY FRAMING POOR JIMMY.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.587
BUT THEY COULDN'T RESIST

37:15.630 --> 37:18.622
ONE MORE BIG PAY DAY
IN TODAY'S RACE.

37:21.170 --> 37:23.638
IT'S LIKE MY DAD
ALWAYS SAYS...

37:23.680 --> 37:25.671
REAL MEN
TAKE BUBBLE BATHS.

37:25.710 --> 37:28.110
AND...

37:28.150 --> 37:30.084
A BAD GAMBLER
NEVER KNOWS WHEN TO QUIT.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.155
NOT BAD, KID.

37:31.190 --> 37:32.726
NOT BAD.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.762
LET'S GO.
GET 'EM OUT OF HERE.

37:35.930 --> 37:37.136
NOW...

37:37.170 --> 37:39.058
WHO WANTS TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH
THE WINNING HORSE AND JOCKEY?

37:39.110 --> 37:40.930
COME ON, DAD!
GUS, GET OVER HERE.

37:40.980 --> 37:43.141
HEY, I FINALLY GET
MY PICTURE

37:43.180 --> 37:44.716
WITH US IN OUR TRACK SHIRTS.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.889
MEMORIES, SHAWN.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.057
JUST ACT NATURAL.
YEAH.

37:48.090 --> 37:51.093
[camera shutter clicks]

37:53.870 --> 37:55.269
GUYS, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

37:55.310 --> 37:57.642
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT SUCH TOTAL
FARTKNOCKERS AFTER ALL.

37:57.680 --> 37:58.840
THAN KS.

37:58.880 --> 38:02.247
THAT'S...SO SWEET.

38:02.290 --> 38:06.021
GUS, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING YOU
WANTED TO SAY TO JIMMY HERE?

38:09.800 --> 38:12.598
YES, I DO.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.777
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SAY THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

38:13.810 --> 38:14.777
YOU KNOW, BACK IN SCHOOL--

38:14.810 --> 38:16.971
OH, UH, ABOUT THAT.

38:17.020 --> 38:20.057
I HAD SOME TIME TO THINK
WHILE I WAS IN JAIL, AND, UH...

38:20.090 --> 38:21.978
MAYBE I DIDN'T TREAT YOU GUYS
SO GOOD BACK THEN.

38:22.030 --> 38:23.395
ESPECIALLY YOU, GUSTER.

38:23.430 --> 38:24.294
SO I'M SORRY.

38:24.330 --> 38:26.161
I'M SORRY FOR
GIVING YOU WEDGIES,

38:26.200 --> 38:28.862

38:34.450 --> 38:35.610
[chuckles]
WHEW.

38:35.650 --> 38:38.653
FEELS GOOD TO GET THAT OFF MY
CHEST AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

38:38.690 --> 38:41.659
HUH, YEAH.
I COULD IMAGINE.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.133
SAY, SHAWN,

38:43.170 --> 38:46.708
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO GET OFF OF YOUR CHEST?

38:46.740 --> 38:48.401
ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM
IF I DON'T?

38:48.450 --> 38:49.417
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:49.450 --> 38:52.248
[sighs]

38:52.290 --> 38:54.850
ALL RIGHT, JIMMY,
HERE'S THE THING.

38:54.890 --> 38:57.723
I'M THE ONE THAT RATTED YOU OUT
OVER THE SPITBALL INCIDENT.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.397
OKAY, I'M THE ONE
THAT GOT YOU KICKED

38:59.440 --> 39:01.738
OUT OF SCHOOL, AND I AM THE ONE
THAT YOU SHOULD BLAME

39:01.770 --> 39:03.909
FOR ALMOST RUINING YOUR LIFE,
IT WAS ME.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.189
[laughing]

39:08.220 --> 39:09.039
ALMOST RUINING MY LIFE?

39:09.090 --> 39:11.479
YEAH, I WENT TO LIVE
WITH MY DAD IN MAUI.

39:11.530 --> 39:13.350
HE LET ME DO
ANYTHING I WANTED.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.766
I ATE PIZZA
AND COOKIE DOUGH FOR BREAKFAST.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.336
I HAD A RACE CAR BED.

39:17.370 --> 39:18.462
I LOST MY VIRGINITY
AT 13.

39:18.510 --> 39:20.728
IT WAS THE GREATEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

39:20.780 --> 39:22.509
[horn honks]

39:22.550 --> 39:24.415
HI!

39:24.450 --> 39:26.850
OH.

39:26.890 --> 39:27.982
YOU TWO ARE BACK TOGETHER, HUH?

39:28.030 --> 39:30.828
DUDE, SHE'S A FORMER
MISS OXNARD

39:30.860 --> 39:32.225
WITH NO SENSE OF SMELL,

39:32.270 --> 39:34.329
AND HER DAD
OWNS AN AIRPORT.

39:34.370 --> 39:35.439
COURSE WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

39:35.470 --> 39:37.472
LATRO, BOYS.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.518
OKAY, SEE...

39:48.570 --> 39:50.936
THAT RIGHT THERE MAKES
TOTAL SENSE IN THE WORLD.

39:50.970 --> 39:53.803
YEAH, BUT WE CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT SOLVING THE CASE.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.501
EH...

39:55.550 --> 39:58.075
DON'T YOU "EH" ME.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.553
DUDE, I BROKE UP
A HIGHLY INTRICATE

39:59.590 --> 40:01.080
RACE-FIXING SYNDICATE

40:01.120 --> 40:02.894
WHILE WEARING A SHIRT
DESIGNED BY A MONKEY

40:02.930 --> 40:04.192
COMING OFF A THREE-DAY
SUGAR BINGE.

40:04.230 --> 40:05.868
YES, YES, YOU DID, SHAWN.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.959
BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED
OUT WHO THE SECOND SPITTER WAS

40:08.010 --> 40:10.171
IN MISS LEPKY'S CLASS.

40:10.210 --> 40:13.873
[chuckling]

40:13.920 --> 40:16.480
GUS.
YES?

40:16.520 --> 40:18.579
YOU DIDN'T.

40:18.630 --> 40:22.896
YES, I DID.

40:22.940 --> 40:25.500
AHH!

40:25.540 --> 40:27.201
[laughing]

40:37.160 --> 40:39.094
YOU DID THAT?

40:39.130 --> 40:40.461
AND YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT IT?

40:40.500 --> 40:42.001
YOU DON'T KNOW
ALL MY SECRETS, SHAWN.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.203
I GUESS I TOO AM A MAN
OF UNTOLD MYSTERIES.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.239
BURTON GUSTER,

40:46.280 --> 40:48.487
I AM SEEING YOU
IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LIGHT.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.579
YOU ARE, DARE I SAY,

40:50.620 --> 40:51.689
DASTARDLY.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.598
HEY, I DIDN'T WANT MISS LEPKY
TO GET HURT OR ANYTHING,

40:54.630 --> 40:55.995
BUT WHEN JIMMY GOT BLAMED,

40:56.030 --> 40:57.031
MY MOUTH WAS SHUT.

40:57.070 --> 40:57.695
UNBELIEVABLE.

40:57.740 --> 40:58.707
FACE IT, SHAWN.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.332
I AM,
AND ALWAYS WILL BE,

41:00.380 --> 41:02.507
THAT GOOD.

41:02.550 --> 41:04.916
THAT'S WHY MY FRIENDS IN SCHOOL
USED TO CALL ME "THE G."

41:04.920 --> 41:07.150
HUH, THAT'S FUNNY, I THOUGHT
THEY CALLED YOU

41:07.190 --> 41:08.726
"BIG HEAD BURTON."

41:08.760 --> 41:10.159
DON'T YOU EVER
SAY THAT NAME.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.656
I KNOW IT WAS YOU
THAT STARTED THAT.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.565
I'M SORRY, GUS.
I HAVE A KNACK FOR ALLITERATION.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.589
I'M A SLAVE TO IT.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.029
BESIDES, HOW MANY WORDS
START WITH B, REALLY?

41:17.080 --> 41:19.139
ABOUT 1,000.

41:19.180 --> 41:21.341
HOW ABOUT BOLD?
BLACK? BEAUTIFUL?

41:21.380 --> 41:22.711
WHO'S GONNA CALL YOU
"BLACK BURTON"?

41:22.750 --> 41:24.411
YOU GET MY POINT, SHAWN.

41:24.460 --> 41:25.757
ALL RIGHT.

41:25.790 --> 41:27.018
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.596
I'M GONNA BUY YOU
AN ICE CREAM.

41:28.630 --> 41:32.407
AND WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS SOME
NEW, FRESH TO DEATH NICKNAMES.

41:40.060 --> 41:42.085
HOW ABOUT...

41:42.130 --> 41:48.069
"BURTON,
THE BILLOWY BEAR"?

41:48.110 --> 41:50.806
WHAT?

41:50.840 --> 41:52.068
I'M JUST SPITBALLING.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.078
IT'S MY FIRST SHOT.
