"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

01:57.708 --> 02:04.083
"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

02:04.583 --> 02:10.208
"I've chosen you... you choose me too."

02:10.708 --> 02:14.208
"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

02:43.583 --> 02:49.625
"No girl ever takes the first step."

02:50.125 --> 02:55.458
"She never utters a word unless her heart's helpless."

02:55.958 --> 03:02.625
"She never utters a word unless her heart's helpless."

03:03.125 --> 03:05.916
"My heart's crossed all limits of happiness."

03:06.416 --> 03:12.458
"I wish to spend rest of my life with you."

03:12.958 --> 03:19.083
"Come weave these dreams of love with me."

03:19.583 --> 03:25.833
"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

03:26.333 --> 03:32.166
"I've chosen you... you choose me too."

03:32.666 --> 03:36.166
"O beloved..."

04:02.666 --> 04:05.291
Come inside, please.

04:05.791 --> 04:09.000
When did you two get married?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.458
Marriage?

04:10.958 --> 04:11.833
Well...it was winter.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.458
People were wearing warm clothes.

04:15.958 --> 04:17.250
Why don't you tell them if you know?

04:17.750 --> 04:18.833
25th October, doctor.

04:19.333 --> 04:22.458
25th October!

04:22.958 --> 04:23.625
How long have you two been married?

04:24.125 --> 04:24.791
4 years! - 4 years!

04:25.291 --> 04:25.916
4 years!

04:26.416 --> 04:27.583
When did the problem begin?

04:28.083 --> 04:29.666
I mean...tell me from the beginning.

04:30.166 --> 04:32.916
Doctor, this is happened 4 years ago.

04:33.416 --> 04:37.375
I was a small kid. - Kid? Her?

04:37.875 --> 04:39.833
Can I talk?

04:40.333 --> 04:41.583
I was very young.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.250
I loved a boy called Raja Awasthi.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.333
This man tricked me into marrying him..

04:46.833 --> 04:47.416
What?

04:47.916 --> 04:49.083
Can I talk?

04:49.583 --> 04:52.208
Can I share my view..

04:52.708 --> 04:54.250
You talk, Doctor, I am going to sit there.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.000
Let me know.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.583
See...what did I say?

04:59.083 --> 05:00.125
This is what happens.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.083
It's okay. - Dr. Goswami, I am a doctor too..

05:02.583 --> 05:03.125
..and in my professional opinion..

05:03.625 --> 05:06.250
..my wife is suffering from a bipolar disorder.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.666
She has anxiety issues, acute hysteria.

05:09.166 --> 05:09.458
Thyroid problems.

05:09.958 --> 05:11.583
We got all the tests done for thyroid..

05:12.083 --> 05:15.041
..the results were negative. You..

05:15.541 --> 05:19.750
Go ahead and lie...go on.

05:20.250 --> 05:20.958
Hormonal issues.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.458
You know, some days she's absolutely fine.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.333
And then suddenly she's grieving.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.208
Some days she gets furious over trivial matters..

05:27.708 --> 05:28.666
..and suddenly she's fine again.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.833
You know, if she starts quarrelling, she can't stop.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.791
And if she's fine... she's fine.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.333
See the pattern, it's like a.. - Mr. Sharma.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.041
According to this, all the women in the world are bipolar.

05:38.541 --> 05:41.000
And I think, according to your description..

05:41.500 --> 05:43.166
..she seems absolutely fine.

05:43.666 --> 05:46.000
Mrs. Sharma, you tell us.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.583
Doctor, I'll tell you from the beginning.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.333
My name is Tanuja Trivedi.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.500
I am a resident of Kanpur, Virana Road.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.458
I loved a boy.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.208
But this man fell in love with me.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.250
He tricked me into marrying him..

06:00.750 --> 06:01.583
..and brought me to London.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.041
I thought he's a successful doctor..

06:03.541 --> 06:05.458
..but, he barely makes ends meet.

06:05.958 --> 06:07.208
Earlier, we lived at South Hall.

06:07.708 --> 06:09.416
Where people hang their underwear outside their home.

06:09.916 --> 06:12.000
He finally changed home after I kept insisting.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.083
We lived outside London, in the country.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.000
Except for 5 pigeons..

06:15.500 --> 06:19.625
..and 3 raccoons, I don't see a single soul out there.

06:20.125 --> 06:22.250
Calm down, dear. Please take this.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.958
So...was he always like this?

06:25.458 --> 06:26.708
He wasn't always like this.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.625
The first year was nice.

06:29.125 --> 06:31.625
There was love, excitement, sex..

06:32.125 --> 06:34.125
We would go out, have candle-night dinner.

06:34.625 --> 06:35.750
Drink beer in the pub.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.666
But slowly he started showing his true colors.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.333
Everything just went 'poof'.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.541
Went where?

06:41.041 --> 06:44.208
What? - I mean...it disappeared.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.041
Vanished. - Vanished.

06:46.541 --> 06:48.041
What should I do for excitement?

06:48.541 --> 06:51.208
I can dance.. - You think you can dance, Manu Sharma.

06:51.708 --> 06:52.458
Have you seen your condition?

06:52.958 --> 06:54.000
There's no meat left on your bones.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.625
This man's growing like a ginger.

06:56.125 --> 06:56.750
Sprouting from all directions.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.625
I wasn't exactly Hrithik Roshan before we got married.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.875
I was always like this. - You were like this.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.500
No personality or sense of humor.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.333
So...you could've married Raju Srivastav.

07:06.833 --> 07:07.916
Look, I can give her a stable life..

07:08.416 --> 07:09.083
..I can't crack jokes.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.916
He can never crack jokes, he's the ultimate boring man.

07:12.416 --> 07:14.041
Ask him about his weekend plans, and he'll say..

07:14.541 --> 07:15.583
..there's a 25% discount at Tesco..

07:16.083 --> 07:16.750
..let's go shopping.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.625
Let's go for a stroll around the lake. If I ask him for a party..

07:19.125 --> 07:21.458
..then he calls four of his friends from IIT along with their wife.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.708
There's not much difference between them..

07:24.208 --> 07:25.083
..and my aunty from Rampur.

07:25.583 --> 07:26.750
I had such a happening life in India..

07:27.250 --> 07:28.708
..but he's completely messed up my life.

07:29.208 --> 07:29.666
What?

07:30.166 --> 07:32.583
Messed up - What?

07:33.083 --> 07:38.458
It means...destroyed. - Destroyed.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.208
Destroyed.

07:41.708 --> 07:45.541
I never...even made a cup of tea for my father.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.458
But I washed this man's clothes.

07:47.958 --> 07:50.458
Cooked for him. He said, start a children's crche..

07:50.958 --> 07:51.750
..to keep yourself busy.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.875
I did that too. But he still doesn't respect me.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.000
I thought he'll change.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.250
It'll juice up our life.

07:59.750 --> 08:00.958
A girl has so many dreams

08:01.458 --> 08:04.458
when she agrees for a love-marriage.

08:04.958 --> 08:08.125
But I think I love him, but I stopped liking him.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.708
I think I love him like a mammal.

08:11.208 --> 08:11.833
Like a Homo-sapien.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.000
Stop this.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.708
It's all a lie, absurd.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.000
It was never a love-marriage.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.125
We had an arranged marriage.

08:17.625 --> 08:18.583
And why did you think I will change?

08:19.083 --> 08:20.666
Did we meet on some bridge, with my arms open wide?

08:21.166 --> 08:22.083
I was formally dressed, when I came to see her..

08:22.583 --> 08:23.791
..along with my parents. - That was a nice pair of clothes.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.833
So, I did come to your house. - Please let him speak.

08:26.333 --> 08:29.083
We got married with the consent of her parents.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.082
And I am no fruit to juice-up again.

08:32.582 --> 08:35.582
Dr. Moris, how many different ways can one say "I Love You".

08:36.082 --> 08:36.707
No spark! No spark!

08:37.207 --> 08:38.582
I am a man, not a lighter.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.416
And let me tell you about her spark.

08:40.916 --> 08:43.416
She hit my friend Mathur's wife on the head with a coke bottle.

08:43.916 --> 08:44.833
People stopped visiting us.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.958
And the Crche... Ask her how did that shut down?

08:47.458 --> 08:48.625
She gave alcohol to the children to shut them up.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.166
There was a police case. I was nearly arrested.

08:51.666 --> 08:53.625
And this woman flirts around in the pub...with foreigners.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.750
Right in front of me! - Who else should I do it with? You?

08:57.250 --> 09:00.083
I tried that once. But you're just a dead body.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.166
Why shouldn't I flirt around?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.000
There's a 5000 year old history of atrocities against woman.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.250
Have I been committing atrocities against women for 5000 years!

09:05.750 --> 09:06.416
Will you take revenge only on me?

09:06.916 --> 09:08.250
Men are doing it. All men are alike.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.583
As long as you get sex.. - What sex?

09:11.083 --> 09:12.833
It happened back in 2013.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.708
He remembers that. He remembers that. - Yes.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.625
That was the only thing worth remembering. - Calm...

09:17.125 --> 09:19.958
Calm down. - Please!

09:20.458 --> 09:21.833
Please calm down!

09:22.333 --> 09:25.333
Sorry.

09:25.833 --> 09:30.000
Doctor, I think he's a pervert.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.958
The way he stares at girls..

09:32.458 --> 09:33.958
What do you mean? - It's like he'll devour them.

09:34.458 --> 09:35.000
He's a lecher.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.416
I.. I never even gave that look to my wife.

09:37.916 --> 09:39.541
Why would I look at other girls like that?

09:40.041 --> 09:41.125
When he came to Kanpur, to see me..

09:41.625 --> 09:42.625
..he kissed me when I was asleep.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.833
Without my consent. Without my awareness.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.875
Ask him...ask him.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.041
I was descent enough to tell you that.

09:49.541 --> 09:50.833
You didn't know.. - You were drunk like a log. - No.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.791
You were drunk.. - Calm down.

09:53.291 --> 09:53.625
Calm down.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.666
Calm down. Calm down. Please calm down.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.750
Did you kiss me or not? - Yes, I did! I did!

09:58.250 --> 09:59.583
I made a big mistake. - Calm down!

10:00.083 --> 10:00.583
Calm down please.

10:01.083 --> 10:01.833
I won't spare you!

10:02.333 --> 10:03.250
I won't spare you!

10:03.750 --> 10:04.625
Crazy girl... witch.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.291
Relax. - Catch her!

10:06.791 --> 10:10.041
You're making a big mistake, Dr. Goswami by letting this woman out.

10:10.541 --> 10:11.625
She has ruined my life.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.333
Now she'll ruin other lives too. This is illegal. Leave me.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.666
Tanu, stop them.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.666
Leave me.

11:27.958 --> 11:30.541
Hello. - Tanu! Good news!

11:31.041 --> 11:33.291
You've become an aunty.

11:33.791 --> 11:34.458
Boy or girl?

11:34.958 --> 11:36.833
Girl... Little girl.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.083
And the father's right here. He's stuffing his face.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.208
Hello, feed me too, I gave birth to her.

11:41.708 --> 11:46.333
Where are you? How's your husband?

11:46.833 --> 11:49.291
Where's Mr. Sharma?

11:49.791 --> 11:51.625
He's in the mental asylum. - What?

11:52.125 --> 11:54.583
If he behaves madly in front of a psychiatrist..

11:55.083 --> 11:56.833
..then they're bound to think he's crazy.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.291
They kept him there.

11:58.791 --> 12:00.291
What are you saying? I don't understand.

12:00.791 --> 12:04.541
Where are you now?

12:05.041 --> 12:07.458
I am in London. - I know you're in London.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.708
But are you okay.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.041
I don't know.

12:13.541 --> 12:17.041
I am thinking about going back to Kanpur.

12:21.625 --> 12:23.458
Place the mask over your nose and mouth..

12:23.958 --> 12:27.458
..and tighten by pulling the straps.

12:40.208 --> 12:41.375
Here...go.

12:41.875 --> 12:42.375
Poor.

12:42.875 --> 12:43.375
Yes, come on.

12:43.875 --> 12:45.166
Be careful, the children might spill it.

12:45.666 --> 12:46.750
We'll distribute it to everyone out here.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.208
Come.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.166
Hello. - Where's the pickle?

12:50.666 --> 12:51.333
Who is it?

12:51.833 --> 12:52.416
Tanu speaking.

12:52.916 --> 12:54.250
Sister-in-law!

12:54.750 --> 12:55.625
Hello.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.458
You forgot all about us after shifting to London.

12:58.958 --> 13:00.458
Hold on, sister-in-law.

13:00.958 --> 13:01.875
The network's really bad in here.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.583
You know, it's an auspicious day today.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.875
And look who called.

13:07.375 --> 13:07.958
Pappi. - Yes.

13:08.458 --> 13:11.208
Manu is in the mental asylum.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.000
So please get him out.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.458
No, no.. - What happened?

13:15.958 --> 13:16.416
Nothing.

13:16.916 --> 13:17.958
St. Benedict Mental Asylum..

13:18.458 --> 13:19.875
..for Mental Illness, in Trikanham.

13:20.375 --> 13:21.791
What? What was that?

13:22.291 --> 13:22.958
Come again.

13:23.458 --> 13:24.666
I'll text you the details.

13:25.166 --> 13:25.916
But please hurry up.

13:26.416 --> 13:29.833
It's been 2-3 days and he doesn't have his phone or credit card.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.083
Oh, God!

13:31.583 --> 13:34.166
The only son of Sharma Family is in a mental asylum.

13:34.666 --> 13:38.166
Please get him out as soon as you can.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.416
Was it your sister-in-law? - Yes.

13:43.916 --> 13:45.500
What's wrong with you?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.041
Speak up.

13:48.541 --> 13:50.083
Manu... - Manu what?

13:50.583 --> 13:51.875
Manu what?

13:52.375 --> 13:53.458
He's in the mental asylum.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.166
Passengers, your attention please.

13:55.666 --> 13:57.750
The train arriving from Delhi..

13:58.250 --> 14:01.958
Train no. 12717..

14:02.458 --> 14:07.875
... is arrived at plate farm no 5.

14:08.375 --> 14:10.333
Did you get married, Deepak? - Yes.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.250
I even have a 5 year old daughter.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.625
I couldn't decide on any one for a long time.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.375
But then father passed away.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.041
And my elder brother refused to support me.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.250
I left collage because of money.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.416
I needed someone to look after the family.

14:22.916 --> 14:25.083
Do you miss me?

14:25.583 --> 14:25.875
Yes.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.791
Not often, only sometimes.

14:28.291 --> 14:30.125
When?

14:30.625 --> 14:34.125
When?

14:40.875 --> 14:42.208
Tanu aunty is back!

14:42.708 --> 14:44.250
Tanu aunty is back!

14:44.750 --> 14:45.875
Mom, dad...

14:46.375 --> 14:48.208
Sister-in-law, Tanu is back.

14:48.708 --> 14:49.958
Aunty is back.

14:50.458 --> 14:51.291
Tanu aunty is back!

14:51.791 --> 14:52.833
Tanu aunty is back!

14:53.333 --> 14:57.875
Sister, I'll go get the veneration platter. - Hurry up.

14:58.375 --> 15:01.958
This is for your girl. - Don't embarrass me.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.958
Keep it. - You think I'll charge you money.

15:07.791 --> 15:08.833
I have such sweet memories about you.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.625
Time and age ruined everything.

15:13.125 --> 15:17.125
Yes, I'll you, let's go in..

15:17.625 --> 15:18.583
Let's go inside.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.416
It was nice meeting you, Deepak.

15:20.916 --> 15:21.541
Bye.

15:22.041 --> 15:22.583
See you.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.541
Uncle. - Bless you, dear. how are you?

15:25.041 --> 15:27.208
Hello, uncle. - Fine.

15:27.708 --> 15:30.083
Papa. - I'm going to buy vegetables from the market.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.208
Who was that, dear? - He was a friend.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.208
Friend? She has a rickshaw driver friend.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.166
How are you, dear?

15:36.666 --> 15:38.041
That rickshaw-puller is your friend.

15:38.541 --> 15:39.625
How can she have a rickshaw puller as a friend?

15:40.125 --> 15:40.583
Be quiet.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.000
Dear, how did you come so suddenly?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.250
Is everything okay? - Yes, everything alright.

15:44.750 --> 15:45.750
How is Manu?

15:46.250 --> 15:47.375
He's in the mental asylum.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.500
What?

15:50.000 --> 15:54.250
But.. - We learnt a wonderful dance just for you.

15:54.750 --> 15:55.958
It's better than Katrina.

15:56.458 --> 16:00.083
Later.

16:00.583 --> 16:03.208
Who's that guy?

16:03.708 --> 16:05.583
Chintu, from Rampur.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.000
What's he doing?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.125
After you got married..

16:08.625 --> 16:10.583
..brother rented out your room to him.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.208
He's been living here for the past 6 months..

16:12.708 --> 16:13.958
..without paying a single penny.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.458
He's studying law at the university.

16:15.958 --> 16:16.375
Every time we ask him to vacate..

16:16.875 --> 16:17.791
..he threatens us with the law.

16:18.291 --> 16:21.375
I suggested that we shut him out.

16:21.875 --> 16:24.458
But that rascal, uses a ladder to climb up.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.833
He's a scoundrel.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.458
But you don't get into all this, dear.

16:28.958 --> 16:31.791
Freshen up and let's have some tea.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.958
Son...

16:34.458 --> 16:35.291
3 days.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.083
I want you to vacate the room in 3 days.

16:37.583 --> 16:41.833
Otherwise...or I'll pass judgment on you on Virana Road.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.500
If Lucknow is romantic, Kanpur is industrial

16:46.000 --> 16:46.750
Listen carefully.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.208
Don't forget to applaud.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.333
If Lucknow is romantic, Kanpur is industrial

16:52.833 --> 16:54.083
Bareli is naughty

16:54.583 --> 16:57.166
Then Rampur is witty!

16:57.666 --> 16:59.458
I won't leave easily.

16:59.958 --> 17:01.666
You're free to give your judgment.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.458
He's a big scoundrel.

17:03.958 --> 17:05.125
You don't get into this.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.915
Neetu...check the lentil.

17:09.415 --> 17:13.415
Sister-in-law, you picked out all the cottage cheese.

17:13.915 --> 17:16.458
There's no cottage-cheese left in this dish.

17:16.958 --> 17:19.040
They finished off the cottage-cheese.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.625
Don't force me to tell them about you.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.208
Be quiet.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.540
Sister-in-law, make some tea for me.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.165
Then go sleep.

17:27.665 --> 17:29.291
You're neither watching the video nor letting me watch it.

17:29.791 --> 17:34.291
You're only making this worse.

17:34.791 --> 17:37.083
Yeah. Yeah. - Look at that. Have you been there?

17:37.583 --> 17:39.083
Hold on. - Look at that.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.916
Wait.

17:41.416 --> 17:43.375
Hello. - Pappi. Have you reached London?

17:43.875 --> 17:44.958
Did you get brother out of the mental asylum?

17:45.458 --> 17:47.458
Sister-in-law, the ticket cost 60,000 rupees..

17:47.958 --> 17:51.708
..so it didn't feel right to head to the mental asylum directly.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.666
So I thought... I am on the Thames right now.

17:54.166 --> 17:54.875
Are you crazy?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.833
Do you know what a mental asylum is?

17:57.333 --> 17:58.625
Be quiet.

17:59.125 --> 18:00.291
Do you know what it means?

18:00.791 --> 18:03.208
Yes, sister-in-law. - So get him out.

18:03.708 --> 18:08.250
And text me as soon as you do. - Yes.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.791
Look at that.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.625
I heard a lot about you, until now.

18:14.125 --> 18:16.000
We never got a chance to meet.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.083
You know, Tanu you're the Batman of this neighborhood.

18:19.583 --> 18:20.958
We only hear stories about you.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.291
I heard there were two grooms in your marriage.

18:23.791 --> 18:26.250
Shots were fired too.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.291
Such sad eyes.

18:29.791 --> 18:31.958
Where did you get those?

18:32.458 --> 18:33.583
How about some tea, sister?

18:34.083 --> 18:37.041
Are you just being formal, or do you respect me as one.

18:37.541 --> 18:41.833
I also have a bottle.

18:42.333 --> 18:45.000
Sign here? - Yes, sir.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.291
You can take him now, sir.

18:46.791 --> 18:50.291
Thank you. - Welcome.

19:02.791 --> 19:06.875
The beard suits you.

19:07.375 --> 19:08.541
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

19:09.041 --> 19:11.375
Didn't you get the ones with the stripes?

19:11.875 --> 19:13.416
His humor is running.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.083
Are you okay?

19:15.583 --> 19:18.333
Brother, I am in love.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.208
Thank you. Thank you.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.416
Remember that girl in Jassi's marriage. Komal.

19:22.916 --> 19:28.166
She's given the nod.

19:28.666 --> 19:31.375
Look...two crazy guys are playing chess.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.166
Now you have to help me get married.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.875
After all, I am 34 years old.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.833
I have needs too. Try to understand.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.500
This is what makes a man turn criminal. Understand.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.250
Taxi! - Stop. Stop.

19:41.750 --> 19:42.291
Astrid Kemp, please.

19:42.791 --> 19:43.916
I told Komal's family..

19:44.416 --> 19:45.791
..that I am very close to the Sharma family.

19:46.291 --> 19:48.916
And uncle's booked a shop for me in Greater Noida.

19:49.416 --> 19:51.250
And he'll leave 1 million for me.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.000
Oh my...what a beautiful house.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.291
Is it rented?

19:55.791 --> 19:57.375
I think I'll have to elope with Komal.

19:57.875 --> 19:58.833
What do you say?

19:59.333 --> 20:00.958
If her family doesn't agree..

20:01.458 --> 20:02.791
..then that's my last resort.

20:03.291 --> 20:04.750
Hear my plan. The plan is like this..

20:05.250 --> 20:06.541
The plane will land in Delhi, okay.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.708
And from Delhi we'll head straight to Punjab..

20:09.208 --> 20:11.541
Speak softly. - Okay.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.291
From Delhi, we'll take a bus..

20:14.791 --> 20:16.125
..and head straight to Punjab. Okay.

20:16.625 --> 20:20.000
Now your job is to talk to Komal's parents in Punjabi.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.458
How? Well...like you do normally? Hi...hello.

20:23.958 --> 20:26.416
This way they will feel comfortable.

20:26.916 --> 20:29.000
All well if they say yes..

20:29.500 --> 20:31.166
..if not, I'll elope with the girl.

20:31.666 --> 20:33.958
And then...

20:34.458 --> 20:35.958
Shut up!

20:36.458 --> 20:37.750
Are you crazy?

20:38.250 --> 20:39.208
Do you see my condition!

20:39.708 --> 20:41.958
This is what happens to a man post-marriage.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.458
I was in a mental asylum for 5 days.

20:43.958 --> 20:47.125
Do you want to go there too? Do you?

20:47.625 --> 20:51.125
Crazy fool wants to get married.

20:55.041 --> 20:58.333
Tanu. How much longer will you take?

20:58.833 --> 21:00.083
Hurry up, dear.

21:00.583 --> 21:04.625
The boy and his family will be here soon.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.958
Tanu. The boy and his family will be here soon.

21:07.458 --> 21:11.500
You should see him too. How is Ankita looking?

21:12.000 --> 21:15.500
Neetu, have the sweetmeats arrived.

21:22.583 --> 21:26.875
So you're out, beloved.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.208
Give the kids some space to walk, he might drop the glasses.

21:29.708 --> 21:30.791
Try these.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.166
He's such a rascal. Whenever we have guest, he's washing his clothes.

21:34.666 --> 21:37.958
Do you have to do that now? - I have to.

21:38.458 --> 21:41.000
Mister, these days hair threading is available in Kanpur too.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.000
You have a big patch.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.125
There's a clinic next to the lake.

21:46.625 --> 21:49.875
They charge 10,000 and guarantee long hair.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.000
May be.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.000
Tanu?

22:03.541 --> 22:07.041
Hello.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.166
She's our daughter. Tanu.

22:17.666 --> 22:19.000
She recently returned from London.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.291
London - Yes, London.

22:21.791 --> 22:25.291
You see, out there everything is open.

22:25.791 --> 22:29.833
Open...you see.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.000
So who is the boy here?

22:33.500 --> 22:36.958
Who is the boy!

22:37.458 --> 22:38.458
What do you do for a living?

22:38.958 --> 22:41.291
What do you do for a living?

22:41.791 --> 22:43.375
I.. - I!

22:43.875 --> 22:45.875
I.. - I!

22:46.375 --> 22:49.875
I work for a IT Firm in Hyderabad.

22:56.083 --> 22:56.625
IT...

22:57.125 --> 22:59.291
Bloody they all work for an IT firm, huh!

22:59.791 --> 23:01.916
They all work in a computer shop.

23:02.416 --> 23:03.416
Why do you want to get married?

23:03.916 --> 23:07.125
Why do you want to get married?

23:07.625 --> 23:08.708
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

23:09.208 --> 23:11.000
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

23:11.500 --> 23:12.833
Have you ever been to a club?

23:13.333 --> 23:16.458
Have you ever been to a club?

23:16.958 --> 23:20.041
Ankita, my dear little Susie.

23:20.541 --> 23:21.500
It's nothing.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.916
Your life has become boring.

23:25.416 --> 23:26.791
And for that you don't need to..

23:27.291 --> 23:32.375
..get this 70 kilos of burden on top of you.

23:32.875 --> 23:37.208
You just need to break the monotony.

23:37.708 --> 23:38.958
Do something exciting.

23:39.458 --> 23:39.916
Anything.

23:40.416 --> 23:41.375
Run away from home with someone.

23:41.875 --> 23:43.916
If you can't find someone, then run away alone.

23:44.416 --> 23:45.000
But do something.

23:45.500 --> 23:50.333
Let there be light, let there be life.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.875
She's humiliated us, let's go.

23:53.375 --> 23:57.375
Mister.. Listen...please..

23:57.875 --> 24:01.375
At least have a glass of water.

24:04.291 --> 24:07.791
You're back..

24:10.541 --> 24:14.041
Now we all suffer. - Listen to me, brother.

24:19.291 --> 24:23.041
Will you stop laughing?

24:23.541 --> 24:23.915
Papa...

24:23.916 --> 24:24.625
I want a divorce.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.250
Go ahead if you want to.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.375
Someday I'll get furious and.

24:28.875 --> 24:30.333
But why?

24:30.833 --> 24:34.166
There's nothing left between us to talk.

24:34.666 --> 24:36.500
We fight over every trivial thing.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.666
She doesn't understand, neither do I.

24:39.166 --> 24:39.791
Uncle's been drinking.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.833
And this mental asylum incident was just too much.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.625
How did you land in the mental asylum?

24:46.125 --> 24:49.250
I can't make break bread for him at midnight.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.250
What more can I do? I'll keep it aside, they'll eat it cold.

24:52.750 --> 24:53.166
Mannu.

24:53.666 --> 24:54.958
I'm was being tortured for the past 4 years.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.375
Don't forget to eat. - We will.

24:57.875 --> 24:58.458
We all are.

24:58.958 --> 25:01.833
Your wife won't come feed you. I am not destined to have a daughter-in-law.

25:02.333 --> 25:07.750
Look at me...I've been enduring it for 40 years.

25:08.250 --> 25:12.166
And I am sure, so is your mother.

25:12.666 --> 25:15.333
Who will clean all the dirty plates in the sink?

25:15.833 --> 25:18.333
So.. - So what?

25:18.833 --> 25:19.916
Manage it.

25:20.416 --> 25:23.208
And then...there's this.

25:23.708 --> 25:27.166
Sometimes with water...or with soda.

25:27.666 --> 25:29.958
And sometimes neat.

25:30.458 --> 25:32.458
What do you think will happen after divorce?

25:32.958 --> 25:36.833
Either you will spend the rest of your life alone.

25:37.333 --> 25:38.916
All the lights in the rooms are switched on.

25:39.416 --> 25:40.750
All the lights are on.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.291
You'll get bored...with living alone.

25:43.791 --> 25:46.416
Or...you'll get married again.

25:46.916 --> 25:49.625
And after the second marriage..

25:50.125 --> 25:54.625
..do you think she will make you happy?

25:55.125 --> 25:56.750
How can we clean it with the lights off?

25:57.250 --> 26:01.458
You're too much.

26:01.958 --> 26:06.375
Son...it's the rule of life.

26:06.875 --> 26:11.416
A man and a woman are supposed to fall in love.

26:11.916 --> 26:12.875
Then getting married..

26:13.375 --> 26:15.791
..and then, getting bored of each other.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.041
That's right.

26:17.541 --> 26:22.416
That's why I say... endure it for as long as you can.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.916
And when you give up.

26:26.416 --> 26:27.375
What happened?

26:27.875 --> 26:28.458
Save electricity.

26:28.958 --> 26:29.750
I say divorce her.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.583
You're like a closed door and sister-in-law is like the breeze.

26:32.083 --> 26:32.916
You two can never get along.

26:33.416 --> 26:35.166
I told you before this marriage will never last.

26:35.666 --> 26:37.958
You can't temper lentil with ajinamoto.

26:38.458 --> 26:39.541
Look, a criminal.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.375
Mister. Where can I get a divorce?

26:42.875 --> 26:44.250
I'll show you. There's Faisal.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.250
There he is. Faisal.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.791
Brother Faisal has a record of 2500 divorces.

26:49.291 --> 26:51.375
Once he got a couple divorced on the following day of their wedding.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.125
Come.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.041
Greeting, brother. - Get going.

26:55.541 --> 26:56.125
Sit down.

26:56.625 --> 26:59.625
Sit down.

27:00.125 --> 27:03.708
Mister, I want to send a divorce notice.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.458
Of course. Just say the word.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.875
Brother.. Think about it once.

27:10.375 --> 27:14.000
I mean...think about it once.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.833
So...which notice should I send her?

27:16.333 --> 27:19.583
Divorce notice or just notice?

27:20.083 --> 27:20.458
What?

27:20.958 --> 27:21.916
Well, the divorce notice means..

27:22.416 --> 27:25.791
..everything's finalized... marriage over!

27:26.291 --> 27:33.625
But, with just a notice you still have some chance left.

27:34.125 --> 27:36.458
Take my advice, and just send her a notice.

27:36.958 --> 27:38.791
This is just the beginning. You're the emotional type.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.458
You can never say "Divorce! Divorce! Divorce!"

27:42.958 --> 27:47.291
And you see...marriage is an expensive game.

27:47.791 --> 27:48.333
And divorce.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.500
Well, you can get one for as cheap as 250- rupees.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.958
Name?

27:53.458 --> 27:56.958
Hold on.

28:03.041 --> 28:04.458
Should I call him? - Yes.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.541
Say sorry? - Yes.

28:07.041 --> 28:09.458
Say "Call that stupid fool".

28:09.958 --> 28:11.708
Call that stupid fool

28:12.208 --> 28:15.708
Here.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.000
Here, Tanu. Have some sweets.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.416
I cleared my final year of law.

28:22.916 --> 28:24.916
Chintu, you didn't call me sister.

28:25.416 --> 28:25.833
Today is a good day.

28:26.333 --> 28:29.000
Sister...there's a letter for you.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.583
Son, have some.

28:31.083 --> 28:34.583
Soon I'll have your room too.

28:38.208 --> 28:40.041
There's a letter too.

28:40.541 --> 28:42.375
Read it out...loudly.

28:42.875 --> 28:44.083
My dear Tanu.

28:44.583 --> 28:49.000
I never imagined that I'll be sending this letter to you.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.708
But things have gone too far now.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.250
You've crossed all limits.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.125
But there's still time.

28:56.625 --> 28:59.625
If you mend your ways and apologies..

29:00.125 --> 29:03.625
..then I am ready to forgive you.

29:04.125 --> 29:05.875
Waiting for your call.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.666
Yours truly, Manu.

29:08.166 --> 29:13.083
It's from brother-in-law.

29:13.583 --> 29:15.833
Son, do you only speak like that, or do you write like that too.

29:16.333 --> 29:17.791
No, I write clearly.

29:18.291 --> 29:20.083
Then write him a letter in red.

29:20.583 --> 29:23.541
I am done respecting you.

29:24.041 --> 29:26.208
Go.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.916
Chintu, you became a lawyer today..

29:29.416 --> 29:31.125
..and you also got your first case.

29:31.625 --> 29:34.708
Come on, get your bike.

29:35.208 --> 29:38.708
I'll show you all of Batman's legends.

29:43.458 --> 29:47.708
"O Beloved.."

29:48.208 --> 29:52.000
"O Beloved...I'm bored of singing all those painful songs."

29:52.500 --> 29:56.750
"Now there's rock-n-roll playing in my heart."

29:57.250 --> 30:01.291
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

30:01.791 --> 30:05.291
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

30:11.166 --> 30:15.208
"Beloved Move on."

30:15.708 --> 30:20.000
"Move on...on...on...on.."

30:20.500 --> 30:24.958
"Move on...on...on...on.."

30:25.458 --> 30:34.208
"Why look for another stranger?"

30:34.708 --> 30:43.083
"Why look for another story?"

30:43.583 --> 30:45.916
"The heart's happy wandering around."

30:46.416 --> 30:48.291
"The heart's happy wandering around."

30:48.791 --> 30:50.375
"The heart's happy wandering around."

30:50.875 --> 30:54.916
"So why look for a place to stay."

30:55.416 --> 30:59.583
"Why look for a place to stay."

31:00.083 --> 31:04.125
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

31:04.625 --> 31:08.958
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

31:09.458 --> 31:13.500
"Move on."

31:14.000 --> 31:18.291
"Beloved Move on."

31:18.791 --> 31:22.791
"Move on...on...on...on.."

31:23.291 --> 31:27.916
"Move on...on...on...on.."

31:28.416 --> 31:31.916
"Whenever I start a new world."

31:37.625 --> 31:46.083
"I'll also find a new God."

31:46.583 --> 31:48.916
"If I don't find someone capable."

31:49.416 --> 31:50.833
"If I don't find someone capable."

31:51.333 --> 31:53.250
"If I don't find someone capable."

31:53.750 --> 31:57.916
"Then I'll be God myself."

31:58.416 --> 32:02.500
"Then I'll be God myself."

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:07.500 --> 32:12.041
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:12.541 --> 32:18.791
"O Beloved...I'm bored of singing all those painful songs."

32:19.291 --> 32:23.625
"Now there's rock-n-roll playing in my heart."

32:24.125 --> 32:28.000
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:28.500 --> 32:32.708
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:33.208 --> 32:37.416
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:37.916 --> 32:42.291
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:42.791 --> 32:46.750
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:47.250 --> 32:52.083
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

32:52.583 --> 32:56.083
"Move on."

33:02.083 --> 33:08.166
Let me introduce you to the villain of my story.

33:08.666 --> 33:12.166
Chintu, do I look okay?

33:15.041 --> 33:16.208
What happened?

33:16.708 --> 33:20.208
Don't just stand there, come on.

33:38.541 --> 33:40.750
After this we'll go get something to eat

33:41.250 --> 33:44.750
Hello

33:47.208 --> 33:49.750
The moustache looks nice on you, Awasthi

33:50.250 --> 33:53.458
You've turned quite spiritual. - Yes

33:53.958 --> 33:58.166
I took my mind of you and into God.

33:58.666 --> 33:59.458
Good

33:59.958 --> 34:02.833
You should keep yourself busy

34:03.333 --> 34:05.958
How's the doctor?

34:06.458 --> 34:09.916
How are husbands?

34:10.416 --> 34:13.458
Don't know. I'll tell you by next year

34:13.958 --> 34:14.750
Really?

34:15.250 --> 34:16.750
So you're taking the leap too

34:17.250 --> 34:18.875
Yes.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.750
Finally I found a girl I like

34:22.250 --> 34:24.458
Oh dear!

34:24.958 --> 34:29.375
So my ship sank close to the shore

34:29.875 --> 34:35.208
Now that I am back, you're leaving

34:35.708 --> 34:37.708
Well...anyway

34:38.208 --> 34:43.291
Chintu, let's go. - Yes

34:43.791 --> 34:44.625
See you brother

34:45.125 --> 34:49.208
Hey boy.. - Yes, brother?

34:49.708 --> 34:50.208
Who are you?

34:50.708 --> 34:53.375
Me... Shoulder! - Who?

34:53.875 --> 34:54.375
Shoulder

34:54.875 --> 34:56.666
You know...the breed of boys.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.583
We come into the picture when girls are very sad.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.750
Fed up of all her relations.

35:01.250 --> 35:05.500
When you shunned her, that doctor gave her his shoulder.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.458
Now when the doctor shunned her, I gave her mine.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.166
And when I do the same, you can offer her yours.

35:09.666 --> 35:12.750
I'll take your leave. Madam has places to go.

35:13.250 --> 35:16.000
Hey... - Yes brother?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.916
Stay within your limits, son.

35:19.416 --> 35:22.916
Or you'll end up hurt

35:25.875 --> 35:34.416
You think your wife will jump out of the phone if you keep staring at it?

35:34.916 --> 35:37.166
Look...shall I tell you where you went wrong?

35:37.666 --> 35:39.208
The day sister-in-law realizes..

35:39.708 --> 35:43.750
..she will come running and apologies to you.

35:44.250 --> 35:45.375
And Listen..

35:45.875 --> 35:46.916
Have some pity on poor guys like us.

35:47.416 --> 35:48.583
Talk to Komal's family.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.708
Please... Do you want me to beg?

35:51.208 --> 35:54.750
Please.. - Fine, I'll talk to them. Sit.

35:55.250 --> 35:58.583
You don't care at all

35:59.083 --> 36:01.333
Sorry Pappi. I've made you all sad.

36:01.833 --> 36:03.041
No seriously.

36:03.541 --> 36:04.750
There's a lecture at Delhi University day after tomorrow.

36:05.250 --> 36:05.708
Okay.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.333
We'll head for Chandigarh right after that.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.791
Really? - Yes.

36:09.291 --> 36:09.416
Wonderful.

36:09.916 --> 36:12.000
And you can fulfill your dream of getting married. - Of course.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.083
That's more like it.

36:13.583 --> 36:16.583
My marriage will be an example for your marriage.

36:17.083 --> 36:18.458
And just watch how it's done.

36:18.958 --> 36:20.583
You will be uncle in a year.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.833
For instance, there are two types of Arithmia.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.250
The bi-cardia and the tri-cardia.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.458
Bi-cardia, where the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute.

36:28.958 --> 36:31.291
And tri-cardia where the heart rate is..

36:31.791 --> 36:32.875
..more than 100 beats per minute.

36:33.375 --> 36:36.875
Both cause symptomatic problems like these.

36:40.750 --> 36:44.250
Its...

36:47.083 --> 36:50.375
Very rare that you see a phenomena, like this.

36:50.875 --> 36:56.916
I am sure it's also very dangerous.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.291
So..

36:59.791 --> 37:02.416
We're very lucky to have Dr. Radheshyam Agarwal..

37:02.916 --> 37:03.458
..who is an expert on this subject..

37:03.958 --> 37:05.083
..and who has agreed to speak on my behalf.

37:05.583 --> 37:09.083
Dr. Radheshyam Agarwal!

37:13.083 --> 37:16.583
Dr. Agarwal, please come.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.958
I told you about the test, remember. Now go.

37:29.458 --> 37:32.208
Get your physical done.

37:32.708 --> 37:36.208
Oh God!

37:40.666 --> 37:41.541
Any question?

37:42.041 --> 37:44.458
Sir, which is the more common phenomena?

37:44.958 --> 37:48.458
Bi-cardia or tri-cardia?

37:54.666 --> 37:55.458
Good question.

37:55.958 --> 37:58.625
You're a good question.

37:59.125 --> 38:02.625
Next.

38:19.666 --> 38:22.250
Doctor, why are there more heart-related diseases in India..

38:22.750 --> 38:26.250
..than in any other country?

38:29.041 --> 38:30.166
What's your name? - Anirudh.

38:30.666 --> 38:32.333
3rd year student. - Anirudh.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.083
Anirudh, good question.

38:34.583 --> 38:37.083
But your question hurt me.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.250
It's paining me.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.458
Excuse me, doctor. - Yes, doctor.

38:42.958 --> 38:44.791
Can you check what's happening? - Yeah, sure,

38:45.291 --> 38:47.625
Here? - Here?

38:48.125 --> 38:48.750
Doctor. Doctor, relax.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.500
His question.. - Doctor, relax.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.625
Lie down.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.833
Lie down. Doctor, relax.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.083
Doctor.

38:56.583 --> 39:03.125
Doctor, relax. Somebody call the ambulance, please.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.333
She will apology...

39:05.833 --> 39:09.333
...when she will realize.

39:14.375 --> 39:15.708
You fool...

39:16.208 --> 39:17.375
Are you crazy?

39:17.875 --> 39:19.875
What were you doing with your arms spread out?

39:20.375 --> 39:22.583
This is no place to be Shahrukh Khan.

39:23.083 --> 39:24.458
I thought.. - What did you think?

39:24.958 --> 39:26.625
That I am Manisha Koirala?

39:27.125 --> 39:29.666
Come on, Dhatto. - Coming.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.541
Shameless...good for nothing perverts.

39:33.041 --> 39:36.250
We'll miss our bus.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.208
What happened?

39:38.708 --> 39:39.833
He was standing in the middle of the pitch.

39:40.333 --> 39:41.791
I am injured now. - Are you hurt?

39:42.291 --> 39:45.791
Old fool.

39:48.333 --> 39:49.625
Hurry up. Come on.

39:50.125 --> 39:53.916
Put the stretcher in the ambulance.

39:54.416 --> 39:55.333
Pappi.

39:55.833 --> 39:57.375
Come quickly.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.625
Come on.

40:00.125 --> 40:03.250
Sir, relax. Sir..

40:03.750 --> 40:04.708
Quick quick

40:05.208 --> 40:06.375
Come on.

40:06.875 --> 40:07.583
Do you know what happened?

40:08.083 --> 40:10.416
Sir..

40:10.916 --> 40:11.541
I've been noticing that..

40:12.041 --> 40:13.875
..the Sharma family enjoys embarrassing me.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.333
Listen to me. Tanu is right here.

40:16.833 --> 40:17.541
I'll show you.

40:18.041 --> 40:19.625
What? Who?

40:20.125 --> 40:20.583
Tanu.

40:21.083 --> 40:24.583
Oh, God!

40:27.958 --> 40:29.166
Isn't that, Tanu? - Which one?

40:29.666 --> 40:31.750
That boy-cut. That's not sister-in-law Tanu.

40:32.250 --> 40:32.916
Aren't you wearing your glasses?

40:33.416 --> 40:35.458
Pappi, that's Tannu. - She isn't.

40:35.958 --> 40:40.000
What if she is? - And what if she isn't?

40:40.500 --> 40:44.041
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. - Quiet.

40:44.541 --> 40:45.291
How can she be Sister-in-law?

40:45.791 --> 40:49.250
Did she go back to college?

40:49.750 --> 40:53.250
Lovers like you cause half the pollution in Delhi.

41:12.166 --> 41:14.416
How can you say she's sister-in-law Tanu?

41:14.916 --> 41:16.583
That's someone else.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.541
She isn't?

41:19.041 --> 41:22.125
And will you follow anyone who looks like her?

41:22.625 --> 41:23.791
Go on.

41:24.291 --> 41:25.958
Come on, let's go to ISBT.

41:26.458 --> 41:29.791
I see no hope, nor a face.

41:30.291 --> 41:31.958
Death is inevitable.

41:32.458 --> 41:33.791
But why can't sleep at nights.

41:34.291 --> 41:40.541
Very impressive Chintu!

41:41.041 --> 41:41.833
Who's it now?

41:42.333 --> 41:44.750
My soul mate.

41:45.250 --> 41:46.375
Hello. - Payal.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.708
Where are you? - Kanpur.

41:49.208 --> 41:53.750
Listen...today is the function for the kid.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.041
Everyone's so happy.

41:55.541 --> 41:57.000
That's a good thing.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.750
Do you know who I met today?

41:59.250 --> 41:59.833
Awasthi.

42:00.333 --> 42:00.791
Raja.

42:01.291 --> 42:02.916
He's grown a moustache now.

42:03.416 --> 42:04.208
He looks hot.

42:04.708 --> 42:06.375
Listen Tanu.

42:06.875 --> 42:08.666
Don't get yourself in these hassles.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.083
I am telling you because I already am in one.

42:10.583 --> 42:12.458
Believe me, it's no use. You feel really guilty.

42:12.958 --> 42:14.375
Guilty? Why?

42:14.875 --> 42:16.541
Isn't this Jassi's kid?

42:17.041 --> 42:19.791
Yes...it's not.

42:20.291 --> 42:22.750
I'll tell you in detail when we meet.

42:23.250 --> 42:26.250
Tanu, come here soon. Or else I'll die of guilt.

42:26.750 --> 42:28.791
You've made this really exciting.

42:29.291 --> 42:30.291
She's Mr. Trivedi's daughter, isn't she?

42:30.791 --> 42:31.375
Yes.

42:31.875 --> 42:33.750
So why are you taking her around?

42:34.250 --> 42:36.875
She's married. - Are you her father-in-law?

42:37.375 --> 42:40.875
Mind your own business.

42:44.916 --> 42:48.416
Your moustache is beautiful.

42:55.375 --> 42:59.208
You know, perverts love a book called Lolita.

42:59.708 --> 43:01.166
Have you read it?

43:01.666 --> 43:06.750
You see...a middle-aged man keeps staring at a little girl.

43:07.250 --> 43:10.416
She wasn't even born when you completed your graduation.

43:10.916 --> 43:13.250
Look, I'll lodge a complaint with the police.

43:13.750 --> 43:14.958
There are 1500 students here.

43:15.458 --> 43:17.833
If they all slap you..

43:18.333 --> 43:21.125
Oh, God. - Get out before she gets here.

43:21.625 --> 43:22.833
Oh, God.

43:23.333 --> 43:26.833
Don't look. Don't look.

43:30.416 --> 43:31.750
Hey come come

43:32.250 --> 43:34.333
This is a DTC bus. Anyone can board it.

43:34.833 --> 43:36.208
Come on. - Pahad Ganj bus depot.

43:36.708 --> 43:38.458
Come on.

43:38.958 --> 43:41.208
Keep your bag on your lap.

43:41.708 --> 43:44.291
Shut up.

43:44.791 --> 43:50.458
If these people find out we're following that girl..

43:50.958 --> 43:54.625
They will beat us black and blue.

43:55.125 --> 43:55.958
Whistle?

43:56.458 --> 43:57.375
You don't know what's a whistle?

43:57.875 --> 44:00.291
Remember those toy dolls we used to play with when we were kids.

44:00.791 --> 44:02.750
And if you pressed that doll, it would..

44:03.250 --> 44:04.083
Ticket?

44:04.583 --> 44:06.375
Staff. - What staff?

44:06.875 --> 44:08.333
Delhi University, don't you see?

44:08.833 --> 44:09.958
This is the DTC bus...

44:10.458 --> 44:12.750
No concession to any staff.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.916
How much? - 10.

44:15.416 --> 44:17.291
And how much for your windscreen?

44:17.791 --> 44:19.291
You fool, one brick..

44:19.791 --> 44:22.791
..and you'll lose 10,000 instead of 10.

44:23.291 --> 44:24.333
Ticket?

44:24.833 --> 44:30.541
Brother...if this girl finds out we're following her..

44:31.041 --> 44:34.250
..then she will beat us to a pulp.

44:34.750 --> 44:35.708
You do understand that don't you?

44:36.208 --> 44:38.666
This one...our..

44:39.166 --> 44:41.375
It's called something more crude in Punjabi.

44:41.875 --> 44:42.833
I..

44:43.333 --> 44:45.041
Ticket.

44:45.541 --> 44:49.041
Staff!

44:56.250 --> 44:59.750
Brother, you didn't eat your almonds

45:05.125 --> 45:08.625
I'll need money today.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.250
Walk straight. Straight..

45:19.750 --> 45:21.333
Don't look.

45:21.833 --> 45:22.375
What are you doing?

45:22.875 --> 45:24.583
We can pay you only 200

45:25.083 --> 45:26.833
Don't look at her.

45:27.333 --> 45:28.791
Okay how about 250?

45:29.291 --> 45:32.791
How much is that for?

45:40.625 --> 45:41.791
Look at this one

45:42.291 --> 45:46.500
Sit carefully.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.958
Keep your knees to yourself.

45:50.458 --> 45:52.541
Sit carefully.

45:53.041 --> 45:56.458
Don't look at her. - How's your stomach?

45:56.958 --> 45:58.875
What? - How's your stomach?

45:59.375 --> 46:00.416
I kicked you the other day, remember.

46:00.916 --> 46:02.333
Yes, it's fine.

46:02.833 --> 46:06.750
Thank you.

46:07.250 --> 46:11.125
Mister, why do I feel like you're following me?

46:11.625 --> 46:15.875
No, it's not that.

46:16.375 --> 46:18.833
Just tell me who you're following. Me or her?

46:19.333 --> 46:21.458
We've a bet going.

46:21.958 --> 46:23.041
No, it's not what you think.

46:23.541 --> 46:24.791
Stop the rickshaw.

46:25.291 --> 46:26.416
Stop. Stop.

46:26.916 --> 46:29.125
Loveboy. You say you're not following me.

46:29.625 --> 46:31.541
Get down. - Listen to me.

46:32.041 --> 46:34.791
You're mistaken. I am not following you.

46:35.291 --> 46:38.541
You look like my wife. You look like my wife.

46:39.041 --> 46:39.625
Listen to me..

46:40.125 --> 46:41.916
Just listen to me..

46:42.416 --> 46:43.208
I am a doctor.

46:43.708 --> 46:44.875
Will you listen to me?

46:45.375 --> 46:48.333
My wife looks.. Look..

46:48.833 --> 46:50.875
You look like my wife.

46:51.375 --> 46:53.541
Wait..

46:54.041 --> 46:57.833
Look. Take a look.

46:58.333 --> 47:00.958
Your wife does look like me.

47:01.458 --> 47:03.125
Normally we see this in films.

47:03.625 --> 47:05.541
I never imagined I could have a lookalike.

47:06.041 --> 47:07.583
She does look a bit like her.

47:08.083 --> 47:09.458
But is she dead?

47:09.958 --> 47:11.916
No...

47:12.416 --> 47:15.958
Did she run away? - No..

47:16.458 --> 47:17.208
She left me.

47:17.708 --> 47:23.166
We're getting divorced. - Oh..

47:23.666 --> 47:24.583
That's sad.

47:25.083 --> 47:26.666
But, mister, the reality is..

47:27.166 --> 47:28.875
Your wife looks just like me..

47:29.375 --> 47:30.208
..but I am not your wife.

47:30.708 --> 47:31.583
My name is Kumari Kusum Sangwan..

47:32.083 --> 47:32.666
..and this is my friend Pinky.

47:33.166 --> 47:34.666
We study at Ramjas College, Delhi University.

47:35.166 --> 47:37.166
I got admission through sport's quota. I am a national level athlete.

47:37.666 --> 47:38.833
District Jhajjar, 12 45 07.

47:39.333 --> 47:42.791
And I won't give my phone number.

47:43.291 --> 47:45.166
No, I..

47:45.666 --> 47:49.791
I thought...

47:50.291 --> 47:53.208
Never mind, I am sorry.

47:53.708 --> 47:56.583
Mister... - I want to say sorry too.

47:57.083 --> 47:59.000
I misunderstood you.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.916
I can't make you happy like your wife.

48:02.416 --> 48:03.333
But if you ever want to taste home-made food..

48:03.833 --> 48:04.750
..you can come see me.

48:05.250 --> 48:09.791
I bring lunch from home.

48:10.291 --> 48:12.125
Keep the lights on.

48:12.625 --> 48:13.875
I'm applying medicine.

48:14.375 --> 48:18.041
My knee's cracked-up. Listen, its creaking.

48:18.541 --> 48:20.000
Switch it on.

48:20.500 --> 48:21.541
You silly man!

48:22.041 --> 48:24.625
This is the first time I got beaten up by a girl.

48:25.125 --> 48:28.625
My entire personality is completely shattered.

48:35.625 --> 48:36.250
Stop.

48:36.750 --> 48:37.833
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

48:38.333 --> 48:39.416
Stop. Stop. Stop.

48:39.916 --> 48:41.708
Turn around

48:42.208 --> 48:43.250
What? What? What? What?

48:43.750 --> 48:45.625
What? What are you thinking?

48:46.125 --> 48:48.625
No. Not at all.

48:49.125 --> 48:49.458
No.

48:49.958 --> 48:51.416
This is called extra-marital affair.

48:51.916 --> 48:52.916
Illicit relation.

48:53.416 --> 48:57.875
Illegal affairs

48:58.375 --> 49:00.041
This is where it all begins.

49:00.541 --> 49:01.916
No, no, don't laugh.

49:02.416 --> 49:04.250
You'll remember what I said when you're in a jam.

49:04.750 --> 49:06.416
No, don't to the dark path.

49:06.916 --> 49:10.416
Understand? Don't.

49:12.916 --> 49:15.958
This is where it all begins.

49:16.458 --> 49:19.208
Look.. You're head over heels for that child.

49:19.708 --> 49:24.166
She's dancing around because she passed.

49:24.666 --> 49:26.250
Who is it? - Mr. Sharma.

49:26.750 --> 49:29.041
Here she comes.

49:29.541 --> 49:31.833
I passed.

49:32.333 --> 49:33.708
I had no hope, but I passed.

49:34.208 --> 49:35.250
This calls for a party.

49:35.750 --> 49:38.583
Party?

49:39.083 --> 49:41.833
Wow, we're going boating.

49:42.333 --> 49:45.333
Mister...you should pedal too.

49:45.833 --> 49:48.208
How am I supposed to when you have broken my legs?

49:48.708 --> 49:49.416
What?

49:49.916 --> 49:53.375
There's a handle. I'll pedal using this.

49:53.875 --> 49:56.916
It's a wonderful ambiance, Mr. Sharma. - Right.

49:57.416 --> 49:59.916
Sing a song for me.

50:00.416 --> 50:02.500
I can't sing. - Everyone can sing.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.833
I can't. - Shall I?

50:05.333 --> 50:08.833
Of course. - I learnt it on BBC radio.

50:12.416 --> 50:16.458
"I might be sentimental."

50:16.958 --> 50:21.041
"But don't get so judgmental."

50:21.541 --> 50:25.125
"So what I am an old-school girl?

50:25.625 --> 50:27.708
Am I singing in accent? - Haryanvi?

50:28.208 --> 50:31.708
No, American. - No, not at all.

50:35.416 --> 50:40.250
"I might be sentimental."

50:40.750 --> 50:45.000
"But don't get so judgmental."

50:45.500 --> 50:49.083
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

50:49.583 --> 50:51.166
"I am an old-school girl."

50:51.666 --> 50:55.125
"I am an old-school girl."

50:55.625 --> 51:00.458
"I might be sentimental."

51:00.958 --> 51:05.166
"But don't get so judgmental."

51:05.666 --> 51:09.250
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

51:09.750 --> 51:11.375
"I am an old-school girl."

51:11.875 --> 51:15.375
"I am an old-school girl."

51:35.958 --> 51:40.958
"Darling though we're from different time-zones."

51:41.458 --> 51:46.458
"I still can call you any time on your telephone."

51:46.958 --> 51:52.541
"But I really long... for your handwritten letters."

51:53.041 --> 51:57.083
"You.. baby those days are gone."

51:57.583 --> 52:01.833
"I love the smell of your palm and your ink."

52:02.333 --> 52:07.041
"One letter from you just makes me love your everything."

52:07.541 --> 52:10.250
"All sweet nothings you don't write..

52:10.750 --> 52:12.083
"..between your lines."

52:12.583 --> 52:16.416
"My heart can hear them every single time."

52:16.916 --> 52:21.333
"I might be sentimental."

52:21.833 --> 52:26.041
"But don't get so judgmental."

52:26.541 --> 52:30.166
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

52:30.666 --> 52:32.291
"I am an old-school girl."

52:32.791 --> 52:36.291
"I am an old-school girl."

52:56.833 --> 53:02.625
"I'll fight with the world if it comes to that."

53:03.125 --> 53:07.541
"Be a big girl to prove I am right."

53:08.041 --> 53:13.166
"But every time you say goodbye."

53:13.666 --> 53:14.500
"I swear to God.."

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
"I cry! I cry! I cry!"

53:17.500 --> 53:20.833
"I cry! I cry! Boy, I cry!"

53:21.333 --> 53:23.208
"I cry! I cry!"

53:23.708 --> 53:25.125
"Every time you say goodbye."

53:25.625 --> 53:26.041
"I swear to God.."

53:26.541 --> 53:28.375
"I cry!

53:28.875 --> 53:30.958
"I might be sentimental."

53:31.458 --> 53:33.583
"But don't get so judgmental."

53:34.083 --> 53:36.958
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

53:37.458 --> 53:42.250
"I might be sentimental."

53:42.750 --> 53:46.208
"But don't get so judgmental."

53:46.708 --> 53:49.458
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

53:49.958 --> 53:52.375
"So what if I am an old-school girl."

53:52.875 --> 53:57.416
"I am an old-school girl."

53:57.916 --> 53:59.041
Mister, two glasses of juice.

53:59.541 --> 53:59.958
Mr. Sharma.. - Orange?

54:00.458 --> 54:01.458
Orange? - Yes.

54:01.958 --> 54:03.250
Yes, orange juice.

54:03.750 --> 54:07.250
I am scared of dogs myself.

54:09.125 --> 54:10.875
Mr. Sharma, until now boys have been..

54:11.375 --> 54:13.791
..either my brothers or competition.

54:14.291 --> 54:19.291
I never had any other kind of relation with them.

54:19.791 --> 54:22.375
I have lot of responsibility on me.

54:22.875 --> 54:24.458
People will say..

54:24.958 --> 54:27.208
Dhatto went to Delhi to be famous..

54:27.708 --> 54:29.875
..but she fell in love instead.

54:30.375 --> 54:31.750
You see...no other girl will ever be allowed..

54:32.250 --> 54:35.208
..to leave Jhajjar again.

54:35.708 --> 54:38.250
My sister-in-law has someone in mind for me.

54:38.750 --> 54:41.291
You were someone's husband.

54:41.791 --> 54:45.750
Let's end this right here.

54:46.250 --> 54:47.833
When it has no future..

54:48.333 --> 54:52.125
..there's no point in going through all the trouble.

54:52.625 --> 54:54.000
Like they say..

54:54.500 --> 54:58.250
Precaution is better than cure.

54:58.750 --> 55:03.083
You see, I don't know myself what's happening and why.

55:03.583 --> 55:06.166
But I.. - See you, Mr. Sharma.

55:06.666 --> 55:08.666
Keep them safe.

55:09.166 --> 55:12.583
I heard gold's getting expensive.

55:13.083 --> 55:18.083
"Every time you say goodbye."

55:18.583 --> 55:19.500
"I swear to God.."

55:20.000 --> 55:21.750
"I cry! I cry! I cry!"

55:22.250 --> 55:25.958
"I cry! I cry! Boy, I cry!"

55:26.458 --> 55:29.958
"I cry!"

55:45.416 --> 55:47.541
For you.

55:48.041 --> 55:51.541
Here.

55:59.666 --> 56:01.041
She sent a divorce letter.

56:01.541 --> 56:03.625
Manu, I'll find someone better.

56:04.125 --> 56:07.625
It's not too late for you to get married again.

56:15.125 --> 56:18.500
Hello. Is that Manoj Sharma speaking?

56:19.000 --> 56:19.166
Yes, speaking.

56:19.666 --> 56:23.333
This is Tanuja's Lawyer, advocate Arun Kumar Singh.

56:23.833 --> 56:26.458
I am sure you received the notice.

56:26.958 --> 56:27.125
Yes.

56:27.625 --> 56:30.458
Well, I was thinking about giving you another piece of news.

56:30.958 --> 56:34.250
At your wedding, there was another horse along with yours.

56:34.750 --> 56:36.333
So that horse is back.

56:36.833 --> 56:40.458
You must have heard about Raja Awasthi.

56:40.958 --> 56:41.791
Yes, so don't forget.

56:42.291 --> 56:43.708
So, I'm hanging up.

56:44.208 --> 56:47.375
Mr. Trivedi. Hold on.

56:47.875 --> 56:52.750
Now listen to him.

56:53.250 --> 56:56.750
Pappi.

57:02.208 --> 57:03.833
Let's go ask him.

57:04.333 --> 57:06.916
Him? He's stealing electricity.

57:07.416 --> 57:09.291
Sir. - Sir?

57:09.791 --> 57:11.458
Sir, what's Om Prakash Sangwan's address?

57:11.958 --> 57:14.916
Pocket B, 411/2...that one..

57:15.416 --> 57:17.666
Strange, he knows it by-heart.

57:18.166 --> 57:19.166
Yes, I am Om Prakash Sangwan.

57:19.666 --> 57:20.541
Oh God..

57:21.041 --> 57:24.541
What do you want? - Let's go. Come on.

57:29.833 --> 57:33.333
Uncle.

57:34.833 --> 57:36.875
Uncle, here's your 6 months' rent.

57:37.375 --> 57:39.333
Uncle, last night I was in tears..

57:39.833 --> 57:40.958
..while thinking about you.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.375
I realized how I've wronged you.

57:43.875 --> 57:45.166
In the morning, I went straight to the bank.

57:45.666 --> 57:46.750
Took money from my FD..

57:47.250 --> 57:48.583
..and came straight to you with the money.

57:49.083 --> 57:51.375
Keep the money.

57:51.875 --> 57:53.333
Uncle, take my advice..

57:53.833 --> 57:55.916
..and put some money away in a FD.

57:56.416 --> 57:57.375
You don't have a son.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.333
All you have is a daughter, who is out of control.

57:59.833 --> 58:01.208
If you save some money..

58:01.708 --> 58:06.041
..at least you won't have to wander around.

58:06.541 --> 58:08.625
What insolence is this? - Exactly.

58:09.125 --> 58:12.416
If you had been strict with your daughter at the right time..

58:12.916 --> 58:15.458
..then she wouldn't have been in this mess.

58:15.958 --> 58:18.625
Gunjan Talkies is screening Aashiqui 2, matinee show.

58:19.125 --> 58:20.333
Along with Raja Awasthi.

58:20.833 --> 58:24.833
Songs are being sung...bangles are tinkling.

58:25.333 --> 58:30.125
"Are you listening.."

58:30.625 --> 58:34.125
"I am crying.."

58:50.708 --> 58:54.750
Look, Manu. I am not against love marriage at all.

58:55.250 --> 58:56.958
I had a love marriage too. - I see.

58:57.458 --> 58:58.708
And on top of it, it was inter-caste.

58:59.208 --> 59:00.541
I also have a small daughter.

59:01.041 --> 59:01.666
Great.

59:02.166 --> 59:04.666
But there is a problem.

59:05.166 --> 59:07.416
But I can't understand what the problem is.

59:07.916 --> 59:11.416
Normally there are problems in a love marriage.

59:14.916 --> 59:17.208
But...Manu, I would still say that..

59:17.708 --> 59:22.041
..you should talk to Kusum once.

59:22.541 --> 59:24.708
You see...if my sister's willing..

59:25.208 --> 59:26.916
..that doesn't mean we don't have a problem.

59:27.416 --> 59:28.166
There's still a problem.

59:28.666 --> 59:32.166
But only then can I tell you what the problem is.

59:39.625 --> 59:43.416
Manu, please talk to Kusum.

59:43.916 --> 59:47.041
I'll be right back.

59:47.541 --> 59:51.041
Keep the door open.

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:12.291
This isn't the first time I've fallen in love, Kusum.

01:00:12.791 --> 01:00:14.625
I was in love with someone before.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:17.666
I've worn my wedding attire before, ridden the horse before..

01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:20.291
..and taken the nuptial rounds with someone before.

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:23.125
I've laughed with someone cried behind someone's back.

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:25.875
I lost trying to build a home.

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:28.291
And I lost so badly..

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:32.083
..that I strongly detest this husband-wife relation.

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:33.250
But after I met you..

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:39.750
..I felt like I had the courage to repeat this mistake again.

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.291
If someone who's scared of love..

01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:44.666
..falls in love again, then it must be something special.

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:47.375
All I would like to say is..

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:50.875
I will love you, and keep you happy.

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:53.208
Support you in joy and sorrows.

01:00:53.708 --> 01:00:55.666
And every time you win a competition, Tanu..

01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:59.666
Kusum.

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:04.291
See...I told you this has happened before.

01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:06.541
I've said these things before.

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:10.541
But you happened to me for the first time.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.166
Brother, there's an outbreak of cholera in Delhi.

01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:19.000
I see.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.708
So be careful with the fritters.

01:01:22.208 --> 01:01:24.333
And I told you... there will be a problem.

01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:26.708
There's always a problem in love marriages.

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:28.041
See, there's a problem.

01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:29.541
What?

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:32.375
Well, my missus says that he's a divorcee..

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:36.000
Which you already told me.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.666
But I don't have an objection, but my wife does.

01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:41.083
And secondly...

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:44.791
She's already chosen Kusum..

01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:48.541
..for one of her distant brother.

01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:49.916
He belongs from your side.

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:53.041
UP. Take a look.

01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:57.041
You might have seen him before.

01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:06.958
What's going on here?

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:09.083
Stop this.

01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:12.291
Manu Sharma, trying to be Shahrukh Khan, huh!

01:02:12.791 --> 01:02:14.291
"This has happened before."

01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:15.750
"This has happened before."

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.041
I'll tell you what happened before.

01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:20.583
He tried to snatch your wife before.

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:23.583
And you left this poor boy hanging.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:25.458
Last time he was busy giving justification..

01:02:25.958 --> 01:02:27.625
..but this time he'll shoot first and talk later.

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:30.083
No. Why give any justification.

01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:32.250
He'll shoot first and get going.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.666
What justification?

01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:35.791
Just shoot.

01:02:36.291 --> 01:02:37.333
Why justification?

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:39.291
Pappi, what are you saying? - Pappi?

01:02:39.791 --> 01:02:42.375
He'll be taking your pappi (kiss) now.

01:02:42.875 --> 01:02:46.541
She's supposed to be marrying him.

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:50.166
I am feeling uneasy.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:54.166
Pappi, brother!

01:03:06.875 --> 01:03:09.458
You see, women are like blending machine..

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:10.916
..and men are the fruit.

01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:12.458
And for the last two weeks..

01:03:12.958 --> 01:03:14.416
..we were hovering around this machine.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:18.708
One wrong move, and..

01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:19.791
And that Raja Awashti.

01:03:20.291 --> 01:03:23.708
He would've rained bullets on us.

01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.083
I saved you.

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:27.166
Your father came to us with the proposal.

01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:29.708
Manu had no dearth of marriage proposals. - Who is she yelling at in the morning?

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.416
There are plenty of them out there.

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:34.916
What's wrong, aunty?

01:03:35.416 --> 01:03:36.416
We had to get you two married..

01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:39.458
..because he was in love with you.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:41.625
It's the machine! The machine.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:43.041
You've made a mess of things.

01:03:43.541 --> 01:03:45.166
Mr. Sharma.. - This is my new coat.

01:03:45.666 --> 01:03:47.333
I had warned you that she isn't the right girl.

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:51.333
But you let her father cloud your judgment.

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:53.625
She couldn't even abide by the marriage for 4 years. - Who?

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:56.041
And look at that haircut she's got.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.458
Look at those fangs.

01:03:58.958 --> 01:04:02.458
What are you blabbering? - Where are you going?

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.083
Where's Chintu?

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:13.208
At the next shop.

01:04:13.708 --> 01:04:17.208
Add some small pieces catechu.

01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:21.250
Why did you tell papa about me and Raja?

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:24.750
I even told your husband. - Why?

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:26.708
Why?

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:28.458
Why did Ranjha die?

01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:30.583
Why did Farhad die?

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.125
Why did Romeo stab himself?

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:37.000
And why do millions of girls slit their veins?

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.166
Love.

01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:40.916
Tanu, I was in love with you.

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:42.458
You're crazy.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:46.750
I am married. - That's just your marital status.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.416
But you're a still a bachelor at heart.

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:52.333
And...I already sent the divorce letter to your husband.

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:53.666
What?

01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:56.416
When? - I sent it yesterday, by Blue Dart.

01:04:56.916 --> 01:04:58.458
I'm sure he's already received it.

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:01.208
It's only the seven nuptial rounds, Tanu.

01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:04.291
You won't mind taking them again.

01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:07.166
I can give my life for you.

01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:09.208
Hey...don't touch me.

01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:10.916
This is the problem.

01:05:11.416 --> 01:05:13.625
One smile...and you think the girl's crazy about you.

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:15.875
Was I just a bike and one liter of petrol for you?

01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:18.333
Only good for taking you to Raja Awasthi.

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:19.541
I warned you.

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.041
It takes 2 hours to get to Kanpur from Lucknow.

01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:24.666
Raja.. - And you!

01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:27.041
You husband-wife have made my life bad.

01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:29.208
Quietly get on the bike and come with me.

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:30.333
And you..

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.750
You're just a shrimp, understand.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:37.458
You..

01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.458
Don't just insult me and leave, Raja Awasthi.

01:05:40.958 --> 01:05:41.666
Finish me. - Let go.

01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:44.166
Just finish me for good. I am a serpent.

01:05:44.666 --> 01:05:46.458
I'll make your life miserable.

01:05:46.958 --> 01:05:47.458
Wait...

01:05:47.958 --> 01:05:52.375
I will kill you. - So kill me.

01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:53.416
Stop.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.875
He will shoot you.

01:05:56.375 --> 01:05:58.958
I won't spare you.

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:02.958
Make another betel leaf.

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.458
Your courage has filled me with zest.

01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:11.083
You aren't over your first wife yet..

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:13.375
..and already locking horns with the bull.

01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:15.208
Bull?

01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:16.750
I have a brother.

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:18.875
Not Omi, another one.

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.666
When he was just 5, he tried to wrestle a bull.

01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:23.083
Got his bones broken.

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:25.333
After he got better, he tried to wrestle it again.

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:27.083
And broke his bones again.

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:28.458
When he got better again..

01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:31.958
..the fool tried to lock horns with it again.

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:35.291
People say my brother is crazy.

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:39.250
But I like my brother.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:42.000
And you too.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.958
Mr. Sharma, I've decided..

01:06:45.458 --> 01:06:47.000
..that I'm going to take the bull by its horns.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.000
We'll see what happens.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:55.458
You do love me, don't you?

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:59.458
No, I'll believe it when you say it convincingly.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.000
'Say it convincingly, or I'm getting out of here.'

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:30.166
Yes, I do.

01:07:30.666 --> 01:07:33.166
Great, then let's go to Jhajjar.

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:35.083
Let's go deal with my family.

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:40.208
Don't be afraid if they beat you up.

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:43.750
If you're doing a good deed, then don't forget me.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.666
Komal's getting married in 3 days.

01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:46.750
Let's go to Chandigarh.

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.000
Pappi, if it's an emergency..

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.125
..then we'll deal with your problem first.

01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:53.875
What now? Pack your bags.

01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:57.875
Let's go to ISBT. Catch the bus to Punjab.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:01.583
Yes.

01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:03.000
Are you crazy?

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.250
You think I'm going to booze during daytime.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.333
Don't you see I am with a lady?

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.791
Sorry!

01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:11.583
What happened? Why are you getting so furious?

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:13.833
You see, Tanu, your doctor husband..

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:15.625
..is just bad news.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.707
And he's back in my life.

01:08:18.207 --> 01:08:20.791
And this time...I won't let him get the best of me.

01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:23.041
I will shoot him.

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:26.125
Why are you abusing him? Tell me what happened.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:28.416
Four years..

01:08:28.916 --> 01:08:30.750
It took me four years to find this girl.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.541
I didn't talk or meet her, just said yes to marrying her.

01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:36.250
Why?

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.625
Because...

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:39.582
She looked like you.

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.625
I thought if not you, then maybe someone like you.

01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:45.207
But your husband can't endure that either.

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:48.000
He wants the original as well as the duplicate.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.375
What are you saying? I don't understand.

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:51.500
What do you mean?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.375
I mean he's been getting cozy with my fiance, in Delhi.

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:57.250
Who?

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:58.625
Manu? - Yes.

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.416
Who told you? - My sister.

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:02.875
But you don't have a sister. - She's a distant cousin. You don't know her.

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:04.625
Where does she live? - Delhi.

01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:06.291
Where in Delhi?

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:07.000
Uttam Vihar.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.582
But Manu lives in Mayur Vihar.

01:09:09.082 --> 01:09:10.207
Maybe they met someplace else, I don't know.

01:09:10.707 --> 01:09:11.625
He's in love with your sister.

01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:13.541
Not my sister, her sister-in-law.

01:09:14.041 --> 01:09:15.541
But you said he's been going around with your sister.

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:17.250
Hey Tanuja Trivedi.

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:18.916
Are you a RAW agent?

01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:20.707
Just try to understand what I am saying.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:23.166
Your husband's in love again.

01:09:23.666 --> 01:09:24.457
He's betrayed you.

01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:26.416
He's given you the finger, and getting married again.

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:30.416
And all this is ruining my life.

01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:37.707
He cannot show me the finger.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:38.875
What could be better than..

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:42.041
..a man settling down at the age of 40.

01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:43.666
Shut up!

01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:44.957
Shut up!

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:48.957
Don't you see we're talking here?

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:54.082
He cannot show me the finger.

01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:55.250
He's a small potato.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:58.250
I don't care if he's a potato or apple.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.083
Either you return my fiance..

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.333
..or you come back in my life.

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:04.666
I am a simple contractor.

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.125
I don't have much brain.

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:09.333
But I do know one needs cement to join bricks.

01:10:09.833 --> 01:10:14.250
I don't care if its JK cement or Ambuja cement.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:18.250
But this should happen at all cost, that's all.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:33.250
Mister, will you take us to Sector 16?

01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.458
Here.

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:45.416
Manu's gone, daughter-in-law.

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:47.125
What do you want now?

01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:48.416
Didn't you feel ashamed..

01:10:48.916 --> 01:10:49.833
..when you sent him to the mental asylum?

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.291
I don't need him.

01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:54.000
In fact he needs my permission. I am still his legal wife.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.083
I can make all of you rot in jail.

01:10:57.583 --> 01:10:59.000
That's all there's left for you to do.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.000
You have done everything else.

01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:14.166
So this is where Jassi lives now? - Yes.

01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:16.041
Stay back.

01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:17.208
Why?

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.208
No need to hide, let's go inside.

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:22.458
We're not here on a holiday.

01:11:22.958 --> 01:11:24.708
We're here to elope with the girl.

01:11:25.208 --> 01:11:27.041
Komal is Jassi's cousin.

01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:28.833
If these Sardar's find out..

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:30.583
..they will abuse me to death.

01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:32.333
You.. why you..

01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:33.625
What rubbish.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:37.041
Jassi's my friend. I'll talk to him. - Don't...No.

01:11:37.541 --> 01:11:38.416
Now it's too late.

01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:41.500
You already missed the deadline.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:42.791
Datto.

01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:44.583
If you're caught eloping with the girl..

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:47.750
..they will beat you up terribly.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:49.666
Strangely I have faith in you.

01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:51.541
You can do this.

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.250
You must tell her once..

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.666
..that Pappi's here for you. - Right.

01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:57.875
Well then...do you have a picture of her on your mobile?

01:11:58.375 --> 01:11:58.708
I do.

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:00.125
You see, everyone knows us.

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:01.458
If we go inside, they will never leave us alone.

01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:03.875
You go inside and tell her.. - I get it.

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:05.666
Komal...your Pappi's here.

01:12:06.166 --> 01:12:06.958
No need to worry.

01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:10.416
He'll jump over this wall of wealth and take you away.

01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:12.375
See... See that.

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:14.125
That's a city girl.

01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:16.333
But they will recognize her too.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.583
She's Tanu, right.

01:12:20.083 --> 01:12:22.833
She's Datto.

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:25.875
Yes, but they will think she's Tanu.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:31.791
She is Datto, so everyone will think she's Datto.

01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:34.458
Tanu..

01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:38.458
Ohhh...they will think she's Tanu.

01:12:50.291 --> 01:12:51.666
Datto...

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:55.666
Please wear the Turban.

01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:08.291
Please wear the Turban.

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:13.541
Datto... walk carefully.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:25.791
Sister, have you seen this girl around?

01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:30.875
Sister, have you seen this girl around?

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:33.791
Tanu!

01:13:34.291 --> 01:13:37.791
Tanu!

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.666
Manu.

01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:46.541
Jassi. - Mannu, my buddy. What are you doing here?

01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:49.125
How are you?

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.750
Everyone has changed in 4 years.

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:54.666
You guys were crazy back then, and you still are.

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:58.666
Why are you doing this?

01:14:10.916 --> 01:14:13.125
What...what are you doing?

01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:14.375
Sister-in-law Tanu.

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:17.083
Aren't you ashamed?

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:18.083
Why would I be ashamed?

01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:20.833
Pappi is going crazy for you.

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:22.416
And you want to know why you should be ashamed.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.875
Pappi's here too. - He's here for you.

01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:25.833
Pack your bags.

01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:29.833
He's waiting outside by the rickshaw. Hurry up.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:33.833
For me?

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:40.625
Tanu. Hello.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:52.750
Hi.

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:56.791
This frock doesn't match with your turban and beard.

01:14:57.291 --> 01:14:57.958
It's all okay.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:00.166
Komal's would-be husband is from Gujarat.

01:15:00.666 --> 01:15:01.708
Get it. That's why..

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:05.083
So you're going to do the 'Dandiya'. - Of course.

01:15:05.583 --> 01:15:06.333
We'll do the 'Dandiya'.

01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:08.416
And not just me, you will too.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:09.500
Not me. Come on. - No, not me.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.291
Oh, come on.

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:13.458
I don't want to. - Oh, Come on. - Jassi, listen to me.

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:14.875
Hold on. - Hello.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:16.333
Hand me the mic.

01:15:16.833 --> 01:15:19.333
Listen up everyone.

01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:22.333
My best friend Manu..

01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:25.041
..has returned from London's mental asylum.

01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:26.541
And I am really happy.

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:27.666
Very happy.

01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:32.458
I've a humble request, please dance.

01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:35.208
And I swear, those who don't dance..

01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:40.375
..tomorrow morning your mother will die.

01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:42.250
Come on.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:43.833
There's nothing I want to tell you.

01:15:44.333 --> 01:15:45.583
I don't love you.

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.583
How long are you going to lie to yourself?

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:49.208
That's the limit.

01:15:49.708 --> 01:15:50.916
I am not lying to you.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:52.958
You're just a good friend, Pappi.

01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:55.166
You know.. Just like whatsapp friend.

01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:57.208
Whatsapp friend?

01:15:57.708 --> 01:15:59.541
Then what was all that LOLs for?

01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:01.333
LOL at 3 am...

01:16:01.833 --> 01:16:03.458
Those big LOLs for every small jokes.

01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:05.541
What was all that?

01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:07.333
Listen...I took that overcrowded..

01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:08.625
..Punjab Roadway's bus to get here.

01:16:09.125 --> 01:16:10.750
And you're refusing me.

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:12.166
You...

01:16:12.666 --> 01:16:15.083
You've lost your mind.

01:16:15.583 --> 01:16:16.166
Listen.

01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:19.625
Tanu, I couldn't conceive.

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:21.083
My family was bothering me.

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:22.416
Why aren't you getting pregnant? When will you bear a child?

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:23.541
When? How?

01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:24.666
They really got on my nerves.

01:16:25.166 --> 01:16:27.083
We met all the doctors, got all the tests done.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.458
And then I found out..

01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:30.666
..that Jassi was the one.

01:16:31.166 --> 01:16:32.625
See...Jassi was infertile.

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:34.416
Be a man. Be a man. - Listen to me.

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:35.291
Drink it. - Come on.

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:39.291
It's important. - Drink it. What are you doing?

01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:51.791
That was neat.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.458
Jassi...listen.

01:16:55.958 --> 01:17:01.041
Jassi, I am getting married again.

01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:04.875
You manned up in a single drink. - Yes.

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:08.041
You cannot betray me. - What betrayal?

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:10.791
Did I ever say that I love you? Never!

01:17:11.291 --> 01:17:14.083
That's only because you're shy. - Shy my foot.

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:15.541
I don't love you.

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:17.458
And anyway, the wedding's day after tomorrow..

01:17:17.958 --> 01:17:18.416
..and I am really happy.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:21.125
You'll have to get married over my dead body, believe me!

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:24.625
Fine with me, just stop following me.

01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:28.458
Such arrogance! Such arrogance!

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:31.958
I wouldn't have given you a second look if I was any younger.

01:17:32.458 --> 01:17:34.791
Two really hip girls from my neighborhood proposed to me..

01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:37.125
..but I refused them only for you.

01:17:37.625 --> 01:17:39.291
Understand. Listen..

01:17:39.791 --> 01:17:41.250
If you don't love me yet, then do it now.

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:43.000
Have you lost your mind?

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.250
Do you have any idea..

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:47.125
..how much property my husband has in Surat?

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:51.458
Even I've booked a shop in Greater Noida.

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:53.666
I have a receipt.

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:56.458
So Jassi ruined all my plans of family planning.

01:17:56.958 --> 01:17:58.125
Then I talked to Sukanya.

01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.250
What's wrong?

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.208
What? - I need to go to the bathroom.

01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:05.250
Fine, we're talking after a long time.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.166
Sit down.

01:18:06.666 --> 01:18:09.333
Do you know where I met Sukanya?

01:18:09.833 --> 01:18:11.875
She said if your husband cannot give you a child..

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:15.208
..then try artificial insemination.

01:18:15.708 --> 01:18:17.625
So that child is artificial.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:19.541
Have you lost your mind after going to London?

01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:20.875
The child isn't artificial.

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:22.666
I mean...it's science.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:24.958
It's done with injection... and costs millions.

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:27.416
It's like...test tube baby.

01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:28.958
And so costly..

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:33.416
How much does kid this size cost?

01:18:33.916 --> 01:18:35.750
The child grows in your fetus, not the thermos.

01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:37.000
Have you lost your mind?

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.541
Am I drunk or are you?

01:18:41.041 --> 01:18:43.875
This new haircut suits you.

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:47.166
Why are you buying the same color Mercedes again?

01:18:47.666 --> 01:18:48.583
Why don't you change color?

01:18:49.083 --> 01:18:49.666
What do you mean?

01:18:50.166 --> 01:18:51.541
This one's like Tanu too.

01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:53.250
You could've tried something else.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.666
Like Aishwarya...Deepika...Katrina.

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.083
There are many new ones in the market now.

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:01.625
But you're doing great.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:04.958
My life is ruined.

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:07.125
Pappi!

01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:08.333
Come in.

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:11.208
Pappi. - Jassi.

01:19:11.708 --> 01:19:15.500
Pappi, how are you? - Great.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.083
Have a drink? Where were you?

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:22.541
Some cripple was bothering me.

01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:24.458
Manu, there is some cripple in the party.

01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:27.375
Where is he?

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:30.541
Who? - Pappi.

01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:33.708
Pappi was never here, Jassi.

01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:36.000
He was just saying..

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.458
Jassi, I think you're drunk.

01:19:38.958 --> 01:19:40.791
Pappi isn't here. Listen to me.

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.250
Get some rest.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:44.875
Here. Drink it.

01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:48.250
Are you there, Manu? - Come on. Drink it.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:49.791
No one knows that this child isn't Jassi's.

01:19:50.291 --> 01:19:52.583
They never leave her alone. Right?

01:19:53.083 --> 01:19:54.000
No one leaves her alone..

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.916
They're always carrying her in their arms.

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:57.750
Tanu..

01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.875
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:00.125
The bathroom's this way.

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:01.791
Tanu, I feel really guilty.

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:02.958
What do I do? Should I tell them?

01:20:03.458 --> 01:20:05.125
But if I tell him, it will hurt his manhood.

01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:06.250
They're such ignorant people..

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:08.000
..they measure their manhood with their sperm count.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.916
Look there..

01:20:11.416 --> 01:20:11.916
Oh...

01:20:12.416 --> 01:20:14.250
How did you do that? Did you hit her here? Karate.

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.833
What else could I do? She wasn't letting me leave.

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:18.583
I see. - Did she finish packing her bags? Shall we go?

01:20:19.083 --> 01:20:21.666
She says she doesn't love me.

01:20:22.166 --> 01:20:23.708
Doesn't love you?

01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:25.291
So...were you mistaken..

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:27.791
..or is she going back on her words.

01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:30.208
She's the one who's denying it. She still does.

01:20:30.708 --> 01:20:31.750
Then let's get out of here.

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.416
I think she'll say yes if you talk to her.

01:20:34.916 --> 01:20:35.750
What do I say to her?

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:37.916
If she isn't listening to you why will she listen to me?

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:41.958
No, no, I think she'll say yes if you talk to her.

01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:45.000
I should try talking to her once. - Yes.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.750
This side.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.750
You fools, Shahrukh Khan's outside.

01:20:56.458 --> 01:20:58.208
Come on.

01:20:58.708 --> 01:20:59.375
What are you doing?

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:02.166
That's what I want to ask you...

01:21:02.666 --> 01:21:04.708
Listen, listen... - Now, what are you doing?

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.375
Look, I'll scream.

01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:08.750
Your family's already making quite a racket.

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.625
Who's going to hear you? Listen to me.

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:13.958
What's your problem with this good man?

01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:16.083
What's so special about that boy from Surat?

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:20.500
Money. Even Pappi can earn a square meal.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.791
He loves you. He came this far for you.

01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:25.083
And you don't care.

01:21:25.583 --> 01:21:26.958
Shut up!

01:21:27.458 --> 01:21:29.458
Fools. Run away.

01:21:29.958 --> 01:21:31.291
She isn't listening.

01:21:31.791 --> 01:21:33.375
Shall I show her too?

01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:37.375
Look..

01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:43.458
What's wrong with her? - She's drunk.

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:46.916
Drunk?

01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:48.500
Payal.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.958
There was no Shahrukh Khan.

01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:55.333
She tricked us.. - She fooled us.

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:57.541
What happened? Payal? Payal?

01:21:58.041 --> 01:22:01.041
Payal?

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:03.750
That's him. Yes, him. This guy was sitting there.

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.916
Catch him. Don't let him go!

01:22:06.416 --> 01:22:09.916
Pappi..

01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:17.291
She has put on a lot of weight.

01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:19.333
You take so long.

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.750
Right, as if you were missing your flight.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:26.750
Mr. Sharma! - Mr. Sharma!

01:22:30.958 --> 01:22:35.000
Let's go. Let's go.

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.125
Run.

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:40.041
Come on, shift to second gear.

01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:44.041
Second.

01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:48.791
Stupid.

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:08.583
Thank you.

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:18.416
You know, Dhatto Manju is getting married today.

01:23:18.916 --> 01:23:20.333
Manju, you're getting married today.

01:23:20.833 --> 01:23:22.541
Yes.

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.291
Brother, keep sister-in-law there.

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:25.541
Dhatto is back.

01:23:26.041 --> 01:23:27.333
Greetings, grandma. - Greetings.

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:28.583
Where's everyone?

01:23:29.083 --> 01:23:33.375
They're all at Manju's place. Today is the musical ceremony at her place.

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:37.750
Give that to me, Mr. Sharma?

01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:40.083
Whose dead body is that? - Which one?

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:41.166
This one.

01:23:41.666 --> 01:23:44.250
Mr. Sharma, what will my brother..

01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:47.916
..call your brother's wife?

01:23:48.416 --> 01:23:51.000
What will he call her, Pappi? -Aunty.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.166
She's your aunty.

01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:53.375
And who's this man?

01:23:53.875 --> 01:23:55.125
Will you tell anyone? - No, I won't.

01:23:55.625 --> 01:24:00.833
No, you will tell everyone. - I will not. Give me 100 rupees.

01:24:01.333 --> 01:24:04.833
He's your brother-in-law.

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:14.500
I got 100 rupees. I got 100 rupees.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.666
Dhatto's brought brother-in-law home.

01:24:19.166 --> 01:24:21.166
Come here.

01:24:21.666 --> 01:24:22.791
Sir, we did the best we could.

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.458
Call the Commissioner first.

01:24:24.958 --> 01:24:28.458
Why do you drink so much if you can't digest it?

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:37.666
Tanu?

01:24:38.166 --> 01:24:39.750
Weren't you ashamed? - Look, mister..

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:42.291
Take him away! You brought these idiots back home with you.

01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:44.250
You went out to be famous.

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.708
Now I'll show you. - Show me what.

01:24:46.208 --> 01:24:48.250
I am not your wife. I am a state level athlete.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.083
I'll show you instead. I'll have you arrested.

01:24:51.583 --> 01:24:56.708
These idiots have polluted your mind..

01:24:57.208 --> 01:24:58.208
Leave my hand, Dhatto.

01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:00.083
Don't humiliate your family.

01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:01.958
I'm not even scared of my father.

01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:07.291
Hey take her away! - "I'm in love."

01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:13.166
"In love with you again."

01:25:13.666 --> 01:25:18.041
"Tell me what to do."

01:25:18.541 --> 01:25:23.833
"What to do?"

01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:29.291
"I'm in love."

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:34.875
"In love with you again."

01:25:35.375 --> 01:25:40.333
"Tell me what to do."

01:25:40.833 --> 01:25:45.708
"What to do?"

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:47.833
They're trying to burn us? - What?

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:48.750
Set us on fire.

01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:50.791
Mister..

01:25:51.291 --> 01:25:52.583
Listen, mister. - PT Usha...now I'll show you.

01:25:53.083 --> 01:25:54.041
Listen..

01:25:54.541 --> 01:25:55.500
You cannot take the law in your hands.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.208
What are you doing? - Hand us over to the police.

01:25:57.708 --> 01:25:58.375
Get lost.. go get the matches.

01:25:58.875 --> 01:26:01.333
Matches...for what?

01:26:01.833 --> 01:26:03.416
But he did come here, didn't he? - Yes..

01:26:03.916 --> 01:26:06.875
You were saying that..

01:26:07.375 --> 01:26:09.458
Stop this nonsense.

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:10.875
And try to understand what I am saying.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:12.166
Let's get to Kusum's village immediately..

01:26:12.666 --> 01:26:13.666
..or else we'll reach only after the wedding.

01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:16.208
Village? You said she lived in Delhi.

01:26:16.708 --> 01:26:18.208
Her brother lives in Delhi.

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:21.125
Her entire family lives in the Jhajjar district.

01:26:21.625 --> 01:26:23.125
Tanu, life has already served me many blows..

01:26:23.625 --> 01:26:24.208
..don't humiliate me anymore.

01:26:24.708 --> 01:26:25.583
Sir...get the car.

01:26:26.083 --> 01:26:28.958
Your friend has nipped you badly.

01:26:29.458 --> 01:26:32.958
Get the Pajero!

01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:37.750
Brother, give me your matches.

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:40.208
How are you? - Give me the matches.

01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:42.083
What will you do with them?

01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:46.166
We need to burn two people.

01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:47.041
Move aside.

01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:48.791
Here. Burn them. - Burn them.

01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:50.416
Hey.. - Wait. Let him burn them.

01:26:50.916 --> 01:26:54.666
Give it here. Shut up! Shut up!

01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:57.291
What's going on here?

01:26:57.791 --> 01:27:01.291
Have you all lost your mind?

01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:10.166
What?

01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:11.833
Nothing.

01:27:12.333 --> 01:27:15.916
You could've changed first.

01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:19.250
For 18 years, we've been fighting over this.

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:21.291
This is exactly why I left home.

01:27:21.791 --> 01:27:22.458
I quit wrestling.

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:24.625
I will get a small job, live in a small home..

01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:28.125
..but stay away from ignorant' like you.

01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:30.958
And keep my sister away too.

01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:33.791
The girls world-over are making progress.

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:37.166
But you...keep your daughters tied to your courtyards.

01:27:37.666 --> 01:27:38.916
Don't let them make any progress.

01:27:39.416 --> 01:27:41.625
Either you kill them before they are born.

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:45.375
And if she grows up, then strangle her to death.

01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:47.166
Weren't you ashamed of assaulting..

01:27:47.666 --> 01:27:49.458
..a girl that carved a niche for herself.

01:27:49.958 --> 01:27:51.541
Speak up. Why don't you speak?

01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:53.750
You think beating these girls make you a man.

01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:55.666
She could've eloped and got married.

01:27:56.166 --> 01:27:56.791
But her mistake was..

01:27:57.291 --> 01:27:59.041
..she came to get permission from idiots like you.

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:00.833
Omi, we aren't against it.

01:28:01.333 --> 01:28:02.583
But there's something as community.

01:28:03.083 --> 01:28:03.833
Right.

01:28:04.333 --> 01:28:06.708
You all belong to the royal families of Rajasthan, don't you?

01:28:07.208 --> 01:28:09.416
Which is why you're so concerned about your community.

01:28:09.916 --> 01:28:12.458
And uncle, do you belong to the dinosaur family?

01:28:12.958 --> 01:28:14.250
And if your daughter married someone else..

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:15.416
..we'll all go extinct.

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:19.541
Look, he's absolutely right. In fact, I would say.. - Be quiet.

01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:21.125
The can of kerosene is still besides us.

01:28:21.625 --> 01:28:23.750
He's doing good, let him.

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:24.958
Brother Omi, please send Dhatto.

01:28:25.458 --> 01:28:30.000
I applied henna on one hand now I need to get my other hand done.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.125
Go, dear. She's upstairs.

01:28:32.625 --> 01:28:33.583
Take her along.

01:28:34.083 --> 01:28:37.666
Everyone listen carefully.

01:28:38.166 --> 01:28:38.875
She's my sister.

01:28:39.375 --> 01:28:41.041
She can marry anyone she wants.

01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:42.708
Just try and stop her.

01:28:43.208 --> 01:28:46.708
And I'll show you what brains are for.

01:29:08.083 --> 01:29:10.125
"Like a hot-air balloon she's rising up."

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.083
"No one can lay a hand on her."

01:29:12.583 --> 01:29:16.375
"The girl's shining like thunder."

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:21.083
"Issued in the interest of public interest."

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:25.291
"Now you handle this responsibility."

01:29:25.791 --> 01:29:30.041
"She keeps chatting...waves her hands around."

01:29:30.541 --> 01:29:33.958
"Never takes a backseat."

01:29:34.458 --> 01:29:38.583
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:42.708
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

01:29:43.208 --> 01:29:47.375
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

01:29:47.875 --> 01:29:51.791
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:56.250
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

01:29:56.750 --> 01:30:00.250
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:14.416
"You're pure gold, neither silver nor copper."

01:30:14.916 --> 01:30:18.416
"Every subject she touches...she's a topper."

01:30:23.625 --> 01:30:27.708
"She flies away with her own wings proper."

01:30:28.208 --> 01:30:32.125
"Even bhangda feels proud if you accept its offer."

01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:34.541
"Never listens...always stubborn."

01:30:35.041 --> 01:30:36.625
"And the sharp wit."

01:30:37.125 --> 01:30:40.875
"She's a double-edged sword."

01:30:41.375 --> 01:30:43.333
"Don't know if she's coming or going."

01:30:43.833 --> 01:30:45.541
"She's running around in the lane."

01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:49.875
"Better be prepared."

01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:52.041
"She jumps around."

01:30:52.541 --> 01:30:54.500
"She leaps and pounces."

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.375
"She never looks relaxing."

01:30:58.875 --> 01:31:02.916
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:06.458
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

01:31:06.958 --> 01:31:07.458
"..Beautiful."

01:31:07.958 --> 01:31:11.750
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:15.750
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:50.208
Come.

01:31:50.708 --> 01:31:52.375
Listen don't try to stop me today.

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:55.083
Yeah...yeah....we'll see.

01:31:55.583 --> 01:31:58.333
Look there.

01:31:58.833 --> 01:32:00.833
Hey got it!

01:32:01.333 --> 01:32:06.125
You can't stab me again and marry her.

01:32:06.625 --> 01:32:10.125
What happened, mister?

01:32:15.666 --> 01:32:18.750
Hey...Hanuman.

01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:22.000
Sister-in-law...you?

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:25.250
Trying to sneak away. - No, no. I...was..

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.458
Where's your brother?

01:32:27.958 --> 01:32:29.125
Who? Manu?

01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:32.833
I haven't met him for years. Is he here?

01:32:33.333 --> 01:32:34.208
Where's Komal? - Komal who?

01:32:34.708 --> 01:32:36.125
Komal. - Hold on.

01:32:36.625 --> 01:32:38.500
I saw her at the ice-cream counter.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:39.291
Komal.

01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:40.041
What?

01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:41.791
Forgive me, brother.

01:32:42.291 --> 01:32:42.916
By the time I got there..

01:32:43.416 --> 01:32:44.541
..they had already kidnapped her.

01:32:45.041 --> 01:32:47.750
Sister-in-law, it's all ruined.

01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:49.041
Hold on.

01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:53.041
Komal, look who's here for you.

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:02.000
O Doctor!

01:33:07.875 --> 01:33:09.458
Wow, Mr. Sharma.

01:33:09.958 --> 01:33:11.875
I turned sordid..

01:33:12.375 --> 01:33:14.583
..but you turned completely shameless.

01:33:15.083 --> 01:33:15.791
Don't worry.

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:18.625
I only came here to see your bride.

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:22.625
Who is the one who did what I couldn't do in four years?

01:33:54.500 --> 01:34:00.208
Awasthi, you said she looks like me.

01:34:00.708 --> 01:34:04.208
Settle for reebook instead of Reebok, right?

01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:10.958
Mr. Sharma, you found her to replace me?

01:34:11.458 --> 01:34:15.333
This joker. This ignorant.

01:34:15.833 --> 01:34:17.166
You deserve better than this.

01:34:17.666 --> 01:34:18.958
I deserve better than this.

01:34:19.458 --> 01:34:21.458
You should've thought about my honor at least.

01:34:21.958 --> 01:34:23.958
Hey girl...come to your senses.

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.333
Talk respectfully.

01:34:25.833 --> 01:34:28.375
You're laughing at me. What about you?

01:34:28.875 --> 01:34:30.041
You couldn't manage your own home.

01:34:30.541 --> 01:34:33.666
Your father raised you first and then, Mr. Sharma took care of you.

01:34:34.166 --> 01:34:35.833
You never even bought an underwear with your own money.

01:34:36.333 --> 01:34:37.250
Laughing at me.

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:39.500
You can see the world, booze and buy fashionable clothes..

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
..with his credit card.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.166
How can you call me ignorant?

01:34:42.666 --> 01:34:45.375
I got admission in Delhi University through sports quota.

01:34:45.875 --> 01:34:47.333
I am a state level athlete.

01:34:47.833 --> 01:34:50.458
Calling me ignorant.

01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:52.583
And listen...I am not over smart like you.

01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:54.458
But I can earn a penny for my family..

01:34:54.958 --> 01:34:55.625
..and also take care of the kids.

01:34:56.125 --> 01:34:57.125
You cannot even earn a penny..

01:34:57.625 --> 01:35:01.125
..and kids are not your cup of tea.

01:35:04.833 --> 01:35:05.625
What are you staring at me for?

01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:06.750
Aren't you going to say something to her?

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.916
No one's going to say anything.

01:35:09.416 --> 01:35:11.291
One has to maintain relations to keep them.

01:35:11.791 --> 01:35:15.291
You shut up, you... - Tanu!

01:35:21.625 --> 01:35:25.125
Omi, fix a date for the marriage.

01:35:30.875 --> 01:35:32.791
Can I garland her?

01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:36.000
Go on. Go on. Everyone look here.

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.458
Tanu

01:35:38.958 --> 01:35:40.583
Speak in

01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:42.125
Hello...just because you're in Haryana..

01:35:42.625 --> 01:35:43.958
..you cannot speak in this new and new feudal terms.

01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:45.625
Okay? She's chosen to be a woman of leisure.

01:35:46.125 --> 01:35:47.083
What can you say?

01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:49.416
Tell your husband how you had your kid.

01:35:49.916 --> 01:35:53.875
Madam... what do you mean by how?

01:35:54.375 --> 01:35:55.958
This is as usual.

01:35:56.458 --> 01:35:58.208
I'll tell you the truth.

01:35:58.708 --> 01:36:01.750
Tell her.

01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:04.250
Speak up.

01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:08.708
In the hospital, where else?

01:36:09.208 --> 01:36:11.166
What will happen to you now, dear?

01:36:11.666 --> 01:36:15.125
Your loving father even refuses to see your face now.

01:36:15.625 --> 01:36:17.125
Or your mother's face.

01:36:17.625 --> 01:36:18.541
We're ruined.

01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:20.458
You're ruined too, Tanu.

01:36:20.958 --> 01:36:26.125
That long-fanged witch devoured your marriage.

01:36:26.625 --> 01:36:28.583
And she ruined my marriage too.

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:30.458
Idiot.

01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:31.583
She broke my neck.

01:36:32.083 --> 01:36:34.916
Broke our marriages.

01:36:35.416 --> 01:36:38.333
Bad.

01:36:38.833 --> 01:36:39.833
This is it, Tanu.

01:36:40.333 --> 01:36:40.916
Love, affection, inter-caste marriage...

01:36:41.416 --> 01:36:43.375
Bindi, bangles, the nuptial rounds, I love you..

01:36:43.875 --> 01:36:45.916
Just one artificial insemination, and everything's over.

01:36:46.416 --> 01:36:48.333
"What kind of love is this?"

01:36:48.833 --> 01:36:52.125
What was that song we used to sing when we were in 1st year.

01:36:52.625 --> 01:36:53.458
Have you lost your mind, Tanu?

01:36:53.958 --> 01:36:56.333
You aren't listening to what I am saying.

01:36:56.833 --> 01:36:59.666
"What is this love...this affection."

01:37:00.166 --> 01:37:04.291
You used to sing that, right?

01:37:04.791 --> 01:37:08.291
"Go away...O Betrayer."

01:37:25.958 --> 01:37:30.458
"Go away...O Betrayer."

01:37:30.958 --> 01:37:36.125
"What is this love...this affection."

01:37:36.625 --> 01:37:41.625
"You're no one's beloved."

01:37:42.125 --> 01:37:47.458
"All your promises are fake."

01:37:47.958 --> 01:37:51.458
"Go away...O Betrayer."

01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:10.333
"I've seen your loyalty."

01:38:10.833 --> 01:38:16.125
"And the unanswered prayers."

01:38:16.625 --> 01:38:21.875
"You didn't think about my heart."

01:38:22.375 --> 01:38:27.541
"I've seen your loyalty."

01:38:28.041 --> 01:38:33.291
"And the unanswered prayers."

01:38:33.791 --> 01:38:38.750
"I've seen your loyalty."

01:38:39.250 --> 01:38:42.750
"Go away...O Betrayer."

01:38:56.583 --> 01:39:01.583
"Why shouldn't I sigh with sorrow?"

01:39:02.083 --> 01:39:07.458
"I miss you, what to do."

01:39:07.958 --> 01:39:13.250
"Just tell me oh ignorant."

01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:18.750
"Should I live or die thinking of you."

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:24.666
"Just tell me oh ignorant."

01:39:25.166 --> 01:39:30.416
"Should I live or die thinking of you."

01:39:30.916 --> 01:39:36.041
"Go away...O Betrayer."

01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:41.541
"What is this love...this affection."

01:39:42.041 --> 01:39:46.958
"You're no one's beloved."

01:39:47.458 --> 01:39:53.291
"All your promises are fake."

01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:57.291
"Go away...O Betrayer."

01:41:11.375 --> 01:41:14.875
What's all this?

01:41:22.625 --> 01:41:24.666
That Kusum humiliated me..

01:41:25.166 --> 01:41:34.041
..and you just stood there, and said nothing.

01:41:34.541 --> 01:41:38.541
I was always like that, crazy.

01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:42.541
When did you change, Mr. Sharma?

01:41:46.958 --> 01:41:50.458
Don't you miss me?

01:41:57.750 --> 01:42:01.250
I don't.

01:43:38.083 --> 01:43:43.833
Will you come along without asking any questions?

01:43:44.333 --> 01:43:47.833
If it's not too urgent, can I take a bath?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:57.958
What is this?

01:43:58.458 --> 01:44:01.958
Divorce papers.

01:44:05.958 --> 01:44:09.458
Congratulations.

01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:40.041
I am very embarrassed for whatever happened yesterday.

01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:43.000
But Mr. Sharma has done a lot of favors on me.

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:47.708
He handled all the arrangements in my marriage.

01:44:48.208 --> 01:44:50.458
If I can help out in his marriage..

01:44:50.958 --> 01:44:55.083
..I may be able to repay a part of my debt.

01:44:55.583 --> 01:44:59.083
Please!

01:45:09.333 --> 01:45:12.041
When is the marriage? - On the 18th..

01:45:12.541 --> 01:45:16.041
Great, you'll be out of here in a week.

01:45:27.458 --> 01:45:33.125
"The horizon's empty, where do I look for you?"

01:45:33.625 --> 01:45:38.375
"Where are you, I can't see you...listen to my heart calling out."

01:45:38.875 --> 01:45:41.416
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:45:41.916 --> 01:45:44.458
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:45:44.958 --> 01:45:47.666
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:45:48.166 --> 01:45:51.541
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:45:52.041 --> 01:45:54.666
"I yearn for you, makes me breathless."

01:45:55.166 --> 01:45:58.666
"My heart's lonely."

01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:33.666
"What bond is this? I can see it in your eyes."

01:46:34.166 --> 01:46:40.625
"What bond is this? I can see it in your eyes."

01:46:41.125 --> 01:46:46.958
"It's getting crushed between two hearts."

01:46:47.458 --> 01:46:53.125
"It's getting crushed between two hearts."

01:46:53.625 --> 01:46:58.458
"Don't ignore your heart."

01:46:58.958 --> 01:47:01.625
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:04.458
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:47:04.958 --> 01:47:07.666
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:47:08.166 --> 01:47:11.500
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.541
"I yearn for you, makes me breathless."

01:47:15.041 --> 01:47:18.541
"My heart's lonely."

01:47:29.625 --> 01:47:32.125
"My heart's full of love."

01:47:32.625 --> 01:47:35.208
"It's a stubborn bird."

01:47:35.708 --> 01:47:38.333
"My heart's full of love."

01:47:38.833 --> 01:47:42.333
"It's a stubborn bird."

01:47:42.833 --> 01:47:48.541
"Expectations have clipped my wings, but hope keeps me alive."

01:47:49.041 --> 01:47:54.666
"Expectations have clipped my wings, but hope keeps me alive."

01:47:55.166 --> 01:48:02.333
"Don't ignore my humble request.. - More water. - Listen.

01:48:02.833 --> 01:48:04.541
What's wrong with you? Why are you doing this?

01:48:05.041 --> 01:48:06.291
I don't know.

01:48:06.791 --> 01:48:07.958
I love you, Mr. Sharma.

01:48:08.458 --> 01:48:10.750
I know you can't live without me either.

01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:12.583
You think we'll all do as you want.

01:48:13.083 --> 01:48:13.708
And no one will say anything.

01:48:14.208 --> 01:48:16.250
You can say anything you want but let's go home, please.

01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:17.791
Don't you get it, Tanuja Trivedi.

01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:19.750
Everything is over! It's over.

01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:22.208
After a point of time one gives up. So did mine.

01:48:22.708 --> 01:48:25.666
I can't do anything more than this. Please, go away.

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:28.916
I haven't given up yet, Manoj Sharma.

01:48:29.416 --> 01:48:32.708
I will leave only after I see you married.

01:48:33.208 --> 01:48:33.416
Tanu!

01:48:33.916 --> 01:48:36.958
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:48:37.458 --> 01:48:39.750
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:42.875
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:48:43.375 --> 01:48:46.833
"Don't go away...Don't go."

01:48:47.333 --> 01:48:49.875
"I yearn for you, makes me breathless."

01:48:50.375 --> 01:48:53.875
"My heart's lonely."

01:49:10.125 --> 01:49:11.833
I warned you before.

01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:14.583
The cold is getting worse.

01:49:15.083 --> 01:49:17.416
And I also said..

01:49:17.916 --> 01:49:22.583
..that she should take care, but she didn't listen.

01:49:23.083 --> 01:49:25.250
Now he's caught a cold.

01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:28.833
Kusum.

01:49:29.333 --> 01:49:32.833
Can we talk for a minute, please?

01:49:35.041 --> 01:49:36.458
Do you stitch shrouds too?

01:49:36.958 --> 01:49:38.708
What are you saying?

01:49:39.208 --> 01:49:41.333
If you don't, then get me a readymade one.

01:49:41.833 --> 01:49:42.750
One for you and one for him.

01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:44.375
Shut up, Pappi.

01:49:44.875 --> 01:49:46.333
Bless you, doctor.

01:49:46.833 --> 01:49:49.208
Getting a suit stitched again.

01:49:49.708 --> 01:49:52.416
I haven't had one chance of getting married..

01:49:52.916 --> 01:49:56.583
..and he's looking to score once again.

01:49:57.083 --> 01:49:57.791
Are you blind?

01:49:58.291 --> 01:49:59.375
Don't you see your wife?

01:49:59.875 --> 01:50:02.208
Look at her condition. She's gone crazy?

01:50:02.708 --> 01:50:05.708
Is this why you faced me so bravely that day?

01:50:06.208 --> 01:50:08.083
You should've let me marry her instead.

01:50:08.583 --> 01:50:10.083
I loved her, and I would've handled her too.

01:50:10.583 --> 01:50:11.916
And that girl...Datto.

01:50:12.416 --> 01:50:13.458
She thinks there's nothing wrong..

01:50:13.958 --> 01:50:14.916
..if her face matches with Tanu.

01:50:15.416 --> 01:50:16.291
This is a sin.

01:50:16.791 --> 01:50:17.958
It's a sin. Big sin.

01:50:18.458 --> 01:50:19.708
He's a sinner.

01:50:20.208 --> 01:50:23.750
He thinks she's nave and innocent.

01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:25.916
And it's the same face he fell in love with the first time.

01:50:26.416 --> 01:50:27.583
So pounce on it.

01:50:28.083 --> 01:50:29.083
The old one's run her course.

01:50:29.583 --> 01:50:31.333
That's not it. - That's exactly it.

01:50:31.833 --> 01:50:33.541
That's not it.

01:50:34.041 --> 01:50:35.500
I didn't tell her to send me the divorce letter.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.125
That was a stupid fool boy from Rampur..

01:50:38.625 --> 01:50:40.166
..who made all this mess.

01:50:40.666 --> 01:50:41.416
Oh!

01:50:41.916 --> 01:50:43.375
Forgive these two.

01:50:43.875 --> 01:50:44.666
Manu made a mistake.

01:50:45.166 --> 01:50:47.000
And Tanu has never done anything right in her life.

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.375
They both are big fools.

01:50:48.875 --> 01:50:49.791
But you're the smart one.

01:50:50.291 --> 01:50:51.625
Everyone can see their condition.

01:50:52.125 --> 01:50:55.500
They are so sad. You didn't notice because you're occupied.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.541
Husband and wife often quarrel.. - Madam.

01:51:00.041 --> 01:51:02.166
They were husband and wife.

01:51:02.666 --> 01:51:04.208
But they aren't any more.

01:51:04.708 --> 01:51:06.791
And what haven't I noticed?

01:51:07.291 --> 01:51:10.541
Are you crazy?

01:51:11.041 --> 01:51:14.541
Didn't you notice the love between me and Mr. Sharma?

01:51:17.666 --> 01:51:21.166
Raja, I am sorry you got involved in this again.

01:51:21.666 --> 01:51:24.583
Look, if I knew that Datto... - Forget that, doctor.

01:51:25.083 --> 01:51:26.416
Tell me something new.

01:51:26.916 --> 01:51:29.625
I am shocked that I've been nipped in the bud again.

01:51:30.125 --> 01:51:31.875
Let's be clear about what to do next.

01:51:32.375 --> 01:51:35.250
You tell me what we can do.

01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:37.208
All the arrangements are done.

01:51:37.708 --> 01:51:38.166
Nothing can be done now.

01:51:38.666 --> 01:51:40.458
Why not?

01:51:40.958 --> 01:51:44.000
Say no to this marriage and go back with Tanu.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.958
And you...get lost.

01:51:47.458 --> 01:51:50.958
Come on, get lost. No one's getting a suit stitched.

01:51:53.083 --> 01:51:56.083
Look...I don't have all those qualities.

01:51:56.583 --> 01:51:59.666
Just that I always stick to my word.

01:52:00.166 --> 01:52:04.875
That day it was Tanu, and now with Datto.

01:52:05.375 --> 01:52:06.000
See..

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.666
If I can't do this, then I'll be just 80 kilos of dead meat.

01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:10.458
Nothing more.

01:52:10.958 --> 01:52:12.791
What are you saying? What about the fact that you married Tanu..

01:52:13.291 --> 01:52:14.250
..the same way.

01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:15.250
These days he's following in the..

01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:18.416
..footsteps of Salman Khan on commitments.

01:52:18.916 --> 01:52:19.875
But everything is not that simple.

01:52:20.375 --> 01:52:21.416
Consider the entire matter first.

01:52:21.916 --> 01:52:23.625
Whatever it was, but they were married for 4 years,

01:52:24.125 --> 01:52:24.791
There are 2 families involved in this.

01:52:25.291 --> 01:52:26.750
How can Manu just marry someone.. - Look, sister..

01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:28.833
..I am getting married tomorrow.

01:52:29.333 --> 01:52:30.208
I am really busy.

01:52:30.708 --> 01:52:32.875
I know you're feeling bad about your friend.

01:52:33.375 --> 01:52:34.791
But there's nothing I or Mr. Sharma can do.

01:52:35.291 --> 01:52:38.250
Mr. Sharma wants.. - Look.

01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:41.416
If Mr. Sharma tells me that, I won't marry him.

01:52:41.916 --> 01:52:45.416
Now get out.

01:52:48.083 --> 01:52:49.000
Where are you going?

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:52.083
Everyone's left this guy behind.

01:52:52.583 --> 01:52:55.041
Left him behind.

01:52:55.541 --> 01:52:59.500
Where's mama? Where's mama?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:00.708
She left you.

01:53:01.208 --> 01:53:02.333
She left you.

01:53:02.833 --> 01:53:04.708
It was a mistake, Jassi.

01:53:05.208 --> 01:53:09.125
I didn't tell you because I didn't want to hurt you.

01:53:09.625 --> 01:53:13.125
Forgive me.

01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:32.583
Mr. Sharma.

01:53:33.083 --> 01:53:36.583
I'll be right with you.

01:53:38.958 --> 01:53:41.541
Mr. Sharma, Payal came to see me..

01:53:42.041 --> 01:53:43.875
Nothing will change, Datto.

01:53:44.375 --> 01:53:46.750
All these things happening the past few days..

01:53:47.250 --> 01:53:50.041
Tanu coming here..

01:53:50.541 --> 01:53:52.416
..I am really sorry for that.

01:53:52.916 --> 01:53:58.375
You must have found me unsure, and..

01:53:58.875 --> 01:54:02.916
All I want to say is don't worry.

01:54:03.416 --> 01:54:06.916
I'll be a good husband.

01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:16.125
Then get ready and come to the dais.

01:54:16.625 --> 01:54:19.166
Yes, just hope things don't get in a mess later.

01:54:19.666 --> 01:54:21.333
Let that go, dear. It'll tear.

01:54:21.833 --> 01:54:24.458
Is it real? - Yes, absolutely real.

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:27.166
We'll make a similar one for your groom.

01:54:27.666 --> 01:54:31.791
Get up everyone. The groom's here.

01:54:32.291 --> 01:54:35.166
Why are you holding that?

01:54:35.666 --> 01:54:38.000
Come on. Climb the horse.

01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.916
Can't we walk or go in a car?

01:54:40.416 --> 01:54:41.250
What are you saying? It might be your second..

01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:42.541
..but it's my sister's first marriage.

01:54:43.041 --> 01:54:44.083
Come on, come on.

01:54:44.583 --> 01:54:45.291
Bring the boy.

01:54:45.791 --> 01:54:47.125
It's alright.

01:54:47.625 --> 01:54:49.125
Don't be scared. Climb up.

01:54:49.625 --> 01:54:49.791
Pappi.

01:54:50.291 --> 01:54:52.458
Listen to me..

01:54:52.958 --> 01:54:54.458
Give me a quarter.

01:54:54.958 --> 01:54:57.000
What have you been drinking?

01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:01.000
Give it to me.

01:55:07.083 --> 01:55:09.625
Daddy, how about a drink? - Are you crazy?

01:55:10.125 --> 01:55:11.416
Fine, I'll have a peg. Give me 100 rupees.

01:55:11.916 --> 01:55:12.708
I don't have money.

01:55:13.208 --> 01:55:14.416
What do you mean you don't? - I don't.

01:55:14.916 --> 01:55:17.750
Old man...what about the 6 month of rent that I paid you.

01:55:18.250 --> 01:55:18.791
That was a year ago.

01:55:19.291 --> 01:55:20.041
Fine, you can deduct it from the dowry.

01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:21.041
What dowry?

01:55:21.541 --> 01:55:22.541
That's not it. - What are you saying?

01:55:23.041 --> 01:55:25.333
Uncle, everything is ruined and you're coming now.

01:55:25.833 --> 01:55:27.958
Why you..

01:55:28.458 --> 01:55:30.208
No need to be scared.

01:55:30.708 --> 01:55:34.291
I'll break your head. - So hit me. Hit me.

01:55:34.791 --> 01:55:36.250
Throw away the stone.

01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:39.833
We don't know whose side we're on.

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:41.458
We're on the right side.

01:55:41.958 --> 01:55:42.958
We're on the right side..

01:55:43.458 --> 01:55:44.708
..but which is the right side?

01:55:45.208 --> 01:55:48.708
The right thing to do is get out of here.

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:56.000
How can we just leave, Awasthi?

01:56:00.833 --> 01:56:03.416
I want to feel humiliated some more.

01:56:03.916 --> 01:56:07.416
Come in marriage party.

01:56:22.541 --> 01:56:25.500
The smiles of their face, joys of the heart..

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.500
..and shame, wonder what else your lovers have sacrificed for you.

01:56:35.708 --> 01:56:37.583
"O beloved.."

01:56:38.083 --> 01:56:40.250
"O beloved.."

01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:44.625
"I did what I didn't want to, my world's come crashing down."

01:56:45.125 --> 01:56:49.250
"I did what I didn't want to, my world's come crashing down."

01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:53.791
"A hale and hearty, good looking girl has gone crazy."

01:56:54.291 --> 01:56:56.208
"I've gone crazy."

01:56:56.708 --> 01:56:58.583
"I've gone crazy."

01:56:59.083 --> 01:57:00.750
"I've gone crazy."

01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:03.000
"I've gone crazy."

01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.458
"I've gone crazy."

01:57:05.958 --> 01:57:08.583
"I've gone crazy."

01:57:09.083 --> 01:57:13.000
"Every morning... in the pitch darkness."

01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:14.208
"I ran from home."

01:57:14.708 --> 01:57:17.833
"I ran from home only for you."

01:57:18.333 --> 01:57:22.583
"Without a reason, in the middle of the night."

01:57:23.083 --> 01:57:26.625
"I woke up in the middle of the night for you."

01:57:27.125 --> 01:57:30.916
"Don't listen to the world, listen to what my heart's saying.

01:57:31.416 --> 01:57:33.416
"I've gone crazy."

01:57:33.916 --> 01:57:35.791
"I've gone crazy."

01:57:36.291 --> 01:57:39.791
"I've gone crazy."

01:57:53.291 --> 01:57:57.541
"Here and there, and everywhere."

01:57:58.041 --> 01:58:02.208
"I've come back...back to you."

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:06.791
"First the world and now the Lord itself."

01:58:07.291 --> 01:58:10.708
"I've fallen in your love."

01:58:11.208 --> 01:58:15.375
"I hope you won't cry when I go away."

01:58:15.875 --> 01:58:17.750
"I've gone crazy."

01:58:18.250 --> 01:58:19.958
"I've gone crazy."

01:58:20.458 --> 01:58:22.208
"I've gone crazy."

01:58:22.708 --> 01:58:25.166
"I've gone crazy."

01:58:25.666 --> 01:58:29.791
"You have gone crazy."

01:58:30.291 --> 01:58:34.458
"Yes...you have... you have gone crazy."

01:58:34.958 --> 01:58:38.458
"You've gone crazy."

01:58:38.958 --> 01:58:42.625
"I've gone crazy."

01:58:43.125 --> 01:58:46.750
Tanu!

01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:47.500
Dear.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:48.041
Greetings.

01:58:48.541 --> 01:58:49.166
To bad with your greetings.

01:58:49.666 --> 01:58:51.125
Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing here?

01:58:51.625 --> 01:58:52.500
She is your daughter-in-law.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.500
Dear, let's go from here.

01:58:58.833 --> 01:59:02.333
Tanu, don't be scared. I am here.

01:59:02.833 --> 01:59:03.625
Hey you..

01:59:04.125 --> 01:59:04.583
Awasthi..

01:59:05.083 --> 01:59:07.333
Abuse me, but don't hit me. - Stop. Stop.

01:59:07.833 --> 01:59:08.333
Who is he?

01:59:08.833 --> 01:59:10.083
Tanu, what do you want?

01:59:10.583 --> 01:59:12.166
I want to see Manu get married.

01:59:12.666 --> 01:59:14.000
Don't beat me again.

01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:15.500
Move back! Move back!

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.916
I've left a letter at Hazratganj police station..

01:59:18.416 --> 01:59:19.583
..stating that if I don't return in 3 days..

01:59:20.083 --> 01:59:22.041
..then Raja Awasthi is responsible for my death.

01:59:22.541 --> 01:59:24.125
Should I drink this? Should I?

01:59:24.625 --> 01:59:25.958
You'll be charged with sections 302 and 307..

01:59:26.458 --> 01:59:27.583
..and rot in jail.

01:59:28.083 --> 01:59:29.916
Move. Move.

01:59:30.416 --> 01:59:32.208
I am here for my bride.

01:59:32.708 --> 01:59:36.208
Your time's up.

01:59:58.875 --> 02:00:02.375
Now garland each other.

02:00:06.125 --> 02:00:09.625
Now garland each other.

02:00:21.958 --> 02:00:25.458
Now they'll pour the water.

02:01:11.916 --> 02:01:15.416
Do you want to say something, Mr. Sharma?

02:01:18.166 --> 02:01:19.416
This is the last round.

02:01:19.916 --> 02:01:23.416
After this our marriage will be finalized.

02:01:33.666 --> 02:01:37.166
I can't do it.

02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.416
I am an athlete, Mr. Sharma.

02:01:44.916 --> 02:01:47.708
I either win or come last.

02:01:48.208 --> 02:01:51.083
Never settle for consolation prize.

02:01:51.583 --> 02:01:55.583
But who were you putting up this charade for. For me?

02:01:56.083 --> 02:01:57.791
Have you heard those announcements in airplanes?

02:01:58.291 --> 02:02:01.458
"Please fasten your seatbelts before helping others."

02:02:01.958 --> 02:02:03.791
You look after yourself and your wife.

02:02:04.291 --> 02:02:05.916
Don't worry about me!

02:02:06.416 --> 02:02:07.583
I didn't want a wedding like this.

02:02:08.083 --> 02:02:09.416
Look at everyone's faces.

02:02:09.916 --> 02:02:13.416
No one's happy. Not even me.

02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:25.916
Thank you.

02:02:26.416 --> 02:02:27.916
I'll send you the bill.

02:02:28.416 --> 02:02:30.083
Just pay that.

02:02:30.583 --> 02:02:34.083
Thank you.

02:03:20.791 --> 02:03:25.291
Datto, will you never get married.

02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:28.500
Tell me. - Will you never get married again?

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:29.125
Datto..

02:03:29.625 --> 02:03:31.375
Manoj Sharma, how are you getting this girl everytime?

02:03:31.875 --> 02:03:34.708
Why did you give birth to him?

02:03:35.208 --> 02:03:36.541
In my next life, I'll be born as your son.

02:03:37.041 --> 02:03:39.916
And I swear I'll sell your home..

02:03:40.416 --> 02:03:42.291
..and make you two rot in the old-age home..

02:03:42.791 --> 02:03:45.000
..or my name isn't Advocate Arun Kumar Singh.

02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:46.041
Lord..

02:03:46.541 --> 02:03:47.541
Tell me. - Shut up!

02:03:48.041 --> 02:03:52.625
I...Rampur Session Judge, Rajesh Kumar Singh's son..

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:56.083
Today in this gathering..

02:03:56.583 --> 02:03:58.625
Who is he? - God knows who he is.

02:03:59.125 --> 02:04:00.875
Their marriage won't last for two days.

02:04:01.375 --> 02:04:02.791
They will be ruined

02:04:03.291 --> 02:04:04.875
..you will feed on each other's flesh.

02:04:05.375 --> 02:04:09.875
Hey boy...stop this.

02:04:10.375 --> 02:04:10.958
Yes, sister.

02:04:11.458 --> 02:04:13.000
Look there.

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:17.625
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

02:04:18.125 --> 02:04:21.083
Cannot eat.

02:04:21.583 --> 02:04:25.083
Had some 'Dahi-vada'.

02:04:30.083 --> 02:04:30.250
Disgusting,

02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:34.625
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

02:04:35.125 --> 02:04:40.958
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

02:04:41.458 --> 02:04:47.250
If you go looking for a 3rd one, will she be like her too?

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:51.833
That's enough, all my desires are fulfilled now.

02:04:52.333 --> 02:04:57.125
I thought there will be a 3rd time.

02:04:57.625 --> 02:05:03.208
The other day you said you didn't miss me at all.

02:05:03.708 --> 02:05:07.208
What do you think?

02:05:10.208 --> 02:05:15.708
Isn't this the same tie I gifted you on your 40th birthday?

02:05:16.208 --> 02:05:19.708
Why did you wear it today?

02:05:20.208 --> 02:05:22.458
It was matching.

02:05:22.958 --> 02:05:23.833
Matching..

02:05:24.333 --> 02:05:26.958
That means you have no sentimental attachments no value for it.

02:05:27.458 --> 02:05:28.833
No, I do. - Just a matching tie with your suit.

02:05:29.333 --> 02:05:30.041
It's just a blue tie.

02:05:30.541 --> 02:05:31.125
No..

02:05:31.625 --> 02:05:37.041
So.. - It's a tie you gave me for 40th..

02:05:37.541 --> 02:05:39.625
"Like a hot-air balloon she's rising up."

02:05:40.125 --> 02:05:41.708
"No one can lay a hand on her."

02:05:42.208 --> 02:05:45.833
"The girl's shining like thunder."

02:05:46.333 --> 02:05:50.583
"Issued in the interest of public interest."

02:05:51.083 --> 02:05:54.791
"Now you handle this responsibility."

02:05:55.291 --> 02:05:57.166
"She keeps chatting..."

02:05:57.666 --> 02:05:59.500
"..waves her hands around."

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.458
"Never takes a backseat."

02:06:03.958 --> 02:06:07.916
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

02:06:08.416 --> 02:06:12.333
"Sweetheart...your swagger ..."

02:06:12.833 --> 02:06:16.958
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

02:06:17.458 --> 02:06:21.208
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

02:06:21.708 --> 02:06:25.666
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."

02:06:26.166 --> 02:06:30.250
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."

02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:34.708
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

02:06:35.208 --> 02:06:39.041
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

02:06:39.541 --> 02:06:43.875
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."

02:06:44.375 --> 02:06:47.375
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."

02:06:48.305 --> 02:06:54.677
