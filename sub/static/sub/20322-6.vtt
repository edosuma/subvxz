WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.562
I tell ya, this is real nice,

00:02.592 --> 00:04.504
us getting together to have breakfast.

00:07.014 --> 00:08.349
It seems like we've
all been so busy lately,

00:08.379 --> 00:09.820
we haven't had the chance lately to just...

00:09.850 --> 00:11.171
Catch up.

00:12.986 --> 00:14.606
Yeah, it's the sparkling
conversation I miss the most.

00:14.936 --> 00:17.475
Sorry, this oatmeal is really good.

00:17.505 --> 00:18.494
- Hmm.
- Right?!

00:18.524 --> 00:21.282
This is the best I've ever had.
And I don't usually like spinach.

00:21.312 --> 00:24.024
Well, I can't take all the credit for it.

00:24.054 --> 00:26.377
Or any, really. I mean,
it was my cousin, the chef,

00:26.407 --> 00:28.913
he came in early to
try out some new dishes.

00:28.943 --> 00:31.030
Why would you do that? You
guys are gonna change the menu?

00:31.060 --> 00:34.031
Well, the food sales haven't been
quite as brisk as the bar, so...

00:34.061 --> 00:35.383
thought we'd switch things up a little bit.

00:35.413 --> 00:38.023
- Is it paying off?
- Well, I mean, you tell me.

00:38.053 --> 00:40.984
The food's great, right? It's getting
the word out that's the problem.

00:41.014 --> 00:43.954
It's a shame, you know. Food
this good deserves attention.

00:43.984 --> 00:45.132
Yeah.

00:45.162 --> 00:47.325
You know what? I'm gonna
talk to David Fickler,

00:47.355 --> 00:48.913
the restaurant critic at my paper.

00:48.943 --> 00:51.858
Are you serious? You think you could
get him to review the restaurant?

00:51.888 --> 00:54.446
I mean, I can't make any promises, but...

00:54.476 --> 00:56.614
- He owes me a favour.
- Oh, my God, I've got to tell

00:56.644 --> 00:58.944
my cousin. It's gonna blow his mind.

00:59.557 --> 01:01.343
After breakfast of course.
I wouldn't want to interrupt

01:01.373 --> 01:02.918
this wonderful conversation
that we're all having.

01:02.948 --> 01:04.796
- Go, go, go!
- Thank you. You're amazing.

01:04.825 --> 01:07.193
Fantastic. That's wonderful.

01:08.022 --> 01:11.173

- Yo, it's open!
- Come on, man.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.536
Forget about it, let's go!

01:32.830 --> 01:34.883
Stop! Police!

01:36.192 --> 01:38.842
- Oh, jeez.
- Police! Hold it right there!

01:41.094 --> 01:42.574
Dispatch, we've got a 10-44

01:42.604 --> 01:46.780
at Clarkswell and Monument. I need a team.

01:49.148 --> 01:54.835
Sync & Corrections by Wolfen
www.addic7ed.com

02:09.277 --> 02:12.307
When I was a paramedic, I responded
to a lot of late-night calls out here.

02:12.337 --> 02:14.037
You don't want to be
wandering out here after dark.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.517
Not much better during day.

02:15.547 --> 02:18.022
- Hey, good timing.
- Do we have an ID?

02:18.052 --> 02:19.717
We do. Dental records are a match.

02:19.747 --> 02:23.401
Her name is Rachel Westbrooke, a
prominent psychiatrist in the city.

02:23.431 --> 02:26.245
- A long way from uptown.
- Anyone know she was missing?

02:26.275 --> 02:29.619
A colleague called it in when she didn't
show up for work a couple of days ago.

02:29.649 --> 02:33.644
And... judging by the state of
the body, she'd been in the trunk

02:33.674 --> 02:36.054
for most, if not all, of that time.

02:36.084 --> 02:37.776
A uniformed officer found the body

02:37.806 --> 02:39.876
when he was investigating
a B and E on the car.

02:39.906 --> 02:41.403
- Cause of death?
- She was stabbed

02:41.433 --> 02:42.683
multiple times in the abdomen.

02:42.713 --> 02:44.461
We'll know more when we
get the autopsy results.

02:44.491 --> 02:46.944
- This isn't her car, is it?
- No.

02:46.974 --> 02:49.710
The car belongs to a...

02:49.740 --> 02:51.813
Jason Varden.

02:51.843 --> 02:53.755
No relation to the victim
as far as we can tell,

02:53.785 --> 02:55.442
but we're still looking for him.

02:55.472 --> 02:57.525
Well, these parking
tickets date back a week,

02:57.555 --> 03:00.445
so the car must have been
here when the body was dumped.

03:00.475 --> 03:02.354
Murder weapon was a broken bottle.

03:02.384 --> 03:04.614
We found it in a trash can.

03:04.644 --> 03:06.556
- Any prints?
- Nothing useful,

03:06.586 --> 03:10.235
but I did rescue some personal
effects from the trunk though.

03:11.890 --> 03:14.380
Let's see: baseball glove,

03:14.410 --> 03:17.366
blankets, jumper cables,

03:17.753 --> 03:19.488
a pair of men's eyeglasses.

03:19.518 --> 03:21.039
None appear to belong to the victim.

03:21.069 --> 03:22.933
- What about a purse?
- Haven't found one yet.

03:22.963 --> 03:25.319
You think this was random?
Maybe a mugging gone wrong?

03:25.349 --> 03:27.340
Or someone wanted it to look that way.

03:27.370 --> 03:30.724
- Was she married?
- Unmarried. Parents deceased. No siblings.

03:30.754 --> 03:33.446
The colleague who called it in was...

03:34.058 --> 03:35.617
Dr. Mallory Kesler.

03:35.647 --> 03:38.265
I know of her. I'm a fan
of her book Mind-field.

03:38.295 --> 03:41.378
It examines how cell brain
activity relates to mental health.

03:41.408 --> 03:43.572
It was a total game changer.

03:46.052 --> 03:48.452
I know what to get you for Christmas.

03:57.090 --> 03:59.306
Here to see Dr. Kesler.

03:59.336 --> 04:01.095
Marcus, hi.

04:01.270 --> 04:04.220
Make yourself comfortable,
and I'll be right in.

04:04.756 --> 04:07.366
Thank you.

04:09.153 --> 04:11.168
Dr. Kesler, I'm Sergeant McCluskey.

04:11.198 --> 04:13.999
This is Special Consultant
Logan. We're with the IIB.

04:14.269 --> 04:16.322
Of course. You're here about Rachel.

04:16.351 --> 04:18.184
We just heard. It's...

04:18.214 --> 04:20.721
devastating to say the least.

04:20.752 --> 04:23.484
When she didn't show up for her sessions,

04:23.554 --> 04:25.505
Dr. Lowry and I, both feared the worst.

04:25.535 --> 04:27.425
Was it unusual for her to miss work?

04:27.455 --> 04:29.494
She's never missed a day
as long as I've known her.

04:29.524 --> 04:31.674
Many of our patients rely on routine.

04:32.263 --> 04:33.775
So Dr. Lowry and I have been

04:33.805 --> 04:35.844
covering her sessions as well as our own.

04:35.874 --> 04:38.205
Was that gentleman one of her patients?

04:38.235 --> 04:41.489
Yes, um... Marcus Simms.

04:41.519 --> 04:43.653
He's a lovely man.

04:43.688 --> 04:45.552
He's been with Dr. Westbrooke for years.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.892
I'm hoping I can help him move past this.

04:47.922 --> 04:50.361
You seem to be handling
this all pretty well.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.242
Not really.

04:52.272 --> 04:54.542
It's textbook abnegation.

04:55.278 --> 04:57.113
I'm still in denial.

04:57.452 --> 05:00.166
Do you know if Dr.
Westbrooke had any enemies?

05:00.196 --> 05:03.741
God, no. She was loved by everyone.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.265
Wish people respected me half as much

05:05.295 --> 05:07.287
as they respected her.

05:07.970 --> 05:11.644
- Were you two friends?
- Great friends.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.046
She had a really big heart.

05:14.113 --> 05:16.613
And I would have done anything for her.

05:17.679 --> 05:20.716
Your findings are solid.
You have to publish this.

05:20.746 --> 05:23.355
Thank you. You're the best.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.181
Was Dr. Lowry close with her as well?

05:28.211 --> 05:29.501
I really shouldn't speak for Nate.

05:29.531 --> 05:31.050
But he should be back
from lunch any minute,

05:31.080 --> 05:32.283
if you don't mind waiting.

05:32.313 --> 05:35.100
Yeah. Do you mind showing
us Dr. Westbrooke's office?

05:35.130 --> 05:37.344
No, not at all.

05:38.507 --> 05:40.475
Here you are.

05:40.859 --> 05:42.345
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.346
Thank you.

05:47.082 --> 05:49.060
No computer.

05:51.253 --> 05:54.647
Really, not much in the
way of personal effects.

05:59.856 --> 06:02.106
- What's that?
- Appointment book.

06:02.514 --> 06:05.689
Last entry the day she disappeared. "H.H."

06:05.719 --> 06:08.090
- That's it? Just the initials?
- Yeah.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.046
Pardon me.

06:10.076 --> 06:12.829
- I'm Dr. Nate Lowry.
- Toby Logan. IIB.

06:12.859 --> 06:15.859
Hi. Mallory mentioned that
you wanted to speak with me

06:15.893 --> 06:17.530
- about Rachel.
- Yeah. I'm so sorry

06:17.560 --> 06:19.233
- about your colleague.
- Thank you.

06:19.263 --> 06:21.695
Can you think of anyone who
may have wanted to harm her?

06:21.725 --> 06:24.122
No, no. She was an amazing woman.

06:24.152 --> 06:27.922
- Did you guys get along?
- Oh yeah, we were very close.

06:28.356 --> 06:31.191
- Your patients deserve better.
- You stay out of my business.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.259
This has nothing to do with you.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.120
Was there a recent argument?

06:38.150 --> 06:41.497
Everyone has disagreements
from time to time.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.563
Rachel was... She was very passionate.

06:44.593 --> 06:46.119
She was...

06:47.624 --> 06:49.597
I'm sorry, this is all very fresh.

06:49.627 --> 06:52.196
Do you have any idea why she was
in Parkdale last Friday evening?

06:52.226 --> 06:54.784
No. I can't imagine what
business brought her there.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.116
Do you know if she had a boyfriend?

06:56.146 --> 06:59.709
Rachel was married to her
work. It's all she had.

07:00.352 --> 07:01.953
Thank you.

07:08.664 --> 07:10.546
So you think Lowry's hiding something?

07:10.576 --> 07:14.017
He downplayed his relationship with
the victim. I'd say that qualifies.

07:14.051 --> 07:16.790
I spoke with the owner of
the car Westbrooke's body

07:16.820 --> 07:19.971
was found in. I confirmed he had
been out of town all week on business.

07:20.001 --> 07:22.275
He recognized all of the items
in the trunk except for one.

07:22.305 --> 07:24.515
Said he'd never seen the glasses.

07:24.834 --> 07:26.962
Okay, well, we know
Westbrooke didn't wear glasses,

07:26.996 --> 07:30.904
- so maybe they belonged to the killer.
- Sent to Alex for analysis.

07:30.934 --> 07:33.522
You find anything interesting
at Westbrooke's apartment?

07:33.552 --> 07:35.661
It's what we didn't find
that was the most interesting.

07:35.691 --> 07:37.651
There's no laptop, no cell phone.

07:37.681 --> 07:39.884
I did find this though.

07:40.075 --> 07:43.656
It's a phone list of Westbrooke's patients.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.202
- Look at this. Harvey Holden.
- H.H. That's Westbrooke's

07:47.232 --> 07:50.001
last appointment. You got
an address on this guy?

07:50.069 --> 07:52.675
Yeah. He's in an apartment
building on Fuller Avenue.

07:52.705 --> 07:55.210
- Near where the body was found.
- That's why she was there.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.495
- She was making a house call.
- Let's go.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.533
Oh! Well, well, well!

07:59.563 --> 08:01.825
Twice in one day. At this rate
I'll have to start charging you.

08:01.855 --> 08:03.417
I'm not eating.

08:03.447 --> 08:05.243
Oh, maybe I'll take a dessert
to go, but that's not why

08:05.273 --> 08:08.154
I came by. I wanted to give
you the good news in person.

08:08.184 --> 08:10.578
The critic? The critic is
coming to review the restaurant?

08:10.608 --> 08:12.088
The food critic's gonna
come review the restaurant.

08:12.118 --> 08:13.810
That's amazing! When's he coming?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.225
He's coming tomorrow, but I can't
give you any other information.

08:16.255 --> 08:17.764
What? No, no, I need details.

08:17.794 --> 08:18.943
- No.
- How he's look like?

08:18.973 --> 08:21.080
Does he have any allergies?
Will he accept a bribe?

08:21.110 --> 08:22.687
What's the going rate
for a bribe these days?

08:22.717 --> 08:23.733
Can I bribe him with a gift certificate?

08:23.763 --> 08:26.576
I've already said too much. Critics
like to be as anonymous as possible

08:26.606 --> 08:28.561
to make sure they get the real experience.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.557
Yeah, okay. Alright. But let me repay you.

08:31.592 --> 08:34.092
Please. You name it. Anything I can do!

08:34.472 --> 08:37.049
- Dessert menu.
- Yes, okay. Great! Rebecca,

08:37.080 --> 08:39.277
can you get this young lady all
of the tiramisu she wants, please?

08:39.307 --> 08:40.081
I don't want...

08:40.111 --> 08:42.063
- Ahmed!
- Okay...

08:48.625 --> 08:50.204
Thank you so much for taking the time

08:50.234 --> 08:51.513
to speak with us, Mr. Holden.

08:51.543 --> 08:55.842
No, I welcome the company.
Just watch your step.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.019
Excuse the mess.

08:58.049 --> 09:01.708
Since I left the
university, my books, art...

09:01.738 --> 09:05.522
and papers have become my only companions.

09:05.552 --> 09:09.952
Well, we're here to talk about one of
your other companions, Dr. Westbrooke.

09:09.995 --> 09:12.072
Something's happened to her, hasn't it?

09:12.102 --> 09:13.698
What makes you say that?

09:13.728 --> 09:16.668
She never misses our appointments.

09:17.602 --> 09:20.695
We found her in the trunk of a car.

09:22.318 --> 09:24.442
I'm sorry. I know this
must be very difficult.

09:25.471 --> 09:26.945
Difficult?

09:26.979 --> 09:30.135
I just lost the one person
that makes my life bearable.

09:30.353 --> 09:32.176
Were you pretty close to Dr. Westbrooke.

09:32.206 --> 09:34.001
She was my only friend.

09:36.424 --> 09:38.656
... Followed her every move...

09:47.460 --> 09:50.931
Did you ever hope for
anything more than friendship?

09:50.961 --> 09:53.683
No. Of course not. It wasn't like that.

09:56.145 --> 09:59.124
- That's private! Don't touch!
- What are you doing with this?

09:59.506 --> 10:01.411
There's nothing in here but Dr. Westbrooke.

10:01.445 --> 10:03.446
I followed her accomplishments.

10:04.647 --> 10:05.904
Do you wear glasses?

10:05.934 --> 10:08.701
Reading glasses. What does
that got to do with anything?

10:08.736 --> 10:11.907
I think we should continue this
conversation down at our office.

10:11.937 --> 10:13.819
Please. We were friends.

10:13.849 --> 10:15.745
She trusted me. I helped her with her work.

10:15.775 --> 10:18.812
You can come on your own accord
or we can get an arrest warrant.

10:18.846 --> 10:20.896
- The choice is yours.
- I can't. Please!

10:20.926 --> 10:22.279
Hey!

10:24.546 --> 10:26.758
- Please! Oh!
- Hey!

10:27.872 --> 10:30.196
Mr. Holden, come here. Sit down.

10:33.654 --> 10:35.861
When was the last time
you left your apartment?

10:36.234 --> 10:39.598
Five years.

10:39.666 --> 10:42.278
Don't worry, we're not
gonna make you go anywhere.

10:44.908 --> 10:47.606
There's no way that he
killed Dr. Westbrooke.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.275
He's agoraphobic.

10:59.184 --> 11:01.409
Autopsy report places her time of death

11:01.439 --> 11:04.333
around 50 hours, before her body was found.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.483
- Defensive wounds?
- None.

11:07.513 --> 11:10.006
She likely didn't see the killer
coming until it was too late.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.776
Or she knew her killer,
and her guard was down.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.532
The results on the glasses are
back. The lenses are prescription,

11:15.562 --> 11:17.528
so the owner probably wore them regularly.

11:17.558 --> 11:19.415
- Fingerprints?
- There was a partial,

11:19.445 --> 11:21.209
but we couldn't find it in the database.

11:21.239 --> 11:25.921
So unless one of our suspects starts
bumping into walls, we have nothing.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.323
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.818
Let's go.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.390
Hey guys, wait up, I got something for you.

11:33.742 --> 11:35.259
A killer wrapped in a bow?

11:35.289 --> 11:37.762
Nothing as extravagant,
but I think you'll like it.

11:37.796 --> 11:40.131
- Bank statements?
- Yeah. I did some digging

11:40.165 --> 11:42.299
on Dr. Lowry. Turns out
he has a private account

11:42.334 --> 11:44.015
set up for just one specific transaction.

11:44.045 --> 11:47.338
- Where's the money coming from?
- Cooper-Weiss Pharmaceuticals.

11:47.372 --> 11:49.469
Yeah. They've been making
the same monthly deposit

11:49.499 --> 11:51.342
into that account for the past 26 months.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.344
Sounds like they have
Lowry in their back pocket.

11:53.378 --> 11:55.479
- If Westbrooke found out...
- Then that might explain

11:55.514 --> 11:58.349
- the argument that you saw.
- Right. Exactly. That, my friends,

11:58.383 --> 12:00.522
- is what you call motive.
- Well, let's go see

12:00.552 --> 12:02.400
if Lowry's partnership
with the drug company

12:02.430 --> 12:05.195
was a deal worth killing over. Thanks, Dev.

12:06.024 --> 12:08.625
What exactly is it that
you're accusing me of here?

12:08.660 --> 12:10.423
We just wanna ask you a couple of questions

12:10.453 --> 12:13.664
about your relationship with
Cooper-Weiss pharmaceuticals.

12:14.335 --> 12:15.545
Wouldn't your time be better spent

12:15.575 --> 12:17.502
looking into Dr. Westbrooke's murder?

12:17.532 --> 12:19.523
This is part of that investigation.

12:19.553 --> 12:22.855
What could my private financial
dealings possibly have to do with it?

12:22.890 --> 12:25.158
Wish she'd never found out about it.

12:25.510 --> 12:28.260
Can you tell us about the monthly payments.

12:29.967 --> 12:32.026
I'm not doing anything illegal.

12:32.056 --> 12:35.100
And that's all I care to say on
the matter without a lawyer present.

12:36.837 --> 12:40.439
I'm changing your prescription
to something more effective.

12:43.417 --> 12:46.145
Cooper-Weiss manufactures
Dinoxipan, don't they?

12:46.931 --> 12:49.945
See, we know that you've
been shilling for them.

12:51.253 --> 12:54.286
It's the new wonder drug, especially suited

12:54.320 --> 12:57.035
to easing the symptoms
of anxiety and depression.

12:57.065 --> 12:59.091
Some new drugs need an extra push

12:59.125 --> 13:02.027
to get to a wider market.
But I would never prescribe it

13:02.062 --> 13:03.995
to any patient who
wouldn't benefit from it.

13:04.064 --> 13:06.974
No, of course. You're just
thinking about your patients, right?

13:07.004 --> 13:08.967
This has nothing to do
with your bank account.

13:09.001 --> 13:12.170
Dr. Westbrooke found out about
this arrangement, didn't she?

13:12.714 --> 13:15.707
This is the professional
disagreement you mentioned.

13:16.402 --> 13:18.410
She objected on ethical grounds,

13:18.440 --> 13:20.583
but I wasn't breaking any laws.

13:20.613 --> 13:22.841
She was... disappointed.

13:22.871 --> 13:26.826
- Does Dr. Kesler know about this arrangement.
- If she did, I'd have heard.

13:26.856 --> 13:28.853
- Why is that?
- She dedicated

13:28.888 --> 13:31.774
an entire chapter of her book
to her belief that big pharma

13:31.804 --> 13:33.925
are the bottom-feeders
of the medical world.

13:33.959 --> 13:38.721
She equates them to parasites.
For me, it's just business.

13:39.290 --> 13:41.870
Okay, those are good. I would
do those limes a little thinner.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.259
Hey Rebecca, what's with
the... The back of your hair

13:44.289 --> 13:45.807
looks like, I don't know, it
looks like someone sat on it.

13:45.837 --> 13:47.354
You know what? Why don't
you focus on your own hair.

13:47.384 --> 13:50.057
- Whoa! Rude.
- Okay. You look like Elvis... Elvis

13:50.124 --> 13:52.030
- I was going for. I'm sorry.
- Elvis.

13:52.060 --> 13:54.456
It's not... It's just the stress
of the situation. I'm sorry.

13:54.486 --> 13:55.963
Hey, Oz, what's up?

13:55.997 --> 13:58.031
I'll tell you what's up.
You're a crime reporter, right?

13:58.099 --> 14:00.962
I'd like to report a crime.
A crime that your food critic

14:00.992 --> 14:02.887
does not have a single picture
of himself on the internet.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.594
I told you, he likes to stay anonymous.

14:04.624 --> 14:07.240
I bet he does. I also found
out every new restaurant

14:07.308 --> 14:09.965
he gave a bad review to
shut down within 3 months.

14:09.995 --> 14:12.217
Maybe this is a bad
idea. Why don't you call

14:12.247 --> 14:14.401
the whole thing off? Tell
him I changed my mind.

14:14.431 --> 14:19.102
- It doesn't work like that.
- Oh, God. What do I do here?

14:19.136 --> 14:20.717
What about a grease fire?

14:20.747 --> 14:22.142
You know what I mean? Start a
little grease fire in the kitchen?

14:22.172 --> 14:25.742
Shut down the place for 3 weeks?
Lay low. Reopen as a hookah bar.

14:25.809 --> 14:29.001
Huh? Or a sweat shop. No
one reviews sweat shops.

14:29.031 --> 14:32.385
Oz, you're being... Oz.

14:32.767 --> 14:34.457
Did you just use my name as an adjective

14:34.487 --> 14:37.720
to describe what I'm doing right
now? I'm a little insulted by that.

14:37.754 --> 14:42.358
- Also a little flattered actually.
- Sit down. Come sit.

14:42.388 --> 14:44.007
- Just...
- Use watch it with the napkins, please.

14:44.037 --> 14:45.107
- Okay?
- No.

14:45.137 --> 14:46.995
- Fork is a little dusty.
- Just put it down. Put down the fork.

14:47.030 --> 14:50.140
Take a deep breath. You
have nothing to worry about.

14:50.170 --> 14:51.836
Your menu is wonderful.

14:51.866 --> 14:54.573
Your place is wonderful.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.310
We gotta change it. Rebecca,
we gotta change all this.

14:57.340 --> 14:59.424
- Change what?
- This. Are you blind?

14:59.454 --> 15:01.960
I'm sorry, but all of this
needs to change. Immediately.

15:02.028 --> 15:04.982
- Please. I said please. Right?
- Yeah.

15:05.012 --> 15:05.934
It's not you, it's me.

15:05.964 --> 15:08.014
Clearly. Right? It's not
your issue. I'm sorry.

15:08.044 --> 15:10.688
What I said about your hair, that was rude.

15:12.204 --> 15:15.654
You stare at the screen so
long without going cross-eyed?

15:16.322 --> 15:17.842
I guess that's my superpower.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.728
It's not as cool as yours, sure, but...

15:20.758 --> 15:23.618
You find anything suspicious
on any of the security cams?

15:23.648 --> 15:25.477
Nothing that points to our killer, but

15:25.507 --> 15:28.219
I was able to confirm something.

15:30.986 --> 15:34.545
Okay, there. That is Westbrooke
leaving Bloordale Station,

15:34.575 --> 15:37.081
- 8:40 pm last Friday.
- She has a bag with her.

15:37.111 --> 15:39.451
Which more than likely
contains a wallet, cell phone,

15:39.481 --> 15:41.986
laptop. And since we didn't
find them at the crime scene,

15:42.016 --> 15:44.017
there's a high probability
that the killer took them.

15:44.051 --> 15:46.423
Oh, hey, ooh. Can you freeze the image?

15:46.453 --> 15:48.407
Guy right there. I recognize that guy.

15:48.437 --> 15:50.103
That's Marcus.

15:50.636 --> 15:53.548
The patient from Kesler's office.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.548
Marcus, can you explain to us

15:59.583 --> 16:02.752
what you were doing at the Bloordale
Station, last Friday evening?

16:02.786 --> 16:05.388
I, uh, I don't remember.

16:05.422 --> 16:08.380
It'll be okay, Nick promised...

16:08.410 --> 16:10.910
Just tell them the truth
and they'll let me go...

16:10.944 --> 16:14.613
You weren't alone, were you?
Was someone else with you?

16:16.499 --> 16:18.638
I, I don't know.

16:18.668 --> 16:21.188
I don't know anything.

16:21.218 --> 16:25.707
Shut up. Trying to help.
It's okay. Shut up. It's okay.

16:35.985 --> 16:39.121
- Dr. Kesler I presume.
- You must be Detective Becker.

16:39.188 --> 16:41.494
Staff Inspector actually. This way.

16:41.524 --> 16:43.929
I just got word that one of my
patients, Marcus Simms, was picked up

16:43.959 --> 16:45.950
and brought here for
questioning. Is that accurate?

16:45.980 --> 16:47.813
I cannot divulge that information.

16:47.843 --> 16:50.149
Well, if it is true, you need
to release him immediately.

16:50.179 --> 16:52.651
Whatever information you get
from him won't hold up in court.

16:52.681 --> 16:55.153
Why is that exactly?

16:55.183 --> 16:58.385
I told you that I don't know anything.

16:58.415 --> 17:00.940
Okay, I don't know why
you won't listen to me.

17:00.970 --> 17:03.421
I want to show you something.

17:04.792 --> 17:07.795
That is you in the
security footage, is it not?

17:08.814 --> 17:10.549
I can't do it. I'm so confused.

17:10.579 --> 17:13.411
Shut up. Please, help me.
It's okay... I need. It's okay.

17:13.441 --> 17:15.352
It's okay.

17:22.777 --> 17:25.045
Look, I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

17:26.756 --> 17:30.016
Pathetic little whiner. I
should've dealt with this

17:30.084 --> 17:31.764
myself from the start.

17:31.794 --> 17:33.958
We're not talking to
Marcus anymore, are we?

17:34.688 --> 17:37.289
You got that right, buddy boy.

17:42.015 --> 17:44.352
Dissociative identity disorder.

17:45.617 --> 17:47.617
It's quite a mouthful, Doctor.

17:47.952 --> 17:51.254
It used to be known as
multiple personality disorder.

17:51.284 --> 17:53.121
In Marcus's case, he appears to cycle

17:53.151 --> 17:55.329
between 3 distinct personalities.

17:55.359 --> 17:57.916
That's interesting. We're
only aware of 2 so far.

17:58.441 --> 18:01.381
And this is real? This
is not some kind of hoax?

18:01.449 --> 18:03.487
The brain is a complicated machine.

18:03.936 --> 18:06.519
There have been D.I.D
studies that show one persona

18:06.554 --> 18:08.605
can be addicted to drugs,
while a second persona

18:08.635 --> 18:11.534
shows no signs of addiction or withdrawal.

18:11.564 --> 18:14.681
- That is incredible.
- But extremely stressful.

18:14.711 --> 18:17.530
So I'm sure you can understand why
you need to release him immediately.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.172
No, no, no, no. Hold on a second here.

18:20.202 --> 18:22.308
None of this changes
the fact that Mr. Simms

18:22.338 --> 18:24.788
is a suspect in a murder investigation.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.206
Marcus is a sick man,

18:27.236 --> 18:29.896
but he's not capable of this.

18:30.255 --> 18:31.949
Even if he's innocent,

18:31.979 --> 18:33.635
it's possible that he may have witnessed

18:33.665 --> 18:36.386
- whoever did kill your partner.
- I was a paramedic, alright,

18:36.416 --> 18:38.355
I dealt with emotionally
distressed people every day.

18:38.356 --> 18:39.483
I know I can get through to him.

18:39.790 --> 18:43.271
I'm sorry, but Marcus is
in a very fragile state.

18:43.305 --> 18:45.707
Pushing him too far could
cause him to withdraw

18:45.741 --> 18:47.474
into a catatonic state. I can't allow that.

18:47.504 --> 18:49.522
And if I have to declare
him a material witness

18:49.552 --> 18:52.103
to keep him here, I will do so.

18:52.137 --> 18:53.829
Do I need to get a judge to intervene here?

18:53.859 --> 18:56.008
Alright, let's step back a little bit

18:56.038 --> 18:59.210
and let's think what's the
best thing for Marcus here.

18:59.434 --> 19:02.172
And I know I can get through to him.

19:04.333 --> 19:07.989
Okay. But I want to be
present at all times.

19:08.019 --> 19:09.841
If I feel he's being pushed too far,

19:09.871 --> 19:12.556
I will put a stop to the proceedings.

19:17.654 --> 19:20.630
I'm gonna get a warrant,
check out this Marcus's place.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.133
Get Dev down there, see if he
can't find the murder weapon,

19:23.167 --> 19:26.207
Westbrooke's computer,
anything that's gonna link him

19:26.237 --> 19:28.092
- to having killed her.
- On it.

19:28.122 --> 19:29.910
Thank you.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.897
Hey, watch out. Come here.

19:33.927 --> 19:36.218
Come on. Hey, come on, come on.

19:36.248 --> 19:38.898
Come on, move it. What did they order?

19:40.424 --> 19:44.187
"Bank wankel"? Did you have a
stroke while you were writing this?

19:44.224 --> 19:46.225
- They want drinks and appys.
- Yeah, that's what you think.

19:46.294 --> 19:48.088
They just want drinks and appys.
Maybe that's their whole plan.

19:48.677 --> 19:50.506
Wait for us to lower our guard,
then BAM! They order the mains.

19:50.536 --> 19:54.419
They want substitutions food
allergies. No, no, no. Not on my watch.

19:54.449 --> 19:56.149
Can I go now?

19:57.096 --> 19:58.164
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Thank you.

19:58.194 --> 20:02.284
- Sorry about the hair thing from earlier.
- It's not a problem.

20:04.259 --> 20:05.903
Hi, how are you? How can I help you today?

20:05.933 --> 20:08.666
- I'll take a menu please.
- Sure, no problem. My pleasure.

20:09.455 --> 20:10.838
There you go.

20:10.868 --> 20:14.538
Actually, I hand stained
those myself from balsa wood.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.673
Yeah, we do everything artisanal here.

20:17.703 --> 20:20.447
You enjoy that, take your time
with that. A lot to take in.

20:20.477 --> 20:21.515
Thank you.

20:23.621 --> 20:25.281
Come to see your man in action?

20:25.311 --> 20:27.245
- Sorry?
- Hey, don't be coy. The jig is up.

20:27.280 --> 20:30.176
I spotted your boy the
second he wandered in here.

20:30.206 --> 20:31.884
- I'm just here for some dinner.
- Oh, sure!

20:31.951 --> 20:33.664
Go ahead. Eat whatever
you want on the house,

20:33.694 --> 20:37.088
of course, just stay out of my way.

20:37.118 --> 20:39.405
I've got a critic to impress.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.018
Are you thirsty? You look thirsty.

20:46.048 --> 20:48.383
Why does this man not have
a drink menu in front of him?

20:51.938 --> 20:53.376
Marcus, we need to ask you

20:53.406 --> 20:57.342
some further questions regarding
your whereabouts Friday evening.

20:57.998 --> 21:00.712
Ask away, beautiful.

21:00.967 --> 21:02.948
Marcus, take it easy.

21:02.982 --> 21:05.183
If you ever want to take a
break, you just let us know.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.120
Always calling me that. I hate that name.

21:08.154 --> 21:10.652
So, are we talking to Nick?

21:10.682 --> 21:12.699
Yeah. What?

21:12.966 --> 21:15.184
Nick, I'm Special Consultant Toby Logan.

21:15.214 --> 21:16.732
This is Sergeant Michelle McCluskey.

21:16.762 --> 21:18.763
We've got a few questions for you.

21:21.399 --> 21:23.968
Were you following Dr. Westbrooke?

21:24.318 --> 21:27.270
No. Why would I do that?

21:27.300 --> 21:29.940
This is a waste of time.
What he was thinking?

21:29.970 --> 21:33.018
I told him to knock off
the sneaking around crap.

21:33.048 --> 21:34.931
Alright, so maybe it wasn't you.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.952
Maybe it was someone close to you.

21:36.982 --> 21:39.077
Is there someone else
we can speak to, Nick?

21:39.107 --> 21:42.355
Someone who might have seen
what happened to Dr. Westbrooke?

21:47.918 --> 21:51.700
What did you do?

21:52.438 --> 21:54.530
No. There's just me.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.070
And I told you, I didn't see anything.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.497
Are you sure?

21:59.466 --> 22:02.855
Because someone has Dr.
Westbrooke's blood on their hands.

22:02.885 --> 22:05.095
Are you sure it's not you, Nick?

22:06.579 --> 22:07.780
All right, I think that's enough.

22:07.810 --> 22:09.041
Wait.

22:12.544 --> 22:16.564
Can't tell them. Shut up! It'll be
Okay. Can't let him out. Can't tell them.

22:20.621 --> 22:22.386
That was impressive.

22:22.912 --> 22:26.443
I've never seen Nick back
down like that before.

22:26.473 --> 22:29.261
- Marcus?
- Sam.

22:29.753 --> 22:31.404
It's nice to meet you.

22:31.888 --> 22:34.538
I wish it were under better circumstances.

22:35.538 --> 22:36.991
Sam, we need to know

22:37.021 --> 22:39.908
why you were following Dr. Westbrooke.

22:39.975 --> 22:42.720
Um... I was...

22:43.091 --> 22:45.360
very fond of Dr. Westbrooke.

22:46.953 --> 22:50.053
- I wanted to protect her.
- Protect her from what?

22:50.217 --> 22:53.187
Well, the world is a terrifying place.

22:53.255 --> 22:56.023
I keep it from the others, but I've seen

22:56.091 --> 22:59.070
horrible things my whole life.

22:59.559 --> 23:02.296
Dr. Westbrooke had an
appointment down there.

23:03.026 --> 23:04.450
And I know what can happen.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.701
It's a... it's a dangerous neighbourhood.

23:08.478 --> 23:12.156
I was supposed to be her
guardian angel. I failed her.

23:12.363 --> 23:14.541
Did you see what happened to her?

23:14.765 --> 23:15.789
No.

23:18.407 --> 23:22.160
Nick disapproves of my concerns.

23:22.353 --> 23:25.201
If he catches me, he pushes me under.

23:25.231 --> 23:27.809
What does that mean? To be pushed under?

23:27.839 --> 23:29.940
It's kind of hard to describe.

23:30.362 --> 23:32.843
It's like being paralyzed in a storm.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.788
I can hear voices and see shadows

23:35.818 --> 23:40.385
on the other side but I can't
move, I can't communicate.

23:40.415 --> 23:44.935
Sam, you said that you
cared about Dr. Westbrooke.

23:45.321 --> 23:47.642
We need help speaking to Marcus.

23:47.672 --> 23:49.692
Can you help us, Sam, please?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.578
Do this for Dr. Westbrooke.

23:51.608 --> 23:54.897
I should talk to them. No.
Let him talk, it'll be Okay.

23:54.932 --> 23:57.066
Stay out of it.

24:04.330 --> 24:05.808
- Marcus?
- Hmm?

24:06.763 --> 24:09.314
Did you see who killed Dr. Westbrooke?

24:09.676 --> 24:11.682
He might've seen. He might've done it.

24:11.712 --> 24:13.215
No. He's not like that.

24:13.283 --> 24:15.900
You don't know that. I
know him. Everyone has a...

24:15.930 --> 24:19.654
It's okay. Marcus, you can tell
us what happened. What did you see?

24:19.689 --> 24:20.768
- No.
- Shut up!

24:20.798 --> 24:22.894
- It's safe.
- Not happening.

24:23.859 --> 24:26.332
No, uh... Sh-sh-sh!
He might have seen.

24:26.362 --> 24:28.464
- Who killed Dr. Westbrooke?
- He might have done it.

24:28.498 --> 24:30.866
- What happened?
- I...

24:31.557 --> 24:33.802
- What happened?
- No, no, no, no.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.705
Please stop this now.
It's too much for him.

24:36.739 --> 24:38.239
Marcus?

24:38.378 --> 24:40.480
He didn't mean to do it!

24:40.751 --> 24:42.330
He would never,

24:42.523 --> 24:43.747
ever hurt her on purpose!

24:43.777 --> 24:46.081
- You don't know that.
- Marcus, who?

24:46.115 --> 24:49.421
- Marcus, please.
- Marcus, who?

24:49.880 --> 24:52.286
Marcus, please.

24:53.032 --> 24:54.605
It's Ok, Marcus. Who wouldn't hurt her?

24:54.635 --> 24:57.125
No! Okay?

25:00.064 --> 25:01.636
He's not here.

25:02.245 --> 25:05.333
Marcus is not coming
back out to play anymore,

25:06.200 --> 25:09.538
Okay? This is over.

25:09.805 --> 25:10.971
Okay.

25:12.540 --> 25:13.578
It's Okay.

25:14.660 --> 25:15.710
We're done.

25:16.507 --> 25:17.907
Yeah.

25:30.016 --> 25:32.030
So, what did you find at Marcus's?

25:32.377 --> 25:34.446
It's Marcus living there, but there's...

25:34.476 --> 25:37.373
3 different bedrooms. As you can
see, they're all totally different.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.952
It's like 3 different people live there.

25:38.982 --> 25:40.536
All the beds have been slept in.

25:40.566 --> 25:43.867
And there's even another
pillow and blanket on the couch.

25:43.897 --> 25:47.020
It's gonna be difficult. It's like
having a time share in your own body.

25:47.050 --> 25:49.878
- Anything else?
- Yeah. I found a pair of jeans

25:49.908 --> 25:52.200
with bloodstains, they
were wadded up and thrown

25:52.230 --> 25:53.742
behind a bunch of junk in the basement.

25:53.772 --> 25:56.422
I've got Alex analyzing them as we speak.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.692
So this guy might be our killer.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.240
You gotta be straight with us here, Nick.

26:05.758 --> 26:08.316
Do you know who killed Dr. Westbrooke?

26:09.431 --> 26:12.081
I already told you. I don't know anything.

26:14.446 --> 26:16.478
Idiot! What did you do?

26:17.974 --> 26:19.924
You hid her body, didn't you?

26:20.105 --> 26:23.751
- You put her in that trunk.
- No.

26:35.068 --> 26:36.668
Yeah, I think you did.

26:37.415 --> 26:39.544
I think you know who killed Dr. Westbrooke.

26:39.574 --> 26:42.270
- You're wrong.
- You saw who did it.

26:42.300 --> 26:45.050
- You're wrong.
- Who killed her?

26:45.080 --> 26:47.465
You're wrong!

26:48.211 --> 26:51.232
What did you see, Nick? Nick?

26:51.262 --> 26:53.358
Stop this now, or I will.

26:53.892 --> 26:56.058
- Okay.
- What did you see?

26:56.384 --> 26:58.876
Who did it?

27:00.094 --> 27:01.227
- Tell me.
- Hey.

27:01.257 --> 27:03.634
- What?
- It's Okay, Nick.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.716
- We're done for now.
- What?

27:11.450 --> 27:14.007
You must know that nothing
he says is reliable.

27:14.037 --> 27:16.324
The man was clearly under extreme duress.

27:16.354 --> 27:18.324
We're just trying to establish a timeline.

27:18.354 --> 27:20.868
You're confusing him in an
effort to elicit a confession.

27:20.898 --> 27:22.513
- No, that's not true.
- Before you start

27:22.543 --> 27:24.333
throwing around
accusations, you should know

27:24.368 --> 27:27.351
that earlier we found bloody
clothing in Marcus's apartment.

27:27.381 --> 27:30.131
That blood was a match
for Dr. Westbrooke's.

27:30.477 --> 27:33.069
In light of this development,
I'm still gonna set the wheels

27:33.099 --> 27:36.291
in motion to have Marcus moved to a
mental health facility as soon as possible.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.712
Doctor, there are still a
lot of unanswered questions.

27:38.742 --> 27:41.339
We're trying to solve
your partner's murder here.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.390
- You think I've forgotten that?
- Well...

27:43.420 --> 27:46.314
Right now, my responsibility
is to protect Marcus.

27:46.344 --> 27:47.982
If he is persecuted any further,

27:48.012 --> 27:50.889
I promise you there will be repercussions.

27:53.964 --> 27:56.901
I'm getting through to him. I
just need more time in there.

27:56.931 --> 27:58.192
He's mentally unstable.

27:58.222 --> 28:00.169
If I can't arrest him, he
needs to be institutionalized.

28:00.203 --> 28:03.553
My reads aren't adding up.
We're just missing something.

28:03.864 --> 28:06.718
Well, you said yourself. You saw he had
blood on his hands. I presume that...

28:06.748 --> 28:10.178
I didn't see him kill her. If he
did it, why is that piece missing?

28:10.213 --> 28:12.198
I just need to dig a little deeper.

28:12.228 --> 28:15.328
If for no other reason
than to support your theory.

28:15.904 --> 28:16.995
You support this play?

28:17.025 --> 28:19.386
Absolutely. I trust Toby completely.

28:19.416 --> 28:21.455
If he thinks that Marcus
wasn't capable of this,

28:21.489 --> 28:23.852
he would be the first
one to put a stop to it.

28:24.446 --> 28:27.717
Why do I feel like the
inmates are running the asylum?

28:28.978 --> 28:30.224
Fine.

28:31.323 --> 28:33.845
I'll stall Kesler as long as I can.

28:34.276 --> 28:35.833
Time's ticking.

28:40.841 --> 28:43.993
So here's a timeline of when
each of Marcus's personalities

28:44.023 --> 28:47.582
were active during the 2 hours
surrounding Dr. Westbrooke's murder.

28:47.612 --> 28:50.372
Between the video surveillance
of Sam following Westbrooke

28:50.402 --> 28:54.236
and my read of Nick seeing the
body, there's a 30-minute gap.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.186
And somewhere in here, one of his
personas must have seen the murder.

28:57.216 --> 28:58.230
Maybe.

28:58.557 --> 29:00.499
But Dr. Kesler says it's not uncommon

29:00.529 --> 29:02.749
for folks with D.I.D. to completely block

29:02.779 --> 29:05.812
traumatic events out of their
mind. It's like a defence mechanism.

29:05.842 --> 29:07.988
Let's just hope that
last piece of the puzzle

29:08.018 --> 29:09.985
actually comes bubbling to the surface.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.645
- Let's hope. Can I see the...
- Yeah!

29:11.675 --> 29:14.171
... the photos of
Marcus's house? Thank you.

29:14.423 --> 29:17.463
So, the results came back on
the partial print on the glasses.

29:17.493 --> 29:19.042
They're pretty sure it belongs to Marcus.

29:19.072 --> 29:22.186
- Very well. It's another mystery put to bed.
- Maybe not.

29:22.216 --> 29:24.777
According to his licence,
his vision is 20-20.

29:24.807 --> 29:27.854
Of course, the licence expired 5 years ago.

29:27.884 --> 29:30.297
Well, his vision could have
deteriorated since then.

29:30.327 --> 29:32.707
I didn't see him wearing
glasses in any of my reads.

29:32.737 --> 29:34.181
And with a prescription that heavy,

29:34.211 --> 29:36.552
it would be hard to fake
your way through without them.

29:36.582 --> 29:38.432
So what are you suggesting?

29:40.881 --> 29:43.281
Maybe they're someone else's glasses.

29:43.708 --> 29:46.821
I think I just figured something out.
I need to speak to Marcus first, though.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.326
- Alright. I'll talk to Kesler.
- No, no, no.

29:48.356 --> 29:49.972
I want to speak to him alone.

29:50.002 --> 29:53.652
Dr. Kesler's not gonna let me
go as far as I might need to go.

29:55.661 --> 29:57.961
I need you to trust me on this one.

30:05.245 --> 30:06.891
Are you comfortable?

30:07.440 --> 30:08.877
You need anything?

30:08.907 --> 30:11.407
I need to get the hell out of this box.

30:12.864 --> 30:15.752
Must be hard protecting
the others like you do.

30:15.782 --> 30:17.532
You think it's by choice?

30:17.684 --> 30:20.331
I'm the only one around
here with any sense.

30:20.361 --> 30:22.255
Is that why you hid the body?

30:22.285 --> 30:25.185
To protect the person
you think who killed her?

30:26.024 --> 30:28.274
Someone else was there that night.

30:29.272 --> 30:30.906
Someone else you're pushing under.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.397
Can't let him out. He'll
take us all down with him.

30:34.955 --> 30:38.805
Dr. Kesler thinks there's three
of you, but that's not true is it?

30:40.352 --> 30:43.783
You see I think there's one, two, three,

30:44.052 --> 30:45.611
four of you.

30:45.806 --> 30:47.880
Who sleeps on the couch?

30:48.484 --> 30:50.315
Who's the fourth person, Nick?

30:51.739 --> 30:54.419
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:59.412 --> 31:01.662
We found these at the crime scene.

31:02.154 --> 31:04.098
Who do they belong to?

31:09.151 --> 31:12.151
I hope to hell you know
what you're doing, Logan.

31:12.992 --> 31:14.667
Does he want to come out?

31:14.697 --> 31:16.547
Does he want to talk to me?

31:19.038 --> 31:20.862
There's no one else.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.468
Nick, look.

31:24.498 --> 31:26.484
The amount of evidence that
we have gathered against you

31:26.518 --> 31:28.822
right now you look pretty good for murder.

31:29.875 --> 31:32.237
So you're either gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison

31:32.267 --> 31:34.091
or a mental facility.

31:34.670 --> 31:37.773
Now, what if the person that
you're protecting didn't do it?

31:37.803 --> 31:40.033
What if they saw what happened

31:40.063 --> 31:42.290
and they could point us
towards the real killer,

31:42.320 --> 31:44.510
that could clear your name.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.996
You're trying to trick me.

31:48.529 --> 31:50.036
I'm not.

31:51.206 --> 31:53.252
Think about it. You're a smart man.

31:53.282 --> 31:55.142
What do you got to lose?

31:57.351 --> 31:58.820
Let him out.

31:59.260 --> 32:01.364
I'm telling you, don't do this.

32:01.394 --> 32:04.096
I need to tell. We have
to. It's the only way.

32:04.126 --> 32:06.715
Let me talk. Tell them.

32:07.872 --> 32:11.127
- You want your glasses?
- Where...?

32:13.183 --> 32:14.532
There you are.

32:16.941 --> 32:19.302
Ah. It's better.

32:21.505 --> 32:23.542
I am Special Consultant Toby Logan.

32:23.572 --> 32:26.578
- Henry.
- Nice to meet you, Henry.

32:26.875 --> 32:30.144
Nick, Sam and Marcus were
trying to protect you.

32:30.174 --> 32:31.518
Why?

32:31.731 --> 32:34.450
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.018
- I'll deal with it.
- Thank you.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.382
Dr. Kesler, can I help you with something?

32:51.412 --> 32:52.568
Where's Marcus?

32:52.598 --> 32:54.403
The paperwork is in order,
and I was told he'd be ready

32:54.437 --> 32:56.673
for transfer in 10 minutes.
That was 30 minutes ago.

32:56.703 --> 32:58.118
Why don't you have a seat
in our conference room?

32:58.148 --> 33:00.849
I don't want to have a
seat. I want my patient. Now.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.822
It's just gonna be a few more minutes.

33:03.030 --> 33:06.542
You're still questioning him
aren't you? You have no right.

33:06.572 --> 33:09.851
- I'm gonna put a stop to this.
- Look, we've identified a fourth persona

33:09.919 --> 33:12.488
that Marcus has been hiding,
and we believe he may be the key

33:12.518 --> 33:14.666
to figuring out who killed Dr. Westbrooke.

33:14.696 --> 33:16.757
So we are going to
continue questioning him.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.880
Why don't you have a seat?

33:25.147 --> 33:27.547
Henry, I want you to think carefully.

33:28.992 --> 33:31.742
Did you see what happened
to Dr. Westbrooke?

33:32.178 --> 33:33.478
Where you there?

33:35.544 --> 33:36.544
I...

33:37.785 --> 33:39.844
I used to spend time in the area.

33:39.874 --> 33:43.824
There was a Shawarma joint
down there that I really like.

33:44.091 --> 33:48.092
And I was mega-hungry so I
guess I came to the front.

33:48.815 --> 33:52.899
But I couldn't find my glasses,
they were in the wrong pocket. So...

33:54.055 --> 33:56.797
all I really saw were shapes and...

33:57.727 --> 34:00.127
I saw someone coming after a woman...

34:08.161 --> 34:09.545
What else?

34:09.946 --> 34:12.246
Did you see the face of the killer?

34:15.060 --> 34:16.870
Not at first.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.474
Not until I put my glasses on.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.123
Dr. Kesler...

34:35.766 --> 34:37.802
Okay, well, thank you Henry.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.954
You don't know how close I came
to pulling the plug in there.

34:42.984 --> 34:45.226
I'm glad you didn't cuz
I saw what Henry saw.

34:45.255 --> 34:47.255
He didn't kill Dr. Westbrooke.

34:47.427 --> 34:49.014
So you're saying we're back to square one?

34:49.043 --> 34:52.516
Not at all. I saw the killer's face.

34:52.983 --> 34:55.387
It was Dr. Kesler.

35:00.221 --> 35:02.807
So you're saying that
Westbrooke's own partner

35:02.837 --> 35:06.099
- who actually killed her?
- That's what Marcus saw. Yeah.

35:06.129 --> 35:07.983
The Nick persona just saw the body

35:08.013 --> 35:10.813
and thought the Henry
persona had killed her.

35:11.445 --> 35:13.968
That's why Sam and Nick
were trying to protect Henry.

35:13.998 --> 35:16.390
I see now why the good doctor was so intent

35:16.420 --> 35:18.320
on getting him out of here.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.939
Well, let's go see what
she has to say for herself.

35:27.467 --> 35:29.531
I hope you're ready to release my patient.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.885
No. Not quite. We've made
a breakthrough with him.

35:32.915 --> 35:37.315
We think that he can help us close this
case. Have a seat, we'll fill you in.

35:38.459 --> 35:39.966
I don't see how that's possible.

35:39.996 --> 35:42.140
It turns out there's a fourth personality.

35:42.170 --> 35:45.920
And that persona witnessed the
murder and saw the killer's face.

35:52.070 --> 35:54.805
You have to understand that nothing he says

35:54.835 --> 35:57.723
can be assumed to be truthful.
He's an extremely disturbed man.

35:57.753 --> 36:01.578
Well, he was able to describe
the entire scene in great detail.

36:01.608 --> 36:03.478
And who did he suggest was the killer?

36:03.508 --> 36:07.548
I think you know. You pretended to
care about his well-being, didn't you?

36:07.578 --> 36:09.629
You just wanted to see how much he knew.

36:09.659 --> 36:11.045
What are you talking about?

36:11.075 --> 36:13.674
It was you who killed Dr. Westbrooke.

36:14.371 --> 36:16.795
- That's ridiculous.
- Why'd you do it?

36:17.735 --> 36:21.847
I'm sorry but my research completely
contradicts the main thesis of your book.

36:21.877 --> 36:25.777
Your conclusions were irresponsible.
People need to know the truth.

36:28.543 --> 36:30.540
Look, I'm telling you,

36:30.794 --> 36:32.948
I didn't kill her.

36:33.389 --> 36:34.789
She was my friend.

36:35.949 --> 36:39.294
Making it look like a random
street crime, that was smart.

36:39.324 --> 36:42.254
But I wonder what we're going to
find when we search your apartment.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.222
Go ahead. There's nothing to find.

36:44.252 --> 36:45.588
Nothing but ashes.

36:45.618 --> 36:49.546
Well, we know you burned
Dr. Westbrooke's papers.

36:49.576 --> 36:51.710
You have no proof for any of this, so....

36:51.744 --> 36:53.879
Unless you're going to
arrest me, I'm leaving.

36:53.947 --> 36:55.881
You know, Doc, I actually read your book.

36:55.915 --> 36:57.646
You wrote about irrational behaviour

36:57.676 --> 37:00.318
when dealing with a perceived
threat from a loved one.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.187
And how some people
would remove that threat

37:02.217 --> 37:03.894
by destroying that loved one,

37:03.924 --> 37:07.492
refusing to admit responsibility
even to themselves.

37:07.526 --> 37:11.196
Kinda sounds like what
you did to Dr. Westbrooke.

37:11.658 --> 37:16.093
Don't throw writings you
barely understand back at me.

37:16.586 --> 37:20.586
The authorities will be in touch
to effect the release of my patient.

37:21.591 --> 37:23.874
Thank you for coming in.

37:26.914 --> 37:28.713
She's right.

37:31.850 --> 37:36.153
All we have is the testimony
of a severely deranged man.

37:36.187 --> 37:40.390
We need evidence, hard
evidence to make this stick.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.710
Westbrooke was killed
over a research paper?

37:45.740 --> 37:50.234
The paper contradicted Kesler's book.
Her career and reputation were at risk.

37:50.301 --> 37:52.706
So that's motive. Now we need
hard evidence to support it.

37:52.736 --> 37:55.839
Kesler burned and Westbrooke's
computer and the report.

37:55.873 --> 37:58.008
There's gotta be the other
copies of the report, though.

37:58.042 --> 38:00.121
I even checked the printer
memory at Westbrooke's practice,

38:00.151 --> 38:03.851
there's no trace of it, so...
either it was printed elsewhere,

38:03.881 --> 38:05.980
or Kesler left no stone unturned.

38:06.010 --> 38:08.184
Keep looking. It's all we got.

38:08.252 --> 38:10.528
- Maybe not.
- What do you mean?

38:10.558 --> 38:13.607
Marcus has got us this far.
Maybe we're missing something.

38:13.637 --> 38:15.642
How much more do you think
you can push this guy?

38:15.672 --> 38:18.299
I'm not sure, but he does want to help.

38:18.329 --> 38:21.079
- It may be our only shot at Kesler.
- Yeah.

38:30.540 --> 38:34.335
I don't know how much
help I can be, I just...

38:34.365 --> 38:36.973
- I really didn't see that much.
- You might have seen something

38:37.003 --> 38:41.316
that's important to us.
I want you to think hard.

38:41.384 --> 38:45.375
What happened to Dr. Kesler
after she hurt Dr. Westbrooke?

38:52.121 --> 38:55.397
I saw her get in her car...

39:00.074 --> 39:02.502
... and drive away.

39:03.579 --> 39:06.323
- That's all I saw.
- That's very helpful.

39:07.324 --> 39:10.139
Okay, go now. I shoulda
known he couldn't do it.

39:10.169 --> 39:12.938
- Marcus?
- I did good. You did good.

39:12.968 --> 39:14.548
- You're Okay.
- Yeah.

39:16.390 --> 39:18.623
- Was he of any help?
- He did good.

39:18.838 --> 39:20.774
I think he's gonna be
able to help you guys.

39:20.804 --> 39:22.234
Oh, Okay...

39:22.763 --> 39:25.626
Thank you for your help. You did great.

39:31.533 --> 39:33.396
He saw Dr. Kesler leave in her car.

39:33.426 --> 39:35.439
Maybe she had blood on her
hands when she opened the door.

39:35.469 --> 39:36.893
We might be able to grab
something from there.

39:36.923 --> 39:39.233
Now we just need proof of motive.

39:39.263 --> 39:42.655
So, we know she had help
editing her book, right?

39:42.685 --> 39:44.424
You think she had Harvey Holden look at it?

39:44.454 --> 39:47.107
It's possible. I'll get
Dev to head over there now.

39:47.441 --> 39:49.289
I'll get a warrant to check her car.

39:49.319 --> 39:51.395
Get her back in here.

39:57.291 --> 40:00.426
You better have a damn good reason
for dragging my client back in here.

40:00.461 --> 40:03.829
Your client is under arrest for
the murder of Dr. Westbrooke.

40:03.864 --> 40:06.653
It's absurd. Based on the testimony

40:06.683 --> 40:09.682
of the constructed
persona of a troubled mind.

40:09.712 --> 40:12.181
He might as easily have said you
were at the scene of the crime.

40:12.211 --> 40:15.307
His testimony was helpful, but
it wasn't as damning as the traces

40:15.337 --> 40:18.051
of Dr. Westbrooke's blood we
found on your car door handle.

40:18.081 --> 40:22.256
For such detail-oriented person, I'd
have thought you'd have done a better job

40:22.286 --> 40:25.517
- cleaning up your mess, Doctor.
- Don't say a word.

40:26.194 --> 40:29.020
This doesn't make any sense.

40:29.211 --> 40:30.795
Why on earth would I hurt Rachel?

40:30.825 --> 40:34.490
Well, that is a good
question. Why would you?

40:39.853 --> 40:42.387
Dr. Westbrooke's review of your work.

40:42.417 --> 40:45.440
It invalidates every one of your theories.

40:45.854 --> 40:47.471
Where did you find that?

40:47.993 --> 40:52.135
It turns out Dr. Westbrooke trusted
one other person with her research.

40:52.165 --> 40:55.415
Are you familiar with a
patient of hers Harvey Holden?

40:57.347 --> 40:59.810
She trusted a patient to review her work?

40:59.840 --> 41:01.359
- Mallory...
- Not just a patient.

41:01.389 --> 41:06.348
Mr. Holden was a college professor
until his agoraphobia became heightened.

41:06.378 --> 41:09.327
We've got you for premeditated murder.

41:09.547 --> 41:13.497
Of course, you could always take
your chances with an insanity plea.

41:23.802 --> 41:25.914
You know, we make that
raspberry coulis right in house.

41:25.944 --> 41:28.678
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:29.168 --> 41:30.258
Can I get you anything else?

41:30.288 --> 41:33.373
Heavens no. But I have to say...

41:33.403 --> 41:35.989
... that was the most
incredible meal I've ever had.

41:36.019 --> 41:37.954
Really?

41:38.627 --> 41:40.957
Okay, that is...

41:41.024 --> 41:42.765
Wow, crazy, good.

41:42.795 --> 41:45.193
That's the sixth person
he's done this to today.

41:45.223 --> 41:47.921
- Could I get the bill?
- Oh no, no, no.

41:47.951 --> 41:51.167
You put your wallet back in your
pocket. Your money's no good here.

41:51.445 --> 41:55.104
My God, this night just
keeps getting better.

41:55.172 --> 41:57.106
I'm even inspired

41:57.136 --> 42:00.509
to write an epic poem about the experience.

42:00.577 --> 42:03.702
- You mean, after your review, right?
- Review? What do you mean?

42:03.732 --> 42:08.338
- You are David Fickler, right?
- Not according to my birth certificate.

42:09.393 --> 42:13.476
- Would you excuse me for a moment, please?
- Of course.

42:14.985 --> 42:17.924
Could you just help the
gentleman on his way out the door.

42:17.954 --> 42:20.262
- Yup.
- Thank you.

42:24.250 --> 42:28.259
Why didn't you tell me
that wasn't David Fickler?

42:28.289 --> 42:32.273
- You didn't ask.
- Hey, how did everything go?

42:32.307 --> 42:35.108
It didn't. Fickler didn't even show up.

42:35.138 --> 42:39.217
Oh, he was here. And by all
accounts, did a great job.

42:39.247 --> 42:41.820
Really? Like seriously?

42:42.078 --> 42:45.051
What do you mean? Like four star well?

42:45.119 --> 42:47.606
More like three and a half. I hear
the beef Wellington was a tad dry.

42:47.636 --> 42:50.585
I can live with that. I mean, that's our
special recipe, that's how we do it here,

42:50.615 --> 42:51.762
but that's fine.

42:52.106 --> 42:53.793
Oh my God, when this review comes out,

42:53.828 --> 42:55.568
the whole restaurant's gonna blow up.

42:55.598 --> 42:58.668
I gotta tell to Ahmed! We're gonna need
a second location. We can franchise.

42:58.669 --> 42:59.669
Tia.

43:00.872 --> 43:03.703
- Ahmet!
- You're not gonna tell him?

43:03.738 --> 43:06.339
What, that David Fickler
is just a pseudonym we use?

43:06.373 --> 43:09.475
Or that I'm the one
who took the assignment?

43:09.509 --> 43:12.812
- Was the beef actually dry?
- You'll have to read my review.

43:12.847 --> 43:17.619
You're good. Can we get a few shots. Two.
