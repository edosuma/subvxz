00:51.466 --> 00:56.472
So the TV just
shut off by itself

00:56.505 --> 01:03.579
so I thought I would
start recording.

01:03.612 --> 01:08.016
Hm, just heard like jiggling
handle or something.

01:11.719 --> 01:15.957
Hello?

01:15.990 --> 01:20.396
Is someone here?

01:20.429 --> 01:27.903
Did you shut the TV off?

01:27.936 --> 01:29.339
Hm, I don't know.

01:39.013 --> 01:40.682
Strange.

01:40.715 --> 01:45.620
I'll just turn it
back on I guess, hm.

01:53.128 --> 01:56.465
Very weird.

02:02.504 --> 02:05.808
I keep hearing noises
by the door.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.676
Are you behind the door?

02:14.049 --> 02:17.387
I hear you out there.

02:23.658 --> 02:27.096
I thought I saw it
move a little bit.

02:43.778 --> 02:45.781
Ugh.

02:48.050 --> 02:51.620
Oh my god.

02:51.652 --> 02:52.620
Hey, what's going on guys,
welcome back

02:52.653 --> 02:54.088
to Sparks of the Paranormal.

02:54.122 --> 02:58.761
Tonight's episode is The Conjuring.
That's right.

02:58.794 --> 03:00.529
Not the blockbuster movie
though guys.

03:00.562 --> 03:03.566
We're actually talking about
the house that inspired that.

03:03.598 --> 03:07.203
It's 300 years old, it's still
standing there in Rhode Island.

03:07.235 --> 03:09.537
The new owners,
Cory and Jen Heinzen

03:09.570 --> 03:11.507
have now opened the house

03:11.539 --> 03:13.709
to paranormal investigators.

03:26.153 --> 03:28.757
What in the world
would possess you

03:28.789 --> 03:32.060
to buy a house
with that kind of reputation?

03:32.093 --> 03:37.132
Reports of demonic activity,
reports of things flying.

03:37.164 --> 03:40.735
People all over the world
have come to know this house.

03:40.769 --> 03:43.239
I have heard many people
cannot handle staying here

03:43.271 --> 03:45.907
more than one night.

03:47.209 --> 03:49.979
Electronics
just do not last here.

03:50.012 --> 03:53.581
You can take video
of certain parts of the yard

03:53.615 --> 03:56.685
and the house
and like they'll glitch.

03:56.717 --> 03:59.054
We've had the house blessed
in the past.

03:59.086 --> 04:02.691
It interferes
with your daily life.

04:02.723 --> 04:07.195
- Did you pack for two weeks?
- Yes, sir.

04:07.229 --> 04:09.698
I can't believe we're
staying there that long.

04:09.730 --> 04:11.834
I still can't believe
we're doing this.

04:11.866 --> 04:14.736
You know, they told me
nobody's every stayed

04:14.770 --> 04:16.771
or wanted to stay this long.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.274
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

04:18.307 --> 04:21.576
Vera, this is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

04:21.610 --> 04:24.213
We're going to meet up with
our friends, Brian and Richel.

04:24.245 --> 04:27.248
It doesn't get any better
than this.

04:27.281 --> 04:31.686
We are on our way
to The Conjuring house.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.023
Oh-oh, say it one more time.

04:34.055 --> 04:39.627
We are on our way to
The Conjuring house.

04:39.661 --> 04:43.966
And we are actually
going to go investigate

04:43.999 --> 04:45.634
with Kendall and Vera.

04:55.276 --> 04:57.312
Time to get up.

05:04.853 --> 05:06.822
Vah, vah, voom!

05:11.026 --> 05:14.930
Don't mind me
I'm just getting some gas.

05:46.093 --> 05:50.231
Here we go.

06:09.184 --> 06:13.889
Hm.

06:13.922 --> 06:17.326
Ugh.

06:17.358 --> 06:19.093
Look at this place.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.403
How cool.

06:35.410 --> 06:36.845
Oh.

06:36.877 --> 06:39.213
- Hello?
- Hello.

06:39.247 --> 06:41.350
- How's it going?
- Can we come in? Thank you.

06:41.382 --> 06:42.850
- Come on in.
- How are you guys?

06:42.884 --> 06:44.286
- I'm Vera.
- Jen.

06:44.319 --> 06:46.722
Hi Jen, Cory, nice to meet you.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.456
I'm Kendall nice to meet you.

06:48.490 --> 06:51.259
- Hey, Kendall.
- Cory, nice to meet you.

06:51.293 --> 06:56.732
This is like the most famous
haunted house in the world.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.366
And we're here.

06:58.399 --> 07:00.301
This is crazy.

07:00.334 --> 07:02.971
We're crazy like
what are we thinking?

07:03.004 --> 07:04.406
You guys own it,
you guys just bought it.

07:04.439 --> 07:06.108
You're crazy? We're crazy.

07:06.141 --> 07:07.810
Everybody's gotta be
a little bit strange

07:07.843 --> 07:11.280
to do what we do, so.

07:14.348 --> 07:17.985
- My name's Cory Heinzen.
- I'm Jennifer Heinzen.

07:18.019 --> 07:20.756
And uh, we're the owners
of the home

07:20.788 --> 07:24.259
that inspired
the movie The Conjuring.

07:24.291 --> 07:27.495
Owned it for about
a year and a half now.

07:27.528 --> 07:30.766
What made you buy
this particular house?

07:30.798 --> 07:32.734
We were drawn to the house

07:32.767 --> 07:35.903
obviously because
of the movie The Conjuring.

07:35.937 --> 07:39.508
A few years ago, we actually
had walked by the place.

07:39.540 --> 07:44.079
Which we're not supposed to but,
I mean,

07:44.112 --> 07:45.114
it was just one of those things.

07:45.146 --> 07:47.115
You just want to see it.

07:47.149 --> 07:51.153
We had heard the house
was going up for sale.

07:51.185 --> 07:53.087
We were sitting down with
the owner before we knew it.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.258
We met with the owner before
we even met with a realtor.

07:57.291 --> 08:01.929
It got weird for me but
something about this place is...

08:01.963 --> 08:05.100
inviting.

08:05.132 --> 08:06.534
Everything you've
ever been told,

08:06.567 --> 08:08.336
you know, "Oh, that's not real,
that's not real."

08:08.370 --> 08:11.038
Oh yeah, it's real.

08:11.072 --> 08:13.208
Have you ever been scared?

08:15.543 --> 08:17.812
I've been scared before, yes.

08:17.846 --> 08:22.518
Me? Oh god, yeah.

08:29.591 --> 08:31.492
Uh-oh, guess who's here?

08:31.526 --> 08:34.263
Oh my goodness,
come on in, welcome.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.864
Well, hello.

08:37.999 --> 08:39.868
Even when you pull up and just
see it for the first time

08:39.900 --> 08:41.803
- it's like, we're there.
- When we pulled up he's like,

08:41.836 --> 08:43.404
"What do you think?"
I said, it looks like

08:43.437 --> 08:46.140
a cabin in the woods, like.

08:46.173 --> 08:49.211
I'm like, well, I'm excited.

08:49.244 --> 08:51.213
It just feels weird,
you... you know,

08:51.245 --> 08:53.481
you've been investigating
for such a long time.

08:53.514 --> 08:55.918
To actually be able to be
in a place like this.

08:55.951 --> 08:57.920
I've read about this
and I've seen things on this

08:57.952 --> 09:00.288
and now I'm sitting
in the parlor?

09:00.322 --> 09:01.990
Yeah, where all the stuff
went down?

09:02.023 --> 09:04.459
I'm... I don't know,
I want to get started.

09:04.491 --> 09:07.062
Vera, did you find out where
we're going to be sleeping?

09:07.095 --> 09:09.431
No, waiting for Jen and Cory.

09:09.464 --> 09:11.400
- Okay.
- Want to show them?

09:11.432 --> 09:14.001
Yeah.

09:14.034 --> 09:17.471
These floors are noisy.

09:17.504 --> 09:19.474
This is one of the rooms.

09:19.506 --> 09:22.109
We've got the birthing room
that's right off of it.

09:22.143 --> 09:25.247
- The what?
- Birthing room? Burning room?

09:25.279 --> 09:27.381
Like, as in giving birth?

09:27.414 --> 09:29.450
Yup.

09:29.484 --> 09:33.222
Oh my goodness.

09:33.254 --> 09:35.090
- Watch your head.
- Watch yourself,

09:35.123 --> 09:37.492
these things are right there
to get you in the head.

09:37.524 --> 09:39.894
Wow, look at that crack.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.065
Ha-ha, this is crazy.

09:44.099 --> 09:46.001
This is so awesome.

09:46.033 --> 09:48.569
Whoa! That's what
you're talking about?

09:48.602 --> 09:50.638
- Yeah.
- A little diagram.

09:50.672 --> 09:53.475
Apparently,
we've got some tricksters.

09:53.508 --> 09:57.913
- Drawing pentagrams in there?
- I'm fixing this.

09:57.946 --> 10:00.883
Someone drew a pentagram
on it and Cory and Jennifer

10:00.916 --> 10:04.019
would prefer
that it not be there so.

10:04.052 --> 10:06.021
I'm getting rid of it.

10:06.053 --> 10:07.355
Awesome.

10:13.193 --> 10:16.030
This is the most active room
in the house.

10:16.063 --> 10:19.500
This is the room that
Cindy Perron stayed in.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.003
There were two sisters
that stayed in this room.

10:21.035 --> 10:23.104
Cindy being one of them
and she was the one

10:23.138 --> 10:24.373
that got tormented the worst

10:24.405 --> 10:26.107
out of the five sisters.

10:26.140 --> 10:28.043
Everybody that's ever
stayed in this room,

10:28.076 --> 10:30.946
like they lose track of time.

10:30.979 --> 10:33.315
Flashes of light, shadows.

10:33.347 --> 10:36.284
- Side pain, which is random.
- Side pain, which is weird.

10:37.485 --> 10:39.053
Well, the good thing Vera,

10:39.086 --> 10:41.122
is that we're going
to be right there

10:41.155 --> 10:43.090
if you get uncomfortable.

10:43.124 --> 10:45.460
You can always get one of us up.

10:45.493 --> 10:48.230
We can document
what's happening.

10:48.263 --> 10:51.600
I got it.

10:51.633 --> 10:54.937
Extra batteries
for anything that we need.

10:57.538 --> 11:01.475
To me, it feels eerily uneasy

11:01.509 --> 11:06.648
because we don't know
what we're walking into.

11:06.681 --> 11:10.052
We only know what
we've heard and seen.

11:10.085 --> 11:11.519
You know what I mean?

11:11.552 --> 11:13.355
I've always wanted to do this.

11:13.388 --> 11:15.324
And how do you feel
that now you're here?

11:18.259 --> 11:20.629
I'm very nervous,
I'm not gonna lie.

11:20.662 --> 11:21.997
What about you, Kendall?

11:22.029 --> 11:24.231
Let me film you.

11:24.264 --> 11:27.168
For us, we want to just
document the hell out of it.

11:27.201 --> 11:30.237
Want to get every camera
that we could possibly have.

11:30.270 --> 11:32.274
I mean, they have cameras,
we have cameras,

11:32.307 --> 11:34.042
like let's just film everything.

11:34.075 --> 11:38.146
Nobody's doing this,
nobody's staying at a place

11:38.178 --> 11:39.648
for more than
one night or two nights.

11:39.681 --> 11:43.218
We're living with them.

11:44.249 --> 11:45.153
Let's go explore the house.

11:54.028 --> 11:55.230
Okay.

11:55.263 --> 11:58.300
This just fell out of this book.

11:58.332 --> 12:00.067
- Oh.
- What would be so amazing

12:00.100 --> 12:02.471
if I picked it up and it says,
Bathsheba.

12:02.504 --> 12:06.274
Stop it. No.

12:06.307 --> 12:07.408
Okay.

12:12.647 --> 12:14.449
"Dasein Being in the world..."

12:14.481 --> 12:16.617
Don't repeat it,
what if it's like...

12:16.650 --> 12:20.389
This is exactly like
Cabin in the Woods.

12:20.422 --> 12:23.258
Don't read it out loud.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.394
- I'm gonna say it.
- Oh my god, you guys.

12:25.427 --> 12:31.033
- What's it say?
- Dasein being in the world.

12:33.234 --> 12:36.138
- Okay, no more of that.
- No.

12:50.418 --> 12:52.421
This doll doesn't have any face

12:52.453 --> 12:55.189
and those always creep me out.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.266
What about this, Kendall?

13:05.299 --> 13:07.735
What do you got?

13:07.769 --> 13:09.471
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

13:09.504 --> 13:10.705
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

13:10.738 --> 13:13.208
No.

13:16.577 --> 13:19.747
Don't lock me out!

13:27.889 --> 13:30.358
This looks like
it's down to the basement.

13:56.618 --> 13:59.153
Hey!

13:59.187 --> 14:00.721
Come here.

14:00.754 --> 14:02.790
Come here, come here, come here.

14:02.823 --> 14:05.359
It just absolutely
sounded like somebody

14:05.393 --> 14:08.697
ran away from here.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.831
And it backed me up.

14:10.865 --> 14:13.301
Like I looked up
at Richel like this

14:13.333 --> 14:14.635
to make sure she wasn't moving.

14:14.668 --> 14:17.338
She wasn't,
she was talking to you guys

14:17.371 --> 14:21.342
and then I backed up
in this corner like this.

14:21.375 --> 14:22.910
Because it was absolutely
like somebody

14:22.943 --> 14:28.716
just ran from here.

14:28.750 --> 14:29.650
Kendall, you want to go?

14:29.683 --> 14:31.719
Yeah, let's do it.

14:31.753 --> 14:34.589
Oh, it smells funky.

14:34.621 --> 14:37.492
Y'all, it smells really
funky down here.

14:40.662 --> 14:43.498
Ugh! What touched me,
what touched me, what touch me?

14:43.530 --> 14:46.433
You're all right, you're all
right, you'll all right.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.302
Ah! You guys, are you serious?

14:48.336 --> 14:50.371
- Something touched me!
- Snake skin.

14:50.404 --> 14:52.307
Something touched me, it did.
No!

14:52.340 --> 14:57.345
Don't do that,
what is still in there?

14:57.378 --> 14:59.681
Dude, for real?

14:59.714 --> 15:01.917
Did Cory and Jen put
them there on purpose?

15:01.950 --> 15:03.552
I don't think
they put them there.

15:03.585 --> 15:05.387
Oh my god, did that touch me?

15:05.419 --> 15:07.254
Is that a mouth?

15:07.288 --> 15:08.722
Yes, that's it's mouth.

15:08.755 --> 15:12.526
Dude, you can see its eyeballs.

15:12.559 --> 15:15.529
What is this?

15:15.562 --> 15:18.199
It looks like
an old furnace kind of.

15:18.232 --> 15:20.834
- Don't pull that!
- Dude, come on.

15:20.868 --> 15:23.638
Sorry, I just couldn't resist.

15:28.576 --> 15:29.711
No way.

15:29.744 --> 15:32.214
This is the area where the kid

15:32.246 --> 15:33.981
would come down
and talk to somebody

15:34.014 --> 15:37.418
who apparently wasn't living.

15:37.451 --> 15:39.520
Oh wow.

15:39.553 --> 15:42.423
I think there's a claim
in this area

15:42.456 --> 15:45.326
that an investigative team
was in here

15:45.360 --> 15:48.230
and they saw what looked like
a person come out of this room.

15:48.263 --> 15:53.301
It had its neck snapped.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.736
Don't be talking about...

15:55.769 --> 15:57.471
claims yet.

15:57.504 --> 16:00.741
Oh dear.

16:00.774 --> 16:03.944
What is that?

16:03.977 --> 16:06.880
Oh, it's like a... it feels
like a refrigerator in there.

16:06.913 --> 16:08.582
Is this steps?

16:08.615 --> 16:09.918
- Those are steps.
- Oh.

16:09.951 --> 16:12.620
They go out to
the outside maybe?

16:12.653 --> 16:14.588
Oh my gosh.

16:14.621 --> 16:17.625
It's freezing.

16:27.501 --> 16:29.536
Hey guys,
let's get the cameras set up.

16:29.570 --> 16:32.007
Yeah.

16:39.447 --> 16:41.883
We'll check the angles
in a minute.

16:48.690 --> 16:51.059
We've got some 4K cameras
with sound.

16:51.091 --> 16:58.566
We can see and hear
what's happening in each room.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.742
- I know y'all.
- Welcome to the party, man.

17:09.777 --> 17:12.047
You guys, I'm Anthony,
nice to meet y'all.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.647
Thanks for uh,
thanks for having me.

17:14.682 --> 17:16.651
We thought this was
a really awesome setting

17:16.683 --> 17:20.689
for Cory and Jen to kind of give
us the rundown on the house.

17:20.721 --> 17:22.891
When did you guys move
into the house?

17:22.923 --> 17:27.595
Uh, we got the keys
on June 21 of 2019.

17:27.627 --> 17:32.933
I mean, we moved in
probably around one o'clock

17:32.967 --> 17:37.105
and we had doors
opening up like 1:15.

17:37.137 --> 17:39.073
We were moving in with gear

17:39.106 --> 17:40.674
before we were moving
in with clothes

17:40.708 --> 17:42.944
and stuff like that.

17:42.977 --> 17:45.413
I had a DVR system set up

17:45.445 --> 17:47.514
before anything else.

18:01.128 --> 18:02.563
It was profound
but at the same time

18:02.596 --> 18:04.398
where it's an old house.

18:04.432 --> 18:07.368
Were we just stepping on
like certain planks.

18:07.402 --> 18:09.804
The movie based on a true story

18:09.836 --> 18:11.105
so you're already
coming into the house

18:11.138 --> 18:13.540
and you're like, "Oh my god,

18:13.574 --> 18:15.810
who's going to get thrown first.

18:15.843 --> 18:18.046
Who's going to get bit?
Who's going to get that?"

18:18.078 --> 18:22.750
We just took it easy because
we didn't know what was here.

18:22.784 --> 18:25.487
What else happened?

18:25.519 --> 18:28.423
It was within the first week
that objects themselves

18:28.455 --> 18:30.824
were moving.

18:32.727 --> 18:34.129
Which was exciting, you know,

18:34.162 --> 18:35.997
it's kind of what we wanted.

18:36.029 --> 18:37.632
It was just more
or less waiting for that,

18:37.664 --> 18:41.068
"Okay,
what's going to be scary?"

18:41.102 --> 18:42.937
We have been warned
several times

18:42.970 --> 18:46.807
that something bad is still here

18:46.840 --> 18:50.444
and that it will
eventually show itself.

18:54.816 --> 18:59.921
I've had my hair touched
a couple times.

18:59.953 --> 19:02.890
I guess the most
profound one was...

19:02.923 --> 19:05.160
something felt like
it grabbed my hips

19:05.192 --> 19:06.627
and I thought it was Cory.

19:06.661 --> 19:07.961
So I turned around
to see what was going on

19:07.994 --> 19:10.197
and nobody was there.

19:10.230 --> 19:16.770
Then, we see a shadow figure.

19:16.804 --> 19:19.474
Do you have any advice
for us staying here tonight?

19:19.507 --> 19:23.111
I mean, this is our first night,
you know.

19:23.144 --> 19:25.113
A lot of us
haven't stayed overnight

19:25.145 --> 19:27.949
at a haunted location before,
so.

19:27.981 --> 19:29.884
You guys are like the pros here.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.453
I'm just saying,
just be careful what you ask for

19:32.487 --> 19:36.191
as far as activity because
they will get your attention

19:36.223 --> 19:37.558
by any way possible.

19:44.164 --> 19:46.134
Cut.

20:42.757 --> 20:46.161
Here we are.

21:22.028 --> 21:23.830
in this mic.

21:23.864 --> 21:28.201
We just heard a noise that
sounded like a door latch.

21:28.234 --> 21:31.238
Richel.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.662
Good morning.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.864
Morning.

22:29.896 --> 22:35.269
I slept good but I was like
almost like practically asleep

22:35.301 --> 22:38.105
and something bumped my bed.

22:38.138 --> 22:42.275
- Was it Brian?
- And Brian told me he heard it.

22:42.308 --> 22:46.213
So tonight, I think we rig
this room after we go to sleep.

22:46.247 --> 22:48.682
- Those little...
- Sensors?

22:48.715 --> 22:50.150
Yeah, put the sensors
on the stairs,

22:50.183 --> 22:52.019
put the music box in the room.

22:52.053 --> 22:54.789
Yeah, this means sensor.

23:02.128 --> 23:06.833
Cooking a little breakfast
at The Conjuring house.

23:09.269 --> 23:11.172
You know,
hey that's a good idea.

23:11.204 --> 23:15.442
Take pictures from the.

23:23.451 --> 23:26.254
We have cameras set up
around the house.

23:26.287 --> 23:29.323
Do we want to put something
that will light up

23:29.355 --> 23:32.393
or make noise in the vision
of all these places?

23:32.425 --> 23:34.194
I say yes.

23:34.228 --> 23:35.329
I second that.

23:35.362 --> 23:40.468
We have the music box.

23:40.500 --> 23:44.004
That thing is creepy
when you know you're the one

23:44.038 --> 23:46.074
- who set it off.
- Yeah.

23:46.106 --> 23:49.410
I want the music box up
in our room.

23:49.442 --> 23:51.479
How creepy will it be
if we're all sleeping

23:51.511 --> 23:53.748
and all of a sudden
this music goes off.

23:53.780 --> 23:56.416
We're going to have to lay
in our beds to make sure...

23:56.450 --> 23:59.821
cause it detects motion,
to make sure that none of us

23:59.854 --> 24:04.726
- set it off.
- Gotcha.

24:04.759 --> 24:06.827
Wave you hand in front of it
to make sure it works.

24:11.898 --> 24:14.968
Perfect.

24:15.001 --> 24:18.940
If it continues to play
that's the scary thing.

24:18.972 --> 24:20.774
That means it's standing there

24:20.807 --> 24:24.179
and then if it goes off it...

24:26.180 --> 24:28.483
- that thing's accurate.
- What I like about this

24:28.516 --> 24:31.952
is the range is not that large.

24:31.986 --> 24:34.489
- They have to be close to us.
- There you go.

24:34.521 --> 24:38.225
So if it goes off that
means it's closer to you.

24:48.301 --> 24:50.504
We have several devices.

24:50.538 --> 24:53.807
These are just ways for us
to be able to see,

24:53.840 --> 24:56.476
hear, communicate with you.

25:00.181 --> 25:02.150
Who's in this house?

25:09.589 --> 25:11.125
Feels heavy.

25:11.157 --> 25:13.193
It does.

25:17.364 --> 25:19.432
Pull that board back.

25:25.839 --> 25:31.178
I mean, look at that.

25:31.211 --> 25:33.114
They lowered a recorder

25:33.146 --> 25:35.383
with a plastic bag
into the water.

25:35.415 --> 25:39.220
They got a defined EVP

25:39.252 --> 25:41.855
some kind of
electronic voice phenomenon.

25:43.423 --> 25:44.858
I kind of do want
to get down there

25:44.892 --> 25:46.294
to be honest with you.

25:46.326 --> 25:47.862
- Let's do it.
- Let's give it a shot.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.596
Let's just do it.

25:49.630 --> 25:50.832
I gotcha.

25:50.865 --> 25:53.267
You... Kendall.

25:56.604 --> 26:00.074
Oh.

26:00.106 --> 26:03.009
You're gonna get stuck in there.

26:05.078 --> 26:07.114
Give me the recorder.

26:07.146 --> 26:09.549
They've got EVPs down here

26:09.583 --> 26:11.352
and in the water they
actually took the recorder

26:11.384 --> 26:13.186
which we have right here.

26:13.220 --> 26:15.990
We have the recorder right here

26:16.022 --> 26:21.261
and they've taken EVPs
out of this well.

26:21.295 --> 26:23.564
So I thought I'd take it
a step further

26:23.596 --> 26:26.968
and climb down in here
and just kind of feel out

26:27.000 --> 26:29.971
the environment down here.

26:35.643 --> 26:39.247
Are you inside this well?

26:46.921 --> 26:52.326
Man, it is creepy down here.

26:52.358 --> 26:55.562
Is there anybody
in here with me?

27:06.105 --> 27:08.409
Uh oh, my light's freaking out.

27:16.150 --> 27:20.054
No, no, no, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

27:20.086 --> 27:21.122
All right, I'm done.

27:21.154 --> 27:25.558
Coming up, guys.

27:25.592 --> 27:32.466
It's just like a creature
coming out of the ground here.

27:32.499 --> 27:36.202
- Well, well.
- He got up and said "Well."

28:18.144 --> 28:21.081
All right, so looks good.

28:21.115 --> 28:23.017
All set there.

28:23.049 --> 28:27.488
Let's lower this down
at the same time if we can.

29:00.554 --> 29:03.724
Guys remember the time too?

29:03.757 --> 29:05.793
That totally was the time.

29:05.826 --> 29:13.401
It seems as if I caught
a small orb-like light mist.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.242
You guys said that you heard

29:22.276 --> 29:24.178
footsteps in our room
like all night long.

29:24.211 --> 29:28.516
Oh yeah.

29:28.548 --> 29:31.152
Just a consistent...

30:01.748 --> 30:03.217
I think when
I step on the stairs

30:03.250 --> 30:06.420
it makes the other ones move.

30:06.452 --> 30:10.357
Everything's super creaky here.

30:54.233 --> 30:55.468
You know, my bed just moved.

30:55.501 --> 31:02.308
My bed moved too.

31:02.342 --> 31:04.478
Yeah, like vibrating.

31:42.682 --> 31:46.586
There's a space up there
that we've never been into.

31:46.619 --> 31:49.189
It's got four screws
that you can unscrew it

31:49.222 --> 31:50.924
and I'm sure you probably
could climb up into it.

31:50.958 --> 31:52.692
That has to be an attic.

31:52.726 --> 31:54.662
We've just never been
into it before.

31:54.694 --> 31:58.264
So we'll be the first ones
to be here

31:58.298 --> 31:59.666
when you open it up?

31:59.700 --> 32:02.769
Let's do it, yes.

32:02.803 --> 32:07.241
So it's right in here.

32:07.273 --> 32:11.711
Yeah, so I think
we just unscrew it.

32:11.744 --> 32:13.346
I mean, it could be nothing

32:13.380 --> 32:14.915
but I think it would have
to lead to something

32:14.948 --> 32:19.653
if it's... if it's blocked off.

32:19.685 --> 32:22.722
What's the worst
that could happen.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.670
Oh, there you go.

32:37.703 --> 32:39.405
- Got all of them?
- Yeah.

32:39.439 --> 32:40.641
All right, I'm gonna move it
and then I'm going to

32:40.673 --> 32:41.741
get out of the way, okay?

32:41.775 --> 32:44.845
- All right.
- One, two.

32:46.646 --> 32:47.780
Yeah.

32:54.855 --> 32:56.522
You're just putting your hand up
there and looking around.

32:56.556 --> 32:58.459
Like fucking hell I am.

32:58.491 --> 33:01.894
I ain't getting up there.

33:01.928 --> 33:04.898
All right.

33:04.931 --> 33:06.500
Here we go.

33:30.390 --> 33:33.861
You said you wanted to go up
there, what do you think?

33:33.894 --> 33:37.931
- I'm willing.
- Yeah?

33:37.963 --> 33:40.567
Don't want your shoes
to get dirty.

33:40.599 --> 33:44.804
All right.

33:44.837 --> 33:46.673
Do you want to get
on my shoulders?

33:46.707 --> 33:48.742
You got it?

33:50.711 --> 33:52.746
- Can I see the flashlight?
- Yup.

33:52.778 --> 33:54.315
- Hey Jen?
- Yeah?

33:54.347 --> 33:58.384
Here's the GoPro.

33:58.417 --> 34:01.754
Do you think we could
get back there.

34:01.788 --> 34:04.325
Um.

34:04.357 --> 34:05.893
Let me see
what the floors look like.

34:05.925 --> 34:08.494
We definitely could size wise.

34:08.527 --> 34:12.398
Okay.

34:12.431 --> 34:14.467
And it does go
all the way both ways.

34:14.501 --> 34:16.503
It's almost like it separates

34:16.536 --> 34:21.541
in between each bedroom.

34:21.574 --> 34:23.109
Be careful.

34:27.981 --> 34:30.650
I don't know, do you think
I should crawl in there?

34:36.489 --> 34:40.893
All right, let's see
if I can get in there.

34:40.927 --> 34:43.797
Look at that, how cool is that?

34:43.829 --> 34:46.431
So cool.

34:46.465 --> 34:50.371
Look, an old nail.

34:50.402 --> 34:51.771
That's cool.

34:51.804 --> 34:53.507
Oh, wow.

34:53.539 --> 34:55.641
That's hand-forged.

34:59.579 --> 35:03.417
I see a little tiny dead mouse.

35:07.820 --> 35:10.990
I tried to look down in there,
I don't see...

35:16.929 --> 35:22.969
- All right, I'll come down.
- Okay.

35:23.003 --> 35:24.571
Do you want to put
something up here?

35:24.603 --> 35:26.806
What do you think about
that motion detector?

35:26.840 --> 35:28.575
It will make a noise.

35:28.608 --> 35:33.814
If you guys are okay
with us leaving it uncovered.

35:33.847 --> 35:36.784
Yeah, it'd be interesting
to see what happens.

35:36.817 --> 35:38.652
- Yeah.
- Leave it uncovered

35:38.684 --> 35:41.521
for a couple of nights and put
some cameras up there and...

35:41.554 --> 35:43.757
Yeah.

35:43.789 --> 35:47.860
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Oh, yeah.

35:47.893 --> 35:50.430
What is that exactly?
What is that device right there?

35:50.463 --> 35:55.735
It's a motion detector
that is touch sensitive.

35:55.768 --> 35:58.738
If there's something
that comes near it

35:58.771 --> 36:00.173
with the sensors down here

36:00.206 --> 36:03.710
and hits this antenna
something will go off.

36:03.742 --> 36:05.746
Someone has to be
pretty close to it

36:05.778 --> 36:07.914
but it's worth a shot I mean,
nobody's been up here.

36:16.590 --> 36:19.159
Since we opened this
and it's not been opened before

36:19.192 --> 36:23.831
maybe somebody will
want to get close to it.

36:23.864 --> 36:25.231
So we're going to leave
this open

36:25.264 --> 36:27.533
and see what it does
for the night.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.670
We've got the RemPod
up there we should...

36:29.702 --> 36:31.938
we'll get a camera on that.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.874
Yeah, angles like that
would be perfect.

36:33.907 --> 36:35.709
Okay.

36:59.865 --> 37:00.967
All right, there we go.

37:01.001 --> 37:01.969
Cool.

37:31.797 --> 37:34.267
I always like to scare myself
before I go to bed

37:34.300 --> 37:38.838
so let's go down
to the basement.

38:44.737 --> 38:47.840
So I want to hear
something or something.

39:39.858 --> 39:42.695
Oh!

39:45.197 --> 39:48.402
Oh my god,
the freaking heater kicked on.

39:51.336 --> 39:53.974
Well, I always tell myself
I want to get scared

39:54.007 --> 39:55.208
before I go to bed here

39:55.240 --> 40:00.380
so I think I just scared myself.

40:00.413 --> 40:03.784
I went for like just
a little walk downstairs

40:03.817 --> 40:06.420
and uh, it's quiet down there.

40:06.452 --> 40:08.288
- Super, super quiet.
- Down where?

40:08.320 --> 40:10.089
- Downstairs.
- In the basement?

40:10.123 --> 40:11.324
- In the basement, yeah.
- You went to the basement?

40:11.356 --> 40:13.460
Yeah I went to the basement.

40:13.492 --> 40:15.429
I was like,
I want to scare myself so.

40:24.336 --> 40:27.807
Is that coming downstairs
or coming upstairs?

40:30.744 --> 40:32.846
- Hello?
- I'm gonna look, hang on.

40:32.878 --> 40:34.081
Hello?

40:34.114 --> 40:36.817
That sounded like
coming upstairs.

40:36.849 --> 40:37.784
Shh!

40:47.260 --> 40:49.229
I literally heard
footsteps coming upstairs.

40:49.262 --> 40:50.163
Hang on.

40:53.900 --> 40:54.968
Let's see.

41:07.179 --> 41:10.817
They're all in their bed.

41:10.849 --> 41:14.121
And that is weird.

41:14.153 --> 41:17.257
Yeah. Anthony's in his bed,
they're all in their beds.

41:36.476 --> 41:41.148
I can't talk,
I'm so tired.

41:41.181 --> 41:45.318
I kinda dreamed
about a woman

41:45.351 --> 41:49.789
hitting the door,
the back door, of the...

41:49.822 --> 41:52.259
somewhere, like,
hitting a door, like,

41:52.291 --> 41:55.161
but I think
it was like the back door

41:55.195 --> 42:00.066
that leads to the backyard
from the dining room,

42:00.099 --> 42:04.971
and she was saying,
"No more séance!"

42:05.003 --> 42:06.539
- What?
- Yeah.

42:06.572 --> 42:08.107
"No more séance"?

42:08.141 --> 42:11.577
Yeah, I was half asleep
half awake, uh...

42:11.610 --> 42:13.480
I heard it.

42:13.512 --> 42:15.181
I'm thinking
I heard it in my dream,

42:15.215 --> 42:17.417
but I'm thinking
it's a dream.

42:17.449 --> 42:18.551
But I heard it.

42:18.585 --> 42:20.452
Wow.

42:20.485 --> 42:22.254
I heard it,
it was loud,

42:22.288 --> 42:25.125
and then hitting the door,
like, throwing rocks,

42:25.157 --> 42:27.993
almost like throwing
something at the door.

42:28.027 --> 42:29.163
I don't know.

42:32.364 --> 42:35.501
'Cause that light's not on,
makes a difference.

42:35.534 --> 42:36.936
Did it go in or not?

42:36.969 --> 42:38.437
I think it went behind it.

42:55.655 --> 42:58.490
I was chatting
with my neighbor yesterday,

42:58.523 --> 43:01.161
and after we got done chatting,

43:01.193 --> 43:04.630
his phone just decided
to die on him,

43:04.664 --> 43:06.132
and at the same time,

43:06.164 --> 43:08.235
his wife was
sitting at the computer

43:08.268 --> 43:12.105
and she ended up
getting a scratch

43:12.137 --> 43:13.973
on her neck.

43:14.007 --> 43:17.043
Now, they've reported, like,
crazier stuff than we have,

43:17.076 --> 43:20.213
it's just ours is
more documented, I guess.

43:20.246 --> 43:23.083
They've just learned
to kinda deal with it.

43:23.115 --> 43:25.184
- That's your neighbor?
- Yep.

43:25.217 --> 43:26.619
Holy mackerel.

43:26.652 --> 43:29.889
I think it's where we're at,

43:29.922 --> 43:31.625
the property itself,
the land.

43:31.657 --> 43:36.496
Yeah, the land, like,
everything here was...

43:36.528 --> 43:40.032
just saturated with blood
during the King Philip's War,

43:40.065 --> 43:41.600
so...

43:41.634 --> 43:44.036
- What war?
- King Philip's War.

43:44.070 --> 43:45.472
Really?

43:58.684 --> 44:01.621
I wanna walk the land.

44:01.653 --> 44:03.322
Go out and explore.

44:03.356 --> 44:08.361
John actually had a spirit box
lead him to a cemetery

44:08.393 --> 44:09.628
that we didn't know about.

44:09.661 --> 44:11.230
Really?

44:11.264 --> 44:14.067
And the spirit box told him...
led him where to go.

44:14.099 --> 44:16.235
Left, right,
keep going straight.

44:19.605 --> 44:24.677
Cory, Kendall, and others
have told me that

44:24.710 --> 44:28.180
behind the house
is an old foundation

44:28.213 --> 44:30.416
where the kids used to play.

44:30.449 --> 44:34.687
And they said after they had
returned from the foundation,

44:34.721 --> 44:36.489
activity had picked up.

44:36.521 --> 44:39.192
So yeah, we're going behind
the Conjure house.

44:43.695 --> 44:47.132
I actually got...
I brought a spare box, too,

44:47.166 --> 44:49.068
just in case.

44:49.101 --> 44:53.306
Spirits, I'm trying to find
an old foundation out here.

44:53.338 --> 44:55.208
Do you know where it is?

44:57.409 --> 45:00.346
Should I go straight,
left, or right?

45:00.380 --> 45:02.315
Straight.

45:02.347 --> 45:06.753
Did you guys hear it?
Straight.

45:06.786 --> 45:09.556
All right, spirits,
which way do I go?

45:09.588 --> 45:15.094
Straight?
Straight, left, or right?

45:15.128 --> 45:16.363
Left.

45:16.396 --> 45:18.631
Left, holy cow,
that was clear.

45:18.664 --> 45:20.300
Oh my God!

45:20.333 --> 45:23.403
That was a clear left, guys,
did you hear that?

45:23.436 --> 45:25.538
Oh my God!

45:29.108 --> 45:32.178
Left or right?

45:32.210 --> 45:35.147
- Right.
- Right.

45:35.181 --> 45:39.652
Okay.
There's the right.

45:39.684 --> 45:42.188
This is crazy, dude,
they're answering me every time.

45:42.221 --> 45:43.789
Do I go right or left?

45:46.391 --> 45:47.426
Right...

45:47.460 --> 45:49.596
Right.

45:51.664 --> 45:54.467
How clear is that, guys?
Every time.

46:00.306 --> 46:02.641
Oh, what is this up here?

46:02.675 --> 46:05.445
This kinda looks
like a foundation.

46:07.480 --> 46:09.349
Pretty sure it is, guys.

46:15.253 --> 46:17.089
I'm getting goosebumps out here.

46:21.226 --> 46:24.196
It's a perfect little square,
dude, this is it.

46:24.230 --> 46:26.833
This is it guys,
there's graves out here.

46:26.865 --> 46:28.333
Holy (bleep).

46:30.503 --> 46:33.840
I found it.

46:33.873 --> 46:37.543
Dude, I found it.

46:37.577 --> 46:39.279
Oh my God.

46:43.181 --> 46:45.651
Oh my God!

46:45.684 --> 46:47.119
Wow.

46:50.690 --> 46:51.858
This is crazy.

46:51.891 --> 46:54.394
So if this is
just a cemetery,

46:54.427 --> 46:56.262
the foundation
has to be nearby.

46:58.864 --> 47:00.567
That one's just
laying up against a tree.

47:04.769 --> 47:06.306
Switch this around.

47:24.923 --> 47:28.161
Thank you for guiding me,
this is crazy.

47:29.461 --> 47:31.898
Can you say goodbye?

47:31.931 --> 47:33.298
"Bye."

47:42.507 --> 47:44.143
- What?
- I swear to God.

47:48.713 --> 47:50.250
I just walked by it,

47:50.282 --> 47:52.384
I was gonna shut
the light off here, and...

47:52.418 --> 47:54.753
Yeah, that's crazy.

47:54.786 --> 47:56.688
What's it say?

47:56.722 --> 47:59.359
66.66.

47:59.391 --> 48:03.228
What did my, uh...

48:03.262 --> 48:05.597
His EMF detector
said the same thing.

48:15.641 --> 48:17.677
That's putting too much light
on my face.

48:21.713 --> 48:22.748
That's what you were doing.

48:22.782 --> 48:25.785
Mm-hm.

48:26.885 --> 48:28.288
Okay, you're normal here.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.589
The one wasn't normal, man.

48:30.623 --> 48:31.758
Oh, I'm getting chills!

48:31.791 --> 48:33.459
When I first looked at it,
I thought...

48:33.492 --> 48:34.794
Lemme see.

48:34.827 --> 48:36.563
Lemme see the new one.

48:36.596 --> 48:38.331
The new ones are... oh!

48:38.364 --> 48:40.532
It picked right back up!

48:40.565 --> 48:41.733
I can't deal.

48:41.766 --> 48:43.669
The new ones are like this.

48:43.702 --> 48:45.838
Just... oh, that's me.

48:45.871 --> 48:47.407
They're normal.

48:47.440 --> 48:48.942
- See how they're normal?
- Yeah.

48:48.974 --> 48:50.476
Zoom in on it.

48:50.509 --> 48:51.711
Zoom in, normal.

48:51.744 --> 48:55.315
Yeah!

48:55.347 --> 48:56.983
But this one.

48:57.016 --> 48:59.418
I noticed it
in the smallest form,

48:59.452 --> 49:01.654
like, without
zooming it in.

49:01.686 --> 49:02.788
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

49:02.822 --> 49:04.657
I looked at it, I...

49:04.690 --> 49:06.326
And you noticed right away
that something was off.

49:06.358 --> 49:07.659
I knew something was wrong,

49:07.693 --> 49:09.295
then when I zoomed in on it...

49:16.302 --> 49:19.439
Okay, well, try to take it
and I'll try to move...

49:19.472 --> 49:20.840
Maybe I moved.

49:20.873 --> 49:22.575
Okay. Don't move.

49:22.608 --> 49:23.910
I mean, move.

49:28.047 --> 49:30.483
No.

49:33.853 --> 49:35.722
No.

49:35.755 --> 49:39.791
It's literally,
out of 20 pictures, the one.

49:46.032 --> 49:47.867
Probably the creepiest
I've ever seen you

49:47.900 --> 49:49.434
as a human being.

49:49.467 --> 49:52.471
That is so creepy.

49:52.505 --> 49:54.740
It sounded like somebody
was walking out here.

49:54.773 --> 49:56.708
I come through the kitchen,

49:56.742 --> 49:59.778
and Cory grabs me,
he says, "Come out here,

49:59.811 --> 50:00.813
come out here,"

50:00.847 --> 50:02.315
he's like, "I'm hearing
footsteps out here."

50:09.755 --> 50:11.291
That was a different noise.

50:19.699 --> 50:21.501
- Let's go look.
- I'm going back inside.

50:21.534 --> 50:24.070
Here's the GoPro.

50:24.103 --> 50:28.708
So we're circling left,
gonna follow her.

50:28.740 --> 50:30.076
It is a circle.

50:35.047 --> 50:36.715
Hold on, I've just
gotta shake it off.

50:36.748 --> 50:38.016
Yeah.

50:41.753 --> 50:43.690
Shit!

50:43.722 --> 50:45.358
- I told you!
- Why is that doing that?

50:45.391 --> 50:46.826
I don't know.

50:46.858 --> 50:48.327
It's freaking me out.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.795
- Are you hitting something?
- No!

50:49.829 --> 50:51.464
Shit, I'm like
super jumpy right now.

50:51.496 --> 50:52.597
Yeah, okay.

50:52.630 --> 50:54.867
But I didn't touch anything.

50:57.936 --> 50:59.371
Walkie check.

50:59.405 --> 51:00.873
Killed the walkie.

51:00.905 --> 51:02.641
And it's all...
look at where the dot is,

51:02.675 --> 51:03.843
it's way out here.

51:03.876 --> 51:06.512
It's not like
I just turned it on.

51:06.545 --> 51:07.680
That's crazy.

51:07.713 --> 51:10.483
- So that happened again.
- Yeah!

51:10.516 --> 51:11.517
Huh.

51:11.550 --> 51:13.119
Think something's, like...

51:13.152 --> 51:14.653
Messing with you?

51:14.686 --> 51:16.889
No! Why would you say that?

51:16.922 --> 51:19.858
I think that picture,
Richel's picture,

51:19.891 --> 51:22.594
put me over the edge.

51:22.628 --> 51:25.030
Well, let's just make a note
that there's no breeze

51:25.063 --> 51:27.399
coming through here.

51:27.432 --> 51:29.668
Right now, all the flames are
where they're supposed to be.

51:29.702 --> 51:32.004
Just in case
somebody starts feeling like

51:32.036 --> 51:35.507
a cold draft like we did
earlier?

51:35.541 --> 51:38.411
Everything seems to be
pretty normal with the candles.

51:43.715 --> 51:46.051
We've heard you upstairs,
we've heard you downstairs,

51:46.085 --> 51:48.688
we've heard you in the rooms
that we've been in.

51:48.721 --> 51:51.458
That's exactly
what we came here for.

51:56.762 --> 51:57.897
We know you're here.

51:57.929 --> 52:00.532
You can come out
and hang out with us.

52:04.170 --> 52:06.905
Just let your presence be known.

52:15.014 --> 52:18.851
What is that man right there,
can you tell 'em?

52:18.884 --> 52:21.586
The girl with the camera?

52:32.831 --> 52:33.932
Okay, I'm out.

52:33.965 --> 52:35.467
- What did it say?
- Bye!

52:35.501 --> 52:36.169
- It just said it.
- No, stop it.

52:36.202 --> 52:37.770
It said it!

52:55.153 --> 52:56.588
If you're in the kitchen...

52:56.621 --> 52:57.923
What the...

53:03.496 --> 53:06.465
- Oh...
- Dude!

53:06.498 --> 53:10.936
We've got cameras rolling
up there.

53:10.969 --> 53:12.137
Is it outside?

53:27.753 --> 53:29.222
Who's here with us?

53:38.963 --> 53:40.932
What are these
in front of us?

53:52.077 --> 53:54.146
Mm.

53:54.179 --> 53:58.284
Can you say that
one more time, please?

53:58.317 --> 54:00.052
What is this
in front of us?

54:10.929 --> 54:12.164
If you don't wanna say it,

54:12.197 --> 54:14.032
can you blow one of 'em out
if you don't wanna say it?

54:36.922 --> 54:39.925
Oh!

54:39.958 --> 54:41.326
Something came up to that door.

54:44.730 --> 54:47.132
The door did something.

54:47.166 --> 54:50.102
The door did something...

54:50.135 --> 54:51.971
I saw the door do something.

54:54.172 --> 54:55.307
It's out there.

54:55.340 --> 54:56.842
It's open.

54:59.277 --> 55:01.279
Fuck!

55:01.313 --> 55:03.816
Is it windy
inside the room, maybe?

55:03.849 --> 55:05.718
Not enough to open that door.

55:28.139 --> 55:29.842
What do you see?

55:29.875 --> 55:33.346
The door was closed
and it went open.

55:33.378 --> 55:35.213
But how did it...
like she was saying,

55:35.246 --> 55:36.915
how did it come
from over here?

55:36.949 --> 55:40.052
I musta seen the door open

55:40.085 --> 55:41.353
is what I musta seen.

55:41.387 --> 55:42.955
Why would it open?

55:42.987 --> 55:44.623
There was two sounds, though.

55:44.657 --> 55:47.727
So did somebody...
somebody bang on this door,

55:47.760 --> 55:50.229
run around
and fling that door open?

55:50.262 --> 55:51.397
Quick.

56:04.076 --> 56:07.679
It was the door opening,
'cause it was closed.

56:07.713 --> 56:09.181
I can see in here
that's it's closed

56:09.213 --> 56:11.182
'cause I can see
the whiteness, and then...

56:11.215 --> 56:12.817
The timing was
just impeccable,

56:12.851 --> 56:15.221
because I was challenging them
to do something.

56:15.253 --> 56:16.422
- Yeah.
- I was like,

56:16.454 --> 56:20.125
"Me and Brian don't believe
you can make one of those

56:20.159 --> 56:21.394
candles go out."

56:21.427 --> 56:23.896
It's funny, because
we all looked that way.

56:23.929 --> 56:26.032
Yeah, 'cause of the bang
there first, and then...

56:53.125 --> 56:54.360
Guys, we're gonna
head to the woods,

56:54.393 --> 56:55.927
if you wanna take the barn.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.862
Yeah. Go ahead.

56:57.896 --> 56:58.998
All right.

57:03.869 --> 57:06.372
- How far you wanna go?
- Right here.

57:06.405 --> 57:09.208
It'll be good.

57:09.240 --> 57:10.710
Look at that one window.

57:10.742 --> 57:12.077
Dude, that looks...

57:12.110 --> 57:14.480
It looks like somebody in it.

57:14.512 --> 57:19.050
The EMCCD camera is
an electron multiplying camera,

57:19.083 --> 57:23.088
so it basically
can sense photon events.

57:23.121 --> 57:24.757
This camera's
government issue,

57:24.789 --> 57:28.126
it's something scientists use
for everything from, like,

57:28.159 --> 57:33.264
counterfeit currency detection
to viruses under a microscope.

57:33.297 --> 57:37.502
This has been adapted
for paranormal investigations.

57:37.536 --> 57:40.039
There's a claim
that some light anomalies

57:40.072 --> 57:43.309
fly out from the house
and hit the tree line

57:43.342 --> 57:45.010
and illuminated the tree line.

57:45.043 --> 57:47.813
So if it happens,
we can capture it.

57:50.081 --> 57:51.983
We're rolling.

57:54.952 --> 57:56.322
Do you feel like
you're being watched?

57:56.355 --> 57:57.389
I do, man.

57:57.422 --> 57:59.324
Like, I feel like
there's a ton of eyeballs on us

57:59.358 --> 58:01.126
- from the tree line.
- I do too.

58:14.505 --> 58:16.074
Oh my goodness,
look at this,

58:16.108 --> 58:18.210
this is creepy.

58:18.242 --> 58:19.911
What are you feeling,
Richel?

58:19.945 --> 58:21.547
I've been tense
since we walked in here.

58:28.152 --> 58:29.554
What's up?

58:29.588 --> 58:31.423
That came from that way.

58:31.456 --> 58:35.161
- What'd you hear?
- It was a tree knock.

58:35.193 --> 58:37.963
It was a freakin' tree knock.

58:43.135 --> 58:46.472
Oh God.

58:46.505 --> 58:48.106
Oh.

58:48.139 --> 58:50.074
Anything there?

58:50.108 --> 58:52.044
Is there anybody here?

58:55.047 --> 58:57.516
Can you do the same thing
that you did this time?

59:03.021 --> 59:06.992
I just thought I saw something
straight up there.

59:07.025 --> 59:10.496
Is that you up there?

59:10.528 --> 59:12.965
I have this little device
over here that,

59:12.998 --> 59:15.067
I'm gonna put it
far away from us,

59:15.099 --> 59:16.935
that if you touch it,

59:16.969 --> 59:19.003
it will turn into
some pretty colors,

59:19.036 --> 59:23.107
and it will tell us as well
that you're here.

59:23.141 --> 59:24.876
So I'm gonna step back.

59:34.518 --> 59:36.187
Whoa!

59:36.221 --> 59:38.523
It's like glitching.

59:38.556 --> 59:42.060
What is happening with this?
Lookit.

59:42.094 --> 59:43.262
Come on.

59:55.673 --> 59:57.610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:57.643 --> 59:59.077
What's the matter?

59:59.110 --> 01:00:01.379
Look straight out.

01:00:01.413 --> 01:00:03.315
It's like something
at the tree line.

01:00:03.347 --> 01:00:05.217
And we keep hearing noises
that way.

01:00:08.954 --> 01:00:12.992
Yo, I got three minutes
left on my batt... on my card,

01:00:13.025 --> 01:00:15.126
I'm gonna go run in real quick,
'cause I wanna...

01:00:15.159 --> 01:00:16.194
I think I wanna go
to the trees.

01:00:16.228 --> 01:00:17.896
What do you guys think?

01:00:17.929 --> 01:00:19.264
- Let's go.
- I'll be right back.

01:00:25.202 --> 01:00:28.072
I thought I seen something
over here, like,

01:00:28.106 --> 01:00:29.341
a shadow or something.

01:00:55.634 --> 01:00:56.969
All right.

01:01:03.141 --> 01:01:04.476
The thing stopped.

01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:05.411
What stopped?

01:01:12.684 --> 01:01:15.454
- We're recording.
- Okay, that's cool, so...

01:01:15.487 --> 01:01:19.191
Look, there's a light
right there.

01:01:19.224 --> 01:01:20.326
Oh! There was a light
right there

01:01:20.358 --> 01:01:21.960
- that just faded out.
- That was weird.

01:01:21.994 --> 01:01:23.629
If you're there,
can you shine your light again?

01:01:26.697 --> 01:01:29.000
Hello?

01:01:29.034 --> 01:01:30.970
Whoa! Dude, you see that
out there?

01:01:31.003 --> 01:01:33.672
Yeah, totally.

01:01:33.704 --> 01:01:36.607
We gotta get this recorded.

01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:40.578
Dude, there's flashes
of light out there.

01:01:54.326 --> 01:01:57.530
Ooh! There's another one
that shined.

01:02:04.635 --> 01:02:06.704
Must... must be full?

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:18.851
I been...

01:02:18.884 --> 01:02:20.753
- What's up?
- The GoPro stopped,

01:02:20.786 --> 01:02:22.554
but we keep seeing lights
in the woods.

01:02:22.586 --> 01:02:24.289
You keep seeing lights
in the woods?

01:02:24.322 --> 01:02:25.224
They pop up, dude,
outta nowhere.

01:02:25.257 --> 01:02:26.358
Are you serious?
Really?

01:02:26.391 --> 01:02:27.693
They're like balls of light.

01:02:27.726 --> 01:02:31.329
There was one up even
in the trees out... up here.

01:02:31.362 --> 01:02:33.065
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. You'll see it happen.

01:02:33.097 --> 01:02:34.199
You could see one
up high, dude.

01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:35.634
Really? It moved?

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:01.125
Have you seen these woods, man?

01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:02.561
- They're badass.
- Yeah.

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:08.567
What was that?

01:03:12.536 --> 01:03:15.540
It sounded like a "whick."

01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:20.211
We are literally hearing
knocks from this way.

01:03:20.244 --> 01:03:21.579
Knocks. There's nobody out here.

01:03:21.612 --> 01:03:22.815
We just came out here...

01:03:22.847 --> 01:03:24.182
we were gonna go
to the barn,

01:03:24.215 --> 01:03:25.650
and we decided
to come here.

01:03:33.724 --> 01:03:36.295
What are you doing?

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:37.862
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

01:03:37.896 --> 01:03:39.664
Don't come,
I'm gonna go first.

01:03:39.697 --> 01:03:41.165
You're gonna go across it?

01:03:41.199 --> 01:03:43.367
Heck yeah, the noises are
coming from that way.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.769
Oh, it is the same.

01:03:44.802 --> 01:03:46.771
Hold on, what's the water
look like?

01:03:46.804 --> 01:03:48.639
It's nasty.

01:03:53.177 --> 01:03:54.846
Dude, this bridge is sketch.

01:03:58.550 --> 01:03:59.718
Don't go over.

01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:01.586
Here! Can I see the GoPro?

01:04:05.891 --> 01:04:06.724
That water's running, man.

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:08.594
You fall in that,
you're gonna...

01:04:08.626 --> 01:04:09.728
Come on back.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.496
- Stay there.
- Get back!

01:04:27.612 --> 01:04:30.282
The hell am I doing right now?

01:04:30.315 --> 01:04:33.217
To be honest with you...

01:04:33.251 --> 01:04:34.553
crazy.

01:04:46.898 --> 01:04:50.501
Guys, I'm halfway there.

01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:52.771
Whoa.

01:04:59.978 --> 01:05:01.280
All right, I made it.

01:05:05.617 --> 01:05:10.222
I literally have
chills right now.

01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:14.860
I'm super nervous, actually.

01:05:23.867 --> 01:05:26.304
Oh!

01:05:26.338 --> 01:05:29.341
What the heck?

01:05:29.373 --> 01:05:31.742
Oh!

01:05:31.775 --> 01:05:33.911
What is that?

01:05:37.949 --> 01:05:42.788
My GoPro's acting up,
my GoPro's like...

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.989
That was weird!

01:05:45.023 --> 01:05:46.425
That was super weird.

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:48.460
Was that you?

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.635
What the...

01:05:59.403 --> 01:06:01.373
Oh, dude, that's loud.

01:06:08.612 --> 01:06:10.681
Who's there?

01:06:10.715 --> 01:06:12.651
- Did you hear it too?
- Yes.

01:06:12.684 --> 01:06:13.752
I'm coming back.

01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:18.724
Was it a knock?

01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:22.394
Yeah. I'm telling you,
I heard the knock.

01:06:22.427 --> 01:06:26.898
It sounded like this... here,
let's freakin' knock back.

01:06:26.931 --> 01:06:28.432
This is... ready, ready?

01:06:28.465 --> 01:06:29.400
- Yeah.
- Hang on.

01:06:29.434 --> 01:06:30.469
Here we go.

01:06:30.501 --> 01:06:33.271
Was that you?

01:06:37.675 --> 01:06:39.277
Ooh!

01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:40.211
There was a knock that way.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.314
- Did you hear that?
- I heard the knock.

01:06:42.347 --> 01:06:43.815
Do it again, do it again.

01:06:43.847 --> 01:06:45.717
Was that you?
We heard you.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:47.719
Can you do it again?

01:06:47.751 --> 01:06:49.420
Can you do this?

01:06:53.023 --> 01:06:56.295
Holy (bleep).

01:06:56.327 --> 01:06:57.996
Holy (bleep)!

01:06:58.028 --> 01:06:58.896
Dude.

01:06:58.929 --> 01:07:00.431
Holy...

01:07:00.465 --> 01:07:02.300
Do it again, do it again,
do it again.

01:07:12.543 --> 01:07:14.078
It did it again,
it did it again.

01:07:14.112 --> 01:07:15.579
It was right here.

01:07:15.612 --> 01:07:16.781
I'm gonna give that to... here.

01:07:16.815 --> 01:07:18.016
I'm gonna give this to you.

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.522
Hang on.

01:07:23.554 --> 01:07:24.556
I'm gonna do it again.

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:27.358
If you can do that for us,
that'd be great.

01:07:31.096 --> 01:07:32.864
- Holy (bleep)!
- Get the (bleep) outta here.

01:07:32.896 --> 01:07:35.534
Get the hell outta here.

01:07:35.567 --> 01:07:36.534
Dude, come on.

01:07:36.568 --> 01:07:39.471
We gotta get...
we got find out what this is.

01:07:39.503 --> 01:07:40.771
That is crazy.

01:07:40.804 --> 01:07:42.940
We're coming towards you,
we hear you.

01:07:42.974 --> 01:07:44.643
What the (bleep)?

01:07:44.675 --> 01:07:46.577
Jeez!

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:49.447
Don't fall on that, jeez!

01:07:51.048 --> 01:07:53.418
Guys, here's the girls.

01:07:53.451 --> 01:07:54.586
Come here, come here,
quick, quick.

01:07:54.619 --> 01:07:55.554
Why?

01:07:55.586 --> 01:07:58.590
Come here.

01:07:58.623 --> 01:07:59.724
Don't scare me.

01:07:59.757 --> 01:08:00.858
We're getting knocks.

01:08:00.891 --> 01:08:02.126
We would hit the tree

01:08:02.159 --> 01:08:04.995
and ask it to knock,
like, back.

01:08:05.028 --> 01:08:09.735
It was literally
doing it back.

01:08:09.768 --> 01:08:12.103
You ain't kiddin'
when you think there's, like,

01:08:12.137 --> 01:08:14.706
eyes all over you.

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:17.576
Things are looking at us.

01:08:34.993 --> 01:08:35.961
Did you hear that?

01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:37.127
It sounds like
an Indian flute or something.

01:08:37.162 --> 01:08:39.997
Guys. Guys.

01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:42.399
That was back that way.

01:08:42.434 --> 01:08:44.935
- That's a... that's a call.
- That's tribal.

01:08:44.969 --> 01:08:46.703
That sounds like
it's coming from

01:08:46.738 --> 01:08:48.874
where I just was.

01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:56.180
Like, way back there.

01:08:56.212 --> 01:08:58.082
Who would be doing that?

01:08:58.115 --> 01:09:01.720
You guys. You guys.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.783
I don't know what to say,

01:09:32.817 --> 01:09:36.520
other than I feel like
I'm being watched

01:09:36.554 --> 01:09:39.055
from every angle.

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:42.493
Things are...

01:09:42.527 --> 01:09:46.497
knocking on command
when we're asking.

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:48.131
It's unreal here.

01:09:52.002 --> 01:09:54.139
I'm lost right now.

01:10:10.255 --> 01:10:11.823
Good night.

01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:27.972
Good night, guys.

01:10:28.006 --> 01:10:28.940
Good night, my man.

01:10:28.972 --> 01:10:30.509
Thank you all.

01:10:43.087 --> 01:10:45.590
Turning in.

01:10:45.622 --> 01:10:48.592
Wow.

01:10:48.626 --> 01:10:49.594
Man.

01:10:49.627 --> 01:10:55.233
Can't seem to go to bed early
at all here.

01:10:55.265 --> 01:10:58.135
Early being like 2:00.

01:11:14.217 --> 01:11:15.554
Oh my God,

01:11:15.587 --> 01:11:17.656
- the REM-Pod's going off.
- Hey, Brian.

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:19.958
The REM-Pod's going off!

01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:21.960
The REM-Pod!

01:11:21.993 --> 01:11:23.261
- What?
- What happened?

01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:29.868
The REM-Pod's going off.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.938
- No!
- The REM-Pod's going off.

01:11:33.971 --> 01:11:37.108
It's... it's going.

01:11:47.784 --> 01:11:48.920
Look at that.

01:11:48.953 --> 01:11:50.689
I'm scared.

01:11:53.858 --> 01:11:55.360
- It's going off.
- It's going off.

01:11:55.393 --> 01:11:57.895
- Whoa.
- All right.

01:11:57.929 --> 01:11:59.264
Guys, move the camera
this way now.

01:11:59.296 --> 01:12:01.365
It's okay.

01:12:04.935 --> 01:12:07.037
That's like something's
just grabbing it.

01:12:11.775 --> 01:12:15.113
That thing's going off.

01:12:17.948 --> 01:12:20.284
I told you that it wasn't
gonna leave us alone.

01:12:24.154 --> 01:12:26.858
We have the GoPro now.

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:29.059
The REM-Pod's going off.

01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:32.831
We're in the freakin' attic.

01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:35.032
We're literally...

01:12:35.065 --> 01:12:36.934
it's like going crazy
right now.

01:12:36.967 --> 01:12:38.235
You know what that is?

01:12:38.269 --> 01:12:39.204
I wanna see,

01:12:39.237 --> 01:12:41.672
but I'm also scared
to stick my head up.

01:12:48.445 --> 01:12:49.948
Can you see
the lights flashing?

01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.215
Yeah.

01:12:55.286 --> 01:12:58.056
It's not touching anything.

01:12:58.088 --> 01:13:00.692
Holy moly.

01:13:03.828 --> 01:13:06.264
Hey, wait, should we do
an EVP session or something?

01:13:06.296 --> 01:13:09.166
I mean, what was the purpose
of putting that thing there

01:13:09.199 --> 01:13:10.835
and then not do anything?

01:13:35.359 --> 01:13:38.296
It feels like it's
in the room with us.

01:13:38.328 --> 01:13:42.099
There's no way
I can close my eyes now.

01:13:42.132 --> 01:13:44.836
This place is not wanting us
to sleep.

01:15:29.006 --> 01:15:30.909
Oh.

01:15:30.942 --> 01:15:35.313
Whatever is here
stays here.

01:15:35.345 --> 01:15:37.447
Yeah, whatever is here
stays here.

01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:48.259
So it's been
a few weeks now

01:15:48.292 --> 01:15:50.595
since we've gotten back
from our shoot,

01:15:50.627 --> 01:15:55.098
and things are
happening here

01:15:55.131 --> 01:15:57.467
that were happening there.

01:15:57.501 --> 01:15:59.537
Vera's not sleeping.

01:15:59.569 --> 01:16:02.573
I've been having
a lot of nightmares.

01:16:06.978 --> 01:16:10.849
Very vivid nightmares,
very vivid dreams.

01:16:10.881 --> 01:16:14.985
Like, I'm actually
back at the farmhouse...

01:16:17.255 --> 01:16:19.390
...being harassed by something.

01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:27.231
And it was so intense
that I woke up.

01:16:27.265 --> 01:16:29.601
Well, as soon as I woke up,

01:16:29.634 --> 01:16:31.603
I saw a dark shadow standing

01:16:31.636 --> 01:16:34.239
right there in the corner
of my bedroom.

01:16:34.271 --> 01:16:35.974
I'm doing this video
strictly because

01:16:36.006 --> 01:16:37.375
things have happened
since I've been there

01:16:37.408 --> 01:16:38.943
and I've not witnessed this,

01:16:38.975 --> 01:16:43.046
I've not had anything
like this happen

01:16:43.079 --> 01:16:45.082
after any investigation
that I've been on.

01:16:45.115 --> 01:16:48.319
It started with dreams.

01:16:48.351 --> 01:16:53.291
I have seen shadows

01:16:53.323 --> 01:16:56.426
that seem like
out of the corner of my eye,

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.462
like someone is in the house.

01:17:02.065 --> 01:17:04.101
My daughter heard
a disembodied voice

01:17:04.135 --> 01:17:05.403
the other day.

01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:06.670
What happened?

01:17:06.703 --> 01:17:11.041
I-I-I...
when you were asleep,

01:17:11.074 --> 01:17:15.212
I heard a Grinch voice,
and, like, what is this?

01:17:15.246 --> 01:17:17.448
Wait, wait, wait,
you heard what?

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.283
It was now?

01:17:19.317 --> 01:17:24.354
It was when you were asleep
and it was...

01:17:24.387 --> 01:17:26.123
Right now?

01:17:26.157 --> 01:17:27.391
I don't know.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:31.162
My son woke up
and he told me

01:17:31.194 --> 01:17:32.329
the lights were flickering.

01:17:32.363 --> 01:17:37.435
This is what it was doing,
on and off, just like that,

01:17:37.467 --> 01:17:39.136
you see that light up there?

01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:40.371
That's what it was doing.

01:17:40.404 --> 01:17:42.140
So I thought it was odd.

01:17:42.172 --> 01:17:44.608
Then I realized
there was something else

01:17:44.641 --> 01:17:49.680
that may make this story
or these experiences

01:17:49.713 --> 01:17:53.184
a little bit more meaningful.

01:17:53.216 --> 01:17:56.219
I was gifted...
I was gifted with something.

01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:00.590
I brought a doll back.

01:18:08.698 --> 01:18:12.970
I can't tell you if the doll
is the reason why

01:18:13.003 --> 01:18:15.038
I'm drawn to the place

01:18:15.072 --> 01:18:19.042
or that I'm having,
you know, dreams,

01:18:19.076 --> 01:18:21.212
lights are coming on,
or whatever.

01:18:21.244 --> 01:18:22.980
But this is a first.

01:18:23.014 --> 01:18:28.152
I did bring home some dirt
from the Conjuring house.

01:18:33.356 --> 01:18:35.259
I have this,
I brought this home.

01:18:35.292 --> 01:18:38.129
This is the nail
from the attic

01:18:38.162 --> 01:18:39.364
that we opened up.

01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:51.041
I'm just wondering if we've
immersed ourselves too far.

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:52.342
I hope not.

01:18:54.645 --> 01:18:58.082
I really, really hope
that this is all in our heads.

01:19:02.752 --> 01:19:04.588
What's going on?

01:19:04.622 --> 01:19:06.057
What is that?

01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:08.292
Is that toy going off
on its own?

01:19:08.324 --> 01:19:10.528
- That's kinda creepy, huh?
- Let's have some fun!

01:19:11.628 --> 01:19:14.564
Let's have some fun...

01:19:14.597 --> 01:19:16.266
Let's have some fun!

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.069
It was the microphone.

01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:20.470
Let's have some fun...

01:19:20.503 --> 01:19:24.207
Let's have some fun!

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:39.269
