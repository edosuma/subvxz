WEBVTT

00:25.426 --> 00:27.541
I told we should've taken my dad's convertible.

00:27.741 --> 00:29.540
It's just a little traffic. Chill.

00:30.137 --> 00:32.110
The sun will be down
by the time we get to the Keys.

00:32.773 --> 00:35.456
Like you care. You spray on tan.

00:36.122 --> 00:40.408
You know what this is.
This is the last vacation I go on with you.

00:41.299 --> 00:43.961
Amy, say that again, I'll think
you mean it.

00:49.016 --> 00:51.759
This is the last vacation
I go on with you.

00:52.865 --> 00:56.100
What was that?! Oh, my god!

00:59.814 --> 01:01.715
Get off the bridge!

01:07.651 --> 01:10.116
Back up! Justin, back up!
We're gonna drown! Hurry!

01:10.896 --> 01:11.907
I'm trying! I'm trying!

01:12.065 --> 01:13.801
Back up! Back up!
Justin, come on!

01:30.194 --> 01:31.527
We're gonna die!

02:57.276 --> 02:59.044
The bridge fell out?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.915
We couldn't believe it.

03:11.927 --> 03:13.322
There was no warning.

03:21.406 --> 03:24.097
Gentlemen, thank you for cutting
your vacations short.

03:24.177 --> 03:25.541
No problem.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.410
So, this boat slams into a bridge.
Is that a crime scene?

03:28.410 --> 03:32.268
The witnesses say that the boat
was aiming at the bridge.

03:32.544 --> 03:34.426
All right, we'll grab our stuff.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.448
The boat was on autopilot.

03:57.455 --> 04:00.840
Yacht was reported stolen
out of the marina an hour ago.

04:01.182 --> 04:02.379
Did you find the driver?

04:02.448 --> 04:05.130
Found someone: Only soul on board.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.524
Italian suit, street shoes.

04:07.804 --> 04:10.731
Not the kind of thing you'd wear
for a day on the intercoastal.

04:13.158 --> 04:17.320
And that stippling right here,
which means he was shot at close range.

04:17.706 --> 04:20.240
Shooter went overboard right here.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.487
We've put frogmen in the water.

04:24.495 --> 04:25.634
Nothing so far.

04:25.702 --> 04:27.975
Shoot a man, you jump ship

04:31.765 --> 04:35.531
and then you crash a bridge.
That couldn't have been
the original plan, right?

04:35.651 --> 04:37.900
Mhm. It would attract too much attention.

04:38.451 --> 04:40.569
It certainly would.

04:44.321 --> 04:47.050
No exit ramp for our well-dressed man.

04:47.248 --> 04:49.095
I'll extract the bullet at the post.

04:49.302 --> 04:51.276
Get an I.D. Yet, alexx?

04:53.670 --> 04:55.903
Reed Williams, age 51.

04:56.089 --> 04:57.300
Bal Harbor.

04:57.603 --> 05:00.202
Well, that explains the expensive suit.

05:00.311 --> 05:03.210
Got a casing: .22.

05:07.605 --> 05:11.748
I'm going to go see what
Mr. Williams was into, ladies.
Thank you.

05:22.611 --> 05:24.417
I may kill Speedle.

05:24.505 --> 05:26.317
He borrow your kit again?

05:26.582 --> 05:28.747
"Borrow" implies I gave permission.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.800
Okay.

05:31.851 --> 05:33.808
I will tape lift.

05:42.285 --> 05:44.194
Miami-Dade police.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.472
Did you find my son?

05:47.478 --> 05:50.090
Reed went out to get our son back.

05:50.181 --> 05:52.061
Get your son back from who, ma'am?

05:52.088 --> 05:53.294
We don't know.

05:53.312 --> 06:00.222
They called, they said they had Joey, asked for ransom.
Reed went out to pay them almost three hours ago.
I haven't heard a word since.

06:00.317 --> 06:02.386
Was he supposed to meet
these people on a boat?

06:02.627 --> 06:05.996
Yeah, slip 29, like they said.

06:06.146 --> 06:07.968
Where is my husband?

06:09.979 --> 06:11.945
Mrs. Williams, I, um...

06:12.098 --> 06:15.914
I'm very sorry to inform you
that your husband has been killed.

06:17.913 --> 06:19.565
Oh, no.

06:24.497 --> 06:26.446
This is Joey.

06:28.226 --> 06:31.742
And I wrote down
everything that they said.

06:31.765 --> 06:34.013
Please lay that on the table.

06:34.178 --> 06:35.617
Thank you.

06:38.757 --> 06:40.578
Three million dollars in jewels.

06:40.670 --> 06:42.590
Did these people know you had these jewels?

06:42.855 --> 06:45.016
We're in the paper a lot.

06:45.044 --> 06:46.722
You know: events, fund-raisers...

06:47.066 --> 06:49.516
Did your husband take the
jewels to meet these people?

06:49.591 --> 06:51.336
To pay for Joey.

06:51.336 --> 06:52.745
They haven't called.

06:52.752 --> 06:54.231
There hasn't been a second call.

06:54.324 --> 06:56.681
Why would they take the
jewelry and not give us Joey?

06:56.758 --> 07:01.099
Hang on. Let's go back to the beginning.
Where was Joey taken from?

07:01.315 --> 07:03.309
From martial arts class.

07:03.863 --> 07:05.586
It happened about four hours ago.

07:05.755 --> 07:08.716
We'll need the address
and this photo of Joey.

07:08.957 --> 07:14.733
- We'll also need your DNA as a
reference in case he's, um...
- He's dead. I know.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.903
Let's not go there yet.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.901
Why don't you show me to Joey's room?

07:19.912 --> 07:21.595
It's... It's right this way.

07:24.463 --> 07:26.809
Speed, how's it going?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.103
Frogmen didn't turn anyone up.

07:29.871 --> 07:34.340
I did get some soil on the, uh,
point where the shooter went into the water.

07:34.516 --> 07:36.258
I don't know how instructive
it's going to be.

07:36.324 --> 07:38.997
I think we have a kidnapping
situation here. A six-year-old boy.

07:39.631 --> 07:40.719
Who's our dead guy?

07:40.808 --> 07:41.998
The boy's father.

07:42.142 --> 07:46.183
And I think the situation went south,
so that mud might be our only
connection to the suspect.

07:46.218 --> 07:47.597
I'm on it.

07:56.194 --> 07:57.221
Check this out.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.257
Ransom could've fit in this bag.

08:07.109 --> 08:08.295
It's a fish.

08:08.296 --> 08:11.152
Might've just given ourselves a
secondary crime scene right here.

08:11.384 --> 08:12.371
How do you figure?

08:12.579 --> 08:14.449
I'll explain once I get back to the lab.

08:14.663 --> 08:15.827
In the meantime, you, uh...

08:15.980 --> 08:18.675
you missed a spot over there.

08:22.130 --> 08:25.346
Kidnapping? Well, I thought
it was just a custody thing.

08:25.427 --> 08:26.406
What custody thing?

08:26.497 --> 08:29.072
Well, these rich parents are
always fighting over their kids.

08:29.124 --> 08:32.643
Divorce. You know, one'll send a P.I.
To swoop in, grab his kid after practice.

08:32.654 --> 08:36.135
But you just said that Joey Williams
never made it into practice.

08:36.231 --> 08:38.058
I went out front.

08:38.107 --> 08:39.912
It was, like... 10 past 8.

08:40.004 --> 08:43.404
I saw a mercedes S-class trying
to shut the door on the kid.

08:43.464 --> 08:45.350
I get close and the guy just drives off.

08:45.410 --> 08:46.408
One man driving?

08:46.484 --> 08:47.739
Well, as far as I could tell.

08:47.817 --> 08:50.201
Okay, show me exactly where
this car was. Show me.

08:50.290 --> 08:54.672
The mercedes was parked here.
It pulled out this way,
made a left at the street.

08:55.842 --> 08:58.148
A 66-inch wheelbase, Ken.

08:58.282 --> 09:00.247
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

09:00.251 --> 09:02.383
What it should mean to
you is that you're lying,

09:02.562 --> 09:09.189
because the S-class has a 62-inch
wheelbase, and it means that
it couldn't have been the abduction car.

09:09.273 --> 09:12.261
Kidnappers work in teams.
Are you in on this?

09:12.338 --> 09:13.829
- No.
- No?

09:13.983 --> 09:19.985
I need to find out what's going on here.
If this kid gets killed, you are all in.
You understand?

09:21.857 --> 09:27.719
Okay, the guy gave me an envelope
through a cracked window, it was tinted,
I never saw his face.

09:27.839 --> 09:29.886
You basically got paid
to look the other way.

09:30.085 --> 09:32.408
Like I said, I though
it was a custody thing.

09:33.317 --> 09:35.202
The envelope?

09:36.254 --> 09:41.009
Now, Ken, tell me what kind of car
it was and don't make me get down
there and measure again.

09:41.168 --> 09:43.205
It was like a pontiac...

09:43.439 --> 09:46.034
midsize. A Grand Prix, maybe.

09:46.151 --> 09:49.290
All right. I'll put out a
broadcast: "Stolen Grand Prix".

09:49.508 --> 09:53.911
"Stolen Grand Prix, all colors."
They've had five hours to repaint it.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.318
All right, which one of you
stole my crimelight?

10:02.388 --> 10:05.090
Well, "stole" is, is very negative.

10:05.316 --> 10:09.325
I-I had borrowed it, and, uh,
I-I replaced it. I put it back.

10:09.409 --> 10:13.372
Well, it would be nice if you charged it first.
I was at the scene and it flatlined.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.340
Sounds like she's mad at you.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.604
Calleigh, I sincerely apologize.

10:18.765 --> 10:21.472
Apology accepted. Give me yours.

10:21.527 --> 10:23.697
Go ahead. It's in my kit.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.994
Hope she doesn't need
her sodium rhodizonate.

10:32.161 --> 10:35.339
Confirmation. Triploid grass carp.

10:35.339 --> 10:41.281
It's, uh, specifically engineered to
control aquatic vegetation in the canals.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.462
The county dumps them.

10:44.545 --> 10:47.347
They eat five times their weight in plants.

10:50.357 --> 10:54.810
Well, Nemo there is, uh, eight inches long,
so he was just released.

10:54.892 --> 11:00.928
All right, so, uh, we find out what canal,
we'll be able to figure out where our
suspect was prior to the ransom handoff.

11:03.815 --> 11:07.119
600 square miles of waterways in Miami.

11:07.211 --> 11:10.219
That's okay. We can narrow it down.
The county needs a permit to dump carp.

11:10.329 --> 11:14.708
So... Let's enter the carp size to
find the date and location of the dump.

11:14.776 --> 11:16.017
You got something?

11:16.224 --> 11:22.723
Yeah. Canal number 3329 on Newberry
Road between 103rd and Fountain.

11:38.705 --> 11:40.164
Eric.

11:43.613 --> 11:46.061
The right kind of treads for a Grand Prix.

11:46.061 --> 11:49.333
That's right. The car went in right here.

11:55.085 --> 11:56.075
Okay.

11:56.075 --> 11:58.177
You're going in, Eric.

12:34.066 --> 12:35.261
Nothing.

12:35.346 --> 12:39.444
No sign of the boy inside the car and too
much pressure to pop the trunk open.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.108
Let's fish it out of there.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.442
Take a look at that.

13:06.639 --> 13:08.773
Fingernail marks right there.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.561
Look at this.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.616
A long blond hair.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.259
Just like Joey's.

13:19.259 --> 13:22.434
So they had him locked in here, Eric.

13:26.451 --> 13:30.075
It's good. If they were going to kill Joey,
they would've left him in here.

13:30.167 --> 13:32.440
Makes the good news the bad news,
doesn't it?

13:32.468 --> 13:34.006
How do you mean?

13:34.265 --> 13:35.456
They still have him.

13:46.078 --> 13:50.525
Car belongs to a couple in Seaside.
They reported it stolen two days ago.

13:50.578 --> 13:53.521
I'll process this at CSI,
see if I can pull any prints.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.517
Okay, thank you, Calleigh.
You said there was another problem.

13:56.589 --> 13:59.372
Department of Infrastructure
wants jurisdiction over the boat.

13:59.619 --> 14:01.570
They're towing it out
of the water right now.

14:01.754 --> 14:07.372
Okay, Eric, go back to the boat
and inform DOI that our murder
supersedes their bridge failure, please.

14:07.448 --> 14:08.555
All right. Got it.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.965
So kidnappers sank the car to hide it?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.373
Yes, they did.
They attempted to destroy evidence.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.151
But they left us a Calling card.
Look at this.

14:16.202 --> 14:17.873
Footprints.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.144
Joey put up a struggle.

14:20.236 --> 14:23.172
He was running. This way.

14:33.014 --> 14:35.414
This is where they grabbed him.

14:40.081 --> 14:42.402
Okay, have your officer alert the mother.

14:42.563 --> 14:43.991
Horatio?

14:44.134 --> 14:47.570
I think they're gonna try
and cash in the second time.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.782
Two months before this bridge is
retrofitted and this happens.

15:02.871 --> 15:06.528
Yeah well, you've got your
problems and I've got mine.

15:06.611 --> 15:08.148
We haven't released
the crime scene yet.

15:08.182 --> 15:09.791
Your crime scene's part
of a bridge failure.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.414
Well, the murder trumps
the bridge, okay?

15:12.475 --> 15:14.187
So you're going to have
to relinquish the boat.

15:14.187 --> 15:16.721
You CSI guys have been dusting
and tape-lifting for five hours.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.343
What else are you planning
on doing to the thing?

15:21.638 --> 15:22.791
Have a look at that.

15:23.508 --> 15:24.957
You see that?

15:25.968 --> 15:28.587
Must've been jarred loose
when the boat was towed.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.373
I'm going to have to search
the exterior of this vessel.

16:06.181 --> 16:10.447
Got what looks like over $3 million in jewelry.
I'm going to need two more officers.

17:01.463 --> 17:05.786
A palm. It's not as easy as a fingerprint.
Lot more surface to scan and compare.

17:05.824 --> 17:11.019
I know, but will you call me immediately
if you get a hit? We're coming up on eight
hours since the Williams boy was abducted.

17:11.060 --> 17:14.134
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

17:15.290 --> 17:19.439
I thought you'd want to know:
I ran the hairs you found in the car trunk.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.952
They're a match to Joey Williams.

17:21.068 --> 17:23.401
Did you confirm them against
the DNA for the parents?

17:23.462 --> 17:26.559
Well, parent. Your dead man
from the boat is his father.

17:26.685 --> 17:29.638
- That leaves us with Mrs. Williams.
- The stepmother.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.192
Yeah. No blood relation.

17:32.393 --> 17:34.920
Good to know. Thank you, Valera.

17:38.142 --> 17:39.990
So these diamonds were
hanging off the boat?

17:40.222 --> 17:42.260
Yeah. Why? What's up?

17:42.561 --> 17:46.021
- Nothing. They're fake.
- You're sure?

17:46.085 --> 17:48.905
You're the fish expert,
but I know gems.

17:49.050 --> 17:51.545
This is the latest thing:
Laboratory-grown diamonds.

17:51.689 --> 17:52.996
Like zirconium?

17:53.287 --> 17:55.933
No, they're real diamonds,
they're just manmade.

17:56.068 --> 17:59.452
Fraction of the price of
diamonds from a mine.

18:00.398 --> 18:06.836
Take a piece of pure graphite, put it in a
ceramic box, with some chemicals, then
slide the whole thing into a pressure cooker.

18:06.910 --> 18:11.018
It simulates the temperature and the pressure
15 miles below the earth's surface.

18:11.069 --> 18:12.488
Graphite vaporizes.

18:12.541 --> 18:17.656
After three days,
they pull out the ceramic box,
break it open, and get a diamond crystal.

18:17.899 --> 18:20.537
Just like nature,
only a million times faster.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.751
Gentlemen, are these the emeralds?

18:22.888 --> 18:24.339
Yeah, we were just about to check 'em.

18:24.515 --> 18:24.828
Okay.

18:26.174 --> 18:27.530
Now, wait a second.

18:27.570 --> 18:31.128
This emerald has a scrape on it.
You can't scrape a real emerald.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.391
What's the tool mark?

18:32.575 --> 18:36.400
It's not a tool mark. It's a tooth mark.
Look at the striae pattern.

18:44.077 --> 18:45.307
It's a chipped tooth.

18:45.409 --> 18:49.051
Mr. Williams got shot for
passing fake jewelry.

18:51.031 --> 18:52.401
Here. Take it.

18:54.856 --> 18:55.793
These are fake!

18:55.980 --> 18:57.080
No, they're not.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.297
Liar.

19:03.882 --> 19:05.242
That's not possible.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.854
Our jewelry's real.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.466
We don't own replicas.

19:08.825 --> 19:10.030
Did your husband know that?

19:11.594 --> 19:13.375
Meaning what?

19:13.799 --> 19:16.237
Meaning that it's possible
that you swapped

19:16.390 --> 19:19.922
out the fake ones for the real
ones and didn't tell him.

19:19.965 --> 19:21.497
You sent him in with a fake ransom.

19:21.589 --> 19:23.095
That sounds like a two-fer.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.386
Gets rid of the old man.

19:24.620 --> 19:28.574
Now you can collect on insurance
money for jewelry you never
lost in the first place.

19:28.722 --> 19:32.543
You think I'd put my son's
life at risk like that?

19:32.767 --> 19:36.934
Don't you mean your stepson?
You neglected to mention that,
didn't you.

19:37.214 --> 19:40.243
We're a blended family.
We don't use those terms.

19:40.311 --> 19:41.915
You see, the problem, Mrs. Williams,

19:41.975 --> 19:46.760
is that you've withheld information
and it makes you look complicit
in his abduction.

19:51.248 --> 19:56.049
We got the jewelry appraised last year.

19:56.923 --> 19:59.212
A lot can happen in a year.

19:59.388 --> 20:00.208
Now...

20:00.385 --> 20:03.352
Who else had access to those jewels?

20:04.321 --> 20:06.078
Just me and my husband.

20:06.222 --> 20:07.761
We keep them in the vault.

20:07.929 --> 20:10.496
Did you ever have them cleaned?

20:10.648 --> 20:12.229
After events, sure.

20:12.774 --> 20:14.098
At McCauley jewelers.

20:14.257 --> 20:15.734
McCauley jewelers, Speed.

20:15.895 --> 20:16.944
Thank you.

20:17.427 --> 20:19.991
Nice Rolls. Probably the owner's.

20:20.209 --> 20:22.390
Cars are such a bad investment.

20:22.527 --> 20:23.694
I'm just happy I have my bike.

20:23.755 --> 20:26.099
Someday, you made need
something with doors.

20:26.132 --> 20:27.764
Well, I got plenty of time for that.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.118
We're here to see Mr. McCauley, please.

20:35.223 --> 20:37.508
Oh, Mr. McCauley is the previous owner.

20:37.556 --> 20:38.945
I'm the new owner.

20:39.185 --> 20:40.739
Rudolph Koehler. Call me Rudy.

20:42.394 --> 20:45.505
But maybe I can help you
with something, officer.

20:45.865 --> 20:48.281
I'd be more than happy
to help the police.

20:48.432 --> 20:52.499
Yes, I've recently been speaking to
your customer, Mrs. Tawny Williams.

20:53.654 --> 20:56.549
Yes, I just heard the news
about her husband.

20:56.695 --> 20:58.088
It's tragic.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.249
She's such a nice lady.

21:00.430 --> 21:00.856
Excuse me.

21:01.065 --> 21:02.043
Speed?

21:05.420 --> 21:06.709
Stay put.

21:07.858 --> 21:12.220
She and her husband were
very good customers.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.067
Speed!

21:41.010 --> 21:43.244
This is CSI Caine.
We got a priority here!

21:43.298 --> 21:44.985
I got a man down, shots fired!

21:46.271 --> 21:47.475
You're going to be okay, speed.

21:47.849 --> 21:48.813
You're going to be okay.

21:49.190 --> 21:50.040
You'll be fine.

21:50.243 --> 21:51.877
I can't feel anything.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.641
Hang in there.

21:53.794 --> 21:54.684
Speed.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.136
Speed, keep breathing.

21:57.627 --> 21:58.308
Speed...

21:58.308 --> 21:59.921
Can't feel anything...

21:59.974 --> 22:01.477
I know, I know, I understand.

22:01.637 --> 22:02.904
Just keep breathing.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.027
Okay, partner.

22:04.376 --> 22:05.623
Speed?

22:07.332 --> 22:08.430
Speed.

22:09.721 --> 22:12.007
Speed... Speed...

22:13.320 --> 22:15.969
All units, shots fired. Officer down
McCauley jewelers.

22:19.002 --> 22:20.525
253 Adam en route.

22:22.009 --> 22:23.012
Speed.

23:06.487 --> 23:08.283
Give him to me, Horatio.

23:11.482 --> 23:13.624
He needs to go with me.

23:17.988 --> 23:19.238
Okay.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.895
Okay.

23:29.882 --> 23:31.085
Hey.

23:33.266 --> 23:40.167
Okay, um I know you need to start
processing the firearms evidence.
This is mine, and that's Speed's.

23:41.437 --> 23:43.828
Is there anything I need to
know about the shooting?

23:44.221 --> 23:45.168
Uh, well...

23:45.465 --> 23:47.229
A lot of confusion.

23:47.638 --> 23:48.732
And?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.846
And, uh...

23:50.967 --> 23:53.869
Speed may have had to look at his gun.

23:55.266 --> 23:56.429
Okay.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.641
That was quick - IAB.

24:01.858 --> 24:02.652
I'm out.

24:02.820 --> 24:04.200
Okay.

24:07.825 --> 24:09.037
I'm sorry.

24:09.501 --> 24:10.841
There's nothing worse.

24:13.647 --> 24:14.987
Thank you, Rick.

24:15.407 --> 24:18.070
It's an officer involved shooting.
You know I got to work it.

24:18.103 --> 24:20.532
Yes, the body is still warm.

24:20.576 --> 24:23.800
Unfortunately, that's the best
time for me to be here.

24:24.509 --> 24:26.723
- Where's Speedle's weapon?
- See Calleigh.

24:26.812 --> 24:29.018
- And yours?
- See Calleigh.

24:29.347 --> 24:30.946
You should sit down with a counselor.

24:31.088 --> 24:36.198
Only therapy I need is finding the
Williams boy, but thanks for the offer.

24:47.363 --> 24:51.352
Patrol picked him up two blocks away.
He only speaks bulgarian.
Now we're waiting on a translator.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.731
- I am not going to wait.
- Horatio.

25:00.507 --> 25:02.319
film at 11:00.

25:05.862 --> 25:08.088
I'm going to put you in the car.

25:19.119 --> 25:21.406
- Where is the boy?
- What boy?

25:21.489 --> 25:25.693
Rudy, do not play with me.

25:26.132 --> 25:28.499
We swap stones on jewelry.
I don't know anything about a boy.

25:28.510 --> 25:31.991
You didn't conspire with Mrs.
Williams to kidnap her own son,
is that what you're telling me?

25:32.076 --> 25:34.000
What? Kidnap?

25:34.076 --> 25:35.645
I barely know Mrs. Williams.

25:35.854 --> 25:37.225
I may be a thief, but that's all.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.997
Who were the gunmen inside, then?

25:39.175 --> 25:40.577
Security, I hire them.

25:40.746 --> 25:43.116
But only to protect the stones.

25:45.308 --> 25:47.502
He goes nowhere.

26:25.352 --> 26:27.348
Oh, Speedle.

26:32.172 --> 26:33.427
Detective.

26:33.427 --> 26:36.082
Are you working on the evidence
from the jewelry store shooting?

26:36.339 --> 26:37.942
I'm just starting, actually.

26:38.110 --> 26:39.346
Each case is unique.

26:39.491 --> 26:43.195
However, the last time Speedle
was involved in a shooting,
his service pistol misfired.

26:43.545 --> 26:45.369
I vaguely remember that.

26:45.722 --> 26:47.166
One misfire is bad luck.

26:47.374 --> 26:49.876
Two is usually bad gun maintenance.

26:50.021 --> 26:52.436
Well, I haven't started
examining Speedle's gun.

26:52.796 --> 26:54.916
And like you said,
every case is unique.

26:55.475 --> 26:58.883
- Just "cc" me on everything, please.
- Of course.

26:59.573 --> 27:02.645
So, we're looking for the print that
Calleigh found on the trunk of the car.

27:02.668 --> 27:05.476
She's been searching for a
palm print match for hours.

27:05.731 --> 27:07.225
Okay, Eric, hang in there.

27:07.481 --> 27:10.757
That little kid is out there
depending on this box.

27:11.966 --> 27:14.195
I hate it, I want to do something.

27:14.362 --> 27:17.450
I understand, but this is the course
of action, so let's keep going.

27:24.492 --> 27:25.957
Pete Keller.

27:25.957 --> 27:29.833
Priors for forgery, embezzlement,
fraud and theft.

27:30.122 --> 27:31.653
And now kidnapping.

27:31.798 --> 27:35.740
And Eric, if you want to do something,
let's get this guy Keller. He's got the kid.

27:48.612 --> 27:51.444
Let me see your hands. On the ground.
On the ground now.

27:53.095 --> 27:56.309
Put your hands behind your back,
hands behind your back now.

27:57.996 --> 27:59.678
Did you get anything?

28:00.168 --> 28:01.394
Found a weapon on him, sir.

28:01.762 --> 28:03.006
Ooh, a .22--

28:03.157 --> 28:05.372
just like the one that
killed Mr. Williams.

28:05.709 --> 28:07.087
Where's the boy, pete?

28:07.240 --> 28:09.041
I don't know who you're talking about.

28:11.701 --> 28:13.448
Got a chipped tooth, there, champ.

28:13.624 --> 28:14.964
Yeah, I busted it when I was a kid.

28:15.164 --> 28:19.263
No, you didn't.
You got it biting down on a fake emerald
before you shot Mr. Williams.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.484
Now, your plan went south,
and you had to scramble, didn't you?

28:27.708 --> 28:30.267
Jump ship, get back to shore,
get back to the kid.

28:30.516 --> 28:31.414
Where is he?

28:31.581 --> 28:32.255
I don't know.

28:32.424 --> 28:33.427
It's out of my hands now.

28:33.594 --> 28:34.308
Where did you stash him?

28:34.500 --> 28:35.625
Why don't you ask Tawny?

28:35.881 --> 28:37.212
Mrs. Williams?

28:37.429 --> 28:38.015
Yeah.

28:38.239 --> 28:39.853
It was all her idea.

28:56.855 --> 28:58.578
All right, let's try this.

29:35.012 --> 29:37.452
I got a hit on Keller's
known associates.

29:37.588 --> 29:38.462
Tawny Williams.

29:38.599 --> 29:41.775
That's right, only she went by
Sissy Huber back then.

29:42.367 --> 29:45.655
Sissy Huber. Tampa, Tallahassee.

29:45.801 --> 29:48.655
Fraud, theft, embezzlement.

29:48.816 --> 29:51.671
Look at their victims -
rich men in their 50s and 60s.

29:51.817 --> 29:55.161
Broke their hearts,
then broke their bank accounts,
didn't she?

29:55.385 --> 29:57.069
Let's bring her in.

29:57.557 --> 30:00.029
Lieutenant, I mean, really.

30:00.157 --> 30:02.435
Shouldn't I be home in
case someone calls?

30:03.533 --> 30:05.474
Someone like Pete Keller?

30:06.316 --> 30:09.953
Your boyfriend is in
custody for kidnapping.

30:17.095 --> 30:19.004
Pete did this?

30:19.935 --> 30:21.747
Well, I haven't seen Pete in years.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.700
He murders your husband,
he kidnaps your stepson

30:24.773 --> 30:27.531
and I'm to believe you haven't
seen him in years...

30:27.997 --> 30:29.753
Sissy?

30:30.499 --> 30:37.200
This is a list of known associates,
and it appears that you and Pete
have been separating people from
their money for quite awhile.

30:37.431 --> 30:39.692
Usually older, rich men.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.967
I ripped off rich guys.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.420
Okay?

30:46.014 --> 30:47.552
I admit it.

30:47.737 --> 30:50.345
We picked them out of the
society page in the herald.

30:50.345 --> 30:51.989
Is that how you found your husband?

30:52.105 --> 30:56.250
Yeah, he... Reed had just been widowed.

30:56.685 --> 30:56.885
He was like a prime target.

30:57.303 --> 30:58.177
Only this time, it was different.

30:59.668 --> 31:00.960
I fell in love with him.

31:02.227 --> 31:02.734
Okay?

31:02.957 --> 31:04.481
I fell in love with his son.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.814
You said I'd been hiding something.

31:07.785 --> 31:08.619
That's it.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.440
My past.

31:11.658 --> 31:14.200
I've been trying to make
some changes in my life.

31:15.589 --> 31:17.103
People do change.

31:18.895 --> 31:20.851
Please find him.

32:31.615 --> 32:33.269
Where's Joey, Pete?

32:33.782 --> 32:35.540
I told you. Ask Tawny.

32:35.628 --> 32:37.258
Although, she's still Sissy to me.

32:37.703 --> 32:43.593
Pete, you just got a CSI killed.
I suggest you take your last opportunity
and talk to me right now.

32:43.593 --> 32:46.158
You already got me for
murdering her old man

32:46.209 --> 32:49.703
- Why would I help you out ?
- Because the boy will be killed unless you do.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.776
Guess that will break
Sissy's heart, won't it.

32:51.847 --> 32:55.008
and isn't that, Pete, what you
are really interrested in.

32:56.171 --> 33:01.617
Have we processed the envelope with 100s
from Caine Timmins, the martial arts guy?

33:01.826 --> 33:03.518
The cash wasn't helpful,

33:04.256 --> 33:05.827
but the envelope was.

33:13.118 --> 33:14.811
Translation please.

33:15.468 --> 33:16.639
It's a bill.

33:16.856 --> 33:19.414
It is a bill for karate lessons

33:19.911 --> 33:22.654
The pay-off envelope,
it didn't come from Pete Keller.

33:22.838 --> 33:27.899
No. It came from inside the dojo which
means that Timmins and Keller are partners.

33:34.260 --> 33:36.706
Good thing he never cleans his store.

33:37.884 --> 33:39.354
Take a look at this.

33:39.749 --> 33:41.071
This is mud.

33:41.625 --> 33:44.110
Let's see what else is here.

33:44.687 --> 33:48.361
He's gonna take Joey somewhere he's
been before, someplace remote.

33:53.766 --> 33:55.740
No. I've got some kind of sap.

33:56.944 --> 33:58.807
I'm gonna rush this over to trace.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.890
Okay. I'll be on the cell.

34:15.562 --> 34:17.623
I keep thinking Speedle's
going to walk in.

34:19.018 --> 34:20.301
He's not.

34:21.529 --> 34:23.396
Just get me the sample.

34:32.106 --> 34:34.020
Mass spec's got something.

34:34.431 --> 34:36.045
Hydroxyphorboloxide.

34:36.130 --> 34:38.606
>From the manchineel tree.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.676
Only found in hell's bay.

34:40.762 --> 34:43.338
Where the ocean meets the glades.

34:43.616 --> 34:45.216
That's sharks and gators.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.303
This guy is slick.

34:47.047 --> 34:48.170
Slick? Why?

34:48.428 --> 34:49.478
H. Yeah

34:49.704 --> 34:50.938
He's got him in hell's bay.

34:51.130 --> 34:54.391
He can't bring himself to kill the kid, Eric.
He's going to let the sharks do it.

34:54.428 --> 34:56.112
Now there's one way in.
Meet me there.

35:41.510 --> 35:42.931
Joey

35:43.243 --> 35:44.429
Stay right there, son.
I'm coming to get you.

35:46.154 --> 35:47.628
I'm scared.

36:00.432 --> 36:03.143
You hang in there, Joey.

36:07.713 --> 36:09.269
Don't go in there.

36:10.609 --> 36:11.453
Stay here, kid.

36:11.613 --> 36:12.895
Where are you going?

36:42.481 --> 36:43.476
it's all right.

36:48.223 --> 36:49.201
Come on.

36:49.716 --> 36:51.537
Why don't you reach your hand?

36:53.982 --> 36:54.840
that a boy.

36:55.057 --> 36:56.637
There you go, right on my shoulder.

37:00.310 --> 37:01.241
I got you.

37:12.098 --> 37:13.157
All right, Buddy.

37:14.488 --> 37:15.997
Code four, Eric.

37:16.213 --> 37:17.989
Put it out. We've got the primary.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.312
Pizza? Okay, pizza.

37:27.456 --> 37:28.394
Mrs. Williams?

37:29.606 --> 37:30.657
Joey.

37:31.363 --> 37:32.612
Mommy!

37:32.743 --> 37:33.616
Joey.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.472
Hi. Oh, god. Oh.

37:37.010 --> 37:39.021
I thought I lost you.

37:40.105 --> 37:40.955
Oh!

37:49.080 --> 37:50.089
Thank you.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.087
It never occurred to me
that Pete was involved.

37:55.512 --> 37:56.955
That he would hurt a child.

37:57.147 --> 38:00.146
Well, Mrs. Williams, jealousy
is a powerful motivator.

38:00.636 --> 38:06.137
And Pete is going away for a long time,
so you guys are going to be safe now.

38:07.573 --> 38:10.126
I heard about your, your CSI.

38:12.562 --> 38:14.230
I'm sorry, really.

38:15.136 --> 38:15.955
Yeah.

38:17.102 --> 38:18.490
Thank you.

38:19.002 --> 38:20.519
Take care, partner.

38:22.733 --> 38:23.806
Thank you.

38:49.353 --> 38:50.628
You saved me.

38:51.646 --> 38:54.711
I wanted you to see this
before I gave it to Stetler.

38:58.993 --> 39:00.943
He definitely had to
look at his gun.

39:05.698 --> 39:07.959
"Lieutenant Caine's weapon
expended six rounds.

39:08.433 --> 39:13.517
"Tim Speedle's... Tim Seedle's
malfunctioned."

39:14.175 --> 39:15.812
There are many reasons for a misfire.
Aren't there?

39:16.678 --> 39:18.274
Faulty mechanism.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.797
Low-grade ammunition.

39:20.142 --> 39:22.197
Poor gun maintenance.

39:22.709 --> 39:26.415
Designation of any one of those would be
speculation on our part, wouldn't it?

39:26.648 --> 39:28.243
We never speculate.

39:28.475 --> 39:30.168
Bottom line, the gun malfunctioned.

39:30.635 --> 39:34.507
And that closes the IAB
investigation, doesn't it?

39:34.812 --> 39:37.673
Do you want me to help
you with Tim's things?

39:42.133 --> 39:43.234
No, thank you.

39:44.906 --> 39:46.015
Hey.

39:46.817 --> 39:48.181
Okay.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.559
You hang in there.
