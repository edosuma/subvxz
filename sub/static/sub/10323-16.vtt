It was nice bein' out of my coma
and back where I belonged,

00:06.174 --> 00:08.142
but I couldn't get
Billie off my mind.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.078
I was pretty sure
karma wanted me to find her.

00:10.144 --> 00:13.447
It's official. There's only
two Billy Cunninghams
in the phone book,

00:13.514 --> 00:16.984
and neither of those guys
thinks he's my soul mate.

00:17.051 --> 00:20.088
Billie, Billie, Billie.
Don't you wanna hear
what's been going on with us?

00:20.154 --> 00:22.956
Randy was our town crier
while you were comatose.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.825
That's actually
a clever play on words,

00:24.892 --> 00:27.295
in that he both recorded
the town happenings
and cried a lot.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.363
Read the list, dum-dum.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.501
"I got a notepad.
I got a paper cut.

Joy and family out of
their sideways trailer."

00:36.904 --> 00:38.739
That's right, Dip Van Winkle.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.109
Trailer's still on its side
since you knocked it over,

in the Crab Shack.

This is my spelling homework.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.251
Joy, I promise
I'll get your trailer
tipped right side up...

to rent a crane.

- Oh, and I'm a lesbian.
- [ Randy ] Catalina,
it's not your turn yet.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.269
Did I just hear
Chiquita Banana say
she isn't into bananas anymore?

01:08.336 --> 01:10.138
What happened?
Did you get a bad banana?

01:10.204 --> 01:13.174
It wasn't the bananas,
it was the trees
who waggle them around.

01:13.241 --> 01:16.977
In The Wizard of Oz,
the trees threw apples.
Trees are bastards.

01:17.044 --> 01:20.581
All men are bastards.
My father, who gambled me away
in a foosball game,

01:20.648 --> 01:25.119
and my childhood sweetheart,
who convinced me to come to
this country only to abandon me.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.256
Thanks to him, now I live
a fairy-tale life
of a maid and a stripper.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.424
Oh, please.
I know what you're up to.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.227
Pretending to be a lesbian will
probably double your business
at Club Chubby.

01:33.294 --> 01:37.631
When I was in high school,
I told my gym teacher I was
a lesbian just to get a "B."

01:37.698 --> 01:40.434
She hadn't called
my bluff in the shower,
I would've gotten an "A."

01:42.636 --> 01:45.939
The only person
I wanna strip for now
is Miss Right.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.876
Well, good luck.
I'm looking for
my Miss Right too.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.912
Damn, Earl.
You got Frank's car.
You got Frank's trailer.

01:51.979 --> 01:55.549

Joy's little insult
gave me an idea.

I'll find Billie-- Frank.

My name is Earl.

[ Earl Narrating ]
We found out because
of prison overcrowding,

Frank had been sent
to a halfway house.

I wasn't looking forward
to talking to Frank,

02:22.410 --> 02:25.078
seeing how
he used to date Billie
and he's crazy,

02:25.145 --> 02:26.980
but he was my only chance
at finding her.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.082
Oh, my God. Hey.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.885
- Oh, my God.
It's good to see you.
- So, how are you?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.821
Hungry. Really hungry.

They put tranquilizers
in our food to keep us down.

02:40.428 --> 02:43.397
I'm starving.
I-I actually ate
a bar of soap yesterday.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.499
This morning
I pooped bubbles.

02:45.566 --> 02:49.136

popping 'em.
It-It's crazy in here.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.372
You want a little fruit?

02:53.474 --> 02:56.310
I carry apple slices
in my pocket now.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.746
We haven't gotten
to that page yet.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.582
I gotta say,
you're looking good, Frank.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.785
Strong, healthy.
Beautiful necklace.

03:04.852 --> 03:09.357

for eight hours a day.

I thought we were here
to find Billie.
Remember?

03:48.762 --> 03:51.365
You said you were scared
because Frank used to date her.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.635
You also said that one of us
should do all the talking.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.704
It was you.
Go ahead, Earl.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wanna date Billie?

03:59.773 --> 04:02.443
Yes, and I just want you to know
that karma's on my side,

something bad will
happen to you.

04:04.945 --> 04:08.482

Don't worry about it.
I-I'm over her anyway.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.718
Really?
You're really over her?

04:10.784 --> 04:14.221
Yeah. Plus, she's living
a good life now,
like you.

04:14.288 --> 04:18.692

So, can you help me find Billie?

Yeah, I could do that,
but you gotta help me first.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.604
I need a job so I could
get outta here every day.

04:30.671 --> 04:34.542
Maybe we can get him a job
as a bikini inspector.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.844
I've seen the uniforms
on sale at the mall.

if Darnell would be
willing to hire him.

helping me find Billie.

would watch to the south,

more time with her,
he started to feel other things.

Stuart had once
hit a dog, brought it home
and nursed it back to health,

09:05.112 --> 09:08.749
and he thought
if the dog grew to love him,
why couldn't Billie?

09:08.816 --> 09:11.218
And finally, Billie woke up.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.220
So, no one knows who hit me?

Total mystery.
And since you don't remember,
I guess we'll never know.

But me--
How would you feel about me?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.410

she was in trouble...

and the cops had been
coming every day,
waiting to ask her questions.

she let him sneak her
out of the hospital.
