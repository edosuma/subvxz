WEBVTT

00:03.080 --> 00:04.240
4400 were taken

00:06.920 --> 00:07.880
4400 were returned

00:13.840 --> 00:15.280
Each has a unique ability

00:19.880 --> 00:21.120
One among them has a message

00:23.800 --> 00:25.240
Anyone can become extraordinary

00:28.400 --> 00:29.640
The risk is great

00:33.960 --> 00:35.040
But so are the rewards

00:38.560 --> 00:39.800
And now there's no truning back

00:40.080 --> 00:42.240
the world will have to
deal with us.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.440
<i>previously on the 4400...</i>

00:45.440 --> 00:47.120
these shots are free.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.840
give them
to anyone who wants them,

00:48.840 --> 00:51.040
but be careful
to explain the risks.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.960
i couldn't save her.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.200
there are
no guarantees.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.360
there never are.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.120
cassie dunlevy.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.680
maybe i'll see you around.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.600
you ever go visit
your cousin, shawn?

01:06.600 --> 01:07.920
is he getting any better?

01:07.920 --> 01:09.160
maybe someone should try
injecting him

01:09.160 --> 01:10.280
with a big old dose
of promicin.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.000
it'd be like giving him
a jump start, right?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.880
you know,
ever since the 4400 came back,

01:18.880 --> 01:20.840
it's been one sacrifice
after another.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.720
it has to stop.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.120
it worked, right?

01:25.120 --> 01:26.800
i-i'm not dead.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.720
not this time, no.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.480
next time,
you might not be so fortunate.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.120
they told you to kill me.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.040
you didn't do it.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.080
you ever think maybe

01:34.080 --> 01:35.520
that's why your
girlfriend is gone?

01:35.520 --> 01:38.400
i know you've been looking
for alana for three months.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.040
you must have considered
the possibility

01:40.040 --> 01:41.640
that she was abducted again.

i'm sorry, i...

02:03.760 --> 02:05.440
i didn't see you there.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.800
excuse me,
how did you get in here?

02:10.800 --> 02:13.280
okay, i don't understand--

02:14.240 --> 02:15.600
okay, this is too weird.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.800
i'm getting off.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.160
excuse me.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.240
i need to get out of here.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.640
i need to get out of here.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.640
no, please...

02:24.640 --> 02:25.600
no...

02:25.600 --> 02:26.720
please, no!

02:26.720 --> 02:27.840
no, i can't handle tight spaces!

02:27.840 --> 02:28.880
i can't breathe!

02:28.880 --> 02:30.640
i got to get out of here!

02:30.640 --> 02:33.280
get me out of here, please,
i can't breathe!

02:33.280 --> 02:35.040
help me, i can't breathe!

02:35.040 --> 02:37.000
no, i can't breathe!

02:37.000 --> 02:38.280
i can't breathe!

02:38.280 --> 02:39.800
help me, please, i can't...

02:41.160 --> 02:42.480
i can't...

02:55.560 --> 02:56.960
leave me alone!

02:59.680 --> 03:00.640
he's...

03:00.640 --> 03:02.240
he's going to kill me!

03:07.080 --> 03:08.360
no!

03:08.360 --> 03:09.760
leave me alone!

03:09.760 --> 03:11.360
stop, please!

03:11.360 --> 03:13.800
leave me alone!

03:18.960 --> 03:21.040
oh, god!

03:22.440 --> 03:27.040
see if he's got
a medical alert bracelet.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.160
hey...

03:38.160 --> 03:40.400
hello, tom.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.640
i heard about your sister.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.280
i figured
you might be showing up.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.240
yeah.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.320
ben and maia with you?

03:45.320 --> 03:46.760
no, they're in spain,
which is where i'll be

03:46.760 --> 03:48.040
as soon as i figure out
what happened to april.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.240
you working any leads?

03:50.240 --> 03:52.080
no one's seen
or spoken to her in months.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.320
i don't even know
if she's alive or dead.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.320
just because
she got her hands

03:55.320 --> 03:56.000
on a promicin shot

03:56.000 --> 03:57.040
doesn't mean
she took it.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.400
no, this is april
we're talking about.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.880
if she got the shot,
she took it.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.680
yeah, look,

04:02.680 --> 04:04.720
if there's anything i can do,

04:04.720 --> 04:05.800
anything you need,

04:05.800 --> 04:06.800
you just say the word.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.440
actually,

04:09.440 --> 04:11.240
i was hoping you could tell me
a little bit

04:11.240 --> 04:12.200
about your new boss.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.600
meghan doyle?

04:13.600 --> 04:15.560
she's young, inexperienced,
think-tank smart.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.640
spends a lot of time
in the theory room. why?

04:17.640 --> 04:21.120
i was thinking about asking
for temporary reinstatement.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.360
just hoping access
to ntac's resources

04:23.360 --> 04:24.800
will speed up my search.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.360
i'm not sure she'll go for

04:26.360 --> 04:27.560
the temporary assignment
kind of thing.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.640
then i guess
i'll just have to tell her

04:28.640 --> 04:29.640
that i'm back for good.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.920
so you're going to lie?

04:30.920 --> 04:33.000
this is my sister.
i'll do whatever it takes.

04:34.520 --> 04:39.480
okay, i'm so sorry
for dumping all this on you.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.280
because i know you've got
other things on your mind.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.480
is there any news on alana?

04:44.880 --> 04:46.000
i have to admit

04:46.000 --> 04:49.520
that the resemblance
is striking,

04:49.520 --> 04:52.360
and there's nothing about her
in any of these art books?

04:52.360 --> 04:52.920
all i know is

04:52.920 --> 04:54.840
that from june
to september, 1885,

04:55.320 --> 04:57.400
claude pierrot
painted six portraits

04:57.400 --> 04:58.320
of a woman named alana.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.400
who she was,

04:59.400 --> 05:00.640
what happened
to her afterwards,

05:00.640 --> 05:03.240
is all a blank, but that...

05:03.240 --> 05:04.600
that's her, diana,
that's alana.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.560
and you think
they sent her back into the past

05:06.560 --> 05:09.160
as some kind of punishment
for you not killing isabelle?

05:09.160 --> 05:10.760
i think the future
gave her to me

05:10.760 --> 05:12.680
and the future took her away.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.840
i guess there's no way
of ever finding out.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.320
maybe there is.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.680
i know how to contact
the future.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.000
i've done it before.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.240
oh, no,

05:21.240 --> 05:22.720
please tell me
you're not thinking

05:22.720 --> 05:24.720
of doing anything stupid.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.240
oh, tom...

05:29.240 --> 05:30.800
i will always
be grateful for you

05:30.800 --> 05:31.840
for getting maia back,

05:31.840 --> 05:33.240
but you attempted suicide.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.640
the only reason
they saved you last time

05:34.640 --> 05:35.880
was because they needed you.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.920
now, that's not the case
this time.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.560
it's been three months, diana.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.320
i don't know what else to do.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.360
wherever alana is,
whatever happened to her,

05:41.360 --> 05:42.680
she does not want you dead.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.640
yeah. baldwin.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.720
don't let them get me!

05:54.720 --> 05:57.200
please,
they're going to kill me!

05:57.200 --> 05:58.320
what you're
looking at

05:58.320 --> 05:59.600
is a highly elevated
fear response.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.440
in mr. kopelow's case,
it's a fear of clowns.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.920
but to have
that kind of reaction,

06:02.920 --> 06:04.320
doesn't there
need to be...

06:04.320 --> 06:06.320
you know,
actual clowns?

06:06.320 --> 06:08.560
that's what makes these cases
so unusual.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.400
there's no
external stimuli present.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.440
how many cases
are we talking about?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.600
eight in the last two hours,

06:14.600 --> 06:17.400
which is why
i called you.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.920
see, we all have things
that we're afraid of,

06:18.920 --> 06:20.040
insects, heights,

06:20.040 --> 06:21.040
but we learn
how to cope with them.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.000
in these people,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.880
those coping mechanisms
are turned off.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.040
they've seen
their worst fears

06:25.040 --> 06:26.400
come to life.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
and you think
a 4400 ability's behind this?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.640
someone or something

06:29.640 --> 06:31.920
is turning
their preexisting fears

06:31.920 --> 06:33.920
into unmanageable phobias.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.000
excuse me.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.760
well, eight cases
in two hours.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.120
i'd say someone's been
pretty busy, huh?

06:38.120 --> 06:41.000
for all we know,
they're just getting started.

06:42.920 --> 06:47.720
The 4400
Season 4 Ep2

06:59.240 --> 07:08.840
Capture:xxy¡¢lanmao¡¢QQ
Sync:FRM@mywsz

07:37.520 --> 07:40.080
you think one of my employees
drove those people crazy?

07:40.320 --> 07:41.000
look, all we know

07:41.000 --> 07:42.080
is that five
of our eight victims

07:42.080 --> 07:43.760
had receipts
from your branch's atm.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.960
according to
the transaction slips,

07:44.960 --> 07:46.400
they all used the machine

07:46.400 --> 07:48.520
some time between 7:12
and 7:28 this morning.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.720
the bank isn't even
open then.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.360
that means no one on my staff
is responsible, right?

07:52.360 --> 07:53.680
we're still going to
need everyone

07:53.680 --> 07:56.880
to submit to a promicin test,
just to be sure.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.160
tom...

07:58.160 --> 08:00.000
look at this.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.320
max kopelow.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.400
yup, and look who's
right behind him in line.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.480
jacqui glendon.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.280
our claustrophobia victim.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.280
there's no audio, but looks like
there's some kind of commotion

08:09.280 --> 08:12.000
just outside of camera range
right there.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.960
what do you think?

08:12.960 --> 08:13.600
we'll need a list

08:13.600 --> 08:15.040
of everyone who used
that atm this morning.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.200
i can get you that.
great.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.080
hey, sleeping beauty.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.040
hey...

08:24.040 --> 08:25.240
how does it feel to be awake?

08:25.240 --> 08:26.800
it feels
pretty good.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.360
you know they're
kicking me out of here today.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.480
you going home?

08:29.480 --> 08:31.000
that's fantastic.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.760
it'll make those media hounds
outside very happy.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.320
i might disappoint them
and sneak out the back.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.600
i don't know.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.720
i cannot believe

08:38.720 --> 08:40.320
how much catching up
i have to do.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.360
so much crazy stuff
has happened last three month

08:44.080 --> 08:44.760
change is painful.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.720
it comes with a cost.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.080
you're quoting
jordan collier now?

08:48.080 --> 08:50.480
you say that
like it's a bad thing.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.160
i didn't think
he'd go through with it,

08:55.160 --> 08:56.920
hand out all the promicin?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.160
he knew what would happen.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.280
he knew it would kill
all of those people.

09:00.280 --> 09:04.160
yeah, and i feel bad
for those people,

09:04.160 --> 09:07.360
but i've seen promicin
do some amazing things.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.400
i guess i should be
thanking you, huh?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.000
for what?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.120
come on, kyle.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.520
i overheard
the doctors talking.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.840
they said that
there was some kind of spike

09:15.840 --> 09:17.080
in my promicin level,

09:17.080 --> 09:18.560
and that's what
woke me up,

09:18.560 --> 09:21.080
and it was you and my mom
in the room when it happened,

09:21.080 --> 09:22.720
and i kind of doubt...

09:22.720 --> 09:25.200
that my mom could get her hands
on a shot.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.960
it had been three months, man.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.080
the doctors weren't sure
you were ever going to wake up.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.560
somebody had to try something.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.800
what about your dad?

09:33.800 --> 09:36.280
he's going to figure out
it was you.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.640
probably.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.960
san sebastian is one of
the most beautiful cities

09:40.960 --> 09:42.160
in the world,

09:42.160 --> 09:43.480
and that view of the bay
at night...

09:43.480 --> 09:45.000
it's pretty spectacular.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.120
which is why
if i dropped everything

09:47.120 --> 09:48.840
and moved there
with my daughter and boyfriend,

09:48.840 --> 09:50.480
i might find it
a little hard

09:50.480 --> 09:51.640
to give up.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.120
well, it wasn't
an easy decision.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.480
no, but knowing the separation
was only temporary

09:55.480 --> 09:57.040
must have made it easier.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.960
i'm not really sure
how long i'll be staying.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.400
it could be quite some time.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.840
at least
until you find your sister.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.520
look, diana,

10:05.520 --> 10:07.280
i know you've been trying
to track april on your own,

10:07.280 --> 10:08.640
and that you've hit
a brick wall,

10:08.640 --> 10:09.880
but you flash an ntac badge,

10:09.880 --> 10:11.240
it's amazing how fast

10:11.240 --> 10:12.640
those walls
come down.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.880
it's clear
what you get

10:13.880 --> 10:15.040
out of
this arrangement,

10:15.040 --> 10:16.760
but what's my win?

10:16.760 --> 10:18.080
me.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.080
i'm your win.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.880
temporary or not, you could use
another experienced agent here.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.840
that's pretty much

10:24.840 --> 10:26.240
what your former
partner, tom, said.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.480
smart guy.
you should listen to him.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.960
let me ask you a question.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.640
<i>have you ever seen
la dolce vita?</i>

10:37.960 --> 10:39.840
dubbed or subtitled?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.760
do i look like i watch
dubbed movies?

10:41.760 --> 10:43.720
do i?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.200
welcome back, agent skouris.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.200
i'm being reinstated
because i like foreign films?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.760
of course not,
but it doesn't hurt your cause.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.760
<i>transferring me?</i>

10:57.760 --> 10:58.960
<i>where?</i>

10:58.960 --> 11:00.080
it's a brand-new facility

11:00.080 --> 11:01.680
for people who've
developed abilities

11:01.680 --> 11:04.520
that the government
considers non-threatening.

11:06.680 --> 11:07.960
they're...

11:07.960 --> 11:09.120
kept on the inhibitor,

11:09.120 --> 11:10.360
<i>but otherwise,</i>

11:10.360 --> 11:11.320
<i>it's less
like a prison</i>

11:11.320 --> 11:12.760
<i>and more like a...</i>

11:12.760 --> 11:14.240
an internment camp?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.840
<i>there's an exercise yard,
a library that you can use,</i>

11:16.840 --> 11:18.080
and, of course,
you'll be allowed

11:18.080 --> 11:20.400
to interact with
the other inmates.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.560
<i>sounds nice.</i>

11:21.560 --> 11:23.480
<i>nicer than this place, anyway.</i>

11:23.480 --> 11:26.520
<i>then we'll arrange
for your transfer.</i>

11:26.520 --> 11:28.160
<i>but first,
we need you to sign this.</i>

11:30.640 --> 11:32.240
<i>it's a consent form,</i>

11:32.240 --> 11:33.840
giving us permission
to test your tolerance

11:33.840 --> 11:35.440
for promicin.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.000
<i>you want to see if i can get
my abilities back?</i>

11:38.000 --> 11:41.160
we want to make absolutely sure
that you can't.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.920
the substance that your
father injected you with

11:42.920 --> 11:43.880
negated your abilities,

11:43.880 --> 11:45.320
but before
we can move you

11:45.320 --> 11:46.640
to another facility,

11:46.640 --> 11:49.880
<i>we need to be positive
that they're never coming back.</i>

11:49.880 --> 11:52.120
<i>what if they do?
what then?</i>

11:52.120 --> 11:55.160
we're prepared to deal with
that contingency as well.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.640
this morning

11:59.640 --> 12:00.960
when you were
in line at the atm,

12:00.960 --> 12:02.160
do you remember seeing
this man?

12:02.160 --> 12:03.840
yeah, i wasn't really
paying any attention.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.120
i was on a business call.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.560
does ntac cover
your life insurance?

12:10.840 --> 12:12.880
did you notice anything unusual
while you were there?

12:12.880 --> 12:14.720
anyone's behavior
strike you as odd?

12:14.720 --> 12:16.200
there was this one guy.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.480
i think he was complaining
about the line.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.480
how long it was taking.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.160
what did he say exactly?

12:20.160 --> 12:22.720
he was yapping
about the bank being too cheap

12:22.720 --> 12:24.200
to spring for another atm.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.120
he's right about that,
by the way.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.040
what did he look like?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.240
20-something.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.920
i think he was wearing
kind of like a baseball cap.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
he was just
a regular guy.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.000
when do you ever
notice people at banks?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.040
unless they're robbing
the place, right?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.440
hey, tom...

12:36.440 --> 12:37.520
we got a no-show.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.200
thank you.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.320
mr. kennedy!

12:46.280 --> 12:48.520
i'm agent garrity, ntac.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.040
stop!

12:56.000 --> 12:57.360
okay...

12:57.360 --> 12:58.280
okay, stairs.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.160
i made up
your old room for you.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.320
okay.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.880
danny, why don't you
take your brother upstairs

13:04.880 --> 13:08.200
while i make
some lunch?

13:08.200 --> 13:09.560
how does
a tuna melt sound?

13:09.560 --> 13:10.600
that's my favorite.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.600
all right...

13:15.280 --> 13:16.440
come on, troy,
talk to us.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.240
why did you attack
those people, huh?

13:18.240 --> 13:20.720
you got a problem with
columbia fidelity bank, huh?

13:20.720 --> 13:22.040
or maybe you did it
for a laugh.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.880
you think screwing
with people's heads is funny?

13:23.880 --> 13:25.040
is that it?

13:25.040 --> 13:25.880
no.

13:25.880 --> 13:26.960
look, i admit i took promicin.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.120
i lost my job,

13:29.120 --> 13:30.680
i couldn't pay off
my credit cards,

13:30.680 --> 13:31.680
my girlfriend dumped me.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.760
i...

13:32.760 --> 13:34.400
i was desperate.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.840
i took the shot
to make my life better.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.600
better, better.
better how, huh?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.440
by driving
a bunch of people crazy?

13:39.440 --> 13:41.000
they're at abendson
psychiatric hospital,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.160
writhing around
in strait-jackets.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.760
it wasn't me, i swear.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.800
my ability's harmless.
i play music.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.200
i pick up any instrument,
and i'm like a virtuoso.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.480
really?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.200
well, i'll go home
and get my clarinet.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.680
guys...

13:53.680 --> 13:55.200
can you step out
for a sec?

14:01.480 --> 14:02.560
i just got off
the phone

14:02.560 --> 14:03.520
with the seattle p.d.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.720
there's been another...

14:04.720 --> 14:06.080
i don't even know what
to call them, phobia attack?

14:06.080 --> 14:08.240
yeah, pretty much says it.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.400
anyway, a 911 call came in
10 minutes ago

14:09.400 --> 14:10.560
from an apartment

14:10.560 --> 14:11.920
over on lakemont.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.200
seems the building manager
has been screaming like a madman

14:14.200 --> 14:15.640
about how the place
is covered in germs.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.960
we've had kennedy in custody
for hours.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.240
then he's not our guy,

14:19.240 --> 14:22.000
which means whoever's doing this
is still out there.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.600
great.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.640
all right.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.560
when do you have to get
the applications in?

14:28.560 --> 14:31.480
i've got another
month or so,

14:31.480 --> 14:32.680
that's even
if i apply.

14:32.680 --> 14:33.800
what do you mean "if?"

14:33.800 --> 14:35.360
i thought that
you were going to be

14:35.360 --> 14:36.680
the next clarence darrow.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.080
yeah, i thought so, too,

14:39.080 --> 14:40.480
but now,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
with everything that's going on,

14:42.480 --> 14:44.320
the world's a different place.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.240
you know, law school
just seems so meaningless.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.200
just because world's changed
doesn't mean that you have to.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.400
well, maybe
i want to.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.560
you know,
it's like the world's made up

14:51.560 --> 14:52.760
of two different classes now.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.200
you got people with abilities,

14:54.200 --> 14:55.480
who are capable
of amazing things,

14:55.480 --> 14:56.560
people like you,

14:56.560 --> 14:58.960
and then you got
the regular schmucks,

14:58.960 --> 15:00.400
who just have to
deal with the fact

15:00.400 --> 15:02.000
they're a little less special
than they could be.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.280
you know...

15:09.280 --> 15:11.200
i've been thinking about it
a lot,

15:11.200 --> 15:12.840
and...

15:12.840 --> 15:14.560
i want to take
the promicin shot.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.080
those shots are killing people.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.960
i know all about the risks.

15:20.960 --> 15:21.960
i think they're worth it.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.240
they're not worth it,

15:23.240 --> 15:26.040
not when you have as much
to live for as you do.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.280
think about the odds, okay?

15:28.280 --> 15:30.120
there's a 50-50 chance

15:30.120 --> 15:31.720
that you would be
committing suicide.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.560
what are you really
afraid of, shawn?

15:34.560 --> 15:36.480
me dying,
or me getting an ability?

15:36.480 --> 15:37.920
because that would put us
on equal footing,

15:37.920 --> 15:38.520
and we can't have that.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.120
this isn't about you and me.
it's always about you and me!

15:42.120 --> 15:43.440
i mean, i thought
you'd be excited about this.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.520
i thought you'd be
supportive,

15:44.520 --> 15:45.560
btu i guess i was wrong.

15:45.560 --> 15:46.960
danny, please, listen--

15:46.960 --> 15:49.240
no, shawn, i'm glad that you're back with us,
i really am.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.680
but i'm not asking
for your permission.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.040
i mean, the stuff is out there,
and i'll get it,

15:52.280 --> 15:53.440
with or without your help

15:59.880 --> 16:01.240
i have to clean.
i haven't finished.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.600
i haven't finished.
i've got to clean.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.680
the germs are everywhere.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.120
just stop--
don't touch me.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.320
what happened
to his hands?

16:08.320 --> 16:09.440
paramedics found him

16:09.440 --> 16:10.720
scrubbing them
with a brillo pad.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.960
well, i just checked
his apartment.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.400
according to his records,

16:13.400 --> 16:14.840
this guy, haugen,
banks at washington prime

16:14.840 --> 16:16.360
and not columbia fidelity.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.360
so this is a separate incident
from the one at the bank.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.480
or maybe he knows
the victim

16:19.480 --> 16:21.240
in some other way.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.320
well, let's canvass
the building,

16:22.320 --> 16:24.240
talk to the tenants,
see if we can find a link.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.200
right.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.280
can i help you?

16:48.280 --> 16:49.720
so is this about ray?

16:49.720 --> 16:51.520
i saw him being loaded
into an ambulance.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.800
did you see him
before that?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.400
maybe earlier
this morning?

16:55.400 --> 16:56.840
no, but my husband did.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.760
our bathroom faucet's
been leaking for a week,

16:58.760 --> 17:00.160
and ray still hasn't
gotten around

17:00.160 --> 17:01.880
to fixing it.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.320
what time do you expect
your husband home?

17:03.320 --> 17:05.119
why?

17:05.119 --> 17:06.240
it's not like
they had a fight

17:06.240 --> 17:08.000
or anything.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.319
you know, when i was a kid,
i used to play with trains, too.

17:13.319 --> 17:14.720
just like--

17:14.720 --> 17:15.760
don't worry,
it's not your fault.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.280
brandon's autistic.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.359
he likes things
in a certain order.

17:22.359 --> 17:23.400
there we go. see?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.280
excuse me?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.320
is this your husband?

17:36.320 --> 17:37.920
yeah, that's ryan.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.320
why?

17:41.160 --> 17:43.240
isn't he one of the guys
from the atm line?

17:43.240 --> 17:45.800
i think we found our link.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.880
you want me
to talk to danny?

17:47.880 --> 17:49.840
you might be able
to talk some sense into him,

17:49.840 --> 17:51.080
convince him that he'd be,

17:51.080 --> 17:52.600
you know,
crazy to take that shot.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.560
i can't do that, shawn.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.400
if danny wants to take promicin,
i say, give it to him.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.600
kyle, this isn't just
some guy on the street

18:00.600 --> 18:01.560
with nothing
to lose.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.560
this is
my little brother.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.280
that shot could kill him.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.000
it didn't kill me.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.000
you took promicin?

18:12.400 --> 18:14.640
kyle, you took
promicin?

18:14.640 --> 18:17.360
three months ago.

18:17.360 --> 18:21.840
my hand was shaking so bad,
i could barely hold the syringe,

18:21.840 --> 18:25.280
but i survived.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.680
i didn't get an ability, but...

18:27.680 --> 18:29.120
i survived.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.840
since when do you care about
getting an ability so much?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.200
it's not just about
getting an ability, shawn.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.360
it's about making a difference.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.240
what collier's trying to do,
change this world, man?

18:37.240 --> 18:38.200
that's important.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.520
i wanted to be
a part of that,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.040
and i bet danny feels
the same way.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.240
no, kyle,
i don't think

18:44.240 --> 18:45.440
that danny cares
about jordan

18:45.440 --> 18:46.880
or changing the world.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.320
he's trying to prove
something to himself,

18:48.320 --> 18:49.440
or to me.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.680
it's a jealousy thing.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.320
that may be true,

18:52.320 --> 18:53.560
but the reason doesn't matter,
okay?

18:53.560 --> 18:54.600
if danny wants to take the shot,

18:54.600 --> 18:55.680
i don't think you
or anyone else

18:55.680 --> 18:56.760
has a right
to stop him.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.960
i'm sorry, tom,

19:00.960 --> 19:02.560
but ryan powell
tested negative for promicin.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.280
i had no choice
but to release him.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.560
same with
the atm customers

19:05.560 --> 19:06.680
and the bank
employees,

19:06.680 --> 19:07.760
they all
came back clean.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.040
no, that can't be right.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.200
powell's our only link
between the bank victims

19:10.200 --> 19:11.480
and ray haugen.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.440
you're telling me
that's just a coincidence?

19:12.440 --> 19:13.400
i don't know what it is.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.600
but ryan powell
didn't take promicin,

19:14.600 --> 19:15.800
he doesn't have
an ability,

19:15.800 --> 19:17.600
and he's not the guy
we're looking for.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.440
did you lose a filling
or something?

19:19.440 --> 19:21.280
ah...

19:26.200 --> 19:27.480
my tooth...

19:27.480 --> 19:28.760
it just fell out.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.960
jed, there's nothing
in your hand.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.360
hey, hey, hey...

19:34.360 --> 19:35.360
just calm down,
calm down.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.000
get somebody in here.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.240
this is meghan doyle.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.440
i need a medical team up here
right away.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.960
hey, jed, jed...

19:46.960 --> 19:48.440
hey, look at me,
look at me.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.160
i'm coming apart!

19:56.240 --> 19:57.280
it's okay...
don't let me die!

19:57.280 --> 19:58.840
somebody, get in here!

20:00.520 --> 20:01.760
look at me,
look at me...

20:05.720 --> 20:07.480
aren't you going
to say hello?

20:08.880 --> 20:10.720
you headed some place
in particular,

20:10.720 --> 20:13.080
or were you combing the city
hoping to find me.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.200
where have you been, huh?

20:16.200 --> 20:17.320
that art school
you said you were going to?

20:17.320 --> 20:18.360
i went there.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.800
they never even
heard of you.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.520
does it really matter
where i go to school?

20:21.520 --> 20:23.480
the important thing is
shawn's okay.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.920
he is, isn't he?

20:26.640 --> 20:29.280
how'd you know
the promicin would wake him up?

20:29.280 --> 20:30.080
who are you?

20:30.080 --> 20:32.160
come on, i think
you know that.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.320
what's that
supposed to mean?

20:34.320 --> 20:36.840
huh, what's that
supposed to mean?

20:36.840 --> 20:38.400
you said
you wanted answers.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.360
i'll take you
to them.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.920
are you coming or not?

20:49.720 --> 20:52.160
he looks fine to me.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.560
oh, trust me,
he's not.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.040
well, i don't
understand.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.240
i mean, you've been
together all day.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.520
yeah, pretty much.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.760
the bank,
the apartment building.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.160
we had contact with
all the same people.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.240
well, i mean, that's
a bit odd, isn't it?

21:03.240 --> 21:06.120
that he would be affected
and not you?

21:08.240 --> 21:09.720
it was that kid.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.000
it was that kid, diana.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.400
it has to be.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.840
when we were at
ryan powell's apartment,

21:17.840 --> 21:19.240
and i was
interviewing the wife.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.120
garrity spoke to the son.
he's autistic.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.440
he started screaming at garrity
and rocking back and forth.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.520
that's when it happened.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.080
it has to be.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.560
jess, come on. come on.
come on, please!

21:29.560 --> 21:31.000
let's get out of here.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.720
just throw some stuff together
and let's go.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.880
brandon,
what do you say, buddy?

21:33.880 --> 21:35.040
you want to go
on a little road trip?

21:35.040 --> 21:36.160
we're not going
anywhere.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.080
just tell me
why ntac is after you.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.440
it's not me they're after.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.640
it's brandon.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.800
why?

21:45.800 --> 21:48.000
brandon hasn't done
anything wrong.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.200
has he?

21:50.200 --> 21:52.000
i-i swear,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.200
i was only
trying to help him.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.040
okay, jess, just i...

21:56.040 --> 21:58.160
i did... something.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.800
i couldn't tell you.
i'm sorry.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.760
you did something?

22:02.760 --> 22:04.080
oh...

22:04.080 --> 22:05.760
you gave him one of those shots.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.680
you gave him
one of those shots?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.840
you bastard!

22:09.840 --> 22:12.960
what did you do
to my son?

22:26.120 --> 22:27.400
you're too late.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.280
they're gone.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.880
where are they, mr. powell?

22:32.880 --> 22:35.080
i don't know where jess is taking him.
she didn't tell me.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.480
we need to find your son
before he hurts anyone else.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.600
where are they?

22:37.600 --> 22:40.600
do you know what it's like
to have a...

22:40.600 --> 22:41.720
a son who won't...

22:41.720 --> 22:43.160
hug you, or smile at you?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.120
won't even...

22:44.120 --> 22:46.040
won't even look you in the eye?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.200
clear.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.840
is that why you gave him
promicin?

22:52.840 --> 22:55.480
i thought if brandon
got an ability,

22:55.480 --> 22:56.840
it would make him better,

22:56.840 --> 22:59.080
at least help him
to communicate.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.280
i-i don't
even know

23:00.280 --> 23:02.600
what my own son is-
is thinking,

23:02.600 --> 23:04.800
or feeling, you know?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.240
that's no way for a kid to live.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.360
all he does is...

23:08.360 --> 23:10.160
play with that goddamn train.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.280
mr. powell, we're going
to need you to think.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.200
where would your wife
have taken brandon?

23:14.200 --> 23:16.880
look, i didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.160
please...

23:18.160 --> 23:19.280
please, none of this
is his fault.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.400
he doesn't know.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.480
he has no idea what he's doing.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.360
if anybody's to blame, it's me.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.360
so your wife...

23:25.360 --> 23:26.480
she didn't know
you injected him?

23:32.200 --> 23:33.480
are you kidding me?

23:33.480 --> 23:34.480
50-50?

23:34.480 --> 23:36.200
she'd never agree to that.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.600
but you were willing
to take the risk.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.520
i see other parents...

23:43.520 --> 23:45.800
with their own kids,

23:45.800 --> 23:49.880
and the warmth,
and the joking around...

23:51.880 --> 23:53.520
i wanted some of that.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.200
i...

23:57.200 --> 23:59.120
i wasn't trying to kill brandon.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.240
she has to believe that.
i just...

24:01.240 --> 24:03.120
i just...

24:03.120 --> 24:04.560
i just wanted him
to have the chance at a...

24:04.560 --> 24:07.240
at a normal life.

24:38.800 --> 24:42.400
thank you for your cooperation,
ms. tyler.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.960
we'll be in contact shortly.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.200
get me a copy of the lab report.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.360
is that all?
we're done?

24:47.360 --> 24:49.200
did i pass?

24:52.320 --> 24:53.800
hello!

24:56.240 --> 24:58.040
well, you wanted
answers, kyle.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.520
you'll find them
in there.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.400
are you
coming with me?

25:05.400 --> 25:07.680
it's better
if i don't.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.440
what do you know
about white light?

25:21.440 --> 25:23.520
not too much,
actually.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.880
my great-grandfather
founded the group

25:25.880 --> 25:28.160
back in 1918.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.120
even at its height,

25:30.120 --> 25:34.480
the membership never exceeded
a few dozen people.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.280
the whole thing
only lasted

25:36.280 --> 25:37.520
a few years.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.040
they all died.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.400
burned to death in a fire.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.360
what did
these people believe?

25:44.360 --> 25:47.160
they believed
that a messiah

25:47.160 --> 25:49.280
would return
from the dead

25:49.280 --> 25:50.920
and lead the world
to salvation.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.560
not the proudest branch
on my family tree.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.920
but people are interested
in this stuff,

25:57.920 --> 25:59.720
so i keep it around.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.240
this was
their scripture,

26:02.240 --> 26:06.760
and this was the messiah
they were waiting for.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.920
yeah, that looks like
jordan collier.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.840
you're not the first person
to mention a resemblance.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.120
i don't know, maybe.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.800
feel free to...
thumb through the book

26:25.800 --> 26:27.200
if you'd like.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.240
a few of the chapters
are too charred to read,

26:30.240 --> 26:32.120
and one of them
is written in a...

26:32.120 --> 26:35.160
oh, i don't know,
a-a code or something,

26:35.160 --> 26:37.920
but there's enough for you
to get the gist.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.080
that's great, thank you.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.040
oh, brandon...

26:50.040 --> 26:52.320
please, not now, okay?

26:52.320 --> 26:54.080
um... are you hungry, honey?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.120
do you want a snack?

26:59.120 --> 27:01.040
no? okay.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
uh, how about your train?

27:02.040 --> 27:03.080
you want your train?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.440
i got your train right here,
sweetie, okay?

28:12.480 --> 28:13.440
do you see them?

28:13.440 --> 28:14.440
do you see them?
are they gone?

28:14.440 --> 28:15.440
is what gone?

28:15.440 --> 28:16.680
the snakes!

28:16.680 --> 28:18.040
they're here somewhere,
i know it.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.040
don't let them
get me, please!

28:19.040 --> 28:20.640
mrs. powell,
just calm down.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.560
everything will be okay,
i promise.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.720
did you see the direction

28:23.720 --> 28:25.440
your son was headed,
mrs. powell?

28:25.440 --> 28:26.880
no, i must've blacked out.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.640
when i opened my eyes,
he was gone.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.120
you have to find him.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.960
please, you have to find him.
he's out there all alone.

28:31.960 --> 28:32.920
he must be so scared!

28:32.920 --> 28:34.640
all right,
mrs. powell.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.720
if you were brandon,
if you were your son,

28:36.720 --> 28:37.840
where would you go?

28:43.640 --> 28:45.480
hey, diana!

29:07.080 --> 29:08.440
hey, kid,
shouldn't you be at home?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.880
hey...

29:10.880 --> 29:12.360
where are
your parents, bud?

29:12.360 --> 29:13.520
do they know
you're out here?

29:13.520 --> 29:15.280
hey...

29:16.720 --> 29:17.840
whoa, buddy.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.040
take it easy.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.800
take it easy!

29:24.000 --> 29:25.720
so, what did you think?

29:25.720 --> 29:27.160
pretty interesting
reading, huh?

29:27.160 --> 29:28.600
that's why
you brought me here,

29:28.600 --> 29:29.560
to read that book?

29:29.560 --> 29:32.080
a messiah
who rises from the dead,

29:32.080 --> 29:33.520
who passes out
a sacred elixir

29:33.520 --> 29:34.400
that changes the world?

29:34.400 --> 29:36.040
i know, that sounds
just like jordan collier,

29:36.040 --> 29:37.960
and that healer who lays
his hands upon the sick?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.240
i'm guessing
that's supposed to be shawn.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.680
and don't forget
about the shaman,

29:40.680 --> 29:41.960
whose visions
guide the messiah

29:41.960 --> 29:43.200
down the path to enlightenment.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.160
want to take a stab
at who that is?

29:46.440 --> 29:48.280
the shaman is you, kyle.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.080
me...

29:52.080 --> 29:53.320
i know it might sound
a little intimidating--

29:53.320 --> 29:54.480
intimidating?
try insane.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.120
all right,
you know, i admit

29:56.120 --> 29:58.040
that book got few things right,
about jordan, about promicin,

29:58.040 --> 29:59.320
but the rest of it's
kind of vague,

29:59.320 --> 30:00.520
and there's that whole
chapter that's in code.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.160
and what about
the part that says,

30:02.160 --> 30:03.840
the messiah will show us
the face of god?

30:03.840 --> 30:05.680
"and all will know
his face,

30:05.680 --> 30:07.160
"and he will
smile down upon us

30:07.160 --> 30:08.480
"and walk among us,

30:08.480 --> 30:10.640
and the earth and heaven
will be as one--"

30:10.640 --> 30:12.040
and collier's
going to make that happen, huh?

30:12.040 --> 30:14.200
with your help.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.560
it's a prophecy, kyle.

30:15.560 --> 30:16.720
i don't
believe that.

30:16.720 --> 30:20.040
look, you helped me
wake up my cousin.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.880
for that, i am grateful,
but this is over.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.840
no, kyle,
it's just beginning.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.120
look, this cult,
"white light?"

30:25.120 --> 30:26.880
it's still around, isn't it?
and you're one of them.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.880
you're trying to use jordan
to start some kind of

30:28.880 --> 30:29.840
crazy religious revival?

30:29.840 --> 30:30.840
i won't be a part of that.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.400
you already are--

30:32.400 --> 30:33.680
i don't want to
hear anymore.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.000
just stay the hell away from me.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.440
what changed your mind?

30:53.440 --> 30:55.840
nothing changed my mind.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.320
i don't agree
with taking promicin.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.400
i think it's a mistake.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.560
50-50,
those are lousy odds.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.720
but you were right
about one thing,

31:09.720 --> 31:10.800
it's your decision,

31:10.800 --> 31:12.240
and i don't want you
getting arrested

31:12.240 --> 31:14.680
trying to find
the stuff yourself.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.920
they're throwing people
in jail, danny, no trial.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.680
i don't get it.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.720
you were with collier
from the beginning.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.920
he put this out there.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.120
i mean,
if you don't agree with it,

31:26.120 --> 31:27.560
where does that leave
you and him?

31:29.320 --> 31:31.040
i wish jordan
had buried that stuff somewhere.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.920
these abilities cause
as many problems

31:33.920 --> 31:37.040
as they solve.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.280
just do me a favor, okay,
and just hold off for a while.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.160
maybe if you read the paper
for the next few weeks,

31:49.160 --> 31:50.560
law school won't seem so bad.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.840
yeah, okay.

31:52.840 --> 31:53.880
i can do that.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.000
please, don't look at me!

32:08.000 --> 32:10.560
i don't like people
looking at me!

32:10.560 --> 32:12.160
okay, i'm going to
call this in.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.200
don't worry, sir,

32:13.200 --> 32:14.200
we're going to
get you help.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.400
are there going to be
people there?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.120
i don't like
people seeing me.

32:17.120 --> 32:21.080
at least brandon's
giving us a trail to follow.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.000
i hate that
we have to sedate him,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.960
but i don't know how else
to get him back into ntac.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.880
i'm starting to remember
why i gave this job up at the first place.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.440
diana, i wish
there was another way,

32:51.440 --> 32:53.600
but his ability's
too much of a threat.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.240
if only jordan collier

32:55.240 --> 32:56.960
wasn't the most wanted man
in the world.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.040
he could take his ability away,
couldn't he?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.240
we can't cure him
of his ability,

33:08.240 --> 33:10.720
but maybe there's a way
we can help him control it.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.640
it's okay, brandon.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.240
everything's going to be okay.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.440
can we just do this, please?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.080
he's been given
the inhibitor,

33:47.080 --> 33:48.520
so, hopefully, there won't
be any kind of danger,

33:48.520 --> 33:50.200
but there's still
some risk involved.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.360
so if you want to
back out,

33:51.360 --> 33:53.600
we'd understand.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.520
it's not that,

33:55.520 --> 33:58.160
it's just...

33:58.160 --> 34:01.560
i haven't healed anyone
in months,

34:01.560 --> 34:03.880
and autism is developmental.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.520
i haven't had a lot of success
with that in the past.

34:06.520 --> 34:10.560
but you will try?

34:10.560 --> 34:13.679
yeah.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.120
shawn...

34:53.360 --> 34:54.360
is-is that it?

34:54.360 --> 34:57.120
did it work?

34:57.120 --> 34:58.080
brandon?

34:58.080 --> 34:59.640
brandon, look at me.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.040
da...

35:05.040 --> 35:06.480
da...

35:06.480 --> 35:07.760
da...

35:07.760 --> 35:08.800
dad.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.520
that's right.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.200
i'm your dad.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.240
that...

35:17.240 --> 35:20.320
that was incredible.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.400
i forgot how much i liked this.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.400
look at you.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.680
i can give you
a few minutes, mr. powell,

35:38.680 --> 35:39.720
but then i'm afraid

35:39.720 --> 35:41.480
you're going to have to
come with us.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.480
my son has been...

35:44.480 --> 35:46.480
in a prison his entire life.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.400
i'm happy
to trade places with him.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.880
your test results came back.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.240
whatever you were given
to take away your abilities,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.240
it induced a permanent allergy
to promicin.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.000
if you were
to take the shot,

36:18.000 --> 36:19.400
it would be fatal.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.720
you will never get
your abilities back, miss tyler.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.920
does that mean
i'm getting out of here?

36:26.920 --> 36:30.240
the ??? will take in two weeks

36:53.640 --> 36:55.320
this how you spend
your saturdays?

36:57.960 --> 36:59.240
most nights, too.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.720
i thought you might want to hear
some good news.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.680
dr. clayton says
the people brandon affected,

37:03.680 --> 37:05.720
they're beginning to show
signs of improvement.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.960
you think
putting him on the inhibitor

37:06.960 --> 37:08.040
had something to do with it?

37:08.040 --> 37:09.560
as soon as we muted his ability,

37:09.560 --> 37:11.800
their symptoms
began to dissipate,

37:11.800 --> 37:15.160
which means garrity should be
back in rotation soon.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.080
unless you'd prefer
to stick with skouris.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.000
look, nothing against jed,

37:21.000 --> 37:22.520
but if diana's
going to be around,

37:22.520 --> 37:23.560
she's my partner.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.800
okay.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.880
so what happens to brandon now?

37:27.880 --> 37:29.520
well, as long as
his mother brings him in

37:29.520 --> 37:31.040
for weekly injections
of the inhibitor,

37:31.040 --> 37:32.160
he should be able
to live

37:32.160 --> 37:34.240
a fairly normal life--

37:34.240 --> 37:36.560
more normal than he has
up to now anyway.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.800
hmm...

37:37.800 --> 37:38.960
that was
an amazing thing

37:38.960 --> 37:40.000
your nephew did.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.320
yeah, these abilities
people get,

37:42.320 --> 37:43.560
they come in handy sometimes.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.600
it's worth remembering.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.400
so is it really her?

37:53.400 --> 37:55.760
alana?

37:55.760 --> 37:58.240
i keep trying
to convince myself it's not,

37:58.240 --> 38:00.360
but, yeah, it's her,

38:00.360 --> 38:02.120
and all i can think about
is how do i get her back.

38:02.120 --> 38:06.400
maybe all you can do is...

38:06.400 --> 38:07.840
let her go.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.520
i really need
to take this.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.480
yeah.

38:27.160 --> 38:28.240
dr. sawyer?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.160
the news isn't good.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.360
your father's had a relapse.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.520
pneumonia?

38:34.520 --> 38:36.360
his breathing's been
severely compromised.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.280
he's beaten this before.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.200
i know,
but i think it's time

38:40.200 --> 38:41.280
we start
preparing ourselves

38:41.280 --> 38:43.360
for the inevitable.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.760
i'm sorry.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.440
how did you get in here?

39:13.440 --> 39:14.560
it was easy.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.560
where you go, i go.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.920
you're stalking me now,
is that it?

39:17.920 --> 39:19.560
come on, kyle, think.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.760
i don't go
to the art institute.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.200
there's no record
of me anywhere.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.280
i show up wherever i want to.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.320
what does that tell you?

39:26.320 --> 39:27.360
hey, kyle...

39:27.360 --> 39:29.640
you up for
some dinner?

39:29.640 --> 39:30.840
hey...

39:30.840 --> 39:32.040
i don't feel like
eating alone tonight.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.840
dad, i want you to meet cassie.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.960
okay.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.120
who's cassie?

39:41.640 --> 39:44.760
is she someone you met at work?

39:45.520 --> 39:46.800
??

39:47.760 --> 39:49.360
???

39:49.960 --> 39:52.640
!!

39:54.280 --> 39:55.880
