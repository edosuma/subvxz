Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:04.171 --> 00:07.549
- Your nephew's coming to visit.
- No, he's coming to stay.

00:07.633 --> 00:08.926
Luke is a great guy.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.802
He really wants to take care of you.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.804
You're incredibly lucky to have him.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.765
What? Are you sleeping with him
or something?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.058
Hey.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.142
I'm Rory.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.352
Yeah, I figured.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.438
- How long is he staying?
- I don't know. Indefinitely.

00:21.522 --> 00:25.108
You don't know anything about me,
or my life, or my mom, or Luke.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.361
So why don't you Dr. Laura someone else?

00:27.444 --> 00:29.530
I'm going inside. Stay out of my fridge.

00:29.613 --> 00:33.116
I'm sorry. That kid is way more
screwed up than you think he is.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.661
- Why are you only nice to me?
- Excuse me?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.287
I am concerned about Jess.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.914
- You shouldn't be.
- But I am.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.457
What do you want from me?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.376
You bring me here,
you put me in a school...

00:42.459 --> 00:45.170
that says the Pledge of Allegiance
in six languages...

00:45.212 --> 00:47.047
two of which I've never heard of!

00:47.130 --> 00:50.008
You take me away from my home,
my friends, and now you want...

00:50.050 --> 00:51.760
- what from me?
- I'm trying to help you!

00:51.844 --> 00:52.886
Stop trying!

00:52.970 --> 00:55.013
I read a lot. Do you read?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.181
Not much.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.224
I'm worried about Rory.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.101
She shouldn't be hanging out
with this guy.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.812
- You've read this before.
- About 40 times.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.939
I thought you said you didn't read much.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.357
What is much?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.693
What was I thinking?
Why did I say yes to this?

01:07.734 --> 01:11.196
You saw a kid in need of help
and you thought you'd throw him a line.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.699
But me? Raising a kid?
I don't even like kids.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.783
Why'd you call?

01:14.867 --> 01:17.786
- I wanted to...
- I'm glad you called.

01:17.870 --> 01:18.996
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.875
He's gonna get her into trouble.
I can feel it. I just know it.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.969
- It still hurts!
- Do you need stitches?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.637
- Probably.
- We should go to a doctor.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.599
No doctors. You go into a hospital,
you don't come out again!

01:38.682 --> 01:40.184
Well said, Ida Morgenstern.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.768
I'm starving. I need pancakes.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.938
Can I just ask what on earth
you thought you were doing?

01:45.022 --> 01:47.232
I thought I was being
a self-sufficient woman.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.734
You hate ladders and heights.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.444
We needed our rain gutters cleaned.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.029
Hire somebody.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.739
Aren't we suddenly a Rockefeller.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.616
It's better than you killing yourself.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.202
I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic.
It's what I do.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.078
- No more ladders.
- I promise.

02:00.871 --> 02:01.872
I think I have gangrene.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.624
- You do not.
- And vertigo.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.126
- Oh, boy.
- One leg feels shorter than the other.

02:06.210 --> 02:10.088
This is gonna be the Vanity Fair
paper-cut incident all over again, isn't it?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.548
Leave your bandage alone.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.176
It's turning purple,
but a really glowy purple! Look!

02:14.259 --> 02:15.719
No, thanks.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.681
Maybe our rain gutters are radioactive
or made out of some kind of alien metal...

02:19.765 --> 02:23.435
so when I cut my hand, I got infected
with an extraterrestrial substance...

02:23.519 --> 02:26.104
which is altering my internal makeup.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.440
- Maybe I'll turn into a superhero!
- Maybe.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.902
Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up
and suddenly be able to shower really fast.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.530
We'll go pick out your cape after breakfast.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.173
God, I'm starving.
Must be from the loss of blood.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.507
Yes, that must be it.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.843
I'm getting pancakes
with a side of pancakes.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.179
- Where's Luke?
- I don't know. Storage room?

03:41.930 --> 03:43.765
- Caesar's cooking.
- Why is Caesar cooking?

03:43.849 --> 03:45.684
- I don't know.
- That's bad.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.394
- His pancakes stink.
- They do stink.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.605
What do we do, resort to donuts?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.023
Wait here.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.866
Luke, are you in there?

04:02.034 --> 04:03.744
Luke, are you okay?

04:04.203 --> 04:05.579
Stupid lamp!

04:06.038 --> 04:09.208
Are you being attacked
by your possessions again?

04:09.917 --> 04:10.918
What're you doing?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.669
I'm looking for my supply ledger.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.296
- Is it going well?
- It's going fine.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.964
You have a sock on your shoulder.
Is it helping you look?

04:17.048 --> 04:19.510
- What're you doing up here?
- Rory and I are starving.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.012
We need you to cook us breakfast.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.973
- Oh, my God.
- Caesar can make you breakfast.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.684
- What happened to this place?
- Nothing.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.479
This is what I pictured
the inside of my head to look like.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.732
- Find a brown leather ledger.
- I've never seen so much stuff.

04:33.815 --> 04:37.110
- It looks like a white-trash Hearst Castle.
- I'll find it myself.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.237
Where'd all this come from?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.739
Jess. Liz shipped
the rest of his stuff last week.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.908
- He finally unpacked.
- He did a very nice job.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.744
It's crazy now,
but I just have to get it all organized...

04:45.786 --> 04:48.413
figure out where to put everything,
buy another dresser...

04:48.497 --> 04:50.165
a portable wardrobe, some storage bins.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.416
Gasoline, box of matches.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.418
Did I mention
Caesar can cook you breakfast?

04:53.502 --> 04:56.338
He doesn't make the good, fluffy pancakes
like you do.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.549
- Then order eggs.
- No.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.262
- See, I had a near-death experience today.
- Really?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.431
I almost fell off the roof
trying to clean the rain gutters...

05:06.515 --> 05:09.017
so I have to have pancakes. Please?

05:09.101 --> 05:12.020
I'll help you shower
when I become a superhero.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.064
You've been in there for two hours.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.608
My hair just ain't bouncing
and behaving today.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.944
There are other people living here, too.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.280
Learn something new every day.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.117
His people skills are really improving.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.452
Go downstairs.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.829
- How long is that?
- I don't know.

05:28.912 --> 05:29.997
- An estimate.
- I don't know.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.915
Ballpark figure. Off the top of your head.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.501
- Will you...
- Did I mention I almost fell off my roof?

05:34.585 --> 05:37.171
I'd lie down if I could find the bed.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.048
- Is this what you're looking for?
- Great. Thank you.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.592
Not unless you make the pancakes.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.469
- Give me the book.
- Give me the pancake!

05:44.511 --> 05:46.597
- Come on.
- Thank you.

05:47.723 --> 05:51.435
You sure you weren't almost pushed off
the roof of your house today?

05:54.188 --> 05:56.106
I think I'm finally ready to get a tattoo.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.149
- Please.
- I am.

05:57.232 --> 06:00.485
- You've been saying that for five years.
- But I mean it this time.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.904
Fine. What are you getting?

06:01.987 --> 06:04.114
- Mel Brooks.
- Why?

06:04.198 --> 06:05.490
What do you mean 'why'?

06:05.574 --> 06:08.660
The 2000 Year Old Man,
Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie.

06:08.744 --> 06:11.538
Hasn't Mel has earned the right
to have his face on my butt?

06:11.622 --> 06:12.831
I am so sorry, Mel.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.042
He'll love it. Trust me.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.003
Rocky road hot fudge sundaes
and two cans of whipped cream?

06:18.086 --> 06:20.255
Trying to give Mel
a bigger canvas to work with?

06:20.339 --> 06:23.175
The man's a legend. He deserves the best.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.511
- What?
- Luke.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.597
- What's he doing?
- I'm not sure.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.725
Get the ice cream and make sure
they give us maraschino cherries.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.310
- Okay.
- Thanks.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.117
- What are you doing?
- Rory and I just hit the video store.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.912
We're going home to eat something
you wouldn't approve of.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.372
Sounds good.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.874
What are you doing?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.334
Watching TV.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.547
That's cute. Is it the first time
it's been away from its mother?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.423
It's a very good TV.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.385
Black and white,
coat-hanger antenna, really bad reception.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.803
It's fine.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.721
Don't you have a fully grown TV upstairs?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.598
Yeah, well, Jess is upstairs.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.684
- So?
- So when Jess is upstairs...

07:13.767 --> 07:16.603
that means the stereo's blaring
and the place is a mess.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.313
I just needed a little privacy.

07:18.397 --> 07:22.109
So you came downstairs
to sit on an uncomfortable chair...

07:22.192 --> 07:24.695
in an empty diner
that smells like onion rings.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.779
Calgon take me away!

07:25.863 --> 07:28.699
It was very peaceful
until two minutes ago.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.160
Did you ever think that maybe
you should get a bigger apartment?

07:32.244 --> 07:33.537
I don't need one.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.581
That place upstairs
was your father's office.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.292
You made it an apartment.
It wasn't meant to be lived in.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.377
- It's fine.
- It's too small for two people.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.172
It's too small for one person
if they have any kind of life.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.798
We'll make do. We just need to...

07:44.882 --> 07:48.177
No, you don't need to organize.
You need to move.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.761
I like my apartment.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.389
It's not just your apartment.
Jess lives there also.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.473
Jess is fine.

07:53.557 --> 07:57.477
He could be pinned under a box for a year
in that place and you wouldn't know it...

07:57.561 --> 08:00.689
until the neighbors started to complain
about the smell.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.567
Rory. Perfect. Get her out of here.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.778
Okay, fine. I'm leaving.
Think about what I said.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.407
You ever hire anybody
to do that work for you?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.491
- What?
- The rain gutters?

08:11.575 --> 08:14.203
No, not yet. Are you offering?

08:14.286 --> 08:16.455
Actually, I was thinking about Jess.

08:17.122 --> 08:20.918
He's always looking for a little extra cash.
He doesn't make that much here...

08:20.959 --> 08:23.629
and I hate to think of where else
he might try to get it.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.548
You don't have to pay him the same
as you would someone else.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.592
You save a little. He keeps busy.

08:28.675 --> 08:33.138
Yeah, well, maybe. I actually have to check
with a couple of people...

08:33.222 --> 08:36.475
that I'm supposed to hear from,
but if they can't do it, then, sure.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.808
Great. Just let me know.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.145
I will. Bye.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.445
Who are all these people you asked
to clean out our gutters?

08:48.529 --> 08:49.571
- You know.
- I do?

08:49.655 --> 08:50.989
- Sure.
- Remind me?

08:51.073 --> 08:52.824
Okay, there's Cid.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.201
Cid, right.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.370
And then there's Lou.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.038
Yeah, a good man, Lou.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.124
And also Moose, if Doris will let him
out of the house again...

09:01.208 --> 09:03.710
after that incident
at Chicky's bachelor party.

09:03.794 --> 09:07.172
I thought you said
you were gonna give Jess a chance.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.674
I am.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.300
Then why won't you hire him?

09:10.384 --> 09:13.971
I'm just... not very comfortable
with him, Rory.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.347
Try and get comfortable.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.140
- I don't know if I can.
- But you said...

09:17.182 --> 09:19.601
I know what I said, but I can't help it.

09:19.852 --> 09:23.021
- How many times can I tell you...
- That I don't know the real Jess?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.483
Fine, I don't know him,
but I'm not too fond of his stand-in.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.694
People are different
once you get to know them.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.530
- You weren't too fond of Luke at first.
- That's not true.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.740
You called him Duke for two years
to make him mad.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.660
- And let me tell you, it worked.
- But then you guys talked...

09:36.743 --> 09:39.788
and eventually, time went by.
Now you love him.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.584
I'm just asking you
to give Jess that same chance.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.586
Rory, you like him.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.088
- I don't have to like him.
- Please.

09:50.841 --> 09:54.553
- Can I at least call him Tess for a while?
- You'll give him the job?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.305
I'll give him the job.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.473
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.230
- Tell me something.
- What?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.025
Why is it so important to you
that I like him?

10:09.651 --> 10:12.613
I just think that he's Luke's nephew,
and we like Luke...

10:12.696 --> 10:16.742
we eat at Luke's every day, we see Jess
when we eat there every day...

10:16.950 --> 10:20.037
and that it just might make things nicer
if you liked him.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.207
And that's the only reason?
It's all about Luke and the diner.

10:23.248 --> 10:27.794
It's got nothing to do with you.
So you and Jess aren't... friends?

10:28.170 --> 10:29.922
Yeah, we're friends.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.216
I mean...

10:32.257 --> 10:34.718
we're not good friends, but we're friends.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.846
We're friendly.
But that doesn't mean that...

10:37.930 --> 10:41.934
we're friends in the traditional Webster's
Dictionary definition of 'friends. '

10:42.017 --> 10:43.018
Right.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.937
- 'Friendish' might be a better term.
- Okay.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.647
'Friendish. ' Got it.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.982
And walk. And pump your arms and walk.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.194
And shoulders back, tuchis in.
Think about that double chin.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.614
And walk. And tummies tight and walk.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.032
Match me, sweetheart.

11:17.678 --> 11:21.390
How can anyone sleep through that?
It's like the Huns are attacking.

11:21.473 --> 11:25.936
You're oblivious. That's why you lie there
while the rest of the world is going deaf.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.398
Great.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.484
Damn it.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.535
- What the hell!
- I can't stand it! I'm going crazy!

11:41.618 --> 11:43.996
This place is awful!
I can't live like this anymore.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.832
- Just relax.
- I can't relax. I can't sleep.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.377
I'm having nightmares about being
chased around by boxes with arms...

11:50.460 --> 11:53.172
and they tackle me and pile clothing
on top of my face...

11:53.213 --> 11:55.340
and secure it around my head
with packing tape...

11:55.424 --> 11:58.468
and I'm lying there choking
as you sit in the corner laughing...

11:58.510 --> 12:01.388
- gelling your hair with a switchblade!
- Should I be putting...

12:01.471 --> 12:03.640
- a tongue depressor in your mouth?
- We're moving.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.725
- What?
- Tomorrow.

12:04.808 --> 12:07.477
- What are you talking...
- I'm talking about us going out...

12:07.519 --> 12:09.605
- and finding a new place to live.
- But I...

12:09.688 --> 12:12.816
No buts! 10:00 a. m. Tomorrow,
I want you up, washed, moussed...

12:12.900 --> 12:15.277
and ready to leave. End of story.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.237
Now go back to bed.

12:18.363 --> 12:19.531
What?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.783
I need the music on to sleep.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.342
- Forget it.
- What was wrong with it?

12:38.383 --> 12:39.843
- It was pink.
- We can paint it.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.221
- You mean I can paint it.
- We can paint it together.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.223
Then we can hold hands
and skip afterwards.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.350
- Fine. Which one do you like?
- The one before.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.726
- The one with two fridges.
- No.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.520
The one before had two fridges.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.355
No, it was the one with the cat.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.066
- I hate cats.
- I don't think the cat came with the place.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.485
It had carpeting,
so it'll always smell like a cat.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.028
- Clean the carpet.
- Paint the pink.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.489
- Fine, the one next to the bank.
- Too many windows.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.824
- What?
- Six windows, all on one side...

13:02.908 --> 13:04.868
3:00 p. m., we're sitting in an oven.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.663
- So we get curtains.
- You'll have to help me put them up.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.832
Then we can hold hands
and skip afterwards.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.542
- Stop saying that.
- I don't care.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.211
- Pick whichever one you want.
- I'm not picking by myself.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.922
- You want to move.
- So you like living the way we do.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.049
- Fine by me.
- No space, no privacy?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.217
I got plenty of privacy.

13:20.259 --> 13:22.970
Because I'm downstairs in the dark
watching a two-inch TV.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.681
- You have a problem, you make the choice.
- Jess, come on.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.724
- I have to go.
- We got three more places.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.477
I'm supposed to be at Lorelai's
in 20 minutes, remember?

13:30.561 --> 13:32.479
- Yeah.
- If you want me to bail on her, fine.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.148
- No, you go. I'll look at the places.
- Good idea.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.901
I'll take some Polaroids,
and you can look at them later.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.612
Take a Polaroid, paint a still picture,
whatever you want.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.114
Jess, come on.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.450
Nobody asked me if I wanted to move
to Stars Hollow, but I'm here.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.662
Pick whatever place you want,
and I'll be there, too.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.334
- Mom?
- Come here.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.837
- I'm here. What's the matter?
- Sit.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.256
Okay, that should do it.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.841
- Do what?
- Wait.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.971
- What are we waiting for?
- Patience, grasshopper.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.057
- Are we close?
- Very close.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.394
Getting closer.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.938
- Should I get chips?
- Ready?

14:18.317 --> 14:20.194
The clock is grunting.

14:21.195 --> 14:24.823
This is a state-of-the-art CD clock radio
that enables you to wake up to...

14:24.907 --> 14:27.451
- the barnyard animal of your choice.
- That is great.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.994
I have selected the Perky Piggies.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.622
You might choose the Cheery Chickens
or the Goofy Goats.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.624
This is as close to a farm as I wanna get.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.334
Amen, sister friend.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.835
I'll get it.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.716
- Hey.
- Here.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.511
- The Shags?
- Trust me.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.721
Okay. You're very punctual.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.516
It was this or continue
apartment hunting with Luke.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.643
- You're moving?
- I don't know.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.852
Luke flipped out last night.

14:53.936 --> 14:57.481
Next thing I know, he's dragging me
all over town, measuring square footage.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.650
- It's crazy.
- A new place might be nice.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.610
More space.
Maybe you'll get your own room.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.111
- You changed your hair.
- What?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.864
- Your hair looks different.
- Segue's not your thing?

15:05.906 --> 15:09.159
- Is it?
- No, I wear it like this a lot.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.079
- Why?
- Just looks different.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.206
Bad different?

15:14.248 --> 15:15.541
Ducks!

15:16.375 --> 15:17.835
We just got a new alarm clock.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.255
Bet I know the lead story
in tomorrow's Stars Hollow Gazette.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.589
Did you hear the ducks?

15:22.673 --> 15:26.760
'Cause they are great. Jess, you're here.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.221
Terrific.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.892
Would you like to come in?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.435
Yeah. Come on in.

15:35.519 --> 15:38.605
Sorry, I was just so excited
about the ducks that...

15:38.689 --> 15:40.065
Do you want something to drink?

15:40.107 --> 15:43.652
You have good timing, 'cause we shopped
yesterday, and in addition to...

15:43.735 --> 15:46.363
a case of Maybelline Fresh Lash mascara...

15:46.405 --> 15:50.033
I also bought some of that
new freaky Coke with the lemon in it.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.910
It's very addictive.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.037
- You can sit, you know.
- No, thanks.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.415
- Jess, what's new?
- Not much.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.750
Jess and Luke
are looking for an apartment.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.086
- You guys see anything good yet?
- Nope.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.132
You know, there's some
really cool places over on Peach.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.800
Or on Plum.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.052
Orange.

16:09.678 --> 16:13.015
Basically, any of your fruit-named streets
are pretty nice.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.519
Okay, I guess you should get started.

16:17.978 --> 16:22.608
There's a ladder right out front and some
buckets and gloves and stuff on the porch.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.068
If you need anything else
just walk against the wind.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.945
Come on. I'll show you.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.784
- I'm trying.
- Keep it up.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.710
- Question.
- Yes?

16:41.793 --> 16:45.255
You come over. You seem to have a very
firm grasp of the English language.

16:45.339 --> 16:48.800
You put together several full sentences
using a couple of words that...

16:48.884 --> 16:51.720
contain two or more syllables.
And then my mother appears.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.097
Suddenly, we need a thought bubble
over your head...

16:54.139 --> 16:55.974
to understand what you're thinking. Why?

16:56.058 --> 16:57.476
The verbal thing comes and goes.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.521
I would appreciate it if you would
try to get along with my mom.

17:00.604 --> 17:02.314
- I took the Coke.
- I know.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.817
I think it's a little crazy to put lemon
in Coke, but I took it anyhow.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.612
- Stop it.
- Stern face.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.280
I went out on a limb for you...

17:10.364 --> 17:13.032
trying to get my mom
to give you the benefit of the doubt.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.327
I don't think it would hurt you
to try to be nice.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.912
Why?

17:17.913 --> 17:20.582
Because she's my mom,
and she's a friend of Luke's.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.000
- So?
- What do you mean 'so'?

17:22.084 --> 17:26.338
Because she's your mom or Luke's friend
doesn't mean I have to get along with her.

17:26.380 --> 17:29.883
My mother is a great person.
She's also my best friend in the world.

17:29.967 --> 17:34.388
So if you care about me at all, you will
consider that and be mildly polite to her.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.765
What makes you think I care about you?

17:37.015 --> 17:40.519
I don't mean care, like 'care. '

17:40.602 --> 17:43.939
I mean if you like me at all...
Not 'like,' like.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.025
I just meant
that if you think of me remotely...

17:47.109 --> 17:50.320
as the sort of person that you could
occasionally stand to talk to...

17:50.404 --> 17:52.531
then you will try to get along
with my mom.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.366
Okay.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.910
I can't guarantee that it'll work, but I'll try.

17:56.994 --> 17:59.079
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.456
I should probably get to work.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.834
Right. Sorry. Go ahead.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.526
- Inherit the Wind. Seventy-five cents.
- Great.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.029
Here's a copy of Rilke's
Letters to a Young Poet...

18:32.070 --> 18:33.739
which I already have, but in hardback.

18:33.822 --> 18:37.701
This is a paperback. It fits perfectly
in a coat pocket, and it's only $1.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.036
- Opinions?
- Get it.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.996
- You look bored.
- I'm fine.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.415
Sure you don't want to look?
They have great stuff.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.250
- I looked.
- For five minutes.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.586
No, I looked for 20 minutes,
and then I stopped...

18:47.628 --> 18:49.713
and you continued for another two hours.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.798
It has not been that long.

18:52.883 --> 18:54.259
- Sorry.
- No big deal.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.511
- Let's go.
- Are you done?

18:55.594 --> 18:58.096
- I've looked enough.
- You're not done.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.932
I'm fine, really. Let's go.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.392
Stop it. You want to keep looking.
I know you.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.936
No, I want to hang out with you.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.354
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.731
I'll just pay for these, and then we can go.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.275
I thought we could go see
The Lord of the Rings again.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.610
- Okay.
- What?

19:11.693 --> 19:12.736
Nothing.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.655
- I thought you loved it.
- I do.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.448
You said you wanted to see it 100 times.

19:16.532 --> 19:18.575
Yes, and we're
being very literal these days.

19:18.617 --> 19:21.119
- We'll see something else.
- Lord of the Rings is fine.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.205
Can you help me with these?

19:23.956 --> 19:26.291
- I'll give you 50 cents.
- It's 65.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.127
- Fifty-five cents.
- It's for charity. There's no haggling.

19:29.211 --> 19:32.506
No, there's always haggling. Sixty cents.
That's my final offer.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.591
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Fine.

19:34.633 --> 19:39.221
- Kirk, come on, cough up another nickel.
- Forget it. It's the principle of the thing.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.140
You made out like a bandit.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.767
You've got great stuff this year.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.061
Did you see the astronomy section
over there?

19:46.144 --> 19:47.229
Yeah.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.647
- Didn't find anything?
- Nope.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.566
- I didn't see you look over there.
- I did.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.943
- Go look.
- I told you, I'm done.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.363
- Where's your bracelet?
- What?

19:56.446 --> 19:59.449
You're not wearing your bracelet.
Where is it?

19:59.950 --> 20:01.702
- I took it off.
- Why?

20:02.661 --> 20:05.164
Because I got this weird rash on my wrist.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.125
- From the bracelet?
- No, just a fluke thing.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.503
Actually, I think
my Spanish midterm gave it to me.

20:11.962 --> 20:14.756
- But it's getting better. It's almost gone.
- Good.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.886
As soon as it's completely gone,
that bracelet goes right back on.

20:21.555 --> 20:22.723
- Compromise.
- What?

20:22.806 --> 20:25.559
Look at the astronomy section,
we'll see Lord of the Rings.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.853
On the way home,
we'll rent Autumn in New York...

20:27.936 --> 20:29.021
and mock it all afternoon.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.856
- With full-on impressions?
- Yes.

20:30.939 --> 20:31.982
Deal.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.817
Go. I'll wait here.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.612
Smiling. Not at all bored.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.661
- Sixty-two cents.
- Get out of here, Kirk.

20:44.703 --> 20:45.704
Damn!

21:31.917 --> 21:33.794
Sorry. Too loud?

21:33.877 --> 21:35.379
No, it's fine.

21:36.547 --> 21:38.882
I got a ton of leftover Chinese food
in the kitchen.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.384
Thought you'd like some lunch.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.094
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.226
Chinese sounds great.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.395
Really?

21:52.354 --> 21:54.523
- If you're sure you have enough.
- There's plenty.

21:54.606 --> 21:57.401
Rory and I decided to take on
the chicken column last night.

21:57.442 --> 21:58.777
Ambitious.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.989
It's all out on the table,
so come in when you're ready.

22:02.072 --> 22:05.159
- I'm ready now.
- Okay. Then I'll see you inside.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.049
Basically, everything here is chicken.

22:21.133 --> 22:24.094
You've got garlic chicken,
Kung Pao chicken, Szechwan chicken...

22:24.136 --> 22:27.431
chicken in brown sauce,
which looks like the Szechwan chicken...

22:27.472 --> 22:30.309
except it's got these peppers,
and if you eat them, you die.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.894
- Plate?
- I thought I'd...

22:31.977 --> 22:33.812
Soap's on the counter.

22:33.979 --> 22:36.440
When was the last time
you had those gutters cleaned?

22:36.523 --> 22:37.566
It's been a while.

22:37.649 --> 22:40.319
Yeah, I found an 'I like Ike' bumper sticker
up there.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.322
- Is it really bad?
- It won't be by tomorrow.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.282
I like hearing that.

22:45.491 --> 22:49.661
- You guys aren't too hot on vegetables.
- There's green pepper in the Kung Pao.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.038
My mistake.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.457
Are you a healthy eater like Luke?

22:53.499 --> 22:55.459
No one's a healthy eater like Luke.

22:55.501 --> 22:58.212
Euell Gibbons
wasn't a healthy eater like Luke.

22:58.295 --> 23:01.048
It's been ages since I heard
a good Euell Gibbons reference.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.175
- Many parts of the pine tree are edible.
- Right.

23:03.258 --> 23:06.303
Wonder what the research process
was like to get that information.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.597
- I'd say fairly painful.
- Here.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.852
- How's school?
- It's still there.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.689
You on any teams or anything?

23:19.650 --> 23:21.902
- Not a jersey guy?
- Definitely not a jersey guy.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.696
Though the thought of throwing
a ball at some jock's head...

23:24.780 --> 23:26.865
isn't entirely unappealing.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.703
Look, I'm not really good
at this small-talk thing.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.455
You're doing okay.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.749
- Cold egg roll?
- Why not?

23:40.337 --> 23:41.922
- Bad?
- Yeah.

23:44.716 --> 23:47.135
- Mom!
- Right here. What?

23:49.096 --> 23:50.138
What's going on?

23:50.222 --> 23:51.682
- I don't know where it is.
- What?

23:51.723 --> 23:52.850
My bracelet. It's gone.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.476
What are you talking about?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.103
How could I lose that bracelet?

23:56.186 --> 23:58.397
Tell me which bracelet.
Maybe I stole it from you.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.523
Dean's bracelet.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.859
The one he made you? It's gone? Where?

24:01.900 --> 24:04.027
I don't know.
If I knew where, I would have it.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.071
When did you first notice it was gone?

24:06.154 --> 24:08.907
- When he pointed out I wasn't wearing it.
- What did you say?

24:08.991 --> 24:11.535
That I had a rash
and had to take it off until it healed.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.871
- Nice save, Gretzky.
- It's not here.

24:14.246 --> 24:16.373
Let's retrace your steps.

24:16.415 --> 24:19.168
When was the last time
you remember wearing it?

24:19.251 --> 24:20.878
- I don't know.
- Think hard. Yesterday?

24:20.919 --> 24:22.379
- I don't know.
- The day before?

24:22.421 --> 24:23.630
- The day before that?
- Yeah.

24:23.714 --> 24:26.091
- Really?
- No. I don't remember. I can't remember.

24:26.175 --> 24:27.593
Help me move the couch.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.094
What about your locker at school?

24:29.136 --> 24:30.679
I don't know why it would be there.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.432
I never take it off at school.
I never take it off at all.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.933
- Anything?
- Just Grandma's pen.

24:34.975 --> 24:36.560
Leave it there. It makes life fun.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.770
- I'm gonna freak out now.
- We'll find it.

24:38.854 --> 24:41.773
- I'll have to tell Dean that I lost it.
- Let's not go there yet.

24:41.857 --> 24:43.442
- He made it.
- He'll make another one.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.235
- He's gonna be mad.
- He'll understand.

24:45.277 --> 24:46.278
How do you know?

24:46.361 --> 24:49.031
Looking at the track record,
all signs point to it.

24:49.114 --> 24:50.866
- Did you look in your room?
- No.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.701
I'll check the car, and don't worry.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.746
If we can't find it,
we'll follow Dean to work...

24:55.787 --> 24:58.207
hide behind the cantaloupes,
jump him, blind him...

24:58.290 --> 24:59.291
and he'll never find out.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.418
As long as we have a plan.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.063
Who is Randy Meenge?

25:21.146 --> 25:23.607
Let me see. Maintenance.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.568
Are you going to be down there long?

25:26.652 --> 25:30.489
I just want to make sure Rory's bracelet
didn't get kicked behind something.

25:30.531 --> 25:33.325
And so earlier when you asked me
to look for the bracelet...

25:33.367 --> 25:36.537
and I told you I did look,
and I did not find it, you...

25:36.620 --> 25:37.830
Just decided to double-check.

25:37.913 --> 25:40.999
Yes, though another theory
is that you did not believe me.

25:41.083 --> 25:42.125
I did, too.

25:42.209 --> 25:44.002
I believe you thought I was lying...

25:44.044 --> 25:46.630
that I did not actually get down
on my hands and knees...

25:46.672 --> 25:49.591
in a brand-new Donna Karan suit
and crawl around on a floor...

25:49.675 --> 25:52.761
where people who have stepped in
mud and garbage and animal waste...

25:52.845 --> 25:55.055
have been traipsing all day long.

25:55.681 --> 25:58.141
- It's not there.
- No? Why, I'm shocked.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.227
I'm sorry I doubted you, Michel.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.187
That means a lot. Thank you.

26:02.437 --> 26:05.899
We turned the house upside down.
Rory's having a heart attack. It's awful.

26:05.983 --> 26:09.278
As soon as my dry-cleaning bill is paid,
you will have my sympathies.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.697
I will pay for your suit, Michel.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.199
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

26:14.366 --> 26:17.077
Hold on, please. It's for you.

26:17.786 --> 26:18.745
Lorelai here.

26:18.829 --> 26:20.622
I don't want a wood-burning fireplace...

26:20.706 --> 26:22.457
but if I take an apartment with one...

26:22.541 --> 26:25.502
even though I could give
a rat's ass about it...

26:25.586 --> 26:28.589
I have to pay an extra $200 a month for it.

26:29.298 --> 26:31.800
Three of the places make you
put down a $500 deposit...

26:31.884 --> 26:32.885
if you have a dog!

26:32.968 --> 26:35.012
- You don't have a dog.
- I know, but it's wrong.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.889
- Agreed. What else?
- Parking!

26:37.306 --> 26:40.309
How can people ask you
for a monthly fee for a parking space?

26:40.392 --> 26:42.811
They're making money off your rent,
your utilities...

26:42.895 --> 26:45.147
when you use their coin-operated
washer and dryer.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.191
That's cash directly in their pocket...

26:47.274 --> 26:49.526
and it's not even
that good a parking space.

26:49.568 --> 26:51.820
It's out in the open
under one of those trees...

26:51.904 --> 26:54.448
that drops the sap on your car
that eats away the paint.

26:54.531 --> 26:55.949
Who's gonna pay for my car?

26:56.033 --> 26:59.244
Where's my $500 paint-killing,
tree-sap deposit?

26:59.328 --> 27:00.662
You haven't found a place yet?

27:00.746 --> 27:02.164
And I've been looking all day.

27:02.247 --> 27:04.333
- There wasn't one place you liked?
- No.

27:04.416 --> 27:07.503
Not one place that gave you
a little feeling of:

27:07.586 --> 27:09.755
'That has a nice vibe about it. '

27:09.838 --> 27:11.882
I don't use the word 'vibe. '

27:12.925 --> 27:15.260
Maybe one place wasn't so bad.

27:15.302 --> 27:16.637
Good! Describe it to me.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.140
It had walls
with a kind of a floor with a light.

27:20.224 --> 27:22.559
Hold on here. If you tell me it's got a roof...

27:22.601 --> 27:24.186
I'm stealing that baby from you.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.730
I just can't tell anymore.
I need a second opinion.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.440
Want me to look at your apartment?

27:28.524 --> 27:30.984
- It's not my apartment, and yes.
- Done.

27:31.068 --> 27:32.444
- Now.
- What?

27:32.486 --> 27:33.487
Please.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.073
I promised the woman
I'd give her an answer today.

27:36.114 --> 27:37.491
Okay, give me the address.

27:37.574 --> 27:40.577
62/, B Street, and that's another thing...

27:40.619 --> 27:42.246
what's with this 'half' business?

27:42.287 --> 27:45.165
Why do all these apartments
have this 'half' thing going?

27:45.249 --> 27:48.585
It's stupid. If 62 is taken, move on to 63.

27:48.627 --> 27:50.504
I'll meet you in 20-and-a-half minutes.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.089
- Thank you.
- Bye.

27:52.965 --> 27:56.134
Michel, I have to go out for a little while.
Cover the desk for me.

27:57.219 --> 27:58.303
What?

27:58.762 --> 28:01.014
I'll say I'll cover the desk...

28:01.098 --> 28:03.183
but how will you know
if I'm actually doing it?

28:03.267 --> 28:04.309
I trust you.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.687
It's just as possible
I say I'll cover the desk...

28:06.770 --> 28:08.272
and the moment you stepped away...

28:08.355 --> 28:11.024
I'll put some fruit on my head
and join a conga line.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.776
I believe you looked for the bracelet.

28:12.818 --> 28:15.153
While I am shaking it
to the Miami Sound Machine...

28:15.237 --> 28:19.783
the phones here, they would ring and ring,
and no one to answer, no one to assist.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.201
Okay. Bye.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.037
It's a very quiet street...

28:24.121 --> 28:26.290
and the owner keeps
the building up beautifully.

28:26.331 --> 28:28.333
He hasn't remodeled it at all.

28:28.375 --> 28:32.462
Plus, I bet he could be persuaded
to give the floor a little spruce if you like.

28:32.546 --> 28:34.506
- We'd like a spruce.
- Spruce is unnecessary.

28:34.548 --> 28:36.091
Never turn down a spruce.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.594
- She's right. Listen to her.
- Yeah, listen to me.

28:38.677 --> 28:41.638
- You rarely give me a choice.
- Come here so I can lick your face.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.725
I went over the square footage
and the details of the lease...

28:44.808 --> 28:47.311
with your husband this morning.
Did he fill you in?

28:47.352 --> 28:51.523
- What? No...
- He didn't, but you know how men are.

28:51.607 --> 28:53.358
The minute that ball game comes on...

28:53.400 --> 28:55.903
all the realities of life
just go right out the window.

28:55.986 --> 28:56.987
Don't I know it.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.239
I could answer the door wrapped
in cellophane...

28:59.323 --> 29:02.826
but unless I was wearing a Yankees cap,
he wouldn't even notice.

29:02.868 --> 29:05.579
Don't be embarrassed, snuffy.
I'm just teasing.

29:05.662 --> 29:06.788
It'd be a Mets cap.

29:06.872 --> 29:11.084
Mary, could you possibly
leave me and little missus alone...

29:11.168 --> 29:12.377
for just a minute?

29:12.461 --> 29:15.297
- Of course.
- I promise we won't do anything dirty.

29:15.589 --> 29:18.300
If my husband and I looked
anything like the two of you...

29:18.383 --> 29:19.510
we'd never get dressed.

29:19.593 --> 29:20.886
You are bad.

29:20.969 --> 29:23.096
Let me leave
this rental agreement with you...

29:23.180 --> 29:24.890
in case you decide to fill it out.

29:24.973 --> 29:26.183
Thanks.

29:26.725 --> 29:28.519
I hope you take it.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.939
It's got a great vibe
for a nice couple like you two.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.817
- Thirteen shades of red.
- What is wrong with you?

29:35.901 --> 29:37.778
- You make it too easy.
- By standing here?

29:37.861 --> 29:39.738
Relax, snuffy. What do you think?

29:39.780 --> 29:41.073
She used the word 'vibe. '

29:41.114 --> 29:42.658
- About the apartment?
- I don't know.

29:42.741 --> 29:44.535
Break it down. List your concerns.

29:44.576 --> 29:46.870
- It's too big.
- It's not too big. Next.

29:46.912 --> 29:49.414
- I don't need two bathrooms.
- Yes, you do. Next.

29:49.498 --> 29:52.042
- I like being on the bottom floor.
- Top floor's quieter.

29:52.125 --> 29:55.587
I think this would be easier
if you listed your concerns first.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.632
- I don't have any. It's great.
- You do?

29:58.715 --> 30:02.636
Yeah, it's light and airy,
it's got good windows...

30:02.719 --> 30:05.514
but not too many so that the sun
bakes you in the afternoon.

30:05.597 --> 30:06.557
Thank you.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.433
It's close to work, the price is good...

30:08.517 --> 30:10.853
you're taking the spruce,
and it's a two-year lease.

30:10.936 --> 30:13.188
- I don't know.
- You need to do this.

30:13.272 --> 30:15.482
You and Jess will kill each other
in your place.

30:15.566 --> 30:18.360
But who knows
how long he's gonna be here?

30:18.443 --> 30:21.029
- Why? Did something happen?
- No, but you never know.

30:21.113 --> 30:24.032
I think his mom sending his stuff
is a pretty good sign.

30:24.116 --> 30:26.410
Even if he stays,
it'll only be for another year...

30:26.451 --> 30:30.205
and then he'll go off to college or Attica,
and it'll just be me again.

30:30.289 --> 30:33.375
I'll be stuck in a new apartment,
probably with neighbors I hate...

30:33.458 --> 30:36.962
who are constantly cooking
really strong-smelling food.

30:37.045 --> 30:38.088
Back up here.

30:38.130 --> 30:40.424
Yes, Jess may go off
somewhere someday...

30:40.465 --> 30:43.010
but that doesn't mean
you will be alone forever.

30:43.093 --> 30:46.305
- I am not getting a pet.
- I'm talking about a lady friend.

30:46.847 --> 30:48.849
- A red-hot mama.
- Okay.

30:48.932 --> 30:52.477
Big, pretty dish of loving
with a spoon made especially for you.

30:52.561 --> 30:54.688
Boy, do I not feel good now.

30:54.813 --> 30:58.233
Luke, RacheI's not the only woman
in the world for you.

30:58.317 --> 31:01.820
You'll meet someone someday,
probably at a Timberland store.

31:01.904 --> 31:04.448
You'll ask her out, you'll pick her up...

31:04.490 --> 31:07.534
take her on a patented
'Luke Danes night of romance. '

31:07.618 --> 31:09.286
Juice bar, then the batting cages...

31:09.328 --> 31:11.497
and then you'll ask her back
to your apartment.

31:11.580 --> 31:13.290
Any amount of money if you stop now.

31:13.332 --> 31:18.003
You'll bring her back to your place,
lead her upstairs to the apartment door.

31:18.795 --> 31:21.298
You pause, gaze into her eyes.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.343
The stage is set. Fate is waiting.

31:24.885 --> 31:29.348
You open the door, and she sees
your teeny, tiny apartment...

31:29.431 --> 31:32.851
one room and no closet space,
and Jess' feet sticking up in the air...

31:32.893 --> 31:35.312
- 'cause you never got rid of the body...
- Stop, please.

31:35.354 --> 31:37.981
To make matters worse, she spots it...

31:38.440 --> 31:40.108
the single bed!

31:40.192 --> 31:41.318
What's wrong with that?

31:41.360 --> 31:42.945
- You know what they say.
- What?

31:43.028 --> 31:44.988
Never, ever date a guy
who owns a single bed.

31:45.072 --> 31:46.657
It means he's not open to commitment.

31:46.698 --> 31:49.284
It says, 'There's no room in this life
for anybody else. '

31:49.368 --> 31:51.495
It says, 'No room in this bed
for anybody else. '

31:51.578 --> 31:53.872
- That's not much better.
- This discussion is over.

31:53.956 --> 31:57.000
As long as you're in that apartment,
you'll have a single bed.

31:57.042 --> 31:59.753
Don't you want the possibility of more?

31:59.920 --> 32:03.340
Come on, Luke, it's time.
Make a move, take a shot.

32:03.382 --> 32:06.051
Entertain the possibility
of a non-Unabomber existence.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.719
What do you say?

32:08.345 --> 32:10.347
- You got a pen?
- Of course.

32:11.807 --> 32:14.601
- I'm not taking the spruce.
- Yes, you are.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.703
- Did you get lost?
- No, I was looking at Rory's books.

32:33.162 --> 32:36.456
I wanted to see if she had
Franny and Zooey. She does.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.709
- Okay.
- I was gonna get it for her if she didn't.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.086
- That's very nice of you.
- Yeah.

32:43.630 --> 32:46.133
Okay. I should probably get back to work.

33:03.442 --> 33:04.776
Luke! Good.

33:04.860 --> 33:07.070
I was on my way
to the diner to talk to you.

33:07.112 --> 33:08.489
Go on over. I'll meet you there.

33:08.572 --> 33:10.782
Stop it. This isn't gonna make you mad.

33:10.866 --> 33:13.410
I just have a couple of questions
about your application.

33:13.494 --> 33:15.954
- I called your bank.
- What application?

33:16.038 --> 33:19.291
Your application for the apartment.
You have two accounts...

33:19.333 --> 33:22.461
- How did you get my application?
- Mary gave it to me.

33:22.544 --> 33:24.004
I'm assuming one of the accounts...

33:24.087 --> 33:26.298
Why would Mary give you my application?

33:26.381 --> 33:27.549
Because I own the building.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.259
When did you buy an apartment building?

33:29.343 --> 33:31.386
I bought this one about two months ago.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.847
I look at a thousand apartments,
I choose yours. How?

33:33.931 --> 33:35.724
Count yourself lucky.

33:36.141 --> 33:39.186
With me as the owner,
there is a level of quality control...

33:39.269 --> 33:40.896
that is sorely lacking in this town.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.940
For example, at all my properties...

33:42.981 --> 33:46.151
we measure the grass before,
during, and after mowing...

33:46.235 --> 33:48.612
to attain a perfect 1.5- Inch height...

33:48.654 --> 33:50.989
which is pleasing to the eye
and good for the grass.

33:51.073 --> 33:52.324
All of your properties?

33:52.407 --> 33:53.575
Ten in all.

33:53.659 --> 33:55.244
What, are you buying up the town?

33:55.327 --> 33:57.371
Not yet, but someday, who knows?

33:57.454 --> 33:58.956
Why isn't anyone stopping you?

33:58.997 --> 34:00.958
Because people are lazy...

34:00.999 --> 34:04.169
they don't want to think
about the proper fabric for an awning...

34:04.253 --> 34:06.255
or the correct historical color
for a building.

34:06.338 --> 34:09.382
They just slap any old thing up on a wall
and sleep like babies.

34:09.466 --> 34:12.469
But soon, hopefully,
the city council will put an end to that.

34:12.553 --> 34:15.179
You can't tell people
what color to paint their buildings.

34:15.264 --> 34:16.348
Someone has to.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.475
No, we don't live in a fascist country.

34:18.516 --> 34:21.478
This isn't about the fascists,
who, by the way...

34:21.520 --> 34:24.063
had their faults,
but their parks were spotless.

34:24.147 --> 34:26.065
I have to get out of here.

34:26.149 --> 34:27.400
Wait a minute.

34:28.985 --> 34:31.029
Hold it! I still need to talk to you.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.197
Just tear up the application.
I'm not moving.

34:33.282 --> 34:35.742
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm a 2-inch-grass kind of guy.

34:35.826 --> 34:38.536
That's too bad.
I need to talk to you about something else.

34:38.620 --> 34:41.415
I'm thinking of buying
the flower shop next to the diner...

34:41.498 --> 34:44.208
but we need to talk
about that sign of yours.

34:44.251 --> 34:45.627
What about my sign?

34:45.710 --> 34:48.880
You never took down
the 'Williams Hardware' sign.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.257
That was my father's sign.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.676
I understand you have
a sentimental attachment...

34:52.717 --> 34:54.594
to the sign, but it confuses the tourists.

34:54.678 --> 34:55.846
Back off the sign.

34:55.929 --> 34:59.933
If I buy the building next to that sign,
I run the risk of people being so busy...

35:00.017 --> 35:02.811
trying to figure out
if you sell hammers or burgers...

35:02.895 --> 35:06.106
that they never notice
the nice collectible-plate store next door.

35:06.190 --> 35:09.234
- Collectible plates?
- Isn't that a great idea?

35:09.318 --> 35:12.613
Elvis, The Beatles, Mary Poppins.
All the greats!

35:12.696 --> 35:15.991
You can hang them on the wall,
or buy a little stand and set them up...

35:16.074 --> 35:20.078
You need to get away from me now.
At least a good arm-swinging length away.

35:20.162 --> 35:22.080
It's people like you who keep this town...

35:22.164 --> 35:24.625
from becoming
one of the great towns in America!

35:24.708 --> 35:25.876
Arm-swinging length!

35:25.918 --> 35:29.087
I wouldn't have approved
your application anyway.

35:42.309 --> 35:44.311
- You look good.
- I'm fine.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.104
Talk.

35:47.231 --> 35:49.107
I lost my bracelet.

35:49.441 --> 35:51.819
- Dean gave it to me.
- How thoughtful.

35:51.902 --> 35:53.612
I've been all over town looking for it.

35:53.695 --> 35:55.823
I've been to Lane's, I've been to Luke's...

35:55.906 --> 35:58.450
I've been to the bus stop,
I've been to Miss Patty's...

35:58.534 --> 36:00.828
and I've circled Stars Hollow twice,
and nothing.

36:00.911 --> 36:03.163
I have no idea what I'm going to do.

36:03.247 --> 36:05.415
- It's really that big a deal?
- What do you mean?

36:05.499 --> 36:08.252
I know it's got
an 'I've been pinned, Bye Bye Birdie'...

36:08.293 --> 36:11.004
kind of implication to it,
but it was just a bracelet.

36:11.088 --> 36:12.923
I don't think Dean will see it that way.

36:12.965 --> 36:14.758
You didn't lose it on purpose.

36:14.800 --> 36:18.095
I know, but things have been
a little weird between us lately...

36:18.136 --> 36:19.555
and you couldn't care less.

36:19.638 --> 36:21.098
Yes, I could.

36:21.807 --> 36:23.934
I just think Dean
will read something into this.

36:23.976 --> 36:25.519
- Should he?
- No.

36:27.354 --> 36:28.981
I think you should keep looking.

36:29.064 --> 36:30.691
- Where?
- Anywhere.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.443
Things you lose
are usually in front of your face.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.654
- Check the house again.
- I've checked the house.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.447
It's probably laying in your room.

36:37.489 --> 36:39.449
I tore that room apart. It's not there.

36:39.491 --> 36:43.328
Fine. Give up. No biggie.
Dean will just have to get over it.

36:44.663 --> 36:46.373
I'll go look again.

36:49.793 --> 36:51.170
You do that.

36:54.506 --> 36:56.258
Where have you been?

36:56.717 --> 36:58.385
Scouring the town.

36:58.594 --> 37:00.470
- Nothing?
- Not yet.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.097
I'm gonna check my room again.

37:02.181 --> 37:04.683
Haven't you looked in there 1,000 times?

37:04.766 --> 37:06.518
A thousand and one.

37:07.853 --> 37:09.188
Mom, come here, hurry.

37:09.229 --> 37:11.190
Rory? Are you okay?

37:13.066 --> 37:14.526
- I found it!
- What?

37:14.610 --> 37:16.487
I looked under the bed, and there it was.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.280
I thought I had looked under the bed...

37:18.363 --> 37:20.407
but I don't know,
maybe I was too panicked.

37:20.491 --> 37:21.617
Who cares? I got it.

37:21.700 --> 37:25.162
- That is amazing!
- Put it on. Make it tight.

37:25.245 --> 37:27.039
I'm cutting off circulation here, baby.

37:27.122 --> 37:29.583
Look at it. It looks even better than before.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.543
I think the time away from home
did it good.

37:31.627 --> 37:33.712
- When I return, we celebrate.
- Where you going?

37:33.795 --> 37:36.215
To tell Lane she can stop praying.

37:55.734 --> 37:57.736
- Leaving?
- Yeah, all done.

37:57.945 --> 37:59.863
You weren't gonna come get your money?

37:59.905 --> 38:01.323
I figured I'd get it eventually.

38:01.406 --> 38:03.242
I know where you guys live.

38:03.283 --> 38:05.828
You certainly do know where we live.

38:06.745 --> 38:07.830
Here.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.292
After all, you earned it.

38:13.293 --> 38:14.378
Thanks.

38:14.461 --> 38:16.421
You took it, didn't you?

38:16.505 --> 38:17.548
Excuse me?

38:17.631 --> 38:19.800
Rory's bracelet. You had it the whole time.

38:19.883 --> 38:21.426
No idea what you're talking about.

38:21.510 --> 38:23.762
- How'd you get it?
- I didn't get anything.

38:23.804 --> 38:25.472
Did you break into our house?

38:25.556 --> 38:28.058
You dressed in black,
and pulled a Mission: Lmpossible?

38:28.100 --> 38:30.352
I came down the chimney
and pulled a Santa Claus.

38:30.435 --> 38:31.436
Very funny.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.772
A ridiculous accusation
deserved such a response.

38:33.814 --> 38:37.025
It's just a coincidence I catch you
coming out of Rory's room...

38:37.109 --> 38:40.487
a half an hour before she mysteriously
finds the bracelet under her bed?

38:40.571 --> 38:42.364
- Guess so.
- Why would you do this?

38:42.447 --> 38:43.407
I gotta go.

38:43.490 --> 38:45.951
I know you hate the world,
but I thought you liked Rory.

38:46.034 --> 38:47.536
- I didn't do anything.
- Bull.

38:47.619 --> 38:48.579
Whatever.

38:48.662 --> 38:49.955
Don't 'whatever' me, you jerk.

38:49.997 --> 38:52.040
You let Rory run around
completely panicked...

38:52.124 --> 38:54.960
thinking she lost the bracelet.
She was miserable. Understand?

38:55.043 --> 38:56.044
I didn't take it.

38:56.128 --> 38:58.422
You're jealous of Dean
because he's great...

38:58.463 --> 39:00.340
and Rory's madly in love with him.

39:00.424 --> 39:03.260
But you taking the bracelet
didn't hurt Dean, it hurt Rory.

39:03.302 --> 39:05.554
That bracelet is the most precious thing
she owns.

39:05.637 --> 39:07.973
She never takes it off.
It means everything to her.

39:08.056 --> 39:10.100
And you stealing it was unbelievably cruel.

39:10.184 --> 39:12.144
- The most precious thing she owns?
- Yes!

39:12.186 --> 39:14.438
If it's the most precious thing she owns...

39:14.479 --> 39:17.774
why did it take her two weeks
to figure out it was gone?

39:17.816 --> 39:20.652
You might want to reevaluate
how madly in love she is.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.154
I wouldn't call him 'son' yet.

39:22.237 --> 39:24.740
- Get out of here.
- You read my mind.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.895
I just spent $100,000,
and it's all your fault!

39:56.438 --> 39:57.523
Good.

39:58.357 --> 40:00.108
I ran into Taylor at the market.

40:00.192 --> 40:03.111
I found out he owns the building
that apartment was in.

40:03.195 --> 40:04.279
No way.

40:04.363 --> 40:06.532
- That and several others in town.
- So weird.

40:06.615 --> 40:08.367
He's systematically buying up the town.

40:08.408 --> 40:11.495
He'll turn it into Taylorville,
where everyone wears cardigans...

40:11.537 --> 40:13.956
- and have the same grass height.
- Do you want to sit?

40:14.039 --> 40:16.583
Then he said he'll buy the building
next to the diner...

40:16.667 --> 40:17.835
turn it into a plate shop...

40:17.876 --> 40:20.379
for freaks who don't have
the brainpower to collect stamps!

40:20.462 --> 40:21.839
- I lost it!
- I can't picture it.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.800
I walked around in a blind rage.
I was crazy.

40:24.883 --> 40:28.220
I bought a Belgian waffle
with ice cream dipped in chocolate.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.222
- You ate that?
- No, I didn't eat it.

40:30.264 --> 40:31.765
I'm upset, not suicidal.

40:31.849 --> 40:34.935
I had to do something.
I had your voice going round in my head.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.687
It's like the Small World song.

40:36.770 --> 40:39.731
'Take a chance, Luke. Make a move.
Can't have a single bed. '

40:39.815 --> 40:41.817
So I bought the building!

40:41.900 --> 40:42.860
You what?

40:42.943 --> 40:44.695
Went to the bank, got a cashier's check...

40:44.736 --> 40:46.780
signed the papers,
and I bought the building.

40:46.864 --> 40:49.741
I am the building's owner.
I own the building.

40:49.783 --> 40:52.327
Okay, don't worry,
you can still get out of it.

40:52.411 --> 40:54.246
You can tell them you lost your mind.

40:54.329 --> 40:57.291
- Or I bet you could sell it to Taylor.
- Yeah.

40:57.416 --> 41:01.295
Relax. You can still get out of this,
unless you don't want to get out of this.

41:01.378 --> 41:05.257
No, I want to get out of this.
Why would I not want to get out of this?

41:05.340 --> 41:08.385
Owning that building
gives you some options.

41:09.219 --> 41:10.220
Like?

41:10.304 --> 41:13.223
Like you could expand Luke's
if you wanted to.

41:14.349 --> 41:16.935
Or you could rent it to someone else.

41:17.603 --> 41:20.189
Someone else
who might drive Taylor crazy.

41:20.272 --> 41:21.565
I should think about this.

41:21.607 --> 41:24.151
- Sure, sleep on it.
- Right.

41:24.234 --> 41:27.279
- Do you want some tea?
- Tea's good. Sure. Yeah.

41:34.953 --> 41:37.414
Does Jess ever talk to you about Rory?

41:37.498 --> 41:38.874
What do you mean?

41:38.957 --> 41:42.169
They seem to be thrown together
quite a lot lately.

41:42.252 --> 41:45.297
I was trying to figure out
if that's a coincidence...

41:45.380 --> 41:47.925
Or if there's something going on?
I don't know.

41:48.008 --> 41:50.802
- Jess doesn't exactly confide in me.
- Right.

41:50.844 --> 41:53.388
If there was something on,
I think it'd be great.

41:53.472 --> 41:54.431
You do?

41:54.515 --> 41:58.268

42:05.818 --> 42:08.779
