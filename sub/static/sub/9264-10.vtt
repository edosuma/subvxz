Franckly, you're not a mother.
You have no idea what was the situation.

00:05.516 --> 00:09.116
Sometime, we're gonna have a whole
conversation where you don't say that.

00:09.398 --> 00:11.544
- You come out of there.
- You gotta calm down.

00:11.813 --> 00:14.771
You don't just open the door.
This is not your house anymore.

00:16.579 --> 00:19.752
What I say you had to do to stay here?
Did I tell you how to feed the furrets?

00:19.920 --> 00:23.345
<i>You take care of yourself,
everything else take care of itself.</i>

00:23.863 --> 00:25.704
They're not pressing charges.

00:32.906 --> 00:36.305
<i>We're interupting your programing
for some important wheater information</i>

00:36.465 --> 00:38.365

wheater center.</i>

00:38.525 --> 00:40.451

00:42.525 --> 00:45.229
<i>and a tornado watch continues

00:45.849 --> 00:48.469
- <i>Very heavy rainfall.</i>
- I know that look.

00:48.762 --> 00:50.820
- Someone's hungry.
- I know that, it's time.

00:51.149 --> 00:53.017
Come one baby.
Thank you.

00:53.327 --> 00:55.793
Would you something nice?
Oh my God.

00:56.695 --> 00:59.553
I'm out of formula.
You are such a little pig, you know?

00:59.826 --> 01:01.358
You eat so much, you gotta stop.

01:01.518 --> 01:03.428
What happens
when you shame people with food?

01:04.032 --> 01:07.130
- What ?
- Anorexia. Especially in girls.

01:07.411 --> 01:08.961
Thank you, Oprah.
Very helpful.

01:09.463 --> 01:12.457
- Okay, maybe I did see it on Oprah.
- Oh, busted.

01:13.096 --> 01:14.964
I don't know
what I'm gonna do because...

01:15.569 --> 01:18.585
I mean, Shelly's boobies,
there're not gonna do the trick, right?

01:20.755 --> 01:22.202
I'll go to the store.

01:22.504 --> 01:25.162
- I don't want you to go in this weather.
- See you soon.

01:27.090 --> 01:30.923
God, he's cute. No, but he's jailbait.
We stay away, okay darling?

01:38.811 --> 01:40.991
I'm heading to the store,
you need anything?

01:42.323 --> 01:43.847
Can I go with you?

01:49.789 --> 01:52.523
So, are you going to the dance,
this week-end?

01:52.953 --> 01:54.775
Are you going to fall formal?

01:56.701 --> 01:59.583
No, I'm not going.
Are you?

02:01.339 --> 02:04.708
No. I mean, it's kinda lame, right?

02:07.570 --> 02:10.822
So I heard, Matty dumped
that cheerleader, is that true?

02:11.911 --> 02:14.858
I don't know, I mean,
we don't talk.

02:21.522 --> 02:23.137
It cleared up pretty good.

02:23.399 --> 02:24.482
Let's go!

02:32.286 --> 02:33.770
What are you doing?

02:34.966 --> 02:37.028
Nothing. Let's go.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.519
She's gonna teeth soon, right?

02:40.879 --> 02:42.577
Yeah, in like a year.
