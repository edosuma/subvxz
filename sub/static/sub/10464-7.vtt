00:12.637 --> 00:14.230
I'm sorry, it's not you.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.617
You wanna go to the coffee shop,

00:16.641 --> 00:18.151
maybe catch a buzz or something?

00:18.309 --> 00:19.694
They're closed.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.571
You know, it's late.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.157
How about some music, then?

00:25.650 --> 00:27.744
<i>- ♪ We cannot choose ♪</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:29.495
That's my dad.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.583
Hey, hey, I love this song.

00:33.825 --> 00:34.927
<i>♪ But she wasn't home... ♪</i>

00:34.951 --> 00:36.461
I can loan you the CD.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.047
I'm sleepy.

00:39.330 --> 00:44.927
Well, why don't you crash out on my
shoulder and watch the sun come up.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.898
Griffin, we've gotta
go to school tomorrow.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.223
Can't we just go home?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.570
Just a little bit longer.

00:52.594 --> 00:53.770
Griffin...

00:54.137 --> 00:55.605
I'm not ready to go home.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.732
Why not?

00:59.434 --> 01:02.945
You know, it's weird, but I've
never been to your house before.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.281
What's weird about it?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.533
Well, it's just...

01:10.320 --> 01:11.964
I don't... Uh, never mind.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.331
I'll take you home.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.712
Wow. Tight.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.217
Quarterly payroll taxes.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.676
Right there.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.346
Finally got 'em done,

01:28.963 --> 01:31.057
and then Joe calls at two,

01:31.674 --> 01:33.768
and wants me to fax
everything to him.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.728
In Newfoundland?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.230
Nova Scotia.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.607
He doesn't get this
time zone thing.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.204
So I take care of that,
and then he calls again

01:43.228 --> 01:45.289
and he wants to know why
we're still showing a loss.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.124
So I spend another 45 minutes

01:47.148 --> 01:49.293
telling him about the
whole lounge-night thing

01:49.317 --> 01:52.662
and the two-for-one
happy hour disaster,

01:53.613 --> 01:55.164
and that made him happy.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.593
So you tried a few new things.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.128
I mean, those things always
take time to catch on.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.588
Yeah, tell that to Joe.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.424
Ow.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.434
That's him.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.019
That's the Joe spot.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.176
Ahh!

02:12.507 --> 02:14.100
You should get some sleep.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.769
I'm wired.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.897
Been mainlining
coffee all night.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.739
You wanna fool around?

02:29.524 --> 02:30.783
Mm-hm.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.754
Listen, Joe, I don't know
what time it is there, but...

02:45.874 --> 02:47.133
I'm sorry. Who?

02:48.751 --> 02:49.969
What?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.613
<i>Station 47 to Company 48.</i>

02:59.637 --> 03:01.564
<i>What's your status, please?
Over.</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:03.325
We're up here at
Salinger's Restaurant.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.735
On our way back. ETA 20 minutes.
Over.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.551
<i>♪ Everybody wants to live ♪</i>

03:20.575 --> 03:22.386
<i>♪ Like they wanna live ♪</i>

03:22.410 --> 03:25.671

03:25.747 --> 03:27.433

03:36.132 --> 03:39.143

03:46.601 --> 03:48.621
Okay, last one.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.948
Damage estimate and
certificate of identity.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.375
How long before I
can get a check?

03:53.399 --> 03:54.700
Just a couple of days.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.171
First we gotta do a
routine investigation,

03:57.195 --> 03:58.505
determine the cause
of the fire, and...

03:58.529 --> 03:59.965
I thought they said
it was electrical.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.133
Standard procedure.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.011
And then we can start
releasing funds.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.096
We know how it is with
small businesses.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.641
Can't afford to be shut
down for too long, right?

04:08.665 --> 04:10.758
Not that it would make much
difference with this business.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.220
So it shouldn't take much
longer than a day or so.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.765
Oh, uh,

04:17.966 --> 04:19.692
did I say I was sorry
about the fire?

04:19.716 --> 04:20.976
You did.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.738
- Thanks, Mr. Arbogast.
- Sure.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.272
I really appreciate it.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.277
Yes! Yes!

04:29.352 --> 04:30.454
Charlie?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.622
What?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.958
That man, that... that
sweet little man,

04:33.982 --> 04:37.253
just showed me an
estimate for $50,000!

04:37.277 --> 04:38.337
Fifty grand! That...

04:38.361 --> 04:39.922
That's twice as much as
repairs will cost me

04:39.946 --> 04:41.914
if I shop the work out myself.

04:42.156 --> 04:45.803
I just made $25,000
instant profit.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.596
Just don't forget
about the deficit.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.931
That's the whole point, Jule.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.715
This is the best thing
that could have happened.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.550
Charlie, that's great!

04:53.126 --> 04:54.802
I can't believe you guys.

04:54.877 --> 04:58.440
I mean, Dad's restaurant
practically burns down,

04:58.464 --> 05:00.850
and you just act like we
just won the lottery.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.028
Claud, the restaurant
did not burn down.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.905
It'll be up and running
again in two weeks.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.314
In the black.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.409
Man, if I'd known it
was worth this much

05:08.433 --> 05:10.610
I'd have torched the
place a long time ago.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.543
- Hey.
- Julia.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.794
Oh, hey.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.171
I thought maybe we could
walk to school or something.

05:21.195 --> 05:24.383
Uh... why don't you go ahead?
I got some stuff I gotta do.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.676
Well, I can wait for you.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.428
No, that's all right.
I'll see you in...

05:27.452 --> 05:29.388
- I'll see you in school.
- Griffin! Griffin!

05:29.412 --> 05:30.921
Just give me a second.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.183
Don't you ever walk out on
me when I'm talking to you.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.476
Do you understand me?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.979
I wanna know why I'm still
getting calls from school

05:37.003 --> 05:38.313
telling me you're cutting class.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.482
- Dad, not now. - You've already
been held back, one year,

05:40.506 --> 05:42.109
And now you're
flunking out again?

05:42.133 --> 05:45.988
You know, all you care about is that
damn motorcycle and chasing girls!

05:46.012 --> 05:47.197
I said not now!

05:47.221 --> 05:49.732
Are you a loser or
just plain stupid?

05:50.975 --> 05:53.319
- I'm gonna go to school, okay?
- Yeah, you do that.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.237
You go get smart, huh?

05:58.983 --> 06:00.451
I'm sorry.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.662
If I had the cash, I'd
skip down to Mexico.

06:03.946 --> 06:06.499
Or maybe up to Canada.
The major hates Canada.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.834
I just wanna get the
hell out of here!

06:10.369 --> 06:13.130
Oh, don't worry about it.
Maybe we'll go to war soon.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.053
And plié.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.679
Turn.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.392
- Oh, sorry.
- And plié. Turn.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.361
What are we supposed to do?
Jeté into the end zone?

06:26.385 --> 06:27.696
I told you coach was twisted.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.397
Stretch that point.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.867
Ow! This one I hate.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.236
I couldn't find my shoes. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.697
Sarah! What are you doing here?

06:38.856 --> 06:42.284
Having an intense hallucination.
Sorry, but you guys?

06:42.944 --> 06:45.255
Coach's idea. After Will
tackled the water bucket.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.049
Hey, hey. You blew
that interception.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.884
Yeah, only because Pendarvis
throws like a girl!

06:48.908 --> 06:49.843
Hey!

06:49.867 --> 06:50.844
No offense.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.387
Gentlemen, no talking.

06:52.411 --> 06:53.838
All right, now
loosen the wrists.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.382
And pirouette.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.883
Oh, God.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.728
Coach said it will improve
our coordination.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.105
Oh, yeah, it's really
good for tha...

07:01.129 --> 07:02.471
Ow!

07:02.964 --> 07:04.066
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.276
That's excellent. Well,
let's pair off now.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.602
<i>Vite, vite.</i> Grab a partner.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.481
Oh, Will, you wanna...?

07:12.890 --> 07:14.525
Sure. Why not?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.613
Hands on ladies' hips.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.866
Gently.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.169
All right, ladies,
<i>entrechat quatre.</i>

07:24.193 --> 07:25.703
And...

07:32.618 --> 07:35.639
Just have a seat, Claudia. Ms.
Hutchins will get you all set up.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.214
Thanks, Ms. Bullock.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.771
So, what's her mood today?

07:42.795 --> 07:43.856
Excuse me?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.315
Principal Bulldog.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.475
She having a good day, or
is she totally ragged?

07:48.092 --> 07:50.102
She seemed pretty okay to me.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.355
What? Are you, like, in
trouble or something?

07:54.182 --> 07:55.524
Or something.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.578
I skipped three
times this month.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.829
I wouldn't have got
caught yesterday,

07:58.853 --> 08:00.706
but I had to stop off
to have a smoke,

08:00.730 --> 08:03.657
and Fat Butt Beaglemeyer
busted my ass, so...

08:04.525 --> 08:06.535
Well, it's the story
of my sucky life.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.789
What did you do? Bring a
gun in your lunch box?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.916
Oh, yeah. Twice.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.762
Actually, I just got tired of
turning pages in Orchestra,

08:15.786 --> 08:18.964
so I asked if I could do something
else till I get my cast off.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.008
I play the violin.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.982
Anyway, Ms. Bullock said I could
work in the attendance office, so...

08:27.006 --> 08:28.233
Wait.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.851
You mean, like, stamping
excuses and stuff?

08:31.552 --> 08:32.937
I guess so.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.522
I don't know.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.732
What's your name, fiddle girl?

08:37.390 --> 08:38.650
Claudia.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.068
Jody.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.738
Got a feeling we're
gonna be best friends.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.165
You really shouldn't have
done that this morning.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.084
I mean, coming over like that.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.221
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.338
It just gave him something
else to scream at me about.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.433
He's already saying
that I'm flunking out

09:01.457 --> 09:03.101
because I'm spending
all my time with you.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.521
And he's starting all
that Army crap again.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.605
Army?

09:06.629 --> 09:07.763
Jule!

09:07.838 --> 09:08.899
Have you seen Theo?

09:08.923 --> 09:11.026
Uh, yeah. He's outside, smoking.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.061
I think he's upset. He said you were
supposed to pay him first thing.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.906
Just got back from the bank.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.910
Um, here's the 20 I owe you
for the bags and stuff.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.277
Thank you.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.657
Griffin, what's going on?

09:27.900 --> 09:31.120
Oh, he says that if
I don't graduate,

09:31.237 --> 09:32.872
he's gonna make me enlist.

09:32.905 --> 09:33.924
What?

09:33.948 --> 09:35.958
He can't do that. I
mean, you're 18.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.710
This should cover it.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.006
If I don't graduate, he's just
gonna kick me out of the house.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.893
And I don't have the
cash to get a new place.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.395
I sure as hell don't have a job.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.314
Well, then, you'll just have to graduate.
And I'll help you.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.275
We'll just have to
do some studying.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.892
I mean, we can do that.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.186
Right? I mean, can't we? Hmm?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.909
See, this is what
we should be doing

10:00.933 --> 10:02.651
rather than dancing
around on our tiptoes.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.403
God, this feels good.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.041
Boy, Sarah's pretty
much a klutz, huh?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.334
The worst.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.911
Did you see her get her
foot caught on that bar?

10:12.069 --> 10:13.412
Yeah.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.008
Can I, uh, run something by you?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.583
Sure. Go ahead.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.177
Yes!

10:19.201 --> 10:23.515
I mean, since you two aren't
dating anymore, I just wondered

10:23.539 --> 10:25.309
if you'd mind if maybe...

10:25.333 --> 10:27.009
maybe I asked her out.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.262
Mind?

10:30.421 --> 10:31.972
Why would I mind?

10:32.923 --> 10:34.141
Ugh!

10:38.012 --> 10:39.573
Oh, whoa.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.440
Total muscle failure.
That's good.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.359
So, uh...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.361
so, then, about Sarah.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.655
Would that be okay?

10:48.147 --> 10:51.367
I mean, she's really great, and since
things didn't work out for you guys

10:51.400 --> 10:53.462
and I'm kind of interested,
I just thought...

10:53.486 --> 10:54.713
Hey.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.206
We're not together anymore.
You don't even need to ask.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.375
Let's do some curls.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.046
Look, Theo, calm down.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.474
Maybe your insurance
will cover it.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.851
Man, what insurance?
Put it on your claim.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.561
- It happened in your restaurant.
- I told you...

11:09.585 --> 11:11.146
Yeah, Mr. Arbogast,
I'm still here.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.314
What did the police say?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.598
You want a direct quote?
"Kiss it goodbye."

11:14.632 --> 11:16.975
So, when am I gonna get my check?
I need to get started...

11:17.051 --> 11:18.195
Yeah, I'll hold.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.030
- How much did they get?
- 1200.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.490
The whole payroll for my crew.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.158
We don't find it,
you paying me back.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.118
Hey, it's not my fault you
left your jacket on the bar.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.318
Please.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.497
Isn't there anything
else you can do?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.040
Oh, yeah. My cousin's a cop.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.291
He's gonna look into this.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.835
See if he can find the sorry
son of a bitch who did this.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.878
Did what?

11:34.902 --> 11:37.788
Somebody stole Theo's money
from the restaurant today.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.132
You're kidding.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.333
Investigation? What kind of...?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.878
Hey, this is sort of like a Nancy
Drew mystery or something.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.140
Maybe we should question
everybody who was there.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.600
No way! There's no way!

11:48.624 --> 11:51.144
It obviously wasn't Theo or us.
Who else was there?

11:51.168 --> 11:53.220
None of my guys would
have done this.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.140
Julia, did you see anybody?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.311
I don't think so.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.116
- Sorry.
- That's impossible! Why would anybody...?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.659
No, I will not ho...

12:05.683 --> 12:07.151
Hello?

12:08.227 --> 12:09.611
I don't believe this.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.780
They think the fire was arson.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.456
Arson?

12:20.865 --> 12:23.500
Man, who would do
something like that?

12:23.826 --> 12:26.336
Maybe the same guy that ripped us off.
Who knows?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.265
Must be a full
moon or something.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.592
Here you go. Green clover.
Better put it in your pocket.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.606
So did you, um...

12:36.630 --> 12:37.931
Did you call her?

12:38.382 --> 12:39.767
Who?

12:40.968 --> 12:42.853
Oh, Sarah.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.773
Actually, uh... yeah, I did.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.691
And?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.779
And, uh, we sort of went out.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.699
When?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.701
What, you mean,
like, last night?

12:58.736 --> 13:01.538
Well, you know, I called,

13:01.989 --> 13:03.425
and she had these
tickets, so, uh,

13:03.449 --> 13:05.667
we went to this thing,
and it's no big deal.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.377
A thing?

13:08.996 --> 13:10.422
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

13:12.541 --> 13:15.719
The play? The movie? What?

13:16.712 --> 13:18.430
The ballet, actually.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.308
And here's the wild part,

13:21.509 --> 13:23.236
you know the end,
when Juliet wakes up

13:23.260 --> 13:25.530
and finds Romeo dead, and
then she stabs herself

13:25.554 --> 13:27.073
and twinkles around on her toes

13:27.097 --> 13:29.034
for about a half-hour
before she goes down,

13:29.058 --> 13:32.110
arms flying, legs
flapping, everything?

13:33.437 --> 13:35.113
Sarah actually cried.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.449
Like, tears.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.454
I never realized how
into that stuff she was.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.592
It's kind of sad,

13:45.616 --> 13:47.260
somebody who wants to
be something so bad,

13:47.284 --> 13:50.921
and then they're just... so bad.

13:54.124 --> 13:57.052
Well, for the record,
I mean, I hated it.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.097
But you guys still
had a good time.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.767
Yeah, not really.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.352
It was kind of dull.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.146
You know, she's
better in a group.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.858
Oh.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.443
Well,

14:13.936 --> 14:15.487
nothing ventured, right?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.281
Right.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.952
You're not gonna believe this.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.330
Crack of dawn, I'm
sitting there, right?

14:25.447 --> 14:26.800
And I should be getting a check.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.544
And that bastard Arbogast practically
accused me of setting the fire.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.180
- Me!
- What?

14:32.204 --> 14:33.473
Wait a minute. He said that?

14:33.497 --> 14:36.091
Get this. He's been digging
through my finances.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.854
And he found out about that loan I
applied for after I took over...

14:38.878 --> 14:40.939
Wait. What loan? You
applied for a loan?

14:40.963 --> 14:43.859
Yeah. Yeah. I told you that.
We were tight making payroll.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.653
But I got turned down, and
he said that was suspicious.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.447
But I don't get it. What does
that have to do with the fire?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.448
Nothing!

14:50.472 --> 14:52.868
And then he starts going on about
how I upped the insurance,

14:52.892 --> 14:56.371
which is totally ridiculous because we
were under-insured in the first place.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.165
You upped the insurance? You
didn't tell me about that.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.084
I didn't tell you I bought
new napkins either.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.534
It was no big deal.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.880
Only he tried to make it
out like I set the fire

15:04.904 --> 15:06.622
so that I could collect
the insurance.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.083
He's just stalling because he doesn't
wanna pay me what he owes me.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.835
Well, I set him straight.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.630
Man, can you believe that guy?

15:22.838 --> 15:25.432
I looked for you at your locker
before school this morning.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.102
Oh, yeah, I was kind of late.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.700
You know, he's always
ragging me to go to school,

15:33.724 --> 15:35.734
and then I'm late because
he's yelling at me.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.363
Has he always been like this?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.531
No.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.367
Not like this.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.620
Just... Just since Jill.

15:49.823 --> 15:53.794
Griffin, do you remember yesterday
when you were at the restaurant?

15:54.870 --> 15:58.298
I was just wondering if maybe
you noticed anybody weird.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.801
Like, hanging
around or anything.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.096
- Not really. Why?
- Well,

16:05.089 --> 16:08.600
because somebody stole the
money that Charlie gave Theo.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.895
And we were just trying to figure
out who might have done that.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.398
Oh, man.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.784
That's too bad.

16:15.808 --> 16:16.868
I really wasn't...

16:16.892 --> 16:18.912
Really wasn't paying attention.

16:18.936 --> 16:19.996
Yeah, me neither.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.572
But the police are going
to look into it, so, um...

16:23.065 --> 16:25.752
You know, I like to think that
maybe the person who took it

16:25.776 --> 16:27.671
was just so desperate or
they really weren't thinking

16:27.695 --> 16:30.956
and if they realize that, then
maybe the money will show up.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.968
Yeah.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.637
Yeah, well, I hope you
guys figure it out.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.838
I got a class, you know.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.591
Yeah. I know.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.853
Oh, hey, Claudia.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.971
Wait up. I've been looking
all over for you.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.181
You have? Why?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.225
'Cause we're best
buds, remember?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.435
Cancer?

16:51.760 --> 16:55.105
No, thanks. I... I quit.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.533
You crack me up.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.692
Hey, look at what I got.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.281
Your Mom wrote you an excuse?

17:04.440 --> 17:05.666
I thought you said you skipped.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.127
Jayne Maynard did it for me.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.537
Check this out, "Grandfather's
medical difficulties."

17:10.612 --> 17:11.923
Man, she is good.

17:11.946 --> 17:12.924
Cool.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.134
Okay, so here's the plan.

17:14.157 --> 17:16.845
Tomorrow you get Ms. Hutchins to
stamp it and approve it for me

17:16.868 --> 17:18.137
before it goes back to Bullock.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.682
This way she'll think
Hutchins called my Mom.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.933
Rocks, huh?

17:21.957 --> 17:23.393
I can't do that, Jody.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.053
Sure you can. You're right
there in the office and...

17:28.756 --> 17:30.025
You know, I'd do it for you.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.850
I said I can't, okay?

17:33.677 --> 17:35.113
Look, I gotta go.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.731
Man, good thing I'm not
bleeding to death.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.858
Here you go.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.611
Thanks.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.500
Will! No!

17:47.524 --> 17:49.044
- I swear.
- No.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.795
She did not look like
a spastic penguin.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.339
Spastic penguin... Come
on, who dies like that?

17:53.363 --> 17:55.624
Huh? She was like...

18:01.038 --> 18:02.381
Not even close.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.800
You're cute.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.937
What are they doing
in there, anyway?

18:17.846 --> 18:19.731
Planting evidence, with my luck.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.818
Finally.

18:22.893 --> 18:23.953
Mr. Salinger.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.696
Yeah. Can we please
get on with this now?

18:26.772 --> 18:27.989
I'm afraid not.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.827
The fire marshal was wrong. It
wasn't a short in the outlet.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.496
Well, what was it?

18:34.988 --> 18:37.582
Somebody left your
coffee machine on.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.128
And, um, you were
the last one here.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.005
Well, it was, uh...

18:44.456 --> 18:46.184
It was 3 o'clock in the morning.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.717
I mean, I guess I just

18:48.752 --> 18:49.813
forgot.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.930
But that proves it
was an accident.

18:52.548 --> 18:56.393
You don't intentionally burn down a
building by leaving a coffeepot on.

18:56.510 --> 19:00.147
Well, you do if you shove a box of
paper up next to the heating element.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.190
Paper?

19:03.100 --> 19:06.037
That was a box of menus. That
does not prove anything.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.279
Except...

19:08.522 --> 19:10.490
you shut off the water valve.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.669
What?

19:12.693 --> 19:15.964
You didn't shut off the machine,
but you shut off the water valve

19:15.988 --> 19:20.093
so that there was no water in
the urn to absorb the heat

19:20.117 --> 19:21.261
when you left the burner on.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.096
No, I can explain that. That...

19:23.120 --> 19:24.463
That's my fault.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.810
I helped Charlie close up.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.636
And he showed me how to
clean the coffee urn.

19:31.795 --> 19:32.939
But I...

19:32.963 --> 19:35.066
I guess I must have forgot
to turn the water back on.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.475
And then I...

19:36.717 --> 19:39.769
I went home before Charlie
did, so he didn't know.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.866
I feel so stupid!

19:42.890 --> 19:45.859
Hey. I mean, you didn't know.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.404
You didn't know.

19:51.398 --> 19:54.627
It's only $600, and I know that's not
enough, but I can get some more.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.713
- I mean, whatever it takes.
- Gotta get out of here, Julia.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.839
I know you need to get away.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.081
I mean, I know how hard
it is for you here.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.801
You're just gonna
make things worse.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.845
And then maybe Theo's
money can just show up,

20:03.869 --> 20:05.180
and no one will
have to find out.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.546
Griffin!

20:07.706 --> 20:09.007
You gotta go.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.060
I mean it, Julia. Get
out of here now!

20:11.084 --> 20:12.729
What the hell did you do now?

20:12.753 --> 20:15.315
Whoa. Nobody said
he did anything.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.357
Okay, please.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.141
I just wanna ask
a few questions.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.322
Griffin, I'm investigating
the theft of some money

20:22.346 --> 20:24.731
from Salinger's Restaurant
over on Filbert.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.317
Now, you were there
yesterday afternoon, right?

20:27.559 --> 20:28.786
Yeah, sure.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.165
That's my family's place. He
just came by to help clean up.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.782
You know anything about this?

20:34.358 --> 20:35.700
Do you?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.795
Major Holbrook, would you
step into the other room?

20:37.819 --> 20:39.329
Are you that stupid?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.548
Don't call me stupid!

20:40.572 --> 20:43.176
Whoa! Hey! Everybody's
okay here, all right?

20:43.200 --> 20:45.053
- Now, major, please.
- How stupid are you, son?

20:45.077 --> 20:48.973
I mean, are you stupid enough to throw away
your whole life over a handful of cash?

20:48.997 --> 20:50.674
Major Holbrook...

20:56.588 --> 20:58.682
Does that answer your
question, major?

21:03.387 --> 21:05.689
Well, that was easy enough.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.441
Put your hands on
your head, please.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.781
Griffin Holbrook, you're under
arrest for grand theft.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.950
You have the right
to remain silent.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.994
You also have the
right to an attorney.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.289
If you can't afford one, one
will be appointed to you.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.009
Should you choose to
give up that right,

21:25.033 --> 21:28.503
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

21:32.291 --> 21:37.188
Okay, I've got rent receipts for the past
10 years and some old fondue recipes.

21:37.212 --> 21:40.098
Insurance papers, Claud.
Keep digging.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.767
He wants all this stuff
in his office by 8:30.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.779
I've got nothing else
to say to you, Jule.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.739
Look, I know you're mad, okay.
I get that.

21:46.763 --> 21:47.949
No, obviously you don't.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.367
'Cause "mad" doesn't
even come close.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.660
Will you just listen?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.870
I talked to the lawyer
assigned to Griffin's case.

21:52.894 --> 21:56.489
- I am busy here! - He said the whole thing
will go away if Theo drops the charges.

21:56.940 --> 21:57.834
Really?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.168
Well, he's not gonna do that.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.994
He will if you talk to him.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.131
I mean, if you explain that
Griffin made a mistake...

22:03.155 --> 22:04.090
A mistake?

22:04.114 --> 22:05.383
Julia, he stole.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.042
Charlie, please.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.761
You don't know what's going on.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.596
You don't know how
horrible it is for him.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.297
I don't care, okay?

22:12.539 --> 22:15.550
Julia, get a clue here.
The guy is a loser!

22:18.128 --> 22:20.648
His Dad let him spend
the night in jail.

22:20.672 --> 22:21.973
Did you know that?

22:22.174 --> 22:23.985
He wouldn't even come down
to the police station,

22:24.009 --> 22:25.894
and he won't pay for
a decent lawyer.

22:27.971 --> 22:30.857
You should see how his
Dad talks to him.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.870
I mean, the way he treats him. If you
saw that, maybe you'd understand and...

22:33.894 --> 22:35.403
And what?

22:35.854 --> 22:38.207
I'd feel sorry for him,
forget about what he did?

22:38.231 --> 22:39.959
God, Charlie, he
could go to prison!

22:39.983 --> 22:41.910
Yeah, well, you know what?
So could I!

22:42.027 --> 22:43.703
And I didn't do anything.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.466
Hey, Will.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.427
Man, I think I pulled a
groin muscle or something.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.554
You didn't call me back.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.932
- What?
- Last night.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.401
You never called me back.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.695
Oh, uh, I was out kind of late.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.396
I had this family thing.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.023
I can't believe you.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.995
- What?
- You're lying to me!

23:16.019 --> 23:18.822
No, really. My...

23:18.980 --> 23:20.990
My sister had this pageant

23:21.024 --> 23:24.170
at her school, about the
four basic food groups.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.546
Penny was a cantaloupe.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.964
- Should've seen it.
- Come on!

23:26.988 --> 23:29.833
Will, come on. I saw you and
Sarah together yesterday, okay?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.094
And you didn't look
like two people

23:31.118 --> 23:34.055
who just had a date that was...
kind of dull.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.557
And if you did, you wouldn't
have gone out again last night,

23:36.581 --> 23:38.935
which I know you did,
because Dana just told me.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.396
And... And a cantaloupe?
Your sister's 13!

23:42.420 --> 23:44.107
I didn't wanna upset
you, that's all.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.399
Upset me? I'm not upset!

23:45.423 --> 23:46.400
Then why are you so upset?

23:46.424 --> 23:47.934
I'm upset because
you lied to me.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.737
I don't care if you date Sarah.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.313
I told you that. Just don't
go around lying about it.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.575
So you're not upset...
about me and Sarah?

23:54.599 --> 23:56.651
No. No, I am not.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.821
'Cause you can sort of understand
why I think you'd be upset.

24:00.856 --> 24:01.874
I'm not upset.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.032
Okay.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.869
Sarah said you wouldn't be.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.922
Well, see? She's right.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.330
And...

24:12.117 --> 24:13.418
She said that?

24:13.743 --> 24:16.546
Yeah. She said it
wouldn't be a problem.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.715
Well,

24:20.041 --> 24:21.468
there you go.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.601
Hey!

24:30.093 --> 24:31.362
A little privacy?

24:31.386 --> 24:32.905
You scared me.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.147
What are you doing?

24:34.639 --> 24:36.242
I'm writing a book report.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.443
You're just gonna get
in trouble again.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.996
Yeah?

24:40.020 --> 24:41.529
Why do you care?

24:41.688 --> 24:42.832
I don't.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.950
Good, then you won't
care about this.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.630
Oh, yeah.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.008
Now I'm just gonna have to
shoot myself in the head.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.875
You didn't even spell it right.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.253
It's an abbreviation. Duh.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.173
Not that. Duh.

25:00.415 --> 25:01.674
"Fiddle."

25:02.334 --> 25:04.219
It's L-E.

25:06.504 --> 25:07.889
Not E-L.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.767
Claudia?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.862
Uh... Ms. Bullock.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.405
Man, this is fresh.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.781
Relax, Ms. Bull.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.491
She just took my
pen away from me.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.785
I think I'm under citizen's
arrest or something.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.120
Thank you, Claudia.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.196
You, come with me.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.573
Yeah. Thanks a gazillion.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.286
Bail is denied.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.205
Next case.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.551
Now, gentlemen, on this
outstanding matter,

25:35.575 --> 25:37.178
I suggest you get your
paperwork in order

25:37.202 --> 25:39.045
and take this up with
the court clerk.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.016
Just reschedule and
let's try again, okay?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.258
Thank you.

25:44.834 --> 25:49.774
Next case on the docket
is case number CL8952468.

25:49.798 --> 25:53.309
<i>People vs Griffin
Chase Holbrook.</i>

25:53.718 --> 25:57.105
The charge is grand theft.
How do you plead?

25:58.056 --> 25:59.659
Guilty. I guess.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.161
The people request bail
in the amount of $20,000.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.079
Come on!

26:03.103 --> 26:05.706
Your Honor, Mr. Holbrook's an
18-year-old first offender

26:05.730 --> 26:09.669
who lives with his father, a Major Chase W.
Holbrook of the U.S. Army.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.922
He stole the $1200 because he was
planning to run away, Judge.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.415
Releasing him now
poses a flight risk.

26:15.615 --> 26:18.751
Fine. Bail is set at
$20,000, cash or bond.

26:19.911 --> 26:24.850
Case number CL985463, <i>People
vs Emery Carter Dillon.</i>

26:24.874 --> 26:27.144
The charge is aggravated
assault and resisting arrest.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.145
How does the defendant plead?

26:28.169 --> 26:29.105
Griffin.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.648
We enter a plea of not
guilty, Your Honor.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.566
The people request bail
in the amount of $10,000.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.193
Your Honor, this is crazy.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.103
He has no aggression,
which means he poses...

26:38.930 --> 26:40.189
Oh.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.321
I thought you were gonna call me
after you spoke to the lawyer.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.073
Not much point.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.075
It's not like I had
any good news.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.289
So I guess I should thank
you for covering for me.

26:58.575 --> 27:02.337
I... I didn't know
what else to do.

27:03.955 --> 27:08.343
Man, I'm glad you came up with that
whole "cleanin the coffee urn" thing.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.231
That was the one part of the plan
I didn't think I could explain

27:12.255 --> 27:13.806
if they ever found it.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.185
I didn't think they'd believe
that I forgot that too.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.563
So that... that was good.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.523
You really helped me out.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.150
Charlie...

27:25.602 --> 27:27.487
You think that's what happened?

27:28.104 --> 27:29.280
I...

27:30.190 --> 27:31.250
I don't know.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.285
'Cause that's the only reason that I can
think of for why you would lie for me.

27:35.278 --> 27:38.414
I mean, why else would you do that unless
part of you thinks that I'm guilty?

27:49.876 --> 27:51.761
Nice shot, Floyd.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.138
It was the chalk, Irma.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.265
What? I swear.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.767
I'm gonna get some more.

28:00.637 --> 28:01.896
Floyd?

28:02.097 --> 28:03.523
Irma?

28:03.807 --> 28:07.402
Yeah. We kind of came up with pool-hall
names for each other last night.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.195
Kind of silly.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.791
God, he is such a great
guy, you know that?

28:11.815 --> 28:14.117
I mean, I can totally see
why he's your best friend.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.872
So is this weird, or what?

28:21.032 --> 28:23.042
I don't know. Do you think so?

28:24.285 --> 28:25.304
Maybe a little.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.889
But, you know, I'm really
glad that you're okay

28:26.913 --> 28:28.798
with all of us hanging
out together.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.768
It's kind of funny
how things turn out,

28:30.792 --> 28:32.593
but I guess it's for
the best, right?

28:35.296 --> 28:36.723
You wanna break, Bay?

28:37.132 --> 28:39.443
Uh, I think I wanna go last.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.861
Show you guys how it's done.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.395
Oh, I will.

28:44.180 --> 28:47.108
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't wanna
have to pay for the felt.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.486
Now, what you wanna
do is you want to...

28:50.687 --> 28:51.580
In the middle?

28:51.604 --> 28:52.581
Hold this hand up like that.

28:52.605 --> 28:53.906
Like that. Okay.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.961
- Right in the middle.
- In the middle.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.328
Okay, wanna put money
on this one, Salinger?

29:10.165 --> 29:11.466
Major Holbrook?

29:12.542 --> 29:13.968
He's not here.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.679
I know, um,

29:17.005 --> 29:18.639
I came to see you.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.439
You weren't at the
arraignment today.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.369
And Griffin's lawyer
thinks that it might help

29:30.393 --> 29:32.862
if you come down tomorrow
for the sentencing.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.959
He thinks he might be
able to figure out a way

29:36.983 --> 29:38.836
so that Griffin doesn't
have to go to prison.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.578
Look, um...

29:43.698 --> 29:45.333
Why don't you go home, okay?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.668
What... is it Julie?

29:47.744 --> 29:49.962
I don't feel like talking
to anybody right now.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.976
I know.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.969
- Believe me, I know.
- No, excuse me.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.138
You don't know.

30:01.007 --> 30:04.435
Has Griffin ever told
you much about me?

30:05.929 --> 30:09.148
Probably not, huh? I mean,
you don't even know my name.

30:11.935 --> 30:15.696
Major Holbrook, my parents
were killed two years ago.

30:17.690 --> 30:20.785
So I know what it's like to
lose people that you love.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.965
And I know what it's like to get
mad about things that just happen.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.250
I mean, I said, "To hell
with everything," you know,

30:27.784 --> 30:29.585
for a long time after.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.593
I think we're probably
a lot alike that way.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.065
Please...

30:41.089 --> 30:45.236
But I realize that being mad
doesn't make anything better,

30:45.260 --> 30:49.188
and it doesn't change anything, and there
are still people around that matter.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.697
You lost your daughter

31:00.358 --> 31:03.077
and there's nothing you
can do about that.

31:06.197 --> 31:10.835
But now you might lose your son.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.191
Are you gonna see Griffin today?

31:33.641 --> 31:35.193
If they let me.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.406
So he could go to jail, huh?

31:40.857 --> 31:42.408
I hope not.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.911
Maybe.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.673
I really don't get it, Jule.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.917
I mean, why would he do this?

31:52.619 --> 31:54.503
Why would he steal from us?

31:57.290 --> 31:58.507
I don't know.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.010
But doesn't it make you mad?

32:02.420 --> 32:04.648
Why aren't you mad at him, Julia?
I'm mad at him.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.098
I don't know.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.184
I'm not sure.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.033
Sometimes people
do stupid things.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.775
You know, like,

32:16.392 --> 32:18.621
when they feel really
bad about themselves,

32:18.645 --> 32:20.196
and you just...

32:20.647 --> 32:23.032
You have to try and understand.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.994
Okay.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.832
There's no way I
can go with you.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.544
Right?

32:39.916 --> 32:41.300
I'm sorry.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.266
Mr. Arbogast.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.320
You shouldn't be here, Mr.
Salinger.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.237
Do you have any idea

32:52.261 --> 32:54.615
how much your company's made off
Salinger's in the past 15 years?

32:54.639 --> 32:56.274
This is highly inappropriate.

32:56.891 --> 32:59.536
Ninety-seven thousand, six
hundred and forty-one dollars

32:59.560 --> 33:00.955
and twelve cents, for insurance.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.083
I should not be talking to you
without a lawyer present, please.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.918
Only that doesn't mean anything,

33:05.942 --> 33:08.369
even though we've never
filed a claim, not once.

33:08.403 --> 33:12.049
And now, now that we need it, now that we're
entitled to half of what we paid you,

33:12.073 --> 33:14.635
you bend over backwards to find some
way to make sure we don't get it.

33:14.659 --> 33:18.254
We don't pay when circumstances
are suspect, now please leave.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.016
I used to have people who trusted
me, and now they don't anymore

33:21.040 --> 33:23.560
because you accused me of
something that I didn't do.

33:23.584 --> 33:26.012
And you've got nothing
to back that up.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.690
But why should you give
a damn about that?

33:27.714 --> 33:30.474
Just as long as you can save
your company a few more dollars.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.274
I just want you to
know something.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.403
That restaurant was my father's.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.573
And that doesn't mean anything
to you, and you don't care,

33:46.274 --> 33:48.460
but if you had any idea
how much it means to me,

33:48.484 --> 33:51.005
how it is the only thing
that I have left of him,

33:51.029 --> 33:54.415
there is no way that you would
accuse me of burning it down.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.378
There's no way.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.343
Hey, Claudia.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.970
Give me a hand with this.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.514
I've only got one.

34:14.092 --> 34:15.226
Guess what.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.397
I actually had a
Bullock-free day,

34:18.723 --> 34:20.451
so I'm guessing this means
someone in the office

34:20.475 --> 34:22.275
must have done me a
favor or something.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.819
Doubt it.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.780
Who would do that for you?

34:26.105 --> 34:29.199
I don't know. Some
geek, probably.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.743
Yeah.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.453
Probably.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.830
Hey, I wanna sign your cast.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.123
Or is it only for
people you like?

34:37.408 --> 34:39.335
I guess I can make an exception.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.800
There. Check it out.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.562
At least you spelled
it right this time.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.304
Yeah, well, who wants to see
your little head explode again?

34:53.341 --> 34:54.318
Jerk.

34:54.342 --> 34:55.559
Freak.

34:56.302 --> 34:57.895
You're gonna smoke on the bus?

34:58.054 --> 35:00.022
Hey, I'm jonesin', okay?

35:00.139 --> 35:02.108
Man, we gotta loosen you up.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.903
Come on, fiddle girl.
Walk on the wild side.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.315
Are you...

35:44.058 --> 35:45.526
Are you okay?

35:45.893 --> 35:47.287
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.737
I don't know.

35:51.190 --> 35:55.119
Uh, they're letting me out
of here this afternoon.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.089
They are?

35:57.113 --> 35:58.747
Yeah, out of here, anyway.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.292
Yeah, my, uh...

36:02.869 --> 36:05.963
My Dad showed up this
morning with, uh,

36:06.497 --> 36:08.215
some big Army lawyer.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.553
Said he wanted to get things
back on the right track.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.806
It was kind of weird.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.725
Anyway, uh...

36:18.301 --> 36:23.230
he called in a favor,
and they worked it out.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.649
I'm not going to prison.

36:27.226 --> 36:29.913
You mean, like,
probation or something?

36:29.937 --> 36:32.656
Well, um, I'm

36:34.817 --> 36:38.954
going away to the Allenwood
Academy for six months.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.916
It's, like, this military
school in Louisiana.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.836
I guess it could be worse.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.302
Griffin, can you

36:53.544 --> 36:55.554
at least tell me why you did it?

36:56.380 --> 36:57.890
'Cause, um,

36:58.716 --> 37:01.570
I'm gonna need to know so that I
can figure all this out after.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.062
I don't know.

37:04.972 --> 37:08.150
I... just figured I...

37:08.726 --> 37:10.945
If I could do
something like this,

37:11.479 --> 37:13.280
maybe I could just split.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.785
Or maybe the army wouldn't
take me, you know?

37:19.779 --> 37:23.832
Maybe I just got so used
to him calling me stupid

37:25.910 --> 37:29.505
that I just felt that I
had to prove him right.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.472
Sorry, we're closed.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.143
Too bad. I hear you're
famous for your coffee.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.570
You got a check?

37:53.813 --> 37:55.114
Yeah.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.450
But only because they
can't prove anything.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.953
It's half of what I should get,

38:01.195 --> 38:03.247
but it'll cover the repairs,

38:03.572 --> 38:05.457
so I guess I got away with it.

38:05.491 --> 38:08.085
Charlie Salinger,
professional arsonist.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.383
I bought you a little present.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.636
I thought it might come in handy
for your new line of work.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.655
I mean, I don't
know what it means

38:26.679 --> 38:29.857
or what it says about
me, or you, or us.

38:32.101 --> 38:35.446
But I had this revelation,
in three parts.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.374
Three parts?

38:37.398 --> 38:38.782
Bear with me.

38:39.942 --> 38:41.243
A.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.755
Okay, a part of me, I admit it,

38:43.779 --> 38:45.215
thought for a minute you
might have done it,

38:45.239 --> 38:46.883
even though I know you didn't,

38:46.907 --> 38:49.011
and... and I know
that that's absurd,

38:49.035 --> 38:52.921
but it didn't take long for
me to get to B, which is,

38:53.873 --> 38:55.758
I realized I didn't care.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.428
It just... It didn't
matter to me.

38:59.795 --> 39:02.556
And that's great. That's
probably the way it should be.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.435
You're not gonna start singing
"Stand By Your Man," I hope.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.437
No.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.240
But if you wanna rob a
liquor store or something

39:10.264 --> 39:12.900
and you need somebody to keep the
car running, now's your chance.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.449
So, what happened to C?

39:20.733 --> 39:22.117
Well, C is just...

39:23.402 --> 39:28.123
I never knew being crazy about
somebody means exactly that.

39:28.324 --> 39:31.001
It means you're crazy.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.901
I've never done it in a
burned-out restaurant before.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.309
Have you?

39:50.304 --> 39:53.273
Once, actually, but that
was a long time ago.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.711
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.078
What are you doing?

40:10.282 --> 40:11.458
Oh.

40:13.077 --> 40:16.098
Listen, I, uh...

40:16.122 --> 40:17.715
I kind of have to talk to you.

40:18.290 --> 40:19.508
What's up?

40:19.834 --> 40:22.646
Well, I don't know, uh,

40:22.670 --> 40:25.774
It's kind of weird, and I don't
really know exactly how to say this,

40:25.798 --> 40:27.150
but I really have to.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.893
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.613
Isn't she great?

40:41.730 --> 40:43.449
I mean, isn't she just...?

40:49.238 --> 40:50.748
Yeah, she is.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.835
So, what was it you
wanted to say?

40:58.581 --> 41:00.591
Just, uh...

41:02.084 --> 41:04.479
I mean, I need to
get those, uh...

41:04.503 --> 41:08.390
Those physics notes back
from you one of these days.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.560
Sure. No problem.

41:20.519 --> 41:21.779
Okay.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.297
Griffin?

41:42.708 --> 41:44.718
We've got a few minutes.
I'll wait in the car.

41:53.219 --> 41:54.895
Were you gonna call me?

41:58.057 --> 42:00.150
I didn't know if you'd
wanna hear from me or not.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.737
How can you say that? I mean,

42:05.022 --> 42:07.157
how can you even think that?

42:08.943 --> 42:10.369
I just do.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.247
Griffin.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.473
You know what?

42:21.497 --> 42:22.965
You know, uh,

42:25.042 --> 42:26.718
you probably shouldn't write me.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.638
Well, 'cause, uh...

42:30.631 --> 42:32.391
'Cause I probably
won't write back.

42:34.134 --> 42:37.312
You kind of... You kind
of need to know that.

42:41.517 --> 42:45.070
Just... Just forget
about me, okay, Julia?

42:45.104 --> 42:46.540
Stop it, Griffin, don't...

42:46.564 --> 42:48.031
No, look at you.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.200
And look at me.

42:53.487 --> 42:54.955
I don't know.

42:56.365 --> 42:59.167
Sometimes I still can't
believe that you were mine.

43:02.329 --> 43:04.006
Even for a little while.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.352
I got... I gotta go.

43:22.516 --> 43:23.984
Oh, yeah.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.071
I love you.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.490
Okay?

43:34.069 --> 43:35.579
