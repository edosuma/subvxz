00:27.328 --> 00:28.727
That's right, 'cause this

00:41.142 --> 00:42.875
Nigga, ooh, no. No, no, no.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.544

These ain't strangers.

Hey, why only Fish?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.040
Because he's sexy.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.742
Fat niggas make people want
to stop eating.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.845
Mama, why you always
got to hurt my feelings

01:19.847 --> 01:21.780
in front of my friends?

01:52.212 --> 01:54.580
See, now, I have to keep
the list real tight,

01:54.582 --> 01:55.881
because technically,

01:55.883 --> 01:57.483
what I'm doing is not legal.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.918
You saying it's illegal
to serve food in your own house?

01:59.920 --> 02:03.555
No, I'm saying it's illegal to
<i>sell</i> food in your own house.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.324
So, look,
what I need you to do

02:05.326 --> 02:08.227
Mm-hmm.

check on everybody.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.395
Just make sure they happy, okay?

02:10.397 --> 02:12.264
All right.
Okay. But should I
get dressed first?

02:12.266 --> 02:15.634
No, no, I like going with that,
uh, hood theme.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.735

02:16.737 --> 02:17.836
All right, cool.
Okay.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.738
Go on and get yourself
something to eat.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.939
All right.
All right.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.007
Thank you, Ms. Tudi.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.408
Go on, baby.

02:31.751 --> 02:34.586
Boonie, if there wasn't no food
in there five minutes ago, man,

02:34.588 --> 02:36.455
it just ain't gonna appear.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.856
Really?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.825
I thought that was the point

02:39.827 --> 02:41.360
of his holiness right here.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.529
Hey, man, why don't you
make about five hot dogs

02:43.531 --> 02:46.765
and five 40s appear so you
can feed the crew tonight?

02:46.767 --> 02:48.300
What's up, man?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.801
JESUS:
Look, man, God ain't gonna solve

02:49.803 --> 02:51.436
all our problems.
If we ain't eating,

02:51.438 --> 02:53.705
that means we ain't hustling
hard enough.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.175
Ooh, nigga.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.510
Well, if it ain't
this selfish (bleep).

02:58.512 --> 03:00.479
Boonie, boy, your mom can
cook her ass off, for real.

03:00.481 --> 03:04.316
I hope you ate good, 'cause
there ain't shit to eat now.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.884
At least we got each other.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.953
FISH:
That's why we ain't
got no food now.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.521
'Cause all we got is each other.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.657
Man, this is exactly
what food stamps is for.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.458
All right, guys, listen,
I just Googled

03:13.460 --> 03:16.161

and it's really quite simple.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.696
You guys all meet the criteria.

03:17.698 --> 03:21.166
No money, no job and no income
in the bank, so.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.035
Boonie, why don't you go
down there, man?

03:23.037 --> 03:25.170
You got two kids;
they'll probably give you extra.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.905
Man, I'm already
on food stamps, man.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.473
Between my mom and Shalinka,

03:28.475 --> 03:30.809
I don't have enough left
to buy a bag of Doritos.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.178
Well, somebody gonna have
to go down there, man,

03:33.180 --> 03:34.513

Who stole the damn truck?

08:52.366 --> 08:53.965
It was...

08:53.967 --> 08:55.800
Hey, my mama
stole your truck, Jesus.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.271
Why you let her?

09:02.074 --> 09:03.475
JESUS:
<i>You wanted to talk</i>
<i>to us, Ms. Tudi?</i>

09:03.477 --> 09:05.977
I'm glad you
got my message.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.513
Because Ms. Tudi's feelings

09:08.515 --> 09:10.181
was very, very hurt.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.551
I mean, I thought
we were a team.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.419
Crew love.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.987
Huh?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.923
Crew love!

09:17.925 --> 09:21.660
But I see Ms. Tudi
just out in the cold.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.228
Now, I know something going on.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.530
I don't know what,

09:25.532 --> 09:27.332
but something is going on.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.667
I know, because this nigga

09:28.669 --> 09:31.169
right here is fatter
than he was last week.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.505
We just helping out
the less fortunate, Ms. Tudi.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.540
Y'all niggas are
the less fortunate.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.208
Now, I saw all that food.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.510
Where'd you get it?

09:38.512 --> 09:40.011
Did you steal it?

09:40.013 --> 09:41.413
Huh?

09:41.415 --> 09:44.416
Ms. Tudi, we got a little hookup
down at the SNAP office.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.451
And I got this.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.286
A EBT card?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.589
Nah, an infinite EBT card.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.190
Limitless.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.592
Jesus...

09:53.594 --> 09:55.026
is that a miracle?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.195
Huh?
That ain't no miracle,
Ms. Tudi.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.398
See, Fish,
he taking advantage of, uh,

10:00.400 --> 10:01.900
of a girl,
the way she's built,

10:01.902 --> 10:04.069
you know, when she stand up,
her ankles disappear.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.403
Laverne,
down at the SNAP office.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.571
So Fish putting
it up in her,

10:06.573 --> 10:08.073
you know what I'm saying?

10:08.075 --> 10:09.808
As long as he keep
feeding her guts,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.710
she keep feeding us.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.311
That's what's up.
Fish, I'm...

10:13.313 --> 10:15.280
surprised.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.549
(sighs)
You know what?

10:17.551 --> 10:19.918
Why don't y'all come
on and have a seat?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.287
Come on!
Y'all want some wine?

10:22.289 --> 10:23.655
Huh?
Me, too?

10:23.657 --> 10:25.624
You, too, baby.
Come on in, sit down.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.492
Wine?
Yes, some wine.
Red wine.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.094
Boonie, go get
the wine for 'em.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.495
Ms. Tudi,
why every time we try

10:30.497 --> 10:31.830
to do something good
for mankind,

10:31.832 --> 10:33.398
you gotta turn it
into a money hustle?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.666
Come on, now,
that food

10:34.668 --> 10:35.800
is for the poor
and unfortunate, man.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.068
Why you got
to act greedy

10:37.070 --> 10:38.236
all the time?

10:38.238 --> 10:39.504
Greedy?

10:39.506 --> 10:41.172
Jesus, you the one
that's being greedy.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.407
Why does everything

10:42.409 --> 10:43.808
have to be for the poor, huh?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.276
I mean, what,
you don't think

10:45.278 --> 10:46.678
we want to do shit?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.013
(phone chimes)
Now listen,

10:48.015 --> 10:50.582
your soup kitchen
is the perfect place

10:50.584 --> 10:51.916
for Tasty Tudi's.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.418
And with all
this free food,

10:53.420 --> 10:55.186
do you know how much money
we could make?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.322
Hey, trust me.
That food ain't free.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.824
Do you know what this dude
gotta do for that card?

10:59.826 --> 11:02.460
And I want to cut all y'all in.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.796
$80 a plate.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.131
Yeah, but Ms. Tudi,
who gonna pay that much

11:06.133 --> 11:07.766
to eat dinner in
a (bleep) neighborhood?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.167
(chuckles)
Baby,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.969
like I told Fish,
these white folks--

11:10.971 --> 11:12.704
ha!-- they love this shit.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.039
And see, I'm thinking

11:14.041 --> 11:16.107
we'll keep the whole
soup kitchen theme.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.443
We could even dress up
the waiters like bums.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.711
And then we could do

11:19.713 --> 11:20.945
some spontaneous
ghetto theater, you know?

11:20.947 --> 11:23.181
Like the Medieval Times?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.116
You know what?
It ain't my body.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.284
That's on y'all.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.786
But mark my words, man,

11:27.788 --> 11:29.187
if Pops don't like
y'all get down,

11:29.189 --> 11:31.122
trust and believe he gonna
shut that shit down

11:31.124 --> 11:32.957
with quickness and it
will not be fruitful.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.793
Now, Ms. Tudi,
with all due respect,

11:34.795 --> 11:36.661
may I please
have my keys

11:36.663 --> 11:38.196
so I can shake
this spot?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.365
So mad about?

11:41.400 --> 11:42.867
I don't even know why

11:42.869 --> 11:44.869
I walk this (bleep) earth
sometimes, man.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.404
Don't nobody listen.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.739
Who the (bleep) am I?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.140
Son of the Most High.

11:49.142 --> 11:52.510

11:56.416 --> 11:57.749

12:03.422 --> 12:06.424
Eh, eh, eh. Fish.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.532
Look here.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.167
How much sleep you getting, huh?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.335
No, better yet,

12:17.337 --> 12:20.705
how many nights are
you spending at Laverne's?

12:20.707 --> 12:22.907
Before you made
this little arrangement,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.375
did you negotiate

12:24.377 --> 12:26.778
how many little appointments
you were gonna have?

12:26.780 --> 12:29.114
Did you set
any rules at all?

12:29.116 --> 12:31.282
See, there you go with that
pimpin' shit again, Ms. Tudi.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.051
Look, man, I don't
really need you...

12:33.053 --> 12:34.619
Oh!

12:34.621 --> 12:37.188
What, she blowing up
your personal phone?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.557
See, that bitch thinks
she owns you.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.926
And that's
because you failed

12:41.928 --> 12:43.695
to lay out
any boundaries

12:43.697 --> 12:45.263
and any expectations.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.700
That's what good representation
can do for you.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.235
Yeah, you right, Ms. Tudi.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.270
Man, she expect a lot
for that food she givin' us.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.607
Listen, I can help you
manage this situation.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.376

is keep her happy.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.748
This place is amazing.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.519

20:01.968 --> 20:03.534

(customer exclaiming)

20:10.842 --> 20:12.577
(glass shattering)

20:13.312 --> 20:15.646
(customers gasping)

20:15.648 --> 20:16.981

20:28.161 --> 20:29.994
Let me tell you something.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.833

20:35.835 --> 20:37.868
This is a fine, (bleep)
dining establishment.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.371
And as for that little
arrangement you and Fish have?

20:40.373 --> 20:42.773
Oh.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.901

of applause to Fish!

21:14.873 --> 21:17.041

21:17.043 --> 21:19.243
Come on, Laverne,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.489
WOMAN: Oh, gross.
MAN: I'm going to throw up.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.825
Hey, Mama, is there supposed

21:34.827 --> 21:35.893
MAN:
Gross!

21:35.895 --> 21:38.296
Is this part of the theme
or what?!

21:40.899 --> 21:42.466
MAN:
<i>So disgusting.</i>
