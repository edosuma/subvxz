It's okay.
He's a in a chipmunk cave.

10:10.953 --> 10:12.753
It's nice.

10:12.755 --> 10:14.154
See?

10:14.156 --> 10:16.990
Aww.
Did Bun Bun draw that?

10:17.959 --> 10:19.126
No.

10:19.128 --> 10:20.594
[ Sighs ]

10:20.596 --> 10:22.629
We can't just let him
run around though, right?

10:22.631 --> 10:24.765
How do we know he won't moidle
all those chipmunks?

10:24.767 --> 10:26.867
No, he always did
like animals.

10:26.869 --> 10:28.869
I wonder
if a new environment

10:28.871 --> 10:31.772
might help bring out
that softer side of him.

10:31.774 --> 10:34.174
Being stuck in a lamp
sure won't do it.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.743
Let's leave him be.

10:41.616 --> 10:44.685
Bun Bun: "Dear Cinnamon Bun,
I have a dog now.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.953
His name is Cinnamon Bun.

10:46.955 --> 10:48.955
Love, Bun Bun."

10:51.225 --> 10:55.195
Come along with me

10:55.197 --> 10:59.766
And the butterflies and bees

11:01.402 --> 11:04.104
This party is so crazy!
