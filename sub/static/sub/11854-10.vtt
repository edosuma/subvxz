WEBVTT

00:06.500 --> 00:08.792
What do you say, Dorothy,
should I double down?

00:08.875 --> 00:11.750
You're showing a four,
the book says no, but hey.

00:11.834 --> 00:14.500
- You're hot.
- Me or the cards?

00:14.583 --> 00:17.041
Both.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.500
Nice playing!

00:41.166 --> 00:43.083
Nice flirting with you, Dorothy.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.542
You should never quit
after a win.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.709
I got a feeling
my luck's run out.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.166
You waste your money
on the daily numbers?

01:42.250 --> 01:43.166
Every mornin'.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.542
Five bucks
down the
drain.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.542
I don't got dependents.
I can afford it.

01:46.625 --> 01:47.792
So if you won big,
you'd retire?

01:47.875 --> 01:50.458
Nah, I'd stay doing
what I do.

01:50.542 --> 01:54.667
I'd just, uh, dress sharper
if that's possible

01:54.750 --> 01:55.667
and brag a lot more.

01:55.750 --> 01:56.959
that's

01:57.041 --> 01:59.667
Lil, you want to
take a look at this?

01:59.750 --> 02:01.000
What is it?

02:01.083 --> 02:03.417
Regional broadcast
from Delaware State Police.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.041
They just got a murder
similar to a cold job in
Jersey.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.625
Young white male,
walked into the woods

02:07.709 --> 02:08.709
shot once in the chest.

02:08.792 --> 02:09.834
Both were hitchhikers.

02:09.917 --> 02:11.542
- Motive?
- Straight robbery.

02:11.625 --> 02:14.375
Bullet in both
cases was .38 caliber.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.750
"Requesting information
on any like murders.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.250
solved or unsolved,
in the region."

02:18.333 --> 02:19.625
What, they think they
got a serial murder?

02:19.709 --> 02:20.750
- 'Sounds like it.'
- Nice.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.000
I'll check the H-records.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.542
We had a job like that.

02:24.625 --> 02:26.458
Yeah, a kid hitchhiking.

02:26.542 --> 02:27.625
Five, six years ago.

02:27.709 --> 02:29.834
- Denny Saltzman's job.
- Saltzman. Right.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.166
What do you
remember about it?

02:31.250 --> 02:33.041
It was in the summer.
And just like you said.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.208
In the forest,
hitchhiker, .38 slug.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.625
- Remember his name?
- I should remember.

02:37.709 --> 02:39.166
Saltzy brayed on and on
about that kid.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.083
There wasn't much on it.
Some footprints, fiber.

02:42.166 --> 02:45.208
Yeah, he just turned 20,
uh, "Gone good."

02:45.291 --> 02:46.458
'Saltz was always sayin''

02:46.542 --> 02:47.959
'"crummy kid gone good,"
over and over.'

02:48.041 --> 02:49.083
He was a good-looking kid.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.458
Saltzman had his
picture on the wall.

02:50.542 --> 02:52.125
Damn, this name thing's
gonna bug me.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.875
You ever establish who
the kid caught a ride with?

02:53.959 --> 02:55.625
Nah, case went cold fast.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.250
Dean.
I think his name was Dean.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.542
No, it wasn't Dean.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.291
- Darren. Darren something.
- No.

03:01.375 --> 03:02.583
Matt.

03:02.667 --> 03:05.834
- What?
- Mills. Matt Mills.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.583
Right.
That's it.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.750
Yeah.
Almost had it.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.208
Matt Mills, 20

03:47.291 --> 03:49.250
shot in the woods
off the
Expressway.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.583
The 3,000 bucks he'd just
won
in Atlantic City, gone.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.375
Like the other two jobs.

03:54.458 --> 03:55.709
I talked to
Jersey
and Delaware

03:55.792 --> 03:57.125
both are thinking
it's the same
doer.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.375
Serial killer.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.625
Our guy Matt
could've
been his first.

04:00.709 --> 04:02.333
Well, Matt's killed in '97.

04:02.417 --> 04:04.750
Jersey's body
turns up fall of 2000.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.125
And Delaware's
just four weeks ago.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.583
A three-year
cooling off period.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.834
I say we go right now.
To Delaware.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.417
No need.
Delaware's coming here.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.458
Don't get too
excited,
Scotty.

04:14.542 --> 04:17.083
A serial job don't get you
hopped up just a little,
boss?

04:18.333 --> 04:20.291
What else do we know
about the victims, Lil?

04:20.375 --> 04:22.291
All young
guys,
18 to 20.

04:22.375 --> 04:24.166
All three were headed
home from Atlantic City

04:24.250 --> 04:26.542
after winning a few
thousand in the
casinos.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.041
So the doer hangs
around the tables

04:28.125 --> 04:29.834
stalks the winners,
catches up to 'em

04:29.917 --> 04:31.125
on the lonely road home.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.000
These kids are leaving
with thousands of
bucks.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.917
Why are they hitchhiking?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
File says Matt
missed
his bus back.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.667
I can win ten
grand over there

04:38.750 --> 04:41.625
I still ain't paying a cabbie
300 bucks to drive me home.

04:41.709 --> 04:43.834
Now, you put it that way,
I guess my thumb's out too.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.542
(Rush)
'Besides the
robbery and the .38'

04:45.625 --> 04:48.333
we got a size ten print that
lines up with other murders.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.041
Plus the gray
carpet
fiber on the body.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.375
Delaware and
Jersey have a list

04:51.458 --> 04:53.625
of seven suspects
that could've done both jobs.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.709
Add in this murder, maybe
we
narrow it down even more.

04:55.792 --> 04:58.333
Vera and Jeffries can check
the list, see if anyone

04:58.417 --> 05:00.083
had ties to Philly in '97.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.125
- Hmm.
- What?

05:01.208 --> 05:03.208
When Matt was 17
he got locked up

05:03.291 --> 05:04.542
by my sergeant
at West Detectives.

05:04.625 --> 05:05.542
For what?

05:05.625 --> 05:06.583
Him and his cousin robbed

05:06.667 --> 05:07.875
a food mart, got probation.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.542
I'll put a call in,
see if he remembers Matt.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.583
- Good.
- Better get to the family,
Lil.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.583
Let them know what's going on.

05:22.917 --> 05:25.375
- Hello.
- What's your name?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.458
- Katie.
- I'm Detective Rush.

05:27.542 --> 05:28.500
Detective Valens.

05:28.583 --> 05:30.709
Are your parents home?

05:30.792 --> 05:33.542
- Is it about Matt?
- How'd you know?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.667
Whenever it's cops,
it's about Matt.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.458
(Rush)
'So Matt was in Atlantic
City'

05:39.542 --> 05:41.542
visiting his cousin
Blaine that weekend?

05:41.625 --> 05:43.709
Matt hadn't seen
Blaine
for a long time.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.959
He wanted to go
whoop it up with
him.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.125
Yeah, he'd earned it.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.291
How so?

05:48.375 --> 05:50.583
He was working for
a brokerage house.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.917
An entry level
position,
but a good start.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.041
He'd gotten into computers

05:55.125 --> 05:56.166
that investment world.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.500
It was impressive.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.208
During the days,
he was hustling at his
job.

06:00.291 --> 06:02.542
Nights he was over
at Drexel taking
classes.

06:02.625 --> 06:03.750
Folks he worked
for liked him

06:03.834 --> 06:05.291
but Matt knew
he needed his
B.A.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.291
Sounds like your son
really stepped up.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.542
After that trouble
he and Blaine got into.

06:10.959 --> 06:14.333
A footnote in our file
mentions the food mart
robbery.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.375
It wasn't a footnote to us.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.959
Matt had some...
very bad years.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.291
First, he was stealing
money off my dresser

06:23.375 --> 06:26.166
'then breaking into
the neighbor's house.'

06:26.250 --> 06:27.959
I'm glad he
robbed
that store.

06:28.041 --> 06:30.417
He became a
different
person after that.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.917
Scared straight.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.959
No, that didn't
straighten him out.

06:35.041 --> 06:36.667
He straightened himself out.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.458
'There's a difference.'

06:38.542 --> 06:40.333
[voice
breaking]
That kid..

06:42.542 --> 06:44.166
He had what it takes.

06:46.875 --> 06:47.917
He had it.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.041
Well...the next three years

06:52.125 --> 06:54.959
Matt was the boy we'd
always dreamed we'd have.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.125
And what about Blaine?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.166
Blaine's still
over
in Atlantic
City.

07:02.834 --> 07:04.750
You the guys from Philly?

07:06.417 --> 07:07.500
Blaine Robbins.

07:07.583 --> 07:08.792
Detectives Rush and Valens.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.542
- Hey.
- Gotta admit, um..

07:10.625 --> 07:13.208
I'm not that glad
to see you guys.

07:13.291 --> 07:16.458
Dragging up Matty's ghost
has me feeling kind of
funky.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.125
Don't you want
his murder solved?

07:18.208 --> 07:20.917
Definitely.
Look, he missed his
bus.

07:22.625 --> 07:25.375
I told him, stay,
but he had to be at
work.

07:25.458 --> 07:28.834
I would've given him a
ride
myself, but no wheels.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.333
Well, you remember
anyone watching Matt

07:30.417 --> 07:31.959
that night,
hanging around him?

07:32.041 --> 07:33.834
Well, I wasn't
with him at the
time

07:33.917 --> 07:36.834
but Matt is a...was..

07:36.917 --> 07:38.834
...a real approachable guy.

07:38.917 --> 07:42.166
Let's talk about that
robbery you and Matt did.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.083
Those were our bad years.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.250
We were kids.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.875
Kids who needed
a thousand
bucks.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.083
A thousand bucks for what?

07:48.166 --> 07:49.750
Start a vending
machine business.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.500
What, like a Coke machine?

07:51.583 --> 07:52.834
Candy bars.

07:52.917 --> 07:54.750
There was a machine
for sale for $1,000.

07:54.834 --> 07:57.166
And the idea was,
after we stocked
it

07:57.250 --> 07:59.000
Matt and I
could clear
300..

07:59.083 --> 08:00.041
...a week!

08:01.959 --> 08:03.250
Young guys, thinking big.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.709
Yeah. Yeah.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.709
Anything else
about that night?

08:09.792 --> 08:11.458
[laughing
]
No, I..

08:11.542 --> 08:14.041
I was kind of hammered.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.709
- Been celebrating all
night.
- Celebrating what?

08:16.792 --> 08:19.667
Matty had become
a real
entrepreneur.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.667
This rockin'
investment
opportunity

08:21.750 --> 08:23.083
had just come our way..

08:23.166 --> 08:26.083
So this Click Twice
stock is a sure thing?

08:26.166 --> 08:27.500
For us to get in on an IPO

08:27.583 --> 08:29.333
the broker would be
doing us a major favor.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.583
And that would get us
in
on the ground floor

08:31.667 --> 08:33.542
right where
you want to
be.

08:33.625 --> 08:36.583
The stock'll shoot right up,
that's why everyone wants in.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.000
But then it'll re-set,
find its real value.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.834
But, by that time, you and me
have already cashed out.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.125
Millionaires by age 25.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.417
We would've made out
like bandits.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.875
But..

08:50.959 --> 08:53.750
...without
Matty,
the deal

08:53.834 --> 08:55.542
went up in smoke.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.250
How's our list doing?

08:59.333 --> 09:00.250
Getting shorter.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.750
Two guys were in jail in '97

09:01.834 --> 09:03.917
three others have good,
substantiated whereabouts

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
at the time
of Matt's murder.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.542
So that leaves two.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.959
One.

09:08.041 --> 09:10.458
Oh. Meet Sam Royal,
Delaware State Police.

09:10.542 --> 09:11.750
- How's it going?
- Okay.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.417
- Down to one, huh?
- Yeah.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.125
My suspect number two
was in a hospital

09:16.208 --> 09:17.959
in Bridgeport
having
dialysis

09:18.041 --> 09:19.125
the night Matt was killed.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.792
So who's that leave?

09:20.875 --> 09:22.417
Henry Floyd.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.542
Truck driver with
a three-page
sheet.

09:24.625 --> 09:25.959
He's a convicted thief

09:26.041 --> 09:27.750
'con artist,
attempted rapist'

09:27.834 --> 09:29.583
overall menace to society.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.792
Sounds like you know
him pretty good.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.333
Yeah.
I interviewed
him.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.041
He's got ice
water
in his veins.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.417
And a size ten shoe.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.583
Guns?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.291
Got three registered
hand guns

09:38.375 --> 09:40.125
including a .38
Smith and Wesson.

09:40.208 --> 09:43.291
Oh, and, uh Mac
withdrawals puts
Floyd

09:43.375 --> 09:45.458
in the AC casinos the night
before each of the murders.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.875
Gas receipts also put
him near the crime scenes.

09:47.959 --> 09:49.291
I'm liking Floyd
more and more.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.250
Oh, when I asked
him about these
kids

09:51.333 --> 09:55.000
the cocky SOB
smiles at me and tells
me

09:55.083 --> 09:56.500
he never picks up hitchhikers.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.875
What was cocky about that?

09:58.959 --> 10:00.792
I never mentioned hitchhikers.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.834
I want to meet this guy.

10:03.917 --> 10:06.041
I got copies of his
logs,
he's due back
tomorrow.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.917
Where's he stay in Philly?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.750
Uh, he's got ties
to a woman out in Bristol.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.500
- What's the tie?
- Girlfriend.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.125
Name's Janice Burns.

10:15.750 --> 10:16.625
Yep.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.458
'I'm the girlfriend.'

10:19.458 --> 10:21.166
That always
sounds so
silly.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.542
Why is that?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.625
I look like a girly-girl
to you, Hot Stuff?

10:27.709 --> 10:32.041
Besides, um,
I wouldn't exactly..

10:32.125 --> 10:35.542
...consider what we got
a traditional situation.

10:35.625 --> 10:36.709
What do you have?

10:36.792 --> 10:39.917
Henry comes here
for one thing.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.917
Two, if he decides to
stay and eat up all my food.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.417
(Royal)
'That doesn't sound like
you get much out of this.'

10:45.500 --> 10:46.917
Why you let him in?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.667
Because if I don't,
he'll get his tool box

10:48.750 --> 10:51.000
and he'll take
the door off the hinges.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.041
He's done it before.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.834
Who knew you'd be better off
leaving your door unlocked.

10:56.917 --> 11:00.083
Janice, you never called
the police, filed charges?

11:00.166 --> 11:01.208
- Nope.
- Why not?

11:01.291 --> 11:02.792
I know what he'd do to me.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.542
Look, I made my bed.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.250
The only reason I met Henry

11:08.333 --> 11:11.583
was I was at the truck stops
looking for dates.

11:11.667 --> 11:16.166
And now that animal's been
in my life for ten years.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.583
I knew what I was doing
was risky.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.000
So, tomorrow is
just another day?

11:20.083 --> 11:21.125
What's tomorrow?

11:21.208 --> 11:22.625
Henry's coming to town.

11:25.333 --> 11:26.333
I didn't know that.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.667
He hasn't called you?

11:27.750 --> 11:30.333
Like I said,
I leave the door open.

11:31.834 --> 11:32.709
Damn it.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.667
Ah, don't worry about it.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.792
Janice, you say Henry's been
trampling in and out of here

11:37.875 --> 11:39.375
the last ten years?

11:39.458 --> 11:40.458
That's right.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.250
'And how long have you
had this gray carpet?'

11:51.583 --> 11:53.291
Hey, lab going to do
a rush job on that
fiber?

11:53.375 --> 11:54.834
We'll have the results
by the end of the day.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.792
- You check on Floyd?
- On schedule.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.500
Should arrive at
Muncy's Meats by noon.

11:58.583 --> 11:59.667
It'll take him at
least
another 40 minutes

11:59.750 --> 12:00.750
to get out to Janice's.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.125
We'll go early
and wait for him.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.041
Royal's already
on his way over.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.625
He's got it bad
for this guy?

12:05.709 --> 12:06.959
Got a few hours.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.542
Wanted to take a
ride,
see my old sergeant.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.291
He called back.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.417
He remembers the arrest?

12:11.500 --> 12:12.583
Just says
he's in the
office.

12:12.667 --> 12:13.667
We should swing by.

12:16.709 --> 12:18.750
Scotty Valens.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.208
So, how's Homicide
treating you, man?

12:21.291 --> 12:22.834
Ain't all bad.
How's things
here?

12:22.917 --> 12:24.166
Good and quiet
with you gone.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.333
Manny, this is my new
partner Lilly Rush.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.125
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.834
Here's that DC number on that
arrest I was talking about.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.000
Oh, yeah, the two kids
robbing a food mart, right?

12:34.083 --> 12:36.000
- Yeah.
- Let me grab the 49.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.917
Uh, cousins.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.792
One of the kids,
Matt Mills, ended up dead.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.458
(Rush)
'Matt was the younger
of the two.'

12:41.542 --> 12:42.500
His mom said getting locked up

12:42.583 --> 12:44.000
scared Matt pretty good.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.625
I don't know if it was so
much
about being locked up

12:45.709 --> 12:47.875
as it was that Russian
reading him the riot act.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.291
The Russian is
the store
owner?

12:49.375 --> 12:51.000
Yeah, Ivan Medvedenko.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.291
If he made a scene out here
you wouldn't forget too easy.

12:54.667 --> 12:59.000
So I took the phone,
dialed 911.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.000
I should've ran after them.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.834
No, calling was
the right thing.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.583
There is one,
right there.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.500
You!
You stole from
me!

13:08.583 --> 13:09.709
Shame on you.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.166
'Your dirty hands.'

13:11.250 --> 13:13.875
- Lazy, American boy.
- Calm down, Ivan.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.625
How old are you?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.208
Seventeen.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.875
- Too late.
- Too late for what?

13:23.959 --> 13:25.208
Change.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.917
You'll always be spoiled.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.875
Die! Just die.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.792
A boy like you
no one will miss.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.166
Johnny, take
this man downstairs.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.458
Russian tells Matt to die.

13:40.542 --> 13:41.625
Anything behind those words?

13:41.709 --> 13:43.792
Oh, first detectives
on that kid's murder

13:43.875 --> 13:46.667
came asking the same,
but Medvedenko had no record.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.667
Wonder if Matt and Blaine
ever went back to his
store.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.208
If they were dumb
enough to do that

13:50.291 --> 13:51.667
then I'd say
all bets were off.

13:52.834 --> 13:53.834
Sorry.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.625
Rush.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.750
- Working with a girl, huh?
- Yeah.

13:58.834 --> 14:02.250
- She a political case?
- Nah, she came from North.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.291
- Did real good there.
- Floyd just got to town.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.625
Got to go.
Thanks, Manny.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.667
Henry Floyd?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.041
Yeah.

14:32.083 --> 14:33.834
Philadelphia police.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.333
Sit down, Henry.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.959
Get you some coffee?

14:53.041 --> 14:55.709
Sure you can't offer me
more than that, sweet
tits?

14:55.792 --> 14:57.125
Oh..

14:57.208 --> 14:59.542
You and me are gonna
have some problems, Henry.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.750
It's okay, Scotty.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.083
You wanna do me, huh?

15:03.166 --> 15:04.959
I'm not sure yet.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.083
Twirl around once.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.583
Scotty, give me and Henry
some private time.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.208
You've been naughty, Henry.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.750
Three murders
along your truck route.

15:27.917 --> 15:29.000
So?

15:29.083 --> 15:30.417
We've been charting
where you've been

15:30.500 --> 15:32.166
and what you've done,
and not just us.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.291
Jersey and Delaware
cops are on your ass, too.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.542
Am I under arrest?

15:36.625 --> 15:39.375
No.
You're free to go.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.208
'Want to?'

15:41.291 --> 15:42.917
No.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.291
I'm enjoying myself.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.959
We have copies of your
trucking
logs, credit card receipts

15:48.041 --> 15:49.500
a day-to-day map
of your whereabouts.

15:49.583 --> 15:54.000
Dolly, none of that means
nothing and you know it.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.750
Actually, one good piece
of physical evidence

15:56.834 --> 15:58.667
can mean everything.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.375
And we have fibers, Floyd

16:02.458 --> 16:03.750
from Janice's carpet.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.750
Oh, you've seen Janice?

16:07.834 --> 16:09.750
So you know what
an upgrade you'd be.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.792
Three murder trials
in three states.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.875
Anyway you look at it

16:15.959 --> 16:17.208
'you'll get the needle.'

16:18.750 --> 16:20.625
Matt Mills.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.041
You ended his life
for $3,000.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.041
You ever think on that?

16:26.125 --> 16:27.083
I don't get your meaning.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.125
Well, what's the lowest

16:28.208 --> 16:29.583
you'd end someone's life for?

16:29.667 --> 16:31.625
2,000, 1,000

16:31.709 --> 16:34.250
a Swiss Army knife?

16:34.333 --> 16:36.959
Dolly, you and me

16:37.041 --> 16:38.667
we don't see the
world
the same way.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.000
Oh, you're a philosopher.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.041
So that gives you the right

16:43.125 --> 16:44.917
to take someone's life away?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.917
You're puttin'
words in my mouth.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.417
Didn't kill him,
didn't kill anyone.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.417
Then take a polygraph for me.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.125
Okay.

16:58.458 --> 17:01.625
- 'Did you murder Matt
Mills?'
- 'No.'

17:03.417 --> 17:05.166
Did you kill Chuck Praska?

17:05.250 --> 17:09.083
Chuck get iced
in Jersey or
Delaware?

17:09.166 --> 17:11.041
Yes or no answers, Floyd.

17:12.458 --> 17:13.709
Roger that.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.834
Did you murder
Chuck Praska?

17:17.917 --> 17:19.000
No.

17:19.083 --> 17:22.333
- Did you murder Brian Fritz?
- No.

17:22.417 --> 17:25.083
The next question I want
you to answer incorrectly.

17:25.166 --> 17:28.250
'The purpose is to
intentionally
make the chart spike.'

17:32.583 --> 17:34.875
Is this card
the ace of spades?

17:38.625 --> 17:39.583
Yes.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.542
He never spiked.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.583
Not even when he
lied about the
card.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.291
He beat the polygraph.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.959
But good.

18:01.333 --> 18:05.166
You know, you never should've
gone to see Janice.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.375
Now a perfectly good
ten-year relationship

18:15.458 --> 18:16.500
will have to end.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.959
You gonna kill her too, Henry?

18:19.041 --> 18:20.083
Like those three kids?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.166
You're putting
words
in my mouth again.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.917
What?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.542
What are you looking at?

18:33.417 --> 18:34.875
A dead man.

18:37.291 --> 18:38.792
And get those feet
off my table.

18:41.083 --> 18:44.000
The ball on Floyd's left
boot is severely worn down

18:44.083 --> 18:45.792
probably from pressing
down on the clutch

18:45.875 --> 18:47.041
when he's in his rig.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.083
First time around
criminalistics looked
at

18:49.166 --> 18:50.375
brand, size, and tread.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.000
Maybe they never looked
at the ball of the foot.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.542
So let's pull
the molds from evidence

18:53.625 --> 18:54.917
re-submit them to the lab.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
- Want to let Jersey know?
- Yeah.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.375
- Hey!
- Hey, well, see ya.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.375
Lot of wear and tear
on Floyd's left hoof.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.083
If the plaster molds
match,
we got him.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.250
Good. 'Cause the fiber
match didn't happen.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.625
- Crap.
- Inconclusive.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.959
But I got something else.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.125
- Yeah, what?
- 'Manny called back.'

19:15.208 --> 19:17.417
Ran that store owner
through the computer again.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.625
Starting '99,
he does have a sheet.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.125
For what?

19:21.208 --> 19:23.250
Arrested for assaulting
one of his customers.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.542
Then five months ago

19:24.625 --> 19:26.375
chased a shoplifter
with a revolver.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.750
'Fired six shots.'

19:27.834 --> 19:29.458
What kind of revolver?

19:29.542 --> 19:30.875
.38 Special.

19:30.959 --> 19:33.083
'Just like the one
that killed Matt.'

19:35.333 --> 19:37.625
Better go have a conversation.

19:44.125 --> 19:45.583
Philadelphia Homicide.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.500
Wanna ask you some questions.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.917
I haven't done anything.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.750
We're investigating
the murder of a young man

19:50.834 --> 19:51.834
you had history with.

19:51.917 --> 19:54.041
Recognize him?

19:55.583 --> 19:57.959
You know who that
boy is, don't you?

19:58.041 --> 19:59.750
He robbed me.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.291
Him and the other.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.709
Held you at gunpoint, right?

20:02.792 --> 20:04.375
Like animals.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.709
Thank you.

20:34.417 --> 20:35.458
Hey!

20:35.542 --> 20:37.166
'Hey!
What are you doing there?'

20:37.250 --> 20:39.208
- Sorry, pops.
- Hey!

20:39.291 --> 20:40.792
Get away.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.417
I said get away,
or I'll call the police.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.542
Get away, I said!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.625
Hey! Thief! Thief!

20:48.709 --> 20:50.625
Don't move!
Don't move!

20:50.709 --> 20:52.750
Matty, hurry!

20:52.834 --> 20:54.125
Don't move!

20:54.208 --> 20:55.500
You should have
chased me out.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.083
Why you got to make
things complicated?

20:57.166 --> 21:00.291
'Matty, hurry!'

21:00.375 --> 21:01.500
'Let's go!'

21:03.458 --> 21:05.959
They never saw Pejia

21:06.041 --> 21:07.333
my son

21:07.417 --> 21:10.500
and for that...
I am thankful.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.166
- But you must've held a
grudge.
- What's your meaning?

21:13.250 --> 21:15.500
Those boys got arrested
but only got probation.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.250
- 'Did that get you mad--'
- They should've gone to
jail.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.000
And since they didn't,
maybe you decided to do

21:20.083 --> 21:21.000
something about it.

21:21.083 --> 21:24.375
Aah, three years later?

21:24.458 --> 21:26.917
You remember how many
years later Matt got killed?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.500
You heard that kid
got murdered, huh?

21:28.583 --> 21:31.417
Yeah.
Everyone talked about
it.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.375
You recall where
you were the day he died?

21:33.458 --> 21:35.500
Here.
Working, like
always.

21:35.583 --> 21:36.542
Can you prove it?

21:36.625 --> 21:38.500
I leave people alone.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.875
I've never hurt anyone.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.208
Oh, you leave people
alone outside of

21:42.291 --> 21:43.792
when you shoot your gun off
at them, is that it?

21:43.875 --> 21:45.625
I don't have a gun.

21:45.709 --> 21:47.709
Medvedenko, we're the cops.

21:47.792 --> 21:50.500
We know about you firing
shots at the shoplifter.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.583
The neighbors told police
you had a .38 Special.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.583
No gun was found.
Go on, check.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.166
That's 'cause
you got rid of it.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.917
Please, leave my store.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.959
You wanna tell us
about the gun otherwise

22:00.041 --> 22:01.083
you look suspicious, Ivan.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.250
- I sold it.
- To who?

22:03.333 --> 22:06.083
Back to whom I bought it
from.
Mr. Joey.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.083
Mr. Joey?

22:08.166 --> 22:09.750
You saying Joey's,
his last name?

22:09.834 --> 22:11.709
I don't know.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.375
He just has hot guns.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.709
At his pawn store.

22:17.375 --> 22:18.625
You'll never find it.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.417
I want to find Mr. Joey.
Follow that gun.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.333
- Molds came back.
- Ball on the left foot?

22:25.417 --> 22:26.583
Worn down.

22:26.667 --> 22:29.542
Perfect match...
for Jersey and Delaware.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.291
our

22:34.625 --> 22:36.417
So, Floyd didn't kill Matt.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.000
But it absolutely
puts him away

22:38.083 --> 22:39.291
for the other two
hitchhiker jobs

22:39.375 --> 22:42.500
and, uh, honest,
I can't thank you enough.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.834
Yeah. Anytime.

22:47.917 --> 22:50.125
Floyd'll go down to holding
until Jersey can get here.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.917
'You can fight
over him down there.'

22:53.000 --> 22:54.542
Thanks, Philly.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.041
I couldn't have
done it without you.

22:57.792 --> 22:59.291
So, you just solved
two murders.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.625
That's pretty decent.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.792
We didn't solve our murder.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.542
Matt's our job.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.875
Lil? Matt's sister.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.250
Hi, Katie.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.333
Hi.
Is it okay I'm here?

23:14.417 --> 23:16.417
Oh, sure.
Your parents with
you?

23:16.500 --> 23:19.291
No. I got the address
off your card.

23:19.375 --> 23:21.208
Uh, I'm gonna go find
Mr. Joey.

23:23.041 --> 23:24.917
What can I do for you?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.125
I wanted to
know
about Matty

23:27.208 --> 23:29.667
'cause no one tells me

23:29.750 --> 23:33.625
and...I mean,
I miss him,
too.

23:33.709 --> 23:35.625
What do you
want to know?

23:36.709 --> 23:38.583
Do you know
who killed
him?

23:40.166 --> 23:42.041
Not yet.

23:42.125 --> 23:43.667
Blaine said
a serial
killer.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.542
You're close
to Blaine, huh?

23:47.625 --> 23:50.291
He tells me things,
not like my parents.

23:50.375 --> 23:53.041
Well, your parents probably
just wanted to keep you young

23:53.125 --> 23:54.417
Katie, as long as possible.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.000
Matt treated me
like a grown-up.

23:57.083 --> 23:59.166
Blaine's just like him.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.458
Real nice.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.000
Really, really smart.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.750
Hmm, smart, huh?

24:03.834 --> 24:05.500
He knows how to do
all kinds of stuff.

24:05.583 --> 24:07.041
He can fly a plane.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.250
Blaine's a pilot?

24:08.333 --> 24:10.125
- He has his license.
- Oh.

24:10.208 --> 24:12.917
And later this year,
he's starting a
restaurant.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Really.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.750
Well, a
nightclub
kind of place.

24:15.834 --> 24:19.667
I got some seed money
saved up to invest.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.041
Sounds like you got business
in your blood, Katie.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.166
Like Matty did.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.458
He called me that night.

24:32.542 --> 24:33.583
Matt did?

24:35.291 --> 24:37.041
Before he died.

24:38.542 --> 24:39.959
(Matt)
'I'm coming home
tomorrow, okay?'

24:40.041 --> 24:41.208
You made a lot of money?

24:41.291 --> 24:44.375
- Yup.
- 'So you'll buy me
something?'

24:44.458 --> 24:46.208
- I already did.
- 'What?'

24:46.291 --> 24:49.917
- Sand dollars.
- What else did you do there?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.250
I ran into somebody I knew.

24:52.333 --> 24:55.542
Sort of...got into
a fight with him.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.500
It brought up
some bad feelings.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.959
- 'Matty?'
- Yeah?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.750
Besides the sand dollars,
could you bring taffy, too?

25:05.166 --> 25:06.959
Sure. Taffy, too.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.083
I was only ten.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.834
I didn't think
about what he
said.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.166
I understand.

25:14.250 --> 25:17.333
But now I'm thinking
that maybe it
mattered

25:17.417 --> 25:19.208
that he ran into someone.

25:19.291 --> 25:21.250
It might.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.083
Thanks for telling me now.

25:23.166 --> 25:25.542
He first came by after
them
two kids robbed him.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.750
Said he had to have a gun.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.583
You gave him the .38.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.709
Then all was
quiet
for, like, years

25:30.792 --> 25:32.625
till he ran wild
on that
shoplifter.

25:32.709 --> 25:34.250
After that
craziness,
he came back

25:34.333 --> 25:35.792
wanting to move
that gun real
quick.

25:35.875 --> 25:37.709
I need to get that gun, Joey.
Where is it now?

25:37.792 --> 25:39.000
I only had it
another week.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.291
It went back out hot?

25:40.375 --> 25:42.083
Nah, I'm riding
on the boulevard

25:42.166 --> 25:43.375
minding my own business.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.250
These bozos on
patrol
pulled me over.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.291
I wonder why.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.000
Bastards said
I ran a light.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.417
Next thing you know,
they're confiscating

25:49.500 --> 25:50.917
that .38 out
of my glove
box

25:51.000 --> 25:52.458
and I'm on my way
back to court.

25:52.542 --> 25:54.125
What did the judge say?

25:54.208 --> 25:55.834
Ordered that
gun
destroyed.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.083
Wasn't such a loss.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.125
It might've had a
body on it anyway.

25:59.208 --> 26:02.000
How well you know
this Ivan Medvedenko?

26:02.083 --> 26:04.625
- Enough to stay out of his
way.
- What's his deal?

26:04.709 --> 26:05.750
When he first came
to the neighborhood

26:05.834 --> 26:07.125
he was actually kinda nice.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.959
Had this idea
America was gonna

26:09.041 --> 26:10.709
treat him
and his kid
right.

26:10.792 --> 26:12.625
Didn't work out that way?

26:12.709 --> 26:14.792
Hated all them
lowlifes hanging
around

26:14.875 --> 26:16.875
homeless trying to
get
free stuff from him.

26:16.959 --> 26:19.166
When he came asking
for that gun

26:19.250 --> 26:23.792
talking about lazy
kids
needing a lesson

26:23.875 --> 26:26.542
he had some...
glint in his
eye.

26:28.709 --> 26:29.917
Kind of scared me.

26:33.458 --> 26:34.500
- 'Morning.'
- 'Hi.'

26:34.583 --> 26:35.834
Over losing Floyd?

26:35.917 --> 26:38.000
- All about Medvedenko now.
- What changed?

26:38.083 --> 26:39.583
I've been trying
to connect Medvedenko

26:39.667 --> 26:41.500
to Atlantic City
the weekend Matt was killed.

26:41.583 --> 26:42.458
And?

26:42.542 --> 26:44.250
Guess who won
a Center City Bank

26:44.333 --> 26:46.667
sweepstakes,
June of '97?

26:46.750 --> 26:48.834
- Medvedenko.
- His wife.

26:48.917 --> 26:51.709
Prize was a free gambling
junket in Atlantic City.

26:51.792 --> 26:52.834
Trip for two.

26:52.917 --> 26:54.333
Medvedenko said
he was working.

26:54.417 --> 26:55.542
Guess he wasn't working.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.083
Oh, it's gonna be
a good day for us.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.291
- Bad one for Medvedenko.
- Mm-hmm.

27:04.208 --> 27:08.041
- You lied to me, Ivan.
- I had to.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.625
I knew you'd bring me in.

27:09.709 --> 27:11.125
That you'd suspect me.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.083
Those are some good instincts.

27:13.166 --> 27:14.375
I'm innocent.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.875
When did you come
to this country, Ivan?

27:16.959 --> 27:18.208
1973.

27:18.291 --> 27:21.750
'60s and '70s were some
dark times in Russia.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.583
Walk lightly.
Very lightly.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.375
Must have felt good
to finally get to America.

27:28.458 --> 27:33.000
Since I was a boy,
it was my dream

27:33.083 --> 27:34.041
to work

27:34.125 --> 27:36.417
make your own life.

27:36.500 --> 27:37.709
What a gift.

27:37.792 --> 27:40.000
Then one day two
good-for-nothing boys

27:40.083 --> 27:43.000
who didn't think much of that
gift came and robbed you.

27:43.083 --> 27:44.959
I didn't kill that boy.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.500
Take a seat.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.083
Don't lie to me.

27:50.166 --> 27:52.834
You were in Atlantic City,
so was Matt Mills.

27:57.792 --> 27:58.875
Okay.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.750
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

28:01.834 --> 28:03.500
Yes, I saw him
in Atlantic
City.

28:03.583 --> 28:05.250
I saw him,
did not kill
him!

28:07.000 --> 28:08.125
Remember me?

28:11.000 --> 28:12.417
I-I-I don't want any trouble.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.250
You don't want trouble?

28:14.333 --> 28:16.500
I didn't want
trouble
either.

28:22.625 --> 28:24.583
My son, Pejia.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.458
You don't remember him.

28:26.542 --> 28:29.333
But he was there
when you robbed me.

28:29.417 --> 28:30.917
He saw!

28:31.041 --> 28:34.792
Sir, I regret what we did

28:34.875 --> 28:37.291
an-and I heard
what you said to me.

28:37.375 --> 28:42.125
I tell Pejia if he works hard

28:42.208 --> 28:44.083
he can be anything he wants.

28:44.166 --> 28:46.458
But he says, "Dad

28:46.542 --> 28:49.709
why work hard when people
can just take your money?"

28:51.417 --> 28:52.625
You did that.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.166
Sir..

28:55.250 --> 28:56.917
all I can do
is say I'm sorry.

28:59.792 --> 29:00.917
Please.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.792
- Did you shake his hand?
- No.

29:07.875 --> 29:09.458
Because sorry
wasn't good enough.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.458
And who would
miss this kid anyway?

29:11.542 --> 29:12.583
What?

29:12.667 --> 29:13.750
If he died

29:13.834 --> 29:15.792
who would miss
a boy like him?

29:15.875 --> 29:17.333
Remember saying that?

29:17.417 --> 29:18.417
No.

29:21.417 --> 29:24.750
There he goes
lying to me again.

29:24.834 --> 29:26.333
You already lied to me
about the gun.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.208
'You lied about
leaving people alone.'

29:28.291 --> 29:29.959
'Lied about your whereabouts
the day of the murder.'

29:30.041 --> 29:32.041
'I mean, who do you think
you're lying to, Ivan?'

29:32.125 --> 29:33.250
I'm the police.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.583
'You get that?'

29:36.375 --> 29:38.208
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

29:38.291 --> 29:39.583
Because you want
to see your son again

29:39.667 --> 29:41.625
I better start hearing
something I believe.

29:44.792 --> 29:45.959
Please.

29:47.083 --> 29:48.500
You're going away,
Medvedenko.

29:48.583 --> 29:50.709
I'll disappear?

29:50.792 --> 29:51.917
What?

29:52.000 --> 29:55.208
You'll make me
disappear?
Or Pejia?

29:55.291 --> 29:56.583
Hey, you're damn right.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.875
You want to keep
lying,
Medvedenko? Poof!

29:58.959 --> 30:01.917
Now start talking about
how you killed Matt
Mills.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.375
I have to see my son--

30:03.458 --> 30:06.208
Tell me about the .38
you got from Joey.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.000
How you took Matt
in your car

30:08.083 --> 30:09.542
and marched that kid
into the woods

30:09.625 --> 30:11.125
but-but don't you lie!

30:14.291 --> 30:16.417
I hate a liar.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.041
Yes.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.166
Yes, what?

30:24.750 --> 30:26.250
I did it.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.375
I killed him.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.792
(Valens)
'You want me to feel
sorry for you?'

30:41.875 --> 30:43.709
You murdered a kid.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.166
I'll write what you want.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.709
I write, you talk.

30:50.166 --> 30:51.917
It's got to be
first person.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.250
The other one
deserved death.

30:56.208 --> 30:57.709
What other one?
Blaine?

30:57.792 --> 30:59.375
He put the gun to my head.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.959
He was there
that night, too, Ivan.

31:01.041 --> 31:02.709
You could've had a twofer.

31:02.792 --> 31:06.166
I saw him
outside the
casino

31:06.250 --> 31:08.709
but he drove away
before I could say
anything.

31:14.667 --> 31:17.166
- He went.
- Yeah.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.625
I'll notify
Matt's
family, his
cousin..

31:19.709 --> 31:23.125
- I don't know, Scotty.
- Don't know what?

31:23.208 --> 31:24.583
Blaine told us
he would've given Matt

31:24.667 --> 31:26.250
a ride home
but he didn't have wheels.

31:26.333 --> 31:29.166
But Medvedenko said he saw
Blaine driving away in a car.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.208
So, Medvedenko's lying.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.917
Maybe, but you
should check it out.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.083
We did. DMV shows Blaine
didn't own a car in '97.

31:36.166 --> 31:37.834
But AutoTrack just
gave me a secondary address

31:37.917 --> 31:39.333
for Blaine for all of '97.

31:39.417 --> 31:42.625
A magazine subscription
was sent to his workplace.

31:42.709 --> 31:44.291
What workplace?

31:44.375 --> 31:45.959
Roll-The-Dice Rentals.

31:46.041 --> 31:47.208
A rent-a-car company.

31:47.291 --> 31:49.250
It would have given
Blaine access to a car.

31:50.875 --> 31:53.000
Medvedenko just confessed.

31:53.083 --> 31:54.458
I mean, why would he
go
if he didn't do it?

31:54.542 --> 31:56.083
Because you got him
wetting his pants.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.792
You figured out where he
lives,
and you went there.

31:57.875 --> 31:58.875
Ain't that our job?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.542
Scotty, you ask
a guy like that

32:00.625 --> 32:01.750
if he wants to see
his kid again

32:01.834 --> 32:02.750
maybe he thinks KGB.

32:02.834 --> 32:03.834
'Maybe he thinks
you're saying'

32:03.917 --> 32:05.041
'you're gonna kill his kid.'

32:05.125 --> 32:06.542
"Make him disappear."

32:07.792 --> 32:09.000
That was a good interview.

32:09.083 --> 32:10.625
Let's make sure of that.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.041
We got a lot of power
in that room.

32:16.083 --> 32:18.583
No good deed goes
unpunished, I
guess.

32:18.667 --> 32:19.917
It's one more trip
to Atlantic City.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.375
We can afford that,
can't we?

32:21.458 --> 32:23.917
Before we put a father
of an 11-year-old away
forever?

32:25.792 --> 32:27.625
That's gonna be one fun
ride,
I'll tell you that.

32:37.625 --> 32:39.834
We can't get a car
for another hour.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.417
- Okay.
- It's pretty pathetic.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.917
The department don't got
enough cars to go around.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.333
You're just now noticing
our crap resources?

32:45.417 --> 32:46.542
Don't take a tone.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.709
I was just about
to say that to you.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.709
Just hung up with
the Atlantic City Flying
Club.

32:50.792 --> 32:53.959
Blaine shelled out
$3,000 in October
'97.

32:54.041 --> 32:55.625
Exact amount
stolen off of Matt.

32:55.709 --> 32:58.417
- Four months after he died.
- Case was cold by then.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.625
We know Blaine didn't have
a lot of cash flow.

33:00.709 --> 33:03.041
$3,000 all at once
is significant.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.333
Yeah, but do you
kill your buddy

33:04.417 --> 33:06.041
just so you can
take flying lessons?

33:06.125 --> 33:09.041
This wasn't for recreation.
He was gonna start a business.

33:09.125 --> 33:10.333
Another business?

33:10.417 --> 33:12.000
The plan was
to buy a Cessna

33:12.083 --> 33:13.834
and go into
aerial advertising.

33:13.917 --> 33:16.834
Like one of them planes with the
banner flying over Eagle games?

33:16.917 --> 33:19.875
Yeah, for "Ted's TV
and Stereo," whatever.

33:19.959 --> 33:21.166
So, what happened?

33:21.250 --> 33:23.250
The $3,000 got him
through instruction

33:23.333 --> 33:24.583
not to his license.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.000
'Blaine never became a pilot.'

33:26.083 --> 33:27.542
Another
brainstorm
down the drain.

33:27.625 --> 33:29.542
But he didn't kill
Matt for the money.

33:29.625 --> 33:30.834
'What's his motive?'

33:30.917 --> 33:32.250
They hadn't seen
each other in a while.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.291
Maybe they grew apart.

33:33.375 --> 33:34.583
We know Matt changed.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.250
Blaine's looking like
the mope he's always been.

33:36.333 --> 33:39.208
Could rub a guy the wrong way
if your prodigy grows up

33:39.291 --> 33:40.500
'different than you did.'

33:40.583 --> 33:42.083
Especially if that
kid
looked up to you

33:42.166 --> 33:44.750
the way Katie does now.

33:44.834 --> 33:46.166
Let's go see
about that car.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.250
(male #1)
'Blaine took a car
out that day'

33:49.333 --> 33:50.667
I don't have the paperwork.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.083
What about mileage
that's not accounted
for?

33:52.166 --> 33:53.166
You track that?

33:53.250 --> 33:54.583
Give me a second.

33:54.667 --> 33:56.375
Of course, all this tells me
is if a car went out

33:56.458 --> 33:58.458
on such and such a day,
not who drove it.

33:58.542 --> 33:59.959
Understood.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.000
Okay, here's something.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.333
One vehicle does show
some missing miles.

34:06.417 --> 34:09.125
89 miles on a Honda Accord.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.625
About the round-trip
distance between here

34:10.709 --> 34:11.709
and the crime scene.

34:11.792 --> 34:13.625
Sure glad I fired
that kid.

34:13.709 --> 34:15.041
Why did you fire Blaine?

34:15.125 --> 34:17.125
One morning he showed up
with a gun.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.000
I saw it in his duffel bag.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.333
What'd you do about it?

34:20.417 --> 34:23.166
I took the gun,
I turned it into the cops.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.834
You're a tough guy
to find, Blaine.

34:35.917 --> 34:38.458
I've been upstairs.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.500
Got on a bit of a
streak this morning.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.917
The house comped me a room.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.792
Come on, number two.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.333
Come on, two horse.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.834
Even a permanent address.
I couldn't find one.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.458
I don't got one right now.

34:50.542 --> 34:51.917
Where were you living last?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.709
With some chick.
It's a long story.

34:54.792 --> 34:56.166
Been there.

34:56.250 --> 34:59.458
- Yeah. Drink?
- Thanks.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.792
Uh, what you're having.

35:02.875 --> 35:03.834
Come on.

35:03.917 --> 35:07.709
'Come on, two, two, two, two.'

35:11.375 --> 35:12.542
Damn it!

35:14.083 --> 35:15.917
We talked to your cousin
Katie the other day, Blaine.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.083
Yeah? I love that kid.
Smart, you know?

35:19.166 --> 35:22.166
Funny, she said that about you.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.125
Yeah?

35:23.208 --> 35:24.542
She told me about the nightclub

35:24.625 --> 35:26.667
bar-restaurant thing
you're getting
started.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.166
Sounds like a hot move.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.875
Could've been big

35:29.959 --> 35:32.458
but some backers
just dropped out.

35:32.542 --> 35:34.333
Deal fell through.

35:34.417 --> 35:37.750
- Same old, same old, right?
- What?

35:37.834 --> 35:39.625
You just seem to run
into that a lot.

35:39.709 --> 35:41.208
You know, this restaurant deal

35:41.291 --> 35:43.125
and that airplane
venture before that.

35:43.208 --> 35:46.959
- Candy bar machine.
- Why you taking shots?

35:47.041 --> 35:48.166
Those aren't shots.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.709
Part of me feels
for you, Blaine.

35:49.792 --> 35:51.709
When someone's bad at what
they want to be good at

35:51.792 --> 35:53.083
that's not easy to deal with.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.250
We know about
Roll-the-Dice Rentals,
Blaine.

35:55.333 --> 35:56.834
How you took the
car
out that day.

35:56.917 --> 35:57.959
There's no record of that.

35:58.041 --> 35:59.500
There's a record
of the mileage.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.291
'Probably didn't think it
through that far, huh?'

36:01.375 --> 36:03.417
Didn't cover your tracks
with
that gun too good, either.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.750
'Bringing it to work.'

36:04.834 --> 36:06.792
Now AC police
have it inventoried.

36:06.875 --> 36:10.250
And spending Matt's three grand
at the flying school.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.333
Kind of a half-baked plan,
huh, Blaine?

36:12.417 --> 36:13.875
Kind of a
familiar
theme for you.

36:13.959 --> 36:15.208
I'm good at business.

36:15.291 --> 36:17.291
Matt was the one
working
for a brokerage house

36:17.375 --> 36:18.834
making connections.

36:18.917 --> 36:19.959
I taught Matt.

36:20.041 --> 36:21.417
A 20-year-old
with enough moxie

36:21.500 --> 36:22.959
to get in on an IPO.

36:23.041 --> 36:25.709
You said you were happy
about that, but maybe it
hurt.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.291
Matt being the guy who was
the one making things happen.

36:28.375 --> 36:29.583
I made that happen!

36:31.667 --> 36:34.750
The IPO was my idea.
The whole damn thing.

36:36.375 --> 36:38.750
Millionaires by age 25.

36:41.333 --> 36:42.250
Salud.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.834
Blaine, put the drink down.

36:45.917 --> 36:47.417
What?

36:47.500 --> 36:49.542
In theory, everything
you're saying is great.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.041
Now let's talk specifics.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.834
Yeah, yeah,
let's talk.

36:52.917 --> 36:54.500
Who are the principals
behind this?

36:54.583 --> 36:56.834
These McSorley Brothers.

36:56.917 --> 36:57.875
It's their dot com.

36:57.959 --> 37:00.125
And who's underwriting?

37:00.208 --> 37:03.291
Uh...I don't know.

37:03.375 --> 37:04.959
Well, you'd want
to find that out.

37:05.041 --> 37:07.458
Look, Ronnie Mack says
we got to jump on this.

37:07.542 --> 37:09.125
Blaine, IPO's are all
based on hype.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.583
You can't just go on what

37:10.667 --> 37:12.250
this pit boss buddy
of yours is telling you.

37:12.333 --> 37:13.458
When I get back to the office.

37:13.542 --> 37:14.750
I'll see what an analyst thinks.

37:14.834 --> 37:16.208
Ship's gonna sail.

37:16.291 --> 37:18.417
We gotta pull the trigger
on this day after next.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.166
Then why are we having
this conversation?

37:20.250 --> 37:21.959
You said we needed
15 grand to get in.

37:22.041 --> 37:24.166
'Where are we gonna
get 15 grand?'

37:24.250 --> 37:25.667
A casino.

37:28.542 --> 37:29.792
A casino?

37:29.875 --> 37:33.041
- I've been casing this
place.
- Here we go.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.333
What are you doing?
Cover that.

37:37.417 --> 37:39.333
They got an open cage here.

37:39.417 --> 37:42.208
We're in and
out
in 40 seconds.

37:42.291 --> 37:43.333
Are you crazy?

37:44.792 --> 37:46.000
Watch how you're
talking to me.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.625
Blaine, you got to wake up.

37:48.709 --> 37:51.250
Always with the pipe dream.
It's getting stupid.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.875
Blah, blah, blah.

37:52.959 --> 37:54.750
Forget you, pal.
I'm doing this one myself.

37:54.834 --> 37:57.208
I'm not gonna let you.

37:57.291 --> 38:00.166
You're not gonna let me?

38:00.250 --> 38:02.000
I'll walk over to
the cage right now.

38:02.083 --> 38:03.375
Tip 'em off.

38:07.417 --> 38:11.834
Listen,
he don't wanna go along?

38:11.917 --> 38:13.667
Fine.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.417
But saying he's gonna stop me?

38:16.500 --> 38:19.709
my

38:19.792 --> 38:23.375
That runt used to wear
my hand-me-downs!

38:23.458 --> 38:26.667
Now he's gonna
big-man me like that?

38:29.333 --> 38:30.291
No.

38:46.875 --> 38:48.125
I'm sorry.

38:50.542 --> 38:52.834
- Alright.
- Come on. Get in.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.959
Don't you stop? I swear,
Matty, I'll blow your head
off!

39:15.041 --> 39:17.041
Alright. Alright.

39:20.583 --> 39:22.417
Go to that tree.

39:25.166 --> 39:26.875
Okay.

39:26.959 --> 39:28.166
Turn around.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.083
Listen, Blaine,
you're gonna rob me?

39:30.166 --> 39:31.250
Take the three grand
from the tables.

39:31.333 --> 39:32.500
'You can have it.'

39:32.583 --> 39:36.000
Shut the hell up.
I'm talking now.

39:36.083 --> 39:39.458
You've known me
longer than anybody.

39:39.542 --> 39:40.959
Why'd you look at
me
like that?

39:41.041 --> 39:43.166
- Like what?
- You're still doing it.

39:43.250 --> 39:46.125
Put your head down.
I don't wanna see your
face.

39:46.208 --> 39:47.208
Do it!

39:50.375 --> 39:52.458
Nothing's changed, Matty!

39:52.542 --> 39:54.458
Suddenly, you're looking at me
like you don't know

39:54.542 --> 39:56.417
what the hell I'm doing?

39:56.500 --> 39:59.166
All I need is a break.

39:59.250 --> 40:02.750
One break
and I'm on my way.

40:02.834 --> 40:06.208
You've always known that
since we were kids.

40:06.291 --> 40:08.667
You were the only one.

40:08.750 --> 40:10.875
- Blaine?
- Shut up!

40:12.625 --> 40:15.125
There's nothing
for you to say.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.834
I wanna see it..

40:17.917 --> 40:20.166
...in your eyes.

40:20.250 --> 40:23.125
Matty, I need one thing
to go my way.

40:23.208 --> 40:27.083
And no one's gonna
tell me different.

40:27.166 --> 40:29.375
You look up at me

40:29.458 --> 40:32.583
and you show me
you still know that.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.208
Just one break.
