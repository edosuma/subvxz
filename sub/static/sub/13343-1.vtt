WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:10.744
( music playing )

00:10.844 --> 00:12.580
( voices overlapping )

00:13.981 --> 00:15.483
Hello, ladies.
My name is Stuart.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.751
With me, my best mate
Wade right there.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.087
- Hi, Wayne.
- Men: Wade.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.588
Wade, yeah,
as in Roe vs. Wade.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.290
It's a famous case
about a woman's right

00:22.390 --> 00:24.325
- to terminate her fetus.
- They know what it is.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.360
There's no need
to bring up abortion...
until we need to.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.330
My wife just asked
for a separation
after 11 years.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.233
Getting a bit-- ooh, it's
getting a bit gloomy again,
straightaway.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.135
Maybe head to the bar?
Get some drinks?

00:34.235 --> 00:36.070
- No, no, that's okay.
- No, that's not necessary.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.305
Please, ladies,
it's our pleasure.
Get to the bar, sir.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.273
Off he goes.
One of the good guys.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.509
Unfortunately,
he's forgotten how to talk
to beautiful women.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.944
Uh, I, however, have not.
Good evening.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.214
- Where are you guys from?
- From here.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.316
Can't do anything with that.
What about yourself?

00:48.416 --> 00:49.883
Seattle.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.819
Seattle,
I love Seattle.

00:51.919 --> 00:52.953
You've spent
time there?

00:53.053 --> 00:54.122
Never been,
never been.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.656
I just meant
from films.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.392
Um, "Sleepless in Seattle."

00:58.492 --> 00:59.627
Uh...

01:04.865 --> 01:07.101
I'm thinking something
with Denzel Washington?

01:07.201 --> 01:09.170
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.304
It's interesting, isn't it?
'Cause Seattle is actually

01:10.404 --> 01:11.472
the suicide capital
of America.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.840
I don't know
if you know that.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.675
No, I think
you're wrong.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.544
I think you're wrong,

01:16.644 --> 01:18.179
but let's find out.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.413
Let's settle this
once and for all.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.550
Suicide... Seattle.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.452
- We have to get going.
- You're gonna go?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.019
Give me your number
and I'll text you
the answer.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.121
I don't have a phone.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.523
You don't have
a phone?

01:29.623 --> 01:30.858
They're leaving?

01:30.958 --> 01:32.426
Yeah, they
are leaving, mate,

01:32.526 --> 01:33.794
because, um--

01:33.894 --> 01:35.062
because you
brought up abortion

01:35.163 --> 01:37.064
and completely
ruined the mood.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.567
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, well, that's
what happens.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.336
You know what?
I'm not feeling it.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.572
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.773
Thanks.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.882
Hello, ladies.

01:54.982 --> 01:58.219
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

01:58.319 --> 02:01.054
* In the all-night city

02:01.155 --> 02:06.327
* Living in
a lonely limousine *

02:06.427 --> 02:09.563
* And though
he never has to worry *

02:09.663 --> 02:12.966
* He's the only one
and only one *

02:13.066 --> 02:14.568
* He's ever gonna need

02:14.668 --> 02:18.839
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

02:18.939 --> 02:21.108
* Of a woman child

02:21.209 --> 02:22.510
* And some
better kind of love *

02:22.610 --> 02:24.712
* When the hot town
hurt him *

02:24.812 --> 02:27.548
* But he don't know
if he can make it *

02:27.648 --> 02:30.818
* Between the money
and another lonely night *

02:30.918 --> 02:34.455
* Now the time has come,
got to stay or run... *

02:34.555 --> 02:36.357
( beeping )

02:36.457 --> 02:40.294
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

02:40.394 --> 02:43.297
* You don't
want to be lonely *

02:43.397 --> 02:46.567
* Maybe we've been
alone too long *

02:46.667 --> 02:50.238
* You don't want
to be lonely... *

02:51.639 --> 02:53.574
Glenn! Glenn!

02:53.674 --> 02:55.376
Oh, here he is.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.744
All right,
what have you been doing,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.312
scrondelling my tenant,
you absolute dog?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.513
Put it there,
playa.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.282
Is that chicken wings?
You mind if I--

03:01.382 --> 03:02.483
Yeah, help yourself.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.252
You must be
absolutely famished.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.953
Do you know, I don't think
I've ever had sex

03:06.053 --> 03:07.455
and not been
hungry afterwards.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.690
Even when I masturbate,
I get a bit peckish.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.058
Cool.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.294
So, Jessica told me
to shower in here.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.562
Her water pressure's
still messed up.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.029
Yeah, yeah.
Use everything you need.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.265
There's all
the facilities in there.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.799
Got the moisturizers,
the lotions.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.569
- Run a bath
if you want, mate.
- Glenn: Cool.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.272
- * Don't want to be lonely
- * Don't wanna be lonely

03:24.372 --> 03:26.039
* Don't want to be lonely

03:26.139 --> 03:28.576
* Don't want to be
lonely, lonely *

03:28.676 --> 03:31.512
* You don't want
to be lonely *

03:31.612 --> 03:33.247
* Maybe, baby,
gonna work it out ... *

03:33.347 --> 03:34.382
( sighs )

03:34.482 --> 03:35.649
Was I too loud earlier?

03:35.749 --> 03:37.050
What, having intercourse
with Glenn?

03:37.150 --> 03:38.419
No, earlier.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.621
You didn't hear me
on my typewriter?

03:40.721 --> 03:43.123
- Workin' away?
- No, I didn't, no.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.458
You know, they have
word processers now.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.494
Yeah, it just
feels more real.

03:46.594 --> 03:50.998
I completely rewrote
my entire web series.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.933
- Wow, really?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.369
- It's still
about globalization--
- Good.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.706
but now it's about
how it affects us all

03:58.806 --> 04:00.941
on a local level.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.643
- Excellent.
- ( sighs )

04:02.743 --> 04:04.712
- By the way, little bone
of contention.
- Mm-hmm.

04:04.812 --> 04:05.813
Came in last night.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.516
Front door unlocked.
Sliders here open.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.718
Your sliders
in your guesthouse
open and unlocked.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.286
- What's the story there?
- Sorry.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.154
I'm telling you this
for your benefit.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.756
I don't want to come home
and find you murdered
in your bed.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.691
Right, well, thank you
for the concern,

04:17.791 --> 04:21.028
but I had to learn jujitsu
for a film role once,

04:21.128 --> 04:22.430
so I can defend myself.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.931
Mm, sure. Good luck
defending yourself

04:24.031 --> 04:26.534
against some psychopathic
murderer built like me--

04:26.634 --> 04:28.736
( laughs )
You're 93 pounds.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.938
If a murderer
built like you
tried to murder me,

04:31.038 --> 04:32.272
I could destroy you.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.441
You don't think
I could murder you?

04:33.541 --> 04:35.543
- ( laughs ) No.
- Are you mad?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.044
I could fucking
murder you, love.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.512
Exactly how would you?
What's the plan?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.581
- How would I murder you?
- How would you do it?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.082
- You'd like
the specifics of that, huh?
- Yes, yeah, uh-huh.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.351
I'd rent a place
across the street.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.752
I'd be scoping
you out for weeks.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.554
I'd sneak in,
chloroform over the mouth,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.155
you're straight
in the back of my van.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.690
You're dead in a ditch
by sunrise,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.225
and I'm home
having breakfast
with Mother.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.561
She's none the wiser.

04:53.661 --> 04:57.264
So, in this scenario,
you live with your mother?

04:57.365 --> 04:58.466
No, she lives with me.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.300
- Oh.
- And she locks the doors.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.869
And she plays
the bloody rent on time.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.937
- Well--
- All right,
she's quite a lady.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.073
- Yeah, seems like it.
- Like you could learn
something from her.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.108
- ( grunts )
- Stop it! Ah!

05:08.208 --> 05:11.612
Call Mother and tell her
you won't be home
for breakfast.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.381
Oh, come on.
That's pathetic.
You're a child.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.549
( both laugh )

05:15.649 --> 05:18.652
So, I'm gonna head out.
Okay.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.754
We should grab
some dinner this week.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.656
Uh, this week's
a little crazy for me,

05:22.756 --> 05:24.958
but I'll text you
when I come up for air.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.530
Cool.
Yeah.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.199
- All right, see ya.
- See ya.

05:32.299 --> 05:35.102
( door opens, closes )

05:37.838 --> 05:39.673
What?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.375
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say anything.
Seriously.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.177
- I didn't...
- Okay.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.013
Do you want to watch
some more TV, or...

05:46.113 --> 05:47.080
Yeah, yeah.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.090
Wade:
It's like I got
this knot in my gut.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.459
Yeah.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.893
I just can't get her
out of my head.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.096
I keep waking up
in the middle of
the night

06:03.196 --> 06:05.032
expecting her
to be there.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.333
Yeah, yeah.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.268
On my way to work
the other day,

06:08.368 --> 06:09.703
I actually--
I just started crying.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.707
Sorry, did you give me
money for those waters?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.375
I've been thinking about it
and I couldn't remember.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.477
No, I didn't.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.345
I thought as much.
Yeah.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.947
Sorry, just a couple more
'cause it's Fiji.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.349
It's the good stuff.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.251
That's it, thank you.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.386
Sorry, what were you saying?
You were talking about
crying or something?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.822
Yeah, yeah. I was just saying
I had to pull over and sob
my eyes out.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.758
Well, you're single now.
Look at this-- Los Angeles.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.426
Yeah?
World of opportunity.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.094
You could be having sex
with movie stars, if you wanted.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.963
Yeah, right.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.898
It's not like I can
just go hop in bed
with Sigourney Weaver.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.000
- There'll be
someone out there.
- I don't know.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.269
I mean, the idea of
making love to a stranger,

06:42.369 --> 06:44.404
that just seems
empty to me.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.606
( mutters )

06:45.706 --> 06:47.875
Look, Daddy.
I got you a flower.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.409
Aw, thank you, baby.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.978
And one for you, Stuart.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.046
Right, yeah, cheers.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.585
I don't know
if I can make it
out here on my own.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.286
- It seems so lonely.
- I'm not lonely.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.721
- Really?
- No.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.456
You know, I always think
about you eating alone

07:02.556 --> 07:04.592
at that Chinese buffet
on Christmas Day.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.760
Well, firstly,
the food was delicious.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.329
The service was impeccable
'cause there was no one else
in there.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.499
What did you do that was
so amazing on Christmas?

07:11.599 --> 07:14.167
Hey, Cass, tell Stuart
what we did on Christmas.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.303
Mommy cooked
the biggest turkey ever,

07:16.403 --> 07:19.039
and then we opened presents
and played games.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.508
Yeah, before you
start giving it this,
you weren't listening.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.242
Two Chinese men
made my lunch.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.845
Mm-kay. Hey, Cass,
will you go pick me
some more flowers?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.514
Yeah.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.618
You know how
this Friday's
our anniversary?

07:30.718 --> 07:31.985
Yeah.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.354
I'm gonna be in my hotel
eating pizza on my bed.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.389
No, you're not.
'Cause you know what's
gonna happen on Friday?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.825
I'm gonna
take you out, yeah?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.493
And you're gonna
have a steak dinner,

07:39.593 --> 07:41.061
and there's
gonna be fine wines,

07:41.161 --> 07:43.296
bowling, my treat,
all right?

07:43.396 --> 07:44.331
The bowling.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.566
Oh, there's bowling?

07:45.666 --> 07:46.700
( laughs )
You love the bowling.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.301
We should go
to Super Lanes.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.470
We'll do the Lanes
if you wanna do the Lanes.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.040
- I'm excited.
- Good.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.542
Rory?

07:54.642 --> 07:57.611
- Rory? Rory?
- Oh.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.513
I've just got
an e-mail from Susan,

07:59.613 --> 08:00.981
and she doesn't want us
to use Flash...

08:01.081 --> 08:03.383
- ( groans )
- so I might need
to get you

08:03.483 --> 08:06.086
to work the weekend,
I'm afraid.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.454
Hmm.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.722
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.323
You think
you're gonna be sick?

08:10.423 --> 08:12.125
- I'm--
- Okay, Rory...

08:12.225 --> 08:14.327
- Mm-hmm.
- If you just called me
and said, "I'm sick,"

08:14.427 --> 08:16.530
then I would think
you were sick, but because
you've said you might be sick,

08:16.630 --> 08:18.065
- Oh.
- I can already see
that this is a plan

08:18.165 --> 08:19.800
- you've got
to get off work.
- I'm sick.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.769
- Well, you're
not sick, are you?
- I-- no.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.937
If you're gonna lie to me,
just phone and go, "I'm sick,"

08:24.037 --> 08:26.473
but don't say,
"I'm gonna be sick
in about a week's time."

08:26.574 --> 08:28.441
So, I'm not
gonna be sick.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.411
Not this weekend.
I mean, possibly,
but I think it's unlikely.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.046
Right, that sounds
better for me.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.347
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.983
( voices speaking faintly )

08:36.083 --> 08:38.385
Do you hear that?
It's women,
it's women.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.720
Oh.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.488
- That was really good.
- Okay.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.423
Um, let's try it again,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.659
and this time,
I want you to say the line

08:45.759 --> 08:49.362
and have a word
in your mind as you say it.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.463
And the word is...

08:50.564 --> 08:52.666
- Friendship?
- Betrayal.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.267
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.936
( phone chiming )

08:58.138 --> 09:00.674
- I'm busy.
- Stuart: Can you come
into my office, please?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.342
Nope, I'm busy.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.811
Stuart:
It's an emergency!

09:05.245 --> 09:06.279
Oh.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.848
Sorry.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.417
- Hi, Rory.
- Hi.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.752
What's wrong?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.621
Uh, has Courtney said
anything about me?

09:13.721 --> 09:15.689
Oh, come on.
We're in the middle
of a rehearsal.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.190
For a web series.
Who cares?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.592
Has she asked
any questions?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.594
- No, why would she?
- Keep your voice down.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.229
Because, basically,
when she was here before,

09:22.329 --> 09:24.531
I got talking
with her and there
was some laughter,

09:24.632 --> 09:25.633
there was
a bit of a vibe.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.601
- Ooh.
- There was no vibe.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.770
She probably thinks
there's something going on
between you and me,

09:29.870 --> 09:31.238
which is why
she hasn't said anything.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.740
- Nobody thinks that.
- You'd be surprised.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.041
Yeah, I'd be surprised
and ashamed.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.243
- ( laughs )
- Don't laugh at that.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.845
- Rory: Sorry.
- Okay, here's what's
gonna happen.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.412
I'm gonna come out
there and when I do,

09:39.512 --> 09:41.181
just casually drop
into the conversation,

09:41.281 --> 09:42.983
"Oh, do you know
Stuart's working on
some coding syntax

09:43.083 --> 09:46.286
that will make HTML
look like fucking MS-DOS."

09:46.386 --> 09:47.855
Then her panties
are gonna drop.

09:47.955 --> 09:51.591
Silky and smooth like butter.
That's my guy.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.993
Yeah, I'm not
gonna say that.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.394
Well, not the stuff
about the panties, but--

09:54.494 --> 09:55.629
Okay, we're working
out there.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.464
It is an emotionally
complex scene,

09:57.564 --> 09:59.166
so some privacy
would be nice.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.968
All right,
well, thanks again
for your help, as always.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.636
Yeah, yeah.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.775
I know it's a lot of layers.
It's probably hard,

10:07.875 --> 10:10.343
but let's just go for it
and see what comes out.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.945
Okay.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.614
Action.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.652
Carol, you may not
be my best friend
anymore,

10:18.752 --> 10:21.889
but you are still
my goddamn vice president.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.993
Wow, I'm hooked.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.931
Courtney,
good to see you.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.633
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.368
Thanks for letting us
use your place.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.905
Oh, please, my pleasure.
I love to support the arts.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.272
And Jessica.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.241
That's a nice hat...
and scarf.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.243
- Yeah, it is.
- Mm-hmm.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.577
- Stuart: Um...
- Well, we're working here.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.913
Don't want to interrupt.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.514
Don't want to stop
the creative process.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.882
- Just thought
I'd say hi.
- Hi.

10:48.982 --> 10:49.917
All right.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.919
Okay, let's
just keep going.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.987
We might be on the brink
of a total economic collapse.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.058
( thumping )
Um, sorry. I just--

10:58.158 --> 10:59.492
sorry, excuse me
for one second.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.828
- Yeah.
- Do you have a website?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.462
- No.
- Ah, that concerns me

11:02.562 --> 11:04.364
because I just think
everyone should have
a website

11:04.464 --> 11:05.833
if they're
an actor or anyone
in the creative arts.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.267
Hmm.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.402
I can help you out
'cause that's sort of
what I do.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.438
Web design--
Pff-hew.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.807
Oh, okay, yeah.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.809
So, if you need
a web design job ever,

11:15.909 --> 11:17.544
or you need a website,
just let me know

11:17.644 --> 11:20.313
and I can be
your Spider-Man,
your superhero.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.381
All right.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.983
- Yeah.
- No, let her--

11:23.083 --> 11:25.118
- Shh. Shut her up
for a second.
- Jessica: Okay.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.721
Well, that would
be great, actually.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.689
I mean, my manager's
been on me to get one.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.658
Yeah, well, we should
get together sometime
and have a chat about it.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.693
- Maybe not now, though.
- Actually, yeah, cool.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.428
I mean, maybe
Thursday morning?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.965
Mornings aren't great for me
'cause I'm normally at the gym.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.566
- Um, but what about--
- Really?

11:39.666 --> 11:41.034
Yes, you-- what about
Saturday night?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.672
I'm going out of town
Saturday.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.907
Can you do
Friday night?

11:47.007 --> 11:48.275
Ugh, I have to go
to this opening

11:48.375 --> 11:49.810
of this new club,
Saboteur.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.611
Oh, what a shame.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.813
But if you're free,
you should come down.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.414
Oh, he can't
get into clubs.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.984
You have no evidence of that.
Yeah, I might swing by.

11:57.084 --> 11:57.785
Sh-hh-ew.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.386
Spider-Man again.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.855
Yeah, listen, as I said,
didn't want to interrupt.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.723
On you go.
( thumps )

12:03.824 --> 12:06.226
- That's a cool drum.
- Yep.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.728
( office chatter )

12:09.763 --> 12:12.199
( rings )

12:12.299 --> 12:13.801
Wade Bailey.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.936
Stuart:
Hello, mate.
Listen, it's me.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.839
Bit of bad news.
I don't think I can come
out bowling on Friday.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.441
Oh, no, really?
Why not?

12:21.541 --> 12:25.512
My... Aunt Barbara's
really sick all of a sudden.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.948
And I just need to hang
by the phone, really,

12:28.048 --> 12:29.917
in case she calls
or someone calls

12:30.017 --> 12:31.751
from the family
with news.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.153
What does she have?

12:35.555 --> 12:38.025
It's different.
It's a bunch of
different things, mate.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.394
It's-- she's basically
rotting from the inside

12:41.494 --> 12:43.063
and we don't
know what to do.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.833
- Do you want me
to come over?
- Definitely not. No.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.101
( earpiece beeps )

12:48.201 --> 12:50.503
- This is Glenn.
- Hey, Glenn, it's Stuart.
How's it going, mate?

12:50.603 --> 12:51.671
Who?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.240
Stuart.

12:53.340 --> 12:57.310
Pritchard?
The very tall guy
with the glasses.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.513
Eh, I'm sorry, man.
I meet a lot of people.
Where do I know you from?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.950
Well, I'm
Jessica's landlord.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.054
- Oh, chicken wings!
- Chicken wings, yeah.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.056
- What's going on, buddy?
- I was just wondering...

13:09.156 --> 13:11.258
could you get me
on the guest list for
Saboteur Friday night?

13:11.358 --> 13:12.625
I'll see
what I can do.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.161
Thank you, sir.
You're a gentleman.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.829
We should grab
a beer sometime,
just the two--

13:15.929 --> 13:17.330
- ( phone beeps )
- oh, he's gone.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.033
- What he said, just not--
- Ow, bit of good news.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.635
I'll see you Friday
for a little
* do, do, do...

13:22.735 --> 13:24.304
- ( laughs ) Good.
- Yeah.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.772
Hey, didn't you say
you were gonna take

13:25.873 --> 13:27.474
your best friend Wade
out on Friday?

13:27.574 --> 13:31.044
His friend's wife
just left him
after 11 years.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.679
Their anniversary
is on Friday.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.381
- So sad, right?
- That's so sad.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.583
- Not really.
- Don't you think
he should hang out

13:36.683 --> 13:39.086
- with his friend on Friday?
- Yes, you should be there
for your friends.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.388
I mean, if we're not
there for our friends,
then who are we?

13:41.488 --> 13:42.622
Terrible people.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.224
( scoffs )
Yeah, I agree.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.525
That's why I always
put my friends first.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.793
I put my friends first--

13:46.894 --> 13:48.962
actually, I put my friends
and family first,

13:49.062 --> 13:52.499
yeah, and then I put
endangered species
of all kinds.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.734
Fish, fauna,
everything of the sea.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.570
And then
I'm deeply concerned
about homosexuals.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.840
And then if I've got time
to put anything else
in the list,

14:00.941 --> 14:04.111
then I'll put just--
you know, just immigrants.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.446
- Oh, okay.
- Mm, yeah.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.248
So that's just me.
That's just the way I roll.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.117
You know what?
You should be
with your friend.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.019
Maybe we can hang out
when I get back in town.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.387
- When is that?
- November.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.289
I'll be right back.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.690
( rings )

14:17.790 --> 14:18.992
Wade Bailey.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.961
Hello, mate, listen.
Do you know what?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.229
I've been thinking,
I'm not doing my aunt
any good

14:22.329 --> 14:23.696
by moping around
at home, all right?

14:23.796 --> 14:25.165
Plus, it's
your anniversary.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.866
I wanna take you out,
take your mind off things.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.435
- Wow.
- Stuart: Yeah.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.070
That really means a lot.
Thank you, Stuart.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.939
No, you're welcome.
And you know what?

14:32.039 --> 14:34.074
Bowling is for lame-os.
You know what we're gonna do?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.308
We're gonna
hit a nightclub,

14:35.408 --> 14:36.709
get you back
on the horse.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.078
I kind of had
my heart set on bowling.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.679
Okay, do you want to
hang out or not?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.814
- Yeah.
- Right, okay, good.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.816
Good news.
Wade's coming
to the club.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.086
- She left.
- Oh--!

14:46.186 --> 14:47.820
She told me
to tell you goodbye

14:47.921 --> 14:50.490
and that maybe
she would see you
at the club.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.925
Yes, see?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.093
I told you
there was a vibe,
didn't I?

14:53.193 --> 14:54.561
Why were you
cock-blocking me?

14:54.661 --> 14:57.430
Mm, because
it's funny.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.909
Here he is,
looking good,

15:10.010 --> 15:11.544
- ready for the big night.
- Guess what?

15:11.644 --> 15:13.313
What?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.248
My sister saw Marion
having coffee with some guy.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.919
( sighs )
It's just-- could we
just have one night

15:20.020 --> 15:22.589
where we don't talk about
your failed marriage?

15:22.689 --> 15:23.756
It's not
a failed marriage.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.625
Sorry, your
failing marriage.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.094
Oh, you're right.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.928
I could use a night off
from thinking about her.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.664
There you are.
And what a night
it's gonna be.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.100
Got two of these
groin cloths,

15:33.200 --> 15:34.201
one for each of us.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.136
Stuart,
I don't know.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.071
Come on, you never know.
You might get lucky,
all right?

15:38.171 --> 15:39.339
Always be safe, yeah.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.208
Hey, look at me.
You look fantastic.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.977
It's your special night.
Enjoy yourself, right?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.712
Just give me a couple
of bucks for gas.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.114
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.881
Oh, we need to wait
for Kives.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.350
Oh, why'd you
invite Kives?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.985
You know I hate Kives.
What are you doing?

15:52.085 --> 15:53.553
What, he was excited
to come to the club.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.922
Well, where is he?
'Cause I'm all set to go.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.357
So if he's not here...

15:58.825 --> 16:00.760
Here he is.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.962
Oh, he's so slow.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.202
- Hey, boys.
- See you Monday, Kives.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.470
Have a great weekend,
sweetie.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.639
Man, I would so like
to come on those tits.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.875
Oh, Kives,
you filthy troll.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.077
So, Pritch,
what have you been up to?

16:17.177 --> 16:18.778
Dating, mating,
or masturbating?

16:18.878 --> 16:20.880
It's one of them
and you don't know which.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.449
Well, then,
I have my answer.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.650
- You don't have
your answer.
- Yes, I do.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.252
Why are you laughing?

16:25.352 --> 16:26.953
You gonna help me in the car
or you want me to roll
behind it?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.622
Why-- it's not
even a joke.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.724
* When the shit goes down

16:31.824 --> 16:33.226
* Ya better be ready

16:33.326 --> 16:34.861
* When the shit goes down

16:34.961 --> 16:36.729
* When the shit
goes down... *

16:36.829 --> 16:38.131
Stuart:
* Ya better be ready

16:38.231 --> 16:39.699
All:
* When the shit goes down

16:39.799 --> 16:41.901
* When the shit goes down

16:42.001 --> 16:43.103
* Ya better be ready

16:43.203 --> 16:44.671
* When the shit goes down

16:44.771 --> 16:46.773
* When the shit
goes down *

16:46.873 --> 16:48.007
* Ya better be
ready *

16:48.108 --> 16:51.211
* Ya better be ready.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.712
Stuart:
Kives, this club
is very exclusive,

16:52.812 --> 16:54.114
so don't embarrass me,
all right?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.582
'Cause everything you do
reflects on me.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.984
'Kay, thanks, guys.
Been to a club before, okay?

16:58.085 --> 16:59.419
It's also 20 bucks
for gas.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.488
Why don't you lick
my asshole clean?

17:01.588 --> 17:04.391
It's just nonstop filth.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.631
- Wade: They're all so young.
- Kives: Fresh meat.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.066
- Hello.
- Kives, please.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.501
Both of you
just play it cool.
Come on.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.635
I'm s-- what?

17:15.735 --> 17:18.771
- ( scrapes )
- Stuart: What are you-- what?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.973
( scraping )

17:21.074 --> 17:22.775
- Just--
- It's stuck.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.677
Right, just
pull it closed.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.814
( scraping )

17:29.015 --> 17:30.583
( scraping )

17:32.819 --> 17:35.054
All right, okay, well,
just get out of the car.
Just get out of the car.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.090
Not that side.
We've just been
through this.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.725
Come this way.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.664
- Just, uh...
- Ow.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.333
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Just--

17:46.433 --> 17:48.735
- Get the chair.
- Okay.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.070
- Can you help me out?
- Okay.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.472
All right.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.806
All right.

17:59.846 --> 18:00.947
( groans )

18:01.047 --> 18:02.749
- All right.
- Uh...

18:02.849 --> 18:04.083
Why do you--

18:07.520 --> 18:08.455
Heh.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.192
Would you--
sorry, would you just--

18:12.292 --> 18:14.694
there are the keys.
Just pick up the keys.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.095
( dance music playing )

18:16.196 --> 18:18.064
* Your style is
out of this world *

18:18.165 --> 18:19.932
* Let me take you
to another place *

18:20.032 --> 18:21.634
* You hotter than a meteor

18:21.734 --> 18:23.903
* When you touch down,
they know your face *

18:24.003 --> 18:25.538
* Look at them VVS glow

18:25.638 --> 18:27.374
* Shine like the stars
in the sky *

18:27.474 --> 18:29.142
* Girl, I think you
about to blow *

18:29.242 --> 18:30.810
* Let's go,
we can only get high *

18:30.910 --> 18:31.844
* Now I wanna...

18:31.944 --> 18:33.246
Mmm. Smell that?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.382
I love the smell of
poontang in the morning.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.317
Hi, girls.
Excuse me one second.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.852
Quick question-- dating,
mating, or masturbating?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.388
( girls laugh )

18:41.488 --> 18:43.190
A little of everything.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.957
Kives:
Of course.
That's a great answer.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.794
Great answer, right?

18:47.894 --> 18:50.129
* Can't get no hotter...

18:50.230 --> 18:52.098
All right,
now, listen.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.167
There's a girl over there
that I've got a bit of
a vibe with, all right?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.935
So I'm just gonna
go over there,
weave my magic.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.104
Just give me
a little bit of room, yeah?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.240
* Till we're soaring
across the sky *

19:00.340 --> 19:02.675
* So take it higher...

19:02.775 --> 19:04.010
Hello, ladies.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.412
* Across the sky...

19:05.512 --> 19:08.281
- Oh, hi. Spider-Man.
- Spider-Man!

19:08.381 --> 19:09.916
- How you doing?
- Good.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.154
Hi, I'm Stuart.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.890
You guys look great.
Who are you wearing?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.659
Um, my friend's
a designer.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.893
She owns a boutique.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.061
- She owns it?
- Yeah.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.696
Wow, that's amazing.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.465
You have got to
give me the address.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.934
- Oh, okay.
- Please, please.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.302
( laughs )

19:29.402 --> 19:33.206
Pardon me,
is this seat taken?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.775
Kidding. I'm Kives.
Pleasure to meet me.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.977
This is my friend Wade.
He's an animal.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.579
Hey, guys.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.581
So you actually
saw Lindsay talking
to Shawn?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.583
- Yeah, and Chelsea
was there...
- Oh, my God.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.017
...making everything
about herself, as usual.

19:45.117 --> 19:49.088
Oh, classic Chelsea...
I imagine.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.890
- Hey, guys. Oh.
- Hey.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.362
Uh, hey.
You guys want
another drink?

19:55.462 --> 19:56.796
- Yes.
- Ladies, please, no.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.698
I'm buying the drinks
tonight, all right?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.400
- What are you drinking?
- I'll take a vodka soda.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.568
- Yeah.
- Vodka soda.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.769
- Two of them.
- Make that three.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.237
Three, all right.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.105
Hey, guys.
More drinks?
He's buying.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.241
All:
Yes!

20:09.609 --> 20:11.711
- Thanks.
- Yeah, not a problem.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.916
Whisky rocks?
Anyone else?

20:17.016 --> 20:18.485
I'll take a glass
of champagne.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.686
Will ya?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.421
I'll take
an Absolut Limon
with soda.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.456
If not, I'll take
a Grey Goose with soda
and a lemon.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.191
What beers do you
have on tap here?

20:25.292 --> 20:27.093
I don't actually
work here, mate.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.428
Cam you find out?

20:28.528 --> 20:29.796
Sure.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.898
You know what? I think
I'll have a champagne, too.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.166
Ooh, if we're doing champagne,
let's just do a bottle.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.234
- No need.
- That's a great idea.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.403
Love it.
Lovely idea.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.670
You can get me
a bourbon neat.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.838
You can fuck off.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.707
Hey, come on.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.809
Ah, don't worry about that.
No, he's a friend of mine.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.378
- You weren't to know.
- And I think we
should all do shots.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.214
- Tequila?
- Group: Yeah!

20:48.315 --> 20:50.082
And make it Don Julio,
none of that cheap shit.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.151
Yeah, you can fuck--
you can-- good.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.953
All right,
thanks for that.
I'll make a note.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.489
( music continues )

20:59.292 --> 21:01.093
So, we get back
from the cruise,

21:01.193 --> 21:02.629
I thought we had
an amazing time,

21:02.729 --> 21:05.332
and then that's when
she asks for a separation.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.005
Do you want to see
a picture of her?

21:13.105 --> 21:15.308
- Okay.
- Yeah? Yeah?

21:21.648 --> 21:25.418
Excuse me, sir?
Ma'am? Can I just--

21:25.518 --> 21:28.388
I've got quite
a big drinks order here.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.624
Oi, oi, there's a line.
People are waiting.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.361
What's the--
did you see that?

21:34.461 --> 21:36.363
Did you see that?
There's no--

21:36.463 --> 21:38.331
what's the rules--
what's the rules
in this place?

21:41.634 --> 21:43.135
Sit on my lap.
It's not a big deal.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.937
Look. Can't feel
anything. Nothing.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.238
Okay. All right.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.608
It's a miracle!
I can feel again!

21:48.708 --> 21:50.076
How did you do that?
I'm kidding.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.310
I'm kidding.
I'm harmless.

21:51.411 --> 21:54.647
Or am I?
I am, I am.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.750
18 tequilas,

21:57.850 --> 22:00.186
12 vodka tonics,

22:00.286 --> 22:02.589
and a bottle
of your cheapest
champagne,

22:02.689 --> 22:04.457
but pour it into
an empty bottle

22:04.557 --> 22:06.493
of your most
expensive champagne.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.228
Take that, take that.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.464
Drinks here.
Look at that.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.900
All right?
Drinks there for everyone.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.370
- Did you get any waters?
- No, I didn't get
any waters, no.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.338
I was too busy spending
over $800 on alcohol.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.873
Sorry about that.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.210
Courtney, Courtney.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.446
Your drink's down there
with all the others
that I just paid for.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.114
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.385
Shall I squeeze in over there,
or what shall I do?

22:32.485 --> 22:33.853
Shall I squeeze in
over there?

22:33.953 --> 22:35.354
It's a little squished.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.189
I could probably
wedge in there.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.358
- It's kinda tight.
- All right.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.093
Shall I try,
though, at least?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.462
I don't think
you'll fit.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.930
All right.
( laughs )

22:44.030 --> 22:45.031
'Cause he could move.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.769
Hey, can I--
I'm just gonna sit there.
Is that all right?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.505
- No, I'm saving it.
- No? Yeah, all right.

22:52.605 --> 22:55.408
Enjoy your free drink.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.411
( electronic music playing )

23:11.658 --> 23:13.826
Excuse me.
Coming through.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.880
( laughing )

23:33.980 --> 23:35.748
( laughs )
Courtney, what we
laughing about?

23:38.084 --> 23:39.619
Just a stupid joke.

23:39.719 --> 23:43.089
( laughs )
I love 'em.
Love jokes.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.861
Do you-- Courtney,
what are you doing
at the moment?

23:48.961 --> 23:50.563
Are you, uh--
are you dating or...

23:50.663 --> 23:53.533
- ( mumbles )
- What?

23:53.633 --> 23:55.702
( quietly )
Are you dating, mating,
or masturbating?

23:55.802 --> 23:57.804
I can't understand you.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.473
I said are you... dating,
mating, or masturbating?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.241
Dating, mating,
or what?

24:02.341 --> 24:04.310
Masturbating!
( crashes )

24:04.410 --> 24:06.579
That's fine, that's fine.
Absolutely fine.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.548
Don't worry, that's just--

24:08.648 --> 24:10.650
they got people
to clean all that.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.151
Don't worry, though.
It's fine.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.286
That's-- we should--
more drinks.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.755
Anyone wanna
change their order?

24:15.855 --> 24:17.657
No? Everyone's gonna stick--
I got it written down.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.126
Courtney, we should-- shots!
We should do more shots!

24:20.226 --> 24:22.829
- Is that a condom
in his pocket?
- Kives: Looks like it.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.798
Don't worry about that.
Don't concern yourself.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.568
I'm gonna go to the bar
and then-- all right.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.475
( yelling )
Hey, where's the party at?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.810
It's at Saboteur's
on Friday nights!

24:39.712 --> 24:41.113
Woman:
Yes, it is!

24:41.213 --> 24:42.715
I was there!

24:43.983 --> 24:45.317
Hey, uh, ahem.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.820
Hey, Pritch,
Amber doesn't have
an elevator in her building.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.455
Then she'd better
talk to her landlord.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.223
- What?
- It's not my problem.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.625
Come on, help me out.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.662
Listen, she's Courtney's
best friend, okay?

24:55.762 --> 24:57.463
I will tell her
to put in a good word.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.632
- Will you?
- Yes, I promise.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.568
- All right.
- Eh? Eh?

25:01.668 --> 25:03.603
Thank you, brother.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.278
- Stop it, stop it.
- All right, all right.

25:13.479 --> 25:17.784
( Stuart panting )

25:20.620 --> 25:22.354
- Oh, you all right?
- I'm fine.

25:22.454 --> 25:23.656
I'm good, I'm good.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.258
Hey, thanks, Pritch.
I owe ya.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.560
All right, mate.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.662
( whispers )

25:29.762 --> 25:32.264
So you'll put in
a good word with Courtney?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.500
Who's Courtney?

25:34.601 --> 25:36.302
Oh, for fuck's sake.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.938
( panting )

25:48.214 --> 25:49.916
- What a great night.
- Stuart: Yeah.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.151
- Thanks.
- Glad you enjoyed it.

25:56.488 --> 25:57.790
Guess what?

25:57.890 --> 26:00.960
I just danced near
some beautiful girls.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.963
( shoes thump )

26:05.264 --> 26:06.899
See you soon,
all right?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.500
Okay.

26:08.601 --> 26:10.803
Sleep well, mate.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.856
( faint knocking )

26:39.031 --> 26:40.399
Stuart:
Glenn.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.802
Glenn,
how's it going, mate?

26:42.902 --> 26:44.370
Put it there, player.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.605
Jessica texted me
to come by,

26:46.706 --> 26:48.908
but she's not answering
the door and her phone's off.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.476
Do you wanna
come in and wait?

26:50.576 --> 26:52.078
Put the TV on?

26:52.178 --> 26:53.946
Uh, thanks.
I'm gonna head
to a party in Silverlake.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.282
Yeah.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.351
- I love parties in Silverlake.
- Yeah, they're great.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.088
- See ya.
- Yeah, see ya.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.658
( gate opens, closes )

27:08.227 --> 27:09.762
Jesus Christ.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.598
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.466
Really?
Not hiding from Glenn?

27:14.566 --> 27:16.202
( laughs )
No.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.470
'Cause you know he's
lurking around outside
looking for you.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.839
Well, I don't care.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.741
He can't just
invite himself over here

27:21.841 --> 27:23.676
whenever he wants
to have sex.

27:23.776 --> 27:26.946
Right.
He said that you
invited him over, though.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.552
I did...

27:33.652 --> 27:35.788
but then I
changed my mind.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.089
- Oh, you changed your mind.
- Yeah.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.158
- Right, why?
- Um, I don't know.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.128
Ever heard of a little thing
called self-respect?

27:42.228 --> 27:43.229
Or dignity?

27:43.329 --> 27:44.396
Dignity, of course.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.531
Oh, my God.
He's just come back.

27:45.631 --> 27:47.399
Sorry, no,
it wasn't him.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.201
It was actually your dignity
disappearing into the night.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.569
( laughs )

27:50.669 --> 27:51.871
Ahem.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.573
How'd it go
with Courtney?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.308
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.644
Really good, yeah.
Excellent, thanks for asking.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.180
Is that after you fell off
the barstool and smashed
everyone's drinks?

28:01.280 --> 28:04.050
Fuck off.
I don't know what
the rules are here.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.685
If I ask a question,
then you have to answer
truthfully.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.254
All right?
That's the new rule.

28:09.722 --> 28:12.291
Do you wanna watch
some TV or something?

28:12.391 --> 28:13.726
Um...

28:13.826 --> 28:16.295
I would, but I wanna
wake up early

28:16.395 --> 28:17.696
and work
on my web series.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.399
- Good night.
- All right.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.343
( microwave beeping )

28:33.079 --> 28:34.847
* When I get home, babe

28:34.947 --> 28:37.183
* Gonna light your fire

28:37.283 --> 28:39.718
* All day I've been
thinking about you, babe *

28:39.819 --> 28:41.854
* You're my one desire

28:41.954 --> 28:44.056
* Gonna wrap my arms
around you *

28:44.156 --> 28:46.725
* Hold you close to me

28:46.826 --> 28:48.294
* Oh, babe, I want
to taste your lips *

28:48.394 --> 28:53.232
* I want to be
your fantasy, yeah *

29:00.139 --> 29:03.843
* I wanna kiss you
all over *

29:05.845 --> 29:09.615
* And over again

29:09.715 --> 29:12.418
* I wanna kiss you
all over *

29:14.787 --> 29:17.489
* Till the night
closes in *

29:19.291 --> 29:23.062
* Till the night
closes in *

29:28.600 --> 29:32.238
* Till the night
closes in *

29:38.277 --> 29:41.180
* Till the night
closes in... *
