No empty cups, please,
on the tables.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.096
Great party.
Oh, thank you so much.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.843
Well?

01:17.878 --> 01:20.345
I told you that
a Christmas-themed
bar mitzvah

01:20.381 --> 01:21.513
would never work.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.249
Just look at
this disaster.

01:24.285 --> 01:28.153
♪

01:28.189 --> 01:32.591
I'm going to have to decide
how to properly punish you.

01:32.626 --> 01:37.529
I can assure you that
it will never happen again.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.965
Good, because
if you keep this up,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.101
there'll be bigger things
on your plate.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.370
Hug rule.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.641
Table four would like
to know if their wassail
is kosher.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.643
You can tell that it is.
Okay.

01:51.679 --> 01:55.047
Will you excuse me? I have to
go do some of my trademark
obsessing and compulsing

01:55.082 --> 01:57.649
that you've learned to
love and admire about me.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.818
Obsess and compulse away.

01:59.854 --> 02:04.556
We'll continue this
in my office
tomorrow morning.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.891
Nice work, Wright.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.728
Thank you.

02:29.984 --> 02:34.520
Wait, so the Dragon Lady
actually gave you props?

02:34.555 --> 02:37.456
You have no idea
how lucky you are
that you work for yourself.

02:37.491 --> 02:42.728
Lucky? Okay, my boss
makes me work long hours,
overtime every night.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.264
She never gives me a raise,

02:45.299 --> 02:47.900
plus I've got to find
an artist to do the bar's
Christmas mural.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.735
It just never ends.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.503
I think I'm gonna head home.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.506
We've paid enough homage
to my little triumph today.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.241
No way.
You're about to ditch me

02:56.277 --> 02:58.911
for ten days in Vermont
with your hipster prince.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.512
This is our night.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.947
Fifteen minutes.

03:01.982 --> 03:02.781
Twenty.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.785
Fine, but you owe me.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.196
What you drinking?

03:18.966 --> 03:21.900
Oh, it's a little
embarrassing, actually.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.770
Couldn't be more embarrassing
than a pineapple daiquiri.

03:24.805 --> 03:30.442
Hey, back off, okay?
That's like my favorite
drink in the world.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.811
Cheers.

03:32.846 --> 03:37.516
I see you've already
passed my man-of-taste-
and-refinement test,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.930
not to mention you're
so clearly comfortable
with your manhood.

03:39.954 --> 03:43.422
Wow. Five minutes,
we're already talking
about my manhood?

03:43.457 --> 03:46.558
You're bad.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.428
I've been called that
and many other things,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.396
but my friends call me Aidan.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.965
Eve.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.270
How about a refill?

03:58.305 --> 04:00.172
You look thirsty.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.277
What are you doing?

04:05.312 --> 04:07.779
I put myself through college
behind a bar.

04:07.815 --> 04:11.383
So, what do you do?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.684
No, wait, don't tell me.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.287
Let me guess. Uh...

04:17.391 --> 04:18.523
Artist.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.791
Artist, huh?

04:20.827 --> 04:23.862
Or female
professional golfer.
That was my second guess.

04:23.897 --> 04:27.933
I actually was the captain
of the mini golf team
in high school.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.869
I did go
to art school, though.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.871
Aha!

04:35.576 --> 04:38.644
In the real world,
I'm an event planner.
Hmm.

04:38.679 --> 04:44.716
I actually just came back
from a Christmas-themed
bar mitzvah. Go figure.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.519
That's quite
an interesting combination.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.554
What do you do
for a living?

04:49.590 --> 04:54.626
You mean other than
whip up girly drinks
for complete strangers?

04:54.662 --> 04:56.461
Besides that.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.398
Tech stuff.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.834
I'm actually in town meeting
with some venture capitalists.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.770
How long
are you staying?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.839
Out first thing in the morning,
unfortunately.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.942
Hmm.

05:10.978 --> 05:16.348
You know what? I'm gonna
let you get back to your friend
before she gets the wrong idea.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.517
Yeah, I'll probably go home.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.320
Gonna watch
<i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>
and hit the sack.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.758
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Eve.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.027
It was nice
meeting you, too.

05:31.298 --> 05:35.534
And if you ever have
any party planning needs in
the greater New York Metro area,

05:35.569 --> 05:39.071
you should give me a call.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.674
Absolutely.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.712
Well, well, well!

05:46.747 --> 05:49.681
I cannot leave you alone
for one minute.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.283
I have a boyfriend,
remember?

05:51.318 --> 05:53.685
Funny, I didn't hear you
mention that to him.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.922
He's leaving tomorrow.
I'm probably never
gonna see him again.

05:56.957 --> 06:00.025
Mm-hmm. Mmm!

06:05.466 --> 06:07.032
Just like that, okay, bud?

06:07.067 --> 06:10.402
Heard the bar mitzvah
went okay.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.671
You'd probably tell
Michelangelo he just did okay

06:12.706 --> 06:14.673
with the Sistine Chapel, too,
wouldn't you?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.709
Heard the news?
You finally got
a mail order bride?

06:17.745 --> 06:21.980
No. Buzz at the water cooler is
Elizabeth is planning some
sort of big announcement.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.315
Such as?

06:23.350 --> 06:26.051
Opening an office
in Los Angeles.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.652
Really?

06:27.688 --> 06:31.022
Question is, which talented
up-and-coming protégé

06:31.058 --> 06:33.592
is she going
to get to run it?

06:33.627 --> 06:35.894
I don't know, Matt. You?

06:35.929 --> 06:38.697
I'll put in a good word for you
if you want to come work for me.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.665
What would I do without you?

06:40.701 --> 06:41.867
I need you. Now.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.802
Right away, Ms. Cole.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.771
No. Wright. Come.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.710
You've heard of a company
called Gobble?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.746
Yes, of course,
the next generation
social network.

06:54.782 --> 06:58.583
Well, they are throwing
a no-expense-spared
Christmas Eve party

06:58.619 --> 07:01.553
with the hopes
of attracting some
important investors

07:01.588 --> 07:04.456
before their
official relaunch.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.359
Guess who they want
to plan it.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.862
No expenses spared, huh?

07:10.898 --> 07:13.999
This account can propel us
past our annual target.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.867
If we do it right,

07:15.903 --> 07:18.837
we can own half
of the tech sector
next Christmas.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.172
Well...

07:20.207 --> 07:22.040
You know things
have been tight.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.109
We need to meet
our quarterly goals

07:24.144 --> 07:26.111
if we want
to expand, Wright.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.814
Wait a minute.
This says that they're
based in Los Angeles.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.949
Beverly Hills,
to be specific.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.951
I can't go to Los Angeles.
I have my trip.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.920
I told you about my trip.

07:34.955 --> 07:39.925
The CEO of Gobble
requested you personally.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.695
That's ridiculous.
I don't know who
the CEO of Gobble is.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.698
Aidan Green,
this is Ms. Wright.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.833
Ms. Right, huh?

07:47.868 --> 07:50.168
Wright with a W.

07:50.204 --> 07:54.039
Well, I've heard fantastic
things about your work,
Ms. Wright with a W.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.309
My friend says
your Christmas-themed
bar mitzvah was amazing.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.645
Clearly your friend
has very good taste.

08:00.681 --> 08:04.015
Three years ago
I'm having lunch at
this bistro on 38th Street

08:04.051 --> 08:07.552
at my wit's end,
trying to plan this
impossible book launch,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.988
when here comes
this starving artist
out of the blue,

08:10.023 --> 08:11.790
just hands me a sketch.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.727
Just went for it, huh?
Hired her on the spot.

08:15.762 --> 08:20.198
My first and only impulsive move
in 17 years of owning a company.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.067
Very impressive.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.669
Your event is
in excellent hands.

08:24.705 --> 08:29.741
Oh, um, I'm so flattered
that your friend
recommended me so highly,

08:29.776 --> 08:31.943
but I'm actually
unavailable.

08:31.979 --> 08:38.116
Mr. Green, would you mind
if I had a moment alone
with Ms. Wright?

08:38.150 --> 08:41.052
Yeah. I'll wait right outside.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.426
May I remind you that,
at the moment,

08:48.462 --> 08:51.763
you are still
in my good graces.

08:51.798 --> 08:56.301
So I suggest you choose
your next words
very carefully.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.038
I just...
I can't do it.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.541
Darren's taking me to Vermont
for Christmas.

09:02.576 --> 09:06.077
Have I not made it clear
how important this is to
the future of my company?

09:06.113 --> 09:07.946
No, you have.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.315
Christmas happens
every year.

09:10.350 --> 09:14.920
This account...
only happens once.

09:17.024 --> 09:22.060
But I suppose I could
get Matt to run point.

09:22.095 --> 09:27.632
It certainly would give him
a boost in running my new
west coast office.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.735
It's a shame.
I really thought
it was gonna be you.

09:32.573 --> 09:37.709
Fine. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.477
Smart girl.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.379
Yes, ma'am.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.182
And you will need help.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.850
I'll send Matt.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.454
That would be great.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.571
Hey.
<i>Hola.</i>

10:06.607 --> 10:09.808
Picked up some dinner.
Just put it on the table.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.743
I'll get some when I'm
done with this level.

10:15.549 --> 10:19.150
I got some
kinda big news today.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.454
Darren?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.055
Huh? Oh.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.461
Yeah?

10:29.496 --> 10:32.464
Hey, what's up?

10:32.499 --> 10:37.302
So, you know how I'm always
trying to get my boss
to notice me at work?

10:37.337 --> 10:38.703
Yeah.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.705
We signed Gobble
as an account today.

10:40.741 --> 10:45.710
Wow. That's...
That's like huge.

10:45.746 --> 10:49.714
Yeah. They want this like
super big Christmas Eve party,

10:49.750 --> 10:52.017
and they want it planned
kinda quickly.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.619
That's...
That's awesome, baby.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.688
I'm... I'm so proud of you.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.257
Thank you.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.559
Could you grab me
some of that Chinese?

11:01.595 --> 11:03.695
Smells great.

11:03.730 --> 11:08.566
Um, so the party's in LA.
I leave tomorrow.

11:08.602 --> 11:09.801
For how long?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.536
Till Christmas.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.710
But we go to Vermont
on the 19th.

11:18.745 --> 11:22.447
I was thinking that maybe
we could go to Vermont
for New Year's.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.550
I promised Andy
I'd go to Atlantic City.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.318
We've had this
planned for months.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.422
This is kind of
a big deal for me.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.190
And I'm not?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.759
But this trip
could be my big break.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.362
We could finally
afford to buy a place.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.464
So you're choosing work
over me.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.599
No, of course not.

11:41.635 --> 11:44.836
I don't have a BFA in
studio art from NYU like you,

11:44.871 --> 11:50.375
but I know what
making a choice is.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.310
I promise to make it up to you
when I get back.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.582
Hey, maybe you should
still go on the trip.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.150
It could be kinda relaxing.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.221
I do have a buddy that
would like to go skiing.

12:03.256 --> 12:07.892
And a little time apart
could be good for us, you know?

12:10.363 --> 12:12.230
I'll make the best of it.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.433
For you, okay?

12:15.469 --> 12:16.835
Thank you.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.171
Mwah!

12:22.609 --> 12:24.576

12:39.126 --> 12:41.459
You told me you set the alarm!

Once the gate is closed,
it must remain closed

16:18.778 --> 16:21.679
Nothing I can do about it.
FAA regulations.
No, no.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.282
I just saw you close it.
You can totally open it back up.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.751
Ma'am...
My job depends on this.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.619
Oh.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.622
Well!

16:56.549 --> 16:59.817
and pull the elastic

16:59.853 --> 17:00.853

17:03.923 --> 17:07.657
Please be sure to secure your
own mask before helping others.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.028
Thank you so much and
have a wonderful flight.

<i>Wright, you look like death.</i>

17:29.315 --> 17:32.283
It was a rough trip
to the airport.

17:32.318 --> 17:35.686
Oh. You should try
the Manhattan to LaGuardia
helicopter.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.021
It's to die for.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.257
Right, for sure,
next time.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.292
Now remember, you're
representing me out there.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.228
You kick ass, it's on me.
You screw up, it's on you.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.731
Either way, I'm gonna remember
who was running the show

17:46.766 --> 17:50.001
when it comes time to decide
who's gonna be running
my west coast office.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.436
Absolutely.

17:54.107 --> 17:58.042

Well, why not?

17:59.846 --> 18:02.046

18:02.082 --> 18:03.381

18:03.416 --> 18:05.283
<i>Okay, I will. Thank you.</i>

18:05.318 --> 18:07.852
Okay, well, you give me a call
right after the meeting.

18:07.887 --> 18:11.456
And remember, it's
all about Christmas, Eve.

18:15.829 --> 18:16.829
Oh, excuse me.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.230
Another, please?
Right away.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.765
Thanks.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.481
Hi.
Can I help you?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.216
I missed my flight to LA
this morning,

18:38.251 --> 18:40.885
and I have a really important
business meeting this afternoon.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.920
Let me see
what I can do, okay?

18:42.956 --> 18:44.555
Thank you so much.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.991
Sorry, there's a major storm
in the Midwest,

18:47.026 --> 18:50.995
and all of our flights
are delayed.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.131
I can get you on
a five o'clock

18:53.166 --> 18:55.867
that'll get you
into LAX at...

18:55.902 --> 18:57.768
7:30 Pacific time.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.038
I'm sorry.
It's the next flight out.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.941
Excuse me.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.428
Wright? Are you still
in the airport?

19:24.464 --> 19:27.265
I thought you'd be
on the plane by now.
Was it delayed?

19:27.300 --> 19:29.767
<i>Actually, I missed my flight.</i>

19:34.073 --> 19:35.506
Excuse me?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.141
My alarm didn't go off
this morning,

19:37.177 --> 19:38.454
and then I had trouble
getting a cab,

19:38.478 --> 19:40.411
and I broke my heel
on the way to the gate.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.214
Shh, shh, calm down.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.249
Everything's
gonna be okay.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.519
It is?
Yes. I've been taking
this new yoga class

19:48.555 --> 19:51.289
that focuses
on inner peace, so...

19:51.324 --> 19:53.057
deep breaths.

19:53.092 --> 19:56.561
Okay. Deep breaths.

19:56.596 --> 20:00.097
Okay, okay, okay,
this is what's gonna happen.

20:00.133 --> 20:05.903
<i>I'm going to drop my three</i>
<i>New York holiday projects,</i>
<i>cancel my trip to Aspen,</i>

20:05.939 --> 20:09.507
<i>charter my friend's</i>

<i>Los Angeles later today</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:11.542

20:11.578 --> 20:13.511
along with
my company's reputation.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.047
I don't understand.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.615
No, you don't.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.850
Otherwise, you would've
made that flight.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.830
You would've hired a car
to get you to the airport.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.388
You would have gotten there
three hours early.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.024
Clearly I misjudged you,
Wright.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.900
Look, I'm gonna just
take a later flight today,

20:28.928 --> 20:31.295
and I'll there in time to
have drinks with the client.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.532

22:23.810 --> 22:25.976
What are you doing here?

22:26.012 --> 22:28.913
Don't you think
a better question is
who are you doing here?

22:28.948 --> 22:31.015
Just chill, okay?
Let me explain.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.518
Explain? Okay,

22:43.429 --> 22:46.030
I forgot what a sensitive
and giving man you are.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.077
Is that the friend
that you were gonna
take to Vermont?

22:48.101 --> 22:50.835
Don't be ridiculous.
Wait a minute.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.104

I'm not going to Vermont?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.541

Get out of my house now.
Get out.
Eve...

23:02.548 --> 23:04.927
I don't wanna hear anything
that you have to say, okay?
You need to leave.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.817
This is just
a huge mistake.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.387
Since you don't contribute
to the rent or bills
or anything,

23:09.422 --> 23:10.855

25:29.061 --> 25:31.428
It's a beautiful building.
Thank you.

25:31.464 --> 25:33.330
I like the scooter.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.132
Oh. Gets great mileage.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.368
This is my project assistant
Matt Hamilton.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.669
Like the pitcher?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.006
The Rangers?

25:42.041 --> 25:45.543
Of course.
Yeah, I love baseball.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.747
Well, let me
show you around.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.162
You don't know anything
about baseball, do you?
That's not true.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.420
What city do the Rangers
play for?
Cincinnati.

25:56.455 --> 25:59.356
It means a lot to me that
you guys got out here so fast.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.560
Like Elizabeth said, we make
it happen for our clients
no matter what.

26:02.595 --> 26:05.629
While you're here, you're going
to meet my rainmaker Tino Costa.

26:05.665 --> 26:09.667
Thanks to him, we're gearing up
for a major relaunch of the site
in the first quarter.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.713
Not to add any extra pressure,
but this Christmas Eve party

26:11.737 --> 26:15.039
is our last chance to attract
some serious investor attention,

26:15.074 --> 26:17.808
so it better be
pretty amazing.

26:17.843 --> 26:20.778
Well, lucky for you,
"pretty amazing" happens
to be our specialty.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.947
That should be your slogan.
It's pretty good.

26:22.982 --> 26:26.550
Actually,
it's "pretty amazing."

26:26.586 --> 26:28.485
Well, I know it's
a little last-minute,

26:28.521 --> 26:32.456
but Tino's assembled
a guest list of
300 heavy-hitters,

26:32.491 --> 26:34.892
and we're going to have it
at the old Hugo Sable estate.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.060
Hugo Sable,
the movie star?

26:36.095 --> 26:38.462
Wait'll you see it,
It's great.

26:38.497 --> 26:40.475
So I'm guessing
you'll want some kind
of live entertainment.

26:40.499 --> 26:43.467
I'll put together a roster
of some available talent.

26:43.502 --> 26:46.036
And then I'm just seeing
a really solid visual thing,

26:46.072 --> 26:49.873
something that really ties
everything all together.

26:49.909 --> 26:54.545
I got as far as the DJ
and a chocolate fountain
and realized I needed help.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.680
We can have
a chocolate fountain, too,
if you'd like.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.848
She is good.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.550
Oh, yeah.

26:59.585 --> 27:02.853
♪

27:02.888 --> 27:04.121
Men.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.156
W-W-Wait. Hold up.

27:06.192 --> 27:12.096
You're saying that he had
that little tramp in your bed?
Mm-hmm.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.399
She was mostly little,
except for her big, fake...

27:15.434 --> 27:16.867
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

27:16.902 --> 27:19.970
Yours are more natural.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.972
Thank you, sweetie.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.975
I'm just giving up on men.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.543
They're not even
worth the trouble.

27:26.579 --> 27:29.647
Now, don't talk like that.
Not all men are dogs.

27:29.682 --> 27:30.848
Really?

27:30.883 --> 27:32.616
Really.
Really.

27:32.652 --> 27:36.086
Honey, look, you are
way too young and pretty

27:36.122 --> 27:39.657
and smart
to just be giving up.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.026
And I totally agree.

27:42.061 --> 27:46.897
Cheer up. I'm absolutely certain
things are gonna get better.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.566
Good night.

27:49.602 --> 27:52.069
Good night.
Good night.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.839
I just feel like I wasted
two years of my life.

27:55.875 --> 27:59.610
And I was ready to
put on the white dress
for this guy, you know?

27:59.645 --> 28:02.246
And the craziest part is
that I probably would have

28:02.281 --> 28:04.181
if I hadn't have
missed that flight.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.051
Fate can be a powerful
drug, baby girl.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.421
Oh, sweetie.

28:10.456 --> 28:13.824
Why can't I find
one nice guy?

28:13.859 --> 28:19.196
Like just one guy who's not
gonna wring my heart out
like a ShamWow.

28:19.231 --> 28:23.267
Trust me.
This is for the best.

28:23.302 --> 28:26.904
You were way too good
for that d-bag.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.707
This is a sign.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.709
A sign?

28:31.744 --> 28:33.744
What sign, yield?

28:36.582 --> 28:38.727
You know, maybe it would be
easier for me to find a guy

28:38.751 --> 28:44.755
if I had a job or
if I had just even
a shred of self respect.

28:44.790 --> 28:50.828
Stop it.
You are the nicest,
smartest, prettiest

28:50.863 --> 28:53.931
and coolest girl
I have ever known.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.299
Preach.
Preach.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.736
The best things
are yet to come for you.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.871
All right?

29:00.906 --> 29:03.006
You're just sayin' that
'cause you have to.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.510
All right?

29:08.948 --> 29:10.481
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:10.516 --> 29:12.816
Okay, good!
Next round's on me.

29:12.852 --> 29:16.019
Okay, Lila!
Yes, let's make another mess.

29:16.055 --> 29:19.957
It's gonna perk you right up.
It's the holidays, Eve.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.692
Oh, yummy!

29:30.536 --> 29:33.937
<i>♪ Can you feel the magic
in the air ♪</i>

29:33.973 --> 29:39.076
<i>♪ Mistletoe and holly
everywhere ♪</i>

29:41.280 --> 29:45.382
<i>♪ And winds are blowin'

29:45.417 --> 29:49.787

29:58.931 --> 30:02.566
So since you're holding
the party at a vintage
Hollywood location,

30:02.601 --> 30:05.102
for the theme I was thinking
Hollywood glamour

30:05.137 --> 30:07.404
but rebooted
for the Internet age

30:07.439 --> 30:11.074
with a stylish Christmas
twist, of course.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.243
That's great. I love it.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.079
Which brings me to...

30:16.115 --> 30:19.249
Uh, hold on. I'm sorry.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.653
Sorry. Once second.

30:42.908 --> 30:45.309
Oh, you gotta get me
some copies of these.

30:45.344 --> 30:49.046
Uh, these are from
a girls' trip last year.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.984
Matt.
Uh...

30:54.019 --> 30:56.253
Here.

30:56.288 --> 30:59.356
So, um, as I was saying,

30:59.391 --> 31:03.594
we are designing the space
to reflect the Golden Age
of Los Angeles.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.996
What about
the entertainment?

31:06.031 --> 31:08.932
That's the best part.
We just secured Diana Degarmo
from <i> American Idol.</i>

31:08.968 --> 31:10.601
Diana Degarmo?

31:10.636 --> 31:12.870
Unless you would
prefer a DJ.

31:12.905 --> 31:16.673
No, no, no, no.
I'll tell you what.
I like this very much.

31:16.709 --> 31:19.743
I like the concept,
I like the idea,

31:19.778 --> 31:22.346
and most of all, I like you.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.414
And I'll tell you what.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.150
You pull this off,
you're gonna get offers
from Facebook,

31:27.186 --> 31:29.219
from Google, from Yahoo,

31:29.255 --> 31:31.955
not to mention... Al Kim.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.757
Is he coming?

31:33.792 --> 31:36.760
Yeah. I've got him
coming in from Korea
on the 23rd.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.229
Evidently, he wants to find
an American tech company

31:39.265 --> 31:44.167
to invest
a few billion wons in.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.303
Ms. Wright,
I gotta hand it to you.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.005
Excellent work.

31:48.040 --> 31:48.972
Fantastic job.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.440
Thank you.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.876
Save some time for me
on that dance floor, huh?

31:53.979 --> 31:55.746
All right.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.014
My work is done here.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.249
That's Tino.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.417
Happy?

32:01.820 --> 32:04.321
Fantastic. Thank you.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.455
Thanks.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.865
Eve. Eve, hold on.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.000
I'm sorry. I don't know
what happened in there.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.769
I knew that you wanted
the LA account,

32:18.804 --> 32:20.215
but I didn't how far you were
willing to go to get it.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.072
We are on the same team.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.675
Really? Are we?
Because if you pull
anything like that ever again,

32:24.710 --> 32:27.311
I will fire you with a smile,
do you understand?

32:27.346 --> 32:29.212
Yeah, I understand.

32:29.248 --> 32:32.749
I'm gonna look
at lighting bids
in an hour. Go.

32:32.785 --> 32:36.053
Yes, ma'am.
Sound just like Elizabeth.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.924
I'm sorry about
what happened in there.
No, no.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.127
It wasn't exactly
a Kardashian tape, but...

32:44.163 --> 32:46.330
You seriously like
the plan though?
I love the plan.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.965
I want to marry the plan.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.300
And Tino can't stop
talking about it.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.002
It's probably
the bikini pictures.

32:52.037 --> 32:56.006
He was serious about
getting copies of those.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.841
Why are you so nice?

32:57.876 --> 33:01.478
I built this whole company
out of my parents' garage

33:01.513 --> 33:03.714
with five bucks
in my pocket and a dream.

33:03.749 --> 33:07.484
I guess I just know how
to appreciate hard work.

33:10.856 --> 33:14.858
Do you wanna...
grab a drink tonight?

33:14.893 --> 33:16.760
After work?

33:18.797 --> 33:20.764
Is everything
all right?

33:20.799 --> 33:23.033
Yeah, no, it's fine. Um...

33:23.068 --> 33:26.269
I should probably work.
We have a long road ahead of us.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.071
Right, so rain check.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.740
Definitely.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.142
Okay. I'll see you then.
Okay.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.811
Later.
Bye.

33:54.967 --> 33:57.034
Worst hangover ever.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.474
Great.

34:07.412 --> 34:11.248
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.487
<i>Hi. You've reached
Ellen and Wesley.</i>

34:18.524 --> 34:23.493
<i>We're not here right now</i>
<i>so leave a message,</i>
<i>and we'll call you back.</i>

34:23.529 --> 34:27.697
<i>Did you get it?</i>
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>
<i>I think it's off, honey.</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:31.268
Hi, Mom, it's me.

34:31.303 --> 34:37.873
Um, I know it's still like
a week before Christmas, and...

34:37.909 --> 34:40.911
things just haven't
really been going
all that well here for me,

34:40.946 --> 34:47.684
so I was wondering if
I could come spend time
with you guys.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.053
Maybe you need some help
in the bookstore,

34:50.089 --> 34:54.958
and I could lend a hand.

34:54.993 --> 34:57.794
Uh, call me. Love you.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.548
They said they
can only do hydrangeas
at that quantity.

35:18.584 --> 35:21.284
Well, Aidan specifically
requested asiatic lilies.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.819
What is his deal
with asiatic lilies?

35:22.855 --> 35:24.554
Does he know that's
a grandma's flower?

35:29.995 --> 35:32.629
Maybe you need to think
outside the flower box.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.510
They're a retailer.
They use the same suppliers
as most of their competitors.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.868
Call them, ask them
to do something about it.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.036
If they don't, we drop them
and do it ourselves.

35:40.072 --> 35:41.171
If they say no?

35:41.206 --> 35:43.940
They won't.
Anything else?

35:43.976 --> 35:46.743
Catering wants to charge
an additional $18 a head.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.656
Something about the fires.
I don't know what that means.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.147
So what's the difference
come to?

35:50.182 --> 35:52.282
3,600.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.351
No. Get a manager
on the phone,

35:54.386 --> 35:56.786
put him on hold and then
get me exactly a minute later.

35:56.822 --> 35:57.921
Done.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.024
Evelyn Wright.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.261
Evelyn Wright.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.630
Wow. Sounds so grown up.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.398
Hey. What's up?

36:08.433 --> 36:12.202
<i>I was just in the car,
driving to Vermont,</i>

36:12.237 --> 36:14.137
and I wanted to say hi.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.139
There's nothing wrong
with that, is there?

36:16.175 --> 36:19.776
Vermont, right.
I'm kinda busy right now.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.179
Can I call you back
in a little bit,
maybe later tonight?

36:22.214 --> 36:23.647
<i>Sure.</i>

36:23.682 --> 36:25.315
Was Cole excited
about the trip?

36:25.350 --> 36:30.287
Oh, yeah. Super excited.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.122
I hope our room
has a hot tub.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.990
Shh. I'm on the phone.

36:36.128 --> 36:39.229
So I will talk to you
later then.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.398
Drive safe.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.467
Will do.

36:50.075 --> 36:51.141
Sorry about that.

36:51.176 --> 36:53.109
Uh...

36:55.113 --> 36:57.214
Darren, I told you,
I'm really busy.

36:57.249 --> 37:01.851
<i>Hello. Is this the party</i>
<i>planner who's insisting</i>
<i>on asiatic lilies?</i>

37:01.887 --> 37:04.020
Yes, it is.
May I ask who's speaking?

37:04.056 --> 37:07.624
My name is
Garland McAdams III.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.693
I'm the customer
relations specialist

37:09.728 --> 37:12.362
who's responsible
for problem accounts.

37:12.397 --> 37:15.599
Well, I'm hardly think
that I'm a problem account,
although that might change.

37:15.634 --> 37:19.002
You know,
you sound kind of sexy.

37:19.037 --> 37:22.939
<i>Would you mind telling me
what you have on right now?</i>

37:22.975 --> 37:24.441
Excuse me?

37:26.144 --> 37:30.013
I picture you wearing
a smart business suit,

37:30.048 --> 37:32.649
<i>small diamond studded
earrings,</i>

37:32.684 --> 37:34.551
hair down
around your shoulders,

37:34.586 --> 37:37.887
stylish shoes,
but nothing too formal.

37:37.923 --> 37:42.125
Okay, well,
first why don't you tell me
what you have on right now.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.396
Ma'am?

37:45.430 --> 37:46.830
You heard me.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.732
I want to know
what you have on right now.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.068
Well, I don't see what...

37:52.104 --> 37:54.404
Because I'm picturing
a casual look.

37:54.439 --> 37:59.276
You know, brown sweater,
navy jacket, slim fitted pants,

37:59.311 --> 38:02.279
<i>I think you're the kind of guy</i>
<i>who wears sneakers</i>
<i>with his suits.</i>

38:02.314 --> 38:05.282
<i>Classic and understated.</i>

38:05.317 --> 38:08.318
Expensive,
but not crazy expensive.

38:08.353 --> 38:11.388
And you try just hard enough
to look like you're not trying.

38:11.423 --> 38:17.160
<i>Plus you probably</i>
<i>ride around in one of</i>
<i>those little scooters, too.</i>

38:17.195 --> 38:20.964
Actually, I...
Actually, um, um...

38:20.999 --> 38:24.067
I'm not wearing anything
right now.

38:24.102 --> 38:28.004
That's crazy
'cause neither am I.

38:29.808 --> 38:34.377
Yup. I'm just sitting
in my office, supervising,

38:34.413 --> 38:37.113
naked as the day
I was born.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.949
Is that so?

38:45.857 --> 38:47.724
Am I interrupting anything?

38:47.759 --> 38:51.127
No, no. It was just
a wrong number.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.530
Yeah. Me, too.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.332
Crazy, huh?

38:57.369 --> 38:58.768
So...

39:02.341 --> 39:03.740
How are things shaping up?

39:03.775 --> 39:05.275
You're gonna be
blown away.

39:05.310 --> 39:07.410
Wow. And she's humble.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.212
Knock on wood.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.414
Naw. I'm sure
that won't be necessary.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.283
You're gonna do great.

39:15.187 --> 39:18.555
It's kinda weird
not being in New York
for Christmas.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.358
I was there last year
with my parents
on Long Island.

39:21.393 --> 39:25.028
Well, sometimes it's good
to be out of your comfort zone.

39:25.063 --> 39:31.868
I am so totally outside
of my comfort zone.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.803
Good.

39:36.842 --> 39:40.176
You should
probably get that.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.487
This is Aidan.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.057
Yeah.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.243
Evelyn!
What are you doing here?

40:13.278 --> 40:14.744
Honey!
Hi, Mom.

40:14.780 --> 40:20.283
Oh! Wesley, get down here!
Look who's home!

40:20.318 --> 40:23.787
Honey, what are you...
I thought you were in California
for Christmas with your job.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.423
Didn't you get
my messages?
Oh. I'm sorry.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.392
I still
haven't gotten the hang
of that voice box thingy.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.528
It's voice mail, Mom.
Whatever.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.297
The world was a better place
when all we had was
answering machines.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.433
Wesley, where are you?

40:36.468 --> 40:39.269
So my LA trip got canceled,
and I have some free time.

40:39.304 --> 40:40.870
Ellen, check out...

40:40.906 --> 40:43.907
Butter chops!

40:43.942 --> 40:46.209
I thought you were
in Los Angeles.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.845
I kinda lost my job.

40:48.880 --> 40:53.383
Uh, I have some free time,
so I was thinking if you guys
need help at the bookstore,

40:53.418 --> 40:56.519
I could be your girl.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.087
Are you guys
going somewhere?

40:58.123 --> 40:59.689
We forgot to tell you.

40:59.724 --> 41:03.993
Your father won
a trip to Bermuda!

41:04.029 --> 41:05.428
Bermuda?

41:05.464 --> 41:07.230
Two-week cruise.

41:07.265 --> 41:10.200
He says he wants
to rekindle the flame.

41:10.235 --> 41:11.468
TMI, Mom.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.736
Oh, what?
We have needs, too.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.072
And if we didn't,
you wouldn't be here.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.308
Right on.

41:18.343 --> 41:19.542
Eww.
Darling!

41:19.578 --> 41:21.478
What?

41:21.513 --> 41:23.279
Honey, what about Darren?

41:23.315 --> 41:26.216
I thought you two
were going to Vermont.

41:26.251 --> 41:29.018
We broke up.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.287
What? Oh, no.
Sweetheart, what happened?

41:31.323 --> 41:33.122
He cheated on me.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.624
No!

41:34.659 --> 41:36.359
I'm actually okay.

41:36.394 --> 41:38.428
I just kinda wanted to
spend some time at home.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.365
What now?

41:42.400 --> 41:46.102
Well, you know how your mother
always wanted a sewing room.

41:46.137 --> 41:49.339
You guys turned my room
into a sewing room?

41:49.374 --> 41:51.207
Only half.

41:51.243 --> 41:53.243
The other half is your
father's treadmill.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.511
It's an elliptical.

41:54.546 --> 41:57.280
His doctor says his back
needs strengthening.

41:57.315 --> 42:00.917
We'll be strengthening it
this weekend.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.986
You guys, I'm literally
right here!

42:03.021 --> 42:05.355
Honey, I'm sorry. Look,

42:05.390 --> 42:09.292
we just thought it looked
like things were going
so well for you.

42:09.327 --> 42:12.228
It is. It was.

42:12.264 --> 42:14.664
We have the pull-out couch.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.466
It's okay.
Don't worry about it, Dad.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.568
I'll go spend a couple days
with Lila in the city.

42:18.603 --> 42:20.703
It's not a big deal.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.672
Baby, I'm so sorry.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.440
Don't be.

42:24.476 --> 42:26.175
You guys go have fun.

42:26.211 --> 42:29.512
Not before a big Wright
family hug. Come on.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.147
Bring it in.
Let's go.

42:33.285 --> 42:35.318
Oh.
Yes.

42:35.353 --> 42:36.719
Now, doesn't that
feel good?

42:36.755 --> 42:44.755
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

42:59.110 --> 43:02.245
Okay, so just let me know
when the lilies arrive.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.213
Evelyn Wright.

43:04.249 --> 43:07.550
I heard from Aidan that
things are progressing
very nicely.

43:07.586 --> 43:11.387
No, no, no! That tree
goes ten feet to the left.

43:11.423 --> 43:13.022
Your other left.

43:15.594 --> 43:17.393
Thank you. I'm sorry.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.462
There's so much to do
and so little time.

43:19.497 --> 43:22.398
No need to apologize.
You're doing exactly
what needs to be done.

43:22.434 --> 43:25.401
This party must be
absolutely perfect.

43:25.437 --> 43:27.277
Well, thank you for
giving me this opportunity.

43:27.305 --> 43:28.504
I really appreciate it.

43:28.540 --> 43:30.039
Thank the woman
in the mirror.

43:30.075 --> 43:32.308
<i>She's the reason
you're there.</i>

43:32.344 --> 43:35.244
Oh, can I call you back
in a minute? Diana just arrived.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.713
Sure. Call me
if you need anything.

43:36.748 --> 43:40.216
But remember,
think perfection.

43:40.251 --> 43:42.719
Consider perfection thought.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.487
<i>Ciao.</i>

43:46.157 --> 43:47.523
Hi.
Hi!

43:47.559 --> 43:49.258
Thank you so much
for being here.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.494
Absolutely.

43:51.529 --> 43:53.062
This is gonna be fun.
Yeah.

43:53.098 --> 43:54.664
And it looks great.

43:54.699 --> 43:56.877
Thank you so much. And, hey,
if you're ever in New York,

43:56.901 --> 43:58.868
I would love to make this up
to you somehow.

43:58.903 --> 44:01.304
I just might
take you up on that.
Okay.

44:01.339 --> 44:03.684
Oh, Matt, could you show Diane
to her dressing room, please?

44:03.708 --> 44:06.242
Yes, right this way,
Ms. Degarmo.

44:06.277 --> 44:09.212
I'll see you
in a little bit.
Bye.

44:09.247 --> 44:12.782
What do you think?
I think I just saw
Diana Degarmo in person.

44:12.817 --> 44:16.119
And I think this is gonna be
the party of a lifetime.

44:16.154 --> 44:20.023
Oh. Thank goodness you're not
racking up the pressure.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.902
Have you taken any time for
yourself since you've been here?

44:21.926 --> 44:25.161
I've been eating,
sleeping a little bit,

44:25.196 --> 44:27.597
bathing,
occasionally getting
to go to the bathroom.

44:27.632 --> 44:31.100
What do you think about
taking a step back,
have a little fun?

44:31.136 --> 44:32.635
Fun? Now?

44:32.671 --> 44:33.803
Well, I'm the client,
right?

44:33.838 --> 44:35.171
Yes.

44:35.206 --> 44:38.207
So basically you have
to do whatever I say.

44:38.243 --> 44:40.443
I don't have to do
whatever you say.

44:40.478 --> 44:44.514
Well, as a client,
I am requesting that
you have some fun.

44:44.549 --> 44:46.015
What are you suggesting?

44:48.186 --> 44:49.186
I got it.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.220
Oh, no.
No, it's a good one.

44:51.256 --> 44:53.690
I'm scared.
Two hours, we'll have you
back to all this.

44:53.725 --> 44:55.358
One hour.

44:55.393 --> 44:58.695
You don't happen to have
a change of clothes, do you?

45:08.473 --> 45:10.440
<i>♪ Oh, boy ♪</i>

45:10.475 --> 45:13.476
<i>♪ Well, it's Christmastime
again ♪</i>

45:13.511 --> 45:15.778
<i>♪ Let all your good cheer in ♪</i>

45:15.814 --> 45:21.184
<i>♪ It's Christmastime
It's Christmastime again ♪</i>

45:21.219 --> 45:23.586
<i>♪ Stockings are hung
and the tree is trimmed ♪</i>

45:23.621 --> 45:25.621
<i>♪ Sounds of the season
are ringin' on in ♪</i>

45:25.657 --> 45:26.823
Okay.

45:30.862 --> 45:33.730
And up next
we have Aidan Green

45:33.765 --> 45:37.867
lining up for what is surely
to be the most important putt
of his storied career.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.769
Okay, there's enough
pressure as it is.

45:39.804 --> 45:42.238
Think you can back off,
Jim Nantz?

45:42.273 --> 45:46.209
Hey, if this doesn't work out,
there's always caddy school.

45:46.244 --> 45:49.112
I might end up there anyway
if your party doesn't work out.

45:49.147 --> 45:53.516
Don't you worry about me,
okay? You just focus.

45:53.551 --> 45:55.752
You east coast girls
are so cutthroat.

45:55.787 --> 45:57.754
Just putt.

45:59.557 --> 46:00.790
Oh, yeah.

46:00.825 --> 46:03.259
What'd I tell ya?

46:03.294 --> 46:05.328
Annoying. My turn.
All right.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.562
You ready for this?
I'm ready.

46:06.598 --> 46:07.930
Ahem!

46:09.801 --> 46:12.568
I'm sorry to hear
about your parents.
I'm 30 years old.

46:12.604 --> 46:17.106
I shouldn't be concerned
if my 60-year-old parents
wanna hang out with me.

46:17.142 --> 46:19.642
I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

46:19.677 --> 46:21.611
That's easy for you to say.

46:21.646 --> 46:23.146
You have it together.

46:23.181 --> 46:25.414
You know what
you're doing tomorrow.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.884
Me, I'm like alone,

46:27.919 --> 46:32.188
and thanks to Elizabeth,
my resume might as well
be in Pig Latin.

46:32.223 --> 46:33.256
Miss that!

46:33.291 --> 46:35.758
Can you stop feeling
sorry for yourself

46:35.794 --> 46:38.427
and let me putt
in peace?
Mm-hmm.

46:38.463 --> 46:39.529
Thank you.

46:41.599 --> 46:43.533
Oh! Thank you!

46:43.568 --> 46:45.735
Your turn.

46:45.770 --> 46:47.703
All right.
You needed this
more than I thought.

46:47.739 --> 46:51.307
Yeah.
I'll bet you a snow cone
you miss it.

46:51.342 --> 46:54.577
You know, betting on sports is
frowned upon by most companies.

46:54.612 --> 46:56.646
But winning isn't.

46:56.681 --> 46:59.248
And snow cones
taste so much better
when somebody else buys it.

46:59.284 --> 47:02.351
Did you just wink at me?
No.

47:02.387 --> 47:05.621
The battle-hardened,
poised Evelyn Wright
just winked at me?

47:05.657 --> 47:07.456
I had a bug in my eye.

47:07.492 --> 47:08.758
Was it a winking bug?

47:08.793 --> 47:11.227
Just hit the ball.

47:11.262 --> 47:13.162
All right. Here we go.

47:15.733 --> 47:17.567
That's what
I'm talking about!

47:17.602 --> 47:20.369
Nice, nice.

47:20.405 --> 47:23.439
Wait. I have an idea.
Why don't you come
work for me?

47:23.474 --> 47:25.174
Lila...

47:25.210 --> 47:27.577
Just a couple days a week.
It's not big money,

47:27.612 --> 47:31.781
but a go-getter like yourself
could make a couple hundred
a night, easy.

47:31.816 --> 47:33.683
Or I could just strip.

47:33.718 --> 47:35.518
I'll take that as a yes.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.320
Sure. Why not?

47:37.355 --> 47:40.156
Good, okay.
Now, your first assignment

47:40.191 --> 47:43.626
is gonna be painting me
that Christmas mural.

47:43.661 --> 47:45.561
I am your boss now,

47:45.597 --> 47:47.875
and I want you
to paint me a mural on
the front of that window.

47:47.899 --> 47:49.699
I haven't signed
any contracts yet.

47:49.734 --> 47:53.703
Come on.
You're a talented artist.

47:53.738 --> 47:56.539
I left that part of my life
behind a long time ago.

47:56.574 --> 47:58.507
Maybe you shouldn't have.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.321
Maybe you should
have been nurturing
your God-given talent

48:00.345 --> 48:02.945
instead of wasting it
inside a cubicle.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.814
Okay, fine.

48:04.849 --> 48:05.948
What the heck?
I'll do it.

48:05.984 --> 48:07.383
Yeah?

48:07.418 --> 48:08.651
Yeah.

48:08.686 --> 48:10.987
Yeah! Okay.

48:11.022 --> 48:13.689
Move it, girl.
You gonna let me putt?

48:13.725 --> 48:14.757
Be the ball.

48:14.792 --> 48:16.559
Gonna hit you.

48:21.633 --> 48:23.299
Hmm.
Oh...

48:24.469 --> 48:26.335
You owe me a mural.

48:26.371 --> 48:29.238
It's okay.
You'll get the next one.

48:31.776 --> 48:35.077
So I turned on some of
my trademark Wright charm,

48:35.113 --> 48:38.948
and the guy had no choice
but to let me on the plane.

48:38.983 --> 48:40.783
And what if
you'd missed the plane?

48:40.818 --> 48:42.752
Elizabeth
would have fired me,

48:42.787 --> 48:45.521
and I would be playing mini golf
in Astoria right now

48:45.556 --> 48:47.623
with my friend Lila.

48:47.659 --> 48:52.461
So the difference between
having an amazing,
career-defining event

48:52.497 --> 48:56.432
and needing a soup kitchen for
dinner was this last-minute
dash onto a plane?

48:56.467 --> 49:00.102
Technically, although maybe
that's a little oversimplified.

49:00.138 --> 49:04.573
I don't know.
I'm a believer
in pure destiny.

49:04.609 --> 49:06.309
Which is what?

49:06.344 --> 49:09.312
If it's meant to be,
it will be.

49:09.347 --> 49:11.514
Somehow, some way.

49:11.549 --> 49:13.316
Simple as that.

49:13.351 --> 49:17.320
That sounds like
the battle cry
of a lazy person,

49:17.355 --> 49:20.056
not a successful
executive.

49:20.091 --> 49:23.059
Do you know
I played baseball
in college?
No.

49:23.094 --> 49:25.428
Full scholarship.
I was headed to the minors.

49:25.463 --> 49:26.862
Wow. What happened?

49:26.898 --> 49:29.999
One day I was out there,
I was up at the plate,

49:30.034 --> 49:34.870
had my bat in my hands
and, uh, it just hit me.

49:34.906 --> 49:37.573
It's not where I belonged.

49:37.608 --> 49:38.874
So I left.

49:38.910 --> 49:41.277
In the middle of the game.

49:41.312 --> 49:43.879
The coach had a problem
with that.

49:43.915 --> 49:45.815
I bet.

49:45.850 --> 49:47.950
You hungry?

49:47.986 --> 49:49.952
Wanna grab some lunch?

49:49.988 --> 49:51.387
Here?

49:51.422 --> 49:53.589
A minute ago, you're
wagering for snow cones,

49:53.624 --> 49:56.292
now you're telling me
you can't handle
a pepperoni pizza?

49:56.327 --> 49:58.728
Oh, I can handle
pepperoni pizza.

49:58.763 --> 50:00.529
Prove it.

50:00.565 --> 50:02.631
You're on.

50:02.667 --> 50:03.933
All right.

50:08.139 --> 50:12.041
Oh, he's so adorable.
He is adorable.

50:12.076 --> 50:14.443
Do you have any kids?

50:14.479 --> 50:16.045
Seven.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.513
Really?

50:17.548 --> 50:19.615
I was very busy
in my early twenties.

50:19.650 --> 50:21.384
Let's see there's, uh,

50:21.419 --> 50:24.854
Scott, Jackie,
Darla, Alfalfa...

50:24.889 --> 50:28.657
Not funny.
Buckwheat...

50:28.693 --> 50:30.026
You're terrible.

50:30.061 --> 50:31.594
No, in answer
to your question,

50:31.629 --> 50:33.896
I am childless
and alone.

50:33.931 --> 50:36.065
I seriously doubt the latter.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.900
That's true.

50:37.935 --> 50:42.371
I recently broke up with
my long-term girlfriend
a couple months ago.

50:42.407 --> 50:46.575
She said she wanted space,
so I gave it to her.

50:46.611 --> 50:48.144
That sucks. I'm sorry.

50:48.179 --> 50:51.313
At the time I thought
it was for the best,

50:51.349 --> 50:54.950
but lately I'm... I'm...

50:54.986 --> 50:58.387
even more sure that it was.

50:59.757 --> 51:02.291
What about you?

51:02.326 --> 51:04.427
Do you have anyone
back in New York?

51:06.564 --> 51:07.496
More drinks?

51:07.532 --> 51:10.533
Uh, yeah, sure.
Sure, thanks.

51:10.568 --> 51:11.568
Ohh!

51:12.003 --> 51:13.502
Oh, I am...

51:13.538 --> 51:14.570
I am so sorry.

51:14.605 --> 51:15.938
Can I help you?

51:15.973 --> 51:19.208
No, no, it's okay.
Don't worry. Thank you.

51:19.243 --> 51:22.078
I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom
and go clean off.

51:22.113 --> 51:23.846
You can just take it off.
I won't mind.

51:23.881 --> 51:25.748
I'm sure you wouldn't.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.997
What are you doing?

51:42.033 --> 51:44.667
This is crazy.
You have a boyfriend.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.802
He's about to propose to you.

51:55.513 --> 51:57.847
"After losing a new client
in California,

51:57.882 --> 52:00.950
Elizabeth Cole has decided
to take her company
in a new direction."

52:12.597 --> 52:13.597
Eve.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.299
Eve, wait up.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.704
Hey.
I'm running really late.

52:21.739 --> 52:22.938
I'll walk with you.

52:22.974 --> 52:26.575
You look, uh, different.

52:26.611 --> 52:28.110
Good different
or bad different?

52:28.146 --> 52:31.614
Good different.
The hair, the makeup.

52:31.649 --> 52:34.884
You look the way you looked
when we first met.

52:34.919 --> 52:36.886
A lot's happened.

52:38.189 --> 52:40.823
I got a job.
Bike messenger.

52:40.858 --> 52:44.994
It's not great money,
but it's putting
takeout on the table.

52:45.029 --> 52:46.629
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

52:46.664 --> 52:49.665
Oh, and before I forget...

52:49.700 --> 52:54.570
For the last month
of utilities and rent.

52:54.605 --> 52:57.106
I'm sorry for not being
better with that.

52:57.141 --> 53:00.543
And look, I haven't
had a second go by
since that day

53:00.578 --> 53:03.712
that I haven't felt
disgusted with myself.

53:03.748 --> 53:06.649
Good. That makes two of us
that are completely
disgusted by you.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.018
I know, and you're
totally justified.

53:09.053 --> 53:12.488
There's no excuse,
and I'm not trying
to make an excuse.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.890
But I know how big
a mistake I made.

53:14.926 --> 53:16.403
And it's one that
I will never make again.

53:16.427 --> 53:18.661
What do you want me
to do, Darren?

53:18.696 --> 53:20.941
You want me to take you back
into my life again like
nothing happened?

53:20.965 --> 53:22.765
How could I do that?

53:22.800 --> 53:25.634
I'm never gonna get
that image out of my mind.

53:25.670 --> 53:29.104
I know, but maybe
we can make new images
together.

53:29.140 --> 53:30.439
Good ones.

53:32.410 --> 53:35.244
I will literally do anything
to get you back.

53:35.279 --> 53:37.580
Just name it.

53:37.615 --> 53:40.015
Can you go back in time
and not cheat on me?

53:40.051 --> 53:42.918
Can you do that?

53:42.954 --> 53:45.054
I didn't think so.

54:05.576 --> 54:07.576
Hi, babe.
<i>Hi.</i>

54:07.612 --> 54:11.680
Just wanted to call
and hear your voice.

54:11.716 --> 54:12.848
See how it was going.

54:12.883 --> 54:14.883
It's going.

54:14.919 --> 54:17.086
Yeah? Are you ready
for the party?

54:17.121 --> 54:20.756
I hope so. How's Vermont?

54:20.791 --> 54:24.827
It's fun. We even got
a room with a hot tub.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.163
That's great.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.567
I miss you.

54:31.602 --> 54:34.737
Can I ask you something?

54:36.841 --> 54:38.173
Sure.

54:38.209 --> 54:40.976
Were you gonna
propose to me up there?

54:41.012 --> 54:44.046
Wow. You don't hold back.

54:44.081 --> 54:47.149
I just... I need to know.

54:47.184 --> 54:50.986
I feel like we've been together
for a while now, and...

54:51.022 --> 54:53.889
you know, we should be ready
to take that next step.

54:53.924 --> 54:57.793
Come on, baby, I mean,
you know I love you.

54:57.828 --> 55:01.563
I love you, too. I just...

55:01.599 --> 55:04.433
<i>I want to know that
we want the same things.</i>

55:04.468 --> 55:08.871
Come on. The water's
not getting any warmer.

55:08.906 --> 55:13.876
Uh... Evie, look,
just don't think too hard, okay?

55:13.911 --> 55:16.745
Of course we want things.

55:16.781 --> 55:19.648
It's just, um...
I gotta run right now.

55:19.684 --> 55:22.918
I-I-I will talk
to you later, okay?

55:22.953 --> 55:25.621
Okay. Bye.

55:37.335 --> 55:39.568
How long have you been
standing there?

55:44.041 --> 55:46.108
Aidan.

55:46.143 --> 55:47.509
Aidan!

55:57.088 --> 55:59.254
Aidan!

56:27.151 --> 56:29.485
<i>Wright! Why aren't you
still in your suit?</i>

56:29.520 --> 56:31.320
<i>It's only 10:30 out there.</i>

56:31.355 --> 56:34.623
I work better in pajamas.

56:34.658 --> 56:37.092
I trust things
are still going well.

56:37.128 --> 56:40.329
<i>By all accounts, perfectly.</i>

56:40.364 --> 56:44.299
If I didn't know better,
I'd say I've created
a monster.

56:44.335 --> 56:47.035
What can I say?
I learned from the best.

56:47.071 --> 56:48.604
Excuse me?

56:48.639 --> 56:51.707
I mean, I...
I didn't mean it like that.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.542
I don't think
that you're a monster.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.644
Of course you did.

56:55.679 --> 56:59.381
But I didn't get
to where I am today
by being a lapdog.

56:59.417 --> 57:05.287
Now, I don't say
what I'm about to say
with any frequency.

57:05.322 --> 57:10.192
But I promise
I'll either deny it,
blame it on wine or both.

57:10.227 --> 57:12.428
<i>But...</i>

57:12.463 --> 57:14.329
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

57:14.365 --> 57:19.134
<i>And in 20 years,</i>
<i>I expect to see you</i>
<i>exactly where I am.</i>

57:19.170 --> 57:20.269
Wow, that's...

57:20.304 --> 57:22.104
Let me finish.

57:22.139 --> 57:23.472
Sorry.

57:23.507 --> 57:26.074
I've thought hard about
your future with my company.

57:26.110 --> 57:29.645
<i>And if you pull this off
the way I know you will,</i>

57:29.680 --> 57:33.015
the west coast
office is yours.

57:34.618 --> 57:36.652
That's... really nice of you.

57:36.687 --> 57:39.188
Nice has nothing
to do with it.

57:39.223 --> 57:42.391
It's about what's
in the best interests
of my company.

57:42.426 --> 57:44.827
And the best thing for
Elizabeth Cole Events

57:44.862 --> 57:47.696
is to have Evelyn Wright
running the show out west.

57:49.533 --> 57:53.469
Elizabeth, it means a lot
to hear you say that.

57:53.504 --> 57:57.039
Well, this business
takes a lot of sacrifice.

57:57.074 --> 57:59.041
<i>But look at me.
This Christmas,</i>

57:59.076 --> 58:01.343
<i>when most people are
sitting at home by the fire,</i>

58:01.378 --> 58:04.313
wiping snot off the faces
of their little ones,

58:04.348 --> 58:06.982
I'll be on
the red eye to Aspen,

58:07.017 --> 58:11.119
<i>into the strong,
capable hands of Hans,</i>

58:11.155 --> 58:13.989
the best Swedish masseuse
in the Western Hemisphere.

58:14.024 --> 58:17.125
Clearly, you have it
all figured out.

58:17.161 --> 58:21.597
Well, we all have to decide
which choices are worth it.

58:21.632 --> 58:23.499
I did what was best for me

58:23.534 --> 58:26.034
<i>as I'm sure you will do
what is best for you.</i>

58:26.070 --> 58:28.770
<i>I don't wanna keep you.
You have work to do.</i>

58:28.806 --> 58:30.539
Ciao.

58:30.574 --> 58:35.010
<i>Oh, no. No. "Ciao" is mine.</i>

58:35.045 --> 58:38.547
<i>You can have "auf wiedersehen"
or "sayonara."</i>

58:38.582 --> 58:39.548
Au revoir?

58:39.583 --> 58:43.085
<i>Fine, okay.</i>

58:43.120 --> 58:44.753
<i>You can have "au revoir."</i>

59:29.533 --> 59:31.700
Testing 1, 2, 3.

59:45.950 --> 59:49.851
That is absolutely
beautiful, Eve.

59:49.887 --> 59:54.656
That is one of the most
beautiful things
I have ever seen.

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:18.580
What's wrong with him?
He hasn't said a word all day.

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:24.252
Oh, well.
Maybe he's just nervous.

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:41.670
Well, I don't know
what you did,

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.905
but you certainly
did a number on him.

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.841
I just want to tell him
I'm sorry.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:52.381
You know, I'm the kind of guy
who goes out there,

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:54.383
and I ask people for money.

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:57.786
I mean, anybody can do it.
I happen to be really good
at it.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:01.623
But Aidan, he looks
at a blank computer screen,

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:06.395
and he creates something
totally original, new.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:09.231
Now, that is a talent
that I envy.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.435
He's a good man.
Mm-hmm.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:16.905
And since you've been here,
I have never seen him happier.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:22.244
It's like he's suddenly excited
in our company again.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:24.212
Now it's all gone.

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:29.751
Good night, Ms. Wright.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.586
Good night, Tino.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.501
Hey, baby.
How you holding up?

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:50.939
<i>Darren, I don't think</i>
<i>things are gonna work out</i>
<i>between us.</i>

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:52.808
<i>Oh, really?</i>

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:55.444
<i>I don't think our hearts
have been in this for a while,</i>

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:57.813
<i>and I think we might be
holding each other back.</i>

01:01:57.848 --> 01:02:00.248
Oh. Don't let me
get in the way.

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:01.983
<i>I'll be home
in a couple days.</i>

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.853
<i>And I think it'd be better
if you were gone by then.</i>

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:09.558
You are
such a good boyfriend.

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:11.259
Thank you.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:26.942
Finished?
I remember you.

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:29.277
Oh, yeah?
Yes, I do.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.880
You're the girl
with the broken heart.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.648
You working here now?

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:36.585
No. I'm just helping out
for the holidays.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.988
Well, you look a lot happier
than the last time I saw you.

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.923
That was a rough night.

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.426
Oh, I hope you don't
mind me asking,

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:47.028
but I simply
adore that mural
in the front window,

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:51.767
and I was wondering if you
might put me in touch
with the artist.

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:53.902
Uh, it depends, I guess.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.905
Well, I run a small gallery
in the village.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:01.143
Could you make sure
and give them this?

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:04.579
Yes, I will.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:07.015
Many thanks. Cheers.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.518
Bye.

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:12.087
Did you hear that?

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:14.256
Girl, you are going
to the big time now!

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.192
Our own little Eve
in an art gallery.

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:19.194

You know how I sort of felt
this should've been my gig.

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:04.592

you were so subtle about it.

Thank you.
That wasn't
a compliment, Eve.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.053
You and I might have
our differences,

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:35.090

because you're different
than she is.

Fantastic party,
Ms. Wright.

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:23.231
I will have you know that
I've already received several
requests for your business card.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.334
Good. I'm glad
that everyone's
having a nice time.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:29.938
Yeah, well, you're a very
lucky lady, you know.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:34.309
You have a job that
you really love to do.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:37.278
Which I really
love to do.
A little advice.

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.180
May I?

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:45.653
Maybe you can spend
a little less time
with the centerpieces

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:49.724
and maybe
a little more time
with our host.

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:52.460
Yeah? Aidan...

01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:56.598
Al Kim is here,
and I overheard him
speaking to his assistant,

01:08:56.633 --> 01:09:01.569
saying that he thinks
Gobble is about to take off.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.872
I'll say hi to him
in a minute.
Good.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:10.178
It's gonna be a very
Merry Christmas, you two.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:14.282
Now if you'll excuse me,
I noticed some models
by the punch bowl

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:18.252
that might be interested
in some new hardware,
if you know what I mean.

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.787
How do I look?

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.890
Don't answer that.
I know.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:31.733
Um, look, I'm sorry
if you feel like
I led you on.

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:33.334
I know how it works.

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:37.337
You wanted a new client,
so you turned on the charm.

01:09:37.374 --> 01:09:40.841
That's not what this was.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:44.645
Well, congratulations.
You're gonna make your
new company a lot of money.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.749
That's not what I want.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.984
None of this
was what I wanted.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.055
I went to art school.
I wanted to paint.

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.525
I did have a boyfriend
when I came here.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:03.765
But he's unemployed
and lazy

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.869
and could care less
about any of this, so...

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:10.338
Well, it sounds like
he doesn't deserve you.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:15.877
I'm the one that
doesn't deserve you.

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:19.480
And the truth is that
this is the happiest I've
been in a really long time,

01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:23.651
and it has nothing to do
with the job or the party.

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:24.886
It's you.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:30.692
I want another chance,
and not as your client.

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:33.528
What about your boyfriend?

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.532
I called him
last night.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.567
It's over.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:44.239
Is that the truth?

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:47.775

for coming out tonight.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:52.280

a big shout-out to my girl
and my sorority sister

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.383

putting this all together.

surprise for everyone.

I want you to leave!

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:44.071

in our apartment.

<i>I kicked him out.</i>

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:49.544

01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:53.014
Yup. It's over.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.616
<i>It wasn't really the most
pleasant way to end it, but...</i>

01:15:55.652 --> 01:15:58.853
I feel like he did me a favor
by getting caught.

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:02.156
You did what
you should've done
a long time ago,

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:03.858
and I'm proud of you, girl.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.560
<i>For real.</i>

01:16:05.595 --> 01:16:06.827
Thanks.

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:09.864
Now you can get

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:13.000
Who?
<i>You know who I'm</i>
<i>talking about.</i>

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:16.604
That beautiful man in LA
who wants to jump your bones.

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:21.142
I abandoned him on
the most important night
of his life.

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:23.611
I'll be lucky
if he doesn't sue me.

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:28.683
Well, I saw the way he looked at
you the first time you two met.

01:16:28.718 --> 01:16:31.085
No one's ever looked
at me like that.

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:34.255
<i>See you soon, okay?</i>

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:35.756
Okay.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:57.204
Eve, is everything
okay, love?

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.009
Have you ever had an experience
that you thought was real,
but it was just a dream?

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:03.978
Well, not since the 70s.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.714
It's Christmas.

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:09.950
Don't you have
somewhere else to be?

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:12.386
I don't know.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.024
Maybe.

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:08.042
Hey, it's, um...

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.144
Aidan Green...

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:13.881
who you left heartbroken
in Los Angeles when
you missed your plane.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.083
How'd you find me?

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:18.586
Your friend the bartender.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:22.857
She also showed me
the painting you made.

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:24.425
Very, very nice.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:28.395
Thank you.
What are you doing here?

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:34.235
Well, after the party
was a complete disaster...

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:38.873
Thank you for missing it,
by the way, and sending
your crazy, crazy boss...

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:41.942
I'm sorry.
She fired me.

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:45.079
I needed to to get away.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:49.383
And I love this city
in the winter.
It's perfect.

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:51.819
You do not
get that in LA.

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:58.526
How impressively impulsive.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:02.263
Slightly out of character,
but what the heck?

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:06.400
People say amazing things
happen every day in New York.

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:08.135
Something told me
I should be here.

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:11.005
So the party
didn't go well, huh?

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.573
I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:14.153
I didn't want to be
the next Facebook anyway.

01:20:14.177 --> 01:20:16.277
I want to be
the first Gobble.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.979
I'm just sorry that we
didn't have an opportunity
to work together.

01:20:19.015 --> 01:20:23.050
You know, I missed that flight
by about ten seconds.

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:24.985
Seriously?

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:29.456
Ten seconds was the difference
of me being out there with you,

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:33.561
doing the party and probably
getting a big promotion.

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:37.832
I'm a big believer
that things happen
for a reason.

01:20:37.867 --> 01:20:41.001
So instead of a big promotion
and a fancy new client,

01:20:41.037 --> 01:20:44.471
I was supposed to lose my job,
get a job bartending,

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:46.574
show my art
at a small gallery,

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:49.009
and catch my boyfriend
cheating on me.

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:50.244
Can't forget that one.

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:52.713
If it's meant to be.

01:20:52.748 --> 01:20:56.917
Maybe you were meant
to be a great artist.

01:20:56.953 --> 01:21:01.956
Maybe you were
with the wrong guy.

01:21:01.991 --> 01:21:06.227
I don't suppose
I could interest you
in a bite to eat,

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:07.828
maybe a hot cocoa?

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:09.763
A guy that drinks
hot cocoa, huh?

01:21:09.799 --> 01:21:14.668
I'm just... I am...
I am freezing right now!

01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:17.838
I really should've
packed more layers.

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:21.075
Come on, what do you say?

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:30.751
You know,
there's a rule about that.

01:21:30.786 --> 01:21:33.354
You did that on purpose,
didn't you?

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.689
Maybe.

01:21:36.305 --> 01:21:42.153
