WEBVTT

00:58.767 --> 01:02.729
…deeply saddened
to report that our own Isabelle Carrick

01:02.813 --> 01:07.985
was pronounced dead on the scene this
evening at the age of 28. A rising star--

01:10.112 --> 01:11.321
Are you all right?

01:12.656 --> 01:13.657
No.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.162
What was that, Leanne?

01:21.206 --> 01:22.833
I thought that you'd understand.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.132
A colleague of mine was just killed,
and you…

01:32.342 --> 01:34.887
seemed pleased.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.389
Isabelle wanted to hurt you.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.642
She was never going to stop
trying to hurt you.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.270
I wanted to help.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.607
"Help"?

01:49.651 --> 01:50.861
Help how?

02:01.288 --> 02:02.289
I'm sorry.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.588
You guys are leaving already?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.717
Kourtney's not feeling very well.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.094
I'll wait in the car.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.474
I'm so sorry about tonight.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.852
There's nothing to apologize for,
sweetheart.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.729
I'm just glad that you're safe.

02:25.812 --> 02:30.275
I was hoping we could continue
the conversation we were having earlier.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.987
Yes, we will talk about
your nanny situation this week.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.074
Right now you should get some sleep.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.827
Yeah. Give your back a rest.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.688
Hey.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.107
Where are your drugs?

03:10.774 --> 03:13.443
I threw 'em away, you junkie.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.528
Why?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.866
As soon as I start, I'll never stop.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.202
I wanted them.

03:22.953 --> 03:27.332
Well, trust me,
they won't help you in the slightest.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.465
What?

03:44.183 --> 03:45.392
Take off your pants.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.269
What?

03:48.437 --> 03:49.438
Now?

03:50.105 --> 03:51.607
Everyone's asleep already.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.493
Biltong and caviar?

04:45.577 --> 04:47.621
I was just gonna have some coffee.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.546
Please sit.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.442
Let me hold him while you eat.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.278
He's better with me.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.326
-Can we talk?
-About what?

05:27.202 --> 05:28.328
Last night.

05:29.621 --> 05:30.956
What is there to say?

05:32.875 --> 05:36.420
Dorothy, what is it going to take
for you to stop icing me out?

05:37.588 --> 05:40.591
You know exactly what, and you've
made it very clear where you stand.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.719
With you, Dorothy. Always.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.025
Do you have work today?

05:59.318 --> 06:02.404
Yeah, we're shooting the judgment panels
all night, so I'll be back late.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.072
But I could have them reschedule.

06:04.156 --> 06:08.035
No. God, don't do that.
Working in TV's no joke, Sean.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.246
You gotta grab the bull by the horns
and not let go.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.209
What are you doing?

06:18.587 --> 06:19.671
I'm reading.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.673
About what?

06:22.299 --> 06:25.052
Let me hold him while you
take a shower and change.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.678
I'm right here.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.681
No. I can't eat this.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.060
It took me hours.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.028
Don't eat that crap.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.742
Milk? No?

06:52.996 --> 06:53.997
What's wrong?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.627
What the hell?

06:58.710 --> 06:59.837
Think it went down my throat.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.630
You eat any of those?

07:01.713 --> 07:03.257
I felt it move in my mouth.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.341
Did you swallow?

09:25.357 --> 09:26.441
Leanne?

09:29.820 --> 09:31.446
Did you have a nice run?

09:32.155 --> 09:33.156
Yes.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.493
Would you mind coming with me
for a minute?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.537
You look so cute in my dungarees,

09:38.620 --> 09:40.998
I thought maybe we could find you
something else.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.253
Leanne.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.883
How did you get these?

09:57.806 --> 09:59.433
I used to punish myself.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.979
We were supposed to be perfect.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.984
No wicked thoughts, no selfishness.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.279
Only service to him.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.908
Last night,

10:16.950 --> 10:20.078
when you said you wanted to help…

10:22.497 --> 10:26.335
do you somehow blame yourself
for what happened to Isabelle?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.257
I don't wanna see you hurting yourself,

10:32.341 --> 10:36.178
and I just want to understand
what you believe.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.721
That's all.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.641
You don't need to worry.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.226
No?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.521
I don't hurt myself anymore.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.190
I don't follow their rules.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.109
I get to decide now.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.739
That must feel good.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.534
Yeah.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.538
Look how cute you look.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.042
I wanna get a picture with my girl. Yep.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.671
Here.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.017
Let me see.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.083
This is Frank Pearce. Leave me a message.

11:48.834 --> 11:52.296
Hi, Dad.
Please call me as soon as you get this.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.547
Thank you.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.216
Fuck.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.763
This is Frank Pearce.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.511
Dorothy, it's 2:00 in the morning.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.346
Dad, I'm so sorry.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.556
I was trying to reach you all night.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.645
Are you there?

12:52.189 --> 12:54.191
I'm sorry, Dad. I have to call you back.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.416
Are you still in touch
with Dale Mackenzie?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.293
What?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.546
Your doctor friend.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.633
Sure. Dale and I play
pickleball together every Tuesday.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.011
Great. I'd like you to send him
to the house for an appointment.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.973
If you think it would be helpful,

13:26.056 --> 13:28.308
I would be happy to make any arrangement--

13:28.392 --> 13:32.896
He can interview Leanne, and then he can
sign the petition for her commitment.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.857
You're serious about that?

13:34.940 --> 13:36.984
Yes. I have done the research.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.153
She presents a clear and present danger
to herself and to others.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.613
She is clinically insane.

13:41.697 --> 13:44.241
She cannot distinguish
fantasy from reality.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.869
Highly manipulative. Self-mutilates.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.203
Now, I don't know

13:48.287 --> 13:51.039
if this is a chemical imbalance
or some cult brainwashing,

13:51.123 --> 13:53.458
but whatever it is, she's gotta go.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.086
And then everything will be okay.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.255
I'm gonna send you the photos.

13:58.338 --> 14:03.135
If you could make the appointment,
I can talk Leanne into doing it.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.225
I will call Dale in the morning.

14:10.309 --> 14:11.685
Great. Talk soon.

14:24.114 --> 14:27.993
Okay. Here we go.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.620
Yeah.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.705
Does that feel good?

14:38.086 --> 14:43.050
You know, Sean and I did
some couples therapy a few years back.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.761
It honestly changed our lives.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.596
How?

14:48.472 --> 14:52.476
Well, there was a lot of friction
back then,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.186
me being the breadwinner.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.689
And, you know, back then I was always
trying so hard to please everyone,

14:57.773 --> 14:59.358
get every little thing just right.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.528
But that's the way you are now.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.239
It's a lifelong process.

15:07.449 --> 15:11.537
It takes a long time to recover
from the kind of childhood you've had.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.623
Have you ever talked to anyone about it?

15:16.375 --> 15:18.252
I don't know if I want to change.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.840
Well, what if you and I did it together?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.885
I've been thinking a lot about us,
you and me.

15:29.263 --> 15:33.767
I really wanna understand you
so we can be close again.

15:35.561 --> 15:36.770
We can do it together?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.026
Sure.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.408
Okay.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.834
Hush, little baby
Don't say a word

16:42.002 --> 16:45.756
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

16:47.382 --> 16:51.428
And if that mockingbird won't sing

16:52.346 --> 16:55.224
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

16:57.100 --> 17:00.938
And if that diamond ring turns brass

17:02.147 --> 17:05.567
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass

17:06.944 --> 17:11.156
And if that looking glass gets broke

17:12.532 --> 17:16.494
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat

17:32.261 --> 17:33.262
Hello, Dorothy.

17:33.345 --> 17:37.057
Dr. Mackenzie, thank you so much
for coming. Please come in.

17:40.811 --> 17:41.979
Is this all right?

17:43.021 --> 17:45.148
I was thinking it would be
the most private.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.567
This will do just fine.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.871
Here she is.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.332
Leanne, meet Dr. Mackenzie.

18:02.416 --> 18:03.750
Pleased to meet you, Leanne.

18:04.585 --> 18:05.586
Hello.

18:06.253 --> 18:11.633
Now, I believe Dr. Mackenzie wanted
to start by speaking with us individually.

18:11.717 --> 18:12.843
Isn't that right?

18:12.926 --> 18:14.845
I thought we were doing this together.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.099
Well, this way you can speak freely,
Leanne.

18:19.183 --> 18:21.560
About you, about me.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.188
You don't have to worry about anything.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.772
Right?

18:25.856 --> 18:27.065
That's right, Dorothy.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.948
Would you like to take a seat, Leanne?

18:48.003 --> 18:49.838
What are you doing here?

18:49.922 --> 18:51.131
What are you doing here?

18:51.632 --> 18:52.841
Tidying up.

18:54.551 --> 18:55.969
Is--

18:56.053 --> 18:57.721
Is Sean around?

18:59.097 --> 19:00.182
He's at work.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.936
Maybe you're here to see Leanne?

19:06.772 --> 19:09.149
I asked you for the most basic
kind of loyalty.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.693
To stop fucking the woman
who's ruining my life.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.404
In my own house, on my patio!

19:17.241 --> 19:18.617
I don't know how to stop.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.662
You don't understand who she is.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.872
I understand that girl
better than any of you.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.001
I think it would be best for everyone
if you could just find a way

19:28.085 --> 19:29.503
to make peace with Leanne.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.090
Why are you both so afraid of her?
What is wrong with you?

19:33.173 --> 19:34.466
Just let me talk to her.

19:34.550 --> 19:35.759
Well, you can't

19:35.843 --> 19:38.262
because she's in the office
talking to Dale Mackenzie.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.430
What? Dad's friend?

19:40.514 --> 19:42.307
Yes, he's doing an assessment.

19:42.391 --> 19:45.143
That guy's an asshole. What were you
thinking going to Dad for this?

19:45.227 --> 19:46.979
Well, at least he's not fucking my nanny!

19:47.062 --> 19:49.314
No, but give it a minute.

19:49.398 --> 19:52.067
If you ever want me to trust you again,
you will leave this house

19:52.150 --> 19:53.777
and let me do this my way!

19:56.738 --> 19:57.865
Fine.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.701
Do it your way, but this is a big mistake.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.665
Hey, it's Sean. Leave a message.

20:06.748 --> 20:11.044
Sean, you need to get here now.
It is raining shit. Call me.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.600
I thought maybe you'd be finishing up.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.811
How was it?

20:27.895 --> 20:28.896
Good.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.856
I think it's your turn.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.945
I don't know how you managed
all that with her,

20:37.029 --> 20:41.700
but she doesn't seem
defensive or threatened in any way.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.661
So you're clearly very good at this.

20:45.913 --> 20:47.789
Would you like to set him down?

20:48.498 --> 20:49.791
No. He's fine.

20:50.918 --> 20:52.961
So, did you get everything you need?

20:53.045 --> 20:56.798
Almost. I have all of your notes
from your dad.

20:57.591 --> 21:00.886
I just needed a bit more background,
if you don't mind.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.515
Well,

21:05.390 --> 21:08.727
I don't know if she's told you
some of the things she's told me.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.772
And the delusions.

21:13.565 --> 21:17.194
Believe me, I am frightened
about what she might do next.

21:18.362 --> 21:20.906
And Sean and Julian, they don't get it.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.450
They continue to enable her pathology.

21:23.534 --> 21:25.953
And she has completely manipulated them.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.830
She is like this little worm
that just gets under your skin

21:28.914 --> 21:32.167
and eats its way
all the way to your heart!

21:37.297 --> 21:38.549
Thank you.

21:39.383 --> 21:40.467
Thank you.

21:40.551 --> 21:43.595
It's so nice to have someone
who will finally listen to me.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.896
I am so sorry. I don't know what the fuck
she was thinking calling him in.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.815
Hey. It's okay.

21:55.941 --> 21:57.442
Dorothy was just trying to help.

21:58.735 --> 22:02.489
Yeah, well, Dorothy's version
of helping usually--

22:06.577 --> 22:07.744
It's Milo's.

22:08.787 --> 22:09.997
It was out front.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.333
We can't find him anywhere.

22:19.131 --> 22:20.257
Thank you.

22:22.968 --> 22:25.971
Well, thank you so much for stopping by.

22:35.314 --> 22:37.399
I hope we didn't take up
too much of your time.

22:37.482 --> 22:38.692
Not at all.

22:38.775 --> 22:39.902
Okay.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.661
Dad?

22:51.079 --> 22:52.789
I didn't know you were stopping by.

22:54.583 --> 22:58.712
Well, shall we have a little chat?

23:01.006 --> 23:02.674
Now? Yes.

23:05.010 --> 23:08.597
Well, there's some coffee in the kitchen.
I'll go fetch Leanne.

23:09.139 --> 23:12.476
Dorothy, your father has expressed
his concerns to me

23:12.559 --> 23:14.770
about the volatile situation
in this house.

23:14.853 --> 23:15.854
Okay.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.524
His primary concern
is keeping his grandson safe.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.360
Yes, of course.
This is all about what's best for Jericho.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.111
-Leanne?
-Leanne is not the person

23:23.195 --> 23:25.030
I was sent here to evaluate today.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.035
Come again?

23:31.203 --> 23:34.790
We're concerned about you.
About your well-being.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.709
Dad?

23:38.210 --> 23:39.211
Hey.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.799
-What are you doing home?
-Julian called. He said some--

23:43.882 --> 23:45.425
Does someone wanna tell me
what's going on?

23:45.509 --> 23:47.511
Frank and I are having
a private discussion with Dorothy.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.638
-Give us a minute.
-Dorothy, what's happening?

23:49.721 --> 23:51.557
I have no idea.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.100
Leanne?

23:54.017 --> 23:56.728
Dottie, you're not sleeping.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.939
You won't let anyone touch the baby.

23:59.022 --> 24:02.192
The condition you're in right now
is simply not safe for you or Jericho.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.027
-Hold on a minute.
-Let him finish, Sean.

24:04.111 --> 24:07.239
Furthermore, you seem to have developed
a paranoid fixation

24:07.322 --> 24:10.409
-on the young woman who lives with you.
-Paranoid fixation?

24:11.034 --> 24:13.036
She mutilates herself.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.872
She took my baby!

24:14.955 --> 24:17.291
You tell him, tell him!

24:17.374 --> 24:19.668
Tell him the truth. She is unwell.

24:19.751 --> 24:22.921
Listen to yourself, sweetheart.
You're falling apart.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.673
Julian was right.

24:24.756 --> 24:25.841
Asshole.

24:25.924 --> 24:30.053
And you, I trusted you
to do the right thing for once!

24:30.137 --> 24:34.016
All we want is for you to go someplace
where you can rest.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.726
-Dad! Jesus!
-What the hell does that mean?

24:35.809 --> 24:38.187
Please let me explain.
I am legally required

24:38.270 --> 24:40.314
to report any situation
where a child is in danger.

24:40.397 --> 24:42.816
-You pickleballed fuck!
-Good to see you, Julian.

24:42.900 --> 24:46.069
I asked Dale not to go through the court
on this.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.696
But if you're not
going to accept treatment--

24:47.779 --> 24:49.823
-Don't threaten her!
-If Dorothy refuses help,

24:49.907 --> 24:53.035
-I have no choice but to go to Child--
-It's for her own good, Sean.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.578
We all know what happened before.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.039
You handled it your way,
now I'm handling it mine.

24:57.122 --> 24:59.249
Now hold on. Shut up!
Dorothy's under a lot of strain.

24:59.333 --> 25:02.544
This is wrong.
This is way the fuck wrong, Frank!

25:05.130 --> 25:06.423
Sean's right.

25:08.509 --> 25:12.387
We can all support Dorothy's recovery
from right here at home.

25:14.181 --> 25:18.727
Separating her and Jericho now
would just be cruel for both of them.

25:21.230 --> 25:23.857
Dorothy is an amazing mom.

25:25.067 --> 25:27.903
She is what holds
this whole family together.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.822
She's taught me so much.

25:32.199 --> 25:34.451
And Jericho is not in any danger.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.413
Dorothy has no problem
letting me hold him. Do you?

25:39.498 --> 25:42.084
Remember when we were all playing
in the backyard yesterday?

25:42.709 --> 25:43.877
Should we show them?

25:45.170 --> 25:46.171
Here.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.843
Thank you, Leanne.

25:53.345 --> 25:54.596
Hi.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.056
Ready?

26:04.273 --> 26:05.274
See?

26:06.441 --> 26:11.488
Dad, I can move in full time to help out.
We're not gonna let anything happen.

26:11.572 --> 26:13.949
Yeah. We're all right here for her.

26:14.032 --> 26:17.119
If you all understand the commitment
you'd be making,

26:17.202 --> 26:19.538
to watch Dorothy closely,
to help her get some rest.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.331
I'd be comfortable trying it out.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.334
Thank you.

26:25.085 --> 26:27.129
I don't know how the two of you
let things get so bad.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.131
-Go fuck yourself, Dad.
-Perfect.

26:29.214 --> 26:32.009
I'm writing her a prescription
for Trazodone.

26:33.677 --> 26:38.473
I've got a sample pack to tide her over
until you get that filled.

26:38.557 --> 26:42.060
Why don't you take these right now?
It'll help you get some sleep.

26:55.574 --> 26:56.575
Good girl.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.202
Come on. Let's go sit down.

27:05.542 --> 27:09.171
Hush little baby
Don't say a word

27:09.713 --> 27:13.342
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

27:14.343 --> 27:18.680
And if that mockingbird won't sing

27:19.306 --> 27:23.519
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

27:24.770 --> 27:28.899
And if that diamond ring turns brass

27:29.608 --> 27:33.362
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass

27:34.321 --> 27:38.492
And if that looking glass gets broke

27:39.243 --> 27:42.913
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat

27:43.789 --> 27:47.626
And if that billy goat doesn't pull

27:48.460 --> 27:52.506
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull
