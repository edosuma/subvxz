42:46.143 --> 42:48.974
The minute our infected server
gets back on the main network,

42:48.999 --> 42:51.980
we're set. It wasn't me.

42:52.032 --> 42:57.619
The whole time, it wasn't
really me doing all of that.

42:57.654 --> 43:02.791
Elliot, the reasons we wanted to do this,

43:02.826 --> 43:05.126
the reasons why we all wanted to do this,

43:05.162 --> 43:08.010
are real.

43:08.035 --> 43:12.537
Maybe you don't realize
this, but this was your idea.

43:12.562 --> 43:16.231
You came up with this.

43:16.256 --> 43:19.368
There is a part of you.
Somewhere deep down inside,

43:19.393 --> 43:22.727
that knows this is the right thing to do.

43:26.635 --> 43:28.493
I'm gonna get your meds.

43:28.518 --> 43:30.685
We'll talk more when I get back, okay?

43:35.643 --> 43:37.655
Come on.

Shh.

44:23.785 --> 44:27.411
I've been waiting outside
your apartment until she left.

44:27.436 --> 44:30.604
Didn't want anyone to know I'm here.

44:30.629 --> 44:32.579
I know you're behind it,

44:32.604 --> 44:36.705
all of it, F Society, the server,

44:36.730 --> 44:39.088
Colby, Allsafe.

44:39.113 --> 44:42.564
You're the one constant

Elliot...

44:54.223 --> 44:58.634
now, I don't know what your grand plan is,

44:58.659 --> 45:00.942
but I need to, and you're going to tell me.

45:11.971 --> 45:17.808
Two days ago I strangled a woman
to death just with my hands.

45:17.833 --> 45:20.801
That's a strange sensation.

45:25.458 --> 45:27.375
Something so tremendous done

45:27.400 --> 45:30.401
by something so simple.

45:33.150 --> 45:38.187
The first ten seconds
were... uncomfortable,

45:38.212 --> 45:40.846
a feeling of limbo,

45:40.871 --> 45:42.831
but then your muscles tense,

45:42.856 --> 45:46.321
and she struggles and fights,

45:46.373 --> 45:48.323
but it almost disappears in the background

45:48.375 --> 45:52.961
along with everything else in the world.

45:52.996 --> 45:58.666
At that moment it's just
you and absolute power,

45:58.668 --> 46:03.400
nothing else.

46:03.425 --> 46:05.792
That moment stayed with me.

46:11.017 --> 46:14.852
I thought I'd feel guilty
for being a murderer,

46:14.877 --> 46:19.496
but... I don't.

46:19.521 --> 46:21.854
I feel wonder.
