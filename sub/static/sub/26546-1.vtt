02:47.323 --> 02:49.724
And now,
my puppets are re-enacting

02:49.726 --> 02:54.428
David's great victory
before your lovely eyes.

02:54.430 --> 02:57.032
Hey, it's about
your old man, David.

02:57.034 --> 03:00.200
I'm sick of people
going on all the time

03:00.202 --> 03:01.836
about how great my dad was.

03:01.838 --> 03:04.709
Well, we could do
something about it.

03:05.309 --> 03:06.607
Huh?

03:06.609 --> 03:10.378
Oh.
The donkey will forgive us.

03:10.380 --> 03:13.848
Don't be so scared.
Look up, it's me.

03:13.850 --> 03:15.116
You're...

03:15.118 --> 03:17.485
Tobby, the King's fox?

03:17.487 --> 03:21.155
You don't say.
Listen, I've got a job for you.

03:23.626 --> 03:26.194
That'll cause
total chaos.

03:26.196 --> 03:27.796
I don't know.

03:27.798 --> 03:29.998
That's a royal fox command.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.737
And you'll squash me
if I refuse?

03:33.036 --> 03:33.971
Mmm-hmm.

03:50.087 --> 03:51.221
Not again!

03:57.226 --> 03:58.960
Ow!

04:00.930 --> 04:04.298
Hey, help me, you two-legged
excuse for a King.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.534
Do you hear me?

04:06.536 --> 04:10.137
Edom's proud people,
thought that they would win

04:10.139 --> 04:12.006
and thus felt pretty safe.

04:12.008 --> 04:15.743
But King David took a shine
to their garden's green,

04:15.745 --> 04:17.779
and attacked their land.

04:17.781 --> 04:20.781
The King of Edom could
no longer defend his land

04:20.784 --> 04:23.517
and his son, Hadad, disappeared.

04:23.519 --> 04:25.953
Who knows where he was last seen

04:25.955 --> 04:27.822
as all this happened
in the past.

04:27.824 --> 04:29.823
Hey, puppet master.

04:29.825 --> 04:32.794
Are you telling
that same old story again?

04:32.796 --> 04:35.496
Your Highness.
Your father, King David?

04:35.498 --> 04:38.366
Yes, I know.
It's just that it's getting...

04:38.368 --> 04:40.234
Ah, how can I say it,

04:40.236 --> 04:41.702
a bit boring.

04:41.704 --> 04:43.438
And what about my stories?

04:43.440 --> 04:44.972
Come on, not again.

04:44.974 --> 04:48.142
- Well...
- Like that time when I ordered the sheep.

04:48.144 --> 04:51.212
Let me tell you how to tell a
good story with your puppets.

04:51.214 --> 04:52.683
Your Highness, no!

04:54.183 --> 04:55.883
Kinglet, help!

04:55.885 --> 04:57.320
Kinglet. A little help!

05:08.264 --> 05:09.767
Solomon!

05:14.370 --> 05:15.602
Is that kid,

05:15.604 --> 05:17.972
the son of merciless David,

05:17.974 --> 05:20.774
who destroyed the city
of my birth?

05:20.776 --> 05:23.611
He's an unruly, young renegade.

05:23.613 --> 05:26.017
But this might be
my last chance.

05:29.051 --> 05:31.885
I was given something sticky
only yesterday.

05:31.887 --> 05:35.123
I bet Solomon shoved it
into your beak, didn't he?

05:35.125 --> 05:38.359
That's how he gets rid
of sweets he doesn't like.

05:39.462 --> 05:40.861
Look out.

05:40.863 --> 05:43.363
Here comes the Chief Adviser.

05:43.365 --> 05:46.370
Everyone out.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.344
So what was all
the commotion about,

05:57.346 --> 05:58.880
Your Highness?

05:58.882 --> 06:02.250
We were just having
a bit of fun, Jehoshafat.

06:02.252 --> 06:03.185
Sire,

06:03.187 --> 06:06.488
that animal got you
into trouble again.

06:06.490 --> 06:08.089
But that's what Tobby's like.

06:08.091 --> 06:11.525
It's not his fault.
He's 100% fox.

06:11.527 --> 06:14.195
Your dear father
always took my advice

06:14.197 --> 06:19.200
and that's why he was able to
leave you such a wonderful land.

06:19.202 --> 06:22.469
He was so busy with it that
he never took notice of me.

06:22.471 --> 06:27.575
At least have respect
for the ring your father gave you.

06:27.577 --> 06:30.077
The ring represents
your royal power

06:30.079 --> 06:34.849
and these statues were created
by your loyal people.

06:34.851 --> 06:37.185
You are nothing without them.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.253
I am the King.

06:39.255 --> 06:41.923
Who needs to go and get ready.

06:41.925 --> 06:44.525
The Queen of Sheba
could be here at any moment.

06:44.527 --> 06:47.462
Bilqis! So you invited her
after all?

06:47.464 --> 06:49.731
Your kingdom must have a queen.

06:49.733 --> 06:52.233
But I don't wanna marry her.

06:52.235 --> 06:55.139
You are a king
and you have duties.

06:56.839 --> 06:58.972
Oh! They're here already.

06:58.974 --> 07:01.008
Quick, we need to prepare.

07:19.495 --> 07:21.061
Are we here so soon?

07:21.063 --> 07:23.263
So soon? But we've been

07:23.265 --> 07:25.866
traveling for the last
two months, My Queen.

07:25.868 --> 07:28.368
But, Nanny, if I have
to win Solomon's heart,

07:28.370 --> 07:31.207
I need plenty of time
to get my make up right.

07:31.942 --> 07:34.274
True love needs no make up.

07:34.276 --> 07:35.609
Oh, Hana.

07:35.611 --> 07:37.779
Girls today are only interested

07:37.781 --> 07:40.317
in what brand of camel
a boy is riding.

07:48.757 --> 07:50.758
They say that Solomon is wise.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.560
Wise?

07:52.562 --> 07:54.863
And terribly wealthy.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.268
Now, that sounds more like it.

08:28.330 --> 08:31.167
All right,
but use a bit of perfume.

08:33.570 --> 08:37.241
If he turns his nose, I'll
give him a good punch on it.

08:38.207 --> 08:41.910
Listen.
What's that silence?

08:49.485 --> 08:51.054
You can go now.

09:00.729 --> 09:01.998
Wow!

09:10.573 --> 09:14.042
I mean... Wow!

09:14.044 --> 09:16.144
Listen, you don't happen to know

09:16.146 --> 09:18.746
where I can find
the local King, do you?

09:18.748 --> 09:21.886
- Uh-huh.
- We were supposed to meet up here.

09:22.752 --> 09:24.351
Uh-huh.

09:24.353 --> 09:26.821
- Psst.
- Hmm?

09:26.823 --> 09:28.789
What is it, Nanny?

09:28.791 --> 09:30.958
It's him. It's Solomon.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.627
- You?
- Uh-huh.

09:35.665 --> 09:39.833
No! My girlfriends are gonna tear
me to pieces when I get home.

09:39.835 --> 09:43.438
So then, that must
mean you're Bilqis.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.539
Uh, like, yeah.

09:45.541 --> 09:48.112
Mmm. You smell good.

09:52.181 --> 09:54.115
Sorry about the nose thing.

09:54.117 --> 09:55.616
A pretty good punch for a girl.

09:55.618 --> 09:58.653
Hello, Kinglet,
this is the stuffing calling.

09:58.655 --> 09:59.953
C'mom, let's get out of here.

09:59.955 --> 10:01.856
You want me to leave her side.

10:01.858 --> 10:04.358
No way, just look
how lovely she is.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.028
Don't tell me
you fancy a puppet like her.

10:07.030 --> 10:08.129
Will you shut up.

10:08.131 --> 10:09.764
Are you talking to me?

10:09.766 --> 10:11.798
Oh no, I was talking to my fox.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.436
If I told my girlfriends back
home that you talk to foxes...

10:22.145 --> 10:24.515
Oh, you're a darling thing.

10:26.148 --> 10:27.814
Don't be afraid, sweetie.

10:27.816 --> 10:29.652
I'll look after you.

10:31.787 --> 10:33.254
Please wait.

10:33.256 --> 10:35.990
Your eyes are as tame as...

10:35.992 --> 10:38.826
...the flapping wings of a dove.

10:38.828 --> 10:40.127
Oh, don't bother.

10:40.129 --> 10:42.864
Why don't you tell me
about your father instead?

10:42.866 --> 10:44.332
About my father?

10:44.334 --> 10:46.100
They reckon he was a cool guy.

10:46.102 --> 10:49.202
He even sent the demons to hell.

10:49.204 --> 10:52.673
So you don't think I'd be capable
of hunting down a demon?

10:52.675 --> 10:54.241
I'd believe it if I saw it.

10:54.243 --> 10:58.513
I've still not seen what kind of sacrifice
you'd be willing to make for me.

10:58.515 --> 10:59.813
Anything!

10:59.815 --> 11:01.848
Well, if you gave me your fox,

11:01.850 --> 11:04.184
I might be willing
to believe you.

11:04.186 --> 11:06.453
Its fur would look
really good around my neck.

11:06.455 --> 11:09.592
What? You can forget that.

11:11.161 --> 11:13.895
I want to be taken home
this minute.

11:13.897 --> 11:15.797
Please! Bilqis, wait.

11:15.799 --> 11:20.168
If you prove that you are really
as wise as they say you are,

11:20.170 --> 11:22.904
then perhaps, maybe.

11:22.906 --> 11:25.972
Oh, Kinglet,
don't let her tempt you.

11:32.982 --> 11:35.949
King Solomon,

11:35.951 --> 11:39.553
is about to display
his infinite wisdom.

11:39.555 --> 11:43.457
Queen Bilqis is going to ask
the first question.

11:46.695 --> 11:51.499
Here are a hundred roses
from the gardens of Sheba.

11:51.501 --> 11:55.937
Only one is real and the others
are stitched from silk.

11:55.939 --> 11:58.308
Can you tell me
which is the real one?

11:59.709 --> 12:00.743
Hmm.

12:03.246 --> 12:04.180
Hmm?

12:24.600 --> 12:27.802
This is the only rose
that grew from the ground

12:27.804 --> 12:29.136
and not on the loom.

12:29.138 --> 12:31.808
Beginner's luck.

12:32.608 --> 12:34.578
Move aside, let me pass.

12:38.314 --> 12:41.682
Now you are going to answer
the question that I pose.

12:41.684 --> 12:45.586
So, King, when will you
give me back my ring?

12:46.723 --> 12:48.021
Who are you?

12:48.023 --> 12:49.890
And what ring
are you talking about?

12:49.892 --> 12:51.659
My name's Hadad.

12:51.661 --> 12:53.361
And I come from Edom,

12:53.363 --> 12:56.164
that David destroyed
with fire and steel

12:56.166 --> 12:58.933
when I was only a child.

12:58.935 --> 13:01.068
You mean, my father?

13:01.070 --> 13:04.438
He is the one who stole
my father's ring,

13:04.440 --> 13:06.640
leveled my city to the ground

13:06.642 --> 13:10.244
and sent me off
into poverty and suffering.

13:10.246 --> 13:12.279
But, there's peace now.

13:12.281 --> 13:15.116
There will be no peace
until you return

13:15.118 --> 13:16.983
my father's ring to me.

13:16.985 --> 13:19.986
What ring are you talking about?

13:19.988 --> 13:21.389
The one on your finger.

13:21.391 --> 13:24.424
I swear that
I will only find peace

13:24.426 --> 13:27.127
when I have
the ring on my finger.

13:28.064 --> 13:30.097
You were taught to hate,

13:30.099 --> 13:32.667
so no good can live
in your heart.

13:32.669 --> 13:34.000
I came here today

13:34.002 --> 13:36.102
to offer you peace, Solomon.

13:36.104 --> 13:39.740
But you are as cruel
as your father was.

13:39.742 --> 13:41.411
Vengeance will be mine.

13:55.992 --> 13:58.525
You have slighted me, Solomon.

13:58.527 --> 14:04.600
And so, I curse you and
your people for all eternity.

14:10.706 --> 14:14.945
I call you, demon.
I summon you, evil one.

14:20.315 --> 14:23.284
Appear now
from the darkest deep.

14:23.286 --> 14:25.819
Come forth, as you wake...

14:25.821 --> 14:28.392
from sleep.

14:28.757 --> 14:30.426
Aah!

14:31.326 --> 14:34.127
I free you now
from eternal night.

14:34.129 --> 14:37.868
Come forth
and step into the light.

14:40.536 --> 14:43.306
Asmodeus, you are here at last.

14:43.739 --> 14:45.206
Who are you?

14:45.208 --> 14:46.810
Mortal fool.

14:47.676 --> 14:49.809
I am the one
who summoned you forth

14:49.811 --> 14:52.779
and cut a path
to the center of the Earth.

14:53.749 --> 14:55.548
I can't hold Edom.

14:55.550 --> 14:58.351
Expect no gratitude from me.

14:58.353 --> 15:01.054
I am the demon of hatred.

15:01.056 --> 15:02.823
One look from me

15:02.825 --> 15:05.558
and brothers go
for each others' throats.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.862
I sigh, and evil fills the air.

15:08.864 --> 15:12.366
Hatred follows
closely in my traps.

15:12.368 --> 15:14.501
I can see
that it's a long while

15:14.503 --> 15:18.338
since you walked on Earth.
The world has changed a lot.

15:18.340 --> 15:21.274
But I can be of assistance
to you if you...

15:21.276 --> 15:24.544
Do you dare
bargain with me, maggot?

15:24.546 --> 15:28.082
Revenge, I only want revenge.

15:28.084 --> 15:31.519
Revenge? I like
the sound of that.

15:31.521 --> 15:32.285
On whom?

15:32.287 --> 15:34.054
On the King of Jerusalem.

15:34.056 --> 15:36.156
On David, who imprisoned me?

15:36.158 --> 15:37.625
David is dead.

15:37.627 --> 15:42.063
Now his son, Solomon,
wears my father's ring.

15:42.065 --> 15:43.864
Help me get it back.

15:45.133 --> 15:50.004
David is dead? I can still
destroy all that he has left.

15:50.006 --> 15:51.771
We both want the same thing.

15:51.773 --> 15:54.207
But Jerusalem is guarded
by magical gates

15:54.209 --> 15:56.309
that not even
you can break through.

15:56.311 --> 15:58.047
Believe me, I can.

16:11.324 --> 16:12.959
Oh, dear God. Oh!

16:12.961 --> 16:13.996
Oh, my God!

16:18.033 --> 16:19.265
Get out of the way.

16:19.267 --> 16:21.568
Hear me, Jerusalem.

16:21.570 --> 16:24.237
Destruction awaits you.

16:27.343 --> 16:30.044
Hear me, Jerusalem.

16:30.046 --> 16:32.947
Destruction awaits you.

16:32.949 --> 16:34.481
Did you hear that?

16:34.483 --> 16:36.483
Yeah, at least ten times.

16:36.485 --> 16:38.318
Since dawn this morning.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.087
If it keeps on like this,
the city will collapse.

16:41.089 --> 16:43.991
Believe me, it's twice as hard
with ears like mine.

16:43.993 --> 16:48.428
I'll send all the lions, mules and
foxes of Jerusalem to silence him.

16:48.430 --> 16:50.563
Foxes? That's...

16:50.565 --> 16:52.165
That's a really bad idea.

16:52.167 --> 16:55.001
Like...

16:55.003 --> 16:59.973
Hear me, Jerusalem.
Destruction awaits you.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.976
This is Asmodeus.

17:01.978 --> 17:03.943
Demon of hatred.

17:03.945 --> 17:04.978
Did he escape?

17:04.980 --> 17:07.580
Asmodeus? A real demon?

17:07.583 --> 17:09.215
Did you hear that, Bilqis?

17:09.218 --> 17:10.483
Just as you wished.

17:10.486 --> 17:12.719
What? I wished for this?

17:12.721 --> 17:16.823
Tobby? What do we need for a
demo-destroying expedition?

17:16.825 --> 17:20.460
Well, if you're going on a trek, I'm
sure you'll find everything you need

17:20.462 --> 17:22.498
in Bilqis' luggage.

17:26.568 --> 17:29.505
Don't you two go nosing
through my things, okay?

17:34.009 --> 17:37.311
We might just borrow a couple
of this for our mission.

17:37.313 --> 17:39.112
But please, Your Highness.

17:39.114 --> 17:40.380
Don't go.

17:40.382 --> 17:42.315
Think of the dangers.

17:42.317 --> 17:44.150
The desert sun is very...

17:44.152 --> 17:45.686
I'll take goat grease.

17:45.688 --> 17:46.586
Factor 50.

17:46.588 --> 17:49.390
And who will rub it
onto your back?

17:49.392 --> 17:52.258
Oh. Well, uh...

17:52.260 --> 17:55.329
Eagle! Come to me, I command!

18:29.899 --> 18:32.733
That's very brave of you,
Your Highness.

18:32.735 --> 18:35.535
To confront
the screaming demon all alone.

18:35.537 --> 18:37.705
Brave, but foolish.

18:37.707 --> 18:42.442
Do not forget yourself, Eagle.
I am Solomon, the wise.

18:42.444 --> 18:46.045
Could you
hold it a bit steadier?

18:46.047 --> 18:49.582
Anymore turbulence
and I'll launch my breakfast.

18:49.584 --> 18:50.851
What are you doing here?

18:50.853 --> 18:53.722
Looking for adventure.
What else?

18:54.590 --> 18:56.524
Oh, now let's see where we are.

18:56.526 --> 18:59.560
Plenty of stone and sand,
far too much sun.

18:59.562 --> 19:01.428
So depressing.

19:01.430 --> 19:03.496
We are not on a holiday.

19:03.498 --> 19:07.066
We have arrived,
Your Highness.

19:07.068 --> 19:12.209
<i>Hear me, Jerusalem.
Destruction awaits you.</i>

19:16.444 --> 19:19.213
We don't wanna land here, do we?

19:19.215 --> 19:22.151
Solomon, the wise commanded it.

19:23.119 --> 19:24.855
And I obey.

19:25.821 --> 19:28.721
Hear me, Jerusalem.

19:28.723 --> 19:31.592
He should be locked up
for sound pollution.

19:31.594 --> 19:33.326
Let's get out of here.

19:33.328 --> 19:35.164
- Mm-mmm...
- No!

19:35.698 --> 19:37.430
You're coming with me.

19:37.432 --> 19:40.234
But you know I don't know
anything about demons.

19:40.236 --> 19:43.336
Leave Asmodeus to me.
You take care of Hadad.

19:43.338 --> 19:45.305
And make sure
he comes to no harm.

19:45.307 --> 19:46.473
No harm?

19:47.576 --> 19:48.909
This one's so bad,

19:48.911 --> 19:51.847
even the vultures would
turn their beaks up at him.

20:06.929 --> 20:10.197
Asmodeus, I command you
to release him.

20:10.199 --> 20:13.833
You will have
to defeat me first, child king.

20:13.835 --> 20:16.102
Then you can tell me what to do.

20:16.104 --> 20:20.774
I can see that your time in
chains has drained your strength.

20:20.776 --> 20:25.012
I still got plenty enough left
to deal with you.

20:25.014 --> 20:26.583
Whoa!

20:39.428 --> 20:40.997
You take care of Hadad.

20:46.802 --> 20:50.740
Everything's fine.
I caught him.

20:54.776 --> 20:57.113
Show yourself, demon.

20:58.113 --> 21:00.080
As you wish.

21:17.298 --> 21:20.269
Prepare to die, Solomon.

21:28.143 --> 21:29.409
What's that?

21:29.411 --> 21:30.313
Perfect.

21:47.830 --> 21:49.232
Serve me!

21:57.073 --> 21:59.473
I'm telling you
for the final time

21:59.475 --> 22:02.141
to bow before my will.

22:02.143 --> 22:04.578
And why would I do that?

22:04.580 --> 22:05.815
Now!

22:26.334 --> 22:28.267
I'm coming, Kinglet.

22:28.269 --> 22:30.803
I hope I've avoided
the dangerous bit.

22:30.805 --> 22:32.139
Is that Asmo...

22:32.141 --> 22:33.239
Asmodeus?

22:33.241 --> 22:36.610
Don't worry.
I've caught him in a magic trap.

22:36.612 --> 22:38.344
Great. Well, we can go then.

22:38.346 --> 22:41.849
After we make sure that these two
never see the light of day again.

22:41.851 --> 22:44.083
We're taking them both with us

22:44.085 --> 22:44.918
to Jerusalem.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.787
Have you gone stark raving mad?

22:47.789 --> 22:49.255
The demon as well?

22:49.257 --> 22:50.890
Especially the demon.

22:50.892 --> 22:52.191
I want Bilqis to see that

22:52.193 --> 22:55.027
I'm just as courageous
as my father was before me.

22:55.029 --> 22:57.898
Yeah, yeah,
you risk everyone's life,

22:57.900 --> 22:59.867
because of a dead man.

22:59.869 --> 23:02.472
Eagle! Eagle, come to me.

23:10.112 --> 23:11.081
Take us home.

23:12.547 --> 23:15.215
I'm sorry, but I can't.

23:15.217 --> 23:16.949
But I command you.

23:16.951 --> 23:18.851
I promised your father,

23:18.853 --> 23:22.523
I would protect you
from making stupid decisions.

23:22.525 --> 23:25.425
Are you saying that
you don't want to take us home?

23:25.427 --> 23:27.660
Let's say, I can't carry

23:27.662 --> 23:29.098
such a heavy load.

23:31.232 --> 23:34.634
Okay then, Kinglet,
just get rid of them now.

23:34.636 --> 23:35.968
Forget it.

23:35.970 --> 23:38.805
There's no way we're leaving
Hadad or the demon here.

23:38.807 --> 23:40.373
Well, it looks like we're stuck,

23:40.375 --> 23:43.312
because we'll never make it
through the desert on foot.

23:44.113 --> 23:46.246
Hee-yaw!

23:46.248 --> 23:47.249
Hee-yaw!

24:46.609 --> 24:49.212
Solomon, you're alive.

24:55.183 --> 24:56.518
What's that?

24:57.518 --> 24:59.285
Oh, I understand.

24:59.287 --> 25:00.821
This is him.

25:00.823 --> 25:02.992
Stand aside, Jehoshafat.

25:14.836 --> 25:19.041
This is your father's
demon defense system.

25:22.577 --> 25:24.311
Cancel the spell, Jehoshafat.

25:24.313 --> 25:27.214
But that will leave
the City unprotected.

25:27.216 --> 25:30.182
Your father'd never allow
such a thing.

25:30.184 --> 25:34.389
But I am King now
and I command you.

25:50.171 --> 25:50.903
Hey?

25:50.905 --> 25:52.140
Wait for me.

26:00.082 --> 26:02.949
Are you out
of your mind, Solomon?

26:02.951 --> 26:04.383
You deliberately brought

26:04.385 --> 26:07.688
Asmodeus into
the city of Jerusalem!

26:07.690 --> 26:09.957
You wouldn't understand,
old man.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.492
I need to shine
in front of Bilqis.

26:12.494 --> 26:14.261
Oh, you poor child.

26:14.263 --> 26:17.930
Bilqis' beauty
blinded you completely.

26:17.932 --> 26:20.967
I've proved that I'm as great
as my father was.

26:20.969 --> 26:22.569
How silly you are.

26:22.571 --> 26:26.773
Your vanity is going
to destroy Jerusalem.

26:33.481 --> 26:35.417
Free at last.

26:43.124 --> 26:47.794
I command that you return
to the jar at once.

26:47.796 --> 26:49.062
No, thanks.

26:49.064 --> 26:51.497
It was a bit tight
on the shoulders.

26:51.499 --> 26:54.569
And I wasn't mad
about the decor either.

26:58.239 --> 27:00.172
Oh.

27:02.143 --> 27:04.777
Is this the famous ring?

27:04.779 --> 27:05.711
Hmm.

27:05.713 --> 27:07.613
Quite a pretty little thing.

27:07.615 --> 27:11.517
I was just thinking that
I should really kill Solomon.

27:12.488 --> 27:15.391
Then you can give it
to me as you promised.

27:18.227 --> 27:19.126
Kill him.

27:19.128 --> 27:21.631
You serve me
from now on.

27:22.296 --> 27:23.298
Kill him.

27:36.111 --> 27:37.580
We're coming, sire.

27:43.184 --> 27:46.053
The demon's breath
fills everybody with hate.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.658
You've lost that
happy twinkle in your eyes.

27:54.896 --> 27:56.365
A veil, boys?

27:56.965 --> 27:58.334
Much prettier.

28:18.687 --> 28:20.089
Hey. Who's here?

28:27.996 --> 28:29.364
Don't let him get away.

28:40.942 --> 28:44.578
Now that's what I call
a slippery ending.

28:44.580 --> 28:48.180
Sorry, but you big,
ugly whoever you are.

28:48.182 --> 28:49.551
Did you happen to...

28:49.817 --> 28:51.383
What?

28:51.385 --> 28:53.488
Have I been kidnapped or what?

28:54.021 --> 28:55.354
Hmm?

28:55.356 --> 28:56.224
Oh!

29:07.603 --> 29:09.902
Jerusalem is mine.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.453
Eagle, come to me.

29:25.053 --> 29:26.453
At last.

29:26.455 --> 29:29.592
I hate gravity and there's
a bit too much of it up here.

29:35.396 --> 29:37.429
Let me ride on your back, Eagle.

29:37.431 --> 29:40.870
You're unworthy
of your father's inheritance.

29:41.603 --> 29:43.035
He's right.

29:43.037 --> 29:46.273
Goodness is buried
so deep in your heart,

29:46.275 --> 29:48.307
that only the Shamir,

29:48.309 --> 29:51.379
the stone digger,
could bring it out.

29:52.046 --> 29:53.313
The Shamir?

29:53.315 --> 29:55.383
Eagle... No!

30:00.822 --> 30:02.988
Solomon is dead.

30:02.990 --> 30:05.257
I blew him high up in the air,

30:05.259 --> 30:06.592
like a feather.

30:06.594 --> 30:10.130
And he'll come back down
to the ground like a brick.

30:10.132 --> 30:12.267
Woo! Plop.

30:14.536 --> 30:17.871
The throne
of Jerusalem is mine.

30:17.873 --> 30:19.605
Hey, what's this?

30:19.607 --> 30:21.309
Let go!

30:32.187 --> 30:34.153
You'll pay for this insolence.

30:34.155 --> 30:37.626
I swear, I'll have you
cut up into spittoons.

30:41.930 --> 30:43.662
It looks like they think

30:43.664 --> 30:47.700
someone is going to return and send
you back to your dungeon in the deep.

30:47.702 --> 30:51.137
Only David was capable
of such an act.

30:51.139 --> 30:52.471
And he is dead.

30:52.473 --> 30:54.740
Along with his stupid son.

30:54.742 --> 30:56.376
Maybe he is still alive

30:56.378 --> 30:59.044
and would imprison you
with the help of the Shamir.

30:59.046 --> 31:00.679
The Shamir?

31:00.681 --> 31:02.181
The stone worm.

31:02.183 --> 31:05.384
It's as ancient and old
as the world itself

31:05.386 --> 31:07.853
and can tunnel
through the toughest rock.

31:07.855 --> 31:09.989
Where can I find this creature?

31:09.991 --> 31:11.524
David and Jehoshafat

31:11.526 --> 31:15.227
kept its hiding place,
a closely-guarded secret.

31:15.229 --> 31:18.233
So it must be somewhere
around here.

31:25.239 --> 31:27.907
Give me the ring, you promised.

31:27.909 --> 31:28.874
You fool.

31:31.279 --> 31:33.746
I haven't got time to waste.

31:33.748 --> 31:35.215
From now on,

31:35.217 --> 31:37.453
I will be your Master.

31:46.628 --> 31:47.930
No, no, no.

32:26.535 --> 32:28.200
Why has my curse

32:28.202 --> 32:29.604
had no effect on you?

32:30.271 --> 32:31.938
I'm too old.

32:31.940 --> 32:33.672
And I know you too well

32:33.674 --> 32:37.276
for your evil magic
to have any power over me.

32:37.278 --> 32:39.978
Show me where
you've hidden the Shamir.

32:54.429 --> 32:57.565
Oh, yes. I see now.

33:02.269 --> 33:03.836
This is the rhyme

33:03.838 --> 33:06.941
that reveals
the whereabouts of the Shamir.

33:15.049 --> 33:17.452
Tobby. Tobby, where are you?

33:25.360 --> 33:28.261
It's okay, pal.

33:28.263 --> 33:30.630
We are gonna be just fine.

33:30.632 --> 33:31.665
Just fine?

33:31.667 --> 33:34.734
First, "Ooh!" going up
and, "Aah!" going down.

33:34.736 --> 33:37.340
And you say that
things are just fine?

33:37.873 --> 33:38.971
Relax.

33:38.973 --> 33:40.273
It could be much worse.

33:40.275 --> 33:43.075
What could be worse
than a mouthful of sand?

33:44.478 --> 33:46.478
And ears stuffed full of gravel.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.547
The fact that
a demon has taken control

33:48.549 --> 33:50.015
of all of Jerusalem?

33:50.017 --> 33:51.821
And who's fault would that be?

33:52.386 --> 33:54.720
I suppose it's mine.

33:54.722 --> 33:56.989
But Bilqis is
just so beautiful and...

33:56.991 --> 34:02.195
Look, Kinglet. I was always on your side
when it was about fun, or a freaky thing.

34:02.197 --> 34:04.464
But now you screwed it up.

34:04.466 --> 34:06.265
What were you thinking?

34:06.267 --> 34:08.667
I don't... I don't know.

34:08.668 --> 34:11.404
My father, David,
was such a great King.

34:11.406 --> 34:12.672
I don't know anything

34:12.674 --> 34:14.973
about what he knew
because I'm just...

34:14.975 --> 34:16.411
just a silly kid.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.813
Hey, don't.

34:20.815 --> 34:23.851
What would the girls think
if they saw the King crying?

34:27.455 --> 34:29.524
Fine. I'm fine.

34:32.293 --> 34:33.460
What's that?

34:33.462 --> 34:36.462
Ah, it's an old poem
my dad taught me.

34:36.464 --> 34:38.598
It gives
the whereabouts of the Shamir.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.299
The legendary stone worm

34:40.301 --> 34:42.902
who could chew mountains
into mole hills.

34:42.904 --> 34:44.270
What? That Shamir?

34:44.272 --> 34:46.239
Do you remember
what the Eagle said?

34:46.241 --> 34:47.373
Sure I do.

34:47.375 --> 34:48.908
He said that I'm a useless King

34:48.909 --> 34:51.344
who deserves to make
a hole in the desert.

34:51.346 --> 34:54.346
And that only the Shamir
can help you?

34:54.348 --> 34:56.516
Of course. You're right!

34:56.518 --> 34:59.451
The Shamir can send
the demons back to prison.

34:59.453 --> 35:01.054
Beyond the deserts,

35:01.056 --> 35:02.554
mother of all gods,

35:02.556 --> 35:05.491
at the feet of
the sun kissed rocks...

35:05.493 --> 35:07.726
Across the red cliff canyons,

35:07.728 --> 35:10.263
is a town carved into stone

35:10.265 --> 35:11.563
where Shamir is left

35:11.565 --> 35:13.035
in peace alone.

35:13.401 --> 35:14.500
Hmm.

35:14.502 --> 35:17.437
Tell me where those canyons are.

35:17.439 --> 35:19.906
It's a town
carved into stone.

35:19.908 --> 35:21.341
Hey, I know that.

35:21.343 --> 35:24.576
I've traveled along the winding
path at the bottom of a red canyon.

35:24.578 --> 35:26.411
Beyond the copper mine.

35:26.413 --> 35:28.348
In the bare hills,

35:28.350 --> 35:30.116
a city carved in stone.

35:30.118 --> 35:32.252
- That can...
- ...only be...

35:32.254 --> 35:33.489
Petra.

35:41.596 --> 35:44.830
So, what are we going to do now?

35:44.832 --> 35:46.399
Stop.

35:46.401 --> 35:47.866
We have to get to Petra.

35:47.868 --> 35:50.004
And you will show me the way.

35:55.743 --> 35:57.076
Do you think it's deaf?

35:57.078 --> 35:58.980
I said, "Stop."

36:00.015 --> 36:01.513
Now that's more like it.

36:01.515 --> 36:04.018
An army of servants
is better than one.

36:06.555 --> 36:09.991
Are you sure they're here
to serve you, Kinglet?

36:17.598 --> 36:19.565
Now we're really in trouble.

36:19.567 --> 36:21.500
Which way to Petra?

36:21.502 --> 36:23.004
I don't know.

36:23.471 --> 36:25.038
Okay.

36:25.040 --> 36:29.241
Which way to anywhere with a bit
of shade and a drop of water?

36:29.243 --> 36:30.912
Maybe that way.

36:53.801 --> 36:56.603
Tobby, don't stop now.

36:56.605 --> 36:58.873
Water? I'm parched.

37:03.444 --> 37:05.545
Stop, do you hear?

37:05.547 --> 37:07.245
As King of Jerusalem,

37:07.247 --> 37:08.448
I command you to...

37:11.319 --> 37:12.484
...stop.

37:12.486 --> 37:13.755
Stop, I say.

37:42.484 --> 37:44.683
Please let me help you,
my friend.

37:44.685 --> 37:46.220
Show me
where you're going.

38:21.656 --> 38:25.158
I think there is something
very wrong here, Nanny.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.859
This place is gross.
Where are we?

38:27.861 --> 38:29.696
Be quiet now, My Queen.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.931
Be quiet when
I feel like screaming?

38:31.933 --> 38:33.699
What happened in the palace?

38:33.701 --> 38:35.268
And where are we?

38:35.270 --> 38:37.270
We are in the secret tunnels.

38:37.272 --> 38:38.705
They run under the palace

38:38.707 --> 38:41.406
so that the King can escape
in case of danger.

38:41.408 --> 38:43.308
Oh, I chipped a nail.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.210
My make up is all smudged and...

38:45.212 --> 38:46.712
and I am a Queen!

38:46.714 --> 38:48.850
And I wanna go home right now!

38:55.589 --> 38:57.390
Puppet of hatred,

38:57.392 --> 38:59.158
I now order you,

38:59.160 --> 39:00.395
go to Petra.

39:01.261 --> 39:03.529
As you wish, Master.

39:03.531 --> 39:05.565
You will be a wealthy suitor

39:05.567 --> 39:07.734
to the daughter of King Salim,

39:07.736 --> 39:08.937
the King of Petra.

39:09.337 --> 39:10.435
Go there,

39:10.437 --> 39:12.071
and seize the Shamir,

39:12.073 --> 39:13.808
the stone worm.

39:21.181 --> 39:22.547
Petra?

39:26.855 --> 39:30.656
King Salim will surely give you
a big bag of money.

39:30.658 --> 39:33.792
Just in case you wanna
buy me a lovely present.

39:33.794 --> 39:36.094
I have no intention
of telling anyone

39:36.096 --> 39:36.964
that we're here.

39:37.232 --> 39:38.196
What?

39:38.198 --> 39:40.533
Then let's be a cool fox

39:40.535 --> 39:42.100
and his clown on the road.

39:42.102 --> 39:44.337
I'm going to pretend
to be a simple beggar

39:44.339 --> 39:47.440
in order to avoid
drawing attention to myself.

39:47.442 --> 39:48.975
Halt.

39:48.977 --> 39:51.210
What do you want in Petra?

39:51.212 --> 39:52.612
I am poor

39:52.614 --> 39:54.013
and thirsty.

39:54.015 --> 39:55.580
Huh?

39:55.582 --> 39:57.415
If you're willing to work hard,

39:57.417 --> 39:59.153
I already have the job for you.

40:04.692 --> 40:07.161
Na'ama!

40:07.861 --> 40:09.594
Father, leave me alone.

40:09.596 --> 40:12.265
I have the right to know
where you have been.

40:12.267 --> 40:13.498
All right.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.268
I went to the Bedouin's camp

40:15.270 --> 40:16.335
beyond the thorn bush.

40:16.337 --> 40:19.437
An unmarried princess
should stay in the palace.

40:19.439 --> 40:23.141
I have still not met a man
whose hand I would even shake.

40:23.143 --> 40:26.245
You have to be married
by your next birthday.

40:26.247 --> 40:28.915
If no better suitor
presents himself,

40:28.917 --> 40:30.650
I swear I'll marry you off

40:30.652 --> 40:32.551
to the royal camel poop-scooper.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.123
Wow!

40:38.125 --> 40:40.495
That was King Salim's daughter?

40:42.830 --> 40:44.533
Pretty pretty, huh?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.301
Arub, witch of the kitchen.

40:48.303 --> 40:50.703
This man seeks work.

40:50.705 --> 40:52.004
All I can see

40:52.006 --> 40:53.873
is a bony little cockerel,

40:53.875 --> 40:55.641
followed by a rat.

40:56.710 --> 40:59.645
Work him hard
and make a man of him.

40:59.647 --> 41:01.112
Back to the wash tub.

41:01.114 --> 41:03.986
You can use your rat
as a dish cloth, if you like.

41:04.953 --> 41:06.286
Is she serious?

41:09.357 --> 41:10.489
And I've always wanted
to sit in a gold chamber pot.

41:10.491 --> 41:11.656
But, no.

41:11.658 --> 41:14.061
You prefer to do the washing up.

41:24.205 --> 41:27.009
You don't have time
to look at the ladies.

41:28.343 --> 41:30.245
Say it's not, it's him.

41:31.946 --> 41:34.817
Run, the arrogant kid is here.

41:43.424 --> 41:44.457
Get some sleep.

41:44.459 --> 41:47.596
Tomorrow is going to be
a hardworking day.

41:57.739 --> 42:00.475
It's him. I told you it was him.

42:01.442 --> 42:02.475
You're right.

42:02.477 --> 42:03.808
I recognize him.

42:03.810 --> 42:05.544
Animal abuser.

42:05.546 --> 42:07.279
Ant-eater.

42:07.281 --> 42:08.748
Donkey sadist.

42:08.750 --> 42:11.250
Everybody in Petra
knows who you are.

42:11.252 --> 42:14.654
So you would be advised
to keep it a low profile.

42:14.656 --> 42:16.123
Leave them, Tobby.

42:19.993 --> 42:21.960
- Tobby?
- Huh?

42:21.962 --> 42:24.596
Is that really how you see me?

42:24.598 --> 42:26.966
Well, besides me, Kinglet,

42:26.968 --> 42:28.801
I don't know another animal

42:28.803 --> 42:31.339
who cares a flea's itch for you.

42:48.189 --> 42:51.326
Go back to work,
you lazy servant.

43:33.033 --> 43:35.701
I will sell you
to the King's kitchen,

43:35.703 --> 43:37.005
you beast.

43:48.882 --> 43:50.216
I'll show you.

43:50.218 --> 43:52.053
You smelly hunchback.

43:55.223 --> 43:58.089
Stop.
What are you doing?

43:58.091 --> 44:00.960
How dare you hurt
that poor creature?

44:00.962 --> 44:02.497
Stop that at once.

44:15.276 --> 44:16.308
Wait.

44:16.310 --> 44:17.275
Who are you?

44:17.277 --> 44:21.216
I... I work
in the kitchen, Princess.

44:23.350 --> 44:25.518
I've seen your face before.

44:25.520 --> 44:26.518
What's your name?

44:26.520 --> 44:29.256
I'm sorry, but I've got
to finish my chores.

44:31.558 --> 44:33.025
I know what you did,

44:33.027 --> 44:34.692
just now in the square.

44:34.694 --> 44:36.194
I saw it all.

44:36.196 --> 44:38.830
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:38.832 --> 44:40.799
You saved the camel.

44:40.801 --> 44:42.734
You must be mistaken.

44:42.736 --> 44:44.335
I've never met a servant before

44:44.337 --> 44:47.672
who gives as much
as a whisker about animals.

44:47.674 --> 44:48.841
Go back to work,

44:48.843 --> 44:50.511
you lazy servant.

44:53.013 --> 44:54.413
Go, Tobby.

44:54.415 --> 44:57.716
We must hurry to find where
King Salim is hiding the Shamir.

44:57.718 --> 44:58.620
Hmm.

45:25.546 --> 45:26.545
You will be amazed

45:26.547 --> 45:29.415
at the gifts
your many suitors have sent you.

45:29.417 --> 45:31.650
I don't even want to see them.

45:33.921 --> 45:37.158
A precious rug
from Prince Wasim,

45:38.259 --> 45:40.058
with a woven camel.

45:40.060 --> 45:42.895
And this is from Prince Sahi,

45:42.897 --> 45:44.196
a clay jar.

45:44.198 --> 45:46.565
A skilled artist drew on it

45:46.567 --> 45:47.803
a camel.

45:49.136 --> 45:52.036
And guess what
Prince Asom has sent you?

45:52.038 --> 45:53.707
Maybe a camel?

45:54.174 --> 45:55.643
How did you know?

46:16.196 --> 46:17.696
Did you find anything?

46:17.698 --> 46:20.966
I've not left a single stone
in Petra unturned.

46:20.968 --> 46:22.967
But the stone worm has simply...

46:22.969 --> 46:24.703
disappeared.

46:24.705 --> 46:26.272
Salim keeps his whereabouts

46:26.274 --> 46:27.540
such close secret

46:27.542 --> 46:30.375
that not even the wee animals
know where it is.

46:30.377 --> 46:33.212
It could be somewhere else
entirely by now.

46:33.214 --> 46:36.281
Perhaps, if you ask the girl...

46:36.283 --> 46:38.183
You mean, Princess Na'ama?

46:38.185 --> 46:40.386
I'm a servant.
How can I do that?

46:40.388 --> 46:42.955
She'd sniff
something suspicious right away.

46:42.957 --> 46:44.890
That's what happens
when you decide

46:44.892 --> 46:46.926
to enslave yourself, you...

46:46.928 --> 46:48.330
you silly kid.

46:49.330 --> 46:52.765
But, I'm still
the King of Jerusalem.

46:59.940 --> 47:00.908
Princess.

47:01.875 --> 47:03.442
Who were you talking to?

47:03.444 --> 47:07.078
Me? Oh. I was
just playing a game.

47:07.080 --> 47:10.449
Talking to yourself sounds like
a pretty silly game to me.

47:10.451 --> 47:13.819
No sillier than listening in
on a kitchen boy.

47:13.821 --> 47:16.020
Okay. Enough with the games.

47:16.022 --> 47:17.957
I know exactly who you are.

47:17.959 --> 47:19.426
Na'ama?

47:22.964 --> 47:25.029
What do you
want me to see, Kinglet?

47:25.031 --> 47:26.834
You've made a royal mess.

47:29.370 --> 47:32.507
Na'ama?
Where are you, my dear?

47:36.143 --> 47:37.812
Come on out, Princess.

47:42.984 --> 47:44.583
What's wrong, Father?

47:44.585 --> 47:46.851
Has snow fallen
in the desert or something?

47:46.853 --> 47:50.922
No. It's an even more
amazing miracle than that.

47:50.924 --> 47:54.460
My girl, a messenger
has just brought this letter,

47:54.462 --> 47:55.363
look.

47:56.196 --> 47:58.230
What are you talking
about, Father?

47:58.232 --> 47:59.931
Read it to Na'ama.

47:59.933 --> 48:01.734
My throat is aching.

48:01.736 --> 48:05.804
I, Khalif Abdul Hameed
Eben Abud Al Khader,

48:05.806 --> 48:09.540
have heard of the great beauty
of Na'ama of Petra,

48:09.542 --> 48:12.810
and will arrive in the city
on the girl's birthday,

48:12.812 --> 48:14.548
to take her as my wife.

48:16.951 --> 48:19.083
- No.
- Yes.

48:19.085 --> 48:22.054
The Khalif wants to marry you.

48:22.056 --> 48:24.593
No. No, no, no!

48:28.696 --> 48:31.397
Hurry back to your master
and inform him that

48:31.399 --> 48:34.333
my daughter awaits his arrival
with a joyful heart.

49:04.998 --> 49:06.431
What an honor.

49:06.433 --> 49:09.634
Princess Na'ama will ride
on my back with her husband

49:09.636 --> 49:11.772
after the wedding ceremony.

49:12.306 --> 49:14.038
How do I look?

49:14.040 --> 49:16.040
Like a drunken Nubian sailor

49:16.042 --> 49:17.909
who's dressed up
as a belly dancer.

49:17.911 --> 49:21.346
That sounds good,
coming from a dish cloth.

49:21.348 --> 49:22.880
Stop that, you lot.

49:22.882 --> 49:24.783
Get the camel out there.

49:24.785 --> 49:25.717
The groom has arrived.

49:25.719 --> 49:30.489
Today is
Princess Na'ama's birthday.

49:30.491 --> 49:33.458
She is to be married
on this special day,

49:33.460 --> 49:37.328
to Khalif Abdul Hameed
Eben Abd Al Khader,

49:37.330 --> 49:40.933
who fell in love with her
before they even met.

49:59.352 --> 50:01.487
I am Khalif Khader.

50:01.489 --> 50:03.755
And I have broken
my hurried journey

50:03.757 --> 50:06.859
to ask for the hand
of your beautiful daughter.

50:06.861 --> 50:11.330
Of course, but no need
to rush things quite that much.

50:11.332 --> 50:14.065
I don't have time
for a long ceremony

50:14.067 --> 50:15.967
so if you've changed
your mind...

50:15.969 --> 50:17.603
Of course, not.

50:17.605 --> 50:20.438
It's just that
my daughter is here

50:20.440 --> 50:24.609
and she has her hand with us so we
can get right on with the wedd...

50:24.611 --> 50:28.714
Excellent. But first let us
respect the traditions.

50:28.716 --> 50:31.850
The father of the bride
has to fulfill a request,

50:31.852 --> 50:33.518
made by the groom.

50:33.520 --> 50:37.321
Don't worry. I only want
something very small.

50:37.323 --> 50:40.158
Give me the Shamir.

50:42.629 --> 50:46.598
Uh... The stone? The stone worm?

50:46.600 --> 50:48.900
What are you
talking about, Father?

50:48.902 --> 50:51.870
Would you go against
such an ancient tradition?

50:54.073 --> 50:55.940
No. Of course, not.

50:55.942 --> 50:58.377
If you want me
to marry your daughter,

50:58.379 --> 51:00.848
you have to decide right now.

51:21.100 --> 51:23.669
Shamir, the stone worm that...

51:23.671 --> 51:27.038
Stop. If the Khalif
insists on traditions,

51:27.040 --> 51:28.574
then we should respect them all.

51:28.576 --> 51:30.708
Not another tradition.

51:30.710 --> 51:33.111
The tradition
of our people states

51:33.113 --> 51:36.515
that if the Princess of Petra
has two suitors...

51:36.517 --> 51:38.382
Two! Who is the other?

51:38.384 --> 51:40.685
...then they have
to fight a dual

51:40.687 --> 51:42.821
and with a weapon of her choice.

51:42.823 --> 51:44.823
Oh, please, forgive me, Khalif.

51:44.825 --> 51:48.292
But this is the first time
I've heard of a second suitor.

51:48.294 --> 51:50.962
- Where is he?
- The second suitor?

51:50.964 --> 51:52.397
Um, uh...

51:52.399 --> 51:54.333
Here I am, Your Highness.

51:54.335 --> 51:58.971
I would like to ask for Princess
Na'ama's hand in marriage.

51:58.973 --> 52:00.638
Are you serious, Kinglet?

52:00.640 --> 52:02.007
And what about Bilqis?

52:02.009 --> 52:04.810
I have to get my hands
on the stone worm.

52:04.812 --> 52:08.246
The kitchen boy.
That's, that's...

52:08.248 --> 52:11.084
Yes. That's him.
Let him through.

52:12.486 --> 52:15.120
No. Solomon is alive?

52:15.122 --> 52:16.554
That's impossible.

52:16.556 --> 52:18.959
How did he survive
a fall like that?

52:19.493 --> 52:22.226
Hadad? Listen to me.

52:22.228 --> 52:25.065
Kill him. Kill him now.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.667
Wait. Not like this.

52:28.669 --> 52:32.207
This is out of the question.
Soldiers, seize the kitchen boy.

52:33.239 --> 52:35.140
But you can't do that, Father.

52:35.142 --> 52:36.507
What about the traditions?

52:36.509 --> 52:40.645
No tradition can convince me to
marry my daughter to a servant.

52:40.647 --> 52:43.114
But he's... he's not a servant.

52:43.116 --> 52:46.350
Take your hands off Solomon,
King of Jerusalem,

52:46.352 --> 52:48.722
who has asked
for my hand in marriage.

52:49.089 --> 52:50.022
You knew?

52:50.024 --> 52:52.891
I listened in. I'm sorry.
It's a bad habit.

52:52.893 --> 52:56.627
You! You are
the son of David, Solomon.

52:56.629 --> 53:00.065
I taught him all he knows
about washing up.

53:00.067 --> 53:04.770
Forgive me, King Salim, for disguising
myself and hiding in your city.

53:04.772 --> 53:07.438
Please give me your
daughter's hand in marriage.

53:07.440 --> 53:10.308
I thought you've been cast
from the throne.

53:10.310 --> 53:11.877
That's right, but...

53:11.879 --> 53:14.478
I'm sorry,
but with your kingdom gone...

53:14.480 --> 53:16.848
Tell him that
you'll have a dual with him.

53:16.850 --> 53:20.085
This way no one
can accuse you of murder.

53:20.087 --> 53:23.888
King Salim, I accept
the challenge of a dual.

53:23.890 --> 53:27.158
What? Well,
I'm really not so sure.

53:27.160 --> 53:30.828
The weapon of my choice
is the power of the mind.

53:30.830 --> 53:33.531
He who answers
three riddles correctly

53:33.533 --> 53:35.266
will be the winner of my hand.

53:35.268 --> 53:36.971
Father? You can be the judge.

53:37.404 --> 53:38.540
Hmm.

53:49.549 --> 53:51.716
What? A battle of minds?

53:51.718 --> 53:53.384
That won't kill him.

53:53.386 --> 53:55.187
You have to win, Hadad.

53:55.189 --> 53:57.888
Do you hear?
I will give you the answers.

53:57.890 --> 54:00.158
Here is the first question.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.993
It is still while it lives

54:01.995 --> 54:06.063
but when it's beheaded,
it sets sail on the sea.

54:06.065 --> 54:10.067
Oh, wise Khalif, you have
the chance to answer first.

54:10.069 --> 54:13.004
Still? Beheaded? Sea?

54:13.006 --> 54:16.040
I don't know.
Say something, you starecrow.

54:16.042 --> 54:17.109
Khalif.

54:17.111 --> 54:19.544
Uh, an old scarecrow?

54:19.546 --> 54:21.379
Thrown into the ocean?

54:21.381 --> 54:23.882
Scarecrow? Now you, Solomon.

54:23.884 --> 54:26.652
The correct answer is a tree

54:26.654 --> 54:28.754
that is cut down to make a boat.

54:30.357 --> 54:33.594
Well, the right answer...

54:34.160 --> 54:35.761
It's very simple.

54:35.763 --> 54:38.196
The right answer is, scarecrow.

54:38.198 --> 54:40.464
But Father, that's not true.

54:40.466 --> 54:41.632
I am the judge,

54:41.634 --> 54:42.868
so, I decide.

54:42.870 --> 54:43.935
Let's have the next question.

54:43.937 --> 54:45.937
Now, for a more difficult one.

54:45.939 --> 54:49.107
You can only see it
with your eyes closed.

54:49.109 --> 54:51.042
Eyes closed?

54:51.044 --> 54:53.747
I can't imagine
what it could be.

54:54.580 --> 54:58.850
The answer is, imagination.

54:58.852 --> 55:02.319
The thing we can only see with
our eyes closed is a dream.

55:04.190 --> 55:07.591
Correct. The correct answer
is imagination.

55:08.995 --> 55:12.630
But Father, we can imagine
things with our eyes open, too.

55:12.632 --> 55:14.299
You're cheating.

55:14.301 --> 55:18.203
Khalif has answered correctly once
again, and so you will marry him.

55:18.205 --> 55:20.705
But they still have
one more question.

55:20.707 --> 55:23.107
Giant birds with wings of gray

55:23.109 --> 55:25.544
clouds the skies
all night and day.

55:25.546 --> 55:26.478
What is it?

55:26.480 --> 55:29.281
Is it... Is it a faded raven?

55:29.283 --> 55:30.716
Yes, of course, it is.

55:30.718 --> 55:32.216
I'm sorry, Your Highness,

55:32.218 --> 55:34.819
but the correct answer to your
daughter's question is fog.

55:34.821 --> 55:37.589
Enough! Enough of
these childish games.

55:37.591 --> 55:41.292
King Salim, if you don't give
me your daughter's hand,

55:41.294 --> 55:42.694
- I...
- But I will.

55:42.696 --> 55:45.366
Guards, seize him!

55:54.741 --> 55:56.777
Step on it, Kinglet.

56:05.419 --> 56:07.351
Kidnapper. Catch him!

56:07.353 --> 56:08.453
Na'ama!

56:08.455 --> 56:11.522
This getting married thing
really isn't my style.

56:11.524 --> 56:14.326
Just my luck.
I get all dressed up

56:14.328 --> 56:16.297
and they ruined that as well.

56:22.736 --> 56:25.469
Relax, Nubian,
I've got your rear covered.

56:25.471 --> 56:29.007
Have you followed me all
this way, you cursed demon?

56:29.009 --> 56:30.078
Watch out.

56:43.390 --> 56:44.759
Hang on a minute.

56:53.901 --> 56:55.299
Yeah.

57:23.363 --> 57:26.464
Right! To my right,
you desert horse.

57:26.466 --> 57:28.333
Left, left!

57:37.578 --> 57:39.176
Where has the box gone?

57:39.178 --> 57:39.911
It's gone?

57:39.913 --> 57:42.714
Oh, my lovely, round bottom.

57:42.716 --> 57:46.817
Don't worry, that's not lost.
I can see it quite clearly.

57:46.819 --> 57:49.422
If we've lost it,
we're done for.

57:52.792 --> 57:54.893
What do you know, old beggar?

57:54.895 --> 57:56.460
Don't speak to him like that.

57:56.462 --> 58:00.866
He might be poor, but he
still deserves some respect.

58:00.868 --> 58:03.667
Sorry old man.
I meant nothing by it.

58:03.669 --> 58:05.737
What are you doing
in the desert?

58:05.739 --> 58:07.973
Searching for a scorpion

58:07.975 --> 58:11.045
to drop in your big ear
while you sleep.

58:11.745 --> 58:13.745
Kinglet, did you hear?

58:13.747 --> 58:15.714
The old man understood me.

58:15.716 --> 58:18.783
Not now, Tobby. It's all over.

58:18.785 --> 58:20.752
The stone worm has escaped.

58:20.754 --> 58:22.620
The soldiers!

58:24.857 --> 58:26.060
My father?

58:26.727 --> 58:28.859
Oh... Sorry.

58:28.861 --> 58:31.295
Come back, you punk on legs.

58:31.297 --> 58:33.765
Looks like we're in
for a wild fight.

58:33.767 --> 58:35.870
And you want
to leave me out of it?

58:41.908 --> 58:45.576
Ooh, look. If it isn't
the desert deserter.

58:46.980 --> 58:49.080
Don't worry,
this is my old friend,

58:49.082 --> 58:50.915
the King of the skies.

58:50.917 --> 58:54.286
Well, if you folks
are done here,

58:54.288 --> 58:55.319
we can go.

58:57.123 --> 58:59.993
Come on, old man, you'll get
trampled if you stay here.

59:01.828 --> 59:04.395
Are you sure
you wanna save our lives?

59:04.397 --> 59:06.901
You can stay if you want.

59:17.377 --> 59:19.310
To me, soldiers.

59:19.312 --> 59:22.614
Solomon is alive
and on his way to Jerusalem.

59:22.616 --> 59:25.319
Set a trap and kill him.

59:39.131 --> 59:40.931
Please stay with me, old friend.

59:40.933 --> 59:42.132
I'm gonna need your help.

59:42.134 --> 59:45.770
This is a battle
that you have to fight, Solomon.

59:45.772 --> 59:50.011
If you really need me, I will
come without being called.

59:55.848 --> 59:58.750
- What's wrong?
- I failed as a king,

59:58.752 --> 01:00:01.622
and now I've let
the stone worm get away.

01:00:02.989 --> 01:00:04.922
What do you need
the stone worm for?

01:00:04.924 --> 01:00:07.891
Because I can only defeat
a demon with its power.

01:00:07.893 --> 01:00:09.995
- We should get going.
- Hang on a minute.

01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:12.299
Where's the nice, old man gone?

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.301
Old man? Nice old man.

01:00:16.303 --> 01:00:17.301
Where are you?

01:00:17.303 --> 01:00:19.339
Come on now, he'll follow us.

01:00:20.806 --> 01:00:22.906
I'll be a hat if that old tramp

01:00:22.908 --> 01:00:24.477
is on the straight and narrow.

01:00:37.857 --> 01:00:40.227
Leave that to me, Your Highness.

01:00:42.863 --> 01:00:46.998
Don't you have servants to
make fires for you in Petra?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.799
I'd feel ashamed of myself

01:00:48.801 --> 01:00:50.935
if I couldn't even do this much

01:00:50.937 --> 01:00:53.074
just because
I was born a princess.

01:00:55.674 --> 01:00:57.775
If my father could see me now,

01:00:57.777 --> 01:01:00.011
I'm sure he'd be ashamed of me.

01:01:00.013 --> 01:01:02.679
While you still have
your head and your heart,

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:04.384
you can't go very wrong.

01:01:07.953 --> 01:01:10.922
You make me jump,
you old bag of bones.

01:01:10.924 --> 01:01:12.556
Where have you been?

01:01:12.558 --> 01:01:13.761
Solomon?

01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:16.094
Yes?

01:01:16.096 --> 01:01:20.001
Tell me, is Queen Bilqis
as beautiful as people say?

01:01:20.433 --> 01:01:22.000
She really is.

01:01:22.002 --> 01:01:24.069
- But...
- Yes?

01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:26.071
Well, I don't know
how to say this,

01:01:26.073 --> 01:01:28.705
but your beauty
is just so different.

01:01:28.707 --> 01:01:31.576
Look! I knew it would be here.

01:01:31.578 --> 01:01:33.277
I recognize the plant.

01:01:33.279 --> 01:01:35.145
Tell me, you old jackal,

01:01:35.147 --> 01:01:37.281
how is it that
you understand me?

01:01:37.283 --> 01:01:39.716
As far as I knew,
Solomon was the only person

01:01:39.718 --> 01:01:41.518
on Earth who could do that.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.723
That's right.
He is the only... person.

01:01:48.428 --> 01:01:51.799
- What is it?
- It's a taproot. Give me your sword.

01:01:57.703 --> 01:01:58.571
Mmm.

01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:03.841
It's cool, and sweet.

01:02:03.843 --> 01:02:05.176
It's a miracle.

01:02:05.178 --> 01:02:08.179
It's no miracle.
Just knowledge and patience.

01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:09.617
That's all there is to it.

01:02:20.093 --> 01:02:21.462
We've arrived.

01:02:22.728 --> 01:02:23.797
Where to?

01:02:25.332 --> 01:02:27.866
I don't think
this is Jerusalem.

01:02:27.868 --> 01:02:29.634
I'm going this way, but,

01:02:29.636 --> 01:02:32.370
you must continue
down the other road.

01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:34.272
Why would I want to go that way?

01:02:34.274 --> 01:02:35.640
To tag on to a caravan

01:02:35.642 --> 01:02:37.678
that'll take you
all the way back home.

01:02:38.444 --> 01:02:39.277
Sorry?

01:02:39.279 --> 01:02:41.980
Jerusalem is a dangerous place.

01:02:41.982 --> 01:02:44.114
- So?
- Look, Na'ama,

01:02:44.116 --> 01:02:45.583
you have to understand that...

01:02:45.585 --> 01:02:49.323
I understand.
Well then, all the best.

01:03:08.341 --> 01:03:10.674
Do you really think
I'd leave you on your own?

01:03:10.676 --> 01:03:11.942
Na'ama.

01:03:11.944 --> 01:03:14.614
If so, then forget about it.

01:03:15.348 --> 01:03:16.681
I...

01:03:16.683 --> 01:03:19.350
You couldn't even wash up on
your own a couple of weeks ago.

01:03:19.352 --> 01:03:21.252
So don't pretend
you don't need me because...

01:03:21.254 --> 01:03:23.353
- Na'ama, I...
- Because you...

01:03:23.355 --> 01:03:25.123
- You really do!
- Na'ama!

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:27.759
Yes, say it. I'm listening.

01:03:27.761 --> 01:03:29.861
Come on. Spit it out.

01:03:29.863 --> 01:03:30.864
Thank you.

01:03:35.201 --> 01:03:36.837
It's a trap!

01:03:59.593 --> 01:04:00.493
Kinglet!

01:04:01.093 --> 01:04:02.195
No.

01:04:07.167 --> 01:04:10.471
That's exactly
what I was waiting for.

01:04:25.518 --> 01:04:27.451
What?

01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:31.656
The old beggar.
He's the Shamir, the stone worm.

01:04:33.526 --> 01:04:36.960
If you want to live,
then get in here.

01:04:36.962 --> 01:04:39.365
Come on. Come on. Hurry up.

01:04:45.372 --> 01:04:47.875
I always knew
he was hiding something.

01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:05.659
Come on. We're going further in.

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:18.471
Where to? I can't see
my hand in front of my face.

01:05:23.176 --> 01:05:25.712
This way if you agree.

01:05:44.997 --> 01:05:46.029
Uh-huh.

01:05:46.031 --> 01:05:48.266
I think we've shaken off
the soldiers.

01:05:48.268 --> 01:05:50.201
So, you're the stone worm?

01:05:50.203 --> 01:05:52.636
Shamir, if you don't mind.

01:05:52.638 --> 01:05:55.605
You tricked us
good and proper, old man.

01:05:55.607 --> 01:05:58.009
You never once
asked my name.

01:05:58.011 --> 01:06:00.143
How long
were you hiding in Petra?

01:06:00.145 --> 01:06:02.714
Since I carved the city of rock

01:06:02.716 --> 01:06:04.415
for King Salim.

01:06:10.723 --> 01:06:11.691
Huh?

01:06:26.605 --> 01:06:29.373
Well,
old man, awake at last.

01:06:29.375 --> 01:06:30.841
Just in time...

01:06:30.843 --> 01:06:34.645
Mercy, master. A cave...
A cave appeared from nowhere.

01:06:34.647 --> 01:06:37.418
Cave? What sort of a cave?

01:06:37.683 --> 01:06:39.116
Show me.

01:06:39.118 --> 01:06:42.185
A cave opened up where
there was no crack in the rock.

01:06:42.187 --> 01:06:45.390
That can only mean one thing.

01:06:45.392 --> 01:06:47.660
The stone worm.

01:06:50.629 --> 01:06:53.431
Jerusalem was
always a tough town.

01:06:53.433 --> 01:06:56.837
But this?
This is taking things too far.

01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:01.304
Have you
come back again, Solomon?

01:07:01.306 --> 01:07:03.975
Yes. I've returned to banish you

01:07:03.977 --> 01:07:05.509
to your underground dungeon.

01:07:05.511 --> 01:07:07.578
Huh?

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.313
And who will help you?
Let's look.

01:07:10.315 --> 01:07:12.150
A flea-bitten fox,

01:07:12.152 --> 01:07:16.053
a frail girl
and an elderly beggar.

01:07:40.113 --> 01:07:43.281
The demon king's dogs from hell.

01:07:43.283 --> 01:07:46.116
He must be immensely powerful

01:07:46.118 --> 01:07:47.685
if he could summon them.

01:07:47.687 --> 01:07:51.158
Relax. There is
plenty for everyone.

01:07:52.292 --> 01:07:54.891
What's that?

01:07:54.893 --> 01:07:58.899
Your Highness.
What are you doing here?

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.400
All you ever
think about is eating.

01:08:03.402 --> 01:08:06.904
You are mistaken,
my furry friend.

01:08:06.906 --> 01:08:08.772
I'm not eating.

01:08:08.774 --> 01:08:10.743
I'm feeding.

01:08:11.611 --> 01:08:15.114
Look, Solomon.
A whole army of escapees.

01:08:25.558 --> 01:08:29.359
Hate can only be defeated
by the army of the meek.

01:08:29.362 --> 01:08:30.727
My army.

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:34.365
But they haven't got
any swords or spears.

01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:35.832
Look at them, Kinglet.

01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:38.602
I thought that all you needed
in order to rule was

01:08:38.604 --> 01:08:40.569
a throne and a ring.

01:08:40.572 --> 01:08:43.876
And that being David's son
was enough to be a good king.

01:08:44.844 --> 01:08:46.477
But now I know,

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:49.578
that true power
doesn't come from a ring.

01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:52.649
And that true loyalty
doesn't live in a throne,

01:08:52.652 --> 01:08:54.654
but in all of you.

01:08:58.090 --> 01:08:59.856
Please come to me.

01:08:59.858 --> 01:09:03.060
Birds and beasts
of this beautiful land.

01:09:23.215 --> 01:09:24.814
One elephant.

01:09:24.817 --> 01:09:27.051
Is that the best you could do?

01:09:27.053 --> 01:09:28.488
You foolish child.

01:09:33.593 --> 01:09:36.595
Don't leave me out
of the action, you big lump.

01:09:38.363 --> 01:09:43.533
Do you think there'll be a
victory feast after the battle?

01:09:43.536 --> 01:09:46.770
But of course.
Either for us or from us.

01:09:46.773 --> 01:09:48.642
But there's bound to be one.

01:09:49.408 --> 01:09:50.844
Attack!

01:09:59.152 --> 01:10:01.788
Kill them all. Destroy them.

01:10:32.385 --> 01:10:33.286
Go.

01:10:36.355 --> 01:10:38.422
Don't you dare run away.

01:10:38.424 --> 01:10:40.794
Curse you. Carry on fighting.

01:10:43.062 --> 01:10:44.631
Bird's, cover them.

01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:51.238
Stop. No further.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.873
They're still my people,

01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:58.642
even if they have been poisoned
by hatred.

01:10:58.644 --> 01:11:00.543
I need to get closer

01:11:00.545 --> 01:11:02.812
in order to open the ground

01:11:02.814 --> 01:11:05.685
and send the demon back to hell.

01:11:08.453 --> 01:11:10.754
- Hey.
- Oh, look.

01:11:10.756 --> 01:11:12.893
It's the nanny from Sheba.

01:11:15.028 --> 01:11:16.560
Hey, slow down.

01:11:16.562 --> 01:11:19.496
- Who is this girl?
- Oh, her?

01:11:19.498 --> 01:11:21.565
She's Queen Bilqis.

01:11:21.567 --> 01:11:23.700
A very pretty straw crown
you have on.

01:11:23.702 --> 01:11:25.168
And who is she?

01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:29.106
Oh, um...
She's just a girl from Petra.

01:11:29.108 --> 01:11:31.042
Just a girl?

01:11:31.044 --> 01:11:33.043
Well, not exactly.

01:11:33.045 --> 01:11:36.347
She's Princess Na'ama,
the daughter of King Salim.

01:11:36.349 --> 01:11:37.481
Humpf.

01:11:37.483 --> 01:11:39.549
There is no time
for this now, girls.

01:11:39.551 --> 01:11:41.252
Solomon. You know the way.

01:11:41.254 --> 01:11:43.357
Thank you. Come on, Shamir.

01:11:45.957 --> 01:11:48.191
Where are you, child king?

01:11:48.193 --> 01:11:50.895
So that I might see
your pale face.

01:11:50.897 --> 01:11:53.698
Perhaps you'd better
turn around, demon.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.167
How did you get here?

01:11:56.169 --> 01:11:59.203
Stop. I know you're
gonna tear me apart.

01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:02.341
Because you are
a strong and mighty demon.

01:12:03.009 --> 01:12:04.575
Clever boy.

01:12:04.577 --> 01:12:07.477
If you're willing
to grant me a final wish,

01:12:07.479 --> 01:12:09.045
I will give you the Shamir.

01:12:09.047 --> 01:12:14.218
Are you saying that you have the
stone worm trapped in that bag?

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.954
If I let it out, it'll escape
in the blink of an eye.

01:12:17.956 --> 01:12:19.923
Be careful with that bag.

01:12:19.925 --> 01:12:21.691
Hold the top shut tight.

01:12:21.693 --> 01:12:23.526
And pass it here to me.

01:12:23.528 --> 01:12:25.562
You first have to promise

01:12:25.564 --> 01:12:26.896
to release Jehoshafat.

01:12:26.898 --> 01:12:28.598
Don't do it, Solomon.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.069
Is that all you ask?

01:12:32.071 --> 01:12:35.039
Look into my eyes
and make your promise.

01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:38.875
- Well...
- If you waste anymore time, I'll let it go.

01:12:38.877 --> 01:12:41.846
Shamir for Jehoshafat, you say?

01:12:41.848 --> 01:12:44.147
No, no, no, Solomon.

01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:45.449
Don't be a fool.

01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:47.918
Silence. Very well,

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.686
give me the stone worm.

01:12:49.688 --> 01:12:51.755
And after I've torn you apart

01:12:51.757 --> 01:12:54.258
Jehoshafat will be free to go.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:56.627
Do you promise? Hmm?

01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:57.927
Are you sure?

01:12:57.929 --> 01:12:59.730
Of course, I'm sure.

01:12:59.732 --> 01:13:01.468
Now give me that bag.

01:13:05.438 --> 01:13:07.637
Take it and hold it tight.

01:13:07.639 --> 01:13:09.408
Or else it's sure to escape.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:10.975
Ha-ha.

01:13:10.977 --> 01:13:13.511
You are mine at last, Shamir.

01:13:13.513 --> 01:13:15.646
Kinglet, run!

01:13:15.648 --> 01:13:17.515
You tricked me, Solomon.

01:13:17.517 --> 01:13:20.183
Yuck. He's got chicken legs.

01:13:20.185 --> 01:13:21.353
Ew!

01:13:22.554 --> 01:13:23.989
Help me, Hadad.

01:13:25.491 --> 01:13:28.127
This isn't yours, Demon.

01:13:58.523 --> 01:14:00.089
Forgive me, King Solomon,

01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:02.726
for my thirst for revenge.

01:14:02.728 --> 01:14:05.862
And you forgive me
for my father's crime

01:14:05.864 --> 01:14:07.397
that you sought to avenge.

01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:10.700
But we two
can put an end to this strife.

01:14:10.702 --> 01:14:13.603
Hence, so I give you this gift

01:14:13.605 --> 01:14:15.172
as a permanent sign,

01:14:15.174 --> 01:14:18.511
the ring is yours
that once was mine.

01:14:35.161 --> 01:14:38.561
They said you wanted
to talk to me?

01:14:38.563 --> 01:14:40.366
Oh, Solomon, at last.

01:14:40.899 --> 01:14:42.799
How does this look?

01:14:42.801 --> 01:14:45.102
Beautiful. Just like you.

01:14:45.104 --> 01:14:47.070
Oh, it's just a cheap rag.

01:14:47.072 --> 01:14:50.042
I hardly brought a thing
with me from Sheba.

01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:53.744
Why did you call for me, Bilqis?

01:14:53.746 --> 01:14:55.515
Oh, it's about the wedding.

01:14:55.814 --> 01:14:56.946
Wedding?

01:14:56.948 --> 01:14:58.818
Our wedding, of course.

01:14:59.684 --> 01:15:01.554
Isn't that the will
of our people?

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.788
Sure it is. I mean, maybe.

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:05.722
But, uh...

01:15:05.724 --> 01:15:07.691
Peach or turquoise?

01:15:07.693 --> 01:15:09.192
Bilqis, I...

01:15:09.194 --> 01:15:11.594
You know what? Don't say a word.

01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:13.731
I've been thinking. And...

01:15:13.733 --> 01:15:16.036
let's depart
as friends, instead.

01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:18.435
A wedding for me

01:15:18.437 --> 01:15:20.003
means true love.

01:15:20.005 --> 01:15:22.972
So, what are you saying, Bilqis?

01:15:22.974 --> 01:15:26.744
That our friendship
is indeed precious.

01:15:26.746 --> 01:15:29.946
I am sure
our paths will cross again.

01:15:29.948 --> 01:15:32.184
I fell in love, Bilqis.

01:15:32.751 --> 01:15:33.750
With me?

01:15:33.752 --> 01:15:36.253
With a girl
who was born a princess,

01:15:36.255 --> 01:15:38.655
whose heart is pure
and whose spirit

01:15:38.657 --> 01:15:41.025
is free as a desert breeze.

01:15:41.027 --> 01:15:42.692
A girl who stayed with me

01:15:42.694 --> 01:15:45.130
when I was a nobody or nothing.

01:15:47.366 --> 01:15:48.865
A true love?

01:15:48.867 --> 01:15:52.238
Aww. That is so romantic.

01:15:52.837 --> 01:15:55.274
- Na'ama? I...
- Yes.

01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:02.012
Rejoice, Jerusalem.

01:16:02.014 --> 01:16:04.981
Wise Solomon is now a man

01:16:04.983 --> 01:16:08.451
and once again
the King of all the land.

01:16:56.635 --> 01:17:00.236
<i>The golden age
of peace was here at last.</i>

01:17:00.238 --> 01:17:04.607
<i>And it would be many a year
before it passed.</i>

01:17:04.609 --> 01:17:07.945
<i>And who was the one
who got it sorted</i>

01:17:07.947 --> 01:17:09.279
<i>with no fear?</i>

01:17:09.281 --> 01:17:13.185
Oh, Tobby, of course,
the furry fox hero.
