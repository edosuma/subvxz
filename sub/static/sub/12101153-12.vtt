WEBVTT

00:06.963 --> 00:09.748
Do you have the location
of the Totem yet?

00:09.792 --> 00:12.273
No... we don't.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.493
Something's off

00:18.105 --> 00:19.410
What could have gone wrong?

00:36.558 --> 00:38.777
Hey, Joey!
I'm just checking in.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.824
Hi, Kelly! I'm taking my friend
to see our new place.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.653
Orlando says I'm gonna have
my own room and everything.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.655
[Kelly] I'm so happy for you--

00:46.698 --> 00:48.613
-[exploding]
-[Joey screaming]

00:48.657 --> 00:49.745
Joey?

00:54.967 --> 00:56.665
[theme music playing]

01:00.495 --> 01:02.845
[people clamoring]

01:08.372 --> 01:10.113
Ma'am, let me help you...

01:10.157 --> 01:11.462
It's okay.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.681
Call 911.

01:13.725 --> 01:14.813
[Joey] Help...

01:14.857 --> 01:15.814
Joey!

01:18.643 --> 01:19.818
Can you sit up?

01:20.819 --> 01:23.257
Ayesha... my friend...

01:23.300 --> 01:25.172
Okay. Okay, you're okay.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.912
Help is on the way.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.305
-[Joey] Orlando...
-[Orlando] Joey!

01:30.612 --> 01:33.136
-How did this happen?
-I don't know.
But someone called 911.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.747
-They'll be here soon.
-To the Heights?

01:35.791 --> 01:37.967
By the time they get here,
people won't make it.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.621
I can't breathe.

01:39.664 --> 01:40.796
I'll take him.

01:40.839 --> 01:42.145
You guys come on.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.407
Okay, I've got you.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.148
Come on.
We're gonna go this way.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.978
[hospital staff
chattering indistinctly]

01:50.197 --> 01:52.199
Sit over there, okay?

01:52.242 --> 01:54.592
Hi. Excuse me. Hi.
This child can't breathe.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.466
[breathing heavily]

01:58.509 --> 02:00.337
[announcer on PA]
Code blue. Room 305.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.470
Everyone near the collapsed
building inhaled a lot of dust.

02:02.513 --> 02:05.168
They're all experiencing
these same symptoms.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.127
Okay, so we need
oxygen tanks, respirators--

02:07.170 --> 02:09.390
We don't have enough.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.869
It's worst case first.
We have a 60-year-old
grandmother on a respirator,

02:10.913 --> 02:12.828
a 40-year-old-father
who's unresponsive,

02:12.871 --> 02:14.786
and ten more cases
just has bad.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.397
So unless you can
get me 100 respirators
and a dozen nurses,

02:16.440 --> 02:18.094
he's just going
to have to wait.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.835
Doctor, We've got another one
from the implosion.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.576
The Ormfell building.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.969
We have another opportunity
with Orquoia.

02:24.013 --> 02:26.015
Let's schedule
a City Council vote--

02:26.058 --> 02:28.104
Why did you bring me here?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.410
-Well, this was
the closest hospital--
-No, you have to take--

02:29.453 --> 02:31.368
Councilwoman Rankin,
are you okay?

02:31.412 --> 02:35.764
Yes, I'm... I will be fine.
Thank you so much
for your concern.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.983
'Cause the hospital's
overwhelmed.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.203
They've run out of beds,
and they really need
more equipment and more aid.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.945
Don't think I would take
any bed from anyone here.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.556
I'm gonna make some calls.
Let's go and open up a bed

02:45.600 --> 02:47.863
for one of the good people
of this community.

02:47.906 --> 02:50.082
Thank you so much
for bringing my attention to it

02:51.780 --> 02:56.524
She said she'd help...
and she just left.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.568
[Orlando] Of course she did.

02:59.004 --> 03:02.443
Aren't you friends
with Supergirl?

03:02.486 --> 03:05.402
She got the council
listening to me about
the Ormfell building.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.144
-Maybe she can help here.
-Yeah.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.149
[phone ringing]

03:13.193 --> 03:16.065
Hey, babe, it's not
really a good time.
Can I call you back?

03:16.108 --> 03:18.372
Joey was at the
Ormfell building
when it came down.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.244
-What-- Is he okay?
-I-- I don't know. It's bad.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.115
The hospital is overwhelmed,

03:23.159 --> 03:24.856
they've run out
of respirators and
oxygen tanks. I...

03:24.900 --> 03:26.206
[sighs]

03:26.249 --> 03:27.381
Can you guys come?

03:27.424 --> 03:29.557
Look, I... I totally get it.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.907
And as soon as we get a break,
we'll head to the Heights.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.083
We're dealing
with something huge here.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.781
I have some med school friends
that work at other hospitals.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.479
I'll see if they can send
some respirators over.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.785
Uh, that would be amazing.

03:40.829 --> 03:45.181
Um, I have to go. I'm so sorry,
but you are amazing.
You can do anything.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.269
-I love you.
-I...

03:51.013 --> 03:53.755
-You inhaled a great amount
of particulate matter.
-[Rankin coughing]

03:53.798 --> 03:55.409
You just have to rest.

03:55.452 --> 03:59.282
Resting is not an option.
I need to get back to work.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.284
I heard about that...
What was it? RP-90.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.939
That new drug for
respiratory issues,
you can give that to me.

04:03.982 --> 04:07.769
RP-90 is still
very much in trials
and extremely expensive.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.075
Oh. Come here.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.948
You tell your
chief of medicine [coughs]

04:12.991 --> 04:15.385
that if he wants
those healthcare grants

04:15.429 --> 04:18.649
approved by City Council,
then I get the medicine.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.306
[sighs wearily]

04:23.350 --> 04:24.612
[coughing]

04:29.181 --> 04:30.313
[machine beeping]

04:30.357 --> 04:32.663
Excuse me. Can someone...

04:36.885 --> 04:38.452
Hey. Hi.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.628
Um, that child cannot breathe,
we need some help.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.370
I'm sorry. We're doing
the best we can.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.503
[reporter on TV]
That was the scene downtown
as Supergirl saved the city

04:46.547 --> 04:49.289
from one ferocious
feline yesterday.

04:49.332 --> 04:53.162
Since then, it's the only
news people have been
talking about...

04:53.205 --> 04:57.471
-[reporter continues
indistinctly]
-[breathing raggedly]

05:01.562 --> 05:02.867
[voicemail beeping]

05:02.911 --> 05:04.913
Hey, James...

05:06.393 --> 05:10.571
Um, I am at a hospital
in the Heights.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.749
There was an explosion.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.141
People are gonna die...

05:18.361 --> 05:20.407
And it's like no one cares.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.498
It's like their lives
don't matter.

05:27.414 --> 05:31.853
Um, I just... I needed to vent
to someone that I knew
would get it.

05:34.290 --> 05:37.032
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I just, um...

05:39.469 --> 05:40.992
I don't know how you did it.

05:43.734 --> 05:46.084
Because I'm already so tired.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.436
[crying]

05:49.479 --> 05:53.135
I am exhausted.

05:53.178 --> 05:57.182
[Kelly] I feel like
I can't get anyone
to see the real problem.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.538
It's like they're just focused
on themselves.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.587
[groans] Ow.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.855
[gasps]

06:19.509 --> 06:21.511
I feel so powerless.

06:21.555 --> 06:24.732
Everyone here is so powerless.

06:26.473 --> 06:32.957
These are someone's child,
mothers, brothers...

06:33.001 --> 06:35.525
And I'm scared
it's only gonna get worse.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.571
And I don't know
what else to do.

06:41.575 --> 06:45.274
Focus your mind,
focus your energy.

06:45.317 --> 06:48.146
Speak what you want
into existence.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.019
Ignis...

06:52.281 --> 06:53.761
Oh!

06:53.804 --> 06:55.371
Florence, I am so sorry.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.459
I-- I could've hurt you.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.679
Oh, it's fine. We'll try again.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.202
[phone vibrating]

07:00.985 --> 07:01.986
Hold on.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.297
I've got to go.
My friends are
in serious danger.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.864
I gotta get home.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.910
Lena, take this book.
Don't deny who you are.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.610
[exhaling]

07:16.653 --> 07:18.612
I X-rayed the entire city.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.918
There's no sign of her
or Mitch's ship.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.964
When we put that
anti-magic cuff on Nyxly,

07:23.007 --> 07:25.401
it made it impossible
for us to track her.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.882
Maybe it's not Nyxly
we should be looking for.

07:27.925 --> 07:30.667
Mxy is still full
of 5th dimensional energies.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.582
The crystal is dampening
his energy signature,

07:32.626 --> 07:35.672
but perhaps we can modulate
the tower sensors

07:35.716 --> 07:37.500
to isolate his
specific wavelength.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.154
There might be more information

07:39.197 --> 07:41.461
on 5th dimensional energy
at the DEO's Desert Facility

07:41.504 --> 07:43.027
to help me build a tracker.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.464
Well, we'll need Alex's
retina scan to get in.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.987
-I'll give you a ride.
-Okay.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.947
Is everything okay?

07:49.991 --> 07:51.993
Yeah. I was just gonna go home
and check on Kelly,

07:52.036 --> 07:58.042
-but, I'm sure
she's got it covered.
-All right.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.305
[reporter on TV]
Traffic is still
backed up for miles,

08:00.349 --> 08:02.133
due to a building collapse
in the Heights...

08:02.177 --> 08:06.442
Andrea, traffic! Your network
is focusing on the traffic?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.923
Kelly, our viewers
care about traffic.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.578
A lot of people are suffering
because of that Ormfell
collapse in the Heights.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.667
If you covered
what they were going through,

08:13.710 --> 08:16.844
it would bring needed attention
and assistance.

08:16.887 --> 08:20.325
I know my demographic and the
Heights is just not newsworthy.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.413
-I'm sorry, Kelly.
-[line disconnects]

08:26.288 --> 08:27.550
[knocking at door]

08:29.683 --> 08:34.426
-Kelly Olsen, right?
-And your John Diggle
from Star City.

08:34.470 --> 08:39.649
Well, I'm in Metropolis these
days, but yes. James sent me.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.391
I didn't realize
you and Jimmy were in touch.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.567
Yeah, well, we talk
from time to time.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.527
We both have worked with
some pretty spectacular people,

08:47.570 --> 08:49.703
have similar struggles.

08:49.746 --> 08:52.836
He called and told me
what was happening here.

08:55.447 --> 08:59.060
He also thought there was
a better chance you would
listen to me than him.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.365
[chuckling] Oh!

09:00.409 --> 09:04.065
I listen to him. Sometimes.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.894
Well, look, I... I'm...
I'm glad you're here.

09:06.937 --> 09:10.419
The situation in
the Heights is a mess.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.030
Honestly, he sounded
more worried about you,

09:13.074 --> 09:15.119
about how you're taking it all.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.948
I'm fine. I've overcome
a lot in my life.

09:17.992 --> 09:21.299
I just want to make sure
the people in the Heights
get the help they need.

09:21.343 --> 09:24.128
And I'm not sure that there's
a military solution here.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.609
I see. I heard you served, too.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.785
-I did.
-You know that life.

09:28.829 --> 09:31.266
Sometimes on the battlefield,
you do what you have to
to survive.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.007
You just keep going.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.748
Push yourself so hard
that you miss the warning signs

09:34.791 --> 09:37.446
that maybe something
deeper is going on.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.535
I'm not questioning
your strength,

09:39.579 --> 09:42.016
but I do want you to know
I'm here for you.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.888
Looking at those people
at the hospital last night,

09:46.324 --> 09:50.285
knowing how badly
they're struggling...

09:50.328 --> 09:54.332
And no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't help them.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.293
So you feel alone in this?

09:58.336 --> 10:03.211
Alex sent respirators
to the hospital,
but the rest of the team...

10:03.254 --> 10:05.779
Well, they have
super villains to deal with.

10:05.822 --> 10:09.783
Oliver Queen was really good
at seeing the big picture,

10:09.826 --> 10:13.438
but sometimes, because of that,
he would overlook things.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.832
When I wanted to show him
something he missed,

10:15.876 --> 10:19.444
sometimes he would
require proof.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.796
-Wish it didn't always
require proof.
-I know. Tell me about it.

10:24.275 --> 10:28.497
But right now, Kelly,
what do you know?

10:28.540 --> 10:31.326
I know something is making
the people in the Heights sick,

10:31.369 --> 10:35.112
and I know it's something more
than just that Ormfell building
coming down.

10:35.156 --> 10:39.856
Okay. Best place to start
is at the source. Let's go.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.213
People were just
about to move in.

10:49.257 --> 10:52.216
Have new lives, new homes.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.568
How is anyone
ever gonna recover?

10:57.569 --> 10:58.875
They'll find a way.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.573
We always do.

11:02.487 --> 11:03.663
What is that?

11:14.108 --> 11:15.370
[door creaks]

11:20.592 --> 11:24.640
And just like that, it's gone.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.078
Now we have a second chance.

11:31.038 --> 11:34.476
No building, no commitment
to affordable housing.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.174
[inhales and exhales]

11:37.218 --> 11:40.090
That treatment I got has me
feeling amazing and hungry.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.136
I would kill for a sandwich
right now.

11:46.836 --> 11:47.924
I did that?

11:53.408 --> 11:57.586
I... I thought about it
and then it appeared.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.371
I could transform
this entire neighborhood.

12:05.942 --> 12:09.337
I need real 5th dimensional
elements to lock onto Mxy.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.034
Tell me you found some.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.733
No, but we did find
something else that might help.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.082
Baltorian scanners.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.171
They're portable
and able to trace

12:17.214 --> 12:19.608
even minute amounts
of 5th dimensional energy.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.176
Interesting.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.178
[machine beeping]

12:24.221 --> 12:27.224
Sprock, it's already
found a source of
5th dimensional energy.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.489
-Is that the Ormfell?
-The one Nyxly blew up?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.970
You don't think she'd return to
the scene of the crime, do you?

12:41.630 --> 12:43.501
[Brainy] Be careful, Supergirl.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.547
Nyxly re-powered
herself once before,
she could do it again.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.244
I'm not letting
her get away this time.

12:50.682 --> 12:53.990
Kelly? Dig?
What are you guys doing here?

12:54.034 --> 12:55.818
We came back here to see
if we could identify

12:55.862 --> 12:57.864
what was making
the people in the Heights sick.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.953
A.R.G.U.S. stands
at the ready but this
is pretty otherworldly.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.737
More your deal than mine.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.218
Nyxly, an imp, bent on
world domination built a device

13:04.261 --> 13:06.307
that we thought would freeze
half of National City.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.832
And I blew it up.
At least that's what
I thought I was doing.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.486
Instead Supergirl
powered up the device

13:11.529 --> 13:14.315
that infused Nyxly
with 5th dimensional energy.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.970
That same energy also infused
into the building itself.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.841
And when Nyxly destroyed it--

13:18.885 --> 13:21.061
It spread the dust and debris
throughout the neighborhood.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.845
Hey, you okay?

13:22.889 --> 13:25.239
I'm glad you're here.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.763
The contaminated debris is
radiating small amounts of
5th dimensional energy.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.547
It's what's making
people here sick.

13:29.591 --> 13:32.202
Our scanners will help us
locate the debris.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.770
All together, they should make
for a powerful energy source.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.728
And that will give us
what we need to find Nyxly?

13:36.772 --> 13:38.643
-[Brainy] I believe so.
-But will it help the people

13:38.687 --> 13:39.906
here in the Heights?

13:39.949 --> 13:41.646
Removing the
contaminated debris

13:41.690 --> 13:43.344
should lead to the people
recovering almost immediately.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.389
[Kelly] Great. Everybody wins.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.960
Things have changed
with the Ormfell building gone.

13:51.004 --> 13:54.616
Now we can have five new
tech companies in there,
instead of just one.

13:54.659 --> 13:57.358
We have a real
opportunity, Councilwoman.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.186
We need a new vote.

13:59.229 --> 14:01.536
The people in your district
seemed to really need housing.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.887
The people in my district
don't know what's really
good for them.

14:04.931 --> 14:10.197
Wouldn't you like
to have your whole
re-election campaign funded.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.328
Sure, who wouldn't?

14:13.504 --> 14:14.592
Don't worry about it.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.380
That's just the beginning
if you vote with me.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.000
-[breathing heavily]
-[machine beeping]

14:47.103 --> 14:49.627
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.195
Pressure and debris from the
Ormfell building coming down

14:52.239 --> 14:55.851
-caused damage
all over the community.
-It's awful.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.245
Neighborhoods like this
get less resources and support,

14:58.288 --> 15:01.117
so it takes them
longer to recover.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.337
Many times, it's just people
in the community

15:03.380 --> 15:06.340
desperately trying
to help themselves.
They need help.

15:06.383 --> 15:10.648
Well, Nyxly will pay
for what she did.
I'll make sure of it.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.477
And once we get Mxy back,
he'll be able
to fix everything.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.306
He can just snap his fingers
and put everything back
to the way it was.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.961
-But the way it was, wasn't--
-[machine whirring]

15:19.005 --> 15:22.095
Oh. Looks like
it found some more
contaminated debris.

15:22.138 --> 15:26.012
Once it's gone, we will
get things back to normal.
I promise.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.668
[phone ringing]

15:35.456 --> 15:38.807
Hey, Orlando, how's Joey? What?

15:40.983 --> 15:43.725
-I'll be there soon.
-Hey, babe.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.771
Hey, I feel like we haven't
really talked in days.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.905
Yeah, I know.
It's been so intense
trying to find Nyxly.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.820
My friend called and said
that the respirators

15:51.863 --> 15:53.865
made it to
Chisholm Memorial Hospital.

15:53.909 --> 15:57.739
Yes, thank you.
But I think it's more
complicated than that.

15:57.782 --> 16:01.395
Orlando just called
and Joey should be
getting better. And he's not.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.179
I'm worried
we're missing something.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.181
-[Supergirl over comm] Alex.
-Yeah, go.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.618
We got the last of the debris
to calibrate our sensors.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.490
We need to get back to the
tower ASAP.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.970
All right, I'll be right there.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.275
Supergirl said that
we've got all the debris

16:12.319 --> 16:14.321
that should help everyone here.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.584
Dreamer, we have to
get to the tower.

16:22.546 --> 16:25.723
Here. Take mine.
Maybe we did miss something.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.377
Thank you.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.604
-Hey.
-I, uh...

16:36.647 --> 16:38.519
I keep telling the doctors
he's getting worse,

16:38.562 --> 16:40.390
but no one's listening.

16:40.434 --> 16:43.306
-They keep saying
he should be fine.
-I feel really bad.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.005
I know. We're going to
figure this out, Joey.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.180
I promise.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.877
[machine whirring]

16:51.140 --> 16:54.535
Have the nurse check him again.
As long as he's sick,
keep pushing.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.579
Okay.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.453
[beeping]

17:00.802 --> 17:03.152
[beeping intensifies]

17:03.196 --> 17:04.762
[Kelly] How's Rankin
so much better?

17:04.806 --> 17:06.547
Who's that?

17:06.590 --> 17:08.114
She's the councilwoman that
represents the neighborhood.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.072
Although, she's
more focused on gentrifying it

17:10.116 --> 17:12.379
than helping her constituents.

17:12.422 --> 17:17.384
She was near the building
when it imploded and was
here sick the other night.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.908
She looks fine now.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.171
She's reading high levels
of 5th dimensional energy.

17:22.215 --> 17:24.086
We need to get her
back to the tower.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.784
-She must be connected
to all of this.
-Who's connected?

17:29.178 --> 17:33.269
-Rankin, again.
-Orlando, don't!

17:33.313 --> 17:35.228
You may need to suit up.

17:35.271 --> 17:39.188
Yes, the disaster
two nights ago
was horrible for all of us.

17:39.232 --> 17:44.411
But as you can see, I'm back
working for this community.

17:44.454 --> 17:47.936
I'm hearing that there are
still people in the hospital
injured from the explosion.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.591
All I can say is I feel great.

17:50.634 --> 17:51.983
I'm back on my feet,

17:52.027 --> 17:53.811
and I'm here to show everyone

17:53.855 --> 17:56.597
that they shouldn't let their
own weakness hold them back.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.252
So you just got better, huh?
Just like that?

17:59.295 --> 18:01.515
I'm not taking questions
from the public right now.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.299
[Orlando] I watched you
leave the hospital.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.519
You get some fancy treatment
and get better?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.652
What about my brother?

18:08.696 --> 18:10.741
What about all the people
in that hospital?

18:10.785 --> 18:12.917
I want to help the people
of this community.

18:12.961 --> 18:16.138
I want to help you
pull yourselves up
by your own bootstraps.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.879
It's not us
who are the problem,

18:17.922 --> 18:21.143
it's you and the whole system
that supports you.

18:21.187 --> 18:25.495
The same system that
puts us down while it tells us
to pull ourselves up.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.149
People deserve better.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.328
[whispering] Get me
out of here.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.027
Stop.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.900
Take care of them.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.554
[Kelly] I'll get Rankin,
you stay here!

18:44.035 --> 18:45.254
[Diggle grunting]

18:59.355 --> 19:01.183
There is something
wrong with you.

19:01.227 --> 19:05.056
There's nothing wrong with me.
Everything is finally right.

19:07.972 --> 19:08.843
[grunts]

19:11.019 --> 19:13.848
-You have to stop!
-I won't be stopped by you.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.897
You're not strong enough.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.259
[device beeping]

19:34.695 --> 19:37.132
With all of this,
we'll be able to find Mxy.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.048
Good.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.833
-Where were all of you?
-Kelly? What happened?

19:42.877 --> 19:46.707
Rankin is the problem.
She's a source of
the 5th dimensional energy,

19:46.750 --> 19:50.711
and I don't know how or why.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.670
There was a fight
at the hospital and
I couldn't stop her.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.238
Kelly managed to grab
some of Rankin's hair.

19:56.282 --> 19:59.676
-Kelly--
-I needed your help.

19:59.720 --> 20:03.593
I told you the people
in the Heights needed your help
and you didn't see them.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.335
-You don't see me.
-Kelly, I see--

20:09.991 --> 20:11.645
We're gonna stop
the person who did this.

20:11.688 --> 20:15.083
I know! I know that you're
all trying to stop Nyxly.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.173
I know. But do you hear me?

20:19.783 --> 20:21.611
Do you see what is happening?

20:23.265 --> 20:26.225
People are gonna die!

20:26.268 --> 20:28.749
And I feel like
I am yelling into a void!

20:30.533 --> 20:34.233
We're supposed to fight
for everyone, together.

20:34.276 --> 20:39.194
And yet, I am looking
at people suffer,
people that look like me

20:40.369 --> 20:43.807
and everyone here
is just too busy.

20:43.851 --> 20:48.203
Where is the outrage
that people are gonna die
without help?

20:49.683 --> 20:51.859
Without hope?

20:51.902 --> 20:53.991
Maybe you could
spare a second for them.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.694
I'll, uh, I'll go after her.

21:00.737 --> 21:01.912
-I'll go with you.
-Wait.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.786
Let's just give her a second.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.004
Until she's ready.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.456
Sorry about that.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.848
I don't know
what just happened.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.241
No need to apologize.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.635
[grunts]

21:28.678 --> 21:29.940
You wanna talk about
what's really going on?

21:34.858 --> 21:36.860
I am not one to be hopeless.

21:40.037 --> 21:43.432
I just don't know
how to express
what I'm feeling.

21:43.476 --> 21:44.651
And I'm a psychologist.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.132
I just want to
make a difference.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.962
But I am one person
fighting a system

21:52.006 --> 21:55.531
that has been against those
that need it for centuries.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.795
And we have been
fighting for centuries.

21:58.839 --> 22:02.059
Fighting through exhaustion,
fighting through being tired,

22:02.103 --> 22:04.584
fighting to get things right,
but now is not the time

22:04.627 --> 22:06.325
to walk away from this fight.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.590
Use your exhaustion
to fuel your fire.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.899
I've carried racial trauma
like breath.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.553
So I know what you're carrying.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.992
I had an opportunity to become
a special kind of hero.

22:23.994 --> 22:27.824
But it would've meant
me leaving Lyla, my kids,

22:27.868 --> 22:29.522
and everything I love behind.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.221
So I had to ask myself...

22:33.264 --> 22:36.224
what kind of a hero
do I really want to be.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.573
So the question is...

22:39.575 --> 22:44.058
what are you gonna do with what
you're feeling right now?

22:44.101 --> 22:46.930
I want to be an advocate
for the people
who have lost hope.

22:49.759 --> 22:53.415
For the people
who have been failed
by those meant to protect them.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.899
For the people who don't have
heroes that look like them.

22:58.942 --> 23:02.206
Protecting those
that are exhausted,

23:02.250 --> 23:05.558
so they don't have to
fight every single day
for themselves.

23:06.863 --> 23:07.864
Good.

23:09.953 --> 23:10.954
Let that guide you.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.004
-I'm sorry, I--
-It's okay.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.143
Kelly, I'm so sorry.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.720
I have, um...

23:40.506 --> 23:43.987
I have pushed down
so much trauma that
the Heights has brought up.

23:46.512 --> 23:50.341
I have pushed it down
and smiled,

23:50.385 --> 23:51.691
and stayed friendly,

23:52.996 --> 23:54.998
and stayed positive,

23:55.042 --> 23:56.870
even when it didn't feel right.

23:58.915 --> 24:02.266
Even when people's lives
were being discarded.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.532
You push it down
and you keep going.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.536
And over time, that gets...

24:11.450 --> 24:12.581
exhausting.

24:16.846 --> 24:21.416
You may not get it,
but I need you
to understand that it exists.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.374
It's important.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.769
People need hope.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.337
And there's a whole group
of people with none.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.906
No hope in hospitals,
no hope in police,

24:32.949 --> 24:34.821
and no hope in superheroes.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.910
I was just so desperately
trying to catch Nyxly,

24:36.953 --> 24:38.955
because I know she would
cause more damage.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.827
[Kelly] Yes, in the future.

24:40.870 --> 24:45.527
But while you all have the
luxury of focusing on tomorrow,

24:45.571 --> 24:48.051
they are barely
surviving today.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.880
I don't know how I missed this.

24:55.319 --> 24:56.756
I really do care.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.106
Like, when Agent Liberty
was targeting aliens,

24:59.149 --> 25:00.934
I marched amongst the aliens.

25:00.977 --> 25:03.676
But you are an alien.

25:03.719 --> 25:07.157
You were activated in a fight
that was close to you.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.203
I mean, just like I was
in the Heights.

25:10.378 --> 25:12.075
Sometimes you are
gonna miss things

25:12.119 --> 25:14.687
because they are different
than your lived experience.

25:14.730 --> 25:17.559
It doesn't necessarily
make you a bad person,

25:17.603 --> 25:20.083
but we really
need to hear each other.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.088
What can I do to help?

25:25.132 --> 25:28.309
Acknowledge that even you
have blind spots.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.618
Hear me when I say
that they need help

25:32.661 --> 25:36.796
and support me
in restoring some justice.

25:36.839 --> 25:39.320
-I am gonna fight this fight.
-You should.

25:39.363 --> 25:42.323
And you never should've
had to do this alone.

25:42.366 --> 25:43.803
None of this is okay.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.761
And I just feel so guilty.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.720
I appreciate that.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.897
But guilt is
an inactive emotion.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.681
It's about what you do next.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.772
It's about how
you change going forward.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.612
I thought
I was listening, J'onn.

26:10.656 --> 26:15.748
You know, our lives
and our experiences,

26:15.791 --> 26:19.447
Kelly and I, we have
so much in common. I just--

26:19.490 --> 26:24.191
You will most likely
never understand
what she's going through.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.109
I came to this planet
as a Martian.

26:30.937 --> 26:33.940
And in my heart,
I've always been
more Martian than anything.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.813
But...

26:37.857 --> 26:42.339
I have chosen to wear
the face of a Black man
for a very long time now.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.124
I could've changed races,

26:44.167 --> 26:46.648
could've changed
into someone else entirely.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.740
But if I'm honest...

26:51.784 --> 26:55.483
wearing this skin
has made me feel most
like an alien on this planet.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.009
Feeling like I don't belong.

27:00.053 --> 27:03.143
Never quite getting comfortable
with the idea that this...

27:05.493 --> 27:07.147
really is my home.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.456
But I also realize
that Kelly and James

27:12.500 --> 27:14.633
don't have the option
to make that choice.

27:20.334 --> 27:23.206
I know you,
and I know your heart.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.600
And I know how much you
and Kelly love each other.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.168
She does, too.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.651
When she's ready to open up,
you'll be there for her.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.610
And she'll be glad
that you are.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.488
I analyzed Rankin's DNA,
thanks to the sample Kelly got,

27:44.532 --> 27:46.839
and I think I figured out
what's happening.

27:46.882 --> 27:50.103
It appears she was given
some kind of gene therapy

27:50.146 --> 27:52.671
that interacted
with the 5th dimensional energy

27:52.714 --> 27:56.065
and turned her
into a kind of energy siphon,

27:56.109 --> 27:58.198
pulling the very life-force
out of the people
in the Heights

27:58.241 --> 27:59.982
to make herself stronger.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.115
But I was in the Heights, too.
Why isn't it affecting me?

28:02.158 --> 28:04.204
It only affected the people
who were initially
in the blast zone.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.467
So how do we stop her?

28:06.510 --> 28:09.600
The power-dampening tech
we used on Nyxly can create
our own energy siphon

28:09.644 --> 28:11.907
that will pull
the 5th dimensional
energy from Rankin

28:11.951 --> 28:14.388
and the debris
and return it to the people.

28:14.431 --> 28:17.696
It won't heal all their wounds,
but it will give them their
energy back.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.393
This process will consume

28:19.436 --> 28:21.482
all the 5th dimensional energy
in the debris.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.310
We won't be able to use it
to track Mxy.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.442
The people in the Heights
are the priority right now.

28:25.486 --> 28:28.141
And we'll make sure to lure
Rankin out of the Heights

28:28.184 --> 28:29.229
when we take her down.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.752
Agreed. But not too far.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.798
We need to stay close
to the affected people

28:32.841 --> 28:36.018
in order to properly
redirect the energy back
to where it belongs.

28:36.062 --> 28:39.326
With just a slight modification
for Rankin's specific
energy signature,

28:39.369 --> 28:41.023
our scanners
will lead us right to her.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.244
It's okay.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.767
If it means
getting them healthy...

28:48.465 --> 28:49.902
let's go get her.

28:49.945 --> 28:52.034
Okay. All right,
I'll let the team know.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.470
Do you need a ride
to the Heights?

28:53.514 --> 28:54.863

of something first.

I need your help with that.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.961
The helmet needs some work.

29:06.005 --> 29:09.312
The sight-lines aren't great,
and more importantly,

29:09.356 --> 29:12.838
I have some
other visibility ideas.

29:12.881 --> 29:16.058
I have been waiting
for this moment
a very long time.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.807
Wow.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.417
I've been working on yours
for quite a while.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.987
I have a few 31st century ideas
I think you'll like.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.295
Brainy, I have a question.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.384
-Fire away.
-In the 31st century...

29:40.517 --> 29:41.692
are we any better?

29:43.346 --> 29:45.000
Have we figured out
any of this?

29:45.044 --> 29:47.481
Ending discrimination, racism?

29:47.524 --> 29:49.483
Please tell me we do.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.920
I want to tell you
it's all in the past

29:51.964 --> 29:54.967
and that we have
evolved past it all.

29:57.534 --> 30:00.407
Even in the 31st century,
we haven't.

30:02.104 --> 30:05.673
It is better in so many ways,

30:05.716 --> 30:08.545
but there are
generational scars.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.027
And honestly,
a lot of work still to be done.

30:14.421 --> 30:17.816

have here, in this time,
that we never had?

30:17.859 --> 30:18.686

You're not gonna
hurt this city anymore.

31:26.754 --> 31:29.757

I can transform this city,

and the weak
and make it perfect.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.632
And no one will stop me.

31:35.676 --> 31:39.245
I'm going to destroy
this whole city and rebuild it
from the ground up.

their energy.

just gonna go and leave us
with a mess to clean up.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.260
-Why should I trust you?
-You shouldn't.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.264
Trust should be earned.

32:42.308 --> 32:46.355
And when you've been wronged,
nothing in you tells you
to trust again.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.185
I'm just asking for a chance.

for people to recover,
but they will.

And remember, always eat

-What? It's true.
-Thank you.

is being served.

That was a helluva debut.

James would be so proud
to see you like this,
working with the community.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.862

"Don't be a hero to the people.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.173
Be a hero for the people."

I'm sorry.

I thought I understood
something that is so much
larger than I grasped.

35:52.933 --> 35:58.373
While there are more injustices
than I can count,

35:58.417 --> 36:02.421
