01:52.813 --> 01:53.946
Really Brenda?

01:53.948 --> 01:55.080
Now is not the time.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.248
Is it ever?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.550
They're in there
waiting for my announcement.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.550
In an hour and a half.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.853
You wanna tell me why, Frank?

02:00.855 --> 02:04.290
It's strictly business,
I'm sure you understand.

02:04.292 --> 02:08.259
You wanna look me in the
eye and tell me the truth?

02:08.262 --> 02:10.963
Unofficially?

02:10.965 --> 02:12.163
Anderson's bringing
in a bunch of his

02:12.165 --> 02:13.834
super loyal yes men.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.235
You look great, by the way.

02:18.237 --> 02:19.404
When you hired me,

02:19.406 --> 02:23.574
you told me you needed people
who're allowed to think.

02:23.576 --> 02:24.775
Yeah, well, that's
the difference

02:24.777 --> 02:26.977
between me and
Anderson, isn't it?

02:32.884 --> 02:34.584
Get ready.

02:34.586 --> 02:36.988
Your old friend Walter Smith.

02:38.122 --> 02:39.923
Who's Walter Smith?

02:39.925 --> 02:41.292
He was my first
arrest at the NSA,

02:41.294 --> 02:42.326
what does he mean, get ready?

02:42.328 --> 02:46.265
He's in prison.

02:49.033 --> 02:52.036
Frank, a Walter
Smith has escaped.

02:54.907 --> 02:57.173
I'll track his phone.

02:57.175 --> 02:59.042
No, that won't do any
good, he's an IT wizard.

02:59.044 --> 03:00.743
You've heard of him,
he's Walter Smith.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.143
He's the only guy who
was ever convicted

03:02.145 --> 03:04.114
of helping Edward Snowden.

03:12.022 --> 03:14.690
He sent me a link, do
you have a computer?

03:14.692 --> 03:16.659
Yeah.

03:27.837 --> 03:29.237
Oh my god.

03:31.807 --> 03:33.340
That's Elizabeth.

03:33.342 --> 03:35.110
That's my daughter.

03:41.151 --> 03:42.116
How can you tell?

03:42.118 --> 03:43.817
You can hardly see her face.

03:43.819 --> 03:47.755
That's the bonnet Sarah's
mother bought for her.

03:47.757 --> 03:49.722
Call the police.

03:49.724 --> 03:52.292
No, no, we'll keep it NSA.

03:52.294 --> 03:54.797
I'm gonna call the babysitter.

03:57.967 --> 04:00.434
Hi, I have Deputy General
Frank Kovacick for you.

04:00.436 --> 04:02.036
- Pick up the phone.
- We need assistance.

04:02.038 --> 04:03.770
Just pick up the phone.

04:03.772 --> 04:06.138
I have operator Zoe Messina.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.340
- Uh, yeah, Zoe, um.
- Yes sir.

04:08.342 --> 04:10.209
Listen, we just
received a threat

04:10.211 --> 04:11.345
that my daughter might
have been kidnapped.

04:11.347 --> 04:12.780
I need you to send somebody

04:12.782 --> 04:15.447
over to her babysitter's
address right now.

04:15.449 --> 04:19.051
- Excuse me?
- It's 22 Emory Road.

04:19.053 --> 04:21.120
That's
close, but, but why?

04:21.122 --> 04:22.721
Alright, sit tight.

04:22.723 --> 04:24.255
I'll send someone
over immediately.

04:24.257 --> 04:26.224
Send every man and woman
you got, you hear me?

04:26.226 --> 04:27.926
I, I'm not sure
I can do that, sir.

04:27.928 --> 04:30.228
I'm ordering you to.

04:30.230 --> 04:32.063
Will do, sir.

04:32.065 --> 04:34.365
Son of a bitch.

04:34.367 --> 04:35.933
That son of a bitch.

04:35.935 --> 04:38.135
This time I'll
break all his bones.

04:38.137 --> 04:40.404
Shouldn't you call Sarah?

04:40.406 --> 04:44.710
Just wait until we know
what we're dealig with.

04:46.146 --> 04:47.648
It's another link.

04:59.158 --> 05:01.694
He's calling you.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.029
Are you ready to be

05:06.031 --> 05:07.932
the new Edward Snowden?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.769
Let my daughter go.

05:12.771 --> 05:13.771
Angry?

05:13.773 --> 05:14.971
Already?

05:14.973 --> 05:16.841
I wonder how you'll
be in a hour.

05:17.874 --> 05:19.377
Please, my baby is innocent.

05:20.911 --> 05:23.779
My baby
was innocent too.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.782
But are you?

05:26.050 --> 05:29.385
Listen, the dog, you can't...

05:29.387 --> 05:31.387
That dog
doesn't spy on people,

05:31.389 --> 05:33.123
it doesn't read their mails.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.824
It doesn't tap their phones,
it doesn't invade their homes.

05:36.826 --> 05:38.961
What do you want?

05:38.963 --> 05:42.264
Total
obedience to begin with.

05:42.266 --> 05:44.933
Isn't that what you ask
of all your loyal people?

05:44.935 --> 05:46.336
What do you want?

05:47.538 --> 05:49.805
I'm not joking.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.473
There is a cell phone
hidden in that kennel.

05:52.475 --> 05:54.474
That dog will
attack your daughter

05:54.476 --> 05:58.147
when it hears the ringtone
followed by my voice.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.983
All I have to do
is link the call.

06:03.086 --> 06:05.385
You psychopath.

06:05.387 --> 06:09.022
Did you just call
me psychopath, Mr. Kovacich?

06:09.024 --> 06:11.492
That's not a good start.

06:11.494 --> 06:13.127
Shall I make that phone call?

06:13.129 --> 06:14.861
No!

06:14.863 --> 06:17.132
Just tell me what you want.

06:19.067 --> 06:22.502
You gathered a
lot of information illegally.

06:22.504 --> 06:24.904
I have never done
anything illegal.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.339
Whatever you think
of the Patriot Act,

06:26.341 --> 06:29.043
I acted within the
boundaries of my authority.

06:29.045 --> 06:32.144
You spy on
anybody you like to spy on.

06:32.146 --> 06:34.415
Absolutely not, prove it.

06:41.555 --> 06:45.392
Mr. Kovacich, that's
exactly what I intend to do.

06:45.394 --> 06:47.327
You're gonna send all files

06:47.329 --> 06:49.262
that were obtained
with a dragnet,

06:49.264 --> 06:50.995
that is everything without

06:50.997 --> 06:53.901
an official warrant
designating it.

06:56.237 --> 06:58.437
What are you talking about?

06:58.439 --> 07:02.810
All of the files
you call SSD Division One.

07:04.579 --> 07:06.512
No such thing exists.

07:06.514 --> 07:08.880
No, it does.

07:08.882 --> 07:12.851
I want the entire thing
uploaded right now.

07:12.853 --> 07:14.118
You want me to call the dog?

07:14.120 --> 07:15.923
Okay, okay, look.

07:18.425 --> 07:21.091
If the network did exist,
it would be so much data,

07:21.093 --> 07:24.262
it would make Edward Snowden
look like a petty thief.

07:24.264 --> 07:26.096
And that's
why I've designed

07:26.098 --> 07:28.632
a program especially for you.

07:28.634 --> 07:30.335
Wait for my email.

07:32.973 --> 07:33.807
Fuck.

07:35.608 --> 07:37.974
Send me the program.

07:37.976 --> 07:39.909
One more thing.

07:39.911 --> 07:44.647
Stay exactly where you are
right now, Mr. Kovacich,

07:44.649 --> 07:47.183
or I will call your daughter.

07:51.290 --> 07:53.257
What do you want me to do?

07:53.259 --> 07:55.994
Stay, please,
I need your help.

07:57.595 --> 08:00.264
Well, we obviously
can't send him anything.

08:00.266 --> 08:02.899
It's my daughter, Brenda.

08:02.901 --> 08:04.199
It's also
potentially the lives

08:04.201 --> 08:07.036
of thousands of
innocent operatives,

08:07.038 --> 08:09.204
not to mention that
the privacy of...

08:12.541 --> 08:16.212
me, and everybody who's
ever worked for the NSA.

08:28.358 --> 08:30.091
Zoe.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.692
We're at
the address, Frank,

08:31.694 --> 08:34.929
but there's no trace of the
babysitter or your daughter.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.363
Have you looked everywhere?

08:36.365 --> 08:38.332
We could check
the neighborhood.

08:38.335 --> 08:40.299
Yes, check everywhere, look
all over the neighborhood.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.135
Look at the houses, the
basements, the yards,

08:42.138 --> 08:43.169
whatever you have to do.

08:43.172 --> 08:45.339
She's in a kennel with a dog.

08:45.341 --> 08:46.440
A dog kennel?

08:46.442 --> 08:47.975
Zoe, this is officer Hoffman,

08:47.977 --> 08:49.609
we need a background check
on anybody associated

08:49.611 --> 08:52.445
with a Walter Alexander Smith,

08:52.447 --> 08:54.415
a fugitive from Clinton
Correctional Facility.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.182
Yeah, and check any
known sympathizers

08:56.184 --> 08:58.417
with Edward Snowden and
the pro-privacy movement.

08:58.419 --> 09:00.185
Listen, I'm gonna
send you a list

09:00.187 --> 09:01.722
of every single person in
the entire state of Virginia

09:01.724 --> 09:03.324
who's ever typed the
words Edward Snowden

09:03.326 --> 09:05.592
into a search
engine, you got it?

09:05.594 --> 09:06.560
Copy that.

09:06.562 --> 09:08.994
We'll find her, Frank.

09:08.996 --> 09:10.430
Frank.

09:10.432 --> 09:11.597
Brenda.

09:11.599 --> 09:12.998
We need to be careful
how we act here,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.400
if you get caught,
that is your job...

09:14.402 --> 09:17.939
Yes, but I will
still have a daughter.

09:20.642 --> 09:21.475
Excuse me.

09:25.278 --> 09:27.411
What are you doing?

09:27.413 --> 09:30.315
I'm downloading his program.

09:30.317 --> 09:33.486
Let me see
the email addresses.

09:37.624 --> 09:40.324
How does it feel?

09:40.326 --> 09:42.094
What?

09:42.096 --> 09:44.060
You're going to be
a million times more famous

09:44.062 --> 09:46.030
than Edward Snowden.

09:46.032 --> 09:48.432
Everybody in the entire
world will know who you are.

09:48.434 --> 09:50.102
Your email is Russian.

09:50.104 --> 09:51.770
The
enemies of our enemies

09:51.772 --> 09:54.738
are our friends, Mr. Kovacich.

09:54.740 --> 09:57.374
Who are you working for?

09:57.376 --> 09:58.776
Ah, is that Sarah?

09:58.778 --> 10:00.544
How are you?

10:00.546 --> 10:03.214
Why are you doing this?

10:03.216 --> 10:05.348
I'll
ask the questions.

10:05.350 --> 10:08.018
Now start downloading.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.193
Frank.

10:18.398 --> 10:19.432
Frank.

10:23.368 --> 10:26.368
Frank, I can't stand here
and watch you do this.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.738
If you send those files, you
may kill innocent families.

10:28.740 --> 10:29.704
We don't know that for sure.

10:29.706 --> 10:31.806
We don't understand
the risk, that's enough.

10:31.808 --> 10:33.609
She'll be eaten alive, Bren.

10:33.611 --> 10:36.179
It's my daughter, Bren.

10:36.181 --> 10:37.579
What would you do?

10:37.581 --> 10:40.382
If that was your daughter,
what would you do, huh?

10:40.384 --> 10:41.217
Help me.

10:44.455 --> 10:47.455
Alright, then you may need
to go ahead and fire me.

10:47.457 --> 10:49.757
Because as NSA, I can't
knowingly participate in this.

10:49.759 --> 10:51.627
No, no, no, no,
no, no, listen to me.

10:51.629 --> 10:52.828
You have to trust me,

10:52.830 --> 10:55.097
I promise you that whatever
happens, I will protect you.

10:55.099 --> 10:56.831
How could
you possibly say that?

10:56.833 --> 10:59.333
Because I've done it before.

10:59.335 --> 11:00.501
What?

11:00.503 --> 11:02.270
In what cases, when?

11:02.272 --> 11:04.340
Look, just, thank you.

11:06.241 --> 11:07.507
Okay?

11:07.509 --> 11:10.177
Thank you for everything,
and don't worry.

11:10.179 --> 11:12.446
I am worried, and
you should be too.

11:12.448 --> 11:14.482
You can't possibly
send him any of the...

11:14.484 --> 11:16.083
No, no, no, I'm
never gonna do that.

11:16.085 --> 11:17.818
Listen, I'm not gonna
send anything classified,

11:17.820 --> 11:19.353
there's gonna be so much
information in those files,

11:19.355 --> 11:21.356
he's never gonna notice.

11:26.427 --> 11:27.261
Okay.

11:32.134 --> 11:34.434
It still doesn't feel right.

11:34.436 --> 11:37.372
Well, killing a
baby isn't right.

11:38.673 --> 11:40.206
Besides, Anderson will
immediately send out a team

11:40.208 --> 11:41.842
to arrest me when I
begin the download.

11:41.844 --> 11:45.544
They'll swarm in
here in no time.

11:45.546 --> 11:47.445
It's a class A safety procedure.

11:47.447 --> 11:48.747
As soon as the
network is accessed,

11:48.749 --> 11:50.684
an alert goes straight
to Anderson's office.

11:50.686 --> 11:52.450
He'll see it and I'll
be taken into custody.

11:52.452 --> 11:54.353
There'll be nothing
Walter can blame me for.

11:54.355 --> 11:56.155
We will have followed
his direction perfectly,

11:56.157 --> 11:58.492
and the data will be secure.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.095
Okay, this is it.

12:02.696 --> 12:03.696
Now we wait.

12:08.402 --> 12:09.868
It doesn't feel right.

12:09.870 --> 12:12.536
Yeah, well, get used to it.

12:12.538 --> 12:16.174
What is that supposed to mean?

12:16.176 --> 12:17.407
It's real easy to stand
on the side of the river

12:17.409 --> 12:19.710
and criticize things
as they go by.

12:19.712 --> 12:22.213
It takes courage to jump
in the water and get wet.

12:22.215 --> 12:23.680
We did a lot of
simulations, Frank.

12:23.682 --> 12:25.282
Yeah, those are all
theoretical simulations,

12:25.284 --> 12:27.919
Those aren't real
life and death tests.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.353
You ever seen real
action, Brenda huh?

12:30.355 --> 12:35.225
You ever had to make a
life and death decision?

12:39.465 --> 12:41.100
Frank.

12:48.873 --> 12:50.473
Mr. Kovacich,

12:50.475 --> 12:53.743
you must really
take me for a moron.

12:53.745 --> 12:55.146
All this rubbish?

12:56.480 --> 12:59.648
That's all I got access to.

12:59.650 --> 13:00.782
Very well.

13:00.784 --> 13:02.884
Where's my daughter?

13:02.886 --> 13:05.588
You want to know
if your daughter is safe?

13:05.590 --> 13:06.855
Yes!

13:06.857 --> 13:08.590
Okay, I'll call her.

13:08.592 --> 13:09.925
No!

13:09.927 --> 13:13.195
Okay, look, I'll
send you more files.

13:13.197 --> 13:15.664
Not more files, Mr. Kovacich.

13:15.666 --> 13:16.666
Every file.

13:17.634 --> 13:19.434
And don't try to be smart again.

13:19.436 --> 13:22.772
I know exactly which
files you have access to.

13:22.774 --> 13:24.605
If there's anything missing,

13:24.607 --> 13:27.710
that dog will have
a nice sweet meal.

13:29.745 --> 13:31.546
Why is he doing this, Frank?

13:31.548 --> 13:33.546
What, making the
second man in the NSA

13:33.548 --> 13:35.918
the new Edward Snowden, really?

13:37.687 --> 13:40.454
He knows so much about you.

13:40.456 --> 13:41.922
Is it personal?

13:41.924 --> 13:44.224
Could it be some kind of prank?

13:44.226 --> 13:45.758
I'm not taking any chances.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.362
Not with Elizabeth.

13:48.864 --> 13:50.330
Just don't worry, Bren.

13:50.332 --> 13:51.397
I'll never get to
send a lot of files

13:51.399 --> 13:53.233
before Anderson
blocks my access.

13:56.304 --> 13:56.938
Shit.

13:58.374 --> 13:59.007
What?

13:59.975 --> 14:02.342
Incorrect password.

14:02.344 --> 14:03.675
Well, that's a
good sign, right?

14:03.677 --> 14:04.877
That means Anderson's
blocking your access.

14:04.879 --> 14:07.882
Yeah, but who
changed the password?

14:09.650 --> 14:12.719
Frank, are those
your passwords?

14:12.721 --> 14:15.688
Do you keep your passwords
in a card in your wallet?

14:15.690 --> 14:17.492
Come on, come on.

14:18.792 --> 14:19.625
Look.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.562
Give me accepted.

14:24.265 --> 14:24.899
Yes.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.401
Jesus, this guy's good.

14:29.403 --> 14:32.271
Look at how fast his
program downloads.

14:32.273 --> 14:33.472
And even at that speed,

14:33.474 --> 14:35.440
it's still gonna take 147
hours to complete the upload.

14:35.442 --> 14:39.413
There's no way Anderson
won't be here by then.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.647
Do you
think he had help?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.915
Of course he had help.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.383
There's no way the guy
could escape that place.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.853
No, I mean help
from inside the NSA.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.055
Another Edward
Snowden inside the NSA?

14:51.057 --> 14:53.858
There's no way, you know
our security since Snowden.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.828
- Yeah?
- Zoe.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.299
A police officer just
found a baby in a dog cage

15:01.301 --> 15:02.967
outside of a house in Richmond.

15:02.969 --> 15:07.738
It belongs to a Daniel Smith,
Walter Smith's second cousin.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.041
Where's my daughter?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.742
I think I see your
daughter, Frank.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.910
She's in the dog kennel.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.045
Shoot the dog,
that's an order!

15:15.047 --> 15:16.512
Frank.

15:16.514 --> 15:17.946
We're setting
up the shot now, Frank.

15:17.948 --> 15:19.250
Be careful.

15:23.922 --> 15:26.890
Zoe, what the hell was that?

15:26.892 --> 15:28.525
Zoe!

15:28.527 --> 15:29.825
I don't know.

15:29.827 --> 15:31.393
What happened?

15:31.395 --> 15:33.695
Something exploded,
there's fire everywhere.

15:33.697 --> 15:35.531
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

15:48.511 --> 15:50.346
I'm so sorry, Frank.

15:51.715 --> 15:52.815
I'm so sorry.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.661
I knew you would
find my cousin's house,

16:06.663 --> 16:08.595
who by the way just rented it

16:08.597 --> 16:11.300
to a young couple with a baby.

16:12.369 --> 16:15.502
Did you barge in again
with too many men?

16:15.504 --> 16:16.938
I guess a police bullet

16:16.940 --> 16:17.938
- must have hit the explosives.
- You son of a bitch.

16:17.940 --> 16:20.607
You killed my baby.

16:20.609 --> 16:25.646
She's still
alive, but not thanks to you.

16:25.648 --> 16:28.047
As you can see, I am much better

16:28.049 --> 16:30.016
at this game than you are.

16:30.018 --> 16:33.388
Do you really want
to test me further?

16:40.129 --> 16:43.463
My access to the files
still isn't blocked.

16:43.465 --> 16:45.533
What's keeping them so long?

16:46.833 --> 16:49.336
You think we're being watched?

16:51.905 --> 16:53.406
I don't know.

16:53.408 --> 16:55.608
They're way too organized.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.075
Who's they?

16:57.077 --> 16:58.477
Walter Smith and
whoever he's working for.

16:58.479 --> 17:00.445
He had to have some inside help.

17:00.447 --> 17:01.414
Maybe somebody unhappy

17:01.416 --> 17:04.114
with your upcoming announcement?

17:04.116 --> 17:06.050
I'm calling Anderson.

17:07.118 --> 17:08.553
Stella, hi.

17:08.555 --> 17:11.057
It's Frank Kovacich,
is Anderson in?

17:12.692 --> 17:13.527
What?

17:16.896 --> 17:18.061
He called in sick today.

17:18.064 --> 17:19.730
So?

17:19.732 --> 17:20.765
I've known the
guy for 15 years,

17:20.767 --> 17:21.965
he's never called in sick.

17:21.968 --> 17:23.099
Today of all days?

17:23.102 --> 17:26.470
I don't know,
Frank, coincidences can happen.

17:26.472 --> 17:27.471
Not like this,
they don't happen.

17:27.473 --> 17:28.672
Walter Smith escapes.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.441
They haven't blocked
my access yet.

17:30.443 --> 17:34.444
Maybe it has something to
do with the reorganization.

17:34.446 --> 17:35.612
That's not it.

17:35.614 --> 17:36.448
Listen.

17:37.215 --> 17:38.949
I talked to my buddy,

17:38.951 --> 17:40.084
congressman Timothy
Miller, the other day,

17:40.086 --> 17:42.052
and he had mentioned something
about the possibility

17:42.054 --> 17:44.822
of Anderson being replaced
as the head of NSA

17:44.824 --> 17:47.759
for someone a little
more patriotic.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.561
Frank, what does that mean?

17:51.563 --> 17:53.164
More patriotic, Frank?

17:54.665 --> 17:56.099
Tim?

17:56.101 --> 17:58.067
Hey, bud, it's Kovacich.

17:58.069 --> 18:01.203
Yeah, I need you to
give me a call back.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.905
Something is
definitely not right.

18:03.907 --> 18:08.142
Frank, I think we need
to stop sending the files.

18:08.144 --> 18:09.110
Zoe.

18:09.112 --> 18:10.245
Yes sir.

18:10.247 --> 18:13.482
Have you found
my daughter yet?

18:13.484 --> 18:14.616
No, but
we have confirmed

18:14.618 --> 18:16.786
that there was no
baby in the fire.

18:16.788 --> 18:18.687
We've got every man
in Arlington county

18:18.689 --> 18:19.787
on the job.

18:19.789 --> 18:21.722
We'll find her, Frank.

18:21.724 --> 18:23.759
Frank, another link.

18:30.733 --> 18:31.567
Frank.

18:38.673 --> 18:43.511
The NSA plays the
people, right Mr. Kovacich?

18:43.513 --> 18:46.980
You wanna beat the
NSA, Walter, good luck.

18:46.982 --> 18:48.748
Well, now
it's time for the people

18:48.750 --> 18:50.019
to play the NSA.

18:51.653 --> 18:55.654
Do you know where Edward
Snowden went wrong?

18:55.656 --> 18:59.159
He failed to share his information
in an attractive way.

18:59.161 --> 19:02.263
He didn't have a
brilliant marketing plan.

19:02.265 --> 19:04.697
What are you talking about?

19:04.699 --> 19:06.966
I have a
little camera here,

19:06.968 --> 19:08.634
so you can follow me,

19:08.636 --> 19:10.303
and see what I do.

19:10.305 --> 19:12.872
Exciting, isn't it?

19:12.874 --> 19:14.007
Where am I?

19:14.009 --> 19:17.075
Yeah, where are you?

19:17.077 --> 19:19.011
Tick, tick, tick.

19:19.013 --> 19:20.846
Remember, that dog gets more

19:20.848 --> 19:23.114
and more hungry each minute.

19:23.116 --> 19:24.917
Don't let him get so hungry

19:24.919 --> 19:27.653
that I can't
control him anymore.

19:28.690 --> 19:30.922
Where is he going?

19:30.924 --> 19:32.623
What is his game?

19:32.625 --> 19:33.824
I don't know.

19:33.826 --> 19:35.826
Well, you
must know something.

19:35.828 --> 19:36.797
He picked you.

19:38.298 --> 19:41.065
I was one of two dozen
people who took him down.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.767
I have no idea.

19:42.769 --> 19:44.201
I mean, is it some
kind of revenge?

19:44.203 --> 19:46.604
Does he blame you
personally for something?

19:46.606 --> 19:47.240
Me?

19:48.875 --> 19:49.709
No.

19:55.682 --> 19:56.948
What's that box?

19:56.950 --> 19:58.248
Has that package
always been here?

19:58.250 --> 20:00.351
I don't know,
I'll get it Frank.

20:00.353 --> 20:02.788
It must have passed security.

20:09.294 --> 20:11.928
Frank, think of why
this is happening.

20:11.930 --> 20:13.932
There must be something.

20:46.763 --> 20:48.965
Proceed, Mr. Smith.

20:57.007 --> 21:01.142
You raided my house like
I was Osama Bin Laden.

21:01.144 --> 21:02.744
You attacked my wife.

21:02.746 --> 21:04.277
The Lomax garage.

21:04.279 --> 21:05.478
What did you do to my wife?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.748
Do you admit that
you were at the Lomax garage

21:07.750 --> 21:09.651
last year, September 17th?

21:09.653 --> 21:12.084
I don't remember the date.

21:12.086 --> 21:14.421
They fixed my car.

21:14.423 --> 21:17.792
I work in the area, at a
subway station, I'm an en...

21:21.864 --> 21:23.363
Alright, well, if you
have nothing to hide,

21:23.365 --> 21:25.132
then you also admit that
you were at a Starbucks,

21:25.134 --> 21:28.200
November the 4th, 7:12 AM?

21:28.202 --> 21:31.938
I buy a double espresso
there at 7:00 a.m.,

21:31.940 --> 21:34.341
every single morning,
from January to December.

21:34.343 --> 21:35.177
Why?

21:36.377 --> 21:38.444
I ask the questions
here Mr. Smith.

21:38.446 --> 21:39.311
On December...

21:44.818 --> 21:45.751
I live there.

21:45.753 --> 21:47.254
I walk there.

21:47.256 --> 21:50.355
I jog there, like
everybody else there, why?

21:50.357 --> 21:54.226
Well, I don't believe in
coincidences, Mr. Smith.

21:54.228 --> 21:55.728
On every single of
these security tapes

21:55.730 --> 21:57.796
we also have your friend.

21:57.798 --> 21:58.997
Who?

21:58.999 --> 22:01.167
Edward Snowden.

22:01.169 --> 22:06.171
Look, I do
not know Edward Snowden!

22:06.173 --> 22:07.104
It was something
for maintenance,

22:07.106 --> 22:09.841
they're gonna come get it soon.

22:09.843 --> 22:11.342
Listen, Brenda.

22:11.344 --> 22:16.213
Listen, could you do me a
favor and get me a coffee?

22:16.215 --> 22:17.783
I can't leave here.

22:19.051 --> 22:20.719
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

22:31.364 --> 22:35.735
Look, in how many different
ways do I have to tell you

22:37.236 --> 22:41.004
that I have never
ever had any contact

22:41.006 --> 22:45.107
with Edward Snowden
in any way possible.

22:45.109 --> 22:46.844
This is a joke, right?

22:46.846 --> 22:49.179
This is not
a joke, Mr. Smith.

22:49.181 --> 22:50.783
You're insane!

22:52.117 --> 22:54.118
Where is your warrant?

22:55.987 --> 22:58.153
Do you have all the
security footage,

22:58.155 --> 23:00.758
and you draw insane conclusions.

23:04.394 --> 23:08.363
You can't even see who I'm talking
to on most of this stuff,

23:08.365 --> 23:09.200
but,

23:10.434 --> 23:13.104
look, I don't know
Edward Snowden!

23:14.938 --> 23:18.141
But you do admit that you
sympathize with him, right?

23:18.143 --> 23:21.308
Just because you
hack security cameras

23:21.310 --> 23:23.511
on which we see Edward Snowden,

23:23.513 --> 23:25.313
it doesn't mean that everybody

23:25.315 --> 23:29.984
in the recording of the
next 24 hours is guilty!

23:29.986 --> 23:32.988
He got his car fixed
at Lomax garage!

23:32.990 --> 23:37.160
He shows up months later,
at a Starbucks, big deal!

23:46.368 --> 23:48.302
What did you do to my wife?

23:48.304 --> 23:50.406
She'll be fine.

23:52.575 --> 23:54.941
What did you do to my wife?

23:54.943 --> 23:56.809
She'll be fine.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.878
Where is she?

23:58.880 --> 24:00.913
She'll be fine.

24:00.915 --> 24:03.183
What did you do to my wife?

24:10.291 --> 24:11.326
Frank.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.230
Let's find another room.

24:28.942 --> 24:30.176
Looks reserved.

24:40.287 --> 24:42.355
Taxi, he's in New York.

24:47.926 --> 24:50.261
Zoe, the bastard's
in New York City.

24:50.263 --> 24:51.562
He must have left Elizabeth

24:51.564 --> 24:53.264
somewhere between Fort
Meade and New York.

24:53.266 --> 24:55.132
Listen, I'm gonna
send you something

24:55.134 --> 24:56.867
on every single Snowden sympathizer
in the tri-state area.

24:56.869 --> 24:57.803
You got it?

24:59.305 --> 25:01.203
I'll need way
more help then, Frank.

25:01.205 --> 25:03.440
I mean, that spans
hundreds of counties.

25:03.442 --> 25:04.642
Yeah, you'll get it.

25:04.644 --> 25:05.942
Listen, the NSA's gonna be
calling you in a few minutes.

25:05.944 --> 25:07.612
You hang in there, okay?

25:07.614 --> 25:10.145
You'll get everything you need.

25:10.147 --> 25:11.315
Roger.

25:12.517 --> 25:14.017
Maybe they can recognize him

25:14.019 --> 25:16.151
by the camera on his shoe.

25:16.153 --> 25:18.390
No, he's too intelligent.

25:20.192 --> 25:22.625
Is that Murray Hill?

25:22.627 --> 25:26.196
No, I
lived in Murray Hill.

25:26.198 --> 25:27.865
I'll get the NYPD.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.532
Yeah.

25:30.534 --> 25:35.305
Listen, I want them ready as
soon as we know more, okay?

25:35.307 --> 25:39.574
Think, Frank, why is
Smith doing this to you?

25:39.576 --> 25:44.145
I have a feeling we'll
find out soon enough.

25:44.147 --> 25:47.081
He's going into
a subway station.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.382
Oh, that's great.

25:48.384 --> 25:50.119
Subway stations are loaded
with security cameras.

25:50.121 --> 25:53.023
We'll request access
to their feed.

25:54.659 --> 25:56.658
Hi, this is Brenda Hoffman, NSA.

25:56.660 --> 25:58.092
We need assistance
in a foot pursuit

25:58.094 --> 26:00.529
in what looks like Manhattan.

26:01.498 --> 26:02.966
Yes, I'll hold.

26:06.970 --> 26:08.169
Look, this is
probably bad timing,

26:08.171 --> 26:09.336
but can I ask you something?

26:09.338 --> 26:10.571
What?

26:10.573 --> 26:14.173
What's going on
with you and Anderson?

26:14.175 --> 26:15.441
Excuse me?

26:15.443 --> 26:17.611
Don't get mad at
me, I'm just asking.

26:17.613 --> 26:20.248
What's going on with you guys?

26:20.250 --> 26:21.649
Did you track my...

26:21.651 --> 26:23.717
No, I absolutely
did not spy on you

26:23.719 --> 26:25.251
or breach your privacy.

26:25.253 --> 26:27.019
I'm just, I know you
were in his office.

26:27.021 --> 26:28.322
How?

26:28.324 --> 26:30.056
Look, I get all
the security reports

26:30.058 --> 26:32.191
of the people going in and
out of the offices here.

26:32.193 --> 26:33.592
Look, I know who
goes in and out,

26:33.594 --> 26:35.227
and when and where, and just...

26:35.229 --> 26:37.363
Not in the bathrooms, I hope.

26:37.365 --> 26:38.731
No, I just.

26:38.733 --> 26:40.968
Look, I know you were in
his office in the evening.

26:40.970 --> 26:42.403
So what, Frank?

26:43.704 --> 26:45.136
If you don't want to tell me

26:45.138 --> 26:48.074
you were hacking
his computer, fine.

26:48.076 --> 26:48.910
Computer.

26:56.351 --> 26:59.985
Wait, look, look,
come here, come here.

26:59.987 --> 27:01.353
Flower shop.

27:01.355 --> 27:04.288
It's Lexington and Union Square.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.155
Are you sure?

27:05.157 --> 27:06.459
You have the NYPD yet?

27:06.461 --> 27:08.461
No, I'm still on hold.

27:13.599 --> 27:14.766
But it looks like

27:14.768 --> 27:19.068
the Metropolitan Subway System
is down, 20 minutes now.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.271
Jesus, he's good.

27:22.576 --> 27:24.375
Hi, Commissioner Cohen,

27:24.377 --> 27:28.112
I have Deputy General Frank
Kovacich, NSA, on the line.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.613
Can you hear me?

27:29.615 --> 27:30.780
Loud and clear.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.717
Listen, we have a
fugitive, Walter Smith.

27:33.719 --> 27:36.120
I already
sent the files.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.388
Yes, we're processing

27:37.390 --> 27:38.689
what we know about
Smith right now.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.224
Listen, this
Smith is at Union Square

27:40.226 --> 27:42.125
getting on a
northbound six train.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.227
He's extremely dangerous.

27:43.229 --> 27:46.328
We're dealing with
an NTSA code red.

27:46.330 --> 27:49.065
NTSA code red, why?

27:49.067 --> 27:50.232
Why?

27:50.234 --> 27:52.736
Because I just
ordered you to do so.

27:54.272 --> 27:56.605
NTSA code red,
can you confirm, please?

27:56.607 --> 27:58.341
NTSA
code red confirmed.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.276
When you get him, make sure
he doesn't make a phone call.

28:00.278 --> 28:02.144
It's a matter of life and death.

28:02.146 --> 28:03.546
Roger that, sir.

28:03.548 --> 28:06.448
NTSA code red means a
terrorist attack, Frank.

28:06.450 --> 28:08.051
So?

28:08.053 --> 28:11.689
So, we haven't even confirmed
if the threat is real.

28:14.191 --> 28:17.027
Frank, you can end
this right now.

28:18.628 --> 28:20.661
Think about your history.

28:20.663 --> 28:22.396
What do you know about him?

28:22.398 --> 28:24.400
Where could he be going?

28:26.336 --> 28:28.536
23 hours and 15 minutes?

28:28.538 --> 28:32.273
10 minutes ago, the
countdown was 147 hours.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.408
What is this?

28:41.084 --> 28:42.549
Listen, I'm sorry.

28:42.551 --> 28:44.218
For what?

28:44.220 --> 28:46.353
It was none of my
business, you and Anderson.

28:46.355 --> 28:48.622
Don't worry
about it, Frank.

28:48.624 --> 28:50.457
He wasn't even in his office.

28:52.094 --> 28:53.128
Yeah?

28:55.597 --> 28:57.700
Great, I'll just take it.

29:06.775 --> 29:08.475
He's on the platform.

29:08.477 --> 29:09.709
Check everyone one
of the platforms!

29:09.711 --> 29:12.146
He's waiting on a platform.

29:13.815 --> 29:15.515
This is Brenda Hoffman, NSA.

29:15.517 --> 29:17.748
I've an NTSA code
red in operation.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.318
We need all traffic on the
Lexington Avenue Subway Line

29:20.320 --> 29:22.386
shut down immediately.

29:22.388 --> 29:23.322
I understand the implications,

29:23.324 --> 29:26.593
but it is a direct order
from Frank Kovacich.

29:26.595 --> 29:28.626
And if one more train
takes off from the station,

29:28.628 --> 29:31.197
it will be your job, thank you.

29:37.670 --> 29:41.305
Thank you, did you
learn that at simulations?

29:41.307 --> 29:42.643
Let's get Cohen.

29:47.646 --> 29:49.913
Commissioner Cohen?

29:49.915 --> 29:51.517
I'm here.

29:52.684 --> 29:54.352
Listen, he's on a platform.

29:54.354 --> 29:58.288
He can't get away, the
next trains won't take off.

29:58.290 --> 30:01.825
Roger that, my men
are almost there.

30:01.827 --> 30:04.693
The
doors are opening.

30:04.695 --> 30:07.365
He really thinks he's leaving.

30:09.769 --> 30:11.568
But, I thought it was...

30:11.570 --> 30:15.740
The train won't take off,
Frank, it won't take off.

30:20.511 --> 30:21.812
What's going on?

30:27.885 --> 30:32.257
Damn it, he assured me that
the train wouldn't take off.

30:34.458 --> 30:35.757
This is Brenda Hoffman,

30:35.759 --> 30:39.495
I wanna know exactly
what happened on the 456?

30:39.497 --> 30:42.666
What is
this, what happened?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.500
Frank, my men
arrived at the platform.

30:45.502 --> 30:46.802
They're checking everyone.

30:46.804 --> 30:49.469
His train just took off.

30:49.471 --> 30:51.905
No, sir, no train took off.

30:51.907 --> 30:53.708
MTA confirms it.

30:53.710 --> 30:56.179
No train took off from 456.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.646
He's messing with my head!

30:59.648 --> 31:01.415
Frank, calm down, okay?

31:01.417 --> 31:04.451
It just must be the
wrong subway station.

31:04.453 --> 31:05.687
No.

31:05.689 --> 31:06.955
The flower shop at
the entry, I know it.

31:06.957 --> 31:10.591
No, he films it at
an angle in order to trick us.

31:10.593 --> 31:12.594
No, you can't fool me.

31:13.696 --> 31:14.929
Look.

31:14.931 --> 31:17.631
Two hours and 16
minutes to download.

31:17.633 --> 31:19.365
What's going on here?

31:19.367 --> 31:21.736
Frank, we're on the internet.

31:22.871 --> 31:24.403
What?

31:24.405 --> 31:26.407
10,000 views already.

31:27.710 --> 31:30.544
The Lexington
Avenue Police sweep.

31:30.546 --> 31:31.777
There's a post
and a video titled

31:31.779 --> 31:34.914
NYPD Ridiculed by
Civil Rights Activists.

31:34.916 --> 31:38.351
Dirty secrets about
the NSA to come.

31:41.356 --> 31:45.527
NSA top guy fooled, more
NSA foolishness to come.

31:46.728 --> 31:49.327
This is his marketing plan.

31:49.329 --> 31:50.630
He's gonna have a lot of
people look at the video

31:50.632 --> 31:52.698
and then reveal our secrets.

31:52.700 --> 31:56.602
Oh my god, it's going
fast, almost 15,000 views.

31:56.604 --> 31:57.870
Yeah, Edward
Snowden had the data,

31:57.872 --> 31:58.871
but he couldn't
get everything out,

31:58.873 --> 32:00.873
because he didn't have a plan.

32:00.875 --> 32:04.308
Guys, we think we
may have a trace on his phone.

32:04.310 --> 32:06.277
No, no, uh-uh.

32:06.279 --> 32:08.580
If he left a trace, it's
because he wants to distract us,

32:08.582 --> 32:12.017
win time, or confuse us
from what he really wants.

32:12.019 --> 32:14.385
Oh my god, Frank.

32:25.664 --> 32:28.400
- Call Smith!
- We can't, Frank.

32:28.402 --> 32:30.569
You gotta calm down, okay?

32:31.636 --> 32:33.370
I know it's personal

32:33.372 --> 32:36.340
but that's all the more
reason to stay professional.

32:36.342 --> 32:37.509
Think, Frank.

32:38.576 --> 32:41.044
Why is he doing this to you?

32:48.086 --> 32:50.486
Alright, alright.

32:50.488 --> 32:52.587
Smith's on a moving train.

32:52.589 --> 32:54.524
We gotta stop
every moving train.

32:54.526 --> 32:56.726
Frank, in New York,
are you kidding me?

32:56.728 --> 32:57.794
No, I'm not kidding.

32:57.796 --> 32:59.461
Not about my daughter, I'm not.

32:59.463 --> 33:00.997
Frank, even if we
were able to do that,

33:00.999 --> 33:02.532
by the time it was done,

33:02.534 --> 33:04.600
he would be out on
the streets again.

33:04.602 --> 33:07.068
Calm down, Frank, think.

33:07.070 --> 33:07.703
Look.

33:10.641 --> 33:12.908
Where are you, you psychopath?

33:12.910 --> 33:14.511
What are you doing?

33:15.713 --> 33:17.345
What are you really doing?

33:40.068 --> 33:43.403
Are you looking
for something, Frank?

33:43.405 --> 33:44.271
Absolutely not.

33:44.273 --> 33:46.539
I heard a noise
coming from inside.

33:46.541 --> 33:47.475
A noise?

33:48.911 --> 33:52.480
It was music coming
from my personal phone.

33:55.584 --> 33:56.982
I'm sorry.

33:56.984 --> 33:58.418
The job makes me paranoid.

33:58.420 --> 33:59.652
No, it's fine.

33:59.654 --> 34:00.853
Paranoia comes
with the territory.

34:00.855 --> 34:05.158
Check everything before you
draw any conclusions, right?

34:05.160 --> 34:06.959
Excuse me, sirs?

34:06.961 --> 34:08.128
We traced his cell phone.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.563
We know where Smith is at
right now, he's in Brooklyn.

34:11.565 --> 34:12.632
No, can't be.

34:14.536 --> 34:17.503
Well, he is, at the
Fulton Street Subway Station.

34:17.505 --> 34:19.005
I've sent a lot
of men over there,

34:19.007 --> 34:22.074
they're closing in on him.

34:22.076 --> 34:26.447
So, I guess you'd be expecting
a new video now, right?

34:30.016 --> 34:34.387
I don't know, Frank, that
could be Fulton, couldn't it?

34:35.523 --> 34:38.492
No, Smith can't
be this stupid.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.860
Okay, we're
gonna arrest him now.

34:42.862 --> 34:45.797
Make sure he
doesn't use his phone.

34:45.800 --> 34:46.898
Roger that.

34:51.070 --> 34:53.072
He's running, get him!

35:00.914 --> 35:02.448
Did you get him?

35:03.550 --> 35:04.749
Just a second.

35:04.751 --> 35:06.849
My men are with him now.

35:06.851 --> 35:08.584
Mm-mm, way too easy.

35:08.586 --> 35:10.019
I don't know, he was running.

35:10.021 --> 35:11.554
Didn't you just say
check everything twice

35:11.556 --> 35:13.891
before you draw conclusions?

35:14.960 --> 35:15.892
Frank?

35:15.894 --> 35:19.030
I'm sorry, but this
is not Walter Smith.

35:20.498 --> 35:23.833
His driver's license,
my men checked it.

35:23.835 --> 35:26.635
Arrest him anyway.

35:26.637 --> 35:27.769
Why?

35:27.771 --> 35:28.771
Why?

35:28.773 --> 35:30.574
Because I just ordered you to.

35:30.576 --> 35:32.976
Frank, he's innocent,
you need to calm down.

35:32.978 --> 35:35.510
Cohen, did you just hear me?

35:35.512 --> 35:36.945
I did, roger that.

35:36.947 --> 35:38.680
I don't get it.

35:38.682 --> 35:39.981
I don't get it either,

35:39.983 --> 35:42.952
but this cannot be a
coincidence, can it?

35:59.969 --> 36:01.003
What?

36:04.673 --> 36:09.110
Alright, you took a moron
and paid him to run off.

36:09.112 --> 36:11.612
It's difficult
to win when you can't cheat

36:11.614 --> 36:13.615
like your NSA, isn't it?

36:14.849 --> 36:16.818
I have a question.

36:16.820 --> 36:18.920
Don't
expect an answer.

36:18.922 --> 36:21.255
Oh, quoting the
NSA now, are we?

36:21.257 --> 36:23.724
Alright, well then, if
your friend was innocent,

36:23.726 --> 36:25.825
how did he know when to run?

36:25.827 --> 36:29.831
Mr. Kovacich,
two can play that game.

36:33.101 --> 36:36.670
Of course, you
bugged my phone.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.637
Frank, how could he
have bugged your phone?

36:38.639 --> 36:40.840
I don't know, but he did.

36:40.842 --> 36:41.907
Well, think!

36:41.909 --> 36:42.874
Who have you been
in contact with?

36:42.876 --> 36:43.710
Nobody.

36:45.547 --> 36:47.246
I'm shutting down my
phone now, Mr. Smith.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.148
Taking out the battery.

36:49.150 --> 36:49.983
See?

36:57.090 --> 36:59.259
Who has my private number?

37:03.063 --> 37:04.130
Son of a bitch!

37:06.266 --> 37:10.302
Now you know
how it feels, Mr. Kovacich.

37:10.304 --> 37:13.304
And for the record,
every time we speak,

37:13.306 --> 37:15.972
I'm using a
different cell phone.

37:15.974 --> 37:19.209
So you don't need to try to
track me down that way again.

37:19.211 --> 37:22.246
We don't like to make
the same joke twice.

37:22.248 --> 37:23.250
Who is we?

37:24.684 --> 37:26.218
Hey there!

37:27.686 --> 37:29.619
If you're not Sarah,

37:29.621 --> 37:32.923
then you must be Frank's
trusted right hand.

37:32.925 --> 37:34.093
Brenda, right?

37:35.126 --> 37:37.628
How did you do it?

37:37.630 --> 37:40.030
So Brenda
is in the game too?

37:40.032 --> 37:41.197
Interesting.

37:41.199 --> 37:42.731
Welcome, Brenda.

37:42.733 --> 37:44.967
No, leave her out of this.

37:44.969 --> 37:47.003
You
brought her in, Frank,

37:47.005 --> 37:48.871
you can't change the rules.

37:48.873 --> 37:51.974
How did you do it?

37:51.976 --> 37:55.045
Frank, you need
to listen to this.

37:56.347 --> 37:57.880
Arrest him anyway.

37:57.882 --> 37:59.115
Why?

37:59.117 --> 38:01.016
Why, because
I just ordered you to.

38:01.018 --> 38:03.050
Frank, he's
innocent, you need to calm down.

38:03.052 --> 38:04.253
Cohen, did
you just hear me?

38:04.255 --> 38:06.755
I did, roger that.

38:06.757 --> 38:08.191
Arrest him anyway.

38:08.193 --> 38:09.624
Why?

38:09.626 --> 38:11.193
Why, because
I just ordered you to.

38:11.195 --> 38:12.693
And there's text.

38:12.695 --> 38:14.762
Is this the NSA
this country wants?

38:14.764 --> 38:15.665
More to come.

38:16.967 --> 38:18.333
Arrest him anyway.

38:18.335 --> 38:19.800
Why?

38:19.802 --> 38:22.037
Tell him
the views, Brenda.

38:22.039 --> 38:24.575
It's going quick.

38:26.909 --> 38:29.776
What do
you want, Smith?

38:29.778 --> 38:32.313
Why don't you
tell me, Mr. Kovacich?

38:32.315 --> 38:33.481
That's your job.

38:33.483 --> 38:36.684
You have so much illegally
obtained data to work with.

38:36.686 --> 38:37.418
God damn it!

38:37.420 --> 38:39.688
Just tell me what you want!

38:41.224 --> 38:45.059
You sound pretty
desperate, Mr. Kovacich.

38:45.061 --> 38:49.229
I guess you both need
a little more help.

38:49.231 --> 38:51.032
Look at the screen.

38:55.771 --> 38:58.070
You think he could
eavesdrop any other way?

38:58.072 --> 38:58.905
Here?

38:58.907 --> 39:00.175
Absolutely not.

39:04.813 --> 39:07.048
Is it attached to his knee?

39:12.286 --> 39:13.851
Get me Cohen.

39:13.853 --> 39:15.188
Yeah.

39:17.692 --> 39:19.992
Commissioner Cohen, I
have Kovacich again.

39:19.994 --> 39:21.728
Thank you, sir.

39:21.730 --> 39:25.296
Listen, Smith is entering
a subway station again.

39:25.298 --> 39:28.333
I want all your men
check anyone wearing

39:28.335 --> 39:30.068
pants with knee pockets.

39:30.070 --> 39:31.804
Really?

39:31.806 --> 39:36.108
Or a camera attached
to his knee or close to it.

39:36.110 --> 39:37.476
You're kidding, right?

39:37.478 --> 39:39.411
Listen, I wish I was.

39:39.413 --> 39:41.278
But if anyone
protests, arrest them.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.949
Don't let anyone go.

39:44.284 --> 39:47.117
- In which subway station?
- Every subway station.

39:47.119 --> 39:48.753
Frank.

39:48.755 --> 39:50.320
Look, I don't
think we're allowed

39:50.322 --> 39:53.257
to just go in there and
arrest anybody we want to.

39:53.259 --> 39:55.760
Listen, this is the
Director General of the NSA,

39:55.762 --> 39:58.128
I'm giving you a direct order.

39:58.130 --> 39:59.965
Cohen, please confirm.

40:00.998 --> 40:03.167
Yes, roger that.

40:05.804 --> 40:10.474
Didn't think about that,
did you, you son of a bitch?

40:16.882 --> 40:18.916
Zoe, make me happy, please.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.251
I'm afraid I can't.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.854
That's all I've got.

40:23.856 --> 40:26.822
We're still checking
on some leads, Frank.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.192
Okay, thank you.

40:30.061 --> 40:33.394
Call me back if you
find out anything.

40:33.396 --> 40:35.331
- Frank.
- You got it.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.468
Frank, look at the upload.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.938
It's going so fast, I
think we have to stop it.

40:42.940 --> 40:43.941
No.

40:45.775 --> 40:48.010
No, I want Elizabeth to live.

40:49.045 --> 40:51.847
Then stop it temporarily.

40:51.849 --> 40:54.215
Do you understand
what's at stake here?

40:54.217 --> 40:57.284
Frank, do you understand
what's at stake here?

40:57.286 --> 40:59.554
Do you really wanna
be the next Snowden?

40:59.556 --> 41:00.854
No, I love my country.

41:00.856 --> 41:02.423
That's exactly
what Snowden said.

41:02.425 --> 41:03.856
Then what
do you want me to do?

41:03.858 --> 41:04.958
I need you to
stop it temporarily.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.128
I can't, I can't stop it!

41:13.235 --> 41:15.135
Frank.

41:15.137 --> 41:16.271
I can't, okay?

41:19.307 --> 41:21.008
Sir.

41:21.010 --> 41:23.075
All my available men are
checking anyone wearing pants

41:23.077 --> 41:26.012
with knee pockets or a camera
attached to their knee,

41:26.014 --> 41:28.816
and I'm telling you, people
don't react well at all.

41:28.818 --> 41:33.485
I'm getting more arrests
than I am information.

41:33.487 --> 41:36.255
Jesus Christ, Frank.

41:36.257 --> 41:39.159
We're at 62,000 views already.

41:39.161 --> 41:40.226
Cohen!

41:40.228 --> 41:41.594
He's running!

41:41.596 --> 41:43.362
I think it's Union
Station, you can get him!

41:43.364 --> 41:45.331
Get him right now, okay?

41:45.333 --> 41:46.932
He's running, guys!

41:46.934 --> 41:49.101
Just a second,
I'll be right back.

41:52.873 --> 41:54.840
Listen, we now have two men

41:54.842 --> 41:56.374
with those kind of pants

41:56.376 --> 41:59.144
running at two different
subway stations.

41:59.146 --> 42:01.545
You got two men running?

42:01.547 --> 42:02.914
Yes, right now.

42:02.916 --> 42:03.882
Two men.

42:03.884 --> 42:06.184
We're checking everywhere.

42:06.186 --> 42:08.355
No, he's still running.

42:09.556 --> 42:12.425
Don't let him make a phone call.

42:27.139 --> 42:29.206
Jesus Christ.

42:29.208 --> 42:33.244
- ♪ Happy birthday to you love
- I need a drink.

42:33.246 --> 42:34.545
Cohen!

42:34.547 --> 42:36.112
You know
it's my birthday?

42:36.114 --> 42:38.581
- No it's not.
- Not my fault.

42:38.583 --> 42:40.117
Sir.

42:40.119 --> 42:40.952
Yes.

42:42.989 --> 42:45.921
We arrested
one of those two men.

42:45.923 --> 42:48.057
Only one of them?

42:48.059 --> 42:50.025
Look, don't let him
make any phone calls.

42:50.027 --> 42:51.161
You ask him where
my daughter is,

42:51.163 --> 42:54.530
and if he doesn't tell you,
you beat it out of him.

42:54.532 --> 42:56.367
- What?
- You heard me.

42:58.103 --> 43:01.537
I heard you, but
I'm gonna pretend I didn't.

43:01.539 --> 43:04.042
Oh, wait a minute, wait, wait.

43:05.108 --> 43:06.610
It's not him, sir.

43:10.014 --> 43:12.616
What about the second runner?

43:14.251 --> 43:15.483
He got away, sir.

43:15.485 --> 43:16.319
I'm sorry.

43:20.523 --> 43:23.460
Frank, you need
to call for help.

43:24.994 --> 43:26.461
Well, it's not like
I can call Anderson.

43:26.463 --> 43:27.963
He's sick.

43:27.965 --> 43:29.597
Then call somebody else.

43:29.599 --> 43:32.934
You can't make this
decision alone.

43:32.936 --> 43:35.037
Yes, actually, I can.

43:36.438 --> 43:39.072
Frank, this is insane.

43:39.074 --> 43:42.043
It's too much responsibility
for one person.

43:42.045 --> 43:44.045
I have Anderson's
private number.

43:44.047 --> 43:44.880
Call it.

43:47.483 --> 43:48.517
Do it!

43:55.525 --> 43:57.023
Yeah, this is Frank Kovacich.

43:57.025 --> 43:59.060
Is Mr. Anderson in, please?

44:01.697 --> 44:03.999
Sorry to hear about that.

44:07.735 --> 44:10.369
It's food poisoning
or something.

44:10.371 --> 44:12.440
It's a bunch of bullshit.

44:23.050 --> 44:23.684
Yes?

44:25.552 --> 44:28.387
This will be
huge on the internet.

44:28.389 --> 44:29.755
Police officers
checking all those

44:29.757 --> 44:32.257
civilians with knee pockets.

44:32.259 --> 44:35.492
Isn't that discrimination
of people with knee pockets?

44:35.494 --> 44:37.128
Oh, listen to this.

44:37.130 --> 44:38.563
You beat it out of him.

44:38.565 --> 44:39.429
If he doesn't tell you,

44:39.431 --> 44:40.498
you beat it out of him.

44:40.500 --> 44:41.400
If he doesn't tell you,

44:41.402 --> 44:43.034
you beat it out of him.

44:43.036 --> 44:44.101
If he doesn't tell you,

44:44.103 --> 44:46.003
you beat it out of him.

44:46.005 --> 44:47.204
If he doesn't tell you,
you beat it out of him.

44:47.206 --> 44:48.373
Shit.

44:48.375 --> 44:51.309
Cohen's phone is bugged too.

44:51.311 --> 44:54.280
I'll get him on
my private line.

44:55.646 --> 44:58.282
You should read
the comments on the internet.

44:58.284 --> 45:00.584
People call us freedom fighters,

45:00.586 --> 45:04.521
Americans who love their
country, Mr. Kovacich.

45:04.523 --> 45:05.356
Shit.

45:07.159 --> 45:10.092
You still
don't get it, do you?

45:10.094 --> 45:12.262
Your time is running out.

45:12.264 --> 45:15.231
So you'll need more help.

45:15.233 --> 45:17.601
I'm helping you Mr. Kovacich.

45:17.603 --> 45:19.403
Look at the screen.

45:19.405 --> 45:23.575
If he doesn't tell
you, you beat it out of him.

45:29.481 --> 45:30.549
Oh, my god.

45:32.784 --> 45:33.617
Yes, yes.

45:35.286 --> 45:37.219
I have Cohen.

45:37.221 --> 45:38.554
Cohen?

45:38.556 --> 45:39.820
Listen, he's wearing a
police officer's uniform.

45:39.822 --> 45:44.459
Confirm the identity of
every police officer.

45:44.461 --> 45:47.563
Look, I don't think
I can ask my men to do that.

45:47.565 --> 45:49.130
This is a direct order, Cohen.

45:49.132 --> 45:52.534
You gonna refuse a direct
order from the NSA?

45:52.536 --> 45:53.601
No, sir.

45:53.603 --> 45:56.371
Then do it, right now!

45:56.373 --> 45:59.376
Frank, the internet
is exploding.

46:00.844 --> 46:02.443
Do you wanna know how
many views we're at?

46:02.445 --> 46:03.811
No!

46:03.813 --> 46:05.315
Just let me think.

46:08.384 --> 46:10.450
Listen, I want the
names of the people

46:10.452 --> 46:14.121
who were fired at the NSA
in the last five years.

46:14.123 --> 46:15.688
You want that including the
ones about to be replaced?

46:15.690 --> 46:17.724
How would they know they
were going to be replaced?

46:17.726 --> 46:19.459
Because it's the NSA, right?

46:19.461 --> 46:21.128
People know things they're
not supposed to know?

46:21.130 --> 46:23.197
Just give me the names.

46:23.199 --> 46:24.166
I'll call Tim.

46:29.105 --> 46:30.403
NSA.

46:30.405 --> 46:33.340
Yeah, please connect me
to congressman Miller.

46:41.148 --> 46:41.782
Shit.

46:45.420 --> 46:47.422
Shit, where's Elizabeth?

46:49.123 --> 46:51.190
Where's Elizabeth?

46:51.192 --> 46:51.858
Is she...

46:51.860 --> 46:53.325
I mean, I don't know.

46:53.327 --> 46:55.459
The dog couldn't have
swallowed her whole.

46:55.461 --> 46:57.295
Yeah, but...

46:59.601 --> 47:01.400
I don't know, maybe he
pushed her out of frame?

47:01.402 --> 47:02.666
When was the last
time you looked?

47:02.668 --> 47:05.638
I don't know,
couple of minutes ago.

47:07.807 --> 47:08.641
Wait.

47:10.143 --> 47:11.876
Could she be in New York?

47:11.878 --> 47:14.313
Is he going to her right now?

47:15.581 --> 47:18.349
Frank,
is that 50th Street?

47:18.351 --> 47:19.583
Yeah.

47:19.585 --> 47:21.751
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is.

47:21.753 --> 47:22.619
Okay, look.

47:22.621 --> 47:24.588
Cohen, Cohen.

47:24.590 --> 47:25.555
He's at 50th Street.

47:25.557 --> 47:27.490
Subway station at 6th Avenue.

47:27.492 --> 47:28.858
It's the northbound platform.

47:28.860 --> 47:30.795
I'm positive this time.

47:31.931 --> 47:33.130
Roger that.

47:33.132 --> 47:33.697
We got people everywhere sir,
I'll send them right away.

47:33.699 --> 47:36.233
Yes, get him, Cohen!

47:36.235 --> 47:38.767
One of your guys is talking
to him on the north platform.

47:38.769 --> 47:40.403
You tell him to be very careful.

47:40.405 --> 47:43.374
Confiscate his
phone immediately.

47:44.443 --> 47:46.412
Roger that, sir.

47:48.780 --> 47:51.313
Cohen, Smith is
fighting with the officer!

47:51.315 --> 47:54.383
Stop him, kill him
if you have to!

48:04.628 --> 48:05.827
Fuck.

48:05.829 --> 48:07.896
Smith's on a Six
uptown train at 77th.

48:07.898 --> 48:11.532
Tell me you have
someone on that train.

48:11.534 --> 48:15.737
Cohen, I want you to tell me
you have a man on that train.

48:15.739 --> 48:19.907
And if you see Smith I
want you to shoot him.

48:19.909 --> 48:21.642
I'm sorry,
sir, we don't.

48:21.644 --> 48:23.244
The next stop is 86th street.

48:23.246 --> 48:25.278
Do you have men over
there on 86th street?

48:25.280 --> 48:29.152
The train will arrive
in exactly 40 seconds.

48:30.353 --> 48:31.920
No, too soon.

48:31.922 --> 48:34.554
But we may arrive in time
for the next exit, at 103rd.

48:34.556 --> 48:35.755
I'll get my men over there.

48:35.757 --> 48:37.391
No, no, no, no you'll see
he'll get out at the next exit.

48:37.393 --> 48:39.626
You'll see this.

48:39.628 --> 48:41.764
Come on, stay on the train.

48:43.699 --> 48:45.700
Stay on the train, please.

48:45.702 --> 48:48.369
Frank, I've got Zoe for you.

48:48.371 --> 48:49.936
He's gonna get out.

48:49.938 --> 48:54.307
Frank, Frank,
Zoe's on the phone.

48:54.309 --> 48:56.378
I knew it, he's staying.

48:57.746 --> 48:59.648
We got him, we got him.

49:02.784 --> 49:04.818
Smith's still on the train.

49:04.820 --> 49:07.519
Cohen, Smith's
still on the train.

49:07.521 --> 49:10.755
Great, we'll
swarm him at 103rd street.

49:10.757 --> 49:12.258
How's the countdown?

49:12.260 --> 49:14.860
It's going fast,
Frank, Zoe wants you.

49:14.862 --> 49:15.494
Zoe.

49:17.833 --> 49:18.998
Frank, what's happening?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.432
Where are you?

49:20.434 --> 49:21.666
The internet
is exploding!

49:21.668 --> 49:24.836
Yeah, I know that,
did you find Elizabeth?

49:24.838 --> 49:25.804
Yes.

49:25.806 --> 49:27.305
She's in Trenton, New Jersey.

49:27.307 --> 49:29.840
A residential house with
a secluded back yard.

49:29.842 --> 49:33.311
Okay, is there
an exact address?

49:33.313 --> 49:35.880
65 Apple Street,
on the west side.

49:35.882 --> 49:37.914
65 Apple Street.

49:37.916 --> 49:39.349
You know it?

49:39.351 --> 49:40.385
It sounds vaguely familiar.

49:40.387 --> 49:43.387
Is she alive, is she okay?

49:43.389 --> 49:45.055
I think so,
they heard her crying.

49:45.057 --> 49:46.423
Look, hold on, I'm gonna get you

49:46.425 --> 49:47.691
the local commander on the line.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.059
Okay.

49:49.061 --> 49:52.729
Here, I have
Commander Garcia in Trenton.

49:52.731 --> 49:54.032
This is Garcia.

49:54.034 --> 49:56.666
Garcia, listen,
whatever you do,

49:56.668 --> 49:57.967
don't shoot that dog, okay?

49:57.969 --> 50:00.503
Smith might have
hidden explosives.

50:00.505 --> 50:01.604
We know, sir.

50:01.606 --> 50:03.007
We have the
neighborhood evacuated.

50:03.009 --> 50:05.441
A dog trainer will be
here with us shortly.

50:05.443 --> 50:07.610
We'll get your daughter
out of the dog kennel, sir.

50:07.612 --> 50:09.614
Thank you, thank you.

50:10.715 --> 50:13.650
How long till the
train hits 103rd?

50:13.652 --> 50:16.588
About two minutes
and 15 seconds.

50:17.956 --> 50:21.691
No, no, no, no, I don't
like it, it's too long.

50:21.693 --> 50:22.527
Cohen?

50:23.460 --> 50:24.760
Yes sir.

50:24.762 --> 50:27.362
Tell me your men
are at 103rd street.

50:27.364 --> 50:29.065
Yes, we're
here waiting for Smith.

50:29.067 --> 50:30.700
Great, okay.

50:30.702 --> 50:33.568
We'll get the bastard now.

50:33.570 --> 50:35.604
We have
the area surrounded.

50:35.606 --> 50:37.072
What else can we do for you?

50:37.074 --> 50:39.008
Nothing, that's,
everything's great.

50:39.010 --> 50:41.842
Thank you, thank you
so much for everything.

50:41.844 --> 50:45.880
Listen, I'm sorry for
my behavior, okay?

50:45.882 --> 50:47.349
No problem.

50:47.351 --> 50:49.117
I've got two little
kids at home, sir.

50:49.119 --> 50:51.822
Frank, we're at two minutes.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.526
It's Walter.

50:59.528 --> 51:01.128
Keep him on the phone
so we can stall him.

51:01.130 --> 51:03.998
We have one minute, 30 seconds.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.668
Walter, um, how are you
talking to us right now?

51:07.670 --> 51:10.804
Are you on a satellite phone?

51:10.806 --> 51:13.106
Does it
matter, Mr. Kovacich?

51:13.108 --> 51:15.708
You're not trying to
stall me, are you?

51:15.710 --> 51:17.443
Why would I do that, Walter?

51:18.447 --> 51:20.880
You tell me.

51:20.882 --> 51:23.617
30 seconds.

51:23.619 --> 51:26.820
How does your phone
work on the subway?

51:26.822 --> 51:29.889
I'm getting
bored of all this talking.

51:29.891 --> 51:33.059
Where are my files,
Mr. Kovacich?

51:33.061 --> 51:36.595
I'm getting really in the
mood to feed that dog.

51:36.597 --> 51:38.097
- Make an offer.
- What kind of offer?

51:38.099 --> 51:39.465
Anything.

51:39.467 --> 51:42.434
We're one minute, 40 seconds.

51:42.436 --> 51:46.440
Um, Walter, I would
like to make you an offer.

51:48.175 --> 51:51.844
Really,
what is the offer?

51:51.846 --> 51:53.579
What do you want?

51:53.581 --> 51:56.581
One
minute, 10 seconds.

51:56.583 --> 51:59.550
What about Brenda?

51:59.552 --> 52:01.653
W-, what about her?

52:01.655 --> 52:04.557
Will
Brenda do anything?

52:06.159 --> 52:09.728
- Yes, yes, yes she will.
- One minute.

52:09.730 --> 52:11.195
I'll get back to you.

52:21.141 --> 52:24.510
Cohen, are your
men at the platform?

52:26.012 --> 52:27.478
Yes sir.

52:27.480 --> 52:28.378
We have the whole
area surrounded.

52:28.380 --> 52:30.046
Arrest everyone on
that train, Cohen.

52:30.048 --> 52:30.882
Everyone.

52:32.184 --> 52:33.650
I can't do that, sir.

52:33.652 --> 52:34.918
It's a direct order.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.554
Frank,
think of the internet.

52:36.556 --> 52:38.222
I don't care.

52:38.224 --> 52:42.124
You arrest everyone on that
goddamn train, you hear me?

52:42.126 --> 52:43.860
Roger that.

52:43.862 --> 52:47.162
Christ, we're close
to a million views already.

52:47.164 --> 52:50.934
Cohen, do not let
him make a phone call.

52:50.936 --> 52:52.534
Roger that, sir.

52:52.536 --> 52:55.104
We're at 30 seconds.

52:55.106 --> 52:55.940
Garcia?

52:57.074 --> 52:58.708
Yes, sir.

52:58.710 --> 53:01.543
How did we find
that last address?

53:01.545 --> 53:05.248
It's the old
house of Walter Smith, sir.

53:05.250 --> 53:07.816
That's it, that's it,
I know where he's going.

53:07.818 --> 53:09.617
I know where he's going.

53:09.619 --> 53:12.787
He's going to the place
where I arrested him.

53:12.789 --> 53:13.623
20.

53:19.094 --> 53:21.029
We're at nine seconds.

53:23.900 --> 53:24.734
Frank.

53:27.070 --> 53:29.036
Shouldn't the train
be slowing down?

53:29.038 --> 53:33.007
Why is the train not
slowing down, Cohen?

53:33.009 --> 53:34.275
We're here sir.

53:34.277 --> 53:35.909
The train is slowing
down, we can hear it.

53:35.911 --> 53:36.878
No, it's not.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.213
I'm watching it right now.

53:39.215 --> 53:41.215
It's stopping, sir.

53:41.217 --> 53:44.119
Frank, we're at zero.

53:52.295 --> 53:54.693
W-, w-, what's happening?

53:54.695 --> 53:56.128
Damn it, what's happening?

53:56.130 --> 53:57.930
I think we're not
seeing it right.

53:57.932 --> 53:59.199
I can't take this
anymore, what's going on?

53:59.201 --> 54:00.566
I mean,
does Walter have

54:00.568 --> 54:03.202
any connection to the subway?

54:03.204 --> 54:05.970
Yes, yes, actually.

54:05.972 --> 54:07.273
If I remember right,

54:07.275 --> 54:08.974
he said he used to work
for them or something.

54:08.976 --> 54:11.144
He altered the
surveillance feeds somehow.

54:11.146 --> 54:12.744
If anyone could do it,
it would be Walter Smith.

54:12.746 --> 54:14.848
That's what happened.

54:17.284 --> 54:18.751
Shit.

54:20.887 --> 54:21.721
What?

54:24.057 --> 54:24.891
Cohen.

54:26.793 --> 54:27.961
- Cohen!
- Cohen?

54:30.864 --> 54:34.967
- Where are you going?
- I'll get him on the line.

54:37.605 --> 54:38.804
His phone is dead.

54:38.806 --> 54:40.074
Shit.

54:42.976 --> 54:44.010
What?

54:45.344 --> 54:49.246
There's a delay,
he's way ahead of us.

54:49.248 --> 54:50.180
What do you mean?

54:50.182 --> 54:51.581
He's transferring
it through a router

54:51.583 --> 54:52.951
and creating a delay.

54:54.887 --> 54:58.621
So he was way ahead
of us all the time.

54:58.623 --> 54:59.257
Fuck.

55:03.728 --> 55:05.864
Garcia, can you see the dog?

55:07.800 --> 55:09.032
Not yet, sir.

55:09.034 --> 55:12.336
I'm with the dog handler
now, we're heading over.

55:12.338 --> 55:14.106
Hurry up, please.

55:15.373 --> 55:17.305
We got the
property evacuated.

55:17.307 --> 55:19.175
Canine specialist is
crossing the street

55:19.177 --> 55:21.309
to the back yard now.

55:23.882 --> 55:27.719
No, don't you dare,
don't you touch my baby!

55:34.025 --> 55:36.891
God, Frank, are you okay?

55:36.893 --> 55:38.894
Never better, thanks.

55:40.297 --> 55:43.666
We need to figure out
who's helping Walter.

55:43.668 --> 55:45.766
We need to figure out
if there's a bomb.

55:45.768 --> 55:47.769
Could you please just
get me the warden

55:47.771 --> 55:49.771
of the prison Walter
Smith was sent?

55:49.773 --> 55:50.807
Please?

55:52.108 --> 55:53.941
Sir, it's Garcia.

55:53.943 --> 55:55.277
What happened?

55:56.947 --> 55:59.680
Sir, the dog handler
heard about the explosion.

55:59.682 --> 56:01.383
We can't get him to
approach the house.

56:01.385 --> 56:03.217
We have to wait for
the bomb squad, okay?

56:03.219 --> 56:06.420
Jesus Christ, yeah, okay.

56:06.422 --> 56:08.421
God damn it!

56:10.726 --> 56:11.791
Cohen, where were you?

56:11.793 --> 56:14.193
Call me back on
my private line.

56:14.195 --> 56:15.329
Look, I'm sorry, sir.

56:15.331 --> 56:17.063
He's not on the train.

56:17.065 --> 56:19.032
We arrested all passengers,

56:19.034 --> 56:21.200
but people are
getting really angry.

56:21.202 --> 56:23.036
Can I let them go?

56:23.038 --> 56:26.305
Is there anyone who can't
verify their identity?

56:26.307 --> 56:29.275
We have a few tourists
that don't speak English.

56:29.277 --> 56:31.443
Just hold them.

56:31.445 --> 56:33.679
Sir, people
are getting angry.

56:33.681 --> 56:35.213
They want an explanation.

56:35.215 --> 56:36.416
They're filming on
their cell phones,

56:36.418 --> 56:37.883
and we can't control it.

56:37.885 --> 56:40.219
I mean, we'll have the
media down here soon.

56:40.221 --> 56:44.456
Just check them
again, that's an order, Cohen.

56:44.458 --> 56:46.124
Roger that.

56:46.126 --> 56:49.297
How many
minutes do we have?

56:51.898 --> 56:55.967
Jesus Christ, only
14 minutes to download.

56:55.969 --> 57:00.140
Frank, you've gotta think, why
is Smith doing this to you?

57:05.378 --> 57:07.077
Frank?

57:07.079 --> 57:09.380
Yeah, there is something.

57:09.382 --> 57:11.050
Frank, what is it?

57:13.253 --> 57:15.322
This stays between us.

57:17.422 --> 57:19.724
This can never get out.

57:19.726 --> 57:21.827
I promise you, tell me.

57:28.501 --> 57:30.934
Frank, you have my word.

57:30.936 --> 57:31.903
We have 14 minutes

57:31.905 --> 57:34.470
until he doesn't care
about Elizabeth anymore.

57:34.472 --> 57:36.141
You have to tell me.

57:37.409 --> 57:40.478
Well, uh, in case
you ever wondered

57:40.480 --> 57:43.449
how I got this job
in the first place?

57:50.989 --> 57:52.023
Tim.

57:52.989 --> 57:54.255
Congratulations.

57:54.257 --> 57:57.760
I heard you arrested
your first terrorist.

57:57.762 --> 58:01.030
No, I believe he's
innocent, I really do.

58:01.032 --> 58:02.264
Walter Smith is
completely innocent.

58:02.266 --> 58:04.199
My old buddy Timothy.

58:04.201 --> 58:06.501
Congressman Miller?

58:06.503 --> 58:07.536
Yeah.

58:07.538 --> 58:08.503
You'll
learn that the NSA

58:08.505 --> 58:10.104
doesn't believe in coincidences.

58:10.106 --> 58:12.840
Yeah, hey, but listen, um,

58:12.842 --> 58:16.545
the hospital just
called, and his wife,

58:16.547 --> 58:19.081
she lost their
baby, because of me.

58:19.083 --> 58:22.086
He placed me here,
on one condition.

58:25.255 --> 58:27.054
What are
you talking about?

58:27.056 --> 58:29.791
I got carried away, I
mean it was my first arrest,

58:29.793 --> 58:33.561
and I swarmed into his
house with half a dozen men,

58:33.563 --> 58:36.898
it was unnecessary force.

58:36.900 --> 58:40.135
His wife, she, she
fell from the stairs.

58:44.541 --> 58:45.908
It's my fault.

58:47.510 --> 58:50.177
Accidents happen
at arrests, Frank.

58:50.179 --> 58:52.211
You never know who
the terrorist is.

58:52.213 --> 58:55.282
Yeah, but I knew he wasn't.

58:55.284 --> 58:57.349
I sent in 25 men to arrest him

58:57.351 --> 59:00.019
when I could have
done it with two.

59:00.021 --> 59:04.192
Stop blaming
yourself, it's not your fault.

59:05.561 --> 59:10.295
Listen, I know you
brought me into the NSA,

59:10.297 --> 59:13.233
and for that I really
do appreciate it

59:13.235 --> 59:15.101
more than you can
possibly ever know,

59:15.103 --> 59:16.037
but I just,

59:17.271 --> 59:19.170
I just don't think that I'm
cut out for this kind of work,

59:19.172 --> 59:20.440
I really don't.

59:21.576 --> 59:23.876
What would you say

59:23.878 --> 59:28.981
if I'd make you Deputy
Director of the NSA, Frank?

59:28.983 --> 59:30.484
I can make it happen.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.117
What?

59:33.119 --> 59:36.287
I just need
complete loyalty.

59:36.289 --> 59:37.621
And as number two,

59:37.623 --> 59:39.324
you could do great things
in the future, Frank.

59:39.326 --> 59:41.425
You love your
country, don't you?

59:41.427 --> 59:42.895
Think about it.

59:44.097 --> 59:46.930
We need people who we can trust.

59:46.932 --> 59:48.099
And I trust you.

59:48.101 --> 59:51.068
Now how long do we go back?

59:51.070 --> 59:53.103
Think about it.

59:53.105 --> 59:55.639
You'll get married next week.

59:55.641 --> 59:57.574
You'll make $30K a month.

59:57.576 --> 59:59.077
If you turn this down,

59:59.079 --> 01:00:02.278
you'd deprive Sarah of
a real nice life, Frank.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.650
Now listen, first you've
got to help me here,

01:00:06.652 --> 01:00:10.556
I really need you to
convict this Walter Smith.

01:00:21.498 --> 01:00:23.201
It's the warden.

01:00:25.637 --> 01:00:27.305
John Roani, take it.

01:00:33.644 --> 01:00:36.077
Mr. Roani, this is
Frank Kovacich, NSA.

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:37.679
We need your help.

01:00:37.681 --> 01:00:40.215
Mr. Kovacich, I
see on the media you do.

01:00:40.217 --> 01:00:42.050
How can I help?

01:00:42.052 --> 01:00:44.153
I need a list of
anyone who ever visited

01:00:44.155 --> 01:00:47.289
Walter Alexander Smith,
and I need it right away.

01:00:47.291 --> 01:00:49.257
You should
talk to his lawyer.

01:00:49.259 --> 01:00:51.959
I'm afraid this is a matter
of life and death, sir.

01:00:51.961 --> 01:00:56.095
Sir, you still
need to talk to his lawyer.

01:00:56.097 --> 01:00:59.934
Mr. Roani, do
you have children?

01:00:59.936 --> 01:01:02.336
No, sir, I
haven't had the pleasure.

01:01:02.338 --> 01:01:04.438
Well, imagine that
you have a child.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.041
And that child has
been kidnapped.

01:01:07.043 --> 01:01:08.474
And the only thing that's
gonna keep that child alive

01:01:08.476 --> 01:01:10.344
is a complete list of
anyone who ever visited

01:01:10.346 --> 01:01:14.280
Walter Smith in
prison, you understand?

01:01:14.282 --> 01:01:15.581
Still, you
should talk to his lawyer.

01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:18.353
Listen, John, can I say John?

01:01:19.554 --> 01:01:21.554
Well, I don't know you.

01:01:21.556 --> 01:01:23.588
Okay, Mr. Roani, listen.

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:25.557
We're here trying to
help you find him,

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:28.193
but you are obstructing justice.

01:01:28.195 --> 01:01:29.898
Find who?

01:01:31.199 --> 01:01:33.266
Walter Smith.

01:01:33.268 --> 01:01:35.300
Walter Alexander Smith.

01:01:35.302 --> 01:01:37.135
Yeah, that's him.

01:01:37.137 --> 01:01:39.539
What about him?

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:42.240
What about him, he's
in New York right now.

01:01:42.242 --> 01:01:43.541
No, he isn't.

01:01:43.543 --> 01:01:46.412
Yes, he is.

01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:48.648
Absolutely
not, he is here.

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:51.550
Walter Alexander
Smith, you're positive.

01:01:51.552 --> 01:01:54.086
I can see him right
now on one of my monitors.

01:01:54.088 --> 01:01:56.354
So Walter
Smith has not escaped?

01:01:56.356 --> 01:01:59.590
I'm sorry, sir,
somebody tricked the internet.

01:01:59.592 --> 01:02:02.494
Walter Smith is lying
in our infirmary.

01:02:02.496 --> 01:02:04.762
Are you sure, what happened?

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:07.666
Nothing, but I'm
sure his lawyer will tell you

01:02:07.668 --> 01:02:11.469
that Walter Smith
attempted suicide again.

01:02:11.471 --> 01:02:13.371
Thank you, Mr. Roani.

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.708
I don't get it.

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:35.126
Get Ashley and Dave, SSD.

01:02:35.128 --> 01:02:40.030
I need a complete list of all
the visitors of Walter Smith.

01:02:40.032 --> 01:02:42.534
They're gonna know what to do.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:57.079
And if there's anyone
listening to me, I don't care!

01:03:01.452 --> 01:03:03.054
Frank.

01:03:04.755 --> 01:03:07.688
I love my country, but
I love my baby even more,

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:10.626
and if you don't
like that, fuck you!

01:03:10.628 --> 01:03:12.628
Frank, it's Walter,
are you gonna get it?

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:14.528
No, that is not Walter.

01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:17.465
Walter Smith is in prison,
right where I put him.

01:03:17.467 --> 01:03:19.068
Well, fuck him!

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:23.070
Frank, are you gonna
get the call or not?

01:03:23.072 --> 01:03:24.137
Who is this?

01:03:24.139 --> 01:03:25.639
I know you're not Walter Smith.

01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:34.182
Well, it doesn't
really matter, does it?

01:03:34.184 --> 01:03:35.715
What matters, is that I'm sure

01:03:35.717 --> 01:03:38.519
I will find your name on
Walter Smith's visitors list.

01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:40.554
And I'm sure we can find
you in the last days

01:03:40.556 --> 01:03:43.322
on the security camera's around
Walter Smith's old house,

01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:47.461
so we've got you, whatever
happens, we've got you.

01:03:47.463 --> 01:03:50.530
And I'm sure the dog

01:03:50.532 --> 01:03:53.201
is getting more and more hungry.

01:03:55.204 --> 01:03:57.170
Does your offer still stand?

01:03:57.172 --> 01:03:58.340
Who are you?

01:04:00.273 --> 01:04:03.543
I'll tell
you if you accept

01:04:03.545 --> 01:04:05.878
my final proposition.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.715
We do not negotiate.

01:04:09.717 --> 01:04:10.883
Goodbye, then.

01:04:10.885 --> 01:04:11.719
Wait!

01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:14.521
Wait.

01:04:17.592 --> 01:04:20.325
Is this really your
final proposition,

01:04:20.327 --> 01:04:22.762
and then Elizabeth goes free?

01:04:24.297 --> 01:04:28.468
And then Elizabeth
is free, quid pro quo.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:32.769
How do I know that for sure?

01:04:32.771 --> 01:04:35.740
You have to trust me.

01:04:35.742 --> 01:04:38.244
Trust you, what do you want?

01:04:41.882 --> 01:04:44.449
I want
Brenda to carefully

01:04:44.451 --> 01:04:46.452
open the box I sent you.

01:04:55.693 --> 01:04:56.527
Go on.

01:05:21.753 --> 01:05:24.487
There's a mask.

01:05:24.489 --> 01:05:28.659
It's possibly the oldest
symbol of the American people.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:32.863
What do you want?

01:05:34.465 --> 01:05:38.169
I would
like Brenda to wear it.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:43.506
And?

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.641
And then
I just want you to do

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:50.312
what you like to do with Brenda.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:56.418
Which is?

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.320
You know, Frank.

01:06:00.322 --> 01:06:01.489
No, I don't.

01:06:03.525 --> 01:06:05.459
Think, Frank.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.762
What would you like
to do with Brenda?

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:08.765
Just say it.

01:06:10.865 --> 01:06:12.700
You suggested
it a couple of times

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:15.936
during the last
promotion period.

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:19.304
Come on, what is it
you're talking about?

01:06:19.306 --> 01:06:22.376
What is it that I would
like to do with Brenda?

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.947
Fuck her in the ass.

01:06:32.686 --> 01:06:34.188
How did, no, no.

01:06:37.559 --> 01:06:38.393
No way.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.662
Well then,
say goodbye to Elizabeth.

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:43.498
Wait!

01:06:44.797 --> 01:06:47.700
Listen, there must
be something else.

01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:52.005
I can't think
of any other visualization

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:56.441
than that of the soon to
be director of the NSA

01:06:56.443 --> 01:06:58.679
to fuck America in her ass.

01:07:04.916 --> 01:07:07.653
Is there a camera somewhere?

01:07:07.655 --> 01:07:09.054
You tell me.

01:07:09.056 --> 01:07:13.590
The NSA always denies that
they use secret camera's.

01:07:13.592 --> 01:07:16.793
Well, they check here every
morning, so there's no way.

01:07:16.795 --> 01:07:19.598
Brenda, how many more minutes?

01:07:27.974 --> 01:07:28.807
Seven.

01:07:31.777 --> 01:07:33.345
Close the blinds.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.983
Shouldn't you
ask her permission first?

01:07:39.985 --> 01:07:44.356
Oh, no, of course, I forgot,
you never ask permission.

01:07:54.465 --> 01:07:55.932
Come on, Brenda.

01:07:55.934 --> 01:07:56.900
Let's just give this
pervert what he wants, okay?

01:07:56.902 --> 01:07:58.400
And let's save Elizabeth.

01:07:58.402 --> 01:07:59.601
What does he mean,

01:07:59.603 --> 01:08:02.537
the soon to be director
of the NSA, Frank?

01:08:07.644 --> 01:08:10.713
So it was your
reorganization plan,

01:08:10.715 --> 01:08:13.784
not Anderson, not
Miller, it was you.

01:08:15.052 --> 01:08:17.818
Is that what your
announcement was about?

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:21.121
Firing all the
concerned NSA workers?

01:08:29.997 --> 01:08:34.368
There's one condition,
Smith, no cameras, no photos.

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.639
Do you see any?

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.143
And no sound recording,
your phone goes off.

01:08:42.145 --> 01:08:45.144
You just have to trust us.

01:08:45.145 --> 01:08:47.413
Can I
trust you, Frank?

01:08:47.416 --> 01:08:48.514
In this you can.

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:50.716
And even if you take a
picture, I will deny it anyway.

01:08:50.719 --> 01:08:52.618
Everybody will believe
it's Photoshopped.

01:08:52.621 --> 01:08:55.856
I'll turn it all around,
I've done it before.

01:08:55.858 --> 01:09:00.026
Four minutes, I want Elizabeth
free in four minutes.

01:09:00.028 --> 01:09:00.862
Deal?

01:09:04.064 --> 01:09:06.032
We have a deal.

01:09:07.402 --> 01:09:08.033
Really?

01:09:09.805 --> 01:09:11.106
Really.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.673
Alright.

01:09:17.712 --> 01:09:21.412
But I will see you
later, whoever you are.

01:09:21.413 --> 01:09:23.883
I will hunt you and I
promise I will catch you

01:09:23.885 --> 01:09:26.050
and you'll be sorry,
you understand that?

01:09:31.756 --> 01:09:33.157
Come on Brenda.

01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:34.125
Let's get this over with.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:35.460
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:36.126
No.

01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:37.629
We'll just pretend.

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.464
We won't do anything, I promise.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.665
We'll just pretend, alright?

01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:43.167
Listen, just do
this for me, okay?

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:44.636
Please, please.

01:09:45.837 --> 01:09:47.471
He can't check it.

01:09:47.474 --> 01:09:49.038
You don't know that for sure.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:51.008
You sweeped the room, right?

01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:55.045
Let's not play games with
Elizabeth's life here, please.

01:09:55.047 --> 01:09:56.214
Please, if you help
me, I will help you.

01:09:56.216 --> 01:09:59.450
I will get you any job you
need inside the NSA, I promise.

01:09:59.452 --> 01:10:01.751
I've done it before,
it's strictly business.

01:10:01.753 --> 01:10:02.587
Come on.

01:10:03.655 --> 01:10:04.987
Frank!

01:11:16.759 --> 01:11:19.795
This says we're
live in Times Square.

01:11:44.319 --> 01:11:46.420
There's a camera in here.

01:11:50.291 --> 01:11:52.023
You placed it here to film me.

01:11:52.025 --> 01:11:56.961
And it's all on the internet,
Frank, everything you said,

01:11:56.963 --> 01:12:00.167
edited of course,
the way the NSA does.

01:12:01.702 --> 01:12:03.768
And it shows you panicked.

01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:06.903
You used every means
necessary, legal or illegal,

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:08.973
to save your daughter,

01:12:08.975 --> 01:12:13.079
without even checking the
validity of the threat.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.882
You played me?

01:12:18.784 --> 01:12:20.084
I trusted you!

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:21.686
Really?

01:12:21.688 --> 01:12:23.321
You violated my privacy,

01:12:23.323 --> 01:12:25.621
you made a pass at me
during promotion time,

01:12:25.623 --> 01:12:27.924
and you were gonna fire me,

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:30.729
all for your own personal gain.

01:12:31.831 --> 01:12:34.000
Is there another camera?

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.768
This is what we call
a simulation, Frank.

01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:41.036
Everything in this
room was real.

01:12:41.038 --> 01:12:44.641
Your behavior was real,
the pressure was real,

01:12:44.643 --> 01:12:47.343
only Walter was a fake,

01:12:47.345 --> 01:12:50.813
him and Cohen and Garcia
and Zoe, of course.

01:12:50.815 --> 01:12:54.152
It was all one voice,
couldn't you tell?

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.887
This is entrapment.

01:12:57.889 --> 01:13:00.891
No, it was a test,
and you failed.

01:13:02.292 --> 01:13:05.393
What would have happened
if we were at war, Frank?

01:13:05.395 --> 01:13:09.766
It shows you would have caved
under any pressure at all.

01:13:15.972 --> 01:13:18.173
But you know what was real,

01:13:18.175 --> 01:13:21.041
was the uproar from
the internet, Frank.

01:13:21.043 --> 01:13:23.678
It seems that you've
caused a revolution.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.013
It seems everybody's outraged

01:13:25.015 --> 01:13:27.617
by your brutal misuse of power.

01:13:30.153 --> 01:13:31.253
Anderson.

01:13:34.056 --> 01:13:36.023
You made him sick when
you went into his office.

01:13:36.025 --> 01:13:38.325
Anderson was in
on this, Frank.

01:13:38.327 --> 01:13:40.760
He found out about your
reorganization plan.

01:13:40.762 --> 01:13:43.897
Decided the NSA needed
a public shakeup.

01:13:43.899 --> 01:13:46.933
We're chopping off our own
head to get rid of you.

01:13:46.935 --> 01:13:47.869
Prove it.

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:50.202
I don't need to.

01:13:50.204 --> 01:13:52.339
You'll find out soon enough.

01:13:52.341 --> 01:13:54.107
You talk about Edward Snowden,

01:13:54.109 --> 01:13:57.343
the man who brought
the NSA to its knees?

01:13:57.345 --> 01:13:58.844
Well, we are all Snowden.

01:13:58.846 --> 01:14:00.179
We are everywhere.

01:14:00.181 --> 01:14:01.714
And we're not gonna
stand for your brutal

01:14:01.716 --> 01:14:04.718
misuse of power ever again.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.753
This is not the right way.

01:14:07.755 --> 01:14:11.956
You can't start a
revolution with silk gloves.

01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:13.893
Are you quoting Joseph Stalin?

01:14:13.895 --> 01:14:14.994
I'm quoting
someone who actually

01:14:14.996 --> 01:14:17.095
managed to change
an entire country.

01:14:17.097 --> 01:14:18.798
He was a brutal dictator!

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.266
What would you have been,

01:14:20.268 --> 01:14:23.367
if you had actually managed
to take over the NSA?

01:14:26.038 --> 01:14:26.872
Oh my god.

01:14:28.942 --> 01:14:32.376
Somebody may have posted
your cellphone coordinates.

01:14:32.378 --> 01:14:35.381
I think they're
here for you, Frank.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:39.217
I'd be careful if I were you.

01:14:42.253 --> 01:14:44.187
They violated your privacy.

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:45.423
How does it feel?

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.393
Sarah.

01:14:49.395 --> 01:14:50.294
Hi.

01:14:50.296 --> 01:14:51.394
No.

01:14:51.396 --> 01:14:52.929
No, no, no, no.

01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:55.799
Darling, no that was
not me, that was,

01:14:55.801 --> 01:14:56.767
no, no, honey, that was not me.

01:14:56.769 --> 01:14:58.501
Listen, listen to me,
you gotta listen to me,

01:14:58.503 --> 01:15:00.070
listen, they've
kidnapped Elizabeth...

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:13.349
Brenda!

01:15:13.351 --> 01:15:14.916
Another thing you
didn't bother to check.

01:15:14.918 --> 01:15:16.486
Sarah picked up
Elizabeth hours ago.

01:15:16.488 --> 01:15:19.054
She's been asleep in her bed.

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:20.923
You bitch.

01:15:20.925 --> 01:15:22.357
This is a conspiracy!

01:15:22.359 --> 01:15:23.526
You falsified that video.

01:15:23.528 --> 01:15:27.129
What did you do to convict
the innocent Walter Smith?

01:15:27.131 --> 01:15:28.263
So?

01:15:28.265 --> 01:15:30.264
I suffered for the greater
good of decency, Frank,

01:15:30.266 --> 01:15:33.268
for the new NSA, but then,
it was strictly business.

01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:35.071
I'm sure you understand.

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:36.505
What's that sound?

01:15:36.507 --> 01:15:37.839
That's the people.

01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:39.141
They wanna talk to you.

01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:40.474
They'll never get
through security.

01:15:40.476 --> 01:15:42.210
You mean security
you were about to fire?

01:15:42.212 --> 01:15:43.911
I wouldn't had and
did it for you.

01:15:43.913 --> 01:15:45.914
Goodbye, Frank.

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:49.116
Wait, where are you going?

01:15:49.118 --> 01:15:50.885
What am I supposed to do now?

01:15:50.887 --> 01:15:52.889
Welcome
to the Snowden Club.
