 about the American Dream,

 it changed a little bit --

16:35.115 --> 16:36.876
Pops.

16:36.876 --> 16:39.249
I've never looked down
on you.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.960
I've been grateful
for everything

16:40.960 --> 16:42.542
that you've ever given me,

16:42.542 --> 16:45.295
but your life isn't the life
that I see for my son.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.628
Yeah, well, your life

16:48.628 --> 16:50.800
damn sure ain't the life
I saw for my son either.

16:54.554 --> 16:57.937
A grown man dressing up dogs
for a living?

16:57.937 --> 17:00.640
How's that
supposed to make sense?

17:00.640 --> 17:02.482
It makes sense!

17:02.482 --> 17:06.106
Nobody wants to buy insurance
from a naked dog!

17:06.106 --> 17:08.027
The numbers show that!

17:10.990 --> 17:14.864
[ Ruby chanting ]

17:14.864 --> 17:16.826
Are you hearing
what I'm hearing?

17:16.826 --> 17:20.039
[ Chanting continues ]

17:20.039 --> 17:21.501
Devil, come out!

17:21.501 --> 17:22.962
Ow!
 Grandma!

17:22.962 --> 17:24.584
What? What?!

17:24.584 --> 17:25.545
What?!

17:25.545 --> 17:27.217
Diane's
not possessed!

17:27.217 --> 17:29.089
We were just messing
with you.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.510
Wait a minute.
What?

17:30.510 --> 17:32.302
She didn't really kill
a bird.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.384
"I will let in
the light of the Lord."

17:34.384 --> 17:36.636
"I will let in
the light..."
 Oh!

17:36.636 --> 17:38.938
And Diane didn't make
the candles go out.

17:38.938 --> 17:40.310
They were
remote-controlled.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.271
Snack time!

17:41.271 --> 17:41.981
Coming.

17:41.981 --> 17:42.942
[ Beeps ]

17:42.942 --> 17:44.604
[ Wind gusts ]

17:46.396 --> 17:48.568
And I had dry ice
in my mouth.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.321
I can no longer taste salt,
but it was worth it.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.532
How do you explain
the video?

17:52.532 --> 17:55.615
That was just a coincidence.
Diane sleepwalks.

17:55.615 --> 17:57.197
I always find her
in my room

17:57.197 --> 17:58.748
when I wake up
from my night terrors.

18:00.039 --> 18:02.872
Why does no child in this family
sleep soundly?

18:02.872 --> 18:04.584
All right, very good.

18:04.584 --> 18:08.338
You all had a nice laugh
at my need to expel Satan.

18:08.338 --> 18:12.672
But I still don't understand
how you did this.

18:17.056 --> 18:18.388
I didn't do that.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.059
Zoey: Me, either.

18:25.525 --> 18:26.436
[ Light shatters ]

18:26.436 --> 18:28.988
[ All screaming ]

18:32.322 --> 18:35.235
Come on.
Latin is so easy.

18:35.235 --> 18:36.236
Agricola.

18:36.236 --> 18:37.697
Farmer.

18:37.697 --> 18:40.119
Agricola.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.741
[ Sighs ]
Can I just have a spanking?

18:41.741 --> 18:44.123
What?! No.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
Jack, come on.
Latin is not punishment.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.747
If you learn Latin,

18:47.747 --> 18:50.170
it'll help you become
any kind of doctor you wanna be.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.212
What if I wanna be
Dr Pepper?

18:52.212 --> 18:53.713
Okay.
You know what?

18:53.713 --> 18:55.965
This seems like
a natural stopping point.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.557
Thanks!

18:57.557 --> 18:59.759
Before you go though,
  agricola.
 Thanks!

19:01.391 --> 19:04.524
Bow, is there something wrong
with me?

19:04.524 --> 19:06.266
[ Laughing ]
Oh, come on, Dre.

19:06.266 --> 19:07.607
You're throwing
softballs, baby.

19:07.607 --> 19:09.359
[ Sighs ]

19:09.359 --> 19:12.482
Am I crazy because I don't
want Jack to be a plumber?
 Oh.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.654
It's not my fault
society looks down on people

19:14.654 --> 19:16.616
with blue collar jobs.
Hell, I didn't make the rules.

19:16.616 --> 19:17.827
No, I get it.
I do.

19:17.827 --> 19:19.369
It's part of the reason
I became a doctor.

19:19.369 --> 19:21.831
Seriously, being a doctor
is bulletproof.

19:21.831 --> 19:23.583
You can call me
what you want,

19:23.583 --> 19:25.495
but you gotta put
"doctor" first.

19:25.495 --> 19:26.956
Yeah.

19:26.956 --> 19:30.630
If I weren't an SVP, I'd just be
a black guy in the office.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.212
You know,
without these titles,

19:32.212 --> 19:34.053
you walk out into the world
as a black man

19:34.053 --> 19:35.505
and people
look down on you.

19:35.505 --> 19:37.507
And I don't want anybody
looking down on my son.

19:37.507 --> 19:39.969
I agree. [ Sighs ]
I do...

19:39.969 --> 19:42.061
with everything
except for the part

19:42.061 --> 19:44.394
where you equate what you do
with what I do.

19:44.394 --> 19:49.188
This is why people really,
really worry about us.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.270
Oh, no one's worried.

19:50.270 --> 19:51.271
It's because of you.

19:51.271 --> 19:52.272
Oh, me?
 Yes.

19:52.272 --> 19:53.693
It's me?
 Oh, very much so.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.575
Ohhh.
 Yes, you, Dr. Johnson.

19:55.575 --> 19:56.866
Oh, thank you so much.

Aw. Look at him.

Oh, Dre.

20:01.371 --> 20:02.532
Hm?

20:02.532 --> 20:05.084
This is our baggage,
not the kids'.

20:05.084 --> 20:07.287
I mean, you know,
when I think about it,

20:07.287 --> 20:08.998
our parents didn't even care
if we were happy

20:08.998 --> 20:11.130
'cause they were so busy trying
to make sure that we survived.

20:11.130 --> 20:13.172
-Mm-hmm.
-And now we're in a place

20:13.172 --> 20:16.256
where we get to focus
on raising happy kids

20:16.256 --> 20:19.048
who can be whatever
they wanna be.

20:19.048 --> 20:21.220
And that's how I figured out

20:21.220 --> 20:24.344
I needed to let Jack live
 his own American Dream.

20:24.344 --> 20:25.935
Who knows?

20:25.935 --> 20:28.898
Maybe he'll turn out to be
 a wildly successful mogul

20:28.898 --> 20:32.061
who gives all the credit to
 his wise and handsome father.

20:33.653 --> 20:35.405
Or not.

20:35.405 --> 20:39.198
All that matters is that he
 keeps that smile on his face.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.490
And I'm not gonna be mad
 at that.

20:45.164 --> 20:46.536
Can't believe you are actually
interested in my work.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.918
I said I'd come.
I never said I was interested.

20:48.918 --> 20:50.460
Oh. Hey, guys.

to my dad, Earl Johnson.

Wow.
Dre, this is exciting.

I had no idea that you knew
your father.

21:04.434 --> 21:06.055
statistically speaking,
close to zero.

21:06.055 --> 21:08.267
Hey. I really wish
we could chat,

21:08.267 --> 21:11.060

at the country club.

but I'd love to.

'til right now.
 Hm.
