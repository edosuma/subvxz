WEBVTT

00:07.002 --> 00:08.012
There you go.

00:08.014 --> 00:09.011
Enjoy.

00:21.004 --> 00:22.007
This is
from Red Hood!

00:33.010 --> 00:34.006
Hey!

00:35.005 --> 00:36.004
Get off him!

00:37.006 --> 00:38.012
This isn't over!

00:38.014 --> 00:39.019
Red Hood wants you!

00:39.021 --> 00:43.004
He'll get you!

00:45.019 --> 00:46.020
He'll get you!

01:11.001 --> 01:12.004
Take a break.

01:13.018 --> 01:15.012
You've been cleaning for hours.

01:16.005 --> 01:17.006
Eat something.

01:19.001 --> 01:20.000
Can't eat.

01:21.009 --> 01:22.007
I failed.

01:24.018 --> 01:26.009
Superman never would've failed.

01:26.011 --> 01:28.008
Don't think like that. We...

01:29.016 --> 01:30.022
we did the best we could.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.016
Then why isn't
Hank still alive?

01:32.018 --> 01:33.019
Conner, I know this is hard.

01:33.021 --> 01:36.008
How about stop the bullshit?

01:36.010 --> 01:37.013
Just come out and say it.

01:39.005 --> 01:41.008
If I wasn't
a fucked-up half breed,

01:42.011 --> 01:43.008
none of this would've happened.

01:43.010 --> 01:44.017
Don't say that word.

01:44.019 --> 01:47.016
I'm talking
about the Lex part of me.

01:47.018 --> 01:51.020
It's like everyone was waiting
for him to take over.

01:51.022 --> 01:54.015
So, you can all do
your happy dance now

01:54.017 --> 01:58.015
because Superboy definitely
did not save the day.

02:00.019 --> 02:02.018
Don't do this to yourself.

02:02.020 --> 02:04.004
Great.

02:04.006 --> 02:07.017
Advice from
a talking green tiger. Thanks.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.019
You're right.

02:11.019 --> 02:13.003
You're not Superman.

02:17.018 --> 02:18.015
Sorry.

02:19.023 --> 02:21.006
I didn't mean to interrupt.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.019
It's okay.

02:28.021 --> 02:29.017
Hey.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.017
It's not your fault.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.006
I pulled the trigger.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.008
That's not on you.

02:39.008 --> 02:41.022
But it was our job to save him.

02:42.018 --> 02:44.005
It was our job to try.

02:47.002 --> 02:48.015
And we did.

02:55.004 --> 02:56.021
I want him back, too.

03:09.021 --> 03:10.018
Paris?

03:11.018 --> 03:12.022
For now.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.015
I'll hole up
in my family's place.

03:15.017 --> 03:17.018
See what the world looks like
without Dove.

03:20.004 --> 03:21.018
I liked how it looked before.

03:24.012 --> 03:26.012
I worry about where
your mind is going.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.023
Jason has to be stopped.

03:31.001 --> 03:32.011
How he's stopped matters.

03:32.013 --> 03:34.003
Not with Hank dead.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.011
Deathstroke damaged us all,

03:35.013 --> 03:36.021
but none of us turned
into a killer.

03:39.013 --> 03:40.022
Speak for yourself.

03:46.007 --> 03:49.007
I keep thinking about the time
I told you not to be Batman.

03:50.018 --> 03:53.011
I knew what Gotham could
do to a person.

03:53.013 --> 03:56.006
Bruce was on to something
when he walked away from this.

03:57.017 --> 03:59.002
Hank wanted to stop, too.

04:03.014 --> 04:05.015
I know in my heart
there's a way out.

04:08.001 --> 04:10.001
There's something more
on the other side.

04:12.003 --> 04:13.019
You could always come with me.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.012
You know I hate flying.

04:22.016 --> 04:23.012
Love you.

04:25.011 --> 04:26.014
I love you, too.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.004
Always.

04:35.014 --> 04:37.016
Okay.

04:49.008 --> 04:50.014
Yeah.

04:50.016 --> 04:52.000
<i>How are
you holding up?</i>

04:53.005 --> 04:54.010
I'm at the hangar.

04:56.008 --> 04:57.009
How is she?

04:58.017 --> 04:59.019
She's on a plane.

04:59.021 --> 05:00.018
Any leads?

05:02.003 --> 05:03.017
<i>Red Hood put out a hit
on Jonathan Crane</i>

05:03.019 --> 05:05.001
<i>in Arkham this morning.</i>

05:06.007 --> 05:08.003
-What?
-They tried to shank him.

05:08.005 --> 05:11.019
Details are still sketchy,
but it looks to be retaliation.

05:11.021 --> 05:13.009
Maybe 'cause he was
helping you.

05:13.011 --> 05:15.001
-And Crane?
<i>-Just wounded.</i>

05:15.003 --> 05:17.009
<i>We're moving him
to a secure location.</i>

05:17.011 --> 05:18.014
Blackgate.

05:18.016 --> 05:20.009
<i>He'll be safe there.</i>

05:20.011 --> 05:22.021
-He survived a Red Hood attack?
<i>-Got lucky.</i>

05:22.023 --> 05:25.006
We're investigating
who Red Hood has on the inside.

05:25.008 --> 05:27.007
-When are you moving him?
<i>-Within the hour.</i>

05:27.009 --> 05:28.017
<i>Just waiting on B.O.P.</i>

05:29.015 --> 05:30.016
Hey.

05:31.015 --> 05:33.011
I'm really sorry about Hank.

05:34.017 --> 05:37.000
Maybe you should
take a few days.

05:37.002 --> 05:39.002
Take it easy. Process it all.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.005
<i>Good idea.</i>

05:41.007 --> 05:42.006
<i>Take care.</i>

05:58.000 --> 05:59.014
Hey, what's up, Kory?

05:59.016 --> 06:01.005
I made a pizza. You want some?

06:01.007 --> 06:03.000
I should be getting paid
an hourly rate

06:03.002 --> 06:04.017
for how much house work
I'm doing.

06:04.019 --> 06:07.002
Not to mention
the crisis counseling.

06:07.004 --> 06:08.011
Where is Alfred
when you need him?

06:12.020 --> 06:14.007
Sorry. Bad joke.

06:18.005 --> 06:19.014
Kory, stop!

06:23.012 --> 06:25.000
What the shit!

06:38.001 --> 06:39.019
Gar, what happened?

06:39.021 --> 06:41.005
Stay away from me.

06:42.019 --> 06:43.015
Gar?

06:44.008 --> 06:45.008
What?

06:47.009 --> 06:48.006
Shit.

06:49.014 --> 06:51.006
Fuck!

06:51.008 --> 06:52.023
The Bureau
of Prisons is placing Crane

06:53.001 --> 06:55.002
in a high-security facility.

06:55.004 --> 06:56.019
I'd be careful
he doesn't get out.

06:56.021 --> 06:58.016
It took Batman
to bring him in last time.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.022
Yeah, I heard he blew town.

07:01.015 --> 07:02.021
We'll be okay.

07:02.023 --> 07:05.013
Gotham PD can handle
anything thrown at it.

07:05.015 --> 07:06.022
I admire the courage.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.010
I got a good GI doc
if the ulcers kick in.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.021
All this time,
I thought that's what

07:10.023 --> 07:12.013
-the bourbon was for.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.013
Spoken like Jim Gordon himself.

07:14.015 --> 07:16.006
My father was a Scotch man.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.007
We'll be
in touch, Commissioner.

07:26.006 --> 07:28.001
-Pick up.

07:33.005 --> 07:34.016
Don't tell me.

07:34.018 --> 07:37.000
You are at the airport
and you want me to pick you up,

07:37.002 --> 07:39.014
and whisk you away
to the finest
dining establishment

07:39.016 --> 07:41.002
San Francisco has to offer.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.011
I think I'm losing my mind.

07:45.019 --> 07:47.000
Talk to me.

07:47.002 --> 07:49.004
<i>I didn't know who else to call.</i>

07:49.006 --> 07:51.013
-I'm scared.
<i>-Hey.</i>

07:51.015 --> 07:52.016
It's okay. I'm here for you.

07:52.018 --> 07:54.016
Just tell me what happened.

07:54.018 --> 07:56.002
<i>I had another dream.</i>

07:57.019 --> 08:00.007
I was sleepwalking,
but I lost control.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.020
<i>I could have killed him.</i>

08:03.022 --> 08:05.010
Whoa. Killed who?

08:06.011 --> 08:07.013
It doesn't matter.

08:07.015 --> 08:09.014
Do you hear me?

08:09.016 --> 08:12.004
People in my life are
getting hurt.

08:13.022 --> 08:15.001
They're dying.

08:16.005 --> 08:18.003
And now I'm hurting them, too.

08:20.014 --> 08:22.014
<i>I just feel so out of control.</i>

08:23.008 --> 08:24.021
I hear you.

08:24.023 --> 08:27.014
And you did the right thing,
asking for help.

08:27.016 --> 08:29.023
I feel so ashamed.

08:30.001 --> 08:32.019
I'm supposed to be the one
people turn to for help.

08:32.021 --> 08:33.023
Because you're a Titan.

08:35.004 --> 08:36.004
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:36.006 --> 08:38.010
Well, you're also human.

08:38.012 --> 08:40.006
The grief you feel, the fear...

08:41.011 --> 08:43.000
it's just part of being one.

08:43.002 --> 08:45.017
That's just it.
I'm not... human.

08:48.013 --> 08:51.022
You know what, Dr. Cole,
I'm sorry I called you.

09:03.019 --> 09:06.001
-Stay back.
-Gar, it's okay.

09:06.021 --> 09:08.006
I'm so sorry.

09:10.003 --> 09:11.010
Are you okay?

09:11.012 --> 09:13.020
Am I okay? Yeah, I'm great.

09:13.022 --> 09:16.009
Perfect. Seared medium rare.
What happened?

09:16.011 --> 09:18.013
I had another one
of those dreams.

09:19.018 --> 09:21.002
Visions. Whatever they are,

09:21.004 --> 09:22.020
they're coming
more frequently now.

09:23.023 --> 09:25.006
Hey, what kind of visions?

09:26.006 --> 09:27.019
I don't know. It's like I'm me,

09:27.021 --> 09:29.004
but I'm someone else, too,

09:29.006 --> 09:31.011
watching me from the outside.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.014
They're pulling me somewhere,
but I don't know where.

09:35.016 --> 09:37.012
Rachel had visions, too,
you know?

09:39.001 --> 09:40.010
When she learned
to embrace them,

09:40.012 --> 09:42.003
then she could figure out
what they were about.

09:42.005 --> 09:43.013
How am I supposed to do that?

09:45.016 --> 09:47.004
They come out of nowhere.

09:50.018 --> 09:52.013
What?

09:52.015 --> 09:54.023
Stop. You mean
I'm supposed to follow you?

09:59.022 --> 10:01.019
It's a
sensory deprivation tank.

10:01.021 --> 10:03.014
Dick said Batman used it
for meditation.

10:03.016 --> 10:05.008
It's supposed
to help you block out

10:05.010 --> 10:07.013
the outside world,
and get super focused.

10:09.006 --> 10:10.016
Are you putting me in time-out?

10:10.018 --> 10:12.008
Look, it's supposed to work.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.020
It's made
out of reinforced steel

10:13.022 --> 10:15.000
and depleted promethium,

10:15.002 --> 10:16.016
so it's
basically indestructible.

10:16.018 --> 10:18.022
So, you can use it
without hurting anyone.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.003
Especially me.

11:08.011 --> 11:09.018
How quaint.

11:09.020 --> 11:11.008
Real government men.

11:11.010 --> 11:12.023
You boys do taxes, too?

11:13.001 --> 11:15.013
I need some help with my I-9.

11:15.015 --> 11:17.012
I'm sure they got TurboTax
at Blackgate.

11:17.014 --> 11:19.018
Blackgate? I though we were
going to a day spa.

11:23.009 --> 11:25.014
-Get in there!
-Hey, easy.

11:32.008 --> 11:33.021
You guys got
that paperwork set to...

11:39.009 --> 11:40.007
The fuck?

11:57.015 --> 11:58.016
Let's go.

12:14.012 --> 12:16.020
I'm an Alfa man myself.

12:16.022 --> 12:20.010
Those Italians,
those lines, that flair...

12:21.003 --> 12:22.009
the <i>sprezzatura.</i>

12:25.004 --> 12:26.014
It's a term.

12:26.016 --> 12:27.019
It means the art of making

12:27.021 --> 12:29.018
something complicated
look easy.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.012
Like that trail of bodies
you left back there.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.010
You didn't even
break a sweat, did you?

12:37.003 --> 12:38.012
Like an old pro.

12:38.014 --> 12:40.016
See, now that is <i>sprezzatura.</i>

12:44.007 --> 12:46.004
Look, I don't need to worry
about that piece

12:46.006 --> 12:49.001
you nicked from the B.O.P.
back there, do I?

12:49.003 --> 12:50.016
I mean, you wouldn't
shoot a bound

12:50.018 --> 12:52.012
and defenseless man now,
would you?

12:54.016 --> 12:55.012
Depends.

13:38.023 --> 13:39.019
Hello?

13:39.021 --> 13:41.019
Let me out of here!

13:42.011 --> 13:43.019
Who is "me"?

13:43.021 --> 13:44.020
Gar!

13:44.022 --> 13:45.023
Gar.

13:50.012 --> 13:51.023
Oh, my God!

13:52.001 --> 13:54.001
What the hell is going on?

13:54.003 --> 13:56.009
I try to help you,
and this is the thanks I get?

13:56.011 --> 13:59.006
You knock me out, throw me
in the back of a trunk, and...

13:59.008 --> 14:02.022
drive me out to...
where the hell even is this?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.001
-That was me?
-Yeah.

14:05.003 --> 14:06.009
You went into a trance,

14:06.011 --> 14:08.002
broke out
of the isolation chamber,

14:08.004 --> 14:10.011
and when I tried to stop you,
you punched me in the face.

14:10.013 --> 14:12.002
That's bad.

14:12.004 --> 14:13.018
-That's really bad.
-Yup.

14:13.020 --> 14:17.010
And I'm through being nice
and taking care of all of you.

14:17.012 --> 14:19.021
You, Conner,
and everybody else sucks!

14:20.012 --> 14:21.011
You suck!

14:22.020 --> 14:24.017
Gar.

14:29.022 --> 14:31.004
You drove out here asleep?

14:33.013 --> 14:34.022
Where are we?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.017
I don't know.

14:36.019 --> 14:39.015
I just woke up
and I was parked here.

14:39.017 --> 14:41.014
What did you see this time
in your vision?

14:45.005 --> 14:46.005
Blackfire.

14:47.005 --> 14:48.011
-Your sister.
-Mm.

14:49.005 --> 14:50.008
The crazy one...

14:51.005 --> 14:52.019
that killed your parents?

14:52.021 --> 14:54.007
Her.

14:54.009 --> 14:57.001
I don't know. It feels
like I'm supposed to be here.

14:57.003 --> 14:59.011
Like she brought me here.

14:59.013 --> 15:01.002
She brought you
to the middle of nowhere?

15:08.005 --> 15:09.006
The car.

15:11.005 --> 15:12.005
Move it.

15:13.016 --> 15:14.017
Keep going.

15:16.005 --> 15:17.002
That's good.

15:20.015 --> 15:23.018
What is it?
-A hatch.

15:23.020 --> 15:26.010
Whatever your psychic GPS was
leading you to...

15:29.019 --> 15:31.000
it's down here.

15:31.002 --> 15:32.013
My sister is down that hole?

15:32.015 --> 15:35.014
Eh, she might be,
among many other things.

15:35.016 --> 15:37.016
-Only one way to find out.
-Okay. Ha, yes.

15:37.018 --> 15:38.020
Common Sense committee.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.001
Let's talk this out.

15:40.003 --> 15:41.014
The last time
you saw your sister,

15:41.016 --> 15:43.016
-she cooked
your boyfriend. Right?
-Mm.

15:43.018 --> 15:46.005
Either I find out
what's down that hatch,

15:46.007 --> 15:48.023
or I keep sleepwalking
and punching you in the face.

15:49.018 --> 15:50.014
Your choice.

15:53.015 --> 15:55.022
This Grayson,
he's one of yours?

15:56.015 --> 15:57.012
Not exactly.

15:59.017 --> 16:00.018
That's an answer?

16:00.020 --> 16:02.014
He used to be Detroit PD.

16:02.016 --> 16:04.002
Then he went to SF.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.008
And he just moved back to town.

16:05.010 --> 16:07.007
So he's a friend?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.019
Yes. Grayson was
using Crane as a consultant

16:09.021 --> 16:11.006
on this new Red Hood case.

16:11.008 --> 16:13.013
He lost a colleague
to Red Hood last night.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.017
I'm guessing this is
an emotional reaction.

16:15.019 --> 16:17.022
He just wants to talk to Crane
and then he'll let him go.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.011
So you're gonna talk him
into surrendering the prisoner?

16:20.013 --> 16:21.021
Absolutely.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.022
Out of respect for your father,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.005
and because you took on
a shitty job no one else would,

16:26.007 --> 16:29.001
you have
until midnight to fix this.

16:29.003 --> 16:30.013
And then it's a B.O.P. matter.

16:31.019 --> 16:32.019
We'll track him down.

16:39.003 --> 16:42.006
More CCTV footage.
This time from the city limits.

16:42.008 --> 16:44.018
Looks like Grayson's still
on the move with Crane.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.002
-Hello?
<i>Where are you, Dick?</i>

16:51.000 --> 16:52.004
Change of plans.

16:52.006 --> 16:54.005
Bring Crane back.

16:54.007 --> 16:57.000
-I will.
-I'd get that in writing
if I were you.

16:57.002 --> 16:58.008
Is that him listening?

16:58.010 --> 17:00.020
-Yo, Babs.
<i>-Jesus, Dick.</i>

17:00.022 --> 17:02.014
I need Crane back here

17:02.016 --> 17:03.020
<i>right now.</i>

17:06.000 --> 17:07.001
Gotta go.

17:10.005 --> 17:12.002
Put out an APB
on a black Maserati.

17:12.004 --> 17:13.009
I wanna know where
he's heading,

17:13.011 --> 17:15.001
'cause it sure as shit
isn't Blackgate.

17:17.005 --> 17:19.017
I overheard the police talking
about what happened...

17:20.012 --> 17:21.019
to that Hawk fellow.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.011
Red Hood is a monster.

17:31.013 --> 17:33.003
We've both got
proof of that now.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.010
But I can still help you.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.005
You know, just let me know
what I can do.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.011
You can shut up.

17:42.001 --> 17:43.017
Enjoy the <i>sprezzatura.</i>

17:57.010 --> 17:59.005
Watch your back.

17:59.007 --> 18:01.004
Blackfire probably knows
we're here.

18:02.003 --> 18:04.001
Feel free to watch mine, too.

18:24.022 --> 18:26.008
-You all right?
-Yeah.

18:26.010 --> 18:28.010
Just keep moving.

18:34.004 --> 18:35.006
What is it?

18:35.008 --> 18:36.009
This doorway,

18:37.009 --> 18:39.014
I've seen it in my dreams.

18:39.016 --> 18:41.000
We're in the right place.

18:58.010 --> 18:59.019
Oh, my God.

19:04.011 --> 19:05.015
Oh, snap.

19:05.017 --> 19:09.014
I knew
I was right. I knew it.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.010
You just... you have
these theories.

19:12.012 --> 19:14.001
You talk to yourself
in the mirror

19:14.003 --> 19:15.005
to convince yourself

19:15.007 --> 19:17.000
you're not cuckoo
Cocoa Puffs crazy.

19:17.002 --> 19:19.000
You know,
because there's no one...

19:19.002 --> 19:20.014
There's no really down here
to talk to.

19:20.016 --> 19:22.017
I mean, in a meaningful,
connected way.

19:22.019 --> 19:26.005
Oh, but then--
just like magic,

19:26.007 --> 19:28.003
here you are.

19:29.013 --> 19:31.019
Sorry, I...

19:31.021 --> 19:34.001
I got lost there
for a moment. Uh...

19:34.003 --> 19:36.017
You two probably have
some questions. Yeah?

19:59.016 --> 20:01.000
Let me go.

20:02.015 --> 20:03.016
Not gonna happen.

20:48.008 --> 20:49.007
Are you done now?

21:00.004 --> 21:02.012
Ah, is this where you
carve up the victims?

21:04.006 --> 21:05.008
Just keep walking.

21:24.020 --> 21:26.019
It's not what you think it is.

21:26.021 --> 21:29.000
Look, I had nothing to do
with what happened
to your friend.

21:29.002 --> 21:30.006
What's his name, Hawk?

21:31.010 --> 21:32.019
You don't get
to talk about him.

21:34.021 --> 21:36.021
It was Red Hood who did it.
The kid's a monster.

21:36.023 --> 21:39.015
Bullshit! You were the one
that made Jason into a monster.

21:42.015 --> 21:45.003
The attack at Arkham
was a phony. It wasn't a hit.

21:45.005 --> 21:47.015
It was just an excuse to get
your ass out of Blackgate.

21:48.019 --> 21:50.001
Red Hood's your protege.

21:50.003 --> 21:51.018
And I know he's coming here
to save you.

21:55.020 --> 21:57.005
You may be overestimating him.

21:57.007 --> 21:58.017
He'll come.
He knows this place.

21:59.019 --> 22:00.022
Bruce took him here too.

22:03.001 --> 22:03.023
It's where he trained us.

22:08.023 --> 22:11.010
We'll see him coming
a mile away.

22:11.012 --> 22:14.001
So why would he
walk into a trap?

22:14.003 --> 22:16.002
Because he can't help himself.

22:16.004 --> 22:17.015
Because you
made him feel invincible.

22:17.017 --> 22:19.000
You think I changed him?

22:19.002 --> 22:21.020
Oh, buddy, no.
I got news for you.

22:21.022 --> 22:23.010
That kid
came to me broken. Okay?

22:23.012 --> 22:25.012
All I did was rebuild him.
And it was easy, too,

22:25.014 --> 22:27.020
after what you did to him
in SF.

22:27.022 --> 22:30.005
And that Titans business,

22:30.007 --> 22:32.015
what a twisted mind-fuck.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.002
I kind of wish I'd actually
thought of that myself.

22:35.004 --> 22:37.000
It's not true.
-Isn't it?

22:38.013 --> 22:40.023
Isn't that what you do
to all the young people

22:41.001 --> 22:43.023
that you fail? Abandon them.

22:44.001 --> 22:46.002
Or kill them.

22:46.004 --> 22:48.002
How is that little witch girl,
by the way?

22:49.010 --> 22:50.012
Or the mute boy.

22:51.020 --> 22:52.016
Oh.

22:55.009 --> 22:58.011
You must be so sorry
about all of that now.

23:03.001 --> 23:03.023
Time to eat.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.015
So why is my sister here?

23:10.017 --> 23:12.016
Well, 'cause we're
a Defense Department contractor

23:12.018 --> 23:14.017
tasked with extraterrestrial
threat assessment

23:14.019 --> 23:17.000
and executing
containment strategies
as needed.

23:17.002 --> 23:18.012
Containment strategies?

23:18.014 --> 23:21.007
Well, Blackfire was a hostile,
so we shut her down.

23:21.009 --> 23:23.000
The red infrared light,
the cold air,

23:23.002 --> 23:25.007
the metallic chromium
inside the holding area walls,

23:25.009 --> 23:28.004
these are all methods
of tamping down
Blackfire's energy.

23:28.006 --> 23:30.005
I don't understand.
Are her powers gone?

23:30.007 --> 23:32.023
Well, mostly.
But her brain scan still showed

23:33.001 --> 23:35.021
that she still possesses
extra-sensory perception.

23:35.023 --> 23:37.022
So, it appears
that she was able

23:38.000 --> 23:40.012
to psychically communicate
her whereabouts to you,

23:40.014 --> 23:42.017
the only other Tamaranean
on Earth.

23:42.019 --> 23:45.012
So, your organization
goes around imprisoning

23:45.014 --> 23:48.015
and experimenting on aliens
that just happen to land
on Earth?

23:48.017 --> 23:50.001
Oh. No, no. Uh...

23:50.003 --> 23:51.014
Are you gonna lock me up too?

23:51.016 --> 23:54.015
No, no, no, no, no,
no, of course not.

23:54.017 --> 23:58.023
Uh, I'm a solitary remote op,
you know,

23:59.001 --> 24:00.019
with one inmate, so,

24:00.021 --> 24:01.023
even if I want to...

24:04.001 --> 24:06.000
I wouldn't do that.

24:06.002 --> 24:10.000
Uh, I am a huge fan
of yours, Starfire.

24:10.002 --> 24:11.018
You're amazing.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.005
And you too, Beast Boy.

24:15.012 --> 24:18.006
-Thanks.
-I need to talk to my sister.

24:18.008 --> 24:20.012
Oh, okay, uh...

24:20.014 --> 24:21.020
Coffee's almost ready.

24:34.013 --> 24:35.010
Komand'r.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Koriand'r.

24:48.015 --> 24:49.015
You came.

24:57.014 --> 24:59.023
-You must be happy.
-Do I look like I'm happy?

25:00.001 --> 25:02.011
If you didn't come
to laugh at me,
then why are you here?

25:02.013 --> 25:04.005
You called me here.

25:04.007 --> 25:07.002
I didn't think you
could still hear me.

25:07.004 --> 25:11.010
It's been a while since I heard
your voice so clearly
in my head.

25:11.012 --> 25:13.006
-Not since we were--
-Children.

25:13.008 --> 25:15.001
Well, now that you're here,

25:15.003 --> 25:17.016
if you have any shred
of mercy left in you,

25:17.018 --> 25:19.004
you'll put me out of my misery.

25:20.001 --> 25:21.013
You want me to kill you?

25:21.015 --> 25:24.019
Being a prisoner
on this backwater planet
is a dishonor.

25:24.021 --> 25:27.018
-I would rather die than--
-Maybe you should.

25:27.020 --> 25:30.013
As payment
for all the lives you've taken.

25:30.015 --> 25:34.004
For Mother, and Father.
For Faddei.

25:34.006 --> 25:35.017
You killed Faddei.

25:35.019 --> 25:38.022
And didn't you come to Earth
to kill a child, Starfire?

25:42.008 --> 25:44.001
<i>Things were
different then.</i>

25:44.003 --> 25:46.002
-I was different.
-That's right.

25:46.004 --> 25:48.006
You used to believe
in Tamaranean law,

25:48.008 --> 25:50.019
all the things we learned
from Mother and Father.

25:50.021 --> 25:52.007
But you turned your back
on them.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.010
I didn't kill them.

25:54.021 --> 25:56.021
Things aren't always
what they seem, Koriand'r.

25:56.023 --> 25:59.013
What the hell
is that even supposed to mean?

25:59.015 --> 26:00.023
You haven't changed a bit.

26:01.001 --> 26:02.019
You are just as broken
as you've ever been.

26:02.021 --> 26:04.006
Just like when we were kids.

26:04.008 --> 26:06.000
And I suppose that has
nothing to do with you?

26:06.002 --> 26:07.000
Of course not.

26:07.021 --> 26:09.006
You made your choices.

26:11.005 --> 26:12.011
-The Pit.

26:12.013 --> 26:14.008
-X'Hal's Mouth.
-It was a pit.

26:16.002 --> 26:17.014
A prison for a child.

26:17.016 --> 26:19.000
You remember.

26:19.002 --> 26:22.005
"Girls, one of Father's
trophies is missing."

26:22.007 --> 26:25.000
"Girls, someone left
the stables open."

26:25.002 --> 26:27.010
Mm-hmm. So what?
We were kids, we played pranks.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.020
We were punished.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.012
You always fought back,
that's why they were
harder on you.

26:31.014 --> 26:32.019
You brought it onto yourself.

26:32.021 --> 26:35.004
You were never punished
like I was.

26:35.006 --> 26:36.012
Tamaran's favorite princess.

26:36.014 --> 26:38.000
I didn't put you in the Pit.

26:38.002 --> 26:39.020
You never stood up for me.

26:41.018 --> 26:43.017
I am your sister.

26:45.013 --> 26:46.022
You hurt people.

26:49.002 --> 26:50.021
You deserve to be in here.

26:52.002 --> 26:53.006
I knew you'd say that.

26:57.002 --> 27:00.002
<i>You pretend to be above it all.</i>

27:00.004 --> 27:01.020
<i>But you love getting even.</i>

27:03.008 --> 27:04.010
Like with Faddei.

27:06.011 --> 27:09.006
He broke your heart
all those years ago, didn't he?

27:09.008 --> 27:12.008
I bet that so-called mercy kill
was easy for you.

27:14.022 --> 27:15.020
No. No, no, no, no.

27:15.022 --> 27:17.002
You need to do something

27:17.004 --> 27:19.001
or she's going
to blow up Blackfire.

27:19.003 --> 27:20.019
Don't worry, don't worry.
There's security provisions
in the cell,

27:20.021 --> 27:22.012
they've reduced
Starfire's power
to nearly zero.

28:00.020 --> 28:02.022
Do it, please.

28:10.023 --> 28:12.002
I hate you.

28:12.016 --> 28:13.016
I know.

28:15.016 --> 28:17.003
I'm gonna leave you in here,

28:18.001 --> 28:19.020
let justice run its course.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.006
Kind, open up.

28:35.018 --> 28:38.013
You're exactly what
I thought you always were.

28:38.015 --> 28:39.014
Disloyal.

28:40.013 --> 28:42.008
A hypocrite.

28:42.010 --> 28:45.022
I deserve the sister
who would fight for me.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.023
Everything I ever did was
because I never had that.

28:50.001 --> 28:52.017
I am who I am because of you...

28:53.017 --> 28:55.005
Koriand'r.

29:29.014 --> 29:30.019
So what's your plan here?

29:32.007 --> 29:35.010
I told you, wait for Red Hood
and take him out.

29:35.012 --> 29:37.004
No, I mean, I mean, in Gotham.

29:37.006 --> 29:39.006
You stepping into
Daddy's shoes?

29:39.008 --> 29:41.006
Now, don't get me wrong,
I mean, you know,

29:41.008 --> 29:42.016
we all want
to please our parents.

29:42.018 --> 29:44.012
That's why I became a doctor.

29:44.014 --> 29:48.000
You see how well
that worked out, right?

29:48.002 --> 29:50.005
You actually think
we're the same?

29:50.007 --> 29:51.011
No, no, no.

29:51.013 --> 29:53.003
What I'm saying is that
we all get stuck

29:53.005 --> 29:55.018
on this hamster wheel of...

29:55.020 --> 29:59.014
Trying to live up
to the expectations of others.

29:59.016 --> 30:02.001
And we always think that
it's gonna turn out different,

30:02.003 --> 30:05.014
but the outcome is somehow
always the same.

30:05.016 --> 30:07.003
And is that
what you told Jason?

30:08.018 --> 30:10.021
No, I'm talking about you.

30:10.023 --> 30:13.019
You come back here
and you wanna
bathe Gotham in blood

30:13.021 --> 30:16.002
as if that's somehow
a better outcome

30:16.004 --> 30:18.014
than anything
that Batman ever did.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.018
Bruce was a psychopath.

30:20.020 --> 30:23.007
He was using fear
to control everyone,

30:23.009 --> 30:24.020
including his sons.

30:24.022 --> 30:29.021
I mean, he did it to Jason,
and he did it to you.

30:29.023 --> 30:33.005
And you and Jason,
you both use that fear.

30:33.007 --> 30:35.009
You wield it like a weapon,

30:35.011 --> 30:39.000
but it hurts people, right?

30:39.002 --> 30:41.001
It hurts people
that you care about.

30:41.023 --> 30:42.022
Like Hawk.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.003
It's still Bruce's game,
isn't it?

30:48.002 --> 30:49.010
It always has been.

30:57.011 --> 30:59.002
Is there
something on your mind?

31:01.016 --> 31:02.023
"Fear is your friend."

31:05.006 --> 31:07.015
-What's that?
-Bruce used to say it.

31:08.022 --> 31:10.023
He said,
"Fear reveals your weakness...

31:12.022 --> 31:15.006
and it gives you the chance
to make it your strength."

31:15.021 --> 31:16.018
Hmm.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.011
And him being
the man that he is, he...

31:20.013 --> 31:23.018
needed to make sure
that you were afraid,
didn't he?

31:25.014 --> 31:27.007
I was out here all alone once.

31:30.018 --> 31:33.022
Bruce made me go out
into the forest by myself
for the first time.

31:37.019 --> 31:39.013
I had no idea
what was out there.

31:54.005 --> 31:55.013
You were just a boy,

31:55.015 --> 31:57.015
and those were the lessons
that he taught you.

32:01.008 --> 32:02.016
It's not your fault.

32:05.016 --> 32:06.020
But you need to make sure

32:06.022 --> 32:08.020
that this doesn't happen
to someone else.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.011
That it stops with you.

32:15.003 --> 32:18.006
Now you let Gotham take care
of Gotham.

32:18.008 --> 32:20.008
The water will find its level.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.002
Stop trying
to prove something here.

32:27.020 --> 32:29.007
<i>Motion detected.</i>

32:30.008 --> 32:31.019
<i>Perimeter breached.</i>

32:36.002 --> 32:38.007
But the thing about that is

32:38.009 --> 32:39.019
I've already proved myself.

32:42.016 --> 32:44.004
That night when I was a kid...

32:45.011 --> 32:47.003
-without Bruce.

33:21.003 --> 33:22.022
I shouldn't have been afraid
of the wolf.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.023
The wolf should have
been afraid of me.

33:32.020 --> 33:35.015
Now, let's get you
all fixed up.

33:36.008 --> 33:37.009
Company's coming

33:43.020 --> 33:45.022
You know, I can't say how much
of a privilege it's been

33:46.000 --> 33:47.010
to have you here, Starfire.

33:47.012 --> 33:49.019
And rest assured
that your sister will stay here

33:49.021 --> 33:53.022
until she is no longer a threat
to Tamaran, or to Earth.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.013
But you said
her powers are gone.

33:56.015 --> 33:57.020
Yeah, they are.

33:57.022 --> 34:00.002
Uh, if she were ever released,
I mean,

34:00.004 --> 34:03.016
there's just no guarantee
that her powers won't be
somehow restored.

34:03.018 --> 34:06.023
So you intend to keep her here
until she dies?

34:07.001 --> 34:08.007
Yeah, absolutely.

34:08.009 --> 34:09.023
But that could be
hundreds of years from now.

34:10.001 --> 34:11.015
Yes, well,
we've constructed her cell

34:11.017 --> 34:13.009
to make sure she
stays contained

34:13.011 --> 34:15.007
with or without our oversight.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.004
She's gonna be here
even after you guys are gone?

34:17.006 --> 34:19.007
Yes, Blackfire will
remain here,

34:19.009 --> 34:21.023
and the world will
be safe from her.

34:31.005 --> 34:33.021
Okay. Heat sensor data
came through.

34:36.004 --> 34:38.017
Crane was abducted here
at Arkham.

34:38.019 --> 34:41.013
Then the traffic camera
clocked the Maserati here,

34:41.015 --> 34:45.003
150 miles up the 34 highway
two hours later

34:45.005 --> 34:48.008
At first it looked like he was
headed towards Haddon's Mark,

34:48.010 --> 34:50.016
but then, this detour

34:50.018 --> 34:52.000
away from Blackgate.

34:52.002 --> 34:54.008
And we picked up
a heat marker here.

34:54.010 --> 34:57.009
But there is
nothing around there for miles.

34:59.019 --> 35:00.023
I need a helicopter.

35:03.017 --> 35:05.018
So this is
best-case scenario, right?

35:05.020 --> 35:08.004
Blackfire behind bars
for the rest of her life?

35:09.014 --> 35:10.023
Just like the Pit.

35:11.001 --> 35:11.021
What?

35:13.007 --> 35:15.021
Fuck.
I don't think so. Come on.

35:23.018 --> 35:24.023
Oh,
did you forget something?

35:25.001 --> 35:27.004
Yeah. Blackfire.

35:27.006 --> 35:29.000
What are you doing?

35:29.002 --> 35:30.005
She's coming with me.

35:30.007 --> 35:32.003
What?
You cannot take her.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.017
She is our sole detainee.

35:33.019 --> 35:35.013
Put a vacancy sign out front.
On your feet, let's go.

35:35.015 --> 35:37.006
What are you doing?
The right thing.

35:37.008 --> 35:38.015
Don't make me regret it.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.014
I'm sorry,
but I just... Please.

35:42.016 --> 35:44.015
You can't leave.

35:53.021 --> 35:55.021
Starfire, this is
an egregious violation

35:55.023 --> 35:58.009
of a number of statutes,
both federal and local.

35:58.011 --> 36:00.008
-Get out of our way.
I can't.

36:01.012 --> 36:03.014
Blackfire belongs
to the US Government.

36:07.020 --> 36:10.002
Get out of my way...

36:10.004 --> 36:11.022
or I'm gonna
burn your dick off.

36:18.007 --> 36:21.016
There's a strong chance
that your fire bolts
aren't at full power yet.

36:22.022 --> 36:24.001
Do you want to find out?

36:40.004 --> 36:42.000
Now understand that if you
leave with her,

36:42.002 --> 36:43.010
then that's final sale.

36:43.012 --> 36:44.020
The government has
neither the means

36:44.022 --> 36:47.002
nor the appetite
to pursue a lethal alien.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.021
She's your problem now.

36:49.017 --> 36:50.021
What else is new?

37:07.023 --> 37:08.021
Get in.

37:11.002 --> 37:12.023
Where are you taking me?

37:13.001 --> 37:15.002
Are you serious?
You'd rather stay down there?

37:15.004 --> 37:18.001
-I don't trust you.
-Goes both ways, sister.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.001
Look, either stay here
or come with us.

37:20.003 --> 37:21.001
But we got to go.

37:21.003 --> 37:22.012
We're gonna have company soon.

37:31.022 --> 37:33.011
Your vehicle is filthy.

37:34.018 --> 37:36.017
-Oh, boy.

37:51.014 --> 37:53.011
There you are,
Dick Grayson.

37:57.006 --> 37:58.014
Let's get this over with.

38:13.018 --> 38:15.008
Wow. Classic moves.

38:15.010 --> 38:17.006
You even fight me
like Bats, huh?

38:48.011 --> 38:50.005
You told Crane everything.

38:51.013 --> 38:52.015
Everything!

38:53.011 --> 38:54.017
This ends here.

38:54.019 --> 38:56.009
What did you think
was gonna happen

38:56.011 --> 38:57.019
after what you did to me?

38:57.021 --> 38:59.003
After what you let happen?

38:59.005 --> 39:00.018
This isn't on me.
You made your own choices.

39:00.020 --> 39:02.003
Like you made yours?

39:02.022 --> 39:04.010
Come on, dude.

39:04.012 --> 39:05.021
You're just like the old man.

39:06.018 --> 39:08.002
A copy.

39:08.004 --> 39:09.022
Everything you do or ever did
is because of him.

39:24.009 --> 39:25.012
But not for long.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.016
Gotham PD!
Drop your weapon!

39:32.009 --> 39:33.017
Six-billion-dollar budget,

39:33.019 --> 39:35.015
and we still can't get
a clear signal.

39:35.017 --> 39:36.022
There. Nine o'clock.

39:39.012 --> 39:40.023
<i>Do you have a shot on Red Hood?</i>

39:41.001 --> 39:41.023
Affirmative!

39:42.001 --> 39:43.011
Permission to engage?

39:43.013 --> 39:44.021
Commissioner?

39:44.023 --> 39:46.004
Commissioner Gordon?

39:48.021 --> 39:49.017
Cleared!

39:52.013 --> 39:54.010
Did you hit the target?

39:54.012 --> 39:55.022
<i>I can't tell.</i>

40:04.004 --> 40:05.000
