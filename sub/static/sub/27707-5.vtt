WEBVTT

00:04.960 --> 00:06.800
She was a woman

00:06.800 --> 00:08.000
who knew her own mind...

00:11.960 --> 00:13.960
..and didn't need a degree to read his.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.960
A Virgin Mary.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.960
And whatever the gentleman would like.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.960
The temperature was rising.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.960
And not just from the city streets.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.960
Neither had seen it coming.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.960
And yet, at the same time, it was inevitable.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.960
Thier destinies were intertwined...

00:55.960 --> 00:58.960
and sealed with a kiss.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
It's not the Life Of Pi, is it?

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
No. You want to keep reading this.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.960
Who are you seeing as the leading lady?

01:15.960 --> 01:17.000
Karen.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.960
She's described as,

01:20.960 --> 01:24.960
"50, effortlessly elegant and with a timeless beauty."

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
Hm.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.640
Well, that does sound like her.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.960
- Thank you.
- And who have you cast as Jake?

01:29.960 --> 01:32.960
"Urbane, ripped and smouldering."

01:32.960 --> 01:34.640
Huh.

01:35.960 --> 01:36.960
Oh, no...

01:36.960 --> 01:38.960
No.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.960
Oh, yes.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.960
I know Jen wouldn't want to fuss,

01:42.960 --> 01:44.960
but I didn't want to not make a fuss.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.960
Yeah, I get it.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.320
Oh, no. It's not Mum's birthday, is it?

01:48.320 --> 01:50.800
It's her first day of chemotherapy.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.960
Oh, thank God for that.

01:52.960 --> 01:53.960
Adam!

01:53.960 --> 01:56.160
- Yeah, sorry.
- Has she said how she's feeling?

01:57.960 --> 01:58.960
She's feeling...

01:59.960 --> 02:01.960
- ..brilliant.
- Yes.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.960
We're off to a new bar in town tonight called Chemotherapy.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.800
That's why she's all dressed up!

02:08.960 --> 02:09.960
So, it's... It was a joke.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.640
Are you going to lose your hair?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.960
I hope not.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.960
- She's getting a Dutch cap.
- A cold cap!

02:17.960 --> 02:19.960
If you lose yours, I'll shave mine off.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.960
Well, that'll please your dad.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.960
He won't have to nag you about clogging up the shower.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.960
Love you.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.960
We should go.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.640
Fancy joining us to eat tonight, you and the girls?

02:30.640 --> 02:33.960
She can't. She's got a date with the vicar.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.960
No, I haven't. We're just going out for a bite to eat.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.960
Sometimes known as dinner.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.480
As in... dinner date.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.960
It's not a date!

02:43.960 --> 02:45.960
It's not a date.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.960
- It is a date.
- But why's she pretending it isn't?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.960
Ah, Charles.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.960
Jennifer.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.160
Hello.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.960
Er, this is the husband, Pete.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.960
Or "the longsuffering Pete", as I've come to think of him.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
Are you all right?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.960
Yeah, couldn't be better.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
Well...

03:04.960 --> 03:06.800
Yeah.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.960
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, a bit weird.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.640
I'm more scared of the chemo than I am of the cancer.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.960
Yeah, I know what you mean.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
You don't need to stay. Charlie's here. I'll be all right.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.960
I'll hold her hand. I'm a pro.

03:20.960 --> 03:21.960
Right.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.000
Erm...

03:24.960 --> 03:26.960
- Call me when you're finished, love.
- Yeah.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.960
- See ya later.
- Yeah, bye.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.960
I've found you a chair here.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.800
Are you all right?

03:34.640 --> 03:36.960
I just wondered if you and Caitlin fancied joining us?

03:36.960 --> 03:39.960
- What, like a double date?
- 'It's not a date.'

03:39.960 --> 03:41.960
Well, it won't be if you two come.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.960
Oh, right, I see. Yeah, yeah, safety in numbers.

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
'Something like that, yep.'

03:47.960 --> 03:49.960
Oooh, gotta go. Nina B St James is here.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.320
Who?

03:52.320 --> 03:53.960
'Author of Love Comes Slowly.'

03:53.960 --> 03:56.960
Ooh, I'd like to meet her. I'm a huge fan.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
'Yeah, so Caitlin said.'

03:58.960 --> 04:00.160
'I'll call you back.'

04:00.160 --> 04:01.960
Er...

04:01.960 --> 04:03.160
Rude.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.960
Benjamin!

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
Nina not with you?

04:06.960 --> 04:08.960
No. She's, er...

04:08.960 --> 04:09.960
a little shy.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.960
She'd prefer it if I spoke on her behalf.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.960
Well, that's not going to work, is it?

04:12.960 --> 04:15.800
What about when she has to do interviews?

04:15.800 --> 04:16.959
She won't.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.640
Oh, for God's sake, I need to meet her.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.800
You can't.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.959
Benjamin, come on, call her. I'll go to her. I don't mind.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.960
- Come on.
- No, you don't understand.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.960
There is no Nina B St James.

04:29.960 --> 04:30.960
Well, who is she, then?

04:32.160 --> 04:33.960
He.

04:33.960 --> 04:34.960
She is a he.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.960
I am Nina B St James.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.960
What?

04:42.960 --> 04:46.800
She's my alter ego when I write romantic fiction.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.960
It's an anagram of my name.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.960
Well, actually, it's not. It's as close as I could get.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.960
Too many vowels in Benjamin Stevens.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
So...

04:55.960 --> 04:57.640
you write romantic fiction?

04:58.960 --> 05:00.960
You do it very well, Benjamin.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.960
Thank you.

David?

06:37.960 --> 06:39.960
Robyn!

06:39.960 --> 06:41.960
What a coincidence. Where are you flying to?

06:41.960 --> 06:43.960
Sorry. Excuse me.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.960
Ibiza. I have a meeting.

06:48.960 --> 06:49.960
In Ibiza?

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
People do have meetings in Ibiza occasionally.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.960
Hm.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.960
My flight to Zurich's delayed.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.320
Ah.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.960
Have you got time to grab a spot of lunch?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.960
My treat.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.640
Excellent!

07:01.640 --> 07:03.960
Hm. The restaurant in the executive lounge

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
is rather good.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
- Oh!
- David?

07:08.960 --> 07:10.960
Passport. I must've left it in the car!

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
Oh, catch me up.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.960
Will do.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.960
Bugger!

07:31.320 --> 07:32.960
Yeah.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.960
I was struggling with what to say.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.960
- Hey!
- Us, on the other hand...

07:37.960 --> 07:39.960
- Hey.
- Aw...

07:39.960 --> 07:40.960
Hello.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.960
- How was it?
- Oh, I got through it.

07:44.960 --> 07:45.960
She sacked off her cold cap.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.960
Er, well, it was freezing.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.960
They should call it the polar icecap.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.960
- What about your hair?
- I'm not doing that again.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.960
It gave me a splitting headache.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.480
Unless that was this one.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.960
I was banging on at her about joining our choir.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.960
Jen?

08:00.960 --> 08:02.160
No chance.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.800
Well, it is the Cancer Choir, to be fair.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.960
Is it your voice you're worried about or...?

08:07.960 --> 08:11.960
Yeah. That and looking like I actually belong in a choir.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.960
We'd better get going. I'm on a meter.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.480
Yeah, OK.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.960
- I'll call you later.
- I'll answer.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.960
- Hm.
- See ya.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.320
See ya.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.320
I'm a bit knackered.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.960
I'm looking forward to this.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
Breaking bread with a vicar.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.960
A man of the tablecloth.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.799
- Are you going to keep this up all night?
- Er...

08:39.960 --> 08:42.960
No, no. I think I'm, er, done now.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.960
Thanks.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.960
- Can I get you any drinks at all?
- Er, could we have some water?

08:49.960 --> 08:52.160
Dan can turn it into wine.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.960
You don't mind I invited my friends?

08:54.960 --> 08:56.960
No, I'm looking forward to meeting them.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
It's not like it's a date anyway, so...

08:59.960 --> 09:00.960
Adam. Nice to meet you.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.000
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. I'm Caitlin. Nice to meet you.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.640
'Hello, and welcome to The Chase.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.960
'Can a team of total strangers beat one of Brit...'

09:08.960 --> 09:09.960
Hiya.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.960
'..and take home thousands of pounds? I hope so. Let's meet them.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
'With me is Mark Labbett, who tried twerking last week

09:15.960 --> 09:16.960
'and flattened half of Clacton.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.960
'What about The Dark Destroyer?'

09:18.960 --> 09:20.160
Are you all right, love?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.800
Will you adopt me?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.960
'Or perhaps it's The Governess, Anne Hegerty.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.960
'She took out Sylvester Stallone last week...'

09:29.320 --> 09:30.960
I'm sorry?

09:30.960 --> 09:34.000
I know you're already my dad, but I'd like it to be legal.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.960
Is this because of what your mum's going through?

09:37.960 --> 09:40.960
What if something happens to her and Grant says he wants me back?

09:40.960 --> 09:43.000
Well, he couldn't. I wouldn't let him.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.960
Oh, sweetheart.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.960
Now's probably not a good time to raise this. I mean...

09:49.960 --> 09:52.800
Your mum needs our support.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.320
Nothing's going to happen to her.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.960
I promise you,

09:56.960 --> 09:58.960
she's not going anywhere.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.160
Bye!

10:06.960 --> 10:08.960
Where's she gone?

10:08.960 --> 10:10.960
She said something about a choir.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.960
Come here.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.960
Benjamin is Nina B.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.960
God, you'd never guess.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.960
Well, can't judge a book by his cover.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.800
Didn't you think he might be a cross-dresser?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.960
- Definitely into S&M.
- Unlike David, into M.&S.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.960
Sorry, sorry. This is really boring for you.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.480
Sorry. S&M? Hardly.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.960
You do know he's in love with you?

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
What?

10:41.960 --> 10:42.960
Benjamin.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.960
- His description of his heroine, it's you.
- No!

10:45.960 --> 10:47.960
- It is. Didn't I say?
- Yes, he did. Yes.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.960
What's the heroine like?

10:49.960 --> 10:50.960
Sexy.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
Sophisticated. Alluring.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.160
Is that how you see Karen?

10:56.640 --> 10:57.960
Well...

10:59.960 --> 11:01.640
Well, don't...? Don't you?

11:01.640 --> 11:02.960
Yeah.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.960
I think he's got you down to a T.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.960
Fantastic. Now we're going to do some "heys" and "hos".

11:12.960 --> 11:14.960
So, after three, we're going to do a big "hey".

11:14.960 --> 11:16.960
Right from the diaphragm.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.160
- One, two three...
- Hey!

11:18.160 --> 11:19.960
- Hi, two, three.
- Hi!

11:19.960 --> 11:21.960
- Yay, two, three.
- Yay!

11:21.960 --> 11:23.960
- Hey, two, three.
- Hey!

11:23.960 --> 11:25.640
- Yo, two, three.
- Yo!

11:25.640 --> 11:27.960
- Yay, two, three.
- Yay!

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
- Huh, two, three.
- Huh!

11:28.960 --> 11:30.960
- You, two, three.
- You!

11:30.960 --> 11:33.480
- Yay, two, three...
- Wrong way, missy.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.960
Charlie...

11:35.960 --> 11:37.640
Er, look, thanks. But I really...

11:37.640 --> 11:38.960
I don't think it's my kind of thing.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.960
No-one ever really does until they try.

11:41.960 --> 11:42.960
Come on.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.960
- Oooh, two, three.
- Oooh!

11:44.960 --> 11:46.960
- Wow! two, three.
- Wow!

11:46.960 --> 11:47.960
Ha, two, three...

11:47.960 --> 11:49.960
Look, I'm not denying anyone their right

11:49.960 --> 11:51.960
to believe in a beardy old man sitting on a cloud.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.960
I'm just saying I don't believe in it myself.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.960
But you do look down on Christians, though, be honest.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.960
- Doesn't make much sense.
- What, faith?

11:58.960 --> 11:59.960
- Yeah.
- No.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.960
Nope, it makes no sense at all.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.480
And for the record, I don't believe in the

12:03.480 --> 12:04.960
beardy old man up in the clouds, either.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.960
But I'm sorry. I didn't mean to monopolise.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.960
Well, it was Adam that brought it up.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.000
Only because it's a load of old bollocks.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.960
Faith? Religion? What?

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
All of it.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.960
Churches... Don't get me started on churches.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.960
We give people hope.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.960
And comfort, on a practical level, too.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.320
Well, I wish I did more.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.960
Well, we do run a soup kitchen at lunchtimes.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.960
We're always looking for volunteers.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.960
Difficult during the working hours, you know?

12:29.960 --> 12:31.960
Hm. Well, we've all got our priorities.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.960
And here endeth the sermon.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.640
Hm.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.640
- Should we have dessert?
- Defo.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.960
Thank you.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.960
Thank you.

Well, you could always persevere with the cold cap.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.570
Nah.

14:43.570 --> 14:46.210
I'd rather wear one of these than suffer that every time.

14:46.210 --> 14:47.210
Right, then.

14:53.210 --> 14:55.210
Right...

14:58.210 --> 15:00.210
The thing is, I'd love to adopt Chloe.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.210
Yeah, but you're already her dad.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.210
Yeah, but with an asterisk.

15:05.210 --> 15:07.210
I nearly cried when she asked me.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.210
- What can I get you?
- Two pints of lager please, mate.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.210
Is David coming?

15:12.210 --> 15:14.210
I left him a message but he hasn't returned my calls.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.210
Well, me neither. Maybe he's dropped us.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.210
No.

15:17.210 --> 15:19.730
Hey, why don't you mention to Jen about Chloe?

15:19.730 --> 15:21.210
I can't.

15:21.210 --> 15:23.890
- She's already got enough on her mind.
- Oh, yeah.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.210
Oh! What do you think?

15:27.210 --> 15:29.210
Well, what effect are you going for?

15:30.210 --> 15:32.210
I don't know. Bowie.

15:32.210 --> 15:33.890
Cilla?

15:33.890 --> 15:38.210
We are gonna 'ave a lorra, lorra laughs!

15:38.210 --> 15:40.210
Oh. Hello.

15:41.210 --> 15:44.210
- Cancer Choir.
- How are you finding that?

15:44.210 --> 15:46.210
Do you know, I'm loving it.

15:47.210 --> 15:50.210
It's just one, big, happy family.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.410
Our own little cancer cluster.

15:53.410 --> 15:57.210
I'm just very grateful Charlie talked me into it, to be honest.

15:58.210 --> 16:01.210
He's been brilliant, even though he's not well himself.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.210
He sounds like a good man.

16:03.210 --> 16:04.250
Yeah.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.210
Yeah, he is.

16:09.570 --> 16:13.210
I don't see why she confides in this Charlie rather than me.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.410
Well, because he understands.

16:14.410 --> 16:17.210
- I can understand.
- Yeah, but not like him, mate.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.410
You're jealous of a dying man.

16:21.210 --> 16:23.250
- Whatever helps Jen, eh?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.210
Ta.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.410
You know, er...

16:29.410 --> 16:30.890
I mean, if...

16:32.210 --> 16:35.210
I know it's not easy when someone you care for

16:35.210 --> 16:36.570
turns to someone else.

16:38.210 --> 16:42.210
It happened the other night to me with Karen on our double date.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.570
I love a Christening.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.210
Don't you?

16:47.210 --> 16:49.210
I thought it wasn't a date.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.570
It was by the end of the evening.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.890
Well, it's hardly like me and Jen.

16:53.890 --> 16:55.210
I still didn't like it.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.210
Hm. Now who's jealous?

16:58.890 --> 17:00.210
Yeah.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.210
We kissed.

17:06.210 --> 17:07.210
Who?

17:07.210 --> 17:09.210
Me and Karen, recently.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.210
What?

17:14.210 --> 17:16.050
- Where?
- At the festival.

17:16.050 --> 17:18.210
You kissed Karen at the festival?

17:18.210 --> 17:21.210
- Nothing wrong with your hearing, then.
- Oh, my God!

17:21.210 --> 17:23.050
This is huge.

17:23.050 --> 17:25.210
It was just one kiss. We were both stoned.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.890
You know, Karen was at pains to say that it meant nothing.

17:27.890 --> 17:29.210
"At pains"?

17:29.210 --> 17:32.210
Well, as soon as we got back, she set me up with Caitlin.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.250
Adam...

17:33.250 --> 17:34.890
this is Karen.

17:34.890 --> 17:37.210
Nothing means nothing to her.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.210
And if she pushed Caitlin towards you,

17:40.210 --> 17:43.210
it's because she was creating a diversion.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.570
It was one kiss, which meant...

17:48.210 --> 17:50.210
..nothing.

17:50.210 --> 17:52.210
Yeah. Yeah.

17:52.210 --> 17:53.210
Yeah.

17:55.210 --> 17:56.730
Yeah, yeah, I know it doesn't help

17:56.730 --> 17:58.730
when people say that your exams will be a breeze.

17:58.730 --> 18:01.210
But in your case, Liv, I'm sure they will be.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.210
Yeah, all right, all right.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:06.050 --> 18:08.050
Good luck. Good luck.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.730
Love you.

18:13.210 --> 18:16.210
- Well, this is a coincidence.
- Robyn!

18:16.210 --> 18:19.410
What are the chances of us bumping into each other twice?

18:19.410 --> 18:22.250
Yeah. Unless you were on my flight from Ibiza.

18:24.210 --> 18:26.210
Did you forget to pack a razor?

18:26.210 --> 18:29.570
Oh, I'm just, you know, trying to blend in with the hipsters.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.210
Yeah, some way to go.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.210
Do you need a lift?

18:33.210 --> 18:36.210
Er, no, thank you. Er, the office are sending a car for me.

18:36.210 --> 18:37.210
It's a limo.

18:37.210 --> 18:38.250
Uh-huh.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.210
Hold on, I thought you said you had your car here.

18:42.210 --> 18:43.210
You left your passport in it.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.210
Yes.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.210
I left the lights on.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.570
Flat battery.

18:51.570 --> 18:54.210
Is everything all right, David?

18:54.210 --> 18:56.210
Of course, yeah.

18:56.210 --> 18:59.730
Obviously, one's a little concerned about... Europe.

18:59.730 --> 19:01.210
Right.

19:02.210 --> 19:04.210
Well...

19:04.210 --> 19:05.210
look after yourself.

19:21.210 --> 19:23.210
Oh, yes!

19:23.210 --> 19:24.730
This is me.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.210
Now, that is how I imagine Nina B St James to look.

19:27.210 --> 19:30.210
- Oh, yeah, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.210
OK.

19:31.210 --> 19:32.210
Erm...

19:32.210 --> 19:35.410
She trailed her fingers across his chest.

19:35.410 --> 19:38.210
He needed release

19:38.210 --> 19:39.570
and only she held the key.

19:39.570 --> 19:43.210
- Oh, my God, Jen. That is it!
- Yeah, what?

19:43.210 --> 19:45.890
- Forget it. Forget it.
- What? Seriously.

19:45.890 --> 19:47.210
No, honestly, it doesn't matter.

19:47.210 --> 19:49.210
I can't forget it if I don't know what it is.

19:49.210 --> 19:51.210
OK, I need a photograph of Nina B St James

19:51.210 --> 19:52.210
for the cover of the book.

19:52.210 --> 19:55.210
- Obviously, it can't be Benjamin.
- Not if you want to sell any.

19:55.210 --> 19:58.050
- You're thinking me?
- I think you've got enough on your plate.

19:58.050 --> 20:00.210
No. It's a brilliant idea.

20:00.210 --> 20:03.210
Seriously, you should focus on getting well.

20:03.210 --> 20:05.210
- That is the most important thing.
- Please...

20:05.210 --> 20:07.210
Don't leave me stuck at home

20:07.210 --> 20:09.210
listening to the chemo surging through my veins.

20:09.210 --> 20:11.210
- Please, please, please!
- OK.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.210
If you're sure.

20:12.210 --> 20:15.050
I insist, darling.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.210
Hello, Robyn?

20:19.210 --> 20:21.250
'I'm calling about our ex-husband.'

20:21.250 --> 20:23.570
Does that sound as odd to you as it does to me?

- Hey, there he is.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.210
Looking sharp.

21:50.210 --> 21:53.210
I am so sorry.

21:53.210 --> 21:55.210
Why didn't you ask for help?

21:55.210 --> 21:57.410
I thought I could turn things round.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.210
I knew I had to dig deep.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.210
But the next thing I knew, I'd dug so deep

22:03.210 --> 22:04.210
I couldn't get out of the hole.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.210
And all I had left...

22:09.210 --> 22:10.890
..was pride.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.210
David...

22:16.210 --> 22:19.210
Oh, I must use Adam's aftershave more often.

22:23.210 --> 22:24.210

22:26.210 --> 22:27.730
You come to mine when you're ready, OK?

22:27.730 --> 22:29.210
Karen...

22:29.210 --> 22:32.210
You're welcome round ours any time, mate.

22:32.210 --> 22:35.050
Yeah, you might have to bunk in with me mum, but...

22:35.050 --> 22:36.210
we'll find the room, eh?

22:38.210 --> 22:39.210
One for mine.

22:41.210 --> 22:44.210
Consider these your...

22:44.210 --> 22:45.210
access all areas.

22:47.210 --> 22:49.210
Oh, Jesus, don't cry, please.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.210
Oh, Jen, I still can't get over Da...

23:01.210 --> 23:03.210
What the hell are you doing?! No!

23:03.210 --> 23:05.210
Give it here.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.410
- I'm getting into character.
- What?

23:07.410 --> 23:10.730
Are you having a reaction to your medication?

23:10.730 --> 23:13.210
I'm doing that photo shoot for Karen later.

23:14.210 --> 23:16.210
OK. Er...

23:17.210 --> 23:19.210
Oh, no. Chuck us Mum's glasses.

23:20.570 --> 23:22.210
There you go.

23:25.210 --> 23:27.210
Oh, yeah. That's better.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.570
I...

23:28.570 --> 23:31.210
I am Nina B St James.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.210
Smashed it.

23:33.210 --> 23:34.410
She shouldn't have asked you.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.210
You're not well.

23:37.570 --> 23:40.570
But Nina's feeling... just great.

23:42.210 --> 23:44.210
So let me have a bit of fun, eh?

23:45.210 --> 23:47.410
Go on, pop that back up for me, will ya?

23:52.210 --> 23:54.210
- Morning!
- Are the girls ready?

23:54.210 --> 23:57.210
Uh, Liv's doing some last-minute revision.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.410
Ellie's doing her hair.

23:58.410 --> 24:00.210
- That sounds about right.
- Yeah.

24:00.210 --> 24:02.210
- Can you bring the car back?
- Sure.

24:02.210 --> 24:04.410
Thanks for letting me take them. And...

24:06.210 --> 24:08.210
You know, I'm sorry to have put you to all that trouble.

24:08.210 --> 24:11.210
Mate, you have got to stop apologising.

24:11.210 --> 24:12.210
That's what Nikki used to say.

24:12.210 --> 24:14.210
So sorry things didn't work out with you two.

24:14.210 --> 24:16.210
What went wrong?

24:16.210 --> 24:19.210
Oh, it seemed we didn't have as much in common as I thought.

24:19.210 --> 24:21.210
Yeah, we could've stumbled along.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.210
But it's better to be with no-one than the wrong one.

24:26.210 --> 24:28.210
- Certainly more honest.
- We need to go!

24:28.210 --> 24:31.210
- Where's your sister?
- I can't find my pencil.

24:31.210 --> 24:33.210
It's a history exam. What do you need a pencil for?

24:33.210 --> 24:35.210
- My eyebrows.
- Oh, my God!

24:35.210 --> 24:37.210
- She's not making me late.
- Your eyebrows look lovely.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.210
We're going.

24:39.210 --> 24:41.210
Good luck, both of you!

24:41.210 --> 24:43.210
Remember to read both sides of the paper.

24:43.210 --> 24:44.210
Yeah, all right, Adam!

24:46.210 --> 24:47.210
Something I said?

24:47.210 --> 24:49.210
Usually.

24:49.210 --> 24:51.210
Bye.

24:51.210 --> 24:52.210
Bye.

25:02.050 --> 25:03.210
Oh!

25:03.210 --> 25:06.210
Er... Do I look ridiculous?

25:06.210 --> 25:07.210
You look amazing!

25:07.210 --> 25:08.890
Aw!

25:10.210 --> 25:12.210
Look, look. Darjeeling.

25:13.210 --> 25:15.210
- I thought Nina would.
- Very good.

25:15.210 --> 25:17.210
So, who's taking the pics?

25:17.210 --> 25:19.210
Annie Leibovitz?

25:19.210 --> 25:21.210
It's Benjamin. He does a night class.

25:21.210 --> 25:23.410
Reckons he's a bit of a dab hand.

25:23.410 --> 25:24.570
Look, here he is.

25:24.570 --> 25:27.210
Oh, well, he's certainly got all the gear.

25:29.210 --> 25:31.210
Benjamin, this is...

25:31.210 --> 25:33.570
- Nina B St James.
- Oh, yes.

25:33.570 --> 25:35.210
Very good.

25:35.210 --> 25:38.210
- Very good indeed.
- Oh!

25:38.210 --> 25:39.210
Oh!

25:39.210 --> 25:41.210
I love being posh.

25:44.890 --> 25:48.210
Yeah, some women would love to see their ex-husbands homeless.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.410
- Yeah. Not Karen, though.
- No.

25:50.410 --> 25:53.210
No, she's not vindictive.

25:53.210 --> 25:56.210
She can be a little bit dry sometimes, but, er...

25:56.210 --> 25:58.210
Hey, look, I love her. Don't get me wrong.

25:58.210 --> 26:00.210
But she's just... Well, she's not always fun.

26:01.210 --> 26:02.210
Not always, no.

26:02.210 --> 26:05.210
But, you know, she's a single mum with teenagers.

26:05.210 --> 26:07.050
She's got her own business to run.

26:07.050 --> 26:08.210
I think she's great fun.

26:08.210 --> 26:10.210
You're a loyal friend.

26:10.210 --> 26:11.210
I should hope so.

26:11.210 --> 26:13.210
- And she defends you, too.
- She does?

26:13.210 --> 26:16.210
Yeah, I was showing her my cover art for Love Comes Slowly

26:16.210 --> 26:18.210
and she thinks the book can appeal to men and women

26:18.210 --> 26:20.210
and I said you'd enjoyed it.

26:20.210 --> 26:23.210
Mind you, it's about his intellectual level.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.410
Adam's not shallow.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.570
Mm, he's not a deep thinker either, is he?

26:27.570 --> 26:29.210
Thank God.

26:29.210 --> 26:31.210
Or I couldn't keep up with him.

26:31.210 --> 26:34.210
Well, there's a lot more to him than you'd think.

26:35.210 --> 26:36.210
Karen said that?

26:39.210 --> 26:40.210
Yeah.

26:40.210 --> 26:42.410
I thought you'd be more concerned about what I said.

26:42.410 --> 26:45.210
Yes, we'll be coming to that shortly. But, seriously...

26:45.210 --> 26:47.210
Karen said that about me?

26:47.210 --> 26:50.210
Yes. Should we have another one before happy hour ends?

26:50.210 --> 26:52.210
Too bloody right.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.890
We're here for a good time, not a long time.

26:56.210 --> 26:59.210
♪ Everytime I see your face

26:59.210 --> 27:03.210
♪ It reminds me of the place We used to go

27:06.210 --> 27:09.210
♪ All she got is a photograph... ♪

27:09.210 --> 27:10.210
And pout!

27:10.210 --> 27:11.210
I...

27:11.210 --> 27:13.210
I don't think Nina pouts.

27:13.210 --> 27:14.210
- No, Nina pouts.
- Hm.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.210
What, like that?

27:16.210 --> 27:17.210
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's it.

27:17.210 --> 27:19.210
Now, work it, Nina. Work it.

27:19.210 --> 27:20.210
- Yeah.
- Oh, all right.

27:20.210 --> 27:22.210
Maybe a bit of cleavage?

27:22.210 --> 27:24.210
Er, no, Jen. Benjamin, no, no.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.210
That is not the image we're going for here. No.

27:26.210 --> 27:29.210
Oh, for God's sake!

27:29.210 --> 27:30.210
That's it.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.050
Look at that.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.210
That is great, Jen.

27:33.210 --> 27:34.210
Really?

27:52.210 --> 27:54.210
Karen?

27:54.210 --> 27:56.210
I was going to tidy up.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.570
Liv, you're not supposed to be here.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.210
- What happened to your key?
- I gave it to David.

28:08.210 --> 28:10.210
- What for?
- In case he wants to stay.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.210
Here? While Jen is having chemotherapy?

28:12.210 --> 28:14.210
Well, he's not gonna stay.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.250
- Then what did you give him the key for?
- Where is she?

28:16.250 --> 28:19.210
Jen? I don't know. I just got in from Lidl.

28:20.250 --> 28:23.250
Oh, I take a Sainsbury's bag for the walk home.

28:26.210 --> 28:28.210
"Gone to hospital."

28:28.210 --> 28:30.210
- What's Jenny gone to hospital for?
- I don't know.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.210
I still wanted to do well.

28:35.210 --> 28:37.210
I mean, I've done all the revision.

28:37.210 --> 28:39.210
But as soon as I turned the paper over...

28:48.250 --> 28:50.210
I've failed everything!

28:50.210 --> 28:52.210
You left one exam.

28:52.210 --> 28:54.210
It's not the end of the world.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.210
I don't want to be a failure.

28:57.250 --> 28:59.210
None of us do.

29:00.210 --> 29:01.410
Sometimes...

29:01.410 --> 29:04.210
failure is what's necessary for us to grow.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.210
You're just saying that to make me feel less of a loser.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.210
Liv...

29:13.210 --> 29:16.210
do you know where I was sleeping the other night?

29:17.210 --> 29:18.250
At the airport.

29:20.210 --> 29:22.210
And I don't mean waiting for a flight.

29:22.210 --> 29:24.210
I mean, sleeping.

29:25.210 --> 29:28.210
- And not just one night.
- Why?

29:28.210 --> 29:29.210
Because...

29:29.210 --> 29:31.210
I'm not as brave as you.

29:32.210 --> 29:35.210
I couldn't admit to anyone that things had gone wrong.

29:36.210 --> 29:39.210
Looking at the board, seeing flight after flight

29:39.210 --> 29:42.210
to Dubai and Oslo and Lisbon...

29:43.210 --> 29:45.210
I just wanted to escape.

29:47.210 --> 29:48.410
But you know the reason why

29:48.410 --> 29:51.050
I didn't get on one of those flights?

29:51.050 --> 29:52.210
Money?

29:52.210 --> 29:54.730
Yeah, well, money was an issue, obviously, but...

29:54.730 --> 29:56.210
Passport?

29:56.210 --> 29:58.210
Well, yeah, that as well.

29:58.210 --> 30:00.210
But, no, the main thing...

30:01.250 --> 30:03.210
..was you.

30:03.210 --> 30:06.210
Nothing matters more to me.

30:06.210 --> 30:07.570
You are what makes me happy.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.210
Not success.

30:09.210 --> 30:11.210
You.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.210
So, when's your next exam?

30:13.210 --> 30:15.210
In 45 minutes.

30:16.570 --> 30:19.890
Perfect. No time for revision. No time for stress.

30:19.890 --> 30:22.210
Huh? You can just enjoy yourself.

30:22.210 --> 30:25.210
Show them how bright you are without any weight of expectation.

30:27.050 --> 30:29.210
So, come on. Good job I've got your mum's car.

30:29.210 --> 30:30.210
Where's yours?

30:31.210 --> 30:32.250
Yeah... Come on.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.210
Jen!

30:51.210 --> 30:53.890
- Hiya.
- Oh, my God, are you all right?

30:53.890 --> 30:55.210
Hey? Yeah, yeah.

30:55.210 --> 30:58.210
I'm fine. I'm a bit knackered. But what are you doing here?

30:58.210 --> 31:00.210
Your message telling me to get to the hospital.

31:00.210 --> 31:03.210
No, it said I was at the hospital.

31:03.210 --> 31:06.210
- Yes.
- Oh, I see...

31:06.210 --> 31:08.210
What did they say? Was it the dizziness? Do you need to sit down?

31:08.210 --> 31:09.210
- Look, it's Charlie.
- Charlie?

31:09.210 --> 31:11.210
Yeah, yeah. He had to be admitted.

31:11.210 --> 31:14.050
He's got a high temperature. But he'll be all right.

31:14.050 --> 31:15.730
Well, you've got me on a wild goose chase.

31:15.730 --> 31:17.730
Well, I didn't know you were gonna come.

31:17.730 --> 31:19.210
"Gone to the hospital."

31:19.210 --> 31:21.210
What do you think I'd think? Jesus, Jen!

31:23.210 --> 31:24.210
Oh, well...

31:24.210 --> 31:27.210
Look, I'm sorry. At least he's going to be all right.

31:27.210 --> 31:29.570
Rushing around, photo shoots, choirs. I thought you'd collapsed!

31:29.570 --> 31:32.210
Look, I said I'm sorry, right?

31:33.250 --> 31:35.730
Do you think about anyone other than yourself?

31:35.730 --> 31:37.210
Well, apart from Charlie, obviously.

31:37.210 --> 31:40.210
What about your family? What if Chloe'd found that note?

31:40.210 --> 31:43.050
- She's terrified as it is!
- Oh, hang on. Hang on.

31:43.050 --> 31:45.210
Chloe, she... She's fine.

31:45.210 --> 31:47.410
She wants me to adopt her.

31:47.410 --> 31:49.210
What?

31:50.210 --> 31:52.210
She's worried you're going to die.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.210
I'm not going to die, love.

32:04.410 --> 32:06.210
Well, one day.

32:06.210 --> 32:10.210
But not before me and your dad have spent all your inheritance.

32:10.210 --> 32:13.210
And no-one will ever take you away from us.

32:13.210 --> 32:15.050
I know.

32:15.050 --> 32:16.210
I've got it in writing.

32:16.210 --> 32:18.210
I emailed Grant.

32:18.210 --> 32:19.570
He replied this morning.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.250
It took him a week.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.210
Oh, of course it did.

32:23.210 --> 32:25.210
He says he'll sign the adoption papers.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.210
Well, what did you say to him?

32:30.210 --> 32:32.050
I'll print out the email.

32:39.210 --> 32:40.890
I'll leave you to it.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.210
You are such a drama queen.

32:50.210 --> 32:52.210
I'm so not.

32:56.210 --> 32:58.890
- Thanks for bringing him round.
- How is she?

32:58.890 --> 33:01.210
Better. This afternoon's exam went well.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.210
Hey.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.210
Whoa, whoa, what's up?

33:08.210 --> 33:10.210
I feel like such a bad parent.

33:10.210 --> 33:12.210
No.

33:12.210 --> 33:15.210
Liv had a meltdown. She works too hard.

33:15.210 --> 33:17.210
Yeah, well, Ellie doesn't work at all.

33:17.210 --> 33:19.730
Yeah, well, between the pair of them, you've got the perfect child.

33:19.730 --> 33:22.210
Thank God David was here. I should've been here.

33:22.210 --> 33:24.210
Oh, stop.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.210
You are as good a single parent as I know.

33:26.210 --> 33:29.210
- I aspire to be as good as you.
- Shut up.

33:29.210 --> 33:31.210
Seriously. If you were any better you'd be...

33:31.210 --> 33:32.250
flawless.

33:32.250 --> 33:34.210
That'd be a disaster for your kids

33:34.210 --> 33:36.210
cos they wouldn't have had anything to push against.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.210
Yeah, well, you don't do so badly yourself.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.730
For a couple years, I was a bit absent there.

33:41.730 --> 33:44.210
But, thankfully, Matt had a wonderful surrogate

33:44.210 --> 33:45.210
who also happened to be you.

33:45.210 --> 33:46.730
My God, you're amazing!

33:49.210 --> 33:50.730
What?

33:52.210 --> 33:53.210
Nothing.

33:54.210 --> 33:56.210
Something David said.

33:57.210 --> 33:59.210
It doesn't matter.

33:59.210 --> 34:00.210
I was making tea.

34:00.210 --> 34:03.210
Oh, Matt wants a barbecue this weekend.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.210
A break from exams.

34:07.050 --> 34:09.050
"And I'm crying

34:09.050 --> 34:11.210
"as I type this because...

34:13.730 --> 34:15.210
"..when I imagine...

34:16.210 --> 34:19.210
"..my world without my mum in it...

34:22.210 --> 34:25.210
"..imagine my life without my mum in it..."

34:25.210 --> 34:27.210
No, I'm sorry. No.

34:30.210 --> 34:32.210
"..I feel like I'd never stop crying.

34:33.210 --> 34:36.409
"But I know I've got Dad. And I know he can be daft.

34:36.409 --> 34:39.210
"And his jokes are awful, but I know...

34:41.210 --> 34:43.210
"..if I need something, he's there."

34:44.570 --> 34:47.210
"A lift, a tenner, a hug."

34:47.210 --> 34:49.210
Oh, give it here.

34:52.210 --> 34:54.210
"And...

34:54.210 --> 34:56.210
"if you have ever cared about me...

34:57.210 --> 34:59.210
"..you'll let me have what I want.

35:00.730 --> 35:02.210
"For Dad to adopt me.

35:02.210 --> 35:04.210
"Love, Chloe."

35:07.210 --> 35:08.210
Come on...

35:11.210 --> 35:12.210
Oh...

35:26.210 --> 35:27.570
Hi.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.730
- Shouldn't you be at work?
- Yeah.

35:30.730 --> 35:32.210
But it's been, er, brought home to me

35:32.210 --> 35:34.050
that some things are more important.

35:35.210 --> 35:36.210
What can I do to help?

35:36.210 --> 35:38.210
Erm...

35:38.210 --> 35:39.210
- What's that?
- Socks.

35:39.210 --> 35:41.210
We're giving everyone a new pair.

35:41.210 --> 35:42.570
Oh, great.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.050
They're the old ones.

35:52.250 --> 35:53.730
We don't have to eat here.

35:53.730 --> 35:55.410
I mean, we came the other night, didn't we?

35:55.410 --> 35:57.210
Thank you.

35:57.210 --> 35:59.210
Although we could make this our place

35:59.210 --> 36:01.210
and, in years to come, fondly reminisce

36:01.210 --> 36:03.210
about the endless servings of sizzling meat.

36:04.210 --> 36:06.210
Let's have a look.

36:12.210 --> 36:13.410
Oooh, chicken thighs. Pork belly.

36:14.410 --> 36:16.410
- What's our limit for tonight?
- I can't do this.

36:16.410 --> 36:18.210
Are you turning vegetarian?

36:20.210 --> 36:21.410
No, erm...

36:23.210 --> 36:25.210
This isn't easy.

36:26.210 --> 36:27.210
Are you dumping me?

36:33.210 --> 36:35.210
That was a joke, Adam.

36:35.210 --> 36:37.210
Oh, my God.

36:37.210 --> 36:40.210
Oh, my God! Oh, my... Oh, my God!

36:40.210 --> 36:42.210
You...? What?

36:43.210 --> 36:44.570
- It's Karen.
- Where?

36:44.570 --> 36:47.210
- No, she's the reason.
- Karen?

36:47.210 --> 36:48.210
Yes, the way the two of you are together.

36:48.210 --> 36:50.210
You want to be with her, not me.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.250
- Oh, God.
- No, I...

36:51.250 --> 36:53.210
I don't know what I want, but...

36:53.210 --> 36:54.410
But this...

36:54.410 --> 36:56.210
I mean, us...

36:57.890 --> 36:59.210
It's better that I'm on my own.

36:59.210 --> 37:01.210
"I think it's better that I'm on my own."

37:01.210 --> 37:03.050
- What?
- That's what you said.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.210
Yeah.

37:04.210 --> 37:07.210
- Look, I'm sorry. You're lovely.
- Shut your chops! Shut your chops!

37:07.210 --> 37:08.570
Shut your chops. Shut it.

37:10.210 --> 37:11.210
Excuse me?

37:11.210 --> 37:13.210
Hello.

37:13.210 --> 37:14.210
Yes, er...

37:18.210 --> 37:20.210
There we go.

37:20.210 --> 37:22.210
He'll buy you another one. Have a lovely meal.

37:23.210 --> 37:24.210
Bye-bye, prick!

37:25.570 --> 37:27.210
Excuse me...

37:32.210 --> 37:33.210
Thank you for coming.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.210
It's you I should be thanking.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.210
Why?

37:37.210 --> 37:39.210
Giving me something to believe in.

37:39.210 --> 37:41.210
Not God, surely?

37:41.210 --> 37:42.570
God, no! I'm sorry...

37:42.570 --> 37:46.210
No, but this, helping people, yeah.

37:47.210 --> 37:50.210
You know, when I was young, I used to go on a lot of demos.

37:50.210 --> 37:53.210
I used to want to smash the system, make the world a better place.

37:54.210 --> 37:56.210
You've reminded me of that.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.210
Well, if you're free this weekend,

38:00.210 --> 38:02.050
there is a march against poverty in London.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.210
I can't promise you tear gas but, erm...

38:07.210 --> 38:09.570
.. afterwards, we could take in the sights.

38:11.210 --> 38:13.210
Yeah.

38:14.210 --> 38:16.210
Yeah?

38:16.210 --> 38:17.210
Great.

38:24.410 --> 38:26.210
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

38:26.210 --> 38:28.730
- You're joking me?
- Yeah, that's what I've heard.

38:28.730 --> 38:32.210
Karen's not coming? But I've got all these sausages.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.250
Well, she is coming.

38:33.250 --> 38:37.210
She's not stopping. She's going to London with Dan.

38:37.210 --> 38:38.210
Really?

38:38.210 --> 38:40.210
Yeah, they're staying over.

38:40.210 --> 38:42.210
I suspect there may be a laying on of hands.

38:42.210 --> 38:43.210
Ha!

38:45.210 --> 38:47.250
I've got it!

38:47.250 --> 38:49.210
Karen, hi. We're in the back garden.

38:49.210 --> 38:52.210
Oh, David. Before we go through, can I have a word?

38:56.410 --> 38:58.210
I'd like to give you some money.

38:59.210 --> 39:00.210
No, Karen...

39:00.210 --> 39:02.570
No, it's your money, that you invested.

39:03.570 --> 39:05.210
That's if you'd like to be bought out.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.210
Well, it would certainly help.

39:15.210 --> 39:17.210
- This is more than I put in.
- Inflation.

39:18.410 --> 39:20.210
Growth.

39:20.210 --> 39:21.210
Perhaps a little gratitude.

39:23.730 --> 39:25.210
You bailed me out, David.

39:25.210 --> 39:27.210
Oh...

39:27.210 --> 39:28.210
What can I say?

39:28.210 --> 39:30.210
Thank you.

39:31.410 --> 39:35.210
Just one thing. Could I have some of it in cash, till I get to the bank?

39:40.410 --> 39:42.210
Hey, Adam.

39:44.210 --> 39:45.570
Er, I owe you this.

39:46.730 --> 39:49.210
- Don't be silly. This is my treat.
- Er, no.

39:50.210 --> 39:53.210
I stole it... when I stayed over.

39:54.210 --> 39:56.210
I'm sorry.

39:57.210 --> 39:58.250
I hope you'll forgive me.

40:00.210 --> 40:01.570
You borrowed it.

40:01.570 --> 40:04.210
If you stole it, you wouldn't be paying it back.

40:06.210 --> 40:08.250
- David.
- Nah.

40:10.210 --> 40:12.050
A tenner says it's Pete.

40:12.890 --> 40:14.210
I know that innocent look.

40:15.570 --> 40:19.210
He's focused, circling his prey.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.210
Men and their barbecue tools.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.210
It'll be subtle,

40:23.210 --> 40:25.210
but it'll be swift.

40:25.210 --> 40:26.210
Here he goes...

40:26.210 --> 40:28.210
Boom!

40:30.210 --> 40:32.410
That's my boy.

40:34.210 --> 40:36.210
May I touch you up, madam?

40:36.210 --> 40:37.890
You wish.

40:37.890 --> 40:40.050
I'm all right. I'm pacing myself.

40:46.210 --> 40:48.210
- Is that the chemo?
- Probably.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.210
I spoke to Caitlin.

40:53.210 --> 40:54.210
Ah.

40:56.210 --> 40:58.210
- What did she say?
- That you split up.

41:00.730 --> 41:02.210
Was that all?

41:02.210 --> 41:04.250
Yeah. Why, was there something else?

41:04.250 --> 41:05.730
No.

41:08.210 --> 41:09.210
Why did you end it?

41:15.730 --> 41:17.210
It's David's fault.

41:17.210 --> 41:19.210
That thing he said.

41:21.210 --> 41:23.210
Better to be with no-one...

41:25.050 --> 41:27.210
..if you can't be with the right one.

41:27.210 --> 41:28.730
Excuse me.

41:28.730 --> 41:30.210
Er, excuse me.

41:30.210 --> 41:32.210
Matt, can you turn the music down? Yes.

41:32.210 --> 41:33.890
Thanks.

41:33.890 --> 41:35.210
Erm, I'd just like to say a few words.

41:35.210 --> 41:37.210
Er, not a lot.

41:37.210 --> 41:39.210
Just to thank you.

41:39.210 --> 41:40.210
Er, it...

41:40.210 --> 41:44.210
It's easy to lose sight of what's really important.

41:45.210 --> 41:47.210
And... I did.

41:49.210 --> 41:51.210
But thanks to friends...

41:53.210 --> 41:54.210
..and family...

41:55.210 --> 41:56.410
..and both of my ex-wives,

41:56.410 --> 41:59.890
I'm reminded of what really matters.

42:02.210 --> 42:03.730
And that's about it, really.

42:05.210 --> 42:06.210
Yeah. Everything.

42:06.210 --> 42:07.210
Enjoy!

42:07.210 --> 42:09.050
Hey!

42:09.050 --> 42:10.210
Aw! Love you, Dad!

42:10.210 --> 42:11.250
Well done, David.

42:13.210 --> 42:16.210
Erm, actually, we've got an announcement, too.

42:16.210 --> 42:18.210
Chloe, you come and say it.

42:18.210 --> 42:19.210
Go on, Chlo!

42:21.210 --> 42:24.210
We've made an application...

42:24.210 --> 42:26.410
for my dad to adopt me.

42:30.210 --> 42:32.410
The probationary period has gone well. So, er...

42:32.410 --> 42:34.210
I thought I'd risk it.

42:36.210 --> 42:37.210
Mm.

42:38.210 --> 42:40.210
I love a happy ending.

42:41.210 --> 42:43.210
I have to go.

42:43.210 --> 42:44.210
Do you?

42:48.210 --> 42:49.210
Really?

42:51.250 --> 42:53.210
If I want to get this train, yeah.

43:40.210 --> 43:42.210
I've told Pete to stay.

43:42.210 --> 43:44.210
I'll only be in me pjs

43:44.210 --> 43:47.210
watching 60-Minute Makeovers through my eyelids.

43:47.210 --> 43:49.210
- Are you sure you're gonna be OK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:49.210 --> 43:51.210
- I'm just a bit tired.
- Yeah.

43:51.210 --> 43:52.570
- Thanks, though.
- All right, love.

43:52.570 --> 43:54.210
- See ya.
- Take care.

But you said, "If you can't be with the right one."
