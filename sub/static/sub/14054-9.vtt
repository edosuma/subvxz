00:02.440 --> 00:04.317
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- This is school?

00:04.480 --> 00:07.631
If you graduate from here, you can
get into any college in the UC system.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.439
What happens in Mexico, you know,
stays in Mexico. 

00:10.600 --> 00:12.113
You don't deserve her.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.032
- I didn't want to kill myself.
- I know.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.555
- I'm so sorry about everything.
- Go away.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.030
- Our chemistry is undeniable.
- I don't have a date to the cotillion.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.519
Would you be my escort?

00:21.680 --> 00:24.353
- Good news! I'm available.
- No.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.750
- Who's Rachel?
- She works at the law firm I met with.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.309
- So if I did take this job...
- You already have.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.277
- This is Rachel.
- I'm Rachel.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.271
You and Marissa want different things.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.716
- You don't know what she wants!
- She doesn't want to live with you.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.872
I wanna live with Dad.
At least for now.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.632
Ryan's had a lot to overcome.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.360
- Not exactly Harbor School material.
- Give me a shot.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.035
First day of school. Excited?

01:01.560 --> 01:05.838
You know, I ask you questions in
the hopes of eliciting an actual response.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.878
- I feel I convey more with a look.
- You look adorable.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.393
- No.
- Cute?

01:10.560 --> 01:13.028
- Dope? Rad?
- Please, this is so painful!

01:13.200 --> 01:14.474
I'm sorry.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.108
- How was surfing?
- Cut it short.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.874
I wanted to see the boys off.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.679
Doesn't Seth look rad?

01:22.840 --> 01:25.718
Oh, you do look rad! Mad props, son.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.354
Thank God. Are you ready to go?

01:29.520 --> 01:31.476
First day. You excited?

01:31.640 --> 01:33.392
Enough said.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.916
How do you do that? How do you
convey everything with just a look?

01:37.080 --> 01:38.513
And again.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.990
- How are you doing? Nervous?
- Why would I be nervous?

01:42.160 --> 01:44.594
Because we're going to school
with, like, 300 Lukes...

01:44.760 --> 01:46.751
...minus the redeeming social qualities.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.031
I got it. Sorry.
You meant you were nervous.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.878
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous. I'm just not going.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.429
You have to go. You own the school.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.716
What about Kickoff Carnival?
You're the social chair.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.594
Let's see. Be humiliated
in front of the entire school...

02:03.760 --> 02:06.035
...or hire someone
to do balloon animals?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.475
Hire the guy who makes
the balloon octopus.

02:08.639 --> 02:13.156
So your boyfriend cheated on you,
and, yes, you almost died in Mexico.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.992
And the scandal with your dad...

02:15.160 --> 02:17.390
If you're trying
to make me feel better...

02:17.560 --> 02:21.553
Okay. The point is, there's
no such thing as bad publicity.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.518
- Is that something burning?
- Okay, so...

02:25.680 --> 02:30.549
...new oven. Haven't quite figured out
how to make French toast.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.234
Not in the oven
would be a good place to start.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.392
Since no one will hire me,
I've got plenty of time...

02:36.560 --> 02:38.869
...I'm gonna go out and buy a cookbook.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.793
Come on! It's good, they're crunchy.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.394
- See?
- No, thanks.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.154
I don't know who I'm more
worried about here.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.519
I think it's safe to say that
this year is going to be different.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.514
- Maybe this year will be different.
- That's the mantra every year.

02:58.680 --> 03:02.912
And every year some big water-polo
player pees in one of my shoes.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.312
Just kidding. They pee in both.
Ryan has Mr. Schmidt for pre-calc.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.434
- What's wrong with Mr. Schmidt?
- Nothing. Say hi to his mole for me.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.670
At least you have each other.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.196
- Very wise, Dad.
- Thank you, son.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.908
We're doomed.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.677
The master race has been perfected
and they all go to our school.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.033
Hey, fellas.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.949
All right, don't get
your Speedos in a bunch.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.680
- This is a nightmare.
- This is a nightmare.

04:15.840 --> 04:19.230
- I bet, like, no one even knows.
- Are you kidding?

04:19.399 --> 04:22.631
- I heard she died down there.
- She looks pretty good for a dead girl.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.270
Hey, whores!
Why don't you go work another corner.

04:26.440 --> 04:30.228
Summ, maybe I should go home.
Help my dad unpack.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.710
Coop, that is as bad as it's gonna get.
I spoke too soon.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.316
Hello, Summer. What does
your schedule look like today?

04:37.480 --> 04:39.471
- Full.
- Really?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.631
- A friendly face.
- How's it going?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.597
- Not good. You?
- Worse.

04:43.760 --> 04:48.550
So why don't we just get out of here?
Right now. Go down to the pier.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.871
I can't. Dean Kim would call my dad.
Or worse, my mom.

04:52.040 --> 04:56.318
- Okay. How about after school?
- I'm chairing the carnival committee.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.678
- I know. I've been looking for an excuse.
- I think you found one.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.479
- I'll meet you out front.
- Something to look forward to.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.200
Coop! Can we go, please?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.868
Hey. Could we maybe talk or...?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.638
Stay away from her.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.836
How?
We all go to the same school.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.592
You should've thought about that...

05:19.760 --> 05:23.036
...before hooking up with one
of her best friends! Ass!

05:26.240 --> 05:29.949
- You okay?
- Yeah. I just have to get used to it.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.153
This, I guess.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.114
- But we're still on, right?
- Yeah. Something to look forward to.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.678
Coop!

05:40.840 --> 05:42.831
See you, Summer.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.233
Slowly I thaw her icy heart.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.310
- Look at you.
- Lf I must.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.679
- New suit. New scent. New look.
- I feel like this is heading somewhere.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.751
- New girlfriend.
- And there it is.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.319
You're still all bent out of...

06:06.760 --> 06:12.232
Oh, God! I should've found
an attractive co-worker years ago.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.789
- It was a figure of speech.
- Rachel's attractive?

06:14.960 --> 06:16.951
Is that her name? It's context.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.159
Only, you know, in relation to which
she invokes amorous feelings...

06:21.320 --> 06:25.108
...in my far more, extremely more,
attractive wife.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.436
Good answer.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.912
- Mornings used to be our time.
- I remember them well.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.877
What happened?

06:47.440 --> 06:51.353
Work happened.
Just hang on one sec.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.990
Wait a minute. I can't get it.
Hang on one sec.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.079
Just hold on. I got it.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.468
Wait.

07:01.800 --> 07:06.396
How did she know?
You're not gonna answer it, are you?

07:12.040 --> 07:14.235
It's my dad.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.030
Hey, Rachel.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.713
Hi, Dad.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.555
So if you'd care to join me
for lunch today...

07:24.720 --> 07:26.551
...I can arrange for an empty chair.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.109
There's nothing but empty chairs
at your table.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.554
Seth Cohen?

07:31.600 --> 07:34.273
Anna! Hey, how are you doing?

07:34.440 --> 07:36.271
Excuse me, we were talking here.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.512
So insulting him
counts as conversation?

07:39.680 --> 07:43.798
If it doesn't, then we've never spoken.
Remember Anna from Pittsburgh?

07:43.960 --> 07:48.476
- How could I forget?
- We're still on for lunch today, right?

07:48.640 --> 07:52.030
- She probably didn't even hear me.
- Seth, what are you doing?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.839
I thought you got past
this whole Summer thing at cotillion.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.276
Right. And I know it seems like
not a lot of progress has been made...

07:58.440 --> 08:01.830
...but I have to tell you... Yeah, not that
much progress has been made.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.869
Despite all my best judgments,
I cannot not like her.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.634
- You're such a boy.
- Well, whatever.

08:09.800 --> 08:14.874
- I'm nothing but available for that girl.
- All right. Right there.

08:15.040 --> 08:19.352
That's your problem. Girls like to be
chased by guys that aren't into them.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.556
That sounds a little bit
like a game to me...

08:21.720 --> 08:23.950
...and I don't really like to play games.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.554
Unless we're talking about
Saturday-night Jenga...

08:26.720 --> 08:29.712
...a little Magic: The Gathering.
I love Magic: The Gathering.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.837
Maybe you just don't know how to play.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.037
- Well, you're a girl, right?
- Yeah.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.589
- And we're friends, right?
- Sure.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.955
Then train me in the ways of women.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.917
I don't understand chicks like Summer.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.798
I'll teach you how to play Jenga.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.957
- You really like her?
- Since I was 10.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.519
Fine.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.117
- But I make no promises.
- Trust me, I cannot do any worse.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.192
That I trust.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.833
You're my girl.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.917
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.958
What were you doing this morning
when I called? You sounded...

09:08.120 --> 09:09.348
Did I wake you?

09:09.520 --> 09:12.478
- I was spending some time with my wife.
- Yeah? How'd that go?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.632
- Well, I got to work on time.
- Too bad.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.951
It might be a while before your wife
is in the mood for love.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.395
Yeah? Something you know I don't?

09:22.560 --> 09:25.996
I know lots that you don't,
but in this case...

09:26.160 --> 09:28.196
...are you familiar
with the Balboa Wetlands?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.476
Yeah, the largest coastal wetlands
in California.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.918
Home to the blue heron,
the brown pelican and the swamp rose.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.308
Right.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.358
The wetlands are key
to water quality in the county.

09:39.520 --> 09:43.308
- Not to mention, they're kind of pretty.
- Naturally, they must be destroyed.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.109
The Balboa Heights are 250 acres
of land that sit above said wetlands.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.556
- Every developer's after the Heights.
- Somebody got it.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.030
And they're looking to tear it up,
put in condos, a golf course.

09:54.200 --> 09:57.954
Thank God. The lack of golf courses
around here, it's tragic.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.510
This is a policy-changing,
career-making piece of litigation.

10:01.680 --> 10:06.674
A tree-hugging crusader, like yourself,
would kill for a case like this.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.400
- And you want to share this with me.
- Yes.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.959
Why?

10:17.960 --> 10:21.157
Oh, my wife's company is the plaintiff.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.550
It's her father's company.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.992
Why even tempt me with this?

10:27.160 --> 10:30.152
It's a conflict of interest.
I'm not even sure it'd be ethical.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.074
The client, the Balboa Land Trust,
not only waived the conflict of interest...

10:34.240 --> 10:36.800
...they insisted you take the case.

10:36.960 --> 10:40.999
Your politics, your passion,
your dislike for your father-in-law.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.948
- You're the ideal advocate.
- My wife will have a different spin on it.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.473
You came to this firm...

10:46.640 --> 10:49.552
...because we have the resources
to help you make a difference.

10:49.720 --> 10:53.679
They're gonna teach this in law school.
So, what's it gonna be?

10:53.840 --> 10:56.593
Your sex life? Or the swamp rose?

11:09.440 --> 11:12.955
Did you know that
she overdosed on Vicodin?

11:40.560 --> 11:43.120
You are not quitting your post
as social chair, Marissa.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.636
You were elected by the students,
you've held the position for two years.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.713
I know, Dr. Kim. But that was before
everything that happened this summer.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.077
I understand you are going
through a lot of change right now...

11:54.240 --> 11:57.312
...but you're a leader here at Harbor,
that doesn't have to change.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.756
You're a wonderful example.
Students look up to you.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.433
Not anymore.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.878
Putting aside the issue of how walking
away from your responsibilities...

12:07.040 --> 12:10.271
...will affect your college transcript...

12:10.440 --> 12:14.149
...people are always going to talk.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.199
You may as well give them
something good to talk about.

12:18.360 --> 12:22.148
Don't disappear, Marissa.
This is your school, your life.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.197
Your future.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.599
Hey, what are you doing?

12:28.760 --> 12:30.512
You never told me
about summer reading.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.908
Who does summer reading?

12:32.080 --> 12:36.198
- Apparently, everyone in my class.
- Oh. Yeah. Sorry about that one.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.477
Anna here has convinced me
to join <i>The Plank</i>, the literary magazine.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.552
I needed an extracurricular activity,
and apparently...

12:42.720 --> 12:44.711
...you don't have to wear a
sports bra.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.269
It's appealing on many levels.
Plus I feel...

12:47.440 --> 12:50.000
...I have a few limericks
to share with the world.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.628
Have fun.
I'm gonna hang with Marissa.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.030
School might not suck this year.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.159
Hey. I have to plan
this carnival thing after all.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.072
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.151
I talked to the dean, and...

13:03.320 --> 13:06.915
...I think getting involved in school again
might not be a bad idea.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.197
- I know, that sounds lame.
- Yeah. No, it's cool.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.318
- So...
- Can we reschedule?

13:14.480 --> 13:16.436
- Absolutely.
- What about the carnival?

13:16.600 --> 13:19.239
I'll save you a ride on the Ferris wheel.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.710
No Ferris wheels. I don't do heights.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.152
- But we'll figure something out.
- Are you sure you're gonna be...?

13:28.320 --> 13:32.359
I'm fine. I just got a lot of reading to do.
Like 500 years of it.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.511
Okay. So I'll see you.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.075
- Morning.
- I didn't hear you come in last night.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.071
I didn't want to wake you.
You look nice.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.879
Dad's demanding a company breakfast.
Some kind of crisis.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.952
If this is how it's gonna be,
after a couple of weeks of work...

14:10.120 --> 14:13.032
...we're gonna be like...
- Two ships passing in the morning.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.952
What have they got you working on?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.918
A big high-profile case.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.310
How about lunch today? I'll pay.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.152
No, actually, you can pay.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.392
You're the one that's working
on a high-profile case.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.198
How about Friday?

14:27.360 --> 14:30.557
I'll have my people call your people.
I love you.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.631
I love you too.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.718
Hey, kid.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.518
- How did school go for you?
- Fine. Just behind.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.910
After one day? Nice work.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.913
It's brutal. You're brave to face
those preppy little savages.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.308
I mean the teachers.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.756
I don't think it was a good idea,
me in private school.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.959
- You're one of their smartest kids.
- It's not the work. It's just...

15:05.120 --> 15:08.476
...everybody's got something,
except me.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.154
- Well, you got Seth.
- Seth's got his women.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.432
Seth Cohen?

15:15.320 --> 15:17.276
Okay. So...

15:17.440 --> 15:19.556
Really?

15:21.440 --> 15:24.750
So you need something.
An activity. A sport.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.470
- Ladies.
- Don Juan, we're trying to find...

15:27.640 --> 15:29.835
...an extracurricular activity for Ryan.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.719
- Okay.
- Harbor's got a great archery program...

15:32.880 --> 15:34.279
Archery, no.
Absolutely not.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.668
Fencing?

15:35.840 --> 15:39.355
What century are you in? Open your
mind. This isn't me we're talking about.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.751
With Ryan, we have an opportunity
to have a real athlete in the family.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.148
Somebody to achieve...

15:44.320 --> 15:47.232
...all that your Jewishness has
prevented me from accomplishing.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.630
- I always wanted to play soccer.
- I used to play.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.031
- Done.
- Glad I could help.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.759
I didn't get around
to getting those cookbooks.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.957
I guess it's better
to play it safe, then.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.759
So how's sleeping on the sofa?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.353
It's fine.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.909
- It's just temporary.
- I can handle it.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.071
Did you talk to your mom?

16:15.160 --> 16:17.594
I'm sorry about all this, sweetheart.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.718
- I just wish you would've told me.
- I know, I know.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.189
But things will be different now.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.874
Hey, don't get too excited.

16:26.040 --> 16:30.158
The phone company is installing
an actual phone line.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.117
A very big day.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.199
- Hey, Mr. Cooper.
- Luke.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.193
So is this your new place?
Looks great.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.639
- Not buying it, Luke.
- Right. Can I talk to Marissa?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.756
- No. You can't.
- Come on, it's me.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.558
If I could talk to her...

16:47.720 --> 16:52.191
Yeah, she told me what happened,
and she doesn't want to talk right now.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.874
Come on. If anybody knows
about being in the doghouse...

16:55.040 --> 16:57.031
Don't say it.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.391
What can I do?

17:00.560 --> 17:02.630
You can leave.

17:04.119 --> 17:07.396
Well, tell her sorry.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.667
Okay.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.473
Thanks.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.990
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.878
- How did it go with the carnival?
- Oh, very exciting.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.632
If I get out of my meeting early...

17:31.800 --> 17:34.030
We're voting on cotton candy
versus funnel cakes.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.670
- Cotton candy, no question.
- My thoughts exactly.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.515
But I can't today. I got soccer practice.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.399
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm gonna try out.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.314
I figure getting involved in school
might not be such a bad idea.

17:48.480 --> 17:52.712
Yeah. Plus, now we both get out
at 5, right? Meet you in the quad.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.996
See you then.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.278
- Hello. Is this seat taken?
- It is now.

18:06.440 --> 18:07.668
Cool.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.792
You can sit here
if you want, Summer.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.308
Thanks.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.390
Seth, come sit here by me.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.438
Are you sure? You don't mind
one cheek on, one cheek off?

18:32.600 --> 18:34.318
Sit!

18:36.480 --> 18:38.789
Sitting.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.710
Oh, my God!
Okay, so tell me about Tahiti.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.031
- Oh, it was incredible.
- Anna just sailed to Tahiti.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.317
Sailing is, like,
so not the fastest way to get anywhere.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.473
If you'd flown,
you would've gotten there a lot sooner.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.915
You should be on the debate team.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.995
- Nice office.
- It came furnished.

19:14.400 --> 19:19.110
- I brought you lunch.
- Well, it's not a lump of coal.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.430
- When were you going to tell me?
- Soon.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.160
Not soon enough.
I signed a deposition this morning.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.878
Oh, honey.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.838
I'm not even sure
if I'm gonna take this case.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.752
There is no case!

19:31.920 --> 19:35.595
You're talking about destroying one of
the world's most productive ecosystems.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.877
It's like selling off the rainforest
to profit a few individuals...

19:39.040 --> 19:41.508
...and asking generations
of others to pay for it.

19:41.680 --> 19:47.118
We have proposed to protect 350 acres
of wildlife refuge and a natural park.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.670
You'll still add 30% more traffic
and 10 tons of air pollution daily.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.071
Not to mention
what you'll do to the water supply.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.276
- You're gonna take this.
- No...

19:56.440 --> 19:58.158
Sandy, it isn't even ethical.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.276
I feel comfortable comparing ethics
with your father.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.398
Well, as long as you're comfortable.
I gotta go.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.633
I gotta keep this off my father's radar.
He's going to lose his mind.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.039
All right, move! Don't wait for it!

20:14.520 --> 20:16.192
Hey. You Atwood?

20:16.360 --> 20:18.590
- What position you coming out for?
- Striker.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.833
You see that kid out front?
That's Luke, the captain and striker.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.031
Let's go! Show me something!

20:28.000 --> 20:31.356
Hey, Ward!
You got a little competition!

20:35.840 --> 20:38.593
Thanks.
Tomorrow we'll figure out the parking.

20:38.760 --> 20:42.389
Make sure the band's booked.
No last-second surprises.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.678
We need to talk.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.956
You do not want to hear
what I have to say.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.678
- Yes, I do.
- No.

21:00.840 --> 21:04.310
All you want is for me to tell you
that everything's okay now. It's not.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.152
I know, and I'm so sorry.

21:06.320 --> 21:10.154
I don't care how you feel
or what you're going through.

21:10.320 --> 21:13.357
- Because you didn't care about me.
- That's not true.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.752
I slept with you. Then you slept
with one of my best friends.

21:17.920 --> 21:22.550
I waited for you and you lied to me.
You humiliated me.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.959
Marissa...

21:32.960 --> 21:34.791
It's just...

21:37.040 --> 21:38.553
I'm so sorry.

21:40.680 --> 21:44.719
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to not be able to talk to you?

21:46.120 --> 21:49.999
- You think it's easy for me?
- Let's just start over.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.119
Please?

21:54.520 --> 21:57.114
I don't know what I'd do without you.

22:03.040 --> 22:07.591
Just because I ruined everything,
it doesn't mean I didn't love you...

22:07.760 --> 22:10.035
...because I did.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.513
I do.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.513
You know what the worst part is?

22:37.680 --> 22:40.478
If I hadn't caught you...

22:40.640 --> 22:42.517
...I'd still love you too.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.911
I gotta go.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.192
I know that look.

23:03.360 --> 23:08.275
I was trying to keep this from my dad,
and now it's on the front page.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.671
I thought we could settle this privately.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.434
- This was not to go to the press.
- It's your firm!

23:15.600 --> 23:18.478
And now the entire
community knows we're fighting.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.317
Well, I guess
they got the story straight.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.759
- What are you doing?
- Morning ritual, Ryan.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.639
- Coffee, bagel, Arts & Leisure.
- You have a morning ritual?

23:32.800 --> 23:34.870
Something I've been crafting
for a while.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.948
So, what's up, dude?

23:38.120 --> 23:40.759
How's life? We never talk anymore.
Who are you?

23:40.920 --> 23:46.472
- We had dinner 12 hours ago.
- Fine. Keep it all bottled up.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.713
- What was that?
- Nothing.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.475
That wasn't nothing. I saw
thoughts forming and words percolating.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.358
It's just...

23:56.200 --> 23:59.749
- Never mind.
- Come on! What was that, dude?

24:00.600 --> 24:05.071
Last night, I saw Marissa with Luke.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.150
- Making out?
- Making up.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.231
Luke was crying.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.156
Luke was crying?

24:14.880 --> 24:19.396
- That doesn't sound like anything.
- It didn't sound like nothing.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.551
Looked like they were
getting back together.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.030
So ask her about it.
If nothing's going on, she'll tell you.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.273
- Do not tell him!
- Shouldn't I just be honest?

24:29.440 --> 24:33.558
Never. You guys haven't even gone
on a date yet. You'll freak him out.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.790
Trust me, what he doesn't know
won't hurt you.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.553
What happened to you last night?
I tried calling.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.632
Sorry. I got slammed last night.
I'm behind.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.518
After two days?

24:52.440 --> 24:54.510
What did you do?

24:55.640 --> 24:57.870
Nothing. My meeting went long.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.269
- How'd it go?
- Good. I think it'll be good.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.677
What did you do after?

25:04.840 --> 25:07.593
- After I couldn't find you, I went home.
- Sorry.

25:07.760 --> 25:11.639
Yeah, but you've got soccer
practice later. Maybe I'll stop by.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.236
I gotta get to class. I'll see you.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.111
- I mean, ew!
- That's my girl.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.272
- Cohen, you're a good dissector.
- Hands of a surgeon.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.749
It's decided, then.
You'll be my lab partner.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.797
You can write up the lab reports.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.190
Actually, Seth already has a partner.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.235
He's promised himself to me, right?

25:50.400 --> 25:52.470
Yes. I am betrothed.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.074
Good.

25:56.760 --> 26:00.992
She wanted to be my lab partner.
You're supposed to help me get her.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.720
Watch and learn, Cohen.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.472
Follow my lead.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.073
Scalpel!

26:12.000 --> 26:13.433
Where shall we begin?

26:13.960 --> 26:15.393
The heart.

26:23.160 --> 26:26.436
Well, Sanford, you're all anybody's
talking about around here.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.433
Did you bring me into this firm
because of this case?

26:29.600 --> 26:32.592
We didn't have this case
when we hired you. Don't worry.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.036
You've already convinced everyone
that you're really torn.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.395
This could go
to the state supreme court.

26:38.560 --> 26:42.838
Yeah. And I know I could win.
It's a question of what I'm gonna lose.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.270
Well, if your marriage
can't survive this...

26:47.800 --> 26:50.314
...what kind of marriage is it?

26:52.120 --> 26:55.669
Hey, Atwood, good!
Good! Take a shot!

26:55.840 --> 26:58.070
- All right.
- Good hold, guys.

26:58.880 --> 27:02.395
All right, let's keep it moving.
Let's go! Line up!

27:02.560 --> 27:03.788
Hi.

27:06.560 --> 27:10.394
Sorry about yesterday.
That was kind of intense.

27:10.560 --> 27:15.475
The last time I cried was when
Macaulay Culkin died in <i>My Girl</i>.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.712
Yeah, the bee stings.
You were a mess.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.159
Kick! All right, good, good.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.709
All right, guys, let's go.

27:25.960 --> 27:29.589
- Hey, Ward! Get over here!
- I will...

27:32.160 --> 27:34.549
Sorry, coach.
I had to tape up my ankle.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.633
Excuse me.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.429
All right, we're finally all together?
I wanna see some hustle now.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.314
Hey! Illegal!

27:53.600 --> 27:55.955
Get in my office. Right now!

27:57.120 --> 27:59.031
Don't put any weight on it.

27:59.680 --> 28:00.908
Nice job.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.719
What's your problem, dude?

28:15.120 --> 28:17.759
How was soccer?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.434
So, Pops, how's the new job?

28:28.880 --> 28:31.235
Hey, Mom, I...

28:32.920 --> 28:35.070
I'm just going to be quietly eating now.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.393
Hey.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.116
What was that about?

28:55.280 --> 28:57.350
- What?
- You attacked him.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.557
He beat me to the ball.
It was a clean tackle.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.314
- Why are you lying to me?
- Why are you lying to me?

29:04.120 --> 29:06.509
- What are you talking about?
- You and Luke.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.036
- I saw you yesterday. I heard everything.
- I didn't know what to say.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.474
Why not tell me the truth?

29:11.640 --> 29:15.110
Why didn't you just tell me,
instead of hurting him?

29:15.280 --> 29:18.317
- You're as bad as he is.
- I don't need any more lies.

29:18.480 --> 29:22.155
I didn't lie to you. What happened
was between me and Luke.

29:22.320 --> 29:26.871
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Right, it has nothing to do with me.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.149
It just isn't gonna happen.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.595
No, it's not.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.999
Your coach called.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.798
He wants to suspend you
for two games.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.791
- Great.
- He thinks you got talent.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.712
He also thinks your attitude sucks.

30:03.880 --> 30:07.111
- It does.
- Sit down and listen to me.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.034
You can stand if you want,
but you know how lawyers love to talk.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.039
You don't need this blowout
on the soccer field...

30:25.200 --> 30:27.634
...to turn into a suspension from school.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.473
- This school can do great things.
- For Seth, not me.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.234
You're angry. I know that.
I don't blame you.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.995
Every day at that school,
you're gonna run into spoiled rich kids...

30:37.160 --> 30:39.116
...whose ass you are gonna
want to kick.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.033
You've gotta find a way
to work it out right now.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.589
Let's forget about suspension.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.318
We're always one mistake
away from...

30:50.280 --> 30:52.475
...from someone taking you from us.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.995
You know, Seth was never
really big on organized sports.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.349
I'd love to see you play.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.554
Go to some of your games.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.990
And women usually find
stark brutality so romantic.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.594
- I messed up.
- Yeah, well.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.513
In my experience,
you should always apologize.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.355
Even if you've done nothing wrong,
your shoes get peed in so much less.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.479
- That was a metaphor.
- Apologize. Right. And to Luke?

31:45.640 --> 31:48.677
That crybaby? No, man.
He can drown in his own tears.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.717
They're all the same.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.872
It's too bad, because I could tell
you really liked him.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.428
Hi.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.078
- Do you mind? Can we...?
- We have to get to class. Come on.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.955
I do love Mr. Solomon Burke.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.588
Hey.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.799
I was...

32:55.280 --> 32:57.510
I was gonna bring you
a bouquet of swamp roses...

32:57.680 --> 33:00.240
...but apparently they're endangered.

33:02.720 --> 33:06.872
I'm gonna take it. I gotta. I'm sorry.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.156
It's who you married.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.231
I know.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.073
You know, I've been
pissing you off for years.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.196
Why stop now?

33:18.160 --> 33:22.358
My father, my husband...
It's gonna be a long year.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.037
Could be a couple of years.

33:27.800 --> 33:32.157
Yeah. Well, I couldn't be married
to a man who wasn't a man.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.271
I'm all man.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.352
We'll get through this.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.752
There's a reason why we're together.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.432
I have that suspicion.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.278
Okay.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.670
Okay?

33:53.840 --> 33:55.068
Okay.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.028
Okay.

34:06.080 --> 34:09.356
- The kids are at that carnival.
- I heard that rumor.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.472
- Are you getting out?
- Are you getting in?

34:14.159 --> 34:15.991
Maybe.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.230
Maybe. Okay.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.914
- Oh, my God.
- Why do you keep this thing on?

34:23.080 --> 34:25.036
Emergencies.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.399
It's my dad. And it's an emergency.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.472
Hey, Dad.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.469
Rachel, hi.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.391
- Lf only Skee-Ball were a school sport.
- A boy can dream.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.312
- Let's see you take a shot.
- I'll pass.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.630
Take one shot!
Take a shot. It's very easy.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.393
Okay? Concentrate.
Lean to the left a little bit.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.710
- Any luck finding Marissa?
- No sign of her. You guys?

34:56.880 --> 34:59.030
Nothing. We have to let
Anna concentrate...

34:59.200 --> 35:01.350
...as she dares to step up to the master.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.438
Okay. Clearly, you're a lesbian.

35:07.600 --> 35:12.355
I'm gonna go trade in my tickets
for some cash prizes.

35:12.520 --> 35:16.069
Hey, do you think I should get Summer
something? What would she like?

35:17.840 --> 35:19.796
I can figure it out.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.918
Seth doesn't understand
the whole hard-to-get strategy.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.355
- That's because he's not.
- Oh.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.029
Why are you helping him
with Summer?

35:31.200 --> 35:32.633
Why not?

35:34.720 --> 35:37.439
Seth doesn't see me that way.

35:37.600 --> 35:41.639
When he looks at Summer,
he sees lips, hair and boobs.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.511
When he looks at me, he sees...

35:46.880 --> 35:48.871
...a lab partner.

35:49.040 --> 35:51.474
- We're friends.
- And you're gonna let that slide?

35:54.080 --> 35:55.672
Anna...

35:57.520 --> 36:02.071
...guys wanna be chased by girls
who aren't interested in them.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.831
Come on!

36:05.920 --> 36:08.275
Summer, it's right here.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.873
So do girls.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.156
She's heading for the Ferris wheel.
Gotta go.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.912
Good luck.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.075
I'm sorry about yesterday.

36:27.080 --> 36:31.153
Actually, I'm glad we came.
It's not half as bad as last time.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.517
- You're going with me.
- Yeah, okay. Let's go.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.712
Do you mind?

36:50.880 --> 36:53.394
Not getting involved.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.959
- What are you doing?
- I wanna talk.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.519
I thought you were afraid of heights.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.989
But this is important.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.108
Oh, boy.

37:11.280 --> 37:16.195
Look. I said some things last night,
and I just want you...

37:18.280 --> 37:19.793
Whoa.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.558
- What's going on?
- We're stopped.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.756
Why are we stopped?

37:25.920 --> 37:29.276
Keep them up there a few minutes.
Let them work it out.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.915
You are the master.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.310
Cohen, there's something
I wanna tell you.

37:34.480 --> 37:37.358
All right. More advice.
I'm ready, bring it.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.877
Was this all part of the plan?

38:03.680 --> 38:05.955
Because it looks like it's working.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.951
Yeah.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.759
It was all part of the plan.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.557
So are you gonna go?

38:16.440 --> 38:19.398
Yeah. Thank you.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.273
I got this for you.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.719
It's all I could get with my tickets.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.108
Thanks.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.833
Hi, Summer.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.159
What's going on?

38:53.240 --> 38:54.878
Coop's stuck on the Ferris wheel...

38:55.040 --> 38:58.157
...and I was looking for someone
to go on the Tilt-A-Whirl with me.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.515
I'll go on it with you.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.268
Okay. I may vomit.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.271
I like those odds.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.674
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.950
You had to get
the cheap Ferris wheel!

39:18.120 --> 39:20.759
What kind of carnival is this, Cooper?

39:26.040 --> 39:27.359
Okay.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.759
Look...

39:30.440 --> 39:33.273
I don't talk a lot about stuff...

39:33.440 --> 39:36.159
...and I really don't trust people.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.239
But I trust you.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.951
And I want to make it, this, work.

39:45.120 --> 39:49.830
No matter what. If we ever get down,
maybe we could talk about it.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.878
- Who knows when that'll be?
- Please don't say that.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.833
Maybe you just need something
to take your mind off of it.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.230
Fifty feet in the air,
how do you expect me to...?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.353
One more time.
