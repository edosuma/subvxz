WEBVTT

00:01.173 --> 00:02.485
- This is like old times.

00:02.519 --> 00:04.107
We're going back to Orange.

00:04.142 --> 00:05.660
We're bringing Bozek.
- Yep.

00:05.695 --> 00:07.041
- It's like
the band's back together.

00:07.076 --> 00:08.249
- I know.

00:08.284 --> 00:09.699
- We're right down
the street from the shop.

00:09.733 --> 00:10.976
Are we gonna be, like,
territorial today?

00:11.011 --> 00:12.322
'Cause this is our area?

00:12.357 --> 00:14.048
Is that what you mean?

00:14.083 --> 00:15.774
- Maybe.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.603
Gross.

00:17.638 --> 00:18.915
You know how
when you're talking

00:18.949 --> 00:20.744
and then you know that
things have gone too far?

00:20.779 --> 00:22.815
Like, you have to know
where the line is.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.576
We have now found the line.

00:24.610 --> 00:26.060
- They should make
the line bigger.

00:29.581 --> 00:31.307
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:31.341 --> 00:33.688
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:33.723 --> 00:35.173
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:35.207 --> 00:37.175
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:37.209 --> 00:38.521
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:38.555 --> 00:39.867
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:39.901 --> 00:41.558
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:41.593 --> 00:43.077
- You shut your face.

00:43.112 --> 00:45.252
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:45.286 --> 00:46.425
- We're back, baby!

00:49.463 --> 00:51.258
- Orange County.

00:51.292 --> 00:53.018
This is probably the nicest
area we've ever gone

00:53.053 --> 00:54.192
to an auction at, by the way.

00:54.226 --> 00:55.193
- It actually is.

00:55.227 --> 00:56.435
- We've definitely
been bamboozled

00:56.470 --> 00:57.781
with a couple trash units.

00:57.816 --> 00:59.714
Today let's get back
to what we used to like.

00:59.749 --> 01:02.959
Let's focus on clothes.
Vintage that we love.

01:02.993 --> 01:04.926
- And I think our budget
should be $20.

01:06.618 --> 01:09.241
- Most people think
that marysfinds.com

01:09.276 --> 01:11.278
is just for treasures
and trinkets.

01:11.312 --> 01:15.937
Well, it is, but in addition,
there's lots of other stuff,

01:15.972 --> 01:18.906
like, you know,
whimsicals, oddities,

01:18.940 --> 01:21.667
knickknacks, doodads,
whatchamacallits,

01:21.702 --> 01:23.428
trinkets, tchotchkes,

01:23.462 --> 01:24.567
gems.

01:24.601 --> 01:26.465
You name it, I got it.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.949
There's a huge market
for finds.

01:27.984 --> 01:29.917
In fact, I'm almost
out of them.

01:29.951 --> 01:32.299
I'm always on the hunt
for more stuff.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.338
- Hoo, Orange County.

01:37.373 --> 01:41.066
Hey.
Might be a lucky day today.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.137
Either way,
I'm buying something.

01:44.449 --> 01:45.691
- Cute hat.

01:45.726 --> 01:47.107
- Ooh, Emily's here.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.211
- I haven't seen you
in forever.

01:48.246 --> 01:49.730
- Is this what it feels like
to be in jail?

01:49.764 --> 01:51.076
- Yeah.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.629
- The best friend love
right there.

01:52.664 --> 01:54.976
Hi, Emily.
Hi, Mary.

01:55.011 --> 01:56.668
- We're happy to see you.

01:56.702 --> 01:57.841
We--

01:57.876 --> 02:00.085
Can we prison
We can prison

02:00.120 --> 02:02.708
Mary's like, No, we can't.
All right, done.

02:02.743 --> 02:04.814
- Yeah.

02:04.848 --> 02:05.953
â™ª

02:07.092 --> 02:08.542
- All right, ladies, well,

02:08.576 --> 02:11.131
I see, uh, the energy is there.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.442
That was weird.

02:12.477 --> 02:14.858
Mary just touched me
like I had some cooties.

02:14.893 --> 02:16.722
I came to show them some love
and they were like,

02:16.757 --> 02:18.621
Mm-mm.
Not having it.

02:18.655 --> 02:20.174
It's all right, though,
we ain't gotta be friends.

02:20.209 --> 02:22.935
.
- Edwina.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.385
both: Hey.

02:24.420 --> 02:26.249
- That's Bozek.

02:26.284 --> 02:27.388
- We've never met you.

02:27.423 --> 02:28.872
- Everybody knows Bozek.

02:28.907 --> 02:30.391
- You don't know Bozek,
you really don't know anything.

02:30.426 --> 02:32.186
- We've been to all these
auctions and never seen you.

02:32.221 --> 02:33.567
- Retired for a little bit.

02:33.601 --> 02:35.569
with the rest of us.

02:35.603 --> 02:37.950
- Literally.

02:37.985 --> 02:40.436
- We brought Bozek along today
because we want to buy big.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.265
Bozek doesn't know that yet.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.439
But he's about to.

02:43.473 --> 02:44.819
What's going on?

02:44.854 --> 02:46.545
- No, I told you,
you guys are like those chicks

02:46.580 --> 02:48.306
in high school
that everybody's afraid of.

02:48.340 --> 02:49.376
- You know what they haven't
seen, though,

02:49.410 --> 02:50.825
is what we did to our back

02:50.860 --> 02:52.033
?

02:52.068 --> 02:54.277
You put brand-new letters
on an old

02:54.312 --> 02:56.176
- Right, stepping up fashion.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.349
- Why don't you get yourself
a new jacket?

02:57.384 --> 02:58.661
Without holes in it.

02:58.695 --> 03:00.732
- This is what the kids
are doing these days.

03:00.766 --> 03:03.079
- Oh, you should totally
rip holes in your jacket too.

03:03.113 --> 03:04.080
all: Yeah.

03:04.114 --> 03:05.737
- We got scissors in the car.

03:05.771 --> 03:08.222
- Edwina's nice and all, but if
she tries to cut up my jacket,

03:08.257 --> 03:09.534
I'm gonna have to take
the earrings off.

03:09.568 --> 03:10.845
How many units are there?

03:10.880 --> 03:13.986
- I don't know what that means.

03:14.021 --> 03:15.609
- Anything old, they've been
here for a long time.

03:15.643 --> 03:16.610
That's osky.

03:16.644 --> 03:18.128
both: No, "osky."

03:18.163 --> 03:19.302
- Osky.

03:19.337 --> 03:21.511
- Yeah, where do I look
these words up?

03:21.546 --> 03:23.375
- Good afternoon, everybody,
thank you for coming out today

03:23.410 --> 03:24.756
to My Self Storage Space.

03:24.790 --> 03:25.860
My name is Emily.

03:25.895 --> 03:27.103
I'm gonna be
your auctioneer today.

03:27.137 --> 03:28.518
Once I open the door
to the storage locker,

03:28.553 --> 03:30.106
you cannot go in,
and you can't touch anything,

03:30.140 --> 03:31.107
but you will all
get a chance to look,

03:31.141 --> 03:32.177
and once you all take a look,

03:32.212 --> 03:33.523
then I'm gonna go
ahead and sell it.

03:33.558 --> 03:36.181
And if you have cash
in your pocket or your purse,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.803
you can buy today.
This is a cash-only auction.

03:37.838 --> 03:39.115
So if you guys are ready,
I am too.

03:39.149 --> 03:40.254
Let's go.

03:40.289 --> 03:42.256
- Whoo!

03:42.291 --> 03:43.913
- You guys got to get patches
on the front, though,

03:43.947 --> 03:45.984
with your name,
then you could have, like,

03:46.018 --> 03:50.264
"Auction Captain,"
"Rogue Leader."

03:50.299 --> 03:52.266
I don't want to be
a part of that.

03:52.301 --> 03:53.578
- Here we go.

03:53.612 --> 03:55.304
5x5.

03:55.338 --> 03:56.546
- I'm gonna be sick.

03:58.755 --> 04:01.896
- I don't like that.
It's not for me.

04:01.931 --> 04:02.932
- Ew.

04:02.966 --> 04:04.692
- I need to know
what's in there.

04:04.727 --> 04:06.349
- Tampons.

04:06.384 --> 04:08.524
- Tampons.

04:08.558 --> 04:10.284
- Tampons!
- Those are extra.

04:10.319 --> 04:11.354
- I've got nothing
to say about this one.

04:11.389 --> 04:12.355
- Found your clothes unit.

04:12.390 --> 04:14.184
- Shabby chic.
- Osky.

04:14.219 --> 04:16.014
- Oh, this is a osky.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.430
Ran through osky.
- Jeans.

04:18.465 --> 04:19.742
- Tons of clothes,
which is good.

04:19.776 --> 04:21.537
- Backgammon.
- A vintage luggage we love.

04:21.571 --> 04:22.607
What do you think?

04:22.641 --> 04:24.160
- I love the color
of that suitcase.

04:24.194 --> 04:26.231
- Mm-hmm.
- Step right up, my friend.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.784
- Ew.

04:27.819 --> 04:30.787
Um, you know what doesn't
sell on marysfinds.com?

04:30.822 --> 04:32.582
Crusty plush.

04:32.617 --> 04:33.963
- There's a hat
right there for you.

04:33.997 --> 04:35.344
- All righty, guys, here we go.

04:35.378 --> 04:36.621
How about $10?

04:36.655 --> 04:38.657
- $10.

04:38.692 --> 04:40.452
- Yes, it was.

04:40.487 --> 04:42.316
- 10, okay, now.

04:44.801 --> 04:46.458
- Can I bum
one of those tampons?

04:46.493 --> 04:48.702
- Sold it to you, $10.
The Vegas Ladies got it.

04:48.736 --> 04:49.910
both: Yeah!

04:49.944 --> 04:51.601
- Ten bucks
and free lady products?

04:51.636 --> 04:53.189
This was a deal.

04:53.223 --> 04:55.191
- Right this way, you guys.
Keep going down the hall.

04:55.225 --> 04:56.192
- Let's just dig through
and see

04:56.226 --> 04:57.331
what we can find real quick.

04:57.366 --> 04:58.850
- Okay.
- Before we have to get back.

04:58.884 --> 05:00.783
Towels.

05:00.817 --> 05:01.991
Keep that bin.

05:02.025 --> 05:03.268
We can put stuff in the bin.
- All right.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.374
- Let's take a look at these
clothes--ooh, okay.

05:05.408 --> 05:07.479
We got a nice little dress.
This still has the tag on it.

05:07.514 --> 05:08.963
It was $16.

05:08.998 --> 05:10.240
There's some cute clothes.
- This is cute.

05:10.275 --> 05:11.449
- Look, and they're already
hung up for us.

05:11.483 --> 05:13.243
This is cute.
Five bucks.

05:13.278 --> 05:15.142
- Oh, my God, it's Free People.

05:15.176 --> 05:17.593
- Wow, okay, so we got some
labels going on right here.

05:17.627 --> 05:19.284
- Ten bucks.
- Done, easy.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.527
- Oh, these are
the jeans I saw.

05:20.561 --> 05:21.631
Look how cute these are.

05:21.666 --> 05:22.874
I like the pink.

05:22.908 --> 05:24.047
- This'll be cute on somebody.
Five bucks.

05:24.082 --> 05:25.048
- Yeah.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.118
- Where's the stuff
that fits us?

05:26.153 --> 05:27.741
Look at this blazer.

05:27.775 --> 05:29.190
This is nice.
Five bucks?

05:29.225 --> 05:31.469
- Hold on.

05:33.022 --> 05:34.713
- Oh, sequin--
wait, what is this?

05:34.748 --> 05:37.509
- It's a corset.
Shut up.

05:37.544 --> 05:39.339
- Wait, how cute would
that be with a--

05:39.373 --> 05:42.031
- Right now.
- With a jean jacket over it.

05:42.065 --> 05:43.412
- You think they'd notice
if you go back to the auction

05:43.446 --> 05:45.552
with this on?
Possible.

05:45.586 --> 05:47.208
- Or is this
a nasty time outfit?

05:47.243 --> 05:50.453
- This might be
a nasty time outfit.

05:50.488 --> 05:51.972
- Either way, we need it.

05:52.006 --> 05:53.801
This is ten bucks, for sure.

05:53.836 --> 05:55.596
- That's a cute little bag.
I say ten bucks--

05:55.631 --> 05:57.840
- Yes, done. Lookit.

05:57.874 --> 06:00.843
- Oh, those are cute.
- She was into fetishes.

06:00.877 --> 06:02.154
- Two bucks.

06:02.189 --> 06:04.329
- Okay, I kind of want to save
this, but it's here.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.676
I love the color.

06:06.711 --> 06:08.471
Let's see if there's
actually anything in it.

06:08.506 --> 06:10.266
- It's a osky brand
that we always see

06:10.300 --> 06:11.543
in the thrift store.

06:11.578 --> 06:12.924
- Ooh, I see something.
Hold on.

06:12.958 --> 06:14.857
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:17.549 --> 06:18.723
am] this s-

06:18.757 --> 06:20.621
Chaps.

06:20.656 --> 06:22.278
- This is like
high fashion right now.

06:22.312 --> 06:24.073
People will wear the shorts
and they put these over it.

06:24.107 --> 06:25.695
- I've always wanted chaps.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.352
- I can't get it--I'm gonna be
all up in your butt.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.148
You got to get it.
- Get in there, get in there!

06:30.182 --> 06:31.667
Not today.

06:31.701 --> 06:33.496
- Anyways, oh, my gosh.

06:33.531 --> 06:35.291
Let's see.
both: Oh, my God.

06:36.534 --> 06:38.950
It's Indiana Jones.
- It's Indiana Jones.

06:38.984 --> 06:40.434
- I told you
this woman was crazy.

06:40.469 --> 06:42.160
- These are expensive.
These are not cheap.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.231
This is like rodeo.
- I don't know.

06:44.265 --> 06:46.751
- Yes, Edwina--
chaps, rodeo, come on.

06:46.785 --> 06:47.959
I mean, it's in really
good condition.

06:48.994 --> 06:50.306
- Let's keep it
in the suitcase.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.998
I think $25 we could
sell it for in our store.

06:53.033 --> 06:53.999
No problem.

06:54.034 --> 06:55.449
Ooh.

06:57.486 --> 06:59.039
- Perfection.
That's 50 bucks.

06:59.073 --> 07:01.455
- This is gorgeous.
- It's all leather.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.146
- Ooh, okay.
- Oh, my God.

07:03.181 --> 07:04.700
Some "do me" shoes.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.667
- These are called "Incognito."
- These are not "do me" shoes.

07:07.703 --> 07:09.774
Oh, my God,
how tiny was this woman?

07:09.808 --> 07:11.223
- Very small.
Look how cute.

07:11.258 --> 07:14.572
- That's, like, ridiculous.
10 bucks on the shoes.

07:14.606 --> 07:16.850
See? And everybody was
sleeping on this locker.

07:16.884 --> 07:20.094
Once again, you and I know.

07:20.129 --> 07:22.200
All right, let's throw this
to the side and let's get back.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.304
- Okay.

07:23.339 --> 07:24.754
- All right, you guys,
here we go.

07:24.789 --> 07:26.169
â™ª

07:26.204 --> 07:27.723
5x5.

07:27.757 --> 07:29.759
- Ooh.

07:29.794 --> 07:32.728
â™ª

07:32.762 --> 07:35.489
Um, you know, the boxes,
they have some water damage.

07:35.524 --> 07:37.871
But some of it's not affected.

07:37.905 --> 07:40.045
Could be full
of little trinkets.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.772
So I think I'm gonna bid.

07:42.807 --> 07:43.877
- People let
their boxes get wet,

07:43.911 --> 07:45.292
means they don't care
a lot about 'em.

07:45.326 --> 07:46.845
If you don't take care
of your stuff on the outside,

07:46.880 --> 07:48.571
it's not gonna be good
on the inside.

07:48.606 --> 07:50.228
I feel like this is from--

07:50.262 --> 07:51.850
- It was a flood or something,
maybe.

07:51.885 --> 07:54.335
- A bunch of boxes.
- It could be damaged, though.

07:54.370 --> 07:55.923
- Hmm.
- Okay.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.235
- All right, let's see.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.099
- Ooh.
- Get in there.

07:59.133 --> 08:02.447
- Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
- Don't say "ew."

08:02.482 --> 08:03.862
- Ew, don't get
the funk on you.

08:03.897 --> 08:05.795
- Those are good bowls.
What's that, tapes?

08:05.830 --> 08:07.452
- Cassette tapes.
- I think so.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.729
I like it.
- No, you don't.

08:08.764 --> 08:09.937
- I think I'm gonna
make a move.

08:09.972 --> 08:11.801
- He's totally kidding.
- Please don't.

08:11.836 --> 08:13.320
- Part of me just
wants to make Bozek

08:13.354 --> 08:14.839
open all those
gross boxes.

08:14.873 --> 08:15.840
- Here we go.

08:17.324 --> 08:19.015
125...
125...

08:20.914 --> 08:21.915
- Yeah.

08:21.949 --> 08:22.950
- 150, 175.

08:22.985 --> 08:24.365
- Ugh, freakin' Jarrod.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.988
- 175...
200...

08:27.368 --> 08:29.923
250...
275 and now 300...

08:33.271 --> 08:34.375
275 and not 300?

08:34.410 --> 08:36.999
Sold it to you.
Mary got it for 275.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.828
- These boxes look messed up.

08:38.863 --> 08:40.796
But that doesn't mean
the doodads are.

08:40.830 --> 08:44.109
- Right this way.
Last unit of the day.

08:44.144 --> 08:46.111
â™ª

08:46.146 --> 08:48.389
- Whoa.
- 10x10.

08:48.424 --> 08:49.977
â™ª

08:50.012 --> 08:52.635
- Ooh.
There's a lot of stuff in here.

08:52.670 --> 08:54.119
Electric lawnmower.
- A lot of tools,

08:54.154 --> 08:55.155
but there's
a lot of crap too.

08:55.189 --> 08:56.812
- All right.
Yeah, Bozek.

08:56.846 --> 08:58.883
This is gonna hurt your back.

09:03.681 --> 09:06.235
- I think there's more trash
than stuff I can deal with.

09:06.269 --> 09:07.616
I'm out.
- Look at Ivy.

09:07.650 --> 09:08.617
Ivy acting like
he don't want it.

09:08.651 --> 09:09.859
He know he want that.

09:09.894 --> 09:11.585
- When he does that
with the flashlight...

09:11.620 --> 09:12.862
Like...

09:12.897 --> 09:14.588
- It's a nice room,
but it's just got too,

09:14.623 --> 09:17.211
too many pieces
of furniture.

09:17.246 --> 09:19.351
- Bozek's gonna love
that heavy-ass couch

09:19.386 --> 09:20.387
with the recliners in it.

09:20.421 --> 09:21.733
- All righty, guys, here we go.

09:21.768 --> 09:23.286
A little 10x10.

09:23.321 --> 09:24.909
- $1.

09:24.943 --> 09:26.566
100.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.188
150, 200, 250...

09:28.222 --> 09:29.361
Gonna make it 300.

09:31.225 --> 09:32.779
- Watch this.

09:32.813 --> 09:34.643
Let's see how Jarrod
likes getting bid up.

09:34.677 --> 09:35.747
- 400...

09:37.404 --> 09:39.509
500, 550...
- It's going a little fast.

09:39.544 --> 09:41.132
- 700, 750.
- Damn.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.651
- 800.
- So fast.

09:42.685 --> 09:43.652
- 900.

09:47.483 --> 09:49.485
- Skills.
- Skills.

09:49.519 --> 09:50.624
- Sold it to you, $900.

09:50.659 --> 09:53.351
Jarrod and Brandi got it
for $900.

09:53.385 --> 09:54.904
- I'm not sure
this is the locker

09:54.939 --> 09:57.079
I would've gone into
a pissing contest over.

09:57.113 --> 09:58.390
- All righty, guys,
that was it.

09:58.425 --> 09:59.633
Last unit of the day.

09:59.668 --> 10:02.187
- If you bought,
see me and pay before you load.

10:02.222 --> 10:04.155
And we'll see you next time.

10:04.189 --> 10:06.606
- Well, you know,
I just wasn't feeling it today.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.021
I came all this way

10:08.055 --> 10:09.574
just to make Jarrod pay more
than he wanted to,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.887
so yeah, it was worth it.

10:14.924 --> 10:16.132
- All right.

10:16.167 --> 10:20.033
I'm hoping for a bunch
of trinkets galore.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.482
Ah, ta-ta.

10:22.518 --> 10:24.175
All right.

10:26.833 --> 10:28.524
Kitchen stuff.

10:28.558 --> 10:31.147
Oh, there's some
champagne glasses.

10:31.182 --> 10:32.873
Little tea kettle.

10:32.908 --> 10:36.152
Perfect. I can sell all this
glassware stuff on my website.

10:36.187 --> 10:39.086
So I'm gonna say this box
is worth 75 bucks.

10:39.121 --> 10:40.674
Score.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.676
â™ª

10:42.711 --> 10:45.368
Ooh, peanut butter maker.

10:45.403 --> 10:46.576
So vintage.

10:46.611 --> 10:47.888
Perfect for my website.

10:47.923 --> 10:49.269
20 bucks.

10:49.303 --> 10:51.305
And the rest of this stuff--
ugh.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.687
Pots and pans.
Disgusting.

10:53.722 --> 10:57.070
Ugh, man, these boxes
are beat up.

10:57.104 --> 11:01.005
Oh, some pine cones.
Little Christmas decoration.

11:01.039 --> 11:03.835
Looks like lots
of glass pieces.

11:03.870 --> 11:05.423
Oh, yeah, a bell.

11:06.804 --> 11:09.979
Every time a bell rings,
an angel gets its wings.

11:10.014 --> 11:12.223
I'm gonna say this box--
40 bucks.

11:14.052 --> 11:16.952
Grody.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.298
Ew!

11:18.332 --> 11:21.819
Forget crusty plush.
This is dusty--ugh.

11:21.853 --> 11:24.718
Plethora o' sickness.

11:24.753 --> 11:26.202
Ah, please, bins,

11:26.237 --> 11:29.136
save me from my crusty plush.

11:34.176 --> 11:36.385
This thing looks freaking cool.

11:36.419 --> 11:37.835
Organic peanut butter.

11:37.869 --> 11:39.250
So neat.

11:39.284 --> 11:40.907
So I gotta get this thing
checked out.

11:40.941 --> 11:43.357
Maybe I just found myself
a side business.

11:43.392 --> 11:45.394
Good thing I don't
have a peanut allergy.

11:45.428 --> 11:47.120
â™ª

11:47.154 --> 11:49.847
Come on, be something good.

11:49.881 --> 11:52.056
Stenograph?

11:52.090 --> 11:53.436
Now we're freaking talking.

11:53.471 --> 11:55.024
And it has a warranty with it.

11:55.059 --> 11:56.439
I could sell this for,
probably what?

11:56.474 --> 11:58.165
40 bucks.
Okay.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.891
Things are looking up,
thank God.

11:59.926 --> 12:01.582
Boring purple wine glass.

12:01.617 --> 12:02.963
Dish.

12:02.998 --> 12:05.103
So this box--not bad.
40 bucks.

12:05.138 --> 12:07.485
Oh, Longchamp.
In the original box.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.866
15 bucks.

12:08.900 --> 12:13.491
I mean, where's all the doodads
and the tchotchkes?

12:13.525 --> 12:16.528
Thought this was gonna be it.

12:16.563 --> 12:20.049
A little hard drive.
Romance novels.

12:20.084 --> 12:22.327
This looks cool.
Never mind.

12:22.362 --> 12:24.088
Dang it.

12:24.122 --> 12:26.780
Oh, there's some
cute little earrings.

12:26.815 --> 12:28.368
$24.99.

12:28.402 --> 12:30.301
Sell 'em for ten bucks.

12:30.335 --> 12:32.924
Ugh, a tooth!

12:32.959 --> 12:34.754
Look at that thing.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.790
Sick.

12:36.825 --> 12:38.205
This stuff might be gold.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.552
Ooh, is that a Rolex?
Nope.

12:40.587 --> 12:42.934
50 bucks.
See what else is in here.

12:42.969 --> 12:45.834
This is cool.
25 bucks.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.421
My pocket book.

12:47.456 --> 12:49.769
China glass.
Ooh.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.806
Cute little tea cup.
Oh, "girlfriend."

12:52.841 --> 12:55.671
I've never seen a tea cup
that says "girlfriend."

12:55.705 --> 12:58.778
Come on over with some
crumpets and some biscuits.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.365
So this whole box--50 bucks.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.781
Ugh.

13:01.815 --> 13:06.751
The crustiest of colors,
and in the dustiest of lockers.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.063
Get out of here.

13:08.097 --> 13:10.582
Crusty, dusty.

13:10.617 --> 13:15.104
But I'm hoping that this
peanut butter machine

13:15.139 --> 13:17.106
is where the money is.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.627
- I had to get a big one.

13:20.661 --> 13:21.697
I'm stretching.

13:21.731 --> 13:24.458
- Don't pull a hammy.

13:24.493 --> 13:26.012
Whoa.
- Glove up.

13:26.046 --> 13:27.841
Safety, always safety.

13:27.876 --> 13:30.740
You know what they say, man,
no glove, no unit.

13:30.775 --> 13:32.052
- I thought it was "no love."

13:32.087 --> 13:33.778
- No, Bozek, lots of love, man.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.056
Lot--lots of love.
Miss you.

13:36.091 --> 13:37.851
- Whoa.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.611
- Whoa, don't break
our money, Bozek.

13:39.646 --> 13:40.854
- This is not your money.
- That's not it.

13:40.889 --> 13:42.166
That's not our money.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.857
- Let's just start
spreading it down the hallway.

13:43.892 --> 13:45.652
There's a lot of big
to get out of the way.

13:45.686 --> 13:47.240
- Whoa, that's level.
- Nothing, empty.

13:47.274 --> 13:49.069
- Nothing.
- Well...

13:49.104 --> 13:50.795
- Ooh.
- Break it.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.210
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:52.245 --> 13:55.282
Mm, tools.
- 100 bucks.

13:55.317 --> 13:57.388
- They already did
a horrible job at stacking.

13:57.422 --> 13:59.286
At stacking?
- Stacking.

13:59.321 --> 14:00.874
- Did a horrible job
at stacking.

14:00.909 --> 14:02.220
- Let's pull that out.
- Okay.

14:02.255 --> 14:04.084
paint sprayer thing out.

14:04.119 --> 14:05.223
Whoa!

14:05.258 --> 14:07.432
Oh, it's a texture sprayer.

14:07.467 --> 14:09.227
Uh, what do you think this
thing's worth, Brandi?

14:10.573 --> 14:11.747
- Look at that thing.

14:11.781 --> 14:13.922
That drill right there
is like 200 bucks.

14:13.956 --> 14:16.027
What do you think on that
paint sprayer, another 250?

14:16.062 --> 14:17.511
This lawnmower,
another 50 bucks.

14:17.546 --> 14:19.375
I wouldn't go much deeper.
I'd leave it.

14:19.410 --> 14:20.721
It's sturdy right now.

14:20.756 --> 14:22.482
As long as we don't move
that sofa right there,

14:22.516 --> 14:23.759
which is holding everything up.
- Oh, okay.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.347
- So let's leave
all that and that,

14:25.381 --> 14:27.073
and we'll just dip
this corner right here.

14:27.107 --> 14:28.315
Hey, Craftsman, Craftsman.

14:30.421 --> 14:32.423
- They're not all Craftsman.
Some are Stanley.

14:32.457 --> 14:34.908
Some areunk.

14:34.943 --> 14:36.116
Oh, my God,
look at all these sockets.

14:36.151 --> 14:37.117
These are worth money
right here.

14:37.152 --> 14:38.325
- Yeah, they are.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.327
- There are probably 300 bucks
in that toolbox.

14:40.362 --> 14:41.984
- All righty.

14:42.019 --> 14:43.710
- This is a--a brick saw,
just like the one

14:43.744 --> 14:44.814
we had at the house.
- Oh, a brick saw, yeah.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.782
- This thing is a beast.

14:46.816 --> 14:49.129
- I know, we're gonna get it
and just bring it right here.

14:49.164 --> 14:50.510
Not drop it completely.

14:50.544 --> 14:52.443
- Find a place to hold on to.
- Whoa.

14:52.477 --> 14:54.169
- It's a good thing
the hospital's close by.

14:54.203 --> 14:55.895
Okay.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.517
Oh, God.

14:57.551 --> 14:58.863
- Tell me when--
three, two, one.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.382
.
- Uh, you can set it down.

15:01.970 --> 15:03.419
- Here, let's just
set it right--

15:03.454 --> 15:04.938
- That one's
full of  too.

15:04.973 --> 15:06.940
- There we go.
There you go.

15:06.975 --> 15:08.424
There's 600 bucks.

15:08.459 --> 15:10.737
- There was Bozek's ass.
I haven't seen that in a while.

15:10.771 --> 15:13.498
- I feel like a piece of meat.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.775
- You think I can
stand on this?

15:14.810 --> 15:16.432
- No, it comes apart.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.262
â™ª

15:18.296 --> 15:19.677
- Okay, take this box
right here.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.679
Set it on the ground so I can
stand on it, and get out.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.750
- Bozek.

15:23.784 --> 15:25.476
Ooh, those are good-ass
speakers right there.

15:25.510 --> 15:26.822
Probably 50 bucks.

15:26.856 --> 15:28.651
- You can totally put those in
your bachelor pad.

15:28.686 --> 15:31.827
- There's one, two, three
full buckets of hand tools.

15:31.861 --> 15:33.794
Probably another--
at least 100 bucks.

15:33.829 --> 15:36.314
The couches are beat.
They're not worth anything.

15:36.349 --> 15:38.282
Uh-oh, what's this Craftsman
down there?

15:38.316 --> 15:40.629
Oh, Craftsman Shop Vac.
- Ooh.

15:40.663 --> 15:41.941
- 25 bucks.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.528
Yeah, there's at least another
couple of hundred bucks

15:43.563 --> 15:44.840
of miscellaneous .

15:44.874 --> 15:46.531
- I think Ivy thought
he bid us up on this unit,

15:46.566 --> 15:47.705
but, uh...

15:47.739 --> 15:49.741
- I think we bought
the best unit of the day,

15:49.776 --> 15:51.709
and Ivy went home
empty-handed, so...

15:51.743 --> 15:52.744
Who's winning?
- Womp womp.

15:52.779 --> 15:54.401
- We are.
- Oh.

15:54.436 --> 15:56.886
Hey, Bozek, make sure
you clean this up.

16:02.513 --> 16:04.549
â™ª

16:04.584 --> 16:06.379
- Phew.
Huh.

16:06.413 --> 16:07.932
- Hey.
- Hello.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.589
- Welcome.

16:09.623 --> 16:11.349
- I'm taking
my Nutter Butter machine

16:11.384 --> 16:13.593
to Zach and Valerie
Fishbain's house.

16:13.627 --> 16:15.595
They have a business
called Spread the Love.

16:15.629 --> 16:16.837
- Come on in.

16:16.872 --> 16:18.460
- Why don't we, uh,
get it out of the box?

16:18.494 --> 16:20.841
- So, what it--
it grounds up the peanuts?

16:20.876 --> 16:22.360
- Any kinds of nuts, actually.

16:22.395 --> 16:24.984
- Grocery stores will have it.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.503
A lot of places you can
buy your peanuts in bulk.

16:27.538 --> 16:30.575
- So, y'all's looks a lot,
um, older than mine.

16:30.610 --> 16:31.887
- Yes.
- It does.

16:31.921 --> 16:33.440
Definitely got a little
more wear and tear.

16:33.475 --> 16:35.649
- So, I mean,
I've heard about you guys,

16:35.684 --> 16:37.341
'cause your peanut butter
is freaking awesome.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.136
- Yeah.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.792
- There's a lot of stores
around the country,

16:40.827 --> 16:43.209
but our biggest account
is actually with Amazon.

16:44.417 --> 16:47.351
- Well, we started
back in 2013.

16:47.385 --> 16:50.147
We made 150 jars of
peanut butter for our wedding.

16:50.181 --> 16:53.460
- As wedding favors.
- Oh, my gosh, as favors.

16:53.495 --> 16:55.842
- And little did
we know at the time,

16:55.876 --> 16:57.740
uh, people would
keep asking for it,

16:57.775 --> 16:59.328
and people were putting in
purchase orders

16:59.363 --> 17:00.778
for their families,
friends, co-wor--

17:00.812 --> 17:02.504
- Do what you love,
and spreading the love.

17:02.538 --> 17:03.505
- Yeah.
- You know.

17:03.539 --> 17:04.816
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

17:04.851 --> 17:06.853
You mind if I take it apart
for a second?

17:06.887 --> 17:07.992
- Yeah. Totally.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.649
- Looks like it's been
very well-maintained,

17:09.683 --> 17:12.376
which is very good from a value
and a utility perspective.

17:12.410 --> 17:14.136
- That's good.

17:15.655 --> 17:17.622
Ah, cool.

17:17.657 --> 17:20.867
- These grooves push
the peanuts forward.

17:20.901 --> 17:23.697
And when this is attached, this
is actually what's grinding it.

17:23.732 --> 17:27.839
So all of the force
is taking this

17:27.874 --> 17:29.255
and turning it
into peanut butter.

17:29.289 --> 17:30.808
- You're ready to try
this thing out?

17:30.842 --> 17:33.052
- Yeah, I'm ready.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.329
- All right.

17:34.363 --> 17:37.021
- Mary, go ahead.
Start her up.

17:40.714 --> 17:42.026
- Looking good, guys.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.131
- Wow.

17:43.165 --> 17:45.133
That looks amazing.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.066
- Looking like peanut butter.

17:48.343 --> 17:50.379
Yes!

17:50.414 --> 17:52.864
- All right.
- It's warm.

17:52.899 --> 17:54.107
Mm, it's good!

17:54.142 --> 17:55.108
- Val, we got some
competition here.

17:55.143 --> 17:56.385
- Not as good as you guys.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.146
- That's some fresh
peanut butter right there.

17:58.180 --> 17:59.630
- Well, that's good
peanut butter,

17:59.664 --> 18:02.426
but I really need to know
how much this thing is worth.

18:02.460 --> 18:06.257
- Brand new,
it would be about $2,500.

18:06.292 --> 18:07.258
- Wow.

18:07.293 --> 18:08.328
- This is 14 years old,

18:08.363 --> 18:10.365
but it's in very
good condition.

18:10.399 --> 18:12.056
You got some nice
stainless steel.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.023
- It's well-maintained.

18:14.058 --> 18:16.543
- Hmm.
- Let's think about this.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.408
- I think $1,000.

18:19.443 --> 18:21.928
- Oh, nice.
- $1,000.

18:21.962 --> 18:24.862
- That's not peanuts.

18:26.864 --> 18:28.417
- Oh, my gosh.

18:28.452 --> 18:29.970
- Hello.

18:30.005 --> 18:30.971
- I am, yeah.

18:31.006 --> 18:32.352
- We hope so.
- Hopefully.

18:32.387 --> 18:34.492
Otherwise we just brought whips
to the wrong house.

18:34.527 --> 18:35.769
- Party.

18:35.804 --> 18:37.944
- Turns out,
Emily's got a whip guy.

18:37.978 --> 18:39.566
So we're taking our stuff
to Paul Nolan,

18:39.601 --> 18:41.050
owner of Midwest Whips.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.018
- Oh, wow.
- So here's the workshop.

18:43.052 --> 18:44.192
- Very nice.

18:44.226 --> 18:45.469
- This is where
all the whips get made.

18:45.503 --> 18:46.987
- Well, here are the whips.

18:47.022 --> 18:49.404
I'm excited to see
what you think about it.

18:49.438 --> 18:50.957
- Now this, I can tell you
right off the bat

18:50.991 --> 18:53.166
it's a, uh,
Australian-style stockwhip.

18:53.201 --> 18:54.926
The quality of this leather,
it looks like--more, like,

18:54.961 --> 18:56.445
amateur and hand-made.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.447
- You can see there's
a lot of gapping issues.

18:58.482 --> 19:01.968
Like, maybe something like that
might be worth...

19:02.002 --> 19:03.728
50 bucks on eBay
or something like that.

19:03.763 --> 19:05.799
- All right, so this'll
just come home with us.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.456
It'd be a great
wall hanger though.

19:07.491 --> 19:09.562
Ooh, a wall hanger.

19:09.596 --> 19:11.184
- This I'm really
excited about, though.

19:11.219 --> 19:13.186
This is a--a really nice whip.

19:13.221 --> 19:15.844
Probably about a ten-foot,
Indiana Jones-style whip.

19:15.878 --> 19:17.811
- He did, I just--

19:17.846 --> 19:18.950
I almost passed out.

19:18.985 --> 19:20.193
Like, this is the one
like he used?

19:20.228 --> 19:21.367
- It's just like it.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.023
A different color,
but it's the same--

19:23.058 --> 19:25.509
same strand counts, 12 plait,
herringbone here.

19:25.543 --> 19:26.613
- So what does
the differences in length mean?

19:26.648 --> 19:28.028
Do they mean anything?

19:28.063 --> 19:30.514
- The shorter ones are
usually better for targeting.

19:30.548 --> 19:32.101
The longer ones
are usually more--

19:32.136 --> 19:33.379
Have you ever seen in a show
with somebody--

19:33.413 --> 19:34.966
like, the assistant puts
their hands up

19:35.001 --> 19:36.727
and they wrap the body and wrap
the neck and stuff like that?

19:36.761 --> 19:38.763
- First date.

19:38.798 --> 19:39.902
A fun first date.

19:39.937 --> 19:42.215
- Edwina, we're gonna
scare him off.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.734
- It's not like I haven't
heard jokes before.

19:43.768 --> 19:46.012
- I--I'm sure you have, yeah.
- All right, good.

19:46.046 --> 19:48.152
So what do you think
this one is worth?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.189
- Ah, with this type
of quality whip...

19:50.223 --> 19:51.293
Mm...

19:51.328 --> 19:52.294
You're looking at...

19:52.329 --> 19:54.054
â™ª

19:54.089 --> 19:55.263
Probably about 800 bucks.

19:57.265 --> 19:58.438
- Okay.

19:58.473 --> 20:00.475
Well, I think we just
found a new passion.

20:00.509 --> 20:02.546
- Well, if you guys
want a demonstration

20:02.580 --> 20:03.650
we can head down to the park.
- Yes.

20:03.685 --> 20:05.238
- Yes, please.
- Please.

20:05.273 --> 20:07.551
Let's get to whipping.
- Get to crack your new whip.

20:07.585 --> 20:10.001
male announcer: Jarrod
and Brandi and Bozek

20:10.036 --> 20:11.969
kept things old-school,

20:12.003 --> 20:14.834
tooling their way
to 1,400 big ones.

20:14.868 --> 20:19.218
Mary Padian buttered
her bread with 1,100 peanuts.

20:19.252 --> 20:23.187
Edwina and Shana whipped up
over 1,000 bucks.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.018
And Ivy Calvin
just wasn't feeling it.

20:27.053 --> 20:29.158
- Show us some tricks.
What you got?

20:30.332 --> 20:31.678
I could cut a target
out of your hand.

20:31.713 --> 20:33.335
- She'll do it.
- Okay.

20:33.370 --> 20:35.751
I like how you
volunteered me so easily.

20:35.786 --> 20:37.270
- It won't hurt as long
as you don't move.

20:37.305 --> 20:39.099
- Oh, I--I didn't think
we were doing that.

20:39.134 --> 20:40.411
- Get it.

20:42.379 --> 20:44.277
, he did.

20:44.312 --> 20:46.521
- I didn't even feel it.

20:46.555 --> 20:47.591
- Oh, wow.

20:47.625 --> 20:48.902
- Probably hit
that again there.

20:50.663 --> 20:53.666
- I cannot believe how close
you got to my fingers.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.737
- You got some serious
cracking skills for sure.

20:55.771 --> 20:57.290
- Thanks so much.
