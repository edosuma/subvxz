WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:11.845
Sorry.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.555
Mike? I got you.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.348
Call 911!

00:15.432 --> 00:16.641
Tell me if I'm wrong…

00:16.725 --> 00:18.643
<i>You're not an only child</i>
<i>from Rhode Island.</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:20.562
<i>You have a brother</i>
<i>running for vice president,</i>

00:20.645 --> 00:23.732
<i>and the other one</i>
<i>was in some cult that killed your father.</i>

00:23.815 --> 00:27.110
What was I supposed to say?
Your father is wanted by the FBI?

00:27.193 --> 00:30.905
<i>As long as I am alive,</i>
<i>I can testify against him.</i>

00:33.575 --> 00:35.618
- Where are you going?
- You have to trust me.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.246
Why the fuck would I do that?

00:38.329 --> 00:40.874
Nick is here somewhere.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.959
He's been out there 30 years.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.169
Why come back?

00:44.252 --> 00:46.296
People have long memories.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.631
<i>You're on your own, you brood on the past.</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:52.927
That feeling connects you to something,
you hold on to it.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.096
Charlie!

01:04.355 --> 01:05.523
Who are you?

01:05.607 --> 01:07.275
Nick Harp.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.319
Your father.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.174
<i>Hello?</i>

01:32.091 --> 01:33.176
<i>Hello, Jane.</i>

01:34.844 --> 01:36.304
<i>I saw your message.</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:39.057
<i>Nick.</i>

01:40.225 --> 01:42.143
<i>I wondered if you'd see the interview.</i>

01:42.977 --> 01:44.687
<i>I've been keeping up on the news.</i>

01:45.396 --> 01:47.565
<i>Ever since you stole my move in the diner.</i>

01:48.858 --> 01:50.610
<i>And then you sent your friend.</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:52.987
<i>Should have come yourself.</i>

01:54.572 --> 01:57.033
<i>You'll remember</i>
<i>I'm a fucking fugitive.</i>

02:03.289 --> 02:04.541
<i>I've been thinking…</i>

02:08.586 --> 02:10.713
how to make things right between us.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.468
<i>Yeah? And how would you do that?</i>

02:18.304 --> 02:22.600
I give you what you want.
You leave me alone and I never testify.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.938
<i>Owning Jasper</i>
<i>is my consolation prize?</i>

02:32.443 --> 02:34.863
<i>You don't want to own</i>
<i>the next vice president?</i>

02:42.036 --> 02:43.246
<i>Where should we meet?</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:47.167
The last place I saw you.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.244
How did I get here?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.247
There was an accident.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.500
You hit your head pretty hard.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.630
I heard the crash
and found you calling for help.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.467
Where's Charlie?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.137
EMS was taking a man to the hospital.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.138
Who's Charlie?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.141
My friend.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.398
There was a woman who took care of me.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.316
Clara.

04:36.776 --> 04:37.986
She's long gone.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.911
Are you cold?
There's no electricity.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.092
You trying to decide?

05:02.301 --> 05:04.679
If there's any resemblance?

05:10.226 --> 05:11.644
It's the eyes.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.897
And the way you hold yourself.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.660
Must be quite a shock… to see me.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.580
Who did she say your father was?

05:45.511 --> 05:46.763
Did you love her?

05:50.892 --> 05:51.726
Yes.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.420
I'm sorry that happened.

06:22.423 --> 06:26.052
You always beat up
your pregnant girlfriends?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.264
I had no idea you existed until I saw you.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.309
That day in the woods…

06:33.935 --> 06:35.019
You remember that?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.021
I do now.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.484
You were this… perfect…

06:42.777 --> 06:45.863
- Perfect little creature.
- Why didn't you take me with you?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.370
<i>I wanted to.</i>

06:54.664 --> 06:56.666
That was no way for a child to live.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.835
In hiding.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.255
That <i>is</i> how I lived.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.841
I just didn't know it.

07:07.593 --> 07:11.639
Jane didn't tell you a thing, did she?

07:13.057 --> 07:14.225
She told me enough.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.228
- I know what you did.
- Do you?

07:18.187 --> 07:20.231
And what did she say about me?

07:24.485 --> 07:25.570
That you hurt people.

07:26.445 --> 07:31.868
I never wanted anyone to die, Andrea.
That's not what we were trying to do.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.871
I'm not the big bad wolf.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.247
Then who are you?

07:38.249 --> 07:42.753
You haven't noticed that men like
your grandfather strip-mine the world?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.172
Someone had to fight back.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.174
Uh, things haven't changed much.

07:46.257 --> 07:52.597
You're part of a very wealthy,
very corrupt family.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.639
They're not my family.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.558
You'll have to decide
what to do about that.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.853
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know you want the truth.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.523
That's something
your mother can't give you.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.941
What do you want from her?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.404
We have unfinished business.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.001
- What did you do to her?
- She's fine.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.048
Are you gonna behave?

11:08.959 --> 11:11.629
Oh, thank God. Are you all right?

11:11.712 --> 11:12.838
I'm okay.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.135
I'm sorry.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.929
I tried to keep you out of this.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.806
Is that why you ditched me?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.101
Jane's an expert at making an exit.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.898
- Charlie knew you'd come here.
- Charlie? What… Where is he?

11:31.440 --> 11:34.568
We were trying to find you.
There was an accident.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.405
An accident?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.156
They took him to the hospital.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.536
Come on. Let's sit down.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.473
Blonde suits you, Jane.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.562
When I first met your mother,

12:10.771 --> 12:12.440
I thought she belonged in a convent.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.568
Then I looked again.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.822
Is that what this is? You're gonna
take that money and run off together?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.449
What?

12:21.532 --> 12:26.454
You know, sometimes I wake up
and I think I'm in Andrew's old apartment.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.669
And I can feel you breathing beside me.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.089
I've forgotten all that.

12:41.635 --> 12:45.097
You're really going to pretend
our daughter doesn't remind you of me?

12:53.272 --> 12:55.149
Of course she reminds me of you.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.401
You've been there.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.529
Looking back at me every

13:01.530 --> 13:02.615
fucking day.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.602
When did you know you were pregnant?

13:37.191 --> 13:38.400
Just before Oslo.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.072
And why didn't you tell me?

13:44.114 --> 13:47.076
You sent me back
to the house to spy on my father.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.620
We barely saw each other.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.290
That's not an answer.

14:09.473 --> 14:13.811
My father and I
were sitting at breakfast when this

14:14.562 --> 14:15.771
wave hit me.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.067
I barely made it to the bathroom.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.574
Mrs. Barfield bought me
one of those drugstore tests.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.539
What did Martin say?

14:35.833 --> 14:38.043
I knew it was the last thing he wanted.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.589
Of course it was.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.359
You know our daughter disapproves of me.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.821
She thinks I ran a cult.

15:06.739 --> 15:11.493
She hasn't noticed she's already in one.
Family is the real cult, isn't it?

15:13.537 --> 15:15.456
I'm on the FBI's most wanted list.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.667
But the Quellers…

15:18.751 --> 15:21.462
They weren't exactly innocent,
are they, Jane?

16:10.886 --> 16:12.096
So where is it?

16:41.083 --> 16:45.045
What is that? What is that?

17:02.479 --> 17:05.315
<i>You'll take over the company.</i>
<i>The responsible son.</i>

17:05.899 --> 17:07.693
<i>- Jasper, I'm telling you…</i>

17:17.870 --> 17:19.246
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:22.458
<i>Just get Alex Maplecroft</i>
<i>invited to Oslo.</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:23.751
<i>I'll do the rest.</i>

17:25.294 --> 17:27.421
No one will know you had any part of this.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.090
This is insane.

17:30.924 --> 17:31.925
We can't pull it off.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.095
You'll take over the company.
The responsible son.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.182
Jasper, I'm telling you,
the board won't even blink.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.143
I want him out, but…

17:42.644 --> 17:44.438
- Not like this.
- Trust me.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.649
He'll resign. He'll have to.
He'll have no choice.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.075
Look, I know you know
he's got his eye on Jane.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.621
I don't know, maybe she could run it all.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.832
Maybe she is the one.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.298
You're sure about Grace Juno?

18:11.381 --> 18:12.925
She'll do whatever we ask her to do.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.594
I don't want to know the details. Just…

18:18.889 --> 18:22.017
<i>Just… Give me two weeks.</i>

18:29.066 --> 18:30.818
You knew Jasper was involved.

18:30.901 --> 18:31.777
No.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.154
- Not till later.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.073
But you've had that, this whole time.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.118
- Yeah, to buy my life back.
- You've had a life.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.579
What are you gonna do?
Blackmail your way to a pardon?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.207
We'll see.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.292
Jasper's had a good run.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.336
He's the only one of us
who got what he wanted.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.756
Well, now you have what you want.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.092
Not yet.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.928
I wanted to see you, Jane.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.224
You sent a man to kill me.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.101
No, I didn't.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.479
He was supposed to bring you to me.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.232
I couldn't exactly show up in Belle Isle.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.779
I don't believe you.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.242
There are things I'd like to know.
I think our daughter would too.

19:20.868 --> 19:27.708
Charlie.
Hey, Charlie, come on. Hey.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.836
What happened in Oslo, Jane?

19:33.505 --> 19:34.882
What happened in Oslo?

19:36.633 --> 19:40.470
- You know what happened in Oslo.
- I didn't give Grace that gun.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.097
Right.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.060
Just like you don't know
what happened to Charlie.

20:05.746 --> 20:06.788
Oh, God.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.041
- Andy, no! No, Andy! No!

20:09.124 --> 20:11.335
- Don't move! Don't move.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.456
- Honey, you're okay?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.671
Mom. Mom.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.772
Okay. Okay.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.045
Let me see your arm.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.757
You're okay. Stay here.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.570
You've been waiting to do this.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.572
I know you have.

22:46.823 --> 22:47.657
Do it.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.078
Come on, go ahead.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.039
Come on.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.376
- Come on, go ahead.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.591
Mom.

23:06.301 --> 23:09.679
Andrea, no. Oh, God,
I told you to stay there!

23:12.224 --> 23:13.475
What are you waiting for?

23:20.524 --> 23:21.358
Jane…

23:25.445 --> 23:27.197
You don't have to do this.

23:31.409 --> 23:32.410
It's over.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.414
Please don't do this.

23:37.874 --> 23:41.461
- US Marshals! Drop your weapon!
- Everybody on the ground, now!

23:41.545 --> 23:44.214
- Drop the gun, now!
- Drop your weapon!

23:46.550 --> 23:48.510
Everybody on the ground, now!

24:17.873 --> 24:19.249
Thanks for coming out here.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.419
I needed to see you were in one piece.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.755
I can't believe Charlie's gone.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.847
I used to resent Charlie.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.560
That he knew my wife more than I did.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.063
Now you know everything.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.865
I read everything I could. Martin. Oslo.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.618
Concert reviews. Everything.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.870
Thought it would help explain things,

24:58.455 --> 24:59.289
but it doesn't.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.084
Not really.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.170
Dad…

25:11.009 --> 25:12.677
You wanna change your name?

25:15.180 --> 25:16.431
I… What do you mean?

25:16.514 --> 25:18.308
I'm revising your mom's will.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.312
She's legally a Queller now,
so you should probably--

25:22.395 --> 25:24.022
I don't want anything from them.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.107
Listen, Andy. It's your legacy.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.236
Your mom wants you to have it.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.822
You're gonna have
to make your way back to her.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.617
It's different for you.
You can't avoid your mom.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.377
Anything you need me to say, I'm ready.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.336
Good.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.797
Government's been waiting
30 years to get this guy.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.800
- Oh, well, I've waited too.
- Fair enough.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.677
But after you give your testimony,

25:53.760 --> 25:56.137
Mr. Harp will be
heading straight to a supermax.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.847
Let him rot.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.913
- Mr. Queller.
- Hey, Marnie, could I borrow my sister?

26:22.831 --> 26:24.374
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.377
What are you doing here?

26:27.460 --> 26:31.214
- You didn't answer my calls.
- Andy was in the hospital.

26:31.923 --> 26:36.094
Hey, how is she? I heard the, uh…
I heard the whole thing was pretty brutal.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.057
Are you wondering about the tape?

26:41.141 --> 26:43.476
Well, it's gone.
Everything burned in the fire.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.605
You don't believe me?

26:48.982 --> 26:52.235
The, uh…
The Feds are willing to work with us

26:52.319 --> 26:54.946
as to when and how
the news breaks about Nick.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.489
Oh, he already has an attorney.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.034
- So?
- So, he'll find a way out of this.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.118
I don't think so.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.746
He's responsible
for the death of a US Marshal.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.958
Not to mention our father.

27:11.129 --> 27:14.007
We need to find out what he's
telling that lawyer. Don't you think?

27:14.090 --> 27:15.633
You can make that happen.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.885
I'm sorry?

27:17.677 --> 27:19.012
Find out what he's saying.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.892
Do you, do you even hear yourself?

27:24.684 --> 27:27.645
You-You're asking me
to interfere in the justice system.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.315
In a case involving our family
when I'm about to be…

27:35.028 --> 27:36.446
You really are incredible.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.074
Wow.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.545
Hey.

29:16.754 --> 29:17.630
Hey.

29:22.719 --> 29:23.762
Sorry, I'm, uh…

29:25.096 --> 29:26.473
I'm not here for work.

29:27.849 --> 29:31.060
Uh, are you all right?
What did the doctor say?

29:33.021 --> 29:34.481
They found a needle mark.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.108
Some kind of respiratory paralytic.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.987
They said if you didn't start CPR,
I wouldn't have made it.

29:42.363 --> 29:43.740
So, thank you for

29:45.283 --> 29:46.618
saving my life.

29:46.701 --> 29:49.621
Well, we're even.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.333
Uh…

29:54.375 --> 29:55.793
What are you doing here?

29:57.170 --> 29:58.963
I'm, uh, I'm driving up to DC.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.883
Figured I'd stop by on the way.

30:01.966 --> 30:02.967
What's in DC?

30:04.010 --> 30:05.678
Ask Internal Affairs.

30:06.804 --> 30:09.265
- I didn't get you fired, didn't I?
- I did what I did.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.559
We'll see what they say.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.026
How's your arm?

30:21.402 --> 30:22.320
It's fine.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.203
How are you doing with all this?

30:36.709 --> 30:37.669
I don't know.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.011
- It's hard to sleep.
- Hmm.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.889
I'll send a couple
of Feds up to your house

30:49.973 --> 30:51.599
to keep an eye on you and your mom.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.684
If you like.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.269
I'm picky about my stalkers.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.230
Right.

31:02.443 --> 31:05.405
You know, I am passing back through
in a couple of days, so…

31:07.740 --> 31:08.867
We could grab dinner.

31:10.618 --> 31:13.913
- Like normal people?
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.052
Do you think we could do that

31:29.345 --> 31:31.514
when I'm a little more…

31:33.266 --> 31:34.225
Sure.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.858
I'm glad you stopped by.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.739
Even if Belle Isle
isn't on the way to anything.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.203
I don't know.
I'm kind of coming around to this place.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.081
The scenery's not so bad.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.399
Wow.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.986
Hi.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.533
- Nothing sparks joy?

33:56.617 --> 33:57.827
It's all junk.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.875
We haven't talked.

34:07.962 --> 34:10.173
I thought maybe

34:11.883 --> 34:13.092
you needed some time.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.639
But you can ask me a question.

34:19.682 --> 34:20.725
Ask.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.485
Why'd you want to see Nick?

34:34.739 --> 34:35.615
I…

34:39.076 --> 34:40.745
wanted him to leave us alone.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.123
He could have killed you.

34:46.000 --> 34:46.876
I know.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.172
Sounds like you don't even care.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.596
He's been killing me every day.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.225
I just needed to get him out of my head.

35:06.771 --> 35:11.234
Sometimes I would become
so fucking enraged,

35:11.317 --> 35:13.194
I just wanted to burn the house down.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.157
I always thought I'd done something wrong.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.535
No! Oh.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.037
God, no. I…

35:24.914 --> 35:28.626
I never wanted you to see me like that.
That's why I would go to the beach.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.546
And I'd think, "What would Laura do?"

35:31.629 --> 35:34.715
Like she was a real person.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.302
She was real to me.

35:42.014 --> 35:42.849
I know.

35:46.727 --> 35:49.480
I'm trying to let her go
without losing everything else.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.319
I remember something
and then I think…

35:56.112 --> 35:57.071
Andy,

35:58.281 --> 36:00.491
our lives here with Gordon,

36:01.909 --> 36:03.161
all those years…

36:05.413 --> 36:06.706
You won't lose that.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.838
I just wanted you to have your own life.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.758
I mean, is it better

36:19.176 --> 36:20.052
knowing all this?

36:21.429 --> 36:23.389
Yeah, I know how I got here.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.183
I know

36:26.058 --> 36:27.226
what happened.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.436
I know who you love.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.229
And what do you want from Nick?

36:31.647 --> 36:32.523
What?

36:33.149 --> 36:34.901
- Nothing. I just… I…
- What?

36:35.568 --> 36:38.779
I'm glad I know who my father is.
Is that so terrible?

36:38.863 --> 36:40.740
I wish you'd never met him.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.828
- I wish I hadn't--
- You're mad at me.

36:47.121 --> 36:50.082
- For stopping you in the woods.
- He has nothing to give you.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.377
- He destroys people.
- I know what he does.

36:54.962 --> 36:55.796
No.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.592
- You don't.
- I didn't do it for him.

36:59.675 --> 37:03.304
I don't give a fuck about Nick.
I care about you, Mom.

37:03.930 --> 37:04.931
Do you get that?

37:06.140 --> 37:08.059
I want you to have your own life.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.394
What would that look like?

37:44.303 --> 37:46.264
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.433
- How can I help you?
- Uh, I was looking for…

37:51.978 --> 37:53.354
Do you have a Bösendorfer?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.606
Several. In the back.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.450
Would you like to…

38:09.161 --> 38:10.371
Yeah, just for a minute.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.539
As long as you like.

41:39.288 --> 41:40.539
Uh…

41:43.083 --> 41:47.630
I meant to tell you your…
Your real birthday.

41:53.636 --> 41:54.678
July 9th.

41:58.307 --> 42:01.560
You were supposed to come in June,
but you were two weeks late.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.104
Figures.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.443
You were born in the hospital

42:09.527 --> 42:12.821
of The Women's Correctional Facility
in Eugene, Oregon.

42:15.032 --> 42:15.908
Late at night.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.079
I held you for a while, and, um…

42:24.542 --> 42:26.835
And then they took you away.

42:39.765 --> 42:40.641
Did you…

42:42.643 --> 42:45.312
Did you ever think
of leaving me with Clara?

42:46.647 --> 42:47.565
For good?

42:53.153 --> 42:54.196
Yes.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.617
Yes, because I…

43:06.500 --> 43:07.501
didn't deserve you.

43:15.342 --> 43:16.260
It's over.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.725
You don't need to protect me anymore.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.810
Mind if I join you?

44:09.521 --> 44:11.440
- No, of course not.
- Perrier, please.

44:15.527 --> 44:16.820
You shouldn't be here.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.201
Why do they call it morning sickness?

44:23.243 --> 44:24.662
Mine lasts all day.

44:35.881 --> 44:38.634
Saltines. Right when you wake up.

44:38.717 --> 44:39.718
It helps.

44:43.681 --> 44:44.890
I think it's a girl.

44:47.142 --> 44:48.560
I don't know why, I just do.

44:54.149 --> 44:55.776
You should be with your father.

44:57.611 --> 44:58.570
My father…

45:00.531 --> 45:02.783
He's made it clear
how he feels about my condition.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.204
As if he has a say in whether she exists.

45:12.084 --> 45:13.502
<i>He tried to hurt her.</i>

45:14.795 --> 45:15.754
<i>He'll try again.</i>

45:16.588 --> 45:19.258
<i>He'll do anything</i>
<i>to stop her from being born.</i>

45:20.843 --> 45:23.053
<i>People treat him</i>
<i>like he's some kind of king.</i>

45:24.388 --> 45:26.390
The ambassador met us on the tarmac.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.271
Went straight through customs.
No questions asked.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.234
No one ever stops him.

45:42.739 --> 45:43.574
I'm sorry.

45:44.199 --> 45:45.659
My panel starts soon.

45:54.626 --> 45:56.503
- Have you lost something?

45:59.673 --> 46:03.177
You're not Alex Maplecroft.
Get this woman off the stage.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.679
- You won't take one more. Not one more!

46:05.762 --> 46:06.805
- God!

46:55.521 --> 46:57.606
Sorry. I-I know it's early.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.734
<i>Hey, everything okay?</i>

47:01.777 --> 47:05.697
<i>You read the, uh…</i>
<i>The WITSEC report about my mother?</i>

47:07.366 --> 47:09.076
Yeah. Um…

47:10.494 --> 47:11.453
Most of it.

47:12.246 --> 47:13.747
<i>What do you want to know?</i>

47:13.830 --> 47:15.666
I've been thinking about Grace Juno.

47:17.501 --> 47:18.585
Did she, uh…

47:20.754 --> 47:22.839
Did she leave a suicide note or anything?

47:23.423 --> 47:24.675
<i>No.</i>

47:24.758 --> 47:27.469
<i>But, uh, it was pretty clear</i>
<i>she blamed QuellCorp.</i>

47:28.262 --> 47:29.972
Then Nick put a gun in her hand.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.767
<i>Oh, how did they…</i>

47:33.850 --> 47:36.228
How did they know
Grace didn't bring it herself?

47:37.771 --> 47:39.189
<i>The security, they…</i>

47:39.815 --> 47:41.817
<i>They checked her bag when she walked in.</i>

47:46.196 --> 47:48.365
Did anyone see Nick give Grace the gun?

47:48.448 --> 47:49.616
Besides my mom?

47:49.700 --> 47:52.119
I'm sorry. My panel starts soon.

47:54.913 --> 47:56.206
Let me get this.

48:01.878 --> 48:02.754
<i>No.</i>

48:03.338 --> 48:05.173
<i>Your mom was the only witness.</i>

48:06.341 --> 48:08.468
<i>The whole case was built on her testimony.</i>

48:14.266 --> 48:15.100
<i>Andy?</i>

48:21.773 --> 48:25.193
<i>Andy? Andy?</i>

48:26.820 --> 48:28.071
<i>Andy, I can't hear you.</i>

48:31.074 --> 48:32.618
She and Grace…

48:42.461 --> 48:43.837
I'm afraid of him.

48:45.547 --> 48:47.841
He'll take her from me.
He takes everything.

49:03.607 --> 49:04.566
Yes.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.863
Yes, he takes everything.

49:12.741 --> 49:14.326
Take care of your daughter.

49:32.678 --> 49:33.512
<i>Andy.</i>

49:34.763 --> 49:36.306
They switched bags.

49:39.601 --> 49:40.435
<i>What?</i>

49:41.895 --> 49:43.855
<i>Nick knows.</i>
<i>That's why she's afraid of him.</i>

49:43.939 --> 49:46.650
Andy. Andy, I can't hear you.

49:47.776 --> 49:50.821
Uh… Sorry, I, I woke you up.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.281
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

49:53.365 --> 49:55.283
- <i>Andy.</i>

50:04.584 --> 50:07.003
But you're not
seeing things clearly.

50:07.087 --> 50:10.298
And I have to say,
I expected more of you, professor.

50:10.382 --> 50:13.218
- You can blame capitalism all you want--
- I blame you.

50:13.301 --> 50:15.053
Professor Maplecroft, please.

50:15.137 --> 50:18.265
When things go wrong,
we all like to point fingers,

50:18.348 --> 50:21.810
make it someone else's fault,
but that's not how the world works.

50:21.893 --> 50:24.813
And that is why you are all here.

50:24.896 --> 50:26.356
Reality check.

50:27.107 --> 50:29.568
And reality is complicated.

50:30.360 --> 50:35.115
It's easy for academics
to criticize pharmaceuticals for being…

51:34.716 --> 51:35.801
<i>Hello, Jane.</i>

51:40.347 --> 51:41.181
Jasper?

51:42.724 --> 51:44.559
<i>There'll be an announcement soon.</i>

51:47.270 --> 51:49.231
<i>I'm Senator Shepherd's running mate.</i>

51:52.984 --> 51:54.319
<i>Congratulations.</i>

51:55.654 --> 51:57.572
I took your advice about Nick.

51:57.656 --> 52:00.200
I thought it would be good
to know what was on his mind.

52:02.369 --> 52:05.580
<i>And he talked a lot about you.</i>

52:06.540 --> 52:07.499
<i>Oslo.</i>

52:10.544 --> 52:11.628
<i>What you did.</i>

52:16.550 --> 52:18.385
I've never understood you, Jane.

52:19.928 --> 52:22.305
But we're family.

52:26.309 --> 52:27.602
<i>I can keep it quiet.</i>

52:32.065 --> 52:33.233
What do you want?

52:38.321 --> 52:39.364
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

53:08.310 --> 53:09.978
<i>Take care of your daughter.</i>

53:17.277 --> 53:18.695
Keep breathing.

53:19.696 --> 53:20.530
Almost, almost.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.369
Jane. Wake up.

53:28.413 --> 53:30.123
<i>You're very precious to me.</i>

53:31.708 --> 53:33.376
<i>Oh, he's coming back.</i>

53:35.003 --> 53:37.631
<i>We can start over.</i>

55:56.102 --> 55:56.936
You okay?

56:06.613 --> 56:07.739
I thought you'd gone.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.914
No, I just couldn't sleep.

56:25.590 --> 56:27.467
You know, I didn't want to move here.

56:30.887 --> 56:32.388
And then the day we arrived…

56:34.682 --> 56:37.435
I saw the ocean for the first time.

56:37.519 --> 56:40.647
Just ran straight into the water.
