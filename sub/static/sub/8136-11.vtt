00:22.824 --> 00:24.758
Michael, have
you really forgotten me?

00:24.826 --> 00:26.987
Nothing makes sense
to me anymore. This face...

00:27.062 --> 00:29.189
And now,
I'm talking to a car.

00:30.966 --> 00:33.594
Michael is out there somewhere
living the life of a man,

00:33.702 --> 00:34.930
who's been dead
for two years.

00:36.505 --> 00:37.938
I'm gonna use you as bait.

00:38.006 --> 00:39.803
And then
you're both gonna die.

00:44.613 --> 00:46.513
KITT, I need you!

00:46.581 --> 00:48.276
Michael, jump!

01:05.300 --> 01:07.632
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:07.736 --> 01:10.170
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.238 --> 01:12.069
who does not exist.

01:18.447 --> 01:20.415
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.482 --> 01:23.212
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.285 --> 01:25.412
the helpless, the powerless,

01:25.487 --> 01:28.786
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:23.345 --> 02:25.438
You're still tracking
the truck, Michael?

02:25.514 --> 02:27.709
Not anymore, I'm chasing it.

02:27.849 --> 02:29.043
With a little luck,

02:29.117 --> 02:30.880
my Swamp Fox
technique will pay off.

02:30.952 --> 02:32.749
What on earth is Swamp Fox?

02:32.821 --> 02:35.221
The greatest tracker
of all time, KITT.

02:35.924 --> 02:37.585
My childhood hero.

02:37.726 --> 02:39.694
Please remember
it's the catching

02:39.761 --> 02:41.820
that's the important part
of the chase.

02:42.030 --> 02:43.361
Now keep me posted.

02:43.965 --> 02:46.126
Swamp Fox. Really, Michael.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.546
KITT, there's no sign
of him anywhere.

03:36.618 --> 03:38.483
It's like he was
swallowed up by the dam.

03:39.854 --> 03:41.788
I'm gonna check it out.

03:41.856 --> 03:43.221
Can you hear me, buddy?

03:43.291 --> 03:45.418
Michael, I'm having
trouble receiving you.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.518
Something in the dam
is blocking transmission.

03:47.596 --> 03:50.087
I suggest you use
extreme caution.

05:11.513 --> 05:12.946
So that's it.

05:13.682 --> 05:16.412
KITT, I've found it.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.554
Checkout time is at 12:00.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.856
Come on, we need these
rooms for a convention.

06:03.164 --> 06:06.600
Okay, we're looking
at a mild concussion,

06:06.835 --> 06:08.996
bruised ribs,
nothing broken.

06:10.004 --> 06:12.131
You're lucky
you're in such good shape.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.834
Are you a football player
or were you born this way?

06:16.411 --> 06:19.608
Case. I'm workin' on a case.

06:21.349 --> 06:22.839
Getty Caulfield.

06:22.951 --> 06:25.419
Well, right now, you're
at the Hoff Medical Center.

06:25.487 --> 06:28.183
And all you should be
working on is getting better.

06:28.256 --> 06:29.814
Now what's your name?

06:30.658 --> 06:31.886
Michael.

06:33.228 --> 06:34.695
Michael Long.

06:36.164 --> 06:37.392
L-O-N-G?

06:38.299 --> 06:39.391
Yeah.

06:40.235 --> 06:41.497
Ah.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.667
I'm a police officer.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.963
I gotta report in.

06:46.241 --> 06:47.435
Oh!

06:47.876 --> 06:50.071
At the moment, Officer Long,

06:50.145 --> 06:52.045
the only ticket
you're gonna be writing

06:52.113 --> 06:54.343
is the one on the nightstand
for your meals.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.781
And I suggest you stay away
from the chicken surprise.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.546
It'll only keep
you here longer.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.381
The pretty girl
won't like that.

07:01.523 --> 07:02.922
Pretty girl?

07:04.826 --> 07:06.020
What pretty girl?

07:06.094 --> 07:08.085
The brunette
who's been asking for you

07:08.163 --> 07:09.755
ever since you checked in
last night.

07:09.831 --> 07:12.629
I don't know anybody.
Brunette?

07:13.201 --> 07:15.294
Well, let's not worry
about that now.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.003
And I wouldn't worry about
Getty Caulfield, either.

07:18.072 --> 07:19.733
He's been dead
for almost a year.

07:20.842 --> 07:22.002
He's dead?

07:22.143 --> 07:23.542
I read the papers.

07:27.949 --> 07:30.543
Dr. Adler, wanted in surgery.

07:54.042 --> 07:55.441
My face.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.740
My God,

07:59.447 --> 08:01.438
what happened
to my face?

08:01.516 --> 08:03.848
Hey, what's the matter
with you?

08:05.086 --> 08:06.212
What did you say?

08:06.287 --> 08:09.279
We're here.
Comes to $12.95.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.996
I told you to take me
to 1834 Shoreborne Ave.

08:25.406 --> 08:27.203
Well, that's where
you are.

08:27.742 --> 08:30.506
But there's supposed to be
an apartment building here.

08:31.913 --> 08:33.346
My apartment building.

08:33.414 --> 08:34.403
Look, buddy,

08:34.482 --> 08:36.643
what's supposed to be here
is beyond my control.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.811
Now, what about
the $12.95?

08:39.888 --> 08:40.980
What?

08:41.489 --> 08:42.477
Oh.

08:43.491 --> 08:44.685
Ah.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.425
Don't tell me.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.563
"My wallet was
here a minute ago. "

08:49.631 --> 08:50.996
Ah, forget it.

08:51.466 --> 08:53.661
Wait a minute. Just take me
to the police station.

08:53.768 --> 08:55.565
Eleventh precinct.
I work there.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.069
Yeah, sure.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.576
Hey! Wait a minute!

09:42.216 --> 09:43.774
Michael, wait.

09:44.786 --> 09:46.185
You talkin' to me?

09:46.321 --> 09:47.982
Here, take this, please.

09:48.556 --> 09:49.716
Who are you?

09:50.591 --> 09:51.888
Do you know me?

09:51.960 --> 09:54.087
If I did not have
such a wonderful self-image,

09:54.162 --> 09:55.424
I would be crushed.

09:55.496 --> 09:57.726
You'd think a man would be
a little more receptive

09:57.799 --> 10:00.165
when the girl he was with
returns his stuff.

10:00.268 --> 10:01.565
Call me, okay?

10:02.136 --> 10:04.104
Wait, wait a minute! Wait!

10:40.675 --> 10:41.767
Gone?

10:42.477 --> 10:44.138
What do you mean,
"gone"?

10:44.312 --> 10:46.542
This is a hospital,
not a high school.

10:46.614 --> 10:48.241
You don't need a note
from your mother

10:48.316 --> 10:49.442
to come and go.

10:50.318 --> 10:52.582
He left AMA,
against medical advice.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.678
Well, how was he
when you last saw him?

10:54.756 --> 10:56.451
A little scattered
from the concussion,

10:56.524 --> 10:57.855
but nothing serious.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.722
Normal disorientation.

10:59.994 --> 11:02.155
This chart states
his name is Michael Long.

11:03.131 --> 11:04.393
In the absence of ID,

11:04.499 --> 11:06.524
we usually take
a patient's word.

11:06.601 --> 11:09.297
You'd be amazed
at some of the names we get.

11:12.807 --> 11:14.297
Michael Long?

11:14.475 --> 11:16.272
Devon,
what's happened to him?

11:16.344 --> 11:17.868
With a head injury,
I'm afraid

11:17.945 --> 11:20.175
some form of amnesia
may not be unlikely.

11:20.248 --> 11:22.307
When we picked up KITT
at the police impound,

11:22.383 --> 11:25.352
all he could give us was the ambulance
number to trace to the hospital.

11:25.420 --> 11:27.752
He couldn't have known
this had happened to Michael.

11:27.822 --> 11:29.585
We got to
find him fast.

11:29.657 --> 11:31.522
He'd go where
Michael Long would've gone.

11:31.592 --> 11:32.581
To his old apartment.

11:32.660 --> 11:33.854
Or his precinct.

11:34.295 --> 11:36.092
I'm afraid Michael
is out there somewhere

11:36.164 --> 11:38.564
living the life of a man
who's been dead for two years.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.575
Oh, that's, uh,
authorized personnel only.

11:50.645 --> 11:51.942
Can I help you?

11:53.681 --> 11:55.148
Are you subbin'
for Jerry?

11:55.216 --> 11:56.205
Jerry?

11:56.784 --> 11:59.480
Oh, you mean
Sgt. Brinkman. He's retired.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.049
What can I do for you?

12:01.122 --> 12:02.111
Retired?

12:02.657 --> 12:04.056
What are you talkin' about?

12:04.125 --> 12:05.149
Who are you anyway?

12:05.226 --> 12:06.716
You've never worked
the desk before.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.388
Look, if you've got a problem,
I'm here to help.

12:09.464 --> 12:11.432
If not, I've got
a lot of work to do.

12:13.401 --> 12:15.528
Hey! I'm not gonna
tell you again.

12:15.770 --> 12:17.670
You don't go in there.

12:27.482 --> 12:29.347
I've got business in there.

12:29.417 --> 12:30.975
My name is Michael Long,

12:31.052 --> 12:33.919
serial number 10509,
badge number 8043.

12:34.789 --> 12:37.656
I don't know about you,
but I work here.

12:39.127 --> 12:40.754
This is the wrong precinct

12:40.828 --> 12:43.422
to try to pass yourself off
as Michael Long.

12:43.564 --> 12:45.191
He was a good cop.

12:45.266 --> 12:47.166
All the guys
took his death hard.

12:51.405 --> 12:52.838
Devon Miles, please.

12:54.142 --> 12:55.837
I've reprogrammed
KITT to seek Michael

12:55.910 --> 12:57.673
and self-activate
if he finds him.

12:57.745 --> 12:58.803
Good. Good.

13:02.617 --> 13:03.675
Yes?

13:04.285 --> 13:05.616
Are you sure?

13:06.053 --> 13:08.283
See if you can keep him
there until we arrive.

13:08.356 --> 13:09.653
Thank you, Officer.

13:10.925 --> 13:13.018
Come on.
They've found him.

13:14.729 --> 13:16.060
I don't want
any trouble.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.563
I just want to get
some answers.

13:17.632 --> 13:19.259
We don't want
any trouble either.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.358
Let me buy you a cup of
coffee. We'll talk about it.

13:21.469 --> 13:22.595
Don't play
good cop with me.

13:22.703 --> 13:23.863
I know
all those games.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.404
Now, come on,
fella, calm down.

13:25.473 --> 13:26.770
Let go of me!

13:29.210 --> 13:30.472
You okay?

13:30.545 --> 13:31.637
Yeah.

13:54.202 --> 13:57.171
Devon, April,
wait. I've located Michael.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.066
Michael, Michael.

14:34.909 --> 14:36.774
Michael, please. Stop.

14:37.478 --> 14:38.877
It's me, KITT.

15:34.135 --> 15:35.625
All right, out!

15:37.905 --> 15:39.736
Hands away from your body.

15:39.807 --> 15:42.435
This is not quite the
reunion I'd hoped for, Michael.

15:42.510 --> 15:45.240
I said, get out of the car.

15:54.055 --> 15:56.250
Michael, have
you really forgotten me?

16:01.062 --> 16:02.086
Are you all right?

16:02.163 --> 16:03.528
No.

16:03.597 --> 16:04.962
No, I'm confused.

16:05.066 --> 16:06.556
Nothing makes sense
to me anymore.

16:06.634 --> 16:07.965
This face...

16:08.069 --> 16:09.832
It's not my face.

16:09.937 --> 16:11.734
My whole world
has disappeared.

16:12.340 --> 16:15.901
And now,
I'm talking to a car.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.204
I think I can explain
everything, Michael.

16:21.382 --> 16:22.781
How do you know my name?

16:22.850 --> 16:24.647
We're partners, you and I.

16:24.852 --> 16:26.911
We're a team.
Please, let me help you.

16:27.188 --> 16:28.382
Get in.

16:29.457 --> 16:30.481
No, thanks.

16:30.558 --> 16:32.492
As you pointed out,
I'm only a car.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.425
Please. Trust me.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.877
I've never seen
anything like this.

16:55.316 --> 16:57.113
Hey, what's going on?

16:57.184 --> 16:59.744
Let me out.
Let me out of here!

16:59.820 --> 17:02.050
I'm sorry, Michael,
but I can't do that.

17:02.123 --> 17:04.853
April's programmed me
specifically to help find you

17:04.959 --> 17:07.086
and return you
to the Foundation.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.685
Let me out!
I said, open the door!

17:08.762 --> 17:10.060
Please forgive me.

17:10.131 --> 17:11.358
Let me out of here!

17:13.367 --> 17:15.561
Since we didn't have
any charge to hold him on...

17:15.669 --> 17:17.329
Devon, can you hear me?

17:17.438 --> 17:19.463
That's KITT. He's on
the police frequency.

17:19.573 --> 17:21.507
I have Michael
and I'm returning him

17:21.575 --> 17:24.042
to the Foundation.
Please rendezvous immediately.

17:38.926 --> 17:40.393
What is this?

17:40.995 --> 17:43.225
What are you trying
to tell me? I'm dead?

17:43.297 --> 17:44.662
You were Michael Long.

17:44.732 --> 17:47.530
You now have a new identity,
a new purpose.

17:47.735 --> 17:49.293
You are now
Michael Knight.

17:49.470 --> 17:51.131
Why would we go
to all this trouble

17:51.238 --> 17:52.796
if we didn't care about you?

17:52.907 --> 17:54.534
I don't know.
I don't know.

17:54.608 --> 17:57.406
That's one of the things,
I'm trying to figure out here.

17:57.478 --> 17:58.672
At the time
of the explosion,

17:58.746 --> 18:01.010
you were working on
the Getty Caulfield case.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.446
Do you remember that?

18:02.516 --> 18:03.915
I remember the name.

18:04.785 --> 18:06.548
What do you know
about Getty Caulfield?

18:06.620 --> 18:08.679
He was a multimillionaire
industrialist.

18:08.889 --> 18:11.653
At the time of his death,
$10 million worth

18:11.725 --> 18:13.852
of his privately-owned Alidium
was stolen

18:13.928 --> 18:16.123
in transit to
a government facility.

18:16.197 --> 18:18.290
Alidium is an exotic alloy.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.458
It's a vital catalyst
in the space program.

18:20.568 --> 18:23.469
The authorities had
given up all hope of finding it.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.095
They contacted the Foundation.

18:25.206 --> 18:27.037
That's where you
became involved.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.308
You'd found
the thief, remember?

18:29.743 --> 18:31.335
You were tracking him.

18:31.412 --> 18:32.811
You chased him
to Bedford Dam,

18:32.880 --> 18:34.347
and then we lost
contact with you.

18:34.415 --> 18:36.144
Michael,
please try to remember.

18:36.217 --> 18:37.878
No, no, I am a cop.

18:38.319 --> 18:40.048
Now, if I was looking
for this Alidium,

18:40.120 --> 18:42.111
it was police business.
But, Michael...

18:42.189 --> 18:44.214
I work alone, okay?
I want my gun back.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.122
I'm afraid I can't
give it to you. Why not?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.524
The gun is not
registered to you.

18:47.595 --> 18:49.187
It's not legal for you
to carry a gun.

18:49.263 --> 18:50.787
I can't let you leave here

18:50.865 --> 18:53.629
and wander the streets alone
not knowing who you are.

18:53.734 --> 18:55.395
Well, you can't stop me.

19:02.610 --> 19:04.202
Devon,
what are we gonna do?

19:04.278 --> 19:07.076
If we pressure him anymore,
we'll drive him even further away.

19:07.181 --> 19:09.445
The only thing
we can be sure of

19:09.483 --> 19:11.110
is that he won't be alone.

19:17.091 --> 19:18.888
Michael. Michael.

19:18.959 --> 19:19.983
Leave me alone.

19:20.060 --> 19:22.927
I'm coming with you, Michael.
We're a team.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.891
Not anymore,
we're not.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.261
Beat it!

19:54.194 --> 19:55.422
Get out of here!

20:03.637 --> 20:05.502
I'd tell you to get
this through your head,

20:05.606 --> 20:06.630
but you're a machine.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.005
So run this through
your data processor.

20:09.076 --> 20:10.304
Get lost!

20:10.377 --> 20:11.708
I can't do that, Michael.

20:11.779 --> 20:14.179
I'm programmed
to respond to your needs.

20:14.248 --> 20:15.647
Despite your
being unaware of it,

20:15.716 --> 20:16.774
you need me.

20:16.850 --> 20:18.181
What if I don't want you?

20:18.252 --> 20:20.015
I suppose I'll be quite hurt.

20:20.621 --> 20:22.486
All right.

20:23.591 --> 20:26.685
It's pretty hard to get around
without a set of wheels.

20:30.631 --> 20:31.962
All right.

20:32.366 --> 20:33.765
I drive from here on.

20:33.867 --> 20:35.027
Absolutely.

20:35.135 --> 20:36.864
Providing you'll
promise me one thing.

20:36.971 --> 20:37.960
What?

20:38.072 --> 20:40.233
Please do not refer to me
as a car

20:40.474 --> 20:42.942
or a set of wheels.
It's most demeaning.

20:43.444 --> 20:45.969
I'm the Knight Industries
Two Thousand.

20:46.213 --> 20:47.942
You've always called me KITT.

20:48.015 --> 20:50.483
All right, KITT.

20:51.819 --> 20:53.411
Let's see what you can do.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.664
What does this do?

21:10.771 --> 21:12.033
Michael,
I don't think you...

21:17.945 --> 21:20.345
Oh! Whoa!

21:21.181 --> 21:22.409
You are hot!

21:22.483 --> 21:23.950
Quite true, Michael.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.444
Whoa!

21:43.470 --> 21:44.960
Is something wrong?

21:45.072 --> 21:47.540
You're acting
very strangely, Michael.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.438
It's something I keep seeing
over and over again.

21:54.682 --> 21:56.547
It doesn't make
any sense to me.

21:57.685 --> 21:58.845
Fist.

22:00.854 --> 22:02.082
My fist.

22:04.558 --> 22:06.185
The shape of it.

22:06.527 --> 22:08.358
Perhaps if we take
a closer look.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.525
How did you do that?

22:12.633 --> 22:13.827
Computer graphics.

22:13.934 --> 22:15.663
It's one of my many
functions, Michael.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.259
How about this?

22:21.909 --> 22:23.376
I don't know.

22:24.244 --> 22:25.802
I don't know.

22:28.882 --> 22:30.543
You know,
it's a terrible feeling.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.710
Every time I pass a mirror,

22:32.786 --> 22:35.220
or see a reflection
in a window,

22:37.024 --> 22:38.924
I see a stranger's face.

22:38.992 --> 22:40.983
I wish I could help you
regain your memory,

22:41.061 --> 22:43.120
especially your memory of me.

22:43.197 --> 22:45.427
We have quite
a history together.

22:45.499 --> 22:46.488
Yeah, well,

22:46.600 --> 22:48.568
that's why we're going back
to the dam

22:48.869 --> 22:51.064
to see
if it'll help me remember.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.582
This place has been deserted
for eight years.

23:10.924 --> 23:12.824
Why would the thief
have come out here?

23:12.893 --> 23:14.724
My only
information on Bedford Dam

23:14.795 --> 23:16.592
is that it's marked
for demolition.

23:16.663 --> 23:20.030
Even its hydraulic works
were recently auctioned off.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.693
KITT,

23:22.669 --> 23:24.296
what was I doing out here?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.167
Chasing the suspect,
Michael.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.969
He ran up
that center lock.

23:32.479 --> 23:33.741
Chasing him.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.580
I was chasing him.

23:49.229 --> 23:52.255
Michael, there's a man with
a gun on top of the dam.

23:52.332 --> 23:53.560
Michael?

23:58.839 --> 24:00.807
KITT, I need some help!

24:00.908 --> 24:02.341
It's about time.

24:42.883 --> 24:44.316
Why did he stop firing?

24:44.384 --> 24:46.011
Quite possibly
because he's gone.

24:46.086 --> 24:47.314
What do you mean?

24:48.188 --> 24:49.382
He can't be gone.

24:49.456 --> 24:50.821
It doesn't matter,
Michael.

24:50.891 --> 24:52.586
He simply disappeared.

24:57.598 --> 24:59.065
You out of your mind?

24:59.132 --> 25:00.690
What are you
shootin' at out there?

25:00.801 --> 25:02.132
That guy in the black car.

25:02.236 --> 25:03.999
I told you we should've
checked the body.

25:04.104 --> 25:05.264
What are you talkin' about?

25:05.372 --> 25:06.600
He's not dead, Frank.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.573
Well, that's too bad for him.

25:09.076 --> 25:11.203
All that trouble
to stay alive,

25:12.145 --> 25:14.238
and now he's gonna
have to die again.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.641
I'm sorry, Michael,
but I'm not picking up

25:16.717 --> 25:18.810
any human life
readings in this area.

25:35.469 --> 25:36.868
What exactly do you expect

25:36.937 --> 25:38.495
to find
in that wallet, Michael?

25:38.605 --> 25:40.937
I don't know, KITT.

25:42.242 --> 25:43.971
Hopefully something
to identify the girl

25:44.044 --> 25:45.011
who gave it to me.

25:45.445 --> 25:47.709
She's tied into this thing
one way or another.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.381
If only I had a police lab,

25:50.450 --> 25:52.315
I could run
an analysis on this thing.

25:52.386 --> 25:53.751
We can do it
right here, Michael.

25:56.390 --> 25:57.516
Uh...

25:57.858 --> 25:59.621
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

25:59.693 --> 26:02.287
It's not an ashtray.
It's a chemical analyzer.

26:02.362 --> 26:03.920
With it, we can detect

26:03.997 --> 26:06.227
any identifiable
qualities of the wallet.

26:06.433 --> 26:10.267
You are a regular wonder
on wheels, aren't you?

26:10.337 --> 26:11.668
I like to think so.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.733
KITT.

26:15.475 --> 26:17.602
You said you knew me
before the accident.

26:18.979 --> 26:20.537
What was Michael Knight like?

26:20.614 --> 26:22.639
Michael Knight
was bright, agile,

26:22.716 --> 26:24.343
and often quite logical.

26:24.484 --> 26:26.952
He was also stubborn,
impatient,

26:27.020 --> 26:29.250
readily distracted
by pretty girls

26:29.690 --> 26:32.386
and he listened to, possibly,
the most appalling music

26:32.459 --> 26:34.654
to ever shatter my airwaves.

26:34.728 --> 26:36.320
Sounds like my kind of guy.

26:36.396 --> 26:37.988
Yes, that's what
I'm afraid of.

26:39.299 --> 26:41.164
It's an extremely
high-grade leather

26:41.268 --> 26:42.462
imprinted by a method

26:42.569 --> 26:45.037
used only by
fashionable boutiques.

26:45.172 --> 26:46.730
Fashionable boutiques, huh?

26:46.907 --> 26:48.534
Leaves a lot of
ground to cover.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.337
Under normal
circumstances, yes.

26:50.410 --> 26:52.037
However,
this particular wallet

26:52.112 --> 26:54.080
was purchased at
a shop called Caine's.

26:54.915 --> 26:56.906
Caine's. I'm impressed.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.141
I mean,

26:58.218 --> 27:00.778
how does a chemical analyzer
identify a store?

27:00.854 --> 27:03.550
It didn't.
There's a card inside.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.388
Good work, KITT.

27:05.525 --> 27:07.789
Oh, one other thing
about Michael Knight.

27:07.861 --> 27:08.919
What's that?

27:08.996 --> 27:10.486
I was extremely
fond of him.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.271
Well, the girl who
bought the wallet

27:29.349 --> 27:32.614
lives at 1735 Hollyway Lane,
apartment 305.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.510
Her name is Cara.

27:34.888 --> 27:36.219
Cara Caulfield,

27:36.423 --> 27:38.152
as in Getty Caulfield.

28:20.901 --> 28:22.459
Ah! Security system.

28:33.814 --> 28:35.247
Should I say thanks?

28:35.315 --> 28:37.249
If you do, I'll
say, "You're welcome. "

28:37.317 --> 28:38.409
Thanks.

28:38.485 --> 28:39.474
De nada.

29:21.528 --> 29:22.893
Hello, Cara.

29:22.963 --> 29:25.898
Michael, you're early.
Come in.

29:33.707 --> 29:36.039
The lasagna won't be ready
for another half-hour

29:36.109 --> 29:38.043
so I hope you're not
starving to death.

29:38.111 --> 29:40.204
Why don't we go ahead
and open the wine?

29:41.214 --> 29:42.613
Who are you?

29:43.150 --> 29:45.277
Oh, look at that.
I don't have a corkscrew.

29:45.352 --> 29:46.376
Be an angel.

29:46.453 --> 29:48.580
Go to the liquor store
and get one for me, will you?

29:48.655 --> 29:50.247
I don't know you.

29:50.323 --> 29:52.018
And I've never been
here before,

29:52.092 --> 29:53.616
and you're not
waiting for me.

29:53.693 --> 29:55.752
So why don't you just tell me
what's going on

29:55.829 --> 29:58.923
like why you handed me a gun
and a wallet full of money?

30:00.800 --> 30:03.394
I was trying to help you,

30:04.137 --> 30:06.162
that's all.
Isn't that enough?

30:06.540 --> 30:08.371
Can't you just accept that
and leave?

30:08.441 --> 30:09.703
No, it's not enough.

30:10.443 --> 30:12.138
It's not nearly enough.

30:14.214 --> 30:16.512
What's your relationship
with Getty Caulfield?

30:16.583 --> 30:18.346
He was my grandfather.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.352
Now please get out of here.

30:20.420 --> 30:21.409
Why?

30:21.821 --> 30:23.413
Are you expecting someone?

30:24.291 --> 30:26.452
Are you?
Who's coming over?

30:27.460 --> 30:28.484
Frank.

30:28.562 --> 30:29.756
Who's Frank?

30:30.630 --> 30:33.861
He's my boyfriend. Was.

30:34.634 --> 30:36.534
I met Frank in college.

30:37.003 --> 30:37.992
He told me

30:38.104 --> 30:40.197
Grandpa was selling
the Alidium to the military.

30:40.307 --> 30:42.707
He said it was wrong
to use it to hurt people.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.376
He said he'd see to it

30:44.444 --> 30:46.435
that it was used
for peaceful projects.

30:46.813 --> 30:48.303
And the next thing I knew,

30:48.381 --> 30:50.372
you'd been hurt,
almost killed,

30:51.117 --> 30:54.086
and when I saw you
in the hospital so helpless...

30:54.154 --> 30:56.179
So you brought me a gun

30:56.256 --> 30:58.816
so I could protect
myself against Frank.

30:58.892 --> 31:00.621
I want to tell
Frank that it's over.

31:00.694 --> 31:03.094
That's what I'm going
to tell him when he gets here.

31:03.163 --> 31:05.393
You've got to get out
of here. Please.

31:05.498 --> 31:07.261
If he sees you here, he'll...

31:07.334 --> 31:08.301
What?

31:08.668 --> 31:10.158
He'll kill you.

31:10.503 --> 31:13.097
Well, that's the chance
I got to take.

31:13.206 --> 31:14.764
Because until I can
find him,

31:14.874 --> 31:17.934
until I find out what happened
at the dam out there,

31:18.011 --> 31:20.070
a very big piece
of my life is missing.

31:31.224 --> 31:34.216
Help! Somebody,
help! Please, help!

31:41.334 --> 31:43.097
KITT, I need you!

31:52.646 --> 31:55.274
He does choose the
most precarious locations.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.488
Michael, jump!

32:20.006 --> 32:22.099
Cara must have
called the police, KITT.

32:22.175 --> 32:23.540
I'm afraid so.

32:31.751 --> 32:34.345
You in the black car,
come out with your hands up.

33:10.357 --> 33:12.120
Does it always
get this heavy?

33:12.192 --> 33:14.057
When we get a moment,
I'll tell you stories

33:14.127 --> 33:15.924
that will stand
your hair on end.

33:17.664 --> 33:18.961
Well, I think we lost them.

33:19.032 --> 33:20.226
I'm afraid not.

33:20.300 --> 33:22.461
We've merely left
them somewhat behind.

33:23.903 --> 33:25.871
I never thought
I'd say this,

33:26.306 --> 33:27.364
but this is one time

33:27.474 --> 33:30.534
I'd like to see a couple
of black-and-whites disappear.

33:30.610 --> 33:32.578
Would you settle
for us disappearing?

33:33.380 --> 33:35.109
What have you got in mind?

33:35.548 --> 33:38.016
Don't tell me. Magic.

33:38.385 --> 33:41.149
Keep your eye on
the white handkerchief.

33:57.237 --> 33:59.501
Welcome to
the Foundation's mobile unit.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.136
Wow!

34:12.152 --> 34:14.347
You guys don't
fool around, do you?

34:14.420 --> 34:17.083
I hope. Are you
beginning to remember?

34:17.690 --> 34:19.282
Well, you came here.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.060
KITT brought me.
Well, I see.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.062
I was hoping
you'd acted on your own.

34:26.599 --> 34:29.591
Devon, before the explosion,

34:30.003 --> 34:31.436
were we friends?

34:31.504 --> 34:32.902
I'd like to think so.

34:33.873 --> 34:35.170
I'm glad to hear that.

34:35.542 --> 34:37.840
Oh. Michael,
this is a com-link.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.743
You had one before,

34:39.813 --> 34:41.713
but this one has
a boosted intake receptor.

34:41.781 --> 34:43.248
With this,
you can talk to KITT

34:43.315 --> 34:44.873
with less
structural interference.

34:44.951 --> 34:46.679
We don't want
to lose you again.

34:48.588 --> 34:50.453
I wish I could
remember you two.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.523
I really do.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.520
All right, KITT said the dam
was going to be demolished.

34:56.596 --> 34:59.394
I'd like to know all
there is to know about it.

34:59.499 --> 35:01.467
Like who bought
the hydraulic works?

35:01.835 --> 35:03.200
We'll check it out
for you.

35:03.303 --> 35:04.429
Seems to me
you're hooked up

35:04.504 --> 35:06.096
to every computer
in the world here.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.197
Think you could get me
some background information

35:08.308 --> 35:10.071
on one guy
named Frank Poole?

35:10.143 --> 35:12.134
Sure,
let's see what we've got.

35:19.953 --> 35:21.284
Frank Poole,

35:21.354 --> 35:23.584
a graduate student
in art at Reed College

35:23.656 --> 35:25.317
for about 10 years
on and off.

35:25.892 --> 35:28.053
He was a founder
of a radical political group

35:28.127 --> 35:29.594
and he has
three arrests.

35:29.662 --> 35:32.495
One for drugs,
and two for armed robbery.

35:33.032 --> 35:35.660
He won't let her go.
He'll kill her.

36:26.119 --> 36:28.451
Looks like you've chosen
sides, Cara.

36:32.892 --> 36:36.885
You and your friend Knight
are the only loose ends left.

36:39.132 --> 36:40.997
I'm gonna use you as bait.

36:41.734 --> 36:44.066
You're going to
bring him to me.

36:45.939 --> 36:47.770
And then
you're both gonna die.

37:26.179 --> 37:27.612
Cara.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.455
Michael, have you found her?

37:45.698 --> 37:46.824
KITT?

37:46.899 --> 37:48.093
Yes, Michael?

37:48.201 --> 37:49.862
Uh, no.

37:50.937 --> 37:51.961
She's gone.

37:52.071 --> 37:54.266
Looks like she left
in a real big hurry.

37:56.042 --> 37:57.304
Wait a minute.

37:58.478 --> 37:59.911
Bingo!

38:00.446 --> 38:02.380
Frank Poole was
an art student.

38:02.548 --> 38:03.913
He's probably got a studio.

38:03.983 --> 38:05.245
Can you get me
an address, KITT?

38:05.351 --> 38:06.841
Say no more, Michael.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.661
Looks like
it's remote control.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.461
Can you do
your magic on this one, KITT?

38:21.567 --> 38:23.034
With pleasure.

38:59.005 --> 39:01.405
This place doesn't
look like an art studio.

39:01.474 --> 39:03.942
It looks more like
an industrial accident.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.875
We're not here
to critique the work.

39:05.978 --> 39:07.605
Whatever happened to
the sensual lines

39:07.647 --> 39:08.739
of Henry Moore

39:08.815 --> 39:10.942
or the clean whimsy
of a Calder?

39:11.484 --> 39:14.476
Michael, I ask you,
is nothing sacred?

39:14.554 --> 39:17.523
It is grotesque
and absolutely humiliating.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.551
I kind of like it.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.922
Oh, really?

39:25.998 --> 39:27.659
Michael, look out!

39:35.508 --> 39:36.941
Thank you, Michael.

39:37.009 --> 39:38.840
You've improved it
immensely.

39:40.279 --> 39:41.837
I'll ask you only once.

39:41.914 --> 39:43.404
Where's Frank Poole?

39:43.483 --> 39:46.008
At the dam. But you
might as well forget it.

39:46.252 --> 39:48.152
The girl's as good
as dead by now.

39:59.265 --> 40:01.028
I got a hunch

40:01.134 --> 40:03.500
that door is not gonna
stand in our way.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.333
Michael, this is
beginning to sound like old times.

40:25.792 --> 40:27.316
Michael, I pride myself

40:27.393 --> 40:29.088
on never pointing out
the obvious

40:29.162 --> 40:31.562
but I'm afraid
we're driving into a trap.

40:31.631 --> 40:34.964
I'm not worried, KITT.
I have an edge.

40:35.568 --> 40:37.058
A secret weapon.

40:37.236 --> 40:38.760
Really? What is it?

40:38.938 --> 40:39.996
You.

40:46.846 --> 40:49.576
You know, I remember

40:50.883 --> 40:53.909
getting inside
the dam somewhere.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.316
There was an opening.
I'm sure of it.

40:58.491 --> 41:00.083
Michael,
I wish I could read minds

41:00.159 --> 41:02.650
but that's one power April
hasn't programmed me for.

41:02.728 --> 41:03.888
It's your turn.

41:03.963 --> 41:05.191
You must
remember what you did

41:05.298 --> 41:07.129
when you got to
the other side of the dam.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.360
Other side.

41:09.936 --> 41:11.995
The other side.
I think that's it, KITT.

41:24.183 --> 41:27.209
The door is on the other side.
I remember now.

41:27.286 --> 41:28.378
Scan inside the dam

41:28.454 --> 41:30.115
and see
if you can locate Cara.

41:30.890 --> 41:33.723
Something is still
interfering with my infrared, Michael.

41:33.793 --> 41:35.556
I can only create
an approximation

41:35.628 --> 41:37.653
based on water
and air displacement.

42:11.831 --> 42:13.162
Cara!

42:20.940 --> 42:22.168
Cara!

42:25.211 --> 42:27.179
Cara, can you hear me?

42:27.246 --> 42:29.305
Michael! Michael!

42:29.382 --> 42:30.474
Cara!

42:30.549 --> 42:31.709
Help!

42:32.351 --> 42:33.818
Help!

42:34.487 --> 42:35.818
Cara!

42:36.555 --> 42:38.182
You in there, Cara?

42:38.958 --> 42:40.152
Help!

42:40.426 --> 42:41.552
KITT!

42:42.295 --> 42:44.126
I'm in the hydraulic room.

42:44.196 --> 42:46.664
I can hear Cara.
Can you detect anything?

42:46.766 --> 42:49.360
Negative, Michael.
The dam is catacombed.

42:49.468 --> 42:51.561
That sound could
originate from anywhere.

42:54.173 --> 42:55.470
I remember.

42:56.542 --> 42:58.032
I remember now.

43:02.648 --> 43:04.775
KITT. I remember now.

43:05.251 --> 43:06.718
The gears are fake.

43:06.852 --> 43:08.342
Frank made them
out of Alidium.

43:08.421 --> 43:10.719
That's what's interfered
with reception, Michael.

43:10.790 --> 43:11.848
Alidium.

43:11.924 --> 43:13.448
According to
Devon's research,

43:13.526 --> 43:15.756
the hydraulics have been
sold to the Middle East.

43:15.828 --> 43:17.853
I bet that's how Frank
planned to get the Alidium

43:17.930 --> 43:19.989
out of the country.
Some peaceful purpose!

43:42.788 --> 43:44.255
KITT, I need you up here.

44:04.510 --> 44:05.738
Where is she?

44:05.811 --> 44:07.335
She's in a runoff pipe,

44:07.413 --> 44:09.108
deep in one
of the lock towers.

44:09.181 --> 44:12.150
Help yourself, man.
You'll never find her.

44:12.218 --> 44:13.742
Don't you count on it.

44:23.963 --> 44:26.898
KITT, you said you can pick
up any water displacement.

44:26.966 --> 44:28.957
Scan the dam for
any sudden activity.

44:34.407 --> 44:36.375
Michael, I've pinpointed it

44:36.442 --> 44:38.410
in a small pipe section
above the aqueduct.

44:38.511 --> 44:41.139
It's 15 feet in,
and it's filling with water.

44:42.114 --> 44:43.581
KITT, Cara's in there.

44:46.852 --> 44:48.649
We got to find a way
to break the pipe.

44:48.721 --> 44:50.188
Can you use a laser?

44:50.256 --> 44:51.553
It will take too long.

44:52.324 --> 44:54.121
If we hit the outside wall,

44:54.260 --> 44:56.160
wouldn't the impact
create a shock wave

44:56.228 --> 44:58.287
big enough
to shatter the pipe inside

44:58.364 --> 45:00.059
and let the water out?

45:00.132 --> 45:01.622
It would if I could
find a weak spot

45:01.734 --> 45:03.031
in the internal
wall structure,

45:03.135 --> 45:04.363
but it's a long shot.

45:04.470 --> 45:05.869
It's our only shot.

45:05.971 --> 45:07.939
I read you loud
and clear, Michael.

45:13.979 --> 45:16.413
I may have located
a weak spot, Michael.

45:16.482 --> 45:17.972
Let's go for it.

45:19.185 --> 45:21.983
Help! Help!

46:01.760 --> 46:02.954
Michael!

46:09.235 --> 46:11.203
It's okay. It's okay.

46:11.504 --> 46:14.803
Here you go.
It's okay. Come on.

46:14.874 --> 46:16.171
Come on.

46:17.176 --> 46:19.337
Yeah. It's okay.

46:20.713 --> 46:22.237
Good work, pal.

46:23.983 --> 46:25.473
It's all right.

46:39.031 --> 46:40.726
April, are you certain
you've packed

46:40.799 --> 46:42.198
the correct release forms?

46:42.301 --> 46:43.268
Positive, Devon.

46:43.369 --> 46:44.802
Everything you'll need
is in here.

46:44.870 --> 46:47.031
Good. But one
can't be too careful.

46:47.139 --> 46:48.936
Especially if one
is responsible

46:49.008 --> 46:51.568
for transferring the Alidium
to its rightful home.

46:52.178 --> 46:53.270
Hi!

46:53.879 --> 46:56.712
Just thought I'd come over
and say goodbye.

46:57.550 --> 46:58.983
Goodbye?

46:59.218 --> 47:01.652
Yeah, well,
you two can handle the trip.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.210
And my memory
is still not intact.

47:03.289 --> 47:04.688
I thought
I'd take a week or two

47:04.790 --> 47:06.519
and try
and straighten it out.

47:06.559 --> 47:09.858
Well, since you're still not
feeling up to par, of course.

47:10.429 --> 47:11.589
Thanks.

47:11.664 --> 47:13.393
I thought I'd go to the beach

47:13.465 --> 47:14.523
and try out

47:14.633 --> 47:16.225
some of my old
Swamp Fox techniques.

47:16.335 --> 47:19.304
Tracking, you know? Have fun.

47:20.839 --> 47:22.636
Devon, do you think

47:22.708 --> 47:24.300
he'll ever fully
regain his memory?

47:24.376 --> 47:26.003
It's hard to tell.

47:26.579 --> 47:28.604
These things have a way of...

47:29.048 --> 47:30.208
Swamp Fox!

47:30.282 --> 47:31.306
What?

47:31.383 --> 47:32.941
Why, that conniver!

47:33.886 --> 47:36.377
Don't you see?
He's fully recovered.

47:36.455 --> 47:39.015
He remembers everything.
He just wanted a vacation.

47:42.962 --> 47:44.486
Welcome back, Michael.

47:44.563 --> 47:46.656
I thought as a present
I'd play you

47:46.732 --> 47:48.757
some of that appalling music
you like so much.

47:48.867 --> 47:50.027
Thanks, buddy.

47:50.469 --> 47:53.597
Come on,
let's shatter some airwaves.

47:56.242 --> 47:57.834
You know, I've been thinking.

47:58.143 --> 48:01.135
I could have April install
an electronic board in here

48:01.213 --> 48:03.044
and she could hook it
up to your speakers.

48:03.115 --> 48:04.104
Michael.

48:04.183 --> 48:05.150
Yeah, KITT?

48:05.251 --> 48:06.445
Don't press your luck.

48:06.485 --> 48:08.009
Whatever you say, pal.

48:08.787 --> 48:10.254
Whatever you say.
