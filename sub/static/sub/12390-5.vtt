WEBVTT

00:07.940 --> 00:09.362
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING TO ME.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.002
WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO YOU, SHAWN?

00:11.040 --> 00:12.439
ONLY THE WORST THING EVER!

00:12.480 --> 00:15.608
A MISSING CAPTAIN DELICIOUS
MAGIC MOOD RING!

00:15.640 --> 00:17.403
DAD, THIS IS A CRIME.

00:17.450 --> 00:18.940
CAN YOU HAVE THEM
ARRESTED?

00:18.980 --> 00:21.210
FIRST OF ALL, SHAWN, NO,
THIS IS NOT A CRIME.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.547
CAN'T YOU JUST HAUL THEM IN
FOR QUESTIONING?

00:22.590 --> 00:23.284
LAY INTO THEM A LITTLE?

00:23.320 --> 00:24.344
AND WHO IS "THEM"?

00:24.390 --> 00:26.654
YOU KNOW, THE CEREAL PEOPLE?

00:26.690 --> 00:28.555
OH, THE CEREAL PEOPLE, HUH?

00:28.590 --> 00:30.126
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT, SHAWN.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.993
YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME
CALLING 411

00:33.030 --> 00:34.520
TO GET THE NUMBER
FOR YOUR CEREAL PEOPLE.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.822
THEY'RE GOING TO STICK YOU
ON HOLD FOREVER,

00:35.860 --> 00:37.828
LISTENING TO BAD MUSIC,

00:37.870 --> 00:39.098
FINALLY YOU'RE GOING TO GET
SOME DIM-WI'ITED SECRETARY

00:39.140 --> 00:40.061
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE
YOUR MESSAGE,

00:40.100 --> 00:41.829
AND THEN SHE'S GOING
TO THROW IT

00:41.870 --> 00:44.566
IN A WASTEBUCKET.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.498
OR YOU CAN USE
THE SKILLS I TAUGHT YOU,

00:52.580 --> 00:53.740
WHAT AM I MISSING?

00:56.720 --> 00:57.846
WHERE IS THE RING?

00:57.890 --> 00:59.983
WELL, IT'D BE AT THE BOTTOM...

01:00.020 --> 01:01.214
NOT OF THIS BOX.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.148
THE BIG OLD BAD CEREAL
COMPANY MESSED UP.

01:03.190 --> 01:05.078
SO YOU GRAB ANOTHER BOX.
TOUGH LUCK.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.392
WHERE'S THE RING NOW?

01:06.430 --> 01:07.829
AT THE BOTTOM.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.590
NOW I'VE GOT TO
EAT THE WHOLE BOX.

01:12.170 --> 01:13.068
AND WHERE'S THE RING NOW?

01:13.100 --> 01:14.795
AT THE TOP!

01:14.840 --> 01:16.569
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SEE,
SOMETIMES, SHAWN,

01:16.610 --> 01:18.100
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DIG SO DEEP.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.005
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
IS TURN SOMETHING UPSIDE DOWN

01:20.040 --> 01:21.735
TO MAKE IT RIGHT-SIDE UP,
AND THEN...

01:25.280 --> 01:26.611
YOU GET YOUR PRIZE.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.618
THAN KS, DAD!

01:29.950 --> 01:31.417
EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN

01:31.450 --> 01:32.587
WHY WE COULDN'T SIT
IN A RESTAURANT

01:32.620 --> 01:34.485
AND EAT
LIKE CIVILIZED PEOPLE.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.420
MOVING IS GOOD, GUS.
IT HELPS THE DIGESTION.

01:36.460 --> 01:37.984
PLUS, YOU AND I NEVER
DO THIS ANYMORE.

01:38.030 --> 01:39.327
WHAT, EAT AND JOG?

01:39.360 --> 01:40.395
NO, TALK. JUST TALK.

01:40.430 --> 01:43.490
CHECK IN WITH EACH OTHER
AS MEN.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.225
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU ARE.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.329
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW GUS IS.

01:47.370 --> 01:49.099
REALLY? LIKE YOU'RE
REALLY ASKING ME?

01:49.140 --> 01:51.529
YES, I'M REALLY ASKING,
BECAUSE I CARE.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.276
WOW. OKAY.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.631
WE'VE BEEN WORKING CASES
NONSTOP FOR A MONTH.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.545
TO BE HONEST, I'M BURNT.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.741
I JUST WANT TO TAKE A NAP.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.145
I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE, BUDDY.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.317
I THINK WE SHOULD
LAY LOW FOR A BIT.

02:02.350 --> 02:03.317
NO MORE CASES.

02:03.350 --> 02:04.510
OH, I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.609
I WAS KIND OF WORRIED
ABOUT TELLING YOU.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.049
DON'T BE A SILLY GOOSE.

02:09.090 --> 02:10.455
NOW, WE'VE HAD
A GOOD TALK,

02:10.490 --> 02:11.752
I THINK
WE BOTH FELT IT,

02:11.790 --> 02:12.393
AND LOOK AT THIS.

02:12.430 --> 02:14.318
HERE WE ARE.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.465
WHAT IS THIS, SHAWN?

02:19.500 --> 02:20.535
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.902
THE POLICE MAY HAVE
FOUND A BODY,

02:22.940 --> 02:24.259
WHICH I MAY HAVE
PICKED UP

02:24.310 --> 02:25.368
ON MY POLICE SCANNER,

02:25.410 --> 02:29.107
WHICH I MAY HAVE
BROUGHT WITH ME.

02:29.140 --> 02:30.038
NO CASES, SHAWN.

02:30.080 --> 02:30.808
NO CASES.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.101
WE GO IN, WE SEE,

02:32.150 --> 02:33.549
WE SAY HELLO, AND WE LEAVE.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.979
SAY HELLO?
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.487
YOU CAN'T JUST
WALK IN THERE.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.715
MCNAB!

02:38.750 --> 02:39.284
NABBY!

02:39.320 --> 02:40.309
[TO GUS]: BUZZ.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.626
BUZZ? SERIOUSLY?

02:42.660 --> 02:43.922
DON'T YOU EVER
TALK TO HIM?

02:43.960 --> 02:45.359
WHY WOULD I TALK TO
ANYBODY NAMED BUZZ?

02:45.390 --> 02:47.950
SHAWN! MY MAN!

02:48.000 --> 02:50.389
POW!

02:50.430 --> 02:52.796
OKAY WITH...YES.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.899
YOU LOOK TRIM.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.703
SOMEBODY MADE THEIR
WEDDING WEIGHT.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.002
FIVE MORE POUNDS.
I'M CLOSE.

02:58.040 --> 02:58.961
BUT I STILL
HAVE A MONTH.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.409
YOU'LL GET THERE.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.930
YOU REMEMBER MY PARTNER?

03:01.980 --> 03:03.607
SURE, YEAH...
MATT, RIGHT?

03:03.650 --> 03:04.969
GUS.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.409
RIGHT.

03:06.450 --> 03:07.872
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
GOING ON UP THERE?

03:07.920 --> 03:09.046
DON'T HOLD OUT ON ME, NOW.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.308
LOOKS LIKE
SUICIDE.

03:10.350 --> 03:11.612
THE GUY FROM THE PHONE COMPANY

03:11.650 --> 03:12.958
FOUND THE VICTIM
IN HIS APARTMENT.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.252
BEEN UP THERE
FOR A FEW DAYS ALREADY.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.359
A FEW DAYS?

03:15.390 --> 03:16.948
YOU MIND IF WE HEAD UP,
TAKE A LOOK,

03:16.990 --> 03:17.957
POKE AROUND A LITTLE?

03:17.990 --> 03:19.355
AW, I DON'T KNOW.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.628
LASSITER'S UP THERE,

03:20.660 --> 03:22.025
AND HE'S
IN A MOOD.

03:22.060 --> 03:24.665
YEAH, WE JUST...
WE GOT HIS COFFEE.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.997
WANT TO BRING IT BY,
MAKE IT RIGHT.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.031
OH, THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.196
HE ASKED ME TO GET IT,
BUT...

03:29.340 --> 03:31.729
BUT THIS IS PERFECT.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.138
HEY, DID YOU JUST SIP THAT?

03:34.180 --> 03:36.705
YOU DON'T TASTE
LASSITER'S COFFEE

03:36.750 --> 03:38.377
BEFORE YOU GIVE IT TO HIM?

03:38.410 --> 03:39.946
THAT SURPRISES ME,
BUZZ.

03:39.980 --> 03:42.039
HE'S SO PARTICULAR,
WITH NO CREAM, NO SUGAR...

03:42.080 --> 03:43.741
IT'S THREE CREAMS, FOUR SUGARS.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.781
YEAH, IT IS.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.613
SHARP AS A TACK!

03:48.660 --> 03:49.456
YOU!

03:49.490 --> 03:52.425
AND FIT!

04:04.970 --> 04:06.107
WE FOUND A NOTE.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.279
THE BODY'S BEEN HERE
AT LEAST THREE DAYS.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.540
ALL SIGNS POINT
TO AN 11-44.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.616
THREE 11-445
IN FOUR MONTHS?

04:12.650 --> 04:15.175
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
IN THE WATER.

04:15.220 --> 04:16.517
ALL RIGHT, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, LISTEN UP.

04:16.550 --> 04:18.438
YOU KNOW THE PROCEDURE.
I WANT THIS DONE RIGHT.

04:18.490 --> 04:21.357
I DO NOT WANT ANY MISTAKES.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.019
HEY, BLOWIE.

04:25.060 --> 04:26.425
I KNOW YOU'RE NEW,

04:26.460 --> 04:27.529
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO GET YOUR SPIT

04:27.560 --> 04:28.492
ALL OVER THE EVIDENCE,

04:28.530 --> 04:30.760
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LICK IT?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.097
CLEARLY HE DOESN'T NEED
ANY MORE COFFEE.

04:32.130 --> 04:33.563
OKAY, THERE'S
THE DEAD GUY.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.669
CAN WE GO NOW?

04:34.700 --> 04:35.837
RELAX.
WE JUST GOT HERE.

04:35.870 --> 04:37.064
HAVE SOME MEE KROB.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.168
HOW DO YOU JUST EAT

04:38.210 --> 04:39.370
WHEN THERE'S A DEAD GUY
LAYING THERE?

04:39.410 --> 04:42.846
WHAT, IS THAT RUDE?
AM I SUPPOSE TO SHARE?

04:42.880 --> 04:43.642
FORENSICS.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.318
ACT NATURAL.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.809
OH, THAT'S IT!

04:51.850 --> 04:52.953
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.018
RED PEPPER FLAKES.

04:56.220 --> 04:57.187
IS THAT A CLUE
OR SOMETHING?

04:57.230 --> 04:58.629
NO, IT'S A DELICIOUS SPICE

04:58.660 --> 05:00.298
AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
MY MEE KROB NEEDS.

05:00.330 --> 05:03.163
I TOLD YOU THIS.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.521
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

05:05.570 --> 05:06.537
YOU CAN'T TOUCH STUFF.

05:10.370 --> 05:11.507
WHAT?

05:16.610 --> 05:18.646
SERIOUSLY,
CHECK THIS OUT.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.119
A MARI NATING STEAK?

05:23.150 --> 05:24.686
WHAT, YOU WANT
TO EAT THAT TOO?

05:24.720 --> 05:26.142
NO, BUT DON'T YOU FIND
THAT A LITTLE ODD?

05:26.190 --> 05:28.010
THAT A MAN WOULD
EAT A STEAK?

05:28.060 --> 05:29.209
THAT A MAN WHO WAS READY
TO KILL HIMSELF

05:29.260 --> 05:30.921
WOULD TAKE THE TIME
TO MARINATE A STEAK

05:30.960 --> 05:34.191
FOR A FUTURE MEAL?

05:35.660 --> 05:38.220
DUDE...

05:38.270 --> 05:40.295
THIS WAS NOT SUICIDE.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.659
THIS WAS MURDER.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.211
THE DOOR LATCH IS STILL INTACT.

05:57.620 --> 05:58.689
NOW, I ASK YOU,

05:58.720 --> 06:00.187
IF YOU WERE GONNA KILL YOURSELF,

06:00.220 --> 06:01.448
WOULDN'T YOU WANT
THE DOOR TO BE LOCKED

06:01.490 --> 06:04.152
SO NO ONE COULD BARGE IN ON YOU?

06:04.190 --> 06:06.420
WHAT?

06:06.460 --> 06:08.496
I DON'T--WHAT IS--
I DON'T--

06:08.530 --> 06:09.565
WHAT IN THE NAME
OF SWEET JUSTICE

06:09.600 --> 06:10.669
ARE YOU TWO DOING

06:10.700 --> 06:11.962
IN MY CRIME SCENE?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.228
YOUR CRIME SCENE?

06:13.270 --> 06:14.430
THAT'S FUNNY.
I DIDN'T SEE YOUR NAME ON IT.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.062
HEH HEH. GET OUT.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.203
WE ARE.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.332
JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW

06:18.370 --> 06:20.975
THAT THIS THING HERE,
NOT A SUICIDE.

06:21.010 --> 06:23.240
GREAT.
THANKS FOR THAT. REALLY.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.305
AND THANKS ALSO FOR BRINGING
A SNACK TO THE CRIME SCENE.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.484
OH, BOY!

06:35.860 --> 06:37.157
I'M SENSING A...

06:37.190 --> 06:39.920
I'M SENSING THERE WAS
SOMEONE HERE,

06:39.960 --> 06:41.222
SOMEONE HERE
IN THE ROOM

06:41.260 --> 06:42.568
WITH THE VICTIM
WHEN HE DIED.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.764
SOMEONE WITH A SLIVER OF GREASE
ON HIS OR HER SHOE.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.564
NO, I'M NOT SENSING
A STRUGGLE.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.804
NO STRUGGLE...

06:52.170 --> 06:54.730
[BANGING]

06:54.780 --> 06:55.906
THE DOOR.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.472
DID YOU HAVE TO BREAK DOWN
THE DOOR WHEN YOU GOT HERE?

06:58.510 --> 06:59.477
NO, IT WAS OPEN. WHY?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.441
NO, NO, NO,

07:00.480 --> 07:01.515
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

07:01.550 --> 07:02.744
GET UP.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.644
MCNAB, I WANT YOU TO ESCORT
THESE TWO MEN

07:04.690 --> 07:06.282
OUT OF HERE NOW.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.412
OH, COME ON.
LET ME READ THE WITNESSES.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.279
YOU KNOW, DUE DILIGENCE.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.185
SPENCER, WE DID
THE DUE DILIGENCE.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.356
IT WAS A SUICIDE.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.994
THERE IS NO CRIME.
THERE ARE NO WITNESSES.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.156
YOU'RE WRONG.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.054
THERE IS A WITNESS.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.968
THERE'S A CAT.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.560
I WANT TO TALK TO THAT CAT.

07:25.110 --> 07:29.479
AS SOON AS HE'S FINISHED...
LICKING HIMSELF.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.912
WOW. I'M JEALOUS.

07:36.890 --> 07:40.212
[***]

07:40.260 --> 07:44.424
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

07:44.460 --> 07:47.099
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

07:47.130 --> 07:48.893
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

07:48.930 --> 07:50.568
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

07:50.600 --> 07:52.420
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

07:52.470 --> 07:55.234
* THEY WILL PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END **

08:01.610 --> 08:03.043
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOOK THAT CAT.

08:03.080 --> 08:03.842
GUS, THEY WERE GOING
TO SHIP HIM OFF

08:03.880 --> 08:05.040
TO AN ANIMAL SHELTER.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.240
WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE?

08:06.280 --> 08:07.611
PLUS THIS CAT
IS THE LEAD WITNESS

08:07.650 --> 08:09.015
IN A MAJOR MURDER
INVESTIGATION.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.017
YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?

08:10.050 --> 08:11.688
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.711
YOU TOOK THE CAT,
YOU CARRY IT.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.489
WE'RE RIGHT ON
THIS THING NOW.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.385
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.454
A STEAK?

08:18.490 --> 08:19.593
THE CHAIN IN THE DOOR?
A STAIN ON THE CARPET?

08:19.630 --> 08:20.824
I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED ME.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.566
WE NEEDED AN "IN,"
NOW WE HAVE ONE,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.625
PLUS HE CLEARLY LIKES YOU.
GIVE HIM A SNUGGLE.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.092
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
GOING TO ENJOY THIS,

08:26.130 --> 08:27.267
YOU HAVING
TO CARRY THIS CAT AROUND,

08:27.300 --> 08:29.291
PRETENDING YOU CAN
COMMUNICATE WITH IT.

08:29.340 --> 08:30.705
I'M BUYING A DISPOSABLE CAMERA

08:30.740 --> 08:31.638
FOR WHEN YOU HAVE
TO CLEAN OUT

08:31.670 --> 08:32.409
HIS DIRTY LITTER BOX.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.930
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.301
THIS CAT HERE IS A GIFT,

08:36.340 --> 08:37.568
A CONDUIT FOR US
TO SAVE LIVES,

08:37.610 --> 08:40.340
AND HE HAS MORE INTEGRITY
IN HIS LITTLE FURRY HAND...

08:40.380 --> 08:41.711
PAW.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.342
PAW, THAN MOST PEOPLE
HAVE IN THEIR WHOLE...

08:43.390 --> 08:44.641
APPENDAGES...

08:46.960 --> 08:48.257
APPENDAGES.

08:48.290 --> 08:48.688
WHAT?

08:48.720 --> 08:49.857
ALL OF...

08:49.890 --> 08:53.690
THAN MOST PEOPLE HAVE IN ALL
OF THEIR APPENDAGES...

08:53.730 --> 08:54.697
COMBINED.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.067
OH YEAH?

08:57.100 --> 08:59.091
I THINK HE WANTS
TO SLEEP ON YOUR CHAIR.

08:59.130 --> 09:00.563
HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO KEEP THIS UP FOR?

09:00.600 --> 09:03.330
UNTIL WE SOLVE THE CRIME.

09:03.370 --> 09:04.837
DON'T YOU OR YOUR CAT
GET MAD AT ME,

09:04.870 --> 09:06.337
BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE WAS A CRIME.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.008
OH, REALLY?
YOU DON'T THINK SO?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.439
TRY TELLING THAT
TO THIS POOR LITTLE GUY,

09:09.480 --> 09:11.175
WHO WAS TRAUMATIZED
SEEING HIS OWNER KILLED.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.770
TELL HIM.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.310
I'M JUST SAYING I CAN KINDA GET
WHERE LASSITER IS COMING FROM.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.658
A FEW SUICIDES IS NOT UNCOMMON.

09:19.690 --> 09:22.284
GUS, DID YOU LOOK
AT THE SKY TODAY?

09:22.320 --> 09:24.083
BLUE, CLEAR...

09:24.130 --> 09:25.552
AND DID YOU FEEL IT
OUT THERE?

09:25.590 --> 09:28.457
WARM. NICE. STATISTICALLY,
PEOPLE IN MILD CLIMATES

09:28.500 --> 09:30.968
ARE FAR LESS LIKELY
TO KILL THEMSELVES.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.365
NOW, IF WE WERE
IN VLADIVOSTOK,

09:32.400 --> 09:34.095
WE COULD TALK.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.289
THE POINT IS,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

09:35.340 --> 09:38.503
THIS WAS A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN
LIVING ALONE WITH A CAT.

09:38.540 --> 09:40.030
OH. OH.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.206
DO YOU WANT DOWN?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.049
YOU CAN GET DOWN.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.019
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.189
I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.018
IT'S PROBABLY A SUICIDE.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.823
THANK YOU.

09:56.860 --> 09:59.078
THAT WAS BIG OF YOU TO ADMIT.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.995
I'M UNCLEAR
ON ONE LITTLE THING.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.861
WHAT'S THAT?

10:02.900 --> 10:05.960
HOW DO WE EXPLAIN
THE SECOND BODY THEY JUST FOUND?

10:13.480 --> 10:14.879
DETECTIVE O'HARA.

10:14.910 --> 10:16.309
WELL, YOU'RE HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

10:19.480 --> 10:20.674
AH.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.318
DAMN IT ALL.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.983
COULD HAVE HAPPENED
TO ANYBODY.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.021
TALK TO ME.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.527
WELL, VICTIM IS A FEMALE
IN HER LATE 20$,

10:31.560 --> 10:32.925
GLORIA STARKS.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.427
WE'RE WAITING FOR
FORENSICS TO CONFIRM,

10:34.460 --> 10:35.996
BUT IT APPEARS TO BE
A SUICIDE.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.292
CARBON MONOXIDE
POISONING.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.399
ASPHYXIATION.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.796
OOH, I'M AFRAID
THE CAT DOESN'T THINK SO.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.432
TURN AROUND AND WALK AWAY.

10:42.470 --> 10:43.630
THIS CAT CAN TELL US

10:43.670 --> 10:45.501
IF THE KILLER HAS BEEN HERE.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.030
ALL I NEED IS 30 SECONDS.
WATCH THIS.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.229
YOU READY, BOY?
HUH? YOU READY?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.145
WHAT? WHAT, OVER HERE?
WHERE?

10:50.180 --> 10:52.068
WHAT...

10:52.110 --> 10:54.476
THAT IS--

10:54.520 --> 10:55.817
THAT IS VERY THOUGHTFUL.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.283
I'LL TELL HIM.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.582
HE SAYS THE FACT
THAT YOU TAKE

10:58.620 --> 11:00.451
THREE CREAMS AND FOUR SUGARS
IN YOUR COFFEE?

11:00.490 --> 11:01.559
DANGEROUS.

11:01.590 --> 11:02.852
IS THAT TRUE?

11:02.890 --> 11:03.879
DO YOU REALLY TAKE
THREE CREAMS

11:03.930 --> 11:04.851
AND FOUR SUGARS?

11:04.890 --> 11:06.027
SO WHAT?

11:06.060 --> 11:08.051
THAT IS A HEART ATTACK
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.829
YOU'RE STILL A YOUNG MAN.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.326
THAT WAS AMAZING.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

11:11.370 --> 11:12.394
IT WAS A LUCKY GUESS.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.636
DON'T YOU GET TIRED
OF SAYING THAT?

11:13.670 --> 11:15.831
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I'D LIKE THE LITTLE BOY CAT

11:15.870 --> 11:18.065
TO SNIFF OUT THE CAR.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.509
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

11:21.540 --> 11:22.199
OOPS!

11:23.510 --> 11:24.977
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

11:25.010 --> 11:26.648
JUST RELAX AND LET
HIM DO HIS JOB.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.079
HE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.646
HE'S PEEING.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.057
NO.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.284
NO, HE'S DRAWING YOUR ATTENTION

11:38.330 --> 11:39.820
TO THE EVIDENCE
IN THE BACK SEAT.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.725
BY PEEING ON IT.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.920
NICE.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.564
COME HERE, KITTY, KITTY, KITTY.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.760
NICE KITTY.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.939
YES, DID YOU MAKE GOOD PEE-PEE?

11:48.970 --> 11:50.005
DID YOU MAKE
GOOD PEE-PEE?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.007
YES, YOU DID.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.029
WHAT?

11:54.910 --> 11:57.276
THAT'S--THAT'S
A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.310
I'M SORRY,
THAT'S RUDE.

12:01.350 --> 12:02.476
HE WAS JUST SAYING

12:02.520 --> 12:03.441
THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING

12:03.490 --> 12:05.139
IF HE'D KILLED
HIMSELF.

12:05.190 --> 12:06.953
HE WOULD HAVE
SWUNG BY THE DRY CLEANER'S

12:06.990 --> 12:09.117
AND GRABBED THE PANTSUIT FIRST.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.025
MAYBE SHE PICKED UP
THE DRY CLEANING

12:11.060 --> 12:12.288
DAYS AGO.

12:12.330 --> 12:13.319
DID THE CAT EVER THINK OF THAT?

12:13.360 --> 12:15.191
WHAT IS HE DOING
RIGHT HERE?

12:15.230 --> 12:16.424
HE IS MEASURING

12:16.460 --> 12:18.769
THE AMOUNT
OF CARBON MONOXIDE EMITTED.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.468
OKAY. I KNEW THAT.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.206
[SHAWN]:
YEAH, YOU DID.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.333

12:27.980 --> 12:29.402
WHOA!

12:31.750 --> 12:33.115
NOW, DOES SHE STRIKE YOU

12:33.150 --> 12:35.618
AS THE TYPE
THAT WOULD GO FOR HEAW METAL?

12:35.650 --> 12:36.878
ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE

12:36.920 --> 12:38.217
COULD HAVE CHANGED
HER RADIO STATION.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.888
MR. SPENCER,
IF YOU AND YOUR NEW PARTNER

12:39.920 --> 12:41.387
ARE FINISHED
URINATING ON THINGS,

12:41.420 --> 12:42.853
I BELIEVE
YOUR WORK HERE IS DONE.

12:44.990 --> 12:45.979
CHECK OUT
THE DRY CLEANING.

12:46.030 --> 12:47.725
I'M ON IT.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.799
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT LASSITER SAYS,

12:51.830 --> 12:53.798
THE CAT
IS NOT MY NEW PARTNER, GUS.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.068
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.136
THEN TELL ME AGAIN WHY THE CAT
GETS TO RIDE SHOTGUN.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.967
HE GETS CAR SICK,
AND YOU KNOW THIS.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.807
DO YOU WANT HIM TO THROW
UP AGAIN BACK THERE?

13:00.840 --> 13:02.307
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

13:02.340 --> 13:04.399
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, SHAWN.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.940

13:05.980 --> 13:07.868
HE'S DOING FINE. AREN'T YOU?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.569
[GUS]:
THIS IS A COMPANY CAR, SHAWN.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.611
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO RETURN IT
IN LIKE-NEW CONDITION.

13:11.650 --> 13:12.617
LAY THESE DOWN.

13:19.060 --> 13:20.027

13:33.840 --> 13:35.705

I DON'T THINK SO.

13:35.740 --> 13:37.879
OKAY, YOU MIGHT BE ON
TO SOMETHING.

13:37.910 --> 13:40.470

A QUESTION.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.222
I COULD REALLY USE SOME ADVICE.

TWO OF WHICH OCCURRED
BEFORE WE CAME ON THE CASE,

17:14.360 --> 17:15.520
AND I DON'T SEE A PATTERN
OF ANY KIND.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.290
DIFFERENT AGES,
DIFFERENT SEXES.

17:18.330 --> 17:19.695
DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC LEVELS.

17:19.730 --> 17:20.958
DIFFERENT METHODS OF DEATH.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.991
NO DUPLICATE WEAPONS, LOCATIONS.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.860
WHAT DO WE GOT?

17:24.910 --> 17:26.309
FIRST WE HAVE A JUMPER,

17:26.340 --> 17:29.901
SECOND, AN OVEN, THIRD, PILLS,
FOURTH, CARBON MONOXIDE.

17:29.940 --> 17:32.909
THEY ALL HAVE TO BE CONNECTED
SOMEHOW.

17:32.950 --> 17:34.542
WHAT I SEE
IS A WHOLE LOT OF NOTHING.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.912
NOTHING.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.345
YOU SEE, SOMETIMES, SHAWN,

17:39.390 --> 17:40.687
YOU DON'T NEED TO DIG SO DEEP.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.951
YOU JUST NEED
TO TURN THINGS UPSIDE DOWN...

17:43.990 --> 17:46.823
TO MAKE THEM RIGHT-SIDE UP.

17:46.860 --> 17:49.226
AND THERE'S YOUR PRIZE.

17:52.870 --> 17:54.565
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.539
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:59.570 --> 18:01.401
I'M TURNING THINGS UPSIDE DOWN

18:01.440 --> 18:08.141
IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM
RIGHT-SIDE UP.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.239
AND THERE'S THE PRIZE.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.686
[GUS]: THIS IS THE PRIZE?

18:14.720 --> 18:16.688
GOING TO THE FIRST
DEAD GUY'S PLACE, AND WHAT?

18:16.720 --> 18:17.857
TALK TO A DEAD GUY?

18:17.890 --> 18:20.120
NO, WE TALK
TO DEAD GUY'S BROTHER.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.991
THE DEAD GUY'S BROTHER LIVES
AT THE DEAD GUY'S PLACE?

18:22.030 --> 18:24.498
THEY WERE ROOMMATES,
BUT THAT'S THE POINT.

18:24.530 --> 18:26.896
HE'S GETTING RID
OF THE APARTMENT,

18:26.930 --> 18:27.999
AND WE'RE HERE TO RENT IT.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.929
WE'RE WHAT?

18:33.010 --> 18:34.307
WHY CAN'T WE FOR ONCE

18:34.340 --> 18:35.307
JUST TALK
TO SOMEBODY AS US?

18:35.340 --> 18:36.204
BECAUSE, GUS,

18:36.240 --> 18:37.377
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO BE ON GUARD.

18:37.410 --> 18:38.445
IF HE THINKS WE'RE
INVESTIGATING SOMETHING,

18:38.480 --> 18:40.311
HE'LL CLAM UP.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.749
WES HILTON BOCK.

18:42.780 --> 18:43.849
YEAH.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.118
HEY, SHAWN SPENCER.

18:45.150 --> 18:46.412
I TALKED TO YOU
ON THE PHONE

18:46.450 --> 18:47.417
ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.415
THIS IS GUS.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.415
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE
FOR BOTH OF US.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.156
YEAH. OKAY, COME IN.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.021
THAN KS, MAN.

18:59.130 --> 19:01.792
JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW,
THE UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED,

19:01.840 --> 19:03.330
BUT I WOULD REQUIRE

19:03.370 --> 19:06.498
FIRST AND LAST MONTH
AND A SIZABLE SECURITY DEPOSIT.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.939
OH, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.174
DO YOU TAKE CATS?

19:09.210 --> 19:11.371
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.719
YOU TWO GUYS HAVE A CAT?

19:13.750 --> 19:15.570
WE DO, ACTUALLY.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.588
HE'S SORT OF
LIKE OUR CHILD.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.588
I SEE.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.848
HOW DO YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

19:20.890 --> 19:22.357
WE'RE PARTNERS.

19:22.390 --> 19:23.755
GOTCHA.

19:23.790 --> 19:25.428
OH, NO, NO--

19:25.460 --> 19:26.586
NO, NO, IT'S FINE.

19:26.630 --> 19:27.722
REALLY, I'M TOTALLY FINE.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.955
NO. WE'RE PARTNERS
IN A PRIVATE--

19:30.000 --> 19:32.093
RELATIONSHIP.
BELIEVE IT.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.132
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

19:34.170 --> 19:36.161
WE FINISH
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.201
SO, TELL ME, WES,

19:37.240 --> 19:39.037
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO GIVE UP

19:39.070 --> 19:40.378
SUCH A HANDSOME APARTMENT?

19:40.410 --> 19:45.200
DO YOU NOT LIKE IT ANYMORE?

19:45.250 --> 19:47.673
OOH! GUS!

19:48.780 --> 19:51.385
GOOD NEWS.
SHOWER FOR TWO.

19:54.490 --> 19:56.708
UH, ACTUALLY, I JUST HAVE

19:56.760 --> 19:58.079
SOME BAD
MEMORIES HERE.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.688
I USED TO LIVE HERE
WITH MY BROTHER,

19:59.730 --> 20:00.992
BUT HE PASSED AWAY.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.099
[SHAWN]:
OH, I'M SORRY, MAN.

20:02.130 --> 20:04.189
WAS HE SICK, OR?

20:04.230 --> 20:05.561
HE KILLED HIMSELF.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.158
OH, GOOD LORD.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.167
I'M SO SORRY.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.462
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.762
YEAH, ME TOO.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.302
WE WERE REAL CLOSE,
YOU KNOW.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.274
WAS HE DEPRESSED?

20:16.310 --> 20:17.971
I MEAN, WERE THERE SIGNS?

20:18.010 --> 20:19.045
DID YOU--

20:19.080 --> 20:20.877
WHAT AM I-- I'M SORRY.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.319
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.

20:22.350 --> 20:23.908
NO.

20:23.950 --> 20:27.044
ACTUALLY, I HAD NO IDEA
ANYTHING WAS WRONG, YOU KNOW.

20:27.090 --> 20:28.978
I MEAN, HE HAD
SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.228
HE'S A GREAT GUY,
YOU KNOW.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.353
SMARTER THAN ME, MORE TALENTED.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.493
HE WAS A GREAT SINGER.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.623
HE WAS REALLY GOING PLACES.

20:41.670 --> 20:44.434
SO, LOOK, ARE YOU GUYS
INTERESTED IN THE PLACE, OR?

20:44.470 --> 20:46.438
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, HONEY?

20:46.470 --> 20:48.108
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

20:48.140 --> 20:49.107
I THINK IT'S PERFECT.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.368
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

20:50.410 --> 20:51.900
I'VE GOT ANOTHER COUPLE
COMING BY LATER,

20:51.950 --> 20:53.679
SO...

20:53.720 --> 20:55.176
BUT I'LL LET YOU GUYS KNOW
EITHER WAY.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.949
SHOWER FOR TWO?

20:56.980 --> 20:58.618
THAT WAS SO I COULD
SEE YOUR FACE WHEN I SAID IT.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.811
YOU KNOW, YOU ENJOY THESE THINGS
MORE THAN YOU SHOULD.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.350
I SUFFERED THROUGH
THAT FOR NO REASON.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.926
WE LEARNED NOTHING.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.382
YES, BUT I GRABBED THIS
WHILE WE WERE UP THERE.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.819
YOU TOOK HIS MAIL?

21:07.860 --> 21:09.191
IT'S NOT LIKE I TOOK
HIS SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.561
IT'S A PHONE BILL.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.567
YOU CAN'T OPEN
SOMEONE'S ELSE'S MAIL.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.567
IT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE!

21:12.600 --> 21:13.464
GUS, HE'S DEAD.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.762
SO WHAT?

21:14.800 --> 21:18.304
I'LL HOLD IT TO MY HEAD
AND READ IT PSYCHICALLY.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.602
HURRY UP, SHAWN.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.777
GUS, WHO'S GOING TO SEE US?

21:20.810 --> 21:22.038
HURRY UP.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.299
WHY, THERE'S LIKE--

21:25.350 --> 21:28.717
THERE'S LIKE 16 CALLS HERE
TO SOME 1-800 STRESS LINE...

21:28.750 --> 21:30.274
INCLUDING THE LAST CALL HE MADE.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.242
I'VE SEEN THE ADS FOR THAT.
SO WHAT?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.053
A DEPRESSED GUY
CALLS A STRESS LINE.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.183
I BETCHA A HUNGRY GUY
CALLS A PIZZA PLACE.

21:36.220 --> 21:37.255
THAT DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING.

21:37.290 --> 21:39.121
YEAH, BUT IT MIGHT
GET US A LINK.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.149
I'M GONNA RUN

21:40.190 --> 21:41.396
THE OTHER VICTIMS'
PHONE RECORDS.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.829
WITH WHAT?

21:42.860 --> 21:44.361
YOUR DO-IT-YOURSELF
PHONE RECORD RUNNING KIT?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.391
THE NEXT BEST THING.

21:49.270 --> 21:52.433
THE ANSWER IS IN
THE PHONE BILLS.

21:52.470 --> 21:53.630
I NEED YOU TO RUN

21:53.680 --> 21:54.931
THE VICTIMS'
PHONE RECORDS.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.971
WHAT? NO CAT THIS TIME?

21:57.010 --> 21:59.103
I HAVE A STRONG SENSE
ABOUT A STRESS LINE,

21:59.150 --> 22:01.118
AND I KNOW THE LINK
IS IN THE PHONE RECORDS.

22:01.150 --> 22:02.617
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD THINK

22:02.650 --> 22:03.878
I WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR YOU.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.980
SOME HAVE SAID IT'S THE HAIR.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.248
REALLY? WHO SAYS THAT?

22:09.490 --> 22:10.457
OH, GUESS WHAT.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.821
WE ALREADY
RAN THE PHONE RECORDS

22:11.860 --> 22:12.952
AND CHECKED OUT
THE DRY CLEANING.

22:12.990 --> 22:14.127
PANTSUITS WERE PICKED
UP OVER A WEEK AGO.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.798
WHAT KIND OF
DOG AND PONY SHOW

22:15.830 --> 22:17.297
DO YOU THINK
WE RUN HERE?

22:17.330 --> 22:19.161
GUS, YOU WANT
TO TAKE THIS ONE?

22:19.200 --> 22:20.895
NO.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.089
LET ME PUT AN END
TO THIS NON-CASE.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.631
YES, ALL THE VICTIMS CALLED
THE 1-800 STRESS LINE,

22:24.670 --> 22:26.604
NOT JUST ONCE,
MANY TIMES OVER.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.302
DETECTIVE LASSITER AND I
HAVE COMBED EVERYTHING.

22:29.340 --> 22:30.409
WE'VE GONE TO THE BONE ON THESE.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.099
ALL THE WAY TO THE BONE?

22:32.150 --> 22:33.811
I KNOW THIS IS
HARD FOR YOU TO GRASP,

22:33.850 --> 22:35.215
BUT THESE PEOPLE DID HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.615
THEY WERE TROUBLED,

22:36.650 --> 22:37.947
AND THEY WERE
DEPRESSED,

22:37.990 --> 22:39.548
AND AS SAD AS THAT IS,

22:39.590 --> 22:40.557
THEY ALL COMMITTED SUICIDE.

22:40.590 --> 22:41.579
CASE CLOSED.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.587
WE'VE CLEARLY
WASTED YOUR TIME.

22:49.930 --> 22:50.567
IT'S NOT OVER,
IS IT?

22:50.600 --> 22:51.669
OF COURSE NOT.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.190
THEY ALL CALLED
THE SAME HELP LINE

22:53.230 --> 22:54.697
AND THEY ALL KILLED
THEMSELVES? COME ON!

22:54.740 --> 22:57.607
SHAWN, THAT'S WHAT
STRESSED PEOPLE DO.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.029
IT'S STRANGE
HOW HE GAVE UP SO EASILY.

23:00.070 --> 23:02.004
YEAH, IT IS.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.177
MAYBE WE SHOULD

23:03.210 --> 23:04.404
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT THAT STRESS LINE.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.144
GLORIA STARKS
ONLY CALLED THAT LINE

23:08.180 --> 23:09.772
BECAUSE SHE WAS STRESSED
ABOUT AN AUDITION.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.412
YOU CALL A HELP LINE,
THEY FIND YOU DEAD?

23:11.450 --> 23:13.338
THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL.

23:13.390 --> 23:14.687
WHAT IF SOMEONE THERE
IS KILLING THE CALLERS

23:14.720 --> 23:16.517
AND MAKING IT LOOK LIKE
A SUICIDE?

23:16.560 --> 23:18.187
GUS, WE GO TO
THE STRESS LINE,

23:18.230 --> 23:20.892
I THINK
WE SOLVE THE CASE.

23:20.930 --> 23:22.227
COME ON.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.063
TA- DAH !

23:30.100 --> 23:31.806
WHAT IS THIS?

23:31.840 --> 23:32.761
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
OUR NEW BUSINESS.

23:32.810 --> 23:33.777
MAZEL TOV.

23:33.810 --> 23:34.970
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.478
YOU RENTED OFFICE SPACE
FOR THIS?

23:37.510 --> 23:38.602
GUS, DON'T BE A CRAZY HOOLIGAN.

23:38.650 --> 23:40.072
I RENTED A SIGN.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.654
NOW, LET'S GO SAY HELLO
TO OUR NEW NEIGHBORS.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.698
HELLO, EVERYONE!

23:56.730 --> 23:58.095
WHO WANTS PINEAPPLE?

23:58.130 --> 23:59.165
BE HONEST.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.868
YOU GUYS CAN SLICE IT UP
AND FIGHT OVER IT LATER.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.606
I'M SORRY, GENTLEMEN.
MAY I HELP YOU?

24:04.670 --> 24:05.637
I'M TERRANCE.

24:05.670 --> 24:06.637
I RUN THE LINE HERE.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.171
TERRANCE. HELLO.

24:08.210 --> 24:09.074
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.304

24:10.340 --> 24:11.602

JACKSON.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.618

24:13.650 --> 24:16.278
WE'VE OPENED UP OUR OWN LITTLE
1-800 THINGY DOWN THE HALL.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.981
NOT AS BIG
AS YOU GUYS.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.715
MORE OF A CLOSET, REALLY.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.354
YOUR OWN 1-800...THINGY?

24:21.390 --> 24:22.652
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

24:22.690 --> 24:23.918
IT'S CALLED
"DIAL A PSYCHIC."

24:23.960 --> 24:25.689
MAYBE YOU RECOGNIZE US.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.083
I'M THE LEAD PSYCHIC

24:27.130 --> 24:28.893

POLICE DEPARTMENT.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.497

24:35.400 --> 24:36.731
THE EDMOND ROBBERIES?

24:36.770 --> 24:37.737
OVER THERE.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.533
YOU? NOTHING? NOTHING?
WOW.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.071
WHAT, DO YOU GUYS
LIVE IN THIS ROOM?

24:41.110 --> 24:43.772

24:43.810 --> 24:47.246
SO YOU CAN KNOW STUFF ABOUT ME
JUST BY LOOKING AT ME?

24:47.280 --> 24:48.508
YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.

24:48.550 --> 24:49.574

24:51.390 --> 24:52.379
SHOW US.

24:54.590 --> 24:55.614
WELL, THEY DON'T LIKE PINEAPPLE.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.650
I DON'T KNOW, GUYS.

24:59.690 --> 25:01.294
I DON'T THINK BIG T. WANTS US

25:01.330 --> 25:02.558
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.567
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.726
HALF THE LINES ARE DOWN,

25:04.770 --> 25:05.725
THE PHONES
ARE BEING WORKED ON RIGHT NOW.

25:05.770 --> 25:06.725
WE HAVE TIME
FOR YOUR LITTLE TRICK.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.431
OH YEAH?

25:12.610 --> 25:13.838
LET'S SEE
WHAT I CAN COME UP WITH.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.112
LOOSE, FLOWING STANZAS,

25:27.150 --> 25:29.948
BOBBY FROST.

25:29.990 --> 25:30.888
ARE YOU A POET, BY CHANCE?

KNOW THAT?

25:35.700 --> 25:36.655
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY

25:36.700 --> 25:38.588
I'M A BIT OF A PSYCHIC POET.

25:39.970 --> 25:40.891
OH, PLEASE. STOP.

25:43.170 --> 25:44.137
'CAUSE I'M, LIKE...

25:44.170 --> 25:45.865
I'M FREAKING OUT.

25:45.910 --> 25:47.502
DO YOU SEE HIS EYELINER?

25:47.540 --> 25:49.679
THE GUY COULD BE THE
DRUMMER FROM THE CURE.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.439
WOW.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.913
YOU CAN SEE WHY YOU
COME OUT HERE TO EAT.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.417
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

25:59.450 --> 26:01.418
THE SOUND OF THE SEAGULLS,
THE SMELL OF THE OCEAN,

26:01.460 --> 26:02.313
THE SALT AIR...

26:02.360 --> 26:04.385
HMM.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.419
I NEVER NOTICED.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.348
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

26:07.390 --> 26:08.721
IT'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.227
I RAN THE SHEETS

26:10.260 --> 26:11.989
ON ALL THE VOLUNTEERS
AT THE STRESS LINE.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.839
DO YOU MIND?

26:13.870 --> 26:15.030
IT'S POLICE BUSINESS.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.000
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.975
WELL, LOOKEE THERE.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.807
IT'S A PICTURE
OF AN OLD FRIEND.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.044
HMM.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.811
HEY, RORY.

26:42.830 --> 26:44.127
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

26:44.170 --> 26:45.797
I'VE BEEN SITTING
ON THIS MOP BUCKET

26:45.830 --> 26:47.798
IN THIS TINY CLOSET
FOR THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.398
I'M ALL CRAMPED.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.839
WELL, GET UP, MAN.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.098
DO SOME PUSHUPS OR SOMETHING.
I NEED YOU LIGHT AND LIMBER.

26:52.140 --> 26:53.129
DO SOME PUSHUPS?

26:53.170 --> 26:54.603
SURE,

26:54.640 --> 26:56.130
LIKE CLINT EASTWOOD
IN ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.909
SURE, HE SPENDS THE WHOLE MOVIE
IN THE TINY LITTLE CELL, RIGHT,

26:57.950 --> 27:01.818
BUT HE'S IN THE BEST SHAPE
OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

27:01.850 --> 27:03.681
GIVE ME A LITTLE PIECE OF TAPE.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.483
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE BIG TICKING TIME CLOCK?

27:05.520 --> 27:08.080
GUS, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'VE BEEN DOING ALL DAY?

27:13.030 --> 27:15.498
MY WORK HAPPENS HERE...

27:15.530 --> 27:16.599
AND HERE.

27:16.630 --> 27:17.892
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:17.930 --> 27:22.230
I AM TRYING TO CREATE
A PLEASANT WORK ENVIRONMENT,

27:22.270 --> 27:23.931
AND I CAN TELL BY LOOKING
AT YOUR LITTLE AREA

27:23.970 --> 27:25.267
THAT YOU DON'T CARE.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.937
WE DON'T WORK HERE, SHAWN.

27:26.970 --> 27:28.335
WE DO UNTIL WE SOLVE
THESE MURDERS,

27:28.380 --> 27:30.029
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE A PLAN.

27:30.080 --> 27:30.876
YOU ARE GOING TO CALL
THE STRESS LINE

27:30.910 --> 27:32.798
AND PRETEND
TO BE DEPRESSED,

27:35.250 --> 27:36.478
ASK FOR RORY

27:36.520 --> 27:37.544
SO THAT I CAN SEE HIM
IN ACTION.

27:37.580 --> 27:38.945
WHY DON'T YOU CALL HIM?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.389
GUS, PLEASE BE SERIOUS
FOR ONE SECOND.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.614
NO ONE'S GOING TO BELIEVE
THAT I'M DEPRESSED.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.752
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

27:42.790 --> 27:43.882
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE CAT
MAKE THE CALL?

27:43.930 --> 27:45.420
HE'S LIKE YOUR NEW PARTNER,
RIGHT?

27:45.460 --> 27:46.529
WHERE IS HE, ANYWAY?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.824
GUS, HE'S FAR MORE COMFORTABLE
IN YOUR CAR,

27:48.860 --> 27:50.964
PLUS I NEED HIM
WELL RESTED

27:51.000 --> 27:53.127
FOR WHEN HE IDENTIFIES
THE KILLER.

27:53.170 --> 27:57.095
NOW, WAIT EXACTLY TWO SECONDS,
AND THEN MAKE THE CALL.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.732
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'D EVEN SAY.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.874
HERE'S A GOOD OPENER.

28:00.910 --> 28:02.571
HELLO, MY NAME'S GUS.

28:02.610 --> 28:05.545
I HAVE A DEEP-SEATED JEALOUSY
FOR A TINY LITTLE BOY CAT.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.842
WHY WOULD YOU PUT THEM
ON SPEAKER PHONE?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.517
SEE, BECAUSE I THINK
THAT TEN DS TO UNDERCUT--

28:12.550 --> 28:14.086
BIG T!

28:14.120 --> 28:15.917
LOOK SHARP.

28:18.430 --> 28:19.783
WHAT IS IT NOW, MR. SPENCER?

28:19.830 --> 28:21.149
JUST WANTED TO
PICK YOUR BRAIN.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.156
HOW MANY LINES
DO YOU GOT GOING HERE?

28:23.200 --> 28:25.020
WELL, I HAVE 12 LINES,

28:25.070 --> 28:26.094
BUT I'M ADDING MORE
ALL THE TIME.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.290
I GET IT. I GET IT.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.638
THE MORE LINES, THE MORE GREEN,
AM I RIGHT?

28:28.670 --> 28:31.138
I'M A NON-PROFIT OPERATION.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.865
THE CALLS ARE FREE.

28:32.910 --> 28:34.798
I'M NOT IN THIS FOR THE MONEY.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.102
REALLY? THAT'S WEIRD.

28:36.140 --> 28:37.971
SEE, I'M THINKING OF CHARGING
FOUR BUCKS A MINUTE.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.719

MUSIC INSPIRES ME.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.668
YEAH, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T REALLY
STRIKE ME AS THE...

28:58.700 --> 29:00.930
CHARITABLE TYPE.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.938
I WAS GOING TO SAY "SENSITIVE,"
BUT SURE.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.437
ACTUALLY, I'M HERE
AS PART OF A COMMUNITY SERVICE

29:04.470 --> 29:05.698
ON THIS ASSAULT BEEF.

29:05.740 --> 29:08.334
I GOT INTO IT

29:08.380 --> 29:11.702

[SIGH]

29:26.830 --> 29:29.196
HELLO, STRESS LINE.

29:29.230 --> 29:30.891
THE EXTRA "S"

29:30.930 --> 29:32.420
THIS IS RORY.

29:32.470 --> 29:35.166
UH-HUH.

29:35.200 --> 29:40.399
SO YOU'RE EXPERIENCING
SOME STRESS.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.634
CAREER AND PERSONAL?

29:41.680 --> 29:45.002
WELL, YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.372
I MEAN, MY CAREER'S NOT EXACTLY
WHERE I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.947
NO. NO, I DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND RIGHT NOW.

29:51.990 --> 29:52.945
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.208
RIGHT.

29:57.990 --> 29:58.922
RIGHT.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.848
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

30:00.900 --> 30:05.291
UM, DOES IT MAKE YOU
HAVE DARK THOUGHTS?

30:05.330 --> 30:09.096
LIKE HOW DARK ARE YOU TALKING?

30:09.140 --> 30:09.936
LIKE "WANNA BE DEAD" DARK?

30:09.970 --> 30:11.437
OKAY, EASY.

30:11.470 --> 30:15.031
NOW, I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS,
LIKE, RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.502
SUICIDE IS NOT
THE ANSWER.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.599
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SUICIDE?

30:18.650 --> 30:19.969
I JUST SAID MAYBE I SHOULD FIND
A NEW HOBBY,

30:20.010 --> 30:21.341
LIKE COIN COLLECTING,

30:21.380 --> 30:22.870
OR SOMETHING AT THE BEACH.

30:22.920 --> 30:23.909
I LIKE WATER ACTIVITIES.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.315
LIKE DROWNING?

30:25.350 --> 30:26.942

30:26.990 --> 30:28.014
DROWNING?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.254
I DON'T WANT TO DROWN!

30:29.290 --> 30:31.019
NO, NO, OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.687
THAT'S AWFUL, OKAY?

30:32.730 --> 30:34.425
BUT I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY

30:34.460 --> 30:38.169

30:39.730 --> 30:43.689

AND YOUR FINAL BREATHS
RIPPLING OUT

30:45.970 --> 30:47.608
IN AN EVER-WIDENING
CIRCLE,

30:47.640 --> 30:49.073
YOU KNOW, LIKE
THE CIRCLE OF LIFE,

30:49.110 --> 30:52.443
BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP
THAT KIND OF THINKING.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.708
YOU HAVE SO MUCH
TO LIVE FOR.

30:53.750 --> 30:54.944
YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.947
I HAVE A LOT TO LIVE FOR.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.194
WAS HE TRYING TO HELP ME?
I FEEL REALLY CREEPED OUT.

31:09.230 --> 31:10.788
DUDE, HE PUT YOU
ON THE CREEPY TRAIN

31:10.830 --> 31:11.728
HEADED FOR CREEP ISLAND

31:11.770 --> 31:13.260
WHERE THE NATIVES
DRINK CREEP NECTAR

31:13.300 --> 31:14.232
OUT OF CREEPY
COCONUT SHELLS.

31:14.270 --> 31:15.999

31:19.370 --> 31:20.564
HE ACTUALLY MADE
SOME GOOD POINTS.

31:20.610 --> 31:22.931
PHARMACEUTICAL
SALES? NOT SEXY.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.607
YOU ARE MY ONLY
NON-WORK FRIEND.

31:24.650 --> 31:25.571
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

31:25.610 --> 31:27.248
HEY, HEY, HEY, WHAT IS THIS?

31:27.280 --> 31:28.144

31:28.180 --> 31:30.740
"HANG IN TH ERE."

31:30.780 --> 31:32.441
HE'S RIGHT.

31:32.490 --> 31:33.912
I NEED TO START TAKING
SOME MORE RISKS.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.951
DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN
GO CLIFF-DIVING?

31:35.990 --> 31:37.412
NO. I'M BEING SERIOUS, SHAWN.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.586
LOOK, WOULD IT MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER

31:38.630 --> 31:39.722

HILTONBOCK CALLED?

31:39.760 --> 31:41.091
WE GOT THE APARTMENT!

31:41.130 --> 31:43.121
WHAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
IS IF WE CALLED THE POLICE!

31:43.160 --> 31:44.559
THIS GUY IS
DANGEROUS, SHAWN.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.589
LET'S CALL VICK.

31:45.630 --> 31:46.460
MAYBE GET HIM ARRESTED.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.728
GUS, GUS...
WHAT?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.399
THE ONLY THING
THIS GUY IS GUILTY OF RIGHT NOW

31:50.440 --> 31:51.407
IS BEING A BAD POET.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.534
YOU KNOW HOW THIS GAME WORKS.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.104
WE CANNOT JUST PICK UP THE PHONE

31:56.140 --> 31:59.007
AND BEG THE POLICE

31:59.050 --> 32:02.349
LOOK, JUST...JUST STAY AWAY

32:02.380 --> 32:04.018
FINAL DECISION.

WE WAIT.

32:14.860 --> 32:16.851
UM, NO, IT'S THIS WAY.

32:16.900 --> 32:17.889
YOU SURE?

32:17.930 --> 32:20.490
NOW, WAS THAT SO HARD?

32:25.440 --> 32:27.931
MAYBE YOU'D CARE
TO EXPLAIN THIS.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.905
MY EYELINER PENCIL?

32:30.940 --> 32:32.305
SO YOU ADMIT IT'S YOURS.

IN BLACK EYELIN ER,

32:39.820 --> 32:41.583
YET NO EYELINER WAS FOUND
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.588
YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE LOOKING
AT EXHIBIT "A."

32:43.620 --> 32:47.226

32:49.630 --> 32:51.268
YEAH, I DO.

32:51.300 --> 32:52.267
IT'S MY INSPIRATION.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.995
I BET.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.334
I BET IT INSPIRES YOU TO KILL.

32:57.370 --> 32:59.463
THAT'S WHY
YOU COULDN'T RESIST

32:59.510 --> 33:00.829
PLAYING YOUR BIG-HAIRED,
DRUG-INDUCED DEATH MUSIC

33:00.870 --> 33:02.178
ON MORTIMER TILDEN'S STEREO

33:02.210 --> 33:04.075
WHILE YOU FORCED HIM
TO SWALLOW ALL THOSE PILLS,

33:04.110 --> 33:05.543
OR ON GLORIA STARKS' CAR RADIO

33:05.580 --> 33:07.502
WHILE SHE SLIPPED
INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS,

33:07.550 --> 33:10.269
AND EVEN NOW.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.538
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LISTEN,

YOUR HEAD-THRASHING CRAP

33:25.330 --> 33:26.297
FOR THIS NOISE?

33:26.330 --> 33:31.563
THIS CRAP
IS ALL I LISTEN TO.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.703
I HATE METAL MUSIC.

33:33.740 --> 33:36.709
I USE THE DETAILS
THAT I GET FROM CALLERS

33:36.740 --> 33:38.344
TO WRITE
BETTER POEMS.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.268
I'M NOT A KILLER.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.538
NO, YOU'RE A POET...

33:41.580 --> 33:44.515
BUT YOU'RE ALSO AN ASSAULTER,
AREN'T YOU?

33:44.550 --> 33:46.814
WHO DO YOU THINK ARRESTED YOU
ON THAT ASSAULT CHARGE?

33:57.060 --> 33:58.925
OH, A GUY FROM THE PHONE COMPANY

34:05.270 --> 34:07.602
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.201

34:15.380 --> 34:16.347
WHAT?

34:16.380 --> 34:18.018
YOU'RE NOT TAKING NOTES?

34:21.790 --> 34:23.485
HOW COULD YOU LET
HIM DO THAT?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.782
NOW LASSITER GETS CREDIT
FOR SOLVING A CRIME,

34:24.830 --> 34:26.183
AND WE DON'T
GET PAID.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.288
OH, WE'RE GONNA GET PAID.

34:27.330 --> 34:28.592
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

34:28.630 --> 34:30.052
LASSITER DIDN'T SOLVE THE CRIME.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.124
RORY'S INNOCENT.
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.228
HE DIDN'T?

34:32.270 --> 34:32.929
NO.

34:32.970 --> 34:34.733
THEN WHO DID?

34:36.270 --> 34:38.465
JUST GRIP THE SPIKE
WITH YOUR LITTLE FOOT

34:38.510 --> 34:40.899
AND CLIMB! COME ON!

34:43.780 --> 34:44.701
WHY DO I GOT TO GO UP FIRST?

34:44.750 --> 34:45.842
'CAUSE YOU'RE A
CLIMBING MACHINE, GUS.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.939
JUST, YOU KNOW, BE CAREFUL.

34:47.980 --> 34:50.175
GRIP THE SPIKE
WITH YOUR FOOT!

34:50.220 --> 34:51.949
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

34:58.930 --> 34:59.919
GREASE.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.922
DUDE! DUDE! DUDE!
I KNOW WHO THE KILLER IS.

35:06.970 --> 35:08.289
CAN I COME DOWN, THEN?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.160
NO, NO, I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE HE'S HEADED.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.701
WHO IS HE?

35:11.740 --> 35:12.832
WELL, PUT IT THIS WAY.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.428
TAKING THE APARTMENT
ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA,

35:14.480 --> 35:15.799
UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S COOL

35:15.840 --> 35:17.137
THAT OUR WOULD-BE LANDLORD
IS A SERIAL KILLER.

35:17.180 --> 35:19.546
HILTONBOCK?

35:19.580 --> 35:20.649
THERE WAS A PATTERN.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.841
SEE, ALL THE MURDERS
COINCIDE WITH DATES

35:22.880 --> 35:25.110
THAT HILTONBOCK
WAS SERVICING THE PHONE LINES.

35:25.150 --> 35:25.912
THAT'S WHEN HE HAD
ACCESS.

35:25.950 --> 35:26.985
WITH THIS?

35:27.020 --> 35:28.157
YES. YEAH, YEAH,
SEND THAT DOWN.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.688
PERFECT!

35:33.730 --> 35:35.698
SEE, THIS DEVICE STORES

35:35.730 --> 35:37.152
ALL THE INCOMING
AND OUTGOING CALLS.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.259
MY GUESS IS WHATEVER
NUMBER HE DIALED LAST,

35:39.300 --> 35:40.824
THAT'S WHERE HILTONBOCK
IS HEADED,

35:40.870 --> 35:43.430
AND WHOEVER THAT IS
IS PROBABLY HIS NEXT VICTIM.

35:43.470 --> 35:44.903
[RINGING]

35:44.940 --> 35:46.498
HELLO, YOU'VE REACHED
BUZZ MCNAB.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.428
I'M NOT IN RIGHT NOW,
BUT PLEASE DO LEAVE A MESSAGE,

35:48.480 --> 35:50.129
AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU
WHEN I GET IN.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.771
OH, NO.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.173
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

36:00.890 --> 36:02.209
HELLO, CHIEF?

36:02.260 --> 36:03.682
HEY, UH, SHAWN SPENCER HERE.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.985
LOOK, I'M GETTING A VIBE
RIGHT NOW AS BIG AS A BUICK.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.167
STAY, BOY CAT!

36:37.720 --> 36:39.153
HEY, MCNAB.

36:39.190 --> 36:40.726
SO THIS IS THE PLACE, HUH?

36:42.430 --> 36:43.249
IT'S NICE. IT'S REALLY NICE.

36:43.960 --> 36:44.767
DROP IT!

36:44.800 --> 36:45.494
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!

36:45.530 --> 36:46.497
I WILL DROP YOU!

36:46.530 --> 36:47.997
I SWEAR TO GOD
I'M GOING TO SHOOT HIM!

36:48.030 --> 36:49.031
DROP IT!

36:49.070 --> 36:50.367
EVERYBODY, BREATHE.
JUST BREATHE.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.401
GET OUT OF HERE.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.839
WOW, THE OTHER ONES
MUST HAVE GONE

36:52.870 --> 36:54.098
A LOT SMOOTHER THAN
THIS, HUH, HILTONBOCK?

36:54.140 --> 36:55.869
YEAH, COM PARATIVELY,

36:55.910 --> 36:57.172
IT WAS PROBABLY
PRETTY EASY

36:57.210 --> 36:59.804
TO GET MORTIMER TILDEN
TO SWALLOW THOSE PILLS.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.374
YOU WANT TO DIE,
OLD MAN, HUH?

37:01.420 --> 37:02.842
EAT 'EM.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.316
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT REALLY
A COLD-BLOODED SERIAL KILLER,

37:06.350 --> 37:07.578
ARE YOU?

37:07.620 --> 37:09.087
HE ONLY THREW HIS OWN BROTHER
OFF A BUILDING.

37:09.120 --> 37:09.779
I DIDN'T PUSH HIM
OFF THE ROOF.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.014
NO, NO, NO, NO.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.186
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

37:13.930 --> 37:15.659
BUT YOU WERE THERE.
YOU SAW IT.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.621
YOU SAW THE WHOLE THING.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.025
YOU SAW HIM JUMP OFF THE BALCONY

37:18.060 --> 37:19.322
OF THE APARTMENT
THAT YOU SHARED.

37:19.370 --> 37:20.792
HE WAS WEAK.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.491
THERE'S A LOT OF WEAK PEOPLE
OUT THERE, HILTONBOCK.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.996
YOU GOING TO TRACK
THEM ALL DOWN, HUH?

37:24.040 --> 37:25.405
ONE AT A TIME?

37:25.440 --> 37:27.067
PUNISH THEM FOR THEIR WEAKNESS?

37:27.110 --> 37:28.998
YOU WANT TO GET BACK
AT YOUR BROTHER SO BADLY,

37:29.040 --> 37:30.177
YOU DON'T EVEN...

37:30.210 --> 37:31.643
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE
WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE,

37:31.680 --> 37:32.669
JUST THAT THEY CALLED A LINE.

37:32.710 --> 37:33.745
LOOK, YOU WERE GOING
TO KILL MCNAB HERE

37:33.780 --> 37:34.917
JUST BECAUSE HE HAD

37:34.950 --> 37:36.975
A FEW PRE-WEDDING JITTERS.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.318
I WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR A LITTLE ADVICE.

37:39.350 --> 37:40.282
NOBODY ELSE WOULD TALK TO ME.

37:43.590 --> 37:44.989
IT'S OKAY, BUZZ.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.657
WE ALL HAVE STRESS.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.089
ALL OF US.

37:48.130 --> 37:49.392
RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM.

37:49.430 --> 37:50.419
I MEAN, TAKE A GOOD LOOK,
HILTONBOCK.

37:50.460 --> 37:51.620
WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.298
WHO ELSE DESERVES
TO GET SHOT OR HUNG?

37:54.340 --> 37:56.661
MAYBE IT'S GUS.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.600
THAT'S ENOUGH,
SPENCER.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.607
OH, SHOOT HIM.

37:59.640 --> 38:00.629
WHAT ATE YOU DOING?

38:00.670 --> 38:02.001
YEAH, MAYBE I SHOULD.

38:02.780 --> 38:03.474
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!

38:03.510 --> 38:04.977
HE'S A CRAZY PERSON.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.170
HE'S CRAZY.

38:06.210 --> 38:07.905
THAT'S RIGHT. I AM CRAZY.

38:09.150 --> 38:10.674
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHOOT ME.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.789
OKAY.

38:11.820 --> 38:15.119
HERE'S THE BEST PART.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.718
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK,

38:16.760 --> 38:18.625
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
THAT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN ME...

38:20.530 --> 38:21.519
THIS GUY.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.057
THE MAN WITH HIS GUN
TRAINED ON YOU

38:24.100 --> 38:27.991
IS NOT ONLY A FINE HUMAN BEING
WITH A STRONG IRISH HAIRLINE,

38:28.030 --> 38:30.169
HE IS AN EXEMPLARY
PUBLIC SERVANT,

38:30.200 --> 38:32.839
AND ARGUABLY
THE FINEST DETECTIVE MIND

38:32.870 --> 38:36.499
IN THE LOWER WESTERN
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AREA...

38:37.880 --> 38:40.007
OVER THE AGE OF 35,

38:40.050 --> 38:42.177
AND RIGHT NOW,
WHILE I'M SPEAKING,

38:42.220 --> 38:44.643
HE IS DEVISING A SWIFT
AND STEALTH-LIKE TACTIC

38:44.690 --> 38:47.284
THAT IS GOING TO DISARM YOU...

38:47.320 --> 38:50.289
AND BLOW YOUR FREAKING MIND.

38:58.030 --> 38:59.520
ANY TIME YOU'RE READY.

39:01.670 --> 39:03.194
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT
TO MAKE THE MOVE.

39:03.870 --> 39:04.768
OW!

39:07.170 --> 39:08.102
OW! OW!

39:11.450 --> 39:12.474
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

39:19.650 --> 39:20.878
THAT WAS ADEQUATE, SPENCER.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.979
DON'T THANK ME.

39:23.020 --> 39:24.681
THANK THE LITTLE BOY CAT.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.619
OW! OW!

39:31.670 --> 39:34.468
THERE YOU ARE!

39:34.500 --> 39:37.037
THERE'S MY BIG GUY.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.368
THERE'S MY BIG GUY.
YOU'RE A HERO!

39:39.410 --> 39:40.729
YOU'RE A HERO TODAY.

39:40.770 --> 39:42.306
YES.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.739
SPEAKING OF HEROES,

39:43.780 --> 39:46.578
MCNAB, I WAS GOING
TO GET YOU SOMETHING

39:46.610 --> 39:47.645
OFF THE REGISTRY ONLINE,

39:47.680 --> 39:48.977
BUT IT TURNS OUT THE CHIEF

39:49.020 --> 39:50.009
ALREADY GOT YOU

39:50.050 --> 39:52.518
THE ASPARAGUS
STEAM ER, SO...

39:52.550 --> 39:55.986
INSTEAD, I GIVE YOU
THIS LITTLE GUY.

39:57.290 --> 39:58.655
YEAH.

40:03.660 --> 40:07.562
IF YOU TAKE HIM IN THE CAR,
HE LIKES TO RIDE UP FRONT.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.589
SHOTGUN.

40:16.910 --> 40:19.276
[GUS]: YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL

40:19.310 --> 40:21.619
ABOUT THE COLOR
FRUITY PUFFS TURNS THE MILK.

40:21.650 --> 40:24.244
I THINK IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.838
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

40:25.890 --> 40:26.845
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

40:26.890 --> 40:27.879
WHO HAS A CHARMED LIFE,
SHAWN.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.683
I'VE GOT IT
PRETTY GOOD TOO.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.687
YES, YOU DO,

40:30.720 --> 40:31.948
AND IT MAKES ME GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY SO.

40:31.990 --> 40:34.356
I MEAN, THE OTHER DAY
AT WORK,

40:34.390 --> 40:36.199
THIS DERMATOLOGIST,
KATIE FINESTATT,

40:36.230 --> 40:38.460
COMMENTED HOW I LOOKED HANDSOME

40:38.500 --> 40:40.593
CARRYING MY SAMPLE CASE
INTO HER OFFICE.

40:40.630 --> 40:41.369
FINESTATT SAID THAT?

40:41.400 --> 40:42.492
YES, SHE DID.

40:42.540 --> 40:43.837
AND SHE IS FINE.

40:43.870 --> 40:47.704
SO IT GOT ME THINKING,

40:47.740 --> 40:51.198
MAYBE PHARMACEUTICAL SALES
CAN BE SORT OF SEXY.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.878
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I HAVE
TO STAND A FEW FEET AWAY

40:52.910 --> 40:54.241
BECAUSE YOU'RE LITERALLY
SIZZLING.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.440
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

40:55.480 --> 40:58.483
I MEAN, YOU MAY BE MY
ONLY NON-WORK FRIEND.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.408
BUT YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,

41:00.450 --> 41:03.613
AND HOW MANY BEST FRIENDS
DOES ONE GUY NEED, REALLY?

41:03.660 --> 41:05.025
THAT'S MY POINT.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.288
IT'S ALL IN THE ATTITUDE,
GUS.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.992
EXACTLY. NOT SWEATING
THE SMALL STUFF.

41:09.030 --> 41:12.921
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.
TOO SHORT.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.837
CHANGING MY ATTITUDE, SHAWN.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.609
WHERE THE HELL IS MY PRIZE?
WHERE'S MY RING, SHAWN?

41:26.650 --> 41:28.049
EASY, NOW.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.570
NO, NO. I TIMED THE BOWLS
OUT PERFECT LY, SHAWN.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.110
ME, THEN YOU, THEN ME,
THEN YOU,

41:31.150 --> 41:32.686
THEN I GET THE PRIZE.

41:32.720 --> 41:35.951
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO NOT
SWEATING THE SMALL STUFF?

41:35.990 --> 41:37.309
LIFE'S TOO SHORT?
ALL THAT?

41:37.360 --> 41:40.249
DID YOU OPEN THE BOTTOM
OF THE BOX?

41:40.290 --> 41:42.622
WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

41:42.660 --> 41:44.696
THAT'S MY RING.

41:44.730 --> 41:46.095
HMM?

41:46.130 --> 41:47.961
YOU KNOW I WOULD KILL
FOR THAT RING, DON'T YOU?

41:48.000 --> 41:48.932
UH, YOU'RE UPSETTING ME.

41:48.970 --> 41:50.130
YOU JUST CHANGED MY MOOD

41:50.170 --> 41:51.967
FROM AN ORANGEY YELLOW
TO A MUDDY BROWN.

41:52.010 --> 41:55.468
YOU NEED TO SAY
SOMETHING SWEET, QUICK.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.377
GUS...

41:59.410 --> 42:05.212
THAT'S SO CHILDISH AND...

42:07.290 --> 42:08.951
I'M GOING TO EAT YOURS.
