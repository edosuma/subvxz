01:00.270 --> 01:08.069
(Episode 4: Confession)

01:09.989 --> 01:11.739
What are you doing?

01:13.909 --> 01:15.409
At least tell me the reason.

01:16.329 --> 01:18.459
What did I do?

01:22.420 --> 01:23.459
I bet it was you.

01:23.799 --> 01:25.549
You piece of trash.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.139
Kim Hyun Soo!

01:37.140 --> 01:38.518
(You're doomed!)

01:38.519 --> 01:42.900
As soon as I get out of here, I will kill you at all costs.

01:43.650 --> 01:45.689
You little scumbag.

01:47.030 --> 01:48.819
Kim Hyun Soo!

01:50.569 --> 01:52.780
You darned louse!

02:08.680 --> 02:10.259
A polygraph?

02:12.050 --> 02:14.389
Even if we request one right away,

02:14.639 --> 02:16.889
we'll have to wait at least two weeks to get it done.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.599
I can take care of that.

02:19.439 --> 02:22.270
What do you say? I don't think anything bad will come out of it.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.568
If Kim Hyun Soo refuses to take it,

02:24.569 --> 02:27.149
it'll help us prove him guilty at the trial.

02:27.150 --> 02:29.399
Even if the results say he's not lying,

02:29.400 --> 02:31.240
it's not admissible as evidence.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.990
If it says he's lying, it'll totally help us out.

02:36.449 --> 02:37.659
That's true.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.460
But I'm sure you didn't call me here to explain this.

02:41.710 --> 02:42.750
What's going on?

02:43.379 --> 02:44.379
Chief Park.

02:45.879 --> 02:48.090
You're sure that Kim Hyun Soo...

02:48.879 --> 02:50.218
is the killer, right?

02:50.219 --> 02:51.840
I only trust the evidence.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.550
Then help me.

02:55.219 --> 02:56.259
I need him...

02:57.310 --> 02:59.389

(Shin Joong Han Law Firm)

03:10.449 --> 03:14.240
The Chrysanthemum case is causing quite a stir online.

03:14.370 --> 03:16.698
Our reporter who is in front of the residence...

03:16.699 --> 03:20.000
of Kim Hyun Soo, the accused, will tell us more.

03:20.539 --> 03:21.539
Reporter Kim.

03:22.580 --> 03:23.629
Yes. At the moment,

03:24.460 --> 03:27.668
many women's organizations and civilians are gathered here...

03:27.669 --> 03:29.549
to protest.

03:29.550 --> 03:31.049
In order to maintain order, the police...

03:31.050 --> 03:33.388
Yes, we accept credit cards. No interest for three months.

03:53.490 --> 03:56.620

04:36.160 --> 04:37.870
You look weary.

(Sunwoo Hospital)

05:08.860 --> 05:10.319
That way. Over there.

05:20.579 --> 05:23.790
I gave her spending money, so she should do as I say.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.579
I lost my temper and hit her a couple of times.

05:26.829 --> 05:30.169
Then this crazy witch lost her mind and lashed out at me.

05:30.170 --> 05:31.629
So I gave her more beatings.

05:31.879 --> 05:34.920
I'd had a drink or two, so I was a little drunk.

05:36.089 --> 05:38.509
After a little while, I started to get a kick out of it.

05:39.470 --> 05:42.600
I used to be an athlete.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.269
Darn it. I had everything going for me back then.

05:46.310 --> 05:47.439
That stings!

05:49.519 --> 05:51.189
I'll need two weeks to recover, right?

05:55.819 --> 05:57.899
(Hong Guk Hwa at the Scene)

06:17.470 --> 06:19.720
You do not admit to killing Hong Guk Hwa, right?

06:23.139 --> 06:25.850
I didn't kill her.

06:28.850 --> 06:30.560
There's plenty of evidence,

06:31.480 --> 06:32.899
but you say you don't remember a thing.

06:33.439 --> 06:35.730
This must be awfully frustrating for you.

06:40.490 --> 06:43.029
If you're indicted now, there is no hope for you.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.410
You'll be charged with rape, special assault, and murder.

06:46.910 --> 06:49.410
Such a brutal murder, but you show no remorse.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.170
I guarantee you.

06:53.339 --> 06:55.300
It'll be very hard for you to escape a life sentence.

06:56.379 --> 06:57.920
You could be sentenced to death.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.008
Three years for a rape charge.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.559
Five years for special assault.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.480
Additional five years for assault causing bodily harm...

07:09.810 --> 07:11.310
and the fact that she's a minor.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.689
Then we're talking at least 13 years.

07:14.689 --> 07:15.939
Let's see.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.198
Three thousand dollars for the warrant review...

07:20.199 --> 07:21.778
and the habeas corpus proceedings.

07:21.779 --> 07:23.659
A half-year for the 1st trial, so that's 30,000 dollars.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.828
But you'll be convicted without a doubt,

07:25.829 --> 07:27.829
and the appeal proceedings will cost 50,000 dollars.

07:28.290 --> 07:31.369
You're showing no remorse whatsoever, so this will end up...

07:31.370 --> 07:32.708
in the Supreme Court.

07:32.709 --> 07:33.999
Then I'll have to add another 100,000 dollars.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.588
And another 50,000 dollars to compensate the victim...

07:36.589 --> 07:38.049
and settle the case...

07:38.050 --> 07:41.419
How much is this? Round it up. Let's count the zeroes.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.850
It comes to 183,000 dollars, plus tax.

07:48.180 --> 07:50.179
Let's make it 200,000 dollars, to keep it simple.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.639
- What? 200,000? - Yes, exactly 200,000 dollars.

07:53.060 --> 07:56.269
What if I sue her for this injury that will take two weeks to heal?

07:56.689 --> 07:57.819
(Are you having legal issues?)

07:58.230 --> 08:00.109
On my business card... No, the other side.

08:00.110 --> 08:02.740
Yes. See the bank account number?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.449
Send 50 percent as a retainer fee...

08:05.319 --> 08:08.329
Send a lump-sum payment and give me a call.

08:08.449 --> 08:12.079
(Number 1 Rated ICU, Sunwoo Hospital)

08:14.209 --> 08:16.670
I don't see any trash cans here.

08:17.670 --> 08:21.009
Trash should be thrown into a trash can.

08:23.759 --> 08:25.970
Is there a trash can here?

08:26.180 --> 08:28.139
Where? Is there no trash can here?

08:30.389 --> 08:32.389
So? Are you going to take it on?

08:33.100 --> 08:36.898
Hey, what do you take me for? Filter out these jerks, will you?

08:36.899 --> 08:38.860
Must you waste my time first thing in the morning?

08:39.070 --> 08:42.779
My goodness. Since when were you so picky?

08:43.320 --> 08:44.700
I am picky.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.080
There is a way.

08:51.789 --> 08:54.960
What do you say? A polygraph test.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.999
You're claiming that you don't remember anything,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.629
but we find it hard to believe.

09:02.919 --> 09:06.509
And it seems like you need something to back up your claim with.

09:06.639 --> 09:08.299
You'll have a hard time in jail.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.059
Rapists and murderers are treated the worst.

09:14.519 --> 09:17.350
Polygraph evidence is not admissible in court.

09:18.649 --> 09:21.480
But if it shows that what you're claiming is true,

09:22.440 --> 09:24.610
you can use it to change public opinion.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.529
Then you'll have an easier time in jail,

09:29.659 --> 09:31.409
and it'll make your parents happy.

09:33.539 --> 09:35.039
Think about it.

09:36.830 --> 09:38.919
In your situation right now,

09:39.960 --> 09:43.049
it is the only way to prove your innocence.

09:48.389 --> 09:51.559
We'll give you some time. Consult your attorney and...

09:51.759 --> 09:52.809
I'll do it.

09:57.809 --> 09:59.230
I'll take a polygraph test.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.029
Hey, what's up?

10:11.159 --> 10:13.409
Hyun Soo will take a polygraph test today.

10:17.330 --> 10:20.419
Hey, you called the wrong person.

10:22.379 --> 10:23.710

You know her too. Park Mi Kyung.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.470
She's his attorney now.

10:32.259 --> 10:33.350
Park Mi Kyung?

10:38.600 --> 10:41.610
Hold on. What's Hyun Soo doing...

10:42.230 --> 10:44.480
at the Prosecutors' Office without his attorney?

10:44.899 --> 10:45.980
Take it easy.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.279

11:30.240 --> 11:33.070
What do you mean? No one has contacted me regarding this.

11:33.370 --> 11:35.869
We have Mr. Kim Hyun Soo's consent.

11:35.870 --> 11:38.080
We'll proceed with PDD right away.

11:38.409 --> 11:39.580
Ms. An.

11:40.330 --> 11:43.829
I see that you had him brought in without his attorney present.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.960
I did not know that he has a new attorney now.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.378
Had you called me,

11:48.379 --> 11:49.879
we could've prevented this misunderstanding.

11:54.299 --> 11:57.470
Well, you know the drill. Have a good day.

12:05.149 --> 12:06.269
Kim Hyun Soo...

12:07.110 --> 12:09.029
He's more reckless than I thought.

12:12.610 --> 12:14.869
Go to the NFS and meet with Kim Hyun Soo.

12:14.870 --> 12:16.990
Give warning with words he can't hold you to.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.409
If he ever makes a decision like this again alone,

12:19.700 --> 12:20.909
this agreement will be over.

12:44.730 --> 12:47.559
she will be cremated without a funeral.

12:52.779 --> 12:54.360
You haven't seen her since that night, right?

13:47.669 --> 13:50.878
Isn't it about time you stopped calling me "honey"?

13:50.879 --> 13:52.628
It's been five years since the divorce.

13:52.629 --> 13:56.090
What should I call you then? Darling?

13:56.590 --> 13:59.679
Or maybe you'd prefer Doctor Hong Jung A.

14:00.639 --> 14:03.850
Just tell me why you called, Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

14:04.059 --> 14:06.558
Well, I'm actually outside the NFS.

14:06.559 --> 14:07.599

Stop it!

15:56.210 --> 15:57.919
You must know that there was an autopsy.

15:59.509 --> 16:01.629
Her head, chest, and stomach.

16:04.259 --> 16:06.679
She was opened up, and her organs were removed.

16:07.429 --> 16:09.769
Just like a stuffed doll that is hollow inside,

16:12.309 --> 16:14.190
all that's left of her is her skeleton and skin.

Hyun Soo, truth be told, I'm against this lie detector test.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.440
I wouldn't do it if it were me.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.479
I agreed to this to prove my innocence.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.690
I understand where you're coming from but...

Hyun Soo, suspects have the right to protect themselves,

18:37.829 --> 18:40.709

19:25.049 --> 19:27.798
and only six of them will be about the case.

19:27.799 --> 19:30.338
Whether the test deems you lying or not...

19:30.339 --> 19:32.338
depends on your mental state,

19:32.339 --> 19:34.719
so it's most important to stay calm.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.720
Do you understand?

19:40.230 --> 19:41.230
Yes.

19:41.690 --> 19:42.690
Okay?

Mr. Kim, we will begin the PDD test.

20:48.750 --> 20:52.470
Mr. Kim, will you answer my questions truthfully?

20:54.720 --> 20:55.720
Yes.

20:58.180 --> 21:00.349
Mr. Kim, are you a woman?

No.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.670
No, I didn't.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.890
Did you stab Hong Guk Hwa?

21:52.279 --> 21:53.779
No, I didn't.

21:55.819 --> 21:58.450
Did killing Hong Guk Hwa bring you elation?

22:02.079 --> 22:03.079
No.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.210
How could I feel that way when I didn't kill her?

22:09.839 --> 22:11.589
Please stick to yes or no.

22:13.839 --> 22:14.839
No.

22:30.650 --> 22:35.069
That night, you were drunk with a blood alcohol level of 0.12,

22:35.819 --> 22:38.529
and you may have a tendency to violence you didn't know about.

22:39.029 --> 22:41.619
So can you be sure you didn't kill her?

22:44.579 --> 22:45.579
What?

22:47.289 --> 22:48.289
Can you be sure...

22:49.210 --> 22:50.579

Yes.

42:37.099 --> 42:38.309
and all of them...

42:38.769 --> 42:41.400
point to Kim Hyun Soo as the suspect.

42:42.110 --> 42:43.989
The defence is arguing...

42:44.320 --> 42:47.489
that the suspect is no flight risk,

42:48.159 --> 42:51.159
but he recently tried to leave prison without permission.

42:52.199 --> 42:53.789
And while claiming his innocence,

42:54.449 --> 42:58.329
he also rejected the polygraph test suggested by the prosecution.

will be beneficial toward social stability.

Ms. Seo,

1:03:37.570 --> 1:03:39.239
let me join you.

1:03:40.030 --> 1:03:41.030
With what?

1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:55.719
Ms. Park is right.

1:03:56.380 --> 1:03:57.759
A sentence of ten years with model behaviour?

1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.300
Three to four years will be shed off.

1:04:00.219 --> 1:04:01.599
You'll be out at around 30...

1:04:01.849 --> 1:04:03.269
and live a new life.

1:04:03.849 --> 1:04:05.429
It's a fantastic deal.

1:04:08.690 --> 1:04:11.980
That's how any lawyer would assess this situation.

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:15.780
Gosh. The hardships...

1:04:16.949 --> 1:04:18.949
must make you want to give up.

1:04:22.409 --> 1:04:23.739
But look at this.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.210
Even atopic dermatitis haunts you all your life,

1:04:29.289 --> 1:04:30.500
so being branded as an ex-con?

1:04:33.380 --> 1:04:35.210
You'll never be free of that.

1:04:35.630 --> 1:04:36.630
Never.

1:04:44.849 --> 1:04:45.849
Then,

1:04:47.099 --> 1:04:49.389
what would you do if you were in my place?

1:04:52.559 --> 1:04:53.570
Me?

1:04:56.400 --> 1:04:57.489
Well...

1:04:59.699 --> 1:05:01.699
I'd ask myself...

1:05:04.119 --> 1:05:05.289
if I killed her.

1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:11.539
If I'm really the one who murdered Hong Guk Hwa.

1:05:24.139 --> 1:05:25.929
Before the trial begins,

1:05:26.719 --> 1:05:28.428
I see we have something to address.

1:05:28.429 --> 1:05:29.940
(Defendant)

1:05:30.139 --> 1:05:32.808
The defendant wishes to take this opportunity...

1:05:32.809 --> 1:05:35.730
to confess to the crime in exchange for a plea deal.

1:05:36.650 --> 1:05:37.780
Is this true?

1:05:42.239 --> 1:05:43.239
Yes.

1:05:44.530 --> 1:05:45.909
When making this decision,

1:05:46.369 --> 1:05:48.999
were you pressured or were procedures improperly followed?

1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.460
(Defendant)

1:05:51.579 --> 1:05:53.829
(Defence)

1:05:57.840 --> 1:05:58.840
No.

1:05:59.210 --> 1:06:00.670
Then we shall begin.

1:06:01.340 --> 1:06:02.718
The defendant will rise.

1:06:02.719 --> 1:06:04.468
Prosecution, proceed.

1:06:04.469 --> 1:06:08.598
(Court)

1:06:08.599 --> 1:06:09.599
Mr. Kim.

1:06:12.519 --> 1:06:15.230
Are you standing here today...

1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:17.518
to confess to your crime...

1:06:17.519 --> 1:06:19.899
and ask for leniency with your sentence?

1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:21.948
As his legal representative,

1:06:21.949 --> 1:06:23.860
I will answer in his place.

1:06:24.409 --> 1:06:25.409
Yes.

1:06:30.750 --> 1:06:32.408
Once you confess and plead guilty,

1:06:32.409 --> 1:06:34.209
you lose your right to cross-examination...

1:06:34.210 --> 1:06:37.339
and the summoning of witnesses on your behalf. Do you understand?

1:06:37.340 --> 1:06:39.799
Yes. I explained to him at length,

1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:41.420
and he understands.

1:06:42.170 --> 1:06:44.929
Are you also aware that you lose the right to appeal?

1:06:45.260 --> 1:06:46.260
Yes.

1:06:55.230 --> 1:06:56.440
Then tell us.

1:06:58.440 --> 1:06:59.440
What happened...

1:07:01.230 --> 1:07:02.610
that night?

1:07:10.579 --> 1:07:11.579
That night,

1:07:12.449 --> 1:07:15.749
the defendant left his house, took his father's taxi,

1:07:15.750 --> 1:07:18.170
and drove to the house his friends were at.

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.839
He is uncertain of the time and location,

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:22.799
but when he was parked after getting lost on the road,

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.379
the victim got in the car.

1:07:24.380 --> 1:07:26.799
He drove them to the Han River where they chatted.

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:30.218
After hitting it off, they went to her house to drink.

1:07:30.219 --> 1:07:32.719
They played the knife game and had sexual intercourse.

1:07:52.119 --> 1:07:53.119
Defendant?

1:07:55.039 --> 1:07:56.039
Defendant!

1:07:56.920 --> 1:07:58.000
Yes?

1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:02.919
(Court)

1:08:02.920 --> 1:08:04.969
I will ask the defendant one last time.

1:08:07.300 --> 1:08:08.300
Did you...

1:08:09.510 --> 1:08:12.429
kill Hong Guk Hwa?

1:08:21.859 --> 1:08:22.859
No.

1:08:25.439 --> 1:08:27.319
Hyun Soo, we had a deal. Come on.

1:08:33.489 --> 1:08:35.328
Your Honour, it seems as though...

1:08:35.329 --> 1:08:38.038
that the defendant didn't quite understand you.

1:08:38.039 --> 1:08:40.420
Could you please repeat your question?

1:08:46.670 --> 1:08:47.670
Defendant.

1:08:49.380 --> 1:08:53.350
Did you kill Hong Guk Hwa?

1:08:53.850 --> 1:08:55.600
(Defence)

1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:29.220
No.

1:09:31.130 --> 1:09:33.090
I didn't kill her.
