WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.803
Liz, did you hear?

00:03.803 --> 00:05.566
Yeah, is your brother going to be okay?

00:05.672 --> 00:06.832
No, not that.

00:07.207 --> 00:11.473
A new movie about Janis Joplin
is going into production.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.114
And Sheinhardt-Universal is making it!

00:14.114 --> 00:16.116
I know Jack can get me an audition.

00:16.116 --> 00:19.517
So I'm going to storm into his office in character.

00:19.586 --> 00:20.687
Yaaaaaaaay!

00:20.687 --> 00:23.383
Oh, Liz, I knew you'd be happy for me.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.481
Somebody's sleepy!

00:25.625 --> 00:29.662
I am sleepy. But I'm also excited...

00:29.662 --> 00:35.468
Hey, Max! Is this your baby sister?
What a cute, little girl!

00:35.468 --> 00:38.631
Or boy, if you grow up and
feel that's what's inside you.

00:41.274 --> 00:45.005
"O-M-G-", Liz. Look at you
and me and our biological clocks.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.803
You're going baby crazy and I
keep getting turned on by car accidents.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.184
I'm not baby crazy, Jenna.

00:51.184 --> 00:54.921
This whole adoption thing is just
taking a lot longer than I thought, and...

00:54.921 --> 00:56.389
Where did you get that little shoe?

00:56.389 --> 00:58.016
It isn't stealing if it fell on the ground.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.231
So that's the tour, Elisa.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.868
I think you'll find being my
mother's nurse is a mixed bag.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.573
When she's in a foul mood,
it can be horribly unpleasant.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.201
But, at other times, she is asleep.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.537
I understand elder care can be stressful.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.114
Especially when the object of that care

01:21.114 --> 01:24.550
wanders around at night in
Depression-era pettipants.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.317
You should have seen my
grandmother in her later years.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.690
Do you know what kind of clothes old
Puerto Rican ladies wear around the house?

01:30.690 --> 01:31.791
No.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.224
Me neither, because she never wore any.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.696
But family is family. You're a good son.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.932
Well, I do what I can for my mother.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.602
Jack?! Somebody's got to dry me off!

01:42.602 --> 01:44.866
He just left, Mrs. Donaghy!

01:45.472 --> 01:47.565
I'm coming to help you!

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:10.196 --> 02:12.732
Tracy, your friends and I
are concerned about you.

02:12.732 --> 02:14.996
We think your spending
has gotten out of control.

02:15.935 --> 02:16.959
Give me an example.

02:17.403 --> 02:20.006
Well, you bought three
hours of network prime time

02:20.006 --> 02:22.270
for your salute to Benny Hill.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.145
Jack, you don't get it.

02:32.418 --> 02:35.588
I don't want to spend so much.
I have to.

02:35.588 --> 02:36.890
I'm afraid Angie will divorce me

02:36.890 --> 02:39.791
if I ever have enough money
for her to live off of half.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.461
So, before she can get it...

02:41.461 --> 02:43.429
I have to spend it all on useless things,

02:43.429 --> 02:46.330
Iike gold shoes and Grizz and Dotcom.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.435
Well, she she's not going to
get half your money, Tracy.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.629
What does your pre-nup say?

02:50.770 --> 02:52.138
I don't got a pre-nup.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.841
When Angie and I got
married, my only assets were

02:54.841 --> 02:58.278
a toaster oven and two
tickets to a Young M.C. concert.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.279
You need to be protected.

02:59.279 --> 03:00.513
Let's bring Angie in here.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.715
We'll think of something.
A "post-nup", if you will.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.842
Something that will
bring you peace of mind.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.885
Okay.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.646
I'll bring Angie in.

03:08.288 --> 03:11.086
But I'm going to tell her this is all your idea.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.360
Don't help me! I'm too proud.

03:23.570 --> 03:26.539
Hi! Hi!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.132
Oh, wow!

03:30.977 --> 03:32.011
"Hi-ya", funny.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.000
Oh, excuse me.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.547
Hello, there.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.249
Did you just touch my head?

03:36.249 --> 03:37.817
Well...

03:37.817 --> 03:40.149
I had to do something to get your attention.

03:40.587 --> 03:41.986
Okay. You've got it.

03:42.422 --> 03:45.550
Yeah, I do. I like your tie.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.057
And I like aggressive women with a nerdy vibe.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.430
How about we grab some
coffee and explore this?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.057
Yeah.

03:53.766 --> 03:54.994
What?

03:56.402 --> 03:59.806
Howdy, Jack! It's me, Janis Joplin!

03:59.806 --> 04:05.545
And I want to audition for my
Sheinhardt-Universal biopic so bad

04:05.545 --> 04:07.447
that I came here dressed as me.

04:07.447 --> 04:11.349
Well, actually... I am me. So...

04:11.417 --> 04:15.955
Well, I dressed normal.
But my friend, Jenna Maroney...

04:15.955 --> 04:19.559
She should be my understudy.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.928
I mean, she should audition for me.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.631
But I'm me, now, actually.

04:24.631 --> 04:28.601
Ongoing train wreck aside,
I love this idea. It's great synergy.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.003
Yeah!

04:30.003 --> 04:32.405
By putting a T.V. actress in to
the movie world, we can promote both.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.674
It's like how we're including a "Heroes" D.V.D.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.876
with every missile guidance system we sell.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.878
I'll call the studio.

04:38.878 --> 04:43.645
Yes! I am so glad that I
time-traveled here from 1969.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.543
Whoa! What is that iron bird?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.121
They had airplanes in the '60s, Jenna.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.088
Oh, right.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.250
Boy, I feel like I've just been talking non-stop.

04:52.392 --> 04:53.723
No, you also ate quite a bit.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.929
It's my fault for wanting
to hear all about your job.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.865
It's just so much more interesting than the U.N.

04:58.865 --> 05:02.602
Oh, come on. Really? You've got all the
different languages and the costumes and

05:02.602 --> 05:06.572
that big meeting room. It must be like
working in the Galactic Senate in "Star Wars".

05:06.572 --> 05:07.707
They are similar.

05:07.707 --> 05:11.370
We are also very concerned about the
growing influence of the Sith Lords.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.416
Wow.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.318
Are you free for dinner some night this week?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.343
Yeah. Sure. I'd love to. Sounds great.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.250
Who was that?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.896
A guy that I met.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.295
Is this part of your mommy thing?

05:31.364 --> 05:35.401
Only insofar as we met because I
touched his head thinking he was a child?

05:35.401 --> 05:36.669
Oh, Liz.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.106
I like him. He's smart,
he's funny, he's got a job...

05:40.106 --> 05:41.140
Yay!

05:41.140 --> 05:42.141
But you know what? I'm going to screw this up.

05:42.141 --> 05:43.876
I always find a way to screw good things up.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.378
And this one is a mine field.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.380
Did I mention that we met
because I thought he was a baby?

05:47.380 --> 05:48.438
He doesn't have to know that.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.116
Oh. He can't know that.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.584
But what if I say something stupid?

05:51.584 --> 05:55.247
Like order a tall coffee or
talk about my Nintendo Wii?

05:55.455 --> 05:58.583
Liz. You like this guy. You're a grown woman.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.119
Take a lesson from Janis
and show some self-control.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.830
How far into that biography are you?

06:03.830 --> 06:05.598
Not very.

06:05.598 --> 06:06.656
Why? What happens?

06:06.799 --> 06:08.266
So, let me get this straight.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.895
If I sign this,

06:10.036 --> 06:13.494
and then Tracy decides to run away
with that chunky chick from "Hairspray"...

06:13.573 --> 06:16.743
Or any female of equivalent thickness.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.978
Then I get $8500?

06:18.978 --> 06:19.945
That is correct.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.051
What do I care?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.916
I'll sign your stupid contract.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.915
I'm never going to leave this man, anyway.

06:28.988 --> 06:30.250
You're not?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.257
Baby, I'm going to be
with you until the very end.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.891
I'm going to watch you die, Tracy Jordan.

06:37.296 --> 06:38.991
She's done it before, Jack.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.102
Forget it! I know
you're not going to leave me.

06:43.102 --> 06:45.905
I've got somebody who's
going to watch me die!

06:45.905 --> 06:47.600
Tracy, let's not get emotional.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.805
This is happening, Jack.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.848
You can stay or you can leave.
But it's going to take a while.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.076
Whoa! Oh, yeah!

06:57.683 --> 06:59.548
Oh! Oh!

07:00.887 --> 07:05.224
Uh, Liz... Jenna got the lead in the
Janis Joplin biopic that I'm co-producing.

07:05.224 --> 07:08.394
And I want her to open the next
show with a song... from the movie.

07:08.394 --> 07:09.695
Aw, come on, Jack.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.964
You can't fight synergy, Lemon.
It's bigger than all of us.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.667
Nice dress. Are you going to dinner?
Don't forget your book.

07:14.667 --> 07:18.070
I'll have you know that
I'm having dinner with a man.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.405
Oh.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.407
So, Stuart...
What is it like living under a bridge?

07:21.407 --> 07:22.942
Kenneth!

07:22.942 --> 07:26.712
Hey, Liz. I was just telling him
about my new apartment in Williamsburg.

07:26.712 --> 07:27.847
Under the bridge.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.716
The U.N.? They still have that?

07:30.716 --> 07:32.785
I could have sworn they turned
that building into a Barnes and Noble.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.288
Like you guys in corporate
America are doing any better?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.691
Have you learned how to say
"Do you want fries with that" in Chinese?

07:38.691 --> 07:41.027
Jack Donaghy.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.896
Senior V.P. for Television
and Microwave Oven Programming.

07:43.896 --> 07:47.730
Stuart LaGrange. U.N. High Commission
on Water Temperature and Food Taint.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.736
Huh. How... How did you and Lemon meet?

07:50.736 --> 07:54.307
Uh... Liz, here, just saw me
on the street and went for it.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.374
Lemon did that?

07:55.374 --> 07:57.171
Yeah, you know me.

07:57.243 --> 08:01.475
Spend my lunch hour walking up and down
Sixth Avenue... Iooking for a hot meal.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.275
Okay. Classic Lemon man-eater.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.879
Cat sound.

08:06.686 --> 08:07.687
Well, nice to meet you, Jack.

08:07.687 --> 08:08.779
Yeah.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.092
There he is! I owe you, Jackie"D".

08:13.092 --> 08:16.529
When I'm on my death bed,
Frenching my wife, I will think of you.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.597
Please don't.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.300
No, no. Not again.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.734
This is real, people! This is not a drill!

08:24.103 --> 08:25.605
Let's go! Yeah!

08:25.605 --> 08:26.606
Oh, God!

08:26.606 --> 08:27.640
Tracy! My back!

08:27.640 --> 08:29.335
Oh, baby! You're hurting my back!

08:31.010 --> 08:32.068
Oh, yeah!

08:34.881 --> 08:37.717
I just want you all to know as I
prepare to venture into "movie-dom",

08:37.717 --> 08:39.619
that an actor is only as good as the words...

08:39.619 --> 08:41.849
Oh, my thing is on! Everyone, shut up!
Shut your mouths!

08:42.188 --> 08:45.749
Breaking news now about
a new Janis Joplin biopic.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.290
Julia Roberts has agreed
to play the tragic singer...

08:48.361 --> 08:50.763
- What?
- ...Billy in a film directed by Martin Scorsese

08:50.763 --> 08:53.132
and written by the best
screenwriter in the world.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.200
Whoever that is.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.403
The announcement is a huge
blow to a competing project

08:57.403 --> 08:59.633
from Jenna Maroney and Steven Spielberger.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.907
That's right. "Spielberger".

09:02.174 --> 09:04.039
Here's Maroney on a windy day.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.538
Oh!

09:05.611 --> 09:07.313
Don't turn it off, Miss Maroney!

09:07.313 --> 09:09.372
They haven't shown that good
news you were telling us about.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.079
Because that all seemed like really bad news.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.956
It's 7:00. Why
don't I hear my mother yelling

09:16.956 --> 09:19.525
"go home" to the Asian
contestant on Jeopardy?

09:19.525 --> 09:20.660
Because she's asleep.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.794
Really?

09:21.794 --> 09:23.193
How did you do that?

09:23.262 --> 09:24.530
She fought me at first.

09:24.530 --> 09:28.091
But I find that authoritative,
rapid Spanish subdues white people.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.635
Well, I'm heading out for the evening.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.164
Oh, I forgot.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.733
Somebody dropped that off for you earlier.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.845
Oh, good God.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.676
Oh. Gold shoes.

09:41.847 --> 09:45.251
My nephew just joined the Marines
to try to pay for college, but...

09:45.251 --> 09:46.252
that's fun.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.720
No, no. They're from Tracy Jordan.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.222
I tried to get him and his
wife to sign a pre-nup.

09:50.222 --> 09:53.993
But all it led to were pledges of
ever lasting love and devotion. It was...

09:53.993 --> 09:55.027
ridiculous.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.329
What's ridiculous about love?

09:56.329 --> 09:59.865
Well, the idea of depending on one person
for the rest of your life is irrational.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.867
You come in alone. You go out alone.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.469
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.538
There's nothing sad about it at all, actually.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.505
I have a great life.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.008
Tonight, I'm going out
with a Fox News correspondent.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.876
We'll have some dinner, some laughs, some sex...

10:10.876 --> 10:12.411
Not necessarily in that order.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.981
But I'm not counting on
spending the rest of my life with her.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.883
So, what's your plan? Get old? Die alone?

10:17.883 --> 10:19.852
In an empty room with your gold shoes?

10:19.852 --> 10:21.454
That's what happens to most of us.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.022
At least I'm prepared.

10:23.022 --> 10:26.726
Without getting into specifics,
my exit involves a McFlurry machine

10:26.726 --> 10:29.128
and a videotape of risqué
commercials from overseas.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.796
Well, I don't even know what to say to that.

10:30.796 --> 10:35.597
Except that in Puerto Rico,
a McFlurry is called a "Señor Flurry".

10:38.337 --> 10:39.705
This guy makes "badhushas".

10:39.705 --> 10:41.764
They're like an Indian doughnut.
They're amazing.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.706
Careful, buddy! It's hot!

10:48.114 --> 10:51.413
Are you trying to pick me up
to keep me from touching fire?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.585
Kiss me.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.586
Wait a minute.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.384
When you first met me,
did you think I was a child?

10:56.455 --> 10:57.490
Yes, I did, sir.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.524
Unbelievable.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.594
I knew I should have listened to my friends.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.329
Kofi said you were too good to be true.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.565
"Not ah" told me to
wait three days before I called you.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.667
And yet, here we are.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.869
Was anything even going to
happen between us tonight?

11:09.869 --> 11:10.903
No.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.271
But... But not because of your size.

11:12.271 --> 11:14.273
It's because I have a thing about intimacy.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.108
I'm the weird one. I'm weirder than you.

11:16.108 --> 11:17.576
How am I weird?

11:17.576 --> 11:19.311
You're not. That came out wrong.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.835
You came out wrong.

11:21.947 --> 11:24.817
Oh, and I lied about your show.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.785
I have seen it.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.881
Be careful crossing the...

11:33.926 --> 11:37.196
The lady will be having the tasting menu,
but with some substitutions.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.998
Instead of, uh... any of it...

11:38.998 --> 11:41.400
she'll have a cup of hot
water with a chicken bone in it

11:41.400 --> 11:43.265
and a bowl of salted ice cubes.

12:01.954 --> 12:02.978
A towel, sir?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.685
I have something on my ball.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.161
Mint?

12:17.670 --> 12:18.967
Good morning.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.604
Morning, everyone.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.577
Are you all right? You look very pale.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.745
I'm fine.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.047
Had a good hour's sleep last night.
Took a few showers.

12:28.047 --> 12:32.609
Is there anything you want
to talk about? I am a nurse.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.652
It's nothing. It's embarrassing.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.691
More embarrassing than your CD collection?

12:38.691 --> 12:41.455
I didn't know Michael
Bublé had that many albums.

12:41.961 --> 12:43.829
If you must know,

12:43.829 --> 12:44.830
I found a lump.

12:44.830 --> 12:45.819
On your testicle?

12:47.166 --> 12:48.267
Let me see it.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.203
No, thank you, I think I
have it under control --

12:53.339 --> 12:54.774
What?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.242
You're talking so fast

12:57.376 --> 12:58.900
Is that the subjunctive?

13:00.346 --> 13:01.447
How did you do that?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.506
I told you I was a professional.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.280
And you forgot to put on your underpants.

13:08.988 --> 13:11.590
So, uh... any big plans for your day off?

13:11.590 --> 13:13.683
I'm going to Prospect Park.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.721
It's my god-daughter's quinceneara.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.899
Oh, it's kind of like a debutante... ball?

13:19.899 --> 13:21.834
Hm. You did that on purpose.

13:21.834 --> 13:22.892
I did.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.561
Well...

13:25.304 --> 13:26.672
there is something there.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.307
It could be a number of things.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.975
You should get it checked out by a doctor.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.911
Thank you for telling me what I already know.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.946
You should work for The Huffington Post.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.038
I'm sorry.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.284
I'm sure you have
friends or family you can call.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.351
I'm fine.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.252
Oh, please. Don't try to be Señor Macho Solo.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.291
Which is actually what we call a "McRib" sandwich.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.292
I'm fine.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.693
I'm handling this... all alone.

13:53.432 --> 13:54.600
Jack.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.602
What are they doing about
this Julia Roberts movie?

13:56.602 --> 13:58.971
Aren't people over her? I mean, come on!

13:58.971 --> 14:00.439
Jenna, you're single like me.

14:00.439 --> 14:05.544
Do you think we need some mythical
soul mate to hold our hand through life?

14:05.544 --> 14:07.546
Why? Do you want to get married? I'll do it.

14:07.546 --> 14:08.547
What?

14:08.547 --> 14:10.182
Uh... Uh, no. Uh... Uh, never mind.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.684
Uh, the movie's going to work out fine.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.886
We're very close to securing
Janis Joplin's life rights.

14:13.886 --> 14:14.954
Close?

14:14.954 --> 14:16.555
I'm supposed to sing one
of her songs Friday night.

14:16.555 --> 14:17.957
Do we at least have the music rights?

14:17.957 --> 14:19.458
Uh... Yes and no, Jenna.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.695
Yes, I'm talking. Uh, no,
we do not have the music. But I'm on it.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.185
It's all going to be fine.

14:27.833 --> 14:28.901
Hello?

14:28.901 --> 14:30.336
Stuart, it's me.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.472
Uh... Look, Liz. I'm really busy right now.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.708
I just wanted to apologize for the other night.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.244
But I didn't get a chance to explain myself.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.576
I'm... kind of baby crazy...

14:40.646 --> 14:41.647
...of late.

14:41.647 --> 14:44.283
Socially inept and baby crazy.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.451
I feel like I'm in a beer commercial.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.286
Yeah, I get it. I'm a piece of work.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.954
But I really like you.

14:48.954 --> 14:51.946
And if you gave me another chance,
maybe this could be something.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.788
Liz, at this point in my life,
"maybe" just isn't good enough.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.665
Okay, here's a thought.
Did you see the Sex and the City movie?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.565
Once again, Liz, I am an adult man.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.670
Okay. Well, Miranda and Steve were
having issues because Steve cheated...

15:04.670 --> 15:06.105
Oh... So bored.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.106
But the point is...

15:07.106 --> 15:08.641
...they decided to take a break

15:08.641 --> 15:11.810
and then meet up at the
Brooklyn Bridge at such-and-such a time

15:11.810 --> 15:13.045
if they wanted to stay together.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.014
- Maybe we could do the same thing?

15:15.014 --> 15:17.244
Brooklyn Bridge this Saturday? 2:00 P.M.?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.184
Okay.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.719
But for whatever reason...

15:20.719 --> 15:22.888
...if I don't see you there...

15:22.888 --> 15:24.556
Take care, Liz Lemon.

15:24.556 --> 15:25.624
You too.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.327
Oh. And can you transfer me to
the Italian ambassador's office?

15:28.327 --> 15:30.420
Because I'd "like-a" to
"make-a" the prank phone call.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.627
Please hold.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.748
Jack. What are you doing here?

15:49.748 --> 15:52.216
I wanted to come by and
thank you for all your help.

15:52.584 --> 15:53.953
I wasn't sure what you were serving,

15:53.953 --> 15:57.589
so I brought a '65 Moët
and some "Pizza-Blasted" Pringles.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.954
That was very thoughtful.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.954
And I'm sorry if I was rude the other day.

16:01.026 --> 16:04.630
Oh, you were not being rude.
You were just being stupid.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.031
Did you go to the doctor?

16:06.031 --> 16:09.735
I had a biopsy and I'm waiting for
the results. So I'm handling it.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.498
Good. I'm glad.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.802
Excellent. So, uh... Here you go.

16:13.872 --> 16:15.100
Thank you.

16:17.543 --> 16:18.703
Jack, would you like to stay?

16:18.777 --> 16:20.379
I don't want to impose.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.780
Oh. Come on.

16:21.780 --> 16:25.614
Oh. Why, thank you. Okay.
Oh, thank you so much.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.553
All of these people are your family?

16:27.553 --> 16:30.181
Why are they smiling so much?
Who's being ostracized?

16:30.356 --> 16:32.415
Everybody, this is my friend, Jack.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.109
Hey. I need to ask your advice about Stuart.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.777
We decided to do this whole

16:51.777 --> 16:54.446
"meet-me-at-the-Brooklyn-Bridge-
if-you-still-want-to-be-together" thing

16:54.446 --> 16:55.714
from the Sex and the City movie?

16:55.714 --> 16:57.416
They do that a lot in movies.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.619
An Affair to Remember,
Sleepless in Seattle...

17:00.619 --> 17:03.689
And that remake of An Affair
to Remember that I was in...

17:03.689 --> 17:05.486
"A Blaffair to Rememblack".

17:06.290 --> 17:07.626
I just don't know what to do.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.526
Here's what you don't do.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.798
Be alone. We were never
meant to be alone, Lemon.

17:12.798 --> 17:17.201
Surround yourself with people and
love and babies with pierced ears.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.737
What is wrong with you?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.397
I've had a crazy 48 hours.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.441
It all started when I realized I'm probably dying.

17:22.441 --> 17:23.976
You see, I have this thing on my testicle.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.077
Ew, my God.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.645
No, no, no. It's okay.
Whatever happens, it's okay.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.947
I don't want to die alone.
And now, I don't have to.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.381
Because...

17:31.550 --> 17:34.110
I'm in love
with my mother's nurse.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.322
Wow. Now you have what me and Angie have.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.791
Minus the hypertension.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.893
Jack, slow down.
Have you been to a doctor?

17:40.893 --> 17:43.562
No, I'm waiting for the results of a biopsy.
We went to this picnic.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.264
Lemon, have you ever had a piragua?

17:45.264 --> 17:48.567
It's exactly like a snow-cone,
except they call it a piragua.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.039
It's my doctor's office...
You take it.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.040
No, Jack.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.064
Please.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.568
I'll do it.

17:59.845 --> 18:03.246
Hello? Yes? Okay.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.477
Thank you.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.653
The test was positive.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.990
No, no, no, no, no.
I mean "positive" like it's good.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.759
The test results were negative.

18:15.627 --> 18:18.858
Oh, I see your confusion! That is funny!

18:21.700 --> 18:22.701
Hey.

18:22.701 --> 18:27.035
Funny... Jack thought the
test results were positive.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.708
# Supersonic, idiotic,
disconnected, not respected...?

18:29.708 --> 18:32.643
# Who would ever really want to
go and top that... Top that...?

18:34.546 --> 18:35.547
Thank you.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.684
That was the rap song "Top That"
from the movie "Teen Witch".

18:38.684 --> 18:41.353
Once again, I apologize
that our regular warm-up comic

18:41.353 --> 18:43.455
O.D.'d at a gay man's apartment this morning.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.752
Thirty seconds.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.128
I've decided to go to the bridge tomorrow.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.095
You've inspired me.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.298
What if this experience hasn't changed me?

18:53.298 --> 18:57.769
Maybe everything I was feeling for
Elisa was just neediness and fear.

18:57.769 --> 19:01.874
I mean, can two people fall in
love over a benign gonad cyst?

19:01.874 --> 19:05.344
Why not? It's not about where things start.
It's about where it goes.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.574
Tracy told me that. He's kind of on a roll.

19:07.713 --> 19:11.016
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Janet Jopler!

19:11.016 --> 19:12.017
Who?

19:12.017 --> 19:14.747
Until we get the life rights,
we have to protect ourselves.

19:15.154 --> 19:21.760
# I'd like you to come up...
Come up... Come up and take it...?

19:21.760 --> 19:26.198
# Break another little chunk
of my love now, mister...?

19:26.198 --> 19:29.690
Also, uh, we didn't get the song.
I wrote this myself five minutes ago.

19:29.935 --> 19:35.532
# You know you bought it...
If life makes you sweet food...?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.103
Now, this, I like.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.553
Waiting for someone?

19:47.553 --> 19:48.554
What?

19:48.554 --> 19:49.555
What do you think you're doing?

19:49.555 --> 19:51.853
Oh, I'm so sorry! I
thought he was someone else!

19:54.359 --> 19:55.690
Liz.

19:55.794 --> 19:56.852
Wait.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.130
Shut it down!

20:03.335 --> 20:07.999
# Ah..?

20:09.374 --> 20:13.470
#...Ah?

20:14.446 --> 20:17.182
# Chunk of my lung...
Chunk of my lung...?

20:17.182 --> 20:23.087
# And take it... Take a big old
chunk of my lung now, baby...?

20:23.488 --> 20:29.859
# Take it... Break a big old chunk of my love...
Chunk of my love...?

20:29.928 --> 20:36.390
# You know you bought it...
If you buy it with things... Ow...?
