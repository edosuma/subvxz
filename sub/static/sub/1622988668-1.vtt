-No.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.000
Bleeding on the inside?

36:04.708 --> 36:05.875
How can you tell?

36:06.541 --> 36:07.708
It's inside.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.833
You're probably fine. Let's go.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.750
[thug] This is some good shit, doc.

36:30.833 --> 36:32.958
You should be very proud of yourself.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.125
This is not a toy.

36:37.208 --> 36:39.250
It's for medicinal use only.

[quiet giggling]

36:47.708 --> 36:48.791
So…

36:49.791 --> 36:51.625

36:56.000 --> 36:58.250
-A girl.
-[thugs laugh hysterically]

36:59.166 --> 37:02.416
A girl made you look
like you're from The Walking Dead?

37:02.500 --> 37:04.583
I've never felt
pain like this before, doc.

37:05.458 --> 37:07.416
[leader] She got us good, doc. I…

37:08.583 --> 37:10.208
I don't think I'll ever walk again.

37:11.750 --> 37:13.250
There must be an epidemic,

37:13.333 --> 37:16.291
'cause I got a guy in the next room
who's got similar symptoms.

37:17.250 --> 37:18.291
What do you mean?

37:18.375 --> 37:19.583
I mean…

37:20.500 --> 37:23.083

Keep talking, doc.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.666
-[Sam sighs]
-You're bleeding.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.416
It's just a scratch.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.166
It can get infected.

37:38.083 --> 37:42.166
Worms will get in there and lay eggs.
Then they'll have to cut your arm off.

37:44.583 --> 37:46.541
That's what they teach in school
these days?

37:47.125 --> 37:48.083

37:48.875 --> 37:51.166
Thank God we're going straight

[emotional music]

37:55.125 --> 37:56.208
Yeah.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.875
Is that why he didn't come?

37:59.625 --> 38:00.708
Is he sick?

38:01.708 --> 38:02.666
He…

38:03.916 --> 38:05.083
[Emily] It's okay.

38:05.166 --> 38:07.166
You don't have to lie for him.

38:08.041 --> 38:10.250
He never comes when he says he will.

Here, just let me help you.

Thank you.

38:28.708 --> 38:29.541
Sure.

38:31.833 --> 38:33.166
Are you sure it's her?

38:33.250 --> 38:35.625
[leader] Yeah. She dropped off
some guy she shot.

38:35.708 --> 38:38.375
Said she's going to come back
and pick him up later.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.208
-[thugs laugh]
-And the money?

38:40.875 --> 38:43.375
-She had it last time we saw her.
-[laughing]

38:43.958 --> 38:45.375

38:57.541 --> 39:00.458
-Do whatever it takes.
-Alright, alright, alright.

[elevator dings]

40:35.875 --> 40:37.125
I'll get the doctor.

40:51.166 --> 40:52.250
She's here.

40:53.750 --> 40:54.916
Shot in the shoulder.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.625
Maybe you should take your break now.

41:10.291 --> 41:12.125
So. My payment?

41:13.125 --> 41:15.583
-Oh! [sharp inhale]
-Shh.

41:15.666 --> 41:17.333
Transferred to your account.

41:18.375 --> 41:19.333
Now…

41:19.833 --> 41:21.458
What's the plan, doc?

41:21.541 --> 41:22.916
[hysterical laughter]

41:24.625 --> 41:25.791
[together] Oh.

41:25.875 --> 41:29.166
Once I stick her with this,
she'll start losing control of her arms.

41:29.250 --> 41:30.750
[snickering]

41:30.833 --> 41:32.666

Let me do this right.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.166
It's just a scratch.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.791
Well, scratches get infected.

42:00.875 --> 42:02.375
That's how you lose an arm.

42:03.125 --> 42:05.625
Mm. Yeah, I heard.

42:08.166 --> 42:09.541
[liquid sloshes]

42:10.500 --> 42:11.583
What happened to him?

42:12.916 --> 42:14.125
Someone shot him.

42:14.208 --> 42:16.333
I hear that's pretty lethal.

42:17.875 --> 42:19.458
Let's fix this.

42:19.541 --> 42:21.458
Don't. I'm good.

42:22.250 --> 42:24.125
Trust me, you'll need this.

42:25.083 --> 42:27.125
[loudly] I said, I'm good.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.250

43:05.916 --> 43:07.333
Those who killed my dad?

43:07.416 --> 43:10.375
I promise I'll explain,
but right now I need your help, okay?

43:10.458 --> 43:11.875
-Okay.
-Good.

43:11.958 --> 43:13.416

Careful. It's loaded.

44:07.916 --> 44:10.750
For a second there,
I thought it was someone dangerous.

44:11.625 --> 44:15.125
The only reason you're still alive
is 'cause Nathan wanted it that way.

44:16.458 --> 44:19.333
[quietly] Now, take my finger
and put it on the trigger.

44:19.416 --> 44:21.166
[leader] Well, it's over now.

44:21.708 --> 44:24.125
I'm going to tear you into little pieces.

44:24.625 --> 44:27.666
And I'm gonna love every second of it.

44:27.750 --> 44:29.000
Great. Hold that thought.

jerk move,
sending the Three Stooges after me.

48:45.041 --> 48:47.500
You left us no choice, Sam.

There's always a choice.

48:48.958 --> 48:51.291
[Nathan] Oh, well, then,
we can still figure this out.

48:51.375 --> 48:53.208
Just bring the money back.

48:53.291 --> 48:56.583

was blown to 1000 pieces.

You're no longer under our protection.

[Nathan] In your little massacre
earlier tonight,

you killed the wrong people.

But I was sent by you.

And you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

49:39.083 --> 49:40.208
So…

49:41.875 --> 49:43.750
It needs to be rectified.

How's this for business?

I'm the head of the HR department

To prevent an all-out war

50:41.000 --> 50:45.208
we would like to offer you
the woman responsible for your loss.

50:45.291 --> 50:47.541
So you had nothing to do with this?

50:47.625 --> 50:51.000
I can assure you, this is not how The Firm
conducts its business, sir.

50:51.083 --> 50:55.666
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.958
Now, I'm sending you her last location.

50:58.541 --> 51:01.500
I hope this is satisfactory, sir.

[defensively] No…
Where did you learn that expression?

-History Channel.
-Well…

53:19.666 --> 53:21.625
I am not a serial killer.

But… you kill people?

53:24.458 --> 53:25.833
Yes.

53:25.916 --> 53:27.833
So that makes you a killer.

53:27.916 --> 53:29.875
And you've killed more than one.

53:29.958 --> 53:31.333
That is serial.

53:40.458 --> 53:42.791
They kill people out of a compulsive urge.

53:45.583 --> 53:47.041
So, why do you kill them?

53:49.583 --> 53:51.083
For money?

1:05:28.791 --> 1:05:30.291
[men clamoring]

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:34.083
[music intensifies]

1:05:34.166 --> 1:05:35.541
[mockingly] Don't feel bad.

1:05:36.041 --> 1:05:37.541
Could happen to anyone.

1:05:37.625 --> 1:05:39.333
My hand is still paralyzed.

1:05:39.416 --> 1:05:40.958
Yeah, course it is.

1:05:41.041 --> 1:05:42.875
-It is.
-I know.

1:05:42.958 --> 1:05:43.791
[elevator dings]

1:05:51.833 --> 1:05:53.625
[tense music]

1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:56.458
[Scarlet] Right. After you, ladies.

1:05:57.208 --> 1:05:59.041
[Scarlet] Come on. Hurry up.

1:05:59.708 --> 1:06:01.708
-[Sam] Where does it go?
-Fucking Narnia.

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:02.791
Go. In.

1:06:03.291 --> 1:06:04.958
-In!
-[scoffs] Fine.

1:06:17.916 --> 1:06:20.958
-[Sam] No plan, huh?
-[Scarlet] Now is not the time.

1:06:21.916 --> 1:06:23.166
Out of my way.

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:28.625
[echoing boom]

1:06:28.708 --> 1:06:30.916
-[Sam] Need help, Ma?
-No, thank you.

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.208
I'm quite capable…

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.000
of disposing of one…
[grunts]

1:06:36.083 --> 1:06:37.166
…idiotic grate.

1:06:47.166 --> 1:06:48.625
[hatch creaking]

1:06:51.458 --> 1:06:53.583

[clattering]

1:07:13.541 --> 1:07:17.000
[breathless] That freezer is a mess.
It's completely unacceptable.

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:22.125
[dramatic music]

1:07:27.166 --> 1:07:29.333
-Come on.
-Are you kidding me?

1:07:29.875 --> 1:07:31.625
-We have to go.
-Go where?

1:07:31.708 --> 1:07:33.625
Obviously your plan was to end up here.

1:07:33.708 --> 1:07:35.708
-That was a long time ago.
-Mom…

1:07:36.458 --> 1:07:38.416
-I'm not going in there.
-Mom, listen.

1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:40.916
We need weapons and a car.
We need a safe house!

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.291
I'm not sure they'd let me in!

1:07:43.375 --> 1:07:45.041
Only one way to find out.

1:07:46.458 --> 1:07:48.583
-[dramatic music]
-[church bells chiming]

1:07:54.750 --> 1:07:55.875
Hey.

1:08:11.041 --> 1:08:13.625
For the record,
I still think this is a shit idea.

1:08:17.041 --> 1:08:18.625
[dramatic music plays]

1:08:23.666 --> 1:08:25.541
[music fades out]

1:08:27.250 --> 1:08:28.458
Madeleine?

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:32.833
-[Sam sighs]
-[gun cocking]

1:08:34.791 --> 1:08:37.791
[Anna May] Girls, I think I see a ghost.

1:08:42.708 --> 1:08:45.041
-Hi, Madeleine.
-Hi, Scarlet.

1:08:45.125 --> 1:08:46.291
[Scarlet] Florence.

1:08:48.750 --> 1:08:50.458
-Hi, Anna May.
-No.

1:08:51.125 --> 1:08:53.166
No, no. You don't get to talk.

1:08:54.291 --> 1:08:56.958
Because you're a ghost,
and ghosts can't talk.

1:08:57.458 --> 1:08:58.708
You know how I know that?

1:08:59.291 --> 1:09:00.666
Can we do this later?

1:09:00.750 --> 1:09:02.291
Because if ghosts could talk,

1:09:03.166 --> 1:09:05.875
they would say something
before disappearing.

1:09:05.958 --> 1:09:09.083
Or at least leave a note. But they can't.

1:09:09.166 --> 1:09:11.833
So, ipso facto, you're a ghost.

1:09:12.666 --> 1:09:14.250
-I'm sorry.
-[shouts] Fuck you.

1:09:14.333 --> 1:09:16.666
Language, Anna May.
There's a child present.

1:09:16.750 --> 1:09:18.041
Fine.

1:09:19.041 --> 1:09:21.583
-Fudge you.
-Fudge you.

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:23.625
-Fudge you!
-[giggles]

1:09:25.791 --> 1:09:27.666
-[ominous music]
-[Emily giggles]

1:09:27.750 --> 1:09:30.916
And why is there a toddler
in our place of business?

1:09:32.708 --> 1:09:33.708
The short version?

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:35.458
Please.

1:09:36.125 --> 1:09:39.000
Her father was killed
and she has nowhere else to go.

1:09:39.083 --> 1:09:40.708
I was downsized by The Firm,

1:09:40.791 --> 1:09:44.083
and they fed me to McAlester's
endless supply of thugs.

1:09:44.166 --> 1:09:45.791
And you decided to come here?

1:09:45.875 --> 1:09:47.708
Shall we return
at a more convenient time?

1:09:48.291 --> 1:09:49.541
Maybe you should.

1:09:49.625 --> 1:09:52.000
[Anna May] It seems like
whenever you come here,

1:09:52.083 --> 1:09:53.708
you bring a war with you.

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:57.125
Bring your problems--

1:09:58.750 --> 1:10:00.125
We need to table this.

1:10:00.208 --> 1:10:02.000
[loud bang at door]

1:10:03.875 --> 1:10:05.041
Seconded.

1:10:05.583 --> 1:10:06.750
Let's go down.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:13.625
[multiple phones ringing]

1:10:15.208 --> 1:10:18.333
[phones ringing]

1:10:19.333 --> 1:10:20.916
[suspenseful music]

1:10:22.666 --> 1:10:24.000
[loud, resonant bang]

1:10:24.916 --> 1:10:26.291
Go and take Emily.

1:10:26.791 --> 1:10:28.291
I'll buy us some time.

1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:33.041
-I think I should stay.
-[banging]

1:10:35.333 --> 1:10:36.458
No.

1:10:37.041 --> 1:10:38.541
I screwed this up.

1:10:39.041 --> 1:10:41.333
-I'll clean up my own mess.
-[banging]

1:10:42.041 --> 1:10:44.666
We'll meet at the diner
once I've finished them off.

1:10:45.583 --> 1:10:47.958
-Go.
-[banging at door]

1:10:48.041 --> 1:10:49.208
Please.

1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:52.541
[whispers] Come.

1:10:55.125 --> 1:10:57.708
Are you sure?
I could use the target practice.

1:10:57.791 --> 1:10:58.791
Mm-mm.

1:10:59.291 --> 1:11:00.541
Anna May was right.

1:11:01.916 --> 1:11:03.958
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

1:11:05.833 --> 1:11:08.416
[dramatic music intensifies]

1:11:13.333 --> 1:11:15.750
-[Emily] I'm staying with you.
-[sighs]

1:11:16.250 --> 1:11:18.041
-No. No, you're not.
-[door bangs]

1:11:18.125 --> 1:11:20.875
You're going to the basement,
where it's safe.

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:23.458
But you need me. I'm your apprentice.

1:11:23.541 --> 1:11:25.291
[whispers] Okay, listen, Emily.

1:11:25.375 --> 1:11:28.750
The bad men are coming.
I really need you to go with my mom.

1:11:28.833 --> 1:11:31.333
No! I want to stay with you.

1:11:31.416 --> 1:11:32.708
-You can't.
-But why?

1:11:32.791 --> 1:11:34.291
Because…

1:11:35.375 --> 1:11:36.416
[swallows hard]

1:11:38.791 --> 1:11:40.500
Because I killed your father.

1:11:42.250 --> 1:11:45.291
You're lying.
You just want to get rid of me.

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.375
[soft emotional music]

1:11:47.875 --> 1:11:49.291
Your dad, he, um…

1:11:50.291 --> 1:11:52.500
He stole from some very bad people.

1:11:54.083 --> 1:11:55.166
And they hired me.

1:11:55.666 --> 1:11:57.041
[door bangs]

1:11:57.666 --> 1:11:58.875
And I shot him.

1:12:05.708 --> 1:12:07.291
[Emily sobs quietly]

1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:13.083
-[Emily sniffs]
-Come on. Let's go.

1:12:17.625 --> 1:12:18.708
[door bangs]

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:23.500
I need weapons.

1:12:23.583 --> 1:12:25.250
Try the self-help section.

1:12:31.833 --> 1:12:33.041

[suspenseful music]

1:12:58.958 --> 1:13:01.541
-[Scarlet] I have to help her.
-You need my permission?

1:13:01.625 --> 1:13:04.333
-I can't bail on her again.
-Why? You're good at it.

1:13:04.416 --> 1:13:08.333
I'm sorry I couldn't give it up back then
and just stay here with you.

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:12.583
[sighs]

1:13:17.916 --> 1:13:19.250
You're human.

1:13:20.041 --> 1:13:21.458
You screwed up.

1:13:21.541 --> 1:13:25.041
I can only imagine
how painful it was leaving her behind.

1:13:28.291 --> 1:13:29.791
[banging intensifies]

1:13:32.916 --> 1:13:34.291
[metal screeching]

1:13:38.083 --> 1:13:39.625
Leaving us all behind.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:43.291
But she grew up to be a fine woman.

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:49.416
[door bangs]

1:13:51.333 --> 1:13:53.250
I never wanted this life for her.

1:14:00.541 --> 1:14:01.958
Maybe it was meant to be.

1:14:02.041 --> 1:14:04.958
Or maybe she wanted to be
just like her mother.

1:14:09.750 --> 1:14:10.958

1:14:12.500 --> 1:14:14.500

1:14:15.458 --> 1:14:16.583
I missed you.

1:14:27.250 --> 1:14:29.083
We kept these ladies for you.

1:14:33.583 --> 1:14:35.500
[dramatic sting]

1:14:35.583 --> 1:14:37.750
[Anna May] Just meet us at the diner.

1:14:37.833 --> 1:14:39.583
Come back in one piece, okay?

1:14:40.708 --> 1:14:42.083
Both of you.

Is anything broken?

-Are you bleeding?
-I'm fine.

1:16:46.416 --> 1:16:47.875
Bleeding on the inside?

1:16:49.625 --> 1:16:51.166
The rest of them are coming.

1:16:51.250 --> 1:16:53.208
Would it kill you to say thank you?

1:16:54.333 --> 1:16:56.625
You can still go, Ma. I'll cover you.

1:16:57.291 --> 1:16:59.541
-And miss all the fun?

1:17:32.166 --> 1:17:34.625
You should've stayed away
from this line of work.

1:17:34.708 --> 1:17:36.291
Are you kidding, Ma?

1:17:37.458 --> 1:17:38.500
You left.

1:17:39.041 --> 1:17:41.791
Killing people was the only thing
I knew how to do.

1:17:42.333 --> 1:17:45.833
Okay, maybe it wasn't the best environment
to raise a child in.

1:17:45.916 --> 1:17:47.375
[sarcastic] You think?

1:17:48.833 --> 1:17:50.416
It made you who you are.

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:52.250
At least we can agree on that.

1:17:55.416 --> 1:17:57.208
[soft emotional music]

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:08.708
And you are a strong, smart,
incredibly impressive young woman.

1:18:10.916 --> 1:18:14.291
There's not a single person on earth
I'd rather kill people with.

1:18:15.916 --> 1:18:17.083
Thanks, Ma.

1:18:18.166 --> 1:18:21.750
[Madeleine] You're so strong!
You can't be 8 and three quarters.

1:18:21.833 --> 1:18:22.875
[Emily] I am.

1:18:22.958 --> 1:18:25.625
[Madeleine] You sure you're not
28 and three quarters?

[suspenseful music]

1:18:45.625 --> 1:18:46.833
[whispers] Oh.

1:18:47.541 --> 1:18:49.083
We're not leaving.

1:18:49.583 --> 1:18:52.625
Scarlet's still a librarian,
no matter if she's an asshole.

1:18:52.708 --> 1:18:54.458
-Language.
-Right.

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.416
-So these…
-Jerks.

1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.416
…jerks up there

1:19:00.166 --> 1:19:02.708
just made the biggest mistake
of their lives.

1:19:02.791 --> 1:19:06.791
[Anna May] They stepped into our library
and threatened our own flesh and blood.

1:19:06.875 --> 1:19:08.708
They're not gonna push us around.

1:19:08.791 --> 1:19:12.500
They're not gonna scare us off.
This ends now.

1:19:12.583 --> 1:19:15.541
Madeleine, finish getting the van ready.

1:19:15.625 --> 1:19:19.666
Florence, you and I are going up there
to thin the herd.

1:19:20.291 --> 1:19:24.458
We're gonna bring the sky down
on their mother-fudging heads.

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.000
