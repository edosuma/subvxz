WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:04.438
We've decided
to take a second look

00:04.472 --> 00:06.074
at the O'Connell case.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.809
Gabriel Hicks is convicted
of robbery, kidnapping

00:08.842 --> 00:10.044
and first-degree murder.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.646
The victim's license
was discovered

00:12.680 --> 00:14.415
hidden at each
of the crime scenes

00:14.448 --> 00:16.784
and always with a smear
of blood over the face.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.819
Whoever murdered
Lieutenant O'Connell

00:18.852 --> 00:19.753
was a serial killer.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.755
You said yourself
there's reasonable doubt.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.791
Guy takes one lefty swing
and you want to throw

00:23.824 --> 00:25.559
the whole investigation
out the window?

00:25.593 --> 00:28.662
We got an eyewitness
saying it wasn't him.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.231
HICKS:
To my lawyer, Jessica Shaeffer,

00:30.264 --> 00:32.233
I can't thank her enough
for believing in me

00:32.266 --> 00:34.535
and seeing justice
through to the end. Thank you.

00:34.568 --> 00:35.436
You were right.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.138
Hicks is guilty.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.106
He should've been locked up
all along.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.373
I'm not his lawyer anymore,

00:39.407 --> 00:40.841
but everything I know
is still privileged.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.143
Don't stop digging.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.752
TORRES: Man, that is one way
I do not want to go out.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.354
BISHOP:
Yeah.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.490
I doubt Jessica wanted
it this way, either.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.628
Hey, McGee.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.096
How'd it go with the witnesses?

01:02.130 --> 01:04.865
No, no one saw anything
before the explosion.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.534
Checked for surveillance
footage.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.669
There's no traffic cameras
in the immediate area.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.439
Well, a car doesn't just explode
for no reason.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.873
Hopefully Abby
can work her magic

01:12.906 --> 01:14.175
and figure out
what happened.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.176
Well, I can tell you that.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.610
Someone was
targeting Jessica.

01:16.644 --> 01:20.114
The blast didn't originate
from a fuel line

01:20.148 --> 01:21.682
or, uh, the engine.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.318
Happened underneath
the driver's seat.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.621
It's a sure sign
of a car bomb.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.690
When did you become such
an expert on car bombs?

01:29.723 --> 01:31.192
I made them when
I was undercover.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.860
Well, Sloane got very lucky.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.562
I mean, if she was a
couple inches closer,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.164
would've been a
different story.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.166
And Jessica Shaeffer
wasn't so lucky.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.637
Will you both quit
looking at me like that?

01:43.671 --> 01:44.872
Please.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.740
I'm fine.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.376
I'd rather hear
that from a doctor.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.311
This is exactly where
I need to be

01:50.344 --> 01:53.214
and if no one else is gonna
state the obvious, allow me.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.216
This has Hicks written
all over it.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.850
But why kill his lawyer?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.752
She's the only one
that was on his side.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.521
Not as of this afternoon.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.223
Jessica resigned

02:02.256 --> 02:04.392
as Hicks' counsel.
Did she say why?

02:04.425 --> 02:06.894
She couldn't because
of client confidentiality,

02:06.927 --> 02:08.229
but she said

02:08.262 --> 02:09.497
we needed to keep digging.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.165
So why the sudden change
of heart?

02:11.199 --> 02:12.833
Jessica must have
uncovered something

02:12.866 --> 02:14.268
that proved Hicks' guilt.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.437
Something worth killing over.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.841
*

02:51.305 --> 02:52.673
Hi, can I get a...

02:52.706 --> 02:54.542
Small triple shot latte

02:54.575 --> 02:55.843
with coconut milk?

02:55.876 --> 02:57.711
How did you know?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.480
You ordered the same
thing yesterday.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.415
Do you remember all
of your customers' orders?

03:01.449 --> 03:02.883
No, just the pretty ones.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.585
I'm Danielle.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.919
I'm...

03:05.953 --> 03:07.555
Gabriel Hicks.

03:07.588 --> 03:10.924
Born February 7, 1983, from
Wheeling, West Virginia.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.293
Do I know you?

03:12.326 --> 03:13.561
No, but we know you.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.795
NCIS.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.230
We have a couple questions

03:16.264 --> 03:17.665
about Jessica Shaeffer's murder.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.901
Did you say murder?

03:20.934 --> 03:23.237
I have to go.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.539
Oops.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.774
I say that too loud?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.776
She scares easy.
That's a bummer.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.245
I'm not sure what's going on,
but ask me whatever you want.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.380
I've got nothing to hide.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.814
All right.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.383
We'll see about that.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.818
Let's take a drive.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.354
Thank you.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.393
You're not making any sense.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.328
Why would I kill Jessica?

03:47.361 --> 03:48.596
She made me a free man.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.997
I owed her.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.400
You had a strange way
of showing it.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.338
I had nothing to do with that.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.672
I'm telling you
the truth.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.008
I doubt that.
How could I have?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.576
I was working
at the coffee shop all day.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.877
Check with my manager.
McGEE: We did.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.546
Your shift didn't start
till 3:00.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.348
That gave you plenty of time
to plant the bomb

04:07.381 --> 04:08.649
in Jessica's car beforehand.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.017
This is absurd.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.019
How would I even know how
to make an explosive?

04:12.052 --> 04:14.388
Oh, I bet you learned
a lot of new tricks

04:14.422 --> 04:15.589
during your time in prison.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.391
For a crime I didn't commit.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.926
I'm a victim, too.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.394
You're breaking my heart.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.062
Jessica was the only friend

04:22.095 --> 04:23.731
I had.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.400
I'm torn up over this.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.303
Really? 'Cause when Agents
Bishop and Torres told you

04:29.337 --> 04:31.405
about Jessica's death,
you barely flinched.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.873
I thought
they were lying.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.444
I'm not too trusting of cops
since that FBI agent

04:36.477 --> 04:38.412
buried evidence to convict me.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.448
I lost ten years
of my life

04:40.481 --> 04:43.517
because of him, so, yeah, I'm
wary of law enforcement types.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.553
Wouldn't you be?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.958
How the hell does he know
I'm in here?

04:50.991 --> 04:52.092
He can probably hear you

04:52.125 --> 04:53.461
grinding your teeth
through the wall.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.463
Can't help it. I hate
being sidelined.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.732
Smug son of a bitch.

04:58.766 --> 04:59.933
He's enjoying this.
Look at him.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.335
Not even breaking a sweat
in there.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.903
Hicks knows we got nothing
on him.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.406
He's playing with us.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.374
HICKS:
It's obvious I'm being set up

05:06.407 --> 05:08.041
to take the fall like before.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.477
I think it's best
if I get a lawyer.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.379
Mm. Do that.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.514
And don't leave out how
your last one ended up dead

05:13.547 --> 05:14.715
after she dropped you.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.649
That's not what happened.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.118
I was the one that let go
of Jessica

05:18.151 --> 05:19.653
so she could focus
on her other clients.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.622
And we can't ask her now,
can we?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.391
It's funny

05:23.424 --> 05:24.725
how that worked out.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.527
I thought you were on
my side, Agent Gibbs.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.397
After all, it was your testimony
that got me freed from prison.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.738
GIBBS:
Rule number 51.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.542
Sometimes you're wrong.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.577
Hicks give you anything?

05:43.611 --> 05:47.080
No. Not yet. We're
just getting started.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.416
No, you're done.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.685
With all the bad press
surrounding NCIS

05:51.719 --> 05:53.387
after Hicks' wrongful
conviction,

05:53.421 --> 05:54.455
we need to tread carefully.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.425
Leon, he's guilty.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.926
So you've said.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.994
But your gut won't hold up
in court, Gibbs.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.930
If there's nothing
connecting Hicks

06:02.963 --> 06:05.132
to Jessica Shaeffer's death,
you need to cut him loose.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.434
He will kill again.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.436
Then bring me
something concrete.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.937
Until you do that,
my hands are tied.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.477
Hey. You're free to go.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.811
You're kidding.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.459
I'm sorry I
couldn't help.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.794
I do hope you catch
Jessica's killer soon.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.464
Who knows who could be next?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.599
I would advise you
to leave this building

06:38.632 --> 06:40.468
while you can still
walk, Mr. Hicks.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.135
Are you threatening me,
Director Vance?

06:42.169 --> 06:44.204
Was I not clear?
Let me say it again.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.540
Leave now.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.550
Strike one, Agent Gibbs.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.488
Agent Fornell.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.789
Or should I say
former agent?

07:01.822 --> 07:04.558
I heard the FBI sacked ya.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.560
Tough break.
I don't have to be an agent

07:06.594 --> 07:09.029
to put your ass behind bars.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.931
And trust me,

07:10.964 --> 07:12.232
you'll be back there
soon enough.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.536
I wouldn't count on it.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.560
Abby?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.895
Down here.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.066
My favorite thing.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.701
Lawyer's car give you anything?

07:47.735 --> 07:50.771
Enough to confirm Torres'
suspicion about a car bomb.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.873
I found remnants
of a metallic disc

07:52.906 --> 07:54.207
under the driver's
side carriage.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.676
Any prints left behind?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.611
No, but that is
positive thinking.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.846
I like it. Keep it up.

07:58.879 --> 07:59.980
I'm positive
because I know

08:00.013 --> 08:01.081
you got something
else, Abby.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.650
You always do.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.917
You're like a
forensics magician.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.152
I like the sound of that.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.854
Did my positivity pay off?

08:06.887 --> 08:08.556
See for yourself.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.892
I give you...

08:11.925 --> 08:13.794
Jessica Shaeffer's
cell phone.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.796
Wasn't destroyed in the blast?
Partially.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.831
But the battery compartment
was intact,

08:17.865 --> 08:20.834
which is where
I found this.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.104
REEVES:
An electronic bug.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.739
Somebody planted it
in her phone

08:25.773 --> 08:27.107
so they could listen in
on all of her phone calls.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.876
That has to be Hicks.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.210
What is he so
paranoid about

08:30.243 --> 08:32.946
that he has to keep close tabs
on his own lawyer?

08:32.980 --> 08:34.848
McGEE:
Jessica Shaeffer,

08:34.882 --> 08:37.317
38, a graduate
of Georgetown Law.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.120
She worked in the public
defenders office since 2010,

08:40.153 --> 08:41.989
which is how she got involved
with Gabriel Hicks.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.591
Until late yesterday afternoon.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.058
She resigned as his counsel.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.860
Now, we don't know how long
the bug was planted

08:46.894 --> 08:48.061
in Jessica's phone,

08:48.095 --> 08:49.129
so we pulled her call logs

08:49.162 --> 08:50.964
from the past
couple weeks.
Any connect to Hicks?

08:50.998 --> 08:54.134
Nothing yet.
Thank you.
Uh, scratch that, McGee.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.570
Yesterday morning,

08:56.604 --> 08:58.839
Jessica called
the Department of Corrections

08:58.872 --> 09:00.140
to schedule a visitation

09:00.173 --> 09:01.308
with an inmate she interviewed

09:01.341 --> 09:02.943
hours before she was killed.

09:02.976 --> 09:03.811
What's the connection?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.846
Inmate in question
served time with Hicks

09:05.879 --> 09:07.948
when he was first convicted
ten years ago.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.950
Who is it?
Uh, McGee,

09:09.983 --> 09:11.752
you're gonna want
to sit down for this.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.654
Me Why?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.589
BISHOP: The inmate
Jessica Shaeffer met with

09:15.623 --> 09:16.790
was...

09:16.824 --> 09:18.926
Paul Triff.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.828
TORRES: What? Hold on.
As in the guy

09:20.861 --> 09:22.596
who carved up three bodies

09:22.630 --> 09:23.864
with an electric knife
in McGee's apartment

09:23.897 --> 09:26.634
and buried a mummified body
under the floor?

09:26.667 --> 09:27.801
That Paul Triff?

09:27.835 --> 09:29.102
BISHOP:
I am afraid so.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.604
It turns out he and Hicks

09:30.638 --> 09:32.272
were cellmates for six months.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.642
That must be why
Jessica went to see him.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.343
If Hicks was the one
that bugged her phone,

09:36.376 --> 09:38.078
then he knew she was
digging into his past.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.714
Only one way to find out.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.249
McGee, go see Triff.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.684
Find out what he knows.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.185
Me?

09:45.218 --> 09:46.987
Boss, you sure you don't want
to talk to him instead?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.289
You know him
better than I do.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.258
Anyone want to trade?

09:51.291 --> 09:53.827
Um, I have to look at my screen
and stuff.

09:54.762 --> 09:55.729
I got a thing.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.632
Oh.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.933
Hope you made
an appointment.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.802
I've got
a very busy schedule.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.704
That why you no-showed
this morning?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.906
You got a lot of eyes
on this case now.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.775
Everything's got to be done
aboveboard.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.011
I let this happen.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.345
I got to fix it.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.681
Not your fault, Tobias.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.848
Hell it isn't.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.984
If I'd done my job right
the first time,

10:17.017 --> 10:17.951
Hicks would still be in prison.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.319
If it weren't for my testimony,

10:19.352 --> 10:20.854
Hicks would never be released.

10:20.888 --> 10:21.855
And I wouldn't
have been fired

10:21.889 --> 10:23.223
by the FBI.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.392
What?

10:25.425 --> 10:26.860
I'm just saying.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.862
We both played a part

10:28.896 --> 10:31.699
in Hicks being
back on the street,

10:31.732 --> 10:34.634
which is why it's on us
to stop him...

10:36.003 --> 10:38.906
...the right way.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.713
Got to say,

10:45.746 --> 10:49.049
reading Triff's file,
he sounds fascinating.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.751
Unhinged is more like it.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.920
Well, that goes without saying.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.888
Well-adjusted individuals
don't butcher people

10:54.922 --> 10:56.323
in their living rooms.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.325
Or stare at people like
they want to eat their face.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.793
Triff's not a cannibal.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.962
Yet. Okay,
but if he branches out,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.430
I don't want to be his
guinea pig.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.065
GUARD: Open up!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.405
Mm.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.907
Agent McGee.

11:13.941 --> 11:17.144
Well, I must have been
a very good boy.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.979
My birthday wish
came true.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.849
And you are?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.984
Hiya.
Agent Jack Sloane.

11:29.890 --> 11:33.961
Raw-cut,
nappa leather trench.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.429
Unlined,
double-breasted.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.765
Spectacular.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.033
May I touch it?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.201
Not if you want
your hand back.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.004
Oh, pity.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.944
Well...
three visitors

11:50.978 --> 11:52.345
in two days.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.181
Aren't I the popular one?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.817
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't be jealous.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.187
You're still my favorite.
That's why we're here.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.822
We wanted to ask you
about your meeting

12:01.855 --> 12:03.891
with Jessica Shaeffer.
The lawyer.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.094
Yeah

12:07.127 --> 12:08.796
She was killed
in a car bomb last night,

12:08.829 --> 12:10.297
hours after visiting you.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.099
Don't look at me.
I've been locked up in here.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.801
And besides,
my methods are

12:13.834 --> 12:16.536
far more, uh... hands-on.
We're aware.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.972
You know, I even tried
to warn her

12:19.006 --> 12:21.308
that it was a mistake
to come see me.

12:23.310 --> 12:27.014
So... how did Hicks find out?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.481
We think that
he bugged her phone.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.051
Well, it was clever for him.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.853
What did Jessica want from you?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.255
She was so insistent
on finding out the truth

12:35.288 --> 12:36.857
about Hicks.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.859
But when I finally
told her,

12:38.892 --> 12:41.094
wow.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.064
I don't think that
she was fully prepared.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.134
You're saying Hicks admitted
to killing Lieutenant O'Connell?

12:48.902 --> 12:52.005
Well, among others.
Yes,

12:52.039 --> 12:54.574
he was very talkative,
back when he was a fish.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.510
He wanted so badly
to impress me

12:57.544 --> 12:59.412
that he ended up telling me,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.949
well... everything.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.216
Convenient.
You know, the lawyer

13:03.250 --> 13:05.085
didn't believe me, either,

13:05.118 --> 13:06.419
at first.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.021
Not until I told her

13:08.055 --> 13:10.157
that I had proof
about Hicks' guilt.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.192
What proof?
You think I'm going to give you

13:12.225 --> 13:13.426
that information for free?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.028
No.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.363
No, no. Tsk-tsk.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.198
You are going to need

13:18.231 --> 13:20.200
to wine and dine me.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.602
It's a small price to pay
for catching Hicks, though.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.937
I mean, don't you think?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.038
We're done here.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.207
Eh, da, da, da, da.

13:27.240 --> 13:32.212
Just to show you
how serious I am...

13:32.245 --> 13:33.513
I'll give you a freebie.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.449
Hicks always said
that there was a loose end

13:36.483 --> 13:38.085
that he needed to tie up.

13:39.619 --> 13:43.056
Something about a witness

13:43.090 --> 13:44.992
that he should
have killed.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.527
Some old lady.
Mary Smith?

13:47.560 --> 13:52.165
Uh, uh... I mean,
it sounds familiar.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.434
Mary was only a witness
in the O'Connell case,

13:54.467 --> 13:57.204
which Hicks can't be
re-tried for.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.172
There would be
no reason to kill her.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.941
Reason.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.578
Who needs a reason?

14:07.547 --> 14:10.850
Is it lunchtime
already, Agnes?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.257
It's been a long time, Mary.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.196
You and I have a lot
to talk about.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.610
BISHOP:
Excuse me.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.081
So, the nurse on duty
reported seeing Mary

14:41.114 --> 14:42.482
during her noon rounds,
but when she went

14:42.515 --> 14:43.951
to check on her
an hour later,

14:43.984 --> 14:46.119
Mary was missing.
Any security camera?

14:46.153 --> 14:48.321
No, the security on the premises
is pretty lax,

14:48.355 --> 14:49.656
so anyone could have
come and gone.

14:49.689 --> 14:53.360
Boss, one of the residents
saw Mary forced

14:53.393 --> 14:56.529
into a silver sedan by a man
matching Hicks' description.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.198
Ran the plate number
on the car.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.632
It was reported stolen
this morning.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.101
BOLO's already out.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.503
So, first Jessica Shaeffer,

15:03.536 --> 15:05.205
and now Mary Smith.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.407
It looks like Hicks is
tying up loose ends.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.242
McGEE: Who's next
on the list?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.078
Not waiting around
to find out.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.454
Your shift started
20 minutes ago.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.655
You get held up
somewhere?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.557
You know traffic in D.C.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.559
Can be murder.
Where is she?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.228
Where's who?
Mary Smith.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.297
Witness saw you take her
from her nursing home.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.399
They must be mistaken.
Oh.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.303
Witnesses can be
so unreliable.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.138
You should know that
better than anyone.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.041
Do you mind?

15:41.074 --> 15:42.709
I'm late for work.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.112
Some of us have jobs to get to.

15:45.145 --> 15:48.415
See, I got this thing
against psychopathic scumbags

15:48.448 --> 15:49.649
who target old ladies.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.352
What's the matter?

15:52.385 --> 15:54.454
You too scared to pick on
someone your own size?

15:54.487 --> 15:58.625
Sorry, you're not
exactly my taste.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.129
But give my best
to your daughter.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.064
Oh!

16:04.097 --> 16:05.565
Did I hit a nerve?

16:05.598 --> 16:06.599
Tobias...

16:06.633 --> 16:08.301
Tobias!
Stay out of this, Gibbs.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.536
It's between him and me.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.204
You're doing exactly
what he wants.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.339
I don't care!

16:12.372 --> 16:13.440
I know he's guilty.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.508
Enough!

16:15.542 --> 16:17.177
GIBBS:
Go on, take a walk.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.583
Get out of here.

16:25.752 --> 16:29.189
Your friend is
a seriously disturbed man.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.191
If he comes near me again,
I'll have to press charges.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.593
We don't find Mary Smith alive,

16:33.626 --> 16:35.728
I'll be the one
paying you a visit.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.698
Strike two, Agent Gibbs.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.633
Ticktock.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.310
How did that feel?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.579
Did you have to pull him
off me so soon?

16:52.612 --> 16:53.580
I was just getting into it.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.182
Where'd you plant
the tracker?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.516
Under his coat collar.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.319
And it is up and running.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.288
Now we'll know
everywhere Hicks goes,

17:01.321 --> 17:02.489
which will, hopefully,
lead us to Mary Smith,

17:02.522 --> 17:05.625
if she's alive.
She is.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.627
Your gut tell you that?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.662
It's all part
of Hicks' game.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.199
Even so, he's not gonna
keep her that way much longer.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.766
His previous victims
were all killed

17:13.800 --> 17:16.103
within 48 hours
of their abductions.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.338
Which is why we're not putting
all our eggs in one basket.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.307
You got a wild card
I don't know about?

17:20.340 --> 17:22.309
Eh, yeah, something like that.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.681
Has Gibbs lost
his damn mind?

17:28.715 --> 17:32.119
He wants NCIS to cut
a deal with Paul Triff?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.354
Yes. And I agree with him.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.588
I knew I should have
called in sick today.

17:35.622 --> 17:39.659
I am aware of Triff's...
colorful history, okay?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.528
Three life sentences for murder.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.530
Illegal possession
of a firearm.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.632
And multiple counts
of unlawful mutilation

17:45.665 --> 17:46.866
of a corpse.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.435
I would say that we are

17:48.468 --> 17:50.303
a few shades past "colorful."

17:50.337 --> 17:52.705
You and I both know that
inmates brag to each other.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.443
Triff spent six months
as Hicks' cellmate.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.844
His insight could be invaluable.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.580
And you think that
we can trust Paul Triff?

18:00.613 --> 18:03.583
No. Are you kidding me?
Not trust him.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.553
Use him. From what I've deduced,

18:06.586 --> 18:08.855
Triff has a massive ego.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.723
The attention Hicks has gotten

18:10.757 --> 18:13.660
only fuels Triff's desire
to see him caught.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.331
Better to deal with
the devil we know

18:18.365 --> 18:20.633
than the devil we don't.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.801
Precisely.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.604
If we can save Mary Smith,

18:24.637 --> 18:26.273
and catch Hicks
in the process,

18:26.306 --> 18:28.775
wouldn't that be
worth it?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.513
What are Triff's demands?

18:33.546 --> 18:38.651
Well, they are...

18:38.685 --> 18:41.621
not unreasonable,

18:41.654 --> 18:43.456
though a tad bit
unorthodox.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.593
And the other shoe drops.

18:46.626 --> 18:50.197
Triff wants a "48-hour
work furlough

18:50.230 --> 18:52.799
outside the prison while
he assists with the case"?

18:52.832 --> 18:55.202
With two non-negotiables.
"Agent McGee

18:55.235 --> 18:57.837
"must be assigned to
supervise inmate Triff

18:57.870 --> 19:00.273
for the duration
of the investigation."

19:00.307 --> 19:01.708
Keep reading.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.343
"Triff will only reside

19:03.376 --> 19:05.245
"at his last place
of residence

19:05.278 --> 19:06.446
during the furlough."

19:06.479 --> 19:08.581
What residence?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.850
BISHOP:
How long has he been like this?

19:10.883 --> 19:12.752
REEVES:
Since he got a call from Vance.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.788
He just found out he's gonna
bunk with a serial killer.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.259
There is just no
sympathy card for that.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.393
McGee?

19:20.427 --> 19:21.861
BISHOP:
McGee...

19:21.894 --> 19:23.763
Hey, you okay?

19:23.796 --> 19:25.765
Is this really happening?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.800
Seriously, is this happening,
or is this just

19:27.834 --> 19:29.702
a really bad nightmare?

19:29.736 --> 19:30.703
It's actually both.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.705
Hey, anything I can do?

19:32.739 --> 19:34.207
Want me to talk
to Delilah?

19:34.241 --> 19:36.209
No, no, no, I have sent
Delilah and the twins

19:36.243 --> 19:37.944
to stay with her mother
for the course of the case.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.580
I left out all specifics.
Smart thinking.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.285
Well, that is the last of it.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.388
Consider your place
successfully de-babyfied, McGee.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.290
Just saying that bums me out.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.459
Hearing it does, too.
But it's safer this way.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.561
I don't want Triff to know
anything about me or my family.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.330
Right. I'm just gonna do
one more little once-over here

19:57.364 --> 19:59.799
just to make sure.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.768
Uh, you might want to
remove all cutlery, too.

20:01.801 --> 20:02.769
Hey, good call.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.337
REEVES:
Aren't we all going

20:04.371 --> 20:05.672
a little overboard here?

20:05.705 --> 20:06.773
Triff's one man.

20:06.806 --> 20:07.740
I mean, how bad
can he be?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.309
He expertly dismembered

20:09.342 --> 20:10.743
three human bodies
with a carving knife

20:10.777 --> 20:12.579
in this very room while
eating Chinese takeout.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.714
Um, I'll give you a hand.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.886
Everything is gonna
be fine, McGee.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.654
Triff is gonna be

20:21.688 --> 20:23.756
locked up in chains in
this cell the entire time.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.458
And Reeves is here for backup.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.893
We got all the bases
covered.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.528
Right.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.741
(leg chains clattering
against floor)

20:46.546 --> 20:48.615
Home, sweet home.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.750
Gotta go.
I gotta go.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.789
Something I said?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.431
McGEE:
You sure the lock is secure?

21:04.464 --> 21:06.766
Unless he has a blowtorch
in his trousers,

21:06.799 --> 21:09.502
Triff ain't going anywhere.
Well, I wouldn't
put it past him.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.873
I'll handle the paperwork.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.643
All right.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.479
TRIFF: I don't recall this cage
being a part of my deal.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.913
It's not.
It's part of mine.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.482
If you don't like it,
we can send you back

21:22.515 --> 21:23.750
to Maryland Correctional.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.919
No need.
I'm amenable.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.755
You're the one
in charge, roomie.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.891
I've missed this place.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.893
You know, it looks the same,

21:33.926 --> 21:36.396
but the smells,
they're different.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.964
Well, that's because there's
no dead bodies

21:37.997 --> 21:39.332
decaying under the floor.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.936
You dug up old Joe
from under the tub. Hmm?

21:43.970 --> 21:46.038
I'm kidding.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.007
I wouldn't destroy
a hundred-year-old subway tile

21:48.040 --> 21:50.377
on that Neanderthal. Mm-mm.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.912
I dumped him in the river,
let the fish do the work.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.814
Another joke?
See?

21:54.847 --> 21:57.584
You really do get me,
don't you, huh?

21:57.617 --> 21:58.985
REEVES:
Thank you, Officer.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.121
We're gonna have
a blast together.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.890
You're not here for fun, Triff.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.993
You're here to do some work.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.962
You ever hear of "manners
maketh man," Officer Reeves?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.698
I skipped class that day.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.666
We met your
demands. Now talk.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.035
Start with what Hicks has done
with Mary Smith.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.505
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.840
But if you were to track down

22:20.873 --> 22:24.677
Hicks's old van
from ten years ago...

22:24.711 --> 22:26.379
FBI seized it
when they arrested him.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.580
Didn't find anything.

22:27.614 --> 22:28.981
Stop thinking
like a cop.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.784
They searched the van.

22:31.818 --> 22:36.823
I'm telling you
to search inside the van.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.967
You mind telling me exactly
what we're looking for?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.002
We'll know it when we find it.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.538
FORNELL:
That's helpful.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.807
Ever occur to you Triff sent us
on a wild goose chase?

22:54.841 --> 22:57.444
FBI scoured this vehicle,
found nothing

22:57.477 --> 23:00.647
to tie Hicks to Lieutenant
O'Connell's murder.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.450
TORRES: I should get hazard
pay. That's for sure.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.986
You know what ten years of dust
will do to my sinuses? Ugh!

23:08.555 --> 23:09.956
You know, my body's a...

23:09.989 --> 23:11.891
My body's a machine, baby.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.993
I can't get it exposed
to the elements.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.995
My machine's gonna be
violently ill

23:16.028 --> 23:17.830
if you keeping talking
about your machine.

23:22.935 --> 23:23.970
Hey, Tobias?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.043
TORRES: Is that an
allergen hallucination,

23:31.077 --> 23:32.879
or is that dry blood?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.715
Please let that be
what I think it is.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.984
ABBY: Hicks's fingerprints
were all over

23:38.017 --> 23:40.553
the pipe that Gibbs found
in the van.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.689
Was the dry blood a match
to Lieutenant O'Connell's?

23:42.722 --> 23:43.956
Uh, yep.

23:43.990 --> 23:47.460
That was one
of five blood profiles I found.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.796
The other four

23:49.829 --> 23:51.664
match the unsolved murder cases

23:51.698 --> 23:53.132
in the D.C.-Virgina area.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.902
Gibbs found the mother
of all murder weapons.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.771
There is no way Hicks can
talk himself out of this.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.807
We got him.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.785
Anything, Bishop?

24:12.819 --> 24:13.486
:
Uh...

24:13.520 --> 24:15.154
No signal from Hicks's phone.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.590
He was a no-show for his shift
at the coffee shop.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.658
Have any word from Torres?

24:18.691 --> 24:19.792
The tracking device
was signaling

24:19.826 --> 24:21.093
from Hicks's apartment,

24:21.127 --> 24:21.961
but he was
long gone.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.062
He left this behind, though.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.130
"Strike three."

24:27.133 --> 24:28.735
He's always one step ahead.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.670
How does he know we're onto him?

24:30.703 --> 24:31.904
BISHOP:
Gibbs?

24:31.938 --> 24:33.740
Hicks's cell
phone is back on.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.141
You got a location?

24:35.174 --> 24:36.909
It's pinging

24:36.943 --> 24:38.945
at Mary Smith's nursing home.

24:42.014 --> 24:46.586
When I saw that man standing
in my doorway,

24:46.619 --> 24:49.021
I was certain
he was gonna kill me.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.890
It was Gabriel Hicks?

24:50.923 --> 24:51.991
He threatened my nephew.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.560
Said he was gonna kill him,

24:53.593 --> 24:54.994
if I didn't go with him.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.295
So I did.
What happened

24:56.328 --> 24:57.697
after Hicks took you
from the home?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.599
He drove to a
wooded area,

24:59.632 --> 25:03.536
tied me up and forced me
into the trunk.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.538
And then?
He left me there.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.640
I don't know for how long.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.075
Then he just
let me go.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.110
How'd you get
Hicks's cell phone?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.779
He gave it to me.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.615
Said to turn it on as soon
as he dropped me off here.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.950
Did Hicks say anything else?

25:17.984 --> 25:23.255
"Those who talk
get what's coming to them."

25:27.059 --> 25:29.128
Yep. All's quiet
over here, Abby.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.264
Nothing to report.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.635
Yeah, McGee's fine.

25:35.668 --> 25:38.738
What's Triff up to?

25:38.771 --> 25:39.906
He's, um, standing by.

25:39.939 --> 25:40.940
What's the latest

25:40.973 --> 25:42.775
on Hicks?
Psst!

25:42.809 --> 25:44.276
Hang on, Abbs.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.978
Hello, Governor.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.580
Can I borrow your phone?

25:47.614 --> 25:49.281
It's my friend's birthday,
and, mm,

25:49.315 --> 25:50.950
I don't want to be rude.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.986
You're doing a pretty good job
of that right now.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.288
Your turn to play psychositter.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.657
REEVES:
Sorry, Abby, I'm back...

25:57.690 --> 25:59.091
He's a sensitive one.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.162
What's that?

26:03.195 --> 26:04.163
Turkey on rye.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.698
I'm a vegetarian.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.700
Are you kidding me?
You used to be a furrier.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.702
Well, wearing animals
is different from eating them.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.804
No, it's not. Wait-- it...
no, if you're a furrier,

26:11.838 --> 26:14.206
then you don't have a...
okay, you know what?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.876
Never mind. Just eat it,
don't eat it, I don't care.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.380
You know,
I'm sensing some frustration,

26:21.413 --> 26:23.716
Agent McGee,
but perhaps,

26:23.750 --> 26:25.685
you might feel
more relaxed around me

26:25.718 --> 26:27.720
if we got to know each other.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.322
You might be surprised
at how much we have in common.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.724
Yeah, like, what?

26:31.758 --> 26:34.393
Well, deep-seated daddy
issues, for example.

26:34.426 --> 26:38.064
My father
was an emotionless workaholic

26:38.097 --> 26:39.632
who never had
time for me.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.067
How about yours?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.769
No comment.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.171
Don't worry.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.708
I'm sure that you're a much
better parent than he ever was.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.977
Excuse me?
You tried to hide
the evidence,

26:51.010 --> 26:55.782
but the pungent scent of spit up
was a dead giveaway.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.251
A boy and a girl.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.020
Mazel tov.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.955
And judging from the bags
beneath your eyes,

27:02.989 --> 27:06.025
I'm assuming that they're
on different sleep schedules?

27:06.058 --> 27:07.359
Must be difficult.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.795
Yeah. You have no idea.

27:08.828 --> 27:09.929
Well.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.664
I'm all ears.

27:11.698 --> 27:15.702
When Johnny is awake, Morgan
is asleep, and vice versa.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.369
I mean, it's like
they're conspiring

27:17.403 --> 27:19.839
to keep Delilah and I
from getting any sleep at all.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.374
And we're doing the bonding
thing as much as possible,

27:22.408 --> 27:24.176
you know, we're-we're doing
the babywearing,

27:24.210 --> 27:26.713
and singing to them
for hours every single day,

27:26.746 --> 27:28.715
but... just doesn't feel
like enough.

27:28.748 --> 27:29.849
Well, it never will.

27:29.882 --> 27:33.853
All you need to do is love them.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.288
Everything else
will work itself out.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.990
You'll see.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.358
Thanks.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.793
Plus, my parents
never bonded with me,

27:40.827 --> 27:42.428
and I turned out just fine.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.030
REEVES:
Thanks, Abbs. Right.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.365
Time to start making yourself
useful, Triff.

27:46.398 --> 27:49.101
Haven't I already helped you
locate Hicks's murder weapon?

27:49.135 --> 27:50.436
You're welcome, by the way.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.804
Hicks is to the wind.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.472
Any ideas where he's headed?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.975
No, but if he should send
a postcard from Zihuatanejo,

27:56.008 --> 27:57.744
I will be sure to let you know.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.946
You mentored Hicks
when you were cellmates.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.782
Did you ever mention
where you'd go if you'd lay low?

28:02.815 --> 28:04.316
Let's see.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.785
By all means,

28:05.818 --> 28:07.053
take your time.
I mean, it's not like

28:07.086 --> 28:08.755
we got a crazed serial killer

28:08.788 --> 28:11.090
on the streets.
You know, nothing comes to mind.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.459
Triff, tell us the truth.

28:13.492 --> 28:14.827
You think
that I would lie to you,

28:14.861 --> 28:17.764
after all
we just shared together?

28:17.797 --> 28:19.799
I wouldn't do that
to my best friend.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.468
Say again?

28:22.501 --> 28:24.837
We're besties, you dolt.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.773
And we don't need
another musketeer,

28:26.806 --> 28:28.707
so why don't you go
get me something to eat?

28:33.345 --> 28:35.481
SLOANE:
Yikes. I know that face.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.416
What's on your mind?
Hicks.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.185
Things aren't adding up.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.820
I thought the same thing.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.922
That's why I called in a favor
and got a copy

28:42.955 --> 28:44.791
of his juvenile records.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.192
A psych eval done
when he was a kid suggests

28:46.225 --> 28:48.527
that he suffered from abuse
at the hands of his father.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.496
Yeah

28:50.529 --> 28:53.866
It explains why all of his
victims fit the same profile.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.802
They're all males,
in their 30s,

28:55.835 --> 28:57.804
strong builds,
in positions of authority.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.505
Men who remind him
of his father.

28:59.538 --> 29:00.840
Killing them
was Hicks's way of gaining

29:00.873 --> 29:02.875
the control
he desperately craves.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.511
Yeah, except Jessica Shaeffer
doesn't fit that mold.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.014
Precisely what worries me.

29:08.047 --> 29:12.852
Gibbs, his entire profile
has-has completely shifted.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.054
He's killing
with an agenda now,

29:15.087 --> 29:16.889
which makes him
even more dangerous.

29:16.923 --> 29:17.723
Then why not kill Mary Smith?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.058
It's not like
he's suddenly grown

29:19.091 --> 29:20.559
a-a conscience.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.028
Hicks is smart.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.896
There is a reason
for everything he does.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.297
Hicks knew we were tracking him.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.533
Right.

29:27.566 --> 29:28.534
That's why he ditched his coat.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.103
It's why he gave his cell phone
to Mary Smith.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.872
He wanted us to go there
and question her.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.140
But for what purpose?

29:34.173 --> 29:35.774
To split us up.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.410
How long has
Fornell been gone?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.847
He went back to his office when
you left for the nursing home.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.982
He said he wanted to look
through his files on Hicks.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.024
It looks like
they finally caught on.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.928
After all the chances
I gave you,

29:55.962 --> 29:57.496
you still couldn't catch me.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.567
You know what comes after
strike three, don't you?

30:01.600 --> 30:02.869
Strike four?

30:03.635 --> 30:07.406
Sorry, I'm not really
a sports guy.

30:09.308 --> 30:14.113
Oh, I've been looking forward
to this for the last ten years.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.449
And here we finally are.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.618
Is there anything
you want to say?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.620
Yeah.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.489
You're weaker than I expected.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.025
I give you credit

30:26.058 --> 30:28.160
for not falling for the act
like everyone else did.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.598
It's too bad
you couldn't do your job,

30:32.631 --> 30:34.266
keep me locked up.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.968
Well, you'll be back there soon.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.603
Or six feet under,
I'm not picky.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.305
It's a shame
no one listened to you.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.875
Jessica might
still be alive,

30:42.909 --> 30:45.011
and countless others
yet to come.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.879
Including you.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.881
Don't get emotional on me.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.583
Let me guess, right now,
you're trying to stall

30:51.617 --> 30:53.552
so you can think
of a way out of this.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.887
I was wondering how much longer

30:54.921 --> 30:56.923
I'd have to listen
to you babble.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.992
You're worse than my ex-wife,
and she was good-looking.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.262
Do me a favor,
swing the damn bat.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.968
Did you think
you were getting off that easy?

31:09.001 --> 31:11.303
No, I'm not killing you
just yet.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.940
Two birds,

31:13.973 --> 31:15.975
one stone.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.223
NCIS!

31:33.259 --> 31:35.161
Clear house.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.296
No Fornell.
BISHOP:
Well,

31:37.329 --> 31:39.131
he left his Taser and what's
left of his cell phone.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.299
It might not be that bad.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.268
Maybe he went out to dinner.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.373
After he tied himself up?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.942
Just trying to stay positive.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.244
Um... Gibbs?

31:52.278 --> 31:53.645
It's Fornell's license,

31:53.679 --> 31:55.281
with the same calling card

31:55.314 --> 31:57.183
Hicks used on his
previous victims.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.320
All right. Less positive now.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.575
Hey, I do not
feel right about this.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.277
What? Just go. I'll be fine.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.745
Fornell needs your
help more than I do.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.981
Besides, Triff's been
surprisingly cooperative.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.316
Right. That's what
makes me nervous.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.153
Hurry back.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.454
Right.

32:39.225 --> 32:44.030
Finally. I thought
he'd never leave.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.265
Three's a crowd, as they say.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.500
They also say
"safety in numbers."

32:48.534 --> 32:50.102
Well, you still don't trust me,
Agent McGee,

32:50.136 --> 32:51.337
and that hurts my feelings.

32:51.370 --> 32:54.173
Your deal with NCIS was
to help us arrest Hicks.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.408
No.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.211
I said that I would
help you stop him.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.180
It's the same thing.
Did you really think

33:01.213 --> 33:03.749
that a wild animal
would willingly return

33:03.782 --> 33:07.319
to his cage
after tasting freedom?

33:07.353 --> 33:11.290
You have no idea
what you're up against.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.792
We talking about Hicks or you?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.362
Now you're catching on.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.235
Hey, anything on Fornell?

33:23.269 --> 33:25.304
No, not yet. Gibbs and
Torres are hitting up

33:25.337 --> 33:26.738
every place Hicks has ties to.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.607
What can I do?
You can help me
sift through

33:28.640 --> 33:31.343
the city's traffic cams
for any sign

33:31.377 --> 33:32.444
of Hicks'
stolen sedan.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.281
On it.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.282
Bishop.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.084
Where?

33:38.117 --> 33:40.719
Yeah, on our way.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.322
BOLO hit on the sedan.
Where?

33:43.355 --> 33:46.125
Parked outside
McGee's apartment.
Triff.

33:49.395 --> 33:52.198
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I adhere to a very rigid

33:52.231 --> 33:55.401
meal schedule, and if
I don't eat soon, well,

33:55.434 --> 33:57.469
I might just get
a little agitated.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.207
If that's James Bond,

34:01.240 --> 34:03.342
tell him to get me
some tofu ramen

34:03.375 --> 34:04.476
from the shop around the corner.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.512
I got to get out
of this apartment.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.380
You're not going anywhere.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.521
You should know better.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.291
Don't do anything stupid.

34:19.325 --> 34:20.359
Turn around.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.566
Move.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.405
Still don't think
three's a crowd?

34:35.674 --> 34:38.810
Been a long time, Triff.
You surprised to see me?

34:38.844 --> 34:41.347
I mean, I figured
you'd show up eventually.

34:41.380 --> 34:45.217
Although, it took way
longer than I expected.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.785
I guess you're still
not as smart as me.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.121
Yet I'm not the one
trapped in a cell.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.657
You see, this is
only temporary.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.626
But while you're here,

34:54.660 --> 34:57.429
why not help out your mentor
for old times' sake?

34:57.463 --> 34:58.697
You want me to help you
when you've been

34:58.730 --> 35:00.332
running your mouth to NCIS?

35:00.366 --> 35:03.169
Think of it as me teaching you
a valuable life lesson.

35:03.202 --> 35:06.805
And now you know never
to confide in a fellow convict.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.375
Of course, someone
with some common sense

35:09.408 --> 35:10.342
would've known
that already.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.443
Lesson learned.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.679
You want to die? Stop talking.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.815
Truth is, you should be
on your knees thanking me

35:16.848 --> 35:19.451
for taking you under my wing
all those years ago.

35:19.485 --> 35:23.889
Even then I could see
how weak you were.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.358
That's why I took pity on you.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.659
Yeah, we're gonna die.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.896
I now realize what
a waste of time that was.

35:30.929 --> 35:35.434
You are disappointingly
inadequate,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.469
as usual.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.505
Is that right?

35:41.207 --> 35:44.243
I didn't know what
I was gonna do when I saw you,

35:44.276 --> 35:45.911
but you've swayed my decision.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.780
How does it
feel to know

35:48.814 --> 35:50.449
that you've just
signed your own...

35:53.485 --> 35:54.920
TRIFF: Get down!

35:58.457 --> 36:00.892
He got me.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.562
I'm hit. Man down.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.297
Ow.
You're okay, you're okay.

36:05.331 --> 36:08.334
You'll be fine.
How long was that door unlocked?

36:08.367 --> 36:11.570
Go get a towel before the blood
stains my hardwoods.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.739
Is that really important
right now?

36:13.772 --> 36:15.741
It's 200-year-old French oak.
Just do it.

36:15.774 --> 36:16.975
Oh!

36:17.008 --> 36:18.644
You shot up my wall!

36:20.846 --> 36:23.415
Hicks. Freeze!

36:24.383 --> 36:25.617
TORRES:
Gun!

36:25.651 --> 36:27.686
Everybody move! Get down!

36:27.719 --> 36:28.887
Get out of our way! Move!
Everybody get down!

36:36.895 --> 36:37.996
Check on McGee.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.266
Copy.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.601
Who's the weak one now, huh?

38:33.779 --> 38:36.515
You sure took your sweet time.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.585
I kind of like this thing.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.854
It's the newest model.

38:45.123 --> 38:48.326
Somebody broke my old one.

38:52.398 --> 38:54.766
Honey, I promise,
it's safe to come home.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.503
The case is over
and Triff is gone.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.804
What?

38:58.837 --> 39:00.672
No, there's nothing else
I need to tell you.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.674
All right.

39:02.708 --> 39:05.444
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Love you, too. Bye.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.380
How'd I do?

39:08.414 --> 39:09.881
Totally believable.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.017
You're getting so much better
at lying. I'm so proud.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.619
I don't know,
it feels weird, though.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.053
Maybe I should just
tell Delilah what happened.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.388
About almost getting shot

39:16.422 --> 39:17.623
and owing your life to Triff?

39:17.656 --> 39:19.725
Yeah, I'd keep that
to myself, buddy.

39:19.758 --> 39:20.726
Me, too.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.594
Me, three.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.031
The prison van is here
to take him back

39:26.064 --> 39:28.133
to Maryland Correctional.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.136
Oh, I was so hoping to meet
the missus and the little ones.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.538
Oh, well.

39:32.571 --> 39:33.605
Next time.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.742
This may sound strange,
but, uh...

39:37.676 --> 39:39.745
...we appreciate your
helping out on the case.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.813
I knew I could get
something out of it.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.582
You got Hicks,

39:43.615 --> 39:45.817
and I got two days
out of prison.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.754
And boy, am I feeling
reinvigorated.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.522
You got shot.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.758
It's still not the worst
vacation I've ever had.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.193
Triff, why'd you take
that bullet for me?
Please.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.696
What are best friends for?
BISHOP: I'm sorry.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.164
Wh

39:59.197 --> 40:00.699
Plus, if you die,
someone new

40:00.732 --> 40:02.434
would move into
my apartment.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.202
I can't risk some
gauche millennial

40:04.235 --> 40:07.706
hanging movie posters
on my Venetian plaster.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.577
Oh, no, not after
all the blood, sweat,

40:11.610 --> 40:13.679
and tears that I put
into our place.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.947
Look, seriously,
you saved my life.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.584
So I-I feel like
I just want to say...

40:18.617 --> 40:20.018
I'm gonna stop
you right there.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.020
I know what you're going
to ask, and the answer is yes.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.122
I would love to be
godfather to the twins.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.024
What? No.
No, that's not at all...

40:26.057 --> 40:27.959
We're family now,
Timothy.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.962
And no one goes against
the family.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.499
Uh...

40:33.532 --> 40:37.703
As heartwarming as this is,
it's time to go, Triff.

40:37.736 --> 40:41.172
Bye-bye.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.742
Until next time.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.579
What just happened?

40:47.613 --> 40:49.815
Brah, please
let me be there

40:49.848 --> 40:51.483
when you tell Delilah
the good news.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.489
You know, I could help you
spruce this place up,

40:57.523 --> 40:59.057
like I did my garage.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.727
4K TV on that wall
would look great.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.894
Already got a TV.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.599
I'll alert the Smithsonian.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.503
Returning the Hicks files.

41:11.537 --> 41:13.739
That the only reason
you're here?

41:13.772 --> 41:15.807
Maybe I wanted
to see my friend.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.077
Fine.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.746
I wanted to thank you.

41:20.779 --> 41:23.715
Not just for catching Hicks,

41:23.749 --> 41:26.151
but for correcting the mistake
I made ten years ago.

41:26.184 --> 41:30.856
Tobias, I made
plenty of them myself.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.258
That is true.

41:33.291 --> 41:36.127
I'm just glad Hicks
is back where he belongs.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.096
I hear the Bureau's
considering reinstating you.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.899
Yeah.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.737
I told them,
"Thanks, but no thanks."

41:45.771 --> 41:48.506
Kind of like
being my own boss.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.978
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

41:53.011 --> 41:54.980
I didn't say that.
You didn't say anything.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.982
I know what that means
in Gibbs-speak.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.317
Your life.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.752
Do what makes you happy.

42:00.786 --> 42:04.055
Got room for a partner
if you're interested.

42:05.657 --> 42:08.894
Tobias Fornell and Associate
Private Investigations
