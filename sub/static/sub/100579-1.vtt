01:32.467 --> 01:34.034
Jeremy is leaving!

01:34.036 --> 01:36.505
- Hey, bud.
- Jeremy is leaving!

01:39.075 --> 01:42.009
Hey, not my head... phones, Josh.

01:42.011 --> 01:43.643
Jeremy is leaving!

01:43.645 --> 01:45.478
- What's with him today?
- I don't know.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.481
Have you seen my shoes?

01:47.683 --> 01:49.018
- He has my shoes?
- Yes.

01:49.852 --> 01:50.953
Josh!

02:09.972 --> 02:12.405
- Josh!
- Jeremy is leaving!

02:12.407 --> 02:13.606
We know. Stop!

02:13.608 --> 02:15.109
Jared, stop chasing
your brother!

02:15.111 --> 02:16.877
- Give me my shoes.
- Jeremy is leaving!

02:16.879 --> 02:19.680
Tom. Do something!

02:19.682 --> 02:20.981
Jared, stop chasing
your brother.

02:20.983 --> 02:22.049
Jeremy is leaving.

02:22.051 --> 02:24.018
That... That's it? Really?

02:24.020 --> 02:26.153
- Jeremy is leaving.
- We know. Stop.

02:26.155 --> 02:28.090
Come on, dude.
Give me a minute.

02:29.424 --> 02:31.391
Sit down, buddy.

02:31.393 --> 02:32.793
Give me the shoes.

02:32.795 --> 02:33.863
Here's your shoes.

02:35.798 --> 02:37.497
Listen.

02:37.499 --> 02:40.167
I know, I'm leaving,

02:40.169 --> 02:41.769
and you're upset and you
don't know what to do.

02:41.771 --> 02:42.805
So just take
a deep breath, okay?

02:44.606 --> 02:46.341
Jeremy is leaving.

02:47.076 --> 02:48.742
I know.

02:48.744 --> 02:50.545
Here. Listen to this.

02:51.580 --> 02:52.980
This is gonna
cheer you up.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.616
Just like the show, right?

02:56.618 --> 02:57.787
Watch this.

02:59.121 --> 03:00.587
"Kirk to <i>Enterprise."</i>

03:00.589 --> 03:01.889
You try it.

03:01.891 --> 03:04.024
"Kirk to <i>Enterprise.</i>
Hello?"

03:04.026 --> 03:05.558
Listen,
I'm leaving for a while,

03:05.560 --> 03:07.194
but I want you
to have this, okay?

03:07.196 --> 03:09.930
And I promise you
I'm right on the other side.

03:09.932 --> 03:11.198
But that's your phone.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.934
I'll get another one.
New life, new phone.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.637
- Sweet.
- It's yours, buddy.

03:16.504 --> 03:18.005
I love you, okay?

03:18.007 --> 03:19.106
Okay, come on.

03:19.108 --> 03:20.540
Here we go. Let's do it.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.743
- Let's go.
- Come on.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.479
- Thanks, Dad.
- You got it.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.482
- Jeremy.
- Yeah?

03:31.553 --> 03:33.555
Are you sure you don't
wanna take the old guitar?

03:35.157 --> 03:36.458
Dad, it's yours.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.025
Yeah, I know,

03:38.027 --> 03:40.694
but you play it ten
times more than I do.

03:40.696 --> 03:42.029
Dad, I'm not
taking your guitar.

03:42.031 --> 03:43.498
That's your story.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.638
Let's get you to college.

03:59.081 --> 04:00.147
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

04:00.149 --> 04:01.650
I love you, son.

04:02.685 --> 04:04.118
Be good.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.185
Okay, son.

04:05.187 --> 04:07.821
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you.

04:07.823 --> 04:08.923
See you soon.

04:08.925 --> 04:10.124
Hey. Love you guys.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.827
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Love you.

04:13.229 --> 04:14.496
Jeremy.

04:16.531 --> 04:17.532
Come here.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.642
No way.

04:29.544 --> 04:30.878
It's a gift
from all of us.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.214
How did you afford this?

04:33.683 --> 04:34.848
They took out a loan.

04:34.850 --> 04:37.051
And we all agreed to no
Christmas gifts this year.

04:37.053 --> 04:38.518
We worked it out.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.553
- Sure.
- Yeah.

04:40.555 --> 04:42.890
You gotta go.

04:42.892 --> 04:45.094
For me,
music is a hobby.

04:45.695 --> 04:46.929
For you,

04:48.731 --> 04:49.799
it's a gift.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.568
So, go write your story.

04:55.705 --> 04:56.770
Go on.

04:56.772 --> 04:58.038
Hurry up.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.048
What would you have done
if he took your old guitar?

05:08.884 --> 05:10.851
Well, I...

05:10.853 --> 05:12.953
I would've kept that one.

06:48.751 --> 06:49.919
Thank you so much.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.026
Thanks. Thank you.

07:11.173 --> 07:13.006
Welcome
to Calvary Chapel College.

07:13.008 --> 07:14.241
Not a bad front yard, huh?

07:14.243 --> 07:15.978
Not bad at all.

07:27.923 --> 07:29.091
- Hi.
- What's up?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.068
Wait up!

07:55.217 --> 07:56.250
Hold up.

07:56.252 --> 07:57.851
Hey, man.
Uh, Norm sent me to help load in.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.019
- Norm did?
- Yeah.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.723
Okay.
Wait, who's Norm?

08:21.944 --> 08:23.345
Hey, man.
You're Jean-Luc, right?

08:24.280 --> 08:26.914
Yeah. Are you in the crew?

08:26.916 --> 08:29.049
Jeremy. I'm Jeremy.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.784
I'm, uh...
I'm a student here.

08:30.786 --> 08:32.788
I'm a freshman. I'm new.
I play the guitar.

08:33.155 --> 08:35.155
Uh, cool.

08:35.157 --> 08:36.190
Dude, I love your music.

08:36.192 --> 08:37.958
You're, like, the reason
I came to school here.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.894
- You're a legend.
- Oh, don't know about that.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.263
Uh, anyway,
I was wondering, if, uh,

08:43.265 --> 08:46.300
I could ask you some questions
sometime about music?

08:46.302 --> 08:48.037
The industry,
how to make it?

08:49.471 --> 08:50.472
"Make it?"

08:51.273 --> 08:52.274
Yeah.

08:53.876 --> 08:54.942
You're asking
the wrong question.

08:54.944 --> 08:56.877
It's not about making it.

08:56.879 --> 09:00.316
It's about whatever our
songs give people. You know?

09:01.450 --> 09:02.885
So, what do you wanna
give people?

09:04.420 --> 09:06.155
- Figure that out first.
- Yeah.

09:07.489 --> 09:09.158
Nice to meet you, man.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.328
Hey.

09:14.330 --> 09:15.831
Yes? Yes?

09:17.533 --> 09:19.235
Do you know
how to tune a guitar?

09:21.036 --> 09:22.738
Yeah.

09:23.572 --> 09:24.940
Half a step down.

10:23.932 --> 10:24.998

11:05.207 --> 11:06.373
"Melissa."

11:06.375 --> 11:07.576
Yep.

11:08.444 --> 11:10.110
I saw you tonight.

11:10.112 --> 11:12.446
I mean, I was watching you.
"Watching?"

11:13.515 --> 11:15.050
Watched you.

11:16.185 --> 11:17.319
You were watching me?

11:19.321 --> 11:20.422
Okay.

11:21.523 --> 11:23.256
- Okay.
- Melissa.

11:23.258 --> 11:24.259
I gotta go.

11:25.194 --> 11:26.259
Bye.

11:26.261 --> 11:28.328
- Well, I sing too.
- Hmm?

11:28.330 --> 11:30.499
I sing.
I saw you singing.

11:31.367 --> 11:32.368
Nice.

11:34.937 --> 11:35.938
Bye.

<i>A record deal</i>

11:45.381 --> 11:47.114
two years after
you graduated here.

11:47.116 --> 11:49.182
How?

11:49.184 --> 11:51.218
I just kept
writing songs, man.

11:51.220 --> 11:52.285
It's all about
the songs.

11:52.287 --> 11:55.455
Write what you care about,
what you're afraid of.

11:55.457 --> 11:58.959
Whatever it is,
it needs to be truth.

11:58.961 --> 12:00.562
Is that what you write about?
The truth?

12:02.030 --> 12:04.633
Brother, I write
love songs, to God.

12:06.001 --> 12:07.702
Mostly to God.

12:07.704 --> 12:09.369
Sometimes to a girl.

12:09.371 --> 12:10.705
I'm writing one
right now for a girl,

12:10.707 --> 12:12.641
and this girl, man,
she is...

12:14.443 --> 12:17.077
So, yeah.

12:17.079 --> 12:19.513
Write what you love, yeah?
Get after it.

12:19.515 --> 12:21.415
Hasten the day.

12:21.417 --> 12:22.518
What does that mean?

12:24.186 --> 12:26.286
You know, a day
with no more pain,

12:26.288 --> 12:29.358
no suffering,
every tear wiped away.

12:32.394 --> 12:35.228
Our music
pulls that closer.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.298
So...

12:37.633 --> 12:39.001
Hasten the day.

So, you actually do sing.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.392
And?

13:05.394 --> 13:06.493
And...

13:06.495 --> 13:10.999
I have pretty high standards
when it comes to music,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.368
but it's good.

13:15.070 --> 13:16.436
Like, very good, or...

13:16.438 --> 13:18.205
Yeah, pretty good.

13:18.207 --> 13:20.106
Oh, just "pretty good."

13:20.108 --> 13:22.044
Yeah, pretty good.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.179
Do you write
your own songs?

13:25.080 --> 13:26.546
I'm working
on some stuff.

13:26.548 --> 13:27.715
Can I hear it?

13:27.717 --> 13:29.349
- Can you hear it?
- Yeah.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.151
Sure, if I can read
your journal.

13:31.153 --> 13:33.055
What? No.

13:35.090 --> 13:37.226
- I should get to class.
- Yeah.

13:38.060 --> 13:40.193
You keep singing, Jeremy.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.095
- Camp.
- Hmm?

13:42.097 --> 13:45.499
- Jeremy Camp is my full name.
- Okay.

13:45.501 --> 13:46.736
Jeremy Camp.

13:49.338 --> 13:51.071
Hey, what are you
doing tonight?

13:51.073 --> 13:52.539
Tonight?
Oh, that depends.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.307
There's lots of stuff
I could be doing, really.

13:54.309 --> 13:55.408
A lot of things.

13:55.410 --> 13:59.546
Oh, okay. Well, if you
find yourself free at 8:00,

13:59.548 --> 14:01.481
I'll be at the beach,
Oceanside Pier.

14:01.483 --> 14:04.084
You know, stop on by.

14:04.086 --> 14:05.151
It's a date.

14:05.153 --> 14:06.486
What? No.

14:06.488 --> 14:09.322
It's not a date.

14:09.324 --> 14:10.791
Really? Because you
literally just asked me out

14:10.793 --> 14:12.492
just right over here.

14:12.494 --> 14:13.730
We'll see.

14:16.098 --> 14:19.232
Oh, yeah, and you should, um,
bring your guitar as well.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.701
Okay.

14:20.703 --> 14:22.737
- It's a date.
- Not a date!

14:22.739 --> 14:23.806
Not.

14:25.541 --> 14:26.709
It's a date.

14:29.511 --> 14:30.680
It's definitely a date.

14:47.362 --> 14:48.428
Oh, hey.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.198
- Hi! You showed up.
- Hey.

14:51.533 --> 14:54.601
See?
Told you it wasn't a date.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.669
Yeah.

14:55.671 --> 14:57.504
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Hey, man.

14:57.506 --> 15:00.140
Uh, you guys...
I didn't know you guys were friends.

15:00.142 --> 15:01.608
Oh, yeah.
He's my best friend.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.778
No, you just
keep taking my food.

15:03.780 --> 15:06.613
Well, why won't
you share these?

15:06.615 --> 15:08.648
How long have you,
uh, been friends for?

15:08.650 --> 15:10.350
Oh, um...

15:10.352 --> 15:13.253
Like, freshman year.
I was working at Sunset Point.

15:13.255 --> 15:14.454
Right,
at the restaurant.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.756
- Mmm-hmm.
- And then we kind of started

15:15.758 --> 15:17.692
this, uh, tradition,
I guess, here.

15:17.694 --> 15:19.292
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, actually, though,

15:19.294 --> 15:21.394
you were truly
my running partner

15:21.396 --> 15:23.496
- for my first year at school.
- Well, not by choice.

15:23.498 --> 15:25.165
And then he decided
to become a rock star

15:25.167 --> 15:26.333
and get lazy on me.

15:26.335 --> 15:27.603
Yeah. Here we are.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.206
You brought your guitar.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.342
I did. Well,
you asked me to.

15:35.344 --> 15:36.877
Right, right. I did.

15:36.879 --> 15:40.347
Maybe you should, um,
start us off with a song.

15:40.349 --> 15:41.949
We always start off with
a song, so it would be nice...

15:41.951 --> 15:42.984
Oh, no. I'm not...

15:42.986 --> 15:43.985
No. Let's hear
what you got. Come on.

15:43.987 --> 15:46.453
Hey, you guys, this is Jeremy Camp.
Right?

15:47.522 --> 15:49.255
And he's going to, uh,
sing for us.

15:49.257 --> 15:50.758
Except, no,
I'm not going to.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.528
Please? Come on.
Do you have a song that you like?

15:54.931 --> 15:57.631
All right.
I guess I'm playing a song.

15:59.702 --> 16:01.201
Uh, <i>Find Me In The River?</i>

16:01.203 --> 16:03.171
Yeah. I love that song.

16:03.873 --> 16:04.874
All right.

16:10.412 --> 16:12.414
<i>♪ Find me in the river</i>

16:16.585 --> 16:19.856
<i>♪ Find me on my knees</i>

16:22.491 --> 16:24.894
<i>♪ I've walked
Against the water</i>

16:28.363 --> 16:31.233
<i>♪ Now I'm waiting if you please</i>

16:34.704 --> 16:37.606
<i>♪ We've longed

16:40.777 --> 16:43.680
<i>♪ But never

16:46.983 --> 16:49.786
<i>♪ And bought our pretty crowns</i>

16:52.654 --> 16:55.624
<i>♪ But never paid the price</i>

16:59.261 --> 17:01.661
<i>♪ We didn't count on suffering</i>

17:04.867 --> 17:07.770
<i>♪ We didn't count on pain</i>

17:10.740 --> 17:13.776
<i>♪ But if the blessing's
In the valley</i>

17:16.913 --> 17:19.949
<i>♪ Then in the river I will wait</i>

17:24.653 --> 17:27.620
<i>♪ Find me in the river</i>

17:27.622 --> 17:30.657
<i>♪ Find me there</i>

17:30.659 --> 17:36.864
<i>♪ Find me on my knees
With my soul laid bare</i>

17:36.866 --> 17:42.870
<i>♪ Even though You're gone

17:42.872 --> 17:45.574
<i>♪ Find me in the river</i>

<i>♪ I'm waiting here for you</i>

17:53.348 --> 17:55.785
<i>♪ I'm waiting here for you</i>

17:59.488 --> 18:02.457
<i>♪ I'm waiting here for you</i>

18:10.800 --> 18:12.434
So nice.

18:24.747 --> 18:26.947
- Whoo. Hey. What are you...
- Hey. What are you...

18:26.949 --> 18:28.082
What are you doing here?

18:28.084 --> 18:31.486
This is where I walk
every morning.

18:32.354 --> 18:33.453
Uh...

18:33.455 --> 18:36.422
Huh. But, how did...
What did...

18:36.424 --> 18:37.657
Nice view.

18:37.659 --> 18:40.360
Well, yeah.
It is really nice.

18:40.362 --> 18:42.797
This is, like,
my favorite place to run.

18:42.799 --> 18:44.566
Do you wanna join?

18:46.135 --> 18:47.500
Run?

18:47.502 --> 18:48.568
Yeah.

18:48.570 --> 18:49.804
I'm not really dressed.

18:49.806 --> 18:52.507
Okay. Well,
bet I could beat you.

18:53.608 --> 18:55.142
I bet you couldn't.

18:55.144 --> 18:56.444
Yeah?

18:57.379 --> 18:58.913
Better give it
a try, then.

18:58.915 --> 18:59.980
I'm not running.

18:59.982 --> 19:01.717
Better run. Fast!

19:05.554 --> 19:07.554
You're huffing pretty hard
back there.

19:07.556 --> 19:09.558
I'm fine.

19:12.695 --> 19:14.128
<i>Hey, can I
ask you something?</i>

19:14.130 --> 19:15.562
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:15.564 --> 19:18.464
What's the deal
with you and Jean-Luc?

19:18.466 --> 19:21.501
You guys,
like, a thing? Or...

19:21.503 --> 19:22.569
Oh.

19:22.571 --> 19:24.138
It's, um...

19:26.408 --> 19:27.607
It's complicated.

19:27.609 --> 19:28.508
How so?

19:28.510 --> 19:31.611
He was my first friend
here, actually.

19:31.613 --> 19:36.018
But, uh, I think this year,
his feelings for me, um,

19:37.720 --> 19:38.886
have changed.

19:38.888 --> 19:42.690
And I never felt that way
about him, so...

19:42.692 --> 19:45.460
So, uh,
what do you feel about me?

20:02.078 --> 20:03.746
- This is last night?
- Yeah.

20:04.780 --> 20:05.846
You want me
to play it for you,

20:05.848 --> 20:06.981
give you a feel
for the tempo?

20:06.983 --> 20:08.916
No. It's about
the words.

20:08.918 --> 20:11.685
- Is there a bridge?
- Yeah. It's...

20:14.623 --> 20:17.960
<i>♪ So you will call
And I will answer</i>

20:18.928 --> 20:20.928
<i>♪ Yeah</i>

20:20.930 --> 20:24.566
<i>♪ I hold you
All through the night</i>

20:24.967 --> 20:26.566
<i>♪ Yeah</i>

20:26.568 --> 20:30.873
<i>♪ Yeah, you will make it
All right</i>

20:32.507 --> 20:34.474
<i>♪ Yeah</i>

20:34.476 --> 20:38.012
<i>♪ And I will guard you
Through the night ♪</i>

20:43.585 --> 20:45.686
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:45.688 --> 20:47.154
<i>Since we're all having
such a great time,</i>

20:47.156 --> 20:49.158
<i>I'd like to do something
a little different.</i>

20:50.525 --> 20:52.793
<i>I have a new friend,</i>

20:52.795 --> 20:56.697
<i>and this friend wrote a song
that I think is pretty good.</i>

20:56.699 --> 20:58.933
<i>And I'd like to bring him out
so he can sing it right now.</i>

20:58.935 --> 21:03.569
<i>So please welcome
my friend, Jeremy Camp!</i>

21:05.507 --> 21:06.941
- I'm not gonna...
- Go!

21:06.943 --> 21:09.679
- I'm not gonna... Melissa!
- Oh, my God, go. Go, go, go!

21:21.958 --> 21:23.757
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

21:26.963 --> 21:29.832
<i>This is kind of,
uh, unexpected. Um...</i>

21:33.668 --> 21:35.670
<i>This song is basically
just, um,</i>

21:36.839 --> 21:40.040
<i>just a bunch of questions
that I have.</i>

21:42.845 --> 21:44.512
<i>So...</i>

22:02.898 --> 22:06.867
<i>♪ In only a moment
Truth was seen</i>

22:06.869 --> 22:09.303
<i>♪ Revealed this mystery</i>

22:09.305 --> 22:13.976
<i>♪ The crown that showed
No dignity, He wore</i>

22:15.845 --> 22:19.246
<i>♪ And the King was placed</i>

22:19.248 --> 22:22.582
<i>♪ For all the world
To show disgrace</i>

22:22.584 --> 22:28.057
<i>♪ But only beauty flowed
From this place</i>

22:30.159 --> 22:33.829
<i>♪ Would you take the place
Of this man?</i>

22:36.832 --> 22:41.003
<i>♪ Would you take the nails
From His hands?</i>

22:43.605 --> 22:47.243
<i>♪ Would you take the place
Of this man?</i>

22:50.146 --> 22:53.849
<i>♪ Would you take the nails
From His hands?</i>

22:54.316 --> 22:55.885
<i>♪ Oh, oh</i>

22:59.155 --> 23:00.723
<i>♪ Yeah</i>

23:01.891 --> 23:04.060
<i>♪ Oh</i>

23:05.361 --> 23:06.727
<i>♪ Yeah</i>

23:10.166 --> 23:13.836
<i>♪ Would you take the place
Of this man?</i>

23:16.772 --> 23:20.676
<i>♪ Would you take the nails
From His hands?</i>

23:23.412 --> 23:27.883
<i>♪ Would you take the place

23:30.152 --> 23:33.655
<i>♪ Would you take the nails

23:35.091 --> 23:36.690
<i>♪ Oh, yeah</i>

23:45.301 --> 23:48.135
<i>You were
really amazing tonight.</i>

23:48.137 --> 23:49.870
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:49.872 --> 23:51.673
So, does this answer
my question?

23:52.174 --> 23:53.175
What?

23:55.077 --> 23:58.011
You are a piece of work,
you know that?

23:58.013 --> 23:59.079
And?

23:59.081 --> 24:01.215
And I made a promise

24:01.217 --> 24:03.250
that I wouldn't get
distracted this year.

24:03.252 --> 24:06.687
And you're very
distracting, potentially.

24:06.689 --> 24:08.122
A promise to who?

24:08.124 --> 24:09.323
God.

24:09.325 --> 24:13.093
And my sister,
but mostly God.

24:13.095 --> 24:15.696
Actually,
it's pretty equal between the two of them.

24:15.698 --> 24:17.032
You should
meet my sister.

24:18.033 --> 24:19.835
So, I understand you now.

24:21.470 --> 24:23.403
What?

24:23.405 --> 24:25.372
You don't like
to disappoint people.

24:25.374 --> 24:27.176
That's not true.

24:28.144 --> 24:30.045
Okay, it's sometimes...

24:30.913 --> 24:32.114
Okay, it's true.

24:33.115 --> 24:34.649
This is about
Jean-Luc.

24:36.719 --> 24:37.853
I can't. I...

24:40.189 --> 24:41.857
I really
don't wanna hurt him.

24:44.326 --> 24:47.794
So, yeah.
That's why I should just

24:47.796 --> 24:48.931
never look at you again.

24:49.965 --> 24:50.966
Melissa.

24:53.002 --> 24:54.003
Okay.

24:55.037 --> 24:56.805
Permission
to speak freely?

24:57.339 --> 24:58.340
Okay.

24:59.475 --> 25:01.243
What if this is destiny?

25:02.511 --> 25:04.978
What if we were
supposed to meet

25:04.980 --> 25:07.047
and we were supposed to feel
this way about each other,

25:07.049 --> 25:09.385
and God wants us to run towards
it, not away from it?

25:11.287 --> 25:13.355
I think we wouldn't
wanna miss that, right?

25:20.996 --> 25:22.398
Just promise me
you'll think about it.

25:42.051 --> 25:43.317
Raj.

25:46.021 --> 25:48.021
Sleeping.

25:49.325 --> 25:50.492
Yeah?

25:52.361 --> 25:53.395
Hi.

25:54.463 --> 25:55.529
Okay.

25:55.531 --> 25:56.732
Oh.

26:01.036 --> 26:02.238
Hey.

26:04.206 --> 26:06.041
I thought about it.

26:06.809 --> 26:08.410
All night, actually.

26:09.912 --> 26:11.080
And okay.

26:11.981 --> 26:13.048
"Okay?"

26:14.516 --> 26:15.983
Yes.

26:15.985 --> 26:17.551
Okay.

26:17.553 --> 26:19.152
One date.

26:19.154 --> 26:20.322
Oh.

26:22.524 --> 26:24.891
Yep. Okay, yeah.
All right.

26:24.893 --> 26:27.427
I mean, okay.

26:27.429 --> 26:29.331
Cool.
Okay.

26:36.572 --> 26:37.973
Yes!

26:42.244 --> 26:45.547
It should be starting
pretty soon.

26:47.416 --> 26:50.083
Here we are.

26:50.085 --> 26:53.253
This was always my favorite
room when I was a little girl.

26:53.255 --> 26:55.355
You grow up
around here?

26:55.357 --> 26:56.358
Mostly.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.560
What do you wanna do
when you graduate?

27:02.498 --> 27:04.231
Everything.

27:04.233 --> 27:06.533
All of it,
you know?

27:06.535 --> 27:08.268
But apparently,

27:08.270 --> 27:10.270
I'm supposed to choose
just one thing,

27:10.272 --> 27:13.040
and I can't
seem to do that.

27:13.042 --> 27:15.044
So, that's why
I like to come here.

27:16.412 --> 27:18.345
The stars always
seem to help.

27:21.116 --> 27:22.182
Enjoy the show.

27:22.184 --> 27:24.053
It's starting.

27:28.657 --> 27:29.658
Wow.

27:33.529 --> 27:34.963
Mmm-hmm.

27:40.336 --> 27:42.037
I love them.

27:45.374 --> 27:48.208
My dad used to take
us sailing a lot,

27:48.210 --> 27:50.310
and you have
not seen stars

27:50.312 --> 27:52.314
until you've seen them
on the open ocean.

27:57.419 --> 27:58.454
Mmm.

28:00.456 --> 28:02.458
Do you see that
right there?

28:04.560 --> 28:06.028
That little blob of light?

28:07.196 --> 28:09.998
That's right,
the little blob of light.

28:12.601 --> 28:14.401
It's called Andromeda.

28:14.403 --> 28:17.037
That's the farthest thing visible
to the naked eye, actually.

28:17.039 --> 28:18.171
What is it, a star?

28:18.173 --> 28:20.109
No, it's a galaxy.

28:21.477 --> 28:27.247
See, our sun is one star
in the Milky Way galaxy.

28:27.249 --> 28:29.717
Do you know how many stars
there are in the Milky Way?

28:29.719 --> 28:31.351
I have no clue.

28:31.353 --> 28:32.953
Three hundred billion.

28:32.955 --> 28:33.987
Yeah. Right.

28:33.989 --> 28:38.693
And Andromeda is a galaxy
with one trillion stars.

28:38.695 --> 28:40.562
They all shine together.

28:42.030 --> 28:44.498
So, that, my new friend,

28:44.500 --> 28:46.502
is the definition
of wonder.

28:50.973 --> 28:54.143
God is so infinitely vast,

28:55.177 --> 28:57.012
and this is His painting.

28:58.647 --> 29:00.981
We paint with brushes,

29:00.983 --> 29:04.319
He paints with a billion stars
and a trillion galaxies.

29:07.523 --> 29:09.291
And He knows my name.

29:12.494 --> 29:16.265
The God of a trillion
stars knows my name.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.068
And He has a destiny
just for me.

29:22.504 --> 29:24.173
And I'm gonna
figure it out,

29:25.240 --> 29:26.475
someday.

29:36.351 --> 29:38.320
So that's how
I see the world,

29:39.354 --> 29:41.356
and myself in it.

29:48.731 --> 29:50.265
What are you thinking?

29:52.668 --> 29:55.037
That I've never met anyone
like you before.

29:56.739 --> 30:01.109
Well, I'm just one star
in an infinite galaxy.

30:06.315 --> 30:08.317
Some stars shine brighter
than others.

30:22.064 --> 30:23.698
- This is you, right?
- No, that's not me.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.365
- You sure?
- Nope. No, no, no. Shh.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.067
It's late! You're gonna
wake people up. This is me.

30:27.069 --> 30:28.168
This is me.

30:28.170 --> 30:30.439
- Okay.
- This is me.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.040
Um...

30:33.175 --> 30:34.677
So, Friday night?

30:35.477 --> 30:37.377
Yes.

30:37.379 --> 30:39.279
But, um,
could we just keep it

30:39.281 --> 30:42.082
between us right now at
first, you know?

30:42.084 --> 30:44.484
- Yeah. No, of course. Of course.
- Right?

30:44.486 --> 30:46.319
I'm great
at keeping secrets.

30:46.321 --> 30:48.121
Oh, I'm great
at keeping secrets too.

30:48.123 --> 30:49.356
Great.
It's a secret, then.

30:49.358 --> 30:50.359
Total secret.

30:54.797 --> 30:56.131
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:12.548 --> 31:14.281
Hey, sis.

31:14.283 --> 31:17.419
So, I met someone.

31:18.620 --> 31:20.721
<i>Joshua Tree.</i>
Perfect album.

31:20.723 --> 31:22.556
No way.
I think I have it.

31:22.558 --> 31:24.792
<i>His name is Jeremy.
Jeremy Camp.</i>

31:24.794 --> 31:28.295
<i>He plays music.
I love his songs.</i>

31:28.297 --> 31:29.229
<i>It's so good.</i>

31:29.231 --> 31:30.399
Right. So,
how do you play this?

31:32.401 --> 31:33.402
Okay, Prince?

31:36.171 --> 31:38.073
<i>And I don't know,
there's something about him.</i>

31:39.541 --> 31:41.742
That is the dryer.

31:41.744 --> 31:44.446
You may wanna start
with the washer.

31:45.782 --> 31:46.981
Right.

31:46.983 --> 31:48.615
<i>But we're just gonna
get to know each other.</i>

31:48.617 --> 31:50.352
<i>That's it.</i>

31:51.888 --> 31:53.088
What?

31:54.323 --> 31:57.357
- I mean, come on.
- That was amazing.

31:57.359 --> 31:58.658
Favorite place?

31:58.660 --> 31:59.829
Ocean.

Community service.

32:40.369 --> 32:43.203
When you realize
that life is bigger than you.

32:43.205 --> 32:44.638
- You grow when you see...
- I don't care.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.740
Mr. Camp.

32:45.742 --> 32:47.675
Hmm? Yes?

32:47.677 --> 32:48.678
You wanna come back to Earth?

32:50.713 --> 32:51.912
Honestly, not really.

32:53.582 --> 32:54.915
Aw.

32:54.917 --> 32:56.650
You got a little girlfriend?

32:56.652 --> 32:59.854
So cute. No, really.
It's really, really cute.

32:59.856 --> 33:01.321
- All right, you guys...
- Sorry.

33:01.323 --> 33:02.658
...sign-ups
are in the back.

33:05.895 --> 33:07.260
What's this?

33:07.262 --> 33:08.996
Right now,
it's just a blank tape.

33:08.998 --> 33:10.664
Mmm-mmm.
Tapes have soul.

33:10.666 --> 33:12.432
Why are you
giving this to me?

33:12.434 --> 33:15.402
Well, our record label's
paying for a new album.

33:15.404 --> 33:17.570
So I called the engineer.
He's a friend of mine.

33:17.572 --> 33:19.707
If we hustle, we'll have
an extra couple of hours.

33:19.709 --> 33:23.243
I can get you in there,
and we can turn that into your demo.

33:23.245 --> 33:25.012
- No.
- Two songs, maybe three.

33:25.014 --> 33:26.613
I'll send it off
to some producers.

33:26.615 --> 33:28.550
I don't know what to say.
Are you serious?

33:28.985 --> 33:30.417
Yeah.

33:30.419 --> 33:32.019
That's amazing.

33:32.021 --> 33:33.854
- That's...
- Very cool.

33:33.856 --> 33:35.622
- You're invited too.
- Hmm?

33:35.624 --> 33:38.658
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. I don't need to go...

33:38.660 --> 33:40.293
No, no, no. Forget that.

33:40.295 --> 33:41.394
Forget that.
I want you there.

33:41.396 --> 33:42.362
I don't wanna go.

33:42.364 --> 33:44.664
I have a song that I'd
like to play for you.

33:44.666 --> 33:46.701
- It'll be fun.
- Oh. Um,

33:46.703 --> 33:47.667
I don't think that's a...

33:47.669 --> 33:49.806
Hey, look, can I talk
to Melissa for a minute?

33:52.909 --> 33:54.407
Yeah, yeah, sure.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.576
- Uh... Oh, okay.
- I'll call you later.

33:56.578 --> 33:57.945
Yeah. I'll, uh,

33:57.947 --> 33:59.412
- see you later?
- Yeah.

33:59.414 --> 34:00.817
- Yep. Bye.
- Bye.

34:03.052 --> 34:04.921
You were out there
for a long time.

34:07.322 --> 34:08.490
Did he ask you out?

34:09.424 --> 34:10.425
Sort of.

34:11.326 --> 34:12.860
Okay. And?

34:12.862 --> 34:14.494
Doesn't this all
just bother you?

34:14.496 --> 34:15.963
Yeah, of course
it bothers me, Melissa.

34:15.965 --> 34:17.031
You should just tell him.

34:17.033 --> 34:19.468
I can't tell him. I...

34:22.772 --> 34:23.940
Are you wearing his jacket?

34:26.508 --> 34:27.509
Yeah.

34:28.811 --> 34:30.144
You're wearing
Jean-Luc's jacket?

34:30.146 --> 34:32.479
Yes. He gave it to me.
He said I didn't have enough clothes.

34:32.481 --> 34:33.580
And I actually
really like it.

34:33.582 --> 34:35.750
Wow.
This is just... I, I...

34:35.752 --> 34:38.585
I really cannot look at you
in the jacket.

34:38.587 --> 34:40.320
He gave me the jacket.

34:40.322 --> 34:41.490
It's not like I took it
from him.

34:43.025 --> 34:44.424
Maybe...

34:44.426 --> 34:47.427
Maybe we should
just rethink all of this.

34:47.429 --> 34:48.863
Rethink what,
us dating?

34:48.865 --> 34:51.832
See, now you're mad and
everyone seems to be mad.

34:51.834 --> 34:53.435
I'm not mad.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.639
Jeremy!

34:59.641 --> 35:01.643
- He's right there.
- Hi!

35:04.046 --> 35:05.578
Hey!

35:05.580 --> 35:07.614
Is this your girlfriend?

35:07.616 --> 35:09.451
- Perfect.
- Josh!

35:12.789 --> 35:14.420
So, how long
you two been dating?

35:14.422 --> 35:16.690
Um...

35:16.692 --> 35:19.894
It's... Not like that.

35:19.896 --> 35:23.398
Yeah. We're just trying
to get to know each other.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.968
He's really told us
all about you,

35:27.970 --> 35:29.671
- like a broken record.
- Mom.

35:30.605 --> 35:32.072
- Jeremy.
- What?

35:32.074 --> 35:33.808
I love Melissa.

35:33.810 --> 35:36.043
Jeremy has a girlfriend!

35:36.045 --> 35:37.612
Josh, that's enough. Come on.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.079
Eat your food.

35:39.081 --> 35:40.613
Jeremy has a...

35:40.615 --> 35:41.717
Jared, shut up.

35:44.754 --> 35:46.856
<i>Okay, you're walking
really fast.</i>

35:47.957 --> 35:49.957
- Why are you so mad?
- I'm not mad.

35:49.959 --> 35:51.658
Really? 'Cause you
seem mad to me.

35:51.660 --> 35:53.794
Maybe it's because you're
embarrassed by your family,

35:53.796 --> 35:54.929
and I don't get that.

35:54.931 --> 35:57.131
I wasn't embarrassed
by them.

35:57.133 --> 35:59.967
So, you're embarrassed
by me, then?

35:59.969 --> 36:01.836
I'm embarrassed by the fact

36:01.838 --> 36:03.737
that you don't want anyone
to know that we're dating.

36:03.739 --> 36:06.506
It's... It's awkward.

36:06.508 --> 36:07.574
What are we doing here?

36:07.576 --> 36:08.709
What do you even want?

36:08.711 --> 36:10.878
Give Jean-Luc
his jacket back.

36:14.951 --> 36:17.485
Oh, my gosh.

36:23.092 --> 36:25.761
<i>♪ This is my desire</i>

Gonna go
work on something,

37:28.623 --> 37:30.523
but I'll see you
in a bit.

37:30.525 --> 37:32.161
Can you hear me?
Do you wanna come in here?

37:40.602 --> 37:42.171
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:43.571 --> 37:44.740
That was
a really nice song.

37:45.507 --> 37:46.574
I'm sorry.

37:47.509 --> 37:48.641
Yeah, yeah.

37:48.643 --> 37:50.880
I'm really sorry.

37:52.248 --> 37:54.083
I'm really sorry.

37:54.582 --> 37:56.516
Um...

37:56.518 --> 37:58.919
I've been learning a new song,
just the chorus.

37:58.921 --> 38:00.721
Oh.

38:00.723 --> 38:02.191
- Can I play it to you?
- Sure.

38:07.296 --> 38:11.564

38:20.176 --> 38:21.744
Is that about God?

38:24.113 --> 38:25.513
Not entirely.

38:29.685 --> 38:30.786
Melissa.

38:31.586 --> 38:33.122
Yeah?

38:35.691 --> 38:36.993
I love you.

38:43.733 --> 38:45.565
Mmm.

38:45.567 --> 38:49.103
I don't think
that I'm ready for that.

38:49.105 --> 38:50.106
Um...

38:55.945 --> 38:56.946
Oh.

38:58.781 --> 39:00.347
Jean-Luc! Hey, hey.

39:00.349 --> 39:01.917
I'm so sorry.

39:03.285 --> 39:04.885
I did not want any of that
to happen. I just...

39:04.887 --> 39:06.020
Dude, let me explain.

39:06.022 --> 39:07.587
Don't bother.
There's nothing to explain.

39:07.589 --> 39:09.056
Hear me out.
Dude, I wanted to tell you,

39:09.058 --> 39:10.290
I just didn't know
what to say.

39:10.292 --> 39:12.592
The truth.

39:12.594 --> 39:14.230
You should've just
told me the truth.

39:17.967 --> 39:19.135
Melissa, you...

39:35.684 --> 39:37.186
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:38.220 --> 39:40.354
Um, can I come in?

39:40.356 --> 39:41.623
I...

39:42.992 --> 39:44.860
I don't think
that's a good idea.

39:49.999 --> 39:51.167
This is for you.

39:52.201 --> 39:53.202
It's, uh...

39:54.203 --> 39:55.269
It's another journal.

39:55.271 --> 39:56.703
I figure,
after what I've done,

39:56.705 --> 39:58.040
you could use
a lot more pages.

39:59.041 --> 40:00.042
Mmm.

40:02.644 --> 40:03.846
Wait.

40:05.347 --> 40:06.882
I'm sorry that happened.

40:08.284 --> 40:10.017
Obviously.

40:10.019 --> 40:11.020
But

40:12.254 --> 40:14.156
I'm also kind of relieved.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.256
Relieved?

40:16.258 --> 40:17.224
Yeah.

40:17.226 --> 40:19.159
I don't even know
what that means.

40:19.161 --> 40:21.261
I am not relieved.

40:21.263 --> 40:22.963
I don't think Jean-Luc
is relieved.

40:22.965 --> 40:24.698
Okay. "Relieved" isn't
the right word.

40:24.700 --> 40:27.103
I'm happy that
this is not a secret anymore.

40:28.070 --> 40:29.970
I didn't wanna
hurt him, okay?

40:29.972 --> 40:32.139
So, I'm sorry, I just really
don't wanna see you right now.

40:32.141 --> 40:33.907
Hold on. What are you saying?
We're breaking up?

40:33.909 --> 40:35.309
Call it what you want.

40:35.311 --> 40:36.712
Why, I call it breaking up.

40:38.714 --> 40:39.715
Okay.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.323
Then I don't wanna
see you for a while.

Some guy

43:08.264 --> 43:09.798
Sounds important.

Jean-Luc?

<i>Sorry to just call.
I didn't know if you'd heard.</i>

<i>Melissa's sick.</i>

43:21.877 --> 43:23.210
Well, is everything okay?

<i>Jeremy, it's pretty bad.</i>

43:25.281 --> 43:27.116
<i>You should get here.</i>

43:34.890 --> 43:36.859
Jeremy,
there's a map on the seat.

43:41.864 --> 43:43.330
You sure this is okay?

43:43.332 --> 43:44.398
Yeah, fine. Go.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.333
Just be careful.
It's a long drive.

43:46.335 --> 43:47.401
Call us
when you get there.

43:47.403 --> 43:48.404
Yeah.

44:23.906 --> 44:25.205
Hi.

44:25.207 --> 44:27.309
Uh, I'm here to see Melissa Henning.
I'm a friend of hers.

44:34.183 --> 44:36.151
Hey. Hey.

44:37.353 --> 44:39.319
- You're Jeremy, right?
- Yeah.

44:39.321 --> 44:40.454
Okay.

44:40.456 --> 44:44.291
Hi. We're Melissa's family.
She's told us all about you.

44:44.293 --> 44:45.561
Nice to meet you.

44:47.096 --> 44:49.129
Hi. You must be Heather.

44:49.131 --> 44:50.399
Mmm-hmm. Big sis.

44:51.467 --> 44:52.568
Uh, how is she?

44:54.036 --> 44:55.235
She's awake.

44:55.237 --> 44:56.670
Yeah.

44:56.672 --> 44:58.438
And I'm sure
she'd love to see you.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.541
- Come on.
- Yeah.

45:00.976 --> 45:03.011
Hey.
Look who I found.

45:04.714 --> 45:05.981
Hi.

45:06.448 --> 45:07.449
Hi.

45:08.283 --> 45:09.585
When did you get here?

45:10.285 --> 45:11.286
Last night.

45:11.987 --> 45:13.253
I drove.

45:13.255 --> 45:15.455
You drove? From Indiana?

45:15.457 --> 45:16.525
Yeah.

45:17.226 --> 45:18.291
Huh.

45:18.293 --> 45:19.493
You know what?
Let's...

45:19.495 --> 45:20.963
Let's give them
a minute, okay?

45:29.739 --> 45:31.340
So, um,

45:32.975 --> 45:34.476
what's going on?

45:35.177 --> 45:36.178
Um...

45:36.746 --> 45:38.113
They...

45:40.115 --> 45:43.016
They removed a,
um, tumor

45:43.018 --> 45:45.220
the size of an orange
from my stomach,

45:46.522 --> 45:48.590
tested it,

45:50.559 --> 45:53.126
and it turns out

45:53.128 --> 45:55.097
it's Stage 3C cancer,

45:57.366 --> 45:58.967
whatever that means.

45:59.601 --> 46:00.703
And, um,

46:01.637 --> 46:03.172
it spread to my liver.

46:04.106 --> 46:06.275
So, the truth is,

46:07.309 --> 46:11.714
the odds are not altogether
in my favor.

46:14.183 --> 46:15.716
Melissa, I'm so sorry.

46:15.718 --> 46:18.253
Don't be. It's okay.

46:20.456 --> 46:21.457
I'm okay.

46:23.292 --> 46:24.558
Somehow. I mean,

46:24.560 --> 46:26.195
I can't really describe it.
It's, like,

46:29.264 --> 46:30.599
warm,

46:31.768 --> 46:33.268
like a blanket.

46:35.170 --> 46:39.506
I've been listening to
this Ginny Owens song,

46:39.508 --> 46:40.509
<i>If You Want Me To.</i>

46:41.210 --> 46:42.442
Do you know it?

46:42.444 --> 46:43.543
Yeah.

46:43.545 --> 46:45.715
I just keep thinking,
maybe God

46:49.051 --> 46:51.220
has chosen something
bigger for me,

46:53.388 --> 46:55.725
something I wouldn't
have chosen for myself.

46:57.593 --> 47:00.460
But to be honest with you,

47:00.462 --> 47:02.498
I am so scared.

47:05.601 --> 47:08.070
But I have to believe
there's a reason.

47:10.472 --> 47:13.073
If one person's life
is changed

47:13.075 --> 47:15.177
by what I go through,

47:17.646 --> 47:19.348
it will all be worth it.

47:29.124 --> 47:30.624
Look, man.
I should've told you.

47:30.626 --> 47:31.826
Yeah.

47:31.828 --> 47:33.694
Yeah, you should've told me.

47:33.696 --> 47:36.565
It took me a while,
but I see it now, you two.

47:38.367 --> 47:40.801
Oh, man. I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

47:40.803 --> 47:43.405
I mean, I wanna be there
for her and I wanna help.

47:44.874 --> 47:47.274
I don't even really know
what we are, you know?

47:47.276 --> 47:49.409
How she feels about me.

47:49.411 --> 47:51.113
We've talked about it,

47:53.348 --> 47:55.317
but if she really is
that sick,

47:58.821 --> 48:00.522
it's just hard to know
what's ahead.

48:02.692 --> 48:04.794
There's only one question
you need to answer.

48:07.496 --> 48:08.831
Can you live without her?

48:30.887 --> 48:32.087
<i>God,</i>

48:34.256 --> 48:36.425
if she tells me
she loves me...

48:40.228 --> 48:41.597
This is ridiculous.

48:43.565 --> 48:44.799
It's ridiculous.

48:56.946 --> 48:58.779
- Hi.
- Hey.

48:58.781 --> 48:59.782
You came back.

49:00.783 --> 49:02.683
These are for you.

49:02.685 --> 49:06.286
Oh. They're so beautiful.
Thank you.

49:06.288 --> 49:08.254
Yeah. I thought I'd add
to the collection you got.

49:12.661 --> 49:14.628
You kept that.

49:14.630 --> 49:17.297
Oh, yeah. I've been using it
for a while, actually.

49:17.299 --> 49:19.301
I never got to say thank you.

49:20.636 --> 49:22.569
Still, uh...
Still can't read it?

49:22.571 --> 49:24.439
No, you cannot read it.

49:29.411 --> 49:30.579
Will you, um...

49:31.814 --> 49:32.947
Could you just help...

49:32.949 --> 49:34.815
Could you just help me up
for a second?

49:34.817 --> 49:36.318
Yes. Yeah.

49:37.386 --> 49:39.386
Okay. All right.

49:39.388 --> 49:41.724
Yeah. There we go.
There we go.

49:43.893 --> 49:44.927
This is...

49:46.428 --> 49:47.828
Okay. This is...

49:47.830 --> 49:50.731
What I'm about to say
is gonna be...

49:50.733 --> 49:52.432
Might be weird.

49:52.434 --> 49:53.801
Could be weird.

49:53.803 --> 49:55.570
- All right.
- Um...

49:56.706 --> 49:59.809
Okay, uh, so, I...

50:00.777 --> 50:03.576
Well, uh, the other day,

50:03.578 --> 50:05.880
when you came by,

50:05.882 --> 50:08.683
it just, uh...
It just really...

50:08.685 --> 50:10.785
It meant a lot to me.

50:12.254 --> 50:13.388
After you left,

50:14.523 --> 50:16.891
I had this feeling,

50:16.893 --> 50:20.763
like God wanted me
to pray for you.

50:22.330 --> 50:23.598
Okay.

50:25.001 --> 50:26.501
And for your wife.

50:28.537 --> 50:30.505
- My wife?
- Yeah. Is that weird?

50:31.506 --> 50:33.408
- I'm not sure yet.
- Okay.

50:34.643 --> 50:37.479
So, I started praying,

50:38.781 --> 50:41.514
and then the more I prayed,

50:41.516 --> 50:43.285
the more I realized,

50:49.859 --> 50:50.927
I love you.

50:55.397 --> 50:56.398
I love you.

50:58.500 --> 50:59.501
Mmm.

51:01.704 --> 51:03.238
I...

51:04.506 --> 51:05.640
I love you.

51:06.943 --> 51:07.944
I do.

51:13.049 --> 51:14.715
And you don't have
to say anything back.

51:14.717 --> 51:15.950
- I just really felt...
- Wait, wait, wait.

51:15.952 --> 51:18.085
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:18.087 --> 51:20.723
- Yeah?
- Uh, um...

51:24.927 --> 51:27.560
Can you just, uh...
Just wait here for one minute?

51:27.562 --> 51:29.797
Just a minute.
I'll be right back.

51:29.799 --> 51:31.364
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

51:31.366 --> 51:32.432
Okay. Yeah.

51:32.434 --> 51:34.702
Just, uh, don't move.

51:34.704 --> 51:37.339
- I can't move.
- I'll be right back.

52:07.536 --> 52:09.569
<i>That wasn't really a minute.</i>

52:09.571 --> 52:11.471
I think you said
"minute," right?

52:11.473 --> 52:12.940
Oh, yeah, no.
I'm sorry.

52:12.942 --> 52:15.812
Yeah. It was,
for sure, like, a while.

52:22.084 --> 52:23.618
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

52:30.458 --> 52:31.626
Open.

52:36.464 --> 52:37.465
What?

52:47.009 --> 52:48.676
How did you...

52:48.678 --> 52:50.177
That's why
it took me so long.

52:50.179 --> 52:51.513
Yeah.

52:57.452 --> 52:59.421
I wanted to bring
the galaxy to you.

53:05.493 --> 53:06.996
I want you to know

53:08.798 --> 53:12.467
that whatever this is,
and wherever it takes us,

53:13.602 --> 53:15.002
that I'm with you.

53:15.004 --> 53:17.670
Every step, every moment,
I'm with you. I'm in.

53:17.672 --> 53:19.574
I'm so in.

53:20.776 --> 53:21.777
And, um...

53:23.578 --> 53:25.578
And, you know, I figure
if we're gonna get married,

53:25.580 --> 53:26.615
we have a lot
to talk about.

53:30.019 --> 53:31.719
- Married?
- Yeah.

53:33.122 --> 53:34.790
I love you.

53:35.557 --> 53:37.994
I love you, I do, madly.

53:38.961 --> 53:40.194
So marry me.

53:40.196 --> 53:42.662
And I know relationships
need to be prayed about,

53:42.664 --> 53:44.164
and you can take as
much time as you need.

53:44.166 --> 53:45.498
But that's why
I brought you here...

53:45.500 --> 53:46.568
Yes.

53:48.237 --> 53:49.636
Yes.

53:49.638 --> 53:51.539
Yeah, I'll marry you.
I'll marry you.

53:53.075 --> 53:54.076
Yes.

54:07.589 --> 54:10.059
<i>Married?
You're gonna marry her?</i>

54:10.960 --> 54:12.161
<i>But will she get better?</i>

54:13.495 --> 54:14.560
I... I don't know.

54:14.562 --> 54:15.563
Son,

54:17.266 --> 54:19.266
you're only 20 years old.

54:19.268 --> 54:20.868
You just met this girl.

54:20.870 --> 54:22.202
I love her, Dad.

54:22.204 --> 54:23.804
And that's wonderful, but...

54:23.806 --> 54:26.840
Look, look, look. Why don't
you just...

54:26.842 --> 54:29.176
Just slow down,

54:29.178 --> 54:31.611
take a little more time,
you know?

54:31.613 --> 54:33.847
Go one step
at a time here.

54:33.849 --> 54:34.850
Dad,

54:36.986 --> 54:38.187
I'm supposed
to be with her.

54:40.222 --> 54:42.892
I can't explain it.
I just... I know that.

54:44.659 --> 54:47.161
And I don't want it to just be
her story and my story.

54:47.163 --> 54:48.998
I want it to be our story.

54:50.933 --> 54:53.135
I know you're worried,
and I get it.

54:54.170 --> 54:55.803
But...

54:55.805 --> 54:58.573
I'm gonna marry this girl.

55:07.249 --> 55:08.951
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:10.252 --> 55:11.253
Thanks.

55:13.655 --> 55:14.957
We made some breakfast.

55:17.760 --> 55:19.126
Wanna have some?

55:19.128 --> 55:20.495
Yeah. Sure.

55:23.966 --> 55:25.134
I brought you something.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.775
I want you to have this.

55:34.010 --> 55:35.109
Mom.

55:35.111 --> 55:37.244
My mom wore it her whole life
till my wedding day,

55:37.246 --> 55:40.082
and I've never
taken it off since.

55:45.788 --> 55:46.887
Are you sure?

55:46.889 --> 55:48.057
Of course.

55:49.158 --> 55:50.693
I just want her
to feel welcome.

56:01.837 --> 56:03.139
When you go.

56:24.827 --> 56:26.162
Are you sure about this?

56:26.829 --> 56:27.629
Melissa, I love you.

56:28.898 --> 56:31.000
And I believe
God is gonna heal you.

56:37.139 --> 56:38.974
Our life starts now.

56:44.914 --> 56:47.114
<i>Thank you.</i>

56:47.116 --> 56:49.316
<i>We've all heard his hit single
climbing the charts,</i>

56:49.318 --> 56:51.018
<i>but tonight,</i>

56:51.020 --> 56:53.787
<i>he's coming at you
with something brand-new.</i>

56:53.789 --> 56:56.256
<i>Please welcome Jeremy Camp.</i>

57:03.766 --> 57:05.768
- It's a good song.
- Thanks, man.

57:09.138 --> 57:10.370
Thank you.

57:16.779 --> 57:17.913
<i>Thanks, Jean-Luc.</i>

57:19.248 --> 57:20.414
<i>He's a legend.</i>

57:20.416 --> 57:23.383
<i>Uh, my name is Jeremy Camp</i>

57:23.385 --> 57:24.485
<i>and tonight
I'm gonna play you</i>

57:24.487 --> 57:27.389

<i>I want to introduce you guys
to someone special tonight.</i>

1:00:30.306 --> 1:00:32.306
<i>This is my fiancee, Melissa.</i>

1:00:34.510 --> 1:00:36.045
<i>Go ahead
and stand up, babe.</i>

1:00:41.183 --> 1:00:42.584
<i>Come on. Stand up.</i>

1:00:46.121 --> 1:00:48.290
<i>I know, I'm taken. I'm sorry.</i>

1:00:54.930 --> 1:00:58.033
<i>Earlier this year,
we had some tough news,</i>

1:01:00.502 --> 1:01:02.204
<i>some really tough news.</i>

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:09.278
<i>I've never seen a faith
like yours, babe.</i>

1:01:10.412 --> 1:01:11.545
<i>It's a beacon for me.</i>

1:01:11.547 --> 1:01:13.882
<i>It's a beacon for everyone
who knows you.</i>

1:01:15.050 --> 1:01:17.250
<i>It reminds me of a story.</i>

1:01:17.252 --> 1:01:19.519
<i>There was a woman who
was sick for a long time,</i>

1:01:19.521 --> 1:01:20.620
<i>a really long time.</i>

1:01:20.622 --> 1:01:22.057
<i>But she had this...</i>

1:01:23.025 --> 1:01:25.459
<i>This total faith</i>

1:01:25.461 --> 1:01:27.294
<i>that if she could
just touch Jesus,</i>

1:01:27.296 --> 1:01:29.396
<i>just touch his clothes,</i>

1:01:29.398 --> 1:01:31.665
<i>that she would be healed.</i>

1:01:31.667 --> 1:01:34.134
<i>And that's exactly
what she did.</i>

1:01:34.136 --> 1:01:35.703
<i>She broke through the crowd,</i>

1:01:35.705 --> 1:01:37.573
<i>and with everything
that she had,</i>

1:01:38.708 --> 1:01:40.075
<i>she reached for Him.</i>

1:01:43.045 --> 1:01:46.380
<i>Just like I see you do at
every single concert, Melissa,</i>

1:01:46.382 --> 1:01:48.117
<i>reaching out in faith,</i>

1:01:49.151 --> 1:01:50.552
<i>touching heaven.</i>

1:01:54.623 --> 1:01:55.889
<i>Can we do something special</i>

1:01:55.891 --> 1:01:58.358
<i>for the most special person
in my life tonight?</i>

1:02:01.397 --> 1:02:03.363
<i>Can we pray for her?</i>

1:02:03.365 --> 1:02:06.166
<i>Because I believe
that God still heals.</i>

1:02:06.168 --> 1:02:09.104
- <i>You guys agree?</i>
- Yeah!

1:02:10.072 --> 1:02:11.706
Yes.

1:02:11.708 --> 1:02:12.906
<i>Anyone who's sitting
around her,</i>

1:02:12.908 --> 1:02:15.609
<i>why don't you go ahead
and lay a hand on her.</i>

1:02:15.611 --> 1:02:18.313
<i>If not, just put your hands
in the air.</i>

1:02:27.122 --> 1:02:29.024
<i>God, heal the love of my life.</i>

1:02:34.663 --> 1:02:36.198
<i>Heal her tonight.</i>

1:02:55.417 --> 1:02:57.586
Melissa, your hair isn't
what makes you beautiful.

1:03:02.391 --> 1:03:03.457
Hey.

1:03:03.459 --> 1:03:04.460
Um...

1:03:05.695 --> 1:03:07.394
Why don't you go take
a walk or something?

1:03:07.396 --> 1:03:09.498
This is kind of
a big deal for her.

1:03:10.632 --> 1:03:12.432
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:03:12.434 --> 1:03:13.533
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

1:03:13.535 --> 1:03:15.604
No, no, no. It's okay.
Just, you know...

1:03:16.505 --> 1:03:17.571
All right.

1:03:37.192 --> 1:03:38.625
<i>Yeah.
You know, she's...</i>

1:03:38.627 --> 1:03:41.428
<i>Um, she's living at home now.</i>

1:03:41.430 --> 1:03:43.463
<i>I'm just helping
take care of her.</i>

1:03:43.465 --> 1:03:45.599
<i>And I just think that, um...</i>

1:03:45.601 --> 1:03:47.302
That school can wait.

1:03:48.670 --> 1:03:51.206
Right now, this is the only
thing that matters to me.

1:03:52.608 --> 1:03:55.077
So, I'll be a semester,

1:03:55.778 --> 1:03:57.145
maybe more.

1:03:58.781 --> 1:04:01.281
Well, son, that's noble.

1:04:01.283 --> 1:04:04.353
But I wonder,
is it really wise?

1:04:07.155 --> 1:04:08.590
Well, it's, uh...

1:04:09.424 --> 1:04:11.126
It's what's necessary, sir.

1:04:17.165 --> 1:04:19.232
So, even after
the chemotherapy,

1:04:19.234 --> 1:04:22.437
we're seeing growth
in your scan.

1:04:25.842 --> 1:04:28.174
I'm seeing them
on your ovaries.

1:04:28.176 --> 1:04:29.511
And I'm sorry,

1:04:30.847 --> 1:04:34.414
but you're going to need
a hysterectomy.

1:04:34.416 --> 1:04:38.151
I know that this is
a serious decision,

1:04:38.153 --> 1:04:40.320
but I recommend that
it be done very soon.

1:04:40.322 --> 1:04:41.388
How soon?

1:04:41.390 --> 1:04:43.425
In the next week,
two at the most.

1:04:45.627 --> 1:04:48.461
Our doctors are extremely
skilled, and the risks are low.

1:04:48.463 --> 1:04:50.530
Wait.

1:04:50.532 --> 1:04:53.268
Are you telling me that I'm not
gonna be able to have children?

1:04:56.204 --> 1:04:57.270
I'm afraid so.

1:04:57.272 --> 1:04:58.307
Hey. It's okay.

1:05:00.810 --> 1:05:02.712
No, no, it's not.

1:05:03.846 --> 1:05:05.213
I love kids.

1:05:06.248 --> 1:05:08.582
You're so good
with kids.

1:05:08.584 --> 1:05:11.251
Melissa,
it's my professional opinion

1:05:11.253 --> 1:05:13.288
that this is
absolutely necessary,

1:05:14.456 --> 1:05:16.156
given your condition

1:05:16.158 --> 1:05:17.257
and what we're seeing
on the tests.

1:05:17.259 --> 1:05:19.860
Well, then run more tests,
please. Just run more tests.

1:05:19.862 --> 1:05:21.129
We've run them all.

1:05:22.464 --> 1:05:24.099
And they're very conclusive.

1:05:25.300 --> 1:05:26.366
Mmm.

1:05:33.676 --> 1:05:35.210
Want me
to make you something?

1:05:36.511 --> 1:05:37.814
No, I got it.

1:05:39.716 --> 1:05:41.516
- Here. Let me do it.
- No, no. It's okay.

1:05:42.484 --> 1:05:44.119
I need a second.

1:06:24.694 --> 1:06:25.695
Oh!

1:06:32.367 --> 1:06:34.169
Oh, no. Oh, God.

1:06:37.339 --> 1:06:38.505
Hey.

1:06:38.507 --> 1:06:40.810
No, no. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:06:42.611 --> 1:06:45.614
Okay, okay.
I just can't...

1:06:57.325 --> 1:06:58.693
<i>Welcome back to The Fish,</i>

1:06:58.695 --> 1:06:59.694
<i>Los Angeles,</i>

1:06:59.696 --> 1:07:00.828
<i>and we have
a great young artist</i>

1:07:00.830 --> 1:07:02.063
<i>in the studio with us today,
Jeremy Camp.</i>

1:07:02.065 --> 1:07:04.899
<i>Yes. And Jeremy's
gonna do some songs</i>

1:07:04.901 --> 1:07:06.499
<i>live for us in just a minute.</i>

1:07:06.501 --> 1:07:07.667
<i>But first, Jeremy,</i>

1:07:07.669 --> 1:07:10.437
<i>you have some pretty big news
you wanted to share with us?</i>

1:07:10.439 --> 1:07:11.538
<i>I do, yeah.</i>

1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:13.506
First off, thank you so much
for having me.

1:07:13.508 --> 1:07:17.477
Um, for everyone listening,
my fiancee's name is Melissa.

1:07:17.479 --> 1:07:18.846
Uh,

1:07:18.848 --> 1:07:21.281
she has a huge surgery
coming up this week,

1:07:21.283 --> 1:07:22.950
and it's really serious.

1:07:22.952 --> 1:07:25.720
And basically,
she needs a miracle.

1:07:25.722 --> 1:07:28.354
So I just wanted to
ask everyone listening,

1:07:28.356 --> 1:07:31.391
if you could just stop
what you're doing and pray.

1:07:31.393 --> 1:07:33.928
<i>I'll do the playing.
You guys do the praying.</i>

1:07:33.930 --> 1:07:35.562
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:08:20.877 --> 1:08:22.410
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

1:08:22.945 --> 1:08:24.044
I, uh...

1:08:24.046 --> 1:08:25.748
I stopped by
the radio station,

1:08:27.016 --> 1:08:29.083
and it's like
the whole city's praying.

1:08:29.085 --> 1:08:31.018
Dude, these letters are
pouring in from everywhere.

1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:32.652
No way.

1:08:32.654 --> 1:08:34.891
I thought
you'd want to have them.

1:08:35.958 --> 1:08:37.357
Hang in there.

1:08:37.359 --> 1:08:38.527
Thanks, man.

1:09:00.783 --> 1:09:02.051
Can I sit with you?

1:09:03.418 --> 1:09:04.419
Yeah.

1:09:16.098 --> 1:09:18.567
It's so weird
seeing her here.

1:09:19.936 --> 1:09:21.636
She's always been
the strong one.

1:09:24.740 --> 1:09:26.042
Yeah.

1:09:28.044 --> 1:09:30.913
I'm really glad that
in the midst of all of this,

1:09:32.414 --> 1:09:33.716
someone is choosing her,

1:09:35.117 --> 1:09:36.752
someone really special.

1:09:38.420 --> 1:09:41.521
Thank you for giving her
a chance...

1:09:41.523 --> 1:09:42.524
Jeremy!

1:09:42.792 --> 1:09:43.793
Jeremy!

1:09:47.196 --> 1:09:48.461
Yeah.

1:10:02.577 --> 1:10:03.744
Mmm.

1:10:10.152 --> 1:10:11.153
Hey.

1:10:12.889 --> 1:10:13.890
Jeremy.

1:10:21.463 --> 1:10:23.063
Your cancer,

1:10:23.065 --> 1:10:25.065
it's gone.

1:10:25.067 --> 1:10:27.069
They didn't go through
with the surgery.

1:10:28.704 --> 1:10:30.072
You're cancer-free.

1:10:31.673 --> 1:10:34.176
And that is the story you're
gonna tell our kids one day.

1:10:41.183 --> 1:10:42.683
You know what you are?

1:10:42.685 --> 1:10:44.617
<i>If
anyone here has ever wondered</i>

1:10:44.619 --> 1:10:45.788
<i>if miracles still happen,</i>

1:10:47.056 --> 1:10:48.991
<i>or if God still heals,</i>

1:10:51.093 --> 1:10:52.226
<i>then I wanna introduce you</i>

1:10:52.228 --> 1:10:54.196
<i>to the most beautiful girl
in this room.</i>

1:11:22.657 --> 1:11:23.993
You're a miracle.

1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:26.829
That's what you are.

1:11:38.975 --> 1:11:40.209
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

1:11:41.143 --> 1:11:44.111
<i>I spoke to the doctor myself.</i>

1:11:44.113 --> 1:11:46.680
<i>There is literally
no medical explanation,</i>

1:11:46.682 --> 1:11:48.614
none whatsoever.

1:11:48.616 --> 1:11:49.683
That is awesome.

1:11:49.685 --> 1:11:50.951
For everyone listening
out there,

1:11:50.953 --> 1:11:52.686
<i>on positive,
encouraging K-LOVE,</i>

1:11:52.688 --> 1:11:54.888
<i>she's 100% cancer-free.</i>

1:11:54.890 --> 1:11:56.622
<i>Amen. Yes, she is.</i>

1:12:40.736 --> 1:12:42.836
I will love you,

1:12:42.838 --> 1:12:44.772
cherish you,

1:12:44.774 --> 1:12:45.841
honor you,

1:12:46.942 --> 1:12:49.309
every moment of every day

1:12:49.311 --> 1:12:50.813
without hesitation

1:12:51.613 --> 1:12:52.782
and never looking back.

1:12:53.983 --> 1:12:56.250
I'll encourage you,

1:12:56.252 --> 1:12:57.720
lift you up,

1:12:58.788 --> 1:13:00.788
I'll be your muse

1:13:00.790 --> 1:13:03.025
and your anchor.

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:06.628
I'll be the love of your life

1:13:07.730 --> 1:13:10.199
and your biggest fan.

1:13:11.367 --> 1:13:13.302
Until death do we part.

1:13:14.370 --> 1:13:16.739
Nope, past that.

1:13:18.007 --> 1:13:19.742
I will love you past that.

1:13:22.378 --> 1:13:25.214
Son, you may
kiss the bride.

1:13:31.153 --> 1:13:32.652
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:13:32.654 --> 1:13:35.022
- Mr. and Mrs. Jeremy Camp.
- Aw.

1:14:37.853 --> 1:14:39.753
Through the storm
and out the other side.

1:14:39.755 --> 1:14:40.756
Can you believe it?

1:14:41.423 --> 1:14:42.791
Mmm-mmm.

1:14:45.995 --> 1:14:48.898
Thank you,
Jeremy Camp.

1:14:50.266 --> 1:14:53.500
I think I would have died
without you.

1:14:53.502 --> 1:14:55.738
I would have been lost
and alone at sea.

1:14:58.374 --> 1:15:00.843
God sent you to save me.

1:15:04.947 --> 1:15:07.781
Melissa Camp.

1:15:07.783 --> 1:15:10.217
I like
the sound of that.

1:15:10.219 --> 1:15:11.518
- <i>Ready?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:14.356
- Okay. One, two, three.
- ...two, three.

1:15:22.131 --> 1:15:22.932
What did you wish for?

1:15:24.233 --> 1:15:25.801
I wrote down
some names...

1:15:26.902 --> 1:15:29.136
Names I've been dreaming of.

1:15:29.138 --> 1:15:31.006
- Family?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:15:35.277 --> 1:15:38.178
I've got
a surprise for you tomorrow.

1:15:38.180 --> 1:15:39.348
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:16:16.085 --> 1:16:17.150
Phew.

1:16:17.152 --> 1:16:19.154
That's, uh,
so strange.

1:16:19.989 --> 1:16:21.088
What?

1:16:21.090 --> 1:16:23.357
Oh, uh...
I don't know.

1:16:23.359 --> 1:16:24.958
You've never
been sailing

1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:26.295
and I'm the one
who gets sick.

1:16:37.973 --> 1:16:40.841
<i>♪ Will I believe You</i>

1:16:40.843 --> 1:16:43.078
<i>♪ When You say</i>

1:16:45.281 --> 1:16:51.053
<i>♪ That Your hand will guide me
In every way</i>

1:17:00.329 --> 1:17:03.063
<i>♪ Walk by me</i>

1:17:12.608 --> 1:17:16.145
Jeremy. Hey. Hey.

1:17:21.317 --> 1:17:23.085
Something's wrong.

1:17:24.953 --> 1:17:28.257
Something is really wrong.

1:17:39.902 --> 1:17:40.969
Hey.

1:17:41.637 --> 1:17:42.838
How does it feel?

1:17:54.383 --> 1:17:56.416
- Jeremy.
- Hey. Wanna come in?

1:17:56.418 --> 1:17:58.587
No. Actually,
let's talk out here.

1:18:05.494 --> 1:18:07.060
So, what's going on?

1:18:07.062 --> 1:18:09.998
She's having a little
pain, feeling bloated.

1:18:11.567 --> 1:18:14.503
Liss, hey.
I'm sure it's fine.

1:18:15.337 --> 1:18:16.670
The cancer's come back.

1:18:16.672 --> 1:18:18.874
It's spreading rapidly.
It's all over her body.

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:27.547
Okay. What does that mean?

1:18:27.549 --> 1:18:29.583
That means we have
to have another surgery?

1:18:29.585 --> 1:18:32.619
No. No more surgeries.

1:18:32.621 --> 1:18:33.622
What? Chemo then?

1:18:35.991 --> 1:18:38.026
No. We're stopping
treatments.

1:18:39.395 --> 1:18:41.461
There's nothing else
we can do.

1:18:41.463 --> 1:18:42.529
I'm afraid to say

1:18:42.531 --> 1:18:44.133
she only has
a few weeks,

1:18:45.134 --> 1:18:46.402
a couple months
at the most.

1:18:48.070 --> 1:18:49.405
I'm so sorry, Jeremy.

1:19:38.020 --> 1:19:39.021
I'll be right back.

1:20:43.252 --> 1:20:44.719
Okay.

1:20:44.721 --> 1:20:46.188
This should help
with the pain.

1:20:51.326 --> 1:20:52.327
Squirt.

1:20:54.263 --> 1:20:55.531
Clamp.

1:20:57.099 --> 1:20:58.100
Swab.

1:21:11.647 --> 1:21:12.648
Okay.

1:21:15.785 --> 1:21:16.786
We got this.

1:21:23.191 --> 1:21:24.359
We got this.

1:21:30.465 --> 1:21:33.734
Is there a concert
I didn't know about?

1:21:33.736 --> 1:21:36.338
Not a great turnout,
Jeremy Camp.

1:21:38.407 --> 1:21:40.108
No. I just wanted you
to see it.

1:21:43.378 --> 1:21:44.379
See what?

1:21:46.281 --> 1:21:47.449
Where it happened for me.

1:21:49.551 --> 1:21:50.787
This is where
I was standing.

1:21:52.889 --> 1:21:54.556
Right here,

1:21:55.758 --> 1:21:57.457
when I fell in love with you.

1:21:59.796 --> 1:22:01.597
Come on. "Fell in love?"

1:22:02.765 --> 1:22:04.499
- On the first night?
- Yeah.

1:22:07.937 --> 1:22:09.806
You were sitting
right there.

1:22:12.909 --> 1:22:17.880
The girl who sat there
seems so far away now.

1:22:20.817 --> 1:22:22.819
I feel like
a shadow of her.

1:22:26.288 --> 1:22:27.623
On our first date,

1:22:29.458 --> 1:22:30.760
you said,

1:22:32.829 --> 1:22:33.928
"Some stars

1:22:33.930 --> 1:22:35.597
"shine brighter than others."

1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:40.502
You know the stars
that shine the brightest?

1:22:44.941 --> 1:22:47.175
The ones
with the shortest life.

1:22:49.444 --> 1:22:50.880
And when they die,

1:22:52.749 --> 1:22:56.650
they explode
in a supernova.

1:22:56.652 --> 1:22:57.653
It's...

1:22:58.654 --> 1:23:00.522
It's the most
beautiful thing.

1:23:02.357 --> 1:23:05.928
Color and light
all mixed together,

1:23:08.765 --> 1:23:09.932
God's painting.

1:23:12.902 --> 1:23:14.969
The death
of a single star

1:23:14.971 --> 1:23:17.570
outshines everything
else in the galaxy.

1:23:17.572 --> 1:23:18.573
Melissa.

1:23:23.913 --> 1:23:25.980
What if I'm not
supposed to be healed?

1:23:25.982 --> 1:23:28.350
No, don't. Don't.

1:23:29.518 --> 1:23:30.383
Don't say that.

1:23:30.385 --> 1:23:32.487
I want you to
promise me something.

1:23:35.758 --> 1:23:37.490
I want you
to find someone else.

1:23:37.492 --> 1:23:38.895
Don't. Don't.

1:23:50.472 --> 1:23:51.974
You're going to be healed.

1:23:54.811 --> 1:23:55.910
I promise you that.

1:23:55.912 --> 1:23:56.913
Jeremy.

1:23:59.281 --> 1:24:00.615
Would you just stop?

1:24:03.820 --> 1:24:06.956
Stop making promises
that aren't yours to make.

1:24:37.954 --> 1:24:39.086
Jeez. Did I forget the dose?

1:24:39.088 --> 1:24:41.554
It hurts. It hurts.

1:24:41.556 --> 1:24:42.957
So bad.

1:24:42.959 --> 1:24:44.657
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Melissa. No. You're not okay.

1:24:44.659 --> 1:24:45.726
- Come on.
- No. I'm okay.

1:24:45.728 --> 1:24:47.362
We're going to the hospital.
Come on.

1:24:49.431 --> 1:24:51.968
Help! Somebody help!

1:24:52.835 --> 1:24:54.068
Somebody help!

1:24:54.070 --> 1:24:56.704
Nurse, we're gonna
need a wheelchair!

1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:32.541
When's the
last time you slept?

1:25:39.015 --> 1:25:41.081
Go home. Get some rest.
Go shower.

1:25:41.083 --> 1:25:43.583
- We got this.
- I can't.

1:25:43.585 --> 1:25:44.854
Just get a few hours.

1:25:46.555 --> 1:25:47.855
Come on. Go home.

1:25:50.625 --> 1:25:51.961
She is my home.

1:26:13.716 --> 1:26:14.717
Hey.

1:26:16.185 --> 1:26:17.385
Hey.

1:26:28.663 --> 1:26:29.999
Did you finish the song,

1:26:32.001 --> 1:26:34.003
the one from our honeymoon?

1:26:36.839 --> 1:26:38.406
Yeah.

1:26:40.142 --> 1:26:42.044
Will you please
play it for me?

1:27:21.650 --> 1:27:26.989
<i>♪ Would you believe me
When I say</i>

1:27:28.523 --> 1:27:32.929
<i>♪ That Your hand
Will guide every way</i>

1:27:35.064 --> 1:27:41.037
<i>♪ Every moment, every day</i>

1:27:43.940 --> 1:27:48.811
<i>♪ Well, I will walk by faith</i>

1:27:50.947 --> 1:27:54.884
<i>♪ Even when I don't see</i>

1:27:57.687 --> 1:28:02.524
<i>♪ Even a broken road</i>

1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:08.030
<i>♪ Prepares Your will for me</i>

1:28:18.007 --> 1:28:23.578
<i>♪ Well, I will walk by faith</i>

1:28:26.983 --> 1:28:30.820
<i>♪ Even when I don't see</i>

1:28:35.191 --> 1:28:39.661
<i>♪ Even when I don't see</i>

1:28:55.211 --> 1:28:59.148
That was so beautiful.

1:29:24.373 --> 1:29:25.573
Are you okay?

1:29:31.947 --> 1:29:32.948
You okay?

1:29:35.284 --> 1:29:36.285
It's God.

1:29:38.087 --> 1:29:39.353
- It's God.
- What do you mean?

1:29:39.355 --> 1:29:41.221
I'm healed.

1:29:41.223 --> 1:29:43.323
It doesn't hurt anymore.
I can't feel it.

1:29:43.325 --> 1:29:44.725
You were right.

1:29:44.727 --> 1:29:46.326
I'm telling you,
I'm healed.

1:29:46.328 --> 1:29:47.361
I think I'm okay.
I think I'm okay.

1:29:47.363 --> 1:29:48.996
Babe, lie down, lie down.
I'll get the doctor.

1:29:48.998 --> 1:29:50.232
You have to believe me.

1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:52.768
Just believe me.

1:29:54.236 --> 1:29:55.271
I'm okay.

1:29:56.671 --> 1:29:59.239
Okay. I'm gonna
get the doctor.

1:29:59.241 --> 1:30:01.408
Excuse me, can I get
a doctor for my wife?

1:30:01.410 --> 1:30:03.243
Okay. Slow down.
What's the issue?

1:30:03.245 --> 1:30:06.680
Dr. Furst,
Melissa's awake.

1:30:07.783 --> 1:30:10.019
Someone help! Someone help!

1:30:20.296 --> 1:30:21.629
I love you.

1:30:34.410 --> 1:30:35.945
She's with Jesus.

1:30:42.184 --> 1:30:43.285
No.

1:30:50.426 --> 1:30:52.795
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1:31:05.474 --> 1:31:07.074
I'm Tom Camp.

1:31:07.076 --> 1:31:08.976
I'm looking for my son,
Jeremy.

1:31:08.978 --> 1:31:10.212
Mr. Camp.

1:31:11.247 --> 1:31:12.880
He's still in the room.

1:32:47.243 --> 1:32:49.142
Get some sleep.

1:32:49.144 --> 1:32:50.410
See you in the morning.

1:32:50.412 --> 1:32:53.814
Mom and I will have breakfast
ready for you when you get up.

1:32:53.816 --> 1:32:54.984
Dad?

1:32:58.988 --> 1:33:00.089
Can I ask you a question?

1:33:02.591 --> 1:33:03.859
Anything.

1:33:11.267 --> 1:33:13.969
I remember I prayed
and prayed in this room

1:33:16.305 --> 1:33:18.007
for Josh to be
born healthy.

1:33:21.076 --> 1:33:22.511
It didn't happen.

1:33:24.947 --> 1:33:27.116
And you prayed for so long
for your ministry.

1:33:30.486 --> 1:33:31.487
Still nothing.

1:33:33.555 --> 1:33:35.924
Dad, I begged God
to heal Melissa.

1:33:41.630 --> 1:33:43.332
What am I supposed
to do with that?

1:33:49.938 --> 1:33:53.573
Are you asking
if Josh's disabilities

1:33:53.575 --> 1:33:54.810
were disappointing?

1:33:59.048 --> 1:34:00.382
Yes, they are.

1:34:04.086 --> 1:34:06.586
Did I have big dreams
that didn't come true?

1:34:06.588 --> 1:34:07.589
Sure.

1:34:10.959 --> 1:34:14.129
Do I understand why Melissa
isn't here anymore?

1:34:17.299 --> 1:34:19.468
No, son, I don't.

1:34:22.905 --> 1:34:23.906
I'm sorry.

1:34:26.975 --> 1:34:28.844
But I know
my life is full.

1:34:32.348 --> 1:34:34.014
I feel rich,

1:34:34.016 --> 1:34:35.451
and I'm proud
of this family.

1:34:40.322 --> 1:34:41.521
Honestly, at the time,

1:34:41.523 --> 1:34:44.091
I didn't agree
with what you did.

1:34:44.093 --> 1:34:45.327
I didn't understand it.

1:34:48.230 --> 1:34:51.033
You chose willingly to walk
into the fire with her.

1:34:52.634 --> 1:34:55.237
Right beside her,
all the way to the end.

1:34:59.608 --> 1:35:01.241
But then,

1:35:01.243 --> 1:35:05.114
that's exactly what I would do
for your mom and you boys.

1:35:08.183 --> 1:35:09.518
That's what love is.

1:35:15.124 --> 1:35:17.292
And I got to watch
my son do that.

1:35:19.696 --> 1:35:20.896
For his wife.

1:35:22.598 --> 1:35:23.532
That was a privilege.

1:35:27.603 --> 1:35:30.272
I don't know the answers
to your questions.

1:35:34.176 --> 1:35:35.377
But I do know this,

1:35:37.279 --> 1:35:38.645
that my life is not full

1:35:38.647 --> 1:35:41.049
in spite of
the disappointments.

1:35:45.187 --> 1:35:46.689
It's full because of them.

1:35:53.128 --> 1:35:54.263
I'm proud of you.

1:35:56.999 --> 1:35:58.066
I love you, Dad.

1:36:27.262 --> 1:36:28.263
<i>Jeremy.</i>

1:36:30.265 --> 1:36:32.098
<i>I'm healed.</i>

1:36:32.100 --> 1:36:34.100
<i>I think I'm healed. It's God.</i>

1:36:34.102 --> 1:36:36.403
You know the stars
that shine the brightest?

1:36:36.405 --> 1:36:38.038
<i>The ones
with the shortest life.</i>

1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:39.172
You're going to be healed.

1:36:39.174 --> 1:36:40.607
<i>I need a doctor!</i>

1:36:40.609 --> 1:36:42.108
<i>I promise you.</i>

1:36:42.110 --> 1:36:43.477
<i>It doesn't hurt anymore.</i>

1:36:43.479 --> 1:36:44.511
<i>I can't feel it.</i>

1:36:44.513 --> 1:36:47.080
<i>You were right.
You have to believe...</i>

1:37:04.633 --> 1:37:06.068
Why did You do this?

1:38:28.818 --> 1:38:29.819
<i>Jeremy.</i>

1:38:31.888 --> 1:38:34.922
<i>I know
you'll find this someday.</i>

1:38:34.924 --> 1:38:39.694
<i>See? I'm finally letting you
read my journal.</i>

1:38:39.696 --> 1:38:43.432
<i>And I've thought a lot about
the day I realized I loved you.</i>

1:38:44.701 --> 1:38:45.702
<i>Remember?</i>

1:38:52.875 --> 1:38:58.211
<i>I just watched you there,
awestruck by your gift.</i>

1:38:58.213 --> 1:39:01.383
<i>Knowing God would use it
someday to touch the world.</i>

1:39:02.651 --> 1:39:04.887
<i>I felt that day
the same way I do now.</i>

1:39:08.825 --> 1:39:11.293
<i>You're asleep on my shoulder
right now.</i>

1:39:12.661 --> 1:39:13.794
<i>I guess one of the benefits</i>

1:39:13.796 --> 1:39:16.164
<i>of the pain is that
it's hard to sleep.</i>

1:39:17.432 --> 1:39:21.368
<i>Which means I have
a lot of time to think.</i>

1:39:21.370 --> 1:39:23.570
<i>And I've thought a lot
about the stories</i>

1:39:23.572 --> 1:39:26.341
<i>you love to tell
at your concerts.</i>

1:39:27.409 --> 1:39:28.811
<i>You're so good at it.</i>

1:39:30.212 --> 1:39:31.446
<i>Ancient stories,</i>

1:39:32.314 --> 1:39:34.249
<i>still relevant and true.</i>

1:39:35.718 --> 1:39:38.788
<i>In one story,
God grants healing.</i>

1:39:39.756 --> 1:39:42.489
<i>Miracles do happen.</i>

1:39:42.491 --> 1:39:46.428
<i>Yet to another, His call
is to suffer, and even die.</i>

1:39:48.731 --> 1:39:50.532
<i>And I realized something,</i>

1:39:52.601 --> 1:39:55.602
<i>they both have value.</i>

1:39:55.604 --> 1:39:58.906
<i>Because each is a chapter
in a bigger story.</i>

1:39:58.908 --> 1:40:03.576
<i>Each is the stroke of a brush
on His beautiful canvas.</i>

1:40:03.578 --> 1:40:09.418
<i>Each is the light of one star
helping to form a galaxy.</i>

1:40:11.921 --> 1:40:13.821
<i>And I think I'm one of
those lucky people</i>

1:40:13.823 --> 1:40:15.624
<i>meant to experience both.</i>

1:40:17.626 --> 1:40:19.960
<i>I had my miracle.</i>

1:40:19.962 --> 1:40:22.699
<i>It led to the perfect day
with you.</i>

1:40:23.331 --> 1:40:25.665
<i>It was enough.</i>

1:40:25.667 --> 1:40:29.737
<i>I've learned that suffering
doesn't destroy faith,</i>

1:40:29.739 --> 1:40:30.907
<i>it refines it.</i>

1:40:32.507 --> 1:40:34.875
<i>And God is worth trusting.</i>

1:40:34.877 --> 1:40:37.212
<i>Even when we can't see.</i>

1:40:38.547 --> 1:40:40.480
<i>I'm safe in His arms</i>

1:40:40.482 --> 1:40:42.683
<i>going bravely into the light
with a peace</i>

1:40:42.685 --> 1:40:45.287
<i>that I can't understand.</i>

1:41:01.070 --> 1:41:03.638
<i>So, do one thing
for me, Jeremy Camp,</i>

1:41:04.473 --> 1:41:06.306
<i>for my sake.</i>

1:41:06.308 --> 1:41:09.812
<i>For the sake of your gift
and everyone meant to hear it.</i>

1:41:13.448 --> 1:41:14.449
<i>When you're ready,</i>

1:41:17.687 --> 1:41:18.921
<i>pick up your guitar.</i>

1:42:55.718 --> 1:42:57.584
<i>And now,
we have an artist</i>

1:42:57.586 --> 1:42:59.186
<i>with his first gold record</i>

1:42:59.188 --> 1:43:02.122
<i>with five number one
hit singles.</i>

1:43:02.124 --> 1:43:03.958
<i>He has a story to tell.</i>

1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:07.427
<i>Let's welcome
my friend Jeremy Camp.</i>

1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:25.445
<i>What's going on, guys?</i>

1:43:25.447 --> 1:43:27.083
<i>My name is Jeremy Camp.</i>

1:43:27.717 --> 1:43:29.750
<i>Uh...</i>

1:43:29.752 --> 1:43:34.487
<i>A few years ago,
I met a girl named Melissa,</i>

1:43:34.489 --> 1:43:37.159
<i>and she is, and always will
be, the love of my life.</i>

1:43:38.660 --> 1:43:41.561
<i>Melissa died
with this incomprehensible,</i>

1:43:41.563 --> 1:43:43.797
<i>selfless faith.</i>

1:43:43.799 --> 1:43:46.802
<i>She was always
reaching for heaven.</i>

1:43:49.138 --> 1:43:51.007
<i>And I believe
she finally touched it.</i>

1:43:54.010 --> 1:43:55.342
<i>I believe
she finally touched it,</i>

1:43:55.344 --> 1:43:58.746
<i>and she had to tell me that
there would be another day,</i>

1:43:58.748 --> 1:44:00.748
<i>with no more pain,</i>

1:44:00.750 --> 1:44:02.615
<i>with no more tears,
with no more sorrow,</i>

1:44:02.617 --> 1:44:05.922
<i>another day where I would
get to see her again.</i>

1:44:07.690 --> 1:44:11.591
<i>I know I'm not the only one
hurting here today.</i>

1:44:11.593 --> 1:44:13.559
<i>She told me that
if just one person's life</i>

1:44:13.561 --> 1:44:14.962
<i>was changed by her story,</i>

1:44:14.964 --> 1:44:16.596
<i>then it would've
all been worth it.</i>

1:44:16.598 --> 1:44:17.632
<i>Just one.</i>

1:44:20.669 --> 1:44:21.936
<i>So, this one's for her.</i>

1:44:34.616 --> 1:44:40.122

1:47:17.980 --> 1:47:20.850
I feel like I knew her,
your wife.

1:47:22.418 --> 1:47:23.651
Melissa.

1:47:25.988 --> 1:47:27.821
I was there the night
that you prayed over her.

1:47:27.823 --> 1:47:29.358
We were the next band.

1:47:30.893 --> 1:47:33.026
I'd just gotten in
from South Africa

1:47:33.028 --> 1:47:36.298
and I was, uh,
going through a really hard time.

1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:41.101
And I honestly
was trapped

1:47:41.103 --> 1:47:45.107
in this web of, like,
apathy and disappointment.

1:47:48.177 --> 1:47:51.914
I had lost someone
close to me.

1:47:54.383 --> 1:47:56.685
I was angry
and hurt and...

1:47:58.487 --> 1:48:00.821
I thought the world
was full of hypocrites

1:48:00.823 --> 1:48:03.058
and I was the worst of them.

1:48:04.793 --> 1:48:06.929
I guess
I just wanted to know

1:48:08.497 --> 1:48:12.868
that God was real,
somewhere in the universe,

1:48:15.804 --> 1:48:17.938
like, to a person.

1:48:17.940 --> 1:48:21.210
An actual person in an
actual, meaningful way.

1:48:22.745 --> 1:48:23.877
And I looked at her,

1:48:23.879 --> 1:48:25.913
your wife, that night.

1:48:25.915 --> 1:48:29.885
She was, like, glowing

1:48:31.754 --> 1:48:33.956
with something
I've never had.

1:48:35.090 --> 1:48:36.926
Her story
and your story, it...

1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:39.795
It rescued me.

1:48:45.301 --> 1:48:46.802
I'm the one

1:48:48.938 --> 1:48:50.873
whose life was changed.

1:48:51.974 --> 1:48:54.143
And there will be
millions more.

1:48:58.214 --> 1:49:00.015
I just wanted you
to know that.

1:49:01.183 --> 1:49:02.184
Thank you.

1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:05.754
It means a lot.

1:49:14.063 --> 1:49:15.529
Hey.

1:49:15.531 --> 1:49:16.899
What's your name, again?

1:49:18.133 --> 1:49:19.134
Adrienne.

1:49:56.171 --> 1:49:57.806
You were right.

1:49:59.608 --> 1:50:01.510
I've never seen stars
like this before.

1:50:06.315 --> 1:50:07.483
I love you, Melissa.

1:50:10.286 --> 1:50:11.487
And I'm gonna tell your story.

1:50:52.194 --> 1:50:53.527
<i>I feel very protective</i>

1:50:53.529 --> 1:50:54.628
<i>of Jeremy and Melissa's story,</i>

1:50:54.630 --> 1:50:56.463
<i>I think, because of how much</i>

1:50:56.465 --> 1:50:58.265
<i>the Lord did in my life.</i>

1:50:58.267 --> 1:51:00.536
<i>That it was something
that I needed to hear.</i>

1:51:03.172 --> 1:51:05.372
<i>God was telling me to
pick my guitar up, and I'm like,</i>

1:51:05.374 --> 1:51:06.907
<i>"The last I wanna do
is pick my guitar up."</i>

1:51:06.909 --> 1:51:11.044
<i>I remember feeling the presence
of God so thick in that room.</i>

1:51:11.046 --> 1:51:13.380
<i>Like, just, like,
I needed that.</i>

1:51:13.382 --> 1:51:17.119
<i>Right what came out was just,</i>

1:51:18.053 --> 1:51:19.219
<i>"Okay. I still believe."</i>

1:51:19.221 --> 1:51:22.556
<i>Literally. Like,
"I still believe in You."</i>

1:51:22.558 --> 1:51:25.325
<i>That's what I wanted to say.</i>

1:51:25.327 --> 1:51:27.928
<i>This is something that God
gave me as a gift to heal me,</i>

1:51:27.930 --> 1:51:30.399
<i>and I believe that God was gonna
use it to heal many people.</i>
