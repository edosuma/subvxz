Monroe: Previously on Revolution...

00:04.680 --> 00:05.750
Mr. President.

00:05.920 --> 00:09.117
I need you, Tom, to hunt
down Monroe and execute him.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.118
What makes you so sure
you can trust me?

00:11.320 --> 00:13.755
Your wife, alive, for now.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.550
Miles, Rachel. You gotta know
about these Patriots, right?

00:17.720 --> 00:18.790
I have been fighting
like hell against them.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.156
- Your old man telling the truth?
- On my mother's grave.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.310
Nanotech?

00:22.480 --> 00:24.756
It's OS.
It's the code that we all wrote.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.349
And the fireflies,
the healing, it's all part of it.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.715
We're here because it wants us here,

00:28.920 --> 00:31.230
and we're gonna stay
until we figure out why.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.277
These guys are handing
our asses to us.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.080
We need more men.
I know someone who's got plenty,

00:36.240 --> 00:37.913
<i>a warlord named Duncan Page.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:41.072
- I want to buy some of your guys.
- Thirty diamonds a head.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.072
You want those men?
We need those diamonds.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.437

while you guys make your move.</i>

Hey, you!

02:24.880 --> 02:29.670
Imagine my surprise when
I found out that this whole time

02:29.840 --> 02:32.434
you were the Sebastian Monroe.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.352
Oh, is...
This is your son?

02:40.240 --> 02:42.959
Huh.
I see the resemblance.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.718
Sebastian Monroe?

02:46.240 --> 02:48.038
What the hell
are you talking about, Gould?

02:48.200 --> 02:51.875
I guess the mighty have fallen
pretty frickin' far, huh?

02:52.040 --> 02:54.190
I mean, stealing?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.720
From me?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.437
You wanted money,
all you had to do was ask.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.079
I would've whored you out.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.711
- Okay, Gould, let me explain.
- No, no, it's okay.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.400
You can make it up to me, General.

03:08.440 --> 03:12.229
You and him...
You're gonna have a dogfight.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.674
Son of a...

03:15.560 --> 03:19.190
Gould, don't. Let's just...
Let's talk about this.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.558
None of this sounds good.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.358
It's a fight to the death.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.830
Don't look at it as a bad thing.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.309
The winner gets to walk away.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.636
And I get a hell of a payday.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.991
Almost everybody wins.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.440
(GRUNTING)

03:44.600 --> 03:47.911
Now, you're gonna open this gate,
and we're walking away.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.478
Don't get hysterical.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.669
They got you covered.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.111
You wouldn't make it two steps.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.789
Now let me go,
or I shoot your son.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.630
You're fighting tomorrow.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.910
And you know me,
I got a good eye.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.314
So if either one
of you tries to throw it,

04:35.480 --> 04:38.518
or if it even smells like
you're pulling your punches...

04:41.240 --> 04:43.629
...I'll shoot both of you
on the spot.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.477
And the crowd will love it.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.478
How are we gonna get out of here?

04:57.600 --> 05:01.480
Well, you got any ideas?
I'm all ears.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.274
- Charlie's still out there.
- Right, yeah, mini-Miles.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.556
She's gonna come and save us?

05:09.760 --> 05:11.558
Let's just hold our breath.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.990
Well, if we can't get out of here...

05:19.400 --> 05:21.755
...we gotta get ready.
We don't have much time.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.473
Ready for what?

05:29.360 --> 05:31.510
I gotta teach you how to kill me.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.597
(FAINT CHATTERING)

05:52.880 --> 05:54.791
Tom: I thought you said
this was a field hospital.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.198
It was.
Looks like they're renovating.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.079
Tom: Into what?

06:02.920 --> 06:04.911
Oh, probably something terrible.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.559
Aren't you glad you joined the team?

06:07.760 --> 06:09.990
Having a second thought or two.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.393
What do you think's in those barrels?

06:22.440 --> 06:23.953
Who's that guy?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.832
Giving orders.
Ever seen him before?

06:30.760 --> 06:32.637
Torn!

06:35.600 --> 06:37.113
No.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.873
But if we want to find
out what they're up to,

06:40.080 --> 06:42.117
he looks like
a pretty good place to start.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.953
I say we pick him up,
have ourselves a little chat.

- I just came to talk to Duncan.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.358
Duncan: What's this?

07:20.520 --> 07:23.990
It's Monroe's bitch.
I remember you.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.992
Where are my diamonds?

07:29.160 --> 07:30.958
There's been a little delay.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.999
Really?
Where's Monroe?

07:34.160 --> 07:36.037
Yeah, that's the delay.
Umm...

07:36.160 --> 07:37.958
(CLEARS THROAT)
Gould's got him.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.149
Gould?

07:39.320 --> 07:41.311
Yeah, well, where'd you think
we were gonna get the diamonds from?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.989
(SCOFFS) Thought if you were
dumb enough to rob Gould for 'em,

07:44.040 --> 07:46.350
you at least wouldn't be
dumb enough to get caught.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.079
Look, just help me spring Monroe,

07:48.240 --> 07:50.117
and I'll get you your stones, okay?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.437
You made a real big
mess for me, little girl.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.557
I'm not gonna go make it any worse.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.670
You and Monroe,
you guys had something, right?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.032
If you don't help me
he will die.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.679
I can't do this alone.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.591
Or...
I have a better idea.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.919
Really?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.110
(SIGHS)
It is a curious question.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.232
What is Doyle doing
way out here in the sticks?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.710
He's building a reeducation center.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.351
You want to know what's
in those barrels?

08:45.520 --> 08:47.477
Nothing.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.119
Know what's going inside them?

08:49.680 --> 08:50.909
Cadets.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.751
When we were punished,
that's where they'd put us.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.390
Seventeen, 18 hours at a stretch.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.914
You think we have
much of a choice here?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.037
This is the guy that took Mom.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.956
Probably having her
beaten every day or worse.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.189
Unclench yourself.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.359
Our job is to find Monroe
and kill him, remember?

09:14.400 --> 09:16.914
This is not about you.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.593
It's about your mother.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.558
You trust the two of them?

09:37.520 --> 09:39.193
Still pulling the knife
out of my back

09:39.360 --> 09:41.317
from the last time Tom put it there.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.676
Then why are we doing this?

09:43.840 --> 09:47.799
Because if there's even
a chance they're on the level,

09:47.960 --> 09:49.837
it would be a good score for us.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.116
Listen, when we
go grab this Patriot guy,

09:55.320 --> 09:56.799
you gotta stay behind, okay?

09:56.960 --> 10:01.397
And if Neville is up to something,
and you're out there alone with him?

10:02.240 --> 10:05.119
Then I will have
to move fast and violent,

10:05.280 --> 10:08.477
and that's gonna be a lot
easier to do if you're not around.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.991
What if he puts a gun to your head?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.837

- What?

- Did you see something?
- My father.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.874
He said, "Save us."

What does that mean?

This is something no one knows,
not even Miles, all right?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.313
But right here...

12:50.960 --> 12:53.156
I got a blind spot right here.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.233
No peripheral vision in my left eye.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.878
I got too close to a grenade.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.396
That's why I always push
my opponents to the right.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.471
Okay?
To the right.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.154
So you're gonna come
at me this time from the left.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.360
Go again.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.038
I said go again!

13:17.880 --> 13:19.632
This is insane.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.600
We should just
make a run at the guards.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.320
Wow, run at the guards or something?

13:26.480 --> 13:30.314
How did you think of such
a brilliant strategy, huh?

13:30.480 --> 13:33.120
Even if we could get
through this fence,

13:33.280 --> 13:36.557
which we can't, or over this wire,

13:36.720 --> 13:38.916
which we can't,
we got six douche bags

13:39.080 --> 13:40.832
with rifles ready to kill us.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.991
Isn't that right, huh?

13:43.160 --> 13:44.992
Think.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.717
The only way you're
gonna get out of here

13:48.880 --> 13:52.760
is to take me down, for real.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.877
No pulled punches.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.951
Gould's gonna know.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.154
Screw Gould!

13:59.320 --> 14:01.914
I'm not gonna kill you so
that he can get his rocks off.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.720
- Then you're gonna die.
- Better to die on my feet

14:04.880 --> 14:06.553
than bend over for some psycho!

14:06.720 --> 14:08.631
No! Listen to me!

14:16.800 --> 14:18.711
You should want to, you know.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.193
You should want to kill me.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.313
And why is that?

14:29.480 --> 14:32.074
Because I got your mom killed.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.875
Excuse me?

14:40.160 --> 14:42.800
I dragged her right out into gunfire.

She got shot.

She bled out.

You're lying.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.959
That's the truth.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.150
So how do you feel
about your old man now?

15:28.160 --> 15:30.549
(GRUNTING AGGRESSIVELY)

16:07.400 --> 16:10.199
Well, it's short on cover,
but it'll do.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.559
He rolls by, we'll hit him
from here and over there.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.953
Jason will flank the rest.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.476
- Yeah, that'll work.
- Got to admit, quite a team.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.832
Uhh... no, I don't.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.031
I never liked you, Tom.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.713
I'm sure the feeling's mutual.

16:30.440 --> 16:34.911
But Julia dying, I'm sure that...
That couldn't have been easy for you.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.758
I won't lie to you.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.718
There's nothing I wouldn't
do to see her face again.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.509
I scouted a better spot.
It's 100 yards up.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.840
More coverage.
It's a better vantage.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.877
Attaboy, nipples.
Let's go check it out.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.553
Oh, and by the way,

16:50.720 --> 16:52.040
I'm glad you finally got together

16:52.200 --> 16:55.033
with your sister-in-law, sicko.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.757

17:22.280 --> 17:25.511
Oh, so we're all just pals again?

17:26.640 --> 17:28.550
Look, I am sorry, okay?
I had to keep you here.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.633
It wanted you here.
Now we know why.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.834
It's the code. There's something
wrong with the code.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.638
We may have made a mistake
with the code we wrote.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.438
One of the recursive
algorithms, maybe.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.433
- Aaron.
- It's Peter.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.031
You don't think he's figured it out?

17:51.400 --> 17:52.959
If we did,
the problem will replicate,

17:53.120 --> 17:54.679
like a cancer,
and it may take years,

17:54.880 --> 17:58.111
but eventually,
the nano will corrupt and die.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.998
We are so blessed.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.113
How's that?

18:10.200 --> 18:13.591
Everything that's
happened to us, for months...

18:13.760 --> 18:15.478
It's all led us to this moment,

18:15.640 --> 18:18.029
so that we could fix it.
Save it.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.436
How exactly do you propose
we do that?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.876
There aren't a lot of computers
around, last time I looked.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.917
You have to have faith, Aaron.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.118
And if we say no?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.231
- What?
- If we refuse to help?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.871
You don't have a choice.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.229
That's why we're here.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.918
You can't fight fate.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.233
It's a machine, Pete.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.837
It's not God.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.713
It is better than God.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.389
The nano, it's alive.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.200
It answers our prayers.
It heals.

This is a new age.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.032
This is a new God.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.713
You're insane.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.870
And I won't help.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.715
This thing is too powerful,
and I want it to die.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.356
Look, you're my friends.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.315
Please don't make me do
anything I don't want to do.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.996
Don't be stupid.
You need your energy.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.549
Look, I'm sorry about your mom.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.159
For what it's worth...

20:08.120 --> 20:09.349
...I loved her.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.353
It's not worth much.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.839
I agree with you.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.600
To tell you the truth,
it's not just her.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.392
I've hurt a lot of people.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.316
I have clawed,
killed my way to the front of the pack,

20:33.480 --> 20:36.359
and when I got there,
it didn't mean a damn thing...

20:38.720 --> 20:40.313
...'cause I was alone.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.959
What was the point?

20:52.560 --> 20:55.313
That's why I need you
to make it out of here.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.113
I need you to get the Republic back,

20:59.280 --> 21:02.079
because then all the terrible
things that I've clone...

21:04.800 --> 21:07.076
...they'll mean something,
you know?

21:07.280 --> 21:09.112
Something bigger than me.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.474
That's worth dying over, for sure.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.990
I'm begging you to do this.

get me 1,000 diamonds.</i>

22:09.480 --> 22:11.357
I didn't know he was
gonna steal those from you.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.955
Well, I appreciate
you letting me know.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.791
And this is a token.

high and low for you.

any fights with you,

22:35.160 --> 22:36.753

Of course.
No hard feelings.

Oh, there's a...
There's a dogfight tonight,

a lot of use out of you.

So much for that rescue.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.993
Tonight at the fight,

24:03.160 --> 24:04.434
and take the bitch out.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.194
- Man: <i>Yes, sir.
- Gould: Please.</i>

24:07.360 --> 24:10.079
Duncan didn't know about the heist?

24:10.240 --> 24:11.878
Only 'cause it went to hell.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.596

actually thinking of helping.

Look, I'm with you.

24:36.680 --> 24:41.311
This thing isn't God,
Peter is nuts, but he is also right.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.039
- There's barely a difference.
- Aaron!

24:43.200 --> 24:47.194
Forget what he's going to do,
think about what it can do.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.351
The nano is listening.
It's watching us.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.433
Which is why we should let it die.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.511
I am not afraid of it!

24:55.920 --> 24:57.513
No one is gonna threaten me.
