- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.671 --> 00:05.273
sexually based offenses

00:05.306 --> 00:07.108
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.542
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.576 --> 00:10.444
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.478 --> 00:12.180
are members of an elite squad

00:12.213 --> 00:13.781
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.783
These are their stories.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.458

00:24.492 --> 00:26.760
All right,
I will see you later.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.828
[kisses]

00:27.861 --> 00:29.263
both: Adios.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.202
- I love you.
- Adios.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.569
- Bye.
Bye, papi.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.770
- Bye, sweetie.
- Adios, mi amor.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.539
- Bye, sweetie.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.573
Bye.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.311
- I don't wanna go.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.279
- Come on, Noah.
School is fun, right?

00:45.313 --> 00:47.681
You got Teddy with you.
You're all good.

00:47.715 --> 00:52.520
- Lucy wouldn't make me go.
I wish she was my mommy.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.754
- What did you say?

00:53.787 --> 00:56.424
- I wish Lucy
was my mommy.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.595
- Well, kiddo, looks like
you're stuck with me.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.466
[cell phone rings]

01:05.499 --> 01:06.534
Hold on, babe.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.570
Just give me a second.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.604
Benson.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.506
What?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.408
Okay.
Yes?

01:14.442 --> 01:15.509
Noah!

01:15.543 --> 01:17.711
Watch out!
[tires screech]

01:17.745 --> 01:19.213
[horn blares]

01:19.247 --> 01:21.315
- [crying] Mommy!

01:21.349 --> 01:23.784
- Noah.
It's okay, baby.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.453
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.520
You're okay.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.356
You're okay, my love.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.257
You're okay.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.292
Oh, honey.
You're okay.

[cell phone rings]

02:03.624 --> 02:04.792
- Benson.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.460
Yes?

02:06.494 --> 02:08.296
What?
Is he okay?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.501
Uh, no.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.269
Uh, no, I'm sure.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.938
If Noah was bruised,

02:17.971 --> 02:19.873
I definitely would have
noticed it.

02:19.907 --> 02:23.244
Is he okay?
Is he in pain?

02:23.277 --> 02:27.481
Okay, so maybe
it was another student.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.617
Okay, well,
maybe he just fell.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.918

02:36.257 --> 02:38.892
Uh, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.394
- Guess what I caught.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.929
A couple of snapper,
a sailfish,

02:41.962 --> 02:44.265
and one fat-assed flounder.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.666
- Damn.
- Bottom feeder, huh?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.501
- Raped three women
that we know about,

02:47.535 --> 02:48.936
and then he bolted
before we could arrest him.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.538
- Most people just
call me Byron.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.540
- Didn't I tell you
to shut your face?

02:52.573 --> 02:55.243
The whole way home,
he's yapping about old times.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.278
- Detective Benson.
How are you?

02:57.311 --> 02:58.746
- A lot better now.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.349
I hope.
- Yeah.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.283
There he was just
strolling down the pier

03:02.316 --> 03:03.551
in Havana.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.253
Didn't even put up a fight.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.455
- Okay.
Interrogation one.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.856
- I look forward
to catching up.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.326
*

03:12.360 --> 03:13.961
Sand and sun.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.563
Cuba.
What's not to like?

03:15.596 --> 03:16.730
They should put that
on their travel posters.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.532
- Oh, yeah.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.401
You know, personally,
I find it morally reprehensible

03:20.434 --> 03:21.435
that an American would give
a nickel to the Castros.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.637
- The people, detective.

03:23.671 --> 03:27.608
With all they've been through,
they still have hope and heart.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.277
My wife, my child.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.645
[laughs]
I'd show you photos, but--

03:31.679 --> 03:35.316
- We're a little lacking
in heart at the moment.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.684
- You never quite
understood me.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.218
- I never wanted to.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.357
- Did I tell you how much
I missed you, Detective Benson?

03:43.391 --> 03:44.358
- It's Lieutenant.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.926
- Good for you.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.262
- You missed me so much,
maybe you shouldn't have run.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.864
- Ah, well, when
the wanderlust strikes,

03:50.898 --> 03:52.433
a man simply has no choice.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.734
- And the three women
that you raped,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.603
they didn't have
much choice, either.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.306
- This is what makes
life worth living.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.740
The verbal give and take,
the push and pull;

03:59.773 --> 04:02.910
the heave and ho
keeps a man on his toes.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.545
- Well, had you stuck around
for another 24 hours,

04:04.578 --> 04:07.781
you'd know that
your DNA matches

04:07.815 --> 04:09.383
all three victims.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.018
- I've always had
a good sense of timing.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.886
- I should wipe that smug
right off your face.

04:12.920 --> 04:17.925
You shattered the lives
of three innocent human beings.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.427
- And I suppose your
sanctimonious crap

04:19.460 --> 04:20.528
fills their days...
- Okay.

04:20.561 --> 04:23.631
- With sunshine and light!

04:23.664 --> 04:24.665
Now, let me guess.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.966
You sent them cards
on Christmas

04:25.999 --> 04:28.902
for two years.
Three, tops.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.704
But then you got
a little busy.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.039
Who doesn't?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.641
So you said to yourself,
"You know what?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.343
"I'll make sure I hit
their birthdays this year.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345
They'll appreciate
that more."

04:37.378 --> 04:39.380
But this and that came up.

04:39.413 --> 04:43.717
A PBA conference here,
a co-op meeting there.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.620
And these three devastated
human beings disappeared

04:46.654 --> 04:49.790
from your thoughts
like a puff of smoke

04:49.823 --> 04:51.725
in a windstorm.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.065
What the hell?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.667
The sun will
come up tomorrow,

04:59.700 --> 05:03.571
and you'll have another victim
or two to empty

05:03.604 --> 05:08.942
that goopy stuff you're pouring
out of your heart.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.612
- You done?

05:11.645 --> 05:12.880
- For now.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.415
- 'Cause it seems like
you've really given that

05:14.448 --> 05:15.816
a lot of thought.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.852
- Well, thanks to you,
I've had a lot of time.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.523
- So, we've got you cold,
Mr. Marks.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.559
How about you confess, hmm?

05:25.593 --> 05:29.830
Save us all
a lot of time?

05:29.863 --> 05:34.435
- I suppose this is where
I ask for a lawyer.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.537
- What happened to
the old heave and ho?

05:36.570 --> 05:39.807
- Time and place, detective.
Time and place.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.750
[dramatic music]

05:49.783 --> 05:56.824
*

06:33.226 --> 06:35.062
- Is there a
limitations problem?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.730
- The rapes were forcible.
He used an eight-inch blade.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.998
- He fled the jurisdiction

06:38.031 --> 06:39.700
before the lab could test
his DNA.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.134
- Are there any problems
with the arrest?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.003
- I thought we were supposed
to be on the same team.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.838
- Do you know how many
six-year-old cases dry up,

06:44.872 --> 06:46.173
turn to dust,
and blow to the four corners

06:46.206 --> 06:47.841
by a reasonably competent
defense attorney?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.610
- Not this one.
- Okay.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.480
So Byron Marks met his vics
at various farmers' markets.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.148
He charmed them, he,
you know, carried their bags--

06:55.182 --> 06:56.784
- Then the charming
son of a bitch

06:56.817 --> 06:58.151
threatened to cut their
breasts off

06:58.185 --> 07:00.053
if they didn't enjoy
their afternoon.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.656
- Lovely.
Tell me how you caught him.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.792
- I was on vacation
in Havana.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.460
Marks didn't resist.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.195
After I related his CV
to the local authorities,

07:08.228 --> 07:11.865
they were happy to assist me
in bringing him home.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.133
- You buying that?

07:13.166 --> 07:14.802
- I am.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.138
- I'll arraign the bastard.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.207
Reopen the case.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.112
*

07:25.779 --> 07:27.147
- It was so long ago.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.883
- Honestly, I thought
you would have, um,

07:29.917 --> 07:31.251
reacted differently.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.120
- I thought so too.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.922
Maybe you shouldn't have,
I don't know,

07:34.955 --> 07:36.757
gone to the trouble.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.827
- Marks forced you to have sex
with him at knifepoint.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.163
- Look, it's my problem,
and I'll live with it.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.766
Just like I have to live
with everything every day.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.101
I know I don't
mean much to people.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.770
You know it too; it's why it
took you six years

07:49.803 --> 07:51.138
to get around to my case.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.040
- No, but we never
stopped looking for him.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.644
- You shouldn't have
wasted your time.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.711
- We can subpoena you.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.147
- You know what, Joyce?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.283
Thank you.
We'll be going now.

08:03.316 --> 08:09.923
*

08:09.957 --> 08:12.593
- Good shot, Khalil!

08:12.626 --> 08:14.127
And his daddy played
junior college.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.997
- Oh.
- He ran off.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.131
I can't even blame him.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.833
I mean,
if I were a man,

08:19.867 --> 08:21.301
why would I wanna
be with someone--

08:21.334 --> 08:24.071
- You were sexually assaulted
by an animal, Keesha.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.541
That has nothing
to do with you.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.810
- That's what the lady doctor
at the ER said.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.713
That's what
Detective Benson said.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.582
What you said.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.684
Easy words to say,
but you all get

08:36.717 --> 08:38.251
to go home at night.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.689
The next day, you move on
to the next case.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.692
Truth is, words are useless
without time.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.226
A lot of time.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.828
- We need you
to testify.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.098
- No way that's
gonna happen.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.834
Things are good
for me now.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.102
I'm not gonna let
that man take up

08:55.135 --> 08:57.838
any more of the time
I got left.

08:57.871 --> 09:02.075
*

09:02.109 --> 09:03.677
- Tell me that
doesn't piss you off.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.878
We finally catch this prick,
and they tell us

09:04.912 --> 09:06.313
that we wasted our time?

09:06.346 --> 09:08.248
- Marks was one
of my first cases at SVU,

09:08.281 --> 09:12.252
and he still--he still ranks
on my top ten despicable list.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.054
- Makes him a lot scummier
than I thought.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.723
- Yeah, and he was one of
the first stops

09:15.756 --> 09:16.957
in this investigation,

09:16.990 --> 09:20.060
and I...
I knock on his door,

09:20.093 --> 09:21.995
and he invites me in,

09:22.029 --> 09:25.833
and he makes me feel, like,
completely at home.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.134
- Yeah, with the fake charm,
and the--

09:27.167 --> 09:28.268
- No, but see, that's it.
It's not fake.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.369
It's real.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.739
I mean, he really
is that charming.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.874
[laughs]

09:33.907 --> 09:35.743
You know, he was so charming,

09:35.776 --> 09:37.110
I could have invited him back

09:37.144 --> 09:39.179
to meet mom and dad
after a high school dance.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.618
Yeah, I could have been
one of those women.

09:44.652 --> 09:45.953
I got a badge and a gun.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.022
And still, that bastard changed

09:49.056 --> 09:51.659
the way I look
at the world.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.931
*

09:58.932 --> 09:59.566
- Please don't tell me
he's dead.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.002
- No, Karla.
We got him.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.204
- Who's there?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.073
- An early Christmas present.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.916
- All right, in here?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.785
- They're cops.
- Uh...

10:17.818 --> 10:20.053
- They're here about that thing
I told you about.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.791
The rape, baby.
They caught the bastard.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.225
- Whoop-di-doo.

10:25.258 --> 10:28.261
- Okay, so,
we are gonna reopen the case.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.031
And, you know, Karla, with
your testimony, we really--

10:31.064 --> 10:32.365
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.201
- No, no.
It's how it works, Frank.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.103
Without the evidence,
they've got no case.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.938
I am the case.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.406
- Not anymore,
you're not.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.374
- Excuse me, sir,
but this is not your decision.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.678
- She's my wife.
That makes it my decision.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.246
Like I'm gonna let her
embarrass us in front

10:46.279 --> 10:47.981
of Mikey and Joe
and the guys?

10:48.015 --> 10:49.249
- I want him in prison.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.184
- And I don't
want you humiliated.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.786
There were other girls, right?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.022
- Right--
- And if so, go let them do it.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.957
- Actually,
Karla's all we've got.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.726
- You see, baby?

10:58.759 --> 11:01.061
Those girls got their heads
screwed on right.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.095
Nobody wants their name
in the paper,

11:02.129 --> 11:03.396
their face on the news.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.265
- But that's not
what we're talking about.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.900
We're talking about
what's best for you, Karla.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.468
I--I know what
you went through.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.237
- Maybe he's right.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.172
- Well, maybe the light
in the refrigerator

11:12.205 --> 11:15.075
stays on when I shut the door,
but I wouldn't bet on it.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.978
- Frank knows what's right.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.813
- You can let
yourselves out.

11:19.847 --> 11:26.820
*

11:29.489 --> 11:31.258
- An oh-fer.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.126
We'd have better luck starting
the Byron Marks fan club.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.728
- Look, it's upsetting,
but it's not surprising.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.396
- Yeah, I tried
to explain that to him.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.265
- Look, I know. I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm Italian.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.267
Revenge is one
of our three major food groups.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.336
- Well, we've got the grand jury
testimony from six years ago.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.272
- Right, and it's hearsay,
and it's worthless.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.075
So let's let it sink in
for a couple of days,

11:48.108 --> 11:50.143
and then I'll talk to them.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.745
- Six years,
they've done all the thinking

11:51.779 --> 11:53.446
they're gonna do.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.348
- Looks like you shouldn't
have blown your vacation.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.451
- How much fish can you eat?

11:58.485 --> 11:59.719
- Fin.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.991
Are you still sticking
to the coincidence story?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.759
- No reason
to change it now.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.327
- You know, I just find it
a little hard to believe,

12:07.360 --> 12:10.363
that with all the police
and the FBI resources,

12:10.397 --> 12:14.467
plus the U.S. Marshals,
that you happen to just stumble

12:14.501 --> 12:17.170
upon Marks sitting
on a pier in Havana.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.039
- I'd rather
be lucky than good.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.142
- So what shocks me is that
he didn't put up a fight.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.244
- I may have had a little help.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.113
- Should I ask who?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.081
- Better you don't.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.218
- [sighs]

12:32.953 --> 12:33.921
Karla.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.890
*

12:36.924 --> 12:37.925
Karla.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.028
I'm surprised to see you.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.263
- I'll testify.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.833
- I thought your husband
said he didn't want--

12:45.866 --> 12:47.167
- Screw him.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.268
I want to nail
that son of a bitch.

12:57.177 --> 12:57.310
.

12:57.344 --> 12:57.777
- Case ending 90056.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.814
"People v. Marks, Byron T."

13:00.848 --> 13:02.549
Charge is rape in the
first degree, one count.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.851
- How do you plead?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.285
- If I may, Your Honor.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.021
Exactly which people
are we talking about?

13:08.055 --> 13:09.256
I know that we're not
talking about me.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.891
I just met Mr. Marks.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.026
Can't be you.
That would be patently unfair.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.828
- Very funny, Mr.--

13:14.862 --> 13:16.296
- Dworkin, Randolph J.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.531
I know Mr. Barba doesn't
much care for my client.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.267
- Recall the case,
Mr. Goldberg.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.469
This time with a little
more specificity.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.339
- "The People of the State of
New York vs. Marks, Byron T."

13:26.373 --> 13:28.175
- That's a lot of people.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.610
Wow, you must be a real S.O.B.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.213
- Can I assume your client
is pleading Not Guilty?

13:33.246 --> 13:34.481
- Gee, I don't know.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.249
With 20 million people
against him,

13:36.283 --> 13:37.450
can they all be wrong?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.386
- [whispers]
- What can I say?

13:39.419 --> 13:42.389
My client is more
of a gambler than I am.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.191
- Not Guilty,
Your Honor.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.192
- The People request
the defendant be held

13:45.225 --> 13:46.459
without bail.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.195
- Mr. Dworkin?
- I don't know.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.930
I'm still hung up on that
20 million people.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.331
- You really should get
some new material, Mr. Dworkin.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.000
This is merely
an arraignment.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.634
- Do you oppose
the People's request

13:54.667 --> 13:57.304
to hold your client
without bail?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.206
- I oppose this
entire proceeding,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.541
but I'll settle for
my client being released

14:01.574 --> 14:03.043
on his own recognizance.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.044
- He's a violent felon
who's already fled

14:04.077 --> 14:05.345
the jurisdiction once.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.014
- The People's request
is granted.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.116
The defendant is remanded.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.221
- Since when do you
come to an arraignment?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.455
- I just wanted to make sure
it sticks this time.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.157
What was that clown show
in there?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.325
- Randy Dworkin's
anything but a clown.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.127
- I never heard of him.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.029
- That's because he spends most
of his time in Federal Court,

14:22.062 --> 14:23.263
which is appropriate,

14:23.296 --> 14:24.898
considering he clerked
for Scalia.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.100
- So why would a guy like that
defend a scumbag

14:27.134 --> 14:28.601
like Marks in state court?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.637
- That's what worries me.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.239
*

14:32.272 --> 14:35.108
- So, he has a bruise.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.376
He's a kid.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.245
- Yeah, I'm just
following the rules.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.047
- Of course,
but I'm--I'm sorry,

14:40.080 --> 14:42.115
I thought we--I thought
we cleared this up yesterday.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.117
- We did, but, um,
the school nurse

14:44.151 --> 14:45.585
questioned Noah.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.254
- Yes, and he said
that it was nothing.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.956
- Actually, he didn't.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.360
Look, there's no easy
way to say this,

14:53.393 --> 14:55.162
Lieutenant Benson,

14:55.195 --> 14:57.931
but Noah says
you gave him the bruises.

14:57.965 --> 15:02.202
- I'm sorry?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.570
Noah said that I
gave him the bruise--

15:03.603 --> 15:06.106
I'm--I find that
a little hard to believe.

15:06.139 --> 15:12.012
- Your job--
it must be stressful.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.280
- Uh, yes.
It is, actually.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.948
Very stressful.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.684
And I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

15:17.717 --> 15:21.955
- It's just that, you know,
stress can cause people

15:21.989 --> 15:23.957
to act out physically.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.393
- [sighs] Oh.

15:29.462 --> 15:34.434
Wow.
Um, Mrs. Smiley, I'm--

15:34.467 --> 15:39.973
I can assure you that
I am not one of those people.

15:40.007 --> 15:44.577
This is a big misunderstanding
and a miscommunication.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.348
- Well, tell me about
Noah's father, then.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.686
- He is deceased.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.255
- I'm sorry to hear that.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.693
He does care a lot for Lucy.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.429
- Yes, who is his nanny.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.031
What's not to like?

16:10.637 --> 16:14.007
Uh, please don't go where
I think you're going with this.

16:14.041 --> 16:19.112
All I can say to you is that
this is a huge misunderstanding

16:19.146 --> 16:21.748
and a huge mis--
miscommunication.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.283
And--
and I--

16:23.316 --> 16:25.618
- You're probably right.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.620
I just had to
see it for myself.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.489
- Yeah.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.092
- I'm sure you understand.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.360
- [laughs]

16:33.393 --> 16:39.632
*

16:39.666 --> 16:41.501
Oh, damn it.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.136
- Maybe you've had
enough of that?

16:43.170 --> 16:45.638
- It's not the caffeine.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.207
- You need somebody
to listen?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.441
- I can handle it.
I--

16:48.475 --> 16:50.277
- Sure, you can,
but sometimes--

16:50.310 --> 16:53.580
- Here.
I got it, thanks.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.014
- You okay?

16:58.418 --> 17:01.421
- I got called in
to Noah's school today

17:01.454 --> 17:04.257
about this mysterious
bruise on his arm.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.526
- Maybe he fell
off the swings.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.295
- That's what I said,
but apparently Noah

17:08.328 --> 17:12.699
told the school nurse
a different story.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.134
- Noah said that you--

17:14.167 --> 17:15.402
- Yeah.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.536
I have no idea what's going on.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.438
I don't know if he's mad,

17:18.471 --> 17:23.310
if he's acting out, but...

17:23.343 --> 17:24.677
- I'm sure it's nothing.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.747
- Yeah, me too.
It's just so weird.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.316
The whole time she's
asking me questions,

17:29.349 --> 17:31.318
all I could think of is,

17:31.351 --> 17:32.852
"I'm the one who
asks the questions."

17:32.885 --> 17:35.088
- Hmm.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.759
[soft music]

17:39.792 --> 17:43.230
*

17:43.263 --> 17:44.831
You know you're
a good mom, Liv.

17:44.864 --> 17:49.636
So if anyone says different,
they'll have to answer to me.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.171
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.473
- Where's Fin?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.375
- He's gone for the night.
Why?

17:55.408 --> 18:01.414
- Well, I just found out why he
showed up at Marks' arraignment.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.317
So, uh, Defense counsel,
the always entertaining

18:04.351 --> 18:05.718
Randy Dworkin,
just filed a Motion

18:05.752 --> 18:07.720
to dismiss the charges
against Byron Marks.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.457
- Is it viable?
- I don't know.

18:10.490 --> 18:14.461
Did Detective Tutuola kidnap
Mr. Marks or not?

18:14.494 --> 18:17.764
- What if he did?

18:17.797 --> 18:19.899
- We're screwed.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.440
.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.641
- The arresting officer traveled
to another sovereign country,

18:30.610 --> 18:32.279
invaded its sovereign borders,
and grabbed up a resident

18:32.312 --> 18:33.813
in violation
of its sovereign laws.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.249
- Counsel failed to mention
that the resident in question

18:36.283 --> 18:37.650
is a serial rapist.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.586
- I don't know that.
You don't know that.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.289
Nobody knows what he is
until 12 ordinary citizens

18:42.322 --> 18:43.856
sitting in that box tell us.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.925
- Great, so let them tell us.
That's what we want, a trial.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.360
- Aha, there's the rub.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.928
Tell me,
how can an indisputably

18:48.961 --> 18:50.830
illegal act performed
in another country

18:50.863 --> 18:54.334
by an American police officer
magically give birth

18:54.367 --> 18:55.902
to a valid trial here?

18:55.935 --> 18:58.205
If Detective Tutuola did
what he did in New Jersey--

18:58.238 --> 18:59.806
or Brooklyn, even--
it would be considered

18:59.839 --> 19:01.241
an illegal arrest,
and the entire mess

19:01.274 --> 19:02.842
would be tossed.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.777
- You're saying I should
put Detective Tutuola on trial?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.613
- No, Your Honor.
I'm saying this court

19:06.646 --> 19:08.815
doesn't have jurisdiction
to hear this case at all.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.850
- Mr. Dworkin's heartfelt
argument notwithstanding,

19:10.883 --> 19:13.686
the Ker-Frisbie line of cases
holds that the manner in which

19:13.720 --> 19:16.223
a person is brought into
a jurisdiction is irrelevant

19:16.256 --> 19:18.558
as to whether the court
has the power to try him.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.627
- I see your Ker-Frisbie
line of cases,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.929
and raise you one
"US v. Toscanino,"

19:22.962 --> 19:26.533
which held that the court should
divest itself of jurisdiction

19:26.566 --> 19:28.735
following an illegal capture
on foreign soil.

19:28.768 --> 19:33.240
- If the defendant was tortured
before being brought home.

19:33.273 --> 19:37.377
- As to that,
I'll hear testimony tomorrow.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.346
- I was rougher
picking up token suckers

19:39.379 --> 19:40.880
when I was back in uniform.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.349
I did not torture Marks.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.816
- It's a
"he-said, you-said."

19:43.850 --> 19:46.519
- I'm a credible guy.
- Let's hope so.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.987
- Just so I'm sure of this,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.290
it doesn't matter how illegal
the arrest was?

19:50.323 --> 19:53.293
- Go figure.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.761
Truth is, I had no idea either

19:54.794 --> 19:57.464
until I cracked
the books last night.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.932
- Next time,

19:59.966 --> 20:02.402
you'd better tell me before
you pull something like this.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.536
- I didn't know
it was legal.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.004
- Well, that's comforting.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.973
- Come on, Liv.
This is Byron Marks, okay?

20:07.006 --> 20:09.008
I could live with
a little mud on my face.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.577
- But I can't.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.945
While I'm sitting
in the big office,

20:12.979 --> 20:16.749
we do things the right way,
the legal way.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.752
- Like you didn't want Marks
as much as I did.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.626
[soft music]

20:26.659 --> 20:31.731
- We screwed up
the first time, didn't we?

20:31.764 --> 20:37.370
We waited too long
to arrest him.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.707
And now, I need to go home

20:40.740 --> 20:46.012
and teach my son
that lying is a bad thing.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.687
Okay.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.523
Sweetheart, does that--

20:56.556 --> 20:57.890
does that hurt you?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.058
- No.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.960
- No? Good.

21:00.993 --> 21:06.065
So, Noah,
I saw Ms. Smiley today.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.568
And she said that you told
the school nurse

21:08.601 --> 21:10.603
that I gave you that bruise.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.739
- She asked.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.007
- Noah, we talked about
telling the truth, remember?

21:15.041 --> 21:16.676
- I did tell the truth.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.511
- I gave you that?

21:18.545 --> 21:19.879
- Yeah.
- When?

21:19.912 --> 21:21.814
- When the taxi
almost hit me, remember?

21:26.986 --> 21:29.489
- Oh, my gosh.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.592
Honey, I forgot.
I forgot.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.895
Oh, sweet boy.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.797
I'm so sorry.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.801
Come on.
Let's get you to bed.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.836
Head up.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.038
Oh, there you go, sweet boy.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.642
*

21:49.676 --> 21:52.579
Listen, you did
the right thing, Noah.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.581
But if anybody asks you
about that bruise,

21:54.614 --> 21:56.082
you tell them what happened.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.051
But you gotta tell them
the whole story, okay?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.086
- Okay.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.390
- I love you.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.991
- I love you too.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.726
- Good night.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.096
Good night, sweet boy.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.569
- It was in the morning.
It was Tuesday.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.137
I didn't have to be at work
until 10:00.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.072
- And what kind of work
do you do, Mr. Marks?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.774
- I tutor English.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.976
- That's admirable.
- Objection.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.545
- I'll sustain it.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.680
- So, what did you
do before work?

22:27.714 --> 22:30.550
- I kissed my wife
and daughter good-bye.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.784
- Are they Americans too?

22:31.818 --> 22:33.152
- No, sir.
They're Cuban.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.587
- Then what did you do?

22:34.621 --> 22:36.956
- I went to a local café.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.826
When I left,
I was grabbed by two men.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.061
They pushed me into
the back of a van.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.698
Detective Tutuola
was waiting inside.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.066
He put cuffs on me.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.535
We drove someplace,

22:48.568 --> 22:50.437
and they left me in the back

22:50.470 --> 22:52.071
of the van for four hours.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.773
- And you're claiming
that's torture?

22:53.806 --> 22:57.944
- It was over 100 degrees
that day.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.079
I was dripping.
I couldn't breathe.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.681
I was nauseous.

23:01.714 --> 23:06.953
I think I passed out
several times.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.055
- When I interviewed
the defendant six years ago,

23:09.088 --> 23:11.057
I learned he was
a jazz fanatic.

23:11.090 --> 23:14.694
He was into a sax player
called Walter Smith.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.729
He said he was
the next Coltrane.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.898
Yeah, so I checked him out.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.601
I would go to Smith's website
every now and then

23:21.634 --> 23:23.135
to check the comments.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.104
- Hoping Mr. Marks
would write in?

23:25.137 --> 23:26.739
- Yeah, I took a shot.

23:26.773 --> 23:29.041
A couple weeks ago,
somebody wrote in saying

23:29.075 --> 23:32.579
that Smith improvised
as well as Coltrane.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.113
It was signed,
"B from Havana."

23:34.146 --> 23:35.582
- And you thought
it was Mr. Marks?

23:35.615 --> 23:36.916
- It was.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.551
So I went down there,
and I found him.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.119
And I put him in
the back of a van

23:40.152 --> 23:42.021
until I was able to convince
the local cops

23:42.054 --> 23:44.791
that I was who I was
and he was who he was.

23:44.824 --> 23:45.958
- So you didn't
torture him?

23:45.992 --> 23:47.159
- No.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.427
- All right.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.231
- If, in the course
of your job,

23:52.264 --> 23:55.768
you found a dog sitting in
a car on a 100 degree day,

23:55.802 --> 23:57.069
what would you do?

23:57.103 --> 23:59.238
- I'd break the glass
and let him out.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.540
- Would you arrest
the owner?

24:00.573 --> 24:01.841
- That's my job.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.176
- For animal cruelty?
- Yeah.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.880
- So we've decided as a society
that it would be cruel

24:07.914 --> 24:10.182
to keep a dog in a hot car.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.752
But you decided on your own
that it's okay to keep a man

24:12.785 --> 24:14.220
in one for four hours.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.988
- I checked on that van
every now and then.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.957
He never once
asked to get out.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.192
- Could be because
he was unconscious.

24:20.226 --> 24:25.665
*

24:25.698 --> 24:30.503
- Although I don't approve
of Detective Tutuola's tactics,

24:30.537 --> 24:32.539
I don't think they've reached
the level of torture

24:32.572 --> 24:35.274
as defined by the
Second Circuit in Toscanino.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.511
So therefore,
the trial of Mr. Marks

24:38.545 --> 24:40.880
will proceed forthwith

24:40.913 --> 24:42.815
unless anyone
has any more motions.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.184
- As a matter of fact,
Your Honor.

24:45.217 --> 24:48.655
Mr. Formosa is from
the Cuba Permanent Mission

24:48.688 --> 24:50.089
at the U.N.

24:50.122 --> 24:53.159
- Your Honor, on behalf
of the Cuban government,

24:53.192 --> 24:55.695
I object to agents
of your government

24:55.728 --> 24:58.097
violating our borders
and our laws.

24:58.130 --> 25:01.233
I demand that Mr. Marks be
turned over to my custody

25:01.267 --> 25:03.870
to be returned
to Cuba immediately.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.574
- Looks like we've got
a political question

25:07.607 --> 25:08.908
on our hands, Judge.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.242
Don't take this personally,

25:10.276 --> 25:11.711
but you're not competent
to hear it.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.112
No judge is.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.882
- Well, not before lunch,
I'm not.

25:15.915 --> 25:23.122
*

25:23.723 --> 25:25.558
- Barba told me
what's going on.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.596
You know what
Frankie said?

25:29.629 --> 25:30.930
He said,
"What did I expect?

25:30.963 --> 25:33.199
The cops don't care.
Why should I?"

25:33.232 --> 25:35.835
- Hold on, Karla.
You know that that's not true.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.705
- You told me closure's
a good thing.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.206
That it helps
the healing process.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.741
- It is.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.576
- Well, seeing Byron Marks
go to jail--

25:43.610 --> 25:45.144
what better closure is that?

25:45.177 --> 25:46.212
- Fine.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.681
Come on, why don't
we have a seat?

25:48.715 --> 25:50.917
Karla, you're not--
you're not the same person

25:50.950 --> 25:54.086
that you were the last time
I saw you.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.757
Last time, all you talked about
was running away.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.091
- Well, maybe I was
on to something.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.761
- Look, you didn't
let this stop you.

26:01.794 --> 26:02.962
You got married--

26:02.995 --> 26:04.997
- Yeah, chalk one
up for me.

26:06.933 --> 26:11.037
So whether or not Marks
even has a trial,

26:11.070 --> 26:12.872
it's up to
the politicians?

26:12.905 --> 26:15.808
- Unless your testimony
sways the judge.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.243
- I don't understand.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.245
Why in the world would Cuba
want Byron Marks back?

26:19.278 --> 26:21.981
- Because it enjoys
being a thorn in our side.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.383
Once politics intrudes
on the law,

26:24.416 --> 26:26.318
then nothing makes sense.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.121
For Cuba to have standing,
it must show harm

26:29.155 --> 26:31.824
to one of its citizens.

26:31.858 --> 26:35.361
Tomorrow, Byron's wife
is going to testify.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.332
We need you, Karla.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.070
- You know,

26:44.103 --> 26:46.205
Frankie may not be
a Rhode's Scholar,

26:46.238 --> 26:49.341
but sometimes
he's not that stupid.

26:49.375 --> 26:54.613
*

26:56.849 --> 26:59.118
- I met Byron five years ago.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.820
He came into my store.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.221
- What kind of store?

27:02.254 --> 27:04.423
- We sell
knitting materials.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.694
Mi tia owns it.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.862
We went to lunch.

27:09.896 --> 27:14.233
Byron was polite and kind.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.303
We went to lunch
every day for weeks.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.339
And we fell in love.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.009
Then we got married.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.944
It's wrong what
your policeman did.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.714
If you don't let
Byron return home,

27:27.747 --> 27:29.782
it will destroy Teresa.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.684
- Who is Teresa, Elana?

27:31.718 --> 27:35.054
- Our daughter.

27:35.087 --> 27:38.324
She's only four years old.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.126
I don't see why
you're doing this to us.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.995
- Thank you, Mrs. Marks.
We can finish tomorrow.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.463
- In light of the
present circumstances,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.432
I request that
the defendant be released

27:46.465 --> 27:48.167
on his own recognizance.
- That is ridiculous.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.002
The man has raped
three women.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.337
- Then why have you only
charged him with one count?

27:51.370 --> 27:52.739
Perhaps Karla Wyatt's
testimony doesn't pass

27:52.772 --> 27:54.140
the smell test, either.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.108
Perhaps you should
reconsider this whole thing.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.777
- The People request that Mr.
Marks be remanded to custody.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.746
- If this court isn't
competent to hear this case,

27:59.779 --> 28:02.048
it's certainly not competent
to incarcerate the defendant,

28:02.081 --> 28:03.783
even if it's just over night.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.052
- I'll release him into
your custody, Mr. Dworkin.

28:06.085 --> 28:10.957
But the two of you better
show up here in the morning.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.024
- That's... fine.

28:12.058 --> 28:16.963
*

28:16.996 --> 28:18.330
You did great.
You did great, honey.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.332
Great.
I love you.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.771
- I want him followed.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.906
- I'm on it.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.041
- You've done enough damage,
don't you think?

28:29.075 --> 28:31.243
Stick with Marks until
your partners can take over.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.779
I'm afraid His Honor
doesn't want to be the cause

28:32.812 --> 28:34.914
of an international incident.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.783
My guess,
this time tomorrow,

28:45.424 --> 28:45.792
.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.727
[indistinct chatter]

28:51.397 --> 28:54.466
[tense music]

28:54.500 --> 29:01.407
*

29:05.344 --> 29:06.312
- Lost eyes.

29:06.345 --> 29:11.483
*

29:11.517 --> 29:13.219
- I got him.

29:17.223 --> 29:20.492
It's, uh--
It's outrageous,

29:20.526 --> 29:22.962
allowing a governmental
kidnapping in another country.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.797
It violates every tenet
of international law

29:24.831 --> 29:26.298
protecting human rights.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.034
- You know, maybe if Fin
grabbed up a polar bear.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.369
But a guy like Byron Marks,

29:30.402 --> 29:33.072
you could drag him by
his hair over a street

29:33.105 --> 29:34.440
of rusty razor blades,
for all I care.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.242
As long as he
ends up in Sing Sing.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.346
Marks is on the move.
Alone.

29:40.379 --> 29:46.485
- He's had four cups of coffee.
I'd be moving too.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.087
[sighs]

29:48.120 --> 29:50.222
All right, what is to stop
Raúl Castro

29:50.256 --> 29:52.291
from sending a Federale here
to kidnap Fin?

29:52.324 --> 29:54.226
- You're driving me nuts
with this.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.462
Carisi, look, I know
you went to law school,

29:56.495 --> 29:57.930
but when you're with me,

29:57.964 --> 30:01.133
can you please
just be a cop, okay?

30:08.007 --> 30:09.375
- Either there's
a line at the urinal,

30:09.408 --> 30:10.376
or something's up.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.410
- Yeah.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.948
*

30:15.982 --> 30:17.616
- This is harassment!

30:17.649 --> 30:19.986
- Yeah, it's gonna be a lot
worse if he's not back there.

30:20.019 --> 30:27.226
*

30:29.996 --> 30:31.063
- [groans]

30:31.097 --> 30:36.435
*

30:36.468 --> 30:38.871
- We've got JFK
and LaGuardia covered.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.039
- Okay. Newark?

30:40.072 --> 30:41.107
- Done.
- Buses? Trains?

30:41.140 --> 30:42.408
- Done.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.010
He doesn't have
his passport, Liv,

30:44.043 --> 30:45.077
so he can't leave
the country.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.312
- So where the hell is he?

30:52.184 --> 30:56.222
[phone beeping]

30:56.255 --> 30:58.324
Come on, Karla.
Answer the phone.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.529
Answer the phone.

31:03.562 --> 31:10.602
*

31:12.438 --> 31:14.941
Karla?

31:14.974 --> 31:16.142
It's me, Olivia Benson.

31:16.175 --> 31:23.349
*

31:27.486 --> 31:28.520
Karla...

31:28.554 --> 31:30.056
- Go away, Olivia.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.357
- Karla, you know
I can't do that.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.360
So I need you to
give me that gun, okay?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.062
- Women.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.964
- You think this is funny?

31:37.997 --> 31:41.600
- Karla, now you know that this
is not gonna end well, okay?

31:41.633 --> 31:44.503
I don't want to see you spending
the rest of your life in prison.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.638
- What do you think I've been
living in the last six years?

31:46.672 --> 31:50.476
Every morning I brush my teeth,
I see this.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.478
Every time
I brush my hair--

31:52.511 --> 31:54.346
- Karla, let's think
this through; let's be smart.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.715
- I want him to feel
a little bit of what I felt.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.485
- I know, I know.
- I wasn't gonna hurt you.

31:59.518 --> 32:03.489
I just--I wanted to tell you
about my wife and my daughter.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.425
I just wanted to say how sorry
I was and ask you not

32:06.458 --> 32:08.394
to testify against me tomorrow.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.096
- And you think I should just
let you go back to Cuba

32:10.129 --> 32:11.263
like nothing happened?

32:11.297 --> 32:16.235
- Karla.
Karla, look at me.

32:16.268 --> 32:20.272
Come on.
Let's think this through, okay?

32:20.306 --> 32:24.643
I want you to point
the gun at me, Karla.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.312
Point the gun at me.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.713
- I don't want him
to go back to Cuba, Olivia.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.348
- I understand that,
but point it at me.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.749
- With his wife
and daughter.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.684
What do I get?

32:32.718 --> 32:35.654
*

32:35.687 --> 32:37.223
Stand up!

32:37.256 --> 32:39.158
- Okay.

32:39.191 --> 32:43.996
- Do you remember what you made
me do before you cut my face?

32:44.030 --> 32:45.397
Do you remember--

32:45.431 --> 32:47.033
- I don't remember.
I don't remember.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.100
- You made me beg.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.135
- Easy.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.469
- Get down on your knees.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.371
Now, or I'll kill you
where you stand.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.406
- No, Karla, you won't.
- I'm gonna do it, Olivia.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.175
So you should just
walk out the door.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.676
- You know that
I can't do that.

32:57.709 --> 33:01.713
- It'll just take two minutes.
Who's gonna know?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.249
- I will.

33:03.282 --> 33:10.456
*

33:17.496 --> 33:22.368
- Now, I want you to beg
for me to shoot you.

33:22.401 --> 33:29.108
*

33:29.141 --> 33:30.576
- Karla.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.179
You know that I will
arrest you if you do this.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.280
Do you understand that?

33:34.313 --> 33:35.581
*

33:35.614 --> 33:36.648
- Beg.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.819
- Please shoot me.
- You call that begging?

33:40.852 --> 33:43.222
*

33:43.255 --> 33:45.157
- Please shoot me.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.259
- Karla.
- He took my life.

33:47.293 --> 33:51.663
I bought three tangerines and
two apples and a watermelon,

33:51.697 --> 33:53.665
and he took my life.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.501
*

33:55.534 --> 33:58.437
- Karla, that's gonna feel
good for maybe a day.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.839
For maybe--maybe a week.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.109
But the difference is, Karla,
this time,

34:03.142 --> 34:04.710
the hurt's gonna come back.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.279
And you are gonna
be behind bars, okay?

34:07.313 --> 34:09.215
- [sobs] No.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.749
- I'm gonna take
this gun, honey.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.218
I'm gonna take
this gun from you.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.319
I'm gonna take the gun.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.154
I'm gonna take the gun.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.188
I'm gonna take the gun.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.756
[gunshot]

34:17.789 --> 34:19.625
Get on the floor!
Get on your stomach now!

34:19.658 --> 34:21.593
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Hands behind your back now!

34:26.232 --> 34:29.401
- [crying]

34:29.435 --> 34:31.137
- You're okay.

34:41.847 --> 34:42.214
.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.215
- Did she at least think
he was going to assault her?

34:44.316 --> 34:45.351
- No.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.754
- Did he break in?

34:48.787 --> 34:50.656
- He was already inside
by the time that I got there.

34:50.689 --> 34:54.326
So I'll take Karla's statement
first thing in the morning.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.429
We'll keep him overnight for
attempted witness tampering.

34:57.463 --> 35:00.632
At least that way we can be sure
that he'll be in court tomorrow.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.634
- If only to file false
imprisonment charges.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.470
- Yeah.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.871
- What the hell,

35:05.904 --> 35:10.509
maybe you should have
let her shoot him.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.244
That was a joke.

35:16.348 --> 35:19.485
- I told her to point
a loaded gun at me.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.692
I have a kid, Raphael.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.360
What was I thinking?

35:35.834 --> 35:37.869
- Anyway...

35:39.805 --> 35:43.942
- Is there any way to convince
a judge

35:43.975 --> 35:47.646
that this is not
a political question?

35:47.679 --> 35:51.450
- A young naive Cuban mommy
crying on the stand

35:51.483 --> 35:53.485
because the father of her
baby was taken away

35:53.519 --> 35:55.221
by the big bad
U.S. government?

35:55.254 --> 35:58.290
[soft music]

35:58.324 --> 36:05.464
*

36:05.997 --> 36:08.534
Where are you going?

36:08.567 --> 36:09.968
- To take
Karla's statement.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.704
*

36:12.738 --> 36:16.208
- He took me from behind.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.944
He bent me over the table.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.946
I saw the blood from my cheek

36:20.979 --> 36:25.651
just pooling on the placemat
under my head.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.287
I tried counting crumbs

36:28.320 --> 36:31.290
from the slice of toast
I had for breakfast.

36:31.323 --> 36:34.993
And I'd get to seven or eight.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.796
I would just lose count
and start over again.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.465
- This is completely
out of line.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.666
- And if you don't want
to hear it, Mr. Dworkin,

36:40.699 --> 36:42.801
you're welcome to leave.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.002
- That can't be Byron.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.405
- Oh, it was Byron.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.375
He wanted me to beg him
to do it harder,

36:49.408 --> 36:51.543
but I couldn't speak,
so he held the knife

36:51.577 --> 36:53.479
to my throat.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.949
All I could think of was that
my mom called that morning,

36:57.983 --> 36:59.718
and I didn't pick up the phone.

36:59.751 --> 37:03.589
And now I was gonna die.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.392
- Karla, if you can,

37:06.425 --> 37:09.361
tell her what he did
when he was done with you.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.933
- After it was over,

37:14.966 --> 37:20.372
he just let me
drop to the ground.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.908
And before he left,

37:22.941 --> 37:24.310
he...

37:26.745 --> 37:29.247
He just pissed on me.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.319
- Come on.
Elana, let's go.

37:33.352 --> 37:36.555
- We have his DNA.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.057
So he's done
the exact same thing

37:39.090 --> 37:41.760
to at least two other women.

37:41.793 --> 37:45.731
*

37:45.764 --> 37:47.299
So you have a young daughter.

37:47.333 --> 37:50.068
What's her name?
- Teresa.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.903
- That's a pretty name.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.005
- She's four.
She just started school.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.608
- Ah, my son just
started school as well.

37:56.642 --> 37:57.876
His name is Noah.

37:57.909 --> 38:01.380
He--he insisted on bringing

38:01.413 --> 38:03.081
his stuffed bear
with him to school

38:03.114 --> 38:06.952
because he didn't want Teddy
to be scared while he was away.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.921
- Teresa has a little doll.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.823
Maria.

38:11.857 --> 38:15.861
She used her allowance
to buy Maria a dress

38:15.894 --> 38:18.764
because Maria wants to be pretty
at Teresa's birthday party.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.466
*

38:20.499 --> 38:21.800
- Look, this is
all very interesting,

38:21.833 --> 38:23.502
but we have to be in court.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.872
- Elana, do you really want
somebody like Byron Marks

38:26.905 --> 38:29.975
raising your daughter, Teresa?

38:30.008 --> 38:33.579
He rapes women,
and then he urinates on them

38:33.612 --> 38:40.085
so they'll know how
disgusted they make him.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.520
- Let's go.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.522
- No!

38:43.555 --> 38:46.625
What if I don't want Byron
to come back home?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.394
What if I want to change
what I said in court?

38:48.427 --> 38:49.995
- That's okay. You can.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.998
All you have to do
is tell the truth.

38:53.031 --> 38:59.738
*

38:59.771 --> 39:03.108
- [speaking Spanish]

39:05.911 --> 39:09.147
- If Cuba loses standing
to assert its claim,

39:09.180 --> 39:11.717
our attorney will withdraw
its motion.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.921
- Is my husband
going in jail?

39:15.954 --> 39:17.756
- Your husband is gonna pay

39:17.789 --> 39:22.794
for what he did to Karla
and the other women.

39:22.828 --> 39:25.497
- I can go home now?

39:25.531 --> 39:27.799
- I'll get you on a plane.

39:32.504 --> 39:35.774
- I suppose you'd
be willing to talk?

39:35.807 --> 39:39.044
- As long as he
does double digits.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.513
And the first one is 2.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.882
- Yeah.
- Meet me in my office.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.954
- [groans]

39:48.987 --> 39:50.456
Thank you.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.123
- That was all you, Karla.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.559
You did that.

39:55.927 --> 40:00.031
- That closure you talk about,

40:00.065 --> 40:01.667
when does that start?

40:01.700 --> 40:02.901
- [laughs]

40:05.571 --> 40:07.105
You're gonna be good.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.942
That I can promise you.

40:10.976 --> 40:17.783
*

40:17.816 --> 40:19.117
Who wants ice cream?

40:19.150 --> 40:20.486
- I do!

40:20.519 --> 40:22.087
Can I have strawberry?

40:22.120 --> 40:25.056
- You finished all
the strawberry, remember?

40:25.090 --> 40:27.192
All we have is vanilla.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.694
- Is there syrup?

40:28.727 --> 40:31.963
- You finished all the syrup,
too, Noah.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.533
[knock on door]

40:34.566 --> 40:35.801
Did you invite
somebody over?

40:35.834 --> 40:37.002
- Nope.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.137
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.807
- Then who is it?

40:51.617 --> 40:52.751
Wow.

40:54.586 --> 40:55.821
Hello.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.623
- Hey, Liv.

40:57.656 --> 41:00.492
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah.

41:00.526 --> 41:01.727
I was in--I was in
the neighborhood.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.129
I figured you owe me
a cup of coffee.

41:04.162 --> 41:07.866
- Oh, I do, but unfortunately

41:07.899 --> 41:10.268
now is, uh,

41:10.301 --> 41:11.670
is not a great time.

41:11.703 --> 41:12.904
- Oh.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.606
- But how are you?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.174
I heard you moved
to Florida.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.743
- Yeah.
Can you believe that?

41:17.776 --> 41:19.611
- How's that early bird
special treating you?

41:19.645 --> 41:21.613
- Oh, that's funny.
That's good stuff, Liv.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.682
I don't know, you know,
truth be told,

41:23.715 --> 41:26.685
after hitting a dozen balls
into the lake on the 16th

41:26.718 --> 41:29.888
in Forest Park,
I realized that, um,

41:29.921 --> 41:32.524
retirement was not my thing.

41:32.558 --> 41:34.626
You know?
- I get it.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.595
- Yeah, I knew you would.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.997
The DA's office, they were
looking for an investigator.

41:39.030 --> 41:42.233
So, uh--
ta-dah.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.135
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.173
On the job six weeks, and I
caught a child abuse case.

41:48.206 --> 41:51.276
- Oh.
- And, uh,

41:51.309 --> 41:54.045
SVU had to
recuse themselves.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.581
- That's odd.

41:55.614 --> 42:00.118
- Yeah, actually, uh,
not really, Liv.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.087
We're investigating you.

42:02.120 --> 42:09.527
