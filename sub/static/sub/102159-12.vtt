38:27.957 --> 38:30.786
remembered what I was
fighting for.

38:31.657 --> 38:34.268
I had a little bit of help.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.537
It's okay.
It's okay.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.626
He's on our side.

38:46.411 --> 38:47.673
- Lois.

38:48.761 --> 38:52.330
- John, you've actually
met our kids before.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.332
- Ah, yeah, I remember.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.551
Nice to do this
under better circumstances.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.379
- Thank you.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.643
And I never said sorry
about hitting you with a truck.

39:01.687 --> 39:04.211
-
- No hard feelings.

39:05.473 --> 39:07.170
The good news,
Morgan Edge is in

39:07.214 --> 39:09.129
a state-of-the-art
military prison.

39:09.172 --> 39:11.349
He's never gonna hurt
anyone again.

39:11.392 --> 39:12.654
- Do you wanna stay for dinner?

39:12.698 --> 39:14.482
I order a mean takeout.

39:16.136 --> 39:17.877
I gotta wrap things up
with your dad.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.489
Besides, family time is sacred,

39:21.533 --> 39:23.970
and you guys
are definitely due.

39:36.635 --> 39:37.679
- Bring it in.
Come on.

39:37.723 --> 39:40.378
Bring it in.
-

39:46.601 --> 39:49.648
- Hey, everyone,
look who's here.

39:49.691 --> 39:52.433
- Oh, my sweet girl.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.043
I missed you so much.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.958
You smell what Daddy's got
cooking up over here?

39:56.002 --> 39:58.613
- Are those dinosaur pancakes?
- Mm-hmm.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.833
- For dinner?
- Yeah, why not?

40:00.876 --> 40:03.531
All right, I got two
Sophie-saurus Rexes

40:03.575 --> 40:05.054
coming right up.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.230
- Sophie.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.536
- Sarah!

40:08.580 --> 40:09.885
-
Hi!

40:09.929 --> 40:11.365
Oh!

40:11.409 --> 40:13.976
- Did you miss me?
- I missed you so much.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.414
- Anything happen
when I was gone?

40:17.110 --> 40:20.243
- No, things are kinda boring
when you're not around, so...

40:22.376 --> 40:25.901
- All right,
a little appetizer for you.

40:26.772 --> 40:29.122
- You know we're gonna be okay,
right?

40:32.734 --> 40:34.606
- Yeah, I'm gonna
make sure of it.

40:37.347 --> 40:40.307
- So Leslie Larr
is still in the wind?

40:40.350 --> 40:41.656
- At this point,

40:41.700 --> 40:42.962
she doesn't really
have a next move.

40:43.005 --> 40:45.399
- Finding her
is our number one priority.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.574
Good news is,

40:46.618 --> 40:49.664
between you
and Mr. John Henry Irons,

40:49.708 --> 40:51.361
smart money says
she'll be in custody

40:51.405 --> 40:52.537
by the end of the week.

40:52.580 --> 40:56.497
And then DOD packs up,

40:56.541 --> 40:57.803
heads home.

40:57.846 --> 40:59.892
Maybe this town
can breathe again.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.635
Not to mention this family.

41:04.723 --> 41:08.161
For what it's worth,
Lois, about yesterday...

41:08.204 --> 41:09.684
- I know, Dad.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.860
You were just doing your job.

41:13.601 --> 41:17.083
- What I wanted to say is,

41:17.126 --> 41:19.085
I'm proud of you.

41:19.128 --> 41:21.740
When the chips were down,
you still had faith,

41:21.783 --> 41:24.307
and that's what made
the difference.

41:26.353 --> 41:28.137
I'm very glad you're better,
Clark.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.750
I won't doubt you again.

41:47.592 --> 41:52.335
<i>- Complete what you were
sent here for.</i>

42:19.058 --> 42:21.930
- Greg, move your head.
