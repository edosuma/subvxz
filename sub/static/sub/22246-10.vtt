[door unlocks]

00:30.864 --> 00:31.906
[door slams]

00:49.632 --> 00:52.302
[theme music playing]

02:31.776 --> 02:32.986
[door slams]

02:37.031 --> 02:38.116
Got another one.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.995
"Wish you were here."

02:45.748 --> 02:48.251
"Dear Holden, it's been some time
since we've seen each other,

02:48.334 --> 02:52.505
and while the memory of your voice
has faded, what we discussed has not.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.257
I've had more insights into my behavior,

02:54.382 --> 02:57.260
which I'd like to share with you
at your earliest convenience.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.220
Warmest regards, Ed Kemper."

02:59.304 --> 03:00.638
Ed Kemper writes you?

03:00.763 --> 03:02.599
[Tench]
If OPR decides to pay a site visit...

03:02.682 --> 03:05.393
-[Holden] Fuck 'em.
-[phone rings]

03:06.895 --> 03:09.480
-Bill Tench.
-Bill, Detective Chambers.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.859
-Hey, Gordon, how's it going down there?
-You're not gonna be happy.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.736
Okay.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.988
I had Devier come in,
suggested a polygraph.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.532
I wanted to see his reaction,
and he agreed to it.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.409
-You polygraphed him?
-That's right.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.660
And he passed.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.412
-Inconclusive.
-[Tench] Shit.

03:24.537 --> 03:25.997
We don't get that result too often.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.291
Because it only occurs
six percent of the time.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.835
It usually has to do
with how the questions are worded.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.962
-Lab found Lisa's blood on the rock.
-Inconclusive.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.048
Devier, he'd cleaned the car.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.425
-[Tench] And so, no physical evidence.
-That's right.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.010
Think that's bad, the inconclusive?

03:39.093 --> 03:42.597
Definitely won't put him away with it.
Worst case scenario, he's exonerated.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.224
-Can you hold a moment?
-Sure.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.101
-You get that?
-They've got nothing on him?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.978
He was happy to take the polygraph.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.064
[Holden] Now he'll be cockier than ever.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.108
-See if he'll talk to us.
-[Tench] There's no way.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.026
Ask him.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.904
How convinced are we that he's guilty?
What percentage convinced?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.405
-Hundred percent.
-I'm about 70.

03:59.489 --> 04:03.076
It is no accident that this tree trimmer
was accused of rape in another county.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.327
He'd have to be Mirandized.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.080
It's a death penalty state.
There's nothing in it for him.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.500
He is a narcissist.
Might just do it to prove that he can.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.338
Have Chambers extend an invitation.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.135
-Hey, Gordon?
-Yeah.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.762
Here's an idea.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.016
Can you bring in Devier later?

04:27.475 --> 04:28.810
Sure. Tonight?

04:28.893 --> 04:31.688
6:00, 7:00 p.m.
Casual, a little evening chat.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.481
Assure him he's not under arrest,
but it's important,

04:33.564 --> 04:35.149
the FBI wants to talk to him.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.568
We're doing this after-hours
to be more casual?

04:37.652 --> 04:40.321
Make it seem that way.
He'll be tired, he'll let down his guard.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.574
Then he'll realize we're working overtime.
We mean business.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.870
Once he gets to the station,
let him wait before we talk to him.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.789
-[Chambers] Okay.
-At least an hour.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.499
[Chambers] That's supposed to...

04:51.582 --> 04:53.668
You ever wait for test results
in a doctor's office?

04:53.751 --> 04:56.087
We need to create in him
a visceral memory.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.673
We need to elicit
a physiological response.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.925
-We need a shoe.
-A shoe?

05:01.009 --> 05:01.843
Ah.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.636
Something we used
to crack another sociopath.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.888
We need to find the equivalent for Devier.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.023
-Show me everything you got on Devier.
-Brass.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.777
-This is it?
-[Brassel] That's it.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.864
Okay, I need a lot more.
Several of these folders, make them thick.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.533
Go to the copier.
Use blank pages if you need to.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.535
I want it to look
like Manhattan Yellow Pages.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.705
-Evidence room?
-[Chambers] This way.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.337
What have we here?

05:43.426 --> 05:47.138
This is great. This is perfect.
Where's her baton? Her twirling baton?

05:49.223 --> 05:51.434
-She didn't have that on her.
-Okay.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.022
Take all of this to the interview room.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.440
Yes, sir.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.151
You have anything
from where the body was found?

06:00.234 --> 06:02.236
Just on that shelf, the one below.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.828
Well, all right.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.334
-Is there a five and dime around here?
-Right off the square.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.462
Get a baton, fine if it's cheap.
Remove the price tag.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.005
-Drag it around in the dirt.
-Okay.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.550
I don't want him to see evidence.
I want him to see a sweet little girl.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.593
Hurry.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.016
Listen, when we get Devier in here,

06:32.100 --> 06:35.144
I'm gonna ask him questions
that may make you uncomfortable.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.273
Acing the polygraph just lowered
his blood pressure, so sit tight, okay?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.109
Sure.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.822
All this an FBI thing?

06:46.864 --> 06:49.826
It's, uh... his thing.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.622
[man over radio]
We have Devier coming across the street.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.593
[officer] Devier.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.430
Come right through here.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.313
[indistinct radio chatter]

07:25.278 --> 07:27.655
So I'm going to have you
wait down the hall here.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.158
Wait while the agents come in.
Bring back smokes or anything?

07:30.241 --> 07:32.118
-[Devier] Yeah, that'd be great.
-All right.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.996
[Devier] Don't know how much more
information I can provide,

07:35.079 --> 07:36.873
but I'll help any way I can.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.875
They just want to talk to you.
Through here.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.379
[Tench sighs]

07:45.631 --> 07:46.799
[door opens]

07:53.181 --> 07:54.390
[Holden] He's in there.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.060
Gene, hello.
I'm Special Agent Holden Ford.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.687
-Hi.
-Special Agent Bill Tench.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.106
-Hey.
-Detective Chambers, you guys have met.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.317
Thanks for doing this.
You've been Mirandized, right?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.152
-Again.
-[Holden] Great.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.154
We're gonna do this
as quickly as possible.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.823
I'm sure you've got
better things to do tonight.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.536
[Devier] Army life wasn't for me.
I'll admit that.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.998
Too regimented. Couldn't stand them
barking orders at me all the time.

08:19.081 --> 08:22.251
-[Holden exhales]
-I like things more laid back, you know.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.254
Working outdoors, the fresh air.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.965
John, my boss,
he was great about hiring me,

08:28.090 --> 08:29.509
even with the discharge.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.679
It seemed like a perfect fit.
Out in the weather, working with my hands.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.181
Military's not for everyone.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.433
You can't know that before you go in.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.559
You went voluntarily?

08:38.643 --> 08:41.354
'Nam was pretty much over,
figured it'd be low-key.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.189
Looks like you've married
and divorced twice.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.733
What can I say?
I'm popular with the ladies.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.110
-Or unpopular.
-Depending on how you look at it.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.612
[Devier] I made mistakes.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.614
Married my first girl when we were 16.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.407
Just after you dropped out of high school?

08:53.491 --> 08:55.284
-[Devier] Yeah.
-Why'd you drop out?

08:55.743 --> 08:56.869
Trouble sitting still.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.871
School made me a little nuts, too.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.873
Wow, so you married your first girl.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.043
-Why'd you split up?
-We were fighting all the time.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.170
-What about your second wife?
-[chuckles] Same story.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.422
But you're living again
with your first ex-wife?

09:08.506 --> 09:11.884
Yeah. I know. I know. It's kind of--

09:11.968 --> 09:13.594
[Holden] Same story? Still fighting?

09:13.678 --> 09:16.138
-[Devier] Sometimes.
-But she's not 16 anymore.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.058
[Devier laughs] Nope. Oh, no.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.977
The bloom of youth has faded.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.356
You all got a lot of information on me.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.316
The FBI is thorough.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.570
Yeah, well, what am I,
some kind of gangster?

09:31.153 --> 09:32.238
Bureaucracy.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.031
[sighs]

09:34.865 --> 09:37.910
Well, listen, I got to mosey
out of here soon, so if we could...

09:37.994 --> 09:39.412
Of course. Of course.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.455
Let's get down to business.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.416
You're really important to us, Gene.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.751
You were on Lisa's street
the week before she disappeared.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.254
You had a bird's-eye view
of the entire place.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.631
Yeah, but I mean, I didn't see nothing.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.342
You know, I was focused on them trees.
You got to be.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.637
-Especially when you're working the saw.
-Understood, but...

09:57.471 --> 09:59.640
we're kind of grasping at straws here.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.310
You're the closest thing we have
to an eyewitness.

10:03.811 --> 10:07.481
Well, I took your polygraph.
I'm an open book.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.524
[Holden] Thank you.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.402
So...

10:12.486 --> 10:14.822
you must have seen Lisa
coming and going that week.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.823
Not really.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.284
-Maybe once or twice.
-Well...

10:19.160 --> 10:22.288
If she wore that outfit,
couldn't have missed her.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.710
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I guess I saw her
in that a couple of times.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.670
Feathered hat, silver baton?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.005
Uh... yeah.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.215
What time she catch the school bus
in the morning?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.843
Well, let's see, I'd get there about 7:00,

10:35.926 --> 10:38.721
she'd come out maybe half hour later.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.974
And what time did the bus
drop her back off?

10:42.433 --> 10:43.351
Oh, I can't say.

10:43.434 --> 10:47.063
Um, I mean, maybe 3:30, 4:00.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.398
Ever see her talk to anyone
when she got off the bus?

10:49.482 --> 10:50.691
No, sir.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.402
Anyone on her street who looked like
he didn't belong there?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.405
Not that I can recall, but, I mean...

10:56.864 --> 10:59.450
I wasn't even working
the week that she disappeared.

10:59.533 --> 11:00.493
Right.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.954
Oh, hold on, it almost ended.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.878
That's what she had on her that day.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.009
Heartbreaking.

11:19.053 --> 11:23.224
-By all accounts, she was a sweet kid.
-Yeah, she seemed real friendly.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.101
You noticed that?

11:25.559 --> 11:28.896
You know, just saw her playing in the yard
with her dog, you know.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.856
I mean, I guess you could say she was--

11:30.940 --> 11:32.900
-Precocious?
-[Devier] Right.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.068
Did you ever talk to her?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.737
-No.
-She ever talk to you?

11:37.696 --> 11:39.824
-Waved a time or two.
-[Holden] Hmm.

11:42.910 --> 11:46.664
-[exhales] Was she a cheerleader?
-Majorette.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.584
Those girls on the dance team
are something else.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.587
I always had the hots for them.

11:54.922 --> 11:55.798
I mean...

11:58.634 --> 12:01.637
she looks pretty tasty in that outfit,
doesn't she?

12:04.473 --> 12:06.725
-Sure.
-It's very revealing.

12:07.726 --> 12:08.936
Yeah, I guess.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.564
Come on.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.607
You guys don't think so?

12:15.651 --> 12:17.361
[laughs] I mean...

12:17.445 --> 12:20.489
-[Holden] Definitely looks older than 12.
-See, that's what I thought.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.409
Okay. Thank you. So it's not just me?

12:23.492 --> 12:26.162
Well, these girls these days,
they're developing so early.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.079
[Holden] Sure are.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.708
Of course, Lisa was in junior high.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.210
Whoever picked her up
might not have known that.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.174
I mean, I'm sitting here
wracking my brain,

12:38.257 --> 12:40.301
trying to remember if I saw someone, but--

12:40.384 --> 12:42.136
[Holden] We believe he thought
she was older.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.721
She was friendly, probably came up to him.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.348
He thought if they got together,
it'd be consensual.

12:46.557 --> 12:50.186
Well, 14 is the age of consent.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.729
[Holden] Is that right?

12:52.646 --> 12:53.522
Yeah.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.191
Wow.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.905
I guess Georgia's kind of forward-thinking
in that respect.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.116
I mean, by the time
a woman has hair on her pussy,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.744
you'd think she'd be able to decide
who gets a piece of it.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.787
[Devier laughs]

13:08.871 --> 13:12.082
I mean, yeah, man.
I never thought about it like that before,

13:12.166 --> 13:13.626
-but, yeah.
-[Holden] But it's true.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.961
-Could make a case.
-[Holden] Some women shave down there.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.421
-You ever see that?
-No.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.965
[exhales] They look so young.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.761
-Have you seen it?
-[Holden] No, but heard tell.

13:23.844 --> 13:26.597
-I tried to get my girlfriend to do it.
-You think she would?

13:26.680 --> 13:30.434
-She's considering.
-[Devier] What did you even say to her?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.269
I told her, "Honey, this turns me on."

13:32.353 --> 13:35.648
-Just direct like that?
-Yeah, I don't know if she's gonna do it.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.693
Women have their own minds these days,
but it sure would be hot,

13:40.611 --> 13:41.612
don't you think?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.031
Sure.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.784
You got to make it with that young pussy
before it turns into Mom.

13:46.867 --> 13:47.785
[laughing]

13:51.914 --> 13:53.290
She's chatting him up,

13:53.415 --> 13:55.793
maybe he's thinking
she looks old enough to wear this outfit,

13:55.876 --> 13:59.046
twirl a baton, march in the band, probably
got some hair on her, but not too much.

13:59.838 --> 14:00.839
Let's take a break.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.217
-You need a break, Gene?
-[Devier] Um...

14:04.635 --> 14:07.304
-No, I'm okay.
-Well, I need a break.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.350
I am gravely concerned
with this line of questioning.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.060
I told you, you need to relax.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.896
If it came out in court we suggested
the girl flirted with him--

14:15.980 --> 14:17.940
-How would it come out?
-He turned off the tape.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.066
Yeah, I saw that.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.235
I don't know about that, either.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.320
You agree with this?

14:23.445 --> 14:25.447
In theory. Not so much in practice.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.368
I will take full responsibility
for what happens in there.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.962
[Devier] Most people
would call it a cherry picker,

14:40.087 --> 14:43.299
but the industry term would be
a boom lift or a boom truck.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.844
-[Holden] What's the highest you've been?
-About 50 feet.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.679
-In a tree?
-That's right.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.849
-But you're in a harness, right?
-Well, of course, at that height.

14:51.932 --> 14:56.061
But sometimes you got to get out
to get them faraway limbs.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.856
-Don't look down, huh?
-No, that don't bother me no more.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.066
You saw Lisa waving to you
a couple of times.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.068
Must not have been too far up to see that.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.528
No, I'm not too sure.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.572
-She ever talk to you?
-No.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.866
But I already told you that.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.493
Hmm. Okay.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.329
-Why?
-[Holden sighs]

15:13.871 --> 15:16.206
We have one person,
said she saw the two of you talking.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.961
-Well, I thought I was your star witness.
-[Holden] Only one watching the street.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.922
Listen, you're a good-looking guy.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.466
Did she just come up to you,
being friendly?

15:25.549 --> 15:28.677
She sees you up there every day,
sweating away in the hot sun.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.763
Could she have maybe offered you a soda?

15:33.974 --> 15:36.352
She could've come up and talked to me.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.020
Can you remember?

15:39.688 --> 15:41.815
-I guess.
-It's coming back to you.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.568
Just that... she could've talked to me.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.653
What did she say?

15:46.403 --> 15:47.905
-I don't know.
-[Holden] You don't?

15:48.906 --> 15:50.908
-[Devier] No.
-No idea at all?

15:50.991 --> 15:52.117
You weren't listening?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.621
I can't recall.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.957
She ask you about your work,
your day, where you live?

15:59.166 --> 16:00.501
Something like that.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.669
[Holden] Small talk.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.253
Sure.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.965
I bet she thought
you were a handsome cuss.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.300
I don't know.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.760
You think she was pretty?

16:12.846 --> 16:15.265
We've already established
she looked at least 14.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.064
-I guess I thought so.
-[Holden] You thought what?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.400
-That she was cute.
-She was precocious, too.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.902
Didn't mind that you were older.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.196
She probably kind of liked it.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.783
Yeah. I kind of thought she was into me.

16:32.866 --> 16:36.286
When your job ended and you weren't
on that street, you still think about her?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.580
-No.
-[Holden] You ever go back by the house,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.457
see if she wanted to talk some more?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.960
I mean, she started things, right?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.044
Kind of.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.341
[Holden] What about this jacket?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.346
You ever see her wear this?

16:57.224 --> 16:58.600
Here, take a closer look.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.488
When you picked her up from the bus,
was she wearing this jacket?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.243
There was a lot of blood
at the crime scene.

17:16.326 --> 17:19.496
We haven't revealed too many details,
but Lisa's skull was crushed.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.248
That blood goes everywhere.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.919
In crimes involving blunt force trauma,
it's almost impossible for the attacker

17:26.045 --> 17:28.422
to avoid getting his victim's blood
on him.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.716
The scalp has thousands of capillaries.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.135
Blood sprays everywhere, like a fine mist.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.387
It gets in your hair, up your nose.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.931
I'd be amazed
if you didn't get any on you.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.100
-He's washed.
-[Tench] What's under your fingernails?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.603
-[Holden] It's just dirt, Bill.
-We should take a sample.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.855
-He scrubbed his nails by now.
-Is it in your ears?

17:44.938 --> 17:47.357
I bet. When was the last time
you cleaned your ears?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.860
-[Holden] You want to take a sample?
-[Tench] Can we do that?

17:49.943 --> 17:51.528
Yeah. I can arrange that.

17:57.701 --> 17:58.952
You've gone quiet.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.246
[Tench] When we accuse somebody of murder,

18:01.330 --> 18:03.082
if they haven't done it,
they won't shut up.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.166
They protest their innocence.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.960
[Holden] Oh, God, yeah. "How dare you?
Fuck you. I know my rights."

18:07.044 --> 18:09.963
A guilty guy will clam up,
start listening intently,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.131
which is what you're doing.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.759
[Holden] If a guilty guy yells
to make you think he's innocent,

18:13.842 --> 18:16.553
-you can always tell the difference.
-Sure can.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.515
Why do you keep looking at that rock?

18:19.598 --> 18:22.017
An innocent man would have
to guess its significance.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.229
It's what was used to kill Lisa,
wasn't it?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.772
When things got out of hand.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.691
You didn't mean to, right?

18:29.775 --> 18:33.028
She came up to you, she seemed friendly,
and then everything went sideways.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.282
The question for us isn't "Did you do it?"
We know that you did it.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.867
The question for us is...

18:39.535 --> 18:40.494
"Why?"

18:41.537 --> 18:44.790
We think we know why, and we understand.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.002
All you have to do is tell us
if we're right.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.392
[sighs]

19:03.475 --> 19:05.519
-[Brassel] Can you teach this stuff?
-We should.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.772
Bill, why are not we teaching profiling
at the Academy?

19:08.856 --> 19:11.775
-Because we're still figuring it out.
-[scoffs]

19:11.859 --> 19:13.861
-[Brassel] You like this bourbon?
-Yeah.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.028
[Brassel] Two more.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.823
Now, what I can't get over is the rock.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.576
He could not control his reaction.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
-Everybody has a rock.
-[Brassel] What?

19:22.703 --> 19:24.496
Something that makes them sweat.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.499
Like, for example,
my senior year of college.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.502
I came home for Christmas, I'm sitting
at the kitchen table with my dad,

19:30.586 --> 19:33.005
and my mom brings over some eggnog.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.592
And she hands me a glass and she says,

19:36.717 --> 19:40.387
"Holden, have you had sexual relations
with a woman?"

19:40.470 --> 19:41.388
-Jesus, no.
-Yeah.

19:41.471 --> 19:45.058
And I say, "Uh, yeah, Mom, I have."

19:45.142 --> 19:46.852
And she says, "What's her name?"

19:46.935 --> 19:50.272
And I say, "Well, actually, Mom,
there's been a few."

19:50.772 --> 19:52.524
-Bottoms up.
-[laughs]

19:52.608 --> 19:53.609
[Holden] And then...

19:55.527 --> 19:58.405
Oh! And then she says, "Holden...

20:00.032 --> 20:01.950
who's going to have you
as a husband now?"

20:02.034 --> 20:03.410
-[laughs]
-I'm telling you,

20:03.493 --> 20:05.078
if she asked me that again today,

20:05.162 --> 20:07.748
the exact same thing would happen.
I would completely fall apart.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.208
She's your rock.

20:09.875 --> 20:10.959
Let's be clear.

20:11.418 --> 20:14.046
All he did was put the killer's
murder weapon in front of him.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.088
Bill, come on.

20:15.214 --> 20:19.051
We posited
that the killer might feel guilty.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.552
And then, I just...

20:21.678 --> 20:25.098
created a situation where the guilt
completely overwhelmed him.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.391
[Tench] It wasn't guilt.

20:26.475 --> 20:30.103
It was the pucker of "Oh, shit,
I'm going to the electric chair."

20:30.187 --> 20:32.773
-[Brassel laughs]
-How'd you come up with this stuff?

20:33.899 --> 20:37.694
By interviewing Richard Speck,
and Jerry Brudos, and Ed Kemper.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.240
-You talked to them firsthand?
-Uh-huh.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.450
And we've got Manson and Berkowitz
on the wish list.

20:43.533 --> 20:44.409
No shit.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.453
-Unbelievable.
-[Brassel] What are they like?

20:46.578 --> 20:50.457
Well, I don't think I'm speaking
out of turn here when I say...

20:50.582 --> 20:54.086
they are fucked up.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.213
-[laughing]
-Amen.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.592
So what did you say to him?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.886
I got him talking about
how hot young girls are,

21:02.970 --> 21:04.471
how they look older than their age.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.348
-Ugh.
-But it was the net effect.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.642
I laid out everything she had on her,

21:08.725 --> 21:12.145
a portrait of the last day
in the life of a 12-year-old girl.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.564
So you staged it. Like a director.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.149
I guess.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.610
Only he didn't know
he was playing a role in your drama.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.696
That is what made it a nail-biter.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.198
No one could have scripted
the reveal of the rock.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.617
He completely freaked.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.453
You could suddenly smell BO in the room.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.289
-Pavlovian.
-Guilt.

21:31.164 --> 21:34.167
But you were convinced he was guilty
before you went in.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.378
Well, it was pretty obvious.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.964
Yes, but presupposed.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.925
Correctly presupposed.

21:42.009 --> 21:45.637
Is it a fair experiment if you're working
backward from a conclusion?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.306
If your theory is proven right.

21:47.639 --> 21:51.184
Holden, you drove him
to an emotional response.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.729
I helped put a child murderer behind bars.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.063
Like Perry Mason?

21:55.856 --> 21:58.984
-That's right.
-Only Perry Mason never got off on it.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.362
-Please stop analyzing me.
-I'm not analyzing you.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.281
You run this commentary
on everything I do.

22:04.364 --> 22:07.075
I was talking about your work.
That's how we communicate, right?

22:07.159 --> 22:09.494
You talk about your job,
I give my opinion.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.371
Maybe I don't always want your opinion.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.624
-When I'm not in agreement with you.
-Could you just be my girlfriend?

22:14.708 --> 22:15.876
Could you just listen?

22:17.544 --> 22:19.504
You mean shut up and adore you?

22:19.588 --> 22:22.174
Well, you could try it. Once.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.285
[engine turns over]

22:51.787 --> 22:53.997
[Holden] Making furniture
from human remains

22:54.081 --> 22:55.707
qualifies as organized.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.459
We're famous.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.504
This is apparently the talk
of the Atlanta office.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.925
"Darrell Gene Devier
cracks under the questioning

23:05.008 --> 23:06.468
of a new type of FBI agent."

23:06.551 --> 23:09.179
-[Holden] Is that supposed to be us?
-Who the fuck do you think?

23:10.013 --> 23:11.056
Who's named?

23:11.515 --> 23:13.100
Read the part about, uh...

23:13.934 --> 23:17.896
"Behavioral Science's bright-eyed boy
who's friends with Ed Kemper."

23:17.979 --> 23:19.189
Who talked to a reporter?

23:19.272 --> 23:21.483
[Tench] Probably
your baby-faced drinking buddy.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.486
That was in confidence
to a member of law enforcement.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.571
-While you were drunk.
-Celebrating.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.074
"Using evidence from the crime scene,

23:29.157 --> 23:32.035
he managed to break through
Devier's psychological barriers"?

23:32.119 --> 23:33.578
This reads a lot like coercion.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.580
Worse, it sounds like horseshit.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.749
Devier was in that interrogation room

23:37.833 --> 23:40.418
because trees were trimmed
on the victim's street.

23:41.044 --> 23:43.797
-Good old-fashioned detective work.
-[Holden] That got him in the room.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.465
We got him to confess.

23:45.549 --> 23:49.177
-You cannot be proud of this.
-There's nothing egregious here.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.471
-Exposure could be good.
-[Carr] No.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.391
Can we all agree we are not ready
for Good Morning America?

23:54.474 --> 23:55.851
I did not give an interview.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.853
[Tench] Even if we were
accurately represented,

23:57.936 --> 24:00.772
people should not be reading about us
over breakfast.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.023
[Holden] Why not?

24:02.107 --> 24:03.525
Just because.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.068
Bill...

24:08.405 --> 24:12.617
is it possible that you're upset
because the article doesn't mention you?

24:22.669 --> 24:27.007
Hi, Susan. It's Dr. Wendy Carr.
I need to book a flight tomorrow.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.634
I don't know what to do
short of putting a muzzle on him.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.136
Please don't go back to Boston.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.096
Atlanta. Out of Dulles.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.474
-The same day if possible.
-Why are you going to Atlanta?

24:36.558 --> 24:38.560
-I'm gonna talk to the Floyd County DA.
-About what?

24:38.685 --> 24:41.354
It's in the article,
they're prosecuting a capital case.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.524
-So?
-So we can't be seen to be party to that.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.235
I'm sorry. Yes, I am.
Can you give me that number again?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.362
What? That's none of our concern.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.655
It's mine.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.241
-He slaughtered a 12-year-old girl.
-I know what he did.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.827
Oh, uh, window or aisle, both are fine.

24:55.911 --> 24:59.039
-Georgia's a death penalty state.
-I think I might need a car, too.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.749
What are you going to say to them?

25:01.249 --> 25:04.211
We're four interviews in.
No one is gonna talk to us

25:04.294 --> 25:06.546
if they think we're sending people
to the electric chair.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.299
No one in law enforcement will talk to us
if they think we're squeamish

25:09.382 --> 25:11.218
about executing rapists and murderers.

25:11.301 --> 25:14.179
Oh, that sounds lovely.
A convertible or a T-top.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.972
You cannot go representing the FBI.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.599
I don't intend to.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.559
They won't understand
how you're connected to this case.

25:19.643 --> 25:23.813
If you don't see how this situation
compromises us, I don't know what to say.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.733
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm so distracted.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.069
Can you give me that number
one more time?

25:29.152 --> 25:30.070
Go with her.

25:30.695 --> 25:31.947
You got us into this.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.408
[whispers] Shut the door.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.745
I got it this time. Thank you.

25:53.426 --> 25:56.554
Follow my lead.
I'm used to talking to law enforcement.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.311
District Attorney Mayweather, thank you
for meeting with us on such short notice.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.774
Oh, Esther, please. I am delighted to meet
the man who delivered me Gene Devier.

26:08.900 --> 26:09.943
My pleasure.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.445
Professor Carr's a consultant at the FBI

26:12.529 --> 26:14.739
and she has been instrumental
in developing a program--

26:14.823 --> 26:17.659
I'm sorry. I have as long as it takes
to finish this sandwich.

26:17.742 --> 26:22.163
We have been interviewing extremely
violent offenders. The worst of the worst.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.666
This involves establishing
an element of trust

26:24.749 --> 26:26.960
so that they offer information
to us voluntarily.

26:27.460 --> 26:31.006
We try to be objective
because what they have to say is valuable.

26:31.464 --> 26:34.467
But if they see that our techniques
are being used to eradicate them, then--

26:34.592 --> 26:37.345
Now how would your techniques
be used for that?

26:37.887 --> 26:42.142
Agent Ford assembled a psychological
sketch of Mr. Devier, based on research,

26:42.225 --> 26:44.477
which was used to secure a confession.

26:44.602 --> 26:47.272
So if he's convicted and executed, then--

26:47.355 --> 26:50.066
Honey, we don't kill criminals.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.444
They kill themselves.

26:52.819 --> 26:53.695
What does that mean?

26:53.778 --> 26:56.656
It's their behavior
that puts them in that chair.

26:56.740 --> 26:57.699
Actually, I think it's--

26:57.782 --> 27:01.119
When I talk to a jury,
I always ask, "Do you watch TV?"

27:01.202 --> 27:02.370
Most of them do.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.622
I say, "Who watches the cop shows?"

27:05.457 --> 27:08.418
Right there you know whether
you've got a smart jury or a stupid one.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.295
So I say, "Forget TV,

27:10.378 --> 27:13.089
'cause it'll never show you
the experience of the victim."

27:13.173 --> 27:14.716
-No.
-"You will never hear the cries

27:14.799 --> 27:17.927
of a woman being raped
on The Rockford Files.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.974
You won't smell burning flesh
from the cigarettes being put to her body

27:23.058 --> 27:26.519
-on Hawaii Five-O."
-I'm not arguing prosecution strategies.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.980
-I'm simply--
-And I'm not done talking.

27:29.939 --> 27:33.526
My point is that when you go
from an abstract idea of murder

27:33.610 --> 27:35.445
to the visceral reality,

27:35.528 --> 27:37.489
you can no longer be objective.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.909
Only when you feel the pain
of those victims and their loved ones

27:40.992 --> 27:44.412
can you know the magnitude
of the choice that killer made.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.416
-And it's that choice that seals his fate.
-[Carr] There's no reason to kill people

27:48.500 --> 27:50.752
when we have the wherewithal
to lock them up.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.838
These people spend the rest of their lives
in horrendous conditions,

27:53.922 --> 27:56.424
which likely reflect the environments
in which they were raised.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.095
Maybe-- I'm sorry. But maybe instead
of debating the pros and cons of--

28:00.178 --> 28:02.639
Yes, cut to the point.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.017
Are you actually asking me
to shoot lower than capital punishment

28:06.101 --> 28:08.645
so it won't reflect poorly on the FBI?

28:09.771 --> 28:13.691
Not the FBI,
our work in Behavioral Science.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.152
If it's compromised,

28:16.236 --> 28:18.780
I'm afraid we won't be able to achieve
our ultimate goal,

28:18.863 --> 28:23.118
which is to hopefully prevent
this type of crime from being committed.

28:24.703 --> 28:29.624
I am asking you to consider
life without the possibility of parole.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.923
I'm an elected official.

28:37.465 --> 28:40.301
Here in Georgia,
death is the will of the people.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.595
And if you don't want
to be involved publicly,

28:42.679 --> 28:45.265
then maybe you should keep yourselves
out of the news.

29:08.371 --> 29:09.456
What did you expect?

29:09.539 --> 29:10.874
A reasonable conversation.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.961
[scoffs]
I don't know what I expected. I...

29:16.629 --> 29:18.840
I've spent months of my life and...

29:20.800 --> 29:22.677
I had hoped that we could
complete our research

29:22.761 --> 29:25.764
-before seeing it used to this end.
-What difference would that make?

29:25.847 --> 29:28.183
I wouldn't have to be in meetings
like the one we had.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.934
So you could walk away clean?

29:30.018 --> 29:32.604
Come on, Wendy. You're smarter than that.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.064
Evidently not.

29:37.650 --> 29:40.862
There's no way around the death penalty
in death penalty states.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.865
Which doesn't mean
what we're doing is wrong.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.969
[doorbell rings]

30:07.013 --> 30:08.890
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.684
It's so nice out.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.187
How was your trip?

30:14.270 --> 30:16.356
Hot. Sticky. Miserable.

30:16.439 --> 30:17.273
Georgia.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.568
-Have you eaten?
-No.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.445
Great. You want to get something?

30:24.614 --> 30:26.199
It's getting late, we should get going.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.867
No, I don't think so.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.036
Okay.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.335
Are you still mad?

30:38.711 --> 30:39.629
Are you...

30:40.505 --> 30:41.714
What exactly are you?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.550
Must I be something?

30:49.430 --> 30:52.058
These past couple days,
I keep thinking about when we met.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.062
You were so sweet.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.272
And curious.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.523
I'm still...

30:59.274 --> 31:00.191
curious.

31:00.942 --> 31:01.901
No.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.070
You're different.

31:04.153 --> 31:07.490
I am the exact same person
that you reeled in with that jumpsuit.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.867
I don't think that's true.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.327
But I'm not the same either.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.413
Where you going with this?

31:13.955 --> 31:15.915
Just... thinking, talking.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.500
Thinking about...?

31:19.335 --> 31:21.170
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

31:21.629 --> 31:22.672
I don't know.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.757
[sighs] Jesus, Debbie. Come on.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.634
You're so good at reading people...

31:27.802 --> 31:28.720
you tell me.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.555
[scoffs]

31:33.766 --> 31:34.767
Okay.

31:35.643 --> 31:36.769
Well...

31:37.854 --> 31:40.106
when I first got here,
you didn't get up to greet me.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.860
And you didn't invite me inside,
but you won't come to dinner with me.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.237
You've been sitting
with your arms crossed,

31:46.321 --> 31:48.948
which I know, from you, is a bad sign.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.911
You've been in a shitty mood
the last ten times we've been together,

31:52.994 --> 31:54.829
and you're always starting arguments,

31:54.913 --> 31:57.999
and you've been assessing me
in a very negative light.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.501
And in spite of your recent confusion
about your degree,

32:00.585 --> 32:02.337
you stay up late every night
doing homework,

32:02.462 --> 32:04.088
leaving me to go to bed alone.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.760
When I got here,
you offered a sip of your wine,

32:08.843 --> 32:10.470
which could be construed as welcoming,

32:10.553 --> 32:12.639
but even though you knew
I was coming from the airport,

32:12.722 --> 32:14.140
you didn't bring an extra glass,

32:14.807 --> 32:16.351
and half the bottle is gone.

32:16.809 --> 32:21.731
Which means you're trying to take
the edge off so that you can...

32:25.151 --> 32:26.277
break up with me?

32:32.367 --> 32:33.785
Is that what I'm doing?

32:36.621 --> 32:39.248
Let's not drag this out.
I'll pick up my stuff next week.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.252
I'll let you know when,
in case you don't want to be here.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.178
[Gregg] Yes, ma'am.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.639
No, we're trying. It's slow.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.182
-Yes, indeed.
-You take this?

33:50.611 --> 33:52.196
[line ringing]

33:56.075 --> 33:58.453
[man] California Medical Facility,
Vacaville. How may I help you?

33:58.578 --> 34:02.790
I got a message to call a Dr... Bruxton.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.376
-One moment, please.
-Did you see who put this here?

34:06.002 --> 34:07.462
I just got in myself.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.130
[man 2] ICU.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.925
Hello, I'm trying to reach a Dr. Bruxton.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.470
I believe Dr. Bruxton is in surgery.

34:15.553 --> 34:19.265
Well... I have a message to return his--

34:19.390 --> 34:20.391
One moment.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.944
Dr. Bruxton isn't available right now.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.530
I'm with the FBI, my name is Holden Ford.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.949
Oh, yes, he is expecting your call.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.619
Can you tell me what this is about?

34:39.702 --> 34:43.081
Uh, you're listed as medical proxy
to one of our patients.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.753
I'm sorry, there must be
some kind of mistake.

34:49.504 --> 34:53.257
I don't think so. Edmund Kemper
specifically named you as his proxy.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.969
At this point, though,
he is out of danger.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.554
Danger?

34:58.679 --> 35:01.516
Mr. Kemper tried to take
his own life last night.

35:03.726 --> 35:05.520
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.482
[stammers] That's impossible.
I can't think that--

35:09.565 --> 35:11.859
Mr. Kemper came out of surgery
at 4:30 a.m.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.861
He's doing well, he's in recovery.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.326
-Hello?
-You need anything from me?

35:20.451 --> 35:22.578
-The doctor will call if we need anything.
-Okay.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.003
It seems
the Office of Professional Responsibility

35:31.129 --> 35:34.966
has found continuing evidence
for their investigation into our unit.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.342
"Continuing evidence"?

35:36.467 --> 35:37.802
They've got the tape.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.597
-How the hell'd they get that?
-I have no idea.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.935
But you three have been called
to meet with them.

35:46.018 --> 35:49.564
And since someone
has taken the high road for us,

35:50.773 --> 35:53.901
I recommend we all go forward
with total transparency.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.122
Is this you?

36:07.832 --> 36:09.000
Fuck you, Bill.

36:36.485 --> 36:37.820
[man] Please state your name.

36:38.070 --> 36:40.072
[Holden] Special Agent Holden Ford.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.367
[man] In what capacity do you serve
the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

36:43.868 --> 36:45.870
I work in the Behavioral Science Unit.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.039
You and Special Agent William Tench

36:48.122 --> 36:50.750
recently interviewed an inmate
named Richard Speck?

36:50.833 --> 36:53.169
-That's right.
-Did you record the interview?

36:53.252 --> 36:55.379
-Yes.
-Which of you recorded the interview?

36:55.463 --> 36:56.380
I did.

36:57.089 --> 37:00.009
You and Agent Tench interviewed
several inmates over the past few months.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.136
-Did you record those, too?
-Yes.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.305
-Who did the recording?
-I did.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.681
For what purpose?

37:05.765 --> 37:08.643
Archival purposes, documentation.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.062
-Is this trying, Agent Ford?
-I'm sorry?

37:11.145 --> 37:13.481
Do you find this process trying?

37:13.564 --> 37:14.857
I find it unnecessary.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.528
What did you do with the recording
when you returned to Quantico?

37:19.612 --> 37:21.906
I gave it to Agent Smith to transcribe it.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.116
-Did he transcribe it?
-Yes.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.619
-And did you look it over?
-Yes.

37:26.702 --> 37:28.621
Did you then decide it should be redacted?

37:28.704 --> 37:29.914
Yes.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.457
[man] Why did you decide that?

37:31.999 --> 37:37.838
I felt there was a section that might be
deemed sensitive by other parties.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.424
"Other parties" meaning whom?

37:40.508 --> 37:42.677
Other people at the FBI.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.138
And people at the LEAA,
which provides our funding.

37:47.014 --> 37:48.140
What section was this?

37:48.599 --> 37:50.768
The section where I asked Speck
why he took

37:50.851 --> 37:54.146
"eight ripe cunts out of this world."

37:54.230 --> 37:56.357
You suddenly thought
that might not go over well.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.441
That's right.

37:58.693 --> 38:01.570
-Did anyone influence your decision?
-No.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.323
Your partner, Agent Tench.
Did he influence your decision?

38:04.407 --> 38:06.158
I made the decision on my own.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.245
What happened once you decided
this section was too sensitive

38:09.328 --> 38:11.080
to appear in the transcript?

38:11.163 --> 38:13.165
I asked Agent Smith to take it out.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.918
-Are you Agent Smith's supervisor?
-No.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.712
Who knew about the redaction
at this point?

38:17.795 --> 38:20.715
I knew, Agent Smith, and Agent Tench.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.759
When the three of you met with us
to discuss Speck's complaint,

38:23.843 --> 38:26.512
whose decision was it to bring us
only the redacted transcript?

38:26.595 --> 38:28.055
It was my decision.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.765
-An unspoken agreement?
-[Holden] Yes.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.476
Did you ask Agent Smith
to lie about erasing the tape?

38:32.560 --> 38:35.187
-Not in so many words.
-What does that mean?

38:35.271 --> 38:36.772
I looked at him.

38:36.897 --> 38:38.941
I asked him to lie with my eyes.

38:40.526 --> 38:44.447
Did the redaction become known to other
people in the Behavioral Science Unit?

38:44.530 --> 38:45.531
[laughs softly]

38:46.490 --> 38:49.869
-[man] Is this amusing, Agent Ford?
-It might be, if it weren't so feeble.

38:49.952 --> 38:50.828
I beg your pardon?

38:50.911 --> 38:53.581
You think I don't know what you're doing
with this principal's office bullshit?

38:53.664 --> 38:56.959
This is what I do with violent offenders,
only much better.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.920
Agent Ford, you stand accused
of lying to the FBI.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.214
Do you realize how serious that is?

39:02.298 --> 39:05.343
You used your badge to gain access
to the California Medical Facility

39:05.426 --> 39:06.719
without any official approval.

39:06.802 --> 39:10.181
To interview our first subject, Kemper,
whose feedback launched our program.

39:10.264 --> 39:13.225
We're not concerned
with what you consider your achievements.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.435
We're concerned with your methods.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.897
The language used with Richard Speck
in the unredacted interview

39:17.980 --> 39:19.815
reflects extremely poorly on the Bureau.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.484
How about calling him a shit stain?

39:24.028 --> 39:27.198
-You see what I mean.
-Agent, listen to what we're telling you.

39:27.656 --> 39:31.952
Flashing your badge is one thing,
suppression of evidence is serious.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.789
You're developing a pattern of behavior
that will not sustain you.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.332
I just got back from Georgia,

39:36.415 --> 39:39.043
where my behavior
led to the arrest and confession

39:39.126 --> 39:41.962
of a man who raped and murdered
a 12-year-old girl.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.589
Surely my partner told you about that.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.342
Your partner expressed reservations
about the way you handle yourself.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.219
You're playing us off each other.

39:48.302 --> 39:51.764
He substantiates our concerns
about your comportment as a federal agent.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.974
We have that on tape.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.142
Fuck this.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.813
If you leave, I can't help you.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.567
I have to write a report on this.
It will go down on your permanent record.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.945
You're making a terrible mistake.

40:06.028 --> 40:09.490
The only mistake I made
was ever doubting myself.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.502
What'd you tell them, Bill?

40:23.212 --> 40:24.505
I told them the truth.

About us, I should say.

The story was picked up by the AP.

43:19.013 --> 43:22.766
In the context of our work together, sure.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.268
Our work together.

43:24.893 --> 43:28.689
That's a nice way of putting it.
I'd categorize it the same way.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.110
And yet, our work is unfinished.

43:33.611 --> 43:36.322
-Okay.
-As I indicated in my letters.

You have more...

43:40.034 --> 43:41.285
insights?

43:41.368 --> 43:42.202
I do.

43:44.038 --> 43:47.291
Well, I'm not going to trot them out
like some kind of show pony,

43:47.374 --> 43:50.085

about me in my absence,

43:50.210 --> 43:53.213

to legitimize yourself.

43:53.839 --> 43:55.382
That story was not...

43:58.302 --> 44:01.513
I... had had a bit to drink.

44:02.348 --> 44:05.643
What's this behavioral profiling
you're touting?

44:06.935 --> 44:07.936
Well...

44:12.691 --> 44:16.028
it's a way to determine
a criminal's psychology

44:16.111 --> 44:19.406
based on crime scenes
and personal characteristics.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.075
I love that.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.412
What's my psychology?

44:25.496 --> 44:27.498
I can't really tell you that.

44:27.581 --> 44:29.416
You can't or you won't?

44:29.500 --> 44:32.878
-It's shoptalk, Ed.
-My favorite.

44:33.754 --> 44:35.631
We're at an early point in the research.

44:35.714 --> 44:39.301
Not so early that you can't babble
about it in the press.

44:39.385 --> 44:42.971
And you pretty much admit
that I started you down this path.

44:43.055 --> 44:47.685
So... I believe you owe me
an explanation, Holden.

44:51.647 --> 44:54.233
You're what we'd call
an organized killer.

44:54.316 --> 44:55.442
Mm-hmm.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.821
Because of the extreme planning
that went into your crimes.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.241
You practiced picking up women
several times

45:02.324 --> 45:04.159
before selecting your first victim.

45:04.284 --> 45:05.411
You used your own vehicle

45:05.494 --> 45:07.871
both in the kidnapping
and disposing of the bodies.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.374
You followed your crimes in the media,

45:10.457 --> 45:13.794
which shows evidence
of continued fantasy.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.130
Mm-hmm.

45:18.590 --> 45:19.800
That's the gist.

45:20.300 --> 45:23.512
You think you can boil me down
to a single adjective?

45:23.595 --> 45:27.975
Of course not.
It's merely a way to sort characteristics.

45:28.058 --> 45:30.060
-You're an expert now.
-No.

45:30.644 --> 45:33.522
-Sounds like it.
-I am not an expert.

45:34.022 --> 45:36.108
But you want to be, don't you?

45:42.156 --> 45:43.365
Yes.

45:57.212 --> 45:59.047
What are you doing, Ed?

45:59.131 --> 46:01.925
Someone left a ballpoint pen
on my court file.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.927
I used the metal casing.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.849
Is this what you wanted to see?

46:10.225 --> 46:11.935
Why would I want to see that?

46:14.354 --> 46:16.064
Take a closer look.

46:22.070 --> 46:23.947
That's okay. Really.

46:28.494 --> 46:31.622
You know, women were initially
indifferent to me.

46:32.956 --> 46:35.209
They weren't interested in sharing.

46:37.002 --> 46:40.005
My whole life,
no one wanted to interact with me.

46:40.088 --> 46:42.966
Not even our cats, when I was a kid.

46:48.805 --> 46:50.057
[chain clanks loudly]

46:55.270 --> 47:00.150
The only way I could have those girls
was to kill them, and it worked.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.862
They became my spirit wives.
They're still with me.

47:07.908 --> 47:13.038
Funny thing in the ICU,
there's no system to alert the guards.

47:13.914 --> 47:17.709
It's short-sighted,
seeing what kind of people come through.

47:19.419 --> 47:22.047
I could kill you now, pretty easily.

47:23.131 --> 47:26.510

before anyone showed up.

47:28.470 --> 47:30.597

47:33.517 --> 47:36.728
I invited you many times to visit,

47:36.853 --> 47:40.399
but even with this,
I never thought you'd actually come.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.069

47:47.239 --> 47:48.240
