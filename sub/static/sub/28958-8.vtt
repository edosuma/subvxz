WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:02.630
My name is Talon.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.296
I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.720
I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.

00:06.760 --> 00:09.720
I cut off the points of my
ears to hide in plain sight.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.850
A tiny creature lives inside me,

00:11.900 --> 00:13.730
passed to me by my dying mother.

00:13.770 --> 00:16.600
It gives me the power to open
portals to another world

00:16.640 --> 00:19.120
and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Qiri.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.390
But I can only summon them
when I have their names,

00:21.430 --> 00:23.650
something that's proving
to be a challenge.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.560
The Prime Order wants me dead,
but I've found sanctuary

00:26.610 --> 00:29.830
at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.830
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:31.870 --> 00:34.490
Why are you doing this?
I'm trying to help you and Gwynn.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.880
- I will deal with her next.
- You're cured. How do you feel?

00:37.920 --> 00:39.142
Please, oh, please let me go!

00:39.143 --> 00:41.270
These flowers only seem
to open up in the daytime.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.800
I'm the traitor.
I'm the spy.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.020
You released Ambassador Dred,
who then killed my Garret.

00:47.060 --> 00:50.460
- Execute her at once.
- Welcome, cousin Milus.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.590
What if I were to give you
all of Tobin's land?

00:52.630 --> 00:57.290
Tobin won't need any land,
as he'll be married to the Queen.

00:57.330 --> 00:59.950
- You're not coming with me, are you?
- You know I can't.

00:59.990 --> 01:04.080
This key unlocks a great power that could solve
the problems of our people and your Queen.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.300
I know where we can find
the missing piece to the key.

01:06.340 --> 01:09.610
There are people here who are trying
to harm you. Now we need to leave.

01:09.650 --> 01:12.700
- I'm so glad that you're alive.
- You knew I was alive.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.660
You just didn't care.

01:33.410 --> 01:34.940
Garret, where are we going?

01:37.980 --> 01:39.900
Garret, you're scaring me.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.300
Garret?

01:47.510 --> 01:49.170
Garret, what is going on?

02:01.960 --> 02:04.360
What are you doing?

02:04.400 --> 02:07.450
- I am your queen.
- You're a traitor.

02:07.490 --> 02:10.320
Tie her up.

02:41.610 --> 02:44.570
We should have carried on
to get the jewel.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.376
I told you we'd be too late
to save your queen.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.490
Just stop.

02:48.530 --> 02:49.920
We're not too late.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.360
I can't be.

03:13.690 --> 03:14.690
More.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.390
More! Keep it coming.
Come on.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.520
I thought you gave up
on the drink.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.610
Let me ask you something,
barkeep.

03:23.260 --> 03:24.830
If the woman you were
supposed to marry

03:24.870 --> 03:26.130
left you at the altar,

03:26.180 --> 03:27.196
just run off with another man,

03:27.220 --> 03:29.400
would you stay sober?

03:29.440 --> 03:32.450
I don't like to get drunk,
but I see your point.

03:41.110 --> 03:42.410
Talon, thank gods you're back.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.280
- Where's Gwynn?
- Not here.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.460
You're going to want
to sit down for this

03:46.500 --> 03:47.656
because you are not going to
believe what I'm about to tell you.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.250
Janzo, we don't
have time for this.

03:49.290 --> 03:50.436
- All right, where is she?
- Fine, suit yourself.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.030
Have it your way.

03:52.070 --> 03:55.120
Garret is alive.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.080
- I know.
- You know?

03:57.120 --> 03:58.860
Look, he's after Gwynn.
I have to stop him.

03:58.910 --> 04:00.600
Too late.
She's already gone with him.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.650
- What?
- Wait, what do you mean, stop him?

04:02.690 --> 04:04.456
You mean stop him from
getting married to Gwynn?

04:04.480 --> 04:06.416
He doesn't want to marry her.
He wants to kill her.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.570
- What?
- He tried to kill me.

04:08.610 --> 04:10.610
Stabbed me right in the gut.
I barely survived.

04:10.660 --> 04:11.896
Sorry, Garret wouldn't do that.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.140
It's not Garret anymore.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.296
They played with his mind.
He serves the Prime Order now.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.839
- He said, "Hail to The Three."
- I knew it.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.516
I should have stopped them.
I should never have let her go with him.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.980
- Which way did they go?
- They left on the main road.

04:24.020 --> 04:26.370
- When?
- Yesterday.

04:26.410 --> 04:29.330
Yesterday? What, they've
been gone all night?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.370
- Why didn't anyone go after them?
- It was Garret.

04:31.420 --> 04:32.916
No one was gonna suspect
anything, were they?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.656
Everyone was just so happy
that he was alive.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.706
- I have to stop them.
- And where are you going to go?

04:36.730 --> 04:37.926
You have no idea
where you're going.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.340
He's probably taking her
to The Three,

04:40.380 --> 04:42.340
if he hasn't killed her already.

04:42.390 --> 04:44.210
Right.

04:44.260 --> 04:46.100
I'm going to summon
some guards to go with you.

04:46.130 --> 04:48.170
No.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.090
Gwynn stands a better chance
of staying alive

04:50.130 --> 04:52.026
if Garret doesn't think
a whole army is after him.

04:52.050 --> 04:54.220
- Then I'm coming with you.
- No. I'm faster alone.

04:54.270 --> 04:56.530
- Besides, you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

04:56.570 --> 04:59.230
Nice reaction time.

04:59.270 --> 05:01.190
Like I said, drunk.

05:01.230 --> 05:03.540
Okay, that wasn't fair.
You should have warned me.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.150
Why would I warn you?
Garret won't.

05:05.190 --> 05:06.840
If they reach the fort
by Mill's Bend,

05:06.890 --> 05:08.296
then Garret's going to have
a whole contingent

05:08.320 --> 05:10.940
of Prime Order to back him up.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.396
- You can't go alone, Talon.
- Look, I don't have time for this.

05:13.420 --> 05:16.510
- I have someone else to help me.
- Talon. Talon!

05:19.420 --> 05:22.430
Okay.

05:22.470 --> 05:25.300
Look, she can probably beat him,

05:25.340 --> 05:27.390
especially given
his current condition.

05:27.430 --> 05:30.260
But if he is joined up by a
contingent of Covenant guards,

05:30.300 --> 05:32.700
then not even Talon
can take them on alone.

05:32.740 --> 05:36.790
This is why
I need to go with her.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.620
All right! Aeglesberry,
let's go sober you up!

05:41.100 --> 05:43.400
First, I will make you
a sobering tonic.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.580
That will take you
halfway there.

05:45.620 --> 05:49.100
Then hopefully time
will take care of the rest.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.070
Garret's got Gwynn.

05:55.110 --> 05:56.280
They left yesterday

05:56.330 --> 05:57.736
and have about
a half day's ride on us.

05:57.760 --> 06:02.770
Us? I'm not going
with you, Talon.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.656
Look, I know you're upset
I made us turn back yesterday,

06:04.680 --> 06:05.926
but trust me, as soon as Gwynn...

06:05.950 --> 06:07.690
You speak an awful lot of trust.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.300
It's starting to wear on me.

06:09.340 --> 06:12.300
Look, I trust you,
I just don't trust your queen,

06:12.340 --> 06:16.090
and I'm not going to risk
my neck to save her again.

06:16.130 --> 06:17.676
Frankly, I don't know
why you want to go after her.

06:17.700 --> 06:18.766
She hasn't treated you
much better.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.960
She is my Queen.

06:21.010 --> 06:24.230
And my friend.

06:24.270 --> 06:25.920
I don't have time
to argue with you.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.750
I wish you well, I do.
I just... this isn't my fight.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
I am coming with you!

07:08.100 --> 07:09.450
No, you're not.

07:09.490 --> 07:12.490
You're drunk.

07:12.540 --> 07:15.970
- You'll slow me down.
- I'm not as drunk.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.670
And by the time
we catch up with them,

07:20.720 --> 07:22.460
I'll be totally sober.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.330
Ooh.

07:32.290 --> 07:35.910
So we're saying two
on one horse.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.650
One's in full armor.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.560
I'm willing to wager they've
made camp for the night.

07:42.220 --> 07:45.480
We'll find them.
We'll catch up with them.

07:47.570 --> 07:50.050
You seem different.

07:50.090 --> 07:51.920
Just sober.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.360
She left you
on your wedding day.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.540
- During your wedding.
- I'm aware.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.100
And after all that,
you still want to rescue her?

08:00.150 --> 08:03.460
Look, I'm no stranger
to making mistakes, all right?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.540
And that Queen of ours
has given both you and me

08:05.590 --> 08:07.550
more than a few chances
to get things right.

08:07.590 --> 08:09.940
I figured I owe her
the same courtesy.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.380
Can't argue with that.

08:37.620 --> 08:39.360
I need to hear you say it.

08:42.100 --> 08:46.980
I need to hear you
confess your lies.

08:47.020 --> 08:49.410
Hmm?

08:49.460 --> 08:51.760
You're thirsty, aren't you?

08:55.640 --> 08:58.210
You know, I can...

08:58.250 --> 09:00.640
I could take that gag off

09:00.690 --> 09:03.600
and give you food, water.

09:03.650 --> 09:05.690
And all you have to do...

09:09.520 --> 09:11.870
is admit the truth.

09:11.920 --> 09:17.750
That you are no queen.

09:17.790 --> 09:22.750
That you and Calkussar
lied to me.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.410
You lied to everyone who was
fool enough to believe in you

09:25.450 --> 09:31.410
because you were power hungry,
greedy traitors.

09:31.460 --> 09:34.420
Can you do that? Hmm?

09:34.460 --> 09:37.160
Can you spit the truth

09:37.200 --> 09:39.990
out of this venomous
little mouth of yours

09:40.030 --> 09:42.950
and be honest with me for once?

09:45.040 --> 09:49.210
Say it. Say it!

09:49.260 --> 09:51.000
Say the words!

09:51.040 --> 09:54.440
Admit your falsehood.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.090
Set me free. Set me free.

09:59.830 --> 10:02.970
Set yourself free.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.140
Yes?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.580
Yeah?

10:08.620 --> 10:10.450
Help!

10:10.500 --> 10:12.150
No!

10:12.190 --> 10:14.240
No.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.240
Now you can scream
all you want, traitor,

10:18.290 --> 10:22.330
but there is no one here
to help you!

10:26.120 --> 10:27.470
All right?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.300
Shh.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.090
Shh.

10:53.230 --> 10:54.346
There's six guards and Garret.

10:54.370 --> 10:57.370
They must be packing up.

10:57.410 --> 10:59.280
We're out of time.

10:59.330 --> 11:00.720
All right, well,
we could sneak in.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.680
I'll go through the front.
You scale the side...

11:05.380 --> 11:07.680
I'm not one for plans myself.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.130
A crown for the Queen.

11:40.930 --> 11:42.890
Guards!

11:42.940 --> 11:44.760
Stay with me and the prisoner.

11:44.810 --> 11:47.290
The rest of you, kill her.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.160
Leaving so soon?

12:38.210 --> 12:40.300
I didn't take you for a coward.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.520
Get up.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.740
Get on the horse.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.970
Tobin, he's got Gwynn!

13:40.010 --> 13:41.840
I thought you were gone already.

13:45.490 --> 13:47.130
- And they've got an archer.
- Go already!

13:49.670 --> 13:51.670
We're outnumbered!

13:51.720 --> 13:55.370
I love being outnumbered.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.200
Get out of here, Gwynn!

14:51.600 --> 14:53.780
- I don't want to kill you.
- Don't worry.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.430
You won't have to!

15:19.460 --> 15:20.850
Talon!

15:20.890 --> 15:23.200
Talon, are you trying
to kill him?

15:26.810 --> 15:28.250
He's just unconscious.

16:40.060 --> 16:43.410
Nice shot.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.030
Tobin?

16:54.900 --> 16:57.030
Tobin?

16:57.080 --> 16:58.690
Talon, what do we do?

17:00.250 --> 17:04.130
I don't know.
What would Janzo do?

17:09.260 --> 17:10.920
Talon!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.490
I'm gonna need you
to pull out the arrow.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.970
- What? No.
- Yes, now.

17:26.930 --> 17:29.060
After this, we drink.

17:29.110 --> 17:31.200
- It's all right.
- Like, hell I am.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.030
I need you to do that
three more times.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.730
Talon.
Talon, what are you doing?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.000
All right. Are you ready?

17:52.740 --> 17:55.920
So, Janzo, you think these pretty
little things are the cure?

17:55.960 --> 17:57.920
I don't know, Munt.
That's one theory.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.270
Mmm. They smell as nice
as they look.

18:00.310 --> 18:01.920
Have you smelled them?

18:01.970 --> 18:05.270
Stop!

18:05.320 --> 18:08.710
Angry again.
Janzo, why are you angry?

18:08.760 --> 18:12.320
- Why would I be angry, Munt?
- Your girlfriend is a traitor.

18:12.370 --> 18:14.696
The Queen was to have her killed,
but she escaped, now Mum is mad.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.526
The Queen went and got kidnapped by
Garret and then Talon went after them,

18:17.550 --> 18:19.510
which means either
Talon or Garret or Gwynn,

18:19.550 --> 18:21.940
or probably all three of them,
are most likely dead and...

18:21.990 --> 18:24.120
Some of those
I hadn't even thought about.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.600
- Thanks a lot, Munt.
- Oh, you're welcome.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.170
Excuse me.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.650
Sir? Could I trouble you
perhaps to untie me, please?

18:33.690 --> 18:35.300
Good news, right, Janzo?
You did it!

18:35.350 --> 18:38.220
You cured another one.

18:38.260 --> 18:41.140
Yes, apart from that I covered
them both in the same vines

18:41.180 --> 18:42.490
and only one of them's cured.

18:42.530 --> 18:43.896
So what happened this time,
hey, Munt?

18:43.920 --> 18:46.230
Oh, thank you, sir.
You are very kind.

18:46.270 --> 18:48.190
Oh, maybe only polite ones
are cured.

18:48.230 --> 18:51.150
Munt, take him to the Nightshade.
Give him something to eat.

18:51.190 --> 18:54.500
Keep an eye on him.
Make sure he's well and truly cured.

18:54.540 --> 18:57.630
I have to take this to the lab.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.940
- That...
- All right. Come on.

19:00.980 --> 19:01.980
Okay.

19:05.290 --> 19:07.860
You are very kind.
Thank you a lot. Thank you.

19:07.900 --> 19:11.470
Open the gate!

19:11.510 --> 19:14.340
Hold on!
What's all this?

19:14.390 --> 19:16.820
The Queen, she's returned.

19:16.870 --> 19:18.830
Open the damn gate.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.070
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:48.160 --> 19:51.340
Send for Janzo immediately.
Master Tobin is badly injured.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.770
Send him to my quarters.

19:53.820 --> 19:56.390
- Captain Spears?
- Lock him away.

19:56.430 --> 19:58.650
And double the guards.

20:07.270 --> 20:08.400
Get down.

20:34.810 --> 20:37.640
Talon, are all these wounds...
are they all...

20:37.690 --> 20:38.910
Arrows.

20:40.860 --> 20:42.740
Did you cauterize the wounds?

20:42.780 --> 20:46.570
- Mm-hmm.
- Well done.

20:46.610 --> 20:49.050
Did he have to be, um, you know,

20:49.090 --> 20:51.880
distracted when you
did it, like I did?

20:51.920 --> 20:54.270
I didn't kiss him, Janzo.

20:54.310 --> 20:56.010
That's not what I was
suggesting, Talon.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.320
I was just wondering
if he was conscious when...

20:58.360 --> 21:00.320
when you were treating him.

21:01.930 --> 21:03.230
Is he going to be all right?

21:03.280 --> 21:04.280
Mm.

21:09.110 --> 21:10.420
Janzo?

21:19.210 --> 21:21.210
You both did an admirable job.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.560
He's lost a lot of blood.

21:23.600 --> 21:28.090
But, um, some of these wounds
do look a little worrying.

21:28.130 --> 21:30.390
There's nothing more we can do, though.
Now we just wait.

21:35.350 --> 21:36.880
This is all my fault.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.990
Tobin almost died.

22:00.030 --> 22:01.210
Shame.

22:03.210 --> 22:04.560
Could have used your help.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.560
Could've called Vikka
at any moment.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.390
You know his name.

22:07.430 --> 22:10.870
I swore an oath to send
him away and keep him away.

22:10.910 --> 22:13.650
My loyalty and my word mean
something to me, unlike some people.

22:13.700 --> 22:18.700
You seem to be doing just fine
without me or my loyalty.

22:18.740 --> 22:21.050
What is wrong with you?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.880
And why couldn't
you come with me?

22:22.920 --> 22:27.190
- Whose side are you on?
- Whose side are you on?

22:27.230 --> 22:29.320
You say that you want
to help our people,

22:29.360 --> 22:30.996
but every time you have a choice,
you choose to put humans before us.

22:31.020 --> 22:34.460
I put the most urgent need
before anything else.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.760
The key could wait.
Gwynn couldn't.

22:36.810 --> 22:38.290
Our people have waited
long enough.

22:39.940 --> 22:41.200
I know.

22:45.510 --> 22:47.990
I saw it when I went
through the portal.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.950
The air was so thick with ash,
I could barely breathe.

22:50.990 --> 22:54.870
And then Blackbloods,
my own people, attacked me.

22:54.910 --> 22:57.870
- I told you they were Black Fist.
- Blackbloods nonetheless.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.570
How can I expect Gwynn
to trust our people

23:00.610 --> 23:01.960
if I can't even
trust them myself?

23:02.010 --> 23:03.960
The Black Fist
are not your people.

23:04.010 --> 23:05.180
They're not mine either.

23:05.230 --> 23:08.010
Are you at war with them?

23:08.050 --> 23:12.580
- No, but...
- Do you live among them in the Plane of Ash?

23:12.620 --> 23:15.410
- See, you do.
- Talon, you have no idea.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.290
The Plane...

23:23.330 --> 23:25.070
is such a harsh environment.

23:26.550 --> 23:28.770
We were forced to work
together a long time ago,

23:28.810 --> 23:30.340
just to survive.

23:30.380 --> 23:32.210
And why should I believe you?

23:32.250 --> 23:35.040
When your tribe first sent us
through the portal, we...

23:35.080 --> 23:36.520
I thought your tribe
went willingly.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.130
We were tricked...
by the humans.

23:41.310 --> 23:43.790
We had no idea
what awaited us there.

23:46.350 --> 23:48.066
When we first stepped out
onto the other side,

23:48.090 --> 23:50.620
do you know what
the first thing we saw was?

23:50.660 --> 23:52.880
- What?
- Fire worms.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.840
That's what
we called them, anyway.

23:57.890 --> 24:01.240
Like giant red snakes
a thousand hands long,

24:01.280 --> 24:02.850
teeth the size of you and me.

24:02.890 --> 24:04.396
I didn't see any of them
when I went through.

24:04.420 --> 24:07.160
Then you were lucky.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.640
Their hides were so thick our
swords and spears were useless.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.990
And guess who figured out
a way to kill them.

24:14.030 --> 24:16.300
Rebb.

24:16.340 --> 24:17.496
Well, some of her
Black Fist comrades.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.300
And how'd they do it?

24:19.340 --> 24:21.536
Black Fist archers shot bolts
down the creatures' throats.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.430
Killed them from the inside.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.520
They found a way to make our worst
fear our main source of food.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.880
They saved us all, Talon.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.710
So you just proved my point.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.110
You are allies
with the Black Fist.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.320
We hunted together
out of necessity.

24:37.360 --> 24:41.890
They're not our allies. In every
other possible way, they're our enemy.

24:41.930 --> 24:44.630
Some of the things they've
done, Talon, believe me,

24:44.670 --> 24:47.230
I want to keep them outside of
this world just as much as you do.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.680
How'd you survive so long
in that awful place?

24:55.730 --> 24:58.120
Where'd you seek shelter?

24:58.160 --> 24:59.510
We almost died.

25:01.730 --> 25:03.950
Storms of fire
rained down on us.

25:06.260 --> 25:10.130
We found lava tubes that
had cooled, were insulated.

25:10.180 --> 25:12.700
Made our homes in them.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.350
So your people are safe
for the time...

25:14.400 --> 25:16.360
Our people.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.140
Have you not listened
to a word I've just said?

25:19.190 --> 25:20.726
How long do you intend
to leave them there to suffer?

25:20.750 --> 25:24.320
Until the time is right.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.150
If I bring them through now,
it would start an all-out war.

25:28.190 --> 25:30.150
Gwynn needs to know
that she can trust us,

25:30.200 --> 25:31.396
and you would have made it
a whole lot easier

25:31.420 --> 25:34.640
if you helped save her.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.940
So?

25:36.990 --> 25:38.860
If not now, then when?

25:48.610 --> 25:50.650
You said this unlocks
a great power,

25:50.700 --> 25:54.660
something that can help
both humans and Blackbloods.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.140
That's right.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.580
Then let's go get it.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.770
Your Majesty.
I've already spoken with the Mistress

26:21.810 --> 26:23.600
and gave her a full report.

26:27.040 --> 26:31.210
- Where's Naya?
- Actually, she escaped, Your Majesty.

26:33.260 --> 26:35.740
Then you will give me
a full report.

26:35.780 --> 26:39.220
Whoever allowed her to escape
will suffer the consequences,

26:39.270 --> 26:41.856
and I trust we will not repeat
this mistake with Commander Spears.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.710
No, Your Majesty.

26:43.750 --> 26:48.800
Good. Now leave us.
I need a word.

26:48.840 --> 26:53.240
Is this a test or...
or you really want me to...

26:53.280 --> 26:57.020
Right. I'll be in front
of you need anything.

26:57.070 --> 26:58.680
I do, actually.

27:00.070 --> 27:03.640
- Send me Janzo.
- Right, Your Majesty.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.400
You're breaking my heart.

27:28.530 --> 27:29.790
Are you still you?

27:36.320 --> 27:39.500
Does it scare you that I know?

27:39.540 --> 27:41.680
That the Prime Order knows?

27:41.720 --> 27:43.680
What are you talking about?

27:46.720 --> 27:48.680
What have they done
to turn you into this?

27:54.910 --> 27:57.870
They opened my eyes.

27:57.910 --> 28:01.090
I see you now
for what you really are.

28:01.130 --> 28:05.870
- An impostor.
- You sound insane.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.530
The Prime Order
slaughtered my family.

28:08.570 --> 28:10.970
- I am the rightful queen.
- Queen?

28:11.010 --> 28:13.320
No, you are no queen.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.710
You are just a selfish
little girl playing dress-up.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.800
How dare you!

28:21.370 --> 28:24.720
You're about to form a strategic
union through marriage.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.720
You would have gained
thousands of soldiers,

28:26.760 --> 28:29.330
gold to fund your army.

28:29.380 --> 28:31.730
That was smart.

28:31.770 --> 28:36.120
Something a queen would do.
But not you.

28:36.170 --> 28:40.740
You abandoned your own wedding
to run off with your lover,

28:40.780 --> 28:43.350
a commoner with
nothing to offer.

28:44.780 --> 28:47.220
Selfish.

28:47.260 --> 28:51.880
No true queen
would ever behave that way.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.750
You sent for me?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.890
Yes, Janzo, I have
a new task for you.

29:03.190 --> 29:05.590
They've done something to him,

29:05.630 --> 29:07.760
tampered with his mind,
and I need you to fix him.

29:07.810 --> 29:10.030
- Fix him?
- You heard me.

29:10.070 --> 29:13.070
Right. It's just that, um,
well, I've almost found a cure

29:13.120 --> 29:14.706
for the Plaguelings,
so I don't really have time...

29:14.730 --> 29:17.600
Surely, you can find the time
to manage both projects.

29:18.900 --> 29:20.780
I'll move Commander Spears
down to your lab

29:20.820 --> 29:22.300
along with
a contingent of guards

29:22.340 --> 29:23.780
that will stay with you always.

29:23.820 --> 29:25.340
Is he really that dangerous?

29:27.610 --> 29:30.790
They're not just for him.
They're for you as well.

29:30.830 --> 29:34.830
- Your Majesty...
- I would put you in jail right now for freeing Naya,

29:34.880 --> 29:36.180
if I could.

29:36.230 --> 29:39.270
How did you know?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.190
Who else would it be?

29:41.230 --> 29:43.620
Good point.

29:43.670 --> 29:46.280
Unfortunately,
the truth is I need you.

29:46.320 --> 29:50.200
So, you will find a cure for the
Plaguelings, you will heal Tobin,

29:50.240 --> 29:52.810
and you will bring Commander
Spears back to his right mind.

29:52.850 --> 29:55.110
Guards.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.770
And after that?

30:01.250 --> 30:02.900
I will find a sentence fitting

30:02.950 --> 30:04.860
for the man who freed
the traitor of the crown.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.920
And you are certain
this is his seal?

30:17.960 --> 30:19.360
Aye, Your Holiness,

30:19.400 --> 30:23.930
and Garret Spears is captured.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.930
Thank you for your service, sir,

30:26.970 --> 30:29.370
and for your discretion.

30:29.410 --> 30:33.240
- This is unexpected.
- Which part?

30:33.280 --> 30:34.850
That your plan failed?

30:34.890 --> 30:36.760
Or that the Queen
is using her added time

30:36.810 --> 30:38.420
to build a coalition against us?

30:38.460 --> 30:40.940
A coalition crumbling
as we speak.

30:40.990 --> 30:42.770
The Blade of The Three
is captured.

30:42.810 --> 30:46.210
We could have sent
the Covenant army weeks ago,

30:46.250 --> 30:48.560
and the Queen
and her Outpost would be gone.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.080
We should waste no more time.

30:50.130 --> 30:52.520
Summon the generals.

30:52.560 --> 30:56.870
It is time to throw all
of our great might at Rosmund

30:56.910 --> 30:59.130
before she grows even stronger.

31:14.370 --> 31:15.370
All right.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.330
Let's see, shall we?

31:24.070 --> 31:26.380
After your ambush in Dun-ebdin,
where did Dred take you?

31:26.420 --> 31:28.900
To see the Holy Three

31:28.950 --> 31:31.120
and bask in their glory.

31:31.170 --> 31:35.610
Mm-hmm.
Held captive in the Capital.

31:35.650 --> 31:38.520
And how long were you there for?

31:38.560 --> 31:41.480
I stayed until I was ready
to receive my purpose.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.090
So, one moon? Two?

31:45.660 --> 31:50.270
Right, has no sense
of passage of time.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.620
Did you, um, sleep for any
unnaturally long periods of time?

31:53.670 --> 31:55.490
Did you take any potions?
Any pills?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.500
Gwynn is a false queen,

31:57.540 --> 31:59.800
and Talon is a dirty Blackblood

31:59.850 --> 32:01.810
determined to destroy us all.

32:01.850 --> 32:04.720
Oh, so you're not interested
in either of them now, are you?

32:04.760 --> 32:08.640
Janzo, what are you doing?
What is the point?

32:08.680 --> 32:10.550
You heard her.

32:12.820 --> 32:16.170
When all this is done,
they're going to lock you away.

32:16.210 --> 32:19.000
- Or worse.
- Mm. Maybe I deserve it.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.700
Why? You've done nothing wrong.
They duped us all.

32:24.050 --> 32:26.790
No, the only thing
that you deserve

32:26.830 --> 32:29.790
is to be judged
by rightful rulers.

32:29.830 --> 32:31.010
Gwynn is a fraud.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.580
The Prime Order will come

32:32.620 --> 32:34.580
and they will squelch
her uprising,

32:34.620 --> 32:40.580
and when they do, loyal,
brilliant minds such as yourself,

32:40.630 --> 32:42.410
- will be handsomely rewarded.
- Mm-hmm.

32:42.450 --> 32:44.940
Now, let's check
your eyesight, shall we?

32:44.980 --> 32:46.760
- Can you read this?
- "Shut up."

32:50.940 --> 32:52.860
Perfect vision.

32:56.030 --> 32:57.210
I'll be back.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.740
Well, move!

33:13.660 --> 33:16.010
New hire?

33:16.050 --> 33:17.360
New recruits every day.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.060
I mean, why is he there?

33:25.110 --> 33:27.110
It turns out, Talon,

33:27.150 --> 33:31.330
that Garret isn't
the only one under arrest.

33:31.370 --> 33:33.850
I leave you for a few nights,
and Gwynn's put you under guard?

33:33.900 --> 33:36.900
What in gods did you do?
Experiment with her bath salts?

33:39.250 --> 33:41.860
Naya was the traitor
who let Dred go.

33:41.910 --> 33:45.430
- Naya.
- And then Gwynn sentenced her to death, and then...

33:45.470 --> 33:48.830
Please don't tell me
you helped her escape.

33:48.870 --> 33:51.106
- The Prime Order was holding her family hostage.
- Janzo.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.260
She didn't want to do it.

33:52.310 --> 33:55.530
She didn't want
to be a spy, Talon.

33:55.570 --> 33:57.310
I'm in big trouble, aren't I?

33:59.100 --> 34:02.670
If you let Naya go,
I'm sure you had good reason.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.670
Gwynn will come to understand.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.710
I'm not so sure.

34:12.070 --> 34:14.020
Now I'm almost afraid
to leave again.

34:14.070 --> 34:16.159
- What new treason will you commit?
- Talon!

34:16.199 --> 34:19.510
I'm teasing him.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.900
But seriously,

34:21.949 --> 34:23.380
stay out of trouble
while I'm gone.

34:23.429 --> 34:24.600
Do you have to go?

34:27.040 --> 34:29.560
I do.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.429
I've been doing
some more research for you.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.480
Do you remember the pendant

34:33.520 --> 34:36.130
that was on the necklace
the Dragman gave you?

34:36.179 --> 34:38.699
I think it's a key that belongs
to a shrine called Vor-Anden.

34:38.739 --> 34:40.880
However, it's missing a piece.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.489
- The gemstone.
- Yes.

34:43.530 --> 34:45.076
I know where to find
the missing piece to the key.

34:45.100 --> 34:46.880
And thanks to you,

34:46.929 --> 34:48.255
I know where I have to go
after I get it.

34:48.280 --> 34:52.239
Talon, Vor-Anden,
it's on the border,

34:52.280 --> 34:56.280
and the Prime Order patrols
scour the entire Realm.

34:56.330 --> 34:57.526
Not to mention,
there's also the Greyskins...

34:57.550 --> 34:59.770
Janzo, we'll be fine.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.940
You know, I really wish
I can come with you, Talon.

35:04.990 --> 35:07.730
You belong here.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.510
Gwynn needs you,

35:09.560 --> 35:11.820
even though she's not very
fond of you at the moment.

35:18.390 --> 35:20.000
He's down there.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.920
I need to speak to him.

35:24.230 --> 35:25.920
Alone.

35:45.070 --> 35:46.550
Talon.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.550
Talon, I'm so glad
you're alive and well.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.080
I... I wanted to apologize.

35:53.120 --> 35:57.520
I see now that something
is wrong with me.

35:57.560 --> 36:01.350
The way I've been behaving, I...

36:01.390 --> 36:03.700
I don't know.

36:03.740 --> 36:05.660
They got in my head. They...

36:08.050 --> 36:11.190
- That's for Gwynn.
- Oh, you filthy Blackblood!

36:16.670 --> 36:18.540
And that's for me.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.960
Please be all right.

36:55.880 --> 37:01.240
So this is what it takes
to finally get into your bed.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.190
Do you need something?

37:04.240 --> 37:05.646
- I should call for Gertrusha.
- No, no, no.

37:05.670 --> 37:07.680
No, please.

37:07.720 --> 37:11.030
Let me have this moment
of silence with you.

37:11.070 --> 37:12.900
I don't need anything.

37:12.940 --> 37:16.290
Maybe just a new body.

37:16.340 --> 37:19.950
One that hurts less.

37:19.990 --> 37:23.430
Please sit down with me.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.690
I'm not going to get handsy.

37:25.740 --> 37:27.390
I can barely move my arms.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.190
I wanted to thank you...

37:40.230 --> 37:41.450
for coming to get me.

37:41.490 --> 37:42.670
Mm.

37:42.710 --> 37:44.670
Especially considering I...

37:44.710 --> 37:48.460
That you ran off with
another man on our wedding day.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.890
- Yes, that.
- Mm.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.396
How are you feeling
about that choice?

37:53.420 --> 37:56.120
- Stupid.
- Mm.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.550
- Selfish.
- Mm.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.820
Unworthy.

37:59.860 --> 38:02.640
Unworthy?

38:02.690 --> 38:06.130
- Of what?
- Of you.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.650
What you did.

38:07.690 --> 38:09.870
Of Talon's friendship.

38:09.910 --> 38:12.650
- The crown.
- Don't beat yourself up.

38:12.700 --> 38:15.130
Only one of us can be
wounded at a time.

38:19.660 --> 38:22.140
Tobin, we need to talk
about our deal,

38:22.190 --> 38:24.320
- about what I did.
- Shh.

38:26.540 --> 38:32.200
Don't spoil this
with talks of deals and lands.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.550
Can I just have
this moment with you?

38:52.390 --> 38:53.390
Come in.

38:59.740 --> 39:02.700
I hear you're leaving again.

39:02.750 --> 39:04.180
I made a promise.

39:04.230 --> 39:07.540
Yeah, well, make a lot
of promises, Talon.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.670
And I do my best to keep them.

39:09.710 --> 39:13.320
I know.

39:13.370 --> 39:17.550
But I thank you
for saving me again.

39:17.590 --> 39:18.720
Twice.

39:20.810 --> 39:24.420
But I have to go.

39:24.470 --> 39:28.080
I don't understand why you have
to go on this errand with Zed.

39:28.120 --> 39:32.560
- I don't trust him.
- I'm not sure I do either, but he's a Blackblood.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.146
Talon, did you ever wonder
why your mother didn't try

39:34.170 --> 39:35.610
and bring back the Blackbloods?

39:38.040 --> 39:40.570
I've thought about it.

39:40.610 --> 39:42.376
It's possible she didn't
know any more than I do.

39:42.400 --> 39:45.920
Maybe she knew more.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.620
I have to figure this one out.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.760
Be safe, Talon.

40:10.290 --> 40:12.600
- Supper.
- Hmm.

40:16.300 --> 40:19.820
I know every guard
in the Outpost.

40:19.870 --> 40:23.260
- Don't know you.
- I'm new, Commander.

40:23.310 --> 40:26.050
Soldier, he's no longer
a commander.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.880
He's a prisoner.
You owe no respect.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.620
Of course.

40:38.580 --> 40:39.710
Right.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.820
You look worried.

41:38.860 --> 41:41.520
I thought something more
important might have come up.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.910
Nothing is more
important to me now.

41:43.950 --> 41:47.830
- I promise.
- As you've said over and over again.

41:47.870 --> 41:49.910
Too many times.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.050
Your promises matter to you?

41:52.090 --> 41:54.220
- They do.
- All right, then.
