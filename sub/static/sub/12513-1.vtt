00:31.365 --> 00:33.575
{y:i}I was born in Palermo, Sicily.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.287
{y:i}We came to this country when I was seven.
{y:i}We immigrated to Chicago.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.999
{y:i}We were always raised to be very patriotic,
{y:i}to love our country.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.501
{y:i}And we did.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.421
{y:i}When I was a little boy,
{y:i}my father took me to a baseball game.

00:46.505 --> 00:50.300
{y:i}They had a martial arts demonstration
{y:i}and I saw this old Japanese man...

00:50.384 --> 00:53.512
{y:i}... doing things that I thought
{y:i}were magical...

00:54.054 --> 00:56.640
{y:i}... and I developed a crazy dream
{y:i}to go to the Far East.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.561
{y:i}By the time I was 17, I was there,
{y:i}studying with the masters.

02:51.088 --> 02:56.134
{y:i}In 1969 I was invited by a friend of mine
{y:i}to an American Embassy party in Tokyo.

02:57.469 --> 03:01.473
{y:i}While I was there, there was a crazy,
{y:i}drunk guy named Nelson Fox.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.767
{y:i}He recruited me into the CIA.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.144
{y:i}I was 22 at the time.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.856
{y:i}My eyes were about to be opened.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.062
{y:i}My friends, let me make one thing clear:

03:49.146 --> 03:51.190
{y:i}This is a nation of laws.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.442
{y:i}And as Abraham Lincoln had said:

03:53.525 --> 03:56.820
{y:i}No one is above the law,
{y:i}no one is below the law."

03:56.904 --> 03:58.739
{y:i}And we're going to enforce the law!

03:58.822 --> 04:03.160
{y:i}And Americans should remember that,
{y:i}if we are to have law and order!

05:16.567 --> 05:19.570
You ever seen
chemical interrogation before?

05:19.862 --> 05:21.822
These assholes are Agency?

05:21.905 --> 05:24.074
We all get paid by the CIA.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.161
But these guys are from a page
that ain't even in the book.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.855
Don't die on me, you sucker!

05:54.938 --> 05:56.857
What the hell's wrong?

05:57.566 --> 06:00.527
This pussy, he just can't hold his liquor.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.282
Doc, he's dead.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.618
Get him the fuck out of here.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.621
- Move it. Let's go.
- Come on!

06:11.371 --> 06:13.874
- Get him out.
- Get him out of here.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.722
So, my little doctor bag doesn't scare you?

06:29.598 --> 06:30.974
I'm not scared.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.685
You speak English.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.562
How nice.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.524
Where's the load, Colonel?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.327
I'm gonna teach you never...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.704
...never to fuck with my opium.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.373
Oh, boy.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.959
He's a hard one, Doc.

06:57.501 --> 07:01.046
You took it from the French,
you took it from the Chinks.

07:01.129 --> 07:05.050
And you'll be damned
if a Yankee's going to start you talking.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.929
But you're gonna sing for me.
You're gonna sing like a choir!

07:09.096 --> 07:12.599
What does this have to do
with military intelligence?

07:16.395 --> 07:18.605
Who the fuck is this cherry?

07:18.981 --> 07:22.276
Your orders, Toscani,
were to assist and observe.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.987
Just back off, partner.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.580
I'm gonna start cutting you off
at the ankles.

07:37.124 --> 07:41.295
Then I'm gonna take your feet
and throw them right in the basket.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.796
Cute, huh?

07:43.547 --> 07:45.007
Shut up, Nico.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.885
Look, I can make you disappear.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.308
Grab his leg.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.728
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- Nico!

08:01.857 --> 08:05.360
You think you're soldiers?
You're fucking barbarians!

08:07.988 --> 08:09.198
Get out!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.663
Get back to the LZ.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.917
If I don't cap him now,
he's gonna do me later.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.419
I'll call a chopper in for us. I'll cover this.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.671
Just get the hell out of here!

08:24.755 --> 08:25.589
Come on, move!

08:25.672 --> 08:27.508
Bring him back here!

08:29.885 --> 08:33.054
Nobody move! Everybody stay
on that damn porch!

08:35.557 --> 08:36.892
Go, Nico!

08:40.062 --> 08:42.648
Nelson, I'm through. I'm finished!

08:54.535 --> 08:57.538
Nicola, Sara,
what name do you give your child?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.248
Giuliano Nicola.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.876
Giuliano...

09:03.126 --> 09:05.629
...you have become a new creation.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.465
With the help of your family and friends...

09:08.549 --> 09:11.510
...we bring your Christian dignity
unstained...

09:11.593 --> 09:14.388
...into the everlasting life of heaven.

09:14.596 --> 09:18.684
- Come on. You always make me late.
- I'm the boss. You have to drive me!

09:19.226 --> 09:22.062
I'll trace the sign of the Cross
upon your forehead...

09:22.145 --> 09:25.232
...and I invite your parents to do the same.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.904
In the name of the Father, the Son...

09:31.113 --> 09:33.448
...and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.411
Look at him. He's such a good baby.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.961
That's beautiful.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.521
- I know you're the boss but...
- That's right. Remember that.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.689
Hi, guys.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.316
Hey, how are you?

10:07.608 --> 10:09.526
You guys look so good!

10:09.610 --> 10:12.946
We haven't done anything.
We're clean. Some of us, anyway.

10:13.030 --> 10:16.700
Well, Lieutenant, eight more days
and you're gonna miss me.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.035
Parts of you, anyway.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.494
You see this cop?

10:19.578 --> 10:23.040
This one. This one here.
She could bust me anytime.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.042
Look at that! Look at that!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.252
- This is the partner?
- This is the partner.

10:27.336 --> 10:30.047
I got dressed up because
you told me you were wearing a tux.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.966
You look fabulous.
She goes to work looking like this?

10:33.050 --> 10:35.969
This girl, sometimes she comes
in just lingerie.

10:36.220 --> 10:40.641
Don't tell our secrets. She's never gonna
let you out with me again.

10:43.268 --> 10:47.064
I told you guys to have a good time,
but take it easy, will you?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.358
Toscani holds the record
for having more relatives...

10:49.441 --> 10:52.653
...under federal indictment
than any other cop in the city.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.863
Look at those stiff dicks.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.158
A free meal and they come out like flies.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.536
Hey, you greaseball bastards!

11:00.744 --> 11:03.080
Didn't we buy that monkey once?

11:06.875 --> 11:09.419
Rosa, I'm so worried. So worried.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.303
- What's wrong?
- Nico!

11:19.012 --> 11:21.598
Isn't today a day you should be happy?

11:21.682 --> 11:24.810
- What's wrong?
- It's Lucia. She's gone again.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.855
- Is it that boy?
"- Sí", Nico.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.279
I have to go to work right now.
You gonna be at the bakery later?

11:35.362 --> 11:35.904
{y:i}Sí.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.950
I'll come by the bakery and we'll talk.
Maybe I can do something.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.244
Thank you, Nico. Thank you.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.375
{y:i}Lester, this is Unit 10, Tango-X-ray.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.295
We're up and clear. You got that?

11:51.378 --> 11:55.549
{y:i}Delores, Toscani told me he'll watch
{y:i}over you and take care of you real good...

11:55.632 --> 11:57.092
{y:i}... your last week on the street.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.970
{y:i}Never had a friend who was a DA before.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.144
I'm gonna take a piss and be right back.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.687
- Here?
- Yeah.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.781
She's fine, ain't she?

12:22.701 --> 12:25.162
Excuse me, I just had to stop and tell you...

12:25.245 --> 12:28.999
...you look like the sun setting
on a waterfall in the springtime.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.085
And you got five seconds, and three are up.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.421
You ain't got to be...

12:36.298 --> 12:39.051
Lady cops need boyfriends, too, you dig?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.929
But you have a nice day, just the same.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.353
Nothing but trouble coming
in my place tonight.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.104
I know this one.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.985
You seen this girl?

12:57.152 --> 12:58.862
I ain't seen shit.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.448
You haven't seen this girl?

13:02.908 --> 13:05.077
Hey, Schifo, how you doing?

13:06.828 --> 13:09.915
- You seen this girl?
- You know I quit messing with that stuff.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.960
- I ain't into this shit anymore.
- What are you into?

13:13.043 --> 13:15.295
Why don't the fuck
you assholes leave me alone?

13:15.379 --> 13:17.756
- I paid your boy off Monday night.
- My boys, huh?

13:17.840 --> 13:22.177
Now take some of that fucking money
and buy your mama a condominium.

13:22.761 --> 13:26.306
I thought this was a kosher bar, man.
No pork allowed.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.107
Say, man, you seen this girl?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.986
I seen the top of her head.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.116
That's good.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.551
Stop this motherfucker.
He's crazy. Where's my piece?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.639
He ain't nothing. Take him out.
He's motherfucking crazy.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.975
He's a fucking Italian puke!

14:11.727 --> 14:13.603
Freeze, motherfucker!

14:15.772 --> 14:18.692
Come on, man. Please. Put the gun away.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.206
All right. Who else wants some?

14:33.290 --> 14:35.208
You're destroying the image of my place.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.420
You'll never be the fucking man.
You'll never be the man.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.047
Get over here!

14:40.297 --> 14:42.716
Hold it, man. Don't do me ugly.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.720
Listen. I know where the chick is.
She's upstairs.

14:47.095 --> 14:50.223
- Yeah? She's upstairs?
- 2-C. I swear, man. It's 2-C.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.233
This isn't what it looks like.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.110
Listen, he's my cousin. He's a cop.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.237
I didn't know they had all of this.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.822
Get out of here.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.368
You having a good time?

15:09.451 --> 15:10.952
Pretty good time.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.792
What is this shit? You wanna get high?

15:17.542 --> 15:19.127
You wanna get high?

15:35.435 --> 15:38.062
You're acting stupid, man! Stop it!

15:40.773 --> 15:43.568
Stop. You playing the cop, I'm tired of it.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.905
I'll show you what time is
'cause you'll do tall time.

15:46.988 --> 15:50.825
Just take it, it's yours.
Three grand. It's in the mattress.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.328
You want to fucking bribe me, man?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.997
Put your clothes on. We're going home.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.373
Stop it.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.293
I'm tired of you. You shut up!

16:01.127 --> 16:04.047
Don't you understand that there are people
out there who love you.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.841
Right. Keep talking. Keep flapping.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.427
In my business!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.556
Is this your school stuff?

16:13.640 --> 16:17.769
It's my math homework and my history.
You gonna write me another note, Nico?

16:17.852 --> 16:19.520
Come on. We're going home.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.856
No, you go home. I'm tired.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.610
I'll give you something, something big.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.527
Oh, yeah?

16:26.611 --> 16:30.573
This is huge, my man.
It's a shipment coming in next Tuesday.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.576
What the hell do you know
about a shipment?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.120
This is square, on my mother's soul.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.374
You gotta believe me, man.
You can't set me up.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.962
I heard it from a hooker friend who's
banging this big coke lawyer. He told her.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.588
- What lawyer?
- I don't know.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.173
What do you mean you don't know?

16:47.257 --> 16:49.676
Carlos Abandano. That's the one.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.638
Better fucking pray to God
you ain't bullshitting me...

16:53.721 --> 16:56.891
...or I'll come back and tear your heart out.
Let's go.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.522
Who are you?

17:02.605 --> 17:03.606
Get back!

17:03.690 --> 17:05.275
I own this place!

17:06.401 --> 17:08.069
I own this joint.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.573
There's a guy upstairs.
I want to get him arrested!

17:13.866 --> 17:17.287
- That's the motherfucker right there!
- These two guys are under arrest.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.872
It's a cesspool in there. Check it out.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.294
Boy, you got some strange toilet habits.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.588
I'm gonna take her home and clean her up.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.799
I don't want to take her
to her grandmother like this.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.750
Jax, I hate these cocaine lawyers.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.920
And this shitty weather.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.091
They're gonna have me serving time.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.929
I wish you'd relax, hon.
This'll never get into court.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.722
Except against us.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.684
I don't care how
I have to get at these guys...

18:21.768 --> 18:22.685
Let me reiterate.

18:22.769 --> 18:27.106
You said you were going to protect
my butt and be my guardian angel.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.691
Hang on, hang on.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.695
There is an engine block
clearing customs...

18:33.363 --> 18:35.448
...Tuesday, 10:00 pickup.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.244
Fulton Meat Market.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.789
An engine block?

18:49.295 --> 18:50.880
Clever, clever, guys.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.268
I'd like an '86 Lincoln...

19:03.851 --> 19:06.229
...IIlinois 354-DOG-6"7", please.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.821
{y:i}Ramone Chi Chi Testamente,
{y:i}a Salvadoran national with quite a record.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.407
Remember, you were harping on me
about having a date.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.992
Dream on, baby.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.496
I want to tell you, what I turned down
tonight, you could never come close to.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.333
You should become a science-fiction
writer, instead of a cop or a DA...

19:27.417 --> 19:29.168
...with that imagination you got.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.753
You're right.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.762
How you doing, Mr. Abandano?

19:41.764 --> 19:43.433
Chi Chi, how you doing?

19:51.107 --> 19:53.860
- I do not like this place.
- You do not like this place?

19:53.943 --> 19:57.947
No, I don't want to go into this place.
You know I hate places like this.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.658
- What don't you like about it?
- The element!

20:01.951 --> 20:03.870
You know something, darling?

20:04.037 --> 20:07.540
I really think that you should lighten up,
because...

20:08.917 --> 20:10.501
...we're gonna party.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.801
This is my lawyer. Say hello.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.351
- Two for dinner?
- Just drinks.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.697
Good work.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.158
I don't believe it.

20:43.826 --> 20:47.121
Sit down here. You're gonna love
this place. I promise.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.877
Salvano, the fucking cockroach.

20:54.087 --> 20:58.007
I don't believe this. You always do this
to me in front of people.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.432
That is beautiful.

21:08.851 --> 21:09.978
Excuse me.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.187
I love it.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.190
You'll have your engine block
on Tuesday, Boss.

21:15.108 --> 21:19.028
If this happened a week from Tuesday,
I could read about it in the paper.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.447
Relax. It'll make you famous.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.284
Just what I need, to be famous.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.798
Can you believe this?

21:40.675 --> 21:44.429
{y:i}Lieutenant Strozah, meet those two cops
{y:i}in the back alley.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.229
We got it down pretty good.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.815
We got guys in the front,
we got a couple of cars out back.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.400
Sealed off pretty good.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.485
Three of our best guys.
I handpicked each one.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.988
Jackson, Lukich, Nico. They're all topshelf.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.407
They know how to do this.
They've done it before.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.826
I can tell how much you love it here.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.996
God! Now I know why I'm a vegetarian.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.415
You eat meat. I know you eat meat.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.209
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I've heard you eat meat.

22:17.587 --> 22:20.882
Nico, keep the channel clear.
Don't embarrass us.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.510
Right over there.
Two guys in the alley over there.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.596
Definitely the Feds.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.976
{y:i}Frank, it's fucking infested down here.
{y:i}What are you trying to do to us?

22:32.060 --> 22:34.103
Someone from downtown got wind of it.
Don't worry.

22:34.187 --> 22:37.273
They're trying to make points.
Just handle the pinch.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.943
This ain't a bust, it's a fucking convention.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.694
I don't believe this.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.532
Look at this, boys. Here we go.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.082
Here we go. Jackson, stay back.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.548
I think they made you.
You're too pretty to be a meatpacker.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.801
It's going down, boys. Let's go.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.471
Keep your heads up.

23:08.972 --> 23:10.473
Woman, let's do it.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.356
The cars are going around the corner.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.075
Come on, Nico. Lukich, get up there.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.172
What do you think?

23:43.548 --> 23:44.757
Looks good.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.177
Let's get on with it.

24:01.316 --> 24:04.277
- What the fuck are you assholes doing?
- Feds!

24:04.360 --> 24:06.613
Shit! They jumped too soon!

24:10.033 --> 24:11.159
What the fuck is this?

24:11.242 --> 24:12.619
Freeze! Police!

24:24.797 --> 24:26.132
Get back!

24:51.074 --> 24:52.742
Nico, the Lincoln!

25:02.085 --> 25:03.169
Nico!

25:15.431 --> 25:16.474
Chi Chi!

25:20.478 --> 25:21.396
Nico!

25:22.480 --> 25:23.606
Nico!

25:26.234 --> 25:27.694
Fucking animal!

25:28.695 --> 25:30.280
Get rid of him!

25:32.448 --> 25:34.117
I'm out! Do him!

25:41.291 --> 25:44.168
He's still on the roof! Get rid of him!

25:48.715 --> 25:50.466
Where do I go? What do I do?

25:50.550 --> 25:52.635
Hit those hooks over there!

26:15.366 --> 26:16.868
What do I do?

26:17.660 --> 26:19.537
Stop the fucking car!

26:21.581 --> 26:23.458
Stop the fucking car!

26:37.931 --> 26:39.974
Hands up! Out of the car!

26:45.104 --> 26:48.775
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You scared me to death!

26:49.025 --> 26:50.610
Nico, you okay?

26:52.153 --> 26:54.280
- Wait till you hear about...
- Shut the fuck up!

26:54.364 --> 26:56.449
You make a nice hood ornament, Sarge.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.952
- Come on!
- Gotta get this garbage out of here.

26:59.035 --> 27:02.538
You gonna lose your license
driving around like that.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.210
Let's go.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.426
What do we got here?

27:18.471 --> 27:20.556
What kind of high is this?

27:22.517 --> 27:23.851
Sky-high.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.479
Military explosives.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.026
C-4, my man.

27:40.702 --> 27:41.995
Hey, Boss...

27:42.078 --> 27:45.331
...you can see your place
from the office of the FBI.

27:45.415 --> 27:47.083
Ain't that something?

27:47.166 --> 27:50.169
{y:i}- Your name again?
- Agent Neeley, Chicago office.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.925
{y:i}The arresting officer, Toscani.
{y:i}What does he do?

27:56.009 --> 27:59.429
- He's a tac sergeant, CPD Vice.
{y:i}- Hold on a minute...

27:59.762 --> 28:01.139
I'll tell you what this cop is.

28:01.222 --> 28:04.350
He's a fucking menace.
He almost strangled me!

28:04.684 --> 28:07.520
Your problem is being
taken care of right now.

28:07.604 --> 28:11.566
It should've been handled 12 hours ago
when my throat was in one piece!

28:11.649 --> 28:14.319
I don't know who's running
this outfit here...

28:14.402 --> 28:18.740
...but I'll tell you one thing:
Somebody better get his wires straight.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.368
You don't know who you're dealing with.

28:22.452 --> 28:25.914
This maniac should be wearing a number,
not a badge!

28:26.623 --> 28:29.626
{y:i}- The director does not want a problem.
- There won't be one.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.669
{y:i}And I don't want any problems.

28:31.753 --> 28:32.587
I understand.

28:32.670 --> 28:35.965
{y:i}Just listen.
{y:i}They are to be released immediately.

28:36.132 --> 28:37.759
You can count on it.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.385
{y:i}Avoid all contacts.

28:39.469 --> 28:42.430
You'll have the Bureau's full cooperation.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.480
You're free to go.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.442
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

29:08.831 --> 29:13.419
Good work. I loved the face of that
FBI guy when the call came through.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.047
Salvano.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.513
I don't want any more problems.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.224
I don't enjoy babysitting.

29:29.519 --> 29:32.522
Everything is going to be all right
from now on.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.691
I promise you, Mr. Zagon.

29:42.782 --> 29:46.369
Attention, please. Attention, everyone.
Please, guys.

29:46.911 --> 29:49.372
I just want to get a few things
straightened out.

29:49.455 --> 29:54.168
A few minutes ago, I received a call from
the First Deputy Superintendent's office.

29:54.252 --> 29:58.631
As we all know, possession of these kinds
of explosives is a federal offense...

29:58.715 --> 30:02.468
...and falls under the jurisdiction
of the federal agencies represented here.

30:02.552 --> 30:04.887
What kind of bullshit is that?

30:04.971 --> 30:08.308
The Feds come in, the doors close,
nobody hears, smells or sees anything.

30:08.391 --> 30:09.601
And that's no answer.

30:09.684 --> 30:12.186
It's no answer to why
the biggest drug dealer in the city...

30:12.270 --> 30:14.439
...is out on the street
as free as a fucking bird!

30:14.522 --> 30:18.318
Keep it in your pants, all right. These men
have a job to do, just like we do.

30:18.401 --> 30:20.862
It's their game, let them play it.

30:23.156 --> 30:26.826
What I'm about to say
does not leave this room. Is that clear?

30:27.744 --> 30:30.288
Mr. Salvano has been working
for some time...

30:30.371 --> 30:33.166
...in cooperation
with certain federal agencies.

30:33.249 --> 30:37.921
I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature
or extent of Mr. Salvano's involvement.

30:38.171 --> 30:41.591
I just learned of its existence myself
a few hours ago.

30:41.674 --> 30:44.761
One thing I can tell you
is that Mr. Salvano's role...

30:44.844 --> 30:48.765
...is crucial to an extremely sensitive,
ongoing investigation.

30:48.848 --> 30:49.891
Any surveillance...

30:49.974 --> 30:54.938
...harassment or unauthorized operations
against this individual are forbidden.

30:55.188 --> 30:59.108
I order all of you, with due respect
for your work and your courage...

30:59.192 --> 31:00.693
...to stand down.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.699
Why don't you assholes
stand down on this?

31:15.291 --> 31:16.960
You're gonna need me.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.545
Need you. For what?

31:19.879 --> 31:21.798
To get your ass out of jail.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.008
You think you can afford my bail?

31:24.259 --> 31:25.218
No.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.470
Neither do I. Not on this pay.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.723
You'll end up in jail for a long time,
I have the strangest feeling.

31:30.807 --> 31:33.434
You're jealous 'cause I'm gonna stay a cop.

31:33.726 --> 31:36.604
What the fuck is this? Go back to work.

31:42.402 --> 31:43.820
Here we go.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.305
What are you thinking?

33:13.493 --> 33:15.912
Isn't this your mother's church?

33:16.371 --> 33:19.832
Yes, but I'll bet she hasn't seen these boys
in the choir.

33:41.938 --> 33:43.314
Hey, Nico!

33:43.731 --> 33:45.441
I can't believe you're in church
without your family.

33:45.525 --> 33:46.776
Hello, Father. How are you?

33:46.859 --> 33:48.528
This must be your partner in crime.

33:48.611 --> 33:50.405
- Delores Jackson.
- I'm Father Gennaro.

33:50.488 --> 33:52.365
I saw you at the baptismal party.

33:52.448 --> 33:55.034
- Nico, we gotta go!
- No, please. Wait.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.495
God, it's good you're here.

33:57.579 --> 34:00.039
If you got a few minutes,
there's something I'd like to show you.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.374
Please.

34:02.834 --> 34:05.837
I haven't been down here since I was a kid.

34:15.972 --> 34:17.431
What's this?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.891
The rats are getting bigger.

34:21.436 --> 34:25.440
- When did this happen?
- Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.

34:25.523 --> 34:28.150
What do they want, the bingo receipts?

35:00.183 --> 35:01.726
These are friends.

35:01.809 --> 35:04.020
Father Tomasino, this is Nico.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.647
{y:i}- Mucho gusto, Padre.
- How do you do?

35:05.730 --> 35:07.732
- Sister Mary.
- Hi, Nico.

35:08.191 --> 35:10.151
- Delores.
- How do you do, Father?

35:10.235 --> 35:12.487
{y:i}- Señora, mucho gusto.
- Hello.

35:13.863 --> 35:17.992
My friend, Father Tomasino,
is working with the sanctuary movement.

35:18.076 --> 35:19.369
He's visiting...

35:19.452 --> 35:23.706
...helping his people work out
some of their immigration problems.

35:25.041 --> 35:28.127
Sorry to have troubled you.
Nico, we must go.

35:29.712 --> 35:30.964
{y:i}Gracias.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.926
Nice meeting you, sir.

35:36.511 --> 35:37.637
Bye-bye.

35:52.527 --> 35:55.697
- How long have those people been here?
- Too long.

35:55.780 --> 35:58.575
At least the children go to our school.

35:59.242 --> 36:01.452
Who do you think broke into the room?

36:01.536 --> 36:04.956
Kids, maybe. Maybe worse.
It's not the first time.

36:06.249 --> 36:08.793
Would you like us to send a car
to check on you?

36:08.876 --> 36:11.838
No, please. Police frighten these people.

36:12.922 --> 36:15.925
I know what you mean.
They frighten me, too.

36:17.594 --> 36:21.055
It's too far out of your way.
I can't ask you to go to that much trouble.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.391
Look, I really don't mind coming by.

36:23.516 --> 36:25.643
Promise, okay? All right?

36:26.769 --> 36:30.273
Say, Nico, by the way,
when was your last confession?

36:31.649 --> 36:33.192
My last confession?

36:33.276 --> 36:36.362
I'm a married man.
I have no sins to confess.

36:37.697 --> 36:40.700
You're a police officer.
You got a lot of sins to confess.

36:40.783 --> 36:42.619
He's got your number!

36:43.244 --> 36:47.957
- Is that your impression of police officers?
- I want to see you in church Sunday, okay?

36:48.041 --> 36:51.002
I feel better when you're in church, okay?

36:51.252 --> 36:53.630
You don't show up, I'll call your mother!

36:53.713 --> 36:56.132
I wish you would. She loves you.

36:56.633 --> 36:59.969
Why don't you go to church?
It'll be good for you.

37:00.303 --> 37:02.138
Get your soul saved.

37:19.989 --> 37:21.532
Our leaders tell us...

37:21.616 --> 37:24.244
...and talk to us about them and us.

37:26.246 --> 37:28.623
But almighty God talks to us...

37:29.666 --> 37:31.793
...about all of mankind...

37:33.670 --> 37:35.004
...as one.

37:35.672 --> 37:37.966
Now, we have an obligation...

37:38.716 --> 37:41.219
...to find out what is the truth.

37:43.012 --> 37:45.807
We need to study. We need to question.

37:46.683 --> 37:49.644
We need to read and we need to find out...

37:49.727 --> 37:52.313
...what they are doing in our name.

37:55.358 --> 37:58.236
And we must support those brave souls...

37:59.320 --> 38:00.863
...who seek...

38:01.906 --> 38:03.324
...the truth.

38:05.368 --> 38:07.203
God bless us. Amen.

38:57.545 --> 38:58.880
Get down!

39:48.304 --> 39:50.682
There's nothing else we can do.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.688
Lord God, Heavenly Father...

39:56.813 --> 40:01.317
...receive the soul of our dear
departed friend, Father Joseph Gennaro.

40:06.447 --> 40:07.490
Come on.

40:17.166 --> 40:20.753
Get a list of everybody treated here today.
Everybody.

40:20.837 --> 40:23.089
Find those sanctuary people...

40:23.172 --> 40:26.843
...the ones we found hiding
in the bottom of the church.

40:27.176 --> 40:31.431
I want to know where they're from
and who might want to harm them.

40:32.974 --> 40:34.100
Where are you gonna be?

40:34.183 --> 40:36.978
Just stay by the radio. I'll find you.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.497
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, Nico!

40:56.956 --> 40:58.082
Oh, no!

41:09.302 --> 41:12.555
Lieutenant Strozah, these are FBI agents:
Halloran, Neeley.

41:18.061 --> 41:22.232
Sweetheart, go to the car.
I'll be right there, okay? Take Mama.

41:27.570 --> 41:30.448
Nico, you okay? How's the family doing?

41:31.908 --> 41:34.911
Excuse me. I'd like to have a word
with you.

41:35.245 --> 41:36.454
Alone.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.927
What the hell is it?

41:51.010 --> 41:53.596
It's you, that's what the fuck it is!

41:53.846 --> 41:55.348
Keep your goddamn hands off me!

41:55.431 --> 41:57.475
- You let Salvano walk.
- Salvano?

41:57.767 --> 41:58.101
Yeah.

41:58.184 --> 42:00.186
What are you, crazy?
What does he have to do with this?

42:00.270 --> 42:02.313
That was no cherry bomb, that was C-4.

42:02.397 --> 42:05.984
I've used that shit. I know what it
smells like and what it blows like.

42:06.067 --> 42:10.363
Salvano never came near that C-4.
It's in federal holding right now.

42:10.446 --> 42:13.199
Besides, why would Salvano
blow up a church?

42:13.283 --> 42:15.201
I tailed him two days ago.

42:15.285 --> 42:19.247
He and his goon were in that church
and they weren't taking communion.

42:19.330 --> 42:22.542
I saw the woman who planted the bomb
and she was with Salvano's lawyer.

42:22.625 --> 42:24.794
Now, I want some fucking answers.

42:24.919 --> 42:26.879
You tailed him after I ordered you off?

42:26.963 --> 42:29.382
I want to know where Salvano is.

42:29.966 --> 42:33.136
My orders were to release him,
not babysit him.

42:33.970 --> 42:36.222
You think you're rough stuff.

42:36.306 --> 42:40.018
Martial arts hero, chop-suey crap!
Let me tell you something.

42:40.101 --> 42:43.229
You're not bulletproof.
You're not even a good cop.

42:43.313 --> 42:45.815
You sneak around
playing your street-dick games...

42:45.899 --> 42:50.361
...and all you come up with is conjecture,
wild coincidence and bullshit!

42:50.445 --> 42:54.365
I want the name of the federal agent
who signed for those explosives.

42:54.449 --> 42:56.242
You do your job, I'll do mine.

42:56.326 --> 42:57.994
Bank on it, pal.

44:10.149 --> 44:11.568
- Gentlemen.
- Hello.

44:11.651 --> 44:13.570
Hi, how are you doing?

44:22.203 --> 44:24.414
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

44:26.666 --> 44:28.751
The wallet. Let me see it.

44:32.589 --> 44:34.674
Aide to Senator Harrison.

44:45.560 --> 44:49.397
I hope I find you, you greasy mother!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

44:49.939 --> 44:52.233
Who the fuck do you think you are?

44:59.449 --> 45:04.329
I'm in front of St. Mary's church, where
seven people were killed by a bomb...

45:44.452 --> 45:47.038
- You guys stay out of trouble.
- Okay, Nico.

45:52.835 --> 45:55.129
- I hear you're looking for Salvano.
- You heard that?

45:55.213 --> 45:56.339
I know where he's at.

45:56.422 --> 45:59.259
- Where's that?
- Right here, motherfucker!

45:59.509 --> 46:03.263
- It's a long way from Kansas, Dorothy!
- Relax, man. Relax.

46:04.806 --> 46:07.058
I won't shoot you.
These guys will beat you to death.

46:07.141 --> 46:09.394
You come to our neighborhood,
fuck with our people.

46:09.477 --> 46:12.438
Now our people are going to fuck with you.

46:38.170 --> 46:39.880
We need a doctor!

46:42.758 --> 46:44.093
Fuck him up!

46:44.176 --> 46:45.845
You motherfucker!

47:42.735 --> 47:45.446
Don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

47:46.405 --> 47:47.782
- Who sent you?
- Nobody!

47:47.865 --> 47:50.201
"Nobody?" You did this for fun?

47:53.871 --> 47:55.456
Jimmy Costanza!

47:57.166 --> 48:01.379
If I find out you're lying, I'll come back
and kill you in your own kitchen.

48:01.462 --> 48:02.672
Salvano!

48:03.256 --> 48:04.757
Bautista Salvano!

48:07.677 --> 48:10.805
- That's my buddy, man.
- Yeah, man, I know him.

48:13.933 --> 48:15.476
Sic him, Bulldog.

48:15.559 --> 48:18.813
- Why are you fuckin' with my friend?
- I'm not in the mood.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.690
Fuck your mood, man.

48:26.279 --> 48:28.197
- What's happening?
- What it be like, homey?

48:28.281 --> 48:29.907
- That was real good, man.
- Peace, brother.

48:30.408 --> 48:34.453
{y:i}The mayor has announced the city's offer
{y:i}of a $25,000 reward for information...

48:34.537 --> 48:37.707
{y:i}... leading to the arrest and conviction
{y:i}of anyone responsible...

48:37.790 --> 48:40.626
{y:i}... for today's tragic
{y:i}St. Mary's church bombing.

48:41.294 --> 48:43.212
Why were we in church?

48:44.255 --> 48:45.840
I'll tell you what.

48:47.258 --> 48:51.721
I'm willing to break the rules and
I'm willing to tell you everything I know.

48:51.804 --> 48:53.723
I just want some time.

48:56.642 --> 48:58.352
It's probably Jax.

48:59.312 --> 49:01.147
Yeah, Jax. This better be good.

49:01.230 --> 49:02.648
It's bad, Nico.

49:04.483 --> 49:06.235
Long time, Nelson.

49:07.820 --> 49:12.074
Come on, man! You know better
than to use a name on an open line.

49:14.076 --> 49:17.746
I'm gonna talk for 15 seconds,
and then I'm getting off.

49:19.081 --> 49:22.418
You're in trouble, Nico.
Serious, serious trouble.

49:23.836 --> 49:26.088
Really? That's fascinating.

49:26.630 --> 49:29.842
Take your wife and family
and get them someplace safe, now!

49:29.925 --> 49:33.554
I've been wanting to bring my family
to Switzerland. I just haven't had time.

49:33.637 --> 49:37.433
You hear me? Now!
I'm risking my ass by telling you this.

49:38.184 --> 49:41.312
Okay, don't take so long
to call me next time.

49:41.604 --> 49:43.272
Good luck, "paisá".

49:57.244 --> 50:00.581
Why is the CIA calling you
at 2:00 in the morning?

50:02.625 --> 50:05.002
Because Fox is a crazy asshole.

50:06.629 --> 50:11.091
He gets drunk, he forgets he's halfway
around the world, and he calls.

50:13.969 --> 50:17.890
He says he just wanted to know
if we got his Christmas card.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.935
Listen, don't be that way.

50:22.144 --> 50:24.480
- I'm just so scared.
- Don't be.

50:24.980 --> 50:28.067
I'm gonna take care of everything,
all right?

50:30.611 --> 50:31.987
All right?

50:41.664 --> 50:43.415
Nico, who's there?

50:57.847 --> 51:01.517
O'Hara, what's going on, man?
Isn't it a little early for breakfast?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.269
Nico, how you doing?

51:03.602 --> 51:05.521
I'm sorry. I gotta take you downtown.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.773
The Feds want to talk. It'll work out.

51:07.857 --> 51:10.025
Here's the warrant, Toscani.

51:13.362 --> 51:15.156
You fucking piece of shit.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.366
I'll take that, thank you.

51:17.700 --> 51:21.745
Easy guys! He's my friend. Take it easy.
It's gonna work out. Let's go.

51:21.829 --> 51:24.832
It'll work out. I'm real sorry about this.

51:31.714 --> 51:34.049
It's not necessary! This is ridiculous!

51:34.133 --> 51:37.303
Let him play his pussy game.
This is his setup.

51:37.928 --> 51:41.098
Who do you think you are coming here
and treating my son like a criminal?

51:41.182 --> 51:42.600
Who do you think you are?

51:42.683 --> 51:46.061
- Just stop it! There's an infant here!
- Easy, easy.

51:48.147 --> 51:51.817
- Check that coat.
- Why don't you come check it, asshole.

51:52.651 --> 51:53.569
Take it easy!

51:53.652 --> 51:56.655
Why don't you come
and put your hands on me!

51:59.783 --> 52:01.827
- Get him out of here!
- Everything's gonna work out.

52:01.911 --> 52:04.663
Come on. I'll be back in three hours!

52:06.415 --> 52:09.543
The Police Association's
got lawyers for this!

52:11.045 --> 52:12.755
You can't do this!

52:20.429 --> 52:24.016
This guy, in the middle of the day,
comes in my place and starts wrecking it.

52:24.099 --> 52:26.185
He assaults my customers.

52:26.810 --> 52:31.440
He starts doing all this outer-space stuff,
putting my customers in orbit even.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.986
I remember those violations
you told me he was guilty of.

52:36.070 --> 52:38.405
Look, this is my boy, right here.

52:38.781 --> 52:40.282
They finally got you, huh?

52:40.366 --> 52:42.243
They finally got you, motherfucker.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.829
I told you it was gonna go down.
Should've listened...

52:44.912 --> 52:45.788
There he is.

52:45.871 --> 52:49.208
You guys got one hell
of a police department around here.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.752
I got a cousin in the department
in New Orleans.

52:51.836 --> 52:54.088
You ever heard of Bob Bouquet?

53:02.429 --> 53:04.598
Put your ass in that chair.

53:08.102 --> 53:11.105
Illegal wiretaps, unauthorized surveillance.

53:12.773 --> 53:13.774
When was this guy born?

53:13.858 --> 53:17.528
You're quite a cop, Toscani.
You don't listen to anybody, do you?

53:17.778 --> 53:20.072
- Where's Jax?
- She's out of this!

53:20.156 --> 53:22.074
You're the rotten apple in this barrel.

53:22.158 --> 53:24.994
We don't need to look any farther
than you and your family.

53:25.077 --> 53:26.912
- You, mother...
- Nico!

53:28.122 --> 53:30.291
Do you want to go to prison?

53:31.333 --> 53:32.918
Unlawful entry.

53:33.169 --> 53:35.963
- IIlegal search and seizure.
- Deputy...

53:38.841 --> 53:41.802
Who do you think is pulling their strings?

53:42.386 --> 53:44.763
Who do you think they work for?

53:45.181 --> 53:47.892
You were ordered to back off on Salvano.

53:47.975 --> 53:51.729
I suppose you had too big a hard-on
for that, didn't you?

53:52.188 --> 53:54.440
You can't be in on this, Fred.

53:56.066 --> 53:58.777
You're officially suspended, Toscani.

53:59.361 --> 54:01.739
I want your badge and your gun.

54:09.038 --> 54:10.789
You gonna hold me?

54:11.332 --> 54:13.167
You can walk for now.

54:14.293 --> 54:15.878
Don't walk far.

54:25.179 --> 54:27.014
Sara, I'm all right.

54:28.057 --> 54:30.184
It's okay, and I love you.

54:32.561 --> 54:35.147
Tell Mama not to worry. All right?

54:35.815 --> 54:37.316
I love you. 'Bye.

54:38.901 --> 54:41.237
What the hell is going on?
What's happening here?

54:41.320 --> 54:46.200
The sanctuary people, they're refugees
from El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile.

54:46.534 --> 54:49.161
They're terrified of cops.
They're not even talking to me.

54:49.245 --> 54:53.666
Down at the morgue, they got a guy
who was not a congregation member.

54:54.917 --> 54:56.418
Alan Singletary.

54:57.378 --> 55:00.840
He's an aide to Senator Harrison.
The Foreign Relations Committee Harrison.

55:00.923 --> 55:05.135
The guy who's been crawling all over
the Central American drug connections.

55:05.970 --> 55:07.513
You're gonna make a hell of a DA.

55:07.596 --> 55:11.684
Harrison's staff has been compiling
some kind of heavyweight white paper.

55:12.017 --> 55:16.146
It implicates some of the major
intelligence agencies in drug trafficking.

55:16.230 --> 55:18.190
They'll release it next week.

55:19.316 --> 55:21.610
- So that's how Fox knew.
- Who?

55:22.278 --> 55:27.199
An old Agency buddy of mine called me
last night. He said my family's in danger.

55:27.283 --> 55:29.076
Luke, I need a favor.

55:29.160 --> 55:32.538
I need you to go to the house, call
Uncle Branca. Mama's got the number.

55:32.621 --> 55:34.331
Get the family ready to move out.

55:34.415 --> 55:38.002
You got it, buddy.
They took away your "pistola", right?

55:38.335 --> 55:39.378
Yeah.

55:40.880 --> 55:41.589
Thanks.

55:41.672 --> 55:43.257
I don't believe this.

55:56.312 --> 56:00.232
You come in here, with the children,
and bring all this up...

56:02.443 --> 56:03.611
Listen.

56:03.694 --> 56:05.154
You know me.

56:05.488 --> 56:07.448
Please, tell these people...

56:07.531 --> 56:09.825
...they don't have anything to worry about.

56:09.909 --> 56:12.870
There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.

56:13.329 --> 56:14.914
I know, Sister.

56:24.173 --> 56:25.841
Father Tomasino.

56:27.927 --> 56:29.595
He came alone...

56:30.554 --> 56:33.140
...two weeks ago. He had papers...

56:34.225 --> 56:36.685
...papers to give to the senator.

56:37.686 --> 56:41.148
Father Tomasino was going
to give the mass that day.

56:42.107 --> 56:44.693
Father Gennaro talked him out of it.

56:45.069 --> 56:47.613
He was afraid for Father Tomasino.

56:48.030 --> 56:51.116
So it was Father Tomasino
they wanted to kill.

56:53.702 --> 56:54.954
Where is Father Tomasino?

56:55.037 --> 56:57.289
He go, mister. He ran away.

56:58.040 --> 57:02.044
If anybody knows where he is, you've got
to tell me because I know I can help him.

57:02.127 --> 57:04.046
We don't know, mister.

57:17.476 --> 57:19.979
Jax, I'm serious. You're out of this.

57:20.062 --> 57:23.732
Wait a minute. I got a list.
You told me to get a list.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.987
I'm telling you, you're finished.
I mean it. Out.

57:28.070 --> 57:30.656
You're not talking to a rookie,
you understand?

57:30.739 --> 57:35.035
You go home, you take care of your family,
okay, and I'll call you.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.540
Paperwork only!

57:39.665 --> 57:42.042
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

57:45.171 --> 57:46.505
Thank you!

58:02.354 --> 58:05.483
Okay, come across now.
Come on, baby, come on.

58:08.402 --> 58:09.737
Hi, Nico!

58:34.053 --> 58:36.180
- Call the police.
- Come on!

58:40.559 --> 58:42.394
Freeze, motherfucker!

58:42.561 --> 58:44.563
Anybody moves, he dies.

58:45.064 --> 58:47.817
Drop that magazine, motherfucker, now!

58:49.235 --> 58:52.488
Everybody's gonna ditch their weapons,
butt first.

58:52.571 --> 58:55.574
Grab the barrel and do it, everybody. You!

58:56.325 --> 58:57.493
Now, you.

58:58.118 --> 58:59.245
Now, you.

59:01.163 --> 59:02.998
Put your hands on your head.

59:03.082 --> 59:05.584
All right, fall in behind the last man.

59:05.668 --> 59:08.629
I don't think you can drop us all, badass.

59:09.213 --> 59:11.423
You're right, but I'll get an A for effort.

59:11.507 --> 59:13.425
All right. Let's go. Fall out!

59:13.509 --> 59:15.511
Put your hands on your head.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.429
Come on, you! Move!

59:24.144 --> 59:27.148
Please don't come in here. Please, please.

59:27.606 --> 59:29.275
Not in my store.

59:29.525 --> 59:32.111
It's a police emergency. I'm a cop.

59:32.194 --> 59:35.197
On your knees. Give me the phone.
Let's go.

59:36.365 --> 59:39.201
- This guy's gotta work, too.
- Get down, asshole.

59:39.285 --> 59:40.870
Get the fuck down!

59:41.120 --> 59:42.288
You wanna get down?

59:42.371 --> 59:44.748
Get down on your fucking knees!

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.771
They tell me, "Come to America!"

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.235
No, not in my store!

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.699
There's the police!

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.164
No, mister!

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.770
Another police car.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.443
Look! My store.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.950
Come on, come on. Is it clear?

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:06.413
Sara, Branca will take care of us.
We'll be safe there.

01:01:07.206 --> 01:01:10.375
Family goes in the Lincoln.
I'll ride in front.

01:01:20.469 --> 01:01:24.139
I'll be five minutes behind you.
It's got to be this way.

01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:27.726
Let's go.

01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:30.604
Where's Jax?

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:34.024
She thinks there's some documents
in some guy's apartment.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.986
They killed the wrong priest.

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:41.156
What are you talking about?

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:48.247
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.209
The second priest from Costa Rica...

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:57.214
...hiding in the church.
He was the one they meant to kill.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.800
You know where to find this guy?

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.301
No, I do not.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.429
Then you're gonna need help.

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:06.849
Yeah, I'd like you to help me.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.684
Watch my family.

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:11.186
What are you gonna do?

01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:13.605
You don't want to know.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:29.371
Freeze! Put your hands up in the air.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:32.291
Now go put them on the hood of the car.

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:37.588
Special Agent Neeley, what were you doing
with that woman up there?

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.593
Were you engaging in some kind
of unnatural sex acts with that young lady?

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:44.887
She must be 15!

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.639
That's illegal in some states, you know.

01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:49.057
What are you talking about?

01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:52.603
I thought you federal agents were straight,
honorable guys.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.022
Does your wife know about this?

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.233
Sex is not the only thing in life.

01:02:58.317 --> 01:02:59.568
Get in.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:11.330
- So, how has your day been?
- Okay.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:17.252
Listen, Toscani, I want to congratulate you.

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:19.796
You just made number four
on the "most-wanted" list.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.633
Number four? I want to be number one.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:26.261
The day is young.

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:30.766
What can I do for you?

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:35.187
There was a quantity of C-4 explosive
brought in here four days ago.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.105
Hell, that's gone.

01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:38.607
- When?
- Right away.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.652
They scooped that stuff out of here
before it even got tagged.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.403
You know who took it?

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:44.488
CIA.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.952
Let me see the paperwork on it.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.703
You got to sign.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:56.333
Yeah, I remember that fellow.
Flew special out of Langley. Bomb tech.

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:58.502
Real nice fellow.

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:00.712
- I'll bet.
- Here it is.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:02.214
{y:i}Fox.

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:04.049
{y:i}Nelson Fox.

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:10.222
- Thanks.
- Right.

01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:13.141
Now what?

01:04:14.393 --> 01:04:18.981
{y:i}Yes, sir. The agent has been with
{y:i}the Central American desk since 1984.

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:22.067
Thank you. That's what I wanted to know.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.528
All right, take your shoes off.

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:27.072
Come on, let's go.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.785
So you think I'm a bad cop, Neeley?

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:34.830
You know something? Maybe I am.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:37.708
But at least I don't have my face
buried up Washington's ass.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.627
Listen, Toscani.
Maybe I've judged you a little harshly.

01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:42.588
I think you have.
And you know something?

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:45.924
What I'd like to do,
for the way you've treated me...

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:48.927
...is treat you in a similar fashion.
I'd like you to get up...

01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:51.722
...run your ass over there
and jump in the fucking lake.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.391
If you don't hurry,
I'll empty this gun in your butt.

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.393
Move it, Agent Neeley!

01:04:59.021 --> 01:05:00.355
Let's go!

01:05:09.865 --> 01:05:11.366
Jump, Neeley!

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.983
Nico, what are you doing here?

01:05:45.067 --> 01:05:46.985
- I need a favor.
- Sure.

01:05:48.737 --> 01:05:51.824
- How late are you gonna be here today?
- I'm off at 6:00.

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:53.283
I'll be here.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:02.751
Don't be too long, lady.
I got a crew coming in.

01:06:02.835 --> 01:06:05.003
Thanks. We'll be done in a little while.

01:06:05.087 --> 01:06:06.755
We don't have much time.

01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:10.259
They're going to tear this goddamn place
down in a matter of hours.

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:13.053
There's no way to access
Covert Operations directly...

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:17.182
...but I got a guy at Princeton.
He has a database bigger than Langley.

01:06:18.934 --> 01:06:21.353
How the hell did you get in this mess?

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:24.356
I thought you were finished with the CIA.

01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:29.319
Trap door.

01:06:39.788 --> 01:06:42.040
We'll wriggle up these two...

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:44.501
...operative dossiers.

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:48.714
Start with my friend, Nelson.

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:04.730
Your friend has had a hell of a career.

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:08.442
Give me the names of every Agency man
involved in this.

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:16.408
Nico, what is going on here?

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:19.995
Here we go.

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:25.250
Five agents from the Central American
desk. All of them, trained assassins.

01:07:25.334 --> 01:07:29.755
They've all come to Chicago
in the last week and they're all still here.

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:33.842
They got the whole fucking
killing team here.

01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:35.594
It looks that way.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:41.308
Thanks.

01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:45.187
I owe you one.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.357
- Where are you going?
- I gotta find that priest.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.858
Be careful.

01:07:53.946 --> 01:07:55.948
{y:i}I find this totally incredulous.

01:07:56.031 --> 01:08:00.452
{y:i}You, being a station chief at the CIA,
{y:i}didn't know what was going on?

01:08:00.536 --> 01:08:02.788
{y:i}Mr. Senator,
{y:i}I'd like to explain a few things.

01:08:02.871 --> 01:08:07.000
{y:i}Either you perjured yourself earlier,
{y:i}or you're lying to us now.

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:10.546
{y:i}Take a few moments
{y:i}before you answer this.

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:12.965
{y:i}And remember that you're under oath.

01:08:13.048 --> 01:08:17.803
{y:i}It was agreed this was a valuable asset
{y:i}and that I had to work out a way...

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:20.471
{y:i}... they had to work out a way
{y:i}in which to take over.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:23.308
{y:i}And did that include
{y:i}giving money to the enterprise?

01:08:23.392 --> 01:08:25.227
{y:i}Not insofar as I knew.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.813
{y:i}- And the colonel never told you?
{y:i}- No.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.066
{y:i}Are you saying that this was going
{y:i}to be a donation for the CIA...

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.609
{y:i}... as far as you were concerned?

01:08:32.693 --> 01:08:34.153
{y:i}We were going to walk away from it.

01:08:34.236 --> 01:08:35.444
Hello.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.490
Oh, yes, Sister. Yes.

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:40.367
Sister Mary, right.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.788
No, there will be no problem.
Now just calm down. Right, right.

01:08:46.081 --> 01:08:47.666
Now where are you?

01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:01.430
Who is it?

01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:33.127
Father!

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:35.046
Get her out of here.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.968
This way, Father.

01:10:33.689 --> 01:10:35.607
Where did you find this guy?

01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:39.611
The nun from the daycare called.
She's with the priest at a place on Damon.

01:10:39.695 --> 01:10:42.948
She saw two guys sneaking
around the church and she got scared.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.950
I got papers from that senator's aide.

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:49.621
Everything Harrison has been working on.
It's unbelievable. It's over at my place.

01:10:49.705 --> 01:10:54.001
I need you to do me a favor.
Stay out of it. Just stay in the car.

01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:58.255
Nico, far be it for me to complain...

01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:02.968
...but you got Jax pulling burglaries.
You got me doing God only knows what.

01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:06.471
When we hit the joint,
I don't want you celling with me.

01:11:06.555 --> 01:11:08.891
Jax, we'll work out something.

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:26.617
Why don't you go over there
and sweet-talk him?

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.743
Sure.

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:41.048
If I were you, I would listen
to what this man has to say.

01:11:42.174 --> 01:11:44.426
He knows what's best for you.

01:11:57.105 --> 01:12:00.025
You wouldn't lie to me would you, Father?

01:12:00.651 --> 01:12:02.069
It's a sin.

01:12:03.195 --> 01:12:04.530
Look at me!

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:08.742
If you spoke to anyone
about our plans to kill the senator...

01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:11.203
...tell me now...

01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:14.748
...and I won't have to use this.

01:12:14.832 --> 01:12:17.709
This is from confession. I tell no one.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:36.311
Let's go.

01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:43.569
Under no circumstances
are you to come out of this car.

01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.737
Just stay here, all right?

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.162
Take a nice look at it.

01:12:53.245 --> 01:12:55.164
I got it just for you.

01:13:01.253 --> 01:13:03.172
Do you feel that? Nice?

01:13:04.339 --> 01:13:05.883
You like that?

01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:12.639
Now you're gonna start feeling
something warm.

01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:14.975
Very warm and wonderful.

01:13:15.517 --> 01:13:16.935
Think about it.

01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:18.979
Warm. I love it!

01:13:20.856 --> 01:13:24.109
I enjoy this. I really enjoy the shit out
of this thing.

01:13:24.193 --> 01:13:25.986
We'll enjoy it together.

01:13:26.278 --> 01:13:29.907
You've always been alone.
Now you'll be with me, together!

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:50.052
I want to know who you told.

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:52.930
I told them...

01:13:54.848 --> 01:13:56.391
...you make...

01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:58.560
...the children see you...

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:01.313
...mutilating their mothers...

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:04.191
...and sometimes...

01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:06.819
...you do these things...

01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:09.029
...to the children.

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:12.199
{y:i}Did you tell anybody?

01:14:15.327 --> 01:14:17.204
{y:i}Damn it, tell me now!

01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:19.331
{y:i}Tell me now!

01:14:25.671 --> 01:14:28.215
{y:i}Father, I have had enough of this.{106486}{106555}Father, I want you to tell me the truth.

01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:36.265
Can we kill him?

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:40.686
If you told anyone about our plans
to kill the senator...

01:14:41.269 --> 01:14:43.188
...we cannot kill him!

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:46.232
Nothing!

01:14:53.073 --> 01:14:54.366
Phase two.

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:02.040
Christ!

01:15:24.104 --> 01:15:27.357
- Move it!
- What are you doing? Get out of here.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:32.946
Jax, get the hell out of here!

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:42.037
Nico!

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:50.379
Jax!

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.055
- Go!
- I got him!

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:21.910
Where is he?

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:24.872
Down there!

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:33.922
I got a bona fide emergency here.
What am I supposed to do?

01:16:39.219 --> 01:16:40.554
- Shut the fuck up!
- Yes, sir.

01:16:40.637 --> 01:16:42.473
Get inside! Come on!

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.769
I hear sirens but I don't see any cops.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:49.897
If they were cops,
they'd show me their badges, asshole.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.274
A bona fide gunfight, asshole!

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.320
Get up front!

01:16:56.862 --> 01:17:00.407
- Shut up! Be quiet!
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:04.370
Get the car on Track 3 out of the way.
At least, get that out of the way.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:08.499
They got guns all over the place.
I got a carload of passengers.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:20.195
Damn it! Call Nico's uncle
and find out if he's heard from him.

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:22.990
Shut up and save your strength.

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:24.908
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.161
- Where are we going?
- Cubicle D.

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:28.954
I got on my vest.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:33.459
Where is he?

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:35.627
What do you mean you don't know?

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.464
We don't know what happened
to him, Branca.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.174
Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.843
You hear anything, you let me know.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.262
{y:i}Capisci?

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:49.641
It's Nico.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.480
Jesus Christ.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.907
The motherfuckers got Jax.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.992
Lukich called. She's not dead.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.787
She's gonna make it.
She was wearing a vest.

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:28.681
This was picked up with your mail
this morning.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.600
They're letting you know
if you don't back off...

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:33.686
...they're gonna get to your family.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.355
- You've got to do it, Nico.
- Tell him, Sara.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.273
You know you have to.

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:40.359
Listen to her, Nicola.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.027
This is your family.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:47.074
Ever notice how clean babies smell, like
nothing in the world has touched them?

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:00.170
Mom, take him upstairs, will you?

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:06.218
Come, Giuliano, we'll go upstairs.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.560
Do you know why I love you?

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.063
What it is about you
that I've always loved?

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:19.606
It's pride.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:24.278
But, Nico, that pride may kill all of us.

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:32.494
Swallow your pride.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:37.624
Choke on it, if you have to.

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:41.503
- Lay it down, please.
- You know something?

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:46.300
There's nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for my family.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:48.552
Nobody will harm us.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.181
I don't want you to worry. Okay?

01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:33.263
Not even you can hit him
at this range, Nico.

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:36.642
That wasn't the plan, Nelson.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.185
Close range?

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:42.648
It'd never work. It's rigged.
Scanned every 35 seconds.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.651
I was thinking of a claymore on the roof...

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.069
No!

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.698
The roof is wired, too.
Sensors every 15 feet.

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:53.158
Okay. Now you can move.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:56.578
- It's me. You don't have to treat me like...
- Slow!

01:21:56.662 --> 01:22:00.165
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.
Move! Slow.

01:22:00.374 --> 01:22:03.836
You even look at me funny,
you're in the river, Toscani.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:07.214
I figured you'd do your recon
from this building.

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:12.636
- You're looking fit.
- I'm getting a bit of a tire.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.597
- Is that your own tailor?
- Hong Kong.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.517
- You've come a long way.
- Yeah.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:20.561
Just walk.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.605
I don't believe you.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:27.776
What's so hard to believe?
I want to help you, you dumb guinea.

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.863
I've been trying to talk
some sense into you.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.906
You're still "Fox the Fixer."

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:37.077
If I wanted to cap you,
I'd save myself all this damn chitchat.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:40.789
I'd make big points for myself
if I brought your scalp in.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.042
Shit, I'd be White House material.

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:45.419
Is that what Zagon is,
one of your basement boys?

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:49.381
Zagon's a rancher. 4,000 acres
in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:54.178
Beautiful place, huh? Was that bought
with opium money from the triangle?

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.264
And a ton of coke a week
from other places.

01:22:57.348 --> 01:23:00.934
Which he funnels here through Salvano.
The company getting it's cut, of course.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:02.519
Legal tender.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:06.899
So war is still the greatest business, huh?

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:11.737
These guys have started and financed
every war we've ever fought.

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:15.991
Nobody would believe me if I told them
the bankers were the CIA.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.536
Come on, Toscani, don't preach to me.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:22.206
So the senator couldn't be bought,
could he?

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:27.002
He was gonna expose your plans to invade
Nicaragua with your fucking coke money.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:29.713
So the Agency clears Zagon
to cap his ass, right?

01:23:29.797 --> 01:23:31.757
Just keep walking, asshole.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.802
So some poor, innocent priest finds out.
He comes here.

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:38.389
But you can't kill the senator
until you know if the "padre" has talked.

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:43.268
So Zagon comes in, "Tell me," with his
little doctor bag. Only by then, I'm in on it.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:47.314
And you fucking know
I'm gonna recognize his handiwork.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:51.193
If your name would've been Joe Smith,
I never would've caught it.

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:54.071
But how many Nicola Toscanis are there?

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:58.617
Tell me something, old buddy.
Do we kill our own senators now?

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:01.203
Why not? The Romans did.

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:04.206
- Are we the fucking Romans?
- We're an empire, too.

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:06.959
You don't believe that shit for a minute.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.627
Just walk. Go!

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:20.931
Hold it, Nico.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:26.562
- Here's your key, sir.
- My buddy will drive.

01:24:33.319 --> 01:24:35.029
You know something?

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:39.825
In Europe, they're trying some 80-year-old
camp guard for Nazi war crimes.

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:43.620
All around our country,
they got guys on Death Row...

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:46.457
...for murdering one, two, three guys.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:49.752
And they probably deserve
what they're gonna get.

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:51.503
But you and I...

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:54.006
...we know people
that are personally responsible...

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.426
...for the death
of 50,000 non-military personnel.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.847
Librarians, teachers, doctors,
women, children, all dead.

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:05.225
We've wiped out entire cultures.

01:25:05.476 --> 01:25:06.935
And for what?

01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:12.066
Not one CIA agent has ever been tried,
much less accused, of any crimes.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:17.446
You guys think you're above the law,
but you ain't above mine.

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:23.285
Nico, we don't have time for this.
Get in the goddamn car.

01:25:46.392 --> 01:25:50.646
I've been waiting for the day
I'd catch up with this motherfucker.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.571
Salvano and his scumbag dealer.

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:02.992
What a team we got here.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.452
I told you, you'd never be the man.

01:26:05.536 --> 01:26:08.122
Nelson, we've been looking for you.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.041
I see that you...

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.419
...found our friend.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:14.962
Thanks, Fox.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:17.715
I didn't bring him. I swear it.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:20.926
You two must have had a lot to talk about.

01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:23.512
Reminiscing about the good old days?

01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:24.847
Stay still!

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:28.225
Just fucking don't move.

01:26:28.559 --> 01:26:30.811
Nelson, bring our friend in.

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:37.693
Come on, be a good boy.

01:26:39.028 --> 01:26:40.446
Dive, Nico!

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.839
Get that motherfucker!

01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:16.732
Move it!

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.195
Get him!

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.310
Stop the car, you fuck!

01:27:59.525 --> 01:28:01.902
Stop the car, you piece of shit!

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:04.321
Stop it!

01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:23.716
Fox's car!

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.304
{y:i}He's on the ramp now.

01:29:10.387 --> 01:29:13.557
{y:i}He's coming out the Wabash entrance.
{y:i}Get there, Deep Throat.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.185
{y:i}Roger, Spike Leader. We read you.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:27.029
Get out of the car!

01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:28.906
I want him alive.

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:37.790
He's clean.

01:29:38.415 --> 01:29:40.000
Bring him over.

01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:42.836
Let's go!

01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:50.135
We're out of here.
Abandon the vehicles and get out of here.

01:29:50.928 --> 01:29:53.931
Tommy, hurry up! Get in.
We're out of here.

01:30:08.988 --> 01:30:12.241
{y:i}Now, our honored guest,
{y:i}Senator Ernest Harrison.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:36.432
I hope this don't take too long
'cause I'm getting hungry.

01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:46.567
This is bullshit. We've got work to do.

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:50.321
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

01:30:52.406 --> 01:30:56.660
We've got an hour before we say good-bye
to the honorable senator.

01:30:57.036 --> 01:31:00.289
You know, you've got to learn
to take time to...

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:02.750
...smell the roses.

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:06.545
How are you gonna do him?
Do him in the motorcade...

01:31:07.004 --> 01:31:09.798
...or pass him through a hotel kitchen?

01:31:18.932 --> 01:31:20.434
Put his face up.

01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:24.021
Hold it up.

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.733
Here you go, Toscani."Dr. Feelgood."

01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:46.209
I've used these little beauties many times
to extract information.

01:31:46.293 --> 01:31:48.628
For the first time in my life...

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:51.590
...I'm gonna do it just for the fun.

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:56.178
Get the fuck away from me!

01:32:34.684 --> 01:32:35.977
Let him go.

01:32:49.199 --> 01:32:51.534
Toscani, my sleeping beauty...

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.579
...you should've killed me
when you had the chance.

01:32:54.662 --> 01:32:57.165
You're too fucking dumb, asshole.

01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:03.505
Jake! Look out!

01:33:41.114 --> 01:33:42.991
Say something. Nico?

01:33:45.118 --> 01:33:46.119
Is there a doctor here?

01:33:46.202 --> 01:33:48.246
Quick! Call an ambulance!

01:33:52.041 --> 01:33:56.796
Agent Neeley, FBI. We've got a problem,
but we don't know what it is, yet.

01:34:01.426 --> 01:34:04.012
Please, Senator Harrison, this way.

01:34:04.804 --> 01:34:09.058
{y:i}We are standing in front of the home
{y:i}of Police Sergeant Nico Toscani.

01:34:09.142 --> 01:34:12.520
{y:i}Behind me, the entourage
{y:i}of Senator Harrison is arriving.

01:34:12.604 --> 01:34:16.983
{y:i}Lots of security here. We have police
{y:i}officers on the scene and federal agents.

01:34:17.066 --> 01:34:20.069
{y:i}Of course, there is concern
{y:i}of a possible assassination attempt.

01:34:20.153 --> 01:34:24.073
{y:i}That's why you've got
{y:i}so many law enforcement officers here.

01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:31.539
- This is Senator Harrison. Nico Toscani.
- How do you do?

01:34:31.623 --> 01:34:33.458
Please, don't get up.

01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:35.668
Detective Toscani...

01:34:35.877 --> 01:34:39.756
...I just felt compelled to come
and thank you personally...

01:34:39.839 --> 01:34:43.259
...and to assure you that we'll use
every resource available...

01:34:43.343 --> 01:34:45.219
...to bring these men to justice...

01:34:45.303 --> 01:34:49.641
...and to ensure that this type of behavior
will never be tolerated again.

01:34:51.309 --> 01:34:53.102
That would be nice.

01:34:53.519 --> 01:34:57.482
Let me introduce Roberta Alspaugh
of the Fifth Circuit Court.

01:34:57.899 --> 01:34:59.108
How do you do, ma'am?

01:34:59.192 --> 01:35:01.527
Are you sure you're well enough?

01:35:02.737 --> 01:35:05.823
I'm ready to talk if you're ready to listen.

01:35:06.241 --> 01:35:07.492
All right.

01:35:08.201 --> 01:35:11.829
- Miss Jackson, I'll leave you now.
- Senator, thank you.

01:35:13.498 --> 01:35:17.627
- We'll be leaving for Washington.
- Hey buddy, we'll be back later.

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.423
Mr. Toscani...

01:35:22.715 --> 01:35:26.052
...can you tell us about
your military background?

01:35:30.223 --> 01:35:33.559
In 1973, I worked for
a special operations group...

01:35:34.852 --> 01:35:37.021
...in Vietnam and Cambodia.

01:35:37.897 --> 01:35:40.775
I was involved with gathering intelligence.

01:35:40.858 --> 01:35:45.196
All of the members of this team
were doctors recruited by the CIA...

01:35:45.905 --> 01:35:49.409
...and trained at a secret camp
in Langley, Virginia.

01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:05.216
{y:i}Gentlemen, whenever you have a group
{y:i}of individuals...

01:36:05.675 --> 01:36:07.885
{y:i}... who are beyond any investigation...

01:36:07.969 --> 01:36:12.265
{y:i}... who can manipulate the press,
{y:i}judges, members of our Congress...

01:36:13.224 --> 01:36:17.395
{y:i}... you'll have within our government
{y:i}those who are above the law.
