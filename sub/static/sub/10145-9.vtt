00:00.100 --> 00:01.689
<i>Previously on Strike Back...</i>

00:01.724 --> 00:05.170
That's smallpox, right? If Al-Zuhari gets
his hands on this, thousands of people will die.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.175
Tens of thousands.

00:06.210 --> 00:09.180
- What were you uploading?
- Clean skins. Their people into the system.

00:09.215 --> 00:13.130
Reza Hassan. If Al-Zuhari's
on to Kamali, he's in trouble.

00:13.165 --> 00:14.630
They have the virus.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.445
They got Kamali.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.655
He risked his life
and I didn't trust him.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.685
- Your file from the CIA didn't mention a kid.
- Keep it that way.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.230
Al-Zuhari will bring down
a vengeance upon the West.

00:26.740 --> 00:29.580
Leo told us Al-Zuhari
would sacrifice anything.

00:29.615 --> 00:33.305
I'm telling you now, whatever
the sacrifice, it'll be made.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.270
What am I gonna say
to that little girl?

00:40.568 --> 00:42.686
BERLIN, GERMANY

00:42.900 --> 00:45.770
I am here to deliver this message.

00:47.950 --> 00:51.950
Al-Zuhari will bring down
a vengeance upon the West.

00:58.330 --> 01:00.440
This is Kamali's
executioner...

01:01.270 --> 01:03.010
Qassem Namazi,

01:03.170 --> 01:05.379
Al-Zuhari's top enforcer

01:05.440 --> 01:08.860
and infamous for his
inventive use of torture.

01:09.020 --> 01:11.120
Well, there's nothing
inventive about that, is there?

01:11.130 --> 01:14.570
True, but we have to assume they
tortured Kamali and that he broke,

01:14.600 --> 01:17.600
giving Al-Zuhari intel
he can use against us.

01:17.605 --> 01:19.230
I don't believe that.

01:19.670 --> 01:23.070
CCTV Shows Qassem Namazi
at Moscow Airport this morning,

01:23.105 --> 01:24.735
catching a flight to Berlin.

01:24.770 --> 01:28.290
Al-Zuhari will be looking for retribution
against anyone connected with Kamali.

01:28.292 --> 01:29.745
- And his family.
- Yeah.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.160
Al-Zuhari will be after
them, too. It's his M.O.

01:32.170 --> 01:35.020
- They're gonna go after Ester.
- He's here for her.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.600
She's at school outside the city.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.230
Let's go get her.

01:39.330 --> 01:42.910
OK. Protect the girl and bring her in,
but we must stay on mission.

01:43.030 --> 01:46.090
Qassem is our best chance
of finding the virus.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.610
This is what we're up against.

01:49.470 --> 01:53.809
It's a genetically engineered smallpox
with an infection rate that is terrifying.

01:54.050 --> 01:56.270
If it's released into
a populated area...

Advertise your product or brand here

02:05.130 --> 02:08.199
We don't have a vaccine,
and there is no known cure.

02:08.235 --> 02:10.300
We need all the intel we can get.

02:18.970 --> 02:21.360
Sir, they're into the Moscow crib.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.670
Kamali must have told them.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.430
You know what to do.

02:43.930 --> 02:48.255
Secure Ester and bring me a live one,
preferably Qassem.

02:48.290 --> 02:51.300
I need to know how and when
they're gonna use this weapon.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.360
Colonel, and these guys?

03:03.170 --> 03:04.940
No longer a threat.

04:23.070 --> 04:26.540
STRIKE BACK 4x09
Sub: dcdah; Edited: Szaki

04:40.480 --> 04:44.590
- What is he doing?
- What's necessary.

04:49.030 --> 04:51.600
We know your involvement
at the lab, Dr. Valigny,

04:51.635 --> 04:53.860
and we know you're
all vaccinated,

04:55.170 --> 04:57.590
and we need that vaccine.

05:01.670 --> 05:04.360
It will take you months
to extract it from my blood.

05:04.370 --> 05:08.080
Anyone infected with the strain they're
using will be dead within days.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.740
I want to see my embassy!

05:13.840 --> 05:15.040
Ok.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.680
But there is something
you need to understand.

05:30.070 --> 05:32.410
You died at the Drezna facility.

05:35.300 --> 05:39.110
So the only way you'll make it back
to your embassy is in one of these.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.370
Unless you can give
me something I can use.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.760
Takenaka dealt with a German,

05:54.480 --> 05:56.080
a businessman.

05:59.470 --> 06:02.880
Maroun Saleh.
All the supplies went through him.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.070
Maroun Saleh funded
the whole operation.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.800
Maroun Saleh. Let's go.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.810
Please let me go.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.970
No, no! No!

06:20.170 --> 06:23.590
How you feeling these days, Mikey?
You all better?

06:27.000 --> 06:31.410
No, not 100%, but, uh, I still
got your back, yeah?

06:31.920 --> 06:33.750
Yeah. I never doubted that, bud.

06:33.890 --> 06:36.450
Got to say, though, when
I picked you up from that lab,

06:36.530 --> 06:38.460
thought you were
down for the count.

06:39.490 --> 06:40.720
Yeah. So did I.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.700
You ever feel like everything
that we touch just turns to shit?

06:45.990 --> 06:48.240
This whole thing's a mess, Mike.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.680
That kid's dad's
dead because of us.

06:51.130 --> 06:54.050
Maybe we should have stayed
on that road to Mexico.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.630
Yeah, maybe.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.475
Let's see this through,

06:57.480 --> 07:02.060
keep our promise to Kamali,
make sure Ester's safe.

07:04.680 --> 07:05.990
Yeah.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.130
Eyes on Saleh.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.020
Target on the move.
He's got company.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.100
Can you grab him?

07:26.530 --> 07:28.420
Not without leaving a mess.

07:29.930 --> 07:33.560
- OK. Stay with him. Take him
if you can. - Copy that.

07:37.630 --> 07:38.990
Bloody hell.

07:39.170 --> 07:40.875
Holy fuck! That's a school?

07:40.910 --> 07:43.730
Yeah. So you're familiar
with the concept, huh?

07:43.740 --> 07:47.990
School? Yeah. It's where I learned
hot smoke, drink, and fight.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.870
All right. Let's get Ester out.
Then we'll go get Qassem, huh?

07:52.905 --> 07:54.810
Yeah. I'll be here.

08:02.930 --> 08:06.995
- Excuse me. Do you know Ester Kamali?
- Better ask them.

08:07.030 --> 08:09.580
- Those girls?
- Mm-hmm. - Thanks.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.100
Hey, girls. Sorry to interrupt.
Do you know where Ester is?

08:15.270 --> 08:17.630
- What's it to you?
- I'm a family friend.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.430
Got any money?

08:22.470 --> 08:24.500
Extortion, huh?
That's great.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.670
- Where is she?
- Her uncle gave us 50.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.410
Her uncle?

08:38.130 --> 08:40.510
Go to the left over there.
Go straight, yeah?

08:50.470 --> 08:52.000
OK. Let's go over there.

09:00.430 --> 09:03.530
Find the girl, bring in Qassem,
and I'll meet you at the car.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.140
Copy that.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.740
These balloons are cute.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.370
Mikey, eyes on Ester.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.565
- Beat it kid.
- Damien?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.200
- Sorry.
- Damien, what are you doing here?

09:19.205 --> 09:21.200
- You got to come with me.
- No. What are you doing here?

09:21.235 --> 09:22.705
Ester, we got to go.

09:22.740 --> 09:25.470
There's some guys looking for you,
and they're not very nice.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.420
- Come on. Just come on.
- I'm fine. Get off me.

09:28.455 --> 09:29.345
Ester!

09:29.350 --> 09:31.170
- Wait, Ester.
- Hey, Qassem.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.510
What are you doing here?

09:35.515 --> 09:37.591
Mikey, on me.
Qassem is here.

09:37.626 --> 09:39.760
- Can you get to him?
- It's complicated.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.080
I'm by that ride with the octopus.

09:43.070 --> 09:45.290
I found you.
We were worried.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.360
- Who's your friend?
- He's fine. He knows my dad.

09:52.370 --> 09:54.410
- Your dad is waiting. - Stop.
- Let me take you to him.

09:54.445 --> 09:56.210
- Let's go.
- Don't move!

09:57.540 --> 09:59.935
He's a friend of my dad's.
It's fine, honestly.

09:59.970 --> 10:02.500
Ester, ask him why he's here
with a bunch of killers.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.450
To protect you.

10:06.530 --> 10:11.860
I've known Ester all her life.
What's she to you, an asset, someone to use?

10:11.900 --> 10:13.015
Shut up.

10:13.020 --> 10:16.995
- Ester, that man is no friend of your dad's.
- Yeah. Where is my dad?

10:17.030 --> 10:20.722
- Come on, come on. Let's go. Come on.
- Hey! Don't fucking move.

10:20.757 --> 10:24.070
- Damien, what are you doing?
- Ester, it's all right, it's OK.

10:24.770 --> 10:28.970
What are you gonna do, huh? You gonna shoot me
here in front of everybody, huh, in front of her?

10:33.280 --> 10:35.350
- I am unarmed.
- Bullshit.

10:35.410 --> 10:37.640
You think I'd believe
any word you'd say?

10:37.645 --> 10:40.005
- Come on, Ester.
- Don't touch her. Ester, come here.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.500
- Your dad is waiting for you.
- Don't go to him. Walk to me.

10:41.535 --> 10:43.560
Your dad is waiting.
Let me take you to him. Come on.

10:43.595 --> 10:45.870
- He's not. - Come on. - Ester, he's not.
- Your dad is waiting for you.

10:45.905 --> 10:47.680
Ester.
He's not.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.813
What, you don't
want to see your dad?

10:49.848 --> 10:51.657
- Don't listen to him. - I want to see
my dad. - OK. Let's go. Come on.

10:51.658 --> 10:53.855
- Ester, you can't see him.
- Let's go. Your dad is waiting for you.

10:53.856 --> 10:56.737
- Ester. - But why? He just wants me to...
- Come on. - Why can't I go see him?

10:56.742 --> 11:00.315
Because he's dead, all right?
He shot him! I saw him do it.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.350
That's a lie. He's lying to you.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.640
- Ester.
- Ester.

11:03.650 --> 11:04.590
Shut up!

11:04.610 --> 11:07.030
Let's go to him now.
Come on, Ester.

11:07.090 --> 11:09.670
- You want to see your dad? Let's go and
see him now. - Shut up! - No!

11:12.330 --> 11:13.680
Move, move!

11:14.510 --> 11:16.780
Down, down! Go!

11:17.150 --> 11:20.470
- Where are you, Mikey?
Ester's run off. - Seconds away.

11:20.475 --> 11:22.030
Come on.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.430
Fuck!

11:25.500 --> 11:26.870
Ester!

11:58.330 --> 11:59.585
I got her, Mikey.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.630
Grab a live one, let's
get out of here, huh?

12:01.635 --> 12:03.330
<i>Roger that. I'll be in the car.</i>

12:12.630 --> 12:14.240
Is he really dead?

12:17.770 --> 12:19.680
- I'm sorry, Ester.
- No.

12:22.510 --> 12:23.980
Come here.

12:28.530 --> 12:29.960
Move, move, move!

12:30.960 --> 12:32.880
Get down! Stay there.

12:32.890 --> 12:34.680
Careful with the girl.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.290
Fuck.

13:05.010 --> 13:06.480
Cover me.

13:09.770 --> 13:11.200
Fuck.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.730
Move! Move!

13:19.200 --> 13:20.560
Go.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.840
I need to take this key.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.680
Fuck!

13:40.020 --> 13:42.845
The black Mercedes over there.
It's our car.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.430
I want you to get in it, I want to get on the floor,
and I want you to stay there.

13:45.465 --> 13:48.560
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't you worry about me, all right? - OK.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.440
On 3. Get ready to move.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.760
- Ready?
- Yep.

13:51.795 --> 13:52.730
1...

13:53.600 --> 13:54.735
We're at the back.

13:54.745 --> 13:55.530
2...

13:55.800 --> 13:59.420
Ooh, you. You better have some
fucking good intel on you, mate.

13:59.570 --> 14:02.310
3. Go!
Fuck!

14:11.970 --> 14:13.620
Cut her off!

14:17.580 --> 14:19.000
Fuck!

14:29.500 --> 14:32.135
- Sneaky little shit.
- Come on, Damien! Hurry!

14:32.170 --> 14:33.540
She drives better than me.

14:33.745 --> 14:35.800
- Move!
- Hurry up, bud.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.980
You want me to drop this intel?
He's quite heavy.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.890
And piss Locke off?
No, no, no.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.320
- Use your muscles.
- At least I have some. I'm coming to you.

14:44.990 --> 14:47.360
Ester, get in the back!
Get in the back!

14:47.395 --> 14:50.730
Come on, come on, Scott.
Fuck! Coming to you, Mikey.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.730
Come on.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.820
Open the boot, open the boot!

15:01.690 --> 15:03.620
Is that intel alive, Mike?

15:03.980 --> 15:05.540
Wake up, babe.
Wake up.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.200
Shit!

15:09.520 --> 15:12.030
He was alive!
Move, move, move!

15:51.770 --> 15:55.710
Zero, we've targeted Saleh.
Sending you visuals and coordinates.

16:00.650 --> 16:04.960
That's Reza Hassan,
Al-Zuhari's right-hand man.

16:05.150 --> 16:07.790
We lost track of him after Drezna.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.490
Full house.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.460
You all right?

16:30.530 --> 16:33.890
- Brought you that.
- No, thanks.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.940
How you doing, kid?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.700
How do you think I'm doing?

16:49.170 --> 16:50.930
I know you're hurting.

16:52.430 --> 16:54.580
How do you know
what it feels like?

16:56.630 --> 16:58.280
I'm a soldier, kid.

17:01.070 --> 17:04.470
- I know pain.
- Yeah, but he was my dad.

17:11.150 --> 17:14.170
I haven't told anyone
this before, Ester, but...

17:16.970 --> 17:18.599
I'm a dad, too.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.280
How would they feel if it was you?

17:33.300 --> 17:34.660
Honestly...

17:36.870 --> 17:38.530
don't know.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.790
Well, they must love you.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.770
They don't know me.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.900
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault, kid.

18:00.550 --> 18:02.750
You're still a dad, though, right?

18:04.030 --> 18:05.470
That's all that matters.

18:05.910 --> 18:09.620
Yeah. Not much of one, huh?

18:10.790 --> 18:13.260
Mine was hardly ever around.

18:14.340 --> 18:16.660
There always seemed
to be something else.

18:18.470 --> 18:20.550
You know, he was away a lot, and...

18:21.610 --> 18:23.690
there was always an excuse,

18:26.510 --> 18:28.520
but whenever he was away,

18:29.270 --> 18:32.060
there was a little part of me
that always knew he'd come back.

18:32.970 --> 18:34.230
Yeah.

18:48.730 --> 18:51.040
- Come here.
- He's not coming back.

18:52.050 --> 18:53.440
He's gone.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.370
- Hey. - How you doing?
- We're up.

19:22.390 --> 19:23.270
How is she?

19:24.640 --> 19:26.830
- Eh, she's a tough little kid, you know?
- Yeah.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.270
- And you?
- I'm all right.

19:34.190 --> 19:36.195
Just got to sort out
my fucking life.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.420
- I'll give you a second.
- Thanks.

19:42.230 --> 19:44.960
- Ok.
- All right. Maroun Saleh.

19:45.230 --> 19:48.320
According to Valigny, he helped fund
the Drezna facility.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.890
We track him down
to an Al-Zuhari training camp,

19:51.925 --> 19:54.997
where he met our old
friend Reza Hassan.

19:55.032 --> 19:58.170
If we can extract
these two alive... 'alive'...

19:59.160 --> 20:02.460
we have Al-Zhuari's number two
and a track line to the virus.

20:03.090 --> 20:05.965
- Make sure Scott's fully briefed,
will you? - Roger that.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.150
Mike has the intel.

20:08.950 --> 20:11.400
Do you know the difference
between a dead man and a live man?

20:11.410 --> 20:15.950
- Yeah. Dead men don't pay taxes.
- Consider yourself briefed.

20:47.190 --> 20:49.400
Zero, Bravo One
and Two in position.

20:49.435 --> 20:52.660
- Ready to extract on your command.
- Hey, Bridgey.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.270
- You good?
- Good. - Go.

21:36.130 --> 21:37.500
Moving.

22:27.490 --> 22:28.940
Shut up!

22:35.630 --> 22:37.170
Oh, shit!

22:47.830 --> 22:49.260
Moving!

22:54.560 --> 22:56.710
Hassan, Hassan,
get me out! Hassan!

23:01.140 --> 23:02.870
Zero, we got eyes on Saleh.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.090
Get him, Mikey, get him!

23:11.320 --> 23:13.570
Get away! Hands!

23:18.090 --> 23:21.360
- Not supposed to shoot him, Mikey.
- It's his leg. He'll live!

23:23.840 --> 23:25.600
Hands. Hands!

23:25.810 --> 23:27.350
Don't fucking move,
or I'll shoot you.

23:27.385 --> 23:30.247
Bravo One. We have Hassan and Saleh.
We also have a safe.

23:30.282 --> 23:33.560
We need what's in there,
and bring me one of them alive.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.880
Roger that.

23:35.810 --> 23:38.920
Open the safe. Open the safe.

23:38.930 --> 23:42.025
You, get up! Get up!
Open that safe.

23:42.060 --> 23:46.040
- Open the fucking safe right now!
- I'll do it, I'll do it. - Right now! - I'll do it.

23:58.530 --> 23:59.900
Come here!

24:00.500 --> 24:01.850
Jesus Christ!

24:01.940 --> 24:04.120
- Mike, he's gonna bleed out.
- Yeah.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.060
Open the fucking safe right now!

24:12.060 --> 24:13.450
Go ahead.

24:14.140 --> 24:16.115
I'm not afraid to die.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.090
Come on. Do it, do it!

24:18.520 --> 24:19.990
Fucking beleivers.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.260
- Do it.
- He's not gonna do it. Just blow it.

24:24.450 --> 24:26.000
Got him.

24:30.850 --> 24:32.270
Get on your fucking knees!

24:34.730 --> 24:36.110
Fuck!

24:40.420 --> 24:42.140
- Come on!
- Stay there.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.890
Fuck, Mike. Come on.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.460
Come on, bud.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.950
20 more seconds.
I need 20 more seconds.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.490
Come on. They're coming
through the door, Mike.

24:53.750 --> 24:54.780
You stay there.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.090
What are you doing,
fucking math? Blow it.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.400
It's like a Soufflé. It takes time.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.310
Ugh! Shit, Scott.

25:06.140 --> 25:07.610
Come on, Mikey.

25:21.570 --> 25:23.160
Stay there!

25:23.680 --> 25:25.100
- Good!
- We're good?

25:25.135 --> 25:26.570
Fire in the hole!

25:30.420 --> 25:34.500
That fucking worked, Michael! - Yeah, that worked.
- Did a great job on that one.

25:34.610 --> 25:36.380
- Shit, that's hot!
- Fuck!

25:38.020 --> 25:40.420
- I think I've got the important bits.
- You better hope so.

25:40.430 --> 25:41.990
- Cover me.
- Yeah.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.800
- What you got?
- I got some hard drives.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.820
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Got you.

25:47.910 --> 25:49.830
Zero, Bravo One.
We're heading for exfil.

25:49.865 --> 25:52.400
- Exfil immediate.
- Stand up! - Coming to you, Scott.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.400
This is why we don't shoot people in the leg.
Makes it hard for them to walk, bud.

25:59.415 --> 26:01.410
Yeah. Nag, nag, nag.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.530
- Fuck!
- What do you got?

26:05.410 --> 26:08.750
Got 4 or 5 of these guys.
I got eyes on Qassem, too.

26:08.930 --> 26:11.010
Zero, we have Hassan and the intel.

26:11.090 --> 26:12.275
<i>30 seconds.</i>

26:12.280 --> 26:15.080
- Tell your men to stand down.
- They'll kill me first.

26:16.530 --> 26:19.080
Let's see. Walk, walk.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.790
Back off! I'll put a bullet
in him, I swear to God!

26:32.160 --> 26:33.580
See?

26:34.420 --> 26:36.910
- Ok, ok.
- You're a popular guy.

26:38.150 --> 26:40.980
They're not gonna shoot you.
They love you.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.522
Kill me!

26:48.240 --> 26:49.580
Back, back, back, back!

26:54.990 --> 26:57.200
- Fucking hell!
- Holy shit!

26:58.030 --> 27:00.230
Zero, we need
a hot extraction now!

27:00.265 --> 27:02.160
- 30 seconds.
- Fuck off!

27:02.500 --> 27:04.290
We don't have 30 seconds!

27:19.090 --> 27:21.830
- You all right?
- Fucking kill all the guys out there, Mikey.

27:34.890 --> 27:37.570
- Shit!
- That's our fucking ride, mate.

27:38.620 --> 27:41.040
- You ready?
- All right.

27:41.590 --> 27:43.100
Drop the line.

27:46.580 --> 27:48.060
I see the rope.
The rope's down.

27:48.095 --> 27:49.830
- Going.
- Moving!

28:01.140 --> 28:02.830
On your two, Richmond.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.230
Come on! Go!

28:21.090 --> 28:22.500
Take the rope now!

28:22.540 --> 28:23.960
Go, go, go, go!

28:24.040 --> 28:25.500
- You good?
- Yeah.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.360
Welcome back.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.880
- Oh, shit!
- Hi, boss.

28:59.500 --> 29:03.530
Shit!
We're glad to see you guys.

29:05.170 --> 29:08.450
- What you got for me?
- We got the mother lode, baby!

29:11.550 --> 29:13.490
Yeah.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.140
All right.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.170
Oh, you're gonna love us.

29:22.190 --> 29:25.650
- Why is it burnt?
- Ask demolition man here.

29:26.780 --> 29:29.500
There. Computer stuff.

29:30.630 --> 29:33.470
You went in for Saleh.
Where is he?

29:33.620 --> 29:36.220
- He was killed by Hassan.
- And where's Hassan?

29:36.260 --> 29:39.600
- He was killed by Qassem.
- So, what, they all just killed each other?

29:39.635 --> 29:40.880
Yeah, pretty much.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.350
Makes you wonder why we
even needed to be there, huh?

29:44.490 --> 29:47.980
Next time, just bring me a body,
preferably warm.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.160
Yes, boss.

29:55.180 --> 29:57.180
- Good work.
- Yeah.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.980
I know what he's done.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.010
Colonel...

30:08.590 --> 30:12.270
Andersson uploaded false
identities to the NATO system.

30:12.305 --> 30:14.325
This is the first one that I found.

30:14.360 --> 30:18.740
He has a complete NATO history
going back several months,

30:18.775 --> 30:20.450
a clean skin.

30:20.930 --> 30:23.360
- How many more are there?
- I don't know.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.520
I've worked out the tag
Andersson used to mark them,

30:26.525 --> 30:29.460
but the data's too fire-damaged.

30:32.570 --> 30:34.140
So what's this guy's cover?

30:34.310 --> 30:37.360
The system has him
down as Martin Novotny,

30:37.395 --> 30:39.260
Sergeant First Class,

30:39.380 --> 30:42.740
staff liaison officer
for the Czech delegation.

30:43.090 --> 30:47.040
He's due to attend the meeting tomorrow
for the NATO military committee.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.650
Where's the delegation being held?

30:50.640 --> 30:51.935
Frankfurt.

30:51.970 --> 30:53.510
Where's Novotny now?

30:54.070 --> 30:57.340
Czech delegation boarded
an overnight train yesterday.

30:57.375 --> 30:59.570
ETA Frankfurt Central...

31:00.490 --> 31:03.010
Fuck! 2 hours, 20 minutes.

31:03.820 --> 31:07.250
That NATO meeting's the
perfect target for the virus.

31:07.620 --> 31:11.160
Give the pilot an intercept course.
Then contact NATO Command.

31:11.195 --> 31:14.190
- I want a full HAZMAT team on standby.
- Yes, sir.

31:14.510 --> 31:16.010
Right. Listen up.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.590
Novotny is our target.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.580
You lot, you're
gonna catch a train.

31:32.923 --> 31:35.747
It's 7 am, a little early
to start drinking, huh?

31:35.782 --> 31:38.313
Start?
We never stopped!

31:38.994 --> 31:41.394
We drink to you,
Sergeant Novotny!

32:51.540 --> 32:54.060
You find Novotny and you stop him.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.120
Pull up a list of
the Czech delegates.

33:29.155 --> 33:32.380
Find proof that at least one of them is
who they really claim to be.

33:32.415 --> 33:33.680
Yes, sir.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.350
Hands. Show me your hands,
show me your hands.

33:38.940 --> 33:40.805
- Sit up, hands up. - What is this?
- Look at me, look at me.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.900
- Don't fucking do that.
- Hands up, hands up.

33:42.935 --> 33:44.970
- Look at me. - I got him. Don't worry.
- Don't be a hero.

33:45.660 --> 33:47.060
Look at me.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.610
- Who the hell are you people?
- Ticket inspectors.

33:51.540 --> 33:52.675
He's not here.

33:52.710 --> 33:54.715
- What is this?
- She'll explain.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.720
Yeah, right. You go ahead.
I'll just deal with the diplomacy.

33:57.755 --> 33:59.460
Diplomacy's overrated anyway.

33:59.510 --> 34:03.310
It's OK. We're NATO forces.
Just here looking for somebody.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.270
Get the fuck out of
the way! Get down!

34:12.570 --> 34:14.239
Captain, I got to go.

34:22.510 --> 34:23.889
Is she OK?

34:24.380 --> 34:27.969
I'm hit, and Novotny was not
alone on the train.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.264
<i>I took one out, but
there may be others.</i>

34:30.270 --> 34:32.370
Bravo 3, hang tight.
We'll get you out.

34:32.580 --> 34:36.060
I've got it. Major
General Anton Palecek.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.780
Get me through to him.

34:40.989 --> 34:42.469
We've got eyes on target.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.945
Fuck! Motherfucker.

34:45.980 --> 34:48.570
Zero, he's released the
virus in the carriage.

34:48.580 --> 34:51.050
We got about 20 or
30 civilians in there.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.330
He's got some
friends with him, too.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.050
What the hell are you doing?

35:00.690 --> 35:03.250
Motherfucker! Fuck!

35:05.000 --> 35:06.375
Oi! Stop!

35:06.410 --> 35:07.960
That carriage is
infected, all right?

35:07.975 --> 35:09.700
My girlfriend is in there.
I have to go inside.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.155
- No, no, no, no!
- Stay here.

35:11.156 --> 35:14.270
You go in there, you touch that door,
I shoot you, am I clear?

35:15.190 --> 35:17.060
- Yes.
- Sorry, kid.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.470
Let's go up and over.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.050
- I want to get out!
- Don't panic, don't panic.

35:37.085 --> 35:39.530
Listen to me. They told me there
is a virus inside.

35:39.565 --> 35:40.400
What?!

35:43.000 --> 35:44.400
Nice work, Spider-Man.

35:44.460 --> 35:47.550
Screw, Spider-Man, dude.
Guy wears tights.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.660
Sir, Palecek.

36:00.730 --> 36:04.600
General Palecek, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Philip Locke, British Special Forces.

36:04.710 --> 36:07.280
<i>As I'm sure you're aware,
we have an emergency.</i>

36:07.620 --> 36:09.895
A level 4 contagion
has been released.

36:09.930 --> 36:12.135
Do not let anyone
out of that carriage.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.465
- I repeat. Do not let anyone
out of that carriage. - Sir.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.890
It's stuck.

36:17.470 --> 36:19.580
Listen to me, listen.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.745
No one is to leave this carriage,

36:22.780 --> 36:26.580
and I will shoot the
first person who tries.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.005
You have to unhook
the infected carriage.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.330
5 minutes before it
reaches a populated area.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.890
- Do you copy?
- Zero, we copy. We're gonna blow the coupling.

36:44.980 --> 36:47.370
- We can't let it reach the city.
- Roger that.

36:52.510 --> 36:53.810
You want me to do it?

36:53.813 --> 36:56.555
After the safe?
I got this one, I think.

36:56.590 --> 36:59.730
All right. Well, there's a
first time for everything. C4's in here.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.100
Let's go. I'm gonna push
forward and find Novotny.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.700
Don't blow yourself up.

37:07.580 --> 37:08.900
Fuck!

37:10.050 --> 37:11.350
Mike!

37:11.830 --> 37:13.270
I'm all right!

37:50.680 --> 37:52.220
Scott, grenade!

38:07.230 --> 38:10.450
Bravo Two, Bravo Two!

38:13.650 --> 38:15.430
He didn't blow the carriages.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.340
- Bravo One, we've lost Bravo Two.
- Shit!

38:18.690 --> 38:22.480
You've got to stay on mission.
You have to stop that train, Michael.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.080
Roger that.

38:43.580 --> 38:44.980
Fuck.

38:51.140 --> 38:52.510
Alles OK?

38:52.870 --> 38:55.630
Yeah. I'm all good, kid.

38:57.470 --> 38:58.520
That's a nice bike.

39:25.250 --> 39:28.240
- Hey, buddy boy!
- Didn't you just die?

39:29.090 --> 39:30.920
Go stop the train!

39:31.240 --> 39:33.010
I'm going after Novotny!

39:47.280 --> 39:48.620
Zero...

39:49.090 --> 39:51.850
<i>Novotny's killed the driver
and disabled the brake.</i>

39:51.855 --> 39:54.030
One minute until
you hit the suburbs.

39:54.770 --> 39:57.910
<i>Bravo Two, whatever it takes,
stop the train.</i>

40:12.540 --> 40:14.190
Get out of the fucking truck!

40:14.530 --> 40:18.490
Get out of the fucking truck!
Out! Now.

40:19.440 --> 40:20.760
Fuck off!

40:40.830 --> 40:42.240
Fuck.

40:57.790 --> 40:59.360
Fuck! Honestly.

41:05.361 --> 41:06.661
Fuck!

41:39.950 --> 41:42.400
- Fucking pussy of a dog.
- Mike?

41:46.250 --> 41:48.260
What's it take to kill you, huh?

41:49.900 --> 41:51.610
Grid reference
coordinates locked in.

41:51.645 --> 41:53.980
- HAZMAT team on their way.
- Roger.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.160
We've got a live one there!

42:05.160 --> 42:07.080
He's not very alive, Mikey.

42:07.620 --> 42:09.820
- Oh, shit.
- Boss ain't gonna like that.

42:10.310 --> 42:13.765
Bravo One and Bravo Two here.
Uh, we stopped the train.

42:13.800 --> 42:16.350
Novotny's dead. I repeat.
Our intel is dead.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.360
- What's going on?
- They are coming to help you, OK?

42:25.960 --> 42:27.390
I'm sorry.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.100
So that was your idea of
how to stop a train, was it?

42:33.140 --> 42:36.850
- We stopped it, didn't we?
- Good job, Scott.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.650
These people got any chance?

42:39.950 --> 42:42.790
- Only if we can find a cure.
- So no.

42:44.650 --> 42:46.570
You had me worried for a second.

42:48.570 --> 42:50.405
Yeah? Heh.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.870
Now is this what you have
to do to get a day off?

42:53.830 --> 42:57.110
- That was some stunt you
guys pulled back there. - Yeah. Thanks.

43:00.980 --> 43:02.920
- You take care of yourself, yeah?
- Yeah. You, too.

43:03.670 --> 43:07.230
If I'm not gonna get a hug, give me
one of those famous Limey handshakes.

43:09.570 --> 43:10.950
See you soon.

43:17.590 --> 43:21.150
<i>In the name of Allah
the great and merciful,</i>

43:21.460 --> 43:24.640
<i>you must cleanse
yourselves of your sins,</i>

43:24.830 --> 43:27.995
as he has promised us
that paradise awaits

43:28.030 --> 43:32.090
<i>those of you who lay down
your lives in this war,</i>

43:33.090 --> 43:37.790
<i>fighting for our freedom
and what we believe.</i>

43:39.830 --> 43:42.320
Sir, a message from Pirogova.

43:42.410 --> 43:45.730
Ulyanov has left his Dacha in Moscow.
He's on the move.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.550
He's heading for Germany.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.490
He's coming for the boys, isn't he?

43:50.650 --> 43:53.050
- Tell Pirogova to stay with him.
- Sir.

44:05.550 --> 44:08.615
{\an8}SECTION 20 SAFE HOUSE, BERLIN

44:06.650 --> 44:09.100
Did you see the size of him?
He was a fucking sasquatch.

44:09.110 --> 44:13.530
- Now he threw you off the train.
- Fuck you! Next time, you fight the big guy.

44:13.800 --> 44:16.090
Sore, huh? Good.

44:16.170 --> 44:19.080
- So what did you buy Ester?
- I don't know, dude.

44:19.100 --> 44:21.220
Some shitty German mags.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.850
I did get her these.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.190
- She's gonna love those,
mate. They're brilliant. - You think?

44:27.520 --> 44:30.420
I have no idea. I don't know
what teenage girls like.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.030
Neither do I. Poor kid.

44:33.670 --> 44:35.540
We're all she's got.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.080
Scott... the door.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.240
- Yeah.
- Go.

44:44.660 --> 44:46.900
Zero, safe house
has been breached.

44:53.700 --> 44:55.290
- Going up.
- Yeah.

45:11.490 --> 45:12.880
Ester?

45:17.720 --> 45:19.810
Hands! Hands!

45:27.000 --> 45:28.820
What the fuck?

45:46.040 --> 45:48.330
Ester? Ester?

45:48.880 --> 45:50.160
Damien?

45:50.700 --> 45:52.650
Come here. Come on.

45:53.140 --> 45:55.110
- You all right? - Yeah.
- Scott! Scott!

45:56.210 --> 45:58.515
No. No, no, no. Don't.

45:58.550 --> 46:00.785
Qassem, put that gun down.

46:00.820 --> 46:03.655
- Put that gun down. - No, Damien.
- Put that fucking gun down!

46:03.660 --> 46:05.455
- Put that fucking gun down!
- Please, Damien. No more killing!

46:05.460 --> 46:08.960
- He was never going to kill her.
- What are you talking about, Mikey?

46:18.270 --> 46:19.660
Dad?
