Minister: "Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

00:07.323 --> 00:09.190
- _
- I will fear no evil:

00:09.192 --> 00:10.658
For thou art with me;

00:10.660 --> 00:13.427
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

00:13.429 --> 00:16.062
Thou preparest a table before me

00:16.065 --> 00:18.633
in the presence of mine enemies:

00:18.635 --> 00:21.435
Thou anointest my head with oil;

00:21.437 --> 00:23.070
my cup runneth over.

00:23.072 --> 00:25.139
Surely goodness and mercy

00:25.141 --> 00:28.109
shall follow me all the days of my life:

00:28.111 --> 00:32.079
And I will dwell in the
house of the lord for ever."

00:40.355 --> 00:44.991
We were just children
when we lost everything...

00:44.993 --> 00:49.029
Our parents, our home,

00:49.031 --> 00:51.131
our innocence.

00:51.133 --> 00:54.134
Once envied by all our neighbors,

00:54.136 --> 00:57.437
suddenly, we found ourselves cast off,

00:57.439 --> 01:01.474
stranded at a bus depot
with $30 in our pockets

01:01.476 --> 01:03.376
and no hope in sight.

01:03.378 --> 01:06.211
That was when Henny found us.

01:06.213 --> 01:09.515
And she brought us to Dr. Sheffield.

01:09.517 --> 01:13.185
Or, as Paul would say, she brought us home.

01:13.187 --> 01:16.022
He took us in. He adopted us.

01:16.024 --> 01:18.457
He sent us to the best schools.

01:18.459 --> 01:20.492
But more than that,

01:20.494 --> 01:25.130
he made my brother and sister
and I feel safe and loved.

01:25.132 --> 01:27.733
Paul's in a better place now.

01:27.735 --> 01:29.201
We all know that.

01:32.205 --> 01:36.141
But we will never forget him.

01:36.143 --> 01:38.843
We will never forget our past.

Henny: Miss Cathy?

02:43.141 --> 02:44.440
Miss Cathy?

02:46.476 --> 02:48.911
How you holding up, baby?

02:52.116 --> 02:54.150
I'm doing okay, Henny.

02:55.385 --> 02:58.121
Listen...

02:58.123 --> 02:59.822
I just want you to know

02:59.824 --> 03:02.625
that I will always be here for you.

03:02.627 --> 03:05.461
Dr. Sheffield made sure of that, okay?

03:05.463 --> 03:07.796
Thank you.

03:18.841 --> 03:21.510
Carrie's having a pretty rough time.

03:24.814 --> 03:28.551
[Sniffling]

03:28.553 --> 03:30.785
Carrie.

03:30.787 --> 03:32.720
[Sobbing]

03:32.762 --> 03:35.630
Will we have to leave
again, like when daddy died?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.499
No.

03:37.501 --> 03:40.502
This is our home.

03:40.504 --> 03:42.870
Paul left it for us.

03:45.608 --> 03:47.675
We're gonna be just fine.

03:47.677 --> 03:49.710
[Sniffling]

04:32.519 --> 04:35.120
Bart: Corrine, the car is here.

04:35.122 --> 04:37.590
Be right there.

04:43.597 --> 04:44.830
[Sighs]

04:44.832 --> 04:46.465
Everyone is waiting for us.

04:46.467 --> 04:49.534
You don't want to be
late to your own party.

04:49.536 --> 04:51.369
Do I look okay?

04:55.441 --> 04:57.509
[Laughs]

04:57.511 --> 04:59.711
Enchanting.

04:59.713 --> 05:01.680
Oh, my God. Charity be damned.

05:01.682 --> 05:03.448
I'd rather just stay home.

05:03.450 --> 05:04.649
[Laughs]

05:04.651 --> 05:08.152
[Telephone ringing]

05:09.522 --> 05:13.290
No, no, no. Let it ring. Let it ring.

05:13.292 --> 05:14.858
[Chuckles]

05:14.860 --> 05:18.295
Hello? This is Corrine Winslow.

05:18.297 --> 05:19.896
Hello?

05:19.898 --> 05:22.333
Mom, hi.

05:22.335 --> 05:23.634
It's Cathy.

05:29.474 --> 05:31.342
[Dial tone]

05:37.482 --> 05:39.249
What'd she say?

05:39.251 --> 05:41.517
Nothing. She hung up.

05:43.721 --> 05:48.491
Ever since Paul died, I
can't stop thinking about her.

05:48.493 --> 05:51.527
How could a complete stranger love us

05:51.529 --> 05:52.829
and she couldn't?

06:06.778 --> 06:09.445
There's no point to
asking questions like that.

06:09.447 --> 06:13.283
Don't you ever think about the past?

06:13.285 --> 06:16.218
What good would that do?

06:16.220 --> 06:19.021
We all just need to work hard

06:19.023 --> 06:22.425
to build a new future for ourselves.

06:22.427 --> 06:25.295
It's what Paul would have wanted.

06:27.264 --> 06:31.000
And leap. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

06:31.002 --> 06:33.067
Point your toe. Push it, Richard.

06:33.069 --> 06:35.304
This is not a grade-school recital.

06:35.306 --> 06:37.539
Perfection is not
something you're born with.

06:37.541 --> 06:42.311
It takes practice, devotion, pain.

06:42.313 --> 06:47.248
<i>The trick is to not
look like you're in pain.</i>

06:49.519 --> 06:51.920
My son back from New York.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.459
Julian dances

06:58.461 --> 07:01.629
with the second-best
ballet company in the city.

07:06.068 --> 07:09.137
I see they've broken a
few of your bad habits.

07:15.710 --> 07:17.610
Faster, faster!

07:17.612 --> 07:18.812
Again!

07:24.518 --> 07:26.519
Again.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.923
Up! Up!

07:29.925 --> 07:31.825
Faster, faster, faster!

07:31.827 --> 07:33.526
Use your head!

07:35.429 --> 07:36.563
Better.

07:36.565 --> 07:38.465
[Sighs]

07:39.900 --> 07:42.502
[Indistinct conversation]

07:42.504 --> 07:44.404
[Inhales sharply]

07:44.406 --> 07:45.372
Ouch.

07:47.441 --> 07:48.875
Doesn't bother me.

07:48.877 --> 07:50.877
Have you tried lamb's wool?

07:50.879 --> 07:52.445
No.

07:55.081 --> 07:58.016
And if you tape up between the toes,

07:58.018 --> 08:00.318
it'll stop the toes rubbing.

08:05.492 --> 08:09.027
You want to dance for yourself,
not for my mother's approval.

08:09.029 --> 08:11.062
Believe me...

08:11.064 --> 08:13.164
nothing's good enough to her.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.969
Not even perfection.

08:28.014 --> 08:29.781
<i>Narrator: By increased secretion</i>

08:58.543 --> 09:02.445
<i>The pubescent girl is usually

09:02.447 --> 09:04.347
The patient was admitted this morning

09:04.349 --> 09:06.449
with shortness of breath and palpitations.

09:06.451 --> 09:07.783
Sounds like congestive heart failure.

09:07.785 --> 09:09.018
Leading to pulmonary edema.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.187
With no fluid in the lungs?

09:11.189 --> 09:12.956
Patient's got a history of anemia.

09:12.958 --> 09:14.824
It could be a glucose-6 deficiency.

09:14.826 --> 09:17.760
It's nice to know that one of
you has cracked open his textbook.

09:17.762 --> 09:19.127
Sarah: Dr. Reeves...

09:19.129 --> 09:21.564
I hope you didn't forget
about our dinner date.

09:22.799 --> 09:25.768
Well, aren't you going to introduce me?

09:25.770 --> 09:27.937
- All right.
- These are my third-years.

09:27.939 --> 09:30.873
This is Jack, Ed, and Christopher.

09:30.875 --> 09:31.907
My daughter, Sarah.

09:31.909 --> 09:33.442
Christopher: Hello.

09:33.444 --> 09:34.192
You're the Christopher Sheffield

09:34.195 --> 09:36.812
my father's always talking about.

09:36.814 --> 09:39.413
- Nothing too bad, I hope.
- No. Just...

09:39.415 --> 09:41.883
well, I just thought
you'd look more studious.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.352
All right, gentlemen,

09:44.354 --> 09:45.887
let's lay off the Martinis this weekend.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.789
I'll see you all in
surgical on Monday morning.

09:47.791 --> 09:48.790
Nice to meet you.

[Crows cawing]

[Groans]

09:59.569 --> 10:00.601
Oh.

10:02.104 --> 10:03.570
What is it this time?

10:03.572 --> 10:05.072
I was in the middle of a luncheon.

10:05.074 --> 10:07.441
Don't trust her.

10:07.443 --> 10:08.909
I'm sorry to bother you,

10:08.911 --> 10:11.612
but your mother's extremely
agitated this morning.

10:11.614 --> 10:13.080
Nothing I do will calm her.

10:13.082 --> 10:16.083
She... she...

10:16.085 --> 10:18.886
poisoned them.

10:18.888 --> 10:21.255
Mother, you've had a stroke.

10:21.257 --> 10:23.457
Now, you need to stop bothering the nurse

10:23.459 --> 10:24.925
with this made-up nonsense.

10:24.927 --> 10:26.927
After a stroke, it's quite common

10:26.929 --> 10:28.896
for a patient to suffer memory loss,

10:28.898 --> 10:30.731
even hallucinations.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.132
Miss Olivia...

10:32.134 --> 10:34.568
- She...
- ... Would you like to try having some lunch?

10:34.570 --> 10:36.904
poisoned her children.

10:36.906 --> 10:38.572
She poisoned them.

10:38.574 --> 10:39.840
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?

10:39.842 --> 10:41.575
I can see to my mother.

10:41.577 --> 10:44.845
Oh. Well, I believe that
would do her a world of good.

10:44.847 --> 10:46.647

10:46.649 --> 10:47.915
Good afternoon, Miss Olivia.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.650

finally turned to mush.

11:04.799 --> 11:07.266

11:07.268 --> 11:09.936
You can't feed yourself.
You can't dress yourself.

11:09.938 --> 11:12.104
You really require round-the-clock care.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.773
Now, if you're willing
to go to a nursing home...

11:14.775 --> 11:17.042
No, no, no.

one of the most impressive
homes in all of Virginia.

11:34.095 --> 11:37.696
It was so grand, so imposing.

You're going to go to hell.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.904
So you've told me... many times.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.920
Maybe I just don't like chit-chat.

12:37.922 --> 12:39.556
- I should go.
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.792
You think that I'm criticizing you?

12:42.794 --> 12:44.127
Aren't you?

12:44.129 --> 12:45.928
When you dance, it's like you're...

12:45.930 --> 12:47.263
you're dying to cut loose,

12:47.265 --> 12:49.798
but then just before
you do, you chicken out.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.901
You don't know anything abut me.

12:52.903 --> 12:56.938
I know that you're ambitious...

12:56.940 --> 12:59.608
passionate.

12:59.610 --> 13:02.077
And I'm willing to bet
you've got bigger dreams

13:02.079 --> 13:04.313
than just dancing in
some rinky-dink company

13:04.315 --> 13:06.848
before trading in your tutu

13:06.850 --> 13:10.819
for a white picket fence and
a bunch of squalling kids.

13:10.821 --> 13:15.191
No. You've got something to prove.

13:15.193 --> 13:18.627
You won't be happy until the
whole world is applauding you

13:18.629 --> 13:20.796

32:30.553 --> 32:31.787
Good night.

32:31.789 --> 32:33.989
Good night.

32:39.228 --> 32:41.129
Is it up?

32:41.131 --> 32:42.998
[Indistinct conversations]

32:43.000 --> 32:44.466
Woman: Congrats, Yolanda.

32:47.470 --> 32:49.805
I'm so happy for you.

32:49.807 --> 32:51.173
Congratulations.

32:51.175 --> 32:53.275
Better luck next time, bonita.

32:53.277 --> 32:56.811
Principals and soloists I want to see

32:56.813 --> 33:00.181
in the rehearsal hall in five minutes.

33:10.125 --> 33:12.360
[Door opens]

33:15.897 --> 33:18.966
Long rehearsal?

33:18.968 --> 33:21.001
Get me an aspirin, will you?

33:21.003 --> 33:22.636
I've got a screaming headache.

33:25.707 --> 33:29.776
Did you take Yolanda
out for some moonshine?

33:29.778 --> 33:32.913
Last thing I need right
now is flak from you.

33:32.915 --> 33:34.882
Give me the damn aspirin.

33:40.955 --> 33:43.056
I'm going home.

33:45.025 --> 33:47.627
My brother's graduating
from medical school tomorrow,

33:47.629 --> 33:48.729
and I want to be there.

33:48.731 --> 33:51.129
Are you kidding me?

33:51.131 --> 33:53.799
Why would I stay? I'm... I'm background.

33:53.801 --> 33:55.167
Nobody's gonna miss me.

33:55.169 --> 33:58.604
What is it with your brother, anyway?

33:58.606 --> 34:00.105
Hmm? He just... [snaps fingers]

34:00.107 --> 34:02.040
snaps his fingers, and you come running?

34:02.042 --> 34:03.942
Is that how it works?

34:03.944 --> 34:05.244
No.

34:05.246 --> 34:07.012
No.

34:07.014 --> 34:10.047
He doesn't have anybody
else. It's just me and Carrie.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.350
Yeah, well, who do I have, huh?

34:12.786 --> 34:14.453
Who do I have?!

34:14.455 --> 34:16.621
You should want to be here for me.

34:16.623 --> 34:18.724
Julian, please.

34:18.726 --> 34:19.725
Aah!

34:19.726 --> 34:21.559
You're not leaving me. Hmm?

34:21.561 --> 34:23.862
If I say I want you
dancing in the background,

34:23.864 --> 34:25.225
you damn well better do it!

34:25.297 --> 34:27.965
Do you understand?!

34:27.967 --> 34:29.868
Unh! Aah!

34:29.870 --> 34:31.835
[Crying]

34:31.838 --> 34:34.304
You belong to me, Cathy,
whether you know it or not.

34:34.306 --> 34:38.610
If any man gets between
us, even your brother...

34:38.612 --> 34:40.844
I'll kill him.

34:40.847 --> 34:42.647
[Sobbing]

34:42.649 --> 34:44.783
And I'll kill you, too.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.956
[Door opens]

34:53.958 --> 34:55.726
[Door slams]

35:02.536 --> 35:05.770
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Smile. Perfect.

35:05.772 --> 35:08.272
Well, I guess we should
go in and find our seats.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.841
[Gasps] Cathy's here.

35:13.925 --> 35:15.659
I'm not late?

35:15.661 --> 35:17.961
I told the cab driver it
was a medical emergency.

35:17.963 --> 35:20.030
I've missed you.

35:20.032 --> 35:23.033
I missed you, too.

35:23.035 --> 35:25.169
Dr. Sheffield, I presume.

35:26.736 --> 35:27.937
You came.

35:27.939 --> 35:30.206
I wouldn't miss your graduation...

35:30.208 --> 35:31.840
rehearsal or no rehearsal.

35:31.842 --> 35:33.776
Hi.

35:33.778 --> 35:36.279
You must be Cathy.

35:37.981 --> 35:39.848
Uh, I'm sorry.

35:39.850 --> 35:41.684
Cathy, this is, uh, Sarah Reeves.

35:41.686 --> 35:43.752
I'm Christopher's girlfriend.

35:43.754 --> 35:47.222
I'm so excited to finally meet you.

35:47.224 --> 35:48.957
I feel like I already know you,

35:48.959 --> 35:52.260
'cause you're pretty much all
Christopher ever talks about...

35:52.262 --> 35:53.661
what a wonderful ballerina you are

35:53.663 --> 35:55.130
and how close you've always been.

35:55.132 --> 35:56.532
It's lovely to meet you.

35:56.535 --> 35:58.268
Well, I can't wait to
hear all about New York

35:58.270 --> 36:00.603
and what it's like to be
a real, live ballerina.

36:00.605 --> 36:03.907
Your life is pretty much
every little girl's dream.

36:05.109 --> 36:06.676
I'm sorry.

36:06.678 --> 36:09.012
I'm sure the two of you'd like to catch up.

36:09.014 --> 36:11.047
Cathy, we'll save you a seat inside.

36:17.988 --> 36:19.522
I'm sorry I never told you.

36:19.524 --> 36:21.858
It just never seemed like the right time.

36:21.860 --> 36:23.259
She seems lovely.

36:23.261 --> 36:25.894
- Are you okay? You seem...
- I'm fine.

36:28.598 --> 36:30.065
What happened to your eye?

36:30.067 --> 36:31.767
I'm stupid. I was at a rehearsal,

36:31.769 --> 36:34.603
and I wasn't watching where I was going.

36:34.605 --> 36:36.738
I walked straight into a wall.

36:36.740 --> 36:40.108
Cathy, if something were
wrong, you would tell me, right?

36:40.110 --> 36:41.877
Christopher, stop it.

36:41.879 --> 36:47.147
This is your special day,
and I am perfectly fine.

36:48.951 --> 36:50.785
Like your girlfriend said,

36:50.787 --> 36:53.621
I'm living every little girl's dream.

37:21.316 --> 37:23.883
I didn't think you'd come back.

37:28.022 --> 37:29.889
Neither did I.

37:29.891 --> 37:31.858
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

37:31.860 --> 37:34.228
I...

37:34.230 --> 37:36.863
I'm a bastard when I drink.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.208
I'll do anything you want,
baby. Just forgive me, please.

37:49.210 --> 37:50.709
Just...

37:52.812 --> 37:55.681
just tell me what you want, and I'll do it.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.720
Cathy, look at me.

38:05.725 --> 38:07.993
I'm sorry.

38:07.995 --> 38:10.696
[Crying]

38:15.302 --> 38:18.070
I'm so sorry.

38:22.742 --> 38:26.511
Tell me what you want
me to do, and I'll do it.

38:54.106 --> 38:55.807
[Indistinct conversation]

38:55.809 --> 38:58.410
You need to keep this area
clear for the principals.

38:58.412 --> 39:00.812
I don't want to be tripping over your crap.

39:00.814 --> 39:02.480
Come on. Let's go.

39:02.482 --> 39:03.881
Hmm?

39:14.492 --> 39:16.260
[Screams]

39:16.262 --> 39:18.095
My foot!

39:18.097 --> 39:19.763
[Sobs]

39:19.765 --> 39:23.000
[Birds chirping]

39:23.032 --> 39:24.765
Bart: The nurse just phoned.

39:24.767 --> 39:26.799
Your mother's refusing to take a bath.

39:26.801 --> 39:30.336
She can just stew in her own juices.

39:30.338 --> 39:32.472
I'm sorry. Did I sound too cruel?

39:32.474 --> 39:35.875
No. I'm pretty sure your
mother owns the patent on that.

39:37.110 --> 39:38.744
What's all this?

39:38.746 --> 39:42.014
I hired an architect to
renovate Foxworth Hall.

39:42.016 --> 39:43.816
Without telling me?

39:43.818 --> 39:45.685
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to exclude you.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.619
I just didn't expect you to run your firm

39:47.621 --> 39:49.388
and oversee a full-scale renovation.

39:49.390 --> 39:52.424
When you say "full-scale"...

39:52.426 --> 39:54.159
I want to gut it completely.

39:54.161 --> 39:57.229
I want to drive out the
darkness and bring in the light.

39:57.231 --> 39:58.830
Don't tell me that means

39:58.832 --> 40:00.865
your mother's gonna finally
go to a nursing home.

40:00.867 --> 40:02.133
Of course not.

40:02.135 --> 40:04.069
But I'm done living under her thumb.

40:04.071 --> 40:06.938
If she won't move out, then
I'll just work around her.

40:08.708 --> 40:11.176
Please say you're okay with my little plan.

40:11.178 --> 40:12.977
Please say you're okay with it.

40:12.979 --> 40:15.980
I just don't want you
taking on too much right now.

40:15.982 --> 40:17.348
But I'm better. I'm better.

40:17.350 --> 40:19.150
I'm so much better than I was before.

40:19.152 --> 40:23.054
You've been so good
and so patient and kind.

40:23.056 --> 40:24.522
This isn't just for me.

40:24.524 --> 40:27.192
It's... it's a new start for both of us.

40:27.194 --> 40:29.327
Okay.

40:33.998 --> 40:37.901
Ladies always leave and enter
a room without being heard,

40:37.903 --> 40:40.871
so excellent time to practice now.

40:40.873 --> 40:43.474
Oh, no. It can't be gone.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.044
What's wrong?

40:47.046 --> 40:50.180
Nothing.

40:50.182 --> 40:52.216
Is it your doll?

40:52.218 --> 40:53.951
She is really beautiful.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.622
[Voice breaking] My mother gave it to me.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.358
It's the only thing I have from her.

41:03.427 --> 41:06.563
Don't tell Lacey I told you, but...

41:06.565 --> 41:10.500
I heard her telling Sissy
Towers to steal your doll

41:10.502 --> 41:14.071
and hide it in the
third-floor storage closet.

41:14.073 --> 41:16.472
Thanks.

41:52.208 --> 41:54.309
What do we have here?

41:54.311 --> 41:57.612
Aren't you a little old to play with dolls?

41:57.614 --> 42:00.182
You weren't trying to help me at all.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.984
Why would I want to help a freak?

42:02.986 --> 42:07.054
<i>Why don't you do us a favor
and put your head in that noose.</i>

42:07.056 --> 42:09.990
You better leave me alone, or
I'm gonna tell Miss Calhoun.

42:09.992 --> 42:12.592
You'd better just keep your mouth shut.

42:12.594 --> 42:14.929
Come on, Ashley. You heard her.

42:14.931 --> 42:17.064
The freak wants to be alone.

42:17.066 --> 42:18.365
No!

42:18.367 --> 42:19.834
Maybe if you're lucky,

42:19.836 --> 42:21.435
they'll find you in time for graduation.

42:21.437 --> 42:23.237
[Pounding on door]

42:23.239 --> 42:25.372
Open the door!

42:25.374 --> 42:26.640
[Pounding continues]

42:26.642 --> 42:28.242
Open it!

42:37.218 --> 42:39.352
[Sobbing]

42:39.354 --> 42:41.087
[Screaming]

42:48.561 --> 42:50.696
George: Eyes on her the whole time, Julian.

42:56.770 --> 42:59.137
Lift in arabesque.

42:59.139 --> 43:02.807
Slide your balance.

43:02.809 --> 43:04.475
Lovely.

43:09.748 --> 43:12.684
And let the feeling carry you.

43:42.447 --> 43:45.549
And drape yourself over him.

43:52.457 --> 43:53.457
Beautiful.

43:53.459 --> 43:55.325
Beautiful.

43:55.327 --> 43:57.728
[Breathing heavily]

43:59.364 --> 44:01.480
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:03.669 --> 44:05.002
What are you doing here?

44:05.004 --> 44:07.404
I was hoping I could
stay with you for a while.

44:07.406 --> 44:08.538
Don't you have finals?

44:08.540 --> 44:10.607
I just really missed you.

44:10.609 --> 44:12.843
Is it those girls at school?
Are they being mean to you?

44:12.845 --> 44:14.678
No. It's just Christopher's so busy now,

44:14.680 --> 44:16.380
and he's got Sarah.

44:16.382 --> 44:18.582
I thought I could just
finish school in New York.

44:18.584 --> 44:20.384
- Cathy, we're rehearsing act 2.
- Julian...

44:20.386 --> 44:23.219
You remember my sister, Carrie.

44:23.221 --> 44:25.422
It's a little early for opening night.

44:25.424 --> 44:26.757
Actually, she was hoping

44:26.759 --> 44:28.725
that she could stay with us for a while.

44:28.727 --> 44:30.660
I won't be any trouble, I promise.

44:30.662 --> 44:31.861
I can cook and clean.

44:31.863 --> 44:33.529
I can help out around the house.

44:33.531 --> 44:36.565
If it makes Cathy happy,
then it's fine with me.

44:41.304 --> 44:43.773
You know, the original
woodwork on the staircase

44:43.775 --> 44:46.609
is all hand-carved and
really a work of art.

44:46.611 --> 44:48.043
It could be stripped and refinished,

44:48.045 --> 44:49.812
which would be considerably less expensive.

44:49.814 --> 44:51.647
Well, I don't care about the expense.

44:51.649 --> 44:53.047
I want it removed.

44:53.049 --> 44:54.816
When you walk in, I want it to feel

44:54.818 --> 44:56.551
like it's an entirely different house.

44:56.553 --> 45:00.254
Well, okay. It's your money.

45:00.256 --> 45:01.589
Yes, it is.

45:01.591 --> 45:03.224
[Both laugh]

45:03.226 --> 45:05.126
Well, I guess the only other thing

45:05.128 --> 45:07.028
that we have left to talk about is

45:07.030 --> 45:08.797
the, uh, guest room and the attic.

45:08.799 --> 45:10.264
I've made some renderings.

45:10.266 --> 45:11.966
Well, I told you no one's to go in there.

45:11.968 --> 45:14.402
Oh, I just figured since you
were doing everything else...

45:14.404 --> 45:15.903
it's... it's a massive amount of space.

45:15.905 --> 45:17.371
No, I want it to disappear.

45:17.373 --> 45:18.872
I want you to remove the door,

45:18.874 --> 45:20.441
and I want you to plaster over it.

45:20.443 --> 45:22.776
Well, there's some furniture
and some things up there,

45:22.778 --> 45:23.945
some children's things.

45:23.947 --> 45:25.879
I told you to get rid of it!

45:25.881 --> 45:28.849
If you want this job, you'll do as I say,

45:28.851 --> 45:31.953
or I'll find someone else who will.

45:31.955 --> 45:34.487
Okay.

45:40.297 --> 45:42.232
[Grunts] I'm hopeless.

45:42.234 --> 45:45.800
Henny: You need to use a lighter touch.

45:45.802 --> 45:49.405
A good crust suffers
from too much kneading.

45:49.407 --> 45:52.341
Well, I hope I get the
hang of it by next Saturday.

45:52.343 --> 45:54.943
Susan and Jim invited
us over for a barbecue,

45:54.945 --> 45:56.878
and I promised to bring the pie.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.415
- I'll be in New York.
- What?

45:59.417 --> 46:03.052
Cathy has her debut in "Romeo and Juliet."

46:03.054 --> 46:04.420
Oh.

46:06.589 --> 46:08.456
You didn't tell me.

46:08.458 --> 46:11.926
I just wanted to be there for her.

46:13.695 --> 46:15.729
Of course you should go.

46:15.731 --> 46:18.599
You know, I think it's really sweet

46:18.601 --> 46:20.968
how much you love your sister.

46:20.970 --> 46:23.671
[Applause]

47:15.188 --> 47:18.891
She'll be off stage in just a minute.

47:18.893 --> 47:20.827
Thanks.

47:27.467 --> 47:29.635
What the hell are you doing?

59:39.494 --> 59:41.927
I'm sorry.

59:41.929 --> 59:43.862
Do you have children?

59:43.864 --> 59:45.931
I do... a son, Jory.

59:45.933 --> 59:47.967
- How fun.
- So much fun.

59:47.969 --> 59:50.769
I can't imagine my life without him.

59:50.771 --> 59:53.672
Sorry. That was thoughtless.

59:53.674 --> 59:55.508
No. It's... it's fine.

59:55.510 --> 59:57.610
I'm crazy about children.

59:57.612 --> 01:00:00.913
It's... one of the biggest
regrets of my life, actually.

01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:04.483
But you didn't come here

01:00:04.485 --> 01:00:07.019
to discuss my personal tragedies, so...

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:09.989
Tell me. How can I help you?

01:00:09.991 --> 01:00:12.825
I was hoping you could help
me revise my family's trust.

01:00:12.827 --> 01:00:14.026
Okay.

01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:15.628
My guardian passed away

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:18.097
and left my siblings and
me quite a bit of money,

01:00:18.099 --> 01:00:20.832
but my sister recently passed away.

01:00:22.567 --> 01:00:24.936
She was murdered, actually.

01:00:24.938 --> 01:00:26.838
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.674
Thank you.

01:00:29.676 --> 01:00:33.544
So, now it's just my brother and me.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:35.013
Oh.

01:00:35.015 --> 01:00:38.482
You're not married. I... I just assumed.

01:00:38.484 --> 01:00:40.451
My husband died in a car accident

01:00:40.453 --> 01:00:42.553
when I was pregnant with our son.

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:45.322
Sounds like you've been through
your own fair share of tragedy.

01:00:45.324 --> 01:00:47.891
My mother always said,
"if you cling to the past,

01:00:47.893 --> 01:00:49.592
you'll drown in a sea of tears."

01:00:49.594 --> 01:00:52.029
Well, she sounds like a very wise woman.

01:00:52.031 --> 01:00:54.965
Let's just say that
everything I know about pain

01:00:54.967 --> 01:00:56.199
I learned from her.

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:04.041
Christopher, being a doctor
is a tremendous privilege.

01:01:04.043 --> 01:01:06.143
People treat you like a God.

01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:08.511
But with that comes a
great deal of pressure.

01:01:08.513 --> 01:01:10.647
Now, I know that you've gone through

01:01:10.649 --> 01:01:12.649
some very tough times recently.

01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:14.017
And I've often said

01:01:14.019 --> 01:01:16.952
that what gets us through those tough times

01:01:16.954 --> 01:01:18.854
is the love of our family.

01:01:18.856 --> 01:01:23.159
You've been dating my
daughter for over a year now.

01:01:23.161 --> 01:01:26.361
Sarah is a very sweet girl, Christopher.

01:01:26.363 --> 01:01:29.631
She's always been the light of my life.

01:01:29.633 --> 01:01:33.169
If you're serious about her,
I would like nothing more

01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:36.205
than to welcome you
into our family as a son.

01:01:36.207 --> 01:01:40.743
But if you don't intend
to marry my daughter,

01:01:40.745 --> 01:01:43.378
you need to let her go.

01:01:46.016 --> 01:01:48.184
[Knock on door]

01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:57.125
Right on time.

01:01:57.127 --> 01:01:58.827
Oh.

01:01:58.829 --> 01:02:00.628
I wasn't expecting you.

01:02:02.231 --> 01:02:04.032
Is Christopher with you?

01:02:04.034 --> 01:02:06.935
He doesn't know I came up here to Virginia.

01:02:06.937 --> 01:02:08.870
Can I come in?

01:02:08.872 --> 01:02:10.404
Of course.

01:02:10.406 --> 01:02:14.575
Sorry. I'm just surprised you're here.

01:02:16.545 --> 01:02:18.646
I know this isn't my place,

01:02:18.648 --> 01:02:21.282
but I was hoping the two of
you could patch things up,

01:02:21.284 --> 01:02:23.584
whatever happened between you.

01:02:23.586 --> 01:02:25.919
I just know that Christopher
misses you very much.

01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:27.788
I've just been busy.

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:30.891
Cathy, I know that's not true.

01:02:30.893 --> 01:02:34.228
The fact is,

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.997
you're the most important
person in the world to him.

01:02:36.999 --> 01:02:39.800
And I know that Christopher
would just be heartbroken

01:02:39.802 --> 01:02:41.769
if you weren't part of our wedding.

01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:46.307
What?

01:02:47.876 --> 01:02:50.678
We're getting married
at the end of the year.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.182
And I was hoping that
you'd be my maid of honor.

01:02:56.918 --> 01:02:58.351
Of course.

01:02:58.353 --> 01:02:59.820
Oh.

01:03:01.222 --> 01:03:03.791
[Soft jazz music playing]

01:03:03.793 --> 01:03:07.094
Your wife won't miss you tonight?

01:03:07.096 --> 01:03:10.831
No. She's busy renovating the
entrance to her family's mansion

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:12.699
for about the 17th time now.

01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:16.136
Sounds like a huge project.

01:03:16.138 --> 01:03:19.673
It's hell, but it makes my wife happy.

01:03:19.675 --> 01:03:23.042
You must love her very much.

01:03:23.044 --> 01:03:26.413
Let's just say she keeps things lively.

01:03:26.415 --> 01:03:29.182
Never a dull moment with Corrine.

01:03:29.184 --> 01:03:32.919
Must be glamorous...

01:03:32.921 --> 01:03:38.692
fancy parties, exotic vacations.

01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:40.727
Want to know the truth?

01:03:42.429 --> 01:03:44.663
Sometimes, I fantasize about living

01:03:44.665 --> 01:03:47.666
in a tiny, little cottage
somewhere in suburbia.

01:03:49.869 --> 01:03:51.637
Picket fence, hamburgers on the grill,

01:03:51.639 --> 01:03:53.205
playing catch in the yard.

01:03:53.207 --> 01:03:55.874
That's so funny, because the
people that have that life

01:03:55.876 --> 01:03:58.711
are probably fantasizing
about trading places with you.

01:03:58.713 --> 01:04:01.913
The grass is always greener.

01:04:01.915 --> 01:04:04.950
I suppose it's hard to get through life

01:04:04.952 --> 01:04:07.353
without a few little regrets.

01:04:07.355 --> 01:04:11.189
Anything you say yes to...

01:04:11.191 --> 01:04:14.292
you're necessarily saying
no to something else.

01:04:14.294 --> 01:04:18.028
I hate the word "no."

01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:20.998
I much prefer...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.069
the sound of "yes."

01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:26.303
Yes.

01:04:26.305 --> 01:04:28.873

- Yes! Yes!
- [Grunting]

01:04:36.187 --> 01:04:37.854
I asked the contractor
for Robin's-egg blue,

01:04:37.856 --> 01:04:40.724
and he brought over
cornflower and periwinkle.

01:04:40.726 --> 01:04:41.858
The man is colorblind.

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.860
It's not Robin's egg.

01:04:43.862 --> 01:04:45.829
Well...

01:04:47.331 --> 01:04:50.565
This one matches your eyes.

01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:52.533
Do you want to come with
me to the house today?

01:04:52.535 --> 01:04:55.103
I'm meeting the contractor
over there later.

01:04:55.105 --> 01:04:57.505
These men think they can
ride roughshod over me.

01:05:00.894 --> 01:05:02.194
Uh, yeah.

01:05:02.196 --> 01:05:04.263
We're trying to hash out a settlement

01:05:04.265 --> 01:05:06.398
on this Josephson case, so...

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.532
Okay.

01:05:07.534 --> 01:05:09.500
I'll probably be home late.

that I'm not invited
to your Christmas party.

I don't want to hurt you.

01:11:09.749 --> 01:11:11.382
Believe or not,

01:11:11.384 --> 01:11:14.752
some people don't put money
before their own children.

01:11:15.721 --> 01:11:17.822
What are you talking about?

01:11:17.824 --> 01:11:20.424
I'm pregnant with Bart's child.

01:11:28.266 --> 01:11:30.600
[Sighs]

01:11:32.603 --> 01:11:34.338
Do you love him?

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.840
No.

01:11:39.477 --> 01:11:41.611
I love you.

01:11:43.948 --> 01:11:46.216
But I have to finish what I started.

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:56.860
You're not going alone.

01:11:56.862 --> 01:11:58.762
Christopher...

01:11:58.764 --> 01:12:01.631
I'm coming with you.

01:12:19.278 --> 01:12:21.146
<i>Corrine: [Echoing] Whatever you do,</i>

01:12:21.148 --> 01:12:23.114
<i>don't make your grandmother angry, okay?</i>

01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:28.821
<i>Olivia: Beautiful, prideful, and weak,</i>

01:12:28.823 --> 01:12:31.690
<i>just like your mother.</i>

01:12:34.994 --> 01:12:39.630
<i>God sees what you do behind my back.</i>

01:12:39.632 --> 01:12:44.336
<i>God sees everything.</i>

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:07.224
Olivia: Martha, is that you?

01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:13.631
Martha, I need you!

01:13:26.244 --> 01:13:28.412
I'm not Martha.

01:13:30.648 --> 01:13:33.350
I know who you are.

01:13:33.352 --> 01:13:36.686
What took you so long?

01:13:36.688 --> 01:13:40.524
All these years, I had
nightmares about you.

01:13:40.526 --> 01:13:42.726
Will you get my nurse for me?

01:13:42.728 --> 01:13:44.995
You're just a pathetic old hag.

01:13:46.731 --> 01:13:48.565
You can't hurt me anymore.

01:13:48.567 --> 01:13:50.935
You've always had a nasty mouth.

01:13:50.937 --> 01:13:52.970
The whole time we were in the attic,

01:13:52.972 --> 01:13:55.338
you talked about God and the Bible.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.241
Well, your mother spoiled
you. I was doing God's work.

01:13:58.243 --> 01:14:00.276
God doesn't starve children.
He doesn't beat them.

01:14:00.278 --> 01:14:01.577
That was you.

01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:03.546
You did that to us.

01:14:03.548 --> 01:14:06.382
And you made two years of
our lives a living hell.

01:14:06.384 --> 01:14:07.583
Two years?

01:14:07.585 --> 01:14:12.288
Try 60 years... in this God-forsaken house.

01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.524
- I'm the prisoner here!
- My brother died because of you.

01:14:15.526 --> 01:14:18.061
Well, he was filth. He
should never have been born.

01:14:18.063 --> 01:14:21.613
He was a little boy, and
he did not deserve that.

01:14:21.621 --> 01:14:23.188
And now Carrie's dead

01:14:23.190 --> 01:14:26.091
because of the lies that
you hammered into our heads.

01:14:26.093 --> 01:14:28.526
You said we were wicked.
And we were innocent.

01:14:28.528 --> 01:14:32.530
Innocent? You think I don't
know what went on in that attic?

01:14:34.433 --> 01:14:36.601
You spread your legs for your own brother.

01:14:36.603 --> 01:14:38.670
Don't you dare say another word.

01:14:38.672 --> 01:14:40.605
[Chuckling] Oh, you're gonna kill me?

01:14:40.607 --> 01:14:43.408
Do it! Do me a favor!

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:46.845
But even if you do, you'll
still have the Foxworth blood

01:14:46.847 --> 01:14:48.779
flowing through your veins.

01:14:48.781 --> 01:14:54.418
You'll always be what you
are... the devil's spawn.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.187
- Aah!
- [Glass shatters]

01:14:57.455 --> 01:15:02.426
I am not my mother, and I am not you!

01:15:02.428 --> 01:15:05.529
You can leave Foxworth Hall,

01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:09.901
but you can never escape this family.

01:15:16.974 --> 01:15:20.076
You sure you want to go through with this?

01:15:20.078 --> 01:15:22.112
She walled off the attic, Christopher.

01:15:22.114 --> 01:15:24.180
She made it look all shiny and pretty,

01:15:24.182 --> 01:15:26.650
like we were never there,
like it never happened.

01:15:26.652 --> 01:15:29.486
She can't get away with this.

01:15:29.488 --> 01:15:31.588
Not this time.

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:34.825
I brought you a dress
for the party tonight.

01:15:34.827 --> 01:15:37.661
I'm not going.

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:39.595
You might as well enjoy yourself,

01:15:39.597 --> 01:15:41.263
because I've made arrangements

01:15:41.265 --> 01:15:44.600
to check you in to a nursing home tomorrow.

01:15:44.602 --> 01:15:47.537
You can't make me go. I won't let you.

01:15:49.573 --> 01:15:54.677
I am through taking orders from you.

01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:56.579
I make the rules in this house now.

01:15:56.581 --> 01:16:00.683
You couldn't survive without me.

01:16:00.685 --> 01:16:02.284
You don't know what I could do.

01:16:02.286 --> 01:16:03.553
Oh, yes, I do.

01:16:03.555 --> 01:16:05.922
<i>I know exactly what you can do.</i>

01:16:05.924 --> 01:16:08.557
Nobody's interested in the
rantings of an old woman.

01:16:08.559 --> 01:16:12.361
I'm gonna take my rightful
place in this house tonight,

01:16:12.363 --> 01:16:14.596
and you'll be there to watch.

01:16:18.801 --> 01:16:22.504
Ready for your big night?

01:16:22.506 --> 01:16:24.739
Almost.

01:16:24.741 --> 01:16:26.942
Who was that on the phone earlier?

01:16:26.944 --> 01:16:30.545
Uh, just a nervous client.
Needed a little hand-holding.

01:16:37.954 --> 01:16:42.423
I know I've been neglecting you recently.

01:16:42.425 --> 01:16:46.895
I put this renovation ahead
of everything, including you.

01:16:46.897 --> 01:16:48.363
It's okay.

01:16:48.365 --> 01:16:49.830
No, it's not okay.

01:16:49.832 --> 01:16:53.467
From now on, I intend to give
you my undivided attention.

01:16:53.469 --> 01:16:54.702
Ahh, yes.

01:16:54.704 --> 01:16:56.604
Does this feel good?

01:16:56.606 --> 01:16:58.506
Yeah.

01:16:58.508 --> 01:17:00.340
I know you've been seeing someone else.

01:17:00.342 --> 01:17:01.842
I don't want to know who it is.

01:17:01.844 --> 01:17:03.744
I don't want to know anything about her.

01:17:03.746 --> 01:17:05.813
I just want you to end it.

01:17:05.815 --> 01:17:08.248
After tonight, we'll put
all our sins in the past

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:11.852
and we'll never speak of this ever again.

01:17:25.065 --> 01:17:26.833
Corrine: I went through three contractors

01:17:26.835 --> 01:17:28.801
before I found one who
could finish the job.

01:17:28.803 --> 01:17:31.037
Well, it looks even more spectacular...

01:17:31.039 --> 01:17:32.705
and I'm not talking about the house.

01:17:32.707 --> 01:17:34.407
You're so kind.

01:17:34.489 --> 01:17:35.889
It's true, darling.

01:17:35.891 --> 01:17:38.591
You look especially radiant tonight.

01:17:38.593 --> 01:17:40.559
[Chuckles]

01:17:40.561 --> 01:17:43.862
Well, I'd say dragging this
house out of the dark ages

01:17:43.864 --> 01:17:46.197
has done wonders for my disposition.

01:17:48.468 --> 01:17:49.902
Mother.

01:17:49.904 --> 01:17:53.839
If you'll excuse me, it's
almost time for the toast.

01:17:55.909 --> 01:17:58.877
It was in this house at
this very party 12 years ago

01:17:58.879 --> 01:18:01.146
when I first fell in love with Corrine.

01:18:01.148 --> 01:18:04.482
Aww! I was a baby plucked from my cradle.

01:18:04.484 --> 01:18:07.419
Funny. I thought it was a swan bed.

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:08.886
Bart, my mother is here.

01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:10.322
[Laughter]

01:18:10.324 --> 01:18:12.424
So, tonight, in this season of miracles,

01:18:12.426 --> 01:18:15.226
I want to raise a glass
to Foxworth Hall reborn

01:18:15.228 --> 01:18:17.228
and to my dazzling wife, Corrine,

01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:19.764
who always keeps things exciting and new.

01:18:19.766 --> 01:18:21.298
To Corrine.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.433
All: To Corrine.

01:18:22.435 --> 01:18:23.968
[Glasses clinking]

01:18:26.939 --> 01:18:28.673
All: Aww.

01:18:28.675 --> 01:18:33.644
Cathy: I would also like
to raise a toast to Corrine.

01:18:33.646 --> 01:18:36.614
I was also at the Foxworth
Christmas party 12 years ago.

01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:40.351
See, my brothers and sister
and I lived in the attic,

01:18:40.353 --> 01:18:42.319
locked up by our grandmother...

01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:45.789
kept hidden away like a dirty little secret

01:18:45.791 --> 01:18:51.228
by your dazzling hostess, our mother.

01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:53.430
I see that you're shocked to learn

01:18:53.432 --> 01:18:55.466
Corrine actually has children.

01:18:55.468 --> 01:18:57.167
<i>- She's lying.
- Had children,</i>

01:18:57.169 --> 01:18:58.835
in the case of my two younger siblings.

01:18:58.837 --> 01:19:00.604
She poisoned Corey.

01:19:00.606 --> 01:19:02.205
Why are you even listening to her?

01:19:02.207 --> 01:19:04.440
Mother, tell them it's not true.

01:19:04.442 --> 01:19:05.774
Oh, Corrine, dear,

01:19:05.776 --> 01:19:08.478
I don't think anyone is interested

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.914
in the rantings of an old woman.

01:19:11.916 --> 01:19:13.383
This is insane.

01:19:13.385 --> 01:19:15.284
Bart, get these people out of the house.

01:19:15.286 --> 01:19:17.420
- She's your daughter?
- No.

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.523
Don't lie to me.

01:19:20.525 --> 01:19:22.791
Tell him, Corrine, or I will.

01:19:22.793 --> 01:19:24.293
I wanted to help them.

01:19:24.295 --> 01:19:26.862
No, you were trying to kill them.

01:19:26.864 --> 01:19:28.497
- Shut up!
- [Crowd gasping]

01:19:28.499 --> 01:19:29.632
I needed an excuse to get them out.

01:19:29.634 --> 01:19:31.099
Oh, my God.

01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:33.468
You know my father. He was so hard on me.

01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:35.871
He never would have accepted me. He
would have written me out of his will.

01:19:35.873 --> 01:19:37.740
Don't look at me that way. I'm your wife.

01:19:37.742 --> 01:19:38.841
She's nothing to you.

01:19:38.843 --> 01:19:41.410
Cathy: That's not true, either.

01:19:41.412 --> 01:19:43.746
I'm pregnant with his child.

01:19:43.748 --> 01:19:46.614
What?

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:49.851
[Crowd whispering and murmuring]

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.721
Merry Christmas, mother.

01:19:59.012 --> 01:20:01.146
You are just as crazy as that
witch of a mother of yours.

01:20:01.148 --> 01:20:04.984
You point the finger at
me, but you slept with her.

01:20:04.986 --> 01:20:07.286
You slept with my daughter

01:20:07.288 --> 01:20:10.289
and then you came home
and pretended to love me!

01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:11.691
All of you, out.

01:20:11.693 --> 01:20:13.559
I want everyone out of this house!

01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:16.896
I want everyone out!

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:20.031
She's always hated me.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:22.968
[Door closes]

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:26.393
It's the devil's spawn.
Tell her to get rid of it.

01:20:26.398 --> 01:20:28.432
- What?
- You have to.

01:20:28.434 --> 01:20:31.068
I can't even look at you right now.

01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:33.671
You need to give me time to think.

01:20:41.245 --> 01:20:43.580
I'd like a moment alone with Cathy.

01:20:45.183 --> 01:20:47.217
It's okay.

01:20:55.126 --> 01:20:58.195
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

01:20:58.197 --> 01:21:00.464
For what?

01:21:00.466 --> 01:21:02.299
Lying to me?

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.568
Seducing me to get even with your mother?

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:10.439
I did what I did for reasons
you couldn't possibly understand.

01:21:10.441 --> 01:21:12.574
No, I understand.

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:15.211
You wanted to hurt my wife.

01:21:15.213 --> 01:21:17.113
I did, but I didn't realize...

01:21:17.115 --> 01:21:20.182
No. No, you didn't realize.

01:21:20.204 --> 01:21:22.104
I know that you don't believe it,

01:21:22.106 --> 01:21:23.339
but I do care about you.

01:21:24.908 --> 01:21:27.576
This isn't just our lives anymore.

01:21:29.512 --> 01:21:31.847
Get out.

01:21:36.352 --> 01:21:40.589
So, the chickens have
come home to roost, huh?

01:21:40.591 --> 01:21:43.024
This is your fault, all of it.

01:21:43.026 --> 01:21:48.397
"Those who sow the seeds of evil
shall reap the harvest in hell."

01:21:48.409 --> 01:21:50.476
You made me put them in the attic.

01:21:50.478 --> 01:21:52.378
You said that it was the only way.

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:55.714
They're an abomination
in the eyes of the lord.

01:21:55.716 --> 01:21:57.515
They were my children.

01:21:57.517 --> 01:22:02.154
Everything that I ever
loved you took from me.

01:22:02.156 --> 01:22:05.690
They never should have been born,

01:22:05.692 --> 01:22:07.993
you stupid, sinful girl.

01:22:09.829 --> 01:22:11.997
Why couldn't you love me?

01:22:11.999 --> 01:22:15.066
[Sighs]

01:22:15.068 --> 01:22:18.436
I love you.

01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:22.106
I... I even have a present for you.

01:22:24.142 --> 01:22:25.176
It's in the trunk.

01:22:25.178 --> 01:22:27.745
A little surprise.

01:22:27.747 --> 01:22:29.347
Open it.

01:22:29.349 --> 01:22:31.416
What did you do?

01:22:31.418 --> 01:22:35.920
I had your workmen go up to the attic

01:22:35.922 --> 01:22:40.758
and bring down some of
your precious souvenirs.

01:22:58.243 --> 01:23:00.344
My poor baby.

01:23:00.346 --> 01:23:02.980
[Sobbing]

01:23:04.449 --> 01:23:05.782
Mother?

01:23:17.228 --> 01:23:18.695
It's gonna be okay.

01:23:18.697 --> 01:23:19.295
Don't listen to what the others are saying.

01:23:19.297 --> 01:23:21.097
We can start over.

01:23:21.099 --> 01:23:25.134
We can go north to Pennsylvania.
No one will know us there.

01:23:25.136 --> 01:23:26.236
What are you talking about?

01:23:26.238 --> 01:23:28.070
It kicked.

01:23:28.072 --> 01:23:29.137
[Gasps]

01:23:29.139 --> 01:23:30.573
If it's a boy,

01:23:30.575 --> 01:23:32.074
we'll name him Christopher, after you.

01:23:34.277 --> 01:23:36.412
[Laughs] Don't look at me.

01:23:36.414 --> 01:23:41.083
We could start a family,
just like we always dreamed.

01:23:41.085 --> 01:23:42.418
What are you doing?!

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:47.956
Don't you love me?

01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:51.260
[Laughs]

01:23:58.801 --> 01:24:01.103
We need to hide the body in the attic.

01:24:01.105 --> 01:24:03.838
No one will find him there.

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.910
Corey.

01:24:08.912 --> 01:24:10.344
He's in a better place now,

01:24:10.346 --> 01:24:12.246
but we must never speak of it again.

01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:14.548
You didn't even bury him.

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:20.988
I'm sorry, Corey. I'm so sorry.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.092
[Whimpers]

01:24:25.094 --> 01:24:26.327
What...

01:24:26.329 --> 01:24:27.962
[fire crackling]

01:24:27.964 --> 01:24:31.298
Are you crazy?

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.432
What are you doing?

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.467
Goodbye, mother.

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:36.436
No.

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:38.939
No!

01:24:38.941 --> 01:24:40.540
Help!

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:43.143
[Screaming]

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.048
Cathy, get out! There's a fire!

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.149
What?

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:51.250
Bart, no.

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:52.818
Help!

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:54.920
I'm not gonna just let her burn.

01:24:54.922 --> 01:24:57.022
[Screaming continues]

01:24:57.024 --> 01:25:00.192
[Bart shouting]

01:25:00.194 --> 01:25:01.927
What have I done?

01:25:01.929 --> 01:25:03.495
[Glass shattering]

01:25:03.497 --> 01:25:05.197
Cathy! Come on.

01:25:05.199 --> 01:25:08.067
We got to go. We got to go.

01:25:17.242 --> 01:25:20.211
[Glass shattering]

01:25:20.213 --> 01:25:22.580
[Creaking]

01:25:35.394 --> 01:25:37.528
[Children shouting]

01:25:44.035 --> 01:25:47.237
Don't even get me started on my in-laws.

01:25:47.239 --> 01:25:49.906
I hate to break up the
party, but dessert's ready.

01:25:53.411 --> 01:25:55.312
It looks delicious.

01:25:56.947 --> 01:26:01.317
I made your dad's favorite
homemade apple pie.

01:26:01.319 --> 01:26:02.552
Looks wonderful, honey.

01:26:02.554 --> 01:26:04.020
Sure does, mom.

01:26:04.022 --> 01:26:06.055
What's your secret, anyway?

01:26:06.057 --> 01:26:08.925
You Dollangangers are always so perfect.

01:26:14.398 --> 01:26:16.065
Well, who's hungry?

01:26:16.067 --> 01:26:17.400
Me! Me!

01:26:23.273 --> 01:26:24.573
I'm nothing... I'm nothing like my mother.

01:26:24.575 --> 01:26:26.275
I'm nothing like her at all.

01:26:26.277 --> 01:26:27.576
I'm gonna stand up to my mother

01:26:27.578 --> 01:26:29.478
and tell her that I'm getting them out.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.746
And I don't care what she says

01:26:30.748 --> 01:26:32.448
and I don't care what my father says.

01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:34.450
And they're locked in the
room, and I just need the key.

01:26:34.452 --> 01:26:35.617
I just need the key.

01:26:35.619 --> 01:26:38.120
Why won't you let me see them?!

01:26:38.122 --> 01:26:39.455
Mother!

01:26:39.457 --> 01:26:41.457
I need to see my babies!

01:26:41.459 --> 01:26:43.258
[Sobbing]

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:45.193
My babies need me!

01:26:45.195 --> 01:26:47.762
I need to see my babies!

01:26:49.565 --> 01:26:52.100
I'm nothing like my mother.

01:26:52.102 --> 01:26:54.569
I'll show them I'm nothing like my mother.

01:26:54.571 --> 01:26:56.271
I'm nothing like my mother.

01:26:56.273 --> 01:26:58.106
I need to see my babies. I love my babies.
