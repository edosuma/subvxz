01:42.000 --> 01:46.199
Let me show you what is marked
as States Exhibit 72,

01:46.200 --> 01:49.480
and ask whether you can
identify that for me, please?

01:50.640 --> 01:53.799
This is my blow poke.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.239
You blow through it.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.679
OK. And...

01:57.680 --> 02:02.399
did you also purchase others
that were similar to it? Yes, I did.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.999
In Christmas of 1984,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.758
I so enjoyed having my blow poke,

02:09.759 --> 02:12.399
it was so useful and handy,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.479
I decided to give
it to family members,

02:14.480 --> 02:16.759
and I gave one to my brother,

02:16.760 --> 02:18.799
I gave to my sister Kathleen,

02:18.800 --> 02:22.119
and I also gave one to my mother.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.839
And, with respect
to each of those items,

02:24.840 --> 02:28.199
was it identical to what is marked
here as States Exhibit 72?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.519
Yes, they were.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.319
With respect to this item,
did you have the occasion to see it

02:34.320 --> 02:37.440
in her home at various times
when you visited?

02:38.600 --> 02:42.400
Yes, I saw it in every home she
lived in whenever I visited. OK.

02:59.799 --> 03:05.718
Now, Miss Zamperini, did you ever
say to the police that you

03:05.719 --> 03:10.878
only saw the relationship between
Michael and Kathleen as being

03:10.879 --> 03:15.238
a "truly, loving,
respectful marriage"?

03:15.239 --> 03:21.878
I wrote that in a statement,
dated January 10th.

03:21.879 --> 03:25.558
At that time I felt that.
I no longer do.

03:25.559 --> 03:30.598
But you did state that the only
relationship you saw between

03:30.599 --> 03:35.878
Michael and Kathleen was as a
"truly loving, respectful marriage".

03:35.879 --> 03:38.158
Right? Those were your words.

03:38.159 --> 03:40.718
They weren't my words,
it's what I wrote.

03:40.719 --> 03:43.439
I didn't verbalise it,
if that's what you are getting at.

03:44.759 --> 03:48.038
Well, they are your words
in your statement.

03:48.039 --> 03:51.758
At that moment in time,
that's what I wrote.

03:51.759 --> 03:54.878
That's all I have, thank you ma'am.

03:54.879 --> 04:00.638
Mr Rudolf asked you whether,
at some point, you had

04:00.639 --> 04:03.798
indicated to police that
Michael and Kathleen

04:03.799 --> 04:07.439
had a "truly loving
and respectful relationship".

04:08.679 --> 04:10.558
At that time I felt that way.

04:10.559 --> 04:13.918
I was not aware of all the other
secrets that came out later,

04:13.919 --> 04:15.278
not at all. So...

04:15.279 --> 04:18.039
I object to that, Your Honour.
Overruled.

04:19.039 --> 04:22.398
When I wrote that statement barely
a month after my sister's death,

04:22.399 --> 04:26.318
I was totally unaware of
private aspects of his life.

04:26.319 --> 04:27.719
I had no idea.

04:28.919 --> 04:32.878
Do you still feel that way?
That there was a "truly, loving,

04:32.879 --> 04:35.319
"respectful relationship"
between them?

04:36.839 --> 04:41.118
Sitting here today, I have
no idea who Michael Peterson is.

04:41.119 --> 04:44.079
None whatsoever.
He is who he held himself out to be.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.719
And who he has turned out to be.
No, I have no idea who he is.

05:01.839 --> 05:04.119
'10.17am.'

05:06.398 --> 05:10.317
'Hello, Mr Rudolf.
This is Brent Wolgamott.

05:10.318 --> 05:14.157
'I'm the alleged male escort
that is being talked about

05:14.158 --> 05:16.557
'the last couple of days
in the papers and on TV.

05:16.558 --> 05:20.917
'If you could give
me a call back to talk to me, OK.

05:20.918 --> 05:23.397
'Believe me, I am on nobody's side.

05:23.398 --> 05:25.917
'I'm not on the prosecution's side,
I'm not...

05:25.918 --> 05:29.077
'I'm trying to stay out of it.
Call me back please. Bye.'

05:29.078 --> 05:30.598
'End of message.'

05:32.798 --> 05:35.597
Hello, Michael, how are you?
'OK, Sir.'

05:35.598 --> 05:40.558
So, yesterday morning I went to
Raleigh and met with Brad.

05:41.798 --> 05:43.197
'Brad? Oh, Brad! OK.'

05:43.198 --> 05:45.917
Soldier top. 'Yes.' Yes. 'OK.'

05:45.918 --> 05:49.157
Brad is very freaked out.

05:49.158 --> 05:51.117
'I bet to hell he is.'

05:51.118 --> 05:53.677
What he's hoping is that
we can convince...

05:53.678 --> 05:56.437
He wants us to try to convince
the DA not to call him.

05:56.438 --> 05:58.277
I said that's unlikely,

05:58.278 --> 06:03.557
but it may be that the judge
will find that it's not relevant,

06:03.558 --> 06:07.317
and I think, you know, he's not
going to hurt us in any way.

06:07.318 --> 06:11.757
The other issue is that other
e-mail exchange in late November.

06:11.758 --> 06:14.157
You know which
one I'm talking about?

06:14.158 --> 06:18.277
'I would really have to go back
and refresh my memory.' OK.

06:18.278 --> 06:21.357
'I've never met that guy.'
That's... I just want to make sure.

06:21.358 --> 06:26.717
'Absolutely not.' OK. 'Absolutely
100% not. No, no.' OK. 'No, no, no.'

06:26.718 --> 06:29.797
OK, so whatever e-mail exchange
there was in November did not

06:29.798 --> 06:34.277
lead to any kind of personal
meeting. 'No, absolutely not.' OK.

06:34.278 --> 06:37.197
I mean, you understand that if it
happened and I know about it,

06:37.198 --> 06:39.237
I can deal with it.

06:39.238 --> 06:41.637
'I haven't lied to you
about one single thing

06:41.638 --> 06:45.157
'because I know you get blindsided
and it would just destroy me,

06:45.158 --> 06:48.077
'and I'm not going to take that
risk. I want you to know that.'

06:48.078 --> 06:52.517
I think I know that. OK. I mean,
I'm just asking the question.

06:52.518 --> 06:54.557
'I understand that.

06:54.558 --> 06:57.037
'I think I've been honest
with you from day one,

06:57.038 --> 06:58.557
'since you met me in the jail.'

06:58.558 --> 07:01.277
I didn't meet you in the jail,
I met you before you went to jail.

07:01.278 --> 07:03.997
'Well, I mean...
Right, that's correct.

07:03.998 --> 07:07.117
'You didn't keep me out of jail,
by the way!' Right, that's right.

07:07.118 --> 07:08.437
I'm sorry, Michael.

07:08.438 --> 07:11.317
I'm not even that concerned
with the bisexuality

07:11.318 --> 07:13.838
as a general proposition.

07:15.078 --> 07:19.957
What I'm concerned about are some
of the e-mails that are just...

07:19.958 --> 07:24.517
They are going to turn
people off to Mike.

07:26.437 --> 07:29.036
They are completely
irrelevant to the case,

07:29.037 --> 07:32.596
but they are not irrelevant
to who Mike is,

07:32.597 --> 07:35.076
and whether a jury's going to be

07:35.077 --> 07:37.757
willing to believe
the worst about him.

07:42.437 --> 07:45.316
I would very much like
to keep this stuff out.

07:45.317 --> 07:48.556
It seems to me that this is really
going to tank some of the jurors'

07:48.557 --> 07:51.876
views of Mike,
so the question really is,

07:51.877 --> 07:56.756
what increases the likelihood
of winning the motion?

07:56.757 --> 08:00.516
Well, clearly there's
a distinction between the Vive guys

08:00.517 --> 08:02.596
from 11 years ago and the e-mail.

08:02.597 --> 08:05.636
There are distinctions, and I
think we can make that distinction.

08:05.637 --> 08:08.596
The easy argument that people had
sex with him before his marriage

08:08.597 --> 08:10.276
is just totally irrelevant. Right.

08:10.277 --> 08:11.836
We don't need to spend time on that.

08:11.837 --> 08:14.997
If those were women,
it would be laughable. That...

08:16.157 --> 08:21.476
The pornography and the, you know,
fantasy or escort stuff,

08:21.477 --> 08:24.356
isn't really related to infidelity.

08:24.357 --> 08:28.756
Yes, and I think your argument about
sort of taking out the gay stuff

08:28.757 --> 08:32.556
and making it heterosexual,
is exactly right.

08:32.557 --> 08:35.956
Yes, if they're smart
they do a couple of things.

08:35.957 --> 08:39.596
One is they say,
"Well, in assessing the motive,

08:39.597 --> 08:43.116
"you assess how much he loves her."
I mean, somebody...

08:43.116 --> 08:44.876
A motive is more believable

08:44.877 --> 08:48.436
if you aren't that committed
to your wife, than if you are.

08:48.437 --> 08:51.076
OK, but these e-mails
don't show lack of commitment.

08:51.077 --> 08:52.836
I think their positions...

08:52.837 --> 08:57.036
Devil's advocate is, anybody who
is willing to spend money for sex

08:57.037 --> 08:59.596
you know, during their marriage,

08:59.597 --> 09:03.396
a jury could decide that shows a
lack of commitment to the marriage.

09:03.397 --> 09:07.436
So you're telling me that if a man
contacts a prostitute,

09:07.437 --> 09:11.356
never has sex with her,
just contemplates it,

09:11.357 --> 09:14.356
that that indicates a lack
of commitment to the marriage?

09:14.357 --> 09:17.956
I think a judge could find that
a jury could make that conclusion.

09:17.957 --> 09:21.557
Such a lack of commitment that
it's relevant to a murder charge?

09:26.277 --> 09:29.076
If one were to think about this,
if those were women,

09:29.077 --> 09:33.476
if Mr Peterson's only sexual
orientation was heterosexual,

09:33.477 --> 09:36.835
and the state had located
two prior girlfriends that he had

09:36.836 --> 09:40.275
had some physical relationship
with before his marriage,

09:40.276 --> 09:43.315
I don't think any court
would think there's any relevance.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.115
It would be ridiculous to suggest
that that somehow reflects

09:46.116 --> 09:48.875
upon the state of your marriage
to the extent that it would be

09:48.876 --> 09:52.435
relevant to whether you would
commit a murder years later.

09:52.436 --> 09:54.995
So, the only question then,

09:54.996 --> 09:59.875
is whether adding the layer
that this was sex with other men

09:59.876 --> 10:02.755
somehow increases the relevance
to the point

10:02.756 --> 10:06.235
that this court should allow
a jury to hear that testimony.

10:06.236 --> 10:10.075
I think it's clear that adding
the layer of sexual orientation

10:10.076 --> 10:13.275
decreases its admissibility,
as opposed to increasing it,

10:13.276 --> 10:16.995
because if even only one juror
starts looking at Mr Peterson

10:16.996 --> 10:19.595
differently, not because
they think there is a connection

10:19.596 --> 10:21.115
to what happened to Kathleen,

10:21.116 --> 10:23.395
but they look at him and say,
"God, this guy's gay!"

10:23.396 --> 10:25.355
If even one juror does that,

10:25.356 --> 10:28.035
Mr Peterson has been denied
a fair trial.

10:28.036 --> 10:31.115
Obviously there are two main grounds
where all these items,

10:31.116 --> 10:33.555
or most of these items are relevant,
obviously.

10:33.556 --> 10:35.195
Number one it goes to motive.

10:35.196 --> 10:38.395
It does go to motive, as to why
this act may have been committed.

10:38.396 --> 10:41.555
And number two, it goes specifically
to rebut some issues that

10:41.556 --> 10:44.035
were raised in the defendant's
opening statement,

10:44.036 --> 10:48.035
information about the idyllic
relationship that this couple had.

10:48.036 --> 10:50.875
Well, this does not jive
with that kind of statement.

10:50.876 --> 10:52.355
Why doesn't it jive?

10:52.356 --> 10:55.475
If it's an idyllic relationship,
then why is he e-mailing

10:55.476 --> 10:59.355
somebody else to meet for sexual
relations outside marriage?

10:59.356 --> 11:02.435
You know, you're talking about
a potential love triangle type

11:02.436 --> 11:05.515
of thing here, and clearly,
that's a motive for murder.

11:05.516 --> 11:08.515
If it's not a motive for murder,
then the entire soap industry dies

11:08.516 --> 11:12.675
because that's what they base
all their stories on. Um...

11:12.676 --> 11:14.275
That'd be OK! Yeah!

11:14.276 --> 11:19.035
You're talking specifically about
e-mails with a person that

11:19.036 --> 11:22.195
has been identified as Brad.
Is that correct? Yes, sir.

11:22.196 --> 11:24.715
Now, Mr Maher says

11:24.716 --> 11:29.675
there's no evidence that they had
relations or that they actually met.

11:29.676 --> 11:31.555
I don't see anywhere in the law,

11:31.556 --> 11:33.755
either in the rules
or in the case law

11:33.756 --> 11:37.035
that says they actually had to meet
for this to be a motive for murder.

11:37.036 --> 11:41.475
The bottom line is, he is looking
for this outside the marriage.

11:41.476 --> 11:43.675
All this stuff is on that computer.

11:43.676 --> 11:47.515
She could easily have found out
that night what was going on.

11:47.516 --> 11:49.796
Clearly, I think a motive
for murder.

11:51.475 --> 11:55.395
All right, counsel. Mr Maher, I
agree with the States presentation.

11:56.675 --> 12:01.474
The court is going to find that this
evidence proffered by the state

12:01.475 --> 12:03.234
is relevant.

12:03.235 --> 12:05.394
It goes to the issue of motive,

12:05.395 --> 12:08.954
and it also goes to attack
the idyllic marriage

12:08.955 --> 12:13.154
that the defendant has set forth
though his counsel

12:13.155 --> 12:15.075
in his opening statement.

12:22.155 --> 12:26.194
State your name, please. Brent
Wolgamott. How old are you, sir?

12:26.195 --> 12:30.754
I'm 28, ma'am. All right. Tell us,
back in 2001, where were you living?

12:30.755 --> 12:34.274
I was living in Fayetteville,
North Carolina. Doing what?

12:34.275 --> 12:38.034
I was an active duty soldier
in the United States Army.

12:38.035 --> 12:39.514
I did live off post though.

12:39.515 --> 12:44.514
During this time period back
in 2001, did you have a website?

12:44.515 --> 12:47.834
My image and information about
me was on a website, yes.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.714
A website, all right. And what was
the purpose of that website?

12:50.715 --> 12:53.354
It was a male for male
escort review site. OK.

12:53.355 --> 12:57.314
Tell us, please, when you say
a "male for male escort site",

12:57.315 --> 12:59.714
what types of services
did you perform?

12:59.715 --> 13:04.234
Basically it's companionship
for other males of legal age.

13:04.235 --> 13:05.714
All right.

13:05.715 --> 13:10.554
And did that involve sexual
activities? Sometimes it does. OK.

13:10.555 --> 13:12.194
What types
of sexual activities, sir?

13:12.195 --> 13:14.234
Oh, just about anything
under the sun.

13:14.235 --> 13:17.554
I mean, I didn't know how much
exactly the court wants

13:17.555 --> 13:20.074
me to go into detail, but...

13:20.075 --> 13:24.074
The court just wants you to answer
the questions. That's my answer.

13:24.075 --> 13:26.594
Just about anything under the sun?
Yes, ma'am. OK.

13:26.595 --> 13:28.554
Safely. Safely, I might add.

13:28.555 --> 13:31.674
Now, do you remember
when you were contacted

13:31.675 --> 13:35.434
by a person with the name MP Ryder?
Yes, ma'am.

13:35.435 --> 13:37.434
Approximately when would
that have been?

13:37.435 --> 13:38.994
I believe it was in August 2001.

13:38.995 --> 13:41.674
Did you discuss anything,

13:41.675 --> 13:44.234
other than just trying
to get to know each other?

13:44.235 --> 13:46.834
It was basically the same as many
other clients who contact me.

13:46.835 --> 13:48.154
They want to be safe,

13:48.155 --> 13:51.594
so they want to get to know
me to make sure I'm a... straight...

13:51.595 --> 13:54.434
A "straight" guy.
OK, what does that mean?

13:54.435 --> 13:57.594
Well, I'm not a gangster,
somebody who's going to rob them.

13:57.595 --> 13:59.434
I'm a clean cut professional

13:59.435 --> 14:02.274
who they're going
to have a good time with.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.754
Look at 170a.

14:04.755 --> 14:06.353
Do you recognise that?

14:06.354 --> 14:08.513
Yes, I'm the man in the middle. OK.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.753
And do you know how this photograph
might have come into

14:11.754 --> 14:14.073
Mr Peterson's possession?

14:14.074 --> 14:15.833
I would have had to send it to him.
OK.

14:15.834 --> 14:19.553
During the course of your
conversations with Mr Peterson,

14:19.554 --> 14:21.833
whether it be by phone
or by computer,

14:21.834 --> 14:24.993
did he ever mention his wife?

14:24.994 --> 14:26.633
I believe he did, yes, ma'am.

14:26.634 --> 14:30.033
Right now, did you have any type
of communication about how it

14:30.034 --> 14:33.833
was you were going to hook up
together without his wife knowing?

14:33.834 --> 14:36.953
I object to that. Or whether
his wife would know? Overruled.

14:36.954 --> 14:39.833
I don't remember any discussions
about whether his wife would

14:39.834 --> 14:41.193
or would not know.

14:41.194 --> 14:43.673
It may have been in e-mails,
but I do not recall that.

14:43.674 --> 14:47.073
We were to hook up, I believe,
on September 5, 2001.

14:47.074 --> 14:53.873
Tell us, please, did you actually
discuss what you were going to do

14:53.874 --> 14:58.033
when you were to get together
on September 5th, 2001? Yes, ma'am.

14:58.034 --> 15:00.793
And what were y'all planning
on doing? Having sex.

15:00.794 --> 15:03.193
What type of sex, sir? Do you know?

15:03.194 --> 15:06.073
Can I say it, I guess. Anal sex.

15:06.074 --> 15:09.993
Did you get together with him on
September 5, 2001? No, ma'am.

15:09.994 --> 15:11.233
Well, what happened?

15:11.234 --> 15:13.793
The only reason I was coming up
to Durham was because I was

15:13.794 --> 15:16.913
leaving on a flight the next morning
to Palm Springs, on September 6th.

15:16.914 --> 15:20.433
I'd had a very long day and when
I got up there that night,

15:20.434 --> 15:23.273
I just said, you know what?
I'll talk to him when I come back.

15:23.274 --> 15:25.993
I'm just tired and I want to go
to Palm Springs so I didn't go.

15:25.994 --> 15:29.153
Was that an unusual occurrence
for you to have,

15:29.154 --> 15:33.393
or plan to have sexual relations
with married men? To the contrary.

15:33.394 --> 15:36.433
Married men are in the majority
of most of the clients that I saw

15:36.434 --> 15:37.793
when I was a escort.

15:37.794 --> 15:41.393
With regard to the kind of man
that you tended to have escort

15:41.394 --> 15:43.873
relationships with,

15:43.874 --> 15:48.033
can you give us some indication
of their professions, for example?

15:48.034 --> 15:49.513
Sure.

15:49.514 --> 15:52.953
Usually they are professionals
because my fees were quite high.

15:52.954 --> 15:55.314
I saw doctors, attorneys...

15:57.074 --> 15:58.393
One judge.

15:58.394 --> 16:01.394
LAUGHTER

16:05.074 --> 16:06.874
It was not this judge.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.954
I think we can stipulate to that.

16:17.234 --> 16:20.193
Is...? Is it...?

16:20.194 --> 16:26.432
Is it fair to say that the men
who you would see were bisexual

16:26.433 --> 16:28.952
as opposed to being homosexual?

16:28.953 --> 16:32.912
In my opinion, I would go so far
as to even say

16:32.913 --> 16:34.872
that they were
predominantly straight,

16:34.873 --> 16:37.272
with minor homosexual tendencies.

16:37.273 --> 16:40.832
All right. And did a number
of the married men

16:40.833 --> 16:42.752
who you had sexual relations with

16:42.753 --> 16:45.712
have wives who knew
they were bisexual?

16:45.713 --> 16:48.232
Most of them did,
from my experience.

16:48.233 --> 16:50.832
In your experience,
was it unusual for a wife

16:50.833 --> 16:54.032
married to a bisexual man
to know that he was bisexual?

16:54.033 --> 16:58.552
Not at all. Did Michael Peterson
ever do or say anything,

16:58.553 --> 17:00.752
either on the phone or in an e-mail,

17:00.753 --> 17:04.872
that indicated he was not in love
with Kathleen Peterson?

17:04.873 --> 17:07.352
To the contrary - in his e-mails,
unlike most of my clients,

17:07.353 --> 17:09.271
he indicated that he had
a great relationship.

17:09.272 --> 17:11.912
Most clients don't want to say
anything about their relationship.

17:11.913 --> 17:14.031
He indicated he had
a warm relationship with his wife

17:14.032 --> 17:15.832
and nothing would ever destroy that.

17:15.833 --> 17:21.832
Sir, do you know anything about
the death of Kathleen Peterson?

17:21.833 --> 17:25.353
I know diddly. Diddly.

17:26.873 --> 17:29.992
"Brad, we talked on the phone
yesterday and I checked out

17:29.993 --> 17:31.832
"the website you gave me."

17:31.833 --> 17:33.752
"I would like to get together
with you.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.272
"Daytime is best for me.
I was in the Marines."

17:36.273 --> 17:39.392
"Love to fuck, never been fucked,
and not sure I'm interested.

17:39.393 --> 17:42.992
"I've never done escort, but used
to pay to fuck a super-macho guy

17:42.993 --> 17:44.752
"who played lacrosse at NC State."

17:44.753 --> 17:47.872
"Mike, I really enjoyed your e-mail.

17:47.873 --> 17:49.992
"You sound very cool, and it's rare

17:49.993 --> 17:53.032
"that I find a client
who wants..."

17:53.033 --> 17:56.152
"Brad, obviously,
I'm not looking for a relationship,

17:56.153 --> 17:58.472
"and neither are you."

17:58.473 --> 18:01.592
"Mike, I am coming up there
Wednesday night,

18:01.593 --> 18:04.432
"because I have to be on
a plane at 6am.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.872
"You got a big dick, guy?
Just wondering."

18:06.873 --> 18:10.392
"Brad, evenings are not great
for me, anyway.

18:10.393 --> 18:14.072
"I'm married, very happily married,
with a dynamite wife.

18:14.073 --> 18:18.392
"Yes, I know, I know. I'm very bi,
and that's all there is to it."

18:18.393 --> 18:21.992
'The question about the bisexuality,
I don't know,

18:21.993 --> 18:24.632
'is that probative
or is that inflammatory?

18:24.633 --> 18:27.592
'I tend to think the jury is
going to look at that...'

18:27.593 --> 18:30.272
'Yeah, I think that what it does
is show the jury'

18:30.273 --> 18:31.872
this was not a happy marriage -

18:31.873 --> 18:34.912
in fact, it was far from
a happy marriage,

18:34.913 --> 18:38.551
when you're attempting to pay
for sex with a hooker.

18:38.552 --> 18:43.471
'So, this idyllic relationship
that Mr Rudolf portrayed

18:43.472 --> 18:46.391
'is simply not true.'

18:46.392 --> 18:49.831
But the good thing about
how disgusting the media is

18:49.832 --> 18:51.871
is that when it's over, it's over.

18:51.872 --> 18:54.951
Nobody cares.
There is a new story, yeah.

18:54.952 --> 18:57.471
Yeah, there's a new story,
nobody cares any more.

18:57.472 --> 18:58.951
New lies. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

18:58.952 --> 19:02.471
I could commit a crime
and take the attention off you guys.

19:02.472 --> 19:05.871
"Martha's best friend turns killer."

19:05.872 --> 19:08.791
Just kidding.
Oh, my God.

19:08.792 --> 19:10.232
Did you know...?

19:14.712 --> 19:16.152
Hi!

19:21.232 --> 19:23.151
Maybe my puppy shouldn't hear this,
either.

19:23.152 --> 19:24.552
Come on... come on.

19:26.992 --> 19:29.112
Bye, Portia!

19:33.832 --> 19:37.111
Were you shocked
that he was bisexual?

19:37.112 --> 19:40.471
No, we already know.
Oh, you did? Well... yeah.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.231
After Mom died, when Dad was in jail

19:43.232 --> 19:45.311
and we were going for
the bond hearing,

19:45.312 --> 19:49.151
Caitlin was going to talk,
so they were, like, worried,

19:49.152 --> 19:51.391
because they'd found
all the pornography,

19:51.392 --> 19:53.671
and so Rudolf was worried about,

19:53.672 --> 19:56.271
like, Caitlin going up
into the stand

19:56.272 --> 19:59.431
and being surprised at
the whole bisexuality thing.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.791
And so... so they told us, you know?

20:02.792 --> 20:05.311
And I remember Todd was the one,
he sat me down, he was like,

20:05.312 --> 20:07.871
"Margaret, I just need to tell you,
you know, Dad's bisexual."

20:07.872 --> 20:09.991
And I was like,
"Oh, OK, that's fine."

20:09.992 --> 20:13.511
It was one of those things that he
was, like, "No, no, he's bisexual."

20:13.512 --> 20:15.631
And I was like,
"OK, that makes sense.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.591
"Like, is there anything else?

20:17.592 --> 20:20.231
"Is there something more important
that you wanted to tell me?"

20:20.232 --> 20:21.871
He's like,
"No, are you OK with that?"

20:21.872 --> 20:26.351
I was like, "Yeah.
It doesn't matter. I don't care."

20:26.352 --> 20:29.071
It was just one of those things
that...

20:29.072 --> 20:32.191
I mean, we already knew
and... so what?

20:32.192 --> 20:35.031
It was not a big deal. No. Yeah.

20:35.032 --> 20:36.431
I don't...

20:36.432 --> 20:38.031
Like, he's so strong.

20:38.032 --> 20:41.631
You know, he's...
They're bringing everything,

20:41.632 --> 20:44.631
like, the deepest, darkest secrets
of him out,

20:44.632 --> 20:47.631
and... putting them on display
for the nation

20:47.632 --> 20:50.031
and making a mockery of him, and...

20:50.032 --> 20:51.191
Well, could you imagine?

20:51.192 --> 20:54.230
They could take your whole life,
as of right now,

20:54.231 --> 20:57.270
take everything you've ever done
out of context,

20:57.271 --> 21:00.110
and blow it up there on
a huge poster

21:00.111 --> 21:04.430
and bring in people to talk about it
and how the experts talk about it,

21:04.431 --> 21:06.510
and... it's disgusting.

21:06.511 --> 21:09.150
They can do that to anyone.
You can't judge someone

21:09.151 --> 21:13.871
by what the media points out
as their shortcomings, you know?

21:17.911 --> 21:21.030
You know what Craig Jarvis
from the NNO told me today?

21:21.031 --> 21:23.510
He said when he was trying to figure
out the cost of the trial,

21:23.511 --> 21:27.870
he got the impression that Michael
just pays a flat fee.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.310
It's not by the hour.

21:29.311 --> 21:33.350
We could ask our host that tonight,
if she knows how it works.

21:33.351 --> 21:35.710
I don't know if it's just a flat fee
for just the trial part,

21:35.711 --> 21:37.911
or a flat fee for
the whole murder case.

21:39.391 --> 21:40.910
I don't see how they could do that,

21:40.911 --> 21:43.950
because they didn't know they would
end up going to Germany twice.

21:43.951 --> 21:46.510
I mean, talk about a...
I don't know, I'll have to...

21:46.511 --> 21:49.190
..you know, unpredictable expense.

21:49.191 --> 21:51.910
Cos I'm sure Michael didn't say,
"By the way, there's something

21:51.911 --> 21:54.350
"that happened in Germany
you might have to defend me about."

21:54.351 --> 21:56.390
"Oh, and by the way, I'm gay
and, oh, by the way,

21:56.391 --> 21:59.911
"there's another dead woman",
and... yeah.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.391
There's the cemetery.

22:03.791 --> 22:07.511
Doing this for you, Kathleen.
Doing this for you.

22:20.071 --> 22:24.150
Um... this is obviously
the headstone and, Lori,

22:24.151 --> 22:25.870
you said she goes this way, right?

22:25.871 --> 22:29.390
No. No. Her head is here
and her feet are there. OK.

22:29.391 --> 22:32.791
So this is where she is and
that's it, but I'd kind of like...

22:34.111 --> 22:35.990
Depending on what you suggest, a...

22:35.991 --> 22:37.510
I don't know, what do you suggest?

22:37.511 --> 22:39.550
What I can do is maybe draw up a
sketch

22:39.551 --> 22:41.870
and give you an idea of what
the plannings would be.

22:41.871 --> 22:44.750
You know, we're here right now,
but once the trial is over, I mean,

22:44.751 --> 22:47.590
we'll be coming some,
but not all the time, to tend it.

22:47.591 --> 22:51.550
The only thing I can share with you
is that my sister loved roses and...

22:51.551 --> 22:53.750
But I don't know if you have a breed

22:53.751 --> 22:55.830
that can, without a lot
of tending, make it.

22:55.831 --> 22:58.190
There are some.
There is a variety called Carefree

22:58.191 --> 23:01.990
that may not need as much spraying
and maintenance as the normal ones.

23:01.991 --> 23:05.310
I don't know if it'd get enough sun
underneath this big oak tree...

23:05.311 --> 23:06.870
That's kind of tough.

23:06.871 --> 23:08.909
I don't know -
maybe we could do something...

23:08.910 --> 23:13.109
Something there and then,
you know, like this, like a U-shape.

23:13.110 --> 23:14.669
Some kind of thing...

23:14.670 --> 23:16.709
I don't know if there are
any good perennials.

23:16.710 --> 23:19.909
I was thinking of Bleeding Hearts,
but...

23:19.910 --> 23:22.349
If we can agree on this,
how soon can you do it?

23:22.350 --> 23:25.469
Probably within the next week or so.
It's not a huge job,

23:25.470 --> 23:28.390
but I've got enough guys
that I could do that.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.629
Well, I didn't want "Peterson"
on there,

23:42.630 --> 23:45.149
but nobody would listen to me, so...

23:45.150 --> 23:46.830
Well, what's done is done.

23:53.310 --> 23:55.030
She was happy when she married him.

24:27.350 --> 24:29.389
Mr Sachs.
Your Honour, obviously,

24:29.390 --> 24:31.749
we believe that this evidence
is clearly relevant

24:31.750 --> 24:33.469
and clearly should be admissible.

24:33.470 --> 24:35.189
In a lot of ways,
even giving the defendant

24:35.190 --> 24:37.829
the benefit of the doubt, and saying
he had nothing to do with this,

24:37.830 --> 24:39.509
this evidence would still
be admissible

24:39.510 --> 24:41.869
simply as relevant circumstantial
evidence.

24:41.870 --> 24:45.309
Even if this was an accident
over in Germany, in 1985,

24:45.310 --> 24:48.429
he has seen the scene and seen what
an accident may have looked like,

24:48.430 --> 24:49.949
knowing what a model -

24:49.950 --> 24:53.029
using it as a model,
or a blueprint, so to speak -

24:53.030 --> 24:56.509
when this case is committed
now in 2001.

24:56.510 --> 25:00.069
When you look at the similarities
between the two, they are striking.

25:00.070 --> 25:02.949
Obviously the most striking thing
about it is that we have here now

25:02.950 --> 25:05.589
this defendant who's involved
with a case where two women are

25:05.590 --> 25:07.469
found at the bottom of the stairway,
dead.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.149
There is large amounts
of blood present,

25:09.150 --> 25:11.629
there is splatter high up on
the wall next to the stairway,

25:11.630 --> 25:14.869
the blood is dry on the wall,
there are small spray patterns

25:14.870 --> 25:16.829
of blood that are identified
on the wall.

25:16.830 --> 25:19.149
Both of the victims, obviously,

25:19.150 --> 25:22.149
are female and had close personal
relationships to the defendant.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.828
The are both in their mid-40s
when this occurred.

25:24.829 --> 25:26.108
They actually look alike -

25:26.109 --> 25:28.828
the physical similarities between
the two are amazing.

25:28.829 --> 25:30.988
They're both later determined
to be homicides,

25:30.989 --> 25:34.188
after subsequent autopsy,
by blunt force trauma.

25:34.189 --> 25:36.908
Scalp lacerations -
how coincidental is that?

25:36.909 --> 25:40.388
That it is the same number of scalp
lacerations on each of them,

25:40.389 --> 25:43.428
and both severe, down to the skull.

25:43.429 --> 25:45.988
The presence of defensive
wounds on the bodies.

25:45.989 --> 25:48.828
The defendant was the last person
to see them alive.

25:48.829 --> 25:51.108
The defendant is on the scene
when the authorities arrive

25:51.109 --> 25:54.468
each time and he reports,
both to authorities and to others -

25:54.469 --> 25:56.388
to friends and people who come -

25:56.389 --> 25:59.749
that each of these persons died
by falling down the stairs.

26:01.589 --> 26:03.828
So, what we've got, here,
on the bottom line,

26:03.829 --> 26:06.588
is the detectives who came to
the house saw nothing suspicious -

26:06.589 --> 26:08.268
and this was before any clean-up.

26:08.269 --> 26:10.868
Steve Lyons, the Army agent
who came to the house,

26:10.869 --> 26:12.388
saw nothing suspicious.

26:12.389 --> 26:15.548
The German doctor who came to
the house saw nothing suspicious.

26:15.549 --> 26:17.468
There was no evidence
that Mrs Ratliff

26:17.469 --> 26:19.988
had any personal relationship
with Michael Peterson

26:19.989 --> 26:23.668
or anybody else that would
have provided a motive for murder

26:23.669 --> 26:25.668
and there was no financial gain -

26:25.669 --> 26:29.308
in fact, he ending up raising
her two children to adulthood,

26:29.309 --> 26:32.508
the initial estate was worth
about 35,000,

26:32.509 --> 26:34.508
including pine trees in Australia.

26:34.509 --> 26:38.908
And from all of that, you have
a situation where, in essence,

26:38.909 --> 26:40.508
there is no substantial evidence

26:40.509 --> 26:42.388
from which a jury
could reasonably find

26:42.389 --> 26:44.468
that Michael Peterson
was responsible

26:44.469 --> 26:46.589
for the death of Elizabeth Ratliff.

26:47.749 --> 26:50.509
Anything else? No, your Honour.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.148
All right, then, thank you, Counsel.

26:55.149 --> 26:59.548
The court does agree with the State,
Mr Sachs,

26:59.549 --> 27:04.828
that the evidence of Mrs Ratliff's
death is admissible

27:04.829 --> 27:07.588
under 402 and 404b.

27:07.589 --> 27:11.028
State's motion is allowed.
The defendant's is denied.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.388
The prosecutors are going to try
and tell this jury that

27:13.389 --> 27:16.028
Michael Peterson was responsible
for that woman's death,

27:16.029 --> 27:18.788
and was responsible
for Kathleen Peterson's death,

27:18.789 --> 27:21.868
and they are going to say both women
died in a similar way,

27:21.869 --> 27:23.548
at the bottom of the staircase.

27:23.549 --> 27:26.628
Now, another note, ironic,
on the bottom of all this,

27:26.629 --> 27:30.788
is that the two daughters that were
adopted by Michael Peterson

27:30.789 --> 27:33.388
where the daughters
of Elizabeth Ratliff,

27:33.389 --> 27:35.868
that woman that died
18 years ago in Germany.

27:35.869 --> 27:37.748
They were raised
by Michael Peterson,

27:37.749 --> 27:41.147
raised as his own daughters,
and they refer to him as Dad

27:41.148 --> 27:43.867
and, as I told you before,
those two girls,

27:43.868 --> 27:45.867
who are now grown-up and
in their 20s,

27:45.868 --> 27:47.827
are supporting Michael Peterson.

27:47.828 --> 27:49.787
So, while prosecutors,
on the one hand,

27:49.788 --> 27:53.587
say Michael Peterson is responsible
for killing their biological mother

27:53.588 --> 27:55.427
and for killing their stepmother,

27:55.428 --> 27:58.548
who was helping to raise them,
they are saying, "No."

28:05.388 --> 28:07.148
All right - any further evidence?

28:10.068 --> 28:15.027
On the morning of November 25th,
did you go to Miss Ratliff's house?

28:15.028 --> 28:17.107
Yes, I did.
And how did you arrive there?

28:17.108 --> 28:18.627
I arrived by taxi.

28:18.628 --> 28:21.387
So, after you actually put the key
in the door and opened the door,

28:21.388 --> 28:23.187
what happened next?

28:23.188 --> 28:27.987
I see all the lights are on
and I see this body lying there.

28:27.988 --> 28:29.627
Did you see blood?

28:29.628 --> 28:30.867
Oh, yes.

28:30.868 --> 28:32.467
Where did you see blood?

28:32.468 --> 28:36.387
All the stairway, up the stairway,
there was blood.

28:36.388 --> 28:38.627
Liz was lying in a pool of blood.

28:38.628 --> 28:41.867
Can you recall where, if anywhere,
you saw blood on her?

28:41.868 --> 28:44.827
I don't remember - I'm sure I did
really look at her,

28:44.828 --> 28:49.067
but I don't remember
if she was... where blood was on her.

28:49.068 --> 28:51.587
It was just everywhere.
What next did you do?

28:51.588 --> 28:54.187
I ran over to the Peterson house.
What happened?

28:54.188 --> 28:57.347
I told Patty that something terrible
had happened, they have to come.

28:57.348 --> 28:59.507
Did you see Michael Peterson
at that time?

28:59.508 --> 29:02.987
As I was talking to Patty,
he came to the top of the stairs.

29:02.988 --> 29:04.827
Was he dressed or not?
He was...

29:04.828 --> 29:09.587
No, he wasn't dressed. He was in
his T-shirt and boxer shorts.

29:09.588 --> 29:10.987
What next did you do?

29:10.988 --> 29:13.867
Michael came running over with me.

29:13.868 --> 29:16.827
What did you do? I ran upstairs
to see if the babies were OK.

29:16.828 --> 29:19.987
And when you went there, what did
you find concerning the children?

29:19.988 --> 29:21.547
The babies were still asleep.

29:21.548 --> 29:22.907
So, what did you do?

29:22.908 --> 29:24.908
I wanted to go in the toilet
and vomit.

29:26.868 --> 29:29.107
All right. What happened next?

29:29.108 --> 29:33.267
I was in the toilet and Michael
came upstairs and he is telling me

29:33.268 --> 29:36.707
to get a sheet, to get a blanket,
and I said, "Why?"

29:36.708 --> 29:39.867
He said he wanted to cover Liz up.

29:39.868 --> 29:41.507
And he said she was dead.

29:41.508 --> 29:44.947
And I said, "No, no, I felt her.
She's warm."

29:44.948 --> 29:47.107
And he says,
"She's not warm, Barbara."

29:47.108 --> 29:50.867
He took me by the arms and he said,
"She's not warm, she's dead.

29:50.868 --> 29:53.747
"The warmth comes
from the floor heating."

29:56.067 --> 29:57.666
What then did you do?

29:57.667 --> 29:59.746
I walked in the door.

29:59.747 --> 30:01.306
I saw Michael in the corner,

30:01.307 --> 30:03.587
and he was standing like this.

30:05.147 --> 30:07.586
And then I turned
and I looked at Patty,

30:07.587 --> 30:11.106
and Patty was really slumped over,
staring into space.

30:11.107 --> 30:13.786
She was really in bad shape.

30:13.787 --> 30:15.387
What then do you do?

30:17.227 --> 30:21.026
I asked what had happened
and I looked around.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.746
There was a lot of blood
on the floor.

30:23.747 --> 30:25.746
And I looked up the walls

30:25.747 --> 30:28.906
and there was a lot of blood
on the walls.

30:28.907 --> 30:32.426
Now, Liz was covered,
I couldn't see her.

30:32.427 --> 30:36.107
There was a coat,
I think it was a coat, over her.

30:37.187 --> 30:42.426
And I couldn't see even her head,
but her hair was, like,

30:42.427 --> 30:45.466
down over her face, like this.

30:45.467 --> 30:48.346
All right, now, you say you enquired
as to what had happened

30:48.347 --> 30:50.746
and did anyone give you
any information at that time?

30:50.747 --> 30:53.786
Michael said that
she had a brain aneurysm,

30:53.787 --> 30:59.226
she had had this and that she must
have fallen down the stairs.

30:59.227 --> 31:01.906
What is the next thing that
you remember happening?

31:01.907 --> 31:06.226
I saw a bloody footprint down
the bottom of the stairs and I said,

31:06.227 --> 31:10.426
"This is a crime scene and
somebody needs to investigate it,

31:10.427 --> 31:13.306
"so please don't walk
up the stairs."

31:13.307 --> 31:17.186
Did anybody make any comment
to what you had said?

31:17.187 --> 31:22.546
Barbara said, "That's my footprint,
that's when I went to get Martha,

31:22.547 --> 31:25.267
"Martha baby and Gigi,
and I carried them out."

31:27.387 --> 31:28.666
So, what happened then?

31:28.667 --> 31:30.626
Well, there was a lot of commotion.

31:30.627 --> 31:34.586
Barbara was hysterical,
the nanny was hysterical,

31:34.587 --> 31:36.906
she was shaking, visibly shaking.

31:36.907 --> 31:40.346
She was very loud, crying, sobbing,

31:40.347 --> 31:42.827
I think I was crying and sobbing,
I think...

31:46.547 --> 31:50.826
I think a lot of people
were crying and sobbing.

31:50.827 --> 31:54.666
While you were there in her home,
did you notice any blood?

31:54.667 --> 31:57.666
There was blood all the way
down the wall

31:57.667 --> 32:00.186
that is adjacent to the staircase.

32:00.187 --> 32:03.786
There's blood over on the wall,
on the other side of the foyer,

32:03.787 --> 32:05.866
and there was blood on a little,

32:05.867 --> 32:09.385
this side of the wall
over on the foyer too.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.745
While the investigators were there,
was the blood still on the wall?

32:12.746 --> 32:17.385
The blood was there until
we moved Liz into the side bedroom.

32:17.386 --> 32:19.425
And who was cleaning the blood?

32:19.426 --> 32:26.465
In my memory I am sure that Tom and
I cleaned the blood off the walls.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.905
And over what period of time
did you clean?

32:28.906 --> 32:32.745
It seems like
we cleaned blood most of the day.

32:32.746 --> 32:35.065
You know, Rosemary,
I've said many, many times,

32:35.066 --> 32:40.585
there is no coincidence in criminal
law and I'm just wondering

32:40.586 --> 32:47.745
how Todd and the other two Ratliff
girls don't see these similarities.

32:47.746 --> 32:51.386
Maybe they don't want to see
the similarities, Rosemary.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.545
I believe they don't want
to see the similarities.

32:55.546 --> 32:57.425
They can't believe that

32:57.426 --> 33:00.305
the person they've known since

33:00.306 --> 33:05.585
they were babies and that has raised
them, it just is not possible.

33:05.586 --> 33:08.745
It happened to my sister in 1985

33:08.746 --> 33:13.305
and the same thing happened
to Kathleen in 2001.

33:13.306 --> 33:17.505
It was... Oh, boy, is she fucking...
..on purpose. They were murdered.

33:17.506 --> 33:22.265
Rosemary... And I have seen
personally Michael Peterson's fury,

33:22.266 --> 33:24.465
which is scary.

33:24.466 --> 33:28.505
It really scared me into not
wanting to go down there again.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.665
Two times in my whole life
I've seen that stupid woman

33:32.666 --> 33:35.785
and she says I have
a terrible temper.

33:35.786 --> 33:37.225
It's just awful.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.505
Yeah, here it is.

33:38.506 --> 33:40.105
And, Caitlin...

33:40.106 --> 33:41.905
Yes, vicious temper.

33:41.906 --> 33:44.345
Grr! Temper! Grr!

33:44.346 --> 33:45.785
Grr!

33:45.786 --> 33:47.146
SHE LAUGHS

33:48.506 --> 33:49.705
PHONE RINGS

33:49.706 --> 33:50.786
Shit.

33:54.026 --> 33:56.386
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

33:58.066 --> 33:59.985
Hello?

33:59.986 --> 34:01.146
Yeah.

34:02.826 --> 34:06.225
Well, no, they're going to lose
the case for a lot of reasons, Mike.

34:06.226 --> 34:09.545
Duh - I didn't do anything. Number
two, there's no murder weapon.

34:09.545 --> 34:11.185
Number three, there's no motive.

34:11.186 --> 34:13.145
Jesus!

34:13.146 --> 34:14.386
Ah, OK.

34:21.786 --> 34:24.424
Oh, you know what?
That's another one. Rosemary...

34:24.425 --> 34:27.704
You know how many times I've seen
Rosemary in my whole life? Twice.

34:27.705 --> 34:30.024
Once 15 years ago and then

34:30.025 --> 34:33.905
one time she came down for
Margaret's graduation. That was it.

34:35.105 --> 34:37.545
Yeah. Oh, yeah. He's hired, yeah.

34:38.625 --> 34:42.623
Well, as I have always cautioned,
never underestimate anybody.

34:42.625 --> 34:45.784
It's a good way to lose
football games and wars.

34:47.665 --> 34:50.264
I don't know, I just, I found myself
a couple of times, like,

34:50.264 --> 34:53.384
sitting up straighter in court when
people were talking about my dad

34:53.385 --> 34:55.623
and I'll just,
I'll be really, like, indignant,

34:55.625 --> 34:58.344
I'll just be like, "This is
my father you're talking about,

34:58.345 --> 35:01.624
"you know, like I have a lot of
pride in him, this is our family

35:01.625 --> 35:04.944
"you're talking about," and
the fact that I know he's innocent

35:04.945 --> 35:09.344
and the fact that, like, hopefully
people can see it through me now,

35:09.345 --> 35:12.825
people can see it in me
that he is innocent and...

35:15.385 --> 35:19.424
I don't know, I think, I think that
helps, sometimes, to get through it.

35:19.425 --> 35:22.424
You know the DA's trying to
say basically that our dad

35:22.425 --> 35:26.664
killed our birth mother and our
mother, but where are we sitting?

35:26.665 --> 35:28.385
We're sitting behind our dad.

35:29.825 --> 35:32.504
Now, shortly before she died,

35:32.505 --> 35:35.944
I think it was the Thursday of
the week before Thanksgiving,

35:35.945 --> 35:40.544
you talked with Liz and she talked
about suffering severe headaches.

35:40.545 --> 35:44.144
She came to my room about
three o'clock on that Thursday

35:44.145 --> 35:45.944
and she was pale.

35:45.945 --> 35:49.584
She looked bad and
she held her head like this

35:49.585 --> 35:51.304
and she said... I asked her

35:51.305 --> 35:55.024
what was wrong and she said she just
had the most severe headache

35:55.025 --> 35:59.304
and that she did make an appointment
to go to the medical facility

35:59.305 --> 36:02.864
and that she had an appointment on
Tuesday. The following week. Yes.

36:02.865 --> 36:06.224
So she never actually got to see a
doctor about these severe headaches.

36:06.225 --> 36:07.584
No.

36:07.585 --> 36:12.024
Now, your husband, what was his rank
in the military at the time?

36:12.025 --> 36:14.504
I believe he was
a major at that point.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.264
I'm not sure if he was promoted.

36:16.265 --> 36:20.384
He never went up to any
of the authorities and said,

36:20.385 --> 36:23.224
"We're concerned that
this is a crime scene", did he?

36:23.225 --> 36:26.064
No, because he was
very concerned about it and

36:26.065 --> 36:28.064
he was waiting to see
what they would say.

36:28.065 --> 36:30.264
His example to me was,

36:30.265 --> 36:37.224
if I was flying a plane
and someone reported a fire on it,

36:37.225 --> 36:39.464
would you trust me to
put out the fire?

36:39.465 --> 36:42.263
Would you trust my expertise
to put out the fire?

36:42.264 --> 36:44.743
And he trusted
their expertise that day.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.743
OK, well, ma'am, if you were
on a plane and there was fire

36:47.744 --> 36:50.463
and it continued to burn and
continued to burn and nobody

36:50.464 --> 36:53.983
did anything, at some point you
would say something, wouldn't you?

36:53.984 --> 36:57.103
I would be waiting for a day
that I could put the fire out

36:57.104 --> 37:00.343
and I guess that's why I'm here
today, to help put the fire out.

37:00.344 --> 37:03.543
And this is 18 years later. Yes.

37:03.544 --> 37:07.183
They have telephones in Germany,
don't they? Yes, they do.

37:07.184 --> 37:10.543
And you could have called
somebody the next day.

37:10.544 --> 37:13.503
It's a scary thing to go
to the police and say,

37:13.504 --> 37:16.023
"I think that
there's foul play here."

37:16.024 --> 37:21.223
In fact, during all of 1985,
you didn't call anybody. No.

37:21.224 --> 37:23.904
No, we've had to live with this
all these years.

37:25.464 --> 37:30.103
The first time you actually ever
gave a statement about these events

37:30.104 --> 37:35.463
to anybody in authority was
in the year 2002. That's correct.

37:35.464 --> 37:40.863
And you actually wrote out
a statement to... Detective Holland?

37:40.864 --> 37:42.063
Uh, yes.

37:42.064 --> 37:45.423
OK, and this statement contained
all the significant memories

37:45.424 --> 37:49.863
you had about how Elizabeth Ratliff
died and Michael Peterson's

37:49.864 --> 37:51.503
involvement in that. Correct?

37:51.504 --> 37:54.783
It contained every significant thing
that I could remember at that time

37:54.784 --> 37:57.103
until I began to
remember more things.

37:57.104 --> 37:59.663
OK, well, let's go through
what you could remember

37:59.664 --> 38:01.623
when you wrote to Detective Holland.

38:01.624 --> 38:05.983
Nowhere in this statement
did you say that Michael Peterson

38:05.984 --> 38:09.023
said anything about
there being a cerebral haemorrhage

38:09.024 --> 38:12.423
before the German police arrived.
Did you? No.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.183
In fact, although you knew
this statement was about

38:15.184 --> 38:18.383
Michael Peterson, an investigation
of Michael Peterson,

38:18.384 --> 38:21.983
you didn't say anything about him
at all, did you? No.

38:21.984 --> 38:25.303
Didn't even mention his name.
No, I didn't.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.783
Didn't mention this bloody
footprint you now recall.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.023
No.

38:30.024 --> 38:34.463
You talk about the fact that
Miss O'Hara, now Miss Malagnino,

38:34.464 --> 38:37.783
summoned you.
She was frantic at that point?

38:37.784 --> 38:39.663
She was upset. "Come quick."

38:39.664 --> 38:42.783
By the way, the girls, it says here
the two girls were still in bed?

38:42.784 --> 38:44.583
Yes. That's Margaret and Martha.

38:44.584 --> 38:46.703
They didn't stay there
the whole time?

38:46.704 --> 38:48.183
No, Barbara had removed them.

38:48.184 --> 38:50.983
I didn't remember that until later
when I saw the footprint.

38:50.984 --> 38:53.743
When I remembered seeing
the bloody footprint on the stairs,

38:53.744 --> 38:56.862
then I remembered that she had gone
upstairs and taken them away.

38:56.863 --> 38:58.982
That was one of my flashbacks. So...

38:58.983 --> 39:01.263
Flashbacks?
Have you been having flashbacks?

39:02.303 --> 39:05.702
Flashbacks of the scenes
in short pictures.

39:05.703 --> 39:09.822
Flashbacks come as short memories,
very short memories.

39:09.823 --> 39:13.862
You arrived in Durham
a week or so ago?

39:13.863 --> 39:16.302
Almost two weeks ago. OK.

39:16.303 --> 39:20.462
And you've been in contact
with other witnesses?

39:20.463 --> 39:23.182
I've seen other witnesses,
that's correct.

39:23.183 --> 39:28.022
And just seeing people has
caused you to have flashbacks

39:28.023 --> 39:32.382
of new memories that
you didn't have in March of 2002?

39:32.383 --> 39:36.142
Hearing their voices
has brought back some memories.

39:36.143 --> 39:39.062
The messages,
the images are very, very vivid.

39:39.063 --> 39:40.662
Some of them are in colour.

39:40.663 --> 39:44.302
The things you've been testifying
today that you didn't write

39:44.303 --> 39:48.302
in March of 2002 are the result
of these flashbacks, correct?

39:48.303 --> 39:52.462
A lot of memories came
before I even arrived here.

39:52.463 --> 39:54.182
And those were also flashbacks?

39:54.183 --> 39:55.223
Yes.

39:56.383 --> 39:58.862
I don't know if this is...

39:58.863 --> 40:04.382
I don't know if this is ours or
your mother's. Porcelain de Paris.

40:04.383 --> 40:06.662
I don't know. I mean, it's been...

40:06.663 --> 40:07.862
I have no idea.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.862
Can I take one of
the pie plates to school?

40:10.863 --> 40:13.663
Yeah. We own about ten of them.

40:16.423 --> 40:19.622
I like the blue one better. Yeah, I
don't think this was your mother's.

40:19.623 --> 40:22.542
That's too ugly to be your mother's.
I don't think that one is hers.

40:22.543 --> 40:24.782
I believe...
Yeah, this is your mother's.

40:24.783 --> 40:27.583
Because there used to be
a Rosenthal outlet...

40:30.543 --> 40:33.022
..not far from where we lived.

40:33.023 --> 40:35.942
And your mother would go and buy
an odd piece, you know,

40:35.943 --> 40:39.222
seconds or every now and then
a piece of Rosenthal. This was one.

40:39.223 --> 40:41.502
There are a couple of them,
but over the years

40:41.503 --> 40:44.503
around half of them have been broken
or lost or something.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.822
But literally anything... Oh,
this would be hers. Yeah. Anything.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.782
This is a Rosenthal,
I'm sure it's Rosenthal.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.702
Yeah, anything that says
Rosenthal... Is our birth mom's.

40:54.703 --> 40:57.422
Is your mother's, yeah.
I was with her when she bought it.

40:57.423 --> 41:00.502
Sometimes we'd go by a bunch of it,
so if you go through,

41:00.503 --> 41:02.622
if it says Rosenthal, it's...

41:02.623 --> 41:04.342
So we know what not to break.

41:04.343 --> 41:05.542
GIRLS LAUGH

41:05.543 --> 41:07.782
I hope I'm not breaking anything.
I'm just joking.

41:07.783 --> 41:10.341
Yeah, one of your favourite things
to do after dinner would be

41:10.342 --> 41:14.341
walk us around the house
and show us everything that
was going to be ours.

41:14.342 --> 41:16.741
I mean, you always did that.
We always knew.

41:16.742 --> 41:19.342
People are just ignorant,
that's all.

41:21.582 --> 41:23.901
Oh, my God. Portia!

41:23.902 --> 41:26.101
Baby, Portia! Where...

41:26.102 --> 41:27.781
Portia, Portia!

41:27.782 --> 41:29.301
Look, baby.

41:29.302 --> 41:33.221
You know how everyone in Germany
is saying that they cleaned up

41:33.222 --> 41:37.061
so much blood and didn't your dad
say there was no blood?

41:37.062 --> 41:38.541
Well, there's a... What?

41:38.542 --> 41:41.821
The CID agent who went,
who came after the scene,

41:41.822 --> 41:44.261
he wrote a report
and it said that...

41:44.262 --> 41:46.021
The only blood was under her head.

41:46.022 --> 41:49.421
Yeah. Just where she was...
had hit her head. And so...

41:49.422 --> 41:50.861
And so are they making that up?

41:50.862 --> 41:53.221
I don't know. It's hard to tell.

41:53.222 --> 41:55.781
I mean, maybe they did.
She was saying...

41:55.782 --> 41:59.261
She had seven lacerations, they
had to clean up blood, right? Yeah.

41:59.262 --> 42:02.661
And she had a bleeding disorder.
Right. Yeah.

42:02.662 --> 42:07.101
Maybe there was more blood than
people want to remember but...

42:07.102 --> 42:09.541
The bottom line is,
I just don't care.

42:09.542 --> 42:13.661
Like, it happened 18 years ago and
our dad had nothing to do with it

42:13.662 --> 42:16.021
and there's nothing
that they've said

42:16.022 --> 42:20.181
that ties Dad to anything negative,
so it just doesn't make any sense.

42:20.182 --> 42:23.581
It's just what you would think.
Yeah. It just pisses me off.

42:23.582 --> 42:25.541
But it still feels like a big deal

42:25.542 --> 42:28.821
because, I mean, saying that
there's that much blood,

42:28.822 --> 42:32.741
it makes it similar to the...
to our stepmom, and so...

42:32.742 --> 42:36.621
Not only our stepmom.
Well, I mean... To Mom.

42:36.622 --> 42:38.941
To Mom, yeah. And...

42:38.942 --> 42:40.222
I don't know.

42:41.462 --> 42:42.782
Oh, my God.

42:43.862 --> 42:50.541
Did you have the occasion to become
involved with the autopsy of

42:50.542 --> 42:53.221
Elizabeth Ratliff?

42:53.222 --> 42:54.661
Yes, I did.

42:54.662 --> 43:00.341
Do you have an opinion as to
her cause of death? Yes, I do.

43:00.342 --> 43:02.261
What is that opinion?

43:02.262 --> 43:04.701
In my opinion the cause
of death of Mrs Ratliff

43:04.702 --> 43:06.182
was blunt trauma of the head.

43:07.822 --> 43:12.541
Do you also have an opinion as to
the manner of Mrs Ratliff's death?

43:12.542 --> 43:14.461
In my opinion... Objection.

43:14.462 --> 43:15.901
Overruled. In my opinion,

43:15.902 --> 43:19.262
the manner of death in
Mrs Ratliff's case was homicide.

43:21.062 --> 43:25.141
When I think about Elizabeth
Ratliff's death, the question

43:25.142 --> 43:28.741
that strikes me as the most
important one is, when did she die?

43:29.981 --> 43:32.340
And no-one has really
addressed that.

43:32.341 --> 43:36.181
Deborah Radisch apparently hasn't
even thought about that issue.

43:37.381 --> 43:40.820
But if she died at 11pm at night,

43:40.821 --> 43:43.700
which is what the state
would have you believe,

43:43.701 --> 43:49.020
we know as a matter of science that
by eight o'clock the next morning

43:49.021 --> 43:50.780
when her body was found,

43:50.781 --> 43:54.020
it would have substantial signs
of rigor mortis.

43:54.021 --> 43:57.340
It would be stiff,
and people don't forget that.

43:57.341 --> 44:00.980
When you move a body that's stiff,
you remember that.

44:00.981 --> 44:04.180
You can't do a spinal tap
very easily

44:04.181 --> 44:06.740
on a body that's in
full rigor mortis,

44:06.741 --> 44:09.420
or even substantial rigor mortis,

44:09.421 --> 44:12.420
so we know that
she wasn't in rigor mortis.

44:12.421 --> 44:17.060
We know that she couldn't have died
at 11 o'clock at night.

44:17.061 --> 44:21.860
Barbara Malagnino told us that her
body was still warm to the touch,

44:21.861 --> 44:26.020
and so, the physical evidence
is much more consistent with

44:26.021 --> 44:29.740
her having died
some time that morning

44:29.741 --> 44:33.420
than when the state said she died,

44:33.421 --> 44:36.140
late in the evening
the night before.

44:36.141 --> 44:41.300
One of the things that forensic
pathologists sometimes do is

44:41.301 --> 44:43.500
to determine a time of death.

44:43.501 --> 44:44.620
Yes.

44:44.621 --> 44:49.860
Rigor mortis, or "rye-gor" mortis,
is something that medical examiners

44:49.861 --> 44:53.220
use to at least get an estimate
of time of death, right?

44:53.221 --> 44:56.580
Yes, generally a rough estimate,
that would be correct.

44:56.581 --> 44:58.580
And rule of thumb is

44:58.581 --> 45:02.420
it develops pretty much
over about a 12-hour period,

45:02.421 --> 45:06.060
give or take some time... Yes.

45:06.061 --> 45:08.420
And it remains, and
when we're talking about rigor,

45:08.421 --> 45:11.300
we're talking about stiffness
to the touch, right? Yes.

45:11.301 --> 45:16.260
If somebody is found on a step
in a particular position

45:16.261 --> 45:20.420
and rigor has started,
you take them off the step,

45:20.421 --> 45:23.500
they're still going to be in
that position. That's correct.

45:23.501 --> 45:29.860
And so for example, if someone died
at 11pm, one would expect

45:29.861 --> 45:35.500
by eight o'clock or nine o'clock
or ten o'clock the next morning,

45:35.501 --> 45:38.660
certainly by 11 o'clock
the next morning,

45:38.661 --> 45:42.739
to see some
significant rigor, right?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.099
Yes.

45:44.100 --> 45:46.459
And do you know whether or not

45:46.460 --> 45:51.139
anyone who was with Elizabeth
Ratliff's body that morning

45:51.140 --> 45:58.419
from 8am till, say, 12 noon when her
body was moved into the next room,

45:58.420 --> 46:02.780
do you know whether anyone reported
any kind of rigor?

46:04.660 --> 46:07.979
No, I don't know if
anyone made that observation.

46:07.980 --> 46:13.859
And you know, do you not,
that Michael Peterson was at home

46:13.860 --> 46:20.459
with his then wife Patty when
Elizabeth Ratliff's body was found?

46:20.460 --> 46:21.700
Are you aware of that?

46:22.900 --> 46:25.419
No, I don't know.

46:25.420 --> 46:27.939
That's all I have.
Thank you, doctor.

46:27.940 --> 46:31.859
The state of North Carolina does not
intend to call additional witnesses

46:31.860 --> 46:34.139
and with that, the state
of North Carolina would

46:34.140 --> 46:35.859
rest its case in chief at this time.

46:35.860 --> 46:39.539
All right, Mr Rudolf. Will there
be evidence for the defendant?

46:39.540 --> 46:40.979
I'm not sure, Your Honour.

46:40.980 --> 46:45.179
We'll make a decision about that
tonight and if there is evidence,

46:45.180 --> 46:48.499
we'll certainly be prepared
to go forward on Monday morning.

46:48.500 --> 46:52.500
We will see you
Monday morning at 9:30.
