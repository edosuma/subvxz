WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:09.384
Alex, your papi will be here any minute.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.593
So get off your butt,

00:10.677 --> 00:12.637
turn all the pillows to their good side,

00:12.721 --> 00:14.681
and hide the ugly one in the closet.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.892
Why are we cleaning for Papi anyway?

00:17.976 --> 00:19.644
We're cleaning for his new girlfriend.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.647
And there's no way I'm gonna let
that woman think that we live like sucios.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.860
I cleaned under the bathroom sink.

00:26.943 --> 00:30.488
So Papi's girlfriend will be impressed
if she decides to steal a tampon.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.951
So, what is the deal with your papi?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.453
I'm here for you, mija.

00:36.536 --> 00:40.123
I can go from zero to flipping this table.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.291
Así.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.794
I-- I'm a little nervous to see him,

00:44.878 --> 00:48.465
but he says he's sober,
and he says he's okay with me being gay.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.050
You never know with him,

00:50.133 --> 00:52.844
so keep one hand under the table
just in case.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.014
And, Lupe, this new novia,

00:56.097 --> 00:59.100
am I pulling her hair?
Am I spitting in her café?

01:00.393 --> 01:03.313
It's fine. You know, I'm happy for him.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.106
She's probably blonde and thin

01:05.190 --> 01:07.942
and really excited to graduate college.

01:09.527 --> 01:10.361
[knocking on door]

01:10.445 --> 01:12.947
[Penelope] Oh, here we go.
All right, everybody, let's all be nice

01:13.031 --> 01:15.575
to the Instagram model
we'll probably never see again, okay?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.747
-Hey!
-Papi!

01:21.331 --> 01:23.750
Hey, wow! Looking good, Lupe.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.251
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.629
So is the place. Hey.

01:27.712 --> 01:28.880
Ugly pillow in the closet?

01:28.963 --> 01:30.131
You know it.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.257
So, you look good too.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.219
Where's... uh, Baby? I mean, Blondie.
I mean, your girlfriend.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.013
Hey. [chuckles]

01:54.155 --> 01:55.824
[both] Hi!

01:55.907 --> 01:58.284
[laughs] Oh, wow!

01:58.827 --> 02:01.246
Dang! Papi's got a type.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.127
-Uh, come in. Come in.
-Oh, okay.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.712
-I love your hair.
-Oh, I love your hair.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.883
Is that a ring?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.554
Uh, well, um,

02:17.637 --> 02:21.099
I thought we had a few more minutes
of small talk before we got there,

02:21.182 --> 02:22.976
but, um, yeah.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.019
Nicole is my fiancée.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.940
-Surprise! [chuckles]

03:35.006 --> 03:37.842
I know it must be awkward,
Victor coming by with his new fiancée.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.469
You think?

03:41.512 --> 03:43.848
It's not awkward. It's just surprising.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.101
You know, like,
"Oh, that guy won the election? Really?"

03:48.978 --> 03:50.104
But it worked out fine.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.483
[stammering] Listen, I am sorry.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.569
I just didn't want to introduce you
until things got really serious,

03:56.653 --> 03:59.614
but then they got really serious...
really fast.

04:00.156 --> 04:03.243
Alex, I am so excited to meet you.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.162
You're even more handsome in person
than you are in photos.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.374
All right! Welcome to the family.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.505
And, Elena, your papi has told me
so much about you.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.258
Just so I know,
what are your preferred pronouns?

04:19.676 --> 04:21.094
Oh!

04:23.388 --> 04:25.139
Well, my pronouns are she and her,

04:25.223 --> 04:27.976
and Syd, my significant other,
identifies as they.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.229
Thank you for asking.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.983
"She, they."
How do we keep people straight?

04:35.066 --> 04:36.859
So you wanna keep people straight?

04:38.361 --> 04:39.779
No, Elena, that's not what I meant.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.989
[in unison] Okay.

04:45.576 --> 04:48.162
My little sister, Mia,
identifies as queer,

04:48.246 --> 04:51.499
and she's teaching me how to be an ally
so I can pass it on to my students.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.042
-Oh, you're a teacher?
-Yeah.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.962
I'm a special education teacher
at an elementary school.

04:56.045 --> 04:56.921
Isn't she amazing?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.798
Yeah, and age-appropriate.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.552
Nothing to hate. [laughs]

05:03.636 --> 05:04.971
[chuckles]

05:05.054 --> 05:08.266
Did you think I was going to be
some young, blonde flaquita?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.268
[laughs]

05:15.315 --> 05:16.899
This is gonna put me in therapy.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.027
[door opens]

05:19.110 --> 05:21.988
-Hey, Pen. What up, hombre?
-Whoa.

05:22.071 --> 05:22.989
[laughs] Hey!

05:23.072 --> 05:24.699
So, where's this girlfriend?
Hey, Pen.

05:24.782 --> 05:25.867
Wait. What?

05:27.785 --> 05:30.121
Hey, Schneider, uh,
this is my fiancée, Nicole.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.333
What? Fiancée? That's great.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.376
-Wait. Am I mad about this?
-All good.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.962
-Locked it down, dawg!
-Yeah.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.131
-So, you got a best man yet?
-Uh, no, no.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.428
What's with the arms?

05:45.511 --> 05:49.098
You don't have a lot of friends in LA,
so obviously, I'm your best man.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.767
I'm gonna plan your bachelor party.

05:50.850 --> 05:55.313
Hashtag Vic-turn it up. [chuckles]

05:56.439 --> 05:58.066
No, no, I don't need any of that.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.651
Nicole's friends are throwing her
a little bachelorette thing,

06:00.735 --> 06:02.862
and I'm just gonna take
Elena and Alex to dinner.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.158
A dad-chelor party! [laughs]

06:07.241 --> 06:08.284
I could work with that.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.161
I'll go get my cargo shorts
and braided belt.

06:11.996 --> 06:12.830
[door closes]

06:12.914 --> 06:14.332
Does he understand he's not invited?

06:14.415 --> 06:15.541
Not since I've known him.

06:16.918 --> 06:17.919
Well, we should get going.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.339
It was so lovely to meet you.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.467
It was so great to meet you.
Thank you so much for those flowers.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.928
-Gracias, linda.
-Mucho gusto.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.055
-[Lydia] Nice to meet you.
-[Penelope] Have a good time.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.183
[Lydia] Hey, listen, don't be a stranger.
[chuckles]

06:32.683 --> 06:33.893
I can't stand her!

06:36.687 --> 06:39.065
Mami, she's fine.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.901
But who is she trying to fool
with that sexy laugh?

06:42.985 --> 06:47.365
Ay, paquete! The whole situation
is very, very fishy.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.742
Well, he's marrying his rebound, so...
[scoffs]

06:49.826 --> 06:51.285
And you have had more rebounds.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.081
As I heard it on the SportsCenter,

06:55.164 --> 06:57.458
whoever has the most rebounds wins.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.462
And now, you have Mateo.

07:01.546 --> 07:05.299
Right! That guy. He is so sweet.
He's been texting me all morning.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.009
I gotta text him back.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.805
I don't know.
Something is off with Victor.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.598
-It's too quick.
-Hmm.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.185
I am going to keep an eye
on him and his new bae.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.022
I will be on bae watch.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.941
Okay.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.778
But let's not get all worked up
about Nicole and Victor.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.698
They're going on with their lives,
and we should go on with ours.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.283
I'm so freaking mad!

07:31.826 --> 07:36.080
I'm the one that turned that mess
into that sexy hyena's dream man.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.251
I get that you're upset, Penelope,

07:40.334 --> 07:43.171
but I think the group
is having a hard time following you.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.755
Her ex got his crap together,

07:44.839 --> 07:46.757
and now, he's engaged
to a woman named Nicole.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.925
Keep up, Pam.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.306
-[sighs]
-So, he went from a Penny to a Nicole?

07:53.389 --> 07:57.143
[all laughing]

07:59.645 --> 08:01.105
-That's funny.
-Shut up!

08:02.815 --> 08:04.108
This sucks!

08:04.192 --> 08:06.152
Why do you think this is so activating?

08:06.527 --> 08:10.615
Is there a part of you that imagined
you and Victor would get back together?

08:10.698 --> 08:11.782
Hell no, Pam.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.243
[sighs] It's like this.

08:15.119 --> 08:17.121
Let's say you took in a stray dog.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.458
You fed him, bathed him,

08:20.541 --> 08:22.960
busted your butt to get him healthy.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.505
Then that dog up and ran away.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.007
A few years later,
you're watching a dog show,

08:28.090 --> 08:29.842
and guess who won the blue ribbon?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.886
That damn mutt you saved!

08:32.428 --> 08:34.263
You trained that dog.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.267
You deserve that ribbon,
and that dog should die alone.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.650
I'm not sure
that's the healthiest response.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.360
You should have had him neutered.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.611
-Exactly.
-Yes.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.906
I know a shady vet.
Want me to hook it up?

08:52.323 --> 08:54.450
-Ramona.
-[scoffs] It's not fair!

08:55.034 --> 08:57.245
You know, he's moving on,
and I've got no one.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.412
What about Mateo?

08:58.496 --> 09:00.456
Right, that guy.
I gotta text him back.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.337
It's clear that this encounter
has triggered some insecurities.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.383
I recommend some quiet time alone

09:10.466 --> 09:13.219
so that you can really process
these feelings.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.848
I'm getting over this tonight!

09:17.932 --> 09:19.934
[all] Whoo!

09:25.147 --> 09:27.483
As the front-runner for best man,

09:27.567 --> 09:30.403
I got you a little something
for your dad-chelor party.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.655
Bam!

09:33.531 --> 09:34.448
"V.A.G"?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.577
Victor Alvarez Guapísimo.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.915
Yeah, I'm not wearing a hat that says vag.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.544
I'll wear it.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.845
[cawing]

09:59.724 --> 10:01.058
Lydia, what are you doing here?

10:01.142 --> 10:05.021
I need you to invite me to the party
so I can spy on Victor.

10:05.104 --> 10:05.980
I think...

10:06.522 --> 10:08.316
I think he's drinking again.

10:08.899 --> 10:12.069
What? No, that's crazy.
He's sober. He wouldn't drink.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.280
No, I don't think he's sober anymore.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.116
When he drinks,
he's impulsive and irrational,

10:17.199 --> 10:20.703
and that is why he is rushing
into a marriage

10:20.786 --> 10:22.830
with dollar-store Lupita.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.336
Come on. Victor's sober.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.379
Sure, he's had his hard days.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.839
I know that better than anybody.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.091
But he's committed.
He has too much to lose.

10:34.175 --> 10:38.554
I'm just worried about the children.
I don't want to see them hurt again.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.099
Y por eso, I must watch his every move.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.643
But what if he sneaks off to the bar?

10:44.352 --> 10:45.478
I recruited a spy.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.028
Oh, hi.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.782
Wow! I barely recognized you, Dr. B.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.909
Don't say my name.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.994
Tonight, I am undercover.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.704
Another mudslide, Mr. Iglesias?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.082
Sí, señor.

11:07.416 --> 11:08.876
And keep them coming.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.300
-[sighs]
-Look who I found.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.594
[laughs] She's my plus-one.
Hope that's okay.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.929
Yeah, sure.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.723
Wouldn't be a dad-chelor party
without my ex-wife's mother.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.103
What are you wearing? [gasps]
"VAG"?

11:29.605 --> 11:31.232
Oh!

11:32.024 --> 11:35.820
Victor Alvarez Guapísimo.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.073
I want one.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.286
Seriously? A special ed teacher?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.206
The one thing you can't make fun of?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.377
She did that on purpose.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.963
Another round, ladies?

11:54.046 --> 11:57.216
-Sorry. Our Uber's here.
-Ugh! Bye.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.427
-[whines]
-[Jill] I'm out too.

11:59.927 --> 12:03.848
The last time I had this many shots,
I slept with my weed delivery guy.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.016
[laughs]

12:06.100 --> 12:07.476
So, later, locas.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.438
I'm staying.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.524
Oh, yes! Ramona, my ride or die!

12:13.607 --> 12:15.526
Hey, have a seat. Two more, please.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.154
[Penelope]
You know, maybe Pam was onto something.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.242
Like, maybe I-- I-- I am hung up on this

12:23.325 --> 12:27.204
because I'm insecure
about where I'm at in my life.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.373
But you got no reason to be, though.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.334
You're raising two smart kids.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.420
You got a boyfriend blowing up your phone.

12:34.503 --> 12:38.007
-Right, that guy! I gotta text him back.
-[Ramona] Yeah.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.217
You're about to be a nurse practitioner.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.095
And your body is tight!

12:43.179 --> 12:44.555
I'm telling you, lady,

12:44.638 --> 12:47.975
if you were gay,
and my knees weren't arthritic...

12:50.644 --> 12:52.229
I would get down there--

12:52.313 --> 12:53.355
Whoa!

12:54.231 --> 12:55.483
What?

12:56.066 --> 12:58.861
Propose to you. Ew!
Get your mind out of the gutter!

13:00.821 --> 13:02.031
But how drunk are you?

13:02.114 --> 13:05.618
[both laughing]

13:06.285 --> 13:08.746
Seriously, Penny, forget Nickel.

13:10.664 --> 13:14.543
You are the baddest bitch in here.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.462
It's my bachelorette party,

13:16.545 --> 13:18.798
and I'm the baddest bitch in here!

13:18.881 --> 13:21.008
[all] Whoo!

13:27.223 --> 13:29.725
I know that
this is all happening really quick,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.685
so I wanted to talk to you guys.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.270
Oh, yes, tell us.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.440
Yeah, let's crack that egg open
and get right to the yolk.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.152
[sighs] Uh, well...

13:40.236 --> 13:42.279
I was thinking it would be,
uh, just me and the kids,

13:42.363 --> 13:44.949
but, um... okay. [laughs] Uh...

13:45.282 --> 13:49.036
Well, I know this seems fast,
but Nicole is a really great person,

13:49.119 --> 13:51.163
and I would love it
if you guys would get to know her.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.249
So I hope you can spend some time
with us this week.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.420
Papi, before I answer,
I need to know something.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.758
Does your hotel have a pool?

14:06.637 --> 14:08.556
[sighs, chuckles]

14:09.348 --> 14:10.182
Yes.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.976
Then I'm in.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.732
So... [chuckles]
Nicole is from Portland, huh?

14:18.816 --> 14:22.444
I hear they have a huge LGBTQ+ community.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.781
Oh, yeah, they have a parade,
like, every week. [scoffs]

14:26.365 --> 14:27.575
Oh, is that a bad thing?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.577
No. No. I--

14:29.660 --> 14:31.620
I mean, when I'm trying to get to work,
it is,

14:31.704 --> 14:34.665
but, uh, well, that would be true
of a... of a straight parade.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.209
[stammers] I'm anti-parade.

14:37.751 --> 14:38.627
Yeah.

14:39.044 --> 14:43.424
[clears throat] Anyway, Nicole's sister,
Mia, she goes to them all the time.

14:43.507 --> 14:47.136
Oh, so, you're cool with her.
Did you go to her quinces?

14:53.559 --> 14:58.480
Why don't you use this awkward moment
to refresh my rum and Coke?

14:59.440 --> 15:03.777
It is weaker than a woman
who claims that childbirth is painful.

15:07.823 --> 15:08.741
Okay.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.286
What a gentleman, huh?

15:12.912 --> 15:13.954
I gotta go to the bathroom.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.707
If there's gonna be a big, dramatic scene,
wait till I get back.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.043
Of course.
I can't flip this table by myself.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.966
Uh, can we make this rum and Coke fit
for a Cuban grandma? No Coke.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.093
Good order.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.222
I also like a rum and Coke-caine.

15:34.934 --> 15:35.851
Excuse me?

15:36.185 --> 15:40.314
Oh, I was just saying
how much I enjoy the occasional soda,

15:40.397 --> 15:44.401
especially... with a little happy juice.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.071
-Uh... Hey.
-Oh!

15:48.113 --> 15:49.031
Cheers.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.034
-Oh. Okay. Uh...
-[laughs]

15:52.534 --> 15:53.535
Thank you. Thanks.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.954
Uh, but this isn't my drink.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.246
Oh, come on.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.667
It's not like I'm some honey trap.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.087
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you okay?

16:03.170 --> 16:05.381
You're looking
a little, uh, unsteady there, buddy.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.092
Says the guy with three heads.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.593
Wow.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.387
You know, I've been there.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.264
Listen, if... if you ever want to quit,

16:14.932 --> 16:16.141
give me a call.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.226
I'll save a seat for you.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.478
Yeah. Uh, can we call a cab for this guy?

16:19.561 --> 16:20.604
Just add it to my bill.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.899
Bless your heart.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.457
[all cheering]

16:41.333 --> 16:44.628
You know what me and her ending up
at the same bar is?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.046
A beatdown waiting to happen.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.509
I know a lawyer who can make it look
like she started it.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.970
-Want me to hook it up?
-No!

16:53.387 --> 16:55.014
It's a sign.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.684
I need to tell Nicole the truth
about the man she's gonna marry.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.310
Yeah, I don't think--

17:01.103 --> 17:01.979
Hey, girl.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.738
Penelope.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.908
Uh, everyone, this is Victor's ex-wife.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.243
[all] Oh!

17:17.911 --> 17:20.622
I know. I told you, right? She's gorgeous.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.961
Penelope, sit. Be a unicorn with me.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.590
-[slurring] Right, but we do need to talk.
-Yes, yes. Yeah.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.259
Before you say anything, can I just say...

17:34.636 --> 17:35.804
thank you?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.015
For what?

17:38.974 --> 17:41.060
For being an amazing woman

17:41.143 --> 17:43.645
who pushed Victor
to be the man he is today.

17:44.813 --> 17:48.317
He told me every horrible thing
he put your through

17:48.400 --> 17:49.818
when he was at his lowest,

17:50.444 --> 17:54.031
and the fact that you had the strength
to leave him

17:54.114 --> 17:56.784
so that he could realize
that he needed to get help,

17:57.201 --> 17:59.703
and how you managed
to salvage the relationship

17:59.787 --> 18:01.789
between him and your kids.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.832
[sighs] Girl!

18:05.084 --> 18:07.920
[laughing]
Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.255
I'm sorry for interrupting.
What did you want to tell me?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.759
[all cheering]

18:15.427 --> 18:16.804
You're so beautiful.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.433
You're so beautiful.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.311
[in unison] We're so beautiful!

18:24.394 --> 18:26.396
[both laughing]

18:31.026 --> 18:32.861
[both sigh]

18:32.945 --> 18:35.197
[sniffling]

18:36.824 --> 18:38.200
I came here tonight...

18:39.743 --> 18:41.954
to get drunk
and forget about you and Victor.

18:42.037 --> 18:45.207
And it's not because I'm not over him.
I am.

18:48.627 --> 18:52.214
I cried for months
until I had no tears left.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.134
But I became whole again.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.263
And I love the life I've built
as a single mom.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.644
But selfishly, I want him to be miserable.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.690
And I totally get that.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.109
If it's any comfort,

19:12.192 --> 19:14.278
he was miserable for a really long time.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.947
[scoffs] Till he became Mr. Perfect.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.115
[laughs] Oh!

19:18.198 --> 19:19.825
Victor's not perfect.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.869
But I love him.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.665
He makes me laugh.
He makes me feel safe.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.878
When I think
about something bad happening to him...

19:33.255 --> 19:34.840
I get so upset. [laughs]

19:36.049 --> 19:38.051
I just can't picture my life without him.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.264
I mean, it's inevitable.
Women live longer. I'll bounce back.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.101
[sighs]

19:48.228 --> 19:50.731
I'm sorry. [laughs]
This isn't helping you feel better, is it?

19:51.940 --> 19:52.816
No.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.029
But I know what you mean.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.200
You're marrying the love of your life,
and that's really special.

20:03.118 --> 20:07.497
Victor tells me that you are dating
a really sweet guy, Mateo.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.752
Right. That guy. [laughs]

20:12.920 --> 20:14.546
I gotta text him back.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.511
-Did I miss anything?
-We were talking about the wedding.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.554
I'm available.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.183
Unless it's at the end of September.
Early spring's no good either.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.311
Oh, and I'd love to keep my summer open.
Why don't I just send you some dates?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.772
Alex, Elena?

20:33.148 --> 20:34.524
Can I count on you two being there?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.862
Papi, I'll come to all of your weddings
if you come to all of mine.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.032
Oh, my God.

20:42.115 --> 20:45.202
Well... great. [chuckles]

20:46.703 --> 20:47.871
Elena?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.292
I want to lay down some ground rules.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.670
I'm not gonna hide the fact that I'm gay.

20:56.088 --> 20:56.964
Okay.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.091
And I'm definitely going
to wear my white suit.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.260
No. No, absolutely not.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.179
I knew it.

21:04.554 --> 21:05.764
This is all a show,

21:05.847 --> 21:08.016
but you are never gonna be okay
with who I am.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.063
Elena, you can't wear the white suit
because you need to wear a tuxedo.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.856
What?

21:15.023 --> 21:18.277
I want you and Alex
to be my best man and my best woman.

21:18.986 --> 21:19.861
Best people.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.199
I mean, if Elena's cool with it.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.080
I mean,
you really want me to be your best woman?

21:33.250 --> 21:35.919
I-- I would love that. Yes. [chuckles]

21:36.920 --> 21:38.797
This is so sweet.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.590
Nepotism.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.429
Victor, what a lovely gesture!

21:45.512 --> 21:47.431
Thank you. Thank you, Lydia.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.267
I'm really happy with my life now.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.061
Turns out this whole not drinking thing
is good for me.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.230
I never doubted you.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.329
Feeling horny?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.042
Oh! [laughs]

22:22.716 --> 22:24.760
I'm sorry I was ignoring your texts.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.845
That's okay.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.098
I wanted to talk to you about something,

22:30.182 --> 22:33.310
not necessarily while you smell of tequila
returning from...

22:33.393 --> 22:34.728
Therapy.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.397
No, but...

22:37.481 --> 22:39.149
Now. Let's talk now, yeah?

22:39.232 --> 22:40.275
Okay.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.112
Well, what I wanted to say is...

22:45.655 --> 22:48.367
I started talking to my ex-wife again,

22:48.450 --> 22:51.370
and we decided to give it another shot.

22:52.996 --> 22:53.914
Oh.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.208
Oh, man!

22:57.918 --> 22:59.044
I know.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.588
No, it's because I was coming over
to break up with you.

23:01.963 --> 23:02.798
What?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.549
See, it's like this, Mateo.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.885
When I think
about something bad happening to you,

23:06.968 --> 23:08.136
I-- I don't get upset.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.597
In fact, I don't even care.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.557
Wow.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.518
Sick burn!

23:17.646 --> 23:20.399
I... That's not how I meant it.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.192
[sighs]

23:22.609 --> 23:24.069
I think you're great.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.196
And I care about you.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.408
But what we have-- had...

23:31.827 --> 23:33.495
It's nice, but it's not...

23:33.578 --> 23:34.538
Yeah.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.503
Anyway, I'm glad that
we're both on the same page.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.256
This is good.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.927
I know it might be weird at first...

23:50.804 --> 23:53.223
but eventually, do you think
we could be friends again?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.267
Of course.

23:58.645 --> 23:59.604
On one condition.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.605
What's that?

24:01.189 --> 24:03.817
If anyone at school asks, I dumped you.

24:03.900 --> 24:04.943
[laughs]

24:06.903 --> 24:07.737
[both laugh]

24:08.113 --> 24:10.115
[announcer talking on TV]

24:10.198 --> 24:12.033
-Oh.
-[TV turns off]

24:12.117 --> 24:14.369
Hey, how was it?

24:14.453 --> 24:15.871
Great. I'm gonna be the best man,

24:15.954 --> 24:18.123
and Elena's gonna be the best woman
at Papi's wedding.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.917
I'm gonna rock a tux
like Diddy at the Met Gala.

24:21.001 --> 24:21.835
Ooh!

24:22.335 --> 24:25.297
And I'm gonna rock my tux
like Jacques Dubochet.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.260
He won a Nobel Prize for chemistry.

24:30.844 --> 24:31.970
Hello!

24:32.888 --> 24:34.973
[laughing] Okay, that's great.

24:35.056 --> 24:37.392
Mami, Dr. Berkowitz called for you.

24:37.642 --> 24:41.146
Oh, right, that guy. [chuckles]

24:43.148 --> 24:44.900
I gotta text him back.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.867
So, I guess things went well.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.243
They did.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.163
It was nice to have some quality time
with the kids...

24:58.246 --> 24:59.372
and your mother...

25:00.123 --> 25:01.541
-and your landlord.
-Oh.

[chuckles]

25:04.044 --> 25:08.590
Not that you need it,
but I totally approve of Nicole.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.802
You really pulled your life together.
I'm happy for you.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.014
Thank you. Thank you.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.225
That really means a lot to me.

25:24.022 --> 25:27.025
Listen, I don't know
exactly how to say this,

25:27.108 --> 25:27.943
so I'll just say it.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.280
I don't want Schneider
around the kids anymore.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.534
What? Why not?

25:35.617 --> 25:36.576
He's drinking again.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.204
And who knows what else?

25:39.287 --> 25:42.791
No. No, no way!
No, he's eight years sober.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.835
He went to the bathroom four times,
and he smelled like mouthwash.

25:45.919 --> 25:46.878
I know all the tricks.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.258
Look, I know he's your friend,
but this is about the kids.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.009
Look into it.

25:54.719 --> 25:55.804
I'm really sorry.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.104
