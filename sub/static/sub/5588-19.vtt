WEBVTT

00:02.937 --> 00:04.094
Hey.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.802
That staycation beard's
really taking shape, dad.

00:06.807 --> 00:07.603
It's starting to trap food.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.804
Yep.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.006
It's gone from itchin' to bitchin'.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.440
And you're still rocking the sweats.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.605
Every day this week. Same underwear?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.111
What underwear?

00:15.116 --> 00:16.946
Hold that thought. Do I have to?

00:16.951 --> 00:18.948
Mayor's office. City of Phila-Dunphy-a.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.221
I'm sorry. I just got done.

00:20.262 --> 00:21.550
My computer crashed,

00:21.555 --> 00:24.153
and we got four pallets
of hinges from Taiwan

00:24.158 --> 00:25.287
with faulty riveting.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.727
At least your story's riveting.

00:26.768 --> 00:28.287
It's clever. I'll tell you later.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.192
Hey, why is the minivan in the driveway?

00:30.197 --> 00:31.457
You parked me in this morning.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.795
I was running late for a meeting,

00:32.800 --> 00:33.667
so I just took Haley's Corolla.

00:33.708 --> 00:34.997
Fun.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.198
It would be if it didn't smell like

00:36.203 --> 00:38.000
the inside of
Bob Marley's laundry hamper.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.535
Anyway, I've got
a bunch more calls to make.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.970
I'm not gonna have time to cook tonight.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.335
We could go out.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.539
There's that new restaurant -- Sliders.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.241
The gimmick is they built it on a slant,

00:45.246 --> 00:46.806
and the waiters all wear socks.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.411
That doesn't sound good at all.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.976
Can you just order something?

00:49.984 --> 00:51.584
Yeah, you got it. Great.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.387
What are you doing?
Run away, little dog.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.057
Fine. Go around you.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.691
You're not gonna move.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.325
'Cause I'm not stopping for you.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.601
I'm stopping for you.

01:07.642 --> 01:09.841
Damn. Ohh!

01:11.072 --> 01:13.107
Move it!

01:13.148 --> 01:15.707
Seriously?

01:19.947 --> 01:22.877
Don't forget you have to watch
Joe while we have company.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.218
Again? Yes, again.

01:24.259 --> 01:25.678
What is the problem?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.616
He always wants to watch his
show "Mystery Kidz," with a "Z".

01:28.622 --> 01:29.690
It's insufferable.

01:29.731 --> 01:31.187
Now you know what I felt

01:31.192 --> 01:32.927
when I had to watch your favorite show.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.256
"Masterpiece Theater"?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.130
It was hosted by a creepy puppet.

01:36.171 --> 01:37.898
That was Alan Cumming.

01:37.939 --> 01:40.528
Ay, Jay, you have to add
two more chairs.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.902
For who?

01:41.943 --> 01:43.370
It's us, the McClouds, and the Sharps.

01:43.411 --> 01:46.207
I also invited my friend Dana
and her husband, Reece.

01:46.248 --> 01:48.137
Reece? Who's Reece?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.710
I just told you. Dana's husband.

01:49.751 --> 01:51.540
I met her at the PTA lunch,

01:51.545 --> 01:54.243
and she's the only woman
in the anti-bullying campaign

01:54.248 --> 01:56.145
that I don't want to punch in the face.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.047
Why would I want
these people in my house

01:58.052 --> 01:59.148
messing up my poker game?

01:59.153 --> 02:01.150
Maybe you'll meet new friends.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.415
We've been over this before.
I don't want any new friends.

02:03.424 --> 02:06.393
I have the exact-right
number of friends.

02:06.434 --> 02:08.289
Jay, your friends have been around

02:08.294 --> 02:10.324
since before the movies could talk.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.161
I don't think it's the worst idea

02:12.166 --> 02:13.596
to start getting some backups.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
# Modern Family 7x19 #
Man Shouldn't Lie
Original Air Date on April 13, 2016

02:27.350 --> 02:29.817
Hey, daddy, what's
a lowest common denominator?

02:29.858 --> 02:31.577
- Reality TV.
- That's hilarious,

02:31.585 --> 02:32.915
but I've got a quiz tomorrow.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.818
Uh...

02:35.823 --> 02:36.857
What is that noise?

02:36.898 --> 02:38.417
Let me remind you that it's been weeks

02:38.425 --> 02:40.022
since we've had a tenant up there.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.257
So you rented it to a rock band?

02:42.263 --> 02:43.430
A Christian rock band.

02:43.471 --> 02:45.995
Oh, good. Okay, so they're
noisy and judge-y.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.297
Shame on you and your narrow,
big-city attitude.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.671
I've known many accepting
people of faith.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.468
And I've been chased into a lake.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.670
So I guess we're both
entitled to our opinion.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.535
Oh, oh, oh -- No!

02:56.544 --> 02:58.714
Okay. Guys. Absolutely not.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.677
Come in.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.379
Hey.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.481
This is Mitchell,
and the music sounds great.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.546
Just wondering if you could
turn it down a-a skosh.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.652
Yeah, of course. We're sorry.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.454
Just giving the guy upstairs
a taste of our new song.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.727
He means God. Really?

03:13.768 --> 03:15.857
There's no third floor
I don't know about?

03:15.863 --> 03:18.060
We love the place, by the way.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.725
It's just scrumptious.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.570
Good! Good!

03:22.611 --> 03:26.135
So, you guys are a Christian rock band?

03:26.140 --> 03:28.037
Water to Wine. Yeah, that's us.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.371
Well, I hope you're not expecting

03:29.376 --> 03:30.636
to bring all your groupies back here.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.008
Don't worry.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.348
The Soldiers of the Lamb Church

03:34.389 --> 03:35.844
forbids premarital relations.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.979
-Mm.
-Of course.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.180
But I can think of a few ladies

03:38.185 --> 03:39.682
I wouldn't mind multiplying with

03:39.687 --> 03:41.317
after our elders give us
their blessings.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.818
I heard that. Oh!

03:42.823 --> 03:44.758
We love girls!

03:44.799 --> 03:48.257
As long as you guys are here,
I need an outsider's opinion.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.730
I'm working on a song,

03:49.771 --> 03:51.930
but these guys think it's too soft.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.196
Do you mind?

03:54.201 --> 03:57.238
Um...lay it on us, bro.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.334
Okay.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.769
# Hiding for so long #

04:00.774 --> 04:03.877
# The real me, I don't belong #

04:03.918 --> 04:06.575
# I'm not myself, I never was #

04:06.580 --> 04:10.179
# I cry at night and all because #

04:10.184 --> 04:12.881
# I'm trapped on a secret path #

04:12.886 --> 04:15.246
# I need a holy bath #

04:15.256 --> 04:18.386
# To wash away the sins I hide #

04:18.392 --> 04:21.228
# To douse the fire I feel inside #

04:21.269 --> 04:23.225
Aw, dang it, Dex, you're bumming me out!

04:23.230 --> 04:25.360
Whoa. Calm down, Coop.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.926
Just 'cause we're in the city

04:26.934 --> 04:28.631
doesn't mean we got to talk like it.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.296
I'm so sorry.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.040
You know what, Dex, I like that song.

04:33.081 --> 04:35.209
Yeah. What's the title?

04:35.250 --> 04:38.107
I call it "A Cry for Help".

04:38.112 --> 04:40.212
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah, I'm standing right here.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.745
You're back again?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.948
Oh. Missed you, too.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.088
Sanjay's home this weekend.

04:48.129 --> 04:50.918
It's kind of a big day for us --
our first anniversary.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.159
Look what I got him.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.556
It's a hadrosaur metacarpal

04:54.561 --> 04:56.558
for his dinosaur bone collection.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.132
Too much?

04:58.173 --> 05:00.601
Well, what's the equivalent gift
if you guys were normal?

05:00.642 --> 05:02.271
Like, a Starbucks card or a Rolex?

05:03.337 --> 05:05.497
Kind of like a really nice microscope.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.802
You're not helping.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.305
I thought the gift
for a first nerd anniversary

05:09.310 --> 05:10.480
was inhaler.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.275
Hey. Where's your dad?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.680
Upstairs. Why?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.618
You got us a dog?!

05:17.659 --> 05:18.478
No, no!

05:18.485 --> 05:19.345
It's a stray,

05:19.353 --> 05:21.021
and we are not keeping him.

05:21.062 --> 05:22.251
Be quiet.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.786
Your dad cannot know he's here.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.120
If he sees him, he'll get all attached,

05:25.125 --> 05:26.622
and there's no getting rid of it.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.457
Oh, it'll be like Luke all over again.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.459
At least they were married
when they had me.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.460
You ruined mom's life.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.594
Hmm. Stop.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.797
I am now very happy I have all of you.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.699
But I just can't take care
of another living creature.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.671
Then why'd you bring it home?

05:37.712 --> 05:39.139
I couldn't leave it in the street.

05:39.180 --> 05:40.636
Claire, is that you?

05:40.641 --> 05:41.809
Take care of it.

05:41.850 --> 05:43.305
I'm not gonna kill a dog.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.610
Hide it in your room.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.382
Is that what I think it is? Uh, no.

05:48.423 --> 05:49.817
Yeah, pizza's here.

05:49.858 --> 05:50.813
Oh.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.848
How you doing?

05:53.354 --> 05:54.224
What was that?

05:55.622 --> 05:58.987
I'm the pizza monster!

05:58.992 --> 06:01.061
It's this new character I'm doing.

06:01.102 --> 06:03.859
I love it. I really love it.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.499
I didn't really love it.

06:05.540 --> 06:08.664
It felt a little close
to my Chicken Pot Pirate.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.199
It's a mystery.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.339
Who's that?

06:12.380 --> 06:15.869
Noni. She can be invisible.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.736
-Who's that?
-Gogo.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.805
He can jump off of buildings.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.979
This is the most unrealistic
show I've ever seen.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.719
Who's that?

06:25.760 --> 06:26.819
Yes, great. I will open the gate.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.190
Reece. Probably can't even work a gate.

06:30.231 --> 06:31.487
Maybe you'll like him.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.888
He's the Kings' dentist.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.562
Well, hoity-toity.
I'm the emperor's closet maker.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.498
The L.A. Kings hockey team.

06:37.539 --> 06:38.758
Kings' dentist.
Why does he say it like that?

06:38.766 --> 06:40.426
What, is he trying to be all fancy?

06:40.434 --> 06:42.534
He didn't say anything. I said it.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.700
-Hi!
-Hi!

06:44.705 --> 06:45.934
-Hello.
-Hi.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.069
Dana, Reece, this is my husband, Jay.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.165
-Hi. Jay. Pleasure.
-Hello.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.336
-Hi, Reece. How are you?
-Hey, Jay.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.040
Dana, come with me to the kitchen

06:52.045 --> 06:53.505
while the boys get to know each other.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.848
All right.

06:54.889 --> 06:56.208
Did you hear they're thinking

06:56.216 --> 06:58.013
of eliminating cursive at the school?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.048
All of it, or just the "F" word?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.722
I brought you some Scotch.

07:01.763 --> 07:03.619
Wow. That's quite a bottle. Thank you.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.020
Mm.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.623
Hey, Gloria tells me
you're the Kings' dentist.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.426
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds so hoity-toity.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.860
Why don't we crack that open?

07:11.865 --> 07:14.062
And do you have any Cohiba Robustos?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.227
Oh, I wish, but, you know,
they're impossible to find.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.534
Hmm. Well, look at that.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.469
I just found two.

07:21.442 --> 07:24.578
Okay, the guy wasn't all bad,
but I couldn't let Gloria know

07:24.619 --> 07:26.975
or it would open the door
for a whole bunch of new things

07:26.980 --> 07:28.076
I don't want to do --

07:28.081 --> 07:29.311
Trendy restaurants,

07:29.316 --> 07:31.576
movies about how women feel about crap.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.945
And who needs it?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.751
As if this week wasn't bad enough,

07:35.756 --> 07:38.816
now my hardware supplier
in Brussels is flip-flopping.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.586
Sounds like you're dealing
with a real Belgian waffle.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.557
Is that a dog?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.465
What? No.

07:48.402 --> 07:49.837
That sounds like a dog.

07:49.878 --> 07:51.397
You will do anything

07:51.405 --> 07:54.135
to avoid hearing me talk
about work, won't you?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.839
I'm -- I'm just gonna go
cool off downstairs.

07:56.844 --> 07:57.884
Yep.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.175
Honey?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.176
She is right.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.151
Sometimes I don't listen.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.315
That's what she said, right?
I don't listen?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.116
Did you get out?

08:08.121 --> 08:10.419
Oh, come on, now.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.960
Shhhhhhh. -Honey?

08:13.001 --> 08:14.628
Sweetheart? -Hmm?

08:14.669 --> 08:16.497
I am so sorry.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.697
It's fine, Phil, really.
Just go back to bed.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.967
I just...need some time to myself.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.341
Y-You know I cry when you cry.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.141
I'll be upstairs.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.478
Ohh!

08:31.519 --> 08:32.337
You okay?

08:32.346 --> 08:34.275
It's just -- It's been a lot.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.951
I love you.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
_

08:46.460 --> 08:48.629
Hey, Dex. How are you?

08:48.670 --> 08:49.897
You okay?

08:49.938 --> 08:52.294
Yeah, I was just admiring your garden.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.996
Hey, come on in.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.870
So, uh, where is the rest of the gang?

08:56.911 --> 08:58.867
Oh, they're out on a prayer jog. Ah.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.040
It's not really my thing.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.408
Oh.

09:01.449 --> 09:03.338
Is -- Is that something
that happens a lot

09:03.343 --> 09:04.978
where -- where you feel different?

09:05.019 --> 09:05.974
Hi, Dex.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.247
Hey, Mitchell. Hi.

09:07.288 --> 09:09.044
Can I have you help me over here
for just a second?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.218
Uh, okay.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.148
Ohh.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.187
What are you doing?

09:14.228 --> 09:15.684
He was clearly reaching out.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.185
He was admiring our garden.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.559
Nobody admires our garden.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.656
It's a dead cactus
with a grocery bag stuck to it.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.657
What is going on with you?

09:21.662 --> 09:22.930
You're the one who never wants

09:22.971 --> 09:24.159
to get involved in people's lives.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.360
Don't you see?

09:25.365 --> 09:26.925
He feels trapped by those guys.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.368
Oh, the big, bad Bible thumpers?

09:28.409 --> 09:29.528
Here we go again.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.266
I'm just saying you could read his song

09:31.271 --> 09:32.839
"A Cry for Help"

09:32.880 --> 09:34.107
as a cry for help.

09:34.148 --> 09:38.337
Mitchell, I'm sorry
you got chased into a lake,

09:38.345 --> 09:39.835
but some of the kindest, most loving,

09:39.846 --> 09:43.545
generous people I've ever known
were churchgoers.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.047
Just...

09:45.052 --> 09:47.187
Come --

09:47.228 --> 09:50.252
Hey, Dex, do you mind if I make
a personal observation?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.854
If it's about my hips, blame my mother.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.957
No, no.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.197
It's -- It's about the song
that you sang yesterday.

09:57.238 --> 09:59.257
It seemed like you were trying
to express something --

09:59.266 --> 10:01.026
some feelings you might be having

10:01.034 --> 10:03.437
that you think might
not be met with approval

10:03.478 --> 10:05.233
from your... "community".

10:05.238 --> 10:07.968
Or it's just a song.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.205
Has nothing to do
with his personal situation.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.778
-No, it does.
-Ha! Ha!

10:11.819 --> 10:13.375
I'm -- I'm sorry. Your pain is real.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.810
I just feel so guilty.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.045
I know people will be disappointed.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.747
No, no, don't feel guilty.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.352
Look, the first step
is to say it out loud.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.758
I don't want to be a drummer.

10:24.799 --> 10:27.723
Okay, now say the other thing.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.297
I don't want to be in a band anymore.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.227
I miss home.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.667
I miss my girlfriend.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.564
-I'm sorry. Whoa. What?
-I'm sorry. Your what?

10:35.569 --> 10:38.967
It's like a weight has been lifted.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.269
Thank you so much, guys.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.311
You know, I was just
gonna stay inside today,

10:44.352 --> 10:47.651
but I'm really glad I came out.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.118
He doesn't get to say that.

10:51.159 --> 10:52.178
Oh, hey, Joe.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.115
Uh, there's a new "Mystery Kidz" on.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.088
No, thanks.

10:55.129 --> 10:56.585
"No, thanks"?

10:56.590 --> 10:58.258
Aren't you curious who stole
Poco's magic wings?

10:58.299 --> 10:59.418
Not really.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.922
But everyone's a suspect.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.457
The watchmaker hates Poco,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.459
and Mayor Pudding would do
anything to stay in office.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.034
How could you not want
to see what happens?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.271
Hello?

11:11.312 --> 11:12.339
Uh, yes. Hold on.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.939
Jay, it's Reece.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.606
You see, Gloria? Now he's calling me.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.141
This is what I was afraid of.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.106
He called.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.710
My new friend called.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.305
He's taking me to a hockey game.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.046
Great.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.788
Now I'm stuck going to some
boring charity event with Reece.

11:27.829 --> 11:29.317
You see what your mom got me into?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.019
Jay, come on. Keep an open mind.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.234
All we're saying is give Reece a chance.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.859
Rex.

11:37.864 --> 11:38.999
Scooby.

11:39.040 --> 11:39.959
Clifford.

11:39.966 --> 11:40.896
What are you doing?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.197
Trying to figure out his name.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.231
What about dad?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.033
Here, Dad. Nope.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.735
You do not need to figure out his name

11:46.740 --> 11:48.370
because we're going
to put these fliers up,

11:48.375 --> 11:50.072
and someone's gonna call.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.374
What happened to the dinosaur
bone I got for Sanjay?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.377
I saw Snoop...

11:55.382 --> 11:57.050
burying something in the backyard.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.518
And you didn't do anything?

11:58.559 --> 11:59.715
I opened the door for him.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.516
That bone lasted 65 million years,

12:01.521 --> 12:03.657
and it can't even last
one day in this house?!

12:03.698 --> 12:05.687
-Claire.
-Oh, my God, your father!

12:05.692 --> 12:07.060
The dog -- outside! Outside!

12:07.101 --> 12:09.229
Outside! Yeah, honey?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.426
Sweetheart, about last night. Uh-huh.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.061
Because I didn't listen
with these two ears...

12:13.066 --> 12:14.262
Yes.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.697
...I want to apologize

12:15.702 --> 12:17.671
with these tu-lips.

12:17.712 --> 12:19.840
Oh, that is very --
That's so sweet of you.

12:19.881 --> 12:20.610
-Oh.
-Thank you, baby.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.271
Great.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.873
Oh, is that a tortilla chip right there?

12:24.878 --> 12:25.907
Yeah -- Oh.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.681
Hola, amigo from yesterday.

12:27.722 --> 12:28.877
You're not gonna eat that, are you?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.579
No, that would be disgusting.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.618
Oh, good. What are these?

12:31.659 --> 12:33.515
Oh, that's a -- It's a...

12:33.520 --> 12:35.188
It's a protein snack.

12:35.229 --> 12:36.384
You don't have to eat that
if you don't like it. - No.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.357
I like it. Good.

12:37.398 --> 12:38.617
It's -- It's liver-y.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.785
Ah.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.562
You take such good care of us.

12:42.603 --> 12:44.359
Thanks, honey. We should get
those flowers in a a vase.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.098
No, Phil. Oh!

12:45.139 --> 12:46.695
Not that vase.

12:46.700 --> 12:47.696
Look at me!

12:47.701 --> 12:50.537
Really look at me.

12:50.578 --> 12:51.533
I feel like I am.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.568
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.970
You're just not getting it, are you?

12:54.975 --> 12:57.773
I'm sorry. I need some alone time.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.308
Oh.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.146
Hi.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.219
Sorry for knocking on your door
so persistently,

13:06.260 --> 13:07.949
but we can't find Dex,

13:07.954 --> 13:09.489
and all his matching luggage is gone.

13:09.530 --> 13:11.119
Do you have any idea where he is?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.959
I don-- I don't know, Mitchell.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.889
Weren't you the last person
to talk to him?

13:14.895 --> 13:15.985
And we haven't got much time.

13:15.996 --> 13:16.992
If we don't have a drummer,

13:16.997 --> 13:18.326
we're gonna have to cancel the gig.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.929
Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.034
Don't even... I -- Mm.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.200
_

13:26.005 --> 13:27.135
Aah, this is devastating.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.308
If we don't play, we won't get paid,

13:28.349 --> 13:29.504
and we don't have
enough money to get home.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.805
Hey, you don't know
what Dex is going through.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.007
One hath to be true
to the way one was born.

13:34.012 --> 13:35.947
Okay, you can't just add "hath"

13:35.988 --> 13:37.407
and pretend it was in the Bible. Hmm.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.746
Well, I guess we better call
the venue and cancel the gig.

13:40.251 --> 13:42.721
Oh, boy, well, you know.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.151
I could be your drummer.

13:45.156 --> 13:46.286
Oh, God, here we go.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.988
-Really? You play?
-Swear to G-dash-D.

13:48.993 --> 13:51.329
Just play me a few bars.
I can pick it up, follow along.

13:51.370 --> 13:52.197
Oh!

13:52.238 --> 13:54.357
Mr. Cameron, thank you so much.

13:54.365 --> 13:57.995
You kind of remind me
of another special someone

13:58.002 --> 14:00.099
who made a pretty big sacrifice
to save us.

14:00.104 --> 14:01.873
Please, do not compare me to your --

14:01.914 --> 14:03.441
Mr. Bernie Kaufman, our manager.

14:03.482 --> 14:05.471
He burnt down his shoe store
to pay for our first demo.

14:05.476 --> 14:07.806
Oh. Yeah.

14:07.812 --> 14:10.048
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

14:10.089 --> 14:11.778
Oh, God, you take the dog,
and I'll clean this up, okay? Oh.

14:11.783 --> 14:14.380
Okay. Honey,

14:14.385 --> 14:15.445
I got some vase options.

14:17.388 --> 14:18.648
What happened?

14:18.656 --> 14:20.053
Um...

14:20.058 --> 14:22.055
what do you think happened?

14:22.060 --> 14:23.389
I think she saw those flowers

14:23.394 --> 14:25.530
as the shallow,
transparent gesture they were

14:25.571 --> 14:27.627
and shredded them to pieces
in a justifiable rage.

14:27.632 --> 14:29.801
Yep.

14:29.842 --> 14:31.798
What have I done to upset her so much?

14:31.803 --> 14:33.438
Maybe you should look in a mirror

14:33.479 --> 14:35.208
and ask yourself that question.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.008
Sweet Teen Wolf, what have I become?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.779
You see that guy?

14:43.784 --> 14:45.952
I have done so much work on his mouth

14:45.993 --> 14:47.921
that he's paid
for the hot tub on my boat.

14:47.962 --> 14:50.490
Hey.

14:50.531 --> 14:52.587
Did Kopitar just wave to you?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.060
It's the least he can do.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.725
I'm taking him out fishing
this weekend in Catalina.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.098
Hey, hey, do you want to come?

14:58.139 --> 14:59.795
Oh, my God, I'd love to go.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.930
Oh, but... What?

15:01.935 --> 15:04.265
Last night, before you got there,

15:04.271 --> 15:05.739
Gloria and I got in a big to-do

15:05.780 --> 15:07.836
about me not needing new friends.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.739
Oh, and now you don't want
to admit you were wrong.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.613
Wow, do you get me.

15:13.654 --> 15:16.850
Well, it's supposed to be
perfect whale-watching weather,

15:16.891 --> 15:18.346
and, uh, oh, yeah,

15:18.351 --> 15:20.520
Gretzky's coming, too. The Great One?

15:20.561 --> 15:22.417
Not at sharing the binoculars, he isn't.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.990
It's killing me I can't go!

15:24.031 --> 15:26.120
Well, here's a crazy idea.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.786
Why don't you tell your wife the truth

15:28.795 --> 15:30.425
and admit you were wrong?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.427
You don't get me like I thought you did.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.461
Or...?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.396
Fine. I'll level with her.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.801
Wow!

15:39.806 --> 15:41.266
What is going on?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.378
Ohh, good, you're not dad.

15:45.419 --> 15:47.208
So, how'd it go with Sanjay?

15:47.214 --> 15:48.849
Did he remember your anniversary?

15:48.890 --> 15:50.217
You tell me.

15:50.258 --> 15:52.447
After I gave him the fossil,
he gave me this

15:52.452 --> 15:54.821
for romantic weekends up at Stanford.

15:54.862 --> 15:56.890
It looks kind of used.

15:56.931 --> 15:58.220
Do you think it's possible he forgot

15:58.225 --> 15:59.554
and just grabbed
the first thing that he s--

15:59.559 --> 16:00.455
Shut up! He loves me!

16:00.460 --> 16:01.456
I can't believe

16:01.461 --> 16:03.191
I haven't gotten a single call.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.596
I must have put up a thousand fliers.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.131
Hey, guys.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.367
Honey.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.970
-Claire.
-Yeah.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.235
-I want to talk to you.
-Mm-hmm.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.839
I am so sorry.

16:17.844 --> 16:18.879
Mm.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.075
I don't listen.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.410
I try to solve problems with flowers.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.345
I do unflattering impressions
of you for my friends.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.587
And worst of all, I let myself go.

16:27.628 --> 16:30.385
So I shaved and put on a suit.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.519
Oh, honey.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.759
What's that?

16:32.800 --> 16:34.189
What? Oh.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.762
Um, uh... Oh, my God.

16:35.803 --> 16:36.758
You packed a suitcase.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.398
You need some time away.

16:38.439 --> 16:40.728
I guess all this was...
too little, too late.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.731
Well, not the spray tan.
That was too much, too long.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.165
I think the nozzle was broken.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.769
You're getting this all wrong,
and it's all my fault.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.610
Okay, look, I have been
trying to distract you, yes,

16:50.651 --> 16:53.675
but because I have been thinking
about what was good for me

16:53.680 --> 16:56.210
and not what might be good for you.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.546
So I have no idea

16:58.551 --> 17:00.720
if we're ever gonna find out
who his real owner is,

17:00.761 --> 17:03.285
but if we don't, you can keep him.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.087
Why would I want the Tanksley's dog?

17:06.092 --> 17:07.060
What?

17:07.101 --> 17:08.390
This is Buddy.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.385
You know the Tanksley's over on Clifton?

17:09.396 --> 17:10.356
I sold them their house.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.897
Oh, thank God.

17:11.939 --> 17:13.895
But if you're open
to me getting a pet...

17:13.900 --> 17:15.797
Yeah. Of course. Get a dog.

17:15.801 --> 17:16.897
No, I don't want a dog.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.300
I want a cockatoo to take Rollerblading.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.895
How cool would that be
sitting on my shoulder

17:19.906 --> 17:21.102
my half shirt flapping in the wind?

17:21.107 --> 17:22.436
You're not getting a bird.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.910
Are you serious? Yeah.

17:23.951 --> 17:25.478
People that have birds

17:25.519 --> 17:26.907
and walk around
with them on their shoulders --

17:26.913 --> 17:28.147
They look ridiculous.

17:28.189 --> 17:29.544
It's obviously a desperate
cry for attention.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.217
Okay.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.147
Now I need some time to myself.

17:36.890 --> 17:37.619
What are you doing?

17:38.124 --> 17:39.259
Nothing.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.389
You're watching "Mystery Kidz".

17:41.394 --> 17:43.330
You said you didn't want to.

17:43.371 --> 17:46.660
Not with you.
You ask too many questions.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.426
That's rude.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.125
I was only watching as a courtesy.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.232
What just happened?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.234
Wait, who's that?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.569
Gloria.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.443
How was the charity event?

17:56.484 --> 17:57.639
I have to talk to you about something.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.079
What?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.249
I owe you an apology.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.278
I have to go to Cleveland this weekend

18:04.284 --> 18:05.680
for my Aunt Bea's funeral.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.645
Nice old lady. Fell off a cliff.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.490
I'll -- I'll go with you.
I'll start packing right now.

18:10.531 --> 18:12.120
No, no, no. You stay here
with Joe and Manny.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.515
I'll send you a snow globe.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.186
Hey, did we have
an extra pair of binoculars?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.524
I saw a weird bird outside.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.959
Stop with the lies.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.133
I really don't understand men.

18:20.174 --> 18:22.669
Why can't you just admit
that you were wrong?

18:22.710 --> 18:24.766
It's not a weakness.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.867
It's a strength,

18:25.872 --> 18:27.807
and I would love you
and respect you more.

18:27.848 --> 18:29.267
Fine.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.635
I like Reece,
and I want to go away with him.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.113
I knew it!

18:33.154 --> 18:35.310
I was right, and you were wrong!

18:35.315 --> 18:38.645
From now on, we're gonna do
new things all the time.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.820
Tomorrow we're going
to an Ethiopian restaurant,

18:40.861 --> 18:42.517
and then we're gonna watch a movie

18:42.522 --> 18:44.858
about a love letter
that arrived 30 years late

18:44.899 --> 18:46.618
and changed the life of two women.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.190
Can I bring Reece?

18:49.195 --> 18:51.395
No!

18:52.399 --> 18:53.659
Hey, everyone, let's gather

18:53.666 --> 18:54.726
for the preshow prayer. Ooh!

18:54.734 --> 18:57.137
Kind of like Madonna
and her backup dancers.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.633
Mr. Mitchell, would you like to join us?

18:58.638 --> 18:59.998
Oh, I'm good. Thank you.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.036
All right.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.471
Heavenly Father,

19:03.476 --> 19:05.874
we ask that you make
this show super-amazing

19:05.879 --> 19:07.675
for all of our fans,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.010
and we pray for Dex.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.812
Lord, please guide him.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.746
Give him strength.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.248
And let him know

19:13.253 --> 19:16.389
that we love and accept him
no matter what.

19:16.430 --> 19:17.789
Mitchell, did you hear that?

19:19.092 --> 19:20.989
Hey, you know what? Let me in there.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.690
All right!

19:22.695 --> 19:24.925
I have -- I have been
a little judgmental, haven't I?

19:24.931 --> 19:25.660
So...

19:25.665 --> 19:27.025
Go ahead.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.730
Amen. Amen.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.365
Let's do this.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.600
-Break a leg!
-Thank you!

19:32.605 --> 19:34.102
Oh. Here.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.167
What's this?

19:35.175 --> 19:36.165
If the mood strikes you,

19:36.176 --> 19:37.236
why don't you join us onstage,

19:37.243 --> 19:38.578
make some joyful noise?

19:38.619 --> 19:40.908
Ladies and gentlemen, Water to Wine!

19:45.018 --> 19:46.118
Thank you. Hey.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.721
One, two, three, four.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.698
# The world may be flat #

19:58.739 --> 20:00.867
# But it's always changin' #

20:00.908 --> 20:03.932
# So many sins from topics
that are rangin' #

20:03.937 --> 20:06.797
# Devil's done with breakfast,
and his evil is ragin' #

20:06.806 --> 20:08.466
# Which is why #
# Which is why #

20:08.475 --> 20:10.135
# Which is why #
# Which is why #

20:10.143 --> 20:11.940
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:11.945 --> 20:13.405
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:13.413 --> 20:16.778
# Man shouldn't lie with another man #

20:16.783 --> 20:18.580
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:18.585 --> 20:19.975
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:19.986 --> 20:23.485
# Man shouldn't lie with another man #

20:23.490 --> 20:25.320
# There's a party in hell #

20:25.325 --> 20:27.555
# And the drinks are always flowing #

20:27.560 --> 20:30.290
# I think we all know the kind
of people that are going #

20:30.296 --> 20:31.993
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:31.998 --> 20:33.628
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:33.633 --> 20:37.170
# Man shouldn't lie with another man #

20:37.211 --> 20:38.638
# Unless they really love each other #
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:38.679 --> 20:41.007
# Man shouldn't lie #

20:41.048 --> 20:43.972
# Man shouldn't lie with another man #

20:43.977 --> 20:46.907
# The Jesus I know loves everyone #

20:46.913 --> 20:48.913
# Even if you're gay or straight #

20:50.116 --> 20:54.246
# Doesn't matter about
your sexuality-y-y #

20:57.500 --> 21:00.000
_

21:01.628 --> 21:02.957
I'm just saying that maybe,

21:02.962 --> 21:04.859
before you join the French resistance,

21:04.864 --> 21:06.532
you walk the 15 feet
to your neighbor's house

21:06.573 --> 21:08.630
and ask her did she get
your damn love letter.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.032
For someone that says that they
don't want to talk about the movie,

21:11.037 --> 21:12.597
that's all you seem to be talking about.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.402
I think it's better than putting
this yellow mush in my mouth.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.304
Yeah, maybe if you opened up your mind,

21:16.309 --> 21:18.479
you would see that this
is actually delicious.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.476
Mm-mmm!

21:21.981 --> 21:23.711
It was disgusting,

21:23.716 --> 21:26.276
but I could never let Jay know
that he was right.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.414
Food wasn't terrible.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.649
And if I'm being honest,

21:28.654 --> 21:30.194
the movie sort of stayed with me.
