00:05.839 --> 00:07.575
Previously on E.R.:

00:07.608 --> 00:10.044
I think I got two
cases of smallpox.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.145
We need to lock
this place down.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.246
We stood out.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.281
Where?

00:13.314 --> 00:14.282
Central Africa.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.686
Tell the C.D.C.
we have our first casualty.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.653
Am I next?

00:19.687 --> 00:20.721
Deb, Carter's right.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.822
You're quarantined
to Exam 4.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.091
You always have to be right.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.592
And you have to
be quarantined.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.228
Ah, it's not my breath
I'm worried about holding.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.262
This is my E.R.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.830
Not anymore.
Sorry, Doctor.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.632
I'm afraid the two
of you have to remain

00:31.665 --> 00:32.633
in this quarantine area.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.235
We're going to be okay.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.221
D'accord,
d'accord.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.689
Pas de probleme.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.858
Allez on-y vas.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.361

02:09.430 --> 02:10.898
Bon chance.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.998
We know
ring vaccination works.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.433
Homeland wants us to
consider city-wide.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.768
And ten people
die unnecessarily.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.570
Take a look at this!

03:22.603 --> 03:23.904
"Unnecessarily"
is debatable.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.573
Look at this!
I don't want
to debate it.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.341
It should be
a public health decision.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.977
It is.
We picked this up
from a missionary hospital

03:30.010 --> 03:31.379
300 miles east of Mbandaka;

03:31.412 --> 03:33.314
present in the
Simian population

03:33.347 --> 03:34.315
as well as 18 children.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.283
When?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.817
WOMAN:
36 hours ago.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.720
Same mutation?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.358
Jody...

03:44.392 --> 03:46.394
get me Chicago.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.798
CARTER:
You think we
can get them

03:50.831 --> 03:52.400
to move a TV in here?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.502
I think you should
catch up on your reading.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.572
CARTER:
I don't read
after midnight.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.808
There.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.942
That's a wolf.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.446
That looks like
a wolf, doesn't it?

04:05.479 --> 04:07.381
A wolf with leprosy maybe.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.883
I don't think that
you're appreciating

04:09.917 --> 04:12.986
the degree of difficulty,
even without this rash.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.021
What?

04:14.054 --> 04:15.456
Kidding.
Just kidding.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.325
This-this
doesn't look good.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.365
Maybe we're getting
early parole.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.710
You feeling okay?

04:36.744 --> 04:37.578
What is it?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.780
We need to evacuate.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.914
The E.R.?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.650
The entire
hospital.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.353
Everyone but you.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.456
( Big Ben chiming )
( London traffic sounds )

06:13.006 --> 06:16.910
MAN:
Mr. Harold Drummond was in
his usual state of good health

06:16.944 --> 06:18.546
until Tuesday evening

06:18.579 --> 06:20.981
when he began to experience
pinching in his chest.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.617
The pain seemed to intensify
throughout the day

06:23.651 --> 06:25.786
as Mr. Drummond worked
in his pet shop.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.855
After an early dinner
of pork cutlets

06:27.888 --> 06:29.923
mashed potatoes
and a couple of pints

06:29.957 --> 06:32.660
he retired to his living room
to do some reading

06:32.693 --> 06:34.027
at which point
the pain...

06:34.061 --> 06:36.029
What, we have
to guess which book?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.164
Yes, Dr. Corday?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.467
Did you treat Mr. Drummond?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.168
No.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.536
Are you certain?

06:42.570 --> 06:43.871
Because I distinctly
heard your voice.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.773
I'm sorry.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.174
Indeed. Well,
why don't we jump ahead

06:47.207 --> 06:48.742
and hear your presentation

06:48.776 --> 06:50.744
since you seem unable
to contain yourself.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.013
Uh, I'm s....
that's not necessary.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.482
( nervous chuckle )

06:57.951 --> 06:59.186
Right.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.222
Mr. McKay came into the E.R.,
complaining...

07:02.255 --> 07:05.125
We don't have "E.R.s"
in England, Dr. Corday.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.794
Excuse me.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.497
He presented
to "Casualty,"
complaining...

07:09.530 --> 07:11.665
Is Mr. McKay
the African bushman?

07:11.699 --> 07:12.666
I beg your pardon?

07:12.700 --> 07:13.867
Your patient.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.836
He's the young
black pygmy, is he?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.170
About this high?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.507
He's an accountant
from Manchester.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.041
Specifics, Ms. Corday.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.744
God is in the details.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.513
Mr. McKay is

07:25.513 --> 07:27.180
a 63-year-old
Caucasian male

07:27.214 --> 07:28.516
who was...
Man.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.083
What?

07:30.117 --> 07:34.555
I believe the noun for which
you are searching is "man."

07:34.588 --> 07:35.956
"Male" is an adjective.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.058
I have a male
Springer Spaniel.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.894
His name is Barkley,
and though I love him dearly

07:40.928 --> 07:43.030
I would never think
of bringing him to hospital.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.598
But please continue.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.601
Most of us speak
a smattering of American.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.604
( chuckling )

07:57.611 --> 07:59.547
MAN:
Where are
you taking me?

07:59.547 --> 08:00.548
WEAVER:
Mercy Hospital.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.815
Why?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.551
Because we're closing
this facility.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.252
Damn those HMOs.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.554
How many more
can you take?

08:06.554 --> 08:07.187
We're full.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.856
Then get it out of here.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.791
Call Mercy, let them know
transport's on the way

08:10.824 --> 08:13.561
and I need another
dozen rigs for O.B.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.695
Is Colin on there?

08:14.728 --> 08:15.896
No. Only
ambulatory patients.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.831
Then where is he?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.700
Yeah, I don't
think they've
brought him out yet.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.168
They said everybody's
being evacuated.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.936
And he will be.
You just have
to be patient.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.705
Lily, can you can help
find her boyfriend?

08:24.738 --> 08:25.606
Do I have to?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.274
MVA, broken pelvis.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.577
And I thought we
were getting rid of
these news helicopters.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.078
They are!

08:31.111 --> 08:33.614
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stella's one of the last ones.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.847
Zadro, you going
to Mercy?

08:34.881 --> 08:35.716
No, no, Lakeshore.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.150
Got one more for you.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.119
Where are am I supposed
to put her, on my lap?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.120
Sounds good to me,
lucky pants.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.655
How you doing
out here?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.624
Good. Third and fourth
floors are empty.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.059
I.C.U. and O.R. should
be cleared in the
next ten minutes.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.761
We did a good job today.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.130
I mean, given the situation,
it could have been a disaster

08:50.163 --> 08:51.865
but I think everyone
did really well.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.602
You kicked ass.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.769
Ow.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.004
Hold still.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.305
How come you
keep doing that?

08:58.338 --> 08:59.840
It's the way
the vaccine is administered.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.274
Yeah, you learned,
what, ten minutes ago?

09:01.308 --> 09:02.309
What are you doing?

09:02.342 --> 09:03.310
I didn't get
a wristband.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.712
They won't let me out.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.813
You need to be
vaccinated first.

09:05.846 --> 09:06.914
I did.
No, you didn't.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.015
Hey, I'll come back tomorrow

09:08.048 --> 09:09.249
and have a nurse do it,
all right?

09:09.282 --> 09:10.317
Sir, everyone has
to be vaccinated

09:10.350 --> 09:11.952
before they can leave.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.654
Hey, I'm not getting
stabbed a hundred times

09:13.687 --> 09:15.889
by some smallpox needle
if it ain't even smallpox.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.190
It's 15 little pricks, 15

09:17.224 --> 09:19.126
so shut up,
get the damn shot, and go home.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.227
Yeah, well, tell
me what it is.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.695
I'll get a shot for that.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.363
Are you deaf?
We don't know what it is.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.265
But this vaccine is
the closest thing we've got.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.635
So, if you don't want
Dr. Gallant to help you

09:27.668 --> 09:29.637
I can arrange for the army
sergeant to come in.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.183
Make sure
you don't touch that.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.317
Where are they
taking them?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.053
Upstairs.
Respiratory isolation.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.289
And why do we have
to stay in this petri dish?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.058
Prolonged exposure.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.760
Whatever that means.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.327
Did you find out
for how long?

09:54.361 --> 09:56.329
The virus is an unknown player.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.998
You said Monkey Pox.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.367
A variant of Monkey Pox.
That's the problem.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.335
How long?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.171
Two weeks.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.741
No. No, no, no, no. no. No.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.342
They promised
a public health nurse

10:09.376 --> 10:10.778
on duty, around the clock.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.912
Why two weeks?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.947
What aren't
they telling us?

10:13.981 --> 10:17.150
I don't know. I think they're
just being extra cautious.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.956
I'm sorry
about all this.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.225
Me, too.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.327
Thank you.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.299
( coughing )

10:36.103 --> 10:39.372
Could you make
any more noise, Stan?

10:39.406 --> 10:40.674
I can't help it.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.142
( wracking coughs )

10:42.175 --> 10:44.377
Well, at least
cover your mouth.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.446
You better knock
it off, Stan

10:46.479 --> 10:48.381
before you
cough up a lung.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.984
It's too late.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.156
Have you ever been
tested for T.B., Stan?

10:56.189 --> 11:01.094
D.U.I., P.C.P. and H.I.V.
but never T.B.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.229
Great.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.330
Pneumococcal
pneumonia

11:03.363 --> 11:04.732
can give you
bloody sputum

11:04.765 --> 11:05.899
fever and sweats.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.367
Have you lost any weight
lately, Stan?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.169
I've always been pretty svelte

11:09.202 --> 11:12.439
but I have had to tighten
my belt a few notches lately.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.406
Here, put this on.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.041
No. No, thanks.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.342
Do it!

11:15.375 --> 11:16.944
Oh, you don't have to be
so cranky.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.011
I'm the one with the D.T.'s.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.079
Whoa, what are
you doing?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.881
We might have
to get him tested.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.983
No, no, no,
whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, all right?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.351
They're tripping out enough

11:24.384 --> 11:25.819
and I don't need to be
double quarantined.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.453
He might have T.B.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.188
And he might not.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.489
Why don't we just take a
sputum sample to the lab

11:29.522 --> 11:30.924
do a gram stain
and an A.F.B.?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.392
Because we're not supposed
to leave.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.327
We're not contagious
unless we get a rash.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.395
No.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.897
What's he still doing here?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.365
I told you he can't
go by ambulance.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.800
That's why I got you
a chopper.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.034
Why didn't someone
tell me that?

11:41.068 --> 11:41.935
Probably already landed.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.436
We have to get up top.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.338
Colin, we're going to
take you to the roof now

11:45.372 --> 11:46.774
so we can put you
on a helicopter.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.507
I-I don't like to fly.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.209
It's a short trip.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.779
You don't understand.
I really don't like to fly.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.413
You don't have a choice.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.316
I'm serious. You take me
up there, I'll freak out.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.484
It's not a plane.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.319
It's an air
rescue helicopter.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.154
That's even worse.
A helicopter can't glide.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.422
Just take me back.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.191
Listen, I have
a bad feeling about this.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.258
Take me back!
Please!

12:05.292 --> 12:07.027
Just take me back!

12:13.266 --> 12:15.969
My son doesn't know.
I'm leaving.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.238
Well, we'll make sure
to tell him.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.406
Hold those elevator doors.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.341
Dr. Romano, Saint Rafe's says

12:21.374 --> 12:23.410
they can take one
critical, not two.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.846
That's too bad,
'cause I'm sending four.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.415
Thank you.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.351
I've never been
in a Catholic hospital.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.353
Well, you'll like
the nuns. Nice calves.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.155
They said
they'll only accept one.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.456
Tell Weaver we're clear.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.059
Sign out all the Demerol
and morphine.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.394
To who?

12:41.428 --> 12:42.963
Two.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.464
Get the hell out of here.
Hello. Who's this?

12:44.497 --> 12:46.166
You like your job?
You want to keep it?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.868
Okay, then you tell
your chief of staff...

12:47.901 --> 12:49.903
You know who that is?
Good for you.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.840
You tell Jonesy that
Robert Romano is sending over

12:52.840 --> 12:53.941
four critical patients...
Dr. Romano.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.542
...all of whom
I expect to be treated

12:55.575 --> 12:59.512
like his own mother, without
the inappropriate touching.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.326
Tidal volume's down.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.964
Probably just
the morphine.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.199
Hey! Hey!

13:19.232 --> 13:21.001
Don't even think about it.
That's my chopper.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.903
They said they were sending
a chopper for two patients.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.437
Well, it looks like
they lied.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.106
Hey, no, I don't want to go
on this helicopter!

13:26.139 --> 13:27.307
Fine, fair enough.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.608
He needs an I.C.U. bed.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.077
So get him one!

13:30.110 --> 13:31.344
He has bilateral
pulmonary contusions

13:31.378 --> 13:33.013
and they're starting
to bruise!

13:33.046 --> 13:34.982
And my boy Marty here
is a 70-year-old diabetic

13:35.015 --> 13:37.017
with gram negative sepsis
from cholecystitis.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.987
I'm only 68!

13:44.224 --> 13:46.093
Hey, get that chopper
out of our air space!

13:46.126 --> 13:47.094
My patient's going to lose
his airway.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.095
So intubate him

13:48.128 --> 13:49.262
and take him in your Viper.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.931
He's not safe
to transfer.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.900
Arguing like this isn't helping
either one of them.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.402
Oh, you know, you're right.
I'll tell you what, you can take

13:55.435 --> 13:57.270
the chopper after I'm finished
with him. Let's go.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.438
Temp's 101.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.107
All right.
Ten grams of Tylenol

14:00.140 --> 14:01.942
and piggyback the gentamicin.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.392
No vascular clamps, but we have
two kellys and a needle driver.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.928
Oh, God.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.629
Where's the arm?
Do we have the arm?

14:22.662 --> 14:24.331
I can't see
anything.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.267
Shut this thing down!
PILOT:
Not with you under it.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.468
( gagging )

14:28.501 --> 14:29.937
He's vomiting.

14:34.407 --> 14:39.947
A 20-centimeter lac over the
fifth rib, but no sub Q air.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.414
Clamp!
Which one first?

14:41.448 --> 14:42.950
The biggest one.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.684
Okay, one, two, three.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.055
Tighter! Tighter!

14:48.088 --> 14:49.356
Get your gurney out!

14:49.389 --> 14:50.958
Come on, come on.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.326
LEWIS:
I can't see anything.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.161
No, don't clamp it.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.062
What?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.129
KOVAC:
Just do it!

14:56.163 --> 14:57.497
He's lost half his volume.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.368
Try for a BP on the good arm.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.602
Okay, I got it.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.106
I'm cold.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.274
Do we have blood on the rig?

15:07.307 --> 15:09.242
NURSE:
Six units, type A.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.710
KOVAC:
We need a line.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.145
No O-neg?

15:12.179 --> 15:13.713
You asked for
type specific.

15:13.746 --> 15:18.485
Dr. Romano,
what blood type are you?

15:18.518 --> 15:21.388
( yelling ):
What blood type are you?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.589
PRATT:
No red snappers.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.025
CHEN:
Could be an inadequate sample.

15:25.058 --> 15:28.461
Sputum is loaded
with gram positive
diplococci.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.431
Pneumococcus. Told
you not to sweat it.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.500
Wait-wait,
what are you doing?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.435
It's old-fashioned
pneumonia.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.237
I'm hungry. You hungry?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.072
We're quarantined.
Put your mask back on.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.540
Come on, you can't
eat with a mask on.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.509
What do you say we
raid the cafeteria?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.244
Put your mask back on.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.179
Starve a cold,
feed a fever.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.215
Pratt. Pratt!

15:48.248 --> 15:49.616
That's my watch.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.018
I need the bag.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.185
Cycle the dynamap.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.453
How's he satting?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.022
Nothing on the monitor.
Lungs are wet.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.689
Damn it.
We're loading him.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.459
I ain't taking off
till I check out
that tail rotor.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.627
LEWIS:
He's looking
pretty shocky.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.495
He needs an OR now.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.065
I don't know if she flies at
all, much less flies safely.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.666
Okay, call down for
ground transport.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.335
No, call another chopper.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.769
Where are you
going to land it?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.439
Luka, he needs to get there
by ambulance. We need ice.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.341
NURSE:
Belly's hard as a rock;
labored resps.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.608
Okay, send our
guy downstairs.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.377
Radio dispatch--
get an orthopedic

16:17.410 --> 16:19.112
and a trauma
surgeon up here.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.122
You awake?

16:29.156 --> 16:30.657
Yeah.

16:34.627 --> 16:39.199
Monkey Pox sounds
like a video game.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.334
Or voodoo.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.203
Or VD.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.105
Lovely.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.143
What, your back itch?

16:50.177 --> 16:51.344
No.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.617
You're scratching.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.419
I am... It's probably
just psychosomatic.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.654
Want me to
take a look?
No, I'm fine.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.557
Might be a rash.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.393
Turn around.

17:06.425 --> 17:10.329
Do you think someone did this
on purpose?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.664
Does it matter?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.333
What do you mean?

17:13.366 --> 17:14.401
I mean, viruses mutate.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.469
That's what they do.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.472
We're more likely to
control bio-terrorism
than Mother Nature.

17:19.506 --> 17:23.376
Thanks, that makes me feel
a lot better.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.113
No rash.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.680
Nice tattoo, though.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.417
College. I was drunk.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.453
Is that what
I think it is?

17:33.486 --> 17:36.356
I was going through
a religious phase.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.533
My chest hurts.
I can't breathe.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.369
Crank him to 15 liters.
Don't worry, Colin.
We'll get you downstairs.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.737
What the hell's the matter
with this thing?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.405
Tachy at 115.
Where's the
helicopter?

17:52.439 --> 17:54.741
Okay, load him first.
We have to get off before you.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.344
Wait. Pressure's dropping
on 20 mikes of dopamine.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.678
Over a hundred?
Eighty-five.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.280
Susan, we have to get him down.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.748
Okay, don't
hyperventilate,
just assist.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.716
Which is
dopamine?
On the syringe pump.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.485
Tell Weaver ultrasound was clear

18:05.518 --> 18:07.354
but he could have a slow leak.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.655
We got to take everybody
to the ambulance bay.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.423
Pulse ox is 91.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.592
Okay, get it. She
might need help
tubing this guy.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.860
Health Department
refused reentry.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.528
Tell them Romano authorized it.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.829
Who's Romano?

18:16.863 --> 18:18.831
Are they coming back?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.633
Uh, yeah.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.270
Don't worry, Mr. Hersch

18:23.303 --> 18:24.771
I'm right here
with you.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.907
I hope they remembered
to call my son.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.277
He'll worry about me.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.478
What's his name?

18:31.511 --> 18:33.546
Alan.

18:35.482 --> 18:40.720
His mother wanted him
to become a doctor.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.456
I'm beginning to wish he had.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.558
What's he do?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.527
( alarm beeping )

18:50.830 --> 18:53.333
So, how often does
this happen here?

18:53.366 --> 18:55.202
Only since you came along.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.870
( laughing ):
Oh, right-- the
ying and the yang.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.539
Excuse me?

18:59.572 --> 19:01.608
The ying and the yang?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.810
You know, something good
happens, so something
bad has to happen.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.645
You are Chinese, right?

19:05.678 --> 19:09.216
Yeah. I'm just trying
to figure out what
the good part is.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.251
Oh, just say the word
and I'll show it to you.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.419
No, no, no,
pick that up.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.354
I made it.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.489
You know, it's bad
enough that you're
not wearing your mask.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.491
The hospital
is abandoned!

19:18.525 --> 19:20.427
Who are we going
to contaminate?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.462
( loud clattering )

19:24.364 --> 19:26.499
Central line kit;
two liters wide open.
Where's the O-neg?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.235
We don't keep
it up here.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.802
He's not perfusing.
Set up the level one.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.804
Pratt, blood. I need
as much blood as you can get--

19:31.838 --> 19:34.374
O-neg, packed cells
and platelets-- now.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.708
Blood bank is closed.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.509
Open it.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.510
What happened?

19:37.544 --> 19:38.478
Chen, ice.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.946
I need ice; lots of it.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.718
Mr. Hersch?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.787
Mr. Hersch?

19:49.722 --> 19:52.892
Levophed, levophed...

19:57.997 --> 19:59.866
Okay, where's the bag?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.768
Where's the bag?

20:04.337 --> 20:06.806
( frustrated groan )

20:06.839 --> 20:09.776
Okay, Mr. Hersch,
I'll be right back.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.785
( panting )

20:25.892 --> 20:28.795
Somebody! I need help!

20:46.946 --> 20:48.681
( monitor beeping )

20:48.715 --> 20:50.817
Oh, son of a bitch!

21:03.062 --> 21:04.831
Come on.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.936
Come on!

21:16.343 --> 21:18.611
( grunting )

21:27.119 --> 21:28.988
Damn it.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.833
LUTZ:
You can't open
the operating room.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.535
They're already in there.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.704
Listen, Mercy and Lakeshore
are maxed out. That's it.

21:44.737 --> 21:45.972
Yeah, maxed out is relative.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.374
I can't allow
anyone else in.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.041
Look, he's our
chief of staff.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.678
You're going to need to stop
the replantation team by force.

21:51.711 --> 21:54.381
Listen, dispatch says
to remove everyone
else to Riverview.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.548
Where the hell
is that?
Indiana.

21:55.582 --> 21:56.549
No, no.

21:56.583 --> 21:57.717
Need a hand here.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.386
What took
you so long?

21:59.419 --> 22:01.454
PILOT:
Elevator doesn't open
on the first floor.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.923
NURSE:
Sats are 89, but not
correlating. Abdomen's tense.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.425
Hey! Over here.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.759
Colin, Colin,
can you hear me?

22:06.793 --> 22:08.528
Can I ride with him?
I'm his fiancee.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.929
Get her the hell
away from me.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.698
Sir, I'm going to
need you to calm down.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.700
She's not my fiancee,
she's a freaking psycho.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.902
Gallant.
We're soul mates!

22:15.935 --> 22:17.870
She ran me off the road
into a bus.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.806
I was upset,
but I'm not now.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.873
I'll...

22:20.907 --> 22:22.575
I'll take care of you!

22:22.609 --> 22:26.078
Hey... how bad is he? Romano?

22:26.112 --> 22:28.481
Bad.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.817
KOVAC:
Retracting the deltoid.
There's the median nerve.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.485
Clean cut.
That's good, right?

22:32.519 --> 22:33.820
All right,
where do you want it?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.588
Squeeze in four units
and get a hemacue.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.156
Bradying down to 50.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.425
One mig of atropine.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.659
Break out the cart.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.628
We're going to have
to tube him soon.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.895
I think I lost a pulse.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.564
Either you did
or you didn't.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.732
Can't feel it.

22:45.765 --> 22:46.999
Okay, CPR now.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.067
Pratt, get that blood in.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.569
PRATT:
First two units are up.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.572
One milligram epi, IV push,
and FFP to follow.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.643
Is anybody out there?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.611
I need help in here.
He's crashing.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.547
Somebody!

23:00.580 --> 23:03.450
( frustrated grunt )

23:23.803 --> 23:27.607
Somebody!

23:27.640 --> 23:29.509
Damn it.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.478
( panting )

23:36.616 --> 23:40.119
Okay, come on, come on.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.021
Pick up.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.190
Pick up.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.892
COP:
Out of the way. Out of the way!

23:45.925 --> 23:47.560
WEAVER:
Donald, get in there.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.195
ANSPAUGH:
Kerry Weaver, Dr. Joe Gunn.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.063
GUNN:
Nice to meet you.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.899
He walked into the
tail rotor. What
the hell happened?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.501
He barely has a pressure.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.167
Is he in arrest?

23:55.201 --> 23:56.669
Not yet.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.638
This way. Wear your
masks at all time.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.873
Dr. Weaver! Dispatch
relayed a call from
elevator number four.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.910
Dr. Lewis needs help
with a crashing patient.
She can't get him off.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.612
Well, who's with her?
No one!

24:05.645 --> 24:06.713
Normal sinus.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.615
Good pulse.
How many units?

24:08.648 --> 24:10.149
PRATT:
Fourth almost in.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.584
ANSPAUGH:
Where are we?

24:11.618 --> 24:12.952
Amputation at
the distal humerus.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.787
Dropped his crit to 18 prior
to transfusion.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.590
Arm's on ice.
Everybody,
put a mask on.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.258
CHEN:
Hemorrhagic shock resolved

24:19.291 --> 24:21.227
with blood and epi.
Pressure's 90.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.829
I need to paralyze
and intubate.

24:22.862 --> 24:23.896
( groans softly )

24:23.930 --> 24:25.031
Hold on. He's coming around.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.666
ANSPAUGH:
What do you think?

24:26.699 --> 24:28.100
I don't know.
Above the elbow's tough.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.536
Yes or no?

24:29.536 --> 24:30.537
Maybe.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.004
Oh, God...

24:32.038 --> 24:34.273
Robert...

24:34.306 --> 24:36.275
can you hear me?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.177
Oh, I'm at County.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.861
( panting )

24:58.731 --> 25:00.199
( heavy sigh )

25:09.742 --> 25:11.077
( heavy sigh )

25:12.645 --> 25:15.982
( water running )

25:16.015 --> 25:19.619
( humming )

25:19.652 --> 25:21.888
I don't think I can
take another week.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.723
Oh, yeah.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.592
All right, up.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.726
Feels like we're
the last people

25:26.759 --> 25:27.927
on the planet.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.029
Yeah, well, if we were
I'd, uh, move into

25:30.062 --> 25:32.198
the best suite
in the Ritz-Carlton. You?

25:32.231 --> 25:35.602
Um... shopping spree.

25:35.602 --> 25:37.136
Hmm.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.739
How's it look?

25:39.772 --> 25:41.073
Ooh, hot.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.609
Really?

25:44.243 --> 25:45.712
Toe or finger?

25:45.745 --> 25:46.713
Toe.

25:46.746 --> 25:47.714
Even the big one?

25:47.747 --> 25:48.781
Yep.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.182
Arm or leg?

25:50.216 --> 25:52.685
Uh... leg.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.053
You?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.287
Definitely leg.

25:55.321 --> 25:56.656
Deaf or blind?

25:56.689 --> 25:57.890
Deaf.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.225
Ha, ha!

25:59.258 --> 26:01.127
Six, five.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.328
Okay.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.830
Would you rather lose
both your arms

26:03.863 --> 26:06.098
or your penis?
( grunts )

26:06.132 --> 26:07.066
I don't know.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.735
Well, you know

26:08.768 --> 26:10.336
you could still do it
if you had your equipment.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.938
Yeah, it'd be tough
to get chicks

26:11.971 --> 26:13.172
without arms,
though.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.007
You know,
I'll tell you the truth

26:15.041 --> 26:17.877
I don't think I could date
a chick that was missing pieces.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.946
What if she had
a really great personality?

26:21.347 --> 26:23.816
What, and really big tits?

26:26.052 --> 26:28.655
( laughing )

26:28.655 --> 26:29.889
( both laughing )

26:35.895 --> 26:38.698
What the hell is going on
in here, Stan?

26:38.731 --> 26:39.866
Hey, nice do.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.669
Frames your face better.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.871
Thanks.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.205
Yeah.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.886
Dr. Weaver.

26:59.919 --> 27:00.687
How's he doing?

27:00.687 --> 27:02.088
Could be better.

27:02.121 --> 27:05.357
The ring and long fingers
are a little dusky.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.826
Is it normal
postop erythema?

27:06.859 --> 27:08.294
( muttering ):
It better be.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.962
Well, with
the poor perfusion

27:09.996 --> 27:11.931
I'm worried the antibiotics
aren't penetrating.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.232
He's not getting
enough blood flow

27:13.265 --> 27:14.266
to the hand.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.702
Well, I can up
his Dextran

27:15.735 --> 27:17.136
but if I take him
back to the O.R.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.305
we decrease his chance
of meaningful recovery.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.207
And if not,
he could lose the whole hand.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.742
I'm thirsty.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.916
Does he have
a family?

27:29.949 --> 27:31.317
I don't know.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.886
Has anyone
else visited?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.387
No.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.389
You know him.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.390
What would he want?

27:38.424 --> 27:39.826
Robert's aggressive.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.861
I'm going to say
the arm at all costs.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.429
So I should operate?

27:43.462 --> 27:47.166
Let him wake up
from the narcotics and ask him.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.035
Well, that could
be tomorrow morning.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.737
By then,
it'll be too late.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.872
Then you wait.

27:52.905 --> 27:56.408
It's his decision,
not mine.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.178
You think they know?

28:00.146 --> 28:02.915
Pratt's clueless.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.751
Chen knows.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.286
I don't think so.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.789
Oh, no, she knows.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.891
Why, did you tell her?

28:11.924 --> 28:13.492
Where do you think I got
the condoms?

28:13.525 --> 28:14.927
( chuckles )

28:14.961 --> 28:18.364
And you know,
you were a little...

28:18.397 --> 28:20.099
loud.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.868
( chuckles )

28:21.901 --> 28:23.469
Well, uh...

28:28.107 --> 28:29.475
You're about a three.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.944
You know, I always thought I was
at least a four.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.780
It's a nice pustule.

28:33.780 --> 28:36.783
It's going to be a big scar,
I know it.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.450
You can get another tattoo.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.853
That's true.
I could get "Carter."

28:40.887 --> 28:42.121
Yeah.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.190
"Sucks."

28:44.223 --> 28:45.457
Yeah, ha, ha.

28:45.491 --> 28:46.993
CORDAY:
When I was in Chicago

28:47.026 --> 28:48.861
I'd often get
homesick for London

28:48.895 --> 28:50.296
and think about
the things I missed.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.497
Now you don't have to.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.132
Yeah, now I think
about Chicago.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.367
Yes, I heard you had a run-in
with the staff.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.103
This time
with a cardiologist?

28:57.136 --> 28:59.138
He took one of
my patients hostage.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.873
He wanted to wait
for an echo.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.842
That's not unreasonable,
is it?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.343
Ooh, someone
graffed on me.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.845
It's a small hospital.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.413
Small-minded's
more like it.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.915
And it's not America.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.517
You may have to adjust
your approach somewhat.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.453
My approach is
simply to do what's
best for the patient

29:14.486 --> 29:15.387
with a minimum amount

29:15.421 --> 29:16.388
of arse licking.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.857
Uh-oh, there's my cue.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.892
What, you're not
going to say hello?

29:19.926 --> 29:22.361
Hello.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.464
I'm really glad you're back,
Elizabeth.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.867
( chuckles )

29:28.868 --> 29:29.535
You're late.

29:29.568 --> 29:30.837
I'm sorry.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.338
I had a bowel
resection.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.405
Oh, before lunch?

29:33.439 --> 29:34.540
Lovely.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.342
I washed my hands.

29:38.577 --> 29:42.014
Do you think it's possible
to die from boredom?

29:42.048 --> 29:43.315
I don't think so.

29:43.349 --> 29:46.585
What if your mind wandered off
in a daydream

29:46.618 --> 29:49.488
and you forgot to eat
or drink for days?

29:49.521 --> 29:52.091
Then you'd die
of starvation

29:52.124 --> 29:53.592
and dehydration.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.594
Caused by boredom.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.096
Hmm.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.867
( sniffs ):
You smell something?

30:03.035 --> 30:04.470
That smells like heaven.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.605
CHEN ( laughs ):
Where did this come from?

30:06.638 --> 30:07.874
I had a friend
of mine

30:07.907 --> 30:09.075
slip it through
the window.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.843
Ah, so that's contraband pizza.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.378
Yeah, why,
you want some?

30:12.411 --> 30:13.545
Hell, yes.

30:13.579 --> 30:14.981
Ten bucks a slice.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.148
Help yourself.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.918
You didn't get any beer,
did you?

30:18.951 --> 30:20.286
I got some sodas.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.889
I take back everything I said
about you, Pratt.

30:22.922 --> 30:23.990
Really?

30:24.023 --> 30:26.025
No, but thanks
for the pizza.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.559
No, but seriously

30:27.593 --> 30:29.929
since you guys make, like,
five times what I do

30:29.962 --> 30:31.397
all donations are
greatly appreciated.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.932
Hey, I got some good news.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.133
Adam's fever broke.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.301
He's out of the woods.
Ah!

30:35.334 --> 30:36.903
Lovely, lovely.
How about a toast?

30:36.936 --> 30:37.469
To young Adam.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.938
To young Adam.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.639
And to us
for surviving the plague.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.341
Unless somebody
develops a rash

30:42.374 --> 30:43.509
in the next
six hours.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.911
Pestis Puerorum.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.278
What?

30:46.312 --> 30:47.379
The black death.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.948
It started in China.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.649
Infected Italian sailors

30:50.682 --> 30:54.586
brought the disease
back to Sicily in 1347.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.588
In the end,
25 million people died.

30:56.622 --> 30:57.957
How do you know
that, Stan?

30:57.990 --> 31:00.259
Renaissance Philosophy, 1D7.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.928
You studied philosophy?

31:01.961 --> 31:03.129
Taught it.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.430
Yeah, right.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.598
You were a teacher?

31:06.632 --> 31:07.599
Yeah.

31:07.633 --> 31:08.935
What happened?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.536
Things.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.238
Things happened.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.307
Things always happen.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.278
You know,
you're sober now.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.947
Not by choice.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.214
Well, you know

31:22.248 --> 31:23.549
you've been through
the hard part.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.117
We can get you
into a program.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.252
Get you some
counseling.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.519
I killed my daughter
in a D.U.I.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.955
There's no counseling
for that.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.656
Thanks for the pizza.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.432
Well, um,
I'm going to eat this in bed.

31:40.466 --> 31:41.700
Mmm, sounds good to me.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.634
Alone.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.103
Good night.
Good night.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.704
So, you guys want
to watch some TV?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.573
No, thanks.
Nah.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.642
All right,
pizza will be in the fridge.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.280
Kind of sad, huh?

31:54.313 --> 31:55.247
What's that?

31:55.281 --> 31:56.983
The guy was a teacher.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.985
Yeah, and he killed
his daughter.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.286
'Cause of alcohol.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.587
It happens.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.323
It doesn't have to.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.992
What are you trying to say?

32:05.992 --> 32:07.359
I just think it's sad.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.161
Why can't you just
tell me

32:09.195 --> 32:10.997
what you're trying to say?
You can talk to me.

32:11.030 --> 32:14.100
You want me
to talk to you?
Yeah.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.002
I want to help you.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.037
But not because
I'm a nice guy

32:18.070 --> 32:20.572
or because I'm
worried about you

32:20.606 --> 32:23.009
but because I want
to be with you.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.076
You want to fix me.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.111
Help you.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.612
Fix me so I'm good enough.

32:26.645 --> 32:27.613
No, I want it to work.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.281
Yeah, well, I'm not broken.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.621
Huh.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.426
Ah, Ms. Corday.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.194
I see you ordered that CT
on Mr. McKay.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.096
Yes. After 20 minutes
of chatting

32:44.130 --> 32:46.032
I came to the
same conclusion.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.534
CT confirmed dissection.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.202
So, you're, uh,
carrying on

32:50.236 --> 32:51.437
all right, then,
are you?

32:51.470 --> 32:52.604
Carrying on.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.106
Of course.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.042
I suppose you can still grieve
on the inside.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.109
While I'm certain
that's meant

32:57.143 --> 32:58.710
as some kind
of a criticism

32:58.744 --> 33:00.446
I'm afraid I
haven't got time
to decipher it.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.048
You're not
in black dress.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.250
Well, in fact,
you're not in a dress at all.

33:04.283 --> 33:07.319
Perhaps America has confused you
in more ways than one.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.654
Interesting.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.289
Yes.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.725
I thought I might suggest
you reconsider that tie

33:13.759 --> 33:17.363
as it makes you
look like a boorish,
virulent ponce.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.764
But now I realize

33:18.797 --> 33:20.766
that's simply your
general disposition

33:20.799 --> 33:23.635
so it would be out
of place for me
to comment.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.172
Out of place, indeed.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.706
Tragic, really

33:27.739 --> 33:32.378
a woman out of place
on two continents.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.784
Congratulations.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.152
Excuse me?

33:40.186 --> 33:41.453
They sold your house.

33:41.487 --> 33:45.091
10,000 more
than the asking.

33:47.159 --> 33:52.698
If you sign it,
I'll fax it back for you.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.401
( quietly ):
Thank you.

34:02.574 --> 34:07.113
I would like to read
it myself, thank you.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.844
What's wrong with your lunch
today, Dr. Romano?

34:38.877 --> 34:41.547
Your body needs nourishment
to heal itself.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.449
That's brilliant.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.385
Teach you that
in nursing school?

34:46.418 --> 34:50.289
If you don't eat,
I'm going to tell Dr. Gunn.

34:50.322 --> 34:51.489
Oh.

34:51.523 --> 34:52.591
Go ahead, tell Gunn.

34:52.623 --> 34:55.694
I've seen his work.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.164
your prosthetics department come
fit me for a hook.

34:58.164 --> 35:01.267
I'll see if I can find you
something else.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.234
Uh-huh.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.635
( knock at door )

35:03.669 --> 35:05.271
Kerry.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.806
I wondered when
you were going
to visit me.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.210
Well, I was here yesterday
and the day before.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.911
You were a little out of it.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.281
Are you carpeting
my office?

35:15.314 --> 35:17.883
How are you feeling?

35:17.916 --> 35:20.586
I've been better.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.255
The surgery went well?

35:23.289 --> 35:24.856
Oh, yeah. So they say.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.493
But you know how surgeons lie.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.395
You were lucky.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.597
( laughs )

35:31.630 --> 35:33.632
Lucky?!

35:33.665 --> 35:35.867
Look, your people rallied around
to save you

35:35.901 --> 35:37.369
in a deserted hospital.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.405
If it wasn't
for Dr. Kovac, you'd...

35:39.438 --> 35:40.406
I'd still have my arm.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.373
You do still have your arm.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.374
Do I?

35:42.408 --> 35:43.809
Yes. It was a clean cut above...

35:43.842 --> 35:45.577
I signed the third quarter
income projections.

35:45.611 --> 35:46.578
You know what?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.314
We should evacuate the hospital

35:48.347 --> 35:50.349
once every year
for the money
we're saving.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.383
Robert...

35:51.417 --> 35:52.851
Going to sleep now.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.422
Apparently, I
need my rest.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.499
Identified the terminal ileum.

36:07.533 --> 36:08.767
Bovie.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.370
We call it electrocautery,
Elizabeth.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.471
Can I help you?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.340
A solo
hemicolectomy?

36:14.373 --> 36:15.607
Not by design.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.676
Your Professor Whitehead decided
to be tardy.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.378
Yes, I know.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.780
He's apparently saving
a motorist on the M1.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.382
Asked me if
I'd fill in.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.284
But it seems you've
already started.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.353
Transverse incision.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.554
Splendid.

36:28.587 --> 36:31.357
It allows for a more
localized approach.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.458
Yes, and a
bloody one.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.625
Suction?

36:33.659 --> 36:35.327
The field is clear.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.529
Let's just take
a look, shall we?

36:38.730 --> 36:39.831
Elizabeth?

36:39.865 --> 36:41.267
( sighs )

36:41.300 --> 36:43.335
Be my guest.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.004
Mm-hmm.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.373
Oh.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.541
Good separation
around the Toldt.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.843
The areolar tissue
could use

36:51.877 --> 36:53.612
better division,
couldn't it?
Metzenbaum.

36:53.645 --> 36:54.846
May I continue now, please?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.283
The more I see...

36:57.283 --> 36:58.950
the better he'll do.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.419
Well, if you merely wish

37:00.452 --> 37:02.354
to peer
around this gentleman's anatomy

37:02.388 --> 37:04.356
why don't you crack open
his skull while you're at it?

37:04.390 --> 37:05.891
No. I'm interested

37:05.924 --> 37:08.327
in completely excising
this gentleman's cancer.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.429
Thank you.
Vascular clips.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.664
Okay, then, he's all yours.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.301
Retract the
cecum medially.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.304
Retraction.

37:18.337 --> 37:21.440
Retraction.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.874
Well, you heard him.
Retraction.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.009
Watch the pericolic gutter.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.444
He's had a couple

37:25.477 --> 37:27.446
of adhesions
from an appendectomy.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.458
Good morning, Frank.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.627
Uh, welcome back,
Dr. Weaver.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.528
They waxed the floors.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.330
Yeah. Nice, huh?

37:44.330 --> 37:46.598
Takes smallpox for
them to finally
sanitize the place.

37:46.632 --> 37:47.733
It wasn't smallpox, Frank.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.868
Yeah. Mutated
monkey scabs.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.069
Whatever.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.371
Other departments on line?

37:52.404 --> 37:53.772
ICU and Surgery
have been up

37:53.805 --> 37:55.407
since midnight.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.008
Peds, PICU, Labor and
Delivery opened with us.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.410
Everybody else
starts at noon.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.478
Dr. Pratt.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.512
See ya.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.713
Disease control
clear you?

38:01.747 --> 38:03.849
100%. Probed in every which way

38:03.882 --> 38:04.983
you can think of.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.518
I don't need
to hear the details.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.919
Did we get all
our monitors back?

38:07.953 --> 38:09.455
IMEDS, propacks,
and portable vents.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.722
Crash carts are stocked
and ready.

38:10.756 --> 38:11.790
Oh, I don't get it.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.359
We're closed for two weeks

38:13.359 --> 38:14.660
and they make us come back
at 6:00 a.m.?

38:14.693 --> 38:17.629
Well, it could
have been midnight.

38:17.663 --> 38:18.997
I'll catch you
quacks later.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.065
Oh, I see you're better.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.433
I was never that bad.

38:21.467 --> 38:22.968
Told you guys
not to sweat it.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.770
Dr. Pratt, Dr. Gallant
called in sick.

38:24.803 --> 38:25.837
I need you

38:25.871 --> 38:27.072
to cover for
him until 3:00.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.440
What?

38:28.474 --> 38:29.708
Well, you just said
you felt good.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.410
Yeah, I know,
but come on, man.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.411
Eh...

38:32.444 --> 38:34.380
Kidding, Pratt.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.981
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
See you next week.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.483
Dr. Weaver, can you sign this?

38:37.516 --> 38:38.417
What is it?

38:38.450 --> 38:39.451
My timecard.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.853
Two straight weeks
of overtime.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.855
Do you think I'm kidding?

38:43.889 --> 38:45.757
Dermatologically clear.

38:45.791 --> 38:46.925
Afebrile.

38:46.958 --> 38:47.793
Okay, you're free to go.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.595
What? No psych consult?

38:49.628 --> 38:51.697
We try not to
inflict too much
long-term damage.

38:51.730 --> 38:55.567
Oh, well,
she was borderline anyway.

38:55.601 --> 38:56.668
Hey, can you tell us?

38:56.702 --> 38:57.869
What?

38:57.903 --> 38:59.938
If the virus was engineered
or natural?

38:59.971 --> 39:01.006
The system worked.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.408
Everyone did their jobs.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.442
Especially at
the local level.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.576
You're not going
to tell us.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.445
See you later, Deb.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.513
Yeah, it was
fun, Carter.

39:07.546 --> 39:08.814
Let's get these beds made up

39:08.847 --> 39:10.148
so we're not setting up
as we go.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.550
Chuny, are you triage?

39:11.583 --> 39:13.084
Yes. On my way.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.586
Hey, you survived.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.121
Hi. You look tan.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.123
I went to Barbados.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.124
Sorry.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.692
Barbados!

39:20.726 --> 39:21.860
I had two weeks.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.429
What else was I supposed to do?

39:23.429 --> 39:24.530
Frank, what time is it?

39:24.563 --> 39:25.897
5:59.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.065
Okay.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.134
We're open.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.450
( phone ringing )

39:44.483 --> 39:46.552
E.R.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.210
They just get out
themselves?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.145
He has to leave
the trach in
for a few days

40:14.179 --> 40:16.147
but he's off
the vent.

40:16.181 --> 40:18.049
They look better--
the parents.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.453
Well, maybe they
stopped blaming
each other.

40:23.154 --> 40:24.222
Weird.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.791
What?

40:25.824 --> 40:27.826
Stuck here two weeks,
I don't want to go home.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.762
Want to get some breakfast?

40:30.796 --> 40:32.063
No.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.101
You're not thinking
of jumping?

40:37.803 --> 40:39.705
No.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.206
Not quite that
desperate.

40:41.239 --> 40:42.207
Can I join you?

40:42.240 --> 40:44.142
It's your hospital.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.144
Yes, it is, isn't it?

40:48.279 --> 40:51.917
So, what's wrong
with the surgical lounge?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.885
Habit, I suppose.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.488
At County, we
often go up
on the roof

40:56.522 --> 40:58.624
when the place gets
too much for us.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.026
Oh, I'm glad
everything there isn't perfect.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.862
I was beginning to develop
an inferiority complex.

41:03.895 --> 41:06.164
Far from it.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.534
Homesick then?

41:10.969 --> 41:13.071
Yes, you do.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.106
What?

41:15.140 --> 41:16.675
Have a home.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.545
Can't bring yourself
to sell it, I understand.

41:21.212 --> 41:25.951
I assume Mr. Cummins
survived his hemicolectomy

41:25.984 --> 41:27.218
without further
incident.

41:27.252 --> 41:30.121
We do seem to manage here
from time to time.

41:35.561 --> 41:37.228
So, you haven't developed
vertigo yet

41:37.262 --> 41:38.697
in your teenage years.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.567
It reminds me
of your tree-climbing days.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.202
The head mistress couldn't
get you out of that sycamore

41:44.235 --> 41:45.236
to save her life.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.905
I had to drive
all the way down

41:46.938 --> 41:47.839
to Tunberidge Wells.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.575
( laughs )

41:49.575 --> 41:51.242
A counselor was brought in.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.244
Suggested some kind
of rebellion.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.112
Separation anxiety.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.581
A cry for attention.

41:55.614 --> 41:56.848
What have you.

41:56.882 --> 41:59.084
Turned out
you just liked climbing trees.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.586
I knew that.

42:00.586 --> 42:03.922
You were an unbridled spirit
from the womb.

42:06.925 --> 42:09.294
I don't know
what to do.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.733
I know, darling.

42:14.766 --> 42:16.134
I know.

42:18.937 --> 42:21.206
( sighs )

42:31.683 --> 42:33.785
Here.

42:33.819 --> 42:34.953
Let me.
Oh, thank you.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.254
Uh, this is the
right train

42:36.287 --> 42:37.288
for Heathrow,
isn't it?

42:37.322 --> 42:39.324
I hope so.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.328
You off for holiday?

42:43.361 --> 42:45.964
No. We're going home.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.232
CONDUCTOR:
Stand clear

42:47.265 --> 42:48.667
of the doors, please.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.736
This train is about to depart.

42:50.769 --> 42:54.172
ANNOUNCER:
The 7:59 train from Eeling
and Broadway to Redding West

42:54.205 --> 42:56.207
is now departing for Heathrow.

43:03.882 --> 43:06.652
CARTER:
Chaos theory.

43:06.652 --> 43:07.986
LOCKHART:
Chaos theory?

43:08.019 --> 43:10.055
Yeah. A virus
mutates in
the Congo.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.057
We evacuate an
ER in Chicago.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.259
Romano gets his
arm cut off.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.194
You lost me.

43:16.227 --> 43:19.230
Seemingly random
events, all part of
a larger equation.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.866
I'm hot.

43:20.899 --> 43:22.834
You know, a butterfly
flaps its wings in China

43:22.868 --> 43:25.036
and creates a tornado
halfway around the world.

43:25.070 --> 43:26.071
Are you hot?

43:26.104 --> 43:27.806
I'm just saying

43:27.839 --> 43:29.307
that's there's an inherent
unpredictability

43:29.340 --> 43:31.943
about everything--
evolution, life.

43:31.977 --> 43:34.279
Love, relationships.

43:34.312 --> 43:35.847
So, what am I?

43:35.881 --> 43:38.216
The butterfly
or the tornado?

43:38.249 --> 43:40.218
No, you're chaos
in general.

43:40.251 --> 43:41.820
Oh. Thanks.

43:41.853 --> 43:43.388
No, I'm just saying,
you're chaos to me.

43:43.421 --> 43:44.890
The unknown.

43:44.923 --> 43:46.291
I'm chaos to you.

43:46.324 --> 43:49.327
You are hardly chaos, Carter.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.896
I'm just saying
that there's a risk

43:50.929 --> 43:52.263
in anything that you do, right?

43:52.297 --> 43:53.865
But don't you want
to stack the odds

43:53.899 --> 43:56.234
in your favor?

43:56.267 --> 43:58.269
I mean, I'm drawn to you.

43:58.303 --> 43:59.370
It's kind of that simple.

43:59.404 --> 44:01.406
I've been... drawn to you

44:01.439 --> 44:03.308
for two years, but

44:03.341 --> 44:07.245
chaos always seems to rule,
and I don't want it to rule.

44:07.278 --> 44:09.414
I want to know
where it's taking me.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.982
You know what I mean?

44:11.016 --> 44:13.919
Nope.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.256
The tornado.

44:18.289 --> 44:19.825
Definitely the tornado.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.862
Are you coming in?

44:24.305 --> 44:30.505
