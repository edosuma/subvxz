21:58.491 --> 21:59.840
I didn't mean
to overstep.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.146
Yes, you did, because
you're a snooper.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.453
You're always snooping.

22:04.497 --> 22:08.109
[laughs]
You're seriously not gonna
tell me what all this is?

22:08.152 --> 22:09.719
We've been living together
for over a month,

22:09.763 --> 22:10.764
and I haven't learned

22:10.807 --> 22:12.374
a single new
thing about you.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.854
Now this.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.464
Who are you, Russ?

22:15.508 --> 22:16.987
Who am I?
[chuckles]

22:17.031 --> 22:19.468
I'm the chap
who wakes up every morning

22:19.512 --> 22:21.165
and asks himself in rapture,

22:21.209 --> 22:23.733
"What wonderful things
will I accomplish today?"

22:23.777 --> 22:25.996
Salvador Dalí said that--
also a fabulous chap.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.650
You know, most people
probably don't notice,

22:27.694 --> 22:28.999
because you
are constantly talking,

22:29.043 --> 22:30.523
but you really are very good

22:30.566 --> 22:32.133
at not revealing anything
about yourself.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.743
It must be exhausting for you.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.484
And I don't know anything
about you, either,

22:35.528 --> 22:37.921
and it's been absolutely
hunky-dory all these years.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.141
And now here you are,
suddenly changing the rules,

22:40.184 --> 22:41.751
expecting me to hop to it,

22:41.795 --> 22:43.579
when we both know
that this little tryst of ours

22:43.623 --> 22:46.147
was never meant to last more
than two days at a time, was it?

22:46.190 --> 22:47.496
No, I suppose not.No.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.412
What are you doing?Putting you...

22:50.456 --> 22:51.718
on a jet home.

22:51.761 --> 22:52.893
[gasps softly]There you are.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.461
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.114
I'll make my own arrangements.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.517
Is there any reason
why somebody would have

23:08.561 --> 23:09.953
a problem with your son?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.825
[quietly]:Uh, like, does he
owe anybody money?

23:11.868 --> 23:14.480
Oh, no, no,
nothing like that.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.699
I told you, James
has a family

23:16.743 --> 23:19.659
and he runs a professional
cleaning business.

23:19.702 --> 23:23.053
Yeah, we just give them
what they want,

23:23.097 --> 23:24.751
and then
they'll let us go, and...

23:24.794 --> 23:26.796
his partner will let James go.Yeah.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.538
Did one of you order
that package?

23:32.019 --> 23:33.542
No.No.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.544
Then I'm sorry, but...

23:35.588 --> 23:37.546
that man has plans
to kill you both

23:37.590 --> 23:39.069
and dispose of your bodies.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.637
Ooh.Which likely means

23:41.681 --> 23:42.725
the same for your son.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.641
What do we do?

23:45.685 --> 23:46.729
MALLORY:
His partner calls

23:46.773 --> 23:47.991
at the top
of every hour

23:48.035 --> 23:49.776
to check in.

23:49.819 --> 23:52.561
So if we wait until
right after the next phone call

23:52.605 --> 23:54.911
to overpower him, it'll
give us enough time

23:54.955 --> 23:57.871
to get help for James
without anybody noticing.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.222
MacGYVER:
20 minutes it is.

24:01.265 --> 24:03.224
[typing][computer beeping]

24:03.267 --> 24:05.139
Here.

24:06.967 --> 24:09.230
He went back
to the Krengels. Why?

24:09.273 --> 24:11.537
Check that same angle
two nights ago.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.582
When you thought you saw Krengel

24:13.626 --> 24:15.584
attacking someone.

24:18.021 --> 24:21.024
I told you. I told you
something shady was going on!

24:21.068 --> 24:22.678
But you were
all like, "Bozer,

24:22.722 --> 24:24.158
stop being so paranoid."

24:24.201 --> 24:25.812
His name is Shane Steckler.
Works as a bouncer

24:25.855 --> 24:28.118
at the Crawl Club...

24:28.162 --> 24:30.773
a laundering front for the
Santos Grises Motorcycle Club,

24:30.817 --> 24:31.948
until he was laid off

24:31.992 --> 24:33.559
after the shutdown.

24:33.602 --> 24:34.821
Come on.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.171
Okay.

24:37.214 --> 24:40.696
You guys have...

24:40.740 --> 24:42.002
lived here a long time.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.307
LENNY:
We got married the day

24:43.351 --> 24:45.701
I came back from Vietnam
in one piece.

24:45.745 --> 24:49.139
That was, uh... 1972.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.751
1973, Lenny.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.230
Mm-hmm.Although

24:53.274 --> 24:56.146
no one in this neighborhood
accepted a couple

24:56.190 --> 24:57.713
like us with
open arms

24:57.757 --> 24:59.236
at the time either.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.892
The only real friends we
had here were your grandparents.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.720
You knewmy grandparents?Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.680
They'd-they'd have us over
for dinner on their back deck.

25:07.723 --> 25:09.725
[chuckles softly]The world
must've been

25:09.769 --> 25:10.987
far less complicated back then.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.163
Well...

25:13.207 --> 25:15.339
I've been walking

25:15.383 --> 25:17.690
this old earth for 74 years,

25:17.733 --> 25:19.866
and it seems that...

25:19.909 --> 25:22.608
it's been a mess
the entire time.

25:22.651 --> 25:27.961
But I guess in the end
it's what you make of it...

25:28.004 --> 25:30.180
who you make it with.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.834
[chuckles]

25:34.141 --> 25:36.317
LENNY:
Who's that?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.187
My friends.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.928
[Lenny groans]

25:38.972 --> 25:41.191
They can't do anything
before the next phone call.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.542
MacGYVER:
You're right.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.208
LENNY:
What are you doing?
The phone is broken.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.254
[dial tone]

26:03.823 --> 26:04.911
Just because it's broken

26:04.954 --> 26:06.042
doesn't mean it isn't useful.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.705
[phone ringing]

26:16.749 --> 26:18.098
Oh, Riley!

26:18.141 --> 26:19.665
It's Morse code.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.319
W. A.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.888
I. T. "Wait."For what?

26:25.932 --> 26:27.020
I think Mac wants us to.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.109
[phone rings]SHANE:
Yeah?

26:30.414 --> 26:32.068
No, it's all good.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.243
Okay, just...

26:33.287 --> 26:34.941
let me know.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.208
[grunting]

26:47.954 --> 26:49.259
BOZER:
Mac!
[sighs]

26:49.303 --> 26:51.261
Bozer...

26:51.305 --> 26:53.133
hey, man, you were right,
I've been a real jerk lately.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.395
BOZER:
Look, it's okay,
all right?

26:54.438 --> 26:55.744
Something about all
of this tells me

26:55.788 --> 26:56.745
we should sidebar
that till later.

26:56.789 --> 26:57.659
MacGYVER:
Right.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.139
Riley, can you check

26:59.182 --> 27:00.880
the last incoming call
on this phone

27:00.923 --> 27:02.272
when you get a chance?

27:02.316 --> 27:05.101
His partners
are holding their son hostage.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.102
[Bozer dialing]

27:06.146 --> 27:08.104
Oh. Hey, Krengels.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.279
Hello.
Hi.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.325
BOZER:
Matty? Hi. Uh, so,

27:11.368 --> 27:13.936
we kind of need you to send
locals to pick up a suspect.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.285
And maybe get a tac team
suited up.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.852
RILEY:
All right.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.898
Well, the call came in
from a burner phone,

27:18.941 --> 27:20.682
so no I.D.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.424
GPS puts them at a Anaheim
shopping center 40 minutes away.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.861
Wai-Wait a second. Your-your son
has a cleaning company--

27:25.905 --> 27:27.689
do they do malls?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.473
Ever since COVID, they've
done just about everything.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.040
You were the leverage.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.999
His partners are using
your son's cleaning crew

27:33.042 --> 27:34.957
as a disguise, so
that they can ransack

27:35.001 --> 27:36.829
an empty mall.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.874
[sighs]
And then they're gonna kill him.

27:45.054 --> 27:48.362
MATTY:
CCTV of James Krengel being
forced into the trunk of a sedan

27:48.405 --> 27:51.017
confirms that he was abducted
the same day

27:51.060 --> 27:53.454
that Shane Steckler took
your neighbors hostage.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.848
TAYLOR:
For the last two days, while
the Krengels were being held,

27:55.891 --> 27:57.414
his coconspirator used
his son's cleaning crew

27:57.458 --> 28:00.809
as cover to rob a spree
of high-value storefronts.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.985
Businesses want to disinfect
during shutdown,

28:03.029 --> 28:05.335
so these guys have access
to all the merchandise.

28:05.379 --> 28:07.381
And with the stay-at-home order
in effect,

28:07.424 --> 28:09.992
nobody would have noticed
the Krengels missing for weeks.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.341
The robbers still don't know

28:11.385 --> 28:12.995
that Steckler's
out of the game, but...

28:13.039 --> 28:15.737
the second they make
another check-in call...

28:15.781 --> 28:16.869
That window closes.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.305
MATTY:
Which means you only have

28:18.348 --> 28:20.394
30 minutes to rendezvous
with Desi at the mall

28:20.437 --> 28:22.396
and extract James Krengel
and his crew.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.180
You wanted a mission.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.486
I did want a mission.

28:25.529 --> 28:27.227
RILEY:Well...Yes, you did.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.359
Matilda...

28:29.403 --> 28:31.797
if you send the, uh, the
helicopter now, then I can be

28:31.840 --> 28:34.234
with the team in an hour.And do what, Russ?

28:34.277 --> 28:36.932
In an hour, this will all
be over, one way or another.

28:36.976 --> 28:40.893
Well, then I can go to, um,
Phoenix and prep the debrief.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.548
You messed things up
with your "friend," didn't you?

28:44.592 --> 28:47.290
[laughs]:
What? What are you...?

28:47.334 --> 28:48.378
Russel Taylor,

28:48.422 --> 28:50.119
listen to me carefully.

28:50.163 --> 28:53.209
Any woman that could stand
being shacked up with you

28:53.253 --> 28:55.951
for 30 days, in my book,
is a saint.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.518
So whatever dumb thing you did,

28:57.561 --> 28:59.825
I suggest you go fix it
right now,

28:59.868 --> 29:02.436
or you're gonna die alone
in that big house of yours.

29:02.479 --> 29:05.047
Mm-kay? Bye.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.440
[tires screech]

29:07.484 --> 29:09.791
Pretty sure I just broke
the land-speed record

29:09.835 --> 29:11.314
on an L.A. freeway.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.012
[chuckles]:
Yeah. Only part of quarantine

29:13.055 --> 29:14.840
I could actually
get used to.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.232
Uh...
Like...

29:16.276 --> 29:18.452
You know what?
There.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.107
RILEY:
Guys,

29:21.150 --> 29:22.456
check it out--
security cameras show

29:22.499 --> 29:24.284
12 cleaners spread
throughout the mall.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.547
But in those suits and masks,
how do we tell the robbers

29:26.590 --> 29:27.853
from the legitimate cleaners?Neutralize first,

29:27.896 --> 29:28.984
ask questions later.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.116
And remember,
let's keep it quiet.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.465
We don't want
to alert the robbers

29:31.508 --> 29:33.075
before we're ready--
they could hurt James.

29:36.035 --> 29:38.211
[electronic whirring]

29:46.567 --> 29:48.090
[grunting]

30:00.146 --> 30:01.451
[camera clicks]

30:01.495 --> 30:02.626
Great.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.324
[clicks]

30:05.325 --> 30:06.805
[clicks]Okay.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.808
[clicks]Well, you look frightened.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.376
Those are all members
of Krengel's crew.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.030
Clock's ticking.
You need to split up

30:15.074 --> 30:17.293
and cover more ground.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.819
[grunting]

30:23.517 --> 30:24.997
Guess I found the lookout.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.307
[game bell dinging]

30:32.221 --> 30:34.354
I can't hit my parents,
but I can hit you.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.588
[pinball machine
sound effects playing]

30:56.680 --> 30:58.073
[bell dings]

30:58.117 --> 30:59.640
What store are they hitting?

30:59.683 --> 31:01.120
I don't know.

31:01.163 --> 31:02.556
Well, this WAM hammer
thinks you do.

31:03.252 --> 31:04.993
The jewelry store.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.212
Was that so hard?

31:11.391 --> 31:15.351
Good friend of mine told me I
was acting like a bit of an ass.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.352
She was right.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.528
Don't want you to go.

31:18.572 --> 31:22.228
The research you found
in my room...

31:23.446 --> 31:26.449
...was very, um,
personal to me, very private.

31:27.755 --> 31:30.410
When the Spanish conquistadors
invaded Peru in the 1500s,

31:30.453 --> 31:32.499
they plundered
the Incan treasure

31:32.542 --> 31:36.242
and melted it into various
daggers, axes, spears...

31:36.285 --> 31:37.591
Then, during World War II,

31:37.634 --> 31:39.332
the treasure was stolen
by the Nazis.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.073
I know the story.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.901
What does that have to do
with you being such a wanker?

31:44.250 --> 31:45.425
Never knew my father.

31:45.468 --> 31:48.254
My mother spent most of her time

31:48.297 --> 31:50.212
trying to make ends meet,
and I was practically raised

31:50.256 --> 31:51.257
by my Peruvian grandfather,

31:51.300 --> 31:53.215
who spent...
[sighs]

31:53.259 --> 31:56.305
well, most of his time filling
my head with fantastical tales

31:56.349 --> 32:00.135
about Atahuallpa
and the lost Incan treasure.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.094
We fantasized
about finding it one day

32:02.137 --> 32:04.009
and all the things
that we would buy.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.576
All the ways
it would change our lives and...
