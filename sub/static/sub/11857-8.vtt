WEBVTT

00:36.166 --> 00:38.709
Tell mama I'm goin' to play.

00:38.792 --> 00:41.083
You better be home before
the streetlights come on,
girl.

00:46.583 --> 00:50.083
Fireflies turn into fairies
at the end of summer.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.834
Why fairies?

00:51.917 --> 00:54.458
'Cause, they do.

00:54.542 --> 00:55.875
You made that up.

00:55.959 --> 00:58.250
You never see fireflies
in the winter, right?

00:58.333 --> 01:00.625
In Brooklyn,
we never saw them ever.

01:00.709 --> 01:02.959
'Cause they turn
into fairies, that's why.

01:03.041 --> 01:05.333
Yeah? And go where?

01:05.417 --> 01:09.083
Their castle in the sky,
where nothing ever dies.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.792
- But not all fairies make
it.
- Why not?

01:11.875 --> 01:14.625
'Cause the trolls catch 'em.

01:14.709 --> 01:17.959
Where do the
fireflies
really go, Melanie?

01:18.041 --> 01:19.709
I don't know.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.667
My brother said when summer ends

01:25.750 --> 01:27.125
you won't play with me anymore.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.542
Why?

01:28.625 --> 01:31.500
'Cause you're white,
and I'm black.

01:31.583 --> 01:34.125
But we're best friends.

01:34.208 --> 01:37.000
- Forever?
- Forever and a day.

01:37.083 --> 01:40.583
Maybe when summer ends,
the fireflies go to heaven.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.333
Yeah, maybe.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.375
Let's get forensics in here,
see
if they can pick anything up.

02:28.458 --> 02:29.500
Lil'.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.917
Good morning, boss.
What do you got?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.208
You ever hear of a
letter
arriving 31 years too
late?

02:35.291 --> 02:36.375
Too late for what?

02:36.458 --> 02:38.625
To save the life
of a young girl.

02:38.709 --> 02:39.917
Former postman lived here?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.375
And he died last week.

02:41.458 --> 02:44.959
Refused to deliver mail to
blacks on his route back in
'75.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.583
Welcome to
the US Postal Service.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.458
His family found bags of
mail
stashed in the basement.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.959
The inspector's
been
sifting for hours.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.750
This was in one of 'em.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.166
From an eight-year-old
girl,
Melanie Campbell.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.709
Went missing in '75.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.875
Body never found.
Presumed homicide.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.417
'Postcard's addressed
to her best friend'

03:02.500 --> 03:05.667
'next door neighbor,
Cherise Pierce, black girl.'

03:05.750 --> 03:06.667
'Take a look.'

03:06.750 --> 03:08.625
"The trolls got me."

03:08.709 --> 03:10.375
Some kind of message?

03:10.458 --> 03:14.125
(Stillman)
'It was postmarked the day
Melanie disappeared.'

03:14.208 --> 03:16.250
'Cry for help.'

03:16.333 --> 03:18.375
Thirty one years too late
to save her.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.875
Well, maybe not too
late
to catch her killer.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.417
Melanie Campbell, age eight.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.667
Abducted from her bedroom.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.041
Night of October 23, 1975.

04:00.125 --> 04:02.166
Her bloody ballet shoe
found in a nearby park.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.125
Tender age search. Lot of
time,
manpower on this one.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.458
Body never recovered.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.792
Theory was an intruder
came in through

04:07.875 --> 04:09.333
a broken basement window.

04:09.417 --> 04:13.417
A postcard was sent
to her neighbor, Cherise
Pierce.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.375
- Never made it.
- These kids were tight.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.166
Best friends, hung out 24/7.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.750
Not the only Pierce in here.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.709
Prime suspect at the time
was Cherise's teenage brother

04:21.792 --> 04:23.500
'Terrell Pierce.'

04:23.583 --> 04:25.166
Based on what?

04:25.250 --> 04:28.667
Kid had no record,
straight-A student, Mr.
Clean.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.333
Neighbor ID'd Terrell
in the Campbells' backyard

04:30.417 --> 04:31.667
night of the abduction.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.208
In these words,
"Saw that colored boy

04:34.291 --> 04:36.333
monkeying around
on the side of their house."

04:36.417 --> 04:37.875
That's credible.

04:37.959 --> 04:40.250
Lifted a partial palm print from
the Campbells' basement window.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.750
No match to Terrell.

04:41.834 --> 04:45.291
Didn't stop them from
interrogating him...six
times.

04:45.375 --> 04:48.792
Her parents were questioned
too,
but dismissed as suspects.

04:48.875 --> 04:51.250
'Cause once the black kid
was ID'd it was all about
him.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.667
Brewerytown was
lilywhite back then.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.333
Pierces were the first
black family to move in.

04:55.417 --> 04:58.500
- That some kind of excuse?
- Not an excuse, the times.

04:58.583 --> 04:59.834
AKA white flight.

04:59.917 --> 05:01.417
Families hightailing it
to the burbs

05:01.500 --> 05:04.041
terrified that their
property values would tank.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.625
One way to spin it.

05:06.709 --> 05:09.583
At least one white family
stayed, the Campbells.

05:09.667 --> 05:12.041
Families of missin' kids
do that, refuse to move.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.500
Yeah, waiting for their
child
to walk through the door.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.125
Lilly's gonna talk
to the parents.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.291
You wanna take
Cherise and Terrell?

05:20.375 --> 05:21.625
Sure.

05:29.208 --> 05:32.875
Could be Terrell
didn't deserve any of this.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.083
Neither did Melanie.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.875
"The trolls got me."

05:50.500 --> 05:52.542
It was addressed
to the girl next
door

05:52.625 --> 05:54.875
Cherise Pierce.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.709
You think Melanie wrote that?

05:56.792 --> 05:58.000
Uh, possibly.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.500
Could the trolls
have meant something?

06:00.583 --> 06:01.667
Melanie was always going on

06:01.750 --> 06:04.792
about fairies
and trolls and fireflies.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.291
Quite an imagination.

06:06.375 --> 06:07.875
But it-it was just child's talk.

06:07.959 --> 06:09.333
Melanie did not write this.

06:09.417 --> 06:10.542
Well, how do you know?

06:10.625 --> 06:12.333
Well, she just started
the third grade

06:12.417 --> 06:14.625
and she didn't know cursive.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.083
Of course Melanie wrote that.
These are her words.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.417
But anyone who heard her
playing
would've known them.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.625
Who wrote it, then?

06:20.709 --> 06:22.125
Maybe the person who took her.

06:22.208 --> 06:25.709
What kind of a monster
would do a thing like that?

06:25.792 --> 06:28.083
That's what I'm here
to find out, Mrs. Campbell.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.625
- So you'll find Melanie,
too?
- Oh, Frances.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.208
She is alive.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.750
It's-it's been 31 years.

06:35.834 --> 06:39.458
I don't care if it's 131 years.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.625
Melanie is out there.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.291
Can I walk you out?

06:52.583 --> 06:54.041
Oh, well..

06:57.792 --> 06:59.750
We are prisoners in this house

06:59.834 --> 07:01.083
because my wife believes

07:01.166 --> 07:03.417
our daughter's gonna walk
through that front door.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.667
Just thought you should
know
we're reopening the case.

07:05.750 --> 07:09.500
All I want is to bury my child.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.458
I understand.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.709
Then bring her home.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.875
It was a lifetime ago.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.458
I barely remember that girl.

07:33.542 --> 07:36.375
And you were best friends
back when blacks and whites

07:36.458 --> 07:38.000
didn't exactly mix.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.917
Take a look around.
Still don't.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.875
I know you probably
got an unfair shake in '75.

07:43.959 --> 07:45.375
Probably?

07:45.458 --> 07:47.959
Cops had me in the box
for 16 hours at a time.

07:48.041 --> 07:49.125
That's rough.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.041
Should've seen
the '50s and '60s

07:51.125 --> 07:53.333
you wanna talk rough.

07:53.417 --> 07:56.458
You were ID'd in the girl's
yard
the night she disappeared.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.083
(Terrell)
By an old busybody
who thought

07:58.166 --> 08:00.625
blacks should
go back to Africa.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.709
(Miller)
So that was
a flat-out lie?

08:02.792 --> 08:04.208
Flat out.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.166
Talk about you and Melanie.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.792
Like I said,
it was a long time ago.

08:08.875 --> 08:13.083
The trolls
mean anyone in particular?

08:13.166 --> 08:16.625
Could be the difference between
finding Melanie's killer or not.

08:17.917 --> 08:20.375
Trolls were people
we didn't like.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.583
- Go on.
- 'We had codes for
everything.'

08:22.667 --> 08:26.709
I'd say something like,
Alvina lights a spark.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.041
"Alvina lights a spark?"

08:28.125 --> 08:30.709
Code for, I left a note
on our clothesline.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.667
So who were the trolls?

08:32.750 --> 08:34.083
Almost everyone.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.917
Our friendship wasn't
looked on too kindly.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
By who?

08:37.083 --> 08:39.750
The whole neighborhood
had it out for us.

08:39.834 --> 08:42.458
- 'From the start.'
- Everyone except Melanie.

08:42.542 --> 08:48.583
[crowd chanting]
Leave! Leave! Leave!

08:50.667 --> 08:53.166
Go back to where you came from!

09:02.291 --> 09:04.458
Get out of here, critters.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.792
What does critters
mean, Terrell?

09:16.125 --> 09:18.375
Dad told you
to go inside,
Cherise.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.458
Critters means bugs and stuff.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.166
Oh.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.125
Wanna see my fireflies?

09:28.208 --> 09:30.333
Are those bugs?

09:30.417 --> 09:32.041
Their booties light up at night.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.875
They do. Like magic.

09:35.959 --> 09:38.834
I mean, if you believe
in that stuff.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.625
Quit talking to that girl.

09:41.709 --> 09:43.083
Go home, Melanie.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.834
You're not the boss
of me, Mr. Wilson.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.250
I told you to go home. Now.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.250
Leave! Leave! Leave!

09:59.375 --> 10:01.709
My mom said you can
come over after
dinner.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.458
I live right here.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.125
We can catch fireflies
when it gets dark.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.166
- Okay.
- See you later, alligator.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.333
After a while, crocodile.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.375
(Jeffries)
'Quite a welcoming committee.'

10:16.458 --> 10:20.458
Courtesy of Hank Wilson.
Head of the civic club.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.500
Civic club?
More like a lynch
mob.

10:23.583 --> 10:26.667
Racists parading around
as neighborhood associations.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.542
Who was this bozo?

10:28.625 --> 10:30.500
He owned the local
hardware store.

10:30.583 --> 10:32.542
To him, the only
thing
worse than us

10:32.625 --> 10:34.458
were whites who didn't go along.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.041
Like Melanie.

10:39.041 --> 10:42.083
Our friendship might
have cost her her life.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.250
It was our
neighborhood,
not theirs.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.834
Your family was there
for 30 years

11:00.917 --> 11:02.166
then, here come the coloreds.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.750
And to make matters worse

11:03.834 --> 11:05.959
little Melanie Campbell gets all
buddy-buddy with the black girl.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.458
Could make a die hard racist
like you blow a gasket.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.000
Whoa, hold on there.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.250
When Melanie disappeared

11:11.333 --> 11:14.583
all the white people
got spooked, moved out.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.417
Had to sell my house at a loss.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.583
Boohoo.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.959
We were working people.
House was all we had.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.542
Beat up your own kid regular
for looking at you funny.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.083
What's that got to do
with anything?

11:24.166 --> 11:25.583
Maybe you let the fists fly
with Melanie.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.417
Lippy little kid
must have pissed you off.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.250
I was workin' at the hardware
store the night she
disappeared.

11:30.333 --> 11:31.875
- We'll check that.
- Go ahead.

11:31.959 --> 11:35.166
While you're at it, check out
a
guy by the name of Wes Floyd.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.458
- Who's he?
- Real estate scumbag

11:37.542 --> 11:40.000
That was creepin' around
the neighborhood back then.

11:40.083 --> 11:43.000
Tried to scare all
the white folks into moving.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.625
Why? So he could clean up?

11:44.709 --> 11:46.959
Type like that would do
anything for a buck.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.750
(male #1)
'You hear about that
break-in'

11:49.834 --> 11:51.500
'the other day?
Right down the street.'

11:51.583 --> 11:53.583
(Frances)
'Thank goodness
no one was hurt.'

11:53.667 --> 11:56.375
Imagine what would happen
if that family was home?

11:56.458 --> 11:59.000
- That's terrifying.
- Known fact.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.291
Blacks move in, crime goes up.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.500
(both)
...six, seven, eight,
nine, ten..

12:04.583 --> 12:07.458
Bad things happen
to decent people.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.000
Well, we all know
one another here.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.959
Oh, for now, sure,
but once the dam breaks

12:11.041 --> 12:12.959
no stoppin' who comes in.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.959
You don't wanna be
the last to leave, do
you?

12:15.041 --> 12:16.500
I guess not, but--

12:16.583 --> 12:18.959
Place like Genessee Creek
offers a safe environment

12:19.041 --> 12:20.917
for families like yours.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.959
State of the art kitchens.
A big yard.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.125
A pool.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.834
This heat, a pool would be nice.

12:26.917 --> 12:27.792
Huh?

12:27.875 --> 12:30.709
Don't you fall for it, Frances.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.875
Get out of here.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.500
I know what you're doin'.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.125
Just doin' business.

12:37.208 --> 12:39.041
Showin' the nice lady
the homes I have for sale.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.333
You're trying to scare
whites
out of this neighborhood.

12:42.417 --> 12:44.083
But nobody here's leavin'.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.500
Except the spooks over there.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.667
'It's our neighborhood.'

12:49.917 --> 12:51.792
Sure it is.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.625
My husband would never agree.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.458
Neighborhood's gonna
tip one day soon

13:06.542 --> 13:08.667
and you'll be the last
white face around.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.417
Not if I can help it.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.041
And if one bad thing happens
to some nice little white
kid?

13:17.792 --> 13:20.125
Won't be up to you.

13:25.333 --> 13:29.000
His houses in the suburbs
weren't sellin' worth squat.

13:29.083 --> 13:32.542
Then Melanie disappears
and he makes a killin'.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.625
Neighborhood tipped
in,
like, eight seconds.

13:35.709 --> 13:37.041
Thanks for sharin'.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.583
Now get before I
dropkick you out of here.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.834
Genessee Creek.

13:46.917 --> 13:50.000
It's that Tony
Subdivision
over near Abington.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.458
Lot of people made a killing
off of white flight.

13:52.542 --> 13:55.834
Sounds like this Wes Floyd
guy
was one of 'em.

14:07.834 --> 14:11.125
I see your real estate ads
all over the place, Wes.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.250
Bus stops, billboards.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.542
I do well.

14:14.625 --> 14:17.333
And to think it all started
with Genessee Creek

14:17.417 --> 14:19.834
and the abduction
and murder of a little girl.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.166
I'm a businessman,
not a killer.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.875
You made out like a bandit
after
Melanie Campbell disappeared.

14:26.959 --> 14:29.250
(Jeffries)
'Sold 12 homes in one week.'

14:29.333 --> 14:31.333
They say you make your own luck.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.917
Maybe you made yours.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.041
The timing was
fortuitous,
so arrest me.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.625
Already have a record, Wes?

14:39.709 --> 14:41.125
Silly trespassing charges

14:41.208 --> 14:43.458
for putting a few sold
signs
in people's yards.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.959
To make it look like people
were
moving when they weren't.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.583
Smashed a few windows, too.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.125
Made people think
crime was going
up.

14:50.208 --> 14:53.417
Scare them out of Brewerytown
into your white suburb.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.208
It was business.

14:55.291 --> 14:58.041
And it was the neighbors that
had it out for Melanie, not
me.

14:58.125 --> 15:01.000
- Neighbors like who?
- The kids on that block.

15:01.083 --> 15:04.250
Saw the troubles
myself
at the bus stop.

15:08.709 --> 15:10.667
Fairies like sweet stuff.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.375
Like honey?

15:12.458 --> 15:15.000
What if we put
some in a jar?

15:15.083 --> 15:16.333
Yeah, and
if
they like
it..

15:16.417 --> 15:17.792
First day of school
and Melanie's already

15:17.875 --> 15:19.083
got a show-and-tell.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.500
You gonna talk jive for us, huh?

15:23.583 --> 15:25.834
- Dy-no-mite.
- Shut up, Dale.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.208
Come on, Mel, we don't
got to listen to him.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.333
What'd you say, darkie?

15:30.417 --> 15:32.917
Um...nothing.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Then say you're sorry.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.000
Or I'm gonna smack you.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.041
<i>you?</i>

15:42.000 --> 15:43.500
Second thought..

15:43.583 --> 15:45.959
...maybe Melanie should get
in the first lick.

15:46.041 --> 15:47.458
- Hit her.
- No.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.041
- Hit her.
- Stop it.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.750
- Hit her.
- I said stop.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.166
Little bitch.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.083
Come on.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.709
Stupid troll.

16:09.959 --> 16:13.083
Saw that kid picking on
the little ones all the
time.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.375
You know his name?

16:14.458 --> 16:16.625
Dale Wilson.
Hank Wilson's son.

16:16.709 --> 16:20.041
- Runt-of-the-litter type.
- Humiliated by a little
girl.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.709
In front
of the other kids.

16:21.792 --> 16:23.875
And if Dale
was anything like his pops

16:23.959 --> 16:26.709
not exactly the forgiving
and forgetting type.

16:33.417 --> 16:34.959
(Stillman)
'How'd it make
you feel, Dale?'

16:35.041 --> 16:36.709
(Valens)
Getting popped by
Melanie Campbell

16:36.792 --> 16:38.208
in front
of everybody.

16:38.291 --> 16:39.792
(Stillman)
'Not long after,
she goes missing.'

16:39.875 --> 16:42.083
I was just young, dumb.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.667
Can't argue there.

16:43.750 --> 16:44.875
Held back twice.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.250
So? That don't mean nothing.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.709
Your old man was damn near

16:47.792 --> 16:49.917
burning crosses
on lawns back
then.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.458
You telling me
you didn't get
even?

16:51.542 --> 16:52.792
I'm not my father.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.166
You sure acted like him
at that bus stop.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.875
And I felt bad about it.

16:58.959 --> 17:00.875
No one knew better than me

17:00.959 --> 17:03.583
what it's like getting picked
on
by someone twice your size.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.583
Oh, so you just
let it pass, then?

17:05.667 --> 17:07.750
Let bygones be bygones.

17:09.667 --> 17:12.291
I went to Melanie's house
the next day.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.083
To even the score?

17:17.166 --> 17:19.500
To apologize.

17:27.083 --> 17:30.500
We can leave notes
to each other here from now
on.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.667
Where no one'll see 'em.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.625
- 'In the storm pipe?'
- Yeah.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.125
(Dale)
'What are you doing?'

17:35.208 --> 17:37.125
Get away from us, Dale.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.041
I'm sorry
for what I did, okay?

17:39.125 --> 17:41.208
Sorry to both of us?

17:41.834 --> 17:43.291
Yeah.

17:43.375 --> 17:45.250
Now get down from there
before you hurt yourself.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.000
Why are you crying?

17:51.083 --> 17:52.792
My mom took down
the clothesline.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.709
She said we can't play
together anymore.

17:54.792 --> 17:58.625
Her mom said they're
going to move, too.

17:58.709 --> 17:59.792
Why?

17:59.875 --> 18:01.542
'Cause the neighbors
don't like fireflies

18:01.625 --> 18:03.208
and bugs and stuff.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.500
- Who doesn't?
- Them.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.417
That isn't about your fireflies.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.959
It isn't?

18:15.417 --> 18:18.208
It's about Cherise.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.333
She's the critter, stupid.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.500
- I'm a bug?
- No, not a bug.

18:22.583 --> 18:23.875
A critter's like--

18:23.959 --> 18:25.542
Like what?

18:25.625 --> 18:28.083
Like not us.

18:28.166 --> 18:30.458
A critter's
like...not a person.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.834
- But I'm a person.
- Yeah.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.166
Look, you don't see
horses and chickens

18:35.250 --> 18:36.333
playing together, do you?

18:36.417 --> 18:37.667
and

18:37.750 --> 18:40.583
But they don't play together,
do they?

18:48.375 --> 18:50.500
That's a hell of a
thing
to tell a kid.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.667
That's the way the world was.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.542
I was just the messenger.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.709
Someone vandalized
their house?

18:59.792 --> 19:02.208
That's, uh,
the story, anyway.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.583
What, you disputing it, Dale?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.041
All I know..

19:06.125 --> 19:08.542
...Mrs. Campbell came
into my dad's hardware store

19:08.625 --> 19:10.041
asking about paint removers.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.542
To get rid of the graffiti.
So what?

19:12.625 --> 19:15.709
<i>before</i>
her house got vandalized.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.542
Are you saying Mrs.
Campbell
knew it was gonna happen?

19:19.625 --> 19:24.083
I'm saying...she wrote
those words herself.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.750
Melanie and Cherise
were best friends.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.792
- That's right.
- It concern you at all?

19:36.875 --> 19:39.500
Your daughter hanging
with a black girl?

19:39.583 --> 19:42.000
No.
Why are you asking?

19:42.083 --> 19:44.250
"Critter lovers."
Remember that?

19:44.333 --> 19:46.917
Someone spray painted
those words on our house.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.375
Never reported it.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.750
Wonder why.

19:54.834 --> 19:58.208
It was nothing, it was just
a couple of pranksters.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.875
'Why stir up more trouble?'

19:59.959 --> 20:02.500
We know about the visit to the
hardware store, Mrs. Campbell.

20:02.583 --> 20:05.583
- What are you talking about?
- Things were heating up.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.500
You wanted to get out
of the neighborhood.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.000
Get to Genessee Creek.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.291
That's why you vandalized
your own home.

20:17.709 --> 20:19.875
People were so angry.

20:19.959 --> 20:23.250
Hank, all the
rest.
I was afraid.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.625
- Of what they'd do to you.
- Not me. Melanie.

20:25.709 --> 20:29.125
There was
so much hatred.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.291
Ugliness.

20:30.375 --> 20:32.583
You wanted to shield
her
from all that.

20:34.709 --> 20:40.208
So I...told her not
to play with Cherise anymore.

20:42.417 --> 20:45.000
That sometimes it's best
to stick with your own.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.125
Aw, for God's sake, Frances.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.500
You refused to leave.
I didn't have a choice.

20:49.583 --> 20:54.083
They were decent, hard-working
people just like us.

20:54.166 --> 20:55.583
I know.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.834
I was just trying
to protect my little girl.

20:59.917 --> 21:03.625
I had no idea
what damage it would cause.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.333
Dale?

21:09.417 --> 21:11.125
Dale?

21:11.208 --> 21:14.000
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

21:14.083 --> 21:16.917
Who hit you?
T-tell me.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.834
My dad.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.834
Heard about
that
critter lover.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.375
Said it was my fault all
the white people are moving
out.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.875
Crazy, huh, Mrs. C?

21:30.917 --> 21:33.667
Be sure and get an ice pack
from the school nurse.

21:38.125 --> 21:40.166
Alvina lights a spark.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.375
Mel, you hear me?

21:43.458 --> 21:45.166
Alvina lights a spark.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.000
I'm not
playing
that anymore.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.458
It's little kids' stuff.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.583
You don't wanna see
the fireflies?

21:55.625 --> 21:57.166
No.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.542
They're gonna leave,
turn to fairies.

21:59.625 --> 22:02.208
Fireflies
aren't
fairies,
okay.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.583
But you said--

22:03.667 --> 22:05.500
And horses and chickens
don't play together.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.917
You said
we'd be friends forever.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.291
No such thing as forever.

22:23.458 --> 22:26.333
That night
my little girl was gone.

22:31.792 --> 22:34.375
I thought our child
was in danger.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.750
And she was.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.792
"Alvina lights a spark."

22:42.875 --> 22:44.583
That meant Cherise
left a note for Melanie.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.500
But the clothesline was down.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.709
So they were leaving them
in the storm pipe, right?

22:52.500 --> 22:55.000
The note never turned up.

22:57.917 --> 23:02.500
Uh...that's a reach.
Need some leverage.

23:02.583 --> 23:06.667
Same basement window
the doer used in '75.

23:06.750 --> 23:11.542
Lifted a partial palm
print
off of that ledge.

23:11.625 --> 23:14.875
It wasn't a hand print
on the ledge.

23:14.959 --> 23:17.291
It was a foot.

23:28.250 --> 23:31.291
Neighbor spotted you
in the Campbells'
yard

23:31.375 --> 23:32.625
night Melanie disappeared.

23:32.709 --> 23:34.125
Already told you..

23:34.208 --> 23:36.542
...racist old bat made that up.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.667
Got a print
off that window
ledge.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.667
From a heel.

23:48.792 --> 23:51.542
Tell me it's not gonna
match yours, Terrell.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.041
I didn't hurt that white girl.

23:56.125 --> 23:57.917
I said..

23:58.000 --> 24:00.208
...tell me it's not
gonna match yours.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.583
You made me a fool.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.875
I defended you to my
boss,
believed in you.

24:10.959 --> 24:13.125
Maybe you shouldn't have.

24:22.917 --> 24:24.291
What were
you doing in her
yard?

24:24.375 --> 24:25.667
Getting the note back
for my sister.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.041
Then why not say that?

24:27.125 --> 24:28.583
A black boy
in a white girl's yard

24:28.667 --> 24:29.875
same night she goes missing?

24:29.959 --> 24:31.083
'No one's gonna believe me.'

24:31.166 --> 24:33.875
- I would.
- You're the police.

24:33.959 --> 24:36.750
I learned 31 years ago
what that means.

24:36.834 --> 24:39.417
Guilty till proven innocent.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.792
They treated me
like I wasn't even human.

24:42.917 --> 24:44.875
Times change, Terrell.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.709
Not so much.

24:46.792 --> 24:50.959
I just wanted
to protect my little
sister.

24:51.041 --> 24:53.458
I did what I had
to do that night.

24:53.542 --> 24:54.959
Go on.

24:55.875 --> 24:58.000
I told Cherise the truth.

25:08.917 --> 25:12.041
Heard about what went down
at the bus stop today.

25:12.125 --> 25:13.250
Sorry.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.709
I left a note for her
in the storm pipe.

25:15.792 --> 25:18.625
- For Melanie?
- Maybe she'll find it.

25:18.709 --> 25:20.083
And want to be friends again?

25:20.166 --> 25:21.417
Cherise..

25:24.417 --> 25:26.166
...she's never gonna
be your friend.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.917
You see, white people

25:28.000 --> 25:31.166
they look at us,
and they see
ugliness.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.625
They do?

25:32.709 --> 25:34.583
They don't see
how pretty you
are

25:34.667 --> 25:38.166
or how smart or how cool.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.875
But I do.

25:39.959 --> 25:42.750
And you gotta see that, too.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.125
Melanie thinks I'm cool.

25:45.208 --> 25:48.667
You can't trust 'em.
Not even Melanie.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.125
I can't?

25:50.208 --> 25:52.333
Emmett Till learned that
the hard way.

25:52.417 --> 25:53.500
Who's Emmett Till?

25:53.583 --> 25:56.166
Boy who whistled
at a white girl.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.041
After, these dudes
dragged him out of
bed

25:59.125 --> 26:02.625
in the middle of
the night, shot
him.

26:02.709 --> 26:04.625
He wasn't even
that much older than
you.

26:04.709 --> 26:08.291
Now I'm not trying to give you
nightmares or anything,
Cherise.

26:08.375 --> 26:10.625
I'm just lookin' out
for my little sis.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.875
Will you get
the note back for me?

26:18.667 --> 26:20.000
Please?

26:21.875 --> 26:23.750
Sure thing.

26:26.792 --> 26:29.750
Now, go to bed, okay?

26:34.041 --> 26:35.333
Terrell?

26:36.041 --> 26:37.208
Yeah?

26:37.291 --> 26:39.375
Did Emmett go to heaven?

26:41.583 --> 26:43.709
All kids go to heaven.

26:53.917 --> 26:55.834
I never forgot
the look in her eyes

26:55.917 --> 26:57.375
when I told her that.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.834
She grew up faster
than she should have.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.041
Sounds like you both did.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.750
So..

27:10.125 --> 27:12.375
...you got the note?

27:14.375 --> 27:15.667
It was gone
when I got there.

27:15.750 --> 27:19.542
Gone?
Who took
it?

27:19.625 --> 27:21.959
I guess Melanie.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.625
- You tell Cherise that?
- Yeah.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.834
Do you know what the note said?

27:28.875 --> 27:30.709
You gotta make
this right,
Terrell.

27:30.792 --> 27:32.208
By me.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.250
Cherise just wanted
her friend back.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.417
What'd the note say?

27:38.875 --> 27:42.834
"Meet me in the woods..

27:42.917 --> 27:44.500
...tonight."

27:49.875 --> 27:51.667
So Melanie went into
the woods that night.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.834
And so did Cherise.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.500
(Vera)
'Melanie wasn't abducted
from her bedroom.'

28:04.583 --> 28:06.291
She went to
the woods that night.

28:06.375 --> 28:07.875
The woods?

28:07.959 --> 28:09.875
You asked her to meet you
there,
Cherise, in your note.

28:09.959 --> 28:12.083
That's ridiculous.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.667
"Alvina lights a spark."

28:13.750 --> 28:16.750
Your secret code.
Meant you left her a
note.

28:16.834 --> 28:18.625
"Meet me
in the woods tonight."

28:18.709 --> 28:20.709
'You were waiting
for her there.'

28:20.792 --> 28:24.709
We were best friends.
For forever and a day.

28:24.792 --> 28:27.250
But Melanie didn't
believe
in forever anymore.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.917
The bus stop.
She abandoned you.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.792
- Quite a betrayal.
- It was.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.208
What happened
in the woods that
night?

28:33.291 --> 28:35.166
I spent my whole life
trying to forget.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.083
But you couldn't.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.291
We moved to
an all black neighborhood

28:41.375 --> 28:43.458
a world away from Brewerytown.

28:43.542 --> 28:46.750
And it just got easier to
pretend like it never
happened.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.625
What never happened?

28:50.125 --> 28:51.875
I should have listened
to Terrell.

28:51.959 --> 28:53.458
Black and white,
never meant to be.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.834
And I have spent my entire
life
living like that.

28:55.917 --> 28:59.417
Never trusting
another white
person.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.291
We believed fireflies
were fairies

29:02.375 --> 29:04.500
and friendships lasted forever.

29:07.709 --> 29:09.834
But we were wrong.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.917
Look, fairies.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.375
Last of the season.

29:25.458 --> 29:27.125
Thought you didn't believe
in fairies.

29:27.208 --> 29:29.041
I'm sorry I was mean
to you at the bus
stop.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.500
Why'd you do that?

29:30.583 --> 29:32.917
My mom said it was
better
to stick with your own.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.500
Terrell said that, too.

29:34.583 --> 29:36.333
But I don't want
to stick with my own.

29:36.417 --> 29:38.166
I want to be with you, Cherise.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.542
Me, too, Mel.

29:39.625 --> 29:41.333
You're my best friend.

29:41.417 --> 29:42.542
Forever?

29:42.625 --> 29:44.083
And a day.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.875
Can't keep away
from that critter, can you?

29:54.959 --> 29:56.291
What do you want, Dale?

29:56.375 --> 29:58.083
I drive to this critter's
house
to scare her

29:58.166 --> 30:00.542
and what do I see?

30:00.625 --> 30:02.667
This one trying
to sneak off.

30:02.750 --> 30:04.834
Thought you could get away, huh?

30:06.750 --> 30:09.750
I got beat because my dad thinks
that I spray painted your house.

30:09.834 --> 30:11.875
- Did you?
- No.

30:11.959 --> 30:13.291
And now the whole neighborhood's
gonna move out

30:13.375 --> 30:15.709
and he says it's 'cause of me.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.583
He hates me.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.291
You're scaring us.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.834
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't moved here.

30:25.917 --> 30:28.000
I wanna go home.

30:29.125 --> 30:30.542
Melanie, run!

30:38.667 --> 30:41.625
I heard the gunshots,
and I knew

30:41.709 --> 30:43.083
and I did nothing.

30:43.166 --> 30:45.083
Just kept running.

30:45.166 --> 30:47.250
Anyone would have.

30:47.333 --> 30:50.000
It's my fault
we were in the woods.

30:53.041 --> 30:55.792
It's my fault she died.

30:55.875 --> 30:58.250
You weren't
the one with the gun.

30:58.333 --> 31:01.500
Every night
I would dream about him

31:01.583 --> 31:03.792
coming into my room
and taking me.

31:05.625 --> 31:10.250
And then
the dreams finally stopped.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.625
Until now.

31:11.709 --> 31:13.709
The postcard.

31:15.166 --> 31:18.333
Just the other night
I had a dream.

31:18.417 --> 31:21.625
Melanie was with the fireflies.

31:21.709 --> 31:24.000
In a better place.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.333
Heaven.

31:30.041 --> 31:31.291
Oh.

31:37.166 --> 31:40.375
(Stillman)
We got an eyewitness
who saw you shoot Melanie.

31:40.458 --> 31:41.750
That's crazy.

31:41.834 --> 31:42.875
Is it?

31:42.959 --> 31:45.208
Cherise didn't
see me shoot nobody.

31:50.041 --> 31:53.667
Never said it
was Cherise,
Dale.

31:53.750 --> 31:54.959
You sent the postcard

31:55.041 --> 31:56.750
insurance,
to keep Cherise
quiet.

31:56.834 --> 31:58.125
Your old man beat
the crap outta you.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.625
'You were lookin'
to get even.'

31:59.709 --> 32:01.375
You followed Cherise
into the woods that
night

32:01.458 --> 32:03.959
with your father's gun.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.000
I never meant to hurt--

32:09.083 --> 32:10.333
Oh, cut the bull.

32:10.417 --> 32:13.333
- You shot at Cherise.
- To scare her.

32:18.083 --> 32:22.583
But then...she screamed..

32:22.667 --> 32:24.667
...and I thought..

32:24.750 --> 32:28.041
...I thought I killed her.
And I panicked.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.500
So you had to kill Melanie,
too.
She was a witness.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.709
Point of no return.

32:32.792 --> 32:37.709
My dad beat me every night
for that critter-lover thing.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.875
If he found out about this..

32:42.959 --> 32:44.500
...he'd kill me.

32:44.583 --> 32:48.458
So I did what I had to do.

32:48.542 --> 32:50.000
What, Dale?

32:51.959 --> 32:56.041
I put her in the car and drove.

32:56.125 --> 32:57.583
For hours.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.750
Till we got to
the West Virginia state
line.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.083
Then what happened?

33:02.166 --> 33:04.333
Then I pulled off the road.

33:06.125 --> 33:09.834
It was dark
and there was no one around.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.667
Just us.

33:27.583 --> 33:30.250
Stop.

33:30.333 --> 33:31.792
Right here.

33:33.333 --> 33:36.250
Why'd you have to be
friends
with that critter?

33:42.583 --> 33:44.250
Why?

33:44.333 --> 33:46.625
I just want to go home.

33:49.792 --> 33:51.542
This is all your fault,
you hear me.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.625
'Cause you had
to be friends with her.

33:54.709 --> 33:55.959
Please.

33:57.834 --> 33:59.750
Close your eyes.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.959
I want my mommy.

34:08.917 --> 34:11.583
You can't tell on me.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.792
Please.

34:13.875 --> 34:15.583
Not anymore.

34:21.583 --> 34:25.500
And then I just..

34:25.583 --> 34:27.375
...drove away.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.125
No unidentified
child murder victims

34:44.208 --> 34:47.542
that age in West Virginia,
in 1975.

34:47.625 --> 34:49.500
(Rush)
Doesn't make sense.

34:49.583 --> 34:52.333
(Vera)
Rural area. Animals could've
carried her off.

34:52.417 --> 34:53.750
Or the body
was never
found.

34:53.834 --> 34:55.834
Interstate files are a joke.

34:55.917 --> 34:58.500
No national database
on missing kids back then.

34:58.583 --> 35:01.834
Kid crossed state lines,
easy to fall through the
cracks.

35:01.917 --> 35:04.500
So even if the body was found

35:04.583 --> 35:06.667
no way to connect it
to our missing Philly girl.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.834
Yeah, needle in a haystack.

35:08.917 --> 35:11.333
Police report, West Virginia,
October '75.

35:11.417 --> 35:14.125
State trooper found
a girl just off Route 1.

35:14.208 --> 35:17.166
She was shot but
alive.
Head injury.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.500
No memory of who she was
or where she came from.

35:19.583 --> 35:23.166
Transported to the County
Hospital in critical
condition.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.959
Then put in foster care.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.000
Melanie's still alive?

35:32.792 --> 35:34.458
(Rush)
'Excuse me?'

35:36.333 --> 35:37.959
(Rush)
'Are you Jennifer Robinson?'

35:38.041 --> 35:41.792
- Yeah.
- Philadelphia PD.

35:41.875 --> 35:43.083
Okay.

35:43.166 --> 35:46.375
You were
a gunshot victim in '75.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.792
Ain't you folks
a little late to the
party?

35:48.875 --> 35:50.333
You don't remember
the shooting?

35:50.417 --> 35:52.792
Or where you're from?

35:52.875 --> 35:54.875
Couldn't have been good, right?

35:54.959 --> 35:57.917
Family was probably the
reason
I was in those woods.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.709
You're wrong.

35:59.792 --> 36:02.375
Your mom and dad never
stopped looking for you.

36:02.458 --> 36:07.208
Never stopped hoping you'd...
walk through their door again.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.417
Is that right?

36:08.500 --> 36:11.291
Their names are Norman
and Frances Campbell.

36:11.375 --> 36:14.125
Good people.

36:14.208 --> 36:16.834
I don't remember. Sorry.

36:18.875 --> 36:21.083
They never forgot you, Melanie.

36:24.959 --> 36:26.250
Is that my name?

36:26.333 --> 36:28.417
And your best friend
was a girl named Cherise.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.834
She was with you that night,
in the woods.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.250
A lot of people still waitin'..

36:36.333 --> 36:38.417
...for you to come home.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.500
I should get back to work.

36:41.583 --> 36:43.875
You and Cherise
left notes for each other

36:43.959 --> 36:47.250
on the...on the clothesline.

36:47.333 --> 36:51.333
You believed
in fireflies and fairies.

36:51.417 --> 36:53.500
Please. Stop.

36:53.583 --> 36:55.750
That's why he brought you
into the woods

36:55.834 --> 36:58.667
'because you were brave.'

36:58.750 --> 37:00.834
In a world that wasn't.

37:05.458 --> 37:07.125
I remember..

37:09.667 --> 37:12.375
...I wasn't alone.

37:12.458 --> 37:14.417
In the woods.

37:14.500 --> 37:18.291
Because the fireflies
were there..

37:18.375 --> 37:21.834
...telling me heaven
had to wait.

37:21.917 --> 37:24.083
'Cause I had to live.
