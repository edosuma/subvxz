00:03.069 --> 00:05.537
<i>CIA profile:
Agent Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.538 --> 00:06.438
Okay. I'm in.

00:06.439 --> 00:09.499
<i>Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow.</i>

00:09.576 --> 00:11.510
<i>Also a double agent with CIA.</i>

00:11.511 --> 00:12.811
Get down!

00:12.812 --> 00:15.080
I guess we'll have to learn
to trust each other.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.349
<i>Bristow's CIA contact:
Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.418
My guardian angel.

00:19.419 --> 00:24.015
<i>Her current assignment:
To infiltrate and destroy SD-6.</i>

00:24.090 --> 00:26.558
<i>A secret organization
dealing in espionage,</i>

00:26.559 --> 00:29.790
<i>extortion, weapons sales,
posing as the CIA.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:32.855
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.867
<i>SD-6 director: Arvin Sloane.</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:37.462
The sanctity of this agency
requires the sacrifice

00:37.537 --> 00:39.071
of some personal freedoms.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.572
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

00:41.608 --> 00:44.270
This is about killing
the monster.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.133
You're Alexander Khasinau.

01:15.141 --> 01:18.338
- You should eat something.
- I'm not hungry.

01:28.788 --> 01:31.288
Wait.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.185
I have questions for you.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.962
You can ask my boss.

01:36.963 --> 01:39.463
Your boss?

01:39.999 --> 01:43.059
I thought "The Man"
was the boss.

01:43.636 --> 01:46.136
Yes.

01:46.372 --> 01:49.034
Yes, but I am not "The Man. "

02:10.864 --> 02:14.163
I've waited almost 30 years
for this.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.038
Mom?

02:30.750 --> 02:34.811
You must have known
this day would come.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.793
I could have prevented
all this, of course.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.556
You were so small
when you were born.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.662
It would have been so easy.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.234
Tell me.

02:51.070 --> 02:54.767
Sydney, who sent you here?

02:56.910 --> 02:59.606
You must tell me.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.179
Or what?

03:03.583 --> 03:04.917
I'm grounded?

03:13.059 --> 03:15.494
Tell you what.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.995
Think about it.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.933
I'll come back
and ask you again.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.869
You were shot by your mother?

03:35.081 --> 03:36.582
Yes.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.450
And you don't have a problem?

03:38.451 --> 03:41.045
Yes, of course I have problems.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.112
The problems I have,
I can handle.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.858
How did you escape?

03:46.859 --> 03:49.359
I'm sorry.
But Agent Vaughn is missing.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.523
And my telling Houdini stories
to a CIA shrink...

03:52.599 --> 03:54.766
no offense... is pointless.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.969
No one should be worrying
about me.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.870
We should all be looking
for him.

03:58.871 --> 04:02.466
You're frustrated because you're
not part of the search team.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.376
But, Sydney, they're looking.

04:04.377 --> 04:07.608
And you've been ordered
to come and talk to me.

04:12.485 --> 04:16.079
I couldn't get out of the room
until I got out of the chair.

04:16.154 --> 04:19.022
It was an unreinforced
aluminum chair.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.975
I wedged it
against a water valve.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.476
Put stress on the weld points.

04:57.597 --> 05:01.294
Getting past the door was
a little more complicated.

05:33.132 --> 05:37.398
And you did all this
with a bullet in your shoulder?

05:37.470 --> 05:39.037
Do you not believe me?

05:39.038 --> 05:40.505
It's impressive.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.606
Not really.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.508
One thing I've learned
doing this.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.009
There's no drug like adrenaline.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.204
Where the hell are you?

06:12.205 --> 06:15.504
I'm in the middle of Taipei.
Is Vaughn with you?

06:15.575 --> 06:18.635
No. We haven't heard from him.
Sydney, get to the plane.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.746
- I have to go back.
- There's no time.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.081
The authorities will check
this airstrip.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.716
I can't leave him behind.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.885
- Hold the plane.
- Sydney, wait!

06:32.058 --> 06:33.225
Who's Vaughn?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.726
Tell me about Vaughn.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.595
He's my CIA handler.

06:42.368 --> 06:45.769
For a long time, he was
the only person I could trust.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.564
I think that still might be
the case.

06:50.176 --> 06:52.906
Anyway, a good friend of mine,

06:52.979 --> 06:56.972
a civilian, Will Tippin,
was kidnapped.

06:57.049 --> 07:00.746
Vaughn came to me.
He offered to help.

07:00.820 --> 07:04.381
So the two of us and my father
went to Taipei to get my friend.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.957
How did Vaughn go missing?

07:07.894 --> 07:09.428
The last time I saw Vaughn

07:09.429 --> 07:11.929
was the night before
my mother shot me.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.034
While my father was paying
a ransom

07:16.035 --> 07:19.232
in exchange for my friend,
Vaughn and I went in to destroy

07:19.305 --> 07:21.865
one of the kidnappers'
research facilities.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.240
We broke in through a club
in the building next door.

07:25.311 --> 07:28.337
Along the way, we split up.

07:28.414 --> 07:32.077
When I got to the lab
I was supposed to destroy...

07:33.386 --> 07:37.049
I found something...

07:37.123 --> 07:39.623
unusual.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.360
What was it?

07:42.361 --> 07:44.861
The short answer is
I have no idea.

07:44.864 --> 07:47.364
But there was no time,
and I did my job.

07:52.205 --> 07:56.039
By destroying Khasinau's lab,
I flooded the building.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.686
Hmm.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.986
When you woke up, you were
handcuffed to an aluminum chair.

08:45.057 --> 08:49.426
After I escaped, I went back
to the last place I'd seen him.

08:49.495 --> 08:53.431
There was a hazmat team cleaning
up the mess, testing the water.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.901
I stole a suit and went in.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.192
I found Vaughn's coat.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.996
When I finally made it
back to the plane,

09:27.066 --> 09:29.566
Vaughn still hadn't shown up.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.010
Okay. Easy.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.449
What happened to the guy
who shot you?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.620
There was no guy.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.891
It was Mom.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.227
And it didn't seem like
she worked for Khasinau.

10:00.299 --> 10:02.767
It seems that Khasinau
works for her.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.636
Did you say you were shot
by your mother?

10:04.637 --> 10:05.470
Sit down.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.576
Hello?

10:11.577 --> 10:13.745
Hey. Where are you?

10:13.746 --> 10:15.914
Just coming home
from San Francisco.

10:15.915 --> 10:19.248
- Have you heard from Will?
- Have I heard from Will? No.

10:19.318 --> 10:20.085
Me neither.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.387
There's this story on the news.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.888
Will wrote a story that wasn't
supposed to get printed

10:24.957 --> 10:27.721
- unless he went missing.
- What was Will's story about?

10:27.793 --> 10:30.853
It's about the murder of
your fiancÃ© and some conspiracy

10:30.930 --> 10:32.897
and some group called SD-6.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.100
What did you write about SD-6?

10:35.101 --> 10:38.696
Nothing! Just the name!
I don't even know what it is!

10:38.771 --> 10:40.839
Why?
Do you know what it is?

10:40.840 --> 10:44.571
Are they good? Are they bad?
Do you work with them?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.978
Will was asking
all the questions I would ask.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.709
What did you say to him?

10:49.782 --> 10:52.444
Without going into details,
we told the truth.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.819
That my father and I work
for the CIA.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.288
That we're working undercover
at SD-6,

10:57.289 --> 11:00.747
one of a number of agencies
based in various countries

11:00.826 --> 11:04.284
that trade in weapons, drugs,
and intelligence that use

11:04.363 --> 11:06.888
covert means to undermine
governments and industry

11:06.966 --> 11:09.334
in their attempts
to take over the world.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.835
So, what was his reaction?

11:12.905 --> 11:14.539
Seriously?

11:14.540 --> 11:17.270
He thought
it sounded preposterous.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.010
Which is appropriate.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.242
Did Will's article put you
in danger at SD-6?

11:22.314 --> 11:26.080
My problems at SD-6 came
from a different source.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.610
As you're aware,
I was shot last year

11:29.689 --> 11:32.715
while on a mission
with Agent Bristow.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.488
I was left with few memories
of that day.

11:35.561 --> 11:38.792
The doctors said that type
of memory loss was typical.

11:38.864 --> 11:43.767
But then, last week,
I remembered something.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.703
I remembered Agent Bristow
trying to save my life

11:46.772 --> 11:48.740
using a SatCom radio.

11:48.741 --> 11:52.541
What was unusual
was that she I.D.'d herself

11:52.611 --> 11:55.603
with a call sign
not issued by SD-6.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.549
Call sign "Freelancer. "

11:57.550 --> 12:00.110
Last Thursday night,
I followed Agent Bristow.

12:00.186 --> 12:03.053
I watched as she illegally
gained access

12:03.122 --> 12:05.989
to an SD-6 facility
in Santa Barbara.

12:06.058 --> 12:10.290
I prayed, sir,
that there was an explanation.

12:10.362 --> 12:14.958
But when I confronted Sydney,
she had none.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.796
As a servant of this country,

12:18.871 --> 12:23.535
despite the fact
it breaks my heart to do so...

12:23.609 --> 12:26.134
I must report
that I believe Sydney Bristow

12:26.212 --> 12:28.806
to be a double agent.

12:28.881 --> 12:32.339
My father, of course,
anticipated this.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.353
You and I need to assume
Dixon's reported you.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.549
The best move is for me to take
full responsibility.

12:38.624 --> 12:41.124
What about Will?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.261
You're gonna have a hard time.

12:45.998 --> 12:49.434
Then we landed
and went back to SD-6.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.266
As my father predicted,
they took me into custody.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.239
That's when he went
to see Sloane.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.868
You gave Sydney
the call sign "Freelancer. "

12:56.942 --> 12:59.144
- Yes. That's right.
- Why?

12:59.145 --> 13:01.246
Because I didn't trust you.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.248
Consider it a paternal instinct.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.683
I'm telling you
because of Tippin's article.

13:05.684 --> 13:08.778
I should have had Tippin killed
months ago.

13:11.157 --> 13:14.456
Tippin's kidnapping led us
directly to Khasinau.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.294
Sydney destroyed their facility.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.630
Now Khasinau's organization
is fractured.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.395
Those who didn't lose
their lives are on the run.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.061
This is an opportunity.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.661
I understand
that I broke protocol.

13:26.739 --> 13:30.766
That The Alliance would have me
killed for what I've done.

13:30.843 --> 13:36.713
But if I weren't loyal
to you, Arvin, to SD-6...

13:36.782 --> 13:39.150
I would not have returned.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.452
- What about Tippin?
- It's insignificant.

13:41.453 --> 13:42.987
He doesn't know anything.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.752
And you can't kill him now.
It'll call attention.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.659
I will see to it that he never
writes another article again.

14:04.977 --> 14:08.572
Sloane just talked to me.

14:09.582 --> 14:14.178
There are times in life...

14:14.253 --> 14:18.519
when we don't listen
to our heart.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.318
To what we know to be true.

14:23.028 --> 14:28.432
In those moments,
we've lost who we are.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.901
We've betrayed ourselves.

14:33.539 --> 14:39.273
Questioning your loyalty,
your virtue...

14:39.345 --> 14:42.109
was one of those lost times
for me.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.859
Dixon is a good man.

14:56.762 --> 14:59.390
He still believes,
as I once did,

14:59.465 --> 15:03.299
that SD-6 is a classified
division of the CIA.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.168
That's the hardest part
about working undercover.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.267
Having to lie to the people
that you care about?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.251
- Anything from Vaughn?
- Nothing.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.386
What's being done?

15:21.387 --> 15:24.515
We've got a team in Taipei.
They searched the warehouse.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.958
- I searched the damn warehouse.
- They're tracking every lead.

15:26.959 --> 15:30.588
Don't give me the company line.
Vaughn might not be in Taipei!

15:30.663 --> 15:33.163
He's my friend, too.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.732
Sydney, I promise you,
we're looking as hard as we can.

15:37.569 --> 15:41.027
I know this is tough for you.
But you have to focus.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.606
I know.

15:43.809 --> 15:46.937
SD-6 wants to send me on
a mission to Cap Ferrat, France.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.680
Why? What's there?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.982
La Petite Rose.

15:50.983 --> 15:52.817
The estate of Jean-Marc Ravais.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.548
Member of the French
National Assembly.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.921
Since the destruction

15:56.922 --> 16:00.050
of Khasinau and Derevko's
headquarters in Taipei...

16:00.125 --> 16:01.693
thank you, Sydney...

16:01.694 --> 16:04.194
some of their organization
have been exposed.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.997
Ravais is one of those men.

16:05.998 --> 16:08.433
We believe he helped finance
their operation

16:08.434 --> 16:10.702
and is the key to finding
Khasinau,

16:10.703 --> 16:13.203
your mother, others who have
worked with them,

16:13.205 --> 16:14.839
and bringing them to justice.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.008
"Bringing them to justice. "
I love that.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.043
Arvin Sloane talking about
justice.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.979
What does Sloane want you to do?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.814
Your mission is to gain entry

16:22.815 --> 16:25.750
into Ravais' house
and plant a bug in his office,

16:25.818 --> 16:28.318
assuming that you're feeling
up to it.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.654
I'll be fine.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.692
Marshall.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.627
Thank you.

16:36.628 --> 16:37.795
Anyway. Uh, okay.

16:37.796 --> 16:40.424
What we have here is a phone.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.734
You might find...
It's talking to...

16:42.735 --> 16:46.068
"Hello. Mom. Yeah. Mom, no.
I will be there.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.663
Listen, is Aunt Ruthie
gonna be there?"

16:52.978 --> 16:55.279
Ubiquitous object
with infinite designs.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.781
Color, wiring, components.

16:56.782 --> 17:01.014
A guy like me, designing a bug,
first I have to figure out

17:01.086 --> 17:03.816
what type of model the phone is
that I'm bugging.

17:03.889 --> 17:07.586
And then I have to design it
so it's invisible.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.394
Welcome to a new age.

17:09.395 --> 17:12.364
This bug, it's in the wire.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.365
All right.
It's a universal design.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.434
Works on any phone.

17:16.435 --> 17:20.371
All you got to know is
what country the phone's in.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.272
How you doin'?

17:22.273 --> 17:25.209
Bug's in the wire.
That's good.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.578
We'll get CIA Tech to make you
a delay transmitter.

17:27.579 --> 17:31.606
We can control what SD-6 hears.
Meanwhile, CIA hears it all.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.889
Listen. About Vaughn.
I'm praying, too.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.096
So instead of going to Taipei,

17:45.097 --> 17:47.398
helping in the search
for Vaughn,

17:47.399 --> 17:49.634
I'm leaving for France
in half an hour.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.135
One more thing.

17:51.136 --> 17:54.196
You haven't said anything
about your mother.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.345
What am I supposed to say?
Something insightful?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.684
<i>The first time I see my mother
in 20 years,</i>

18:06.685 --> 18:08.019
she almost kills me.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.854
<i>Which would have made me the
13th CIA officer she's killed.</i>

18:11.924 --> 18:14.688
She's former KGB.
She's betrayed my father.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.161
She's betrayed me.
She's betrayed this country.

18:17.162 --> 18:21.599
All anyone needs to know about
that woman is she's a bad guy.

18:22.801 --> 18:25.136
I think this was
a good beginning.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.637
Like I said...

18:27.639 --> 18:30.506
I can handle
the problems I've got.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.656
Dr. Khasinau,
Mr. Ravais is calling.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.030
Bluebird, you close?

19:26.031 --> 19:28.531
Almost there.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.574
Damn it!

19:36.575 --> 19:37.942
You all right?

19:37.943 --> 19:40.605
Just my shoulder.
I'm good.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.958
Okay.
We go to stage one.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.560
Hors d'oeuvres are tasty.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.828
Don't forget.
You can bring me back a few.

19:57.829 --> 19:59.463
Can you get upstairs?

19:59.464 --> 20:01.964
I think so.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.675
Second door on the right?

20:10.676 --> 20:13.176
Yes.
Second door on the right.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.196
What's up?
We got a signal?

20:32.197 --> 20:34.697
Yeah.
We got a signal.

20:37.769 --> 20:40.966
<i>Un, deux, trois, quatre,
cinq, six.</i>

20:41.039 --> 20:43.539
Let's let SD-6 hear that.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.872
<i>Un, deux, trois, quatre,
cinq, six.</i>

20:46.945 --> 20:49.445
I got you, Bluebird.
Get out of there.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.148
<i>I'll be finished in 20 minutes.</i>

21:24.149 --> 21:26.649
Yes, sir.

22:53.505 --> 22:56.440
Vaughn, get up.
We have to get out of here.

22:59.611 --> 23:01.112
Come on.
Come on.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.613
They're gonna be back
in a second.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.054
Syd?

23:16.428 --> 23:19.761
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna
shoot you with adrenaline.

23:19.831 --> 23:22.331
We have got to run.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.967
Don't do that.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.939
Aah!

23:33.745 --> 23:36.305
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

23:49.828 --> 23:52.388
Ow. That hurt.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.565
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

23:54.566 --> 23:55.933
Where are we?

23:55.934 --> 23:57.668
France.

23:57.669 --> 23:59.804
France? Really?
France.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.572
There's too much to explain.

24:01.573 --> 24:03.641
I have to get back.

24:03.642 --> 24:06.270
You can get back
to Los Angeles, right?

24:08.079 --> 24:09.780
What?

24:09.781 --> 24:12.682
You saved my life.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.251
I'll see you back in L.A.

24:32.737 --> 24:35.797
So, the operation in France
must have gone well.

24:35.874 --> 24:38.175
Your spirits seem lifted.

24:38.176 --> 24:41.509
The doctor said Vaughn's
going to be all right, so...

24:47.052 --> 24:50.146
Okay, I see what you're
thinking, and the answer is no.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.722
There is no line being crossed.
He's my handler.

24:52.724 --> 24:55.784
Vaughn and I have
a professional relationship.

24:57.362 --> 25:01.992
Well, actually, I was thinking
about your reporter friend.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.335
Oh.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.710
Will isn't doing so well.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.545
In Taipei, he was tortured.

25:14.546 --> 25:17.174
But in some ways,
things have gotten even worse.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.350
The only way SD-6
will let you live

25:19.351 --> 25:21.979
is if you destroy
the life you've got.

25:22.053 --> 25:25.318
But you can't think
of another way than this?

25:25.390 --> 25:27.458
Yes, I can think of other ways.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.053
But they all involve
your burial.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.230
Is that your idea of a joke?

25:33.231 --> 25:35.731
You're morbid, Jack.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.801
You'll be taken to a drug house
in South Central.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.637
An hour later,
there will be a raid.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.440
The most critical thing is that
you face the press yourself.

25:48.513 --> 25:52.347
If you don't go public
with this, you'll be a dead man.

25:53.585 --> 25:56.085
I'm scared.

25:58.456 --> 26:00.956
I know.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.898
You ready?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.072
Heroin?

26:48.073 --> 26:52.100
Francie, I'll explain
everything later, okay?

26:52.177 --> 26:53.577
We should go out the back.

26:53.578 --> 26:56.604
There's a bunch of reporters
waiting for you.

26:56.681 --> 26:58.415
No. I want to go out
the front.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.718
- Mr. Tippin!
- Did SD-6 do this to you?

27:00.719 --> 27:04.951
Is it true you were found
with heroin in your blood?

27:05.023 --> 27:08.424
My problem with heroin
goes back three years.

27:08.493 --> 27:11.985
I'm embarrassed for myself
and my family when I tell you

27:12.063 --> 27:15.123
most of what I've written during
that time has been fiction,

27:15.200 --> 27:18.431
including my most recent report

27:18.503 --> 27:21.438
about an organization
that I called SD-6.

27:21.506 --> 27:24.006
These were desperate...

27:25.377 --> 27:30.144
As hard as that is to watch,
your friend is very lucky.

27:30.215 --> 27:33.480
It could have ended up
much worse.

27:33.551 --> 27:36.987
You know how much
I care about you, Sydney.

27:37.789 --> 27:41.452
I did it for you.
Spared Will's life.

27:41.526 --> 27:45.121
I didn't want to see you lose
someone else to SD-6.

27:46.931 --> 27:49.431
Thank you.

27:49.734 --> 27:52.294
And there's something else.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.870
Something I want to ask you.

27:56.074 --> 27:57.408
It would mean a great deal

27:57.409 --> 27:59.969
if you would speak
at Emily's service.

28:16.227 --> 28:17.428
You okay?

28:17.429 --> 28:19.830
Fantastic.

28:30.909 --> 28:33.409
He's in the bathroom.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.314
How bad?

28:37.315 --> 28:40.079
It's just...

28:40.151 --> 28:42.651
bad.

28:43.054 --> 28:47.013
Look, I have to meet
with my realtor.

28:47.926 --> 28:50.690
I'll be back in an hour.
Can you watch him?

28:50.762 --> 28:52.896
Yeah.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.365
Francie.

28:55.366 --> 28:57.866
He's gonna be okay.

29:01.706 --> 29:03.640
I was just sitting there...

29:03.641 --> 29:07.304
putting my stuff from my desk
into this cardboard box.

29:07.378 --> 29:08.378
And I look up,

29:08.379 --> 29:11.815
and everybody from the office
is just staring at me.

29:11.883 --> 29:15.216
So I left my office this
afternoon for the last time.

29:15.286 --> 29:17.786
I got a lot of,
"Take care, man. "

29:17.822 --> 29:21.258
- I got a lot of that.
- I'm so sorry, Will.

29:21.326 --> 29:24.557
Hey, I'm sitting here.

29:24.629 --> 29:26.296
I'm on a couch.

29:26.297 --> 29:28.797
I'm alive.

29:32.270 --> 29:35.137
Is anybody listening to us
right now?

29:35.206 --> 29:37.706
No.

29:37.742 --> 29:41.234
That lamp has a bug killer
in it, so we're safe here.

29:41.312 --> 29:44.406
Hey, how's your mouth?

29:46.284 --> 29:48.784
I'm gonna be fine.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.188
I lose my health insurance

29:51.189 --> 29:53.157
the same day
I need a root canal.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.858
Oh.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.167
Who is it?

30:05.503 --> 30:09.405
Just say "good guys"
or "bad guys. " I'll understand.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.974
Good guys.

30:12.577 --> 30:15.077
Hey.

30:23.755 --> 30:26.519
When I was a kid,
I was a swimmer.

30:26.591 --> 30:30.823
<i>I could swim the 100 meters
in 68 seconds.</i>

30:30.895 --> 30:33.063
I can't tell you
how irrelevant that was

30:33.064 --> 30:35.794
that night we were in Taipei.

30:35.867 --> 30:40.270
There have been some incredible
inventions over the years.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.501
But none more incredible
than the screwdriver.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.075
None.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.688
I thought I was home free.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.194
But they knocked me out.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.695
Next thing I knew,
I was in France.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.565
When I saw you
behind that window,

31:08.566 --> 31:11.660
I swear to God,
I thought you were dead.

31:16.207 --> 31:19.335
We intercepted a call from one
of Khasinau's operatives.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.004
They made reference
to something called "the bible. "

31:22.080 --> 31:23.313
- What is it?
- A book.

31:23.314 --> 31:25.649
An operations manual
for their cartel.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.150
Contacts, weapons and tech
inventory, objectives.

31:28.219 --> 31:32.155
Information Khasinau
and your mother need to rebuild.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.192
If we retrieve this book,
we can prevent that.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.161
- Any idea where this bible is?
- It was Taipei.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.097
When the lab was destroyed,

31:40.098 --> 31:43.090
this operative who called
Khasinau grabbed the book.

31:43.167 --> 31:45.535
He's planning on handing it
to Khasinau tomorrow

31:45.536 --> 31:48.664
at the Port of Barcelona,
pier 347.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.402
- Does SD-6 know?
- That's what's so genius.

31:51.476 --> 31:54.809
The delay transmitter lets us
control the signal.

31:54.879 --> 31:56.546
We didn't let them
hear the call.

31:56.547 --> 32:00.449
You're going to Spain.
You leave in 30 minutes.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.034
Anything?

32:17.035 --> 32:18.402
Not yet.

32:18.403 --> 32:22.066
So, there's some really good
restaurants in Barcelona.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.774
Yeah, I know.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.809
You know what I was thinking?

32:25.810 --> 32:27.177
I think I do.

32:27.178 --> 32:28.946
If we could be seen in public,

32:28.947 --> 32:31.415
we'd get the bible
and get a bite.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.249
Yeah, can the whole team come?
We're starving.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.528
Okay.
We've got Khasinau.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.321
Everyone hold position.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.822
Get ready to move.

33:29.674 --> 33:33.542
The courier's got a briefcase.
It's got to be the bible.

33:38.783 --> 33:41.650
We move in on 3.

33:41.719 --> 33:44.219
Everybody into position.

33:53.097 --> 33:55.597
<i>1...</i>

33:56.534 --> 33:59.034
<i>2...</i>

33:59.404 --> 34:01.204
- Get out now!
- Out of the car!

34:01.205 --> 34:03.765
- Let me see your hands!
- Drop the case!

34:03.841 --> 34:05.075
Out of the car!

34:05.076 --> 34:06.576
Down on the ground!
Now!

34:06.577 --> 34:08.879
Drop the case!
Drop the case!

34:08.880 --> 34:11.081
Let me see your hands!
Out of the car!

34:11.081 --> 34:12.081
Cover him!

34:12.083 --> 34:15.780
Now! Right now!
Right now!

34:33.071 --> 34:34.704
Who the hell is firing?

34:34.705 --> 34:36.907
Weiss, I'm going after
the shooter.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.042
Bravo team,
take the dry dock to the west!

34:39.043 --> 34:41.568
- Charlie team, to the east!
- Weiss!

34:48.052 --> 34:49.052
It's okay.

34:49.053 --> 34:52.022
It's okay. Relax.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.458
Freeze!

35:29.794 --> 35:32.388
Drop the suitcase.

35:33.764 --> 35:36.733
Hands behind your head.
On your knees.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.435
Drop it.

37:06.824 --> 37:09.588
Hands behind your head.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.160
Get on your knees.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.072
Head to the ground.

37:40.124 --> 37:42.624
Truth takes time.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.859
Do you have a minute?

38:15.860 --> 38:18.360
You all right?

38:20.431 --> 38:22.365
Have you heard?

38:22.366 --> 38:23.600
What?

38:23.601 --> 38:26.101
Sit down.

38:35.346 --> 38:37.681
I had Emily's funeral
this morning.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.015
Sloane's wife.

38:39.016 --> 38:41.917
You're eulogizing
the bastard's wife?

38:41.986 --> 38:44.486
- Yes.
- The devil's wife?

38:44.488 --> 38:46.856
The wife of the guy
who had Danny killed.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.485
The guy who wanted to kill me.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.893
Despite being married
to a truly horrible man,

38:52.963 --> 38:55.625
Emily was a good person.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.726
If the people who cared about
her don't speak because of him,

38:58.803 --> 39:00.804
there's no justice in that.

39:00.805 --> 39:03.305
It just makes him stronger.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.342
You can't see
this bruise, right?

39:11.015 --> 39:13.515
So this is what your life is?

39:13.517 --> 39:16.714
Lying to everybody all the time.

39:16.787 --> 39:20.985
I've only been doing it for
a few days, and it's killing me.

39:21.058 --> 39:23.558
When you found out about me...

39:24.395 --> 39:26.596
I was just terrified.

39:26.597 --> 39:30.089
Because I saw what happened
when Danny learned the truth.

39:32.036 --> 39:37.531
But I was also selfishly
so relieved.

39:37.608 --> 39:40.076
Because it meant that you knew.

39:40.077 --> 39:43.808
That I didn't have to think
every time we spoke.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.381
I could just be me.

39:46.851 --> 39:49.185
Hello?

39:49.186 --> 39:51.254
We're back here.

39:51.255 --> 39:53.755
No bruises.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:57.661 --> 40:00.130
I got the space.
I'm opening a restaurant.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.965
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.466
Thank you.

40:05.703 --> 40:09.366
I met Emily shortly after
I started working

40:09.440 --> 40:12.204
at Credit Dauphine.

40:12.276 --> 40:15.541
Like many young women,
I was intimidated...

40:15.613 --> 40:17.947
by the world.

40:17.948 --> 40:20.746
I was sort of desperate
for a little guidance.

40:20.818 --> 40:25.687
As he had been for most of my
life, my father was working.

40:25.756 --> 40:29.658
I had lost my mother
when I was 6.

40:29.727 --> 40:33.390
So I didn't have anyone
to go to.

40:33.464 --> 40:35.632
No role model.

40:35.633 --> 40:39.091
Arvin invited me for dinner
one night.

40:40.604 --> 40:45.166
I remember
after dinner was over...

40:45.242 --> 40:48.040
Emily walked me out to the car.

40:50.181 --> 40:53.082
I didn't know her at all.

40:53.150 --> 40:59.521
And she said in this simple,
reassuring voice...

41:01.292 --> 41:03.792
"You're gonna be okay. "

41:08.265 --> 41:11.860
Thinking of Emily, I often
wondered about my own mother

41:11.936 --> 41:17.465
and what she would have
been like had she lived.

41:18.909 --> 41:23.369
Would she have been as strong
as Emily, or as kind?

41:23.447 --> 41:25.947
As good?

41:26.984 --> 41:31.182
I always told myself that she
would have had those qualities.

41:31.255 --> 41:34.782
And though I couldn't
see them...

41:34.859 --> 41:37.160
I simply believed them.

41:37.161 --> 41:41.655
But Emily wasn't just
the mother I never had.

41:43.234 --> 41:46.931
She was the mother
all of us wish we had.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.366
Dad?

42:16.367 --> 42:18.801
Devlin just called.

42:18.802 --> 42:21.302
CIA had a walk-in.

42:22.306 --> 42:25.764
She just surrendered.

42:25.843 --> 42:27.877
She said she wants to cooperate.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.378
Who?

42:31.482 --> 42:33.982
Your mother.

42:44.361 --> 42:49.230
I'm not sure this is a problem
I know how to handle.
