01:08.720 --> 01:10.640
The night before we left,
I couldn't sleep.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.311
I couldn't stop thinking
about Chris Kanew,

01:13.920 --> 01:14.920
and how he quit,

01:14.960 --> 01:16.154
and all the things he said.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.560
Brad, I loved working
with you so much,

01:21.640 --> 01:24.916
and I learned a lot from you,
but this job has made me...

01:25.920 --> 01:27.353
kind of depressed.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.160
I thought about
how I'd taught this kid everything I knew,

01:30.560 --> 01:32.039
and how he was my only employee,

01:32.120 --> 01:34.953
and... how pathetic it all was.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.637
Then my mind drifted to the dinner party.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.759
And the Architectural Digest.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.176
She has a teenage daughter.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.315
They call that...

01:49.400 --> 01:51.436
- Oh, is that it? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.456
We were talking about cheese.
You got to try this.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.471
This is, like, an imitation ComtÃ©.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.080
- Really?
- But instead of organic...

01:58.520 --> 02:00.476
Isn't that
your friend from college?

02:01.440 --> 02:03.192
Brad has this friend from college...

02:03.280 --> 02:05.589
I knew Nick had become
rich and successful, but...

02:06.960 --> 02:08.359
I felt gut-punched.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.835
I felt like the world was
rubbing my nose in something.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.475
So many friends from college
have become successful.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.835
Nick Pascale was
a big movie director in Hollywood,

02:37.600 --> 02:39.795
living this crazy, decadent life.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.878
Jason Hatfield had his own hedge fund.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.388
Obscenely rich.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.709
Owns three houses.

02:51.720 --> 02:52.835
Big philanthropist.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.831
Billy Wearslter sold
his tech company at 40.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.071
He's already retired,
living a life of leisure in Maui.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.440
Craig Fisher worked for the White House.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.800
He's written all these best-sellers.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.595
Always on TV.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.998
It's stupid to compare lives.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
But when I do,

03:35.440 --> 03:36.714
I feel somehow I failed.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.070
And over time, these feelings get worse.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.789
Brad.
Shit.

03:52.920 --> 03:53.920
Oh, my.
Sorry.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.320
You okay?

03:56.240 --> 03:58.959
What the hell?
You just... you just hit me in the face.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
Oh, sorry.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.954
It's okay.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.639
Can't sleep.
Mm.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.360
How much do you think
your parents' house is worth?

04:10.760 --> 04:12.079
My parents' house?

04:13.240 --> 04:14.240
I don't know.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.875
Like, uh, two million?

04:17.839 --> 04:18.839
Two and a half?

04:19.120 --> 04:20.120
I don't know.

04:21.839 --> 04:22.920
You never thought about it?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.035
What does it matter?

04:26.040 --> 04:27.960
Well, aren't you getting
the house when they die?

04:28.920 --> 04:29.920
When they die?

04:31.040 --> 04:34.112
I think they're considering
leaving it all to the grandkids.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.516
What do you mean?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.160
Like, splitting everything
between the grandkids.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.271
What? Steve has three kids.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.915
He's already rich. We only have one.
How's that fair?

04:44.560 --> 04:45.754
It's not up to me.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.511
They also talked about just giving it all
to charity, so, who knows?

04:49.800 --> 04:50.800
Seriously?

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
That's absurd.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.709
Seriously, that's mean.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.793
You work for a nonprofit,
and you think that's absurd?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.674
Right, I work for a nonprofit.
You work for the government.

05:02.640 --> 05:03.640
We need the money.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.158
Look, I'm gonna be so distraught
when my parents die,

05:07.320 --> 05:09.151
I'm not gonna give a fuck about the money.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
Really?

05:12.160 --> 05:13.160
Not at all?

05:15.160 --> 05:16.160
Think you will.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.480
What about your dad?

05:19.080 --> 05:20.354
You have money coming to you.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.317
Oh, he's an academic. I mean...

05:23.840 --> 05:25.432
two hundred thousand, maybe.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.556
Well, that'll help pay for Troy's college.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.600
Is that why you're worrying about money?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.560
We'll be fine.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.275
We'll figure it out.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.633
We didn't work this hard
to end up dying in a flophouse, you know?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.080
All right, you're freaking me out.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.040
I just feel like
we're running out of time.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.873
It's like there's no more potential.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
This is it.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.520
We've plateaued.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.160
It's not like there's gonna be some...

06:01.160 --> 06:04.789
windfall that, you know,
suddenly changes our situation.

06:04.880 --> 06:05.880
I mean...

06:06.920 --> 06:08.956
We're not poor, Brad.
I kn...

06:11.200 --> 06:12.679
In some circles, yeah.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.554
Oh, what circles? The one percent?

06:19.280 --> 06:20.508
We have a great life.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
Go to sleep.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.856
Do you think you should
talk to your parents?

06:28.880 --> 06:30.000
Then we'll get some clarity.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.073
You and I are done.
I love you.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.160
Please shut up.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
Troy?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.520
Troy, are you up?

07:14.720 --> 07:17.359
Oh, yes. Hello.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
What is your name?

07:19.800 --> 07:20.949
I know your name.

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
You have ten minutes.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.759
Uh, yeah, I'm ready.
I just got to put on my clothes.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.795
Can you give me a second?

07:37.960 --> 07:38.870
Yeah.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.190
You have, like, the body of a man now.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.230
Hey, Dad, can you not be weird?
'Cause I'm stressed.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.160
Okay.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.800
Can you close my door?

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
Yeah.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.120
Can you close the door?

07:51.560 --> 07:52.560
Yeah.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.675
Yeah, it looks good.
Did you bring a jacket?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
- Yeah.
- Okay. It's gonna get cold.

08:03.040 --> 08:03.677
- Yeah.
- Oh,

08:03.760 --> 08:05.136
I think you guys are gonna like this.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.880
Yeah, I think
it'll be good, I guess.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.840
On the ride to the airport,

08:10.120 --> 08:12.156
I kept thinking
about what Chris Kanew said.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.160
So, wait a minute,
you're going into banking?

08:16.640 --> 08:19.916
Look, Brad, I honestly think
I can do so much more good

08:20.000 --> 08:22.195
by making a lot of money
and then giving it away,

08:22.280 --> 08:24.475
instead of spending all my time
asking other people

08:24.560 --> 08:25.959
for their money to give away.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.475
You know what I mean?

08:32.320 --> 08:33.655
You have
all the hotel information, right?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.953
Yeah, Mom. It's on my phone.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.336
Would you forward it to your dad?

08:36.360 --> 08:38.760
I don't think he has any sense
of the schedule. Do you, Brad?

08:39.760 --> 08:42.159
I don't think he has any idea,
so, it's really on you, honey.

08:42.360 --> 08:42.996
Okay.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.992
There are moments you realize
your entire life's work is absurd

08:47.080 --> 08:48.456
and you have nothing to show for it.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.536
...- the deputies of Kim Jong-il.
- Yeah.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.816
Or maybe it was Kim Jong-un.
Was it Kim Jong-un or Kim Jong-il?

08:54.840 --> 08:56.717
- Was it the father?
- It was ll.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.080
That's the father.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.033
Some guys have empires.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
What do I have?

09:03.280 --> 09:04.554
I live in Sacramento,

09:04.920 --> 09:07.480
a secondary market
surrounded by mediocrities

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
and beta males.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.108
...this piece on NPR.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.033
It was an interview. It was Terry Gross
with All Things Considered.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.216
But the guy... you were telling
about the guy in the prison before,

09:16.240 --> 09:17.856
- the vegetarian guy, right?
- Oh, yeah.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.757
In this... It's a private prison
in Georgia.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.514
And they have meat in every dish.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.736
This guy just said,
"I'm gonna stop eating meat."

09:24.760 --> 09:27.480
So, they got him tied down.
They're force-feeding him through a tube.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.952
And he just keeps saying,
"Vegetables. Vegetarian. Fruit."

09:34.640 --> 09:36.320
This is not where I thought I'd be.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.233
It's not the life I imagined.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.320
Oh, honey,
this is gonna be so cool.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.080
This is great.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.720
Mom, I think I'm just gonna take
Old River Road, connect to the freeway.

09:52.440 --> 09:53.936
For your safety and security...

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
This good?

09:55.120 --> 09:56.120
Yeah.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.256
Call me all the time.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.430
I want to know everything.
This is so exciting.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.696
- Yeah, thanks, Mom.
- I love you.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.835
All right. Should be good.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.833
I can't believe this.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.114
This is crazy.
I know.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.416
It just feels like a big moment.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.240
I'm so jealous. I can't believe
I have to go to this stupid conference.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.616
Okay, flight info's all on your phone,

10:22.640 --> 10:24.336
and the hotels, it's all on there, okay?
Great, okay.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.136
- All right, be happy. Be present.
- Love you.

10:26.160 --> 10:26.956
All right.
I love you.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.416
- Love you, honey.
- Okay.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.793
Oh, take lots of pictures!

10:32.200 --> 10:32.950
Love you!

10:33.040 --> 10:34.040
Love you!

10:34.960 --> 10:36.480
Attention, all departing passengers...

10:41.640 --> 10:42.959
Economy entrance is that line.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.789
But, uh, I have a, uh, Silver Flyer card.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.674
It's Gold and Platinum only.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.320
Next, please.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.320
Enjoy your flight.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.480
You know what I'm thinking?

11:37.720 --> 11:38.720
Hmm?

11:38.880 --> 11:39.915
Let's try for an upgrade.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.080
What do you mean?

11:43.200 --> 11:44.440
Going off to find your college.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.801
And I don't know when you and I
are gonna take a trip like this again.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.513
Let's fly business, okay?

11:51.120 --> 11:52.120
Really?
Yeah.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.029
Okay. Cool.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.391
I, uh, I never flown business.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.118
Let's make this fucking special, okay?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.315
Okay.
All right.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.790
Oh! Good news.
There are two seats available in business.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.880
Oh!

12:11.480 --> 12:13.240
Can I see
your tickets, please?

12:13.320 --> 12:14.320
Awesome.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.198
Yeah.
Thank you.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.396
Yeah. I was hoping to put it on my miles.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.200
I got a bunch of miles, I think.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.709
Unfortunately, no, not with this flight,
you can't.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.679
So...
cost to upgrade to business

12:26.760 --> 12:29.194
would be $821 per ticket.
Mm.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.230
So, the total would be $1,642.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.750
Sixteen hundred dollars?
That's... for a domestic flight?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.068
Yes, $1,642.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.040
Would you like to go ahead
and purchase the tickets?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.509
I...

12:44.600 --> 12:45.600
I'm gonna go for it.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.748
Go for it. I can put it on my Amex.
Actually... Sorry, no.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.148
Put it on my MasterCard.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.599
Thanks.
Gonna put it on the Amex. Just...

12:57.360 --> 12:58.031
Okay.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.111
Sorry.
Great. Let me just run that.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.670
Yeah, it's a... once-in-a-lifetime thing.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.230
Mm-hmm. Mr. Sloan, actually...
Yeah?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.675
...unfortunately, we can't upgrade you.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.279
I'm sorry.
What? Why not?

13:12.760 --> 13:15.672
Seems as though you bought those tickets
on a discounted website,

13:15.760 --> 13:18.752
and with that type of ticket,
we can't do the upgrade.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.356
Okay.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.796
But... not even if I pay you $1,600?

13:24.880 --> 13:27.599
There's actually no amount of money
you can pay to get an upgrade.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.080
I'm so sorry.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
Anything else?

13:30.680 --> 13:33.035
Um... no.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.270
It's not a big deal, anyway.

13:36.160 --> 13:36.751
Okay.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.478
And what if I'm a Silver Flyer member?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.080
I'm sorry.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120
Next?
Okay.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.976
Right on the beach.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Really?

13:44.520 --> 13:45.536
- Champagne?
- That sounds like...

13:45.560 --> 13:46.576
- Oh!
- There you are.

13:46.600 --> 13:47.396
Thanks.
Thank you.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.993
Yes. Enjoy your flight.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.360
Sorry I couldn't get us the upgrade.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.669
It's not a big deal.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.311
Silver Flyer card.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.556
Means nothing.

14:16.640 --> 14:17.709
Gets you nothing at all.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.240
Well, then get rid of it.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.313
Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm tossing it.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.395
Should I? I should, right?

14:25.800 --> 14:26.800
Mm-hmm.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
Stupid...

14:34.480 --> 14:35.913
I'll keep it for now.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.416
I couldn't help but wonder:

14:50.440 --> 14:52.954
When was the last time
Craig Fisher flew economy?

14:54.560 --> 14:55.629
Probably not in decades.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.720
Mr. Fisher?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.194
Can I offer you a warm towel?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.799
A warm towel.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.069
Yes, thank you.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.296
What are you two doing?

15:08.320 --> 15:10.754
And now Jason Hatfield
has his own private plane.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.318
Never has to fly commercial at all.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.590
Nick Pascale probably flies private, too.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.475
Thank you so much.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.714
Must be nice to always have
the seas part for you.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.509
Nothing's out of reach.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.200
Can I have this one?

15:37.280 --> 15:38.395
- Okay.
- Yeah? Oh.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.840
Everything an option.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.760
Must be like a drug.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.633
Always feeling important and special.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Better than.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.400
And all the adventures.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.919
The exotic destinations.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.440
Au revoir!

16:00.720 --> 16:02.560
For them,
the world isn't a battlefield.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.280
It's a playground.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
A dream.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.154
It's heaven, manifested.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.360
Dad, can I get some Pringles?
They're seven dollars.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.520
- Yeah.
- I need your credit card.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.429
There are 45 minutes left on the flight.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.159
Keep your seat belt fastened.
Enjoy the rest of the flight.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.270
Eventually,
my mind drifted back to college.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.400
Back then, I was in love with the world

16:50.880 --> 16:52.359
and the world was in love with me.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.600
When did we fall out of love
with each other?

17:08.880 --> 17:09.920
Where did it all go wrong?

17:16.440 --> 17:17.792
My thoughts turned to Melanie.

17:18.920 --> 17:19.715
It's unbelievable.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.800
It's fucked up.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.627
They've got kids...
little elementary school kids...

17:23.880 --> 17:26.553
doing these mass-shooting drills
in their schools,

17:26.640 --> 17:28.536
because everybody has to have a gun,
because that's the answer...

17:28.560 --> 17:31.199
I love Melanie's idealism,
but maybe that idealism

17:31.320 --> 17:32.878
prevented me from ever selling out.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.035
Jason Hatfield married a woman
who had money of her own.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.635
She introduced him to rich clients,
gave him entrÃ©e and status.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.392
Diane Fisher's famous in her own right.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.840
She and Craig competed with each other,

17:49.920 --> 17:51.512
pushing each other to succeed.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.030
Here.
Oh.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.120
But Melanie...

17:55.520 --> 17:57.272
she's so easily satisfied.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.360
It's good.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.159
Seriously?
Yeah!

18:00.640 --> 18:02.392
Honestly?
Yeah, I always love your sauces.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.296
Maybe her contentment
undermined my ambition.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.320
Okay.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.148
Hey. Hi, honey.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.190
Hey, you in Boston?

18:17.280 --> 18:18.280
Yep. We made it.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.360
Yeah, we're on our way to the hotel.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.920
Oh, good. How's Troy doing?

18:22.320 --> 18:23.435
He's good.
Good.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.834
Yeah. He's, uh, drinking in Boston.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.392
And I'll tell you something:
I know exactly what the...

18:43.640 --> 18:45.517
I can't blame Melanie
for my decisions,

18:45.840 --> 18:46.840
or anyone else.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.680
It's my fault.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.800
Dad.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.473
You want to get some food? All I've eaten
today is the can of Pringles.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.397
Yeah. Let's do it. I'm hungry, too.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.718
Yeah. Let's get some food.

19:15.680 --> 19:19.229
And then, uh, Thursday, rent a car
and drive to Amherst and then Williams.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.959
You know,
these are competitive schools, Troy.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.315
Just... just try not to put
too much pressure on yourself.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
You know what I mean?

19:26.480 --> 19:28.391
Don't get caught up
in the game, all the brands.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.509
You know, "Williams,"
"Harvard," all of it.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.999
Just... It all works out.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.976
In the end, you end up at the right place.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.096
Mm, yeah, I'm not really worried.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.120
Okay.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.191
You know, when I was your age,
I was so freaked out about college.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.760
I wanted to go to Yale.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.353
Was just obsessed, right?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I mean, why Yale?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.320
I didn't know why.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.636
And then, uh, I got waitlisted,
and then I didn't get in.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.040
Right?

19:55.200 --> 19:56.200
Guess what?

19:57.040 --> 19:58.040
It all worked out.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
I loved Tufts.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.593
Tufts was a fantastic school.

20:01.720 --> 20:02.835
I made great friends.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.350
I met that professor, Bob Connor,

20:05.720 --> 20:07.000
took me under his wing and just,

20:07.720 --> 20:10.109
you know, kind of blew my mind
and changed my life.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.440
Made me want to save the world.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.040
So...

20:14.760 --> 20:17.320
Anyway, my point is, fuck Yale, okay?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.152
And you don't get into Tufts, fuck Tufts.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.550
My, uh, counselor thinks
that I'll get into Yale.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.199
She does?
He does, yeah.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.551
He does. Why does he think that?

20:32.720 --> 20:35.712
Uh, I mean, I guess my grades
and scores and my compositions,

20:35.800 --> 20:38.917
'cause I guess a lot of these schools
are looking to fill orchestral spots.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.312
And, uh, he's pretty confident

20:41.400 --> 20:43.231
I'll get into pretty much
everywhere I apply.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.080
You look stunned.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.400
He thinks you're gonna get into Yale?

20:54.600 --> 20:55.510
Yes.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.874
Really? That's amazing.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.798
I mean, I knew you had
good grades and I...

20:58.880 --> 21:00.376
you know, I always thought
you were a genius,

21:00.400 --> 21:01.435
but I just...

21:02.200 --> 21:03.633
That's so awesome, Troy.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.594
But we're not, um, visiting Yale.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.311
Uh, yeah, I don't really
want to go to Yale.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.476
Why not?

21:13.560 --> 21:15.790
Um... well, I'm hoping
that I get into Harvard,

21:15.920 --> 21:18.256
'cause there's this, uh,
there's this music professor there,

21:18.280 --> 21:19.554
this guy, Jerome Backaly,

21:19.640 --> 21:22.359
and he's doing, like,
a lot of really cool stuff and...

21:23.120 --> 21:24.640
Yeah, it's just a really cool program.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.833
My, uh, friend from school,

21:26.920 --> 21:28.797
she says that there's
a concert Wednesday night

21:28.880 --> 21:31.110
that she's playing,
and he might be there, so...

21:35.120 --> 21:36.120
S...

21:38.440 --> 21:40.556
You're going to Harvard.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.080
Well, maybe. You know, I don't know.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.400
Does your mother know about this?

21:44.440 --> 21:45.953
Well, she knows I want to.
I...

21:46.320 --> 21:49.312
I can't believe...
I didn't know about this.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.496
What do you mean?
You knew that we were coming here.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.397
I knew we were checking out the school,

21:53.480 --> 21:56.153
but I didn't know you were
actually gonna get in.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.919
Well, I might not get in.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.560
But it seems like you might.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
Well, yeah, I might.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.560
My kid's going to Harvard.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.153
Don't fucking jinx me, dude.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.754
You all right?
Yeah.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.309
Life's crazy, huh?

22:24.160 --> 22:25.160
I mean...

22:27.160 --> 22:28.160
how cool.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.200
I'm proud of you.

22:50.360 --> 22:53.511
Sometimes in life,
you can lose the plot.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.160
You want to play something, buddy?

23:03.720 --> 23:06.393
I suddenly remembered what I'd been doing
for the last 17 years.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.519
Planting and nurturing
for this amazing creature.

23:18.840 --> 23:19.989
How could I have regrets?

23:26.600 --> 23:29.640
If I had stayed in New York
and married a striver like Diane Fisher...

23:30.240 --> 23:31.958
No, that is bullshit...

23:32.040 --> 23:34.120
...Troy could've turned out
entitled and pretentious.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.960
- Dad, don't be so cisgender.
- Come on.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.600
- Yeah, Dad, don't be so cis.
- You've got to look at what...

23:39.480 --> 23:40.696
If I'd pursued money and power,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.517
he might've become
a spoiled little monster.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.871
Save one for me!

23:45.960 --> 23:47.109
Yeah!

23:51.040 --> 23:52.040
Toblerone?

23:52.480 --> 23:53.754
Oh. Thanks.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.759
Thank God for Sacramento.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.720
What?

24:06.440 --> 24:09.352
Oh! Checking your phone?
Are you ticklish? Tickle Man?

24:09.440 --> 24:10.856
- Do you remember Tickle Man?
- No.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.950
- You used to love this. Tickle, tickle.
- No.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.189
- Come on.
- Please stop.

24:14.280 --> 24:14.951
Oh, yeah, I got...

24:15.040 --> 24:16.075
Oh!

24:19.960 --> 24:21.359
Whoa! Oh, my God!

24:21.480 --> 24:23.277
Okay, stop. Troy, Troy, seriously, stop.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Okay.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.069
Whoa! Troy!

24:43.480 --> 24:45.640
That night, I imagine
Troy getting into Harvard,

24:46.640 --> 24:48.312
and the satisfactions it would bring.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.631
Hey! Hey, guys!

24:52.560 --> 24:53.560
Hey!

24:55.320 --> 24:56.320
I got in!

24:57.760 --> 24:59.910
I got in!

25:01.640 --> 25:02.993
Oh! Harvard!

25:03.240 --> 25:04.912
Hey!

25:05.000 --> 25:06.319
All right, buddy!

25:06.960 --> 25:07.960
Harvard!

25:32.080 --> 25:33.360
Not a bad place to go to school.

25:33.920 --> 25:34.920
No.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.240
Wow.

25:41.760 --> 25:42.954
This is where you go.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.155
Let's go. Let's go.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.037
You have a son or a daughter?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.991
A son, yes. He's interviewing.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.520
Mine, too.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.480
Yeah, my son is a, uh,
very talented musician.

26:41.920 --> 26:42.920
Keyboards.

26:43.880 --> 26:44.880
Pianist.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.280
Yeah.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.115
Also composes his own music, so...

26:51.360 --> 26:52.360
Wonderful.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.233
Looks like he's gonna have
a lot of decisions to make.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
Mm.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.520
But I'm pretty sure Harvard is,
uh, gonna be in the running.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.480
Oh, you think Harvard's got a chance?

27:07.040 --> 27:08.792
Uh, what does your son do?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.797
What does he do?
He's a student in high school.

27:14.760 --> 27:15.760
Right. Okay.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.680
Hey.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.600
What's going on? Is it over?

27:22.760 --> 27:25.433
Uh... no, I got the day wrong.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.120
What?

27:27.720 --> 27:29.040
I got the... I got the day wrong.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.080
It's yesterday.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.000
Yesterday? What do you mean?

27:32.800 --> 27:35.136
Yeah, I mean, I don't know,
I fucked it up. It was yesterday.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.549
Well, did they... did they give
you a time to come back?

27:38.840 --> 27:40.876
Um... no, I mean, I think
they're really booked up.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.056
But they said, like,
I can just do an alumni interview

27:43.080 --> 27:45.071
back in Sacramento.
No. No.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.236
No, you want to do it
with one of these guys.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.276
I mean, these are the guys that decide.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.160
Right?

27:51.680 --> 27:55.229
Dad, I'm just gonna go on the tour.
It's not... this isn't a big deal.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.856
It's a big deal. I'm gonna talk to them.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.440
- What? You don't need to talk to them.
- Yes, I do.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.320
Listen, we didn't come all this way
for you to interview in Sacramento.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.158
Excuse me. Sir? Hi.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.710
Oh, I'd love to be able
to accommodate you guys,

28:09.800 --> 28:11.631
but our schedule's been set
for months now.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.656
I want you to get a sense of my son.
Harvard is his first choice...

28:14.680 --> 28:16.033
Hey, Dad, it's okay.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.190
He's a pianist. He does community service.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.256
His counselor says he's Harvard material.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.350
It's not necessary to interview here.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.556
Alumni interviews are just as effective.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
Well, I... Okay.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.798
I mean... I mean,
I know how important face time is.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.600
You know, we're here. Come on.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.393
Don't shine us on. I mean...
Dad.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.440
No. Can't you just sit with us
for ten minutes?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
I mean, he's right here.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.112
What are you guys doing right now?

28:38.400 --> 28:39.799
I have a staff meeting, sir.

28:40.040 --> 28:43.191
Dad, please,
please, please, please stop.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.077
- Please stop.
- Okay. I'll stop, okay.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.038
Okay. All right. Thank you.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.239
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.856
Dad, what the fuck? You think
arguing with the admissions officer

28:58.880 --> 29:00.800
is gonna help my chances?
He won't remember this.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.640
I think he will.
You know, I don't understand.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.989
How can someone who has the brains
to get into Harvard

29:05.080 --> 29:07.376
not have the brain to remember
what day he made an appointment

29:07.400 --> 29:08.719
so he can get into Harvard?

29:10.680 --> 29:12.256
I'm sorry. Can we please talk and, like,

29:12.280 --> 29:14.880
walk somewhere else, please,
'cause they're about to start a tour.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.558
So what?
So, I don't want everybody

29:16.640 --> 29:18.517
seeing me getting bitched-out
by my dad, okay?

29:18.600 --> 29:19.953
I'm not bitching you out.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.520
I'm trying to solve a problem here.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.638
I know you think you got this in the bag,
but this is Harvard, Troy.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.999
Even geniuses get rejected.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.120
Oh, my God.

29:30.440 --> 29:31.236
You realize you're competing

29:31.320 --> 29:34.392
with kids from Hong Kong
and everywhere, okay?

29:34.760 --> 29:36.512
You're a white kid from the suburbs

29:36.600 --> 29:38.591
without a sob story,
and you're not even a legacy.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.176
We're the underdogs here.
We need to do everything we can.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.475
Dad, I'm about to flip
the fuck out. Please shut up.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.471
Okay, let me think. Just...

29:49.040 --> 29:50.736
Okay, why don't you go
on the tour, and I'm...

29:50.760 --> 29:53.354
I'm gonna, um...
What are you gonna do?

29:53.560 --> 29:54.959
I'm gonna make some calls.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.918
Just don't do anything uncool.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.230
Hey.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.276
Hey. So, Troy messed up,

30:13.360 --> 30:15.520
and we're at Harvard,
and he doesn't have an interview.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.680
He got the day wrong.

30:17.480 --> 30:18.680
Do we know anybody at Harvard?

30:19.440 --> 30:21.240
I really want to get him an interview.
I mean,

30:21.520 --> 30:22.680
I just want them to meet him.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.080
Oh, who's at Harvard?

30:24.160 --> 30:26.276
Like, um, like, uh, like, like...

30:26.760 --> 30:28.193
Yeah, yeah, like, um...

30:28.480 --> 30:29.515
- Like...
- Like a dean.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.629
Babe, Harvard is Troy's first choice.
Did you know that?

30:32.720 --> 30:34.880
- Yeah, yeah.
- And his counselor thinks he can get in.

30:35.160 --> 30:35.831
Did you know that?

30:35.920 --> 30:37.320
- Yeah.
- Who do we know at Harvard?

30:37.840 --> 30:39.796
Uh, I don't know. I mean, I got to think.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.916
Like, um... Toni Morrison.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.070
Toni Morrison?

30:44.160 --> 30:45.160
You know Toni Morrison?

30:46.040 --> 30:48.270
- No.
- No, no, she teaches at Princeton.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.760
Melanie, what the fuck
are you talking about, Toni Morrison?

30:50.920 --> 30:52.600
I don't know. Who would I know at Harvard?

30:52.640 --> 30:54.600
- Um...
- Uh, just, you know people in government.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.560
Someone must have gone to Harvard.
I mean, think.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.576
- It's Troy's future.
- Okay.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.749
Um... Oh!

31:00.160 --> 31:02.958
Craig Fisher teaches
a class there. Doesn't he?

31:03.600 --> 31:04.715
Uh, what? No.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.076
Does he?

31:06.160 --> 31:08.435
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I read that somewhere.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.511
He's, uh, a visiting lecturer
or something.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.749
He drives up from DC.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.718
Uh, no. He lives in New York now.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.000
Okay, well, he drives up
from New York, then.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.030
I mean, I'm pretty sure he lectures there,
teaches a class, something.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.754
Oh, fuck.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.520
What?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.950
No, I think you're right,
now that you mention it.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.720
Shit.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.360
What's wrong?

31:30.120 --> 31:31.712
I just... I don't want to call him.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.400
Why not?

31:36.480 --> 31:37.480
Damn it.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.069
What's the big deal?

31:39.160 --> 31:41.469
All right, all right.
I'll call you later, okay?

31:41.560 --> 31:42.754
Okay. Can I talk to Troy?

31:59.560 --> 32:01.280
Working up the courage
to call Craig,

32:01.760 --> 32:04.035
I remembered the first time
I'd seen him on TV.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.256
I'd like to welcome
Craig Fisher to the conversation.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.350
He is a former White House press secretary

32:14.440 --> 32:16.237
who now works at the Heller Institute.

32:16.680 --> 32:19.319
He's also the bestselling
author of Political Animals.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.514
Craig, who's responsible
for this congressional...

32:22.600 --> 32:24.640
It was like a ghost
I'd conjured to haunt me.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.120
...castrates the forefathers.

32:27.440 --> 32:30.352
Um, but we have a system,
for better or for worse,

32:30.440 --> 32:32.510
in this country of checks and balances,

32:32.600 --> 32:34.556
to make sure
that there is no one demagogue...

32:34.680 --> 32:36.360
It wasn't just a fleeting jealousy.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.555
It was real pain.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.469
Why is it so painful?

32:49.760 --> 32:50.760
What was wrong with me?

32:59.560 --> 33:01.160
I thought about the last time I saw him.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.416
...exciting about this
is it's an opportunity...

33:03.440 --> 33:05.176
We'd both been in New York
for different reasons

33:05.200 --> 33:06.235
and decided to meet up.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.514
I'd just started my nonprofit
and was full of enthusiasm.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.999
...and so what we would do

33:11.080 --> 33:13.320
is kind of be a clearing house
for that, and kind of a...

33:13.400 --> 33:14.879
like a matchmaking service,

33:14.960 --> 33:18.157
social media matchmaking organization
that would find the organizations

33:18.240 --> 33:20.416
that need the money, find the people
who want to give money,

33:20.440 --> 33:21.759
bring them together and...

33:21.840 --> 33:23.976
I was hoping Craig might want
to get involved in some way,

33:24.000 --> 33:25.353
offer up his famous friends.

33:25.960 --> 33:26.960
Even donate money.

33:28.760 --> 33:29.840
But he never took the bait.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.831
Back in Sacramento,
I decided to be more direct.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.200
I sent him an e-mail asking him
to come onto my board of directors.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.800
I wrote about the worthiness of the cause
and my deep respect for Craig

33:41.840 --> 33:43.751
and how much it would mean
to me personally.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.576
Mrs. Cohen said we have to bring
all the science stuff to school by Friday.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.318
Oh.
So, we got to figure that out.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.536
But I never heard back.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.232
Well, I do like whales a lot,

33:55.320 --> 33:57.117
so, we could study the anatomy...

33:57.200 --> 33:59.714
You know, they say politics
is show business for ugly people.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.794
Any whiff of show business,
I think people really respond...

34:05.360 --> 34:07.555
In fact, I never heard
from Craig again.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.040
Aw, fuck it.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.456
Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

34:40.800 --> 34:41.800
Brad?

34:42.040 --> 34:43.598
Hey! Yo, Billy.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.960
How you doing, man? What's up? How's life?

34:46.520 --> 34:48.237
Oh, life is good, man.

34:48.679 --> 34:49.908
It's fucking excellent.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.908
You're, like, retired. Amazing.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.440
I know.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.037
You're, like, uh, living the dream.

34:58.880 --> 34:59.880
Yeah, pretty much.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.353
Although I'm not really retired.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.749
I put some money
into this little beach bar here,

35:03.840 --> 35:05.512
and it just blew up.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.670
And now we're franchising across Hawaii,
we're coming to the mainland.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.120
So, that's keeping me pretty busy.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.752
Wow, that sounds great.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.588
And I've got these two...

35:16.520 --> 35:18.909
beautiful wahine who live with me,

35:19.520 --> 35:22.273
and they're fucking gorgeous
and they're fucking cool.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.837
And they make these amazing necklaces
out of shells and shit,

35:26.600 --> 35:27.960
and I'm helping them open a store.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.640
We surf,

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
then we fuck...

35:32.720 --> 35:33.720
then we surf.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
It's awesome.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.318
No, come... wait, so you're serious?

35:39.400 --> 35:41.800
You're living... you have two girlfriends
that you live with?

35:42.080 --> 35:43.680
Yeah, well, it's pretty fluid, you know.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.550
Anyway, what's up with you?

35:46.640 --> 35:49.473
Uh... uh, I'm, uh, I'm great.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.711
I'm here in Boston with my son, Troy,

35:53.160 --> 35:54.388
and we're visiting colleges.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.035
- Yeah?
- Yeah. He's, uh...

35:56.840 --> 35:58.000
probably gonna go to Harvard.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.032
Yeah? Sweet.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.591
Yeah, he's, uh, he's a pretty smart kid.

36:02.960 --> 36:03.960
He's the real deal.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.834
- Oh, awesome.
- Uh... anyway, hey,

36:07.480 --> 36:09.596
do you happen to have Craig's number?

36:09.760 --> 36:12.200
I wanted to ask him something,
but I think that he changed it.

36:12.760 --> 36:15.638
Oh, yeah, I'll text it to you.
I just saw him in LA at Nick's wedding.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.440
Nick got married?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
To who?

36:20.320 --> 36:22.788
To Xavier. Who is actually very cool.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.199
it was a beautiful ceremony.

36:24.920 --> 36:25.920
Uh-huh.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.840
Yeah, no, I didn't know about it.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.317
Oh. Well, it was real small.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.549
Somebody asked about you.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.160
I forget who.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.040
Mm-hmm.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.957
They were, like, asking about,

36:37.040 --> 36:39.429
you know, where you were,
or whatever happened to you,

36:39.520 --> 36:41.078
or... I don't know. Who was it?

36:41.160 --> 36:43.879
Who was it? Someone...
someone saying, "Where's Brad?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.308
I remember that guy Brad."

36:47.200 --> 36:49.953
Oh, well, I'm just, uh,
just been doing my thing.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.551
Dude, it's good to hear your voice.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.949
My dog took a shit, though,
so I got to pick it up.

36:56.960 --> 36:57.836
Okay.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.798
Well, I'll, um...
I'll talk to you soon, man.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.400
It's really good to talk to you, also.

37:02.440 --> 37:06.319
And, uh, yeah, if you could,
uh, text me that number.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.376
Yeah, yeah, I'll send it right away.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.073
Come to the islands sometime,
brother. Later.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.708
Yeah. Okay.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.080
For a moment,
I imagined Billy's life in Maui,

37:27.480 --> 37:28.708
with two young girlfriends,

37:29.480 --> 37:30.959
and the great sex he must be having.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.120
Then I thought about Melanie

37:51.160 --> 37:52.752
and what was left of our sex life.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.696
Please leave a message for...

38:18.720 --> 38:19.720
Craig Fisher.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.640
...at the beep.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.390
Uh, hey, Craig. It's, uh, Brad Sloan.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.557
How you doing, man?

38:25.640 --> 38:29.997
Uh, I'm in Boston, and, uh, my son...

38:30.120 --> 38:31.633
Um, if you, uh,

38:32.280 --> 38:34.600
if you could... if you have time,
could you give me a call?

38:35.040 --> 38:36.792
Um, it's kind of on the urgent side.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.117
So, uh... thanks, man.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.638
Not being invited to Nick's wedding
confirmed a creeping fear.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.875
Not only had I not lived up
to my own expectations,

39:01.200 --> 39:02.758
I'd failed in the eyes of others.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.319
I pictured the wedding party.

39:11.560 --> 39:12.560
Everyone there,

39:13.560 --> 39:14.879
basking in each other's glow.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.358
It wasn't friendship that bonded them,

39:18.520 --> 39:20.272
but a perceived level of success.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.311
Whether I was forgotten or excluded...

39:25.200 --> 39:26.200
made no difference.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.515
I was off the list.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.200
A nobody.

39:33.720 --> 39:34.720
A nothing.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.553
The world hated me,
and the feeling was mutual.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.480
Are you okay?
'Cause you seem a little off.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.080
Hm.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.759
No. It's just, um...

40:22.040 --> 40:23.040
stupid.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.040
What?

40:26.400 --> 40:28.960
Uh, some, uh, I don't know,
some old friends...

40:29.360 --> 40:30.918
got together and didn't invite me.
Mm.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.991
And so, you know, 'cause...

40:33.720 --> 40:36.393
I guess 'cause I'm not... um...

40:36.880 --> 40:38.576
you know, whatever.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.919
Just, it's random.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.280
What? You're kind of mumbling.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.120
No, it's... no, it's something
I wouldn't have even wanted to go to

40:45.160 --> 40:46.513
even if I was invited, so...
Oh.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.840
Just, I don't know, kind of lame.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
I'm sorry.
Mm.

40:54.920 --> 40:55.920
No.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.229
It's ridiculous.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.434
They sound like dicks.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.595
Hmm. Yeah.

41:13.520 --> 41:14.520
Hello?

41:14.960 --> 41:16.200
Hey. It's Craig Fisher.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.152
Hey! Craig.

41:18.840 --> 41:19.840
What's going on?

41:20.160 --> 41:22.435
Is everything okay? Did someone die?
What?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.116
No. No, nobody died.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.558
Well, you sounded kind of weird on your...

41:27.640 --> 41:29.915
on your message,
and you said it was urgent, so I...

41:30.000 --> 41:32.195
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

41:32.280 --> 41:35.078
No. It's just, I'm up here
at Cambridge with, uh, my son,

41:35.160 --> 41:36.320
and we're looking at Harvard,

41:36.840 --> 41:39.593
and he had an interview,
or was supposed to,

41:39.680 --> 41:41.796
at the admissions office, and someone...

41:42.520 --> 41:44.556
messed up over there, so, um...

41:45.520 --> 41:46.191
Uh, you know what?

41:46.280 --> 41:47.960
Uh, hang on a second. I'm in a restaurant.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.636
Hey. Yeah.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.233
So, anyway, I heard that you, uh,

41:54.320 --> 41:55.736
teach a class there.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.472
You know what, actually, I...
I'm flying up there tomorrow.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.240
You guys still gonna be around?

42:08.960 --> 42:11.110
Yeah. We're here, uh...
we're here tomorrow.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.920
We're here till Thursday.
We leave Thursday.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.680
Why don't we get some dinner.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.360
That would be great.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.554
Yeah. Oh, and, um... one last thing.

42:20.040 --> 42:23.828
Troy is a musician.
I mean, like, a true prodigy.

42:24.360 --> 42:25.960
And, uh, there's this music professor...

42:26.040 --> 42:28.200
And I'm not just saying that
'cause he's my kid, but...

42:29.720 --> 42:31.517
Hey, Troy. Troy.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.016
What's the name of the professor?

42:33.040 --> 42:34.712
What?
What's the name of... Hang on.

42:38.840 --> 42:40.720
What's the name
of the music professor you like?

42:41.040 --> 42:42.996
Um, Jerome Backaly.

42:43.880 --> 42:44.880
Jerome Backaly.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.713
- Jerome Backaly.
- Yeah.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.600
Sure, I'll give him a call.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.656
That would be terrific, Craig.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.557
That... man, I owe you.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.480
No problem. So, dinner tomorrow.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.800
Yeah, that'll be great.
I'll pick a place.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.229
Have a great taping.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.399
Thanks, man. Bye.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.320
What's going on?

43:04.240 --> 43:05.240
Dad...

43:07.160 --> 43:08.160
I'm on it, okay?

43:09.600 --> 43:10.600
I'm on it.

43:38.040 --> 43:39.040
Mm-hmm.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.911
- Hey, Craig.
- Hey.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.800
Guess what. I'm in a bookstore,
and I'm looking at your book right now.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.760
Great. So, I've got some good news.

43:48.840 --> 43:51.274
Just got off the phone
with the dean of admissions.

43:52.640 --> 43:53.640
Seriously?

43:53.960 --> 43:54.960
You're in luck.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.280
Guess who you have
a meeting with tomorrow.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.474
Who?
Jerome Backaly.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.436
What?
Yeah.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.320
And then after that, you have an interview
with the dean of admissions.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.120
No way.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.160
Way.

44:14.120 --> 44:15.473
Are you serious?
Totally serious.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.274
Wow! Wha...

44:20.360 --> 44:21.952
Oh, jee...

44:22.800 --> 44:24.233
What?
Yeah, man.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.034
Oh, sh...

44:26.240 --> 44:27.434
Now I'm nervous.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
No. Come on.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
Oh...

44:31.320 --> 44:33.436
Uh... wait, no, shit.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.400
Uh, tomorrow I'm supposed
to have Tufts, though.

44:35.680 --> 44:36.680
Fuck Tufts.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.112
Yeah. Yeah.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.480
Ah... we'll go in the afternoon.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.678
Dad.
Yeah?

44:43.600 --> 44:44.874
You're the fucking king, man.

44:45.960 --> 44:46.960
Gotcha, pal.

44:50.520 --> 44:51.520
What do you think, Troy?

44:54.560 --> 44:56.357
I'm going to Harvard.

44:57.200 --> 44:58.960
Coming through for Troy
made me giddy.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.040
Try it.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.834
Maybe this was the first
in a long series of victories.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.070
Oh, my God.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.993
I pictured Troy as an adult,
happy and wealthy.

45:13.720 --> 45:14.470
Even famous.

45:14.560 --> 45:15.560
I'm getting all of them.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.360
Here you go.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.880
That's our son.
For you. It's our son.

45:21.800 --> 45:22.800
It's our son.

45:23.680 --> 45:24.908
I love you both so much.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.556
And all my success is because of you.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.673
Aw.
Oh.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.478
Thank you. Thanks, buddy.
And guess what.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.080
What?

45:33.800 --> 45:34.800
I bought an island!

45:35.000 --> 45:35.637
What?

45:35.720 --> 45:37.711
Yeah!

45:37.800 --> 45:40.598
I pictured his triumphs eclipsing
those of my contemporaries.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.918
And how gratifying that would be.

46:00.440 --> 46:01.873
Suddenly, my thoughts darkened.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.235
These victories...

46:05.280 --> 46:07.032
how desperate to claim them as mine.

46:09.440 --> 46:10.440
They would be his.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.319
Um... my dad,
like, whenever he sees

46:14.400 --> 46:16.630
a photo of me on the Internet
or in a magazine,

46:17.440 --> 46:19.476
for some reason he thinks it's,
like, my obituary.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.189
And that I've, like, died.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.475
It sounds like your dad
might be a little bit crazy.

46:24.560 --> 46:27.393
Crazy? Uh, yeah, a little.
I would say, um...

46:27.480 --> 46:29.789
- Like, maybe this?
- Maybe, yeah.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.696
- A little bit more.
- Maybe a little more than that.

46:31.720 --> 46:34.359
- Maybe a little bit more than a little.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.031
What if Troy lorded
his success over me,

46:37.800 --> 46:38.949
or hoarded it away?

46:39.480 --> 46:41.656
It sounds like your father
might be mentally ill,

46:41.680 --> 46:42.795
in need of some help.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.435
What if, in the end,

46:46.080 --> 46:48.310
Troy's wins made me feel
even more the failure?

46:53.480 --> 46:55.471
What if I became envious of my own son?

46:59.720 --> 47:01.199
The thought horrified me.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.358
Lose yourself in nature

47:04.440 --> 47:06.112
And find peace

47:08.400 --> 47:10.755
Troubles will come

47:10.840 --> 47:12.796
Troubles will release

47:13.640 --> 47:17.189
Lose yourself
In nature and find peace

47:18.640 --> 47:19.640
Then again...

47:20.360 --> 47:21.952
musicians rarely make money.

47:23.400 --> 47:24.628
Even with a Harvard education,

47:24.720 --> 47:26.631
Troy could easily end up
a struggling artist.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.389
Troubles will come

47:35.480 --> 47:37.516
Troubles will release

47:38.320 --> 47:41.392
Lose yourself in nature and find peace

47:45.240 --> 47:47.879
Chickens and children know it all...

47:48.640 --> 47:50.400
Or maybe he'll
take after Melanie...

47:51.800 --> 47:54.234
perfectly satisfied
with practically nothing.

47:56.120 --> 47:58.190
We may reach great heights

47:58.440 --> 48:00.192
But ever will we fall

48:01.480 --> 48:04.199
Chickens and children know it all

48:07.880 --> 48:11.509
Lose yourself in nature and find peace

48:13.400 --> 48:17.359
Lose yourself in nature
And find peace

48:19.120 --> 48:20.792
Hey, if you're just gonna be a musician,

48:22.240 --> 48:23.600
do you even need to go to college?

48:26.840 --> 48:27.840
What?

48:29.080 --> 48:30.080
It's a fair question.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.391
- "Just" a musician?
- Yeah.

48:34.840 --> 48:36.456
I'm just saying,
do you need a Harvard diploma

48:36.480 --> 48:37.960
if you're gonna play music in a band?

48:38.160 --> 48:39.400
Isn't that what you want to do?

48:42.760 --> 48:44.239
I don't know what I want to do, Dad.

48:44.720 --> 48:47.040
Okay, well, you better start thinking
about it, 'cause, uh,

48:47.240 --> 48:50.038
this isn't cheap, Troy,
and you're assuming a lot

48:50.120 --> 48:53.317
if you think that I can pay for all this
without taking out loans,

48:53.400 --> 48:56.676
or you taking out loans,
or trying to get scholarships

48:56.760 --> 48:58.273
or financial aid.

48:58.720 --> 48:59.840
What the fuck just happened?

49:00.920 --> 49:03.681
I'm thinking out loud, okay?
I don't expect you to pay for everything.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.096
I mean, are you not gonna
be able to pay for everything?

49:10.120 --> 49:12.160
We'll see. I don't want
you to worry about this yet.

49:12.960 --> 49:13.960
Clearly.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.960
Hey, it might not be a big issue.
Maybe one of your grandparents will die.

49:27.800 --> 49:28.869
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.791
How you doing?
Good. How are you?

49:33.480 --> 49:34.515
This is my dad, Brad.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.477
Hey, Dad-Brad. I'm Ananya.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.236
Hey. So, you guys were friends
at Country Day?

49:41.120 --> 49:42.439
We were in orchestra together.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.680
- Yeah, Ananya's a really amazing musician.
- Really?

49:44.880 --> 49:46.791
Uh-huh.
And now you go to Harvard.

49:47.160 --> 49:48.718
Yeah. I'm a junior.
That's... Wow.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.870
Are you liking it?
Yeah, it's great.

49:51.080 --> 49:54.550
I mean, it gets really cold,
but I love my classes.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.868
Really great people.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.030
Yeah, no complaints.

49:58.400 --> 50:01.073
Uh, I made a reservation
at a restaurant around the corner.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.115
So, should we go?

50:02.160 --> 50:03.434
Yeah.
Cool.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.600
Let's do it.
Mm.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.438
It's good to see faces from home.

50:12.360 --> 50:14.555
It's so cool you got that
meeting with Jerome Backaly.

50:14.960 --> 50:15.960
How'd you manage that?

50:16.000 --> 50:17.656
Oh, my dad's friends
with a professor here.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.476
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

50:18.600 --> 50:19.600
Yeah.
Who?

50:20.360 --> 50:21.360
His name's Craig Fisher.

50:23.640 --> 50:24.640
Oh... What?

50:25.520 --> 50:26.520
What?

50:26.560 --> 50:27.560
You made a face.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.509
I did?
Yeah, you definitely made a face.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.240
It's okay, you can say whatever you want.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.480
We're not close or anything.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.000
We were friends a long time ago.

50:35.880 --> 50:37.996
Well, I took his class last year,

50:38.080 --> 50:40.230
and... he's kind of the worst.

50:41.480 --> 50:43.596
Should I not have said that?

50:43.680 --> 50:45.830
No, say it. What?
He's just...

50:46.360 --> 50:48.669
he's condescending, and...

50:49.560 --> 50:50.959
I don't know, he's pretty sexist.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.796
He's got this air of someone who thinks

50:53.880 --> 50:56.713
that they know everything
just because he's on TV

50:56.800 --> 50:58.791
and has got contacts at the White House.

50:59.760 --> 51:00.880
But, how do you really feel?

51:01.520 --> 51:02.856
Honestly, by the end of his class,

51:02.880 --> 51:04.438
I wanted to quit my major, so...
Mm.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.553
Uh, aren't you a music major?

51:07.360 --> 51:08.360
No, government.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.471
My, uh, dad majored in government.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.875
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, communications and government.

51:12.960 --> 51:13.960
This was at Tufts.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.759
So, what do you do now?

51:16.240 --> 51:18.356
I have a nonprofit I started
a few years ago.

51:18.760 --> 51:19.988
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.833
We, uh, help other nonprofits
use social media

51:22.920 --> 51:24.480
to get the word out about what they do.

51:24.920 --> 51:26.273
You know, find donors, members.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.078
So, is it, like, crowdsourcing or...

51:28.240 --> 51:29.832
Um, a little bit of that.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.120
Basically, we're a consultant.

51:31.760 --> 51:33.280
Sounds boring, but...
Cool. No, no, no.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.400
It doesn't sound boring.

51:34.480 --> 51:35.480
It sounds amazing.

51:35.600 --> 51:36.749
Oh. Well, thanks.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.996
Yeah. Um, actually, I'm...

51:39.080 --> 51:41.594
I'm writing my thesis on NGOs.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.520
Maybe I could talk to you at some point?

51:43.880 --> 51:45.871
Of course. Whatever you need.
Cool.

51:46.920 --> 51:47.920
Thank you.

51:48.480 --> 51:49.993
So, tell us about your thesis.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.360
Really?
Yeah.

51:51.600 --> 51:52.715
You want to know?
Yeah.

51:52.960 --> 51:55.918
Okay, well, um, uh,
it's not fully formed yet,

51:56.200 --> 51:59.875
uh, but I want to write about the history
of white missionary women.

52:00.120 --> 52:01.439
Like, you know, the wives

52:01.720 --> 52:03.790
who went to lndia
and Sri Lanka to, you know,

52:03.880 --> 52:06.155
like, "convert the heathens," but, really,

52:06.240 --> 52:08.037
they laid down a lot of groundwork

52:08.120 --> 52:09.712
for social reform...

52:10.200 --> 52:11.200
I remember this.

52:13.800 --> 52:14.800
This feeling.

52:17.360 --> 52:19.874
This girl, with all her idealism,

52:21.560 --> 52:22.629
her sense of purpose,

52:24.480 --> 52:25.480
her hope.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.637
...as it relates
to women's rights,

52:28.720 --> 52:32.190
and how one of the sad legacies
of colonialism

52:32.280 --> 52:34.555
is that they really had no part...

52:34.640 --> 52:35.880
I remember these nights.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.469
These conversations.

52:39.600 --> 52:41.158
The plans to change the world.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.309
A longing to connect.

52:45.800 --> 52:50.191
One time, I told him that my dream job
was to work at Amnesty I nternational,

52:50.320 --> 52:52.595
- and he was, like, devastated.
- Mm.

52:52.840 --> 52:53.896
Mm.
So you're lucky...

52:53.920 --> 52:55.400
you're lucky that your dad's so cool.

52:55.480 --> 52:56.071
- Yeah.
- Oh.

52:56.160 --> 52:57.513
Hey!
Hey!

52:57.840 --> 52:59.480
This is my friend, Maya.
Hey, how are you?

52:59.520 --> 53:00.953
Hey. I told her to stop by.

53:01.080 --> 53:02.416
- I hope that's okay.
- Thank you.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.510
So, uh, you go to Harvard, too?
Yes, I do.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.656
Yeah, uh, Maya's in orchestra with me.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.079
- She plays the violin.
- Oh.

53:08.160 --> 53:09.640
And, uh, what instrument do you play?

53:10.040 --> 53:11.837
I play the flute. Yeah.

53:12.840 --> 53:14.398
- The flute? Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.936
I just don't feel like it's my job

53:16.960 --> 53:19.315
to be the ambassador
to all these Chinese students.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.040
I mean, of course I want
to help them assimilate, but...

53:22.360 --> 53:25.557
First of all, I'm fucking Korean. Okay?

53:26.080 --> 53:28.116
And second of all,
I don't even speak Mandarin...

53:28.200 --> 53:30.111
Her friend Maya
was equally captivating,

53:30.720 --> 53:31.914
equally compelling.

53:35.480 --> 53:36.879
I suddenly felt a deep grief...

53:39.400 --> 53:40.960
for all the women I would never love...

53:43.520 --> 53:45.192
and all the lives I would never live.

53:55.440 --> 53:57.032
I imagined running away with them both

53:57.120 --> 53:58.680
and starting again.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.600
And what that might look like.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.788
Really great, right?

54:20.880 --> 54:22.632
Yes. It was pretty funny.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.556
You were there, you...
I know.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.716
Thank you guys so much for dinner.

54:30.840 --> 54:32.736
Yes, thank you.
Yeah. Well, thanks for taking the time.

54:32.760 --> 54:34.159
I know Troy appreciates it.

54:34.240 --> 54:36.754
Yeah, Troy's very grateful. Thank you.

54:37.600 --> 54:38.816
Uh, well, we're meeting a few people

54:38.840 --> 54:40.800
at The Druid for drinks,
if you guys want to come.

54:41.400 --> 54:42.628
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

54:43.280 --> 54:44.360
Uh, just across the street.

54:44.880 --> 54:46.154
Oh. You, um...

54:46.920 --> 54:48.896
Yeah, you know what,
Troy's got a bunch of meetings tomorrow,

54:48.920 --> 54:50.797
so, we should probably get some sleep.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.155
Not even for one drink?

54:52.280 --> 54:53.190
Nah.
Oh, I'm not 21,

54:53.280 --> 54:54.793
so, I probably can't even get in.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.673
Oh, that's right. Shit.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.320
Yeah. But you guys have fun, all right?

54:58.800 --> 55:00.720
And we'll see you tomorrow night
for the concert.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.712
We will?
Uh, well, no, you can't,

55:02.800 --> 55:04.216
'cause you got dinner with your friend.

55:04.240 --> 55:05.719
But, uh, I'm gonna go.
Oh, right.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.119
Aw.
Craig Fisher.

55:07.920 --> 55:08.920
Oh.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.400
Have fun with that.

55:10.440 --> 55:11.873
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.951
Okay, well, uh...

55:14.360 --> 55:15.270
- Okay, bye.
- Bye, hon.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.656
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye. Cool.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.496
- Bye. Was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, great to meet you.

55:18.520 --> 55:19.350
- Thanks for dinner.
- All right.

55:19.440 --> 55:20.936
- Yeah, of course. All right.
- Bye. Thank you.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.160
- Thank you so much.
- Bye-bye.

55:22.640 --> 55:23.470
Good night.
Enjoy school.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.160
- Thank you.
- Okay.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.120
Kind of seemed like you wanted to go.

55:30.680 --> 55:31.908
Oh, no. No.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.479
I was just, uh, just being polite.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.080
Mm.

55:38.040 --> 55:39.056
Now, your book, as we heard,

55:39.080 --> 55:40.976
starts with a warning
that readers might be better off

55:41.000 --> 55:42.115
with a more cheerful book.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.670
Why did you decide
to start your book that way?

55:45.960 --> 55:47.279
Well, it seemed only fair,

55:47.880 --> 55:51.429
um, to warn anyone who was,
uh, who was seeking cheerfulness.

55:51.520 --> 55:53.750
- Troy?
- And, um, also,

55:53.840 --> 55:55.831
when I sat down to start writing...

55:57.680 --> 55:58.800
Troy, you awake?

56:22.720 --> 56:24.517
âª Something in the night is calling me âª

56:25.240 --> 56:27.310
âª Saying get up, get up âª

56:28.120 --> 56:29.792
âª Get up, get up âª

56:30.320 --> 56:33.232
âª Something in the distance is creeping âª

56:34.560 --> 56:36.073
âª Closer, closer... âª

56:36.720 --> 56:39.234
Hey. Hi. Uh, I think
I'll just, uh, close out my tab.

56:39.440 --> 56:40.960
Uh, just the whiskey?
Yeah.

56:41.240 --> 56:42.240
Eight dollars.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.360
Hey!

56:46.480 --> 56:48.072
Hey! Yeah.
You made it.

56:48.240 --> 56:51.915
Yeah. I just, uh, had a little insomnia,
so I, uh, got a whiskey.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.000
Well, we're over in the corner.
Come join us.

56:54.880 --> 56:57.348
Oh. Uh, nah. You guys
are having a good time.

56:57.440 --> 56:59.317
I... I just couldn't sleep.

56:59.760 --> 57:00.795
Oh, come on.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.918
We're not having fun,
we're organizing a protest.

57:04.280 --> 57:05.633
Yeah? That's cool.
Mm-hmm.

57:06.440 --> 57:07.480
I'm very impressed by you.

57:07.560 --> 57:10.074
Yeah?
Yeah. I think it's, uh, really cool,

57:10.160 --> 57:12.355
a person your age who's
so aware of what's going on,

57:12.440 --> 57:14.670
but you're hopeful and, uh,

57:14.760 --> 57:16.496
you seem to have your values
in the right place.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.316
Thank you.

57:17.400 --> 57:20.312
Yeah. Reminds me of when I was your age
and going to school.

57:21.560 --> 57:22.720
So, what's your advice to me?

57:25.200 --> 57:26.200
My advice?
Yeah.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.598
If you were to go back in time

57:28.680 --> 57:30.557
and give yourself advice,
what would you say?

57:31.960 --> 57:33.029
Oh.

57:33.120 --> 57:34.120
Seriously?

57:34.800 --> 57:36.518
Yeah. Honestly, I'd love to know.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.037
Honestly, I would probably say,

57:41.440 --> 57:43.954
"Forget nonprofits, Brad.
Just go make a lot of money."

57:45.560 --> 57:46.834
Shut up. You aren't serious.

57:47.280 --> 57:48.633
No, I'm totally serious.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.718
If you want to make an impact in the world

57:50.800 --> 57:53.872
and have respect, go be Bill Gates.

57:53.960 --> 57:55.075
Go make a lot of money,

57:55.200 --> 57:57.191
and then you can do
whatever you want with it.

57:58.160 --> 57:59.673
That's what you would say?
Yeah.

58:00.160 --> 58:02.071
Look, I go to a dinner party
and I tell people

58:02.160 --> 58:04.230
what I do for a living,
and for about three minutes,

58:04.320 --> 58:06.296
they act like they admire me
and they're interested,

58:06.320 --> 58:09.357
and then, uh,
after three minutes, I'm invisible.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.434
They do not admire me.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.736
And what's worse, they think
I'm gonna ask them for a donation...

58:14.760 --> 58:16.557
which I usually do.

58:16.800 --> 58:17.800
Mm-hmm.

58:18.840 --> 58:19.840
What?

58:20.200 --> 58:21.679
Do I sound jaded, or...

58:22.320 --> 58:24.311
Just know, I started out
as idealistic as you

58:24.400 --> 58:25.913
or any of your friends over there.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.496
And I'm not saying what,
you know, what you do...

58:28.520 --> 58:29.840
I could tell I'd lost her.

58:31.440 --> 58:32.440
Lost her respect.

58:34.840 --> 58:35.840
And I wanted it back.

58:37.880 --> 58:40.269
I thought if I could summarize
the trajectory of my life,

58:41.360 --> 58:42.429
she would understand me,

58:43.840 --> 58:45.560
see me as someone
who'd lost the good fight,

58:46.480 --> 58:47.680
but had fought it nonetheless.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.000
I mean, when I was in journalism school,
that's...

58:51.040 --> 58:52.234
that was the ideal, you know?

58:52.320 --> 58:53.776
Everybody wanted to be
Woodward and Bernstein.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.416
You know what I mean? You know...
Mm. Mm-hmm.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.176
You know who they are, right?
Yeah, yeah, of course.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.696
I told her
about my career mistakes,

58:58.720 --> 59:01.598
my years in journalism just as
the newspaper business was folding.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.269
My attempt to start a digital
magazine in San Francisco,

59:06.360 --> 59:08.715
but how no one wanted to read
long-form pieces anymore.

59:10.200 --> 59:13.317
And how I'd won a few prestigious prizes,
but my magazine had still gone bust.

59:13.400 --> 59:14.310
Yeah, we won a Peabody.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.550
I mean, you know,
not that that matters, but...

59:17.960 --> 59:19.552
I talked about my friends from college,

59:20.400 --> 59:23.119
and how they'd sold out and gotten rich,

59:23.840 --> 59:25.717
and didn't invite me
to their milestone events,

59:26.080 --> 59:28.160
even though I'd been
the heart and soul of our group.

59:29.520 --> 59:30.800
I may have failed in their eyes,

59:31.160 --> 59:32.640
but at least I still had my integrity

59:33.280 --> 59:34.280
and could sleep at night.

59:34.720 --> 59:36.536
And then there are guys
like Craig Fisher, who...

59:36.560 --> 59:37.913
but he has no moral compass,

59:38.000 --> 59:39.680
and he'll just basically pivot to whatever

59:40.240 --> 59:43.312
sound bite or talking point,
what makes him seem the most interesting,

59:43.400 --> 59:44.696
the most, you know, it's whatever.

59:44.720 --> 59:47.001
He's very, you know, telegenic.
I get it, you know, but...

59:48.200 --> 59:49.680
I told her about my nonprofit.

59:50.520 --> 59:51.896
Even though it had been struggling lately,

59:51.920 --> 59:53.680
I still felt I'd done
some real good with it.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.920
Maybe if I was more in touch

59:56.000 --> 59:58.056
with the people I was helping,
or out in the field more,

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.231
I would feel
a little less disconnected or, um...

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.117
Wh... what is that look?

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.720
What?

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.551
That...

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.680
No, what are you thinking?

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.040
What am I thinking?

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.595
Yeah, please, tell me.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320
Honestly...

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.273
I'm thinking you're really lucky.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.436
You're 50 years old,

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.560
and you still think
that the world was made for you.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.952
Uh, I'm 47.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.478
Do you even know poor people?

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.920
Of course.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.595
Okay, well, when I visit
my mother's family in Delhi,

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.758
a lot of people out there
only live on two dollars a day.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.756
They're not complaining
about being ignored at a dinner party.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.713
They're happy they get dinner.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.918
Right. But I'm not competing
with those people. I'm...

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.389
You compete with the people
who are markers in your life.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.673
Why are you competing at all?

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.153
It's the way the world is. And...

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.989
You competing
with your friends from college,

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.750
that competition
is the history of colonialism, okay?

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.400
And... and the oppression of women,

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.158
and the fucking up of the environment.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.560
Oh, come on, don't go there.
And...

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.240
I'm not part
of the problem, okay?

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.079
I work for a...
a nonprofit, for fuck's sake.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.638
It's just, from where I sit,
it kind of seems like

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.915
white privilege, male privilege,

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.679
first-class problems.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.799
Okay. I...

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.188
You know, I know I might seem
like some clichÃ© to you,

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.033
but this is actually my life, okay?

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.949
Just... don't ask me to feel bad for you.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.789
You're doing just fine.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.120
Trust me.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.792
I promise you; you have enough.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.136
Yeah, you, too.
I'll see you around.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.160
All right, so long. Bye.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960
Dad.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.680
Dad.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.640
- Dad, we got to go. I got my meeting.
- Mm.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.360
Mm... hungover.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.396
What?
You had one glass of wine.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.896
I couldn't stop thinking
about Ananya

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.955
and the things she said.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.639
And the contempt she had for me.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.296
Listen, if we have any luck
at all, girls...

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.440
I doubted she'd ever
live up to all her ideals.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.393
...plantains and... and daiquiris...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.149
One taste of luxury,

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.560
how quickly she'd forget
the suffering of the masses.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.830
I mean,
can't believe that I met you girls.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.000
I knew I was just trying
to make myself feel better.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.593
Ananya had a good heart.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.159
She reminded me a lot of Melanie.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040
Oh, shit.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400
Melanie.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.936
Hey, it's Melanie.
Leave me a message.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.915
Hey, hon. Uh, trip's going great.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.273
Troy's meeting with one
of the music professors here right now,

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.680
and then he's got an interview
with the dean of admissions.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.069
So, uh, yeah,
it all seems to be working out.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.120
Uh...

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.391
Oh. Actually, Troy's coming right now,
so, uh, I'll call you back later.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.711
Yeah, I got dinner
with Craig Fisher tonight,

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.031
so, I'm really looking forward
to that, as you can imagine.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.478
Uh, okay. I love you, honey. Bye.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.231
Hey.
Hey. How was it?

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.896
It was, uh, it was good.
He listened to some of my stuff.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.229
I think he liked it.
That's awesome, Troy.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.313
See? There you go.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040
Connections and talent.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.760
I give you the layup, you swish it in.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720
That's great, man.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.400
What's wrong?

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.720
Nothing.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.071
Okay. You seem a little, uh...

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.360
Should be happy.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.677
Should be pumped.
Yeah. No, I am.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.433
I don't... He just, like,
wasn't what I expected,

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.919
but, you know, he was fine.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.479
How is he not what you expected?

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.760
Um...

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.600
Uh, I don't know, it's just weird,
'cause it's, like...

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.256
He's one of my heroes, but it seemed like

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.510
he was trying kind of hard to,
like, impress me.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.473
Mm-hmm.
And he was, like, sort of

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.672
bragging a lot, and he was, like,

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.349
uh... a lot more into

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.296
the business side of things, too,
than I would have thought.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.520
Like, he kept telling me ways
I should monetize my music

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.556
and just, like,
a bunch of weird stuff like that.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.078
Um... I don't know.
I just thought that he would be cooler.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.752
You know, uh,
don't be so judgmental, Troy.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.915
Hmm?
You've been living in a bubble.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.228
Remember that, okay?

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.198
So, don't go... judging people
living in the real world

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.096
until you've actually
been out there yourself.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.475
Okay?
Okay, but you asked me a question,

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.154
and then I just said
that he wasn't what I expected.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.719
No, you said he wasn't cool.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.870
But, you know, what's cool
to a 17-year-old hipster

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.136
who doesn't pay his own bills
isn't necessarily what's cool

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.628
to the rest of the world.
Okay. Fuck. Yeah.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.151
Okay? I'm just saying
talk to me in 30 years.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.037
Then you can tell me who's cool or not.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280
Uh-huh.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.437
You know you... you are fucking nuts.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.096
I'm about to go have my interview.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.280
Do you really need to be jumping
all over me right now?

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.320
Troy...

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.240
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.840
I love you.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.438
You're the best. You're the best son.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.158
You know I feel that, right?

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.037
Dad, um...
Okay?

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.456
I know you're gonna kill it in there.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.576
Can you leave me alone?
I'm just gonna try and clear my head.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.510
I'll just meet you after.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.749
Okay.
All right.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.439
Hey, Troy.
Yeah?

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840
I'm proud of you.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.560
Want to follow me, please?

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.555
Is... is that your daughter?

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.953
Yeah.
She's got her interview now?

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.360
Oh, yeah.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520
Hope it goes well.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.555
My son's meeting with the dean, so, uh...

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.715
he's been a little on edge.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.231
Good luck.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.800
Thanks.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.880
Hello?

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.480
Hey, Brad. It's Jason Hatfield.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.472
Hey. Jason.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.040
Hang on a second.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.240
It's been a long time.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800
What's up?

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.996
Uh, my office said you called me.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.396
Oh, yeah. Right. I was actually, um,

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.589
just calling for Craig's number,
but I got it from Billy.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.037
Oh, okay. Good.
Well, uh, all right, look, I...

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.078
I heard you, uh,
guys all got together in LA.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.990
How was that?

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.559
I don't really have time to talk.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.636
It's just, it's not a good time right now.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.588
Mm-hmm. Okay. Well...

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.838
Listen, I don't mean to be rude.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.896
It's just I've got
all these clients looking for me,

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:10.989
and I'm in Minnesota.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.398
I'm at the Mayo Clinic,
and I'm waiting on some test results,

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.520
and I've got to make
a noon flight back to New York,

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.033
or I'm gonna miss this deposition

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.920
that I've been preparing for
for months, so...

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.675
Y eah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.
I got it. I hear you.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.439
W ell, at least you know
the plane will wait for you, right?

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.349
I don't understand.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.196
I mean, you have your own jet, right?
So, that must make it a little easier.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:32.279
A jet?

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.430
Are you being an asshole right now, or...

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.870
What? No. No. I'm serious. You...

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.234
I don't own a jet.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:40.880
- What are you talking about?
- I...

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.788
I thought... I swear you told me once
you had a private plane.

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:46.799
What? No.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.868
In San Francisco.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.856
When I saw you,
you said you just were on your, um...

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.031
Yeah, my company leased a plane
and flew everyone out there.

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:58.792
Um, okay, well, I misunderstood.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.232
Listen, I just found out

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.470
that my daughter
has a tethered spine, okay?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.473
She's fucking three years old.

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:07.479
What?

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.837
Oh, no. Man, I'm...

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.558
Jason, I...

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.758
What does... what does that mean?

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:17.560
I don't know what it means,

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.675
except, uh,

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:21.435
she's having major surgery in the morning,

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.350
and, uh, she's just, uh...

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:25.872
she's so little, you know?

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:29.356
Oh... my God.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.229
And it's killing me.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.120
Listen, we're sitting down
with the doctors right now.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.673
I got to go, Brad.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.120
Okay. Okay, well...
well, uh, keep me posted,

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.549
and please give my love to your family.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.990
And, uh, I'm really sorry.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.951
Aren't you gonna, like,
ask me how it went?

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.160
What?

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520
The interview?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.353
Yeah, of course. How'd it go?

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.839
It was, uh, it was really good.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.119
He said Jerome Backaly already called him
and told him that I was talented

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.316
and to pay attention to my application.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.720
Really?
Yeah.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.153
Troy, that's amazing.
Yeah.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.670
Are you happy?
Yeah.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.079
Good, man. Come on.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.800
Let's get this guy, all right?

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.280
Hey, we're going
to Tufts University.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.800
Do you mind
if I don't go on the tour?

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.630
Okay, sure.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.936
There's an old professor of mine

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.632
- I want to go say hi to.
- Okay.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.936
I think I told you about him.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.960
Yeah. That's fine.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.678
Yeah, it's right down there.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.714
My old dorm is back that way.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.113
Hi. I'm an old student
of Professor Connor's.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.600
I was hoping I could say hi to him.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.238
- Is he, uh...
- Oh.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.477
You just missed him.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.957
- He just left?
- No.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.480
Um...

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.712
I'm sorry to say he died...

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.870
just a few weeks ago, so...

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480
He died?

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.276
But his name is still on the,
uh, directory.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.830
I know. We have to change that.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.956
I just got in here, so...
Oh.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.320
How did he die?

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.634
He had a stroke, and he never recovered.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.756
- Oh. Well, that's so sad.
- Mm.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
Yes.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.675
He was a great teacher.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.476
He was a sweet man, mm-hmm.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.800
Okay, well...

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.680
have a nice day.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.878
Thanks. You, too.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Hello?

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.310
Hey, Brad. I saw you called.
Everything okay?

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.556
Yeah. Everything's great.
Yeah. It's great.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.760
Hey, Mel...

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.640
I just, um...

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.237
I just... Isn't it crazy how

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.430
we made this kid, and now he's this...

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.552
brilliant, amazing person?

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560
I wish you were here.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.352
Aw. So do I.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.032
Well, honey, we're getting ready
to go into the conference.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.439
I should probably go.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.239
Um, but I love you.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.675
I'll call you tonight.
Yeah. Okay.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.200
Okay, great. I love you, too.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.160
Yeah. Thank you so much for...

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.776
You know, I like Tufts.
It's a good school.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.109
I think I'd be happy there.
And, you know, you went there.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.440
Yeah.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.760
Yeah, thanks for bringing me here, Dad,
and going all out and everything.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.072
Aw. I didn't do anything.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.296
Well, no, I mean,
you made all those calls,

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.601
and then now you have to go
to dinner with a guy you hate.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.480
I don't hate him.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600
I like him.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.680
But you said he was a jerk
and you hated his guts.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.275
Nah, he's a good guy.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.316
He's, uh... he's an old friend.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.240
I'm actually looking forward
to seeing him.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.069
Old friends are important.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.496
All right, I'm heading out.
I wish I could go to your concert,

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.240
but, have a good time, all right?
All right.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.430
All right, man.
Have fun.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.520
I'll see you.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.875
Hi.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.270
I believe I have
a reservation for two at 7:00.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.395
The name is Sloan.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920
Okay.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.039
Great. Follow me.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.630
Yes, you are the first to arrive.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.550
Oh. Okay. Do you happen
to have another table?

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.080
Just, it's a little loud right here.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.628
We're fully booked tonight.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.120
How about that one?

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.313
I'm sorry, but it's not available.

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.598
Oh. Looks like it's available.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240
Yeah.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400
It's not.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560
Mm-hmm.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.600
Thank you.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.559
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, man!

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.838
- Look at you. You look good.
- Oh... I'm going gray.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.148
Oh. Not as bad as me.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.235
We failed in life.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160
Hmm?

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.993
Failed to stay young.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.998
Come on, grab your beer.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.120
We're moving tables.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.554
Oh. Okay.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.473
I guess this table was available.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.911
Yes. Enjoy your dinner.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.797
Thank you so much for coming tonight.
Oh.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.480
We love having you.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.953
Ah. Can I get a Jack and Coke?

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.789
Absolutely. I'll get that for you myself.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.120
Thank you.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640
You must be a regular.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.115
Never been here before.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.475
But I hear it's good.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.096
Really? She was acting
like you guys were best friends.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.838
Uh...
Oh.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.917
'Cause she recognizes you?

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.678
That must be nice.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.391
Aw, man. Dude!
Ah.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.955
How long has it been?
It must be over ten years.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:34.030
Yeah. Man, it's so good
to see you. Really.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.475
Really. Really good to see you.
It's good to see you, pal.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.752
Welcome to Boston.
Thank you.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360
Where are you staying?

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.195
We're at, uh, the Oak Tree ExecuStay.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120
Wow.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.816
Yeah.
I've never heard of anyone staying there.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.159
Uh, is it nice?

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.992
Yeah. It's, uh, it's not bad.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.228
So, listen, thank you so much

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.595
for getting Troy in to meet
with that music professor

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.511
and the dean of admissions.
That was huge.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.440
And he had really great meetings.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.754
Oh, I'm glad.
Yeah.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.960
I just can't believe
he's already looking at colleges.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.040
I know. Me, either.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.829
Well, I guess, you know,
my girls are, too.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.080
They're only 12, but they're all over it.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.120
They're writing out
their little applications.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.200
Mm-hmm, yeah, well...
They're so much more on it than we were.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.349
Yeah, I know, right?

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.471
Troy has a great attitude about it all.
Yeah.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Is he medicated?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
No.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.508
Oh. Thank you.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.600
Pleasure.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.355
So, how's Melanie?
Mm.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.040
Uh, she's great.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.028
Yeah, yeah. She's... really likes her job,

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.553
and she's always been pretty happy.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.554
Diane just, uh, sold an article to HBO.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.656
They're gonna make a series out of it.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.715
Oh. Cool.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.752
Wow. Yeah.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.555
So, uh, I went to Tufts today.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.515
Bob Connor died.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.874
I know, I know.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.750
You knew?
Yeah.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.068
Well, I spoke at his memorial.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:56.995
Oh. You did?
Yeah.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.056
We'd been in touch.
Well, he'd asked me a few times

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.833
to speak in his class
about journalism and government.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.480
Oh, he did? That's... that's flattering.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.790
Yeah, I usually try and get out
of that stuff, but,

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.154
you know, for him...

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.989
Such a good person.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.557
Yeah. Yeah, he was the, uh,

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.832
closest thing I ever had to a mentor.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.512
Oh, right. That... Yes.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.909
You were his favorite. Back in the day.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.874
Yeah. I wish I'd been there
at his memorial.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.760
I wish I'd known.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.656
If I had seen you at Nick's wedding,

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.656
I would have told you about it.
It happened right after.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.796
Yeah. I didn't know
about Nick's thing either.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.598
Well, you didn't miss much.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:36.070
Nick has gotten s...
I mean, I love the guy.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.672
But the more successful
he gets, the gayer he gets.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.191
He's, like, a full-on flamer now,

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.439
with hairless dudes in banana hammocks

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.536
running around his house,
humping each other.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.358
Yeah, I saw that house
in, uh, Architectural Digest.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.080
It's...
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's like the set

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.634
for a sci-fi gay porno or something.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Hmm.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.716
I, um, talked to Jason today.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.995
Oh, yeah? How's he?

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.113
Uh, he sounded stressed.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.708
His, uh... his kid's sick.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.189
I think she has
something wrong with her spine.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.600
Oh, that sucks.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.432
Uh, which one?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.869
He has, like, four.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.080
Uh, I think I might have offended him.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.230
I thought he had his own jet,
for some reason,

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.869
and I brought it up,
and maybe I sounded glib... I don't know...

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.393
but, uh, he seemed annoyed at me

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.550
that I accused him
of having his own plane.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.400
I felt bad.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.640
Well, he does have a plane.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.991
No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.870
No, his company maybe leases one for him.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.315
Yeah, that's his company.
His company, his plane.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.556
Are you sure?

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.358
Did you not read the piece in the Times?

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.396
Oh, my God, he's getting sued.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.917
He lost a lot of money
for a lot of powerful people.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.353
He's running scared.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.238
Oh, my God. That's, uh... I...

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.674
Might be why he was a little,
uh, sensitive about it.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.276
Yeah. I guess, uh... Oh. I thought, uh...
I guess I got that wrong. I don't know.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.271
No, Jason is a pillar of society.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.193
He is a... He's a family man, you know?

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.280
He's a good dude.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.200
And he's a total crook.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Really?

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.393
Yeah, he's a thief.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.336
I mean, there's a chance... albeit slight,

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.395
that he goes to jail.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.039
Really? Jesus.
Yeah.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.917
You don't get rich like that
by being an Eagle Scout.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.554
Mm.
Mm.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.710
He should do what Billy did.
He should flee.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.319
Yeah, Billy. Right.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.111
He's really living the dream, huh?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.115
Two girlfriends.
Ah.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.555
Just don't call him
after 5:00 p.m.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.548
Why not?
What do you mean? He's a drunk.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.120
He is?
Mm!

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.079
And a.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880
And a.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.056
Shut up. What are you...

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.718
Don't be naive. You knew that.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.997
I mean, when I talked to him on the phone,
he sounded okay. He was...

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.400
It was early in the morning.
He was, like, walking his dog.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.357
He'd probably been
out all night on a bender.

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.791
No, come on, in his defense,

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.235
he's got a lot of time on his hands.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.034
You pick up vices.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.037
Oh. Huh. I'm so in the dark.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.256
Well, that is what happens
to you when you drop out

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.236
and you move to Sacramento.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.392
I'm... I moved to Sacramento.
I didn't drop out.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.596
Why did you move to Sacramento?

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.638
Because Melanie got a job there.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.716
Yeah. And, uh, I can work
anywhere right now.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.992
Oh, that's right.
You have your little, uh, thing.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.479
Oh, that is...

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.240
No, that is a cool thing
that you're doing.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:33.991
Thank you.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.832
That is good stuff.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.040
I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you about that.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.348
Oh, it's all right.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.136
Just came at a moment
when I was getting bombarded, you know?

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.628
It's like every day
I'm being hit up for requests.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.071
Speaking engagements
and writing introductions

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.994
to someone's book
and being asked to sit on boards,

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.718
executive boards, not-for-profit boards.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.056
It's just not enough
hours in the day, you know?

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.992
Sometimes you got to...
you got to just draw the line.

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.949
As hard as it is.
Mm-hmm.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.355
You know? You got to learn... to say no.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:09.918
Just yesterday I was asked to speak
at the Aspen ldeas Festival in June.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.856
Well, that one I'm gonna do.
But that's cool, you know?

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.110
That's interesting people, well-curated.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.314
Hey, Craig.
Yeah.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.389
Listen, I just want you to know, uh...

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.840
I'm proud of you.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.157
I really am.
Oh.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.152
I know you must be
under so much pressure, you know,

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.516
having so many balls in the air
and everything that's going on. But...

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.016
you know, from the outside...

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.268
It's not that stressful.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.032
It's... it's fun.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.200
I'm just happy for you.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.113
Aw.
To be honest,

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.509
at first, when I'd see you on TV,

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.519
it kind of bothered me a little.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.936
Just 'cause, you know, we always had
our little competitive thing.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:55.589
But, um... you know, I'm happy in my life.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.400
You're doing what you want to do.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.319
And things work out the way they should.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.277
I was never competitive
with you.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:10.075
Well, I mean, come on.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.600
Really?

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.470
Uh, maybe in school for, like, a second.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.834
But, um...

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.080
I haven't thought
of you like that in years.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.720
You haven't thought of me that way? Wh...

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.000
What do you... what do you mean by that?

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.672
Why would I compete with you?

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.553
Aw, come on, shut the fuck up.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.592
What?
Look, I'm just...

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.398
I'm trying to be real with you, all right?

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.959
Let's... You know? I mean...

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.000
Like, do you...

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.714
do you even know what I do?

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.069
I mean, I actually help people. I...

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.476
I just don't... I don't...

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.240
Like, why would you...

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.240
treat me like this?

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.919
Treat you? Like what?

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.880
I just... I don't...
What am I to you? Am I...

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.759
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher.
Hi. Uh, my name's Mark.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.237
Hi.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.278
Um, I'm such a big fan of yours. I...

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.279
I love your work,
your books, just everything.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.256
I was wondering
if I could take a picture...

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.794
You know, my mom died,
and you never said anything.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.195
Like, you follow me on Facebook, you know?

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.838
I just... I don't know.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.440
I don't know.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.519
Sorry, am I... interrupting?

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.556
No, no, no. Go, go, go.
Oh, okay. Thank you.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.999
Great. Thank you.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.233
I... Are you my friend?

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.959
Or... Are you? Or... I don't know.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.838
I mean, what are...
Are we even... What are we?

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.959
I just, I just... All this shit-talking.
And... just...

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.037
Just, it's like, I...

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.360
Right now, I'm feeling like...

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.920
I know what I'm feeling, and it's not...

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.471
Okay, I'm genuinely confused.
What's going on?

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.997
Sorry. Thank you for helping my son.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.280
But I just... I can't...
I'm sorry, I can't...

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.993
I can't... can't do this.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.597
I don't know whatever this is. I can't...

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Sir?

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.040
Your ticket.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320
Yeah. Thank you.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.120
Excuse me.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.670
Dad?

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.760
Hi.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.320
What happened to your dinner?

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.754
I'd rather be here with you.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.456
Those are the girls
from last night.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:05.480
I know.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.313
They're so good.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.356
A sudden rush of feeling
flooded through me.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.958
I spend so much time
in my mind, puffing myself up,

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.234
tearing myself down.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.238
I sat there and just listened

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.114
and let myself really feel
the life inside me.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.428
The music was beautiful.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.508
The girls were beautiful.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.037
I could love them and never possess them,

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.718
just like I could love the world
and never possess it.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.148
I still did love the world.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.908
Dad?
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.480
I'm okay.

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.596
Want one?
No thanks.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.237
Ananya said you met up
with her last night.

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.831
Yeah. Uh, I couldn't sleep.

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.480
Just a drink.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.670
Hey, Dad, you having

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.512
some kind of nervous breakdown
or something?

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:09.960
No.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.520
No, it's just...

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.874
sometimes I, uh...

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.592
have doubts, you know?

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.720
Just...

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.552
worry that people look at me and, uh,
think of me as...

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.760
a failure.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.391
But, you know, the feeling passes.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:35.440
So...

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:36.880
Mm.

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.720
You know, when we were
walking around today

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.880
and you were embarrassing me,
I kept thinking, like,

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.696
you know, if I go to this school,
everybody here's gonna remember this

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.756
and I'm never gonna
be able to live this down.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.280
But...

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.560
you know, they're not gonna remember.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.831
Because... everybody's just
thinking about themselves.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.148
You know? Nobody cares.

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:03.320
Like, the only person
that's thinking about you, is me, so...

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.114
only person's opinion

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.880
that you should really care about is mine.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.120
Yeah.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:14.675
What's your opinion?

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:20.960
Well, I love you.

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640
Thank you.

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.640
My son.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.040
He's here.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.553
We still have years together.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.039
I try to imagine the future.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.080
I kept saying, in my head...

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:13.960
we 're still alive.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.800
I'm still alive.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:36.800
Action.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.317
Lose yourself in nature and find peace

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.517
Lose yourself in nature and find peace

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.831
Troubles will come

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.197
Troubles will release

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.276
Lose yourself in nature and find peace

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:01.720
If you love

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.470
Be happy, loyal and free

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.120
If you love

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.550
Be happy, loyal and free

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.195
You may have others

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.992
You may stay with me

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.988
Love be happy, loyal and free

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.119
Chickens and children know it all

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.513
Chickens and children know it all

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.190
We may reach great heights

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.396
But surely we may fall

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:41.198
Chickens and children know it all

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.432
God is not full of hate

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.679
God is not full of hate

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.395
Some may use him

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:58.550
Defend their fearful ways

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.238
But God is not full of hate

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.558
Lose yourself in nature and find peace

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.837
Lose yourself in nature and find peace

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:31.873
Troubles will come

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.713
And these troubles will release

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:38.432
Lose yourself in nature and find peace
