<i>Rip and Corrections

01:12.251 --> 01:15.250
<i>To Fool a Thief
a.k.a. Vino Para Robar</i>

01:57.251 --> 01:59.536
You are getting too close,
you'll trigger the alarm.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.371
What alarm?
Yours?

02:04.166 --> 02:07.836
Then the man says...
very full of himself,

02:07.837 --> 02:10.705
"I can do it
but it's not my fault".

02:16.637 --> 02:18.513
Sublime.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.934
- Natalia, what would you like to drink?
- I don't know. Wine, right?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.436
- No, not me.
- No?

02:24.519 --> 02:26.521
No, I'm driving, I'd rather not.

02:26.605 --> 02:27.981
But you can drink, of course.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.067
- Yes, maybe I'll have a little glass.
- Yes?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.027
Well, he will show up, eventually.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.909
Sorry, because when I drink wine

02:38.992 --> 02:42.412
I start talking non-stop
and I didn't let you say much.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.707
- What do you mean much?
- I didn't even let you say a word.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.543
I mean, that's why I don't drink.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.796
I drink a glass of wine
and I get bloated.

02:50.962 --> 02:55.008
Then I skip meals, I get faint,
it's an embarrassment.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.218
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.261
- My fault, my fault.
- Don't worry, don't worry.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.763
Let me help you.
Sorry.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.599
The thing is,
I'm very lonely at the museum.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.727
Who can I talk to?
I don't know, the statues.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.397
I would have to be very crazy
to talk to the statues.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.190
It could happen,
give me two days and I'll end up...

03:13.276 --> 03:15.654
How embarrassing!

03:18.907 --> 03:20.283
So many!

03:20.450 --> 03:23.578
There are many thieves
bear in mind.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.290
I had a great time, thank you
very much. You are so sweet.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.752
- I had a great time, too.
- Good.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.801
I should go.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.851
I'm inside.

04:46.661 --> 04:47.662
Chucho.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.706
Give me a sec.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.708
Can you stop chatting
with that girl?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.096
- Clear.
- I'm going.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.771
- I can't see you.
- You're not supposed to.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.649
Now.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.965
Five...

05:41.007 --> 05:42.341
Four...

05:42.425 --> 05:44.052
Three, two...

05:46.429 --> 05:47.556
One... now.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.548
What's up, Gaita?

07:03.632 --> 07:05.175
Hey, just playing Sudoku.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.236
I'm missing a number
that's neither eight nor nine.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.804
I don't understand people
that play Sudoku.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.558
My psychologist says it is good for
mental speed and to improve attention.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.587
It was invented by a Japanese man

07:15.644 --> 07:18.104
for his son that watched
cartoons all day long...

07:18.271 --> 07:19.773
- Damn it.
- What happened?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.191
The mask is missing.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.416
Hello?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.961
Yes, excuse me, I don't know
who this is

07:41.044 --> 07:43.838
but you may have found
my phone in your car.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.682
I don't know if you are
that kind taxi driver

07:45.715 --> 07:47.425
that drove me in his car,
are you?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.761
- Who is this?
- My name doesn't matter.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.513
Do I know you?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.974
I'll tell you what,
just forget that I called you.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.017
- Natalia, is it you?
- Yes! No!

07:56.101 --> 07:59.688
No, Natalia...
I don't know any Natalia.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.651
I do know a Natalia, yes,
but that's irrelevant.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.527
Look, mister, if you found
my phone and could you just

08:05.694 --> 08:08.279
take the chip out of it
and throw it out the window?

08:08.446 --> 08:11.783
Natalia, It's me, Sebastian. I think
you dropped your cell in my car.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.076
Sebastian, is it you?

08:14.035 --> 08:16.162
Sebastian, I'm so happy it's you.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.581
We had such a great time, right?
We laughed so much.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.709
I was so scared, terrified.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.728
I thought I had lost my phone
in the museum and...

08:22.752 --> 08:25.338
I don't know, maybe you've found
my badge, too?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.133
I am driving now.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

08:28.299 --> 08:31.011
No, that's impossible because
I won't be in the country tomorrow.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.347
I'm taking vacation.
Actually, they're making me take it.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.658
It has nothing to do with the mask

08:35.682 --> 08:37.808
but stress,
the physicians recommended it.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.186
- Excuse me, what mask?
- What mask?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.897
- You just mentioned a mask.
- The mask?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.899
No, I didn't say anything
about the mask,

08:44.983 --> 08:46.776
I don't know anything
about the stolen mask.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.570
What?
The mask was stolen?

08:48.737 --> 08:51.322
The mask was stolen?
I don't know. Was the mask stolen?

08:56.703 --> 08:59.080
It was me, Sebastian.
I stole the mask. I didn't...

08:59.164 --> 09:01.666
It was within my reach,
I don't know, I was tempted.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.252
I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what I did, I'm mad.

09:04.335 --> 09:07.088
Natalia, are you telling me
that you stole the mask?

09:07.172 --> 09:09.466
What mask?
The Aztec mask?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.801
The Aztec mask, yes.
I have it with me.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.638
Hold on, Natalia, don't worry.
Tell me where you are and I'll come.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.322
Stay calm, Natalia.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.578
Stay calm.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.748
What did I do?
What did I do, Sebastian?

09:42.957 --> 09:44.501
I don't know.
You tell me.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.755
I have taken care of those pieces
for years, I don't know.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.466
I have dreams.
I want stuff.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.761
Some pieces of the exhibition
were being shipped later.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.973
They were left in storage under
my care, no cameras, and I took it.

10:01.851 --> 10:06.481
But, Natalia, yesterday I saw
that piece at exhibition, right?

10:06.648 --> 10:10.777
It was a copy, a replica, a gold-plated
plaster cast sent from Mexico.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.904
I'm going to jail.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.115
I'll have to leave the country,
I don't know.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.076
I'll have to change my name,
I don't know. My hair color.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.788
I adore my hair color,
I love my hair color.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.708
Let's do this, Natalia.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.880
We have to think calmly.
You're nervous, relax.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.217
Why don't you go, wash your face
and calm down?

10:34.384 --> 10:35.969
Okay.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.974
- Go, go wash your face.
- Okay.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.140
Better?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.726
Yes.
Forgive me.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.977
No problem.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.105
Last boarding call
for passengers to Colonia, Uruguay.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.275
I can't get you involved in this.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.987
I have to be able to fix this
on my own, I don't know.

11:36.863 --> 11:40.450
I would have loved you to get
to know me better, I don't know.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.829
I am what I am and I don't want you
to think I am what I'm not.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.414
Do you understand?

11:46.497 --> 11:48.541
- No.
- Good.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.962
- Natalia.
- Yes?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.505
I have your cell phone.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.757
The insurance company
is taking inventory

13:19.841 --> 13:22.010
of which pieces are missing.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.262
This was a professional job.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.098
Even so, we hope
to find some clues

13:27.181 --> 13:31.519
or some proof that will help us
find the thief responsible for this.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.771
Do you have any theories?

13:33.855 --> 13:35.940
No more questions, please.
Excuse me.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.444
I still can't believe
how she screwed us.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.130
I mean, there's no record of this girl.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.614
She has no birth certificate,
no sweet sixteen,

13:43.698 --> 13:47.618
no Facebook, Twitter, Napster,
Instagram, blog, nothing.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.997
The signs were so obvious
that I didn't see them.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.457
Didn't even consider them.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.752
That's what Gretchen says, you know,
the German girl that I chat with

13:55.834 --> 13:57.628
- she's like a girlfriend...?
- Yes.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.882
Well, she says, "Ein blindes
Huhn findet mal ein Korn".

14:01.049 --> 14:03.134
- Now you speak German?
- No, we speak in English

14:03.301 --> 14:05.386
but she taught me that.
Do you understand?

14:05.553 --> 14:07.740
- How do you know she's German?
- Because of her IP address.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.432
- What's your job?
- I am a fumigator.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.808
- Fumigator?
- Yes.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.186
- Did you understand the phrase?
- Tell me.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.938
It means that, from time to time

14:16.022 --> 14:18.232
even a blind chicken
finds a grain of corn.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.526
- Do you understand?
- No.

14:20.610 --> 14:27.033
You have to go on to the next
grain of corn or wheat.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.662
It could be found by a chicken
that's not so blind, perhaps.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.122
- Chucho.
- What?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.999
Another obvious sign.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.168
The buyer of the mask showed up.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.961
- Really?
- In Mendoza.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.636
This is crazy.
Mendoza is another world.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.554
It has its own networks, logistics.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.441
I don't know...
how much is that mask worth?

14:50.598 --> 14:53.684
Can I count on you for this or should
I find another partner over here?

14:53.768 --> 14:55.770
Don't be afraid, Chucho.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.816
It is a huge wine cellar,
little security during the event.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.442
The safe is on the second floor

15:01.526 --> 15:03.486
and the door can be opened
with a video game card.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.904
- Specifications?
- Yes.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.799
I think it's very stupid of you
to be doing this.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.492
Well, I might soon stop
doing stupid things.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.327
Thinking of changing
professions, again?

15:11.494 --> 15:13.246
- Anything else?
- Yes.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.874
Your code name is Bond,
Juan Bond.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.472
Who bids 600?
I need 600.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.558
Gustavo, 600 US dollars to the left.

15:33.641 --> 15:37.478
I need 700, who bids 700?
Hey, we have 700 over there.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.235
Come on, this money
goes to the foundation.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.993
Two thousand! I have two thousand,
two thousand dollars.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.705
The engineer bids 2200, very good.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.096
There's a lot of wine in here,
isn't there?

16:01.377 --> 16:02.920
Excuse me,
I'm heading to the kitchen.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.090
You can't go this way.
The kitchen is over there.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.050
Yes, but I need to go this way.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.469
That way!

16:10.303 --> 16:12.180
The truth is, I would rather
not hurt you.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.348
- Now 2600 going twice...
- What did you say?

16:14.515 --> 16:16.350
And... sold for 2600.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.700
This is a bottle
that I've been saving

17:55.866 --> 17:57.201
for several generations.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.953
- Look, Madam.
- Miss.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.497
Our host told me
he was really happy

18:01.581 --> 18:04.667
- about operation "stigma".
- That was nothing.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.462
Suppose I have a figure
that you may be very interested in.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.384
We're talking about the Chateau Verdoux,
it's not any bottle.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.637
That's why I'm paying you.
See you tomorrow.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.283
No, impossible, I won't be here
tomorrow, besides, it's my birthday.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.726
I usually don't work on my birthday.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.936
I will give you a good present.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.690
I like you, I like you
and I shouldn't drink

18:27.857 --> 18:30.192
because I start drinking
and end up agreeing to anything.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.902
I have the bottle in my hotel room.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.786
Do you want to meet
in two hours in the lobby?

18:33.821 --> 18:34.989
I'm inviting you to dinner.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.949
No, no dinner,
but two hours, in the lobby.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.020
What are you doing in here?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.107
Looking for this?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.026
How did you find me?

21:59.777 --> 22:01.362
Sit down, let's talk.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.574
- Sit down and we'll talk.
- No, no.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.661
Look, let's do this.
I screwed you, you screwed me.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.747
That case is full of money,
I'll give you half and we're even.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.435
I'll give you all of it
and we're even.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.504
- How did you do it?
- Do what?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.843
- How did you do it?
- How did I do what?

22:24.009 --> 22:27.388
- Screw me.
- No, well, I'd tell you but...

22:27.471 --> 22:28.931
We'd have to go get
coffee together,

22:29.014 --> 22:30.492
then I'd tell you
how I came up with it,

22:30.516 --> 22:32.852
- what things inspire me.
- I'm in no hurry.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.728
But I am because, precisely...

22:34.812 --> 22:36.856
I have just closed
a similar deal

22:37.022 --> 22:39.900
with a person downstairs
for a bottle, an antique

22:39.984 --> 22:43.696
that costs 200,000 dollars,
and the fake bottle isn't that good.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.258
So, it won't be very long
before they realize we swindled them.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.867
We swindled them, we who?
You and me?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.494
Yes, well, because surely
when you go out that door

22:50.578 --> 22:52.978
with the case full of money,
they'll think we did it together

22:53.038 --> 22:54.372
and I won't say no.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.712
You are good.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.762
You are good.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.478
I would even hire you
to work together.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.565
But you won't
scare me with all this.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.484
Oh, I would love to,
work together.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.364
I'm taking this
as payment for the mask.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.074
Be careful on the way out.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.661
You are good.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.543
Where are we?

23:39.627 --> 23:41.462
In the trunk of a car.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.653
It isn't easy to deceive me.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.405
Deceive you?
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.449
Chateau Verdoux, 1845.

24:12.409 --> 24:16.580
The only Malbec Napoleon III
chose to be served at his table.

24:17.247 --> 24:20.334
Napoleon had lots of farms
everywhere

24:20.417 --> 24:22.670
and here, in Mendoza,
it was a secret place.

24:22.753 --> 24:28.701
In that bottle is the authentic,
original Malbec.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.637
It is an invaluable, unique bottle.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.263
This, is not.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.935
Care to explain how you did it?

24:38.018 --> 24:40.396
It's an almost a perfect forgery.

24:41.021 --> 24:44.525
Instead of four bees,
the distinctive seal

24:44.608 --> 24:47.611
of Napoleon's bottle has three,
it's missing one bee.

24:47.778 --> 24:48.988
The bottle is fake.

24:49.071 --> 24:52.574
At another point in my life, this
would have made me very nervous.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.624
This would be the moment
to explain

25:00.791 --> 25:03.687
that I have nothing to do with this,
neither with that bottle nor that woman.

25:03.711 --> 25:06.630
You have nothing to do with it
but you were in the same room.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.340
You two work together.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.883
- No.
- Yes.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.806
The certificate is authentic.
Where is my bottle?

25:15.889 --> 25:17.725
In a place
where it can't be taken.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.436
- Where?
- In the vault of the Hipotecario Bank.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.980
If you want,
I can get you other bottles.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.523
I am not interested
in any other bottle.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.735
Let's go.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.949
Wait a moment, wait a moment.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.452
- I can steal it.
- It's in a museum.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.037
So what it's in a museum?

25:38.120 --> 25:40.056
No, if I hadn't given you the badge,
how would you've done it?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.599
- You didn't give it to me.
- Well, if I hadn't let you

25:41.623 --> 25:42.809
steal it from me,
how would you've done it?

25:42.833 --> 25:44.477
There were a lot of ways
to open that door,

25:44.501 --> 25:46.336
the badge didn't do the whole job.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.440
- He won't be able to, kill him.
- What are you talking about?

25:48.464 --> 25:50.507
Wait, wait, wait, I...

25:54.470 --> 25:55.470
Basile...

25:56.096 --> 25:57.765
- What?
- The certificate.

26:06.899 --> 26:07.983
Okay.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.820
You have 72 hours
to bring me the bottle.

26:15.616 --> 26:18.368
When I'm done with this,
I'm going to knock all your teeth out.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.673
Why did you say that stuff
about the bottle?

26:31.757 --> 26:33.509
It's impossible to steal the bottle.

26:33.591 --> 26:35.487
If it's impossible, it's impossible.
I'm leaving.

26:35.511 --> 26:36.762
No, where are you going?

26:36.845 --> 26:38.472
I had a case full of money,

26:38.555 --> 26:41.350
and you show up and
screw up everything. No!

26:44.394 --> 26:46.522
See how you screw up everything?

26:47.815 --> 26:49.525
I screw up everything up?

26:49.607 --> 26:51.443
- Yes.
- I screw up everything?

26:51.527 --> 26:53.112
I have a suit covered in dirt

26:53.195 --> 26:55.589
I just got the hell beaten out of me,
and I have nothing to do with this

26:55.613 --> 26:58.700
and I screw up everything?
I just saved your life, didn't I?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.829
At least, we're even.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.831
Where are you going?

27:03.914 --> 27:06.624
Stop, you can't leave like this.
You can't leave me here.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.086
They'll find me,
then they'll find you.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.880
Stop, stop, stop...

27:13.631 --> 27:15.217
Be careful there.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.177
- Are you following me?
- No.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.637
- Don't follow me.
- I'm not following you.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.431
I'm going to my room.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.391
You have a taxi waiting for you
in front of the hotel.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.602
No, it's got a little complicated.
I need you to get me access

28:30.626 --> 28:33.021
to the vault of the Hipotecario Bank,
open an account for me.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.880
- Gold?
- Platinum.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.591
But, what for? We'd agreed
not to do any more bank frauds.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.092
It's for something else.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.220
Okay, you'll have it in a half hour.
What else?

28:41.303 --> 28:43.531
I need you to find out everything
you can about Segundo Basile.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.848
A wine collector

28:44.932 --> 28:47.851
that is obsessed
with the Chateau Verdoux, 1845.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.937
Segundo Basile?
Who is that guy?

28:50.020 --> 28:53.148
- Why don't you just come back?
- No, I don't want come back, yet.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.983
Did you get anything
on that museum girl?

28:55.150 --> 28:56.860
- You're obsessed.
- Answer me.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.446
No, I didn't find anything,
I searched, I investigated, but no.

28:59.529 --> 29:00.781
That girl has a superior mind.

29:00.948 --> 29:03.825
She must be traveling
or residing in another country.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.536
Change your search engine
or else I change partners.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.127
I'm going to tell you two things.

29:14.211 --> 29:18.131
First off, this bank
is very difficult to rob.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.925
Practically impossible.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.135
Second, if I do it,
I'm doing it alone.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.763
- You need me.
- Why?

29:24.846 --> 29:26.532
I've been studying the bank
for the last few days

29:26.556 --> 29:28.409
before making the copy
of the bottle. I can help you.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.978
- No, definitely, not.
- How're you going to do it?

29:31.144 --> 29:33.981
- I didn't say I'd do it.
- You said, "I'm doing it alone.

29:34.147 --> 29:37.025
I said, hypothetically,
if I do it, I'm doing it alone.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.028
Hypothetically,
if you do it, just as surely

29:40.112 --> 29:42.656
as it was difficult for you
to find info about me

29:42.823 --> 29:45.023
it will be difficult for you
to find info about the bank

29:45.158 --> 29:48.328
and I can access it.
So, you need me.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.790
If I do decide to do it with you,
we do it my way.

29:51.957 --> 29:52.874
Perfect.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.158
Now, I'll finish drinking my coffee
and cross the street

29:55.210 --> 29:58.297
to evaluate the feasibility.
I'll go alone.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.048
Perfect, alone.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.433
- Change of plans.
- What?

30:09.516 --> 30:11.601
This is the beginning
of your participation.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.645
Now you will subtly turn
and check out

30:13.729 --> 30:15.689
- a guy that is standing.
- I already saw him.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.692
- How's he dressed?
- All blue,

30:18.775 --> 30:21.278
brown shoes,
horrible tie, brown, too.

30:21.445 --> 30:24.364
Very good.
I think he's following me

30:24.448 --> 30:27.088
so, you'll get him off my back
so I can cross in peace to the bank.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.995
Perfect, I'll do it for you.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.042
The check.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.844
No, no, nobody touch her.
Don't get up.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.429
- Are you okay?
- Help, please!

30:47.596 --> 30:49.848
- Do you need anything?
- I'm fine.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.641
No, don't worry.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.770
Call an ambulance, please.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.397
Call an ambulance.
Don't get up.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.199
- Is all the information correct?
- Yes, sir.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.409
Would you like to access
your safe deposit now?

31:09.493 --> 31:11.745
- Please.
- Come with me, please.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.121
Thank you.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.737
How are you?

32:27.821 --> 32:29.072
Perfect.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.657
Honestly,
it was a very good stunt.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.242
It wasn't a stunt.
Everything hurts.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.244
- Do you need anything?
- No, thank you.

32:35.162 --> 32:38.999
Okay, there are three options
to steal that bottle.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.918
First option.
The Bonnie and Clyde.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.048
Classic.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.260
Second option. The Rififi".

32:58.435 --> 33:00.395
I think that's more realistic.
Sounds good.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.855
Now, let's see if it works.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.577
The vault has motion detectors

33:15.660 --> 33:17.829
so, as soon as we'd start
hammering the wall

33:17.913 --> 33:19.915
we'd have Mendoza police
after us.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.334
Did you put an alarm clock
inside a safe deposit box?

33:22.501 --> 33:25.253
- Yes.
- That's so old school.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.589
Yes, maybe.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.383
- And the third?
- No, no third.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.636
The third is under development.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.388
Okay, let's suppose
that I manage to enter the vault.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.849
The key problem still is
how to find the bottle.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.727
I could spend
the whole day looking for it.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.206
Not counting the time it'd take me
to blow the second set of bars...

33:43.230 --> 33:44.356
Mariana?

33:44.439 --> 33:45.958
...in case I'm not able
to access the code.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.234
- Mariana!
- Well, leave it to me.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.794
I'll find a way
to mark the bottle for you.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.129
- Mariana!
- Yes, sorry, I think they're...

33:50.153 --> 33:51.446
- You're mistaking her.
- Me?

33:51.613 --> 33:54.074
Such a long time,
you've gotten so big.

33:54.241 --> 33:55.968
No, I think you're mistaking
me for somebody else, miss.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.869
My name is Natalia.
No connection.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.673
How's your dad?
Does he still have a winery?

33:59.704 --> 34:01.873
No, you're mistaken. Look...
I'm Jewish, actually

34:02.040 --> 34:04.834
but it doesn't matter, I donate
because it's the same god for all.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.628
- Send my regards to your dad.
- Thank you.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.511
- Pleased to meet you, young man.
- My pleasure.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.130
Okay, thanks.
Nuns...

34:10.215 --> 34:12.634
- they're in their own world...
- They make mistakes, yes.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.594
- Mariana?
- Yes, what?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.304
- Your name is Mariana.
- No, why?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.639
Because you said "Yes, what?"

34:18.723 --> 34:21.476
Because you called me a name
that's not my name.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.353
I found it strange
the way you looked at me.

34:23.436 --> 34:24.813
Alfredo.

34:25.522 --> 34:28.108
You're looking
at me straight on, so...

34:28.190 --> 34:30.025
I have to go.
I have things to do.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.820
Let's meet in the hotel lobby?

34:31.902 --> 34:33.530
- Is it a date?
- No, I'd love to

34:33.612 --> 34:35.239
but I don't mix
business and pleasure.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.492
No, I meant
a business appointment.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.620
Yes, of course it's
an appointment, of course.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.081
Mariana...

34:48.837 --> 34:51.255
Ladies, ladies...

34:51.922 --> 34:53.800
Excuse me, I just wanted
to ask you a question

34:53.882 --> 34:55.885
because Mariana is going
through a rough time.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.722
She asked me to talk to you.
Mariana's father...

35:36.468 --> 35:37.719
Excuse me.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.816
Excuse me.

36:13.797 --> 36:14.798
Sorry, it was open.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.174
The door is always open.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.134
- Pascual.
- Sebastian.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.762
- Here.
- No, thanks.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.014
Come on, man.
Don't be a wimp.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.269
What aroma do you smell?

36:30.063 --> 36:31.856
Aroma of wine.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.400
What else?

36:34.567 --> 36:36.820
- Delicious.
- I know it's delicious, jerk.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.446
Anything else?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.283
My palate is drying up.

36:44.536 --> 36:48.039
That's the tannins. This is a young wine
with a lot of personality.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.999
Thirty pesos per bottle,
are you interested?

36:50.083 --> 36:52.127
- No, thanks.
- Come on, man. Don't be cheap.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.087
Okay, give me one.

36:54.796 --> 36:57.882
The box costs 180 pesos.
I'll bring it to you later.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.384
Fine.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.470
I have no change.
I'll give you another glass.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.390
It's fine, don't worry.
Tell me, when was that picture taken?

37:06.474 --> 37:08.184
That picture is very old.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.645
I had money at that time.

37:10.729 --> 37:14.232
If you want me to tell you
the whole story, it's 50 pesos more.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.401
This works like a tour,
understand?

37:18.528 --> 37:19.612
Thanks.

37:20.447 --> 37:23.450
This was my woman,
and this is my daughter.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.994
- So, cute, what's her name?
- That's none of your business.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.663
I asked because
I thought the tour included

37:28.747 --> 37:30.707
all kinds of questions. Sorry.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.709
No, no, please. Forgive me.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.920
The problem is it's been
a long time since I talked to anybody.

37:36.004 --> 37:39.132
I live alone. My daughter
comes and goes. Lots of work.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.968
- What does she do?
- Why do you care?

37:42.051 --> 37:44.304
I live alone here, with Mastroianni.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.682
Mastroianni,
say hi to Mr. Sebastian!

37:47.849 --> 37:49.684
Ok, ok, that's fine.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.049
Are you staying for dinner?
Are you staying for the night?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.313
I have nice, clean rooms.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.733
- I'll stay for dinner.
- Good.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.368
My daughter's here.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.556
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighborhood.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.457
I was deciding whether to stay.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.958
Your father treated me very well.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.710
You're wasting time,
don't you realize?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.837
We have two days left
and we have nothing.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.964
Do you have a problem if I stay?

38:20.048 --> 38:21.883
No, but there won't be
any rooms available.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.803
- They're all available, Mariana.
- That's why.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.596
- The wine.
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.973
Eating pasta without wine
is for wimps.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.977
Tomorrow, an old wine expert
arrives in Mendoza,

38:33.061 --> 38:36.689
a German guy, Karl Guntag, sent
to do an inventory at the bank.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.942
If he happens to find
the Verdoux in that lot...

38:39.025 --> 38:41.420
- we lose it, and never see it again.
- Do you know what he looks like?

38:41.444 --> 38:43.404
- Sure.
- When does the flight arrive?

38:43.488 --> 38:45.368
In the morning,
it's a flight from Buenos Aires.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.741
Good, we'll have him stay here.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.285
Don Pascual, how many rooms
are on this property?

38:49.369 --> 38:51.871
Four, 150 dollars per night.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.542
Do you have clean towels,
wireless internet?

38:55.708 --> 38:57.001
Dial up, but it's fast.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.754
We will cut all means
of communication anyway.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.382
- I'll take two.
- 300 dollars.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.537
Excuse me, excuse me.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.124
Excuse me, is this the flight
from Buenos Aires?

39:36.207 --> 39:37.542
Yes, it is.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.505
Do you know if any passengers
have come out yet?

39:39.544 --> 39:42.297
- No, they're coming out now.
- Great.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.050
I'm waiting for my husband, I haven't
seen him in eight and a half months.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.094
So, I'm dying to surprise him.

39:48.803 --> 39:52.432
The clinic didn't want me to leave,
but I snuck out.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.393
I want to see his face.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.022
Are you okay?

40:01.482 --> 40:02.762
Why don't you take a seat, lady?

40:02.817 --> 40:04.777
No, it's just a contraction.
It's over, it's over.

40:07.697 --> 40:08.990
Sorry.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.872
Oh, no!
I think my water just broke.

40:16.039 --> 40:18.291
Don't worry, don't worry.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.585
Get me a taxi, get me a taxi.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.045
Oh my!

40:22.128 --> 40:23.755
Wait, wait...

40:31.721 --> 40:34.390
- Welcome.
- Thanks. Karl Guntag, a pleasure.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.641
Good morning, Mr. Guntag.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.351
Mr. Guntag?

41:18.518 --> 41:20.895
This is odd,
this guy is not Karl Guntag.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.373
It's his son,
he's here as a representative.

42:46.939 --> 42:47.774
- Natalia.
- Signore.

42:47.857 --> 42:49.525
- The gentleman's luggage, please.
- Yes.

42:49.609 --> 42:50.769
- Thank you.
- Prego, signore.

43:16.177 --> 43:17.804
"The chemistry of the essences".

43:33.027 --> 43:34.695
Pascual, how are you?

43:34.779 --> 43:35.988
I'm going to introduce you

43:36.072 --> 43:38.533
to a partner of the company.
This is Karl Guntag.

43:39.992 --> 43:42.537
I'm asking you to treat him well.
Like my own father, okay?

43:42.620 --> 43:44.789
He speaks no Spanish,
do you speak English?

43:44.956 --> 43:45.957
- No.
- Okay.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.251
I leave you in good hands.
Don't scam him.

44:00.596 --> 44:03.808
Tell him we're very happy
about him visiting our bank.

44:11.899 --> 44:12.900
Excuse me.

44:14.527 --> 44:16.779
- Turban Zampone.
- Do you know him?

44:16.863 --> 44:18.823
Do I know him?
He changed my life!

44:18.990 --> 44:20.158
He changed my life!

44:20.324 --> 44:21.324
I can't believe it.

44:21.367 --> 44:23.369
He's my spiritual guide,
He's with me

44:23.452 --> 44:26.372
in this stressful environment,
of extreme decisions

44:26.539 --> 44:29.417
closed doors, material values.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.587
That's great.
Well...

44:32.670 --> 44:34.839
there are some rules
we need to go over first.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.675
Per our estimate, the job

44:37.758 --> 44:39.635
should take you,
more or less, 48 hours.

44:44.056 --> 44:47.435
The vault, like the bank,
is open 10am to 3pm.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.854
It would be great that,
during that time,

44:49.937 --> 44:52.315
you leave as little
as possible, please.

44:58.070 --> 44:59.906
If everything is in order,

44:59.989 --> 45:02.699
from here on, I will go alone
with Mr. Guntag.

45:44.825 --> 45:47.703
Well, this is basically
everything we have, all the bottles.

46:38.921 --> 46:42.091
I can't believe I've wasted
so much time on a PC.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.260
Now I am interacting
with people, do you understand?

46:44.343 --> 46:47.388
With humans!
I see faces, not photos, I see in 3D.

46:47.555 --> 46:48.889
Show me what you did.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.938
Here I was testing out the camera.

46:56.772 --> 46:59.567
Goycochea, 42, harmless.

46:59.650 --> 47:02.653
He's a bit of a pain,
but no one to worry about.

47:02.819 --> 47:06.782
This is Cantini, the bank manager.
He had a traumatic childhood, esoteric.

47:06.949 --> 47:09.785
He's a devotee of an Indian guru
called Turban Zampone.

47:09.869 --> 47:12.330
He has the security
code to the vault.

47:12.496 --> 47:13.998
You can't get in without that code.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.751
I thought, "I'll find the bottle
and take it with me,"

47:16.833 --> 47:20.588
but they watched me all day
and frisked me as if I were a terrorist.

47:20.755 --> 47:23.275
What will you do when you
find the bottle? How will you mark it?

47:23.799 --> 47:27.470
With a spray I got that...

47:29.305 --> 47:31.474
Show it to me, don't worry.

47:31.557 --> 47:33.184
Okay.
It's just a spray.

47:33.267 --> 47:34.518
Good.

47:35.394 --> 47:37.688
You're doing all this
because you like her, right?

47:37.772 --> 47:40.524
Because I like her?
The mask, I'm interested in the mask.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.109
Yes, the mask.

47:42.193 --> 47:45.738
Look, a relationship that starts with
a girl screwing you, can't end well.

47:45.905 --> 47:47.698
- I don't trust her.
- Yes, I don't either.

47:47.864 --> 47:49.944
She already screwed you once
and she can do it again.

47:51.077 --> 47:52.161
She's a bitch.

47:52.244 --> 47:54.997
Hello.
What are you talking about?

47:55.081 --> 47:57.583
- Horses.
- Excuse me.

47:59.126 --> 48:01.796
Tomorrow, Basile is hosting
a party at his house

48:01.878 --> 48:03.506
to introduce me.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.275
Everybody will be there,
the manager of the bank,

48:05.299 --> 48:07.510
and I think it's a good opportunity
to get the code.

48:07.676 --> 48:08.803
I'll get it.

48:09.637 --> 48:10.637
Good.

48:24.901 --> 48:25.901
Is he alive?

48:25.986 --> 48:26.903
He drinks twice as much as I do

48:26.987 --> 48:28.667
and can only handle
half of what he drinks.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.907
- Cold?
- Yes.

48:33.369 --> 48:34.369
Thank you.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.288
If my daughter is cold
at this time of the year

48:36.455 --> 48:39.792
my other daughters must be
beginning their resting phase.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.918
- Other daughters?
- What are you saying, Dad?

48:42.002 --> 48:43.063
He's talking about the grapes.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.005
Mariana, please don't be
such a pain

48:45.089 --> 48:48.551
when I'm talking with a man
interested in viticulture.

48:48.634 --> 48:51.387
I was never able to get her to like wine
as much as I do.

48:51.470 --> 48:56.183
But she's sensitive to the cold.
She warns me when grapes are the cold.

48:56.267 --> 48:58.060
Well, let's go inside, okay?

48:58.144 --> 48:59.770
Mariana, I beg you.

48:59.854 --> 49:02.064
A little cold is good
for the grapes

49:02.148 --> 49:04.859
but this cold is not good.

49:04.941 --> 49:07.236
Tell me, Pascual,
would you care to drink

49:07.319 --> 49:10.281
a Chateau Verdoux, 1845 vintage?

49:10.448 --> 49:15.119
"The" Chateau Verdoux,
1845 vintage.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.996
The original Malbec.

49:17.079 --> 49:20.708
It is said that in that bottle
is the spirit,

49:20.791 --> 49:23.085
the soul of our Malbec.

49:23.169 --> 49:26.630
And they say that the person
that drinks it with their beloved

49:26.714 --> 49:28.674
will be happy forever.

49:30.426 --> 49:33.804
The cold makes the strong, weak.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.056
Careful.

49:36.223 --> 49:37.892
The skin.

49:37.974 --> 49:41.270
The skin of the grape
protects the wine.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.981
The skin must be tough,
like a safe.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.942
Shall we go inside?

49:50.070 --> 49:52.406
I know a grape
is different than steel

49:52.490 --> 49:55.826
but I can try freezing
the safe with liquid nitrogen.

49:55.992 --> 49:57.453
Do you think it's possible?

49:57.536 --> 50:00.289
Technically, it is possible.
I mean, the shafts are made of steel

50:00.372 --> 50:02.625
and if you freeze them,
they become as fragile as glass

50:02.708 --> 50:05.127
and you could break them
with a sharp blow.

50:05.211 --> 50:08.672
I have to locate the shafts.
Each door is unique.

50:10.049 --> 50:12.468
- Chucho, where are you?
- In the room, sleeping.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.471
Good night.

50:27.399 --> 50:28.609
What is that?

50:29.235 --> 50:31.237
The key chain?
David, it's a statue.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.571
I know, but I mean...

50:32.738 --> 50:35.157
Why do you have it?
Is it your favorite?

50:35.241 --> 50:36.492
I like it.

50:37.284 --> 50:39.328
Have you thought about stealing it?

50:41.163 --> 50:42.414
You have?

50:42.581 --> 50:45.459
No, well, sometimes
one does mental exercises.

50:45.543 --> 50:48.671
Side effects of the job,
one devises plans.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.881
So? Do you steal it
during the day, at night?

50:51.047 --> 50:52.341
No, I'm not stealing it.

50:52.508 --> 50:54.694
I know, but in your imagination,
what would you do? Day or night?

50:54.718 --> 50:56.345
- Day.
- Day?

50:56.512 --> 50:57.512
With a helicopter.

50:59.765 --> 51:01.225
Good.

51:44.893 --> 51:47.855
He says it's so hot in there
that he's dying.

51:48.022 --> 51:50.274
Tell him that I apologize,
on my behalf, the bank's

51:50.357 --> 51:51.567
and the governor's behalf.

51:51.650 --> 51:53.235
I'll fix this problem
right away.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.290
- Hi.
- Hello.

52:48.374 --> 52:50.334
- Friomatic.
- Excuse me?

52:50.417 --> 52:53.212
Friomatic.
They called me about an emergency.

52:53.295 --> 52:54.838
- Air conditioning?
- That's right.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.299
This way, please,
I have an extreme situation.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.594
Before I do any work,

53:00.678 --> 53:03.847
I prefer to see
the state of the system.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.974
Can you fix it quickly?

53:06.058 --> 53:08.686
I'll try, 20 years
of experience on the job

53:08.769 --> 53:10.104
means something.

53:16.985 --> 53:19.863
These are very good machines.
Very good air conditioners.

53:19.947 --> 53:23.409
They don't make them anymore,
the Rolls-Royce of air-conditioning.

53:24.368 --> 53:25.619
This way.

53:26.787 --> 53:28.372
Here, here it is.

53:28.455 --> 53:29.873
- Very well.
- So...

53:29.957 --> 53:33.794
here you can work in peace.
Whatever you need, just call me.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.170
Perfect.

53:45.097 --> 53:46.432
I'm in the engine room.

53:46.515 --> 53:48.600
Perfect, get inside duct three.

53:53.147 --> 53:55.482
I'm at duct three, going in.

53:58.610 --> 53:59.903
Right or left?

54:01.739 --> 54:02.906
Right.

54:05.534 --> 54:08.120
- Left or right?
- What do you mean left or right?

54:08.203 --> 54:10.414
You were going straight,
just keep going forward.

54:10.581 --> 54:13.083
There is no forward.
There's left or right.

54:13.167 --> 54:15.002
I don't know,
did you turn around?

54:15.085 --> 54:17.838
Which way did you turn?
What did you do? Left or right?

54:18.005 --> 54:20.591
No, I followed your directions

54:20.674 --> 54:24.094
and got to this point
where there's a left or right.

54:24.178 --> 54:27.222
- Okay, right, right.
- Is it that difficult to read maps?

54:46.784 --> 54:48.869
Another fork, right or left?

54:49.578 --> 54:51.455
I don't know,
it's so difficult to read a map.

54:51.538 --> 54:53.916
I need more time,
I'll see if I can read it.

54:54.082 --> 54:56.251
Please,
it's very hot in here, Mariana.

54:56.418 --> 54:58.837
Okay, see?
You need me. Go left.

55:10.724 --> 55:11.558
I'm here.

55:11.725 --> 55:13.143
Okay.

55:29.368 --> 55:30.619
Thanks.

56:04.152 --> 56:07.447
Look, I'll tell you the truth.
It's a miracle it's so cool.

56:07.531 --> 56:10.033
The filters need to be trashed.

56:10.117 --> 56:12.494
- Do you know what Freon is?
- No.

56:12.578 --> 56:15.998
Of course not, it's leaking.
Look, listen.

56:16.164 --> 56:18.184
I'll lend you these portable
air conditioners for today.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.969
It is just a temporary solution,
and tomorrow I'll bring the full gear

56:21.044 --> 56:22.504
to fill up the gas.

56:22.671 --> 56:23.671
Perfect.

56:46.069 --> 56:49.907
Tarantini Baigunta.
I'll make a ton of money with this.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.746
Sebastian, what a coincidence.

56:55.913 --> 56:57.789
- Are you following me?
- No.

56:57.873 --> 56:59.750
I'm following the Aztec mask.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.473
But out of 23 provinces
it just so happens

57:01.501 --> 57:04.296
that I come across you
dressed like this. New job?

57:07.257 --> 57:08.424
I'm looking for this woman.

57:08.508 --> 57:10.528
She pretended to be
the Chief of Security of the museum

57:10.552 --> 57:12.596
right before the mask disappeared.

57:13.347 --> 57:16.099
I know she lives in Mendoza
but I don't have her code name.

57:16.266 --> 57:18.685
"Code name"? Who are you?
Agent 86, Mario?

57:19.728 --> 57:23.565
- What does this have to do with me?
- I don't know, you tell me.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.027
I don't know what I'm looking at.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.112
I don't have enough proof
to put her in jail

57:29.279 --> 57:30.906
but as soon as I do,
you'll go down, too.

57:30.989 --> 57:32.789
Unless you help me
with a brief interrogation.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.409
No, I've changed my life.

57:34.493 --> 57:36.253
I don't have anything to do
with that, Mario.

57:36.370 --> 57:39.039
I told you, I like this city.
I came here and started this

57:39.122 --> 57:41.124
but I think that soon
I'll buy a winery.

57:41.291 --> 57:42.668
Don't treat me like an idiot.

57:43.251 --> 57:45.879
You told me your last robbery
would be by helicopter.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.255
And that hasn't happened yet.

57:48.298 --> 57:51.635
What are you doing here?
Why are you dressed like this?

57:51.718 --> 57:55.138
Who is that woman?
Why did you bring Chucho?

57:55.305 --> 57:56.598
Wine trip.

57:56.765 --> 57:58.976
I know I owe you one

57:59.643 --> 58:01.144
but you'll go to jail again.

58:04.147 --> 58:06.400
I have nothing else
to talk about with you, Mario.

58:07.776 --> 58:09.611
What happened?
Why did you take so long?

58:11.863 --> 58:14.074
I started imagining things.
How ridiculous.

58:14.157 --> 58:16.302
You should have taken 15 minutes.
What happened to you?

58:16.326 --> 58:18.829
- Were you worried about me?
- Yes! No!

58:18.912 --> 58:21.665
About everything,
I started thinking, "What happened?".

58:27.254 --> 58:29.464
Plus, I need to be
at the hair salon in 15 minutes.

58:29.548 --> 58:32.026
I have an appointment to get
my hair done for the Basile thing.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.177
Now I won't make it.
I missed it.

58:35.303 --> 58:37.472
- Where is it?
- Here, 10 blocks away.

58:37.639 --> 58:39.158
Then you didn't miss it.
I'll drive you there.

58:39.182 --> 58:40.462
No, I'll go on my own.
I'll walk.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.020
- I'm driving you. Tell me where it is.
- I'll get off here.

58:43.186 --> 58:44.604
Tell me where it is.

58:44.771 --> 58:47.190
- Okay, right.
- To the right or straight on?

58:47.274 --> 58:50.110
To the right.
Oh, no, it's left.

58:50.277 --> 58:52.487
Okay, left, done.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.126
Damn it.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:49.479
You know who the manager is?
Do you know how to identify him?

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.816
Perfectly. In two hours,
I'll be back with the code.

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:55.193
Take care of Chucho.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.072
What?

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:00.532
What?

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.284
I don't know, you stared at me.

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:07.247
I thought maybe
you thought I looked pretty.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:08.748
Yes.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.333
Yes?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.253
- Yes, you're very pretty.
- Well, thank you.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.438
What's going on?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.064
She's on her way,
I'll go get the mask.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.508
No, you can't come, it's too
dangerous for you to come here.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.110
Don't even think about it.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:32.749
Have we met?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.337
- No, I don't think we have.
- Yes, I think we have.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:41.132
- No.
- You're an actor.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.093
No, unfortunately, no.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.178
Yes, you are.
You're so well known

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.948
that you're fed up with everybody
recognizing you.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.224
I'm not a fan, but I tell you that...

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:50.976
No, no, I'd love to

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.478
but you must be mistaking
me for someone else.

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:58.191
No, no. It's that heroic profile
of yours.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:02:59.609
Give me your hand.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.362
- It's a pleasure.
- Oh, you're so sweet.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.781
- No, no. Like this.
- Oh, I love this. Yes.

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:07.117
Yes? Oh, look.
Your birthday just passed.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.995
- Yes.
- Oh, you're very romantic.

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:13.081
But a hopeless romantic,
an extinct species.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.794
You like to dance,
and dance some more.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.800
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.385
- What did you see?
- Nothing, nothing.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:28.888
- You saw something.
- It wasn't your fault.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:34.936
You had a twin brother,
but that was predestined.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:38.773
That he'd slip,
it just happened...

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:42.068
Do you know who's
Turban Zampone?

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.903
- Do you?
- Yes, of course.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.781
I can't believe it.
He is my guru, my spiritual guide!

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:48.116
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:51.077
He was in Argentina and there were
five people that met him.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.722
You wouldn't happen
to be one of those five?

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.414
No, I wasn't.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:58.418
I met him in person
and he grabbed me, looked at me,

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.546
looked me in the eyes and said,
"You see... "

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:04.632
what others don't see".

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:08.178
- I can't believe it.
- Yes, waiter.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:13.767
It is unbelievable to find
a person like you

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.393
at a party like this
that knows of him.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:17.812
We should go some place
more private.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:21.024
This place is filled
with empty barrels.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:34.537
Go ahead.

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:38.333
You asked me for my invitation?
Here you are.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:41.961
So, how are you two?

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.547
- Who?
- You and your good fortune.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.175
How do you know?
Call me by my first name, please.

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:49.010
- Okay, were you born in March?
- Yes.

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.261
- What day?
- The seventh.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.389
- Oh, no!
- What? What is it?

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.267
It's not exactly well aligned.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:57.894
What do you mean?
I'm interested.

01:04:57.977 --> 01:04:59.497
You're not making the most
of your good fortune.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:01.606
You're not optimizing it,
so to speak.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.149
And what should I do?

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:06.444
For instance, you could think
about a number, six digits.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.780
A number you normally work with.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:12.033
It can be the end
of a phone number, a code.

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:15.245
A code would be great,
it is concrete, concise.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.080
- I got it.
- Do you?

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.082
- Yes.
- Perfect. Don't tell me.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.959
- It's a secret.
- Of course.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:25.588
Good. First two digits,
are they soft or hard?

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.966
The first is soft,
the second is hard.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:32.220
- Their sum is even or odd?
- Odd.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.722
- Multiply them by three.
- Done.

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:38.059
- Add your birthday.
- Done.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:39.852
Soft or hard?

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.231
- Soft and hard.
- Soft at the beginning...

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.608
- and hard at the end.
- Logical.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:47.401
Add 100.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:51.072
- Done.
- Bravo, that is your number.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:54.033
That's your lucky number.
What is it?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.702
234801.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.370
234801.
Again?

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:00.707
- 234801.
- Perfect, let's get back.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.836
234801.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.839
234801.

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:16.973
He woke up.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.187
He saw this baby chick.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.195
He ran trying
to catch the chicken.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:40.872
As usual, I will share with you
one of my treasures.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:45.627
Today, a very important person
is with us.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:47.462
An eminent figure.

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:49.881
A specialist in vintage wines.

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:55.637
With us, from Germany,
Mr. Karl Guntag!

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:03.770
It's his son.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.523
This is a very special wine.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:10.818
It would be an honor for us
to have you assess this wine.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.847
- This wine is unique...
- No, no.

01:07:56.364 --> 01:08:01.119
Even a blind chicken, from time to time,
finds a grain of corn.

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:23.094
- I came to get some codes.
- This is neither the time nor the place.

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:25.054
I'm working for you.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:27.682
- Is everything okay?
- Fine, fine.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:29.767
Tomorrow at four,
you'll have your bottle

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.477
and my father's debt will be paid.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.564
- Don't hurt Sebastian.
- It was your idea.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:38.401
Had we hired him,
we'd have avoided all this.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.044
I already told you that was impossible.
He doesn't work for hire.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.016
- Did they leave?
- Yes.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.559
- Did he buy it?
- Yes.

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:21.360
He's watching us, so we're good.
Now, grab the bottle.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:25.865
Give it to him. Look at it for a while
and then give it to him.

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:32.411
Take out your magnifying glass.
Don't you have one?

01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:38.544
Trust me.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.573
The German, your partner,
he ran off. I couldn't catch him.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.785
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes. Perfect.

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:12.578
Let's get some fresh air.

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.917
When air enters the bottle

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.420
alcohol releases a first layer
that, unfortunately...

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.714
- Forgive the interruption, Pascual.
- Yes.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.927
Why would a man like
Mr. Basile

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.887
want the Chateau Verdoux
so badly?

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.848
I don't know.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:35.643
You don't know the attributes of the
Chateau Verdoux or who is Basile?

01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:39.021
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:41.941
I just remembered I left some
baby squids out of the freezer

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.235
and once the cold breaks...

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.863
So, you don't know who is
your daughter's partner?

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:51.075
You're telling me, you don't know
who she works with?

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:54.453
Look, I don't know
what my daughter's up to

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:57.164
but I've been ordered to
talk to nobody.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:01.168
- Especially to me?
- I have to get the squids.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:03.713
Is it you who's interested
in the Chateau Verdoux?

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:07.091
No.
I'm not interested in anything.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:12.597
I just want to die
when my last bottle is dry.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.849
It's my daughter who
wants to save all of this.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.437
She thinks that this,
will keep me alive.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:24.400
And when she sets her mind
to something, she's capable of anything.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:28.112
Excuse me,
I'm going to get the baby squids.

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.868
There's something about you
that makes me trust you.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:35.351
So, I want to ask you
for something.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:39.206
Don't let my daughter
be at risk.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.462
She's a good girl.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:50.551
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go... get the baby squids.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.388
I'll leave the bottle with you.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:58.309
It's a bit sour
but it's one of the oldest I have.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.918
Are you okay?
Is everything alright?

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.671
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:31.509
Do you remember the code
or do you want me to write it down?

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.930
- 234801.
- Perfect.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:48.150
Yes, he's asking for a "bathroom",
he needs to go to the restroom.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:00.913
MONITORING ROOM

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.418
- No, it's not here.
- Who are you?

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:08.212
You can't be in here.
You can't be here.

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:13.968
- Who is it?
- What do I know? Write.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:15.886
A, F, first floor...

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.681
Hernandez!
Okay, let's go.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.149
What a mess
this German guy made.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.193
Well, he's a foreigner.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.049
Hello.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.703
I'll leave you to work.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.289
Good, I'll let you know
if I need anything. Thanks.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:49.748
You're welcome.

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:47.723
I'm in.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:53.812
Cameras are frozen.

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:01.070
General Alvear's queen's so hot.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.365
Come on, man.
She's really ugly.

01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:06.291
You like her because
you like General Alvear.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.077
She's very hot. You're crazy.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:13.123
Okay, I'm out.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.190
Chucho, what's this?

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.776
I am with the bottles.
Which one is it?

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:46.983
I left it aside, light it.

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:48.987
I'm lighting it
and nothing's coming up.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.340
Which one is it?
Where did you leave it?

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:51.990
Don't you see it?

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:03.419
Sir, the bank is closed.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.088
Give me the exact coordinates,
Chucho. It's not here.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.590
What coordinates? I sprayed it,
that's what we agreed on.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.467
It's there, you should see it.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:19.393
- Wait a second.
- I need to go in there, damn it!

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:20.602
Yes, yes.

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:22.187
Major...

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.565
there's a German guy.
I can't understand him.

01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:27.443
- What does he want?
- He's talking about a bottle.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:35.367
The image is frozen.

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:41.832
No, no.

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:43.417
What, what happened?

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.794
Let's go to the wine cellar.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:53.301
They're coming your way.

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:56.138
No, I have four minutes left.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.556
You had.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.608
Here it is.

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:09.484
Sebastian?

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:11.403
Sebastian?

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:14.113
Sebastian?

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:17.993
Stop, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:20.037
We said if anything went wrong,
we'd split up.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:22.664
We can't just leave him here.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.208
He knows what he's doing.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.377
Damn it!

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:52.504
Good afternoon, boys.

01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.803
Where's my bottle?

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:01.263
I don't know.

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:05.642
- Call him.
- I did and he's not answering.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:10.731
You're screwing with me.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.401
You guys are screwing with me.

01:25:18.572 --> 01:25:22.826
We did everything,
but you want to screw me.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:27.039
You want to keep the bottle.

01:25:34.504 --> 01:25:37.090
I have your little friend
and I'm going to kill her.

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:39.885
Good for you, you can kill her.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:41.970
You put on a great show for me

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:45.515
but now I make the rules.
I'm offering you a trade.

01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:46.767
What?

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:50.479
I have your bottle.
In exchange I want 500,000 dollars.

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:55.067
No bottle is worth 500,000 dollars.

01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:00.572
What did you do?
Did you open the Verdoux? No.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:04.076
No, I opened a different bottle.
But, next comes the Verdoux.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:09.498
This bottle is worth whatever one pays
for it and I'm asking for that amount.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.041
That's a lot of money.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:13.001
Tonight, at the Grape Harvest Festival.

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:15.587
Take this phone.
I'll call you there.

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.547
I want the money in a black bag

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:19.511
and no surprises,
because you know what I'll do.

01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:22.427
Bring your partner along.

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:26.306
If she isn't with you,
I'll disappear with the bottle.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:34.690
I want Pascual
out of the vineyard, now.

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:42.531
You failed to meet the deadline.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:43.990
- Speak.
- Mario,

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:45.802
what do you think about
resolving the mask case?

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:48.370
Sebastian, do you realize
what you've done?

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:51.331
- No, I don't, tell me.
- How're you going to get out of this?

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:54.418
Tonight, I'll wait for you
at the White Parade of the Queens.

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:56.628
You're not leaving Mendoza
empty-handed.

01:26:56.795 --> 01:26:58.588
- Listen to me carefully...
- No, no.

01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:00.799
You listen to me.

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:29.202
Once we have the bottle,
I want him dead.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.437
- Mariana Tarantini?
- Yes, that's me.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.772
My name is Mario Santos.

01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:58.815
I work with the Theft
and Fraud Division,

01:27:58.899 --> 01:27:59.941
Mendoza Police Department.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.778
- I want to ask you some questions.
- Yes, sure.

01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:05.614
This is not a good time
for questions, inspector.

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:09.117
I'm not an inspector.
I'm an investigator.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.578
- To whom do I owe the pleasure?
- Segundo Basile.

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:15.957
- You know exactly who I am.
- Of course, I know who you are.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:19.294
I also know you're usually armed,
Mr. Basile.

01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:21.838
Are you carrying a gun
at the moment?

01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:24.817
There's a lot of people here, it could
be dangerous. Hand it over, please.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:27.302
- I don't think that's appropriate.
- Should I ask another way?

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:34.935
I'm a public figure.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:39.981
I need to protect myself,
besides, I have a license.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:41.566
Very nice.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.798
Please, when you're packing it,
carry it with the safety on.

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:49.866
Miss, call me tomorrow,
first thing in the morning.

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:51.701
We have to talk,
it's very important.

01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:53.161
- Okay.
- Don't leave town.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.705
- No.
- Enjoy the party.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:00.752
Don't do anything stupid.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:03.380
Hello.

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:06.424
The next float was inspired by
do you know who's Bacchus?

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:07.926
Don't play with me, damn it.

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.846
Leave the money in the barrel
without a lid, is that clear?

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.681
Where's the bottle?

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:18.520
Put the money
in the barrel without a lid.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.845
Drop the bag.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.358
Now, give me the bottle.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:08.402
Forgive me.

01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:10.947
Bring it to me.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.492
Forgive me.

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:18.246
- Basile, put the gun down.
- The bottle.

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.999
I'll give you your bottle
but you let Mariana walk away.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:22.626
This is between you and me, now.

01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:29.716
I'm sorry.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.425
I'll give you the bottle

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:34.512
and the debt between you and Pascual
is settled.

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.976
No, you don't deserve this bottle.

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.316
Get out of here.
Drop the gun, Basile!

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:48.401
Don't move!
Give me the gun!

01:30:48.568 --> 01:30:50.528
The gun! Don't move!

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:54.282
He tried to rob me.
It was self-defense.

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:58.244
That bag is mine.
I want no missing bills.

01:30:58.328 --> 01:31:00.497
Santos, you have to see this.

01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:07.796
Everything in here is yours?

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:10.464
Everything in that bag is mine.

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:15.696
This piece was stolen from a museum,
a week ago, in Buenos Aires.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.181
No, that's not mine.

01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:19.348
Cuff him.

01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:27.774
Come with me.

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:34.572
Bend down.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:42.057
No, I thought that maybe
you thought I looked pretty.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.100
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:32:44.267 --> 01:32:45.935
Yes, you look very pretty.

01:32:46.102 --> 01:32:47.437
Alfredo!

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:50.315
You're looking at me
straight on, so...

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:52.566
You're good.

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:57.363
I would have loved it
if you got to know me better.

01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:59.240
I am what I am...

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:04.454
and I don't want you to think I am
what I'm not.

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:10.835
- Cold?
- Yes.

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:53.378
You fell for it.

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:54.921
Yes.

01:33:59.175 --> 01:34:00.634
Forgive me.

01:34:00.718 --> 01:34:01.928
No.

01:34:02.095 --> 01:34:04.055
Mario changed the bullets.

01:35:06.743 --> 01:35:09.120
Fumigating, I have
a fumigation company.

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:11.998
- Can you hold on a second?
- Yes, yes.

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.773
ATLANTIC OCEAN

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:52.997
Lasagna?

01:35:53.081 --> 01:35:54.415
- Yes, yes.
- Yes?

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:56.292
Here you go.

01:35:58.962 --> 01:36:03.716
Excuse me, just water for me.
I'm pregnant.

01:36:05.176 --> 01:36:07.303
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

01:36:07.387 --> 01:36:09.847
- Boy or girl?
- What?

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:13.434
- Boy or girl?
- A boy.

01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:20.942
- Welcome to Firenze.
- Thank you.

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:28.992
We just saw
some incredible computers.

01:36:43.673 --> 01:36:46.217
Bye, friends.
"Very good one".

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:53.725
Now I understand
the phrase about the chicken.

01:36:53.807 --> 01:36:57.061
Actually, I'm not the chicken,
I'm the grain of corn.

01:36:57.228 --> 01:36:59.522
Okay.
Is everything ready?

01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:01.190
Positions.

01:37:01.357 --> 01:37:03.192
- What do we do? You start?
- I'll start.

01:37:03.276 --> 01:37:04.569
- What?
- I said I'll start.

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:05.754
Can you speak up?
I can't hear you.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:06.820
I'll start.

01:37:09.532 --> 01:37:12.201
The baby?
The baby's coming!

01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:14.412
Here.
The baby's coming!

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:16.706
Stop it, Chucho, stop it.
I'm serious, I'm serious.

01:37:16.789 --> 01:37:18.458
What? Is it real?

01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:21.002
It's real. I think...
here it comes, a contraction.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:22.850
- Should I call Sebastian?
- No, no, never mind.
