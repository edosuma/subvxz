35:24.998 --> 35:26.583
I THINK IT'S FUCKING SLEAZY.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.044
EXCELLENT.

35:29.086 --> 35:30.503
WELL, YOUR STORY...

35:30.545 --> 35:31.588
YES.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.589
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW...

35:32.631 --> 35:34.049
I DO.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.051
I THOUGHT WAS UTTER BULLSHIT

35:34.091 --> 35:36.051
FROM BEGINNING TO END.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.970
I MEAN,

35:36.093 --> 35:37.970
BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.721
YOU ALWAYS WRITE EXQUISITELY,

35:39.763 --> 35:42.015
BUT...

35:42.057 --> 35:43.976
"SWANS"?

35:44.017 --> 35:45.518
THEY MATE FOR LIFE.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.979
SURE,

35:47.020 --> 35:49.355
AND THEY HAVE BRAINS

35:47.020 --> 35:49.355
THE SIZE OF PING-PONG BALLS.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.900
I MEAN,

35:49.397 --> 35:51.900
WHERE'S YOUR EDGE, JENNIFER?

35:51.942 --> 35:54.111
WHERE'S YOUR

35:51.942 --> 35:54.111
NIHILISTIC PASSION?

35:54.152 --> 35:56.237
WHERE'S THE GIRL

35:54.152 --> 35:56.237
THAT MASTURBATED IN CHURCH?

35:56.279 --> 35:57.238
SHH.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.116
I MEAN,

35:59.157 --> 36:01.118
"AND HE WOULD HAVE DIED

35:59.157 --> 36:01.118
FOR HER,

36:01.159 --> 36:03.369
AND SHE WOULD HAVE DIED

36:01.159 --> 36:03.369
FOR HIM," WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

36:03.411 --> 36:06.873
IT'S ABOUT FUCKING COMMITMENT,

36:03.411 --> 36:06.873
YOU KNOW?

36:06.915 --> 36:07.916
REALLY?

36:06.915 --> 36:07.916
YES.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.584
BECAUSE IT READS

36:07.958 --> 36:09.584
LIKE SPACKLE.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.003
NOW, I KNOW

36:09.626 --> 36:11.003
YOU'RE MARRYING THE COACH,

36:11.044 --> 36:12.796
BUT IF THIS IS MEANT

36:11.044 --> 36:12.796
AS A WEDDING PRESENT,

36:12.838 --> 36:14.339
THEN KEEP IT

36:12.838 --> 36:14.339
BETWEEN YOU AND HIM,

36:14.380 --> 36:17.509
BECAUSE YOU ARE

36:14.380 --> 36:17.509
MORE COMPLEX THAN THIS.

36:21.805 --> 36:22.764
WHAT DID YOU THINK

36:22.806 --> 36:23.765
JUST THEN?

36:23.807 --> 36:25.433
WHERE DID YOU GO?

36:25.475 --> 36:28.020
NOWHERE.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.354
YOU'RE OBFUSCATING.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.982
NOTHING.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.817
LISTEN, JENNIFER.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.277
COMMITMENT IS DREARY.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.905
IT'S NOT YOUR THING.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.825
YOU HAVE TO DIG DEEPER.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.830
TELL ME SOMETHING INTERESTING.

36:51.376 --> 36:54.295
I'VE BEEN DOING

36:51.376 --> 36:54.295
THESE REALLY TERRIBLE THINGS.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.632
WHERE THE HELL

36:57.674 --> 36:59.176
IS THE DIRECTOR'S

36:57.674 --> 36:59.176
OFFICE?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.803
THIS PLACE

36:59.217 --> 37:01.803
IS LIKE A GODDAMN LABYRINTH.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.848
ANY MOMENT, I EXPECT

37:01.845 --> 37:04.848
TO RUN INTO THE MINOTAUR.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.683
HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

37:06.725 --> 37:10.854
YES, WELL, YOU CERTAINLY LOOK

37:06.725 --> 37:10.854
LIKE A VERY CAPABLE YOUNG MAN,

37:10.896 --> 37:12.898
WHICH IS FORTUNATE,

37:10.896 --> 37:12.898
SINCE I'M RATHER AT YOUR MERCY.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.859
I NEED TO FIND BETTE PORTER

37:12.939 --> 37:15.859
OR XANDRA ROSENMAN.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.069
THEY'RE BOTH

37:15.901 --> 37:17.069
IN A MEETING.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.570
IN THERE? OH, GOOD.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.405
TAKE THEM FOR A MOMENT,

37:18.611 --> 37:20.405
WOULD YOU, PLEASE?

37:20.446 --> 37:21.447
GET THEM SOME WATER.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.033
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.951
THAT'S A BOARD OF DIRECTORS

37:23.075 --> 37:24.951
MEETING, MA'AM.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.244
GET YOUR HAND OFF ME

37:26.285 --> 37:29.206
IF YOU WANT TO GO ON

37:26.285 --> 37:29.206
LIVING AND BREATHING.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.835
PEGGY PEABODY?

37:30.832 --> 37:33.835
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37:33.877 --> 37:34.878
PEGGY?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.295
XANDRA, I GOT YOUR CALL.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.923

37:36.337 --> 37:37.923
ABOUT FRANKLIN

37:37.964 --> 37:39.925

37:42.427 --> 37:43.845
AND ANYONE ELSE

37:43.887 --> 37:46.014
WHO MAY BE INVOLVED

37:43.887 --> 37:46.014
IN THIS LITTLE CABAL,

37:46.056 --> 37:48.725
IF YOU FIRE

37:46.056 --> 37:48.725
BETTE PORTER,

37:48.767 --> 37:50.435

TO PRESIDE OVER AN EXHIBIT

37:56.566 --> 37:58.568
LIKE  PROVOCATIONS.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.737
I THOUGHT  PROVOCATIONS

37:58.610 --> 38:00.737
WAS GOING TO MOCA.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.572
WELL, IT'S NOT, FRANKLIN.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.117
IT'S GOING TO YOUR

38:02.614 --> 38:05.117
