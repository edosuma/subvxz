You don't actually believe him, do you?

39:39.008 --> 39:41.009
Actually, I do.

39:43.137 --> 39:47.265
♪ I'll die within your ♪

39:47.266 --> 39:50.852
Funny how that worked out, huh?

39:50.853 --> 39:52.437
What did you do?

39:52.438 --> 39:55.273
Everyone disappoints you eventually.

39:55.274 --> 39:57.859
I just gave her a friendly warning.

39:57.860 --> 40:00.821
Turns out, I was right.

40:00.822 --> 40:03.114
[Sighs] She's out of your way.

40:03.115 --> 40:06.118
Now maybe you can
help get her out of mine.

40:14.836 --> 40:16.962
Where's your Tall Man, Commie?

40:16.963 --> 40:18.296
[Laughter]

40:18.297 --> 40:21.466
Look at him. He's gonna cry.

40:21.467 --> 40:23.803
Hey. Hit the showers.

40:27.723 --> 40:29.892
Not you. Sit down.

40:36.190 --> 40:37.900
[Clears throat]

41:26.073 --> 41:28.241
I have a secret, too.

41:28.242 --> 41:30.076
The Tall Man...

41:30.077 --> 41:34.332
he said it's only just begun.

41:48.137 --> 41:51.265
[Sighs]

42:04.570 --> 42:06.404

42:06.405 --> 42:08.616
Oh, my God.
