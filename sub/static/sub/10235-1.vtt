00:51.000 --> 00:56.380
Until I entered high school two months ago,
I didn't know...

00:58.930 --> 01:01.720
The dampness of my uniform's hem,
soaked by someone else's umbrella...

01:01.930 --> 01:05.019
The smell of naphthalene,
clinging to someone's suit...

01:05.269 --> 01:07.440
The warm body pushed up against my back...

01:07.770 --> 01:10.400
The chill breeze of the air conditioner
against my face...

01:10.730 --> 01:17.320
- Shinjuku... Shinjuku station...
- Thank you for riding with us.

01:18.450 --> 01:23.240
When I was little the sky was closer...
So much closer.

01:24.830 --> 01:28.460
That's why I like the rain,
as with it comes the smell of the sky.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.960
And often, on rainy mornings,
instead of transferring to the subway,

01:32.210 --> 01:33.960
I exit out the station gates.

01:35.550 --> 01:40.050
June

03:34.250 --> 03:36.540
Chocolate, and... beer?

03:38.420 --> 03:41.090
But, I think I've seen her somewhere...

03:46.680 --> 03:48.930
- Here.
- Thank you.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.860
U-Um... Have we met before?

04:02.450 --> 04:03.280
N-No.

04:03.450 --> 04:05.490
I'm sorry, my mistake.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.910
It's okay.

04:26.970 --> 04:28.180
Maybe it's fitting...

04:32.180 --> 04:36.650
Narukami no sukoshi toyomite
(A faint clap of thunder)

04:37.060 --> 04:38.690
sashi kumori
(Clouded skies)

04:38.900 --> 04:40.440
ame mo furanu ka?
(Perhaps rain comes)

04:40.570 --> 04:42.480
kimi wo todomemu
(If so, will you stay here with me?)

05:00.840 --> 05:09.340
The Garden of Words

05:18.730 --> 05:23.780
This morning, the JMA has declared the start of
the rainy season in Kyushu,

05:23.900 --> 05:25.990
5 days earlier than average.

05:26.360 --> 05:33.490
Nagasaki, Saga, Kumamoto,
and Kagoshima prefectures

05:33.950 --> 05:36.910
expect strong rains over a wide area.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.210
I'm home.

05:43.340 --> 05:44.340
Welcome home.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.840
I bought croquettes.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.880
Great. Dinner will be ready soon.

05:49.220 --> 05:50.340
Thank you.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.470
Where's Ma?

05:54.560 --> 05:55.720
Ran out.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.350
Lucky us, we get all the croquettes
to ourselves.

05:59.980 --> 06:02.520
She left a letter saying not to go
looking for her.

06:02.650 --> 06:04.360
But maybe...

06:05.070 --> 06:06.070
Leave her be.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.740
I'm sure she'll be back after fighting
with her boyfriend.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.910
I've picked out a place.
I'll be leaving next month.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.240
Living alone?

06:15.660 --> 06:16.910
With my girlfriend.

06:17.410 --> 06:20.250
Don't think that's why mom ran out?

06:20.420 --> 06:21.540
You told her yesterday, right?

06:21.670 --> 06:24.380
I wish she could just let her children go,
you know?

06:24.500 --> 06:27.260
She's the one who's making the rounds
dating younger men, damn it.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.220
Oh, yeah? Well then I'm gonna go live
with my boyfriend!

06:32.850 --> 06:35.100
She's got those youthful looks, after all.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.600
That's 'cause she's never worked hard
her entire life.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.440
You're the one who's been piling on the years.

06:42.940 --> 06:43.940
All done.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.940
You do the dishes. I've aged enough.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.950
Won't you be glad to have more space?

06:58.120 --> 06:59.080
'suppose so.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.120
Help me move, 'kay?

07:01.290 --> 07:02.250
Sure.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.250
Hey, have you heard of this?

07:08.300 --> 07:10.260
What is this, a haiku?

07:10.630 --> 07:11.800
It's a tanka.

07:11.970 --> 07:13.430
As if.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.800
Ask Ma when she gets back.

07:31.320 --> 07:35.410
On sunny mornings, I transfer to the subway and
head here, like I'm supposed to.

07:35.990 --> 07:40.450
But I think to myself
"This is not what I should be doing now. "

07:51.260 --> 07:52.010
Rain...

08:11.360 --> 08:12.360
Hello.

08:13.700 --> 08:14.910
Hello.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.560
Hey...

08:50.400 --> 08:51.940
No school today?

08:52.820 --> 08:55.240
And your office... Is it closed today?

08:56.740 --> 08:58.410
I'm skipping work again...

09:01.160 --> 09:04.250
And drinking beer in the park in the morning.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.250
Drinking beer alone isn't good for
your health.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.920
You need to eat something with it.

09:11.090 --> 09:12.590
You know a lot for a high school kid.

09:12.710 --> 09:15.920
It's not me. My mom's the drinker.

09:16.260 --> 09:18.260
I've got snack food.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.510
Want some?

09:24.770 --> 09:26.730
You just thought to yourself
"This woman's a freak," didn't you?

09:26.850 --> 09:27.730
No, I...

09:27.850 --> 09:33.070
It's okay. We're human, after all.
We've all got our little quirks.

09:35.110 --> 09:36.490
Maybe...

09:36.820 --> 09:37.780
Definitely.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.750
Okay, it's about time for me to go.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.300
Heading to school now?

09:54.460 --> 09:58.470
I've decided to only skip school
on rainy mornings.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.760
Then, maybe we'll see each other again.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.600
Perhaps, when it's raining.

10:07.180 --> 10:10.810
It was the first day of Kanto's rainy season.

10:59.820 --> 11:00.990
Entrance Exam

11:01.110 --> 11:03.780
About Tuition

11:06.410 --> 11:07.700
A shoemaker?

11:08.620 --> 11:10.830
I know it seems out of touch,

11:11.040 --> 11:15.380
but I enjoy creating designs and making shoes.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.340
Of course, I'm still terrible at it.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.380
Of course...

11:22.390 --> 11:26.180
But despite it all,
I want to make it my career... if I can.

11:26.890 --> 11:29.560
I've never told anyone this before.

11:36.650 --> 11:38.780
Do you have any idea how late you are?

11:39.150 --> 11:41.280
You know why I've called you here, right?

11:45.780 --> 11:47.160
Hey...

12:02.800 --> 12:05.260
Evenings, before I went to sleep...

12:05.760 --> 12:08.010
Mornings, in the moment I woke up...

12:08.680 --> 12:10.850
I realized I was praying for rain.

12:18.110 --> 12:22.320
I realized that on sunny days,
I was in a terrible, childish place.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.400
With nothing but impatience.

12:25.700 --> 12:31.290
She exists in a world of working adults,
so very far away from me...

12:31.870 --> 12:37.250
To me she represents nothing less
than the very secrets of the world.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.920
Honestly, there are only two things
I know for sure.

12:41.960 --> 12:46.760
One: She must think of me and my
15 years as just some mere kid.

12:48.260 --> 12:56.440
And two: Making shoes is the only thing
that will lead me out of this place.

13:12.700 --> 13:16.830
Please stay behind the yellow line
for your safety.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.930
Please be careful of the closing doors.

13:55.370 --> 13:56.580
Good morning.

13:57.540 --> 13:59.210
I thought you might not come today.

13:59.710 --> 14:02.040
It's a miracle you haven't been fired yet.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.850
Wow! Is that a shoe design?

14:11.970 --> 14:13.260
Hey!

14:13.600 --> 14:14.390
I can't see?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.060
It's not something worth showing.

14:16.230 --> 14:16.890
Really?

14:17.020 --> 14:18.140
Yes, really.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.350
Come on, sit down over there.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.450
I'm going to eat breakfast.
Would you like to join me?

14:30.570 --> 14:34.370
Okay, but I've brought my own.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.240
You made it yourself?

14:36.410 --> 14:38.330
What? I cook sometimes, you know.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.540
Oh?

14:39.750 --> 14:42.040
Then let's make a trade.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.750
Wait, I'm not really that good a...

14:49.840 --> 14:52.260
...cook, you know.

14:53.550 --> 14:54.680
It's your own fault.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.770
That's a side of you I didn't expect.

15:01.940 --> 15:03.060
What?

15:03.190 --> 15:06.270
Sorry. But it's tasty in its own way.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.400
It's got... bite.

15:07.530 --> 15:08.780
Don't patronize me.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.700
Can I have another?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.290
Hurry up!

15:24.460 --> 15:25.960
Wait, bro!

15:26.090 --> 15:28.130
Takao, be careful.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.380
Happy birthday, Mom!

15:30.930 --> 15:31.800
Thank you.

15:32.430 --> 15:35.470
What could the three of you have gotten me?

16:03.290 --> 16:09.000
Hey... Do you think it's too late for me?

16:29.860 --> 16:34.030
And you know what?
I could actually taste the food.

16:34.530 --> 16:37.660
So your taste disorder has improved?

16:37.870 --> 16:40.030
I wouldn't go that far.

16:40.700 --> 16:45.500
But just a little while ago, all I could taste
was alcohol and chocolate.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.540
I think you deciding to just quit
was really for the best.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.710
Maybe so.

16:53.170 --> 16:59.890
You speak to me so gently,
like you're touching something fragile.

17:00.890 --> 17:04.730
But back then, when I found it hard
even to breathe,

17:05.060 --> 17:10.230
you didn't believe me. You only listened to
the voices around you.

17:10.859 --> 17:13.359
Then we'll start the paperwork
for you leaving after the holiday.

17:13.569 --> 17:15.359
I'll notify the higher-ups.

17:15.490 --> 17:19.450
Okay. Sorry to cause you all this trouble
even after we split up.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.410
I'm glad, really...

17:22.410 --> 17:24.079
About that old woman you met.

17:25.210 --> 17:30.250
You know, the one you keep talking about
who brings her lunch box to the park.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.710
It seems like you've really struck a chord.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.430
Yeah, get some rest.

17:45.310 --> 17:48.230
Ever since then...

17:49.440 --> 17:51.730
...I've been nothing but lies.

18:08.210 --> 18:09.250
Rain...

18:09.460 --> 18:11.880
It's raining again today in Kanto.

18:12.170 --> 18:15.880
Here at Shinjuku Station's south exit,
the commuters all have umbrellas in their hands.

18:27.890 --> 18:34.020
July

18:37.650 --> 18:39.360
Here, this is for you.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.610
For me?

18:40.990 --> 18:43.990
I've always ended up
eating your food, see...

18:44.330 --> 18:46.410
And you said you wanted it, right?

18:47.700 --> 18:49.500
This book isn't cheap...

18:49.670 --> 18:51.370
Thank you... very much.

18:51.670 --> 18:52.710
It's my pleasure.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.640
Um...

19:02.850 --> 19:06.350
I'm actually making a pair of shoes right now.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.810
Wow... A pair for yourself?

19:09.100 --> 19:13.150
I haven't decided whose shoes yet...
They're women's shoes.

19:14.150 --> 19:18.400
But, I haven't been able to
get them right, and...

20:28.390 --> 20:30.600
You know... Before I knew it,

20:31.930 --> 20:35.440
I wasn't able to walk properly anymore.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.730
Are you talking about your job?

20:39.860 --> 20:42.530
Yeah... About a lot of things.

20:46.910 --> 20:49.950
I don't know anything about her.

20:50.740 --> 20:53.620
Her job, her age...
What worries she carries...

20:54.080 --> 20:55.250
Even her name...

20:56.120 --> 21:01.300
And yet I can't help but be charmed by her.

21:18.150 --> 21:24.240
The rainy season is officially over 10 days
later than normal in the Kanto region.

21:24.740 --> 21:27.660
The current temperature in the city
is 26 degrees.

21:27.820 --> 21:33.490
Like someone just flicked a switch,
the sunny days came one after another.

21:34.500 --> 21:40.960
Oh sure, now I think to myself
"I'm glad that he's not skipping class anymore"...

21:41.500 --> 21:44.170
But in reality...

21:46.510 --> 21:48.970
...I wish the rainy season had never ended.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.360
This park sure is big.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.480
I can't believe we're in Shinjuku.

22:04.780 --> 22:05.860
Oh, pardon us.

22:06.190 --> 22:07.530
Go ahead.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.040
This is the Japanese gardens, right?

22:14.200 --> 22:15.160
Where should we go next?

22:15.370 --> 22:17.870
Isn't there a greenhouse?
Let's check it out.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.830
It's like a totally different place
on sunny days.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.010
Thanks for the help.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.720
Hey, why don't you eat dinner with us, Takao?

22:29.890 --> 22:31.550
Sorry, but I've got my part-time job today.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.010
This late?

22:33.140 --> 22:34.180
And I don't want to impose.

22:34.310 --> 22:38.480
The opposite! I'm going to be living with him
from now on, so just this once...

22:38.600 --> 22:40.190
I can hear you.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.690
Well then, see you later.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.280
He's a cute kid.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.360
Did you notice his shoes?

22:49.570 --> 22:50.570
They're handmade.

22:50.740 --> 22:51.990
What? Seriously?

22:52.410 --> 22:54.240
Just some ugly moccasins, though.

22:54.410 --> 22:56.240
He's got a bright future, doesn't he?

22:56.410 --> 22:58.540
I wonder if he'd make shoes for me?

22:58.660 --> 23:01.210
Who knows? Teenagers' interests
change on a whim...

23:01.420 --> 23:05.090
My brother moved out, and
the rainless days continued.

23:05.590 --> 23:07.760
I had no excuse to head to that place.

23:08.510 --> 23:10.470
And then, it was summer vacation.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.760
August

23:35.080 --> 23:38.370
I worked part-time almost
every day over the summer.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.410
Hmm, maybe chicken with cashew nuts?

23:40.540 --> 23:41.460
Looks good to me.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.120
- We'll order it.
- Thank you very much.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.750
I wanted to earn what I could
for tuition to a vocational school.

23:47.210 --> 23:49.960
Tools and leather cost money, too.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.470
Sure, I missed her, but...

23:56.640 --> 24:01.640
I think it's clinging to those feelings
that is keeping me a little kid.

24:08.480 --> 24:15.780
That's why I've decided to create shoes
that'll make her want to get up and walk.

24:16.660 --> 24:20.490
What~ will the weather~ be tomorrow~?

24:26.840 --> 24:33.010
I'm not a bit smarter at the age of 27
than I was at the age of 15.

24:34.840 --> 24:39.680
I've always been here,
stuck in the same place.

25:18.260 --> 25:24.930
September

25:26.440 --> 25:28.980
It's just like Tsukishima...

25:29.110 --> 25:31.270
to have got that confused for a week!

25:31.690 --> 25:33.230
English class is no big deal.

25:33.530 --> 25:35.280
That's cause Kiso's a pushover.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.120
Akizuki!

25:41.740 --> 25:44.870
Hey, long time no see.
Looks like you guys got a tan.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.040
Yeah, we went to the beach a bunch.

25:47.250 --> 25:49.080
You're still as pale as ever.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.420
What'd you do over summer break?

25:50.590 --> 25:51.540
Worked the whole time.

25:51.670 --> 25:52.800
The whole time?

25:57.760 --> 25:59.590
That's a lonely way to spend
your high school days.

25:59.930 --> 26:02.260
School, part-time job, housework.
School, part-time job, housework.

26:02.430 --> 26:03.720
I skip school sometimes!

26:03.850 --> 26:06.770
Now that you mention it,
you are late a lot, Akizuki.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.400
Yup, this guy never shows up
for 1st period when it rains.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.110
I've got a condition where I can't ride
the subway on rainy mornings.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.400
Whatever, weirdo.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.980
Teacher's Office

26:22.120 --> 26:23.410
Miss Yukino?

26:25.450 --> 26:26.910
Miss Yukino!

26:29.540 --> 26:30.460
Sato...

26:30.580 --> 26:31.290
Miss Yukino...

26:31.420 --> 26:32.420
Sato, save it for later.

26:32.540 --> 26:33.290
Miss Yukino!

26:33.460 --> 26:35.460
- Same goes for the rest of you.
- I'm sorry, everyone.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.090
I'll be here until after 5th period.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.760
After that, I'd be happy to.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.720
Yuki came to school?

26:50.980 --> 26:53.650
You didn't hear about Yuki quittin'

26:53.980 --> 26:57.230
No. I didn't even know who she is.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.490
You have old man Takehara for lit, right?

27:02.160 --> 27:06.160
Yuki was always having trouble
with the 3rd year girls.

27:10.330 --> 27:13.250
Yeah, but Miss Yukino
didn't do anything wrong.

27:14.170 --> 27:17.130
Someone's boyfriend fell for Miss Yukino,

27:17.260 --> 27:20.670
and as payback everyone in the class
treated Miss Yukino terribly.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.840
They spread so many rumors
even her parents heard about them.

27:23.010 --> 27:25.300
It went so far she couldn't
come to school any more.

27:28.270 --> 27:33.900
Yuki's just too kind. She should have
brought it right to the police.

27:34.270 --> 27:37.070
We told Mr. Ito again and again!

27:37.190 --> 27:40.360
But he didn't want to make trouble
for the school in public.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.700
Hey, what's the matter?

27:46.950 --> 27:49.200
Those upperclassmen...

27:51.210 --> 27:53.000
Do you know their names?

28:01.590 --> 28:04.010
Miss Yukino!

28:11.390 --> 28:13.140
He totally sucks at it.

28:13.270 --> 28:14.560
You're so cruel.

28:14.690 --> 28:17.560
But man, you sure go through 'em.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.410
What do you want, frosh?

28:27.580 --> 28:28.740
Are you the 3rd year, Aizawa?

28:28.910 --> 28:30.080
An admirer?

28:31.250 --> 28:32.580
Who the hell are you?

28:34.370 --> 28:36.580
It seems like Miss Yukino is quitting.

28:36.750 --> 28:37.540
Huh?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.960
Like I care about what happens to
that slutty hag.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.380
Who does this guy think he is?

28:45.260 --> 28:46.760
Huh? What's this?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.430
What's your deal?

28:55.940 --> 28:57.150
Let's go tell a teacher...

28:57.270 --> 28:58.940
Never seen this kid before.

28:59.110 --> 29:01.900
Who are you? Fallen for that old hag?

29:02.110 --> 29:05.070
What a creep! Does he even know
how old she is?

29:05.280 --> 29:07.780
Poor guy, she must have tricked him.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.280
She might go for him now, though.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.620
Since she ain't a teacher no more.

29:12.790 --> 29:13.660
Damn straight.

29:13.790 --> 29:15.540
You should thank us.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.780
I'm waiting for the rain.

30:32.030 --> 30:36.200
Narukami no sukoshi toyomite
(A faint clap of thunder)

30:36.370 --> 30:37.830
furazu to mo
(Even if rain comes not)

30:38.040 --> 30:39.330
warewa tomaramu
(I will stay here)

30:39.460 --> 30:41.000
imoshi todomeba
(Together with you)

30:45.800 --> 30:48.380
Yes, that's the correct answer.

30:49.380 --> 30:52.680
That's the right response to the tanka
I told you when we first met.

30:54.600 --> 30:58.230
If it rains, I wonder if you will be staying here?

30:58.770 --> 31:00.350
In response to that verse, I answer...

31:00.560 --> 31:04.060
Even if it doesn't rain, I will be here.

31:04.730 --> 31:08.360
It was in the classic Japanese
literature textbook.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.120
Miss Yukino...

31:16.240 --> 31:17.740
I'm sorry...

31:18.040 --> 31:21.710
I thought you would realize
I was a classic literature teacher.

31:22.250 --> 31:26.420
I mean, everyone at school knows about me.

31:26.880 --> 31:30.090
But you're always off in your
own little world, aren't you?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.260
Hey, what happened to your face?

31:34.720 --> 31:36.720
I was acting like you
and drank too much beer.

31:36.850 --> 31:39.430
Then I tripped and fell on the
Yamanote line platform.

31:39.600 --> 31:40.430
Oh, my!

31:40.600 --> 31:44.230
Just kidding. I got in a fight, that's all.

32:27.940 --> 32:31.440
Look... It looks like we just
swam across the river.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.590
I think this might...

34:21.179 --> 34:22.260
...this might be...

34:23.679 --> 34:24.929
...the happiest...

34:25.929 --> 34:27.770
...time of my life.

34:36.780 --> 34:37.940
Yukino...

34:38.110 --> 34:39.110
Yes?

34:40.909 --> 34:44.449
I think I've fallen in love with you.

35:05.810 --> 35:10.440
Not Yukino... Miss Yukino, remember?

35:19.570 --> 35:21.570
I'm going to be moving next week.

35:21.780 --> 35:23.490
Back to my hometown in Shikoku.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.120
I made the decision a while back.

35:29.910 --> 35:36.170
I was practicing how to walk on my own,
there in that place.

35:37.170 --> 35:38.800
Even if I'm barefoot...

35:42.510 --> 35:43.470
So then...

35:45.680 --> 35:50.140
So I want to thank you for
everything, Akizuki.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.030
Um, thank you for lending me these clothes.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.320
I'll get changed now.

36:06.950 --> 36:08.200
But yours aren't ...

36:36.560 --> 36:39.570
Excuse me... I'm going home.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.400
Thank you for your hospitality.

37:17.610 --> 37:21.940
I made this lunch for myself,
but I made too much.

37:22.150 --> 37:22.980
So if you'd like...

37:23.110 --> 37:25.110
I haven't decided whose shoes yet...

37:25.320 --> 37:26.200
They're women's shoes.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.410
I was acting like you
and drank too much beer

37:28.530 --> 37:30.990
Then I tripped and fell on the
Yamanote line platform.

37:31.160 --> 37:34.040
Narukami no sukoshi toyomite
(A faint clap of thunder)

37:34.160 --> 37:35.750
furazu to mo
(Even if rain comes not)

37:36.210 --> 37:37.790
warewa tomaramu (I will stay here)

37:38.000 --> 37:39.460
imoshi todomeba (Together with you)

38:34.020 --> 38:35.100
Um...

38:35.220 --> 38:39.850
Yukino, please forget what I said earlier.

38:40.730 --> 38:44.730
I was wrong... I hate you after all.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.700
Ever since we first met, you struck me...

38:52.660 --> 38:53.910
...like a person I should avoid.

38:55.540 --> 38:59.540
Drinking beer in the morning,
spouting off some random tanka at me...

39:01.500 --> 39:03.540
You listen all day to other people talking,

39:03.710 --> 39:05.500
yet never say a peep about yourself...

39:05.710 --> 39:08.010
You knew I was a student, didn't you?

39:08.220 --> 39:10.050
That's just unfair!

39:11.300 --> 39:15.390
If I'd known you were a teacher,
I would have never told you about the shoes.

39:15.720 --> 39:19.180
After all, you think
I'll never amount to anything!

39:19.600 --> 39:21.850
So why didn't you say anything to me?

39:22.150 --> 39:26.230
You thought maybe you'd humor
the little kid's fantasies for a while?

39:27.230 --> 39:30.570
Tell me I'll never live up
to my expectations!

39:30.740 --> 39:33.200
Tell me I'll never measure up to my dreams!

39:33.490 --> 39:35.780
You knew from the very beginning!

39:36.410 --> 39:38.240
So tell me, god damn it!

39:38.410 --> 39:39.540
Tell me I'm in your way!

39:39.660 --> 39:41.040
Tell me that little kids should
run along to school!

39:41.170 --> 39:42.750
Tell me that you hate me!

39:43.790 --> 39:44.790
You...

39:45.500 --> 39:47.340
It's because you act like that!

39:47.670 --> 39:49.670
You never say what's important!

39:49.920 --> 39:51.760
You pretend it's none of your business!

39:52.010 --> 39:54.760
You've been living your whole life, alone!!

40:07.900 --> 40:09.280
Every morning!

40:11.360 --> 40:15.570
Every morning I put on my suit
to go to school...

40:16.780 --> 40:18.490
But I was... scared...

40:19.620 --> 40:21.450
I just couldn't go...

40:23.460 --> 40:24.790
In that place...

40:25.290 --> 40:26.250
You...

40:27.380 --> 40:31.260
You... saved me!

40:32.970 --> 40:42.100
I lived on with feelings frozen,
never expressed in words,

40:42.640 --> 40:52.280
And I clumsily held you in my
arms on a rainy night

40:53.820 --> 41:02.540
Street flyers and broken lamps,
everybody was rushing back

41:03.750 --> 41:13.010
It's not you but me who is to blame.
I couldn't hide my own impulsiveness

41:14.720 --> 41:23.980
Lady, you started running through
a deserted station

41:25.190 --> 41:30.060
Unconcerned about getting soaked
from the pouring rain

41:30.360 --> 41:35.320
The sight of you splashing through
puddles disappears

41:35.530 --> 41:40.530
Morning comes quicker in the back alleys,
so I have to get hold of you now

41:40.870 --> 41:45.870
To say, Don't go away, don't go away

41:46.540 --> 41:50.710
Summer ended, and it came time to
switch to our winter uniforms...

41:51.380 --> 41:53.840
I got terrible marks on my final exams...

41:54.380 --> 41:57.340
I wasted who knows how many
pieces of expensive leather...

41:57.550 --> 42:00.010
I worked part-time over winter break as well...

42:00.220 --> 42:02.850
And every time I added a layer
to my clothing,

42:03.060 --> 42:06.350
I wondered to myself...
how was she doing?

42:06.890 --> 42:12.020
I don't have enough strength anymore

Lady, even now you still

don't even open up a little umbrella...

Thanks so much for reading it all...

45:19.740 --> 45:21.680

I was practicing how to walk, too.
I think that now.

45:40.620 --> 45:44.640
One day, when I can walk
much farther on my own...

45:46.860 --> 45:48.420
...I will go see her.
