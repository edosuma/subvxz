<i>Fantastico.</i>

00:26.859 --> 00:29.378
- Are you checking my pulse?
- You were very still.

00:32.503 --> 00:34.812
Well, that was really fun.

00:37.476 --> 00:40.314
I don't know what to
say here. Um...

00:40.979 --> 00:43.216
- I got an idea. Stay right here, okay?
- Okay.

00:43.235 --> 00:45.910
- Let me do something. Stay right here.
- Okay.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.358
We need some dessert.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.982
That's too much.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.201
Nah, definitely not doing that.

01:22.503 --> 01:23.797
Bob!

01:23.914 --> 01:26.386
You. It's... you.

01:26.405 --> 01:28.861
- Nick.
- Right. Nick. How could I forget that?

01:28.873 --> 01:32.176
Sorry to interrupt you.
Wilson let me in.

01:32.836 --> 01:34.231
Well, what are you
doing with that?

01:34.256 --> 01:36.637
That, uh, looks like lady food.

01:36.747 --> 01:37.966
This is for Wilson.

01:37.996 --> 01:40.052
Yeah, Wilson,
here's your grapefruit,

01:40.073 --> 01:42.417
pie and eggs,
just like you like.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.160
- Is it because it's my birthday?
- It's your birthday?

01:45.421 --> 01:47.837
That's why I made it,
'cause it's your birthday.

01:47.863 --> 01:50.248
I know you're lying,
and I'm hurt,

01:50.664 --> 01:53.538
- but I'm gonna eat this anyway.
- See you later, Wilson.

01:53.985 --> 01:56.073
- What are you doing here, Bob?
- The wedding!

01:56.092 --> 01:58.835
I wouldn't miss Cece's
wedding. Where's Jess?

01:58.879 --> 02:01.515
Hey, Nick, what's our la...?

02:01.528 --> 02:02.884
Look who I bumped into--
your dad!

02:02.898 --> 02:04.823
- Dad!
- Your dad is here today, Jess!

Well?

02:19.439 --> 02:21.014
Are the reviews in?

02:21.026 --> 02:23.357
- The reviews for what?
- My new body.

02:23.390 --> 02:24.878
How it moves.

02:24.896 --> 02:26.347
Its pitch, its yaw.

02:26.359 --> 02:28.480
My perfectly sculpted
pubic topiary.

02:28.498 --> 02:30.916
I liked how your body moved

02:30.982 --> 02:32.850
before you knew
what to do with it.

02:38.015 --> 02:40.068
- Want to dance?
- Yeah, right.

02:40.111 --> 02:42.674
Fat kid wants to dance
at the cool college party.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.424
- Nice joke, stranger.
- Come on.

02:44.448 --> 02:47.571
If they make fun of you,
I'll punch them in the penis.

03:00.885 --> 03:03.323
You never cared about
what people thought.

03:03.347 --> 03:06.766
I mean, even last night, with the
window open and the woof howls.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.506
It was very uncomfortable.

03:08.524 --> 03:12.227
Stop threatening to move,
Bernie, and just move!

03:12.245 --> 03:14.275
I love that about you.

03:14.414 --> 03:17.166
I'm gonna go to work. Do you
want to have lunch later?

03:21.470 --> 03:23.313
It's still impressive,

03:23.369 --> 03:25.025
but did you
lose weight down...?

03:25.056 --> 03:26.229
It's slightly smaller.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.953
Doctors--
no explanation.

03:27.966 --> 03:29.134
That's not normal.

03:29.152 --> 03:32.127
- Shut up, Bernie!
- Shut up, Bernie!

03:32.995 --> 03:36.431
He can never find out about
this, because he will kill you.

03:36.449 --> 03:39.108
When I was ten, he caught
me kissing Glenn Ely.

03:39.207 --> 03:41.799
He got some guys from the club
to put the fear of God in him.

03:47.676 --> 03:49.454
Help!

03:49.490 --> 03:52.597
- So, let me deal with him.
- Smile!

03:53.494 --> 03:55.894
- I got to get some new flash cubes.
- Dude,

03:55.920 --> 03:58.014
- keep your mouth shut. Okay?
- Great, fantastic.

03:58.026 --> 03:59.457
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

03:59.469 --> 04:02.475
Why don't we take a walk?
Oh, it's Peg.

04:03.402 --> 04:04.958
- Peg.
- Hi, Jess.

04:04.988 --> 04:07.633
Guess what? I'm at a new school, and
there's an opening for a new teacher,

04:07.647 --> 04:10.241
and you'd be perfect.
Can you come in today?

04:10.288 --> 04:13.700
Yeah, I would love to. I just--
um, my dad's in town, so...

04:13.725 --> 04:16.497
I'm kind of out on a limb here. I
really talked you up to the principal.

04:16.521 --> 04:19.176
Guess what. Spoiler alert.
He's perking me.

04:19.851 --> 04:23.048
- Can you be here in 30 minutes?
- Okay, I'll figure it out.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.904
Amy! Put those back
in your shirt, both of them.

04:26.490 --> 04:28.961
Oh, my God. I have the
chance to teach kids again.

04:28.973 --> 04:30.650
You got to go.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.070
Oh... Dad, you should
come with me.

04:33.088 --> 04:34.476
Yes, you should go
with your daughter!

04:34.507 --> 04:36.857
What am I gonna do, sit in
your car and get mugged?

04:36.882 --> 04:40.544
I mean, I didn't gay my way out of
Vietnam just to be killed by some punk.

04:40.562 --> 04:42.118
No, no. No, I'll stay with him.

04:42.130 --> 04:44.093
- Oh, no, no, that, uh, that doesn't work.
- That's a bad idea.

04:44.099 --> 04:46.297
That's-- I've-I've got stuff
I got to do, so...

04:46.315 --> 04:47.378
- Stuff?
- Yeah.

04:47.409 --> 04:50.044
You don't have any stuff.
Name one stuff.

04:50.573 --> 04:52.118
Documents.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.891
- Documents?
- Yeah, I got documents.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.270
Okay, I get it.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.543
You know, I'm always alone, so,

04:58.568 --> 05:00.184
I'll just, uh... be alone.

05:00.196 --> 05:02.009
- Do not fall for it.
- I am falling for it.

05:02.026 --> 05:04.469
- Do not fall for it. - I am falling for
it right this second. I'm feeling bad.

05:04.482 --> 05:06.238
- I'll stay!
- That's terrific.

05:07.831 --> 05:09.131
Jess... Jess.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.961
Hi! Yay, tomorrow's
your big day! Hooray!

05:11.979 --> 05:14.350
Listen, I'm gonna be a little bit
later than I thought I would be,

05:14.362 --> 05:16.503
but it's gonna be worth it,
because last night...

05:16.516 --> 05:18.105
Just hang on. I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.091
Guys, it's too loud
in here, okay?!

05:21.118 --> 05:22.343
Uncle Shishir!

05:23.866 --> 05:26.322
He had one scene with
Salman Khan in <i>Dabangg 2,</i>

05:26.346 --> 05:28.940
and all of the sudden he thinks he's
Amitabh Bachchan in <i>Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.</i>

05:28.956 --> 05:30.225
I could just tell you later.

05:30.250 --> 05:33.338
I am exhausted, and I still have
to go pick up my wedding sari,

05:33.365 --> 05:34.909
and I still have to
get my hands henna'd.

05:34.927 --> 05:37.289
Okay, look, just send
everybody to their hotels.

05:37.322 --> 05:39.075
I'll have Winston
pick up your sari,

05:39.093 --> 05:42.408
and then after you're done having
your hands tattooed, take a nap.

05:42.427 --> 05:44.578
Now hand the phone to Shishir.

05:45.025 --> 05:47.153
Uncle. Jess.

05:47.469 --> 05:50.806
Shishir, you son of a bitch.
You little son of a bitch.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.616
It is not your day!

05:54.951 --> 05:56.870
- Hey, Winston.
- What's up?

05:56.885 --> 05:58.970
- Anything you want to wish me?
- Look, Winston,

05:58.995 --> 06:02.449
I need you to pick up Cece's wedding
sari and take it to her house.

06:02.642 --> 06:05.442
- You want me to take it to her house?
- Yeah. Just go pick it up.

06:05.467 --> 06:09.181
Ah, wedding sari, for the
celebration of the wedding.

06:09.205 --> 06:11.474
- Yes, nothing else.
- Yeah, I don't know what you're doing,

06:11.493 --> 06:14.158
but just do it, okay?
Um, I have to go.

06:14.196 --> 06:16.265
It's happening!

06:17.493 --> 06:19.652
Peg, hi. Thank you so much
for the interview.

06:19.677 --> 06:21.952
- Sorry I'm late.
- Uh, no interview.

06:21.970 --> 06:23.669
You're getting right in
the soup; you're subbing.

06:23.681 --> 06:25.737
- I need Al to see you in action.
- What? Subbing?

06:25.755 --> 06:28.407
It's a really busy day; I
don't think I could sub...

06:28.522 --> 06:29.811
- Oh, yes you can.
- ...right now.

06:29.817 --> 06:31.448
- What? No.
- This is your chance.

06:31.496 --> 06:33.028
Oh, my...

06:34.398 --> 06:36.977
Ah, stop! You have to stop!

06:41.658 --> 06:43.162
Hey, guys.

06:43.187 --> 06:44.375
All right.

06:44.406 --> 06:46.106
Okay, listen!

06:47.722 --> 06:49.667
Or don't!

06:50.176 --> 06:52.307
But the hell if I'm
not gonna teach!

06:52.389 --> 06:55.341
I'm gonna bring the words
of Mark Twain alive

06:55.366 --> 06:59.399
with only the human voice.

06:59.529 --> 07:00.779
What about you?
You got a girl?

07:00.802 --> 07:02.565
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- No, really?

07:02.577 --> 07:05.205
- No, no, no, no. No girls for me. No.
- Seriously? A good-looking guy like you?

07:05.211 --> 07:07.598
- It'd seem like women would just
flock to you. - No, no, it's not like that.

07:07.623 --> 07:10.385
- Let's talk about you and girls! I don't want
to talk about this. - ...and a young guy.

07:10.411 --> 07:14.880
- This isn't something we should talk about,
Bob, trust me! - Okay, gee whiz, I'm sorry.

07:15.178 --> 07:18.539
- Just freakin' back off.
- I'm sorry I brought it up.

07:22.406 --> 07:24.194
All right.

07:24.864 --> 07:26.331
What?

07:29.636 --> 07:31.154
What?

07:33.165 --> 07:34.957
- There's a girl. Yes.
- There is, see? I told you.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.757
- I knew-- There's always a girl.
- There-- you're right.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.864
- Come on, what's she like?
- She's, uh, not quirky.

07:38.882 --> 07:41.313
- No?
- She's got no bangs.

07:41.341 --> 07:43.306
- No bangs.
- Uh, tall and fat.

07:43.324 --> 07:44.812
- Really?
- Yeah. Really ugly eyes.

07:44.824 --> 07:46.826
- Small, tiny little beady eyes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:46.843 --> 07:49.571
Her name is, uh,
Yolanda Winston.

07:49.701 --> 07:51.218
Yolanda Winston.

07:54.410 --> 07:57.606
Just wallpaper! I have fancy
athletic shoe wallpaper.

07:57.881 --> 07:59.604
Elizabeth, what are you
doing here?

07:59.616 --> 08:01.701
I got here early,
so I wanted to come up.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.657
That shirt is, uh...

08:03.682 --> 08:05.032
12 years old.

08:05.061 --> 08:07.809
- It's the shirt I met you in.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.

08:07.827 --> 08:09.053
Y2 Kitty Kat.

08:09.078 --> 08:10.801
As relevant today
as it was then.

08:10.807 --> 08:12.770
Schmidt, do you have a moment?

08:12.819 --> 08:16.047
- I have unlimited moments.
- I was reviewing the numbers...

08:16.642 --> 08:19.801
Custodial keeps sending us
these spooky Eastern European girls.

08:19.817 --> 08:22.042
You want to see spooky?
Call me spooky again.

08:22.054 --> 08:23.753
I'll spook the ass fat
right out of your lips.

08:23.779 --> 08:24.935
Do you know her?

08:24.959 --> 08:27.303
Mm... no...

08:27.366 --> 08:29.192
- No?
- I...

08:29.541 --> 08:32.376
I feel like I'm trap...
I'm being trapped, am I not?

08:33.217 --> 08:35.527
Then I'll do you a favor
and set you free.

08:35.823 --> 08:37.693
Idiot.

08:38.211 --> 08:40.548
Wait, don't leave.
Elizabeth!

08:40.578 --> 08:43.172
- I don't know why I just did that!
- I knew you couldn't change back!

08:43.191 --> 08:45.512
- But why are you wearing that shirt?!
- I'm not gonna let you make me feel

08:45.532 --> 08:47.689
bad about myself!
I love this shirt!

08:47.713 --> 08:49.563
Y2 Kitty Kat?

08:49.725 --> 08:51.338
I don't need this.

08:51.393 --> 08:53.070
I was fine before
you showed up.

08:53.085 --> 08:57.426
In fact, I said no to a date
tonight to be with you!

08:58.062 --> 08:59.899
I'm gonna
text him "Yes."

08:59.939 --> 09:01.461
And guess what.

09:01.473 --> 09:03.192
I don't care what you think.

09:03.329 --> 09:05.106
See ya, Schmidt.

09:05.321 --> 09:08.256
Without validation, the
parking rates are absurd.

09:13.184 --> 09:16.260
Jamie, enough with the globes.
We get it. You're angry.

09:16.864 --> 09:19.771
Okay, that's lunch.
Be back in an hour.

09:20.907 --> 09:22.907
_

09:22.933 --> 09:24.165
Jess!

09:24.202 --> 09:26.031
- I'm Dr. Foster.
- Oh.

09:26.049 --> 09:32.073
Peg has gone on and on and
on and on and on about you.

09:32.091 --> 09:34.216
So nice to meet you. I'm just
running out for lunch...

09:34.234 --> 09:36.812
- Uh! No, no, need. No need.
- During the lunch that I...

09:36.824 --> 09:38.800
But you don't need.

09:38.825 --> 09:40.596
We can have lunch here.

09:40.615 --> 09:44.184
My secretary is bringing food.

09:44.427 --> 09:46.676
So we'll have a

09:46.706 --> 09:49.542
chitchat, tête-à-tête,

09:49.585 --> 09:52.285
exchange-ideas

09:52.504 --> 09:53.841
kind of lunch.

09:53.853 --> 09:57.227
To see how you'll fit in
to the Coolidge culture.

09:57.249 --> 09:59.993
Um, well, long story short,
I really would love this job,

10:00.005 --> 10:01.830
- I love teaching kids...
- Ha!

10:01.928 --> 10:05.722
Now, what if you weren't
referring to children...

10:06.127 --> 10:07.808
Oh. Uh-huh?

10:08.482 --> 10:10.732
- ...but to baby goats?
- Huh.

10:10.764 --> 10:12.773
That's an interesting question.

10:12.791 --> 10:13.837
Well,

10:13.861 --> 10:16.491
we used to have a school goat

10:16.516 --> 10:18.014
- named Melvin.
- Uh...

10:18.026 --> 10:19.853
He hanged himself,

10:19.867 --> 10:21.648
tragically, on the swing set.

10:22.439 --> 10:23.895
So...

10:23.926 --> 10:26.354
we bought another goat.

10:26.466 --> 10:29.346
Also named Melvin.

10:30.877 --> 10:32.430
Surprise!

10:35.185 --> 10:37.160
Yeah, you can come out now!

10:37.185 --> 10:40.360
I see some-some food over here.
Where my cake at?

10:40.802 --> 10:42.598
Hey, where my cake at?!

10:42.637 --> 10:45.566
I can hear you giggling,
I can see the...

10:45.650 --> 10:48.100
- Where's my sari?
- Something on your face. What's that,

10:48.125 --> 10:51.320
- like, a wedding tattoo? - What do you
mean there's something on my face?

10:56.417 --> 10:59.091
Wait-wait a minute. Hold-hold on,
hold on. What are you doing?

10:59.555 --> 11:01.549
Lettuce, tomato, lettuce,

11:01.567 --> 11:04.013
meat-meat-meat-meat-meat-
meat-meat-meat-meat,

11:04.139 --> 11:06.514
- cheese, lettuce.
- You're a sandwich genius.

11:06.605 --> 11:09.086
Is there anything you don't
know everything about?

11:09.098 --> 11:10.205
Try me.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.208
All right, I will try you.
I've got a question about

11:13.278 --> 11:14.609
- Yolanda Winston.
- Sure.

11:14.621 --> 11:16.983
Well, we've only slept
together once, but,

11:17.004 --> 11:18.528
Bob, I don't know
what she wants.

11:18.559 --> 11:21.881
Well, the first thing you got to
figure out is what do you want.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.170
Well, I don't know how you get a
podcast, but you should look into it.

11:26.942 --> 11:27.742
Bob here.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.952
Hey, Dad, new plan.
Headed over to Cece's.

11:29.977 --> 11:32.643
- How's it going over there?
- Great. We're making sandwiches,

11:32.662 --> 11:34.068
we're talking about girls.

11:34.087 --> 11:36.044
Interesting. Could you hand
the phone to Nick?

11:36.063 --> 11:38.594
- Jess. Yeah, she wants to talk to you.
- Oh, cool. Jess!

11:38.612 --> 11:41.423
- What is going on over there, Nick?!
- Hanging out with my boy Bobby D.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.133
- Bobby D! I love that!
- Talking about girls?!

11:44.158 --> 11:46.182
That's the one thing you
should not be talking about!

11:46.192 --> 11:48.659
- You are freaking out about noth...
- Hey, you know what?

11:48.678 --> 11:51.091
I don't like what's happening here.
I am coming home.

11:53.375 --> 11:54.832
Just relax.
I think he really likes me.

11:54.857 --> 11:57.012
Oh, it's Cece.
I have to take this.

11:57.043 --> 11:58.102
Cece, hi.

11:59.442 --> 12:02.973
- What's going on?
- I fell asleep on my hand!

12:07.054 --> 12:08.267
Oh!

12:08.292 --> 12:10.686
It's not as bad as I thought.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.915
I'm getting married tomorrow,
and I look like Mike Tyson!

12:13.934 --> 12:16.656
Okay, nothing a little cotton
balls and olive oil can't fix.

12:16.668 --> 12:20.408
In a few minutes, we are gonna
laugh about this. We will laugh.

12:20.452 --> 12:21.651
Okay.

12:22.844 --> 12:25.345
- This is funny later.
- Okay.

12:25.398 --> 12:26.704
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, see?

12:26.732 --> 12:27.949
It's coming right off.

12:34.632 --> 12:35.582
Um...

12:39.756 --> 12:41.751
All gone?

12:44.404 --> 12:46.605
Burkas isn't you guys, is it?

12:48.370 --> 12:51.288
This girl really means
a lot to me, Bob.

12:51.384 --> 12:54.122
- And I just don't want to screw it up.
- Why would you screw it up?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.503
I don't want to make excuses,

12:55.521 --> 12:57.492
but my dad was kind of a...

12:57.517 --> 12:59.517
a piece of...

13:00.179 --> 13:02.854
You know, truth be told, Bob,
I'm afraid I'm a lot like him.

13:02.873 --> 13:05.321
The mere fact that
you just said that

13:05.347 --> 13:07.528
means that you're nothing
like your old man.

13:07.964 --> 13:10.626
Any girl would be lucky

13:10.649 --> 13:12.380
- to have a guy like you.
- You mean that?

13:12.386 --> 13:13.892
Yes, I do.

13:15.611 --> 13:18.775
Think I'm gonna say something
that might make you real happy.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.668
That little girl I was
talking about,

13:21.693 --> 13:23.252
Yolanda?

13:23.897 --> 13:26.188
Her name isn't Yolanda.

13:27.005 --> 13:28.574
It's Jess.

13:28.704 --> 13:30.629
She's your daughter.

13:31.536 --> 13:33.186
I'll kill you!

13:33.223 --> 13:35.316
You're dead! You're dead!

13:37.561 --> 13:40.916
Hi, you-you tattooed my friend
this morning for her wedding.

13:40.947 --> 13:43.054
Is there a quick way
of getting it off?

13:43.132 --> 13:45.213
Uh-huh. Okay!

13:46.417 --> 13:48.335
Um, wonderful. Thank
you so much, Dipti.

13:48.354 --> 13:50.087
That's awesome. Thanks.

13:50.146 --> 13:51.746
- It's not coming off.
- Nope, it's not.

13:51.771 --> 13:53.158
Absolutely not.

13:53.186 --> 13:54.805
Okay, look, um, Cece,

13:54.829 --> 13:56.569
I think maybe you
should call Shivrang.

13:56.725 --> 13:59.135
I don't want him to
see me like this, Jess!

13:59.147 --> 14:00.590
- Like, what have you done?!
- What I've done?

14:00.610 --> 14:02.257
You're the dummy who fell
asleep on your hands!

14:02.288 --> 14:04.779
I'm so sorry. That shouldn't
have come out of my mouth.

14:04.798 --> 14:08.292
That was really uncool. I've just
had a crazy 24 hours, and...

14:08.875 --> 14:10.394
I slept with Nick last night.

14:10.419 --> 14:11.958
- You slept with Nick?
- I don't know.

14:11.971 --> 14:14.002
I think it might be the start of
something, like, really amazing.

14:14.014 --> 14:16.146
- Mm-hmm, sure. - I don't want to get my
hopes up, but it could be something.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.340
- Could not be something.
- Makes sense.

14:17.359 --> 14:19.615
- I don't know.
- I have a full beard!

14:19.655 --> 14:21.022
No.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.027
Oh, no, no.

14:23.059 --> 14:25.404
- I'm not scared of you, dude.
- What are you doing with that?

14:25.428 --> 14:27.992
Put that down;
I'm not gonna hurt you.

14:38.104 --> 14:39.111
Okay.

14:39.123 --> 14:40.619
Okay, conversation's over.

14:40.638 --> 14:43.049
Nick, hands up, back away.
What is this?

14:43.067 --> 14:45.417
- Dad, you're coming with me now.
- You want to get rid of me?

14:45.436 --> 14:47.922
- So you two can do it again?
- What?!

14:48.251 --> 14:51.182
You told him?! God, I knew
you would blurt it out.

14:51.207 --> 14:53.252
Shows how much you know;
I didn't blurt it out.

14:53.276 --> 14:55.675
- I told him on purpose.
- Why would you do that?!

14:55.681 --> 14:57.944
- What is wrong with you?!
- I wanted him to like me--

14:57.963 --> 15:00.387
in fact, I want all
fathers to like me.

15:00.406 --> 15:01.748
I wonder what that's about.

15:01.773 --> 15:03.397
W-What, do you owe
money on the rent?

15:03.415 --> 15:06.246
- I mean, what-what is going on here?
- Dad, I don't know what's going on.

15:06.252 --> 15:08.146
We haven't had a chance
to talk it out yet.

15:08.164 --> 15:09.602
- Well, when did this happen?
- Last night.

15:09.608 --> 15:10.908
- Nick!
- Why am I telling you this?

15:10.933 --> 15:14.655
Jess, why are you picking him?
He's a lazy, drunken cable thief.

15:14.674 --> 15:17.343
- Wh-What's wrong with Wilson?
- Dad, there's nothing wrong with Nick.

15:17.349 --> 15:19.837
- You don't even know him.
- I do know him.

15:19.893 --> 15:21.332
I know him.

15:21.402 --> 15:24.477
When I was young,
I was confused, I was lost,

15:24.495 --> 15:25.652
I had no plan.

15:25.683 --> 15:28.163
But I went ahead
and got married anyway.

15:28.209 --> 15:30.372
And if I had figured things out
before I got married,

15:30.390 --> 15:32.516
I might still be
with your mother.

15:32.685 --> 15:34.453
So I do know you.

15:34.961 --> 15:36.617
You're not your father.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.171
You're me.

15:39.724 --> 15:42.833
And I'm not good enough
for my little girl.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.481
Yeah I got my own damn cake,

15:46.515 --> 15:48.374
and you can't have none!

15:50.682 --> 15:53.654
- I got to... No, I really...
- Nick, wait, Nick...

15:53.996 --> 15:55.434
Damn it, Dad!

15:55.460 --> 15:57.232
You know I'm right.

16:00.435 --> 16:02.307
Oh, I have to go.

16:02.324 --> 16:04.443
I have to go back to school now.

16:09.867 --> 16:13.537
You sure you want to be eating so
much cake with a body like that?

16:22.654 --> 16:24.221
Guys?

16:24.757 --> 16:26.507
Guys?

16:29.719 --> 16:31.350
I've had a bad day!

16:32.244 --> 16:33.682
Sit down!

16:33.734 --> 16:35.665
All of you!

16:36.557 --> 16:38.636
What is with everyone today?

16:38.656 --> 16:41.449
Everything started so good.

16:42.285 --> 16:43.848
Boy.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.371
My roommate.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.667
It was good, I'm not gonna lie.

16:48.685 --> 16:49.765
It was very good.

16:49.783 --> 16:52.527
But I can't date my dad.

16:56.568 --> 16:58.206
Look...

16:59.037 --> 17:00.554
life's messy.

17:00.577 --> 17:01.645
It

17:01.670 --> 17:03.520
kicks you in the ass.

17:03.546 --> 17:06.339
That's right, I said "ass."

17:06.877 --> 17:08.622
But it does,
it kicks you in the ass.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.646
And, um...

17:11.259 --> 17:14.191
the messy parts are the...

17:14.868 --> 17:16.829
best parts.

17:24.272 --> 17:25.897
Thank you, Miguel.

17:25.963 --> 17:28.483
The gesture is very sweet.

17:28.683 --> 17:31.277
- These are very bad for you.
- I've got a car.

17:31.299 --> 17:33.019
I could take you to the movies.

17:33.707 --> 17:35.940
No, you don't...
You do?

17:40.311 --> 17:41.776
Jess called you?

17:41.815 --> 17:43.577
Yeah, she said you needed me.

17:43.761 --> 17:47.270
She also told me to watch out for the
girl who looked like Mandy Patinkin

17:47.302 --> 17:49.328
We can't get married like this.

17:49.340 --> 17:51.914
Hey, look, if this is
our biggest problem,

17:52.079 --> 17:53.448
I'll take it.

17:53.479 --> 17:55.073
I'll make a call and fix it.

18:02.351 --> 18:05.426
Now that your mom's dead, do you
do all the landlording yourself?

18:09.566 --> 18:10.983
Uh-huh.

18:16.209 --> 18:17.894
You want to dance?

18:19.283 --> 18:21.701
I'm wearing the shirt
that you got me.

18:23.578 --> 18:26.059
Did you think I threw it away?

18:29.024 --> 18:30.668
Frogetaboutit.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.793
- Go home, Schmidt.
- I don't want to go home, Elizabeth.

18:34.143 --> 18:35.887
Look, I want to be with you.

18:36.050 --> 18:38.509
Anl-I don't care who knows it.

18:41.208 --> 18:42.771
Hey, Geppetto.

18:42.966 --> 18:44.666
Make with the "oom pah pah."

19:14.775 --> 19:18.027
We have a pump that can blow
that thing up in, like,

19:18.408 --> 19:19.246
two seconds.

19:19.270 --> 19:22.546
I prefer to do this
the old-fashioned way.

19:22.786 --> 19:26.307
I know that's not the way things
are done around here.

19:26.488 --> 19:28.414
So long as I'm in town,

19:28.450 --> 19:31.849
I am going to sleep
between you and him.

19:31.868 --> 19:34.353
Dad, you don't have
to worry about me.

19:34.371 --> 19:36.257
I know you think
this is gonna be a mess,

19:36.275 --> 19:38.279
but it's my mess.

19:38.363 --> 19:40.033
Jess,

19:40.176 --> 19:42.014
I'm your father

19:42.193 --> 19:45.019
I'll always worry about you.

20:39.018 --> 20:43.036

with the mole patterns on my back.

20:45.797 --> 20:47.992

20:48.010 --> 20:50.311
Oh, is that how it is now?

21:00.210 --> 21:02.284
Is that a golden telescope?

21:02.629 --> 21:06.282
You know how much I love
to explore space and time, man!

21:06.445 --> 21:08.370
- Thank you! - Happy birthday!
- I love you.

21:08.395 --> 21:11.020
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, happy birthday!

21:11.039 --> 21:13.255
It's the birthday boy.

21:13.383 --> 21:14.858
Come here, I'm gonna
set it up for you.

21:14.876 --> 21:17.314
- Why can't I have the telescope?
- But it's my telescope.

21:17.336 --> 21:20.254
Thought it was for me.

21:27.728 --> 21:29.516
- Get in, get into it, man.
- Yay, the birthday boy!

21:29.541 --> 21:33.066
- Get into it. - Get in there, birthday boy!
- Happy birthday, Winston.
