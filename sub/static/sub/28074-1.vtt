00:38.371 --> 00:43.752
[Mashama Bailey] When I left Georgia,
there was a piece of me that was missing.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.551
Maybe it was the sun,
maybe it was the marsh,

00:52.302 --> 00:55.638
maybe it was the smell of cut grass.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.351
Something was calling me.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.574
And then to come back to the Golden Coast,

01:16.534 --> 01:20.830
and connect with the people and the land,

01:22.916 --> 01:25.794
there's something
started to fill my soul.

01:39.390 --> 01:45.772
I think that there's a sense of pride
and a sense of peace that happens

01:45.855 --> 01:47.690
when you decide to come back home.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.494
[theme music playing]

03:22.160 --> 03:24.120
[Osayi Endolyn]
When I walk through Savannah,

03:24.829 --> 03:25.997
there's no better place

03:26.414 --> 03:30.335
to think about the spirits of the past,
because they're here.

03:36.049 --> 03:40.845
When you walk into The Grey,
you immediately understand

03:41.804 --> 03:45.934
this is a place that is evoking
the spirit of times past.

03:47.685 --> 03:53.399
The restaurant lives in a formerly
segregated Jim Crow-era bus station.

03:55.443 --> 04:01.074
What The Grey does is it says,
"We have this past, we have this history,

04:02.158 --> 04:06.204
and here is where we're going."
It's a forward-moving conversation.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.542
Southern food is so charged,

04:11.626 --> 04:14.921
particularly when it comes
to a black person cooking that food.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.007
"Black cooking" in the South means

04:18.091 --> 04:21.386
black eyed peas,
shrimp and grits, fried chicken.

04:22.887 --> 04:26.266
Mashama Bailey has shown Savannah that,

04:26.349 --> 04:29.769
yes, you can celebrate
these traditional dishes,

04:30.645 --> 04:32.313
but we can push it, too.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.232
We can expand.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.612
When you look at The Grey's menu,

04:39.696 --> 04:42.657
you might be surprised,
seeing cucumber gazpacho.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.702
But, guess what?
We grow cucumber in the South.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.663
If you want to blend cucumber

04:48.746 --> 04:52.458
and mix it with these delicious
local herbs and summer tomatoes,

04:52.542 --> 04:53.751
that's a Southern dish.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.881
[Lolis Eric Elie]
What's so beautiful about Mashama

04:59.299 --> 05:03.052
is the extent
to which she can express everything

05:03.136 --> 05:07.098
from white-tablecloth fine dining
that she studied in France

05:07.807 --> 05:11.144
to the Black tradition of the South
in Savannah, Georgia.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.731
Her food embodies that kind of bridge.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.737
She's crafting a personal cuisine
of her own,

05:20.820 --> 05:22.238
and that's why it resonates.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.506
[birds chirping]

05:55.438 --> 05:57.648
[Bailey] When you come to Savannah,

05:58.441 --> 06:02.403
you're in this city
that's steeped in Southern tradition.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.241
They love the past.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.827
There are trolley tours,

06:11.371 --> 06:14.332
people dressed up in colonial attire.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.546
People come down and they wanna see that.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.926
They want the black chef at
The Grey restaurant to be frying chicken.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.222
I just find that to be a slap in the face.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.517
That's not the best
that Savannah has to offer.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.311
Should we put the sausage in there?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.105
[man] Yeah, let it go soak
all the way through.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.689
-[Bailey] Yeah.
-[man] How many you wanna put in there?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.650
Just the three. Wanna open them up?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.985
That's a good idea,
and I'll give them to you.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.070
[Bailey] Yeah.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.327
I know. It smells good, right?

06:54.664 --> 06:58.960
African American history in this area

06:59.502 --> 07:01.295
is so rich.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.674
-[man] Oh, these look nice.
-[Bailey chuckles]

07:06.134 --> 07:08.636
[Bailey] These traditions and food,

07:09.554 --> 07:14.308
it's about the storytelling
and preserving heritage.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.984
Whenever you get
a bunch of people at a table,

07:23.609 --> 07:26.988
you learn about the people at that table.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.409
The young folks learn about their elders.

07:31.784 --> 07:36.706
They learn about their culture
and listen to stories about the past.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.126
I feel this responsibility

07:40.209 --> 07:44.839
to educate people through my cooking.

07:44.922 --> 07:45.840
There you go.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.341
[woman] Oh, my God.

07:47.425 --> 07:51.220
[Bailey] That's the part of Savannah
that I want to share.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.106
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

08:03.941 --> 08:06.402
-[man] That is good.
-[Bailey] That's delicious.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.255
It's sweet.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.894
[food processor whirring]

08:41.604 --> 08:42.563
[Bailey] We'll clean 'em up.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.785
Oh, this is like...

08:58.079 --> 08:58.913
It's good.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.543
I grew up in Savannah.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.963
My mom was 19 when she had me,

09:08.005 --> 09:11.676
and we had a little two-bedroom apartment
in a black neighborhood.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.723
As a child in Savannah,
there was just a sense of freedom here.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.565
There were kids on stoops
and doors were open,

09:25.648 --> 09:28.025
and everyone would just
run to each other's houses.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.905
And you'd play old maid
on the porch with your friends.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.828
After playing for three,
four hours out in the sun,

09:39.620 --> 09:44.375
you would go to your neighbor's house
to purchase these little Popsicles.

09:46.294 --> 09:50.339
We call them "thrills,"
and it's exactly how it sounds.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.967
It's thrilling to get a thrill.

10:03.936 --> 10:09.609
And then I would come home,
sit around the table and have dinner.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.487
My grandmother would be there.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.742
And she would have a pot of grits on

10:18.492 --> 10:22.204
and then she would have fish
frying in the cast iron.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.457
She didn't have a lot of money,

10:25.124 --> 10:30.796
but the way she cooked
was tremendously generous.

10:33.424 --> 10:39.472
Cooking was a way that she just
let us all know how much she loved us.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.895
And that was
a very poetic time of my life.

10:55.446 --> 11:00.618
I found that the heart
of many relationships

11:00.701 --> 11:02.662
is surrounded by a meal.

11:05.706 --> 11:11.837
It really cemented what I think life is
and what I want out of life.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.016
[children laughing]

11:41.033 --> 11:43.411
[Catherine Bailey]
When Mashama was growing up,

11:44.537 --> 11:48.791
looking at the differences
between the white neighborhood

11:49.709 --> 11:52.378
and the black neighborhood,

11:54.296 --> 11:56.424
the scale wasn't balanced.

11:57.591 --> 12:02.430
Opportunities were to work at a factory
or being the help.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.814
We had to go somewhere
where there were more doors open.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.488
[Bailey] When I turned 11,
we moved into this middle-class

12:19.572 --> 12:22.950
African American neighborhood
in New York City.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.707
There were a lot of doctors
and lawyers and accountants.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.962
My parents were working all the time.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.466
When they weren't working,
they were going to school.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.553
All they wanted was that American dream.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.729
Every move that they made
and all of their sacrifices

12:52.062 --> 12:54.482
was so they could live
a little bit better.

12:57.234 --> 13:01.238
But one thing
that was sacrificed was food.

13:03.199 --> 13:07.620
Back home, it always smelled like food,
even in the middle of the day.

13:09.038 --> 13:14.293
But in New York City, working and school
was more important than cooking.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.714
It wasn't the same.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.806
I felt like there was a piece of me
that was missing.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.563
I longed to be back in the South.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.369
[indistinct chatter]

13:56.043 --> 13:58.420
[Bailey] There's a huge labor force
in the South.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.590
And when they go out in the morning,

14:01.674 --> 14:05.511
they want a meal
that is going to sustain them.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.139
Yeah, there's syrup in the box
and your butter, as well, okay?

14:09.223 --> 14:10.057
Enjoy the rest of your day.

14:10.140 --> 14:14.353
[Bailey] That's why beef liver and grits
was invented, why it was born.

14:17.648 --> 14:23.028
You have this really rich protein
that boosts your energy.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.034
You have grits that are very humble.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.956
It's a quintessential Southern breakfast.

14:38.419 --> 14:42.047
A few years ago,
we were thinking about doing something

14:42.131 --> 14:45.593
for New Year's Eve
that was really over the top.

14:47.469 --> 14:52.016
One of the things that I loved in France
was eating  foie gras.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.978
And that's when I had this epiphany.

14:56.687 --> 15:01.901
Instead of doing beef liver and grits,
why not do a  foie  and grit dish?

15:06.530 --> 15:09.950
It was really this morph
of something Southern

15:10.034 --> 15:13.245
into something
that is completely decadent.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.168
You have very humble beginnings,

15:19.251 --> 15:23.505
and then you have it topped
with something rich and sophisticated.

15:25.049 --> 15:29.428
And what really melds them together
is just a good, old-fashioned gravy.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.973
It's Mashama as a little girl
on the plate,

15:33.057 --> 15:37.436
and it's also Mashama
as a grown culinary force on the plate.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.067
It illustrates my culinary journey.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.416
That's what's up.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.171
Just eating grits out of the pot
like I'm home.

16:19.895 --> 16:26.318
Hi. Can I order a hot pastrami
with shaved onion and provolone cheese?

16:36.829 --> 16:37.955
[deli worker] And would you
like a pickle with that?

16:38.038 --> 16:39.665
Yes, please. Please.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.545
For my parents, progress was education.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.715
It was not a question
that I would go to college.

16:48.799 --> 16:53.303
When I started looking
into different avenues that I can take,

16:54.638 --> 16:56.432
nothing really interested me.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.564
So I was like, "All right,
I guess I'll just do what my parents did.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.107
I guess I'll just go into social work."

17:13.198 --> 17:17.244
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I was just beaming.
I was so proud of her.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.084
[Catherine] It was important
that she graduated from college.

17:25.502 --> 17:29.757
This was something
that we wanted her to complete.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.220
[Bailey] I got a psychology degree,

17:37.556 --> 17:41.393
and I started working with kids
at this homeless shelter.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.231
And that was super heavy for me.

17:48.150 --> 17:52.821
I just felt overwhelmed,
and I wasn't doing a good job.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.911
And then I got fired.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.626
That was a shock to the system.

18:13.133 --> 18:17.554
That's when it set in that I needed
to figure out what I wanted to do.

18:52.297 --> 18:57.594
When I got fired from my job,
I was just sort of on autopilot.

19:02.307 --> 19:06.895
Around that time, one of my best friends
was going to culinary school.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.817
And I always had this fondness with food,

19:13.152 --> 19:17.030
but I thought, "I don't have money
to go to culinary school.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.284
I'm just starting to pay off
my student loans."

19:21.827 --> 19:24.246
He was like, "You don't need money.
You can go to work-study."

19:24.329 --> 19:28.167
And I thought,
"A-ha! Maybe I'll try cooking."

19:31.295 --> 19:34.548
There was this externship
and I signed up for it.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.470
Lo and behold, I'm on a plane to France.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.187
I went to work at a château
with Anne Willan.

19:49.396 --> 19:54.902
It was this beautiful castle
on top of a hillside.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.740
We had herb gardens and vegetable gardens,

19:59.823 --> 20:02.117
and we went down to the market
twice a week,

20:02.201 --> 20:04.244
and it was all this color.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.875
And I thought this was heaven.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.633
Living in this environment,

20:17.716 --> 20:21.220
where you're completely connected
to the ingredients,

20:21.887 --> 20:24.723
and slow, all-day cooking.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.769
I just soaked it up.

21:10.602 --> 21:16.692
When I went back to New York City,
I landed a job as a personal chef.

21:18.819 --> 21:25.784
But when I told my parents, it immediately
brought them back to the '50s.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.168
[Dave] She had gotten a job

21:35.252 --> 21:38.046
with this white family
out in the Hamptons,

21:38.588 --> 21:41.675
which is a really ritzier New York
on Long Island.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.348
[Catherine] And we didn't like the image.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.768
-I didn't like the image at all.
-No, not at all.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.444
[Catherine] She was
more like a live-in maid.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.946
-[Dave] Like the help.
-[Catherine] Yeah, the help.

22:05.240 --> 22:10.871
It didn't look like progress to me.
It was more like... a setback.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.627
[Bailey] They just didn't understand.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.215
They just saw a black woman
working in a house for white folks.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.178
That's not the chef that I wanted to be.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.681
I didn't want to be the maid.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.520
I wanted to be something
more elevated than that.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.904
Oh, my God, that looks amazing.

22:59.169 --> 23:04.007
So, tonight, we're doing crudo.
We're not doing fish toast.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.219
And then tomorrow, we're gonna have
an extra prep person

23:07.636 --> 23:09.638
to help with the new dishes.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.641
So, then we'll just focus
on plating the dishes.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.393
-Does that make sense?
-[man] That makes sense.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.895
Okay. All right, thank you, everyone.

23:17.312 --> 23:21.274
[Bailey] I wanted to take 
my cooking seriously,

23:22.692 --> 23:24.986
and I knew that in order for me
to do that,

23:25.070 --> 23:27.114
I had to go into fine dining.

23:29.574 --> 23:34.121
Growing up, I wasn't exposed
to a fine dining environment.

23:35.163 --> 23:39.501
We never went to restaurants.
My parents just couldn't afford it.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.964
I was going into a whole different world.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.557
I immediately started at the bottom.

23:54.558 --> 23:59.062
I worked all the stations,
I took from each station I worked,

23:59.688 --> 24:05.485
and once I could take the heat,
then I wanted to learn from a chef.

24:09.114 --> 24:13.452
I had heard about Prune
throughout my entire career.

24:15.620 --> 24:18.582
[laughing]

24:18.665 --> 24:21.168
[Elie] Prune, it was one of the places
you were supposed to go.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.503
Everybody was talking about it.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.674
Lot of what Gabrielle Hamilton
did at Prune

24:28.383 --> 24:31.386
was take, sort of lowly ingredients,
like saltine crackers,

24:31.470 --> 24:35.265
and do things with them
that were magical...

24:37.517 --> 24:40.854
in ways that most chefs
might not have thought to do.

24:45.358 --> 24:50.113
[Bailey] The type of food that Gabrielle
was cooking was so simple,

24:52.324 --> 24:56.453
taking a few ingredients
and having them really sing.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.750
And I really thought
that's what food is all about.

25:05.337 --> 25:10.175
I was at Prune for about three years
and I was happy.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.260
I was growing.

25:14.638 --> 25:19.100
I'd finally found an environment
that I felt at home in.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.950
[Johno Morisano]
So, what's the next big switch?

25:35.575 --> 25:40.580
[Bailey] So, I wanna do a rabbit-sorghum
mustard glaze with, like, cayenne.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.707
[Morisano] I think
it's gonna be really good.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.794
The Dijon is so traditionally French,

25:45.877 --> 25:48.547
but then you throw cayenne
and sorghum into it, and it's like...

25:48.630 --> 25:50.090
Yeah, it turns into something else.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.133
It turns into something Southern, I think.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.260
-[Bailey] Yeah, I think so.
-Yeah.

25:54.386 --> 25:58.223
[Morisano] When I was trying to find
my business partner for The Grey,

25:58.890 --> 26:03.186
I called Gabrielle Hamilton,
and Gabrielle said, "Talk to Mashama."

26:03.895 --> 26:06.314
-And so, I met Mashama.
-[inaudible]

26:06.398 --> 26:10.443
We had an hour in the schedule,
and I'm a very regimented guy.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.195
If I have an hour, it's an hour.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.992
And four hours later, we were still
together in a bar, having drinks,

26:17.742 --> 26:20.829
and all we did was talk about food.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.207
It was almost
like being with an old friend.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.875
[both laughing]

26:25.959 --> 26:28.878
If you bring that ugali in,
then the bridges--

26:28.962 --> 26:31.339
-Would you like me to make you some ugali?
-I would like it.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.510
[Morisano] I knew right there I wanted her
to be my partner in The Grey.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.513
I love the fact that we have things
so under control here

26:38.930 --> 26:41.641
that we can just sit and eat
a bowl of pasta and have a glass of wine.

26:42.475 --> 26:44.102
[Bailey] From your mouth to God's ears.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.903
When I met Johno,

26:55.905 --> 27:00.493
I found out that the restaurant
was going to be located in Savannah,

27:02.871 --> 27:05.665
and I was immediately intrigued.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.465
So I'd come down to view the space.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.510
We get out of the car and I look up,

27:17.594 --> 27:21.056
and I can see that we're on
Martin Luther King Boulevard,

27:21.556 --> 27:24.142
across the street
from where my parents got married,

27:24.684 --> 27:27.687
in a city that I lived in
for my childhood.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.736
We walked inside,

27:34.819 --> 27:40.700
and it was this old Greyhound bus station
that was initially segregated.

27:47.832 --> 27:53.588
And I walked through the seating area
where the ticket counter was,

27:55.465 --> 27:57.884
and in the back,
there's the Colored waiting room.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.058
And I thought, "How unfair."

28:07.102 --> 28:08.770
My ancestors were here,

28:09.270 --> 28:12.399
and so many struggles
have happened in this building.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.031
I felt a connection.

28:22.951 --> 28:26.121
I just let that take me with it.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.972
I knew that I was on the right path.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.612
Um, we're gonna do this tomorrow,

28:59.696 --> 29:02.282
and we need to figure out
what we're gonna do with quail,

29:02.365 --> 29:04.534
'cause that whole thing has to change.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.828
-Yeah.
-Should we just fry it?

29:07.662 --> 29:10.165
-Fried quail?
-Fried quail with molasses,

29:10.248 --> 29:13.710
-blackstrap molasses.
-Sauce would be nice with cucumber.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.921
We have all those peppers up there.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.759
We have so many peppers,
and I know peppers are in the meatballs,

29:20.842 --> 29:23.261
-but we can do like a...
-Pepper relish or--

29:23.344 --> 29:26.473
Yeah, we could do pickled peppers
or something, you know?

29:28.016 --> 29:30.935
When I initially came down
to think about this restaurant,

29:31.686 --> 29:36.775
I had a few months to figure out
what was gonna be our breakout menu.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.777
Then if we need a little acid...

29:38.860 --> 29:41.988
[Bailey] Up until that point,
I worked as a sous chef,

29:42.071 --> 29:46.618
emulating the wants and desires
of this creative genius.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.369
And then all of a sudden,

29:48.703 --> 29:52.207
I have an opportunity
to really express myself.

29:56.085 --> 29:59.631
I started thinking about,
what kind of chef was I?

29:59.839 --> 30:02.759
Was I the chef that just kinda
looked at an ingredient,

30:02.842 --> 30:06.137
and all of a sudden,
I made this crazy dish out of it?

30:07.222 --> 30:10.391
Or was I a kind of chef
that took older recipes

30:10.475 --> 30:13.812
and reinterpret them?
What kind of chef am I?

30:21.653 --> 30:24.197
[Morisano] When Mashama started to develop
her first menu,

30:24.697 --> 30:28.368
she read book after book
and sought inspiration.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.996
Any moment she could get
to travel somewhere, she would go.

30:39.212 --> 30:43.466
Mashama would come to me with a dish
and she would say, "Taste this."

30:43.550 --> 30:44.592
And I would taste it.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.470
And she'd go, "What do you think?"
And I would tell her.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.848
And she would go back into the kitchen.

30:50.682 --> 30:55.061
It was really important to her
to do it right and do it well.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.447
[Bailey] After I wrote the menu,
I was very nervous,

31:07.031 --> 31:09.742
but I sent a copy of the first menu
to Gabrielle.

31:11.327 --> 31:14.497
She looked at it and she was like,
"This food is all over the place.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.960
I don't know what this menu is telling me.

31:19.085 --> 31:20.670
It's not really telling me a story."

31:25.800 --> 31:31.097
It really hit Mashama hard
how difficult the undertaking was.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.938
Something was missing
and I wasn't sure what it was.

31:41.941 --> 31:48.865
I felt that I need to learn
about who I am and what I had to say.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.528
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

32:37.038 --> 32:40.375
[Bailey] When I returned to Savannah,
I was super nostalgic.

32:40.833 --> 32:43.711
I thought I could almost pick up
where I left off,

32:44.671 --> 32:49.217
but I did not know this city at all
through adult eyes.

32:50.343 --> 32:53.721
I was on my own. I had no friends here.

32:54.555 --> 32:57.558
I realized very quickly
that I was an outsider.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.897
-Here you go, ma'am.
-Thank you.

33:03.147 --> 33:06.818
One day, I went to this place
called the Mayflower.

33:07.527 --> 33:12.615
And I order deviled crabs,
and every meal comes with a dressing.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.785
I take one taste of it...

33:17.412 --> 33:19.414
and I'm back in my grandmother's kitchen.

33:33.511 --> 33:37.306
And I have this a-ha moment that 
I've been eating this way all my life...

33:39.642 --> 33:41.269
and that I wasn't aware

33:41.352 --> 33:46.315
that there was actually restaurants
built around the food that I grew up on.

33:48.568 --> 33:52.030
I think that there's something
that I buried with that little girl

33:52.113 --> 33:54.490
that moved to New York City
when she was 11.

33:59.829 --> 34:03.541
I wanted to reacquaint myself
with the South.

34:11.674 --> 34:14.135
I started reading old cookbooks

34:15.595 --> 34:20.141
to learn about the first
African-American chefs in this country.

34:25.396 --> 34:29.650
Who was cooking before me
in this environment,

34:30.151 --> 34:32.070
and what can I learn from them?

34:35.782 --> 34:37.200
[indistinct chatter]

34:40.828 --> 34:41.954
Thank you, Mr. Hayes.

34:42.038 --> 34:48.044
I started introducing myself to people
and learning about the food culture here.

34:48.127 --> 34:51.005
-How do you know a watermelon is ready?
-[woman] I slap mine.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.967
-And what you looking for?
-I'm listening for the sound.

34:55.343 --> 34:58.721
[Bailey] I really wanted to educate myself

34:58.805 --> 35:03.684
on different climates, different terroir,
different Southern ingredients.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.646
[inaudible]

35:07.480 --> 35:09.107
Yeah, so you just...

35:10.483 --> 35:11.943
Hey, look at you.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.820
-[Bailey laughing] Yeah.
-[farmer] I don't believe you.

35:17.573 --> 35:21.536
[farmer] Now, you know what I think
is amazing about this whole thing is?

35:21.786 --> 35:24.205
Like, we're walking back into time

35:24.455 --> 35:28.668
-and this is what we did. Okra.
-Mmm-hmm.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.294
-[farmer] It's West African.
-Yeah.

35:32.171 --> 35:35.341
[chuckles] You'll be here.
Where you going? Orlando?

35:36.217 --> 35:38.636
-That's gonna be really nice.
-[both laughing]

35:38.719 --> 35:41.639
[farmer] Thank you, lady. You are tough.

35:42.682 --> 35:46.394
[Bailey] Having this open dialogue
with these farmers

35:46.477 --> 35:49.772
gave me a true sense of where I was.

35:50.606 --> 35:53.025
-How do you like to cook them?
-[farmer] Succotash.

35:53.317 --> 35:56.028
[Bailey] Yeah, that's my favorite,
succotash.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.364
-[farmer] Succotash! Oh, yes.
-[Bailey laughing]

35:58.447 --> 36:00.241
-That's my favorite.
-[farmer] You can smell it.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.951
You can smell it a mile down the road.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.036
[indistinct speech]

36:05.913 --> 36:10.626
-[insects chirping]
-[water sloshing]

36:19.886 --> 36:21.554
I got some work to do, huh?

36:21.637 --> 36:23.181
-[fisherman 1] Mmm-hmm.
-[Bailey] Mmm-hmm.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.412
-[fisherman 2] You know, some of those--
-[Bailey] These are pretty!

36:46.495 --> 36:47.330
[fisherman 2] Yeah.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.750
[Bailey] These are pretty.
These are awesome.

36:50.833 --> 36:53.794
-[fisherman 2] Those are the best.
-Yeah, these are good.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.924
[Bailey] As I've started to learn 
about Georgia,

36:58.883 --> 37:03.804
I realized that the tradition here
is so rich.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.265
[fisherman 2] Should be close.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.517
[Bailey] I wasn't even aware of it.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.437
Oh, it's right there.

37:13.522 --> 37:16.359
These border islands along the coast,

37:17.735 --> 37:20.446
this was an area
that no one wanted to live.

37:25.034 --> 37:29.956
It's humid and buggy and hot.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.168
Right after slavery,

37:34.252 --> 37:38.047
a lot of African Americans
lived on these islands.

37:41.175 --> 37:44.971
And they learned
how to cultivate the land.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.847
Look at that sucker.

37:47.765 --> 37:52.270
They were fishing and crabbing
and oyster farming.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.192
Okay.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.194
Four more months, they'll be ready.

38:00.569 --> 38:03.197
[Bailey] I didn't know
black people ate oysters,

38:03.531 --> 38:07.827
and not only do they eat oysters,
they made a living off of oysters.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.416
Years and years later,
throughout all these hardships,

38:14.125 --> 38:18.296
the people who have been
working the waters for generations

38:19.171 --> 38:22.091
are keeping these traditions alive.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.180
You can't help to be humbled
by that kind of history.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.939
[Endolyn] So much of Southern food
has been forged

39:19.023 --> 39:22.860
from people who came from Africa
and their descendants.

39:23.986 --> 39:27.073
People were brought here in chains,

39:27.656 --> 39:31.285
ripped apart from their loved ones,
their language, their lives,

39:31.744 --> 39:36.624
and made to forge a country
without any say in the matter.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.422
Because of those atrocities,

39:43.506 --> 39:47.760
so many people moved away
to forge something better.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.647
After so much time away,

40:00.147 --> 40:06.112
Mashama had this openness
to being back in the South

40:07.029 --> 40:10.574
and learning more
about the story of Southern food.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.497
[Bailey] I was soaking in
all that heritage

40:16.580 --> 40:17.540
and all that knowledge,

40:18.124 --> 40:20.751
and there's a sadness
that comes with that.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.513
[fireworks bursting]

40:36.016 --> 40:39.145
[Bailey] But it's also
this great sense of pride...

40:44.775 --> 40:48.070
because you look
at the beauty of survival...

40:51.157 --> 40:53.075
the fruitfulness of hope.

40:53.325 --> 40:55.703
[children cheering]

40:55.786 --> 40:59.248
[Bailey] You realize
how resilient your culture is.

41:23.272 --> 41:29.445
Learning about history in this area
was so empowering.

41:31.071 --> 41:36.076
I started to see where I wanted to go
with the food.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.663
That confidence started to reawaken.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.583
I became this chef

41:42.666 --> 41:45.544
that was looking backwards
in order to look forward.

41:45.628 --> 41:50.299
New ticket. Order fire.
Meatball, clam and a fish toast.

41:50.382 --> 41:53.886
[Morisano] One day, Mashama decided
we are changing this menu.

41:53.969 --> 41:55.721
What we're gonna do
from this point forward

41:55.804 --> 41:58.516
is reclaim African-American history,

41:58.849 --> 42:01.393
and we're going to advance Southern food.

42:02.228 --> 42:05.356
In that moment, all those experiences,
her heritage,

42:06.482 --> 42:12.696
her readings, her memories,
her life in New York City,

42:13.781 --> 42:15.324
it all came together for her.

42:17.159 --> 42:20.579
She would come to me with a dish,
and she would say, "Taste this,"

42:20.663 --> 42:23.624
and she would walk away.
There was no doubt anymore.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.130
[Bailey] I was ready to portray
my Southern heritage.

42:33.634 --> 42:37.763
I started focusing on rice,
fresh Southern vegetables,

42:38.430 --> 42:41.433
crab, shrimp and oysters.

42:45.062 --> 42:48.857
And then I wanted to focus
on young Mashama.

42:51.110 --> 42:55.114
So, after the guests have dinner,
we clear their plates,

42:55.364 --> 42:56.824
and we give them a thrill.

42:58.617 --> 43:00.619
Locals would come in and be like,

43:00.703 --> 43:03.038
"What? You know what a thrill is? What?"

43:03.956 --> 43:05.374
That made me feel good

43:06.917 --> 43:09.503
because they understand
that I have roots here.

43:12.047 --> 43:14.758
It's a little part of my history
on the plate.

43:17.094 --> 43:22.141
Just in case you were wondering
why Savannah's such a special place.

43:33.819 --> 43:36.739
-Full of the sunshine. Full of sunshine.
-[Bailey] And they're so warm.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.699
Yeah. See, you put it in my hands.

43:38.782 --> 43:41.076
-I'm gonna eat it.
-[Bailey laughing] Good, eat it.

43:48.626 --> 43:49.835
[deli worker] You live in the city?

43:49.918 --> 43:52.504
I used to. Now, I live in Georgia.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.634
-Definitely a slower pace than New York.
-[Bailey laughs]

44:04.683 --> 44:08.228
He's like, "We were cracking pepper
at the table." I'm like, "Really?"

44:15.778 --> 44:18.280
-Salty fresh. [laughs]
-[fisherman 1] Salty fresh.

44:18.364 --> 44:19.323
Yeah. [laughs]

44:26.914 --> 44:30.167
[farmer] Here's this. I'll trade you.
Be careful with it.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.751
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

45:22.553 --> 45:27.891
[Catherine] I remember when Mashama jumped
in the front seat of the Galaxie 500.

45:27.975 --> 45:28.851
[Dave] I was thinking about that.

45:28.934 --> 45:30.644
[Catherine] Your legs
weren't even long enough

45:30.728 --> 45:31.812
to touch the pedals.

45:31.895 --> 45:34.732
I had got my back turned,

45:34.815 --> 45:39.027
-and the car is rolling down the street.
-[all laughing]

45:39.111 --> 45:42.573
Mashama was determined
to do things her way.

45:42.823 --> 45:43.824
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

45:43.907 --> 45:44.908
She had a strong personality

45:44.992 --> 45:46.577
- even as a baby.
-Yeah.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.288
I remember the park was there,
and that's where...

45:49.371 --> 45:53.041
Our daughter is head chef

45:53.834 --> 45:57.755
in a Jim Crow-era building.

45:58.756 --> 46:04.136
She opened our eyes to a whole new way
of how we were gonna make it.

46:06.513 --> 46:11.935
This is my daughter
that is blazing new trails.

46:12.603 --> 46:16.315
-If your grandparents were here...
-[Dave] Yeah.

46:16.398 --> 46:19.693
-Your grandmothers would be equally proud.
-[Dave] Oh, man.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.487
They would just be amazed.

46:21.570 --> 46:24.406
Your ma-ma,
she would have talked you to death.

46:24.490 --> 46:25.824
-She'd be giggling...
-[Catherine] Yeah.

46:25.908 --> 46:28.994
She would have been so happy.
She'd be slapping you on the knee, boy.

46:29.077 --> 46:30.829
[indistinct]

46:30.913 --> 46:35.125
[Endolyn] It is really exciting
to see Mashama be celebrated.

46:35.626 --> 46:40.088
She opened up an idea for Savannah
of what was possible here,

46:41.173 --> 46:43.967
and she's sharing that light

46:44.593 --> 46:47.012
with many men and women
who came before her,

46:47.346 --> 46:48.680
who just didn't have the chance.

46:52.100 --> 46:53.894
[Bailey] When I'm in this building,

46:54.603 --> 47:00.067
I can't help but understand
the historical impact that it holds.

47:01.568 --> 47:07.950
My family members would not have been
able to walk freely in this space,

47:09.076 --> 47:14.748
and now to be the executive chef here,
to be a partner in this restaurant,

47:15.415 --> 47:18.502
you understand
that change is willing to happen

47:18.585 --> 47:19.920
in a place like Savannah.

47:26.093 --> 47:30.597
And at the same time,
there's so much to do.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.935
I'm just getting warmed up.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.316
[upbeat music playing]
