00:02.116 --> 00:05.334
I can't believe we have been
waiting almost three hours.

00:05.335 --> 00:08.776
At this rate, they should just pass
out easter eggs and call it a twofer.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.946
I'm sorry, but who knew
so many people would want

00:11.947 --> 00:14.153
to see Santa two days before Christmas?

00:14.624 --> 00:15.985
Everyone.

00:16.660 --> 00:19.244
Yeah, well, I just wish I didn't
wait until now to get Emma's present.

00:19.575 --> 00:21.977
Who knew they'd already be sold out?

00:21.978 --> 00:23.623
Again, I'm gonna go with

00:23.624 --> 00:25.099
everyone.

00:25.506 --> 00:26.763
Now what am I gonna do?

00:26.764 --> 00:28.108
I have to get Emma that giggorilla.

00:28.109 --> 00:29.632
She loves that laughing ape.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.200
She told me so with her smile.

00:31.201 --> 00:32.577
Well, you do know there's a good chance

00:32.578 --> 00:34.221
that smile was just gas, right?

00:35.510 --> 00:36.560
You're next.

00:36.918 --> 00:40.869
If anyone feels the need to
spit up, tear up or hiccup,

00:40.870 --> 00:42.472
I'd appreciate a heads-up.

00:44.432 --> 00:46.568
Well, I'd appreciate a hurry up.

00:46.569 --> 00:48.610
Because I got a turkey I need to pick up.

00:49.094 --> 00:50.180
(Chuckles)

00:50.181 --> 00:51.835
Well, here's how it's gonna go down.

00:52.191 --> 00:54.296
He "ho-hos," you tell him what you want,

00:54.601 --> 00:55.753
we snap a picture

00:56.086 --> 00:57.860
and then, if you'd like
to make another memory,

00:57.861 --> 01:00.458
meet me in 20 minutes
in the gingerbread house.

01:05.343 --> 01:07.302
I might have to fold you in half,

01:07.303 --> 01:09.693
but I think I can get it done.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.115
Best offer I've had all week.

01:13.878 --> 01:18.439
Ho ho ho! Who is this little snowflake?

01:18.440 --> 01:20.334
- Hello there.
- This is Emma.

01:20.335 --> 01:21.899
And she's been a very good girl this year.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.564
And would love to find a
giggorilla under her tree.

01:24.565 --> 01:25.483
(Santa chuckles)

01:25.484 --> 01:27.138
Any chance you can hook a dad up?

01:27.941 --> 01:29.571
Well, toys come and go...

01:29.572 --> 01:32.832
But the spirit of Christmas, now
that's the only present worth giving.

01:33.213 --> 01:35.268
(Sighs) You could have just said no.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.801
Elf: All right.

01:36.802 --> 01:38.111
Picture time.

01:38.112 --> 01:39.275
(Cellphone ringing)

01:39.276 --> 01:40.422
(Sighs)

01:40.423 --> 01:41.509
It's your brother.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.499
What?

01:43.997 --> 01:46.746
Danny, how could you lose a ham?!

01:47.630 --> 01:49.998
Hey! Where'd you get that giggorilla?!

03:09.555 --> 03:10.413
Look...

03:10.414 --> 03:13.627
I could knee-deep in snow
bunnies and hot tuckeys right now.

03:14.730 --> 03:17.393
Tucker, we are two of the
luckiest people in the world.

03:17.394 --> 03:19.523
I mean, Mrs. Wheeler is
the queen of Christmas.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.209
Growing up, I used to look out
my window on Christmas morning,

03:22.558 --> 03:25.519
and say, "man, I wish I was a Wheeler."

03:25.983 --> 03:27.565
I mean, the rest of the year, God no.

03:27.566 --> 03:29.165
But Christmas she does right.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.057
All right, people.

03:31.058 --> 03:33.219
I would like to thank you for signing up

03:33.220 --> 03:35.150
to be Bonnie's little helpers.

03:35.694 --> 03:39.084
Now I realize I have a
couple of novices here.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.492
And I want you to know...

03:40.952 --> 03:42.874
It will not be easy.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.308
But it will be hard.

03:45.668 --> 03:47.648
The road to a perfect Christmas

03:47.649 --> 03:49.752
is paved with nutmeg, frosting...

03:50.263 --> 03:51.805
And possibly tears.

03:52.545 --> 03:54.285
Can you handle the merriment?

03:54.995 --> 03:56.066
- Um...
- Yeah, I think so...

03:56.067 --> 03:57.228
I can't hear you!

03:57.229 --> 03:58.595
Both: Yes, Mrs. Wheeler!

03:58.596 --> 04:00.023
Excellent! All right.

04:00.024 --> 04:02.112
Now what should we do first?

04:02.113 --> 04:04.080
Should we hang some garland?

04:04.551 --> 04:06.486
- Yeah.
- Yes, I love hanging garland!

04:06.487 --> 04:08.892
No no! Rookie mistake!

04:09.812 --> 04:11.235
You gotta hang the lights

04:11.236 --> 04:13.630
before you hang the garland.

04:13.631 --> 04:15.046
- (Quietly) Right.
- And before you hang,

04:15.410 --> 04:17.101
you gotta untangle.

04:17.101 --> 04:18.077
(Grunts)

04:18.079 --> 04:19.423
Here you go!

04:19.425 --> 04:21.656
I got 15 more where they came from.

04:21.656 --> 04:23.314
- (Door opens)
- Yeah.

04:23.315 --> 04:24.918
Here's everything from the storage locker.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.890
Except the blow-up nativity scene.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.392
Sorry, I might have punctured a wise man.

04:30.168 --> 04:31.875
Well, dod you at least bring up the robe?

04:31.876 --> 04:33.345
Tucker, what size are you?

04:35.498 --> 04:36.587
Oh, my God!

04:36.588 --> 04:38.281
I just got a lead on a giggorilla.

04:38.282 --> 04:39.725
A new shipment came in
at the mall. Come on.

04:39.726 --> 04:40.978
Danny, I need some crowd control.

04:40.979 --> 04:42.649
Oh, no no no! Wait wait wait wait, no!

04:42.650 --> 04:44.527
You guys have gotta get the Christmas tree.

04:44.915 --> 04:46.604
Christmas Eve is tomorrow.

04:46.605 --> 04:48.502
Sorry, mom. Ben needs me.

04:48.503 --> 04:50.345
Plus, I haven't started
my Christmas shopping yet.

04:50.346 --> 04:51.839
I'm not gonna wait till
the last minute this year.

04:53.437 --> 04:54.567
(Door closes)

04:54.568 --> 04:55.963
Well, now what am I gonna do?

04:56.574 --> 04:58.925
Ben and Danny always get the tree.

05:00.171 --> 05:02.023
Now who's gonna get the tree?

05:09.813 --> 05:11.202
Ha ha, there it is!

05:11.203 --> 05:12.328
There's only one left!

05:28.091 --> 05:29.319
No! (Groans)

05:30.108 --> 05:31.551
Now what are we gonna do?

05:31.552 --> 05:33.213
Psst. Over here.

05:36.144 --> 05:37.889
I think I can help you boys out.

05:38.247 --> 05:40.348
Oh, great. Here's my list.

05:40.349 --> 05:41.883
I was thinking of getting my mom a scarf.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.330
But that's what I got her last year.

05:44.572 --> 05:47.887
Does your beanstalk know
you left it unattended?

05:49.567 --> 05:52.492
I think I can help you
out with a giggorilla.

05:52.493 --> 05:54.778
Really? But how would you
ever get your hands on one?

05:54.779 --> 05:57.779
Well, let's just say it
fell off the back of a truck.

05:58.780 --> 06:00.505
I don't think we want a broken one.

06:01.532 --> 06:04.332
Wow, God really does divide.

06:06.190 --> 06:09.907
Just meet me out back in 20 minutes.

06:10.312 --> 06:11.522
(Exhales sharply)

06:11.523 --> 06:13.289
Oh, my God, this is so great.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.580
Yeah! We actually met an elf!

06:18.960 --> 06:20.571
(Eerie voice) Riley Perrin...

06:21.871 --> 06:24.269
Riley Perrin...

06:25.535 --> 06:28.618
I'm the ghost of turkeys past.

06:29.416 --> 06:32.130
Ignore the fact that I am naked.

06:33.068 --> 06:35.798
And stop staring at my giblets.

06:40.576 --> 06:42.233
(Normal voice) Riley, you were right.

06:42.234 --> 06:45.041

06:53.911 --> 06:55.866
Oh. Well, I would love it
if I had asked you to go out

06:55.867 --> 06:57.819
and buy a giant toilet brush.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.982
Come on, people!

07:00.983 --> 07:03.768
You signed on for the perfect Christmas.

07:04.085 --> 07:06.189
Is there anything about that tree

07:06.190 --> 07:08.521
that says "perfect Christmas"?

07:09.755 --> 07:12.074
But this little guy needed a real home.

07:12.075 --> 07:14.055
I mean, we are kindred spirits.

07:14.644 --> 07:16.450
This tree is me.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.345
That's sweet, Tuck.

Maybe Santa will bring you a wood chipper.

Ben: Hello?

07:28.526 --> 07:29.963
Anybody here?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.720
Gentlemen...

07:35.213 --> 07:37.922
I believe you were looking for this.

07:37.923 --> 07:39.435
(Laughs) Yes. Thank you.

07:39.436 --> 07:41.786
You're gonna make one special
little girl very happy.

07:41.787 --> 07:43.263
Oh! Not so fast.

07:43.264 --> 07:44.785
The going rate is 300.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.122
- Dollars?!
- No, gumdrops.

07:47.544 --> 07:48.957
Yes, dollars!

07:49.547 --> 07:51.345
There's no way I'm paying
that kind of money for this.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.434
That's extortion.

07:52.435 --> 07:55.077
Well, I guess your little girl
is not that special after all.

07:55.078 --> 07:59.184
You remember this moment when she's
headlining at "girls girls girls."

08:00.291 --> 08:02.312
Ben, don't listen to this guy.

08:02.313 --> 08:04.968
I'm beginning to think
he isn't even a real elf!

08:05.863 --> 08:08.010
Plus, I'm sure the store is
gonna get another shipment.

08:08.011 --> 08:10.081
They will. But unfortunately for you,

08:10.082 --> 08:12.050
employees get first dibs.

08:12.051 --> 08:15.598
So I guess I am your only option.

08:16.097 --> 08:17.785
Oh, I don't think so.

08:19.002 --> 08:21.472
(Festive music playing)

08:22.181 --> 08:24.333
I can't believe there
weren't any other options.

08:30.475 --> 08:33.682
Hey, remember when I said I
would do anything for Emma?

08:33.683 --> 08:34.902
When this is over,

08:34.903 --> 08:36.662
I have done everything for Emma.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.664
Hey, I've had an elf wedgie
for the last six hours,

08:40.664 --> 08:43.126
and I think these shoes are
permanently curling my toes

08:43.126 --> 08:44.794

08:46.491 --> 08:48.019

but I don't know these kids.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.307
Ben, I think Santa's trying to say that

09:48.308 --> 09:50.098
the spirit of Christmas is in your heart,

09:50.099 --> 09:51.299
not in material things.

09:52.202 --> 09:53.667
Yeah, maybe you're right.

true meaning of Christmas.

Riley, that was supposed
to be done two hours ago.

10:13.871 --> 10:15.337
Uh, Tucker, please tell me

10:15.338 --> 10:17.205
that you have finished
with the gingerbread house.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.020
Wait, what happened to the fence?

10:23.615 --> 10:25.684
(Clears throat) No idea.

10:26.879 --> 10:27.980
People!

10:27.981 --> 10:31.436
I am slaving to give you
the perfect Christmas.

10:31.771 --> 10:34.137
You're either with me or against me.

10:34.138 --> 10:35.323
And right now you're just a couple of

10:35.324 --> 10:37.799
stale nuts on my holiday fruitcake!

10:39.188 --> 10:40.894
What's wrong with that snowman?

10:40.895 --> 10:42.235
Why isn't it blinking?

10:42.236 --> 10:43.195
Oh, my gosh! (Gasps)

10:43.196 --> 10:46.728
Why does Christmas hate
me when I love it so much?!

10:51.639 --> 10:54.143
I don't think she's the
one that Christmas hates.

10:55.081 --> 10:57.207
Okay. But, Tucker, you have to
remember why she's doing this.

10:57.605 --> 10:59.977
I mean, she wants to give
us the perfect Christmas.

10:59.978 --> 11:02.957
I don't know how much
more perfect I can take.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.883
Look, I have got a
gumdrop stuck up my nose.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.417
Which may have been my own fault.

11:10.962 --> 11:11.919
(Sighs deeply)

11:11.920 --> 11:14.539
Okay, I think there's
something you need to see.

11:21.216 --> 11:22.644
(Gasps)

11:23.950 --> 11:25.928
She made us stockings?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.339
I know.

11:28.340 --> 11:29.658
And if you think this is good,

11:29.987 --> 11:32.392
wait until you see what she puts in them.

11:34.312 --> 11:35.326
All right.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.067
We are back on track.

11:37.068 --> 11:38.414
I got him blinking again.

11:38.415 --> 11:40.975
Okay, it's time to kick
the cheer into high gear.

11:40.976 --> 11:43.522
We are t-minus three
to turkey time, people.

11:43.523 --> 11:46.028
Let's get it moving. On Tucker, on Riley!

11:46.931 --> 11:48.966
We did it! In your face, Christmas!

11:50.751 --> 11:52.768
And now Emma's is gonna be perfect.

11:53.187 --> 11:56.272
Well, perfect would be if my jingle bells
didn't get caught in the subway door.

11:57.439 --> 11:59.248
They used to jingle when I walked.

12:00.227 --> 12:01.483
Which was all worth it because

12:01.484 --> 12:02.951
when Emma wakes up tomorrow,

12:02.952 --> 12:05.005
this is going to be under her tree.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.466
(Chewing loudly)

12:10.467 --> 12:12.097
I don't think she gon' like that.

12:14.796 --> 12:16.434
I gotta say... This doesn't look

12:16.435 --> 12:18.426
anything like the picture on the box.

12:20.811 --> 12:22.555
Thank you for your business.

12:22.556 --> 12:23.938
Merry Christmas.

12:23.939 --> 12:26.331
♪ Deck the halls with wads of money ♪

12:26.332 --> 12:27.689
♪ Fa LA LA LA LA LA...

12:28.238 --> 12:29.326
uh-oh.

12:30.046 --> 12:31.750
I think you've got some explaining to do.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.841
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:32.842 --> 12:34.300
I didn't put that rock in there.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.066
You're a disgrace to the tights. (Exhales)

12:37.925 --> 12:40.077
Danny, look! There's one right there!

12:40.078 --> 12:40.984
Oh, yeah!

12:41.527 --> 12:42.608
I got it!

12:42.609 --> 12:43.733
Yes! Finally!

12:43.734 --> 12:44.649
The door!

12:46.805 --> 12:47.920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

12:47.921 --> 12:49.946
Merry Christmas. (Laughing)

12:49.947 --> 12:51.769
- (Pounding on door)
- Bye-bye, boys.

12:52.076 --> 12:53.301
(Ben and Danny yelling)

12:56.753 --> 12:58.990
I am the worst father ever.

12:59.550 --> 13:01.675
I can't believe I'm sitting
in the back of a truck,

13:01.676 --> 13:03.594
- driving off to God-knows-where...
- (Giggorilla giggling)

13:03.595 --> 13:04.939
Not at home with Emma.

13:05.962 --> 13:06.997
Danny!

13:06.998 --> 13:08.278
Do you really have to do that right now?!

13:08.279 --> 13:09.977
It's been hours.

13:09.978 --> 13:11.660
I just don't see what the big deal is.

13:11.661 --> 13:12.793
It says right here on the box,

13:13.149 --> 13:15.691
"hours of fun for ages six months and up."

13:16.054 --> 13:17.287
I'm up.

13:17.288 --> 13:18.136
I'm not laughing.

13:20.665 --> 13:22.553
(Truck braking)

13:22.554 --> 13:23.729
We're stopped!

13:23.730 --> 13:25.727
- Hey! We're stuck!
- Help us! We're inside!

13:27.344 --> 13:29.531
Do you think the truck
driver will believe our story?

13:29.532 --> 13:32.072
Dude, we're elves. Of
course he'll believe us.

13:32.982 --> 13:34.646
- (Ben shouting)
- Help, please!

13:37.212 --> 13:39.482
Okay, that's the last place setting.

13:39.483 --> 13:40.623
What's next?

13:41.732 --> 13:43.089
Oh, my God.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.549
There's nothing left. That's it!

13:44.961 --> 13:46.447
It's Christmas!

13:46.448 --> 13:47.835
(Sobbing)

13:49.730 --> 13:51.408
(Inhales sharply) So beautiful.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.784
Where are those boys?

13:54.785 --> 13:56.361
If we don't eat the ham on time,

13:56.362 --> 13:57.994
it throws off the pumpkin pie.

13:57.995 --> 13:59.355
Which undoes the caroling,

13:59.356 --> 14:00.577
which upsets the chestnuts,

14:00.578 --> 14:02.110
which tips over the midnight snack.

14:02.111 --> 14:03.701
It's a house of cards, people!

14:04.445 --> 14:05.778
(Knocking on door)

14:05.779 --> 14:07.425
Mrs. Wheeler, it's fine.

14:07.426 --> 14:08.883
Christmas is here.

14:08.884 --> 14:10.952
Oh, it's not here till I say it's here.

14:13.725 --> 14:14.952
Hi!

14:15.725 --> 14:17.388
- Remember me?
- Mm.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.269
I met you yesterday.

14:19.802 --> 14:21.593
You might recall we had a brief

14:21.594 --> 14:23.458
but meaningful flirtation.

14:23.459 --> 14:24.759
(Scoffs)

14:24.760 --> 14:26.287
And as I recall,

14:26.610 --> 14:28.510
the last time I saw my boys,

14:28.511 --> 14:29.993
they were on their way to see you

14:29.994 --> 14:31.911
to return a rock.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.533
Well, that's kinda why I came to talk.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.768
We have a teensy situation.

14:36.190 --> 14:37.021
I'm assuming

14:37.022 --> 14:39.087
all your situations are teensy.

14:40.364 --> 14:41.989
It saddens me to inform you

14:42.515 --> 14:44.880
that your boys had the bad fortune

14:44.881 --> 14:47.454
of getting trapped in the back of a truck.

14:47.455 --> 14:48.741
What are you talking about?

14:48.742 --> 14:51.069
- Trapped... it's kinda like stuck...
- Yeah yeah, I got it.

14:51.070 --> 14:52.376
- ...but it's worse.
- (Mouthing)

14:53.519 --> 14:54.946
But here's the good news:

14:54.947 --> 14:56.184
I called the trucking company...

14:56.673 --> 14:58.673
perhaps not as quick as I should have,

14:58.674 --> 14:59.927
but I did.

14:59.928 --> 15:01.438
And your boys have been deposited

15:01.439 --> 15:03.202
at a bus depot in Pennsylvania.

15:03.630 --> 15:05.465
So they're on their way home now?

15:05.466 --> 15:07.245
Well, uh, I would love to say yes,

15:07.246 --> 15:08.865
but the correct answer is no.

15:10.299 --> 15:12.099
There's a blizzard.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.326
No busses coming or going.

15:15.147 --> 15:18.513
So they're missing Christmas?

15:18.514 --> 15:20.201
Yeah, that's about it.

15:20.202 --> 15:21.519
Whoo! (Chuckles)

15:21.520 --> 15:23.452
Feels good to have
gotten that off my chest.

15:25.270 --> 15:26.358
Okay!

15:26.684 --> 15:28.182
It's official.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.299
Everything is ruined!

15:30.300 --> 15:32.262
All my months of planning

15:32.263 --> 15:34.426
to give everyone the perfect Christmas,

15:34.427 --> 15:38.321
and all they care about is getting
their hands on some stupid toy.

15:38.322 --> 15:39.519
Well, you know what?

15:39.520 --> 15:40.936
I'm finished, I'm done.

15:40.937 --> 15:42.460
Pack it up, it's over!

15:42.761 --> 15:44.592
Wait, what? No no! Not done.

15:44.593 --> 15:46.162
No. I'm sorry.

15:46.163 --> 15:47.243
Christmas is over.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.589
Oh, no no no no.

15:51.590 --> 15:53.046
You listen to me, woman.

15:53.602 --> 15:55.224
You have promised me the perfect Christmas,

15:55.225 --> 15:56.678
and you're gonna give it to us.

15:56.679 --> 15:58.117
I mean, we have hung the lights

15:58.118 --> 15:59.800
and iced the cookies
and hooked the ornaments

15:59.801 --> 16:01.629
and minced the meat, roasted the chestnuts,

16:01.630 --> 16:02.952
polished the silver, strung the garland

16:03.434 --> 16:07.405
and even spent four hours
glazing your damn Christmas ham!

16:07.406 --> 16:09.447
So you are gonna give
us the perfect Christmas,

16:09.448 --> 16:11.768
or you have another thing coming, lady.

16:15.482 --> 16:16.604
Wait a minute.

16:17.753 --> 16:19.275
Where's the ham?

16:21.735 --> 16:24.299
I'm a naughty naughty elf.

16:27.097 --> 16:30.046
Sorry, bud. Still no
busses going out tonight.

16:30.047 --> 16:32.372
- (Sighs)
- But, on the bright side,

16:32.373 --> 16:35.180
I'm going out with the
ticket girl next week.

16:35.181 --> 16:36.827
If I can score in this,

16:36.828 --> 16:38.364
I can score in anything.

16:39.710 --> 16:42.227
All I wanted to do was give
Emma the perfect Christmas.

16:42.617 --> 16:44.589
And now I'm stuck two hours away from home

16:44.590 --> 16:46.852
in a bus depot in a bad velvet suit

16:46.853 --> 16:48.408
with a bunch of losers.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.505
No offense.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.036
Merry Christmas to me.

16:55.095 --> 16:56.989
Hey, is that Santa?

16:56.990 --> 16:58.362
(Exhales) Danny, for the last time,

16:58.363 --> 16:59.957
Santa doesn't...

17:00.742 --> 17:02.260
that's the guy from the store.

17:02.261 --> 17:03.543
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's him.

17:04.055 --> 17:06.479
Hey, you! Remember us?

17:06.480 --> 17:07.992
(Chuckling) Hey, boys.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.511
Where's your nasty little sidekick?

17:09.869 --> 17:11.673
- What do you mean?
- Your elf.

17:11.674 --> 17:12.807
He pulled a fast one on us.

17:12.808 --> 17:14.494
And now we can't get home for Christmas.

17:14.496 --> 17:15.984
Well, I'm sorry about that.

17:15.986 --> 17:18.363
But I'm just like you
guys tonight, you know?

17:18.364 --> 17:19.810
I'm trying to get home to the family.

17:19.811 --> 17:20.913
(Scoffs)

17:21.403 --> 17:23.294
Are you elves?

17:23.295 --> 17:24.737
Do we look like elves?

17:25.242 --> 17:27.467
Uh, yeah, we kinda do.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.245
Can you tell Santa where to find me?

17:30.586 --> 17:32.089
Look, I hate to break it to you kid,

17:32.090 --> 17:33.954
but we don't know Santa, okay?

17:38.094 --> 17:39.807
What is wrong with you?!

17:39.808 --> 17:41.438
We do know Santa!

17:42.516 --> 17:45.038
Hey, do you have your suit in that bag?

17:45.537 --> 17:46.547
Always.

17:47.772 --> 17:49.313
I bet you can't catch me.

17:49.314 --> 17:50.658
Ohh! Oooh!

17:50.659 --> 17:51.825
Ho ho ho!

17:52.581 --> 17:53.821
Hear that?

17:53.822 --> 17:55.472
I think it might be Santa.

17:55.473 --> 17:56.496
(Door opens)

17:56.497 --> 17:57.523
Ho ho ho!

17:57.831 --> 17:59.627
Merry Christmas!

17:59.628 --> 18:01.711
Santa, you found me!

18:01.712 --> 18:04.312
Yes. Well, that's the
thing about Christmas.

18:04.313 --> 18:06.877
If follows you wherever you go.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.207
(Laughing)

18:08.208 --> 18:09.641
- Whoo!
- (Giggling)

18:10.285 --> 18:11.572
Right over here.

18:12.054 --> 18:13.994
Right there. Oh!

18:14.322 --> 18:17.074
So, what would you like Santa to bring you?

18:17.479 --> 18:21.011
All I wanna do is go home and see my daddy.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.615
I miss him so much.

18:23.105 --> 18:25.985
Well, I'm sure he misses you very much too.

18:26.516 --> 18:27.511
But you know,

18:28.132 --> 18:29.800
sometimes things happen

18:30.395 --> 18:32.371
and you can't be with the people you love.

18:33.493 --> 18:34.963
Right, son?

18:41.046 --> 18:42.460
Santa's right.

18:43.775 --> 18:45.654
I know what it's like to miss someone.

18:46.884 --> 18:48.223
But I can tell you...

18:49.040 --> 18:50.863
Even though when you're not with your dad,

18:51.897 --> 18:53.840
you're right here in his heart.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:03.660 --> 19:04.848
But here.

19:06.989 --> 19:08.626
Maybe you can hug this...

19:08.627 --> 19:10.373
- Ohh!
- ...Until you get home to him.

19:11.230 --> 19:13.093
- Thank you!
- (Chuckling)

19:17.135 --> 19:18.869
You could do this for a living.

19:18.870 --> 19:20.428
(Chuckles)

19:22.559 --> 19:24.337
Merry Christmas, Ben.

19:25.423 --> 19:27.244
Merry Christmas to you too.

19:28.151 --> 19:30.680
Special delivery for the wheelers!

19:31.461 --> 19:33.165
- Emma!
- Ho ho ho, everyone!

19:33.805 --> 19:35.000
Here's your daddy.

19:35.001 --> 19:36.171
Hi!

19:36.713 --> 19:38.902
Mom, I'm so happy you're here. I'm sorry...

19:39.203 --> 19:40.641
I screwed everything up.

19:41.126 --> 19:42.622
(Sighs) I can't believe I thought a toy

19:42.623 --> 19:44.198
would make Christmas perfect.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.166
It's okay, Benji.

19:46.167 --> 19:50.026
You're not the only one who went
a little nuts this holiday season.

19:50.027 --> 19:52.220
It took seeing a cup
full of Christmas crazy

19:52.221 --> 19:54.050
for me to realize what's
really important...

19:54.733 --> 19:56.324
just being with my family.

19:57.286 --> 20:00.464
Yeah, you were a
little fa-LA-LA-looney.

20:00.465 --> 20:01.476
(Laughing)

20:01.477 --> 20:03.451
I was talking about Riley.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.904
But I don't understand
how you guys got here.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.180
The roads were all closed
because of the storm.

20:09.181 --> 20:11.058
What are you talking about?
They were totally clear.

20:11.059 --> 20:13.778
- I was going like 90. (Laughs)
- It was awesome.

20:14.369 --> 20:16.200
Wait, there aren't any
cops in here, are there?

20:17.369 --> 20:18.897
Hey, where's Santa?

20:18.898 --> 20:20.239
He's right over...

20:21.394 --> 20:23.012
huh, that's weird.

20:23.671 --> 20:25.119
He didn't even say goodbye.

20:28.231 --> 20:29.524
Don't worry.

20:29.958 --> 20:31.348
If we need him...

20:31.837 --> 20:33.934
I have a feeling he'll find us.

20:33.935 --> 20:36.288
(Chuckles) Merry Christmas, Emma.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.585
All: ♪ So have some fun

20:41.586 --> 20:42.816

20:53.631 --> 20:54.787

- Yah!

20:59.294 --> 21:00.849
I'm sorry!

21:02.642 --> 21:05.822
Well, boss, those
Wheelers were a tough one,

21:05.823 --> 21:08.578
but I think we pulled it off.

21:08.579 --> 21:10.360
So, should we go get some dinner?

21:10.361 --> 21:11.583
Oh, no need.

21:11.584 --> 21:13.496
I got us a ham.

21:13.965 --> 21:15.563
(Laughing) Ho ho ho ho!
