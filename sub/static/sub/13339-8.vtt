WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:08.542
( music playing )

00:15.649 --> 00:17.718
( Hannah laughs )

00:17.818 --> 00:20.221
OH, MY GOD.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.890
THAT IS THE CUTEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN

00:22.990 --> 00:25.126
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.760
I WAS AN AMAZING CHILD.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.830
COULD YOU FLY?

00:29.930 --> 00:31.665
COULD I WHAT?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.667
COULD YOU FLY?

00:35.836 --> 00:37.471
COULD YOU FLY?

00:37.571 --> 00:39.773
NO, I COULDN'T FLY,
BUT THEN AGAIN,

00:39.873 --> 00:42.410
I DIDN'T HAVE
EARS THAT BIG.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.747
- NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.
- ( laughing )

00:46.847 --> 00:48.782
I WAS JOKING.
I WAS JOKING.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.051
TOO BAD, 'CAUSE THIS
IS GONNA HURT YOU MORE
THAN IT DOES ME.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.654
YOU WERE
A BEAUTIFUL BABY.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.760
* Oh, run, run, run

00:59.860 --> 01:02.896
- * Yeah, it's a long
way down... *
- ( bag rustling )

01:02.996 --> 01:06.033
- * But I am closer
to the clouds... *
- ( crunching )

01:06.134 --> 01:09.503
* Up here

01:09.603 --> 01:14.342
* You can take
everything I have *

01:14.442 --> 01:16.110
* You can break
everything... *

01:16.210 --> 01:18.346
- ( Hannah moans )
- Adam: OH, GOD.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.014
- Hannah: OH, MY GOD.
- Adam: WOULD YOU HAVE
FUCKED A FOUR-YEAR-OLD ME?

01:21.115 --> 01:23.417
Hannah:
I WAS ONLY TWO.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.386
Adam:
HOW FAT WERE YOU?
BE HONEST.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.421
- ( bedsprings squeaking )
- ( Hannah moaning )

01:27.521 --> 01:29.590
- OH, MY GOD.
- Adam: THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.859
YOU WERE PROBABLY
A REALLY LATE WALKER...

01:31.959 --> 01:33.961
- OH, MY GOD.
- ...AND YOU WERE PROBABLY
TOILET TRAINED REALLY LATE.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.663
Hannah:
OH, GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

01:35.763 --> 01:40.568
- ( slams )
- * Like a skyscraper...

01:40.668 --> 01:42.736
- Hannah: OH.
- Adam: GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.373
Hannah:
OH, I'M GONNA COME.
I'M GONNA COME.

01:45.473 --> 01:48.209
ONE MORE TIME.
( moaning )

01:48.309 --> 01:50.311
Adam:
THAT WAS FAST.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.414
- Hannah: THANK YOU.
- Adam: THANK YOU.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.685
* LIKE A SKYSCRAPER.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.663
- YOU'LL FEEL IT SOON.
- I WON'T.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.666
( panting )
I TOLD YOU, OKAY,
ENDORPHINS DON'T WORK ON ME,

02:12.766 --> 02:14.968
AND ANYONE WHO'S EVER
PROMISED ME A RUNNER'S HIGH

02:15.068 --> 02:18.172
IS FULL OF BULLSHIT.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.274
- OKAY-- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.742
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- YOU GO ON WITHOUT ME.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.877
YOU JUST GOTTA REACH
YOUR THRESHOLD AND
RUN PAST IT.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.647
- COME ON, HIGH-FIVE ME.
- YOUR HANDS ARE, LIKE,
10 FEET FROM ME.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.982
SO CATCH THE FUCK UP!
HIGH-FIVE ME!

02:29.082 --> 02:30.984
- COME ON!
- I DON'T LIKE THIS, ADAM.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.521
- YES, YES.
- I HATE THIS. I HATE THIS.
I HATE THIS.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.623
FUCK, YES. I FUCKING LOVE IT.
HANNAH, YOU'RE DOING AWESOME.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.558
- I HATE THIS! WHOO!
- THAT'S GREAT.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.660
- THIS'LL CHANGE
YOUR LIFE, I SWEAR IT.
- WHOO! INTO WHAT?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.029
WHOA, PACE YOURSELF, KID.
PACE YOURSELF.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.998
WOW, NO. WOW!

02:45.098 --> 02:46.600
WHAT THE FUCK?!
GET UP.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.936
YOU'RE, LIKE, THREE BLOCKS
FROM YOUR HOUSE!

02:49.036 --> 02:51.839
YOU COULD HOP HOME.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.807
NO, GET UP!

02:53.907 --> 02:55.175
COME ON!

02:55.276 --> 02:57.445
CHARLIE'S IN THE BUSHES!

02:57.545 --> 03:00.648
CHARLIE'S IN THE BUSHES!
COME ON!

03:00.748 --> 03:02.816
( laughing )

03:02.916 --> 03:05.018
OH, MY GOD.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.087
- FUCKER. WHAT?
- LOOK.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.023
THE ICE-CREAM TRUCK
IS PARKED DIRECTLY
IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.793
- IT'S LIKE LIFE IS A DREAM.
- OH, SHIT.

03:12.893 --> 03:16.364
- WHAT?
- I DON'T DOCE CREAM.
IT'S LIKE SWEET MUCUS.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.131
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

03:18.232 --> 03:21.168
( laughing )
YES.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.671
- I MEAN, YOU CAN
HAVE SOME, THOUGH.
- DO YOU HAVE ANY CASH?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.573
LOOK AT ME-- I'M NOT EVEN
WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.008
- WHERE WOULD I PUT CASH?
- I'M NOT WEARING ANY
UNDERWEAR EITHER.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.577
- HEY.
- Man: HEY.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.645
SHE'LL SHOW YOU HER TITS
IF YOU GIVE HER
SOME ICE CREAM.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.347
- I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.
- YES, YOU WILL.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.583
- I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.
- JUST KIDDING. I HAVE $5.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.621
MM-MM.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.023
IF YOU DON'T
LIKE ICE CREAM,
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

03:43.123 --> 03:46.026
I LIKE YOU.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.095
I'M DONE WITH THESE.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.331
( shorts thud softly )

03:57.104 --> 03:58.839
( emphatically )
HELLO.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.841
- Hannah: MARN, YOU OKAY?
- OF COURSE I AM.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.943
WHAT, I CAN'T JUST, LIKE,
CATCH UP ON SOME STUFF

04:03.043 --> 04:05.579
FROM THE COMFORT OF MY OWN BED
ON A WEEKEND MORNING?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.815
OKAY, WELL,
IS IT CHARLIE STUFF?

04:07.915 --> 04:10.484
HE AND AUDREY WENT TO ROME.
THEY WENT TO FUCKING ROME.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.453
SHE HAD A WORK TRIP
TO MILAN

04:12.553 --> 04:14.588
AND THEN THEY TOOK
A COUPLE OF DAYS IN ROME.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.791
AND HE WAS MAKING
ALL THOSE WISHES AT THOSE,
LIKE, OVERRATED FOUNTAINS

04:17.891 --> 04:19.793
AND THEY TOOK A BAJILLION
PICTURES OF IT.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.261
- THIS IS YOUR
EX-BOYFRIEND?
- YES.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.796
AND YOU STILL
WANNA TAP THAT?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.432
WELL, WE WERE
SERIOUSLY INVOLVED
FOR FOUR YEARS

04:24.532 --> 04:27.368
AND I AM NOW DEALING
WITH THE DEEPLY PAINFUL FACT

04:27.468 --> 04:28.902
THAT I'M PROBABLY NOT
GONNA END UP WITH HIM.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.939
OKAY, YOU NEVER WANTED
TO END UP WITH HIM.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.442
HANNAH, DON'T MINIMIZE.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.710
- THAT SHIT'S REALLY HARD.
- SORRY.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.646
- Adam: I'M SORRY TO HEAR
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THAT.
- THANK YOU.

04:38.746 --> 04:42.115
WHEN I BROKE UP
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND
FROM COLLEGE-- SO SAD.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.885
I LOST 30 POUNDS.
I COULDN'T MOVE OR TALK

04:44.985 --> 04:47.421
OR GET MY DICK HARD,
BUT IT ALSO MADE ME GO,

04:47.521 --> 04:49.323
"HEY, WHO AM I
AND WHAT DO I WANT?"

04:49.423 --> 04:51.459
THEN I WAS LIKE, BOOM,
I KNOW WHO I AM.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.728
I WANTED TO SWITCH MAJORS
AND BUY A CIRCULAR SAW,

04:54.828 --> 04:57.297
AND I PROMISED MYSELF
THAT I'D FOLLOW MY GUT
NO MATTER WHAT.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.166
AND I'D DO WHAT
MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.034
WHAT MAKES YOU
FEEL GOOD?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.003
I LIKE...

05:03.103 --> 05:04.872
READING.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.139
( chortles )

05:06.239 --> 05:08.642
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Hannah: OH, HERE.

05:08.742 --> 05:12.012
- OKAY, WE GOTTA JET OUT.
WE GOTTA GO TO TECH.
- OKAY.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.483
YO, SKANK. WHERE YOU AT?
GETTIN' THAT PUSSY POUNDED?

05:16.316 --> 05:19.019
- IT'S MY SISTER.
- OH.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.891
NO ONE'S EVER
TAKEN ME TO THEIR
TECH REHEARSAL BEFORE.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.893
( laughs )

05:25.993 --> 05:28.696
YOU JUST SAY "TECH."

05:28.796 --> 05:30.531
SORRY THAT I DON'T
KNOW ALL THE TERMS.

05:30.631 --> 05:34.134
I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT
NERVOUS TO SEE IT, YOU KNOW?

05:34.234 --> 05:36.437
- LIKE, ARE YOU NERVOUS
TO HAVE ME SEE IT?
- NO.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.971
I'M REALLY EXCITED
FOR YOU TO SEE IT

05:38.071 --> 05:41.274
BECAUSE I'M REALLY GOOD
AT ACTING AND WRITING.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.611
PLUS, THE PLAY
COULD BE REALLY GOOD.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.217
EW.

05:50.317 --> 05:52.252
GAY.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.354
- WHAT?
- ( knocks at door )

05:54.455 --> 05:56.390
- HELLO? WHO IS IT?
- IT'S JESSA.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.659
LET ME IN.
MY THIGHS ARE ON FIRE.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.666
- ( knocking at door )
- HI.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.367
OH, MY GOD.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.671
UGH! MY THIGHS ARE
REALLY RUBBING TOGETHER
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

06:10.771 --> 06:14.775
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE RED
AND RAW AND BURNING HOT.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.478
FEELS LIKE I HAD AN EPIC
FUCKFEST WITH A GHOST.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.747
I JUST WISH I HAD
A WHEELCHAIR FOR
JUNE AND JULY.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.315
HANNAH ISN'T HERE.
SHE LEFT WITH ADAM.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.218
BUT WE HAD A PLAN.
SHE KNEW THAT I LOST MY JOB

06:25.318 --> 06:26.587
AND SHE WAS GONNA
CONSOLE ME TODAY.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.255
YEAH, WELL,
GET USED TO IT.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.558
I MEAN, SHE HASN'T REALLY
BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT
KEEPING MANY PLANS

06:30.658 --> 06:32.526
THESE DAYS,
OR REALLY ANY DAYS.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.762
ACTUALLY, SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
FLAKY ABOUT KEEPING PLANS.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.831
AND THEN, LIKE,
APOLOGIZING FOR IT LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT HER.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.967
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
WHEN SHE GETS DRESSED UP,

06:40.067 --> 06:42.803
SHE'LL, LIKE, PUT ON
A GOOD DRESS AND NICE SHOES

06:42.903 --> 06:44.438
AND THEN, LIKE,
DO HER LIPSTICK

06:44.538 --> 06:46.507
AND THEN WILL, LIKE,
LEAVE HER FOREHEAD SHINY?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.742
- YES. YEAH.
- RIGHT?

06:48.842 --> 06:50.310
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE
COME THIS FAR.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.480
- Both: WASH YOUR FOREHEAD.
- I KNOW.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.914
IT WOULD BE VERY EASY.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.549
MAYBE NOW THAT SHE HAS
THIS BOYFRIEND,

06:55.649 --> 06:57.818
SHE'LL START TAKING
BETTER CARE OF HERSELF.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.219
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT GUY?

06:59.319 --> 07:00.688
IS HE, LIKE,
A GREAT THINKER

07:00.788 --> 07:02.956
OR JUST A TOTAL
FUCKING IDIOT?

07:03.056 --> 07:04.992
I DON'T KNOW-- HE'S NOT,
LIKE, UN-NICE OR ANYTHING.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.527
HE'S JUST FUCKING WEIRD.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.161
LIKE, I WALKED
INTO THE BATHROOM
THE OTHER DAY--

07:08.261 --> 07:10.664
I KID YOU NOT,
HE WAS SITTING THERE,
TAKING A SHIT

07:10.764 --> 07:13.601
AND DRINKING MILK
AT THE SAME TIME,
AND JUST STARED AT ME.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.636
THAT KIND OF A PERSON
WOULD JUST TOTALLY MASTURBATE

07:15.736 --> 07:17.404
IN FRONT OF ANYONE
ANY DAY.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.872
EW. I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.674
I DON'T KNOW--
I JUST FEEL BAD FOR HER.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.944
SHE'S NEVER HAD
A NORMAL BOYFRIEND
THAT'S NOT GAY, YOU KNOW?

07:24.044 --> 07:27.548
I DON'T KNOW--
MAYBE SHE JUST DOESN'T
REALIZE HOW BIZARRE HE IS.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.886
YOU LOOK REALLY GORGEOUS.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.856
I LOVE YOU
ALL STRIPPED DOWN.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.092
I'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS MISERABLE IN MY LIFE.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.995
IT'S TOTALLY WORKING.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.100
NO, OKAY.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.506
IT'S MY FIRST DAY
OF THE SIXTH GRADE.

07:52.606 --> 07:56.309
MM, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO SIT.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.878
I JUST MOVED TO TOWN LAST WEEK

07:57.978 --> 07:59.747
AND I'VE SPENT EVERY DAY SINCE
EITHER READING IN MY HAMMOCK

07:59.847 --> 08:02.650
OR JERKING OFF,
WHICH I JUST LEARNED TO DO.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.084
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M THE ONLY ONE

08:04.184 --> 08:06.720
WHO KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM
THIS AWESOME TRICK.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.823
YOU JUST PULL YOUR WIENER
TILL IT'S HARD

08:09.923 --> 08:11.825
AND SUDDENLY,
IT'S A COCK.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.927
AND I KNOW EVERYONE
IN BIO CLASS IS LOOKING AT ME

08:14.027 --> 08:16.530
BECAUSE WHO ELSE IS 6'3"
WHEN THEY'RE 12 YEARS OLD?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.398
I SMELL LIKE SWEAT.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.334
I SMELL LIKE A GERBIL
AS I SIT DOWN

08:21.434 --> 08:23.637
AND TRY HARD
TO MAKE EYE CONTACT

08:23.737 --> 08:27.140
WITH SHELBY CARRUTHERS.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.385
HEY!
I LIKE YOUR PEN.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.688
DID YOU GET IT
AT THE MALL?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.522
IT'S NOT
A REGULAR PEN, RIGHT?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.725
SHE GOT UP AND MOVED
FIVE CHAIRS DOWN

08:44.825 --> 08:47.527
AND DIDN'T TALK TO ME AGAIN
FOR FIVE YEARS

08:47.628 --> 08:50.463
UNTIL JUNIOR YEAR

08:50.564 --> 08:52.499
WHEN I FUCKED HER
ON THE STRIP OF LAWN

08:52.600 --> 08:54.602
BETWEEN THE LIQUOR STORE
AND THE DOG SALON.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.938
AND THE WHOLE TIME,
I WAS SEEING THAT PEN--

08:58.038 --> 09:02.976
ITS PINK, FUZZY END
MOVING THROUGH THE AIR.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.146
"THAT'LL TEACH YOU.
THAT'LL TEACH YOU.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.950
THAT'LL TEACH YOU."

09:12.720 --> 09:14.755
I HAVEN'T FIGURED THE REST
OF THAT BIT OUT, GAVIN,

09:14.855 --> 09:17.891
SO WE CAN SKIP
TO THE CANOE PART.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.144
I HAVEN'T BEEN
ON THIS RIVER
IN A LONG TIME.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.612
( beatboxes )

09:38.712 --> 09:41.248
* YO, YO, YO, I LOVE
BOY SCOUT CAMP *

09:41.348 --> 09:43.984
* WHO SAYS WE BE GETTIN'
TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT? *

09:44.084 --> 09:45.352
( beatboxing )

09:45.452 --> 09:47.087
* I LOVE S'MO-O-ORES--

09:47.187 --> 09:49.589
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.359
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT.
- WELL, I CHANGED IT A LITTLE.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.327
IT'S AN EASY JOKE--
THE WIGGER JOKE.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.596
EVERYONE LAUGHS
AT THE WHITE GUY
DOING THE BLACK VOICE.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.701
I'M JUST TRYING TO BRING
SOME COMEDY TO IT, MAN.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.469
ALL THE STUFF
YOU'VE BEEN DOING

10:02.569 --> 10:05.105
IS LIKE REJECTION
AND DATE RAPE.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.807
REAL SHIT.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.276
GAVIN, THERE WAS A LOT
OF COMPLEX STUFF
BEING EXPRESSED

10:09.376 --> 10:11.544
IN WHAT YOU WROTE,
A LOT OF PATHOS.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.313
GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE
TO PROCESS THAT.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.283
DON'T BE AFRAID THAT
IF THEY'RE NOT LAUGHING,
THEY'RE NOT FEELING.

10:16.383 --> 10:20.053
LOOK, YOU OWE IT
TO YOURSELF TO TRY STRIPPING
THAT THING DOWN A LITTLE.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.922
MAYBE JUST ONE "YO."

10:22.022 --> 10:25.325
AND THROW SOME
OF THE LINES AWAY A LITTLE
AND LOSE THAT HAT.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.566
YOU'RE A HERO, MAN.

10:33.667 --> 10:38.205
YOU KEEP ME HONEST.
SERIOUSLY, THANK YOU.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.740
NO PROBLEM.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.309
- WE'LL WORK ON IT TOMORROW.
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.544
WHAT?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.213
I JUST DON'T THINK
THIS IS MY THING.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.949
ARE YOU FOR REAL?
WE OPEN IN TWO WEEKS.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.718
YEAH, I'M FOR REAL.
GOOD LUCK WITH IT, MAN.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.720
- YOU'RE-- YOU'RE SERIOUS?
- YEAH, I'M FUCKING SERIOUS.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.254
YOU CAN'T DO THIS
TO ME, ADAM.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.957
I INVESTED 2,000 BUCKS.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.293
I CAN'T GET THAT BACK.
YOU DIDN'T INVEST ANYTHING.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.629
YEAH, I DID-- MY TIME.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.332
AND I CAN'T GET MY TIME BACK,
SO I GUESS WE'RE EVEN.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.780
IT'S JUST, LIKE,
FUCKING PEOPLE.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.381
SHIT, I MET HIM.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.183
HE TELLS ME HE'S DOWN
TO DO ONE KIND OF THING

11:23.283 --> 11:24.852
AND IT'S ANOTHER
KIND OF FUCKING THING.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.186
IF I KNEW HE WAS
GONNA BUST OUT

11:26.286 --> 11:28.388
THAT "YO, YO, YO" SHIT,
I WOULD'VE STAYED HOME.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.890
I REALLY LIKED
YOUR MONOLOGUE.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.725
LIKE, MAYBE YOU COULD
USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.493
ANYWAY, IT'S FOR THE BEST.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.929
I NEED TO FOCUS
ON BUILDING MY BOAT.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.198
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T
ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT
ON THE FIRST TRY.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.433
LIKE, YOU HAVE TO TEACH THEM
HOW TO PLEASE YOU

11:40.533 --> 11:42.035
OR YOU HAVE
TO COMPROMISE.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.971
NOT IN YOUR ART.
THAT SHOULDN'T BE
A COMPROMISE.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.006
- ( tires screech )
- ( horn honks )

11:46.106 --> 11:47.808
WOULD YOU FUCKING
WATCH IT?!

11:47.908 --> 11:49.509
I'M WALKING
WITH A FUCKING WOMAN!

11:49.609 --> 11:51.044
CAN YOU SEE THAT? HUH?

11:51.144 --> 11:53.380
YOU WANNA HIT A FUCKING WOMAN
WITH YOUR FUCKING CAR,

11:53.480 --> 11:57.017
YOU FUCKING CUNT-SATCHEL?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.819
FUCK YOU!

12:01.188 --> 12:02.990
OH, MY GOD.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.258
ADAM!

12:05.358 --> 12:08.228
- SHE'S GOT
NOTHING ON YOU.
- MM.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.031
REALLY, AND IT MAKES ME
QUESTION HIS TASTE

12:11.131 --> 12:14.101
BECAUSE YOU ARE A STRIKING
AND CLASSIC BEAUTY

12:14.201 --> 12:15.702
IN THE VEIN
OF BROOKE SHIELDS.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.905
JESSA, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.107
- DO WHAT?
- THIS.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.741
LIKE, PRETENDING
WE'RE FRIENDS.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.643
I REALLY CAN'T HANDLE
BEING MOCKED RIGHT NOW.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.546
- ARE YOU SERIOUS, MARNIE?
- WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR SIX YEARS;

12:26.646 --> 12:28.181
YOU'VE KNOWN MY NAME
FOR THREE.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.316
I CARE FOR YOU.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.418
I DO.
I REALLY DO.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.719
AND IF YOU DON'T
SEE THAT,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.254
THEN THAT'S A FAILING
ON MY PART

12:34.354 --> 12:36.389
BECAUSE I REALLY ADMIRE
YOUR WORK ETHIC,

12:36.489 --> 12:38.625
YOUR COMMITMENT
TO HYGIENE.

12:38.725 --> 12:42.162
I THINK YOU ARE SMART
AND KIND AND--

12:42.262 --> 12:44.064
UPTIGHT.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.332
A BIT, YES.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.134
THAT ISN'T FUN FOR ME.
DO YOU REALIZE THAT?

12:47.234 --> 12:50.137
BEING THE UPTIGHT GIRL?
I HATE IT.

12:50.237 --> 12:53.473
CHARLIE HAD TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE TO GO
TO ROME WITH.

12:53.573 --> 12:57.144
NO ONE EVER ASKS ME
TO GET, LIKE, FRIENDSHIP
TATTOOS OR WHATEVER.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.712
SOMETIMES BEING
INSIDE MY OWN HEAD

12:59.813 --> 13:04.051
IS SO EXHAUSTING THAT
IT MAKES ME WANNA CRY.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.520
SO THEN GET OUT OF THERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.557
FUCKER!

13:10.657 --> 13:14.127
- LET'S NOT GO OUTSIDE
AGAIN TODAY, OKAY?
- MM-HMM, YEAH.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.729
IT SEEMS BETTER
WHEN WE DON'T GO OUTSIDE.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.832
SO...

13:20.667 --> 13:22.469
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO NOW?

13:22.569 --> 13:25.572
UM, TAKE A SHOWER.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.964
( screams )

13:52.699 --> 13:54.868
SORRY, YOU REALLY
SCARED ME, ADAM.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.104
NO, THANK YOU.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.344
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.052
- IT'S FOR YOUR SPLIT ENDS.
- THANK YOU.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.528
( snickering )

14:21.628 --> 14:24.264
- ( urinating )
- WHAT?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.235
OH, MY GOD!

14:28.335 --> 14:30.303
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE PEEING ON ME!

14:30.403 --> 14:33.206
- OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD, STOP IT!
- ( Adam laughing )

14:33.306 --> 14:35.575
YOU'RE STILL DOING IT!
STOP IT!

14:35.675 --> 14:37.644
- CHILL, KID.
IT'S JUST PEE.
- IT'S GROSS.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.112
IT'S NOT FUNNY,
SO STOP LAUGHING.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.481
- IT'S GROSS!
- URINE IS STERILE.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.283
A LOT OF PEOPLE URINATE
ON WOUNDS TO HEAL THEM.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.019
REALLY?
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.090
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
TO GET OUT NOW.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.459
- THERE'S PEE ON YOU.
- ( screams )

14:52.559 --> 14:55.595
- Jessa: SO YOU
WERE HOW OLD?
- I WAS 14.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.198
OH, MY GOD.
TO WHO, YOUR COUSIN?

14:58.298 --> 14:59.499
MM-MM.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.035
TO MY BOYFRIEND JARED.
WE HAD BEEN DATING FOR A YEAR.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.104
- AND YOU WERE 14?
- YEAH.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.772
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST FELT READY.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.540
PLANNED THE WHOLE THING,
OBVIOUSLY.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.742
WE WERE AT HIS LAKE HOUSE.
THERE WERE CANDLES EVERYWHERE.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.045
I PUT A TOWEL
DOWN ON THE BED.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.381
AND I GUESS
ONCE I HAD DONE IT,

15:14.481 --> 15:18.151
I JUST FELT LIKE I DIDN'T
NEED TO TRY IT AGAIN FOR,
LIKE, A VERY LONG TIME.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.920
- WHY? HOW OLD WERE YOU?
- I WAS 17.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.890
- YOU WERE 17?
YOU WERE OLDER THAN ME?
- YEAH.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.692
I DIDN'T GROW BREASTS
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

15:25.792 --> 15:27.327
AND SEX WITHOUT
BREASTS IS CREEPY.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.162
THAT'S WHAT I KEEP
TRYING TO TELL HANNAH.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.530
( laughs )
THAT'S TRUE.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.533
- HER BREASTS ARE TEENSY.
- THEY'RE TEENSY.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.835
- YEAH.
- BUT I LOVE THEM.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.337
DID YOU ORDER THOSE?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.539
- I DIDN'T, NO.
- Bartender: THEY'RE FROM HIM.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.574
GRAY SUIT.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.377
OH, FABULOUS. HI.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.051
OH, NEVER MIND.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.986
OH, COME ON,
HE'S SO CUTE.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.854
THIS IS EXCITING,
BEING HIT ON.

15:54.954 --> 15:59.092
- Jessa: UGH.
- Marnie: HE LOOKS
LIKE HE'S A BOSS.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.634
Adam:
YOU LOOK GOOD
IN THE SUIT.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.472
- YOU MEAN LIKE A GIANT BABY?
- NO. PRETTY.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.474
IT'S COMFY, RIGHT?

16:14.574 --> 16:16.643
THERE'S LIKE THIS WEIRD SLIT
DOWN THE WHOLE CROTCH.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.079
YEAH, SO YOU CAN
PEE OUT OF IT.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.719
I REALLY FUCKING THOUGHT
YOU'D LAUGH.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.056
- WELL, I DIDN'T.
- WELL, I'M SORRY YOU DON'T
GET WHAT'S SO HYSTERICAL

16:29.156 --> 16:30.257
ABOUT ME PEEING ON YOU.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.759
OKAY, YOU ARE NOT
A GOOD APOLOGIZER.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.527
JUST F.Y.I.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.097
ALL RIGHT, I WON'T BUG YOU
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO READ.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.133
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ANY MORE ABOUT THE PLAY?

16:40.233 --> 16:42.402
WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.337
JUST THAT YOU WERE
SO EXCITED ABOUT IT
THIS MORNING.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.906
- AND THEN WE GOT THERE--
- IT SUCKED, YEAH.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.875
SHIT HAPPENS
LIKE THAT SOMETIMES.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.312
SO THEN MAYBE YOU NEED
TO SPEND ANOTHER WEEK
WORKSHOPPING IT.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.781
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
BASIC TRUTHS TO HIM.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.050
IT'S TOO DRAINING.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.088
OKAY, BUT I GET WHY
YOU WON'T LET HIM DO IT
WITH A DIFFERENT ACTOR.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.123
BECAUSE MY NAME'S ON IT.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.425
BUT THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A WRITING CREDIT.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.461
I WOULD RATHER DO NOTHING
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE

17:08.560 --> 17:11.397
THAN HAVE MY NAME ATTACHED
TO SOMETHING MEDIOCRE.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.666
YOUR INTEGRITY'S
ALL THAT MATTERS.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.770
- IT'S A STUPID PLAY.
- NOT A STUPID PLAY.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.705
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.474
WHEN I WAS WATCHING IT,
I WAS SO EXCITED BECAUSE
IT WAS SO, SO GOOD.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.511
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT FAKE SHIT
GAVIN WAS DOING?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.512
I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T WATCHING GAVIN.
I WAS WATCHING YOU.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.415
DO YOU KNOW
HOW UNUSUAL IT IS

17:28.515 --> 17:30.317
TO SEE SOMEONE DOING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

17:30.417 --> 17:33.453
LIKE, WHAT YOU WERE DOING,
OKAY, THAT'S SO OPEN AND HONEST

17:33.553 --> 17:36.756
AND WEIRD AND YOU'RE NOT
MAKING FUN OF THEM
IN YOUR MIND--

17:36.856 --> 17:40.160
IT MADE ME WANT
TO GO AND MEET YOU
WHEN YOU WERE 15 AND KISS YOU.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.071
I THINK I'LL LET GAVIN
DO THE PLAY.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.574
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.609
I'LL CHANGE MY NAME.
I'LL USE A PSEUDONYM.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.679
- WHAT'S YOUR PSEUDONYM?
- FUCKIN' BEN FRANKLIN.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.949
I'LL CHANGE MY NAME,
BUT HE HAS TO TAKE OUT
SOME OF MY FAVORITE LINES.

18:03.049 --> 18:06.319
THAT'S A GOOD
COMPROMISE, RIGHT?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.225
YEAH, I JUST FEEL LIKE
I TRAVEL SO MUCH NOW,

18:12.325 --> 18:14.194
I'M, LIKE-- I'M LAG-PROOF.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.862
- YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE--
- WOW.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.096
LIKE, I'M RESISTANT
TO JET LAG.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.798
THAT'S INSPIRING.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.668
I TOOK THE MOST AMAZING
MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES CLASS...

18:21.768 --> 18:23.570
- LOVE THE MIDDLE EAST, YEAH.
- ...WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.037
AND I ALMOST BECAME
AN INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS MAJOR.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.839
- OH.
- ALMOST.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.275
( laughs )

18:28.375 --> 18:30.810
- THIS HAS BEEN GREAT,
HASN'T IT?
- MM.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.279
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE,

18:32.379 --> 18:34.847
JUST SHARING
A BEVERAGE WITH JENNA

18:34.947 --> 18:36.816
- AND MARNIE.
- Marnie: YES.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.117
- GREAT NAMES.
- THANK YOU.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.454
WELL, THANKS FOR
HANDLING THE CHECK.

18:41.554 --> 18:45.225
MM, YOU GOT IT.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.694
HEY, I HAVE A SUGGESTION.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.496
I LIVE, LIKE, A BLOCK AWAY

18:49.596 --> 18:51.398
AND I JUST MOVED
INTO BROOKLYN LAST WEEK.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.467
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
AND I HAVE BEEN SAVING

18:54.567 --> 18:57.937
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOTTLE
OF RED WINE FOR A RAINY DAY.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.972
OR A RAINY NIGHT.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.941
OR RAINY NIGHT.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.276
THE WEATHER'S FINE.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.246
UM, WELL, WE SHOULD
WELCOME YOU

19:06.346 --> 19:07.747
TO OUR BOROUGH,
FIRST OF ALL.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.383
- THANK YOU.
- AND I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.919
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO DO
SOMETHING "UNCOOL."

19:13.019 --> 19:14.821
I'D RATHER
DO A COOL THING.

19:14.921 --> 19:19.158
- SHE'S A FIRECRACKER,
THIS ONE.
- Marnie: I KNOW.

19:19.259 --> 19:22.094
BUT, YEAH,
WE'D LOVE TO GO.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.731
GREAT. DONE.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.235
I'M JUST GONNA RUN
TO THE LITTLE BOYS' ROOM,
AND THEN WE'LL MOSEY?

19:28.335 --> 19:30.737
- WE'LL MOSEY.
- OKAY.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.774
HE'S CUTE.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.443
IS HE, THOUGH?

19:36.543 --> 19:39.145
HIS FACE IS SORT OF
VERY CEREAL-BOXY.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.080
IT'S A PERFECT SQUARE.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.015
NO, I THINK HE'S HOT.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.485
AND WHAT HE DOES
IS SO INTERESTING.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.754
WHAT IS A VENTURE
CAPITALIST?

19:47.854 --> 19:51.023
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME SORT
OF EXPLORER, BUT THAT
CAN'T BE THE CASE.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.159
I LIKE HIM.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.229
AND I LIKE THIS DRINK.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.833
AND I LIKE YOU, JESSA.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.736
( music playing )

20:03.836 --> 20:06.138
* Now the funny glare
to pay a gleaming tare *

20:06.239 --> 20:08.074
- * In a staring
under heat... *
- ( children laughing )

20:08.174 --> 20:09.809
Man:
I'VE JUST BEEN DOING IT,
LIKE, THREE OR FOUR MONTHS.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.811
STARTED WITH AN EPISODE
OF "ENTOURAGE."

20:11.911 --> 20:13.280
ISN'T IT COOL?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.515
I CALL THIS ONE
"FIELD NICE,"

20:15.615 --> 20:18.718
LIKE FIELD MICE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, HAPPY.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.220
THOMAS-JOHN DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET SELF-CONSCIOUS

20:21.321 --> 20:22.922
WHILE YOU WERE
TAKING A PISS,

20:23.022 --> 20:25.858
SO HE STARTED SPINNING.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.628
I KNOW HOW SELF-CONSCIOUS
YOU GALS GET WHEN YOU'RE
TAKING A TINKLE.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.662
TOOK CARE OF IT.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.798
HE'S WORKING
ON A MASH-UPS ALBUM.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.500
MASH-UP!

20:33.600 --> 20:35.602
HE'S MIXED
"STEAL MY SUNSHINE" BY LEN...

20:35.702 --> 20:39.639
- RIGHT.
- ...AND FIELD RECORDINGS
OF CHILDREN PLAYING.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.108
THEY'RE CHILDREN
PLAYING IN A FIELD.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.243
SOUNDS, UH, AWESOME.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.313
I MEAN, IT'S A HOBBY.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.281
I'M NOT CLAIMING,
LIKE, I'M THE BEST,

20:48.381 --> 20:51.518
BUT I FUCKING
ENJOY MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.753
- CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE, PLEASE?
- YEAH.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.289
( British accent )
"PLEASE, SIR, CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE?"

20:56.389 --> 20:59.125
( snickers, laughing )

20:59.225 --> 21:00.527
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.995
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
I DID "OLIVER TWIST."

21:03.095 --> 21:04.263
YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT?

21:04.364 --> 21:06.333
IT'S ENGLISH.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.439
OH, THIS IS MY...
NEW ONE.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.574
- ( music playing )
- ( monkey gibbering )

21:14.674 --> 21:17.477
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
ACTUALLY JUST TWO TUNES

21:17.577 --> 21:20.012
PLAYING SIMULTANEOUSLY

21:20.112 --> 21:23.516
IN DIFFERENT
iTUNE WINDOWS,

21:23.616 --> 21:27.286
SO I DON'T HAVE TO--
HERE, I CAN JOIN YOU.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.423
HERE I AM.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.625
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU

21:32.725 --> 21:35.227
YOU LOOK LIKE
A YOUNG BROOKE SHIELDS?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.135

21:45.137 --> 21:47.340
UH, YEAH,

GOOD REFERENCE.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.111
- EH?

YEAH, TOTALLY, TOTALLY.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.347
OH, FUCK, IT'S SO RARE

21:54.447 --> 21:59.552
TO FIND JUST
TWO SUCH DIFFERENT,

21:59.652 --> 22:05.224
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
EQUAL BEAUTIES--

22:05.324 --> 22:07.794
OKAY, THAT'S OUR CUE TO GO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH--

22:07.894 --> 22:10.430
- NO, NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO GO.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.632
( stammers )
WE'VE OUTSTAYED OUR WELCOME.

22:12.732 --> 22:15.301
- NO.

YOU'VE BEEN SO--

22:15.402 --> 22:18.270
* Slave to love...

22:18.371 --> 22:21.173
( monkey gibbering )

22:21.273 --> 22:24.744
* Slave to love...

22:30.950 --> 22:32.552
YIKES.

22:32.652 --> 22:36.355
JUST FOLLOW
YOUR INSTINCTS, BROOKE.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.258
* We're
the restless-hearted *

22:39.358 --> 22:43.129
* Not the chained
and bound *

22:43.229 --> 22:46.533
* The sky is burning

22:46.633 --> 22:49.268
* A sea of flame

22:49.368 --> 22:52.271
* Though your world
is changing *

22:52.371 --> 22:54.206
* I will be the same

22:54.306 --> 22:56.743
* Slave to love

23:00.312 --> 23:02.849
* Slave to love...

23:02.949 --> 23:06.553
( monkeys gibbering )

23:06.653 --> 23:09.088
* Slave to love...

23:09.188 --> 23:10.122
OH!

23:10.222 --> 23:12.592
WHOA. OH, NO.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.161
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?

23:15.261 --> 23:17.163
- DO YOU HAVE,
LIKE, A PAPER TOWEL?
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?

23:17.263 --> 23:18.898
LIKE, SOME SELTZER WATER?

23:18.998 --> 23:20.433
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!

23:20.533 --> 23:23.836
THIS IS-- THIS IS
A $10,000 RUG.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.138
THIS IS A VERY
FUCKING EXPENSIVE RUG.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.406
IF YOU'RE GONNA
SPILL ON IT,

23:27.507 --> 23:28.841
YOU GOTTA LOOK
MORE SORRY THAN THAT!

23:28.941 --> 23:30.710
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- SHE'S SORRY.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.845
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF YOU'RE REALLY SORRY,

23:32.945 --> 23:36.449
YOU'D BETTER BE PLANNING
TO MAKE THIS A VERY SPECIAL
NIGHT FOR ALL OF US,

23:36.549 --> 23:39.218
NOT JUST YOU
AND FUCKING MISSY MALOOL.

23:39.318 --> 23:40.987
ALL OF US.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.557
AND NOT ME JUST WATCHING
YOU GIRLS GO AT IT
FOR A LITTLE BIT

23:44.657 --> 23:46.358
AND GETTING
A LITTLE BIT TURNED ON.

23:46.459 --> 23:49.596
I WANNA BE BALLS-DEEP
IN SOMETHING!

23:49.696 --> 23:52.231
AND I DON'T EVEN
FUCKING CARE WHAT IT IS.

23:52.331 --> 23:55.167
NO MORE EXCLUDING ME,
MARY POPPINS!

23:55.267 --> 23:58.471
IT'S NOT FAIR.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.039
I WANNA BE PART
OF THE GROUP.

24:00.139 --> 24:04.611
OH, THAT...
WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

24:04.711 --> 24:05.978
JESSA.

24:09.348 --> 24:12.451
THIS ISN'T RIGHT, IS IT?

24:12.552 --> 24:15.354
THIS CAN'T BE THE WAY
THAT THIS GOES.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.791
- I'M-- I'M NOT GAY.
- SHE'S SO NOT GAY.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.694
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE FREE.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.098
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK HARD?

24:26.198 --> 24:28.901
NO. TELL US.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.771
I'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE

24:31.871 --> 24:34.907
MY WHOLE LIFE
TO SUCCEED.

24:35.007 --> 24:40.580
DADDY DIDN'T BUY ME THIS RUG
OR THIS APARTMENT OR THIS NOSE.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.281
THAT'S NOT YOUR NOSE.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.816
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT'S YOUR FUCKIN' NOSE.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.018
THERE IS NO CARTILAGE
IN THE WORLD THAT EXQUISITE!

24:46.118 --> 24:49.321
SO IT KIND OF TICKS ME OFF
WHEN I COME TO WILLIAMSBURG

24:49.421 --> 24:53.826
AFTER WORKING HARD
ALL FUCKING DAY IN
THE "REAL WORLD,"

24:53.926 --> 24:56.563
AND I SEE ALL THESE
STUPID LITTLE DADDY'S GIRLS

24:56.663 --> 24:58.164
WITH THEIR FUCKIN'

24:58.264 --> 25:00.733
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WEARING
A FUCKING BOWLER HAT, STUPID?

25:00.833 --> 25:04.470
AND THEN YOU COME OVER

25:04.571 --> 25:06.939
AND FLIRT AND FLIRT

25:07.039 --> 25:09.742
AND LISTEN TO MY AMAZING TUNES,
DRINK MY BEAUTIFUL WINE,

25:09.842 --> 25:12.511
AND THEN SPILL IT
ALL OVER MY GORGEOUS RUG...

25:12.612 --> 25:14.113
AND LAUGH ABOUT IT.

25:14.213 --> 25:18.384
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE NOT
LAUGHING AT YOUR RUG,
TRUST ME.

25:18.484 --> 25:21.588
- WE'RE NOT LAUGHING.
YOU-- DON'T HURT US.
- COME HERE.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.156
Jessa:
WE'RE LAUGHING
AT YOUR MASH-INS.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.226
IT'S MASH-UPS!

25:31.864 --> 25:33.933
OH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

25:34.033 --> 25:37.203
I'M GONNA GO EAT HER CUNT
ON THE SIDEWALK RIGHT NOW.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.108
( door closes )

25:42.208 --> 25:44.577
IT'S MASH-UPS.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.849

25:53.519 --> 25:56.956
Adam:
HEY. HEY!

25:58.124 --> 26:00.893
COME WITH ME, KID.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.966

26:09.501 --> 26:13.172
- ( distant siren blaring )
- THIS IS LIKE WHEN MY PARENTS
WOKE ME UP DURING A TORNADO.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.774
Adam:
JUST A LITTLE FARTHER.

26:14.874 --> 26:18.745
ADAM, I'M TIRED
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

26:20.747 --> 26:24.684
- Adam: SORRY I YELLED
AT THAT CAR.
- WHAT?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.786
I WISH I COULD APOLOGIZE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW THE DRIVER,

26:26.886 --> 26:30.222
SO I GUESS I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT IT FOREVER

26:30.322 --> 26:32.692
UNLESS HE DRIVES BY AGAIN.

26:43.502 --> 26:46.105
