CONFIRM NOR DENY, WHAT MAKES YOU

28:37.880 --> 28:38.938
THINK I WOULD SHARE THE DETAILS

28:38.940 --> 28:40.840
OF OUR SESSION WITH HIM?

28:40.850 --> 28:42.715
THATS FOR YOU TO DO.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.187
ALTHOUGH, I DO HOPE THAT

28:44.190 --> 28:45.214
YOU SHARED YOUR CONFLICT

28:45.220 --> 28:47.188
WITH YOUR FIANCEE.

28:57.200 --> 29:01.204
>> DR. WOLPER.

29:01.210 --> 29:06.068

29:06.070 --> 29:07.833
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.728
>> DAMN RIGHT YOU DO.

29:09.740 --> 29:12.470
>> I MEANT TO YOU, SEAN.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.744
I WAS COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL,

29:14.750 --> 29:16.479
MY REVEALING WHAT I DID ABOUT

29:16.480 --> 29:18.118
CHRISTIAN. AND I PUT YOU

29:18.120 --> 29:19.473
IN A TERRIBLE POSITION,

29:19.480 --> 29:20.174
AND IM SORRY.

29:20.180 --> 29:21.488
>> I KNOW. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN

29:21.490 --> 29:22.229
THAT TO CHRISTIAN--

29:22.230 --> 29:24.050
>> HOLD ON, SEAN. ITS ONE THING

29:24.060 --> 29:25.129
TO SLIP UP, ITS ANOTHER

29:25.130 --> 29:26.882
TO LIE ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.881
>> SO YOURE DENYING THAT YOU

29:28.890 --> 29:31.768
EVER HAD FEELINGS FOR SEAN?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.499
>> I NEVER SAID I WAS GAY,

29:33.500 --> 29:34.762
AND I NEVER SAID I WANTED

29:34.770 --> 29:35.964
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

29:35.970 --> 29:37.767
I NEVER SAID THOSE WORDS.

29:37.770 --> 29:38.964
>> OH, CHRISTIAN, WHEN PEOPLE

29:38.970 --> 29:41.871
COME TO ME, THEY DO SO BECAUSE

29:41.880 --> 29:43.245
THEY DONT HAVE THE WORDS

29:43.250 --> 29:44.877
TO EXPRESS HOW THEY FEEL.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.108
ITS MY JOB TO MAP OUT THOSE

29:46.110 --> 29:47.998
EMOTIONS, TO INTERPRET THEIR

29:48.010 --> 29:49.238
DESIRES.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.501
>> DESIRES?

29:50.510 --> 29:52.057
>> THE DREAM THAT YOU HAD WHERE

29:52.060 --> 29:53.812
YOU AND SEAN WERE LOVERS?

29:53.820 --> 29:55.253
>> [SIGHS]

29:55.260 --> 29:56.249

29:57.260 --> 29:58.454
HER CRAP, ARE YOU?

29:58.460 --> 29:59.484
>> IF ITS NOT TRUE, WHY ARE YOU

29:59.490 --> 30:00.514
SO UPSET?

30:00.520 --> 30:01.794
>> LOOK, YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL

30:01.800 --> 30:02.824
WITH IN YOUR LIFE WITHOUT TAKING

30:02.830 --> 30:03.922
ADVICE FROM SOME PSYCHOTIC.

30:03.930 --> 30:05.022
>> SEAN, WOULD YOU EXCUSE

30:05.030 --> 30:07.123
CHRISTIAN AND ME? I THINK I

30:07.130 --> 30:08.267
COULD CALM HIM DOWN.

30:08.270 --> 30:10.522
>> NO, NO, NO. SINCE WERE

30:10.530 --> 30:14.273
SPILLING SECRETS, DID YOU TELL

30:14.280 --> 30:18.273
SEAN ABOUT YOUR TATTOO?

30:18.280 --> 30:20.134
>> 2 WRONGS WONT MAKE

30:20.140 --> 30:22.017
A RIGHT, CHRISTIAN.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.487
>> DR. FAITH WOLPER IS

30:23.490 --> 30:25.287
A SEXUAL COMPULSIVE, SEAN.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.508
AFTER I NAILED HER IN THIS

30:27.520 --> 30:29.181
OFFICE AND THEN REMOVED

30:29.190 --> 30:30.953
HER TATTOO, WHICH SAID "PROPERTY

30:30.960 --> 30:32.552
OF MARCO," SHE THOUGHT

30:32.560 --> 30:34.027
I HAD THE HOTS FOR HER.

30:34.030 --> 30:37.090
DIDNT YOU, DOC?

30:37.100 --> 30:39.159
> > YOURE LYING.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.149
>> IF YOU WANTED ME TO BEND YOU

30:40.160 --> 30:41.263
OVER THE DESK AGAIN, WHY DIDNT

30:41.270 --> 30:42.931
YOU JUST ASK?

30:42.940 --> 30:44.032
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO INVOLVE

30:44.040 --> 30:47.134
MY PARTNER?

30:47.140 --> 30:49.961
UNLESS, OF COURSE...

30:49.970 --> 30:53.315
YOU WANT TO DO US BOTH.

30:53.320 --> 30:57.575
>> STOP.

30:57.580 --> 30:58.569
>> HEY!

30:58.580 --> 30:59.842
>> NO, LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT

30:59.850 --> 31:02.182
SHES REALLY ABOUT, SEAN. HUH?

31:06.530 --> 31:09.249

31:09.260 --> 31:10.852
I HOPE YOU DIDNT PAY

31:10.860 --> 31:13.033
FOR ANY SESSIONS IN ADVANCE.

31:23.550 --> 31:27.270

32:06.220 --> 32:07.915
>> WELL, WE ALL EVENTUALLY

32:07.920 --> 32:11.526
HAVE TO FACE A HIGHER POWER.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.157
SOME ARE A BIT MORE BRUTAL

32:13.160 --> 32:15.219
