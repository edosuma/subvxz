WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.295
Who's this?

00:03.586 --> 00:05.088
Louisa Raposa, their spokesperson.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.966
Two sets of doctors
said our illness had nothing to do with Iraq.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.094
One hired by Battle Support,
one by the Pentagon.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.596
- Welcome to Canada.
- Thank you.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.265
So we spent a week loading out
these bombed out buildings,

00:15.474 --> 00:18.060
even the dirt under them,
into these big biohazard barrels.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.061
What was in the buildings?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.688
Iraqi military supplies.
They wouldn't tell us more.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.982
Now ten of us
are fucking dying.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.484
They weren't exposed to anything.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.361
They were using
state-of-the-art hazmat gear.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.695
- There's no tank?
- No.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.490
Why wouldn't they send a tank?
I mean, maybe that's what infected them.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.866
This is the military.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.160
The air tanks are collecting
the workers' moisture.

00:35.577 --> 00:36.995
It's about the water.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.289
From a big machine
on the back of a truck.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.375
It was called something
funny, it was like...

00:41.375 --> 00:42.292
a Reimer.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.669
I have a dozen sick people,

00:44.086 --> 00:47.589
and a team of scientists who say that
the most probable cause is a Reimer.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.177
I've been offered a senior position
in another lab.

00:52.886 --> 00:53.595
Oh.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.098
That's... that's great, Bob.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.266
I'm leaving, Jill.

00:57.683 --> 00:58.183
Bye.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.978
I think I see
where Jill went wrong.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.564
Well, listen, if she calls,
don't tell her anything.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.400
But this is my last day.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.076 --> 02:41.078
1x10 - The Source

03:11.567 --> 03:13.485
That was Jersey,
I'll pay you back.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.070
Oh, don't worry about it.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.575
It's too bad
you don't play the flute.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.288
So, who were you talking to?

03:24.580 --> 03:25.873
My husband.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.672
- Are you... happily married?
- Very.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.177
Good. Lucky... lucky guy.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.390
You pussy. It was my mother.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.976
Don't do that.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.062
Come over here, you.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.397
Ooh, aye-aye-aye.

04:02.868 --> 04:03.702
Hey!

04:04.578 --> 04:07.581
Any word from Jill and Carlos on
the SACS outbreak?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.584
Their plan landed in Campeche,
they're on the way to a temporary lab.

04:10.876 --> 04:11.502
Good.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.300
- Did somebody's gerbil die?
- Bob.

04:18.966 --> 04:19.801
Bob had a gerbil?

04:19.885 --> 04:21.470
- Bob's not here.
- His stuff's gone.

04:23.096 --> 04:23.972
Well, he actually left?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.474
Well, he's gone, David.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.101
No. Guys with Asperger's,
they can barely change their socks,

04:28.185 --> 04:30.395
let alone their jobs,
so there's no way... I'll call him.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.777
That's a nice shirt, but...

04:46.161 --> 04:48.080
- Ah, his phone must have...
- Call him at home.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.999
He doesn't have a home phone. Gamelan
chews it when it rings or something.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.793
From Washington, the Reimer.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.379
Oh, looks like you're going
to need a new biochemist, David.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.965
You know, we do have
2 other biochemists.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.300
- Yeah, but not Bob!
- With Jill and Carlos in Mexico,

05:00.300 --> 05:01.385
we're already short-staffed.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.388
Don't worry, okay.
Bob is like a homing pigeon,

05:04.471 --> 05:06.890
he always comes back...
I didn't mean it to sound that way.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.684
You know what?
I'm going to go to my office, now.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.769
I'll just leave that here.
He'll be back, he'll be back.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.980
Caroline, where would you like me
to set this up?

05:13.063 --> 05:13.772
Over here.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.966
Ooh, that's Doctor Valada.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.468
In the...

06:24.801 --> 06:26.470
In the truck. Shit!

06:48.367 --> 06:50.369
He said that they took him
to another hospital

06:50.577 --> 06:51.995
because there's no blood left here.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.789
Jesus! Hi.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.291
Carlos Serrano...

06:56.667 --> 06:59.169
- Oh, Alejandro Malavilla.
- Holà Alejandro, mucho gusto.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.379
Jill Langston.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.390
I'm just going to check and
make sure his stuff's not all broken.

07:11.598 --> 07:11.890
Okay.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.270
Beavers have no exterior sexual organs,

07:16.478 --> 07:18.063
but they do have castor oil glands,

07:18.272 --> 07:20.399
which is where
many perfumes get their scent.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.569
People in the Middle Ages
thought that these glands were testicles

07:23.777 --> 07:26.196
and that when the beaver was
being chassed by hunters,

07:26.280 --> 07:27.197
in order to escape,

07:27.281 --> 07:30.200
it would bite off its own testicles
and throw them at the hunters.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.578
Castor, castrate, get it?

07:32.870 --> 07:34.663
Yeah. Tell you what, Bob you, huh...

07:34.872 --> 07:39.793
You come back to the lab and
you can tell me the whole megillah, hmm?

07:41.086 --> 07:41.879
Well... I huh...

07:42.379 --> 07:44.381
I have another lab.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.593
Bob, it's a cosmetics factory.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.179
It's a laboratory of the
olfactory sciences.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.273
We've got a Reimer.

08:01.899 --> 08:02.900
Really?

08:03.567 --> 08:05.402
It's amazing.
No bigger than a bar fridge.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.697
Turns salt water, human waste,
anything into pure drinking water.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.073
Except it has a flaw.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.992
Exactly. So we've got
to take it apart, figure out

08:11.992 --> 08:13.493
what poisoned
Louisa and her gang.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.580
And nobody can figure it out:
US military, private companies, NASA, nada.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.291
Sounds fascinating. But I've moved on.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.876
Professionally and emotionally.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.883
Bob, how long have we known
each other? Like...

08:28.383 --> 08:30.093
Ten years, 5 months, 4 days.

08:30.969 --> 08:34.097
Right. So, you just tell me
what you need to hear.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.600
Whatever it takes,
you're coming home to NorBAC.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.186
That's what you said the last time.
Remember?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.770
The last what time?

08:41.480 --> 08:42.481
When you had your first lab

08:42.688 --> 08:44.066
and you couldn't afford to pay
me for 6 months.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.777
"Whatever it takes, Bob,
I want you to stay."

08:47.903 --> 08:49.488
So I started moonlighting
for Miss Richmond.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.990
Yeah, and you were supposed
to quit when we got the NorBAC gig.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.701
Miss Richmond has always
encouraged my passion for perfumes.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.869
Let me get this straight.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.997
I'm understaffed, I'm overworked,
I'm dealing with cutting edge technology,

08:59.164 --> 09:01.667
but you'd rather be out there making
women smell better with beaver balls?

09:03.669 --> 09:05.504
- There, you did it again.
- What?

09:05.671 --> 09:06.964
You never listen.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.883
Jesus Christ, Bob!
What are you, my fucking wife?

09:09.967 --> 09:12.594
I told you. Not balls, glands.

09:17.683 --> 09:18.892
Fucking hell.

09:28.777 --> 09:29.903
Hey, how's it going?

09:29.987 --> 09:32.781
You really should have
a biochemist or a microbiologist on this.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.367
Well, one of them in Mexico
and the other one's on Venus.

09:35.492 --> 09:39.079
Did you give the analysis of the nano filter
material to Genwen like I told you?

09:39.371 --> 09:40.497
Yes. He's slow.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.791
He's methodical.
What'd you get?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.001
It's fabulous.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.795
Lead, arsenic, chromium,
radioactive metals.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.882
All removed at rates of 99.999 %.

09:50.174 --> 09:53.802
Do you want me to call Bob
or should Caroline?

09:54.595 --> 09:55.888
We will get a replacement.

09:55.888 --> 09:59.183
Right. Is there a senior biochemist
anywhere who's still talking to you?

09:59.474 --> 10:01.185
David! Jill's on line 4.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.103
Thank you, Weston,
your timing's impeccable.

10:08.192 --> 10:08.984
Yeah?

10:09.276 --> 10:11.069
David, everything's come up negative.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.781
I can't find anything that remotely
looks like a virus or a bacterium.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.283
What about epidemiology?

10:16.575 --> 10:17.868
Well, it's difficult to correlate.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.078
None of the victims have
any obvious factors in common

10:20.287 --> 10:21.580
that would point to a mode
of transmission.

10:21.872 --> 10:22.664
Not even food?

10:23.165 --> 10:25.584
Well, that looked good until
we came upon number 6,

10:25.876 --> 10:28.795
who's a hermit, completely isolated.
Even grew his own food.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.589
He bled to death when
he lost a tooth.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.966
Well, I guess that leaves you with
2 strong candidates:

10:33.175 --> 10:34.468
Airborne or waterborne.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.304
Yeah, Doctor Valada has
pretty much covered both those theories.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.473
I wouldn't trust anybody's
research on this.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.266
Okay. We'll get on it.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.769
David, has Bob said anything
about my experiment?

10:44.603 --> 10:45.687
Bob? Yeah!

10:45.896 --> 10:47.564
He says it's huh...
He says it's going well.

10:47.773 --> 10:48.982
Listen, Mayko needs me,
I've got to go.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.275
Oh... okay.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.485
What's wrong?

10:51.693 --> 10:52.486
Bye.

10:52.694 --> 10:56.490
You didn't hear?
Bob found out where Jill went wrong.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.077
- Shit. She made a mistake?
- Yep.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.287
Ooh, she'll go nuts.

11:02.704 --> 11:03.497
Yep.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.584
All right. Where's Bob?

11:16.301 --> 11:19.471
The red Xs show deaths,
the Os, recoveries.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.599
- Does it have the latest victims?
- As of midnight last night.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.269
Now, these are wind charts,

11:25.477 --> 11:28.480
but I couldn't get accurate
recent statistics.

11:28.772 --> 11:29.690
Why?

11:30.190 --> 11:33.402
Hum... Because the man who runs
the weather station here was victim 2.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.572
So, the arrows indicate

11:36.780 --> 11:39.867
historic wind speed and direction patterns
for this time of year,

11:40.075 --> 11:41.368
the larger the arrow,
the stronger the wind.

11:41.785 --> 11:45.581
It does not explain
the dissemination of the outbreak.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.375
Did you try running any
dynamic analysis?

11:48.876 --> 11:51.170
Enviro protocols,
all came up negative.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.380
So then, we're left with water.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.300
Which leaves us nowhere, because...

11:56.675 --> 11:57.593
Jill?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.096
Can you... Can you show me
that previous page, please?

12:01.597 --> 12:02.806
- With the wind?
- Yes.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.188
This is not what happened.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.774
We had lots of hot winds coming
from the south in the last few weeks.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
It's very unusual.

12:16.904 --> 12:17.696
So?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.574
This Reimer is incredible.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.200
Shit.

12:21.867 --> 12:22.576
Look.

12:23.785 --> 12:27.080
Jesus, the fluorite's like a 1000 times
greater than ultra porous membranes.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.999
I want one of these in my apartment.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.292
What do have left to look at?

12:30.501 --> 12:32.169
The analysis of the nano filter material.

12:33.504 --> 12:36.173
- Where is Genwen?
- Being methodical.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.676
You might as well warn Louisa
that things are looking bad.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.595
Me? You're the one
who brought her here.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.180
You're the one
who's fucking her.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.973
Hey! David, any progress?
Thank you.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.683
Yeah, check this out.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.980
Okay.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.089
Thirsty?

13:17.506 --> 13:19.967
What did you pour into it
at the front end?

13:20.092 --> 13:21.802
We want to see if you can
tell the difference.

13:22.094 --> 13:22.803
Between?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.680
- My piss and Mayko's.
- Oh, Jesus!

13:25.889 --> 13:27.474
Definitely Mayko's.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.184
How does it work?

13:29.393 --> 13:33.689
All right. Reimer uses this pretty amazing
nano particle filtration system, right?

13:34.189 --> 13:35.107
Nano particle?

13:35.274 --> 13:37.401
As in a nanometre wide.
One billionth of a metre.

13:37.568 --> 13:41.488
Right. So you put like, polluted water,
sweat, piss, whatever, through it and...

13:41.989 --> 13:43.490
the cleanest water you'll ever drink.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.367
Is there anything that
could get through?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.870
- Some minute trace elements.
- And that couldn't hurt me?

13:48.078 --> 13:50.873
No, your body's natural defences
will take care of whatever gets through.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.168
You've got to love
American know-how.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.879
Especially when it's based
on Soviet technology.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.383
So this suit, the Reimer,
they did what they were supposed to do?

14:01.592 --> 14:03.677
As far as we can tell, yeah.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.181
Unless we're missing something,
a nano chemical, a nano virus.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.267
A good biochemist might be helpful.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.604
Bob doesn't work here anymore, Mayko.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.899
It's a shame.
I hate to think we're missing something.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.985
You'd better start thinking
about getting down to Mexico.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.069
Right. Fine.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.289
This is the updated wind
pattern matrix.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.584
So you were right, Alejandro.
Winds from the south, but what's down there?

14:36.084 --> 14:38.295
- It's very remote.
- This isn't?

14:38.504 --> 14:41.673
More remote.
Very few people live there. No farming.

14:42.174 --> 14:42.883
Industry?

14:43.091 --> 14:43.592
No.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.678
- Military?
- No. Nothing. Nothing at all.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.097
Except the Yankees.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.898
Hey, there! Whoo! Thanks.

14:57.981 --> 14:58.482
Hey.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.107
Hi.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.692
- Welcome to Phat Phoods.
- Hi, Carlos--

15:00.901 --> 15:01.985
- I'm Angela Rover.
- Carlos Serrano.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.987
Hi. Jill Langston with NorBAC.

15:04.196 --> 15:04.988
Awesome.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.573
Very interesting set
up you have here.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.701
Oh, thanks, yeah. A bunch of us
were doing our PhD's at Bryce,

15:09.868 --> 15:12.788
doing our pharmacology,
biotech, botany, nutrition.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.791
How we met actually playing
ultimate Frisbee.

15:16.375 --> 15:19.169
But nobody wanted to work
for corporate jobs, so we started our own.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.297
So you're going to keep all
those millions for yourselves?

15:22.506 --> 15:25.300
No. No. These crops are not
designed to make millions,

15:25.467 --> 15:26.885
just to help millions.

15:27.386 --> 15:31.390
And there's nothing wrong with biotechnology,
just something wrong in how it's exploited.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.100
Angela, who funds you?

15:33.308 --> 15:37.271
We went to the Silicon Valley. Left
a week later with $ 20 million in start up.

15:37.396 --> 15:40.190
So, we moved here to
work and live cheaply.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.775
What are your test crops?

15:41.984 --> 15:43.777
We've got some bananas
that lower cholesterol,

15:43.986 --> 15:46.405
we've got some high-protein rice,

15:46.572 --> 15:47.990
hypoallergenic peanuts.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.367
So far it's a peanut that
everybody's allergic to.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.494
Here's something interesting.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.788
This is a mustard
we're developing.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.375
Grows just about anywhere and we're hoping
we can seed it using crop plants.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.377
And what's so special about it?

16:00.586 --> 16:04.173
Well, there are a hundred million
unexploded land mines in the world

16:04.506 --> 16:06.175
that are killing and maiming
an average of--

16:06.383 --> 16:09.094
- 26,000 people every year, yeah.
- Yeah. That's right.

16:09.303 --> 16:12.181
So, what we've done is we've
genetically modified this mustard

16:12.389 --> 16:16.185
so that if it comes in contact with
a buried land mine, it turns red not green.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.103
- That's incredible!
- I know.

16:18.270 --> 16:21.190
- Have you written this up?
- No, not yet. We've got a ways to go, so...

16:21.190 --> 16:22.274
And what are those?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.484
Okay, this is our crass commercial crop.

16:24.693 --> 16:28.488
Just something to make some funds.
It's onions that don't make you cry.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.200
- Oh. Any luck?
- Yeah, we're getting there.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.076
You know, we used to think that

16:33.202 --> 16:36.205
the cry factor was part of
the aroma flavour biochemistry

16:36.288 --> 16:37.998
and that the tears were a by-product.

16:38.290 --> 16:42.794
But in fact, the release of the cry factor
is just to ward off predators.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.672
So, an onion's like a skunk?

16:45.881 --> 16:46.798
Yeah, kind of.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.885
Fantastic. So, can we get samples?

16:50.093 --> 16:52.095
- Yeah, sure. Even of the onions?
- Everything.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.599
Hey, you don't think they're causing
the anticoagulation syndrome, do you?

16:55.974 --> 16:59.102
- Let's be sure.
- All right. Come this way.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.272
The lab totally sucks without you, Bob.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.107
That's nice.

17:04.775 --> 17:07.903
- We need you. David needs you.
- No, he doesn't.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.279
Yes, he does.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.491
Look, your brain is
so stuffed with ideas...

17:13.282 --> 17:14.785
A lot of it's misfiled.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.204
You go places his brain doesn't go.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.999
Unusual solutions. Well, let's face it,
your mind works differently.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.001
Why are these
so painful to open?

17:26.171 --> 17:28.089
So, you had a question?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.302
I guess it's... What...
What are we missing?

17:33.303 --> 17:34.471
Nothing gets through?

17:34.680 --> 17:37.599
- 1 in a million parts.
- That's not enough to make you sick.

17:37.808 --> 17:41.270
No, it's too diluted, right?
I mean, and we can't find anything

17:41.395 --> 17:43.897
that wouldn't get knocked-out
by your body's defences.

17:44.481 --> 17:48.986
What about something your body wouldn't
recognize? It wouldn't knock that out.

17:49.194 --> 17:50.195
Like what?

17:50.487 --> 17:52.906
I don't know. An impostor.
A Trojan horse?

17:53.198 --> 17:54.700
I don't know what
you're talking about, Bob.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.285
I don't know either.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.789
Hmm. That's lunch.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.499
I've got to go.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.008
Bob, think about it.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.595
Thanks, Mayko.

18:15.596 --> 18:17.389
Oh, say hi to everyone at the lab.

18:19.183 --> 18:19.683
Bye.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.695
So, that's it?

18:32.279 --> 18:35.073
We're all paranoid hypochondriacs?
A bunch of rip-off artists?

18:35.199 --> 18:36.074
Nobody said that.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.784
Yes, they did. Right to my face.

18:37.910 --> 18:38.785
It wasn't us.

18:38.994 --> 18:42.289
You know. When Mayko introduced you as
Dr. David Sandstrom, I said to myself:

18:42.497 --> 18:43.999
"Another fucking doctor!"

18:44.082 --> 18:46.001
I'm a doctor that fucks,
but I'm not a fucking doctor.

18:46.502 --> 18:50.172
Oh, yes, you are. I mean, you don't got
the penthouse and the Mercedes.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.883
You've got that
"even my shit's holy" attitude.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.385
Louisa, I am not talking about what happened,

18:55.594 --> 18:56.970
I'm talking about what we can prove.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.389
Well, if you can't prove what happened
then you suck.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.477
And now, you're just... You're leaving,
you're running off to Mexico.

19:03.602 --> 19:05.604
There's been an outbreak, okay!
People are dying.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.774
God damn it!
People are dying right here, David!

19:13.070 --> 19:15.572
All right, what is it?
What happened?

19:16.406 --> 19:17.574
Rita, uh...

19:18.909 --> 19:20.494
She died this morning.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.706
She's got kids, man.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.291
No history of the disease.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.793
Me neither.

19:28.377 --> 19:30.170
I'm going to need a mastectomy.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.005
Double for me.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.299
No, just don't.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.176
- Come here.
- No! You know what?

19:36.301 --> 19:37.386
- Louisa...
- No.

19:37.594 --> 19:38.804
Louisa, Louisa,

19:39.179 --> 19:40.389
Louisa.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.810
I'm sorry.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.688
Hey...

19:49.481 --> 19:50.482
I'm sorry.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.375
Smells like Indian food.
Definitely Southern.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.796
- Hi, David.
- Bob? What are you doing here?

20:13.172 --> 20:15.883
- I thought I was invited for dinner.
- Of course you were, Bob.

20:16.091 --> 20:19.469
Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.
Absolutely. Okay, get in here, Bob.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.390
Huh... Louisa, Bob Melnikov,
formerly of my lab. Louisa Raposa.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.684
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, Louisa. This is Gamelan.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.102
Hi, Gamelan.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.189
- Indian food. Coincidence.
- Why?

20:31.607 --> 20:33.400
- You remember E.H. Hankin?
- Yeah.

20:33.609 --> 20:36.195
In 1896, he was the one who
discovered that the River Ganges,

20:36.278 --> 20:39.907
an open sewer, really did have
magical powers when you drank it,

20:40.407 --> 20:44.203
but when you boiled the water to kill
the germs, it lost it's magical powers.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.370
Why?

20:45.871 --> 20:49.291
Cholera. People had cholera
and there was something in the Ganges

20:49.583 --> 20:53.587
that when you drank it, it killed
the spread of the cholera bacteria.

20:53.795 --> 20:54.379
What was it?

20:54.505 --> 20:56.006
- Bacteria phages.
- Sorry, what?

20:56.173 --> 20:59.801
Bacteria phages.
Viruses that infect bacteria.

21:00.177 --> 21:01.470
Where are you going with this, Bob?

21:01.803 --> 21:03.680
Well, I was thinking DNA transfer.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.391
Unrecognized bacteria,
no immune response.

21:06.892 --> 21:08.185
Holy shit!

21:08.685 --> 21:10.479
Wait, what are we talking about?

21:11.897 --> 21:14.107
Well, okay, let's say you know
you've got some nasty bacteria

21:14.191 --> 21:15.192
in the salt marshes in Iraq,

21:15.192 --> 21:17.611
so you're going to want to run this
through a filtration system

21:17.778 --> 21:19.196
- like the Reimer, right?
- Yeah, they did that.

21:19.488 --> 21:22.074
But wouldn't the filtration system
keep the bacteria from getting through?

21:22.282 --> 21:24.409
All but 10 in a million,
as we've discovered.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.704
Right, and that's nothing for your body's
natural immune system to take care of.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.999
That's why people have been
calling you a paranoid hypochondriac.

21:31.375 --> 21:36.880
But, if those 10 little bacteria
got infected with bacteria phages,

21:37.798 --> 21:39.675
that's all it would take.
Isn't it, Bob?

21:39.800 --> 21:42.010
- That's my theory.
- What theory?

21:45.097 --> 21:46.390
It's not the bacteria,

21:46.598 --> 21:50.477
it's the bacteria phages infecting
the bacteria, that's the problem.

21:51.770 --> 21:52.688
Check it out.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.110
Let's say this is
one of the nasty bacteria

21:58.277 --> 22:01.697
that managed to miraculously get through
the Reimer unscathed, okay.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.908
All by itself, not a problem.
One would think, except,

22:05.492 --> 22:09.705
it's been infected with
a bacteria phage, which is a virus.

22:09.872 --> 22:12.291
So, it multiplies
and pretty soon,

22:12.499 --> 22:16.503
1 becomes a million
and eventually they bust out.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.880
Now, here's the thing.

22:18.088 --> 22:22.009
Some bacteria phages
can carry DNA.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.971
So, when they all explode out of the cell,
and remember, there's millions of them,

22:26.305 --> 22:29.391
they could be carrying toxic genes

22:29.683 --> 22:32.186
that they've picked up
from the nasty bacteria.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.980
Toxic genes attack internal organs.

22:35.189 --> 22:37.774
They can develop cancer cells,
they can do anything.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.903
Bob, you're a genius.

22:41.403 --> 22:45.199
Only if we can prove that that's
what happened to Louisa and her friends.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.783
Otherwise, I'm still just Bob.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.577
No, Bob, you're a genius.

22:50.495 --> 22:51.496
Thank you, David.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.875
Do you think this could be it?

22:55.584 --> 22:58.504
It's a way. It may be the only
way that would explain

22:58.795 --> 23:03.675
how this ship from the marshes in Iraq
managed to find a home inside you.

23:05.594 --> 23:07.804
Hey, food's here guys,
if you're hungry.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.477
- Sorry? What?
- No, he's not hungry.

23:13.602 --> 23:14.394
He's not hungry?

23:14.686 --> 23:15.812
- Smells good.
- Yeah.

23:15.979 --> 23:18.273
I don't even know what I have
here, there was no menu.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.192
She just sort of told me
what I should eat.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.611
Let's see what we've got.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.490
Ah, this is pampana in salsa verde...

23:27.282 --> 23:28.492
- Fish?
- Muy bien.

23:29.076 --> 23:30.494
Hmm, very good.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.706
- Ooh. Is that cocinita pibil?
- I have no idea.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.708
- You have to try that, it's very good.
- Okay.

23:40.212 --> 23:44.091
Ave Maria purisima.
Are those papasules?

23:44.675 --> 23:45.384
I don't know.

23:45.801 --> 23:48.011
Jill, you have to try that,
that's like the best thing.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.179
Forget the pibil.

23:49.304 --> 23:49.805
Okay.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.474
Jill, Jill, try one of those,
they're great.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.602
- Okay. Do you want one?
- Sure. I'll take a bite.

23:56.186 --> 23:59.690
So, it looks like they've inserted
a genetic splice into the mustard

24:00.107 --> 24:02.484
that causes it
to react to the nitric oxides

24:02.693 --> 24:04.695
that leak out of the explosives
into the soil.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.198
It might affect
nitric oxide in your body.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.702
- No, the genetic splice...
- Not this, okay.

24:11.910 --> 24:12.286
No.

24:13.412 --> 24:15.873
And nitric oxide levels
inhibit blood clots.

24:19.501 --> 24:20.502
That's delicious.

24:20.711 --> 24:22.588
Results just came in from
Berkley and they genotyped it.

24:22.713 --> 24:26.008
So, from left to right.
New samples, archival water from the UN,

24:26.091 --> 24:27.676
and one we found in Louisa's blood.

24:27.885 --> 24:29.303
Similar but different.

24:29.303 --> 24:32.306
All right, let's look specifically
for virulence genes. Bob?

24:32.681 --> 24:33.473
I'm on it.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.185
Hi Bob, nice to have you back.

24:36.393 --> 24:38.103
Oh, thanks Wes,
but it's just temporary.

24:38.687 --> 24:39.396
Sure.

24:39.688 --> 24:40.689
- You off?
- Yeah.

24:45.611 --> 24:46.195
Yeah.

24:46.695 --> 24:47.779
- David, it's Carlos.
- Hey.

24:47.905 --> 24:50.782
So, we thought we had the critical link,
this GMO mustard,

24:50.991 --> 24:52.409
but our test didn't hold up.

24:52.576 --> 24:53.994
- I can't hear you very well.
- What?

24:54.286 --> 24:56.997
- What was the problem?
- The problem is that we were wrong.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.082
Nothing in the genetically-altered plant

24:59.291 --> 25:02.002
could cause the magnitude of the disorder
showing up in the victims.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.213
Have you got an alternative hypothesis?

25:04.379 --> 25:05.380
None.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.799
- Make one up.
- Believe me, I'm trying David.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.676
Look, when can you get down here?

25:09.885 --> 25:12.387
I'm on a flight tomorrow. I want
to finish up with this Reimer thing first.

25:12.888 --> 25:14.890
- Oh, you got something?
- We're close. Let me speak to Jill.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.100
Huh, she's indisposed.

25:17.392 --> 25:19.478
- Meaning?
- She's in the servicios.

25:19.895 --> 25:22.189
The toilet, the loo, the W-C.

25:22.773 --> 25:23.982
Ah, well, don't give up.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.902
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Bring toilet paper.

25:27.402 --> 25:28.779
The softer, the better.

25:28.987 --> 25:29.988
I use a bidet.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.581
- ... temporary.
- Sure.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.375
- You off?
- Yeah, see you.

25:45.212 --> 25:48.590
I can be at the gym in like, 20 minutes.
Want to get some Korean afterwards?

25:49.591 --> 25:51.009
Just hold on a second.

25:52.886 --> 25:53.887
Crap.

25:58.809 --> 26:02.813
Yeah, I, uh... I'll see you there.
All right, Manny, great.

26:06.483 --> 26:07.609
How are you doing?

26:07.901 --> 26:10.988
- What are you doing here, Elliott?
- Yeah, nice to see you too.

26:12.114 --> 26:14.700
- Is there somewhere we can go and talk?
- I've got nothing to say.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.410
Look, I just drove 12 hours to get here.

26:16.410 --> 26:18.078
The least you can do is have
a drink with me.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.204
Are you drinking again, Elliott?

26:19.288 --> 26:20.873
I guess this born again thing
is working out about as well as

26:20.998 --> 26:23.208
- all your other endeavours, huh?
- I was thinking coffee.

26:24.376 --> 26:25.377
Sorry, I've got plans.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.713
Oh yeah? Where are you prancing off to?
You've got some cock to suck?

26:28.088 --> 26:28.881
Fuck you!

26:32.301 --> 26:33.385
Grow up, Elliott!

26:48.483 --> 26:50.110
Hey, it's all right.

26:51.195 --> 26:51.778
Fuck!

26:51.987 --> 26:52.779
I'm out of here.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.198
Just escort him, please.

26:55.282 --> 26:57.492
Wes, are you okay?

26:58.702 --> 26:59.786
Who was that?

27:00.787 --> 27:02.206
My brother.

27:03.081 --> 27:03.999
Nice.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.377
Well, don't give up.
See you tomorrow.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.589
I use a bidet.

27:13.884 --> 27:16.512
Elliott never had much time
for Aunt Rose.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.014
A couple of years ago,
he found Jesus.

27:19.306 --> 27:22.309
Beating up one's brother
doesn't seem very Christian.

27:24.603 --> 27:26.605
Rose had a stroke 3 years ago

27:27.105 --> 27:30.275
and I had to put her
into this healthcare facility.

27:30.776 --> 27:33.779
But she made me the power of attorney
so that I could manage her estate.

27:34.279 --> 27:35.489
Big estate?

27:36.782 --> 27:38.492
She had stocks and uh...

27:38.700 --> 27:41.578
A great house in West Palm Beach
which she doesn't want to give up.

27:42.204 --> 27:45.582
Some land in Montana
that she ain't going to sell

27:46.375 --> 27:48.585
that's about worth 3 million dollars.

27:49.294 --> 27:51.505
And you get it all
when she dies?

27:51.713 --> 27:52.506
No.

27:53.590 --> 27:55.509
No, both of us, actually.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.805
It's like...

27:59.888 --> 28:01.515
We're all that she has left

28:02.182 --> 28:04.476
but she's going to be around
for a long, long time.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.313
And your brother wants
his share now?

28:08.897 --> 28:12.192
Yeah. That's all I talked
about the last two years.

28:15.279 --> 28:16.905
You going to be okay?

28:18.490 --> 28:19.491
Thank you.

28:24.705 --> 28:28.584
So, a few bacteria phages from the Iraqi
marshes got through the Reimer's filter?

28:28.792 --> 28:29.293
That's right.

28:29.501 --> 28:33.380
Enough to cause breast cancer,
kidney failure, fibromyalgia?

28:33.589 --> 28:36.300
Well, bacteria phages
amplify themselves

28:36.592 --> 28:37.593
and as they do this,

28:37.676 --> 28:41.388
they infect your natural bacteria
with new genetic material, okay?

28:41.513 --> 28:43.390
So this could cause the good
bacteria to mutate

28:43.974 --> 28:45.475
and start secreting toxins

28:45.684 --> 28:48.687
which causes everything
from cancer to organ failure.

28:48.979 --> 28:51.690
But from the outside, they still look like
your friendly neighbourhood bacteria.

28:52.482 --> 28:53.901
Bob's idea, Trojan horse.

28:53.984 --> 28:55.110
And now, the toxins are out there

28:55.194 --> 28:57.112
and they're able to spread to
every corner of your body.

28:57.279 --> 28:59.114
Which is why they cause
so many different illnesses.

28:59.615 --> 29:01.408
- Why didn't' everyone get sick?
- Exactly.

29:01.575 --> 29:04.203
We need to find out if
the immune systems of the healthy ones

29:04.286 --> 29:05.913
were able to conquer any mutating bacteria

29:06.079 --> 29:09.082
or if they just became carriers,
spreading it without even realising it.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.710
We need our chief virologist to
figure that part out.

29:11.877 --> 29:13.504
Which is why, Jill,
you're on the next plane up.

29:13.587 --> 29:15.214
David will take your place in Mexico.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.090
That's fine with me.
How soon do you want me back there?

29:17.216 --> 29:18.383
I'm on the next flight down.

29:18.592 --> 29:21.303
Oh, good! I'll wave at you as
our planes pass over Chicago.

29:21.512 --> 29:22.679
Carlos, you still there?

29:22.888 --> 29:26.808
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.
Someone has to keep you out of trouble.

29:27.392 --> 29:28.477
Adios, amigo.

29:30.187 --> 29:33.482
Mayko is going to put everything
we found out in a great big, fat file,

29:33.815 --> 29:35.692
full of colour pictures and graphs

29:35.901 --> 29:39.404
and diagrams and the resumes
of everybody who works at the lab.

29:39.780 --> 29:42.699
With that, you should be able to
get a lawyer anywhere to take your case.

29:42.908 --> 29:44.993
Yeah, well, you know,
I can see it now, man.

29:45.494 --> 29:47.913
The suit manufacturers will
blame the canister.

29:48.205 --> 29:49.790
The canister people
will blame the Reimer.

29:49.998 --> 29:51.875
The Reimer people
will blame the contractors

29:52.000 --> 29:54.711
and the contractors will
blame the army, who will blame the suit.

29:54.795 --> 29:56.713
- See what I'm saying?
- You knew all that going in.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.509
Oh no, no. I learned that along the way.
But once I start there's no stopping me.

30:01.093 --> 30:03.679
Well, you'll get justice, eventually.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.890
Yeah, but the lawyers pocket
most of the money.

30:08.183 --> 30:10.102
Hey, come over here.

30:18.485 --> 30:19.486
I got you.

30:35.210 --> 30:37.796
What about you, you motherfucker?
You're leaving me.

30:39.006 --> 30:42.092
Stay. I'll be back soon.
Or come with me.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.387
I got to go home to Jersey.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.098
I got to get this lawsuit going.

30:48.807 --> 30:50.601
I got to get on with my life.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.001
Thanks.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.378
Bienvenido à Mexico,
Senior Sandstrom.

31:18.795 --> 31:20.297
Oh, necessita una cerveca!

31:21.381 --> 31:22.382
That's necessito.

31:22.716 --> 31:23.675
It's necessita.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.177
For a guy, necessito.

31:25.385 --> 31:26.678
Just give me a fucking beer.

31:27.179 --> 31:29.598
I got it. I got it.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.685
We've had 3 deaths
since we've been here,

31:33.810 --> 31:35.479
but that's only
because the Mexican military

31:35.687 --> 31:37.689
has half the army shuttling
people to the hospitals.

31:37.898 --> 31:39.483
There's no let up in cases.

31:39.608 --> 31:40.400
How many?

31:40.484 --> 31:43.904
125 a week, with blood transfusions
they all seem to recover.

31:44.696 --> 31:46.698
I still think the altered
mustard is a good candidate.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.617
It's not airborne, David.

31:48.784 --> 31:49.701
Yeah, I know,
but I'm thinking maybe

31:49.785 --> 31:52.079
the ground water
got polluted with the nitric oxide.

31:52.704 --> 31:55.582
A long shot. And you know what,
I'm running out of other ideas.

31:55.791 --> 31:58.085
Well, let's go to the reservoir
and get some water samples, huh?

31:58.502 --> 31:59.586
What reservoir?

31:59.795 --> 32:01.004
The one we're going to find.

32:05.384 --> 32:06.385
Oh, fuck!

32:06.510 --> 32:08.595
You sure you don't want some netting?
I have it in the Jeep.

32:08.679 --> 32:09.680
No, no! I'm fine.

32:12.683 --> 32:15.102
What's going on with
Jill's experiment?

32:15.310 --> 32:17.479
Bob sent me an e-mail,
said it was all screwed up.

32:17.688 --> 32:21.900
You know, when I was teaching
grad students, I told them

32:22.109 --> 32:26.280
All mistakes are not created equal,
and the earlier you make a mistake,

32:26.488 --> 32:28.782
the farther off course
you're going to end up.

32:28.991 --> 32:32.411
So, you've got to be diligent so
your mistakes can be postponed.

32:33.287 --> 32:34.788
Hopefully to another lifetime.

32:35.581 --> 32:36.582
You told Jill?

32:36.915 --> 32:38.083
Not yet.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.294
What are you waiting for?

32:41.712 --> 32:45.090
I'm hoping to postpone it
to another lifetime. Oh! Fuck!

32:53.307 --> 32:54.099
Hey!

32:54.892 --> 32:58.312
We're dealing with an acute
anticoagulation pathology here, right?

32:58.812 --> 32:59.313
Yeah.

32:59.897 --> 33:02.608
Mosquitoes can cause anticoagulation.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.485
David, do you realise
how much anticoagulant you would need

33:05.777 --> 33:08.113
to reach the levels we've been
monitoring in the victims?

33:08.197 --> 33:09.990
You would need millions
and millions of bites.

33:10.616 --> 33:12.701
I feel like I have a million.
Fuck off!

33:13.785 --> 33:15.412
What if we're dealing
with a bunch of mosquitoes

33:15.495 --> 33:17.497
that flew too close
to a nuclear power station

33:17.581 --> 33:21.293
and got radioactively-enhanced
super mosquito powers, eh?

33:24.880 --> 33:26.590
Well, there goes that theory.

34:09.091 --> 34:10.509
Okay, results.

34:19.393 --> 34:21.395
Whose dumb idea was that?

34:24.398 --> 34:26.692
What do you know
about mosquito genes?

34:27.400 --> 34:30.404
Which one?
They have about 14,000 of them.

34:30.696 --> 34:32.406
Seems to me we're missing the obvious.

34:32.614 --> 34:35.701
I mean, mosquitoes use an anticoagulant
to keep your blood from clotting

34:35.909 --> 34:37.286
while they take it.

34:37.703 --> 34:40.205
There's this GMO facility
in the neighbourhood

34:40.496 --> 34:43.208
with god-knows-what kind of
crazy genes floating around inside.

34:43.792 --> 34:48.213
Who's to say there aren't a couple of
super mosquitoes flying around out there?

34:49.715 --> 34:52.885
We would have to test
a million mosquitoes.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.679
We could offer a peso
per mosquito.

34:57.181 --> 34:59.183
How about a beer for a bottleful?

35:04.104 --> 35:06.481
Hey, Elliott, it's me.
I think we should talk.

35:06.982 --> 35:08.692
- Wes...
- Just hold on a second, please.

35:08.817 --> 35:11.403
Hi, these are the receipts
for our flight, hotels,

35:11.612 --> 35:13.989
some food,
but most of it went in the garbage.

35:14.198 --> 35:16.700
Just fill in the receipt forms,
photocopy it and then file them on Monday.

35:17.284 --> 35:18.994
Come on, be a pal?

35:20.913 --> 35:21.580
Bye.

35:22.998 --> 35:25.709
Sorry about that.
I really think we should.

35:26.418 --> 35:28.212
Because we should, come on...

35:29.296 --> 35:30.506
Oh, hi Jill.

35:31.715 --> 35:34.218
Did David tell you where I think
you made the mistake in your experiment?

35:34.718 --> 35:36.178
"It's pretty simple, really."

35:36.386 --> 35:39.806
It turns out the cells you used was never
the immediate transcription response..."

35:51.401 --> 35:53.779
I'm sorry, we all make mistakes.

36:16.885 --> 36:19.012
Carlos, come take a look at this.

36:20.013 --> 36:22.015
The results just came in from Berkley.

36:24.184 --> 36:25.602
What the hell caused that?

36:26.687 --> 36:27.813
Water pollution?

36:27.980 --> 36:30.607
No, don't say air pollution either.
Right there.

36:31.191 --> 36:32.609
I see an anomaly but...

36:32.985 --> 36:34.778
That has been
genetically engineered.

36:34.987 --> 36:36.196
What? No. No.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.699
Maybe something jumped the
species barrier...

36:38.907 --> 36:40.701
It's man-made.

36:41.618 --> 36:44.913
No. The sequence shows there's
a malinari element on some plasma DNA.

36:44.997 --> 36:46.790
It's going to take us forever
to figure it out down here.

36:46.999 --> 36:49.001
We're going to have to get this
mosquito flown back to Bob.

36:49.209 --> 36:51.003
Okay. Well, you think globally,
I will shop locally.

36:51.211 --> 36:51.587
All right.

36:59.803 --> 37:02.181
So, this is what you call
middle class living?

37:04.516 --> 37:05.809
Sit down, Elliott.

37:08.187 --> 37:10.814
What's this proposition that
you want to put out there?

37:11.982 --> 37:13.692
The way I see it, this is fair.

37:14.318 --> 37:17.196
Every time that you've gotten
into trouble, I've been there for you.

37:17.487 --> 37:18.906
When you lost your job,

37:18.989 --> 37:21.200
when you were trying to go dry,
both times, I was there.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.118
Yeah. That's the old Elliott.

37:23.702 --> 37:26.079
When it was time to move Rose
from her house to the home,

37:26.205 --> 37:29.917
I'm the one that helped her pack,
I moved her, I visited her...

37:30.417 --> 37:32.711
I was going through a divorce, Wes.

37:34.004 --> 37:35.297
This is my proposal.

37:36.381 --> 37:39.009
I want to give you $100,000
out of my pocket.

37:40.010 --> 37:41.720
That's all I have to give.

37:42.804 --> 37:45.891
But when Rose dies,
I want to keep the house.

37:46.099 --> 37:50.103
That's fucking bullshit!
The house is worth 10 times that much.

37:50.312 --> 37:52.981
We'll still be splitting the estate.
Elliott, you'll get a fair share.

38:00.489 --> 38:01.615
I've been gambling.

38:02.616 --> 38:03.784
Jesus Christ!

38:03.992 --> 38:05.994
I owe money, Wes.
I owe a lot of money.

38:06.203 --> 38:07.412
That's all I have to offer, man.

38:07.496 --> 38:09.081
Well, sell the fucking house in Florida.

38:09.206 --> 38:10.415
Rose isn't going to sell it.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.501
You make her sell it,
you god damn...

38:13.418 --> 38:14.419
faggot.

38:15.879 --> 38:17.381
Your co-workers
know you're a fag?

38:18.382 --> 38:21.093
- I'm not gay, Elliott.
- Fuck off, you've got AIDS, don't you?

38:21.301 --> 38:22.719
I've got HIV.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.808
I got it from a prostitute in Prague.

38:30.519 --> 38:33.397
She was so fucking beautiful, man.

38:34.189 --> 38:37.401
For 10 extra bucks,
I didn't even have to use a condom.

38:39.486 --> 38:42.281
See? Stupidity runs in our family.

38:45.909 --> 38:48.412
I don't believe you, Wes.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.998
I don't give a fuck
what you believe. Go.

38:59.298 --> 39:02.801
No. No one is doing GMO work
with mosquitoes in Mexico but...

39:06.180 --> 39:07.014
Yeah?

39:07.389 --> 39:08.307
It's Mayko.

39:08.390 --> 39:10.684
Oh, hey Mayko.
I'm going to put you on speaker.

39:11.518 --> 39:13.020
Hey, Mayko.
How's it going up there?

39:13.312 --> 39:15.814
Bob's doing the PCR of
the mosquito splice.

39:15.981 --> 39:21.612
So... I got this off sciencesucks.com,
stop shaking your heads. I know you are.

39:21.987 --> 39:24.489
Anyway, people in the
French-language chatroom

39:24.698 --> 39:27.284
say there's a Belgian biotech
doing research on mosquitoes.

39:27.618 --> 39:28.493
Where?

39:28.702 --> 39:30.913
- No one knows.
- Mosquitoes and what?

39:32.206 --> 39:33.916
Couldn't find out.

39:34.917 --> 39:36.293
Well, how do they know?

39:36.418 --> 39:38.921
This guy went out with a woman
who used to work there.

39:39.004 --> 39:40.088
Jesus, Mayko!

39:40.214 --> 39:42.216
Well, what did you find out, David?

39:42.799 --> 39:46.386
Nothing. Did you call the company
and ask them?

39:46.803 --> 39:48.680
- No.
- No?

39:49.014 --> 39:51.308
God! How come
you're so fucking smart?

39:52.518 --> 39:53.393
Cheers.

39:53.602 --> 39:54.311
Salud!

39:59.983 --> 40:00.901
Yeah?

40:01.485 --> 40:02.903
They're over the border
in Guatemala.

40:03.111 --> 40:03.987
Guatemala?

40:04.404 --> 40:06.782
Yeah, they're there because
the government has excused them

40:06.990 --> 40:09.785
from all environmental laws.
They actually told me that!

40:10.494 --> 40:13.997
They're about 400 km south of you.
The company is called Entogène.

40:14.206 --> 40:17.501
You want to talk to a
Jacques Rafause.

40:18.502 --> 40:22.297
Malaria, she kills over
2 million people a year in Africa alone.

40:22.714 --> 40:24.383
And it's caused by a parasite.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.095
The parasite, she spread in the
saliva of the mosquito. The mosquito...

40:28.804 --> 40:32.683
... inserts the parasites, along with
anticoagulation saliva into the human.

40:32.891 --> 40:34.601
So, what we have done at Entogène

40:34.810 --> 40:37.020
is to genetically alter the mosquito

40:37.312 --> 40:40.983
so that an anti parasitic protein
in the salivary gland of the mosquito

40:41.191 --> 40:44.695
is over expressed to kill the parasite
before it reaches the human.

40:44.987 --> 40:46.613
And so, we eradicate malaria.

40:46.822 --> 40:50.409
Yeah, Dr. Rafause, Dr. Rafause...
Could we review your documentation?

40:50.701 --> 40:51.910
Absolutely.

40:52.703 --> 40:53.996
I will make espresso.

41:33.493 --> 41:35.621
Carlos, come here and take
a look at this sucker.

41:36.914 --> 41:38.790
The doc engineered
a chromosome right here

41:38.999 --> 41:42.503
using a p-element containing
a salivary gland specific promoter.

41:44.505 --> 41:47.299
- A transposon?
- Yeah, a jumping gene.

41:47.508 --> 41:49.593
Hey, a Mexican jumping gene!

41:50.719 --> 41:54.890
A transposon is unstable DNA
that jumps from one gene to another.

41:55.098 --> 41:58.101
In this case, it was a multiplying
transposon that they spliced in

41:58.310 --> 42:00.395
and it jumped from where they put it

42:00.604 --> 42:04.191
in the antiparasite gene and it found
itself a nice cozy little home next

42:04.399 --> 42:06.818
to an anticoagulation gene in the mosquito.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.404
- That happens?
- Well, I'm not making this shit up.

42:09.821 --> 42:10.989
Now the mosquito,

42:11.281 --> 42:15.494
well his anticoagulation proteins
are being hugely, hugely overproduced.

42:15.702 --> 42:18.121
He's basically a factory
for anticoagulant.

42:18.413 --> 42:21.583
So, it blocks coagulation
in the mosquito's human victims.

42:22.084 --> 42:23.502
The body bleeds to death.

42:23.710 --> 42:25.921
We think the anti clotting
last for about 24 hours.

42:26.088 --> 42:28.507
Afterwards, the body recovers.
But in those 24 hours,

42:29.091 --> 42:33.011
if you cut yourself, say scrape
your knee, you basically bleed to death.

42:34.888 --> 42:37.015
Even if... the males don't bite

42:37.099 --> 42:39.601
and the recombining females
are all trapped in there.

42:39.685 --> 42:41.186
How could they escape?

42:41.311 --> 42:43.313
- May we, Dr. Rafause?
- Sure.

42:52.489 --> 42:55.200
- Hmm... How are you getting out?
- They don't.

42:56.118 --> 42:57.494
What about the males?

42:57.995 --> 43:02.791
We hatch here, harvest the females
and kill the males.

43:02.916 --> 43:04.585
How do you sex the females?

43:04.918 --> 43:06.295
It's an old trick.

43:06.795 --> 43:09.214
The females want blood for reproduction,

43:09.423 --> 43:12.384
so we put a bag full of warm water
on top of the cage.

43:12.718 --> 43:16.388
The females are attracted to the warmth
and congregate around the bag

43:16.722 --> 43:18.390
and with a vacuum cleaner,

43:18.599 --> 43:22.311
I can suck out the males
and leave the females inside the cage.

43:22.519 --> 43:25.814
What are the chances you might suck out
1 of the females by mistake?

43:26.190 --> 43:27.983
0.01 %.

43:28.609 --> 43:32.404
That, doctor, is not as low a number
as you might think.

43:32.613 --> 43:34.990
It might allow some of the
females to stay with the males.

43:35.199 --> 43:36.491
What's the difference?

43:36.700 --> 43:39.786
The males get killed.
So, I lose a few females too.

43:40.787 --> 43:42.915
- Can you show us how you do it?
- Sure.

43:44.082 --> 43:47.211
So, I use a vacuum cleaner.
Will you hold it for me, please?

43:50.422 --> 43:53.217
So, you insert in there.

44:00.599 --> 44:02.100
And then...

44:02.518 --> 44:07.189
the bag of the vacuum cleaner
is burned in the room over there.

44:07.523 --> 44:09.107
Nothing gets out.

44:18.617 --> 44:20.118
Yeah, but...

44:20.494 --> 44:22.412
They would have
to get out of the room.

44:22.621 --> 44:23.789
Well, let's see.

44:37.094 --> 44:38.512
Merde!

44:45.310 --> 44:47.813
Pasteur Institute got back to us.
They have an experimental larvicide

44:48.021 --> 44:51.400
that only kills mosquitoes and has
no known effects on any other species.

44:51.483 --> 44:53.694
The Mexican air force is going
to take care of the aerial spray.

44:53.819 --> 44:57.114
Oh, that's great. Let's get
a report out to Connor on the Reimer.

44:57.322 --> 44:59.700
Jill's working on it. We're going
to have something by the end of the week.

44:59.908 --> 45:04.621
Okay. Bob? Could we steal you for a few
days to help Jill with that report?

45:04.913 --> 45:07.708
Oh well, I think I could find
the time to do it at home.

45:08.500 --> 45:12.004
Okay, then, Bob. If there's
anything you need, just let me know.

45:14.923 --> 45:16.008
You wanted to see me?

45:16.091 --> 45:16.800
Yes.

45:18.302 --> 45:20.512
Bob, I want you to stay.

45:22.014 --> 45:23.891
I think when it comes to work,

45:23.891 --> 45:27.186
you do your best.
You try your damn hardest, right?

45:27.519 --> 45:29.813
So, make sure you work
somewhere challenging

45:30.022 --> 45:32.816
where your mind and
your spirit are both engaged.

45:32.983 --> 45:34.401
But perfume is challenging.

45:34.985 --> 45:37.696
But NorBAC isn't the same
as everywhere else.

45:37.905 --> 45:38.989
No?

45:39.615 --> 45:42.409
It's more fun,
more interesting.

45:42.618 --> 45:44.203
So that means you might stay?

45:45.704 --> 45:47.706
I can't. I already left.

45:54.505 --> 45:56.590
Melnikov Magic.

45:59.718 --> 46:00.385
Oh!

46:01.220 --> 46:02.221
Wow!

46:03.388 --> 46:04.306
Not bad.

46:04.598 --> 46:05.724
It's fabulous.

46:05.891 --> 46:08.894
It's based on ancient
Aztec plants and herbs,

46:09.102 --> 46:12.189
an untapped universe for perfumery.
You really like it?

46:12.397 --> 46:13.398
Yeah.

46:14.983 --> 46:16.818
Oh. Miss Richmond says it's too subtle.

46:17.319 --> 46:20.822
Miss Richmond likes everything
on the nose. That's perfume talk.

46:21.907 --> 46:24.993
I mean, there's a full orchestra
of scents and sensibilities

46:25.619 --> 46:27.412
but all she wants are the
strings and horns

46:27.704 --> 46:31.708
and I want to do something with
the oils from the Guarani.

46:31.917 --> 46:33.919
I've been e-mailing a tribal shaman

46:34.086 --> 46:36.213
who says he can source us
leaves from the Amazon

46:36.296 --> 46:40.217
but Miss Richmond says its too expensive
and I should use synthetics instead.

46:40.300 --> 46:41.385
- Synthetics?
- I know.

46:46.890 --> 46:48.517
Can I come back?

46:51.520 --> 46:54.314
Hemorrhagic fever in smallpox.

46:55.190 --> 46:56.108
Game over.

46:56.608 --> 46:57.484
MI-5.

46:57.484 --> 46:58.694
MI-5? Cool!

46:59.403 --> 47:02.114
Listen, we need to talk.
Our friend Martin Jamieson,

47:02.322 --> 47:04.491
a.k.a William Zanzinger
was found dead in Cape Town.

47:04.616 --> 47:08.287
Write this down. Bethke Labs,
B-e-t-h-k-e Labs,

47:08.412 --> 47:09.788
Cape Town, South Africa.

47:09.997 --> 47:12.207
Tell James Bond to get us
all the biohazard samples he can.

47:12.708 --> 47:15.002
Well, I think we should keep
Gamelan here for a couple of days,

47:15.419 --> 47:16.420
put her on a drip.

47:17.004 --> 47:19.423
There's no reason to go home.
My dog's in the hospital.

47:20.299 --> 47:21.216
Gammy?

47:22.217 --> 47:23.510
What's wrong with her?

47:24.219 --> 47:25.304
From the motherland.

47:25.596 --> 47:27.806
Wait a minute, this is weaponized?

47:28.015 --> 47:32.102
It looks like they increased
the incubation period of the virus.

47:32.686 --> 47:35.397
See? You're learning a little science,
I'm learning a little intelligence.

47:35.606 --> 47:38.400
Right now, one of those countries
may be the biggest threat.

47:38.525 --> 47:39.318
Caroline, please!

47:39.484 --> 47:40.694
Colin, tell me.

47:40.819 --> 47:42.321
Let me do my job.

47:43.822 --> 47:45.490
He's pointing a loaded gun
right at us again.

47:45.908 --> 47:47.409
Jesus Christ!
