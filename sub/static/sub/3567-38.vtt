<i><font color=#ca> ~ Fora Temer ~ </font></i>

00:04.887 --> 00:07.306
Ooh-hoo!

00:07.374 --> 00:10.276
You got freezer burned, Pearl!
Looks like you lose

00:10.343 --> 00:12.044
- all your fish sticks.
- What?!

00:12.112 --> 00:14.313
I needed those for my
"bachelor meal combo."

00:14.414 --> 00:16.081
Now I can't ring the dinner bell.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.716
These rules make no sense.

00:17.784 --> 00:20.219
The game of citchen
calamity may be played

00:20.287 --> 00:24.623
for fun, but the hunger is real!

00:24.691 --> 00:28.627
Tough break, Pearl.
"The sponge in your sink

00:28.695 --> 00:31.430
is covered in mold."
But I can still eat it, right?

00:31.498 --> 00:34.099
No, no, that means
you lose two turns.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.268
- That's bologna!
- Wait!

00:36.336 --> 00:38.471
- You have a bologna card?
- Garnet, your move.

00:39.837 --> 00:45.277
I'm now the owner of
the golden can opener. Yessss.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.705
Now you can check your
soups for the alphabet bonus!

00:48.706 --> 00:53.285
- Who wrote this game?
- My turn!

00:53.353 --> 00:57.242
I've got to roll the
dice to escape the eggquake!

00:58.881 --> 01:01.427
Come on.
Papa needs a new skillet!

01:03.241 --> 01:08.334
Yeah! Double sunnies!
I did it! I win!

01:08.401 --> 01:12.360
Yeah! This citchen calamity
has been cleaned up!

01:12.361 --> 01:14.904
Whoo-hoo!

01:14.939 --> 01:19.578
- I don't get it, but nice job.
- Yes, well done.

01:19.679 --> 01:22.314
That was very... very
complicated.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.184
Well played.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.186
So, what do you want to play next?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.688
- There are more?
- Oh, sure!

01:29.756 --> 01:33.359
I've got polypoly, toppler, and
conquerors of eldermore...

01:33.426 --> 01:36.361
Not that sorry,
don't wake father figure, and

01:36.396 --> 01:39.098
noninvasive operation.
I think that one's missing

01:39.199 --> 01:43.469
a couple organs. I also have
checkers, if you want to take tur...

01:43.570 --> 01:47.239
The sea spire statue.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.108
Pfft! Oh!

01:49.209 --> 01:52.711
- So that's where you left it.
- I...

01:52.779 --> 01:56.381
forgot I still had this.

01:58.251 --> 02:01.754
I ... I'm really sorry I forgot
it on our mission that time.

02:01.821 --> 02:05.191
- Oh, Steven...
- If I'd just remembered to pack it,

02:05.192 --> 02:07.442
then maybe the sea spire
would still be around.

02:07.477 --> 02:09.294
But now it's
gone forever 'cause of me.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.497
Well, yeah, but...

02:11.565 --> 02:14.567
- Don't worry about it, guy.
- You did your best on

02:14.634 --> 02:16.769
that mission, and that's what counts.

02:16.966 --> 02:21.395
But the sea spire!
It was a special, important gem... place.

02:21.506 --> 02:25.517
Oh, Steven, no, no, no.
If the spire had been crucial,

02:25.585 --> 02:27.920
we wouldn't have used
it as a test for you.

02:27.987 --> 02:32.057
- It's fine, really.
- Test?

02:32.125 --> 02:34.927
What do you mean "test"?

02:36.396 --> 02:39.731
Eh... well,
it wasn't really a "test,"

02:39.799 --> 02:42.707
per se, not in the
traditional sense. We just

02:42.708 --> 02:45.804
wanted to see if you were
ready to go on missions.

02:45.872 --> 02:47.973
That's exactly what a test is!

02:48.041 --> 02:50.375
- Eh...
- Steven, it wasn't

02:50.443 --> 02:52.044
something we planned behind your back.

02:52.145 --> 02:57.316
- We just saw an opportunity, an...
- And I failed it.

02:57.383 --> 02:59.685
- I failed the test.
- No way!

02:59.752 --> 03:02.855
- You got at least a 50%.
- Oh! And you had that

03:02.922 --> 03:06.894
raft, so we didn't have to swim home.
That's a solid 75!

03:06.895 --> 03:10.431
Not failing at all!
Besides, that spire

03:10.466 --> 03:11.864
was in much worse shape
than we thought.

03:11.931 --> 03:16.001
- It should've been even easier.
- I failed an easy test?!

03:16.069 --> 03:18.415
Nice one.

03:18.416 --> 03:20.973
- That's not what I meant! I ...
- No!

03:21.040 --> 03:23.642
I need another test ...
a hard one!

03:23.710 --> 03:27.686
- But, Steven, you've come so far.
- Let me prove it!

03:27.764 --> 03:31.261
- Test me! Test me!
- Hmm...

03:31.262 --> 03:33.552
All right, Steven.

03:33.620 --> 03:35.978
We've adjusted the
metaphysical properties of

03:35.979 --> 03:38.490
the temple to create a
customized dungeon for you.

03:38.558 --> 03:41.670
Now just beyond here are
three chambers designed by

03:41.671 --> 03:44.663
each of us to simulate the
challenges of a mission.

03:44.731 --> 03:48.634
Should you succeed, you'll
unlock the final door, where

03:48.701 --> 03:51.103
- we will be waiting for you.
- All right!

03:51.204 --> 03:54.851
- That's more like it.
- Steven, this won't be easy.

03:54.886 --> 03:55.941
Be careful in there.

03:56.009 --> 03:58.710
Right.
I won't let you down this time.

03:58.778 --> 04:01.079
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah!

04:01.147 --> 04:05.050
- Get amped, Steven!
- I'm ready.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.792
Good luck!

04:13.860 --> 04:19.745
You're gonna need it!

04:20.233 --> 04:25.637
Roomer-o uno. I wonder if
Amethyst made this one.

04:25.705 --> 04:29.675
Definitely Amethyst.

The door!

04:48.695 --> 04:52.664
Unh! Whoa!
Unh!

04:52.732 --> 04:55.200
Wha? Uh-oh.
Uh...

04:55.268 --> 04:58.952
Oh.

04:59.973 --> 05:02.975
Yeah!

05:06.879 --> 05:09.921
<i>How do I get up there?</i>

05:12.018 --> 05:15.954
Huh?

05:16.022 --> 05:19.257
Hmm...
Oh! A music puzzle.

05:19.325 --> 05:22.728
Must be Pearl's room.
Only she would make me think.

05:22.795 --> 05:25.664
Okay. Let's see...
um...

05:25.732 --> 05:29.601
Bing.
# bing #

05:29.669 --> 05:32.871
â™ª bing â™ª
â™ª bing â™ª

05:32.939 --> 05:35.741
Did that do it?

05:39.645 --> 05:41.747
Easy!

05:41.848 --> 05:44.082
Not easy!

05:51.591 --> 05:55.127
Whoo-hoo!
That... was close.

05:55.194 --> 05:59.231
That was really close.

05:59.332 --> 06:04.536
All right, let's see what we got.

06:07.273 --> 06:10.542
Looks like Garnet...
turned up the heat.

06:10.643 --> 06:13.178
Nice one, Steven.

06:28.181 --> 06:30.862
Huh?

06:39.739 --> 06:45.077
What?

06:45.144 --> 06:48.647
Oh, no.
It can't be true.

06:57.323 --> 07:00.292
What?!

07:03.629 --> 07:07.732
It didn't even matter?!

07:07.800 --> 07:10.836
This too?!

07:17.777 --> 07:20.501
Everything's rigged!

07:26.018 --> 07:27.919
Ah!

07:50.443 --> 07:54.045
I... can't believe it.

07:54.113 --> 07:58.350
"It won't be easy. Good luck!
You're gonna need it!"

07:58.351 --> 08:01.677
How am I supposed to prove
myself if you guys keep ...

08:01.678 --> 08:03.302
<i>What's taking him so long?</i>

08:03.337 --> 08:05.982
<i>I didn't think mine
was very difficult.</i>

08:06.017 --> 08:07.993
<i>Do you think he hurt himself?</i>

08:08.060 --> 08:11.296
<i>There's no way.
It's impossible for him to fail.</i>

08:11.364 --> 08:13.832
<i>Ugh!
So what's the point?</i>

08:13.900 --> 08:16.101
<i>The point is
that he's come so far.</i>

08:16.169 --> 08:19.100
He can make Rose's
bubble, and he's pulled out

08:19.101 --> 08:22.398
Rose's shield twice.
But he's lost his healing powers.

08:22.433 --> 08:24.950
We have to give him another success.

08:24.985 --> 08:28.680
He can't lose his confidence
like that again.

08:31.050 --> 08:33.251
- We're bad at this.
- What?

08:33.352 --> 08:35.921
Yeah, you can't
control him, and he shouldn't be

08:35.988 --> 08:38.323
taking advice from me,
and we don't have Rose

08:38.390 --> 08:40.692
- to tell us what to do!
- But he needs us to

08:40.760 --> 08:44.152
- show him how to be a gem!
- Steven is not just a gem.

08:44.187 --> 08:47.572
There has never been anything
or anyone like Steven.

08:47.573 --> 08:50.570
We don't know what he needs.

09:38.918 --> 09:40.227
Congratulations.

09:40.228 --> 09:43.221
- Congratulations, Steven!
- Ye-eah!

09:43.289 --> 09:46.825
Congrats, little man!
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

09:46.892 --> 09:50.295
<i>- Yes. Well done.
- Yeah, Steven!</i>

09:50.363 --> 09:53.331
<i>- You did it.
- Hoo!</i>

09:53.399 --> 09:55.400
Hoo! Hoo...

09:55.468 --> 09:57.369
Thank goodness you made it.

09:57.436 --> 10:02.352
- How did it go?
- I can't believe you guys.

10:02.353 --> 10:04.376
That was so...

10:04.443 --> 10:08.413
insane!
Where do I even begin?

10:08.514 --> 10:11.283
Man, you should've seen me!
That boulder was comin' at me,

10:11.350 --> 10:14.185
and I just jumped for it!
And then, the tiles were

10:14.253 --> 10:16.054
going like...
# bing bong bing! #

10:16.155 --> 10:18.423
And I was like,
"I see what's going on here!"

10:18.491 --> 10:20.916
And I thought, "there's no
way I could've been ready

10:20.917 --> 10:23.295
for all that fire and lava
and spikes," but I did it!

10:23.362 --> 10:26.398
I really... did it.

10:26.465 --> 10:29.301
I... you guys are the best.

10:29.368 --> 10:31.903
Thank you so much
for doing this for me.

10:31.971 --> 10:35.073
- This was just what I needed.
- Oh, Steven.

10:35.141 --> 10:37.309
Aww! Shucks, guy!

10:37.376 --> 10:40.378
- Mmm.
- I'm so proud of you.

10:40.446 --> 10:42.891
Yeah! You da man!

10:42.892 --> 10:44.149
I knew you could do It.
