WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:06.718
With the best sports-medicine doctor
in all of Orange County.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.552
My dad really loves me.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.996
- <i>So he's gonna really like you.</i>
- I have to tell you something.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.957
I just want you to know the truth.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.553
I think I'm in love with you.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.075
So, Summer Roberts,
you saved Chrismukkah.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.993
Chrismukkah.
Well, that must be a lot of fun for you.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.673
Yeah, we have fun with it.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:32.800 --> 00:34.074
Nope.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.152
Nope.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.030
Look at the branch spacing.
It's like Swiss cheese.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.430
These stems couldn't hold
heavier ornaments.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.319
- So that's a pass, then?
- Why not? We've been here three hours.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.471
Hey, get in the spirit, man.
It's Chrismukkah.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.471
- And I love Chrismukkah.
- So we've heard.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.915
It's seriously the best thing
I've ever done.

00:58.440 --> 01:01.159
Every Jewish boy wants Christmas.
I gave myself that.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.151
What does every Christian kid want?

01:03.320 --> 01:05.595
- Easy. A bar mitzvah.
- I've never wanted one.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.830
Well, that's just because
you don't know better.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.353
Coop, let's look over here.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.192
- Again?
- Yeah.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.438
Seriously, I think you should
really consider it.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.632
- What, a bar mitzvah?
- Yeah.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.597
You've brought some "Chris"
to the Cohens...

01:21.760 --> 01:23.716
...but I think you could use
a little "mukkah."

01:23.880 --> 01:25.279
I don't think so.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.795
That's tough talk from a guy
who eats a lot of bagels.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.951
Oh, you think Johnny
would like that tree?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.998
Johnny? Johnny who?
"Johnny Harper" Johnny?

01:34.160 --> 01:35.149
Johnny, the one...

01:35.320 --> 01:38.710
...let's-take-time-off-just-be-friends-
because-I'm-in-Iove-with-you Johnny?

01:38.880 --> 01:40.199
It's just, I feel bad.

01:40.360 --> 01:44.672
I mean, it's the holidays,
and he's all alone, laid up with his knee.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.558
I don't know, Cooper Scooper.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.631
That's a bad nickname.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.438
And besides, I already talked about it
with Ryan...

01:50.600 --> 01:52.875
...and he's cool with everything.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.148
- It's just a tree.
- Okay.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.958
But I get to pick it out.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.751
- Everything cool with you and Marissa?
- Yep, we had a really good talk.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.190
- The whole Johnny thing?
- There is no Johnny thing.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.669
I mean, there is, but not for her.
It's the holidays.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.955
I'm sure Johnny's the last thing
on her mind.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.759
Hey. So we found a great tree
for Johnny's house.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.594
Did you, now?

02:13.760 --> 02:15.716
I figured he could use
some holiday cheer.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.598
I think that's a great idea.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.877
And what do you think, Cohen?

02:23.720 --> 02:26.109
My Chrismukkah forecast
calls for trouble.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.869
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Marissa.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.349
If you're looking for Johnny,
it's not the best time.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.318
- Is everything okay?
- Who is it, Ma?

03:17.680 --> 03:19.750
- Hey, guys.
- A little something for the holidays.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.388
It only took Summer five hours
to pick it out.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.312
Thanks. That's really nice of you guys.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.755
- That is nice. Here, let me.
- Yeah.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.112
I'll be inside.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.909
- Well, what's going on?
- Nothing.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.629
- Just... We got a call from the doctor.
- Something wrong with the surgery?

03:39.560 --> 03:41.039
There's not gonna be a surgery.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.074
Apparently, my mom's insurance
doesn't cover it, so...

03:44.240 --> 03:46.231
So he's not gonna do the operation?

03:46.400 --> 03:49.039
He would, if we could pay for it.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.954
So I guess I'm gonna have to get
used to living here a little while longer.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.715
- Sorry, man.
- No, it's cool. You know.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.269
I was kind of getting sick of surfing
anyways.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.432
But thanks for the tree.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.874
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.432
I think he really liked the tree.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.955
Hey. I tell you, the air is crisp.
It must be 70 degrees out there.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.874
- The kids are not back yet with the tree?
- Oh, not yet. Seth said they'll be a while.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.793
I'm just pulling out stockings
and menorahs and yarmul-Claus.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.279
All the Chrismukkah trimmings.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.998
Remember when Seth made him this?

04:24.160 --> 04:25.479
That feels like forever ago.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.236
What feels like forever ago
is when my mom and I made this.

04:30.760 --> 04:35.276
My dad claimed it was his favorite.
Always demanded that he got to hang it.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.589
This is your first holiday without him.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.718
And the last one
with the boys in the house.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.670
Merry Chrismukkah, huh?

04:45.480 --> 04:49.519
Well, luckily Chrismukkah has twice
the resistance of an ordinary holiday.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.789
It's just that this year, it just feels like
it's flying by so fast, Sandy.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.428
And I just feel adrift.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.194
Well, you got your business with Julie.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.271
If you wanna feel better
about your life...

05:01.440 --> 05:03.590
...hanging out with Julie
is a great way to begin.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.592
I should check in on her.
See how she is.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.797
You mark my words.
This will be the best Chrismukkah ever.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.552
You're beginning to sound like Seth.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.871
Well, that just means
you'll miss him less when he's gone.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.274
You guys, we have to do something.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.953
We need a Chrismukkah miracle.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.792
Right. A Chrismukkah miracle.
That's what I do.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.679
Okay, how about if we...? No.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.351
No. What if...?

05:43.080 --> 05:44.593
No. I know.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.473
Stupid.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.436
I can actually see the wheels turning.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.428
- How much can surgery be?
- It's a few grand at least.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.397
If any of you were
even remotely Jewish...

05:55.560 --> 05:58.518
...I would just say we could pool
our bar-mitzvah money, but...

06:00.120 --> 06:01.792
- Holy crap, that's it.
- What's it?

06:02.200 --> 06:04.509
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yes.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.113
- No way, dude.
- Yes way, dude.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.510
- Yes way.
- I'm sorry, all right? I can't. I won't.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.954
- Will.
- I'm not having it.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.712
- Having what?
- A bar mitzvah.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.359
What?

06:13.520 --> 06:15.909
Ryan gets bar mitzvahed.
Now, that is funny.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.514
- See? Summer's laughing.
- That's just gas. Listen.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.399
This won't be an ordinary bar mitzvah.
Know what this will be?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.514
Wait for it. Wait for it.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.832
A Chrismukkah bar mitz-vahkkah.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.638
Spell that, dude.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.119
- That's crazy.
- Yeah?

06:30.280 --> 06:31.998
So crazy it just might work.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.794
So we throw a big party...

06:33.960 --> 06:35.916
And Ryan gets the money
from the bar mitzvah?

06:37.240 --> 06:39.549
And then we can spend it
on Johnny's surgery.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.188
How will it work?
Stand in front of Newport, sing Hebrew?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.839
You chant. And hell, yes.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.719
- What centerpieces should we get?
- I don't know. Band or DJ?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.154
DJ with dancers.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.595
- I like the Pussycat Dolls.
- My God. You're serious.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.433
We can get so many cool things,
Herckel the Jewish clown.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.556
- Herckel?
- DJ Goldsteinberger.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.510
<i>The 21 car will just have</i>
<i>to continue on through the pit.</i>

06:59.680 --> 07:04.390
<i>You can 't make a penalty</i>
<i>and gain by it in terms of...</i>

07:04.560 --> 07:07.916
I told you, Gus.
I'm not going to your Christmas party.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.830
Even if you are deep-frying a ham.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.478
Well, deep-fried ham sounds delicious.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.198
Kirsten.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.595
I thought we weren't doing any business
until after the New Year.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.354
- I didn't come here for business.
- In the neighborhood?

07:24.520 --> 07:25.873
I came to see how you were.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.513
I'm great.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.799
Neighbors are having cockfights
in an hour, using stray dogs.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.393
It's a holiday tradition.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.516
My money's on the feisty Weimaraner.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.592
Good. Because I'm awful.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.436
I'm spitting Skoal into a can, drinking
wine from a bottle I unscrewed...

07:44.600 --> 07:48.434
...and living in a home that,
if I wanted to, I could put in reverse.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.874
I'm beyond awful.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.951
At least spend the holidays
with Marissa?

07:52.120 --> 07:55.635
You know, we were.
But the Four Seasons in Maui is booked.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.719
- Haven't told her?
- What?

07:57.880 --> 08:00.155
That her mom's
now a Jeff Foxworthy fan?

08:00.680 --> 08:04.275
She thinks our new oceanfront condo
is undergoing a remodel.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.832
- Julie, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna let her have her fun.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.877
And I will be miserable.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.671
Well, misery loves company.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.357
<i>Guys, we understand that Dixon</i>
<i>will be in in the next two or three laps.</i>

08:24.520 --> 08:26.988
<i>Hornish maybe in the next four or five.</i>

08:30.080 --> 08:32.150
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.397
Dr. Roberts.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.198
Hello. Hi. How are you?

08:36.360 --> 08:37.679
I'm good, Seth. How are you?

08:37.840 --> 08:41.230
Great. I'm with your daughter,
so how could I not be great?

08:42.440 --> 08:45.955
Plus, the Angels won.
Looking pretty good this year.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.509
Baseball season ended months ago,
Seth.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.796
But the market is up. Yes?

08:52.200 --> 08:54.760
No? It's a good...?
It's a good time for the market?

08:54.920 --> 08:58.469
Yes? No? It's good. It's bad.
It's bad... It's a bad time for the market.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.995
Cohen, why don't you go comb
Princess Sparkle's tail.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.752
- I know that relaxes you.
- What?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.277
Summer, what...?
What are you talking about?

09:05.440 --> 09:06.714
I would never... I would...

09:08.120 --> 09:10.315
- Is the comb where I left it?
- Yeah.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.833
Okay.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.794
How are you, sweetheart?

09:17.960 --> 09:20.269
Good. Just had a trial run
at the Christmas-tree lot.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.431
I helped pick out the Cohens' tree.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.677
Is what's-her-name around?
We could all go later and pick out ours.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.593
Your stepmother? She's out of town.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.035
She's meeting with the maharishi
in New Delhi.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.270
She wants to get centered
for the New Year.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.032
So when she's here, she's not really
here, but now she's really not here?

09:39.480 --> 09:42.790
Well, we have each other.
And I've got a ton of work.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.315
Well, can't tummy tucks wait?
It's the holidays.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.197
Aren't you the least bit bummed
that your wife ditched us?

09:50.360 --> 09:53.670
Well, I'm too busy.
I really haven't had a chance...

09:53.840 --> 09:55.114
...to be bummed.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.118
I've gotta be off to the OR.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.350
When you wanna get that tree,
you just let me know.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.999
Bye, Dad.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.916
<i>Go, Johnny, go.</i>
<i>Johnny boy.</i>

10:08.080 --> 10:09.752
He hasn't moved all day.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.158
Johnny, your friends are here.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.355
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.509
Hey.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.870
This is when me and Chili
went down to Costa Rica.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.838
Was the greatest trip of my life.
Now it's the most depressing.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.197
- Well, we have some good news.
- Yeah? I could use some of that.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.759
Yeah, well, you're gonna have
the surgery.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.309
We're gonna throw a party.
A fundraiser.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.074
We have them all the time,
so it's not really a big deal...

10:31.240 --> 10:33.310
...but everyone in Newport
usually comes.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.358
- We'll raise the money.
- So I'm like a charity case now.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.754
No. It's not like that.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.639
The rich people pay for the poor kid.
How is it not like that?

10:41.800 --> 10:43.074
We're trying to help.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.754
I appreciate that,
but I've always taken care of myself.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.673
Okay. All right.
But now's not the time to be proud.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.390
Hey, man,
if anyone should understand...

10:53.760 --> 10:56.069
Look, thanks,
but no, thanks, all right?

10:56.440 --> 10:58.829
I should probably lay down.
My knee's killing me.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.511
Thanks for stopping by.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.631
I don't care.
Ryan's getting a bar mitzvah.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.358
The whole point was to help Johnny.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.796
Maybe to you, but do any of you
remember my bar mitzvah?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.117
Wait, wasn't that Luke's birthday?

11:25.280 --> 11:27.271
We played paintball.
That was so much fun.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.591
That was fun for the entire 13-year-old
population of Orange County...

11:30.760 --> 11:32.876
...none of whom swung by
Temple Beth-El that day.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.792
But now I'm gonna get a do-over.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.598
I just wish he'd let us help him.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.239
He doesn't wanna be our charity case.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.233
Poor guy. Slight of build
and on crutches.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.436
He's kind of like our very own
Tiny Tim.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.912
He was pretty upset yesterday,
but he'd just gotten the news.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.719
Maybe if he just thinks about it,
it'll change his mind.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.154
- Exactly.
- So it's on.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.834
You guys keep working on it.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.560
All right. Meet you at the diner.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.917
Bye.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.874
We only have one hurdle left
before you become a man.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.912
A bar mitzvah? For Ryan?

12:04.080 --> 12:06.640
It just makes me feel all tingly
hearing you say it.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.351
- You have any idea how offensive this is?
- We're not trying to offend, just help.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.556
Well, you gotta be Jewish
to be bar mitzvahed.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.029
- Let's start there.
- Why are you guys doing this?

12:17.200 --> 12:20.158
Our friend Johnny can't afford surgery.
It's like a fundraiser.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.437
- Which is where we need you, Mom.
- It's a sacred religious event.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.955
A tradition that marks
a Jewish child's obligation...

12:26.120 --> 12:27.758
...to observe the Ten Commandments.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.150
I'm sorry.
And that's the problem with the Jews.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.878
We have no concept of marketing.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.393
- You're on thin ice.
- Listen.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.632
A long time ago, Mom's team allowed
Christmas to be about reindeers...

12:36.800 --> 12:38.472
...and snowmen and Tim Allen movies.

12:38.640 --> 12:42.474
- I'd say that's a pretty religious holiday.
- The birth of Christ? I'd say so.

12:42.640 --> 12:46.952
You betcha. Well, now the bar mitzvah
is our greatest export possibility.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.917
It's got huge crossover potential.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.672
Yeah, it's an honorary bar mitzvah.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.796
It's a Chrismukkah bar mitz-vahkkah.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.393
I like it. And they're helping
their friend.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.516
- But we need your blessing.
- That's right.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.399
The club's throwing a holiday party
anyway. We'll hijack it.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.836
We'll just tell the Newpsies that we're
raising money for the hospital.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.399
Sandy, it could be really fun.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.239
- It's honorary.
- Hey.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.356
- Minimal Hebrew.
- Which I'm fine with.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.114
No tallis. No challah. No tefillin.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.316
As long as people
are dancing to "Y.M.C.A."...

13:17.480 --> 13:19.152
...and handing over cash, we're in.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.118
- Then so are we.
- Mazel tov, buddy.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.317
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Solitaire.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.878
Well, are you winning?

13:37.160 --> 13:40.038
There's nothing worse
than losing to yourself, huh?

13:41.520 --> 13:44.034
- You got some time to talk?
- Actually, I'm kind of busy.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.792
- I can see that.
- No, I'm serious.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.071
What's your problem, Johnny?

13:51.240 --> 13:53.674
You don't want help,
or you don't want help from me?

13:53.840 --> 13:56.070
My problem is my problem.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.954
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.754
I can wait.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.674
It's private.

14:10.320 --> 14:14.074
Hey, man. Actually, it's...
It's not a good time.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.390
You know what? It's fine. I'll go.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.154
Marissa...

14:18.520 --> 14:19.794
...I'm sorry, okay?

14:22.600 --> 14:24.716
Yeah, sure, I can meet you.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.597
I can't believe this is you.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.115
Hard to believe
I was once skinny and awkward, I know.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.430
But seriously,
you went out in public like this?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.558
It's one of the unfortunate truths
of the bar mitzvah, Ryan.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.029
It's the most awkward time
in a Jewish boy's life.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.919
- But also the most photographed.
- Is there a videotape too?

14:44.080 --> 14:46.196
You would have to kill me first. Hey.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.510
My archery award
from Camp Takahoe...

14:48.680 --> 14:51.114
...my clay hot dog I made
in seventh grade...

14:51.280 --> 14:54.556
...my diorama
of <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.</i>

14:54.720 --> 14:56.119
There we go.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.679
This is the CD I trained with.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.470
Rabbi Gutterman. He does a lovely job.
Very easy for you to mimic.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.677
- I don't know if I can do this.
- It'll be over before you know it.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.276
You just chant a little Torah, you dance
a little hora, and then we're golden.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.749
You hear "That's What Friends Are For,"
you're done.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.751
- That song's Jewish?
- It might as well be.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.559
It's a staple of every bar mitzvah.
You and your friends...

15:15.720 --> 15:18.473
...your arms around each other, swaying.
It's awesome.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.596
I thought all the kids
went to Luke's party.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.113
It's hypothetically awesome.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.998
But tomorrow,
we're gonna rewrite history.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.038
I guess I should go study.
Then I gotta meet up with Marissa.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.475
Hey. No slacking with the lady, okay?

15:29.640 --> 15:33.076
You got 24 hours to learn Hebrew,
to read the Old Testament...

15:33.240 --> 15:35.993
And humiliate myself
in front of the whole town.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.879
Better than humiliating yourself
in front of no one. Trust me.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.598
<i>Julie, this is just what we need...</i>

15:40.760 --> 15:43.752
...to lift us out of our holiday blues.
We're throwing a party.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.956
A bar mitz-vahkkah,
which sounds delightful.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.270
Seth is one of a kind.
But how's this gonna work?

15:48.440 --> 15:51.671
We raise money for the hospital,
they throw in an arthroscopic surgery.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.718
- And they're gonna go for that?
- Julie Cooper?

15:56.800 --> 15:58.119
Hi, doctor. Have we met?

15:58.720 --> 16:00.790
I hope so.
Your daughter's living at my house.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.879
- Neil. I didn't even recognize you.
- Hi, Neil. How are you?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.473
I'm good, Kirsten. Busy.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.835
Thank you again
for letting Marissa live with you.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.594
No need to thank me.
I know how unnerving a remodel can be.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.030
Do you know where
the administrator's office is?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.111
Dr. Singh? What do you want
with that crank?

16:15.280 --> 16:17.111
Throwing a fundraiser for the hospital.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.477
He's definitely not the guy to see
about a party. He's in the Bahamas.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.676
- You're kidding.
- But maybe I can help you.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.990
I'm head of Plastic Surgery
and I'm on the board.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.151
Yes, well. It's called
a bar mitz-vahkkah.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.837
<i>I'd like to introduce you</i>
<i>to my father-in-law.</i>

16:34.000 --> 16:36.878
<i>- And here's the Nana, my mother.</i>
<i>- Well, hello.</i>

16:37.040 --> 16:39.679
<i>- My father-in-law, Caleb Nichol.</i>
<i>- Shalom.</i>

16:44.120 --> 16:47.237
<i>Hey, Seth.</i>
<i>Do you wanna dance, sweetheart?</i>

16:47.400 --> 16:49.675
<i>This song is called</i>
<i>"That's What Friends Are For."</i>

16:49.840 --> 16:51.114
<i>It's for your friends.</i>

16:51.280 --> 16:53.953
<i>Well, we're your friends.</i>

16:54.120 --> 16:58.432
<i>This is my funeral, not my bar mitzvah.</i>
<i>No one showed up.</i>

16:58.600 --> 17:00.591
<i>And you said</i>
<i>Summer Roberts was coming.</i>

17:00.760 --> 17:02.955
<i>She R.S. V.P. 'd.</i>

17:03.120 --> 17:04.394
<i>So did a lot of kids.</i>

17:04.560 --> 17:06.391
<i>I hate it here.</i>

17:07.480 --> 17:08.833
<i>- What?</i>
- <i>What's wrong, honey?</i>

17:09.000 --> 17:11.798
<i>My Rapid Palate Expander's killing me.</i>

17:12.640 --> 17:13.914
<i>Buddy.</i>

17:14.480 --> 17:16.596
Hey, Portnoy. How's it going?

17:16.760 --> 17:19.273
I gotta meet Marissa. I'm late.
Lost track of time.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.910
That's the Torah for you. Once you
start unscrolling, it's hard to stop.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.310
- I'm a dead man tomorrow.
- In all seriousness...

17:25.480 --> 17:28.074
...it's great what you're doing,
considering everything.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.639
Maybe they'll make me a saint.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.634
Jews don't believe in saints,
just really good standup comics.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.790
- Can I help you?
- Hey. I'm waiting for someone.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.599
- It'll just be a minute.
- Okay.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.354
Hey, Johnny?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.752
Are you okay?

18:34.160 --> 18:35.479
Not really.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.592
Hey, look, you're gonna get better.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.797
What if I don't? My whole life,
I've dreamt of one thing.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.709
I was so close to making that happen.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.950
It was gonna change my life.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.596
Well, that can still happen.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.756
I'm sorry I've been
taking this out on you.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.832
I know I've made things weird,
but sometimes...

19:10.360 --> 19:14.353
...knowing that you're pulling for me,
it's the only thing that keeps me going.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.832
Hey, we're gonna get through this.
Okay?

19:21.120 --> 19:23.156
We'll get through it together.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.955
- What do you mean, you're not doing it?
- I'm done.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.156
- Did something happen?
- Something's happening.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.038
- Can't it just wait?
- No, it can't.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.474
Johnny's in love with Marissa...

19:52.640 --> 19:54.392
...and she can't seem
to get enough of him.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.790
Sounds like a low-grade
relationship issue brewing.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.428
- Very high-grade. It's level five.
- What's the problem?

19:59.600 --> 20:03.718
There is no problem.
I'm just not humiliating myself tonight.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.834
What, you're quitting?

20:07.720 --> 20:09.039
This is bad news.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.111
Great news. So Neil Roberts
cleared the fundraiser with the board.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.192
Julie and I talked to the Newpsies.
We're all set for tonight.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.679
You were right.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.510
This is gonna be
the best Chrismukkah ever.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.477
I gotta go set up.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.399
That was remarkable timing
by Mom right there.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.757
<i>Oy,</i> humbug.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.272
Well, sweetheart, I have to say,
your mom taught you well.

20:34.280 --> 20:38.319
She used to spend hours picking out
a tree, seeing how dry the pines were.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.357
If it's dry, say goodbye.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.557
- How much sap was on the bark.
- Sticky but critical.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.950
How the tree looked
with your presents underneath.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.476
Anything with presents for me
looks good.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.994
- Dad?
- What, baby?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.394
Why did Mom leave?

20:59.880 --> 21:03.589
Well... I mean, I was only 13 years old.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.032
Your mom...

21:08.960 --> 21:11.190
She just didn't like it here
with me, I guess.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.038
I remember when you told me
the news.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.755
I think that was the worst day
of my life.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.558
And you were already upset...

21:20.720 --> 21:22.870
...because I didn't let you go
to Luke Ward's birthday party.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.316
- Really?
- Yeah. You had already R.S.V.P.'d...

21:25.480 --> 21:26.959
...to some other engagement.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.512
Oh, my God. Yeah.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.470
Not that it mattered. You didn't
come out of your room for three days.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.599
When you found out, you cried.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.436
- But we've done okay?
- Yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.752
Your stepmother,
she's very sweet on you.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.554
That's because she's medicated.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.112
I'm sorry.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.592
- I just miss Mom sometimes.
- I know.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.753
Me too.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.396
I've got rounds. I won't be long.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.959
Okay.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.436
- Seth.
- Dr. Roberts.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.794
Did you see that?
That was a breakthrough moment for us.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.593
Everything okay?

22:22.760 --> 22:26.116
Yeah. Just, the holidays can be hard,
you know?

22:26.280 --> 22:28.111
Yeah, can I help?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.399
You already have.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.432
- Hey. Thanks for meeting me.
- Of course...

22:38.600 --> 22:41.273
...after last night.
You really talked me off the ledge.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.955
Yeah. I kind of wanted
to talk about last night.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.078
- I just feel weird about what happened.
- Nothing happened.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.830
- I mean, well, there was a definite vibe.
- That I like you?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.912
It's not a vibe, it's the truth.
Which I've shared with you.

22:56.080 --> 22:59.072
Unintentionally,
but you still seem to wanna hang out.

22:59.240 --> 23:03.552
I do. I just...
I wanna stay friends.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.439
Can we start over?

23:09.640 --> 23:12.438
Yeah, of course. I just...

23:13.040 --> 23:15.838
I mean, I kind of need to know
that everything's okay with you.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.029
My knee's screwed up,
and I give off a vibe...

23:20.200 --> 23:22.953
...but other than that...
- What were you doing last night?

23:23.120 --> 23:25.475
Because I saw you out here
with this guy, and...

23:25.640 --> 23:30.668
Look, I thought we just made peace.
I told you, I'm taking care of things.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.753
What does that mean?

23:34.920 --> 23:38.390
It means don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.196
Let's just leave it at that, okay?

23:48.520 --> 23:50.750
Hey, kid. You mind turning off the TV?

23:50.920 --> 23:53.434
I don't really feel like talking.

23:53.600 --> 23:57.070
That's good, because I do.
You can listen.

23:58.440 --> 24:02.115
That's right. It's time for the big
Sandy Cohen uplifting speech.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.874
- Look, Sandy, I've got my reasons.
- I'm sure you do.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.235
Like I had mine
when I didn't want you to do this.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.356
- Sorry to let you down.
- It's not just me.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.557
There's also Kirsten.
She has her heart set on it.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.390
And the hospital,
they're all excited about it.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.757
And your friend Johnny, who,
whatever he's done...

24:18.920 --> 24:20.353
...he could really use your help.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.193
You can still have the event.
Just do it without me.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.316
That'd be missing the point.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.193
The thing about a bar mitzvah
is it's about becoming a man.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.157
Not that you aren't one already...

24:30.320 --> 24:32.550
...but if there were a time
for an adult moment, this is it.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.675
Whatever's going on,
set it aside until after tonight.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.389
- I'd really be swallowing my pride.
- I'm not saying it tastes good. But...

24:40.560 --> 24:43.552
Gotta do the right thing.
Yeah. Feels like I do that a lot.

24:43.720 --> 24:47.030
That's because, Ryan Atwood,
you're a mensch.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.308
And after tonight,
I'm gonna tell you what that means.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.913
Gus. Damn it.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.989
What are you doing?
We're supposed to be setting up.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.709
Yeah, right, well. Yeah.
I just felt like telling overdressed...

25:13.880 --> 25:15.632
...oversexed Newpsies
how to hang streamers...

25:15.800 --> 25:18.678
...wasn't gonna make me feel better.
- I thought this was for charity.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.752
Well, of course.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.673
It's just, I feel like the Newpsies
won't get me anymore.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.308
I can't have them over
for Pop-Tarts and cockfights.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.072
You're avoiding Marissa, aren't you?

25:30.040 --> 25:32.508
I had no problem
keeping other secrets from her.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.752
Julie, tell her the truth.
She's your daughter. It's the holidays.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.590
You should be together.

25:39.640 --> 25:44.350
You're right.
I'll go over there this evening and do it.

25:55.240 --> 25:59.791
- I haven't heard from you all day.
- I've been studying. Big night tonight.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.434
I thought we were gonna have dinner
last night.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.517
A lot of Old Testament to cover.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.236
Well, I haven't heard you
use that one before.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.710
- It's probably good, anyway.
- How's that good?

26:11.880 --> 26:14.758
Because if you had shown up,
you might have seen me and Johnny...

26:14.920 --> 26:17.912
...and it might have seemed
like something it wasn't.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.918
I saw you guys.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.675
I have a bad habit
of showing up at the wrong time.

26:25.840 --> 26:30.118
Yeah, well, nothing happened.
I promise. We were just talking.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.477
Looked like more than that.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.194
He's in bad shape.

26:36.040 --> 26:39.828
- I'm worried about him.
- Well, I'm starting to be too.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.391
- What is this thing you have?
- What thing?

26:42.560 --> 26:45.199
Always helping these kinds of guys.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.988
What? The wounded-Ioner types?

26:50.840 --> 26:53.559
Sometimes they turn out
to be good guys.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.198
I don't have feelings for Johnny.
I'm just worried about him.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.796
I think he might
be up to something dangerous.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.599
Johnny doesn't seem
like the dangerous type.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.718
Yeah, well, he's scared.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.550
And desperate.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.551
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know. I mean, dealing drugs?

27:18.920 --> 27:20.638
We're just so close to helping him.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.677
All right. All right, I'll talk to him.

27:29.520 --> 27:33.274
And I'll see you tonight.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.554
So how's Johnny doing?

27:41.080 --> 27:43.878
You know. First his girlfriend,
then the accident.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.395
I just don't know
what he would do without you guys.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.676
That's what friends are for, right?
Is he...?

27:48.840 --> 27:51.559
- Yeah, his room's just down the hall.
- Thanks.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.390
- Johnny? Hey, man.
- Ryan?

27:57.560 --> 28:01.189
- Hey. I'll just be a minute.
- Yeah.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.838
Take your time.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.960
- Hey, man.
- Hey. Sorry to show up unannounced.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.869
- No prob. Is everything cool?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.669
Actually, I'm just trying to...
Trying to get you to come to this party.

28:46.880 --> 28:51.590
- It's not still for me, right?
- No, no. We found a different cause.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.957
I'm getting bar mitzvahed.
You'd have to know Seth better.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.590
Well, thanks for the invite, man,
but I got some stuff to do, so...

28:58.760 --> 29:00.716
It'll be fun. You could use some fun.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.516
- I really can't.
- Sure you can.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.791
Everyone wants to see you.
Whatever you're doing, it can wait, right?

29:11.480 --> 29:13.277
Okay, I just gotta get ready.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.759
- I'll be five minutes.
- Great.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.276
I'm gonna embarrass myself
in front of a lot of people.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.158
Hey, man.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.797
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.553
Look at all them signatures.
Attendance is amazing.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.711
So, Cohen,
no one came to your bar mitzvah?

29:56.160 --> 29:59.311
Not no one. The Nana came.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.994
Rabbi Gutterman swung by
after the ceremony, so...

30:02.160 --> 30:05.470
- That is so sad.
- Well, apparently me in a yarmulke...

30:05.640 --> 30:07.995
...was not as enticing a draw
as Luke in camo pants.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.118
Hey. The photographer has summoned us
for our family photos.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.795
And, Ryan, our orthodontist has offered
to take your braces off for the big day.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.871
Couldn't have done that for me?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.118
- Don't let him out of your sight, okay?
- You're okay with that?

30:24.280 --> 30:27.955
Yeah, well, until I can figure out
what he's up to.

30:36.240 --> 30:40.438
- Julie. Look at you.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.477
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.189
I haven't been here in so many years.
I forgot how majestic your home is.

30:46.360 --> 30:50.035
Well, luckily there are a lot
of aging, vain people in this town.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.796
Is Marissa here?
I was hoping to catch her.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.868
- No, she already left for the event.
- Well...

30:57.040 --> 30:59.952
- Just as well, I suppose.
- Would you like a drink?

31:02.480 --> 31:05.233
I think Marissa's a great girl.
She's very good for Summer.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.834
It gives her an ally in the house
when I'm working.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.310
Well, Marissa wasn't a fan
of my remarriage either.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.836
Hopefully I'll have her out of your hair
soon. Remodel's almost finished.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.272
- The little white lies we tell our kids.
- Excuse me?

31:22.440 --> 31:24.556
I've been telling Summer
everything's great also.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.280
Truth is, I'm looking down the barrel
of divorce two.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.670
- Oh, Neil, I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.718
The way my wife self-medicates,
she could be a pharmacist.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.279
Been miserable for years.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.833
I live in a trailer park.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.951
If only I could say that to Marissa.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.758
Sometimes it's okay
to keep our kids out of harm's way.

31:44.920 --> 31:48.913
I just feel terrible lying to her.
We've come so far.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.914
You're remodeling your life.
It's all about how you slice it.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.672
Yes, well, you are the surgeon.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.436
Do you have any interest in a party?

32:00.720 --> 32:02.790
- It's nice to see you again.
- Ryan.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.996
Over here. Everybody,
eyes right to the lens.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.430
- Terrific.
- Let me show you to your seats.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.113
I was born to usher.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.840
Marissa. Come, join us.
You're practically family.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.274
I think, technically, she is.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.390
Over here, everybody. One, two.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.319
Great. Let's just have one
with the bar-mitzvah boy.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.994
I'll be right back.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.835
How are you,
good people of Newport Beach?

32:51.600 --> 32:55.559
Welcome to the first,
and quite possibly the very last...

32:55.720 --> 33:00.191
...Chrismukkah bar mitz-vahkkah.
A charity event for the Hoag Hospital.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.634
- Johnny's gone.
- What?

33:01.800 --> 33:04.837
Yeah, I lost him.
I don't know how, but he can't be far.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.116
- Okay. All right. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.033
- fundraiser. I hope you find it
entertaining and enlightening.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.431
And if not, we've thrown in a big party
for good measure.

33:13.840 --> 33:17.071
Now, the young man who will soon
become a real man is Ryan Atwood.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.676
I'm sure some of you have heard of him.
None of you have seen him like this.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.912
Let's hear it for Ryan Atwood.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.798
- Go. Do something. You gotta...
- No. No.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.474
I am not reliving this.
Once was horrible enough.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.318
Okay. Come on, stall. Please.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.198
Seth Cohen. Hello.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.794
Ryan...

33:41.960 --> 33:45.396
...forgot his glasses,
so he's going to be right back.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.479
Ryan doesn't wear glasses.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.596
He does when he's reading
from right to left.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.551
And so that is how
I came up with Chrismukkah.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.917
Because you can't have "Chris"
without a little "mukkah."

34:10.320 --> 34:15.235
Who here is familiar
with the story of Hanukkah?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.471
No Red Sea pedestrians?

34:19.920 --> 34:22.992
Okay. Well, today's your lucky day.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.357
Because, Summer Roberts,
will you please join me on-stage?

34:27.080 --> 34:29.310
Summer Roberts.

34:31.159 --> 34:34.038
Summer, can I welcome you
to the stage, please?

34:36.679 --> 34:38.955
She's gonna be portraying
the part of Judah Maccabee.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.759
And Marissa Cooper
will be portraying the miraculous oil.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.150
I hope I didn't give away the ending.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.357
We're closing up.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.231
Hey, man.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.114
Ryan.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.710
- We're closing up.
- Yeah, sorry.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.392
Can I get a pack of Marlboros...

36:41.720 --> 36:43.836
...and a lottery ticket.
I'm feeling lucky.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.998
- Come here.
- What are you doing here?

36:55.160 --> 36:57.469
- I could ask you the same thing.
- I'm handling this.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.632
- Yeah, great plan. I don't see any holes.
- I have no choice.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.712
- You do. Doesn't have to be like this.
- What am I supposed to do?

37:05.000 --> 37:08.197
You said if anyone would understand,
it'd be me. Well, you're right.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.796
So listen. Sometimes
you gotta let the rich people help you.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.953
We'll take care of the surgery.
Let us help.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.516
We should go.
I got a lot of people waiting for me.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.837
- Hey!
- Now, everybody, join in.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.833
- They don't really like our songs.
- Why don't you let Coop and I handle this.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.872
You know what I mean?

37:49.840 --> 37:51.353
Ready?

38:06.160 --> 38:07.878
Thank God.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.595
Our bar-mitzvah boy is here.
Ryan Atwood.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.597
- Where were you?
- I think figuring out what a mensch is.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.478
- They're all yours.
- Thanks.

38:23.600 --> 38:28.230
Okay. Sorry to keep
you guys waiting. So.

38:29.840 --> 38:34.152
We are all gathered here
for an honorary bar mitzvah.

38:34.320 --> 38:37.073
But I wouldn't be here at all...

38:37.240 --> 38:40.630
...if it weren't for a mitzvah
the Cohens performed for me.

38:40.800 --> 38:45.112
You see, "mitzvah" means
any act of human kindness...

38:46.880 --> 38:49.440
...and, well, that's really
what we're here to celebrate.

38:52.280 --> 38:57.195
So if you'd open your programs
and turn to page two...

38:59.280 --> 39:01.236
- Mazel tov, kid.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.834
- Come here. Come here.
- We're so proud.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.719
- You're finally a man now.
- And they're playing your song.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.030
- Yeah.
- Cohen.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.192
I think that I've owed you
this dance for like five years.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.593
Well, better late than never.
Ryan, this is a song about friendship.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.558
I'll see you out there. All right?

39:25.760 --> 39:27.034
Excuse me.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.312
Excuse me a second. Hey.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.198
This is the moment
Seth's been waiting for.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.158
- Finally has some friends.
- Sure.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.155
Oh, hang on.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.952
Friends?

39:44.880 --> 39:46.438
Friends.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.754
Hey.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.433
Hey.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.470
- Hi.
- Hey. Join our circle.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.792
Actually, this is kind of lame.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.351
Hey. Sorry.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.431
- Hi.
- Hi, Kirsten, you look lovely.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.431
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you. Sandy.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.919
- Doctor.
- Good to see you.

40:12.080 --> 40:16.949
- Dad. Hey, what are you doing here?
- It's the holidays. I needed a break.

40:17.120 --> 40:21.875
- Well, come dance with us.
- All right. Excuse me.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.513
- Hey.
- Dr. Roberts. Shalom.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.240
- Shalom.
- Friends?

40:37.400 --> 40:40.392
- Friends.
- Marissa.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.472
- Hey.
- Hey. I come in peace.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.518
