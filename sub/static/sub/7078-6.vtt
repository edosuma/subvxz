00:01.126 --> 00:04.421
Save Greendale Committee,
please welcome our newest member...

00:04.713 --> 00:06.507
math teacher Ben Chang.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.679
Okay, let's get serious.

00:12.971 --> 00:16.767
I've compiled a short list of the most
immediate Greendale emergencies.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.061
Is deforestation on the list?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.688
I, for one, am glad
that this is happening.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.399
What this school needs
is a band of heroes.

00:24.691 --> 00:29.988
Champions willing to rise up and
"Get all those potatoes out of the gym."

00:30.280 --> 00:33.242
Like House Vogadash in the HBO
series, Bloodlines of Conquest.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.952
- Oh, yeah.
- My show right there.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.828
That is a good show.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.040
They really get the incest right.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.085
What the hell is
Bloodlines of Conquest?

00:43.377 --> 00:45.712
Medieval fantasy
based on these books nobody read.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.590
It's great. It's got betrayal, boobs,
espionage, dragons.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.177
Oh, wait, dragons? Is that a spoiler?
I just started season one.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.845
I don't start watching shows...

00:54.137 --> 00:57.015
until they're so popular,
watching is no longer a statement.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.644
You're behind, so we have to live
in a world where there's no dragons?

01:00.936 --> 01:03.522
Do we have to pretend
that Lord Stevarios is still alive?

01:03.814 --> 01:07.109
Thanks, Abed. How about I buy
all the Bloodlines of Conquest books...

01:07.401 --> 01:09.820
read ahead, and spoil
the whole series for you?

01:10.112 --> 01:13.365
- An insane person would do that.
- Knuckleheads, focus.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.827
Item one, the Greendale student census
is out of date.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.454
Britta, Abed,
why don't you partner up on that one?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.456
Give you a chance to squash this beef.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.335
Next, midterm dance is tonight. Who'd
like to be on the decorating committee?

01:25.627 --> 01:27.337
- No.
- Fine. I'll do it.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.632
- I will be on that committee.
- Me too.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.927
Are you guys volunteering
because I'll do all the work?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.262
- I wouldn't.
- Not at all.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.222
I don't care enough to lie, so no.

01:37.514 --> 01:41.143
I will reward that honesty
by giving you something easy.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.396
A bulletin board fell down in
the cafeteria a couple months ago.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.482
- Think you can get it hung back up?
- I'll give it a drive-by.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.319
Great. We have now completed
our first task:

01:50.611 --> 01:52.112
Have a productive meeting.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.239
For every task that we complete...

01:54.531 --> 01:57.326
a star goes on the task wall.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.537
Oh, no.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.875
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

02:05.167 --> 02:08.252
♪ Give me the hope
To run out of steam ♪

02:08.544 --> 02:11.381
♪ Somebody said It can be here ♪

02:11.673 --> 02:15.594
♪ We could be roped up
Tied up dead in a year ♪

02:15.886 --> 02:20.390
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

02:20.682 --> 02:24.645
♪ One by one they all
Just fade away ♪

02:29.107 --> 02:30.484
Yeah.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.819
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.075
Brince Ironstone's daughter
is his mother!

02:40.202 --> 02:44.164
Brince Ironstone's daughter
is his mother!

02:46.750 --> 02:48.377
Hi, there.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.060 --> 03:08.271
- What can I do for you?
- Get me a drill, screws, bulletin board?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.607
- No, I cannot.
- Okay, I tried. Bye.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.318
If you wanna hang a bulletin board,
get a work order.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.986
They're more powerful than you?

03:15.612 --> 03:18.907
I'm taking census. Fill out this form,
but don't talk. I can't hear.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.578
Are you deaf? But you read lips?

03:26.498 --> 03:27.749
Gibberish. You're good.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.837
I wish I knew sign language.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.676
Are you gonna have another
intense burst of compatibility...

03:37.968 --> 03:40.429
- with a girl we never see again?
- I can't hear you.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.018
The midterm dance
will need a visual theme...

03:47.310 --> 03:50.397
like "Let's Blow Off Steam,"
and it's trains.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.899
- I have an idea.
- Your last idea was to murder.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.068
Edison, the bulletin board's a no-go.

03:55.360 --> 04:01.950
Really? So you did your best
and this task just eludes you?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.579
I have a lifetime of experience with
red tape. I know when to walk away.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.998
- Yeah, you do.
- Hey, Edison.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.668
The system is lazy. I have integrity,
too much to deal with any of it.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.005
- I'll do it myself.
- And I would love to watch you try.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.423
Okay. I am on bulletin board duty.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.927
You guys are in charge of the dance.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.851
Oh, Professor Pushpin.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.687
Jerry, Carlo, Crazy Schmidt. I'm Annie.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.355
- You learned our names.
- I did.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.025
Crazy Schmidt,
how are C.J.'s clarinet lessons going?

04:36.943 --> 04:38.695
Well, she's having a little trouble...

04:38.987 --> 04:41.490
with her left finger lifts,
but she's getting there.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.950
Annie, do you want
that bulletin board hung up?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.620
Let me put in a work order for you.

04:49.581 --> 04:53.585
There you go. That should happen
in three to six business months.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.297
Any way we could
bump that up a little...

04:57.589 --> 05:00.550
so it's somewhere above
"Lower flag for Reagan's death"?

05:00.842 --> 05:03.720
- Talk to a custodian. We're janitors.
- There's a difference?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.598
We were just starting to like you.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.017
- Had enough?
- I'm just getting started.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.186
What was your stumbling block,
being nice?

05:11.478 --> 05:14.397
Look, I admire your idealism,
but my guess is...

05:14.689 --> 05:18.652
that you will be crying uncle
before that board ever goes up.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.654
Game on, baby.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.328
Come on. Come on.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.251
What? God.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.005
This isn't over.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.682
Here we go. You wanted to get dirty.
This is where it starts.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.645
Deputy Custodian Lapari...

05:53.937 --> 05:57.232
Annie Edison from Save Greendale
Committee. How's your daughter's...?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.735
Sorry, this is a closed function.
We don't discuss business at mixers.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.822
- But your daughter, soccer...
- Soccer. Yes. Thanks for coming.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.700
Get a load of that wood burnt sign.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.787
Did Mr. Whitney in Woodshop
make that for you guys?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.831
Yes, that is a Whitney original.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.793
You know, I noticed that Whitney's
bathroom has this amazing toilet.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.462
Flushes like a DC-10 turbine.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.132
Probably exceeds code.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.802
But what's wrong with a little
friendship between departments?

06:26.303 --> 06:28.722
Now, how can our committee
be your friend?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.311
- Bob?
- Excuse me.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.731
Chief Custodian Bob Waite,
Buzz Hickey, Annie Edison.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.318
Hickey and Edison,
something in the job queue.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.237
- Bulletin board.
- Yeah. We were hoping to get that up...

06:45.280 --> 06:46.865
- Let's take a walk.
- Quite a spread.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.825
- I'm impressed.
- It's election time.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.412
If I don't break out sausages, my ass
goes in the grinder next January.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.956
Keeping my people happy.
It's an uphill battle.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.875
For example, look at this.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.253
A lot of the websites we try and visit...

07:00.545 --> 07:04.925
get blocked by this weird filter thing.
Say I wanted to move a work order...

07:05.216 --> 07:08.178
for a bulletin board from
the bottom of the queue to the top.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.804
Now, how can I do that...

07:10.096 --> 07:13.516
when I'm dealing with this?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.102
They want their porn unblocked.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.980
- Then they'll give you your board.
- That's what that was?

07:19.272 --> 07:22.484
How did you know? Did you investigate
pornography when you were a cop?

07:22.776 --> 07:23.777
Something like that.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.112
- He wants a bribe.
- Welcome to the labyrinth.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.950
Only there ain't no puppets
or bisexual rock stars down here.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.661
So at the centre of it all,
if you're lucky...

07:32.953 --> 07:36.289
a piece of cork and a few pins.
So, what, is it worth it?

07:36.581 --> 07:40.001
Is that all a bulletin board is?
A piece of cork? That's not what it is...

07:40.293 --> 07:43.213
to people that lose their pets,
people that need rides...

07:43.505 --> 07:46.466
people whose bad bands
need bad bass players.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.886
To them, every pushpin
has the power to change the future.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.722
So, yes, professor, it's worth it.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.976
I know a lady in the IT Department.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.794
Okay, I'll put some food on the tables,
dim the lights, that's a midterm dance.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.008
I guess it could use
a little something theme-wise.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.135
I have an idea.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.640
"Bear Down For Midterms."

08:38.101 --> 08:41.604
- What?
- "Bear Down For Midterms."

08:41.895 --> 08:44.941
You can't just repeat it.
You need to explain yourself.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.863
It's midterm time.
People have to "bear down"...

08:50.155 --> 08:51.823
study hard, get to work.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.201
It's "Bear Down For Midterms."

08:55.493 --> 08:57.203
Is there a dot I'm not connecting?

08:57.495 --> 08:59.831
It's a play on words.
"Bear down" is an expression.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.958
I know the expression, Chang.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.961
"Fly on the wall" is an expression,
but if I were to pitch:

09:05.253 --> 09:09.632
"Fly On The Wall For Midterms,"
you might ask, "What do you mean?"

09:12.635 --> 09:13.887
Chang?

09:14.804 --> 09:15.847
Are you crying?

09:16.347 --> 09:19.476
I understand I've been crazy
in the past...

09:19.768 --> 09:22.979
but it doesn't make it less frustrating
to be dismissed like this.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.482
I don't know if you guys
see me as human anymore.

09:25.774 --> 09:29.360
I don't know if it's like a joke to you.
Are all Asian men like a joke?

09:29.652 --> 09:30.652
- A racial thing?
- No.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.573
- No. No.
- I paid for my crimes.

09:33.865 --> 09:38.119
Underneath all the craziness,
I am still a human, and I...

09:38.411 --> 09:40.747
I do wanna make a difference.

09:41.039 --> 09:45.043
And can you respect that? Please?

09:46.503 --> 09:49.881
Chang, what can we do here?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.092
"Bear Down For Midterms."

09:52.383 --> 09:53.718
- Okay.
- Okay, well...

09:54.010 --> 09:55.512
We'll put up some bear things?

09:55.804 --> 09:59.390
We'll bear down. For midterms.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.682
Okay.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.937
You want me to lift web restrictions
solely for Custodial?

10:04.229 --> 10:08.274
They need to have full access
so they can research custodian stuff.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.819
If the filter is mistakenly
blocking a site...

10:11.111 --> 10:13.279
they just need to submit the URL
and I can...

10:13.571 --> 10:15.615
- Okay. What do you want?
- Excuse me?

10:15.907 --> 10:18.409
Tell us what we can do,
so that you can do this for us.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.621
Oh, cool.
I didn't know it could work that way.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.581
I guess I could use decent parking.

10:23.873 --> 10:29.087
Right now they make me park
in Annex B like a lunch lady.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.131
Our committee can talk to Parking.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.300
Let's be clear. I want everything
to get through that blocker.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.304
- What do you mean everything?
- Everything!

10:39.097 --> 10:40.640
Understood.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.436
I'm very happy right now.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.397
- So just, bears everywhere?
- Yep.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.234
And then we'll have some cakes,
party hats.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.821
Birthday stuff. This is coming together
better than I thought.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.115
I'm sorry, birthday stuff?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.992
- Yes, Duncan.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.994
Birthday stuff.

11:01.286 --> 11:05.123
Well, I've been sad to see that bulletin
board down in the cafeteria for so long.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.041
Always had a passion for bulletins.

11:07.333 --> 11:11.254
If parking for the IT guy puts
that board back where it belongs...

11:11.546 --> 11:13.089
I won't stand in the way.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.300
You need,
speaking as a fan of bulletins...

11:15.592 --> 11:18.052
to have the dean appoint
someone to oversee them...

11:18.344 --> 11:21.431
to make sure they
stay organised and protected. I'll do it.

11:21.723 --> 11:25.185
- We could look into that.
- Well, not to be that guy...

11:28.146 --> 11:30.481
but could you look into that
before I do this?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.359
You wanna control all bulletin boards
in the school. Why?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.820
You might wanna start talking turkey,
Waldron...

11:36.112 --> 11:39.073
the Macy's Parade is almost over
and Grandma's getting drunk.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.326
Know where my department's power
comes from?

11:41.618 --> 11:43.244
- Parking spaces.
- Wrong.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.997
There was plenty of space to park
in dinosaur times...

11:46.289 --> 11:48.708
but not one single
Parking Department.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.044
My power comes
from a scarcity of parking...

11:51.336 --> 11:53.796
just like your dad's comes
from a lack of hugs.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.716
And you know what takes
my power away? Carpools.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.677
Carpools organised
through rideshares.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.972
Rideshares posted on bulletin boards,
you son of...

12:03.264 --> 12:05.600
Take the books off your head,
we're done posturing.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.228
You want me to talk turkey,
well, gobble, gobble...

12:08.519 --> 12:09.938
I want rideshares gone.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.440
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.234
- What?
- I'll talk to the dean.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.960
I must say, I don't know what we did,
but we sure did it.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.837
I guess the key to dance decoration
is just pick an idea.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.507
And bear down. Right, buddy?

12:37.799 --> 12:40.760
Here are your sodas. Oh, my God.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.012
- Yeah. Pretty great.
- Yeah. Bear down, baby.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.889
Too soon, you guys.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.391
This is way too soon.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.393
- Too soon for what?
- Too soon for this.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.144
After this morning in Wisconsin?

12:51.437 --> 12:54.148
Bear breaks loose at kid's party,
mauls a bunch of people.

12:54.440 --> 12:59.404
Why am I explaining this when this
is obviously a ghoulish reference to it?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.739
The news has been
covering it all morning!

13:05.910 --> 13:07.704
That's where I got the idea.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.373
Sometimes you hear something,
forget you heard it...

13:10.665 --> 13:13.751
but you think you came up with...
Oh, man, this is bad.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.379
We're in crisis mode now.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.923
We really messed up, you guys.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.802
"An Office of Bulletin Board
Oversight."

13:23.094 --> 13:25.805
What a novel idea.
I'm gonna fill out this form right away.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.141
But first, a toast...

13:28.433 --> 13:29.892
to hanging a bulletin board.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.895
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.401
First time toasting? Get in here, buddy.
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.

13:38.693 --> 13:39.693
I'm not saying that.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.865
Oh, well, I hate to be that guy...

13:44.157 --> 13:47.869
but I'm not signing this form
until Professor Hickey says:

13:48.161 --> 13:49.996
"Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy."

13:50.288 --> 13:52.498
Damn it, Annie. Don't do this.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.584
Whatever you've got in your butt...

13:54.876 --> 13:56.210
can we get it out later?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.588
When, after he signs it?
After it's too late?

13:58.880 --> 14:01.341
- Annie?
- You petty old man.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.427
When we started, I thought
you'd get a taste of the system...

14:04.719 --> 14:07.180
and spit it out,
not open a bottling plant.

14:07.472 --> 14:11.059
- You're just like all the people that...
- What? The people that put you here?

14:11.351 --> 14:14.645
The people in the big machine
that made you fail?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.482
You went from being a cop
to teaching criminology...

14:17.774 --> 14:19.192
because of the system, right?

14:19.484 --> 14:22.904
Unfortunately for Greendale, you have
to prove it by getting nothing done.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.405
Here's a bulletin for you:

14:24.697 --> 14:28.785
Annie Edison
doesn't get nothing done.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.620
Where should I put that bulletin?

14:30.912 --> 14:33.956
On a sham piece of cork
controlled by a Parking guy...

14:34.248 --> 14:36.876
that lights his cigars
on student rideshares?

14:38.169 --> 14:40.380
My God, Annie.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.423
What kind of labyrinth
have you created?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.676
Certainly not the magic kind
with puppets and macho rock stars.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.055
You whored yourself out, kid.
You wanted that board so bad...

14:49.347 --> 14:51.307
you made every board
on campus worthless.

14:51.599 --> 14:54.769
And in doing so,
made the school just a shade dirtier.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.815
I thought better of you, young lady.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.485
Oh, man, this got Sorkin-y.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.488
Yeah, well, I didn't think anything
in particular of you...

15:05.780 --> 15:07.990
and now I see why!

15:09.158 --> 15:14.414
Okay, I didn't follow most of that,
but it feels like I ought to do this:

15:22.213 --> 15:23.923
Oh, hey, Annie.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.466
What do you think?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.719
"Fat Dog For Midterms"?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.096
- Yeah.
- Pretty cool.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.348
- I don't understand.
- That's an expression.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.601
"Fat Dog For Midterms."
Like, "Don't sweat it. Fat dog it.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.480
- "Hang out, relax, like a fat dog."
- Look it up on Wikipedia.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.524
- There's an entry in there.
- Yep.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.861
I never... Okay, I just...

15:45.153 --> 15:47.363
- I feel like I'm missing...
- You know, Annie...

15:48.531 --> 15:52.452
sometimes it feels like
you don't take us seriously.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.621
We bring it on ourselves,
but it's still pretty frustrating.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.124
- Annie, is this a race thing?
- Race.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.376
No! God, no.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.629
You guys.
I accept that it's an expression.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.339
But I don't see the connection...

16:05.631 --> 16:07.884
You're over-thinking, Annie.
It's decorating.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.803
Just pick an idea and bear down on it.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.222
Really poor choice of words, Ben.
Too soon.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.600
You guys are right. I'm sorry.

16:15.892 --> 16:21.481
I've had a really hard day.
I need to just fat dog this concept.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.399
- Fat dog.
- Fat dog it, baby.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.068
- Right.
- This will be perfect.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.353
Thank you.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.692
I'm sorry, Abed,
but to the spoiler goes the victory.

17:06.983 --> 17:07.984
But I really liked her.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.195
She likes you too,
but she also likes cash.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.073
I'm devastated.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.825
Now I feel bad.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.494
But you learned a lesson...

17:17.787 --> 17:20.289
and I gave
a differently-abled person a job.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.169
Oh, no. Now I really feel bad.
Wait, no. Come back.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.005
Let's be fat dogs about this.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.305
Hello. What happened to you?

17:36.597 --> 17:38.891
- Nothing. You never called.
- I'm sorry.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.395
The year of the gas leak,
but I won't use that as an excuse.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.147
I can be inconsiderate
and a lot of other things.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.693
Me too.
I guess I could've put in some effort.

17:48.985 --> 17:54.198
- Do you want to go to lunch sometime?
- No. I'd like to go to dinner. Now.

17:54.699 --> 17:55.699
I can do that.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.911
I started this coat check
without permission anyway.

It's called The Fat Dog
And it will amaze.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.118
You've heard this expression
Your entire life.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.328
It's not made up
It's not made up.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.789
There's a brand-new dance
Based on an old phrase.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.958
It's called The Fat Dog

20:09.250 --> 20:10.584
You've heard this expression...

20:10.876 --> 20:13.838
It's a bear dance!

20:22.346 --> 20:23.973
Damn it.
