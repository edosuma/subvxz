00:00.013 --> 00:01.935
<i>Previously on "The Fosters"... </i>

00:01.960 --> 00:04.363
What do you want me to say?
I didn't take the truck.

00:04.365 --> 00:06.530
I checked his prints. They don't
match the ones on the steering wheel.

00:06.564 --> 00:09.166
Stef: I saw the two of
you kiss after the party.

00:09.201 --> 00:12.035
The only way to protect everyone
is to separate you and A.J.

00:12.070 --> 00:14.070
I'm wondering why you felt the need

00:14.105 --> 00:16.974
to take out a restraining
order against Brandon.

00:17.009 --> 00:20.042
- Stef: That was expunged.
- I can't make a recommendation on her adoption

00:20.079 --> 00:21.978
until I investigate this further.

00:22.030 --> 00:25.882
While I am, it's not appropriate
for Callie to be in your care.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.638
You look amazing.

00:31.673 --> 00:33.740
Stop saying that. Really, stop.

00:33.776 --> 00:36.292
Look, these earrings... too much, right?

00:36.295 --> 00:38.478
- Yes?
- Yeah, maybe something a little smaller.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.213
- Yeah, smaller would be better.
- Hoops? No.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.499
Oh, wait. Try these here.

00:42.551 --> 00:45.284
Oh, jeez, I can't even
believe I'm going on this date

00:45.320 --> 00:48.005
and leaving you here alone. There's
something really wrong with that.

00:48.057 --> 00:49.939
I'll be fine, all right?
You're just nervous.

00:49.991 --> 00:51.975
I'm not nervous. I'm terrified.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.877
I haven't been on a date

00:53.963 --> 00:55.911
since the Bush
administration... the first one.

00:55.948 --> 00:57.881
"Don't go blowing something
up that could be great

00:57.915 --> 00:59.783
just because you're
scared." You told me that.

00:59.817 --> 01:00.951
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

01:00.985 --> 01:02.886
I'm gonna start listening to me.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.921
All right, there. Studs, yes?

01:04.956 --> 01:07.524
- Definitely studs.
- Fantastic.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.493
Okay, so, Brandon,
tomorrow the social worker

01:10.495 --> 01:12.429
is going to interview
you and Callie separately.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.430
- What am I supposed to say?
- Well, the truth...

01:14.465 --> 01:16.533
that after the restraining
order you didn't see Callie

01:16.567 --> 01:18.402
until we brought her
home from Girls United.

01:18.436 --> 01:20.236
And that you've had a
strictly brother-and-sister,

01:20.289 --> 01:21.638
platonic relationship ever since.

01:21.674 --> 01:24.408
So then all of this will be
over and Callie can come home?

01:24.442 --> 01:26.209
And that idiot judge will let us adopt her?

01:26.260 --> 01:29.146
Yeah, that's the plan. A.J., I
spoke with your probation officer.

01:29.198 --> 01:31.081
And he wants to meet with you tomorrow.

01:31.115 --> 01:32.948
You told him I didn't steal any car, right?

01:32.984 --> 01:34.266
Yeah, absolutely. I
explained the whole mess.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.186
It's just that Mike has a foster care class

01:36.237 --> 01:38.789
tomorrow all day, so I'm gonna take you.

01:38.790 --> 01:41.792
And what are doing about finding that
douchebag that sold us a stolen car?

01:41.826 --> 01:43.694
- Mariana.
- I'm gonna ask Captain Roberts

01:43.746 --> 01:45.846
- to put a robbery detective on the case.
- Really?

01:45.881 --> 01:48.799
- No.
- We're out, like, $1400.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.700
Got what you deserved, if you ask me.

01:50.753 --> 01:52.536
Well, I didn't ask you.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.638
And now you have to share your
car with us, so you lose too.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.424
Even if we did catch the guy,
you know, I seriously doubt

01:57.459 --> 01:59.543
that you're ever gonna see a
penny of that money again, love.

01:59.545 --> 02:01.260
What, so he gets away with it,

02:01.313 --> 02:03.280
just like that guy with the
hit-and-run that almost killed us?

02:03.281 --> 02:05.382
Oh, but we didn't die, so I guess
that's not a priority either.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.151
- Hey.
- Your mom has worked very, very hard

02:08.187 --> 02:10.235
to try to find the person
responsible for that, Mariana.

02:10.288 --> 02:13.223
Unfortunately, justice is not
always served in this world.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.324
Yeah, just ask Callie.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.210
Okay, listen. I know that this is

02:17.262 --> 02:19.930
very upsetting for all of us,

02:19.965 --> 02:22.164
but this is simply a temporary setback.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.002
Callie's gonna be back home very soon.

02:26.038 --> 02:29.522
And for now, she's safe
and sound at Rita's, okay?

02:35.447 --> 02:37.646
(Doorbell rings)

02:42.487 --> 02:43.569
Who is it?

02:43.622 --> 02:45.454
It's Chloe. Is Rita home?

02:50.162 --> 02:52.179
I'm sorry, she's not here.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.030
Who are you?

02:54.066 --> 02:56.832
Oh, I'm Callie. I'm staying
with Rita. But she went out.

02:56.835 --> 02:58.935
When will she be back?

02:58.971 --> 03:01.705
I'm not sure. She's kind of on a date.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.038
A date? Really?

03:03.040 --> 03:05.641
Well, that's not gonna last very long.

03:05.661 --> 03:07.711
Do you mind if I wait inside?

03:08.980 --> 03:10.813
It's okay. I'm her daughter.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.616
Oh. Yeah, of course. Come in.

03:17.438 --> 03:18.655
Hmm.

03:20.459 --> 03:22.292
Well, that's new.

03:22.311 --> 03:24.661
So how do you know my mother?

03:24.695 --> 03:28.548
Um, I was in Girls
United for a little while.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.067
Oh, you're one of her lost girls?

03:31.068 --> 03:33.370
Well, she's just
fostering me for a few days

03:33.405 --> 03:36.239
until my regular foster parents
get their license renewed.

03:36.275 --> 03:38.040
What happened to their license?

03:38.075 --> 03:39.241
Did they do something wrong?

03:39.243 --> 03:40.944
No.

03:40.978 --> 03:42.145
I kind of did.

03:42.146 --> 03:43.780
- Drugs?
- No.

03:43.816 --> 03:45.164
Boys?

03:45.216 --> 03:48.018
A hottie like you... I
bet it was a boy, right?

03:49.921 --> 03:52.989
Um, maybe I should call Rita,
let her know you're waiting.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.408
I'll do it.

03:56.495 --> 03:58.461
There.

03:58.497 --> 03:59.829
Forewarned.

03:59.831 --> 04:01.580
You mind if I use the bathroom?

04:01.633 --> 04:03.582
- Thanks.
- No, of course.

Well, I guess she's not
coming, so I'm gonna go.

04:53.552 --> 04:55.418
Oh, okay. Well, it was nice to meet you.

04:55.437 --> 04:57.853
Well, that was a bust.

04:57.889 --> 04:59.555
Hi, Mom.

05:01.442 --> 05:03.392
What are you doing here?

05:03.444 --> 05:06.446
Just getting to know my new foster sister.

05:09.735 --> 05:11.617
I'm not gonna give you any money.

05:11.653 --> 05:14.704
Okay, first of all,

05:14.740 --> 05:17.507
I'm not here to ask you
to give me any money.

05:17.543 --> 05:20.576
I'm here to offer you
an opportunity to invest.

05:20.579 --> 05:22.745
- It's a sure thing.
- What is it this time?

05:22.798 --> 05:24.630
A food truck. The guy who owns it

05:24.665 --> 05:26.499
is upside down and he needs cash fast.

05:26.552 --> 05:28.468
I mean, he's practically giving it away.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.718
And food trucks are all the rage right now.

05:29.754 --> 05:31.805
I mean, these guys are
making money hand over fist.

05:31.839 --> 05:33.807
Really? So why is he selling it?

05:33.841 --> 05:35.692
Because he mismanaged.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.826
And you're gonna fix that?
You don't know anything

05:37.862 --> 05:39.728
about the food business.
You don't even cook.

05:41.933 --> 05:44.433
Why can't you ever believe in me?

05:44.485 --> 05:46.702
I have believed in you, Chloe,

05:46.737 --> 05:49.773
to the tune of tens of
thousands of dollars,

05:49.841 --> 05:52.858
all of which you wasted.

05:52.911 --> 05:55.495
Because you sabotage everything that I do.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.663
Are you off your medication?

05:57.699 --> 05:59.865
Oh, here we go.

05:59.918 --> 06:03.586
Whenever I have any legitimate feelings,

06:03.622 --> 06:05.422
I must be off my meds.

06:05.456 --> 06:07.706
You just want me checked
out so I don't have to feel

06:07.759 --> 06:09.675
the pain that you caused me.

06:09.711 --> 06:12.428
Okay, listen, I do not want to do this.

06:13.865 --> 06:16.600
Too bad I'm not a juvenile delinquent.

06:16.634 --> 06:18.468
You need to go now.

06:21.473 --> 06:24.473
Oh, wait. Callie, was it?

06:24.475 --> 06:26.475
Let me tell you something about my mother

06:26.528 --> 06:29.446
Saint Rita, savior of lost souls,

06:29.480 --> 06:32.731
as long you aren't her own daughter.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.867
Thanks again for nothing, Mom.

06:42.494 --> 06:44.461
I just can't believe we're in the same boat

06:44.495 --> 06:45.795
with Callie again.

06:45.831 --> 06:47.797
I know she's fine with Rita,

06:47.832 --> 06:49.798
but I just can't help feeling
like this is all our fault.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.634
You mean my fault?

06:51.670 --> 06:54.553
What? You told me not to
get the restraining order.

06:54.988 --> 06:56.840
I had it expunged.

06:56.891 --> 06:59.475
I never thought about paper copies

06:59.511 --> 07:00.843
lingering in some social worker's file.

07:00.846 --> 07:02.595
- Well, why would you?
- Because I should have.

07:02.648 --> 07:04.613
I should have, Lena.

07:04.649 --> 07:06.716
It's all gonna be all right.

07:10.656 --> 07:12.822
So, honey, we need to
schedule therapy for the week.

07:12.858 --> 07:14.774
Is Friday okay for you?

07:14.826 --> 07:16.860
Can we skip a week?

07:16.976 --> 07:19.593
We just... we have so much going on.

07:19.596 --> 07:21.678
We always have a lot going on.

07:21.731 --> 07:23.680
Okay, well, I cannot focus on us

07:23.733 --> 07:25.766
until we get our daughter back. I'm sorry.

07:28.672 --> 07:31.538
Okay, I'll let Dr. Melvoy know.

07:31.574 --> 07:33.490
Okay.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:50.326 --> 07:52.293
A restraining order, huh?

07:52.329 --> 07:54.129
What, were you, like, stalking her?

07:54.163 --> 07:55.896
No.

07:55.932 --> 07:58.098
Not that it's any of your business.

07:58.134 --> 08:00.851
Yo, what's your beef with me, huh?

08:00.903 --> 08:03.704
I came clean about talking to my
brother, and taking your dumb baseball.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.574
Yeah, after I caught you. Doesn't
change the fact that you lied.

08:06.610 --> 08:07.875
Oh, you never lie?

08:07.911 --> 08:09.793
You never took something that wasn't yours?

08:14.701 --> 08:17.351
You're not even gonna
try to get along with him?

08:17.387 --> 08:19.254
He's not gonna be here much longer.

08:19.288 --> 08:21.255
No, then he's gonna move in with
Mike and be your foster brother.

08:21.290 --> 08:24.192
Look, I don't need him giving
me the third degree about Callie.

08:24.226 --> 08:25.459
I feel bad enough as it is.

08:25.495 --> 08:28.062
You are over her, right?

08:28.098 --> 08:29.096
Yes.

08:29.132 --> 08:31.098
- You're sure?
- Yes.

08:31.117 --> 08:34.001
Look, I already had my
chance to get back with her.

08:34.037 --> 08:35.169
I said no.

08:35.221 --> 08:36.904
Wait, when was this?

08:38.875 --> 08:40.908
Uh, when Robert said

08:40.943 --> 08:42.777
he wasn't gonna sign the papers,

08:42.812 --> 08:44.879
Callie was freaking out and...

08:44.880 --> 08:48.783
Well, you two better get
your stories straight.

08:48.818 --> 08:51.418
If the social worker finds out about this,

08:51.471 --> 08:53.421
we'll really lose her for good.

08:56.149 --> 08:58.081
Well, it doesn't look
like she took anything.

08:58.344 --> 09:00.528
I'm so sorry. I had no idea...

09:00.580 --> 09:02.479
How could you have known?

09:02.514 --> 09:05.249
I would have told you, but I
didn't know she was talking to me.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.533
So she takes things?

09:06.568 --> 09:08.152
Yeah.

09:08.203 --> 09:10.171
She doesn't consider it stealing.

09:10.222 --> 09:12.273
She feels she's entitled because
I was such a horrible mother.

09:12.495 --> 09:14.528
She did look through your mail.

09:17.466 --> 09:20.200
Oh.

09:20.235 --> 09:21.402
What?

09:21.453 --> 09:23.336
Yep, a check's missing.

09:23.338 --> 09:25.272
I never saw her touch your checkbook.

09:25.307 --> 09:27.240
Well, she's pretty tricky at that.

09:27.243 --> 09:29.809
I mean, don't worry about it.

09:29.845 --> 09:31.778
It's not the first time I've had to cancel

09:31.813 --> 09:33.880
a check that Chloe stole.

09:33.915 --> 09:35.749
You said she's... she's on meds?

09:35.750 --> 09:37.884
Yeah, she's bipolar, axis I.

09:37.919 --> 09:39.820
She's already difficult,

09:39.855 --> 09:41.822
but when she's off her medication,

09:41.856 --> 09:43.923
she's even more paranoid and irrational.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.759
Must be hard.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.727
It is,

09:47.763 --> 09:49.663
for both of us.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.434
Hey, so now that Callie's at Rita's,

09:54.486 --> 09:57.370
where's A.J. gonna go
until Dad gets his license?

09:59.207 --> 10:01.140
Uh, well,

10:01.192 --> 10:03.342
Mama and I are just...

10:03.379 --> 10:05.979
we're gonna get our license renewed.

10:06.014 --> 10:08.264
Why? You're not gonna foster
any more kids, are you?

10:08.317 --> 10:10.884
No, no, no, no. It's just in case

10:10.919 --> 10:13.102
Callie's adoption gets delayed,

10:13.154 --> 10:15.188
to make sure that we
can keep fostering her.

10:15.224 --> 10:17.124
Didn't you renew your license

10:17.158 --> 10:18.991
last time Callie was
taken out of the house?

10:19.028 --> 10:20.911
Uh, no, no, no.

10:20.946 --> 10:22.895
That was... that was just an extension.

10:22.932 --> 10:25.698
So A.J.'s not leaving then?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.533
I'm just asking.

10:27.570 --> 10:29.802
B, I know that you have
your issues with A.J.,

10:29.838 --> 10:32.706
but you have had it just a
little bit easier than he has,

10:32.740 --> 10:34.508
so please don't be this way.

10:37.278 --> 10:40.096
So there weren't, like, any
cameras at this intersection?

10:40.149 --> 10:41.347
Isn't that kind of weird?

10:41.399 --> 10:44.000
Yeah, these days. But what's really weird

10:44.052 --> 10:45.985
is that there were cameras around there

10:46.020 --> 10:48.020
that should have caught the
driver trying to get away.

10:48.057 --> 10:50.890
Well, maybe he didn't try to get away.

10:50.926 --> 10:52.024
What do you mean?

10:52.061 --> 10:54.061
Well, maybe he hid somewhere

10:54.096 --> 10:56.897
or waited till dark or for
someone to come pick him up.

10:56.932 --> 10:59.765
That's actually a really good theory.

11:01.921 --> 11:03.803
Are you sure you don't want to be a cop?

11:03.839 --> 11:06.523
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, love.

11:20.422 --> 11:22.389
I was feeling pretty good
about myself, you know.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.241
I had the tool belt on and I
knew exactly what I was doing.

11:25.293 --> 11:28.095
I'm was even videoing the whole
thing with my cell phone, right?

11:28.147 --> 11:29.395
Yeah, that I'd like to see.

11:29.431 --> 11:31.331
The next thing I know, the pipe bursts

11:31.366 --> 11:33.066
and water's just...

11:33.101 --> 11:35.168
- Oh, no. What did you do?
- Cried like a baby.

11:35.203 --> 11:38.721
Just sitting there on the
floor, in a puddle, sobbing.

11:38.756 --> 11:41.975
Never fear. Shaz is here.

11:42.010 --> 11:45.011
And I promise I will treat your
pipes with gentle, loving care.

11:45.047 --> 11:46.679
Why, thank you.

11:46.784 --> 11:49.820
I hope you're not getting in Shaz's way.

11:49.855 --> 11:51.488
Oh, no, not at all.

11:51.490 --> 11:52.838
No, I don't mind the company.

11:52.890 --> 11:55.576
Stef, you need to get
dressed and get to work.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.360
Oh my gosh, I'd better get out of here.

11:57.428 --> 11:59.245
I'm so glad you're here.

12:00.532 --> 12:02.432
She seems great, huh?

12:07.572 --> 12:09.489
So what's it like living with Rita?

12:09.524 --> 12:11.274
I bet her place is messy.

12:11.309 --> 12:13.125
I hope you've got your own room

12:13.177 --> 12:15.111
- and a lock on the door.
- Eww.

12:15.147 --> 12:17.280
No, Rita went on a date with a guy.

12:17.316 --> 12:19.283
You're the only lesbian here, Private Cruz.

12:19.301 --> 12:21.150
Private?

12:21.153 --> 12:24.203
Yeah, I got my G.E.D. and I
join the army in two weeks.

12:24.255 --> 12:26.005
Congratulations, Carmen.

12:26.057 --> 12:28.741
That's been your goal for, like, so long.

12:28.777 --> 12:31.894
Yeah, Rita helped me get a waiver,

12:31.929 --> 12:33.730
since, you know, I have a record.

12:33.765 --> 12:35.798
All I gotta do now is pass the physical,

12:35.834 --> 12:37.634
and I start basic training.

12:37.635 --> 12:39.735
Good luck, girl. You
think this place is strict.

12:39.772 --> 12:42.673
Yeah, but in the army I get to
shoot an M32 grenade launcher.

12:42.707 --> 12:44.707
Ooh, maybe I should join the army,

12:44.743 --> 12:47.311
get one of those hot Navy Seals.

12:47.346 --> 12:49.513
Yeah, you'll last all of five
minutes in basic training.

12:49.565 --> 12:52.381
Shut your pie hole.

12:52.418 --> 12:56.302
So what if this social worker finds out

12:56.355 --> 12:58.989
you've been seeing Brandon the
whole time you were at G.U.?

12:58.990 --> 13:00.990
She won't.

13:00.993 --> 13:03.225
Brandon better not tell
her about the last time.

13:03.261 --> 13:06.028
- What last time?
- Thanks, Kiara. Thank you.

13:06.065 --> 13:08.764
Oh, sorry.

13:08.801 --> 13:10.000
Um,

13:10.034 --> 13:13.636
I kissed Brandon at the G.U. fundraiser,

13:13.688 --> 13:15.605
but only because Robert told me

13:15.624 --> 13:17.573
that he wasn't gonna let me get adopted,

13:17.609 --> 13:19.509
and I thought

13:19.528 --> 13:22.328
I was giving up Brandon for nothing.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.615
But he's told me that he's over it, so...

13:25.650 --> 13:27.283
Are you over him?

13:27.286 --> 13:29.286
Yeah, totally.

13:29.321 --> 13:31.104
Because she's got a new foster brother.

13:31.155 --> 13:33.090
- Woo-woo!
- And he is fine.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.091
Stop it. It's not like that.

13:35.126 --> 13:36.225
Yeah.

13:36.260 --> 13:37.927
Not like what?

13:40.115 --> 13:42.164
Huh-uh, no. You gotta go do touch-ups.

13:42.234 --> 13:44.234
Those dishes have been sitting
in the sink since the morning.

13:44.269 --> 13:46.753
They're not mine. And I'm not cleaning up

13:46.788 --> 13:48.804
after some stanky slobs.

13:48.807 --> 13:50.874
- They are too yours.
- And you're the stank.

13:50.908 --> 13:53.844
Hey, watch the way you
speak to one another.

13:53.879 --> 13:55.778
- She's mouthing off again.
- So?

13:55.813 --> 13:57.748
Give her an unacceptable and walk away.

13:57.799 --> 13:59.716
Brooke, Carmen is house foreman.

13:59.717 --> 14:01.618
- She is in charge.
- She ain't in charge of me.

14:01.653 --> 14:03.620
That attitude is the reason
why you have no privileges.

14:03.672 --> 14:05.621
- She's the one with the attitude.
- Really?

14:05.657 --> 14:07.356
She is a girl who came here

14:07.359 --> 14:09.592
and who worked this program
and made her dreams come true.

14:09.628 --> 14:13.230
Now you can get up and get into
the kitchen and do your chores,

14:13.248 --> 14:15.131
or you can get your
butt kicked out of here.

14:18.019 --> 14:20.070
Okay, ladies, this is
not a coffee klatch, okay?

14:20.121 --> 14:22.838
Please, homework. Thank you very much.

14:22.890 --> 14:24.807
Callie, we leave here in a few.

14:24.809 --> 14:26.176
Yeah.

14:26.211 --> 14:28.128
What crawled up her ass?

14:28.163 --> 14:29.846
She's acting hella crazy.

14:32.918 --> 14:34.884
So what are we doing here?

14:34.919 --> 14:36.802
Well, the driver...

14:36.889 --> 14:38.822
the driver of the hit-and-run...

14:38.856 --> 14:40.740
the only way he could have left the scene

14:40.793 --> 14:43.493
was down this alley, because
none of the security cameras

14:43.528 --> 14:45.445
caught him on tape.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.414
So Brandon had the idea that maybe

14:48.466 --> 14:51.268
he hid in this alley
until the coast was clear.

14:52.287 --> 14:54.604
Was it hard on Brandon...

14:54.639 --> 14:57.173
you bringing home all these kids?

14:57.209 --> 14:59.192
Uh, well, he was young

14:59.244 --> 15:01.076
when the twins came to live with us.

15:01.096 --> 15:03.346
And I think he enjoyed not
being the only child anymore.

15:03.381 --> 15:06.182
And he's been great with Callie and Jude

15:06.217 --> 15:08.284
for the most part.

15:12.124 --> 15:13.956
Maybe he hid in the dumpster...

15:13.991 --> 15:15.926
the driver.

15:15.961 --> 15:18.727
Or maybe went up the fire escape.

15:18.764 --> 15:21.548
Or maybe he got on a bus.

15:24.001 --> 15:25.902
So, as you know,

15:25.953 --> 15:28.471
I asked to speak to both you and Callie.

15:28.506 --> 15:30.423
This isn't an interrogation.

15:30.475 --> 15:32.442
I just wanted to hear
from your point of view

15:32.494 --> 15:34.628
what transpired between you two.

15:34.679 --> 15:37.681
Um, okay. Well, I... I think we...

15:37.682 --> 15:40.216
Sorry, just talk about yourself.

15:40.251 --> 15:42.184
Oh, okay.

15:42.221 --> 15:45.388
Um, well, I... I...

15:47.091 --> 15:49.192
my feelings just sort of developed

15:49.244 --> 15:50.911
gradually, I guess.

15:50.962 --> 15:52.895
And I thought that she and Jude

15:52.931 --> 15:54.780
were only gonna be with us temporarily.

15:54.817 --> 15:56.966
But you knew foster siblings aren't allowed

15:57.001 --> 15:59.735
to engage in any sort
of romantic relationship.

15:59.770 --> 16:00.937
Yes.

16:00.972 --> 16:02.072
And we...

16:02.106 --> 16:06.710
I tried my best not to act on anything.

16:06.745 --> 16:10.480
And we never...

16:10.515 --> 16:11.581
But you kissed.

16:11.616 --> 16:13.316
Yes, once.

16:13.335 --> 16:15.268
When was that?

16:15.303 --> 16:17.269
Um, at my moms' wedding.

16:17.322 --> 16:18.522
Why?

16:18.557 --> 16:20.222
Why did we kiss?

16:20.259 --> 16:22.292
Why then? Did something happen?

16:22.326 --> 16:23.493
No.

16:25.230 --> 16:27.947
They asked if they could adopt us.

16:27.982 --> 16:29.365
And what did you say?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.000
We said yes.

16:31.036 --> 16:33.836
And this was before or
after you kissed Brandon?

16:33.871 --> 16:35.038
After, definitely.

16:35.072 --> 16:37.673
Before. It was that morning.

16:37.676 --> 16:41.760
I... I was trying to blow it up, I guess.

16:41.797 --> 16:44.530
I didn't feel like I
deserved to be adopted.

16:44.566 --> 16:45.815
And who initiated the kiss?

16:45.850 --> 16:46.832
I did.

16:46.869 --> 16:48.802
It was me, definitely.

16:48.836 --> 16:51.620
To mess things up before
they got messed up?

16:51.657 --> 16:53.355
Yeah.

16:53.392 --> 16:56.243
So your feelings for
Brandon weren't genuine?

16:57.528 --> 16:58.510
No, they were.

16:58.547 --> 17:00.363
Would you say you were in love?

17:00.432 --> 17:03.048
I guess. Yes.

17:03.085 --> 17:05.018
And now?

17:08.140 --> 17:09.855
I love her.

17:09.906 --> 17:11.740
I love him.

17:11.777 --> 17:13.977
- As a sister.
- As a brother.

17:14.011 --> 17:15.810
And your foster moms had no idea?

17:15.846 --> 17:17.747
No. That's why they sent me

17:17.781 --> 17:19.583
to Girls United when they found out.

17:19.617 --> 17:21.585
They never would have let
us live under the same roof

17:21.618 --> 17:23.720
if they'd thought anything
was going on between us.

17:23.755 --> 17:26.789
Okay, I just have one more
question for you, Brandon.

17:26.825 --> 17:30.326
Did you ever violate the restraining order?

17:30.362 --> 17:31.661
What?

17:31.696 --> 17:35.230
Did you ever see Callie secretly,
while she was at Girls United?

17:35.267 --> 17:36.499
Uh, no.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.268
Okay then.

17:38.302 --> 17:41.153
Thank you for talking to me.

17:41.205 --> 17:43.205
Can I ask you a question?

17:43.258 --> 17:44.340
Sure.

17:44.393 --> 17:46.977
Um, my moms were just worried

17:46.979 --> 17:49.011
their foster license may expire

17:49.047 --> 17:50.880
before Callie's adoption comes through.

17:50.915 --> 17:53.115
So they were wondering if they
needed to renewed it, just in case.

17:53.117 --> 17:55.818
On, no, they're fine.

17:55.854 --> 17:58.654
Their license is good
for another two years.

17:58.690 --> 18:01.458
Okay, great.

18:01.509 --> 18:03.460
I will let them know.

18:06.982 --> 18:08.359
I remember a young man,

18:08.406 --> 18:11.040
African-American, got on the bus,

18:11.076 --> 18:13.192
blood all over his shirt and face.

18:13.228 --> 18:15.077
He was real jumpy.

18:15.114 --> 18:16.963
- There was blood?
- Oh, yeah.

18:16.999 --> 18:20.049
'Cause I had to clean it off his
seat before I started my next run.

18:20.085 --> 18:23.119
Okay, do you happen to remember
which stop it was that he got off?

18:23.122 --> 18:25.055
I think so.

18:25.106 --> 18:27.723
Pretty sure I let him off on Frontera,

18:27.759 --> 18:29.710
right in front of that big pharmacy.

18:31.829 --> 18:35.832
So right now there are
three user interfaces.

18:35.867 --> 18:38.684
So one is like a search engine

18:38.721 --> 18:42.405
for foster kids to find out
where to get the stuff they need.

18:42.407 --> 18:45.424
And the second is where kids can find

18:45.477 --> 18:49.211
family and friends that, you
know, they've lost contact with.

18:49.248 --> 18:50.380
And tell them what you're calling it.

18:50.415 --> 18:53.016
It's called "Fost and Found."

18:53.051 --> 18:55.218
- "Fost and Found?"
- I think it's clever.

18:55.253 --> 18:56.987
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

18:57.021 --> 18:59.905
And then there's gonna
be a storycorps interface

18:59.942 --> 19:02.925
where basically kids can upload audio

19:02.961 --> 19:06.113
and videos of themselves telling
their stories about the system.

19:06.147 --> 19:08.065
- What kind of stories?
- Anything.

19:08.099 --> 19:09.932
But, I mean, the idea is

19:09.968 --> 19:11.934
to call out social workers
that aren't doing their jobs,

19:11.970 --> 19:13.769
unfit foster families,

19:13.806 --> 19:16.289
judges that keep ruling against adoptions.

19:16.357 --> 19:17.673
What about sketchy group homes

19:17.710 --> 19:20.309
where they force you to do slave labor?

19:20.346 --> 19:21.979
By all means, Brooke, alert the media

19:22.013 --> 19:23.498
to the horrors here at Girls United.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.965
Okay, well, maybe not this one,

19:26.018 --> 19:28.885
but there are some really
nasty group homes out there.

19:28.921 --> 19:31.721
- What are you doing it for?
- It's for school credit,

19:31.757 --> 19:33.824
but also it's so that foster kids

19:33.858 --> 19:35.659
can have a voice and be heard.

19:35.661 --> 19:37.027
Well, it's not like we can use it.

19:37.063 --> 19:38.929
They don't let us use the Internet.

19:38.964 --> 19:41.664
Yes, but you're not gonna
be here forever. Right, Dee?

19:41.701 --> 19:44.684
So I was hoping

19:44.720 --> 19:47.671
maybe I could record some of your stories

19:47.707 --> 19:50.307
and upload them for you.

19:52.478 --> 19:55.445
Daphne, you could talk
about how hard it's been

19:55.480 --> 19:57.364
for you to get visitations with Tasha.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.184
Yeah, but I don't want to mess
up my chances of getting her back.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.486
My probation hearing's coming up.

20:02.520 --> 20:06.022
We can't risk making
things harder for ourselves.

20:06.057 --> 20:07.941
And you're so close to getting adopted,

20:07.977 --> 20:10.160
you can't go around kicking
the hornet's nest either.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.096
What do you think?

20:13.132 --> 20:16.666
Well, most of the people I
know working in the system

20:16.719 --> 20:18.035
do care, you know.

20:18.069 --> 20:20.953
- And they try their best to do their jobs.
- Yeah.

20:21.039 --> 20:22.890
And there are abuses.

20:22.924 --> 20:24.991
Someone needs to call them out on it.

20:25.027 --> 20:28.662
But it's a lot to ask of kids
who could suffer the consequences.

20:28.696 --> 20:30.663
Maybe you need to find some kids

20:30.699 --> 20:32.766
that have less to lose.

20:37.373 --> 20:40.140
It's so great to work for
clients I like for a change.

20:40.142 --> 20:41.375
That's nice of you to say that.

20:41.410 --> 20:43.109
Well, it's true.

20:43.144 --> 20:45.095
I mean, you've got a beautiful home,

20:45.131 --> 20:47.364
a beautiful family.
And your partner Stef...

20:47.400 --> 20:49.165
what a great gal, huh?

20:49.218 --> 20:52.152
Yeah, yeah, I really lucked
out in the wife department.

20:52.188 --> 20:54.020
Yeah, you really did. I mean,

20:54.089 --> 20:56.123
they don't make broads
like that anymore, you know?

20:56.125 --> 20:58.057
Like, really strong but feminine...

20:58.094 --> 21:00.711
I bet she looks hot in her uniform.

21:01.963 --> 21:04.615
Oh, hey there.

21:04.650 --> 21:06.500
Hey. How's it going?

21:06.535 --> 21:08.469
- Good, good.
- Okay.

21:08.503 --> 21:10.436
There you go. We'll see you tomorrow.

21:10.472 --> 21:12.506
Yeah, okay. All right.

21:13.491 --> 21:15.509
- Have a good one.
- Yeah.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.531
- Where did you find her?
- What?

21:21.584 --> 21:22.598
Hey, B.

21:22.634 --> 21:25.219
Hey, honey. How did...

21:25.270 --> 21:28.122
how did the interview go
with the social worker?

21:28.156 --> 21:29.256
Fine.

21:29.290 --> 21:31.023
Just fine?

21:31.059 --> 21:32.392
What did she say? What did she ask?

21:32.427 --> 21:35.162
Um, she asked me

21:35.197 --> 21:36.896
if I was still in love with Callie.

21:36.932 --> 21:39.967
Okay, and what did you say?

21:40.001 --> 21:42.935
I told her that I'm not the foster
brother she has to worry about.

21:42.971 --> 21:45.588
What does that mean?

21:45.624 --> 21:46.807
You tell me.

21:46.842 --> 21:49.509
I know your that foster
license didn't expire.

21:49.545 --> 21:52.679
And since A.J. is only living
here now that Callie's not...

21:52.730 --> 21:56.250
that can only mean one thing, right?

21:56.301 --> 21:57.634
So is that it?

21:57.670 --> 22:01.387
Is Callie hooking up with A.J. now?

22:03.308 --> 22:07.126
Uh, the night of her birthday party

22:07.163 --> 22:09.363
I saw A.J. and Callie kiss.

22:13.051 --> 22:15.301
So are you gonna get a
restraining order against him?

22:15.336 --> 22:17.019
It's a very different situation, Brandon.

22:17.056 --> 22:18.154
A.J. is not gonna be Callie's brother.

22:18.207 --> 22:20.173
If it's so different, then why did you lie?

22:20.209 --> 22:22.843
Why didn't you just tell us that
A.J. has to live somewhere else?

22:22.862 --> 22:24.076
Because we didn't want to embarrass them.

22:24.113 --> 22:25.979
But you didn't mind humiliating me?

22:26.015 --> 22:28.714
- It's not the same thing.
- Stop saying that, Mom.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.616
It is the same.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.519
The only difference is, good old Brandon

22:32.555 --> 22:34.471
has to take it on the chin

22:34.522 --> 22:37.290
every time you bring in a
stray kid into this house

22:37.326 --> 22:39.425
without even asking me how I feel about it.

22:42.597 --> 22:44.498
Luckily, I'm out of here in a year anyway.

22:44.549 --> 22:46.383
And you can adopt all the kids you want,

22:46.417 --> 22:48.352
turn this place into a
group home for all I care,

22:48.403 --> 22:51.421
because it's obvious you guys do
not want to live alone together.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.207
Excuse me?

22:53.209 --> 22:56.192
What, you don't think we can't
hear you bickering all the time?

22:56.228 --> 22:58.912
We know you're in therapy.
Maybe you guys should just worry

22:58.948 --> 23:01.181
about your own relationship for once.

23:12.845 --> 23:14.827
You canceled the check?

23:14.863 --> 23:16.930
The one you stole from me? You bet I did.

23:16.932 --> 23:19.865
I'm your daughter, Mom. Don't you
even care if I starve to death?

23:19.919 --> 23:22.553
Yes, Chloe, I do care. I care very much.

23:22.587 --> 23:24.820
But I'm not going to
continue to enable you.

23:24.873 --> 23:27.807
Enable? Is that your excuse
for being a bad mother?

23:27.843 --> 23:30.477
I know that that's the way you feel, Chloe.

23:30.479 --> 23:32.445
- You've said it to me a million times.
- No, Mom.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.214
It's not the way that
I feel. It's the truth.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.134
I'm not gonna talk to you
when you're acting like this.

23:37.185 --> 23:39.102
- I hate you.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

23:39.153 --> 23:41.153
And Daddy hated you too,

23:41.190 --> 23:43.257
because you made him miserable.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.909
And that's why he killed himself.

23:51.933 --> 23:56.118
Don't you ever lay your hands on me again.

24:04.414 --> 24:06.214
I'm sorry you had to see that.

24:06.415 --> 24:08.382
You know, I've been punched.

24:08.417 --> 24:11.152
I've been kicked. I've been
spit on by girls before,

24:11.186 --> 24:13.153
and I always manage to keep it together.

24:13.205 --> 24:16.022
- But, you know, my own daughter...
- You don't have to explain.

24:16.058 --> 24:18.224
Yeah, I do, okay?

24:18.260 --> 24:20.861
I mean, she took the divorce very hard.

24:20.896 --> 24:23.631
And maybe it was my fault.
You know, I've always...

24:23.682 --> 24:25.066
always been married to my work.

24:25.101 --> 24:28.702
But I didn't realize

24:28.704 --> 24:30.704
how depressed he had gotten.

24:34.576 --> 24:36.460
Chloe is the one who found him.

24:38.381 --> 24:41.414
Yeah, I tried to pull her closer,

24:41.451 --> 24:44.351
but she blamed me.

24:44.386 --> 24:46.569
And I felt guilty.

24:46.622 --> 24:49.289
So every time she asked for money,

24:49.325 --> 24:51.092
I just wrote her a check.

24:51.109 --> 24:55.028
Basically I broke every rule
that we try to teach you at G.U.

24:55.064 --> 24:57.230
And now...

24:57.266 --> 24:59.200
now that I'm finally drawing boundaries,

24:59.234 --> 25:02.036
she thinks I'm cruel and heartless.

25:02.087 --> 25:05.205
She is right about one thing...

25:05.240 --> 25:08.174
I am a terrible mother for
letting it get to this point.

25:08.211 --> 25:10.845
No, you are not a terrible mother, okay?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.681
She said some really
horrible things to you.

25:13.715 --> 25:15.750
And it's not like when
the G.U. girls lash out.

25:15.801 --> 25:17.984
She's your daughter. Of course it hurts.

25:18.019 --> 25:21.756
I think I need to take some
time off from Girls United.

25:21.790 --> 25:23.490
Can you?

25:23.526 --> 25:25.425
No.

25:29.598 --> 25:31.347
Hey, man, what's up?

25:31.400 --> 25:33.400
I have a big math test tomorrow.

25:33.435 --> 25:35.502
Oh, yeah?

25:35.538 --> 25:39.140
Well, I'm actually pretty good at
math, so if you want some help...

25:39.192 --> 25:41.474
Can you just shut up
so I can study, please?

25:43.261 --> 25:45.311
Sure.

25:45.347 --> 25:47.280
Okay.

25:49.018 --> 25:51.117
I just got a text from Brandon.

25:51.153 --> 25:53.104
He's gonna stay in Idyllwild tonight.

25:53.138 --> 25:55.055
Good.

25:55.090 --> 25:56.856
Give him time to cool down.

25:58.211 --> 26:00.009
What's that?

26:00.046 --> 26:01.979
The video surveillance from the pharmacy.

26:02.030 --> 26:04.765
- That was fast.
- Everything's on computer these days.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.800
All you need is an access code.

26:06.803 --> 26:08.935
It's amazing anyone gets
away with anything now,

26:08.938 --> 26:10.904
with all the cameras everywhere.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.540
My hunch is that the driver came in

26:13.576 --> 26:15.709
to get bandages or some
stuff for first aid.

26:15.744 --> 26:17.711
I'm hoping to get a visual I.D.

26:20.650 --> 26:23.616
Does it bother you that the
kids know we're having problems?

26:23.618 --> 26:25.586
We're not having problems.

26:25.605 --> 26:28.521
It's good for them to
see that couples fight.

26:28.557 --> 26:31.291
They're fine. We're fine.

26:55.968 --> 26:57.951
Hey.

26:57.987 --> 26:59.903
You want to go to the beach later?

26:59.955 --> 27:03.440
I don't... I don't think I can.

27:04.727 --> 27:06.826
Oh, okay. Well, we don't
have to go to the beach.

27:06.863 --> 27:10.346
- We can do something else.
- (School bell rings)

27:10.398 --> 27:12.532
All right, everyone, take your seats.

27:14.202 --> 27:16.186
Turn over your papers and begin.

27:37.826 --> 27:40.109
Teacher: <i>Jude, excuse me?</i>

27:41.864 --> 27:44.964
30 minutes. I don't think
it's gonna be enough time.

27:45.017 --> 27:47.867
Uh, sorry.

27:50.972 --> 27:54.407
Jude, Jude, what are you doing?

27:54.442 --> 27:55.776
Why aren't you taking your math test?

27:55.810 --> 27:57.611
I don't feel like it.

27:57.646 --> 27:59.480
Well, I'm sorry you don't feel like it,

27:59.515 --> 28:01.332
but you have to take
the test, or you'll fail.

28:01.366 --> 28:02.583
I don't care if I fail.

28:02.617 --> 28:04.518
- Well, you should.
- Why?

28:04.553 --> 28:06.519
Why should I care about some
stupid math test when Callie's

28:06.571 --> 28:09.323
back in the system and you
and Mom are getting a divorce?

28:09.325 --> 28:10.557
Why should I care about anything?

28:10.593 --> 28:13.143
Jude. Jude.

28:19.352 --> 28:21.268
You know he's just acting out.

28:21.319 --> 28:23.037
He's a teenager.

28:23.071 --> 28:25.172
For the record, Stef and I
are not getting a divorce.

28:25.223 --> 28:27.708
We're just going through
a little rough patch.

28:27.742 --> 28:30.076
We started couples counseling.
Except now Stef doesn't want to go.

28:30.078 --> 28:33.012
With five kids... sorry, make that six...

28:33.048 --> 28:35.816
it's hard to make us a priority.

28:35.851 --> 28:39.552
Well, if you don't, you
risk waking up one day

28:39.605 --> 28:41.521
and realizing there's no "us" left.

28:41.523 --> 28:44.590
I know. I just don't know
how to get Stef to see that.

28:44.626 --> 28:47.394
Don't take divorce off the table.

28:48.497 --> 28:52.266
What I mean is, sometimes people think

28:52.300 --> 28:54.317
they can neglect the relationship because

28:54.369 --> 28:56.452
"we're married with kids,
we're never breaking up."

28:56.505 --> 28:59.506
But it's not okay to be unhappy.

28:59.541 --> 29:02.108
You're right.

29:02.144 --> 29:04.444
I'm not happy and I need to tell her.

29:05.463 --> 29:07.381
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:07.415 --> 29:09.115
Can I talk to Callie?

29:09.151 --> 29:11.050
Cal.

29:13.972 --> 29:15.756
Hey.

29:15.825 --> 29:16.990
What are you doing here?

29:19.060 --> 29:21.996
I messed up really bad.

29:22.030 --> 29:23.963
I walked out of my math test.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.666
I just got up and left.

29:26.701 --> 29:28.736
Then I yelled at Lena.

29:30.705 --> 29:32.373
I don't want to go home.

29:32.407 --> 29:34.325
Why not?

29:35.611 --> 29:38.345
Are you afraid or something,

29:38.346 --> 29:40.197
'cause you yelled?

29:40.249 --> 29:42.333
Jude, I've put them through way worse.

29:42.367 --> 29:44.300
What do you think they're gonna do to me?

29:44.353 --> 29:47.070
Every kid says mean things
to their parents, Jude.

29:47.123 --> 29:48.454
Not kids like us.

29:48.490 --> 29:51.157
You can't be afraid to speak up,

29:51.192 --> 29:52.393
or mess up even.

29:52.427 --> 29:54.994
I mean, I get it. We're all the same...

29:55.030 --> 29:56.329
every foster kid.

29:56.365 --> 29:58.265
We think we're not allowed

29:58.317 --> 30:00.817
to say what we need or
to stand up for ourselves.

30:00.869 --> 30:04.738
But we have to, okay?
And that includes you.

30:04.773 --> 30:05.989
Can I say something?

30:08.844 --> 30:10.961
Jude, you know,

30:11.012 --> 30:13.846
parents don't love you more

30:13.883 --> 30:16.750
because you're biologically theirs.

30:16.786 --> 30:19.653
I mean, your moms... they don't love you

30:19.688 --> 30:21.622
because you're easy to deal with

30:21.656 --> 30:24.258
or because you keep your mouth shut.

30:24.292 --> 30:27.227
They love you because you're you.

30:30.465 --> 30:32.031
Yeah.

30:42.377 --> 30:44.912
Our moms are splitting up.

30:44.947 --> 30:46.997
Why would you say that?

30:47.048 --> 30:48.915
I overheard them and Brandon fighting.

30:48.951 --> 30:51.868
He said they were having problems
and going to couples therapy.

30:51.903 --> 30:53.921
That doesn't mean they're
gonna split up though.

30:53.955 --> 30:55.788
I mean, is that what
they were fighting about?

30:55.825 --> 30:58.692
No, they were fighting about you and A.J.

31:02.565 --> 31:04.530
Um...

31:05.817 --> 31:08.501
So what did they say to Brandon?

31:08.537 --> 31:10.436
That they caught you kissing.

31:14.542 --> 31:16.609
Why do you keep doing this?

31:25.920 --> 31:29.438
Hey, I am so sorry I yelled at you.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.623
Do you think I can retake my math test?

31:31.659 --> 31:34.425
Apology accepted,

31:34.461 --> 31:36.362
but that will be up to your teacher, love.

31:36.396 --> 31:38.396
We're just glad you're okay, sweetheart.

31:38.432 --> 31:40.298
- We love you.
- I love you too.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.403
- Hey, what... ?
- You didn't answer any of my texts.

31:44.454 --> 31:46.538
- Sorry.
- (Cell phone rings)

31:46.539 --> 31:48.507
Excuse me. I have to take this.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.509
Are you sure you're okay? Really?

31:50.544 --> 31:53.278
- 'Cause we were worried, you know?
- Yeah.

31:53.314 --> 31:56.015
- What's going on?
- Jude had a rough day.

31:57.268 --> 31:59.201
Oh.

31:59.252 --> 32:01.953
Sorry to hear about that, buddy.

32:04.275 --> 32:07.159
Callie, there's a situation at Girls United

32:07.161 --> 32:10.045
I'm sorry, we have to go.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.114
Bye.

32:15.869 --> 32:18.537
Hey.

32:18.571 --> 32:20.471
Hey.

32:22.742 --> 32:24.876
That was very sweet...
what you said to Jude.

32:27.647 --> 32:30.749
You know, I know you haven't
exactly had the best day yourself.

32:35.355 --> 32:37.489
And seeing you be so kind and thoughtful

32:37.525 --> 32:39.490
it made me realize

32:39.559 --> 32:41.426
that I think I have more compassion

32:41.461 --> 32:43.394
for my adopted kids than I do for you.

32:46.099 --> 32:48.182
I just... I think

32:48.219 --> 32:50.134
in my mind you haven't suffered

32:50.186 --> 32:52.104
as much as they have.

32:52.155 --> 32:55.307
You've had a stable home

32:55.342 --> 32:57.942
and parents that have loved you

32:57.978 --> 32:59.912
and cared for you from
the day you were born.

32:59.947 --> 33:02.131
And that's... that's not fair.

33:02.165 --> 33:04.115
It's not fair. I know you've suffered.

33:04.151 --> 33:06.085
I know you hurt.

33:06.119 --> 33:08.787
And I know that things aren't just great

33:08.823 --> 33:10.955
just because you have us.

33:13.827 --> 33:17.528
We weren't there for you about Callie.

33:17.565 --> 33:19.597
I see now that your heart was broken.

33:19.650 --> 33:21.532
And I should have been there.

33:21.568 --> 33:23.501
I should have been more understanding.

33:23.537 --> 33:26.688
I just always expect
you to do the right thing

33:26.740 --> 33:29.240
because you just... you always do, B.

33:29.276 --> 33:31.175
And I'm sorry.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.395
You've always been so warm and welcoming

33:34.448 --> 33:36.498
to all the kids that we've
brought in this house,

33:36.534 --> 33:40.018
it just never occurred to me that
you might not actually be okay.

33:49.997 --> 33:52.865
If you don't want your
father to foster A.J.,

33:52.900 --> 33:54.866
I think you need to say something.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.934
You have that right.

33:58.939 --> 34:00.873
And I'll support you.

Carmen and Brooke have been at
each other's throats all day.

34:46.219 --> 34:48.753
I sent them up to their rooms.

34:48.789 --> 34:50.655
- (Girls arguing)
- Are you kidding me?

34:50.708 --> 34:52.824
Damn it. Keep the girls down here.

34:56.797 --> 34:59.030
Rita: Okay, that's enough.
Brooke, downstairs now.

34:59.065 --> 35:01.032
Carmen, stop! I said enough!

35:01.034 --> 35:02.867
I mean that. Carmen.

35:02.902 --> 35:04.820
- Carmen: Get out of my face, bitch!
- (Slap lands)

35:04.855 --> 35:06.804
(Carmen exclaims)

35:09.710 --> 35:10.742
Oh my god.

35:10.777 --> 35:14.413
Michelle, take Carmen and get some ice.

35:14.447 --> 35:16.481
Brooke, get to your room right now.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.320
- We're gonna have to call the police.
- Can we call Stef?

35:22.373 --> 35:23.572
Yeah.

35:26.594 --> 35:28.510
So what happened?

35:30.496 --> 35:32.414
Brooke and me were in a fight.

35:32.449 --> 35:34.266
And Rita came upstairs.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.434
And?

35:38.038 --> 35:41.106
And she tried to break it up

35:41.141 --> 35:42.940
and then she hit me.

35:42.976 --> 35:44.275
Brooke?

35:44.311 --> 35:46.010
No. Rita.

35:46.045 --> 35:48.713
- I never laid a hand on her.
- It's true.

35:48.766 --> 35:51.650
Rita punched her in the face.

35:58.864 --> 36:00.074
I know what you must be thinking.

36:00.081 --> 36:01.097
I'm not.

36:01.132 --> 36:04.050
- I did not hit Carmen.
- I know that.

36:04.052 --> 36:06.686
Ma'am, we have to cuff you.

36:06.704 --> 36:08.704
Is that really necessary?

36:08.739 --> 36:10.755
Yes, Callie. It's the law.

36:24.505 --> 36:27.472
I'm gonna take Brooke down to
the station, get her statement.

36:27.509 --> 36:29.509
And I'll bring Carmen as soon as I take her

36:29.561 --> 36:31.360
to the E.R. to get checked out.

36:31.411 --> 36:33.612
- Callie, go get your stuff.
- No, I'm staying here.

36:33.614 --> 36:35.581
What? No, no, you're not staying here.

36:35.617 --> 36:39.217
Well, obviously, I can't stay at
Rita's, and I'd rather stay here.

36:39.253 --> 36:41.269
Hey, given what just
happened, there is no way...

36:41.322 --> 36:42.454
Kiara and Daphne have my back.

36:42.507 --> 36:45.123
The last time I was put
in a random foster home,

36:45.175 --> 36:47.226
the woman locked me in a room.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.333
Fine. I will call your social worker.

36:54.385 --> 36:56.235
You keep your cell phone on you.

36:56.271 --> 36:59.005
You do not let anyone
know that you have it.

36:59.039 --> 37:00.873
And at the first sign of
trouble, you call me, yes?

37:00.925 --> 37:02.875
Yeah.

37:14.021 --> 37:15.987
Oh, I didn't even hear you come home.

37:16.023 --> 37:17.989
- Hey.
- How did it go?

37:17.992 --> 37:20.826
Well,

37:20.827 --> 37:22.762
the girls are sticking to their story

37:22.813 --> 37:24.530
that Rita hit Carmen.

37:24.565 --> 37:27.400
Rita was released for the night,

37:27.402 --> 37:29.385
but looks like she'll
be charged with assault.

37:29.420 --> 37:31.721
I don't believe it. They have to be lying.

37:31.755 --> 37:33.773
I don't know.

37:33.807 --> 37:36.342
Rita's under a lot of pressure.

37:36.376 --> 37:38.543
Can't be easy dealing with those girls.

37:38.545 --> 37:40.512
I just... I think sometimes people

37:40.547 --> 37:42.414
lose their tempers and snap.

37:42.449 --> 37:46.135
No, I don't think that Rita's
even capable of that. Do you?

37:46.170 --> 37:48.119
I... I think we're all capable

37:48.155 --> 37:50.356
of doing things that we
never thought we'd do.

37:53.193 --> 37:56.228
Think you're looking for a
needle in a haystack there?

37:56.264 --> 37:58.179
Maybe.

38:02.336 --> 38:04.103
But maybe not.

38:08.275 --> 38:09.909
That's Joe Olsen...

38:09.943 --> 38:12.795
the son of the owner of the
S.U.V. that hit the kids.

38:12.847 --> 38:14.012
Are you sure?

38:14.047 --> 38:16.815
Yeah, I interviewed him.

38:16.818 --> 38:20.018
Well, I thought they said
they reported the car stolen.

38:20.054 --> 38:22.588
Yeah, the day after the accident.

38:22.639 --> 38:23.889
I never bought that. Okay.

38:23.925 --> 38:26.692
They didn't find his
fingerprints in the car though.

38:26.693 --> 38:28.693
But didn't you say the
guy on the bus was black?

38:28.730 --> 38:30.829
Yeah, but this Joe Olsen

38:30.882 --> 38:33.766
shows up in this pharmacy 40
minutes after the accident?

38:33.818 --> 38:35.635
I'm sorry, but that's not coincidence.

38:40.708 --> 38:44.911
Callie: I wanted to take this
opportunity to tell you my story.

38:45.045 --> 38:45.813
Callie?

38:46.847 --> 38:48.344
So my little brother and I

38:48.534 --> 38:50.449
have been in seven different foster homes.

38:50.501 --> 38:52.981
And in one home I was raped

38:52.989 --> 38:57.000
by an older foster brother, Liam Olmstead.

38:57.557 --> 38:59.958
And then there was this other home

38:59.994 --> 39:03.596
and we had this foster dad... Jim Pearson.

39:03.632 --> 39:06.833
And one day he was beating
my little brother so bad,

39:06.902 --> 39:09.635
I had to take a baseball bat to his car

39:09.670 --> 39:11.637
to get him to stop.

39:11.762 --> 39:14.731
Nothing happened to him. I went to juvie.

39:16.867 --> 39:19.501
After that, I ended up

39:19.554 --> 39:22.871
in a safe, loving foster home.

39:22.907 --> 39:26.742
And my foster moms
adopted my little brother,

39:26.744 --> 39:29.478
but the judge wouldn't
allow them to adopt me.

39:29.514 --> 39:31.431
And the same judge,

39:31.465 --> 39:33.382
Judge Jeffrey Ringer,

39:33.434 --> 39:35.385
continues to block my adoption

39:35.436 --> 39:37.369
without considering what I want.

39:37.405 --> 39:39.405
And that is what is wrong with the system.

39:39.757 --> 39:43.643
We foster kids have no
control over our own lives,

39:43.677 --> 39:45.612
and it is time that we speak up

39:45.646 --> 39:48.364
and we starting calling people out by name.

39:48.489 --> 39:50.655
That is the only way
that things will change.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.557
And we cannot be afraid.

39:52.594 --> 39:54.677
And that is why I'm telling my story

39:54.728 --> 39:56.646
and I... I...

39:56.697 --> 39:59.398
I really hope that you'll tell yours.

40:02.536 --> 40:04.137
Jude: What is this?

40:04.172 --> 40:06.371
Callie asked me to upload to her web app.

40:06.608 --> 40:09.342
Should she be saying those things?

40:09.376 --> 40:11.344
I don't think you should post it.

40:11.378 --> 40:13.278
It's too late.

40:13.313 --> 40:15.563
