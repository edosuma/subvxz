WEBVTT

00:04.456 --> 00:07.332
( music playing )

00:32.956 --> 00:35.915
- Oh.
- Man: Hello.

00:35.998 --> 00:38.248
I am so sorry.
I have the wrong room.

00:38.332 --> 00:40.956
- Uh, no, it's fine. Come in.
- I completely apologize.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.414
No, please! Please, I insist.
Come in.

00:42.498 --> 00:45.123
- Really?
- Wow! Please come in.

00:45.207 --> 00:47.915
Wh-- Please!
You should come inside.
Come inside.

00:47.998 --> 00:49.915
Don't be shy.
What a surprise.

00:49.998 --> 00:51.706
It's nice to have company.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.123
This is the right room.
I promise you.

00:54.207 --> 00:55.664
- Oh.
- Come on in.

00:55.748 --> 00:57.790
- I'm Rosie. Hi.
- Come on in! Hey!

00:57.873 --> 01:00.290
- I'm Erol.
- OK. Nice to meet you. Um--

01:00.373 --> 01:03.373
Make yourself comfortable.
I haven't seen anyone
for days.

01:03.456 --> 01:05.456
This is a nice room,
this is much bigger--

01:05.539 --> 01:08.123
How much are you paying
per night? My room's
like half this size.

01:08.207 --> 01:11.623
- I live here, actually. Yeah.
- You live here? Oh, cool. OK.

01:11.706 --> 01:14.123
- Yeah, shut the door.
- Yeah, I'm just worried,

01:14.207 --> 01:16.248
I meant to find--
We're staying in 217.

01:16.332 --> 01:18.539
The hallway
is really... funny, and I--

01:18.623 --> 01:21.123
- Shut the door.
That's fine.
- But anyway, yeah.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.998
Yeah, it's tricky.
But you're here now,

01:23.082 --> 01:25.290
- and that's all that matters.
- Yeah.

01:25.373 --> 01:27.165
Well, gee,
what a nice surprise.

01:27.248 --> 01:29.165
Oh, are you an artist?
Look at that!

01:29.248 --> 01:31.248
I tell you what,
it's a little--

01:31.332 --> 01:32.664
Why don't you
make yourself comfortable?

01:32.748 --> 01:34.581
- Get out of that, um...
- Get out of this...?

01:34.664 --> 01:36.332
This-- This thing.

01:36.414 --> 01:38.498
It's a little warm in here.
Take that off.

01:38.581 --> 01:41.082
Oh. I guess
it is  kind of warm.

01:41.165 --> 01:43.581
- Um, OK.
- Yeah.

01:43.664 --> 01:46.956
That's nice.
That's very nice.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.706
Yeah. That's good.

01:48.790 --> 01:51.539
Yeah, just throw it--
just toss it anywhere.

01:51.623 --> 01:52.998
Great, great, great.

01:53.082 --> 01:55.290
So, yeah, um...

01:55.373 --> 01:56.998
j-just...

01:57.082 --> 01:58.623
make yourself comfortable.

01:58.706 --> 02:01.332
You've seen me,
I'm in my underwear.

02:01.414 --> 02:02.998
You should
take that skirt off.

02:03.082 --> 02:06.207
You know, get yourself
in your... underwear.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.082
Yeah.

02:08.165 --> 02:10.414
Oh that's--
that's nice. Wow.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.998
Nice legs.
You a dancer?

02:13.082 --> 02:15.498
Ballerina? Something?
With legs like that.

02:15.581 --> 02:17.706
- Very nice.
- I just don't know
if I should do this,

02:17.790 --> 02:22.623
'cause my husband is in
the room, like, four rows down,

02:22.706 --> 02:24.539
and I have a kid,
and she's got a fever--

02:24.623 --> 02:27.373
Don't talk about
a husband and kid.
Just be anonymous.

02:27.456 --> 02:29.332
I don't want to know
any backstory
or anything like that.

02:29.414 --> 02:32.040
Just keep it physical.
That was great, what you--

02:32.123 --> 02:34.956
I think she's a real person.
She's a real backstory.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.831
( sighs ) Be primal.

02:36.915 --> 02:38.498
- Don't talk.
- Is that what you want?

02:38.581 --> 02:41.207
Want a little primal woman
just roll in here?

02:41.290 --> 02:43.248
OK, great. I got it.

02:43.332 --> 02:44.790
Gimme a second!

02:48.248 --> 02:51.373
- Meow.
- What's this?

02:51.456 --> 02:53.915
( meowing, hissing )

02:53.998 --> 02:58.748
It seems that a weird feral...
kitty has wandered
into my room.

02:58.831 --> 03:01.082
A rabid kitty,
it seems like.

03:01.165 --> 03:03.831
- ( yowling )
- It's a pretty kitty.

03:03.915 --> 03:05.373
- Beautiful.
- ( meowing )

03:05.456 --> 03:07.082
That's nice.

03:07.165 --> 03:08.915
( hissing )

03:08.998 --> 03:11.998
( kissing )

03:12.082 --> 03:14.290
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, that's nice.

03:14.373 --> 03:17.082
- ( meowing )
- Yeah, wait a second.

03:17.165 --> 03:19.414
No, no, don't do that.
Don't do the meowing thing.

03:19.498 --> 03:23.040
That's, uh,
it's taking me
out of it a little bit.

03:23.123 --> 03:26.082
- I'm a cat.
- I like that
you're being primal,

03:26.165 --> 03:27.664
I like that
you're being a kitty,

03:27.748 --> 03:29.748
but don't talk--
you know that.

03:29.831 --> 03:31.290
But here's the thing.

03:31.373 --> 03:33.748
It's the meowing
is kinda taking me out of it.

03:33.831 --> 03:35.748
Do you want to do it?
Maybe it's your turn.

03:35.831 --> 03:39.082
- I'm not gonna do this.
- I'm done. It's your turn.

03:39.165 --> 03:40.706
( knocking on door )

03:40.790 --> 03:43.956
You know,
I just don't know what--

03:44.040 --> 03:46.248
Oh, my God, I'm in the--
Sorry, I'm in the wrong room.

03:46.332 --> 03:48.165
No, I think
you're in the right room.

03:48.248 --> 03:49.706
No, come in. Please.

03:51.082 --> 03:52.373
I shouldn't.

03:52.456 --> 03:54.373
I think you should.

03:54.456 --> 03:55.873
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:55.956 --> 03:57.456
I have this guitar right here,

03:57.539 --> 04:00.248
and I just need somebody
to play it for me.

04:00.332 --> 04:02.664
- This guitar?
- Yeah. Do you think--

04:02.748 --> 04:04.623
Do you play guitar?

04:04.706 --> 04:06.332
Actually, I play
a little guitar.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.332
- Oh, really?
- A pluck. Just a little.

04:09.414 --> 04:12.456
- Yeah.
- Wow, you're so innocent
and shy.

04:12.539 --> 04:13.998
Do you like guitar?

04:14.082 --> 04:16.207
Um, I do. Wow,
that's very sexy.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.664
What happens when
someone plays the guitar?

04:18.748 --> 04:20.456
Well? What happens?

04:20.539 --> 04:22.831
Oh, I mean,
all kinds of things can happen.

04:22.915 --> 04:26.082
- Well, let me just
take this off.
- Oh, wow.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.790
- Ow. My God.
- What's under there?

04:27.873 --> 04:29.748
( grunting )
Actually,

04:29.831 --> 04:31.623
this does not feel good.

04:31.706 --> 04:35.123
I'm a little rusty. I haven't
been playing much lately,

04:35.207 --> 04:36.748
but I'll give it my--

04:36.831 --> 04:40.831
- ( playing )
- Yeah, thanks, stranger.

- Hello!

05:10.915 --> 05:12.706
Um, I'm Erol, I'm your--

05:12.790 --> 05:15.373
if everything goes well,
I'm gonna be your father, and...

05:15.456 --> 05:18.414
And I'm Rosie,
I'm gon-- I'm your mom.

05:18.498 --> 05:21.373
Right now,
it's December 18th, 2018,

05:21.456 --> 05:24.290
and I know
you're out in heaven,

05:24.373 --> 05:26.207
hanging out
with the spirits,

05:26.290 --> 05:28.539
but we're really excited
for you to come down

05:28.623 --> 05:31.915
through all
of the celestial orbits

05:31.998 --> 05:34.207
and join me
and my ovaries,

05:34.290 --> 05:36.290
and your dad tonight

05:36.373 --> 05:40.748
is going to use the sperm
inside of his... penis to--

05:40.831 --> 05:42.539
- Testicles.
First in my testicles.
- Oh, is it?

05:42.623 --> 05:44.123
It will shoot out of my penis.

05:44.207 --> 05:46.040
Anyway, and then
it's gonna come into me,

05:46.123 --> 05:47.664
and you're
gonna be formed.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.165
And that's the important thing
you said,

05:50.248 --> 05:52.498
which is, um,
where the sperm resides,

05:52.581 --> 05:55.581
not in the celestial heavens,
but in my testicles,

05:55.664 --> 05:57.873
which are a sac of two testes.

05:57.956 --> 06:00.165
It's a little more magical
than just that,

06:00.248 --> 06:01.915
because you have a soul,

06:01.998 --> 06:04.248
and we know that souls
come from God,

06:04.332 --> 06:07.040
and that's--
God is inside of all of us.

06:09.248 --> 06:11.581
Which is part of the reason
I don't believe, really, in God,

06:11.664 --> 06:13.248
because if God's inside of us,

06:13.332 --> 06:14.831
I don't really
believe in myself,

06:14.915 --> 06:17.539
so it's hard to believe
in a God of the kingdom of--

06:17.623 --> 06:18.956
It's a joke. That's--

06:19.040 --> 06:21.248
- ( stammers )
- You don't believe in anything.

06:21.332 --> 06:22.623
Look at your mother.

06:22.706 --> 06:24.873
She's so fucking beautiful!

06:24.956 --> 06:27.498
What is she doing with me?
That's the big mystery here.

06:27.581 --> 06:28.956
- No.
- You know?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.332
You're a wildly charismatic
and strange...

06:31.414 --> 06:32.706
and mysterious human being.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.414
- ( kissing )
- Mmm. Anyway,

06:34.498 --> 06:36.664
we are going to make you now.

06:36.748 --> 06:40.664
- What's that?
- We can put it down
and just get to it.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.790
No, let's set the camera
on the bed there,

06:42.873 --> 06:45.831
and then we'll shoot
the act of the conception,
that's the plan.

06:45.915 --> 06:49.248
Right? To shoot the--
the actual--

06:49.332 --> 06:51.040
I don't think we need
to make a porn video.

06:51.123 --> 06:53.414
We're just making,
like, a loving--

06:53.498 --> 06:55.498
I thought this was
just like foreplay.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.123
No, it won't be
a porn movie,

06:57.207 --> 06:59.414
I'm not gonna show anything
like penetration--

06:59.498 --> 07:00.998
- We got this motel
for a conception.
- Hold on a second. Let's--

07:01.082 --> 07:02.498
I thought that was
the point of this.

07:02.581 --> 07:04.165
You said that
I could do this.

07:04.248 --> 07:06.623
You said that we could shoot,
like, make-- document--

07:06.706 --> 07:08.332
You know when I say
I have a boundary,

07:08.414 --> 07:09.998
and then you cross the boundary,

07:10.082 --> 07:11.498
and then I say, "You just
crossed my boundary"?

07:11.581 --> 07:13.456
You're crossing
my boundary.

07:13.539 --> 07:14.748
( sighs )

07:14.831 --> 07:18.456
- ( Rosie moaning )
- ( Erol murmuring )

07:18.539 --> 07:20.498
- Rosie: Oh, baby.
- Erol: You feel good.

07:20.581 --> 07:24.290
OK, so when you cum,
you just have to
stay inside me for a little bit

07:24.373 --> 07:27.414
- so that the semen
doesn't all fall out of me.
- Yeah, I got it.

07:27.498 --> 07:29.998
( Rosie moaning )

07:30.082 --> 07:31.831
And I'm gonna put my legs
up against the wall

07:31.915 --> 07:33.915
for like an hour and a half,
just so you know.

07:33.998 --> 07:36.165
Yeah, I got you.
Baby, you feel so good.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.290
And just really thrust
when you cum,

07:38.373 --> 07:39.873
so it goes into my cervix.

07:39.956 --> 07:42.373
I got it. I got it.
I understand.

07:42.456 --> 07:44.748
( moaning )

07:44.831 --> 07:46.456
- Are you ready?
- I'm gonna cum.

07:46.539 --> 07:47.748
Oh, yeah!
Oh, I love you so--

07:47.831 --> 07:49.748
Oh, my God! You are  filming!

07:49.831 --> 07:51.831
- No, I'm not.
- You're filming!

07:51.915 --> 07:55.248
- Oh, my God, put that down.
- I'm so close.

07:55.332 --> 07:57.831
- Get off me. Get off me.
- I'm just shooting
a part of it.

07:57.915 --> 07:59.748
You knew we were gonna--
we were shooting a video--

07:59.831 --> 08:02.706
You never respect
anybody's boundaries.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.915
Do you wanna do this or not?
I'm so close.

08:04.998 --> 08:07.456
- Oh, my God.
- It's not about boundaries.

08:07.539 --> 08:10.373
- Let go of me!
- The idea was to shoot
the special night.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.456
- Baby, please?
- Get off.

08:13.873 --> 08:15.414
Listen, baby,
I'm sorry, OK?

08:15.498 --> 08:17.248
Put that away.
Will you just put it away?

08:17.332 --> 08:18.915
- Why?
- You're so beautiful.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.248
It's a nice document
to have, like when--

08:21.332 --> 08:24.207
- Mm-hmm.
- I won't shoot anything
if you don't want me to.

08:24.290 --> 08:27.332
I thought the idea
was we're gonna shoot
the special night...

08:27.414 --> 08:30.623
and preserve it, to, like,
our actual conception

08:30.706 --> 08:32.332
of a baby that
we're doing together.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.040
I want to do
what Richard Linklater did,

08:34.123 --> 08:36.248
and take it even further,
you know what I mean,

08:36.332 --> 08:37.623
with "Boyhood."

08:37.706 --> 08:40.539
Well, Richard Linklater
is an actual artist.

08:40.623 --> 08:42.373
Thanks. I mean, I mean--

08:42.456 --> 08:44.664
( stammering )

08:44.748 --> 08:46.082
You know what?
Nothing makes me feel better

08:46.165 --> 08:47.748
than trying to ruin
your self-esteem.

08:47.831 --> 08:50.082
- ( laughs )
- I don't need you for that.

08:50.165 --> 08:53.956
OK. Baby, I--

08:54.040 --> 08:57.706
I sometimes acquiesce
to your father's
strange desires,

08:57.790 --> 09:00.623
and, um, it's not always
a smart move on my part,

09:00.706 --> 09:04.290
but, uh... it appears
to be what's happening.

09:04.373 --> 09:06.998
So get the fuck over here
and let's make a baby.

09:07.082 --> 09:08.498
( laughing )

09:09.539 --> 09:11.623
You know, um--

09:11.706 --> 09:13.873
Aw, you smell like coffee.
It's nice.

09:13.956 --> 09:16.456
Oh, really? Yeah?
Is it nice? That's good.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.915
I love you. I'm really
excited about this.

09:18.998 --> 09:21.123
- Me too.
- Really excited.

09:21.207 --> 09:23.623
OK. Well,
if everything goes well,

09:23.706 --> 09:26.040
we'll see ya in nine months,
I guess, all right?

09:32.456 --> 09:34.123
Mmm.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.165
( moaning )

09:38.123 --> 09:40.165
- Oh!
- I love you.

09:41.165 --> 09:42.790
- Oh!
- I'm gonna cum.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.332
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna cum.

09:44.414 --> 09:47.207
I'm gonna cum.
I'm gonna cum.

09:47.290 --> 09:50.082
I'm coming!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

09:50.165 --> 09:51.831
Oh, God!

09:51.915 --> 09:54.248
( both panting )

10:01.373 --> 10:02.998
Oh, God.

10:03.082 --> 10:04.915
Oh, my God.

10:04.998 --> 10:06.956
Oh.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.581
Oh, God, that felt so good.

10:17.873 --> 10:19.248
Love you.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.040
Do you?

10:28.706 --> 10:30.748
I'm sorry.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.581
I did, I'm--

10:35.332 --> 10:36.581
I--

10:38.623 --> 10:40.165
( sighs )

10:41.623 --> 10:44.290
That was an accident.

10:44.373 --> 10:46.082
OK?

10:49.706 --> 10:54.082
You said you weren't
going to do that.

10:54.165 --> 10:57.082
I swear to God,
it was an accident.
It slipped out.

10:59.748 --> 11:01.790
( breathing deeply )

11:06.623 --> 11:08.915
You wanna watch "Frasier"?

11:08.998 --> 11:11.207
Where's the remote control?

11:13.123 --> 11:16.664
I just had one here before.

11:16.748 --> 11:19.123
Baby, it was an accident.
I'm sorry. Seriously.

11:19.207 --> 11:21.873
- We'll try again later.
- You pulled out.

11:21.956 --> 11:24.456
( sighs, grunts )

11:28.248 --> 11:29.790
( footsteps )

11:29.873 --> 11:31.998
Rosie.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.915
( laughs )
Don't look at me like that.

11:33.998 --> 11:34.998
What are you doing?

11:35.082 --> 11:36.581
I'm just checking out to see

11:36.664 --> 11:38.790
if we're gonna make
a documentary,

11:38.873 --> 11:41.456
it should be about the  whole
kit-and-kaboodle,
the whole evening.

11:41.539 --> 11:43.998
You can turn that off now,
because we're doing
the conception thing

11:44.082 --> 11:45.414
and we'll try it again later.

11:45.498 --> 11:46.873
Is that what
we're gonna do?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.165
We're gonna do
the conception thing?

11:49.248 --> 11:51.165
- Later.
- Oh, OK.

11:51.248 --> 11:52.956
I'm gonna take a shower,
actually.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.414
- Erol, do you want kids?
- Huh? ( sighs )

12:03.373 --> 12:04.581
( Erol sighs )

12:04.664 --> 12:06.456
Have you seen the Pert Plus?

12:06.539 --> 12:08.456
It's not in the shower.

12:08.539 --> 12:11.373
Hey, Rosie. Turn that off.

12:12.831 --> 12:14.664
Watch TV.

12:16.873 --> 12:19.165
Remote control.

12:19.248 --> 12:23.290
These fuckin' things. You can't
turn these thing on anymore
without a remote control.

12:23.373 --> 12:24.706
Ridiculous.

12:25.873 --> 12:28.165
Erol, do you want kids?

12:29.998 --> 12:32.165
I just wanna know
where the remote control is.

12:32.248 --> 12:35.623
Are you ready to have kids?

12:35.706 --> 12:37.539
Ah... yeah.

12:39.082 --> 12:40.332
OK, fine. You know what?

12:40.414 --> 12:41.748
If you're ready to have kids,

12:41.831 --> 12:43.165
then I'm just gonna take
your own sperm

12:43.248 --> 12:45.165
and stick it right
in my fucking cunt.

12:45.248 --> 12:47.123
I'm gonna stick your sperm
right in here.

12:47.207 --> 12:48.498
- Don't do that.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no.

12:48.581 --> 12:49.873
You can't get pregnant
that way anyway.

12:49.956 --> 12:51.332
Do you know how
you can get pregnant?

12:51.414 --> 12:52.790
This is exactly
how you can get pregnant.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.290
You stick the sperm
into your vagina.

12:55.373 --> 12:57.539
- That's how it works.
- That's very unhygienic.

12:57.623 --> 13:00.623
We actually told
our unborn Victoria.

13:00.706 --> 13:03.414
- Don't do that.
Stop doing that.
- No. Hey. Gimme--

13:03.498 --> 13:05.915
Stop doing it! Seriously.
That's not, like, healthy.

13:05.998 --> 13:07.581
Go, like, flush it out.

13:07.664 --> 13:10.748
If you get pregnant that way,
the baby's gonna be diseased.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.706
Go flush it out...
in the bathroom.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.414
Just go do that.
Flush it out. OK?

13:16.498 --> 13:19.831
- Wash it out.
- ( water running )

13:19.915 --> 13:22.123
( sighs )

13:22.207 --> 13:24.123
( water stops )

13:30.040 --> 13:32.539
- Get away from me.
- Go wash yourself.

13:32.623 --> 13:34.207
Go wash yourself. OK?

13:34.290 --> 13:36.623
You don't want kids at all.

13:37.790 --> 13:40.207
( sighs )

13:40.290 --> 13:42.581
I don't know what
to tell you, babe.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.748
I've already said it.
I've already told you.

13:46.831 --> 13:49.956
It was an accident.
Drop it, OK?

13:52.123 --> 13:55.082
I mean--
Please, look at me.

13:55.165 --> 13:56.873
No.

13:56.956 --> 13:58.373
What? You're-- OK?

13:58.456 --> 14:00.581
You are a fucking coward.

14:00.664 --> 14:01.915
What are you doing?

14:01.998 --> 14:03.414
I'm leaving.
I'm just leaving.

14:03.498 --> 14:04.915
I don't want
to be here anymore.

14:04.998 --> 14:06.332
I don't want to be around you,

14:06.414 --> 14:08.373
I don't even want to even
look at you.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.414
Rosie,
will you please--

14:10.498 --> 14:12.915
You're being ridiculous.

14:12.998 --> 14:15.539
To your unborn baby:
You need to know this
about your mom.

14:15.623 --> 14:18.040
- She's been very  patient.
- She's very histrionic

14:18.123 --> 14:20.248
if she doesn't get
what she wants
when she wants it.

14:20.332 --> 14:21.956
- Give me this.
- What are you--

14:22.040 --> 14:23.581
- You're packing?
- I'm packing.

14:23.664 --> 14:25.248
Are we on "Days of our Lives"?

14:25.332 --> 14:27.706
- What is this, a soap opera?
- Yeah. You know what?

14:27.790 --> 14:31.539
- Is that what--
- You already said
that you were ready!

14:31.623 --> 14:34.748
- Hey, that hurts!
- Two years ago! Two years!

14:34.831 --> 14:38.248
You know what else hurts?
Lies! Long-term lies!

14:38.332 --> 14:41.123
Hey, unborn baby, this is what
you got to look forward to, OK?

14:41.207 --> 14:44.373
- Imagine this--
- This is marriage! This is
as good as it fucking gets!

14:44.456 --> 14:46.706
- You're in your bedroom--
- I know! I've been in other
relationships,

14:46.790 --> 14:48.790
and they're all
fucking terrible!

14:48.873 --> 14:52.373
This is pretty much normal.
This is better  than normal,
actually.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.790
That's your mom there.
You're gonna come
into this world,

14:54.873 --> 14:56.581
- and that's what
you have to deal with.
- Long-term lies!

14:56.664 --> 14:58.498
And I don't just
want to leave him now;

14:58.581 --> 15:00.290
I've wanted to leave him
for so  long.

15:00.373 --> 15:02.123
I have
so many backup plans.

15:02.207 --> 15:04.414
I have a backup plan
for the backup plan
for the backup plan.

15:04.498 --> 15:05.790
There's the guy at Starbucks

15:05.873 --> 15:07.456
who's really nice
and kind of flirts

15:07.539 --> 15:09.956
every time I give him
an extra 50 fucking cents

15:10.040 --> 15:11.456
on his tips,

15:11.539 --> 15:13.873
or my friend Mikhaila,
I mean, she's a lesbian,

15:13.956 --> 15:15.956
I could be a lesbian,
I'm totally  interested
in being a lesbian,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.082
that would be so  much
better than this,

15:18.165 --> 15:21.040
and I would raise
my frickin' babies
on a farm, with goats!

15:21.123 --> 15:24.498
That'd be kids,
you know what I mean?
Kids and kids.

15:24.581 --> 15:27.040
Kids are goat babies.
Sheep doesn't enter into it.

15:27.123 --> 15:30.998
- You're gonna be crazy?
- Crazy? I'm crazy? Yeah.

15:31.082 --> 15:33.165
No, you ruined my chances
of having kids

15:33.248 --> 15:35.040
while I'm a fertile
human being!

15:35.123 --> 15:37.165
I'm not crazy.
I feel sane, actually.

15:37.248 --> 15:39.498
For the first time
in our whole relationship,
I feel sane.

15:39.581 --> 15:44.290
I'm saying what I think,
which is that you are
the most manipulative bastard

15:44.373 --> 15:46.123
on the history
of the planet.

15:46.207 --> 15:48.831
Actually, you might just be
as manipulative

15:48.915 --> 15:50.790
as every other human
on the planet,

15:50.873 --> 15:52.664
as every other male human,

15:52.748 --> 15:55.623
because you're all so cruel.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.790
Yeah.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.873
Yeah.

16:01.956 --> 16:03.998
Great.

16:04.082 --> 16:06.248
Did you get it all
out of your system?

16:06.332 --> 16:08.332
You feeling better now?

16:11.248 --> 16:13.664
I just really want
to have a kid.

16:13.748 --> 16:14.623
( sighs )

16:14.706 --> 16:16.207
At the end of the day,

16:16.290 --> 16:18.373
there are other rooms,
right?

16:18.456 --> 16:20.040
Other days.

16:20.123 --> 16:22.956
I already waited though
all the other days.

16:29.956 --> 16:33.373
I'm gonna sing you
a little tune as you leave.

16:33.456 --> 16:35.748
That's great,
take the Doritos.
That's great.

16:35.831 --> 16:37.748
( strumming )

16:37.831 --> 16:39.706
What is it?
Why are you looking
at me like that?!

16:39.790 --> 16:42.248
This is absurd!
We'll do it again
in a little while!

So you don't love me,
basically?

17:26.456 --> 17:28.290
Is that what you're saying?
Never did?

17:28.373 --> 17:30.706
I just wish I never had.

- Thank you.

( crying )
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm not ready.

18:42.790 --> 18:46.082
OK? I want to be.

18:46.165 --> 18:48.748
( sniffling )
I want to be.

18:50.207 --> 18:51.373
And you're so excited,

18:51.456 --> 18:52.664
and I know you want
to have a baby,

18:52.748 --> 18:54.664
and I look at you
and I-- and I...

18:54.748 --> 18:57.332
I want to be excited too,
but I'm terrified,

18:57.414 --> 18:59.248
and I just know,
I just know...

18:59.332 --> 19:02.082
I'm know I'm gonna
be a bad father
and I'm gonna lose you

19:02.165 --> 19:04.290

19:37.498 --> 19:40.290
I just feel really alone.

19:40.373 --> 19:43.748
I want to do this so much.

19:43.831 --> 19:46.664
I don't wanna do it by myself.

19:52.332 --> 19:54.623
Ohh.

19:54.706 --> 19:56.290
Uhhh.

19:58.956 --> 20:02.873
Erol, and I don't want to have
just any kid in the world.
