Gate.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.370
( rings bell )

03:28.750 --> 03:31.043
- What do you want?
- Can I use the bathroom here?

03:31.085 --> 03:33.587
I can't let you
back in here.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.380
This is the discharge gate.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.217
There's the last bus
into town tonight.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.968
You better get on it.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.021
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

05:14.105 --> 05:15.689
Yeah, it's down there.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.989
The bathroom's closed, sir.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.616
It's closed. Thanks.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.165
Excuse me, miss, do you know
where there's a bathroom here?

05:33.207 --> 05:34.499
Back there.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.335
That's closed. Do you know
where another bathroom is?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.920
There's one in the restaurant
to the left up there.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.339
Okay, thanks.
Thank you.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.098
( winces )

06:28.971 --> 06:30.972
Man: Oh man.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.174
The restaurant's closed.
I said the restaurant is closed.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.635
- Can I use the bathroom?
- The bathroom's closed, too.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.805
I said the restaurant
is closed.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.945
( tap dancing )

07:28.197 --> 07:31.366
...one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.244
One, two, three, four--
chin up straight-- seven, eight.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.622
And stamp! One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

07:37.665 --> 07:41.042
Stamp! Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.087
Stamp! And smile-- two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.424
Stamp! One, two,
three and four.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.135
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.596
Again-- two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.140
Repeat, two, two, two--
five, six, seven, eight.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.226
Stamp! Then a one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.438
Stamp! And smile-- two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.149
Stamp! And a one... three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.026
Doubles ! One, two...

08:10.531 --> 08:13.116
- What the fuck you looking at?
- Nothing.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.951
Then get your fucking face
out of my pants.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.286
Relax.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.580
Don't tell me to fucking relax.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.625
Just keep your face
out of my pants.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.627
It's just so big.

08:23.711 --> 08:27.130
What the fuck did you say?
What did you say to me, you faggot?

08:27.215 --> 08:30.634
Get the fuck out
of the bathroom ! Faggot!

08:31.719 --> 08:33.428
Damn it!

08:35.973 --> 08:38.475
I can't piss.
Fucking faggot,

08:38.559 --> 08:42.187
I'll kill that fucker!
Fucking faggot!

08:42.230 --> 08:43.730
Faggot!

08:45.191 --> 08:47.651
- Watch your mouth.
- What? What?

08:47.735 --> 08:51.613
Why don't you watch
your mouth, smart-ass?

08:53.991 --> 08:55.992
- Miss.
- What?

08:56.077 --> 08:57.536
You got a quarter
I can borrow?

08:57.620 --> 09:00.038
- Yes.
- Can I borrow it?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.623
Yeah.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.042
Can I borrow it now?

09:10.841 --> 09:12.717
- Don't you say thanks?
- What?

09:12.802 --> 09:15.637
- Don't you say thank you?
- What?

09:30.069 --> 09:33.238
Hello, Ma? It's me.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.699
It's Billy.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.620
Billy. Your son!

09:40.705 --> 09:44.457
Turn down the TV.
Turn down the television.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.042
It's Billy.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.089
I told you we were going to be
in town for one day, right?

09:51.173 --> 09:53.633
We're in town.
We just flew in.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.015
We're at the fancy hotel.
I told you where we were staying.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.435
Downtown, yes.
The big hotel, right.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.399
Yeah, I have a big room.
It's beautiful here.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.361
Yes, it's clean, Ma.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.197
It's a very expensive
hotel, okay?

10:18.909 --> 10:21.036
No, don't come here, Ma.
Don't come here.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.623
I told you, I want to go there.
I want to see the old neighborhood.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.209
I want to come now.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.422
What time is the game over?

10:33.883 --> 10:37.135
Fine, I'll come
at 5:00.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.013
No, Ma, she's not coming.
She's sick.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.057
I don't know.
People get sick.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.100
I don't know why she's sick.
She's sick.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.978
Every time we fly in planes,
she gets sick.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.064
I don't know why.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.607
She doesn't like flying.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.984
Plus, we sit in first class,
they bring you a lot of food,

10:53.027 --> 10:55.362
and she always gets
stomach cramps. I don't know.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.824
I can't--
she's sleeping, Ma.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.453
I'm in the lobby of the hotel
because she's sleeping upstairs.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.538
I'm not going to wake her up.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.708
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?

11:08.793 --> 11:11.169
What did I say?
What did I say?

11:11.253 --> 11:13.129
She's sick!

11:13.214 --> 11:16.174
Fine, Ma.
You want me to wake her up?

11:16.258 --> 11:18.843
You want me to go upstairs
and wake her up?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.012
You're unbelievable.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.973
Then how you going to feel
when she comes over sick?

11:24.058 --> 11:26.976
How you going to feel then
when you see how sick she is?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.353
No, I'm going to
bring her,

11:28.437 --> 11:30.647
I'm going to drag her out of bed
and I'm going to bring her to you

11:30.731 --> 11:32.190
so you can see her.

11:32.233 --> 11:35.652
Fine. We're coming over.
We're coming over.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.364
I said I'm bringing her, yes.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.200
Fine. Okay?
Goodbye.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.212
Excuse me, miss?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.220
Shut up, shut up...

12:03.431 --> 12:05.849
Don't say a word or I'll take it
right out of your face.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.601
Shut your mouth,
shut your mouth...

12:22.950 --> 12:25.535
Just shut your mouth
and you'll be okay.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.798
Man:
Shut up! Shut up!

12:40.134 --> 12:41.926
You're hurting me.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.637
Shut your mouth
or I'll really hurt you.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.973
Wanna really hurt?
Get in the car.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.726
Get in. Hurry up.
Get in the car.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.062
How do I get this thing back?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.898
Point to the thing!

12:59.737 --> 13:01.488
I can't see out the window.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.490
Give me something
to wipe the window with.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.201
Give me something
to wipe the window with!

13:06.285 --> 13:08.620
No, you go out.
You clean it.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.623
Get out of the car
and clean your window.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.041
Don't you ever
clean your window?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.793
Do you ever think
about cleaning your car--

13:14.877 --> 13:16.252
Come on, I don't got all day.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.171
Hurry up.

13:18.255 --> 13:22.258
See how you wash a car?
See how nice when a car's clean?

13:22.343 --> 13:25.136
Is that how your house is,
filthy like that?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.388
You see how nice the car is
when it's clean?

13:27.473 --> 13:28.765
You see,
now you can see.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.225
That's good. That's good.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.602
Get in your car.
Hurry up.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.606
Hurry up! And shut your mouth,
shut your mouth.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.359
It's filthy, it's filthy.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.657
Where's the thing
on this car?

13:45.699 --> 13:47.450
How do you put it in gear?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.993
- It's right here.
- What is this?

13:49.078 --> 13:51.329
Is this a shifter car?

13:51.372 --> 13:54.958
I cannot drive a shifter car,
so we got a little situation here.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.461
I can't drive these kind of cars.
What the fuck is going on?

13:58.546 --> 14:01.130
You think that's funny?
Would you like to know, smart-ass?

14:01.215 --> 14:03.424
Would you like to know why
I can't drive this kind of car?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.342
I'll tell you why.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.554
I'm used to luxury cars.
Have you ever heard of a luxury car?

14:07.638 --> 14:10.348
You know what luxury means?
Have you ever heard of Cadillac?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.600
Cadillac Eldorado?
That's what I drive.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.980
I drive cars that shift themselves.
My cars shift themselves.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.523
They're luxury cars.
They shift themselves.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.567
When I say three,
you follow my count,

14:20.609 --> 14:23.027
you come around to my door.
You got me?

14:23.070 --> 14:27.198
One... two... three.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.493
What did I just say?
One, two, three.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.495
Get out of the car.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.874
I'm watching you,
I'm watching you.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.253
Don't make that face,
don't make that face.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.797
Hurry up!

14:46.635 --> 14:48.177
Now pull away.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.890
Go this way!

14:51.932 --> 14:53.600
Wait! Go this way!

15:07.865 --> 15:10.575
I want you to
pull over right there.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.118
- Just pull over here.
- Where?

15:12.202 --> 15:14.037
Right here.
That's it, that's good.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.663
That's it. Beautiful.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.543
Put the car in park,
all right?

15:22.212 --> 15:24.631
I'm gonna step out
of the car for one minute.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.798
One minute,
I'm gonna step out.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.593
Put your hands
on the dashboard like that.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.137
Don't let me see
you move them one finger,

15:31.180 --> 15:34.098
not one twitch of a move or I'll
come back and choke you to death.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.350
I swear to God.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.061
I'll take a bite out of your cheek
and I'll shit you out.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.104
So just hold your hands
like that, you understand me?

15:40.147 --> 15:41.481
Nod your head
if you understand.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.400
You understand?
Yes, you understand.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.486
Stay right there.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.264
Don't look.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.277
Who told you to look?

16:38.414 --> 16:40.957
Take your hands off the dash.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.210
You're making me nervous.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.347
First thing,
right off the bat,

16:56.432 --> 16:59.434
I'd like to apologize.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.769
I'm going to apologize.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.105
I've had to go
to the bathroom for hours.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.649
I've been backed up,
totally backed up.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.820
Anyway, I swear to God,
I didn't mean to scare you.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.406
And I'm sorry
if I pulled your hair.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.616
You okay?

17:15.701 --> 17:18.703
Good. All right...

17:18.787 --> 17:22.498
Now don't talk, please.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.709
I need to ask you a favor.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.503
I haven't seen my parents
in a long time

17:27.588 --> 17:30.423
'cause I just got out of jail.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.425
I was innocent.

17:34.094 --> 17:37.513
Before I went away,
I made up a few lies.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.265
I said I was married.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.018
I also told them
that I worked for the government

17:42.102 --> 17:44.187
and that I would be away
for a long time.

17:44.271 --> 17:48.274
What I need you to do is to come
to my parents' house with me,

17:48.358 --> 17:50.651
and pretend to be my wife--

17:50.736 --> 17:52.236
acting, all right?

17:52.237 --> 17:55.073
Today's your big debut,
your big break.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.241
This is acting.
You're my wife.

17:57.326 --> 18:01.245
So that means you adore me,
you love me, you cherish me--

18:01.288 --> 18:04.373
Jesus Christ,
you can't live without me.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.918
The story will go
like this.

18:07.002 --> 18:10.546
We met in high school...

18:10.631 --> 18:12.757
and we were sweethearts,
you loved me,

18:12.841 --> 18:15.384
you've been in love with me
your whole life.

18:15.469 --> 18:19.263
And your new name
would be Wendy Balsam.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.265
Don't worry
about the details.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.767
I'll take over.
Just be nice.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.395
When we get there,
be a decent girl. Be nice.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.441
What's your name,
what's your real name?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.402
Layla.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.905
Layla.
No, that's no good.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.199
We'll stick with Wendy Balsam,
you're Wendy Balsam.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.827
So basically,
what I'm asking you to do is,

18:40.911 --> 18:44.413
I'm asking you to come there
and make me look good.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.875
And if you make a fool out of me,
I swear to God,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.294
I'll kill you right there.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.631
Boom ! Right in front
of Mommy and Daddy.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.175
And I'll tell you something else,
you make me look bad...

18:56.218 --> 19:00.471
I will never ever
talk to you again, ever.

19:00.514 --> 19:04.684
But if you do a good job,
then you can be my best friend.

19:04.768 --> 19:08.146
My best friend that
I've ever had. You hear me?

19:10.023 --> 19:12.775
All right,
let's keep driving.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.278
We're gonna go.
Keep driving.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.572
Layla:
What's your name?

19:17.656 --> 19:20.783
My name is Billy,
Billy Brown.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.252
Just remember
why you're there.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.839
You're there to make me
look good. You hear me?

19:34.923 --> 19:39.218
You can eat all the food you want,
just make me look good.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.096
- Why are you there?
- To make you look good.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.056
That's right,
to make me look good.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.266
Then you can go home.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.020
Are your parents vegetarians?

19:49.104 --> 19:52.607
I hope so, because
I don't eat meat ever.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.587
Come on, come on.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.272
- Which house is it?
- There.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.746
( distant cheering )

20:53.043 --> 20:54.919
Oh man.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.926
Are you okay?

21:02.010 --> 21:03.970
What did I tell you?

21:04.054 --> 21:05.763
Just make sure
you behave right.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.271
Come on, come on.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.649
- What did I tell you?
- Don't start.

21:17.734 --> 21:22.655
Do me this favor, all right?
This is not nice.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.741
Just be nice, okay?

21:25.826 --> 21:28.995
Be nice, say hello,
really nice hellos.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.706
My father likes
when people say hello.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.625
"Hello, Mr. Brown."
Okay? Please.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.134
Are you sure you're okay?

21:45.012 --> 21:46.721
Billy:
I feel sick.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.809
I feel like throwing up.

21:57.941 --> 22:00.026
Would you hold me
a second?

22:00.110 --> 22:02.236
- ( cheering inside)
- Would you hold me?

22:02.321 --> 22:07.366
Don't touch me.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.328
Come on. Come on.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.999
( rings bell )

22:16.710 --> 22:19.003
( distant cheering )

22:20.756 --> 22:22.673
- ( rings bell )
- Hello!

22:22.758 --> 22:26.344
- ( TV plays )
- ( woman cheers )

22:29.514 --> 22:31.349
Billy:
Hey, Dad.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.811
Dad:
Jan, it's your son.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.523
- Jan: Who?
- Dad: I said it's your son.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.028
Oh, honey.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.946
It's Billy.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.656
Billy's here.

22:50.619 --> 22:57.833
( crowd cheers on TV )

23:09.471 --> 23:11.764
We're so happy
to meet you.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.766
Billy's told us
so much about you.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.101
Oh.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.603
I've heard so much
about both of you.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.022
He's very proud you two.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.982
Do you think I could use
the bathroom?

23:22.067 --> 23:25.403
Sure, honey. Billy, go show her
where the bathroom is.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.408
It's down the hall.
Don't take a long time.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.701
I have to go to the bathroom.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.412
Just hurry up.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.838
Honey... you look tired.
Are you sick?

23:43.922 --> 23:46.382
I'm not sick, Ma.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.094
Why?

23:50.178 --> 23:52.430
You just--

23:52.472 --> 23:54.515
you just look so tired.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.768
Well, Ma, I am a little tired.
I just flew on a plane.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.396
- Okay?
- All right. Don't get upset.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.731
- I'm not upset.
- All right.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.111
You want something to drink?

24:07.195 --> 24:08.737
Yeah.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.866
All right.
What do you want to drink?

24:11.950 --> 24:14.535
I'd like a glass
of water, please.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.912
You don't want some pop?

24:17.998 --> 24:20.124
You know
I don't drink pop, Ma.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.751
The bubbles bother
my stomach.

24:22.836 --> 24:26.755
Would you like some ginger ale?
I got some ginger ale.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.757
That's good for the stomach.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.801
Ginger ale is pop, Ma.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.553
Ginger ale is pop.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.138
I just said
I don't want pop.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.806
Can I please have
a glass of water?

24:35.891 --> 24:39.351
How about I make you the juice?
I got the frozen juice.

24:39.394 --> 24:42.605
I just want a glass
of water, please.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.691
Just a glass of water.
That's all I want.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.735
- Fine.
- Thank you.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.908
Jan:
Ooh, honey.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.911
I got those chocolate doughnuts
you like. Do you want one now

24:56.995 --> 24:59.955
or do you think
it'll spoil your appetite?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.124
It won't spoil
my appetite.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.127
I don't eat chocolate.
I'm allergic to it, remember?

25:07.047 --> 25:08.047
Honey...

25:08.131 --> 25:11.550
what are you talking about?
You always ate chocolate.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.511
That's great.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.513
You don't remember your own son.
That's really great...

25:15.555 --> 25:18.849
Ma, my face is
kind of itchy.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.562
Honey, what happened
to your face?

25:23.647 --> 25:27.191
It's all swollen.
We better put some ice on that.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.818
Billy: ...you had to take me
to the Emergency Room

25:29.903 --> 25:31.070
because my face swelled up.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.492
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:36.576 --> 25:37.952
You always ate chocolate.

25:38.036 --> 25:42.331
I didn't always eat chocolate, Ma.
I did not always eat chocolate.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.501
I didn't eat chocolate.
Can we talk about something else?

25:45.585 --> 25:48.379
- All right, just calm down.
- Fine.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.383
- Honey.
- Hi, honey.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.107
Why don't you get her
something to drink, Ma?

26:08.191 --> 26:10.776
All right. Do you want
something to drink, honey?

26:10.860 --> 26:14.238
Yeah. Could you make me
a rum and coke?

26:14.322 --> 26:16.532
- What, honey?
- I meant--

26:16.616 --> 26:21.287
- could I have a ginger ale?
- Oh sure, we got a ginger ale.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.372
Come here, honey.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.583
Let me hug
my new little daughter.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.669
Daddy loves you, you know that?
Daddy really loves you.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.422
His new, little, sweet,
young daughter.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.340
Sit down, honey.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.055
I'm 28.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.766
You look like a baby.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.893
You look so young and pretty.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.604
Thank you.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.565
My son used to be
a beautiful baby.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.733
Oh !

26:50.817 --> 26:53.777
You should've seen him.
He was so beautiful.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.866
Look at him now.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.909
Oh no.

27:00.994 --> 27:04.538
I think Billy is the most
handsome guy in the whole world.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.124
- Who, honey?
- Billy.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.210
I think he's the most
handsome man I've ever seen.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.589
- Billy who?
- This Billy.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.091
Oh.

27:16.176 --> 27:19.845
I can't stand it
when he grows his hair long.

27:23.224 --> 27:26.185
Could I see some pictures
of Billy from when he was little?

27:26.269 --> 27:28.437
You want to see
some pictures?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.898
Honey,
where's the Billy picture?

27:30.982 --> 27:33.734
- You know?
- I don't know where it is.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.653
The picture
of Billy, honey.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.155
I don't know where it is.
Wait a minute...

27:38.198 --> 27:40.616
We got some pictures.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.665
Here's a picture of me
with Jack Kemp.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.336
Here's OJ Simpson.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.382
Here's me with
the Buffalo Bills' caterer.

27:59.844 --> 28:03.472
Here's my husband.
Here's our wedding.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.267
Honey, did you find it?

28:09.437 --> 28:11.188
Yeah, I found it.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.943
Look at Billy.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.570
He's so cute.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.865
And that puppy--
that puppy's adorable.

28:21.908 --> 28:24.326
- Whose puppy is that?
- That was Billy's.

28:24.411 --> 28:27.705
- Bingo.
- What happened to him?

28:27.747 --> 28:29.665
I don't know
what happened to him.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.376
He ran away.
Yeah, he ran away.

28:33.628 --> 28:36.088
Such a cute puppy.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.090
- ( dog whines )
- Billy!

28:38.174 --> 28:40.092
What did I tell you
about this thing?

28:40.176 --> 28:42.511
Didn't I warn you
50 fucking times about this dog?

28:42.554 --> 28:44.888
Didn't I tell you if it peed
in the house again what I'd do?

28:44.931 --> 28:47.266
- No, Daddy, please!
- Didn't I tell you?

28:47.350 --> 28:50.060
- ( dog whines )
- No, Daddy, please!

28:53.898 --> 28:56.233
That's enough with
the pictures. I'm hungry.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.777
Jan, would you
hurry up, please?

28:58.820 --> 29:02.114
Who's this handsome guy
in this picture?

29:02.198 --> 29:04.700
That's me.
I was a singer.

29:04.784 --> 29:08.412
That's me in a downtown
nightclub with this band...

29:08.455 --> 29:12.291
Sinatra sang in that club.
He sang in that actual club.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.251
Wow, you're a singer?

29:14.335 --> 29:16.712
Well, I was a singer.

29:18.256 --> 29:19.423
Yeah.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.217
Did you ever make any records?
Do you have any tapes?

29:22.302 --> 29:23.886
No, no...

29:23.970 --> 29:26.430
well, a few tapes.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.265
Can I hear one?

29:28.308 --> 29:30.434
You want to hear
one of my tapes?

29:30.518 --> 29:33.312
All right. As soon as we eat,
I'll play you a tape.

29:33.396 --> 29:36.482
Honey, it's going to be 20 minutes
before I'm done with dinner.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.942
Why don't you
play her the tapes now?

29:41.488 --> 29:43.822
- You really want to hear this?
- Yes.

29:43.907 --> 29:46.116
Okay, follow me.

30:06.012 --> 30:10.682
These are some arrangements
Nelson Riddle made for Frank,

30:10.767 --> 30:12.643
without Frank's voice,
of course,

30:12.727 --> 30:15.270
so he could see what he liked,
what he didn't like.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.773
I like to sing to them.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.861
Let me find the hole here.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.366
I hope I can still
get up there.

- Let's go and eat.
- Can I hear one more?

33:15.243 --> 33:16.868
No. I'm hungry.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.912
I'm shaking with hunger--

33:18.997 --> 33:21.832
- Please, just one more song.
- No more ! Okay?

33:27.130 --> 33:30.757
I'm sorry, honey.
Jesus Christ.

33:30.842 --> 33:34.386
Listen, when we finish eating,

33:34.470 --> 33:36.847
I'll look around,
find a tape for you.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.516
You take it home, play it
any time you want, okay?

33:39.559 --> 33:40.517
Okay.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.562
'Cause Daddy loves you,
you know that? I love you.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.314
Let's go.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.717
Billy, you're right.

34:13.801 --> 34:16.053
Your father does have
the most beautiful voice.

34:19.182 --> 34:22.684
Jan: Careful, everybody.
It's very hot.

34:22.769 --> 34:26.480
- I hope you like tripe.
- I don't know what that is.

34:26.564 --> 34:29.900
The Italians call it "trippa."
It's the intestines of the cow.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.152
And it's very good for you.

34:34.155 --> 34:37.657
It's terrific. Isn't that what
you said was your favorite food?

34:37.742 --> 34:40.160
Go ahead, honey.
Tell me what you think.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.996
Go ahead, Wendy.
Take a big bite.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.332
Take a big bigger bite.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.667
Mmm, that's good, right?

34:47.752 --> 34:50.962
Bring more, Ma. She's going to
eat a lot, I sense it.

34:51.047 --> 34:54.591
Well, everybody
gets the same.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.057
Dad: Turn that knife
away from me, please.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.017
Why are you pointing
that knife at me?

35:04.102 --> 35:07.187
Is that why you came here
to stab me with that knife?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.356
Will you turn it
away from me, please?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.566
- Honey, just calm down.
- Turn it away, please !

35:11.651 --> 35:14.319
What? The knife is not
pointed at you !

35:14.403 --> 35:15.904
Yes, it's pointed at me!

35:15.947 --> 35:17.864
Don't tell me you didn't
point the knife at me!

35:17.949 --> 35:20.408
Don't point a knife at a person
unless you want to use it!

35:20.493 --> 35:23.703
I didn't point the knife at you!
It was here on the table, like that!

35:23.788 --> 35:26.164
It was not here!
Point it over here!

35:26.249 --> 35:28.458
Honey, just calm down.

35:28.543 --> 35:32.546
I am calm! Did you see what he did?
Did you see what your son did?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.631
- I didn't do nothing!
- He pointed a knife at his father!

35:34.715 --> 35:37.217
Yeah, I pointed at you,
it's always at you.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.470
Honey, honey, honey.
Do you want some more tripe?

35:40.555 --> 35:43.098
No, I don't want tripe.
You want to get me tripe,

35:43.182 --> 35:46.893
- get me tripe.
- No, let him fill up on the bread.

35:46.978 --> 35:50.230
- Enough tripe.
- Let me eat bread,

35:50.314 --> 35:53.108
'cause that's what he wants me
to eat-- bread all the time !

35:53.192 --> 35:56.027
God forbid I should have
a piece of meat, right?

35:56.112 --> 35:58.738
So, Wendy, you were saying?

36:00.616 --> 36:03.493
I was just going to say...

36:03.578 --> 36:06.997
how Billy's the nicest husband
in the whole world.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.249
Yeah, I'm sure
he's terrific.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.209
No, really,
I'm the luckiest girl

36:11.294 --> 36:14.296
to have found
such a wonderful husband.

36:14.380 --> 36:17.549
I fell in love with him
the first time I met him.

36:20.011 --> 36:23.555
Honey, can you pass me
the remote control there?

36:23.639 --> 36:25.515
It's right behind you.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.687
Did Billy ever tell you
how we met?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.774
No, honey.
How did you two meet?

36:34.859 --> 36:38.153
Layla: Billy, you didn't tell
your mom how we met?

36:39.572 --> 36:41.281
You tell her.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.701
Well...

36:44.785 --> 36:47.454
I was working as a typist
for the CIA,

36:47.538 --> 36:49.497
which is a special part
of the government,

36:49.582 --> 36:52.250
and Billy is
a top agent with the CIA.

36:52.335 --> 36:55.837
I'm sure you know that.
You're probably so proud of him.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.381
He has hundreds of people
working for him.

36:58.424 --> 37:01.051
And all the girls in the office
were always telling me

37:01.135 --> 37:03.053
how much they were in love
with their boss.

37:03.095 --> 37:04.638
And of course,
I had never seen him.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.098
I worked way down on the other side
of the building.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.768
But one day he comes
into the office,

37:09.852 --> 37:11.937
and I see him.

37:12.021 --> 37:15.398
And I fell in love,
madly in love with him.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.275
But I couldn't talk to him

37:17.360 --> 37:19.861
'cause I was
just a typist.

37:19.946 --> 37:23.365
He's the kindest,
smartest,

37:23.449 --> 37:25.659
most handsome guy there.

37:25.743 --> 37:29.246
Even the guys loved him.
They idolized him.

37:29.330 --> 37:32.082
So I just couldn't--

37:32.124 --> 37:33.917
I didn't think
he'd ever like me.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.419
I was just
a little typist girl,

37:36.504 --> 37:38.713
and he was like the king.

37:38.798 --> 37:42.050
Even the President is
so proud of him.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.929
So one day, I walk
into my office,

37:46.013 --> 37:50.058
and there's this giant
bouquet of roses.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.726
And I was just like,
"My God,

37:51.811 --> 37:53.603
what are those flowers
on my desk?"

37:53.646 --> 37:56.523
I thought maybe they had gotten
the wrong desk or something.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.859
So I go to open the card--
there's a little note attached.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.404
And it said, "Dear Wendy,

38:02.488 --> 38:04.531
I've been in love with you
for a year,

38:04.615 --> 38:08.535
but I'm very shy and I just
didn't know how to tell you.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.371
But I want you to know
that I really love you,

38:11.455 --> 38:13.999
and I'd like to take you
to dinner sometime."

38:14.083 --> 38:15.917
And guess who
it was signed by.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.210
Who?

38:17.295 --> 38:20.297
Honey, hold on,
watch this play...

38:20.381 --> 38:22.299
Billy!
It was signed by Billy.

38:22.341 --> 38:26.636
- It said, "Love, Billy."
- Just watch this play.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.263
Watch this.

38:29.056 --> 38:30.890
( crowd cheering on TV )

38:41.152 --> 38:44.779
God damn it!

38:47.867 --> 38:50.618
30 years,
I haven't missed a game.

38:50.703 --> 38:54.122
They haven't won
a championship since 1966.

38:54.165 --> 38:58.043
And I missed that game 'cause
that's the day I had Billy.

39:00.546 --> 39:03.214
I wish I never had him.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.675
I wouldn't have
missed that game.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.890
Did you like Buffalo, too?

39:16.520 --> 39:18.480
It's Billy Brown calling.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.360
I'd like to bet
on the Superbowl.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.823
On Buffalo.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.743
To win.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.663
Right.

39:43.756 --> 39:46.007
I'd like to put
$10,000 on them.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.675
$10,000?!

39:47.760 --> 39:50.428
- That's too much !
- I'm talking on the phone!

39:50.513 --> 39:51.888
I'm talking on the phone.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.849
Billy: Come on, Scott.
Come on, Scott.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.227
Please, God.
Please, God.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.273
- Commentator: No good.
- Both: Oh no!

40:02.358 --> 40:04.484
- Billy: Fuck!
- I told you, Billy.

40:04.568 --> 40:08.363
- Now you're in big trouble.
- Shut up! I'm fucked.

40:13.828 --> 40:16.204
Man:
The story goes like this.

40:16.247 --> 40:20.291
One day,
this big asshole comes in.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.461
He calls up
a $10,000 bet on Buffalo

40:23.546 --> 40:25.338
to win the Superbowl.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.966
That's to win, okay?

40:28.050 --> 40:31.636
I know what you're thinking.
This story's hard to believe.

40:32.721 --> 40:35.723
What kind of an idiot
would bet...

40:37.059 --> 40:39.269
on Buffalo to win
a big game like that?

40:40.646 --> 40:42.939
It's true.
I swear to God it happened.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.817
This guy was
so out of touch,

40:45.901 --> 40:49.446
he didn't even have the 10 large
to cover his bet.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.242
Tell somebody
to turn up the heat.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.537
So, Billy...

40:57.621 --> 41:00.331
what happened was
this bookie got so sick

41:00.416 --> 41:03.126
of hearing
everybody's excuses--

41:04.170 --> 41:07.547
they're all the same.
Everybody's got an excuse.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.924
Anyway, this bookie
got so sick

41:10.009 --> 41:11.926
that he just had...

41:12.011 --> 41:13.470
to throw up.

41:14.597 --> 41:17.807
The only way he could
make himself feel better

41:17.850 --> 41:20.310
was to do bad things.

41:22.521 --> 41:27.108
To do very, very bad things
to the excuse-maker.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.028
And very, very bad things

41:30.112 --> 41:33.114
to the excuse-maker's
mother and father.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.826
So what do you say?

41:36.911 --> 41:40.121
Why don't we give
this story a happy ending?

41:40.206 --> 41:43.082
I've got an acquaintance,
a friend,

41:43.167 --> 41:46.002
a very good friend of ours

41:46.045 --> 41:47.837
who just got arrested.

41:47.922 --> 41:50.256
Of course, he's innocent.

41:51.592 --> 41:54.511
His arrest is
a goddamn injustice,

41:54.553 --> 41:55.887
a tragedy.

41:55.971 --> 41:58.389
So you, the asshole,

41:58.474 --> 42:02.227
will confess to the crime
of which he is accused,

42:02.311 --> 42:05.063
so as to free
the innocent man.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.648
Now...

42:06.732 --> 42:10.235
if you fail
to convince the court...

42:12.029 --> 42:14.489
or if you refuse to try to,

42:14.573 --> 42:18.868
some very evil and very
bad things could happen.

42:18.911 --> 42:22.247
Very evil and
very bad things.

42:23.582 --> 42:25.041
And Billy...

42:25.125 --> 42:28.211
if Buffalo ever makes it
back to the Superbowl,

42:28.295 --> 42:30.255
bet against them.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.800
Now get the fuck
out of my sight.

42:39.598 --> 42:40.890
Bailiff: All rise.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.686
Mr. Brown,

42:44.770 --> 42:48.356
based on your confession,
you are found guilty as charged.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.733
Therefore, it is
the judgment of this court

42:50.818 --> 42:53.403
that you are sentenced
to the maximum term--

42:53.487 --> 42:56.155
five years, no parole.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.206
Billy:
This one is going to go in June.

43:05.332 --> 43:08.585
See how I've been doing it?
I write them down on every envelope.

43:08.627 --> 43:11.170
You don't have to think.
This goes in June.

43:11.255 --> 43:16.759
Any day in June.

43:16.802 --> 43:19.470
Just look at the thing,
like all the other ones.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.806
You look at the month--

43:21.890 --> 43:24.642
Goon, pay attention,
we're almost done.

43:24.727 --> 43:26.769
See, June?
This one says June.

43:26.854 --> 43:28.021
They all have a month mark.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.272
This one goes June.

43:29.315 --> 43:32.442
June comes before
July and after May.

43:32.484 --> 43:35.028
So any time you hear
that it's June,

43:35.112 --> 43:37.655
just put this in
the mailbox, all right?

43:37.740 --> 43:40.074
Can I trust you on these?
Are we done with these?

43:41.160 --> 43:43.119
You got it.
They've all got their own month.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.079
Any day of the month,
you can send it.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.874
The month is written
on the back of the thing.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.168
This one goes
at Christmas-time.

43:50.252 --> 43:52.962
Please don't pick your nose
in front of me.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.381
Please don't do that.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.634
All right? This goes
at Christmas-time.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.928
Christmas. Do you know
when Christmas is?

44:01.013 --> 44:03.473
- I know when Christmas is.
- You know, Rudolph...

44:03.515 --> 44:05.516
What do you think,
I'm dumb?

44:07.478 --> 44:09.854
Yeah, I think you're
a little dumb sometimes.

44:09.938 --> 44:12.440
Cut it out, Billy,
or I'm not gonna do it.

44:12.483 --> 44:15.318
Listen to me.
Wanna know what I heard in here?

44:15.361 --> 44:18.237
Wanna know what I heard?
You know Scott Wood?

44:18.322 --> 44:22.784
I heard from guys in here
who know for a fact--

44:22.868 --> 44:24.827
they know for a fact

44:24.912 --> 44:27.455
that he missed that fucking
field goal on purpose.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.833
That he got paid money
and he missed it on purpose.

44:30.876 --> 44:33.836
That motherfuck.
That motherfuck.

44:33.879 --> 44:37.215
I wonder how much
that motherfuck got paid

44:37.299 --> 44:39.967
to ruin my fucking life.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.637
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.

44:42.721 --> 44:44.138
Listen to me.

44:44.223 --> 44:47.642
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

44:47.726 --> 44:50.812
I swear to God,
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

44:50.896 --> 44:53.648
That motherfucking,
10-cent field goal kicker,

44:53.732 --> 44:54.899
I'm gonna kill him.

44:54.983 --> 44:56.234
And I'll tell you something,

44:56.318 --> 44:58.319
I'll kill myself, too,
'cause I don't give a fuck,

44:58.404 --> 45:02.115
'cause I'm not coming back here,
you understand?

45:02.199 --> 45:04.367
Just remember
what I told you.

45:05.911 --> 45:09.247
What are you looking at?

45:12.751 --> 45:14.711
You got this, right?

45:14.753 --> 45:16.546
You got this and this.

45:16.630 --> 45:19.507
When is this one going?
This one is going in January.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.718
This is for
my mother's birthday.

45:21.760 --> 45:25.430
January. Let me write it down
on every package.

45:25.514 --> 45:26.681
January.

45:26.765 --> 45:29.559
Goon, please, please
don't fuck me here.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.227
Please be a person...

45:34.940 --> 45:37.024
Can I use the phone
in the bedroom?

45:37.109 --> 45:38.234
Sure, you can.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.777
Where are you calling?
Local call?

45:39.862 --> 45:41.904
- Yes, a local call.
- Okay.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.459
( phone rings )

46:07.890 --> 46:11.434
Goon, it's me, Billy.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.478
What are you doing?

46:13.562 --> 46:14.937
Billy...

46:14.980 --> 46:17.982
I don't want people
to call me that no more,

46:18.066 --> 46:19.942
even you.

46:19.985 --> 46:22.445
Billy:
Hello to you, too.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.989
What do they call you now?

46:25.032 --> 46:27.617
What do you want them
to call you?

46:27.701 --> 46:30.411
My new name is Rocky.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.205
( laughs )

46:32.289 --> 46:34.499
Your name is Rocky?

46:34.583 --> 46:36.501
Goon:
My new name is Rocky.

46:36.585 --> 46:37.585
Rocky.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.587
I go away for two seconds

46:39.630 --> 46:42.924
and you change your name
from Goon to Rocky.

46:44.384 --> 46:47.929
Whatever you want.

46:49.556 --> 46:51.516
I just got out of jail.

46:51.600 --> 46:55.061
You remember that guy, Wood?

46:56.522 --> 46:58.481
I'd really like to find him.

46:58.524 --> 47:03.986
Are you still going to do
that bad thing you said you'd do?

47:04.029 --> 47:08.574
Don't you think that's not
a good thing to do?

47:08.659 --> 47:11.118
What if the policeman
catches you?

47:11.203 --> 47:13.496
Billy:
I'm not going to get caught.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.665
I'm not going to get caught.

47:15.707 --> 47:18.417
So you want to help me
or you don't want to help me?

47:18.502 --> 47:23.089
Goon: He's got that TV commercial,
and he's got that club

47:23.173 --> 47:25.675
where the girls take off
their clothes.

47:25.759 --> 47:29.554
Billy: What? This guy opens up
a strip joint in Buffalo?

47:29.638 --> 47:32.348
You want to come over
to my house for dinner?

47:32.432 --> 47:34.600
My mom's cooking dinner.

47:34.685 --> 47:36.519
What's the name
of the club?

47:38.272 --> 47:40.565
- Hey, Goon?
- Huh?

47:40.649 --> 47:42.859
Billy:
What's the name of the joint?

47:42.901 --> 47:47.488
Oh, it's the name of his name.
It's got his name.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.740
It's named-- yeah.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.909
Do you know a street?
Can you help me out?

47:51.994 --> 47:53.744
Can you give me
a street name?

47:53.829 --> 47:55.830
Goon: You're confusing me.
I don't know.

47:55.914 --> 47:57.498
I don't remember.

47:57.583 --> 48:00.501
You shouldn't go down there.
Don't go down there.

48:00.752 --> 48:04.422
I have a little surprise
I haven't told Billy yet.

48:04.506 --> 48:06.549
- Yeah?
- I'm pregnant.

48:06.633 --> 48:08.885
- We're going to have a baby.
- Wendy, honey,

48:08.927 --> 48:11.053
you're going
to have a baby!

48:11.096 --> 48:13.681
- You're going to have a baby!
- Don't tell Billy,

48:13.724 --> 48:15.683
'cause I want
to surprise him later.

48:15.726 --> 48:19.312
- We won't say nothing.
- Come here, give me a hug!

48:23.275 --> 48:25.151
I won't say nothing.

48:26.361 --> 48:27.904
Goon...

48:27.988 --> 48:29.989
I'm just kidding, all right?

48:30.073 --> 48:31.574
I'm just kidding.

48:31.658 --> 48:33.951
I just want to go
and say hello to him.

48:34.036 --> 48:36.245
Can you help me find him?

48:36.288 --> 48:39.081
I know how you get.
Don't go down there.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.918
- You'll go back to jail.
- What did I just say?

48:42.002 --> 48:43.878
I said I was kidding.

48:43.962 --> 48:46.756
- You got a phone book in the house?
- Don't do bad things.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.133
Don't do any bad things.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.093
Did you get the raisins
that I sent you?

48:51.178 --> 48:53.596
Yeah, Goon, I got
the raisins. Thanks.

48:53.639 --> 48:56.641
Do you have a phone book?
Can you help me out here?

48:56.683 --> 48:59.936
Don't call me that.
I don't like that name no more.

49:00.020 --> 49:03.230
All right, Rocky.
Rocky! Rocky!

49:03.315 --> 49:05.650
I'll call you Rocky.
You happy, big shot?

49:05.734 --> 49:08.527
You happy, Rocky? What's
the difference what your name is?

49:08.612 --> 49:11.030
Would you do me a favor
and get a phone book?

49:11.114 --> 49:12.865
Goon: I've got to go.
My mom's calling me.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.867
She's mad that I'm
on the phone too long.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.161
You know something, Goon?

49:17.245 --> 49:20.122
You know your problem?
Your problem is your mother.

49:20.165 --> 49:22.124
That's all you do is you run

49:22.209 --> 49:23.793
when your mom calls you
all the time.

49:23.877 --> 49:26.253
Could you just get
a phone book?

49:27.673 --> 49:30.007
No, I've got to go.
My mom said I've got to go.

49:30.092 --> 49:31.759
I need you
for one second, Goon.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.636
One second.
Get a phone book.

49:33.679 --> 49:38.516
- Don't be sore at me, Billy.
- I asked you to get a phone book!

49:38.600 --> 49:40.601
Every time your mother
says something--

49:40.686 --> 49:42.812
that's why people
call you Goon.

49:42.896 --> 49:45.439
You know why they call you Goon?
Because you're retarded

49:45.524 --> 49:48.442
and you're ugly.
You're an ugly retard.

49:48.527 --> 49:51.278
And they call you Goon
because you're ugly and retarded.

49:51.363 --> 49:54.782
And you'll always be Goon.
Goon, Goon, Goon.

49:54.866 --> 49:57.034
That's what I'll call you
for the rest of your life.

49:57.119 --> 49:59.954
Goon, Goon, Goon,
Goon, Goon. Okay?

50:00.038 --> 50:01.664
So fuck you.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.336
Fuck.

50:19.599 --> 50:21.058
Oh, honey...

50:21.143 --> 50:23.227
you're going
to have a baby!

50:25.439 --> 50:27.982
It's really been a pleasure
having you here.

50:28.066 --> 50:30.693
And when you have a little one,
I want you to call it

50:30.777 --> 50:32.862
Little Jimmy.

50:32.946 --> 50:35.489
Honey, we love you so much.

50:35.574 --> 50:37.533
Honey, you come back soon,
all right?

50:37.576 --> 50:39.285
And you guys have
to come visit us, too.

50:39.369 --> 50:40.995
The house is
so beautiful.

50:41.079 --> 50:44.081
Billy's so handy. He's built
so many amazing things.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.208
Now you have another house.

50:46.293 --> 50:49.253
And I want you to give
your daddy a big kiss.

50:51.256 --> 50:54.216
Oh, honey,
we love you so much.

50:54.259 --> 50:57.053
- You come back and visit soon.
- We will.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.555
- Bye.
- Bye, honey.

51:07.731 --> 51:09.690
( game plays on TV )

51:09.775 --> 51:12.068
Jan: Ho, ho, ho, go!
Come on !

51:13.445 --> 51:17.281
- Billy: I can't believe them!
- No, it's good.

51:17.365 --> 51:20.451
It's good that they like me.
Then they'll be proud of you.

51:20.535 --> 51:22.953
Billy:
Bullshit! My life is shit.

51:23.038 --> 51:26.040
If you were my son,
I'd be really proud of you.

51:26.124 --> 51:28.334
Did you see them
kiss your ass?

51:28.418 --> 51:30.795
You made it happen.
You made them do that.

51:30.879 --> 51:34.131
( Layla scoffs )
You kidnapped me.

51:34.216 --> 51:37.134
You pulled my hair,
you threatened me.

51:37.219 --> 51:39.095
I just went in there
and did you a favor.

51:39.137 --> 51:41.889
- I thought I did a good job and--
- What was that shit about the CIA?

51:41.932 --> 51:44.600
I asked you "nice," I said "nice."

51:44.684 --> 51:46.227
"Make me look good !"

51:46.311 --> 51:48.854
CIA? Do you think
my father believed that?

51:48.939 --> 51:51.232
Do you think he'd believe that
for one second?

51:51.316 --> 51:53.526
Your son works for the CIA.
All the girls love him.

51:53.610 --> 51:56.570
He's smart! He's smart!

52:08.208 --> 52:09.792
Let's go.

52:33.984 --> 52:36.068
Hey!
Hey, look, everybody,

52:36.153 --> 52:38.320
the king is back.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.948
Billy: That's right.
The king is here.

52:41.032 --> 52:43.742
- Billy Brown.
- What's up? Nice to see you.

52:43.827 --> 52:46.287
- It's nice to see you.
- You look really good.

52:46.371 --> 52:49.081
Really good.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.375
So, you guys keep
my ball and stuff?

52:51.459 --> 52:54.211
Did we keep your ball?

52:54.296 --> 52:57.464
We got your ball, your locker...

52:57.549 --> 53:00.217
- You better have kept it.
- ...just like you left it.

53:00.302 --> 53:01.927
All right.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.683
What?
Did you pay my membership?

53:07.726 --> 53:09.518
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

53:09.561 --> 53:11.854
You weren't here to pay it,

53:11.897 --> 53:14.356
so I paid it for you.
'Cause I'm your friend, right?

53:14.399 --> 53:16.692
- Used your own money?
- Yeah.

53:16.735 --> 53:19.653
- All right, I owe you for that.
- You're my friend.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.739
You're my friend, too.

53:21.823 --> 53:24.783
Any good bowlers around
these days, anybody good?

53:25.869 --> 53:28.120
- Just you, Billy.
- All right.

53:29.372 --> 53:32.333
- Who's the girl?
- I'm his wife.

53:32.417 --> 53:35.920
She's not my wife.
I picked her up hitchhiking.

53:36.004 --> 53:39.215
Five years in the joint,
you don't waste any time.

53:39.299 --> 53:40.883
You know me.

53:43.094 --> 53:45.429
So I'll go get my things
out of the locker.

53:45.513 --> 53:47.890
I gave you 13.
That's the one you like, right?

53:47.933 --> 53:50.935
Yeah, that's my lane.
I'll see you in a minute.

54:09.663 --> 54:11.413
Who's that girl?

54:13.375 --> 54:15.417
Just some girl,
a girlfriend I had.

54:15.502 --> 54:17.419
What happened to her?

54:17.504 --> 54:20.214
I don't know.

54:20.298 --> 54:22.967
I'm a free guy.
That's not my style.

54:23.051 --> 54:26.053
I need to be free,
so I let her go.

54:31.768 --> 54:34.019
Can I get a little room here?

54:34.104 --> 54:36.480
Why don't you go
sit over there?

54:36.564 --> 54:38.565
I need a little privacy.

54:50.412 --> 54:52.204
Hey, Sonny?

54:52.289 --> 54:54.164
Where's my ball?

54:54.249 --> 54:56.458
I got it right here.

54:56.501 --> 54:59.044
- Let me see that.
- It's all polished up.

54:59.129 --> 55:02.089
It looks good.
You did a good job.

55:02.173 --> 55:04.800
- I'm going to go bowl.
- Have a good time.

55:04.884 --> 55:06.635
Thanks a lot.

55:06.678 --> 55:09.596
- You're my friend, right?
- You bet.

55:09.681 --> 55:11.640
Thanks, Sonny.

56:40.730 --> 56:43.565
The kid is hot.
You see the pro?

56:57.664 --> 56:58.914
Yes !

57:08.550 --> 57:10.926
Oh ! Oh ! Oh!

57:15.306 --> 57:17.099
( laughs )

57:17.142 --> 57:18.100
Oh! Oh !

57:23.898 --> 57:26.775
You saw it, you saw it.
That's right, Billy's back.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.368
Come on!

57:39.831 --> 57:42.082
Come on! Fuck.

57:42.167 --> 57:45.586
Sonny, can you fix it?

57:45.670 --> 57:50.132
- I'll get it.
- Shit, I was in a groove.

57:53.219 --> 57:56.388
Get out of my chair.
Scoot over.

57:56.473 --> 57:57.806
Damn !

57:58.975 --> 58:00.392
Shit.

58:08.193 --> 58:09.485
Yes !

1:00:14.152 --> 1:00:15.485
Fuck!

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:18.447
What's so funny?
Why don't you try one?

1:00:18.531 --> 1:00:20.657
Go ahead, try one,
big shot.

1:00:25.663 --> 1:00:26.913
Fuck!

1:00:34.005 --> 1:00:36.089
Come on, superstar.

1:00:45.016 --> 1:00:46.433
Figures.

1:00:48.770 --> 1:00:50.687
Can I bowl another one?

1:00:53.316 --> 1:00:55.108
Go ahead.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:57.027
I'm going
to the bathroom.

1:01:17.632 --> 1:01:20.384
- What city, please?
- Buffalo.

1:01:20.468 --> 1:01:21.968
Yes. What listing?

1:01:22.053 --> 1:01:25.347
Can I have the number
of Scott Wood's Exotic Dancers.

1:01:25.431 --> 1:01:27.766
How are you spelling that?

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:30.394
I don't know.
Wood's woo--

1:01:43.116 --> 1:01:45.200
( phone rings )

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:53.500
Recording: Hi, you've reached
Scott Wood's Solid Gold.

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:57.003
This is Scott Wood, the guy
Buffalonians love to hate.

1:01:57.088 --> 1:02:00.048
Folks, I'm real sorry about
that field goal I missed.

1:02:00.091 --> 1:02:02.801
But guess what? I got some
beautiful topless dancers

1:02:02.885 --> 1:02:05.846
here at my new nightclub,
Scott Wood's Solid Gold.

1:02:05.930 --> 1:02:08.056
Come on down and check out
these beautiful girls,

1:02:08.099 --> 1:02:10.517
stripping down for you
to next to nothing.

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:14.354
They're gorgeous. Scott Wood's Live
Solid Gold Sexotic Dancers.

1:02:14.439 --> 1:02:17.899
We're at Niagara and Herglenn.
We'll see you here.

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:23.697
I'm going to kill
that fucker.

1:02:24.782 --> 1:02:26.450
I'm going to kill him.

1:02:38.129 --> 1:02:39.921
We have to go.

1:02:39.964 --> 1:02:43.175
I'm having fun.
Can't I bowl one more time?

1:02:43.259 --> 1:02:45.051
If you want to stay, you stay.
I'm leaving.

1:03:11.621 --> 1:03:13.955
Hey, come back here with me.

1:03:13.998 --> 1:03:17.083
- Where are we going?
- I want to take some pictures.

1:03:17.168 --> 1:03:19.461
Really? You want to take
pictures with me?

1:03:19.504 --> 1:03:21.004
Yeah, really.

1:03:21.088 --> 1:03:22.798
Wait, I've got
to fix my hair.

1:03:22.882 --> 1:03:25.050
Don't fix your hair.
This is not that kind of shit.

1:03:25.134 --> 1:03:28.804
Don't start that shit.
We're just taking simple pictures.

1:03:28.846 --> 1:03:31.181
This is not glamour.

1:03:31.265 --> 1:03:33.642
You look fine.
Come on, you look fine.

1:03:36.187 --> 1:03:40.065
- Is my hair okay?
- Yeah, it looks nice.

1:03:40.149 --> 1:03:42.150
- Are you sure?
- Mm-mm.

1:03:42.235 --> 1:03:44.110
It looks fine.

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:50.826
Put this in.

1:03:50.910 --> 1:03:52.911
( machine whirs )

1:03:54.705 --> 1:03:57.582
Okay be ready, 'cause it's
going to come soon.

1:03:57.667 --> 1:03:59.209
You ready?

1:04:12.390 --> 1:04:14.182
Come on, what is that?

1:04:14.225 --> 1:04:15.725
- What?
- What are you doing?

1:04:15.810 --> 1:04:18.186
You just made me waste $2.
Get up.

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:20.522
- Come on.
- I was making it fun.

1:04:21.607 --> 1:04:24.985
You're missing the point.
You just wasted $2.

1:04:25.069 --> 1:04:27.904
Get up, get up, get up.

1:04:27.989 --> 1:04:30.365
Now listen to me.

1:04:30.449 --> 1:04:31.992
Sit down.

1:04:32.076 --> 1:04:34.411
We're taking pictures
for my parents.

1:04:34.495 --> 1:04:35.871
Do you understand that?

1:04:35.913 --> 1:04:38.415
We're taking pictures
like we're a couple,

1:04:38.457 --> 1:04:42.711
like we like each other,
like we're husband and wife

1:04:42.753 --> 1:04:44.713
and we span time together.

1:04:44.755 --> 1:04:47.048
We span time together
as a couple.

1:04:47.091 --> 1:04:49.759
'Cause we're a loving couple,
spanning time.

1:04:49.844 --> 1:04:53.013
These photos are us
in love, spanning time.

1:04:53.097 --> 1:04:55.557
No bullshit faces,
no funny faces.

1:04:55.641 --> 1:04:57.559
Just look like you like me.

1:04:57.643 --> 1:04:59.769
That's all I want.
Just look like you like me.

1:04:59.854 --> 1:05:03.023
- That's it. Can you do that?
- You're so weird.

1:05:05.026 --> 1:05:06.985
Fine. Let's go.

1:05:08.070 --> 1:05:11.156
Are you going to do it
or are you not going to do it?

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:13.283
I'll do my best.

1:05:13.367 --> 1:05:16.453
I don't want to waste
more money. Just do it right.

1:05:16.537 --> 1:05:18.496
We're in love.
We're spanning time.

1:05:18.581 --> 1:05:20.832
Look like you like me,
look like we're husband and wife.

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:22.959
- I do like you.
- You know what I mean.

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:25.378
I mean like, you like me
like you're my wife.

1:05:25.463 --> 1:05:27.380
Like you're in love.
That kind of like.

1:05:27.465 --> 1:05:30.425
Like we're in love,
spanning time.

1:05:30.468 --> 1:05:33.261
- Just do it right, all right?
- I'll do my best.

1:05:33.304 --> 1:05:35.639
Don't do your best,
do it right.

1:05:35.723 --> 1:05:37.599
And don't get smart.

1:05:37.642 --> 1:05:39.768
I don't want to waste $2.
Just do it right.

1:05:39.852 --> 1:05:41.102
- All right.
- All right.

1:05:41.187 --> 1:05:43.563
Look like you love me.
Let's span time.

1:05:43.648 --> 1:05:45.607
Let's span time together.

1:06:01.499 --> 1:06:04.376
- What are you doing?
- What?

1:06:04.460 --> 1:06:06.920
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.

1:06:07.004 --> 1:06:09.798
What do you mean? We're supposed
to be husband and wife.

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:12.467
- I'm trying to make it look good.
- We're a couple that doesn't touch.

1:06:12.551 --> 1:06:14.761
We like each other.
We like each other a lot.

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:18.264
And we span time together.
We just don't touch each other.

1:06:18.349 --> 1:06:19.599
Now let's span time.

1:06:19.684 --> 1:06:21.851
Let's use a different
color in the back.

1:06:21.936 --> 1:06:24.312
Let's do blue.
This is the blue period.

1:06:24.355 --> 1:06:26.189
Get up, get up.

1:06:26.273 --> 1:06:27.607
Don't touch me again.

1:06:27.692 --> 1:06:30.318
Just look like you like me,
and let's span time.

1:06:30.361 --> 1:06:32.654
All right?
You got that?

1:06:32.738 --> 1:06:34.280
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

1:06:34.365 --> 1:06:37.409
I don't want to waste any more
money. This is my last $2.

1:06:37.493 --> 1:06:38.785
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:40.870
If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.

1:06:40.955 --> 1:06:42.038
No, I'll do it.

1:06:42.123 --> 1:06:43.832
Let's look like
we like each other,

1:06:43.916 --> 1:06:46.376
and span time,
and do not touch me.

1:06:46.460 --> 1:06:48.211
Do not touch me.

1:06:48.295 --> 1:06:50.505
Do not kiss me.

1:06:55.636 --> 1:06:57.345
All right, come on.

1:07:08.733 --> 1:07:11.192
All right, good. Let's see
how they are. Come on.

1:07:15.823 --> 1:07:17.866
Please don't forget
to send the photographs

1:07:17.950 --> 1:07:19.534
and the cards
to my parents.

1:07:19.618 --> 1:07:22.162
I promise I won't forget.
You can trust me.

1:07:22.246 --> 1:07:24.039
One every Christmas.

1:07:33.090 --> 1:07:34.966
So I'll see you around.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:38.178
Where are you going now?

1:08:00.993 --> 1:08:03.119
( phone rings )

1:08:04.497 --> 1:08:06.247
- Is Scott Wood in?
- Woman: No.

1:08:06.332 --> 1:08:08.792
Scott's not in. He doesn't
come in till later.

1:08:08.876 --> 1:08:11.878
- Who's calling?
- Just a friend.

1:08:12.963 --> 1:08:16.007
- What time does he get in?
- He doesn't come in until late,

1:08:16.092 --> 1:08:18.885
- not before 2:00am.
- What time is it now?

1:08:18.928 --> 1:08:21.513
- 8:15.
- He doesn't come in sooner?

1:08:21.597 --> 1:08:25.433
He never comes in before 2:00-2:30
and he stays till closing.

1:08:25.518 --> 1:08:28.603
If you want to see him,
come in after 2:00.

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:45.453
All right, we'll go, okay?

1:08:47.373 --> 1:08:50.125
Why don't we just go some place,
the two of us?

1:08:50.167 --> 1:08:52.460
We'll get a room and
we'll just lay down together,

1:08:52.503 --> 1:08:55.296
we'll lay in a bed.
You want to go some place with me?

1:08:55.381 --> 1:08:58.133
- I do.
- I've got to get a hot bath.

1:08:58.217 --> 1:09:00.343
I really need
to take a hot bath.

1:09:01.762 --> 1:09:05.014
Do you think we could stop and
get a hot chocolate on the way?

1:09:10.062 --> 1:09:12.272
I was only kidding...

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:15.567
when I said I wanted
to lay down with you.

1:09:15.651 --> 1:09:18.611
So don't get your hopes up.

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:24.868
That's too bad, 'cause I was serious
when I said I wanted to.

1:09:49.101 --> 1:09:51.561
Do you prefer smoking
or non-smoking?

1:09:51.645 --> 1:09:53.771
- Whatever.
- Right this way.

1:10:10.748 --> 1:10:13.249
Your waitress will be
with you in a moment.

1:10:16.962 --> 1:10:19.339
- What can I get you?
- Can I have a hot chocolate?

1:10:19.423 --> 1:10:20.632
Very hot.

1:10:20.716 --> 1:10:22.383
- And you, sir?
- Just a glass of water.

1:10:22.468 --> 1:10:23.593
Okay.

1:10:58.921 --> 1:11:03.258
Hey!

1:11:03.342 --> 1:11:06.636
Weren't you in
my third-grade class?

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.179
Yes.

1:11:09.848 --> 1:11:13.309
You remember me?
Wendy Balsam?

1:11:14.395 --> 1:11:16.604
I'm Wendy Balsam, too.

1:11:17.940 --> 1:11:19.399
Oh yeah?

1:11:20.693 --> 1:11:23.027
What happened to you?

1:11:23.112 --> 1:11:24.862
Didn't you get in trouble?

1:11:24.947 --> 1:11:27.073
Didn't you go to jail
or something?

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:28.616
Yeah, but he was innocent.

1:11:28.659 --> 1:11:31.536
We were in
the third grade together.

1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:34.622
I think we were in class
together every year.

1:11:34.707 --> 1:11:37.000
Did you have Mrs. Dannon?

1:11:37.084 --> 1:11:38.793
Yes, I did.

1:11:40.337 --> 1:11:41.671
Yeah.

1:11:41.755 --> 1:11:43.631
Did you live on my block?

1:11:43.674 --> 1:11:47.176
Because I used to see you walk
by my house every day.

1:11:47.261 --> 1:11:49.846
I had a friend
who lived over there.

1:11:49.930 --> 1:11:50.888
Oh yeah.

1:11:50.973 --> 1:11:53.099
It's strange, 'cause every time
I'd look out my window,

1:11:53.142 --> 1:11:55.435
I'd see you walking by.

1:12:03.027 --> 1:12:04.694
This is Don.

1:12:06.405 --> 1:12:08.573
And...
what's your name again?

1:12:08.657 --> 1:12:11.326
- Billy Brown.
- Billy Brown.

1:12:11.368 --> 1:12:13.453
Yeah, that's it.

1:12:13.537 --> 1:12:16.706
This is Don Shanks,
my fiancé.

1:12:16.790 --> 1:12:19.751
How you doing, Billy?
It's nice to meet you.

1:12:21.045 --> 1:12:23.296
Since you guys were
in school together,

1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:26.299
you want to come over and sit
down here for a little bit maybe?

1:12:31.055 --> 1:12:33.181
Billy:
We're getting ready to leave.

1:12:33.223 --> 1:12:35.058
Thanks a lot,
maybe another time.

1:12:35.142 --> 1:12:36.893
Sure, yeah.

1:12:38.187 --> 1:12:40.563
It was nice
meeting you... again.

1:12:43.067 --> 1:12:45.401
That girl has
the same name as me.

1:12:45.486 --> 1:12:49.238
And she looks an awful lot like
that photograph in your locker.

1:12:49.323 --> 1:12:51.366
The hot chocolate's going
to be a couple of minutes.

1:12:51.450 --> 1:12:53.076
Billy: We're going.
Thank you, anyway.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:55.036
- Layla: What do you mean?
- Sure.

1:12:55.079 --> 1:12:58.039
You want to stay,
you stay. I'm going.

1:12:58.082 --> 1:13:01.167
Look at that girl,
look at her.

1:13:01.210 --> 1:13:03.544
She's so creepy.

1:13:03.629 --> 1:13:07.215
She is so creepy,
and you are so nice.

1:13:07.299 --> 1:13:10.718
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I just think...

1:13:10.761 --> 1:13:13.388
you are much
too good for her.

1:13:15.099 --> 1:13:17.266
Don't give me no fucking
bullshit, all right?

1:13:17.351 --> 1:13:18.726
Don't give me no bullshit.

1:13:18.811 --> 1:13:22.814
I don't need your pity,
she's-too-good-for-me crap.

1:13:23.899 --> 1:13:25.358
So we're going to leave

1:13:25.442 --> 1:13:29.404
because you ran into someone
you had a crush on in middle school?

1:13:29.488 --> 1:13:31.906
I'm gonna kill Scott Wood.
I'm just gonna kill him.

1:13:31.990 --> 1:13:34.784
- What are you saying?
- I'll kill the motherfucker.

1:13:34.868 --> 1:13:37.662
- I'm going to kill him.
- Billy.

1:13:37.746 --> 1:13:40.164
What are you saying?

1:13:40.249 --> 1:13:42.417
I'm going, okay?

1:13:42.501 --> 1:13:44.544
Let me tell you something.

1:13:44.628 --> 1:13:49.173
I don't care about you
or your fucking hot chocolate.

1:13:49.258 --> 1:13:51.467
I don't need anybody.

1:13:51.552 --> 1:13:54.053
Did you hear what I said?

1:13:54.138 --> 1:13:56.180
Did you hear what I said
this time?

1:13:56.265 --> 1:13:57.598
Do you want
to know the truth?

1:13:57.683 --> 1:14:00.059
I could have had any girl
I wanted in school.

1:14:00.144 --> 1:14:01.477
Any girl I wanted.

1:14:01.562 --> 1:14:04.397
Do you know why I didn't
have a girlfriend?

1:14:04.481 --> 1:14:07.191
Because there was nobody
that I liked.

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:09.694
Nobody that I liked.
That's the truth.

1:14:09.778 --> 1:14:11.696
I could've had anybody.

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:14.615
There was nobody that I liked,
because girls stink.

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:15.783
They stink.

1:14:15.868 --> 1:14:18.911
They're evil,
and they're all bad,

1:14:18.996 --> 1:14:20.580
all of them.

1:14:20.664 --> 1:14:22.874
They're backstabbers...

1:14:22.958 --> 1:14:24.459
like you.

1:14:27.629 --> 1:14:31.466
- So let's go, all right?
- I'm not going.

1:14:31.508 --> 1:14:33.801
- You want to stay?
- Yes.

1:14:35.179 --> 1:14:37.013
You stay, all right?
Fuck you.

1:14:37.097 --> 1:14:39.599
- Fuck you, too.
- Yeah, fuck you.

1:15:07.336 --> 1:15:09.295
Can I use the bathroom?

1:15:09.379 --> 1:15:12.173
Someone stole the key.
Use the one at Denny's.

1:15:53.423 --> 1:15:55.550
( sputtering )

1:16:04.017 --> 1:16:05.393
I can't--

1:16:10.274 --> 1:16:16.862
I don't want to live.

1:16:16.947 --> 1:16:18.489
Don't want to live.

1:16:45.726 --> 1:16:47.643
Hey.

1:16:50.397 --> 1:16:52.106
I'm sorry.

1:16:54.526 --> 1:16:56.611
Can we just go out of here?

1:16:58.697 --> 1:17:01.157
What about the hot chocolate?

1:17:02.242 --> 1:17:04.327
I really want you
to come with me.

1:17:04.411 --> 1:17:06.662
I want to get away
from that witch over there.

1:17:06.747 --> 1:17:08.372
( Layla sniffles )

1:17:09.833 --> 1:17:11.417
Okay.

1:17:13.170 --> 1:17:14.629
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:17:36.693 --> 1:17:39.070
So you want to go get
a room now?

1:17:39.154 --> 1:17:41.322
You can take a bath,
you'll feel better.

1:17:51.124 --> 1:17:52.833
Okay, we got time.

1:18:20.862 --> 1:18:22.405
( rings bell )

1:18:24.157 --> 1:18:25.991
We need a room for one night.

1:18:26.076 --> 1:18:27.952
- How many nights?
- One night.

1:18:29.913 --> 1:18:31.706
Here, fill this out.

1:18:33.917 --> 1:18:38.170
Rooms are $29.99 plus tax.
Comes to $34.50.

1:18:38.255 --> 1:18:41.674
I need a license
and cash or a credit card.

1:18:43.427 --> 1:18:45.720
What really happened
with you and Wendy Balsam?

1:18:45.804 --> 1:18:48.556
You've been so quiet all night.

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:51.892
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I'm not jealous.

1:18:51.935 --> 1:18:53.894
I just wondered...

1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:57.773
I told you I don't want
to talk about it.

1:19:00.986 --> 1:19:03.612
Checkout time is at 11:00am and
there's no smoking in the room.

1:19:26.845 --> 1:19:29.054
( runs water )

1:19:48.325 --> 1:19:50.201
Don't sit on this bedspread,

1:19:50.285 --> 1:19:53.162
it's disgusting.
Let's take this off.

1:19:58.335 --> 1:20:00.085
These are dirty.

1:20:28.949 --> 1:20:30.449
Billy: I'm cold.

1:20:45.632 --> 1:20:48.133
You never went out
with Wendy Balsam, did you?

1:20:52.138 --> 1:20:54.014
I told you I did.

1:21:08.530 --> 1:21:11.407
I knew her since I was
in kindergarten.

1:21:14.411 --> 1:21:16.704
She was in my class.

1:21:18.874 --> 1:21:20.207
I remember...

1:21:21.293 --> 1:21:23.711
I hated school so much.

1:21:25.088 --> 1:21:27.089
I just--

1:21:27.173 --> 1:21:29.633
I didn't like to wake up.

1:21:32.429 --> 1:21:34.555
The first day
I went to school...

1:21:37.100 --> 1:21:39.894
I just remember I was
crying and screaming.

1:21:39.978 --> 1:21:41.645
My mother...

1:21:41.730 --> 1:21:43.772
she had to drag me there.

1:21:46.192 --> 1:21:48.986
And then when I got
into class...

1:21:49.070 --> 1:21:51.238
that's when I saw her.

1:21:55.994 --> 1:21:57.912
And I remember just...

1:22:00.248 --> 1:22:03.250
staring at her and I
started thinking things.

1:22:04.711 --> 1:22:08.714
I was very young, but I was
imagining kissing her

1:22:08.798 --> 1:22:10.716
and marrying her.

1:22:14.346 --> 1:22:16.597
I just thought about her
every day,

1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:18.766
all the time.

1:22:18.850 --> 1:22:21.435
And then school time
would go by fast.

1:22:24.022 --> 1:22:26.231
And sometimes I would
see her in church.

1:22:26.316 --> 1:22:29.485
And I hated church, too.

1:22:29.569 --> 1:22:31.820
And if I saw her in church...

1:22:33.365 --> 1:22:35.240
it was good because then...

1:22:35.325 --> 1:22:37.409
time went by really fast.

1:22:39.412 --> 1:22:41.789
Did she know
that you liked her?

1:22:47.671 --> 1:22:49.046
No.

1:22:50.757 --> 1:22:52.466
She would just--

1:22:54.928 --> 1:22:58.555
she would just tell me to stop
staring at her all the time...

1:22:59.724 --> 1:23:01.850
mocking me out.

1:23:01.935 --> 1:23:04.645
"Take a picture,
why don't you?"

1:23:08.525 --> 1:23:11.485
Did you ever have
any other girlfriends?

1:23:18.034 --> 1:23:19.743
No.

1:23:19.828 --> 1:23:21.662
Just her.

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:37.428
- ( water runs)
- I'm gonna fill up the whole tub.

1:23:38.888 --> 1:23:40.514
My father used to make us
fill up the tub

1:23:40.598 --> 1:23:43.017
with just, like,
an inch of hot water.

1:23:43.101 --> 1:23:45.352
That's all
we were allowed to use.

1:23:45.395 --> 1:23:47.229
He was so cheap.

1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:25.267
Billy? Are you
in the tub yet?

1:24:25.351 --> 1:24:26.769
Why?

1:24:26.853 --> 1:24:29.730
Can I come and sit
in there with you?

1:24:29.814 --> 1:24:31.982
I don't want to be
out here alone.

1:24:32.067 --> 1:24:33.400
I'm cold.

1:24:33.485 --> 1:24:35.861
I'm in the tub, all right?

1:24:35.904 --> 1:24:38.155
I don't want anybody
coming in here.

1:24:38.239 --> 1:24:41.533
I just want to sit
in the bathroom with you.

1:24:41.618 --> 1:24:44.369
I don't want to be out here.
I'm cold.

1:24:44.454 --> 1:24:46.413
I don't want to be here.

1:24:46.498 --> 1:24:49.458
No, you can't.
I'm in the tub.

1:24:49.542 --> 1:24:51.418
I won't look.

1:24:51.503 --> 1:24:54.671
Please just let me come in
and talk to you.

1:24:59.594 --> 1:25:01.136
Hold on.

1:25:06.476 --> 1:25:08.936
You can come in,
but don't look at me.

1:25:09.020 --> 1:25:12.231
If you look at me one time,
I'll throw you out of the room.

1:25:12.315 --> 1:25:14.316
All right, I promise
I won't look.

1:25:26.287 --> 1:25:27.830
Don't look.

1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:36.338
You look like a little boy
in the bathtub.

1:25:36.422 --> 1:25:38.632
- What did I just tell you?
- I'm not looking,

1:25:38.716 --> 1:25:40.467
I'm just imagining.

1:25:41.678 --> 1:25:44.429
- Just don't look.
- I'm not.

1:25:48.685 --> 1:25:51.687
Billy, I'm freezing.
Can I get in the tub with you?

1:25:51.771 --> 1:25:54.940
No, I just--
you see how you start?

1:25:54.983 --> 1:25:57.901
Didn't you say you just want
to come and sit in here?

1:25:57.986 --> 1:26:00.112
I want to be
in the tub alone.

1:26:00.196 --> 1:26:01.989
Turn your head away,
don't look at me.

1:26:02.073 --> 1:26:04.408
But I'm freezing, Billy.

1:26:04.492 --> 1:26:06.285
I'm sorry.

1:26:10.540 --> 1:26:11.915
Why?

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.917
Because I want to be
in here alone.

1:26:14.002 --> 1:26:16.044
I don't take baths
with people.

1:26:29.142 --> 1:26:31.185
Can we get out of the bathtub?

1:26:32.770 --> 1:26:34.354
You want to?

1:26:36.774 --> 1:26:38.483
Can you go first?

1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:42.029
Okay.

1:31:06.002 --> 1:31:07.836
Layla:
Where are you going?

1:31:12.300 --> 1:31:14.468
I'm just gonna go get
a cup of coffee.

1:31:14.510 --> 1:31:15.677
You want something?

1:31:17.513 --> 1:31:19.014
Yeah.

1:31:19.056 --> 1:31:20.974
Can I have a hot chocolate?

1:31:21.017 --> 1:31:22.893
Okay, I'll get it.

1:31:24.270 --> 1:31:26.229
When are you coming back?

1:31:28.357 --> 1:31:30.484
Five minutes.
What do you mean?

1:31:30.526 --> 1:31:32.569
I'm coming right back.

1:31:34.155 --> 1:31:36.573
I just have this feeling
you're not gonna come back.

1:31:43.164 --> 1:31:47.209
I just told you I'm coming back.
I'll be back in five minutes.

1:31:48.294 --> 1:31:50.795
I'll get you
a hot chocolate.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:53.173
I really like you.

1:31:53.216 --> 1:31:56.092
I'm gonna be really sad
if you don't come back,

1:31:56.177 --> 1:31:57.844
unless you tell me.

1:31:57.929 --> 1:32:00.180
If you're not going
to come back, just tell me,

1:32:00.223 --> 1:32:02.390
don't lie to me.

1:32:02.475 --> 1:32:05.477
Are you going
to come back or not?

1:32:05.561 --> 1:32:08.021
If you don't want me to go,
I won't go.

1:32:08.064 --> 1:32:12.609
- I won't get a hot chocolate.
- If you want coffee, go get coffee.

1:32:12.693 --> 1:32:16.988
- Just come back.
- I told you I'm coming back.

1:32:23.079 --> 1:32:26.122
- Can I get a kiss goodbye?
- No.

1:32:27.416 --> 1:32:29.543
Don't--

1:32:29.627 --> 1:32:32.254
don't start trouble,

1:32:32.338 --> 1:32:35.298
don't start evil.

1:32:35.383 --> 1:32:37.050
I didn't say
I'd give you a kiss.

1:32:37.134 --> 1:32:38.927
I said I'd get you
a hot chocolate.

1:32:40.263 --> 1:32:41.763
So I'm going to go.

1:32:42.848 --> 1:32:44.599
Can I have a hug?

1:32:46.852 --> 1:32:48.645
Oh man.

1:32:53.401 --> 1:32:55.360
Let me just shake hands.

1:33:34.317 --> 1:33:37.110
Remember you promised
you'd come back.

1:33:40.781 --> 1:33:43.325
- I promise.
- Billy...

1:33:43.409 --> 1:33:46.119
I just want you
to know...

1:33:47.163 --> 1:33:49.039
I think...

1:33:49.123 --> 1:33:51.625
you're the sweetest
guy in the world.

1:33:53.544 --> 1:33:55.545
And the most handsome.

1:34:06.015 --> 1:34:07.766
And I love you.

1:35:35.104 --> 1:35:37.063
( phone rings )

1:35:48.284 --> 1:35:50.410
Billy:
Goon, it's me.

1:35:51.495 --> 1:35:53.538
I just called to tell you
that I was sorry

1:35:53.622 --> 1:35:56.207
- for yelling at you before.
- Yeah?

1:35:56.292 --> 1:35:59.252
Well, you're always
yelling at me.

1:36:00.755 --> 1:36:03.089
I wanted to tell you
I'm sorry...

1:36:04.925 --> 1:36:08.762
and to say thank you
for sending me the raisins.

1:36:08.846 --> 1:36:11.264
Goon:
I sent you raisins, Billy.

1:36:11.348 --> 1:36:14.559
I found a little box for them,
and I sent them to you.

1:36:14.602 --> 1:36:16.770
You're not...

1:36:16.854 --> 1:36:18.271
very nice to me.

1:36:18.355 --> 1:36:20.690
I don't know if I want to be
friends with you

1:36:20.775 --> 1:36:24.360
- if you're going to yell at me.
- I understand, Goon.

1:36:24.445 --> 1:36:28.239
Please, I asked you already,
don't call me Goon.

1:36:28.324 --> 1:36:30.116
I asked you
not to call me Goon.

1:36:30.159 --> 1:36:33.787
- My name is Rocky.
- I meant to say Rocky.

1:36:33.829 --> 1:36:35.830
I was going
to call you Rocky, okay?

1:36:37.041 --> 1:36:38.792
I called because I want

1:36:38.834 --> 1:36:40.835
to give you the combination...

1:36:40.878 --> 1:36:44.005
to my locker
at the bowling alley.

1:36:45.341 --> 1:36:47.383
You want to give me
the combination?

1:36:47.468 --> 1:36:51.262
- Why, Billy?
- You know my good luck pen?

1:36:51.347 --> 1:36:54.140
I want you to have
my good luck pen.

1:36:55.226 --> 1:36:57.310
I left it in there for you.

1:36:58.604 --> 1:37:01.189
You can have my bowling ball.

1:37:01.273 --> 1:37:03.399
You can have all my things.

1:37:03.484 --> 1:37:05.443
I don't want your things.

1:37:05.528 --> 1:37:07.320
I don't want your things.
Those are your things.

1:37:07.404 --> 1:37:11.491
- Why're you giving away your stuff?
- I want you to--

1:37:11.575 --> 1:37:13.284
you're my best friend.

1:37:15.204 --> 1:37:18.248
I'm really sorry that I always
yell at you and stuff.

1:37:19.416 --> 1:37:21.251
'Cause you've...

1:37:22.586 --> 1:37:25.004
been a good friend to me.

1:37:25.047 --> 1:37:27.382
You sent me those raisins.

1:37:27.466 --> 1:37:30.009
Goon: Are you going
to do bad things?

1:37:30.094 --> 1:37:32.095
Is that why you're
giving me your stuff?

1:37:32.179 --> 1:37:34.055
No.
( sniffles )

1:37:35.182 --> 1:37:37.559
I was kidding
about Scott Wood.

1:37:38.727 --> 1:37:41.354
I don't really care
about that anymore.

1:37:43.065 --> 1:37:44.858
I've got a big job.

1:37:44.900 --> 1:37:46.359
I really have...

1:37:48.153 --> 1:37:51.072
to work for a long time.
I'll be away.

1:37:52.616 --> 1:37:55.702
I want to give you
the combination, okay?

1:37:55.786 --> 1:37:56.911
32...

1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:00.039
17...

1:38:00.124 --> 1:38:02.000
21 .

1:38:05.129 --> 1:38:08.673
- You're my best friend, okay?
- Billy. Please--

1:41:35.255 --> 1:41:36.672
Jan:
Run, run, run!

1:41:36.757 --> 1:41:40.218
Tackle him, tackle him,
tackle him !

1:41:41.637 --> 1:41:43.596
Oh no!

1:41:45.140 --> 1:41:47.850
Jan.

1:41:47.935 --> 1:41:50.019
Jan, it's 2:00,
you know?

1:41:50.104 --> 1:41:52.605
It's 2:00. I'm getting
the shakes out here,

1:41:52.689 --> 1:41:55.233
and I'm starving.
Can we get something to eat?

1:41:56.318 --> 1:41:58.444
- All right, honey.
- You hungry?

1:41:58.487 --> 1:42:00.446
- Yeah.
- So am I.

1:43:30.037 --> 1:43:32.288
Hey. Forget it.

1:43:32.372 --> 1:43:34.790
Did you hear what I said?
Forget it.

1:43:34.875 --> 1:43:36.876
You cannot have anything
in my locker.

1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:39.295
I take it all back.
I took everything back.

1:43:39.379 --> 1:43:43.591
You heard me, I'm taking it back.
So stay away from my locker.

1:43:43.675 --> 1:43:45.801
And if I find out
you go near my locker,

1:43:45.886 --> 1:43:48.346
I'll give you a karate chop
right in the head.

1:43:49.806 --> 1:43:52.683
Guess what?
Guess what happened today?

1:43:52.768 --> 1:43:55.061
I got a girl.

1:43:55.145 --> 1:43:58.147
I got a girl.
There's a girl who loves me.

1:43:58.232 --> 1:44:00.566
And she's very pretty,
and she's very nice,

1:44:00.651 --> 1:44:03.361
and she loves me.
So what do you think of that?

1:44:03.445 --> 1:44:06.864
So stay away from my locker,
I take all my things back.

1:44:06.949 --> 1:44:09.367
I saw Wood today.

1:44:09.451 --> 1:44:12.203
I'm at the strip joint.

1:44:12.287 --> 1:44:14.580
This place is crazy.

1:44:14.665 --> 1:44:17.458
He seems like
a nice guy, too.

1:44:17.542 --> 1:44:20.044
He really is just like...

1:44:20.087 --> 1:44:22.755
a normal guy.

1:44:22.798 --> 1:44:25.925
Remember,
we used to like Wood.

1:44:25.968 --> 1:44:29.220
He kicked good that season.
He was good that whole season.

1:44:29.304 --> 1:44:31.430
He kicked good all year.

1:44:31.515 --> 1:44:33.599
He missed one measly
field goal,

1:44:33.684 --> 1:44:35.935
and everybody's
against him.

1:44:35.978 --> 1:44:38.646
Who told me to bet on Buffalo?
Buffalo stunk all year.

1:44:38.730 --> 1:44:40.648
They gave the Giants that game.

1:44:40.732 --> 1:44:42.608
If it wasn't for Wood,
they would've lost

1:44:42.651 --> 1:44:44.485
three or four
other games that year.

1:44:45.570 --> 1:44:47.363
What?

1:44:47.447 --> 1:44:49.824
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm here.

1:44:49.908 --> 1:44:51.284
No.

1:44:51.368 --> 1:44:53.744
Anyway, listen,
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

1:44:53.829 --> 1:44:56.956
I've got to go.
My girlfriend's waiting for me.

1:45:19.771 --> 1:45:22.273
- How you doing?
- Okay.

1:45:22.357 --> 1:45:25.151
- You have hot chocolate, right?
- We sure do.

1:45:25.235 --> 1:45:27.194
- Is it hot?
- It's hot.

1:45:27.279 --> 1:45:30.156
Give me a hot chocolate to go,
a large one.

1:45:30.198 --> 1:45:32.825
Okay, hot chocolate
to go-- large.

1:45:32.868 --> 1:45:36.203
- Make it good, a good one.
- It'll be good.

1:45:41.084 --> 1:45:43.419
Let me have one of these--

1:45:43.503 --> 1:45:45.338
let me have
a heart cookie, too.

1:45:45.380 --> 1:45:46.964
That's nice.

1:45:47.049 --> 1:45:48.799
How much are
the heart cookies?

1:45:48.884 --> 1:45:51.635
Heart cookies?
95 cents.

1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:53.346
- 95?
- Right.

1:45:53.430 --> 1:45:56.223
- You got a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

1:45:56.308 --> 1:45:58.434
I'm going to buy
one for him.

1:45:58.518 --> 1:46:01.312
For your girlfriend.
Don't chomp on it yourself.

1:46:01.396 --> 1:46:03.147
Save it for her.

1:46:03.190 --> 1:46:04.899
Clerk: He's got
a heart cookie coming.

1:46:04.983 --> 1:46:06.942
- Billy: Who made those?
- We make them right here.

1:46:07.027 --> 1:46:08.861
That's very nice--
a heart cookie.

1:46:08.904 --> 1:46:11.113
- Who thought of the heart?
- I don't know.

1:46:11.198 --> 1:46:13.866
Somebody who was romantic.

1:46:15.327 --> 1:46:18.371
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Okay, let's see...

1:46:20.207 --> 1:46:22.958
Go easy. Easy, easy, easy...

1:46:25.379 --> 1:46:27.338
Four bucks on the nose.

1:46:27.422 --> 1:46:29.298
- Four bucks.
- Four bucks.

1:46:29.383 --> 1:46:31.342
- Four bucks.
- That's right,

1:46:31.426 --> 1:46:34.512
- including his.
- Yeah, right.

1:46:34.596 --> 1:46:36.639
Four...

1:46:36.723 --> 1:46:39.809
and here,
this is for you, because--

1:46:39.893 --> 1:46:42.228
I don't know why,
just take it.

1:46:42.270 --> 1:46:43.938
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot.

1:46:44.022 --> 1:46:46.232
I'll see you guys later.
You got your cookie here.

1:46:46.316 --> 1:46:48.859
Before you leave,
take it for your girlfriend.

1:46:48.944 --> 1:46:50.986
- All right, thanks.
- Bye-bye.
