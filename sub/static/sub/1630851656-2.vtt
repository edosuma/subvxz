I am not going to apologize
for speaking the truth.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.919
This town is on
the wrong path.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.759
If we keep worrying about
trigger warnings

39:46.885 --> 39:49.725
and micro aggressions
and safe spaces

39:49.846 --> 39:50.966
how are we supposed to tackle
real problems

39:51.097 --> 39:53.017
like unemployment
and drug abuse, huh?

39:53.141 --> 39:56.271
We can’t just hug
those things away.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.437
What the heck is going on?

39:59.564 --> 40:01.614
Pops is pushing all her buttons
and she’s falling for it.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.783
We have to get him
outta here.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.611
I know, Trey.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.606
Listen, I appreciate
your passion,

40:06.738 --> 40:07.908
I know you care
about this town,

40:09.157 --> 40:10.567
but the way you go about
fixing things is wrong.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.410
It’s hateful, it’s dangerous,
and I won’t stand for it.

40:13.536 --> 40:14.576
Well, you’re gonna have to,
Pops,

40:14.704 --> 40:17.294
because the polls have me
up by five.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.745
Well, now, here is the thing
about that.

40:19.876 --> 40:22.626
You are gonna drop out
of the race.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.304
[laughs]

40:24.422 --> 40:26.132
What have you been smoking,
old man?

40:26.257 --> 40:27.627
That’s never gonna happen.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.429
I think it is.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.428
[whispering]

40:39.562 --> 40:43.322
You have until 4:30 to concede
the race or I go public.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.898
Trey, Nicole.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.949
You folks have yourselves
a wonderful day.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.041
‐Paula?
‐What’d he say?

40:57.163 --> 40:58.753
What does Pops know?

41:00.750 --> 41:02.170
Where did you put the body?

41:02.293 --> 41:04.673
Relax, it’s safe.
He’s in the TV room.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.931
Holy shit! Holy shit!
Holy shit!

41:14.055 --> 41:16.065
Holy shit! Holy shit!

41:27.402 --> 41:28.992
Operator: 911 what
is your emergency?

41:29.112 --> 41:31.912
Yeah, I need to report a...
what the hell do I call this?

41:32.031 --> 41:33.411
Zombie apocalypse?

41:33.533 --> 41:34.743
I am not saying
zombie apocalypse,

41:34.867 --> 41:35.867
they’ll hang up on me.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.544
Hello? Hello?

41:38.663 --> 41:39.873
Assholes!

41:44.460 --> 41:45.880
[groans]

41:48.089 --> 41:48.879
It’s fine.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.047
It’s gonna be fine.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.085
I know.

41:53.553 --> 41:53.593
’Cause if you were gonna turn
into one of those things

41:54.929 --> 41:57.389
you probably would have started
to by now, right?

41:57.640 --> 41:58.600
Ok.

42:00.184 --> 42:05.064
If you do start to turn,
what do you want me to do?

42:07.025 --> 42:09.745
Hey! Hey!

42:09.861 --> 42:10.741
Hey!
