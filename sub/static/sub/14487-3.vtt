as long as I've got
this catheter in me.

21:27.502 --> 21:29.635
Won't you join us,
Mr. Blob?

21:29.766 --> 21:31.376
Sounds like a plan.

21:32.421 --> 21:35.163
This is what makes life
worth clinging to--

21:35.294 --> 21:38.513
three fathers enjoying
a day out with their sons.

21:38.644 --> 21:39.558
[ bottles clink]

21:39.689 --> 21:41.734
It would seem
we've taught our boys

21:41.865 --> 21:43.039
a lesson about life.

21:43.171 --> 21:47.044
Man or blob,
it's what's inside that counts.

21:48.654 --> 21:50.352
[ muffled shouts]
