00:02.127 --> 00:06.088
And then,
l think l'm going to go
to the garlic festival.

00:06.214 --> 00:08.257
Wow.
Sounds like fun.
You guys would love it.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.092
No, we wouldn't.
They have a TCBY booth.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.011
Cool.
Same stuff
you get downtown.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.679
Do you like TCBY?
Who doesn't?

00:13.763 --> 00:18.976
"l can't believe
it's yogurt."
lt'll be fun.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.354
l confirmed with Raskin Design
and they're expecting the both
of you in an hour.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.106
Oh, actually,
it's just going
to be me.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.816
They said
the both of you.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.026
That's a mistake.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.236
You should give them
a call, check that out.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.697
All right,
just clear this up.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.033
Well, there's actually been
a few changes in the company,

00:34.117 --> 00:36.535
and Michael and l
are actually
at the same level.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.912
So, l can. . . No.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.707
No, why would
that be a problem?

00:41.791 --> 00:43.542
Jim's a good kid,
he can handle a lot,

00:43.626 --> 00:47.504
but sometimes you
have to call in a master.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.634
Why would you date
an amateur when you
could date a professional?

00:53.136 --> 00:55.220
Great. See you then.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.680
What?

00:56.765 --> 00:59.767
They said that they
would feel more comfortable
if you came along.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.769
Why don't they
just want you
to go by yourself?

01:01.853 --> 01:04.271
Why do they want
me to come, too?
l don't understand.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.315
l absolutely don't
understand, either.

01:06.399 --> 01:10.319
l don't want you to feel
like l'm babysitting you
or something.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.696
All right.
All right.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.365
Let me go get
your stroller.
(CHUCKLES)

01:16.201 --> 01:18.535
JlM: Sure.
Michael's a good teacher.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.454
A teacher
is someone
who stands

01:20.538 --> 01:21.955
right next to you
your whole life

01:22.040 --> 01:23.916
and never lets
you do anything.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.876
That's what
a teacher is, right?

01:32.842 --> 01:34.218

going to call him?

No. What is
his name?

01:50.318 --> 01:52.361
Mr. Borchard.
They're very formal.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.821
Yeah. l've spoken
to them on the phone.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.365
Yeah, well,
this is not the phone.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.827
This is real life, baby,
and you got to own it.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.286
ls that what
you are wearing?

02:01.371 --> 02:02.371
Yes, it is.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.457
And that is
the watch that you
are going to wear?

02:05.542 --> 02:08.627
No, it is not.
You should
wear this watch.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.920
l will loan it to you.

02:10.004 --> 02:12.506
lt is a Tankard.
l highly recommend
you wear that.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.508
No, thanks.
They are into style.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.592
Mmm-hmm.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.636
They are into appearance.
We are selling success.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.305
And paper.
That's sort of secondary.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.516
Nope. No.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.686
He's trying to
micro co-manage me.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.982

going to resolve
the melody,

Oh, well, Jim and l
got caught in a little

03:23.703 --> 03:26.872

flash lightning.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.582
Wow. Sounds scary.

03:28.666 --> 03:32.169
lt was. lt was.
And then in an instant,
it wasn't.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.712
Why isn't Jim wet?

03:33.796 --> 03:34.880
l outran it.

l don't think it rained.
My hip would be throbbing.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.843
lt rained.
Michael, can l get
you something?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.053
A towel, some cocoa?

03:41.137 --> 03:42.888
Nothing. Cocoa.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.015
l'll just leave
that suit in your
office, then?

03:45.099 --> 03:47.059
Good, yeah.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.353
Must be nice
to have company
on these cold calls.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.939
We're kind of
a dynamic duo.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.273

Definitely not.
No, we just
work together.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.041
Looks like somebody's got
a case of the definitelys.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.923
Michael, the custodian
from Raskin Design

found your keys

what's going on?

Hey, Michael, did you
fall into a koi pond?

04:35.191 --> 04:38.527
l can't really hear you.
I think we have sort
of a bad connection.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.238
Jim, did Michael
fall into a koi pond?

04:43.032 --> 04:46.034
lt's like Michael said.
lt was something else.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.246
Okay, this is what it was.
lt was these bunch of idiots

that had put a fish tank
in the ground with
no cover and no railing.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.960
So you fell in?
No.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.462

to save a child
that had fallen in.

had fallen in?

l'm not going to bump.

lt was very, very terrifying.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.935
Truthfully, it wasn't
the way he fell in.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.522
lt was how long it
took him to get out.

like a really nice deal.

that since we are

have a special
on envelopes. . .

Pam's carrying
our surrogate

needed to keep her figure
for Fashion Week.

our baby in Pam.

what Pam looks like.

together made you
burst out laughing

into an Adam Sandler

to make that sale.

listen to them.

(WHlSPERlNG) Michael?
Yes.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.373
A carp is both a fish
and a term for complaining.

They're mocking you
with word play.

did you find Nemo?

the butt of the joke.

into that pond.

to put on my suit,

be too short,
and he'd look. . .

07:34.537 --> 07:36.496
Damn it,
he'd still look good.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.208
The most fundamental thing
about sensitivity training

07:40.293 --> 07:44.880
is that you cannot
make fun of a person for
something or some action

07:44.964 --> 07:47.382
that they have done
that they regret.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.552
You can only make fun
of things that they
have control over.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.848
Like, Oscar is gay.
That is his choice.

07:54.932 --> 07:59.352
We can make fun of that.
l did not choose
to fall into a koi pond.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.521
Michael, you still
can't make fun of people

08:01.606 --> 08:04.316
for race or gender
or sexual orientation
or religion. . .

08:04.400 --> 08:06.693

into the room?

this right now.

to sensitivity training

fun of us every day.

tell the difference
between you guys saying,

08:40.436 --> 08:42.020
"Stop, because
l want you to stop,"

08:42.104 --> 08:46.024
or stop as in,
"Stop, you're making

might be out of bounds,
we put on this list.

to put on the list, right?

into the fountain

to stop it.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.411
Thank you, eject it.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.288
Jim, you let
Michael fall in.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.498
DWlGHT: Play it again.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.626
(ALL EXCLAlM)

18:48.710 --> 18:51.712
DWlGHT: He purposefully
leaned away and let you fall.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.006
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Oh, man !

18:57.010 --> 19:00.304
l think when l started
to see you go in,
l think l just froze.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.348
l don't think
you froze.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.103
lt's a killer
new dance move.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.523
(SOFTLY) Do you
want to talk
in your office?

19:10.607 --> 19:11.649
No.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.736
l didn't ask you.
Would you like to talk?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.699
(WHlSPERS) Judas.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.492
Jim is my enemy,
but it turns out

19:21.577 --> 19:23.661
that Jim is also
his own worst enemy.

19:23.745 --> 19:28.416
And the enemy of my enemy
is my friend, so Jim
is actually my friend.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.171
But, because he is
his own worst enemy,

19:33.255 --> 19:35.047
the enemy of my
friend is my enemy,

19:35.132 --> 19:37.258
so actually
Jim is my enemy.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.093
But. . .

19:39.511 --> 19:42.263
l should have
grabbed you. l'm sorry.

19:43.348 --> 19:47.143
Look, l thought l could
have done today's
sales call alone.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.729
l mean,
l may never be as good
a salesman as you are,

19:49.813 --> 19:52.815
but l at least need
the chance to do the job.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.194
Jim is jealous of me?

19:59.531 --> 20:01.324
Jim is jealous of me.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.038
Hey, what's up,
lifeguard?

20:07.122 --> 20:09.081
OSCAR: Jim, l think
l'm in your way.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.167
(BOTH CHUCKLlNG)

20:16.006 --> 20:17.632
Oscar's a douche.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.594
He's all right.
No.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.971
He's. . . Yeah,
he's all right.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.808
Okay.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.689
Thanks, Michael.
You're welcome.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.234
Whoa! Almost fell.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.652
(CHUCKLES)

20:42.658 --> 20:45.618
Hey, Erin, do you mind
faxing this for me?
Oh, sure.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.411
Wait, hand them
to me upside down,

20:47.496 --> 20:49.956
so l don't
accidentally
read them.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.791
Okay.
Thanks.

20:51.875 --> 20:52.917
Mmm-hmm.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.628
How did today go, by the way?
Did you make any sales?

20:55.712 --> 20:58.130
No, it was a total
waste of time.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.385
lt was fun, though,

21:02.469 --> 21:04.011
because l got
to spend the day

21:04.096 --> 21:06.347
with Andy Bernard
and he's really cool.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.141
Yeah, he is.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.394
He's like the coolest
person l've ever met.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.354
That's right.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.399
He's like Marlon Brando.

21:19.152 --> 21:22.530
Oh, do you mean
Marlon Wayans?
'Cause he is.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.783
l actually do mean
Marlon Wayans. Yeah.
