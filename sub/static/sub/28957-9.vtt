00:02.036 --> 00:04.905
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Snowfall.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.309
NIX:
Holy shit.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.144
ANDRE:
Here we are, killing ourselves

00:10.178 --> 00:11.179
to keep these drugs away,

00:11.212 --> 00:12.813
and our government
is just bringing them in.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.983
-So what are you thinking?
-Burn the whole
fucking thing down.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.486
Why the fuck is the DEA
coming after me?!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.521
My name isn't Reed Thompson,
it's Teddy McDonald,

00:20.554 --> 00:22.290
and I'm an officer with the CIA.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.657
You got to get the fuck out of
that house and don't even stop

00:23.691 --> 00:24.925
to pack your bags.
You got it?

00:24.958 --> 00:26.727
-(speaking Hebrew)
-(gunshot)

00:28.696 --> 00:30.198
TEDDY:
You blew up my whole operation.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.501
You outed every last one
of my assets. Have you lost

00:33.534 --> 00:36.137
-your fucking mind?!
-I could ask you the same thing.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.038
Bringing cocaine into the U.S.?

00:38.072 --> 00:40.374
Exposing yourself,
the Agency, me?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.009
LOUIE:
You don't keep drugs
at your place.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.577
You know he ain't got
the badge and the gun.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.913
FRANKLIN:
Something else is missing.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.015
File detailing all my business
with Reed Thompson.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.883
Forget you ever saw
any of this shit, Andre.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.654
I put in 18 years out of my 20,
and I'm not gonna let you

00:53.687 --> 00:56.824
destroy this community.
Here's your file.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.192
Now get the fuck
out of my house.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.737
*

01:26.454 --> 01:28.456
*

01:49.943 --> 01:51.945
*

02:19.139 --> 02:21.575
*

02:33.454 --> 02:35.088
FRANKLIN:
What time was I here?

02:35.122 --> 02:36.590
Dinnertime, around 7:00.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.926
We had frozen pizza.
Celentano's.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.362
-Pepperoni. I kind of burnt it.
-And then?

02:41.395 --> 02:43.697
We watched TV.
St. Elsewhere. A rerun.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.833
It was about a rapist
in the hospital.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.668
-And you fell asleep
on the sofa.
-Okay, good.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.503
Good, and-and what time
was that?

02:49.537 --> 02:51.305
It was 11:30 or so.
You slept here all night.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.007
Woke up around 8:00
'cause of the garbage trucks.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.143
What garbage trucks?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.646
There were garbage trucks
this morning.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.015
Yeah. Right. Good. Good.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.785
Y-You're not gonna give me
any idea what this is about?

03:04.818 --> 03:07.321
The less you know, the better.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.857
Make sure you get rid of that.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.365
JEROME:
What we doing here, nephew?

03:18.932 --> 03:20.801
(water stops)

03:29.510 --> 03:31.211
Aw...

03:34.315 --> 03:38.419
Andre, uh, sh-shot hisself dead
last night.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.855
-What?
-Fuck you talking about?

03:41.889 --> 03:43.291
How you know that?

03:45.158 --> 03:47.828
Moms called.
Cops are everywhere.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.163
I was in the Valley at Rob's.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.300
But you know how it is.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.102
Cops gonna be asking questions,

03:55.135 --> 03:57.538
coming up
with their own answers.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.673
So I think it's best
if we all lay low for a while.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.910
-Lay low where?
-Rob's.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.079
-Shit...
-He's got plenty room,
it's far away from here.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.381
Cops want to come at us,

04:07.415 --> 04:08.882
it ain't gonna matter
where we at.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.384
FRANKLIN:
Ain't no reason
to make it easy for them.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.354
Prentice and his people,
they're ready and waiting,

04:13.387 --> 04:14.722
in case y'all get picked up.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.925
What if picking us up
ain't what they got in mind?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.874
(dog barking)

04:33.907 --> 04:35.609
(keys jangling)

04:35.643 --> 04:39.279
(indistinct conversations)

05:02.503 --> 05:04.872
What happened, Officer?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.275
Franklin?

05:10.611 --> 05:12.580
Franklin!

05:12.613 --> 05:14.948
Mama's calling.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.291
(indistinct radio chatter)

05:33.701 --> 05:35.703
*

06:01.395 --> 06:02.396
Lior, watch the door.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.445
I love what you've done
with the place.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.684
Wouldn't it just be easier
to close the blinds?

06:26.019 --> 06:27.788
You know enough to warn me,

06:27.821 --> 06:29.890
but not enough to stop my men
from dying.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.759
I'm truly sorry about Yuda.
I am.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.761
Someone in your camp outed me.

06:38.165 --> 06:42.235
But what matters is, we weren't
the ones who pulled the trigger.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.372
What matters is my man is dead.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.740
And you still won't give me

06:46.774 --> 06:49.677
any straight fucking answer
as to why.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.712
You have enemies.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.015
People want you dead.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.550
I just need to know
who they are

06:56.584 --> 06:58.586
and I'll get the target
off your back.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.388
The timing.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.224
The sniper.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.060
It's Mossad.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.230
Your own country's after you?
Why?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.732
(Avi exhales)

07:13.300 --> 07:16.069
A few years ago,
I acquired some timing circuits

07:16.103 --> 07:18.438
on the black market
from a Viet Cong general.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.677
I turned around and sold it,
not realizing

07:23.711 --> 07:26.346
they were only
intermediary buyers.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.448
And who did they sell them to?

07:28.482 --> 07:32.085
The Islamic
Revolutionary Guards.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.421
They used them in IEDs.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.857
-Against Israel.
-Mm.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.260
(exhales)

07:42.129 --> 07:44.632
I tried to make amends.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.800
Paid off officials,
blackmailers on top of that.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.270
I thought I was over
with this shit!

07:50.303 --> 07:52.740
Somebody made a stronger
argument to retarget you.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.875
Who?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.877
Who did this?

08:01.381 --> 08:03.083
They're being taken care of.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.757
I am going to fix this.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.459
I just need a couple days.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.836
FRANKLIN:
Mel found him?

08:22.870 --> 08:26.506
CISSY:
Mm-hmm. And she all tore up.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.610
ALTON:
Yeah, and uh, this
Detective Aviles was over here

08:29.643 --> 08:31.278
wondering where you were
last night.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.847
I-I told you.
I-I was at Rob's.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.651
-At his daddy's house?
-Nah.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.687
He got his own place now.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.091
Hey, I was thinking...

08:44.124 --> 08:46.026
two of you should stay
at one our new apartments.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.828
Just for a few days.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.230
ALTON:
Mm-hmm.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.533
No. Why?
We're not leaving.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.402
We didn't do anything wrong.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.638
No one said you did.
I just--

08:57.671 --> 09:01.208
I think it'd be smart.
Right?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.177
ALTON:
Well, don't worry about us, son.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.480
Me and your mama know how
to weather this kind of storm.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.482
-Good.
-Yeah.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.485
I'm gonna take off.
You all right?

09:13.587 --> 09:14.855
Are you?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.890
Yeah.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.163
*

09:30.037 --> 09:31.739
Cops eat a bullet
more than most.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.741
Yeah, but he didn't seem
like the type.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.343
That hooker thing
must've messed with him.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.378
He said it wasn't a hooker.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.249
And don't forget,
his kid's a basehead.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.517
That would send anyone
down a hole.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.986
Not to mention 'Nam.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.388
Now, hold on.
A lot of us served.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.058
I know I'm not
thinking about that shit.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.660
He talked a lot
about that Saint kid.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.427
The next-door neighbor.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.496
You hear they're doing, like,
a million a week on the street?

09:56.529 --> 09:59.667
-A million a week? That kid?
-That's what I'm hearing.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.935
Motherfucker...

10:01.969 --> 10:05.038
All I know,
if that M.E. report comes back

10:05.072 --> 10:07.274
with anything suspicious...

10:07.307 --> 10:09.843
we're gonna start
taking shit apart.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.079
(crowd murmuring)

10:12.112 --> 10:14.748
BARTENDER:
Everyone hold on a minute.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.784
(murmuring continues)

10:19.052 --> 10:21.054
(tires screeching)

10:48.415 --> 10:51.318
Rigo Vasco,
meet Stephen Havemeyer.

10:51.351 --> 10:55.255
Mr. Havemeyer handles special
compartmentalized issues

10:55.288 --> 10:58.225
for the director of the CIA,

10:58.258 --> 11:00.593
and he'll be able to facilitate
any requests you might have

11:00.627 --> 11:02.095
while you're working
with the Agency.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.098
Really? (chuckles)

11:05.132 --> 11:09.269
Um... I-I don't know, maybe...

11:11.805 --> 11:13.673
I would love
a diplomatic passport.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.777
TEDDY:
Of course. You got it.
We'll take care of it.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.246
Thank you for being
so accommodating, Rigo.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.882
I can tell this is gonna be
a very fruitful partnership.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.317
Okay, thanks.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.020
I look forward to talking more.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.499
Hey, Stephen.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.835
Come to our club sometime.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.873
-(chuckles)
-(engine starts)

11:55.248 --> 11:57.684
What the fuck are you doing?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.686
I'm salvaging this operation.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.889
-"Salvaging"?
-You got played.

12:01.922 --> 12:06.059
Julia did not come here to take
the operation away from me.

12:06.093 --> 12:09.696
She came here to blow it up.

12:09.729 --> 12:14.902
And I can tell from the look on
your face that you had no idea.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.904
So I'm gonna make this
extremely simple for you.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.671
At this point,
you have two options.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.673
The first one is
you call the director yourself

12:20.707 --> 12:23.276
and let him know how you allowed
one of your own agents

12:23.310 --> 12:25.846
to destroy this operation
and stop the flow of

12:25.879 --> 12:28.916
tens of millions of dollars
to the war effort.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.519
Or?

12:32.552 --> 12:36.423
You trust that I know
what the fuck I'm doing

12:36.456 --> 12:38.959
and you use your considerable
influence to fix

12:38.992 --> 12:40.760
what you unwittingly
allowed Julia

12:40.794 --> 12:42.863
to fuck up in the first place.

12:42.896 --> 12:46.066
Start by contacting Mossad;
set up a meeting.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
What do you need from Mossad?

12:48.135 --> 12:50.103
I don't have time
to explain this to you.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.139
People are dying.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.043
Which call are you gonna make?

12:56.076 --> 12:58.078
(Havemeyer exhales)

13:02.182 --> 13:04.184
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
In a statement today,
SoCal Edison

13:04.217 --> 13:06.419
said that due to
record high temperatures

13:06.453 --> 13:08.155
in the ongoing heat wave,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.789
the blackouts
are likely to continue

13:09.823 --> 13:11.391
over the next few days.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.461
In tragic local news,
LAPD Sergeant Andre Wright

13:14.494 --> 13:16.463
was found dead
in his home last night

13:16.496 --> 13:18.131
in South Central Los Angeles.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.567
The circumstances
of his death are unknown.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.135
An LAPD spokesperson said

13:22.169 --> 13:23.736
-it's department policy...
-Oh, my God.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.538
...not to comment on
ongoing investigations.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.774
We will continue to follow
this story as details...

13:34.247 --> 13:38.785
-Where's Melody?
-Um...

13:38.818 --> 13:41.521
she's still sleeping, Mama.
You know she needs the rest.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.923
No, what she needs is to eat

13:42.956 --> 13:44.424
and to be with people
that love her.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.359
-Mel? Honey?
-Mom. Mama, no.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.766
Oh, my God.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.737
-You're not high, are you?
-No, Mama.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.472
I just, I just didn't want
her to leave.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.443
Mel? I don't want you
in this house.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.478
-EVA: Mama, no.
-I cannot have

14:05.512 --> 14:08.648
that poison in my house.
I can't risk everything.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.318
-You understand what I'm saying?
-EVA: We can't just

14:11.351 --> 14:13.786
-throw her out.
-That's all we can do, baby.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.322
That drug is a sickness

14:15.355 --> 14:17.991
that gets into everybody near.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.096
Get out of my house.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.132
(snickers)

14:25.165 --> 14:27.167
(giggling softly)

14:29.002 --> 14:30.971
-Get out!
-I'm going.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.973
-It's okay, Ms. Walker.
-Don't touch me.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.674
-Mel, Mel, no, just stay.
-I'll see you later.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.143
-Yeah, it's okay, I'll see you.
-Mel.
-No.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.147
MEL (softly):
Hold up.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.548
(clatter)

14:41.581 --> 14:44.417
Oops. (laughing): I'm sorry.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.553
(Karina sniffles)

14:46.586 --> 14:48.555
(birds singing, dog barking)

14:48.588 --> 14:50.557
(baby crying)

14:50.590 --> 14:52.825
*

15:10.843 --> 15:12.012
(engine shuts off)

15:12.045 --> 15:14.047
(dog barking)

15:20.920 --> 15:23.190
Thought it was just you and me.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.558
Anything you got to say to me
you can say in front of Lee.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.631
Fine.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.567
Li'l Lee here
been fucking with my crew.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.569
Trying to take our territory.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.471
Yeah, I ain't tried,
I took that shit.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.274
Let the man talk.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.877
I feel like we need
to renegotiate terms.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.479
Okay.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.581
Ten a key from now on.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.217
(sniffles) Either that

15:50.250 --> 15:53.086
or this little motherfucker
head is my football.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.789
That's my terms.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.825
(kids chatting in distance)

16:00.760 --> 16:03.596
The prices
are gonna stay the same.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.598
You don't like it,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.767
by all means,
find yourself a new plug.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.404
And Leon here...

16:11.438 --> 16:13.106
well, he family.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.078
Fuck with him, you fuck with me.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.746
Understand?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.918
Shit ain't right.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.555
It ain't.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.190
But that's the way it is.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.228
(sirens wail in distance)

16:36.796 --> 16:38.465
Come on.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.007
All right, nigga.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.393
Hey, thanks for having my back
with that motherfucker.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.495
You know he want
to take over and shit.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.663
-Park the car.
-What?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.699
Park the car.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.139
(brake clicks, engine shuts off)

17:22.209 --> 17:25.011
You know I got all this shit...

17:25.044 --> 17:27.647
hanging over my head.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.250
But you off trying to start
a war with our partners?

17:30.283 --> 17:32.419
The nigga dis me
every time I see him.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.354
Acting like he the one
in charge and shit.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.556
In Compton, he is the one.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.991
You lose...

17:39.025 --> 17:40.660
every time you bite
with that nigga

17:40.693 --> 17:42.662
and I'm the one
that pays for it.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.398
Now, you're gonna
get off his corners,

17:45.432 --> 17:47.534
you're gonna
leave his people be,

17:47.567 --> 17:50.170
or you the one that's gonna
find yourself a new plug.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.005
-You don't mean that shit.
-The fuck I don't.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.308
I built this shit.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.544
Me. Brick by brick.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.746
And I'll be damned
if I let you tear it down

17:59.779 --> 18:03.383
just 'cause you don't like
the way another nigga talk.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.688
(exhales sharply)

18:10.657 --> 18:12.525
Drive, motherfucker!

18:12.559 --> 18:13.893
(Jerome scoffs)

18:13.926 --> 18:15.362
How this nigga living?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.932
Your boy Rob doing good.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.601
(Louie chuckles)

18:21.634 --> 18:23.670
And so are we.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.373
Maybe it's time
we got a bigger place.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.040
Not up here.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.909
Hell no. (chuckles)

18:29.942 --> 18:31.478
(music playing faintly)

18:35.915 --> 18:38.451
You knew...

18:38.485 --> 18:40.553
that shit was gonna
end up like this.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.393
You blame me?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.060
For taking Franklin
and that brick

18:48.094 --> 18:50.830
up to Claudia's that night?

18:58.305 --> 19:01.040
If I ain't want
to be in this game,

19:01.073 --> 19:03.576
I wouldn't be.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.245
And neither would you.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.949
All that matter right now
is that we survive.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.718
That's it.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.753
(song continues playing)

19:17.624 --> 19:19.626
That's it.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.620
(sniffles)

20:02.068 --> 20:04.070
(exhales)

20:08.675 --> 20:10.643
(exhales sharply)

20:10.677 --> 20:12.679
(breathing heavily)

20:15.382 --> 20:17.384
(sniffles)

20:28.661 --> 20:30.563
(panting)

20:43.276 --> 20:44.911
(doorbell rings)

20:44.944 --> 20:48.548
(electronic toys
beeping, buzzing)

20:48.581 --> 20:50.583
I'll get it.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.022
Who are you?

20:56.055 --> 20:59.859
Melody. Well, honey, come on in.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.928
THEO:
Um...

21:01.961 --> 21:04.230
U-Uh, Herb, you have a visitor.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.265
(TV playing indistinctly)

21:11.738 --> 21:14.541
Kids, let's all go play
in the living room, okay?

21:14.574 --> 21:16.008
-All right.
-Let's go.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.310
Good to see you, Melody.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.180
Hey, Mel.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.549
What are you doing here?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.617
Did you always have two?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.853
Uh, no. (chuckles)

21:26.886 --> 21:29.121
No, we adopted
Anthony last year.

21:30.490 --> 21:34.026
-How are you holding up?
-(scoffs)

21:34.060 --> 21:36.095
What can I do, Mel?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.997
Tell me what you need.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.603
Franklin killed my daddy.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.475
Franklin killed my daddy.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.946
(ice cream truck jingle playing)

21:58.685 --> 22:01.153
(construction equipment roaring)

22:05.792 --> 22:07.394
(lawnmower rumbling)

22:09.328 --> 22:11.130
(sounds overlapping)

22:11.163 --> 22:13.165
-(child crying)
-ICE CREAM MAN: I got two more!

22:15.001 --> 22:18.671
(ice cream truck melody
overlapping hip-hop song)

22:18.705 --> 22:20.940
*

22:20.973 --> 22:23.643
(children shouting)

22:23.676 --> 22:27.346
(girl crying)

22:27.380 --> 22:29.115
* See, I got something new,
better for you *

22:29.148 --> 22:31.451
* Now, if you're not too skinny,
if you're not too fat *

22:31.484 --> 22:34.353
-* Everybody say,
"How about that?" *
-* How about that? *

22:34.387 --> 22:36.055
(crying)

22:36.088 --> 22:37.957
-* Oh, and-and do
what you like *
-(horn honking)

22:37.990 --> 22:39.325
* Hey, you ladies,
what's happening? *

22:46.533 --> 22:50.169
-(knocking on door)
-BERNICE: It's open.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.542
(dog barking in distance

23:01.848 --> 23:04.884
Hi, Bernice.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.286
I'm Cissy.
We-we live next door.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.856
Oh, yeah. Aren't you sweet?
Come on in.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.326
You can put that on a magazine
on the table.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.629
-Oh, sure.
-And have a seat.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.197
I don't want
to put you out none.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.331
Don't be silly.

23:19.365 --> 23:22.502
I could use some mature company.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.371
How's she doing?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.710
I had to nail her window shut.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.312
We've already had
half a dozen squabbles

23:33.345 --> 23:35.748
that almost came to blows.

23:35.782 --> 23:39.085
Between the-the grief
and the drugs,

23:39.118 --> 23:42.421
it's a wonder she don't explode.

23:42.455 --> 23:45.057
I am so sorry.

23:49.762 --> 23:54.266
I intend to get this house
in shape and sell it,

23:54.300 --> 23:57.269
and then move Mel down
to Tyler...

23:57.303 --> 23:59.371
till her heart and body
can heal.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.942
Of course. Is there anything
I can do to help?

24:02.975 --> 24:04.944
Between the cleaning,
and watching that wild girl

24:04.977 --> 24:06.445
and grieving,

24:06.479 --> 24:09.048
I can't hardly think
about the funeral.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.517
We could host the repast.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.486
Oh, that would be
a godsend. Thank you.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.522
Of course. And...

24:15.555 --> 24:19.091
you're selling this house, huh?

24:19.125 --> 24:22.028
I have a small
real estate business.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.796
Maybe I could help you
with that.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.532
I think the repast
will be enough.

24:25.565 --> 24:29.802
Oh, of course. Sure.

24:29.836 --> 24:33.072
Andre told me everything.

24:33.105 --> 24:37.076
You're a good woman,
but your son...

24:37.109 --> 24:40.112
His money and all
his businesses,

24:40.146 --> 24:42.114
even in real estate,

24:42.148 --> 24:43.516
that's the devil's wages,

24:43.550 --> 24:45.685
and I will not have nothing
to do with that.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.357
(Latin pop music playing)

25:04.704 --> 25:07.473
I was starting to think
you weren't gonna show.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.508
(sighs, clears throat)

25:11.778 --> 25:14.513
You all right?

25:14.547 --> 25:16.515
We doing this again?

25:16.549 --> 25:18.350
Doing what?

25:18.384 --> 25:20.352
You calling me in here.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.855
Find out if my mess is gonna
end up in your lap.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.625
Is it?

25:25.658 --> 25:27.860
You don't need to worry, okay?

25:27.894 --> 25:29.696
I did what needed to be done.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.331
I've always done exactly
what needed to be done.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.067
To keep you protected and happy,
keep the product moving,

25:35.101 --> 25:37.403
make the money, everything!

25:40.072 --> 25:41.473
(sighs)

25:41.507 --> 25:43.009
(quietly):
Everything.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.344
I understand what
you're going though.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.979
(scoffs)

25:48.848 --> 25:50.583
You understand exactly zero

25:50.617 --> 25:52.752
of what the fuck
I'm going through, Reed.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.592
You got blood on your hands.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.831
You have innocent blood
on your hands, even.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.499
You're responsible for the lives

26:07.533 --> 26:10.236
of everybody you love,

26:10.269 --> 26:13.539
and you're worried all the time.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.241
And you're afraid.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.543
"What if I made
a grave miscalculation?"

26:17.576 --> 26:20.546
And inside of all that,
you're completely,

26:20.579 --> 26:24.050
utterly alone.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.925
When does it end, Reed?

26:34.694 --> 26:37.563
I don't know.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.767
But...

26:40.800 --> 26:42.802
until then...

26:45.171 --> 26:47.974
...I'll be right here with you.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.979
(door squeaks open)

26:58.117 --> 27:00.119
(door slams shut)

27:02.388 --> 27:05.624
JULES:
There are things
I wanted to say.

27:05.658 --> 27:10.262
Um, because I'm guessing that
after I leave,

27:10.296 --> 27:12.732
unless it's about Paul,
you and I won't--

27:12.765 --> 27:14.767
won't be speaking for a while.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.606
I wanted you to know
how sorry I am.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.410
Not for what I did, but that
I had to hurt you to do it.

27:26.679 --> 27:29.581
I don't know how else to try
to make you understand

27:29.615 --> 27:31.751
how scared I am for you,

27:31.784 --> 27:34.286
except to say that

27:34.320 --> 27:37.924
choosing between losing you...

27:37.957 --> 27:40.827
and seeing you destroyed,
I did the only thing

27:40.860 --> 27:43.529
that I felt I could live with.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.168
I know you can't
believe me right now,

27:49.201 --> 27:52.905
but everything I said...

27:54.841 --> 27:58.845
...everything I felt was true.

28:06.552 --> 28:10.222
It's not too late, Teddy.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.792
We could still have a life.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.529
Please come with me.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.438
You should leave your keys
on the table before you go.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.257
(pager beeping)

28:54.133 --> 28:55.701
(line ringing)

28:55.734 --> 28:59.405
Returning a page.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.707
Yeah, I can be there in-in 30.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.617
(sighs)

29:22.761 --> 29:24.463
(coughs, sniffs deeply)

29:24.496 --> 29:26.532
*

29:37.476 --> 29:38.978
(siren whoops once)

29:51.257 --> 29:53.259
*

30:18.684 --> 30:20.186
Keep your hands on the wheel.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.661
You arresting me?

30:33.132 --> 30:36.468
Andre Wright was my friend.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.140
But more than that,
he was my partner.

30:43.609 --> 30:46.045
Do you understand
what that means?

30:47.914 --> 30:50.182
I've got an idea.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.021
I was with him hours before.

30:55.054 --> 30:59.191
That was not a man
contemplating suicide.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.793
But what I couldn't figure out

31:01.827 --> 31:04.296
is how somebody made it look
so convincing.

31:04.330 --> 31:09.135
How he would let anybody
get that close.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.170
You knew him for
a long time, right?

31:13.305 --> 31:16.008
-Since I was a child.
-So I bet

31:16.042 --> 31:18.110
he let you get real close.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.579
(cocks pistol)

31:25.084 --> 31:26.818
Like this.

31:37.930 --> 31:41.333
Andre thought he could
stop the rain from coming.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.372
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
with a man like that.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.813
If you're gonna kill me...

31:56.915 --> 31:58.951
...get on with it.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.755
If you want a bullet,

32:03.789 --> 32:06.892
I'd be more than happy
to give it to you.

32:10.062 --> 32:13.032
-But if you want to live...
-(uncocks pistol)

32:17.003 --> 32:19.638
...maybe you and I can
work something out.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.744
(chuckles)

32:29.948 --> 32:31.783
The almighty dollar.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.453
Yeah.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.388
So long as you got
enough of 'em.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.957
I've got plenty.

32:38.991 --> 32:43.629
And you'll make sure none of
your buddies go rogue...

32:43.662 --> 32:47.099
decide to come after
me and mine?

32:47.133 --> 32:50.102
You'll be covered.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.770
But get one thing straight.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.605
You work for me.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.907
It's whatever I want
whenever I want it.

32:55.941 --> 32:58.110
You understand?

32:58.144 --> 33:00.412
Yes, Officer.

33:00.446 --> 33:03.249
Don't get smart, Franklin.

33:03.282 --> 33:08.187
Because I promise I'll never
let you get that close.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.259
Drive safe.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.342
(dish scraping)

33:41.019 --> 33:43.855
It's just awful
what happened to Andre.

33:43.889 --> 33:48.327
Last week I saw him
coming home from work, and...

33:48.360 --> 33:50.229
now he's dead.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.498
I never thought he'd be capable
of something like that.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.533
So sad.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.641
You know he did it, right?

34:09.415 --> 34:11.183
Either Franklin killed Andre

34:11.217 --> 34:13.152
-or he had him killed.
-Police ruled it a suicide.

34:13.185 --> 34:16.222
That might be, but you see
the way Franklin's been acting.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.491
The weight he's been carrying...

34:19.525 --> 34:20.626
I don't want to talk about this.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.861
And I don't want to say it,

34:22.894 --> 34:25.164
but if we're gonna continue
to be in his life,

34:25.197 --> 34:27.065
then we got to know
where we're going.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.211
Franklin hasn't spent the night

34:39.245 --> 34:42.214
in the Valley in a long time.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.056
I need to... I...

34:51.089 --> 34:52.891
Wait, wait.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.773
(knocking on door)

35:07.806 --> 35:10.209
BERNICE:
Melody? You asleep?

35:13.044 --> 35:14.913
Officer Nix is here to see you.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.984
Said you'd want to hear him out.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.061
Don't take too long.

35:30.095 --> 35:33.098
-She a mess
and we got to get ready.
-Yes, ma'am.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.935
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me, baby.

35:41.673 --> 35:44.176
The medical examiner's report
came in.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.146
It was a suicide.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.683
That's fucking bullshit
and you know it.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.453
His prints on the gun,

35:54.486 --> 35:56.121
the angle and trajectory
of the shot,

35:56.154 --> 35:59.291
-the weapon that he claimed...
-Franklin Saint murdered my dad.

35:59.325 --> 36:02.294
Franklin killed him!

36:02.328 --> 36:04.830
NIX:
These things happen.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.298
You never know how
someone's gonna react...

36:06.332 --> 36:07.733
-The fuck are you talking about?
-He was suspended,

36:07.766 --> 36:09.100
and you've been
in so much trouble...

36:09.134 --> 36:10.436
Oh, I killed him?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.771
I killed him. Great. I--

36:12.804 --> 36:14.072
You know what? Get the fuck out.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.307
-Get out!
-I'm sorry.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.608
(screaming):
Get out!

36:16.642 --> 36:18.710
-Bab...
-Get out-- Don't touch me!

36:22.481 --> 36:24.483
(seabirds calling)

36:26.452 --> 36:29.020
TEDDY:
We can't use this
as any kind of trampoline.

36:29.054 --> 36:31.490
-It's way too close
to the border.
-I know. I know.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.861
Reed, this is Hernan.

36:35.894 --> 36:38.997
-He's helping me.
-Helping you with what?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.867
I first thought about it
that night in the woods,

36:41.900 --> 36:43.535
digging, you remember?

36:43.569 --> 36:46.805
What can we do to not need
anyone's farm or routes,

36:46.838 --> 36:48.474
-or whatever?
-(clanking)

36:48.507 --> 36:52.344
Not to be worried about
la migra or customs...

36:52.378 --> 36:53.979
So-- What is that sound?

36:54.012 --> 36:56.014
Yeah. Come on in.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.859
Come on in.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.570
TEDDY:
You're digging a tunnel.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.139
Starting to.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.909
(speaks Spanish)

37:23.942 --> 37:26.211
And it's going to go
all the way under the border?

37:26.244 --> 37:29.080
All the way.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.283
We're going slowly
on the other side.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.484
In San Ysidro.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.185
It's a clothing store.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.990
Tunnel should be ready
in less than a month.

37:48.434 --> 37:52.070
So? What do you think?

37:53.572 --> 37:55.407
Do you have beer?

37:55.441 --> 37:57.175
What?

38:12.791 --> 38:14.626
(chuckles)

38:21.232 --> 38:23.234
(jazz music playing)

38:30.709 --> 38:33.579
(indistinct chatter)

38:42.588 --> 38:44.790
Thank you so much
for having us here.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.325
I'm only sorry
we couldn't do more.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.765
I'm sorry, Mel.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.769
I know how it feels.

38:57.803 --> 38:59.405
You do?

38:59.438 --> 39:01.239
Yeah.

39:01.272 --> 39:03.509
My dad died when I was five.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.012
That must have been awful.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.822
(jazz continues playing)

39:24.329 --> 39:26.331
(indistinct chatter)

39:35.541 --> 39:37.976
(group murmuring)

39:49.354 --> 39:51.690
-(screen door slams)
-WOMAN: How you doing?

39:51.723 --> 39:53.725
-Welcome.
-Mm-hmm.

40:08.373 --> 40:09.841
Mel?

40:16.548 --> 40:18.850
Mel, did you...

40:24.690 --> 40:26.357
Oh, Mel, you don't need
that shit.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.300
Baby, please...

40:42.774 --> 40:45.410
(exhales)

40:49.447 --> 40:51.449
Mel...

40:57.188 --> 40:59.024
(quietly):
Oh... fuck...

41:10.035 --> 41:11.202
(groans)

41:11.236 --> 41:13.872
Mel, the fuck you doing?

41:15.607 --> 41:17.408
(groans)

41:23.314 --> 41:24.382
Mel?

41:24.415 --> 41:26.051
Aah!

41:27.853 --> 41:30.989
Mel...
(grunts)

41:36.628 --> 41:38.363
Mel, don't...

41:43.034 --> 41:45.036
(labored breathing)

41:52.110 --> 41:54.479
(shallow breathing)

43:44.622 --> 43:46.291
