WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:02.753
Previously on stargate atlantis.

00:04.838 --> 00:08.675
I believe you refer to our enemy as the replicators.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.639
They have begun to annihilate human worlds.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.642
We need to know if you can shut down the replicator attack code on your own.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.394
I've been looking into that,and it's not very promising.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.105
But with this wraith's help,you think you could do it?

00:23.524 --> 00:24.483
Take this.

00:24.483 --> 00:25.526
What's this?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.861
It's the core drive of the ship's tracking system.

00:28.278 --> 00:34.117
If this works,we should be able to track 
every aurora class replicator ship in the 
galaxy in real time.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.288
My duplicate did say they were building more.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.999
A lot more.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.547
Don't worry,we're ahead of schedule.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.339
I know.

00:47.673 --> 00:50.384
All the settlements we've been assigned have been evacuated.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.513
I know,I know,it's just that most of the planets that are in the replicators' path are people

00:54.513 --> 00:58.934
that we've had almost no contact with,
so I need you and teyla out there as much 
as possible.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.352
Yeah,well,I think it might be the flu.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.145
She's been looking a little green lately.

01:03.689 --> 01:04.982
I'm fine.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.692
Where are we going to now?

01:07.609 --> 01:09.570
M9r-373.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.238
The massanians.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.531
Should be interesting.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.741
Look,I'm sorry we're having to go out so much.

01:14.783 --> 01:19.121
I know you don't feel so hot,but you're the one with all the contacts out there,so.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.122
it's all right.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.290
I'm feeling much better now.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.000
Off world activation!

01:27.629 --> 01:29.506
That must be lieutenant kemp's team.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.093
Receiving video transmission.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.469
Coming in now,colonel.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.853
Lieutenant,looks like things are going well.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.480
Most of the settlement's on their way through,

01:45.480 --> 01:47.733
but a good number of them have decided to stay behind.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.735
I'm not sure they believe us,sir.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.030
I'm requesting teyla come back and try to talk some sense into the stragglers,

01:53.030 --> 01:54.489
because I'm not getting anywhere with them.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.867
Well,I don't think we can do that.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.161
The replicator ship's going to be there within a half hour.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.662
Well,I don't know what to do.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.582
They-- incoming!

02:04.708 --> 02:05.876
It's too late.

02:05.918 --> 02:06.960
They're already here!

02:06.960 --> 02:08.544
Lieutenant,get your team through the gate!

02:08.586 --> 02:09.463
I can'T.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.881
There's too many people--

02:11.798 --> 02:13.300
we lost the transmission.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.426
Dial him back.

02:17.971 --> 02:18.931
I can't get a lock.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.557
They must've taken out the gate.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.518
How many people were left on that settlement?

02:22.518 --> 02:24.478
Just under 2,000.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.764
both ships at the same time.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.807
This is a first.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.475
This is the first time we've needed them.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.230
Well,since I've been here.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.111
Colonel.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.533
Seriously?

04:02.201 --> 04:03.660
Good flight?

04:03.660 --> 04:04.745
Long flight.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.038
We'll make it worth your while.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.080
That's what I hear.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.249
You have a way of tracking the replicator ships?

04:09.291 --> 04:10.125
We do.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.044
That'll make finding and destroying them a lot easier.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.004
Why don't you come into my office? We'll get you briefed.

04:17.423 --> 04:22.846
It is this recent discovery of the essential duality of this particular stem of the nano sub-code

04:22.846 --> 04:26.558
that has opened up a whole world of possibilities when it comes to the expedient

04:26.600 --> 04:29.520
and permanent deactivation of the internanite bonds--

04:29.520 --> 04:30.771
rodney.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.898
I'll let you know when I'll take questions,thank you.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.901
Have you created an anti-replicator weapon or not?

04:35.901 --> 04:39.571
If you just let me continue,I think you'd have a better understanding of the complexity--

04:39.571 --> 04:41.657
yes or no,doctor.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.159
Well,no.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.203
All right,we move on to plan B.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.329
Just like that?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.748
The replicators are destroying every human colony

04:49.748 --> 04:52.459
they can find in an attempt to wipe out the wraith's food supply.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.752
We can't wait.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.087
We have to act now.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.297
Yeah,but plan b,it's not a good plan.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.090
Oh,no?

04:58.131 --> 05:02.594
Sure,the apollo and the daedalus have been retrofitted with the new asgard plasma beam weapons,

05:02.594 --> 05:04.263
which,given,are very,very powerful,

05:04.263 --> 05:05.597
but they still can't destroy the replicators.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.058
We don't have to destroy them,we just destroy their ships.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.184
I mean,from what I understand,

05:09.184 --> 05:11.520
once they're exposed to the harsh environment of space,

05:12.062 --> 05:13.730
they'll essentially be neutralized.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.692
Well,"essentially neutralized" and "neutralized" are two very different things.

05:16.692 --> 05:19.403
Back when we blasted niam into space,he froze solid.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.739
We didn't have a problem till we warmed him up.

05:22.781 --> 05:23.991
That's what I'm saying.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.160
Look,your way leaves replicator cells inactive,

05:27.160 --> 05:29.413
just waiting around for someone to reactivate them.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.747
My way shuts them down for good.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.000
But our way is actually operational.

05:33.542 --> 05:37.212
Come to think of it,what exactly is your way?

05:37.212 --> 05:40.632
From what I understand,you haven't even gotten your programming done yet,

05:40.632 --> 05:42.342
let alone a delivery method.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.844
Well,you didn't let me finish my presentation.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.971
I think I got the gist of it.

05:46.722 --> 05:47.514
Really?

05:47.514 --> 05:48.265
Rodney.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.977
no,no,I'm just wondering when the colonel here became a math and physics expert.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.022
Doctor,you came into this meeting knowing that you had nothing,

05:55.272 --> 05:57.274
but instead of just saying that like a man,

05:57.274 --> 06:01.695
you thought that you'd dazzle us with a lot of fancy talk and think that we were too dumb to notice.

06:01.737 --> 06:02.946
So,now you're questioning my manhood?

06:02.946 --> 06:03.864
All right,that is enough.

06:03.906 --> 06:07.701
- No,he just told-  
- rodney,move on.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.372
Look,I think we've got this tracking system down.

06:12.414 --> 06:16.210
We can peg where they're going to be within a 30-minute window,and given current data,

06:16.210 --> 06:18.420
we've got at least 12 hours before any of their ships

06:18.462 --> 06:20.047
are even close to an inhabited planet.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.426
Give me and the wraith,like,10 hours to get the shut-down program working.

06:24.468 --> 06:28.805
If I don't,then you can feel free to go ahead and open up on them with your beam weapons.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.099
All right.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.768
You have 10 hours.

06:32.768 --> 06:33.977
Go.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.771
All right.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.442
I don't understand how you guys put up with--

06:40.442 --> 06:43.278
if you ever talk like that to someone under my command again,

06:43.278 --> 06:45.072
you will not be welcome on this base,colonel.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.490
Is that clear?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.370
Yes,it is.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.913
Good.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.206
We're done here.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.958
Thank you.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.544
Why would you lie to them?

06:58.544 --> 06:59.795
I didn't lie to them.

07:00.212 --> 07:03.423
It is most improbable that we complete our task within 10 hours.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.467
That is quitter talk.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.677
Look,you don't know me.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.679
This is when I'm at my best,this is when I shine--

07:08.679 --> 07:09.847
impossible deadlines.

07:09.847 --> 07:13.225
I ever tell you about the time I once got a damaged ancient hyperdrive system online moments

07:13.225 --> 07:15.561
before me and my crew were incinerated by a super volcano?

07:15.561 --> 07:17.479
Yes,you have.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.273
Well,there you go.See,I work best under pressure.

07:19.648 --> 07:23.569
Then perhaps I should threaten to feed on you if we do not complete the coding in time.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.820
Easy,easy.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.363
He's just kidding.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.073
Just tell them you were joking.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.660
Right.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.249
I'll work in this area.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.214
Time's up.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.757
So soon?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.259
I guess that means you're not ready.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.385
No,I'm not.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.595
Well,we're going with plan B.

07:49.595 --> 07:50.679
You want to go for a ride?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.014
No,I'll stay here.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.056
This still needs to get done.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.683
Good luck.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.614
Daedalus,this is the apollo,our scans are clear.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.199
We don't have any other contacts.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.325
Can you confirm?

08:11.366 --> 08:11.950
Copy that.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.076
We have the same reading.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.828
Colonel,how long before our guest arrives?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.246
Should be any second now.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.915
Won't they be surprised.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.583
We're going weapons hot,apollo.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.417
Copy that.

08:20.459 --> 08:21.710
We have done the same.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.712
I'm detecting a hyperspace window opening.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.007
Stand by to fire forward beam weapons.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.472
Fire.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.530
Contact has been neutralized.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.451
I wish I'd had these a few years ago.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.869
Well,the first attack is easy.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.120
They didn't know we were coming.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.542
The replicators have proven very effective in changing strategies when faced with failure.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.461
Still,we took that ship down without breaking a sweat.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.420
Right.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.630
One down.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.674
37 to go.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.470
one week later

09:16.014 --> 09:17.015
Welcome back,sir.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.101
We were in the neighborhood.Thought I'd stop by,resupply.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.227
How's it going out there?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.520
Splitting us up was a good call.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.188
The daedalus has downed another three ships.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.231
Ellis got another two.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.274
That brings us to seven.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.525
That's not bad at all.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.361
I'll need about an hour to get what we need,then we'll get back out there.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.738
Well,there's been a little change of plans.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.115
Really?

09:33.115 --> 09:33.949
Yeah.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.868
They're falling back?

09:35.868 --> 09:37.077
Safety in numbers.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.538
Evidently,they haven't figured out how we're tracking them and--

09:39.538 --> 09:41.582
or they haven't figured out how to stop us.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.750
Either way,they want to stop losing ships.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.502
So they're all headed back to the replicator home world.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.461
That's right.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.379
Well,that's good.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.922
They're finally all in one place.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.549
We can wipe them out all at once.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.258
Ideally,yes

09:51.300 --> 09:54.803
but our two ships versus an entire replicator fleet.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.681
not to mention the drones they'll be firing from the surface.

09:57.723 --> 10:01.852
The new weapons we have are very effective,but they are no match for that kind of fire power.

10:02.519 --> 10:07.566
Well,sounds like the perfect time to finally use that killer program you've been working on,doctor.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.484
Yeah.

10:09.484 --> 10:13.447
Remember when you said all you needed was 10 hours to finish it?

10:13.780 --> 10:14.865
Vaguely.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.074
Well,it's been 10 hours--

10:16.116 --> 10:17.034
and a week.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.160
Are you finished?

10:18.202 --> 10:20.996
Well,I'm just,um,dotting some "I"s,crossing some "t"S.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.540
Whatever our plan is,we need to act quickly.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.461
Our current intel suggests that they're putting all their resources into building new ships.

10:27.461 --> 10:31.757
I figure we have less than a week before they head back out into the galaxy,and in much greater numbers.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.801
If they start traveling in packs,our kill rate is going to drop drastically.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.345
We can't let that happen.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.555
We need to take them out while they're all in one place

10:38.597 --> 10:39.806
and we need to do it quickly.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.980
Hey,I should just get back to my lab.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.615
I have to tell them.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.200
I have to tell them we don't have anything.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.077
This is most troubling.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.870
Ellis is gonna love this.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.455
I don't get it.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.290
We tried reconfiguring your stand-down code,

11:05.290 --> 11:07.292
we tried programming the nanites to turn themselves off.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.752
Something should have worked.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.755
They are a very complex and ingenious design.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.549
Yeah,well,I thought I was ingeniouser.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.261
Yes,I know that's not a word,mr.Helpful.

11:17.928 --> 11:22.599
All right,look,maybe we could figure out some way to use the anti-replicator guns somehow.

11:23.225 --> 11:26.854
From what you have told me,they have almost certainly become immune to it.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.106
Even if they haven't,we'd still have to get them all in one place.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.652
What is it?

11:35.237 --> 11:37.698
I think I've got my first good idea in three weeks.

11:42.744 --> 11:47.624
Our old anti-replicator technology relied on disrupting the bonds between each individual nanite cell.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.169
They just collapsed in a pile of dust,right?

11:50.460 --> 11:53.046
We're familiar with the technology,yes.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.341
right,well,the thinking is always to continue down that line.

11:56.341 --> 12:00.304
to break the bonds,to turn them off,sever their connections to one another,

12:00.304 --> 12:02.389
because dust we can deal with,right?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.599
Rodney.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.434
We do the opposite.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.605
Instead of severing their connections,we significantly dial up their attraction to one another.

12:09.855 --> 12:13.233
We turn each cell into an incredibly powerful nanite magnet.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.986
You know,one cell attracts another cell,those two attract two more,

12:15.986 --> 12:19.281
and as more and more nanite cells bond to the core group,

12:19.281 --> 12:20.616
they become stronger and stronger and stronger,

12:20.657 --> 12:24.036
to the point where every replicator cell on the planet,in orbit,all of them,

12:24.077 --> 12:27.122
are amassed in this giant,super-dense blob.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.751
A super dense-blob?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.044
That's your great idea?

12:32.419 --> 12:34.296
It is,yes,actually.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.840
So what do we do with the blob,then?

12:36.882 --> 12:41.094
Aren't we in danger of creating some godzilla-sized super-replicator?

12:41.094 --> 12:41.845
No.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.096
At least not at first.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.015
This is not their normal form of bonding.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.517
I mean,it will take them some time to adapt,

12:46.517 --> 12:48.685
to figure out how to function within the new parameters.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.770
How much time?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.063
Well,I mean,I'd hate to speculate.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.314
Since when?

12:52.856 --> 12:55.025
Look,it doesn't matter anyways,because,long before that happens,

12:55.025 --> 12:58.278
they're going to fuse together so tightly,they will be rendered essentially inert.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.781
Remember,this bond is occurring on a subspace level--

13:00.781 --> 13:04.284
which helps get them past the normal repulsive force between nuclei--

13:04.326 --> 13:06.912
to the point where their electrons are fusing with their protons,

13:06.912 --> 13:08.747
and once that starts happening,they're toast.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.208
Yeah,but you're talking about neutron star levels of density.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.543
Precisely.

13:15.337 --> 13:18.549
It sounds crazy,but this could work.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.300
Well,how do we make it work,then?

13:20.342 --> 13:23.136
Just upload a new command into their base code?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.639
I have a better idea.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.103
Tah-dah.

13:31.103 --> 13:31.979
What's this?

13:32.020 --> 13:34.940
This-- this has been in storage since we found it a while ago.

13:34.940 --> 13:39.444
The ancients used it as part of their research into the creation of human form replicators.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.196
What are you suggesting?

13:41.196 --> 13:44.408
We have the technology,the understanding of nanite coding.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.077
We have the ancients' blueprints,for crying out loud.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.162
You want to make your own replicator?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.122
Not a whole one.

13:50.122 --> 13:53.041
Just a block of nanite cells,say,yay big--

13:53.333 --> 13:54.960
just enough to get the ball rolling.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.211
I don't know,rodney.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.297
I'm not talking about creating anything with normal replicator abilities.

13:58.297 --> 14:03.260
Just a group of nanite cells that can serve as a platform for us to upload the new bonding program.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.054
We take it to the replicator homeworld,we switch it on,

14:06.054 --> 14:07.264
we beam it into a populated area

14:07.306 --> 14:08.348
and we sit back and watch--

14:08.390 --> 14:09.600
it couldn't be easier.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.770
There is one problem.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.063
Only one?

14:15.063 --> 14:17.149
The replicators on the planet will be affected fairly quickly,

14:17.149 --> 14:19.693
but there will be a definite delay until there's enough mass

14:19.735 --> 14:21.320
to attract the nanite cells in orbit.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.614
So those ships will have plenty of time to escape.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.282
Unless we disable or destroy them.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.743
They have 30 ships,we have two.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.995
If we don't disable them,they're just going to fly away,

14:29.995 --> 14:31.538
lay low and replicate a new army.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.248
30 ships versus two.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.833
Can't be done.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.172
We might be able to get more ships.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.345
Depending on what has happened since I have been in captivity here,

14:47.137 --> 14:50.182
I can easily bring another 12 ships to the battle.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.352
12 ships-- willing to fight shoulder to shoulder?

14:53.852 --> 14:56.939
For a chance to destroy the replicators once and for all.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.107
of course.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.568
It at least brings the odds down to two to one.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.531
An alliance like this must be negotiated.

15:07.324 --> 15:12.204
I will need to personally convince them that this is the proper course of action.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.021
Sit down.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.236
First sign you've crossed us--

15:44.236 --> 15:45.821
I die.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.072
I know.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.136
Well,this is different.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.306
Receiving transmission.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.268
docking instructions.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.104
All right,let's get this over with.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.339
Now what?

16:48.050 --> 16:49.927
You open the door.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.351
Perhaps we should remove these.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.648
I think it sends the wrong message,don't you?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.441
This is a mistake.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.984
We need his help.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.740
I've got a bad feeling about this.

17:12.366 --> 17:15.160
Well,we're here,let's see it through.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.419
Take it easy,guys--

17:43.397 --> 17:46.400
all right,the basic nanite material has been formed.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.193
Let's see if we can get them to interact.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.737
I must say,rodney,this is quite an ingenious idea.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.114
Would you expect anything less?

17:52.281 --> 17:53.448
Well.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.658
what?

17:55.450 --> 17:57.077
Well,you have been in a bit of a rut lately.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.204
- I have not. 
- Okay,a dry spell maybe.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.122
That is not true.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.456
- It's not.
- Okay!

18:03.041 --> 18:06.545
Now,are we certain that these nanites will not go beyond simple cohesion?

18:06.545 --> 18:08.422
Of course.I've disabled most of the normal protocols.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.341
They won't be able to do anything beyond form a simple block.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.427
All right,here we go.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.268
It worked.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.227
You did it,rodney.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.020
Naturally.

18:23.020 --> 18:23.937
Mckay is back!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.814
Stop that.I was never gone.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.943
Whoa,wait a minute,we've got a problem.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.070
The cells aren't communicating properly.

18:37.993 --> 18:39.912
This could be tougher than I thought.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.164
And I don't want to hear you say anything.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.851
Be calm.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.356
Here.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.566
What the hell's going on?

19:09.983 --> 19:14.738
Apparently,my fellow wraith wanted to speak to me without you being around.

19:16.240 --> 19:20.035
They might have just politely asked us to stay in the jumper.

19:20.035 --> 19:23.330
Come,now,you would never have let me leave your sight.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.166
Well,we'll never know now,will we?

19:30.712 --> 19:32.464
We have a deal.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.425
seven hives will join us in the fight.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.219
Seven? You said 12.

19:37.553 --> 19:40.514
Not all of them were convinced the mission was achievable.

19:40.806 --> 19:43.725
Plus,many of our ships are without queens.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.937
We'd be unable to create new soldiers should they fall.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.314
If you'd prefer none.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.899
all right,seven.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.656
How did I wake up before ronon?

19:57.698 --> 20:00.325
We had to stun him several times.

20:01.451 --> 20:05.080
I thought it would be best that you were awake before he was.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.416
Probably a good idea.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.546
Are we in space?

20:12.588 --> 20:14.256
The hives have already left.

20:14.298 --> 20:17.176
They jettisoned your ship before they jumped into hyperspace.

20:17.634 --> 20:21.597
Anything else happen while we were unconscious that I should know about?

20:22.181 --> 20:26.226
I must return to atlantis to help dr.Mckay complete our plan.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.025
Help me wake them up and we'll get out of here.

20:38.572 --> 20:41.658
All right,looking good.

20:41.992 --> 20:44.369
Rodney,it's only being held together by a force field.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.078
I know.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.581
I just wanted to give the cells time to establish their own internal cohesion.

20:47.915 --> 20:53.378
Now we drop the field and they should hold together.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.589
Not bad,not bad.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.049
Structure is intact.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.259
Bonds are holding.

21:06.808 --> 21:07.935
Dammit.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.144
It's no use,rodney.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.271
You've disabled too many of the cells' basic protocols.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.524
It was never designed to work this way.

21:13.524 --> 21:15.359
In that case,there's only one thing we can do.

21:15.651 --> 21:16.985
Dr.Zelenka?

21:17.528 --> 21:18.320
Yes?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.197
They need to see you right away in section seven.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.491
We're having some power problems in the infirmary.

21:23.617 --> 21:24.701
I should go.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.245
This won't take too long.Is it all right if I--

21:26.286 --> 21:27.621
just go,go.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.456
you're probably holding me back anyway.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.719
Ronon,let it go.

21:43.554 --> 21:45.055
Take it as a compliment.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.807
they were afraid of you.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.394
Dial the gate.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.400
I'm detecting a hyperspace window forming.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.235
Your guys forget something?

22:08.787 --> 22:10.289
It's an ancestral warship.

22:10.289 --> 22:12.082
Replicators.Dial the gate.

22:12.791 --> 22:13.750
How did they find us?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.002
I have an idea.

22:15.419 --> 22:16.962
You are mistaken.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.714
Receiving transmission.

22:18.714 --> 22:19.840
What?

22:19.840 --> 22:21.800
Sheppard,that better not be you.

22:23.135 --> 22:24.678
Larrin?

22:26.054 --> 22:27.514
What the hell are you doing here?

22:27.890 --> 22:29.516
What the hell are you doing here?

22:29.516 --> 22:32.311
We picked up on seven hives orbiting a single planet.

22:32.311 --> 22:33.770
Seemed like something big was going down,

22:33.812 --> 22:36.732
so I thought we'd stop and do a little intel.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.150
Yeah,well,you just missed them.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.526
I see that.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.403
Now,tell me,what are you doing here?

22:41.403 --> 22:44.907
And better yet-- why didn't those hives destroy your puny little ship?

22:46.116 --> 22:48.327
I take great offense to that

22:48.368 --> 22:52.539
but those are all good questions,so we should talk.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.916
Yes,we should.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.834
Use bay three.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.962
Well,better her than the replicators,right?

22:58.962 --> 23:00.714
Let's see what kind of mood she's in.

23:09.181 --> 23:10.432
Larrin.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.852
that wraith better be a prisoner.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.562
Now,I know how it looks.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.146
Kill it.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.272
Whoa,hey,hey,hey!

23:17.272 --> 23:19.566
No killing,okay?

23:19.858 --> 23:22.611
Just hear me out.

23:23.278 --> 23:26.740
So,the idea is to keep the replicator ships from leaving orbit

23:26.740 --> 23:30.452
until this mckay guy can suck them back down to the planet?

23:30.869 --> 23:32.829
Couldn't have put it better myself.

23:33.038 --> 23:35.123
And since you only have two ships.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.875
we need the wraith to help.

23:37.668 --> 23:41.338
We figure the replicators have close to 30 ships guarding the surface.

23:41.338 --> 23:43.298
The wraith bring another seven to the fight.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.550
Still not very good odds.

23:44.550 --> 23:45.509
No,no.

23:45.509 --> 23:49.721
but unless we can,say,I don't know,meet someone with access to ships

23:49.763 --> 23:50.973
it will have to do.

23:52.724 --> 23:56.603
One of the planets we trade with was completely wiped out a few weeks ago.

23:56.645 --> 23:59.189
We thought it was the wraith,but it didn't fit.

23:59.857 --> 24:02.901
they weren't culled,they were leveled.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.695
Replicators.

24:05.487 --> 24:10.492
The last time we worked together,I said I'd let you keep a few secrets,

24:11.743 --> 24:13.453
but not anymore.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.623
If we do this,we go all the way.

24:16.915 --> 24:18.709
No holding back.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.462
All right.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.548
Look.

24:24.882 --> 24:26.758
your ship is still a mess.

24:27.092 --> 24:29.094
We have scientists that have the ancient gene.

24:29.094 --> 24:31.388
Maybe they can help you supe it up.

24:32.764 --> 24:35.058
Well,I'll have to talk to our governing council,

24:35.934 --> 24:37.853
but even if they agree to move forward,

24:38.103 --> 24:41.523
it'll be up to the individual ship captains if they want to join us or not.

24:41.857 --> 24:45.194
And fighting alongside the wraith isn't going to be popular.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.738
Well,we know how persuasive you can be.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.948
I'll start making the calls.

24:50.365 --> 24:51.617
Oh,great.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.827
This is all working out for the best--

24:53.827 --> 24:57.206
except for the part where I'm still tied up,larrin.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.667
Larrin?

25:06.673 --> 25:09.718
You and I have two very different definitions of "this won't take too long."

25:09.718 --> 25:10.594
I know.I'm really sorry.

25:10.636 --> 25:13.013
The naquadah generator in section seven is giving us all sorts of trouble,

25:13.013 --> 25:15.557
but it's fixed now,I'm all yours.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.558
What would you like to try now?

25:16.558 --> 25:19.603
Actually,unencumbered by the continual need to explain things to you.

25:19.603 --> 25:20.896
I've actually made remarkable progress.

25:20.938 --> 25:21.605
Oh,really?

25:21.939 --> 25:26.151
The systems the ancients had in place were designed to create fully-functional humanoid replicators,right?

25:26.151 --> 25:26.860
Yes.

25:26.902 --> 25:29.279
well,turns out that trying to create something much simpler is,

25:29.279 --> 25:30.948
ironically,much more difficult.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.075
In the end,I was forced to compromise.

25:33.867 --> 25:34.910
Wait,you're not suggesting that--

25:34.910 --> 25:36.078
I know it wasn't part of the plan,

25:36.078 --> 25:37.996
but it was either this or nothing.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.672
Hello.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.971
Oh,my.

26:04.523 --> 26:06.650
check on mckay,see if he made any progress.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.318
I must go see dr.Keller.

26:08.318 --> 26:09.444
Why's that?

26:09.444 --> 26:10.696
I was stunned.

26:10.696 --> 26:11.947
We get stunned all the time.

26:11.989 --> 26:12.948
Shake it off.

26:12.948 --> 26:14.992
The circumstances are different.

26:14.992 --> 26:16.326
How so?

26:19.621 --> 26:21.456
I am carrying a child.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.042
You're what?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.755
I am pregnant,john.

26:29.965 --> 26:31.967
Is this a joke?

26:32.801 --> 26:34.219
Don't look at me.

26:34.261 --> 26:35.846
It just happened.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.473
I didn't even know you were seeing anybody.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.392
It is no one from atlantis.

26:42.603 --> 26:45.772
How far along are you?

26:45.772 --> 26:48.066
About three months.

26:48.734 --> 26:52.237
three-- how long have you known?

26:52.613 --> 26:53.655
Just under two.

26:54.364 --> 27:00.704
We've been-- you let me put you out in the field when you've known you were three months pregnant?

27:00.704 --> 27:02.080
I tried to tell you.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.832
You didn't try hard enough.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.667
I am more than capable of--

27:05.667 --> 27:07.044
you got stunned today.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.546
Do you have any idea what kind of effect that could have?

27:09.963 --> 27:13.425
Athosian woman remain very active in the community--

27:13.425 --> 27:14.843
this is different.

27:16.053 --> 27:18.388
We get shot at,beat up,stunned.

27:18.388 --> 27:20.682
we take a chance every time we walk through the gate.

27:20.682 --> 27:21.517
John.

27:21.517 --> 27:25.604
as of this second,you are relieved from active duty.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.654
congratulations.

27:34.029 --> 27:35.364
Kanan is the father?

27:35.364 --> 27:36.406
You knew that we were--

27:36.406 --> 27:37.699
I could tell.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.618
The way you talked about him.

27:41.370 --> 27:44.498
Yes,he is the father.

27:44.998 --> 27:46.375
I'm sorry.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.293
I will find him.

27:49.378 --> 27:51.046
He is still alive.I feel it.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.130
We'll find him.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.507
Together.

27:53.841 --> 27:55.551
I promise.

27:56.677 --> 27:57.719
Come on.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.137
Let's go get you checked out.

28:02.057 --> 28:04.518
You know "ronon," it's a good name.

28:04.518 --> 28:05.602
Boy or girl.

28:08.605 --> 28:10.440
So that brings the grand total to.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.358
14.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.485
Larrin said she can get three or four more ships.

28:13.527 --> 28:14.653
That's great.

28:14.695 --> 28:15.821
Yeah.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.114
You okay?

28:17.155 --> 28:18.282
Yeah.

28:18.657 --> 28:20.534
I'm taking teyla off active duty.

28:20.868 --> 28:21.660
Why?

28:21.660 --> 28:22.870
She's pregnant.

28:26.582 --> 28:27.833
Who's the father?

28:29.459 --> 28:30.752
I never asked.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.006
It has been one hell of a day.

28:34.923 --> 28:36.216
But there's one more thing you need to see.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.051
Mckay has kind of thrown us a curve ball.

28:38.051 --> 28:38.760
Great.

28:38.802 --> 28:40.679
I was just thinking we need more of those today.

28:47.144 --> 28:50.022
This is not what we talked about,rodney.

28:50.022 --> 28:52.649
Yeah,well,I'm sorry,but the block idea didn't fly.

28:52.649 --> 28:53.859
This was the only way.

28:53.859 --> 28:56.653
You have any idea what kind of a security threat this is?

28:56.653 --> 28:57.905
It's not as bad as you think.

28:57.905 --> 29:00.407
I've stripped down its programming as much as I possibly could

29:00.449 --> 29:01.909
without sacrificing basic viability.

29:01.909 --> 29:05.913
It can walk,it can talk,but it can't replicate or change its form or anything.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.457
Does she know why she was created?

29:08.457 --> 29:09.750
Of course.

29:10.459 --> 29:12.711
Well,then she has a certain amount of self-awareness.

29:12.711 --> 29:13.795
Yeah,so?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.047
So?

29:15.297 --> 29:18.842
Honestly,I'm not sure how comfortable I am sending her to her death.

29:19.218 --> 29:20.385
Death?

29:20.385 --> 29:21.595
It can't die.

29:21.595 --> 29:22.471
It's not alive.

29:22.471 --> 29:23.680
It's a program.

29:23.972 --> 29:26.517
Her "consciousness" is just a bunch of ones and zeros.

29:26.517 --> 29:29.269
I mean,you can call it "she" all you want,but it's still just a thing.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.312
It's a prop.

29:30.312 --> 29:32.940
It's a really advanced radio-controlled weapon.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.358
I mean,you don't feel sorry for your bullets,do you?

29:34.358 --> 29:35.692
Your bombs?

29:35.692 --> 29:36.818
All right,still.

29:38.487 --> 29:39.613
It's weird.

29:39.655 --> 29:41.949
Yeah,well,at the end of the day,it doesn't matter anyway,

29:41.949 --> 29:43.659
because we don't have any other choice.

29:45.619 --> 29:47.704
Well,we are teaming up with the wraith.

29:47.746 --> 29:49.831
I guess it's that kind of a mission.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.130
We have a problem.

29:57.130 --> 29:57.798
What is it?

29:57.798 --> 29:59.591
I've been going over your calculations.

30:00.217 --> 30:02.553
I thought it would be prudent,for the good of the mission.

30:02.928 --> 30:04.221
I hope you don't mind.

30:04.221 --> 30:05.472
No.No,it's fine.

30:05.472 --> 30:10.143
I think you've underestimated how quickly the nanite cells will adapt to their changing circumstances.

30:10.686 --> 30:14.982
The mass will be able to manipulate its own form before it reaches critical density.

30:15.315 --> 30:17.192
- Are you sure? 
- I'm quite positive.

30:17.568 --> 30:21.154
Once the nanites regain control,they will be able to halt their own collapse.

30:21.488 --> 30:24.074
At that point,they will be extremely dangerous.

30:24.074 --> 30:26.618
In other words,we're back to godzilla.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.580
I may have a solution.

30:34.543 --> 30:37.379
We overload their zpms,about half a dozen of them,

30:37.379 --> 30:39.923
in a symmetrical pattern around the replicator mass.

30:40.215 --> 30:43.010
The force of the explosion causes the mass to compress even further,

30:43.051 --> 30:46.221
essentially creating our own replicator fusion bomb.

30:46.221 --> 30:47.764
The whole planet will be destroyed in the process.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.224
You don't mess around,do you?

30:49.933 --> 30:53.228
All this is based on information provided by a replicator?

30:53.270 --> 30:54.980
We have no reason to trust it.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.192
We're not trusting it,we're trusting rodney.

30:58.942 --> 31:00.986
Now,this causes a slightly new wrinkle to the plan.

31:00.986 --> 31:02.738
I'll need to beam down to the core room--

31:02.738 --> 31:04.615
along with ronon and a squad of marines.

31:04.948 --> 31:09.119
From there,I should be able to hack into their system and set the zpms to overload.

31:09.119 --> 31:11.496
We'll be keeping their ships occupied.

31:11.830 --> 31:16.543
The seven hives will space themselves around the planet equally and our smaller ships will fill in the holes.

31:16.919 --> 31:18.712
We could use you in my chair,air,sheppard.

31:18.962 --> 31:22.591
We have an arsenal of drones,but none of my guys can fire them quite like you can.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.304
No place I'd rather be.

31:28.388 --> 31:34.061
The hives will be dispatching sizable waves of darts to target the replicators' hyperdrive engines.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.604
My 302s will join you.

31:35.604 --> 31:36.897
Very well.

31:36.897 --> 31:39.983
Now,while I'm working in the core room,we'll beam fran down to the city.

31:40.025 --> 31:42.319
Wait a minute-- fran?

31:42.361 --> 31:44.196
Friendly replicator android.

31:45.030 --> 31:47.616
I didn't realize we were naming things.

31:48.075 --> 31:50.827
It noticed that zelenka and I both had names,and.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.915
and she asked for one,so.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.544
all right,let's move out.

32:16.228 --> 32:17.729
That's quite a sight.

32:18.689 --> 32:22.025
I remember when the cold war ended and we started doing joint missions with the russians.

32:23.485 --> 32:25.070
I thought that was strange.

32:26.655 --> 32:28.490
I've got confirmation from the fleet.

32:28.490 --> 32:29.533
We're ready to go.

32:29.533 --> 32:31.326
Set coordinates for the replicator home world.

32:54.016 --> 32:56.768
This is quite exciting,isn't it?

32:57.769 --> 32:59.396
It's a bit nerve-wracking.

33:00.063 --> 33:01.732
I quite look forward to it.

33:02.733 --> 33:03.734
You do?

33:03.734 --> 33:06.653
One always wishes to fulfill one's purpose.

33:07.154 --> 33:08.363
Right.

33:08.739 --> 33:10.782
and you're fine with all this?

33:10.824 --> 33:12.117
Why would I not be?

33:12.117 --> 33:14.119
It's my reason for being.

33:14.119 --> 33:15.245
I know,I just.

33:15.746 --> 33:17.831
you're going to.cease to be.

33:17.831 --> 33:18.582
Yes?

33:18.624 --> 33:21.835
I imagine you'd rather keep being than.

33:22.461 --> 33:24.296
than not.

33:24.296 --> 33:27.508
Certainly,you're not worried for me,are you,doctor?

33:27.549 --> 33:28.509
No,no.

33:28.509 --> 33:29.635
That would be silly.

33:30.010 --> 33:31.678
Yes,it would.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.725
We should never have given it speech.

33:36.725 --> 33:37.559
Yeah.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.478
Dr.Mckay,we're approaching the target.

33:39.478 --> 33:41.855
You need to get with ronon and the marines.

33:42.523 --> 33:43.899
On my way.

33:44.608 --> 33:46.318
Dr.Mckay.

33:46.944 --> 33:48.070
yeah?

33:48.487 --> 33:50.155
Good luck.

33:52.157 --> 33:53.450
You,too,fran.

33:54.535 --> 33:55.994
good luck.

34:15.179 --> 34:18.766
Target their hyperdrives with the beam weapons and launch all 302s.

34:19.059 --> 34:22.478
Beam the replicator and mckay's team down to their separate coordinates.

34:34.616 --> 34:35.993
fan out.Fan out.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.789
All right,we're clear.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.542
This won't take more than a minute.

34:58.765 --> 35:00.517
Power down in interior section.

35:00.517 --> 35:03.812
Transferring power from non-critical systems to hull regeneration.

35:09.318 --> 35:10.527
How's it coming,mckay?

35:10.527 --> 35:11.778
I don't want to be doing this all day.

35:12.571 --> 35:13.614
I'm done.

35:13.614 --> 35:19.328
I've got total control over the power grid and the zpms,and fran is.

35:19.661 --> 35:21.580
fran is just about to activate.

35:25.959 --> 35:27.628
Hello.

35:47.231 --> 35:49.691
It's working.just hold those ships off a little longer.

36:06.708 --> 36:08.919
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up.

36:08.919 --> 36:10.254
We just have to keep them busy.

36:10.254 --> 36:12.130
I don't think they realize what's happening yet.

36:20.097 --> 36:23.141
One of the replicator ships is heading towards us at maximum sublight.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.810
They're powering their hyperdrives.

36:24.852 --> 36:25.853
Sheppard.

36:25.894 --> 36:26.979
do you see that?

36:26.979 --> 36:27.855
Yeah.

36:27.855 --> 36:28.939
I got it.

36:43.495 --> 36:45.581
It's working much faster than I ever imagined.

36:46.373 --> 36:48.709
when's it going to be big enough to start pulling them down from orbit?

36:48.750 --> 36:50.377
Soon.Really soon.

36:52.546 --> 36:54.173
Our shields can't take much more of this,sir.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.674
Hopefully,they won't have to.

36:56.175 --> 36:59.595
Get ready to transfer power from the beam weapons to the--

37:11.815 --> 37:12.858
what the hell.

37:12.858 --> 37:14.443
son of a bitch.

37:15.402 --> 37:17.237
he actually did it.

37:28.498 --> 37:29.625
What's happening?

37:29.625 --> 37:30.792
The replicator mass.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.045
it's so heavy,it's sinking into the planet surface.

37:34.171 --> 37:38.592
Mckay,according to our readings,every replicator nanite is now part of the mass.

37:38.592 --> 37:39.843
Can you confirm?

37:39.843 --> 37:41.011
Copy that,sam.

37:41.011 --> 37:43.305
I'll set the countdown and--

37:43.972 --> 37:45.390
Did you do that?

37:45.390 --> 37:46.600
No.

37:48.352 --> 37:49.770
it's the mass.

37:49.770 --> 37:52.814
It's collapsed the subterranean power grid.it's a black out.

37:53.649 --> 37:55.651
We won't be able to overload the zpms.

38:05.661 --> 38:07.704
Not good.Not good.

38:07.704 --> 38:09.331
Do you want me to beam down there and help you?

38:09.331 --> 38:12.000
The grid has been completely destroyed,there's nothing either of us can do.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.252
What's the big deal?

38:13.252 --> 38:14.753
You can't overload zpms.

38:14.753 --> 38:17.464
Why don't we just send some nukes down there?

38:17.506 --> 38:19.091
It's not that simple as that!

38:19.091 --> 38:22.928
In order to implode a mass this large,the explosion has to be timed down to the nano second.

38:22.928 --> 38:24.304
The force needs to be exactly right.

38:24.304 --> 38:27.057
you can't just fire a few nukes down here and get the job done.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.644
It's gotta be better than nothing.

38:30.686 --> 38:31.979
I have to agree.

38:31.979 --> 38:36.066
Mckay,my sensors indicate that the ground around the mass is rich with neutronium.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.025
Neutronium?

38:37.067 --> 38:39.069
It's the base raw material of replicator cells.

38:39.403 --> 38:42.698
Makes all the sense in the world why the ancients would set up on a planet where it's abundant.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.157
This could be very useful.

38:44.157 --> 38:46.118
Neutronium is incredibly dense.

38:46.451 --> 38:48.078
And that helps us how?

38:48.078 --> 38:49.705
Sam,we are geniuses!

38:49.746 --> 38:52.416
The mass is so super heavy that it's sinking into the planet's surface,

38:52.416 --> 38:54.418
but if I dial it up,just a little bit,

38:54.751 --> 38:57.838
it'll attract the neutronium and sink all the way to the core.

38:57.838 --> 39:00.716
And the planet will exert enough pressure on it to cause an implosion.

39:03.177 --> 39:05.846
Just give me one more.

39:06.847 --> 39:08.098
got it!

39:18.525 --> 39:19.610
we need to get out of here.

39:19.651 --> 39:20.903
All right,let's go,come on!

39:31.914 --> 39:34.791
As much as I'd love to,we shouldn't stick around to watch this go down.

39:34.791 --> 39:37.377
We should tell the fleet to jump to the rendez-vous point immediately.

39:37.377 --> 39:38.962
The planet's become unstable.

40:03.028 --> 40:04.446
I'm sorry you lost a ship.

40:04.821 --> 40:06.281
They knew what they were getting into.

40:06.281 --> 40:07.449
Yeah,but still.

40:07.866 --> 40:10.410
You gonna stick around and let my guys check this place out?

40:10.744 --> 40:13.705
They already gave us a head start when they got us battle ready.

40:14.164 --> 40:17.584
Besides,I have some things that need to get taken care of.

40:17.584 --> 40:18.710
Yeah? Like?

40:19.419 --> 40:22.172
Nothing for you to concern your pretty little head with.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.632
Look,um.

40:24.550 --> 40:27.052
now that we're allies and stuff.

40:27.970 --> 40:31.181
I should probably have some way of contacting you--

40:31.181 --> 40:33.308
you know,for professional reasons--

40:33.308 --> 40:35.060
in case we need help again.

40:36.228 --> 40:38.063
I know where atlantis is now.

40:38.105 --> 40:39.231
don't worry.

40:39.231 --> 40:40.774
I'll stay in touch.

40:41.149 --> 40:43.318
Colonel sheppard,are you ready to beam?

40:44.403 --> 40:45.779
Good seeing you again.

40:46.113 --> 40:47.614
I bet it was.

40:51.535 --> 40:53.370
Ready to beam.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.047
Welcome back.

41:04.089 --> 41:05.174
Good to be back.

41:05.549 --> 41:07.509
How are our good friends,the wraith?

41:07.509 --> 41:09.344
They never showed up at the rendezvous point.

41:10.554 --> 41:12.014
Think they got caught in the explosion?

41:12.014 --> 41:12.973
I doubt it.

41:12.973 --> 41:16.018
I guess they just figured there was nothing left to talk about,so,

41:16.393 --> 41:18.812
as soon as the planet blew up,we were back to being enemies.

41:19.354 --> 41:20.814
Wraith back to being enemies.

41:21.148 --> 41:23.775
Replicators don't exist anymore,you out of your dry spell.

41:24.985 --> 41:26.695
all is right with the world.

41:27.696 --> 41:29.031
What are you working on anyway?

41:29.031 --> 41:32.659
You'll be surprised to hear that removing a planet from the database is actually a lot of work.

41:32.951 --> 41:34.870
I thought you'd be pretty good at that by now.

41:35.162 --> 41:36.622
You just can't resist bringing up the fact

41:36.622 --> 41:38.874
that I once accidentally destroyed a couple of planets,can you?

41:39.166 --> 41:40.876
It was an entire solar system.

41:41.835 --> 41:43.128
You want to do the honors?

41:43.128 --> 41:44.338
No,you go ahead.

41:45.047 --> 41:49.426
All right,m7r-227,you were a constant pain in the ass.

41:49.426 --> 41:50.802
It's good to see you go.

41:53.972 --> 41:55.432
If only it was that easy in real life.

41:55.474 --> 41:56.600
Area 51 is working on it.

41:56.934 --> 41:58.477
Late dinner?

41:58.519 --> 41:59.353
Absolutely.

41:59.353 --> 42:00.354
All right.

42:00.395 --> 42:02.856
I would have loved to have seen ellis' face when my plan worked.

42:03.273 --> 42:04.316
Such a tool.

42:04.691 --> 42:05.943
I like him.

42:05.943 --> 42:06.818
- You do? 
- Yeah.

42:06.818 --> 42:08.487
Good guy,excellent judge of character.

42:08.487 --> 42:09.780
Oh,I see.

42:11.698 --> 42:13.075
I see where you're going with that.

42:30.342 --> 42:31.635
Our intel was correct.

42:31.635 --> 42:33.595
The planet has been completely destroyed.

42:34.179 --> 42:36.390
Can you detect any trace replicator cells?

42:36.765 --> 42:37.641
Negative.

42:37.683 --> 42:39.476
they've been completely wiped out.

42:40.561 --> 42:42.104
Good.

42:42.396 --> 42:45.983
We can finally get to work without having to look over our shoulders.

42:47.985 --> 42:50.195
It's time to begin.
