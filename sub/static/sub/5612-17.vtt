WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.042
Sure thing, bud.

00:03.043 --> 00:04.544
I'm trying to send
Genevieve a sexy pic.

00:04.545 --> 00:05.878
Does this make
my bubble butt pop?

00:05.946 --> 00:07.113
Nope.
I'm out.

00:10.350 --> 00:13.653
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

00:13.654 --> 00:16.856
Um, excuse me, pal.
Think you're at my desk.

00:16.857 --> 00:18.257
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:18.258 --> 00:19.325
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!

00:19.326 --> 00:20.526
Don't be a dum-dum.

00:20.527 --> 00:22.929
Squad, meet
Detective Adrian Pimento.

00:22.930 --> 00:24.810
He's been deep undercover
for the last 12 years,

00:24.865 --> 00:28.267
but he's just resurfaced,
and he's rejoining the Nine-Nine.

00:28.335 --> 00:30.937
That... is...

00:30.938 --> 00:32.338
awesome!

00:52.426 --> 00:54.360
Some of you just met
Detective Pimento,

00:54.361 --> 00:56.841
and, of course, some of you knew
him before he went undercover.

00:56.897 --> 01:00.299
Hitchcock and Scully. Ha.
You guys still work here?

01:00.300 --> 01:03.035
The only way they're getting
rid of us is in a body bag.

01:03.036 --> 01:05.872
It actually happened once,
but it was a false alarm.

01:05.873 --> 01:08.341
Detective Pimento will be
returning to his old desk.

01:08.342 --> 01:10.576
Peralta will temporarily be
moved to the break room.

01:10.577 --> 01:11.576
Questions?

01:11.612 --> 01:12.845
What'd you do undercover?

01:12.846 --> 01:14.213
I worked for
Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis.

01:14.214 --> 01:16.949
That is an A-list mobster.
Tell me literally everything.

01:16.950 --> 01:18.084
Everyone, shut up!

01:18.085 --> 01:20.453
Pretty much just
a bagman for him.

01:20.454 --> 01:22.321
I mean, I did some other stuff.

01:29.763 --> 01:33.199
Um, we usually try to tell
funnier little stories.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.534
Well, there's nothing
funny about what I did

01:34.535 --> 01:35.601
for The Butcher.

01:35.602 --> 01:37.003
I've had to learn not to blink,

01:37.070 --> 01:39.761
because every time I close
my eyes, I see a fresh horror.

01:39.806 --> 01:40.907
Ooh, dark.

01:40.908 --> 01:42.074
But how do you keep
your eyes moist?

01:42.075 --> 01:43.376
Actually, I have

01:43.377 --> 01:45.545
a very funny story
about keeping my eyes moist.

01:52.786 --> 01:54.453
Come on...

01:54.454 --> 01:55.453
Nope.

01:55.489 --> 01:56.769
Still not getting
that vibe, man.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.124
- Really?
- Mm-mm.

01:58.192 --> 02:00.226
I'll get there.
That's my bad, everybody.

02:00.227 --> 02:01.494
Dismissed.

02:02.586 --> 02:05.998
Sir, can I partner with
Pimento on my B&E?

02:05.999 --> 02:07.066
That guy is awesome.

02:07.134 --> 02:08.701
He's like a real life
Donnie Brasco.

02:08.702 --> 02:11.668
Isn't Donnie Brasco a really
sad movie that ends terribly?

02:11.705 --> 02:12.972
Yeah, but he's got
that cool jacket,

02:12.973 --> 02:14.340
and he's always
down at the docks.

02:14.341 --> 02:15.808
I'm not sure I want
you working with Pimento.

02:15.809 --> 02:17.043
He's a little unstable.

02:18.512 --> 02:20.446
Machine!

02:20.447 --> 02:23.388
Psychologically, this could be
a very difficult transition.

02:23.417 --> 02:24.951
Yeah, I know, I went undercover.

02:24.952 --> 02:26.953
63 days, no big deal.
You probably forgot.

02:26.954 --> 02:28.685
No, it's your outgoing
voice mail message.

02:28.722 --> 02:29.722
<i>Hey, it's Jake.</i>

02:29.790 --> 02:31.190
Can't get to the phone
right now.

02:31.191 --> 02:34.393
I might be undercover again,
like I was for 63 days.

02:34.394 --> 02:35.561
Bye!

02:35.629 --> 02:37.930
Look, I know what
he's going through.

02:37.931 --> 02:40.132
Let me be the man
that brings him in from the cold.

02:40.133 --> 02:42.068
All right, he can work
the B&E with you.

02:42.069 --> 02:43.970
Just make sure you take it easy.

02:43.971 --> 02:46.505
Uh, sir, I was 20 minutes late
for work today.

02:46.506 --> 02:48.774
I don't think you need to
tell me about taking it easy.

02:48.775 --> 02:51.010
Are you bragging
about being a bad employee?

02:52.779 --> 02:54.714
No.

02:54.715 --> 02:56.349
Dismissed? Me?

02:56.416 --> 02:58.551
I figured out the best way

02:58.552 --> 03:00.586
to welcome Pimento
to the Nine-Nine.

03:00.587 --> 03:03.189
Stay out of his way,
maybe buy him a drink,

03:03.190 --> 03:04.624
not do anything weird?

03:04.691 --> 03:06.259
I'm making him a goat stew.

03:06.326 --> 03:08.183
Huh... all right.

03:08.228 --> 03:11.097
Yeah, now,
this Turkmenistani dish

03:11.098 --> 03:14.367
is traditionally made from
an animal that's been so overfed

03:14.368 --> 03:15.941
it can no longer stand.

03:16.003 --> 03:17.536
That's the dream.

03:17.537 --> 03:18.938
Everything is authentic.

03:18.939 --> 03:20.840
I even ordered
the pressure cooker

03:20.841 --> 03:22.008
from Turkmenistan.

03:22.075 --> 03:23.376
So you're on a terrorist
watch list now?

03:23.377 --> 03:25.845
Oh, yeah, Homeland Security's
been in my house, yep.

03:25.846 --> 03:29.215
Now, this just needs to cook for
another 11 hours, 32 minutes,

03:29.216 --> 03:31.817
and 6...

03:33.186 --> 03:36.455
What the hell, Boyle!
You almost killed me!

03:36.523 --> 03:38.758
I'm not going out
in a stew-making accident!

03:38.825 --> 03:40.993
Terry's gonna die
saving the President,

03:40.994 --> 03:43.062
or Terry's never gonna die!

03:43.063 --> 03:45.798
There's no way we can
clean this up by ourselves.

03:45.799 --> 03:47.166
We're gonna need help.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.701
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:48.702 --> 03:49.702
What are you saying?

03:49.770 --> 03:52.038
You know what she's saying, man.

03:52.039 --> 03:54.006
Oh, no.

03:54.007 --> 03:55.474
Mean Marge.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.710
So we're supposed to come
running to clean up your mess

03:57.711 --> 03:59.912
every time you snap
your fat little fingers?

03:59.980 --> 04:01.447
Oh, no, no, I actually
can't snap my fingers,

04:01.448 --> 04:02.581
they're always too wet.

04:02.582 --> 04:04.150
And I just thought,
since it's your job...

04:04.151 --> 04:05.718
Oh, I see.

04:05.719 --> 04:08.387
You cops think you're too good
to clean up after yourselves?

04:08.388 --> 04:10.289
Uh... no, I can do it myself,
I'll just...

04:10.290 --> 04:11.657
That's union work!

04:11.725 --> 04:14.827
How dare you try
to steal our jobs.

04:14.828 --> 04:16.762
So where do we go from here?

04:16.829 --> 04:18.798
Well, you know the old saying,

04:18.798 --> 04:22.134
"The only way to unclog a toilet
is to let it sit."

04:22.135 --> 04:24.103
You're a janitor.
You should know that's not true.

04:24.171 --> 04:26.005
Boys, take out the trash.

04:26.073 --> 04:27.707
Oh, great!
So you will do it?

04:27.774 --> 04:29.075
Oh!
I'm the trash, I get it.

04:29.076 --> 04:30.676
Okay, that makes more sense
with your tone.

04:31.678 --> 04:34.013
Oops! Oh...
Love you, Marge.

04:34.014 --> 04:35.881
You wanted to see me, sir?

04:35.949 --> 04:37.750
Yes, I have a special
project for you.

04:37.751 --> 04:39.151
Okay, but I'll have
you know right now

04:39.152 --> 04:40.776
I only fly first class.

04:40.821 --> 04:42.254
I'm not flying you anywhere.

04:42.255 --> 04:44.657
I made an application to
the M.C. Guffin Foundation

04:44.658 --> 04:46.559
for a grant to upgrade
our office equipment.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.395
Unfortunately, they require
a video submission.

04:49.396 --> 04:51.364
I understand you have
some filmmaking experience.

04:51.431 --> 04:54.066
Well, you know, I've been
re-Vined by Rob Kardashian,

04:54.067 --> 04:56.001
so, yeah, I'm a director.

04:56.002 --> 04:57.203
Here's what I'm picturing:

04:57.204 --> 05:00.373
I enter, in, like,
a Fellini-style getup.

05:00.374 --> 05:02.141
Rosa's dressed
like a porcupine...

05:02.142 --> 05:03.909
Oh, no, no.
We're just gonna do a simple,

05:03.910 --> 05:05.778
straightforward tour
of the precinct

05:05.779 --> 05:07.213
featuring Detective Diaz and me.

05:07.280 --> 05:08.447
Are you sure?

05:08.448 --> 05:11.817
You're not our most dynamic
screen presences.

05:11.818 --> 05:12.985
I can be dynamic.

05:12.986 --> 05:14.387
Exclamation point.

05:14.388 --> 05:16.722
Well, Diaz and I have
that kind of easy chemistry

05:16.723 --> 05:18.591
- where we finish each other's...
- Sentences.

05:18.592 --> 05:20.626
Please, don't interrupt me.

05:20.627 --> 05:23.662
That kind of nonsense
won't happen on camera.

05:23.663 --> 05:25.264
Hey, hey, Pimento.

05:25.265 --> 05:26.265
Hey!

05:26.266 --> 05:28.033
This is my desk, okay?

05:28.034 --> 05:30.903
Okay, well,
now that that's out of the way,

05:30.971 --> 05:33.072
I was just coming to let you
know we're gonna work

05:33.073 --> 05:35.274
a B&E together;
we're gonna be partners.

05:35.275 --> 05:37.209
Nope.
I work alone.

05:37.210 --> 05:39.378
Plus, The Butcher says
he has spies in the NYPD,

05:39.379 --> 05:41.614
so I trust none of these dildos.

05:41.615 --> 05:43.482
Listen, you can trust me.

05:43.483 --> 05:45.484
- I'm, like, obsessed with you.
- Fine.

05:45.552 --> 05:48.421
Tell me something you've never
told another living soul.

05:48.422 --> 05:49.688
Um...

05:49.689 --> 05:51.056
Ooh, here's one.

05:51.057 --> 05:53.893
I'm actually not strong enough
to lift a water cooler jug,

05:53.894 --> 05:55.394
so I always find a way
to make Terry do it.

05:55.395 --> 05:56.762
Here's mine.

05:56.763 --> 05:58.297
Jimmy "The Butcher" made me
drive a croquet wicket

05:58.298 --> 06:01.333
through a guy's eyes
into his brain.

06:01.334 --> 06:04.570
Brain leaked out his eyes
like he was crying his own mind.

06:04.571 --> 06:06.205
My goodness.

06:06.206 --> 06:07.606
Now that I've heard yours,

06:07.607 --> 06:09.442
I feel like
my water cooler thing

06:09.443 --> 06:10.943
could have been
a little more juicy, but...

06:10.944 --> 06:13.679
No. That was
embarrassing for you.

06:13.680 --> 06:14.980
A bond has been made.

06:16.798 --> 06:18.617
Feels good to trust again,
brother.

06:18.618 --> 06:20.586
Wow, either you are a cyborg

06:20.587 --> 06:23.556
or you're carrying
so many weapons in this jacket.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.025
Hey.
Kitchen, now.

06:26.026 --> 06:27.126
Okay.

06:27.127 --> 06:28.327
What's up?

06:28.328 --> 06:29.895
Something's not right
about that guy.

06:29.896 --> 06:31.764
Why, just because he keeps
threatening to kill me

06:31.765 --> 06:33.899
in the middle of a police
precinct? Uh, grow up.

06:33.967 --> 06:35.301
Because I'm physically
attracted to him.

06:35.368 --> 06:36.869
And that's bad?

06:36.937 --> 06:39.004
the Vulture, the ShamWow guy,

06:39.005 --> 06:40.372
and when I was a kid,

06:40.373 --> 06:41.974
I had a major crush
on the evil Gremlin.

06:41.975 --> 06:43.676
Stripe?
Are you crazy?

06:43.743 --> 06:45.144
Yeah, well I'm not
gonna bone Gizmo.

06:45.145 --> 06:47.146
- I would.
- Careful with Pimento.

06:48.315 --> 06:49.615
It's gonna be fine.

06:53.334 --> 06:54.386
Hey, partner.

06:54.454 --> 06:56.453
- Oh!
- I've been waiting for you.

06:58.034 --> 06:59.596
Sorry if I surprised you.

06:59.597 --> 07:00.995
It's just when I was undercover,
the middle of the night

07:00.996 --> 07:03.109
was the only time
I could do actual police work.

07:03.110 --> 07:05.306
Uh, how'd you get
in the apartment?

07:05.307 --> 07:06.574
Oh, it was easy.

07:06.575 --> 07:08.108
I just seduced
the old lady upstairs,

07:08.109 --> 07:10.945
came down the fire escape,
jimmied the window open.

07:10.946 --> 07:13.547
Bing-bang-boom, I'm inside
your living quarters.

07:13.615 --> 07:15.082
Totally.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.651
Course, next time you could just
give me a call, you know.

07:17.652 --> 07:19.086
Two ways to pop in on a friend.

07:19.087 --> 07:20.254
I didn't kill
the old lady upstairs,

07:20.255 --> 07:21.422
if that's what
you're worried about.

07:21.489 --> 07:22.790
Well, I am now.

07:22.791 --> 07:24.124
Oh, wait a minute.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.093
You think I'm being weird.

07:26.094 --> 07:28.262
Oh, I shouldn't have come here.
This is your apartment.

07:28.263 --> 07:32.199
I'm so sorry, Jake!
Stupid, Paul!

07:32.200 --> 07:33.934
Stupid!
You idiot, Paul!

07:33.935 --> 07:35.469
- Hey! Pimento!
- Huh?!

07:35.537 --> 07:37.871
- Who's Paul?
- Whoa.

07:37.872 --> 07:39.573
Paul Sneed
was my undercover name.

07:39.574 --> 07:41.075
'Kay?
Damn it, Jake.

07:41.076 --> 07:42.457
I don't know who I am anymore.

07:42.510 --> 07:44.111
You could have chose
any name to go undercover,

07:44.112 --> 07:45.112
and you picked Paul Sneed?

07:45.113 --> 07:46.113
Seems kind of crazy.

07:46.114 --> 07:47.214
I shouldn't have come here.

07:47.215 --> 07:48.682
This was a mistake.
I'm not ready.

07:48.683 --> 07:51.085
I knew I wasn't ready
to go back to being police.

07:51.086 --> 07:53.287
It's the only job I've ever had
except for bagging groceries

07:53.288 --> 07:55.990
at the supermarket at the corner
of Atlantic and Clinton.

07:55.991 --> 07:58.025
I guess I could go back
to that again.

07:58.026 --> 07:59.460
"Paper or plastic?"

07:59.461 --> 08:00.861
Yeah, still got it.

08:00.862 --> 08:02.730
Listen to me, I was undercover.

08:02.731 --> 08:06.367
63 days with the Mafia.
I saw some messed-up stuff.

08:06.368 --> 08:08.369
I know what your struggle is.

08:08.370 --> 08:12.339
And I can bring you home,
but you've got to trust me.

08:12.340 --> 08:14.742
Okay. Yeah.

08:14.809 --> 08:17.444
Great. Now, I've got
to get some sleep.

08:17.445 --> 08:19.913
You're welcome to stay here
and work the case if you want.

08:19.914 --> 08:20.948
Thanks, partner.

08:20.949 --> 08:23.584
I promise I won't
disturb you at all.

08:24.653 --> 08:27.721
Whuuuhhhh.

08:27.789 --> 08:30.824
Whuuuhhhh.

08:30.825 --> 08:32.359
- Hey, Pimento.
- Huh?

08:32.427 --> 08:34.260
I thought you were just gonna
be looking through the files

08:34.261 --> 08:35.462
- or something, man.
- Sorry, brother.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.563
Tai chi helps
keep the demons at bay.

08:37.631 --> 08:38.899
Right.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.900
And...

08:40.902 --> 08:42.202
Do you have to do it
in your underwear?

08:42.203 --> 08:43.736
I can't take them off,

08:43.738 --> 08:46.440
'cause then you'd be looking
right at my penis and testicles.

08:46.508 --> 08:49.209
Can't argue with that logic.
Mm-kay.

08:51.746 --> 08:54.048
Why is there
so much garbage in here?

08:54.115 --> 08:56.483
Mean Marge
won't clean up the stew.

08:56.484 --> 08:58.919
And also, she suspended
our trash service.

08:58.987 --> 09:00.287
What happened?

09:00.288 --> 09:02.022
You didn't grovel enough,
did you?

09:02.023 --> 09:04.692
Seriously, Amy,
you're gonna ask Charles Boyle

09:04.693 --> 09:06.860
if he groveled enough?
Come on!

09:06.861 --> 09:08.495
This is the grossest thing
I've ever seen,

09:08.496 --> 09:10.130
and I have three kids
under the age of four.

09:10.198 --> 09:11.699
I live in a house of fluids.

09:11.766 --> 09:13.534
Look, I have a plan, okay?

09:13.535 --> 09:15.402
We're just gonna go over
Mean Marge's head

09:15.403 --> 09:16.403
and we're gonna tell Holt.

09:16.404 --> 09:17.638
Tell me what?

09:17.639 --> 09:19.039
Oh, well, I don't know
if you noticed,

09:19.107 --> 09:21.075
but there was an accident
in the break room yesterday.

09:21.142 --> 09:24.611
Oh, yes, shattered windows,
bones everywhere.

09:24.612 --> 09:27.314
It's very "New York in the 70s."
Clean it up.

09:27.382 --> 09:29.616
The, uh, problem...

09:29.617 --> 09:32.953
is Marge in facilities
is refusing to help.

09:33.021 --> 09:35.456
We were actually hoping
maybe you could ask her.

09:35.457 --> 09:36.457
Excuse me?

09:36.458 --> 09:38.358
I'm the captain
of this precinct.

09:38.359 --> 09:41.195
I don't have time to mediate
your petty squabbles.

09:41.196 --> 09:44.231
I've taken a sacred oath
to protect this community,

09:44.232 --> 09:46.800
and that is a job
I take seriously.

09:46.868 --> 09:48.188
So you're afraid of her, too,
huh?

09:48.236 --> 09:49.417
Terrified.

09:53.274 --> 09:55.476
Yeah, perp knew
where the camera was.

09:55.477 --> 09:56.944
Must have cased the joint
ahead of time.

09:56.945 --> 09:58.779
We're gonna need all
your footage from the past week.

09:58.780 --> 10:01.515
Ha-ha-ha.
This is an amateur job.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.317
Everybody knows you break in
when the owner's there.

10:03.318 --> 10:05.119
That way you have guaranteed
access to the safe,

10:05.120 --> 10:07.054
and you can kick his teeth in
to send a message.

10:07.055 --> 10:08.655
Okay, why don't you just...

10:08.656 --> 10:10.224
Oh, sure, you could
slit his throat, but then

10:10.225 --> 10:11.558
what are you going to do
with all the blood?

10:11.559 --> 10:13.994
Uh, we'd leave it in his body,
where blood lives,

10:13.995 --> 10:15.295
because we're cops.

10:15.296 --> 10:17.564
Oh, right, we're cops.
And don't worry, sir.

10:17.565 --> 10:19.366
We're gonna
catch these bastards,

10:19.367 --> 10:22.035
- or my name isn't Paul Sneed.
- Adrian Pimento.

10:22.036 --> 10:24.371
Adrian Pimento.
So, what'd they take?

10:24.372 --> 10:26.373
About $15,000 worth of stuff.

10:26.374 --> 10:29.276
TVs, cameras,
bunch of pre-paid cell phones.

10:29.277 --> 10:31.111
Ooh, you sell burner phones?

10:31.112 --> 10:32.846
What kind of deals
you got on those?

10:32.847 --> 10:34.081
Why do you want
to know about the deals?

10:34.082 --> 10:36.316
Just gathering evidence
for the case,

10:36.317 --> 10:37.885
'cause I'm a cop, remember?

10:37.886 --> 10:40.387
- Detective Paul Sneed.
- Adrian Pimento.

10:40.388 --> 10:44.458
Adrian Piment... I... I know who I am...
you know what... forget this!

10:44.459 --> 10:45.459
Ah... okay.

10:47.595 --> 10:50.197
Hey, hey, hey, come on, man.

10:50.265 --> 10:53.267
Look, I get it...
you're still tense.

10:53.268 --> 10:55.002
When I came back
from being undercover,

10:55.003 --> 10:56.503
they made me see a shrink.

10:56.504 --> 10:58.372
But then he told me I had
dad issues, and I was like,

10:58.373 --> 10:59.807
"You know what,
you can't tell me what to do,

10:59.808 --> 11:01.740
you're not my dad,"
so he was a moron.

11:01.776 --> 11:03.710
No, you know what, that's good
advice... thanks, man, thanks.

11:03.711 --> 11:05.831
I... I'll be right back,
I just left something inside.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.417
Hey, give me one of those.

11:10.485 --> 11:13.921
Why are you buying
a burner phone?

11:13.922 --> 11:15.756
Cue smoke machine.

11:15.757 --> 11:18.192
And... action Holt.

11:20.261 --> 11:22.996
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.

11:22.997 --> 11:25.199
And I'm Detective Rosa Diaz.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.167
I don't understand why
I'm on a wheelchair.

11:27.168 --> 11:28.669
Cut!

11:28.670 --> 11:32.206
For the last time, Rosa, through
the magic of special effects,

11:32.207 --> 11:34.675
the wheelchair
will turn into a horse,

11:34.676 --> 11:36.777
but I need you to work with me.

11:36.778 --> 11:38.912
Give me a little "hee-yah!"
Hee-yah!

11:38.913 --> 11:40.247
This is idiotic.

11:40.248 --> 11:42.316
Maybe because you didn't
karate chop your way

11:42.317 --> 11:44.384
through the smoke, as scripted.

11:44.452 --> 11:45.552
I'm out.
Scully.

11:45.620 --> 11:46.820
Rosa!

11:46.888 --> 11:48.956
Hee-yah, hee-yah.

11:48.957 --> 11:50.123
I wanted a simple,
straightforward

11:50.124 --> 11:51.525
video tour of the precinct,

11:51.526 --> 11:54.194
and you've added the one
ingredient I didn't want:

11:54.195 --> 11:55.195
pizzazz.

11:55.196 --> 11:57.664
Pizzazz is who I am.

11:57.665 --> 12:00.601
Would you tell the sky
to stop being so blue?

12:00.602 --> 12:02.336
- Yes. I wish it were tan.
- What?

12:02.337 --> 12:04.571
It's my favorite color.
It's no-nonsense.

12:04.639 --> 12:06.740
Hey, I've been tailing Pimento,

12:06.741 --> 12:08.075
and I think you were right.

12:08.142 --> 12:09.843
<i>There's something weird
going on with that guy.</i>

12:09.844 --> 12:11.378
I knew it. Ugh!

12:11.379 --> 12:13.046
I can't believe
I'm gonna sleep with him.

12:13.047 --> 12:15.249
Well, you don't have to.

12:15.316 --> 12:16.550
No, I'm gonna.

12:16.618 --> 12:18.652
He secretly
bought a burner phone,

12:18.653 --> 12:19.853
he broke into my apartment

12:19.921 --> 12:21.241
<i>and he keeps forgetting
he's a cop</i>

12:21.289 --> 12:23.223
and calling himself
by his alias, Paul Sneed.

12:23.224 --> 12:24.524
Paul Sneed?

12:24.525 --> 12:26.326
<i>He said Figgis has spies
in the NYPD.</i>

12:26.394 --> 12:28.962
Rosa, what if he's one of them?
What if he turned?

12:28.963 --> 12:30.898
Oh, here he comes.

12:30.899 --> 12:33.200
Oh, man, bolt cutters?

12:33.201 --> 12:34.468
Bolt cutters have literally

12:34.469 --> 12:35.949
never been used by
an innocent person.

12:36.004 --> 12:37.437
I use them all the time
when I make jewelry.

12:37.438 --> 12:38.939
What?
Oh, my God.

12:38.940 --> 12:40.207
Follow-up questions later.

12:40.208 --> 12:41.408
All right, I got to
keep following him.

12:41.409 --> 12:42.943
All right, but be careful.

12:42.944 --> 12:45.612
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll be invisible.

12:45.613 --> 12:47.648
Now you see me, now you...

12:47.649 --> 12:49.616
<i>- ♪ 'Cause here's my number
- Ah...</i>

12:49.617 --> 12:50.984
<i>♪ So call me maybe</i>

12:50.985 --> 12:53.287
We're cool, we're cool.

12:53.288 --> 12:55.448
Everything's still cool.
He didn't hear me, we're cool.

13:02.715 --> 13:03.715
Rosa.

13:03.716 --> 13:04.983
Pimento just put on a ski mask

13:05.050 --> 13:06.985
<i>and broke into a creepy
abandoned warehouse.</i>

13:06.986 --> 13:07.986
Mm, that's hot.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.354
It is?

13:09.355 --> 13:10.588
Oh, wait, he's coming back out.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.090
<i>Did he do something super shady?</i>

13:12.158 --> 13:13.246
Are his eyes all wild?

13:13.292 --> 13:14.926
- Rosa, focus.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

13:14.994 --> 13:16.528
Send a pic. Bye.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.329
Okay, guess we're done talking.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.668
Well, they still haven't
cleaned up in there,

13:23.736 --> 13:26.271
but the good news is
I got a new plan.

13:26.338 --> 13:28.973
I let one of the perps
accidentally get out of holding,

13:28.974 --> 13:31.276
then I take him down
to the break room.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.511
Oopsie.
Now it's a whole crime scene.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.727
And then we can get
crime scene cleaners.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.749
- Boom.
- Not so fast.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.064
That room gets clean
when I say it gets cleaned.

13:40.085 --> 13:41.853
You can't stop us now.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.688
You ever heard the old saying,

13:43.689 --> 13:46.191
"Know the garbage,
know the man?"

13:46.258 --> 13:47.358
That's not a saying.

13:47.359 --> 13:50.628
Yes, it is.
I know all your secrets.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.063
Boyle.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.831
You got a taste for fast food.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.533
Those aren't mine.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.235
I only eat
locally-sourced meats.

13:57.236 --> 13:58.736
They could be Terry's.
He was fat once, you know?

13:58.737 --> 14:00.171
What the hell, Boyle?

14:00.172 --> 14:01.306
Speaking of Jeffords,

14:01.373 --> 14:03.107
maybe your daughters
would like to know

14:03.108 --> 14:05.798
that their daddy throws away
all their drawings?

14:05.844 --> 14:08.213
They just draw so many,
and they're all so bad.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.148
And you, Santiago,

14:10.216 --> 14:12.383
maybe the world would like to
see that draft of a memo

14:12.384 --> 14:16.287
you wrote where you used
T-H-E-I-R instead of T-H-E-R-E?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.256
Oh, you sick son of a bitch.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.591
Why do you hate us so much?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.659
I know you call me Mean Marge.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.461
Do you even know my last name?

14:23.462 --> 14:24.862
Hmm?

14:24.863 --> 14:27.732
- Mop-Bucket?
- Scully, don't guess.

14:27.733 --> 14:28.900
- Please.
- No.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.268
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.471
"Mop-Bucket," Scully?

14:33.472 --> 14:35.036
It was a educated guess.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.443
Thanks for coming.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.578
Pimento put the duffel in his
trunk, parked around the corner,

14:40.579 --> 14:42.280
and went home; he's been doing
shirtless tai chi

14:42.281 --> 14:43.281
in his window ever since.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.582
Which window is that?

14:47.453 --> 14:49.821
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.122
Look, I got to
get into that trunk.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.657
And you need me
to break into the car for you?

14:52.658 --> 14:53.658
What?
No, I can do it.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.126
Why would you say that?

14:55.127 --> 14:57.395
Because one time you lost your keys
and you called a tow truck.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.364
My mom pays for
roadside assistance.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.600
Why wouldn't I call it?
I'm doing this.

15:05.804 --> 15:09.207
Okay, great take!
You guys are finally getting it.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.710
All right, let's go again.
Action Holt!

15:15.214 --> 15:18.716
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.853
And I'm Detective Rosa Diaz.
Hee-yah.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.187
The hell is this?

15:23.255 --> 15:26.457
You had a pizzazz problem,
so you've been recast, sweetie.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.859
Welcome to Hollywood.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.662
You know, David here
really connected with the role.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.231
The key is to invent
a backstory for your character.

15:33.232 --> 15:36.934
Now, my Raymond Holt is addicted
to pills, but no one knows.

15:37.002 --> 15:40.638
You see, he really
understands the craft,

15:40.639 --> 15:43.808
whereas you and Rosa just sort
of flop around

15:43.809 --> 15:45.743
like a couple of boring normals.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.445
I'm sorry, but we're detectives,

15:47.446 --> 15:49.247
not professional actors.

15:49.248 --> 15:50.548
We were trying our hardest.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.717
- "We were trying our hardest."
- Stop it.

15:52.718 --> 15:56.087
Gina, this is a disgrace.
I'm removing you as director.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.623
There he goes.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.258
Off to take more pills.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.694
Oh, yeah.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.096
Suck it, roadside assistance.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.464
Well, well, well.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.865
Hello, Jake.

16:07.866 --> 16:10.335
Adrian, what a coincidence
bumping into you here.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.336
Well, see you tomorrow.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.705
You know what,
let's hang out now.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.906
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.575
What are you doing here,
partner?

16:17.643 --> 16:18.643
<i>Pimento's still in the windo.</i>

16:18.644 --> 16:20.011
Come on, Jake.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.280
You honestly didn't assume
I would hire a look-alike

16:22.281 --> 16:24.615
to wear a fake beard
and do tai chi in my window?

16:24.616 --> 16:26.417
No, I definitely
didn't assume that.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.152
And plus, you seriously
thought that was me?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.721
I mean, you've seen me
in my underpants.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.589
My butt is rock hard.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.024
That guy's got a pancake butt.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.792
I can't believe you're still
working for Figgis.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.260
That's why you've been
acting so weird.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.962
Breaking into my apartment,
buying a burner phone,

16:37.963 --> 16:39.530
grabbing this duffel.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.199
I broke into your apartment
'cause I didn't feel safe

16:41.200 --> 16:42.600
- at my home.
- Okay.

16:42.601 --> 16:44.302
And a burner phone is
the only kind of phone I can get

16:44.370 --> 16:45.970
because I disappeared
for 12 years,

16:45.971 --> 16:48.072
- and now have terrible credit.
- Makes sense.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.941
You want to know
what's in the duffel?

16:49.942 --> 16:51.709
Open it up, tough guy.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.480
Oh, look at that.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.850
A bunch of old family photos
and personal belongings.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.385
Pimento's mementos.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.486
I know you have a gun on me.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.554
I just couldn't
resist the rhyme, sorry.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.490
I stashed it all
when I became Paul Sneed.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.157
I couldn't have them
finding anything

17:07.159 --> 17:08.291
that could
trace back to my family.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.660
I get it, all right?

17:09.661 --> 17:11.483
I went through the exact
same thing when I came back...

17:11.497 --> 17:14.432
You have no clue
what I've been through!

17:14.433 --> 17:16.733
You know what?

17:16.734 --> 17:18.435
I can't believe I trusted you.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.204
Okay.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.473
Just get out of here, Jake.

17:23.474 --> 17:25.476
<i>Oh, my God, this guy's
got a pancake butt.</i>

17:25.477 --> 17:27.712
It's not Pimento.
Get out of there, Jake!

17:27.713 --> 17:29.046
Thanks, Rosa.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.140
So Detective Pimento
didn't show up for work today.

17:32.141 --> 17:33.274
Any idea why?

17:33.342 --> 17:34.909
Oh, yeah, I straight up
drove him off.

17:34.910 --> 17:36.677
Big screw-up on my part.

17:36.745 --> 17:38.954
I'm trying this new thing
where I just own my mistakes.

17:38.955 --> 17:40.777
- I like it. Do you?
- I did.

17:40.778 --> 17:42.545
- Until you bragged about it.
- Yeah.

17:42.546 --> 17:43.880
Pimento left his gun
and badge on my desk,

17:43.881 --> 17:46.282
along with a note reading,
"I can't do this.

17:46.283 --> 17:48.084
I'm better off as a bagman."

17:48.152 --> 17:49.452
Oh, no.

17:49.453 --> 17:51.020
You think he went back
to work with Figgis?

17:51.021 --> 17:52.021
Worse.

17:52.022 --> 17:53.756
Fine, single bag it.

17:53.757 --> 17:55.892
It's your funeral,
you dumb son of a bitch.

17:55.893 --> 17:58.227
Get out of here.

17:58.228 --> 17:59.227
Idiot.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.531
Hey, partner.

18:01.532 --> 18:02.965
Bag boys don't have partners.

18:02.966 --> 18:04.233
Actually, cashiers and bag boys

18:04.234 --> 18:05.635
need to be totally in sync...

18:05.636 --> 18:07.170
Shut up, Maggie.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.405
Look, man, you sacrificed
12 years of your life

18:09.406 --> 18:11.574
for the police department;
you're a hero.

18:11.575 --> 18:13.609
I'm sorry
that I didn't trust you.

18:13.610 --> 18:15.778
Yeah. Me too.

18:15.779 --> 18:19.449
Look, can I tell you something
I've never told anyone before?

18:19.450 --> 18:23.820
My time undercover in the Mafia
was actually kind of lame.

18:23.821 --> 18:25.988
I mean, I wanted it
to be badass,

18:25.989 --> 18:27.890
but I'm good at computers,
so I mostly just helped them

18:27.891 --> 18:29.158
switch over from AOL.

18:29.159 --> 18:32.295
I have no idea
what you're going through.

18:32.296 --> 18:35.164
And I want to tell you that it's
all gonna go back to normal,

18:35.165 --> 18:37.033
but honestly, I have no clue.

18:39.636 --> 18:41.704
Anyways, the footage came back
on that B&E,

18:41.705 --> 18:43.206
and we've got a suspect.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.567
I'm going to bust him right now
if you want to come with me.

18:48.078 --> 18:49.345
Why don't you
give me those eggs?

18:49.346 --> 18:50.480
I'll put them on top here.

18:51.815 --> 18:53.549
Okay.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.338
What was that about?
What happened to you?

18:55.352 --> 18:56.753
Maggie, butt out!

18:56.754 --> 18:58.755
Okay?
This is my life!

18:58.756 --> 19:00.123
So I just received word

19:00.124 --> 19:01.891
from our friend
at the Guffin Foundation.

19:01.892 --> 19:04.227
Apparently they loved
our video submission.

19:04.294 --> 19:05.661
What did you send them?

19:05.729 --> 19:07.897
A cinematic masterpiece
is what I sent them.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.310
Did it feature pizzazz?

19:09.366 --> 19:11.267
No, none at all, sir.

19:11.268 --> 19:13.669
First, I couldn't wrap my head
around that concept,

19:13.670 --> 19:15.171
but then I realized:

19:15.172 --> 19:17.607
do you know which dogs get
the most likes on the internet?

19:17.608 --> 19:19.142
Anatolian Shepherds.

19:19.143 --> 19:21.611
No, ugly little runts

19:21.612 --> 19:25.515
with wonky eyes and tongues
that won't stay in their mouths.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.916
But the Anatolian Shepherd

19:26.917 --> 19:28.484
is unrivaled
for protecting livestock.

19:28.485 --> 19:30.186
I was trying to wow them,

19:30.187 --> 19:34.023
and I should have just been
showcasing our wonk-eye.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.591
<i>♪ I will remember you</i>

19:35.592 --> 19:38.728
<i>We were trying our hardest,
but this is a disgrace.</i>

19:38.729 --> 19:40.897
<i>Disgrace, disgrace.</i>

19:40.898 --> 19:42.927
<i>Help us.
Stop it.</i>

19:44.334 --> 19:48.171
And that's real audio of
your very-real diva meltdown.

19:48.172 --> 19:51.240
You might just make it
as an actor after all.

19:51.241 --> 19:52.475
Well done, Linetti.

19:52.543 --> 19:53.676
Sergeant Linetti.

19:53.677 --> 19:55.878
I had the fake Holt
give me a promotion.

19:55.879 --> 19:57.713
He signed the papers
and everything.

19:59.450 --> 20:00.650
What do you want?

20:00.651 --> 20:03.252
To tell you that we will
officially be renaming

20:03.320 --> 20:08.891
the fourth-floor break room
"The Marge Bronigan Break Room."

20:08.892 --> 20:10.226
Well.

20:10.227 --> 20:11.627
Looks like somebody
did their homework.

20:11.695 --> 20:13.162
It was me.
I did it.

20:13.230 --> 20:14.230
So what's the catch?

20:14.231 --> 20:16.299
The ceremony
starts in two hours.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.168
Now, I know our squad
is not in the janitor's union,

20:19.169 --> 20:20.803
but it'd sure be nice
if we were allowed

20:20.804 --> 20:23.105
to clean the place up
before then.

20:24.687 --> 20:26.342
<i>We cleaned up the stew,</i>

20:26.343 --> 20:31.848
which means the Marge Bronigan
Break Room is open for business!

20:31.849 --> 20:34.951
Okay, we'll take out your trash,
do normal cleaning,

20:34.952 --> 20:36.285
but no big messes.

20:36.286 --> 20:38.254
Great!
Time for the christening.

20:41.758 --> 20:43.693
Oh, crap.

20:47.564 --> 20:49.398
Congratulations.

20:49.399 --> 20:52.602
Perp is on the third floor.
Everyone know your assignment?

20:52.603 --> 20:53.970
Mind if I tag along?

20:53.971 --> 20:55.271
Pimento?

20:55.272 --> 20:56.439
I thought about it.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.107
If you say things
will get back to normal,

20:58.108 --> 21:00.610
then I trust you.

21:00.611 --> 21:02.044
All right.

21:02.045 --> 21:03.045
Let's do this.

21:03.046 --> 21:05.715
You're with me, partner.

21:05.716 --> 21:07.950
NYPD! You're under arrest!

21:07.951 --> 21:09.719
You're gonna die!

21:09.720 --> 21:11.420
No, Pimento!
No!
