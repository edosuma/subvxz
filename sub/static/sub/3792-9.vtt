01:25.210 --> 01:27.295
- I cannot find this place.
- Why are you too proud

01:27.379 --> 01:29.589
to use your navigation system?
Ask yourself that.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.049
I tried the navigation, Turtle.
It can't find it either.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.176
Oh, that's too bad 'cause

01:33.260 --> 01:35.178
you're about to miss
the day's last bit of sun.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.221
Just tell me where to turn.
I'm on Poplar.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.766
Uh, I don't know Poplar.
Why don't you head back down the hill?

01:39.850 --> 01:41.601
- I'll give you directions from Sunset.
- I don't even know

01:41.685 --> 01:44.103
where the bottom is. Why did we have
to move all the way up here anyway?

01:44.188 --> 01:45.897
'Cause it's an insane house,
that's why.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.774
Well, for 30 G's a month it should be.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.233
Oh, stop stressing about money.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.277
Vince says if he never
makes another dollar

01:51.361 --> 01:54.489
his advance check from "Clouds" can
keep us in this house for 16 months.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.157
- 18 months.
- 18 months.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.868
Oh, that will stop me from stressing.
Okay, wait a second,

01:58.952 --> 02:00.995
wait a second. I think I'm
heading back down right now.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.497
Durand Drive...
Does that sound familiar?

02:02.581 --> 02:04.081
Yeah yeah, turn there.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.794
- God damn it.
- What?

02:07.878 --> 02:09.920
Some girl just ran into me.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.340
Oh my God, I think it's Anna Faris.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.633
Really?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.134
You know what? Let me call you back.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.719
What happened?

02:17.221 --> 02:19.388
Anna Faris just smashed into E.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.725
Sweet.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.854
- Did you not see me?
- Oh, I am so sorry.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.856
I just... I got distracted for a second.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.483
It's totally my fault.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.318
Well, it's okay. It was an accident.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.946
Um, would you mind
not coming any closer?

02:35.030 --> 02:38.491
Why? You think I'm, like, some kind
of a crazy fan or something?

02:38.575 --> 02:41.118
No no, it's just that I'm in a towel.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.663
I just got done with Pilates
and I forgot a change.

02:43.747 --> 02:47.166
And, you know, who wants to wear
sweaty clothes after a shower?

02:47.251 --> 02:49.001
So you decided
to drive home in a towel?

02:49.086 --> 02:50.795
- Yeah. It's a little weird, huh?
- Not weird.

02:50.921 --> 02:54.173
It's just not very practical
in case you got in an accident.

02:54.258 --> 02:57.468
Yeah. Um... so what now?

02:58.095 --> 03:01.389
Well, I guess
I've got to get your insurance, right?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.516
I don't have my wallet.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.142
Okay, you're just a mess today.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.230
But your fly is down.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.108
No, it's not.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.361
I'm sorry, I just wanted to
take some of the attention off me.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.364
Look, I'm feeling a little exposed.
Can I give you my number?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.949
I'm gonna be home in, like, 10 minutes

03:20.033 --> 03:21.701
and then I'll give you
everything you need.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.952
Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.871
Let me get my phone
and get your number.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.707
- I'm really sorry.
- That's okay. It'll be all right.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.001
What time's dinner, Daddy?

03:30.085 --> 03:31.878
As soon as I'm done
with this script, sweetie.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.255
- Okay.
- Oh my God,

03:34.339 --> 03:35.965
that is so funny!

03:37.426 --> 03:40.344
No, you are kidding me.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.805
That is so funny.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.390
Oh my God, too funny.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.142
Will you shut up?

03:46.226 --> 03:49.854
Okay then. Um, yes, ASAP.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.107
Okay. Thank you so much.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.151
Well, guess who that was.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.153
Um... Let me see,

03:57.237 --> 03:59.864
it was Cara Grossman
and she wants to know

03:59.948 --> 04:01.073
if she should
get her eyebrows

04:01.158 --> 04:02.575
waxed first or if you should.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.369
It was my old producer
from "The Young and the Restless. "

04:05.454 --> 04:08.331
- What did he want?
- Me.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.457
I don't get it.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.959
Well, it's the 35th
anniversary of "Y&R"

04:12.044 --> 04:15.046
and they want me
to reprise my role as Kendall Scott.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.255
Are you serious?

04:17.341 --> 04:18.423
I am.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.345
It seems that Kendall still
gets quite a bit of fan mail

04:22.429 --> 04:24.597
and the writers
were in a bind and they've come up

04:24.681 --> 04:26.432
with a little idea
that could work for tomorrow.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.559
- I hope you told them no.
- I told them we'd talk about it.

04:28.644 --> 04:31.145
We talked about it.
So you tell them no.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.022
We have not talked about it, Ari.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.941
Well, honey,
what is there to talk about?

04:35.025 --> 04:37.944
I don't know, um...
Tell me that it's exciting

04:38.153 --> 04:40.154
and that if I did it, I'd be good.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.074
It's a soap opera, baby. There is no
good, there's just degrees of bad.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.952
Well, then tell me
that I would be pretty,

04:46.161 --> 04:47.912
as pretty as the day I left the show.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.622
Well, you left the show
when you were 25

04:49.706 --> 04:52.833
and now they shoot
everything in high def.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.211
You are such an asshole!

04:55.295 --> 04:57.338
- Come on, baby.
- Yeah, right. Well, ask anybody,

04:57.422 --> 04:59.632
you've aged a lot worse
than I have, baby.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.052
Come here, honey.
Where are you going?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.304
- To call my producer...
- For what?

05:05.389 --> 05:08.557
...and tell him
Kendall Scott, town slut, is back.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.689
What's up, boys?

05:14.773 --> 05:18.567
Pfft, for a guy who just
got into an accident, you seem happy.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.319
Maybe he's got a head injury.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.446
It's a fender-bender, Drama.
I'm fine. Are you nuts?

05:22.531 --> 05:24.824
Well, I hope you didn't
tell Ms. Faris that,

05:24.908 --> 05:26.575
'cause we're gonna sue
the crap out of her.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.661
We're not suing anybody.
There's barely any damage.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.371
Yeah, visible damage,

05:30.455 --> 05:32.581
but internal damage
is a whole other thing.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.001
- Let it go, Drama.
- E, come on, what's up?

05:35.085 --> 05:36.836
I don't know. She's cute.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.838
- That she is.
- We had a little moment.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.965
- Pfft. No shot.
- No way.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.010
You're not a member
of the celeb club, bro.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.012
- It'll never happen.
- I got her number.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.973
I crashed into an 80-year-old woman
once. She gave me her number too.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.766
Whatever. I'm calling.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.353
I bet my left nut
he could not close Anna Faris.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.355
Oh, gee, a bet I'd love to win.

05:56.440 --> 06:00.026
- Shit.
- What happened?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.653
She gave me the wrong number.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.321
Aw, don't feel too bad, E.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.199
You're just
a regular person, a civilian.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.826
Too bad she didn't hit me.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.786
We'd be fucking by now.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.797
- Good morning, Ari.
- Is that smirk for me

06:21.882 --> 06:23.799
or are your Ben Wa balls shifting?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.551
Just wondering how you're feeling

06:25.635 --> 06:27.595
about not being the biggest star
in your house anymore.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.680
Oh, don't be a wiseass.
How did you know?

06:29.765 --> 06:32.266
- It's on Defamer.
- You're kidding.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.061
Oh, Ari, be proud of her.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.604
She's gonna light up the screen

06:36.688 --> 06:38.606
and bring a newfound excitement
to Genoa City.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.983
- You watch that shit?
- "Y&R" is fourth

06:41.068 --> 06:42.985
on my TiVo Season Pass priority list.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.070
I haven't missed an episode
in 12 years.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.237
That is so sad.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.739
You should go down
to the set today, Ari.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.365
Watch your wife's work,
be supportive.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.368
I've got my own life's work
to support, Lloyd.

06:58.502 --> 06:59.668
Lloyd!

07:01.505 --> 07:03.339
Who the hell is this?

07:05.592 --> 07:08.219
That's the underage
student she seduces, Julio.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.054
It's not a great picture.
I have a better one.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.597
It's my screen saver, if you wanna see.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.557
- Clear my schedule.
- Even your lunch?

07:13.642 --> 07:16.477
I'm going to be eating
Julio's lunch today.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.939
Hi, Julio.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.067
- I got it.
- Got what?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.194
Anna Faris's address.
Wait till she sees me

07:25.278 --> 07:27.321
show up on her doorstep.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.573
What? I should pay for the car?

07:29.658 --> 07:31.951
E, is this really about the money

07:32.035 --> 07:33.702
or is this about your little moment?

07:33.787 --> 07:36.497
- We did have a moment.
- She's an actress.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.333
- So what, I'm an idiot?
- No, she's a good actress.

07:39.417 --> 07:43.212
Is E still bitching
about being bitch-slapped by a bitch?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.380
He's rightfully upset.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.632
Yeah, well, let it go.
We have bigger problems.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.176
What's that Turtle? Pink Dot
insisting on seeing a note before you

07:49.261 --> 07:51.178
- use Vince's credit card again?
- Ho ho ho.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.638
They discontinued his favorite weed.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.014
Ourfavorite weed,

07:54.099 --> 07:56.809
and it's not discontinued,
it's extinct, gone forever.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.811
Like the Yangtze River dolphin.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.647
I gotta wait for the cable guy today.
How am I gonna do that with no weed?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.691
Why don't you pick up
one of the other 50 kinds of weed

08:03.775 --> 08:04.942
you've been living off
for the last 20 years?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.569
I'm too distraught.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.988
Turtle, what if I was to tell
you that I have a secret stash

08:09.072 --> 08:11.490
of the most-recently-extinct
Aurora Borealis

08:11.575 --> 08:13.325
in a box in the living room?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.161
I would say if I wasn't
worried about appearances,

08:15.245 --> 08:16.745
I would kiss you
right now, Vin. How much you got?

08:16.830 --> 08:19.039
Enough to make waiting
for the cable guy tolerable.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.457
Fantastic.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.168
You know what?
Maybe I'll stick around,

08:22.252 --> 08:24.670
cook us a nice lunchtime feast.
You do the shopping.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.463
If I pick the menu.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.382
Done. You in, E?

08:28.466 --> 08:30.176
I can't.
Got too much stuff to do today.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.135
I'll see you guys later.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.929
What's he gotta do?

08:34.681 --> 08:37.015
I really miss this lovely canvas.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.268
Oh, well,
I hope I don't disappoint, Steven.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.187
It's really nerve-wracking

08:41.270 --> 08:43.522
when you haven't been
in front of the camera for so long.

08:43.607 --> 08:47.151
Don't worry. You look as good
as ever and you will be fantastic.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.695
Surprise, honey.
Your husband has arrived.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.614
Ari, what are you doing here?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.824
Well, I wanted to see your work.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.076
I wanted to be the supportive husband
and meet your colleagues.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.953
Hello, how are you?
Ari Gold. Nice to meet you.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.705
I am the man behind
this beautiful woman.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.082
Your wife has the most amazing skin.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.210
- She does, doesn't she?
- Uh, Steven,

09:04.294 --> 09:06.962
do you think you could give
us just a couple seconds?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.256
Uh-huh, sure. Whatever you need.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.466
Okay.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.259
Ari, really, what are you doing here?

09:12.344 --> 09:13.385
I heard about your scene.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.888
Oh, come on, it's a soap.
What did you think I was gonna be doing?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.182
I don't know,
discovering that your husband

09:18.266 --> 09:20.559
is really your
long-lost tranny cousin?

09:20.644 --> 09:22.228
Who gives a shit? All I know is

09:22.312 --> 09:24.521
I don't want another
man's lips on my wife.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.565
- It's barely a kiss.
- And how are your kids

09:26.650 --> 09:28.359
going to explain that in school

09:28.443 --> 09:30.361
when people ask why their Mommy

09:30.445 --> 09:32.738
is on TV barely kissing Juan Valdez?

09:32.822 --> 09:35.741
Sarah's best friend's mother just got
raped on "Criminal Minds" last week.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.786
A) rape is involuntary
and B) it's prime time.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.788
- You are such an asshole.
- Baby,

09:40.872 --> 09:42.748
you're 30 minutes away
from getting it on

09:42.832 --> 09:44.541
with a 19-year-old Latin bullfighter

09:44.626 --> 09:47.419
and I pass on hot pieces of ass

09:47.504 --> 09:49.630
that throw themselves
at me all day every day

09:49.714 --> 09:52.591
without so much
as a cupping of an ass cheek.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.510
You know what? I'll tell
you, if you can get one of them

09:54.594 --> 09:57.221
to fuck you on national television,
you have my blessing.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.098
Ari, go back to work.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.892
Baby, we agreed to suffer
through monogamy together.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.103
If you love me, you won't do it!

10:04.187 --> 10:06.522
If you love me,
you will get the hell out of here.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.357
Seriously, Ari, you are pissing me off.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.025
Go back to work.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.084
- Hello?
- Anna.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.879
- Yeah, who's this?
- The guy you smashed into last night.

10:31.006 --> 10:34.633
Oh my God, I am so sorry I gave
you the wrong phone number.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.970
- Yeah, you did.
- Oh, it was a total accident.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.097
- Another one?
- Hey, um...

10:40.223 --> 10:42.224
How did you find my house?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.184
- Star Maps.
- Right.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.396
So are you, like, here to beat me up?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.815
- No.
- 'Cause you do realize

10:50.233 --> 10:52.651
it's a little nutty
tracking me down like this, right?

10:52.736 --> 10:55.070
If you didn't
look so harmless, I'd be worried.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.281
- I look harmless?
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.325
I'm in the business. I manage Vincent Chase.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.493
I'm not a crazy person.
I'm just a little pissed off.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.287
I mean, you blew off the accident.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.664
Look, if I can just get
your insurance info, that'd be great.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.167
Yeah. Okay, come in.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.710
Thank you.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.761
I swear I didn't do it on purpose.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.348
The phone is new
and I'm just totally number dyslexic.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.433
3253, 2353...

11:24.809 --> 11:26.935
My brain just can't
process the difference.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.021
Well, I'm sorry
to just show up like this.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.690
No, listen,
I'm crazy enough to do the same thing.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.193
In high school
someone put gum on my locker once

11:34.277 --> 11:36.403
and I spent three weeks
trying to track down who it was.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.571
What happened?

11:37.655 --> 11:40.115
Uh, I got my ass kicked by Jane Nevins,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.368
the 300-Ib resident school lunatic.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.828
So should we do this?

11:44.913 --> 11:47.456
- Yeah.
- Okay, here's mine.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.666
There's my stuff right there.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.378
So is your car totally screwed up?

11:52.462 --> 11:55.339
Uh, not too bad, actually. Yours?

11:55.423 --> 11:57.966
Completely.
I did something to the wheels.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.177
You know, I guess it's what I deserve.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.554
Yeah, I've been waiting
40 minutes for a cab

12:02.639 --> 12:04.473
to take me to a meeting. I am so late.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.392
I can give you a lift.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.477
Really? You'd do that?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.187
I probably should have
asked how far first.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.688
Oh no, it's really close.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.525
- No problem then.
- Okay, I'm gonna go grab my stuff.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.692
Okay.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.163
- This is nice.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.792
We don't get too much alone
time, just you and me, bro.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.127
Yeah.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.885
So what do you want to do?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.014
Well, we got no TV.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.351
- Wanna talk?
- Sure.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.608
I got nothin'.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.194
Yeah, me neither. You wanna smoke?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.904
We promised Turtle we'd wait.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.115
- I won't tell if you don't.
- Spark it up.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.535
Oh, yeah.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.920
The little bastard took it all.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.926
I was right to take it, 'cause you guys
cannot control yourselves.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.095
When are you bringing it back?
Vince is bored.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.597
I'll be home soon. Relax.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.015
You'd better not smoke any of that

13:28.099 --> 13:30.350
before you get back, Turtle.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.061
Did you hear that?
Vince feels violated.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.314
Oh, please. I would have come
home to nothing but stems

13:35.398 --> 13:37.316
if I left it with you two degenerates.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.486
Excuse me.
Hey, I only have a few things.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.112
Would you mind
if I went ahead of you?

13:42.197 --> 13:43.822
I'll call you back.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.200
Uh, sure, yeah, I'll let you go,

13:46.493 --> 13:49.036
but if your boyfriend comes running
up here with 20 more items,

13:49.120 --> 13:51.288
- I'm gonna be pissed.
- I don't have a boyfriend.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.040
Then by all means.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.583
Thanks.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.002
Healthy living.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.172
Yeah, me and my friends
are having a little midday fiesta.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.633
Hey, you know what?
Me and my friends are having one too.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.510
Maybe we should, uh, combine parties.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.678
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.514
I guarantee you
our party will be better than yours.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.098
Oh, yeah? Why?

14:10.225 --> 14:11.934
'Cause it's at Vincent Chase's house.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.268
Really?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.527
- Javier.
- Yes?

14:21.653 --> 14:23.612
Ari Gold. Do you know me?

14:24.322 --> 14:27.032
Oh, yes yes, I know of you.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.326
I'd shake your hand,
but I just used my cocoa butter.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.161
Are you interested
in representing me?

14:31.329 --> 14:33.789
I may be. I may be,

14:33.873 --> 14:35.541
but right now I'm interested

14:35.625 --> 14:37.876
in talking to you
about your scene today.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.378
Scene? I have many scenes.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.505
There's only one scene
that I wanna talk to you about.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.924
- Which one is that?
- It's the one with Mrs. Gold.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.134
- Mrs. Gold?
- Yeah, my wife.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.721
- She plays Kendall Scott.
- Oh, Kendall Scott.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.057
I'm sorry, I only
know character names.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.559
I'm a method actor.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.561
Mm, well, uh...

14:55.645 --> 14:57.896
You're supposed to
kiss her on the mouth.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.315
- Just acting.
- Don't.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.484
Mr. Gold,
the script says that I have to.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.987
Look, Javier, I can help you, okay?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.989
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life

15:07.073 --> 15:10.409
having fat middle-aged
women and odd homosexual men

15:10.493 --> 15:12.828
getting off to your work, do you?
You have bigger dreams,

15:13.037 --> 15:15.247
I'm sure, and let me tell you,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.749
as anyone in this town can tell you,

15:17.834 --> 15:19.793
I am a dream weaver, all right?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.420
So you focus on what I'm saying

15:21.504 --> 15:23.755
and I will have you
kissing Ugly Betty by Christmas,

15:23.840 --> 15:26.842
but nobody gets
to kiss my wife, nobody but me.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.386
Oh, this is nice.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.097
I can get used to having
a personal driver.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.725
Well, I might have to take the job just
to keep the roads safe...

15:34.809 --> 15:37.185
- Oh!
... with you driving, yes.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.563
You know, you did stop short.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.440
What are you talking about?
When you are the person

15:41.524 --> 15:43.692
that crashes into another person,
it's always your fault.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.068
That's common knowledge.
Everybody knows that.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.570
Yeah, I know...

15:46.654 --> 15:48.530
But you did stop short.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.991
A little bit. But still, your fault.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.993
So where am I taking you anyway?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.995
Oh, I've got this meeting
with a director

15:55.079 --> 15:57.456
- for this movie I'm gonna do.
- Oh yeah? What movie?

15:57.540 --> 15:59.458
- "Brown-Eyed Girl. "
- Okay, I've read that.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.044
They sent it over
for Vince a ways back.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.837
So what happened? You didn't like it?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.589
No, not for Vince.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.799
Do you like it for me?

16:08.384 --> 16:10.552
I mean, I don't know. I read it for Vince.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.763
Nice save.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.307
No, seriously, it was a long time ago.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.559
I don't even remember specifics.
So is this it?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.312
Yeah. Um... look, can you please

16:20.396 --> 16:22.397
be honest with me and tell me
what you thought of the script?

16:22.523 --> 16:24.274
What does it matter what I think?

16:24.359 --> 16:26.860
Well, because
now I've gotta go into this meeting

16:26.944 --> 16:28.945
and you're all in my head and...

16:29.030 --> 16:30.739
Just humor me. I can take it.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.492
Okay. All right, look, I didn't like it.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.952
I mean, if it were just
a regular romantic comedy,

16:36.037 --> 16:38.914
I'd go, "Okay, it's cute. " But it's not.
It tries to be so much more.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.832
All right?
When movies do that, I don't know,

16:40.917 --> 16:42.501
it just... It pisses me off.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.419
All right, look,
the third act... When it looks like

16:44.504 --> 16:46.004
they're gonna get back together
and all of a sudden

16:46.089 --> 16:48.924
she's taking off to start an
organic dog food company?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.967
I mean, come on.
It just felt broad and manipulative

16:51.052 --> 16:52.594
and just... I don't know, I didn't buy it.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.263
You really forgot the specifics, huh?

16:55.765 --> 16:58.684
- Was that just way too honest?
- No no no no.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.645
No, I appreciate it.
And I really appreciate the ride.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.480
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.648
So I guess our
insurance people will talk?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.025
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.734
Okay, it was nice meeting you.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.070
Nice meeting you.
Good luck on your meeting.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.864
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.829
So when do we get to smoke
some of this allegedly extinct weed?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.832
When we get back to the house.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.376
- Why can't we just smoke some now?
- 'Cause I promised my friends

17:24.460 --> 17:25.669
I wouldn't smoke it without them.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.337
That's kind of gay.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.464
I thought you were gonna bring
two friends as hot as you.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.007
Stop. She's cool.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.217
What's he saying about me up there?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.343
Nothing.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.721
- Can we at least smell it?
- You can, 'cause you're hot.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.180
Oh, eat me.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.016
Not even if you bathe yourself
in butterscotch, sweetheart.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.643
That smells good.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.645
Just pass the bowl back
and let us take one hit.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.564
Put the cap back on,
pass it up and shut up.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.857
- Turtle!
- Stop sign!

17:46.941 --> 17:49.025
Oh, shit.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.530
Oh, great great.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.948
Way to go, retard.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.335
Hello, Officer.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.005
License, registration, please.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.883
It's in here.
I'm gonna reach for it slow.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.343
What's that smell?

18:17.346 --> 18:19.264
Bring it in, bring it in. Right there.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.557
And action!

18:20.850 --> 18:23.185
- Miss Kendall.
- Come on, Julio,

18:23.686 --> 18:26.104
you can't honestly call me
that with a straight face

18:26.189 --> 18:28.106
now that you're all grown up.

18:28.191 --> 18:31.026
I'm sorry. You look amazing.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.321
Miss Kendall, you were my babysitter.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.406
You're not a baby anymore.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.534
And now that we're both adults,

18:40.161 --> 18:42.871
I thought we could
catch up like adults.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.165
- Miss Kendall...
- Julio,

18:46.209 --> 18:47.459
what would you do to me

18:47.543 --> 18:49.419
if I let you do anything

18:49.712 --> 18:52.214
and if I promised
never to tell your Uncle Juan?

18:52.507 --> 18:55.217
Julio, tell me, what would you do?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.427
I would do...

18:59.639 --> 19:00.639
This.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.224
Cut!

19:02.350 --> 19:04.059
What the fuck was that?
You're supposed to kiss her.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.645
I thought it was
a little bit more romantic.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.897
- It's not. Let's do it again.
- I'd rather not.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.774
You'd rather not what?

19:11.442 --> 19:12.859
I'd rather not kiss her.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.653
What is the problem here?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.822
I'm sorry, is it me?
Am I doing something wrong?

19:16.906 --> 19:19.491
No no no, it's not you.
You're an incredible woman.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.076
So what then?

19:21.285 --> 19:23.161
It's him.

19:25.456 --> 19:28.124
He threatened my career
and he promised me "Ugly Betty. "

19:28.209 --> 19:30.001
I will be right back.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.421
Uh, you are interfering with my work.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.506
Baby, come on.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.050
Honey, no matter what you say
or do, he's not gonna kiss you.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.969
- Oh, really?
- No, it's not gonna happen, honey.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.137
You really think that? Okay.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.652
I kissed him. It's done. Let's shoot this.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.737
Agh!

19:58.281 --> 20:01.157
You don't look like
you have glaucoma to me.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.201
- What's he saying to him?
- I don't know,

20:03.286 --> 20:05.078
but can he arrest all of us for this?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.205
I'm telling him
he kidnapped us if he tries.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.708
Officer, please.
We purchased that weed legally.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.877
- We weren't gonna smoke it.
- Son, I don't want to hear

20:11.961 --> 20:15.463
another syllable out of you
unless I ask you a question.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.925
Now it says your truck is
registered to Vincent Chase.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.304
Yeah, I'm sort of his driver.
Are you a fan?

20:22.388 --> 20:25.056
And if I throw you in jail,
who's gonna drive your movie star down

20:25.141 --> 20:27.893
- to bail you out?
- I don't know, sir, but please...

20:27.977 --> 20:29.644
- Get down on your knees!
- What?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.104
Down! Now!

20:31.731 --> 20:34.316
- Flat on your stomach!
- Are you gonna shoot me right now?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.442
No.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.656
Drop it in the sewer.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.583
Now get in your car
and get out of here.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.918
I can go?

20:53.002 --> 20:55.003
Better make it quick
before I change my mind.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.005
Thank you, Officer. Thank you.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.677
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.429
He made me
throw the weed down the sewer.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.431
Oh, bet your friends
are gonna be pissed.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.476
Can I tape your
mouth shut if you're wrong?

21:10.561 --> 21:12.562
What... What are you doing?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.399
What?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.404
I don't believe this guy.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.824
What is he doing?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.163
How?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.123
Put it on the ledge.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.126
- Wow, even I'm impressed.
- Yay!

21:40.216 --> 21:43.343
Never tell an actress
you don't like her work, E.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.845
Or an actor for that matter. It hurts.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.722
I know. I'm an idiot.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.558
Don't feel too bad.
You were never gonna get her anyway.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.560
Oh, thanks, Drama.
I feel much better now.

21:55.606 --> 21:56.731
Anna.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.818
- Hello.
- Hey, Eric, it's Anna.

21:59.902 --> 22:00.860
Hey.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.196
Listen, I felt like
we got cut off today.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.198
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

22:05.282 --> 22:07.909
Yes, sure. Sounds great.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.829
- I can take a cab or...
- No, I'll pick you up.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.706
- Great. How's 8:00?
- Perfect.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.583
- All right, cool.
- I'll see you at 8:00.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.837
Anna just asked me
to go out to dinner with her.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.046
Nice!

22:20.506 --> 22:22.424
- She asked you?
- Yeah.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.969
Make sure you pay.
End this cycle of bitchdom.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.554
I'm home.

22:27.638 --> 22:28.680
Finally.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.265
You'd better have
something good, Turtle.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.018
Looks like someone found
some fresh meat at the market.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.353
Guys, this is Laurie, Morgan...

22:35.563 --> 22:38.023
And yours, Drama. E, I didn't know
you were gonna be here,

22:38.107 --> 22:39.566
or else I would have found a fourth.

22:39.650 --> 22:40.650
You and Drama can
fight it out for her.

22:40.735 --> 22:41.776
Thanks, Turtle.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.070
Hi there. Jonathan Chase.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.697
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.240
- Hello.
- Hi.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.035
Yes!
- Yeah, try taking that

22:50.119 --> 22:52.620
and I'll break your fucking fingers.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.044
It's 8:00. What are you doing in bed?

22:59.128 --> 23:00.336
Long day. I'm relaxing.

23:00.421 --> 23:01.880
The kids eat?

23:02.339 --> 23:04.466
- I made lasagna.
- You did?

23:04.759 --> 23:07.677
It was Stouffer's,
but I did the microwaving.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.555
Look, about today...

23:10.639 --> 23:13.266
Forget today, all right?
Let's never talk about today again.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.560
It's over and I'm no longer mad...

23:15.644 --> 23:18.104
You're no longer mad?

23:18.189 --> 23:20.106
Well, I am mad, you selfish prick.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.901
- And I want an apology, Ari.
- No no no, your little Latin joyride

23:22.985 --> 23:25.153
means me never having
to say I'm sorry.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.155
- What, you're not gonna apologize?
- No, I'm not.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.531
Well, then how are we gonna
get past this?

23:28.616 --> 23:29.783
I'm already past it,

23:29.867 --> 23:31.493
unless you're gonna go
kiss another guy.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.578
- Then we're all good, all right?
- Well, I just may.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.538
They asked me to be
a series regular on the show.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.207
You're bluffing.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.374
Am I?

23:39.794 --> 23:42.003
I'm sorry, okay? I get jealous.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.215
You're possessive.
I don't want an apology for that.

23:45.299 --> 23:46.716
What... For what then?

23:46.842 --> 23:47.926
For...

23:48.844 --> 23:50.678
For telling me that I am old

23:50.763 --> 23:52.597
and that I wouldn't
photograph in high def.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.682
It's a legitimate concern.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.769
Look, I just didn't
want you doing it, all right?

23:57.853 --> 24:00.522
I like the way things are.
I don't want you on television.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.774
I don't want
some 19-year-old kissing the lips

24:02.858 --> 24:04.943
that I'm supposed
to be kissing, all right?

24:05.027 --> 24:07.737
Listen, if you wanna go
and be a soap whore every day,

24:07.822 --> 24:11.282
just do it knowing that you make
your husband miserable.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.536
You think I want to do it, Ari?

24:15.162 --> 24:17.413
I gave up acting to have a family

24:17.498 --> 24:19.916
and I have never ever regretted it.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.127
I like the way things are.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.587
I just wanted to have
one day of stupid fun.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.297
With Julio down at the schoolyard.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.633
Well, if I'm so old and ugly,
why do you even care?

24:28.717 --> 24:30.510
Well, some guys are into that.
I mean, you know...

24:30.594 --> 24:32.971
Tell me that I am sexy, Ari.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.722
Honey, you are...

24:35.057 --> 24:37.559
The beautiful mother of my children.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.896
And I respect you.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.775
Mmm, Julio.

24:45.860 --> 24:48.153
Oh, Julio.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.863
You little slut!

24:52.241 --> 24:54.159
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.620
I swear to God, my life...
I thought I was gonna die.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.664
Oh my God, you're insane.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.876
And thoroughly entertaining.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.629
Thank you so much
for coming to dinner with me.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.631
There's no arguments... It's on me.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.842
No shot. I'm paying.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.178
Oh, no no. We're gonna have to
fight it out when the bill comes.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.470
- Oh, we will.
- Okay.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.307
- So how was your meeting?
- Not good.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.559
I told you, you were in my head.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.686
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have kept my mouth shut.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.272
No no. You know what?
You were right.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.358
I reread the script and I hate it.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.152
- You serious?
- Yeah.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.154
I knew I was justifying, though.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.072
I mean, it shoots in Italy
for three months.

25:33.157 --> 25:36.367
How great would that be?
But it's just not that good.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.827
So what are you gonna do now?

25:37.912 --> 25:40.079
I told my agent to get me out of it.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.165
Oh my God, I feel terrible.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.209
- This director's gonna kill me.
- No no no no.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.962
No, you were right.
And good advice is hard to come by.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.881
- Well...
- I actually wouldn't mind

25:49.965 --> 25:51.799
picking your brain
for some more advice.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.927
Sure.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.554
Oh, I'm sorry. Hang on a second.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.389
Hey, baby. All right,

25:58.599 --> 26:00.975
I'm probably gonna be
home in, like, two hours.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.311
It's my boyfriend.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.607
- That steak was amazing.
- Yeah, what do you season it with?

26:07.691 --> 26:09.817
I'll never tell.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.111
Oh, come on. You'll tell me.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.155
No, seriously, I won't.

26:14.448 --> 26:17.742
It's unbelievable.
This shit just keeps going and going.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.161
Yeah, so stop running your mouth
and keep it going.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.247
No, I'm serious.
We've only had, like, an eighth,

26:22.331 --> 26:23.998
- and it's still...
- Actually, Turtle,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.417
I might have come across another
secret stash while I was unpacking.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.962
You're getting
sneakier and sneakier, Vin.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.464
So what now, ladies?

26:31.548 --> 26:33.466
Who's up for a little...

26:33.550 --> 26:34.926
Skinny dip?

26:35.010 --> 26:36.594
- I'm in.
- All right.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.388
- Anyone else?
- Be nice, Turtle.

26:38.472 --> 26:40.598
- I'm the only shot you got tonight.
- Pfft.

26:40.683 --> 26:43.268
- Really? I got a shot?
- No, not really.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.061
Hey, what up?
- Yo.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.438
What's up is you missed
the cable guy. That's what's up.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.399
- Oh, shit.
- Nice, Turtle.

26:49.525 --> 26:52.652
How was the big date?
- It wasn't a date. She has a boyfriend.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.988
A boyfriend?
Why did she take you out to dinner?

26:55.072 --> 26:58.074
She wanted some career advice.
She doesn't have a manager.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.159
- She wants you to be her manager?
- Yep.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.286
Whoa.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.037
I told you
you wouldn't fuck her.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.206
All right, in the pool, ladies. Let's go.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.041
Come on. Yeah, baby.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.502
Are you gonna tell me
what's on that steak?

27:09.586 --> 27:10.920
We'll see.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.215
I'll print out the recipe.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.760
She wants you to be
her manager, huh?

27:17.845 --> 27:18.928
Yeah.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.722
Interesting.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.348
Oh!

27:23.475 --> 27:25.893
Yeah, baby.
