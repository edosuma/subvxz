WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:07.089
NARRATOR:
Taurus, Leo, Gemini, Aries.

00:07.089 --> 00:10.926
Are the constellations
of the night sky merely meant

00:10.926 --> 00:12.554
to map the stars,

00:12.554 --> 00:16.265
or could they be something more?

00:16.265 --> 00:20.394
JONATHAN YOUNG:
In ancient times, there was
a fortune-telling quality

00:20.394 --> 00:22.271
to this vast array.

00:22.271 --> 00:25.358
MITCH HOROWITZ:
Our ancient ancestors
came to feel

00:25.358 --> 00:29.862
that these constellations
were windows on earthly events.

00:29.862 --> 00:34.408
ANDREW COLLINS:
Is it possible that all of these
different constellations

00:34.408 --> 00:37.119
convey alien messages inbound

00:37.119 --> 00:39.706
from somewhere else
in the galaxy?

00:39.706 --> 00:42.875
NARRATOR:
Was knowledge of
the constellations

00:42.875 --> 00:47.255
given to ancient people
by extraterrestrial visitors?

00:47.255 --> 00:50.591
And do they contain a code
that, once deciphered,

00:50.591 --> 00:54.429
could unlock the mysteries
of the entire universe?

00:54.429 --> 00:58.432
DAVID CHILDRESS:
You have to wonder
if these star signs

00:58.432 --> 01:00.393
aren't some code
that has been put there

01:00.393 --> 01:03.563
for us to make contact
with extraterrestrials.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.275
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:08.275 --> 01:11.153
in the universe.

01:11.153 --> 01:14.281
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:15.533 --> 01:18.118
It demands
we question everything

01:18.118 --> 01:20.287
we have ever been taught.

01:20.287 --> 01:23.957
The evidence is all around us.

01:23.957 --> 01:28.129
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.049
We are not alone.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.009
We have never been alone.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.686
Somerset, England.

01:45.771 --> 01:48.650
1927.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.944
49-year-old artist
Katharine Maltwood

01:51.944 --> 01:53.987
has been commissioned
to draw a map

01:53.987 --> 01:57.616
outlining the adventures
of the knights of King Arthur.

01:57.616 --> 02:01.495
Thanks to the recent invention
of the airplane,

02:01.495 --> 02:04.498
she is able to obtain
the earliest aerial photographs

02:04.498 --> 02:07.168
of the area.

02:07.168 --> 02:10.170
While studying them,
she suddenly notices

02:10.170 --> 02:13.341
a figure in the landscape.

02:13.341 --> 02:17.846
She noticed what appeared to be
a landscape lion.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.014
It just sort of reared up
at her, quite literally.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.521
And she examined this
and wondered whether

02:26.521 --> 02:31.317
this was the Leo figure
of the zodiac.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.947
Then she saw, next to it,
this large, giant figure,

02:35.947 --> 02:40.659
which she felt was part
of some kind of collective

02:40.659 --> 02:43.037
of landscape effigies

02:43.037 --> 02:45.831
that had been laid down
by ancient hands.

02:45.831 --> 02:50.670
And one by one, she found
that they actually represented

02:50.670 --> 02:53.673
the 12 signs of the zodiac.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.050
HUGH NEWMAN:
Glastonbury Zodiac is so large

02:56.050 --> 02:58.552
that you can only really see it
from the sky.

02:58.552 --> 03:03.056
The zodiac signs are marked
by rivers, streams,

03:03.056 --> 03:06.060
roads, field boundaries.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.896
Pisces is actually two fishes,

03:08.896 --> 03:12.609
and one of the fishes is
Wearyall Hill.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.568
The other side of the road,
we have Aries.

03:14.568 --> 03:18.406
They were actually creating
certain parts of the zodiac

03:18.406 --> 03:21.700
as earth works, as shapes,
deliberately.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.329
NARRATOR: The shapes look
so much like man-made features

03:25.329 --> 03:27.915
that Maltwood published
a book about them

03:27.915 --> 03:31.377
and called it
the<i> Temple of the Stars.</i>

03:31.377 --> 03:34.546
While it was received
with much skepticism,

03:34.546 --> 03:37.800
proponents say there is
ample evidence around the region

03:37.800 --> 03:40.427
to suggest these formations
have been created

03:40.427 --> 03:42.430
by artificial means

03:42.430 --> 03:45.265
and that almost every field
and hill in the area

03:45.265 --> 03:47.560
has been modified in some way.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.271
One of the most important ones
is called Ponter's Ball.

03:51.271 --> 03:56.652
Now, this is a large, mile-long,
pointed earth work,

03:56.652 --> 04:01.282
which is exactly where
the Capricorn effigy's horn is

04:01.282 --> 04:02.950
in the zodiac.

04:04.868 --> 04:07.538
NARRATOR:
Even more significant
is a massive hill

04:07.538 --> 04:09.623
called Glastonbury Tor.

04:09.623 --> 04:14.461
Many researchers are convinced
that this is a man-made feature.

04:14.461 --> 04:18.132
And based on its shape,
some have even suggested

04:18.132 --> 04:20.968
it could be hiding
an ancient pyramid.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.305
Glastonbury Tor is
the most significant part

04:25.305 --> 04:27.182
of the whole Somerset landscape.

04:27.182 --> 04:31.478
On top of it,
we have St. Michael's Tower,

04:31.478 --> 04:34.564
a 14th-century construction.

04:34.564 --> 04:39.278
But the main site itself
has terraces carved around it,

04:39.278 --> 04:41.656
like a labyrinth coming up
from ground level

04:41.656 --> 04:43.533
all the way to the top.

04:45.826 --> 04:51.290
If there really is
a labyrinthian design marked out

04:51.290 --> 04:53.293
on the slopes
of Glastonbury Tor,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.838
it's not just pre-Roman;
it must be pre-Celtic.

04:56.838 --> 05:00.257
Uh, it must even date back
to the megalithic times.

05:00.257 --> 05:01.968
WILLIAM HENRY:
The question becomes, well,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.971
if you can't see the zodiac
from ground level,

05:04.971 --> 05:07.639
then how is it possible
that these ancient designers

05:07.639 --> 05:09.391
could see it from the air?

05:09.391 --> 05:12.812
This suggests that Glastonbury
was designed with people

05:12.812 --> 05:16.231
that had some kind of
transportation that took them

05:16.231 --> 05:18.526
into the air of Glastonbury,

05:18.526 --> 05:20.569
be it an extraterrestrial craft

05:20.569 --> 05:23.822
or maybe some other type
of a craft.

05:23.822 --> 05:27.701
It's only until we ourselves
have the ability of flight

05:27.701 --> 05:30.370
and could do aerial surveys,

05:30.370 --> 05:34.750
and then we could see
this giant zodiac

05:34.750 --> 05:37.754
on the landscape
around Glastonbury.

05:37.754 --> 05:43.009
So, in some ways, perhaps it was
left for us like an ancient code

05:43.009 --> 05:45.011
to find in the future.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.889
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

05:48.889 --> 05:52.393
that to solve the mystery
of the Glastonbury Zodiac,

05:52.393 --> 05:54.937
we must first solve
another mystery:

05:54.937 --> 05:57.564
that of the zodiac itself.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.233
In ancient times,

06:00.233 --> 06:03.071
the night sky
was a dazzling mystery.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.574
This vast array of stars.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.617
And gradually,
there was an understanding

06:08.617 --> 06:11.036
that certain things
could come from this.

06:11.036 --> 06:14.206
You could read it as a calendar.

06:14.206 --> 06:16.709
You would know
when to plant your crops.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.629
You would know when
the floods might come.

06:21.588 --> 06:23.925
NARRATOR:
Connected to the tracking
of the stars

06:23.925 --> 06:26.302
was the practice
of drawing lines between them

06:26.302 --> 06:28.221
to create constellations,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.932
which exist
in the historical records

06:30.932 --> 06:34.726
of humanity's earliest
civilizations.

06:34.726 --> 06:37.605
It also appears
that these civilizations

06:37.605 --> 06:39.774
had some form
of what is referred to

06:39.774 --> 06:41.942
as the "zodiac wheel."

06:41.942 --> 06:45.612
COLLINS:
The ancients decided
that they would

06:45.612 --> 06:48.615
create a division of the heavens

06:48.615 --> 06:52.120
based upon the movement
of the Sun

06:52.120 --> 06:54.622
through one yearly cycle.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.250
And as it does this,
it passes through

06:57.250 --> 07:00.002
12 different constellations.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.963
And these become
the zodiacal signs

07:02.963 --> 07:04.966
that we know today.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.136
These ideas go back
to Babylonian times

07:08.136 --> 07:11.805
and even the Sumerians,
as much as 5,000 years ago.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.185
NARRATOR:
In many ancient cultures,
it was thought

07:17.185 --> 07:20.856
that the constellations affected
not only harvests and weather,

07:20.856 --> 07:23.151
but daily life as well.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.819
While this may seem like
a primitive notion,

07:25.819 --> 07:28.822
it is very much alive and well,

07:28.822 --> 07:31.117
kept relevant
by billions of people

07:31.117 --> 07:34.036
who check their horoscopes
every day.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.665
In modern times, there's this
distinction between astronomy,

07:37.665 --> 07:39.875
which is the observation
of celestial movements,

07:39.875 --> 07:43.170
and astrology,
which is the interpretation

07:43.170 --> 07:46.007
of those celestial bodies
and movements.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.800
In ancient times,
the astronomers and astrologers

07:48.800 --> 07:51.846
tended to be one
and the same person.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.182
Astrology didn't originate
in one place,

07:54.182 --> 07:56.141
but for some reason,
just about every culture

07:56.141 --> 07:58.310
seems to have made
this observation

07:58.310 --> 08:00.687
that there's a correlation
between celestial movements

08:00.687 --> 08:02.064
and earthly events,

08:02.064 --> 08:04.817
which is the basic premise
of astrology.

08:04.817 --> 08:08.487
NARRATOR:
While astrology is dismissed
by modern science,

08:08.487 --> 08:11.615
it is estimated
that over 90% of the world's

08:11.615 --> 08:16.370
adult population today is aware
of their astrological sign.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.831
In the modern world,
many people regard this

08:19.831 --> 08:23.211
as nothing more than
a topic of conversation.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.713
But in the ancient world,
the zodiac wheel was seen

08:26.713 --> 08:29.884
as a way to communicate
with the gods.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.302
The ancient Greeks
conceptualized astrology

08:32.302 --> 08:35.389
as the language of the gods,
or the heavenly script,

08:35.389 --> 08:38.100
as if the movements
of the planets across the sky

08:38.100 --> 08:41.229
and through the signs of
the zodiac or the constellations

08:41.229 --> 08:43.230
had some sort
of significant message

08:43.230 --> 08:45.232
that was being conveyed
by the gods

08:45.232 --> 08:49.070
about life on Earth
and about individuals.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.572
NARRATOR:
The ancient people
associated the constellations

08:52.572 --> 08:56.744
with important historical
and mythological events,

08:56.744 --> 09:00.248
and even with the creation
of humanity itself.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.583
HENRY:
The ancients began assigning
animals as symbols

09:03.583 --> 09:06.836
for this journey
through the sky.

09:06.836 --> 09:09.840
In ancient Sumeria,
they identified Aquarius

09:09.840 --> 09:12.259
with a god being, Enki,

09:12.259 --> 09:15.596
who was the creator god
in the Sumerian tradition.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.015
According to the Sumerians,
it was Enki who came to Earth

09:19.015 --> 09:22.061
and created humanity
in its present form.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.772
Now, this is very interesting,

09:24.772 --> 09:26.774
because these types
of descriptions appear

09:26.774 --> 09:29.317
over and over again
where people connect

09:29.317 --> 09:32.196
with these particular
star systems or constellations,

09:32.196 --> 09:37.076
in various mythic
and historical traditions.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.287
That cannot be by coincidence.

09:41.288 --> 09:44.125
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that
extraterrestrial visitors

09:44.125 --> 09:47.043
are responsible
for so many separate cultures

09:47.043 --> 09:49.797
not only connecting
the same groups of stars

09:49.797 --> 09:51.591
in the exact same way,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.634
but for revering
these constellations

09:53.634 --> 09:56.596
as sources of power and wisdom?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.681
Could these pictures in the sky

09:58.681 --> 10:00.850
have a far more profound
significance

10:00.850 --> 10:03.184
than we are aware of today?

10:03.184 --> 10:07.440
And if so, might the Glastonbury
Zodiac provide the key

10:07.440 --> 10:10.650
to recovering
this lost knowledge?

10:10.650 --> 10:13.821
Curiously,
Glastonbury has been a hotbed

10:13.821 --> 10:16.948
of UFO sightings for decades.

10:16.948 --> 10:18.826
One of the most famous
encounters

10:18.826 --> 10:24.289
was reported by author Anthony
Roberts and his wife in 1969.

10:25.332 --> 10:27.335
And they were driving in a car,

10:27.335 --> 10:30.004
and they'd seen a huge sphere

10:30.004 --> 10:32.005
of white light
in the sky ahead of them,

10:32.005 --> 10:35.634
and they followed it
and it changed size.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.470
It then started to trace out

10:37.470 --> 10:41.807
an enormous geometrical star
pattern across the entire sky,

10:41.807 --> 10:45.226
and then massively accelerate
and disappear.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.856
NARRATOR:
Might there be a connection
between the star pattern

10:49.856 --> 10:52.692
that was allegedly created
by the UFO

10:52.692 --> 10:57.030
and the zodiac wheel formed
in the Glastonbury landscape?

10:57.030 --> 11:00.493
But if this site really does
contain lost knowledge

11:00.493 --> 11:03.995
regarding the zodiac,
what could it be?

11:03.995 --> 11:07.207
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

11:07.207 --> 11:09.376
another towering megalithic site

11:09.376 --> 11:12.587
built in the shape
of a constellation.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.721
NARRATOR:
Alatri, Italy,

11:20.721 --> 11:23.432
June 2019.

11:26.309 --> 11:29.397
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

11:29.397 --> 11:32.232
is in the heart
of the Italian peninsula,

11:32.232 --> 11:35.152
about 50 miles southeast
of Rome.

11:35.152 --> 11:39.030
He is here to investigate
the astronomical alignment

11:39.030 --> 11:41.741
of the finest megalithic
construction in Italy,

11:41.741 --> 11:43.952
the city's acropolis.

11:43.952 --> 11:45.453
TSOUKALOS (chuckles):
All right.

11:45.453 --> 11:47.539
Giulio.

11:47.539 --> 11:49.040
-Hello, Giorgio. How are you?
-Good to see you again.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.418
-Yeah. Nice to see you again.
-How are you?

11:50.418 --> 11:52.043
-Fine.
-What a fantastic place.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.173
-I cannot wait
to see all of this.
-Yeah. Yeah.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.467
-Yeah.
-I've been waiting
for years to see this.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.261
Amazing.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.889
NARRATOR:
For expert insight,
he has enlisted the help

12:03.889 --> 12:08.226
of Dr. Giulio Magli,
a professor of archaeoastronomy

12:08.226 --> 12:11.730
from the Polytechnic University
in Milan, Italy.

12:11.730 --> 12:17.610
Dr. Magli has spent years
studying this massive structure.

12:17.610 --> 12:18.946
This is incredible.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.034
Mm-hmm.

12:37.755 --> 12:41.509
TSOUKALOS:
26 tons. I mean, this is
absolutely insane.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.397
Right.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.486
So you're suggesting
that they had to have had

12:59.486 --> 13:02.364
a compelling reason to do this,

13:02.364 --> 13:04.616
'cause nobody
in their right mind

13:04.616 --> 13:07.577
would do something like this
without a reason.

13:07.577 --> 13:09.413
Yes.

13:09.413 --> 13:12.416
NARRATOR:
The imposing megalithic citadel

13:12.416 --> 13:14.751
was built on top of a hill

13:14.751 --> 13:18.505
and is defined
by six huge walls.

13:18.505 --> 13:21.759
The shape of the acropolis,
when viewed from the sky,

13:21.759 --> 13:24.595
has led some to suggest
that it was built to create

13:24.595 --> 13:29.475
a lasting commemoration of the
site's connection to the stars.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.809
Giorgio has brought
a drone with him

13:31.809 --> 13:35.188
to get an aerial view
of the ancient acropolis.

13:35.188 --> 13:37.942
-All right,
let's launch this rocket.
-Yes.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.825
TSOUKALOS:
All right, so what
do we see here?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.126
-Okay.
-And...

14:04.384 --> 14:05.635
TSOUKALOS:
Right.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.975
So, are you saying that this
mount here was cut artificially?

14:13.059 --> 14:14.852
That is incredible.

14:15.895 --> 14:17.105
TSOUKALOS:
Yeah.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.359
Mm-hmm.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.960
TSOUKALOS:
So, we are looking
at the outline of Gemini here?

14:39.503 --> 14:41.504
-Wow.
-May well be.

14:41.504 --> 14:45.884
What's really interesting here
is that the entire mountaintop

14:45.884 --> 14:47.760
has been artificially shaped

14:47.760 --> 14:51.639
so that it is in the shape
of the constellation of Gemini.

14:51.639 --> 14:56.437
And then you have to wonder,
why was it built in this shape?

14:56.437 --> 14:59.815
Because something
of significance happened here

14:59.815 --> 15:01.692
a long time ago.

15:02.942 --> 15:04.903
NARRATOR:
In Greek mythology,

15:04.903 --> 15:08.240
the Gemini constellation
depicts twin brothers,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.241
Castor and Pollux,

15:10.241 --> 15:13.077
the offspring
of a god and a human.

15:13.077 --> 15:16.456
HENRY: In the story, we're told
that Zeus shape-shifted

15:16.456 --> 15:19.585
or disguised himself as a swan

15:19.585 --> 15:22.587
and impregnated
this human female, Leda,

15:22.587 --> 15:26.424
leading to the birth
of Castor and Pollux.

15:26.424 --> 15:28.427
But in some versions
of the story,

15:28.427 --> 15:29.927
we learn that there were
actually

15:29.927 --> 15:31.471
two eggs that were hatched.

15:31.471 --> 15:33.432
One had the twin sets of boys,

15:33.432 --> 15:35.808
and another had
twin sets of girls.

15:35.808 --> 15:37.436
Some of the twins were mortal.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.562
Others of the twins
were immortal.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.649
NARRATOR:
While mainstream historians

15:42.649 --> 15:45.568
consider the story
purely mythological,

15:45.568 --> 15:48.780
ancient astronaut theorists
point out that these gods

15:48.780 --> 15:52.868
were considered very real
by the Greek people of the time,

15:52.868 --> 15:55.703
and they propose
that the story of the twins

15:55.703 --> 15:59.457
could be an account of
an extraterrestrial encounter.

15:59.457 --> 16:02.001
In one version of the story,
we're told that

16:02.001 --> 16:04.171
the egg containing
Castor and Pollux

16:04.171 --> 16:07.298
came down out of the heavens.

16:07.298 --> 16:11.636
TSOUKALOS:
When the legends say that the
Gemini twins were born of an egg

16:11.636 --> 16:13.971
that descended from the sky,

16:13.971 --> 16:18.811
it actually says that they were
born of a so-called cosmic egg.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.604
And what are these cosmic eggs?

16:22.022 --> 16:24.607
They're always described

16:24.607 --> 16:29.196
as having either a silver
or a bronze-colored shell,

16:29.196 --> 16:31.407
and sometimes
they're also described

16:31.407 --> 16:35.369
as having a lot
of smoke, fire and noise.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.037
CHILDRESS:
And interestingly,

16:37.037 --> 16:41.750
many UFOs are sometimes
seen as eggs.

16:41.750 --> 16:46.422
So, is it possible that the egg
of Castor and Pollux

16:46.422 --> 16:50.884
is some extraterrestrial vehicle
that looks like an egg

16:50.884 --> 16:56.056
and lands on Earth,
and then two twins step out?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.640
It's quite possible.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.018
NARRATOR:
If the Alatri acropolis

17:00.018 --> 17:03.522
was purposely built to resemble
the Gemini constellation,

17:03.522 --> 17:06.900
could it be commemorating
an alien visitation?

17:06.900 --> 17:09.028
And considering
the incredible size

17:09.028 --> 17:12.071
of the stones it was built with,
is it possible

17:12.071 --> 17:15.032
that the extraterrestrials
themselves had a hand

17:15.032 --> 17:17.368
in the wall's construction?

17:17.368 --> 17:21.123
Do we have any records,
written records at all,

17:21.123 --> 17:23.834
-about this place
from ancient times?
-We don't.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.924
Okay.

17:31.924 --> 17:33.801
What is your speculation

17:33.801 --> 17:36.930
how old this place
really could be?

17:36.930 --> 17:37.972
Okay, uh...

17:56.784 --> 17:58.576
TSOUKALOS:
Because you can clearly see

17:58.576 --> 18:00.496
the different
construction styles.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.664
Giulio, thank you very much
for sharing this with me,

18:03.664 --> 18:07.126
and I can't wait till
we see each other again.

18:07.126 --> 18:10.463
CHILDRESS:
Whoever built
the Alatri acropolis

18:10.463 --> 18:12.965
was trying to point
something out to us.

18:12.965 --> 18:16.303
Apparently, they were trying
to show us the zodiac

18:16.303 --> 18:18.806
and the constellation of Gemini.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.643
And why they were trying
to do that, we don't know.

18:22.643 --> 18:27.105
NARRATOR:
The Alatri acropolis
is particularly baffling

18:27.105 --> 18:29.650
in that, much like
the Glastonbury Zodiac,

18:29.650 --> 18:32.986
its shape can only be discerned
from high above,

18:32.986 --> 18:35.279
a perspective
that the ancient people

18:35.279 --> 18:37.825
presumably would not have had.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.993
But these are just two
of many sites found

18:40.993 --> 18:43.830
all over the world
that appear to have connections

18:43.830 --> 18:45.665
to the stars.

18:45.665 --> 18:49.545
HENRY:
The Mayan temples were aligned
with the Pleiades.

18:49.545 --> 18:53.423
Angkor Wat is aligned with
the constellation of Draco.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.843
What's interesting about
all of these places

18:55.843 --> 18:58.761
is that they're considered
to be star mirrors,

18:58.761 --> 19:01.013
making them places
of connection,

19:01.013 --> 19:02.682
where people can go to connect

19:02.682 --> 19:05.560
with that particular star system
or constellation.

19:06.769 --> 19:08.188
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

19:08.188 --> 19:10.648
that the Alatri acropolis
and other sites

19:10.648 --> 19:13.192
aligned with constellations
around the world

19:13.192 --> 19:15.863
were built to honor
extraterrestrial beings

19:15.863 --> 19:18.240
who visited in the distant past?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.992
And if so,
could they have another,

19:20.992 --> 19:23.077
even more profound purpose?

19:24.704 --> 19:27.374
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

19:27.374 --> 19:30.711
and suggest further clues
as to what that purpose is

19:30.711 --> 19:34.506
can be found by examining
the signs of the zodiac

19:34.506 --> 19:37.092
and their connection
to the gods.

19:42.597 --> 19:43.891
NARRATOR:
Berlin, Germany.

19:46.058 --> 19:49.061
January 2016.

19:49.061 --> 19:50.730
(bicycle bell dinging)

19:50.730 --> 19:53.942
Humboldt University professor
Mathieu Ossendrijver

19:53.942 --> 19:56.236
announces
a revolutionary discovery

19:56.236 --> 19:58.029
in the field of astronomy.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.782
He translates a Babylonian text

20:01.782 --> 20:04.869
that shows the ancient people
calculated the orbit of Jupiter

20:04.869 --> 20:08.080
more than 2,000 years ago,

20:08.080 --> 20:11.084
demonstrating an understanding
of mathematical concepts

20:11.084 --> 20:13.295
that were not thought
to have been developed

20:13.295 --> 20:15.338
until the 17th century.

20:18.299 --> 20:21.094
The sky watchers of Babylon
also identified

20:21.094 --> 20:23.387
the constellations
of the zodiac.

20:23.387 --> 20:26.057
And incredibly, a star chart

20:26.057 --> 20:28.059
belonging to
the Sumerian civilization

20:28.059 --> 20:29.728
that preceded the Babylonians

20:29.728 --> 20:32.480
has been dated to 3300 BC.

20:34.607 --> 20:36.734
But perhaps
even more significant

20:36.734 --> 20:38.778
than the discovery
that ancient people

20:38.778 --> 20:42.950
recognized the constellations
as early as 5,000 years ago

20:42.950 --> 20:44.867
is the fact
that they believed them

20:44.867 --> 20:47.287
to be intimately tied
to events on Earth,

20:47.287 --> 20:50.082
imbued with the power
of the gods.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.919
Each sign has its own story.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.880
Each is tied
to specific mythology.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.298
Different mythologies
in different parts of the world,

20:59.298 --> 21:03.345
but the collection
has sort of become standardized,

21:03.345 --> 21:06.556
more or less based on the Greek,
with a few exceptions.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.433
So, the sign Aries
is represented

21:09.433 --> 21:12.311
by the god Aries,
the god of war.

21:12.311 --> 21:14.981
This is not only
the warrior energy,

21:14.981 --> 21:18.609
but the ability to fight through
a difficult problem.

21:18.609 --> 21:21.529
Taurus is the god Aphrodite,

21:21.529 --> 21:23.824
and this is
important divine energy,

21:23.824 --> 21:25.866
it is love, beauty, sex,

21:25.866 --> 21:28.286
a sense of confidence
in your appearance.

21:28.286 --> 21:31.832
Cancer is associated with
the goddess Artemis,

21:31.832 --> 21:34.960
the goddess of the hunt,
of the forest and the Moon,

21:34.960 --> 21:37.170
so the dark places
that are important

21:37.170 --> 21:39.047
but hard to navigate.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.675
So we have these 12 stories,
these 12 signs,

21:42.675 --> 21:45.679
12 different divine energies.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.848
The very first
personality typology

21:48.848 --> 21:51.684
is born of our relationship
with the sky.

21:51.684 --> 21:53.103
It's born of the stars.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.021
We're looking out into
the celestial realm,

21:55.021 --> 21:56.690
and we see ourselves.

21:56.690 --> 22:00.527
NARRATOR:
In many ways,
the zodiac truly is

22:00.527 --> 22:02.612
the language of the heavens.

22:02.612 --> 22:06.157
The positions of the
constellations in the night sky

22:06.157 --> 22:08.868
also indicate the positions
of the planets,

22:08.868 --> 22:11.203
as well as the position
of the Earth

22:11.203 --> 22:13.330
in relation to the Sun.

22:13.330 --> 22:17.001
Incredibly, ancient people
had some understanding of this

22:17.001 --> 22:20.881
thousands of years before
the invention of the telescope.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.923
And they closely watched
the movement

22:22.923 --> 22:25.844
of these celestial bodies
for divine messages.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.721
This shows up really prominently
in the Bible.

22:28.721 --> 22:32.058
Uh, for example, in the story
of-- or the Gospel of Matthew--

22:32.058 --> 22:37.189
there's the story about the Magi
going to the birth of Jesus

22:37.189 --> 22:39.900
because they saw
the Star of Bethlehem.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.903
But the point of that story
is not that the Magi

22:42.903 --> 22:45.614
saw the Star of Bethlehem
and thought it caused the birth

22:45.614 --> 22:47.531
of Jesus, but just that
there was some sort

22:47.531 --> 22:50.076
of celestial omen or message
that indicated

22:50.076 --> 22:52.453
that somebody important
had been born.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.875
And that's part of the reason
why some of the planets

22:56.875 --> 22:59.044
are named after specific gods.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.297
Like Jupiter-- in Greek--
is named Zeus,

23:02.297 --> 23:06.343
or Mercury was named Hermes,
and so on and so forth.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.261
They tended to think
that the planets

23:09.261 --> 23:10.763
and some of the celestial bodies

23:10.763 --> 23:13.642
were the celestial
representations of those gods

23:13.642 --> 23:17.394
and had some power to convey
messages from the cosmos,

23:17.394 --> 23:20.606
as if the cosmos itself
was alive and sentient

23:20.606 --> 23:23.734
and capable of speaking
to humanity.

23:23.734 --> 23:28.405
And sometimes they'll go so far
as to try to, um, mirror events

23:28.405 --> 23:30.741
that are happening
in the sky on Earth.

23:30.741 --> 23:33.077
NARRATOR:
If ancient people believed

23:33.077 --> 23:36.832
that the stars relayed messages
from the gods to humans,

23:36.832 --> 23:40.042
then did they build structures
aligned to the stars

23:40.042 --> 23:41.961
or in the shape
of constellations

23:41.961 --> 23:45.798
not simply to pay tribute
to these gods,

23:45.798 --> 23:48.384
but to leave messages
of their own?

23:50.636 --> 23:52.931
Perhaps further clues
can be found

23:52.931 --> 23:55.432
by examining
a more modern mystery.

23:56.809 --> 24:00.730
In 2018, astrophysicist
Travis Taylor

24:00.730 --> 24:02.773
traveled to Oak Island,

24:02.773 --> 24:04.733
off the coast
of Nova Scotia, Canada,

24:04.733 --> 24:07.653
where, according to legend,
a treasure was buried

24:07.653 --> 24:10.156
more than 200 years ago.

24:10.156 --> 24:12.491
Travis met up with the island's
current caretakers,

24:12.491 --> 24:14.827
Rick and Marty Lagina,

24:14.827 --> 24:17.998
to test his theory
that a band of warrior monks

24:17.998 --> 24:21.334
called the Knights Templar
was behind the mystery,

24:21.334 --> 24:23.545
and that they recorded
the location of the treasure

24:23.545 --> 24:25.630
with a star map.

24:27.298 --> 24:29.509
MARTY LAGINA: So, you've done
some investigative work

24:29.509 --> 24:32.136
-and you have some stuff
to show us, I understand.
-TAYLOR: Right. Yeah, I do.

24:32.136 --> 24:33.971
I got to thinking,
is there something

24:33.971 --> 24:36.223
that archaeoastronomy might
have to do with the island?

24:37.808 --> 24:42.021
So I overlaid the constellation
of Taurus on the island.

24:44.648 --> 24:47.527
What we have
are all of the stars

24:47.527 --> 24:49.988
aligning onto the island.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.240
This is a star map.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.659
Not only are the stars
used for navigation;

24:54.659 --> 24:57.119
you can look at
the constellations in the sky

24:57.119 --> 25:01.208
and also use those to map out
points on the ground,

25:01.208 --> 25:05.045
and that can also act
as like a treasure map.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.839
There's a huge boulder
over here.

25:08.839 --> 25:12.219
We walked across the island
to those GPS coordinates,

25:12.219 --> 25:13.845
and interestingly enough,

25:13.845 --> 25:16.722
six out of seven of the points
we went to...

25:16.722 --> 25:19.726
Is that not a giant stone
right there?

25:19.726 --> 25:23.520
...there was a large boulder,
uh, that weighed several tons,

25:23.520 --> 25:26.857
that was right where
the star coincided

25:26.857 --> 25:28.734
with the map on the island.

25:28.734 --> 25:30.069
JACK BEGLEY:
This is one of your points,

25:30.069 --> 25:32.072
and there was
a stone feature here.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.405
-A very obvious one.
-That's-that's wild.

25:34.865 --> 25:36.076
TAYLOR:
The boulders,

25:36.076 --> 25:37.743
they weren't indigenously there.

25:37.743 --> 25:39.496
They were put there on purpose.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.748
So, the constellation
was drawn out on the island.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.625
The question is, why?

25:43.625 --> 25:45.460
LAGINA:
Yeah, you can't deny
that you're hitting

25:45.460 --> 25:47.295
on all cylinders,
so that's cool.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.922
On to the next.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.923
Could those stones that we saw

25:50.923 --> 25:53.884
be markers that were put there
by some human beings

25:53.884 --> 25:56.762
a long, long time ago
to correspond with a star map?

25:56.762 --> 25:58.807
The answer is--
of course they could.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.977
NARRATOR:
While the Oak Island treasure
has yet to be found,

26:01.977 --> 26:04.938
many experts believe
that constellations

26:04.938 --> 26:07.898
can be used as a type of code.

26:07.898 --> 26:10.609
It's possible that other
information could also be used,

26:10.609 --> 26:13.613
uh, by laying star maps
on the surface.

26:13.613 --> 26:17.616
They could be leaving a message,
like, whoever built this,

26:17.616 --> 26:19.786
that's where they came from.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.955
It's also possible
that this could be a message

26:22.955 --> 26:25.291
on how to build or do something.

26:25.291 --> 26:28.461
NARRATOR:
Messages contained in star maps?

26:28.461 --> 26:31.088
Could this explain
not only the arrangement

26:31.088 --> 26:33.633
of the mysterious boulders
found on Oak Island,

26:33.633 --> 26:36.302
but also why ancient peoples
throughout the world

26:36.302 --> 26:39.306
built structures
to mirror the heavens?

26:39.306 --> 26:43.934
But if so, what information
might be revealed at places

26:43.934 --> 26:47.814
like the Alatri acropolis
and the Glastonbury pyramid?

26:47.814 --> 26:49.816
Are they pointing to the origins

26:49.816 --> 26:53.819
of multiple extraterrestrial
factions that came to Earth?

26:53.819 --> 26:57.449
Or something even more profound?

27:01.161 --> 27:03.872
NARRATOR:
St. Andrews, Scotland.

27:03.872 --> 27:07.541
July 2012.

27:07.541 --> 27:11.211
A team of scientists
at St. Andrews University

27:11.211 --> 27:13.631
announces
an incredible discovery,

27:13.631 --> 27:17.594
the remains of an ancient
civilization on the bottom

27:17.594 --> 27:21.431
of the North Sea,
just east of the British Isles.

27:21.431 --> 27:26.353
Archaeologists believe it fell
victim to rising sea levels

27:26.353 --> 27:31.398
at least 8,000 years ago,
and potentially even earlier.

27:31.398 --> 27:35.194
The sunken civilization
is named Doggerland

27:35.194 --> 27:38.448
after a nearby sandbank
called Dogger Bank,

27:38.448 --> 27:43.869
but there are some who call it
by another name: Atlantis.

27:43.869 --> 27:45.954
TSOUKALOS: The first reference
of Atlantis that we have

27:45.954 --> 27:51.461
is in Plato's dialogues
by Timaeus and Critias.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.587
In the very end of that,

27:53.587 --> 27:57.049
it talks about this
mythical place called Atlantis

27:57.049 --> 28:01.221
from where any and all knowledge
of the world came.

28:01.221 --> 28:04.432
And so,
some people have suggested

28:04.432 --> 28:09.686
that the first civilization on
Earth may have been Atlantean.

28:09.686 --> 28:11.689
Depending on
your source material,

28:11.689 --> 28:14.150
Atlantis will be depicted
in different ways,

28:14.150 --> 28:17.737
but from Plato forward,
it's almost always depicted

28:17.737 --> 28:21.825
as a technologically advanced
civilization.

28:21.825 --> 28:26.829
A civilization that occupies
the pinnacle of development.

28:26.829 --> 28:31.334
Atlantis was allegedly
this land mass that existed

28:31.334 --> 28:34.378
beyond the Pillars of Hercules,

28:34.378 --> 28:36.713
which is today's
Strait of Gibraltar,

28:36.713 --> 28:39.717
and to this day,
if Atlantis existed,

28:39.717 --> 28:42.846
we have no idea
where exactly Atlantis was.

28:44.263 --> 28:45.932
NARRATOR:
According to legend,

28:45.932 --> 28:49.269
Atlantis was destroyed
by a cataclysmic flood,

28:49.269 --> 28:53.605
which some identify as the great
flood described in the Bible.

28:56.442 --> 28:59.278
Is it possible that
the newly discovered Doggerland

28:59.278 --> 29:01.321
is actually Atlantis?

29:01.321 --> 29:04.491
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

29:04.491 --> 29:08.203
and suggest that not only can
evidence of the lost city

29:08.203 --> 29:12.834
be found underwater,
but even survives on dry land,

29:12.834 --> 29:15.586
hiding in plain sight.

29:15.586 --> 29:20.884
A number of modern scholars
in England, particularly,

29:20.884 --> 29:25.721
have believed that all of
the stone structures and mounds

29:25.721 --> 29:29.893
that are in England and Wales
and Scotland and Ireland

29:29.893 --> 29:33.229
are all remnants of Atlantis.

29:33.229 --> 29:36.982
The famous researcher
John Michell in England

29:36.982 --> 29:40.487
wrote a book called
<i> The View Over Atlantis.</i>

29:40.487 --> 29:43.198
And in that book,
he's talking about

29:43.198 --> 29:46.742
the remnants of Atlantis
that is still above water

29:46.742 --> 29:49.871
while much of Atlantis
is underwater now.

29:49.871 --> 29:54.666
NARRATOR:
In 1960, British author
Brinsley Le Poer Trench

29:54.666 --> 29:57.836
published his seminal book,
<i> The Sky People.</i>

29:57.836 --> 30:03.468
In it, he claims the Glastonbury
Zodiac was built by Atlanteans.

30:03.468 --> 30:07.346
Atlantis was basically
a culture that always,

30:07.346 --> 30:10.432
as far as Trench was concerned,
from the very beginning,

30:10.432 --> 30:12.894
uh, had an E.T. impetus.

30:12.894 --> 30:17.440
And at its very end,
that impetus is there again

30:17.440 --> 30:20.317
when the Glastonbury Zodiac
is created

30:20.317 --> 30:26.365
as an enduring memorial
and also as a future prophecy

30:26.365 --> 30:30.077
by Atlantean refugees,
if you like,

30:30.077 --> 30:32.121
with help from the sky people.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.582
HENRY:
In esoteric British lore,

30:34.582 --> 30:37.751
before the fall of Atlantis,
there were refugees, sages,

30:37.751 --> 30:40.046
that came to the British Isles

30:40.046 --> 30:42.214
and created
the Glastonbury Zodiac

30:42.214 --> 30:45.676
as a way to remember
the story of Atlantis.

30:47.302 --> 30:49.388
NARRATOR:
Could it be that an advanced

30:49.388 --> 30:51.598
ancient civilization
called Atlantis

30:51.598 --> 30:54.894
was not only real,
but was a place where humans

30:54.894 --> 30:57.646
coexisted
with extraterrestrials?

30:57.646 --> 31:00.983
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest further clues

31:00.983 --> 31:04.319
can be found by examining
the Greek creation myth

31:04.319 --> 31:06.990
of the lost continent.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.825
CHILDRESS:
According to legend,

31:08.825 --> 31:12.953
Atlantis was founded
by the god Poseidon.

31:12.953 --> 31:18.417
He fell in love
with a human woman named Cleito,

31:18.417 --> 31:21.921
and that they had
five sets of twins.

31:21.921 --> 31:27.259
And these twins went on
to be the founders of Atlantis.

31:27.259 --> 31:31.847
So here we see, really, a story
of extraterrestrials, perhaps,

31:31.847 --> 31:35.684
coming to Earth
at a very early date.

31:35.684 --> 31:38.229
Before the last ice age.

31:39.980 --> 31:42.275
NARRATOR:
The mythology of
the ancient Celtic people

31:42.275 --> 31:45.528
also tells of a race of beings
who came from the sky

31:45.528 --> 31:49.740
in this part of the world:
the Tuath Dé Danann.

31:49.740 --> 31:51.326
HENRY:
When we look at the story

31:51.326 --> 31:53.161
of the origins of the druids

31:53.161 --> 31:56.497
and how they are the offspring
of the Tuath Dé Danann,

31:56.497 --> 31:59.041
who came from the stars
and came...

31:59.041 --> 32:02.170
rode upon clouds
and-and came to Britain,

32:02.170 --> 32:05.298
we wonder if these, in fact,
could be the same gods

32:05.298 --> 32:09.301
that founded
the civilization of Atlantis.

32:09.301 --> 32:12.471
NARRATOR:
Could it be that
the Glastonbury Zodiac

32:12.471 --> 32:14.641
was created by Atlanteans?

32:14.641 --> 32:17.894
But if so, why?

32:17.894 --> 32:21.314
Was it meant to leave a physical
record of a civilization

32:21.314 --> 32:23.857
on the verge of annihilation?

32:23.857 --> 32:26.568
Or does it contain
critical information

32:26.568 --> 32:29.821
for the evolution of humankind?

32:36.078 --> 32:37.579
NARRATOR:
Glastonbury, England.

32:37.579 --> 32:40.083
1983.

32:42.335 --> 32:45.171
While researching
the Glastonbury Zodiac,

32:45.171 --> 32:48.508
author Andrew Collins hears
numerous accounts from people

32:48.508 --> 32:50.509
claiming to have experienced
strange visions

32:50.509 --> 32:53.261
associated with the site.

32:53.261 --> 32:58.393
For Collins, this aspect of the
mystery resonates most deeply,

32:58.393 --> 33:02.563
as he has experienced
such visions himself.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.607
One of the purposes
of the Glastonbury Zodiac

33:05.607 --> 33:08.111
would seem to draw people
towards it.

33:09.528 --> 33:12.030
During an earlier part
of my life,

33:12.030 --> 33:15.785
I was drawn into
the Glastonbury Zodiac quest.

33:15.785 --> 33:19.622
I started to receive
dreams and visions,

33:19.622 --> 33:23.750
and I felt that I had to embark
upon this quest

33:23.750 --> 33:27.713
to navigate
from each different sign,

33:27.713 --> 33:30.215
going from place to place.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.261
And the sense is,
at the end of it,

33:34.261 --> 33:35.930
is that you're contributing

33:35.930 --> 33:38.807
to some kind
of global consciousness.

33:38.807 --> 33:40.934
For, in my opinion,

33:40.934 --> 33:44.730
some kind of intelligence
is responsible

33:44.730 --> 33:48.817
for drawing human experience,
human knowledge,

33:48.817 --> 33:51.570
and uploading this
into the system.

33:51.570 --> 33:55.700
NARRATOR:
Profound visions have been
reported at Glastonbury

33:55.700 --> 33:58.952
dating all the way back
to the modern-day rediscovery

33:58.952 --> 34:03.039
of the enormous landscape zodiac
in 1927.

34:03.039 --> 34:06.251
When Katharine Maltwood
first noticed the constellations

34:06.251 --> 34:09.797
in the landscape, she said that
they jumped out at her

34:09.797 --> 34:12.425
as if in a flash of inspiration.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.594
HENRY:
Maltwood's sudden discovery

34:14.594 --> 34:17.221
of the Glastonbury Zodiac
is very interesting

34:17.221 --> 34:19.181
because it makes you wonder,

34:19.181 --> 34:21.601
was she herself in an
altered state of consciousness

34:21.601 --> 34:23.936
when she had this
flash of inspiration?

34:23.936 --> 34:25.730
Did she receive perhaps
a message

34:25.730 --> 34:29.025
from an otherworldly,
even extraterrestrial being

34:29.025 --> 34:32.612
who told her what is actually
on the landscape at Glastonbury?

34:34.112 --> 34:36.199
NARRATOR:
In his book,<i> The Sky People,</i>

34:36.199 --> 34:39.619
Brinsley Le Poer Trench
pointed out a curious detail

34:39.619 --> 34:43.289
of the Glastonbury Zodiac
that he felt provided evidence

34:43.289 --> 34:46.000
of an extraterrestrial
connection.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.795
Trench had the idea that because

34:48.795 --> 34:51.505
there is just one
of the twins of Gemini

34:51.505 --> 34:55.092
depicted in
the Glastonbury Zodiac,

34:55.092 --> 34:59.054
the other twin
is in outer space.

34:59.054 --> 35:03.934
It is a whole testimony
to this tearing asunder

35:03.934 --> 35:07.521
of our family by the great
tragic, uh, event

35:07.521 --> 35:09.315
of the fall of Atlantis.

35:09.315 --> 35:12.693
HENRY:
Maltwood believed
that the Glastonbury Zodiac

35:12.693 --> 35:14.445
is an earthly counterpart

35:14.445 --> 35:18.324
to the stellar temple called
the Caer Sidi of the Celts

35:18.324 --> 35:20.742
and that, in fact,
it was a mirror

35:20.742 --> 35:22.954
of the zodiac in the heavens,

35:22.954 --> 35:26.081
and that by going into
altered states of consciousness,

35:26.081 --> 35:30.085
ancient shamans were able to
travel into the stellar temple

35:30.085 --> 35:32.088
from the earthly temple.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.340
NARRATOR:
Do the Gemini twins
suggest a connection

35:35.340 --> 35:37.760
between Earth and the heavens?

35:37.760 --> 35:40.972
Could it be that the visions
reported at Glastonbury

35:40.972 --> 35:45.309
are messages from an advanced
extraterrestrial race?

35:45.309 --> 35:47.353
But if so, how?

35:47.353 --> 35:52.190
COLLINS:
Is it possible that all of
these astrological influences

35:52.190 --> 35:54.527
convey alien messages

35:54.527 --> 35:57.864
inbound from somewhere else
in the galaxy?

35:57.864 --> 36:00.574
Well, if the answer is yes,

36:00.574 --> 36:04.202
then the means
of this communication

36:04.202 --> 36:07.373
is what we call
quantum entanglement.

36:07.373 --> 36:10.835
NARRATOR:
The theory of
quantum entanglement states

36:10.835 --> 36:13.588
that if a particle is split
into two parts,

36:13.588 --> 36:17.382
the parts will remain connected
to one another,

36:17.382 --> 36:19.969
even when separated
over large distances.

36:19.969 --> 36:23.556
TAYLOR: If two particles are
quantum-entangled, as we say,

36:23.556 --> 36:25.766
then as they travel off
to different places

36:25.766 --> 36:28.518
in the universe,
if you do something to this one,

36:28.518 --> 36:30.855
it instantaneously
will affect this one.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.442
NARRATOR:
Scientists suspect
a potential application

36:34.442 --> 36:36.902
of quantum entanglement could be

36:36.902 --> 36:39.322
in faster-than-light
communication.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.407
HENRY:
Through the process
of quantum entanglement,

36:41.407 --> 36:45.827
an extraterrestrial being could
be millions of light-years away

36:45.827 --> 36:49.664
and still be able to communicate
with humans on Earth.

36:49.664 --> 36:52.168
NARRATOR:
Are there places on the planet

36:52.168 --> 36:55.755
where extraterrestrial contact
can take place?

36:55.755 --> 36:59.007
Is this why Katharine Maltwood
was able to recognize

36:59.007 --> 37:00.467
the signs of the zodiac

37:00.467 --> 37:03.637
incorporated into the landscape
of Glastonbury?

37:03.637 --> 37:07.516
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

37:07.516 --> 37:10.018
and suggest the message
to humankind

37:10.018 --> 37:13.271
provides not only information
about Earth,

37:13.271 --> 37:16.858
but the key to traveling
to the stars.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.407
NARRATOR:
New York City.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.746
Located in Midtown Manhattan

37:29.746 --> 37:33.416
is the busiest train station
in the United States,

37:33.416 --> 37:36.128
Grand Central Terminal.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.880
Three-quarters
of a million people

37:37.880 --> 37:40.007
come through here each day,

37:40.007 --> 37:43.635
and when they do, they pass
under an enormous star chart,

37:43.635 --> 37:46.972
one whose origins date back
some 5,000 years.

37:46.972 --> 37:51.643
When commuters walk
into Grand Central, they see

37:51.643 --> 37:56.983
an epic, magnificent mural
of the zodiac wheel.

37:56.983 --> 38:01.487
It is one of the largest
zodiac murals

38:01.487 --> 38:03.405
in the modern world.

38:03.405 --> 38:07.784
NARRATOR:
Although most visitors
are not aware of the mural

38:07.784 --> 38:11.746
above their heads, if they were,
they might be astounded,

38:11.746 --> 38:14.000
because as far as
ancient astronaut theorists

38:14.000 --> 38:17.460
are concerned, it depicts
the evolution of the Earth

38:17.460 --> 38:20.630
in extraterrestrial terms.

38:20.630 --> 38:23.175
The most interesting fact

38:23.175 --> 38:25.135
about this portion
of the zodiac wheel

38:25.135 --> 38:27.012
is that it demonstrates

38:27.012 --> 38:29.724
what is called the
precession of the equinoxes.

38:29.724 --> 38:34.686
What we call the spring equinox
is the first day of spring.

38:34.686 --> 38:37.523
Back when the principles
of astrology

38:37.523 --> 38:39.358
were first put together,

38:39.358 --> 38:42.402
the first day of spring
was in Aries.

38:42.402 --> 38:45.655
During the age of Christ,
the first day of spring

38:45.655 --> 38:47.532
was in Pisces.

38:47.532 --> 38:49.492
The fish is associated
with Pisces.

38:49.492 --> 38:52.246
Christ was considered
the fisher of men.

38:52.246 --> 38:57.460
And nowadays,
the spring equinox occurs

38:57.460 --> 39:02.757
when the Sun rises in
the constellation of Aquarius.

39:02.757 --> 39:06.719
That's why we are said to be
in the Age of Aquarius,

39:06.719 --> 39:10.014
which is supposed to be an age
of spiritual understanding,

39:10.014 --> 39:12.724
mystical awareness
and world peace.

39:14.684 --> 39:17.730
NARRATOR:
While there is no consensus
as to an exact date,

39:17.730 --> 39:20.398
many believe that
the Age of Aquarius was set

39:20.398 --> 39:24.445
by ancient astrologers to begin
in February 1962

39:24.445 --> 39:27.739
and believed that it would
trigger the rapid development

39:27.739 --> 39:29.784
of new technology.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.744
Ironically,
it began just seven years

39:32.744 --> 39:35.246
before man landed on the Moon.

39:35.246 --> 39:38.501
NEIL ARMSTRONG:
That's one small step for man,

39:38.501 --> 39:41.961
one giant leap for mankind.

39:41.961 --> 39:46.257
I guarantee you that when our
ancestors spoke about these gods

39:46.257 --> 39:47.927
descending from the sky,

39:47.927 --> 39:50.929
they were not referring
to the constellations themselves

39:50.929 --> 39:53.681
descending from the sky,
but, in my opinion,

39:53.681 --> 39:58.521
people coming from those areas
up in the night sky.

40:00.606 --> 40:04.110
HENRY:
As we are entering into
the new Age of Aquarius,

40:04.110 --> 40:05.820
according to the Sumerians,
it was Enki,

40:05.820 --> 40:08.155
is the original man of Aquarius,

40:08.155 --> 40:11.282
an otherworldly,
even extraterrestrial being.

40:11.282 --> 40:15.871
We are returning to a time
when Enki himself may return.

40:15.871 --> 40:18.791
That's perfectly consistent
with this idea that the zodiac,

40:18.791 --> 40:21.085
in fact, is a sort of a clock

40:21.085 --> 40:24.130
that tells not just about
the Sun's journey,

40:24.130 --> 40:26.798
but also about the journey
of extraterrestrials

40:26.798 --> 40:29.009
and their return to Earth.

40:29.009 --> 40:31.177
JASON MARTELL: We're now in
the Age of Aquarius,

40:31.177 --> 40:33.472
and there is a quickening effect
taking place

40:33.472 --> 40:35.474
with our technological advances.

40:35.474 --> 40:38.143
It's very possible
that we are now in the age

40:38.143 --> 40:39.978
when we are going to reconnect

40:39.978 --> 40:42.481
with our ancient alien
ancestors.

40:42.481 --> 40:45.650
NARRATOR:
Could our ancestors have been
aware of the zodiac's

40:45.650 --> 40:48.737
powerful message
thousands of years ago?

40:48.737 --> 40:52.949
And might the signs
of the zodiac provide the key

40:52.949 --> 40:58.204
to understanding both
humanity's past and future?

40:58.204 --> 41:01.000
There's a prophecy
in the Glastonbury Zodiac

41:01.000 --> 41:05.003
relating to the coming
Age of Aquarius.

41:05.003 --> 41:09.507
It's going to be a time
where our minds begin to think

41:09.507 --> 41:11.844
radically differently in a way

41:11.844 --> 41:15.847
that can transform life
on this planet for the better.

41:15.847 --> 41:19.018
In many ways, we are becoming
more enlightened,

41:19.018 --> 41:21.728
we are becoming more connected
with the cosmos,

41:21.728 --> 41:25.983
we understand more about
our roots and our origins.

41:25.983 --> 41:31.237
NARRATOR:
Might the discoveries of massive
landscape zodiacs,

41:31.237 --> 41:34.699
legends of a lost
advanced civilization

41:34.699 --> 41:38.077
and accounts of telepathic
alien transmissions

41:38.077 --> 41:42.081
be preparing humanity to
recognize a long-lost connection

41:42.081 --> 41:44.835
to otherworldly beings?

41:44.835 --> 41:48.838
Does the zodiac really contain a
message from extraterrestrials?

41:50.465 --> 41:54.637
And if so,
what is it trying to say?

41:54.637 --> 41:58.224
Perhaps when we crack
this constellation code,

41:58.224 --> 42:00.726
we will achieve
our ultimate destiny

42:00.726 --> 42:04.063
and ascend to the stars.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.106
