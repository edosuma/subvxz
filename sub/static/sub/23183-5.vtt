WEBVTT

00:10.300 --> 00:13.333
You got invited
to a party the other day...

00:13.366 --> 00:15.800
The McMurrays have invited us
over for a BBQ this afternoon.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.200
That'll be a soft pass for me.

00:17.233 --> 00:18.766
Just a soft pass?

00:18.800 --> 00:20.766
A super...soft pass.
Well, why is that?

00:20.800 --> 00:22.200
You got something else
on the go, big shooter?

00:22.233 --> 00:23.700
Well, ah, you know,
it's just Saturday.

00:23.733 --> 00:24.900
Rosie scooch on over.

00:24.933 --> 00:26.633
Watch a little TV.
Bob's your uncle.

00:26.666 --> 00:28.033
Do I have to remind you

00:28.066 --> 00:29.900
that you are in a long‐term
relationship.

00:29.933 --> 00:33.400
And...?
And as such you are obliged
to partakes in some socials

00:33.433 --> 00:35.100
stimulations from times to time,

00:35.133 --> 00:37.766
lest the young lady
becomes rastless.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.200
Rastless?
Rastless.

00:39.233 --> 00:40.933
Well, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it, bud.

00:40.966 --> 00:42.200
Sure. But you can't just

00:42.233 --> 00:43.833
watch TV and have sex
every night, Wayne.

00:43.866 --> 00:45.766
Sometimes Netflix and chill
just ain't enough.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.700
A young lady deserves more

00:46.733 --> 00:48.366
than just Amazon Primes
and sexy times.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.400
YouTube and lube
isn't gonna cut it.

00:50.433 --> 00:51.966
You can't just stream it
and cream it, bud.

00:52.000 --> 00:52.933
There's more to life

00:52.966 --> 00:54.800
than a little Hulu and
you‐screw, big brother.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.266
Gotta step out
of your comfort zone.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.766
There's not a goddamn thing
wrong with

00:57.800 --> 00:59.666
a little Playstation
Vue and I service you.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.666
Not a goddamn thing.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.900
A little Project Free TV
and you service me.

01:02.933 --> 01:04.666
A little Pirate Bay
with some sexual spray.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.100
A couple of torrent sites
minus the bed lights.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.800
What about a little satellite
and an overnight?

01:08.833 --> 01:09.933
A little satellite
and tickle fight.

01:09.966 --> 01:11.166
Invite a friend over
for Direct TV

01:11.200 --> 01:12.233
and a menage a three.

01:12.266 --> 01:13.166
Yeah, there's more to life

01:13.200 --> 01:15.966
than a li'l HBO and a go,
big brother.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.966
You gotta step out
of your comfort zone.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.033
Wanna know what? I don't know
who called it the comfort zone,

01:21.066 --> 01:22.266
but I'm pretty sure
they called it that

01:22.300 --> 01:24.700
'cause everything inside
that zone's good and comfy.

01:24.733 --> 01:27.833
So once you get outside
of that zone, fuck...

01:27.866 --> 01:30.333
Well, that's when things
can get a bit dicey.

01:30.366 --> 01:33.833
(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING)

01:41.200 --> 01:43.800
(WHISTLING)

01:43.833 --> 01:47.033
Oh! Ooh.
Welcome to Chez McMurray.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.766
MR. MCMURRAY: Oh, ho.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.100
Or, Fort McMurray.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.866
(LAUGHING)

01:53.366 --> 01:54.466
Here you go, babe.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.266
Whatever you're into
that's what I always say.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.800
ALL: McMurray!
MCMURRAY: Wayne, how're you now?

01:57.833 --> 01:59.733
WAYNE: How'r you... Oh good.
MCMURRAY: Not s'bad.

01:59.766 --> 02:01.100
WAYNE: I'm not s'...
MCMURRAY: I'm good.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.266
Just go!
Where... where is your
better half, Wayne?

02:03.300 --> 02:04.600
Reading a book.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.166
All right. Well,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.000
everybody make yourself
at home.

02:09.033 --> 02:11.666
We got cold beer
and frozen marg mix.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.633
Oh, yeah. You got blueberry,
avocado passion fruit margs?

02:14.666 --> 02:16.766
We got agave prickly pear
marg mix.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.066
Mhh hmm. Colada mix, too.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.633
You got kiwi fruit cucumber
jalapeno pina colada?

02:20.666 --> 02:21.900
We got charred orange
ruby red grapefruit

02:21.933 --> 02:23.300
pomegranate pina coladas.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.800
Even got daiquiri mix, too.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.133
Oh, you got

02:26.166 --> 02:28.200
whole citrus hungry gal
magic low cal daiquiris?

02:28.233 --> 02:29.866
We got smoky watermelon
michelada

02:29.900 --> 02:32.033
aqua velva
aqua fresca super, super

02:32.066 --> 02:34.833
duper, super sipper Daiquiris.
Good enough.

02:34.866 --> 02:36.366
Whatever you're into
is what I always say.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.566
That's right.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.900
Plus, we got a shit ton of super
fun shit planned for today.

02:39.933 --> 02:41.200
Oh, boy.
All kinds.

02:41.233 --> 02:42.900
Just went down and got myself

02:42.933 --> 02:45.866
a brand spankin' new karaoke
machine down at the swap meet.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.066
Oh, boy.
It's only got the Chinese songs,
but it works just fine.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.233
All right, lemme run down
the house rules.

02:51.266 --> 02:54.666
Rule number one:
You must have fun.

02:55.966 --> 02:57.366
That's it.
That's the only fuckin' rule.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.566
That's easy to remembers then.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.866
I hope everybody remembered
to bring their swim trunks.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.833
GLEN: Come on down, folks.
Don't be shy.

03:03.866 --> 03:06.266
The jets are powerful and
the water is warm.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.066
Plenty room for everybody.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.166
Amen. Oops. Oh, no. I went ahead
and dropped an olive.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.066
Oh!
Oh, ooh...

03:13.100 --> 03:14.633
There it is.
Oh.

03:14.666 --> 03:16.000
I feel it.

03:16.033 --> 03:17.200
Sure do...

03:17.866 --> 03:19.166
Thank you, Gail.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.966
I forgot my swim trunks, so...

03:22.000 --> 03:23.700
You forgot to bring a set?
Didn't bring a set.

03:23.733 --> 03:25.100
You didn't bring a set?
Didn't bring a set.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.900
You didn't bring a set?
I didn't brings no sets.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.766
You, even you didn't bring
a set?
I didn't bring a set.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.966
Don't worry.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.966
We got a whole bunch of extra
swim trunks in the closet.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.800
So no fuckin' excuses, okay?

03:34.833 --> 03:37.133
I'd hammer a cock suckin' gin
and tonic, that's all I know.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.200
Who wants to jump in the tub,

03:39.233 --> 03:40.933
or... can I offer somebody
some fruit?

03:40.966 --> 03:43.066
Or maybe an oyster?

03:44.800 --> 03:47.366
Where is Wayne?
Out having a dart, likely.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.333
Hm.
MCMURRAY: Thought Wayne
would love a good tub?

03:49.366 --> 03:50.766
Who wouldn't love a good tub?

03:50.800 --> 03:52.000
Well, he does.

03:52.033 --> 03:53.966
He just says that if you spend
too much time in the water,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.633
you end up looking like
a golden raisin.

03:55.666 --> 03:57.033
I think I just brushed up

03:57.066 --> 03:58.933
against a couple
of golden raisins.

03:58.966 --> 04:00.966
Gail, oh, my. Scandal.
Hmmm.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.766
Would anyone care
to play a game?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.000
Has anybody ever played
Never have I ever?

04:06.033 --> 04:07.233
Nevers.
Never?

04:07.266 --> 04:09.100
Never ever.
Not even once.

04:09.133 --> 04:10.866
It is a dandy little
drinking game

04:10.900 --> 04:12.733
we picked
up down 'Minican.

04:12.766 --> 04:14.366
We go down 'Minican
twice a year, that's all I know.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.766
Still don't get down
'Minican enough, baby,

04:15.800 --> 04:16.966
that's true.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.833
Was down 'Pulco pertnear
every winter 'til fellas started

04:18.866 --> 04:20.900
gettin' hanging from bridges
with their dinks cut off.

04:20.933 --> 04:21.933
Crying shame

04:21.966 --> 04:23.900
because Sinatra used to have
a place down 'Pulco.

04:23.933 --> 04:25.133
You know, JFK and Jackie O

04:25.166 --> 04:26.500
had their goddamn honeymoon
down 'Pulco.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.300
But we picked up Never Have
I Ever down in 'Minican.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.866
K.
So, how it works
is this.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.033
You say, "Never have I ever"

04:33.066 --> 04:35.400
done such and such a titillating
and or embarrassing act

04:35.433 --> 04:37.700
and if you've done it,
you drink it. Get it?

04:37.733 --> 04:39.833
Got it.
I'll start.

04:39.866 --> 04:42.066
Fire away, baby.
And make it randy.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.200
Oh, yeah.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.066
(SQUEALS)

04:47.266 --> 04:49.033
Uh, let's see, never have
I ever

04:49.066 --> 04:52.266
made whoopee with
more than one person at a time.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.266
We're going from zero
to sixty I take it.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.833
MCMURRAY: Uh hm. Oh.

04:56.866 --> 04:58.833
Your turn, baby.
All right.

04:58.866 --> 05:03.133
Never have I ever felt
strong sexual urges

05:03.166 --> 05:07.133
towards another spouse,
significant other or sibling.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.600
That's very specific.

05:12.133 --> 05:13.666
Hey, Wayne, how's your beer?

05:13.700 --> 05:15.833
WAYNE: I'd have a beer.
MCMURRAY: Katy, don't...

05:15.866 --> 05:18.033
Can you can bring me over
one of them cocksuckers,

05:18.066 --> 05:19.000
that's what I always say.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.133
Buddy,
I think we plateaued.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.633
What are
you talking about, buddy?

05:25.666 --> 05:27.600
Like I'm not seein'
any gains, bro.

05:30.066 --> 05:32.333
I've been free posing
in front of the mirror at home.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.100
Maybe it's time we did
a full circuit together, ferda.
Ferda.

05:40.933 --> 05:43.166
(SQUEALING)

05:55.033 --> 05:56.333
BOTH: Pose def...

05:59.933 --> 06:00.866
I think you're right, buddy.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.700
Yeah, I haven't seen
any gains all year, bro.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.900
We gotta make some serious
gains for next season, ferda.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.166
Capital gains, buddy.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.166
Coach has already texted sayin'
how are the gains going, boys.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.033
Saying what?

06:10.066 --> 06:11.666
Saying, how are
the gains going, boys.

06:11.700 --> 06:12.966
Can't let coach down,
buddy.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.400
(SCOFFS) Not an option, bro.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.266
He'll send something flying.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.333
Scares the shit out of me,
sometimes.

06:16.366 --> 06:19.100
Our gains have to eclipse
general team gains, buddy.

06:19.133 --> 06:20.766
You wanna be the guy to walk
into the room

06:20.800 --> 06:22.633
and none of
the boys see gains?

06:22.666 --> 06:24.200
If gains fall in the forest
and no one's around

06:24.233 --> 06:26.266
to see it, nobody really
sees any gains.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.266
If you don't see gains,
what do you see?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.200
BOTH: Excuses.
We can't be those guys,
buddy.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.200
No excuses, buddy.
Clock's ticking, bro.

06:32.233 --> 06:33.800
Not a lot of time
for gains, bro.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.300
Charlotte Gains, bro.
No.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.233
We need a surge of gains, bro.

06:38.266 --> 06:39.900
Canseco, buddy.

06:40.766 --> 06:42.700
Sammy Sosa, buddy.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.000
At what cost, Buddy?

06:44.033 --> 06:46.100
What's the cost of juice, buddy?

06:46.133 --> 06:47.900
Maybe rip a quick half cycle.

06:47.933 --> 06:49.966
Maybe we just dig deep.
Bare down.

06:50.266 --> 06:51.766
Or...

06:51.800 --> 06:53.066
Roger Clemens, buddy.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.366
Hey!
What?

06:54.400 --> 06:56.733
All‐Star pitcher, buddy.
Tarnished reputation, buddy.

06:56.766 --> 06:57.833
Hey!
What?

06:57.866 --> 06:59.966
Starting pitcher for the
Toronto Blue Jays, buddy.

07:01.866 --> 07:03.100
Just a half cycle?

07:03.133 --> 07:05.733
Just a quick half cycle.
Push through the plateau,

07:05.766 --> 07:07.300
kick start the muscle fibers,

07:07.333 --> 07:10.100
go cold turkey before
the season starts, buddy.

07:10.133 --> 07:11.400
Cold turkey?
Cold turkey.

07:11.433 --> 07:13.633
Au naturale.
Au naturale.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.366
Naturale.
Au naturale.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.166
Ferda.
Ferda.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.666
Yeah, but wait!

07:20.333 --> 07:22.033
Where do we get the juice from,
ferda?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.866
Oh, I think I know
just the place, buddy.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.200
Tanis? How'r...

07:34.766 --> 07:36.000
...now?

07:39.100 --> 07:41.966
So where's this party at?
Basement.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.766
Don't see your swim trunks.
Didn't bring a set?
No, I didn't bring a set.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.166
Well, inside they'll likely
have a set.
Didn't know I'd need that set.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.200
They'll get you a set.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.166
You know what the McMurrays
are up to, right?

07:50.866 --> 07:52.366
I have an inkling.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.166
And you don't mind leaving
your girl down there with them?

07:55.200 --> 07:57.366
She didn't make the trek.
(CHUCKLES)

07:57.400 --> 07:59.633
Reading?
Can't confirm.

07:59.666 --> 08:01.866
Doesn't that make you think
she up to something?

08:01.900 --> 08:03.633
Makes me think
it's a pretty good book.

08:04.033 --> 08:05.166
Must be like...

08:06.833 --> 08:08.100
Carrie?

08:08.133 --> 08:12.800
Well, when the cat's away
the mice will play. Hmm?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.133
The rats too, apparently.

08:17.433 --> 08:19.066
You're dirty, huh.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.966
All right,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.166
I'm gonna go home.
I just came here for you, boo.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.333
You know we have a really
big library on the Rez too,

08:27.366 --> 08:29.100
if you're
into nerdy girls,

08:29.133 --> 08:31.766
I can show you my spine label,
you can show me your hard cover.

08:33.266 --> 08:34.366
On a...

08:37.900 --> 08:39.333
KATY: How's your beer,
big brother?

08:45.366 --> 08:46.966
I'd have a beer.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So, tell me,

08:49.033 --> 08:51.733
how do you boys feel
about havin' adventures?

08:51.766 --> 08:53.200
Well, I'm not against
havin' adventures.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.200
Then how do you feel
about trying new things?

08:55.233 --> 08:56.966
Well, like I always say,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.066
varieties is
the spices of life.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.233
Mrs. McMurray and I
couldn't agree more.

09:01.266 --> 09:02.700
That's all I know.

09:02.733 --> 09:05.133
In fact, the more you get
to know us both,

09:05.166 --> 09:08.933
the more you realize that
we're very broad‐minded.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.400
That's what I always say.

09:10.433 --> 09:11.933
Well, the other day,

09:11.966 --> 09:13.800
I tried cinnamon chewing gum
for the first time.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.933
Huh.
Well, it was a little bit
spicy for my taste,

09:15.966 --> 09:17.333
I can't say
that I didn't like it.

09:17.366 --> 09:20.800
Gotta love those spicy
little cocksuckers, uh?

09:21.400 --> 09:23.100
Okay.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.300
Katy, how's your beer?

09:25.333 --> 09:26.766
KATY: I'd love a beer.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.933
Oh, huh.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.666
Ah, I lost another one.
Whoopsie daisy.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.000
Slippery little buggers.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.966
Oh! She's in the neighborhood.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.133
Maybe it's time
to get going.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.666
Agreed.
How do we do that?

09:45.866 --> 09:47.266
Guess what?
DARYL AND KATY: What?

09:47.300 --> 09:49.900
This may very well call for
the Irish Goodbye.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.166
What's the Irish Goodbye?

09:51.200 --> 09:53.133
Well, that's when you leave
without saying bye to anyone.

09:53.166 --> 09:55.900
Also known as the French Exit
or Houdini.

09:55.933 --> 09:57.966
Thought the French Exit
was when you climax on a gal,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.266
and you leave without
cleaning it up.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.866
It's almost not worth
thinking about, Dary.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.000
Technically, a French Exit

10:02.033 --> 10:03.400
is when you leave without
paying the bill.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.166
But in this case,
that is not applicable.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.733
Guess what?
BOTH: What?

10:06.766 --> 10:09.166
This may very well call
for the Turkish Takeoff.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.400
What's a Turkish Takeoff?

10:10.433 --> 10:12.766
That's when you pull a fire
alarm and leave with a stranger.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.166
Guess what?
BOTH: What?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.066
This very well may call
for the old Tokyo Sayonara.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.300
What's Tokyo Sayonara?

10:18.333 --> 10:21.233
Well, that's when you leave
and only say goodbye to the cat.

10:21.266 --> 10:23.000
Maybe this calls for...

10:23.033 --> 10:24.366
No!
BOTH: What?

10:26.933 --> 10:28.300
Maybe this calls for
the Letterkenny Leave.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.266
No!
Letterkenny Leave?

10:30.300 --> 10:32.033
That's when you steal
a two‐four

10:32.066 --> 10:33.800
and walk through
a sliding glass door.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.300
Well, desperate times.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.700
Desperate measures.

10:39.133 --> 10:43.233
I don't think we're there
just yet. But, why not,

10:43.266 --> 10:45.233
let's continue to monitor
the situation.

10:46.233 --> 10:47.666
Time for more mix.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.233
I'll get the colada mix,
baby.

10:54.133 --> 10:55.900
Dart?
I'd have a dart.

10:55.933 --> 10:57.266
Squirrely Dan.
Waynes.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.733
Has it occurred to you
that those two

10:58.766 --> 11:00.900
may be members of...

11:00.933 --> 11:02.233
Of the Lifestyle?

11:02.266 --> 11:05.000
Like the agricultural
management lifestyle?

11:05.033 --> 11:06.833
Sure they are.
No, Dan.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.066
The Lifestyle.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.266
Like the livestocks management
lifestyle. Of course they are.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.666
No, Daniel.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.266
The Lifestyle.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.866
Oh, dairy farming lifestyle.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.166
You guys know they are.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.733
(YELLS) Squirrely Dan!
Uh‐hmm?

11:23.366 --> 11:25.233
Uh, the Lifestyle?

11:37.400 --> 11:38.833
No, I'm not too sure

11:38.866 --> 11:40.100
what you're driving at here,
big shooter.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.000
All righty.

11:44.033 --> 11:46.866
Who wants to play
Pass the Banana?

11:51.066 --> 11:53.866
Well, well, well,
my chemical bromance.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.966
Bro Thornton
and Bro Jonas.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.266
We're in the market for some
banned substances, buddy.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.833
Oh, and you've come
to us.

12:00.866 --> 12:03.100
How flattering.
We've got substances.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.433
And guess what?

12:04.466 --> 12:08.266
Newsflash, Bill "the thrill"
O'Reilly... they're all banned.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.200
So what will it be,
Geoff and Rus Courtnall...

12:10.233 --> 12:11.866
You know what a nose beer is?
Booger sugar.

12:11.900 --> 12:12.966
...tini.
The cola.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.300
BOTH: No.
No.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.733
Then what will it be,
Wayne and Keith Primeau?

12:16.766 --> 12:18.166
You into sextaxcy?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.366
Rollsy pollsy's?
The beans?

12:19.400 --> 12:20.700
The disco biscuits?

12:20.733 --> 12:22.200
BOTH: No.
Do not tell me

12:22.233 --> 12:24.133
you've come here
looking for pot.

12:24.166 --> 12:27.100
No, no, we're looking for
some, uh...
Juice.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.266
Huh?
Sauce.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.033
Huh?
Gear.

12:30.066 --> 12:32.200
BOTH: Steroids.
Ah!

12:32.233 --> 12:34.200
A‐bombs.
Anti‐hero.

12:34.233 --> 12:36.800
Gym candy. Why didn't you
say so?

12:36.833 --> 12:39.966
JONESY: What the fuck? Jesus.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.666
Edibles. You're welcome.
So, you wish to

12:43.700 --> 12:46.100
improve upon that form
God gave you.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.900
Just a half‐cycle, buddy.
Ah, sweet hubris.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.966
Oh, what's that?
Excessive pride,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.166
or self confidence.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.200
Arrogance. Pomposity.
Egotism.

12:54.233 --> 12:57.833
One does not simply hop
on or of the Anabolia Express.

12:57.866 --> 12:59.133
No.

12:59.166 --> 13:03.633
You ride that juice train all
the way to the end of the line.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.133
Choo‐choo.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.100
No, we're just trying
to push through a plateau, so...

13:07.133 --> 13:08.900
Need more Charlotte Gains, bro.

13:08.933 --> 13:10.166
Just a quick Serge
of Gains, bro.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.300
Before the season starts,
going cold turkey.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, au naturale.
Yeah.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.933
(LAUGHING)

13:15.966 --> 13:17.333
Famous last words,
gentlemen

13:17.366 --> 13:18.800
Have you discussed
side effects?

13:18.833 --> 13:19.866
What side effects?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.266
Oh, just a little dilemma
known as severe back acne.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.366
Bacne?
It's fine.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.300
And a little complication,
acute testicular shrinkage.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.866
Testicle shrinkage?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.900
Nobody's testicles
are going to shrinkage, buddy.

13:30.933 --> 13:32.233
Of course that

13:32.266 --> 13:34.833
can of worms known
as 'roid rage.

13:34.866 --> 13:36.166
That actually
happens, buddy.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
Almost to everyone, buddy.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.866
Pay the man.
I mean, maybe we should just,
you know...

13:40.900 --> 13:42.833
Dig deep, you know.
Bare down.

13:42.866 --> 13:44.666
I mean, side effects, buddy.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.300
But you guys should be good.
Yeah, we should be good.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.266
Should be good.
Yeah? We should be good?

13:48.300 --> 13:49.366
I wouldn't worry.
No.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
No, it should be good.
For sure?

13:50.433 --> 13:52.766
If you want my honest opinion,
you should be good.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.400
'Cause if like you say
we're good...
You're good.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.266
Yeah?
You should be good.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.666
Wheel, snipe,
celly boys.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.200
Yeah, dirty fuckin'
dangles, boys.

14:00.233 --> 14:01.600
(YELLS) Pay the man.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.633
Did I ever tell you
about my friend, Juan‐Jorge?

14:05.666 --> 14:07.066
No, I don't believes
you haves.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.766
Well, Juan‐Jorge is one of our
closest and dearest friends.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.866
We met him
and his wife down 'Minican.

14:11.900 --> 14:12.966
Mm‐hm.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.300
Juan‐Jorge is a birdwatcher.

14:14.333 --> 14:17.033
Or a "birder" as they prefer
to be called, these days.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.800
Hmm.
Anyway, one day

14:18.833 --> 14:20.266
in a hot tub, not unlike
this one,

14:20.300 --> 14:23.266
Juan‐Jorge told first
me about the common cuckoo bird.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.300
The cuckoo bird
has a peculiar habit

14:25.333 --> 14:27.666
of laying its eggs
in another bird's nest.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.366
Well, that is
a peculiars habits.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.366
And it is from
this peculiar habit,

14:31.400 --> 14:33.300
that we get the English term

14:34.166 --> 14:35.733
cuckold.

14:35.766 --> 14:36.800
Huh.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.633
Are you familiar with
that term, Squirrely Dan?

14:38.666 --> 14:40.666
I believes I have heards
in passings, yes.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.733
Juan‐Jorge believes cuckoldry

14:42.766 --> 14:46.000
to be the purest and highest
form of sexual arousal.

14:46.033 --> 14:48.733
This Juan‐Jorge sounds
like a real interestings fellas.

14:48.766 --> 14:50.633
Uh‐hmm.
You better believe it,

14:50.666 --> 14:54.000
that's all I've got to say.
Oh, you better believe it.

14:54.033 --> 14:56.800
In fact, according to Juan‐Jorge

14:56.833 --> 15:00.966
only the sweet, sweet agony
and pure psychological torment

15:01.000 --> 15:02.366
of watching a physically
superior man

15:02.400 --> 15:04.733
pleasure his beloved wife

15:04.766 --> 15:07.233
is enough
to truly excite him.

15:07.266 --> 15:09.300
Just look at this big ol'
paw of yours, huh?

15:09.333 --> 15:11.666
Look at that cocksucker, baby.

15:11.700 --> 15:12.766
See, now most people think

15:12.800 --> 15:15.000
just about one fella sleeping
with another's wife,

15:15.033 --> 15:17.900
but no, Juan‐Jorge believes

15:17.933 --> 15:20.800
and explains in such
an arrangement,

15:20.833 --> 15:24.366
that the real and
true connection is in fact,

15:24.400 --> 15:26.233
between the bull...

15:27.166 --> 15:29.666
And the cuckoo bird,
so to speak.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.300
Huh. Daryl, how's your beer?

15:37.333 --> 15:38.866
DARYL: Yeah, I could
have a beer.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.333
Maybe it's time
we pulls a Brexit.

15:48.366 --> 15:49.600
WAYNE, KATY AND DARYL: Shh.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.333
Guess what?
ALL: What?

15:54.366 --> 15:57.833
It very well maybe time
to pull the Singapore Scram.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.133
What's a Singapore Scram?

15:59.166 --> 16:00.666
It's when you grab
onto a rope wire

16:00.700 --> 16:01.866
and have a helicopter fly
you out of there.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.166
Nobody's flying away
anywhere, that's all I know.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.133
Hell, no. It's karaoke time.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.666
ALL: Over and out.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.300
What's on the menu
this evening, my dear?

16:11.333 --> 16:13.700
I need my rits.
Hmm.

16:13.733 --> 16:16.033
Burning the candle
at both ends, are we?

16:16.066 --> 16:17.966
Finals are coming.
I need my rits to study.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.066
Well, don't move.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.033
Darien.

16:22.700 --> 16:23.833
The Ritalin.

16:25.433 --> 16:26.966
Good luck on your exams.

16:30.266 --> 16:32.133
These aren't my rits.
Come again?

16:32.166 --> 16:34.100
Anabolic steroids.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.800
Those are 'roids
not 'rits.

16:35.833 --> 16:37.933
But that means...
I need my rits.

16:37.966 --> 16:39.866
That means you sold
the gym rats rits,

16:39.900 --> 16:41.933
not 'roids,
you rapscallion.

16:41.966 --> 16:44.133
I need my rits not 'roids.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.400
Those were meant
to be rits not 'roids.

16:46.433 --> 16:49.300
Yet, here we are,
'roids not rits.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.366
Uh hm. Rit‐tidiculous.
Oh, 'roid‐ally.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.733
(SCREAMS) Rits!

16:57.066 --> 16:58.333
Locked and loaded, bro.

16:58.366 --> 17:00.433
Bring on the gains, boys.
Capital gains, boys.

17:00.466 --> 17:03.100
Charlotte Gains, bro.
A quick Serge of Gains, bro.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.300
Focus is?
Traps and tri's buddy.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.233
Traps and tri's, bro.

17:06.266 --> 17:07.933
We should be ripping
sand bell slammers.

17:07.966 --> 17:09.500
We should be ripping
kettleball sumo deadlifts.

17:09.533 --> 17:12.233
We should be ripping
standing V‐bar pushdowns.

17:12.266 --> 17:13.366
We should be ripping cable
hammer curls

17:13.400 --> 17:14.466
with rope
attachment.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.900
We should be ripping close
grip EZ bar curls with band.

17:16.933 --> 17:19.266
We should be ripping standing
dumbbell reverse spider curls.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.466
We should be ripping

17:20.500 --> 17:22.333
two arm barbell wide grip
preachers curls.

17:22.366 --> 17:24.266
Like Arnold, buddy.
Uh‐hmmm.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.866
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:30.066 --> 17:31.166
I don't know what's going on

17:31.200 --> 17:33.133
but I don't feel like ripping
V‐Bar tricep pushdowns.

17:33.166 --> 17:34.900
Maybe it's
the half cycle, buddy.

17:34.933 --> 17:36.200
I know what you mean,
buddy.
Maybe we should rip

17:36.233 --> 17:38.166
a full cycle, buddy.
Full cycle, buddy.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.433
Ferds. Uh, great.

17:39.466 --> 17:41.200
One more rip and then
we rip super sets

17:41.233 --> 17:43.100
of standing
sand bell tricep extendies.

17:43.133 --> 17:45.266
One more rip and we rip
standing bicep stretchies.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.100
We should b ripping
one arm cable curlies.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.600
We should be ripping advanced
alternate air bike ab rollies.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.200
We should be ripping
rollout incline heel touchies.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.366
We should be ripping bent
press barbell side bendies.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.333
We should be ripping...
We should be ripping...

17:56.366 --> 17:59.266
We should be ripping...
We should be ripping...

17:59.300 --> 18:00.933

cable twisties, ferda!

18:03.100 --> 18:04.100
Ferda.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.100
So if we rip ten super sets

18:08.133 --> 18:09.833
at a rate of ten or every
fifteen minutes, that's...

18:09.866 --> 18:11.866
How many reps
per super set, buddy?

18:11.900 --> 18:13.366
Twenty reps per super set.
Make that 30.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.466
Done, buddy.
Now double it.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.333
If we rip 60 reps per super set

18:16.366 --> 18:18.066
at a rate of 10 every
15 minutes, that means

18:18.100 --> 18:19.533
we'll need to rip sixteen
and a half

18:19.566 --> 18:21.466
more half‐cycles
before the next season starts.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.566
Can't let coach down, buddy.
Not an option, buddy.

18:24.266 --> 18:25.300
It's beautiful.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.933
We're gonna need
a bigger blackboard.

18:28.966 --> 18:30.200
What's this, boys?

18:30.233 --> 18:31.533
Nothing, Snipes.
Nothing, Snipes.

18:31.566 --> 18:33.466
Does Ritalin help
get gains?

18:33.500 --> 18:36.500
Should we try it?
Rits not 'roids, then?

18:36.533 --> 18:39.100
Those are rits.
Not 'roids?

18:39.133 --> 18:41.000
BOTH: Rits not 'roids, boys.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.900
Maybe we should

18:46.233 --> 18:47.966
dig deep?
Bare down.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.900
Natural gains, bro?

18:49.933 --> 18:51.533
A Serge of Natural Gains, bro.

18:51.566 --> 18:53.366

19:08.233 --> 19:09.800
She's got the voice
of an angel, doesn't she?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.133
Oh, it's catchy.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.066
(SQUEALS)

19:25.100 --> 19:26.900
Oof!
Bravo!

19:26.933 --> 19:28.166
Bravo and brava.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.000
And then there were four.

19:31.033 --> 19:33.900
Oh, yeah.
I have a few ground rules
I'd like to cover.

19:33.933 --> 19:36.033
Pertaining to...
Shoot.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.933
No open mouth kissing

19:37.966 --> 19:39.400
on the mouth.
Pardon?

19:39.433 --> 19:42.566
Observed.
Figging and cupping
and light electro‐play

19:42.600 --> 19:43.766
are all on the table.

19:43.800 --> 19:48.233
But I do have soft limits on K9
role play and mummification.

19:48.266 --> 19:50.133
GLEN: Excuse me?
Observed.

19:50.166 --> 19:54.133
No tushy play unless
I ask for it and I will ask

19:54.433 --> 19:55.533
for it.

19:55.566 --> 19:56.900
What?
Observed.

19:56.933 --> 19:57.833
Once we get started,

19:57.866 --> 19:59.933
it is recommended that
you do not look me

19:59.966 --> 20:01.066
directly in the eye.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.966
Safe word.
Huh?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.966
Close, Glen,
but my safe word is uhunn.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.466
Once again?
Uhunnn!

20:09.000 --> 20:12.433
Oh! Oh, my,
you all are polyamorous.

20:12.466 --> 20:13.533
BOTH: Bingo!

20:13.566 --> 20:15.200
Despite being in wedlock.

20:15.233 --> 20:16.400
BOTH: Bulls‐eye.

20:16.433 --> 20:18.133
Oh, that's a sin.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.266
I'm going to have
to skedaddle.

20:20.300 --> 20:23.566
Tokyo Sayonara
for me. Where's that kitty?

20:23.600 --> 20:25.300
Squirrely Dan.
Uh‐huh?

20:25.333 --> 20:28.500
So now do you see
what we mean by the Lifestyle?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.300
Yup.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.233
Who'd have thought the McMurrays
would've been the swinging type.

20:32.366 --> 20:34.566
I could have told you that
before we got over there, bud.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.300
Nobody wouldsa thunk it.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.933
Pertnear, everyone in town
thunk it.

20:37.966 --> 20:39.533
Why do you think
Rosie stayed home to read?

20:39.566 --> 20:41.033
It must be a pretty good book.

20:41.566 --> 20:42.933
It must be like...

20:44.300 --> 20:46.200
The Boy at The Leafs Camp.

20:46.233 --> 20:48.233
They seem so normal.
Do they?

20:49.300 --> 20:52.400
They walks among us...
Undetecteds.

20:52.433 --> 20:54.500
Well, I say,
live and let live.

20:54.533 --> 20:55.500
Oh, me too.

20:55.533 --> 20:57.700
Yeah. To each his
and hers own. Am I right?

20:57.733 --> 21:00.400
Sure. But you wanna
know what?

21:00.433 --> 21:03.200
It sure is nice
to be back in the comfort zone.

(PHONE VIBRATING)

21:08.266 --> 21:09.433

21:15.533 --> 21:16.933
Hard yes.
