[Tyson] Ah, shit!

31:36.120 --> 31:40.600
It's fine. You know what?
Let's save it for another time.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.440
It's never happened
to me before. Ever!

31:42.480 --> 31:46.160
[Eleona] Yeah. I...I totally
believe you. And it's fine.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.960
And you know what?
I've actually got to go back up.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.640
So... Oh!

31:50.680 --> 31:52.000
-Chuck us me knickers.
-Yeah.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.000
[Tyson] Yeah.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.320
Well, another successful shift
of being objectified.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.400
Lucky they tip well,
I guess.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.360
[Sighs] I need a drink.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.720

32:49.680 --> 32:51.360
Very.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.000
Well, sometimes you just
need to take the plunge.

32:56.040 --> 32:59.360
Nah. Not tonight.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.640
Long day?

33:04.840 --> 33:07.640
Yep. Help me up.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.800

[Shanika drops bag]

34:17.320 --> 34:19.000
Where have you been?

34:19.040 --> 34:21.160
Hunting.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
Do you know how dumb that is?!

34:26.160 --> 34:27.760
Not as dumb as getting drunk.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.680
And definitely not as dumb
as sleeping outside.

34:31.720 --> 34:33.600
-Hey!
-Free food for the suckers.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.400
You don't tell me what I know!

34:35.440 --> 34:37.120
I'm the boss here.

34:37.160 --> 34:40.280
OK? No solo hunting allowed.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.560
I can handle myself.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.000
Oh, yeah,
you big woman now, eh?

34:45.040 --> 34:46.720
Mm-hm. Yep.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.120
Hey, you need me.

34:49.160 --> 34:52.000
I'm the closest thing
to a blood hunter you got left!

34:52.040 --> 34:53.600
Nah.

34:53.640 --> 34:55.320
Blood hunters are warriors.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.080
You're just a drunk.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.480
[Sighs]

34:58.520 --> 35:00.720

have saved my mum.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.800
Hey.

You caught a vamp
all by yourself, eh?

37:31.720 --> 37:34.240
That's some mean shit
for a teenager.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.600
For real, bub.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.960
Look...

37:43.880 --> 37:46.200
I'm sorry about
what I said before.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.160
Truth is I always wanted
to be a blood hunter.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.480
The best blood hunter ever.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.320
Went through all the
training there. Look...

38:03.640 --> 38:05.600
And then I found you.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.680
And you was just standing there.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.280
You were alone
and you were cryin'.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.200
And they wanted me
to leave you there.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.760
But I couldn't do it.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.520
I just... I dunno. I...

38:29.840 --> 38:31.960
I couldn't leave you there, bub.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.440
So I picked you up...

38:34.640 --> 38:36.040
..and then I brought you here.

38:39.120 --> 38:42.920
Ah, 10 years! Bloody hell.
I still can't leave you.

Yeah, I'm scared, bub.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.760
I'm scared every day
of losing you.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.800
I'm scared of you being alone.

..I'm a shit dad. [Sobs]

39:10.360 --> 39:12.240

down, we go down together.
