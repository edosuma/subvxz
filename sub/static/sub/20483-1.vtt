Gosh almighty.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.400
The Johns Hopkins Science Review
<i>with Dr. George Gey.</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:47.795
In this jar, we have a sample
of cancerous human tissue.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.391
What makes this sample so unique

01:50.480 --> 01:53.314
is that this is the first cell line
we have discovered

01:53.400 --> 01:55.790
in over 30 years of trying

01:55.880 --> 01:59.032
that can survive and reproduce indefinitely.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.394
<i>With this, scientists will</i>
<i>be able to perform experiments</i>

02:03.480 --> 02:06.951
<i>that they never could</i>
<i>on a living human being.</i>

02:07.040 --> 02:09.032
Growing like crabgrass.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.029
Free of charge!

02:13.320 --> 02:15.516
Well, how many vials do you want?

02:18.640 --> 02:20.632
<i>Known as "HeLa," this cell strain</i>

02:20.720 --> 02:23.952
<i>has since been given to laboratories</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

02:26.880 --> 02:30.760
<i>Used by doctors and scientists</i>
<i>to perform experiments and research,</i>

02:30.840 --> 02:33.639
<i>starting with Dr. Salk's polio vaccine.</i>

02:38.600 --> 02:40.398
<i>Who owns the patent on this vaccine?</i>

02:40.480 --> 02:41.675
<i>The people, I would say.</i>

02:41.760 --> 02:42.750
<i>There is no patent.</i>

02:42.840 --> 02:44.320
<i>Would you patent the sun?</i>

02:44.840 --> 02:47.150
Did you know the donor?

02:47.240 --> 02:51.029
No. No, but towards the end of her life,

02:51.120 --> 02:54.352
I leaned over her hospital bed.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.999
By this time, she was unconscious,

02:56.080 --> 03:01.519
and I said to her,
"Your cells are going to help a lot of people

03:01.600 --> 03:04.035
"and make you immortal."

03:05.440 --> 03:07.193
What was her name?

03:07.560 --> 03:09.677
We see no reason why an interesting story

03:09.760 --> 03:12.195
could not be written without using her name.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.479
And so, George, rather than run the risk
of getting in trouble for disclosing it,

03:16.600 --> 03:22.597
<i>the cell strain should be referred to as "HeLa"</i>
<i>and the patient's name not be used.</i>

03:24.800 --> 03:26.029
Helen, Helen Lane.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.399
...remarkable advances
in medicine and surgery

03:44.480 --> 03:46.278
that are bringing us tomorrow's medicine.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.880
<i>For years, it seemed like a dream,</i>

04:39.240 --> 04:41.755
<i>not knowing what was going on,</i>

04:44.040 --> 04:48.193
<i>not knowing who to go to for understanding.</i>

04:50.560 --> 04:53.871
<i>Didn't even know how to talk about it.</i>

04:54.280 --> 04:57.193
<i>About our mother? Could this be true?</i>

04:58.640 --> 05:00.711
<i>We miss you.</i>

05:01.400 --> 05:03.471
<i>And we love you, Mama.</i>

05:09.680 --> 05:13.469
Freelance science
and medical writer and editor.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.676
Yes.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.030
With a degree in...

05:17.120 --> 05:18.793
Biological sciences.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.115
And,

05:21.400 --> 05:26.316
this represents the entirety
of your journalistic career?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.517
Yes, well, thus far.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.673
Deborah is Henrietta's baby girl.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.035
The family calls her "Dale."

05:38.160 --> 05:42.677
<i>She's 50 now, living in Baltimore</i>
<i>with grandchildren of her own.</i>

05:42.760 --> 05:47.039
<i>She's the most determined to know about</i>
<i>her mother and the most vulnerable.</i>

05:47.120 --> 05:51.478
<i>Deborah came near a stroke recently</i>
<i>because of all the agony she's gone through</i>

05:51.760 --> 05:55.117
<i>regarding the inquiries</i>
<i>into her mother's death and those cells.</i>

05:55.920 --> 05:57.639
I won't be a part of anyone
doing that to her.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.075
Oh, no, no, I... Dr...

05:59.160 --> 06:01.880
What can you tell me
about African-Americans and science?

06:02.840 --> 06:07.960
Well, from 1932 to '72,
the U.S. Public Health Service, uh,

06:08.040 --> 06:10.953
withheld treatment from
a group of African-American men

06:11.040 --> 06:15.193
infected with syphilis so they could study
the long-term effects of the disease.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.840
- And look, I know I'm white...
- And from Portland.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.118
Yes. Yeah. That's right.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.269
But when I was in high school,

06:25.360 --> 06:30.037
my father got very sick
and ended up in a research study.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.880
And, in my opinion, the hospital,

06:33.760 --> 06:37.231
you know, they didn't behave
in the most ethical manner,

06:37.320 --> 06:40.711
and I remember being very angry about that.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.360
And at the same time,
I was taking a biology class

06:43.440 --> 06:44.920
at a community college,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.834
and the teacher told us about the cells
and how they've been

06:47.920 --> 06:50.913
at the forefront of basically
every major medical breakthrough,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.390
and they belonged
to a black woman named Henrietta Lacks.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.520
And after the class, I asked him,
"What can you tell me about her?"

06:57.600 --> 06:59.876
And, you know, the second he told me
that he didn't know anything,

06:59.960 --> 07:01.758
I just became obsessed with it.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.992
And, Dr. Pattillo,
the Lacks family trusts you,

07:05.080 --> 07:08.118
so if there is anything
that you could do to help me

07:08.240 --> 07:14.840
connect with Henrietta Lacks' children,
I would be so, so grateful.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.879
Yeah, who's this?

07:27.960 --> 07:31.112
<i>Hi, my name is Rebecca Skloot. How are you?</i>

07:31.720 --> 07:33.074
Mmm-hmm.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.991
<i>Dr. Pattillo actually gave me your...</i>

07:36.080 --> 07:38.595
- How's he doing?
- <i>He's fine.</i>

07:38.680 --> 07:43.197
I'm not sure exactly how much he told you
about what I'm trying to do.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.478
Just that you was gonna ask me some questions

07:46.560 --> 07:49.394
about my mama's cells.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.633
<i>Yes, yes, well, um,</i>

07:51.720 --> 07:56.431
uh, I want to write a book about your mother.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.070
<i>And while there's all this stuff
about her cells,</i>

08:00.160 --> 08:04.473
<i>it always struck me</i>
<i>that nobody ever wrote about her or her life,</i>

08:04.560 --> 08:08.349
<i>and that's why I've been</i>
<i>trying to track you down</i>

08:08.440 --> 08:13.390
and your family down to see if you would be
interested in working with me,

08:13.480 --> 08:17.599
<i>and just telling me, um, more about...</i>
<i>About her.</i>

08:25.640 --> 08:28.951
Well, all I gotta say
about that is, hallelujah!

08:29.040 --> 08:31.839
<i>Finally, somebody want to talk about my mama.</i>

08:31.920 --> 08:33.592
<i>Because back when I was a child,</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:36.354
old folks, they didn't talk
about nobody who wasn't alive,

08:36.440 --> 08:39.159
so my whole life,
I grew up not knowing one thing,

08:39.240 --> 08:42.711
not even the littlest things,
like what was her favorite color,

08:42.799 --> 08:46.680
or... Or what happened to her clothes,
her shoes?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.399
Now, I know about that watch and ring

08:48.480 --> 08:50.870
'cause they got stolen
by the time my brother killed that boy.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.032
<i>What exactly did her cells do?</i>

08:54.120 --> 08:55.918
Girl, you better get yourself ready,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.356
'cause this story
is crazy enough for three books.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.794
I'm ready, I'm ready.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.112
Bet you didn't know my mother's sister
converted herself to Puerto Rican.

09:04.980 --> 09:09.517
And that state hospital, "the hospital
for crazy Negroes" they used to call it,

09:09.600 --> 09:11.319
<i>we are not skipping over that part.</i>

09:12.160 --> 09:15.232
Plus all the things
I've been dying to know, really,

09:15.320 --> 09:17.551
but don't 'cause she died
when I was so young.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.156
Like, did she... Did she breastfeed me?

09:21.240 --> 09:24.074
Did she... Did she love to dance?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.753
<i>No, it's... I'm...</i>

09:25.840 --> 09:28.719
It sounds like
we really want to do similar things here.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.154
- Mmm-hmm.
- <i>I live in Pittsburgh</i>

09:30.240 --> 09:32.716
<i>and I don't have a publisher yet,
but I'm committed and determined...</i>

09:32.840 --> 09:34.559
- Grandmama, mail!
- Oh, my God!

09:34.640 --> 09:36.597
I can't talk to you now.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.074
Mail. Gotta go.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.119
Now listen, uh, you can call me
late Monday afternoon

09:41.200 --> 09:43.590
'cause usually I'm out
running with my grandchildren.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.239
<i>Now, what'd you say your name was?</i>

09:45.320 --> 09:47.073
Rebecca, Rebecca Skloot. You can call me...

09:47.160 --> 09:48.276
Mail!

09:52.000 --> 09:53.480
Deborah?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.040
Deborah? Okay.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.749
<i>Hello?</i>

10:22.840 --> 10:24.911
Deborah, hi. It's Rebecca.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.156
<i>Can't talk.</i>

10:27.240 --> 10:28.594
Oh, well, shall I call back in, say...

10:28.680 --> 10:30.239
Done talking.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.677
My brother say I ought to
write a book myself.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.319
But I ain't no writer.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.319
Can't talk to you.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.790
<i>Why can't you talk to me?</i>

10:42.880 --> 10:45.395
<i>Did somebody... Deborah?</i>

10:45.480 --> 10:47.392
Talk to the men.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.995
Sonny, Lawrence.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.912
Deborah, if you'd just give me a chance,
I can...

10:53.000 --> 10:54.514
We could spend some time together and...

10:54.600 --> 10:56.239
<i>I don't want to get hurt again.</i>

11:08.920 --> 11:13.119
So, I'm here in Baltimore in a parking lot,

11:13.200 --> 11:16.034
waiting for Sonny Lacks to show up

11:16.120 --> 11:19.318
and hopefully take me to introduce me
to the rest of the family.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.189
And I'm really hoping that Deborah might...
Might be there, but...

11:23.280 --> 11:24.430
Oh. That's...

11:24.520 --> 11:25.920
Oh, my God, he's actually here.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.114
Yeah, I told you that I'll be passing.

11:29.880 --> 11:30.870
Hi.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.639
I will be over there. All right, okay, bye.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.632
- Miss Rebecca!
- Hey.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.799
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.077
Uh, you're a very hard man to track down.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.038
I'm a busy man, Miss Rebecca.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.918
- I'm a very busy man.
- That's good.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.912
- No, it's not.
- No?

11:48.900 --> 11:50.469
Here, come on.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.280
Oh. Oh, okay, well, let me just get my stuff.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.835
Is Deborah gonna be there today?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.115
No. Lawrence will check you out.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.470
He'll decide what's what.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.037
- Okay.
- I told you I'm in a meeting.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.952
I'm in my car.
You can have a meeting in the car.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.719
It's a mobile office.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.838
Do you mind if I turn this on,

12:11.960 --> 12:13.076
- so I could...
- No, no.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.914
Go ahead, go ahead.
Trying to find something on the radio.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.998
Your cell phone always ring that much?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.673
Ripping and running, Miss Rebecca.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.836
Ripping and running.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.236
So, what's the earliest memory
you have of your mother?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.352
Well, I hear she was pretty.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.071
Lawrence the only one
old enough to really remember.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.198
Me, Dale, Zakariyya,
we got no memories at all.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.880
Lawrence was a teenager?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.391
Mmm-hmm. He was around 15.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.116
Zakar-ree-ah?

12:48.200 --> 12:49.953
Changed his name in prison.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.391
Good thing he ain't here
to hear you mispronouncing it.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.876
I'm just messing with you.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.677
So, here's where we take
scientists and reporters

13:15.760 --> 13:18.912
who wanna know about our mother
so the whole family can gang up on them.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.033
Now, you seem nice enough,
so I won't go get Zakariyya.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.717
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.392
- Which house exactly does Lawrence live in?
- Good luck.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.920
Hello?

14:06.960 --> 14:08.076
Hello?

14:11.240 --> 14:13.550
Hello? Anybody...

14:17.760 --> 14:19.274
Come on in.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.629
I'm Rebecca. Rebecca Skloot.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.996
Wanna taste the meat I cook?

14:28.080 --> 14:30.879
Now, my wife thinks I cook them too long.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.114
How could I resist?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.431
Uh, Lawrence, do you mind if I...

14:40.480 --> 14:43.440
Sonny was telling me you're the only sibling
who has any memory of your mother...

14:43.520 --> 14:47.992
I blacked out most of my memory
because of the sadness and hurting.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.196
I found this cool thing. Um...

14:54.440 --> 14:57.717
Using techniques that HeLa helped develop,

14:57.800 --> 15:00.759
scientists can now take
a piece of a person's cornea

15:00.840 --> 15:04.072
and grow it in a dish
to help treat blindness.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.833
Imagine that.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.399
Right?

15:08.480 --> 15:10.199
It's a miracle.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.318
- I was hoping I could meet Deborah...
- No, just the men.

15:16.400 --> 15:21.316
My wife, she's a fire dragon
without her morning coffee.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.472
Hmm. Come in the front room
while I take it up.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.196
- Come on.
- Take your time, Daddy.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.749
You like the way she decorate the house?

15:44.880 --> 15:46.758
- Hey, Miss Rebecca!
- Sonny.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.315
- Thank you.
- This is our father.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.119
- Nice to meet you.
- Ma'am.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.475
Lawrence, it's after 2:00.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.438
You're just taking Barbara
her morning coffee?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.751
Miss Rebecca, you better run while you can.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.320
Pay him no mind.

15:58.400 --> 16:02.360
Pops, did you know Mama's cells
gonna make Stevie Wonder see?

16:02.480 --> 16:04.631
Don't surprise me none.

16:04.720 --> 16:08.919
They're not actually being
put into people's eyes, her cells, but, um...

16:09.000 --> 16:14.359
Hey, Pop, Miss Rebecca want to know
everything Dale always asking about.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.193
I'm writing a book about Henrietta,

16:16.280 --> 16:19.637
but what I'm missing is information
about her and her life,

16:19.720 --> 16:23.270
what she liked,
what she liked to do, you know.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.636
She was born in Roanoke?

16:25.720 --> 16:28.280
That's right. Raised in Clover.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.313
Didn't like Baltimore much.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.553
So, every summer
she'd head on down to Clover.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.878
Called herself tending a little tobacco.

16:43.240 --> 16:47.678
Pick it, string it, even after she got sick.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.876
Wow.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.833
And when did you first hear
about your wife's cells and...

16:57.280 --> 17:01.354
Hopkins called, said, "Come on up here,
'cause she died."

17:01.440 --> 17:04.319
They wanted to do an autopsy.

17:04.440 --> 17:09.834
They said, "It'd help your children
in case they come down with cancer."

17:11.520 --> 17:14.398
When I went to claim the body,

17:14.480 --> 17:21.034
none of them doctors told me nothing
about keeping her alive in them tubes.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.190
What'd you expect?

17:22.960 --> 17:26.192
I wouldn't go to Hopkins
to get my toenails cut.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.032
Remember when we were little?

17:28.119 --> 17:30.954
If you were bad,
the old folks would threaten to put you out

17:31.040 --> 17:32.872
so them Hopkins night doctors could get you.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.076
I remember.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.914
Hopkins was known for snatching
black folks, experimenting on them.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.799
You'd be surprised how many people
disappeared in East Baltimore.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.758
They'd snatch them right off the street.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.071
Well, it might be a myth. You never know.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.879
- You know what is a myth?
- Hmm?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.754
Everyone saying Henrietta Lacks
donated them cells.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.837
'Cause she didn't donate nothing.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.640
- Mmm-hmm.
- They took them and didn't ask.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.992
Well, this matters to me,
the story, and why it needs to be told.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.958
If this is something
that's gonna help mankind,

17:59.040 --> 18:03.592
I can't imagine someone not wanting to help,
but be forthright, inform the family.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.240
- Just show a little respect.
- Drop a little note.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.959
- A postcard.
- Something.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.750
Hopkins say they gave them cells away,
but they made millions.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.995
A girlfriend of mine's brother-in-law
worked in a lab over in D.C.

18:17.080 --> 18:21.120
She introduced us, and he said,
"'Lacks'? That's funny.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.431
"For years I've been working
with the cells of this woman

18:23.520 --> 18:26.194
"who died of cervical cancer
named Henrietta Lacks,"

18:26.280 --> 18:29.034
and goes on to explain
how any time he wants more,

18:29.120 --> 18:31.680
all he has to do is order them

18:31.760 --> 18:35.754
from a supplier, like everybody else.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.118
Day has got gangrene. Toes need amputating.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.874
Sonny, a bad heart.
Lawrence, high blood pressure.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.360
And Dale's got...

18:45.440 --> 18:49.195
Run herself into the ground
over all the wrong that's been done.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.637
This family's the only ones
haven't made a dime

18:53.720 --> 18:55.837
off of their own mother's cells.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.070
Hello?

19:11.160 --> 19:13.994
<i>If you're gonna write this book</i>
<i>about my mama and want my help,</i>

19:14.080 --> 19:15.833
<i>first, you got to tell everybody</i>

19:15.920 --> 19:19.880
<i>her name wasn't no Helen Lane</i>
<i>or whatever they sometimes say.</i>

19:19.960 --> 19:23.670
And second, everybody talk
about Henrietta Lacks got four kids.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.399
That ain't right. She got five.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.199
'Cause my sister Elsie got sent away

19:27.280 --> 19:30.079
<i>to that Crownsville place,</i>
<i>and I don't know why.</i>

19:30.160 --> 19:32.470
So, we are not leaving my sister out.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.200
Now, my brother's all upset
'cause everybody come around,

19:35.280 --> 19:38.956
make money off our mama's cells,
but I don't care nothing about that.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.831
What I care about is knowing about my sister
and knowing about my mother.

19:43.920 --> 19:48.119
And you got to promise me no matter what,

19:48.200 --> 19:52.752
you ain't gonna lie
and you ain't gonna keep nothing from me.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.159
I promise.

19:59.920 --> 20:03.231
Well, you better get yourself ready, girl,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.836
'cause you got no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

20:27.880 --> 20:28.916
Hi.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.033
Hi, I'm Rebecca.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.952
- Mmm.
- So nice to meet you finally.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.509
"Finally" is right.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.796
- Finally, finally.
- Can I help you?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.473
No, I'm all right.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.273
"Finally" is good.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.832
Here's my card just in case
anything you need or...

20:53.920 --> 20:57.994
Swore up and down I wasn't gonna talk
to nobody ever again about my mother.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.958
But here I am.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.036
Hope I don't regret this.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.680
You okay?

21:13.440 --> 21:14.669
Do you mind if I start?

21:14.760 --> 21:16.513
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.792
I'm the gray child
'cause I'm the one doing all the worrying...

21:23.240 --> 21:24.754
...about our mother's cells.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.956
Oh, I can only imagine.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.475
Nothing but lies and deceit.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.472
I'm... I'm good, thanks.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.239
But no matter what,

21:32.320 --> 21:35.233
my mother's always been there,
watching out for us.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.471
Look at that salad bar.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.674
So, when you say
your mother's always been there, what...

21:44.760 --> 21:47.878
What you don't understand is

21:47.960 --> 21:49.997
we didn't know nothing about nothing

21:52.640 --> 21:55.109
<i>till that Asian lady from Hopkins showed up.</i>

22:00.880 --> 22:02.917
Daddy, why they want our blood?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.516
They're testing to see
if you got the cancer killed your mama.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.759
Did you know my mama?

22:11.960 --> 22:13.917
No, her cells.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.593
Everybody does.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.752
They've been in outer space,
in a nuclear bomb.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.837
You should be proud.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.991
<i>But she said everybody knows her.</i>

22:24.080 --> 22:25.753
She done been in bombs and outer space.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.435
- Mama's cells have been...
- Now, hush!

22:28.520 --> 22:30.989
We put your mama in the ground
when you was two.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.430
You alive or you dead.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.194
Can't be both.

22:40.880 --> 22:45.432
<i>Finally, somebody did call me back,
asking for more of my blood.</i>

22:47.880 --> 22:50.475
What made my mama sick? What kind of cancer?

22:50.560 --> 22:51.960
Am I gonna get it, too?

22:52.040 --> 22:54.315
And how can she rest in peace if they keep
shooting her up into space like that?

22:54.440 --> 22:57.592
Did she get hurt
when they blew her up in those...

23:01.480 --> 23:03.995
Here is everything you need to know.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.749
And so, they never explained to you
they were looking

23:08.840 --> 23:11.992
for genetic markers specific to your mother?

23:13.240 --> 23:14.674
Keep talking.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.595
After HeLa, scientists figured out
how to grow lots of other cell lines

23:18.680 --> 23:21.559
using these cells
in research and experiments.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.518
Any time HeLa
came in contact with another cell,

23:23.600 --> 23:25.034
it would completely take over.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.396
HeLa was unstoppable.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.872
It was traveling through ventilation systems,
moving from lab to lab.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.077
That's why they wanted samples of your DNA,

23:34.160 --> 23:37.198
so they could tell which cells
had been contaminated by HeLa

23:37.280 --> 23:38.999
and which had not.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.997
Deborah, they weren't testing you for cancer.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.551
They were just using you
and your brothers for research.

23:48.280 --> 23:52.274
So, if it hadn't have been for her cells
causing all of that damage,

23:52.360 --> 23:54.192
they never would have come
knocking on our door?

23:54.280 --> 23:58.877
And what Hopkins done to my mama
never would've started to come out?

24:00.520 --> 24:05.037
Mess with Henrietta
and she sic HeLa on your ass.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.312
I bet you she's here right now,

24:10.400 --> 24:13.074
watching every move you make.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.997
This all I got about my mother's cells.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.879
Went to the market.
Something told me to pick this up.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.880
- Scared me half to death.
- I can understand.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.519
- This is...
- What about this?

24:28.240 --> 24:30.800
And just like Hopkins stole my mama's cells,

24:30.880 --> 24:33.475
this doctor steals a woman's eggs

24:33.560 --> 24:37.395
and cloned an army of little boys
that look just like her dead son.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.994
Deborah, that's just science fiction.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.918
It all sound like science fiction.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.713
Then I started thinking,

24:42.800 --> 24:46.157
"How many people walking around London
looking like my mother?"

24:46.240 --> 24:49.312
Why would there be...
"The cells known as HeLa

24:49.400 --> 24:51.631
"could populate a village with their clones."

24:51.760 --> 24:53.274
They didn't clone her. They cloned her cells.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.159
I wanna learn everything I can
about my mama's cells.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.391
I wanna go to labs, and I wanna meet people.

24:58.480 --> 25:01.154
Every time I think about
what Hopkins did to my mother,

25:01.240 --> 25:04.039
my... My blood just grows cold,
but even one day...

25:04.120 --> 25:10.390
One day, I'm gonna even go to Hopkins
'cause I am tired of wanting to know and...

25:10.480 --> 25:13.359
And... And hiding.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.831
I've been carrying this around
for a long time.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.559
It's a Mother's Day card.

25:18.640 --> 25:23.237
"May the spirit of the Lord
and Savior be with you

25:23.320 --> 25:26.358
"on this day on which you are honored

25:26.440 --> 25:31.356
"for all the love that you have given
your family and your loved ones.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.320
"From your daughter, Deborah."

25:38.080 --> 25:40.072
I have something for you.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.511
They're Henrietta's cells.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.040
It's a gift.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.715
A research doctor at Johns Hopkins.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.276
It's his way of saying thank you to you

26:01.360 --> 26:04.273
for everything
that your mother has done for science.

26:09.720 --> 26:14.840
In vitro fertilization, the AIDS cocktail,
chemotherapy drugs.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.116
Deborah, there isn't a person alive

26:17.200 --> 26:20.193
who hasn't benefited
from your mother's cells.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.313
Who's this?

26:29.680 --> 26:31.956
My big sister Elsie.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.317
Died so young, never knew her.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.640
She was so beautiful.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.200
She's pretty.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.117
Are these your mother's medical records?

26:43.200 --> 26:44.873
- No!
- Oh!

26:45.920 --> 26:48.037
No... I'm so sorry, Deborah.
I wasn't trying to...

26:48.120 --> 26:49.156
That's right, you wasn't.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.077
What you trying to do
with my mama's medical records?

26:52.160 --> 26:53.230
Nothing! Nothing.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.879
I thought you put them there for me.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.917
We are not ready for that!

26:58.040 --> 26:59.872
I wasn't trying to do anything bad at all.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.031
I just wanna learn the story of your mom,
just like you.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.271
Just like Sir Lord. Don't know who to trust.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.350
Deborah! Deborah!

27:37.920 --> 27:42.119
Got a phone call
this morning from my brother Zakariyya.

27:42.200 --> 27:45.796
You know, things ain't been so good for him
since he got out of jail,

27:45.880 --> 27:48.998
but I'm pretty sure he about ready
to start talking about our mother again.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.673
So, you're pretty sure?

27:50.760 --> 27:54.356
Long as we get there
before he start drinking, you'll be fine.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.557
Boys!

28:00.080 --> 28:05.439
I don't want y'all running off
all around here anyway, okay? Mmm-hmm.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.560
There he is.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.319
Hey, Zakariyya.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.351
Said you were gonna be here in an hour!

28:19.440 --> 28:22.035
Didn't wanna be late, so we left early.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.554
I'm not ready!

28:23.680 --> 28:25.637
Well, take your time.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.030
Goddamn kids!

28:30.120 --> 28:31.679
Listen, I'm gonna be right up there...

28:31.760 --> 28:33.035
- Where?
- In that window.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.874
If anything get funny, just wave.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.520
Boys, come over here. Let's go.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.634
Hi. I'm Rebecca.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.160
Dale said you had some magazine.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.435
Yes. Yeah.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.752
This is an article I wrote on your mother.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.514
- Do you mind if I...
- You work for Hopkins?

29:04.600 --> 29:06.956
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They just published the article.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.076
I work for myself.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.072
Over here.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.752
- My hearing.
- Sorry.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.993
I guess I don't count.
Sonny not the youngest.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.037
No, I didn't do the captions at all,
like I say there...

29:26.160 --> 29:28.595
Got a couple of dummies for brothers.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.911
Don't have enough sense to spit.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.277
My father buried my mother
in an unmarked grave,

29:34.360 --> 29:37.797
and when that fool die,
I don't wanna know where he buried either.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.676
He need a ride to the hospital,
he can take a cab.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.358
I used to go there.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.999
To Johns Hopkins?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.275
I needed money.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.317
Checked myself into this program.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.639
A research program?

30:00.720 --> 30:03.918
One time, paid me money
just to watch me sleep.

30:04.400 --> 30:09.634
Another time, I needed new eyeglasses,
so I let them test this drug.

30:09.720 --> 30:14.033
If they'd have known I was Henrietta's son,
who knows what they'd do?

30:14.120 --> 30:18.558
She was sick when she was
pregnant with you, right?

30:18.640 --> 30:22.600
I figure I had to start fighting
before I was born.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.558
They say her cells all this and that.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.474
Didn't do her no good.
Didn't do any of us any good.

30:27.560 --> 30:31.236
I hope that George Gray is burning in hell.

30:31.320 --> 30:34.279
- His name's actually George Gey...
- Who cares what his name is,

30:34.360 --> 30:35.840
what he did was wrong!

30:35.920 --> 30:37.832
God handles that!

30:37.920 --> 30:41.596
God wanna have a disease cure,
He provide one for Himself!

30:41.680 --> 30:43.160
You don't mess with that!

30:43.240 --> 30:46.631
You don't lie and clone people
behind their back!

30:46.720 --> 30:49.679
If he was here, I would kill him dead.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.116
Stick a black pitchfork up his ass.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.592
Y'all done reporting?

30:59.560 --> 31:02.519
Me and Zakariyya, we a lot alike.

31:04.680 --> 31:09.709
We can't go shutting our feelings on and off
just like everybody else.

31:09.800 --> 31:14.750
Once something's done, it stays inside.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.634
Don't go away.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.715
Come on.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.360
Come on and walk us back to the car.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.793
"Welcome to Clover!"

32:09.560 --> 32:11.040
I feel welcome.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.790
Looks like somebody went out for lunch

32:18.880 --> 32:21.714
a couple of decades ago
and forgot to come back.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.518
How you doing?

32:29.200 --> 32:31.795
- Your muffler! Your muffler!
- What?

32:31.880 --> 32:33.837
Oh, yes. Thank you, sir.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.276
I got it. Muffler.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.114
<i>Let's see if you and that tape recorder</i>

32:44.200 --> 32:46.032
<i>can get my mama's family to talk.</i>

32:46.120 --> 32:48.316
<i>So, Gladys is Henrietta's sister.</i>

32:48.400 --> 32:52.679
<i>And Aunt Sadie is her cousin and
best friend from when they were girls.</i>

32:58.160 --> 32:59.594
Whoo!

32:59.680 --> 33:02.320
Looky here, looky here!

33:04.800 --> 33:05.836
Miss Sadie!

33:05.960 --> 33:08.634
Oh, Deborah, so good to see you!

33:09.600 --> 33:11.831
And there's Cousin Cootie over there!

33:11.920 --> 33:13.798
Cousin Cootie over there! Ooh!

33:14.720 --> 33:16.473
- Cousin!
- Cousin Cliff, Cousin Cliff.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.676
It's good to see you.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.390
- Y'all meet my reporter.
- Hello!

33:21.520 --> 33:23.796
- Good to see you.
- Look at Aunt Gladys up here!

33:23.880 --> 33:26.315
How you doing, Aunt Gladys?

33:26.440 --> 33:28.397
Aunt Gladys, how you doing?

33:28.480 --> 33:31.393
How you doing? Nice to see you.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.836
- Come on in the house.
- Nice and cool.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.476
Just so I don't miss anything.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.196
Mmm.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.474
So, how long did you know Henrietta for?

33:45.560 --> 33:50.555
We don't believe in
telling stories on the dead.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.156
I hear she was a very nice person.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.516
A very good-conditioned person.

33:59.640 --> 34:00.915
Pretty teeth.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.277
So, what else can you tell me about her?

34:11.280 --> 34:12.509
Well...

34:27.760 --> 34:30.400
Hennie made the good come out of you.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.072
She made life come alive.

34:34.159 --> 34:39.393
Every year, a carnival would come to town
and we'd ride the Ferris wheel.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.920
And when our car stopped at the top...

34:44.600 --> 34:47.274
We'd scream, just scream!

34:47.360 --> 34:49.272
Cootie, when did you move to Turner Station?

34:49.360 --> 34:51.033
December 1942.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.315
If the Japanese ain't attacked,

34:53.400 --> 34:56.598
colored never would've had jobs
over there at Bethlehem Steel.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.400
- That's right.
- Day used to work the night shift,

34:59.480 --> 35:03.520
so around 11:00, me and Hennie
would sneak over to the Twin Pines.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.320
Amos Milburn playing on the box.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.595
<i>Down the Road.</i>

35:08.640 --> 35:10.757
Me and Hennie would swing out heavy!

35:10.840 --> 35:12.718
Swinging out heavy!

35:12.800 --> 35:14.712
Two-step across the floor.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.155
Whoo!

35:26.360 --> 35:27.510
Yeah, Sadie!

35:29.160 --> 35:30.719
Whoo! Spin her!

35:32.640 --> 35:35.553
Come on, y'all! Dance, y'all!

35:43.760 --> 35:46.480
And when all her cousins moved from down here

35:46.560 --> 35:48.791
to Turner Station,
Hennie'd take care of them.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.678
Okay, now, which cousin are you?

35:50.760 --> 35:52.991
- Uh, Cousin Fred, ma'am...
- Don't call me "ma'am."

35:53.080 --> 35:54.639
- I'm too young to be anybody's ma'am.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.632
Call me Henrietta. Bring me your plate.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.474
<i>Half of them fools wasn't even a relation,</i>

35:59.560 --> 36:01.711
<i>but she'd feed 'em just the same.</i>

36:01.800 --> 36:03.917
Everybody up in here family.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.480
Make sure you have enough.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.035
<i>She always kept herself real pretty.</i>

36:08.120 --> 36:10.191
Oh, Lord! Day done lost his mind.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.839
Oh, you looking good, baby.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.276
<i>Fingers and toenails painted red.</i>

36:16.080 --> 36:19.994
Now, Cousin Billy
is the best carpenter 'sides Jesus himself.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.594
Ain't that right, Cousin Billy?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.353
- Well, I guess.
- "I guess"?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.909
If you be it, say it. Ain't that right?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.753
- That's right.
- Okay, girl.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.194
Go on over there.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.632
That's the way your mother was.

36:38.720 --> 36:39.836
What all did she cook?

36:39.920 --> 36:41.593
- Rice pudding.
- Oh, yeah.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.473
- Slow-cooked greens.
- Oh, yes.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.040
Neck bone.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.476
Henrietta

36:47.600 --> 36:49.910
no neck bones.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.359
Neck bones me!

36:55.520 --> 36:57.830
Put that in your tape recorder!

36:57.920 --> 37:00.037
Thank you, Aunt Gladys! Thank you!

37:00.760 --> 37:03.719
- Me.
- You! Okay. I got it!

37:06.960 --> 37:09.520
Henrietta took care of me
when my polio got bad.

37:09.600 --> 37:13.719
That's why she used her cells
to help get rid of it for other folk.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.757
One thing I'll never forget,

37:15.840 --> 37:18.400
when word spread that Henrietta was sick,

37:18.480 --> 37:21.473
every man who could walk,
and a few who couldn't,

37:21.560 --> 37:23.199
made their way to Hopkins.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.714
I'm here to give blood in case she needs it.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.318
- It's got dirt and straw floors.
- Wood underneath.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.994
When was this built?

38:35.080 --> 38:36.230
During slavery.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.836
But ain't nobody lived here
for 35, 40 years since your mama.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.800
<i>I think about you all the time, Mama.</i>

39:40.960 --> 39:43.600
<i>I wish I could see you</i>
<i>and hold you in my arms</i>

39:43.680 --> 39:45.478
<i>the way I know you held me.</i>

39:47.920 --> 39:50.310
<i>'Cause I know I'm a part of you, and...</i>

39:51.560 --> 39:53.472
<i>And you're part of me.</i>

40:02.040 --> 40:04.760
Henrietta's buried over there somewhere.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.836
Better get your snake stick.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.566
"Snake stick"?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.794
If I see a snake, I'm hiding behind you.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.634
Sometimes they be hiding in the trees.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.111
Snakes don't really hide in any trees.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.833
Look for your grandmother's tombstone.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.835
She's joking about the snakes
in trees, right?

40:37.080 --> 40:40.198
Oh! There she is.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.636
Eliza Pleasant.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.872
Oh. So, Henrietta was only four
when she died.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.474
She lost her mama young just like me.

40:52.360 --> 40:56.513
Henrietta is buried
in one of these unmarked graves.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.154
Elsie, too.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.632
Elsie was one pretty little girl.

41:29.720 --> 41:33.475
Stare at you with those sad brown eyes,

41:33.560 --> 41:38.237
hands a-waving, cawing like a bird.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.915
Couldn't do a thing for herself.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.118
Hennie had to feed her, bathe her.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.554
Had Day driving to every tent show
so preachers could lay hands on her.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.076
Nothing helped.

41:54.160 --> 41:59.952
This one time, Elsie run smack dead
in the middle of traffic.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.674
Scared Hennie half to death.

42:03.760 --> 42:07.549
What was it that made Henrietta
finally send her to Crownsville?

42:09.040 --> 42:12.511
It was more than she could handle.

42:12.600 --> 42:17.231
You and Sonny were just babies,
little Zakariyya on the way.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.835
She fought against it till she couldn't.

42:24.800 --> 42:30.114
The day she sent Elsie to Crownsville,
Hennie liked to die.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.397
<i>Last night when I got back</i>
<i>to the motel, oh, my God!</i>

42:49.480 --> 42:51.700
Ticks up and down my legs.

42:52.280 --> 42:53.396
What's that right there?

42:53.480 --> 42:55.312
I don't... Oh!

42:55.400 --> 42:56.834
Oh, my God.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.119
I'm done with you.

43:01.560 --> 43:04.598
Okay, well,
I'm gonna start sending you articles...

43:04.680 --> 43:05.716
Yeah.

43:05.800 --> 43:09.430
...and essays and everything
that I discover along the way,

43:09.520 --> 43:11.159
I want you to know about it as well.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.072
- Send them. Send them all.
- Okay.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.117
And once
I've done some writing and find an editor,

43:15.200 --> 43:16.759
I'm gonna be ready to hit the road again.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.752
- Count me in.
- Really?

43:18.840 --> 43:21.230
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.154
When the time is right,
we need to go to Crownsville.

43:24.240 --> 43:25.720
And get yourself a cell phone.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.917
You shouldn't be
on them back roads without a phone.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.760
- All right.
- All right.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.559
Get this muffler fixed, too!

43:32.640 --> 43:34.472
It's embarrassing!

43:45.040 --> 43:48.954
<i>"There's a photo on my wall</i>
<i>of a woman I never met,</i>

43:49.040 --> 43:52.954
<i>"its left corner torn</i>
<i>and patched together with tape.</i>

43:59.280 --> 44:01.317
<i>They're not saying Henrietta wasn't human.</i>

44:01.400 --> 44:02.880
Sure sound like it to me.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.190
<i>But that her cells have,</i>
<i>over time, changed so much,</i>

44:06.280 --> 44:08.237
<i>it's as if they're their own species now.</i>

44:08.320 --> 44:13.270
<i>And the long one is about how HeLa cells</i>
<i>made it possible to do stem cell research.</i>

44:13.360 --> 44:15.431
Go, HeLa! Go, HeLa!

44:15.520 --> 44:17.034
That's my mother.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.392
<i>Working on HeLa</i>
<i>was the highlight of my career.</i>

44:22.480 --> 44:27.316
When Dr. McKusick said,
"Go get this blood drawn," I did.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.357
Were you aware that the Lackses thought

44:29.440 --> 44:31.113
that you were testing them for cancer?

44:31.200 --> 44:34.910
I suspect there was no effort
to explain anything in great detail.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.232
It's not like those people
would have understood anyway.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.875
- <i>I was shocked.</i>
- <i>I don't know why.</i>

44:40.960 --> 44:43.191
<i>They see me coming, they lock the door.</i>

44:43.280 --> 44:45.795
<i>They see you coming,</i>
<i>it's, "Rebecca, come on in."</i>

44:45.880 --> 44:48.270
<i>They'll say things they wouldn't say,</i>
<i>at least to my face.</i>

44:48.360 --> 44:51.751
So, go ahead on, girl, keep on being white.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.952
<i>Good news. I found a publisher for the book.</i>

44:56.040 --> 44:59.033
'Course you did.
That's my mother paving the way.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.033
<i>You mind asking her
to pave it a little faster?</i>

45:02.120 --> 45:03.873
Ask her yourself.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.634
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:06.720 --> 45:09.030
- Rebecca. Hey.
- Hi.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.271
- Sorry I'm a bit late.
- No problem.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.992
And you know I'm sincere
when I say you're a great writer.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.594
- "But..."
- But...

45:19.640 --> 45:21.871
We got a bit of a problem.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.872
The family.

45:23.960 --> 45:25.872
What about them?

45:25.960 --> 45:27.553
The mentally damaged daughter.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.838
Well, that's very poignant
and essential about Elsie...

45:30.920 --> 45:32.559
The indigent ex-con brother.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.518
Zakariyya actually spent
the first year of his life

45:34.600 --> 45:36.637
- in an incubator...
- The manic-depressive daughter

45:36.720 --> 45:38.677
with, what, 27 different kinds of ailments?

45:38.760 --> 45:40.399
The story of Henrietta is about legacy.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.392
- Right.
- It's cultural, personal, racial.

45:42.480 --> 45:44.437
- We got a contract.
- And it's about this family...

45:44.520 --> 45:46.239
- I jotted down a few notes.
- ...who has lost their mother,

45:46.320 --> 45:47.390
and the world that got HeLa.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.472
Eliminate the family and keep writing.

45:52.200 --> 45:53.270
<i>Rebecca?</i>

45:53.360 --> 45:55.317
<i>Sasha Walz, Danbury Publishing.</i>

45:55.440 --> 45:57.033
<i>We have a bit of a situation.</i>

45:57.120 --> 45:58.679
<i>What kind of situation?</i>

45:58.760 --> 46:02.151
<i>A PATH train Bill was on</i>
<i>overshot the platform.</i>

46:02.280 --> 46:04.875
<i>Bill fell and suffered a concussion.</i>

46:04.960 --> 46:07.714
<i>He's experiencing a temporary loss of memory.</i>

46:07.800 --> 46:10.713
<i>I see on his calendar you two met last week.</i>

46:10.800 --> 46:13.440
<i>Do you remember what you talked about?</i>

46:13.520 --> 46:17.275
Well, as a matter of fact, he wasn't exactly
happy with how the book was going,

46:17.360 --> 46:20.558
so we had mutually agreed to part ways.

46:22.040 --> 46:25.232
That's what happens when you try
and take her children out of a book.

46:25.320 --> 46:28.358
Henrietta throw your ass off a train.

46:28.440 --> 46:29.635
Deborah!

46:29.720 --> 46:31.871
<i>Everywhere. She everywhere.</i>

46:44.720 --> 46:47.838
<i>"She filled her bathtub,</i>
<i>lowered herself into the warm water,</i>

46:47.920 --> 46:50.071
<i>"and slowly spread her legs.</i>

46:58.640 --> 47:00.279
"a hard lump."

47:05.280 --> 47:07.920
What time tomorrow should I get here?

47:09.200 --> 47:10.554
I didn't ask you, I was asking her.

47:10.680 --> 47:12.831
- Sonny.
- I'm speaking for her.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.559
- Sonny.
- Hmm?

47:14.640 --> 47:17.235
Wait till you see this picture
I got of our mother's cells.

47:17.320 --> 47:20.916
This cancer scientist that Rebecca knows
over at Hopkins gave it to me.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.150
Mmm-hmm?

47:22.240 --> 47:24.596
He wants us to come see
our mother's real cells.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.150
And you gonna go?

47:30.200 --> 47:32.237
I'm thinking about it.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.596
Hopkins lies to us.

47:34.680 --> 47:38.594
Hopkins deceives us, takes and steals
and tells us nothing.

47:38.680 --> 47:40.751
And then all of a sudden, Rebecca comes along

47:40.840 --> 47:44.516
and you choosing her,
choosing Hopkins over your own family.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.990
- Why you attacking me?
- 'Cause you need to stop.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.878
- Lawrence.
- Just 'cause you wanna go running around

47:48.960 --> 47:52.158
digging up graves, don't mean the rest of us
gotta go along for the ride.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.560
Now, Barbara and I have always protected you.

47:55.640 --> 47:56.915
And I'm grateful for all that.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.276
- When you were pregnant with Alfred...
- Lawrence.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.238
There's many a day
the only thing kept me going

48:01.320 --> 48:04.119
was knowing my mama loved
and missed me as much as I miss her.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.669
- Making sure you stayed...
- I ain't stopping.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.274
- I am not stopping!
- Deb,

48:08.360 --> 48:12.240
Lawrence is gonna keep getting upset,
and Dale is gonna do what she wants,

48:12.320 --> 48:14.630
- like Dale always does.
- You don't remember!

48:14.720 --> 48:17.189
- Go ahead.
- How thin she got,

48:17.280 --> 48:21.320
how whatever they put up in her
burned her inside and out!

48:26.000 --> 48:29.960
Dale, baby, why do you think
Gey used "Helen Lane"

48:30.040 --> 48:31.269
instead of "Henrietta Lacks"?

48:32.480 --> 48:33.960
Becca showed me the papers

48:34.040 --> 48:36.760
where he wanted to use her name,
but the lawyers...

48:36.840 --> 48:40.117
And Hopkins made
all that money off of our mother!

48:40.200 --> 48:41.953
Hopkins ain't made a dime!

48:42.040 --> 48:44.111
Rebecca's saying whatever
Hopkins wants her to say,

48:44.200 --> 48:45.873
and you dumb enough to believe her.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.474
I'm gonna go check on Davon.

48:47.560 --> 48:48.994
Dale, Dale.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.912
All those trips the two
of you take, who pays?

48:53.600 --> 48:56.274
Thank you, Barbara.
It was a very lovely meal.

48:56.360 --> 49:00.798
Once they get what they want,
they're gonna leave you to die.

49:01.760 --> 49:03.797
Just like they did Mama.

49:11.760 --> 49:14.798
Oh, hi. I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

49:14.880 --> 49:19.636
Remember that first time we talked,
and I didn't wanna see you?

49:19.720 --> 49:22.280
- Yeah.
- Who told you to go down to Clover?

49:24.120 --> 49:25.474
Sonny.

49:25.560 --> 49:28.120
And Dr. Pattillo. And I had read it in...

49:28.200 --> 49:31.159
Sonny didn't mention that to me.
I don't know, Rebecca.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.636
I'm not doing anything
behind your back, I swear.

49:33.720 --> 49:38.715
Well, this card of yours say you a freelance
science, medical writer and editor,

49:38.800 --> 49:41.554
and you say you're doing
all this on your own.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.154
So, I don't know about that.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.993
Freelance just means that I work for myself.

49:45.080 --> 49:48.596
I know what it means,
but everybody got somebody backing them.

49:48.680 --> 49:50.911
Nobody have the money to do
all these things you're doing,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.640
your traveling and your... Your recording...

49:53.760 --> 49:56.719
Deborah, I swear,
I haven't gotten a penny from anyone.

49:56.800 --> 50:01.158
So, let's talk about this book you wanna
write, which is all fine and good,

50:01.240 --> 50:04.074
but where's the funding in there
for the family?

50:04.160 --> 50:06.311
- I don't have any funding.
- And you ain't offered none neither.

50:06.440 --> 50:08.511
I can't offer you something
that I don't have.

50:08.600 --> 50:10.080
I told you I wanna start that foundation.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.038
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

50:12.120 --> 50:13.349
- The book!
- What?

50:13.440 --> 50:16.194
You said you turned it in!
So, where is the book?

50:16.280 --> 50:18.078
- There's no book yet.
- Where is the book?

50:18.200 --> 50:20.635
I said where is the book?

50:20.720 --> 50:23.189
- Is it for sale already out there?
- Deborah! Deborah!

50:23.280 --> 50:25.875
And you making money off of my family
like everybody else?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.992
- Where is the book?
- Look, here, here, here!

50:28.080 --> 50:30.993
MasterCard, Visa, $2,000 past due.

50:31.080 --> 50:32.275
Travel expense report.

50:32.360 --> 50:35.876
I write cheesy articles
to pay for our rooms and gas.

50:35.960 --> 50:39.351
Checking account. $87 in my checking account.

50:39.440 --> 50:42.911
Okay? Deborah, I swear to you, honest to God,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.640
no one's given me any money.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.800
Before you called that first time, well,

50:59.480 --> 51:02.712
this Alabama snake entered our lives.

51:06.320 --> 51:10.633
Sir Lord Keenan Kester Cofield, Esquire.

51:10.800 --> 51:13.440
And you are?

51:13.520 --> 51:17.400
A corrective to all that ails.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.678
And in no time,
he had everybody cheering him on.

51:20.840 --> 51:23.594
We can all lift up our heads

51:23.680 --> 51:29.074
with the knowledge that Henrietta Lacks
helped cure polio.

51:29.160 --> 51:31.391
- That's right.
- But the fact remains,

51:31.480 --> 51:37.795
Johns Hopkins Hospital is guilty
of medical grand larceny.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.520
Ooh! I've been saying that.
Haven't I been saying that?

51:40.600 --> 51:44.116
- That's right. Yeah!
- And somebody's going to pay.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.759
After dealing with Johns Hopkins,

51:45.960 --> 51:48.919
I'm walking over to the office
of every biotech CEO

51:49.320 --> 51:52.199
and demanding reparations to the tune

51:53.600 --> 51:57.116
of $60 million.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.231
Lord have mercy!

52:04.320 --> 52:09.076
Hard not to get caught up in hope
when you been powerless for so long.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.675
And then, guess who called.

52:11.800 --> 52:15.032
<i>Richard Wilson, attorney
with Johns Hopkins Hospital.</i>

52:15.120 --> 52:19.797
<i>I'm calling regarding Sir Lord Cofield,</i>
<i>whom you should know is not a lawyer.</i>

52:19.880 --> 52:21.473
Deborah, no.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.995
...<i>incarcerated in Alabama.</i>

52:24.080 --> 52:28.199
<i>Since his release, Mr. Cofield</i>
<i>has been masquerading as an attorney.</i>

52:28.280 --> 52:30.749
Suing everybody left and right.

52:30.840 --> 52:34.038
Burger King for cooking
their French fries in pork fat

52:34.120 --> 52:36.874
and the <i>Chattanooga Times</i>
for printing my obituary.

52:36.960 --> 52:40.032
Which he wrote and submitted hisself!

52:40.240 --> 52:42.755
<i>The main reason I'm calling is last week,</i>

52:42.840 --> 52:44.354
<i>Mr. Cofield was here at the hospital</i>

52:44.440 --> 52:47.239
<i>demanding a copy of your</i>
<i>mother's medical records.</i>

52:48.760 --> 52:51.195
I will walk through fire

52:51.280 --> 52:54.796
before I let you touch
anything belonging to my mother.

52:56.680 --> 52:58.114
Gal,

53:01.600 --> 53:05.230
you ain't the only one ain't scared of fire.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.233
<i>Just like that,</i>

53:09.320 --> 53:13.712
<i>Mr. Corrective To All That Ails</i>
<i>set out to do us in.</i>

53:13.960 --> 53:20.070
He sued everybody, sued Hopkins, sued me,
Lawrence, Sonny, Barbara.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.959
Every day, another summons.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.793
Child, I was a mess.

53:26.640 --> 53:31.760
<i>Then one day, I'm home by myself,</i>
<i>another one of Sir Lord's summonses.</i>

53:37.040 --> 53:41.990
<i>I knew she died when she was 15,</i>
<i>but not in that place.</i>

53:42.080 --> 53:44.800
<i>Just to think about her in there all alone...</i>

53:48.520 --> 53:51.513
<i>In the same summons,</i>
<i>he wrote about this book.</i>

53:53.400 --> 53:58.600
<i>When I saw my mama's picture</i>
<i>and read her autopsy report,</i>

54:00.320 --> 54:02.357
my nerves just broke.

54:03.840 --> 54:07.436
They took me to
every doctor and psychiatrist,

54:07.520 --> 54:10.513
and, you name it, they said I had it.

54:10.640 --> 54:15.157
<i>Paranoia, schizophrenia, anxiety.</i>

54:18.480 --> 54:19.675
Dale.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.353
<i>All I know is, when I...</i>

54:21.440 --> 54:24.274
<i>When I get in that mood and I get frightened,</i>

54:26.200 --> 54:29.637
I just... I just... I wanna hide.

54:30.360 --> 54:32.920
And this all happened...

54:33.040 --> 54:35.077
Just before you called.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.038
Oh, my... Wow.

54:37.640 --> 54:41.395
My mama's medical records is...

54:41.480 --> 54:43.153
It's all I have.

54:45.760 --> 54:49.037
The only thing I have
that don't nobody else have.

54:52.520 --> 54:55.877
When the time is right, I'll share them.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.795
But I get to say when that is.

55:21.400 --> 55:24.916
<i>Elsie, I'm coming to find out</i>
<i>about you and take you home.</i>

55:34.040 --> 55:35.076
You ready?

55:44.040 --> 55:45.235
Hmm.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.592
Where is everybody?

55:50.320 --> 55:52.710
- Hello?
- Well, let's see.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.598
Maybe something down here.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.520
Oh. There it is.

56:07.440 --> 56:08.635
Hmm.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.354
What the hell?

56:22.480 --> 56:23.880
Hello!

56:23.960 --> 56:24.996
Anybody here?

56:25.080 --> 56:28.790
- Hello?
- Hello? Somebody come help us!

56:28.880 --> 56:31.793
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for my sister.

56:31.880 --> 56:35.157
Uh, could you tell me
what this is in reference to?

56:35.240 --> 56:37.232
Guess I just got invisible.

56:37.320 --> 56:41.553
My sister was a patient here
till she got killed in 1955,

56:41.640 --> 56:45.236
so I'd appreciate it if you would point us
in the direction of her files

56:45.320 --> 56:48.392
'cause that door over there
say "medical records,"

56:48.480 --> 56:50.472
but they ain't nowhere to be found.

56:51.640 --> 56:54.519
What was your sister's name?

56:56.720 --> 57:00.509
Was Crownsville always
predominantly African-American?

57:00.880 --> 57:03.031
- Um, until '63.
- Mmm-hmm.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.191
You'll have to be prepared.

57:05.280 --> 57:09.240
Sometimes learning
is just as painful as not knowing.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.238
That's why I always say to my brothers,

57:11.320 --> 57:14.074
"You gonna go into history,
can't have no hate attitude."

57:14.200 --> 57:15.759
- I am ready.
- All right.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.433
I've been ready.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.593
Uh, here.

57:19.680 --> 57:23.959
I'm afraid that Crownsville
was not a very nice place to be back then.

57:27.200 --> 57:29.351
Let me see.

57:29.440 --> 57:31.671
No holding back.

57:42.040 --> 57:44.794
We had a serious asbestos problem.

57:44.880 --> 57:45.870
Here we go.

57:46.600 --> 57:48.512
You know,

57:48.600 --> 57:54.073
of all the thousands upon thousands
of autopsy reports,

57:54.160 --> 57:56.038
- this is all that remains.
- Wow.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.435
The year she died?

57:57.520 --> 57:58.556
1955.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.474
19... 1955...

58:01.560 --> 58:05.031
No, 1940... '45.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.356
- Incredible.
- Wow.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.114
- 1955.
- Oh, my goodness. Wow.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.839
Um, her full name?

58:11.920 --> 58:14.435
- Elsie. Elsie Lacks.
- Sure.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.671
- Her name was Elsie?
- Elsie Lacks.

58:16.760 --> 58:19.673
Elsie Lacks. Elsie...

58:22.040 --> 58:23.269
Oh, my goodness, there she is!

58:23.640 --> 58:24.676
Oh!

58:24.760 --> 58:26.353
Oh, my goodness!

58:26.480 --> 58:28.915
- Oh, my gosh!
- Jesus!

58:29.000 --> 58:30.354
- Oh, my gosh!
- Whoo!

58:30.440 --> 58:32.352
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

58:32.440 --> 58:34.352
I can't tell you how impossible this is.

58:34.440 --> 58:36.079
Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Lord.

58:36.200 --> 58:38.760
- I found my sister!
- Oh, my God.

58:42.280 --> 58:45.671
I have never seen a picture
in one of these reports before, it's...

58:45.760 --> 58:47.638
Let me see. Let me see.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.669
Why they holding her neck like that?

58:59.760 --> 59:02.355
They shouldn't be holding her neck like that.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.034
What are they doing here?

59:05.120 --> 59:07.555
Stop taking notes and put
that document down now.

59:07.640 --> 59:10.314
This is the family of a former patient!

59:10.440 --> 59:12.477
My birth certificate.

59:12.560 --> 59:16.713
My sister's birth certificate
and power of attorney.

59:16.800 --> 59:20.919
Now get me a copy
of my sister's records and her picture

59:21.000 --> 59:23.356
so we can get on out of here.

59:30.160 --> 59:31.992
How are you feeling?

59:32.080 --> 59:34.675
Time to take my sister back to Clover.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.237
This is my mother. This is my mother.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.039
She in history 'cause of her cells.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.277
This is my sister.
We just found my sister today.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.714
Now, look. She a little puffy
around the eyes.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.634
- Deborah! Deborah!
- She had been crying 'cause couldn't find me.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.473
- Oh, this my reporter. This my reporter.
- Hey.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.676
- We on our way to Clover.
- Hey.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.319
- You ever been to Clover?
- Deborah, hey.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.629
You ever been to Clover?
You need to go to Clover!

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.473
- Deborah. Listen.
- Bye!

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.279
Come here. I have to talk to you.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.920
I'm... I'm tired. You're tired.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.435
Why don't we go to the motel now, check in,

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.399
and then we can
drive to Clover in the morning?

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.034
Let's do that.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.038
Here you go, my mama's records.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.796
Are you sure?

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.872
Knock yourself out.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.193
I'm going to bed.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.760
I'm not going to bed.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.471
Let's get busy.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.631
What you got?

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.791
Okay.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.793
"Twenty-eight-year-old woman.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.635
"Rh-positive, November 2, 1949."

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.799
This is three days before you were born.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.917
Let me see.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.432
"August 8, 1951.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.675
"Tubes filled with radium were placed
inside the cervix and sewn into..."

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.911
Let me see that. Let me see that.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.995
Why don't we...
Why don't we call the front desk

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.390
and see if there's a Kinko's nearby?

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.516
Why?

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.513
There's over 100 pages here,
and some are in really bad condition,

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.359
and there's just no way

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.830
that we're gonna be able to
read them all and take notes tonight.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.037
I can read.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.839
And you can take notes.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.391
"August 8, 1951.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.199
"Thirty-year-old colored woman.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.073
"Cervical biopsy."

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.117
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Can I see...

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.279
Oh, my God, this could be
when Johns Hopkins first took a sample.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.199
Enough about Hopkins!

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.077
"Lucille Elsie Lacks.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.277
"Pneumo..."

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.993
"Encephalography.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.556
"To prevent brain fluid blurring X-rays,
doctors would drill holes into skulls

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.997
"and drain the fluid out
and pump air into the brain."

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.678
Deborah, are you okay?

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.239
"Elsie Lacks, 10 years old.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.118
"January 20th."

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.432
Deborah, you were only two months old when...

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.318
Turn that off.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.556
I do not want you putting that in the book.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.034
I don't want you putting that in the book!

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.352
- I won't, I promise.
- You smiling 'cause you're lying.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.956
No, I'm smiling because I think it's very sweet
that you wanna protect your sister.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.360
That's why I'm smiling.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.669
- I'm sorry.
- Who's paying you?

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.955
- What?
- Who you working for?

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.315
We've been through this before.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.834
- I told you that...
- Who's paying you?

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.435
- Who's paying for this room?
- I told you I'm working...

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.476
- ...at Johns Hopkins! Johns Hopkins!
- I told you before...

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.598
Get the fuck off me! Get off me!

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.440
Jesus Christ, how many times
do I have to tell you

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.954
I'm working for myself?

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.520
I'm not working for Johns Hopkins!

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.273
I'm not Sir Lord!

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.079
If you don't trust me
after everything we've been through,

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.152
you can go fuck yourself!

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.078
I was all anxious last night.
Took me an Ambien.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.355
Painted my nails.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.233
I did a horrible job.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.836
Continental breakfast, 99 cent.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.551
Save you some money.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.393
Deborah, I...

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.278
We a mess, girl.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.438
But you gotta promise me something.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.631
You can't let me and nobody else
keep you from writing this book.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.913
And all that happened last night,
all that's gotta go in there, too.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.959
No, no, no, I'm not putting
myself in the book.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.760
Well, I'm not gonna be in there by myself.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.639
It's all a part of the story now.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.599
We okay, boo?

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.751
Are you... Are you okay? What...

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.832
I get this way sometime.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.352
You wanna ride with me?

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.115
I've been thinking about
copyrighting my mama's signature

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.953
so can't nobody steal it,

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.397
then I'm gonna set up a webpage
and have people do donations,

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.153
and then I'm gonna use them donations.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.072
I'm gonna get a monument
and I'm gonna put it on her grave.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.800
And then I'm gonna turn the Home House...

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.111
I'm gonna turn the Home House into a museum.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.634
I think we should find a doctor.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.632
I think that these don't look like
they're clearing up.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.519
- I think we should pull over...
- Nothing a Benadryl won't fix up.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.795
Here, open this for me.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.156
And inside... I've been thinking about it.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.795
Inside I'm gonna put a wax figure of her,

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.793
of my mother, and then
I'm gonna put a wax figure,

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.078
and then some of her cells,

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.231
and then I'm gonna have
people come and watch them multiply.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.875
Come on, bring your camera.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.713
Deborah, slow down. Deborah?

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.834
Take a picture of me and my sister.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.838
Now, the three of us on my mother's grave.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.330
Hurry, hurry. Weather not looking good.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.389
This is the only time
the three of us gonna be together.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.991
Okay, listen to me. Let's go back to the car.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.754
I think... I think this is...

01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.549
Deborah?

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.230
Deborah?

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.154
<i>Lawrence stayed away.</i>

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.277
<i>Didn't wanna see my mother put in the ground.</i>

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.395
These welts, these welts don't mean nothing

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:21.473
compared to the welts
up and down Zakariyya's back.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.073
Evil Aunt Ethel,
who my daddy had take care of us

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.390
after our mother died, she hated us.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.716
<i>Daddy busy working, nobody looking.</i>

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.276
<i>She hated us!</i>

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.591
<i>But she saved a special hate</i>

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.514
<i>for little Zakariyya, a special hate for him.</i>

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.716
Sometimes in the middle
of the night for no reason,

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.560
<i>she would stand him</i>
<i>in the corner in the basement,</i>

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.312
and she would... She would beat, and beat,

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.319
and beat, the love out of him.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.040
So, this hurt...

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.756
This hurt ain't nothing compared to Galen,

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:02.716
<i>Aunt Ethel's husband, when I turned 15...</i>

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.551
- Stop.
- Shh!

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.029
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Shh!

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:11.720
Stop!

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.399
God, stop it...

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.113
Stop.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:33.234
If the two of you put your hands
on these children ever again,

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.630
so help me God, I'll kill you dead.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:41.194
Open your mouth to lie, bitch,
and I'll do it now.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.639
Sonny, Little Joe,
you're coming home with me.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:50.354
If my mama had lived,
all of these bad things,

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.591
they never would've happened,
because my mama...

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.793
My mother, she would've...

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.599
She would've slapped Aunt Ethel.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.750
And she would've told Galen, "You stop it!

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.552
"You stop it. That's my daughter.
You stop it. That's my daughter!"

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.551
You just didn't stop it.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.835
Zakariyya wouldn't have had to go to jail.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.312
He wouldn't have been so mean.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.953
Everybody taking things

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.080
they ain't got no right to take.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.195
And that's why she got that look on her face.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.673
She knew.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.156
Her mama ain't never coming back.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.712
One day, she got a mother.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.279
And the next day, she don't.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.309
Ain't nobody even tell her why.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.676
It's all right. It's all right.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.595
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.880
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.830
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right...

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.796
Hey, cuz. Hey, Aunt Gladys.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.236
Hey. How you doing?

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.194
Hey, cuz, look what I got.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.158
Look what I got from Crownsville.
It's my sister.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.755
Cuz, you don't seem so good right now.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.957
I'm just having a reaction.
I'm having a reaction.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.599
I'm breaking out, and I'm swelling up

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.876
because of all this stuff
I'm learning about my mother.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.276
It hurts.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.994
- It hurts.
- Come, sit.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.950
Bet you didn't know...

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.191
Bet you didn't know
that they injected my mama

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.509
with all kinds of poisons.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.590
Dale, relax.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.115
No, only time I can relax
is when I'm driving down here.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.993
That's the only time I can relax, till I start
thinking about what they did to my mama.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.073
You know what they did?
They did whatchamacallit.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.993
They cloned her! They cloned her!

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.276
Deborah, remember we talked about this?
They didn't do that.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.272
They didn't do that.
Remember we talked about it?

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.398
No, no, you know what they did?
They mixed her with mice.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.275
And now they saying that
she's not even human no more!

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.880
She's not even human no more!

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.273
They gave my mama AIDS,
and then they injected her into a monkey.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.074
They injected her into a monkey.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.317
They injected her into a monkey...

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.598
Don't make yourself sick over something
you can't do nothing about!

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.995
You got to let God handle it!

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.670
I was just talking to God,
and He's trying to take over,

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.874
but I've been trying to keep Him out of this,
but He just won't let me keep Him out.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.516
Lord, I lift up my hand...

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.910
I lift up my hand and offer
praises to You, Lord.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.193
You are welcome in this place.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.514
You are welcome into this broken vessel.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.069
Come touch me, Lord. Come touch me tonight.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.350
- Lord...
- I thank You, Lord,

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.430
because we need Your help

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.160
lifting the burden of them cells
from this woman, Lord.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.119
Lift this burden, Lord.
Lift this burden, Lord.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.510
Take it away. We don't need it.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.638
You are welcome to this place,

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.999
welcome into this broken vessel.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.355
Show me the way, Lord.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.037
Show me which way to go.
Show me which way to go.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.794
Take this burden from me, Lord.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.997
Take this burden from me.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.151
I don't want it no more.
I don't want it no more.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.560
You are not alone!

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.912
You are not alone.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.393
Let her carry 'em!

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.960
Give her...

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.880
Let her carry it! Let her carry it!

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.032
Let her carry it!

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.990
Let it go.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.673
Let it go, let it go, let it go.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.835
Let it go. Let it go.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.555
Let it go. Let it go.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.556
It's all right. It's all right.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.880
Let it go, baby.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.834
Just let it out, there you go.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.792
Let it go, baby. Let it go.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.796
Phew.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.438
I'm gonna come back tomorrow
for some more of that.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.679
Oh, it's still coming down out there.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.119
It's still coming down out there.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.520
Still coming down out there.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.998
What does that feel like, when you're

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.557
speaking those words, and...

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.550
What does that really feel like?

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.675
Well, that's just God
telling Deborah that He cares.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.590
Read.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.276
Out loud.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.319
"Those who believe in me
will live even though they died,

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.313
"and those who live and believe in me
will never die."

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.153
Henrietta was chosen,

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.039
and when God chooses an angel to do his work,

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.759
you never know what
they're gonna come back looking like.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:40.040
So, you believe that Henrietta's spirit
lives in those cells?

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.918
No, Henrietta is those cells.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.559
Aunt Sadie, what you doing here?

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.831
Checking on my girl.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.999
The other day,

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.191
I got to remembering the last time
Hennie and me ride that wheel.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.954
Oh, that breeze.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.839
Oh, you can see clear across
to Sparrow's Point.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.877
I got something inside of me.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.796
Hennie, please don't tell me
you have another baby with that man.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.634
Oh, Gladys. What kind of thing?

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.359
Cancer.

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.559
Hennie, no.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.993
You got to promise me.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.360
Make sure nothing bad happen to my children.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.597
Especially my baby girl.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.029
I wanna braid her hair,

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.916
dress her up real pretty,

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.275
teach her how to paint her nails

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.313
and handle men.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.672
You were your mother's
first breath in the morning,

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.593
and her last prayer at night.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.510
- Should I call Christoph?
- Dale!

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.634
Don't worry, he promised to behave.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.239
I ain't got no time
for crazy today, so be good.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.039
Otherwise you won't be able to
go see them cells.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.234
- Christoph. Hi.
- Hi, Rebecca.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.552
Hello. This is Deborah, Christoph.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.036
- Hello.
- This is Henrietta's son. Christoph...

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.675
Zakariyya Bari Abdul Rahman.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.071
Zakariyya followed John the Baptist.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.313
Bari, made of clay. Abdul, service.
Rahman, most gracious.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.158
I've been working with your mother's cells
for my entire life, and this is

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.720
truly an honor.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.630
Please, follow me.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.673
Thank you so much.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.470
Thank you.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.271
Miss? Follow me.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.236
Oh, don't worry, it's not dangerous.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.795
Which... Which one is our mother's cells?

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.030
Well, they all are.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.753
Oh, my God.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.353
We can keep them here

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.997
for 100 years, even more.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.714
She's cold.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.839
You famous.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.431
Just nobody knows it.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.994
- Oh, there they are.
- Yeah.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.517
Could I look at it in the...

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.474
Oh, yes, please.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.314
It's right here.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.559
Dale, look.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.194
Would you look at here!

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.555
Excuse me.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.080
Would you hit the light, please?

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.271
Oh, my God.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.429
I can't think of anybody
who deserves it more.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.676
Hold the baby.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.274
Here you go, hold the baby. She won't...

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.999
See? She won't cry.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.831
All right, let's all take the picture
on the count of three.

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.718
One, two, three.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.269
- Jabrea!
- Jabrea!

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.834
- Thank you, son.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.836
Bye.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.312
So, when I finish it,
do you want me to send it to you

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.834
or do you want me to come down and read it?

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.118
Only certain parts.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.157
Been thinking about going back to school.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.796
Wow.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.873
- Getting certified to become a nurse's aide.
- That's fantastic.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.240
Time to get busy.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.270
<i>Deborah, hey.</i>

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.557
<i>I'm headed to</i>
<i>the Roanoke public records room,</i>

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.996
<i>so I figured I'd just swing by Clover,</i>
<i>check on Cliff.</i>

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.309
<i>You wanna tag along?</i>

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.110
<i>Deborah, I saw a mock-up</i>
<i>of the book cover today.</i>

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.157
<i>I hope you love it as much as I do.</i>

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:10.310
<i>Call me.</i>

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.153
<i>Sonny, will you please tell your sister</i>

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.755
<i>to stop messing around and return my calls?</i>

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.150
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.589
<i>When I die, I'm glad I won't
have to tell my mother's story,</i>

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.273
<i>everything that's happened,</i>

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.192
<i>'cause you've been watching it all.</i>

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.354
<i>There won't be any words,</i>

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.274
<i>just a lot of hugging and crying.</i>

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.112
<i>Heaven look just like Clover, Virginia.</i>

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.871
<i>My mother loved it down there,</i>

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.273
<i>more than anyplace else in the world.</i>

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.115
<i>I don't wanna be immortal
if it means living forever.</i>

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.589
<i>Because then everybody else just die</i>
<i>and get old in front of you</i>

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.034
<i>while you stay the same,</i>

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.672
<i>and that's just sad.</i>

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.516
Three floors up. Can you count?

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.357
Say "hey" to Mommy.

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.114
Mommy.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.638
<i>I don't know how I'm gonna go.</i>

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.239
<i>I just hope it's nice and calm.</i>

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:13.034
<i>Maybe I'll come back as some HeLa cells,</i>
<i>like my mother.</i>

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:16.792
<i>That way, we can do good out there</i>
<i>in the world together.</i>

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.592
<i>I think I'd like that.</i>

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.396
<i>My baby Deborah</i>

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.592
<i>Your mommy loves you</i>

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.917
<i>Your mommy loves you</i>

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.877
<i>Baby Deborah</i>

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:37.711
<i>Baby Deborah...</i>

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.470
That's right.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.630
<i>Baby Deborah...</i>

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.356
See?
