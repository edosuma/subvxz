20:05.336 --> 20:07.803
<i>I mean, Dr. Labcoat.</i>

20:07.838 --> 20:09.071
You're welcome.

20:09.106 --> 20:13.142
<i>Anyhoo, is it true you
have the cure to Virus X?</i>

20:13.178 --> 20:15.496
- Yes.
- <i>Whoa, wow, wee,</i>

20:15.497 --> 20:16.797
<i>pee-pee, poo-poo!</i>

20:16.847 --> 20:19.382
<i>That's good news! We
here in the government</i>

20:19.417 --> 20:22.150
<i>was gonna blowed up New York
'cause of all of the sick people.</i>

20:22.186 --> 20:23.785
<i>That's why we quarantined it!</i>

20:23.820 --> 20:26.154
<i>- Phew!</i>
- Yeah, I understand.

20:26.190 --> 20:28.790
<i>The Green Pill, huh? I like that name.</i>

20:28.825 --> 20:30.425
<i>It's easy to say and remember.</i>

20:30.460 --> 20:32.860
<i>I'll go to the TV and say
everybody should buy it.</i>

20:32.896 --> 20:35.763
<i>You have my full backing.
Spit in my mouth hole.</i>

20:35.799 --> 20:39.166
- Thank you, The President.
- <i>Did you know that I'm a big boy?</i>

20:39.202 --> 20:42.169
<i>I'm all growed up, and they painted
my picture in the Oval Office!</i>

20:42.205 --> 20:43.837
<i>And now it's in all
the textbooks forever!</i>

20:43.872 --> 20:45.539
<i>I'm a real thing that's happening!</i>

20:45.575 --> 20:48.609
- (laughing)
- (hesitantly) Yes, I heard.

20:48.644 --> 20:51.745
<i>I... I... I actually
can't believe it myself.</i>

20:51.780 --> 20:54.347
<i>I'm bad. I'm... I'm a bad man</i>

20:54.382 --> 20:56.216
<i>with bad values and morals.</i>

20:56.251 --> 20:58.751
<i>I propagate hate and award selfishness.</i>

20:58.786 --> 21:00.152
<i>I'm a deeply stunted man,</i>

21:00.188 --> 21:02.888
<i>and it all stems from
my weird face and body.</i>

21:02.924 --> 21:04.957
(clearing throat)

21:04.992 --> 21:08.728
I'm afraid this is all the
time I have, The President.

21:08.763 --> 21:12.331
- Have a good night.
- (singsongy) <i>Piss!</i>

21:12.366 --> 21:15.234
- (hums)
- (knocking on door)

21:18.739 --> 21:20.305
- (chimes)
- Woman's voice: <i>Enter.</i>

21:20.341 --> 21:22.641
<i>Enter. Enter. Enter.</i>

21:22.676 --> 21:25.577
Hey. The outside doorbell. You did it.

21:25.613 --> 21:28.412
It seemed like a
reasonable enough idea...

21:28.448 --> 21:30.581
plus it wasn't that
hard to put in place.

21:30.617 --> 21:32.916
(chuckles) Thanks.

21:39.525 --> 21:40.791
Dr. Labcoat.

21:41.761 --> 21:42.627
- You're evil.
- ♪
♪

21:42.662 --> 21:44.928
What you're doing here at Pesci Co...

21:44.964 --> 21:47.631
making children sick,
making people sick...

21:47.666 --> 21:51.368
all so they'll buy your pill
the day it's released? It's...

21:52.337 --> 21:53.270
evil.

21:53.305 --> 21:54.537
You want to control the world.

21:54.573 --> 21:56.239
You want to control the population.

21:57.743 --> 21:59.208
But I'm evil too.

22:00.245 --> 22:01.678
I want control, too.

22:01.713 --> 22:04.079
I remember when I was
in the third grade,

22:04.114 --> 22:06.482
it was my job to turn off the lights

22:06.517 --> 22:09.017
when we left the classroom.

22:09.052 --> 22:12.821
But then, one day, my teacher
gave the job to Kraig Mullen.

22:12.856 --> 22:14.690
(squeaks)

22:14.725 --> 22:16.659
I protested, but she didn't budge.

22:18.763 --> 22:21.796
So, I burned the school
down. I was never caught.

22:21.831 --> 22:24.064
I wasn't sloppy.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.033
And then, when I was
in high school, I...

22:26.068 --> 22:29.304
You were bullied by a
boy named Scott Trevors.

22:30.540 --> 22:33.441
You injected a hydrochloric compound

22:33.476 --> 22:36.010
into his deodorant while
you were in gym class,

22:36.045 --> 22:39.112
and it affected his lymph
nodes, which eventually led...

22:40.048 --> 22:41.281
to his death.

22:42.685 --> 22:46.052
Your birth name is Alexander Regelman,

22:46.087 --> 22:47.654
your blood type is "O,"

22:47.690 --> 22:50.824
and your favorite animal is the turtle.

22:50.859 --> 22:54.327
- (chuckles)
- I know who you are, The Assistant.

22:55.196 --> 22:57.463
We're very much alike.

22:57.498 --> 22:59.799
That's why I invited
you to the board meeting.

23:00.835 --> 23:02.468
I see you...

23:02.503 --> 23:06.372
as my eventual successor.

23:08.409 --> 23:09.842
- Ah!
- Don't speak.

23:15.382 --> 23:16.948
(smacks lips) By the way...

23:18.318 --> 23:19.317
this came for you today.

23:19.353 --> 23:22.954
(ominous music playing)

23:24.123 --> 23:26.290
(chuckles)

23:28.227 --> 23:29.393
Wait.

23:32.598 --> 23:33.364
Do you wanna, like,

23:33.399 --> 23:35.932
- order pizza or something?
- Oh!

23:35.968 --> 23:38.301
- (feel-good music playing)
- Dr. Labcoat: I killed my mother.

23:38.337 --> 23:39.470
- What?
- Yeah.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.805
- Hated her.
- Oh, my God.

23:41.841 --> 23:44.140
(emphatically) Hated her. Awful.

23:44.176 --> 23:47.243
I used bicarbonate
and dishwashing liquid.

23:47.278 --> 23:49.512
- No.
- It was amazing.

23:49.547 --> 23:52.548
(pounding) <i>Dr. Labcoat!
It's Executive 3!</i>

23:52.584 --> 23:55.852
<i>Dr. Labcoat! Dr. Labcoat!</i>

23:55.887 --> 23:56.886
<i>This really sucks!</i>

23:56.921 --> 23:59.922
- (both laughing)
- Poisoned Executive Number 3!

23:59.957 --> 24:02.023
- <i>Dr. Labcoat!</i>
- (grunting) How did you do it?

24:02.058 --> 24:05.093
- <i>Help me!</i>
- (laughing) Oh, I... I did it...

24:05.128 --> 24:08.096
- at the...
- When we were... (laughing)

24:15.038 --> 24:17.572
- Yeah. What a sucker.
- (coughing)

24:17.608 --> 24:21.074
- (laughter continues)
- The Assistant: Oh, my God. I hated that guy.

24:21.110 --> 24:23.977
- I hated him. I hated him.
- Dr. Labcoat: I hated that guy.
