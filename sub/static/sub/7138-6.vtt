01:45.233 --> 01:46.734
- Fact:

01:46.734 --> 01:50.333
2.5 million people die in
the United States each year.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.734
This, of course,

01:51.734 --> 01:53.734
is using the dictionary
definition of "dead,"

01:53.734 --> 01:55.200
toe-tagged
and body-bagged.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.967
The number one cause
of death in America:

01:57.967 --> 01:59.600
heart disease.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.967
- But not all heart disease'll
leave you dictionary "dead."

02:01.967 --> 02:05.567
Some will kill you
and still leave you living.

02:05.567 --> 02:07.166
Yeah.

02:07.166 --> 02:10.200
We got a whole lot
of walking dead in Oz.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.333
- Toby, there you are.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.834
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.100
- Get the fuck
away from me.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.734
- I heard what you've
been telling people.

02:26.734 --> 02:28.433
Do you honestly believe
I would fuck you over

02:28.433 --> 02:29.667
just to
get you back?

02:29.667 --> 02:31.066
- Don't play
the wounded puppy.

02:31.066 --> 02:32.500
I know who you are.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.700
- Toby, I love you.
I need you.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.467
- Oh, you're only
making it worse.

02:39.467 --> 02:43.066
- You've gotta believe me,
I'm innocent.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.367
- Okay.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.133
Let's say I give you
the benefit of the doubt.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.900
Let's say you didn't
do it on purpose.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.333
The bottom line is,
I believe you would,

02:53.333 --> 02:55.133
that you're capable of it.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.066
That's the kind of man
I think you are,

02:57.066 --> 03:00.533
and I wish to God
I'd left you on death row.

03:14.266 --> 03:15.767
- How's it goin'
there, Chris?

03:15.767 --> 03:17.433
- Go away.

03:17.433 --> 03:20.834
- Ah, I can understand you
being a little testy.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.700
I heard about what
went on in the gym.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.133
It's a heartbreaker.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.734
- I'll survive.

03:28.734 --> 03:30.467
- I know you will.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.967
You always do.

03:32.967 --> 03:36.800
I remember when we first served
time together back in Lardner.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.800
Christ, you were--

03:39.800 --> 03:41.600
what, 17?

03:41.600 --> 03:45.834
You came walkin' into that
cell block, strutting, really.

03:45.834 --> 03:49.467
I said, "There is one
tough little motherfucker."

03:49.467 --> 03:51.300
- Oh, what is
this, Vern?

03:51.300 --> 03:53.133
Why the sprint down
memory lane?

03:53.133 --> 03:55.834
- Been thinkin' about
how close we were.

03:55.834 --> 03:58.133
- You protected me,
I sucked your cock.

03:58.133 --> 03:59.233
That was it.

03:59.233 --> 04:00.433
I didn't love you.

04:00.433 --> 04:02.667
- I didn't love you,
either.

04:02.667 --> 04:05.633
But you gotta admit,

04:05.633 --> 04:10.200
what we had was
more than nothin'.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.934
- So what?

04:11.934 --> 04:14.066
Too much shit's happened
between us since Lardner.

04:14.066 --> 04:15.734
Yeah, because
of Beecher.

04:15.734 --> 04:18.133
Now that he's done,

04:18.133 --> 04:21.667
I'm saying
let's be friends again.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.133
No cock sucking,

04:24.133 --> 04:26.233
just two guys lookin' out
for each other.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.433
What do you say?

04:30.767 --> 04:32.066
- Okay.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.567
- Cancer,

04:46.567 --> 04:49.200
the scariest fuckin' word
in the English language,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.700
and the second-leading
cause of death.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.133
It might be your Zodiac sign,
but more likely,

04:55.133 --> 04:58.000
cancer will eat
your insides up.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.266
Do you know why
it's so fuckin' scary?

05:00.266 --> 05:04.467
'Cause the word itself
is a cancer.

05:04.467 --> 05:07.033
Just the idea of it
can infect you.

05:07.033 --> 05:09.834
The stress of it can spread
through your spirit.

05:09.834 --> 05:12.900
The fear can turn
into the disease.

05:14.533 --> 05:17.633
- Yo, Rebadow,
over here.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.500
- What do you want
today, Pablo?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.633
- I want to know what the fuck
your problem is, man.

05:21.633 --> 05:24.100
I mean, why are you treating
Miss C. like a bitch?

05:24.100 --> 05:25.433
- She's not a bitch.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.066
- That's right,
she's a nice lady.

05:27.066 --> 05:28.667
She's helping me
ride out my time,

05:28.667 --> 05:30.133
and yet you're bringing her
the fuck down.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.200
And the cancer?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.033
It ain't that
big a deal.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.500
That's right,
she told me yesterday.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.533
I guess she needed
someone to talk to

05:37.533 --> 05:39.400
since you're acting
my younger fuckin' sister.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.667
Maria freaked when
my ma got breast cancer.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.266
Of course,
she was eight.

05:44.266 --> 05:46.000
And mi madre?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.967
She squashed that disease
like it was a cockroach.

05:48.967 --> 05:52.633
I bet that's somethin'
you can identify with.

06:08.967 --> 06:11.200
- Stella...

06:11.200 --> 06:13.734
Could you sit a minute?

06:27.166 --> 06:29.867
I've dealt with a lot
of death in my life.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.633
- We all have.

06:32.867 --> 06:37.166
- But for me, this place
was never more a prison

06:37.166 --> 06:38.967
than when Alex Jr.
Was dying.

06:38.967 --> 06:42.033
- I'm not dying,
Robert.

06:48.233 --> 06:51.533
- You don't know that
for certain.

06:51.533 --> 06:56.066
- I'm sure as hell
more certain than you are.

06:56.066 --> 06:58.100
And you may want to bone up
on your apologies,

06:58.100 --> 07:00.367
'cause this one sucks.

07:00.367 --> 07:03.600
- I've been insensitive
and self-absorbed, I'm sorry.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.333
I just couldn't deal
with the prospect

07:05.333 --> 07:09.834
of losing someone else,
someone I love.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.667
- You don't love me,
Robert.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.834
- Yes, I do.

07:17.834 --> 07:21.800
And I promise
to be here for you.

07:25.133 --> 07:28.800
- I don't want you here.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.133
Listen, I'm glad you understand
what I'm going through,

07:33.133 --> 07:36.800
but your worries,
your concerns,

07:36.800 --> 07:41.200
don't dissipate simply
because you 'fess up to them.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.967
My lumpectomy is in
a couple of days.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.934
As much as I appreciate
your feelings for me,

07:47.934 --> 07:52.066
right now, you are just
not good to have around.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.000
- Yes.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.667
You're right, of course.

07:58.667 --> 08:03.000
But let me say
one thing before I go.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.166
- What, are you nuts?

08:23.166 --> 08:25.600
Requesting a transfer
into Gen Pop,

08:25.600 --> 08:28.433
Emerald City,
especially?

08:28.433 --> 08:31.600
That's where
Said lived.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.834
People there
loved him.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.066
- Not everybody.

08:36.066 --> 08:39.467
- I'm tellin' you, Idzik,
this is suicide.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.233
- The worst thing
about being in prison,

08:47.233 --> 08:50.600
the thing I didn't
factor into my equation,

08:50.600 --> 08:53.333
we're in lockdown
so early,

08:53.333 --> 08:56.834
I never get to see
the night sky.

08:56.834 --> 09:01.266
I used to go to the planetarium
every single evening.

09:01.266 --> 09:03.967
Yeah, I'd peer through
the telescope

09:03.967 --> 09:08.367
and search the universe...

09:11.333 --> 09:14.834
Looking for a sign.

09:14.834 --> 09:18.066
But there never was one.

09:19.667 --> 09:22.767
Everything out there
is so still.

09:22.767 --> 09:25.867
I didn't even see
a shooting star.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.033
- You have got
a lot of nerve

09:36.033 --> 09:39.967
I mean, bringing that
scumbag to Em City.

09:39.967 --> 09:43.433
- Omar, all we've got
in Em City are scumbags,

09:43.433 --> 09:45.333
including you!

09:45.333 --> 09:47.633
I mean, given
everything you've done,

09:47.633 --> 09:50.200
starting with the cold-blooded
murder of Felicia Brown,

09:50.200 --> 09:53.200
I don't exactly see why
you are so self-righteous.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.333
McManus,
the man killed Said.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.033
Oh, oh, I grant,
all right, right,

09:59.033 --> 10:00.533
you and the minister
didn't always get along.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.100
- That's true,
but we respected each other,

10:03.100 --> 10:04.333
most of the time.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.400
- It's an insult
to Kareem's memory,

10:06.400 --> 10:08.066
you bringing him here.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.467
- Just a few days ago you were
beggin' me to let you see him.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.166
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
see him, see him,

10:12.166 --> 10:13.900
yeah, but not to have
to breathe the same foul air

10:13.900 --> 10:15.734
with him on a continuous basis,
and shit, damn!

10:15.734 --> 10:17.200
- Omar, Omar!

10:17.200 --> 10:21.600
I want your promise
no harm will come to Idzik.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.133
Now swear to me.

10:23.133 --> 10:24.533
- No!

10:24.533 --> 10:26.667
- Don't give me a reason
to stick your ass

10:26.667 --> 10:29.166
back in solitary permanently!

10:30.333 --> 10:32.433
- Yeah, okay.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.033
Okay, okay, okay!

10:34.033 --> 10:37.767
I won't hurt Idzik.

10:37.767 --> 10:38.900
- Good.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.667
Now, I want you
to meet him.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.100
- Huh?

10:44.333 --> 10:46.800
- Lemuel Idzik,
Omar White.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.000
Omar's gonna
be your sponsor.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.700
- McManus only put us together
to fuck with my head,

10:53.700 --> 10:55.533
and maybe yours, too.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.433
- Why would he do that?

10:57.433 --> 10:59.667
- He's looking to kick my ass
back to solitary, right?

10:59.667 --> 11:02.000
So, he buddies us up and shit,
man, you know,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.233
knowing there's gonna be
motherfuckin' trouble.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.767
- Between us, why?

11:06.767 --> 11:10.266
- Because I'm lookin'
to whack you, man,

11:10.266 --> 11:12.300
for whacking Said.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.567
- Ah, I see.

11:16.567 --> 11:19.266
Perfect.

11:19.266 --> 11:22.133
As the clock runs out,

11:22.133 --> 11:24.333
the hands of fate
are applauding.

11:24.333 --> 11:27.500
- What--what the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

11:27.500 --> 11:31.100
- I asked to be placed
in Em City for one purpose

11:31.100 --> 11:35.000
and one purpose only.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.834
- Yeah, what's that?

11:36.834 --> 11:38.967
- To find someone
to kill me.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.734
- Detective Tarnowski.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.467
- Hello, Warden,
it's a pleasure.

11:59.467 --> 12:00.867
- What can I do
for you?

12:00.867 --> 12:02.367
- I'm from homicide here,

12:02.367 --> 12:04.900
replacing Detective McGorry
on the Wilson Loewen case.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.600
- Replacing McGorry, why?

12:07.600 --> 12:08.900
- She was rotated
out of the unit.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.133
Happens all the time.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.734
- Not in the middle
of a major case.

12:11.734 --> 12:15.166
- A major case that, for all
intents and purposes, is over.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.300
- Let's go
to my office.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.166
- Willy Brandt confessed
to the murder.

12:22.166 --> 12:23.667
What more
do you need?

12:23.667 --> 12:24.667
- Brandt had no motive to
assassinate Loewen,

12:24.667 --> 12:26.233
except money.

12:26.233 --> 12:28.700
Now, he admitted he was paid
to do the crime by a C.O.,

12:28.700 --> 12:30.266
Adrian Johnson.

12:30.266 --> 12:31.533
- Did you
interrogate him yet?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.867
- Not formally,
but I talked to him,

12:33.867 --> 12:35.367
and he's guilty.

12:35.367 --> 12:38.066
I want to find out why
Johnson ordered the hit.

12:38.066 --> 12:39.700
- Come on, warden,
the reasons are racial.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.233
Loewen conspired to kill
two little black girls

12:42.233 --> 12:43.800
back in the '60s.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.233
That would make
any man angry.

12:45.233 --> 12:49.266
- McGorry thought
something else was going on.

12:49.266 --> 12:50.900
Didn't you read
her report?

12:50.900 --> 12:51.967
- Sure, sure.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.500
Between you
and the doorpost,

12:53.500 --> 12:55.000
my lieutenant wants me
to wrap this stinker up fast,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.467
and that's what
I intend to do.

12:56.467 --> 12:57.934
So, let's
find this C.O.--

12:57.934 --> 12:59.734
- Johnson.

12:59.734 --> 13:01.033
- Yeah, and put
this baby to bed.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.700
Now, which way?

13:05.367 --> 13:07.800
Do you know a prisoner
named William Brandt?

13:07.800 --> 13:09.133
- I know who he is.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.166
I don't know him
personally.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.767
- You never had
any contact with him?

13:12.767 --> 13:14.333
- Maybe once or twice.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.934
You know the way shit flies
around here, warden.

13:15.934 --> 13:17.433
- How about
Lionel Kelsch?

13:17.433 --> 13:18.767
- Same thing.

13:18.767 --> 13:20.467
- Did you ever meet
Mayor Wilson Loewen,

13:20.467 --> 13:22.967
either before or after
he was incarcerated in Oswald?

13:22.967 --> 13:24.867
- Nope.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.433
- Where were you
the night he was killed?

13:26.433 --> 13:28.934
- Home in bed
with my wife.

13:28.934 --> 13:32.100
- All right, officer,
thank you very much.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.200
- I'll get back
to work.

13:37.467 --> 13:40.233
- I'd hardly call that
a comprehensive interview.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.800
- You got a problem
with this guy, warden?

13:41.800 --> 13:43.233
- No.

13:43.233 --> 13:45.133
Until now I considered him
one of my top C.O.s.

13:45.133 --> 13:47.266
- Then why would you be
willing to take the word

13:47.266 --> 13:48.967
of a convicted felon
over his?

13:48.967 --> 13:51.667
I'd say Johnson
is innocent.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.500
- Hello, Leo.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.500
- Oh, Perry,
thanks for coming by.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.967
Sit.

14:00.967 --> 14:03.934
You know, I'm just starting
to use the Internet,

14:03.934 --> 14:06.967
starting to really
see its potential.

14:06.967 --> 14:09.200
- Leo, you said
this was urgent.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.934
I'm a busy fellow.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.433
- I know you are.

14:12.433 --> 14:15.233
Taking care of the governor,
that's a big job.

14:15.233 --> 14:18.233
And let's face it,
Devlin is a needy man.

14:18.233 --> 14:21.367
But you have
been amazing,

14:21.367 --> 14:24.400
cleaning up all of his messes,
his indiscretions.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.000
- What's this about?

14:26.000 --> 14:31.834
- Well, I was just reviewing
officer Adrian Johnson's file.

14:31.834 --> 14:36.133
I noticed he attended
the Middlesex Academy for Boys.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.033
Out of curiosity,

14:38.033 --> 14:41.300
I went to their website
where they list the alumni.

14:41.300 --> 14:45.800
You and he graduated
the same year?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.967
- Actually, he was a senior
when I was a freshman.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.467
- Ah...

14:49.467 --> 14:55.533
We suspect Johnson paid Brandt
to whack the mayor.

14:55.533 --> 14:56.734
- What?

14:56.734 --> 14:58.467
- When the truth
comes out,

14:58.467 --> 15:00.467
it could do real damage
to you, to your career.

15:00.467 --> 15:04.133
Guilt by association.

15:04.133 --> 15:07.300
- I don't believe that Adrian's
connected to Loewen's murder,

15:07.300 --> 15:11.100
but I appreciate
your concern.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.600
- Mmm.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.667
Well, I'd just hate
to see a fine man like you

15:14.667 --> 15:17.967
take an unnecessary fall.

15:35.066 --> 15:36.266
- What's up, Perry?

15:36.266 --> 15:37.767
- There's something
I need you to do.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.166
- Kill Willie Brandt?

15:39.166 --> 15:40.467
- Yes.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.233
And Leo Glynn.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.900
- The third leading cause
of death in America is stroke,

16:00.900 --> 16:03.834
or as they like
to call it these days,

16:03.834 --> 16:05.300
brain attack.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.633
Serious.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.200
That's a real
medical term.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.900
But who the fuck among us
ain't had their brain attacked

16:10.900 --> 16:14.133
and had some part of themselves
shut down, paralyzed,

16:14.133 --> 16:17.533
which forces us to
keep on attacking back?

16:19.066 --> 16:20.734
- After Cutler died,

16:20.734 --> 16:22.367
I started...

16:22.367 --> 16:26.333
From my old ways,
you know,

16:26.333 --> 16:29.367
bullying people
and waving my dick around.

16:29.367 --> 16:33.500
I've crossed a lot of lines
in my life, Sister.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.800
But hurtin' my wife,

16:35.800 --> 16:39.233
that was one line
I never thought I'd cross.

16:39.233 --> 16:42.734
I always said I would
never lay a hand on Liesel.

16:42.734 --> 16:46.266
You know,
being in the hole

16:46.266 --> 16:49.567
gave me time to really
think about who I am

16:49.567 --> 16:51.900
and who I want to be.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.533
- All right.

16:54.533 --> 16:57.367
Let's imagine that
you could do it over,

16:57.367 --> 16:58.767
the visit with Liesel.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.834
What would you
do differently?

17:00.834 --> 17:03.333
- I'd talk.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.834
Hug her.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.467
Yeah.

17:08.467 --> 17:12.900
Stroke her hair,

17:12.900 --> 17:15.567
but not put her hand
inside my pants.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.500
What the fuck
was I thinking?

17:17.500 --> 17:20.133
- And you would
talk about, what?

17:20.133 --> 17:22.867
- I don't know.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.900
Life.

17:25.900 --> 17:30.567
Life without her,
how much it sucks.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.066
- And?

17:37.600 --> 17:42.567
- And that stuff
with Cutler, I guess.

17:42.567 --> 17:45.133
- What stuff?

17:45.133 --> 17:48.500
- You know what stuff.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.500
- Yes, James, but by
articulating what happened,

17:51.500 --> 17:53.734
you accept it.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.500
- It's the first step
in healing.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.967
- I would tell my wife
that I was raped,

18:11.967 --> 18:15.967
and that's why I didn't
call her for so long.

18:19.033 --> 18:22.667
And I would tell her
that I'm sorry

18:22.667 --> 18:25.934
that I turned into
such a fucking fuck-up.

18:34.867 --> 18:37.700
- I, um, I came to Oz
nine months ago.

18:37.700 --> 18:44.600
I--I was a virgin,
so, right away I was targeted.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.600
So, I kept
breaking the rules,

18:48.600 --> 18:53.166
refusing to go to work
or take a shower,

18:53.166 --> 18:54.533
shit like that.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.600
They put me on
special restrictions.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.867
I figured I'd be safe,
locked in my cell all day.

19:01.867 --> 19:04.633
But then...

19:04.633 --> 19:09.667
They put this lowlife
in my cell, and he...

19:09.667 --> 19:14.467
He beat me
till I said yes.

19:14.467 --> 19:17.700
As he was doing it,

19:17.700 --> 19:19.834
I could hear the TV
in the C.O.'s office.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.433
They were watching
"I Love Lucy."

19:22.433 --> 19:24.066
- Thanksgiving Day,

19:24.066 --> 19:28.800
six guys come into my cell
while I'm asleep.

19:28.800 --> 19:34.667
They held me down and they put
a razor to my throat.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.300
- I asked for a kit
to collect evidence

19:37.300 --> 19:38.800
to prove what happened.

19:38.800 --> 19:43.266
The C.O. waited two days
to take me to the infirmary.

19:43.266 --> 19:48.233
- He said, he bought me
for two cartons of Kools.

19:48.233 --> 19:50.066
- By the time
the nurse examined me,

19:50.066 --> 19:51.500
there was nothing
left to find.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.033
- I--I tried to ride,
but I ran out of money.

19:55.033 --> 19:58.000
- They took turns orally
and anally penetrating.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.767
- Someone wrote my mother.

19:59.767 --> 20:02.533
She wrote the warden.

20:02.533 --> 20:03.834
- I was rented out.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.033
- Please help my son.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.533
- $3 for a blow job,.

20:06.533 --> 20:07.700
- The hack told me...

20:07.700 --> 20:09.033
- $5 for anal sex.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.300
- Quit whining,
to stand up and fight.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.967
- I saved the sleeping
medication Sister was giving me,

20:14.967 --> 20:18.400
10 days' worth,
1,000 milligrams.

20:18.400 --> 20:24.967
One night, after,
I took 'em all.

20:24.967 --> 20:27.600
I had no choice.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.567
- I had no choice.
- I had no choice.

20:29.567 --> 20:32.033
- I had no choice.
- I had no choice.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.734
- I had no choice.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.667
- you want any of
Morales' stuff?

20:46.667 --> 20:49.533
- No.
- I feel bad.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.967
Enrique was really angry
at me when he died.

20:52.967 --> 20:55.233
- Well, it's probably
best he's dead.

20:55.233 --> 20:57.467
He would've made
your life miserable.

20:57.467 --> 20:59.000
- True.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.500
But he's got
no family left.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.266
They're gonna stick his body
in Potter's Field.

21:04.266 --> 21:06.567
- He ain't gonna know
the difference.

21:06.567 --> 21:10.600
- More and more, compadre,
I'm tired of all this shit.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.600
- I hear you, man.

21:13.600 --> 21:17.667
- Pancamo asked me
who was gonna lead El Norte.

21:17.667 --> 21:21.700
- What'd you say?

21:21.700 --> 21:22.767
- You.

21:22.767 --> 21:24.433
- Fuck that.

21:24.433 --> 21:25.900
I told you, man,

21:25.900 --> 21:27.133
I'm keeping my head down
till my next parole hearing.

21:27.133 --> 21:29.600
- Miguel.
- No.

21:33.633 --> 21:36.133
- Alvarez, you got
a surprise visitor.

21:36.133 --> 21:37.834
- My girlfriend Maritza?

21:37.834 --> 21:39.633
- No, one,
Cathy Jo Cutler.

21:39.633 --> 21:40.867
- She's the...

21:40.867 --> 21:42.700
- Wolfgang Cutler's
grieving widow.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.166
- Right.
Well, that's good.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.266
Now, I can figure out why
he left me all his shit.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.967
- Yeah, good luck.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.600
- Hey.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.133
Hi.
Cathy Jo, right?

22:15.133 --> 22:16.767
- Yes.

22:16.767 --> 22:18.433
Thank you
for seeing me.

22:18.433 --> 22:20.367
- Sure, of course.

22:20.367 --> 22:25.233
- Mr. Alvarez, I'm here
to ask you, beg you.

22:25.233 --> 22:27.400
Wait, wait, wait.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.867
- Okay, first of all,
Miguel, all right?

22:30.867 --> 22:33.500
Let me just save you
a little speech or whatever.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.500
I don't want
your husband's crap.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.233
- Oh.

22:38.233 --> 22:41.033
I didn't know
you decided that.

22:41.033 --> 22:42.900
- Yeah, no, I just did.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.900
- I didn't sleep
a wink last night,

22:45.900 --> 22:47.734
thinkin' what
to say to you,

22:47.734 --> 22:50.900
the new owner of the bed
I was lyin' in.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.133
- You gotta do somethin'
for me first, okay?

22:54.133 --> 22:56.533
You gotta tell me
why he did this.

22:56.533 --> 22:59.800
- Believe me, I've been
wrackin' my brains.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.000
He did like
to fuck with me

23:03.000 --> 23:04.900
when it came
to the purse strings.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.533
Serves me right,
maybe, you know?

23:07.533 --> 23:10.166
Why did I marry him
if I never loved him?

23:13.734 --> 23:15.767
You're not married?

23:15.767 --> 23:17.233
- No, no.

23:17.233 --> 23:20.066
Girlfriend...

23:20.066 --> 23:23.367
She don't
come around now.

23:26.934 --> 23:29.166
Ah.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.934
- Well, um, I guess
that's all, then.

23:40.500 --> 23:45.500
Thank you for being a better
husband than my husband.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.033
If that makes sense.

23:47.033 --> 23:49.033
- Anytime.

23:49.033 --> 23:51.066
Maybe I'll
see you again?

23:51.066 --> 23:55.233
You know, if I gotta
sign papers, whatever?

23:55.233 --> 23:57.867
- Okay, Miguel.

23:57.867 --> 24:00.934
- Cathy, all right.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.200
- Say your prayers,
Enrique.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.467
- No, don't.

24:14.467 --> 24:15.734
- You're just
like Martinez,

24:15.734 --> 24:18.633
a nasty man
who deserves to die.

24:20.033 --> 24:22.133
- Thy kingdom come,

24:22.133 --> 24:24.500
thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.100
Give us this day
our daily bread,

24:27.100 --> 24:29.266
and forgive us
our trespasses

24:29.266 --> 24:31.533
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

24:31.533 --> 24:36.300
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.333
Amen.

24:41.767 --> 24:45.400
You know, someday,
maybe soon,

24:45.400 --> 24:48.367
these guys are gonna be
carrying my body out.

24:48.367 --> 24:51.433
- Nah, you're gonna
get paroled.

24:51.433 --> 24:53.066
I've been thinkin'...

24:53.066 --> 24:55.533
We should
set up a meeting

24:55.533 --> 24:56.700
between you
and Luis Ruiz.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.834
- I hit the motherfucker
in the face.

24:58.834 --> 25:01.266
He's not gonna come by
for afternoon tea.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.100
- Steve Dawkins is retiring
from the parole board,

25:04.100 --> 25:06.467
and the rumor is that Ruiz
is gonna get the job.

25:06.467 --> 25:07.834
You're gonna need him
to be on your side.

25:07.834 --> 25:09.600
- Fine.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.233
I'll do whatever
you two guys say.

25:11.233 --> 25:14.166
I just don't want to end up
like Enrique Morales.

25:14.166 --> 25:17.133
You know, I don't want
to end up as the landfill.

25:29.233 --> 25:32.567
- The autopsy report shows that
Enrique Morales was suffocated,

25:32.567 --> 25:34.266
same as Martinez.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.767
- What, do you think
Dave Brass did the job?

25:36.767 --> 25:39.834
- I'm betting both murders
were done by the same man.

25:39.834 --> 25:41.734
I need a list of
all the patients

25:41.734 --> 25:43.333
who were in
the ward both nights.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.700
- I already checked,
there wasn't one.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.533
- Well, Morales had
a lot of enemies,

25:46.533 --> 25:47.700
could be two killers.

25:47.700 --> 25:48.900
- What about your staff?

25:48.900 --> 25:50.367
Didn't they see anything?

25:50.367 --> 25:52.333
- Oh, you know the night shift
is skeletal at best.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.533
- Who was on duty?

25:53.533 --> 25:56.200
- Carol Grace,
Gerald Lesowski.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.967
- Carol Grace.

25:57.967 --> 25:59.900
You know, Morales said
something to me about her,

25:59.900 --> 26:02.500
that I should
check her background.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.834
Where's she from?

26:03.834 --> 26:05.033
- Well, I don't know.

26:05.033 --> 26:07.266
She was hired
before I got here.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.667
- Pull her file.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.967
- Breathtaking.

26:14.967 --> 26:18.333
That's a nice way to describe
someone or something, right?

26:18.333 --> 26:21.100
What the fuck's so good about
having your breath taken?

26:21.100 --> 26:24.333
Respiratory disease
clocks in at number four

26:24.333 --> 26:27.166
on our little hit parade
and for good reason,

26:27.166 --> 26:29.467
'cause regardless of who
takes your breath away,

26:29.467 --> 26:31.934
be it four packs a day
or just one chick,

26:31.934 --> 26:33.800
you're dead
just the same.

26:35.266 --> 26:37.100
- Carol.

26:37.100 --> 26:40.400
Would you step into my office
for a minute, please?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.400
- All right, doctor.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.900
Oh, hello, warden.

26:47.900 --> 26:50.033
- We looked at your
employment record, Carol.

26:50.033 --> 26:51.900
Before coming
to Oswald,

26:51.900 --> 26:54.400
you worked at Millard Fillmore
Hospital in Buffalo

26:54.400 --> 26:56.533
and St. Eligius
in Boston.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.033
- What is this about?

26:58.033 --> 27:00.133
- You were fired
from both institutions.

27:00.133 --> 27:02.100
Why?

27:02.100 --> 27:04.100
- Jealousy.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.400
The patients always
liked me the best.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.800
- We checked with the head
of nursing at both places.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.934
A combined total of eight men
died on your watch.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.867
- And I checked our own
death certificates.

27:13.867 --> 27:16.834
Three prisoners coded
while you were on duty.

27:16.834 --> 27:19.300
- What are you implying?

27:19.300 --> 27:21.100
- The police will
take you downtown,

27:21.100 --> 27:22.433
to the homicide unit.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.233
- All right, just let me
get my things.

27:24.233 --> 27:26.400
Get out of
my way, you!

27:26.400 --> 27:27.967
Ahh!

27:27.967 --> 27:29.200
God, help me!

27:29.200 --> 27:30.400
Leave me alone
you fuckin' bastard!

27:30.400 --> 27:33.367
Leave me alone,
you Spanish cunt!

27:33.367 --> 27:35.033
You fuckin' bitch!

27:35.033 --> 27:36.967
Spanish cunt!

27:36.967 --> 27:38.767
Let me go!

27:38.767 --> 27:41.033
- Accidents are the fifth
leading cause of death.

27:41.033 --> 27:43.500
But you know
as well as me,

27:43.500 --> 27:46.100
there's no such thing
as an accident.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.266
That's just
some bullshit word

27:48.266 --> 27:50.000
we used instead
of blaming ourselves,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.066
because no matter what
damn lie you've been told,

27:53.066 --> 27:57.533
we're the leading
cause of death, mankind,

27:57.533 --> 27:59.934
and there's no cure for us.

28:03.834 --> 28:06.033
- It's the wages.

28:06.033 --> 28:08.867
We cannot compete
with Arif.

28:08.867 --> 28:10.567
- I'm not worried, Burr.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.633
- Yeah, well,
I can see that.

28:12.633 --> 28:14.100
Explain why.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.834
- This is a prison.

28:15.834 --> 28:18.300
There are 28,000 men
sitting around

28:18.300 --> 28:19.734
with nothing to do.

28:19.734 --> 28:22.800
In economic terms, the labor
supply dwarfs its demand.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.200
- Yeah, but what makes a prison
is the pride inside,

28:26.200 --> 28:29.233
knowing that
the other inmates

28:29.233 --> 28:31.567
are making 20 times
as much as you are?

28:31.567 --> 28:34.233
- I'll say it again,
supply and demand.

28:34.233 --> 28:37.667
You, my good friend, are going
to do some more recruiting.

28:37.667 --> 28:40.100
- I already tapped
all of my soldiers.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.800
They've gone
AWOL on me.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.633
- Then you're gonna
have to branch out.

28:44.633 --> 28:48.033
We can manage half-staffed
a couple of days, but that's it.

28:53.934 --> 28:55.834
- Life is about wherever
you gon' get to...

28:59.200 --> 29:01.500
- Suppose you wouldn't want
to trade that service spoon

29:01.500 --> 29:03.033
for a telephone,
O'Reily,

29:03.033 --> 29:04.567
come on over
and join our company?

29:04.567 --> 29:05.900
Yeah, that'd be
a dream come true,

29:05.900 --> 29:07.734
pissing off strangers
at dinnertime.

29:07.734 --> 29:09.600
- Ain't no money
in the kitchen.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.100
- That's why my middle name
is "Subsidize."

29:23.934 --> 29:25.500
- Hello, boys.

29:25.500 --> 29:29.266
You fellas are new here
in Oz, right?

29:29.266 --> 29:34.000
Haven't really had
a chance to settle in yet.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.800
Well, rather than get involved
in all the tribal shit

29:36.800 --> 29:38.400
that goes
on around here,

29:38.400 --> 29:42.767
you need to know
that these days,

29:42.767 --> 29:45.433
Oz has a better
place to turn.

29:45.433 --> 29:46.834
Mm-hmm.

29:46.834 --> 29:50.033
It's called
employment.

29:50.033 --> 29:51.066
- I heard about that.

29:51.066 --> 29:53.033
You with
that guy Arif?

29:53.033 --> 29:54.834
- No.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.400
I'm with me,
Burr Redding.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.934
Telemarketing.

29:57.934 --> 30:00.867
- I'm gonna try and get seconds
before they shut down.

30:00.867 --> 30:04.166
- For all
the flak it gets,

30:04.166 --> 30:07.734
a sales position
in telemarketing

30:07.734 --> 30:10.033
is a fine way to keep
yourself active.

30:10.033 --> 30:13.900
- I just remembered, I got a
appointment with Sister Pete.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.633
- What about you?

30:17.633 --> 30:19.000
You gotta go jerk off
or something?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.133
- No, I mean,
I'd take the job.

30:21.133 --> 30:23.300
- Oh, good boy.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.767
- But I'm dyslexic.

30:29.233 --> 30:32.700
- Here, clear my tray,
you squirmy little maggot.

30:51.467 --> 30:55.000
- Yo, boss man,
this be payday.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.934
- Yeah, I--I know.

30:56.934 --> 30:58.567
- Where's my money?

30:58.567 --> 31:01.367
- You're gonna have to wait
till the end of next week.

31:01.367 --> 31:03.033
- What?

31:03.033 --> 31:05.266
- I'm waiting on a check
from one of the publishers,

31:05.266 --> 31:07.033
and when it clears,
I'll have your money for you.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.266
Just trust me.

31:08.266 --> 31:09.467
- Trust you?

31:09.467 --> 31:12.367
Fuck.

31:13.867 --> 31:15.233
Excuse me.

31:17.433 --> 31:19.333
- I'm telling you, Poet,

31:19.333 --> 31:20.934
except for the money
I've been stealin',

31:20.934 --> 31:22.967
I'm stone-cold broke.

31:22.967 --> 31:24.667
We cannot wait
any longer, man.

31:24.667 --> 31:26.667
We've got to get back
to selling tits.

31:26.667 --> 31:29.734
- I'm way ahead of you,
Reggie, way ahead of you.

31:29.734 --> 31:31.734
Got a little contact
on the outside,

31:31.734 --> 31:33.400
my nigga sky bar.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.467
Shipment coming
in today.

31:35.467 --> 31:37.100
- All right, my dogs.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.400
- All right?

31:38.400 --> 31:39.500
- Ah-ha, yes!

31:39.500 --> 31:41.467
- Hey, Poet.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.533
It's too bad about
your friend Sky Bar.

31:43.533 --> 31:44.867
- What about him?

31:44.867 --> 31:46.233
- Oh, you didn't hear?

31:46.233 --> 31:47.533
Got run over
by a Chevy...

31:47.533 --> 31:50.400
37 times.

32:03.834 --> 32:07.133
Augustus Hill: Prisoner number
9-7-G-1-4-1,

32:07.133 --> 32:08.700
Samuel Gougeon...

32:10.400 --> 32:13.433
Convicted august 5, 1997,
manslaughter.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.500
Sentence, 19 years.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.734
Up for parole in 10.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.100
- But let me
tell you about

32:22.100 --> 32:23.800
the greatest
political campaign of all,

32:23.800 --> 32:27.367
"Jesus' love", and God himself
is running for office.

32:27.367 --> 32:29.166
- Put that phone down,
choir boy!

32:29.166 --> 32:32.734
That's just straight-up
fucking dumb,

32:32.734 --> 32:37.100
using my workplace as a front
for your gospel-mongering.

32:37.100 --> 32:38.533
- I'm sorry, I--

32:38.533 --> 32:39.633
- oh, yeah, no shit.

32:39.633 --> 32:42.166
And now,
you're going to repent.

32:42.166 --> 32:44.467
Mmm.

32:44.467 --> 32:47.066
I've got
a special job for you.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.567
- I guess this is one of
those times you don't ask,

32:52.567 --> 32:54.800
what would Jesus do?

33:00.867 --> 33:02.600
Make it fast.

33:04.533 --> 33:08.066
- For I acknowledge
my transgressions and my sin--

33:09.066 --> 33:10.800
is ever before me.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.467
Bless me, oh father,
according to thy loving kindness

33:14.467 --> 33:20.500
and according to the multitude
of thy tender mercies.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.700
- It was you,
wasn't it?

33:30.700 --> 33:33.300
- Come inside, Arif.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.333
- You're a pathetic,
corrupt man, Redding.

33:36.333 --> 33:37.667
You know what?

33:37.667 --> 33:38.900
- The corrupt part, I do.

33:38.900 --> 33:40.467
I wouldn't say
pathetic, though.

33:40.467 --> 33:42.867
- Vandalizing my business
to repopulate yours?

33:42.867 --> 33:44.066
What do you call that?

33:44.066 --> 33:46.300
- Downsizing for
the overall good.

33:46.300 --> 33:48.433
- This is your chance
to go to Glynn

33:48.433 --> 33:50.066
and tell the truth
before I do.

33:50.066 --> 33:52.734
- Nobody's going
to anyone, son.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.567
Business wasn't
very good, was it?

33:56.567 --> 33:59.000
- How would you
know that?

33:59.000 --> 34:02.367
- On Wall Street,
we call it reconnaissance.

34:02.367 --> 34:06.033
And you ought
to be grateful to me.

34:06.033 --> 34:08.667
Now, you can collect
your insurance

34:08.667 --> 34:11.834
and get all that money back
your Muslim brothers have lost.

34:11.834 --> 34:16.734
And you can put all that
aggravation behind you.

34:16.734 --> 34:18.333
Hmm?

34:19.900 --> 34:22.934
Don't mention it.

34:22.934 --> 34:24.066
- Did he confess?

34:24.066 --> 34:25.433
- I need time to think.

34:25.433 --> 34:26.834
- What's there
to think about?

34:26.834 --> 34:27.834
He's guilty, right?

34:27.834 --> 34:29.467
- No.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.200
What happened to our machinery
was an accident.

34:36.100 --> 34:39.900
- 13 years after banging
the opposite side of the gavel,

34:39.900 --> 34:42.166
the Supreme Court
did an about-face

34:42.166 --> 34:44.867
and decided last June
to bar the death penalty

34:44.867 --> 34:47.200
on retarded defendants.

34:47.200 --> 34:49.300
"The large number
of states

34:49.300 --> 34:52.100
"prohibiting the execution
of mentally retarded persons

34:52.100 --> 34:54.667
"provides powerful evidence
that today

34:54.667 --> 34:57.767
"our society views
mentally retarded offenders

34:57.767 --> 35:02.433
as categorically less culpable
than the average criminal."

35:05.934 --> 35:07.567
- So, how's Cyril doing?

35:07.567 --> 35:09.967
- He hasn't defecated
on himself again,

35:09.967 --> 35:12.333
and he's
sleeping a lot.

35:12.333 --> 35:14.100
- How much is a lot?

35:14.100 --> 35:16.433
- In and out,
all day long.

35:16.433 --> 35:17.767
- Oh.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.100
Maybe that's
a good thing.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.767
You know, I mean,
we're still waiting to hear

35:20.767 --> 35:22.300
about the stay from
the state Supreme Court,

35:22.300 --> 35:23.667
but, I don't know,
I mean, if we don't get one,

35:23.667 --> 35:26.200
maybe he can just nap
up until the time

35:26.200 --> 35:27.667
when they put him
to sleep for good.

35:27.667 --> 35:33.266
- Ryan, lethal injection
isn't just falling asleep.

35:33.266 --> 35:34.900
- What do you mean?

35:34.900 --> 35:39.367
- It definitely makes execution
easier on the public,

35:39.367 --> 35:40.967
easier on the staff,

35:40.967 --> 35:44.133
but we don't really know how
painful lethal injection is.

35:44.133 --> 35:47.333
What I can tell you
is a little-known fact

35:47.333 --> 35:49.000
that it was invented
by the Nazis.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.500
- What?

35:50.500 --> 35:52.700
- Hitler's personal physician
devised the procedure

35:52.700 --> 35:54.233
as a means
to kill off children

35:54.233 --> 35:56.333
and eventually used it
on adults as well.

35:56.333 --> 35:57.800
- Hitler?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.900
- Given the concern
those bastards had for mercy.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.333
- No, I just--

36:02.333 --> 36:05.767
I just want what's best
for Cyril, that's all.

36:05.767 --> 36:11.500
- Well, I was wondering
if maybe the electric chair

36:11.500 --> 36:12.900
wouldn't be
the better way to go.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.500
- The chair?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.800
Why not just feed him
to the fuckin' lions?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.133
- Think about it.

36:18.133 --> 36:21.300
I mean, he's had
electroshock therapy,

36:21.300 --> 36:25.133
which isn't such a far cry
from electrocution.

36:25.133 --> 36:28.333
I mean, at least in his mind
it wouldn't have to be.

36:28.333 --> 36:31.400
By now, he's used to the straps
and the electrodes.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.166
Just tell him he's going in
for a special session.

36:38.233 --> 36:40.266
He might never know
the difference.

36:43.567 --> 36:44.667
- Fuck.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.934
- Hey.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.800
Psst.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.467
Come on, Cyril,
wake up.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.567
- Hmm.

37:16.567 --> 37:19.867
- So, you want the good news
first or the bad news?

37:19.867 --> 37:21.834
- The good news.

37:21.834 --> 37:23.500
- All right.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.333
The good news is you're going
to have your last ECT session

37:26.333 --> 37:27.433
in a couple of days.

37:27.433 --> 37:29.800
- Why is this
the last session?

37:29.800 --> 37:32.100
- Well, because you've been
such a champ so far, you know.

37:32.100 --> 37:35.300
And because you've
been so great,

37:35.300 --> 37:38.266
they're gonna
move you back upstairs.

37:38.266 --> 37:40.200
They're gonna fix up
your cell all special-like,

37:40.200 --> 37:42.233
and they're gonna
give you a TV, hmm?

37:42.233 --> 37:46.000
- Really?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.400
- Yeah.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.734
- I can watch
what I want?

37:49.734 --> 37:51.200
- What we want, bro.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.800
I'm gonna be
there with you.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.667
- You are?

37:54.667 --> 37:56.834
- Yeah, and um...

37:56.834 --> 37:59.867
They're gonna make you
this big dinner

37:59.867 --> 38:02.233
where you can eat
whatever you like.

38:02.233 --> 38:06.567
- I can have
a fluffernutter?

38:06.567 --> 38:08.467
- You can have
two fluffernutters.

38:08.467 --> 38:12.100
- I can have
two fluffernutters.

38:15.633 --> 38:18.000
- So, you want to hear
the bad news?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.667
- All right.

38:20.667 --> 38:24.266
- They've got to--

38:24.266 --> 38:25.800
they've got
to cut your hair.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.367
- Why, I like my hair?

38:29.367 --> 38:33.100
- I know you do, buddy,
but for this last session,

38:33.100 --> 38:34.867
they've got to cut it,
I'm sorry.

38:34.867 --> 38:37.667
- Will it grow back?

38:46.066 --> 38:47.967
- Homey, you put
Rapunzel to shame.

38:47.967 --> 38:51.967
- It's gonna grow back,
right, Ryan?

38:51.967 --> 38:53.567
- Yeah, right.

38:53.567 --> 38:56.200
- Fingernails gonna
grow down there, too.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.133
Gonna go from
Rapunzel to Elvira.

38:59.133 --> 39:02.166
- Yo, homey,
come on, man.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.433
Just focus on
the hair, all right?

39:04.433 --> 39:07.867
We don't need
a color commentary, okay?

39:07.867 --> 39:10.133
Actually,
you know what?

39:10.133 --> 39:11.700
Let me get
a few snips in.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.600
I've been wanting
to do this for years.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.633
Holy shit.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.834
God damn it, Cyril,
I can see your face again,

39:28.834 --> 39:31.400
you handsome fuck.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.934
- Ryan, look.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.600
- Listen...

40:14.600 --> 40:18.166
I haven't been very friendly
since I got to Oz,

40:18.166 --> 40:20.934
but now,
I've talked to Suzanne,

40:20.934 --> 40:23.166
I'm aware of how hard
you've tried

40:23.166 --> 40:24.900
to stop your
brother's execution.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.567
I admire
your efforts.

40:27.567 --> 40:32.800
I want you to know
at the hour of his death,

40:32.800 --> 40:35.900
everyone in Em City
will be with him.

40:35.900 --> 40:39.166
- Oh, yeah?

40:39.166 --> 40:40.934
How?

40:40.934 --> 40:42.500
- You'll see.

40:44.633 --> 40:47.000
- Let's go, O'Reily.

40:59.133 --> 41:01.000
- Any word yet from
the state Supreme Court?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.166
- No, you'll stay in
your brother's cell tonight.

41:03.166 --> 41:04.567
And then when they
take him downstairs,

41:04.567 --> 41:05.900
we'll bring you
back here.

41:05.900 --> 41:07.600
- I was wondering if
at the time of his death,

41:07.600 --> 41:09.166
you know,
I could be alone?

41:09.166 --> 41:11.333
- Stay in your pod?

41:11.333 --> 41:12.800
- I--I was thinking maybe I
could walk

41:12.800 --> 41:14.600
in your meditation maze.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.667
- All right.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.266
- Following a particularly
heated trial,

41:21.266 --> 41:24.500
which seems to have only
magnified the disagreement

41:24.500 --> 41:27.033
on the execution of
the mentally challenged.

41:27.033 --> 41:29.800
So, this afternoon
at Oswald Penitentiary--

41:30.900 --> 41:32.467
- What was that
about Oz?

41:32.467 --> 41:33.500
- Nothing.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.767
- Why does that man keep
watching me and taking notes?

41:46.767 --> 41:49.300
- It's part of
the last ECT session.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.533
They always do that.

41:54.967 --> 41:57.800
- I think I have
a stomachache.

41:57.800 --> 42:01.967
- It's all that fluff
and stuff, you big freak.

42:01.967 --> 42:06.567
Hey, what do you say
we lie down for a little while,

42:06.567 --> 42:08.600
you know,
get a snooze in?

42:26.867 --> 42:31.700
- I forgot to ask
for Rolaids.

42:37.767 --> 42:40.367
Are you okay, Ryan?

42:40.367 --> 42:43.000
- Yeah.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.066
As long as
you are, buddy.

42:59.100 --> 43:01.433
- Each individual state
has to decide if a person

43:01.433 --> 43:03.033
is retarded or not,

43:03.033 --> 43:05.266
meaning a murderer could get
a life sentence in Maine

43:05.266 --> 43:06.834
where he's
considered retarded,

43:06.834 --> 43:10.633
but the gas chamber in Iowa
where he's normal enough to die.

43:10.633 --> 43:14.600
Same guy,
same problems, same crime,

43:14.600 --> 43:17.266
two opposite fates
depending on

43:17.266 --> 43:19.000
which invisible state line
he crosses.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.934
Guilt and innocence,

43:20.934 --> 43:22.834
hell, one's entire identity

43:22.834 --> 43:25.867
is now a matter of
geography.

43:31.734 --> 43:33.867
- One thing I didn't
tell you, Cyril,

43:33.867 --> 43:36.166
there's going to be other people
there today watching.

43:36.166 --> 43:39.000
- Who?

43:39.000 --> 43:42.667
- Oh, let's see,
the warden,

43:42.667 --> 43:47.600
Sister Pete,
Ma, Dr. Nathan

43:47.600 --> 43:49.400
and a few other people
you probably won't recognize.

43:49.400 --> 43:52.734
- Oh.

43:52.734 --> 43:55.166
Are you gonna
be there?

44:01.033 --> 44:03.266
No, I want to,
but I can't.

44:03.266 --> 44:06.100
- Why?

44:15.900 --> 44:21.800
- Daddy said, it's not good
for big boys to cry.

44:22.100 --> 44:24.834
- Yeah, well,
you know what?

44:24.834 --> 44:26.200
Dad was wrong,

44:26.200 --> 44:27.600
and I was wrong.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.867
We were all
so fucking wrong, Cyril.

44:30.867 --> 44:32.300
Man, I'm so sorry.

44:39.467 --> 44:42.433
- Did I do something?

44:42.433 --> 44:44.767
- No.

44:44.767 --> 44:46.934
No.

44:46.934 --> 44:52.033
Dr. Nathan, she said
I got this condition, right,

44:52.033 --> 44:58.133
and the only way for me
to cure myself is to cry.

44:58.133 --> 45:01.333
You know, it's got nothing
to do with you.

45:01.333 --> 45:03.266
I'm sorry,
don't be scared, okay?

45:15.667 --> 45:19.266
- Whoops, I think
I got gas from dinner.

45:19.900 --> 45:22.700
Mom.
- Hi.

45:22.700 --> 45:26.166
Any word from Zelman?

45:26.166 --> 45:27.367
- No.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.600
Hey.

45:33.100 --> 45:35.000
- You look pretty.

45:37.300 --> 45:38.700
- Sit down.

45:38.700 --> 45:41.834
I want to teach you this
little prayer that I know.

45:41.834 --> 45:45.200
It goes something
like this, it goes...

45:47.967 --> 45:50.000
- Hey.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.533
There's probably not
a chance I can get a copy

45:51.533 --> 45:54.000
of that journal
you're writing in, can I?

45:54.000 --> 45:55.900
- Afraid not.

45:55.900 --> 45:57.834
- No, just a...

45:57.834 --> 46:02.166
You know, one quick stop
by the copy machine, you know.

46:02.166 --> 46:03.600
No one's got to know.

46:03.600 --> 46:04.900
I swear to God,
I won't show it to anyone.

46:04.900 --> 46:07.834
I promise.

46:07.834 --> 46:10.000
- Your time is up.

46:20.967 --> 46:25.967
- Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me.

46:25.967 --> 46:28.467
- Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me.

46:28.467 --> 46:32.133
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me.

46:32.133 --> 46:33.367
Hey, come on.

46:33.367 --> 46:36.266
We have to go.
- Amen.

46:47.066 --> 46:49.200
- Hey.

46:49.200 --> 46:52.133
Who loves you, man?

46:52.133 --> 46:53.600
- You do.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.967
- Oh, that's right.

46:54.967 --> 46:57.367
More than you'll
ever fuckin' know.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.834
Listen, I just need you
to relax, okay?

47:00.834 --> 47:02.066
You know,
you get scared,

47:02.066 --> 47:05.000
you just think
about me, all right?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.300
Okay.

47:06.300 --> 47:08.834
My boy.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.433
- What?

47:21.433 --> 47:23.700
- Nothing.

47:31.667 --> 47:33.767
- These are the clothes
you asked for.

47:33.767 --> 47:37.133
- I didn't ask
for any clothes.

47:37.133 --> 47:40.800
Is that Ryan's shirt?

47:44.900 --> 47:46.133
He said
I could wear it?

47:51.066 --> 47:53.734
- There's widespread agreement
that retarded people

47:53.734 --> 47:55.500
are less accountable
for their crimes

47:55.500 --> 47:57.266
than those of
average intelligence.

47:57.266 --> 47:59.133
But if so,

47:59.133 --> 48:01.400
something or someone
has to be held accountable,

48:01.400 --> 48:02.834
has to pick up the slack

48:02.834 --> 48:04.934
and take the rest of
the blame, right?

48:04.934 --> 48:07.967
After all, these victims
still die heinous deaths

48:07.967 --> 48:09.633
and families
still grieve.

48:09.633 --> 48:12.600
If the retarded person
is not fully at fault,

48:12.600 --> 48:15.233
then who or what shares
the responsibility?

48:15.233 --> 48:16.700
God?

48:16.700 --> 48:19.433
Human nature?
Society?

48:19.433 --> 48:21.233
Maybe the question is,

48:21.233 --> 48:23.934
who isn't to blame?

48:27.333 --> 48:29.400
- Why do I have
to wear these?

48:29.400 --> 48:30.867
Where are my shoes?

48:30.867 --> 48:33.834
- Hello, Cyril.

48:33.834 --> 48:35.100
- Hi.

48:35.100 --> 48:37.400
Don't I need my shoes?

49:12.967 --> 49:14.734
- Yea, though I walk
through the valley

49:14.734 --> 49:16.266
of the shadow of death,

49:16.266 --> 49:18.834
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

49:18.834 --> 49:21.567
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

49:21.567 --> 49:25.100
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

49:25.100 --> 49:27.367
Thou anointest
my head with oil.

49:27.367 --> 49:29.233
My cup runneth over.

49:29.233 --> 49:32.066
Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me

49:32.066 --> 49:33.533
all the days
of my life,

49:33.533 --> 49:35.400
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

49:42.200 --> 49:45.033

warden Glynn.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.467
Uh-huh.

53:43.467 --> 53:45.133
Right.

53:45.133 --> 53:48.100
Okay.

53:59.233 --> 54:01.667
By the order of
the state Supreme Court,

54:01.667 --> 54:05.100
Cyril O'Reily has
been granted a stay,

54:05.100 --> 54:08.066
based on newfound merit
in his appeal.

54:08.066 --> 54:10.967
This sentence
has been postponed

54:10.967 --> 54:13.266
until further notice.

54:29.667 --> 54:30.834
- What happened?

54:30.834 --> 54:33.000
What about
the special session?

54:36.900 --> 54:39.734
- Flash back to 1989
when the Supreme Court

54:39.734 --> 54:41.700
first weighed in
on this issue.

54:41.700 --> 54:44.767
Based on evolving standards
of decency that mark

54:44.767 --> 54:47.800
the progress of
a maturing society,

54:47.800 --> 54:50.533
there is not
sufficient evidence present

54:50.533 --> 54:54.333
of a national consensus
against such executions.

54:54.333 --> 54:57.066
Well, supposedly today,
there is.

54:57.066 --> 55:00.133
Polls show most Americans
agree that an adult

55:00.133 --> 55:01.600
with the mind
of a third-grader

55:01.600 --> 55:03.500
should not be
on death row.

55:03.500 --> 55:06.834
But are we
a maturing society

55:06.834 --> 55:09.367
with evolving standards
of decency?

55:09.367 --> 55:12.533
Who's to say we're
any further along

55:12.533 --> 55:14.934
than some cosmic equivalent
of third grade?

55:14.934 --> 55:17.233
Who's to say,
we, as a whole,

55:17.233 --> 55:19.100
aren't retarded?

55:31.266 --> 55:32.867
Thank you.
