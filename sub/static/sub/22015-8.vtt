00:06.540 --> 00:07.441
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.742 --> 00:10.344
sexually based offenses

00:10.378 --> 00:12.180
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.117
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
are members of an elite squad

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.089
These are their stories.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.623
[dramatic musical sting]

00:22.656 --> 00:26.194
- Ava forgot her snack,
so I gave her one of my apples.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.263
- That's very nice.
A gentleman always shares.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.665
- Mommy!
- Hey, sweet boy.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.267
Oh, how was school?

00:33.301 --> 00:35.336
- Great.
- Good.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.405
- Thank you.
Thank you for picking him up.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.740
- Thank you.
I love my time with Noah.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.275
- You're staying
for dinner, I hope.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.543
- Oh, gosh, no, thank you.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.145
I'm having some plants
delivered.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.147
I know it's just
a furnished Airbnb,

00:46.180 --> 00:47.781
but I need a little green.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.583
- You know that you're
welcome any time.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.119
- Thank you.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.820
- Right, Noah?
- Yeah.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.588
- Good.
Okay, honey, say good-bye.

00:54.622 --> 00:58.826
- Bye, Grandma Sheila.
- Bye, little man.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.562
Thank you.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.098
- So, Noah, huh?

01:04.132 --> 01:06.200
Looks like you're having fun
with Grandma Sheila.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.869
- Yeah, she's nice.
- Yeah.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.340
- I wish I got to meet Ellie.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.342
- Sorry, honey,
what did you say?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.244
What did Grandma Sheila say?

01:16.277 --> 01:19.413
- She said that Ellie
loved me so much.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.191
- It's called Pink Ice.
[phone pings]

01:30.224 --> 01:32.893
- Um, are you sure?
I don't see it.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.862
- We have to get out of KC.

01:34.895 --> 01:38.799
[pop music]

01:38.832 --> 01:41.202
Oh, it's called Blue Glacier.

01:41.235 --> 01:44.138
- You were close.
[phone pings]

01:44.172 --> 01:46.140

01:55.216 --> 01:58.452
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi, were you waiting long?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.488
I'm sorry.
- Nah, it's fine.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.857
I got here early.
[phone pings]

02:03.891 --> 02:05.893
How was Argentina?
- Wow, close,

02:05.926 --> 02:07.495
I think you mean Pensacola.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.796
I was just visiting my parents,
so, you know,

02:08.829 --> 02:10.664
nothing special.

02:10.698 --> 02:14.402
- This is me.
- Oh, wow, I was expecting

02:14.435 --> 02:16.470
something bigger.
[laughs]

02:16.504 --> 02:19.173
- Yeah, I was thinking
we'd take it easy tonight.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.608
My place?
Get to know each other

02:20.641 --> 02:21.709
a little better?

02:21.742 --> 02:24.512
- Are you taking me straight
home on a first date?

02:24.545 --> 02:26.747
'Cause you should really
buy me a meal first.

02:28.416 --> 02:34.655
I'm kidding.
It's perfect.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.262
- Katy's guy has a Range Rover.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.197
Um, Stevie has a bicycle.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.232
- Broom him.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.368
[laughter]

02:47.401 --> 02:50.604
- To something new.

02:50.638 --> 02:54.942
Mm, come on.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.311
This ought to keep
everyone busy.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.679
They love cryptic stuff.

02:58.712 --> 03:02.616
#WhoIsTheHand?
[laughs]

03:02.650 --> 03:05.519
- I'll never tell.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.756
- Wow, all this just
for knocking the snot

03:08.789 --> 03:11.525
out of a couple
of mouth-breathers, huh?

03:14.528 --> 03:17.931
Oh, this thing weighs
more than I do.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.833
I wanna see you wear it.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.736
- Maybe later.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.272
But first...

03:25.005 --> 03:28.742
- Whoa, that was fast.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.944
I think we should just
take it slow--

03:30.978 --> 03:34.315
[grunts]
- You know you want it.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.850
- Oh, my God, no!
No!

03:36.884 --> 03:38.886
No!

03:38.919 --> 03:44.625
Andy, please, stop!
No!

03:44.658 --> 03:49.263
No!
No!

03:57.004 --> 04:00.474
- Hey, are you okay?

04:00.508 --> 04:01.875
- No.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.644
I was raped.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.819
- You better come with me, now.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.020
- Whoa, whoa, what's the rush?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.488
- The vic's talking
about leaving.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.023
- Leaving?
Was she raped or not?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.891
- Depends what time
you ask her.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.560
Her name's Katy Miller.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.028
- Okay.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.497
Hi, Katy,
I'm Detective Rollins.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.965
This is Detective Tutuola.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.501
- Excuse me, you told
the officer you were raped.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.670
- Nope.
- You didn't say that?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.505
- It's not what you think.
[phone pings]

04:31.539 --> 04:32.873
- Okay, what is it then?

04:32.906 --> 04:34.508
- I just wanna go home.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.510
- You know, I get it.
I know it's all confusing,

04:36.544 --> 04:38.779
but if you don't let
the doctors examine you,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.348
collect evidence now,
then you're not gonna have

04:40.381 --> 04:41.715
many options later.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.784
- I don't need options because
I wasn't raped, okay?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.886
Can you please get that
through your heads?

04:51.425 --> 04:54.395
[dramatic music]

05:37.838 --> 05:38.406
- She refused the rape kit?

05:39.540 --> 05:40.974
- She said she wasn't raped.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.510
- After she said she was raped.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.877
- Well, if it's
the same Katy Miller,

05:43.911 --> 05:45.579
then she's a social media
celebrity--Instagram,

05:45.613 --> 05:46.847
YouTube, Snap.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.449
She's got a couple
hundred thousand followers.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.117
- Thank you, Kim Kardashian.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.486
- Sure, make mock,
but these influencers

05:52.520 --> 05:53.787
are the voice of Gen Z.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.489
- And they're getting
rich doing it.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.758
Don't people know
porn's free these day?

05:58.726 --> 06:01.529
- This Blue Glacier shampoo,
my sister uses that.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.597
- Okay, is there a photo
from last night?

06:03.631 --> 06:05.933
- Just this one posted
at 9:15 p.m.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.001
There's no geotag,
no meta-data.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.470
- Well, it looks like Tribeca.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.771
- That's where the uni
picked her up.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.706
- Okay, anything with
a face attached?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.575
- Nope, not yet, but I still
got 10,000 pics to go through.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.678
- Okay, so what happened
between the time she disclosed

06:17.711 --> 06:18.712
and the time she denied?

06:18.746 --> 06:21.014
- She was texting
the whole time we were there.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.684
- Could mean she was
being pressured.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.823
You don't look happy.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.526
- It shows?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.027
I don't know if things
are gonna work out

06:34.061 --> 06:35.663
with Sheila and me.

06:35.696 --> 06:39.433
- Things?
- You know, I've never had a--

06:39.467 --> 06:42.135
what you'd call
a normal family life.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.638
It'd just be nice
if somebody had my back.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.675
- Doesn't sound good.
You know we got your back here.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.443
- Yeah, I know.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.547
[doorbell rings]

06:53.581 --> 06:55.483
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

06:55.516 --> 06:56.684
- We just wanna talk, Katy.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.886
This is Lieutenant Benson.
- Hey.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.088
- Big gun.
I told you, nothing happened.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.556
You don't have to
worry about me.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.157
- You don't have to
worry about us.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.659
Look, Katy, you were
in the hospital,

07:05.693 --> 07:07.861
so it's standard for us
to follow up.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.831
- [sighs]

07:11.865 --> 07:13.934
- There's no way
I could afford living by myself

07:13.967 --> 07:16.169
when I was your age.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.705
- Yeah, I get a discount
if I tweet

07:17.738 --> 07:19.673
the realtor's website
once a month.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.909
Beats the hell out of a dorm.
- You're still in school?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.944
- Yeah, I got a late start,
but this pays for it,

07:23.977 --> 07:26.146
and dorms are filled with
little boys who like to look.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.482
- Any of that still going on
since you moved out?

07:28.516 --> 07:30.818
- Nothing that doesn't come
with the territory.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.021
Now, I post what gets likes,
which equals ad revenue,

07:34.054 --> 07:37.024
which equals this apartment,
paying for college,

07:37.057 --> 07:38.926
sending money to my parents--
- But posting photos

07:38.959 --> 07:42.095
doesn't give anyone
the right to rape you.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.697
- These from your Instagram?

07:43.731 --> 07:46.033
- Yeah.
Some framing app sent me those,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.568
hoping I'll post
a picture of them.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.671
Then they'll frame that,
then I'll repost it.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.506
- Who's the guy
with the tattoos?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.575
- No one,
just some MMA fighter.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.545
- Oh, that's The Monster.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.013
- Oh, when--when'd you
meet him?

08:00.047 --> 08:02.082
- Uh, a couple months ago for,
like, two seconds

08:02.115 --> 08:04.251
after a fight.
I don't know why I was there.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.886
I deleted that post.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.989
- When's the last time you were
in touch with him?

08:09.022 --> 08:12.593
- Katy, you posted a picture
of yourself last night

08:12.626 --> 08:17.631
with a guy with tattoos,
so did The Monster rape you?

08:17.665 --> 08:20.167
- I told you.
I wasn't raped.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.669
Are we done here?

08:21.702 --> 08:22.870
My lawyer says
I don't have to talk to you.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.137
- Your lawyer?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.238
- He said he'll help me
navigate this

08:25.272 --> 08:26.273
to protect my career.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.875
- Katy, we are your advocates.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.610
You don't need a lawyer now.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.179
- He said you'd say that.

08:32.212 --> 08:36.049
I've made my decision,
and I don't wanna move forward.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.552
Can you please leave?

08:44.157 --> 08:47.294
- I'm sorry, I've still never
heard of Katy Miller.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.763
- Well, she said that
she was raped last night,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.231
and that you told her
not to talk to us.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.900
- Why would I do that?

08:52.933 --> 08:55.669
- Celebrity defendant--
fast cash in a civil suit.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.672
- The perp has money?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.574
- If you never talked to Katy,

09:00.608 --> 09:02.710
why would she give us
your name?

09:02.743 --> 09:05.813
- My stellar rep
in the legal community.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.682
- So she wasn't just texting.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.217
She was looking up
some random lawyer's name.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.752
- Starting with the A's.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.320
- Doubt she's majoring
in brain surgery.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.288
- Only way she even thinks
about calling a lawyer

09:15.322 --> 09:17.691
is if somebody's pressuring her
to shut up.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.226
- Somebody like The Monster?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.261
- Liv said she definitely
didn't want to talk about him.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.063
[phone buzzes]

09:23.096 --> 09:24.632
Fin.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.200
You're kidding me.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.302
We're on our way.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.005
Liv said she got a call
from Andy McPherson,

09:32.039 --> 09:33.306
AKA The Monster.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.643
He says he wants
to talk to us right away.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.749
- [grunting]

09:41.782 --> 09:45.786
[thudding]

09:47.120 --> 09:50.023
- Tattoos at 12 o'clock.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.659
- [grunts]

09:52.392 --> 09:55.228
- Ten guesses why they call him
The Monster.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.830
- Yo, you guys NYPD?

09:56.864 --> 09:58.966
- Yes, sir, Mr. McPherson said
he wanted to talk to us.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.668
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm Shawn Tompkins,

10:00.701 --> 10:02.002
his lawyer/manager.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.904
Look, he's got a $20 million
fight on the line

10:03.937 --> 10:05.372
and this whackadoodle chick's
got him spun.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.208
- We'd like to hear that
from him.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.710
- Hey, yo, Andy.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.713
- [grunts]
Take ten.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.349
- What we talked about.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.252
- Yeah, so we had a date
last night, me and Katy.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.788
- The Internet whore.
- Hey, stop it.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.055
- What?
She's famous for taking off

10:22.089 --> 10:23.256
her clothes.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.726
- You have sex?
- Yeah, sure.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.761
And it was rough,
but it was consensual.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.329
Then she sends me this
an hour ago.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.999
- This is why we called you.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.669
- "Pay me $10,000, or I'll tell
the cops you raped me."

10:45.145 --> 10:45.278
.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.113
- Apparently I met Katy
at my last fight

10:47.748 --> 10:49.149
a couple months ago--
I didn't remember.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.318
But then she commented
on my fan page.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.722
I liked what I saw, so
I sent her my private number.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.990
We started texting, whatnot...

10:57.024 --> 10:58.225
- Whatnot?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.993
- I mean, she seemed
pretty cool at first.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.330
We both like Waylon Jennings,
Johnny Cash.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.866
She's a smart girl.
She's going to college

11:05.899 --> 11:08.902
and working to pay
for herself and her folks.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.171
Then she tells me how
she used to be shy

11:11.204 --> 11:13.306
and got picked on
in middle school,

11:13.340 --> 11:16.009
and then I was like, "This is
someone I could be with."

11:17.344 --> 11:18.946
- Looks like there may be
a heart somewhere

11:18.979 --> 11:20.447
under all those muscles.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.015
- Then it got weird.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.918
- Weird how?
- Sexual.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.755
She told me that she gets
turned on by watching me fight.

11:27.788 --> 11:32.225
She sends me a bunch of selfies
wearing not a lot of clothing,

11:32.259 --> 11:36.964
and then she says
she wanted me to rape her.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.200
- I told you to back off
that chick, didn't I?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.069
Show 'em.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.843
- "I want to be pinned down
and forced, and there's nothing

11:49.877 --> 11:50.944
I can do to get away."

11:50.978 --> 11:52.379
You say,
"You're kidding, right?"

11:52.412 --> 11:56.416
She says, "No, Monster.
I want you to rape me."

11:56.449 --> 11:59.186
- All I did is
what she asked for.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.021
- So you're admitting
that you raped her.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.189
- Of course
he's not saying that.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.857
- But you forced her
to have sex.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.793
- Yeah.
No.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.994
I don't know.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.195
It's what she wanted, man.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.097
- Look, the girl's
not only a perv--

12:10.130 --> 12:13.767
she's a con artist.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.838
- Somebody's not telling
the truth.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.339
- Katy already lied
to us twice.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.208
- And there's a reason
they call this guy The Monster.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.843
- Well, it could have something
to do with the fact

12:22.876 --> 12:25.078
that he's undefeated
with 28 first round knockouts.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.882
Yeah, I dabble, and I just--
I think it's weird

12:28.916 --> 12:30.517
that Katy only asked
for $10,000.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.352
He's worth millions.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.823
- So have The Monster text Katy
back, agree to pay the money.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.791
If she shows, she's a felon.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.259
- And if she doesn't show up?

12:39.292 --> 12:42.529
- Charge Monster with rape one.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.132
- It's "The Monster," FYI.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.478
- Still nothing.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.949
- She'll be here.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.284
- I don't know--
she's 20 minutes late.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.153
Maybe she spotted us.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.260
I got eyes on her.
Southwest entrance.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.563
She's walking towards him.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.844
- She spotted him.

13:35.883 --> 13:36.850
[car horn blares]

13:36.884 --> 13:37.985
[tires squeal]

13:38.018 --> 13:39.219
- Whoa, what are you doing?

13:39.252 --> 13:40.320
- I'm arresting you
for extortion.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.321
- No, no, I didn't do anything.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.522
- Then why'd you run?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.024
- Because I saw him!

13:44.057 --> 13:45.158
- How could you be
such a bitch, huh?

13:45.192 --> 13:47.294
You set me up!
- That's enough.

13:49.329 --> 13:53.400
- Demanding money in exchange
for not reporting a crime?

13:53.433 --> 13:56.369
That's a crime, Katy.
It's called extortion.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.871
- I didn't do that.
I have no idea

13:57.905 --> 13:58.906
what you're talking about.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.240
- Why were you at the park?

14:00.273 --> 14:01.875
- I had an interview
for a modeling gig.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.311
A rep from Chanel asked me
to meet her there.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.880
- At Stuyvesant Park
at 1:00 p.m. on a Sunday?

14:06.914 --> 14:09.449
- You don't believe me.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.550
Look.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.320
- "Hey, Katy, love your Insta.
Chanel is developing

14:13.353 --> 14:16.056
a new ad campaign
you'd be perfect for."

14:16.089 --> 14:17.991
- See?
I didn't ask anyone for money.

14:18.025 --> 14:22.062
- Okay, Katy, we saw the texts
that you sent to The Monster.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.231
- Well, then,
he's setting me up.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.899
He told me that
he would come after me

14:25.933 --> 14:27.067
if I went to the police.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.635
- Show me right now.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.507
"What the hell happened?
You'd better not tell

14:34.541 --> 14:37.110
"anyone about this.
If you go to the cops,

14:37.144 --> 14:38.946
"your career is over.
I'll tell everyone

14:38.979 --> 14:42.382
what a slut you are,
and no one will believe you."

14:44.384 --> 14:48.188
- Katy, did he rape you?

14:49.222 --> 14:50.357
- Okay, Liv,
we talked to Chanel.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.059
They never heard
of Katy Miller.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.460
- She's got texts from
the shyster Phillip Altshuler

14:53.493 --> 14:55.362
telling her not to talk to us.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.197
- Which, unless he was stupid
enough to lie to our face,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.631
are also fake.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.668
- So Katy just takes counsel
from some attorney

15:01.701 --> 15:04.171
she's never heard of who just
randomly pops up on her phone?

15:04.204 --> 15:07.107
- After you've been raped,
how clearly are you thinking?

15:07.140 --> 15:10.010
- See, the texts
from her phone make her

15:10.043 --> 15:11.378
sound like Little Miss Muffet.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.113
- Yeah, on his,
he's the Pillsbury Doughboy.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.547
- But the text on his phone--
I mean,

15:14.581 --> 15:16.649
she's the Marquis de Sade.
- Vice versa.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.385
- Okay, so if they're both
telling the truth,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.521
there's gotta be
a third party involved.

15:21.554 --> 15:22.322
- Catfish?

15:22.355 --> 15:24.557
- Actually it was
a double catfish.

15:24.591 --> 15:28.028
Whoever did it posed as Katy
to message The Monster

15:28.061 --> 15:29.429
and The Monster
to message Katy.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.998
- Now, let's not forget
about Chanel

15:31.031 --> 15:32.499
and this Counselor Altshuler.

15:32.532 --> 15:36.369
- So we'll have Computer Crimes
check the IP address.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.205
- So?
- So the person

15:38.238 --> 15:41.508
at the other end of that IP
address played both of them.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.410
- And you want me to charge
that person with what?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.012
Last I looked,
lying on the Internet

15:45.045 --> 15:46.546
will put you in office.
It won't put you behind bars.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.415
- Ah, well, there's
Criminal Impersonation.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.617
- In the second degree.
You wanna get all worked up

15:50.650 --> 15:52.485
over a misdemeanor?
- No, but I do wanna get

15:52.519 --> 15:54.554
worked up over rape.
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.289
The Monster didn't intend
to rape anyone.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.058
- Yeah, but
the mystery guest did.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.293
- In order for that person
to be charged as an accomplice,

16:00.327 --> 16:02.329
The Monster has to be
found guilty.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.997
I'd hate to be the schmuck
who presents those facts

16:04.031 --> 16:05.198
to a jury.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.699
- What if it never goes
through a jury?

16:06.733 --> 16:08.335
- Why would a guy who gets
punched with bare knuckles

16:08.368 --> 16:10.003
for a living take a plea deal?

16:10.037 --> 16:12.272
- Because we're gonna hit him
with something much harder.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.510
- Rape Three, a non-violent
E felony.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.212
No jail time.
One year probation.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.447
- I don't understand.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.182
Katy's an Instagram star.
She messaged me.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.052
- Because it wasn't from Katy.
It was from a stranger

16:25.085 --> 16:27.720
who made a fake account
supposed to look like Katy.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.456
- Whoever communicated
with Katy did it

16:29.489 --> 16:31.091
from an account made
to look like yours.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.325
- So when we exchanged
phone numbers...

16:32.359 --> 16:34.127
- You weren't texting
with Katy.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.696
That was also the catfisher.
- Why would someone...?

16:36.729 --> 16:38.498
- Okay, time out, time out,
time out.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.467
Is my client under arrest?
- No, he's not.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.135
- So you want him to plead
guilty to raping

16:42.169 --> 16:44.171
this Katy chick even though
there's no way you can

16:44.204 --> 16:45.738
come up with a conviction?

16:45.772 --> 16:47.674
- Look, I know you don't think
that you did anything wrong--

16:47.707 --> 16:50.343
- I didn't.
- Oh, you did.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.754
- Hey.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.158
- Okay.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.460
- They just told me everything.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.129
Katy, I really thought
that you wanted me--

17:09.162 --> 17:12.199
- I told you to stop.
- I didn't think you meant it.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.634
- You choked me, Andy.
- I didn't know.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.070
- You know what else
you didn't know?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.738
I was a virgin.

17:24.244 --> 17:27.714
- My gut tells me that you
didn't mean to hurt Katy.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.483
- I--I didn't.
It was the catfisher, not me.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.386
- The person who did this
deserves jail time.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.256
- The catfisher can't be
an accomplice to rape

17:36.289 --> 17:37.790
unless there is a rape.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.793
- So again, you want Andy
to confess to a crime

17:40.827 --> 17:43.863
that he can't be convicted of.
- Yes.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.400
Otherwise the law says
nothing happened to Katy.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.801
- So here we are.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.305
You can walk out
that door right now

17:52.339 --> 17:54.141
without taking
any responsibility

17:54.174 --> 17:55.375
for what happened.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.676
- And reject
a very generous deal.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.146
- Very generous?
- You're talking about him

17:59.179 --> 18:00.680
forfeiting millions of dollars.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.116
- Or you could risk
doing 20 years.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.651
- That's crap and you know it.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.419
There's no jury in the world
that would find him guilty.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.687
- No, but Katy will.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.422
So if you walk out
this door right now,

18:09.456 --> 18:11.591
you're saying that
nothing happened.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.561
And you'd also know,
for the rest of your life,

18:14.594 --> 18:18.498
that you could've done
something to make it right.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.167
But you chose not to.

18:20.200 --> 18:25.905
- Okay, we're done.
- Shawn.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.107
Katy...

18:30.410 --> 18:32.312
I am so sorry.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.314
- Sorry, no deal,
or sorry I hurt you,

18:34.347 --> 18:35.515
and I'll take the deal?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.250
- I didn't want to hurt you.

18:37.284 --> 18:41.654
- And I don't wanna
hurt you either.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.556
- [sighs]

18:48.828 --> 18:50.630
I'll take the deal.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.468
You can go after
whoever did this now?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.437
- You can count on it.

19:02.942 --> 19:03.276
.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.110
- Computer Crimes tracked
the catfisher

19:05.878 --> 19:07.747
to 3 Whitney Mountain Road,
in Maysville, West Virginia.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.282
- Okay, a name?
- Real estate records

19:09.316 --> 19:10.750
aren't exactly
what you'd call up to date.

19:10.783 --> 19:11.851
- All right, so get
a John Doe warrant.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.420
- Done.
- All right, uh,

19:13.453 --> 19:14.454
forward it
to the local precinct.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.955
- Done.
- Perfect.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.458
Get two first class tickets
to West Virginia.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.427
- Really?
- No.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.796
Fill up your gas tank.
Fin, you're riding shotgun.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.666
- Oh, no, no, I'm allergic
to West Virginia.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.968
- Rollins, you're up.
- You're kidding.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.572
- Look, somebody has gotta
translate for this guy.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.811
- That little man was
out like a light

19:38.845 --> 19:40.513
the second his head
hit the pillow.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.215
- I'm so glad.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.855
- Um, you--you okay?
Did I do something?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.957
- Sheila, Noah asked me
about Ellie.

19:53.426 --> 19:57.264
I specifically told you
that I hadn't told him yet.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.966
- I know, and I just said it
without thinking.

19:59.999 --> 20:03.536
Really, he was asking
so many questions,

20:03.570 --> 20:05.305
and I know Ellie loved him.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.809
- What was your plan if he
asked you what happened to her?

20:09.842 --> 20:14.647
If he asked you
why she gave him up?

20:14.681 --> 20:18.285
If he asked you where he spent
the first year of his life,

20:18.318 --> 20:20.019
what was your plan?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.554
- I wasn't thinking.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.457
I really wasn't,
and I'm very sorry.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.526
- Noah's family is--is--

20:26.559 --> 20:30.330
your family is complicated.

20:30.363 --> 20:34.667
That little boy
is five years old.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.903
When he is old enough,
and when he is ready,

20:36.936 --> 20:39.972
he is going to hear the truth,
but, until then, Sheila,

20:40.006 --> 20:43.410
you have to discuss
these things with me first.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.279
- You are absolutely right.

20:46.313 --> 20:49.382
It will never happen again,
I promise you.

20:49.416 --> 20:54.321
Olivia, this has been,
all of it, wonderful...

20:57.023 --> 20:59.426
I really just
want this to work.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.764
- So do I.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.501
- Can you forgive me?

21:08.535 --> 21:10.670
- Of course.

21:10.703 --> 21:14.507
We're both new at this.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.975
- Thank you.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.051
- Now are you doing
the actual arrest, or am I?

21:25.084 --> 21:27.354
I've never done this
jurisdictional stuff before.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.988
- Technically, you'll have to
make the arrest,

21:29.021 --> 21:30.957
then you'll maintain custody
until the extradition.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.625
Then we'll take over.
- Got it.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.861
- TV's on.
[knocking]

21:34.894 --> 21:36.496
Hey, it's the police.
We just wanna talk.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.997
- Door's open.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.668
- Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm Detective Carisi.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.570
This is Detective Rollins,
NYPD.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.837
- NYPD?

21:44.871 --> 21:46.439
- Yeah, New York Police
Department.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.874
We've got a warrant to search
these premises.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.909
What's your name, ma'am?
- June Parcell.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.478
- Do you have a computer,
Ms. Parcell?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.780
- Computer?
I get the clicker to work,

21:53.813 --> 21:54.914
it's a good day.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.383
- Does anybody else live here?

21:56.416 --> 21:58.017
- My husband used to
till he died,

21:58.050 --> 21:59.786
so my daughter
takes care of me now.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.455
- Is she here now?
- What day is it?

22:02.489 --> 22:05.358
- Monday.
- Heather?

22:05.392 --> 22:06.993
- Mama, what's going on?

22:09.896 --> 22:11.864
- Where do you keep
your computer, Heather?

22:11.898 --> 22:14.534
- You're the police.
- You know why we're here?

22:14.567 --> 22:17.404
- Yeah, because I'm stupid.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.406
It's nice to meet you.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.107
- Where do you keep
your computer?

22:21.140 --> 22:23.443
- Uh, it's under my bed
in my room.

22:24.977 --> 22:28.381
- You take her,
who's gonna change my bag?

22:28.415 --> 22:32.151
- Mama's got cancer.
She can't use the toilet.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.522
- You have somebody for that?
- Yeah.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.989
- We got a winner.

22:37.023 --> 22:41.093
- Heather, I'm placing you
under arrest, okay?

22:41.127 --> 22:44.797
And we're gonna be confiscating
the computer too.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.002
Now, don't hold me to it,
but I think I heard

22:50.036 --> 22:52.639
Heather's voice before.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.774
Blimpie.
- Blimpie?

22:54.807 --> 22:56.443
- Well, that's what
she called herself.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.679
End of the day, the whole thing
turned out to be a scam.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.113
- Can I take the empties?

23:01.147 --> 23:03.082
- No, no, a man needs
to know what he's had.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.684
- He also needs to know
his limit.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.754
- [chuckles]
- Hey, Siri, remind me

23:07.787 --> 23:09.456
to check on Heather's alias,
Blimpie.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.723
- Okay, I'll remind you.

23:10.757 --> 23:13.460
- [groans]
- Hey, Chuck, you okay?

23:13.493 --> 23:16.162
- I'm--I'm gonna use
the little boys.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.901
- I'll take that.

23:21.934 --> 23:26.038
- Changing of the guard.
I got this.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.441
Hey, you must be Buck.
- Last I looked.

23:28.475 --> 23:31.511
- I'm Amanda with
the New York Police Department.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.814
- Wasn't me.
- No, my--my partner and I

23:34.847 --> 23:37.550
are here about one of
your regulars, Heather,

23:37.584 --> 23:39.619
Heather Parcell.
Betsy said you might've gone

23:39.652 --> 23:40.887
to school with her.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.154
- It's always the quiet ones,
right?

23:42.188 --> 23:44.791
- Oh, well, she's not
a serial killer, but...

23:44.824 --> 23:46.859
- But she is kind of
a sad sack.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.528
- But she wasn't ever
any trouble?

23:48.561 --> 23:50.763
- No, her old man would've
locked her in the closet.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.532
I thought she'd be long gone
after he died,

23:52.565 --> 23:55.167
but then her mom got sick.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.669
What'd she do?

23:56.703 --> 23:58.805
- Oh, something stupid.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.073
Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.879
- I've spent way too many
nights in places like these.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.648
- Aw, don't start getting
all teary-eyed

24:08.681 --> 24:09.949
and singing "Dixie" on me.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.851
- I left, didn't I?

24:11.884 --> 24:13.185
No, my favorite place
was Roy's.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.021
I went there every Wednesday
and Thursday night

24:15.054 --> 24:16.255
when Roy was behind the bar.
- Oh, you had a thing

24:16.288 --> 24:19.592
for the owner, huh?
- No, Roy Junior.

24:19.626 --> 24:23.530
And I went home last year
'cause mom had that thing,

24:23.563 --> 24:27.567
and I went back there, and RJ
was still behind the bar,

24:27.600 --> 24:29.001
just like 20 years ago.
- All right, so you had

24:29.035 --> 24:30.269
a couple shots,
you started crying

24:30.302 --> 24:32.104
about that touchdown
he almost made.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.874
- No, I took him out back
and banged his brains out.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.680
[laughter]

24:40.713 --> 24:43.215
I mean, like, like,
six months ago, right,

24:43.249 --> 24:45.552
I get this email
from his sister, Suzie.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.254
- Mm-hmm.
- Been diagnosed with melanoma.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.657
Son of a bitch
just goes off and dies.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.962
You should probably go
check on Chuckie, huh?

25:00.733 --> 25:04.303
Oh, no, we didn't--
- Oh, they're on Buck.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.106
- Okay, thanks.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.879
- I got my coat.
It's--

25:12.912 --> 25:14.280
- Oh!
[glass shattering]

25:14.313 --> 25:16.282
- What the hell?

25:16.315 --> 25:18.017
- I'm sorry.
- Don't tell me!

25:18.050 --> 25:20.019
Tell Missy here.
- Missy, I'm sorry.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.320
Let me get you guys
a round of drinks.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.089
- What the hell'd you say?
- Excuse me?

25:23.122 --> 25:24.256
- You can't just buy me off
with a beer

25:24.290 --> 25:27.126
and say Missy's fine, come on.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.828
[grunts]

25:28.861 --> 25:29.929
- Hey!

25:29.962 --> 25:31.564
[grunting]

25:31.598 --> 25:33.132
Come on, let him go!

25:33.165 --> 25:35.034
- You gotta admit that was fun.
- Oh, so much fun!

25:35.067 --> 25:36.903
- That was fun.
- I haven't had that much fun

25:36.936 --> 25:39.739
since Christmas 2005.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.173
Oh, this is where I get off.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.943
[laughs]
- You know...

25:43.976 --> 25:45.878
There's something nice
about not having to

25:45.912 --> 25:47.313
always act like a cop.

25:47.346 --> 25:49.248
- Yeah.
- You know, we could've taken

25:49.281 --> 25:52.619
all those guys, you know?
- Oh, I know we could.

25:52.652 --> 25:55.287
- You know what?
You're a helluva partner.

25:55.321 --> 25:59.158
- You too.
- Nah, you've got my back,

25:59.191 --> 26:02.695
and I can't tell you
how much I appreciate that.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.333
Not just tonight.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.975
- I'm beat.
- Yeah, I should, um...

26:16.008 --> 26:18.745
- Okay.
- All right, good night.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.613
- Okay, night.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.282
[keys clinking]

26:24.751 --> 26:27.253
- Hey, Liv, tell Rafael not
to worry about extradition.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.688
Heather waived the hearing.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.322
Because she wants to come
to New York.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.924
Yeah, we're picking her up now.

26:31.958 --> 26:32.925
She'll be out in about 15.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.827
Okay, got it.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.696
[indistinct chatter]
- Well, I'll get out of here.

26:36.729 --> 26:37.697
- All right.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.931
All right, that was fun.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.232
- Maybe see you next time.
- Okay.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.801
- Have a good one.
- Bye.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.369
- Bye.

26:50.142 --> 26:50.309
.

26:50.342 --> 26:50.977
- Me and Cheryl,
my best friend,

26:52.311 --> 26:54.113
we used to dream about going
to New York City

26:54.146 --> 26:55.782
like Mary Tyler Moore
did on TV.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.217
We would throw our hats
in the air and everything.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.052
- Did Cheryl ever make it?

27:00.086 --> 27:01.921
- Well, she went
to Clarksville, Tennessee.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.790
I know it's not the same
as New York City,

27:03.823 --> 27:05.291
but I'm still kind of jealous.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.793
- You could've gone with her.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.795
- She went with Gary,
her husband.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.262
He sells machine parts.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.999
Besides, someone's gotta
take care of Mama.

27:15.134 --> 27:19.338
- I had a sister three years
younger than me.

27:19.371 --> 27:23.075
She could not stand
the cold weather.

27:23.109 --> 27:26.145
She moved to Scottsdale
about eight years ago.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.080
- Oh, were you close?

27:29.782 --> 27:32.218
- We were sisters.

27:32.251 --> 27:36.122
She passed away
three years ago.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.057
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.092
- Breast cancer.

27:41.994 --> 27:45.965
You know, you, me,
and Noah, all of this--

27:45.998 --> 27:49.668
it's good, isn't it?

27:51.771 --> 27:54.273
- Yes, it is.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.210
- You know what
I would love to do?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.980
Would it be okay
if I bought Noah

28:01.013 --> 28:03.415
a nice, warm winter jacket?

28:03.449 --> 28:06.786
Would that be okay?

28:06.819 --> 28:11.057
- I think that he would
absolutely love that.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.965
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.032
- 'Cause I can drive.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.901
- Nah, I slept like a baby.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.970
How'd you sleep?
'Cause sometimes,

28:24.003 --> 28:28.040
after drinking, I just--I stare
at the ceiling, you know?

28:30.977 --> 28:33.746
- You wanna talk
about something?

28:33.780 --> 28:35.347
- No.

28:35.381 --> 28:38.417
- Am I gonna be able
to meet him?

28:38.450 --> 28:41.287
- Who?
- The Monster.

28:41.320 --> 28:45.324
- Oh, you'll meet him,
for sure.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.993
- We're willing to go down
to Rape Two.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.995
Seven years in prison.
- But less if I behave good?

28:49.028 --> 28:51.330
- That's right, Heather,
and if you don't take the deal,

28:51.363 --> 28:54.033
you're looking at accessory
to Rape One.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.168
That's rape by
forcible compulsion.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.905
That's a violent B felony,
up to 25 years.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.372
- Well, I don't wanna
sound stupid,

29:00.406 --> 29:04.343
but how could I rape a girl?

29:04.376 --> 29:07.013
- It's like The Monster
robbed a bank,

29:07.046 --> 29:08.781
and you drove the getaway car.

29:08.815 --> 29:11.884
- Not quite, but I'll explain
it to you later, Heather.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.052
- Sorry, I'm late.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.286
There's been a mix-up.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.521
I'll need a moment
with my client.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.556
- Who are you?
- Phillip Altshuler,

29:17.589 --> 29:19.926
Attorney at Law.
- Excuse me, you said that

29:19.959 --> 29:21.260
you didn't even know her.

29:21.293 --> 29:24.196
- Oh, we haven't
formally met, no.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.032
- How are you?
- Your client has already

29:26.065 --> 29:27.366
obtained a public defender.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.268
- And therein lies the mix-up.

29:29.301 --> 29:32.071
Heather didn't exactly know
I was coming.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.105
- How did you find me?

29:33.139 --> 29:34.373
- You're all over the news.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.142
Nice to finally meet you.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.544
- He's the lawyer that Heather
impersonated to coerce Katy

29:38.577 --> 29:40.412
to keep quiet.
- Yeah, that I guessed.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.882
You gotta admit, Counselor,
this is a little bit odd.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.450
If you weren't representing
her, you'd be begging me

29:44.483 --> 29:46.318
to charge her
with Criminal Impersonation.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.021
- I see no conflict of interest
as long as Ms. Parcell

29:49.055 --> 29:50.222
is okay with it.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.290
- I can't pay you.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.092
- This one's on me.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.861
You already know I'm good.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.495
- Excuse me, how would
she know that?

29:56.528 --> 29:58.831
- Well, he was on the Internet
under the best lawyers

29:58.865 --> 29:59.999
in New York.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.201
I'm honored.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.569
- Bye-bye.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.205
My client respectfully rejects
whatever plea deal

30:06.238 --> 30:09.541
is on the table.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.912
- Hey, so I'm gonna get
a sandwich if you wanna--

30:12.945 --> 30:14.480
- No, I'm good.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.516
- Is that about Heather?

30:17.549 --> 30:21.253
- Uh, yeah, I'm scanning
her digital footprint.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.955
- Anything useful?
- Well, she lived her life

30:22.989 --> 30:26.325
on her computer, so there's
a lot to go through.

30:32.098 --> 30:36.102
- You sure you don't wanna
get a sandwich with me?

30:36.135 --> 30:37.436
- I'm sure.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.143
- You know I'm human, right?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.512
Right, and human people
have sex,

30:46.545 --> 30:48.247
sometimes with people
they love,

30:48.280 --> 30:51.050
sometimes with people
they don't even know.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.953
- Mm, thanks for that.

30:53.986 --> 30:57.423
- And sometimes with people
who are pains in the ass.

31:08.067 --> 31:11.037
- Once we moved
from Instagram to texting,

31:11.070 --> 31:12.905
we talked about everything.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.374
I told him I wanted
to take it slow,

31:15.407 --> 31:17.910
and eventually
we agreed to meet up.

31:17.944 --> 31:22.281
He looked scary,
but in real life, he was sweet.

31:22.314 --> 31:25.317
At first, it was a good date.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.385
- Then what happened?

31:26.418 --> 31:28.187
- All of a sudden, he changed.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.422
He grabbed me by the throat.

31:30.456 --> 31:34.360
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't move.

31:34.393 --> 31:38.330
Then he ripped my clothes off,
and he raped me.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.532
- Objection.
- Sustained.

31:40.566 --> 31:44.403
- Be a little more specific,
Katy, if you can.

31:44.436 --> 31:48.207
- Put his mouth on me.
His tongue.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.176
I tried to close my legs,

31:50.209 --> 31:55.314
and then he jammed his...in me.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.616
- Did you tell him to stop?

31:57.649 --> 32:00.452
- Over and over.
- How'd he respond?

32:00.486 --> 32:02.354
- He said he knew this is
what I wanted.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.190
- Where did that idea
come from?

32:04.223 --> 32:06.092
- I thought it came from Katy.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.593
We'd been texting for weeks.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.495
She said she had
a rape fantasy.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.431
- Did that sound odd to you?
- Well, yeah.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.700
- So what'd you do?
- I asked her if she was sure,

32:14.733 --> 32:17.036
multiple times,
but she was clear.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.371
She wanted me to force her
no matter what.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.440
- But that wasn't really
Katy's fantasy, was it?

32:21.473 --> 32:24.010
- Objection, the witness
isn't a mind-reader.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.711
- Sustained.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.479
- What, if anything,
did you come to learn

32:27.513 --> 32:29.548
about those texts asking you
to rape Katy?

32:29.581 --> 32:31.717
- She didn't really send them.
- Who did?

32:31.750 --> 32:35.054
- We traced the texts to
an IP address in West Virginia

32:35.087 --> 32:38.124
to a computer belonging to
Heather Parcell, the defendant.

32:38.157 --> 32:43.029
She had sent over 1,000 text
messages to Katy posing

32:43.062 --> 32:47.466
as The Monster, Andy McPherson,
and over 600 messages to Andy

32:47.499 --> 32:49.535
posing as Katy,
and this was all during

32:49.568 --> 32:51.103
a six week period.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.405
- Is it possible
she was hacked and someone else

32:53.439 --> 32:55.074
sent those messages?

32:55.107 --> 32:57.609
- No, she confessed to
catfishing both Andy and Katy

32:57.643 --> 32:59.545
before we arrested her.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.683
- When Heather confessed
so quickly,

33:04.716 --> 33:07.219
did you get the idea
that she realized the gravity

33:07.253 --> 33:08.520
of what she'd done?

33:08.554 --> 33:10.022
- I can't speak
to her state of mind.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.524
- Did Heather Parcell
ever express her opinion

33:12.558 --> 33:13.792
of The Monster to you?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.795
- She said she was excited
to meet him.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.231
- Would you say
she idolized him?

33:19.265 --> 33:21.200
- I'd say she wanted
to meet him.

33:21.233 --> 33:24.170
- Like she was a fan.
- Yes.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.306
- Like someone who wanted to
see him go to prison for rape?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.241
- Objection.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.709
- It was fun, like a game.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.811
I never thought that
it'd actually happen.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.580
- And where in the world
did you get the idea

33:34.613 --> 33:37.716
that a woman would actually
ask to be raped?

33:37.749 --> 33:40.752
- It's stupid.
- Tell us anyway.

33:40.786 --> 33:44.123
- I saw it on
one of Mama's soaps.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.557
She watches 'em every day.

33:45.591 --> 33:49.428
- So you never actually had
a rape fantasy yourself?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.829
- Me?
No.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.599
- Did anyone you know in
Maysville have such a fantasy?

33:53.632 --> 33:56.102
- I don't know.
- You never talked to anyone

33:56.135 --> 33:58.104
about it?
- I--I don't talk

33:58.137 --> 34:00.606
to many people.
- And why is that?

34:00.639 --> 34:04.543
- Mama.
She's real sick, cancer.

34:04.576 --> 34:08.347
It's bad.
Diabetes, rheumatoid.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.648
That's why she's not here.

34:09.681 --> 34:12.318
She can't walk,
and I take care of her.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.354
- Mm-hmm, uh, how so?

34:15.387 --> 34:18.757
- Uh, I make breakfast, lunch,
and dinner every day.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.727
When she's too weak,
I spoon feed her.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.264
After that,
I change her poop bag,

34:25.297 --> 34:29.735
and I give her a sponge bath
because she can't take showers,

34:29.768 --> 34:34.373
and then I press her fingertips
and rub her feet

34:34.406 --> 34:37.676
'cause they hurt,
and that sometimes helps.

34:37.709 --> 34:41.247
And on the bad days, I hold
the bucket while she pukes.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.650
- And when you're not taking
care of her, what do you do?

34:44.683 --> 34:46.585
- Talk to people
on the computer.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.654
- People like Katy
and The Monster.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.656
- I love it
when they talk back.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.724
- Did you ever intend
to harm Katy?

34:52.758 --> 34:54.760
- No.
- Did you wanna see The Monster

34:54.793 --> 34:59.498
go to prison?
- No, never.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.667
- Nothing further.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.602
- It's getting late, Mr. Barba.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.605
You can cross-examine
the witness tomorrow.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.749
- Shouldn't you be
on mother duty?

35:17.783 --> 35:20.386
- Grandma took Noah
to the movies,

35:20.419 --> 35:21.920
and now they're getting pizza.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.555
- He's a lucky kid.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.191
- He is indeed.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.859
- He ended up in the right
zip code with the right people.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.231
- Heather Parcell?

35:32.264 --> 35:34.333
- The Internet has made
the world a smaller place,

35:34.366 --> 35:36.468
but some people still
get lost in it.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.937
- She instigated
a rape, Rafael.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.906
- Out of boredom.
She had no motive.

35:40.939 --> 35:43.642
- How is stupidity a defense?
- It's not, but this is just

35:43.675 --> 35:45.311
a bad case.
The girl doesn't have

35:45.344 --> 35:47.546
a malicious bone in her body.
- Oh, my God.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.482
- No motive means no story
for the jury.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.484
This was the most exciting
thing in her life.

35:52.518 --> 35:55.787
- And the most painful
for Katy.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.556
- If I was on that jury,
I'd vote to acquit

35:57.589 --> 36:00.192
out of pity alone.

36:00.226 --> 36:01.493
Hey, what's going on?

36:01.527 --> 36:03.462
- Well, right after
The Monster and Katy

36:03.495 --> 36:04.963
agreed to meet up,
Heather texted 'em

36:04.996 --> 36:07.733
both a picture asking
if a friend could tag along.

36:07.766 --> 36:11.670
They said no, but does
that friend look familiar?

36:11.703 --> 36:13.705
- Well, this establishes
a possible revenge motive,

36:13.739 --> 36:15.474
but not mens rea.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.544
- Yeah, but if you toss
these in the pot as well...

36:22.814 --> 36:26.218
- The human body has
a lot of bones.

36:32.258 --> 36:32.424
.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.592
- It looks like you wanted
to be friends with The Monster.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.528
- He's famous.
Who wouldn't?

36:36.562 --> 36:37.863
- Could you read
this text please?

36:37.896 --> 36:39.665
- "My girlfriend would like
to come with us."

36:39.698 --> 36:40.932
- You sent this to him.
- Yes.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.635
- Pretending to be Katy?
- Yes.

36:43.669 --> 36:46.472
- And this photo was attached
to the text,

36:46.505 --> 36:47.873
just like the one you sent
to Katy pretending

36:47.906 --> 36:50.809
to be The Monster?
- Yes.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.579
- How did he respond?
- He said no, that he just

36:53.612 --> 36:56.382
wanted alone time with Katy.
- And Katy, what did she say?

36:56.415 --> 36:58.450
- She said no, she wanted
to be alone with Andy.

36:58.484 --> 36:59.918
- And neither of them wanted
to be with you.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.887
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.555
- What would you have done
if one of them said yes?

37:03.589 --> 37:06.492
- Objection.
- Sustained.

37:06.525 --> 37:13.299
- So you are your mother's
primary caretaker,

37:13.332 --> 37:14.266
is that right?

37:14.300 --> 37:15.834
- Well, there's no one else.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.437
- You feed her, you bathe her,
you wash her hair?

37:18.470 --> 37:20.038
- Relevance?
- It'll become clear.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.707
- Proceed.
- Do you wash

37:21.740 --> 37:23.842
your mother's hair,
Ms. Parcell?

37:23.875 --> 37:25.844
- Yes.
- What shampoo do you use?

37:25.877 --> 37:27.679
- Oh, come on.
- It will help to establish

37:27.713 --> 37:29.615
intent, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

37:29.648 --> 37:33.452
- I use Blue Glacier shampoo.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.954
- Who's Blimpie-89,
Ms. Parcell?

37:37.623 --> 37:41.360
- It's me on Reddit.
A name that I sometimes use.

37:41.393 --> 37:47.599
- I'd like to introduce into
evidence exhibit 24B.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.868
Please read this Reddit post.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.938
- "Who the hell likes
Blue Glacier shampoo,

37:52.971 --> 37:57.743
"and why would they use
a disgusting bitch

37:57.776 --> 38:01.046
like Katy Miller to sell
their crap?"

38:01.079 --> 38:04.750
- You posted that on Reddit
at 9:48 p.m.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.585
on November 6th, is that right?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.720
- I guess.
- How many Instagram followers

38:08.754 --> 38:10.288
do you have?

38:12.458 --> 38:14.360
- I don't know.

38:14.393 --> 38:18.330
- Ms. Miller has over 200,000.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.533
The Monster has 5 million.

38:21.567 --> 38:24.370
How many Instagram followers
do you have?

38:24.403 --> 38:28.540
- I don't know.
- You have six.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.676
Sound about right?

38:30.709 --> 38:33.311
- I guess.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.849
- It isn't fair.

38:37.883 --> 38:41.387
He beats people up
for a living.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.755
She posts sexy photos
of herself holding shampoo.

38:43.789 --> 38:47.926
They're both famous.
They both have lots of friends.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.463
You resent them both,
don't you, Heather?

38:51.497 --> 38:53.965
You work so hard
to take care of your mom,

38:53.999 --> 38:57.102
and nobody cares.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.906
Nobody gives a damn what you
have to say about anything.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.941
- I never meant to hurt Andy.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.777
- What about Katy?

39:05.811 --> 39:07.045
- She's from Pensacola.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.580
It's not much bigger
than Maysville.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.115
- She posts near-naked photos
of herself,

39:10.148 --> 39:12.083
and they make her rich.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.887
- And I have to rub
Mama's feet.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.556
- And you wanted to get even.

39:17.589 --> 39:20.426
- It's not fair!

39:20.459 --> 39:23.429
She gets paid to take a shower,
and I have to change

39:23.462 --> 39:24.129
Mama's poop bag?

39:24.162 --> 39:26.498
She deserves what she got!

39:32.003 --> 39:33.872
It's not fair.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.380
I'm sorry.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.757
- Has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

39:51.790 --> 39:53.725
- We have, Your Honor.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.727
In the matter of
the People of New York versus

39:55.761 --> 39:59.130
Heather Parcell on the charge
of Rape in the First Degree,

39:59.164 --> 40:01.633
we find the defendant guilty.

40:15.914 --> 40:21.587
- All right, now this is
a big boy coat.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.656
Well, why don't you take a look
at yourself in the mirror?

40:30.195 --> 40:32.030
- Is the hood too big?

40:32.063 --> 40:36.802
- Huh, hmm, do you think it is?

40:36.835 --> 40:40.906
Okay, well, let's try...

40:40.939 --> 40:46.678
Oh, you are going to love
this one.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.983

Noah?

Noah?

[gasping]

41:04.830 --> 41:06.031
- The Monster is caged.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.533
Well, that's the end
of his career.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.934
Nobody's gonna touch him again.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.068
- How's he ever gonna
make it with a mere

41:10.101 --> 41:11.603
50 million in the bank?

41:11.637 --> 41:12.938
- Imagine walking around,
everybody thinking

41:12.971 --> 41:14.105
you're a rapist.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.741
- Or you can just move
to Hollywood.
