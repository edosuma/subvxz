-Oh, you son of a bitch!

08:57.605 --> 08:59.239
Don't you be spitting
on Duvall property!

08:59.272 --> 09:03.243
Only Duvall property I see
is your ugly-ass face!

09:03.276 --> 09:05.445
I'm about to smack it in
with a damn stick of rebar!

09:05.478 --> 09:08.916
You showed up with rebar
to a gun fight.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.083
So did I.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.419
Guess that makes this
a rebar fight.

09:12.452 --> 09:16.456
Dewey Duvall Jr.,
I challenge you to a duel

09:16.489 --> 09:19.359
for all the land on the other
side of this wind-blown...

09:19.392 --> 09:20.894
Where's
the tater-chip baggie?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.763
Probably blew away.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.599
It always was
very wind-blown.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.068
Oh, I'll whup your ass,
but I ain't giving you my land.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.704
I done told you,
it's my damn land!

09:30.738 --> 09:32.139
Ow. It's my land!

09:32.172 --> 09:34.608
-Ow! It's my land!
-Ow. I told you it's my land.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.443
[ Siren wails ] Ow.
Damn it, it's my land!

09:36.476 --> 09:40.914
Ow. Duvall -- Early, Dewey
Jr., y'all drop that rebar!

09:40.948 --> 09:43.316
-Sheriff, stay out of this.
-Ow!

09:43.350 --> 09:45.252
Y'all, there's no need
for violence.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.120
Rusty and I
hired a survey crew

09:47.154 --> 09:49.623
so we can settle
this whole thing peacefully.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.091
Yeah, and after they mark
the property line,

09:51.124 --> 09:52.292
we can put up a fence.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.228
And good fences
make good neighbors.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.665
Can we still beach each other
to death with rebar?

09:57.698 --> 10:00.968
Well [clears throat] it's not
against any law I'm aware of.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.069
-Ow!
-Ow!

10:02.102 --> 10:03.971
-Ow, ow, ow!
-Ow!

10:04.004 --> 10:05.272
-Ow!
-Ow!

10:05.305 --> 10:06.774
-Ow!
-Ow!

10:06.807 --> 10:07.808
-Ow!
-Ow!

10:07.841 --> 10:08.942
-Ow!
-Ow!

10:08.976 --> 10:10.443
-Ow!
-Hey, uh, you guys mind

10:10.477 --> 10:12.479
taking a couple steps
over to the left?

10:12.512 --> 10:14.514
Ow. Sure, I'll whup
his ass over here.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.583
Hell, every bit of this
is Cuyler land.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.654
Uh, well, these county maps show
this is Duvall land.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.522
-What?! That's impossible!
-Ow!

10:22.555 --> 10:25.158
And the Cuyler property,
well, that's everything

10:25.192 --> 10:27.460
inside
these four stakes here.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.529
Just about big enough
to hold your shack,

10:29.562 --> 10:31.799
which appears
to have shifted east.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.334
I-I moved
to a little closer into town,

10:34.367 --> 10:35.836
you know,
shorten my commute.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.805
Well, you best get your shack
back on your land,

10:37.838 --> 10:40.841
'cause right now,
it's trespassing on Duvall land.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.175
How about you make me,
big'un?

10:42.209 --> 10:44.144
Dewey Double-J,
set fire to the shack.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.478
No, no, no, no!

10:45.512 --> 10:48.215
Now get that flaming shit shack
off my land.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.150
Come on, y'all.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.519
Let's get this
flaming shit shack off his land.

10:52.552 --> 10:56.356
Can I challenge you
to a rebar fight?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.325
Maybe win back
some of my land?

10:58.358 --> 10:59.559
I don't think so.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.229
Maybe my mama could have
the sex with you

11:02.262 --> 11:03.731
and maybe you'd give us
some land?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.198
Daddy, that ain't got nothing
to do with it.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.034
Well,
I'm just spit-balling here.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.903
Would you maybe be interested
in selling me some land?

11:09.937 --> 11:12.039
Sorry, we're not on the market
at the moment.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.174
God damn it!
