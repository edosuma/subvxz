WEBVTT

00:00.929 --> 00:02.984
They say being
a stay-at-home mom

00:02.985 --> 00:04.457
is the noblest
and hardest profession

00:04.458 --> 00:05.858
a woman could have,

00:05.859 --> 00:07.093
but they're all lying.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.527
It's the greatest scam on earth.

00:08.528 --> 00:09.895
I never have to put on pants...

00:09.896 --> 00:12.031
My boobs magically
make baby food,

00:12.032 --> 00:14.333
and I get to spend all day
with my best buddy Leo.

00:14.334 --> 00:17.570
Hey, Leo.
Can you pass the chips, please?

00:17.571 --> 00:18.872
Oh.

00:21.174 --> 00:23.843
Hey, babe.

00:23.844 --> 00:24.910
What the hell happened here?

00:24.911 --> 00:26.779
Where's... where's dinner?

00:26.780 --> 00:28.848
I was in surgery for six hours.

00:28.849 --> 00:30.282
You didn't make any dinner?

00:30.283 --> 00:32.084
How could I have done that?
We just woke up.

00:32.085 --> 00:33.285
What'd you do all day?

00:33.286 --> 00:34.887
I think I taught Leo
how to use a cell phone,

00:34.888 --> 00:37.289
and we made this. Ta-da!

00:37.290 --> 00:38.758
Baby's first enemies list.

00:38.759 --> 00:40.860
There's Princess Charlotte,
Silas Timberlake,

00:40.861 --> 00:41.894
that noisy garbage truck

00:41.895 --> 00:43.262
that wakes him up every morning.

00:43.263 --> 00:44.296
Did you think about, maybe,

00:44.297 --> 00:45.898
tidying up the apartment
a little bit?

00:45.899 --> 00:47.099
Oh, that reminds me.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.334
The housekeeper
didn't show up today.

00:48.335 --> 00:49.769
I hope Sylvia's okay.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.804
Plus, I have a garbage bag
full of old Spanx for her.

00:51.805 --> 00:53.005
Oh, I let Sylvia go.

00:53.006 --> 00:54.540
I thought cleaning
would be your job now.

00:54.541 --> 00:56.008
Danny, I can't clean!

00:56.009 --> 00:57.843
I was born in this
country and I'm too lazy.

00:57.844 --> 00:59.044
Min...

00:59.045 --> 01:01.280
Look, if we're gonna be
a single-income family,

01:01.281 --> 01:03.249
we can't afford to eat
takeout every night

01:03.250 --> 01:05.785
and have a housekeeper
wait on us hand and foot.

01:05.786 --> 01:07.353
Ma did it with no help,
and she had to work

01:07.354 --> 01:08.554
cleaning hotel rooms.

01:08.555 --> 01:10.523
That's a good point.
I can do this.

01:10.524 --> 01:11.724
That's the spirit.

01:11.725 --> 01:12.892
You're gonna be
a great stay-at-home mom,

01:12.893 --> 01:13.993
I know it.

01:13.994 --> 01:15.728
Stay-at-home mom.

01:15.729 --> 01:18.130
Can you remind me
what that job entails?

01:18.131 --> 01:20.432
Cooking, cleaning,
laundry, paying the bills,

01:20.433 --> 01:22.334
waxing the floors,
keeping the piano in tune,

01:22.335 --> 01:24.003
stocking the pantry,
raising our son,

01:24.004 --> 01:25.738
and maintaining
a positive attitude

01:25.739 --> 01:28.040
that sets the tone for
the rest of the household.

01:28.041 --> 01:30.142
Oh... huh.

01:32.490 --> 01:34.880

01:38.118 --> 01:39.752
Wow, you're up early.

01:39.753 --> 01:42.087
Is Miss Piggy co-hosting
"The Today Show?"

01:42.088 --> 01:43.722
No, she karate-chopped
Savannah Guthrie

01:43.723 --> 01:45.958
and got banned from set.

01:45.959 --> 01:48.694
Danny, getting up early
is an essential part

01:48.695 --> 01:50.629
of being a stay-at-home MILF.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.498
MILF.

01:52.499 --> 01:54.533
A Mom I'd Like To French?

01:54.534 --> 01:55.601
I like that.

01:55.602 --> 01:57.303
This is my new job.

01:57.304 --> 01:59.438
So, I just need
to take the focus

01:59.439 --> 02:01.574
that I had in
my old job as a doctor,

02:01.575 --> 02:03.676
and simply apply it to this.

02:03.677 --> 02:06.645
For instance, my fiance's
morning cup of coffee.

02:06.646 --> 02:07.880
Wow.

02:07.881 --> 02:09.148
And I found this
really cool mommy blog

02:09.149 --> 02:11.083
"Modern Mominista,

02:11.084 --> 02:13.686
living a fabulous life one
dirty diaper at a time."

02:13.687 --> 02:14.954
You can tell it's
a really classy site

02:14.955 --> 02:17.122
because the banner ads
are for anti-depressants.

02:17.123 --> 02:19.892
We... got a little
something in there.

02:19.893 --> 02:21.493
Oh, no, you leave that in there.

02:21.494 --> 02:23.429
That's the coffee.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.597
You leave it in here?

02:24.598 --> 02:26.732
Do you not like it?

02:26.733 --> 02:27.800
I love it.

02:31.838 --> 02:34.173
Good morning, Shulman &amp;
Associates,

02:34.174 --> 02:36.575
and welcome to
your new intercom.

02:36.576 --> 02:38.844
I noticed that our morning
meetings were becoming

02:38.845 --> 02:40.813
interminable, because
I couldn't seem to get through

02:40.814 --> 02:42.281
a single sentence
without interruptions.

02:42.282 --> 02:43.315
- Dr. Reed, I need the day off.
- Dr. Reed,

02:43.316 --> 02:44.650
this chair hurts my butt cheeks.

02:44.651 --> 02:47.219
However, with this new
office-wide intercom,

02:47.220 --> 02:48.787
I never need to be worried about

02:48.788 --> 02:50.689
being interrupted ever agai...

02:50.690 --> 02:51.924
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:51.925 --> 02:53.325
I have a query, and I warn you,

02:53.326 --> 02:54.793
it pertains to
matters of the heart.

02:54.794 --> 02:56.428
Oh, you have a crush on me.

02:56.429 --> 02:58.631
You're too old, I'm sorry!

02:58.632 --> 03:00.165
Ah, don't tempt me, Beverly.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.167
I have a hot air balloon
ride with your name on it.

03:02.168 --> 03:03.636
In that case, pick me up at six.

03:03.637 --> 03:04.670
I live in the alley.

03:04.671 --> 03:06.238
No.

03:06.239 --> 03:08.674
This is about my sweet darlin'
little baby sister, Colette.

03:08.675 --> 03:11.477
I need to find her a man.

03:11.478 --> 03:12.544
A man?

03:12.545 --> 03:15.014
For what?
To spot her at the gym?

03:15.015 --> 03:16.015
I could do that.

03:16.016 --> 03:17.216
No, a male suitor.

03:17.217 --> 03:18.651
Our grandfather's
wedding is coming up,

03:18.652 --> 03:20.052
and I don't want her to
be the only woman there

03:20.053 --> 03:21.787
without a dance partner,

03:21.788 --> 03:23.889
especially since
she is so graceful.

03:24.891 --> 03:28.127
Damn it, open up you dick!

03:28.128 --> 03:29.395
So, if y'all think of anyone

03:29.396 --> 03:31.497
who might fit the bill,
I'd be greatly obliged.

03:31.498 --> 03:33.666
Oh, and for your information,

03:33.667 --> 03:35.669
Jewish is fine.

03:37.103 --> 03:38.437
Hmm.

03:38.438 --> 03:40.205
Colette's gay, right?

03:40.206 --> 03:41.707
'Cause if not, I'm taking
back the walking stick

03:41.708 --> 03:42.908
I got her for her birthday.

03:42.909 --> 03:44.710
No, definitely,
I know gay when I see it, okay?

03:44.711 --> 03:46.245
I was in prison

03:46.246 --> 03:48.314
with Carson Kressley,
who's a great guy,

03:48.315 --> 03:49.581
and totally changed
my sense of fashion.

03:49.582 --> 03:50.683
- Look at that.
- Okay, guys.

03:50.684 --> 03:52.685
Let's stop gossiping about this.

03:52.686 --> 03:53.819
If Colette wants to come out,

03:53.820 --> 03:55.921
let's let her do
it in her own way.

03:55.922 --> 03:57.656
Richie came out during
his tumbling routine

03:57.657 --> 03:59.892
at the high school talent show.

03:59.893 --> 04:01.794
Brought down the house.

04:01.795 --> 04:05.097
And that is our new
40-digit Wi-Fi password.

04:05.098 --> 04:08.000
For security reasons,
I will never repeat it again.

04:08.001 --> 04:10.402
- Come on, man!
- Dang, man!

04:10.403 --> 04:11.870
Leo, you better hold
on to your pacifier,

04:11.871 --> 04:13.706
because your mom is
about to transform

04:25.185 --> 04:27.186
Take advantage
of the baby's nap

04:27.187 --> 04:28.721
to clean the house.

04:28.722 --> 04:30.622
But don't use the vacuum.
That'll wake him up.

04:30.623 --> 04:32.558
Hand clean the floor with
all-organic products.

04:32.559 --> 04:34.493
Hand clean?

04:34.494 --> 04:35.527
I've never gotten on my knees

04:35.528 --> 04:37.329
and not gotten
jewelry out of it.

By now, you should be back

04:57.851 --> 04:59.418
from your five-mile run,
and your duck

04:59.419 --> 05:01.020
should be ready to
come out of the oven.

Hey, Morgan,
I need to talk to you.

05:25.979 --> 05:28.947
Uh, you know I'm gay, right?

05:28.948 --> 05:31.116
Yeah, I had a pretty good idea.

05:31.117 --> 05:32.418
I mean,
your Pinterest is all pictures

05:32.419 --> 05:33.852
of steaks you wanna cook.

05:33.853 --> 05:35.154
I made it my homepage.

05:35.155 --> 05:36.422
My brother doesn't
know that I'm gay,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.457
and I'm not gonna
tell him because

05:38.458 --> 05:40.125
the dude is old-fashioned.

05:40.126 --> 05:42.194
I'm talking, he's got
a bullet in his shoulder

05:42.195 --> 05:43.429
from a duel.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.164
So you never tried to tell him?

05:45.165 --> 05:46.432
It's easier this way.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.766
Just pretend like
it doesn't exist.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.601
But the problem now
is that he's trying

05:49.602 --> 05:51.103
to find me a wedding date.

05:51.104 --> 05:55.104
So... I wanted to see if you
would play my boyfriend.

05:55.975 --> 05:59.445
Just till this blows over,
and then that's it.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.479
Are you asking me out?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.381
Yes, but as pretend,
so don't get...

06:04.684 --> 06:06.351
- This is my first ask-out.
- Really?

06:06.352 --> 06:08.253
Congratulations,
because you got yourself

06:08.254 --> 06:09.488

All right, yes!

06:11.891 --> 06:13.592
No!

06:30.844 --> 06:33.479
Baby's asleep,
the house has been

06:33.480 --> 06:36.014
spotlessly cleaned with
useless organic products,

06:36.015 --> 06:37.950
and for dinner,

06:37.951 --> 06:41.954
Grilled cheese and tomato soup.

Queso panini
and my take on hot gazpacho.

Grilled cheese and tomato soup.

Oh, thanks, but you know what?

07:53.226 --> 07:55.027
I, uh, I picked up something

on the way home,

No, it's just that

08:01.100 --> 08:03.402
you mastered grilled cheese.

08:03.403 --> 08:05.604
Maybe it's time to, you know,

08:05.605 --> 08:07.172
try cooking something else?

08:07.173 --> 08:10.175
Sure, yeah,
I'll just take cooking classes

08:10.176 --> 08:13.011
at the Manhattan Institute
for Women with Infinite Time!

08:13.012 --> 08:15.647
Okay, just... just
forget I said that.

08:15.648 --> 08:17.249
Uh, why don't you cool off,

08:17.250 --> 08:19.651
and while you do that,
I'll hit the gym.

08:19.652 --> 08:20.953
You know what?

08:20.954 --> 08:22.387
Why don't you stay here
and look after Leo,

08:22.388 --> 08:23.455
and I go out for a while?

08:23.456 --> 08:24.590
I haven't been outside

08:24.591 --> 08:25.591
since I took
our trash to the river.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.259
I just... I was hoping to

08:27.260 --> 08:29.194
take a break, I mean...

08:29.195 --> 08:30.362
I worked all day.

08:30.363 --> 08:31.863
Yeah, I also worked all day,

08:31.864 --> 08:32.898
and I would also love a break.

08:32.899 --> 08:35.000
But your job's fun.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.268
I'm jealous,
you get to hang out all day

08:36.269 --> 08:38.403
with the coolest
little guy around.

08:38.404 --> 08:40.339
- Hang out all day?
- Yeah.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.741
You think this is a vacation?

08:42.741 --> 08:46.245
You think I'm laying on the
beach tits-deep in a margarita?

08:46.246 --> 08:47.312
If you think this is so easy,
Danny,

08:47.313 --> 08:48.413
then why don't you try it?

08:48.414 --> 08:49.414
You would die.

08:49.415 --> 08:50.782
I don't think so.

08:50.783 --> 08:52.084
I think I'd be
pretty good at it.

08:52.085 --> 08:53.418
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

08:53.419 --> 08:54.853
Well then, you got a deal, bud.

08:54.854 --> 08:56.221
On Monday, I'm gonna go to work,

08:56.222 --> 08:57.256
and you can stay at home.

08:57.257 --> 08:58.724
Great, sounds like a lot of fun.

08:58.725 --> 09:00.459
You can call me
"Stay-at-home Dan."

09:00.460 --> 09:02.661
I will,
because it sounds pretty stupid.

09:02.662 --> 09:03.695
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:03.696 --> 09:04.930
I'm going to go to the gym

09:04.931 --> 09:07.032
while you take care of our son.

09:07.033 --> 09:08.834
Good.

09:08.835 --> 09:10.275
Damn it,
now I have to go to the gym.

09:15.508 --> 09:18.043
Okay, stay-at-home daddy,
I am off to work.

09:18.044 --> 09:20.145
So, where's my break...

09:20.146 --> 09:22.581
fast.

09:22.582 --> 09:25.585
French toast, Mon amour?

09:28.655 --> 09:30.355
Damn it,
this is restaurant-quality.

09:30.356 --> 09:32.057
You know, it helps if
the brioche is fresh,

09:32.058 --> 09:35.193
so I stopped at the bakery
on the way back from my run.

09:35.194 --> 09:36.395
You already went on a run?

09:36.396 --> 09:37.596
Yeah, you were half-asleep.

09:37.597 --> 09:39.231
You mumbled something
about Taylor Swift,

09:39.232 --> 09:41.199
and then you rolled
over and farted.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.102
Your poached eggs should be
ready in three, two, one...

09:45.338 --> 09:47.373
There we go.

09:52.211 --> 09:55.013
Congratulations, everyone.
Your prayers have been answered,

09:55.014 --> 09:57.549
because Mindy Lahiri... ow!

09:57.550 --> 09:58.850
What the hell, dude?

09:58.851 --> 10:00.852
I am so sorry.
It just... it's...

10:00.853 --> 10:02.921
it's lunchtime pigskin.
Lunchtime pigskin.

10:02.922 --> 10:04.623
- Gosh!
- Sorry.

10:04.624 --> 10:05.891
Morgan and I were
just practicing

10:05.892 --> 10:07.426
for our family's weekend
touch football game.

10:07.427 --> 10:09.061
- Ho!
- Huh?

10:09.062 --> 10:11.496
Why would you be
invited to that?

10:11.497 --> 10:14.099
No, you're not hunting
him for sport, are you?

10:14.100 --> 10:16.568
No, we don't do that anymore.

10:16.569 --> 10:17.836
- Ah.
- Morgan's invited

10:17.837 --> 10:19.604
because he's Colette's
new boyfriend.

10:19.605 --> 10:21.139
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.041
There's my girl. What?

10:23.042 --> 10:24.810
Everyone's calling us

10:24.811 --> 10:26.611
Colorgan, which I hate.

10:26.612 --> 10:27.713
Guys, please.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.716
Yes, I love men,

10:30.717 --> 10:32.984
I love being in
this relationship.

10:32.985 --> 10:34.019
Mm.

10:34.020 --> 10:36.221
What a hot and natural couple.

10:36.222 --> 10:38.123
Isn't it?
Morgan is a fine young man.

10:38.124 --> 10:39.291
We're going golfing later.

10:39.292 --> 10:41.026
Uh, by golf,
you mean the Frisbee variety?

10:41.027 --> 10:43.762
Morgan,
you are a panic.

10:43.763 --> 10:45.197
- I love it.
- I know.

10:45.198 --> 10:46.698
- Oh!
- Catch!

10:46.699 --> 10:49.034
- Come on, shnookums.
- That's my boyfriend.

10:49.035 --> 10:51.370
Now excuse me,
but would you mind if I ask:

10:51.371 --> 10:53.038
What are you doing back here?

10:53.039 --> 10:54.439
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.807
That's like asking
Rihanna what she's doing

10:55.808 --> 10:56.842
at the Met Ball.

10:56.843 --> 10:57.976
I'm the queen of this ish.

10:57.977 --> 11:00.145
But, if you must know,

11:00.146 --> 11:01.480
Danny's taking care of our baby

11:01.481 --> 11:03.715
and I am covering his workload.

11:03.716 --> 11:05.317
So the hysterectomy I was
going to do with Danny,

11:05.318 --> 11:06.318
now I'm doing it with you?

11:06.319 --> 11:07.652
Yeah, man. Yeah.

11:07.653 --> 11:09.020
You bet your sweet ass you are.

11:09.021 --> 11:10.188
And we're gonna listen
to my playlist, so I hope

11:10.189 --> 11:12.457
you like "Monster Mash"
and Tracy Chapman.

11:12.458 --> 11:13.992
God!

11:13.993 --> 11:16.361
I'm so sorry!

11:16.362 --> 11:18.897
Well, Leo,
today is gonna be easy as pie.

11:18.898 --> 11:20.900
Speaking of which...

11:22.869 --> 11:24.870
Yeah.

11:24.871 --> 11:26.638
Yeah, looks good, right?

11:26.639 --> 11:29.040
Okay, let me cross
that off the to-do-list.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.309
"Bake apple pie." We're
right on schedule.

11:31.310 --> 11:33.078
Go to the pediatrician early,
we'll still have time

11:33.079 --> 11:34.913
to work on
our Italian flashcards.

11:34.914 --> 11:36.782
What's next?
Cable guy's five minutes late.

11:36.783 --> 11:37.849
That's okay, right?

11:37.850 --> 11:39.718
That's why
we schedule wiggle room.

11:39.719 --> 11:41.586
Oh... whoop!

11:41.587 --> 11:44.589
Rattle down. I'll get it.

11:44.590 --> 11:46.992
Oh, damn it. Um...

11:46.993 --> 11:49.961
Okay, that's okay. No worries.

11:49.962 --> 11:53.498
That's why you always
bake a second pie.

11:53.499 --> 11:55.267
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

11:55.268 --> 11:56.735
What the hell are you
doing with Colette?

11:56.736 --> 11:58.136
We're dating and we're in love.

11:58.137 --> 12:00.005
Okay. That's obviously not true.

12:00.006 --> 12:02.674
Morgan, you cannot turn
gay people straight.

12:02.675 --> 12:03.842
I know, I know. Listen, listen.

12:03.843 --> 12:05.644
Okay, Colette asked
me to be the beard

12:05.645 --> 12:06.845
at her grandfather's wedding,

12:06.846 --> 12:08.713
but now Dr. K is
treating me like family.

12:08.714 --> 12:10.282
He took me on his boat.

12:10.283 --> 12:12.284
No one has ever done
that and brought me back.

12:12.285 --> 12:14.186
You cannot keep a Southern
family's gay secret

12:14.187 --> 12:15.420
for personal gain.

12:15.421 --> 12:17.689
What are you,
in a Tennessee Williams play?

12:17.690 --> 12:19.324
Whoa, am I smart?

12:19.325 --> 12:20.892
You shouldn't help Colette lie.

12:20.893 --> 12:23.361
And this is coming from
someone who loves to lie.

12:23.362 --> 12:24.563
I need more time.

12:24.564 --> 12:25.630
Jody's teaching me how
to play the spoons.

your way to the kitchen

12:38.578 --> 12:40.345
if you would like some
leftover gravy and peas.

12:40.346 --> 12:42.781

so how long's it gonna be?

12:54.093 --> 12:55.193

I think we deserve a treat.

13:50.650 --> 13:53.118
Whoa. The flask?

13:53.119 --> 13:55.520
Mine was confiscated at
the American Girl store.

13:55.521 --> 13:56.555
What is this? Mike's Hard?

How about your last day of work?

14:09.235 --> 14:11.269
I can't believe I'm saying this.

14:11.270 --> 14:12.737
I'm sorry you won't
be there tomorrow

14:12.738 --> 14:14.673
to assist in
my triplet delivery.

14:14.674 --> 14:17.609
Yeah. I need to be
home with my son.

14:17.610 --> 14:18.910
You know, Danny's right.

14:18.911 --> 14:20.211
A child needs his doctor mother

14:20.212 --> 14:21.613
to be home to clean the floors

14:21.614 --> 14:23.582
and to prepare
the father gourmet food.

14:23.583 --> 14:25.016
And that's what
I want to be doing.

14:25.017 --> 14:26.051
So...

14:26.052 --> 14:27.886
Sounds like you
need another sip.

14:27.887 --> 14:29.421
Uh, no?

14:29.422 --> 14:30.822
You already drank it all.

14:30.823 --> 14:31.958
Yeah.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.860
Come in.

14:35.861 --> 14:37.062
Oh, good, you're still here.

14:37.063 --> 14:38.096
I thought you were gone.

14:38.097 --> 14:39.431
No, no, no, no, I'm still here.

14:39.432 --> 14:40.966
Still working mom
till the end of the day.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.767
Good, because I need
something feminine

14:42.768 --> 14:44.369
to wear to my grandpa's wedding.

14:44.370 --> 14:46.972
This is the only dress I own.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.873
It was from my first communion.

14:48.874 --> 14:50.575
Colette, we need to talk.

14:50.576 --> 14:51.876
Sit down.

14:51.877 --> 14:53.812
You have to tell
your brother the truth.

14:53.813 --> 14:55.347
If you are not living
your authentic self,

14:55.348 --> 14:56.982
what even was
the point of "Glee?"

14:56.983 --> 14:58.450
Well, the problem's Jody.

14:58.451 --> 15:00.118
I just... I love him so much,

15:00.119 --> 15:02.287
I... I want to be
the... the girly-girl

15:02.288 --> 15:04.155
he's always wanted me to be.

15:04.156 --> 15:05.991
Even if that means
I have to lie.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.092
Forever.

15:07.093 --> 15:08.093
You shouldn't hide who you are

15:08.094 --> 15:10.296
from someone you love.

15:12.498 --> 15:14.332
Oh, my God.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.900
I'm in the closet too.

15:15.901 --> 15:17.769
Definitely not. Like, hard no.

15:17.770 --> 15:19.504
Not even close.

15:19.505 --> 15:22.474
Yes, but I'm keeping a secret
from a man that I love.

15:22.475 --> 15:23.808
I'll tell you a secret.

15:23.809 --> 15:25.644
I don't wanna be
a stay-at-home mom.

15:25.645 --> 15:26.845
I want to come to work.

15:26.846 --> 15:28.513
I just... I don't know
how to tell Danny.

15:28.514 --> 15:31.050
Well if he loves you,
he'll understand.

15:33.786 --> 15:36.421
I guess I gotta tell
Jody the truth too.

15:36.422 --> 15:39.924
I just gotta find a way
to tell him delicately.

15:39.925 --> 15:41.526
Hey, boo.

15:41.527 --> 15:43.395
Jody is starting
to get suspicious,

15:43.396 --> 15:45.196
so you and I have to
start openly kissing,

15:45.197 --> 15:46.398
and maybe get a little grab-sy.

15:46.399 --> 15:48.033
Oh, God, no! No!

15:48.034 --> 15:49.134
Ugh!

15:49.135 --> 15:51.036
God.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.405
Hey, everybody. It's Colette.

15:53.406 --> 15:54.806
I'm a lesbian.

15:54.807 --> 15:56.508
Over and out.

15:56.509 --> 15:57.509
I'm proud of you.

15:57.510 --> 15:59.077
I feel so good!

15:59.078 --> 16:01.112
Colette!

16:01.113 --> 16:04.116
No!

16:09.989 --> 16:12.557
Colette,
you're not really gay, are you?

16:12.558 --> 16:14.125
I mean, this is just another
one of your funny pranks, right?

16:14.126 --> 16:15.660
Like when you kissed
that girl in your class,

16:15.661 --> 16:17.962
or asked that girl to prom?

16:17.963 --> 16:19.864
Oh, dear.

16:19.865 --> 16:21.266
It's not a prank, Jody.

16:21.267 --> 16:22.967
Listen, she's not gay.
Relax, okay?

16:22.968 --> 16:25.103
This is just a ruse
so I will propose to her,

16:25.104 --> 16:26.171
and it's working.
Colette, I love you.

16:26.172 --> 16:27.472
- No, I... yeah...
- I just need a minute.

16:27.473 --> 16:28.673
This is all so shocking.

16:28.674 --> 16:29.808
Really?

16:29.809 --> 16:31.176
Every Halloween
I went as John Elway.

16:31.177 --> 16:32.744
It's not that you're gay.

16:32.745 --> 16:34.212
I've known plenty of gays.

16:34.213 --> 16:35.513
Heck, half the guys
in boarding school

16:35.514 --> 16:36.881
were messing around
with each other.

16:36.882 --> 16:38.616
Amen, sister.

16:38.617 --> 16:39.851
Wait, then why are you so upset?

16:39.852 --> 16:41.653
Because I love you, Colette,

16:41.654 --> 16:43.755
and now your life isn't gonna
be the one I pictured for you,

16:43.756 --> 16:45.090
and neither will mine.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.458
I mean, now I'll never
have a brother-in-law.

16:46.459 --> 16:47.992
We were gonna grill together,

16:47.993 --> 16:49.060
complain about our wives.

16:49.061 --> 16:51.696
Jody, don't you get it?

16:51.697 --> 16:53.798
I'm gonna be
that brother-in-law.

16:53.799 --> 16:54.966
What do you mean?

16:54.967 --> 16:56.468
I like dumb blondes
just like you do.

16:56.469 --> 16:58.536
I mean, we're both gonna
marry hot trophy wives

16:58.537 --> 16:59.838
who love to shop.

16:59.839 --> 17:00.939
With
really big breasts.

17:00.940 --> 17:02.173
The biggest.

17:02.174 --> 17:03.508
This coming out is
getting less touching.

17:03.509 --> 17:05.210
And who do you think's
gonna sit on the bench

17:05.211 --> 17:07.145
at the mall,
holding their purses?

17:07.146 --> 17:08.980
- Me and you.
- Damn right!

17:08.981 --> 17:11.449
- Come here.
- Oh!

17:11.450 --> 17:14.886
Okay, okay.

17:14.887 --> 17:16.988
Thanks, Dr. Lahiri,
for the advice.

17:16.989 --> 17:20.023
I'm really glad
I said how I feel.

17:20.025 --> 17:22.594
I don't care if you're gay,
or straight,

17:22.595 --> 17:24.996
or trans.

17:24.997 --> 17:25.997
I'm in love with you,
and all that matters

17:25.998 --> 17:27.499
is that you are my girlfriend.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.300
- No.
- Coulda been the best.

17:29.301 --> 17:30.969
- Don't.
- You coulda had the best.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.437
Hey, sweetheart.

17:32.438 --> 17:35.608
Don't worry,
I had a hard first day too.

17:37.109 --> 17:39.277
Hey, babe.

17:39.278 --> 17:41.012
Oh, my God, are you painting?

17:41.013 --> 17:43.481
Yeah, it's just watercolors.

17:43.482 --> 17:46.151
Relaxes me.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.652
This place looks amazing.

17:47.653 --> 17:49.187
Oh, I don't know if
it looks amazing.

17:49.188 --> 17:51.156
I mean, I almost didn't
get to wax the floor

17:51.157 --> 17:52.924
because I was glazing the duck.

17:52.925 --> 17:56.261
Somehow, miraculously,
I managed to do both.

17:56.262 --> 17:57.328
You did both.

17:57.329 --> 17:58.664
Hey, have a seat.

18:02.401 --> 18:04.736
Now I'm gonna wash up,
and we'll say grace, okay?

18:04.737 --> 18:06.272
Okay.

18:10.409 --> 18:13.444
Hey, Leo. We need to talk.

18:13.445 --> 18:15.914
Thing is, genetically speaking,

18:15.915 --> 18:18.483
you're half your dad
and half me,

18:18.484 --> 18:21.019
which is mostly a good thing.

18:21.020 --> 18:22.987
Probably inherit your dad's hair

18:22.988 --> 18:25.356
and my ability to
remember sleights.

18:25.357 --> 18:27.358
And I really hope you
inherit your dad's ability

18:27.359 --> 18:30.428
to be great at
everything he tries.

18:30.429 --> 18:32.463
But you might be like me,

18:32.464 --> 18:35.333
and I'm only great at one thing:

18:35.334 --> 18:37.168
My job.

18:37.169 --> 18:39.404
God, you shoulda seen
me in the surgery today.

18:39.405 --> 18:41.639
Even Karen the anesthesiologist
gave me a high-five,

18:41.640 --> 18:44.342
and I've told you
what a bitch she is.

18:44.343 --> 18:48.343
I just want you to be
proud of me, baby...

18:48.981 --> 18:51.249
which is why I have
to go back to work.

18:51.250 --> 18:55.254
I just don't know how
to tell your dad yet.

18:58.991 --> 19:00.825
Wait a second.

19:00.826 --> 19:03.628
That's a hotel-quality
bed corner.

19:05.464 --> 19:08.266
It's so tidy in there!

19:08.267 --> 19:09.367
Ah, thanks.

19:09.368 --> 19:11.870
Well, you know,
what I like the most

19:11.871 --> 19:13.671
was this towel swan.

19:13.672 --> 19:15.607
- What?
- This towel swan that you made.

19:15.608 --> 19:17.175
The swan I made out of a towel.

19:17.176 --> 19:19.811
It's funny, because
I remember you telling me

19:19.812 --> 19:22.714
that origami was disrespectful
to Pearl Harbor vets.

19:22.715 --> 19:24.816
Oh, no, no, no, I changed
my mind on that whole theory.

19:24.817 --> 19:26.551
Well, since I'm gonna
be home tomorrow,

19:26.552 --> 19:29.921
thought maybe you could,
uh... show me how you did it.

19:29.922 --> 19:31.689
- The towel swan?
- Yeah.

19:31.690 --> 19:34.492
See, that's... oh, yes.

19:34.493 --> 19:37.195
Once over there...
And then we, uh...

19:37.196 --> 19:38.396
- Hmm.
- These towels are a little

19:38.397 --> 19:40.932
starchy right now, but, uh...

19:40.933 --> 19:43.668
No, that doesn't
look like a swan.

19:43.669 --> 19:46.971
Cross over, and then we, uh...

19:46.972 --> 19:49.574
- What's that?
- The gun in "The Godfather."

19:49.575 --> 19:50.942
That sucks. Give that to me.

19:50.943 --> 19:52.277
Here. Okay.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.078
- I cannot believe you.
- What?

19:54.079 --> 19:55.780
You brought
your mother in as a ringer

19:55.781 --> 19:56.781
to make me look bad.

19:56.782 --> 19:58.483
Fine. I had help, okay?

19:58.484 --> 19:59.651
But it wasn't to
make you look bad.

19:59.652 --> 20:02.053
It was...

20:02.054 --> 20:03.621
it was because you were right.

20:03.622 --> 20:05.723
My schedule was in
shreds by 12:00.

20:05.724 --> 20:08.159
I called Ma crying. Okay?

20:08.160 --> 20:10.295
I couldn't do it.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.596
It's hard.

20:11.597 --> 20:13.298
It's really hard.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.767
I wasn't lying,
like my allergy to vegetables.

20:15.768 --> 20:17.302
I don't know how you do it.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.271
I changed my shirt,
like, four times.

20:20.272 --> 20:22.140
He just... he saw a new
shirt come, he was like...

20:22.141 --> 20:24.008
- Blech.
- Yeah, big challenge.

20:24.009 --> 20:26.611
Did he do that thing
where he's clearly crying

20:26.612 --> 20:29.048
but there's no sound coming out,
he's like...

20:30.282 --> 20:31.749
Yeah, that's exactly
what he does.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.384
By the way,
we're switching to those diapers

20:33.385 --> 20:34.652
that are bad for
the environment.

20:34.653 --> 20:36.821
I've already been using them,
actually.

20:36.822 --> 20:38.556
I keep them in
the ceiling with my candy.

20:38.557 --> 20:40.158
I'm a lucky guy.

20:40.159 --> 20:41.592
I'm with someone
that actually wants

20:41.593 --> 20:43.861
to do this every day.

20:43.862 --> 20:45.797
I have to talk to
you about something.

20:45.798 --> 20:46.965
What's up?

20:46.966 --> 20:48.266
I haven't been...

20:48.267 --> 20:51.035
- Sorry,
hold on one sec.

20:51.036 --> 20:53.938
Hey, Little Danny,
how's my favorite half-sister?

20:53.939 --> 20:56.674
What's up on the Worst Coast?

20:56.675 --> 20:59.277
You don't need to cry.
I'm only joking around with you.

20:59.278 --> 21:01.046
California's not...

21:02.748 --> 21:04.016
Wait, what?

21:06.552 --> 21:09.521
My dad had a heart attack.

21:11.275 --> 21:12.623
Okay, Little Danny, well,
I'm gonna... I'm gonna

21:12.624 --> 21:14.425
get out there as soon as I can.

21:14.426 --> 21:16.661
Just call me if
anything changes.

21:16.662 --> 21:18.396
Okay.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.233
Are you okay?

21:22.234 --> 21:24.268
He's stable, but...

21:24.269 --> 21:26.170
Son of a bitch smoked
his whole life.

21:26.171 --> 21:27.872
I mean, I told him, "You can't...

21:27.873 --> 21:30.074
"You gotta exercise,
Dad," and he ate like crap,

21:30.075 --> 21:31.743
I mean, it's no surprise.

21:32.811 --> 21:34.479
Okay. I gotta get out there.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.613
I mean, I don't know
what kind of doctors

21:35.614 --> 21:38.483
he has out there.

21:38.484 --> 21:40.084
I got a delivery on Wednesday.

21:40.085 --> 21:41.219
What are they gonna
do in the office

21:41.220 --> 21:43.988
without either one of us?

21:44.990 --> 21:46.057
Damn, what am I talking about?

21:46.058 --> 21:47.425
I can't go.

21:47.426 --> 21:49.927
I... we have a son.
I'm not... no, no, no.

21:49.928 --> 21:51.796
I'm... I'm... I'm not gonna go.
I gotta stay with Leo.

21:51.797 --> 21:53.531
It's okay, it's okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

21:53.532 --> 21:54.866
I'm gonna help you pack,
and then

21:54.867 --> 21:55.867
you're gonna go out there
and be with your dad

21:55.868 --> 21:57.568
and with your sister.

21:57.569 --> 22:00.004
And then, I'm gonna go back
to work while you're gone,

22:00.005 --> 22:01.739
and your mom can
take care of Leo

22:01.740 --> 22:04.442
like she did today, and...

22:04.443 --> 22:06.444
It's gonna be okay.

22:09.048 --> 22:11.182
Oh, God, you're the best.

22:11.183 --> 22:14.052
Thank you.

22:14.053 --> 22:15.453
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

22:15.454 --> 22:17.055
It's gonna be okay, right?

22:17.056 --> 22:19.924
Uh... I'm gonna...

22:19.925 --> 22:22.026
I'm gonna call Richie.

22:22.027 --> 22:24.128
Thank you, babe.

22:24.129 --> 22:26.384
I'm actually happy
to go back to work.
