00:02.669 --> 00:03.602
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:04.770
- This book had
a huge impact

00:04.772 --> 00:05.938
On my journey
as a writer.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.406
Maybe it can do the same
for you.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.408
- Matty, this is
my friend bailey.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.410
- Thank you for coming.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.644
Prom.
- Prom.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.512
- I just wanted
to make sure

00:13.514 --> 00:17.216
That you were cool
with me asking bailey.

00:23.690 --> 00:27.626
- So you want
to take bailey to prom.

00:27.628 --> 00:31.597
- Is that okay?

00:31.599 --> 00:34.066
- It's awesome.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.601
Fantastic.
She's fantastic.

00:35.603 --> 00:39.538
You're fantastic.
It's--it's fantastic.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.173
She's gonna be stoked.
- You think so?

00:41.175 --> 00:45.411
- Why wouldn't she?
You're matty mckibben.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.713
And I was
jenna hamilton,

00:47.715 --> 00:49.148
The idiot
who finally knew

00:49.150 --> 00:50.416
She had permanently
messed up

00:50.418 --> 00:53.252
The best relationship
she'd ever have.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.121
[door closes]

00:58.825 --> 01:01.126
- [laughs]
what did he say?

01:01.128 --> 01:03.495
How did he ask?

01:03.497 --> 01:05.931
- He's taking someone else.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.567
- Oh.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.203
Sweetie.

01:11.205 --> 01:16.141
- Can I just be alone?

01:16.143 --> 01:17.810
- Of course.

01:17.812 --> 01:22.081
[sighs]

01:24.250 --> 01:26.151
- I was a fool to think
all the bad

01:26.153 --> 01:27.653
I had put
into the universe

01:27.655 --> 01:30.923
Could so easily
be forgotten.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.157
Matty's rebound
with devon

01:32.159 --> 01:34.693
Had paved the way
for the real deal.

01:34.695 --> 01:38.664
And the real deal was
not going to be me.

01:38.666 --> 01:42.201
It was going
to be bailey.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.539
[soft music]

01:47.541 --> 01:54.847
â™ª

01:55.381 --> 01:57.649
- I naively thought
I was finally back

01:57.651 --> 01:59.852
On solid ground,
but the sad truth

01:59.854 --> 02:02.821
Revealed that my foundation
was too weak

02:02.823 --> 02:05.524
To handle
a simple rejection.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.826
I was
falling apart, unraveling,

02:07.828 --> 02:11.130
And there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

02:11.132 --> 02:16.335
I had to make
a virtual escape.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.847
At the height of my despair
over a boy,

02:28.849 --> 02:33.118
I had strangely found solace
in the arms of a man--

02:33.120 --> 02:34.686
Russell jonathan.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.155
His tale
of self-destruction

02:36.157 --> 02:38.657
Followed by eventual
self-redemption

02:38.659 --> 02:40.392
Was like food
for my soul.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.929
It was as if he was speaking
directly to me about me,

02:43.931 --> 02:46.098
And all I wanted to do
was crawl back

02:46.100 --> 02:47.933
Into the comfort
of his words.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.168
So I did,

02:49.170 --> 02:54.439
Because the book had become
my new obsession...

02:56.075 --> 02:57.009
And distraction.

02:57.011 --> 03:01.313
I was reading it over,
and over, and over again,

03:01.315 --> 03:02.614
Using it
as my excuse

03:02.616 --> 03:07.052
To excuse myself
from life.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.189
It had become
my security blanket,

03:10.191 --> 03:15.494
And I didn't want to leave
the safety of its pages.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.763
- Earth to jenna.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.064
You there?

03:19.066 --> 03:21.934
- Hey, I was reading that.
- Uh, we know.

03:21.936 --> 03:22.901
But when are you gonna
be done?

03:22.903 --> 03:25.337
- I don't know.
Let's find out.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.473
- How about engaging in life
for a minute?

03:28.475 --> 03:31.643
Converse with your parents,
call your friends,

03:31.645 --> 03:33.946
Or hell, at least read
another book

03:33.948 --> 03:35.814
By the same guy.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.983
- Oh, my god.
Genius.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.586
That thought
hadn't even crossed my mind.

03:40.588 --> 03:44.256
- No good deed
goes unpunished.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.724
- The idea
that my new love affair

03:45.726 --> 03:47.492
With russell jonathan
could continue

03:47.494 --> 03:52.231
To grow and evolve
was beyond comprehension.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.765
Not only was
I on a quest

03:53.767 --> 03:55.200
To find out more
about his work,

03:55.202 --> 03:58.370
I suddenly needed to know
everything about the man,

03:58.372 --> 04:01.306
The man who was changing my life
word by word,

04:01.308 --> 04:03.342
The man who just totally
and completely

04:03.344 --> 04:06.011
Spoke to my heart,
the man who was maybe

04:06.013 --> 04:10.983
My soul mate
and who was--

04:10.985 --> 04:15.053
Mr. Hart?

04:16.990 --> 04:17.822
I had been rocked.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.391
The world as I knew it
was suddenly

04:19.392 --> 04:21.459
Very unsettled
and confused.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.295
Matty was taking bailey
to prom,

04:23.297 --> 04:25.464
And I was possibly
having feelings

04:25.466 --> 04:27.833
For my newfound
literary hero,

04:27.835 --> 04:30.602
Russell jonathan,
aka mr. Hart.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.604
Could it be
that hart's disgusting

04:32.606 --> 04:35.841
And disgruntled demeanor
was just a facade

04:35.843 --> 04:37.976
Hiding a uniquely
beautiful man?

04:37.978 --> 04:41.280
Or was he just the most
brilliant writer

04:41.282 --> 04:42.314
I had ever read?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.082
Either way,
I felt bamboozled.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.652
- All right.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.820
You lucky
remaining half-wits,

04:48.822 --> 04:50.922
We're gonna learn something
today called a "callback."

04:50.924 --> 04:53.392
It's your last assignment
of the year.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.494
Does anybody know
what that is?

04:55.496 --> 04:56.728
Anyone?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.063
Okay, let me give you
a clue.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.867
What did I ask you
on the first day of class?

05:04.604 --> 05:05.304
Peep show.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.205
- You asked us
to give you permission

05:07.207 --> 05:08.040
To torture us.

05:08.042 --> 05:10.876
- Yes.
Yes, I did.

05:10.878 --> 05:11.710
And have
you been tortured?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.478
- I've been standing
in the hall

05:13.480 --> 05:15.280
Every day
for the last two months.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.049
- You see?
I was true to my word.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.917
And my only hope
is that one day,

05:18.919 --> 05:21.219
You'll all remember
to be true to yours.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.121
But that wasn't
the question.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.457
Anyone else?
- You asked if we were morons.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.927
- I did, and you are,
but that's not it.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.029
- What about the time you asked
if we were inbred?

05:31.031 --> 05:33.865
- No, that was just
for you.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.168
Seriously, guys.
It's not that hard.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.871
Mr. Jennings,
no insightful retort?

05:43.109 --> 05:46.244
- No.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.512
- I have it.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.980
You asked who we want
to be.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.782
- And bingo was
his name-o.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.652
Very good, so now,
it's time for all of you

05:53.654 --> 05:56.054
To reflect
on the past year

05:56.056 --> 05:57.255
And write me
an opus

05:57.257 --> 06:00.092
About who you want
to be.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.694
- [sighs]

06:02.696 --> 06:05.831
- Due tomorrow.
[bell rings]

06:05.833 --> 06:07.999
Tomorrow.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.836
Hey, uh, hamilton.
Not so fast.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.104
What was
that sigh about?

06:12.106 --> 06:13.572
- I-I didn't sigh.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.607
- Oh, you did.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.174
- Okay, fine.

06:16.176 --> 06:19.945
I sighed because I don't know
who I want to be,

06:19.947 --> 06:21.580
Let alone
who I am.

06:21.582 --> 06:26.752
But I do know
who you are, russ.

06:30.423 --> 06:31.857
I had stoked
the fire

06:31.859 --> 06:34.159
And let mr. Hart know
what I knew.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.827
But what I still
didn't know was

06:35.829 --> 06:38.096
If I was infatuated
with him.

06:38.098 --> 06:42.100
I am struggling with
some strange romantic feelings.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.702
- Mm.
Unrequited love.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.804
- I don't know
if I would call it "love."

06:45.806 --> 06:47.672
The feelings are
potentially irrational

06:47.674 --> 06:49.441
And reactionary
towards feeling lonely,

06:49.443 --> 06:50.809
Not to mention
the age difference

06:50.811 --> 06:51.510
Is totally sketch.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.511
- I'm pretty sure
I know

06:52.513 --> 06:53.445
Who you're
talking about.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.147
It's not that big
of an age difference.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.381
- Are you kidding?
It's massive.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.783
- Well, I guess
if we're counting in cat years.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.519
- Did I mention that a union
would be illegal?

07:00.521 --> 07:03.488
And gross?
- In what state?

07:03.490 --> 07:05.590
Maybe delaware.
- What is wrong with me?

07:05.592 --> 07:06.858
It's not like
I actually believe

07:06.860 --> 07:10.629
That I'm in love with him
or anything.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.164
Inspired, sure.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.166
But is it possible
to love someone

07:14.168 --> 07:15.467
Who enjoys
humiliating you?

07:15.469 --> 07:17.369
- I'm not so sure
he enjoys it,

07:17.371 --> 07:18.970
And remember
it takes two to tango.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.239
- What?
I-I've never humiliated him.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.642
- We could debate the details
all day,

07:23.644 --> 07:25.811
But the truth is
you seem really pained

07:25.813 --> 07:28.647
By this whole situation,
and frankly, I get it,

07:28.649 --> 07:31.183
With everyone talking about it
and all.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.485
- Eh--everyone knows?

07:33.487 --> 07:35.020
I haven't told
a soul.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.955
- Well, your mom told me.
- My mom knows?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.957
- Yeah, and then
I told some kids

07:38.959 --> 07:41.693
Who may or may not have
blabber of the mouth.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.161
But come on,
did you really think

07:43.163 --> 07:44.296
He was gonna ask you
to prom

07:44.298 --> 07:46.331
After everything
that happened?

07:46.333 --> 07:49.067
- Why would mr. Hart
ask me to prom?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.702
- Mr. Hart?

07:50.704 --> 07:51.837
Ugh.
No.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.538
I'm not talking about
that old perv.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.474
He's not even allowed
at the prom.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.741
It's too much cleavage.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.276
- Uh, then who are
you talking about?

07:58.278 --> 08:01.780
- Matty.
I heard he dissed you.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.448
- Everyone's talking
about that?

08:03.450 --> 08:05.484
- Psh.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.918
No.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.454
Not everyone.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.523
Mary at the front desk
didn't know

08:11.525 --> 08:14.459
Until I told her.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.162
Do you want
my advice?

08:17.164 --> 08:17.896
Reinvent yourself

08:17.898 --> 08:21.833
Before you're the butt
of everyone's joke.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.035
- Seemed like val had gone back
to the crack pipe.

08:24.037 --> 08:27.305
There was no way I was the butt
of everyone's joke.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.675
No one cared what happened
with me and matty.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.677
- Finally, jenna got
a wake-up call.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.011
She's not all that.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.447
- Matty definitely
traded up.

08:35.448 --> 08:39.284
Bailey parker's the new
and improved version of jenna.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.385
- Yeah, what did
jenna expect

08:40.386 --> 08:44.289
After being so selfish
and insensitive?

08:44.291 --> 08:47.792
Karma's a bitch.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.729
- Karma had been a bitch,
and so had I,

08:50.731 --> 08:53.698
Which meant there was no room
for a pity committee.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.867
- I deserved the bum rap
and the pain

08:55.869 --> 08:56.902
That came along
with it.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.336
[knocks at door]
- jenna?

08:58.338 --> 09:00.505
- Yeah?
- Why are you holing up in here?

09:00.507 --> 09:02.541
- Just feels more comfortable
in the toilets

09:02.543 --> 09:03.775
Since I feel
like [bleep].

09:03.777 --> 09:05.210
- The rumor's
not that bad.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.711
I mean,
no one really cares.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.713
[toilet flushes]

09:08.715 --> 09:10.248
- Omg, they do.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.618
Everyone's been rooting
for jenna to f.O.H.F.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.888
- F.O.H.F?
- Fall on her face.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.658
- Eh, good try,
but no.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.960
- Don't listen to her.
She is old and out of touch.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.930
- No, I'm out of touch.
- It's my fault.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.631
I had the wrong intel
on the prom ask.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.433
When jake said matty was
about to ask someone,

09:28.435 --> 09:29.501
I just assumed
it was you.

09:29.503 --> 09:30.602
I'm the one
who got your hopes up.

09:30.604 --> 09:34.606
- Not if I was already living
in la-la land.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.508
I've been in denial.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.142
- Please come out.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.811
I promise no one will mention
prom at our lunch table.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.315
- Prom, I don't know
what I'm gonna do about it.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.250
- Sorry, forgot
to give her the memo.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.018
- It's okay.
So what's the deal?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.955
- Sex, it's as if
it's in the fine print

09:49.957 --> 09:51.256
Of every prom ticket,

09:51.258 --> 09:52.857
But I'm not ready.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.293
- Easy, use a sexcuse.
- Sexcuse?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.095
- Sex excuse.
- For example?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.296
- You're tired.
- Sweaty.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.431
- Hairy.
- Which means scary.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.632
- Or just go
with the irrefutable.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.633
- Something commonly practiced

10:01.635 --> 10:02.467
From the beginning
of time.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.470
- Which is?
Both: You have your period.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.907
- Oh, man.
Sucks to be you.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.277
So anyway, jenna,
are you coming with us?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.078
- Alone?
- Sure.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.480
We took tamara for the formal
last year.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.415
Why can't we take you
this year?

10:17.417 --> 10:18.583
- That's a great idea.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.250
- And really nice,

10:19.252 --> 10:20.652
But I don't wanna be
in the way

10:20.654 --> 10:23.021
Or make things uncomfortable
with matty and bailey.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.391
- You won't.
They're not even going.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.560
I think he changed
his mind.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.061
- And I had changed
my attitude.

10:30.063 --> 10:34.265
Hope was alive, and well,
and still on the premises.

10:37.103 --> 10:37.636
[bell rings]

10:37.638 --> 10:39.704
- With matty plus none
for the dance,

10:39.706 --> 10:42.374
I had to find a way
to become his plus one.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.110
But I needed more intel
on his state of mind,

10:45.112 --> 10:49.314
And to get it,
I needed reinforcements.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.782
- That sounds complicated.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.283
- It's not complicated

10:52.285 --> 10:54.653
Because the only guy for me
is jc,

10:54.655 --> 10:55.787
And I only see him
at church.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.422
And there's no way
he's going to prom,

10:57.424 --> 11:00.425
So you, austin, and I
should all go together.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.326
- What are we gonna do,

11:01.328 --> 11:02.193
Be a three-way freak show

11:02.195 --> 11:05.163
Where you hold my hips
as I slow dance with austin?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.564
- [gasps]
oh, that sounds fun.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.366
[giggles]
- no, it doesn't.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.368
You're giving me anxiety
which I don't need

11:10.370 --> 11:11.770
Because I've gained
three pounds,

11:11.772 --> 11:12.470
And I promised austin

11:12.472 --> 11:14.305
I wouldn't
scarf and barf anymore.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.474
- He knows?
- Yes, he knows everything.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.144
His lack of a social filter
also comes

11:19.146 --> 11:20.478
With a lack of judgment.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.479
He just likes me
for me.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.848
And now, I've moved
into a sphere

11:23.850 --> 11:24.649
Beyond like for him.

11:24.651 --> 11:29.454
Liss, I think
I'm in love.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.288
- No.
- Yes.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.691
- No, really,
now you're freaking me out.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.926
- Why?
- Because you're you.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.095
And you are not a lover.
- Yes, I am.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.930
- No, you're not.
- Stop saying that.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.766
- You stop saying it.
- I love austin.

11:41.768 --> 11:45.003
And I am freaking out.
I even have butterflies.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.171
And I hate butterflies.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.807
And if you tell anyone I'm
having this soft side moment,

11:48.809 --> 11:50.375
I swear
I will cut you.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.210
- [sighs]
you're back.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.347
Thank goodness.
I was starting to worry.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.551
- Ah.
What's with the sneak attack?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.352
- Oh, no one's sneaking.
- Or attacking.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.021
But we have some questions.
- Okay.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.824
- We suspect you've withheld
some pertinent information

12:05.826 --> 12:06.758
About matty
and bailey.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.094
- Babe, I just found out
earlier in the day,

12:09.096 --> 12:10.595
So now you know
all that I know.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.629
So you don't need
to wig out.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.698
- We're not wigging,
but rather wondering

12:13.700 --> 12:15.800
If matty's reason
for changing his mind

12:15.802 --> 12:17.902
Had anything to do
with another girl.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.805
- I.E. Jenna.
- I don't know.

12:20.807 --> 12:21.940
- You know.
- No, I don't.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.008
- Then, I do.
Jenna, it's clear.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.010
Matty never wanted
to ask bailey.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.645
He was just trying to suss out
how you felt

12:27.647 --> 12:28.513
And see
if you still cared.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.316
He was completely angling
to get a rise out of you.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.684
He was waiting for you
to contest

12:32.686 --> 12:33.852
So he could
spring the ask on you.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.054
But you didn't contest,
so he didn't ask.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.322
Following?
- Yeah.

12:37.324 --> 12:37.756
- No.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.759
- It's girl world, babe.
Just tune out until I'm done.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.860
So the whole thing
was a ruse.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.828
He's waiting for you
to say something.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.562
And now's your shot.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.431
Say something
and get that ask.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.932
- You think
that's a good idea?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.267
- No.
- Yes.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.603
- In boy world,
we don't think that hard.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.004
- Yeah, you do.
- [scoffs]

12:53.006 --> 12:54.806
- Matty is the quiet,
contemplative type,

12:54.808 --> 12:56.074
And I feel
extremely confident

12:56.076 --> 12:58.009
He's waiting for an opening
to ask you

12:58.011 --> 12:59.978
And just you,
so go.

12:59.980 --> 13:04.082
Get that ask.

13:04.084 --> 13:04.516
What?

13:04.518 --> 13:05.617
- Why do you always have
to steamroll me?

13:05.619 --> 13:07.285
- I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.020
- You always have to be
in control of everything.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.423
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.325
- Try me.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.193
- Fine.

13:15.195 --> 13:19.397
I'm gonna wear
a colored tux to prom.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.634
- [sighs]
great.

13:22.636 --> 13:23.968
What color?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.237
- It's a surprise.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.973
- Can't wait to see it.
- Ah.

13:28.975 --> 13:29.908
- Mm-hmm.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.644
- If tamara's reasoning
was correct,

13:32.646 --> 13:35.079
Matty was waiting
for an opening from me,

13:35.081 --> 13:37.949
Which meant I had to do my best
to give him one

13:37.951 --> 13:40.785
And be as subtle
as possible about it.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.587
Matty.
Hey.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.323
I need a date to prom.
Any ideas?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.592
So subtlety wasn't
my strong suit.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.261
- I will have
to think it over.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.863
- He was playing
hard to get.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.431
Okay, well,
how about thinking

13:53.433 --> 13:55.466
About someone you'd wanna share
a limo with

13:55.468 --> 13:56.968
So we can
ride together?

13:56.970 --> 13:59.671
- I'm not going.
- Oh, no.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.906
Why?
Don't you want to go?

14:01.908 --> 14:05.777
- I did,
but not anymore.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.312
- How come?

14:07.314 --> 14:08.680
- Bailey said "no."

14:08.682 --> 14:12.116
And honestly, there's
no one else I wanna ask.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.986
But I will put
my thinking cap on for you,

14:14.988 --> 14:19.123
And we'll find you
a date.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.494
- So there would be
no date,

14:23.496 --> 14:25.163
No dance,

14:25.165 --> 14:28.366
Just devastation.

14:30.502 --> 14:31.402
- I had to write
my last paper,

14:31.404 --> 14:33.972
But all I wanted to do
was hole up and hide.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.107
I couldn't write about
who I wanted to be

14:36.109 --> 14:39.344
When I felt so far away
from who I was,

14:39.346 --> 14:40.511
Who I used to be.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.547
That girl who used
to be selfless

14:42.549 --> 14:45.016
Had become selfish,
and in turn

14:45.018 --> 14:47.252
Was all alone
without a prom date,

14:47.254 --> 14:51.489
A perfect boyfriend,
or a great new friend,

14:51.491 --> 14:53.258
A friend
that I had overtly avoided

14:53.260 --> 14:54.893
And ignored
for the last few days,

14:54.895 --> 14:59.731
Assuming she was
matty's new girl.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.500
I suddenly had
two assignments--

15:02.502 --> 15:03.968
To say something
on the page

15:03.970 --> 15:05.503
And to bailey
in person.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.572
But I didn't know how
or where to begin,

15:07.574 --> 15:09.440
And I was getting sick
of whining about it.

15:09.442 --> 15:13.077
So I was left with only
one last resort--

15:13.079 --> 15:14.145
Procrastination.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.915
- Stop making excuses.
- About what?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.416
- About what you wanna do
after the prom.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.251
I sense you're nervous,
and I think I know why.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.987
- I'm not nervous.
- You can't lie to me.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.255
Listen, I know
what you're thinking,

15:24.257 --> 15:26.157
And I just want you
to be comfortable.

15:26.159 --> 15:26.958
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.893
And the night comes
with a lot of pressure,

15:28.895 --> 15:30.795
And you don't have
to do anything

15:30.797 --> 15:31.896
That compromises
who you are.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.499
- Really?
Because I was getting worried.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.433
- Don't be.
- [giggles]

15:35.435 --> 15:39.037
- I'm totally cool
with you wearing a pantsuit.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.939
- Oh, go--od.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.274
- Yeah, you totally don't need
to sweat it.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.076
I'm man enough
to feel like a man

15:45.078 --> 15:47.045
Next to my woman
in pants.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.346
- Okay.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.847
- We're gonna have
a great time,

15:49.849 --> 15:55.119
Especially once we get back
to our hotel room.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.155
- Bailey.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.291
Hey.
Both: I'm sorry.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.426
- Why are you sorry?

16:01.428 --> 16:03.895
- I thought you would never
talk to me again.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.196
After I heard
all those rumors

16:05.198 --> 16:08.666
About you, and matty,
and me,

16:08.668 --> 16:11.469
I was devastated.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.303
I just want you
to know

16:12.305 --> 16:15.673
That after matty asked me
to the prom,

16:15.675 --> 16:17.976
I called you
to make sure

16:17.978 --> 16:22.847
You heard it
from me first.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.753
- I already knew.
- You knew?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.522
- Matty told me, and I just
assumed you said "yes,"

16:31.524 --> 16:33.925
Which is why
I avoided your calls.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.626
I was a lame friend
for not giving you

16:35.628 --> 16:36.661
The benefit
of the doubt.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.529
- No, I was
the lame friend

16:38.531 --> 16:40.465
Who apparently gave
the wrong signal

16:40.467 --> 16:41.499
To your ex-boyfriend.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.667
But I said "no"
right away.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.336
There was never even a moment
where I offered to go.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.940
- So you don't like matty?
- I do.

16:48.942 --> 16:52.377
He's a great guy, but...

16:52.379 --> 16:52.977
[sniffles]

16:52.979 --> 16:55.880
Jenna, you are
my only friend.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.883
And I would never, ever
do anything to hurt you.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.920
- So you turned him down
to not hurt me?

17:02.922 --> 17:03.721
- Of course.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.857
- I had been
in my own personal hell

17:05.858 --> 17:08.259
For so long
that I had stopped believing

17:08.261 --> 17:09.694
In random acts
of kindness.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.662
And there,
right in front of me,

17:11.664 --> 17:13.531
Was the greatest act
of kindness

17:13.532 --> 17:15.500
I had seen
in a long time.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.103
And thus, I was inspired
to return the favor.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.872
- Do me a solid.
- Sure.

17:20.874 --> 17:24.409
- Dry your eyes
and stay here.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.376
Eh--mm, hm.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.444
Three people
didn't have to forgo the prom

17:27.446 --> 17:32.750
If one person
could just get out of the way.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.519
So here's the deal.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.622
Bailey said "no"
to avoid hurting me.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.523
What she doesn't know

17:38.525 --> 17:41.826
Is that you asked my permission,
and I was cool with it

17:41.828 --> 17:42.460
Because I am cool.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.929
I really want you guys
to go together.

17:44.931 --> 17:50.101
Bailey,
will you go with matty?

17:50.103 --> 17:51.002
- This is weird.
- Agreed.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.603
- Again, my fault.
I'm making it weird.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.641
But it doesn't have to be
if you guys just go together.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.375
Both: I don't know.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.843
- I can easily
make this weird all day,

17:58.845 --> 18:04.015
Or you can end the pain
and just go to prom together.

18:06.618 --> 18:10.388
- I'm in
if you're in.

18:10.390 --> 18:14.559
- I'm cool with it.
I swear.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.961
- She's in.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.529
- I'm in.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.866
Thank you for asking.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.402
Both of you.

18:24.404 --> 18:29.040
Now, go.
You guys have plans to make.

18:31.977 --> 18:37.448
[slow clapping]

18:37.450 --> 18:38.116
- Bravo.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.585
That was one
stellar performance.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.652
And I've gotta hand it
to you,

18:41.654 --> 18:45.857
You pulled it off
with complete sincerity.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.225
- I was sincere.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.928
- Don't even try to bull[bleep]
a bull[bleep]er.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.597
- Go ahead.
Slaughter me.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.633
- I don't need to.
You just slaughtered yourself.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.337
And it was excruciating...

18:59.339 --> 19:00.705
Ly awesome to watch,

19:00.707 --> 19:02.907
Which is why I bet
hart's last assignment

19:02.909 --> 19:04.709
Was easy for you
to write.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.943
It appears
who you wanna be

19:05.945 --> 19:10.014
Is already
who you are--pathetic.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.417
You're welcome.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.018
- Ha.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.587
That paper wasn't easy
to write.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.624
Because there was
no paper.

19:19.626 --> 19:23.761
[bell rings]

19:23.763 --> 19:24.529
- Okay, time's up.

19:24.531 --> 19:30.234
Turn in those disastrous
diatribes, please.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.106
- Thanks for the assignment.
[sighs]

19:35.108 --> 19:36.507
I feel like I got out
some demons.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.044
- Somehow, I find that hard
to believe.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.580
- So she speaks.
- I do.

19:42.582 --> 19:46.150
- Have you finally gotten past
your hatred of me?

19:46.152 --> 19:47.785
- I don't
hate you, collin.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.021
And believe me,
I've tried.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.255
But the truth is

19:51.257 --> 19:56.260
I can't hate someone
I don't care about.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.443
- Well, that was
rather dramatic.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.045
- Sorry.
It was a waste of your time.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.948
It was garbage, phoned in,
and written last-minute.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.382
- I have eyes,
I saw you scribble that thing

20:18.384 --> 20:20.651
Like it was the grand prix
of writing over the last hour.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.221
- Just give me a zero.
- No.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.223
- I can't write the assignment.
- That's not acceptable.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.557
- Well, you're just gonna
have to accept it.

20:26.559 --> 20:31.562
- Ms. Hamilton, sometimes,
you don't get to call the shots.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.964
- I am not a brilliant writer
like you.

20:32.966 --> 20:35.666
I can't just write poetry
in a vacuum.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.401
- I never said
I wanted poetry in a vacuum.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.636
I merely asked you
to answer

20:38.638 --> 20:41.405
A simple question
that I know you can.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.241
- I can't

20:43.243 --> 20:46.644
Because I don't know
who I want to be.

20:46.646 --> 20:50.147
I ruined my life,
alienated the people in it,

20:50.149 --> 20:53.951
And now I am...

20:53.953 --> 20:57.355
- Lost?

21:00.025 --> 21:01.325
- Let me tell you
a story.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.293
So there was
this guy.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.161
He was maybe a few years older
than you.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.963
He thought
he was a tough guy.

21:05.965 --> 21:06.631
Thought he knew it all.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.033
So he sat down
and wrote a story,

21:09.035 --> 21:09.700
A killer story,

21:09.702 --> 21:11.969
And the whole
literary world agreed--

21:11.971 --> 21:12.903
This guy
knew it all.

21:12.905 --> 21:16.641
They even called him
the new salinger.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.242
So he bought
the bs.

21:18.244 --> 21:21.445
And then, he started to piss off
everybody that he cared about.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.880
He was the writer
of his own ruin

21:22.882 --> 21:24.815
Because he thought
he could do no wrong

21:24.817 --> 21:26.917
Until he wrote
his second novel.

21:26.919 --> 21:30.655
And then,
he was torn apart,

21:30.657 --> 21:34.825
Lambasted as
a one-hit wonder.

21:34.827 --> 21:35.226
[laughs]

21:35.228 --> 21:37.595
Some critics even questioned
if the same guy

21:37.597 --> 21:40.364
Wrote both books.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.566
So you know
what he did?

21:42.568 --> 21:45.636
- What?
- He quit.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.272
He gave up

21:48.274 --> 21:51.142
Because despite
knowing it all,

21:51.144 --> 21:52.510
He wasn't
a tough guy.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.244
He even changed
his name

21:53.246 --> 21:55.413
After he let the critics
destroy him.

21:55.415 --> 21:59.250
And the day he decided
to take his head out of his ass,

21:59.252 --> 22:03.054
He did the best thing
he could.

22:03.056 --> 22:05.589
- Became a teacher.
- Yes.

22:05.591 --> 22:08.159
Because he wanted to teach kids
with talent

22:08.161 --> 22:09.760
How to face criticism

22:09.762 --> 22:13.364
And discover that success
isn't about winning.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.599
It's about staying
in the game,

22:15.601 --> 22:16.834
Not quitting,

22:16.836 --> 22:20.905
Or letting someone
make you quit.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.575
Does that make sense?

22:24.577 --> 22:27.845
- So you're not a [bleep]?
- No, I'm a [bleep].

22:27.847 --> 22:30.715
But I'm a [bleep] who has
a method to his madness.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.850
And I want you to realize
that all the hardship

22:32.852 --> 22:34.652
And all the criticism
that you face

22:34.654 --> 22:38.289
Is making you
a better writer

22:38.291 --> 22:39.390
And a better person.

22:39.392 --> 22:40.858
So don't quit now
before you learn

22:40.860 --> 22:42.526
That no matter
what you do

22:42.528 --> 22:45.162
Or where you go,

22:45.164 --> 22:46.130
You can't escape yourself.

22:46.132 --> 22:50.167
- Turns out I was feeling
something for mr. Hart.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.403
But it wasn't love.

22:52.405 --> 22:52.937
It was respect.

22:52.939 --> 22:58.542
- Now take the weekend,
but turn that paper in.

23:01.179 --> 23:02.847
- Damn, tuxes are
a pretty penny.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.181
- [sighs]
how 'bout renting two?

23:04.183 --> 23:05.616
I can't believe the guy
wouldn't let me

23:05.618 --> 23:08.018
Exchange the black one
for my tamara surprise.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.787
- Well, now, you can make
the mid-prom wardrobe change

23:09.789 --> 23:10.621
You've always dreamed of.

23:10.623 --> 23:15.092
- A-ha, ha.
Oh, how you know me.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.360
- You really think that joke
is worth it?

23:16.362 --> 23:18.496
- It's not a joke.
It's a lesson.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.065
Tamara needs to learn that
she can't control everything.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.033
- Starting with you
in a clown suit.

23:23.035 --> 23:27.338
- Damn straight.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.073
- So bailey.

23:29.075 --> 23:29.907
Is this just
a date?

23:29.909 --> 23:33.310
Or is
she girlfriend material?

23:33.312 --> 23:34.812
- Mm.

23:34.814 --> 23:35.713
Too early to tell.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.515
But there's something
really cool about her.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.483
She's just less insecure
than other girls, you know?

23:39.485 --> 23:42.953
And for whatever reason,
makes me nervous.

23:42.955 --> 23:43.454
- [laughs]

23:43.456 --> 23:46.457
So you've been doing
a lot of pit sniffing?

23:46.459 --> 23:47.958
- Maybe.
[both laugh]

23:47.960 --> 23:49.527
She's the first girl
I've hung out with

23:49.529 --> 23:53.831
Who doesn't make me
miss jenna.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.799
[bleep]
- what?

23:54.801 --> 23:56.567
- Jenna asked me
to help her get a date,

23:56.569 --> 23:57.268
And I totally spaced.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.669
- Nah, don't sweat it.
It was a ploy.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.438
Jenna was trying to get you
to ask her.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.808
She wanted to go
with you.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.376
- It was
a last-ditch effort.

24:05.378 --> 24:06.710
We just figured
if we got you a ticket,

24:06.712 --> 24:08.279
You'd come
with us tonight.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.014
- And wear what?
A dress cut in half?

24:10.016 --> 24:11.916
- Or something
in your mom's closet.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.185
- Nothing in my mom's closet
is appropriate.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.854
Besides, I have to finish
my paper this weekend,

24:16.856 --> 24:18.022
And I haven't
even started.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.924
- You can do that tomorrow,
but tonight,

24:19.926 --> 24:21.158
You are gonna borrow
the perfect dress

24:21.160 --> 24:22.726
That I can't wear
and isn't returnable,

24:22.728 --> 24:23.928
'cause I had to buy
a black sack,

24:23.930 --> 24:25.830
'cause I have no idea
what color jake is wearing

24:25.832 --> 24:27.298
And I don't
wanna clash.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.500
Although I guess black
is appropriate,

24:29.502 --> 24:31.535
Seeing as I'm already
mourning the loss

24:31.537 --> 24:32.269
Of my magic night.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.972
- Don't say "magic night."
it's a cliche.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.141
I mean, explain to me
why sex is considered magic.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.709
And why does everyone have
to have it after prom?

24:38.711 --> 24:40.945
Why can't we just play
[bleep]ing mah-jongg instead?

24:40.947 --> 24:42.980
- Easy, girl.
You're at an 11.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.381
- [sighs]
you're right.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.450
I need to take it back
to a six,

24:46.452 --> 24:48.919
Especially since I have
a foolproof plan

24:48.921 --> 24:51.455
To avoid
operation: Panty drop.

24:51.457 --> 24:51.956
- Explain.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.023
- I told fred
that part of the deal

24:53.025 --> 24:55.826
Of going to prom meant having
dinner with my parents first.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.229
And once they confirm
that he has a penis--

24:58.231 --> 25:01.699
'cause he's a boy--
I'm gonna get an--

25:01.701 --> 25:02.867
Both: Early curfew.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.002
- Foolproof.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.272
[sighs]

25:16.414 --> 25:16.914
- [laughs]

25:16.916 --> 25:20.150
Everything's so delicious
and healthy.

25:20.152 --> 25:24.555
Do you steam
everything you eat?

25:24.557 --> 25:25.756
- Steam is good
for body.

25:25.758 --> 25:30.528
- Is that why you have such
a lovely figure?

25:31.763 --> 25:33.330
- Are you checking out
my mom?

25:33.332 --> 25:36.066
- What?
No.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.235
Not that you don't have
a lovely one.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.138
But that would
be inappropriate.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.108
- And yet,
you did it.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.176
- You know what's awesome
about fred?

25:46.178 --> 25:47.845
- Oh, finally.

25:47.847 --> 25:48.646
- He's not a conformist.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.015
He's an asian kid
who doesn't play an instrument,

25:51.017 --> 25:54.552
Doesn't get particularly
good grades,

25:54.554 --> 25:57.955
And he might wanna go
to art school.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.723
- [laughs]
it's--it's--it's--

25:59.725 --> 26:04.795
That is if business school
doesn't work out.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.699
- I'm gonna pass out.

26:08.701 --> 26:09.767
- That's a good sign.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.101
That means
you're getting dehydrated,

26:11.103 --> 26:14.104
And your organs are starting
to shrivel up.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.840
- Is that dangerous?
- Absolutely.

26:16.842 --> 26:20.277
But your stomach
will be flat...Er.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.712
Anyway, you're
almost there,

26:21.714 --> 26:24.615
And in 20 more minutes,
you'll finally look good

26:24.617 --> 26:25.182
In that dress.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.551
- 20 more minutes?
- Suck it up.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.486
Big girls don't cry.
- Whore.

26:29.488 --> 26:30.387
- Bitch.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.756
- I'm nervous
about tonight.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.126
I think I'm in love.
- [sighs]

26:36.128 --> 26:37.127
[bleep].

26:37.129 --> 26:38.028
Is it time
for the talk?

26:38.030 --> 26:40.798
- I'm squared away
on the birds and the bees.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.900
Thank you.
- Well, I'd hope so.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.970
But I was talking
about orgasms.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.004
Do you know
how to get one?

26:47.006 --> 26:50.040
- I'm not discussing this
with you.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.209
- I am just trying
to give you some pointers

26:52.211 --> 26:54.111
On how to avoid
first-time pain.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.280
Although, since you're
of the big-boned variety,

26:56.282 --> 26:59.249
You're probably big
downstairs too.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.784
- Jesus.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.786
- Let me--let me just show you
one technique.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.888
- Please don't.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.590
- I'm not gonna take out
my hoo-ha.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.926
I'm just gonna show you
a little trick you can do

27:08.928 --> 27:11.395
Even with your clothes on.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.230
But you gotta
stretch first.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.732
You know, warm up.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.935
- Stop, now I want to pass out
and throw up.

27:17.937 --> 27:18.936
- You're not gonna
pass out.

27:18.938 --> 27:23.307
So stop you're bitchin',
and watch me work.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.475
[pants]

27:24.477 --> 27:25.442
â™ª wow

27:25.444 --> 27:26.610
- I'm really not
feeling good.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.445
I'm light-headed.
I'm woozy.

27:28.447 --> 27:32.650
