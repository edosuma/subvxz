WEBVTT

00:26.443 --> 00:27.986
Do you have your duct tape, spaceman?

00:28.069 --> 00:29.154
- Yes, sir.
-Good!

00:29.237 --> 00:32.115
If you are hit by a Red Team BB,

00:32.198 --> 00:35.577
you will only have a couple of seconds
to patch it

00:35.660 --> 00:38.204
before the air is released from your suit,

00:38.288 --> 00:40.290
and you are marked dead
by the game master.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.876
Because there's no air on the moon, sir?

00:42.959 --> 00:43.960
That's right, son.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.712
General, if we get hit--

00:45.795 --> 00:46.963
Try not to get hit.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.675
Try to hit those Air Force boys
on the Red Team first.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.760
Yes, sir!

00:52.635 --> 00:56.806
But say I poke a hole on my suit,
like on a cactus,

00:56.890 --> 00:59.559
should I just lay down
and wait until Space Flag is over, sir?

00:59.642 --> 01:01.061
Wait, wait, laying down?

01:01.728 --> 01:03.480
What the fuck is that, "laying down"?

01:03.563 --> 01:05.440
You seem very intent on laying down.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.525
This isn't about laying down.
This is about a battle!

01:07.609 --> 01:08.860
It's just that...

01:09.736 --> 01:12.030
Sir, it's just a lot of weight,
and it's hot.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.366
"It's gonna be hot."

01:15.450 --> 01:17.494
Yeah, we're gonna be in the desert.
What else?

01:17.577 --> 01:18.912
And I'm already kinda sleepy, sir.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.413
Jesus Christ.

01:20.497 --> 01:24.000
Don't worry. In the field, each one of you
will be wearing an exoskeleton.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.835
What the fuck
is that guy's problem?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.253
Iron Man pants.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.838
You'll be paired with a scientist

01:28.922 --> 01:30.882
who can remote-control walk you
back to base,

01:30.965 --> 01:33.093
whether you're conscious or not.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.011
Permission to nap
while the pants walk us back, sir?

01:35.095 --> 01:35.929
No!

01:36.262 --> 01:38.139
No napping. Newborns nap.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.766
Come on, spaceman.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.851
The war game is very important.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.771
It will help us pick
which exoskeleton system to buy,

01:44.854 --> 01:46.272
Lockheed or Raytheon.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.233
Mr. Scientist,
which one is more comfortable?

01:48.316 --> 01:50.026
Enough! Come on, men.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.986
All you need to do is fight hard.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.238
Fight your best.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.656
And know that Dr. Mallory

01:54.739 --> 01:57.158
is getting the best equipment
for the Space Force team.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.162
-And even when hydraulics are 90% damaged,

02:01.246 --> 02:03.957
the XR-11 exoskeleton can take a lickin'

02:04.040 --> 02:05.166
and keep on tickin'.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.918
Now, what about limb movement?

02:08.336 --> 02:09.379
Texting.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.092
"Astronauts should help each other,
not shoot each other."

02:14.175 --> 02:16.052
Well, kind of missing the point.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.054
He's not a big fan of war games,

02:18.138 --> 02:21.307
but he's definitely the person
who should be deciding our tech.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.642
Spacemen!

02:23.434 --> 02:26.980
This is a great adventure
that we are embarking on today.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.440
We are training
for the worst-case scenario,

02:29.524 --> 02:33.319
but the best-case scenario
is colonizing the galaxy.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.156
Imagine, years from now,

02:36.239 --> 02:41.202
you could be on some distant star,
harvesting corn.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.287
<i>Mark.</i>

02:42.370 --> 02:43.621
Ah. Here he is.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.706
Dr. Mallory.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.750
<i>Well, I've sat through both presentations</i>

02:47.834 --> 02:50.712
and, as theater,
they make Wild Horse High School

02:50.795 --> 02:52.213
<i>look like the West End.</i>

02:52.297 --> 02:54.924
-Ha. Sorry.
<i>-</i>Which will give us the biggest edge?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.384
I'd go with Lockheed.

02:56.759 --> 02:57.802
Lockheed! Good!

02:57.886 --> 03:01.264
<i>Both are only designed</i>
<i>to get the spacesuits back to base</i>

03:01.347 --> 03:03.600
<i>after an astronaut is killed.</i>

03:03.683 --> 03:05.768
<i>Spacesuits cost millions.</i>

03:05.852 --> 03:08.271
<i>-Spacemen, rather less.</i>
<i>-</i>All right.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.397
Roger that. Over and out.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.734
<i>Neither is designed to save the men.</i>

03:12.817 --> 03:14.110
<i>-The systems are...</i>
-What am I doing?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.529
...basically high-tech body bags.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.907
<i>-But the military's ritual slaughter--</i>
<i>-</i>It's the one--

03:18.990 --> 03:20.992
-Oh, there we go.<i> </i>Okay.<i> </i>Phones.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.869
All right!

03:23.369 --> 03:25.330
Well, we have the best system.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.415
Now let's talk about tactics.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.252
General Naird sits,
sips his coffee,

03:31.336 --> 03:32.837
for perhaps it could be his last.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.963
What are you doing?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.965
I'm joining the battle as an embed.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.800
Going <i>Vice News</i> on this shit.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.136
If I see you on the battlefield,
I'll shoot you in the face.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.262
You will not see me.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.807
The hardened general keeps his distance,
unsure how to show his admiration

03:44.891 --> 03:46.559
-for this young reporter.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.436
Mm!

03:49.229 --> 03:50.647
Good, I'm glad you're here.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.943
I am going to need you by my side
all day today.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.695
You are the closest thing that I have
to a number two.

03:57.779 --> 04:01.241
So in war games,
that makes you my aide-de-camp.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.744
In real life,
that makes me totally uninterested.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.954
Five years!

04:06.037 --> 04:09.332
Five years I was Kick's aide-de-camp
at the Air Force war games.

04:09.791 --> 04:13.461
Oh, he would love nothing better
than to see me fall flat on my face.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.380
Okay. Well, then, thanks for the title

04:15.463 --> 04:19.592
of Make Believe Assistant
with No Real Power in a Fake War, I guess.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.095
So, first things first. The pre-brief.

04:22.178 --> 04:25.390
Now, the pre-brief
is sort of a stare down between boxers.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.307
Ah!

04:26.391 --> 04:30.853
Well, then my vast experience in the ring
will finally come in handy.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.230
You know...

04:32.313 --> 04:35.275
All right. I wasn't gonna
get into any of this, but...

04:35.733 --> 04:37.402
How do I put this?

04:37.485 --> 04:40.363
These guys
have a very strict code of behavior.

04:41.114 --> 04:45.702
Maybe this code is arbitrary
and excessively macho.

04:46.995 --> 04:51.249
Why do you ask to be ridiculed?

04:51.958 --> 04:55.503
Wha-- What about my behavior
invites ridicule?

04:55.586 --> 04:56.504
Well...

04:57.338 --> 04:59.674
the way you... walk.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.468
Arms... like noodles.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.553
Kind of...

05:05.680 --> 05:08.725
All right, so we're going into battle.
And you are dressed like Annie Hall.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.144
Maybe you could wear something...

05:11.227 --> 05:13.229
Uh, how do-- Okay.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.690
Maybe you could be more...

05:16.357 --> 05:17.775
Take off-- Ah. God.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.818
Um...

05:19.569 --> 05:23.156
Don't corner me
into saying something offensive, please!

05:23.239 --> 05:24.949
So, now I'm getting fashion advice

05:25.033 --> 05:27.410
from a man who's worn the same

05:27.493 --> 05:30.955
50/50 nylon-cotton twill trousers

05:31.039 --> 05:32.540
for the past 40 years?

05:32.623 --> 05:34.917
Adrian, there is power in conformity!

05:35.001 --> 05:35.918
Yeah, I get it, Mark.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.129
-You dress for defense.
-Exactly.

05:38.212 --> 05:43.301
Whereas my style is a brave expression
of my fearless personality.

05:43.384 --> 05:46.012
Isn't that ironic, Mr. Military?

05:46.095 --> 05:48.890
No, no, no, no, no. Do not-- Do not--

05:48.973 --> 05:51.642
Okay. All right. I get what you're doing.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.192
Well, well, look who it is, boys!

05:59.609 --> 06:01.569
General Mark Nerd.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.570
Clever.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.030
I suppose if I tried real hard,

06:04.113 --> 06:08.951
I could come up with a humorous spin
on your last name, General Grabaston.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.536
Dr. Mallory.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.829
Hello, General.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.873
Here to observe the exoskeletons?

06:13.956 --> 06:17.502
I'm Mark's right-hand man,
his aide-de-camp.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.712
Very progressive, Naird.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.590
This is my guy, Clarke Luffinch.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.508
Yo.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.510
His arms look like steel bricks.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.721
We're going to eat your guts, Nerd,

06:28.805 --> 06:31.224
and wipe our asses with your skin.

06:32.100 --> 06:32.975
Oh, really?

06:33.768 --> 06:37.063
We're gonna eat your guts
and wipe your asses with our skin.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.776
So the game of mental chess has begun.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.987
Hungry Hungry Hippos at best.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.079
What's going on with the lights?

06:54.372 --> 06:56.624
Sorry,
I thought it would make it more dramatic.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.836
As a representative of the Army,

06:59.919 --> 07:03.005
they are making me referee
today's Space Flag

07:03.089 --> 07:05.842
between Space Force
and Air Force Red Team.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.761
Welcome to a day of multiple challenges

07:08.845 --> 07:12.098
testing you in all areas
of space fighting readiness,

07:12.181 --> 07:15.601
culminating with a mock infantry skirmish
on the moon.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.686
Question.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.022
If we win all the events
based on science and computing,

07:20.106 --> 07:23.651
do we really need to compete
in lunar laser tag?

07:23.734 --> 07:24.735
Oh, absolutely.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.529
The skirmish is worth 100 points.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.198
The rest of the contests are worth,
I don't know, let's say 30.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.616
So, in other words,

07:30.700 --> 07:34.078
it basically boils down
to a slap fight on the moon?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.538
-It's a skirmish.
- Skirmish.

07:36.122 --> 07:40.585
Okay. The Air Force has selected
the Raytheon exoskeleton,

07:40.668 --> 07:43.880
and Space Force has chosen
the exoskeleton from Lockheed.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.797
Come on.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.466
Jim, I'm right here. I can hear you.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.468
If I may, Bert, I'm concerned about

07:48.551 --> 07:50.928
some of the physical aspects
of the competition.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.680
I bet you are.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.307
Kick's airmen are in their prime.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.600
Space Force is a new branch,

07:55.683 --> 07:58.644
consisting of mostly
very green teenage recruits

07:59.103 --> 08:02.231
and older astronauts
who spent ten years getting their PhD.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.734
Excuses are like assholes, Naird.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.737
And you are a huge excuse.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.322
May I be excused?

08:09.405 --> 08:12.074
I would like to join my scientists
for the tech events,

08:12.158 --> 08:16.496
while they pump themselves up
for Testosterone Tag.

08:17.413 --> 08:20.124
I'm sorry,
I just got distracted by Naird's shoes.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.794
My God, Naird,
how do you keep them so clean?

08:23.878 --> 08:25.630
Look how shiny they are, sir.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.132
So shiny I can see up your skirt.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.467
They're supposed to be shiny.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.927
"Mommy, they're so shiny."

08:31.010 --> 08:33.888
Shake hands.
We'll see each other on the battlefield.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.348
Cute pumps, Nerd.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.559
I love that suit.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.145
It's not a suit. It's an ensemble.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.397
-Chosen with great care and tact.
-Shh.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.860
Seems they found a chink
in your poly-blend suit of armor.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.656
I refuse to be ashamed that I enjoy
a bright, shiny pair of shoes!

08:51.739 --> 08:53.658
Oh, and Adrian, "Testosterone Tag"?

08:53.741 --> 08:56.160
No, no. Not fitting of an aide-de-camp.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.121
A title as meaningless as war itself.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.873
War is not meaningless.

09:01.749 --> 09:05.086
War is what democracies use
to protect freedom.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.964
And freedom is what allows you
to talk that sass.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.215
"Sass"?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.384
I knew you would fixate on that word.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.052
"Sass." Mm-hmm.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.099
Spacemen!

09:18.432 --> 09:19.892
Can anyone tell me what that is?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.645
Sir, that's a line, sir!

09:23.187 --> 09:24.438
-Nice.
- Negative!

09:24.522 --> 09:25.773
That is the moon.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.276
Flat, desolate, nowhere to hide.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.988
Actually,
despite its lack of tectonic plates,

09:32.071 --> 09:35.616
the moon's surface is a complex topography

09:35.700 --> 09:38.703
-of mountains and craters, among--
-Okay, okay, okay.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.746
Thank you, Bill the Science Guy.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.958
Thank you very much.
I will handle the training session.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.753
Now, once the battle begins,
we will separate into two groups.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.590
The first group
will make a wedge formation in the front,

09:50.673 --> 09:52.800
and the second group
will remain in reserve.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.552
Reserve. Called it.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.473
Dr. Mallory has also supplied us
with our firearms.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.854
This is the Daisy 760 Pumpmaster.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.814
Sir, is that a BB gun?

10:06.897 --> 10:07.773
Yes, it is!

10:07.857 --> 10:10.318
That's a Daisy.
When I was a kid, we used to use those

10:10.401 --> 10:12.236
to fight the poor kids
in the neighborhood.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.322
Now, of course, that's--
that's not PC, but...

10:14.405 --> 10:17.283
-The choice of weapons and targets

10:17.366 --> 10:18.492
was deliberate.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.120
On the moon,
the difference between life and death

10:21.203 --> 10:25.916
can be as small
as a BB-sized tear in a spacesuit.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.085
Ah. That's why we've got duct tape.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.047
Yes, spaceman, duct tape will save you.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.550
But don't worry,
these aren't the only weapons you'll have.

10:34.634 --> 10:39.138
Each spaceman
will be issued a cuticle scissor set!

10:39.597 --> 10:42.558
This will be used to pop spacesuits
at close range.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.312
-Guard these with your life.
-Can I keep one of those scissors?

10:46.395 --> 10:47.605
I'm always losing mine.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.650
These are combat scissors, soldier.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.151
Okay?

10:52.568 --> 10:56.405
Many of you may not have used
one of these for quite some time,

10:56.489 --> 10:58.616
so I'm gonna give you
a little refresher course.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.786
You gotta pump it!

11:02.995 --> 11:04.455
Pump it up! Pump it hard!

11:04.997 --> 11:07.958
The harder you pump,
the more air will be in the chamber,

11:08.793 --> 11:11.879
the more penetrating power
that BB is gonna have.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.422
Really takes a while, sir.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.051
It takes about as long
as it took the minutemen

11:17.134 --> 11:20.096
to reload their muskets
at Lexington and Concord.

11:21.013 --> 11:25.351
And... like those... great patriots,

11:25.810 --> 11:28.187
we will be operating in...

11:28.270 --> 11:29.397
Powdered wigs?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.691
...a staggered formation.

11:32.066 --> 11:35.945
Where the front line will fire,
while the back line reloads.

11:36.987 --> 11:37.905
Any questions?

11:38.322 --> 11:39.740
- And fire!

11:40.449 --> 11:41.450
Reload!

11:42.743 --> 11:43.744
Second line!

11:43.828 --> 11:44.912
-Fire!

11:45.329 --> 11:46.247
Reload!

11:47.206 --> 11:48.165
First line!

11:48.541 --> 11:49.375
Fire!

11:49.792 --> 11:51.627
Ow! You box of shit!

11:51.711 --> 11:52.753
Friendly fire.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.048
Let's hope we never face
a battalion of empty cans.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.341
You're not helping.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.300
Fire!

12:00.219 --> 12:01.971
Nice shot, Staff Sergeant.

12:02.054 --> 12:02.888
Kiki Rhodes, sir.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.015
Captain Ali,
a good staff sergeant is a treasure.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.517
-Treasure this one.
-Sir.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.562
Well, stick with me, Staff Sergeant.

12:09.645 --> 12:10.813
Follow my lead out there.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.150
Well, I'd feel better
if you would have knocked the can down.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.359
You ever been in combat?

12:15.443 --> 12:17.945
I was top of my class
in Intro to Combat Theory,

12:18.028 --> 12:20.072
and I got an A-plus
on my end-of-term paper.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.282
-Impressive.
-Thank you.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.117
I hope I live long enough to read that.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.120
I... do hope you wish
you live long enough--

12:26.203 --> 12:28.539
It was a damn good paper.
They don't just hand out A-plusses.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.418
Calculate orbital period.
What's our radial trajectory?

12:32.501 --> 12:34.879
Correcting for lunar gravitation, 707.4.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.048
You're a motherfucking math genius,
Vandeveld!

12:38.507 --> 12:39.717
Satellite's in range.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.843
Locked and loaded.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.138
Say goodbye, bitch.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.516
Boom!

12:49.185 --> 12:50.019
Come on!

12:50.436 --> 12:51.270
Yes!

12:59.904 --> 13:02.364
Come on, come on! Settle!

13:04.658 --> 13:07.411
-These are, uh, pretty bulky.
-Yeah.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.579
The suits are bulky.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.790
And how I'mma fit my fingers
through these scissor holes

13:10.873 --> 13:12.541
with these thick-ass gloves, man?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.918
The scissors. They're tiny.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.377
Tony. Yo, do you mind?

13:15.461 --> 13:19.089
Every spaceman has his role to play,
and mine is generating content.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.801
The balloons. They're bouncy.

13:21.884 --> 13:22.802
Tony.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.387
Tony! Get out of my face.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.806
Yes, ma'am. Right.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.349
-That's amazing.
-I don't--

13:29.058 --> 13:30.893
-You're dead.
-Fuck you, man.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.188
Damn it.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.109
All right!
Let's see what these suits are capable of.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.195
Chambers, give me a burpee.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.530
Not possible, sir.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.114
You can't even do a burpee in that thing?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.075
I couldn't do one before.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.284
I can do one, sir.

13:48.911 --> 13:49.745
Oh, my God!

13:49.829 --> 13:53.374
I'm sure you'll all be pleased
to hear that the science team--

13:53.457 --> 13:55.209
Da-da-da-da-da.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.169
Why did you choose the Lockheed suit?

13:57.253 --> 13:59.547
These guys
can't even move in these things.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.341
I'm sure the Air Force
is having the same problems.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.516
May I speak to you outside for a moment?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.354
Little privacy, please?

14:15.437 --> 14:16.438
Sir, yes, sir.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.482
Jesus Christ.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.570
You picked the wrong exoskeleton
on purpose, didn't you?

14:22.653 --> 14:23.487
What?

14:23.571 --> 14:24.947
You couldn't help it, huh?

14:25.489 --> 14:28.492
You hate the whole idea of war games,
Space Flag.

14:28.576 --> 14:33.122
Space should be a zone of wonder,
not of conflict and death.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.417
No, I don't think that's it at all.
I don't think it's a moral issue.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.877
I think you're scared.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.838
I think that you stink at sports,
and a long time ago,

14:40.921 --> 14:43.674
you decided that if you can't win,
you're not gonna play.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.467
What are you talking about?

14:45.551 --> 14:46.802
Oh, I can just see it now.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.179
Little nerdy Mallory
sitting in the nurse's office,

14:49.263 --> 14:50.472
pretending to have a tummy ache

14:50.556 --> 14:52.308
so he doesn't get picked last
for basketball!

14:52.808 --> 14:54.518
My father was a diplomat.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.229
I went to the American school in Geneva.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.814
We downhill skied.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.774
Oh, so you were
captain of the ski team, huh?

15:00.858 --> 15:02.610
Fuck you, Mark.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.698
<i>♪ Big girls don't cry ♪</i>

15:09.158 --> 15:13.495
<i>♪ Big girls don't cry-iy-iy ♪</i>

15:18.208 --> 15:19.585
<i>♪ They don't cry ♪</i>

15:20.127 --> 15:21.462
Sorry.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.092
I, uh, sometimes sing to relieve stress.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.261
Oh, no, no. No judgment here.

15:29.345 --> 15:33.223
When I wanna blow off steam,
I go to the tunnel under Building 5.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.851
The acoustics in there are unreal.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.312
You sing, too?

15:38.979 --> 15:42.983
No, I usually scream into the darkness
until my voice gives out.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.818
Highly cathartic.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.030
-Mm.
-So... well...

15:49.239 --> 15:50.199
hang in there.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.242
It... uh...

15:52.368 --> 15:53.661
-I don't--
-That's my hat.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.829
That's yours. Okay. Okay.

15:55.913 --> 15:56.830
Goodbye.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.082
So...

15:59.375 --> 16:00.334
All right.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.127
Don't know why I did that.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.423
Where you've been, babycakes?

16:06.507 --> 16:07.341
Working.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.593
Why didn't you return my DMs?

16:09.677 --> 16:12.346
Social media cleanse.
The internet's for trolls.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.724
Ugh. Come on.
There aren't as many trolls as people say.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.769
The existence of troll farms
hasn't been 100% proven.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.187
Oh.  No.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.399
Are you gonna order anything?
The line's kind of long.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.026
Why Erin is not being nice to Yuri?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.612
I thought we were going to have
lots and lots of babies.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.740
We can name them
after your father's mother.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.283
What was her name?

16:33.367 --> 16:34.868
-Maiden name, please.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.580
Do you even like me?
Or are you just using me to get to my dad?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.542
That hurts, actually.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.671
Yuri's love is like
sprinkles around your ice cream heart.

16:46.296 --> 16:50.342
Yuri and Erin is like Kim and Greg
from that popular American TV show,

16:50.426 --> 16:51.343
<i>Yes, Dear.</i>

16:51.885 --> 16:54.054
Makes your father so happy
the way I treat you.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.266
As happy as his first childhood pet.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.475
Which was called...

16:59.685 --> 17:00.894
What's going on here?

17:01.478 --> 17:04.148
-Uh, just getting dessert, sir.
-Before a battle?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.066
God! Why are you all so lame?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.068
-She has soft serve, sir.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.320
-Get on the trucks!
- Aw, come on!

17:10.404 --> 17:11.739
I just put my order in.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.491
Right now is when you decide
to have a backbone? Let's go!

17:16.869 --> 17:18.704
Shut up, dude. Shut up.
What is wrong with you?

17:18.787 --> 17:21.498
This ain't the third grade, ma'am.
Take your froyo like an adult.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.376
I am an adult.
As a matter of fact, I outrank you.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.295
So why don't you go ahead
and walk in front of me

17:26.378 --> 17:28.297
while I finish this, Sergeant?
That's an order.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.842
What's up, guys?
I used to be in Air Force.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.011
Hey, let me get a quick snap
with the winners, huh?

17:34.094 --> 17:35.763
Yeah, now we're talking.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.935
The science portion of Space Flag
has concluded.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.438
Congrats to...

17:45.272 --> 17:46.190
whoever won.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.317
All that matters is lunar combat.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.736
It's for 100 points.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.114
If your suit is popped, just go limp,

17:54.198 --> 17:57.367
and you'll be marched home
like a sack of manure on a pair of stilts.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.496
The mission's over for you,
but those pants fight another day.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.540
Man, we about to get BB'd up.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.000
I'd rather just get regular shot.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.710
You know how bitches
love the gunshot wounds.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.628
Whoa, whoa.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.588
Bitches don't like
to be called bitches anymore.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.632
Yeah, well,
bitches don't like a lot of things, so...

18:11.715 --> 18:13.717
You know that word originated
in the 15th century

18:13.801 --> 18:15.135
as a way to demean women

18:15.219 --> 18:17.137
who were just trying
to express their sexual desires?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.514
Why do you know that?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.308
My college gender studies professor
made me write a paper about it

18:21.391 --> 18:22.810
after I called her a bitch.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.895
-She sound like a bitch.
-Hey! Come on.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.147
But she was one, two times.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.899
-All right. Hey. All right.

18:33.695 --> 18:34.780
Hey, do you have a charger?

18:34.863 --> 18:36.698
Yeah. Charge this.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.536
Do you have a charger?

18:51.004 --> 18:51.922
Air Force ready?

18:52.339 --> 18:53.590
Hooah!

18:53.674 --> 18:54.758
Space Force ready?

18:55.884 --> 18:56.760
Uh...

18:57.719 --> 18:58.679
Yes.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.348
Let's get it on!

19:03.976 --> 19:05.227
Ho! Hooah!

19:09.523 --> 19:11.441
Here they come! Spacemen!

19:11.984 --> 19:14.486
Now is the time to prove ourselves.
Now is the time to shine!

19:14.570 --> 19:16.071
-Get off your phone!
-Okay, yeah.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.239
Pump your weapons!

19:17.614 --> 19:18.448
Pump 'em!

19:19.032 --> 19:20.534
<i>Pump 'em! Pump 'em!</i>

19:22.202 --> 19:24.079
Alpha Squad! Move out!

19:25.789 --> 19:26.874
Go, go!

19:27.416 --> 19:28.417
Move out!

19:29.710 --> 19:31.128
Go! Move out!

19:31.211 --> 19:32.296
Ow. Oh.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.714
Oldsters!

19:33.797 --> 19:35.007
Some gentle stretching!

19:35.883 --> 19:36.717
Move out!

19:38.802 --> 19:40.512
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.600
There are a hundred screens,
can't one of them be PBS?

19:44.975 --> 19:47.227
<i>You can't hide forever, Nerd!</i>

19:47.561 --> 19:48.979
<i>I'm gonna eat your liver! </i>

19:52.900 --> 19:55.402
Phew. Boy, it's a hot one today.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.362
<i> "C," let's go!</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:00.365
<i>Move out, boys!</i>
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

20:02.034 --> 20:03.493
Is this footage in slo-mo?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.377
-Come on!
-I got you, go!

20:19.051 --> 20:20.636
That's it, Space Force, cover and run.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.434
Ah, God.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.354
Man down.
Walk his combat suit back to base.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.113
Oh, shit! That was close!

20:40.197 --> 20:41.490
Ah. They're everywhere!

20:41.573 --> 20:44.076
Come on! Get up, spacemen!
Show some heart!

20:48.121 --> 20:49.581
- Go! Go!

20:49.915 --> 20:51.083
-There you go!

20:51.166 --> 20:53.168
-Yeah!
-That's the spirit, that's the--

20:53.252 --> 20:54.628
-Oh, God!
- No!

20:54.711 --> 20:57.381
- Julio! Duct tape!
- Duct tape! No!

20:57.464 --> 20:59.258
-I got you. I got you.
- Duct tape!

21:01.468 --> 21:02.302
Oh, God.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.012
-It's too late. It's too late.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.806
-God.
-Okay.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.267
- <i>I got it.</i>

21:08.892 --> 21:09.977
I'll avenge you, bro.

21:10.060 --> 21:10.978
Kick their ass!

21:12.145 --> 21:14.314
Come on, you got this, man.
Make me proud!

21:15.649 --> 21:17.567
Go, spaceman. Go, spaceman.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.861
Yeah, that's the Space Force spirit!
Attack!

21:19.945 --> 21:21.822
Yeah. Go. Go.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.490
- <i>Oh!</i>

21:23.949 --> 21:25.617
That's ugly.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.036
Captain Ali, it's up to you. Advance!

21:29.997 --> 21:31.957
Uh, don't worry.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.917
My paper was on pincer movements.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.210
Cover me, Sergeant.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.169
Okay.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.129
I got you!

21:37.504 --> 21:39.423
-Ah...
- Step up!

21:39.506 --> 21:40.632
-Step up!

21:41.800 --> 21:44.678
Yeah, baby! That's what I'm talking about!

21:44.761 --> 21:45.637
-Oh!

21:46.179 --> 21:47.889
-Damn, I'm down.
-Yeah.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.101
-Oh, really?
- Get him, Staff Sergeant!

21:53.437 --> 21:54.354
Hooah!

21:56.356 --> 21:58.233
-Yeah.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.652
- Go, go!

22:19.004 --> 22:20.130
-Oh, my God.
-Oh.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.132
You mother--

22:22.215 --> 22:23.300
-Oh.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.634
I'll go warm up the truck.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.473
Like Hitler in his bunker,
Naird has been abandoned by everyone.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.391
-Is he man enough to take his own life?

22:31.475 --> 22:32.642
That's my fault.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.561
And that is my fault,
and I apologize, right--

22:34.644 --> 22:37.147
-Okay, noncombatant! Noncombatant!

22:37.230 --> 22:38.899
Non-- Press! Press!

22:38.982 --> 22:41.651
<i>Press! Press! Press! </i>

22:42.069 --> 22:43.320
<i>What the fuck?</i>

22:52.788 --> 22:54.373
How's it going, General?

22:54.456 --> 22:55.832
Congratulations, Adrian,

22:55.916 --> 22:59.002
you made your point
by making us all look like fools.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.421
<i>Crushing the spirits of your own team.</i>

23:02.047 --> 23:04.466
My God, I even picked you first.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.510
You know what?

23:06.593 --> 23:10.764
<i>Remind me to never put myself</i>
<i>in a situation where I need your help.</i>

23:36.415 --> 23:37.332
Chan.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.420
Be ready with it.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.048
Where are you going?

23:45.132 --> 23:46.007
To war.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.386
The general needs his aide-de-camp.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.642
Dude, this is the weirdest day.

23:56.643 --> 23:57.477
Hooah!

23:58.520 --> 23:59.646
Advance!

24:02.607 --> 24:03.775
Space Force is down to two.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.035
<i>Kali Maa.</i>

24:14.536 --> 24:16.037

24:17.122 --> 24:19.541

24:26.756 --> 24:28.592

24:28.675 --> 24:31.303

-So now they have cars on the moon?
-Oh, hush.

24:52.908 --> 24:53.950
I'm here to help.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.995
Well, it's down to just me,
so you might be too late.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.372

-Yes, sir. Implementing.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.922
On my signal!

25:07.339 --> 25:08.256
Charge!

25:11.301 --> 25:12.135
What the hell?

25:12.219 --> 25:14.429
- <i>Can't move my legs, sir!</i>

25:14.513 --> 25:17.182
The system's malfunctioning.
They're all immobilized!

25:17.265 --> 25:19.017
They're not responding.

25:24.898 --> 25:25.982
Have at it.

25:26.816 --> 25:27.734
Thank you.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.244
Oh, no.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.245
Oh, my God.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.664
Don't you do it, Naird!

25:42.791 --> 25:43.750
Ha!

25:43.833 --> 25:45.377
You're still an ass!

25:45.460 --> 25:46.545
-Ah!

25:56.221 --> 25:58.431
-Space Force!

26:03.520 --> 26:04.813
No more Red Team.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.773
And the winner is Space Force!

26:06.856 --> 26:08.358
-Space Force!
-Yeah!

Yes! Yes!

26:15.657 --> 26:18.535
Yeah, bitch! Uh!

26:21.955 --> 26:22.831
Uh-huh!

26:34.551 --> 26:36.886
Everyone should be proud.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.597
You acquitted yourselves well.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.640
We got ice cream, sir.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.559
Enjoy it.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.936
That goes for all of you.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.605
Enjoy life while you can.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.774
For only the dead
have seen the end of war.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.985
We got sprinkles, sir.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.445
Jesus.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.198
Thanks for showing up today.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.367
I hope this helps wash away

26:59.451 --> 27:03.246
some of those painful childhood memories
of basketball in school.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.624
Ski memories, in my case.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.793
I'm actually rather good
at the shooting of baskets.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.128
It's just physics.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.422
Whatever helps you sleep at night.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.427
Do meet me at the gym tomorrow.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.179
I will destroy you.
