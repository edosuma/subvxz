<i>NARRATOR: This is the story
of two blind dates.</i>

00:02.567 --> 00:06.601
<i>One in 2009...</i>

00:06.601 --> 00:08.868
<i>And one seven years earlier.</i>

00:08.868 --> 00:11.367
<i>In all that time,
my dating routine</i>

00:11.367 --> 00:13.934
<i>remained more or less
the same...</i>

00:17.234 --> 00:19.133
<i>...until the fall of 2009,</i>

00:19.133 --> 00:21.901
<i>when I finally had a date
that was different.</i>

00:22.701 --> 00:25.033
<i>Because it was
exactly the same.</i>

00:25.033 --> 00:27.901
<i>I was on a blind date
with the same woman</i>

00:27.901 --> 00:30.501
<i>I went on a blind date with
seven years earlier.</i>

00:30.501 --> 00:31.334
Ted?
Ted?

00:31.334 --> 00:32.200
Jen?
Jen?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.767
It's nice to meet you.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.067
<i>And she didn't remember it.</i>

00:35.067 --> 00:36.400
<i>But then again...</i>

00:36.400 --> 00:37.701
It's nice to meet you, too.

00:37.701 --> 00:39.000
<i>Neither did I.</i>

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Do you want to...?
Yeah.

00:54.133 --> 00:56.167
Guess who just got four tickets

00:56.167 --> 00:59.167
<i>to the "Origins of Chewbacca"
Star Wars exhibit?</i>

00:59.167 --> 01:01.834
Why?
No, I said, "Guess who?"

01:01.834 --> 01:03.334
I heard you.

01:03.334 --> 01:05.167
Yeah, um, isn't it a little early 
in our relationship

01:05.167 --> 01:07.467
to do something that
would end our relationship?

01:07.467 --> 01:08.968
What? No, what are
you talking about?

01:08.968 --> 01:10.834
It can be our first
double date as couples!

01:10.834 --> 01:12.934
And plus,
it sounds awesome!

01:12.934 --> 01:14.801
Is the original Chewbacca
going to be there?

01:14.801 --> 01:17.000
Peter Mayhew, in the fur.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.968
Who's with me?

01:18.968 --> 01:20.167
Hey, do you think
they'll have

01:20.167 --> 01:21.634
Wookiee to English
dictionaries there?

01:21.634 --> 01:24.467
I mean, even just an everyday
phrase book would be helpful.

01:24.467 --> 01:25.701
We're not going

01:25.701 --> 01:28.334
to the "Origins of Chewbacca"
exhibit, Marshall.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.367
It's in Houston this year.

01:30.367 --> 01:31.400
Everyone knows that.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.300
I just wanted to get
rid of the girls.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.534
Where are you taking me, Barney?

01:35.534 --> 01:39.334
<i>This wasn't the first time
your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.</i>

01:39.334 --> 01:41.400
Wait a second.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.601
The "Origins of Chewbacca"
exhibit's in Montreal this year.

01:44.601 --> 01:46.467
Everyone knows that.

01:46.467 --> 01:48.234
Where are you taking me?

01:48.234 --> 01:49.934
My guy in the DA's office
scored us

01:49.934 --> 01:52.467
front row seats
to a lethal injection.

01:52.467 --> 01:54.734
But we're still stopping
for chili dogs first.

01:54.734 --> 01:56.067
Stop the cab.

01:56.067 --> 01:58.501
Where are you taking me?

01:59.167 --> 02:01.367
(techno dance music playing)

02:02.734 --> 02:04.501
Barney,
why are we here?

02:04.501 --> 02:06.801
Marshall, now that
Robin and I are together,

02:06.801 --> 02:08.667
I've learned a lot
about relationships

02:08.667 --> 02:10.133
by watching you and Lily.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.167
Thanks, man.

02:11.167 --> 02:12.567
You're a terrible couple.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.667
Lily has taken

02:13.667 --> 02:14.901
all the man out of you.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.501
I used to think that's just
every relationship.

02:16.501 --> 02:18.767
But what I've got with Robin
proves that you can

02:18.767 --> 02:21.934
have a girlfriend and fully
functioning male genitalia

02:21.934 --> 02:23.334
all at the same time.

02:23.334 --> 02:25.167
Okay, right.

02:25.167 --> 02:26.534
So, if Robin knew
that you were here,

02:26.534 --> 02:28.167
she would be completely
fine with it?

02:28.167 --> 02:29.434
Are you kidding?

02:29.434 --> 02:31.634
She'd sprint down here
with a purse full of singles

02:31.634 --> 02:34.267
and a poncho
for the 10:30 Jell-O show.

02:34.267 --> 02:36.667
BT-Dub, I called ahead--
it's lime.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.868
<i>Meanwhile, Jen and I were at
my favorite</i>

02:39.868 --> 02:41.200
<i>first date restaurant...</i>

02:41.200 --> 02:42.667
<i>for the second time.</i>

02:42.667 --> 02:43.901
So, Jen, what do you do?

02:43.901 --> 02:46.834
I'm between jobs--
banking crisis.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.033
I'm between jobs--
Internet bubble burst.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.434
Makes me realize I should

02:51.434 --> 02:53.133
go into something
more stable...

02:53.133 --> 02:55.133
like banking.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.501
So what about you?

02:56.501 --> 02:57.868
I'm an architect.

02:57.868 --> 02:59.067
Hopefully, one day,

02:59.067 --> 03:00.601
I can use my own humble brush

03:00.601 --> 03:04.033
on the masterpiece that is
Manhattan's skyline.

03:04.033 --> 03:06.133
I teach aritecture.

03:06.701 --> 03:10.734
Get 50% off

03:13.334 --> 03:15.467
Married!

03:15.467 --> 03:16.934
What is wrong with you?

03:16.934 --> 03:18.300
You're just looking.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.667
It's like fantasizing
about other women.

03:20.667 --> 03:21.901
It's harmless.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.901
What.

03:23.901 --> 03:26.434
Don't tell me you don't
fantasize about other women.

03:26.434 --> 03:28.267
I do!

03:28.901 --> 03:31.067
It's just not that easy.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.334
False.

03:32.334 --> 03:35.000
I once fantasized about
that silhouette chick

03:35.000 --> 03:36.868
you see on a truck's mudflaps.

03:36.868 --> 03:39.334
Took me less than a mile.

03:39.334 --> 03:41.467
Not everyone is you,
okay, Barney?

03:41.467 --> 03:43.901
Even when I do start to have
a dirty thought like that...

03:43.901 --> 03:46.934
<i>it seems so much like cheating
on Lily, that I feel guilty</i>

03:46.934 --> 03:51.033
<i>So first, I need to have
a different fantasy.</i>

03:51.033 --> 03:53.167
(hiccups)

03:58.000 --> 03:59.367
Bad news.

03:59.367 --> 04:02.100
Lily has a rare and fatal
hiccup disorder

04:02.100 --> 04:03.868
that's apparently
medical illegitimate.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.033
What?! How could this be?!

04:06.033 --> 04:07.567
Beats me, but it says it
right here

04:07.567 --> 04:10.400
on this doctor clipboard
that doctors have.

04:22.167 --> 04:25.167
It's time, baby.

04:25.167 --> 04:28.067
I will never love again.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.000
No, Marshall, you must.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.067
And after

04:31.067 --> 04:33.067
an appropriate number of years,

04:33.067 --> 04:34.901
you should
find someone else.

04:34.901 --> 04:36.133
Someone like that

04:36.133 --> 04:39.634
busty delivery girl
from that one time.

04:39.634 --> 04:43.133
And plow her like a cornfield.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.100
And so, Marshall,
to honor Lily,

04:48.100 --> 04:52.000
you must find that busty
delivery girl from that one time

04:52.000 --> 04:54.901
and plow her like a cornfield.

05:06.934 --> 05:09.167
Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.501
Where do I sign?

05:23.801 --> 05:27.734
And then watch out,
because it is on!

05:28.701 --> 05:32.000
That is the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.767
Dude, Lily gets you
in real life

05:34.767 --> 05:37.000
She has no business
in your fantasies.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.033
It's all I know, okay?

05:38.033 --> 05:39.501
I can't, I can't help it.

05:39.501 --> 05:40.501
I accept your invitation.

05:40.501 --> 05:41.567
Marshall Eriksen,

05:41.567 --> 05:42.801
from this day forward,

05:42.801 --> 05:45.200
I will be the wingman
of your mind.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.934
Now, focus on the next dancer.

05:47.934 --> 05:49.200
Put Lily completely
out of your mind.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.267
Gentlemen,

05:50.267 --> 05:52.133
say hello  J-J-J-Jasmine.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.000
Barney?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.400
Is it just me or does that
stripper look exactly like...?

06:05.400 --> 06:07.934
Ted, we found a stripper who looks
exactly like Lily!

06:07.934 --> 06:09.634
Yeah, I can't
talk right now.

06:09.634 --> 06:11.033
I'm speechless, too.

06:11.033 --> 06:13.267
Everything's as perky
as we've always imagined!

06:13.267 --> 06:14.634
Stop looking at her.

06:14.634 --> 06:15.901
Uh, look, I got to go.

06:15.901 --> 06:17.234
Take a picture.

06:17.234 --> 06:18.267
Oh, I will.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.868
But first, I'm going to
make Marshall

06:19.868 --> 06:21.567
watch as I wedge
Ulysses S. Grant

06:21.567 --> 06:23.033
between his wife's tatas.

06:23.033 --> 06:24.300
I'll kill you!

06:26.601 --> 06:27.734
Sorry about that.

06:27.734 --> 06:30.133
So, any thoughts on food?

06:32.534 --> 06:34.534
Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?

06:34.567 --> 06:36.734
I would love to share
the oysters.

06:36.734 --> 06:38.868
Good. 'Cause if you didn't...

06:38.868 --> 06:41.968
...that would be
mighty shellfish.

06:41.968 --> 06:45.267
Wow, that's bad.

06:45.267 --> 06:47.067
That's why it's funny!

06:49.868 --> 06:51.268
We've been on this date before.

06:56.067 --> 06:56.701
We've been on this

06:56.701 --> 06:58.667
exact blind date before.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.801
In this exact same restaurant.

07:01.801 --> 07:04.867
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think
that blind date went too well.

07:05.367 --> 07:06.868
Me neither.

07:06.868 --> 07:09.400
I remember thinking
that you were a little snobby.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.767
Wait, you...

07:11.767 --> 07:14.067
You dress ur cats up
in weird costumes.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.934
They're not weird.
See, you're being snobby again.

07:16.934 --> 07:18.133
Oh, my God.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.767
Do you realize what this means?

07:19.767 --> 07:23.667
Since our first date,
we've done a complete lap

07:23.667 --> 07:25.767
of all the single people
in New York

07:25.767 --> 07:28.400
only to end up back here,
with each other.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.267
Whoa.

07:30.267 --> 07:32.467
We're going to die alone,
aren't we?

07:32.467 --> 07:34.033
Well, you've got your cats.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.834
(chuckles)

07:35.834 --> 07:37.300
This is insane.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.467
Wait, I got to ask.

07:38.467 --> 07:40.067
Why did you think I was snobby?

07:41.334 --> 07:43.567
Wait... Okay...
yeah, we were

07:43.567 --> 07:45.100
sitting over there...

07:45.601 --> 07:47.400
(laughs)

07:47.400 --> 07:48.467
Main Lobster.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.567
They spelled "Maine"
without the "e."

07:50.567 --> 07:52.167
Good to know we're not
getting the crappy

07:52.167 --> 07:53.934
understudy lobsters, right?

07:54.868 --> 07:56.801
Tonight, the role of
pound-and-a-half lobster

07:56.801 --> 07:57.801
will be played by...

07:57.801 --> 07:59.000
I get it, Ted.

07:59.934 --> 08:02.167
Pointing out
spelling errors in a menu

08:02.167 --> 08:03.868
makes you seem kind of snooty.

08:03.868 --> 08:05.534
Huh.

08:05.534 --> 08:06.801
I had no idea.

08:06.801 --> 08:08.367
Okay, well, what about me?

08:08.367 --> 08:11.767
Aside from the cats,
how did I come across?

08:11.767 --> 08:13.467
That's right-- the check.

08:13.467 --> 08:14.567
The check came

08:14.567 --> 08:16.601
and, of course,
I was going to pay,

08:16.601 --> 08:19.067
but you didn't
do the check dance.

08:19.067 --> 08:22.000
(lilting orchestral
melody plays)

08:38.833 --> 08:40.200
Guys want to wave the girl off

08:40.200 --> 08:41.833
and, you know,
look like a big shot.

08:41.833 --> 08:44.467
Huh. I had no idea.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.300
This is good.
We're learning stuff.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.133
You know what we should do?

08:48.133 --> 08:49.901
We should retrace
the rest of that night

08:49.901 --> 08:52.601
and figure out what else
we do wrong on first dates.

08:52.601 --> 08:56.534
'Cause let's be honest--
we are scaring people off, Jen.

08:56.534 --> 08:58.601
We really are.

08:58.601 --> 09:00.334
Okay, I'm in.

09:00.334 --> 09:02.067
Great.
Where'd we go next?

09:02.067 --> 09:04.400
I think we went to MacLaren's.
Okay.

09:08.868 --> 09:12.734
Hey, I didn't really talk about
my cats that much, did I?

09:12.734 --> 09:14.100
And then,

09:14.100 --> 09:17.567
there's Tabby-gail Adams,
the jester of the group.

09:18.634 --> 09:21.200
Tone down the kitty talk.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.133
Check.

09:23.133 --> 09:26.200
You will not believe
who we saw tonight.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.067
Dude, um...

09:27.067 --> 09:28.634
We saw the third
doppelganger!

09:28.634 --> 09:29.968
(gasps)

09:29.968 --> 09:31.501
<i>I should explain.</i>

09:31.501 --> 09:33.667
<i>Over the years we had spotted
two strangers</i>

09:33.667 --> 09:36.367
<i>who looked exactly like
members of our group.</i>

09:37.634 --> 09:38.734
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:38.734 --> 09:40.200
<i>Lesbian Robin.</i>

09:44.467 --> 09:46.834
<i>And Moustache Marshall.</i>

09:47.601 --> 09:49.067
<i>By the following summer,</i>

09:49.067 --> 09:51.234
<i>we would find the remaining
two doppelgangers.</i>

09:51.234 --> 09:52.400
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

09:52.400 --> 09:56.667
Ladies, meet Stripper Lily.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.601
Oh!
Okay.

09:58.601 --> 10:01.067
Yeah, I couldn't get
her face in it.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.567
But she looks
just like you.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.400
So you went
to a strip club?

10:04.400 --> 10:05.868
Busted.

10:05.868 --> 10:08.434
And there was a stripper
who looked exactly like me?

10:08.434 --> 10:10.868
Okay, babe, look,
before you get mad, let me...

10:10.868 --> 10:12.601
Awesome!

10:12.601 --> 10:13.968
I bet the guys were going crazy.

10:13.968 --> 10:16.267
Oh, I bet they wanted
to touch her so bad.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.634
But all you can do is look,
unless you go

10:18.634 --> 10:20.501
into the back room, but honey,
you got to pay for that.

10:20.501 --> 10:22.300
So...

10:22.300 --> 10:24.033
Strip club.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.200
Marshall made me go.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.701
All right, so what did I do
wrong next?

10:29.701 --> 10:34.434
Let me have it.
I'here to learn.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.100
Well, I kept telling you I was cold,
but you didn't offer me your jacket.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.267
It's a little brisk
out tonight, huh?

10:39.267 --> 10:41.767
Not really.
Really?

10:41.767 --> 10:43.901
I can't feel my fingers.

10:43.901 --> 10:46.434
I'm pretty impervious
to stuff like that.

10:46.434 --> 10:48.767
I couldn't
admit I was cold.

10:48.767 --> 10:50.467
I didn't want
to seem like a wimp

10:50.467 --> 10:52.300
compared to your
action hero ex-boyfriend

10:52.300 --> 10:54.234
who you wouldn't
stop talking about.

10:54.234 --> 10:55.601
After a day
of fighting fires,

10:55.601 --> 10:57.534
Jim would love
to come home and unwind

10:57.534 --> 10:59.634
working on his
'68 Camo.

10:59.634 --> 11:00.934
That or bare-knuck boxing,

11:00.934 --> 11:03.667
which he learned
in the Marine Corps.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.501
I had an aunt
in the Coast Guard.

11:06.501 --> 11:09.801
Okay, so no talking
about the ex.

11:09.801 --> 11:12.868
Not even about his
shockingly small wiener?

11:12.868 --> 11:16.868
See? Why didn't you
lead off with that?

11:18.767 --> 11:20.434
Was there
a shower on stage?

11:20.434 --> 11:22.000
Sometimes there's
a shower on stage.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.634
I bet stripper me
would get in there

11:23.634 --> 11:26.167
with another girl
and just go bananas.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.467
See, Marshall?

11:27.467 --> 11:30.067
We got to have a bros'
night at a strip club

11:30.067 --> 11:32.200
and both of our ladies
are totally cool with it.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.434
I'm not cool with it.

11:33.434 --> 11:35.367
Because they understand
that it's healthy for us

11:35.367 --> 11:36.968
to do that
from time to time.

11:36.968 --> 11:38.100
It's disgusting.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.334
Because it's harmless.

11:39.334 --> 11:41.067
Did one of your
whores tell you that?

11:41.067 --> 11:44.868
And, Lil, Marshall shouldn't have to go
to so much trouble

11:44.868 --> 11:46.667
just to have
an innocent fantasy.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.100
Trouble?
What trouble?

11:48.100 --> 11:49.601
It's, no, it's nothing.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.033
Marshall, tell her.
We're all friends here.

11:51.033 --> 11:56.467
No, we're not.

11:56.467 --> 11:59.534
Sometimes I think about
other women.

11:59.534 --> 12:00.667
Okay, it happens

12:00.667 --> 12:03.000
But even when I do,
I feel so guilty

12:03.000 --> 12:10.033
that I-I have to imagine you...
passing away first,

12:10.033 --> 12:12.801
You're... you're
just my life, baby.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.767
And I love you.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.868
You kill me first?!

12:17.868 --> 12:20.834
I mean, fantasize about
other girls all you want,

12:20.834 --> 12:22.868
but could you maybe
not murder me?!

12:22.868 --> 12:23.634
Murder?!

12:23.634 --> 12:24.801
No! I, baby-no.

12:24.801 --> 12:26.067
You develop
a chronic illness!

12:26.067 --> 12:29.367
I spare no expense
for your care!

12:29.367 --> 12:32.200
We're, like, this close
to a cure.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.701
Remember?

12:33.701 --> 12:35.234
Oh, yeah!

12:35.234 --> 12:36.467
I do remember.

12:36.467 --> 12:38.133
We went in here for a drink
with your friends.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.000
Who I loved...
Or hated,

12:40.000 --> 12:41.634
depending on whether you're
still friends with them.

12:41.634 --> 12:43.968
You loved them.
They're family, Ted.

12:43.968 --> 12:45.667
Let's go in and see
what they remember.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.033
And they are my best friends,

12:47.033 --> 12:49.934
so don't be surprised if they
suddenly "can't think"of

12:49.934 --> 12:51.801
anything I do wrong.

12:51.801 --> 12:53.567
Did he juggle?
Bad puns?
Mmm.

12:53.567 --> 12:57.067
Expect a standing ovation
for picking up a $19 check

12:57.067 --> 13:00.100
Oh, let's not forget
the menu typo gold mine.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.634
Keep pannin'
that river, buddy.

13:01.634 --> 13:03.868
Well, it is a lot cheaper
than buying a coom.

13:03.868 --> 13:05.934
Oh!

13:05.934 --> 13:07.767
Actually you know
what it was?

13:07.767 --> 13:10.601
I remember him coming across
as kind of a player.

13:10.601 --> 13:12.067
Me?
Ted? Ted?

13:12.067 --> 13:13.267
Yeah.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.133
We were all sitting
over there...

13:17.000 --> 13:20.734
And here's a picture of my cats
dressed up like Batman villains.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.901
You got the Joker,
the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...

13:23.901 --> 13:25.100
Wh about Cat Woman?

13:25.100 --> 13:28.501
Yeah, that would've been good.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.501
Psst! Ted!

13:33.000 --> 13:34.734
Nice.

13:35.801 --> 13:39.234
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!
I member that.

13:39.234 --> 13:40.734
Psst, Ted.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.968
Nice.

13:48.968 --> 13:50.868
We were checking out
Moustache Marshall.

13:50.868 --> 13:52.467
Ah.
Ah.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.601
Gosh, I thought you
were such a jerk.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.801
I'm so sorry.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.601
Yeah, well,
it's nice to know

13:57.601 --> 13:59.701
"past me" wasn't
a total jackass, huh?

13:59.701 --> 14:02.767
"Present you"
isn't so bad, either.

14:05.634 --> 14:07.267
Thank you very much.
You got it.

14:07.267 --> 14:08.868
Yes.

14:08.868 --> 14:11.801
Oh, yeah!

14:11.801 --> 14:13.467
I remember this.

14:14.367 --> 14:16.400
...and there's the
Chrysler Building.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.234
And the Empire
State Building.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.234
And at 12:00,
a rotund couple

14:22.234 --> 14:24.000
going at it
against the glass.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.334
Aww...

14:25.334 --> 14:27.300
That's kind of sweet.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.534
Oh, look.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.701
Snack break.

14:31.367 --> 14:32.801
Good for them.

14:32.801 --> 14:35.701
Letting a guy eat pizza
off your back, that's love.

14:38.701 --> 14:40.467
So, um...

14:40.467 --> 14:43.567
I know this wasn't the best
first date of all time,

14:43.567 --> 14:46.200
but, uh, I'm glad we
stuck it out.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.801
Me, too.

14:54.868 --> 14:56.200
That was really great.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.901
Wh... What went wrong?

14:57.901 --> 15:00.234
I remember now.

15:03.734 --> 15:05.400
Wow.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.834
Yeah.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.767
So would you
maybe, um...

15:08.767 --> 15:10.367
want to go out again?

15:10.367 --> 15:12.434
Yeah, I, I would.

15:12.434 --> 15:13.501
Will you call me?

15:13.501 --> 15:14.701
Absolutely.

15:14.701 --> 15:15.934
Promise?

15:15.934 --> 15:17.834
Promise.

15:19.834 --> 15:24.567
I have been so busy.

15:24.567 --> 15:25.868
Good night, Ted.

15:34.084 --> 15:35.450
Hello?

15:35.450 --> 15:36.784
Jen, I sorry.

15:36.784 --> 15:38.450
Look, I know I'm seven years
late with this call,

15:38.450 --> 15:40.951
but I was an idiot
back then.

15:40.951 --> 15:42.517
You saw the goatee.

15:42.517 --> 15:43.851
The truth is,

15:43.851 --> 15:45.051
I had a great time tonight,

15:45.051 --> 15:46.717
and I'd love
to see you again.

15:46.717 --> 15:49.517
Ted, there are
two kinds of guys.

15:49.517 --> 15:51.650
The guys that you want
to call you, who don't;

15:51.650 --> 15:54.350
and the guys you don't want
to call you, who always do.

15:54.350 --> 15:58.017
And somehow,
right now, you're both.

15:59.951 --> 16:01.151
Baby...

16:01.151 --> 16:04.051
You should be able to fantasize 
about another woman

16:04.051 --> 16:07.550
without feeling guilty,

16:07.550 --> 16:08.884
I wish that I could,

16:08.884 --> 16:10.951
but I've been doing
this for so long,

16:10.951 --> 16:13.450
I'm all confused
about death and sex.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.483
It's gotten to
the pot where

16:14.483 --> 16:15.951
every time I drive
past a cemetery,

16:15.951 --> 16:17.517
I'm sportin' a partial.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.750
All right,
we got to fix this.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.650
Okay, when

16:22.650 --> 16:23.884
Stripper Lily gets out here,

16:23.884 --> 16:26.584
you have my permission
to fantasize about her.

16:26.584 --> 16:28.550
And since she's
basically me,

16:28.550 --> 16:30.017
maybe you won't feel guilty.

16:30.017 --> 16:32.483
Thanks, baby.
I'm-I'm so lucky I have you.

16:32.483 --> 16:33.851
And stripper you.

16:35.483 --> 16:37.383
Bring out Stripper Lily!

16:40.617 --> 16:42.417
You know, I don't
come here that much.

16:42.417 --> 16:43.917
Hey, Barney.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.684
He's the usual
and I'll send over

16:45.684 --> 16:47.684
the other usual as soon
as she's done stretching.

16:47.684 --> 16:48.684
Hmm...

16:48.684 --> 16:51.884
Thank you, kindly stranger.

16:51.884 --> 16:53.784
Ladies and gentlemen...

16:53.784 --> 16:54.884
Oh, hey, Barney.

16:54.884 --> 16:56.017
Didn't see you come in.

16:56.017 --> 16:58.383
I'll load up some
AC/DC for you, buddy.

16:58.383 --> 17:00.218
Ladies and gentlemen, please

17:00.218 --> 17:02.750
put your hands together
for Jasmine.

17:08.784 --> 17:09.983
I am hot!

17:09.983 --> 17:13.617
Ye.
Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.

17:13.617 --> 17:14.884
I is awesome.

17:14.884 --> 17:16.151
Baby, can I get another hundred?

17:16.151 --> 17:17.251
That was a hundred?

17:17.251 --> 17:19.416
Wow, she crawls fast.

17:21.117 --> 17:22.483
Look, Jen,
I wish I could

17:22.483 --> 17:25.318
go back and talk some sense
into 2002 Ted,

17:25.318 --> 17:27.251
but that guy's
a lost cause.

17:27.251 --> 17:29.483
He's 24.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.017
He thinks a little facial hair
makes him look like John Depp.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.184
And he has no idea

17:33.184 --> 17:35.184
what a great girl
he's missing out on.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.851
But I've learned a lot
since then.

17:37.851 --> 17:40.817
I've learned a lot tonight.

17:40.817 --> 17:41.917
The only thing that we've learned
is that, seven years ago,

17:41.917 --> 17:43.784
it was mistake
for us to go out.

17:43.784 --> 17:46.517
And I guess it was a mistake
for us to go out tonight.

17:46.517 --> 17:47.884
No, it wasn't.

17:47.884 --> 17:49.517
I had a great time tonight.

17:49.517 --> 17:51.917
And seven years ago,
if you think about it,

17:51.917 --> 17:53.450
we didn't miss by that much.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.550
If a couple things

17:54.550 --> 17:57.251
had gone a little bit
differently...

17:57.251 --> 17:59.417
who knows what
would have happened?

18:35.851 --> 18:37.650
Wow.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.218
Wow.

18:45.084 --> 18:47.151
You are the best.

18:47.151 --> 18:49.151
My girlfriend is
at a strip club with me

18:49.151 --> 18:50.218
and she couldn't care less.

18:50.218 --> 18:51.784
I do care, Barney.

18:51.784 --> 18:54.550
Look, we're dating now, okay?
That changes things.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.517
We have to have a serious
talk about this.

18:56.517 --> 18:58.417
Just the best.
Hey.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.184
Girlfriend trouble?

19:00.184 --> 19:02.584
I wish I could help,
but my unbelievably cool wife

19:02.584 --> 19:05.251
just bought us a private dance
with her stripper body double.

19:05.251 --> 19:07.584
So if you need me,
I'll be getting grinded

19:07.584 --> 19:09.517
like some pepper,
in the Champagne room.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.051
Just the best.

19:17.784 --> 19:20.151
... now what?

19:20.151 --> 19:22.318
I just remembered
why I didn't call you.

19:22.318 --> 19:23.450
Why?

19:23.450 --> 19:24.851
I can't believe I'm gonna

19:24.851 --> 19:27.284
screw this up again, but, um...

19:27.284 --> 19:30.584
I like finding typos in menus.

19:30.584 --> 19:31.750
What?

19:31.750 --> 19:33.617
And I know my shellfish pun is stupid

19:33.617 --> 19:34.917
but the truth ...

19:34.917 --> 19:37.584
I'm not suddenly gonna stop
making stupid jokes.

19:37.584 --> 19:40.417
Now that you mention it...

19:40.417 --> 19:43.350
I'm never going to stop
talking about my cats.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.417
They're funny and adorable

19:45.417 --> 19:48.350
and totally worth having
to take six Benadryl a day.

19:50.550 --> 19:52.884
Shouldn't we hold out

19:52.884 --> 19:56.184
for the person who doesn't just
tolerate our little quirks,

19:56.184 --> 19:58.117
but actually kind of likes them?

19:58.984 --> 20:00.784
Even if it means
finding ourselves

20:00.784 --> 20:03.784
on another blind date with each
other, seven years from now?

20:03.784 --> 20:06.584
Oh, dear God,
I hope that don't happen.

20:09.450 --> 20:14.284
Well... good luck
out there, Jen.

20:14.284 --> 20:16.784
You too, Ted.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.251
You'll find your shellfish lady.

20:24.717 --> 20:27.917
<i>And kids, when I told your
mother that shellfish joke,</i>

20:27.917 --> 20:29.284
<i>she did laugh.</i>

20:29.284 --> 20:32.184
And I swear, it was only,
like, 30% pity.

20:39.018 --> 20:40.217
Hey, Lil.

20:40.217 --> 20:42.217
Looks like, uh, Jasmine's
having a hard time

20:42.217 --> 20:43.617
getting out of those boots.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.484
What did you say, buddy?

20:46.450 --> 20:48.217
Lily?

20:48.217 --> 20:50.217
Who?

20:50.217 --> 20:53.684
Oh, yes... I am this Lily.

20:53.684 --> 20:56.450
We married long time.

20:56.450 --> 20:59.118
May I have monies for shopping?

20:59.118 --> 21:01.084
