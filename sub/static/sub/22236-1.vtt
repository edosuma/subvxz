01:02.683 --> 01:04.318
What are you doing?

01:04.319 --> 01:08.456
- It's pawpaw. It's fruit, right?
- It's for itchy crotch.

01:13.190 --> 01:15.285
That doesn't sound good.

01:15.686 --> 01:17.286
We should get moving.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.795
Come on. Now.

01:32.123 --> 01:33.988
Killer storm.

01:43.314 --> 01:44.634
Run!

01:55.482 --> 01:57.600
Faster, nerd, faster!

<i>Felix! Cut it out.</i>

02:37.550 --> 02:40.020
Hey, Oskie, want to hear
my rad new song?

02:40.021 --> 02:41.231
Sure.

02:41.512 --> 02:43.642
Felix, get your father.

02:44.287 --> 02:46.050
Get your father!

02:46.298 --> 02:48.679
- Dad!
- We need to go.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.256
I'm fine, Mum. Really,
I want to go to school.

02:51.264 --> 02:53.445
- He says he's fine.
- Well, the thermometer says differently.

02:53.446 --> 02:55.595
- Have you got the car keys?
- Where did you leave them?

02:55.596 --> 02:58.036
I don't know,
that's why I'm asking you.

02:58.051 --> 02:59.259
Here they are.

02:59.260 --> 03:02.365
You need to make your own lunch
and pack the dishwasher too.

03:02.366 --> 03:04.975
- Did you sign my permission form?
- What form?

03:04.976 --> 03:07.536
- Mum!
- Great song.

03:07.779 --> 03:11.031
Ken, can you call Dr Atkin?

03:27.804 --> 03:29.497
Can you forge my mum's signature?

03:29.498 --> 03:32.058
- Or we could just not go.
- It's compulsory.

03:32.818 --> 03:35.698
Come on, Ellen.
Forgery is your superpower.

03:35.699 --> 03:38.983
And I should be using it for
pure evil, like identity theft,

03:38.984 --> 03:41.972
- ...not some dumb bushwalk.
- It'll be fun.

03:41.973 --> 03:44.651
We'll hang out together, make cutting,
insightful observations

03:44.652 --> 03:47.944
about our fellow students,
except it will be in nature.

03:47.945 --> 03:51.818
- I hate nature.
- I arranged for us to be together.

03:52.681 --> 03:55.267
- Pen.
- Thank you.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.412
Oh, hey - want to listen
to this new song I wrote?

04:10.332 --> 04:12.733
<i>Water, fire, earth and air...</i>

04:13.144 --> 04:15.624
- That's good!
- It is, isn't it?

04:16.951 --> 04:19.151
Sarah, open up!

04:21.369 --> 04:24.089
Come on, Sarah.
I know you're in there, come on!

04:24.468 --> 04:28.524
- You're gonna be late for school.
- You're gonna be late for work.

04:28.528 --> 04:32.168
<i>You're three weeks late
with the rent again.</i>

04:32.450 --> 04:35.650
- Just duck out the back.
- Not with him at the door.

04:36.696 --> 04:40.156
<i>Sarah, I know you're in there.
I know you can hear me.</i>

04:45.090 --> 04:46.490
I'll deal with it.

04:46.539 --> 04:48.539
<i>Come on, Sarah. Seriously.</i>

04:49.934 --> 04:52.894
Don't tell the whole town
about my private business.

04:52.895 --> 04:56.483
- Is that what this is about, Phil?
- Well, no, Sarah.

04:56.484 --> 05:00.934
Why don't you hassle my ex
for the child support he owes?

05:00.988 --> 05:05.261
If Gary paid his debts, I could pay mine
and the world would be a better place.

05:05.262 --> 05:08.137
Yeah. Well, you know that
I can't get it from Gary.

05:08.138 --> 05:11.124
Welcome to my world.
Jakie?

05:13.027 --> 05:14.945
Have a good one, huh?

05:17.200 --> 05:20.600
My dad's a loser.
What can I say?

05:24.777 --> 05:26.297
Bye, Sarah.

05:26.449 --> 05:27.901
I'm not sick, Nonna!

05:27.902 --> 05:30.402
I'm sorry, Mr Bates, we just
don't think it's a good idea.

05:30.403 --> 05:31.906
Andy has so many allergies.

05:31.907 --> 05:33.683
Bush is bad place!

05:33.684 --> 05:36.706
Many poison things sting you.
You probably die.

05:36.707 --> 05:38.827
Look, behind you!

05:41.816 --> 05:43.433
Come back, you silly boy!

05:43.800 --> 05:46.360
- Catch your brother!
- Watch out!

05:46.361 --> 05:49.244
Your high-impedance filter should be
before your low-pass filter.

05:49.261 --> 05:50.621
No, it shouldn't.

05:51.636 --> 05:53.236
Dad!

05:55.974 --> 05:58.507
Mum and Nonna won't let me go
on the school excursion.

05:58.508 --> 06:01.412
And, if I don't go,
it could impact my future.

06:01.413 --> 06:03.322
I might not even
get into medicine.

06:03.323 --> 06:06.331
Tell me, how does a bushwalk
relate to medical studies?

06:06.332 --> 06:08.579
- Or law!
- Either one.

06:08.592 --> 06:12.819
Team building. Team dynamics?
Working in a team!

06:12.820 --> 06:16.795
Come on, Dad. Bear Grylls's mum
would have let him go.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.093
Oh, man, that drive was scary.

06:28.094 --> 06:31.532
- Your brother's doing very well.
- He went through a stop sign, Mum.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.773
And he nearly hit a woman
with a walking frame.

06:33.774 --> 06:35.506
I'd have got her
if she didn't move so fast.

06:35.507 --> 06:37.817
Hey, hey! Are we still
capturing our stunt?

06:37.843 --> 06:39.865
Oh, yeah, man, I should
get the camera.

06:39.866 --> 06:42.426
- Mum, I'm dedicating it to you.
- What a suck.

06:42.427 --> 06:44.107
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

06:44.108 --> 06:46.328
And, Sam, I've got a special feast
planned for tonight.

06:46.354 --> 06:48.051
- Lamb roast?
- With barbecue sauce.

06:48.052 --> 06:50.092
- Yeah...
- Sweet!

06:50.093 --> 06:53.289
- Sam, say hello to Mia.
- Ooh, Mia!

06:53.300 --> 06:55.180
See you later, suckers.

06:55.230 --> 06:57.646
Say hi, Sam...
Have a good day.

06:59.933 --> 07:01.606
Boy band's here.

07:01.607 --> 07:04.806
"Ooh, I'm so good-looking.
Everyone loves me."

07:04.832 --> 07:08.779
- He's such an air-head.
- His girlfriend is so far up herself.

07:16.013 --> 07:19.693
Good morning, bushwalkers. Ready
to leave your comfort zones?

07:19.813 --> 07:21.413
Andy, you made it.

07:21.414 --> 07:24.052
Hand me your permission slips
before you get on the bus.

07:24.053 --> 07:25.613
Thank you, Andy.

07:25.614 --> 07:29.872
Although I don't
like the look of those clouds.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.840
And he scores goal
for Bremin!

07:34.841 --> 07:37.573
- Awesome goal.
- Jack, you hit the post?

07:37.614 --> 07:39.714
Beat it, freak!

07:41.333 --> 07:45.511
Oops, sorry.
I thought it was your head.

07:47.117 --> 07:49.957
Alright, everyone on the bus.

07:53.391 --> 07:56.013
- After you, Andy.
- Bates! Favouritism.

07:56.014 --> 07:59.005
Jacob, it's 'sir' to you.
Permission slip, please.

08:00.293 --> 08:04.434
Thank you. Thank you.

08:05.629 --> 08:07.886
Sorry. Sorry!

08:11.693 --> 08:15.084
Sorry. Sorry.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.548
Is that the stink
of rotting flesh?

08:25.549 --> 08:27.799
When's the last time
you rejects had a shower?

08:27.824 --> 08:29.824
- So funny...
- Yeah.

08:37.653 --> 08:41.022
- Do you remember what day it is?
- Um...

08:43.174 --> 08:44.774
Friday?

08:45.082 --> 08:46.882
It's our anniversary.

08:47.711 --> 08:51.086
Oh, a year. Already.
Wow!

09:00.533 --> 09:04.333
It's awesome, babe.
Thank you.

09:05.933 --> 09:08.592
Hey, I'm shooting
a sponsorship video tomorrow

09:08.593 --> 09:10.350
and I'm gonna be skating
a 12-stair rail.

09:10.351 --> 09:13.229
Hey, come along and cheer.
You're gonna look great.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.496
Thanks.

09:15.497 --> 09:19.825
OK, listen up - welcome
to the year-10 science excursion,

09:19.826 --> 09:21.825
which is quite literally
a walk in the park,

09:21.826 --> 09:24.226
the Bremin Ranges National Park.

09:25.173 --> 09:28.992
In groups of four,
you will orienteer a 7km walk

09:28.993 --> 09:31.492
to a pick-up point
marked on your map.

09:31.493 --> 09:37.088
You are expected to identify flora
and, with any luck, fauna.

09:37.094 --> 09:41.852
Now... In the interests of
breaking down social barriers

09:41.853 --> 09:44.670
and as a little treat for me,
I have preselected the groups,

09:44.671 --> 09:47.367
so don't expect to be
with any of your friends.

10:30.573 --> 10:33.614
- She freaks me out.
- Who?

10:33.615 --> 10:35.495
Witch lady.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.542
Maybe she'll turn us into zombies.

10:39.543 --> 10:41.677
I think she'd starve
if she ate your brains.

10:41.678 --> 10:43.038
Funny.

10:49.453 --> 10:54.245
OK, Year-10s, form groups of four
as I call out your names.

10:54.512 --> 10:57.067
Daniel, Alexis, Tammy, Mike.

10:57.973 --> 11:01.053
Mia, Trent, Dylan and Ellen.

11:01.054 --> 11:03.401
- I thought we were together.
- He must've changed it.

11:03.402 --> 11:06.771
Next is Christian, Michelle, John
and Kathy.

11:06.772 --> 11:08.573
Join your group, Ellen.

11:08.627 --> 11:09.942
I'm not going!

11:09.943 --> 11:14.228
Then we have Jake, Sam
and they are with Andy and Felix.

11:14.229 --> 11:16.772
Brains and brawn.
Excellent choice, sir.

11:17.373 --> 11:20.172
Seriously?
Sir, are you right in the head?

11:20.173 --> 11:22.906
- No, I'm your teacher, Jake.
- Hey, brainy dude...

11:22.907 --> 11:26.084
Which leaves... Shirley,
Madeline and Brian.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.691
Come on,
let's hitchhike back to town.

11:28.692 --> 11:31.252
I heard that, Ellen,
and no, obviously.

11:31.660 --> 11:35.020
Now qne member from each team,
come and get a map and a compass.

11:35.021 --> 11:36.827
You will orienteer.

11:40.372 --> 11:41.893
- Did you get a map?
- Got it.

11:41.894 --> 11:45.332
At the third marker, lunch and
refreshment will be provided.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.026
Aim to be there by 1:30 pm
or miss out.

11:48.027 --> 11:52.621
And I expect you all to be at the fourth
and final marker by 4pm on the dot.

11:52.622 --> 11:53.894
No late-comers.

11:53.895 --> 11:57.384
Yeah. And how am I supposed to win
with these netballers?

11:57.385 --> 12:00.201
It's a team-building exercise,
Jack, it's not a race.

12:00.202 --> 12:03.468
- It's always a race.
- Let's do it.

12:21.893 --> 12:23.414
Come on.

12:24.102 --> 12:26.742
Can't you just go a little faster?

12:26.743 --> 12:29.990
I could if I wasn't carrying
twice my body weight in food.

12:29.993 --> 12:31.762
Wait up!

12:36.693 --> 12:40.212
You know this is a half-day stroll,
right, not a five-day trek.

12:40.213 --> 12:43.605
In my family,
this is travelling light.

12:47.039 --> 12:49.807
- What is this?
- Chicken's feet.

12:50.172 --> 12:52.412
Ooh, disgusting!

12:52.413 --> 12:55.571
Bear Grylls drinks liquid squizz from
a camel's stomach.

12:55.572 --> 12:57.212
What is wrong with you?

12:57.213 --> 13:00.013
- What's with the hole?
- It's a poncho, obviously...

13:00.014 --> 13:01.694
In case it gets cold.

13:02.253 --> 13:05.413
I'll poncho you to death
if Trent beats us. Get it?

13:05.414 --> 13:06.884
Sure. No poncho.

13:06.885 --> 13:09.062
Come on, we can still win.

13:12.733 --> 13:15.013
I guess we'd better humour him.

13:15.117 --> 13:19.943
- What about recording the flora?
- Trees, trees and more trees.

13:19.987 --> 13:22.795
'Eucalypts proliferate.'

13:29.114 --> 13:31.291
Yo, losers!

13:32.082 --> 13:34.162
I can't believe he beat us.

13:34.267 --> 13:38.267
Footie coach says, when you're going
through hell, keep going.

13:38.278 --> 13:40.963
That was Winston Churchill.

13:40.964 --> 13:44.132
Goths say, if you're going through
hell, stop, 'cause you've arrived.

13:44.133 --> 13:47.080
Look, Trent's beating us, and
he's got real girls on his team.

13:47.081 --> 13:48.229
I resent that.

13:48.230 --> 13:50.681
If you want to win so much,
there's a short cut.

13:50.814 --> 13:52.480
This way.

13:53.277 --> 13:56.037
Good one, Dracula.
Let's go.

13:56.392 --> 13:59.512
Maybe it's not such a good idea
to leave the path.

13:59.567 --> 14:03.294
- Can I see that map?
- Just concentrate on keeping up.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.678
- Short cut to where?
- Well, it looked like a short cut.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.726
I'M the map guy.

14:29.727 --> 14:32.965
- We should have brought a GPS.
- Nothing. We're officially nowhere.

14:32.966 --> 14:35.710
- Meaning, we're lost.
- Great. Well done, freak.

14:35.711 --> 14:37.348
We're not lost.

14:38.241 --> 14:39.721
He's slipping!

15:00.602 --> 15:02.287
Is everyone OK?

15:02.447 --> 15:05.135
- Whoa!
- Did anyone see my backpack?

15:05.136 --> 15:07.652
- Or the map?
- You lost the map?

15:07.653 --> 15:10.761
- You're the map guy!
- Totally failed there, dude.

15:11.859 --> 15:15.852
- Bear Grylls would find a river.
- Why, to get nude and eat a slug?

15:15.853 --> 15:17.655
Waterways lead to civilisation.

15:17.656 --> 15:20.596
My dad reckons that if you point
the 12 when you watch at the sun,

15:20.597 --> 15:23.157
north is halfway between
the hour hand and 12.

15:23.158 --> 15:25.642
But I guess he wasn't
wearing a digital.

15:25.665 --> 15:27.441
Come on.

15:47.848 --> 15:49.848
Cooee!

15:56.016 --> 15:57.976
Cooee!

16:01.785 --> 16:04.585
- Food break.
- Again...?

16:04.760 --> 16:07.531
- What is wrong with your metabolism?
- Guys...

16:14.402 --> 16:17.162
Come on. Let's go.

16:38.136 --> 16:40.976
Mr Bates!

16:44.810 --> 16:46.596
What time is it?

16:46.930 --> 16:49.142
- It's 4:08.
- They'll wait for us, right?

16:49.143 --> 16:50.964
There's your bag, Andy.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.785
We've been walking
in circles.

16:53.786 --> 16:55.966
Does it have any food in it?
I could eat my own arm.

16:55.967 --> 16:58.329
You know, your body
can't digest its own flesh.

16:58.330 --> 17:00.090
- I was joking.
- Oh.

17:00.172 --> 17:02.652
- They'll send a search party...
- Or a helicopter.

17:02.710 --> 17:06.063
- Hey, we're gonna be on the news!
- Bear Grylls would light a fire.

17:06.064 --> 17:09.596
Any idiot would light a fire.
Haven't you ever been camping?

17:09.597 --> 17:12.964
My family's from Singapore.
We don't camp, we shop.

17:14.824 --> 17:16.627
Mr Bates!

17:21.770 --> 17:23.210
Mr Bates!

17:24.176 --> 17:26.406
- I'm freezing.
- Yeah.

17:26.431 --> 17:28.832
I wouldn't mind a poncho
right about now.

17:29.576 --> 17:32.175
Do you think we'll starve to death
before we're rescued?

17:32.176 --> 17:35.422
Like the rugby team that
crash-landed in the Andes...?

17:36.016 --> 17:38.496
- What rugby team?
- Just... Forget I said that.

17:38.521 --> 17:40.267
Said what?

17:43.696 --> 17:48.576
It was freezing cold,
supplies were running low, and...

17:48.577 --> 17:50.219
- And?
- What?

17:50.594 --> 17:53.546
They ran out of food
and had to eat each other.

17:54.945 --> 17:56.304
A-alive...?

17:56.675 --> 18:00.137
The ones that died in the crash.
They were cannibals, not zombies.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.855
- What does human flesh taste like?
- Shut up!

18:02.856 --> 18:05.108
- Did they cook it?
- No fire.

18:05.133 --> 18:07.694
They had to eat it raw,
like sushi.

18:07.718 --> 18:11.452
- <i>Sashimi</i>. Sushi has rice.
- Oh, my Mum makes the best fried rice.

18:12.463 --> 18:14.053
What was that?

18:15.098 --> 18:18.202
Have you guys heard that story about
the giant panther living in this forest?

18:18.203 --> 18:20.646
It's totally a myth, dude.

18:23.413 --> 18:25.815
Man. Rain!

18:25.816 --> 18:27.456
- I like the rain.
- Come on!

18:27.860 --> 18:33.716
How about some music
to... just cheer us up?

18:40.136 --> 18:42.416
<i>Water, fire, earth and air.</i>

18:42.536 --> 18:44.496
<i>Water, fire, earth and air.</i>

18:44.497 --> 18:47.926
<i>Water, fire, earth and air,
elements that we all share.</i>

18:47.967 --> 18:51.973
<i>Water, wash our sins away.
Earth, guide us to a place.</i>

18:51.985 --> 18:55.916
<i>Wind brings with it fear.
Flames of fire, we must face.</i>

18:55.917 --> 18:59.504
<i>Walk upon this earth again,
walk upon this earth again.</i>

18:59.505 --> 19:02.270
<i>Walk upon this earth again.</i>

19:03.152 --> 19:07.226
<i>Walk upon this earth again,
walk upon this earth again.</i>

19:07.227 --> 19:09.787
<i>Walk upon this earth again.</i>

19:09.884 --> 19:12.331
That was supposed
to be cheerful?

19:14.316 --> 19:16.001
Great.

19:42.727 --> 19:44.567
What are you doing?

19:44.568 --> 19:48.647
- It's pawpaw. It's fruit, right?
- It's for itchy crotch!

19:53.432 --> 19:55.281
That doesn't sound good.

19:55.910 --> 19:59.278
We should get moving.
Come on.

20:12.499 --> 20:14.718
Killer storm.

20:23.719 --> 20:25.881
Run! Run!

20:36.536 --> 20:38.016
It's getting closer!

20:40.056 --> 20:42.870
Faster, nerd, faster!

20:43.214 --> 20:44.982
This way!

20:56.800 --> 21:00.109
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Don't attack us!

21:00.110 --> 21:01.929
Hang on, you're
attacking me, aren't you?

21:01.930 --> 21:04.840
- No, we're lost.
- And we're starving.

21:04.841 --> 21:07.694
And being chased.
By nature.

21:08.669 --> 21:11.178
Well, there's nothing there now.

21:14.144 --> 21:15.932
Oh, no, help yourself.

21:15.933 --> 21:19.989
- It's like, a tornado was chasing us.
- Ah... Now that IS unusual.

21:19.990 --> 21:22.306
This makes no sense whatsoever.

21:22.307 --> 21:25.412
Not everything out here
is easily explained.

21:25.413 --> 21:29.412
- Hey, what about us?
- I was literally starving to death.

21:29.413 --> 21:33.174
- Do you know what 'literally' means?
- It means you're a selfish-guts.

21:33.175 --> 21:35.013
- Sorry, dudes.
- Not to worry.

21:35.031 --> 21:37.431
The Henriettas have plenty more.

21:38.227 --> 21:40.348
Where did you find
the solar panels?

21:40.409 --> 21:45.246
Oh, I, ah, I scavenged them
from a dump.

21:45.457 --> 21:48.829
- Awesome.
- Can you tell us how to get to Bremin?

21:49.648 --> 21:52.890
Better still,
I can take you there.

22:02.131 --> 22:04.745
___

22:20.653 --> 22:22.133
Thanks, Roland.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.822
From now on, you be careful
in that forest, boys.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.440
Thanks, Roland.

22:26.506 --> 22:29.521
That thing that was
chasing us, it was weird.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.911
You're not wrong.

22:30.912 --> 22:33.532
Dreamtime stories are all about
evil spirits in the bush.

22:33.533 --> 22:34.899
That's superstition,
not science.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.721
Science doesn't explain
everything, Andy.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.362
- And superstition does?
- Stop it, you two.

22:38.363 --> 22:42.097
Not much of a reception.
Where's the cameras and the newspapers?

22:42.098 --> 22:43.978
Oh! Reception.

22:45.653 --> 22:48.973
- None. Have you guys got any?
- Must be out of credit.

22:49.492 --> 22:52.109
Does our disappearances
and miraculous reappearance

22:52.110 --> 22:53.735
seem like a bit
of a non-event to you?

22:53.736 --> 22:56.033
- Normal for me.
- Weird for me.

22:56.034 --> 22:58.474
Yeah, well, my Mum will be freaking out.

22:58.475 --> 23:01.395
So I'm out of here.
You have a good life, losers.

23:01.396 --> 23:05.716
No, we can't just separate. We just had
a classic male-bonding experience.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.283
- Brief man hug?
- No way.

23:08.651 --> 23:10.051
See you in school, then.

23:10.052 --> 23:13.445
I've never seen you or you.
I don't know you or you.

23:13.446 --> 23:16.766
Either of you talk to me,
and I'll crush you.

23:18.563 --> 23:22.036
Well, I need food.
See you, brainiac dude.

23:23.448 --> 23:25.328
Goth dude.

23:27.293 --> 23:28.932
I thought we bonded.

23:28.933 --> 23:31.623
On the upside,
we didn't resort to cannibalism.

23:31.624 --> 23:33.504
See ya.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.893
Bye, guys.

24:06.158 --> 24:07.598
Mum!

24:11.173 --> 24:15.091
Woo! And the crowd goes crazy
as he returns from the wild.

24:15.092 --> 24:17.572
- Shh! Keep it down!
- Really?

24:17.573 --> 24:19.683
Is that all you have to say?
I'm back.

24:19.684 --> 24:21.987
<i>- Back from where?
- Yeah, so we smell.</i>

24:27.533 --> 24:29.013
Viv!

24:30.367 --> 24:31.964
Hey, Oskie.

24:33.891 --> 24:37.559
- How'd it go at the doctor's?
- What doctor?

24:37.622 --> 24:42.238
- Dr Seuss, what do you think?
- What are you talking about?

24:42.693 --> 24:46.208
- Mum was pretty sure you were sick.
- Me?

24:47.125 --> 24:48.765
What's your problem?

24:50.093 --> 24:52.040
- You can stand!
- Yeah.

24:52.041 --> 24:55.575
And I can walk too.
One step, two steps.

24:55.576 --> 24:58.216
- Oscar, what happened?
- How do you know my name?

24:58.336 --> 25:02.917
Who are you?
Stay away from me, alright?

25:09.216 --> 25:13.056
- Hello? Now, you seen my mum?
- How am I supposed to know your mum?

25:13.057 --> 25:15.343
- Who's in our house?
- You're crazy.

25:15.344 --> 25:18.554
- What did you say her name was?
- She works here. Sarah.

25:18.555 --> 25:20.584
You sure she didn't
just go out somewhere?

25:20.585 --> 25:22.672
- Women do that, you know.
- What do you think happened?

25:22.673 --> 25:25.454
My theory is, while
we were lost in the bush,

25:25.455 --> 25:28.382
our families experienced
mass delusional hysteria.

25:28.383 --> 25:30.494
How good does it feel
to be home after last night?

25:30.495 --> 25:33.406
- We've only got this low-sugar stuff.
- Why is your brother walking?

25:33.407 --> 25:36.940
Oscar can walk, but my family
can't remember me.
