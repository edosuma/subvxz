09:39.146 --> 09:42.647
                 Here they come.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.950
All right.
I'll handle the meet and greet.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.117
You cover me from here.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.119
             Any problems,
             you hit the ground.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.321
                  I'll take care
                  of the rest.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.726
That's far enough, gentlemen.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.995
    Identify yourselves
    and state your business

09:56.997 --> 09:58.063
Team of snipers has you covered

09:58.065 --> 09:59.864
      so no sudden moves.

09:59.866 --> 10:03.101
    Lieutenant Mark Hammond.
    Delta Force.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.370
 Or least I was when there was
 still a Delta Force.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.005
  I'm on a mission from what's
  left of the government,

10:07.007 --> 10:08.940
     and I need your help.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.710
      What mission?
      For what government?

10:11.712 --> 10:15.013
   if anybody that gave me
   the order is still alive.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.048
   I do know it's imperative
   that I get this person

10:17.050 --> 10:19.250
to a medical lab in California.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.652
             Alive.

10:20.654 --> 10:25.824
 Well I guess I won't shoot him
 Yet.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.758
           Who is he?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.660
      Some kind of doctor?

10:28.662 --> 10:31.830
          Not exactly.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.032
      His name is Murphy.

10:34.034 --> 10:39.904
And he may just be the last best
chance to save humanity.

10:49.415 --> 10:50.949
     You got time to talk?

10:50.951 --> 10:51.849
       Come on, sweetie.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.985
  I always have time for you.
  You know that.

10:53.987 --> 10:54.885
     I just wanted to know

10:54.887 --> 10:56.988
     if you're gonna make
     it home for Christmas

10:56.990 --> 10:58.323
       like you promised?

10:58.325 --> 11:00.091
   Daisy, I just don't know.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.093
Things are pretty busy up here.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.295
 You and all your top secrets.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.364
      Can't they give you
      some time off?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.867
      Everybody's gonna be
      so disappointed.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.368
            I know.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.039
    But I'll get home soon,
    I promise.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.407
         How's Cowboy?

11:15.409 --> 11:17.175
           He's fine.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.177
      He chewed up another
      pair of your shoes.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.946
  Sometimes I think he misses
  you more than I do.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.215
      If that's possible.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.819
 Hey, did you see that stuff
 on the news about Washington?

11:27.821 --> 11:28.987
       That's crazy, huh?

11:28.989 --> 11:29.887
        (Radio)
        Northern Light.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.056
   (Radio)
   This is CDC Mount Wilson.

11:31.058 --> 11:31.956
        (Radio)
        Northern Light.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.958
(Radio)
This is CDC Mount Wilson. Over.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.127
 Mount Wilson,
 this is Northern Light. Over.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.327
   (Radio)
   The lab has been overrun.

11:37.329 --> 11:40.065
      (Radio)
      Operation Bite Mark
      abandoning location.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.734
    (Radio)
    What is the status of
    Delta-Xray-Delta? Over.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.936
      Delta-Xray location
      currently unknown.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.105
We lost contact three weeks ago.
Over.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.305
      (Radio)
      I need the status of

11:48.307 --> 11:50.241
(Unintelligible Radio)
Delta-Xray-Delta. We need to...

11:50.243 --> 11:52.041
     (Unintelligible Radio)
     new coordinates...

11:52.043 --> 11:57.315
 Mount Wilson. We did not copy.
 Repeat. We did not copy. Over.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.151
         Mount Wilson.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.187
All we need are
some basic supplies

12:37.189 --> 12:40.091
and transportation south
as far as the Tappan Zee bridge.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.092
We're meeting a new team
there, and they can take us

12:41.094 --> 12:43.027
the rest of the way to
California.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.296
           California sure is
           a hell of a long way.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.532
     The Tappan Zee bridge
     is a long way.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.201
I wouldn't ask,
but it's imperative

12:50.203 --> 12:51.870
and I am out of options.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.271
       How'd you find out
       about this place?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.306
An ex-cop and some others
taking shelter in a prison

12:55.308 --> 12:58.109
twenty clicks up the road said
there was some National Guard

12:58.111 --> 13:00.879
that set up a camp, might be
able to help us out.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.247
      "Ex" National Guard.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.082
    Yeah, I was with Georgia
    National Guard.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.276
 Warren here was activated
out of Missouri. But as

13:06.301 --> 13:08.553
far as I know, we're the
only ones left of our unit.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.889
Look. I know there's no more
chain of command,

13:10.891 --> 13:13.258
no more Guard, no more
government.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.826
Just a few of us out
there following orders

13:14.828 --> 13:17.095
cuz that's what we do.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.564
I lost eight of the best men I
ever served with

13:19.566 --> 13:21.533
getting this far.

13:21.535 --> 13:24.335
My orders are to take this
man to a lab in California,

13:24.337 --> 13:26.304
and that's what I intend to do.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.072
Now

13:28.074 --> 13:30.475
Are you people going to help me
or not?

13:30.477 --> 13:33.044
 Why is he so goddamn important?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.814
He has information vital
to the development of a vaccine

13:35.816 --> 13:37.882
for the zombie virus.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.151
And that's all I can tell you.

13:40.153 --> 13:45.056
How much more
do you need to know?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.091
 Warren and I can take the pickup
truck, bring you to the Tappan Zee.

13:47.093 --> 13:50.161
    But you'd be on your own
    after that.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.863
That's all I'm asking.

13:51.865 --> 13:56.601
 Well if we keep it moving, we can
get there and back before nightfall.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.970
I'm not sure we risk the truck.

13:58.972 --> 14:04.442
          Or you two.

14:04.444 --> 14:08.246
  Maybe I haven't been clear.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.515
     This is more important
     than your trucks.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.583
       Or anyone's life.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.853
       Including my own.

14:14.855 --> 14:18.489
I don't want to have to insist.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.593
   I was supposed to meet my
   rendezvous two days ago.

14:21.595 --> 14:22.894
     This needs to happen.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.863
              Now.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.203
            Listen.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.106
   If they're trying to steal
   the truck,

14:35.108 --> 14:36.040
     do what you got to do.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.442
 Always.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.447
     Stay in radio contact.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.616
   We don't hear from you by
   tomorrow morning,

14:44.618 --> 14:45.816
      we'll come lookin'.

14:45.818 --> 14:50.420
     You'll have them back
     by sundown.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.135
Well if availability of ammo is
all you care about

15:04.137 --> 15:05.503
 then the .22 is the way to go.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.305
 But... You really want to make
 an impression,

15:07.307 --> 15:10.975
  check out this smoke wagon.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.044
   You really make a z's day
   with this.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.345
 Now the .22, that'll kill a z,

15:14.347 --> 15:15.914
    but it's gonna be about
    two or three shots

15:15.916 --> 15:17.282
       before the thing's
       down and dead.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.416
           This baby?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.285
   You stop a car with this.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.054
     I was thinking
     something more silent.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.222
          Like a club.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.423
           And sharp.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.058
       Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.260
  Yeah, I like how you think.
  Silent but effective.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.197
           Huh? Okay.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.434
        Check this out.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.402
                           Hmmm.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.436
        Made it myself.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.038
   I call it "The Z Whacker."

15:40.040 --> 15:41.438
        You start with
        an aluminium bat

15:41.440 --> 15:43.608
     then customize it
     for the task at hand.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.076
        Wow. It's light.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.445
 Yeah, the spikes are hand cast
 from beer cans.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.245
    So they're long enough
    that they kill the brain

15:49.247 --> 15:52.116
 but you can still pull it out.
 Cuz nothing is worse than

15:52.118 --> 15:54.352
    getting your pike stuck
    into a z's skull.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.720
 Cuz then you got to drag them
 down to the ground.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.055
    You got to put your foot
    on their chest.

15:57.057 --> 15:57.989
      Then you got to
      yank the thing out.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.157
    And by then you're dead.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.224
     You know what I mean?

16:00.226 --> 16:02.727
              Sure do hate that.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.696
     How 'bout a
     straight across trade?

16:04.698 --> 16:06.197
    A dozen of these aspirin

16:06.199 --> 16:08.366
      for a dozen of these
      reloaded .223's.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.301
    You can't kill a zombie
    with aspirin.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.103
  Well you can't kill a fever
  with a bullet

16:12.105 --> 16:14.005
     and they ain't making
     any more aspirin.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.540
   Make it a dozen oxycontin
   and you got a deal.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.976
       I'd have to take
       a dozen oxycontin

16:17.978 --> 16:19.544
   before I'd make that deal.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.712
      How 'bout some meth?

16:20.714 --> 16:22.580
  Huh? You want some crystal?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.615
    Yeah, I baked it myself.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.515
  That same pink ice you made
  before?

16:25.517 --> 16:28.186
 No, that stuff gave me
 an axe to the skull headache.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.721
 No,
 that's what the aspirin's for.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.656
  How many ampules of morphine
  you got left in there?

16:31.658 --> 16:32.991
       [zombie growling]

16:32.993 --> 16:33.591
          Behind you.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.626
       [zombie growling]

16:38.330 --> 16:42.033
Nice. You all right?
That was a little close.

16:42.035 --> 16:45.203
            Yeah, that...
            that was a fast one.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.204
                         Brutal.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.072
            Told ya.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.507
  Hey, isn't that Red Hanson?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.109
          Z's got Red?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.677
      Damn, he was one of
      our best customers

16:52.679 --> 16:54.178
       Tough as bullets.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.480
 I wonder if his brothers know.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.080
       [zombie growling]

16:56.082 --> 16:58.282
      Yeah, I think so
      cuz here they come.

16:58.284 --> 16:58.783
       [zombie growling]

16:58.785 --> 17:00.118

17:13.233 --> 17:14.632
         [two gunshots]

17:18.737 --> 17:20.471
Closing time.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.118
   The way that big one moved

17:34.120 --> 17:37.488
 he must have turned just a few
 hours ago.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.057
Four brothers, recently turned,

17:39.059 --> 17:41.726
   found on Miller's Road by
   Sutter's Farm.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.762
         Given mercy,
         May 13, 3 A.Z.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.164
                     Time to go.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.071
      I got something over here.

17:54.673 --> 17:57.241
Looks like a floater washed up.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.478
    I got another one over here.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.282
             This one looks dead
             and down too.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.153
            Donner.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.389
             Look.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.858
   Must be hundreds of them.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.795
        Ferry accident?

18:23.469 --> 18:31.275
[zombies growling and screaming]

18:31.877 --> 18:33.711
      Camp Blue Sky,
      this is mobile one.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.747
   Blue Sky,
   this is mobile one. Over.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.883
 Hey guys,
 I need you to get back to us.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.252
    It's time for our 8 p.m.
    signal check.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.520
 What are you wasting time for?

18:42.522 --> 18:43.754
       You said yourself
       they'd be fine.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.690
      Look, there must be
      something wrong.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.226
If we don't hear from them soon,
we're gonna have to go back.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.428
     I don't think I can let you
     do that.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.230
     If something is wrong
     with my people

18:52.232 --> 18:53.798
      I don't give a damn
      about your mission.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.233
            Or you.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.234
       We're going back.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.736
             Look.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.906
  I appreciate your loyalty to
  those folks. I do.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.208
 But you don't know what I know
 about this man.

19:04.210 --> 19:08.179
     Why should we believe
     a word you say?

19:08.181 --> 19:10.214
      Get out of the car.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.352
           Show them.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.420
   Show them why
   you're so damn important.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.620
          Get your hands off me.

19:17.622 --> 19:19.157
     Show them why so many
     good men died

19:19.159 --> 19:20.158
     getting you this far.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.259
Show them!

19:33.672 --> 19:36.908
         What happened?

19:36.910 --> 19:38.776
    Those are Zombie bites.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.778
    Eight of them.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.846
     Why is he still alive?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.781
       And not a zombie?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.516
              Hey.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.685
He was given the only dose of an
experimental vaccine

19:47.687 --> 19:49.787
  right before he was bitten.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.857
Those undead bastards got two of
my ribs right there.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.757
            Shut up.

19:53.759 --> 19:54.759
  At least you're still alive.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.894
More than I can say for my men.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.963
You're looking at the only human
known to have survived

19:58.965 --> 20:00.898
   being bitten by a Zombie.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.868
His blood carries the antibodies
for the ZN1 virus.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.937
    If we can get him
    to the lab in California

20:05.939 --> 20:09.240
 they can use his blood
 and make more of the vaccine.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.942
    (Radio)
    Mayday. Mayday. Calling
    Camp Blue Sky.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.910

   This is Doc.
   With Thompson and Carver.

20:12.912 --> 20:13.910
 (Radio)
 What is your situation? Over.

20:13.912 --> 20:16.781
   Hey, Doc. What's going on?
   What's going on?

20:16.783 --> 20:18.282
Garnett? Thank God you're alive.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.650
 We thought everyone was dead.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.652
   I'm not at Camp Blue Sky.
   What's happening?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.887
     (unintelligible radio)
     Batteries... dying.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.854
       Wait. Say. Again.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.824
          [explosion]

20:26.826 --> 20:29.293
   (Radio)
   Blue Sky has been overrun.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.495
 The whole place is...on fire.

20:31.497 --> 20:37.235
 (Radio) Survivors? Well there was a ton
of gunfire a while ago, but nothing since.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.436
       Come on. Let's go.

20:52.484 --> 20:56.621
 [heavy breathing]
 Oh... There's the escape bus.

20:56.623 --> 21:00.024
[heavy breathing]
Oh, they got the kids out. Okay.

21:00.026 --> 21:04.395
       [zombies growling]

21:04.397 --> 21:05.930
       [heavy breathing]
       Come on.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.703
            [crash]

21:15.407 --> 21:25.449
 [zombies growling and yelling]

        [vehicle engine]

21:46.939 --> 21:47.972
            Get in!

21:54.613 --> 21:56.080
        [screams]
        Go! Go! Go! Go!

21:56.082 --> 21:56.847
[zombies growling and screaming]

21:56.849 --> 21:59.050
         [two gunshots]

21:59.052 --> 22:02.320
[zombies growling and screaming]

22:02.621 --> 22:03.587
         How many more?

22:03.589 --> 22:04.388
            Nobody.

22:04.390 --> 22:04.922
            Nobody?!

22:04.924 --> 22:05.823
       Nobody! I'm sure!

22:05.825 --> 22:06.691
         Donna? Marion?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.359
     No...there was no one.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.394
     Not even time to show
     any of them mercy.

22:10.396 --> 22:13.664
 There's nobody back there
 but z's. Sorry guys. We tried.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.100
Nothing left for them now but
God's mercy.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.902
           It's time to go then.
           Come on.

22:27.813 --> 22:29.947
    I don't know what we brought
    them along for.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.382
      Uh...because they're
      human beings

22:31.384 --> 22:33.384
   and they deserve to live.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.919
    Hey... how much further
    to this rendezvous?

22:34.921 --> 22:36.654
    Just a few more clicks.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.723
 Got some vehicles
 and a team of killers waiting.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.958
   Wish I had ten times that.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.158
Should be up ahead on the left.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.962
An old high school with a civil
defense shelter in the basement.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.765
    Supposedly there's still
    some rations left there.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.967
  When was the last time
  you made contact with them?

22:49.969 --> 22:51.836
       About a month ago.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.404
          A month ago?

22:53.406 --> 22:57.508
     That's like two years
     Apocalypse time.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.857
     Get back in the truck.

23:22.667 --> 23:23.734
                    <i> Is it them?</i>

23:24.803 --> 23:25.703
           Hammond?!

23:25.705 --> 23:27.004
          Is it them?!

23:27.006 --> 23:36.547
           <i> [growling]</i>

23:36.549 --> 23:37.581

23:38.418 --> 23:39.483
             [thud]

23:40.919 --> 23:43.053
         I got to pee.

23:47.726 --> 23:49.026
         Don't go far.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.729
          Don't worry.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.031
         [under breath]
         This guy.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.934
  My reinforcements are dead.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.905
We need to make a quick search
for survivors and any supplies.

24:00.907 --> 24:01.872
              You!

24:02.941 --> 24:06.777
Zip it up and stay close to me.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.845
  Hey, where'd all the z's go?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.780
Movin' on, like locust.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.682
   Yeah, but they'll be back.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.752
    Garnett and Warren,
    you clear the building.

24:14.754 --> 24:18.122
      And you three check
      the vehicles.

24:23.094 --> 24:24.695
             Looks like they
             never had a chance.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.596

There.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.661

24:58.564 --> 24:59.230
             Dead.

24:59.232 --> 25:02.867
Turned? Looks like she
took a blow to the skull.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.802
     Brain dead on impact.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.238

          Whoa.
          It's a real live baby.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.053

     in years.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.523

25:25.525 --> 25:26.290
                   Here.
                   What do I do?

25:26.292 --> 25:26.957
Maybe don't

25:26.959 --> 25:27.857
                           Okay.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.528
Hold him like he's a live
grenade. Just give him to me.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.997
     Me and babies, not so much.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
    What was she doing
    out here with a baby anyway?

25:35.001 --> 25:35.599
I dunno.

25:35.601 --> 25:36.899
Looks like they were
headed to this shelter.

25:36.901 --> 25:40.271
They got overrun.

25:40.273 --> 25:43.107
   What the hell are we gonna do
   with a baby?

25:43.109 --> 25:47.144
Beats me. I stopped planning two
minutes ahead years ago.

 [zombies growling and yelling]

25:52.018 --> 25:52.950
           Heads up.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.251
      What are they after?

25:54.253 --> 25:56.554
    Only one thing. Come on.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.643
                  You all right?

26:26.284 --> 26:26.984
Careful.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.852
She might be dead.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.260
Whoa. Whoa.

Hey. It's okay.

Hey. It's okay.
We're good people.

26:43.065 --> 26:43.666
We just saved you.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.234
Okay, don't hurt him.

26:51.876 --> 26:55.379
   Sorry.
   I didn't know where I was.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.247
   I must have fallen asleep.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.983

26:58.985 --> 27:01.118
               How long you
               in this cage for?

27:03.688 --> 27:05.322
           Two days.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.135
Somebody better shut that kid up
before he attracts z's like flies.

27:18.137 --> 27:22.936
 Hey. It's a baby. He makes noise, okay?
Shut up. And you, do what you can.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.908
   He's right about the z's.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.310
Here.

27:31.716 --> 27:32.916
Hey.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.085
       Why would somebody
       lock you in a cage

27:35.087 --> 27:36.286
     and leave you to die?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.155
        What did you do?

27:38.157 --> 27:40.257
     I didn't do anything.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.292
  I locked myself in the cage
  for protection.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.661
       You have the keys?

27:44.929 --> 27:46.664
          I lost them.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.167
       Why are you
       dressed like that?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.769
                 I don't have to
                 justify myself.

27:51.771 --> 27:57.408
 Maybe you do! We were supposed to
meet the men in those vehicles.

27:57.410 --> 27:58.842
      What happened here?

27:58.844 --> 28:01.045
             Those men showed up
             about a week ago.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.347
 They cleared out the school and
 set up some kind of camp.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.282
            But word got out
            that there was food.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.385
               Lots of it from
               the bomb shelter.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.388
      Yeah, it didn't take long.
      There was too many people.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.157
   The soldiers shot some of the
   locals,

28:13.159 --> 28:16.093
       and that brought the z's.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.762
 You can guess the rest. What are
we wasting time talking to her for?

28:18.764 --> 28:21.065
       Give her the baby,
       and let's go.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.933
You can't give this girl a baby
and leave.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.468
   Well they can't come with us.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.368
            Listen.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.772
No way am I leaving the baby
and her behind.

28:28.774 --> 28:30.207
It's not gonna happen.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.242
               It's just a baby.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.179
It's not like he's gonna grow up
and be a fine young man someday.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.948
    You know what, shut up!

28:37.950 --> 28:40.184
     We'll take them to
     the next safe outpost.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.885

    <i> I can see you.</i>

      <i> Running. Hiding.</i>
      <i> Killing. Surviving.</i>

41:17.641 --> 41:19.075
       I've seen it all.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.679
      Season tickets
      to the Zompocalypse.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.080
 And I got to tell you people,

41:24.082 --> 41:26.950
       we've been getting
       our asses kicked.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.719
     Well today's the day
     that all that changes.

41:31.722 --> 41:34.057
 That's right.
 I'm not just watching anymore.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.826
     It's time to
     kick some zombie ass.

 vhf, uhf, skynet.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.800
    If you can get a signal,
    then you can find me

41:43.802 --> 41:46.202
     thanks to our friends
     at the NSA.

41:46.204 --> 41:50.507
  Now all I need is somebody,
  anybody, everybody
  to get back to me

41:50.509 --> 41:52.742
   cuz that's how it starts.
   If you're still alive,

41:52.744 --> 41:56.246
you're probably some
kind of...some kind of
genetically predisposed badass.

41:56.248 --> 42:00.817
 And all we got to do is
 get organized and the zombies
 don't stand a chance.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.686
 Now here's a little something
 for all of you out there

42:03.688 --> 42:08.124
  with 3,000 miles of bad road
  between you and home.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.293
    I hope you can hear it.
