00:21.603 --> 00:23.141
You're cooking.

00:23.142 --> 00:25.417
This must be a dream or perhaps

00:25.418 --> 00:26.589
a nightmare.

00:26.590 --> 00:28.127
I choose to take
the higher ground

00:28.128 --> 00:29.100
and ignore that.

00:29.101 --> 00:30.404
Breakfast is served.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.213
These are my patented
special pancakes

00:32.214 --> 00:34.086
that I make for Alexis.

00:34.087 --> 00:35.357
Well, not so special.

00:35.358 --> 00:37.433
I learned how to prepare it
for her this past year.

00:37.434 --> 00:38.705
Oh.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.281
So the student becomes...

00:41.282 --> 00:43.391
the failed student,

00:43.392 --> 00:45.164
the dropout.

00:45.165 --> 00:46.570
You fed her this?
Mother...

00:46.571 --> 00:48.845
you are forever forbidden

00:48.846 --> 00:51.289
from practicing the art
of pan-Cake-Do.

00:51.290 --> 00:52.261
Where did I go wrong?

00:52.262 --> 00:53.732
Where do I begin?

00:53.733 --> 00:55.173
But Alexis isn't even here.
Why are you making these?

00:57.382 --> 00:58.686
You miss her.

00:58.687 --> 01:00.794
Ohh.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.433
Well, don't you?

01:02.434 --> 01:03.941
Yes, of course I do.

01:03.942 --> 01:06.383
But Columbia's just
a cab ride away.

01:06.384 --> 01:09.229
Oh, she was the center
of our lives for so long,

01:09.230 --> 01:12.173
and now she's just...
gone?

01:12.174 --> 01:14.785
Right now is just Alexis' time

01:14.786 --> 01:17.261
to make her own way
in the world.

01:17.262 --> 01:19.337
But she'll be back.

01:20.976 --> 01:22.650
Like Simba in "The Lion King,"

01:22.651 --> 01:24.524
it's the circle of life.

01:24.525 --> 01:26.398
Oh, Darling.

01:26.399 --> 01:27.903
You seem to have adopted

01:27.904 --> 01:29.577
a real zen-Like attitude
about all this, Castle.

01:29.578 --> 01:31.587
Well, I realized I've been
a little overprotective

01:31.588 --> 01:33.293
of Alexis at times.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.267
Okay, constantly.

01:35.268 --> 01:36.608
But since she's left
for Columbia,

01:36.609 --> 01:38.045
I've learned to let go.

01:38.046 --> 01:40.053
I've stopped checking
her video blog.

01:40.054 --> 01:42.797
I don't ask to meet
her boyfriend anymore.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.472
I've come to realize that,
like a bird,

01:44.473 --> 01:46.312
Alexis needed
to leave the nest.

01:46.313 --> 01:47.818
So I let her fly...

01:47.819 --> 01:49.323
I turned around
and I Strode away.

01:49.324 --> 01:50.598
That's acceptance.

01:50.599 --> 01:53.374
But wouldn't acceptance be
letting her go,

01:53.375 --> 01:56.085
seeing where she flies,
and then being okay with it?

01:56.086 --> 01:57.423
Yeah, but I wouldn't be
okay with that.

01:57.424 --> 01:58.761
I don't want
to see where she goes,

01:58.762 --> 02:00.738
what other birds of prey
are out there

02:00.739 --> 02:02.344
and what other nests are...

02:02.345 --> 02:04.485
So is that acceptance
or denial?

02:04.486 --> 02:05.689
Well, it was acceptance

02:05.690 --> 02:07.131
till you started applying
your fiendish logic.

02:07.132 --> 02:10.644
How about you guys apply
some fiendish logic to this?

02:10.645 --> 02:12.117
Meet Hasim Farouk.

02:12.118 --> 02:14.694
Man versus van
at 1:00 A.M. Last night.

02:14.695 --> 02:16.133
He was killed instantly.

02:16.134 --> 02:17.840
Knocked right out of his shoes

02:17.841 --> 02:19.111
at the point of impact.

02:19.112 --> 02:20.483
So a hit and run.

02:20.484 --> 02:21.621
Well, that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

02:21.622 --> 02:23.060
A witness, homeless guy,
said that

02:23.061 --> 02:24.533
the victim emptied his gun
at the van

02:24.534 --> 02:25.805
and just stood in the middle
of the street shooting

02:25.806 --> 02:26.978
right until it hit him.

02:26.979 --> 02:28.416
Why would he do that?

02:28.417 --> 02:29.654
I don't know.

02:29.655 --> 02:30.827
But he definitely knew
his way around guns. Janey.

02:30.828 --> 02:32.834
This is a Sig P-220-S

02:32.835 --> 02:34.675
with a weight compensator,

02:34.676 --> 02:36.484
target sights,
and a custom-molded grip

02:36.485 --> 02:37.653
to his hand.

02:37.654 --> 02:38.824
This was a serious shooter.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.995
What else do we know about him?

02:39.996 --> 02:41.704
Well, Hasim Farouk
is a Saudi national

02:41.705 --> 02:43.511
living here as a student.

02:43.512 --> 02:45.084
Majoring in what,
urban warfare?

02:45.085 --> 02:46.992
Uh, undeclared, actually,
up at Columbia.

02:46.993 --> 02:49.167
So what was he doing
in lower Manhattan?

02:49.168 --> 02:50.539
More importantly...

02:50.540 --> 02:51.678
What is Columbia doing

02:51.679 --> 02:53.184
admitting gun-toting
lunatics

02:53.185 --> 02:55.693
and are there any more of them?

02:57.201 --> 02:58.974
For the record, I'm not
calling to check on Alexis.

02:58.975 --> 03:01.048
I'm just checking my e-Mail.

03:02.556 --> 03:03.592
Acceptance.

03:03.593 --> 03:05.600
Have tech search
traffic cam footage

03:05.601 --> 03:07.541
for any video of that van,

03:07.542 --> 03:09.015
and let's look into
Hasim Farouk's life.

03:09.016 --> 03:10.621
See if he had any enemies.

03:10.622 --> 03:12.561
Well, it looks like
he had at least one.

03:12.562 --> 03:14.839
Assault charges were filed
against him two days ago

03:14.840 --> 03:16.343
by one Bram Stoker.

03:16.344 --> 03:19.323
Bram Stoker, author of
"Dracula," died in 1912?

03:19.324 --> 03:22.836
Uh, if it's him,
I'd say he's immortal.

03:22.837 --> 03:24.711
Excuse me.
Bram Stoker?

03:24.712 --> 03:25.883
Yeah.

03:25.884 --> 03:27.589
Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

03:27.590 --> 03:30.067
And might I say
how youthful you look?

03:30.068 --> 03:32.041
Witty.
Never heard that before.

03:32.042 --> 03:34.251
I've never heard of anyone
named Bram Stoker before

03:34.252 --> 03:36.091
except Bram Stoker.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.696
Apparently,
he's a distant relative,

03:37.697 --> 03:39.204
and both my parents
are English scholars.

03:39.205 --> 03:40.744
They thought it'd be cute.

03:40.745 --> 03:42.182
It wasn't.

03:42.183 --> 03:44.290
So what is this about?

03:44.291 --> 03:45.430
The late Hasim Farouk.

03:45.431 --> 03:46.968
The late?

03:46.969 --> 03:48.139
He's dead?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.045
Yes, he was murdered
the day after you filed

03:50.046 --> 03:51.251
an assault charge against him.

03:51.252 --> 03:52.388
Well, I certainly
did not kill him.

03:52.389 --> 03:54.366
I filed those charges
to protect myself.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.938
From what?

03:55.939 --> 03:57.845
Hasim was a student of mine.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.887
I'm a T.A. For a seminar
on Joyce.

03:59.888 --> 04:01.726
What was the problem
with the two of you?

04:01.727 --> 04:03.333
I didn't think that
there was one.

04:03.334 --> 04:04.406
And then three days ago,

04:04.407 --> 04:06.279
he confronts me after class.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.785
Starts accusing me

04:07.786 --> 04:09.024
of being...

04:09.025 --> 04:12.170
overly familiar
with some female students.

04:12.171 --> 04:13.743
Said if I didn't stop,

04:13.744 --> 04:14.515
he'd kill me.

04:14.516 --> 04:16.185
For harassing those women?

04:16.187 --> 04:18.195
No, I was not harassing them.

04:18.196 --> 04:20.803
I... I might flirt

04:20.805 --> 04:22.847
with students on occasion.

04:22.848 --> 04:25.022
But believe me,
it was never unwelcome.

04:25.023 --> 04:28.135
Ladies are kind of digging
on vampires right now.

04:28.136 --> 04:29.540
My name is Bram Stoker.

04:29.541 --> 04:31.416
For once in my life,
it's working for me.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.524
Maybe Hasim was jealous.

04:33.525 --> 04:35.330
Were any of those students
his girlfriend?

04:35.331 --> 04:37.271
No, I-I don't think
he had a girlfriend

04:37.272 --> 04:38.911
or friends at all,
for that matter.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.452
Okay, well, I'm gonna need
a list of all the girls

04:40.453 --> 04:41.958
that you flirted with.

04:43.131 --> 04:45.271
Look at this building.

04:45.272 --> 04:47.245
Hasim was living large
for a college student.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.920
Yeah, add that
to the list of things

04:48.921 --> 04:51.329
about this dude
that don't add up.

04:51.330 --> 04:53.136
His records say he started
as a freshman at 24.

04:53.137 --> 04:54.407
Now who does that?

04:54.408 --> 04:55.580
A late Bloomer.

04:55.581 --> 04:57.889
Or a Sleeper-Cell terrorist.

04:57.890 --> 04:58.958
Think about it.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.130
Saudi national,

05:00.131 --> 05:01.672
he shot up a van
with a customized Sig.

05:01.673 --> 05:03.511
I'm just saying...

05:03.512 --> 05:04.884
could be a terrorist.

05:04.885 --> 05:05.654
Whoa.

05:05.655 --> 05:08.164
Whoa.

05:08.165 --> 05:10.407
Look at all this gear.

05:10.408 --> 05:12.648
This guy practically has
his own dojo.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.727
Uh... Yeah,

05:23.728 --> 05:26.705
and if his black-Belt skills
didn't get it done,

05:26.706 --> 05:28.412
he always had this.
Wow.

05:28.413 --> 05:30.420
That's not all he's got.

05:30.421 --> 05:32.062
Look. Surveillance gear.

05:35.175 --> 05:36.613
Ooh.

05:36.614 --> 05:38.319
State of the art.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.764
Light-years ahead of anything
the department has.

05:40.765 --> 05:42.237
Yeah.

05:44.613 --> 05:47.256
Who the hell is this guy?

05:47.257 --> 05:49.598
Look, the guns could fit
with terrorism,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.438
But the wiretapping equipment?

05:51.439 --> 05:52.646
Maybe he's a spy.

05:52.647 --> 05:54.318
He's got military training.

05:54.319 --> 05:56.392
It says here he was a commando
in the Saudi special forces.

05:56.393 --> 05:57.666
But then there's this...

05:57.667 --> 06:00.844
25 grand wired to him
every month

06:00.845 --> 06:02.752
from a Swiss bank account.

06:02.753 --> 06:05.395
Whatever he was doing,
he was well funded.

06:05.396 --> 06:06.735
What did his fellow students
have to say?

06:06.736 --> 06:09.546
Well, I talked to most of
the girls

06:09.547 --> 06:11.187
on Bram Stoker's list,

06:11.188 --> 06:12.693
and none of them
noticed Hasim in class

06:12.694 --> 06:14.198
or even know who he was.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.704
It's like the guy
was invisible.

06:15.705 --> 06:18.281
He was hiding in plain sight.

06:18.282 --> 06:19.755
A foreign agent in deep cover

06:19.756 --> 06:22.164
on some kind of
special reconnaissance mission.

06:22.165 --> 06:23.736
So then why would he
shoot up a van?

06:23.737 --> 06:25.177
Maybe Jack Bauer was driving.

06:25.178 --> 06:27.351
Yo. Ryan's hunting through
traffic cam footage

06:27.352 --> 06:28.625
looking for that van.

06:28.626 --> 06:30.766
In the meantime,
things with Hasim

06:30.767 --> 06:31.903
just keeping getting weirder.

06:31.904 --> 06:33.876
Tech went over
that surveillance gear.

06:33.877 --> 06:36.220
It looks like he was using it
to monitor an active bug

06:36.221 --> 06:37.559
installed in some apartment

06:37.560 --> 06:38.833
about a half a mile
from his place.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.370
Whose apartment was it?

06:40.371 --> 06:41.878
According to the lease,
it belonged

06:41.879 --> 06:43.785
to this chick...
Sara El-Masri.

06:43.786 --> 06:46.763
I called and left a message
on her cell phone.

06:46.764 --> 06:48.706
Wait a minute. Sara El-Masri
was one of the students

06:48.707 --> 06:50.210
in the Joyce class.

06:50.211 --> 06:52.955
She was one of the girls
on Bram Stoker's flirt list.

06:52.956 --> 06:54.662
What did she say about Hasim?

06:54.663 --> 06:57.927
I-I couldn't reach her.
I just left a message.

06:57.928 --> 07:00.309
Hey, guys. I got something here
you need to see.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.925
Unfortunately, there were

07:01.926 --> 07:03.800
no traffic or security cams
near the crime scene.

07:03.801 --> 07:05.908
But we did find this footage,

07:05.909 --> 07:08.350
shot down the street
from where Hasim was hit.

07:08.351 --> 07:10.461
That's definitely the van
that took him out.

07:10.462 --> 07:13.003
Front end's all crunched up.
You can see the bullet holes.

07:13.004 --> 07:14.845
Yeah, now watch this.

07:21.505 --> 07:23.813
Wait. Uh...

07:23.814 --> 07:25.656
go back to where she ran out.

07:25.657 --> 07:27.897
Zoom in on her face.

07:31.882 --> 07:33.989
That's Sara El-Masri.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.599
She was abducted.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.597
And Hasim died
trying to stop it.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.483
Whoever this is,
he abducted a girl

07:51.484 --> 07:53.353
and he killed our victim.

07:53.354 --> 07:54.725
So what do we know about him
from the video?

07:54.726 --> 07:55.963
He's a male, late 30s,

07:55.964 --> 07:57.603
no distinguishing scars
or tattoos.

07:57.604 --> 07:59.677
But we sent the footage
over to the FBI to see if

07:59.678 --> 08:01.655
they can run it through their
facial recognition software.

08:01.656 --> 08:03.795
Are they updated
on the abduction?

08:03.796 --> 08:05.300
Yes, and they're sending over
an agent to liaise.

08:05.301 --> 08:06.976
Meanwhile, we're checking
other traffic cams

08:06.977 --> 08:08.983
to see if we can track
where that van went

08:08.984 --> 08:10.187
after Sara tried to escape.

08:10.188 --> 08:11.928
Hasim was surveilling
her apartment

08:11.929 --> 08:13.401
and he was nearby
when she was kidnapped.

08:13.402 --> 08:15.073
But why?
What was their relationship?

08:15.074 --> 08:16.683
Well, Sara's roommate's
coming in.

08:16.684 --> 08:18.187
Maybe she has an answer.

08:18.188 --> 08:19.695
There were no phone calls
between them.

08:19.696 --> 08:21.969
It's looking more like
he was stalking her.

08:21.970 --> 08:23.340
Not only did he wiretap
her place,

08:23.341 --> 08:25.250
he was also taking two classes
that she was in.

08:25.251 --> 08:28.127
Maybe it's like
"the conversation."

08:28.128 --> 08:29.901
I'm sorry. I don't...

08:29.902 --> 08:31.072
Francis Ford Coppola.

08:31.073 --> 08:32.712
Gene Hackman. Very underrated.
Thank you.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.120
Um, in it,
a surveillance expert

08:34.121 --> 08:36.126
overhears a plot against
the woman he's bugging.

08:36.128 --> 08:38.904
Maybe Hasim got wind
of the kidnapping,

08:38.905 --> 08:40.308
tried to thwart it,
and paid with his life.

08:40.309 --> 08:42.452
Ah, that still doesn't explain
the guns in his apartment.

08:42.453 --> 08:44.427
True. Gene Hackman did not
possess an arsenal.

08:44.428 --> 08:47.105
So it could be that Hasim
was in on the kidnapping

08:47.106 --> 08:48.210
and it went sideways.

08:48.211 --> 08:49.548
Or he got cold feet.

08:49.549 --> 08:51.254
All right, dig into
his e-Mails and phone records.

08:51.255 --> 08:52.460
Let's see
who he was in touch with.

08:52.461 --> 08:54.033
On it.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.213
So here's what I've dug up
on Sara El-Masri.

08:57.214 --> 08:59.789
She's a sophomore majoring
in Marine biology.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.133
She was born in Cairo to
an uber-Wealthy Egyptian family.

09:02.134 --> 09:04.241
So this could've been
a kidnapping for Ransom.

09:04.242 --> 09:05.378
Where are her parents?

09:05.379 --> 09:06.917
The El-Masris have a place
at the Dakota.

09:06.918 --> 09:08.224
They're on their way in now.

09:08.225 --> 09:09.528
I am sick in my heart.

09:09.529 --> 09:11.236
I-I just...

09:11.237 --> 09:13.211
I just want my daughter back.

09:13.212 --> 09:14.917
And we're doing
everything that we can

09:14.918 --> 09:16.223
to make that happen,
Mr. El-Masri,

09:16.224 --> 09:17.996
along with the FBI.

09:17.997 --> 09:19.569
She's Only 20 years old,

09:19.570 --> 09:21.243
a child.

09:21.244 --> 09:22.315
Who did this to her?

09:22.316 --> 09:24.021
Well, so far we know that

09:24.022 --> 09:25.929
at least two people
were involved.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.272
The driver and this man.

09:28.273 --> 09:30.581
Does he look familiar to you?

09:30.582 --> 09:32.221
No, not to me. Lina?

09:32.222 --> 09:33.626
No.

09:33.627 --> 09:35.166
I will pay them.

09:35.167 --> 09:37.174
I will pay whatever they ask.

09:37.175 --> 09:38.481
What if that isn't
what they want?

09:38.482 --> 09:41.090
You've made enemies, anwar.

09:41.091 --> 09:42.966
In Egypt, not here.
This is about money.

09:42.967 --> 09:45.206
It is... It's always
about money.

09:45.207 --> 09:46.947
It's also about this man.

09:46.948 --> 09:48.254
Hasim Farouk...
Have you ever seen him?

09:48.255 --> 09:51.131
Yeah, I tried to reach Hasim
when I learned of this.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.304
Perhaps he can help us I...

09:52.305 --> 09:53.975
Wait. You know him?

09:53.976 --> 09:56.351
Sara would not accept
a bodyguard,

09:56.352 --> 09:59.665
so I hired Hasim
to watch over her discreetly.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.707
Where is he?

10:01.708 --> 10:03.516
He died trying to protect her.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.765
Now you hired him
to guard Sara.

10:07.766 --> 10:09.205
Was she receiving threats?

10:09.206 --> 10:10.610
No.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.417
But a man in my...

10:12.418 --> 10:14.659
position...

10:14.660 --> 10:17.203
I-I begged Sara
to be careful,

10:17.204 --> 10:19.480
but she said, "Papa, you...
You worry too much."

10:19.481 --> 10:23.295
She thinks like an American now.
Tr-Trusts like an American.

10:23.296 --> 10:26.842
I will pay anything.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.685
She's my only child.

10:28.686 --> 10:29.854
Please.

10:31.496 --> 10:33.502
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

10:36.482 --> 10:37.587
Detective Beckett,

10:37.588 --> 10:39.159
Mr. Castle,

10:39.160 --> 10:40.430
this is agent Harris.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.637
He'll be running point
on the kidnapping.

10:41.638 --> 10:43.175
Good to meet you.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.484
Detective Ryan brought me
up to speed on things.

10:45.485 --> 10:46.556
How are the El-Masris?

10:46.557 --> 10:48.463
Scared. Devastated.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.471
Okay, that's good.

10:50.472 --> 10:51.643
It is?

10:51.644 --> 10:53.283
It beats angry or defensive.

10:53.284 --> 10:55.357
They want to be helpful
and honest, which is important,

10:55.358 --> 10:56.494
'cause at the end of the day,

10:56.495 --> 10:57.836
it's the accuracy
of our information

10:57.837 --> 11:00.846
that can determine whether
This ends well or badly.

11:00.847 --> 11:02.220
I'll keep you in the loop.

11:02.221 --> 11:04.396
We'll do the same.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.423
So I got Ryan and Esposito
looking into

11:11.424 --> 11:13.431
Sara's movements
from last night.

11:13.432 --> 11:15.673
I figure if we can find out

11:15.674 --> 11:17.416
what she was doing
in lower Manhattan,

11:17.417 --> 11:19.725
that could lead us to
whoever killed Hasim.

11:24.644 --> 11:26.585
Are you okay?

11:26.586 --> 11:28.460
Oh, yeah. I just...

11:28.461 --> 11:31.705
can't imagine what they're
going through right now.

11:31.706 --> 11:34.483
Do you think that This
is really about money?

11:34.484 --> 11:36.492
Did a web search
on El-Masri.

11:36.493 --> 11:38.633
He's worth over $300 million.

11:38.634 --> 11:40.442
Yeah, but still,
who hires an ex-Commando

11:40.443 --> 11:41.980
to babysit their daughter?

11:41.982 --> 11:43.487
I've considered it.

11:43.488 --> 11:45.093
And I don't doubt that,

11:45.094 --> 11:46.566
but did you see
how he shut her down

11:46.567 --> 11:48.473
when she brought up enemies?

11:48.474 --> 11:49.779
He just doesn't want
to believe the worst,

11:49.780 --> 11:51.452
and frankly, I can't blame him.

11:51.453 --> 11:54.666
Hey. So I just interviewed
Sara's roommate Amber.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.639
She wasn't any help with Hasim
or the kidnapping,

11:56.640 --> 11:58.348
but she did say that Sara
went out last night.

11:58.349 --> 11:59.651
Where did she go?

11:59.652 --> 12:00.757
All Amber could remember

12:00.758 --> 12:03.400
is that it was some kind
of science thing.

12:03.401 --> 12:05.978
Okay, I found three
science-Related events

12:05.979 --> 12:08.454
in Lower Manhattan
from last night.

12:08.455 --> 12:11.467
First, a Sci-Fi movie marathon
at an art House theater

12:11.468 --> 12:13.776
eight blocks
from where Hasim got clocked.

12:13.777 --> 12:15.417
Though, by definition,
science fiction

12:15.418 --> 12:16.755
is not science.

12:16.756 --> 12:18.596
It has the word in it.

12:18.597 --> 12:19.634
It's...
That's an excellent point.

12:19.635 --> 12:21.473
What are the other two?

12:21.474 --> 12:23.918
Uh, a stargazing tour led by
an actual astronomer

12:23.919 --> 12:26.594
and a speech from a scientist
named Hayden Posner,

12:26.595 --> 12:28.770
uh, in the ballroom
of the Beaumont hotel.

12:28.771 --> 12:30.711
Dr. Posner... He's an expert
on climate change.

12:30.712 --> 12:32.955
Alexis bought me his book,
which I still haven't read.

12:32.956 --> 12:35.096
And the Beaumont hotel
would explain why Sara

12:35.097 --> 12:36.736
was in lower Manhattan.

12:36.737 --> 12:38.108
And she's
a Marine biology major,

12:38.109 --> 12:39.648
which means she would be
interested in climate change.

12:39.649 --> 12:40.853
Let's go.

12:40.854 --> 12:42.559
Yes, I remember her.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.505
A very lovely young woman.

12:45.506 --> 12:48.818
Sara El-Masri.
Yes, she definitely attended.

12:48.819 --> 12:50.158
I checked her in myself.

12:50.159 --> 12:51.764
Did you notice anything
unusual about her?

12:51.765 --> 12:53.102
No.

12:53.103 --> 12:55.578
After Dr. Posner's presentation,
she stayed for the q&a,

12:55.579 --> 12:57.052
which went rather late,
and then she left.

12:57.053 --> 12:58.725
Any idea where she went?

12:58.726 --> 13:00.165
All I know is that
she exited the ballroom.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.574
I stayed on to set up
for a wedding reception.

13:02.575 --> 13:03.645
Did she speak with anyone?

13:03.646 --> 13:05.653
Just the person she was with.

13:05.654 --> 13:06.824
Who was that?

13:06.825 --> 13:08.029
A young woman.

13:08.030 --> 13:09.166
They sat together.
They seemed to be friends.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.607
But I couldn't tell you
her name.

13:10.608 --> 13:12.849
Do you think you could
describe this woman?

13:12.850 --> 13:15.760
Red hair, uh, pale skin,
uh, also very lovely.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.807
Can I... see that
for a moment?

13:20.380 --> 13:21.851
It's Alexis.
She's on the list.

13:21.852 --> 13:23.023
She was here last night.

13:23.024 --> 13:24.361
Well, maybe she knows her.

13:24.362 --> 13:25.835
Maybe they met at the event.

13:25.836 --> 13:27.876
At the very least, I'm sure
she can help us out.

13:27.877 --> 13:29.851
Mm-hmm.

13:31.693 --> 13:34.671
That's her ringtone.

13:38.052 --> 13:39.859
What's that?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.298
Our lost and found.

13:41.299 --> 13:43.875
In fact, a guest turned in
a phone last night.

13:43.876 --> 13:45.382
They found it
in the street out front.

13:51.373 --> 13:54.184
They took Alexis, too.

13:59.204 --> 14:00.810
Mr. Castle,

14:00.811 --> 14:02.382
we will do everything
in our power

14:02.383 --> 14:03.754
to get your daughter back.

14:03.755 --> 14:04.926
I don't want to be handled.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.867
Just let me know
where things stand.

14:06.868 --> 14:09.212
Let's start with the facts
as we now understand them.

14:09.213 --> 14:11.252
Your daughter attended
last night's event

14:11.253 --> 14:13.060
with Sara El-Masri.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.035
Apparently they met in
an environmental science class

14:15.036 --> 14:16.440
and became friends.

14:16.441 --> 14:19.017
GPS on her phone shows that
it was left outside the hotel

14:19.018 --> 14:21.159
shortly after the event ended.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.205
That plus the fact that no one
has seen or heard from her

14:24.206 --> 14:25.879
in the 16 hours since

14:25.880 --> 14:28.990
leads us to conclude that she,
too, was forced into the van.

14:28.991 --> 14:30.932
Now why would they take Alexis

14:30.933 --> 14:32.203
if Sara was the target?

14:32.204 --> 14:34.110
She was probably
with Sara at the time.

14:34.111 --> 14:35.249
She was a witness.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.159
It would've been easier
to take her

14:37.160 --> 14:38.931
than... not.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.009
So you're saying She was

14:42.010 --> 14:43.147
just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.320
It appears that way.

14:44.321 --> 14:46.027
Do you have any suspects?

14:46.028 --> 14:47.197
We have a name.

14:47.198 --> 14:48.404
Facial recognition

14:48.405 --> 14:50.444
gave us an I.D.
on the man in the video.

14:50.445 --> 14:51.583
Roger Henson.

14:51.584 --> 14:53.290
We know him mainly

14:53.291 --> 14:56.067
as a mid-Level
narcotics smuggler.

14:56.068 --> 14:57.607
If we know he's out there,

14:57.608 --> 14:59.113
we can get him.

14:59.114 --> 15:00.216
We can initiate a manhunt.

15:00.217 --> 15:02.091
We're already searching
for Henson

15:02.092 --> 15:04.068
along with
all his known associates.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.476
But he is a career felon.

15:06.477 --> 15:08.216
Finding him won't be easy.

15:08.217 --> 15:10.257
What's a drug smuggler doing
involved in a kidnapping?

15:10.258 --> 15:11.362
We're not sure.

15:11.363 --> 15:13.171
But Roger Henson
is not a shot caller.

15:13.172 --> 15:15.345
He's a middleman, a hired gun.

15:15.346 --> 15:17.488
He may have been hired
to abduct the girls.

15:17.489 --> 15:19.128
What happens now?

15:19.129 --> 15:20.969
We press ahead
on multiple fronts

15:20.970 --> 15:22.374
with a focus on Henson.

15:22.375 --> 15:24.314
Locating him
could crack the case.

15:24.315 --> 15:25.621
We're also creating
contingency plans

15:25.622 --> 15:27.294
for when and if

15:27.295 --> 15:28.534
the kidnappers make contact.

15:28.535 --> 15:30.172
If? What do you mean if?

15:30.173 --> 15:32.181
We know that the El-Masris
are wealthy,

15:32.182 --> 15:34.591
and you told us
Sara was the target.

15:34.592 --> 15:37.469
Mr. El-Masri admitted
he had close ties

15:37.470 --> 15:39.644
with the previous
regime in Egypt.

15:39.645 --> 15:42.756
As a result, he made
some very powerful enemies.

15:42.757 --> 15:45.300
It's possible
his daughter's abduction

15:45.301 --> 15:46.706
was motivated by revenge.

15:46.707 --> 15:48.380
Okay, where does that
leave my daughter?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.254
I mean, if...

15:50.255 --> 15:51.391
if she wasn't the one
they were after

15:51.392 --> 15:52.832
and she's just in the way...

15:52.833 --> 15:55.207
Mr. Castle,
you need to stay positive.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.115
Whatever their motives,

15:57.116 --> 15:59.424
the kidnappers will realize
she has value.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.202
Now what we need to do next
is go to your home

16:02.203 --> 16:04.210
and set up a trap and trace
on your phone lines

16:04.211 --> 16:07.357
so we're ready for their call.

16:07.358 --> 16:09.499
I'll wait for you outside.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.820
Gates will see.

16:22.821 --> 16:25.698
I don't care.

16:27.339 --> 16:29.681
I can't believe
This is happening.

16:29.682 --> 16:32.492
We're gonna find her, Castle.

16:32.493 --> 16:34.535
We will.

16:46.784 --> 16:48.523
You do whatever you need to do

16:48.524 --> 16:50.397
to get him back
his little girl.

16:50.398 --> 16:52.907
Anything you need, detective.

16:52.908 --> 16:55.319
Thank you, sir.

16:58.599 --> 16:59.701
How's he doing?

16:59.702 --> 17:01.575
It's Alexis.
He's gotta be wrecked.

17:01.576 --> 17:02.679
Hell, I'm wrecked.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.987
Yeah, well, we gotta
put all of that aside

17:03.988 --> 17:05.325
and help him find her.

17:05.326 --> 17:06.461
Where are we on the van?

17:06.462 --> 17:07.936
We've been working
the traffic cam footage

17:07.938 --> 17:09.474
and we made some headway.

17:09.476 --> 17:10.512
After the van
left lower Manhattan,

17:10.512 --> 17:11.650
we picked it up
on east river drive,

17:11.651 --> 17:13.358
heading towards
the queens midtown tunnel.

17:13.358 --> 17:15.366
We gotta figure out
where that van went.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.375
Let's bring in some more bodies
to review the footage.

17:17.376 --> 17:20.887
We find the van,
we'll find Alexis.

17:20.888 --> 17:22.462
You'll let us know
if you need anything?

17:22.463 --> 17:23.968
Certainly, sir.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.586
Oh, mother...

17:28.587 --> 17:30.126
I'm sorry.

17:30.127 --> 17:31.631
I am so sorry.

17:31.632 --> 17:34.142
Richard, this is not
your fault.

17:34.143 --> 17:35.515
I don't know.
Maybe if I'd just...

17:35.516 --> 17:38.091
No ifs. Do not
torture yourself with ifs.

17:38.092 --> 17:39.631
The only people to blame
for this

17:39.632 --> 17:40.769
are the ones who took her.

17:40.770 --> 17:42.710
Alexis is
her father's daughter.

17:42.711 --> 17:44.785
She is strong and she is smart

17:44.786 --> 17:46.460
and she is going to
get through this.

17:46.461 --> 17:47.764
Yeah, I know.

17:47.765 --> 17:49.906
No, no, no.
I'm not just saying this.

17:49.907 --> 17:51.445
She's gonna be all right.

17:51.446 --> 17:55.662
I feel it in my heart,
and my heart is never wrong.

17:55.663 --> 17:56.901
What about your first marriage?

17:56.902 --> 17:58.072
Well...

17:58.073 --> 17:59.511
And your second?

17:59.512 --> 18:00.682
Okay, fine, fine.

18:00.683 --> 18:01.654
Occasionally,
my heart is wrong.

18:01.655 --> 18:04.097
But it is not in this case.

18:04.098 --> 18:06.004
I just keep wondering,

18:06.005 --> 18:07.645
how did the kidnappers know

18:07.646 --> 18:09.585
Sara was gonna be
at the Beaumont hotel?

18:09.586 --> 18:10.758
You have Kate Beckett

18:10.759 --> 18:13.534
and the FBI
tracking Alexis down.

18:13.535 --> 18:14.842
Just let them do their job.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.815
And they need for you
to be here.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.931
Okay.

18:20.932 --> 18:22.806
What do you got?

18:22.807 --> 18:24.949
Our van exited
the queens to midtown tunnel...

18:24.950 --> 18:26.654
to greenpoint.

18:26.655 --> 18:27.791
Took greenpoint ave.
To McGuinness...

18:27.792 --> 18:30.135
Then went west on huron.
Then where'd the van go?

18:30.136 --> 18:31.607
Well, we're not sure,
but this area right here,

18:31.608 --> 18:33.246
it's pretty much boxed in
by greenpoint ave...

18:33.247 --> 18:35.054
McGuinness and Franklin.

18:35.055 --> 18:36.594
We check the video
feeds from those streets.

18:36.595 --> 18:37.768
The van went
into that neighborhood,

18:37.769 --> 18:39.105
but never came out.

18:39.106 --> 18:40.743
The girls have to be
somewhere in there...

18:40.744 --> 18:41.782
Along with Henson.

18:41.783 --> 18:42.919
Okay, so how big
is our search zone?

18:42.920 --> 18:44.124
20 square blocks.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.898
Okay, coordinate with the feds
and queens P.D.

18:45.899 --> 18:47.909
We need to do a street by Street
search for that van.

18:47.910 --> 18:50.887
Plainclothes
and unmarked cars only.

19:07.321 --> 19:09.997
So I'm sitting by the Fountain
on the South quad this morning,

19:09.998 --> 19:11.369
sipping my macchiato,

19:11.370 --> 19:13.077
trying to study
for a chem quiz,

19:13.078 --> 19:14.415
and I had this...

19:14.416 --> 19:16.389
I guess it was
another freshman moment.

19:16.390 --> 19:18.867
I'm sure eventually
I'll become jaded and cynical,

19:18.868 --> 19:20.975
But not today.

19:20.976 --> 19:23.954
Today I look around,
and I see beautiful buildings,

19:23.955 --> 19:25.796
I see students who are
just like me

19:25.797 --> 19:27.300
and nothing like me,

19:27.301 --> 19:29.944
and I feel...

19:29.945 --> 19:33.258
Overwhelmed...
with all the possibilities,

19:33.259 --> 19:37.140
with how lucky I am
to be a part of this

19:37.141 --> 19:42.129
and... how there's nowhere on
earth I'd rather be right now.

19:45.342 --> 19:47.013
Now stand by for a geek alert.

19:47.014 --> 19:48.319
Me and my friend Sara

19:48.320 --> 19:49.826
got tickets to go see
Dr. Posner speak

19:49.827 --> 19:51.130
at the Beaumont tonight.

19:51.131 --> 19:52.937
And for those of you
who don't know,

19:52.938 --> 19:54.880
Dr. Posner is one of
the foremost thinkers

19:54.881 --> 19:57.289
on climate change,
a personal hero of mine,

19:57.290 --> 19:59.228
and I can't wait to hear...
You see?
Are you watching?

19:59.229 --> 20:01.473
What he has to say.
Castle, if the kidnappers knew
that Alexis and Sara

20:01.474 --> 20:02.845
were friends...

20:02.846 --> 20:04.084
They did know.
They had to know.

20:04.085 --> 20:06.994
They tracked Sara to the hotel
from this video.

20:06.995 --> 20:09.001
Alexis posted it yesterday
afternoon at 2:36.

20:09.002 --> 20:10.977
The kidnappers must have
accessed her web site.

20:10.978 --> 20:12.014
Okay, I'm contacting tech
right now.

20:12.015 --> 20:13.187
Have them trace

20:13.188 --> 20:15.295
every I.P. Address
that accessed that site

20:15.296 --> 20:17.370
after 2:36 P.M.

20:17.371 --> 20:19.042
Which might take time,
depending on...

20:19.043 --> 20:20.284
What if she doesn't have time?

20:20.285 --> 20:22.558
Castle, listen to me...

20:22.559 --> 20:25.068
Don't.

20:25.069 --> 20:27.545
Don't promise me you'll find her
unless you can do it,

20:27.546 --> 20:29.587
because...

20:29.588 --> 20:32.298
I would never forgive you.

20:34.039 --> 20:36.581
Anymore than I'd ever
forgive myself.

20:36.582 --> 20:39.092
Beckett.

20:39.093 --> 20:41.067
We got something.

20:41.068 --> 20:42.605
What's that? Beckett?

20:42.606 --> 20:44.549
What's going on?

20:46.958 --> 20:48.194
Castle, I gotta go.

20:48.195 --> 20:50.001
I'll call you as soon
as I find something, okay?

20:50.002 --> 20:51.440
Beckett, wait.

21:00.245 --> 21:02.085
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I will.

21:04.274 --> 21:06.114
That was L.T.
From the precinct.

21:06.115 --> 21:07.788
He said all he knows
is that they found the van

21:07.789 --> 21:09.528
parked since last night.

21:09.529 --> 21:14.146
Well, Beckett will call you
as soon as she has some news.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.585
The van's in Greenpoint.

21:15.586 --> 21:17.593
She would've gotten there
over an hour ago.

21:17.594 --> 21:20.405
The only reason
she wouldn't have called...

21:20.406 --> 21:22.045
stop it, Richard.

21:22.046 --> 21:24.119
We... we don't know that.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.266
Oh, Darling,
go to Greenpoint. Go.

21:27.267 --> 21:30.246
Go. I can handle things here.

21:34.464 --> 21:36.102
Hey.

21:36.103 --> 21:37.875
Castle,
what are you doing here?

21:37.876 --> 21:39.481
The precinct told me
that you found the van.

21:39.482 --> 21:40.753
Why the hell
wouldn't you call me?

21:40.754 --> 21:42.226
'Cause we don't know
what this is yet.

21:42.227 --> 21:43.330
Castle, please, you don't need
to see this, okay?

21:43.331 --> 21:45.172
What's in the van?
Castle, just please...

21:45.173 --> 21:46.712
What's in the van?!

21:51.432 --> 21:53.138
Oh, Lanie.
Whose blood is that?

21:53.139 --> 21:54.811
Did someone die in there?

21:54.812 --> 21:56.317
Lanie, did she die in there?

21:56.318 --> 21:58.360
Castle, we don't know, okay?

21:58.361 --> 22:00.300
Not yet.
Lanie just got here.

22:00.301 --> 22:01.873
What is Alexis' blood type?

22:01.874 --> 22:03.245
A-Positive.

22:03.246 --> 22:04.418
Okay, just give me a minute.

22:04.419 --> 22:06.358
Come on.
Let's go over here.

22:26.272 --> 22:27.846
Is it a match?

22:27.847 --> 22:30.523
It's B-negative.
It's not from your baby.

22:30.524 --> 22:31.493
Oh, God. Thank you.

22:31.494 --> 22:32.665
I'm right there
with you, honey.

22:32.666 --> 22:35.342
I gotta go let
Agent Harris know.

22:35.343 --> 22:36.814
So she's safe.
She's here somewhere, right?

22:36.815 --> 22:38.554
She's gotta be
around here somewhere?

22:38.555 --> 22:39.491
She was.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.796
Castle, there was a blood trail

22:40.797 --> 22:42.336
that led from the van,
and it stopped.

22:42.337 --> 22:44.011
We think that the kidnappers
changed cars.

22:44.012 --> 22:45.817
Whose van is it?

22:45.818 --> 22:47.324
It was stolen a week ago.

22:47.325 --> 22:48.495
Any fingerprints?

22:48.496 --> 22:49.566
C.S.U. is looking.

22:49.567 --> 22:50.637
We've got uniforms
canvassing the area.

22:50.638 --> 22:52.546
Castle, listen,
if there is a lead,

22:52.547 --> 22:53.918
we are gonna find it.

22:53.919 --> 22:55.591
Beckett.

22:55.592 --> 22:57.900
I'll be right back. Okay?

23:01.014 --> 23:03.589
Mr. And Mrs. El-Masri, I need to
speak to you for a moment.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.497
We're absolutely positive.

23:05.498 --> 23:08.443
We tested the blood twice
just to be sure.

23:14.568 --> 23:16.609
The blood, it's not from Sara.

23:16.610 --> 23:17.846
And not Alexis either.

23:17.847 --> 23:18.987
Then there's hope.

23:18.988 --> 23:20.425
Yeah.

23:20.426 --> 23:21.898
I-I regret

23:21.899 --> 23:23.906
that your daughter
was drawn into this.

23:23.907 --> 23:26.984
What is it exactly
they've been drawn into?

23:26.985 --> 23:29.060
I wish I knew.

23:58.681 --> 23:59.853
Sara?

24:01.760 --> 24:02.663
Sara?

24:03.937 --> 24:05.809
Sara, are you okay?

24:08.254 --> 24:10.160
I think.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.650
Where are we?

24:15.651 --> 24:16.686
I don't know.

24:16.687 --> 24:19.899
Wait. The speech.
The hotel.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.007
We left the hotel
and then that guy,

24:22.008 --> 24:23.615
he forced us into a van

24:23.616 --> 24:27.397
and... It's all
a bit of a blur.

24:30.744 --> 24:32.685
I think we were drugged.

24:33.924 --> 24:35.697
We still have our clothes on.

24:35.698 --> 24:37.906
At least that's a good sign.

24:40.853 --> 24:42.156
This is all my fault.

24:42.157 --> 24:44.767
My parents warned me about this

24:44.768 --> 24:46.442
since they first sent me
to boarding school.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.352
They even made me sit through
a lecture on kidnapping

24:49.353 --> 24:51.762
from the head
of corporate security.

24:51.763 --> 24:53.769
Wait. Why would somebody
kidnap you?

24:53.770 --> 24:55.109
My father's crazy rich.

24:55.110 --> 24:57.820
Well, the good news is,
is that he'll pay the Ransom.

24:57.821 --> 25:00.999
I mean, that's what
this must be, right?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.170
Right.

25:02.171 --> 25:03.845
Anyway, my dad will find us.

25:03.846 --> 25:04.981
He works with the police.

25:04.982 --> 25:06.857
I'm sure he's looking for us
right now.

25:06.858 --> 25:09.736
So they'll get us out of here?

25:12.782 --> 25:15.392
I wonder what's in there.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.063
Okay, this is creepy.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.840
Clothes, towels?

25:35.841 --> 25:38.149
At least this means
they want us alive.

25:42.602 --> 25:44.542
See?

25:44.543 --> 25:46.920
They're taking care of us.

25:48.359 --> 25:50.032
That was agent Harris.

25:50.033 --> 25:51.906
A witness saw a black Yukon

25:51.907 --> 25:54.249
leaving Greenpoint
just after the van arrived.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.592
The kidnappers must Have
switched over to the Yukon.

25:56.593 --> 25:58.165
They've had
a 24-Hour head start.

25:58.166 --> 25:59.938
They could be anywhere by now.

25:59.939 --> 26:01.276
Where's c.S.U.
On the blood?

26:01.277 --> 26:02.918
Spatter analysis shows
that it came from the driver.

26:02.919 --> 26:04.255
He was shot by Hasim.

26:04.256 --> 26:05.693
He would've left prints
in the van.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.033
He must be in the system.

26:07.034 --> 26:08.706
No c.S.U. Only found
Roger Henson's prints.

26:08.707 --> 26:10.179
There's no other matches.

26:10.180 --> 26:11.587
We must have
a lead here somewhere.

26:11.588 --> 26:14.296
Maybe we do.
C.S.U. Inspected the van.

26:14.297 --> 26:15.567
Found that a bunch
of performance Tweaks

26:15.569 --> 26:17.343
were done to it...
Octane booster in the tank,

26:17.344 --> 26:19.216
catalytic converter
was bypassed,

26:19.217 --> 26:21.458
the E.C.U. Was re-Chipped
to boost up the horsepower.

26:21.459 --> 26:23.234
Somebody upgraded it
to a getaway car.

26:23.235 --> 26:25.375
Not just somebody.
A real pro.

26:25.376 --> 26:26.747
Probably our driver.

26:26.748 --> 26:29.224
Okay, look for a wheelman
whose m.O. Is

26:29.225 --> 26:30.562
to steal getaway cars
and retune them.

26:30.563 --> 26:31.768
Someone with
b-Negative blood.

26:31.769 --> 26:33.709
Right.

26:42.512 --> 26:44.051
That security guy,

26:44.052 --> 26:46.092
you said he talked to you
about kidnapping.

26:46.094 --> 26:47.330
What kind of stuff did he say?

26:47.331 --> 26:48.701
What if no one's
looking for us?

26:48.702 --> 26:50.509
What if they don't even
realize that we're gone?

26:50.510 --> 26:52.452
Sara, let's focus on
the questions we can answer,

26:52.453 --> 26:53.790
build on what we know.

26:53.791 --> 26:56.099
We don't know anything.
That's the problem.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.606
We don't know who took us

26:57.607 --> 26:59.546
or for how long we'll be here
or even where we are.

26:59.547 --> 27:01.087
Okay.
Well, let's figure that out.

27:01.088 --> 27:02.693
Let's figure out where we are.

27:02.694 --> 27:03.864
Um...

27:04.869 --> 27:06.374
Hear that?

27:06.375 --> 27:10.458
Space under the floor.
So we're not in a basement.

27:10.459 --> 27:13.370
And this is
a much older building,

27:13.371 --> 27:16.180
based on how worn the floor is.

27:16.181 --> 27:17.353
And there's the sound.

27:17.354 --> 27:18.523
What sound?

27:18.524 --> 27:20.197
Exactly.

27:20.198 --> 27:22.172
No car honks,

27:22.173 --> 27:23.445
no traffic noise.

27:23.446 --> 27:26.824
Either this room
is seriously soundproof

27:26.825 --> 27:28.934
or we're not in New York.

27:30.606 --> 27:33.952
Looks like your hunch paid off.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.191
Douglas Stevens.

27:35.192 --> 27:36.799
He did a Nickel
as a getaway driver

27:36.800 --> 27:38.204
for a bank robbery.

27:38.205 --> 27:38.972
And guess who did time
with him.

27:38.973 --> 27:40.344
None other than Roger Henson.

27:40.345 --> 27:41.819
Do the prison records
show his blood type?

27:41.820 --> 27:42.990
B-Negative.

27:42.991 --> 27:44.629
Okay, I'm gonna put out
an a.P.B.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.470
And alert all hospitals.

27:46.471 --> 27:47.808
With the amount of blood
that he lost,

27:47.809 --> 27:48.980
he's gonna need
medical treatment.

27:48.981 --> 27:50.422
He might not need a hospital.

27:50.423 --> 27:52.830
Douglas Stevens has a sister
who's a nurse.

27:52.831 --> 27:55.741
Guess who called in sick today.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.817
NYPD, open up!

27:59.257 --> 28:00.762
What is this?

28:00.763 --> 28:02.971
What are you people doing here?

28:02.972 --> 28:03.941
We're here for your brother.

28:03.942 --> 28:05.313
Doug? I haven't seen him
in weeks.

28:05.314 --> 28:06.617
I don't know where he is.

28:06.618 --> 28:07.957
Yeah, well, we're not
gonna take your word for it.

28:07.958 --> 28:09.462
Hey, you can't just
Barge in here.

28:09.463 --> 28:10.870
Actually, ma'am, we can.

28:18.735 --> 28:19.973
NYPD!

28:19.974 --> 28:21.947
Don't move.

28:21.948 --> 28:23.353
Douglas Stevens,

28:23.354 --> 28:25.834
you're under arrest.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.120
The girls that you took,
where are they?

28:32.121 --> 28:36.239
Where's your partner...
Roger Henson?

28:39.960 --> 28:41.967
Who put the two of you
up to this?

28:41.968 --> 28:43.306
I got nothing to say.

28:43.307 --> 28:46.385
Well, then you're gonna
go down for all of it.

28:46.386 --> 28:48.360
You were driving the van.

28:48.361 --> 28:50.235
That's murder,
two counts of kidnapping.

28:50.236 --> 28:53.480
Do you know how many years
you're gonna be in jail for?

28:53.481 --> 28:55.321
It's in the triple digits.

28:55.322 --> 28:59.572
Tell us where the girls are.
That's your only hope.

28:59.573 --> 29:02.585
Let me know
when my ambulance gets here.

29:05.999 --> 29:07.370
I'd like a minute with him.

29:26.382 --> 29:28.556
I just said
I don't want to talk,

29:28.557 --> 29:30.799
so you can't question me.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.204
I have rights.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.410
I'm not gonna say anything
without a lawyer.

29:33.411 --> 29:35.350
I'm not a cop.

29:35.351 --> 29:36.689
Then who are you?

29:36.690 --> 29:38.531
You remember the girl
with the red hair?

29:40.071 --> 29:41.743
I'm her father.

29:41.744 --> 29:44.520
Please know

29:44.521 --> 29:46.730
I will do whatever it takes

29:46.731 --> 29:50.110
to get her back.

29:50.111 --> 29:52.151
Those police outside
are my friends.

29:52.152 --> 29:55.766
My daughter's friends, too.

29:55.767 --> 29:58.779
So it's just you and me.

30:00.453 --> 30:02.126
If you touch me,
I'll press charges.

30:02.127 --> 30:03.900
I don't care.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.640
Where are they?

30:05.641 --> 30:07.615
I'm just a driver.
I-I don't know anything.

30:07.616 --> 30:11.129
You know Henson ditched
the van for the black Yukon.

30:11.130 --> 30:12.802
So where did he go?

30:12.803 --> 30:15.413
Where did he take the girls?

30:17.489 --> 30:19.799
I won't ask you again.
Where did he take the girls?

30:29.972 --> 30:31.947
AAH!

30:31.948 --> 30:34.256
Stop! Aah!

30:34.257 --> 30:36.298
Aah!

30:36.299 --> 30:37.804
The address Stevens gave you

30:37.805 --> 30:39.511
is to a farm off route 301.

30:39.512 --> 30:41.318
That's 60 Miles north
from here.

30:41.319 --> 30:42.991
Agent Harris
and a tactical team

30:42.992 --> 30:44.664
are heading to the location.

30:44.665 --> 30:45.835
Already?

30:45.836 --> 30:47.508
They should be arriving
at the farm any moment.

30:47.509 --> 30:48.949
And what will they do then?

30:48.950 --> 30:51.358
Whatever's necessary
to recover Alexis

30:51.359 --> 30:52.864
and her friend.

30:52.865 --> 30:55.041
But I'll let you know
the moment I have any news.

30:55.042 --> 30:56.780
Thank you.

30:58.454 --> 31:00.462
Do you want a coffee?

31:00.463 --> 31:03.609
No, thanks.
My adrenaline will suffice.

31:06.956 --> 31:08.427
Did you find out
who owns the farm?

31:08.428 --> 31:09.901
Nobody. The property's
been tied up in Foreclosure

31:09.902 --> 31:11.339
since 2009.

31:11.340 --> 31:15.490
It's been sitting empty.
It's isolated.

31:15.491 --> 31:17.095
Look, the FBI knows
what they're doing.

31:17.096 --> 31:19.038
They're trained
in hostage rescue.

31:19.039 --> 31:21.950
Alexis is in
the best possible hands.

31:21.951 --> 31:23.990
I'm tapped into
State police dispatch.

31:23.991 --> 31:26.736
The feds are on the scene
right now.

31:37.881 --> 31:39.019
That's our s.U.V.

31:39.020 --> 31:40.559
Okay, sooner or Later

31:40.560 --> 31:42.032
someone will show up
to bring us more food,

31:42.033 --> 31:43.939
and we need to be prepared.

31:43.940 --> 31:46.013
So what did
that security guy tell you?

31:46.014 --> 31:48.122
Avoid eye contact
with the captor

31:48.123 --> 31:49.794
so they don't perceive
you to be a witness.

31:49.795 --> 31:50.968
Good. What else?

31:50.969 --> 31:52.071
Be vulnerable.

31:52.072 --> 31:54.581
Try to let the captor
see you as human,

31:54.582 --> 31:56.188
as someone they can relate to.

31:56.189 --> 31:58.965
Try to build up trust,
build a relationship.

31:58.966 --> 32:01.108
How are we supposed
to build a relationship

32:01.109 --> 32:02.814
without eye contact?

32:02.815 --> 32:05.158
That's a good question.

32:10.647 --> 32:13.224
The minute she knows,
you'll know.

32:13.225 --> 32:15.231
I just wish
that minute was now.

32:15.232 --> 32:16.738
It's all happening too fast

32:16.739 --> 32:18.647
and too slow at the same time.

32:21.023 --> 32:24.336
Tell me what happened
with Douglas Stevens.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.219
I appealed to his humanity.

32:31.599 --> 32:34.711
I didn't think you had
that side to you.

32:34.712 --> 32:38.025
When it comes to the people
I love, I do.

33:03.126 --> 33:05.803
Put
the food tray under the door.

33:05.804 --> 33:07.309
My name's Alexis.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.351
This is Sara.

33:09.352 --> 33:13.302
Put the food tray
under the door.

33:24.348 --> 33:27.257
It's kind of cold in here.

33:27.258 --> 33:29.367
Is there any way we could
get some more blankets?

33:35.256 --> 33:36.429
What just happened?

33:36.430 --> 33:38.100
That man on the radio,

33:38.101 --> 33:39.440
he was speaking arabic.

33:39.441 --> 33:42.922
He said, "return to your post.
We have visitors."

33:55.338 --> 33:56.476
Go!

33:56.477 --> 33:59.856
Go! Go! Go!

34:01.062 --> 34:02.401
- Go! Go! Go!
- FBI! Hands up!

34:06.182 --> 34:10.031
You know, I still remember...

34:10.032 --> 34:12.942
When Alexis was born,
they handed me this...

34:12.943 --> 34:15.920
tiny person, all bundled up.

34:15.922 --> 34:17.929
She just...

34:17.931 --> 34:20.607
Stared up at me.

34:23.553 --> 34:25.259
And when I looked down at her,

34:25.260 --> 34:27.199
this feeling hit me...

34:30.280 --> 34:32.356
like I'd been struck
by lightning.

34:36.472 --> 34:39.384
It was love.

34:39.385 --> 34:42.460
That instant, inexplicable love

34:42.462 --> 34:45.141
you can only feel
for your child.

34:46.446 --> 34:49.291
In that moment, I knew.

34:50.697 --> 34:54.579
I knew my life
Had changed forever.

34:58.695 --> 35:01.507
And now it's about
to change again.

35:07.431 --> 35:09.673
Gates.

35:12.552 --> 35:13.489
Okay.

35:19.781 --> 35:23.328
The farmhouse was empty.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.304
Alexis and Sara are not there.

35:34.435 --> 35:35.607
You're sure she's not
in the cellar

35:35.608 --> 35:37.652
or some hidden room somewhere?

35:37.653 --> 35:39.394
We searched top to bottom.
They're gone.

35:39.395 --> 35:40.832
We did find these.

35:40.833 --> 35:42.740
Either of 'em belong to Alexis?

35:42.741 --> 35:44.749
Yeah, that one there.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.254
That's... That's hers.

35:46.255 --> 35:48.696
What does it mean that
her coat's here and she's not?

35:48.697 --> 35:50.068
This must have been
a way station

35:50.069 --> 35:51.508
until they moved
the girls someplace else.

35:51.509 --> 35:53.549
They've been one step
ahead of us this whole time.

35:53.550 --> 35:54.788
These people we're dealing with

35:54.789 --> 35:55.761
are sophisticated.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.102
There are web cams outside.

35:58.103 --> 36:01.115
Our approach was streamed
to an anonymous I.P. Address.

36:01.116 --> 36:03.155
That same I.P. Accessed
your daughter's web site.

36:03.156 --> 36:04.396
And you can't trace it?

36:04.397 --> 36:06.470
It was routed
across four continents.

36:06.471 --> 36:07.909
We're not optimistic.

36:07.910 --> 36:09.482
What about Roger Henson?

36:10.787 --> 36:13.264
He was shot to death

36:13.265 --> 36:14.602
after being tortured at length

36:14.603 --> 36:16.174
by someone who knew
what they were doing.

36:17.617 --> 36:19.154
His fingernails
were pulled off.

36:19.155 --> 36:20.459
I don't understand.

36:20.460 --> 36:21.900
Henson was working
for the kidnappers.

36:21.901 --> 36:24.610
Why would they torture him?

36:24.611 --> 36:27.288
I don't know.

36:27.289 --> 36:28.726
Well, then what do you think?

36:28.727 --> 36:30.736
What is your best guess as to
what this means for Alexis,

36:30.737 --> 36:32.207
for the girls?

36:32.208 --> 36:33.981
It means getting them back

36:33.982 --> 36:35.821
may be
a little more complicated.

36:44.626 --> 36:47.703
Were you crying in there?

36:47.704 --> 36:49.010
I thought the running water

36:49.011 --> 36:51.820
would cover it up.

36:51.821 --> 36:54.833
We'll be all right, Sara.

36:54.834 --> 36:56.808
I thought this was
all about the money.

36:56.809 --> 36:59.887
But these people speak arabic.

36:59.888 --> 37:02.866
My father is a hated man
back in Egypt.

37:05.979 --> 37:07.684
We need to get out of here.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.693
The only way out
is through that door,

37:09.694 --> 37:11.667
and it's locked.

37:14.848 --> 37:18.528
Hey, are those Bobby pins?

37:34.963 --> 37:38.977
There are hopeful signs
here, Castle.

37:38.978 --> 37:41.924
They've gone out of their way
not to harm the girls.

37:41.925 --> 37:43.932
They want them alive.

37:43.933 --> 37:45.973
That'll give us time
to track down

37:45.974 --> 37:47.547
whoever's behind this.

37:49.923 --> 37:51.731
How?

37:53.939 --> 37:55.746
Our main suspect is dead,

37:55.747 --> 37:58.156
the only thing Stevens Knew
was where the farmhouse is,

37:58.157 --> 38:01.168
and...

38:01.169 --> 38:04.046
we have no idea
who we're looking for.

38:04.047 --> 38:07.226
The FBI is searching
the farm for evidence.

38:07.227 --> 38:09.267
They're canvassing
the area for witnesses

38:09.268 --> 38:11.276
that might have seen
whoever was on the property.

38:11.277 --> 38:13.284
All of which is just
another way of saying

38:13.285 --> 38:15.861
that we're back to square one.

38:17.100 --> 38:20.981
Won't be the first time.

38:20.982 --> 38:23.191
We're gonna solve this, Castle.

38:23.192 --> 38:25.232
We will find a way.

38:25.233 --> 38:27.141
"We've done it before
with less to go on."

38:27.142 --> 38:29.014
You know who told me that?

38:30.756 --> 38:33.164
I did...

38:33.165 --> 38:35.241
in a fit
of irrational optimism.

38:36.679 --> 38:38.085
Castle, go see your mom.

38:38.086 --> 38:40.628
Get some rest.
Come back in the morning.

38:40.629 --> 38:42.268
No one is giving up here.

38:42.269 --> 38:44.242
No, I-I can't. I'm...

38:44.243 --> 38:47.289
Here's a decaf.

38:47.290 --> 38:49.298
It's for the road.

38:52.678 --> 38:55.154
Thank you.

39:06.299 --> 39:08.239
It's been hours now.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.443
My dad taught me how to do this

39:09.444 --> 39:10.917
when he was researching
for one of his books.

39:10.918 --> 39:12.825
He actually bought a door
for us to practice on.

39:12.826 --> 39:14.197
This was recently?

39:14.198 --> 39:16.004
I was 10.

39:16.005 --> 39:17.210
Oh, God.

39:17.211 --> 39:18.716
I can do this.

39:18.717 --> 39:20.424
One Bobby pin
is the torsion wrench,

39:20.425 --> 39:22.263
the other is the lockpick.

39:22.264 --> 39:25.443
I just need to be careful
not to apply too much pressure.

39:25.444 --> 39:27.283
Did you just break the hairpin?

39:27.284 --> 39:28.757
Because that's the last one.

39:28.758 --> 39:30.397
No.

39:30.398 --> 39:31.836
I got it.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.108
Oh, my God.

39:37.526 --> 39:39.366
What's out there?

39:39.367 --> 39:42.077
A hallway.
Like in an office building.

39:42.078 --> 39:43.249
I don't see anyone.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.822
What if they catch us,
then what?

39:44.823 --> 39:47.298
They want us alive.
Just remember that.

39:47.299 --> 39:49.976
Here's the plan...
We head down the hall.

39:49.977 --> 39:51.146
There has to be a way out.

39:51.147 --> 39:52.318
If it looks like
there's two ways,

39:52.319 --> 39:53.289
we split up
and double our chances

39:53.290 --> 39:54.460
that one of us makes it out.

39:54.461 --> 39:55.834
I think I'm gonna throw up.

39:55.835 --> 39:57.339
You're not going to throw up.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.380
You're going
to get out of here.

39:59.381 --> 40:01.388
Okay.

40:01.389 --> 40:02.393
Okay.

40:13.137 --> 40:14.274
Go.

40:14.275 --> 40:15.446
No, no.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.422
We talked about this. Go.

40:59.559 --> 41:01.333
Are you expecting
someone to Skype you?

41:01.334 --> 41:02.503
No.

41:09.566 --> 41:10.502
Alexis.

41:10.503 --> 41:13.080
Daddy? Oh, my God.

41:13.081 --> 41:14.551
I tried to call 9-1-1
but it wouldn't go through.

41:14.552 --> 41:16.160
Baby, are... Are you okay?
Where are you?

41:16.161 --> 41:17.632
I don't know.

41:17.633 --> 41:19.606
Oh, no.
The phone's about to die.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.479
Um, I... We're... We're...
We're in some building.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.686
We were locked in a room
but we got out.

41:22.687 --> 41:24.358
Where? What building?

41:24.359 --> 41:25.528
What's out...
What's outside the window?

41:25.529 --> 41:27.236
Nothing. Nothing.
I can't see anything.

41:27.237 --> 41:28.410
The windows are covered up.

41:30.384 --> 41:31.654
They're coming.

41:32.860 --> 41:34.331
They're coming.
They found out we're gone.

41:34.332 --> 41:36.174
Baby, get out of there.
Get out of there now.

41:36.175 --> 41:37.512
Go! Go!

41:42.667 --> 41:44.942
Can you tell where
the call's coming from?

41:44.943 --> 41:46.650
Tracking now.

42:00.707 --> 42:01.878
This can't be right.

42:01.879 --> 42:03.250
Why? What is it?

42:08.271 --> 42:09.945
This says
that the call originated

42:09.946 --> 42:12.288
from a cell tower
in Paris, France.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.983
Help! Oh!
