00:05.241 --> 00:07.785
It's so exciting Austin
and Ally like each other.

00:07.786 --> 00:09.933
When are they gonna admit
that they wanna be together?

00:09.934 --> 00:12.235
Sometimes it's hard for people
to express their feelings.

00:12.236 --> 00:13.739
Hm.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.642
<i>♪ If you wanna run.</i>

00:15.643 --> 00:18.883
<i>♪ I'll be your road.</i>

00:19.269 --> 00:22.034
- What's the next line?
- "If you want a friend".

00:22.035 --> 00:24.393
Right. Friend.

00:24.394 --> 00:27.116
- I like that.
- You do?

00:27.117 --> 00:30.841
You don't think we should
use a stronger word?

00:30.842 --> 00:33.763
I don't know. Maybe.

00:33.764 --> 00:35.831
I just don't wanna
mess up our...

00:35.832 --> 00:37.752
Song.

00:38.111 --> 00:43.883
Yeah, I'd hate to rush into a new song and
change the great song we already have.

00:43.884 --> 00:45.895
Hey, guys.

00:45.896 --> 00:49.090
What's up? Anything new?

00:49.091 --> 00:51.233
Nope, just writing a song.

00:51.234 --> 00:54.294
So nothing's changed?

00:54.344 --> 00:56.792
Well, we finished
the third verse.

00:56.793 --> 00:59.315
So would you say that some
progress has been made

00:59.316 --> 01:04.486
and the two of you are moving
in a positive direction?

01:04.488 --> 01:09.468
Trish, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

01:10.126 --> 01:14.397
Austin, we weren't really
talking about the song.

01:14.398 --> 01:16.365
We were talking
about you and Ally.

01:16.366 --> 01:19.335
I kinda figured that out.

01:19.336 --> 01:21.103
Look, it's complicated.

01:21.104 --> 01:24.540
I really like Ally,
but I like Kira too.

01:24.541 --> 01:27.176
I just don't want
to hurt anybody.

01:27.177 --> 01:29.850
Ally, we weren't really
talking about the song.

01:29.851 --> 01:32.736
We were talking about
you and Austin.

01:32.737 --> 01:34.777
Really?

01:35.219 --> 01:38.499
Look, I know he has
feelings for me, but...

01:38.500 --> 01:40.489
For all I know, he still
wants to be with Kira.

01:40.490 --> 01:43.392
Boo-hoo! He's gonna have to
deal with this at some point.

01:43.393 --> 01:47.196
Well, I'm not sitting around waiting for
him to decide who he wants to be with.

01:47.197 --> 01:50.982
My mom's coming home from Africa
today, and I wanna focus on her.

01:50.983 --> 01:53.678
Good for you. Never
wait on a guy.

01:53.679 --> 01:56.506
Actually, never wait on anybody.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.375
That's why I'm a
terrible waitress.

01:59.376 --> 02:02.111
I'm gonna forget about the
whole Austin thing for now.

02:02.112 --> 02:05.348
Honestly, I'm so over it.

02:05.349 --> 02:10.318
What do you think they're
talking about in there?

02:10.320 --> 02:11.650
You hear anything?

02:11.651 --> 02:14.831
No, it's really quiet.

02:17.494 --> 02:18.967
You hear anything?

02:18.968 --> 02:22.148
No, it's really quiet.

02:28.733 --> 02:31.835
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,

02:31.836 --> 02:34.970

02:52.301 --> 02:55.336

03:23.210 --> 03:25.010
More to the right.

03:25.011 --> 03:27.445
Ooh, if I go any more to
the right, I'm gonna fall.

03:27.446 --> 03:31.383
I know, that's why I
said more to the right.

03:31.384 --> 03:33.920
I love all these gifts
my mom sent from Africa.

03:33.921 --> 03:36.935
But the skirt's a little tight.

03:36.936 --> 03:39.215
That's because it's a doormat.

03:39.216 --> 03:43.787
Clearly, you're not up on the
latest fashions in Africa.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.264
Ally?!

03:45.265 --> 03:48.085
Welcome home, mom!

03:48.909 --> 03:50.827
I missed you so much.

03:50.828 --> 03:54.100
Oh, I missed you too, honey.

03:54.101 --> 03:57.601
Why are you wearing a doormat?

03:57.602 --> 04:01.537
Clearly, you're not up on the
latest African fashions.

04:01.538 --> 04:04.435
Austin, it's so nice
to finally meet you.

04:04.436 --> 04:05.452
Oh!

04:05.453 --> 04:08.645
And I'm so excited that you're gonna
perform at my book-signing party.

04:08.646 --> 04:10.714
I can't wait to play
the Jungle Cafe!

04:10.715 --> 04:13.783
It's part-cafe, part-jungle!

04:13.784 --> 04:17.264
Ally told me you're funny.

04:17.588 --> 04:19.421
What'd Ally say about me?

04:19.422 --> 04:21.404
She said that...

04:21.404 --> 04:23.022
Your name is Dez.

04:23.023 --> 04:25.123
Awesome!

04:25.462 --> 04:27.697
Thanks, Ally.

04:27.698 --> 04:30.501
Trish! Oh, you look great!

04:30.502 --> 04:32.702
Tell me, where are you
working this week?

04:32.703 --> 04:36.765
- At the kennel, Scooping Poop.
- Ooh, fantastic!

04:36.766 --> 04:39.743
I've got gifts for everyone.

04:39.744 --> 04:41.972
Copies of my new book.

04:41.973 --> 04:44.313
Oh, thanks.

04:44.749 --> 04:48.049
Oh, where are the gifts?

04:48.507 --> 04:52.741
Well, we're gonna get going. I'm sure
you and your mom wanna catch up.

04:52.742 --> 04:55.759
Can you sign this for me? It'll
be worth more when I sell it.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.046
I mean, read it.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.387
Bye, Trish.

05:01.375 --> 05:04.271
Mom, I have so much to tell you.

05:04.272 --> 05:08.516
Well, why don't you start with the
budding romance between you and Austin?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.497
What?!

05:11.583 --> 05:15.020
Oh, it is so obvious
that he likes you.

05:15.021 --> 05:20.094
The way he pumped up his chest and
flared his nostrils and bared his teeth.

05:20.095 --> 05:22.559
You mean smiled?

05:22.560 --> 05:26.215
It is classic gorilla
love behavior.

05:26.216 --> 05:30.326
Austin and I do like each
other, but it's complicated.

05:30.327 --> 05:33.198
I think he still has
feelings for another girl.

05:33.199 --> 05:36.710
- You wanna talk about it?
- Thanks, mom. But I'm good.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.278
I've got my music,
I've got you here.

05:39.279 --> 05:42.495
- I don't have time for boy drama.
- Good for you.

05:42.496 --> 05:44.486
Let's go have a nice lunch.

05:44.487 --> 05:46.555
I need to do
something civilized.

05:46.556 --> 05:50.770
You have no idea what it's like
hanging around apes for a year.

05:50.771 --> 05:52.872
I think I have some idea.

05:52.873 --> 05:56.533
I've been hanging around Dez.

05:57.746 --> 05:59.666
What?

06:01.000 --> 06:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:08.351 --> 06:12.154
Austin, you need to
make a decision.

06:12.155 --> 06:14.156
I know, but it's hard.

06:14.157 --> 06:16.425
I like Ally, but
Kira's great too.

06:16.426 --> 06:20.396
No, I'm talking about the pizza.
Sausage or mushroom?

06:20.397 --> 06:23.997
You need to make a decision.

06:24.267 --> 06:26.410
Hey, there's Kira.

06:26.411 --> 06:29.094
I don't know what to say to her.
Maybe she won't notice...

06:29.095 --> 06:31.541
Kira! Over here!

06:31.542 --> 06:33.242
Dez, I didn't want
her to see me.

06:33.243 --> 06:36.723
Ooh, never mind! Forget it!

06:40.070 --> 06:43.000
Hey, Kira. Listen, I've
been meaning to...

06:43.001 --> 06:45.156
Call? I know.

06:45.157 --> 06:47.124
I would have, but I'm
still trying to...

06:47.125 --> 06:49.963
Figure things out? I know.

06:49.964 --> 06:51.215
I just wanna tell you that I...

06:51.216 --> 06:54.564
Been acting like a doof? I know.

06:54.565 --> 06:57.191
I was gonna say I'm sorry.

06:57.192 --> 07:00.202
Look, Austin, I thought
we had something.

07:00.203 --> 07:06.103
But if you think you should be
with Ally, just let me know.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.411
You mean right now?

07:09.412 --> 07:11.812
Bye, Austin.

07:15.218 --> 07:17.355
I don't know how
I'm gonna decide.

07:17.356 --> 07:20.735
You just have to ask yourself
one simple question.

07:20.736 --> 07:22.905
When you look inside
your heart...

07:22.906 --> 07:27.706
Do you see yourself with
sausage or mushroom?

07:36.239 --> 07:39.700
Oh, honey. You are so talented.

07:39.701 --> 07:43.600
I wish you didn't have stage fright,
so other people could see that.

07:43.601 --> 07:45.253
I'm working on it.

07:45.254 --> 07:47.898
Your dad and I just
know you can do it.

07:47.899 --> 07:49.720
How is he doing, by the way?

07:49.721 --> 07:51.032
He's good.

07:51.033 --> 07:53.373
He joined an extreme
couponing club.

07:53.374 --> 07:55.691
Keeps him busy.

07:55.692 --> 08:01.094
You know, we may have split up,
but I still want him to be happy.

08:01.095 --> 08:05.546
Hi, Penny. I read your
book and I am not happy.

08:05.547 --> 08:08.291
- What are you talking about?
- Chapter nine.

08:08.292 --> 08:10.518
Chester, the cheap gorilla.

08:10.519 --> 08:12.402
He's stingy with his bananas.

08:12.403 --> 08:14.321
That's obviously me.

08:14.322 --> 08:15.986
Don't be silly.

08:15.987 --> 08:19.442
No, Chester is a real gorilla
I observed in the wild.

08:19.443 --> 08:22.445
Nobody's gonna think it's you.

08:22.446 --> 08:24.931
- We read your book.
- Loved it.

08:24.932 --> 08:26.054
Hey, Mr. Dawson.

08:26.055 --> 08:31.955
That cheap gorilla in the book
is supposed to be you, right?

08:32.005 --> 08:35.374
- Your book was so inspiring.
- That's why I wrote it.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.904
We have so much that we
can learn from animals.

08:37.905 --> 08:42.975
Like how they act on instinct, instead
of over thinking things they way we do.

08:42.976 --> 08:47.324
Pfft, no more over thinking for me.
From now on, I'm gonna under-think.

08:47.325 --> 08:52.124
Not really sure how to do that,
but I'm not gonna think about it.

08:52.125 --> 08:55.315
Austin, I think my mom's
point is to not let over

08:55.316 --> 08:58.104
thinking stop you from doing
what you really wanna do.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.212
Yeah! Like me.

09:00.213 --> 09:02.927
I was gonna get fired
from my job tomorrow,

09:02.928 --> 09:07.377
but your book inspired me so
much, I'm gonna get fired today!

09:07.378 --> 09:10.918
That's the spirit! Sort of.

09:11.078 --> 09:13.929
You know what I've always wanted to do?
Run a Marathon.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.983
And I'm gonna do it. Right now!

09:16.984 --> 09:21.064
You go, Dez! Don't
think, just do!

09:21.387 --> 09:24.343
Maybe that's why I
have stage fright.

09:24.344 --> 09:25.829
Because I think too much.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.851
You gotta get outta
your head, honey.

09:27.852 --> 09:29.996
You're right, mom.

09:29.997 --> 09:33.346
It's time for me to
face my biggest fear.

09:33.347 --> 09:35.471
I'm gonna perform on stage.

09:35.472 --> 09:39.238
Ally! We can perform a duet together
at your mom's book release party.

09:39.239 --> 09:41.672
Ally, that would be amazing!

09:41.673 --> 09:45.213
- I'm gonna do it!
- Yeah!

09:51.151 --> 09:53.085
I thought you were
running a Marathon.

09:53.086 --> 09:58.024
I made it to the food court, and then I
got inspired to eat this parfait instead.

09:58.025 --> 10:02.945
Couldn't have done it without you, Ms.
Dawson.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.684
Dez, I made my decision
on who I wanna be with.

10:10.685 --> 10:14.073
- Really?
- Yeah. Ally's mom inspired me.

10:14.074 --> 10:16.948
Animals don't think,
they just do.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.693
So I made my decision.

10:18.694 --> 10:20.428
It's Kira.

10:20.429 --> 10:22.469
Really?

10:22.695 --> 10:25.642
I had to stop over thinking
about me and Ally.

10:25.643 --> 10:28.154
Like, what if it
doesn't work out?

10:28.155 --> 10:30.098
It could ruin our friendship.

10:30.099 --> 10:32.291
What if I just over
complicate things?

10:32.292 --> 10:36.095
She'll lose focus on
overcoming her stage fright.

10:36.096 --> 10:39.098
What if I go on tour?
Would she come with me?

10:39.099 --> 10:42.201
Would she stay and
work at the store?

10:42.202 --> 10:43.499
What if...

10:43.500 --> 10:48.510
The real Ally was replaced by her
evil twin from another dimension?

10:48.511 --> 10:51.528
I'd be writing songs
with an alien.

10:51.529 --> 10:54.243
Anyway, that's why Ally and
I shouldn't be together.

10:54.244 --> 10:58.055
Well, I'm just glad you
didn't over think it.

10:58.056 --> 11:00.758
Besides, Kira's great.

11:00.759 --> 11:04.023
I made up my mind. I'm gonna
ask Kira to be my girlfriend.

11:04.024 --> 11:05.881
I was really hoping
you'd pick Ally.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.293
I think you're right
for each other.

11:08.294 --> 11:11.654
And I made 500 of these.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.540
Ally?

11:36.541 --> 11:39.749
I got your message
about Austin and Kira.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.512
I'm not sure how you're feeling.

11:41.513 --> 11:45.715
So if you're sad, I got
frozen yogurt and tissues.

11:45.716 --> 11:50.654
And if you're mad, I got a dartboard
with Austin's face on it.

11:50.655 --> 11:53.323
I'm not sad or mad.

11:53.324 --> 11:56.862
But I am hungry. I'm
keeping the frozen yogurt.

11:56.863 --> 12:00.263
Wow, you're handling this
better than I thought.

12:00.264 --> 12:03.144
Well, I was upset at first.

12:03.145 --> 12:06.403
But Austin's still my friend.
That hasn't changed.

12:06.404 --> 12:10.102
Well, at least now you don't have to worry
about dating him while you work together.

12:10.103 --> 12:12.309
Now there's only one thing
I have to worry about.

12:12.310 --> 12:14.311
Singing on stage.

12:14.312 --> 12:16.380
Why did I say I'd do that?

12:16.381 --> 12:18.043
Ally, you're ready.

12:18.044 --> 12:19.550
And I'll be there
cheering for you.

12:19.551 --> 12:23.554
Louder than anyone
who might be booing.

12:23.555 --> 12:26.075
Thanks, Trish.

12:30.628 --> 12:33.009
Be your girlfriend?

12:33.010 --> 12:34.857
I don't know, Austin.

12:34.858 --> 12:36.776
I'm sorry it took me so
long to figure it out.

12:36.777 --> 12:38.860
But now I know how I feel.

12:38.861 --> 12:41.863
Yeah, tomorrow you could
decide you wanna be with Ally.

12:41.864 --> 12:43.487
You change your mind a lot.

12:43.488 --> 12:45.347
No, I don't.

12:45.348 --> 12:48.723
Can I get the turkey
burger instead?

12:48.724 --> 12:51.426
You know what? This'll be fine.

12:51.427 --> 12:53.709
Can you blame me
for having doubts?

12:53.710 --> 12:55.577
So you're saying no?

12:55.578 --> 12:57.515
I didn't say that.

12:57.516 --> 12:58.814
So it's a yes?!

12:58.815 --> 13:00.749
I didn't say that either.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.568
Look, Kira. I wanna be with you.

13:03.569 --> 13:09.469
If you don't wanna be with me, I get it.
Just let me know.

13:11.894 --> 13:13.895
You mean right now?

13:13.896 --> 13:15.697
I need time to think about it.

13:15.698 --> 13:17.271
Right.

13:17.272 --> 13:19.372
Got it.

13:19.602 --> 13:22.182
How about now?

13:23.663 --> 13:27.105
<i>♪ I'll be your shoulder.</i>

13:27.106 --> 13:29.126
<i>♪ If you wanna laugh.</i>

13:29.127 --> 13:32.427
<i>♪ I'll be your smile.</i>

13:32.782 --> 13:35.364

13:35.365 --> 13:38.370

13:40.467 --> 13:42.748

13:42.749 --> 13:44.330
Boo!

13:44.331 --> 13:46.485
- You stink!
- Get off the stage!

13:46.486 --> 13:48.188
Boo!

13:48.189 --> 13:49.576
- Okay, wait wait wait!
- Boo!

13:49.577 --> 13:50.823
Okay.

13:50.824 --> 13:52.691
How is this supposed to help?

13:52.692 --> 13:55.842
We're getting you used to performing
under the worst possible conditions.

13:55.843 --> 13:57.102
If you can sing through this,

13:57.103 --> 13:59.957
you can get through singing at
the Jungle Cafe tomorrow night.

13:59.958 --> 14:03.174
I think I'm ready. I don't need
to get hit with any more trash.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.455
Honestly...

14:05.706 --> 14:06.913
Dez!

14:06.914 --> 14:08.762
What?! You said no more trash.

14:08.763 --> 14:11.778
That was a beach ball.

14:11.779 --> 14:17.383
Honey, I just wanna tell you how proud I
am you're finally conquering your fear.

14:17.384 --> 14:19.794
I got you a little present.

14:19.795 --> 14:22.015
Aw! Oh...

14:22.315 --> 14:25.059
A charm bracelet with
a golden microphone.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.460
Thanks, dad.

14:28.729 --> 14:32.809
Would a cheap gorilla
buy you that?

14:42.990 --> 14:47.153
I just wanna thank you all so much
for coming to my book release party.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.782
Enjoy the hors d'oeuvres.
They're free.

14:49.783 --> 14:52.752
I'm sure Chester the cheap
gorilla would appreciate that.

14:52.753 --> 14:54.973
Hilarious!

14:56.884 --> 15:00.660
I wrote this book to
inspire people...

15:00.661 --> 15:02.528
Hey, Ally. You ready for this?

15:02.529 --> 15:04.090
I think so.

15:04.091 --> 15:05.776
I'm proud of you.

15:05.777 --> 15:08.357
Thanks, Austin.

15:14.441 --> 15:17.261
Let's go set up.

15:17.470 --> 15:20.136
We've got a very special
treat for you tonight.

15:20.137 --> 15:24.213
Singing with Austin Moon
is my daughter Ally.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.452
Her father and I
couldn't be more proud.

15:26.453 --> 15:29.873
Friends... Austin and Ally!

15:35.696 --> 15:37.516
Where's Ally?

15:37.517 --> 15:40.152
I don't know. She just took off.

15:40.153 --> 15:44.211
Why would Ally take off? Doesn't she
know she's supposed to perform?

15:44.212 --> 15:46.972
So unprofessional.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.765
Um, there's gonna be a slight
delay in the entertainment.

15:55.766 --> 16:01.058
So keep enjoying your hors
d'oeuvres and I'll be right back.

16:01.059 --> 16:03.872
- I'll go with you to talk to Ally.
- You're always there for her.

16:03.873 --> 16:07.113
Let me handle this one.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.641
Austin, maybe you
should sing something.

16:09.642 --> 16:10.993
Not without Ally.

16:10.994 --> 16:13.034
Well...

16:13.406 --> 16:18.086
Don't worry, Mr. Dawson.
We'll handle this.

16:20.086 --> 16:24.386
We will now read a chapter from Dr.
Penny Dawson's book.

16:24.387 --> 16:28.783
"Chester's stinginess was an
embarrassment to the other gorillas".

16:28.784 --> 16:31.244
Aw, come on!

16:40.871 --> 16:42.575
I'm sorry I let you down, mom.

16:42.576 --> 16:45.457
Oh, honey. You could
never let me down.

16:45.458 --> 16:48.202
I really thought I was
gonna do it this time.

16:48.203 --> 16:51.862
But as soon as I heard you
announce my name, I just panicked.

16:51.863 --> 16:54.263
Oh, sweetie.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.382
Can I tell you a story?

16:58.383 --> 17:02.992
Is it about a giraffe
who's afraid of heights?

17:02.993 --> 17:07.086
This one is about
a girl who was...

17:07.087 --> 17:12.007
Shy and insecure when her
mom left for Africa.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.367
But when she returned,

17:14.368 --> 17:20.269
she found this confident, beautiful
young woman who was capable of doing...

17:20.762 --> 17:24.422
Anything she put her mind to.

17:25.015 --> 17:27.916
What's your biggest fear?

17:27.917 --> 17:33.818
Dez is gonna marry Trish and
they're gonna wanna live with me.

17:34.958 --> 17:38.798
I meant about your stage fright.

17:39.629 --> 17:42.627
That I'm gonna fail and
I'll never be a performer.

17:42.628 --> 17:47.732
So you try, and if you fail,
you get up and you try again.

17:47.733 --> 17:52.175
But you won't fail forever
because you're way too talented.

17:52.176 --> 17:53.976
You're right.

17:53.977 --> 17:57.037
I can't stop trying.

17:58.419 --> 18:01.201
I'm gonna give it another shot.

18:01.202 --> 18:04.202
- Thanks, mom.
- Oh.

18:07.708 --> 18:09.988
Hey, Ally.

18:09.993 --> 18:13.233
I'll let you two talk.

18:17.810 --> 18:21.103
Remember when we sat at this piano
and wrote our first song together?

18:21.104 --> 18:22.864
Yeah.

18:22.865 --> 18:25.639
We've come a long way.

18:25.640 --> 18:29.276
You've come a long way. You were
a different person back then.

18:29.277 --> 18:35.177
That Ally couldn't have even gotten
on stage, but this Ally can.

18:39.222 --> 18:42.282
Please don't pet me.

18:42.544 --> 18:45.989
Thanks for coming over. You
really didn't have to do this.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.912
Hey, you're always there for me.

18:47.913 --> 18:53.492
No, really. You didn't have to do this. I
talked to my mom and I'm ready to perform.

18:53.493 --> 18:55.833
But thanks.

19:00.698 --> 19:02.748
Let's do this.

19:02.749 --> 19:05.029
Let's go.

19:11.906 --> 19:15.026
"And the lion roared".

19:15.936 --> 19:21.836
"From the safety of the nearby rock
ledge, the baby Meerkat watched".

19:22.943 --> 19:24.753
Meer... Kat.

19:24.754 --> 19:27.154
Meer... Kat.

19:27.736 --> 19:31.608
Sorry, I don't know
what a Meerkat is.

19:31.609 --> 19:37.509
Thank you, Dez and Trish. Thank
you for bringing my book to life.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.993
I'm sorry for the
delay, friends.

19:40.994 --> 19:45.395
Now for a very special duet,
please help me welcome...

19:45.396 --> 19:48.096
Austin and Ally.

21:47.559 --> 21:49.876
I always knew you could do it.

21:49.877 --> 21:51.778
I'm glad you were
up there with me.

21:51.779 --> 21:55.515
That was incredible! I feel
like I can do anything.

21:55.516 --> 21:57.371
I know I can do anything...

21:57.372 --> 22:00.792
So long as I'm with you.

22:13.116 --> 22:16.716
Austin... I thought about it.

22:16.804 --> 22:20.464
Yes, I'll be your girlfriend.

22:31.619 --> 22:33.686
I'm so proud of our little girl.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.788
She was amazing tonight.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.332
She always been so talented.

22:38.333 --> 22:41.513
She gets that from me.

22:43.831 --> 22:45.181
Hey.

22:45.182 --> 22:47.221
Thanks for naming the
gorilla after me.

22:47.222 --> 22:50.664
- You're not mad anymore?
- Not at all.

22:50.665 --> 22:54.302
Oh, would you like me to
sign it Chester or Lester?

22:54.303 --> 22:58.288
You know what? Never
mind, I'll do both.
