ROSEANNE: Anyone
down there, Jackie?

00:14.982 --> 00:16.750
This is spooky, Roseanne.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.286
I think there may
be rats in here.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.220
ROSEANNE: Good.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.823
Tell them their
queen has arrived.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.826
I don't think anyone's
in here, Roseanne.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.561
Maybe we should have
made an appointment.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.197
Yeah, well, if she's
such a good fortuneteller,

00:29.230 --> 00:30.598
she should have
known we were coming.

Zaftig bids you enter.

00:38.539 --> 00:42.009
I gotta see this.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.511
How you doing?

00:43.544 --> 00:48.082
Madame Zaftig sees all,
hears all, and knows all.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.883
Yeah, I want to
know my future.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.253
Start with who I'm gonna marry.

00:52.286 --> 00:55.623
Is Roseanne gonna
marry Paul McCartney?

00:55.656 --> 00:57.691
Of course I am.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.794
And every night we'll be like
Prince Charming and Cinderella.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.696
And I'll be Cinderella.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.898
I see a man.

01:04.932 --> 01:08.035
The man of your future.

[tv playing]

01:09.470 --> 01:11.539
You know, I was a pretty good
wrestler in junior high school.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.474
Coach used to call me
damaging Dan Conner.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.844

to that boring story again.

Great money, forget it.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.150
You're not gonna get it.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.888
Be a lot of guys bidding.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.625
And they're all
better than you, I bet.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.060
- Hey, I'm pretty good!
- You are not.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.795
- Yes, I am.
- You're not either.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.696
I am the best.

01:35.729 --> 01:36.764
You're the worst.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.532
I am the drywall
master of the universe!

Ahhh!

Ooh.

He's going hard!

01:54.982 --> 01:56.250
He's gonna push!

01:56.284 --> 01:58.352
You think this is a magic
kingdom where you just

01:58.386 --> 02:00.254
sit up here on your throne.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.055
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

And you think everything gets
done by some wonderful wizard.

I'll fix dinner.

do you and your fat wife

Wow, so that's
what Paul McCartney

OK, now tell me my whole future.

Madame Zaftig a dollar.

Oh, gross, I hate boys.

04:33.073 --> 04:36.344
That, my dear, will change.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.845
Well, OK.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.748
How many men did you
date before we met?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.651
Well, do you mean dated
at all, or dated seriously?

04:43.684 --> 04:44.918
I mean seriously.

04:44.952 --> 04:45.819
OK.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.589
I'd have to say just a few.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.890
Good.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.092
It's not that I mind if you
slept with a lot of guys.

04:52.125 --> 04:52.993
Oh, well, slept with.

04:53.026 --> 04:53.861
Haha, well.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.134
That's not what you asked me.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.971
No, I guess it wasn't.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.406
Don't worry.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.274
It's not that many.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.445
I'd say three a year.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.080
Since you were what, 18?

05:16.249 --> 05:17.017
OK, we'll go with that.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.457
Well.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.494
Fred, it's not that many.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.329
Three a year for 20 years is 60.

05:34.001 --> 05:38.606
God, I don't even
know 60 people.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.941
Well, I didn't
know all of them.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.014
Jackie, mom and me
were just talking.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.382
Well, just-- just
a second, Roseanne.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.751
There's something I
want to tell my mother.

05:50.784 --> 05:54.422
Mom, um, I'm pregnant.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.089
I went out with a
guy I hardly know.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.625
We had sex for hours,
and I got pregnant.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.467
And I'm not gonna marry him.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.636
I'm keeping the baby,
and if it's a girl,

06:08.669 --> 06:11.672
I'm naming it Gidget.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.106
What is it, Jackie?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.876
Well, I just wanted to tell
you that I've been thinking

06:15.909 --> 06:17.545
about it, and I've
come to the conclusion

06:17.578 --> 06:19.312
that it's never coming out.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.281
Never.

06:21.314 --> 06:25.986
I'm gonna be a 70-year-old woman
carrying a 30-year-old baby.

06:26.019 --> 06:29.056
Jackie, you're only
three days overdue.

06:29.089 --> 06:33.594
I have a three-day-old
child inside of me.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.528
Look at me!

06:39.132 --> 06:41.101
It's huge!

06:41.134 --> 06:43.671
Yes, but you have
a very pretty face.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.639
[laughter] Hey, look it.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.140
What is that?

06:47.174 --> 06:49.643
What's-- why is it like that?

06:49.677 --> 06:51.144
Ow!

06:51.178 --> 06:55.783
Roseanne, how is this
going to come out of this?

06:55.816 --> 06:57.050
Relax, Jackie.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.286
These have been coming
out of those for millions

06:59.319 --> 07:00.488
of millions of years.

07:00.521 --> 07:04.191
You know, muscles
stretch, bones break.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.460
I'm sick of being pregnant.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.261
Well, maybe it's like a turkey.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.698
You know, when this
comes out, it's ready.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.566
Oh, cut it out.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.834
I do.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.603
By the power vested in me
by the state of Illinois,

07:15.636 --> 07:18.839
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.774
You may kiss the bride.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.442
Just let me
switch sides first.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.050
Stop looking, Roseanne.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.384
This is my future.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.020
Hey, I paid for these, Jackie.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.088
I own your future.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.758
I'm sick of you bossing
me around, Roseanne.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.426
Look, I'll give you
Billy Schmitt's ID

07:39.459 --> 07:40.761
bracelet if you let
me boss you around

07:40.794 --> 07:41.795
for the rest of your life.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.630
OK.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.501
Oh, come on, this guy is great.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.336
All those little
irritating things you do,

07:49.369 --> 07:51.805
he thinks they're cute.

07:51.839 --> 07:55.042
He walked in here and
he gave me an ultimatum.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.844
He told me to quit the force.

07:56.877 --> 07:57.911
Well, so what?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.046
I've been telling
you to quit the force

07:59.079 --> 08:00.247
since the day you started.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.649
Yeah, and I've been
trying to break up with you,

08:01.682 --> 08:05.085
but you won't seem to go away.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.054
Look, becoming a
cop is something

08:07.087 --> 08:08.856
I worked very, very hard for.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.858
What would you do
if Dan just demanded

08:10.891 --> 08:12.826
that you give up the house,
and the job, and the kids?

08:16.897 --> 08:19.099
I am gonna do exactly
what you would do.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.169
You would never let a man
tell you how to run your life.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.271
I want somebody who'll love
and support me no matter

08:24.304 --> 08:26.439
what, just like
Dan does for you.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.775
Are you insane?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.509
Do you know how many years
I had to put into Danny?

08:29.543 --> 08:33.313
You think he came out
of a box like that?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.183
Now you could put those
same years into Gary.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.818
I'm telling you, he is
the perfect guy for you.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.887
No, Roseanne, he's
the perfect guy for you.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.555
You just want him to
settle down and take care

08:41.589 --> 08:43.023
of your flaky sister
so you don't have

08:43.056 --> 08:44.391
to worry about her anymore.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.826
Well, that's OK, you
don't have to worry

08:45.859 --> 08:50.564
about her anymore, because
she's gonna be just fine.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.132
This takes a
little more effort

08:52.165 --> 08:54.267
than a high school romance.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.404
You know, I lived
with Fisher, Roseanne.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.707
Well, so maybe
that's your problem.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.043
Maybe you and Fisher spend
too much time together.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.179
I never would have moved in
with no guy so damn fast.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.783
Maybe you wouldn't, but
this isn't you, it's me.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.885
And there's a real easy
way to tell us apart.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.253
You, me.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.726
You, me!

09:23.296 --> 09:24.965
What is your problem?

09:24.998 --> 09:26.133
You.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.036
You, you are my problem.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.070
Oh, what I'd do now?

09:30.103 --> 09:32.305
Same thing as you
always do, Roseanne.

09:32.339 --> 09:36.043
You sit up there
on your pedestal.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.277
Yeah.

09:37.310 --> 09:41.882
Act like some big, high
and mighty, self-righteous,

09:41.915 --> 09:45.585
pedestal-type person.

09:45.619 --> 09:50.290
And you poo poo
everything in my life.

09:50.323 --> 09:54.594
Yeah, and you go right
for your addictive behavior.

09:54.628 --> 09:58.165
Hah, because you
cannot handle conflict.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.066
That is a whole thing.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.400
You cannot handle conflict.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.103
Remember, we saw that
whole thing on Oprah.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.939
People who cannot handle
conflicts, right away,

10:05.973 --> 10:08.208
they run for the alcohol.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.911
Well, have another shot
of pancake, Roseanne.

10:15.883 --> 10:16.884
Take your best shot.

10:19.687 --> 10:23.056
[interposing voices]

10:23.090 --> 10:26.927
You know that I would
just knock your lights out.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.263
Well, then, go ahead.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.166
Make my day.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.634
Ha.

10:34.668 --> 10:39.239
[whining]

10:39.272 --> 10:40.140
Ow!

10:40.173 --> 10:41.108
Ow!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.109
Ow, ow!

10:42.142 --> 10:42.943
Ow!

10:46.146 --> 10:48.515
[yelling]

10:53.186 --> 10:53.987
Let me up!

10:56.690 --> 10:57.490
Excuse me.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.461
Is this like a sex thing?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.235
That's it, I'm not
making any more calls.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.602
You do the rest of
the family list.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.873
I can't call people, Roseanne.

11:12.906 --> 11:13.841
Jackie, dial.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.145
I'm supposed to
be in mourning.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.113
Well, then, wear a veil over
your face while you do it.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.454
Can't.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.722
Auntie Barbara?

11:28.756 --> 11:30.257
It's Jackie.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.892
Jackie.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.426
I'm fine.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.527
Fine.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.362
I'm fine.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.933
I have some bad news.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.603
Dad is not with us anymore.

11:43.636 --> 11:47.808
I said Dad has passed away.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.944
He's passed away.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.946
Dad is gone.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.916
Dad's dead.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.417
He's dead!

11:57.450 --> 12:00.420
No, dead!

12:00.453 --> 12:03.423
Dead!

12:03.456 --> 12:06.493
He's fine, he sends his love.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.394
Bye.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.396
I am not doing that again.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.330
You can't make me.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.773
Well, now, Ms.
Harris, you're looking

12:19.807 --> 12:21.474
after your nephew DJ, yes?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.442
Yes.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.478
I am his only
surviving relative.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.547
I mean, that will speak to him.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.917
I had to bring him
to you, Doctor,

12:29.950 --> 12:33.320
because DJ has become
so unmanageable lately.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.289
Well, why don't we
bring DJ in right now?

12:40.293 --> 12:43.696
986 tiles on the
waiting room floor, 986.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.999
Yes.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.067
That's just like his mother.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.701
Hello, DJ.

12:48.735 --> 12:49.837
She's not the same.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.371
They say she's the same,
but she's not the same.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.440
Oh, dear, he just
repeats that to himself.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.275
No one knows what it means.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.911
Not the same at
all, very different.

12:57.945 --> 13:01.348
Well now, why don't we
start with DJ's family?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.884
Oh, DJ's family was wonderful.

13:03.917 --> 13:07.387
It was happiness
times joy, plus love.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.759
You stand on the
end of the board.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.594
I'll jump on it and
shoot you in the air, OK?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.428
OK.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.499
Ready?

13:19.532 --> 13:22.469
Ready.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.370
Freeze right there.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.075
What'd I tell you about
killing your brother

13:28.108 --> 13:28.909
in the living room?

13:32.846 --> 13:34.214
This is a pretty picture.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.416
is this the one for school?

13:36.449 --> 13:39.953
There's Daddy, and me,
and Becky, and you.

13:39.987 --> 13:40.854
Where's Darlene?

13:40.888 --> 13:43.023
Right there.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.391
That looks like
a bunch of flowers.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.292
I know.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.259
That's her grave.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.834
I just had some questions
about God and stuff.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.570
Well, so why didn't you come
to us if you had questions?

13:57.604 --> 14:00.240
You know, there's no two better
people to answer your questions

14:00.273 --> 14:02.943
than me and your dad.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.945
- OK, what religion are we?
- I have no idea.

14:04.978 --> 14:05.778
Dan?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.851
Well, my family's
Pentecostal on my mom's side,

14:11.885 --> 14:13.753
Baptist on my dad's.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.488
Your mom's mom was Lutheran.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.724
Her dad was Jewish.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.359
So what do we believe?

14:19.392 --> 14:23.663
Well, we believe
in, uh, being good.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.467
So basically, we're good people.

14:27.500 --> 14:32.039
Yeah, but we're
not practicing.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.441
DJ, come on, I'm walking
you to school today.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.375
Oh, no.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.678
You're not going
in that, are you?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.180
Oh, no, DJ.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.282
I wouldn't do that to you.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.418
But I would do this.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.295
Oh my, just a minute.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.796
Wait one minute here.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.266
This is for when I
kiss you goodbye.

15:11.811 --> 15:16.516
Now, this is a very delicate
area, but I just have to ask.

15:16.549 --> 15:23.957
In DJ's family, how did they
deal with the issue of sex?

15:23.991 --> 15:25.225
[barking]

15:25.258 --> 15:27.627
Wawawawawawa woowoowoowoowoowoo!
Woowooowoowoowoowooo!

15:27.660 --> 15:32.199
Woowoowoowooowoo
woowooowoowooowoo!

15:32.232 --> 15:34.534
Only in the most healthy
and appropriate ways.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.438
Ah!
Mom!

15:38.471 --> 15:39.339
Mom!

15:39.372 --> 15:40.440
Damn.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.574
She hit me.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.311
I caught him peeking
at me getting dressed.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.878
Hey, I told you
to cut that out.

15:45.912 --> 15:49.682
You told me to stop
peeking at Becky.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.652
Well, he's got me
there, Darlene.

15:52.685 --> 15:53.953
What's going on?

15:53.987 --> 15:57.024
Well, now that little
pervert's peeking at me.

15:57.057 --> 15:57.857
Why?

15:59.926 --> 16:02.462
Look, it was fun for everybody
when he was peeking at Becky.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.965
But now, someone may get hurt.
- No!

16:05.999 --> 16:07.867
OK, come here.
Darlene, go away.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.540
Darlene called me a prevert.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.045
No, you're not
a prevert, honey.

16:18.078 --> 16:18.878
You're a pervert.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.417
What are you doing downstairs?

16:24.451 --> 16:26.486
What's the matter
with your bathroom?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.921
Uh, DJ has been in
there for like an hour.

16:28.955 --> 16:29.989
Boy, he's just like you, Dan.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.658
Why don't you run a
newspaper up to him?

16:35.595 --> 16:38.698
He's got the door locked, and
it's like the third time today.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.400
Maybe I ought to go up there.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.834
Trust me, I don't
think this is the time

16:41.868 --> 16:42.935
that a boy needs his mother.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.009
What are you talking about?

16:50.043 --> 16:54.081
Um, I think I know
what she's talking about.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.084
And I think you know what
she's talking about if you just

16:57.117 --> 17:00.153
think about it for a minute.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.190
Yeah, DJ's finally got a
friend that's not imaginary.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.097
Oh my God.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.836
You don't know.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.605
He could just be
brushing his teeth,

17:18.638 --> 17:22.509
or you know, maybe he's
compulsively washing his hands,

17:22.542 --> 17:26.779
or maybe it's something totally
harmless like chronic diarrhea.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.917
Trust me, he goes in
that room because it's

17:30.950 --> 17:32.385
the only one with a lock on it.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.387
And he's in there for
like an hour at a time.

17:34.421 --> 17:38.458
Which either means he's
really, really good at it,

17:38.491 --> 17:40.227
or really, really bad at it.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.060
Oh, God.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.337
Well, I don't want you to
give him any grief about this,

17:50.370 --> 17:51.604
you know, because
you could traumatize

17:51.638 --> 17:55.342
him and turn him into a
serial killer or something.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.576
Well, don't worry.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.411
How much damage could he
do with only one free hand?

18:01.848 --> 18:08.455
You know, when I was 13,
something really embarrassing

18:08.488 --> 18:09.622
happened to me.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.125
You know, I never thought
I would get over it.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.393
What?

18:13.426 --> 18:16.929
Well, you know, the
junior high had a dance,

18:16.963 --> 18:20.233
and uh, your grandma had brought
me this real pretty white

18:20.267 --> 18:22.969
dress, you know, and in
the middle of the dance,

18:23.002 --> 18:27.574
I looked down at the
dress, and there was a, uh,

18:27.607 --> 18:30.477
very noticeable stain.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.311
What was it?

18:34.113 --> 18:37.083
Well, DJ, it seems
that, uh, I was

18:37.116 --> 18:38.951
going through what
all the girls were

18:38.985 --> 18:41.288
going through at a certain age.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.555
I was having my first period.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.456
Oh my God!

18:43.490 --> 18:44.324
I don't want to hear it!

18:44.357 --> 18:45.325
I don't want to hear it!

18:45.358 --> 18:46.259
I don't want to hear it!

18:46.293 --> 18:47.194
Whoa, whoa!

18:47.227 --> 18:48.628
What's going on?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.997
Mom told me something I
don't want to hear anymore!

18:51.030 --> 18:53.666
Well, that's no reason for you
to go running out of the room

18:53.700 --> 18:55.268
screaming like a maniac.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.170
It was about her
having her period!

18:57.204 --> 18:58.070
As you were.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.038
I don't want to hear it!

18:59.071 --> 19:00.440
I don't want to hear it!

19:04.911 --> 19:06.279
Was I an accident?

19:10.617 --> 19:11.484
No, DJ.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.586
You were a surprise.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.954
What's the difference?

19:17.924 --> 19:20.360
Mmm, well, an accident is
something that if you had to do

19:20.393 --> 19:22.595
it over again, you wouldn't.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.498
But a surprise is something
that you didn't even know

19:25.532 --> 19:26.966
you wanted till you got it.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.202
Was Darlene an accident?

19:29.236 --> 19:30.337
No, Darlene was a disaster.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.076
Darlene says I'm not
gonna be the baby anymore,

19:37.109 --> 19:40.112
so nobody's going to
pay any attention to me.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.581
Well, I'll tell
you what, honey.

19:41.614 --> 19:46.152
How about if we pay lots and
lots of attention to you?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.888
I'll be happy if
you have a baby.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.022
Oh, that's so sweet.

19:50.056 --> 19:54.861
Finally, I get a
chance to kick some butt.

19:54.894 --> 19:59.332
Well, perhaps his family
wasn't completely horrid.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.402
The problem may have stemmed
from some other cause.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.503
But what, Doctor?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.072
Why is DJ the way he is?

20:06.105 --> 20:09.075
Well, somewhere in his
past, something traumatic

20:09.108 --> 20:12.879
happened, and DJ just
split with reality.

20:12.912 --> 20:16.349
Some key incident that he
cannot resolve from his mind.

20:16.383 --> 20:20.287
They say she's the same,
but she isn't the same.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.390
If only we could
get into his head.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.825
They say she's the same,
but she isn't the same.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.061
Um--

20:29.095 --> 20:30.196
Hello?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.265
Thick, thick, medium
thick, or thin thick?

20:32.299 --> 20:33.500
Becky.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.603
Mom, will you help
me with my hair?

20:36.636 --> 20:39.038
Hey.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.239
Mom, Dad, this is Mark.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.942
Mark, these are my parents.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.076
Hi.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.345
They say she's the same
but she isn't the same.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.913
They say she's the same
but she isn't the same.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.182
They say she's the same
but she isn't the same.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.285
We may never know
what that means.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.220
They say she's the same
but she isn't the same.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.121
They say she's--

20:55.154 --> 20:59.992
[music playing]

21:00.026 --> 21:04.331
Welcome to the
tunnel of terror.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.334
Now I'm warning you,
be nice to the people.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.535
How do I look?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.036
Ahhh!

21:10.069 --> 21:10.870
Ahhh!

21:13.973 --> 21:15.742
I've got a splitting headache.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.643
You tramp!

21:16.676 --> 21:18.144
You slut!

21:18.177 --> 21:19.346
Ahhh!

21:19.379 --> 21:20.146
Ahhh!

21:22.649 --> 21:25.552
[laughter]

21:29.255 --> 21:30.122
Leave us alone.

21:30.156 --> 21:33.125
We are as God made us.

21:33.159 --> 21:39.366
[screaming]

21:43.069 --> 21:46.005
[explosion]
