made me feel better.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.339
You always make
me feel better.

09:17.382 --> 09:21.386
♪ If I could be yours
and you could be mine ♪

09:21.430 --> 09:25.042

[whimpers]

09:35.618 --> 09:37.620
[footsteps approaching]

09:39.187 --> 09:41.058
Oh, Grover.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.886
We can't get the lights
back on in Sweetie Pie.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.322
I think the whole block's out.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.719
Oh, my God.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.417
She cut the power.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.506
Wait, what? What are you talking
about? Who cut the power?

09:54.550 --> 09:56.247
The governor. As
of this morning,

09:56.291 --> 09:57.597
Greylock is no longer a part

09:57.640 --> 09:59.337
of New Hampshire.
She must have

09:59.381 --> 10:01.078
shut down our
state utilities.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.427
We're officially on our own.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.521
WILLIAM:
This blackout is unacceptable.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.262
You have a clinic
without emergency equipment.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.874
You have railroad crossings
without signal arms

10:13.917 --> 10:15.353
or safety flashers.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.529
I mean,
the whole town is in the dark.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.662
Not the whole town.Plenty of lights on
in your neighborhood.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.664
AJ:
Those fancy generators
you all have

10:21.708 --> 10:23.492
keeping your houses
nice and toasty?

10:23.535 --> 10:25.102
I-I wouldn't want your money
to get cold.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.409
You are endangering the lives
of everyone in Greylock.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.454
CORINNE:
Pump the breaks, bud.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.456
We're on it.The clinic's patients
have already

10:31.500 --> 10:33.241
been transferred to
Sacred Heart's down the road,

10:33.284 --> 10:35.635
Greylock PD is providing
flashlights and blankets

10:35.678 --> 10:37.245
to anyone
who needs them.Great.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.420
And the fire department
already put extra signs

10:38.463 --> 10:39.726
at all the railroad crossings.

10:39.769 --> 10:40.901
And I already have meetings
set up

10:40.944 --> 10:42.424
with a dozen utility companies.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.687
We're gonna get the power
back on in no time.

10:44.731 --> 10:45.688
Okay?

10:45.732 --> 10:46.820
Well, you better.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.604
Because the longer this goes on,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.388
the more obvious it is that you
don't know what you're doing.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.999
AJ:
Careful, Willy.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.914
Mess with Queen Bey,
you'll get a face full of Kelly.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.132
And Michelle.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.830
That's the third one, right?

10:56.873 --> 10:59.223
Okay, Sarah, we all know that
you can make pretty speeches,

10:59.267 --> 11:01.051
but pretty speeches
don't power our homes.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.792
So either you figure out a way

11:02.836 --> 11:06.274
to lead this town or this town
will find someone who can.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.367
DANNY:
It's Josh, right?

11:13.455 --> 11:14.848
Y-You mind if I, um,

11:14.891 --> 11:16.110
walk on this?

11:16.153 --> 11:17.938
It's a free country.[chuckles]

11:17.981 --> 11:19.548
Yeah, so far, anyway.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.637
My name's Danny.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.466
I know you.
You're Idiot Face.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.555
My mom's been talking
about you.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.644
And she calls me Idiot Face.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.254
She calls you
a lot of things,

11:30.298 --> 11:32.648
but I'm not allowed
to say most of 'em.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.346
I don't think
she likes you.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.784
Yeah. I don't think
she does, either.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.350
What'd you do?

11:40.351 --> 11:42.745
A lot of things
I shouldn't have.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.225
Did you say
you're sorry?

11:44.268 --> 11:47.228
[chuckles softly]

11:47.271 --> 11:48.533
I'm working on it.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.668
Is, um...
i-is your mom home?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.017
She's at school.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.018
My dad's here.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.019
That's okay.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.282
Um...

11:58.326 --> 11:59.457
I got to go anyway.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.068
Can you...

12:01.111 --> 12:03.157
can you tell your mom
that I stopped by?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.375
I'll tell her.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.421
Thanks, Josh.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.944
See ya later,

12:07.988 --> 12:10.251
Idiot Face.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.865
Bye, Josh.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.828
WILLIAM:
Phone down. [sighs]

12:21.871 --> 12:26.136
We need to talk about you
sneaking out last night.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.747
Alice Hurley saw you
at Sweetie Pie...

12:27.790 --> 12:29.574
I don't understand
why this is such a big deal.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.794
How many
people can say

12:31.838 --> 12:33.100
they were part
of a brand-new country?

12:33.143 --> 12:34.754
It's exciting.
It's...

12:34.797 --> 12:36.625
historic.It's dangerous.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.629
Look, Bell,
I am not trying to be difficult,

12:40.672 --> 12:42.979
but your stepmom
and I are concerned.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.416
And I'm your father.
It's my job to protect you.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.678
From an ice cream party?

12:46.722 --> 12:47.767
No, from ruining your future.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.594
[chuckles]You're applying

12:49.638 --> 12:51.509
to college next year.
You need to be here studying,

12:51.553 --> 12:54.904
not out playing anarchy dress-up
in Sarah's revolution.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.472
Dad, playing anarchy dress-up
with Ms. Cooper

12:57.515 --> 12:58.821
would help me get into colleges.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.649
No, not the colleges
that we want.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.782
Not the colleges that you want.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.480
Okay, look,

13:05.523 --> 13:07.090
Bella,

13:07.134 --> 13:09.919
I am just trying to make sure
that you are spending time

13:09.963 --> 13:13.270
with people who can help you
be successful.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.532
Sarah's
a good person.

13:14.576 --> 13:18.449
She can give you
a brand-new country.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.366
I'm trying to give you
the whole world.

13:28.546 --> 13:29.983
[sighs]

13:31.985 --> 13:33.334
I look like a realtor.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.944
I think you look
very professional.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.251
Yeah, like
a professional realtor.[chuckles softly]

13:37.294 --> 13:39.514
Ugh.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.255
[grunts softly]

13:41.298 --> 13:42.691
So, uh,

13:42.734 --> 13:44.345
Mom, what are you
gonna do now?

13:44.388 --> 13:47.261
Like, with my trial,
you had something to focus on.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.393
Now that it's over,
I just want to...

13:49.437 --> 13:51.395
want to make sure
you land on your feet.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.267
As opposed to my face.
Right?

13:54.442 --> 13:57.880
I'm sure I'll find something
to keep me very busy.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.448
Um, what if
that something were me?

14:00.491 --> 14:01.623
I'm trying to run a country.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.842
I need help.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.408
You have help.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.410
You have Corinne.
You have AJ.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.108
[chuckles]:
You have Grover.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.761
They don't have your experience.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.851
Well, they also
don't have my drinking problem.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.505
Helping out
with Greylock

14:14.549 --> 14:16.943
means going back
into politics.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.859
We both know
what that world did to me,

14:19.902 --> 14:21.469
what it turned me into.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.688
I can't go
back there.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.909
I think
I'm gonna live my life...

14:27.997 --> 14:31.174
...a little more quietly
from now on.

14:31.218 --> 14:34.134
Well, uh,
we're totally boned.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.831
I just got off the phone with
the guy from Harding Electric.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.486
Greg or... Craig, maybe?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.227
I don't know. Anyway, it doesn't
matter, because he's not coming.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.968
He cancelled his
meeting with you today.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.100
What? Why?

14:44.144 --> 14:46.755
Uh, he said he couldn't
risk losing his contracts

14:46.798 --> 14:49.236
with New Hampshire over
a relationship with us.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.281
And when I asked him
what the hell that means,

14:51.325 --> 14:53.066
he hung up on me. So I called
the other guys on your list.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.502
They all said the same thing.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.286
Wait, so is anyone
gonna meet with me?

14:56.330 --> 14:57.940
Mm-mmm.It's the governor.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.072
It's Gail.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.943
She's trying to sabotage
the town.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.423
CORINNE:
Well, it's working.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.207
I mean, there isn't
an electric company

15:04.251 --> 15:05.905
within a thousand miles of us
willing to sell us power.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.910
We are indeed totally boned.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.048
♪

15:31.060 --> 15:33.280
Queen of the North.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.021
What can I do for you?

15:36.022 --> 15:38.546
You can stop telling
power companies

15:38.589 --> 15:41.027
not to do business
with Greylock.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.377
I haven't told anybody
not to do business with you.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.813
I've simply said
that those who do

15:44.856 --> 15:47.729
can kiss their New Hampshire
contracts goodbye.

15:47.772 --> 15:50.123
It's a little trick
I learned from your mother.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.908
Nobody could bring her rivals
to heel quite like Ellen Cooper.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.171
What you're doing is wrong.

15:55.215 --> 15:58.174
What I'm doing is in the best
interests of my constituents.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.133
Two months ago,
you tried to bulldoze a town

16:00.176 --> 16:01.656
full of your
constituents.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.266
So that I could help
the rest of the state.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.007
Okay.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.661
Do you have any idea
what I could have done

16:06.704 --> 16:08.837
with that coltan money?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.578
I could have
put food on the table

16:10.621 --> 16:13.015
of every hungry child
in New Hampshire.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.626
I could have built a house
for every needy family.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.193
Oh, so now
you're building houses?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.021
And here
I thought

16:19.065 --> 16:21.110
you were so much more interested
in flattening them.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.939
Let me tell you a little secret.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.549
Hmm?

16:25.593 --> 16:27.073
Leadership--

16:27.116 --> 16:29.162
real leadership--

16:29.205 --> 16:30.946
it's just math.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.513
Call it human calculus.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.472
You take a problem and you try
to balance the equation

16:35.516 --> 16:37.605
so that more people
are helped than harmed.

16:37.648 --> 16:38.823
That's it.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.390
That's the whole deal.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.305
And you better get used
to that idea

16:42.349 --> 16:44.699
if you really plan on becoming
a head of state.[phone buzzing]

16:44.742 --> 16:46.744
You also better learn
to play hardball,

16:46.788 --> 16:48.833
or you're the one
who's gonna be flattened.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.060
D'accord.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.235
Oui.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.063
Merci beaucoup.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.891
Hey, Maya.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.937
Uh, why isn't your name on
the list for the sophomore trip?

17:05.981 --> 17:07.548
'Cause I can think of
a million better ways

17:07.591 --> 17:09.289
to spend a weekend than...

17:09.332 --> 17:12.466
uh, eating French fry mush
and staring at windmills.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.990
Poutine's
Canada's national dish.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.470
And the wind farm's
gonna be fun.

17:16.513 --> 17:17.993
I thought it would be cool
to see one,

17:18.037 --> 17:19.342
'cause we studied 'em last term.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.822
Yeah. Sounds
like a real rager.

17:20.865 --> 17:23.825
Why don't you like me?

17:23.868 --> 17:24.956
What?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.089
You always ignore me at school.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
You roll
your eyes at me.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.659
And you're always leaving the
room when I come to see Tyler.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.095
I like you just fine.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.923
Listen, I've never
been bitchy to you,

17:34.966 --> 17:37.099
and I've never talked
about you behind your back.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.319
But... you hate me.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.495
I-I don't get it.
I didn't do anything.

17:41.538 --> 17:42.757
That's right.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.454
You didn't do anything.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.587
When your little flock of
"Daddy dearest" VSCO girls

17:46.630 --> 17:47.718
made fun of
my clothes,

17:47.762 --> 17:49.198
you didn't do
anything.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.634
When your douchebag
ex-boyfriend joked

17:50.678 --> 17:52.810
about how I couldn't
speak English,

17:52.854 --> 17:54.334
you didn't do anything.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.987
I'd never say those things.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.338
No, you let other people
say them for you.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.081
Have fun on your field trip.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.048
H-Hey, hold this,
would you?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.397
Yeah.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.790
GROVER:
Just catching up
on some repairs

18:15.833 --> 18:17.096

18:17.139 --> 18:18.445
Now I know who to call

18:18.488 --> 18:20.099
next time I need help
with a screw.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.274
That came out wrong.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.362
Oh, it sounded right to me.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.363
I meant, like,

18:23.406 --> 18:24.668
handyman stuff.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.105
Yeah, Sarah's great
with a handyman.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.238
Hey, Bella.
You ready for Montreal?

18:29.282 --> 18:30.892
I know
everyone's very excited.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.502
Well, not everyone,
apparently.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.069
What's this?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.115
It's a wind farm,
okay?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.942
And, look,
I know that sounds lame,

18:37.986 --> 18:39.944
but the trip has to include
some activities

18:39.988 --> 18:41.859
that relate to stuff
we've learned in class.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.558
We can't just watch hockey
and eat French fries.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.560
Anyway, I think
the wind farm's cool,

18:46.603 --> 18:47.952
and I really don't care
if that makes me a dork.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.389
That doesn't
make you a dork, Bella.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.000
That makes you a hero.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.700
It's a wind farm just over
the Canadian border.

18:56.744 --> 18:59.181
And based on the research I
did this afternoon, I think

18:59.225 --> 19:00.661
this is the answer
to our power problem.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.837
This place makes
enough electricity for Greylock?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.317
Yeah, and then some.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.014
It's owned by a guy
named Liam Lefèvre.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.668
He's a sovereignist.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.105
He thinks Quebec should be
an independent nation.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.586
Lucky for us,
Governor Taggert doesn't agree.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.109
She opposes sovereignty
for Quebec.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
Which makes her
an enemy for Liam.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.634
And hopefully makes us a friend.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.897
We'll see later,
when I talk to him.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.291
Assuming I can
talk to him at all.

19:22.335 --> 19:23.988
What does that mean?

19:24.032 --> 19:26.121
One of the central tenets
of Quebec's sovereignty movement

19:26.165 --> 19:29.864
is preserving the province's
unique Francophone culture.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.736
So, um, Liam only speaks French.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.129
Okay.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.870
So, who do we know
who speaks French?

19:35.913 --> 19:37.001
BELLA:
Un...

19:37.045 --> 19:39.526
anémomètre girouette.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.703
One... animated giraffe?

19:42.746 --> 19:44.139
[chuckles]

19:44.183 --> 19:48.143
One weathervane anemometer.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.625
It measures wind speed
and direction.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.193
Are you sure about this?

19:54.236 --> 19:58.022
I mean, your dad said he didn't
want you around Ms. Cooper.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.676
And I'm sure she could
find somebody else

19:59.720 --> 20:01.591
to translate for her.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.117
You don't have
to do anything.

20:06.161 --> 20:10.339
I'm kind of sick of being the
girl who doesn't do anything.

20:12.254 --> 20:15.214
I don't really care
about what my dad says.

20:16.780 --> 20:21.089
People need help, and...
I'm gonna give it to 'em.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.665
SARAH:
I absolutely agree, Mr. Lefèvre.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.102
[translating in French]When fancy politicians
try to tell

20:34.145 --> 20:36.409
average people how to live,
you have to fight back.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.846
That's exactly what
we're trying to do here.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.151
But we need your help.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.416
[speaking French]

20:47.768 --> 20:49.291
BELLA:
Wattage no problem.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.597
Easy to hook into your system.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.381
Lights back on
before you know it.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.344
Are you serious?

20:58.387 --> 21:00.998
[speaking French]

21:01.042 --> 21:02.391
Price is price.

21:02.435 --> 21:05.829
Mr. Lefevre, please.
We need power to survive,

21:05.873 --> 21:08.005
and you're the only person
who has it.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.181
Come on.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.227
I thought
we were kindred spirits.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.315
[chuckles]Brothers in arms

21:13.359 --> 21:14.969
against tyranny.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.145
[speaking French]

21:20.670 --> 21:24.979
We are. That's why price is not
six times what we pay now.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.200
How the hell
am I gonna pay for this?

21:29.244 --> 21:31.420
You could raise the taxes?

21:31.464 --> 21:35.381
Um, or maybe you could
sell some town land.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.208
Or maybe the governor
could loan you the money

21:37.252 --> 21:38.949
as, like, a gesture of peace.

21:38.993 --> 21:42.779
You're not gonna
squeeze a cent out of her.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.433
I'd have better luck

21:44.477 --> 21:46.043
taking a metal detector out into
the park and trying to dig up...

21:48.872 --> 21:50.744
That's it.

21:50.787 --> 21:51.745
What?

21:51.788 --> 21:53.312
That's how we pay for it.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.878
We have to dig.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.793
With him.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.100
With who?

21:59.143 --> 22:01.711
[knocking]

22:01.755 --> 22:04.758
Guess my "goodbye" was
a little premature, huh?

22:14.550 --> 22:17.031
I'm sorry. You want Lydon
to dig for coltan in Greylock?

22:17.074 --> 22:18.206
Didn't you just
declare independence

22:18.249 --> 22:19.599
to stop that from happening?

22:19.642 --> 22:20.600
I changed my mind.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.731
About your country?

22:21.775 --> 22:23.211
About your company.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.604
Oh, so you're ready
to admit that maybe

22:24.647 --> 22:26.170
we aren't the, uh,
soulless corporate worms

22:26.214 --> 22:27.737
you thought we were?

22:27.781 --> 22:30.261
I don't thinkyou're soulless
corporate worms.

22:30.305 --> 22:32.438
I know you are.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.440
And that's exactly
why you're here.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.746
I need cash to pay Greylock's
electric bill,

22:36.790 --> 22:39.445
but all the money this town has
is buried underneath it.

22:39.488 --> 22:42.752
Who better to go digging in
the dirt than a bunch of worms?

22:45.755 --> 22:48.410
Lydon can dig two mines--

22:48.454 --> 22:51.544
here and here.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.720
That's it.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.722
No processing facilities,

22:55.765 --> 22:58.768
no freight depots,
no whatever else.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.291
And you have to pay
for our power

23:00.335 --> 23:02.206
until the mines are operational.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.905
Once money starts coming in,
the town will pay Lydon back.

23:05.862 --> 23:06.950
No.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.256
No, you won't pay
for our power?

23:08.299 --> 23:10.214
No, we won't dig
for coltan in this town.

23:10.258 --> 23:12.782
The company's time is
better spent elsewhere.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.741
Sorry, sis.
Lydon's been busy

23:14.784 --> 23:17.091
since our little battle
started two months ago.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.702
Truth is,
we don't need Greylock anymore.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.095
Yes, you do.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.488
Because our little battle
wasn't so little.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.054
You said so yourself.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.143
The media's all over you,
your stock has plummeted.

23:26.187 --> 23:28.581
Lydon's in need of a makeover.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.757
What better way
to show the world

23:30.800 --> 23:34.587
you know how to do business
in a reasonable and ethical way

23:34.630 --> 23:37.503
than to come back to Greylock

23:37.546 --> 23:41.855
and to do business
in a reasonable and ethical way?

23:47.861 --> 23:49.471
I'm not suggesting

23:49.515 --> 23:52.735
we bulldoze the town.
I only offered Danny two mines.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.564
Just enough to get our lights
on and keep us afloat.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.000
But why Lydon?

23:57.044 --> 23:58.480
Can't you find anybody else?

23:58.524 --> 24:00.351
There's only a handful

24:00.395 --> 24:03.050
of companies in the world that
know how to mine for coltan,

24:03.093 --> 24:04.965
and every single one of them is

24:05.008 --> 24:06.096
a cold-blooded,

24:06.140 --> 24:07.358
Bond-villain greed monster.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.143
But when it comes down to it,

24:09.186 --> 24:10.710
I would rather stick

24:10.753 --> 24:12.668
with the devil we know
than the devil we don't.

24:12.712 --> 24:15.366
"Devil" is one word for Danny.
I can think of plenty of others.

24:19.675 --> 24:23.636
I know that having my brother
around will be tough.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.638
But if I have to negotiate
for Greylock's future,

24:25.681 --> 24:27.640
I'd rather the person
across from me be someone

24:27.683 --> 24:30.512
who I know isn't gonna
lie to me, who's proven

24:30.556 --> 24:32.645
he's not gonna break the rules
to get what he wants.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.212
I'm sorry.
When did Danny prove that?It was Danny.

24:35.256 --> 24:39.347
He was the one who stopped
Lydon's blackmail plot.

24:39.390 --> 24:43.438
Your mom going on TV
stopped Lydon's blackmail plot.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.092
Yeah, she went on TV
because Danny told her

24:45.135 --> 24:47.442
what his boss was
trying to do to me.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.226
Why would he torpedo
his own company?

24:49.270 --> 24:51.838
I don't know.
He said what Marilyn was doing

24:51.881 --> 24:54.144
didn't sit right,
and I'm his little sister,

24:54.188 --> 24:56.407
and he didn't want to let
anyone mess with me like that.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.978
I didn't want to tell you guys
because I didn't want

25:02.022 --> 25:03.632
to give you any reason
to think of Danny

25:03.676 --> 25:05.504
as anything other than
a selfish, arrogant dick,

25:05.547 --> 25:08.289
and he is a selfish,
arrogant dick...

25:08.332 --> 25:10.117
but at least I know he's not

25:10.160 --> 25:12.032
a cheat.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.774
You guys have to

25:14.817 --> 25:16.602
trust me.
Bringing Danny

25:16.645 --> 25:19.822
back to Greylock
is the only option we have

25:19.866 --> 25:21.650
to make this country work.

25:27.308 --> 25:30.224
Hey. Aren't you supposed
to be in Montreal?

25:30.267 --> 25:34.054
Didn't feel right leaving
Bella behind after what she did.

25:34.097 --> 25:36.012
Oh, what did she do?She helped

25:36.056 --> 25:37.797
translate this meeting
with some French guy

25:37.840 --> 25:40.713
to help Ms. Cooper
get the power back on.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.541
And her dad was pissed.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.152
Told her she couldn't
go to Montreal, so...

25:45.195 --> 25:47.589
Wait. He makes her
take French lessons,

25:47.633 --> 25:49.199
then grounds her for using them?

25:51.419 --> 25:54.335
So... why did she help?Said she didn't

25:54.378 --> 25:57.077
want to be the girl
who doesn't do anything anymore.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.516
That supposed to be a horse?

26:01.560 --> 26:04.780
Yeah. There something
wrong with my horse?

26:06.086 --> 26:07.609
Let me help you.

26:09.176 --> 26:12.483
Here.
I think you mixed it up.

26:13.484 --> 26:16.313
DANNY:
We have a deal.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.402
On one condition.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.882
You offered us
two coltan mines?

26:19.926 --> 26:23.407
For my bosses to say yes
to your plan,

26:23.451 --> 26:27.324
you'd need to let us
build a third mine... here.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.152
You're joking.

26:29.196 --> 26:31.415
There are two houses
on that land, Danny.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.635
Lydon would cover any relocation
costs for the residents,

26:33.679 --> 26:35.376
plus a five percent...Absolutely not.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.204
Sarah.One of those
houses belongs...

26:37.247 --> 26:39.423
I know who it belongs to.

26:39.467 --> 26:40.860
It's not my call.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.818
That third mine
would be more lucrative

26:42.862 --> 26:44.385
than the first two combined.

26:44.428 --> 26:47.257
If you allow us
to drill this site,

26:47.301 --> 26:49.346
I'm authorized
to sign your paperwork.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.348
We'd issue a payment
to your wind farmer today.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.699
The lights would be back on
in Greylock by tonight.

26:53.742 --> 26:55.918
No.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.051
I can't ask anyone
to give up their home.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.575
Agree to this deal,
and Greylock gets more

27:00.619 --> 27:02.185
than just its lights back on.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.709
It gets a permanent source
of income

27:03.752 --> 27:06.363
to pay for all the things
a country needs.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.192
It's just two houses,

27:09.236 --> 27:11.281
and right here, right now,

27:11.325 --> 27:14.328
you finally get what you've been
fighting so hard for.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.025
And what's that?

27:16.069 --> 27:17.766
Freedom.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.956
I know it hurts, but

27:34.000 --> 27:36.785
without you,
without what you did,

27:36.829 --> 27:39.309
Greylock doesn't exist.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.398
The whole town is
wiped off the map.

27:42.530 --> 27:45.446
If you decide
to give Danny what he wants,

27:45.489 --> 27:49.058
don't focus on the two homes
that you're losing. Focus on

27:49.102 --> 27:51.495
the hundreds that
you've already saved.

27:52.496 --> 27:55.978
Grover...
Grover built that house himself.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.459
I know.

27:58.502 --> 28:01.375
It was his wedding gift
to Patience.

28:01.418 --> 28:04.030
I know.

28:04.073 --> 28:08.512
[sighs]
What am I supposed to tell him?

28:08.556 --> 28:10.297
The truth.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.125
Okay?

28:12.168 --> 28:14.736
You tell him
the truth.

28:26.574 --> 28:29.272
How's it going,
Madam President?

28:29.316 --> 28:31.144
No sign

28:31.187 --> 28:35.452
of the Hungarian Army yet, but
I'm sure they're on their way.

28:35.496 --> 28:36.845
Nah, you're killing
the whole leadership thing,

28:36.889 --> 28:39.761
like I knew you would.
So...

28:39.805 --> 28:43.286
I got your text. What'd
you want talk to me about?

28:43.330 --> 28:44.853
I saw Danny earlier.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.855
With any luck,
we should have the...

28:46.899 --> 28:49.118
the power back
in the next day or so.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.817
That's good news.Yeah.

28:51.860 --> 28:55.211
Thing is, there's...
there's bad news, too.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.605
One of the mines is gonna go on

28:57.648 --> 28:59.563
the northeast
edge of town.

28:59.607 --> 29:02.088
Near my house.
