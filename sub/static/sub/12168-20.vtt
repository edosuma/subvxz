00:01.251 --> 00:03.420
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:03.462 --> 00:04.588
Hello, Michael.

00:04.630 --> 00:05.422
Do you remember me?

00:05.464 --> 00:06.882
I don't even know who I am.

00:06.924 --> 00:10.219
I get the feeling like they
know something, something they're not telling me.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.261
He's not...

00:11.303 --> 00:12.513
human!

00:14.181 --> 00:15.849
I'm a Wraith!

00:16.683 --> 00:18.560
I'm returning to what I was.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.229
There are Wraith nearby.

00:20.646 --> 00:24.608
Not only has our dear lieutenant's rejoined the Wraith,
but he's taken with him the knowledge
that Atlantis still exists.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.693
They will send another wave of hive ships.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.779
<i>We found a sister ship to the Aurora</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:29.613
<i>called the...</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:30.447
Orion.

00:30.489 --> 00:34.409
All chairs and seatbacks into
your upright and locked positions.

00:34.451 --> 00:38.789
Be advised,
we have detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.254
All of my people have been
safely relocated to the City.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.505
Did everything go smoothly?

00:46.547 --> 00:50.676
Yeah, they're pretty used to it, back and forth,
by now. Have you picked up any of their contacts?

00:50.717 --> 00:51.718
Sergeant?

00:51.760 --> 00:52.678
Negative, Ma'am.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.472
Scans are still clear.
It looks like it's just the one hive ship.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.473
And our cloak?

00:56.515 --> 00:58.809
Up and running. All readings are in the green.

00:58.851 --> 00:59.852
Good.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.354
Colonel Caldwell, are you in position?

01:02.771 --> 01:06.108
<i>Affirmative. We're out of scanning range and</i>
<i>ready to jump into position on your go-ahead.</i>

01:06.149 --> 01:07.359
<i>Excellent.</i>

01:07.401 --> 01:13.198
Just for the record, I still think that we should be
in orbit around Atlantis, ready to open up on
that hive ship the second it comes out of hyperspace.

01:13.240 --> 01:19.997
It's one hive, Colonel, which suggests they
might just be checking up on us. There's no
need to confirm our presence if we don't have to.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.331
<i>Just stand by.</i>

01:21.373 --> 01:22.791
Standing by.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.711
Colonel Sheppard, how goes it on your end?

01:26.128 --> 01:30.507
<i>Well, we're out of sensor range</i>
<i>and all that, but whether or not we're</i>
<i>ready to fight is a whole another story.</i>

01:30.549 --> 01:33.427
<i>Getting this ship up and running</i>
<i>in under a month is a miracle.</i>

01:33.468 --> 01:35.929
<i>Do we start the beatification now or later?</i>

01:36.346 --> 01:39.892
Rodney, if the hive opens up on us,
I want Orion's drones.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.603
Which means we're gonna need
the hyperdrive to get in position.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.522
Which means we'll need shields,
which means you want everything!

01:45.564 --> 01:48.650
- I like everything! Can we do it or not?
- Well, don't get up!

01:48.692 --> 01:49.693
<i>Shields!</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:52.613
Yes.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.489
Jump into position.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.783
Maybe.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.452
Release the drones.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.997
Probably not.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.499
Well, it's pointless to get
in position if we can't fire.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.542
<i>You know,</i>

02:05.584 --> 02:09.086
let's talk about it for a really long time,
that'll help for sure.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.633
<i>Rodney's doing everything inhumanly</i>
<i>possible to be ready.</i>

02:12.674 --> 02:13.884
I have a contact.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.311
<i>Atlantis, report?</i>

02:25.354 --> 02:27.231
<i>It's going into geosynchronous orbit.</i>

02:28.065 --> 02:29.733
Hasn't armed any of its weapons.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.738
If they do, I want you to switch from cloak to shield
as quickly as possible. Don't wait for my order.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.614
Yes, Ma'am.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.909
You could be a little more chatty, Elizabeth.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.411
I'm sorry, I was just waiting
for them to make the next move.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.705
Transmitting a signal, audio only.

02:44.748 --> 02:45.999
Put it on speaker.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.293
<i>We know you are there.</i>

02:48.335 --> 02:49.962
<i>We mean you no harm.</i>

02:50.003 --> 02:51.213
<i>Please respond.</i>

02:53.090 --> 02:54.758
John, are you hearing this?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.261
It's repeating again.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.137
<i>We mean you no harm.</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:03.100
<i>There is no point in hiding, Doctor Weir.</i>

03:03.141 --> 03:04.560
<i>We know you are there.</i>

03:04.601 --> 03:06.019
<i>We mean you no harm.</i>

03:06.061 --> 03:07.688
<i>Please respond.</i>

03:08.313 --> 03:10.190
Is that who I think it is?

03:10.232 --> 03:11.859
<i>He's addressing me by name.</i>

03:12.276 --> 03:14.987
I think we can assume it's Michael.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.848
- You don't actually intend to respond?
<i>- Why not?</i>

04:24.932 --> 04:26.308
Where do you want me to start?

04:26.350 --> 04:29.019
I think we can safely say our cover is blown.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.896
I wouldn't jump to that conclusion.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.190
The message is from Michael, Colonel.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.691
They know we're here.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.069
<i>- But they don't know exactly where we are.</i>
<i>{Y:i}- He's right.</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:40.280
Answer them, and we guarantee
the first shot won't miss.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.991
Teyla?

04:44.660 --> 04:50.707
Any attempt on my part to connect
with Michael will confirm our location
as surely as if you answer by radio.

04:51.542 --> 04:55.504
I recommend you open a secure channel
to the hive via the Daedalus.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.589
That way they won't be able
to pinpoint Atlantis' position.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.675
We can always turn the shield on.

04:59.716 --> 05:04.471
And I believe we have enough combined
firepower to take out a single hive if we need to.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.808
Have you ever heard of a Wraith behaving this way?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.268
No.

05:09.685 --> 05:10.936
Nor have I.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.771
Right.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.107
Let's hear what they have to say.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.908
Rodney and I have set up the subspace relay to

05:24.950 --> 05:30.706
go through the Daedalus, and I've been able
to configure our systems to handle both
their audio and video frequencies. So,

05:30.747 --> 05:33.458
we should be able to see and hear them live.

05:33.876 --> 05:36.170
They want to know what's taking so long.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.340
Open the channel.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.185
Hello, Michael.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.061
Why the long delay?

05:54.104 --> 05:57.232
We needed to take a few precautions
before contacting you.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.109
<i>I'm sure you understand why.</i>

05:59.735 --> 06:01.612
I said we would not harm you.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.531
Well, excuse me for not taking you at your word.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.825
You wanted to talk, we're listening.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.868
Go ahead.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.162
Over two years ago,

06:11.205 --> 06:13.498
every hive ship in this galaxy

06:13.540 --> 06:16.627
emerged from hibernation prematurely.

06:17.085 --> 06:21.215
We thought a new,
<i>rich feeding ground had been discovered.</i>

06:21.256 --> 06:22.257
Earth.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.134
Unfortunately,

06:24.176 --> 06:25.802
locating your planet

06:25.844 --> 06:30.182
and uncovering an effective means
of transportation to get there

06:30.224 --> 06:33.310
has proven... quite difficult.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.647
Well, I can't say I'm sad to hear that.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.691
<i>For the first time since the dawn of our race,</i>

06:39.733 --> 06:43.320
there are too few of your kind
to feed the waking Wraith.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.657
This has resulted in civil war.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.202
<i>Hives are forming alliances</i>

06:50.244 --> 06:52.496
and the strong are attacking the weak.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.790
Which are you?

06:54.831 --> 06:58.335
Our goals are not dissimilar, Dr. Weir.

06:58.377 --> 07:01.129
<i>You would like to eliminate the Wraith as a threat?</i>

07:01.171 --> 07:03.131
I find that hard to believe.

07:03.549 --> 07:07.511
We would like you to give us Dr. Beckett's retrovirus.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.596
If we were able to distribute it

07:09.638 --> 07:13.141
among the rival Wraith hives in sufficient quantity,

07:13.183 --> 07:15.644
this would both render them helpless

07:15.686 --> 07:17.312
and provide us

07:17.354 --> 07:19.606
with an alternative food source.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.109
Those Wraith would become humans.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.820
On the surface, perhaps.

07:24.862 --> 07:28.365
As a sign of good faith,
I am sending you our jamming codes.

07:28.407 --> 07:32.536
This program was established and
distribute before the civil war broke out,

07:32.578 --> 07:35.873
so we assume all the hive ships are still using it.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.375
By figuring out how to bypass

07:38.417 --> 07:40.669
or disable this program,

07:41.086 --> 07:45.257
you would be able to beam your nuclear
weapons aboard any of our ships

07:45.299 --> 07:47.134
<i>whenever you so please.</i>

07:48.177 --> 07:50.470
<i>We are willing to help you achieve this</i>

07:50.512 --> 07:51.930
if you help us.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.433
They're sending a data burst.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.769
Download it to a non-networked, firewalled computer.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.604
Yes, Ma'am.

07:58.812 --> 08:04.443
<i>I'm sure you'll want to recall all the ships you had</i>
<i>lying in wait for us and discuss this with your people.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:06.320
We will await your reply.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.405
But

08:08.614 --> 08:11.533
should you make an attempt to destroy us,

08:12.159 --> 08:18.832
we will alert every Wraith in this galaxy
<i>to the fact that Atlantis is still very much intact.</i>

08:19.666 --> 08:21.752
I'm sure you wouldn't want that.

08:27.382 --> 08:33.222
Well, I think it's safe to say that if they were going
to attack us, they would have done it by now.
They let the Daedalus land without incident.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.097
And you're sure they don't know about the Orion?

08:35.140 --> 08:37.808
I ordered Lorne to park her
just outside of sensor range.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.644
<i>This...</i>

08:39.102 --> 08:40.729
this is incredible!

08:40.770 --> 08:43.232
<i>I can't believe they actually sent this over so freely.</i>

08:43.273 --> 08:46.568
If I can figure out how to break through this program,
which is, well, as you know, pretty likely,

08:46.610 --> 08:49.696
we could nuke any hive ship that we came across.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.616
- Including Michael's?
- Well, it might take a couple of tries the first time.

08:52.658 --> 08:55.536
Long enough to tell the rest
of the Wraith we're still around.

08:55.744 --> 08:58.455
<i>If they really are willing to let</i>
<i>me run tests on their ship...</i>

08:58.497 --> 08:59.581
I mean, this is...

08:59.623 --> 09:02.000
an amazing opportunity, Elizabeth.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.877
An amazing opportunity?

09:03.919 --> 09:05.754
<i>Well, think about it.</i>

09:05.796 --> 09:08.048
This is essentially our idea.

09:08.090 --> 09:12.469
We created the retrovirus in order to do
exactly what they're proposing we do.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.887
What's the downside?

09:13.929 --> 09:17.015
<i>I mean, other than that fact that</i>
<i>we'd be working with the Wraith.</i>

09:17.057 --> 09:18.267
Isn't that enough?

09:18.308 --> 09:21.812
It would mean at least something good
came of our experiment with Michael.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.689
<i>I am not sure we have a choice.</i>

09:24.314 --> 09:27.025
It appears they have kept our existence a secret,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.111
but if we do not help...

09:29.736 --> 09:30.988
There is that.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.784
Carson, I know you've been working
on the weaponization of the retrovirus.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.244
<i>How close are you?</i>

09:37.286 --> 09:38.495
We're close.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.372
<i>It still needs work,</i>

09:40.581 --> 09:42.040
but we're close.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.548
What?

09:50.591 --> 09:51.842
What do you think?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.136
Let's do it.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.596
<i>Really?</i>

09:55.637 --> 09:57.055
<i>Sheppard said it himself...</i>

09:57.097 --> 09:58.515
it's our idea.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.975
I just thought you of all people...

10:00.017 --> 10:04.146
Hey, if they want our help killing other Wraith,
that's one kind of help I'm happy to provide.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.397
Okay.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.942
So, we're going to do this.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.781
I'll accept the offer.

10:19.077 --> 10:19.995
Teyla.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.872
Colonel?

10:22.497 --> 10:25.626
Something tells me you don't
think this is such a good idea.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.754
As I said, I do not believe we have a choice.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.006
But a good idea is still a good idea.

10:31.048 --> 10:36.261
I voiced my concern about this plan to change the
Wraith into humans prior to the experiment on Michael.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.513
And we convinced you.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.806
No, Colonel.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.518
I chose to place my trust in you.

10:42.935 --> 10:43.977
There's a difference.

10:44.019 --> 10:47.314
Look, it's not like we're setting out
to create a bunch of Michaels here.

10:47.356 --> 10:50.025
No, we are creating a food source for other Wraith.

10:50.067 --> 10:53.987
Instead of us, which is the part
I am fine with, by the way.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.784
I guess I just want you to be fine with it, too.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.120
If this is the full extent of their plan...

11:04.414 --> 11:05.666
What do you mean?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.628
They are Wraith.

11:21.932 --> 11:27.145
<i>This is Escort 2. We have a visual on the Wraith</i>
<i>scout ship and are entering formation with Escort 5.</i>

11:32.568 --> 11:37.573
I got to tell you, when I woke up this morning,
I honestly didn't think this would be happening.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.743
God, I hope we're doing the right thing.

12:07.811 --> 12:08.854
Touchdown.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.060
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.937
Welcome to Atlantis.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.042
My people are willing to work
with some of your scientists,

13:12.084 --> 13:16.630
but no more than three Wraith will be
allowed on this base at any given time.

13:16.672 --> 13:21.468
You will be subjected to extensive searches
that we we'll perform at random intervals.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.555
If any harmful materials or
weapons are found on your,

13:25.180 --> 13:26.849
your fellow Wraith,

13:27.182 --> 13:30.811
we'll consider it an act of aggression
and immediately destroy your ship.

13:30.853 --> 13:36.441
- We are also monitoring all of your transmissions.
- All we want is the retrovirus.

13:36.483 --> 13:40.404
It is the key to ending a civil war
that could go on for centuries.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.740
Impose whatever conditions you wish.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.120
Let us begin.

13:51.665 --> 13:56.461
Aside from a slight
refinement since we last used it on,

13:57.087 --> 13:58.130
well, on

13:58.172 --> 14:00.841
the one we called Michael.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.343
Do you have names?

14:03.385 --> 14:04.803
What shall I call you?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.680
What shall I call him?

14:08.765 --> 14:11.685
Well, I suppose in the end it
really doesn't matter, does it?

14:13.979 --> 14:15.439
<i>Okay...</i>

14:16.064 --> 14:16.982
Where was I?

14:17.024 --> 14:20.027
- We were just getting to dissemination.
- Yes, yes. Thank you.

14:20.068 --> 14:20.944
Now,

14:21.153 --> 14:25.532
when disseminating an aerosolized medicine
such as the retrovirus, one needs to take in

14:25.574 --> 14:27.618
<i>a number of different considerations...</i>

14:27.659 --> 14:29.369
proximity to patient,

14:29.411 --> 14:30.746
particle size,

14:30.787 --> 14:32.289
<i>ventilation pattern,</i>

14:32.331 --> 14:35.542
<i>- airway architecture, dosage...</i>
- You have turned it into a gas?

14:35.751 --> 14:36.710
Yes.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.587
An aerosol gas.

14:41.298 --> 14:45.260
On Earth, we would normally use a technique
called aerodynamic dissemination,

14:45.469 --> 14:49.431
but because of the problems of doing
that inside, say, like, a Wraith hive ship,

14:49.473 --> 14:52.559
<i>we have attempted various styles</i>
<i>of thermal dissemination.</i>

14:52.601 --> 14:54.728
- Explosives?
- Explosives. Yes, yes.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.356
The problem with an explosive delivery system is that,

14:57.397 --> 14:59.233
because the drug is now an aerosol,

14:59.274 --> 15:01.735
a third of the tests ignited the medication,

15:01.777 --> 15:03.195
rendering it useless.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.655
They call it flashing.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.909
<i>Long ago, we experimented with gas weapons.</i>

15:09.243 --> 15:13.830
We found them most difficult
to use in outer-atmosphere combat.

15:13.872 --> 15:21.129
When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused
explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.841
We had thought of that, yes,

15:24.258 --> 15:26.552
but if you want to affect a

15:26.593 --> 15:29.680
large population simultaneously,

15:29.721 --> 15:33.016
<i>an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.</i>

15:33.100 --> 15:36.353
Now we have to figure out a way to get
it into your enemies' hive ship.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.396
Yes.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.856
We will.

15:43.652 --> 15:44.903
It's pretty interesting stuff.

15:44.945 --> 15:50.117
I think I've learned more about Wraith technology
in the last hour than I have in the past two years.

15:52.828 --> 15:53.662
Oh, come on.

15:53.704 --> 15:58.458
I understand you're an Asgard and everything, but
even you've got to feel a bit of an adrenaline buzz.

15:58.500 --> 16:03.046
My body does not possess the adrenal gland
that produces epinephrine in your system,

16:03.088 --> 16:04.631
and even if I did,

16:04.673 --> 16:07.009
I would not be as easily impressed.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.762
I get it, I get it... you think you're smarter
than I am. Are you ready to go or not?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.265
I have been for some time.

16:16.393 --> 16:17.644
This is McKay.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.730
Get me an open channel to the hive.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.148
<i>You're live.</i>

16:21.190 --> 16:22.232
<i>Go ahead.</i>

16:24.318 --> 16:27.446
This is Dr. Rodney McKay
aboard the Earth ship Daedalus.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.157
We would like... with your permission,

16:30.199 --> 16:36.413
to begin attempting to beam an innocuous canister
onto your ship while you are actively jamming.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.541
We're hoping, through trial and error, that we can

16:39.666 --> 16:40.709
slowly

16:40.751 --> 16:42.669
disarm or

16:42.878 --> 16:44.546
break the code.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.215
May we proceed?

16:49.968 --> 16:52.262
<i>You may begin, Dr. McKay.</i>

16:52.304 --> 16:54.348
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.059
That was weird.

16:58.101 --> 16:58.936
Shall we?

17:06.568 --> 17:08.111
Hello, Michael.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.865
It seemed right to come back here.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.785
And to see you.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.287
Thank you for coming.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.998
You didn't have to bring him.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.875
I insisted.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.212
The last time I saw you,

17:25.420 --> 17:27.714
I really was going to feed on you...

17:28.131 --> 17:30.759
but it was not a matter of choice.

17:30.801 --> 17:31.885
It was...

17:32.302 --> 17:33.554
instinct.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.473
That is what you have come here to say?

17:38.350 --> 17:43.564
You have given me a very rare
perspective among the Wraith.

17:43.605 --> 17:48.151
Few of us have ever come to know
the humans we are going to feed on as...

17:48.652 --> 17:51.280
anything more than a means to survive.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.948
<i>And still,</i>

17:53.574 --> 17:55.659
I would do what I had to do.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.371
But what you

17:59.621 --> 18:01.707
- did to me...
- We did the same.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.626
- To survive.
- I thought you were trying to help me.

18:04.668 --> 18:05.878
What's your point?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.880
We're not as different as you think.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.840
We are nothing like you.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.513
You are a lot more like us than
you allow yourselves to believe.

18:16.555 --> 18:19.057
I will not argue with you, Michael. It is pointless.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.476
If we are to make this alliance work,

18:22.686 --> 18:26.273
we must both overcome the instincts that define us.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.321
We will not meet again.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.324
Goodbye.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.368
Goodbye.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.377
You're proving my point right now.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.131
Oh, every fiber in your body wants to kill me.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.345
Instinct is so hard to overcome.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.223
But what would happen to our alliance?

18:59.264 --> 19:04.144
Every Wraith ship in this galaxy would
descend upon this City and destroy it.

19:06.438 --> 19:07.689
Is it worth it, Ronon?

19:07.731 --> 19:09.983
- If it was up to me...
- But it isn't!

19:31.213 --> 19:33.757
What will happen once you disseminate the weapon?

19:33.924 --> 19:36.343
We shall continue on to the next hive.

19:36.385 --> 19:37.386
Then what?

19:37.636 --> 19:41.557
<i>Well, we will continue until we</i>
<i>have conquered all of our enemies.</i>

19:41.598 --> 19:44.476
And you think our retrovirus can do all that?

19:44.518 --> 19:45.686
Yes.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.397
The one we're freely handing over to you.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.023
I see.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.612
Your people will not be harmed.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.074
Such will be the nature of our agreement.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.285
<i>And what about all the other humans</i>

20:01.368 --> 20:02.786
on the other worlds?

20:03.245 --> 20:05.581
Any chance you'll stop feeding on them?

20:05.706 --> 20:09.251
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.587
There will come a time,

20:12.045 --> 20:13.046
however,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.592
when our enemy will be vanquished.

20:16.633 --> 20:20.470
At which point you'll return to killing
ordinary folks the old fashioned way.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.140
That will take far longer than your short lifetime.

20:23.182 --> 20:26.018
Let's just say I'm worried about my grandkids.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.562
<i>The technology of this City...</i>

20:28.645 --> 20:31.565
this City that you now control...

20:31.732 --> 20:34.860
is far more powerful than that of the Wraith.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.697
Yet we brought the Lantians to their knees...

20:39.990 --> 20:42.034
- Why?
- Far greater numbers.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.579
Numbers that will be diminished by your retrovirus.

20:46.121 --> 20:48.498
Balance will be restored.

20:48.999 --> 20:52.586
I believe that is as much as either of us can ask for.

20:53.212 --> 20:54.671
Don't you?

20:58.634 --> 20:59.259
No!

20:59.301 --> 21:02.513
I'm sorry, an aerosol gas is the only way to go.

21:04.056 --> 21:04.973
<i>Not</i>

21:05.015 --> 21:07.226
that I want to anger you, or

21:07.434 --> 21:08.477
not

21:08.519 --> 21:11.146
take any of your ideas into consideration.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.689
It's just that, well,

21:12.731 --> 21:15.567
we've been working on this for some time now.

21:16.777 --> 21:17.819
Very well.

21:18.529 --> 21:21.990
<i>Can't you smuggle a gas bomb</i>
<i>onto one of your rival hives?</i>

21:22.199 --> 21:28.622
Such a device would not allow for the gas
to affect the whole ship in sufficient time.

21:28.664 --> 21:33.418
They would open fire on our own
ship the moment the gas was detected.

21:33.502 --> 21:34.503
Aye.

21:34.545 --> 21:37.589
You need to reach all the occupied compartments

21:37.631 --> 21:39.091
at once.

21:40.384 --> 21:43.846
If we could get the aerosol gas
into the life support system...

21:43.887 --> 21:46.265
How long for the gas to take effect?

21:46.932 --> 21:50.269
- Well, theoretically...
- We don't know.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.645
Well, we don't.

21:51.687 --> 21:53.939
He's right, we don't.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.527
Then I will have to make arrangements.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.684
I want to go in there.

22:32.436 --> 22:33.562
Now.

22:38.859 --> 22:40.611
Vent the gas from the room.

22:55.209 --> 22:58.545
Don't worry. He'll begin to turn
back in only a number of days

22:58.587 --> 23:00.297
if we don't start administering the...

23:01.423 --> 23:02.466
<i>Colonel.</i>

23:03.300 --> 23:05.844
We knew this would be a part of the bargain.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.233
I've seen enough.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.541
It works.

23:42.589 --> 23:46.176
There is another hive ship a
single jump away from this system.

23:46.218 --> 23:49.763
They recently attempted to attack our ship.

23:50.472 --> 23:54.226
I would like to test the virus on them first.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.688
With all due respect, Madam,

23:57.896 --> 23:59.773
<i>I don't think we're there yet.</i>

23:59.940 --> 24:01.650
<i>We've been working with your scientist here on</i>

24:01.692 --> 24:06.697
- an effective means of disseminating
the virus as an aerosol...
- And you have succeeded.

24:06.738 --> 24:09.575
Transforming a single Wraith
in a controlled environment

24:09.616 --> 24:13.078
and trying to infect an entire hive at
once are completely two different things.

24:13.120 --> 24:18.041
We plan on entering their hive under the
pretense of negotiating our surrender.

24:18.083 --> 24:23.255
Part of the delegation will break away, planting
small canisters of gas throughout the ship.

24:23.297 --> 24:27.134
We need only to create a system
that will synchronize the release.

24:27.176 --> 24:28.468
Well, we can do that.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.387
But do we have the kind of volume we need?

24:30.429 --> 24:32.639
Aye. Our lab has been

24:32.681 --> 24:35.559
churning it out since
we struck our deal with our friends here.

24:36.268 --> 24:37.895
Then we can do this?

24:39.062 --> 24:39.897
Well...

24:41.064 --> 24:42.316
It's up to them.

24:43.859 --> 24:46.904
I would like our people to go along and observe.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.572
For what purpose?

24:48.614 --> 24:50.782
Make sure you stick to the plan,

24:50.824 --> 24:52.910
do what you say you're gonna do.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.537
Very well.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.457
Good luck.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.876
To us all.

25:13.388 --> 25:16.934
Jumper 8 has cleared the bay, cloaked,
and is heading for the two hives ships.

25:17.017 --> 25:20.312
- We are running quiet and out of sensor range.
- Thank you, Captain.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.773
I guess now we just wait.

25:22.940 --> 25:25.400
This trial's a little premature, don't you think?

25:25.734 --> 25:28.529
Guess that's what happens when
the Wraith get too excited.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.947
What if they fail?

25:30.447 --> 25:33.784
Maybe they'll blow each other to
kingdom come. We can all go home.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.744
I thought we wanted this to work.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.539
I'm just saying if this thing goes south,

25:38.580 --> 25:41.667
we can't let
the word get out we were involved in this.

25:46.338 --> 25:47.381
Carson.

25:47.965 --> 25:49.049
Elizabeth.

25:49.967 --> 25:52.261
When I developed this retrovirus for the Wraith,

25:52.302 --> 25:56.014
it was to free them from what I
perceived to be an unnatural state.

25:56.306 --> 26:00.435
Now, the very moment they take human form,
they'll face a horribly painful death.

26:00.644 --> 26:02.938
No matter how we rationalize this,

26:03.146 --> 26:04.940
we're still letting the Wraith kill humans.

26:05.148 --> 26:08.652
I guess it depends on how you define "human".

26:08.694 --> 26:11.738
We can't judge an entire race based on the fact that

26:11.780 --> 26:13.448
Michael's experiment didn't work.

26:13.490 --> 26:16.618
If you're asking me whether or
not I'm losing sleep over this...

26:20.706 --> 26:21.582
Well...

26:21.623 --> 26:25.169
I am taking those sedatives you prescribed.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.798
We're getting
telemetry back from the cloaked Jumper, Sir.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.924
It's in theater.

26:30.966 --> 26:32.176
Let's see it.

26:33.677 --> 26:35.762
That's our hive there on the left.

26:36.096 --> 26:37.556
"Our hive".

26:37.764 --> 26:39.141
That's weird.

26:42.978 --> 26:45.606
The delegation is aboard. Now we wait.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.361
They didn't need you on the Daedalus?

26:51.403 --> 26:56.283
Colonel Caldwell believed my time was
better spent disabling their jamming code.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.619
So, they can fly that ship without you?

26:58.660 --> 27:03.457
Yes, but apparently you cannot
run these tests without me.

27:03.498 --> 27:06.168
I'm sure I would have been fine.

27:06.210 --> 27:08.128
I am not as sure.

27:09.171 --> 27:10.088
Really?

27:10.589 --> 27:11.507
Well...

27:15.552 --> 27:16.386
Okay.

27:17.054 --> 27:18.514
Try it now.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.148
Well, well.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.609
Turns out the human knows
what he's doing after all.

27:30.651 --> 27:31.777
<i>Indeed.</i>

27:31.818 --> 27:35.030
Your assistance on this project will be noted.

27:35.072 --> 27:36.865
My assistance?

27:42.621 --> 27:46.250
The delegation transport is returning
to the friendly hive ahead of schedule.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.298
What was that?

27:54.299 --> 27:55.968
The transport has been destroyed.

27:56.301 --> 27:57.386
That's not good.

27:57.427 --> 28:00.013
Sir, Jumper 8 is reporting
the enemy hive has opened fire.

28:00.055 --> 28:02.224
Friendly hive is sustaining serious damage.

28:02.266 --> 28:05.853
If they get boarded, it's all over for Atlantis.
They'll give us up for sure.

28:05.894 --> 28:09.481
Jump to their position, shields to full,
ready main rail guns, ready all missile batteries!

28:09.523 --> 28:11.441
Jumping into theater now.

28:25.330 --> 28:28.000
Get that Jumper back into bay! We're not
going to be able to keep this up for long.

28:28.041 --> 28:31.086
- Hopefully we'll give them enough time to jump into...
- Our hive is entering hyperspace.

28:39.845 --> 28:41.513
Jumper 8 has been recovered.

28:41.722 --> 28:44.349
Set course for Atlantis. Get us out of here.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.322
<i>Our delegation was searched.</i>

28:58.363 --> 29:01.867
They were killed immediately
when your canisters were discovered.

29:01.909 --> 29:04.369
<i>Our transport ship tried to escape,</i>

29:04.411 --> 29:06.205
<i>but it was destroyed.</i>

29:06.455 --> 29:09.917
You must devise a better delivery method.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.168
Or what?

29:11.335 --> 29:15.422
Or we will disclose your location to the other Wraith.

29:15.589 --> 29:17.508
We kept our part of the bargain.

29:17.549 --> 29:19.218
We gave you the retrovirus.

29:19.259 --> 29:22.137
And it is useless without an effective delivery system!

29:22.179 --> 29:24.264
So we have to do everything?

29:30.312 --> 29:33.565
Okay, okay. I will figure something out,

29:33.607 --> 29:36.527
But no more holding back. I want to know
everything there is to know about hive ships.

29:36.568 --> 29:40.322
Schematics, power distribution,
life support configurations, everything you've got.

29:40.364 --> 29:42.157
Then you shall have it.

29:42.991 --> 29:44.243
For real?

29:48.038 --> 29:49.665
Receiving transmission.

29:49.957 --> 29:51.083
Make sure it's secure.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.169
Yeah, we're completely firewalled.
Let me see that.

30:00.092 --> 30:02.469
She actually did it.
I mean, this is the motherlode!

30:02.511 --> 30:04.054
What is, exactly?

30:04.429 --> 30:08.976
Only everything you've ever wanted to know
about Wraith technology, but were afraid to ask.

30:10.853 --> 30:12.563
Why are you doing this?

30:12.688 --> 30:15.816
We have suffered extensive damage.

30:21.864 --> 30:24.366
We could render assistance

30:24.992 --> 30:26.410
<i>You would do this?</i>

30:26.451 --> 30:29.288
We're supposed to have an alliance, aren't we?

30:29.955 --> 30:35.794
Sending information on Wraith technology was
a remarkable act of good faith on your part.

30:35.836 --> 30:40.007
<i>Your assistance would be acceptable.</i>

30:40.799 --> 30:42.092
Alright, then.

30:42.634 --> 30:44.052
We have a deal.

30:57.691 --> 31:00.152
I know you guys have been
burning it at both ends, so...

31:00.194 --> 31:02.279
Dr. Vogel just went to get us some.

31:02.321 --> 31:04.364
- Thank you
- Yeah, caught him on the way in.

31:04.406 --> 31:05.908
How's it coming?

31:07.201 --> 31:08.452
It's phenomenal.

31:08.493 --> 31:11.622
It's like being handed a Wraith encyclopedia.
It's hard to know where to start.

31:11.663 --> 31:15.918
When I was a kid and I got my first
encyclopedia, I started with the letter "S".

31:16.668 --> 31:19.880
Yes, well, while I'm sure
that Wraith sexuality is interesting,

31:19.922 --> 31:21.840
we've decided to split into two teams.

31:21.882 --> 31:26.345
Team A, over here is trying to find the best
place or places to plant the gas canister

31:26.803 --> 31:31.225
and team B, over there is trying to come up
with some fixes for the damage that the Wraith hive

31:31.266 --> 31:34.061
- sustained during its last battle.
- And you?

31:34.228 --> 31:36.980
- Mostly, I'm just skimming the index.
- Anything exciting?

31:37.022 --> 31:38.649
- Oh, yes.
- Such as?

31:38.815 --> 31:40.192
Well, the ships are massive,

31:40.234 --> 31:42.277
but because of their mainly organic design,

31:42.319 --> 31:44.404
they have a number of external weaknesses.

31:44.446 --> 31:47.074
I've got a weakness for external weaknesses.

31:47.324 --> 31:50.327
- Any word from Rodney yet?
- I'm sure he's fine.

31:56.834 --> 32:00.170
The organic base of a lot of your technology, it's...

32:00.254 --> 32:01.380
it's quite amazing.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.339
Very...

32:02.840 --> 32:03.674
resilient.

32:04.466 --> 32:07.636
Many of the problems
we encounter eventually heal themselves, yes,

32:07.678 --> 32:10.472
but there are smaller, more complex issues.

32:10.848 --> 32:14.685
Such as the programming code
to make your old ships do new things?

32:14.935 --> 32:18.063
Or bypassing inoperable systems, yes.

32:18.522 --> 32:21.984
It has been so long since we have fought a real battle.

32:22.985 --> 32:23.944
Yes, well...

32:24.152 --> 32:26.780
I imagine I'd forget a lot in 10,000 years, too.

32:28.407 --> 32:32.786
Before the civil war, there were
keepers who maintained the entire fleet,

32:32.828 --> 32:34.663
but they have made their own alliances.

32:34.705 --> 32:36.039
Sorry about that.

32:36.540 --> 32:37.624
Without your help,

32:37.666 --> 32:41.503
- this damage may have been irreparable.
- Finally, an alien race that appreciates me.

32:41.920 --> 32:46.550
Do you think we will be able to come up with an
adequate delivery system for the retrovirus?

32:46.925 --> 32:47.467
Well...

32:47.509 --> 32:49.469
I know that you don't know me,
so you couldn't possibly know this but...

32:49.511 --> 32:51.763
The short answer is yes.

32:52.598 --> 32:53.432
This way.

32:54.975 --> 32:56.143
Ronon, are you crazy?

32:56.185 --> 32:57.644
Do you want us to get killed?

32:57.811 --> 32:59.146
You don't touch him.

32:59.188 --> 33:02.858
He was guiding me down the hall,
not sucking the life out of my shoulder.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.693
We are sorry.

33:04.943 --> 33:05.861
Say you're sorry.

33:06.028 --> 33:07.779
That will not be necessary.

33:08.030 --> 33:09.990
He was protecting his superior.

33:10.407 --> 33:11.491
I would have done the same.

33:11.533 --> 33:12.951
He's not my superior.

33:13.368 --> 33:16.580
Certainly not in every sense.

33:16.914 --> 33:18.582
My apologies.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.626
You wanted to take us somewhere?

33:20.667 --> 33:21.502
Please...

33:21.585 --> 33:23.170
this way.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.595
That's your sweet spot.

33:31.637 --> 33:34.556
This central chamber scrubs the
CO2 from your artificial atmosphere

33:34.598 --> 33:36.934
and redistributes it as breathable
air to the rest of the ship.

33:36.975 --> 33:39.978
If you get a sufficiently large canister of
retrovirus into that central chamber,

33:40.020 --> 33:42.606
the whole ship will be affected simultaneously.

33:42.648 --> 33:46.944
Getting to this location without
arousing suspicion will be very difficult.

33:47.319 --> 33:50.739
I'm sure it will be,
but we can't really help you with that.

33:51.073 --> 33:54.743
Although, the Colonel and I have come up
with a way to test that theory.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.245
Step one,

33:56.620 --> 34:00.916
we find another enemy hive and jump
to a location just out of its sensor range.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.836
Step two, the Daedalus takes position
in close proximity to your hive,

34:03.877 --> 34:08.215
essentially merging with your scan patterns, rendering
it practically invisible to the enemies' sensors.

34:08.257 --> 34:09.257
Step three,

34:09.299 --> 34:10.759
using sublight systems,

34:10.801 --> 34:13.094
our ships approach the target hive for

34:13.136 --> 34:14.804
whatever reason...
I'm sure you can come up with something.

34:14.847 --> 34:15.556
Step four,

34:15.597 --> 34:17.766
now that the Daedalus can use
its beaming technology again...

34:17.808 --> 34:19.226
which would be thanks to...

34:20.185 --> 34:21.478
Anyway,

34:21.520 --> 34:23.021
once we get in range,

34:23.063 --> 34:26.859
we can beam a canister
into the CO2 chamber, and boom...

34:27.525 --> 34:29.945
one hive ship de-Wraithified.

34:31.864 --> 34:33.407
Unacceptable.

34:34.533 --> 34:35.492
Excuse me?

34:36.076 --> 34:40.706
This plan keeps us completely reliant
on you to disseminate the retrovirus.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.998
<i>It's meant to be a test</i>

34:42.040 --> 34:45.085
to see if the gas works in the first place. If it does,

34:45.127 --> 34:47.880
you can come up with some other way to deliver it.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.803
Very well.

34:55.804 --> 34:59.892
I'll transmit the coordinates to our new
target as soon as I return to the hive.

34:59.933 --> 35:02.186
We'll leave as soon as you are ready.

35:09.943 --> 35:12.154
What's a girl like her do for fun?

35:13.780 --> 35:17.117
I should be on that hive when we do this.

35:17.159 --> 35:18.118
Excuse me?

35:18.160 --> 35:18.869
Really?

35:18.911 --> 35:20.537
I know it's uncharacteristically brave,

35:20.579 --> 35:23.957
but I've hacked a lot of their systems
under the guise of repairing them.

35:23.999 --> 35:27.044
I've convinced them that I should be there to
supervise their systems if anything goes wrong.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.378
And they agreed to this?

35:28.420 --> 35:29.338
Yes.

35:29.379 --> 35:31.798
Plus, now we can freely beam
stuff on and off their ships,

35:31.840 --> 35:32.883
I've written a program

35:32.925 --> 35:36.970
that will immediately beam me out of there the
second I activate this emergency transponder.

35:39.264 --> 35:40.474
You're sure you want to do this?

35:40.516 --> 35:42.100
Of course I don't want to do it.

35:42.267 --> 35:42.809
I just...

35:42.851 --> 35:44.228
I think it should be done.

35:44.645 --> 35:45.979
Ronon goes along.

35:46.647 --> 35:47.898
I wouldn't have it any other way.

35:47.940 --> 35:49.441
And I'd like you on the Daedalus.

35:49.483 --> 35:50.901
No place I'd rather be.

35:50.943 --> 35:53.403
<i>Okay. Good let's get this done.</i>

35:53.445 --> 35:56.532
I'm about ready for our house guest to leave.

36:08.210 --> 36:11.171
Hey, is your terminal...

36:13.549 --> 36:15.175
You need to see this.

36:19.388 --> 36:21.098
Oh, no.

36:21.557 --> 36:23.600
Tell me the Daedalus has not left yet.

36:31.567 --> 36:32.860
Are we there yet?

36:33.068 --> 36:35.237
Do you have any idea how difficult
these maneuvers are going to be?

36:35.279 --> 36:37.155
I'm guessing really difficult?

36:37.197 --> 36:40.784
Yeah, we're going to be flying so close to that
hive ship you'd be able to reach out and touch it.

36:40.826 --> 36:43.704
I'm gonna insist on a few practice
runs before we approach the enemy.

36:43.745 --> 36:45.455
I'm sure they're fine with that.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.708
Coming out of hyperspace.

36:48.584 --> 36:50.669
Now, get McKay on the radio. I want to...

36:54.131 --> 36:55.382
Shields to maximum!

36:55.549 --> 36:58.635
Decks 1 to 7 in the forward section have
decompressed and are venting atmosphere.

36:58.677 --> 37:01.889
Seal off those sections, get a
damage control team down there.

37:03.348 --> 37:04.433
Who's firing on us?

37:04.474 --> 37:07.102
I have two hive ships
bearing down on our position, Sir.

37:07.144 --> 37:08.562
One of them is the friendly.

37:09.605 --> 37:10.772
Not so friendly.

37:10.814 --> 37:12.941
All main weapons, fire at will on both ships.

37:12.983 --> 37:16.278
<i>Hermiod, stand by to beam</i>
<i>warheads to the nearest hive ship.</i>

37:16.653 --> 37:17.946
This doesn't make any sense.

37:18.238 --> 37:19.531
Why break the alliance now?

37:19.573 --> 37:21.742
They don't even have the gas
aboard their ship, we do.

37:21.783 --> 37:23.243
That's not my concern right now.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.833
Colonel Caldwell, this is Hermiod.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.627
The warheads are ready to deploy.

37:31.877 --> 37:33.712
Stand by till we reach optimal range.

37:33.837 --> 37:36.173
We've got to give McKay and Ronon
time to beam back aboard first.

37:36.298 --> 37:38.509
They've got until we reach
weapons deployment range.

37:38.550 --> 37:42.804
If they can't activate their
emergency transceivers by then,
there's nothing we can do about it.

37:54.608 --> 37:55.734
What was that?

37:56.151 --> 37:57.444
Activate your transceiver.

37:59.071 --> 38:00.322
Oh, no...

38:05.744 --> 38:06.787
What are you doing?

38:06.828 --> 38:09.039
I am sorry, Dr. McKay.

38:09.081 --> 38:10.249
There has been a

38:10.290 --> 38:12.751
change in plans.

38:18.257 --> 38:19.424
That's time.

38:19.842 --> 38:21.260
You got to give them a few more seconds.

38:21.301 --> 38:22.719
Sorry, Colonel. I can't do that.

38:22.761 --> 38:25.722
Hermiod, deploy warheads when ready.

38:25.764 --> 38:26.765
Colonel Caldwell,

38:26.807 --> 38:30.102
Dr. McKay's code has failed to
breach the Wraith countermeasures.

38:30.143 --> 38:32.729
I am attempting another series of codes.

38:32.938 --> 38:35.816
Work as fast as you can.
This shield ain't gonna hold up forever.

38:36.692 --> 38:40.028
With some 302s, I might be able to take
out their hyperdrive, save us some time.

38:40.070 --> 38:40.946
Do it.

38:42.406 --> 38:44.241
Shields are at 60%!

38:51.498 --> 38:53.000
<i>Dagger 2, on my lead,</i>

38:53.041 --> 38:55.377
<i>we're going to hit their stardrives,</i>
<i>where the hull is thinnest.</i>

38:55.419 --> 38:56.378
<i>I've got incoming.</i>

38:56.420 --> 38:59.089
Daggers 3 and 4, try to keep
these darts off our six.

39:17.149 --> 39:19.109
Hold on! We were supposed to be allies!

39:21.236 --> 39:24.573
I'm afraid the alliance has been dissolved.

39:24.615 --> 39:27.409
Do you have any idea how much
work I have put into all of this?

39:29.786 --> 39:31.955
I haven't slept in 36 hours!

39:32.873 --> 39:35.375
Perhaps it is better if you rest.

39:43.217 --> 39:44.885
Shields are under 20%.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.512
Hermiod, what have you got for me?

39:46.553 --> 39:51.350
I cannot guarantee that I will be able to defeat
the Wraith countermeasures in sufficient time.

39:51.391 --> 39:55.187
Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here as soon as possible.

39:56.438 --> 39:58.815
<i>Two minutes, and I can shut down their hyperdrive.</i>

39:59.608 --> 40:02.444
Unless you can shut down their weapons,
it's not going to do us much good.

40:05.197 --> 40:06.490
<i>Damn it.</i>

40:13.288 --> 40:14.331
Sheppard?

40:16.333 --> 40:17.376
Sheppard?

40:17.501 --> 40:19.211
I'm not getting anything, Sir.

40:20.754 --> 40:21.922
Prepare to jump on my mark.

40:21.964 --> 40:24.716
Sir, the hives are opening hyperspace windows.

40:42.234 --> 40:43.944
Why the hell'd they do that?

40:44.319 --> 40:46.780
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, Sir.

40:46.822 --> 40:47.656
Sheppard?

40:47.698 --> 40:49.199
His fighter isn't one of them.

40:49.575 --> 40:52.744
The only contacts I have on screen are wreckage.

40:52.911 --> 40:54.454
What about his locator beacon?

40:54.788 --> 40:56.123
No. Nothing, Sir.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.584
He's just gone.

41:01.003 --> 41:02.462
Understood.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.467
Set course for Atlantis.

41:09.469 --> 41:11.054
We got hacked.

41:11.221 --> 41:14.057
Within the hive ship schematics
was a worm-like computer virus.

41:14.099 --> 41:15.392
Your people went over the data.

41:15.434 --> 41:17.186
I know. We thought it was clean,

41:17.227 --> 41:19.396
but this virus was entirely different.

41:19.730 --> 41:20.606
What did it do?

41:20.647 --> 41:24.985
It very selectively probed our systems
without damaging them or exposing itself.

41:25.027 --> 41:28.113
I don't understand. If you didn't
find it, and it didn't reveal itself...

41:28.155 --> 41:30.115
Once the hive left Atlantis,

41:30.157 --> 41:33.410
the worm began to destroy
all of the data they had sent down.

41:33.702 --> 41:35.954
Then this was their plan all along.

41:37.789 --> 41:38.957
What did they get?

41:38.999 --> 41:40.834
This is one of the reasons we didn't detect it.

41:40.876 --> 41:43.420
They only uploaded two pieces of information...

41:43.504 --> 41:46.006
One, the Aurora mission reports...

41:46.673 --> 41:47.716
Okay.

41:47.841 --> 41:49.176
And two?

41:51.678 --> 41:54.598
The location of every world in our database.

42:07.569 --> 42:09.154
Are you okay?

42:12.783 --> 42:13.492
No.

42:13.742 --> 42:17.371
No, I think this is the most "not okay"
I have ever been.

42:19.581 --> 42:21.625
I see you have awakened.

42:22.000 --> 42:22.918
Really?

42:23.335 --> 42:25.420
I was sort of hoping this was just a nightmare.

42:26.213 --> 42:27.840
Why aren't we dead?

42:28.340 --> 42:33.470
The queen wants you to live long enough
to witness the fruits of your labor.

42:33.637 --> 42:36.056
If it wasn't for you, Dr. McKay,

42:36.098 --> 42:38.934
we would never have been able to get there.

42:38.976 --> 42:41.228
What are you talking about get where?

42:43.397 --> 42:45.190
Earth.

42:52.447 --> 42:56.034
.

42:56.535 --> 43:01.331
... See you next season ...
... Hugs and kisses to everyone ...

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
