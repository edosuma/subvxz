Treiber won't let us
do anything without House.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.020
House just took himself
off the case.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.071
You said no bowel sounds
when you examined him.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.236
No, like "diminished",
or "none at all"?
None.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.575
You think it's
an intussusception?

13:48.662 --> 13:51.244
If it is, it could mean
cancer's behind everything.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.491
Let's get a plain film
of his abdomen.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.322
Treiber will refuse
any procedure

13:54.418 --> 13:55.828
that wasn't ordered
by House.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.580
Only if he knows
it wasn't.

13:57.671 --> 14:01.004
You want to lie to a guy
whose favorite pastime
is getting doctors fired?

14:01.091 --> 14:03.503
We're adults with
advanced medical training,

14:03.593 --> 14:05.254
not children left alone
with scissors.

It's one X-ray.

we could've found somewhere
a little less charming.

playing Angry Birds.

you not wanting me
to have a phone.

You're weak.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.534
You knew that
you'd backslide

14:31.621 --> 14:33.873

talking to teary ex-wives,

14:33.957 --> 14:34.946

make them feel better
about you being sick.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.787

I'll have that.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.418
I'll have The Big One.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.545
You sure? It's $79.

Unless
I finish it in an hour,
in which case, it's free.

It's an 80 ounce steak.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.308
And an iced tea,
please.

going to be free,

I have drawers
filled with people
who had clean scans.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.391
I know how easy it is
to miss something

15:44.486 --> 15:46.522
unless you use your
own hands and eyes.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.520
Run my bowel.
We'll let House
know how you feel.

15:48.698 --> 15:52.111
How I feel is twisted
in white, hot agony.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.701
His orders
were to look for
an intussusception.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.663
Until you actually do that,
I refuse any other tests.

the more damage

Treiber's too good
to not take the right
precautions.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.433
Maybe the problem is
he thinks the same thing.

25:28.778 --> 25:31.019
His job's built
on the premise that
doctors make mistakes.

25:31.114 --> 25:32.194
That includes him.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.855
We should do
a brain biopsy.
In his condition?

25:33.950 --> 25:35.531
Then we biopsy
the brains in the morgue.

25:35.618 --> 25:36.698
Find the one
that exposed him.

25:36.786 --> 25:37.866

at least start him

25:40.248 --> 25:41.863
on amphotericin
to halt the progress

25:41.958 --> 25:43.118
while you do
your heart biopsy.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.121
No, we can't.
Amphotericin plus the
contrast dye for the biopsy

25:46.212 --> 25:49.124
would overwhelm his kidneys.
We have to choose
one or the other.

25:51.718 --> 25:52.878

a prion disease.
