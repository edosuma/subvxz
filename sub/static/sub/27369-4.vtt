02:32.736 --> 02:34.112
Agent:<i> Tommy, how far do you live</i>

02:34.196 --> 02:37.032
<i>from the power plant</i>
<i>where Denice Haraway was killed?</i>

02:37.115 --> 02:40.452
Tommy Ward: <i>I live about,</i>
<i>I estimate, about two blocks--</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:42.412
<i>Not too far at all.</i>

02:42.496 --> 02:44.331
Agent: <i>Are you familiar with the area?</i>
Tommy: <i>Across the highway.</i>

02:44.414 --> 02:45.248
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

02:59.971 --> 03:02.891
<i>They told me that</i>
<i>we had to get rid of her and all.</i>

03:03.183 --> 03:05.477
<i>And asked me a good place</i>
<i>to get rid of her.</i>

03:06.019 --> 03:10.023
<i>I told them about a house</i>
<i>and about this ditch down by the...</i>

05:56.857 --> 06:00.569
Tommy Ward: In the confession,
I stated that we planned to go out there,

06:00.652 --> 06:02.988
and rob the store and...

06:03.238 --> 06:05.615
took her so she couldn't identify us.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.160
Then took her a mile west of Ada
to the power plant,

06:09.244 --> 06:12.205
where we raped her,
stabbed her to death,

06:12.289 --> 06:14.457
and dumped the body a mile west of Ada.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.337
The reason why the stabbing came up is
because I used to collect knives.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.548
I guess somebody might have told them

06:21.798 --> 06:23.633
about me collecting knives.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.771
That's how the stabbing come in,

06:37.606 --> 06:39.024
by the police telling me that

06:39.107 --> 06:41.443
that's what they believed
had happened, you know.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.439
Once they found the body I thought,

07:19.522 --> 07:22.150
well now they're going to really see
that we didn't do it because...

07:22.233 --> 07:26.321
now here they've found the body
in a whole different location--

07:26.404 --> 07:28.990
Because we was accused of
taking her a mile west of Ada--

07:29.074 --> 07:31.868
Now here they find her
45 miles east of Ada,

07:31.993 --> 07:33.495
plus a whole different homicide

07:33.578 --> 07:35.789
because they are sayin'
she'd been shut in the head.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.875
And I thought that right there
was gonna prove we didn't do it.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.735
They turned around,
and when I went back on that retrial

11:33.818 --> 11:37.906
they charged me with the shooting,
since they found her being shot.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.499
What really distraughted me is,

13:54.042 --> 13:56.377
you know, thinking that...

13:57.587 --> 13:59.464
that people would even think that

13:59.547 --> 14:02.216
I could be even capable of
doing such a thing.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.179
That's-- things like that

14:06.304 --> 14:08.723
I was thinking all throughout the trial,
you know.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.393
I couldn't believe it, you know.
I kept telling myself,

14:12.560 --> 14:14.562
man this... no way, you know,

14:15.521 --> 14:18.274
that these jurors would even
find me guilty or anything

14:18.608 --> 14:20.818
because I didn't do it,
and they're gonna see

14:20.985 --> 14:23.446
this is a bunch of lies
and a bunch of bull.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.747
I guess I just wasn't really living
in the reality.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.879
I was shocked,
I started crying.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.758
I was praying and I said,

14:43.841 --> 14:46.219
"God, please show these people

14:46.386 --> 14:48.388
that we didn't do it."

14:50.098 --> 14:51.391
It's been rough.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.645
A lot of people come in and say,
"Tommy, how in the world do you do it?"

14:58.981 --> 15:02.860
My only explanation is knowing
that God knows the truth, you know.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.114
And he's the one who gives me
the strength to carry me through.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.918
<i>I'm ok, it was sure good</i>
<i>to see y'all yesterday.</i>

16:25.568 --> 16:28.279
<i>I'm having to start</i>
<i>to gather a little bit of letters</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:30.865
<i>that I've been writing</i>
<i>to the parole board myself.</i>

16:31.240 --> 16:35.036
<i>I'm going to read it to them</i>
<i>if they hear, Pardon and Parole board.</i>

16:35.912 --> 16:37.914
<i>My name is Thomas Ward.</i>

16:38.039 --> 16:41.000
<i>I have spent the last 34 years in prison,</i>

16:41.167 --> 16:45.671
<i>after being convicted in April 1984...</i>

16:47.256 --> 16:51.552
<i>of robbery, kidnapping and</i>
<i>the murder charge of Donna Denice Haraway.</i>

17:09.445 --> 17:11.864
<i>And I would pray for</i>
<i>a second chance in life</i>

17:11.948 --> 17:15.701
<i>and to be of service</i>
<i>for my community.</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:17.787
<i>Asking for your consideration.</i>

17:17.870 --> 17:19.830
<i>Respectfully, Thomas Ward.</i>

17:21.082 --> 17:22.500
<i>How does it sound?</i>

26:16.950 --> 26:18.243
<i>Let's go ahead and begin.</i>

26:18.327 --> 26:21.371
<i>Feel free to drink your Coke</i>
<i>or have a cigarette as you talk,</i>

26:21.455 --> 26:23.373
<i>whatever makes you feel more comfortable.</i>

26:26.627 --> 26:28.462
<i>Should I start with the date?</i>

26:29.338 --> 26:30.255
<i>That's fine.</i>

27:04.998 --> 27:07.459
<i>I was at a keg party.</i>

27:08.043 --> 27:09.837
<i>And I ran into a couple of guys,</i>

27:09.920 --> 27:12.965
<i>one of them's name is Titsdale, and--</i>

27:22.266 --> 27:24.268
Agent: <i>Tommy, excuse me,</i>
<i>before you get started,</i>

27:24.351 --> 27:26.228
<i>you said, "Titsdale"?</i>

27:27.563 --> 27:29.648
<i>-Titsworth.</i>
<i>-What's his first name?</i>

27:32.359 --> 27:33.819
I can't recall it, uh--

27:33.902 --> 27:35.154
<i>-Was it Odell?</i>
<i>-Odell.</i>

27:47.916 --> 27:51.086
<i>As we was going to McAnally's,</i>
<i>we stopped there at the apartments...</i>

27:51.962 --> 27:53.797
<i>and decided to smoke some pot</i>

27:53.881 --> 27:56.300
<i>and get high and everything.</i>
<i>We drank some.</i>

27:58.177 --> 28:00.721
<i>Then when we got--</i>
<i>We planned it out before we got there.</i>

28:01.722 --> 28:02.973
<i>Then when we got there...</i>

28:04.016 --> 28:04.850
<i>Odell...</i>

28:05.726 --> 28:07.519
<i>set it up for us and everything.</i>

28:58.862 --> 29:00.614
Agent:<i> Can you tell me</i>
<i>what her blouse looked like?</i>

29:00.697 --> 29:01.698
<i>That she was wearing?</i>

29:02.199 --> 29:03.075
<i>It was...</i>

29:05.118 --> 29:05.953
<i>It was...</i>

29:06.620 --> 29:07.996
<i>white with little blue...</i>

29:09.790 --> 29:10.874
<i>roses on it.</i>

29:11.291 --> 29:12.542
<i>White with blue roses.</i>

29:12.626 --> 29:14.795
<i>-Button-up or slip-on?</i>
<i>-Button-up.</i>

29:15.045 --> 29:17.047
<i>Did it have buttons on the collars?</i>

29:17.172 --> 29:18.632
<i>Or was it just a regular collar?</i>

29:18.715 --> 29:21.760
<i>It had buttons on the collars</i>
<i>and then it had little fringe deals</i>

29:21.843 --> 29:24.680
<i>around her collar</i>
<i>and around the end of her arm.</i>

29:24.763 --> 29:26.431
Agent:<i> What kind of shirt did she have on?</i>

29:26.515 --> 29:28.475
<i>Was it pull-over type</i>
<i>or button-up type?</i>

29:28.558 --> 29:29.393
<i>Button-up.</i>

29:29.685 --> 29:34.231
<i>Did it have anything that you noticed</i>
<i>about it as far as any designs or...</i>

29:34.314 --> 29:37.359
<i>Just the ruffles around the buttons</i>
<i>and the sleeves.</i>

29:37.859 --> 29:39.778
<i>The sleeves had elastic, like, in 'em.</i>

29:39.861 --> 29:42.906
<i>-Short-sleeve shirt?</i>
<i>-Yes. It was short-sleeve.</i>

29:44.032 --> 29:45.784
<i>Did it have any lace around the collar?</i>

29:46.326 --> 29:48.870
<i>Yes, it had ruffles around the collar,</i>
<i>like the front.</i>

31:36.645 --> 31:40.440
That's the main thing I wanted to do,
was to go take care of mom--

31:40.857 --> 31:42.776
You know, be with her,
you know, 'cause--

31:43.276 --> 31:45.570
That's it, she's 97 years old,

31:45.695 --> 31:48.573
I don't know how much longer
she'll be around.

31:49.825 --> 31:53.453
I pray to God that
her wishes will come true.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.873
Seeing the day that I do,

31:56.957 --> 31:59.334
live to see that I did get out of here.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.375
Tommy:<i> Hey, how you doin'?</i>

33:52.405 --> 33:54.407
<i>It's been good to hear your voice.</i>

33:54.616 --> 33:56.493
<i>Take care and thank you.</i>
