Your setup is,

02:01.154 --> 02:03.423
Why, you ask?
- Yeah, why?

02:03.456 --> 02:06.059
- Well, chickens are strange.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.194
Now, this chicken
heard a scratching noise

02:08.228 --> 02:11.164
from way across the road,
and it was driving him nuts.

02:11.197 --> 02:14.067
He was all like, "I gotta see
what's making that noise."

02:14.067 --> 02:16.670
So he crossed,
and the noise got louder.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.505
And he followed it,
and it got louder.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.173
And eventually, he discovered

02:20.206 --> 02:22.709
that it was a tree
blowing in the wind

02:22.742 --> 02:24.210
rubbing against an old barn.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.945
He thought to himself, "Huh.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.448
That's funny that tree can make
that scratching noise."

02:31.084 --> 02:32.986
Anyway, he was just
a dumb chicken,

he crossed the road.

and have a good time.

Well, Brent, what's the most
embarrassing thing

06:34.794 --> 06:36.062
Lexi has ever done to you?

06:36.096 --> 06:37.297
- Oh, wow.

She's done a lot
of embarrassing things to me.

She--she actually did--
didn't you prank me

06:43.136 --> 06:44.504
on my birthday
where you smashed a cake

06:44.537 --> 06:47.140
in my face
in front of literally everyone?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.020
- No, you.

You--he will show up
to my house

07:02.022 --> 07:05.058
when I am dead asleep
in the bed

07:05.091 --> 07:07.027

with a mariachi band.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.795

07:08.828 --> 07:10.597
- You need to have security
around there.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.932
You need to have
security escort him.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.134

07:14.167 --> 07:15.635
when they're sleeping,
you know.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.038

I mean you can't lie, that...

[imitating mariachi music]

07:21.107 --> 07:22.609
- Exactly, exactly.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.210
- Here's my prank idea.

07:24.244 --> 07:28.214
I would drench one of you
in slime.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.316
all: Oh, no.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.685
- Yea? Nay?

07:31.718 --> 07:34.521
- I actually just recently did
a slime water park

07:34.554 --> 07:38.324
in the backyard where
instead of water, we use slime.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.060
<i>It was a blast. Right, guys?</i>

07:40.060 --> 07:41.394

07:44.164 --> 07:46.833
- It got stuck
in my hair for days.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.301
- What happens
if it gets in your hair?

07:48.335 --> 07:50.537
- Oh, it's, fine, it's--
it washes out, right?

07:50.570 --> 07:51.671
- Yeah, sure.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.606
- Yeah, you have
to take two showers.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.743
- It's like shampoo,
but, like, a green shampoo.

07:56.776 --> 08:01.014
- So do you want to see
my prank on you guys?

08:01.014 --> 08:03.016
<i>- Sure.</i>
<i>- All right. Let's do it.</i>

08:03.049 --> 08:05.385

- Aw!

08:25.605 --> 08:27.374
It's a natural disaster
in the house.

08:27.407 --> 08:31.578
- Hey, that was a good prank.
- What did I tell you, man?

08:31.611 --> 08:35.048
- Give it up for Dylan.
all: Yeah!

08:35.048 --> 08:36.750

<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>That's pretty awesome.</i>

08:42.856 --> 08:44.424

for building

08:44.457 --> 08:46.292
a huge fan base on YouTube?

08:46.326 --> 08:47.460
- Pierson?

08:47.494 --> 08:48.895
- I mean, really just
being yourself

08:48.928 --> 08:50.263
is the most important thing,

08:50.296 --> 08:52.065
because people want to build
a connection with you,

08:52.098 --> 08:54.167
and if you can make someone
laugh or smile

08:54.200 --> 08:56.169
or entertain them
or inform them in any way,

08:56.202 --> 08:58.071
<i>I think that's</i>
<i>the best way to gain</i>

08:58.104 --> 08:59.239

08:59.272 --> 09:00.740
- Wow.
- Wow.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.841
- Yes.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.078
- What is it like having
your own TV show?

- Oh, yeah.

<i>- You guys look like you</i>
<i>are absolutely a great job.</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:10.183
- It--I mean, it's amazing.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.018
- Sometimes,
it's really tempting

09:12.052 --> 09:13.687
because we have
a set full of candy

09:13.720 --> 09:17.190
and they tell us--they tell us
not to eat the whole set,

09:17.223 --> 09:19.793
so I mean, sometimes
it's really tempting.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.528
- Where's my invite?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.396
- And it's so fun going
in the ball pit, man.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.765
It just so--it is
so much fun stuff here.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.134
They got pictures of us, like,
as babies, man.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.438
So you know.
- You. Only you.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.406

was wondering

09:33.440 --> 09:34.941
if he could be a host

09:35.041 --> 09:37.310
on a next season's show,
right, Jeremy?

09:37.344 --> 09:39.679
- Hey, what's going on?
- Definitely, man.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.315
- Totally--you guys
will fit right in.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.050
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

09:44.084 --> 09:45.051
- Let's go!

[cheers and applause]

10:17.083 --> 10:19.619
- Amp World, are you up

is called Kids Survey.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.631
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

10:31.664 --> 10:34.367
We went out and surveyed kids
about what they like to eat

10:34.401 --> 10:37.137
or play or whatever.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.372
And we found out is,

10:39.406 --> 10:41.474
kids are weird.
- Yeah.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.977
- Like--like, seriously weird.

10:44.010 --> 10:48.248
This game, we put the other
hosts versus Amp World.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.350
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

10:50.383 --> 10:54.054
And each team has to guess
all ten of our kids'

10:54.087 --> 10:57.157
survey answers in 30 seconds
to win a point.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.159
Y'all up for it,
Amp World and host?

10:59.192 --> 11:00.660

- Get ready to lose.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.431
- Okay, Amp World can go first.

11:04.464 --> 11:09.336
Our survey asked some kids
to name 10 good pizza toppings.

11:09.369 --> 11:14.541
You guys ready?
30 seconds. And go.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.728

You did pretty good, Amp World.
You did pretty good.

11:55.315 --> 11:59.419
But you missed nail clippings
and low-fat mayonnaise.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.954
[laughter]

12:01.054 --> 12:02.355
- Nail clippings?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.157

12:04.190 --> 12:05.658
don't even show that face, man.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.827
These kids are a bunch
of weirdos.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.963
I'm telling you.

12:10.063 --> 12:15.502
All right, hosts, your topic is
10 nicknames for grandmothers.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.837

12:51.471 --> 12:54.441
- And then you missed
great-great grandma's daughter.

12:54.474 --> 12:58.211
So that means, I think,
Amp World won this one, man.
