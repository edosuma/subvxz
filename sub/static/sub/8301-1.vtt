<i> The West </i>

01:24.783 --> 01:28.787
<i> Our ranch was located several miles
north of Divide, </i>

01:28.995 --> 01:31.414
<i> lost in the Pioneer Mountains. </i>

01:38.421 --> 01:40.924
<i> The closest thing to traffic was when </i>

01:41.133 --> 01:43.218
<i> Union Pacific Freight trains rumbled through the valley. </i>

01:43.510 --> 01:45.095
<i> at 5: 44 am </i>

01:46.638 --> 01:48.348
<i> 11: 53 am, </i>

01:49.474 --> 01:51.309
<i> 5: 15 pm. </i>

01:52.936 --> 01:56.231
<i> Divide was literally located
on the continent of the divide.</i>

01:56.940 --> 01:59.818
<i> To the east, rivers spill into the Atlantic. </i>

02:00.026 --> 02:02.487
<i> To the west, it is spill into the Pacific. </i>

02:03.989 --> 02:06.908
<i> One day my brother Layton

02:07.075 --> 02:08.827
<i> christian its natural water. </i>

02:15.667 --> 02:17.127
Look over here.

02:17.335 --> 02:18.587
Hello Big Sur!

02:18.795 --> 02:20.589
Hello New Orleans!

02:29.306 --> 02:31.475
<i> But Layton's favourite pastime </i>

02:31.683 --> 02:33.852
<i> was shooting at anything that moved. </i>

02:45.238 --> 02:46.281
Big loop.

02:46.490 --> 02:47.824
Elbow up.

02:51.077 --> 02:51.953
Ready?

02:53.121 --> 02:53.872
Now!

02:59.428 --> 03:01.226
Go!

03:09.304 --> 03:10.263
Stop!

03:10.639 --> 03:12.474
<i> Upon my brothers request, </i>

03:12.682 --> 03:14.893
<i>father built us a seesaw. </i>

03:17.604 --> 03:18.382
Slow down!

03:18.632 --> 03:19.595
Come on, cowboy.

03:19.762 --> 03:21.733
<i> My father loved Layton </i>

03:21.983 --> 03:24.319
<i>more than anything in the world. </i>

03:24.486 --> 03:25.779
Yes , Good deal.

03:33.328 --> 03:35.872
<i>I would have liked
to be a daredevil, too. </i>

03:36.081 --> 03:37.874
<i>But I knew I never be upto it.</i>

03:40.210 --> 03:42.087
<i> One year earlier </i>

03:46.716 --> 03:49.719
<i> Orffyreus have five marbles
trapped in tubes, </i>

03:49.928 --> 03:53.223
<i> creating an imbalance.
This rocking motion, however, </i>

03:53.431 --> 03:56.143
<i> caused the energy to dissipate. </i>

03:56.351 --> 03:59.563
<i>Robert  Flux built a mill
based on the concept </i>

03:59.771 --> 04:00.772
<i> of perpetual rotation. </i>

04:00.939 --> 04:05.360
<i> However the inherit friction of the machine
caused  significant loss of energy. </i>

04:05.694 --> 04:07.988
<i> Italian philosopher Marco Zimara </i>

04:08.196 --> 04:10.824
<i> imagined a machine that could
recycle the wind. </i>

04:11.032 --> 04:13.702
<i> But the force required
to compress the bellows </i>

04:13.910 --> 04:15.954
<i> was greater than the energy produced by the windmill. </i>

04:16.829 --> 04:18.623
<i>So it didn't work.</i>

04:25.422 --> 04:27.757
<i> No scientific challenge
remains greater, </i>

04:27.966 --> 04:29.009
<i> most prestigious, </i>

04:29.676 --> 04:30.510
<i> more mythical, </i>

04:30.719 --> 04:32.971
<i> than that of finding the key to </i>

04:33.180 --> 04:35.056
<i> perpetual motion. </i>

04:45.150 --> 04:47.319
Yet some affirm that

04:47.527 --> 04:50.071
this quest is doomed to failure.

04:50.489 --> 04:51.781
Such a machine

04:51.990 --> 04:54.451
defies the laws of the universe.

04:54.659 --> 04:57.954
The very basis of thermodynamics
assumes that

04:58.163 --> 05:00.999
all mechanism will
eventually come to stop.

05:04.169 --> 05:07.047
Given the current state of Science
and Technology,

05:07.255 --> 05:09.966
isn't the quest for perpetual motion
better suited for

05:10.133 --> 05:13.887
idealists and poets
than real scientists?

05:17.390 --> 05:21.019
What if imagination start it

05:21.311 --> 05:22.687
and science end it?

05:23.355 --> 05:26.983
Those who push the boundaries of science,
what they not all poets?

05:27.484 --> 05:28.568
I'm certain

05:28.735 --> 05:31.947
that as we speak here today,
that somewhere in this country,

05:32.155 --> 05:34.241
a budding Leonardo Da Vinci

05:34.449 --> 05:36.743
is gaining up for the challenge.

05:38.344 --> 05:39.344
Thank you very much.

05:41.832 --> 05:42.833
Oh God ...

05:47.442 --> 05:47.942
Hello.

05:48.463 --> 05:51.341
Sir, I am the Leonardo from Montana.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.468
Oh yeah? What you are going to do?

05:53.677 --> 05:55.262
I accept the challenge.

05:56.555 --> 05:57.681
You do?

06:21.454 --> 06:23.874
<i> One afternoon in August,
the phone rang </i>

06:24.082 --> 06:25.876
<i> while my sister Gracie and I </i>

06:26.084 --> 06:29.004
<i> on the porch, shredding sweet corn
into large metal buckets. </i>

06:34.468 --> 06:35.469
What?

06:37.053 --> 06:40.640
<i> the buckets were riddled with
bite marks dating back to last spring </i>

06:40.849 --> 06:43.685
<i> when our dog Tapioca got depressed </i>

06:43.894 --> 06:46.021
<i> and started eating metal. </i>

07:14.007 --> 07:15.509
Gracie, can you hold this for a second.

07:20.639 --> 07:22.265
This is what I predicted.

07:22.474 --> 07:24.184
Manticora herculeana

07:24.392 --> 07:27.437
is a subspecies of cicindeler.

07:28.522 --> 07:29.689
Who was at that called ?

07:29.898 --> 07:33.026
Same time,
has a heart at tip of the mandible

07:33.735 --> 07:36.279
doesn't seem to have a white spot on the electra.

07:36.488 --> 07:37.280
Mom?

07:38.323 --> 07:39.950
The phone, who was it?

07:41.535 --> 07:42.577
Oh, a call for T.S.

07:45.664 --> 07:47.207
A call for him?

07:50.085 --> 07:50.836
Who was it?

07:53.171 --> 07:54.464
I do not know.

07:54.923 --> 07:57.300
She is still in the line.
she is waiting.

07:58.009 --> 07:59.636
You should probably go.

08:00.595 --> 08:04.891
If you finish before I get back, count the
number of good ears and the number of bad ones.

08:05.684 --> 08:07.811
Why don't get the kernels,
while you're at it?

08:10.897 --> 08:13.483
<i> I had 3 options
to get to the phone. </i>

08:13.775 --> 08:15.652
<i> The corridor / kitchen way, </i>

08:15.861 --> 08:18.280
<i>the quickest
but also the most boring. </i>

08:19.030 --> 08:21.658
<i> Upstairs /Downstairs route, </i>

08:21.867 --> 08:25.412
<i> but the shift in altitude made me nauseous.</i>

08:26.538 --> 08:29.291
<i> I opted for the third and
riskiest, </i>

08:29.416 --> 08:31.918
<i> particularly when father was working
around the house. </i>

08:34.629 --> 08:37.048
<i>The scent in room smelled like
whiskey stained leather.</i>

08:37.674 --> 08:39.384
<i> and moldy photographs.</i>

08:57.194 --> 08:58.945
<i> If you just closed your eyes, </i>

08:59.362 --> 09:01.948
<i> you could feel the dust forming onto your prairie </i>

09:02.157 --> 09:04.784
<i> after a cowboy posse cavalcade.</i>

09:06.995 --> 09:10.415
<i> Layton use this thing as setting room,
was the greatest thing since</i>

09:10.999 --> 09:12.626
<i> quirrell trees. </i>

09:23.804 --> 09:26.932
I would like to speak to T.S. Spivet,
this is Miss Jibsen,

09:27.265 --> 09:29.726
Under Secretary of the Smithsonian.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.353
Hold on.

09:33.104 --> 09:33.772
Father!

09:34.105 --> 09:35.106
Phone!

09:49.913 --> 09:52.040
My father is all yours, Ms. Jibsen.

09:52.165 --> 09:53.625
Hello, Mr. Spivet.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.545
Yes! My dad is listening.

09:58.713 --> 10:00.382
Could you hand him the phone please.

10:02.008 --> 10:04.469
No! My father is mute, Ms. Jibsen.

10:05.011 --> 10:08.473
He can hear you
but can only respond in sign language.

10:09.349 --> 10:10.934
I will translate everything for you.

10:13.395 --> 10:16.064
You are the T.S. Spivet

10:16.773 --> 10:19.818
that has just invent the magnetic wheel?

10:20.152 --> 10:22.237
One second. Father saying ...

10:22.654 --> 10:25.782
Yes, I only sent you the blueprints.

10:25.907 --> 10:28.326
Because , I didn't have the time to do it.

10:31.496 --> 10:33.123
The quest for perpetual movement!

10:33.290 --> 10:35.667
I mean, Its the Holy Grail of inventors ...

10:36.251 --> 10:39.504
Tell me Mr.Spivet, I take it you live
in Montana?

10:39.838 --> 10:41.173
Coppertop ranch.

10:41.381 --> 10:46.052
Longitude: 112° 44' 19".

10:46.261 --> 10:48.346
Latitude: 45° 44' 27".

10:50.557 --> 10:52.434
These are the coordinates to my bedroom.

10:54.394 --> 10:55.937
Wow! Clearly you have an eye for detail!

10:56.354 --> 10:57.772
which is a reckless ad for

10:57.981 --> 10:59.858
any great inventor.

11:00.609 --> 11:02.527
Father is asking:

11:02.736 --> 11:06.406
so you are the head of the Smithsonian?

11:07.073 --> 11:09.534
Well! Technically,
I'm the Under Secretary, but,

11:10.118 --> 11:11.870
many people would say I run the place.

11:13.111 --> 11:13.704
Wow

11:14.537 --> 11:15.218
Yeah.

11:19.216 --> 11:20.508
Look Mr.Spivet,

11:20.543 --> 11:21.838
your invention

11:22.422 --> 11:25.342
has won our prestigious Baird Award.

11:28.053 --> 11:30.263
Spencer Baird Award?

11:30.639 --> 11:31.848
Indeed.

11:32.516 --> 11:36.853
Our 150th anniversary gala
is in a week's time

11:37.062 --> 11:39.272
and this would be perfect oppurtunity
for you to

11:39.481 --> 11:41.358
You know
Make your acceptance speech.

11:43.939 --> 11:44.861
Of course, we would

11:45.362 --> 11:47.405
provide you with a
sign language interpreter.

11:49.866 --> 11:50.560
But ...

11:51.368 --> 11:52.536
I'll be in class.

11:53.286 --> 11:54.913
I go back to school on Monday.

11:55.872 --> 11:58.750
You must teach
at the University of Montana?

11:58.959 --> 12:01.628
A quick phone call to your president,
Jack Campbell,

12:02.629 --> 12:04.005
and it will be taken care of.
I mean,

12:05.048 --> 12:08.426
We are talking about
the Baird Award after all.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.181
<i> Prairie of Truth </i>

12:14.015 --> 12:15.600
<i> Mountain of Lies </i>

12:24.860 --> 12:26.862
I was just thinking.

12:28.071 --> 12:30.615
I can't come out to receive the Baird award.

12:32.117 --> 12:34.327
I have too much work to finish.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.454
Thanks anyway.

12:36.773 --> 12:37.831
Have a good day.

12:44.713 --> 12:46.006
What are you doing?

12:46.840 --> 12:48.258
What do you think I am doing?

12:49.759 --> 12:51.011
You are going to mess up my dataset.

12:53.138 --> 12:54.556
You're in there for like 15 hours.

12:54.764 --> 12:56.016
Who was that?

12:57.809 --> 13:00.520
A journalist ... From New York.

13:00.729 --> 13:03.607
Wants me to go there
for an interview about my work.

13:04.983 --> 13:06.860
<i> Inside Gracie's  cortex</i>

13:07.068 --> 13:09.696
Just laugh in his face, its the only way to deal with this.

13:09.863 --> 13:12.115
Clearly he is making it up.

13:12.365 --> 13:13.783
And if it were true?

13:14.075 --> 13:16.953
You mean this total spass leaving
Montana before us?

13:17.162 --> 13:19.122
Would it be so bad to be a celebrity sister?

13:19.331 --> 13:22.209
This total dork, invited to New York ...

13:22.667 --> 13:24.169
for an interview?

13:25.143 --> 13:26.129
You're full crap.

13:26.296 --> 13:29.341
I told her I can't come,
cause' classes are again monday,

13:29.549 --> 13:31.009
but she was insisting.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.263
What did I do to god for hate me?
It's like

13:35.597 --> 13:37.808
"Here, Gracie, I found you
a family full of nutjobs,"

13:38.016 --> 13:40.393
"And you are gonna live in no worse in Montana"

13:40.602 --> 13:43.313
"and your brother, who is a
total spat"

13:43.522 --> 13:44.606
"is going to New York!"

13:44.815 --> 13:47.776
I told you I am not going
I've got a school.

13:48.193 --> 13:50.403

15:22.537 --> 15:26.374
Is it even conceivable that the cowboy museum
or rather, mausoleum

15:26.583 --> 15:28.627
could be turned into a normal living room

15:28.835 --> 15:30.253
where normal people

15:30.462 --> 15:32.756
could relax and have normal conversation?

<i> My father, Tecumseh Elijah Spivet, </i>

<i> For him talking was a necessary chore, </i>

15:52.734 --> 15:54.361

17:02.095 --> 17:04.222
to prove that tigermonk cicindele's exist

17:04.431 --> 17:05.848
Stopped everything?

17:06.057 --> 17:07.392
What do you mean, in a

17:07.601 --> 17:09.895
maternal sense or a scientific one?

17:12.606 --> 17:14.608
What is it that you want me
to start doing again?

17:14.816 --> 17:16.026
Or else I stopped doing?

17:18.236 --> 17:18.987
I don't know.

17:19.738 --> 17:22.656
Your research on the
parasitic scolyte catepiller maybe?

17:23.157 --> 17:25.868
Your findings could've saved
all the pine trees in Montana.

17:26.203 --> 17:28.246
Every other scientific attempt
have failed.

17:28.788 --> 17:29.706
Failed?

17:30.248 --> 17:32.209
Form the ecologists
point of view, maybe.

17:32.417 --> 17:33.877
But from the caterpillar's
point of view,

17:34.085 --> 17:35.670
looks like a win win situation.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.632
Anyway I never liked pine trees.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.383
They're dripy and sticky.

17:40.884 --> 17:42.928
Some things are just meant to die.

17:44.679 --> 17:47.933
<i> How my parents ever fell for each other
is a mystery. </i>

17:50.268 --> 17:52.604
<i> They were like day and night. </i>

18:04.741 --> 18:06.952
The human head lice,
Pediculus humanus capitis

18:07.160 --> 18:08.745
belong to the Anoplura family.

18:09.246 --> 18:11.414
A. N. O. P. L. U. R. A.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.084
T.S., When you drawing the legs,

18:14.292 --> 18:17.838
make sure you observe not just how many there are
but the exact distance between them.

18:18.213 --> 18:20.507
Yeah. The exact distance
between them.

18:22.259 --> 18:24.094
Beware of mediocrity,

18:24.302 --> 18:26.096
its the fungus of the mind.

18:26.304 --> 18:27.973
We must constantly fight
against it

18:28.181 --> 18:29.683
or creeping to everything we do.

18:30.642 --> 18:31.518
Darn!

18:33.145 --> 18:34.521
Those got away.

18:36.421 --> 18:37.675
A lasso to catch him.

18:41.278 --> 18:42.445
Thanks, Dad.

18:42.654 --> 18:46.154
A fool, by definition is the one who turns,
what is beyond his middle grasp,

18:46.154 --> 18:47.909
will do one big joke.

18:51.705 --> 18:55.041
<i> Then a few days later,
at the end of the hallway, </i>

18:55.208 --> 18:57.419
<i> their hands brushed against
each other, </i>

18:58.253 --> 19:01.590
<i> as if they were secretly exchanging
a few seeds. </i>

19:32.829 --> 19:34.456
<i> And then there was Layton, </i>

19:34.664 --> 19:36.500
<i> my dizygotic twin. </i>

19:36.708 --> 19:40.045
<i> That's when two sperm cells
fertilize two seperate eggs. </i>

19:40.253 --> 19:42.255
<i>To each his own embryo </i>

19:42.464 --> 19:44.508
<i>To each his own lucky star</i>

19:44.716 --> 19:47.844
<i> Layton got the height
and I got the neurons. </i>

19:56.592 --> 19:58.144
Mom!
Yeah!

19:59.940 --> 20:01.191
Have you ever gotten AIDS?

20:02.761 --> 20:04.261
What?!

20:05.070 --> 20:08.198
Angela Ashworth says AIDS are bad
and you probably have them.

20:11.701 --> 20:15.247
Well! next time,
you just tell Angela Ashworth

20:15.455 --> 20:18.333
Just because she feels insecure
about being a little girl

20:18.542 --> 20:22.754
in a society that puts an anointed amount of pressure
on moment to the baptism physical standard

20:22.963 --> 20:24.840
it doesn't mean that she had to take out her

20:25.006 --> 20:27.801
misplaced self loathing
on a nicer boy like you.

20:28.009 --> 20:31.179
You may be an inherent part of the problem,
but, certainly doesn't mean you have AIDS.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.683
I'm not sure I can remember all that.

20:36.226 --> 20:38.270
Well, just tell her ... she's fat.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.006
OK.

20:41.606 --> 20:45.026
<i> But Layton died last year doing an accident
with the gun in the old bar.</i>

20:50.240 --> 20:52.117
<i> I don't know what went wrong.</i>

20:52.325 --> 20:54.744
<i> I was there too.
Measuring gun shots. </i>

20:59.833 --> 21:01.626
<i> No one ever talked about it.</i>

21:03.503 --> 21:04.671
<i> No one.</i>

21:07.674 --> 21:08.508
Not bad.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.052
Except that we have to go over
this a little bit.

21:12.929 --> 21:15.098
Daisy ... B +.

21:15.765 --> 21:16.766
Solid work.

21:17.267 --> 21:20.687
Excellent illustrations
of the lake formation process.

21:23.273 --> 21:24.191
T.S. .. C +.

21:26.234 --> 21:28.904
Report shows
undeniable qualities,

21:29.029 --> 21:31.698
but as usual, is way off subject.

21:32.365 --> 21:35.035
What does the formation of lakes in Montana
have anything to do

21:35.243 --> 21:38.663
with the east-west migratory pattern
of Canadian Geese.

21:40.874 --> 21:42.834
Sir, I'm not sure
if you read the introduction ...But I

21:43.043 --> 21:44.794
You think you're the smarter than
everyone else, don't you?

21:46.588 --> 21:48.757
As for the diagram,
its very pretty

21:48.924 --> 21:50.634
but scientifically erroneous.

21:51.384 --> 21:52.469
Really, Sir?

21:53.053 --> 21:54.846
Bacause I sent it to the
Discover Magazine

21:55.806 --> 21:58.517
and ... they like it, and they publish it.

22:04.447 --> 22:07.234
Do not play games with me, T.S.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.612
You're out of your league.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.866
And what about the magnetic wheel?

22:15.075 --> 22:16.660
Didn't mention anything
about that.

22:17.035 --> 22:19.830
I dont give a a rat's ass about
the magnetic wheel

22:20.831 --> 22:23.250
Mr. Stenpock,
how can a man like you,

22:23.458 --> 22:26.962
supposed to open our minds
through scientific curiosity,

22:27.170 --> 22:28.964
How can you be so aggresively narrow minded?

22:29.172 --> 22:30.841
Every scientists were like you

22:31.049 --> 22:32.092
The will be no penicillin,

22:32.259 --> 22:33.218
no relativity,

22:33.426 --> 22:34.302
or sewer trains,

22:34.511 --> 22:36.513
Know what it would be,
no chocolates or cookies!

22:39.307 --> 22:42.144
Superiority complex,
this is what you have. T.S.

22:42.850 --> 22:45.814
Your talents in scientific observations
would be put to better use

22:45.981 --> 22:48.150
in picking your socks in the morning.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.585
Lend me a hand for a second?

23:11.506 --> 23:12.507
What's your need?

23:12.716 --> 23:14.509
Settle out the creak.
Its drying among its pockets.

23:14.718 --> 23:17.137
We'll get her spit up all
she has got before sunset.

23:18.150 --> 23:19.150
Com'on.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.945
<i>To know that my father had to resort
to ask me help from me, </i>

23:34.070 --> 23:36.198
<i> his only remaining son</i>

23:36.490 --> 23:38.700
<i> The one who is used to saw in the ranch</i>

23:38.867 --> 23:40.911
<i> filled me with sadness. </i>

23:45.916 --> 23:48.793
<i>Layton should have been here,
not me. </i>

23:50.045 --> 23:54.883
<i> One day, he shot a coyote with his
Winchester from 200 yards. </i>

23:55.175 --> 23:57.093
<i> Father was so impressed.</i>

23:57.260 --> 24:00.305
<i> He took off his hat and slapped
it on my brother's head. </i>

24:01.223 --> 24:02.974
<i> It was a special moment. </i>

24:03.141 --> 24:05.519
<i> I knew it would never happen to me. </i>

24:08.438 --> 24:10.482
She is still runnin a bit last week.

24:10.690 --> 24:12.317
There's no back for got some juice.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.073
Like the... the crickets teasing me.

24:22.828 --> 24:24.663
<i> Couple of months earlier, </i>

24:24.871 --> 24:28.500
<i>I had built a scale model
depicting the hydrology of our valley. </i>

24:29.167 --> 24:33.421
<i>You could see the various water tables,
drainage trenchs, soil compositions</i>

24:33.630 --> 24:35.465
<i> and sweepage capacity.</i>

24:51.857 --> 24:53.567
Dad! You wanna give it a look?

25:04.661 --> 25:06.371
See... If you dig from here to there,

25:06.955 --> 25:08.707
the water will be channeled
to there.

25:09.249 --> 25:11.585
thereby increasing the flow of water,

25:11.793 --> 25:15.964
those thereby stagnating and evaporating.

25:16.173 --> 25:18.467
'Cause the laws of fluid mechanics,

25:18.675 --> 25:19.551
make it unstoppable.

25:19.759 --> 25:21.720
You asked me I was just pissing the can.

25:22.429 --> 25:24.139
Open your eyes, you'll see that.

25:40.864 --> 25:42.741
That ignorant goats.

25:43.325 --> 25:45.410
Don't worry, I've got it.

25:46.036 --> 25:48.205
Right.

25:54.085 --> 25:56.588
So this used to be coyote chow.

26:01.051 --> 26:03.261
It's okay, Stinky, Don't worry.

26:03.470 --> 26:04.930
I am not gonna hurt you.
Don't worry.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.647
<i>Maybe dying on a ranch
from a snakebite,</i>

26:14.564 --> 26:16.316
<i> is more befitting than a
self inflicted</i>

26:16.525 --> 26:18.318
<i> gunshot going to the head </i>

26:18.527 --> 26:20.987
<i> by an old rifle
in a cold barn. </i>

26:25.408 --> 26:27.828
Fixing on kissing that poison rope?

26:33.333 --> 26:35.460
We still got our bussiness day,isn't it?

26:40.173 --> 26:43.718
<i> That was the first time
my father ever patted me on the back, </i>

26:45.053 --> 26:48.598
<i> but I couldn't tell who was to brush me off,
to reprimand me</i>

26:48.807 --> 26:50.559
<i> or a substitute for a hug.</i>

27:00.777 --> 27:03.029
<i> I would go to Washington DC tomorrow. </i>

27:03.238 --> 27:05.448
<i> I was a researcher, scientist, </i>

27:05.657 --> 27:07.534
<i> and they needed me there. </i>

27:07.742 --> 27:09.244
<i> If I stayed here, </i>

27:09.452 --> 27:11.288
<i> I end up turning around in circles, </i>

27:11.496 --> 27:12.873
<i> like these bats. </i>

27:13.790 --> 27:16.376
<i> I only do the echo of myself. </i>

27:34.227 --> 27:35.729
What's for dinner tonight?

27:36.354 --> 27:37.606
Puree Corn.

27:40.066 --> 27:43.320
Hey T.S, can you take up
my dish washing duties tonight?

27:43.528 --> 27:44.988
I will make it upto you, I swear... Its...

27:45.614 --> 27:48.158
Tonight, its Miss USA pagent,
and I really don't wanna miss the opening.

27:48.617 --> 27:50.076
You already owe me 4.

27:51.117 --> 27:52.148
Miss USA!

27:52.680 --> 27:54.372
And these women are picked for thier
talents on what exactly?

27:55.540 --> 27:56.333
Painting?

27:56.567 --> 27:57.209
Yoga?

27:57.792 --> 27:59.211
Karate, perhaps?

27:59.861 --> 28:00.861
No mom.

28:01.171 --> 28:03.757
Miss America
is only the "talent" portion.

28:03.924 --> 28:05.675
Miss USA is the beauty contest.

28:05.884 --> 28:06.551
It's way better.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.179
I still think its a mistake not to
take into consideration

28:09.387 --> 28:11.431
these girls intellectual attitudes.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.309
Mom, it's a beauty contest.

28:14.518 --> 28:15.811
It's Miss USA.

28:16.019 --> 28:17.395
Otherwise, it would be called
Miss High I.Q.

28:17.604 --> 28:18.814
Which no one would watch,

28:19.022 --> 28:20.065
because it would be boring,

28:20.273 --> 28:21.691
like my life!

28:23.360 --> 28:24.736
I'm sorry Gracie, but ...

28:25.612 --> 28:28.198
you know what it,.. if you were
to enter this kind of contest

28:28.406 --> 28:29.491
It would be a mistake not to

28:29.741 --> 28:32.160
showcase your talents as an actress...
and as a singer

28:32.369 --> 28:34.621
you have a pretty voice ...
and you play the hobo.

28:48.135 --> 28:50.303
I have to go to
Kalispell tomorrow

28:50.512 --> 28:52.264
to collect specimens

28:52.722 --> 28:54.057
It'll be a few days.

28:54.724 --> 28:57.936
I prepared all of your meals, so,
all you have to do is reheat them.

28:59.938 --> 29:00.856
Good deal.

29:13.076 --> 29:15.328
I've been thinking about what you told
me the other day.

29:15.537 --> 29:16.997
about what I used to do

29:17.205 --> 29:18.373
that I stopped doing.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.458
And I was wondering ...

29:20.667 --> 29:22.752
will you come with me to Kalispell?

29:23.295 --> 29:24.671
I would be great to have your help.

29:25.672 --> 29:27.632
Mom, it's entertainment.

29:28.008 --> 29:30.177
Entertainment!

29:37.893 --> 29:39.144
You thought about
what I asked you?

29:41.313 --> 29:43.940
Sorry, I cant come with you
to Kalispell tomorrow.

29:47.068 --> 29:50.238
I have to finish a project for Mr. Stenpock.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.495
Next time,
I'll try and give you a notice.

30:31.822 --> 30:35.492
You reached the Office of Ms. Jibsen,
please leave a message.

30:36.117 --> 30:37.494
By Jack Campbell speaking

30:37.702 --> 30:40.205
The President of the University of Montana.

30:40.455 --> 30:41.706
I have some good news.

30:41.915 --> 30:44.626
Mr.T.S. Spivet has managed to
rearrange his schedule.

30:44.835 --> 30:47.921
So, He will be leaving...first thing tomorrow.
He will not be reachable,

30:48.129 --> 30:50.132
but will make just in time to
accept the baird award

30:50.340 --> 30:51.341
and make his speech or not.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.635
Good night. I mean good morning...

30:54.594 --> 30:57.514
Hey...I do not if
you're aware anything, but ...

30:58.098 --> 30:59.933
you are talking
to a garbage can.

31:05.647 --> 31:07.399
<i> The four steps of packing</i>

31:07.983 --> 31:10.944
<i> I was terrified at the thought of
having to pack my suitcase.</i>

31:11.153 --> 31:12.404
<i> Even packing for school everyday, </i>

31:12.612 --> 31:14.739
<i> took me at the very least 23 min. </i>

31:14.990 --> 31:16.950
Maybe 22 min.

31:17.159 --> 31:20.245
<i> 1 - Play and replay the scenario
of the trip in my head.</i>

31:23.456 --> 31:26.168
2 - To arrange all necessary

<i> Eight pair of underwear. </i>

<i> One thermometer,
One hygrometer, One barometer. </i>

<i> Only one telescope. </i>

<i> One frontal headlamp

pecking beak at the tree. </i>

32:07.626 --> 32:09.294

32:16.218 --> 32:19.012
<i> my suitcase was finally ready. </i>

32:55.132 --> 32:56.341
Goodbye, Layton.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.970
I'll be away for a while to Washington D.C.

33:02.556 --> 33:04.391
I'll bring you back a souvenir.

33:09.146 --> 33:11.064
I'm sorry for what I did.

33:25.662 --> 33:29.332
<i>Dear Spivet Family ,
I'm gone for a while to do some work. </i>

33:29.541 --> 33:31.459
<i> Dont worry, I'll be fine. </i>

33:31.668 --> 33:35.255
<i> I do not want to bother you
by telling you about it ahead of time.</i>

33:35.463 --> 33:39.509
<i> Thank you for taking care of me.
You're one of the best families in the world. </i>

33:39.968 --> 33:41.344
<i>Love, T.S. </i>

34:09.289 --> 34:10.290
Hello, Tapioca.

34:10.498 --> 34:11.248
Hello.

34:12.501 --> 34:13.627
I'll miss you.

34:13.835 --> 34:14.960
Where are you going?

34:15.629 --> 34:17.589
To the Smithsonian in Washington D.C.

34:19.716 --> 34:21.510
It seems like everyone ends up

34:21.717 --> 34:23.637
leaving in this house.

34:25.472 --> 34:26.723
I'll be back.

35:18.275 --> 35:20.318
<i> Why had he not stopped? </i>

35:21.194 --> 35:24.322
<i> Because I was responsible for
his favorite son's death</i>

35:24.531 --> 35:26.908
<i> and I must be banished from the ranch. </i>

35:27.117 --> 35:28.076
<i>Thats why.</i>

38:49.277 --> 38:52.572
<i> The crossing </i>

39:22.310 --> 39:24.437

39:24.646 --> 39:26.815
neon, nitrogen, silicon, magnesium

39:27.023 --> 39:28.150
and sulfur.

39:30.986 --> 39:32.571
"How beautiful the sun

39:32.779 --> 39:34.156
"when newly risen,

39:34.364 --> 39:36.700
"And explodes in the morning greetings

39:36.908 --> 39:40.579
"Happy as the man who can
lovingly salute its rising

39:40.787 --> 39:43.123
"more glorious than a dream!"

40:24.414 --> 40:26.416
You're officially a hobo now?

40:26.750 --> 40:28.210
Well, incase you haven't noticed,

40:28.585 --> 40:32.672
I'm heading a freight train right,
on my way to Washington D.C.

40:32.881 --> 40:35.550
And..What's an adventurer
never leave aside?

40:36.259 --> 40:38.970
His knife, his magnifying glass,

40:39.179 --> 40:41.139
his maps, his whip

40:42.057 --> 40:43.266
and his hat.

40:44.684 --> 40:46.603
But, You have forgotten the whip.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.732
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too. I'm glad you're here.

41:09.125 --> 41:11.711
No! Not my Japanese weevils !

41:15.966 --> 41:19.719
These larvae.. stay survived..
shipment across the Pacific ocean,

41:19.928 --> 41:22.639
70 000 miles, to end up in the
stomach of a goat?

41:22.848 --> 41:25.684
It's just the ignorant Montana goats.
They dont know any better.

41:26.309 --> 41:29.312
Oh..well..If you can't manage your karate goats,
maybe you should consider another line of work!

41:29.521 --> 41:32.858
If that's what you think,
you know, set the plate at the table for me.

41:33.817 --> 41:37.529
If that's what you think,
you know, set my plate at the table.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.225
<i> Security, track number 8. </i>

45:27.759 --> 45:31.388
<i> A melancholy feeling came over me,
I cannot get rid of. </i>

45:33.515 --> 45:35.684
<i> The motorhome was pointed backwards, </i>

45:35.892 --> 45:39.020
<i> So, I had that depressing feeling
that I was traveling in reverse.</i>

47:16.660 --> 47:17.661
Hello, kid.

47:18.578 --> 47:20.664
Hey... Kid!

47:23.500 --> 47:24.417
Come over.

47:25.544 --> 47:26.878
Com'on, Come over.

47:32.300 --> 47:34.261
Com'on, Get closer.

47:36.263 --> 47:37.264
Hold It.

47:41.226 --> 47:42.727
This is your first time?
Yes.

47:44.521 --> 47:45.605
"Two Clouds".

47:46.481 --> 47:48.233
"Two Clouds", that's my name.

47:48.441 --> 47:49.484
I am T.S.

47:49.693 --> 47:52.487
T for Tecumseh
S for Sparrow

47:53.280 --> 47:55.615
Sparrow, as in the bird?

47:55.679 --> 47:57.236
Yes.

47:57.242 --> 48:00.912
At the moment on my birth,
a sparrow crashed through the window

48:01.121 --> 48:03.582
and died right down
kitchen floor.

48:04.374 --> 48:05.333
Follow me.

48:15.677 --> 48:16.761
Step on it.

48:17.679 --> 48:18.513
Com'on!

48:37.199 --> 48:40.994
You know why the right sole
is more worn out than the left one?

48:42.120 --> 48:44.539
Because one of your legs is
shorter than the other?

48:44.873 --> 48:48.835
Nope. Because these shoes belong
to Johnny Cash

48:49.044 --> 48:50.670
He always kept the beat.

48:54.174 --> 48:57.552
You think the dead sparrow in your kitchen
right when you were born

48:57.761 --> 48:59.971
is a more credible story?

49:01.389 --> 49:02.891
That's what mom told me.

49:04.100 --> 49:06.895
Your mother gave birth in the kitchen?

49:11.566 --> 49:12.609
You see?

49:12.943 --> 49:13.902
What?

49:14.569 --> 49:15.737
The Sparrow.

49:16.780 --> 49:17.906
Once Upon a time

49:18.198 --> 49:20.408
there was a sparrow that was very ill

49:20.617 --> 49:22.661
didn't have the strength to go south.

49:22.869 --> 49:24.830
Go without me, he told his children.

49:25.497 --> 49:27.499
I'll find shelter from the cold

49:27.707 --> 49:29.876
and I'll see you in spring.

49:34.548 --> 49:35.507
So, did he survive?

49:36.383 --> 49:38.802
The bird went to an oak tree

49:39.010 --> 49:42.013
and asked if he could take shelter
in his leaves.

49:42.222 --> 49:46.685
But the oak was,
the cold and arrogant tree,.. he refused.

49:47.310 --> 49:49.146
The peach,.. the aspen,

49:49.312 --> 49:50.522
the willow, the elm,

49:50.689 --> 49:53.233
they all said no, can you believe this?

49:53.525 --> 49:54.442
I guess.

49:55.402 --> 49:57.904
Don't answer the question...
It's part of the story...

49:58.655 --> 49:59.781
Sorry!..

50:00.532 --> 50:03.535
Then the first snows came.

50:03.794 --> 50:07.247
The sparrow took a last chance
with the pine tree, who said:

50:07.414 --> 50:09.416
I can't offer you much protection,

50:09.693 --> 50:11.877
I only have needles that let in draft

50:12.794 --> 50:15.213
But my answer is ...

50:16.423 --> 50:17.424
Yes.

50:18.550 --> 50:21.595
Overjoyed, the sparrow took refuge there

50:21.970 --> 50:23.346
and you know what?

50:26.808 --> 50:28.477
He survived the winter.

50:28.935 --> 50:31.938
The children returned and
wept tears of joy.

50:32.147 --> 50:36.860
Upon seeing this, the Creator decided to
punish all the other trees for their selfishness.

50:37.068 --> 50:38.153
From that day on,

50:38.904 --> 50:41.948
every tree lost
it's leaves in winter,

50:42.157 --> 50:45.535
except the pine,
who saved the sparrow.

50:48.205 --> 50:51.041
My grandmother
told me this story.

50:53.335 --> 50:55.253
Had you ever heard it before?

50:58.924 --> 51:00.884
You can answer now.

51:01.092 --> 51:02.427
Story is finished!

51:05.305 --> 51:06.890
The story is very pretty.

51:08.475 --> 51:11.728
But, the insulating properties of
pine needles

51:12.062 --> 51:14.564
could not release the heat to create
a warm enough cocoon

51:14.773 --> 51:17.067
for a bird the size of a sparrow.

51:17.484 --> 51:19.444
Your grandmother lied to you.

51:24.845 --> 51:27.244
So where were you headed, T.S.?

51:27.702 --> 51:29.955
To buy me a hot dog.

51:30.163 --> 51:32.499
The old sea dog!

51:35.418 --> 51:37.128
Captain's Choice!..
Huh!..

51:39.256 --> 51:41.842
Quickly, it close in fifteen minutes.

51:43.635 --> 51:45.011
Bye, Sparrow!..

51:45.220 --> 51:46.805
See you, Bye!

51:47.097 --> 51:49.307
I'm sure you will find your tree.

51:49.516 --> 51:50.725
You too!

51:51.768 --> 51:52.853
<i> Dr. Clair ... </i>

51:53.270 --> 51:55.772
<i> this time, you can't stop me. </i>

52:07.909 --> 52:10.495
And what is the reason behind this embargo?

52:12.038 --> 52:15.375
T.S., Do you know where this smell
of those marvellous sausages comes from?

52:15.584 --> 52:18.295
It's from a smell factory,
on the New Jersey Turnpike.

52:18.503 --> 52:20.881
It was carefully designed and
artificially synthesized

52:21.089 --> 52:23.633
to maximize their desirability.

52:23.842 --> 52:24.843
Do you like it one?

52:25.635 --> 52:27.012
A drink with that?

52:27.429 --> 52:28.388
Sure, Is that included?

52:28.555 --> 52:29.598
Yeah, sure.

52:29.973 --> 52:31.516
I'm gonna give you straw.

52:31.766 --> 52:34.686
and one of my best hot dogs,
I hope you like it.

52:36.146 --> 52:37.189
Hi Marj.

52:38.064 --> 52:39.065
I want you to look at this.

52:39.274 --> 52:40.692
Some kid out of Montana

52:40.901 --> 52:43.361
ran away or got himself kidnapped
or something.

52:43.570 --> 52:44.738
Can I know where to put that?

52:44.946 --> 52:47.115
- Hmm.. just put up on the board.
- Thanks

52:57.042 --> 52:59.127
I know someone
who ain't gonna be happy with you...

53:00.879 --> 53:01.880
your mom!.

53:03.423 --> 53:04.716
Just kiddin', young man.

53:05.175 --> 53:08.595
But if you eat a hot dog before your dinner,
you ain't gonna hungry for the soup she made ya.

53:09.346 --> 53:11.932
I don't hav a mother around.
My parents are dead.

53:14.810 --> 53:16.269
You take care little guy.

53:16.478 --> 53:17.562
You see what happens

53:17.771 --> 53:19.606
to kids that go astray?

53:44.965 --> 53:45.924
My son!

53:46.133 --> 53:47.634
You have been kidnapped?

53:48.009 --> 53:50.512
Oh! Thank God! What a relief.

53:50.720 --> 53:53.098
Baby, baby, you know,
you're right,

53:53.306 --> 53:55.559
I've been wasting my time
certain cicindele...

53:55.767 --> 53:58.520
Son, we still got a
situation with the creek.

53:58.728 --> 54:00.397
You're spot on with that covert.

54:00.605 --> 54:03.316
What you say come right back,
and, and we work on your plans together.

54:03.525 --> 54:06.945
T.S., you have to come home
'cause you said you'll make my Halloween costume.

54:07.154 --> 54:07.887
Com'on baby!.

54:51.406 --> 54:53.575
<i> May be somewhere

54:53.783 --> 54:56.870
<i> a boy just woke up
from the sound of my train. </i>

54:57.913 --> 54:58.914
<i>Maybe he is wondering</i>

54:59.122 --> 55:01.917
<i> what it would be like to climb aboard
and cross the desert. </i>

55:04.794 --> 55:07.714
<i>God' I just want
to switch places with him </i>

55:07.923 --> 55:11.092
<i> and just watch the train
go awaying to the unknown. </i>

55:13.887 --> 55:15.305
<i> I had to admit it.</i>

55:15.555 --> 55:17.849
<i> I was not a careless drifter, </i>

55:18.683 --> 55:22.437
<i> just a tiny old boy,
who ran away from home. </i>

55:24.147 --> 55:27.317
<i> Any more or less,
Can I assume be peeing on my sofa, </i>

55:27.526 --> 55:29.069

<i> Why? </i>

57:25.435 --> 57:27.771
<i> Is it the T.S. is more like me? </i>

57:28.980 --> 57:30.732
<i> He doesn't like what I am. </i>

57:30.941 --> 57:32.400
<i> He doesn't love me. </i>

57:35.654 --> 57:36.905
Of course he loves you!

57:37.322 --> 57:38.615
You love each other!

57:40.325 --> 57:42.869
If we make a baby,
it means we love each other, right?

57:44.996 --> 57:47.499
And they had three babies.
Ain't that right?

57:58.093 --> 58:01.138
<i>I still catch myself haunting to wake
him up for school. </i>

58:19.322 --> 58:20.532
Sorry!..
Sorry.

58:21.992 --> 58:22.993
Stopped everything?

58:23.577 --> 58:26.371
What do you mean
in a maternal sense or a scientific one?

58:26.580 --> 58:28.707
<i> T.S. came to see me in my study,</i>

58:28.915 --> 58:31.376
<i> for the first time since the accident. </i>

<i> I'm not really there for T.S. anymore...</i>

58:36.756 --> 58:38.884
<i> I'm like an empty house. </i>

59:11.791 --> 59:13.877

59:15.712 --> 59:18.006
<i>Every millimeter of landscape </i>

59:18.131 --> 59:21.051
<i> was replaced by manmade constructions</i>

59:21.259 --> 59:22.719
<i> ruled by the laws of geometry. </i>

59:23.553 --> 59:26.723
<i> How could humans create
so many right angles </i>

59:27.015 --> 59:31.311
<i> when their behavior
is so convoluted and illogical? </i>

59:55.710 --> 59:57.420
See you, old sea dog.

01:00:00.215 --> 01:00:01.925
I'm sure you'll find
your pine tree.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.677
Playing hookey from kindergarten?

01:00:49.222 --> 01:00:50.348
I'm talking to you.

01:00:50.849 --> 01:00:51.641
No, sir.

01:00:51.766 --> 01:00:53.018
What you got in the bag?

01:00:53.393 --> 01:00:56.313
Spray paint? You vandalized in snitch,
you paint that silo?

01:00:57.355 --> 01:00:58.482
I love Chicago.

01:01:00.025 --> 01:01:00.674
What?

01:01:06.573 --> 01:01:09.451
Are you shitting me, snitch? Where you from?

01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:11.536
Chernobyl.

01:01:12.815 --> 01:01:14.223
Oh, Yeah!.. Well,

01:01:15.582 --> 01:01:17.000
You little shit!

01:01:19.169 --> 01:01:20.837
Welcome to the
great state of Illinois.

01:01:21.046 --> 01:01:23.465

01:01:29.763 --> 01:01:30.430
What?

01:01:30.722 --> 01:01:32.265
Property, You said priority.

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.018
Get in the car!

01:01:40.524 --> 01:01:41.233
Gotch'ya!

Look, it's moving!

01:02:20.105 --> 01:02:22.649
Ok, Snitch,..
End of the line.

01:02:23.024 --> 01:02:24.901
Thanks for the exercise, but ...

01:02:25.193 --> 01:02:26.194
lets go.

01:02:27.404 --> 01:02:30.031
What? What you gonna do?
You gonna Jump?

01:02:31.158 --> 01:02:32.617
Com'on. Don't make me walk over there.

01:02:35.954 --> 01:02:37.831
Hang on, Hang on, kiddie! Allright!
Hang on,..

01:02:41.209 --> 01:02:42.377
Don't look down...
Don't look down.

01:02:43.545 --> 01:02:44.421
Get your foot up.
com'on.

01:02:44.588 --> 01:02:46.423
Come on, You can do it,
come on!

01:02:47.061 --> 01:02:49.755
Get your foot up.
You can do it. You can do all up that,..God!..

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:51.826
God!..Oh!
oh!..

01:03:00.145 --> 01:03:01.480
Oh! you little shit.

01:03:02.022 --> 01:03:03.106
You're very good!

01:03:03.315 --> 01:03:05.108
Hey!..You think you got away?..huh!

01:03:05.275 --> 01:03:07.068
Well done! Hey, over here!

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.989
You think you got away with this.. huh?

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:12.327
Is that what you thinking?
huh..

01:03:12.699 --> 01:03:14.284
No way, kid!

01:03:14.378 --> 01:03:16.495
listen to.., Snitch, look at me!

01:03:18.997 --> 01:03:22.334
Look me in the eye..What's the matter?
You don't wanna look in the eye?

01:03:22.542 --> 01:03:24.294
Right here! I'm gonna find you!

01:04:33.321 --> 01:04:35.740
How're doin', man?
You don't look so hot.

01:04:35.907 --> 01:04:36.556
I'm ok.

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:38.743
I just fell down and hurt myself.

01:04:38.952 --> 01:04:41.079
Where you're heading for, like this, man?

01:04:42.164 --> 01:04:43.874
To the Smithsonian.

01:04:45.292 --> 01:04:45.941
Where?

01:04:47.085 --> 01:04:49.004
D.C. is in Washington, man.

01:05:06.563 --> 01:05:07.856
My name is Ricky.

01:05:09.149 --> 01:05:10.066
T.S.

01:05:10.275 --> 01:05:11.902
Put your seatbelt on, T.S.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:23.288
Show me.

01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:28.335
That's a real deal!

01:05:28.668 --> 01:05:30.170
Hurt when you breathe?

01:05:30.837 --> 01:05:34.549
You got maybe one, two broken ribs.
You seriously need to see a medic.

01:05:35.884 --> 01:05:37.636
No, I'll be okay.

01:05:39.304 --> 01:05:40.806
Tough little bugger, ain't you.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.820
Always take two pictures of hitchhikers.

01:05:55.028 --> 01:05:56.404
One when I pick'em up,

01:05:56.613 --> 01:05:58.323
one when I drop'em off.

01:06:07.123 --> 01:06:08.208
Even in the service,

01:06:08.375 --> 01:06:09.709
I was taking pictures.

01:06:10.377 --> 01:06:11.628
That guy,

01:06:11.795 --> 01:06:13.630
was a hitchhiker too?

01:06:14.714 --> 01:06:15.715
Well... Not exactly.

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:18.385
What do you think?

01:06:18.802 --> 01:06:22.305
Join the army, see the world,
arresting people ...

01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:23.705
and kill'em.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.304
The East.

01:07:08.185 --> 01:07:09.436
Where are we?

01:07:10.103 --> 01:07:11.438
Not far from where you are headed.

01:07:23.992 --> 01:07:26.828
Not sure what you are looking for,
but don't change a thing.

01:07:27.037 --> 01:07:28.497
Steady in your boots.

01:07:28.747 --> 01:07:29.771
Good luck, man.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.919
I'm not sure what you are looking for either,
but you will sure find your pine tree, man.

01:08:08.328 --> 01:08:10.997
Young man?.. Are you alright?
Are you injured?

01:08:11.289 --> 01:08:13.375
Cathy, I need information.

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:16.169
You look like you need medical assistance.

01:08:16.377 --> 01:08:18.380
I would like to speak with
Mrs. G. H. Jibsen, please.

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:21.550
I'm here to give a speech tomorrow night.

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:24.886
What's your name?

01:08:24.886 --> 01:08:27.430
T.S.Spivet.

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:35.354
Just a moment.

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:38.567
You're T.S. Spivet,

01:08:38.774 --> 01:08:41.111
or your father is  T.S. Spivet?

01:08:42.112 --> 01:08:44.352
I am  T.S. Spivet.

01:08:49.452 --> 01:08:52.747
He claims to be,
he actually is T.S. Spivet.

01:08:52.956 --> 01:08:55.041
He is 9 or 10 years older

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:56.917
and very, very, very ...

01:08:57.042 --> 01:08:57.961
small.

01:08:58.795 --> 01:09:01.298
Alright, that would be wonderful,
thank you.

01:09:01.923 --> 01:09:04.134
Miss Jibsen is on her way down.

01:09:04.593 --> 01:09:06.761
You can have a seat over there.

01:09:19.274 --> 01:09:20.149
You're here?

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:24.779
Never too far away you know.

01:09:25.363 --> 01:09:27.115
Yeah, I know.

01:09:28.283 --> 01:09:31.703
See!...
Made it to the Smithsonian.

01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:38.001
The worst is yet to come.

01:09:40.002 --> 01:09:41.254
Can help you, young man?

01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:45.216
Ms. Jibsen?

01:09:45.634 --> 01:09:46.801
Hello.

01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:50.263
I am T.S. Spivet. I made it here.

01:09:52.808 --> 01:09:56.144
You're the one I talked to in
the phone, last friday?

01:09:56.566 --> 01:09:57.566
Yes.

01:09:58.897 --> 01:10:00.315
So, where is your father?

01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:02.818
In fact, he is dead.

01:10:03.026 --> 01:10:04.653
I lied to you then.

01:10:07.697 --> 01:10:10.492
So, who sent me
the prototype of the magnet wheel?

01:10:11.159 --> 01:10:12.160
I did.

01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:17.457
What, you expect me to
belive that you invented it?

01:10:18.625 --> 01:10:19.918
Not really.

01:10:20.502 --> 01:10:21.920
I don't invent anything.

01:10:25.048 --> 01:10:26.925
I just transposed the principle of

01:10:27.092 --> 01:10:30.679
an electron gravitating
around the nucleus.

01:10:30.887 --> 01:10:33.598
But as you know, to simulate its
perpetual motion

01:10:33.765 --> 01:10:35.433
would require the creation

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.102
of a negative entropy,

01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:39.271
which is simply not possible.

01:10:39.479 --> 01:10:41.064
You must agree.. right?

01:10:44.401 --> 01:10:45.360
This can't..

01:10:46.903 --> 01:10:49.447
This can't be..
How old are you?

01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:51.449
10.

01:10:57.706 --> 01:11:00.584
We're not gonna be ought to turn him into
great communicator,

01:11:00.792 --> 01:11:04.588
but with the right clothes and
some solid talking points, no problem.

01:11:05.881 --> 01:11:08.842
Oh, yes.. In his eyes,
I am the Scientific Authority of

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:10.635
everything he admires.

01:11:11.845 --> 01:11:13.388
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

01:11:17.417 --> 01:11:19.705
So, You need to keep him?

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.168
Nope.

01:11:21.396 --> 01:11:24.691
But with multiple fractures,
he needs to rest.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.776
Any abrupt movement

01:11:26.985 --> 01:11:29.571
and not cough or laugh.

01:11:30.238 --> 01:11:31.323
Good luck.

01:11:32.949 --> 01:11:34.034
How do you feel?

01:11:34.242 --> 01:11:36.328
Like that mule done kick me good.

01:11:36.536 --> 01:11:38.622
Its my dad's expression.

01:11:39.122 --> 01:11:41.875
You have seen as miss
your parents very much.

01:11:49.716 --> 01:11:51.176
I'm so sorry!

01:11:54.471 --> 01:11:58.225
So, I talked to some colleagues
at the Smithsonian.

01:11:58.433 --> 01:12:00.519
And, everybody is ecstatic
that you've

01:12:00.727 --> 01:12:02.270
chosen for this award.

01:12:03.063 --> 01:12:05.857
You have to give me their names.
I'll thank them in my speech.

01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:08.026
On that topic..

01:12:09.361 --> 01:12:11.696
I think we can quote
something up for you.

01:12:13.406 --> 01:12:16.243
I prefer to write my own speech.
Thank you.

01:12:21.498 --> 01:12:23.667
You certainly don't waste any
time about it, do you?

01:12:25.024 --> 01:12:26.378
No, this is a purple note book.

01:12:26.586 --> 01:12:29.089
If i'll be writing my speech,
it would be in the red one.

01:12:29.673 --> 01:12:32.008
Yes, of course.
And the purple one is for ...?

01:12:32.217 --> 01:12:33.635
"General Considerations."

01:12:33.844 --> 01:12:34.970
Such as?

01:12:35.428 --> 01:12:37.264
When did the child become an adult?

01:12:38.306 --> 01:12:39.266
And?

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.768
When you don't get excited about Christmas,

01:12:41.977 --> 01:12:45.188
When you wear reading glass right a minute
but can't see to find them anywhere

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.941
When you pay income tax and
enjoy getting angry discussing,

01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:50.277
"What the heck are they going to do
with all your money?"

01:12:52.112 --> 01:12:56.032
And when you look down on children
whatever is going on in their little heads.

01:12:57.367 --> 01:13:00.495
<i>If  2x goes into 100
and x is an integer, How many of the</i>

01:13:00.496 --> 01:13:04.104
<i>2x + 2 integers will be divisible by 3n/2</i>

01:13:05.389 --> 01:13:08.257
<i>(2x-1)=(3x+1), what is x?</i>

01:13:09.206 --> 01:13:12.637
<i>how many possible integers less than 5000
are even integers...</i>

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:13.638
<i> out of 15 or 21.</i>

01:13:17.179 --> 01:13:18.805
I am like a dolphin.

01:13:18.972 --> 01:13:21.892
Turning one side of a brain off
and other one on.

01:13:22.601 --> 01:13:24.311
So, That's what dolpins do?

01:13:24.478 --> 01:13:26.146
Yeah, to sleep.

01:13:28.565 --> 01:13:29.816
You're funny.

01:13:29.941 --> 01:13:30.942
Why?

01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:34.362
You travelled by yourself
half across United States

01:13:34.529 --> 01:13:36.281
to end up like a lab rat?

01:13:44.456 --> 01:13:46.708
This defies all understanding.

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:48.710
Superior mental activity?

01:13:49.586 --> 01:13:52.339
Superior to an average of an
ocean mammal that is.

01:13:52.589 --> 01:13:55.842
You could train him like a
highly intelligent seal.

01:13:56.837 --> 01:13:57.677
I'm sorry,

01:13:57.803 --> 01:14:01.014
but you don't invent the
perpetual movement machine

01:14:01.181 --> 01:14:03.225
by balancing a ball on your nose!

01:14:05.894 --> 01:14:08.522
Thank you for evaluating my brain, Jodie.

01:14:45.517 --> 01:14:46.351
Will you like some

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.145
tuna tartare and grilled asparagus
sprinkled with

01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:49.855
balsamic vinegar reduction?

01:14:52.274 --> 01:14:55.610
Sir, Why you hiding your
white glove behind your back?

01:14:57.612 --> 01:14:59.823
That's just how they told me to stand.

01:15:00.031 --> 01:15:01.449
Otherwise, I'll get fired.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.453
Well, I like your white gloves.
Congratulations.

01:15:07.194 --> 01:15:07.954
Thanks.

01:15:11.126 --> 01:15:12.669
I almost forgot this.

01:15:12.919 --> 01:15:16.381
In case someone mistakes you for a kid
whose parents couldn't round up.

01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:17.549
A babysitter.

01:15:23.722 --> 01:15:24.806
Sorry.

01:15:26.433 --> 01:15:28.768
I want to be the first to congratulate you.

01:15:28.935 --> 01:15:31.869
We are so lucky to have
a boy like you!...so lucky!

01:15:32.036 --> 01:15:33.158
What was your first invention?

01:15:33.325 --> 01:15:34.566
Do you think your parents
will be proud of you?

01:15:34.733 --> 01:15:36.151
What is your astrological sign?

01:15:42.365 --> 01:15:43.909
So, Any other questions?

01:15:44.117 --> 01:15:46.578
Did you ever think that you would find
another suitable candidate?

01:15:47.162 --> 01:15:48.205
I remember,

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:50.040
Sitting in my office,

01:15:50.248 --> 01:15:52.042
before I called him on the ranch,

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:53.627
and I said to myself,

01:15:54.461 --> 01:15:55.754
he is only 10,

01:15:56.373 --> 01:15:57.297
but let's do this!

01:16:01.468 --> 01:16:04.012
They're eating you up,
they'll love you.

01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:09.851
<i> In 1862 a Frenchman
named Guillaume Duchenne </i>

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:13.772
<i> discovered the difference
between fake and genuine smiles. </i>

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:17.192
<i> In a fake smile, it's
not just the zygomatic muscles work, </i>

01:16:17.859 --> 01:16:21.613
<i> the muscles around the eyes
also contract unconsciously. </i>

01:16:21.822 --> 01:16:25.325
<i> Tonight
it was entirely ocular-zygomaticus. </i>

01:16:30.163 --> 01:16:31.832
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:31.957 --> 01:16:34.751
please welcome
President of the Smithsonian,

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.003
Dr. Leonard Sullivan.

01:16:44.261 --> 01:16:46.555
Thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen

01:16:46.763 --> 01:16:48.431
and thank you to
our guest of honor.

01:16:50.058 --> 01:16:50.934
At a time

01:16:51.143 --> 01:16:53.103
when science is being challenged in every turn

01:16:53.311 --> 01:16:56.565
when we are witnessing
a return to intellectual obscurity,

01:16:56.773 --> 01:16:57.774
I can not resist

01:16:57.983 --> 01:17:00.944
the temptation to quote Albert Einstein.

01:17:01.153 --> 01:17:02.279
He said ...

01:17:02.612 --> 01:17:04.823
"Only two things are infinite:"

01:17:05.031 --> 01:17:07.659
"the universe and human stupidity ..."

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.745
and, I'm not sure about the former

01:17:11.204 --> 01:17:14.291
But I know a third example:

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.293
human genius.

01:17:17.544 --> 01:17:20.547
Our guest of honor tonight
is a magnificient example of this.

01:17:20.797 --> 01:17:22.632
I invite you to show him

01:17:22.841 --> 01:17:24.426
all the respect he deserves,

01:17:24.634 --> 01:17:26.094
despite his young years.

01:17:26.553 --> 01:17:29.639
Ladies and gentlemen, T.S. Spivet.

01:18:20.315 --> 01:18:21.650
Hello everybody.

01:18:24.778 --> 01:18:26.696
My name is T.S. Spivet,

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.115
I am 10 years old

01:18:29.825 --> 01:18:31.785
and I am actually in sixth grade.

01:18:33.995 --> 01:18:35.622
Is there anyone in this room,

01:18:35.914 --> 01:18:38.834
who doesn't already
atleast have a PhD?

01:18:40.877 --> 01:18:42.045
Any one?

01:18:44.923 --> 01:18:47.717
So, I probably won't
be teaching you much tonight.

01:18:48.218 --> 01:18:50.387
But I like to tell you three things.

01:18:50.804 --> 01:18:52.055
First,

01:18:53.306 --> 01:18:54.432
thank you ...

01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:58.294
Thank you for not cancelling my award
'cause I was younger than you expected.

01:18:59.896 --> 01:19:01.857
Second , the wheel.

01:19:02.315 --> 01:19:04.818
As you can see they are powered by magnets.

01:19:05.026 --> 01:19:05.944
Yet as you know,

01:19:06.153 --> 01:19:09.281
they demagnetize
within approximately 400 years.

01:19:09.489 --> 01:19:11.783
On a human scale,
it sounds like a lot.

01:19:11.992 --> 01:19:15.328
In geological time, it's
not even a fraction of a second.

01:19:15.537 --> 01:19:19.374
So, we're actually far from
having a perpetual motion.

01:19:29.426 --> 01:19:30.719
Any Questions?

01:19:32.554 --> 01:19:34.681
Yes, what is the third point?

01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:39.352
Oh yes, the third ...

01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:50.405
My brother died this year.

01:19:56.244 --> 01:19:58.663
He shot himself in the barn.

01:19:59.498 --> 01:20:01.041
No one talks about it.

01:20:01.333 --> 01:20:04.753
No one ever said
"Layton shot himself in the barn."

01:20:06.254 --> 01:20:07.255
No one.

01:20:09.508 --> 01:20:13.011
Layton and Me
we were always very different.

01:20:14.054 --> 01:20:16.264
I have been doing my
scientific experiments,

01:20:16.765 --> 01:20:20.852
and, he would be shooting empty bean cans
and coyotes with his Winchester.

01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:25.982
So, I came up with this idea to make
sound waves match the gunshots.

01:20:26.191 --> 01:20:27.859
That way we could play something together.

01:20:28.944 --> 01:20:31.530
He would shoot, and I gathered data.

01:20:33.615 --> 01:20:34.574
And

01:20:35.659 --> 01:20:38.119
one of his Winchester has jammed.

01:20:40.455 --> 01:20:43.083
I held the bottom of the rifle to help out.

01:20:44.751 --> 01:20:47.045
I didn't even touched the trigger.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.715
There was an explosion.

01:20:56.763 --> 01:20:59.474
Layton flew across the room.

01:21:00.225 --> 01:21:01.268
Blood...

01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:04.020
dripped off the hay.

01:21:08.066 --> 01:21:09.151
He was there,

01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:13.071
but he wasn't my brother anymore.

01:21:17.617 --> 01:21:19.161
I was alone.

01:21:23.206 --> 01:21:25.917
I ran to the field to get my father.

01:21:26.710 --> 01:21:30.881
His face clenched up when I said
Layton had hurt himself badly.

01:21:31.339 --> 01:21:33.341
He ran back, and I stayed there,

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:35.302
not knowing where to go.

01:21:37.137 --> 01:21:40.599
Then I ran to the house and hid
in the bathroom.

01:21:42.559 --> 01:21:45.437
I could hear my father
whispering on the phone.

01:21:47.355 --> 01:21:51.776
And through the window, I saw the ambulance
pull without the flashing lights.

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:57.449
After a while, Gracie showed up.

01:21:57.657 --> 01:21:58.867
She was crying.

01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:02.662
She sat next to me in the floor

01:22:04.206 --> 01:22:06.791
We stayed a long time like that.

01:22:07.584 --> 01:22:09.794
Lying on the floor without talking.

01:22:17.594 --> 01:22:20.305
I wanted you to know how proud
I am to get this award.

01:22:20.639 --> 01:22:22.933
I'll do my best to fulfill your trust in me,

01:22:23.141 --> 01:22:24.684
and to be in the service of science.

01:22:25.352 --> 01:22:27.771
That's all I had to say. Thank you.

01:23:27.622 --> 01:23:30.250
<i> The amazing thing about water drops,</i>

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:34.254
<i> is that they always take
the path of least resistance. </i>

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.964
<i> For humans, </i>

01:23:36.131 --> 01:23:38.467
<i> it's exactly the opposite. </i>

01:23:41.761 --> 01:23:43.013
<i> When Layton died, </i>

01:23:43.221 --> 01:23:47.559
<i> Tapioca started chewing metal buckets
till it's gums bled. </i>

01:23:49.394 --> 01:23:52.147
<i> Layton and Tapioca had been inseparable. </i>

01:23:53.899 --> 01:23:55.025
<i> And then one day, </i>

01:23:55.233 --> 01:23:57.861
<i> Gracie took him
for a long walk through the meadow. </i>

01:23:59.905 --> 01:24:02.782
<i> They sat for a while
facing the mountains. </i>

01:24:06.578 --> 01:24:09.789
<i> Gracie returned with a new kind of
understanding in their eyes. </i>

01:24:09.998 --> 01:24:12.167
<i> Tapioca stopped chewing metal buckets. </i>

01:24:13.168 --> 01:24:16.546
<i> He went back to snapping at fireflies,
just like before.</i>

01:24:17.047 --> 01:24:19.674
<i>As if he had made peace with
lossing his master.</i>

01:24:21.718 --> 01:24:26.056
<i> Maybe someday,
I'll go back snapping at fireflies too.</i>

01:24:27.265 --> 01:24:28.934
I swear to you.

01:24:29.434 --> 01:24:32.687
They loved...They loved the kid!
I mean,

01:24:33.146 --> 01:24:35.148
Granted they are just a bunch of scientists,

01:24:35.357 --> 01:24:38.944
but if their reaction is anything like the way
the general public is gonna respond,

01:24:39.152 --> 01:24:41.822
we've got a gold mine
on our hands here!

01:24:43.406 --> 01:24:45.659
People are so predictable

01:24:46.409 --> 01:24:47.369
it's nuts, really.

01:24:47.619 --> 01:24:50.789
I should write a handbook on
how to move the masses.

01:24:50.997 --> 01:24:51.832
Hang on!

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.458
Honey! Smile!

01:24:56.294 --> 01:24:59.047
No, I think it would be better if you're
sketching in your notebook.

01:24:59.464 --> 01:25:00.632
But, I didn't bring one.

01:25:00.841 --> 01:25:02.759
Sally, can we have a notebook here, Quick.

01:25:03.593 --> 01:25:05.971
Hang on a minute,
problem with the kid.

01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.673
There you go.

01:25:09.516 --> 01:25:12.727
But, It's not the right colour.
I'd never sketch on a green notebook.

01:25:13.061 --> 01:25:15.730
This is just a photograph,
nobody cares.

01:25:16.773 --> 01:25:18.316
OK, so, where were we?
Oh Yeah.

01:25:19.854 --> 01:25:20.618
Its amazing!

01:25:20.619 --> 01:25:21.619
Wow. Thank you.

01:25:25.866 --> 01:25:28.076
Now, I don't want to get your
hopes up, but ...

01:25:28.285 --> 01:25:29.536
Listen to this:

01:25:30.203 --> 01:25:32.956
The White House is sniffing around!

01:25:33.999 --> 01:25:35.417
The White House?

01:25:37.335 --> 01:25:40.005
The President stated the
union addresses next week, and they,

01:25:40.213 --> 01:25:43.592
and they love having talking points in the audience.

01:25:43.967 --> 01:25:45.135
I can hear 'em now,

01:25:45.343 --> 01:25:48.513
"Look, the
American educational system is working."

01:25:51.558 --> 01:25:52.893
What we really need

01:25:53.101 --> 01:25:55.103
are pictures of your parents.

01:25:55.479 --> 01:25:57.147
Especially your brother.

01:25:57.355 --> 01:26:00.817
Preferably holding a gun,
with you in the background, that would be perfect.

01:26:01.151 --> 01:26:02.777
Tomorrow, we go to New York , do Letterman

01:26:02.986 --> 01:26:05.655
and possibly 60 minutes of us
not affirmed up yet.

01:26:05.864 --> 01:26:08.617
I mean, If they could just cut through
the crap and make up their minds.

01:26:08.825 --> 01:26:10.494
The eyes dont have time to delete, Ally.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.496
There are people lining up to book us.

01:26:45.403 --> 01:26:46.905
There you go honey!

01:26:48.615 --> 01:26:50.575
You look like a movie star!

01:26:52.577 --> 01:26:53.537
Ok,  Listen up, T.S.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.914
This shows rating is through the roof.

01:26:56.122 --> 01:26:57.582
But, they're gonna wanna ambush you

01:26:57.791 --> 01:26:59.960
It's just the price you have to pay, got it?

01:27:05.882 --> 01:27:08.135
He's gonna talk about Layton, for sure.

01:27:08.468 --> 01:27:10.262
So, you saw the accident ...

01:27:12.806 --> 01:27:15.684
You saw the accident,
you didn't understand what happened,

01:27:15.892 --> 01:27:18.436
you ran for help,
that's it. Remember,

01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:20.730
do not express any kind of guilt.

01:27:20.939 --> 01:27:21.773
you listening?

01:27:21.982 --> 01:27:25.026
Not until we consult with our lawyers.
You understood all that?

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.029
We're live in 5 minutes.

01:27:28.238 --> 01:27:30.323
You're gonna go back to the green room.

01:27:30.824 --> 01:27:33.743
Well.. No, surely, it is normal
for a representative of the Smithsonian...

01:27:33.952 --> 01:27:36.204
Miss Jibsen, you'll love our green room.

01:27:36.413 --> 01:27:38.039
You can watch the entire show there

01:27:38.248 --> 01:27:39.499
on a monitor.

01:27:42.294 --> 01:27:43.920
But he is only 10... I mean, ...

01:27:44.129 --> 01:27:45.881
T.S.,  Call me Roy.

01:27:45.882 --> 01:27:46.882
Hello Roy.

01:27:47.549 --> 01:27:48.967
First time on TV?

01:27:49.593 --> 01:27:50.552
Lets do it.

01:27:57.309 --> 01:27:58.727
We're live in 10 seconds.

01:27:59.686 --> 01:28:01.980
On the air in... 10, 9, 8 ...

01:28:22.792 --> 01:28:25.378
My guest tonight has dominated
this week's headlines.

01:28:25.712 --> 01:28:27.839
He is to science what Mozart is to music.

01:28:28.048 --> 01:28:30.342
T.S. Spivet, just 10 years old,

01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:32.844
and he had sprinted ahead of
legions of scientists

01:28:33.386 --> 01:28:35.430
to win this year's coveted Baird Award.

01:28:35.847 --> 01:28:38.266
T.S., you're 10 years old,

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.645
You're an orphan, you grew upon
a remote ranch in Montana,

01:28:41.812 --> 01:28:42.854
your dad wanted you to be

01:28:43.063 --> 01:28:45.273
a cowboy. Am I right so far?

01:28:46.294 --> 01:28:46.984
Hmm..Yes.

01:28:47.609 --> 01:28:50.070
Coppertop Ranch, 4.73 miles

01:28:50.237 --> 01:28:53.198
north of the Divide, 14.92 miles ...

01:28:53.365 --> 01:28:56.368
Tell me T.S., How does a 10 year old
win the Baird Award?

01:28:56.952 --> 01:28:58.620
Did the proverbial apple just fall

01:28:59.819 --> 01:29:00.247
on your head

01:29:00.455 --> 01:29:01.665
and light bulb, you invent

01:29:01.873 --> 01:29:03.750
the perpetual motion machine?

01:29:05.293 --> 01:29:06.795
It actually already existed.

01:29:07.003 --> 01:29:08.672
But, we needed to invented

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.965
was a system to ...

01:29:10.173 --> 01:29:12.592
At an age when most 10 year olds

01:29:12.801 --> 01:29:15.095
are climbing trees, what do you do for fun?

01:29:15.303 --> 01:29:16.471
Trigonometry?

01:29:17.639 --> 01:29:19.432
I like climbing trees.

01:29:22.686 --> 01:29:24.187
You've been conducting
scientific experiments

01:29:24.396 --> 01:29:26.106
since the age of 4.

01:29:26.314 --> 01:29:27.524
Last year, one of those went

01:29:27.732 --> 01:29:29.943
tragically wrong and
resulted in the death

01:29:30.152 --> 01:29:32.237
of your twin brother, Layton.

01:29:40.495 --> 01:29:42.664
I did not understand what happened.

01:29:42.998 --> 01:29:45.750
I ran to get help,
that's all.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.339
And oddly, the time has come
to take a look

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:53.383
at this extraordinary invention.

01:29:53.758 --> 01:29:56.928
This is the first
perpetual motion machine

01:29:57.137 --> 01:29:59.264
in the history of mankind.

01:30:19.437 --> 01:30:21.614
Well, T.S.
How does it work...

01:30:21.745 --> 01:30:24.080
Liza! Do you see him?

01:30:25.457 --> 01:30:27.542
That's is my brother.
I can't believe he is on TV!

01:30:28.877 --> 01:30:32.506
I mean, This is the same spice that wore
Velcro on his shoes untill he's 8 years old

01:30:32.714 --> 01:30:34.925
because he couldn't tie his own laces.

01:30:35.133 --> 01:30:36.593
he is on TV!

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.932
He went that time when he almost electrocuted
me with his seismograph.

01:30:42.516 --> 01:30:45.018
Oh thats,
its not mention that on TV ...

01:30:46.561 --> 01:30:49.523
T.S., how long can the little wheel turn

01:30:49.731 --> 01:30:51.233
and produce energy

01:30:51.441 --> 01:30:53.026
without consuming energy?

01:30:53.527 --> 01:30:56.738
400 years
then you have to recharge the magnets.

01:30:57.057 --> 01:30:57.822
400 years!

01:30:57.989 --> 01:31:00.700
so, you saying
if this machine were 100 times larger

01:31:00.951 --> 01:31:03.995
it could power all of the lights in this building
for 400 years

01:31:04.204 --> 01:31:06.373
without spending a dime in electricity?

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.959
Well, you still have to
change the light bulbs

01:31:09.167 --> 01:31:11.795
given the ratio of lighting square footage,

01:31:12.254 --> 01:31:13.922
that's still significant cost.

01:31:15.507 --> 01:31:17.634
I think the time has come
to introduce a

01:31:17.843 --> 01:31:19.219
very special guest,

01:31:19.678 --> 01:31:22.139
T.S.'s mother, Dr. Clair.

01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:38.727
Hello T.S.

01:31:39.858 --> 01:31:41.381
Hello Mom.

01:31:44.452 --> 01:31:47.497
Dr. Clair,
you have come here directly from Montana

01:31:47.706 --> 01:31:50.250
you are T.S.'s mother, correct?

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.392
Yes. That's right.

01:31:53.753 --> 01:31:57.007
T.S., why did you say
in the media that you

01:31:57.215 --> 01:31:59.801
were an orphan, is this some spin
coming from the Smithsonian?

01:32:01.344 --> 01:32:02.554
I don't know.

01:32:03.096 --> 01:32:06.266
I thought they would send me back home
before I could receive the award.

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.352
Dr. Clair, You must have been
worried sick,

01:32:09.561 --> 01:32:11.146
I mean, he is so small.

01:32:12.772 --> 01:32:14.733
Yes, well, when a child disappears,

01:32:14.941 --> 01:32:16.526
the world stops turning.

01:32:17.569 --> 01:32:20.655
But, surely you must have been very angry.
When you heard..

01:32:20.864 --> 01:32:21.656
With all the respect

01:32:21.865 --> 01:32:24.034
You asked me a question,
I would like to finish my answer.

01:32:26.328 --> 01:32:28.497
When your child disappears

01:32:29.289 --> 01:32:30.999
well, you'll  lose your sanity.

01:32:31.666 --> 01:32:34.419
Some will channel their anger by kicking
goats out of barbwire.

01:32:34.628 --> 01:32:36.713
I'm sorry..Goats!
We're talking goats?

01:32:37.631 --> 01:32:40.592
Others will surf
the beetles that don't exist.

01:32:42.219 --> 01:32:44.763
Those are just feared merely take a train
that is never coming back

01:32:44.971 --> 01:32:47.140
so sometimes you just stop by the tracks,

01:32:47.349 --> 01:32:49.017
and stare at the rails.

01:32:52.687 --> 01:32:54.189
So you read my journal ...

01:32:57.984 --> 01:32:59.027
I'm sorry.

01:32:59.569 --> 01:33:01.112
I know it's not right.

01:33:02.113 --> 01:33:04.533
What about giving a gun
to a child as a gift?

01:33:06.576 --> 01:33:08.286
Or letting two kids play

01:33:08.912 --> 01:33:10.497
with a gun, in a barn,

01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.707
unsupervised...

01:33:14.376 --> 01:33:15.293
You think that's right?

01:33:15.961 --> 01:33:17.212
That's good question actually!

01:33:17.213 --> 01:33:18.213
T.S.

01:33:19.172 --> 01:33:20.757
What happened in the barn?

01:33:24.894 --> 01:33:26.096
Wasn't your fault, T.S.

01:33:29.141 --> 01:33:30.809
It wasn't your fault.

01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:34.848
It wasn't.

01:33:36.773 --> 01:33:38.650
It wasn't anyone's fault.

01:33:41.278 --> 01:33:42.696
It was an accident.

01:33:44.948 --> 01:33:46.575
As your father said,

01:33:47.367 --> 01:33:48.743
what happened ...

01:33:51.454 --> 01:33:52.747
just happened...

01:33:55.732 --> 01:33:57.882
OK, I think,

01:33:57.961 --> 01:33:59.588
T.S. .. Dr Clair

01:33:59.796 --> 01:34:01.423
We should,..
We should have a moment.

01:34:01.631 --> 01:34:02.841
Just...just forget the cameras

01:34:03.049 --> 01:34:04.176
and the audience,

01:34:04.468 --> 01:34:06.094
and just.. maybe...

01:34:07.304 --> 01:34:08.054
hug?

01:34:09.306 --> 01:34:11.308
Cry?
Touch, maybe?

01:34:11.516 --> 01:34:13.977
Actually, I wanna ask you about
beauty pageants.

01:34:14.519 --> 01:34:15.979
I know Miss America

01:34:16.188 --> 01:34:17.189
and Miss USA different,

01:34:17.397 --> 01:34:18.815
But the criteria they use

01:34:19.024 --> 01:34:21.776
..is shameful..
Why?..

01:34:22.319 --> 01:34:23.153
Mom!
Mom!

01:34:23.612 --> 01:34:25.655
I guess the crown necessarily
be a ravishing beauty...

01:34:25.864 --> 01:34:26.698
..underfed...
Mom!

01:34:28.033 --> 01:34:28.825
What?

01:34:29.684 --> 01:34:30.192
Oh, Yeah.

01:34:30.619 --> 01:34:31.870
You will stay here or go?

01:34:32.287 --> 01:34:32.954
Go.

01:34:46.593 --> 01:34:47.844
A river... of emotion ...

01:34:48.678 --> 01:34:50.555
No, No, come back!

01:34:51.014 --> 01:34:54.392
This is a 20 minute interview,
there's 9 minutes left.

01:35:01.024 --> 01:35:03.443
This is reality, this is better than science!

01:35:03.652 --> 01:35:05.278
This is cable TV.

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.865
You're a filthy little liar.

01:35:10.617 --> 01:35:12.327
You're a little m***r.

01:35:15.330 --> 01:35:15.914
Wait! wait! Oh!

01:35:17.624 --> 01:35:18.750
Where do you think
you are going?

01:35:18.959 --> 01:35:20.752
To Coppertop ranch.

01:35:32.556 --> 01:35:33.515
Cut!

01:35:35.475 --> 01:35:36.476
You OK?

01:35:40.147 --> 01:35:42.566
Reckon if you're OK,
that's all it gots!

01:35:43.984 --> 01:35:45.569
My boy's OK.

01:35:48.613 --> 01:35:50.448
So, I'm mute..

01:35:50.657 --> 01:35:51.491
and I'm dead?

01:35:53.410 --> 01:35:54.786
Sorry, Dad.

01:36:03.795 --> 01:36:07.215
How come you didn't stop that morning
when you saw me on the road?

01:36:08.675 --> 01:36:10.760
Rancher's word , I never saw you.

01:36:52.427 --> 01:36:59.793
I need a box of biscuits, a box of mixed biscuits
and a biscuit mixer.

01:36:59.851 --> 01:37:02.479
Are you talking to me or
are you talking to the peanut butter?

01:37:03.188 --> 01:37:05.190
Its a diction exercise, moron.

01:37:05.398 --> 01:37:07.734
You'd be better out trying
some yourself enough here

01:37:07.943 --> 01:37:09.736
or make it on TV again.

01:37:10.278 --> 01:37:12.405
I've got some more to do in the
public speaking department.

01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:15.784
How about you just show us
how its done the day you're in a movie.

01:37:16.117 --> 01:37:18.411
Yeah, or in the running for Miss Montana.

01:37:20.872 --> 01:37:24.167
Or a reality show
about a normal person

01:37:24.376 --> 01:37:26.962
living with a bunch of
insane hostile degenerates.

01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:29.673
Speaking of which, does anyone know

01:37:30.382 --> 01:37:34.136
if or when your father is showing
up for breakfast?

01:37:46.815 --> 01:37:48.441
You guys don't ever made up?

01:37:51.695 --> 01:37:54.781
Look, I know goats eat everything,
including paper... I get'em, I get'em.

01:37:55.991 --> 01:37:57.617
But, the fact that one of them

01:37:57.826 --> 01:38:00.328
climbed through the kitchen window
and eat all my notes

01:38:00.537 --> 01:38:04.332
on the female Ontophagus sagittarius,
and how it copulates with its horns

01:38:04.541 --> 01:38:05.542
that is inexcusable.

01:38:08.628 --> 01:38:09.546
It's okay, it's okay.

01:38:11.089 --> 01:38:12.132
He's just kicking.

01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:14.468
I thought you're going to give birth
on the kitchen again?

01:38:14.676 --> 01:38:17.721
Again?
I never gave birth in kitchen.

01:38:18.054 --> 01:38:18.972
Really?

01:38:19.598 --> 01:38:21.850
Then, why is my name Sparrow?

01:38:22.184 --> 01:38:23.894
No, That was Gracie's idea.

01:38:24.102 --> 01:38:26.313
She found a dead sparrow

01:38:26.521 --> 01:38:29.107
here in the kitchen,
the day I had you in the hospital.

01:38:29.316 --> 01:38:33.278
So she concluded that you were
the reincarnation of the sparrow.

01:38:33.737 --> 01:38:35.989
I know when I die,
an elephant will be born.

01:38:41.578 --> 01:38:43.205
<i> Statistically speaking, </i>

01:38:43.413 --> 01:38:46.333

next newborn Spivet, will be</i>

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.293
