00:06.930 --> 00:09.600
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss you, Blue Jeans. Mwah!

00:09.640 --> 00:11.540
I swear, Miley Ray,

00:11.540 --> 00:12.970
I don't know how you people

00:13.010 --> 00:16.510
can go back to the smoggy, crowded California

00:16.540 --> 00:18.740
and leave the peace and serenity

00:18.780 --> 00:21.050
that is the great state of Tennessee.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.220
Earl! Get a move on!

00:23.250 --> 00:25.950
Them hogs ain't gonna slop themselves!

00:25.990 --> 00:27.520
I'm comin', Pearl!

00:29.290 --> 00:30.620
Please take me with you.

00:30.750 --> 00:33.010
All I need is a toothbrush and a pair of undershorts

00:33.050 --> 00:34.880
and I'm good for a month.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.850
Uncle Earl, as much as we'd love to have you

00:36.880 --> 00:38.850
and your extra-strength undershorts...

00:38.890 --> 00:41.290
I call them thundershorts.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.290
Of course you do, Uncle Earl.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.430
I need someone here to take care of Blue Jeans,

00:45.460 --> 00:47.190
someone that I know really loves him.

00:47.230 --> 00:50.530
Aw, yeah. I was just kiddin'.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.830
- I'll take good care of him.  - Mwah!

00:52.870 --> 00:54.370
I always do.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.970
All right, sweetie.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.970
I'll leave you to say your goodbyes.

00:59.410 --> 01:03.140
Ugh! Day fourteen's always the hardest.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.250
Day one's no picnic, either.

01:11.290 --> 01:14.050
- Who said that? - Who do you think said it?

01:15.390 --> 01:17.920
The one you're leaving behind again, that's who!

01:17.960 --> 01:21.900
- You can talk? - Don't change the subject.

01:21.930 --> 01:24.030
There's another horse, isn't there?

01:24.070 --> 01:25.330
A Hollywood horse.

01:25.370 --> 01:27.100
More razzle-dazzle.

01:27.130 --> 01:30.300
No, there's no other horse, I swear.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.940
Then why do you keep leavin' me, Mile? Don't leave me.

01:33.980 --> 01:36.210
D-d-d-d-don't leave me.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.810
I'm sorry.

01:39.050 --> 01:41.350
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.850
I'm sorry. I'm sor...

01:43.880 --> 01:45.490
Blue Jeans?

01:45.520 --> 01:48.390
Miley, are you OK?

01:48.420 --> 01:50.560
Yeah, I'm fine. I just had a bad dream.

01:50.590 --> 01:54.960
OK. Hey, if you wanna talk, I'll be right...

You get the limo out front.

02:11.210 --> 02:14.580
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

02:14.620 --> 02:17.980
Yeah when your famous it can be kinda fun.

02:18.020 --> 02:23.060
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

02:23.090 --> 02:26.590
Who would've thought that a girl like me

02:26.630 --> 02:31.000
Would double as a superstar?

02:32.400 --> 02:36.340
You get the best of both worlds.

02:36.370 --> 02:38.370
Chill it out, take it slow,

02:38.410 --> 02:40.140
then you rock out the show.

02:40.170 --> 02:44.080
You get the best of both worlds.

02:44.110 --> 02:46.810
Mix it all together and you know that

02:46.850 --> 02:50.250
It's the best of both worlds.

02:52.140 --> 02:53.910
Hannah Montana  S03E29  Miley Says Goodbye Part 1

02:54.060 --> 02:56.990
I swear, the dream was so real.

02:57.020 --> 03:00.490
He just kept saying, "I-I-I-I need you, Mile."

03:00.530 --> 03:02.060
And it sounds just like something

03:02.100 --> 03:03.930
Blue Jeans would say if he was missing me.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.430
That's weird. I always thought Blue Jeans would sound

03:06.470 --> 03:08.330
a whole lot more like Clint Eastwood.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.470
Go ahead, punk. Make my hay.

03:13.510 --> 03:17.440
Wow. Worst imitation ever.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.080
Oh, you should hear his Spock.

03:19.110 --> 03:21.680
It would be totally illogical

03:21.720 --> 03:25.520
for you to think I cannot hear you from this distance.

03:25.550 --> 03:26.620
Nailed it!

03:29.120 --> 03:31.890
I'm gonna call Uncle Earl and check on Blue Jeans.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.600
Hey, interloper.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.900
College word. Look it up.

03:38.930 --> 03:42.200
- You're in my seat. - Since when is it your seat?

03:42.240 --> 03:43.740
Why don't you feel underneath?

03:46.310 --> 03:47.540
Those are my boogies.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.110
Eww!

03:51.810 --> 03:53.950
Son, I want that thing scraped and disinfected

03:53.980 --> 03:55.350
by tomorrow morning.

03:55.380 --> 03:57.750
Dad, I've been sitting in this chair for five years.

03:57.790 --> 04:00.320
I'd need a jackhammer and a blowtorch.

04:00.350 --> 04:02.720
I can still feel it! It's under my nails!

04:02.760 --> 04:04.560
It's under my nails!

04:05.790 --> 04:07.590
OK. I think I'm just gonna go

04:07.590 --> 04:10.700
out on the deck now, as I so often do,

04:10.700 --> 04:12.670
and pray for the strength to carry on.

04:13.730 --> 04:16.899
Hey, Uncle Earl. I just wanna see how Blue Jeans is doing.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.170
Well, it's a funny thing you called, Mile.

04:19.209 --> 04:22.310
He's been out of sorts ever since you left last week.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.040
I can't even get him to eat this morning.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.780
Come on, Blue Jeans. This is good stuff.

04:27.820 --> 04:29.620
Mmm, yeah, I'm sure it's real good.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.990
Hey, that is good!

04:36.020 --> 04:37.760
Let me talk to him.

04:37.790 --> 04:41.030
Let me step outside to give you two your privacy.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.360
U-U-Uncle Earl. Uncle Earl, you're gonna...

04:43.400 --> 04:46.200
You're gonna have to hold the phone for the horse.

04:46.230 --> 04:48.640
Oh, yeah. I knew that.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.100
All right, here you go.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.940
<i>Hey, Blue Jeans.</i>

04:52.970 --> 04:54.710
Listen, I really miss you, too.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.180
But you've gotta eat for me, OK? Please?

04:58.210 --> 05:00.980
Well, jumpin' Johnny Cash, would you look at that?

05:01.020 --> 05:02.550
He's eating, Mile!

05:02.580 --> 05:05.120
Good boy. I'm so proud of you.

05:05.150 --> 05:08.190
Aw, thanks. I do what I can.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.720
Bye, Uncle Earl. Thanks.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.090
Bye, doll.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.760
Are you gonna finish that?

05:19.870 --> 05:21.730
See? I knew that dream meant something.

05:21.770 --> 05:24.370
Wow. So your horse really was missing you.

05:24.410 --> 05:27.110
Man, it's like you two have some sort of psychic connection.

05:27.140 --> 05:28.440
Well, we grew up together.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.010
He's like the brother I never had.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.980
"Brother I never had."

05:34.010 --> 05:36.550
Miles, you gotta do it with me or I look kinda stupid.

05:36.580 --> 05:38.420
OK, I'm sorry. I was kind of tired.

05:38.450 --> 05:40.020
I didn't get much sleep last night.

05:40.050 --> 05:42.590
And BTW, you don't need my help to look stupid.

05:43.590 --> 05:44.820
- Burn! - Burn!

05:44.860 --> 05:46.290
- Burn! - Burn!

05:46.330 --> 05:48.060
Ah, forget it. It's not the same.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.260
Miley, are you gonna finish your breakfast?

05:51.300 --> 05:53.430
Only thing I wanna finish is a good night's sleep.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.110
One lousy phone call

05:59.140 --> 06:01.610
and now you think everything's all hunky-dory?

06:01.640 --> 06:04.210
Don't you get it, little girl? I need ya.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.910
I also need an apple, but Earl ate that, too.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.650
What are you looking at?

06:09.680 --> 06:12.120
This is a healthy alternative...

06:12.150 --> 06:13.590
...to this.

06:15.790 --> 06:19.960
Miley, don't just lie there. D-d-d-d... Help me!

06:24.830 --> 06:26.170
Dad, I need a favor.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.800
You want Blue Jeans out here.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.640
Yeah, I miss him and he misses me

06:29.670 --> 06:31.370
and Earl keeps eating all his apples

06:31.410 --> 06:34.570
and I keep "p-p-b-b...leavin' him" and...

06:34.610 --> 06:35.680
Wait. How'd you know?

06:35.710 --> 06:37.280
You've been mumbling "Blue Jeans"

06:37.310 --> 06:39.610
for the last 20 minutes in your sleep.

06:39.650 --> 06:43.050
Any other conclusion would be totally illogical.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.650
Nailed it again!

06:44.690 --> 06:45.650
Ha-ha!

06:45.690 --> 06:47.790
Hot today!

07:01.700 --> 07:04.170
- What happened? - Jackson! Bath tub!

07:04.200 --> 07:05.540
It was horrible!

07:07.540 --> 07:11.080
You are lucky that I double-bubbled, missy.

07:11.110 --> 07:12.580
Dad!

07:13.110 --> 07:15.150
Dad!

07:15.180 --> 07:16.950
That is it, all right?

07:16.980 --> 07:20.690
If I'm old enough to go to college and old enough to vote,

07:20.720 --> 07:22.490
then I'm old enough to get my own place.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.460
Where you can make a bubble beard in private?

07:25.490 --> 07:29.060
Yes, if I so desire.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.470
Hey, way to lock the bathroom door,

07:33.500 --> 07:35.470
soap on a dope.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.370
That is exactly what I'm talking about.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.440
Maybe you can live in this festering female fungus,

07:40.470 --> 07:41.910
but I can't, all right?

07:41.940 --> 07:44.210
It is time for this rooster to spread his wings

07:44.240 --> 07:45.850
and bust out of the hen house.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.980
Well fine, go ahead and cock-a-doodle-do it.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.550
- Really? - Why, sure.

07:51.590 --> 07:54.150
Moving out's an important step in a young man's life

07:54.190 --> 07:55.150
and I support it.

07:55.190 --> 07:57.160
So do I. I just have one request.

07:57.190 --> 07:58.790
When you come crawling home

07:58.790 --> 08:00.390
because you can't handle life on your own,

08:00.430 --> 08:02.930
just call first so I can get my video camera set up.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.860
OK. Well, videotape this.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.100
I'm gonna get my own place and it's gonna be great,

08:07.130 --> 08:08.700
because no matter what you think,

08:08.740 --> 08:11.400
I'm a responsible, mature adult.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.880
I am so happy that you're finally here.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.980
Well, hon, I'm happy I'm here, too,

08:25.020 --> 08:28.090
but you should say something nice to the horse.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.460
Good idea, Uncle Earl.

08:31.830 --> 08:34.289
We are gonna have so much fun.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.230
Again, honey, to the horse.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.799
She knows I can't stay, right?

08:40.830 --> 08:42.070
Well, Earl,

08:42.070 --> 08:44.140
I've been waiting for just the right moment to break it to her.

08:44.169 --> 08:46.510
You are such a good daddy.

08:46.540 --> 08:48.840
Oh, yeah!

09:11.230 --> 09:12.570
Oh!

09:12.600 --> 09:15.740
Dude, this place is incredible.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.100
But, and, you know,

09:17.140 --> 09:19.870
I hope you don't take this the wrong way,

09:19.910 --> 09:21.510
it's so clean.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.640
Dude, I know. And it's gonna stay that way.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.110
Miley doesn't think that I can handle living on my own,

09:26.150 --> 09:27.110
but I'll show her.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.820
Check it out.

09:30.180 --> 09:32.320
One hundred percent boogie-free!

09:32.350 --> 09:33.550
Oh!

09:33.590 --> 09:36.660
It's like I don't even know you anymore.

09:37.930 --> 09:39.930
I've become a man, my friend.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.100
What is that?

09:45.130 --> 09:47.570
I have a rock band living above me.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.840
- It's so loud. - I know.

09:49.870 --> 09:52.310
- It's so cool! - I know!

10:00.010 --> 10:01.880
Oh, hey, there, Lilly.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.450
Whoo! That is one handsome sandwich you got there.

10:04.490 --> 10:06.950
Yeah, well, I do work in a sub shop.

10:06.990 --> 10:08.520
It shows, too.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.510
You know, when Mile makes a sandwich,

10:11.550 --> 10:14.520
she usually makes one for me, too, but that's just Mile.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.490
Uh-huh.

10:17.820 --> 10:19.960
I guess it's her way of showing her appreciation

10:19.990 --> 10:22.030
for me putting this roof over her head.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.530
How you like living here?

10:28.070 --> 10:29.130
Here.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.630
For me?

10:30.670 --> 10:32.670
Oh, thank you, Lilly.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.370
You know what else Mile does?

10:34.410 --> 10:36.710
- Iced tea or lemonade? - Little bit of both.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.880
- Yeah. - Don't be stingy with the ice.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.310
Oh!

10:41.350 --> 10:43.910
Do I have a serious case

10:43.950 --> 10:45.750
of saddle butt or what?

10:47.650 --> 10:49.090
But I don't care.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.950
Blue Jeans and I had... Ow!

10:50.990 --> 10:52.990
...so much fun today.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.320
- Ooh, that looks great. - Yeah, it sure does.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.330
- Lilly made it for me. - Hey, Lil!

10:57.360 --> 10:58.590
How you like living here?

11:00.100 --> 11:02.870
- White or wheat? - Wheat, please.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.440
Blue Jeans and I had so much fun. It was the best day ever.

11:05.470 --> 11:06.840
Well, I'm not surprised.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.310
Riding Blue Jeans always did put a smile on your face.

11:09.340 --> 11:11.070
Yeah, you said the key to being happy

11:11.110 --> 11:12.940
is never forgetting where you come from,

11:12.980 --> 11:14.840
and being out there on Blue Jeans today,

11:14.880 --> 11:16.780
it felt like I was back in Crowley Corners.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.450
Bringing Blue Jeans here was the best thing I ever did.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.850
Cool.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.290
Hello.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.350
Oh, hey, Burt.

11:25.390 --> 11:26.390
What?!

11:27.660 --> 11:29.230
I-I'll be there right away.

11:29.260 --> 11:30.690
What happened?

11:30.730 --> 11:33.360
Blue Jeans. He ran away.

11:41.270 --> 11:43.610
Bringing Blue Jeans here was the dumbest thing I ever did.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.240
Miley, we're gonna find him, OK?

11:45.280 --> 11:47.710
The stable's looking, you already called the police.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.280
And I am gonna make up a lost horse poster right now.

11:50.420 --> 11:53.460
Lilly's right. Everything's gonna turn out fine, Mile.

11:53.490 --> 11:54.940
Remember when you was eight years old

11:54.940 --> 11:56.260
and your kitty ran away?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.860
We looked all over the place for it.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.700
Turned out it was hiding under the kitchen sink the whole time.

12:00.730 --> 12:03.970
Why didn't I think of that?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.940
I bet he's under the sink.

12:06.970 --> 12:10.210
I mean, if I was a 1,500-pound horse,

12:10.240 --> 12:12.180
this is exactly where I would be.

12:14.090 --> 12:15.650
- Blue Jeans? - Mile.

12:15.690 --> 12:18.090
- Miley. - Blue Jeans, is that you?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.290
Oh, wait. There you are!

12:20.330 --> 12:22.460
Oh, good boy! You came home.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.130
Good boy!

12:24.160 --> 12:25.960
Mile, stop waving that thing around.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.930
You're gonna scare the horse in the window.

12:27.970 --> 12:30.370
Dad, this is not time for one of your little...

12:30.400 --> 12:31.840
Blue Jeans!

12:31.870 --> 12:35.540
- You half scared me to death. - Good thing he showed up.

12:35.570 --> 12:38.480
I don't think Lilly's lost horse picture would've helped much.

12:38.510 --> 12:42.180
Hey, I was gonna color it in, OK?

12:45.520 --> 12:48.220
Here we go, boy. Back home safe and sound.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.260
OK, all right.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.560
I admit the legs may be a little off,

12:54.590 --> 12:56.360
but I think I got his eye right.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.870
You know what? I believe you did.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.670
That's actually very, very good.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.970
Wait. He's just doing that supportive dad thing, isn't he?

13:09.010 --> 13:10.710
Well, he's trying, but let's admit it,

13:10.740 --> 13:12.540
you're not giving him much to work with.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.150
You do make a very good sandwich.

13:16.180 --> 13:18.550
A little heavy on the mayo, though.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.450
OK, buddy.

13:24.290 --> 13:25.920
Now, this isn't Tennessee.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.290
You can't just walk across the yard to my window

13:28.330 --> 13:29.560
when you miss me.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.900
'Cause here my window is six miles away

13:31.930 --> 13:34.400
past the freeway, past the mini mall

13:34.430 --> 13:37.270
and then across Will Ferrell's backyard.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.600
Not such a funny man

13:38.640 --> 13:41.170
when your horsey takes a whiz on his hammock.

13:41.210 --> 13:43.270
Yeah. It's not like he was in it.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.740
Oh.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.480
Hey, Mile. It's been a long day.

13:47.510 --> 13:49.580
You and Blue Jeans both need to get some rest.

13:49.610 --> 13:50.780
Yeah, right.

13:52.350 --> 13:54.520
Good night, Blue Jeans.

13:54.550 --> 13:55.590
Sleep tight.

13:57.460 --> 13:59.460
Now, be a good boy and stay.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.030
Stay.

14:02.060 --> 14:04.630
Stay. I'll see you first thing tomorrow morning.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.700
Love you.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.380
Not exactly what I had in mind.

14:26.650 --> 14:30.020
OK. Now, this time I mean it. Stay.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.760
Don't you me...

14:34.790 --> 14:36.430
Now, stay.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.660
Good boy. Huh?

14:49.310 --> 14:52.440
Whoever you are, you're blocking my sun.

14:53.510 --> 14:55.150
Oh, sweet niblets.

14:56.510 --> 14:59.480
OK, so I've got a stable hand checking on him every hour,

14:59.520 --> 15:01.290
I put my favorite scarf around his neck,

15:01.320 --> 15:02.720
with my favorite perfume on it,

15:02.750 --> 15:05.820
and I've got Indiana Joannie on a continuous loop.

15:05.860 --> 15:08.790
Now, if that doesn't do it, I don't know what will.

15:08.830 --> 15:11.030
I'm not lying, Mr. Donavan.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.030
A horse ate my homework. Really.

15:14.830 --> 15:15.770
Oh, no.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.740
Oh, yes.

15:20.470 --> 15:22.240
Hey, Stewart, your friend here

15:22.270 --> 15:24.210
tried to cut in front of me in the cafeteria,

15:24.240 --> 15:26.810
but I said "Neigh!"

15:36.250 --> 15:37.860
- Goal! - Goal!

15:37.890 --> 15:40.190
- Goal! Goal! Goal! - Goal! Goal! Goal!

15:40.230 --> 15:41.630
- Wait. You hear that? - What?

15:41.660 --> 15:45.900
The beautiful sound of a Miley-free living environment.

15:45.930 --> 15:47.930
Jackson, I know you guys have your problems,

15:47.970 --> 15:49.000
but Miley's my bud.

15:49.030 --> 15:50.930
Get out!

15:50.970 --> 15:53.900
I mean, was my bud.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.670
Yesterday. Not anymore.

15:55.710 --> 15:57.510
I mean, you say Miley, I say who?

15:57.540 --> 15:59.810
- Miley. Miley. - Who? Who?

15:59.840 --> 16:01.010
I'm gonna get us a drink.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.180
Oh, dog!

16:05.180 --> 16:07.580
I think your fridge was a porta-potty in a former life.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.450
- Really? - Yeah.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.690
Jackson, it's not even cold in there.

16:19.860 --> 16:21.130
OK, OK.

16:21.170 --> 16:22.700
No problem.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.440
When something goes wrong,

16:24.470 --> 16:26.800
you don't panic, you just... you call the landlord.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.340
That's what a mature adult does.

16:29.370 --> 16:31.140
- Can I get some chips? - Help yourself.

16:31.180 --> 16:32.310
Cool.

16:36.380 --> 16:38.120
Um, Jackson.

16:45.590 --> 16:48.830
You might wanna keep the landlord on speed dial.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.310
Hello?

17:02.210 --> 17:04.410
Oh, hey, Dad.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.109
What's the matter, you missing me already?

17:07.150 --> 17:10.710
Well, as hard as it is for me to believe, I do.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.220
So, anyhow, I was thinking about

17:12.250 --> 17:14.150
stopping by just a little bit later and...

17:14.190 --> 17:15.650
And what? Check up on me?

17:15.690 --> 17:17.390
'Cause you think that I'm dumb enough

17:17.420 --> 17:19.790
to rent a fully furnished apartment that looks great

17:19.790 --> 17:22.130
but is falling apart faster than a pair of Fudgy Buddy boots?

17:23.190 --> 17:25.300
I just wanted to bring you over a welcome pie.

17:25.329 --> 17:26.530
No! No, no.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.770
Don't, no, Dad, Dad.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.640
I already had pie.

17:31.670 --> 17:33.840
Yeah, I... I baked it myself.

17:33.870 --> 17:37.370
In my awesome kitchen.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.510
Ooh!

17:41.550 --> 17:43.880
- What was that? - Nothing.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.620
I'm just... I'm watching a TV show

17:45.650 --> 17:47.890
where they blow a lot of stuff up, yeah.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.950
Ooh, they're about ready to smash together

17:49.990 --> 17:52.360
a watermelon and a cantaloupe in a Super Collider.

17:52.390 --> 17:54.730
I gotta go. Don't come over till I tell you to. Bye.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.900
Oliver, what happened?

17:57.930 --> 17:59.630
Uh... nothing.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.230
Just, you know, if...

18:02.270 --> 18:04.130
if the landlord doesn't get here soon,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.870
you might need to build a boat.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.010
If you tell one more lame joke,

18:08.040 --> 18:09.640
you might need to call the doctor.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.340
- Here. - Oh.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.580
I was hoping for a towel, but thank you.

18:16.980 --> 18:19.480
At least we got music while we work.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.750
These guys are good.

18:20.790 --> 18:22.220
Hey, crank it up!

18:22.250 --> 18:24.620
I hear that!

18:29.460 --> 18:30.930
Thank you.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.270
I'll just leave you alone with your thoughts.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.940
And your debris.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.210
Yep.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.940
Finally!

18:48.470 --> 18:49.740
Come on in!

18:50.710 --> 18:52.780
Hello!

18:52.810 --> 18:54.180
What are you doing here?!

18:54.210 --> 18:55.550
- I live here! - I own this place!

18:55.580 --> 18:56.880
What?! Stop that!

18:56.920 --> 18:58.720
You own this place?

18:58.750 --> 19:00.320
I own the whole block.

19:00.350 --> 19:03.660
This apartment is falling apart!

19:03.690 --> 19:05.660
I know. I was gonna use it for storage

19:05.690 --> 19:08.230
until I found out someone actually rented it.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.700
I couldn't figure out who could be so stupid.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.400
Now it all makes sense.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.700
You know, I would insult you back,

19:15.730 --> 19:18.740
but I am a mature adult with my own apartment.

19:18.770 --> 19:19.900
You don't have a comeback.

19:19.940 --> 19:22.610
No, I'm mature. Now fix my stuff!

19:22.610 --> 19:24.790
Napoleon Bonaparte-ment owner.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.650
Still can't believe someone rented this dump.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.050
I know. He's an idiot.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.920
Very funny, very funny! Now get out of my apartment!

19:36.960 --> 19:39.220
You're welcome.

19:44.030 --> 19:47.100
Well, at least everything's fixed.

20:03.250 --> 20:06.480
Blue Jeans, you can't follow me.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.190
Go home.

20:08.220 --> 20:10.350
Go home, go home.

20:10.390 --> 20:12.890
That's what I'm tryin' to do.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.500
OK, I thought when I brought you out here

20:19.530 --> 20:22.030
this was the end of these little late night chit-chats.

20:22.030 --> 20:23.870
Dangflabbit, Miley,

20:23.870 --> 20:26.800
I never wanted you to bring me out here in the first place.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.270
Then why'd you keep saying,

20:28.310 --> 20:30.910
"I-I-I need you, Mile. I need you"?

20:30.940 --> 20:34.310
What I meant was I needed you to come back home to Tennessee.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.380
What?

20:35.410 --> 20:37.150
Mile, Tennessee's a part of you

20:37.180 --> 20:39.450
and you've been living without it for too long.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.290
But I don't wanna go back to Tennessee.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.820
- Yes, you do. - No, I don't.

20:42.860 --> 20:43.960
- Do, too! - Do not!

20:43.990 --> 20:45.790
- Do, too! - Do not!

20:45.820 --> 20:48.260
All right, that's it.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.360
I'm ending this dream right now.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.610
That's better.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.450
Nice try, but I'm not done yet.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.920
Why do you think you're so happy

21:12.950 --> 21:15.290
when you're back in Crowley Corners?

21:15.320 --> 21:16.790
Why do you think you were smiling

21:16.820 --> 21:18.520
when we were riding the other day?

21:18.560 --> 21:20.830
- Well, I...  - Face it, Mile.

21:20.860 --> 21:22.630
You know what you really want.

21:22.660 --> 21:25.200
I am not just gonna pack up my life

21:25.230 --> 21:28.330
and move back to Tennessee because my horse told me to.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.370
Come on, I'm not just your horse.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.570
I'm what you're feeling. I'm what's in your heart.

21:34.610 --> 21:36.910
I'm, I'm, I'm...

21:36.940 --> 21:38.210
You're what?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.850
I'm you.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.230
Hey, Mile. I'm going to the market.

21:57.260 --> 21:59.060
You got any special requests?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.470
Just one.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.070
I wanna move back to Tennessee.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.910
Oh, oh

22:15.800 --> 22:19.300
And now I just don't know

22:19.330 --> 22:20.800
Who I really am

22:20.830 --> 22:22.570
How it's gonna be

22:22.600 --> 22:26.140
Is there something that I can't see

22:26.170 --> 22:28.910
I wanna understand

22:28.940 --> 22:32.510
Maybe I will never be

22:32.550 --> 22:35.280
Who I was before

22:35.320 --> 22:39.750
Maybe I don't even know her anymore

22:40.990 --> 22:44.290
Well, maybe who I am today

22:44.320 --> 22:47.290
Ain't so far from yesterday

22:47.330 --> 22:50.860
Can I find a way to be

22:52.400 --> 22:56.070
Every part of me

22:57.305 --> 23:03.534
