00:02.001 --> 00:03.169
Previously on Lost:

00:03.253 --> 00:04.504
It was them. The Others.

00:04.588 --> 00:07.131
Have you seen other people
on this island?

00:07.216 --> 00:11.552
I hear them out there in the jungle.
They whisper.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.437
They've attacked us,
sabotaged us, abducted us.

00:21.522 --> 00:26.359
We're not the only people
on this island, and we all know it.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.695
It's time we started worrying
about them.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.531
They came the first night,
took three of us.

00:31.615 --> 00:35.576
Then they came back, and took nine more.

00:35.661 --> 00:38.538
They're smart, and they're animals,

00:38.622 --> 00:41.541
and they could be anywhere at any time.

00:41.792 --> 00:47.797
And if you think that one gun and one
bullet is gonna stop them, think again.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.136
Shannon.

01:01.145 --> 01:05.773
This is not your island.
This is our island.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.401
And the only reason you're living on it

01:08.485 --> 01:10.695
is because we let you live on it.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.905
- Drop. Get down. Get the hell down.
- Get down.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.783
You. No, drop your gun
on the ground now.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.951
- Freeze.
- Stop burning that stuff.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.078
- Get the hell down.
- Get down.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.206
Who's in charge here?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.461
I said who's in charge?

02:09.838 --> 02:12.632
Somebody better tell them to stop,
or he's dead.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.260
- They don't understand, Sergeant.
- They understand. Listen up.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.388
I'll fire on three. One, two...

02:25.729 --> 02:28.105
You.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.983
- You in charge?
- No, I am not.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.569
Who is?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.658
There is no commanding officer here.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.828
He left two hours ago for Hillah.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.163
Your English is good, Abdul.

02:44.248 --> 02:47.416
But you're lying.
And that ain't so good.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.933
That's him, Sergeant.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.979
Let's go, hombre.

03:12.109 --> 03:16.279
Son, we don't wanna be here
any more than you do,

03:16.363 --> 03:20.074
but your pal Saddam
had to go marching into Kuwait.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.869
Here we all are.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.622
Buccelli here says you speak English.
You ever do any translating?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.875
Formally, no.

03:28.959 --> 03:34.797
Hell. Fact that you know
what "formally" means... We're good.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.635
Apache helicopter went down
in this sector two days ago.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.054
Our sources tell us
the pilot was captured.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.182
It's very important
that we get this pilot back.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.728
He was taken to the Republican
Guard intelligence commander,

03:48.812 --> 03:51.564
a man named Tariq.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.568
- Do you know him?
- Yes. He was our commanding officer.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.571
Do you know where he is?

03:58.655 --> 04:02.283
When the bombing started,
he fled to Hillah.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.369
Hillah, huh?

04:06.830 --> 04:09.081
Yes, that is right.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.589
Welcome to Hillah.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.942
Where's Jack?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.945
Why?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.789
There. See?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.628
Go back. I'll deal with this.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.922
What?

04:58.006 --> 05:02.343
Go back, Ana Lucia.
And don't tell anyone what you saw.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.378
What are you doing here, Danielle?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.590
Looking for you.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.777
Where are we going?

06:02.654 --> 06:05.781
You said you were looking for me.
What was your plan?

06:05.866 --> 06:09.243
To hide in the woods,
hoping I would pass you by?

06:09.327 --> 06:12.538
I was going to wait until dark,
and then find you at your tent.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.623
Why?

06:17.461 --> 06:21.047
- We need to keep moving.
- Tell me where we are moving to.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.466
Trust me.

06:23.550 --> 06:28.220
The last time we met, you warned us the
Others were coming, which they weren't.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.682
In fact, it was a diversion
to kidnap Claire's baby.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.518
So pardon me for not trusting you.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.148
This place I am taking you to,

06:39.232 --> 06:43.277
there is something that will help you,
something important.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.700
As for trust,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.830
take this.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.007
If I'm lying, it's yours to use.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.349
How much further?

07:14.476 --> 07:16.018
Not far.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.731
Ask him where he took the pilot.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.538
He says he does not know.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.208
We know for a fact he interrogated
the pilot day before yesterday.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.293
Hell, probably in this room.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.297
Tell him,

07:45.382 --> 07:48.467
we get our man back safe and sound,
he goes free.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.164
What's he saying?

08:18.248 --> 08:20.457
He says he does not know.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.921
I was born,
but I wasn't born yesterday, son.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.091
You don't help me out here,
someone else will take over,

08:29.176 --> 08:34.513
and that someone,
he won't play nice at all.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.020
I am sorry. He does not know.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.275
OK. You had your chance.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.445
Guards.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.490
Lock him back up.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.055
This is unbelievable.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.900
Hey. Hey, you hear that thing?

09:27.984 --> 09:30.361
You hear that frog? Frog?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.406
You wanna help me find it?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.286
What? We ain't friends anymore?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.986
- What you got there, Rerun?
- Nothing.

10:14.864 --> 10:19.243
Yeah, well, you got a spot of nothing
on your chin there.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.374
Dharma Initiative Ranch Dressing?

10:26.418 --> 10:30.296
You're supposed to refrigerate that
after you open it.

10:30.380 --> 10:35.050
On the back it says it'll keep at room
temperature for up to seven years.

10:38.513 --> 10:42.474
Well, well.
Looky who's got a secret stash.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.727
Please, dude. You can't tell.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.271
What? That you stole food
from the group?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.817
Now, why would I wanna do that?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.902
Come on, man. Please.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.698
Son of a bitch.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.120
- Dude, it's just a tree frog.
- Have you seen it?

11:03.204 --> 11:04.330
Yeah.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.668
Tell you what,
you help me find that thing,

11:09.753 --> 11:13.005
you can keep right on Ranch dipping.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.090
We got a deal?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.178
How much further?

11:20.430 --> 11:22.723
- Danielle?
- We're here.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.517
And where exactly is "here?"

11:29.105 --> 11:31.315
What is that for, Danielle?

11:31.399 --> 11:33.442
Help me!

11:33.526 --> 11:36.779
Hey! Over here!

11:40.241 --> 11:41.867
Wait.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.411
- Help!
- Sayid, listen to me.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.790
Hey! Hey!

11:47.874 --> 11:50.167
Over here!

11:50.251 --> 11:53.462
Please! Help me!

11:55.548 --> 11:58.842
- Help me!
- Don't believe a word he says.

11:58.927 --> 12:02.346
- Hey!
- He's one of them.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.225
I have no idea what she's talking about.
She's crazy.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.894
- How long has he been up there?
- Since last night.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.356
Please just cut me down.
My name is Henry Gale.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.441
I'm from Minnesota.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.780
- Please.
- He's lying.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.370
- I'm going to cut him down.
- Don't.

12:27.622 --> 12:31.041
- Thank you.
- You're making a serious mistake.

12:35.296 --> 12:39.383
It's OK. It's OK.
You're all right. You're all right.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.971
Hold on.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.307
Take it easy.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.229
- No.
- Wait.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.648
Danielle, don't.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.839
You could have killed him.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.592
If I wanted to kill him,
I would have killed him.

13:23.803 --> 13:29.266
- You shot this man with no provocation.
- He is one of them.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.310
Tie him up.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.647
You should take him to your doctor.
He's no good to you dead.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.317
And then what?

13:38.401 --> 13:40.903
You'll talk to him, Sayid.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.989
As I recall, that is what you do.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.245
But know this: he will lie.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.541
For a long time, he will lie.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.835
I wanna talk to you
about your buddy, Tariq.

14:41.965 --> 14:46.885
Look, I get it.
You're a man who values loyalty.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.096
Even doing a little translating for us,

14:49.180 --> 14:51.932
you feel like
you're doing the wrong thing.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.227
I get that, and I respect it.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.400
This is what Tariq was doing

15:01.484 --> 15:05.737
before he took over command
of your intelligence unit.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.491
He was the head of a chemical warfare
battalion in the north.

15:09.576 --> 15:13.203
Personally supervised
the use of sarin gas on this village.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.381
You recognize it, don't you?

15:25.300 --> 15:28.135
You had relatives in that village
didn't you, Sayid?

15:32.974 --> 15:35.517
So, you know what sarin gas does.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.230
No discrimination.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.274
The entire marketplace.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.444
Innocent women, children.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.785
Enough.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.871
Please.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.878
Loyalty is a virtue.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.173
But unquestioning loyalty...

16:07.634 --> 16:09.968
I don't think that's you.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.598
Why should I believe you?

16:15.850 --> 16:18.935
How do you think we knew
you had relatives in that village?

16:19.020 --> 16:23.315
We liberated your personnel file
and Tariq's.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.156
All we want is our pilot back,

16:31.240 --> 16:34.409
so we can send him home to his family.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.957
Tariq will never talk to you.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.253
That's why you're gonna have
to make him talk to you.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.223
John. John, wake up.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.272
- What?
- Come out here.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.076
Minnesota, huh?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.747
That's the question, isn't it?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.715
Where am I?

17:29.799 --> 17:32.926
- Who are you?
- Henry. Henry Gale.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.011
Ah, my back.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.016
We're going to take it out,
but first I want you to relax.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.645
How did you get to this island?

17:43.730 --> 17:47.232
Four months ago.
We crashed, my wife and I.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.317
Crashed in what?

17:49.402 --> 17:53.613
A balloon.
We were trying to cross the Pacific.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.827
Your wife, where is she?

18:00.329 --> 18:03.331
She died. She got...

18:04.584 --> 18:07.252
She got sick, three weeks ago.

18:08.880 --> 18:13.842
We were staying in a cave off the beach.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.344
My shoulder.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.222
At least untie my arms.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.808
What the hell's going on here?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.771
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.

18:27.023 --> 18:31.610
- She believes he's an Other.
- Another what?

18:31.694 --> 18:34.654
- You shot him with an arrow?
- Do I have a bow?

18:35.865 --> 18:38.700
Hey, hey. You with me?

18:40.286 --> 18:44.915
- You were gonna let him bleed to death?
- I was trying to get honest answers.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.919
And his wound
is far from life-threatening.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.464
We should let Jack treat him first.
Then we'll get our answers.

18:52.548 --> 18:56.051
Jack. Do not untie him.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.983
This is how people get killed
in scary movies.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.904
If this were a scary movie, I'd be
with a hot chick, not you, Barbar.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.660
- It's Babar.
- Why don't you shut up, Hammo?

19:21.744 --> 19:27.207
Or your Ranch disorder's gonna be the
new lead item on the coconut Internet.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.085
Fine. Go ahead.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.089
Tell everyone the fat guy's
been hiding Ranch dressing.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.633
The fat guy likes to eat.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.344
Yeah, I'm fat.

19:39.428 --> 19:43.849
Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.
You think I don't know that?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.351
At least people like me.

19:49.063 --> 19:52.065
Well, find the damn frog by yourself.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.777
Hurley, wait. Wait. Hey, Hurley.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.657
Look, man, I'm sorry. All right?

20:01.951 --> 20:05.912
But this frog is killing me.
You gotta help me out.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.539
Please.

20:45.119 --> 20:48.496
- So, what do you think?
- What do you think, John?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.751
I think he's pretty convincing.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.297
Yes, he is.

20:58.507 --> 21:02.135
The problem is, there's no way
we can be sure he's telling the truth.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.182
That is not necessarily true.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.938
Does Jack have the combination
to the armory?

21:15.274 --> 21:18.151
For now he does.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.488
How long would it take
for you to change it?

21:32.041 --> 21:36.294
If you're angry,
looking for someone to punish...

21:36.379 --> 21:39.631
Why would I need to punish anyone?

21:45.054 --> 21:48.098
I want to find out who he is.

21:48.182 --> 21:51.267
I want the truth.

21:51.352 --> 21:56.064
We both know that Jack will have issues
with what must be done to get it.

22:01.946 --> 22:06.282
So, how long, John,
to change the combination?

22:06.367 --> 22:08.785
Couple of minutes, tops.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.956
Then I suggest you get started.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.638
- Did he say anything while...
- No, he didn't.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.225
He was in shock.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.522
We can't just leave him
laying here, Jack.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.025
People will see him.
It'll create a panic.

22:40.109 --> 22:43.903
- Where do you think we should put him?
- I say we put him in the armory.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.322
It's secure.

22:46.407 --> 22:50.285
Better to err on the side of safety,
Jack, at least until we can be sure.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.835
OK.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.920
For now.

23:28.324 --> 23:32.577
We can pull that cot in here.
He shouldn't be on his back.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.662
Good idea.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.006
Sayid.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.052
Hey. What the hell are you doing? Sayid.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.388
- What needs to be done.
- Hey.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.394
The pilot was executed two days ago.

26:03.479 --> 26:07.732
He is buried in a field
four kilometers from here.

26:07.816 --> 26:10.151
I can take you there.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.423
Damn it. Sayid, open the door.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.010
- Sayid, answer me.
- Jack.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.890
Why isn't this combination
working, John?

26:42.017 --> 26:44.269
Did you change it?

26:44.353 --> 26:46.187
Yeah.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.608
Why would you do that?

26:50.693 --> 26:54.445
- You're raising an army.
- What?

26:54.530 --> 26:56.614
Why you didn't ask me is your business.

26:56.699 --> 27:01.244
But there's only one reason to raise an
army, and that's because we're at war.

27:02.788 --> 27:06.332
And like it or not, whatever Sayid
has to do behind that door,

27:06.417 --> 27:08.251
that's a part of it, too.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.630
What if he's telling the truth, John?

27:13.799 --> 27:16.259
What if he's not?

27:27.813 --> 27:29.897
Get up.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.277
What's happening?

27:35.571 --> 27:37.572
Here. Let me help you.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.415
You said you've been here
for four months.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.833
What?

27:48.917 --> 27:52.045
You said you came to this island
four months ago, yes?

27:52.129 --> 27:53.629
Where am I?

27:55.215 --> 27:58.509
Please. Answer my question.

27:58.594 --> 28:02.805
Yeah, yes. We landed four months ago.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.641
Maybe more. Who are you?

28:05.726 --> 28:07.727
You were in a cave for all that time?

28:07.811 --> 28:10.021
Off the beach.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.983
- On the north shore of the island.
- How far from where you were captured?

28:14.068 --> 28:16.027
- I don't know.
- How many days walk?

28:16.111 --> 28:19.655
- Two. Two days.
- Why did you stay on the beach so long?

28:19.740 --> 28:21.741
Why wouldn't we?

28:22.534 --> 28:25.244
We wanted to be there for flyovers.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.830
We had an emergency beacon,
a transmitter.

28:27.915 --> 28:31.084
- What kind of transmitter?
- An ADF beacon.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.670
We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted.

28:38.467 --> 28:42.512
Look, whatever you think I am, I'm not.

28:43.931 --> 28:48.309
Please, please, just tell me your name.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.520
Your wife. What is her maiden name?

28:50.604 --> 28:53.231
- Murphy.
- Where did you meet her?

28:53.315 --> 28:56.234
- University of Minnesota.
- How did she die?

28:56.318 --> 28:58.319
She got sick.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.656
She got sick?

29:03.826 --> 29:06.327
It started as a fever.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.914
After two days, she was delirious.

29:12.126 --> 29:14.127
Then she died.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.931
I don't know why
you're asking these questions.

29:27.015 --> 29:31.394
I don't know why
you're treating me this way,

29:31.478 --> 29:33.938
why I have to explain to you who I am

29:34.022 --> 29:36.399
when you don't tell me who you are.

29:36.483 --> 29:40.027
I was 23 years old when the Americans
came to my country.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.824
I was a good man. I was a soldier.

29:46.368 --> 29:50.955
And when they left,
I was something different.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.375
For the next six years

29:54.460 --> 29:57.086
I did things I wish I could erase
from my memory,

29:57.171 --> 30:00.715
things which I never thought myself
to be capable of.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.761
But I did come to learn this.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.475
There is a part of me
which was always capable.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.980
You want to know who I am.

30:19.443 --> 30:23.321
My name is Sayid Jarrah,

30:23.405 --> 30:25.740
and I am a torturer.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.089
Where is it?

30:42.174 --> 30:44.175
There it is.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.729
Gotcha.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.148
Dude, nice catch.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.484
Well, I'll be damned.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.070
All that noise from this tiny critter.

31:05.280 --> 31:09.867
Kind of reminds me of a turtle
I once had. His name was Stewart.

31:09.952 --> 31:12.203
He ran off when I was ten.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.039
Well, that's what Mom said.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.124
I kind of think she threw him out.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.174
Wow, you're a happy little fellow,
ain't you?

31:31.306 --> 31:34.183
I have an idea.

31:34.268 --> 31:37.270
Why don't I take him far from here?

31:38.313 --> 31:43.150
Two beaches away.
Maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog.

31:43.235 --> 31:47.154
That way he won't keep you up anymore
and everyone's happy.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.451
Yeah, that's one idea.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.080
Here's another.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.210
Dude.

32:02.838 --> 32:06.382
I hear with a little Ranch
they taste just like chicken.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.828
Give you a hand?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.129
- Jack, I know this isn't...
- Shut up.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.396
Where are the pliers?

33:04.191 --> 33:06.525
Tell me about this balloon.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.655
- What?
- This balloon that brought you here.

33:10.739 --> 33:14.283
- Tell me about it.
- What do you wanna know?

33:15.118 --> 33:17.119
Everything.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.335
She's 140 feet high, 60 feet wide.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.007
And when she's up in the air,
550,000 cubic feet of helium

33:30.092 --> 33:32.468
and 100,000 of hot air keep her up.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.681
And if you could look down on her,

33:36.765 --> 33:41.018
you'd see
a big yellow smiley face on top.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.064
Why would you travel in that way?

33:47.859 --> 33:53.656
Because I was rich.
Because it was my dream.

33:57.202 --> 34:00.162
And Jennifer thought it would be neat.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.832
You were rich.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.382
I guess I'm thinking of things
in the past tense now.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.969
How's that for optimism?

34:15.053 --> 34:17.972
What did you do to become so rich?

34:19.599 --> 34:22.393
- I sold my company.
- What kind of company?

34:22.476 --> 34:24.520
- Mining.
- What did you mine?

34:25.938 --> 34:28.232
We mined nonmetallic minerals.

34:31.319 --> 34:34.237
Everyone wanted to talk to me
at cocktail parties.

34:42.496 --> 34:47.752
Give me your hands.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.510
- Where is she buried?
- What?

34:56.594 --> 34:58.429
Listen to me.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.182
You said you buried your wife.
Tell me where.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.434
- What are you...
- Where?

35:03.518 --> 35:08.105
In the jungle.
By the balloon. In the jungle.

35:08.190 --> 35:11.484
How deep?
How deep did you dig the grave?

35:11.568 --> 35:15.571
- I don't...
- How many shovelfuls of earth?

35:15.655 --> 35:18.365
Did you use your hands?
How long did it take you?

35:18.450 --> 35:21.535
- I don't remember.
- You would remember.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.621
You would remember how deep.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.749
You would remember
every shovelful, every moment.

35:27.459 --> 35:31.420
You would remember what it felt like
to place her body inside.

35:32.506 --> 35:36.008
You would remember
if you buried the woman you loved.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.805
You would remember if it were true.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.977
Did you lose someone?

35:48.271 --> 35:52.441
Did you lose someone here on the island?
Did you lose someone, too?

35:52.526 --> 35:54.485
What happened to her?

35:59.407 --> 36:03.327
It was an accident. It was an accident.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.997
The woman responsible
thought she was someone else,

36:07.082 --> 36:11.836
someone coming to hurt her,
someone like you.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.797
Just... This is all a mistake.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.341
Slow down here, OK?

36:17.425 --> 36:21.470
- Hurting me isn't gonna bring her back.
- You know what I lost.

36:21.555 --> 36:24.473
- Tell me the truth.
- No, stop.

36:24.558 --> 36:28.978
- Tell me who you are.
- No, no, no. Help. Stop.

36:29.062 --> 36:32.106
Tell me the truth. Tell me who you are.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.941
Stop, please.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.318
- Sayid.
- I've told you everything.

36:36.403 --> 36:37.945
- Sayid.
- Jack.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.031
- Tell me what I already know.
- Open it.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.409
- Open it now, John.
- This has to happen.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.663
You open that damn door,
you understand me? You open it now.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.999
- No.
- Now.

36:54.462 --> 36:57.882
- You're lying.
- What do you want me to say?

36:57.966 --> 37:01.385
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.
Just, please...

37:02.804 --> 37:04.680
I want you to tell me the truth.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.557
Open the door.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.353
- Let go of me, Jack.
- Or what? Wanna push the button?

37:11.438 --> 37:14.565
Open the door.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.155
It's under a minute now.
You better think fast.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.241
- You wouldn't.
- What? I wouldn't what?

37:24.326 --> 37:27.661
If we don't...
You would risk everyone's lives?

37:27.746 --> 37:32.249
You talked me into pushing that button
once, John, but it's yours now.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.418
You're the one who won't risk it. You.

37:34.502 --> 37:37.379
I don't think anything'll happen
when we get to zero.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.089
- Jack.
- You wanna see?

37:39.174 --> 37:42.092
Let's just see what's gonna happen.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.846
Who are you? Who are you?
Who are you?

37:51.478 --> 37:54.104
OK, OK, OK. Right 15, left...

37:54.189 --> 37:56.690
You think I'm stupid? You open it.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.584
Hey, hey.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.651
- He's lying.
- Not like this.

38:40.735 --> 38:45.698
- I'll tell you whatever you want.
- He's lying. He's lying.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.783
That's enough.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.634
What the hell was that?

39:05.719 --> 39:10.472
- He is one of them.
- Yeah? Did he tell you that?

39:10.557 --> 39:13.058
- No.
- Then how do you know?

39:14.436 --> 39:18.647
Because I know. He is one of them.

39:21.109 --> 39:24.361
I think that's what Rousseau thought
about you once, Sayid.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.822
She strapped you down, she shocked you,

39:26.906 --> 39:30.034
all because she thought
you were one of them.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.244
He is.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.372
- What?
- He is one of them.

39:35.457 --> 39:39.460
To Rousseau, we're all Others.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.380
I guess it's all relative, huh?

40:14.704 --> 40:17.206
You got a wife? Kids?

40:36.518 --> 40:40.938
Come on down. Hurry up.
Get out. Get out. Stop there.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.273
Get over here. Keep your eyes peeled.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.404
I'll take him.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.454
It's over. We're pulling out,
not going to Baghdad.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.083
Your man Saddam gets to stay in power,

41:01.167 --> 41:05.796
which means you, in all likelihood,
will remain in his employ.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.341
I guess you're lucky
you have a new skill set you can use.

41:10.885 --> 41:15.514
What you made me do, no human being
should ever have to do to another.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.783
I will never do that again.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.288
Yeah.

41:42.876 --> 41:46.044
Good luck to you, Sayid.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.756
Bus fare back to Ramadi.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.301
Let's move out.

42:15.825 --> 42:18.493
There is a man down in the hatch.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.539
A stranger captured by Rousseau.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.752
I beat him.

42:28.588 --> 42:30.589
I beat him badly.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.679
Why are you telling me this, Sayid?

42:40.016 --> 42:42.392
Jack asked me how I knew,

42:42.477 --> 42:45.270
knew for sure that this man was lying,

42:45.980 --> 42:51.235
how I knew for sure that he was
one of them, one of the Others.

42:52.528 --> 42:55.948
I know because I feel no guilt
for what I did to him.

43:04.832 --> 43:09.878
But there is no way I can ever
explain that to Jack, or even Locke,

43:09.963 --> 43:12.339
because both of them have forgotten.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.050
Forgotten? What?

43:16.719 --> 43:19.930
That you were strung up by your neck
and left for dead.

43:20.014 --> 43:24.559
That Claire was kept for days during
which God knows what happened to her.

43:24.644 --> 43:28.480
That these people, these Others,

43:28.564 --> 43:30.857
are merciless

43:30.942 --> 43:33.944
and can take any one of us
whenever they choose.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.911
So, tell me, Charlie...

43:45.081 --> 43:47.082
...have you forgotten?
