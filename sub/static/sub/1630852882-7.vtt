08:05.068 --> 08:06.320
Joel.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.071
[sighs]

08:08.155 --> 08:10.866
♪ When I know for certain...

08:10.949 --> 08:12.409
[exhales] We're having a baby.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.036
Who is?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.329
Me and Mei.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.873
We're having a baby.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.291
Wow.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.293
Wow.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.961
Add a couple of hundred wows
for me.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.630
I assume it was a surprise?

08:24.713 --> 08:25.631
You could say that.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.466
Anything else?

08:30.344 --> 08:32.137
- So what's the plan?
- It's brand-new.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.889
- That's not a plan.
- We just found out.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.057
Again, not a plan.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.058
What do you want to know, Midge?

08:36.141 --> 08:37.142
The color of the nursery?

08:37.226 --> 08:38.143
Which college it's going to?

08:38.227 --> 08:40.145
I get to know something, Joel.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.022
This is gonna affect me
and the kids a lot.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.232
- I know.
- I mean,

08:43.315 --> 08:44.942
- what have you discussed?
- Nothing.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.319
She's not even here. She's
interviewing for her residency.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.404
- Out of town?
- Yeah.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.990
What happens if she lands
somewhere else? Do you move?

08:52.074 --> 08:53.450
I've got the club.
You know I can't move.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.701
Does she know that?

08:54.785 --> 08:56.286
You know,
I didn't have to tell you this.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.163
That my kids
are gonna have a stepmom?

08:58.247 --> 08:59.873
- Really?
I didn't need to know this?
- These are cold.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.291
I'd find out
when I run into the two of you

09:01.375 --> 09:02.501
pushing a stroller?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.503
You know, forget this.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.545
Forget we ever spoke.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.631
Joel, wait!

09:15.430 --> 09:17.099
You can't be mad at me
for asking questions.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.309
Those aren't questions. They're
the fucking third degree.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.271
I know nothing about this girl
except she's gonna be a doctor.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.939
- That's right.
- What kind of doctor?

09:24.022 --> 09:26.650
Foot doctor? Brain doctor?
Eye doctor? Kid doctor?

09:26.733 --> 09:27.943
Just a doctor doctor.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.486
You seem to know nothing
about this girl.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.321
Does she even have a last name?
Doctor what?

09:31.405 --> 09:33.240
- Lin.
- One "N" or two?

09:33.323 --> 09:34.283
One.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.701
You had to think about it?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.411
She'll change her name
to Maisel.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.870
So you're getting married?

09:38.954 --> 09:40.539
Would it kill you
to be happy for me?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.791
- You need to be happy first.
- I'm happy.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.419
Okay? I'm happy! This is happy!

09:45.502 --> 09:47.379
When are you telling
Moishe and Shirley?

09:47.462 --> 09:49.339
- How do you know I haven't?
- Because I was on the phone

09:49.423 --> 09:50.716
with Shirley
for half an hour last night,

09:50.799 --> 09:52.467
and the bulk of the conversation
was about instant yeast

09:52.551 --> 09:54.136
and that sexy Robert Goulet.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.679
They don't know yet.
So don't say anything.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.514
She may be showing
the next time they see her.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.016
They haven't met her yet.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.267
They hav...

10:00.350 --> 10:01.893
Do you have a handle on this?

10:01.977 --> 10:02.978
At all?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.438
God,

10:04.521 --> 10:06.565
Joel, what have
you gotten yourself into?

10:06.648 --> 10:08.608
I want to get off this street.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.652
Are you really getting married?

10:11.695 --> 10:14.197
She and I are gonna work out the
logistics when she gets back.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.699
I will keep you in the loop.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.659
And prospective parents
tend to get married.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.620
- Okay.
- Don't mention this to anyone
till I say you can.

10:20.704 --> 10:21.872
Yes, sir.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.540
That wasn't a command.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.001
I'll see you later.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.502
And I'll talk to Pop
about the costumes.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.254
[clang]

10:36.136 --> 10:37.220
- Abe?
- [panting]

10:37.304 --> 10:38.847
Away from the door.
Away from the door.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.682
- Why?
- Is that back door locked?

10:40.766 --> 10:42.768
Yes. What's wrong?
You're sweating.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.978
Quiet. Whisper.
Mime it if you can.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.897
- Abe.
- The little one, Rose.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.398
- The little one.
- What little one?

10:48.482 --> 10:50.609
The tiny Jewish one.
Moloch in pearls.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.404
The big one.
Irish, with hands that crush.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.655
They were in the store.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.656
What store?

10:56.740 --> 10:57.908
My tobacco store.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.910
Apparently, you're a matchmaker?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.536
Abe, I've been a matchmaker
all these months.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.746
You knew that.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.122
Well, they're matchmakers, too.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.375
And they want you to stop.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.877
That's what they said.
In no uncertain terms

11:08.960 --> 11:10.796
and intimidating accents.

11:10.879 --> 11:11.922
Stop.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.507
Your coat is ripped.
Did they hurt you?

11:13.590 --> 11:18.387
No. But I was afraid they
would follow me from the store,

11:18.470 --> 11:20.806
so I did everything I could
to shake them.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.517
I serpentined my way
through streets,

11:23.600 --> 11:25.310
ran into random shops,

11:25.394 --> 11:27.437
- dove between cars.
- Oh, my God.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.814
Then I...

11:30.982 --> 11:32.025
Abe?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.151
I...

11:33.235 --> 11:35.195
- You what?
- [bell tolling]

11:35.278 --> 11:37.406
[Abe] I ducked
into a Catholic church,

11:37.489 --> 11:39.032
thinking sanctuary,

11:39.116 --> 11:41.034
at least from the Irish one.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.869
I thought it would be empty,

11:42.953 --> 11:44.538
but they were in the middle
of mass.

11:44.621 --> 11:49.042
The only sound in the room
was this windy pipe organ.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.336
[organ playing]

11:51.420 --> 11:54.089
There was a long line of people
headed up the aisle,

11:54.172 --> 11:56.550
so I joined it.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.343
I had no idea what it was for.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.804
I just moved along with it.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.180
Blend in--

12:02.264 --> 12:04.307
that was the strategy.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.518
When I got to the front,

12:06.601 --> 12:08.603
everyone was kneeling.

12:08.687 --> 12:11.064
So I knelt, too.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.234
That's when I saw him.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.653
He was holding this silver cup.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.823
And in order
not to look suspicious...

12:19.906 --> 12:21.074
Abe,

12:21.158 --> 12:23.034
- you didn't.
- I took communion.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.953
- Oh, my God.
- I think the priest

12:25.036 --> 12:26.037
was suspicious.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.457
Especially when he said,
"The body of Christ"

12:28.540 --> 12:29.958
and I answered, "Mazel tov."

12:30.041 --> 12:30.959
My head is spinning.

12:31.042 --> 12:31.960
So, there I was,

12:32.043 --> 12:33.378
with a mouthful of Christ,

12:33.462 --> 12:35.422
wondering what the hell to do.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.008
I left immediately
and took it out.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.510
And now...

12:40.594 --> 12:42.471
what do I do with it?

12:42.554 --> 12:44.306
Wrap it up in something.
Set it aside.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.516
- We've got bigger worries.
- They mentioned Miriam

12:46.600 --> 12:48.643
and the grandchildren by name.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.563
Go clean up.
We will figure this out.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.613
I really appreciate you coming
to this showcase yourself

12:59.696 --> 13:01.364
and not just sending
an associate.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.533
You won't be sorry.
Alfie's the best.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.701
- [knocking]
- Don't come in!

13:04.784 --> 13:06.328
I said don't come in.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.537
Midge Maisel is here.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.080
[quietly] Now? She's early.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.875
Uh, so I'll see you
Friday night, Mr. Glatter.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.543
Thank you. Tell Midge to wait.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.544
I'm here.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.545
I need her to wait!

13:15.629 --> 13:17.172
- Could you step outside?
- Really?

13:17.255 --> 13:19.216
She's already in. Let her stay.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.635
- [crying]
- Why is she crying?

13:21.718 --> 13:22.969
Why are you here?

13:23.053 --> 13:24.638
- We had an appointment.
- At 1:00.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.390
No, at 11:00, and it's noon,
so I'm an hour late.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.935
I told her 11:00 so she'd be
here at noon! You said,

13:30.018 --> 13:32.020
"That fucking Miriam, she's
always an hour fucking late

13:32.103 --> 13:33.939
because she doesn't give a shit
about anyone but herself!"

13:34.022 --> 13:36.149
Thank you!
And I didn't say that!

13:36.233 --> 13:37.984
Well, you're here. Sit.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.820
Because I actually have a happy
piece of news to share with you.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.572
Happy news. I'm all ears.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.990
Took a lot of string-pulling,

13:44.074 --> 13:45.951
but you said
you wanted a headlining gig.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.452
I got you a headlining gig.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.453
Are you kidding?

13:48.537 --> 13:49.704
Thousand-seat theater.

13:49.788 --> 13:50.830
Good pay, too.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.249
Amazing. Where's the gig?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.416
Croatia.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.085
Where is that, Pennsylvania?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.420
The Republic of Croatia.
That's where the gig is.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.756
The name of the place
is in their language,

13:59.839 --> 14:03.843
which loosely translates
as "Make Laugh Showing Teeth."

14:03.927 --> 14:04.844
Croatia?

14:04.928 --> 14:06.638
Uh, specifically Zagreb.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.764
I think that's the capital.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.849
- [Dinah] It is!
- Thank you!

14:09.933 --> 14:11.476
It's a five-night stand,

14:11.560 --> 14:13.979
but the place only turns on its
electricity one night a week.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.564
So you would fly in
for that one night,

14:15.647 --> 14:17.649
do the gig, then fly back.
Then you wait six days

14:17.732 --> 14:19.651
and you fly back into Zagreb,
do another gig,

14:19.734 --> 14:21.319
- and then fly back.
- For five straight weeks?

14:21.403 --> 14:22.904
Now, you're gonna need shots.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.864
Uh, smallpox, tetanus,
diphtheria.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.950
Apparently
it's excruciatingly painful,

14:27.033 --> 14:28.577
so you want to get 'em
about a week before you go.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.787
Susie, I can't do all
that traveling back and forth

14:30.870 --> 14:32.747
to a far-off country
for one show a week.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.915
I'll drop dead.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.083
No, not if you get your shots.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.085
Pass.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.422
You said, "Make me a headliner."

14:40.505 --> 14:41.923
In the Western Hemisphere.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.217
- So it's a no.
- It's a million noes.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.428
So you'll warm up for Sophie
Lennon, but you won't take this?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.680
That was a mistake
that I won't make again.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.432
You know, I don't think
I can do better than this.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.434
Do you understand?
I mean, just last week,

14:52.517 --> 14:54.436
I had a pretty big guy
angling to check you out.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.104
I didn't even have a place
to send him to see you.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.105
Who?

14:57.188 --> 14:58.356
You ever heard of Gordon Ford?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.442
Really?
Gordon Ford would come see me?

15:00.525 --> 15:01.610
Yes. Well, no, not him.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.069
He's too big. But his booker.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.614
His booker? Well, that's
still pretty big, his booker.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.866
...'s intern.
His booker's intern.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.160
But he was really into it.
And he reports to the booker,

15:10.243 --> 15:11.786
and the booker reports
to Gordon Ford.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.580
Fine. If they really want to see
me, they can always come over...

15:13.663 --> 15:15.123
Before you finish
that goddamn sentence,

15:15.206 --> 15:18.460
these guys cannot come to an
illegal strip club to see you.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.919
They're too legit.
They can't be seen there,

15:20.003 --> 15:21.421
so they just won't do it.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.174
And there is no local
headlining gig for you.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.717
Not in the near future.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.136
I am working on it,
but let's be realistic.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.721
- I'm going to lunch.
- Good.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.181
Go. Take a handkerchief.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.933
- What's the matter with her?
- [sighs]

15:34.017 --> 15:37.103
Long story. Just don't make
friends, 'cause she's got to go.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.355
Oh. Poor thing.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.398
She's not professional,
you know?

15:40.482 --> 15:41.816
She's got these boyfriends
she's always fighting with,

15:41.900 --> 15:44.319
and her tiny family's
always running around.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.155
Too much drama,
too much trouble. A lot of snot.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.074
Well, I was gonna get the Alfie
showcase info from her.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.450
I'm bringing four with me.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.785
Just grab a flyer.
It's underneath that pile.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.953
- Which one?
- The one on the right.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.872
Not that one. Next to it.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.207
The other next to it.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.167
You glued to your seat
or something? Show me.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.753
- It's right there.
- Why aren't you standing?

16:03.046 --> 16:04.130
Susie?

16:04.214 --> 16:06.383
I'm not wearing pants.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.884
Really?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.594
No, I just thought I'd do
some light comedy for you.

16:09.678 --> 16:10.845
Yes, really.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.555
Well, so what?
I've seen you in your boxers.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.890
Um...

16:13.973 --> 16:16.142
I'm not wearing boxers.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.477
You're just...

16:17.560 --> 16:19.270
- naked down there?
- Yes.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.689
Don't you stick to the seat?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.190
It wasn't a choice.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.067
The phone rang,
Dinah wasn't in yet,

16:24.150 --> 16:25.402
and I wasn't done dressing.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.904
- But...
- Get all your questions
out now!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.699
You dress yourself completely
on the top, then do the bottom?

16:30.782 --> 16:31.825
- [phone ringing]
- Yes.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.660
And not, like,
start with underwear

16:33.743 --> 16:35.704
on top and bottom
and then move on to outerwear?

16:35.787 --> 16:38.289
- No.
- Susie Myerson and Associates.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.791
May I ask who's calling?

16:39.874 --> 16:41.000
Who is it, Nicky?

16:42.043 --> 16:44.879
It's Sandy Bishop
at McCormick/Hatlestad.

16:44.963 --> 16:45.964
Oh, hi, Midge.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.799
I have to take this.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.093
Submit the rest of
your questions in writing, okay?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.886
- I'll talk to you later.
- Close the door

16:51.970 --> 16:52.929
on your way out.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.973
Hey! Miriam!

16:55.056 --> 16:57.183
- Mr. Bishop, hello.
- Midge. Long time no see.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.269
Hi, Frank. You guys helping out?

16:59.352 --> 17:01.146
- Whenever we can.
- Yeah, we hooked her up

17:01.229 --> 17:02.647
- with this place, you know.
- I know.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.566
And she's very happy here.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.443
So, uh, you taking
the Croatia gig?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.610
At Make Laugh Showing Teeth.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.154
- Uh, no.
- [Nicky] Really?

17:09.237 --> 17:11.614
- It's a thousand-seater.
Headliner.
- With electricity.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.158
I can't take it
for many reasons,

17:13.241 --> 17:15.118
but, for one, I can't leave
the kids that long.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.495
Ah. So it's a family thing.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.580
Mainly.

17:18.663 --> 17:23.001
Okay. "Not taking
due to family."

17:23.084 --> 17:24.085
You keeping track?

17:24.169 --> 17:26.671
Well, you're part
of our family now, right?

17:26.755 --> 17:30.216
Oh. Sure. I mean, my immediate
family's growing by the second,

17:30.300 --> 17:32.010
- so why not?
- Miriam,

17:32.093 --> 17:35.138
unless I'm mistaken,

17:35.221 --> 17:36.723
are you expecting?

17:36.806 --> 17:38.600
You're glowin'
but you're not showin'.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.895
No. My husband
and his mysterious girlfriend

17:41.978 --> 17:43.396
are expecting, and... [inhales]

17:43.480 --> 17:44.814
it's gonna be complicated.

17:44.898 --> 17:45.899
Mysterious, huh?

17:45.982 --> 17:47.066
He hardly knows her.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.318
Mm. Worrisome.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403
[Susie] At Cherry Lane.
Part of the Village.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.739
Midge,

17:52.822 --> 17:54.240
you worried about this girl?

17:54.324 --> 17:55.366
No.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.701
I mean...

17:56.785 --> 17:57.952
maybe a little.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.287
She's gonna be stepmother
to your children.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.955
And play an important role
in their upbringing.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.207
Joel didn't want to hear that.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.416
Mm-hmm.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.627
Anything else?

18:07.045 --> 18:08.671
Uh...

18:09.672 --> 18:11.216
Guess not.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.426
You want us
to look into this girl?

18:13.510 --> 18:15.136
No. No, no.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.137
Could you?

18:16.221 --> 18:17.180
- We could.
- Discreetly.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.181
Or not.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.016
No, I'd want it to be discreet.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.351
If I wanted it.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.685
Well, you're talking
to the right guys.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.229
We're good at getting
information out of people.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.480
- About people.
- About people.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.564
Without them knowing.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.650
Okay.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.069
Want to give us a name?

18:31.152 --> 18:32.987
I mean, she
probably just goes to school,

18:33.071 --> 18:35.114
- goes home...
- Maybe.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.450
Maybe not.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.788
And all you need's a name?

18:43.039 --> 18:45.166
And we will be very discreet.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.673
- [wind blowing]
- [cheering]

18:51.756 --> 18:53.132
[Aunt Em] Quick! Dorothy!

18:53.216 --> 18:55.301
Run for the cellar!

18:55.385 --> 18:58.137
[cheering]

18:58.221 --> 18:59.931
[cow moos]

19:00.932 --> 19:03.393
[cackling]

19:03.476 --> 19:04.602
[Toto barking]

19:04.686 --> 19:06.521
She told Boise right
to his face--

19:06.604 --> 19:08.857
Boise runs the place--
"You knock first."

19:08.940 --> 19:11.359
"Girls have knockers. Men
knock." That's what she said.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.736
Midge has always been
quietly assertive.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.196
One of the many reasons
why I love her.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.866
I worked a place in Philly once.
Had to put a sign on the door.

19:17.949 --> 19:18.867
"No BJs."

19:18.950 --> 19:20.910
[laughing]

19:20.994 --> 19:22.453
So funny. [inhales]

19:22.537 --> 19:23.663
What's a BJ?

19:23.746 --> 19:26.249
God, honey,
you are so sweet and innocent.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.084
Like an elf
riding a bunny rabbit.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.044
Well, I love this.
Sitting around, chatting,

19:30.128 --> 19:31.337
just us working girls.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.797
Oh, you work, sweetie?
What do you do?

19:32.881 --> 19:33.965
Something with ice skates,
right?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.258
No, I can't skate.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.176
I'm a mom. Plus I'm halfway
through my studies

19:37.260 --> 19:39.012
at the Katharine Gibbs
Secretarial School.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.181
- Secretarial school?
- Oh, I'd never want
to be a secretary.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.725
Men don't respect 'em.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.935
They spend all day at the office
just staring at their tits.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.104
- It's degrading.
- Right. Well,

19:48.187 --> 19:49.856
I would definitely avoid
having them do that.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.357
You really should learn
to skate.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.693
- What's up, party pooper?
- Just finished.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.778
With payday tomorrow,
I think I am just gonna make it

19:55.862 --> 19:57.572
- this month.
- Did I tell you Archie's sorry?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.157
- He feels so awful.
- I know.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.451
He put in an order to buy
56 pieces of Tupperware from me.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.453
It's ridiculous.
I'm not calling it in.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.371
He's Archie. He's trying to pay
you back whatever way he can.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.414
We'll get through it.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.790
Money comes, money goes.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.460
It mostly goes these days,
but que será.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.586
Everything okay?

20:11.669 --> 20:13.713
Yeah. We're just talking
about the big snatch.

20:13.796 --> 20:14.964
Who? Trixie?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.424
No. Imogene's husband

20:16.507 --> 20:18.134
got a bag snatched
off the street.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.302
Had some valuables in it.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.678
The valuables belonged
to my ex-husband,

20:20.762 --> 20:22.972
who now cannot make
his monthly payment.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.558
Oh, shoot, I forgot. I've got
a lead for you on a gig, Midge.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.393
- Hmm?
- You've heard
of John F. Kennedy?

20:27.477 --> 20:29.187
- Name rings a bell.
- My dad told me

20:29.270 --> 20:31.189
there's a big New York
fundraiser for him coming up.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.565
Wives For Kennedy.

20:32.649 --> 20:33.608
Jackie's throwing it.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.984
Jackie? Jackie Kennedy?

20:35.068 --> 20:36.778
Oh, my God. I want to be
her very best friend!

20:36.861 --> 20:38.404
She's John F. Kennedy's wife.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.989
- Her name rings a bell, too.
- They need a comedian.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.824
One that looks like a lady.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.993
It was Jackie's request.
A lady comedian.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.244
'Cause it's all ladies.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.038
- Does it pay?
- Who the hell cares?

20:47.121 --> 20:48.414
Kennedy. She'll do it!

20:48.498 --> 20:50.500
It pays.
You just can't say dirty stuff.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.501
She won't. She'll do it.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.086
I'll do it. Thanks, Gloria.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.545
I'll jot down the number
to call.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.839
[cheering in distance]

20:56.923 --> 20:58.424
So how's your dad involved
in this?

20:58.508 --> 20:59.717
Oh, he's a senator.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.761
- A senator?
- Yep.

21:01.844 --> 21:02.762
I don't get it.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.180
Are you not familiar

21:04.263 --> 21:06.391
with our bicameral system
of legislature?

21:06.474 --> 21:09.477
- No, I am.
- Because you didn't seem that
familiar with John F. Kennedy.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.771
Thanks for the tip, Gloria.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.940
Come on. Dorothy must be close
to throwing up by now.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.109
Hey, introduce me
to the Big Snatch.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.572
[indistinct chatter]

21:22.615 --> 21:24.283
This is gonna be a disaster.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.494
What are you talking about?
You got a great turnout.

21:26.577 --> 21:29.163
- The bigs showed up.
- Two of 'em bailed
at the last second.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.957
Two guys out of what, 20?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.500
You did Alfie proud.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.002
Yeah, well,
I can't showcase you in a place

21:34.085 --> 21:35.712
like this,
if that's what you're thinking.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.838
I gave you a compliment.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.548
There's no booze,
and the acoustics...

21:38.631 --> 21:39.924
they're not funny acoustics.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.342
No one would laugh.
You would die in this room.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.511
Whoa, slow down,
I wasn't implying anything,

21:43.594 --> 21:45.346
I was just saying
you got a good turnout.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.098
And I could kill
in an unfunny room.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.850
I should go check on Alfie.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.268
You should've seen me
in Grant's Tomb.

21:50.351 --> 21:53.187
I had the entire tenth grade
in stitches.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.023
It's bigger than I thought.

21:55.106 --> 21:58.026
And before I spat it out,
I was really enjoying the taste.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.777
And you want
to get it back to them?

21:59.861 --> 22:00.987
But how is the question.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.488
Well, maybe you should stop by
a mass,

22:02.572 --> 22:03.990
get in the communion line,
and when it's your turn,

22:04.073 --> 22:05.533
just toss it back in.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.326
They wouldn't be
suspicious of a Jew

22:07.410 --> 22:09.537
tiddlywinking a communion
wafer back in the cup?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.831
- They'd throw holy water on me.
- Then what, flush it?

22:11.914 --> 22:14.042
You're going to flush the body
of Christ down the toilet?

22:14.125 --> 22:15.960
The poor man's been
through enough...

22:16.044 --> 22:18.046
Guys, it's starting.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.215
[audience applauding]

22:24.218 --> 22:26.220
Hello. And welcome.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.806
So, right off,
a piece of good news.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.601
I'm not gonna bore you
with card tricks.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.561
You people toward the back,
you wouldn't be able

22:33.644 --> 22:35.396
to see much of what I was doing.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.148
Unless I came up
into the audience,

22:37.231 --> 22:40.109
and who wants to see me
come up into the audience?

22:40.193 --> 22:42.278
- [laughter]
- No.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.946
I'm gonna stay right here.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.365
And you'll stay there,
and this...

22:46.449 --> 22:48.117
[audience clamoring]

22:49.410 --> 22:51.913
...will not be part of the show.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.624
Now let's go forward.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.834
Into the past.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.755
[audience gasping]

23:00.838 --> 23:02.799
My ancestors, long ago.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.300
Having a laugh.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.676
[laughter]

23:05.760 --> 23:09.388
Me, in my homemade
superhero cape.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.808
You must be wondering
what my powers were.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.186
We'll get to that.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.607
On the Major Bowes
Amateur Hour,

23:19.690 --> 23:21.651
I won. Cute.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.985
[audience] Aw!

23:24.070 --> 23:26.906
This hasn't even happened yet.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.617
Perhaps it will,
perhaps it won't.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.661
My family. My cape.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.080
My break. My future...

23:34.163 --> 23:36.082
My God, Rose,

23:36.165 --> 23:37.875
that looks like you.

23:37.959 --> 23:40.086
No... does it?

23:40.169 --> 23:41.462
He is magic, you know.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.297
It says in the program.
Read the program.

23:43.381 --> 23:46.425
Will you go on this
journey with me?

23:46.509 --> 23:49.095
[audience applauding, clamoring]

23:49.178 --> 23:50.930
Good.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.557
'Cause I've locked
all the doors from the outside.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.933
You don't have a choice.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.227
[laughter]

23:56.310 --> 23:59.397
[audience applauding]

23:59.480 --> 24:01.149
Now is the time when I ask

24:01.232 --> 24:02.859
for a volunteer.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.610
- [gasps] Ooh.
- If you've raised your hand,

24:04.694 --> 24:06.487
- you're disqualified.
- [groans]

24:06.571 --> 24:08.197
Sorry, too eager.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.657
I knew I shouldn't have
raised my hand.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.409
I get overly excited,
and that pushes people away.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.994
Just sometimes.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.163
It's the reluctant
that I like to engage.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.165
The hidden figures.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.792
The unsung souls.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.628
The ones
with depth we cannot see.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.714
I...

24:24.797 --> 24:26.132
choose...

24:26.215 --> 24:27.550
you.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.135
[audience murmuring]

24:29.218 --> 24:30.845
Who's he pointing to?

24:30.928 --> 24:32.555
I believe he's pointing to you.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.849
Me? I can't go up there.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.851
- Why not?
- Mama, go on, come on, Mama.
- Get up there, Rose.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.561
- Come on, Mom!
- It'll be fun!

24:38.644 --> 24:40.563
If not me,
I'm so happy it's you, Rose.

24:40.646 --> 24:41.939
Let's give her
some encouragement,

24:42.023 --> 24:43.149
ladies and gentlemen.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.358
She has no idea

24:44.442 --> 24:45.818
what I'm going to do with her.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.446
Very good!

24:48.529 --> 24:50.781
Come right up next to me,
young lady.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.909
That's it.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.077
Now, what's your name?

24:55.161 --> 24:56.412
It's Rose.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.538
Rose.

24:57.622 --> 24:59.624
[Rose gasps]

25:00.750 --> 25:03.169
Thank God
your name wasn't Cactus.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.545
- [laughter]
- Good one!

25:04.629 --> 25:06.881
Tell me a little
about yourself, Rose.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.468
Oh, well,
I live on the Upper West Side.

25:10.551 --> 25:11.802
I'm happily married.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.596
I have two children,
three grandchildren.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.431
Sounds like a wonderful life.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.725
Do you like your grandchildren,
Rose?

25:17.808 --> 25:19.518
Of course I do.
What a thing to say.

25:19.602 --> 25:20.895
I adore them. They're perfect.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.897
- Are you sleepy?
- I'm sorry?

25:22.980 --> 25:24.649
And what are your
grandchildren's names?

25:24.732 --> 25:26.484
Ethan, Esther and Chaim.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.362
Wonderful,
I like the rhythm of that.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.656
Ethan.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.449
Esther...

25:33.532 --> 25:35.159
Chaim... It's warm in here.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.619
It's warm in here.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.246
Ethan.

25:38.329 --> 25:39.914
Esther.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.667
Chaim. Do you like
your grandchildren, Rose?

25:42.750 --> 25:45.086
They can be little terrors.
Their parents are too lenient.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.046
- Oh! Low blow.
- What a meanie.

25:47.129 --> 25:50.258
I think we have a slander
lawsuit on our hands, ladies.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.301
Ethan... Esther...

25:52.385 --> 25:54.387
Chaim.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.681
- Is she being hypnotized?
- I believe so.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.225
- And what about your children?
- They're in the audience.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.018
- Look out.
- Incoming.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.770
Tell me about your children.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.814
My son is brilliant.
A mathematician,

26:04.897 --> 26:06.440
like his father.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.109
- And your daughter?
- She's like you.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.069
An undiagnosed schizophrenic?

26:10.152 --> 26:11.195
[laughter]

26:11.279 --> 26:12.530
She's a performer.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.365
Fascinating.

26:14.448 --> 26:17.159
And which
of the grandkids are hers?

26:17.243 --> 26:18.911
Ethan.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.496
Esther...

26:20.579 --> 26:22.081
Chaim.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.499
Rose?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.210
Next time
you hear those names...

26:26.294 --> 26:27.837
I want you to show me...

26:27.920 --> 26:29.297
Show you?

26:29.380 --> 26:31.090
...what your daughter does.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.467
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

26:33.551 --> 26:34.635
- No.
- How?

26:34.719 --> 26:35.803
- What?
- [Alfie] Ethan...

26:35.886 --> 26:37.638
- What her daughter does?
- Esther...

26:37.722 --> 26:39.348
- What the hell?
- Chaim!

26:39.432 --> 26:41.892
Bubble, bubble,

26:41.976 --> 26:43.894
toil and trouble.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.397
Everyone nice
and lubricated out there?

26:46.480 --> 26:48.190
What the fucking hell?

26:48.274 --> 26:49.734
- What is this?
What's happening?
- [Rose] How are you?

26:49.817 --> 26:51.610
How you doing
in the cheap seats?

26:51.694 --> 26:53.237
Did we get cheap seats?

26:53.321 --> 26:54.822
Now I just want you
to think about something.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.157
Especially you

26:56.240 --> 26:57.408
with your hand precariously

26:57.491 --> 26:58.617
close to your crotch there...

26:58.701 --> 27:00.328
- What did she say?
- Crotch.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.662
She said "crotch."

27:01.746 --> 27:03.331
She's never said "crotch" ever.

27:03.414 --> 27:04.790
This is not possible.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.250
Every girl
you see working tonight,

27:06.334 --> 27:07.918
shaking their moneymakers,
has a father.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.587
That's right. Me, too.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.464
I have a father.
Goes by Abraham.

27:11.547 --> 27:12.965
- Moneymakers? How does she...?
- I'm scared.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.301
- I'm suddenly quite scared.
- Miriam, what is this?

27:15.384 --> 27:17.428
He thought I'd grow up
to be the perfect lady,

27:17.511 --> 27:18.971
and here I am
slinging dick jokes

27:19.055 --> 27:20.556
in a strip club
to a bunch of drunk men

27:20.639 --> 27:21.974
with various degrees
of syphilis,

27:22.058 --> 27:23.225
so happy Father's Day!

27:23.309 --> 27:24.769
What kind of jokes were those?

27:24.852 --> 27:26.312
Dick, I believe. Dick jokes.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.773
- She's slinging 'em.
- This is my act.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.901
So my parents are living with
me now, and they bicker a lot.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.111
So many disagreements.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.988
In fact, the only time
I hear my mother agreeing

27:36.072 --> 27:38.908
with my father is, every couple
months they'll go to bed,

27:38.991 --> 27:41.202
and about ten minutes later,
I'll hear my mother saying,

27:41.285 --> 27:44.789
"Yes, Abe! Yes! Yes! Yes!"

27:44.872 --> 27:47.792
It reminds me
of sharing a common wall

27:47.875 --> 27:49.502
with my brother
back in the day...

27:49.585 --> 27:51.796
Noah, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.881
About what? What?
What's she going to say?

27:53.964 --> 27:57.468
My brother Noah was
the usual active teenager.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.720
No, no, he didn't play sports.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.139
He was active in that other
way teenage boys are.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.808
- Oh, God.
- Ooh.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.727
The slightest stimulation
sent him running to his bedroom.

28:06.811 --> 28:09.730
Vivien Leigh on the cover
of Time, back to the bedroom.

28:09.814 --> 28:12.525
Eleanor Roosevelt driving
a Jeep, back to the bedroom.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.319
Lassie licking her privates,
back to the bedroom.

28:15.403 --> 28:18.114
My God, the boy went through
the household hand cream

28:18.197 --> 28:19.407
like it was water.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.409
You still use
a lot of hand cream.

28:21.492 --> 28:23.994
- Yeah, well...
- Then he met his high school
sweetheart Shira.

28:24.078 --> 28:25.913
So madly in love.

28:25.996 --> 28:28.165
Made him forget
all about Eleanor Roosevelt.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.042
But then he pulled a switcheroo.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.002
Dumped the perfect balaboosta

28:32.086 --> 28:33.796
for a blonde shiksa
with perfect skin,

28:33.879 --> 28:36.382
like she stepped off the cover
of Nuremberg Monthly.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.259
That is
a completely made-up magazine.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.928
But my mother, ooh, boy,

28:41.011 --> 28:42.596
my mother.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.225
Who is a bigger flirt
than my damn mother?

28:46.308 --> 28:48.853
That's how we always got
the best parking space

28:48.936 --> 28:51.272
or talked a cop
out of giving us a ticket

28:51.355 --> 28:53.399
or snagged extra bagels
at the deli.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.026
"Oh, do make it
a baker's dozen, Ezra.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.237
Thank you so much. Oh."

28:58.320 --> 28:59.947
Does my father ever wonder

29:00.030 --> 29:01.991
why he's never had
to change a light bulb?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.118
The woman has
our building's supers

29:04.201 --> 29:06.579
pawing and sniffing at her
like they're horny dogs

29:06.662 --> 29:08.247
and she's got a rump roast

29:08.330 --> 29:10.624
- up her skirt.
- My God.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.835
- I never have had
to change a light bulb.
- Oops!

29:12.918 --> 29:14.462
That's my signal.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.297
Time to hold on
to your wheelchairs, fellas,

29:16.380 --> 29:19.717
'cause here comes Lorna
Luscious, sexy candy striper!

29:19.800 --> 29:22.094
The perfect place to stop. Rose!

29:22.178 --> 29:24.138
Did I miss something?

29:24.221 --> 29:25.931
No. Nothing. Nothing at all.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.725
[laughter]

29:27.808 --> 29:30.769
Now stand off to the side there,

29:30.853 --> 29:33.689
Rose, as I say goodbye

29:33.772 --> 29:35.983
to the audience.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.777
Thank you
for joining me tonight.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.654
It was my great honor.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.907
The little boy inside me

29:42.990 --> 29:45.451
- is grateful, as well.
- [audience clamoring]

29:45.534 --> 29:47.953
Are you still wondering

29:48.037 --> 29:50.915
what my superpower was?

29:50.998 --> 29:52.666
It was always this.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.168
That I could hold you.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.712
Your attention, your interest.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.589
Oh.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.925
And that I could make
really neat exits.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.595
- [audience gasping]
- [applause]

30:09.725 --> 30:11.352
[indistinct chatter]

30:11.435 --> 30:13.854
So what happened?
You all look so strange.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.940
May I talk to you outside?

30:17.191 --> 30:18.567
Miriam.

30:18.651 --> 30:19.944
Miriam, my arm.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.904
Why in God's name
did you not tell me

30:21.987 --> 30:23.614
you saw me at the Wolford?

30:23.697 --> 30:25.282
Your stripper club?

30:25.366 --> 30:27.117
I've never set foot in it.

30:27.201 --> 30:29.828
You just recreated my act,
word for word.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.247
Except for the couple of words
that you rearranged

30:31.330 --> 30:33.415
- and improved it.
- Impossible.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.251
Mama!

30:35.334 --> 30:37.294
Okay, I went to your club.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.255
There was a woman in a bathtub.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.215
And then you came out
and did that thing you do.

30:41.298 --> 30:43.175
- Did he hypnotize me in there?
- [Noah] Astrid, wait!

30:43.259 --> 30:44.885
- What did I say?
- Leave me alone!

30:44.969 --> 30:46.595
- Astrid, please.
- Oh, go back to Shira!

30:46.679 --> 30:48.389
With her pinched lips
and her blotchy skin

30:48.472 --> 30:50.015
and her oversized bosom!

30:50.099 --> 30:52.142
As if you never think
about Royceton Hobbingsworth.

30:52.226 --> 30:54.270
What if I do? What if I think
of what would have happened

30:54.353 --> 30:56.230
if Royceton hadn't
joined the Navy.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.898
Or gotten into that accident.

30:57.982 --> 30:59.650
Or slept with my mother!

30:59.733 --> 31:01.110
Astrid, please!

31:01.193 --> 31:02.695
Why did you even come see me?

31:02.778 --> 31:04.488
What was the point?
Just to torture yourself?

31:04.572 --> 31:06.740
Because I had to see for myself.

31:06.824 --> 31:10.244
- See what?
- The very thing that was
imperiling my business.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.329
- This again?
- Yes, this again.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.415
What you do affects me.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.792
And your father,
everyone around you.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.752
We're connected, Miriam.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.421
Now tell me
what I said in there!

31:20.504 --> 31:23.048
First of all, it's more
than every couple of months.

31:23.132 --> 31:24.883
Papa, not now.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.885
From this day forward,
I'm keeping a log,

31:26.969 --> 31:28.804
just so we're all
on the same page.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.265
And I will change
the light bulbs

31:31.348 --> 31:33.225
from now on, flirt.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.852
[Midge] Mama...

31:34.935 --> 31:37.104
once and for all,
you have to accept what I do.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.106
And for the life of me,
I do not understand

31:39.189 --> 31:40.774
how it could possibly
affect your business.

31:40.858 --> 31:42.276
That doesn't matter now.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.320
I don't have a business anymore.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.364
- Because of me?
- No, because I'm giving up.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.658
They said stop, I will stop.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.994
No, you go on.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.079
You love what you're doing.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.332
You're happier now
than you've been in years.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.584
I did like what I was doing,
but I'm not like you.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.878
- I'm not a fighter.
- My journey's not so different

32:00.961 --> 32:02.379
from the one you're on, Mama.

32:02.463 --> 32:03.964
Mine just involves
more naked women

32:04.048 --> 32:05.466
- and dick jokes.
- Your mouth.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.051
Yours, too.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.802
It's easy to quit, but don't.

32:08.886 --> 32:10.888
Don't quit. Don't stop.

32:13.641 --> 32:15.643
[laughing]

32:16.894 --> 32:18.896
Oh, man!

32:20.731 --> 32:22.399
What happened in there?

32:22.483 --> 32:24.234
Let me tell you
over a bottle or two of sherry.

32:24.318 --> 32:27.279
[♪ Artie Shaw:
"The Grabtown Grapple"]

32:27.363 --> 32:29.239
[Rose] I said what?!

32:32.534 --> 32:34.453
[Abe] You have a weakness
for men with mustaches.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.954
That's what they all
have in common.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.373
The doormen here don't
have mustaches.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.124
So you admit that you're
attracted to the doormen.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.835
- Hello.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, who are you?

32:41.919 --> 32:43.671
- What are you doing here?
- Explain yourself, sir.

32:43.754 --> 32:46.215
- Don't flirt with him.
- How is that flirting?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.591
There was a lilt.
You gave it a lilt.

32:47.675 --> 32:48.967
Are you with them?

32:49.051 --> 32:50.344
- Who?
- That group.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.970
I'm with a group.

32:52.054 --> 32:54.556
Guys, go inside.
Frank here is a...

32:54.640 --> 32:56.558
an associate of Susie's.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.769
It's okay. Go, go, go.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.940
I'll be right in.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.611
Midge, that girl you sent us
after, Mei Lin?

33:07.695 --> 33:10.197
We're backing off.
It's too hot, lava hot.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.865
Too hot? How so?

33:11.949 --> 33:13.659
Her family?
Those are dangerous people.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.202
You don't fuck
with those people.

33:15.285 --> 33:17.413
They'll just disappear you.
Like you never existed at all.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.331
- Oh! Aah!
- Aah!

33:19.415 --> 33:21.750
- [screams]
- Julie, hi.
Sorry to startle you.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.043
Was that a gun?

33:23.127 --> 33:25.671
Yes, but it's a comedy gun.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.923
- Right?
- Yeah, a comedy gun.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.884
- Frank here is
my sometimes comedy partner.
- Like on the weekends.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.594
- The gun shoots
flowers out of it.
- It's a very funny gun.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.555
Sorry to startle you.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.057
You really should stop stalking
around this hallway, Miriam.

33:37.141 --> 33:39.309
You're right. I will stop.

33:39.393 --> 33:41.770
- Good night, Julie.
- Good night, Julie.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.066
Look, the less you know
about this girl's family,

33:46.150 --> 33:49.069
the better, and please
do not tell anyone

33:49.153 --> 33:50.946
we were snooping around them.
Anyone.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.573
- It didn't happen.
- Okay.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.825
And apologize to Julie for me.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.077
What happened here was
unprofessional.

33:57.161 --> 33:59.163
- I will.
- Okay.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.922
It's off to the races.

34:09.006 --> 34:12.509
A jaunty
Oleg Cassini flax helmet

34:12.593 --> 34:14.720
accessorizes this mischievous

34:14.803 --> 34:16.597
tri-colored dress.

34:16.680 --> 34:20.434
A black scroll resembling
the work of a Zen master

34:20.517 --> 34:24.062
accentuates the vertical
romanticism of this dress.

34:24.146 --> 34:26.815
The Lilly Daché hat is the icing

34:26.899 --> 34:29.276
on this tasty cake.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.445
And finally, pomegranate

34:31.528 --> 34:34.656
polka dots weave
through rectangular cutouts

34:34.740 --> 34:38.035
as a peekaboo bodice
frames the modified boatneck.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.287
A chic version
of a fisherman's rain hat

34:40.370 --> 34:42.414
completes the ensemble.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.839
And now for this afternoon's
entertainment,

34:50.923 --> 34:53.801
we have a very funny lady
who is going to tell some jokes,

34:53.884 --> 34:56.970
and then we'll have cake
from Gino's Pastry Shop.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.097
May I introduce to you,

34:59.181 --> 35:01.225
Mrs. Miriam Maisel.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.602
[audience applauds]

35:08.732 --> 35:10.526
[exhales]

35:10.609 --> 35:13.487
John F. Kennedy is
running for president.

35:14.488 --> 35:16.949
I know. It's great.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.701
Right?
We'll have a young, smart,

35:19.785 --> 35:22.204
handsome president,
and, boy, is he gonna be busy.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.122
Have you read his platform yet?

35:24.206 --> 35:26.083
He's got a six-point health care
plan that includes everything

35:26.166 --> 35:28.919
from building new hospitals
to spiffier paper gowns

35:29.002 --> 35:30.629
and turning the heat on
so you don't freeze

35:30.712 --> 35:32.172
your tush off
in the examining room.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.215
[laughter]

35:33.298 --> 35:34.758
He's gonna give
more money to NASA

35:34.842 --> 35:36.844
and we are gonna send
a man to the moon

35:36.927 --> 35:38.846
before the Soviets.

35:38.929 --> 35:41.098
All these things
sound wonderful.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.141
What could possibly be
the downside of him winning?

35:43.225 --> 35:45.686
What should we,
every single woman in this room,

35:45.769 --> 35:48.647
be very, very afraid of?

35:51.692 --> 35:53.485
- This.
- [laughter]

35:53.569 --> 35:57.364
If he wins, this is going
to be the first lady.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.157
Can you imagine, you wake up,

35:59.241 --> 36:02.119
your hair in curlers,
pillow creases on your face,

36:02.202 --> 36:04.204
and you sit down at the table
and pick this up,

36:04.288 --> 36:06.498
and see that face
first thing in the morning?

36:06.582 --> 36:09.251
I mean, really, is that fair?

36:09.334 --> 36:12.462
And it's not just the face
or the clothes or the poise--

36:12.546 --> 36:13.797
I mean, didn't they invent
the word "poise"

36:13.881 --> 36:15.007
just to describe this woman?

36:15.090 --> 36:17.634
Can you picture Jackie Kennedy

36:17.718 --> 36:19.136
having a bad hair day?

36:19.219 --> 36:20.596
Or chipped nail polish?

36:20.679 --> 36:22.931
Can you imagine her
with mustard on her shirt?

36:23.015 --> 36:25.893
Or with cramps? Now, Pat Nixon,
that woman has cramps.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.561
Probably every single day.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.730
I'm sure Pat's a very nice lady,

36:29.813 --> 36:31.356
but I feel like I know
what she looks like

36:31.440 --> 36:33.233
after a night with her in-laws.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.444
Exhausted, slightly drunk,

36:35.527 --> 36:37.905
full of resentment,
and suddenly realizing

36:37.988 --> 36:40.032
the ice pick can be used
on something other than ice.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.409
But not Jackie.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.369
Her in-laws love her.

36:44.453 --> 36:47.039
They eat her roast
and bring her flowers.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.124
She's fluent in French, Spanish

36:49.207 --> 36:50.542
and Italian and Yiddish.

36:50.626 --> 36:51.960
Okay, I have no proof
about the last one,

36:52.044 --> 36:53.295
but I still believe it's true.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.173
- [laughter]
- Do we really want a first lady

36:56.256 --> 36:58.091
who looks like this on a horse?

36:58.175 --> 36:59.968
Or do we want a first lady

37:00.052 --> 37:02.012
who looks a little more
like the horse?

37:02.095 --> 37:03.472
I mean an attractive horse.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.182
I'm talking Buttermilk,
not Trigger.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.685
- We women are dealing
with a lot.
- [woman] Right.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.562
Do we really need
to be constantly comparing

37:10.646 --> 37:13.565
ourselves...
Oh, come on!

37:13.649 --> 37:16.443
Who has that kind
of perfect facial expression

37:16.526 --> 37:18.195
while they're at the beach?

37:18.278 --> 37:20.697
Where's the sunburn?
The sweat stains?

37:20.781 --> 37:23.033
Where's the grape soda stain
from her daughter

37:23.116 --> 37:24.743
throwing up on her
after the first time

37:24.826 --> 37:26.703
she swung her around
in the ocean?

37:26.787 --> 37:28.747
Where is the look
on Jackie's face that says,

37:28.830 --> 37:30.707
"If I just let go right now..."

37:30.791 --> 37:32.292
[audience clamoring]

37:32.376 --> 37:34.002
She is absolutely perfect.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.213
Here's a charming,
little anecdote.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.589
"When the senator lost the notes

37:37.673 --> 37:38.966
for a speech
which he had planned

37:39.049 --> 37:41.009
to end with a quote
from Tennyson's Ulysses,

37:41.093 --> 37:43.428
Jackie bailed him out of trouble
by quickly reciting

37:43.512 --> 37:44.930
the appropriate lines
from memory."

37:45.013 --> 37:46.932
[audience] Oh...

37:47.015 --> 37:48.934
Who are you?!

37:49.017 --> 37:50.852
That was Pat Nixon asking,

37:50.936 --> 37:52.729
not me.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.773
That's a cute outfit.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.692
That's cute, too.
Sorry, I'm just shopping now.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.402
You know,

37:58.485 --> 38:00.404
I used to have a dress
like this.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.989
Called it my lucky dress.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.074
And it was until... well,

38:04.157 --> 38:06.243
that's a story for another time.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.954
[audience clamoring]

38:09.037 --> 38:11.081
Nope, wrong venue.
It's a little racy.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.792
There's baby carrots here.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.086
We'll cover them up
with the mashed potatoes.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.257
All right.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.342
[audience cheering]

38:24.219 --> 38:27.514
Well, I am recently divorced.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.474
And a little lonely.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.351
And a couple weeks ago,
I meet this man.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.437
He seemed really nice,
very handsome,

38:33.520 --> 38:35.522
and I was in my lucky dress.
Perfect combo.

38:35.605 --> 38:38.275
So we go for coffee,
but the coffee place is closed.

38:38.358 --> 38:40.777
And so he suggests a little
coffee at his apartment.

38:40.861 --> 38:43.447
Anyhow, he was out of coffee,
so we had sex.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.033
- [audience gasping]
- Now, I know
what you're thinking.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.201
He didn't have tea? Soda?

38:48.285 --> 38:50.162
Fruit can be hydrating.
How about an apple?

38:50.245 --> 38:51.872
The only other option was sex?

38:51.955 --> 38:53.999
Yes. It's my story,
so deal with it.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.961
So we had sex and it was great.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.213
When suddenly
the door flies open,

39:00.297 --> 39:02.674
and this crazed woman comes in
with a little dog

39:02.758 --> 39:04.134
and starts yelling
and screaming,

39:04.217 --> 39:05.385
and I'm thinking,
"Who is this nut?"

39:05.469 --> 39:06.845
And I was about to suggest
we call the police

39:06.928 --> 39:08.513
until I realized
it was his wife.

39:08.597 --> 39:10.223
[audience gasping]

39:10.307 --> 39:11.933
I couldn't believe it.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.436
I was the other woman.
I was the harlot.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.314
The strumpet.
I was all the things

39:17.397 --> 39:19.149
I called my husband's mistress.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.318
Can you imagine
catching your husband

39:21.401 --> 39:23.653
with another woman in your bed?

39:23.737 --> 39:26.698
But as I was laying there,
in her bed,

39:26.782 --> 39:29.201
- under her sheets, I...
- [woman crying]

39:37.834 --> 39:40.754
Hey, look on the bright side.

39:40.837 --> 39:43.590
She got to keep my lucky dress.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.675
[women sobbing]

39:48.345 --> 39:49.721
Where's that cake?

39:49.805 --> 39:51.264
[woman sobs loudly]

39:51.348 --> 39:53.350
[phone ringing]

39:58.730 --> 40:00.357
Susie Myerson and Associates.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.400
- [Midge] Hey, got a question.
- Sure, what?

40:02.484 --> 40:04.986
So, lunch tomorrow,
Dinah told me 1:30,

40:05.070 --> 40:06.738
but is that what time lunch is,
or is that an hour before

40:06.822 --> 40:09.032
the actual lunch because she
figures I'll be an hour late?

40:09.116 --> 40:10.492
Well, if she thinks
you'll be an hour late,

40:10.575 --> 40:11.827
that means
we're meeting at 2:30.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.203
And she told me 12:45.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.080
And she knows I won't be
more than 15 minutes late

40:15.163 --> 40:16.331
'cause I'm coming
from the Upper East Side,

40:16.414 --> 40:17.374
so that doesn't make sense.

40:17.457 --> 40:18.667
And I know she schedules
these things

40:18.750 --> 40:20.460
around my being late,
so I'm already adjusting

40:20.544 --> 40:22.796
to that, so is she adjusting
to my adjustment?

40:22.879 --> 40:25.090
You know, none of this matters,
because tonight's the night.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.509
I'm taking Dinah out to dinner
so we can have the talk.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.469
I let her pick
the place and everything.

40:29.553 --> 40:30.887
Oh, the talk.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.472
Yeah, my hiring/firing book

40:32.556 --> 40:34.099
says you should show
as much respect as you can

40:34.182 --> 40:35.475
to the person you're
canning so they don't

40:35.559 --> 40:37.185
show up
and kill you or something.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.562
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

40:38.645 --> 40:39.855
And I'll have a little
something for you, too.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.565
A little something?
What little something?

40:41.648 --> 40:43.358
Besides a cupcake
that Ethel Kennedy touched,

40:43.441 --> 40:45.443
which makes it special, I'm
bringing your cut of the gig.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.154
- What gig?
- A gig. I picked up a gig.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.363
I didn't get you a gig.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.948
Well, it was just
a money gig I did.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.324
It falls
into the money category.

40:51.408 --> 40:52.492
I'm all dolled up.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.452
Okay, I have to go,

40:54.536 --> 40:56.163
but tomorrow
I'll be very interested

40:56.246 --> 40:58.039
in hearing
about what this gig was

40:58.123 --> 40:59.583
that you did
that I didn't book for you.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.252
- Okay, I'll see you at 1:30.
- 12:45.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.504
You clean up nice.

41:04.588 --> 41:06.381
Thanks. So do you. Shall we go?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.049
Sure, but, hey, you know what?

41:08.133 --> 41:09.718
Why don't you take
that coat that you leave here

41:09.801 --> 41:11.261
- all the time?
- Why?

41:11.344 --> 41:13.513
There's been a string of
burglaries in the neighborhood.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.056
Wouldn't want someone
to take it.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.017
Good deal.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.977
Here, I had
this bag lying around.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.521
Put your coat in the bag.

41:21.605 --> 41:24.441
You should take
these pictures, too.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.318
- Just to be safe.
- Okay.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.069
Is this something you like?

41:28.153 --> 41:29.613
My nephew made it
for me at camp.

41:29.696 --> 41:33.450
Yeah, throw that in. This, too.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.493
Okay.

41:35.577 --> 41:38.580
That is it.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.831
Let's eat.

41:39.915 --> 41:42.125
[indistinct chatter]

41:42.209 --> 41:44.044
Chicken and waffles
with collard greens?

41:44.127 --> 41:46.213
I mean, who knew this would be
an appetizing combination?

41:46.296 --> 41:48.173
Well, it's good, so someone did.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.841
I like people with a vision.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.092
Listen, Dinah...

41:51.176 --> 41:52.719
Damn, there's Hank.
Scoot to the right.

41:52.802 --> 41:54.221
- Why?
- To block him.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.514
- Fine.
- Little more.

41:56.598 --> 41:59.309
- Little more, little more,
little more, little more, stop!
- You good?

41:59.392 --> 42:00.685
- I'm good.
- Okay.

42:00.769 --> 42:02.103
So, Dinah, I want to make sure

42:02.187 --> 42:03.521
you're happy in this job,

42:03.605 --> 42:05.398
'cause if you're not,
we need to talk.

42:05.482 --> 42:06.691
Oh, I'm happy.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.735
- You don't seem it.
- I'm super happy.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.779
I'm happier than I've ever been
in my whole life.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.698
Had a toy dog made of wood when
I was a kid. You pull the leash

42:13.782 --> 42:15.700
and he wags his tail and walks
and his eyes move?

42:15.784 --> 42:17.869
That brought me a ton of joy.
This is better.

42:17.953 --> 42:20.580
Right, but as your employer,
I need to be happy, as well.

42:20.664 --> 42:22.165
I'm trying to picture you happy.

42:22.249 --> 42:23.750
It's a struggle.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.961
Yeah, maybe I don't get skip-
around, all-happy-pappy happy,

42:26.044 --> 42:28.046
but I am talking
satisfied employer happy.

42:28.129 --> 42:29.589
See, I have to constantly be...

42:29.673 --> 42:32.467
Hey, hey, sorry, y'all.
Dinner's ruined. James is here.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.719
- Are you kidding me?
- I didn't bring you here
for chicken and waffles.

42:34.803 --> 42:36.179
I brought you here to see James.

42:36.263 --> 42:37.722
That's right.
It's a comedian doing comedy.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.683
- Dinah...
- Comedy being

42:39.766 --> 42:40.892
the only way
a Black man can kill

42:40.976 --> 42:42.269
and have
a room full of white people

42:42.352 --> 42:43.561
tell him, "Good job."

42:43.645 --> 42:44.813
[man] Sit down, James.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.314
[James] Brother, you look
like you killed somebody.

42:46.398 --> 42:48.316
Look, I killed somebody, too,
so on the count of three,

42:48.400 --> 42:49.985
let's both say who we killed.

42:50.068 --> 42:51.903
Don't worry,
nobody's listening anyway.

42:51.987 --> 42:53.697
One, two, three.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.031
Bing Crosby.

42:55.115 --> 42:58.451
Welched on a golf bet,
so I smoked his ass.

42:58.535 --> 43:00.287
We got some folks
at the lunch counter right now,

43:00.370 --> 43:01.871
they're protesting me
still talking.

43:01.955 --> 43:03.957
He's super clumsy,
but I think he's funny.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.458
[James] Look,
I'm trying to be nice.

43:05.542 --> 43:07.919
My mama always said
you get more with sugar

43:08.003 --> 43:09.879
than you get with vinegar.

43:09.963 --> 43:12.299
I guess that's why
she only got her left foot now,

43:12.382 --> 43:13.383
'cause of all that sugar.

43:13.466 --> 43:14.759
[both laugh]

43:14.843 --> 43:16.678
Yeah, I figured folks with
diabetes wouldn't laugh at that,

43:16.761 --> 43:19.097
so I just learned a whole lot
about you all here.

43:19.180 --> 43:21.266
Hey, hey, pour some more
syrup on that shit, brother.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.435
My mama would kill me

43:23.518 --> 43:25.312
if she knew
I was doing this tonight.

43:25.395 --> 43:27.439
She worked her whole life
to keep me out of danger,

43:27.522 --> 43:29.733
and here I am doing the most
dangerous thing you can do--

43:29.816 --> 43:31.484
interrupt Black folks
while they eat.

43:31.568 --> 43:34.404
You know, I'm actually trying to
get beyond the Negro audience.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.531
Because everything's
aimed at white people.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.491
I mean,
that's where the money is.

43:38.575 --> 43:40.493
I mean,
think about children's stories.

43:40.577 --> 43:42.162
If Hansel and Gretel were Black,

43:42.245 --> 43:44.789
that story would be four lines.

43:44.873 --> 43:47.459
The kids leave cornbread crumbs
to follow their tracks.

43:47.542 --> 43:49.336
The witch catches
up to 'em and say,

43:49.419 --> 43:50.795
"What's that cornbread recipe?"

43:50.879 --> 43:52.714
Together they make the greatest
cornbread of all time.

43:52.797 --> 43:55.592
She forgets to eat 'em,
end of story.

43:55.675 --> 43:58.595
- Black Beauty, yeah...
- You found this guy?

43:58.678 --> 44:00.305
Yeah, I've seen him twice.
He just seems special.

44:00.388 --> 44:02.265
- [James] Thank you,
Anna Sewell...
- Yeah.

44:02.349 --> 44:03.933
- He is.
- [man] Don't quit your day job.

44:04.017 --> 44:06.853
You know, I-I don't just play
at smelly restaurants.

44:06.936 --> 44:10.482
I also play a wide range
of upscale lavatories

44:10.565 --> 44:12.942
- all across the tristate area.
- [man] Where my pork chop at?

44:13.026 --> 44:15.028
- Hey, Junior!
- Hey, James.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.489
Dinah Ruttles. What's up?

44:17.572 --> 44:19.449
This is Susie.
I told you about her.

44:19.532 --> 44:21.534
Refresh my memory.

44:21.618 --> 44:23.578
- I'm a talent manager.
- All right.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.246
Look, I think
you're funny as hell.

44:25.330 --> 44:27.290
- But...
- What?

44:27.374 --> 44:29.042
There's always
a "but" with you people.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.168
Don't do that.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.212
Okay, fair enough,
here's the but.

44:32.295 --> 44:33.963
But you got lousy segues.

44:34.047 --> 44:36.091
Yeah, I know
I've got some segue issues.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.051
And you meander.
You got a lot of topics.

44:38.134 --> 44:40.136
- Too many.
- Well, I got a lot
of things on my mind.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.638
Good. Hone it.

44:41.721 --> 44:43.098
Anything else?

44:43.181 --> 44:45.975
- You got management?
- Managers just take your money.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.436
Oh, yeah? You got a lot
of experience with managers?

44:48.520 --> 44:50.730
- I've heard things.
- Well, have you heard
that without a manager,

44:50.814 --> 44:53.024
you'll be working men's rooms
for the next ten years?

44:53.108 --> 44:55.235
She full of shit?

44:55.318 --> 44:57.028
- Not about this.
- I want to manage you.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.822
Let's try it for six months.

44:58.905 --> 45:01.449
See if, at the very least, I can
get you into better bathrooms.

45:02.826 --> 45:04.536
You got a card?

45:04.619 --> 45:06.621
Hmm.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.416
Take a fry.

45:09.499 --> 45:11.584
Call me tomorrow.
I'll buy you lunch.

45:14.629 --> 45:16.631
Later, James.

45:18.383 --> 45:19.884
I should get home.

45:19.968 --> 45:22.262
My mama gets worried
when I'm out and I don't call.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.180
Here, I'll take this.

45:24.264 --> 45:26.391
Oh, so I'm coming back tomorrow?

45:26.474 --> 45:28.184
Yeah. Of course you are.

45:28.268 --> 45:29.477
9:30, don't be late.

45:29.561 --> 45:31.938
Okay, just have your pants on

45:32.021 --> 45:33.523
when I get there.

45:33.606 --> 45:36.234
Yeah, I almost never
not have my pants on.

45:36.317 --> 45:38.611
- What's the purple?
- I'm guessing it's an eggplant.

45:38.695 --> 45:41.114
- Or a grape.
- [Midge] I don't want Esther
dressed as an eggplant.

45:41.197 --> 45:42.824
She doesn't want Esther
dressed as an eggplant.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.117
That's why the choices.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.994
You got your pumpkin,
you got your carrot,

45:46.077 --> 45:48.079
- you got a couple
varieties of beans.
- You hear that?

45:48.163 --> 45:50.165
A pineapple would
look cute on Esther.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.499
Any sweet fruit would
look good on her.

45:51.583 --> 45:52.709
Just don't make her savory.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.294
A sweet fruit for Esther.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.212
And Ethan'll probably want
to be a banana or a carrot.

45:56.296 --> 45:58.423
You know, those shapes
that boys are so obsessed with.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.633
- Got it, carrot for Ethan.
- [Moishe] Easy-peasy.

46:00.717 --> 46:02.844
- [Joel] So we're good to go?
- Sure.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.512
- We're good, Pop.
- I'll tell your mother.

46:04.596 --> 46:06.556
Hey, Pop, why don't you stay
and have a quick drink?

46:06.639 --> 46:08.141
I won't say no to that.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.226
- Meet me at the bar.
- You got it.

46:12.395 --> 46:14.314
So, look, I'm telling Pop

46:14.397 --> 46:16.274
tonight about Mei.
About everything.

46:16.357 --> 46:18.276
- I'd say it's overdue.
- I know.

46:18.359 --> 46:20.069
I'm just telling you
as a courtesy.

46:20.153 --> 46:22.489
They'll probably call Abe
and Rose as soon as they hear.

46:22.572 --> 46:24.574
Okay. Thanks for the heads-up.

46:24.657 --> 46:26.159
Pineapple and carrot's good.

46:26.242 --> 46:27.577
It's gonna work.

46:27.660 --> 46:30.205
I agree. Keep me posted.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.707
[Gordon] Welcome back, you're
watching The Gordon Ford Show.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.376
And we got funny man
Lenny Bruce.

46:35.460 --> 46:38.129
So, Carnegie Hall, you nervous
about filling the place?

46:38.213 --> 46:41.174
Not until about three seconds
ago, Gordy, no.

46:41.257 --> 46:42.800
[laughs] Yeah,
but you don't have

46:42.884 --> 46:44.636
performance anxiety anymore,
do you, Lenny?

46:44.719 --> 46:46.137
[audience laughing]

46:46.221 --> 46:48.598
Wait a minute, wait a...
[laughs]

46:48.681 --> 46:51.226
Wait a minute, no, no, no,
no, you know what I meant.

46:51.309 --> 46:53.102
Now, come on, l-let's-let's
keep it clean here, folks.

46:53.186 --> 46:54.729
Nabisco's one of our sponsors.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.648
[Lenny] Hey, it's your audience
who's got the dirty mind.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.900
Mine is clean as Anita Bryant's.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.652
Well, you're gonna
fill the place.

47:00.735 --> 47:02.695
- I've got confidence in you.
- Okay, look, uh...

47:02.779 --> 47:06.282
I'm going to awkwardly shill
for myself here, Gordy.

47:06.366 --> 47:09.369
My manager made me promise,
so here goes.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.621
Uh, z-zoom in on me, guys.

47:11.704 --> 47:13.706
Uh, come on.

47:13.790 --> 47:15.750
There you go.
Oh, watch the cue card, though.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.877
All right, that's... real...
There it is.

47:17.961 --> 47:20.630
Uh... [laughs]

47:20.713 --> 47:23.716
Folks, this is Lenny Bruce.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.803
Asking you to please, please

47:26.886 --> 47:29.681
come to my show at the hall
they call Carnegie.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.641
My self-esteem is at risk here.

47:31.724 --> 47:34.936
A less-than-sold-out show
would shatter my fragile ego

47:35.019 --> 47:37.772
and hurt something very dear
to the lawyers of America,

47:37.855 --> 47:39.440
my bank account.

47:39.524 --> 47:42.402
So come to my show.

47:42.485 --> 47:45.738
And buy Nabisco products,
for Gordy's sake.

47:45.822 --> 47:47.949
I'm telling you,
dunk a Ritz Cracker

47:48.032 --> 47:51.327
in a dry whiskey... tasty, gang.

47:51.411 --> 47:52.996
[Gordon] Okay, well, how about
we get some Ritz Crackers

47:53.079 --> 47:54.872
and whiskey for everyone
in the audience, huh?

47:54.956 --> 47:57.375
[audience cheering]

47:57.417 --> 47:58.876
[♪ "Que Será, Será"]

47:58.960 --> 48:00.795
Let's clink, kiddo.
You know your mother.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.714
She's gonna want me home
at some point.

48:02.797 --> 48:05.258
[both] L'chaim.

48:05.341 --> 48:07.093
So, what's on your mind?

48:07.176 --> 48:08.970
Just wanted to have a drink
with my favorite father.

48:09.053 --> 48:10.722
Once more, with feeling.

48:10.805 --> 48:13.224
Okay. So I know I was
a little cagey before,

48:13.308 --> 48:14.767
about this girl I'm seeing.

48:14.851 --> 48:16.811
- Supposedly seeing.
- There is a girl.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.730
A great girl. The name's Mei.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.940
May? A lovely month,
a lovely name.

48:21.024 --> 48:23.234
And she is going to be a doctor.

48:23.318 --> 48:24.902
So that part is true?
Good for you.

48:24.986 --> 48:26.821
And it looks
like we're gonna get married.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.906
Yes!
We should've gotten doubles.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.366
I can fix that.

48:30.450 --> 48:33.202
Married!
Your mother's gonna plotz!

48:33.286 --> 48:35.622
