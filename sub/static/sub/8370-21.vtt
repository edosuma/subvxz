01:08.820 --> 01:10.490
<i>Get outta here, Janja!</i>

01:10.530 --> 01:12.530
Come on, Kion.
It was just one gazelle.

01:15.490 --> 01:18.410
Okay. Okay.
See, we're back in the Outlands.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.990
You happy?

01:20.030 --> 01:22.790
And this time, stay there!

01:22.820 --> 01:24.690
Nice work everybody.
Let's go.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.824
All right.
Come on, fellas.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.260
- Huh? Where are we going, Janja?
- Where else?

01:35.290 --> 01:37.180
To get that gazelle.

01:37.210 --> 01:41.780
- Um... Back in the Pride Lands?
- Uh, Janja?

01:41.820 --> 01:45.630
Didn't the Lion Guard tell us
to stay out of the Pride Lands?

01:45.670 --> 01:49.080
Yeah. And since when do we
take orders from the Lion Guard?

01:49.110 --> 01:52.172
Um...
Since never?

01:53.640 --> 01:55.604
Huh?

01:58.710 --> 02:00.610
<i>Huh... Hapana.</i>

02:00.640 --> 02:05.450
Looks like Janja and his clan are
heading back into the Pride Lands!

02:05.485 --> 02:07.510
What? Don't they know
when they've been beaten?

02:07.540 --> 02:08.960
Guess they're
not giving up today.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.699
Ugh!
Those hyenas!

02:10.740 --> 02:13.140
C'mon, Lion Guard.
Let's go!

02:13.170 --> 02:14.910
Till the Pride Lands end...

02:14.950 --> 02:16.410
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

02:17.470 --> 02:19.150
Spread out, boys.

02:19.190 --> 02:21.270
I don't see
that gazelle nowhere!

02:21.300 --> 02:23.450
You sure about this, Janja?

02:23.480 --> 02:26.390
We were just chased
out of the Pride Lands.

02:26.430 --> 02:29.150
So if I wanna go
into the Pride Lands,

02:29.190 --> 02:31.140
we go into the Pride Lands!

02:31.170 --> 02:32.410
<i>Janja!</i>

02:32.450 --> 02:34.930
What do you think you're
doing in the Pride Lands?

02:34.970 --> 02:38.340
Nala, is this the Pride Lands?

02:38.370 --> 02:40.580
 I must have got turned around.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.940
I would never wanna go
where I'm not welcome.

02:43.975 --> 02:48.010
But, Janja, you just said...
Stuff it, fur-brain!

02:48.050 --> 02:50.120
The Outlands are that way.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.770
Yeah...
So we keep hearin'.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.100
So go.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.150
Uh, I think
she means it, Janja.

02:56.180 --> 02:57.960
Relax.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.800
She ain't so tough.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.920
Out here all alone.

03:01.950 --> 03:03.440
Outnumbered.

03:05.470 --> 03:06.750
You sure you want
to do this, Janja?

03:06.780 --> 03:08.480
Oh, I'm sure.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.120
The question is...

03:10.150 --> 03:11.860
Are you?

03:22.020 --> 03:23.270
Okay, Janja!

03:23.310 --> 03:24.760
We've got you... Mom!

03:24.790 --> 03:26.080
Kion!

03:26.120 --> 03:27.750
No!

03:27.790 --> 03:29.920
Get away

03:29.960 --> 03:32.100
from my

03:32.130 --> 03:33.730
mom!

03:45.270 --> 03:46.410
Thank you, Kion.

03:46.450 --> 03:47.690
Of course, Mom!

03:47.720 --> 03:49.670
Un-Bunga-lievable!

03:57.200 --> 03:59.550
What's the kerbubble?

04:01.410 --> 04:03.620
Kion, your Roar...

04:03.660 --> 04:05.470
It's coming back towards us!

04:06.790 --> 04:07.680
Whoa!

04:09.500 --> 04:10.730
Oh, no!

04:16.440 --> 04:17.490
Mom!

04:18.450 --> 04:20.130
Mom!
Kion?

04:20.170 --> 04:21.820
Hang on!

04:23.040 --> 04:25.390
Almost...

04:25.420 --> 04:26.330
Got you!

04:30.140 --> 04:31.850
Mom, are you okay?

04:31.890 --> 04:33.130
I'm all right, Kion.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.940
Thanks to you.

04:34.980 --> 04:37.660
I almost lost you.

04:37.690 --> 04:39.640
<i>Kion! Nala!</i>

04:39.680 --> 04:42.190
You're not hurt, are you?
We're fine.

04:42.230 --> 04:45.950
I'll say it again,
Un-Bunga-lievable.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.540
It sure was.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.530
Is everyone okay?

04:48.570 --> 04:50.030
Yup.
Yes.

04:50.070 --> 04:51.190
- Me, too.
- Affirmative.

04:51.220 --> 04:52.720
Huh?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.350
Oh...

04:54.380 --> 04:56.700
What?
What are you all staring at?

04:56.740 --> 05:00.140
Oh, strange. That looks
like one of my feathers.

05:00.170 --> 05:01.580
Should we
say something?

05:01.620 --> 05:03.080
I wouldn't.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.210
Maybe he won't notice.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.950
Notice what?

05:05.990 --> 05:07.580
Huh, funny,
suddenly my head's kinda cold.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.580
<i> Heyvi kabisa.
The Roar did all this?</i>

05:20.430 --> 05:22.250
What's the big deal
about a few missing feathers?

05:22.290 --> 05:23.560
They'll grow back, right?

05:23.590 --> 05:24.510
That's the spirit, Ono!

05:26.110 --> 05:28.170
Oh, no!
That's me?

05:28.210 --> 05:30.750
Yeah, pretty much.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.550
What are all the other
egrets going to say?

05:32.590 --> 05:33.830
You think they'll notice?

05:33.860 --> 05:36.250
Oh, they'll definitely notice.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.440
It's impossible not to notice.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.120
I mean,
everyone's gonna notice.

05:41.150 --> 05:42.680
Bunga.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.930
I mean, no one's gonna notice.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.730
I barely noticed.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.410
My head looks
weird without feathers.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.620
Nah!

05:53.660 --> 05:55.620
Just looks smooth,
like a hippo's backside.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.480
My head looks
like a hippo bottom.

05:57.510 --> 05:58.000
That's something to celebrate.

05:59.570 --> 06:01.090
You look fine from below.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.420
Long as you fly higher than
everyone, they'll never know.

06:04.450 --> 06:07.760

- Well, obviously he didn't look.

08:00.690 --> 08:05.200
So what are you looking at, Kion?
Yeesh...

08:05.230 --> 08:08.010
Scar destroying
his Lion Guard with the Roar.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.810
My uncles say Scar
was the worst lion ever!

Good thing you're the one
with the Roar now, huh?

Ah, there you are!

Thank goodness.

08:21.170 --> 08:22.270
Zazu?

08:22.310 --> 08:23.610
What are you doing here?

08:23.650 --> 08:26.060
Ono's job, apparently.

08:26.090 --> 08:29.092
There's been a rockslide.
No one was injured,

08:29.127 --> 08:31.510
but it cut the giraffes off
from their watering hole.

08:31.550 --> 08:32.960
Oh, no.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.280
Oh, yes, Ono.

08:35.309 --> 08:37.510
<i> Heyvi kabisa!</i>

08:37.549 --> 08:39.070
You would have known
had you been on the lookout.

08:39.110 --> 08:39.870
Oh...

08:41.580 --> 08:42.750
There's nothin'
wrong with him.

08:42.789 --> 08:43.870
He stands out!

08:43.900 --> 08:45.800
Indeed.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.100
In any case,
the giraffes need your help.

08:48.130 --> 08:49.820
Right.
We're on it.

<i>- Lion Guard...
- Ono?</i>

- You coming?
- Uh, I'm not sure.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.710
You've got to come.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.080
You're the keenest of sight.

09:00.110 --> 09:03.340
Beshte's right, Ono.
Come on, we need you.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.295
You heard Kion. Duty calls.

09:05.296 --> 09:07.220
- Mustn't dawdle. Spit spot.
- Whoa! Okay! Okay!

09:07.250 --> 09:10.440
Lion Guard defend.
Lion Guard defend!

09:10.480 --> 09:12.840
Zazu can be pretty persuasive.

09:12.870 --> 09:14.240
Definitely.

09:14.280 --> 09:14.870
Now let's go!

09:21.880 --> 09:23.440
At least the giraffes
are all waiting patiently.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.210
For now.

09:27.130 --> 09:28.580
Hey!

09:28.620 --> 09:29.790
Wait your turn, egg-head!

09:29.830 --> 09:32.550
"Egg-head"?
Is that a reference to how smart I am?

09:32.590 --> 09:37.490
No, it's a reference
to your head looking like an egg!

09:40.640 --> 09:43.190
Hey, don't call Ono
an egg-head!

09:43.200 --> 09:45.790
Yeah! His head looks
more like a hippo bottom!

09:48.170 --> 09:51.240
Um, thanks, Bunga?

09:51.280 --> 09:52.700
The rocks have
blocked the only way in.

09:54.070 --> 09:56.560
Hmm.

09:56.590 --> 09:57.780
<i>Oh, yeah!
This is an easy one.</i>

09:57.820 --> 10:01.530
You can just use the Roar
and blast those rocks away!

10:01.560 --> 10:03.290
Uh, I have a better idea.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.670
Um... Beshte!

10:04.710 --> 10:08.540
If you move that one big rock,
it'll open up the whole thing.

10:08.570 --> 10:10.460
Hmm... Maybe...

10:10.500 --> 10:12.030
Come on, Kion.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.470
Just use the Roar!

10:13.500 --> 10:14.800
Use the Roar!

10:14.840 --> 10:16.340
Use the Roar!

10:16.380 --> 10:18.150
Use the Roar!

10:18.180 --> 10:20.220
Bunga,
we're trying this first.

10:21.410 --> 10:22.420
Beshte?

10:22.450 --> 10:24.360
You got it, Kion.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.320
Everybody stand back.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.730
We don't want
any rocks to hit anybody.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.430
<i> Twende kiboko!</i>

10:37.580 --> 10:39.700
Great news, giraffies!

10:39.740 --> 10:41.760
Your watering hole's
back open!

10:41.800 --> 10:43.480
Plenty of water for everyone!

10:43.520 --> 10:45.210
It worked. Huzzah!

10:45.250 --> 10:46.000
I'm thirsty.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.950
Nice work, Beshte.
Thanks, Kion.

10:53.980 --> 10:55.260
Uh-oh! Now what?

10:59.725 --> 11:01.760
Don't worry, little guy,
we'll get you to safety.

11:01.790 --> 11:02.720
Somehow.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.260
He's a klipspringer!

11:06.300 --> 11:07.200
Can't he just jump
to the other side?

11:07.230 --> 11:09.980
I think the poor little guy's
too scared to move.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.780
We'll have to go get him.

11:13.810 --> 11:15.860
The water's moving
too fast for me, Kion.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.870
And it's too wet for me.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.300
So just stop the water.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.600
You could do it with the Roar.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.110
No, not the Roar.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.740
Um, I have a better idea.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.680
Beshte!
That dead tree!

11:28.720 --> 11:29.990
We can use that to get to him!

11:30.030 --> 11:30.790
Gotcha!

11:32.310 --> 11:33.960
<i> Twende kiboko!</i>

11:37.940 --> 11:39.720
Thanks, Beshte.
I'll go get the klipspringer.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.380
Whoa!
Uh-oh!

11:44.420 --> 11:45.860
Kion!
We'll save you!

11:45.890 --> 11:48.020
Yeah!
No! Go back!

11:48.050 --> 11:50.250
The wood's rotten...

12:00.590 --> 12:01.570
Hey, look!

12:03.920 --> 12:05.130
We did it!

12:05.160 --> 12:06.160
Yeah, great.

12:08.870 --> 12:10.070
At least we're all
in one piece.

12:10.110 --> 12:11.780
<i>Hey, Ono!</i>

12:11.820 --> 12:13.750
Oh, no.
I knew this would happen.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.330
What's with your feathers?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.910
You're bald at both ends!

12:16.940 --> 12:18.450
I know, I... What?

12:18.490 --> 12:19.620
<i> Hapana!</i>

12:19.650 --> 12:21.700
My tail feathers!

12:21.740 --> 12:23.840
That chunk of wood
must've knocked them off!

12:23.870 --> 12:26.140
At least now
everything matches.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.350
This is so embarrassing.

12:31.490 --> 12:32.910
Hey, Kion?

12:32.940 --> 12:35.120
How come you didn't just
use the Roar back there?

12:35.160 --> 12:35.940
No reason.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.600
Aw, come on!

12:38.640 --> 12:41.400
You can tell me.

12:41.430 --> 12:44.000
After what happened
with my mom, I'm afraid

12:44.040 --> 12:45.220
I might hurt someone else
with the Roar.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.270
Say what?

12:47.310 --> 12:49.930
Kion! It's not like
you did that on purpose.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.630
I know, Bunga.
But that's the problem.

12:52.670 --> 12:55.180
I couldn't control it!

12:55.215 --> 12:57.450
I don't know if I should
ever use the Roar again.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.230
Never use the Roar again?

12:59.270 --> 13:02.570
Bunga! Shh!

13:02.600 --> 13:06.050
Tell me you're joking.
Never use the Roar again?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.200
You're joking, right?

13:08.230 --> 13:10.100
Bunga, I...

13:10.140 --> 13:12.850
Kion, you're the leader
of the Lion Guard.

13:12.890 --> 13:15.160
You're
the Pride Lands' fiercest!

13:15.190 --> 13:16.660
You gotta use the Roar!

13:16.690 --> 13:17.780
<i> Zuka Zama, right?</i>

13:19.320 --> 13:20.280
<i> Zuka Zama.</i>

13:21.310 --> 13:22.860
Sure.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.490
There ya go.
Glad I could help!

13:25.530 --> 13:29.150
Another problem solved
by Bunga the Wise.

13:29.190 --> 13:29.950
Now I'm gonna go help Ono!

13:35.780 --> 13:37.300
So...

13:37.340 --> 13:38.550
Kion's afraid
to use the Roar.

13:39.470 --> 13:40.690
Interesting.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.040
Looks like it's time
to make my move.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.480
You mean go back
to Big Springs?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.680
Who needs Big Springs

13:49.720 --> 13:52.560
when the whole Flood Plains
could be ours!

13:56.410 --> 13:57.360
Grandfather Mufasa?

14:00.190 --> 14:01.660
<i> Yes, Kion.</i>

14:01.700 --> 14:03.680
<i> I'm here.</i>

14:03.710 --> 14:06.060
I'm worried about the Roar.

14:06.090 --> 14:09.360
The last time I used it,
I was really angry.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.890
And it caused
so much destruction!

14:11.920 --> 14:14.870
<i> The Roar of the Elders
is very powerful.</i>

14:14.900 --> 14:16.770
I know.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.410
And that's why I'm thinking...

14:19.450 --> 14:21.710
I shouldn't use it again.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.520
I... I'm worried
that I might turn into Scar.

14:24.550 --> 14:27.850
<i> Scar cared only for himself.</i>

14:27.890 --> 14:30.290
<i> His selfishness
fueled his anger.</i>

14:30.320 --> 14:33.150
<i> Why were you angry, Kion?</i>

14:33.190 --> 14:35.000
Janja and the hyenas.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.190
They were attacking my mom.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.610
I was so mad at them
when I used the Roar!

14:39.640 --> 14:41.390
I lost control.

14:41.430 --> 14:43.450
And it almost hurt my mom.

14:43.490 --> 14:45.510
I almost hurt my mom!

14:45.550 --> 14:50.400
<i>Scar never cared for anyone
else the way you do, Kion.</i>

14:50.440 --> 14:53.092
<i>So perhaps you should speak with the one</i>

14:53.093 --> 14:54.860
<i>you care so much about.</i>

14:54.900 --> 14:57.920
Right.
I will.

14:57.950 --> 14:58.830
Thank you, Grandfather.

15:16.330 --> 15:19.730
The Flood Plains
belong to the crocodiles now!

15:27.110 --> 15:28.650
That's right, bushbucks!

15:28.680 --> 15:29.280
Leave!

15:32.990 --> 15:35.760
Now see here!

15:35.800 --> 15:37.640
I was drinking that!

15:38.930 --> 15:40.680
Oh, dear!

15:40.710 --> 15:42.550
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

15:44.890 --> 15:47.210
That's right, run!

15:47.240 --> 15:49.490
And tell all your friends.

15:49.520 --> 15:53.350
The Flood Plains now belong
to the crocodiles!

15:57.460 --> 15:58.230
Whoa!

16:00.500 --> 16:02.250
Hey, are you okay?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.880
Makuu and the crocs...

16:04.920 --> 16:06.800
They took over...

16:06.840 --> 16:10.740
- ...the Flood Plains.
- Makuu...

16:10.770 --> 16:13.830
Don't worry. The Lion Guard
will take care of this.

16:15.860 --> 16:18.120
Oh, I don't know about this, Bunga.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.220
Trust me.
Almost done.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.610
Just a little more off the top.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.240
<i> Poa!</i>

16:23.270 --> 16:24.340
It's a whole new look, Ono.

16:24.370 --> 16:28.121
- Is that good?
- Shh! I'm trying to get the sides even.

16:28.630 --> 16:29.710
There.

16:29.740 --> 16:34.160
Now let's see what I can do
about these tail feathers.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.690
- Guys!   - Have a seat.
Be with you in a minute.

16:35.730 --> 16:38.570
What is that?
Whatever.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.090
Listen! Makuu and his crocs
just took over the Flood Plains!

16:41.120 --> 16:42.950
He can't do that!

16:42.980 --> 16:45.020
A lot of animals
depend on those plains.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.930
Exactly.
We gotta get down there.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.160
Ono, find Kion, tell him to
meet us at the Flood Plains.

16:50.200 --> 16:50.950
Affirmative!

16:53.730 --> 16:54.990
Careful, Ono!

16:55.030 --> 16:56.890
That's a Bunga original!

17:06.010 --> 17:09.270
Someone's looking for trouble.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.810
All right, Makuu,
you've had your fun.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.150
Now it's time to leave.

17:14.180 --> 17:16.770
Get out,
or we'll throw you out.

17:16.810 --> 17:19.880
Without your fearless leader?

17:19.910 --> 17:22.349
Or... Or should I say,
your Roar-less leader?

17:23.710 --> 17:24.950
Hmm...

17:24.980 --> 17:27.740
Oh?
You didn't hear?

17:27.775 --> 17:32.380
Mighty Kion,
leader of the Lion Guard,

17:32.420 --> 17:36.420
too much of a coward
to use his Roar.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.170
I don't know what you're
talking about, Makuu.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.340
But if you think the Lion Guard
needs the Roar to defeat you,

17:41.370 --> 17:44.020
you're sadly mistaken.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.860
We'll see about that.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.070
I'll take Makuu.

17:52.110 --> 17:53.280
Think you two
can handle the rest?

17:53.320 --> 17:54.460
You know it, Fuli!

17:57.960 --> 17:59.620
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

17:59.650 --> 18:01.670
Take that!

18:01.700 --> 18:03.740
<i> Twende kiboko!</i>

18:26.140 --> 18:27.650
<i> Huwezi!</i>

18:31.350 --> 18:35.050
Told you we didn't need the
Roar to beat the likes of you.

18:35.090 --> 18:37.940
- Give up?
- "Give up"? Me?

18:37.970 --> 18:40.084
Oh, I don't think so.

18:44.820 --> 18:49.210
Did you think I'd try to take
over the whole Flood Plain

18:49.250 --> 18:54.090
- with only three crocodiles?
- I kinda did.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.240
And then I saw you
surrounded by hyenas

18:56.270 --> 18:59.960
and it made me so angry.

18:59.995 --> 19:02.180
I know I'm not supposed
to use the Roar in anger.

19:02.210 --> 19:04.210
But I did.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.510
And, and then...
I know, Kion.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.100
I was there.

19:08.140 --> 19:11.500
So, what I need to know is...

19:11.540 --> 19:13.510
Can you ever forgive me?

19:13.550 --> 19:17.050
Forgive you?
There's nothing to forgive.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.590
You were saving my life.

19:18.630 --> 19:22.650
But the Roar created that
earthquake. And you fell in!

19:22.680 --> 19:24.780
And you helped me out.

19:24.820 --> 19:26.980
I know, but...
Seeing you like that...

19:29.870 --> 19:33.340
Ever since, I've been
afraid to use the Roar.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.750
Kion, the Roar
is part of who you are.

19:37.790 --> 19:41.158
- You can't just stop using it.
- But how do you know

19:41.193 --> 19:44.020
I won't use it in anger
again and hurt someone?

19:44.060 --> 19:47.360
Because I know you.
I trust you.

19:47.390 --> 19:50.220
Kion! Kion!
It's Makuu!

19:50.250 --> 19:53.690
Makuu? What's he done this...
Uh, Ono?

19:53.720 --> 19:57.210
- What's on your head?
- It's a Bunga original.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.160
I'll explain on the way.
Follow me!

20:03.170 --> 20:07.020
Makuu!
These Flood Plains aren't yours!

20:07.050 --> 20:11.360
You're welcome to use them, as are
all the animals of the Pride Lands.

20:11.390 --> 20:15.110
And if you're not willing to
share, then it's time to leave.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.710
That's right!

20:16.750 --> 20:18.200
You heard Kion and Queen Nala!

20:18.240 --> 20:22.510
Clear out!
The Flood Plains don't belong to you!

20:22.540 --> 20:26.120
Sure looks like they do to me.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.580
We crocodiles
keep what we take.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.980
The Queen!
Mom!

20:36.920 --> 20:38.170
No.

20:38.210 --> 20:39.470
Not in anger.

20:40.790 --> 20:42.480
Makuu...

20:42.510 --> 20:44.010
What are you
going to do, Kion?

20:45.310 --> 20:47.090
Roar at me?

20:47.130 --> 20:48.630
And risk hurting your mom?

20:48.670 --> 20:49.640
Again?

20:53.150 --> 20:54.860
Kion, trust yourself.

21:00.010 --> 21:00.900
<i> Poa!</i>

21:07.930 --> 21:11.110
Next time
when I say go, you leave!

21:19.360 --> 21:22.700
That was un-Bunga-lievable!

21:22.740 --> 21:24.980
<i> Poa!
It sure was.</i>

21:25.010 --> 21:28.770
I didn't know you could
do that with the Roar, Kion.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.780
Neither did I.

21:29.810 --> 21:33.350
Guess I just had to have
a little faith in myself.

21:33.390 --> 21:34.400
I've always
had faith in you.

21:35.470 --> 21:38.000
Hey, guys! Look!

21:38.040 --> 21:39.720
Aw! You lost
your headpiece.

21:39.750 --> 21:40.990
I can make you another one.

21:41.020 --> 21:42.810
No need. Look!

21:42.840 --> 21:44.180
My feathers have
already started to grow back!

21:44.220 --> 21:47.250
I'll be back to looking like
a normal egret in no time!

21:47.290 --> 21:48.950
Ono!
Check it out!

21:51.060 --> 21:52.890
Look at that, Ono.

21:52.930 --> 21:56.050
- You started a trend!
- Oh!

21:56.090 --> 21:57.800
Well, I suppose I did.
