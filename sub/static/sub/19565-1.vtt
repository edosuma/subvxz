00:39.375 --> 00:40.750
Nordkapp!

01:54.958 --> 01:57.625
Nybakken has cholate!

01:57.708 --> 01:59.625
He is dead!

02:19.708 --> 02:21.500
He's my best friend ever.

02:21.583 --> 02:27.708
But like a true Viking, he deserves
a dignified farewell in this car.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.917
It's the least we can do
for Nybakken.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.083
And it...

02:37.125 --> 02:39.917
Nice trip then, mate.

03:17.542 --> 03:19.208
Hey!

03:20.542 --> 03:22.667
Mamma?

03:23.708 --> 03:26.000
Want a svele?

03:27.542 --> 03:31.000
My Boy ... Nybakken.

03:40.667 --> 03:44.750
Now you wake up. We will train.

03:46.583 --> 03:49.208
Shall we not eating a svele first, then?

04:48.667 --> 04:51.042
Doffen!

04:51.167 --> 04:54.750
Hey, Roy. There you are, yes.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.500
- Are you going to Nybakken, or?
- No, straight to work.

04:58.583 --> 05:01.792
Yes, you're supposed to start selling sausages.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.875
We have wasted
enough time here.

05:03.958 --> 05:06.417
Have you decided to become law-abiding?

05:06.500 --> 05:10.500
Yes, I think that Nina deserves a dad
which is where a little more.

05:10.583 --> 05:16.583
But ... Do not forget to health Nybakken
when you meet him.

05:16.667 --> 05:19.542
Stop tormenting yourself
with Nybakken-thing.

05:19.625 --> 05:23.458
He will be no less lame
that you have a bad conscience.

05:23.542 --> 05:27.417
Gundersen? Are you going
or I'll lock you up again?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.833
No no...

05:29.917 --> 05:34.917
- Hurry, Roy.
- Thanks!

05:55.833 --> 05:58.458
- Hey, pappa!
- Hello.

05:58.542 --> 06:01.750
Now I have really bad conscience.

06:01.833 --> 06:07.917
I had planned to come and meet you,
but as things got in the way. Sorry.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.583
Do not think about it. No problem.
I'll call when I have worked clear.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.417
- Great.
- Bye.

06:23.167 --> 06:28.583
You've come to Sylvia
voice mail. Leave a message.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.958
Welcome out, Gundersen.

06:39.417 --> 06:45.458
- Thanks. If you have little to do, right?
- Yes.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.375
Just what should I
lecture on in Sweden now.

06:49.458 --> 06:55.500
I will explain to my Nordic
colleagues how I-

06:55.583 --> 07:00.792
- Has received the speeding statistics
in Norway with 19.2% in two years.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.833
Okay...

07:04.792 --> 07:10.125
- Paja not the statistics for me.
- No.

07:13.417 --> 07:18.583
I think that our conversations
there have been ...

07:21.542 --> 07:24.625
Yes ... Fine.

07:27.208 --> 07:30.125
Do not mess it now.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.667
Hey!

07:48.750 --> 07:55.625
Grilling ... of coarse bread ...
with shrimp salad and cheese.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.333
No! I'll start working here today.

08:00.417 --> 08:03.333
- Roy Gundersen?
- Yes. Hello Hello!

08:03.417 --> 08:06.583
- My man, PetterN here.
- Okay, well ...

08:06.667 --> 08:10.083
Step into my office,
then you should get some training.

08:10.167 --> 08:16.583
You can start by jogging in time
a bacon grilled in lompe to me.

08:16.667 --> 08:22.083
With crispy fried onions, a splash of lemon
and a little tabasco.

08:22.167 --> 08:26.583
In early fuckar head with you
and says, "No, it is wienertajm."

08:26.667 --> 08:31.042
"Wiener! Wiener."

08:31.125 --> 08:36.750
And so, after a few years
disappears the voice in your head.

08:38.125 --> 08:44.207
- A grilled bacon.
- Obvious. Okay...

08:45.292 --> 08:47.958
Bye. See you tomorrow.

08:50.667 --> 08:55.875
You have come to
Sylvia's voice mail.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.750
- Come on! Follow here!
- In with him!

09:04.833 --> 09:07.042
Go! Go! Go!

09:23.250 --> 09:25.292
Come on!

09:57.042 --> 10:01.792
- I began to wonder where you got to.
- I was wondering the same thing about you.

10:08.333 --> 10:12.917
You seem to have taken advantage of
visiting hours in jail well.

10:49.667 --> 10:54.000
Clean mug circus.
Stylish and smart bunch.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.875
Particularly girls.
There beats IQ ceiling.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.250
- Dad!
- Did you know that?

11:10.333 --> 11:13.000
Finally!

11:21.958 --> 11:25.458
This Charlie, my dude.

11:25.542 --> 11:28.042
- Yes, hello.
- Dude, yes?

11:28.125 --> 11:31.333
- Nina says that you are the king.
- Yes that...

11:31.417 --> 11:33.875
You are the one who has run the toughest ever.

11:34.958 --> 11:37.500
- That's right.
- It was.
