WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:06.174
(car horn honks)

00:06.207 --> 00:08.209
(door unlocking)

00:09.810 --> 00:10.611
(clattering)

00:10.644 --> 00:11.579
(grunts)

00:11.612 --> 00:13.581
Ow. What the hell?

00:13.614 --> 00:14.815
(gun cocks)

00:14.848 --> 00:16.084
Someone there?

00:16.117 --> 00:17.218
What are you doing in here?

00:18.186 --> 00:19.019
(gunshot)

00:23.391 --> 00:24.558
(grunts)

00:27.095 --> 00:28.229
Come out with your hands up.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.666
(groans)

00:32.700 --> 00:34.068
FEMALE NEIGHBOR:
I'm calling 911!

00:34.102 --> 00:36.437
Anyone else?

00:39.173 --> 00:40.574
(McGee groaning)

00:40.608 --> 00:42.243
(dog barking in distance)

00:43.811 --> 00:45.146
Ow.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.192
Oh, God.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.767
(line rings)

01:06.800 --> 01:08.502
GIBBS:
Yeah, McGee.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.804
McGee, you there?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.173
McGee?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.541
I'm here, boss.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.677
I'm here.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.713
*

01:49.177 --> 01:52.380
(sighs): Naturally,
they all claim

01:52.413 --> 01:53.914
to fully support the bill,

01:53.947 --> 01:55.583
but this makes
three times now

01:55.616 --> 01:56.850
that they've postponed
a vote on it.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.319
Wow.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.188
Duplicitous backstabbers
on Capitol Hill.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.655
Who'd have thunk it?

02:01.689 --> 02:05.493
You've got plenty of it
in your world, too, Lee.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.161
You have the experience.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.330
Hey, you want to go to a
Wizards game with me next week?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.165
I can get us really good seats.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.900
Are you changing the subject?
Mm-hmm.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.168
I'm sorry,
it's just my aversion

02:14.202 --> 02:15.669
to talking politics over dinner.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.671
Makes everything
so very hard to swallow.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.806
We're not talking politics.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.174
I'm talking you.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.910
Since NCIS got rid of Kai Chen,

02:22.943 --> 02:24.912
your public profile's
never been higher.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.480
I have a public profile?

02:26.514 --> 02:28.616
Yes, you do.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.917
You're handsome,

02:29.950 --> 02:33.321
brilliant, charismatic.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.323
And to have a fighter like you
at our side,

02:35.356 --> 02:36.957
swimming with the sharks.
You know,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.460
I think I fare much better
on dry land.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.428
Come on, Lee.
Okay.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.695
I get it. I get it.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.930
And I'd... Yeah, I'd be lying

02:42.963 --> 02:46.300
if I didn't say
that I wasn't tempted.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.501
Can you see it?

02:47.535 --> 02:48.936
You take a seat
in Congress,

02:48.969 --> 02:50.971
and your buddy Gibbs gets a seat
in the director's chair.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.373
(chuckles)

02:52.406 --> 02:53.807
So you're planning
his future, too?

02:53.841 --> 02:56.377
(phone ringing)

02:56.410 --> 02:59.280
Oh. Speak of the devil.
Oh.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.681
Yeah, Gibbs.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.416
McGee was just attacked
by two armed assailants.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.784
He what?

03:03.817 --> 03:04.918
In his apartment.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.454
Is McGee all right?

03:06.487 --> 03:07.421
Agent McGee?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.262
Yes, I will do that, Leon.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.596
Just keeping you in the loop.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.997
Call you later.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.932
Ducky and Jimmy
are on their way.
McGee.

03:18.966 --> 03:19.967
There were two of them?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.703
Yeah. One of them got
away, but I grazed him.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.605
Check local hospitals
for recent gunshot wounds.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.606
TORRES:
No wallet.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.308
But a print scanner

03:27.341 --> 03:29.277
IDs him as Louis Cole,

03:29.310 --> 03:30.010
a recent parolee.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.479
No stolen goods on him.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.946
I wonder what the other guy
made out with.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.582
I don't even care.
I'm just happy

03:34.615 --> 03:36.317
that Delilah was in Dubai
on assignment.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.252
I mean, if she would've
walked in on these guys,

03:38.286 --> 03:39.953
would've been a lot worse.
You haven't called her yet?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.455
No. It's too early there.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.923
Plus, uh, I'm not
really looking forward

03:42.956 --> 03:43.891
to telling her anyway.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.926
Yeah, but she'll want to know
you're okay.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.329
That'll help, but it's not
gonna make her happy.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.897
I mean, it's bad enough
this place is trashed.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.333
It's gonna take a lot of
sage burning to make that okay.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.934
TORRES: Oh, she won't
mind too much, right?

03:53.967 --> 03:54.935
I'm sure she'll get over it
real quick.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.305
I mean, it's not like
it's the first dead body

03:57.338 --> 03:58.972
this apartment has seen.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.040
Wait, what?
GIBBS:
McGee.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.809
You know
what they were looking for?

04:01.842 --> 04:02.976
Uh, no, boss, I'll call Tony.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.346
Maybe he has some ideas.
QUINN:
Wait.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.348
Wait. Hold up. Go back.
What do you mean,

04:07.381 --> 04:09.016
it's not the first dead body?
Wait, you didn't know that?

04:09.049 --> 04:11.585
Triple homicide. It's how
Tony got the place so cheap.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.986
What? A triple homicide here?

04:13.020 --> 04:14.822
It was a long time ago.
Before Tony,

04:14.855 --> 04:17.358
the previous owner killed
three people.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.526
It was apparently
pretty messy.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.893
TORRES:
Pretty messy?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.429
Didn't the guy use
an electric carving knife

04:21.462 --> 04:22.696
to dismember the bodies?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.064
Right, guys, can we not?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.400
Oh, I could never live here
knowing that.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.868
Yeah, I had
the same reservations

04:27.901 --> 04:29.370
when I was in the running.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.504
More like the heebie-jeebies.

04:30.538 --> 04:31.772
How did Delilah feel about it?

04:31.805 --> 04:32.873
Actually,
I haven't told her yet.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.375
What? You never told Delilah?

04:34.408 --> 04:35.609
Well, I was going to tell her,

04:35.643 --> 04:37.345
but, you know,
we moved in,

04:37.378 --> 04:38.846
and what she doesn't know...

04:38.879 --> 04:39.880
Dude, that's messed up.
Come on.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.382
It was 15 years ago.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.550
There's got to be
an expiration date

04:42.583 --> 04:43.784
on the creepy factor.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.686
Besides, it's not like
the place is haunted.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.589
Hmm, maybe cursed.
It's not cursed.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.391
I'm counting
on each of you

04:50.424 --> 04:52.526
to please help me keep
my secret from Delilah.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.028
You want us to lie for you?
We can't lie to her, McGee.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.565
No, it's not a lie,
it's-it's more of a...

04:57.598 --> 04:59.066
It's like an omission.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.601
That's the word for it,
"omission."

05:00.634 --> 05:02.670
It's like if Delilah
were to say, "McGee,

05:02.703 --> 05:04.338
"has there ever been
a triple homicide

05:04.372 --> 05:06.707
in this apartment?"
and you said no,

05:06.740 --> 05:08.041
that would be a lie.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.477
That's right,
and she's never asked me that.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.379
Why the hell would she ask that?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.681
BISHOP:
Yeah, I got to say, Alex,

05:13.714 --> 05:16.116
I'm a little surprised
you seem okay with this.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.085
What? I'm-I'm not okay
with any of it,

05:18.118 --> 05:21.355
but sometimes secrets
are a necessary evil.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.457
Especially when
dealing with family.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.858
You have secrets in your family?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.661
I'll take that as a yes.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.062
Well, I'm in
too deep already,

05:29.096 --> 05:30.531
so please just don't
say anything to anyone.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.066
In fact, forget that
anything even happened.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.035
This triple homicide...
Ah, this is great.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.804
...we find out more,
see if there's a connection.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.906
Boss, I-I can't imagine
there's a connection.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.376
I mean, it's so many years
between incidents.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.877
Wait, Rosebud.

05:43.911 --> 05:44.912
Rosebud?

05:44.945 --> 05:48.382
Yeah, Rosebud is Delilah's
private hard drive.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.150
It's got every photo
and document on it

05:50.183 --> 05:52.820
from when she was a kid,
up until now.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.389
It's named after the sled
in Citizen Kane.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.890
It's her diary,
it's her everything.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.160
And it's gone.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.162
There anything else on
that, like DoD files?

06:02.195 --> 06:04.898
I can't imagine,
boss, but maybe.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.468
(phone ringing)

06:07.501 --> 06:09.102
It's her.
What's she doing up so early?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.938
QUINN:
Women have a sixth sense

06:10.971 --> 06:14.141
about this stuff.
Ask her what was in there.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.076
Boss, if I ask her about
the missing hard drive,

06:16.109 --> 06:17.478
she's gonna know everything.
Tell her everything, Tim.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.912
I won't tell her everything,
I'll talk to her

06:18.946 --> 06:20.414
about it tonight.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.749
(phone continues ringing)

06:21.782 --> 06:23.617
Or you could not
answer her call.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.118
No, no, answer it.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.454
Time to come clean, McGee.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.123
Hey, sweetheart.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.859
Early morning
for you, huh?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.494
Yeah.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.128
Oh, uh, I miss you, too.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.697
Um, me?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.965
Um, not much.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.166
(whispering):
Uh... not much?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.834
No, uh...

06:40.868 --> 06:42.636
No, pretty quiet,
actually, yeah.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.539
No, no, no, everything's
good-- a nice and, uh,

06:45.573 --> 06:46.840
quiet evening at home.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.985
Oh, I was hoping
you'd beat me here.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.887
Well, Gibbs wanted more details
on the triple homicide

06:59.920 --> 07:01.121
at McGee's place,

07:01.154 --> 07:02.956
and I just found a bunch.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.224
I was hoping
you'd say that, too.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.859
So, according to this

07:05.893 --> 07:08.161
old case file,
"Police responded to a call

07:08.195 --> 07:11.164
"about shots fired and found
the apartment's owner,

07:11.198 --> 07:14.034
"a licensed furrier
named Paul Triff,

07:14.067 --> 07:15.936
"dismembering the bodies

07:15.969 --> 07:17.805
"of three known felons

07:17.838 --> 07:19.540
with an electric carving knife."

07:19.573 --> 07:20.808
Ugh.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.042
Well, "Triff
pleaded self-defense

07:22.075 --> 07:23.644
"following a
home invasion,

07:23.677 --> 07:25.513
"but the jury sentenced him
to three life terms

07:25.546 --> 07:26.980
at Maryland Correctional."

07:27.014 --> 07:28.616
How bizarre is that?

07:28.649 --> 07:29.850
What I don't get is,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.018
who's a licensed furrier
anymore, anyway?

07:31.051 --> 07:33.086
Was that still a thing
15 years ago?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.555
Well, and why
dismember the bodies

07:34.588 --> 07:35.923
if he acted
in self-defense?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.258
I mean, that's got to be
the worst defense angle ever.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.728
There's got be some kind of
symmetry to all this, right?

07:40.761 --> 07:41.929
A home invasion,

07:41.962 --> 07:43.163
known felons,

07:43.196 --> 07:44.698
shot in the apartment.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.833
No, no symmetry at all.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.568
I studied
the case myself.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.570
Triff's furrier
business was a front

07:49.603 --> 07:51.004
for a
smuggling ring.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.507
The three home invaders
worked as furriers,

07:53.541 --> 07:54.942
presumably as smugglers.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.610
So why the dismembering?

07:56.644 --> 07:59.246
Well, he was sneaking out,
uh, body parts

07:59.279 --> 08:00.881
in plastic bags,
but, uh,

08:00.914 --> 08:02.950
that bears no resemblance
to last night.
TORRES: Yo.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.284
How much you tell Delilah?

08:04.317 --> 08:05.953
(scoffs)
Delilah was so freaked out

08:05.986 --> 08:07.555
by the break-in itself,

08:07.588 --> 08:08.956
I had to leave out the part
about killing a guy.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.291
Another lie?
It's not a lie, Nick,

08:11.324 --> 08:12.259
it's an omission.
Oh, right, right,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.728
it's, uh, "family."
Yeah, and it's Delilah.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.630
I mean, she was
gonna fly home as is.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.098
I had to, you know, cover,

08:18.131 --> 08:19.967
so I convinced her
to stay longer.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.234
Hopefully long enough to where

08:21.268 --> 08:22.836
I can get the walls
and the floors fixed.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.237
You didn't tell her that either?
Again,

08:24.271 --> 08:26.039
why would I pile on
the bad news?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.976
Yeah, so no reason to tell her
about a... triple homicide?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.979
No, no, Torres, that's a secret,
we can't do that, all right?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.647
We just need to find
this hard drive.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.048
Rosebud-- is that
what they were after?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.316
Think so, boss.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.318
Called Tony,
he had no other ideas.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.988
Okay, what do we know? Update.
All right.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.857
Our dead burglar,
Louis Cole, 37,

08:43.891 --> 08:46.794
was paroled two months ago from
Haynesville Correctional Center

08:46.827 --> 08:49.162
after serving three years
for transporting narcotics.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.798
QUINN:
Drug offenses,

08:50.831 --> 08:53.300
a few assaults, but no
burglaries on his rap sheet.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.102
First time for everything.
TORRES:
We collected evidence.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.170
Found a crowbar
in the bedroom.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.305
Abby's running it
for prints now.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.840
Boss, we got to find these guys.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.041
Beyond
sentimental value,

09:01.074 --> 09:02.943
Delilah's whole life
is on that hard drive.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.945
If she finds out it's missing...
TORRES:
What?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.213
You didn't tell her
about Rosebud?
Why would I

09:06.246 --> 09:08.148
if there's still a chance
I could get it back?

09:08.181 --> 09:11.585
Yet another lie.
Not a lie-- omission.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.086
Yeah, Duck,
I'm on my way.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.725
To me, honesty is all
about the three yous.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.159
"The three yous,"
Doctor?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.261
Yeah, well, there's the
you that the world knows,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.631
there's the you that your
friends and family know,

09:23.664 --> 09:26.033
and there's the you
that only you know.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.802
And that you most
certainly has secrets.

09:28.836 --> 09:32.139
Ah, but is the secret
the same as a lie?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.707
Oh, great,
you know, too?

09:33.741 --> 09:35.242
Oh, sorry, McGee,

09:35.275 --> 09:37.878
yeah, I overheard the others at
the crime scene talking about it

09:37.911 --> 09:39.780
when we went to go
pick up the body.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.182
Now, I know it's not my place
to offer up my opinion, but...

09:42.215 --> 09:43.951
You're going to anyway.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.819
I just feel like a triple
homicide is something

09:45.853 --> 09:48.121
that I'd have to tell Breena
about before we moved in.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.090
But you're not moving in.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.625
And you are not gonna
tell Delilah.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.226
JIMMY: What? No, no,
no, of course not.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.228
I wouldn't dream of it.
Ducky, what we got?

09:55.262 --> 09:57.631
DUCKY: I thought you'd never
ask, Jethro. (chuckles)

09:57.665 --> 09:59.066
And, Timothy,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.668
your intruder died

10:00.701 --> 10:03.303
from a single well-placed
bullet to the heart.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.072
I was just firing back, Ducky.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.974
It was a lucky shot at best.

10:07.007 --> 10:07.941
And at worst,

10:07.975 --> 10:11.244
that apartment of yours
is decidedly unlucky.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
Hi, Abbs.
McGee.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.648
Ugh.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.817
I'm so glad you're okay.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.085
Tony never should've
bought that place,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.219
no matter how cheap it was.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.688
Look, it's not unlucky,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.089
it's two incidents
15 years apart.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.224
Incidents? You call
those incidents?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.860
The shootings
and the dismemberments?

10:26.894 --> 10:28.862
GIBBS:
Abby, what do you got?

10:28.896 --> 10:31.865
I thought he'd never ask.
ABBY:
I got a positive match

10:31.899 --> 10:33.233
off the fingerprint
on the crowbar.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.268
It belongs to a Walter Shibberd.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.038
He has got multiple
burglaries on his rap sheet,

10:38.071 --> 10:39.139
and I sent you his
cell phone number

10:39.172 --> 10:40.207
in case you want to ping it.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.208
Good work.
You're the best, Abbs.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.242
Oh, McGee?

10:42.275 --> 10:43.443
It's too late
to tell Delilah

10:43.476 --> 10:45.045
about the apartment.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.880
If it were me,
I would not want to know.

10:46.914 --> 10:47.915
Okay.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.685
(chuckles)

10:56.890 --> 10:59.426
According to this, we should be
right on top of him.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.330
Hey, Walter.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.298
Seems like you got
a boo-boo there.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.967
McGEE:
I know it was dark,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.401
but I'm pretty sure
we met last night.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.103
He's running,
he's running.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.172
Ooh, I was hoping you did that.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.043
(grunts)

11:16.076 --> 11:18.678
Ooh, make that
two boo-boos.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.951
All right,
let's see what we got.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.287
.22-caliber semiauto.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.223
(chuckles)
My Lincoln penny collection.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.259
Ah.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.327
Rosebud?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.400
I'd never
been shot before.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.235
I was afraid
to go to the E.R.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.304
I hear that's where
you guys always look.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.239
What made you want this?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.341
What do you mean?
It was there.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.243
I was gonna sell it,
like everything else.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.280
I'm a B and E man. I'm a...
I'm a hired hand. That's all.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.915
Working for who?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.216
This guy Louis.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.851
I met him
at a bar last week.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.252
Said if I broke him
into the apartment,

11:59.286 --> 12:01.021
he'd pay me 500 bucks,

12:01.054 --> 12:02.890
plus anything else
I wanted to keep.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.191
This guy Louis,

12:04.224 --> 12:06.059
what was he looking for?
I don't know.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.327
He said he'd know it
when he saw it.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.062
It had something to do
with a hot tip

12:09.096 --> 12:10.430
he got from a buddy
in the joint.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.406
Whatever that tip was,
this fellow Louis thought

12:19.439 --> 12:22.242
it was worth tearing up McGee's
entire apartment to find it.
But we don't

12:22.275 --> 12:25.045
have to tear it up, do we?
'Cause McGee will not like that.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.279
Okay.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.915
Then find a way
to search his apartment

12:27.948 --> 12:29.850
without destroying it.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.785
I can do that.

12:31.819 --> 12:32.953
(phone ringing)

12:36.523 --> 12:38.391
Congresswoman Flemming.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.060
Hello, handsome.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.030
I'm just calling
to see how McGee is doing.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.098
He's doing very well.
Caught the other burglar

12:45.132 --> 12:47.267
and he's recovering
stolen property as we speak.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.401
So how's your lovely day?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.037
Ma'am.
That is wonderful news.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.272
Please give Agent McGee
my regards.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.142
I take it
you're no longer alone.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.509
That is very true.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.345
Um, on another note,

12:58.378 --> 12:59.847
about our lunch meeting
tomorrow,

12:59.880 --> 13:02.983
I was hoping to change venues.
Oh, sure.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.352
For a minute there, I thought
you were gonna cancel on me.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.353
You know Dasher's?

13:06.386 --> 13:08.822
Yes, I know it well.

13:08.856 --> 13:12.059
I also know it's a favorite
of the power lunch crowd,

13:12.092 --> 13:14.227
eager to see and be seen.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.129
Nothing wrong with that,
is there?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.965
For an up-and-comer like me?

13:17.998 --> 13:19.132
Well, that's the spirit.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.333
Plus, it's closer to my office.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.369
I've got a packed day tomorrow.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.204
I really do appreciate it,
Director.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.372
Uh-huh.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.140
Uh-huh.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.375
What can we do?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.609
Well, hop on board.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.344
We're all combing
the same database.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.847
Checking inmate profiles for
any of Louis' prison buddies.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.415
BISHOP: And any possible
links between Louis

13:35.448 --> 13:37.017
and your
Electric Carving Knife Man.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.318
He's not
my anything,

13:38.351 --> 13:39.352
and there is no link, okay?

13:39.386 --> 13:40.520
Chances are one in a million.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.990
QUINN:
Ooh, I found Louis' cellmate.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.557
Okay, put it up.
All right,

13:44.591 --> 13:46.193
his name
is Joe Berk, 53,

13:46.226 --> 13:49.062
serving 15 years
for running a Ponzi scheme.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.031
TORRES: Seems like a
medium-security case.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.432
Don't see any tie-in
to your apartment.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.434
See, no connection
to Triff.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.269
What was Louis' work detail?
Uh, according to this,

13:56.303 --> 13:58.138
he worked the prison kitchen
doing meal prep.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.140
Must've done it well.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.841
Worked his way up
to inmate supervisor and...

14:03.376 --> 14:04.277
Uh-oh.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.113
Uh-oh?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.248
You see it, too?

14:08.281 --> 14:09.649
You go first. You can tell him.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.919
Wait, tell who? Tell me?
Tell him what?

14:11.952 --> 14:15.155
Well, it seems Louis was so good
at kitchen work

14:15.188 --> 14:19.492
that he was sent to other
prisons to train inmates.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.328
And last year he spent
two months training inmates

14:21.361 --> 14:23.430
at Maryland Correctional.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.098
Wait, isn't that where
the Electric Carving Guy

14:25.132 --> 14:26.433
is locked up?
GIBBS: Triff.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.567
What was his work detail?

14:27.600 --> 14:28.568
Paul Triff.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.437
Inmate at Maryland Correctional.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.173
Kitchen detail. Food prep.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.507
So he and Louis
had contact.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.943
Maybe even... buddies?

14:35.976 --> 14:37.510
QUINN: Either way,
there's a connection.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.178
Sorry, McGee.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.380
Talk about one
in a million.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.649
Yeah, I don't really see how
you can't tell Delilah now.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.451
That's the least of
it. If this is tied

14:44.484 --> 14:45.986
to that triple
homicide, suddenly

14:46.019 --> 14:48.922
living there feels
a lot more dangerous.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.968
(sighs)

15:03.136 --> 15:04.671
You nervous?

15:04.704 --> 15:08.541
Why? We deal with killers
all the time.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.544
Granted, this killer was living
in my apartment.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.081
Cooked in
my kitchen,

15:14.114 --> 15:15.548
used my bathrooms.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.217
Was in my closet.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.685
Did you know
that when they found him,

15:18.718 --> 15:22.189
he was completely soaked
in blood from head to toe.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.957
I mean, cops barely could
tell that he was human.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.125
They said
he looked more like Satan.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.659
Well,
if you do ever tell Delilah,

15:26.693 --> 15:29.362
you should probably
leave that out.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.698
Well, I appreciate you
having my back on,

15:31.731 --> 15:34.034
you know, all my omissions.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.370
Every family has secrets.
No one's immune.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.206
MAN:
Opening three.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.940
(lock buzzes)

15:43.443 --> 15:46.146
Well, hello.
I'm Paul.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.214
We know.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.116
(chuckles)

15:49.149 --> 15:49.983
(lock buzzes)

15:50.017 --> 15:52.619
We're from NCIS.
I'm Special Agent McGee,

15:52.652 --> 15:54.221
this is
Special Agent Quinn.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.622
NCIS?

15:55.655 --> 15:56.689
Is that, uh, Navy, Marines?

15:56.723 --> 15:58.125
McGEE:
Usually,

15:58.158 --> 15:59.993
yeah, but we're here
to talk to you today

16:00.027 --> 16:01.494
about Louis Cole.
Louis.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.764
Oh. Kitchen Louis. Hmm?

16:04.797 --> 16:09.269
Man could make chipped beef
taste like prime rib. Hmm?

16:09.302 --> 16:13.306
What is he, still doing
easy time over in Haynesville?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.175
He's dead.
Oh.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.209
Well, don't look at me.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.446
(laughs)
I'm sorry.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.081
Been here too long.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.150
That's terrible.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.285
So what happened?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.187
(clears throat)

16:27.220 --> 16:30.090
He broke into
your old apartment yesterday.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.724
He was looking
for something specific.

16:31.758 --> 16:35.295
And I...
the current occupant shot him.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.069
Wait, wait, no, I'm sorry.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.670
You?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.172
The current occupant?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.408
That's right, me.

16:48.441 --> 16:52.045
(laughs)

16:53.480 --> 16:56.749
Oh, well...
well, how 'bout that?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.285
Huh? My old apartment.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.253
Hey, are my bookshelves
still there?

17:00.287 --> 17:02.789
I put those in myself.
You know, I'm quite handy.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.191
QUINN:
Handy?

17:04.224 --> 17:06.126
That's a great word for it.
Yeah.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.628
Crown moldings,
all the little details,

17:08.661 --> 17:09.896
that's all me. Yeah.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.465
It's a great neighborhood, too.
I would still be living there

17:12.499 --> 17:14.267
if not for that crazy night.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.303
That crazy night you carved up
all your friends

17:16.336 --> 17:17.770
in my living room?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.179
Beaver.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.149
Excuse me?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.218
You'd look great in beaver.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.320
You know,
I had a beaver bomber jacket

17:33.353 --> 17:35.188
on my old
showroom floor.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.825
Huh? You'd love it. And you.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.460
Oh, my.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.862
Wow.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.199
A beauty like you,
you deserve chinchilla.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.568
Well, m-maybe fox.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.869
No thanks.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.671
Fur is murder.
Oh,

17:51.704 --> 17:53.740
you bet it is.
Okay.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.208
What tip did you give Louis?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.676
What could he have been
looking for?

17:56.709 --> 17:58.111
Tip? How would I know?

17:58.145 --> 17:59.879
Listen,
we talked about cooking,

17:59.912 --> 18:01.681
sports.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.717
I mean, I certainly never
let him know where I lived.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.586
Well, he tore up the walls
and floors for some reason.

18:06.619 --> 18:10.623
No, not my hardwoods.
I put those in, too.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.624
What did you put under them?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.260
Nothing. Oh.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.628
Mm... mm...

18:15.662 --> 18:17.364
nothing.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.899
Okay, so you're
saying that Louis

18:19.932 --> 18:22.269
came and burglarized
your old apartment and

18:22.302 --> 18:23.102
you have no idea...?

18:23.136 --> 18:25.338
It really is
an amazing coincidence,

18:25.372 --> 18:26.306
I will give you that.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.774
Rule 39.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.278
Does that nice lady
still live above us?

18:31.311 --> 18:32.712
The one with the yappy dog?

18:32.745 --> 18:34.181
Oh, that dog

18:34.214 --> 18:35.548
would make one good mitten,
baby.

18:35.582 --> 18:39.286
Ah. It's almost like
we're roommates, isn't it?

18:41.488 --> 18:44.224
ABBY:
Metal, plastic...

18:45.292 --> 18:50.197
Metal, wood, metal...

18:50.230 --> 18:51.398
You got a lot of metal.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.365
Paper clips mostly.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.900
Pretty cool, Abb.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.368
What's cool?

18:55.402 --> 18:57.404
This supercool
x-ray scanner.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.506
You wanted me
to find a way

18:59.539 --> 19:00.873
to search McGee's apartment
without tearing it up,

19:00.907 --> 19:02.342
and I found it.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.510
Well, find some more,
we can all pitch in.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.678
Thank you.
Well, maybe not all of us.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.915
I got through to Louis Cole's
parole officer; he says

19:08.948 --> 19:11.551
he's staying at a halfway house
for ex-cons in Fairfax.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.353
Well, that's a perfect
place to find friends.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.422
Who maybe know
what Louis was after.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.155
Okay, Bishop, you're with me.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.557
You two go to
McGee's place.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.393
Tell Quinn and McGee
to meet you there.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.404
Hey, excuse me. Miss?

19:31.438 --> 19:32.639
Hang on.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.408
Hands full.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.276
(soda cans rattle)

19:36.309 --> 19:39.246
These guys go through
a lot of soda.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.448
What can I do for you?

19:41.481 --> 19:45.285
NCIS Special Agents
Bishop and Gibbs.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.355
A parolee, Louis Cole.
He staying here?

19:48.388 --> 19:51.224
Uh, yeah, room 214.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.959
Though I haven't seen
him around today.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.495
He's not in any trouble, is he?

19:58.465 --> 20:02.402
Louis wasn't here very long.
I just can't believe he's gone.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.438
What happened exactly?

20:06.473 --> 20:08.775
Did you know
Louis well?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.643
(mutters)
Hardly at all,

20:10.677 --> 20:13.313
but compared to some that
we get here, he seemed like

20:13.346 --> 20:15.315
a pretty nice guy.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.416
You know,

20:16.449 --> 20:18.351
he'd say good morning,
stuff like that.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.486
Hey, any idea who this is?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.255
Um, I couldn't
tell you.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.624
He might've had
a daughter somewhere.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.293
We have 32 residents.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.396
Most of them have
a long-lost somebody.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.332
Did anyone here know Louis well?
He have any friends?

20:32.365 --> 20:36.336
Not good ones,
but y-you can ask around.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.837
These guys mostly
keep to themselves.

20:37.870 --> 20:41.408
I try to make it a point
not to get too involved, either.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.475
So you're not a counselor?

20:42.509 --> 20:45.278
Me? No.
I-I just manage the office.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.414
Though, believe me,

20:47.447 --> 20:50.417
every parolee that walks through
here wants more out of me,

20:50.450 --> 20:51.518
if you know what I mean.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.388
But I am done saving souls.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.025
QUINN:
Hey.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.727
You guys still at it?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.863
Yeah, almost done.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.366
How did it go
with the psycho furrier?

21:06.399 --> 21:07.600
Oh, he's definitely psycho.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.036
He's also a really bad liar.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.037
Did he lie or
did he omit?

21:11.070 --> 21:13.406
Oh, he did it all
and we didn't buy a word.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.907
There is no way
he didn't tell Louis

21:14.941 --> 21:16.509
that something valuable
was hidden here.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.078
Well, we have scanned
almost every inch of this place

21:19.111 --> 21:21.614
and it's nothing
but pipes and wires.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.783
TORRES: Yeah, the only place
we haven't checked is, uh,

21:23.816 --> 21:25.518
underneath your bed.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.653
My bed?

21:27.754 --> 21:29.756
Oh, uh, we
can step out

21:29.789 --> 21:32.625
if there's something under there
that you want to keep private.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.428
Like a secret, maybe?

21:35.462 --> 21:36.262
So I have to lift my bed

21:36.295 --> 21:37.930
to prove that I have
nothing to hide?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.466
Yes.
Yes.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.434
Yeah.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.835
Okay, let's do it.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.341
(both grunting)

21:50.843 --> 21:52.845
No secrets, huh?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.584
Comic books?

21:57.617 --> 21:59.586
Aw, there's nothing to be
ashamed of with comic books.

21:59.619 --> 22:00.720
McGEE:
And those are Delilah's.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.689
You guys are the perfect couple.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.057
Wh-What's in the box?
Oh, uh...

22:05.091 --> 22:07.494
ABBY:
Is that your dad's ashes?
Yeah, how'd you know?

22:07.527 --> 22:09.629
'Cause I went with you
to pick them up.
Yeah, he wanted 'em

22:09.662 --> 22:11.498
scattered at Monterey,
we just... we haven't quite

22:11.531 --> 22:13.666
gotten around to getting
out there yet, you know?

22:13.700 --> 22:16.669
So you store him under your bed?

22:16.703 --> 22:18.538
Well, it's as safe
a place as any.

22:18.571 --> 22:22.475
Delilah's okay with, uh,
sleeping and doing other things

22:22.509 --> 22:24.411
above your father's ashes?

22:24.444 --> 22:25.878
You're assuming she knows.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.847
She knows.
And she's fine with it, okay?

22:27.880 --> 22:31.017
Besides, it's-it's not my actual
father, it's his ashes.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.719
And they're not
directly under us.

22:32.752 --> 22:36.022
Well, something definitely is.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.394
And it's not pipes and wires.

22:41.428 --> 22:42.762
And it's big.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.163
It's a treasure.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.898
I knew it.
It's a treasure chest!

22:45.932 --> 22:47.834
Only one way
to find out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.702
Uh, let me do that,
let me do that. Come on.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.805
Okay.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.373
No, McGee, let me do it.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.619
(grunts)

23:06.653 --> 23:08.655
Well, moment of truth.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.857
All right,
let me record this.
Oh, just do it.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.564
Oh.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.469
Is that what I think it is?

23:22.502 --> 23:25.472
Suddenly your dad's ashes
doesn't seem so bad.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.540
ABBY:
McGee, are you okay?

23:27.574 --> 23:29.509
Say something, McGee.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.544
(phone rings)

23:38.551 --> 23:40.553
(hoarse): I'm gonna let that
go to voice mail.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.932
Now this is indeed
one for the books.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.200
Yeah.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.735
Ripley's Believe It or Not!

23:55.768 --> 23:57.470
Seeing is believing.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.205
Apparently the body's proximity

23:59.238 --> 24:02.241
to these ventilation ducts
beneath the floor

24:02.274 --> 24:06.045
provided the ideal conditions
for mummification.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.214
He's wearing a
St. Christopher medal.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.517
The patron saint of traveling?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.051
How's that for irony?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.253
Any guess on how long
he's been under there?

24:14.286 --> 24:15.522
Well, that's very
hard, Jethro.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.956
(phone ringing)

24:16.989 --> 24:19.458
But we'll know that and
more when we get him back.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.197
McGEE:
No, everything's good, Dee.

24:25.231 --> 24:28.501
Everything's good. Just, uh,
been busy, you know, with work.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.236
(mouths)
Lot of work lately.
Um, actually,

24:30.269 --> 24:31.938
you know,
I've been so busy that

24:31.971 --> 24:33.906
if you want
to take a few days to,

24:33.940 --> 24:36.108
you know, just go and explore,
relax a little bit,

24:36.142 --> 24:37.644
absolutely, now would be
a great time for that.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.812
What are you doing?
Delilah shouldn't know.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.549
What?
They've been sleeping
on a grave.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.016
Yeah, and not just sleeping,
that part we got.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.218
But what happened to
"You can't be lying, bro"?

24:46.252 --> 24:48.821
Well, this he can lie about.
Hypocrisy much?

24:48.855 --> 24:50.256
No, it's not hypocrisy.
This is different.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.758
That is so not different.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.192
Yes, it is different.
He knew about

24:53.225 --> 24:55.094
a triple homicide
before he moved in.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.163
This, he didn't know about.
And now that he knows,

24:57.196 --> 24:58.565
why shouldn't Delilah know?

24:58.598 --> 24:59.766
No... Nobody should know.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.000
I wish I didn't know.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.535
What about you,

25:02.569 --> 25:04.604
Mrs. Secrets and Lies?
Me? What about me?

25:04.637 --> 25:06.773
I have stayed the same
through this whole thing.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.941
If it was me, I wouldn't
want to know anything.

25:10.643 --> 25:11.844
You didn't
tell her, right?

25:11.878 --> 25:13.913
No.
You okay?

25:13.946 --> 25:15.548
This is really happening, right?

25:15.582 --> 25:17.550
There's a dead body
in-in my bedroom?

25:17.584 --> 25:18.885
Afraid so.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.753
Okay, thanks, just checking.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.558
(horn blows, birds squawk)

25:25.592 --> 25:27.594
Morning, Duck.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.061
Is it morning already?
(short chuckle)

25:29.095 --> 25:30.863
How time flies
when one has

25:30.897 --> 25:33.199
a bio-anthropological
phenomenon on one's table.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.701
Yeah?

25:34.734 --> 25:36.636
I thought it was just
an old dead guy.

25:36.669 --> 25:39.238
Well, he's not old, Jethro.
I'd put him in his 40s.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.208
Dr. Palmer is
pursuing identification

25:42.241 --> 25:44.276
from a rehydrated finger.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.212
You got a cause of death?
It's either

25:46.245 --> 25:49.181
this blunt force injury
to the parietal bone

25:49.215 --> 25:51.217
or a severed
carotid artery.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.986
The killer, whom we all
assume is this madman Triff,

25:54.020 --> 25:56.188
was, well, quite thorough.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.990
No ballpark on how long ago
he was killed?

25:58.024 --> 26:00.159
Well, mummification
makes that quite tricky.

26:00.192 --> 26:03.195
But, if I must, I'd ballpark it

26:03.229 --> 26:05.998
between ten and 15 years ago.

26:06.032 --> 26:09.168
Nice ballparking, Doctor.
It's 15 years, to be exact.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.037
How do you know that?
'Cause that's when he
disappeared. ID just came back

26:11.070 --> 26:12.304
as Logan Pruitt,

26:12.338 --> 26:15.041
first reported
missing in 2002.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.377
Pruitt.
That crooked lobbyist guy?

26:18.410 --> 26:21.380
Yes, I seem to recall that name.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.015
JIMMY:
W-What is this here, Doctor?

26:23.049 --> 26:25.351
Something in his stomach.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.119
Ah, something indeed.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.194
Desiccated skin
is very resilient.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.230
(grunts)

26:41.433 --> 26:43.002
Is that a key?

26:43.035 --> 26:44.671
Badly corroded.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.139
He must have
swallowed it before he died.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.909
Ow. Who would swallow a key?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.343
Go. Get it to Abby.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.248
VANCE:
Logan Pruitt.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.984
One of the most
notorious fugitives

26:58.017 --> 27:00.687
since D.B. Cooper,
and we found him?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.420
Found him under my bed.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.822
I cannot imagine
that experience,

27:02.855 --> 27:04.824
Agent McGee, but
there's no telling

27:04.857 --> 27:05.992
where this discovery might lead.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.293
I'm sorry. I may have been out
of the country for too long,

27:07.326 --> 27:10.429
but am I the only one
who doesn't know who
this Logan Pruitt is?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.131
I'll gonna leave the rest
of you to fill him in. Gibbs?

27:12.164 --> 27:13.833
Keep me filled in, too.
I've got a lunch meeting.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.669
Pruitt was a high-
powered lobbyist

27:16.703 --> 27:20.740
for South African exports and
a major player on Capitol Hill.

27:20.773 --> 27:21.874
QUINN: That was until
the Pretoria Heist.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.109
Oh, that I'd heard of.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.811
Millions in African diamonds

27:24.844 --> 27:26.713
stolen from a cargo plane
in Dulles.

27:26.746 --> 27:27.814
BISHOP:
Chartered the plane,

27:27.847 --> 27:29.381
which made him
an instant suspect,

27:29.415 --> 27:31.050
but the FBI could
never prove it.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.284
QUINN: When he disappeared
two months later,

27:32.318 --> 27:33.953
everyone just assumed

27:33.986 --> 27:35.722
that he, he just left
the country with all the loot.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.123
But now we know he was...

27:37.156 --> 27:39.191
McGEE:
That he was under my bed.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.227
You gonna be okay over there,
McGee?

27:41.260 --> 27:43.395
Yeah, working on it.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.864
Yeah, work faster.
I need you focused.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.699
Okay. I am. I'm done.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.434
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.
Okay, first of all,

27:48.467 --> 27:51.771
how crazy that Logan Pruitt
was underneath McGee's bed?

27:51.804 --> 27:54.240
Abby, you trace the key?

27:54.273 --> 27:56.408
I'm getting there. The, uh,
serial number was burned off

27:56.442 --> 27:58.077
by the stomach acid.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.212
But this bigger number
here is quite clear.

28:00.246 --> 28:03.716
Two-zero-three.
Could be a safe or a locker.

28:03.750 --> 28:04.616
Safety deposit box?

28:04.650 --> 28:06.085
Could be. I mean,
it's the right size.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.286
Are we suddenly
on the trail

28:07.319 --> 28:08.487
of the Pretoria diamonds?

28:08.520 --> 28:11.991
You see? A buried treasure.
I knew it.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.292
Come on, McGee.
Let's go find 'em.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.326
FLEMMING: Good news?
VANCE: Mm.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.762
That's amazing.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.063
If your agency solves

28:17.096 --> 28:18.998
the Pretoria Heist,

28:19.031 --> 28:20.499
you're a made man.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.835
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.437
I remember Pruitt trolling
the halls of Congress

28:25.471 --> 28:26.973
my first year on the Hill.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.775
He definitely gave off
a slippery vibe.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.176
MAN:
How are you, Jenna?

28:30.209 --> 28:31.277
Hello, Pete.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.779
Congressman Peter Shaw,

28:32.812 --> 28:34.981
uh, NCIS Director Leon Vance.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.448
Congressman, it's a pleasure.

28:36.482 --> 28:37.817
Pete, please.
Rock stars like you

28:37.850 --> 28:39.185
get to skip all the formalities.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.854
Jenna has nothing
but high praise, Leon.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.223
Is it true you're considering
joining our humble ranks?

28:44.256 --> 28:45.491
Considering might be
a little strong.

28:45.524 --> 28:48.360
Um, pondering might be
a little more accurate.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.429
Parsing words like
a born public servant.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.398
You might be
a natural.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.533
Uh, hey, Pete, did you ever
happen to cross paths

28:54.566 --> 28:55.401
with Logan Pruitt?

28:55.434 --> 28:57.536
Yeesh. There's a blast
from the past.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.371
And not a good one.
Why do you ask?

28:59.405 --> 29:00.539
Uh, we were just marveling

29:00.572 --> 29:02.274
that no one ever caught him,
did they?

29:02.308 --> 29:05.377
Well, whatever tropical island
he bought with his riches,

29:05.411 --> 29:07.013
let's hope
it has an active volcano.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.415
(laughter)

29:09.448 --> 29:11.517
Let's do lunch sometime, Leon.
I'll see you around campus.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.885
Pete, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.091
Scared me there.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.459
Thought you were
about to spill the beans.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.029
You know I'd never.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.031
But when the Pruitt news
gets out,

29:25.064 --> 29:26.565
the media's gonna be
all over it.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.835
And you.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.838
(lock buzzes)

29:38.277 --> 29:40.279
Bummer.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.148
I shaved and everything.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.382
Huh?

29:43.415 --> 29:45.051
(scoffs)

29:45.084 --> 29:46.452
Where's Chinchilla?

29:46.485 --> 29:48.087
She was delicious.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.555
Found your buddy, Pruitt.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.958
Ooh. You must be
the big gun, huh?

29:51.991 --> 29:54.293
Yeah. Silver fox,

29:54.326 --> 29:55.561
little bit too obvious.

29:55.594 --> 29:58.330
I'd put you
in mid-length coyote.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.333
You buried him under my floor.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.235
No, why would I do that?

30:03.269 --> 30:04.136
You tell us.

30:04.170 --> 30:07.039
Well, I'm sorry.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.041
I'm going to at least
need to know

30:09.075 --> 30:11.110
that you have
some kind of a theory.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.446
How's this? Pruitt knew about
your bogus furrier business

30:14.480 --> 30:16.983
and needed a partner
to intercept a shipment.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.550
You sent three goons
to steal the diamonds,

30:18.584 --> 30:20.452
deliver them to Pruitt
for safekeeping.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.354
(chuckles)
Well,

30:22.388 --> 30:24.957
I wish I had popcorn.
You guys are good.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.293
Then you killed Pruitt, but
the only reason we can think of

30:27.326 --> 30:28.961
is a liar like you

30:28.995 --> 30:30.496
had no intention
of honoring

30:30.529 --> 30:32.464
their partnership to begin with.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.903
That's not true.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.237
Let me tell you
something.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.007
I'm a lot of things,
but I am no liar.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.476
The plan was to sit
on the diamonds for a few years,

30:44.510 --> 30:46.145
until the heat died down,

30:46.178 --> 30:48.447
and it was Pruitt
that didn't honor that.

30:48.480 --> 30:52.484
I mean, you know,
he bought himself a condo.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.887
I mean, started picking up
the tab for senators

30:54.921 --> 30:56.222
like he's Sinatra.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.257
So you wanted to meet
at your place

30:58.290 --> 31:01.027
and demanded a key
to the safe deposit box.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.095
Son of a bitch swallowed it
right in front of me.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.630
I mean, he actually used
the words,

31:04.663 --> 31:06.933
"Over my dead body."

31:06.966 --> 31:10.069
How could I not oblige him?

31:10.102 --> 31:11.370
So you couldn't have
cut the key out of him

31:11.403 --> 31:12.571
like you cut up the other three?

31:12.604 --> 31:14.406
This was weeks
before all of that.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.043
All right? I was just making it
up as I went along.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.345
All I knew
was that I had a key

31:19.378 --> 31:22.014
that I needed to hide
for a few years.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.650
I had a body
that I needed to dispose of,

31:24.683 --> 31:29.388
and my floors
were almost finished.

31:29.421 --> 31:30.923
Hmm?

31:30.957 --> 31:32.191
What would you do?

31:32.224 --> 31:34.126
Maybe not kill anyone
to begin with?

31:34.160 --> 31:35.427
What about the other three?

31:35.461 --> 31:37.596
By the time they came
looking for the money,

31:37.629 --> 31:39.298
the floors were down.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.434
And they were beautiful, right?

31:42.468 --> 31:44.503
So you broke out the electric
carving knife instead.

31:44.536 --> 31:45.938
I mean, I tried to put down
plastic, but blood,

31:45.972 --> 31:47.273
it just really gets around.

31:47.306 --> 31:48.607
So all these years later,
you decide

31:48.640 --> 31:50.276
to tell Louis about it?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.478
Well, I'm not going anywhere,
he's a nice guy.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.480
Yeah. I figured
I'd throw him a bone

31:54.513 --> 31:56.382
if he ever wanted
to go look for it.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.616
Couldn't have been
more specific?

31:57.649 --> 31:58.484
Tell him exactly
where the key is,

31:58.517 --> 32:00.352
maybe spare my floors?

32:00.386 --> 32:01.453
No, what fun would that be?

32:01.487 --> 32:03.055
Look,
it's your key now.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.491
So, where do the diamonds
go from here, huh?

32:05.524 --> 32:07.393
Auctioned off
to the highest bidder?

32:10.496 --> 32:13.165
Oh.
(laughing): Oh, my!

32:13.199 --> 32:15.401
You don't know
where they are, do you?

32:15.434 --> 32:17.503
Well, yeah, 'cause otherwise,
why would you be here?

32:17.536 --> 32:19.538
We'll find them.

32:19.571 --> 32:22.241
Or I could expedite
that process.

32:22.274 --> 32:26.412
In exchange for, hmm,
some considerations.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.080
No. No, we do not make deals.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.548
Listen. I know
I'm not leaving.

32:29.581 --> 32:32.618
But would a bigger cell
be too much to ask for?

32:32.651 --> 32:35.021
A corner one
with a view.

32:35.054 --> 32:38.490
Think about it, you get
to crack the big diamond heist.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.626
Solve the mystery.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.295
I'll happily confess, hmm?

32:43.329 --> 32:45.597
I mean, what's another
life term? Right?

32:45.631 --> 32:47.466
You could be heroes.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.001
For nothing more than
a room with a view.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.102
Boss, he's got a good point.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.437
Keep walking, McGee.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.180
PAMELA:
Congresswoman Flemming
to see you, Director.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.482
Send her in.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.051
Before the storm
arrives, Gibbs,

33:05.084 --> 33:06.252
I just want to say
I didn't know

33:06.285 --> 33:08.320
how exhausting
politics could be.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.222
You're not even running yet.
Yet?

33:10.256 --> 33:12.091
Don't you start on me.
Why not?

33:12.124 --> 33:14.026
I'd vote for you.
Why, Gibbs, that might be

33:14.060 --> 33:15.594
the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

33:15.627 --> 33:18.030
Oh, good.
Gibbs, you're here.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.431
Yes, I work here.

33:19.465 --> 33:22.101
And you're crazy... both of you.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.769
Jenna.
All due respect,

33:23.802 --> 33:26.272
I understand your policy
against cutting deals,

33:26.305 --> 33:28.074
but honestly,

33:28.107 --> 33:31.443
who cares what the inside of
Triff's cell looks like?

33:31.477 --> 33:33.645
He killed four people.
For which he's in prison.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.514
From which he can now
help you solve

33:35.547 --> 33:37.816
the Pretoria diamond heist.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.818
And we may have to resort
to that, but first

33:39.851 --> 33:42.154
I would rather give my agents
a fair shot.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.255
GIBBS: We're still combing
through evidence.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.357
(phone rings)
Abby's got it right now,
in fact...

33:45.391 --> 33:46.358
That's her.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.793
Yeah, Abbs.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.528
Got something for you, Gibbs.
On my way.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.163
I don't mean to overstep.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.664
Again.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.301
I'm just excited for all of you.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.604
Tell him. We're all
on the same team.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.172
(door closes)

34:00.206 --> 34:02.141
Jenna, what the hell was that?

34:02.174 --> 34:04.110
You have to remember,
we're not politicians here.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.677
We don't dance with the devil.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.313
We put devils away

34:07.346 --> 34:08.647
or we put 'em down.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.149
(scoffs)

34:10.182 --> 34:12.318
You think I dance
with the devil?

34:12.351 --> 34:14.686
What? You think you don't?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.222
You can let the Kai Chens
of the world operate

34:16.255 --> 34:18.824
as long as it serves your
greater good; we cannot.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.327
Our greater good helps
a lot of people.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.828
Of course it does and so do you,

34:22.861 --> 34:24.730
but just not the way we do.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.300
It's nothing personal.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.836
It's nothing personal?

34:30.869 --> 34:32.304
It's not.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.406
Uh-huh.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.142
I'm between meetings.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.876
Armed Services Committee.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.145
Jenna...
I got to go.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.412
Uh, believe me,

34:40.446 --> 34:42.248
I would put Triff
in a four-star hotel

34:42.281 --> 34:43.882
if I thought it would make
all our problems go away.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.817
But then he'd just ask
for a five-star.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.520
I get it.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.623
(door closes)

34:52.691 --> 34:54.193
Talk to me.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.128
Well, nothing on
the key yet, Gibbs,

34:56.162 --> 34:58.330
but Abby may have
something better.

34:58.364 --> 34:59.898
It's from Louis Cole's T-shirt,

34:59.931 --> 35:02.901
or rather, something that
was inside his T-shirt.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.804
A hair follicle that
is clearly not his own.

35:05.837 --> 35:06.805
Whose own is it?

35:06.838 --> 35:08.207
Well, DNA takes time.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.141
Is that purple?

35:09.175 --> 35:10.376
It's purple
hair dye, yeah.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.746
Purple hair.

35:14.780 --> 35:18.450
I was afraid to say anything.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.519
I didn't want to get in trouble.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.421
You're not in
trouble, Margo.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.822
Louis was sweet.

35:23.855 --> 35:27.626
He just wanted a fresh
start, same as me.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.829
Away from prisons
and halfway houses.

35:30.862 --> 35:34.833
Reunite with his daughter.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.870
Maybe open a little restaurant
out west somewhere.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.242
Start a family of our own.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.676
BISHOP:
But...

35:44.710 --> 35:46.712
That would take money.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.215
That's all we wanted.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.950
I didn't know
Louis even had a gun.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.620
Is the guy who lived there okay?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.722
Yeah. He's fine.

35:56.755 --> 36:00.792
That key was gonna make
everything better for us.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.929
If there even was a key.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.397
There was.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.400
We have it.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.436
You do?

36:11.770 --> 36:14.306
Uh... mm, were the diamonds

36:14.340 --> 36:15.807
where Louis' friend said
they'd be?

36:15.841 --> 36:18.310
And where was that?

36:18.344 --> 36:20.512
You mean you don't know?

36:22.281 --> 36:23.782
Margo, look at me.

36:25.451 --> 36:26.618
There's no deal
to be had here.

36:26.652 --> 36:27.919
You won't need one.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.422
You want to make it better?

36:30.456 --> 36:32.190
Just tell us.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.995
Delaware.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.397
He said

36:38.430 --> 36:40.699
some tiny bank in Delaware.

36:40.732 --> 36:44.202
Um, Selbyville, maybe?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.719
(sighing):
Thanks.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.758
Wait, let me record this.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.994
Well, just remember,
Al Capone's vault

37:09.027 --> 37:11.330
had a whole lot
of nothing inside.

37:12.731 --> 37:13.899
Okay.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.512
(laughs)

37:26.545 --> 37:28.780
That is not nothing.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.283
(laughs)

37:34.486 --> 37:40.292
Hmm. So, no window, hmm?

37:40.326 --> 37:41.627
I'm afraid not.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.430
Well, can I at least keep this?

37:44.463 --> 37:46.332
Sure.

37:46.365 --> 37:49.301
And was there something else or
did you just come here to gloat?

37:51.503 --> 37:55.607
I want to know
if there are any, uh,

37:55.641 --> 37:58.444
additional surprises
I should be expecting.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.779
Any more occupants
in the apartment?

38:00.812 --> 38:02.047
Well, if you expect them,

38:02.080 --> 38:04.049
they won't be surprises,
now, will they?

38:04.082 --> 38:05.951
But...

38:05.984 --> 38:10.389
if you must know...
what's it worth to you?

38:10.422 --> 38:13.325
I should've known better.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.361
Enjoy your third life sentence.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.595
Hey.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.398
You're good.
MAN: Open door three.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.567
(lock buzzes)
No more surprises.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.373
Maybe.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.777
(chuckling)

38:32.844 --> 38:35.080
(lock buzzes)

38:37.416 --> 38:40.085
NEWSMAN: And a major break
in two high-profile cases today

38:40.118 --> 38:42.988
as a spokesman for the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service,

38:43.021 --> 38:44.590
known as NCIS,
reports the recovery of...

38:44.623 --> 38:46.792
(scoffs) So, has
Hollywood called yet

38:46.825 --> 38:48.093
for the movie rights?

38:48.126 --> 38:49.828
(chuckles)
No, not yet.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.131
I'm not selling mine unless
Denzel Washington plays me.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.468
How's that for
raising my profile?

38:56.502 --> 38:58.637
Forget your profile.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.639
I'm done pushing you.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.119
Hey, Jenna.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.422
What you do so well,

39:16.455 --> 39:19.425
I'm just not sure that I
would be very good at it.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.426
Yeah.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.761
Too honest.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.129
No, no, I never,
I never said that.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.864
You said I danced
with the devil.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.132
That had nothing
to do with honesty.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.167
And that it's
nothing personal?
It wasn't.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.103
But it is to me.
It is.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.405
It is personal.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.473
It's who I am.

39:34.506 --> 39:37.042
It's what I do and I love it.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.511
I make no apologies.
Nor should you.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.588
I think the world of you, Lee...

39:50.822 --> 39:53.525
...but...

39:53.559 --> 39:54.826
But what?

39:54.860 --> 39:58.630
I don't know.
(sighs)

40:01.867 --> 40:04.503
Well, for a couple
of professional problem solvers,

40:04.536 --> 40:06.838
we're not... very good at this.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.641
(both laugh)

40:11.877 --> 40:14.880
It's time...

40:14.913 --> 40:17.883
for me to take a step back.

40:23.489 --> 40:24.756
Okay.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.969
(whispering):
I'm sorry.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.978
Yeah, me, too.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.988
I don't know, I still think,
uh, McGee shouldn't tell her.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.256
Well, this is gonna
make that a lot harder.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.692
BISHOP: I have to say, Nick, for
someone who's lied for a living,

41:00.726 --> 41:02.661
you sure have a lot of
opinions about lying.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.963
Lying undercover is nothing
like real life. Okay?

41:04.996 --> 41:07.833
For one thing,
actual lives are at stake.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.735
Well, sometimes
in real life, too.

41:09.768 --> 41:10.969
TORRES:
Oh, like, uh...

41:11.002 --> 41:12.704
like with your family, Alex?

41:13.739 --> 41:16.041
Like all that
necessary evil stuff? Hmm?

41:16.074 --> 41:17.643
What are you not telling us?

41:17.676 --> 41:20.111
Just keep it moving, sister,
nothing to see here.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.513
What is it Mark Twain said?

41:21.547 --> 41:22.948
"If you always tell the truth,

41:22.981 --> 41:24.616
you never have
to remember anything"?

41:24.650 --> 41:26.718
Mark Twain never found a body
under his bed.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.520
Hey, how'd it go
with Triff?

41:28.554 --> 41:30.989
Uh... it, uh, it went well.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.559
I got what I needed, sort of.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.060
Well, we were just saying
how you made the right call

41:35.093 --> 41:36.728
by not telling Delilah.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.029
No, we weren't.

41:38.063 --> 41:39.598
I told her.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.266
What? When?

41:41.299 --> 41:43.635
Just now,
on the way back.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.502
Kind of had to with
the news and everything.

41:44.536 --> 41:45.971
Whoa, you told,
you told her everything?

41:46.004 --> 41:47.305
The body and
the triple homicides?

41:47.338 --> 41:48.306
Everything...

41:48.339 --> 41:50.776
except the part about me knowing

41:50.809 --> 41:51.643
about the triple homicide
beforehand.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.679
I'm not crazy.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.313
I'm counting on each one of you
to keep that secret for me.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.615
It dies with me, homie.

41:56.648 --> 41:57.683
Me, too.

41:57.716 --> 41:58.750
Whatever.

42:00.752 --> 42:03.789
Hey, so, uh...
how'd she take it?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.290
Surprisingly well.

42:05.323 --> 42:06.925
Well, there's gonna
be, I think, a lot

42:06.958 --> 42:08.960
of disinfecting and sage-ing
in the next couple months.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.161
(Quinn chuckles)

42:10.195 --> 42:11.229
(door unlocks and opens)

42:11.262 --> 42:13.264
(dog barking in distance)

42:17.135 --> 42:19.838
Hello?

42:19.871 --> 42:21.006
Who's there?

42:21.039 --> 42:23.609
Someone there?

42:23.642 --> 42:26.945
McGee.

42:26.978 --> 42:29.180
Hey, boss.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.951
You gonna help me
fix your floors or what?
