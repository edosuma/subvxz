00:02.044 --> 00:04.130
<i>In tenth grade,
high school students</i>

00:04.213 --> 00:07.299
<i>are presented with picking
a class of their own choosing.</i>

00:07.383 --> 00:10.553
<i>This is called an elective.</i>

00:10.636 --> 00:13.305
<i>Courses on offer
included wood shop...</i>

00:13.389 --> 00:15.391
<i>I'm happy with ten fingers,
thank you.</i>

00:15.474 --> 00:18.102
<i>Introduction to agriculture...</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:19.812
<i>I think you know
the answer to that.</i>

00:19.895 --> 00:21.480
<i>Wrestling...</i>

00:22.773 --> 00:24.275
<i>I'd rather milk that cow.</i>

00:24.817 --> 00:27.987
<i>All of which led me to the
elective I reluctantly chose...</i>

00:28.070 --> 00:30.990
<i>Psychology 101,
an investigation</i>

00:31.073 --> 00:34.785
<i>into why people think and feel
the way they do. Ugh.</i>

00:34.869 --> 00:36.120
All right,

00:36.203 --> 00:37.681
with Thanksgiving
weekend approaching,

00:37.705 --> 00:39.290
it's the perfect
opportunity to observe

00:39.373 --> 00:42.918
family dynamics
and how our parents, relatives

00:43.002 --> 00:44.170
and siblings affect us.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.088
Now, the...

00:46.172 --> 00:47.173
Yes, Sheldon.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.924
I don't find that interesting.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.760
Well, tough knuckles.
That's the assignment.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.096
Now, you'll all be expected
to collect data on your family,

00:54.180 --> 00:56.432
form a hypothesis,
and make a prediction.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.226
So you're giving us
homework for Thanksgiving?

00:59.977 --> 01:01.228
Yes.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.272
Oh, boy.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.318
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

01:07.401 --> 01:10.154
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

01:10.237 --> 01:12.740
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

01:12.823 --> 01:15.076
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:15.159 --> 01:19.705
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:26.837
Hey, listen, something
came up today

01:26.921 --> 01:29.215
- that we need to talk about.
- What's that?

01:30.174 --> 01:32.176
I maybe have a shot
at a better job.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.846
Oh, George, they're finally
gonna make you head coach?

01:35.930 --> 01:37.056
Better than that.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.683
Special Teams Coach,
University of Tulsa.

01:40.226 --> 01:41.644
In Oklahoma?

01:41.727 --> 01:44.146
That is where they're keeping
Tulsa these days.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.606
No need to be lippy.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.192
<i>You're not seriously
thinking about moving</i>

01:48.275 --> 01:50.653
<i>this whole family
to Oklahoma, are you?</i>

01:50.736 --> 01:53.197
<i>It's 400 miles away.
I wasn't gonna commute.</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:54.949
<i>Well, that's not gonna work.</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:57.785
<i>The kids are all settled in
with school and friends,</i>

01:57.868 --> 01:59.537
and I've got my job
at the church,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.038
and then there's Mom.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.915
Am I supposed to just
walk away from her?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.542
<i>No, what
you're supposed to do</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:06.585
<i>is support my efforts
to improve our life.</i>

02:14.593 --> 02:16.345
Notes for psychology paper.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.429
Whatcha doing?

02:17.513 --> 02:20.266
Shh. Family conflict
has been observed.

02:20.349 --> 02:24.186
Subject M and Subject D have
opposing views on relocating.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.731
You better not be recording
over my Janet Jackson tape.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.441
Would you please?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.360
Who's Subject M and Subject D?

02:31.443 --> 02:34.071
I can't tell you that.
You might skew the results.

02:34.155 --> 02:36.949
Okay, then tell me
what skew means.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.826
Are you going to talk
the whole time?

02:38.909 --> 02:42.163
It seems to be annoying you,
so, yeah.

02:46.625 --> 02:50.087
Mary, I just can't thank you
enough for inviting me today.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.257
You're very welcome, John.
Love having you here.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.969
Last Thanksgiving, I just sat
in my apartment all by myself

02:57.052 --> 02:59.013
and ate a turkey sandwich.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.431
That is so sad.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.433
Well, it wasn't
at the time,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.602
but now that I have something
to compare it to,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.271
I realize what
a pathetic loser I was.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.565
You were never a loser.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.984
Yeah, you were.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.195
Hey, Georgie,

03:14.278 --> 03:16.488
you have any sentimental
attachment to this town?

03:16.572 --> 03:18.866
- I don't know, why?
- I'm just curious if,

03:18.949 --> 03:21.327
you know, we ever did
pick up and live somewhere else,

03:21.410 --> 03:22.411
how you'd feel about it.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.539
Well, if it was Hawaii,
I'd feel pretty great.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.917
That's where they make
<i>Magnum, P.I.</i>

03:28.000 --> 03:29.627
I don't think Hawaii's
in the cards.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.878
How about Miami?

03:30.961 --> 03:33.005
Let me guess,
'cause of <i>Miami Vice?</i>

03:33.088 --> 03:34.590
<i>Golden Girls.</i>

03:34.673 --> 03:36.217
Course.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.468
Car.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.304
I saw this one

03:40.387 --> 03:42.097
where Blanche dates
this little guy

03:42.181 --> 03:46.101
who breaks up with her 'cause
she's not Jewish. So good.

03:46.185 --> 03:49.563
Forget about Miami
and Hawaii and Blanche.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.399
I mean, how do you feel about
not staying in Medford forever?

03:52.483 --> 03:54.318
Well, I guess
I'd be okay with it.

03:55.611 --> 03:56.654
All right.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.738
Good to know.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.699
Subject D is attempting
to influence Subject G

04:00.783 --> 04:02.034
regarding relocating.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.285
What about you, Sheldon?

04:04.370 --> 04:05.871
What about me what?

04:05.955 --> 04:07.915
Could you ever see yourself
leaving Medford?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.835
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I'm unable to express

04:11.919 --> 04:13.545
an opinion at this time.

04:13.629 --> 04:14.672
Why not?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.339
In the interest of science,

04:16.423 --> 04:18.425
I have to remain
a neutral observer.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.262
Glad I asked.

04:21.345 --> 04:24.556
Hey, fellows, may I join?

04:24.640 --> 04:27.268
Sure. Here you go.

04:29.228 --> 04:30.521
Dang, nice catch.

04:33.857 --> 04:34.984
Car.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.196
Listen, I'm gonna need
your help with something.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.031
- Is it about money?
- No.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.284
Then I'm your gal.
What's up?

04:43.367 --> 04:46.370
George is up for a coaching job
at the University of Tulsa.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.622
Tulsa? Ugh.

04:48.706 --> 04:51.834
Last year, I lost $800
on that damn team.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.794
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.754
I'm fine with most
of the Division I stuff,

04:55.838 --> 04:58.215
but these independent teams,

04:58.299 --> 05:00.843
I j... I just can't seem
to get a handle on it.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.887
You think if George got that job
he might give me an inside line?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.389
Mom.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.932
Well, I'd cut him in,

05:07.016 --> 05:08.600
make it look like
a Christmas present.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.102
Would you please listen to me?

05:10.185 --> 05:11.395
If we move up there,

05:11.478 --> 05:13.147
other than holidays,

05:13.230 --> 05:14.857
you're not gonna
see your grandkids.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.693
Well, that's a point.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.904
You make it sound like
a <i>Sophie's Choice</i> kind of deal.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.325
During dinner,
maybe you could express

05:24.408 --> 05:27.953
how devastating it would be
to be away from the kids.

05:28.037 --> 05:30.539
Well, I don't think I'd use
the word "devastating."

05:30.622 --> 05:32.041
That doesn't sound like me.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.793
Okay, well,
use whatever word you want.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.839
I might use... "heartbroken."

05:39.631 --> 05:40.799
Good, use that.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.552
Yeah, maybe.
Have you got a thesaurus?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.892
Oh, dear.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.227
Don't be scared, Sheldon,
it's just a parade.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.812
I already
don't like dogs.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.148
Gigantic and floating
does not help.

05:56.774 --> 05:59.109
- Hey, how's the parade?
- Great.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.861
Alf is one of the hosts.

06:00.944 --> 06:04.948
Alf, cool. Hey, so listen.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.409
How attached are you
to living here in Medford?

06:07.493 --> 06:09.036
I don't know
what that means.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.621
If we moved away,

06:10.704 --> 06:13.290
do you have really good friends
that you'd miss a lot?

06:13.374 --> 06:14.666
I have really good friends,

06:14.750 --> 06:16.502
but I think they
would mostly miss me.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.379
'Cause you make friends
wherever you go.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.464
I do. People
are drawn to me.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.548
Ugh.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.052
Sorry, I'm neutral.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.596
Okay, so what I'm hearing
is that

06:27.679 --> 06:29.681
you'd be happy no matter
where we lived.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.101
I guess. Dad, please,
I'm trying to watch TV.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.396
Sorry. I'll leave you to it.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.569
Oh dear, Big Bird.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.831
You're making a sandwich?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.666
I'm a creature of habit.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.002
Hey, why don't we all
go around the table

06:59.086 --> 07:01.046
and say what we're thankful for?

07:01.130 --> 07:02.548
Come on, really?

07:02.631 --> 07:03.882
Yes, really.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.217
I'll start.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.012
I'm thankful to be surrounded
by my loving family.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.722
What about that guy?

07:10.806 --> 07:12.558
That guy, Dr. Sturgis,

07:12.641 --> 07:14.476
is part of our
extended family.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.186
Mm, thank you.

07:16.270 --> 07:20.149
And I'm also thankful
for this warm and comfy home

07:20.232 --> 07:22.901
that God has blessed us with,
and this great neighborhood

07:22.985 --> 07:24.820
with my mom living

07:24.903 --> 07:26.113
right across the street,

07:26.196 --> 07:29.116
and of course
our excellent

07:29.199 --> 07:31.535
school system
that provides our children

07:31.618 --> 07:33.745
with a world-class education.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.622
Missy?

07:35.706 --> 07:38.459
I'm thankful that there's two
different <i>Ghostbuster</i> cartoons.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.710
That's it?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.545
Unless you know
about a third one.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.922
Okay, my turn.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.426
Um, I am so thankful
to be able to watch

07:47.509 --> 07:48.760
my grandchildren grow up.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.762
And I can't
even tell you

07:50.846 --> 07:52.347
how much it
means to me

07:52.431 --> 07:54.808
that y'all live
right across the street.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.643
And if y'all weren't,

07:56.727 --> 07:59.938
I would just be... heartbroken.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.526
And not just heartbroken...

08:04.610 --> 08:07.738
crestfallen and chagrined.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.531
And, uh,

08:09.615 --> 08:11.074
I'm also thankful
for my health,

08:11.158 --> 08:13.619
that that mole on my hip
turned out to be nothing,

08:13.702 --> 08:15.204
and, uh,

08:15.287 --> 08:17.122
I'm very thankful for John here,

08:17.206 --> 08:18.665
who has

08:19.249 --> 08:21.460
brought so much happiness to me.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.756
That's it for me.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.592
- Oh, my.
- Lovely, Mom.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.135
Oh, my, I don't know
where to begin.

08:30.219 --> 08:34.472
Well, first of all,
I'm thankful to you, Connie,

08:34.556 --> 08:39.019
for how you make me laugh,
make me feel cared for,

08:39.102 --> 08:41.897
all the ways you're
affectionate to me

08:41.980 --> 08:45.484
that I can't discuss
in... in front of children

08:45.567 --> 08:47.903
because that would be
inappropriate, right?

08:47.986 --> 08:48.987
Right.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.366
And I'm thankful
to be here

08:52.449 --> 08:55.035
with your wonderful family.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.956
This is something I didn't
experience growing up.

08:59.039 --> 09:03.252
See, my father was away
a great deal on business

09:03.335 --> 09:06.171
and it was just me and my mother,

09:06.255 --> 09:09.633
and she was a cold
and distant woman

09:09.716 --> 09:13.512
who blamed the world
for her club foot.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.888
- Sweetie.
- And I...

09:14.972 --> 09:16.265
Wrap it up.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.225
Sorry.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.477
My gratitude
knows no bounds.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.688
- Thank you.
- Georgie?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.774
Um, I'm thankful for my job

09:25.857 --> 09:27.609
at the auto shop.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.320
Uh, let's see...

09:30.404 --> 09:32.948
Oh, Alyssa Milano
from <i>Who's the Boss?</i>

09:33.031 --> 09:37.119
She's really hot.
Mm... That's about it.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.746
That's wonderful. Shelly?

09:39.830 --> 09:41.957
I'm sorry, Mom, but if
I answer that question,

09:42.040 --> 09:44.209
I'd be violating
my experimental protocol.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.170
Okay, moving on. George?

09:47.254 --> 09:48.630
Well...

09:48.714 --> 09:50.314
I'm thankful to share
Thanksgiving dinner

09:50.340 --> 09:52.301
with my family, of course.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.511
I'm also thankful
for this fine country we live in

09:54.595 --> 09:56.847
and all the opportunities
it provides us.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.557
Especially when
those opportunities

09:58.640 --> 10:01.893
come once in a lifetime
and require taking a small risk

10:01.977 --> 10:03.854
and believing in one another.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.440
We're really gonna do this now?

10:06.523 --> 10:09.693
Hey, you started it with
all that school system crap.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.945
I only did that
because you've been

10:12.029 --> 10:13.822
trying to twist
the kids' heads around.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.699
All right, who talked?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.784
- Who do you think?
- Missy.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.328
Yup.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.889
Well, it doesn't matter
because you obviously

10:21.913 --> 10:24.499
went to your mother
and made her your stalking horse.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.876
Of course she went to me.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.587
Move to Oklahoma,
what's wrong with you?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.297
Wait, we're moving
to Oklahoma?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.132
I thought Texans
don't like Oklahoma.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.550
You're damn right we don't.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.886
- What's wrong with Oklahoma?
- I'll tell you later.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.347
Okay, that's enough of this.
Nobody's moving anywhere.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.891
Let's just have
a nice, quiet dinner.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.519
That's it? Y-You're gonna
make the decision for me?

10:44.603 --> 10:45.937
I'm making a decision for us.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.148
All right, then.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.441
Where are you going?

10:49.524 --> 10:50.776
George.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.778
George!

11:00.619 --> 11:02.496
<i>As we sat in silence,</i>

11:02.579 --> 11:04.581
<i>I had a horrible realization.</i>

11:04.665 --> 11:06.541
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

11:06.625 --> 11:10.170
<i>I didn't look forward
to doing my homework.</i>

11:20.305 --> 11:22.015
Just watch the TV.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.105
<i>Second down, nine...</i>

11:36.988 --> 11:38.990
Difficult day.

11:39.658 --> 11:40.909
Yes.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.830
Psychology? Is that a
new interest of yours?

11:44.913 --> 11:47.833
- It was either this or milking cows.
- Oh.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.919
I once was
licked by a cow.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.504
You made the
right choice.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.089
I'm not so sure.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.549
Why is that?

11:55.632 --> 11:58.844
Well, I was supposed
to observe family dynamics

11:58.927 --> 12:01.138
over Thanksgiving
for my hypothesis,

12:01.221 --> 12:02.431
then make a prediction.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.475
Oh. All right.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.978
So, um, what
did you observe?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.897
My mom and dad arguing
over moving to Oklahoma

12:10.981 --> 12:12.190
for my dad's job.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.943
I would concur
with that observation.

12:15.026 --> 12:18.739
Now, can you form a
hypothesis based on that?

12:19.322 --> 12:22.576
Well, their marriage
is a zero sum game.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.952
What's good for my father

12:24.035 --> 12:26.079
isn't good for my mother
and vice versa.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.289
Excellent.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.623
And your prediction?

12:28.707 --> 12:31.001
Well, based on
previous arguments

12:31.084 --> 12:33.044
I've observed,
my father will try

12:33.128 --> 12:34.546
to reassert his dominance

12:34.629 --> 12:36.882
by making a meaningless
symbolic gesture.

12:36.965 --> 12:40.177
Really? That seems
a bit of a stretch.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.892
<i>♪ You take it on the run, baby ♪</i>

12:46.975 --> 12:50.187

13:01.865 --> 13:03.325

13:03.408 --> 13:05.118

13:05.202 --> 13:06.578
<i>It's a Fiero.</i>

13:06.661 --> 13:08.497
<i>Ferrari, Fiero, same thing.</i>

13:08.580 --> 13:09.790
<i>Not really.</i>

13:09.873 --> 13:11.601
<i>Now, do you mind?
I'm trying to watch the game.</i>

13:11.625 --> 13:13.019
Everybody's going to Meemaw's.
Come on.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.252
<i>Leave that tin can...</i>

13:14.336 --> 13:15.670
It's not like we haven't

13:15.754 --> 13:17.440
- heard them fight before.
- Just keep moving.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.467
Are we sleeping there?
Do I need to bring pajamas?

13:20.550 --> 13:22.135
Just sleep in
your underwear.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.470
In my underwear?

13:23.553 --> 13:25.013
I hardly think so.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.765
Wait, I forgot something.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.159
<i>Just so you know,
you're sleeping out here tonight.</i>

13:28.183 --> 13:30.435
Perfect, then I won't
have to move.

13:30.519 --> 13:34.272
I just want to thank you
for a lovely dinner.

Good.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.271
Come on!

14:20.902 --> 14:23.113
You kids excited
to go back to school?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.531
Of course I am.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.949
He doesn't speak for me.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.410
What are you doing?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.619
Having coffee.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.538
Uh, no, not in my house.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.248
Oh, come on,
the best part of waking up

14:33.331 --> 14:34.499
is Folgers in your cup.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.876
Put it down.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.461
I can't drink coffee,

14:38.545 --> 14:40.881
I can't chew tobacco.
Is there anything I can do?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.549
Yeah, quit talking.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.050
Where's Dad?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.845
He went to Oklahoma
for that job interview.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.688
I thought you put your
foot down on that one.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.473
Just keep eating your breakfast.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.601
You really think
we might move there?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.188
I don't know what to think.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.277
Spending the
Thanksgiving weekend

15:02.360 --> 15:04.029
working in my family's
convenience store,

15:04.112 --> 15:06.406
I observed my father
and mother working

15:06.489 --> 15:09.159
from 6:00 in the morning
till 10:00 at night.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.578
My hypothesis was that
economic advancement

15:11.661 --> 15:14.748
for immigrant families
is more important than celebrating

15:14.831 --> 15:16.917
a holiday where people eat
until they pass out

15:17.000 --> 15:18.793
in front of the TV.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.337
All right, Tam.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.714
Well, based on your
observations and hypothesis,

15:22.797 --> 15:24.507
were you able to
make a prediction?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.719
Yes. At some point,
my father will die

15:27.802 --> 15:29.638
prematurely from stress,

15:29.721 --> 15:31.264
and my mother
will come live with me,

15:31.348 --> 15:32.891
where she will
constantly disapprove

15:32.974 --> 15:36.311
of my hot, blonde,
American wife.

15:38.563 --> 15:43.109
Okay. Uh, I think we all
learned something there.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.527
Uh, thank you, Tam.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.321
Uh, Mr. Cooper,
you're up.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.080
Beginning on Wednesday night,
I observed my parents

15:55.163 --> 15:58.708
arguing over the possibility
of us moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.543
Ugh, Oklahoma.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.505
The argument escalated
and then my father stormed out

16:03.588 --> 16:05.423
and bought a Fiero.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.760
And then I went to my Meemaw's

16:08.843 --> 16:10.387
and slept in my underwear!

16:14.099 --> 16:17.519
That's it. I've wasted my life.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.233
You want to tell
me what happened?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.318
Instead of remaining
a neutral observer,

16:25.402 --> 16:28.279
I got emotional
in front of the whole class.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.572
Well, that's
not a big deal.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.825
Yes, it is. I'm a scientist.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.285
You never hear about Newton
crying like a baby

16:34.369 --> 16:36.371
when he got brutalized
by an apple.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.456
I think you're being
a little tough on yourself.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.335
I wonder why this
is affecting me so much.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.880
Well, maybe it has something
to do with your parents arguing.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.591
Us moving? I don't think so.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.094
Texas, Oklahoma...
what's the difference?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.638
Hey, now, I think you
might want to crack open

16:53.722 --> 16:57.392
your psychology textbook
'cause that there is crazy talk.

16:57.976 --> 17:01.104
I did read a chapter
on repressing emotions.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.857
I suppose I could've been
doing that to avoid dealing

17:03.940 --> 17:05.608
with the fear of change,

17:05.692 --> 17:08.361
and moving would certainly
be a big change.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.989
- That's very astute.
- I'd have a new room,

17:11.071 --> 17:12.906
in a new house,

17:12.991 --> 17:15.577
and the new house would probably
have a different smell,

17:15.660 --> 17:17.244
and I probably
wouldn't like that smell

17:17.328 --> 17:19.122
because I don't like new smells,

17:19.204 --> 17:22.250
and I'd be going to a new school
with new kids and new teachers,

17:22.333 --> 17:24.103
and I bet they'd all
smell different, as well.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.336
Okay, now calm down.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.628
That's easy for you to say.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.340
Your olfactory senses
aren't about to be assaulted

17:29.424 --> 17:30.884
by the state of Oklahoma.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.428
Okay, let's try
a different approach.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.472
Can I take you
to get some ice cream?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.308
I'm having an emotional
crisis, Meemaw.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.393
You can't fix that
with ice cream.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.979
Right. Sorry.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.442
You want to go
to Radio Shack?

17:47.525 --> 17:50.070
Yes, I want to go
to Radio Shack!

17:54.282 --> 17:57.619
Well, sir, that's the tour.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.622
What do you think,
nicer than East Texas?

18:00.705 --> 18:02.540
Very impressive.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.000
Not sure how
you did it,

18:04.084 --> 18:06.562
but that is the least disgusting
locker room I've ever been in.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.837
Yes, sir.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.672
Every bit of it's brand,
spanking new.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.217
I bet if you had to, you could
even eat lunch in there.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.428
So what do you say, George?

18:15.512 --> 18:17.305
I could sure use a man
with your track record

18:17.388 --> 18:20.058
to coach special teams. Please.

18:20.141 --> 18:24.229
Thank you. I got to say,
I'm real tempted.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.147
How does the family feel
about relocating?

18:26.898 --> 18:30.151
Oh, they're all pretty excited
about the opportunity.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.946
The kids see it as an adventure.

18:33.905 --> 18:37.242
So why am I feeling like
you got some hesitation?

18:37.325 --> 18:38.660
If it's about the money,

18:38.743 --> 18:39.804
I believe I can get you
some more money.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.497
No, no, no, the money's good.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.416
Well, that's it, then.
You're gonna fit in perfectly

18:45.500 --> 18:46.584
with our program here.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.748
We got a lovely little house
for you and your family,

18:48.795 --> 18:50.130
and best of all,

18:50.213 --> 18:52.382
you're gonna be out of Texas.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.843
I thought you started out
in Houston?

18:54.926 --> 18:58.346
Shh. I'm trying
to fit in around here.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.518
So, we have a deal?

19:29.127 --> 19:30.545
What happened?

19:33.506 --> 19:34.674
Can I take my coat off?

19:34.757 --> 19:36.676
No. What happened?

19:38.136 --> 19:39.721
I turned it down.

19:39.804 --> 19:40.805
Why?

19:40.889 --> 19:42.932
'Cause you're
afraid of Mom?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.560
'Cause I don't want to live
in Oklahoma.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.061
George.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.521
What difference
does it make, Mare?

19:48.605 --> 19:49.647
We're not moving.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.652
<i>As a child,
I never understood</i>

19:54.736 --> 19:57.989
<i>the sacrifices my father made
for his family's happiness,</i>

19:58.072 --> 19:59.949
<i>which made me somewhat
less compassionate</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:01.201
<i>than I should've been.</i>

20:01.284 --> 20:02.952
Yay! We're not moving!

20:03.036 --> 20:04.746
We're staying in Texas!

20:14.464 --> 20:16.633
<i>- John?
- Yes?</i>

20:18.593 --> 20:21.346
Could we do it
just one more time?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.515
Really? I don't want you
to get tired of it.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.976
I won't.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.312
Please?

20:29.395 --> 20:31.814
Well, I can't say no to you.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.070
Fire in the hole.

20:38.112 --> 20:41.241
Unbelievable.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.411
Again, again.
