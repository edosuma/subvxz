of "mythbusters"...

00:16.200 --> 00:18.566
This is just wrong.

00:18.567 --> 00:20.633
This is terrifying.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.132
Come on, Jamie!

00:24.133 --> 00:28.066
The team feels the fear
and doubles the danger

00:28.067 --> 00:30.799
for two crazy commercial myths.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.999
I'm going to need
some psychotherapy after this.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.666
First, Adam and Jamie are at
the end of their tethers...

00:36.667 --> 00:38.332
Are you kidding?
This is a hobby?

00:43.567 --> 00:45.132
He did it!

00:45.133 --> 00:48.032
In the midst
of a 100-foot bungee jump.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.032
What did i get myself into?

00:50.033 --> 00:51.499
[ Grunts ]

00:51.500 --> 00:56.099
Then, kari, Tory, and Grant
get some serious air

00:56.100 --> 00:59.700
taking on an ad
that serves up sky-high sport.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.466
But can you play tennis...

01:02.467 --> 01:05.566
A little scary.
I'm not going to lie.

01:05.567 --> 01:08.266
On the wing
of a plane in flight?

01:08.267 --> 01:09.733

01:44.733 --> 01:47.767

discovery communications

01:53.433 --> 01:54.966
there's a commercial out there

01:54.967 --> 01:58.466
that shows a guy bungee jumping
off of a platform 100 feet

01:58.467 --> 02:01.266
into a little barrel
full of apples.

02:01.267 --> 02:04.332
And when he comes up,
he's got an apple in his teeth.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.332
I see a lot of bungee jumping
in our future.

02:07.333 --> 02:08.666
Yep.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.899
Because when the crazy
commercial in question aired,

02:10.900 --> 02:13.866
it took the harmless,
age-old act of apple bobbing

02:13.867 --> 02:17.599
and added
a frightening 100-foot fall.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.132
But can you really get the drop
on a bungee apple Bob...

02:23.133 --> 02:27.066
And pull it off injury-free?

02:27.067 --> 02:30.066
Well, with Jamie's famous fear
of heights...

02:30.067 --> 02:31.666
It really is quite hairy.

02:31.667 --> 02:34.266
This could be
his worst nightmare.

02:34.267 --> 02:35.632
That is absolutely awful.

02:35.633 --> 02:36.966
[ Laughs ]

02:36.967 --> 02:38.932
To my mind, there's three things
we've got to investigate

02:38.933 --> 02:40.266
in this.

02:40.267 --> 02:43.366
One is, can your depth
of your drop of bungee jumping

02:43.367 --> 02:45.799
be made precise enough
so that when you hit the water

02:45.800 --> 02:48.366
you don't hit the bottom
and kill yourself?

02:48.367 --> 02:52.299
Two... can you actually aim
where you fall in bungee jumping

02:52.300 --> 02:54.066
to hit a target
as small as a barrel?

02:54.067 --> 02:55.566
And three, if all of that works,

02:55.567 --> 02:57.866
can you actually come up
with an apple in your teeth?

02:57.867 --> 02:59.532
And we have to do all this?

02:59.533 --> 03:02.432
I was thinking that we could
start out with buster doing it.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.532
Well, better buster than me.

03:04.533 --> 03:06.466
Yeah, that's what
i was thinking.

03:06.467 --> 03:09.399
So, to test this bungee Bob,

03:09.400 --> 03:12.499
it's off to Cunningham pool
in vallejo, California.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.666
To conduct this experiment,

03:14.667 --> 03:16.899
we're going to need
a few key ingredients.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.799
First and foremost are apples
and a barrel to put them in.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.900
We've chosen a fairly large one.

03:23.067 --> 03:27.632
A crane to do our dropping from
and a bungee basket.

03:27.633 --> 03:30.499
It is from this platform
100 feet in the air

03:30.500 --> 03:33.199
that all of our bungee drops
will happen from.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.066
Narrator:
But before the mythbusters
start jumping,

03:36.067 --> 03:38.799
firstly,
they're bringing in a fall guy.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.066
We need a buster
who can stand on his own,

03:41.067 --> 03:44.132
a rigid buster
who weighs as much as we do

03:44.133 --> 03:47.166
but can actually stand up
so he can drop consistently.

03:47.167 --> 03:50.566
Jamie: And so, meet buster's
latest incarnation,

03:50.567 --> 03:52.966
bungee buster.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.432
He's made
out of pvc plumbing parts

03:55.433 --> 03:58.066
that will be all glued together
and filled with sand and water

03:58.067 --> 03:59.299
to achieve the correct weight.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.232
He'll serve as our analog
for our initial testing.

04:03.233 --> 04:06.066
Narrator:
Now that buster is rigid enough

04:06.067 --> 04:08.566
to hold
the correct fall posture...

04:08.567 --> 04:10.332
Okay.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.466
With the harness in hand,
that's about 196.

04:13.467 --> 04:15.366
That's our target weight
for everything.

04:15.367 --> 04:19.799
He'll need to weigh
exactly what Jamie does.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.866
And there we go.

04:20.867 --> 04:23.932
We're right at 195.

04:23.933 --> 04:26.932
Everything is going
just as planned.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.399
So,
with their fall guy complete,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.566
it's time to test part one
of this myth.

04:31.567 --> 04:32.866
Excellent.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.799
Can our bungee experts
tune buster's fall

04:35.800 --> 04:37.899
so that when he hits the water,

04:37.900 --> 04:40.666
he won't hit the bottom
of the barrel?

04:40.667 --> 04:43.266
If i had to hazard a guess, I'd
say Jamie is in the basket now

04:43.267 --> 04:45.132
probably complaining
about the height.

04:45.133 --> 04:46.499
He doesn't like them.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.432
Oh, man.

04:48.433 --> 04:49.899
I hate heights.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.132
That was beautiful.

05:05.133 --> 05:06.932
A perfect touch.

05:06.933 --> 05:10.532
Narrator: With a maximum depth
of just 18 inches,

05:10.533 --> 05:13.132
that was a perfect drop
for a Bob.

05:13.133 --> 05:16.066
The question is,
is it always that easy?

05:16.067 --> 05:19.133
In three, two, one.

05:21.567 --> 05:23.399
Come on, baby.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.566
Aw, that was perfect!

05:26.567 --> 05:28.832
[ Chuckling ] Yeah!

05:28.833 --> 05:30.099
Fantastic.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.632

absolutely the same.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.066
We've got our mark.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.266
Adam: Buster did
really, really well.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.832
And our bungee experts
really can dial him in

05:38.833 --> 05:42.232
so that he drops at the same
spot every single time.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.799
I... i really think
it's time for us to jump.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.266
And by us, i mean you first.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.066
Ugh.

[ Laughs ]

05:50.900 --> 05:52.066
Don't get me wrong.

05:52.067 --> 05:54.432
When i do it, I'm going to
hate it just as much.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.066
So, now that buster has proven

05:56.067 --> 05:59.332
that the depth
is repeatable and safe,

05:59.333 --> 06:04.166
it's time to try it with
a much more human analog.

06:04.167 --> 06:06.766
You ever have people barf
when they're at the very end

in their stomach

to 100 feet

one [Bleep] thing to do.

hands on your butt.

lean out just a little bit.

And then, we're going
to do the countdown.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.099
for a high-flying stunt.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.066
So, like Adam and Jamie's myth,

07:21.067 --> 07:23.266
our next myth
is also about flying.

07:23.267 --> 07:25.132
But it's flying with a twist.

07:25.133 --> 07:29.432
See, a top-ranked tennis pro
plays a match with his wingman.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.932
Oh, okay. I know what
you're talking about.
I've seen this video.

07:31.933 --> 07:33.699
It's where
they're playing tennis

07:33.700 --> 07:37.132
on the wing of a plane
while it's in flight.

07:37.133 --> 07:39.366
Right. And they're both
strapped to the wings.
The plane takes off.

07:39.367 --> 07:42.166
And then they start volleying
the ball back and forth

07:42.167 --> 07:44.100
despite how fast
the plane is going.

07:48.633 --> 07:50.966
Narrator: This commercial
elevates the game of tennis

07:50.967 --> 07:52.766
to 5,000 feet

as novak djokovic
and his partner

07:57.067 --> 08:01.199
But is this just an advertising
flight of fancy,

08:01.200 --> 08:06.332
or could you really
play a high-altitude grand slam?

08:06.333 --> 08:08.832
Okay. So, what this myth
really boils down to is,

08:08.833 --> 08:10.766
can you actually
have a tennis rally

08:10.767 --> 08:12.532
on the wing of a plane in flight

08:12.533 --> 08:15.232
with winds rushing past you
at 35 miles an hour?

08:15.233 --> 08:17.166
Wait, why only 35 miles an hour?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.399
Well, i did a little research,
and it turns out,

08:19.400 --> 08:22.666
the plane in the clip
is an Antonov an-2,

08:22.667 --> 08:25.732
which is capable of flying
at speeds as low as 35.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.066
Wow.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.832
All we need to do now
is learn how to wing walk.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.132
I mean, you guys have
played tennis before, right?

08:31.133 --> 08:32.766
No.
Unh-unh.

08:32.767 --> 08:33.932
Mm.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.266

just got a little harder.

first thing's first.

to get a couple tennis lessons

08:47.333 --> 08:48.333
from their head coach,
Peter Wright.

08:48.334 --> 08:49.966
Because let's face it.

08:49.967 --> 08:51.799
Just because
you put us in these outfits

08:51.800 --> 08:54.800
does not mean
we know how to play at all.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.433
We are seriously going to need
some help here.

08:58.633 --> 09:01.699
Narrator: Well, kari and Grant
may be tennis first-timers...

09:01.700 --> 09:04.466
Okay, remember, firm wrist,
out in front a little bit.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.199
Firm wrist, out in front.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.132

Good, there we go.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.466
This is it.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.066
Yeah!

09:11.067 --> 09:13.666
And Tory hasn't played
since high school...

09:13.667 --> 09:16.132
Tory's a natural.
Look at this guy.

09:16.133 --> 09:18.632
Good. Out there in front.
Nice and firm in the wrist.

09:18.633 --> 09:20.566
Beautiful.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.899
But with a little expert
guidance from their coach...

09:23.900 --> 09:26.832
Tory:
Hey, we're not sucking as bad as
i thought we were going to.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.866
Kari: Okay.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.799
Narrator:
They soon get into the swing.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.966
This is no problem.

09:31.967 --> 09:34.266
Who's that djokovic guy?

09:34.267 --> 09:36.332
Grant: We're able to volley
consistently.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.799
But, unfortunately,
that's not the whole story,

09:38.800 --> 09:40.632
because this tennis match
happens

09:40.633 --> 09:42.466
on the wing of a plane
in flight.

09:42.467 --> 09:45.332
It's a calm, clear day,
and we're volleying fine,

09:45.333 --> 09:48.299
but that is more like
volleying in a storm.

We have our fans over

goes up to 35 miles an hour

10:21.533 --> 10:23.932
where it gets interesting,

10:23.933 --> 10:26.066
and the ball no longer travels
in a straight line.

10:26.067 --> 10:29.132
Sometimes it does a corkscrew.
Sometimes it just drops.

But after
a little bit of adjustment

is cleared for takeoff.

we affix it
to the back of a truck

And his final design
has a 40-foot wing

17:12.967 --> 17:14.799
and a 15-foot tower,

17:14.800 --> 17:18.766
along with a network of supports
that will keep this fixed wing

17:18.767 --> 17:22.299

17:26.467 --> 17:29.099

of Grant's mammoth design

17:29.100 --> 17:30.599
is the two 20-foot wings.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.099
Kari: Well, you'll notice

17:32.100 --> 17:34.132
that they are not an airfoil
like an actual airplane,

17:34.133 --> 17:35.899
because we're not trying
to create lift here.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.732

for our players to stand on.

17:39.367 --> 17:41.799
This thing is going down
the runway fast.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.199
So, this is a lot more sturdy

17:43.200 --> 17:44.932
than something you might find
in an airplane.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.132
I mean, we're not trying
to fly this thing.

We're trying to play tennis
on it.

Tory: We probably just want to
wing this paint job, huh?

17:52.567 --> 17:54.799

now that we've built our wing

17:54.800 --> 17:56.366
and we've got the measurements

17:56.367 --> 17:57.666
of the actual truck
we're going to use,

17:57.667 --> 17:59.666
it's time to build the thing
that connects the two,

which i call the tower.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.966
That's quite a thing.

It's got a lot of crossmembers
and supports.

18:05.433 --> 18:08.766
But without all those things,
the people on the wing

18:08.767 --> 18:11.666
would be flapping up and down
several inches,

making it
not only very dangerous

18:13.800 --> 18:16.466
but also damn near impossible
to play tennis.

18:16.467 --> 18:19.466

are super heavy-duty

18:19.467 --> 18:21.066
to brace the wing.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.466
It's a good thing
this thing doesn't have to fly.

welding, and triangulating,

Our build was just too big.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.866
The wings were too wide,
and we couldn't build it there.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.299
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able
to get it out the door,

18:44.300 --> 18:46.732
over the bridge, and through
the tunnel to the runway.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.066
Let's build a plane.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.832
So, we came out here
to an actual hangar,

18:51.833 --> 18:54.499
which is perfect, because
we're making an "airplane."

18:54.500 --> 18:59.066
And the best part is, behind
those giant doors is our runway.

18:59.067 --> 19:01.566

And it's not just the pieces of
Grant's flat-pack design

19:01.567 --> 19:03.299
they're unloading.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.899
It's like a giant erector set.

of their ground-bound plane

19:09.300 --> 19:11.399
has also arrived.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
All right.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.066
Well, that's landing.

19:14.067 --> 19:16.066
It's the red Byron.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.132
How about that, huh?

19:18.133 --> 19:21.866
Red baron, red Byron...
Ha!

19:21.867 --> 19:23.832
Grant: So, all of our pieces
have been unloaded,

19:23.833 --> 19:26.066
and now it's time for assembly.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.599
We're welding together
the two wing halves

19:27.600 --> 19:30.066
to give us a 40-foot wingspan.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.599
Nicely aligned.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.432
Next, we're welding this tower
onto the wings

19:34.433 --> 19:36.066
and adding extra supports

19:36.067 --> 19:39.300
so it'll give us
another 8 feet of height.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.766
And after we're done with that,
we flip it all over

19:47.767 --> 19:50.599
and put it on top
of this big-ass truck.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.066
This doesn't look dangerous
at all.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.066
Narrator:
At 15 feet off the ground,

19:55.067 --> 19:57.432
the guys may not
technically be flying,

19:57.433 --> 19:59.466
but they may as well be.

Oh, this just doesn't seem
like a good idea anymore.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.299
Kari:
This is terrifying.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.432
This is so high off the ground.

20:09.433 --> 20:11.299
If this thing flexes at all,

20:11.300 --> 20:13.799
one of them
is wetting their pants.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.766
Narrator: And with 40,000 pounds
of steel in place,

20:16.767 --> 20:19.732
the guys weld it
to the truck bed.

20:19.733 --> 20:23.466
I would have to say, out of all
the welds on this thing,

20:23.467 --> 20:26.200
these are probably
the most important.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.432
Kari: Yeah!

20:31.433 --> 20:34.532
Grant: There you go.
Like a glove.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.999
Perfect.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.332
Just like we planned it.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.566
All right, so our makeshift
airplane is finally complete.

20:40.567 --> 20:43.266
We've got a 40-foot wingspan

20:43.267 --> 20:46.766
that is supported by about 4,000
pounds of steel and cabling.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.266
It should be very sturdy.

20:48.267 --> 20:50.799
We have our safety rigs in place
so the boys will be safe.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.599
We have an anemometer
strapped up there

20:52.600 --> 20:54.466
so that we can get
precision wind speeds.

20:54.467 --> 20:57.299
It's completely supported
by a turbo-diesel tow truck.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.600
Now all we've got to do
is try it out on the runway.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.399
Narrator: Yep.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.299
After four days
of intense endeavor...

21:11.300 --> 21:13.099
Tory: This is awesome.

21:13.100 --> 21:16.766
They now have the closest
thing possible to a plane.

21:16.767 --> 21:20.299
This is definitely something
you don't see every day.

21:20.300 --> 21:24.132
So, with their no-fly zone
established,

21:24.133 --> 21:26.667
it's game on for this myth.

are at the end of their rope

for an apple on a bungee cord.

So now, we've got our height
and our weight dialed in

21:46.333 --> 21:48.866
to where our heads
are penetrating the water

21:48.867 --> 21:50.466
just a few inches.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.432
And we've also
nailed the accuracy.

21:52.433 --> 21:54.366
Yeah!

21:54.367 --> 21:57.066
So now it's time
to bring in the hard part,

biting onto one of these

one of these,

your teeth or your nose.

first.

ready to go for an apple?

I don't need to stand
on ceremony to tell you

really don't want to do it,

getting himself rigged up.

And all we need to do is fill
our barrel with some apples.

But wrapping his jaws around
an apple in the blink of an eye

22:50.100 --> 22:52.099
isn't going to be easy.

22:52.100 --> 22:55.432
Getting this done at this point
is all about finesse.

22:55.433 --> 22:59.699
It's all going to come down to
an inch or two of depth

relative to those apples.

just get right there

those apples

having them rocket away from me.

How are you feeling?

Horrible. [ Laughs ]

I didn't hit the target.

23:38.700 --> 23:42.932
I'm not sure whether
that was me or the lineup.

23:42.933 --> 23:46.366
Even a little gust of wind
is enough to push you off.

a whole lot of choice.

Either I'm going
right into the ring or I'm not.

23:50.967 --> 23:54.266
So, Jamie missed the target but
not in a direction we expected.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.432
And he missed it
because of that flag.

23:56.433 --> 23:58.499
No, no, no, not because
of politics or anything.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.499
Because of the wind
that is blowing that flag

24:00.500 --> 24:03.732
blew him slightly off target.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.866

targeting Jamie's jump

is nowhere near as reliable
as earlier.

All of the apples bobbed out
of the path of Jamie's jaws.

So, he bit down
on the only thing not moving.

here without something.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.866

25:06.867 --> 25:10.566
the stress equivalent
of having an automobile crash.

And i was desperate
to get that apple.

i couldn't do it.

for this myth yet.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.067
the mythbusters
are finally cleared to fly.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.966

as our two best tennis players
serve up some science.

you see the two tennis players

25:51.067 --> 25:54.066
rally about 20 times
back and forth.

25:54.067 --> 25:56.499
But, for us, we're only
going to try to do five,

25:56.500 --> 25:58.332
because we figure
five is enough.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.299
That's going to
prove the concept.

26:00.300 --> 26:01.466

we can confirm this myth.

a massive headwind,

26:13.400 --> 26:16.099

just be harnessed to the wing.

Now that you've proved
you can do it at this distance,

out further onto the wing

like the video.

But now what the mythbusters
want to know is,

31:21.533 --> 31:25.399
could you bungee Bob
with an apple apparatus?

So, we've got build a machine

that can be strapped to the head
that can catch an apple.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.132
What about using something like

There we go.

31:40.467 --> 31:43.632
My first thought is
something like a bear trap,

off of your jaw,

40:33.067 --> 40:35.132
The bungee cords
didn't go long enough.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.899
Cycling quickly
should take care of that.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.899
And the target was a little off
because the wind has picked up.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.399
So, we're going to move it
about 18 inches that way.

40:42.400 --> 40:46.132
And, hopefully, this is the last
dive he has to ever do, ever.

40:46.133 --> 40:48.232
Narrator:
Well, i think we can safely say

40:48.233 --> 40:50.466
that Jamie hopes that, too.

40:50.467 --> 40:51.966
Yeah, i tell you what.

40:51.967 --> 40:54.999
I've got to get it on this one,
or that's it.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.032
I've had enough.
This is...

40:57.033 --> 41:00.099
It's just... it's all too weird.
The tension is building.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.299
It's starting to get to me.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.266
Narrator:
Jamie's fear of heights

41:04.267 --> 41:08.432
is trumping the desire
to replicate the circumstances.

41:08.433 --> 41:13.299
So, this will be
his final bite of the apple.

41:13.300 --> 41:16.133
All right, Jamie.
Whenever you're ready.

41:17.367 --> 41:19.499
The wind has gusted.

41:19.500 --> 41:22.500
Man: You've got a strong
east wind right now at the flag.

41:25.933 --> 41:27.299
What do you think?

41:27.300 --> 41:29.532
I think we can get this done.

41:29.533 --> 41:30.933
Okay.

41:34.167 --> 41:37.799
I'm going to have you lean out,
and we're going to go for it.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
Okay.

41:38.801 --> 41:41.066
Okay, here we go!

41:41.067 --> 41:47.633
5... 4... 3... 2... 1.

41:52.733 --> 41:54.532
[ Grunts ]

41:54.533 --> 41:57.067
Adam: [ Laughs ]

42:00.900 --> 42:03.066
Narrator:
That was an epic attempt.

42:03.067 --> 42:05.200
And when you play it
in real time...

42:08.633 --> 42:13.232
Jamie had hardly a second
to operate the jaws.

42:13.233 --> 42:14.766
Well, he got something.

42:14.767 --> 42:18.566
Jamie's got a taste for that
ring, and he's never letting go.

42:18.567 --> 42:20.166
How are you feeling, captain?

42:20.167 --> 42:21.167
[ Laughs ]

42:21.168 --> 42:22.266
[ Whines ]

42:22.267 --> 42:24.399
In theory,
this thing could grab an apple.

42:24.400 --> 42:28.532
But how many times am i going to
have to do it to get it right?

42:28.533 --> 42:30.299
And, i mean, I'm up there.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.199
And it's... it's...
It's just all too weird.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.899
You know what? It is.
I mean, look at me.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.166
[ Laughs ] I know.

42:37.167 --> 42:38.299
I'm upside down.

42:38.300 --> 42:39.366
As if it's not bad enough,

42:39.367 --> 42:40.699
you've got this
stuck to your head.

42:40.700 --> 42:42.566
"Aah! What's happening?

42:42.567 --> 42:44.232
Let me out of here."

42:44.233 --> 42:45.966
That's it.
We're calling it.

42:45.967 --> 42:47.632
Bobbing for apples is busted.

42:47.633 --> 42:49.632
Bobbing with
a what-would-it-take rig

42:49.633 --> 42:51.466
on your head...
Maybe, maybe not.

42:51.467 --> 42:53.699
Who cares? I'm going home.
We're done.

42:53.700 --> 42:57.099
In a final analysis,
Jamie performed like a champion.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.699
He made the dive.

42:58.700 --> 43:00.632
He made many, many, many dives.

43:00.633 --> 43:02.332
He hit the target perfectly,

43:02.333 --> 43:03.899
except the wind
had twisted him around.

43:03.900 --> 43:05.499
And instead of an apple,
he got a ring.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.599
But we are calling it there.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.832
We have found
the hyneman's limit.

43:09.833 --> 43:11.599
We have found
the savage's limit.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.466
It would have been your limit,
too.

43:13.467 --> 43:15.066
This myth is totally busted.

43:15.067 --> 43:18.232
You cannot Bob for apples
from the end of a bungee cord.

43:18.233 --> 43:19.233
Well, that's it.

43:19.234 --> 43:20.599
You got anything clever to say

43:20.600 --> 43:22.266
for the walk
off into the sunset?

43:22.267 --> 43:23.799
[ Crunches ]

43:23.800 --> 43:25.600
Nice. Goodbye.
