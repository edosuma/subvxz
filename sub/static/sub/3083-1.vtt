<i>We are here with Rich Mullins,</i>

<i>one of contemporary Christian
music's biggest stars.</i>

04:47.204 --> 04:48.872
<i>Rich, welcome to the show.</i>

<i>Rich, we know

04:50.817 --> 04:54.336
<i>Awesome God, Sing Your Praise
to the Lord and Elijah, among others.</i>

04:54.420 --> 04:56.797
<i>You've been at the top
of the COM charts,</i>

04:56.839 --> 04:59.174
<i>had a number
of Dove Award nominations,</i>

04:59.258 --> 05:00.634
<i>but I want to talk
a little bit</i>

05:00.718 --> 05:02.636
about the man
behind the music

05:02.678 --> 05:04.555
so if you don't mind will
you tell us a little bit

05:04.638 --> 05:07.725
about how you came
to faith in Christ?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.059
Well, Randy, I'm not
a Christian

05:09.143 --> 05:10.294
because of a song
I heard

05:10.378 --> 05:12.730
or a book I read,
as much as I like to read.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.066
Uh, I came to experience
the realness of Christ

05:16.150 --> 05:18.569
through the people
in his church.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.638
<i>I'm a Christian, not because</i>

05:20.721 --> 05:23.907
somebody explained the nuts and
bolts of Christianity to me but

05:23.991 --> 05:26.702
because people were willing
to be the nuts and bolts.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.712
Come on,
let's go!

05:49.933 --> 05:51.643
<i>I guess you could say
my story began</i>

05:51.727 --> 05:53.562
<i>in a small town
in Indiana.</i>

05:57.524 --> 05:59.777
<i>My dad was a farmer</i>

05:59.860 --> 06:03.447
<i>and easily, easily the hardest
working man that I know.</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:04.857
<i>Like most boys,
I grew up</i>

06:04.941 --> 06:08.619
<i>wanting to be exactly like him,
exactly like my dad.</i>

06:08.702 --> 06:11.789
<i>But I discovered
at a pretty early age,</i>

06:11.872 --> 06:14.041
<i>time and time again that</i>

06:14.124 --> 06:16.085
<i>I wasn't really cut
out to be a farmer.</i>

06:28.389 --> 06:29.723
Hold the light.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.266
What's wrong
with it, Dad?

06:31.350 --> 06:33.060
<i>Damn light, son!</i>

06:40.692 --> 06:43.737
It's the pistons.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.155
What did you
fill it with?

06:45.239 --> 06:47.825
Gasoline.
Like you said.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.576
Like I said?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.286
<i>Not like I said,
'cause I didn't say</i>

06:51.370 --> 06:53.956
<i>I didn't say
nothing about gasoline.</i>

06:54.039 --> 06:57.334
<i>Of all
the damn fool things.</i>

06:57.418 --> 06:58.585
Lean over here, boy.
Come here.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.797
<i>What's that say?</i>

07:01.880 --> 07:03.340
Speak up, Wayne!
What's it say?

07:03.424 --> 07:04.591
"Diesel."

07:04.675 --> 07:09.012
That's right.
Diesel.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.850
Because you can't put
gasoline in the tractor, son.

07:12.933 --> 07:13.934
I'm sorry, Dad.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.354
Well, sorry isn't going
to fix this, boy.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.772
Damn!

07:35.789 --> 07:39.126
<i>My mom and dad
raised five of us kids</i>

07:39.168 --> 07:43.797
<i>and, you know, most of the time
money was pretty scarce.</i>

07:43.839 --> 07:46.216
<i>And when I was little, my
baby brother passed a way.</i>

07:46.300 --> 07:49.470
<i>And that was
often hard for them.</i>

07:49.511 --> 07:51.763
<i>Even as a boy,
I wanted to help.</i>

07:56.059 --> 07:59.730
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

07:59.813 --> 08:01.857
<i>Why didn't you tell me
you got the tractor</i>

08:01.940 --> 08:05.235
<i>stuck in the field
this morning?</i>

08:05.319 --> 08:06.528
<i>Speak up, Do)'-</i>

08:06.612 --> 08:08.697
I thought
you'd be mad.

08:08.780 --> 08:12.993
I just don't understand why
everything you touch ends up busted.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.234
<i>I wish you'd be
more gentle with him.</i>

08:45.317 --> 08:49.363
<i>More gentle?</i>

08:49.446 --> 08:51.281
That's the last
thing to be.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.534
<i>He needs to toughen up,
that's what.</i>

08:53.617 --> 08:55.702
<i>He's got his damn
head in the clouds.</i>

08:55.744 --> 08:57.871
He needs to know
you love him.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.207
That boy needs to stay
away from the tractor.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.043
<i>Last week,
it was the engine.</i>

09:03.126 --> 09:04.545
<i>Today he got not one,</i>

09:04.628 --> 09:06.964
but four wheels
stuck in holes.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.716
- John, he's just trying...
- Four, Neva.

09:09.758 --> 09:13.387
Four.  The repairs
cost 300 dollars,

09:13.470 --> 09:15.639
not to mention the
lost time on the farm.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.308
Ain't going to be worried about love

09:18.392 --> 09:20.269
if he is going
hungry, will he?

09:29.820 --> 09:32.656
He's our oldest boy, Neva.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.275
If he doesn't learn,

09:34.358 --> 09:38.328
then how is he going to
take over the farm one day?

09:38.412 --> 09:43.166
Maybe he's not
meant for the farm.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.878
You're a good father.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.258
Hm.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.018
She got it.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.605
She did,
didn't she?

10:11.278 --> 10:14.281
<i>Dad, that's it.</i>

10:14.323 --> 10:16.533
<i>What are you
doing, boy?</i>

10:16.617 --> 10:18.285
John!

10:20.162 --> 10:21.872
Didn't you
like it, Mom?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.750
Yes. Yes,
it's wonderful.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.047
John...

10:37.929 --> 10:39.723
<i>As I got older,
music seemed to be</i>

10:39.806 --> 10:41.391
<i>the only thing
that made sense to me.</i>

10:41.475 --> 10:43.393
<i>I was pretty good at it</i>

10:43.477 --> 10:46.229
<i>and there was something
about sitting at a piano</i>

10:46.313 --> 10:50.317
<i>that just made me feel
like I was home.</i>

10:57.157 --> 10:59.493
<i>How do you think
that God views you?</i>

10:59.576 --> 11:02.162
Have you asked
yourself this?

11:02.204 --> 11:03.747
You should,

11:03.830 --> 11:05.874
<i>because your perception
of God</i>

11:05.957 --> 11:10.087
<i>will have an effect on
every aspect of your life.</i>

11:10.170 --> 11:12.005
<i>In the Book of Romans,</i>

11:12.047 --> 11:15.842
<i>Paul quoting Isaiah
speaks to the truth that</i>

11:15.926 --> 11:19.680
no one is righteous,
how we are all sinners.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.724
<i>But God commanded
his love toward us.</i>

11:24.935 --> 11:28.230
- That was wonderful, Richard.
- Thank you, Mrs. Kellner.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.108
Now why don't you play
it how it was written?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.527
<i>Time to go, son.</i>

11:33.610 --> 11:35.612
He is
my best student.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.698
<i>Well, at least there's
one thing he's good at.</i>

11:37.781 --> 11:38.949
<i>It sure isn't farming.</i>

11:39.032 --> 11:40.492
<i>Let's get, boy.</i>

11:45.205 --> 11:46.873
<i>Growing up, people
would always tell me</i>

11:46.915 --> 11:48.667
<i>that God
loved me</i>

11:48.750 --> 11:50.293
<i>but I had a hard time believing that.</i>

11:50.377 --> 11:54.089
<i>I wondered
if God even liked me.</i>

11:54.172 --> 11:58.927
<i>Maybe it's because people also
told me that my dad loved me.</i>

11:59.010 --> 12:02.264
<i>I mean, my dad and I didn't
connect or we couldn't connect.</i>

12:02.347 --> 12:04.133
<i>The things
he knew and understood</i>

12:04.216 --> 12:08.103
<i>weren't things I knew and
understood and vice versa.</i>

12:08.186 --> 12:12.149
<i>They say that time
heals all wounds</i>

12:12.232 --> 12:14.276
<i>but honestly in our case
it just made things worse.</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:23.326
I hate
being different.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.748
I think God knows
what he's doing, Wayne.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.834
Dad hates it, too.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.420
Your father
loves you.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.505
No, he loves
Dave and Lloyd.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.591
He understands them.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.344
<i>He loves
all of you.</i>

12:41.428 --> 12:43.930
Sometimes I just wish
I was more like them.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.977
I don't belong here.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.649
<i>God's got big plans for you.</i>

12:54.733 --> 12:55.984
<i>I know it.</i>

12:58.111 --> 13:00.781
You are going to do
great things one day.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.464
<i>After high school,</i>

13:17.547 --> 13:19.883
<i>I wasn't sure what
I was going to do.</i>

13:19.966 --> 13:21.843
<i>Home had became a place</i>

13:21.927 --> 13:25.472
<i>where you had to learn
the language of silence.</i>

13:25.514 --> 13:28.809
<i>My dad and I grew apart.</i>

13:28.850 --> 13:34.768
<i>Uh, you know, he grew inward
and I grew bitter.</i>

13:35.899 --> 13:39.569
<i>At that time, my rebellion
was in full swing.</i>

13:39.653 --> 13:42.155
<i>Uh, let's just say
that surrender</i>

13:42.197 --> 13:45.242
<i>doesn't exactly
come naturally to me.</i>

13:45.325 --> 13:47.327
<i>But I quickly learned
that God</i>

13:47.410 --> 13:49.663
<i>can speak to us in some
pretty unexpected ways.</i>

13:53.917 --> 13:57.921
<i>How do you respond to these
accusations from your father?</i>

13:58.004 --> 14:02.884
<i>Do you dare defy the
ordinances of Holy Mother Church ?</i>

14:02.968 --> 14:06.054
<i>How can you stand there
in defiance of your father?</i>

14:06.137 --> 14:08.181
<i>You're bestowed with
riches beyond your worth</i>

14:08.223 --> 14:10.016
<i>and now
you rebuke their value?</i>

14:10.058 --> 14:14.145
<i>By what authority
do you do such things?</i>

14:15.814 --> 14:19.442
<i>I want to live
a life of freedom.</i>

14:19.526 --> 14:21.194
<i>I want to be as free</i>

14:21.236 --> 14:23.905
<i>as the animals
that roam this earth,</i>

14:23.989 --> 14:27.033
<i>as free as the moon
in the night sky.</i>

14:27.117 --> 14:30.745
<i>These earthly possessions,</i>

14:30.829 --> 14:34.249
<i>this noble stature,</i>

14:34.332 --> 14:39.212
<i>the adoration that our
society craves is no use to me.</i>

14:39.296 --> 14:41.256
<i>But you're my son.</i>

14:41.339 --> 14:43.633
<i>I'm no longer
your son.</i>

14:43.717 --> 14:46.261
<i>Saint Francis was wild.
I mean,</i>

14:46.344 --> 14:48.722
<i>he fell madly in
love with Jesus.</i>

14:48.763 --> 14:51.725
<i>As a result of that, he
gave up everything he had.</i>

14:51.808 --> 14:53.894
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

14:53.977 --> 14:56.897
<i>God calls
to every man.</i>

14:56.938 --> 15:00.609
<i>But not every man responds.</i>

15:00.692 --> 15:02.277
<i>I connected to the story
of Saint Francis</i>

15:02.360 --> 15:04.321
<i>in a lot of ways.</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:07.908
<i>You know, he just had
this radical trust in Christ.</i>

15:07.991 --> 15:10.994
<i>It was a trust
that I didn't have.</i>

15:11.077 --> 15:13.330
<i>But I wanted it.</i>

15:13.413 --> 15:16.750
<i>I knew that deep down if I
wanted to grow that kind of faith,</i>

15:16.791 --> 15:20.587
<i>it wasn't going to happen
by staying at home.</i>

15:20.629 --> 15:21.671
<i>So I left.</i>

15:52.160 --> 15:53.828
<i>You know, it's interesting.</i>

15:53.912 --> 15:55.956
<i>I had reached
a point in my life</i>

15:56.039 --> 15:57.874
<i>where I decided to get
serious about my faith</i>

15:57.958 --> 16:01.252
<i>before I had no faith
to get serious about.</i>

16:01.336 --> 16:03.088
<i>Not that going
to Bible College</i>

16:03.171 --> 16:04.339
<i>is particularly
the place to get serious</i>

16:04.422 --> 16:06.091
<i>about your faith</i>

16:06.174 --> 16:08.218
<i>but nevertheless,
that's where I went.</i>

16:22.315 --> 16:24.818
Hey! What are you
doing with my stuff?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.528
Oh, I thought
this would be okay.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.405
- I prefer to sleep with my...
- You thought...

16:28.488 --> 16:30.740
this would be okay?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.409
Let me ask you
a question.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.035
You ever stare danger
straight in the eye

16:34.119 --> 16:37.330
and live
to tell about it?

16:37.372 --> 16:38.415
Name's Sam.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.209
Just joking, man.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.585
You must be Rich.
Yeah.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.087
Yeah, nice
to meet you, man.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.055
You scared me there
for a second.

16:45.139 --> 16:47.298
I've got kind of a weird
sense of humor.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.842
You should know
that up front.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.677
Hey, I think
that's everything.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.053
<i>Your mom and I are
going to head back.</i>

16:52.137 --> 16:53.221
<i>So...
Cool.</i>

16:53.304 --> 16:54.431
Oh, hi.
I'm Morris.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.724
Hey,Dad.
Hi, Morris.

16:55.807 --> 16:56.975
I'm Rich.
I'm the dad.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.268
It's nice
to meet you.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.936
You can go
now, Dad.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.021
Yeah, we're going
to head back.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.689
Love you, Pops.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.190
<i>I love you, too, man.</i>

17:04.273 --> 17:05.900
You guys have fun.
We'll see you.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.777
- There you go.
- Nice to meet you, Morris.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.779
<i>Hey, um...</i>

17:09.863 --> 17:11.698
I got
a question for you.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.700
<i>You seem kind of like
a handsome guy.</i>

17:13.742 --> 17:15.952
I wasn't really popular
with the girls in high school

17:16.036 --> 17:18.204
so I want you
to shoot me straight.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.915
Does this, uh, beard
make me look fat?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.627
- No, serious.
- I don't know how to answer that question.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.380
<i>That's fair enough.
That's fair enough.</i>

17:29.340 --> 17:30.717
Oh, man.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.218
<i>So you're a bully.</i>

17:44.814 --> 17:49.736
<i>My time at CBC
kind of flew by fast.</i>

17:49.778 --> 17:53.656
<i>Sam and I hit it off well and
became good friends quickly.</i>

17:55.450 --> 17:57.160
<i>Being in
a structured institution,</i>

17:57.243 --> 17:58.953
<i>I found myself asking
a lot of questions</i>

17:59.037 --> 18:01.623
<i>about the church,
about authority.</i>

18:01.706 --> 18:04.000
<i>They weren't always
popular with the faculty.</i>

18:04.084 --> 18:07.128
oh, you play?

18:07.212 --> 18:08.922
Yeah, absolutely.
I play all the time.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.507
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, I saw the case.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.758
- You want to jam?
- Yeah!

18:11.800 --> 18:13.593
<i>Yeah.
For sure.</i>

18:13.635 --> 18:16.638
<i>Sam and I formed
a small band called Zion.</i>

18:16.721 --> 18:19.766
<i>We started off playing at small
coffeeshops around Cincinnati,</i>

18:19.808 --> 18:23.311
<i>and then eventually
in church auditoriums.</i>

18:23.394 --> 18:25.105
<i>The more I played,
the more I realized</i>

18:25.188 --> 18:27.190
<i>that I didn't want
to just play music.</i>

18:27.273 --> 18:30.527
<i>I wanted a ministry.</i>

18:30.610 --> 18:32.654
<i>So we moved off campus
our senior year</i>

18:32.737 --> 18:35.115
<i>with a couple of the other
members of the band.</i>

18:35.156 --> 18:38.159
<i>It was exciting to feel
God working through me</i>

18:38.243 --> 18:42.622
<i>even on a small stage
like Cincinnati.</i>

18:52.048 --> 18:54.968
He is incredible.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.177
He's pretty good.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.766
There he
goes again.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.732
Richard.
Richard.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.109
I thought I told you
you weren't allowed

19:11.192 --> 19:13.069
to play
on campus anymore.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.363
Especially if you're bent
on destroying another piano.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.407
Mr. Walters,
I'm sorry.

19:17.490 --> 19:22.829
I asked Richard to play for
orientation.  It's my fault.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.431
Monday morning,

19:24.514 --> 19:27.208
I want you prepared to quote
the first chapter of Isaiah

19:27.292 --> 19:29.252
in my office
eight a.m. sharp.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.920
I can do that.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.758
Break it up.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.260
It was so good.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.761
Take it easy.
It was just one song.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.146
It was great.
It really was.

19:40.188 --> 19:41.848
I see the Scripture Police got you.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.766
- You noticed that, huh?
- I did.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.686
Thankfully, he's given
me that chapter before.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.563
<i>Man, what's up
with that guy?</i>

19:48.646 --> 19:50.440
It's ridiculous.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.943
Hi. Um, that
was incredible.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.862
I've never heard anything
like that before, ever.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.449
Um, I'm...  hi, I'm Beth.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.909
I'm Rich.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.952
- Nice to meet you.
- You sing?

20:03.036 --> 20:06.539
Uh, yeah.  I mean, just at, like,

20:06.623 --> 20:08.625
church at home.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.084
You should sing
with our band, Zion.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.794
You've never
heard me play.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.988
I mean, sing.

20:13.071 --> 20:15.351
Oh, I'm sure you're fine.
Jesus isn't picky.

20:17.342 --> 20:20.303
Um, this is
my friend, Jess.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.137
Say hi.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.155
<i>Hey!</i>

20:22.239 --> 20:23.232
<i>That was great.</i>

20:23.315 --> 20:25.433
You, too. Or not.
Not you too.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.101
I don't... I don't sing at all.

20:27.185 --> 20:31.481
No, that's not
what I meant. Um...

20:31.564 --> 20:33.900
It was nice
to meet you.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.653
Yeah.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.488
We'll see
you around?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.198
Yep.
Got it.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.080
Ah. She's pretty, huh?

20:47.121 --> 20:49.249
<i>Pretty cute.</i>

20:51.793 --> 20:53.419
<i>I tried my best
to ignore her</i>

20:53.461 --> 20:56.172
<i>and just focus
on Zion or school.</i>

20:56.256 --> 20:58.925
<i>But I couldn't help it.</i>

20:58.967 --> 21:02.762
<i>Uh, from the moment
I met Jess, I...</i>

21:02.804 --> 21:04.597
<i>I couldn't get her
out of my mind.</i>

21:06.683 --> 21:08.601
Sorry about the car.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.187
I pretended to know, like
I know something about cars

21:11.271 --> 21:12.855
for as long as I could
and keep it up.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.224
I think I figured it
out pretty quickly.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.942
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's all right.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.694
I'll stick
with the piano.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.029
Hold on.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.115
There are a lot of really
amazing doors on this campus

21:22.156 --> 21:23.491
but these are
probably my favorite.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.451
They're beautiful.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.120
- You want to sit for a bit?
- Sure.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.290
Do you write?

21:30.373 --> 21:32.709
Some.
A journal

21:32.792 --> 21:34.627
Journal?

21:34.669 --> 21:38.006
- How morose of you.
- Hmm.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.674
What do you
write about?

21:39.757 --> 21:43.469
Oh, my dreams.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.680
Fears.

21:45.763 --> 21:50.393
Dreams about what?

21:50.476 --> 21:51.686
<i>About the man I'll marry</i>

21:51.769 --> 21:53.021
and settle down with.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.318
The house we'll live in.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.361
The kids.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.446
The dog.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.158
That's what you
want most.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.776
Yeah.

22:06.860 --> 22:10.747
<i>Yeah, a home and
someone to share it with.</i>

22:10.830 --> 22:13.708
<i>What about your fears?</i>

22:13.791 --> 22:16.961
Being alone.

22:17.045 --> 22:21.007
No, I mean...

22:21.049 --> 22:26.179
I'm terrified
of myself sometimes,

22:26.262 --> 22:30.683
of this loneliness I feel
inside of me.  It's like, um...

22:30.767 --> 22:32.518
it's like a black hole or something.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.862
<i>Even when you're as close as
you can be to another person,</i>

22:42.945 --> 22:47.367
even when you're touching.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.369
That's exactly it.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.206
Feel alone now?

23:18.064 --> 23:21.275
<i>Jess and I were immediately
drawn to each other.</i>

23:21.359 --> 23:22.535
<i>Over the next few months,</i>

23:22.536 --> 23:25.613
<i>I spent some of the most
meaningful days of my life with her</i>

23:25.696 --> 23:29.158
<i>and learning
each other's stories,</i>

23:29.242 --> 23:30.410
<i>and sharing dreams.</i>

23:35.540 --> 23:39.043
<i>We were just two lonely people
who had found each other in the dark.</i>

23:48.970 --> 23:51.764
<i>When I was with Jess,
I felt...</i>

23:51.848 --> 23:55.768
<i>I felt something
I hadn't felt in a long time.</i>

23:55.852 --> 23:57.145
<i>I felt like I was home.</i>

24:04.318 --> 24:10.116
♪    Life goes on    ♪
and so must the song

24:10.158 --> 24:13.286
♪ Doo doo doooo doo ♪

24:24.464 --> 24:26.799
♪ Sing your praise to the Lord ♪

24:26.841 --> 24:29.343

24:29.427 --> 24:32.221
♪ Hallelujah, sing your ♪
praise to the Lord

24:32.305 --> 24:34.891
♪ I can never tell you ♪
- I love it.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.560
Is that the guy?

24:37.643 --> 24:38.644
I love it.

24:40.188 --> 24:44.233
I want to do this one.
Bryan?

24:44.317 --> 24:45.818
It's very different.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.154
I like different.
I'm sick of the same.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.530
I want to do this song.

24:49.614 --> 24:53.493
Yeah.  I'm with Amy on this.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.996
It's a good song.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.708
<i>I'll make
the call.</i>

25:00.791 --> 25:02.585
<i>Rich!
Richard!</i>

25:02.668 --> 25:03.794
Rich! Pick
up the phone!

25:03.878 --> 25:05.140
Right here.

25:05.146 --> 25:06.540
- Get on the phone right now!
- Who is it?

25:06.581 --> 25:09.717
- What are you freaking out about?
- It's Nashville!

25:09.800 --> 25:11.568
The city of Nashville is calling?

25:11.569 --> 25:15.515
No, it's some guy from a record
label that represents Amy Grant.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.850
<i>And he wants to talk to you!</i>

25:17.892 --> 25:19.519
- Did you do this?
- No!

25:19.602 --> 25:21.521
- Was it Gary?
- It wasn't me.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.856
It's Beth. This had to have
been Beth.  Beth!

25:28.152 --> 25:29.779
<i>Just pick
up the phone.</i>

25:29.862 --> 25:30.696
<i>Turn it off.</i>

25:30.780 --> 25:32.031
Hello?

25:32.114 --> 25:33.533
Yes, is this
Rich Mullins?

25:33.574 --> 25:35.243
This is Rich Mullins.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.570
Rich, this is Bryan
Bontrager from Nashville.

25:37.612 --> 25:40.706
What can I do for you
Bryan Bontrager from Nashville?

25:40.748 --> 25:42.492
<i>Rich,</i>

25:42.575 --> 25:46.087
<i>Amy Grant heard your song
Sing Your Praise to the Lord</i>

25:46.170 --> 25:49.131
and she wants to use it
on her next album.

25:49.215 --> 25:53.302
- Who's Amy Grant?
- Are you kidding me?  Oh!

25:53.386 --> 25:55.137
Excuse me?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.557
Shhh.
Sorry about that. Go ahead.

25:57.598 --> 26:00.643
Okay, well, um,
listen, Rich,

26:00.726 --> 26:02.395
we'd like to bring you
down to Nashville

26:02.478 --> 26:04.230
here so we can work
out the writing contract.

26:04.272 --> 26:07.400
Wow, thanks
Bryan, but, uh,

26:07.483 --> 26:09.318
<i>I'm not really
interested.</i>

26:09.402 --> 26:11.988
You're not interested?

26:13.239 --> 26:15.358
<i>Um, look Rich,</i>

26:15.441 --> 26:18.744
I don't think you understand
what we're offering you here, okay?

26:18.828 --> 26:20.955
<i>This is a game changer.</i>

26:21.038 --> 26:23.165
I'm not really sure I want
my game to be changed.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.960
Okay, well, um, Rich,

26:26.043 --> 26:28.754
maybe you should
think about this.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.632
You have a real gift

26:31.716 --> 26:33.009
and maybe you
should be using it.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.012
Well, I think
I am using it.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.348
All right, well, um,

26:39.432 --> 26:42.268
I,uh,hope
you change your mind.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.120
Well, thanks for the call, Bryan.
I appreciate it.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.396
Take care.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.783
What?

27:19.388 --> 27:21.474
<i>When are we going to talk
about the Nashville thing?</i>

27:25.061 --> 27:27.163
We're not going to talk
about the Nashville thing

27:27.246 --> 27:29.398
because I'm not going to Nashville.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.026
You have to go.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.669
Well, are you
coming with me?

27:33.670 --> 27:36.405
You know I can't do that.
We're not even married yet.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.657
What is this?

27:37.740 --> 27:39.533
Is this
your parents?

27:39.617 --> 27:42.244
It's not just
my parents.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.873
You knew
what I wanted.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.375
Your life
is headed

27:47.458 --> 27:49.877
in a totally
different direction.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.422
You don't want to be 41
and stuck in Cincinnati.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.092
Yes, I do.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.843
If you're there,
I do.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.016
You don't belong here.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.876
<i>Hey, Jess,
it's me, uh...</i>

28:30.918 --> 28:32.586
<i>hey, I didn't see you
at the show tonight.</i>

28:32.670 --> 28:34.255
<i>I thought you were
going to be there.</i>

28:34.338 --> 28:35.881
<i>Um...just give
me a call.</i>

29:05.411 --> 29:07.121
<i>I just don't understand</i>

29:07.204 --> 29:08.998
<i>why everything
you touch ends up busted.</i>

29:09.081 --> 29:11.167
<i>Why everything
you touch ends up busted.</i>

29:15.588 --> 29:17.757
<i>Hey, hey, Jess,
it's me.</i>

29:17.840 --> 29:21.677
Listen, call me when you
get this, I just want to talk.

29:21.761 --> 29:25.931
I just, I just feel
like we're not...

29:25.973 --> 29:29.810
I just, I just want to talk about
what's happening with us.

29:29.894 --> 29:32.146
<i>I was just calling to make
sure everything is okay.</i>

29:34.356 --> 29:35.440
<i>I just feel like
we're not connecting</i>

29:35.441 --> 29:37.401
<i>and I don't know...</i>

29:37.443 --> 29:39.779
why we keep
going back and forth

29:39.862 --> 29:41.363
and if there's something
I've done or...

29:47.328 --> 29:50.664
<i>Jess, if the problem is me,
then I just want you to tell me.</i>

30:10.267 --> 30:11.477
Hello?

30:11.560 --> 30:13.687
Hey, Mom.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.314
Are you okay?

30:15.356 --> 30:18.192
I was just missing...
missing you guys.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.819
<i>I just wanted
to say hi.</i>

30:19.860 --> 30:22.822
Neva, I get
up at 4 a.m.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.824
Calm yourself.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.867
Mom, can I talk to
Dad for a second?

30:26.951 --> 30:28.828
Yeah.

30:28.911 --> 30:30.996
Hey, he wants
to talk to you.

30:31.080 --> 30:37.253
Tell that boy to call back at a
decent hour and I'll talk to him.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.171
He said to say
that he loves you

30:39.255 --> 30:41.590
<i>and that
he'll call you later.</i>

30:41.674 --> 30:43.092
He didn't say
that, Mom.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.511
You know your father loves you.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.763
He just has to be at work.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.391
Neva, this is not the time
for his nonsense.

30:50.474 --> 30:53.060
Hang up the damn phone.

30:53.143 --> 30:55.604
<i>He's just tired.</i>

30:55.688 --> 30:58.566
Yeah. Well, sorry
for calling so late.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.026
All right.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.111
Love you.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.391
Hey, Rich.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.059
- Sam.
- Yeah.

31:34.101 --> 31:37.980
Come here.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.065
Where were you?

31:40.149 --> 31:42.818
Have you been drinking?
Answer me!

31:42.902 --> 31:44.403
Gary and I
went to a movie.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.033
Why didn't you
ask me to go?

31:49.116 --> 31:50.618
<i>Dude, I think you
need to sleep it off.</i>

31:50.701 --> 31:51.744
<i>I think you're drunk.</i>

31:51.827 --> 31:52.828
I'm fine.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.790
<i>I take it back.</i>

31:56.874 --> 31:58.751
I know you're drunk.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.128
Sleep it off.

32:04.715 --> 32:05.558
What's this?

32:05.642 --> 32:07.384
It's a camel.
What do you think it is?

32:07.468 --> 32:08.928
It's not a camel.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.348
<i>Sam.</i>

32:12.431 --> 32:14.433
Yeah?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.435
Are we
really friends?

32:20.230 --> 32:22.358
<i>Sam invited me
to come to Wichita</i>

32:22.441 --> 32:25.486
<i>with him to stay with his
folks and sort things out.</i>

32:25.569 --> 32:29.657
<i>The Nashville situation had thrown
a lot of my world out of joint.</i>

32:29.740 --> 32:32.284
<i>I wasn't totally sure
how to put it back.</i>

32:32.326 --> 32:36.455
<i>I think a large part of me worried
that what Jess had said was true.</i>

32:36.538 --> 32:37.790
<i>I had to go.</i>

32:40.292 --> 32:41.460
<i>Rich!</i>

32:43.712 --> 32:46.298
<i>I'll be right back.
We 're out of milk.</i>

32:46.340 --> 32:48.133
Could I talk to you
for a second, Morris?

32:48.175 --> 32:50.844
Yeah.
Absolutely.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.221
What's on your mind?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.890
Oh. Quite a lot.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.517
And Nashville.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.810
Yeah, you heard
about that?

32:57.893 --> 33:00.813
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.815
Yeah, Jessie
doesn't want to go

33:02.856 --> 33:05.693
and, um...

33:05.776 --> 33:07.528
she hates the whole idea
of touring but, man,

33:07.611 --> 33:09.363
I don't know how to
do this without her.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.574
You-you want to tour,
do your music.

33:12.658 --> 33:16.495
Yeah, absolutely.  I just
don't want to do it alone.

33:16.578 --> 33:20.165
Yeah.  Well, relationships
are funny that way.

33:20.207 --> 33:23.335
They don't necessarily fix
those kind of problems.

33:23.377 --> 33:26.422
And if you kind of give up
this dream for that dream,

33:26.505 --> 33:28.507
you might lose both of them.

33:28.549 --> 33:31.010
- Hm.
- It sort of happens that way sometimes.

33:31.093 --> 33:34.096
You know why I think
Jesus didn't have a girl?

33:34.179 --> 33:37.099
I am dying to hear
this one. Why?

33:37.182 --> 33:40.019
He didn't have a
home to take her to.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.688
The guy was a Vagabond,
I mean...

33:42.730 --> 33:44.940
The only thing I know is that
Jesus would not like Nashville.

33:45.024 --> 33:48.027
I mean... I just mean
all these cheesy artists

33:48.110 --> 33:50.070
like trying to make a
cheap buck off of his name.

33:50.079 --> 33:52.031
<i>The whole thing makes me
want to puke, to be honest.</i>

33:52.114 --> 33:54.700
Maybe that's why he
wants you to be a part of it.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.286
Yeah.  I don't know if God
needs me to change Nashville.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.954
Oh, I'm sure
he doesn't.

33:59.038 --> 34:02.207
But he still might
want you to be there.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.543
<i>It's just you have
to be careful</i>

34:04.585 --> 34:07.046
<i>thinking that holiness is
about finding the right place</i>

34:07.087 --> 34:09.130
and doing
the right things.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.550
Because it's
really not that.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.469
I mean, holiness
is really about

34:14.553 --> 34:17.139
loving God
in the moment.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.266
<i>I found in my own life
there are a lot of things I know</i>

34:19.349 --> 34:23.145
and there are some
things I don't know.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.065
But if I give it time,

34:26.148 --> 34:28.400
if I really walk
in faith on it,

34:28.484 --> 34:30.485
I don't have
answers to everything,

34:30.569 --> 34:33.739
but I've been amazed
at the things I found out.

34:33.781 --> 34:35.657
And the thing I know about it,

34:35.741 --> 34:37.659
is that God loves you
no matter what you choose.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.828
And he's
going to be there.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.748
He's going to be there
with you on this journey.

34:42.790 --> 34:44.583
All right. So what
about the girl?

34:44.625 --> 34:46.793
Yeah.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.670
Well, I don't know
everything about women...

34:51.215 --> 34:55.677
But I have been married to
one woman for almost 20 years.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.347
And the reason that
works is because

34:58.430 --> 35:01.475
she says, "Go get milk"
and I go get milk.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.519
And then I pick
up ice cream.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.522
Ooh, I hear you.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.190
Rocky Road.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.858
There is
no other kind.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.470
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks, Morris.

35:12.478 --> 35:13.862
All right, I'll see you.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.286
He still not here?

35:21.370 --> 35:23.372
He'll be here.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.625
I want to make sure we get
a few things clear before I go on.

35:26.708 --> 35:29.350
Hey man, we've done this before.
It's going to be okay.

35:29.353 --> 35:31.463
Not in my church.

35:31.505 --> 35:35.217
First off, you boys all better
find yourselves some shoes.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.885
This is a house of God.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.471
And clean up,
tuck your shirt tail in,

35:39.513 --> 35:41.723
have some self respect.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.893
I'm going to be talking
today about being holy,

35:44.977 --> 35:47.396
being disciplined,
and shaping up.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.148
And I want you
to play something

35:49.189 --> 35:51.650
that will really drive
that message home.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.490
You understand?

35:53.494 --> 35:55.904
And I hope you'll be out
there listening to my sermon.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.869
So, Gary, do you
want to tell Richard?

36:01.952 --> 36:05.414
<i>If you're going to get
serious about your faith,</i>

36:05.497 --> 36:08.500
you need to look at
this book like a rule book.

36:08.542 --> 36:12.754
It has the dos
and the don'ts.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.257
<i>Are you going
to follow the dos?</i>

36:15.340 --> 36:17.926
<i>Or you choose the don'ts?</i>

36:18.010 --> 36:20.721
As Zion comes up
to close us in song,

36:20.804 --> 36:23.724
I want to leave you
with this question.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.434
Would Christ
be proud of you?

36:42.034 --> 36:47.207
Yeah, I don't want to be disrespectful.
I know we're guests here, but...

36:48.248 --> 36:50.792
I kind of think how
disrespectful it would be

36:50.876 --> 36:54.129
not be honest with the church.

36:54.213 --> 36:57.299
<i>I think it was
the theologian Karl Barth</i>

36:57.382 --> 37:00.302
who was asked once
what's the most...

37:00.385 --> 37:05.474
What's the most theologically
profound statement

37:05.557 --> 37:09.311
and this is
how he responded.

37:09.394 --> 37:14.399
♪ Jesus loves me this I know ♪

37:17.069 --> 37:22.658
♪ For the Bible tells me so ♪

37:24.284 --> 37:29.623
♪ They're the ones to Him belong ♪

37:29.706 --> 37:35.671
♪ They are weak but he is strong ♪

37:37.005 --> 37:42.636

♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪

37:54.606 --> 37:59.361
♪ The Bible tells me so ♪

38:05.284 --> 38:09.454
Whenever I hear people say
that Christians are hypocrites,

38:09.538 --> 38:11.707
I kind of go, "Man, every
time we get together

38:11.790 --> 38:14.126
we're confessing
that we're hypocrites."

38:16.795 --> 38:18.714
The need of God and
the need of each other,

38:23.635 --> 38:25.220
it's all the pretending
to be perfect

38:25.304 --> 38:30.642
that breeds
inauthenticity in the church.

38:30.726 --> 38:34.187
Because none of us are.

38:36.565 --> 38:41.069
I've been wrestling lately
with-with surrender myself.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.326
But He loves us still.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.006
I think I need
to go to Nashville.

39:05.761 --> 39:10.432
Whether I go
or whether I don't go,

39:10.515 --> 39:12.392
I kind of think
it doesn't matter.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.773
Because in the end
all that really matters,

39:22.027 --> 39:27.449
♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪

39:27.532 --> 39:32.037
♪ Yes, Jesus
loves me ♪

39:33.663 --> 39:38.794
♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪

39:38.877 --> 39:43.799

39:46.968 --> 39:50.097
Nashville is so
not ready for him.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.473
I know.

39:53.683 --> 39:56.311
Hey!

39:56.395 --> 39:59.272
You weren't going to go without
saying goodbye to me, were you?

40:03.735 --> 40:04.945
Miss me.

40:05.028 --> 40:08.073
Yeah.
Of course I will.

40:08.156 --> 40:09.825
You're the one that
got me into this mess,

40:09.908 --> 40:11.410
this whole
Nashville thing.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.541
You just don't want
to go without Jess, so...

40:17.624 --> 40:19.668
quit being
a chicken, right?

40:24.714 --> 40:26.842
Just don't forget
about us, okay?

40:32.222 --> 40:33.140
<i>Richard!</i>

40:34.641 --> 40:37.185
Hey. I got to go
but don't forget

40:37.269 --> 40:38.395
who your real
friends are.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.064
<i>I'll miss you.</i>

40:43.900 --> 40:45.235
Time to go.

40:49.489 --> 40:50.490
You Okay?

40:54.453 --> 40:57.372
She's right.

40:57.456 --> 41:00.625
I am
so scared.

41:00.709 --> 41:04.963
It'll be okay.  We're
only five hours away.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.715
I'm doing what He
wants me to do.

41:06.798 --> 41:10.051
You'd think this would
be easier or something.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.137
If you're really
so scared about going,

41:12.220 --> 41:13.329
why don't you
move this junk

41:13.330 --> 41:15.250
and I'll ride with you
to the edge of town.

41:15.257 --> 41:16.600
Let me get my wallet.

41:20.479 --> 41:21.563
<i>Hey. hey!</i>

41:22.814 --> 41:25.066
<i>Hey, uh...</i>

41:25.150 --> 41:28.153
I think you packed
up some of my shirts.

41:31.031 --> 41:32.991
<i>Leaving Cincinnati
for Nashville</i>

41:33.074 --> 41:36.077
<i>was one of the hardest
things I've ever done.</i>

41:36.161 --> 41:42.042
<i>I felt like I was trading
one life for another.</i>

41:42.125 --> 41:43.877
<i>But I couldn't shake
the feeling</i>

41:43.960 --> 41:45.212
<i>that God wanted me
there for some reason.</i>

41:54.888 --> 41:58.183
<i>It was a whirlwind

41:58.225 --> 42:00.435
<i>Sing Your Praise to the Lord

42:00.519 --> 42:02.437
<i>and her album became

<i>in Christian radio
at the time so</i>

42:04.689 --> 42:07.859
<i>so of course they wanted
me to write more songs.</i>

42:07.943 --> 42:09.736
<i>As much as I
enjoyed writing music,</i>

42:09.737 --> 42:16.201
<i>I felt more and more that

42:16.284 --> 42:20.372

<i>I'm not sure I fit</i>

42:21.699 --> 42:24.793
<i>the aesthetic of
contemporary Christian music.</i>

42:24.876 --> 42:27.128
<i>Besides, songwriting and
royalties gave me something</i>

42:27.212 --> 42:30.882
<i>I'd never had before,

42:30.966 --> 42:32.717
<i>Not that I entirely knew

42:38.223 --> 42:40.308
<i>All the money in Nashville

42:40.392 --> 42:42.811

43:25.937 --> 43:27.439
Got into another fight
with Matt and Bryan.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.608
Another one, huh?

43:29.649 --> 43:31.443
This one was messy.

43:31.484 --> 43:33.987
You sure don't like to
play by the rules, do you?

43:34.070 --> 43:36.781
Amy, I don't even know
what the rules are.

43:36.823 --> 43:39.200
I've been here for a while now,
I've been writing for a while,

43:39.284 --> 43:41.661
don't get me wrong,
I like writing for you and...

43:41.745 --> 43:44.706
I like writing
for people but...

43:44.789 --> 43:46.374
I want to record
my own stuff.

43:46.458 --> 43:48.460
And they won't
even hear me out.

43:48.501 --> 43:50.019
So why don't they?

43:50.020 --> 43:51.921
I mean, they're keeping
me out of the loop on this.

43:52.005 --> 43:55.342
They say my songs
are too dark or too...

43:55.425 --> 43:59.846
I don't know, not happy enough,
not cheery and cheesy, if you ask me.

43:59.929 --> 44:03.224
What were you playing
when I walked in?

44:03.308 --> 44:04.476
Did you like it?

44:04.559 --> 44:06.311
Yeah.
Did you really?

44:06.394 --> 44:08.521
Yeah.
Really really?

44:09.898 --> 44:12.984
I loved it.
What is it?

44:13.068 --> 44:15.904
It's a song I wrote
for my wedding.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.156
Can you play me
the rest of the song?

44:18.198 --> 44:20.241
Yeah.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.409
Sure.

44:21.493 --> 44:23.161

44:53.858 --> 44:56.027
I want that song.

44:56.111 --> 44:57.195
Sorry.

44:59.239 --> 45:02.033
That one's for the girl.

45:48.121 --> 45:52.417
You know, I'm being asked
by people all the time

45:52.500 --> 45:54.085
how do you feel
close to God.

45:54.127 --> 45:56.463
And I kind of go

45:56.546 --> 45:59.090
"You know what?
I don't really know that."

45:59.174 --> 46:02.927
When I think about the
lives of...of the great saints

46:03.011 --> 46:08.767
I don't necessarily think that
they always felt close to God.

46:08.808 --> 46:11.102
See, closeness to God,
it isn't about feelings.

46:11.144 --> 46:15.106
Closeness to God
is about obedience.

46:15.148 --> 46:18.818
But if we don't obey,
we don't even have a chance.

46:27.786 --> 46:29.287
What's up, bud?

46:29.329 --> 46:31.664
Hey, Rich.

46:31.748 --> 46:33.208
That was
a really good show.

46:33.291 --> 46:36.211
Thanks.
It was fun.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.963
Can I talk
to you for a second?

46:39.047 --> 46:40.632
Yeah.
Absolutely.

46:40.673 --> 46:41.966
<i>What's up?</i>

46:42.050 --> 46:43.468
No, it's just...
I just

46:43.551 --> 46:47.096
want to say thank you

46:47.180 --> 46:48.264
for what you
said in there.

46:48.348 --> 46:51.309
Yeah, you bet, man.

46:51.351 --> 46:53.645
What did I say exactly?

46:53.728 --> 46:54.979
You said a lot.

46:55.063 --> 46:56.481
' -1

46:56.564 --> 46:59.359
- I'm not feeling close to God.
- Hm.

46:59.442 --> 47:04.531
It's just that I struggle
a lot with loneliness.

47:04.614 --> 47:06.366
I'm going to fill you
in on a little secret

47:06.449 --> 47:07.909
<i>that they won't tell
you in Sunday School.</i>

47:07.992 --> 47:09.410
<i>All the heroes
in the Bible,</i>

47:09.494 --> 47:12.372
all the weirdos
in the Bible,

47:12.455 --> 47:14.541
they all struggled
with the same stuff.

47:14.624 --> 47:17.544
Loneliness and all of it.

47:17.627 --> 47:22.507
It's just that some of us
aren't afraid to admit it.

47:25.009 --> 47:27.053
You know?

47:27.136 --> 47:28.888
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:28.972 --> 47:31.224
It's my dad.
I've got to go.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.518
<i>I won't forget.
Thanks, Rich.</i>

47:33.560 --> 47:35.520
You bet, man.
Nice to meet you.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.188
<i>Good night.
Good night.</i>

47:42.861 --> 47:44.404
<i>Every small conversation</i>

47:44.487 --> 47:46.447
<i>or fleeting moment
of connection</i>

47:46.531 --> 47:49.117
<i>reminded me that despite
all the flaws and tackiness</i>

47:49.200 --> 47:50.952
<i>of the Christian
music industry,</i>

47:51.035 --> 47:53.246
<i>God had given me
something to say</i>

47:53.329 --> 47:55.456
<i>and a platform
to share it.</i>

47:55.540 --> 48:00.545
<i>I realized that music could
be more than just music.</i>

48:00.628 --> 48:03.798
<i>But they didn't let me start
just making records over night.</i>

48:03.882 --> 48:06.092
<i>It took some convincing.</i>

48:06.175 --> 48:07.530
<i>Did you read the letter?</i>

48:07.536 --> 48:09.980
<i>- I haven't had time.
- Matt, this is important.</i>

48:09.988 --> 48:11.806
Can you at least tell
me you'll read it today?

48:11.890 --> 48:14.225
Just tell me,
what is it?

48:14.309 --> 48:16.477
I want to talk to you about
me recording my own songs.

48:16.661 --> 48:19.004
Rich, you know I think
you're an amazing writer,

48:19.005 --> 48:21.357
but I don't think you're
ready to be a recording artist.

48:21.441 --> 48:24.235
Sorry, we'll just talk
about this later, okay?

48:24.319 --> 48:26.154
What?
When I'm ready, Matt?

48:26.237 --> 48:27.739
What's with you, Rich?

48:27.822 --> 48:29.270
Do you really want
to do this here?

48:29.274 --> 48:31.284
- In front of Amy...
- I have the right to know!

48:31.367 --> 48:33.244
Look, you really want
to be a recording artist?

48:33.328 --> 48:34.728
Then everything's
got to change.

48:34.729 --> 48:36.623
Your look,
the way you dress,

48:36.706 --> 48:39.334
- it's your stage presence...
- What about my songs?

48:39.417 --> 48:41.127
I don't think
they're ready either.

my heart to say goodbye

50:11.592 --> 50:13.428
He seems ready to me.

50:18.641 --> 50:20.560
<i>Eventually, the label
gave me a shot</i>

50:20.643 --> 50:23.271
<i>and they signed me
to a pretty modest contract</i>

50:23.354 --> 50:25.356
<i>After a few months,
I finished my first album</i>

50:25.440 --> 50:28.568
called, well,
Rich Mullins.

50:30.737 --> 50:32.238
<i>After that,
I went on tour with Amy</i>

50:32.321 --> 50:33.823
<i>and opened
at her concerts.</i>

50:37.160 --> 50:39.037
<i>I found
that being on the road</i>

50:39.120 --> 50:41.539
<i>was much more enjoyable
than being in the studio.</i>

50:41.622 --> 50:44.959
<i>Maybe it's because I didn't like
Nashville very much, I don't know.</i>

50:45.043 --> 50:47.712
<i>Music was always something
that was a part of me,</i>

50:47.754 --> 50:49.170
<i>something I needed to share.</i>

50:49.173 --> 50:52.383
<i>Now I was reaching so many
people every night, it was exciting,</i>

50:52.467 --> 50:56.178
<i>despite all the corporate
politics that went with it.</i>

50:56.179 --> 50:59.490
<i>But it's funny how you can meet
hundreds of new people every day.</i>

50:59.491 --> 51:01.025
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

51:01.026 --> 51:03.478
<i>And still feel
almost completely alone.</i>

51:03.561 --> 51:05.313
<i>Thank you all
so much.</i>

51:05.396 --> 51:07.023
<i>We're going to take
a real quick break now</i>

51:07.106 --> 51:08.399
<i>and be right back
in a few minutes.</i>

51:18.659 --> 51:20.495
There he is!

51:20.578 --> 51:22.112
Tell us!
Here's our rock star!

51:22.113 --> 51:24.270
She does that so way
better than you, man.

51:24.273 --> 51:26.000
Yeah, she's
really talented.

51:26.084 --> 51:27.585
How are you feeling?

51:27.668 --> 51:29.087
Ah. Okay, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

51:29.170 --> 51:31.172
Who's smoking?

51:31.255 --> 51:35.802
- Hey.
- Ohhh. So proud of you.

51:37.970 --> 51:40.098
- Wayne.
- Hey,Dad.

51:40.181 --> 51:41.790
You look like a girl
with that long hair.

51:41.791 --> 51:43.101
You need a hair cut, boy.

51:46.104 --> 51:49.315
You haven't seen me in months
and that's what you have to say?

51:49.398 --> 51:50.775
It's only a joke.

51:50.817 --> 51:52.527
Don't be
so damn sensitive.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.378
I guess piano players
can wear their hair

51:54.462 --> 51:56.688
however they want
these days.

51:56.689 --> 51:59.467
Rich, would you mind coming back on
at the end and doing the rain thing?

51:59.468 --> 52:00.567
Absolutely.

52:00.568 --> 52:02.703
You've got
a very talented son here.

52:02.787 --> 52:04.372
You must be
a very proud father.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.124
No, I'm proud
of all my kids.

52:06.165 --> 52:07.375
Two boys,
two girls,

52:07.458 --> 52:09.544
and a...piano player.

52:11.129 --> 52:12.130
I got to go.

52:23.558 --> 52:26.227
What we're going to do,

52:26.310 --> 52:28.178
we're going to make rain, okay?

52:28.179 --> 52:30.523
So what I'm going to do is break
you guys up into three groups.

52:32.066 --> 52:33.317
This one's about here.

52:35.403 --> 52:36.654
<i>Nice.</i>

53:30.208 --> 53:31.876
Come on,
pick up.

53:33.753 --> 53:35.254
<i>Hello?</i>

53:35.338 --> 53:36.797
Jess!

53:36.881 --> 53:38.549
<i>Oh.
It's me.</i>

53:38.591 --> 53:40.468
<i>Hey, Richard.
Sorry I didn't make it.</i>

53:40.551 --> 53:44.222
Oh, no,
that's fine.

53:44.305 --> 53:46.140
Hey, listen, what are you
doing next weekend?

53:46.224 --> 53:47.642
The tour is coming
through Cincinnati...

53:47.725 --> 53:49.060
<i>Rich, I'm engaged.</i>

53:51.062 --> 53:52.370
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

53:52.372 --> 53:56.150
<i>I just, I don't know,
I just...</i>

53:56.234 --> 53:57.610
<i>I thought
you should know.</i>

54:20.174 --> 54:25.763
<i>You know,
I'm not a real...</i>

54:25.846 --> 54:28.599
<i>I don't know...</i>

54:28.641 --> 54:32.979
<i>I have no interest
in anybody else.</i>

54:33.062 --> 54:36.816
<i>The woman I'm in love with
is married to someone else so...</i>

54:36.899 --> 54:39.443
<i>that's the way it...</i>

54:39.527 --> 54:41.779
<i>that's the way it goes,</i>

54:41.821 --> 54:42.822
<i>and I don't mind that.</i>

54:46.158 --> 54:49.954
I think maybe God
wanted me to be celibate.

54:50.037 --> 54:53.082
The way he accomplished
that was to break my heart.

54:54.750 --> 54:56.502
So the song
you wrote for your wedding,

54:56.585 --> 55:02.008
<i>Doubly Good,
you gave to Amy Grant. Why?</i>

55:02.091 --> 55:05.288
Some things you just have
to walk away from, you know.

55:05.504 --> 55:08.830
And some things
you don't have a choice.

55:08.831 --> 55:12.743
The woman I love is married to
somebody else. That's the way it goes.

55:14.603 --> 55:16.480
Well, if that's the case,
then it seems to me

55:16.564 --> 55:19.150
that song
is exceptionally cruel.

55:19.191 --> 55:21.068
<i>Why is that?</i>

55:21.152 --> 55:24.255
Well, because it implies
that if God hasn't given you

55:24.338 --> 55:26.240
a love that's tender
and someone who's true

55:26.324 --> 55:29.827
<i>then he hasn't been
doubly good to you.</i>

55:29.869 --> 55:32.830
Well, God doesn't have to be
singly good to any of us.

55:32.872 --> 55:35.666
<i>We all have it better
than we deserve so...</i>

55:35.708 --> 55:37.835
<i>we should be thankful
for what we have.</i>

58:04.148 --> 58:05.524
It's good.

58:05.608 --> 58:06.817
<i>That's horrible.</i>

58:06.859 --> 58:08.819
I like it.
Bryan?

58:08.903 --> 58:10.404
<i>Maybe if we
just changed...</i>

58:10.488 --> 58:11.697
No, I don't want to...

58:11.780 --> 58:13.157
I don't want to change...

58:13.199 --> 58:15.826
I don't want
to do it at all.

58:15.910 --> 58:19.163
Okay this song is... it's exactly this that
made me not want to come to Nashville.

58:19.246 --> 58:22.249
Yeah, you made
that clear, Mullins.

58:22.333 --> 58:24.710
But no one's holding
a gun to your head here.

58:24.793 --> 58:26.003
We're just trying to help.

58:26.045 --> 58:28.547
Well, you're not helping.

58:28.631 --> 58:30.670
Look, my songs aren't
fill-in-the-blanks, you guys.

58:30.675 --> 58:33.844
You can't just put the word "Jesus" in a
few more times and expect it to be better.

58:33.928 --> 58:36.680
Rich, you already have a
lot of longing and brokenness

58:36.722 --> 58:38.390
in your other songs,
which is good.

58:38.474 --> 58:40.726
Maybe if you
just had happier lyrics.

58:40.809 --> 58:43.229
I'm not trying to be
a Christian pop star, guys.

58:43.312 --> 58:46.106
I'm just trying to say something true.
Okay?

58:46.190 --> 58:48.526
I don't want to
change my music.

58:48.609 --> 58:52.571
Yeah?
Well, things change.

58:52.655 --> 58:56.116
You sure don't seem
to mind a new car,

58:56.200 --> 58:58.285
a new house, right?

58:58.369 --> 58:59.910
Don't mess with my songs.

58:59.912 --> 59:02.540
Rich, we don't want to mess
with your songs, okay?

59:02.623 --> 59:05.125
But in order for people
to hear your music,

59:05.209 --> 59:06.590
we have to sell records.

59:06.594 --> 59:08.587
And in order
to sell records,

59:08.671 --> 59:10.430
- we have to get the sound right.
- Yeah!

59:10.431 --> 59:12.550
The problem is the sound.
The problem is me.  I got it.

59:12.633 --> 59:14.426
I get it.

59:14.510 --> 59:16.887
What are you doing?

59:16.929 --> 59:18.989
You can't leave, we're in
the middle of a session!

59:18.990 --> 59:21.520
<i>You don't want to hear anything
I have to say to you right now.</i>

59:24.687 --> 59:27.940
He's never going
to sing this song.

59:28.023 --> 59:29.775
Well, if he
doesn't sing this one,

59:29.858 --> 59:31.485
he's going to have to come
up with something else.

59:31.569 --> 59:33.404
We still got
one more slot to fill.

59:39.827 --> 59:43.589
You know, he has more talent
than anyone I've ever seen.

59:46.375 --> 59:49.920
What if he never gets
off the ground?

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:10.515
Hello?

01:00:10.516 --> 01:00:11.398
<i>Hey, Rich.</i>

01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:12.611
Hey, Gary.
What's up, man?

01:00:12.686 --> 01:00:15.210
<i>I know you're slammed,
but I got a friend</i>

01:00:15.213 --> 01:00:16.467
<i>who's asking for a favor.</i>

01:00:16.481 --> 01:00:18.138
<i>Would you have
time to do a show?</i>

01:00:18.183 --> 01:00:20.365
Man, I don't know.  We're
kind of behind on this thing.

01:00:20.368 --> 01:00:21.869
The labels all over me about it.

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:24.821
<i>- It's on a Native American reservation.
- Really?</i>

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:28.000
<i>Yeah, but it's all
the way out in Arizona.</i>

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:31.462
<i>It's, like, you know, a
million miles from Nashville.</i>

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:34.882
<i>I know you're super busy
working on the new album.</i>

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.383
<i>Yeah, I'll do it.</i>

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:48.896
<i>Truth was I couldn't
get away fast enough.</i>

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.898
<i>I probably would have done
a retreat on the moon</i>

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:54.318
<i>if it meant getting space
from the record company.</i>

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.111
<i>The only thing I knew
about the reservation</i>

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:57.629
<i>was that it
was called Window Rock</i>

01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:59.657
<i>and it was in the
middle of nowhere.</i>

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.034
<i>I really had no idea
what to expect.</i>

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:13.337
<i>Driving through
the reservation</i>

01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:15.506
<i>was like being
in another world.</i>

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:20.177
<i>It was beautiful there,
but sad at the same time.</i>

01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:25.516
<i>Children played
in rundown streets.</i>

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:27.351
<i>Some people barely left
their homes at all.</i>

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.528
<i>There's need here.</i>

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:41.865
<i>Great need.</i>

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.788
<i>I ended up staying
a few days here</i>

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:51.291
<i>working with
the Youth Ministry team.</i>

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:54.378
<i>I was able to get to know some
of the kids and hear their stories.</i>

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.879
<i>The good and the bad.</i>

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:02.720
<i>It was one of the most
real experiences in my life.</i>

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.555
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:09.143
<i>Lights out
in ten minutes.</i>

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:13.439
Hey, Rich.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:14.815
How's it going, man?

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.400
I really like
your shirt.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.902
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, I love this one.

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:20.279
You know what?

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:22.281
It looks like
it'd fit you.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.741
Thanks.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.033
Yeah, man.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.954
Here you go.
It's yours.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.749
Hey.
Can I talk to you?

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:34.126
Yeah. Sure. Sit.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.850
<i>I could tell
as soon as we sat down</i>

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:39.365
<i>that this kid had something
he needed to share.</i>

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:41.366
<i>We got to talking
and he told me</i>

01:02:41.367 --> 01:02:46.180
<i>about how six months earlier
he had shot himself in the stomach.</i>

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.475
<i>We talked late into the night
about depression and despair</i>

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:51.477
<i>and how he thought he
had nothing to hope for,</i>

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.606
<i>until he got so desperate
he tried to kill himself.</i>

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:59.401
<i>And then the humiliation
of failing even at that.</i>

01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:02.713
<i>I tried my hardest to find the
words, to be of some comfort to him</i>

01:03:02.796 --> 01:03:05.699
<i>to let him know
he wasn't alone.</i>

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:09.036
<i>Eventually I was able
to write them down.</i>

Yes, it's something new I've
been kind of playing around with

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:18.749
but so far
no lyrics.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.334
I like it.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.169
Yeah, it's cool.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.755
This is what I like
about being on the road, man.

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:28.300
I mean, for all the things I hate,
this is what I love.

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:29.843
Having you here,
on the open road,

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:31.678
look at the sky,

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:32.679
I mean, it's just...

01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:34.348
Awesome.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.295
Morning, Rich.

01:06:05.379 --> 01:06:07.214
Bryan.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.815
How was the retreat?

01:06:08.816 --> 01:06:10.349
<i>Don't start.  I said
I was going to go.</i>

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:11.289
What am I
supposed to do?

01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:13.470
Rich, don't walk
away from me.

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.180
Rich!

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.099
That's what you said
about that one retreat.

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:19.643
But every other week
it's something else.

01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:21.186
A retreat,
a camp,

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.063
a small church
in Michigan...

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.148
You're a recording
artist now, Rich,

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:27.317
- you don't have take time to...
- What do you want me to do?

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.861
I want you in my office,
that's what I want.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:32.531
<i>Sit down.</i>

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.032
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

01:06:34.116 --> 01:06:35.600
Yeah, you're good.

01:06:35.609 --> 01:06:37.995
Well, you're not as
good as you think, Rich.

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:40.305
<i>All this talking you've been
doing at your concerts,</i>

01:06:40.388 --> 01:06:42.833
that's got to stop!
Okay?

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.961
People are paying to hear
you sing, not to hear you talk.

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:46.950
<i>You understand that?</i>

01:06:46.954 --> 01:06:48.097
<i>No, no. No.</i>

01:06:48.122 --> 01:06:50.590
You're there to
make fans, not enemies.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.259
What can I say?
That's what happens

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.136
when you're honest
with religious people.

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:56.263
Well, those religious people
are paying your bills

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.849
and they're not going to keep
buying your records if you keep...

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.392
<i>Pissing them off?</i>

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:03.687
Are we done?

01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:06.898
No.

01:07:06.982 --> 01:07:09.901
<i>Look, we've got
a record to put out</i>

01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:11.361
and the last one
still isn't selling.

01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:13.363
Do you...?

01:07:13.405 --> 01:07:16.074
You understand
that, right?

01:07:16.158 --> 01:07:17.409
I thought
it was selling.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.202
Not as much
as we'd hoped.

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:21.204
What do you
want me to do?

01:07:21.288 --> 01:07:24.624
Your contract is
up after this, Rich.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:27.711
If your records
don't start selling,

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.379
it's over.

01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:31.339
You think I give
a damn about that?

01:07:36.178 --> 01:07:38.221
No, I don't.

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:45.395
It's disrespectful.

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:47.814
It's disrespectful to me,

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:49.232
this label,

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:51.568
<i>more importantly, Rich,</i>

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.320
<i>it's disrespectful to God</i>

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:54.738
who gave you
all of this ability

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:58.075
and all
of this opportunity.

01:07:58.158 --> 01:08:02.662
You think you're so
righteous, huh?

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:06.166
Now you try to throw
everything away

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:08.001
because you have
some idea about holiness.

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:10.087
<i>But you want to
know what I think?</i>

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:11.838
Oh, yeah, you keep
laughing, you keep laughing.

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:14.424
You know what I think?
I think you're scared.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:21.932
Time's running
out, Rich.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.225
God might wait for you,
but this label won't.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.567
And don't ever disrespect
me like that again.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.295
What do you want from me?

01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:21.366
<i>What's that?</i>

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:42.845
Rich Mullins
is mowing our lawn.

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:44.346
Oh.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:50.770
Honey?

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.522
Yeah?

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:55.400
Why is Rich Mullins
mowing our lawn?

01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:02.699
To say
he's sorry.

I know.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.463
I knew
you were special.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:02.008
Hurry UP!

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:03.317
I don't even care

01:11:03.318 --> 01:11:04.678
I just want to hang
out with you guys.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.846
See this?

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.056
Uh-huh.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:09.057
It's really nice, man.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.684
How's Morris?

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:13.420
Oh. Well, you should
live in Wichita, brother.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:14.237
He's retired now.

01:11:14.238 --> 01:11:16.364
He can hang out with him
as much as he want.

01:11:16.365 --> 01:11:18.358
- That'd be awesome.
- Yeah.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.653
Are you doing okay?

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:24.364
No.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:25.991
<i>What's up?</i>

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:29.327
<i>I've been drinking a lot.</i>

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:31.621
I hate myself for it.
I really do.

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:33.707
Don't do that.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.125
The drinking?

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:37.377
No, the hating.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.463
You know what?   You should
probably figure out the drinking, too.

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.165
Yeah.

01:11:42.249 --> 01:11:45.335
You guys!  He's on more than one
radio station at the same time!

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:47.379
You guys,
seriously hurry up!

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.348
Dude, I can't believe you
kept this in a desk for so long.

01:11:51.842 --> 01:11:53.643
You could've had
this hit big a year ago.

01:11:53.685 --> 01:11:55.395
Don't get me wrong,
I'm excited.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:58.815
I just don't think
I can handle this.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:01.818
We got a long
road ahead of us.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.320
Let's go!

01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:05.488
<i>We're here, guys.</i>

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:07.657
<i>I wonder if you'll have
a big crowd tonight.</i>

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.289
I think yes.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:15.749
What?

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.334
Don't blow it.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:21.254
<i>Ohhh, you guys-'</i>

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.013
- Ow!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.124
You people cannot be back
here without a ticket.

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:34.942
No, no,
I'm Rich.

01:12:34.943 --> 01:12:36.652
I don't care how much money
you got.  Buy a ticket.

01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:38.021
No, he's the singer!

01:12:38.063 --> 01:12:39.397
Oh! Oh!

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:41.858
- No problem! Go ahead, go ahead.
- Thanks, man.

01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:44.160
Hey, just so you
know it, you hurt me.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:46.287
Why don't you
just man up?

01:12:46.322 --> 01:12:48.281
No, my feelings.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:02.379
Welcome to being famous.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.900
Hi, I'm Rich Mullins.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.403
Now let's get this
over with.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.574
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:34.411
♪ He reigns from heaven above ♪

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:38.331
♪ With wisdom,
power, and love ♪

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:41.251
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:44.838
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.425
♪ He reigns from heaven above ♪

01:13:48.508 --> 01:13:51.962
♪ With wisdom, power, and love ♪

01:13:52.045 --> 01:13:56.808
♪ Our God is an awesome God ♪

01:13:56.891 --> 01:14:00.103
You know,
I've come to think

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:03.606
that to identify
fully with Christ,

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:07.193
who I claim to be
my Saviour and my Lord,

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:13.283
that to fully identify with Him
is to identify with the poor.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:16.870
Christianity is not about finding an
absolutely secure niche in the world

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.038
where you can live
with your perfect little wife

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:21.374
and your perfect little kids
in your beautiful little house

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:26.004
where there are no gays
or minority groups around.

01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:31.634
Christianity is about learning
how to love like Jesus

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:33.887
and Jesus loved the poor
and Jesus loved the broken.

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:40.310
<i>I knew that not everyone
appreciated what I had to say.</i>

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:43.146
<i>But I didn't really care.</i>

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:45.231
<i>Awesome God
became the number one song</i>

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:48.318
<i>in Christian radio the
week it released in 1988</i>

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:50.820
<i>or so they told me.</i>

01:14:50.904 --> 01:14:52.405
<i>So the concert
venues got bigger,</i>

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:54.741
<i>the crowds got louder,</i>

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:58.036
<i>Matt and Bryan were
a little bit nicer to me.</i>

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:59.160
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

01:14:59.163 --> 01:15:01.748
<i>I mean, the fame,
the money, the attention,</i>

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.750
<i>it just didn't
mean much to me.</i>

01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:08.880
<i>In fact, I got sick
of it pretty fast.</i>

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:35.240
<i>Life on the road
had taken its toll on me.</i>

01:15:35.323 --> 01:15:38.952
<i>One thing became
painfully obvious.</i>

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.578
<i>I needed a change.</i>

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.046
Look, here
he comes, hey, hey.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:52.966
- Yeah!
- There he is! Man of the hour!

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.385
Yeah, I bet you thought this
day would never come, huh?

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:57.637
Hoped it would
never come, actually.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.155
<i>We got some great news.</i>

01:15:59.156 --> 01:16:01.474
We got you booked solid
for the next six months.

01:16:01.558 --> 01:16:03.643
No more little church gigs
or youth camps.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:05.770
And you're no longer
an opening act, Rich.

01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:07.897
From now on, this town's going
to be begging to open for you.

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:10.315
Not only that. You can finally
afford a proper tour bus.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.859
Yeah, you're
ready, Rich.

01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:14.112
Everything is changed.
Yeah.

01:16:16.406 --> 01:16:17.907
I'm moving to Wichita.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.078
Yeah, okay, Rich.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.997
No, I'm serious.
I'm moving to Wichita.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:30.378
But you're finally on top.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.089
If you leave now,
you risk losing everything.

01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:37.677
I don't know if I'm concerned
about it either way.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.180
Look, I've seen you.
I know you like those new toys.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:44.434
I just saw you on that new
motorcycle, right?  Huh?

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:47.520
Rich, come on.

01:16:47.604 --> 01:16:49.272
You know
what the problem is?

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:52.859
I hadn't seen myself
on that new motorcycle.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.777
Here, you guys
can have it.

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:56.070
I don't even want it.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.073
Rich!

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:09.125
You know what a person is
that doesn't want anything

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:11.961
and doesn't fear anybody?

01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:15.131
What?

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:16.966
Dangerous.

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:27.644
Rich?

01:17:27.685 --> 01:17:28.645
Can I help you?

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:31.189
Um, I'm Justin.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:34.150
Holy cow! Good to see
you, man!

01:17:34.192 --> 01:17:35.652
It's been a while.

01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:37.528
You remember me?
Yeah, absolutely.

01:17:37.612 --> 01:17:39.405
- I hope you don't mind I got...
- No, not at all.

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:41.115
You kind of picked
the worst possible time.

01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:42.659
I'm literally just getting
ready to leave

01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:44.160
but if you need
a place to crash

01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:45.870
you know, it's yours.

01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:47.330
Where are you going?

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:49.666
I'm moving
to Wichita, actually.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:51.417
Oh.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:53.378
What are you doing
in Nashville anyway?

01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:56.547
Looking for a job.

01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.591
I'll tell you what, if you want a crappy
job, you can come join the band.

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:00.300
Really?

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.095
Yeah.
Sure, why not?

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.013
- You're just going to let me join the band?
- Yeah!

01:18:04.055 --> 01:18:05.765
- Awesome.
- Come in.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.350
Let's get this crappy job started.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:08.768
Here, take that
to the jeep, will you?

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:14.857
<i>It turns out Justin
is just as broken as I was</i>

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:17.860
<i>when he landed
on my doorstep.</i>

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:20.196
<i>That was one of the many
things we had in common.</i>

01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:23.449
<i>Along with enjoying
Aaron Copeland and road trips</i>

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:25.118
<i>broken relationships
with our fathers,</i>

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.120
<i>and greasy truck stop food,</i>

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:29.122
<i>stale motel lobby coffee,</i>

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:31.374
<i>it goes on and on.</i>

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.543
<i>And more than anything,</i>

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.294
<i>if was just nice to have
a friend on the road.</i>

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.296
So what?  You want
to be like Saint Frank?

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:41.926
It's not about being like
Saint Francis necessarily,

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:43.386
it's about following Jesus,

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:44.804
it's about being
like Christ.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.390
I mean,
how do you do that?

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:48.891
I'm not good
at being perfect.

01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:51.894
But it's
not about being perfect.

01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:53.980
Look at Saint Francis.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:55.815
He took vows.
He took a vow of chastity,

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.109
he took a vow of poverty,

01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.736
a vow of obedience.

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:01.738
I think that's what
we're really missing.

01:19:01.821 --> 01:19:05.825
That's what I want to do.

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:07.493
I think
I want to start living

01:19:07.577 --> 01:19:09.412
on whatever
the average American salary is.

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:12.248
Whatever the average
American worker makes.

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:14.083
Says the man
making millions.

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:16.252
Who cares?

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.963
Money destroys
people, man.

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:20.965
Money doesn't have
to destroy people.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.344
Well, it's destroying me.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.022
<i>You moved
to Wichita, Kansas</i>

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:39.108
<i>to go back to college
at Friends University</i>

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:41.027
<i>and do I have this right</i>

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.321
<i>that you went to get
a music education degree?</i>

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:45.114
No, I mean, yeah.

01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:46.949
It's true that I went
to get a music degree.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:49.118
<i>I wanted
to be able to teach kids</i>

01:19:49.202 --> 01:19:51.621
<i>but the real reason I went
back to Wichita was Morris.</i>

01:19:57.543 --> 01:20:03.341
<i>I thought maybe being around him
would make me walk a little straighter.</i>

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.176
<i>To be honest, it's
the closest thing to home</i>

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.928
I've found
in a long, long time.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:30.535
What' up, man?
I'm Rich.

01:20:30.618 --> 01:20:32.203
Hey, I'm Mitch.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:33.329
<i>Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.</i>

01:20:33.371 --> 01:20:34.831
Nice guitar.

01:20:34.914 --> 01:20:36.582
Yeah.
Thanks.

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:37.667
I'm just starting out.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.335
Sweet.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:41.379
This is James
Bryan Smith's class, right?

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:43.506
Yeah.  What, you
weren't here last week?

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:45.341
No, no, I was bummed.
I had to miss it.

01:20:45.383 --> 01:20:47.718
I was actually in Ireland.

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:51.180
And Ireland's incredible so I wasn't
really that bummed to be honest but...

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:54.559
<i>Yeah. You're seeing
friends, family?</i>

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:57.854
Actually I was shooting
a music video.

01:20:57.937 --> 01:20:59.960
It's not as cool
as it seems.

01:20:59.964 --> 01:21:00.973
Hey, everyone.

01:21:00.974 --> 01:21:03.006
Glad to see you all made
it back to class.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:07.113
Can I help you?

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:10.366
- This is Intro to Religion, right?
- Yes.

01:21:10.408 --> 01:21:12.410
What's your name?
Do you have a student ID?

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:14.036
Uh, my name
is Rich Mullins.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.873
I'm not sure
about the student ID.

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:18.374
The Rich Mullins?

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:19.959
<i>Awesome God guy.</i>

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.961
I do have other songs.

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:24.463
All right, and you're
taking this class?

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.215
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:27.716
Why?

01:21:27.717 --> 01:21:29.844
Actually, I was hoping you
would tell me that part.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.721
Okay, sorry.

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:33.539
Glad to have you, Rich.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:38.352
Everyone, take out your copies of G.K.
Chesterton's Orthodoxy.

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:57.413
Good morning.

01:21:57.455 --> 01:21:59.916
Yes, it is.
Barely.

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:03.753
I think this is the earliest
I've seen you, man.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.338
Good job.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:08.007
That's funny.
Justin up?

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.926
<i>Well, I haven't seen him
down by the coffee pot</i>

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:13.137
<i>so chances are
he's not up yet.</i>

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.931
Sam called.
Oh, yeah?

01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:16.974
<i>Said hi, yeah.</i>

01:22:17.058 --> 01:22:19.602
Does he, uh, got the beard
going these days?

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:21.270
Uh, no.
He's on a diet.

01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:28.402
So you call
your dad yet?

01:22:33.366 --> 01:22:37.536
Why should I, Morris?

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:42.124
I don't know the history
between you guys...

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:45.127
but if you're blessed enough
to have a dad to call,

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:47.505
<i>you should call him.</i>

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:51.634
You've been more of a father to me
these last three months.

01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:53.386
Yeah, but I'm
not your dad.

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:56.222
I am your friend.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.724
And as your friend,
I'm telling you...

01:22:58.808 --> 01:22:59.809
<i>Call your dad.</i>

01:23:29.005 --> 01:23:30.339
Morris, you okay?

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:33.092
<i>Morris!</i>

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:34.626
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, Morris!

01:23:34.627 --> 01:23:37.221
Morris!  Hey, talk to me,
buddy.  Talk to me.

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.515
Morris!

01:23:39.557 --> 01:23:41.017
Mo...Help!

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.393
Morris! Hey, hey,
come on, come on.

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.103
Justin!
Doris!

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:46.731
Call an ambulance!

01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:49.817
Oh, my God.
Don't leave me.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.695
Don't leave me.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:54.947
Don't leave me.

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:56.198
Morris!

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.200
Don't leave me!

01:23:58.284 --> 01:24:00.619
Help!
Help_

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.002
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:51.462
Everything's fine.
I'm sorry.

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:52.922
Everything's fine.

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:55.508
Everything's fine,
I'm sorry.

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:57.927
<i>Everything's fine.
Rich'?</i>

01:24:57.968 --> 01:25:00.362
Sam!
Are you drunk?

01:25:00.546 --> 01:25:06.143
Shhh.
I don't want anyone to know.

01:25:06.227 --> 01:25:09.188
Everyone knows.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:10.314
Can I talk to you outside?

01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:24.411
Look, man...

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.500
you got to understand.
People in my family

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:31.085
don't come
to these things sober.

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:40.719
Sam, I'm sorry.

01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:42.054
He was like
a father to me.

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:49.895
<i>He wasn't your dad.</i>

01:25:57.945 --> 01:25:59.029
He was mine.

01:26:36.025 --> 01:26:38.194
You're not going
to hit me, are you?

01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:43.199
No.

01:26:43.282 --> 01:26:44.283
<i>Well...</i>

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:46.619
probably not.

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:49.914
But if I would,
you would deserve it.

01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:52.708
Yeah, I would.
I do.

01:26:55.878 --> 01:26:58.714
Now what?

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:01.300
I was thinking
the same thing.

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:06.889
You sticking
around Wichita?

01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:12.645
You know I left Nashville
to be with your dad.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:15.314
Okay, Richard.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.066
<i>So now what are
you going to do?</i>

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:20.903
I don't know.

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.446
What would you
tell somebody

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:24.073
in your exact situation?

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:25.908
And I know you know
the answer to this.

01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:27.534
If I was talking
to somebody else,

01:27:27.618 --> 01:27:29.203
I'd give them
the Sunday School answer.

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:30.663
And what
is wrong with that?

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:33.666
My dad was a...

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:36.460
My dad was
a Sunday School teacher

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:38.254
for 20 years.

01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:40.756
If there's one thing
that I learned from him,

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:43.008
I learned that sometimes
the Sunday School answers

01:27:43.092 --> 01:27:45.844
are exactly
the right ones.

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:46.971
<i>So what is it?</i>

01:27:50.266 --> 01:27:52.455
That God loves you even
when you don't feel it but...

01:27:52.456 --> 01:27:53.556
Exactly.

01:27:54.395 --> 01:27:55.771
Exactly.

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:57.856
But the truth is
I don't get it.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.442
Even when I'm supposed to
know it, I just don't feel it.

01:28:00.484 --> 01:28:04.363
So, what do you know?
What do you feel?

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:09.201
I feel broken.

01:28:09.285 --> 01:28:12.496
The only thing that
makes me feel... good

01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:14.999
is... not pretending otherwise.

01:28:15.082 --> 01:28:18.711
Well, I think
that's a good place to start.

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:27.219
You know we're going
to be okay, right?

01:28:27.303 --> 01:28:28.804
We're going to be okay.

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:34.560
I hope so.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:04.214
<i>Losing Morris
was devastating.</i>

01:29:04.298 --> 01:29:06.008
<i>And left me
at another crossroads</i>

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:08.761
<i>in my life.</i>

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:10.712
<i>I came to Wichita
to find myself,</i>

01:29:10.713 --> 01:29:15.768
<i>only to leave feeling
just as lost as I had before.</i>

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.437
<i>I set out on the road
again with Justin,</i>

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.897
<i>not really sure
where I was headed.</i>

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:30.574
Hey, Rich.

01:29:30.657 --> 01:29:32.034
Where were you?

01:29:32.076 --> 01:29:33.700
I was just getting some food.

01:29:33.703 --> 01:29:37.581
Don't go anywhere without telling
me where you're going.  Okay?

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:39.458
Okay.
Is everything all right?

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.209
- I was just...
- I don't need you to talk.

01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:44.213
Just, if you're going somewhere,
tell me where you're going.

01:29:44.296 --> 01:29:46.799
Okay?
Or take me with you.

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:48.717
- Okay, but...
- Damn it.

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:57.935
Hey, can I play you a tape?

01:29:58.018 --> 01:29:59.561
What is it?

01:29:59.645 --> 01:30:01.897
There's this preacher Brennan Manning.

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:04.942
You should know better than to
even ask me to listen to a preacher.

01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:06.777
Just give it ten minutes.

01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:18.080
<i>In the 33 years
since I was first ambushed</i>

01:30:18.122 --> 01:30:19.915
<i>by Jesus in a little chapel</i>

01:30:19.957 --> 01:30:22.835
<i>in the mountains
of western Pennsylvania,</i>

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:27.464
<i>and the literally thousands of
hours of prayer and meditation,</i>

01:30:27.548 --> 01:30:31.510
<i>silence, solitude
in those years,</i>

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:35.097
<i>I am now
utterly convinced</i>

01:30:35.139 --> 01:30:37.349
that on Judgment Day

01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:43.689
the Lord Jesus will ask one
question and only one question,

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.732
"Did you believe
that I loved you?

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:51.196
<i>"That I desired you?</i>

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:56.034
<i>"That I waited
for you day after day?</i>

01:30:56.118 --> 01:31:00.956
"That I longed to hear
the sound of your voice?"

01:31:00.998 --> 01:31:03.959
The real believers
will respond and say,

01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:06.295
"I believed in your love,

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:10.632
"and I tried to shape
my life as a response to it."

01:31:10.716 --> 01:31:14.094
<i>But many of us who are
so faithful in our ministry,</i>

01:31:14.178 --> 01:31:17.723
<i>our practice,
church going,</i>

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:19.308
<i>are going to answer</i>

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:22.519
"Well, frankly, no sir.

01:31:22.603 --> 01:31:25.856
"I never really believed it."

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:29.234
And there's the difference
between the real believers

01:31:29.318 --> 01:31:32.988
<i>and the nominal Christians that
abound in our churches across the land.</i>

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:36.033
<i>No one can measure
like a believer</i>

01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:39.244
<i>the depth and intensity
of God's love.</i>

01:31:39.328 --> 01:31:41.038
<i>But then again, no one
can measure like a believer</i>

01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:43.582
the effectiveness of
our gloom, our pessimism,

01:31:43.665 --> 01:31:47.252
our low self-esteem,
our self-hatred and despair

01:31:47.336 --> 01:31:50.339
that block God's way to us.

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.216
<i>Do you see now
why it's so important</i>

01:31:52.299 --> 01:31:55.761
<i>to lay hold of this basic
truth of our faith?</i>

01:31:55.844 --> 01:32:00.766
<i>Because you're only going to be
as big as your own concept of God.</i>

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:02.351
We make God in our own image

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:05.354
and he winds up being
as fussy and rude

01:32:05.395 --> 01:32:08.023
and narrow-minded and
judgmental and legalistic

01:32:08.065 --> 01:32:11.401
and unloving
and unforgiving as we are.

01:32:11.485 --> 01:32:15.197
<i>I've been in churches in
Bangor, Maine, Miami, Seattle,</i>

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.283
<i>San Diego, and Saint Louis,
and honest to God</i>

01:32:18.367 --> 01:32:22.746
if so many Christians
I meet is too small for me.

01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:24.915
Because he is
not the God of the Word.

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:28.418
He is not the God who is revealed
in and by Jesus Christ,

01:32:28.502 --> 01:32:31.964
who at this moment comes
to your seat and says,

01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:35.050
I have a word for you.

01:32:35.092 --> 01:32:37.719
<i>I know your whole life story.</i>

01:32:37.803 --> 01:32:39.545
<i>I know every
skeleton in your closet.</i>

01:32:39.546 --> 01:32:42.966
<i>I know every moment of sin
and shame and dishonesty</i>

01:32:43.049 --> 01:32:45.811
<i>and degraded love
that's darkened your past.</i>

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:49.940
<i>Right now, I know your shallow
faith, your feeble prayer life,</i>

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:52.776
<i>your inconsistent discipleship,</i>

01:32:52.859 --> 01:32:56.321
<i>and my word
to you is this.</i>

01:32:56.405 --> 01:32:59.575
I dare you to trust
that I love you,

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:03.912
just as you are.

01:33:03.954 --> 01:33:05.998
Not as you should be.

01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:11.461
Because none of us
are as we should be.

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:18.510
<i>Whoa, what's up?
Are you all right?</i>

01:33:20.262 --> 01:33:23.640
<i>Rich.</i>

01:33:23.724 --> 01:33:24.766
Rich?

01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:53.462
You know, Brennan,
I've been going to church

01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:57.382
since I was less
than a week old.

01:33:57.466 --> 01:34:01.511
I can count on one hand how many times
I've heard the simple proclamation

01:34:01.595 --> 01:34:04.973
of what the Gospel
is really about.

01:34:05.015 --> 01:34:08.310
There are very few things
I love more than beer.

01:34:08.352 --> 01:34:11.355
Hot fudge sundae
is one of them.

01:34:11.438 --> 01:34:14.149
<i>Beer, huh'?
Mm-hm.</i>

01:34:14.191 --> 01:34:16.818
Yeah, I'm a recovering
alcoholic.

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:20.405
<i>That's my six-month
sobriety chip from AA.</i>

01:34:20.489 --> 01:34:24.576
I've been on the wagon and off the
wagon more times than I can remember.

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:28.121
Definitely more times than my
whiskey-loving brain can remember.

01:34:30.207 --> 01:34:31.213
It's honest.

01:34:31.214 --> 01:34:33.939
You should try it some time.
It's refreshing.

01:34:33.974 --> 01:34:38.090
Brennan, I don't know
if I have any friends left.

01:34:38.173 --> 01:34:40.509
Right now do you
think you're free?

01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:44.096
What do you mean "free"?

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:46.682
A free man wouldn't
need to ask.

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:50.769
Mm.

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.691
I'm not free.

01:35:01.071 --> 01:35:03.115
I feel like a failure.

01:35:05.325 --> 01:35:07.494
I'm on stage
all the time,

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:10.747
expected to be
this voice of hope.

01:35:10.831 --> 01:35:13.458
People want me to
be perfect, but I'm not.

01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:15.210
Brennan,

01:35:16.712 --> 01:35:18.296
I'm always

01:35:21.133 --> 01:35:23.885
carrying around
this darkness.

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:26.304
We're all fighting
the same battle.

01:35:26.388 --> 01:35:28.014
You know,
I love what you said.

01:35:28.015 --> 01:35:30.892
You said that... you said that God
loves us for who we are,

01:35:30.976 --> 01:35:33.770
not for who we should be because
none of us are who we should be.

01:35:33.854 --> 01:35:36.898
Yeah, that's the heart of the
ragamuffin gospel right there.

01:35:38.692 --> 01:35:40.569
What's that?

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:44.322
Ragamuffins are the unsung
assembly of saved sinners.

01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.908
They're little
in their own sight,

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:49.578
and aware
of their brokenness

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:52.122
and powerlessness
before God.

01:35:55.584 --> 01:35:59.379
A ragamuffin knows he's only a
beggar at the door of God's mercy.

01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:02.716
Brennan,

01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:11.099
I'm a ragamuffin.

01:36:11.141 --> 01:36:13.185
Oh, I know.

01:36:13.268 --> 01:36:15.604
Me, too.

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:19.483
And, uh, as one
ragamuffin to another,

01:36:19.566 --> 01:36:22.778
would you judge me if I had
another hot fudge sundae?

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:30.827
This next song
is my contribution

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:34.956

01:38:31.615 --> 01:38:33.283
Thank you.

01:38:40.874 --> 01:38:45.170
You know, you guys are all
into that born-again thing,

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:47.422
which is fine.

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.176
We do need
to be born again.

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:53.845
Jesus said that to a
guy named Nicodemus.

01:38:56.389 --> 01:38:58.683
But you tell me I need
to be born again

01:39:00.602 --> 01:39:02.771
to enter the kingdom of God,
I can tell you that

01:39:02.812 --> 01:39:06.316
you need to sell everything you have
and give it to the poor.

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:08.944
'Cause Jesus said that
to one guy, too.

01:39:10.654 --> 01:39:13.365
Maybe that's why God
invented highlighters.

01:39:15.951 --> 01:39:20.121
So we can highlight what we like in
the Bible and just ignore the rest.

01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:25.460
I think that
when we do things to...

01:39:26.962 --> 01:39:29.339
that corrupt our lives,

01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:36.096
we're really just trying to
comfort some ache that we have.

01:39:38.139 --> 01:39:40.558
<i>And I think that
the Church exists</i>

01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:43.144
'cause we all kind of
need each other.

01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:44.771
And why are we all

01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:49.150
walking around church
wearing these masks,

01:39:50.485 --> 01:39:52.404
pretending to be perfect?

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:57.534
It's so exhausting.

01:39:59.953 --> 01:40:01.788
Why do we do it?

01:40:05.542 --> 01:40:08.586
And I think that our only hope
is the love of God.

01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:18.388

Much like having the
simplicity of a child,

01:48:13.729 --> 01:48:16.908
<i>and the poverty of a child, you
come before your Abba Father,</i>

01:48:16.991 --> 01:48:20.661

Hey, Bryan.</i>

Uh, listen, man. Uh, this just
came to me last night,

01:54:36.161 --> 01:54:37.621
but I have an idea
for the new record.

01:54:37.705 --> 01:54:40.875
I want to do
ten songs about Jesus.

01:54:40.916 --> 01:54:43.460
Just really simple,
stripped down.

01:54:43.544 --> 01:54:46.547
- I'm really excited about this.
- Sorry, Rich. Sorry to to cut you off.

01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:49.633

01:54:49.717 --> 01:54:50.541

01:54:50.542 --> 01:54:52.650
Well, I was actually really
excited to talk to you, Rich.

Yeah, I know.

01:55:11.405 --> 01:55:15.826
I've been trying to call and tell you
but you don't answer the phone.

01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:17.661
Rich, what's this
new record about?

01:55:17.745 --> 01:55:19.747
Why would they leave
without telling me?

01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:22.249
I don't know.  I don't think
it's a bad thing, Rich.

01:55:22.333 --> 01:55:25.794
They're just moving on.

01:55:25.878 --> 01:55:29.131
- Moving on?  What...
- Yeah, people do that.

01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:31.425
Yeah, I know
people do that.

01:55:31.508 --> 01:55:33.802
<i>Oh. do you?</i>

01:55:34.845 --> 01:55:35.930
Really?

01:55:38.223 --> 01:55:40.601
Yeah, Justin.
Wha-What's your problem?

01:55:40.684 --> 01:55:43.103
I-I don't have
a problem.

01:55:43.187 --> 01:55:46.106
<i>I'm sorry
if I'm bothering you.</i>

01:55:47.441 --> 01:55:49.526
I just came by
to tell you

01:55:51.028 --> 01:55:52.988
I'm getting married.

01:55:55.157 --> 01:55:58.827
Well, that's... that's not bad news.
That's good news, man.

01:56:00.245 --> 01:56:01.455
Gosh, I'm-I'm relieved.

01:56:01.497 --> 01:56:04.124
<i>Um...</i>

01:56:04.208 --> 01:56:07.711
No, that's awesome.  We could
use another girl in the tour.

01:56:07.795 --> 01:56:10.130
No, Rich.

01:56:10.172 --> 01:56:12.716
I'm leaving the tour.

01:56:15.844 --> 01:56:16.804
Why would you...

01:56:21.141 --> 01:56:22.851
Of course you are.

01:56:36.991 --> 01:56:38.492
Yeah?

01:56:38.575 --> 01:56:42.871
Rich?
Brennan.

01:56:42.955 --> 01:56:45.082
<i>Okay, ragamuffin.</i>

01:56:45.165 --> 01:56:48.043
On a scale of one to ten,
how hung over are you?

01:56:51.672 --> 01:56:53.590
Eleven.

01:56:56.218 --> 01:57:00.055
What do you say that you and
I go away on a retreat of sorts?

01:57:02.016 --> 01:57:04.351
Is today too soon?

01:57:07.688 --> 01:57:10.274
In Jesus' language,

01:57:10.357 --> 01:57:13.610
<i>the word that he taught the
disciples to pray with was Abba.</i>

01:57:13.694 --> 01:57:17.072
It means "daddy."

01:57:17.156 --> 01:57:19.867
It doesn't really work for me to
think of God as a father, Brennan.

01:57:21.035 --> 01:57:23.454
Me, either.

01:57:23.537 --> 01:57:27.041
But it's the essence of
the disciples' identity.

01:57:27.082 --> 01:57:29.752
<i>And praying Abba,
I belong to you.</i>

01:57:29.835 --> 01:57:31.837
It's like breathing.

01:57:33.797 --> 01:57:37.259
I'll be in the cabin behind us.
You'll be in this one.

01:57:37.342 --> 01:57:39.720
The first night's going
to be the hardest.

01:57:39.762 --> 01:57:42.473
What exactly are you
going to have me do?

01:57:42.556 --> 01:57:46.643
I want you to write a
letter from John to you.

01:57:46.727 --> 01:57:49.772
Brennan, my dad wasn't exactly the
kind of guy that showed a lot of emotion.

01:57:49.855 --> 01:57:52.900
I'm not sure
I can do that.

01:57:52.983 --> 01:57:56.153
I think you told me that you
knew you father loved you.

01:57:56.236 --> 01:57:58.322
But he never told you.

01:57:58.405 --> 01:58:00.741
Let him tell you.

01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:34.733
<i>Abba, Abba.</i>

01:58:37.277 --> 01:58:39.321
<i>Abba.</i>

01:58:39.404 --> 01:58:42.449
Please, let my brother
come to see your love.

01:58:56.213 --> 01:58:59.133
<i>Get your damn head
off the clouds, Wayne.</i>

01:59:02.052 --> 01:59:03.804
<i>What's wrong
with you, boy?</i>

01:59:05.973 --> 01:59:08.475
<i>You're going to break every
damn thing around here.</i>

01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:14.314
<i>Two boys,
two girls,</i>

01:59:14.398 --> 01:59:15.566
and you.

01:59:17.317 --> 01:59:19.444
<i>Look at me
when I'm talking.</i>

01:59:22.322 --> 01:59:24.658
<i>You understand?
Damn fool's things.</i>

01:59:24.741 --> 01:59:26.743
<i>Speak up.
What does it say?</i>

01:59:26.827 --> 01:59:28.912
<i>When I tell you to do
something, you do it well.</i>

01:59:28.996 --> 01:59:31.206
You understand me?

01:59:31.290 --> 01:59:33.584
<i>I just don't understand why
everything you touch ends up...</i>

01:59:53.937 --> 01:59:55.856
Don't be afraid, son.

02:00:15.125 --> 02:00:17.044
<i>Wayne.</i>

02:00:20.339 --> 02:00:22.758
Wayne, boy.

02:00:24.384 --> 02:00:26.803
You know I didn't mean it.

02:00:26.887 --> 02:00:31.391
Son, if I'm not tough on you,
you're never going to learn.

02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:34.937
Come on.

02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:36.897
You'll be all right?

02:00:39.107 --> 02:00:40.609
Come on.

02:01:04.299 --> 02:01:06.677
<i>It's time, ragamuffin.</i>

02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:14.476
"Dear Wayne,

02:01:14.559 --> 02:01:16.436
"it's a lot
like I told you.

02:01:16.478 --> 02:01:20.440
"Being poor ain't shameful
it's just inconvenient.

02:01:23.527 --> 02:01:25.445
"I valued you."

02:01:25.529 --> 02:01:28.282
<i>It's just that
I didn't know you.</i>

02:01:28.365 --> 02:01:30.784
<i>I didn't know how I was
supposed to be affectionate.</i>

02:01:30.826 --> 02:01:33.195
<i>I thought
that was soft.</i>

02:01:33.278 --> 02:01:37.874
<i>I can see the strength of steel, but I
couldn't see the power of tenderness,</i>

02:01:37.958 --> 02:01:42.296
<i>or the courage it takes to
hold tenderness up to a fire.</i>

02:01:42.337 --> 02:01:47.467
<i>Anyway, I can't even remember that you
walked funny and had scrawny shoulders.</i>

02:01:47.551 --> 02:01:49.177
<i>Did you?</i>

02:01:49.261 --> 02:01:51.305
<i>Who the hell cares?</i>

02:01:51.388 --> 02:01:53.473
<i>I'm here in the company
of several fathers</i>

02:01:53.515 --> 02:01:56.143
<i>who occasioned pain
in their sons.</i>

02:01:56.184 --> 02:01:58.312
<i>Abraham did it
to Isaac.</i>

02:01:58.395 --> 02:02:00.397
<i>David to Absalom.</i>

02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:04.651
<i>God Almighty himself even
did it to His boy, Jesus.</i>

02:02:04.693 --> 02:02:07.237
<i>If you love him,
you'll surely hurt him.</i>

02:02:07.321 --> 02:02:09.656
<i>It's just a fact
of life.</i>

02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:13.076
<i>Passion, pain...</i>

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:17.497
<i>doesn't have to wreck
your life unless you make it.</i>

02:02:17.539 --> 02:02:19.207
<i>That's your choice.</i>

02:02:19.291 --> 02:02:21.668
<i>Be brave
in your pain, son.</i>

02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:23.920
<i>I don't say that
because you're not.</i>

02:02:24.004 --> 02:02:26.506
<i>I'm proof that you
didn't run off from it.</i>

02:02:26.548 --> 02:02:28.508
<i>But keep brave.</i>

02:02:31.345 --> 02:02:34.890
"I once wrote you
on October 21st, 1955.

02:02:36.183 --> 02:02:37.642
"Richard made me a...

02:02:40.604 --> 02:02:41.855
"a very proud man."

02:02:44.358 --> 02:02:47.986
<i>I'm up here in this cloud of
witnesses and you can ask anything.</i>

02:02:49.696 --> 02:02:52.949
<i>I brag about you
all the time...</i>

02:02:53.033 --> 02:02:55.369
<i>until they're about
to kick me out.</i>

02:02:58.914 --> 02:03:00.791
<i>I love you, boy.</i>

02:03:01.917 --> 02:03:03.460
<i>Dad.</i>

02:03:13.637 --> 02:03:15.806
So, how do you feel,
little brother?

02:03:18.141 --> 02:03:19.893
Free.

02:03:22.396 --> 02:03:24.731
And what does
a free man do?

02:03:24.815 --> 02:03:27.651
I want to be
on the reservation.

02:03:27.734 --> 02:03:30.237
That's...that's where
I want to be.

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:31.905
I want to be
with those kids.

02:03:31.947 --> 02:03:33.990
Then go.

02:03:34.074 --> 02:03:37.077
I mean, you could do
a lot of good there.

02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:40.580
I think they'll do
more good for me.

02:03:44.459 --> 02:03:48.338
So, what's next,
Brennan?

02:03:48.422 --> 02:03:52.134
<i>Next, I want you to write a letter
from your abba father God to you.</i>

02:03:53.593 --> 02:03:55.011
That I don't need to do.

02:03:57.013 --> 02:03:58.765
Why?

02:04:00.183 --> 02:04:02.769
I know what
that one would say.

02:04:11.486 --> 02:04:13.488
It always
cracks me up and...

02:04:15.615 --> 02:04:17.200
When people try
to impress God

02:04:17.284 --> 02:04:19.828
because you don't have
to impress God.

02:04:21.788 --> 02:04:24.374
He's already
knocked out by you.

02:04:28.295 --> 02:04:30.630
And Picasso said something
once that I really liked.

02:04:30.672 --> 02:04:32.674
He said,

02:04:32.757 --> 02:04:36.303
he said that good taste is
the enemy of great art.

02:04:38.388 --> 02:04:41.391
And I think that's
really true because

02:04:41.475 --> 02:04:45.479
good taste has everything to do with
being cultured and being refined and...

02:04:47.647 --> 02:04:50.066
if art has to do with anything,
it has to do with being human.

02:04:50.150 --> 02:04:55.238
I remember, when I was a kid, I was
a typical depressed adolescent.

02:04:55.322 --> 02:04:58.158
People would always
come up to me and say,

02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.327
say, "Cheer up.
God loves you."

02:05:02.871 --> 02:05:05.707
And I'd say, "Big deal.
God loves everybody.

02:05:08.001 --> 02:05:10.253
"It don't make me special.

02:05:12.172 --> 02:05:14.925
<i>"It just proves that God
ain't got no taste."</i>

02:05:17.677 --> 02:05:19.846
And I don't think
that he does.

02:05:22.015 --> 02:05:23.892
And thank God.

02:05:28.939 --> 02:05:32.776
So, I think that
God takes the...

02:05:32.859 --> 02:05:35.529
He takes the messiness and
the ugliness in our lives,

02:05:35.612 --> 02:05:41.034
and he makes the most
beautiful art in the world out of it.

02:05:41.076 --> 02:05:45.205
If you're half as cultured and refined
as most Christians wish you were,

02:05:48.250 --> 02:05:50.794
He would be useless
to Christianity.

02:05:57.133 --> 02:05:59.803
But God
is a wild man.

02:06:04.891 --> 02:06:08.103
And I hope that someday you have
the chance to encounter Him.

02:06:13.567 --> 02:06:16.403
But if you do,

02:06:16.486 --> 02:06:19.864
let me warn you, because
you'd better hold on for dear life.

02:06:24.995 --> 02:06:27.914
Or let go for dear life
maybe is better.

And the Irish
have always

02:13:18.783 --> 02:13:21.536
sort of traditionally have been
afraid of going out to sea.

02:13:21.619 --> 02:13:23.146
People go to Ireland
and they come back

02:13:23.230 --> 02:13:26.153
and they have these really beautiful
big sweaters, real big bulky,

02:13:26.208 --> 02:13:28.569
and they've got all kinds of
stitches and stuff in them.

02:13:29.168 --> 02:13:32.088
Well, they started doing that because
each of those different stitches

02:13:32.171 --> 02:13:34.424
it's different charms
and prayers and stuff

02:13:34.507 --> 02:13:37.010
that they would weave into
their husband's sweaters.

02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:41.264
And, uh, so, you know, if it worked, then
their husbands would come back alive.

02:13:41.347 --> 02:13:43.933
And if it didn't, because
fish don't eat wool,

02:13:44.017 --> 02:13:47.854
they could tell who was who by
what sweater was on them.

02:13:54.110 --> 02:13:56.279
I just think that's
a charming story.

02:14:02.869 --> 02:14:06.789
It scares me when I talk to you guys and
you guys think so highly of Christian music,

02:14:06.873 --> 02:14:10.626
contemporary Christian music especially,
because I know a lot of us

02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:13.379
and we don't know jack
about anything.

02:14:16.466 --> 02:14:18.926
Not that I don't want you
to buy our records.

02:14:20.636 --> 02:14:23.389
Or come to our concerts,
I sure do.

02:14:23.431 --> 02:14:26.309
But you should come
for entertainment.

02:14:26.392 --> 02:14:29.812
If you really want spiritual
nourishment, you should go to church.

02:14:38.196 --> 02:14:40.948
Those people
care about you.

02:14:41.032 --> 02:14:43.242
You don't have
to buy a ticket.

02:14:49.499 --> 02:14:53.586
We are not saved
because we're good.

02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:55.755
We're good
because we're saved.

02:14:57.381 --> 02:15:00.093
And never forget
what Jesus did for you.

02:15:00.176 --> 02:15:04.222
Never take lightly
what it cost him.

02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:10.103
And never assume that if
it cost him his very life,

02:15:11.979 --> 02:15:14.232
that it will
cost you yours.

02:15:21.072 --> 02:15:24.784
And when you wash up
on that other shore,

02:15:24.867 --> 02:15:28.704
even though you've been disfigured
beyond any recognition,

02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:38.131
the angels are going to see you there
and they'll go, "What is this?"

02:15:40.299 --> 02:15:42.802
"We're not even sure if he's human."

02:15:44.637 --> 02:15:48.349
But Jesus will say,
"No, that's human.

02:15:48.432 --> 02:15:50.309
"I know that one."

02:15:50.393 --> 02:15:53.229
And they'll say, "Jesus,
how do you know that one?"

02:15:55.273 --> 02:15:57.650
And he will say, "Well, you
see that sweater he's got on?"

02:15:58.305 --> 02:16:04.339
