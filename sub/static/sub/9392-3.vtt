Good morning!

00:38.506 --> 00:40.672
Is what
normal families say.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.508
Lois, I'll take
my breakfast to go.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.009
I'm going fishing
with the fellas.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.644
Peter, I thought we
were going to have

00:45.646 --> 00:47.012
some family time
this weekend.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.547
You're going
fishing again?

00:48.549 --> 00:49.782
Yes, Lois. I love fishing.

00:49.784 --> 00:51.750
Remember, fishing was
my not-at-all-memorable job

00:51.752 --> 00:53.285
for two years?

00:53.287 --> 00:54.987
No.
You don't remember
my fishing boat?

00:54.989 --> 00:56.688
You don't remember
Santos and Pasqual?

00:56.690 --> 00:57.689
Not even a little.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.124
They were like
male Consuelas.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.427
It was a mistake making 'em
Portuguese, though.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.328
People don't even know
what a Portuguese is.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.797
(chairs creaking)

01:04.799 --> 01:07.599
That's what I thought
a Portuguese was.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.835
Me and my brain, huh?

01:09.837 --> 01:11.804
And we're just
getting started!

01:11.806 --> 01:14.807
(birds squeaking,
foghorn blowing)

01:14.809 --> 01:17.709
Boy, it's not like Quagmire
to be this late.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.512
Yeah.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.880
<i>Jeez, I've never tried</i>

01:21.882 --> 01:23.649
<i>to make conversation</i>
<i>with just Joe before.</i>

01:23.651 --> 01:25.350
<i>This is brutal.</i>

01:25.352 --> 01:27.319
<i>Come on, Joe,</i>
<i>you're losing him.</i>

01:27.321 --> 01:28.620
<i>Think of something.</i>

01:28.622 --> 01:29.988
<i>This was your shot.</i>

01:29.990 --> 01:32.858
Two thirds
of the planet is water.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.426
Yeah.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.795
<i>Two thirds</i>
<i>of the planet is water?</i>

01:36.797 --> 01:38.997
<i>This guy's okay.</i>

01:38.999 --> 01:40.666
All right, well, um,

01:40.668 --> 01:42.768
we should probably go find out
what's keeping Quagmire.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.036
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.971
And you know, Joe,
uh, I was thinking.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.507
Maybe one night we get
dinner, just the two of us.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.908
I would like that.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.446
(knocking)
PETER:
Hey, Quagmire?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.582
You in there?

01:57.650 --> 01:59.651
(gasps)
Holy crap!

01:59.653 --> 02:00.819
Oh, my God!

02:00.821 --> 02:03.689
He must have autoerotically
asphyxiated himself!

02:03.691 --> 02:05.991
Yeah, while he was
watching clown porn.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.493
Oh, yeah, baby.

02:07.495 --> 02:10.429
Oh yeah, baby!
You make me so horny!

02:10.431 --> 02:11.597
(bicycle horn blowing)

02:11.599 --> 02:13.699
Come on, help me get him down!

02:17.837 --> 02:19.271
Peter, he's still alive!

02:19.273 --> 02:21.173
We got to get him
to a hospital!

02:21.175 --> 02:23.609
All right, but let's just
clown porn first.this

02:23.611 --> 02:27.713
(calliope music playing)

02:31.017 --> 02:33.519
Oh, Peter, we came
as soon as we heard.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.753
How is he?

02:34.755 --> 02:36.455
He's in a coma, Lois.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.590
My God, what the hell happened?

02:38.592 --> 02:41.593
He hung himself during
autoerotic asphyxiation.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.662
Just goes to show anything
can be dangerous.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.430
Is his family here?

02:45.432 --> 02:47.666
His sister Brenda is coming
with her boyfriend, Jeff.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.501
Oh, my God, not that guy.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.869
Is she still with him?

02:50.871 --> 02:52.671
Isn't he the one
that beats her?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.339
Yeah, but she's
gotten a lot better.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.710
All right, on the way back,

02:58.712 --> 03:01.480
I get to pick the radio station,
because that was awful.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.849
I know, yeah, it
was, I'm sorry.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.851
Oh, God, I just...
I hope Glenn's okay.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.186
I'm so worried about him.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.654
Shut up and limp!

03:08.656 --> 03:10.389
We're in a handicapped spot,
you slut!

03:13.326 --> 03:14.693
Well, Miss Quagmire,

03:14.695 --> 03:16.528
your brother Glenn
is lucky to be alive.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.632
You know, we're all lucky to be
alive on such a beautiful day.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.602
In fact, nurse--
all surgeries are outside today.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.470
You know, when we were kids,

03:25.472 --> 03:27.973
our mother used to sing
a song when we were sad.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.608
Maybe that'll help now.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.677
Come on, Brenda,
a stupid nursery rhyme

03:31.679 --> 03:34.179
isn't going to wake him up,
especially the way you sing.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.681
(laughing)
Right, man?

03:35.683 --> 03:36.982

04:26.200 --> 04:28.033
Well, Jeff,
he is my brother.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.636
Why do you always got to remind
me I didn't finish high school?

04:30.638 --> 04:34.473
Well, listen, how about I make
us all some dinner, huh?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.607
Come here!

04:36.709 --> 04:37.943
(clattering)

04:37.945 --> 04:39.311

04:39.313 --> 04:40.846
If today
wasn't your birthday...

04:40.848 --> 04:42.681
Jeff! Please,
you're being...

04:42.683 --> 04:44.049
What?!
What am I being?!

04:44.051 --> 04:45.584
Crazy?!
Unemployed?!

04:45.586 --> 04:47.786
Why don't you call the cops
like you did on Christmas?!

04:47.788 --> 04:49.955
I-I-I didn't call them!
They were called!

04:49.957 --> 04:52.924
Oh, now you're calling me a liar
in front of this cat?!

04:52.926 --> 04:54.393
I got another cat.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.835
Aw, that yellow lab
looks like it's dying.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.304
Peter,
that's Gwyneth Paltrow.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.505
She's fine.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.006
Look, turn off the light.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.709
I just want to get to sleep and
put this ugly night behind us.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.345
All that unpleasantness
with Brenda and Jeff

05:13.347 --> 05:14.713
was more than I can handle.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.981
It's no big deal, Lois.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.783
We probably just caught
'em on an off night.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.686
JEFF: Where do you get
off calling me a deadbeat
in front of your brother?!

05:20.688 --> 05:23.088
BRENDA:
No, Jeff, a-a-all I said was
that you were in between jobs!

05:23.090 --> 05:24.956
JEFF:
Well, it wouldn't matter

05:24.958 --> 05:26.692
if you'd just pick up that
night shift at the prison!

05:26.694 --> 05:29.194
BRENDA:
But then I'll be working
a hundred hours a week.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.462
JEFF:
So what?!

05:30.464 --> 05:32.831
I need money for motor oil
and wallet chains!

05:32.833 --> 05:35.200
BRENDA:
Okay, I'll ask about it Monday.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.668
Can I put my nightgown
back on?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.438
JEFF:
No, I'm not done drawing!

05:41.174 --> 05:42.374
(doorbell rings)

05:46.112 --> 05:48.146
Hey, Peter.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.015
Geez, Quagmire,
you look terrible.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.517
Oh, I didn't get any sleep.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.785
Hi, Glenn.
How are you?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.253
Not great, Lois.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.756
I'm stuck in the middle of some
bad stuff with my sister.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.092
I know, it sounded like there
was quite a ruckus going on

06:00.094 --> 06:01.827
over there last night.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.662
That Jeff seems like
kind of a monster.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.931
Yeah, that guy's scary
as an Iraq Lobster.

I've tried talking to Brenda
about leaving him,

06:34.828 --> 06:36.661
but I haven't
gotten anywhere.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.830
I was actually hoping
you could talk to her, Lois.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.366
She might open up more to you,
you know, 'cause you're a woman.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.935
Me?
Yeah, would you mind
at least trying?

06:43.937 --> 06:46.505
Well, I guess she does
need someone to talk to.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.973
Well, let's hope
she's good at talking

06:47.975 --> 06:49.841
'cause we know she doesn't
listen so good.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.676
That... we know.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.515
You know, Brenda, I'm glad
we could get together.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.816
Me, too, Lois.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.651
It's nice to have a
girlfriend to chat with.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.919
Don't you have any
back home?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.155
Oh, no. Jeff would
never allow that.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.656
You know, that's kind of what

07:04.658 --> 07:06.458
I want to talk to you about,
Brenda.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.260
Do you mind
taking off your sunglasses?

07:10.696 --> 07:12.164
Oh, my God.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.132
No, i-it's really
not that bad.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.834
It only hurts when I see.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.502
You know, you don't have
to stay with a man

07:17.504 --> 07:18.804
who treats you that way.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.839
Oh, Jeff's sweet.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.675
You don't see how soft
and gentle he hits me
when we're alone.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.143
Do you hear yourself?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.812
He shouldn't be
hitting you at all.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.347
I don't think you understand
how serious a matter...

07:29.349 --> 07:30.782
Close your menu.
What?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.818
Close your menu, so they
know we're ready to order.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.252
I'll give you
another moment.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.454
Damn it.

07:35.456 --> 07:38.123
I'm sorry.
Oh, shoot.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.258
See, this is why Jeff
corrects me all the time.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.793
Corrects you?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.962
Brenda, he's not correcting you,
he's beating you!

07:43.964 --> 07:46.798
Well, I-I-I can see
why you'd think that

07:46.800 --> 07:48.333
'cause of the punches and all,

07:48.335 --> 07:51.036
but it's just that Jeff's been
so angry about immigrants.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.304
What?!

07:52.306 --> 07:54.439
It'll be better when
he gets back to work.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.508
Our relationship is just
complicated, that's all.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.810
No, Brenda,
it's not complicated.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.378
Trying to get
a straight answer

08:00.380 --> 08:02.781
out of a 23-year-old
girl is complicated.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.549
So, do you want
to go out some time?

08:04.551 --> 08:06.985
Out like, go out or hang out
or just do something?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.186
Like a date.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.654
Like a date ?
Or like a d?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.356
Both, I... I guess.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.291
Yeah, sure, maybe.
I don't know. Yes, no.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.126
Here's the first three
digits of my phone number.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.761
E-mail me.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.032
Joe, the guy's a menace.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.934
They've been with me
three days now,

08:22.936 --> 08:25.270
and all he does is beat her
day and night.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.805
And on top of that,
they say they don't need

08:26.807 --> 08:28.507
to be entertained,
but then they're always like,

08:28.509 --> 08:29.875
"Hey, so what're we doing?
What's next?"

08:29.877 --> 08:31.943
Hey, Joe, can't you...
can't you just arrest the guy?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.645
I can't arrest Jeff

08:33.647 --> 08:36.281
unless Brenda files a formal
complaint with the police.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.549
She won't go to the police.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.751
She's afraid
of what Jeff will do.

08:39.753 --> 08:40.952
And to be honest,
I don't blame her.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.754
I mean, w-w-what happens
if one of these nights,

08:42.756 --> 08:44.189
he hits her so hard
he kills her?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.690
Sorry, Quagmire.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.693
Police policy, we can't step
in until it's too late.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.029
But if I were you, I'd
set up an intervention.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.197
What's that?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.999
It's like a surprise
birthday party,

08:54.001 --> 08:56.835
but instead of cake and
presents, there's angry letters

08:56.837 --> 08:58.303
and someone who
inappropriately tries

08:58.305 --> 08:59.771
to make it about themselves.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.039
Aw, that sounds great!

09:01.041 --> 09:03.208
I bet I would really shine
at one of those.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.979
All right, well, first
we want to thank you all

09:07.981 --> 09:09.681
for being here for Brenda.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.516
Now, I know it's going
to be a long day,

09:11.518 --> 09:14.753
but we're all here because we
care about her very much.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.354
What the... what's going on?

09:16.356 --> 09:17.622
What's all this?

09:17.624 --> 09:19.524
Brenda, this is
an intervention.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.760
A lot of us don't like how
Jeff's been treating you.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.762
So we're going
to say a few things,

09:23.764 --> 09:26.131
and then you'll say a few
things, and then we'll be done.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.198
Sound good?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.833
Um.
I g.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.536
All right, so we're going to go
around the room and tell you

09:31.538 --> 09:33.872
exactly how your situation
has affected each of us.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.106
Meg?

09:35.108 --> 09:38.710
I feel like if he likes you,
maybe you can change him.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.178
Okay, maybe she wasn't
the one to start with.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.513
Caleb?

09:43.983 --> 09:46.484
Caleb, you want
to go ahead?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.119
M... M... me?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.154
Yeah, go ahead.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.523
Uh... It's Chris.

09:51.525 --> 09:52.958
Y-You don't know my name?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.926
All right, this isn't off
to a flying start.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.494
Peter, why don't you go ahead?

09:56.496 --> 09:58.797
So, you like
getting beaten, huh?

09:58.799 --> 10:00.799
Well, why don't you smoke a
whole carton of cigarettes!

10:00.801 --> 10:02.701
Look, I know what you guys
are trying to do,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.302
but Jeff and I are fine.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.705
No, Brenda,
you're not fine, okay?

10:06.707 --> 10:09.307
Please, I'd like to say
something, if I may.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.642
(clearing throat)

10:10.644 --> 10:14.546
"Brenda, the fact that
you are being abused

10:14.548 --> 10:17.282
"has affected my life
in the following ways:

10:17.284 --> 10:20.018
"The sister that I knew
and loved growing up

10:20.020 --> 10:22.654
"no longer exists.

10:22.656 --> 10:26.124
"The person I see before me now
is just a punching bag.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.260
"And I call you 'person'
and not 'woman'

10:29.262 --> 10:32.530
"because a woman is a strong,
beautiful, vibrant creature.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.699
"A woman embraces life.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.636
"A woman makes choices
to make her life better.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.773
"Sadly, the fact that you are
with Jeff, proves to me

10:41.775 --> 10:46.344
that you have made a choice
to make your life worse."

10:46.346 --> 10:49.047
I-I want the girl
I grew up with back.

10:49.049 --> 10:53.518
I want... I want my sister back.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.688
Brenda, I love you.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.690
Please make the right decision.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.759
Which is a perfect time
for me to tell my jokes.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.027
Peter!

11:02.029 --> 11:03.862
And I will save
them for the end.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.868
Glenn, I am so lucky

11:09.870 --> 11:13.905
to have such a wonderful,
loving brother like you.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.879
So, are you gonna
leave him?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.981
Oh, there you are!

11:22.983 --> 11:25.850
Hey, give me some money!
I saw a cool bandana.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.419
What the hell's going on here?!

11:27.421 --> 11:29.654
Listen here, you bully!
For your information,

11:29.656 --> 11:31.022
Brenda just agreed
to leave you!

11:31.024 --> 11:32.757
Like hell she did.

11:32.759 --> 11:33.825
Brenda, you tell 'em?

11:33.827 --> 11:35.093
No, not yet.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.862
Everyone...
I have wonderful news.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.432
Jeff and I are getting married.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.633
(all gasp)

11:41.635 --> 11:42.801
I'd show you the ring,

11:42.803 --> 11:44.602
but it's under the splint.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.304
My finger fell down the stairs.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.872
You're getting married?!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.841
Yeah, but only 'cause
she's pregnant.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.809
Pregnant?!

11:50.811 --> 11:53.211
Oh, congratulations!

11:53.213 --> 11:54.813
Have you thought
of any names yet?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.681
Maybe... maybe
"Slappy"?

11:56.683 --> 11:58.183
Or-or "Bruisey"?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.185
Or "Keep-It-Down-
In-There-sy"?

12:05.157 --> 12:07.358
Guys, what the hell
am I gonna do?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.359
She can't marry
that bastard.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.961
He's just gonna
keep beatin' her,

12:09.963 --> 12:11.863
and then he's gonna beat
the kid, too!

12:11.865 --> 12:14.265
God, I wish she'd never met
Jeffrey Fecalman.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.301
You know, I was
thinking... Wait, what?

12:16.303 --> 12:17.802
What?
That's his name?

12:17.804 --> 12:19.637
Yeah.
Huh-larious.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.306
But you know,
I was thinking this afternoon,

12:21.308 --> 12:23.775
what the hell happened to the
days when a guy does something

12:23.777 --> 12:27.145
like that to a girl, and a bunch
of us guys get together

12:27.147 --> 12:29.514
and just go kick
his (bleep) ass?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.616
Boy, that'd be
satisfying.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.651
Well... why not?

12:33.653 --> 12:34.853
What do you mean?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.187
The three of us.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.189
We go over there
and we do what's right;

12:38.191 --> 12:39.324
we kill the bastard.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.658
Whoa, whoa, Quagmire.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.128
You know, I could arrest
you just for saying that.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.462
You know what else
you can get arrested for?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.764
Soliciting a rooster.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.967
I don't know what this
cock-a-doodle-doo thing is,

12:48.969 --> 12:51.369
but it sounds gay
and it sounds scatological.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.804
I'm in.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.106
You're about to
have a neat day.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.342
Quagmire, you're talking
about murdering a guy.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.343
It doesn't matter

12:58.345 --> 13:00.311
what he's done,
it's still murder.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.380
No, Joe, it <i>does</i> matter
what he's done!

13:02.382 --> 13:04.482
These kinds of guys
don't change.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.818
Y-you think they ever suddenly
wake up and realize

13:06.820 --> 13:09.420
the error of their ways
and clean up their act? No!

13:09.422 --> 13:10.989
They just keep ruining
everyone's lives,

13:10.991 --> 13:12.924
and the world is better off
without 'em.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.259
It's against the
law, Quagmire,

13:14.261 --> 13:15.593
and that's the
end of it.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.496
(loud slap, Brenda screams)

13:18.498 --> 13:20.298
JEFF:
What the hell?!
Did you change the channel

13:20.300 --> 13:21.699
while I was going
to get a beer?!

13:21.701 --> 13:23.768
Oh, yeah, I-I'm sorry,
honey, I just wanted

13:23.770 --> 13:25.103
to see who was
on <i>Letterman.</i>

13:25.105 --> 13:26.704
We're watching <i>Leno,</i>
<i>you bitch!</i>

13:26.706 --> 13:28.006
I'm so sorry!

13:28.008 --> 13:30.375
His soft, gentle humor
connects effortlessly

13:30.377 --> 13:32.510
with my mainstream
sensibilities!

13:32.512 --> 13:33.878
(slaps)
(screams)

13:34.847 --> 13:36.781
Let's waste this dick.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.285
Boy, everything's different now
than it used to be, isn't it?

13:40.287 --> 13:42.954
You know, this morning I had
a bowl of Fruity Pebbles cereal.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.156
Yeah, yeah. When I was a kid,
they were boulders!

13:45.158 --> 13:48.159
(laughs loudly)

13:48.161 --> 13:49.460
(laughs)

13:49.462 --> 13:51.629
Cereals do change.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.164
Oh, no, no. Here's something,
here's something.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.332
Did you hear about this?

13:54.334 --> 13:55.867
Here's a bunch
of words in a row:

13:55.869 --> 13:57.302
because the economy's so bad,

13:57.304 --> 13:59.304
they've decided they're gonna
shut down all the prisons.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.672
Yeah, yeah.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.708
And-and they're gonna send
all the inmates to Congress.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.177
I don't get that one!

14:09.949 --> 14:11.482
Hi, there, Jeff.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.117
Hey, what's going
on, dudes?

14:13.119 --> 14:14.319
Brenda just fell.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.455
Get your lazy ass up and get
my neighbors some beers!

14:17.457 --> 14:19.457
Actually, we don't
have time, Jeff.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.259
We were just about
to go on

14:21.261 --> 14:22.927
our annual midnight
hunting trip.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.796
We thought you might
want to join us.

14:24.798 --> 14:26.030
Yeah, what the hell.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.700
Go shoot some animals,
that sounds like fun.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.536
Hey, it beats sitting at home
watching Meg pop her zits.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.677
(squish)

14:42.648 --> 14:44.816
Okay, okay,
who would you rather do?

14:44.818 --> 14:47.318
Dame Judi Dench with 30 minutes
of kissing first

14:47.320 --> 14:51.122
or Eddie Izzard in drag,
but he has a working vagina?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.157
Would Eddie Izzard tell
others about it?

14:53.159 --> 14:54.826
Eddie Izzard is very discreet.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.027
Then that's your answer.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.162
You know, Quagmire,
I gotta say,

14:58.164 --> 15:00.265
I was pretty surprised
you wanted me to come along.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.166
I thought
you hated my guts.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.434
(chuckles)
Oh, come on, Jeff,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.203
I don't hate your
(bleep) guts.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.471
Well, then what the hell
are we doing out here?

15:06.473 --> 15:08.273
I thought we were gonna kill...
Ah!

15:08.275 --> 15:11.342
So, Jeff, do you
like loud sentences?!

15:11.344 --> 15:12.343
I guess.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.312
I gotta take a whiz.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.147
All right, look,
when he comes back,

15:16.149 --> 15:17.682
I'm just gonna
do it, okay?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.784
I'm just gonna point my gun
straight at his head

15:19.786 --> 15:21.319
before he even knows
what's going on.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.320
(shotgun racks)

15:22.322 --> 15:23.821
Kinda like this?

15:23.823 --> 15:26.257
You know, Quagmire,
you are pathetic.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.493
You have to bring
your friends out here with you

15:28.495 --> 15:30.094
to do your dirty work?

15:30.096 --> 15:32.363
What... what do you mean, Jeff?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.332
You're gonna kill me,
is that it?

15:35.968 --> 15:38.169
Uh-uh!

15:38.171 --> 15:39.370
Not unless you want

15:39.372 --> 15:41.172
your friend's brains
all over the place!

15:41.174 --> 15:43.374
Listen, Jeff,
just put the gun down

15:43.376 --> 15:45.576
and we'll forget this whole
thing, okay?

15:47.646 --> 15:51.349
Oh. Well, that's never
happened before.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.851
Kinda don't know
what to do next.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.486
So now you'll forget
the whole thing?

15:55.488 --> 15:57.755
Yeah, I, uh, guess
that is what I said.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.357
No, no, we can't forget
the whole thing!

15:59.359 --> 16:00.825
Yeah, you know,
he's right.

16:00.827 --> 16:01.960
We can't forget it.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.861
Fine. Now here's
the plan:

16:03.863 --> 16:06.264
I'm taking Quagmire
for a little ride,

16:06.266 --> 16:09.500
and you guys are gonna stay out
here and freeze to death!

16:09.502 --> 16:11.669
Now, get those hands
where I can see 'em!

16:11.671 --> 16:14.038
All the way up!

16:14.040 --> 16:16.474
Oh, my shirt's a
little too short.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.709
That's okay.
You can keep 'em

16:17.711 --> 16:20.278
the way you had 'em
so it covers your stomach.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.680
Thank you. You know, if
<i>this</i> Jeff was around more,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.282
we wouldn't have
tried to kill you.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.616
See you later,
schmucks!

16:38.630 --> 16:40.665
All right,
this is far enough.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.378
Well, Quagmire, sorry
it had to end this way;

16:53.380 --> 16:55.446
a tragic hunting accident.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.349
I guess that little
baby's gonna grow up
without an uncle.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.617
Actually,
I have a brother.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.419
Gary Quagmire.
Oh.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.921
I think... I think
you got a brother,
too, don't you?

17:03.923 --> 17:05.256
All right, forget
the uncle thing!

17:05.258 --> 17:07.959
Get ready to die,
Quagmire.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.494
You know, if you had any balls,

17:09.496 --> 17:11.963
you'd put that gun down and we
could settle this like men.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.331
(laughs)

17:13.333 --> 17:16.667
That's awful big talk for a
scrawny bastard like you.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.002
Hey, I'm serious, man.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.871
Unless you're scared
I can take you.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.973
Suit yourself, man.

17:21.975 --> 17:24.776
Just means
you're gonna die slower.

17:42.461 --> 17:43.828
(spits)

17:47.332 --> 17:49.534
(bones crack)

17:51.336 --> 17:53.104
(gasping)

18:08.320 --> 18:09.654
(groans)

18:34.847 --> 18:36.380
(engine starts)

18:37.382 --> 18:38.850
(engine revs)

18:40.452 --> 18:42.386
What the hell?!
I killed you!

18:43.522 --> 18:46.524
I choke myself every day,
you bastard!

18:47.426 --> 18:49.160
(tires squeal)

18:59.304 --> 19:01.606
(radiator hissing)

19:15.988 --> 19:18.523
(sobbing)

19:19.758 --> 19:21.626
Oh, oh, Glenn,
there you are.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.929
Jeff didn't come home last night
and he hasn't called.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.631
Uh, well, actually,
about that, Brenda,

19:26.633 --> 19:28.633
he must've left
early this morning.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.202
Yeah, we found this
note he left you.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.305
"Dear Brenda,
I have decided to leave you.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.507
"I realized
that you are too good for me,

19:36.509 --> 19:38.843
"and you and our unborn child
would be better off

19:38.845 --> 19:41.345
"without me in the picture.
Love, Jeff.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.781
"P.S. If the cops ask, tell them

19:43.783 --> 19:46.651
"that Joe, Peter and Quagmire
were with you last night.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.352
"If you tell anyone otherwise,

19:48.354 --> 19:51.455
"I will come back and not only
hit you, but I will murder you.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.624
"And no one will care
because you're garbage.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.360
And your baby is going
to be a child of garbage."

19:56.362 --> 19:57.695
(hushed):
It's a little rough, Peter.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.263
I didn't write it. Joe did.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.498
I wanted it
to sound real.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.333
It's gotta sound
like he wrote it.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.468
Plus, she kinda is
garbage, Quagmire.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.837
"Well, I best be
rolling on now."

20:06.839 --> 20:08.940
(hushed):
Oh, come on!
Who says that?!

20:08.942 --> 20:10.107
(hushed):
It's an expression.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.142
Yeah, if you're in
a wheelchair.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.176
Listen, you had
your chance.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.544
I e-mailed it
to both of you.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.845
You wrote back:
"Looks fine."

20:14.847 --> 20:16.948
And you just added that
part about Grape Ape.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.717
"P.P.S. I really love Grape Ape.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.785
The end."

20:20.787 --> 20:22.753
(sighs) Wow.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.989
I guess he's really gone.
