THE ACTUAL CEREMONY

00:12.583 --> 00:16.166

I AM SURE WILL BOTH
RAZZLE AND DAZZLE US

00:24.708 --> 00:28.000
FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.917
MISS POTTER, IT'S GO TIME.

00:39.708 --> 00:40.917
UH...

00:42.208 --> 00:47.708
MY SPEECH ISN'T QUITE
READY YET. UH...

00:47.708 --> 00:50.250
SO, I GUESS I DON'T
REALLY HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY RIGHT NOW. UM...

00:54.041 --> 00:55.792
THANK YOU.

00:55.792 --> 00:58.583
ALL RIGHT! YES!

01:04.875 --> 01:07.208
NO ONE SAYS A WORD.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.250
Peskin: ALL RIGHT,
A QUICK REMINDER
FOR THOSE OF YOU

01:09.250 --> 01:12.750
WHO MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE
TO DARK PAGAN DESIRES.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.500
IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING
PULLING A GRADUATION
NIGHT PRANK,

01:15.500 --> 01:19.875
THINK AGAIN,
I CAN ASSURE THAT
SECURITY WILL BE...

01:19.875 --> 01:22.708
TIGHTER THAN
RICKY MARTIN'S PANTS.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.208
WHAT?

01:27.250 --> 01:30.125
ALL RIGHT, SOME
HOUSEKEEPING DETAILS.

01:30.125 --> 01:35.458
UH, THE BLUE PARKING
PERMITS WILL NOT BE VALID
AT ALL ON SATURDAY.

01:35.458 --> 01:36.625
Mitch: HEY, PACE.

01:36.625 --> 01:38.125
LOOK, MR. LEARY,
I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT I'M LATE,

01:38.125 --> 01:39.208
BUT I'M STUCK
WITH THIS AMERICAN
HISTORY TEACHER

01:39.208 --> 01:40.500
THAT SEEMS TO THINK
THE FINAL BELL,

01:40.500 --> 01:43.250
THAT'S HER QUEUE
TO VOMIT UP A 10 MINUTE
DISSERTATION

01:43.250 --> 01:45.417
ON WHO WON THE COLD WAR,
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
WAS US. SO, GO U.S.A.

01:45.417 --> 01:49.917
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR
BEING LATE, PACEY.
I WISH IT WAS.

01:49.917 --> 01:51.959
THAT SOUNDS
VAGUELY OMINOUS.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

01:51.959 --> 01:53.959
IT'S ABOUT YOUR GRADES.

01:53.959 --> 01:56.458
AND WHAT ABOUT
MY GRADES?

01:56.458 --> 01:58.083
WELL, YOU'RE--
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT
ON THE BUBBLE

01:58.083 --> 01:59.458
OF BEING ABLE
TO GRADUATE.

01:59.458 --> 02:01.166
DON'T TELL ME
THAT, MAN.

02:01.166 --> 02:02.708
I HAVE SACRIFICED
MY ENTIRE SENIOR
YEAR FOR THIS, OK?

02:02.708 --> 02:04.000
I PULLED DOUBLE
CLASS LOADS, I HAVE
DONE EVERYTHING

02:04.000 --> 02:06.208
THAT YOU PEOPLE
ASKED ME TO DO.

02:06.208 --> 02:07.458
I KNOW YOU'VE
WORKED HARD. I DO.

02:07.458 --> 02:08.500
AND IT'S NOT OVER YET.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.959
OK, NOW, HOW WELL
YOU DO ON YOUR FINAL EXAM

02:11.959 --> 02:14.917
WILL DETERMINE
IF YOU CAN GRADUATE.

02:14.917 --> 02:19.834
PRINCIPAL PESKIN INSISTS
THAT, UH, YOU SPEND
YOUR TIME STUDYING

02:19.834 --> 02:22.959
RATHER THAN
ATTEND THE REHEARSAL.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.250
WHAT, SO YOU'RE
KICKING ME OUT?

02:27.458 --> 02:28.667
OK, PLEASE DON'T
DO THIS TO ME
HERE, MR. LEARY.

02:28.667 --> 02:33.000
I'M REALLY UNDER
A MICROSCOPE
RIGHT NOW.

02:33.000 --> 02:33.959
PLEASE.

02:33.959 --> 02:36.166
I'M SORRY, PACEY.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.792
BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOT
MY DECISION.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.000
YOU--YOU SHOULD
GO HOME NOW.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.834
FINE.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.333
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING
IN PARTICULAR, DOUGIE,

03:55.333 --> 03:58.792
OR DOES THIS JUST
FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY
OF GENERAL HARASSMENT?

03:58.792 --> 04:00.625
A MINUTE AGO,
I DROVE RIGHT BY YOU.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.708
NOW, EITHER YOU
WERE PURPOSELY
IGNORING ME,

04:03.708 --> 04:05.125
OR YOU JUST
DIDN'T SEE ME.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.792
NO, I WAS JUST INVOKING
THE HARD-EARNED LESSONS
OF MY YOUTH.

04:07.792 --> 04:12.792
"AVOID EYE CONTACT WITH
ANY AND ALL AUTHORITY
FIGURES AT ALL COSTS."

04:12.792 --> 04:15.041
EVEN THE EFFEMINATE ONES.

04:15.041 --> 04:17.208
PLEASE, GOD,
MAY THAT NEVER
GET OLD.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.500
SO, PACE,
HOW YOU DOING?
EVERYTHING OK?

04:20.500 --> 04:22.583
OH, YEAH, I'VE
NEVER BEEN BETTER, DOUGIE.

04:22.583 --> 04:23.708
HOW'S SCHOOL?

04:23.708 --> 04:25.667
WELL, APPARENTLY,
RIGHT NOW,

04:25.667 --> 04:27.250
MY GRADES
ARE ON THE THE BUBBLE.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.917
SO THE POWERS THAT BE
AT OUR BELOVED
CAPESIDE HIGH,

04:28.917 --> 04:31.083
THEY DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO GRADUATE OR NOT.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.375
I'M REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, PACE.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.542
SO, THERE YOU HAVE IT.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
RUN ALONG HOME

04:37.542 --> 04:38.583
AND TELL THE FOLKS
THAT LITTLE BROTHER

04:38.583 --> 04:41.083
IS LIVING DOWN
TO EXPECTATIONS.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.500
AND CANCEL THAT HUGE
GRADUATION PARTY

04:42.500 --> 04:45.000
I'M SURE THEY WERE
GONNA THROW IN MY HONOR.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.166
LISTEN, PACEY,
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
KNOW FOR SURE, HUH?

04:48.166 --> 04:49.208
IF I GRADUATE?

04:49.208 --> 04:50.375
YEAH.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.667
I HAVE ONE MORE
FINAL TO TAKE.

04:53.667 --> 04:56.750
BUT IT'S A BIG ONE.
IT'S MR. KASDAN'S
LIT COURSE,

04:56.750 --> 04:59.959
WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY
MY BEST SUBJECT.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.750
LISTEN, UH...

05:02.750 --> 05:03.458
I COULD HELP YOU STUDY.

05:06.417 --> 05:07.959
WELL, BOY,
I APPRECIATE THAT,

05:07.959 --> 05:09.708
BUT I'D REALLY
RATHER YOU DO SOMETHING

05:09.708 --> 05:11.792
BENEFICIAL TO ALL
MANKIND WITH YOUR TIME,

05:11.792 --> 05:13.708
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
SOLVE A MURDER.

05:13.708 --> 05:16.625
WAIT A SECOND, PACEY.
I'M SERIOUS HERE.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.708
YOU'RE SERIOUS?
I'M SERIOUS.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.291
EVERYBODY
IS SERIOUS.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.458
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND?

05:21.458 --> 05:23.041
WHY THEY WON'T JUST
LET ME GRADUATE,

05:23.041 --> 05:24.959
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME,
THE SOONER I GET OUT
OF THAT PLACE,

05:24.959 --> 05:26.542
THE BETTER OFF EVERYONE
INVOLVED WILL BE.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.375
DAWSON, THIS SPEECH
IS DRIVING ME NUTS.

05:31.375 --> 05:34.834
I--I MUST HAVE
SOME SORT OF A BLOCK
OR SOMETHING.

05:34.834 --> 05:39.166
I'LL GO YOU ONE BETTER.
I BET YOU THAT BLOCK
HAS A NAME.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.625
PACEY.

05:43.625 --> 05:44.959
YEAH, SO, HE HAS
BEEN KNOWN

05:44.959 --> 05:47.208
TO OCCUPY
MY THOUGHTS
ON OCCASION.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.542
AND SEEING HIM FORCED
TO LEAVE HIS OWN
GRADUATION REHEARSAL,

05:49.542 --> 05:51.792
THAT WAS PAINFUL.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.500
I JUST WANTED
TO GO UP TO HIM
AND SAY SOMETHING.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.875
WHAT STOPPED ME
WAS KNOWING

05:55.875 --> 05:57.458
THAT HE WOULD
RESENT ME FOR IT.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.208
YEAH, I WENT UP
TO HIM THE OTHER DAY
IN STUDY HALL

06:00.208 --> 06:01.959
AND ASKED IF HE
NEEDED SOME SORT OF HELP.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.291
HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR
HE DIDN'T WANT ANY.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.375
I MEAN, YOU'D THINK
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

06:05.375 --> 06:06.750
PACEY AND I COULD
STILL BE FRIENDS.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.166
IS THAT ASKING
TOO MUCH?

06:08.166 --> 06:10.667
WELL...

06:10.667 --> 06:12.708
IT IS ASKING TOO MUCH.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.834
SO, WHAT DO I DO?

06:17.834 --> 06:19.208
I MEAN,
HE NEEDS HELP.

06:19.208 --> 06:22.500
LOOK, THE 2 OF YOU WERE BOTH
IN THAT RELATIONSHIP,

06:22.500 --> 06:25.208
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY
STILL HAVE FEELINGS.

06:25.208 --> 06:27.417
THAT SAID, IT CAN'T
HURT TO LET HIM KNOW
THAT YOU CARE.

06:27.417 --> 06:30.208
WHO KNOWS?
IT MIGHT EVEN HELP YOU
WRITE YOUR SPEECH.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.959
COME ON.

06:33.959 --> 06:34.875
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

06:34.875 --> 06:36.792
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
DETAILING MY SPOKES

06:36.792 --> 06:38.834
IN A GALAXY FAR,
FAR AWAY.

06:41.291 --> 06:43.250
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

06:43.250 --> 06:44.792
YEAH.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.500
TALKING ABOUT THIS
MAY NOT BE THE WISEST
WAY TO GO,

06:46.500 --> 06:49.166
BUT NOBODY'S
EVER ACCUSED ME
OF BEING WISE.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.041
I'LL VOUCH FOR THAT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

06:52.041 --> 06:53.959
ABOUT US.

06:53.959 --> 06:55.375
WHAT WE ARE
TO EACH OTHER.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.041
AT LEAST,
WHAT I THINK WE ARE.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.583
[SIGHS]

06:58.583 --> 07:00.250
TOBY, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
HONEST WITH YOU

07:00.250 --> 07:02.667
ABOUT WHERE WE STAND.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.166
WELL, WE ARE DATING.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.250
AND IF THE USUAL
TERMINOLOGY APPLIES,

07:08.250 --> 07:11.041
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
YOUR...

07:12.041 --> 07:13.542
BOYFRIEND.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.000
YOU CAN'T SAY IT,
YET, CAN YOU?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.834
IN FACT, YOU GO
OUT OF YOUR WAY
NOT TO SAY IT.

07:19.834 --> 07:20.917
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE.

07:20.917 --> 07:21.917
LOOK, IF YOU
CAN'T SAY IT,

07:21.917 --> 07:23.041
HOW'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL?

07:23.041 --> 07:24.834
OK, OK. I'LL--
I'LL SAY IT.

07:24.834 --> 07:26.792
WHEN?

07:26.792 --> 07:28.625
WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE.

07:28.625 --> 07:31.792
OK. WHAT'S YOUR
DEFINITION
OF APPROPRIATE?

07:31.792 --> 07:34.291
WHEN THERE'S
NOBODY ELSE AROUND?

07:34.291 --> 07:36.417
AT SMALL,
INTIMATE GATHERINGS?

07:36.417 --> 07:37.500
UNDER OATH?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.125
JUST LET ME
SURPRISE YOU.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.041
LISTEN, YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET OFF WORK EARLY
TOMORROW OR NOT?

07:42.041 --> 07:43.458
YEAH.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.333
WHAT?

07:44.333 --> 07:46.458
WHAT IF SHE
DOESN'T LIKE ME?

07:46.458 --> 07:47.500
OH, PLEASE.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.417
COULD HAPPEN.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.083
DON'T MAKE ME
USE THIS.

07:52.250 --> 07:52.625
DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

IT'S ME DRUE.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.375
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:18.375 --> 08:19.792
LET ME IN.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.834
OH, NOT SO FAST, TEX.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.834
I DON'T REALLY
SEE THE WISDOM
OF LETTING YOU IN.

08:23.834 --> 08:27.291
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, SERENADE YOU
FIRST?

08:27.291 --> 08:28.834
YES, THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

08:28.834 --> 08:29.750

08:29.750 --> 08:30.875
WHY DON'T YOU
CRAWL BACK DOWN THERE

08:30.875 --> 08:32.833
AND GO FIND YOURSELF
A PROPER BACKING BAND,

08:32.833 --> 08:35.375

KNOW THAT?

INTO ONE OF OUR

SAID HE WASN'T
GOING TO MY GRADUATION.

I'M SORRY.

WAS FED UP

09:24.041 --> 09:26.333
WITH MY HISTORY
OF INEXCUSABLE BEHAVIOR.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.500
AND THEN I,
IN TURN, BLAMED HER

09:28.500 --> 09:31.708
FOR HER HISTORY OF BEING
A COLD-HEARTED BITCH.

09:31.708 --> 09:33.417

A PLACE TO CRASH.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.000
[CHUCKLES]

10:46.000 --> 10:48.291
BOY, I SURE
DESERVED THAT ONE.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.291
GOOD JOKE, MR. KASDAN.
STUPID OLD ME.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.000
PACEY, IT WAS JUST--
NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.500
I WAS AGREEING
WITH YOU.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.667
I MEAN, I GOT IT, RIGHT?

10:54.667 --> 10:57.625
IT WAS ABOUT ME
BEING STUPID?

10:57.625 --> 10:59.708
HOW I'M SOME LAME,
KNOW-NOTHING STUDENT

10:59.708 --> 11:01.959
WHO'S JUST SLOWING DOWN
EVERYONE AROUND ME?

11:01.959 --> 11:03.000
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY
KILLS ME ABOUT YOU PEOPLE?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.959
I SHOW UP TO CLASS
WITH A BROKEN PENCIL, OK?

11:05.959 --> 11:08.166
NOW, YOU ASSUME
THAT THAT MEANS
THAT I DON'T CARE,

11:08.166 --> 11:09.667
WHEN THE REALITY
OF THE MATTER IS,

11:09.667 --> 11:11.458
I'VE BEEN BUSTING MY ASS
IN YOUR CLASS

11:11.458 --> 11:12.834
FOR THE LAST 5 MONTHS,
JUST TO KEEP MY HEAD
ABOVE WATER,

11:12.834 --> 11:15.250
SO THAT I COULD
GRADUATE FROM THIS PLACE!

11:15.250 --> 11:17.750
SO, IF YOU ASK ME,
YOU'RE  THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T CARE.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.250
NONE OF THE TEACHERS
HERE CARE!

11:19.250 --> 11:20.333
I MEAN,
FOR THE HONOR STUDENTS,

11:20.333 --> 11:21.667
YOU'RE WILLING
TO BEND OVER BACKWARDS,

11:21.667 --> 11:23.625
BUT FOR ME, A STUDENT
WHO COULD ACTUALLY
USE THAT HELP,

11:23.625 --> 11:25.917
YOU CAN'T WAIT
TO GET RID OF ME!

11:25.917 --> 11:27.000
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH!

11:27.000 --> 11:28.500
LOOK, I HAVE TOLERATED
THIS OUTBURST OF YOURS

11:28.500 --> 11:32.834
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU NEED
TO PASS THIS TEST,
BUT YOU ARE THIS CLOSE

11:32.834 --> 11:33.917
TO THROWING AWAY
AN OPPORTUNITY,
YOUNG MAN!

11:40.583 --> 11:42.166
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT.

11:42.166 --> 11:46.250
I MUST BE AN IDIOT,
BECAUSE I CANNOT
FOR THE LIFE OF ME

11:46.250 --> 11:49.834
FIGURE OUT WHY
I TRY SO DAMN HARD FOR YOU.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.875
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I BOTHER AT ALL.

11:59.083 --> 11:59.917
[SLAM]

12:07.291 --> 12:08.500
HEY.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.208
HEY.

12:12.375 --> 12:13.708
GOT A MINUTE?

12:15.375 --> 12:18.083
YEAH, SURE.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.208
PACEY, I HEARD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

12:21.208 --> 12:22.542
IN MR. KASDAN'S
CLASS TODAY--

12:22.542 --> 12:25.417
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D PREFER TO KEEP
THAT TOPIC

12:25.417 --> 12:28.708
OFF THE DISCUSSION
LIST.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.041
WELL, COULD YOU
AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.417
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I'M NOT GOING TO DO,

12:32.417 --> 12:33.542
NAMELY, GRADUATE.

12:33.542 --> 12:35.959
LOOK, PACE, I'M SURE
THERE'S PROBABLY TIME TO--

12:35.959 --> 12:37.917
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.
I MEAN, YOU COULD--

12:37.917 --> 12:40.500
YOU COULD GO TO MITCH,
YOU COULD GO TO PESKIN,

12:40.500 --> 12:42.875
I MEAN, THERE'S GOT
TO BE SOMETHING
WE COULD DO.

12:42.875 --> 12:43.917
I'M SORRY, "WE"?

12:43.917 --> 12:45.291
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT WERE WERE

12:45.291 --> 12:47.625
INVOLVED IN A TEAM
SPORT HERE, JOEY.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.291
I DON'T THINK
THERE IS A "WE"
ANYMORE.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.166
LOOK...

12:53.166 --> 12:56.750
LOOK, PACE,
I KNOW IT'S OVER.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.792
I JUST WANT
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

13:01.041 --> 13:06.125
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE TRUTH IS, JOE?

13:06.125 --> 13:09.708
I STILL LOVE YOU,
AND I PROBABLY
WILL LOVE YOU

13:09.708 --> 13:11.875
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.959
BUT I CAN'T JUST
BE YOUR BUDDY.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.708
'CAUSE, AS MUCH
AS I ENJOY THE CONCEPT
OF BEING JUST FRIENDS,

13:21.708 --> 13:23.291
IN REALITY,
IT'S A BIZARRE
FORM OF TORTURE,

13:23.291 --> 13:26.083
AND I'M JUST NOT
WILLING TO PARTICIPATE
IN IT.

13:26.083 --> 13:29.041
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WHAT I WANT TO DO
IS JUST MOVE ON

13:29.041 --> 13:31.041
AND GET OVER YOU,
AND THE ONLY WAY
FOR ME TO DO THAT

13:31.041 --> 13:33.208
IS TO NOT BE
AROUND YOU ANYMORE.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.500
AND YOU CAN'T SEE
ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE

13:36.500 --> 13:37.834
WHEN YOU AND I COULD
BE FRIENDS?

13:37.834 --> 13:39.625
I DON'T WANT TO THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.125
I GUESS I SHOULD GO.

13:48.834 --> 13:50.583
LOOK, JOE, I KNOW THAT--

13:50.583 --> 13:53.834
I KNOW COMING OVER HERE
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
EASY FOR YOU.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.792
NOTHING SEEMS
EASY ANYMORE.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.500
HOW'S MY LITTLE
SPEECH WRITER?

14:21.500 --> 14:23.375
YOU MAKING ANY
PROGRESS?

14:23.375 --> 14:25.417
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M MAKING ANY PROGRESS?

14:25.417 --> 14:27.166
NO, NOT REALLY.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.417
I JUST WENT OVER
TO PACEY'S TO TRY
TO TALK TO HIM,

14:30.417 --> 14:32.750
AND, UH...

14:34.667 --> 14:35.625
IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.875
OH, THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

14:37.875 --> 14:40.542
HE'S SO MESSED UP,
AND HE WON'T LET
ANYBODY HELP HIM.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.542
NOT EVEN YOU?

14:42.542 --> 14:45.083
ESPECIALLY ME.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.125
THAT AND...

14:47.125 --> 14:50.708
HAVING TO WRITE
A SPEECH FROM HELL.

14:50.708 --> 14:53.166
ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHY
I CAME IN HERE.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.041
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.917
WHAT IS IT?

14:56.917 --> 14:59.291
IT'S A LETTER
FROM MOM TO YOU.

14:59.291 --> 15:02.542
UH, SHE WROTE IT
A FEW DAYS BEFORE
SHE PASSED AWAY,

15:02.542 --> 15:03.917
AND ASKED ME
TO HOLD ON TO IT,

15:03.917 --> 15:07.542
AND GIVE IT TO YOU
WHEN YOU GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.917
MY GOD.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.625
MAYBE THIS
WILL INSPIRE YOU.

15:13.417 --> 15:15.291
YOU GONNA OPEN IT?

15:16.333 --> 15:19.708
UH...YEAH, OF COURSE.

15:19.708 --> 15:20.917
I JUST...

15:24.750 --> 15:27.417
I DON'T REALLY FEEL
UP TO IT RIGHT NOW.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.375
I KNOW. TAKE ALL
THE TIME YOU NEED,

15:29.375 --> 15:31.583
AND I'LL
LEAVE YOU ALONE.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.208
Tobey: HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE 50 YARD DASH, MAN?

15:42.208 --> 15:43.583
WE'RE RIGHT ON TIME,
EARLY, EVEN.

15:43.583 --> 15:44.917
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND. I KNOW HER.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.834
SHE PROBABLY BOOKED
THIS FLIGHT 3 MONTHS
IN ADVANCE,

15:46.834 --> 15:47.750
SO SHE COULD GET
A SEAT BY THE EXIT

15:47.750 --> 15:49.291
AND BE THE FIRST ONE
OFF THE PLANE.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.166
AND YOU WOULD
KNOW THIS FOR SURE
BECAUSE...?

15:51.166 --> 15:53.041
BECAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS
THE FIRST ONE
OFF THE PLANE.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.542
THERE SHE IS,
THERE SHE IS.
ANDIE!

15:57.542 --> 16:00.291
JACK!

16:00.291 --> 16:03.667
HEY, JACK! OH!

16:03.667 --> 16:05.208
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW WAS THE FLIGHT?

16:05.208 --> 16:06.125
OH, TURBULENT,
CRAMPED AND STUFFY,

16:06.125 --> 16:08.917
BUT I AM WILLING
TO OVERLOOK THAT,

16:08.917 --> 16:10.792
ASSUMING WE GET
TO ATTEND AT LEAST ONE

16:10.792 --> 16:12.125
KICK-ASS
GRADUATION PARTY.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.792
OH, YEAH.
MY PEOPLE ARE ON IT.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.583
OH, I'M SORRY. I DON'T
BELIEVE WE'VE MET.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.792
YEAH, UH, ANDIE,
TOBY. TOBY, ANDIE.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.166
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:23.166 --> 16:23.542
HE'S TOLD ME
VOLUMES ABOUT YOU.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.500
OH.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.667
I'M SORRY, I DON'T
MEAN TO BE RUDE,

16:28.667 --> 16:30.083
BUT HOW DO YOU
KNOW JACK?

16:30.083 --> 16:32.166
UH, WELL, UH,
TOBY'S, UM...

16:34.542 --> 16:35.208
TOBY'S MY BOYFRIEND.

16:38.667 --> 16:42.000
OH--OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS GREAT! OH!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.959
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T E-MAIL ME,
YOU BIG SNEAK.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.458
I'M SORRY,
IT'S JUST KIND OF RECENT.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.291
SWEET JESUS.
GRAMS, CAN I JUST,

16:52.291 --> 16:54.208
UH, TALK TO YOU
FOR ONE SECOND?

17:00.542 --> 17:03.500
OK, WHAT'S GOING ON?
'CAUSE I SAID THAT HE
COULD SPEND ONE NIGHT

17:03.500 --> 17:05.875
BECAUSE I FELT
SORRY FOR HIM.
WHY IS HE STILL HERE?

17:05.875 --> 17:06.959
WELL, AFTER YOU
LEFT FOR SCHOOL
THIS MORNING,

17:06.959 --> 17:09.916
DRUE AND I
HAD A NICE CHAT.

17:09.916 --> 17:11.333
HE EXPLAINED
EVERYTHING.

17:11.333 --> 17:16.125
AWFUL SITUATION,
A FATHER ABANDONING
HIS FAMILY.

17:16.125 --> 17:19.000
ANYWAY, I--
I TOLD HIM HE WAS
MORE THAN WELCOME

17:19.000 --> 17:21.250
TO SPEND
ANOTHER NIGHT.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.875
FOR A PRICE.

17:24.416 --> 17:28.208
I'M NOT JUST
A NAIVE OLD SOFTIE,
DEAR.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.667
I RECOGNIZE DRUE
FOR THE DUPLICITOUS,
SMOOTH-TALKING

17:30.667 --> 17:33.875
BUTT-KISSER HE IS.

17:33.875 --> 17:37.542
AND NOW THAT
YOU AND I HAVE
SOLD THIS HOUSE,

17:37.542 --> 17:40.125
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
SOME POOR FOOL
TO PACK UP AND BOX

17:40.125 --> 17:42.500
30 YEARS OF JUNK
I'VE ACCUMULATED

17:42.500 --> 17:45.333
IN THE DARK
OF MY ATTIC.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.667
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE ON MY TEAM.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.834
MM-HMM.

17:59.750 --> 18:02.041
YOU'RE A LUCKY GIRL, JEN.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.625
A FELLOW COULD
GET USED TO THESE
ACCOMMODATIONS.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.417
[LAUGHS]
OK, YOU ARE
CREEPING ME OUT.

18:05.417 --> 18:10.375

A RIDE OVER?

18:17.583 --> 18:21.250

18:37.917 --> 18:39.542
YEAH, SURE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:41.041 --> 18:42.792
IS THAT YOUR SPEECH?

18:42.792 --> 18:46.041
NO, UM...IT'S ACTUALLY
A LETTER WRITTEN TO ME

18:46.041 --> 18:48.625
FROM MY MOM.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.708
SHE WROTE IT
BEFORE SHE DIED,

18:49.708 --> 18:52.125
AND BESSIE'S BEEN
SAVING IT EVER SINCE.

18:52.125 --> 18:52.583
WOW.

18:52.583 --> 18:53.625
YEAH.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.542
UH...

18:58.625 --> 18:59.875
HAVE YOU OPENED IT YET?

19:02.625 --> 19:04.333
I TRIED, AND, UH...

19:04.333 --> 19:05.458
EVERY TIME I GO
TO OPEN IT...

19:09.500 --> 19:12.458
I REMEMBER WHAT SHE
WAS LIKE AT THE END.

19:15.041 --> 19:21.041
YOU KNOW, SO...
STILL AND, UM...

19:21.041 --> 19:23.125
SO MUCH PAIN
AND SUFFERING.

19:23.125 --> 19:25.291
I JUST KIND OF FREEZE UP.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.000
BUT THAT
BEING SAID, UM...

19:31.000 --> 19:35.208
I STILL
HAVE TO KNOW, SO...

19:35.208 --> 19:37.000
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD READ IT
FOR ME.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.875
I'D BE HONORED.

TO THE FINE ART
OF PROCRASTINATION.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.583
WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

22:20.583 --> 22:22.625
WELL, GOOD. IF YOU'RE
GONNA AVOID WORK,
AVOID IT IN STYLE.

22:22.625 --> 22:26.291
HEY, GUYS.
GOT SOMEBODY WHO'S
DYING TO SAY HELLO.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.000
HEY, DAWSON!

22:28.834 --> 22:31.166
OH! JOEY!

22:31.166 --> 22:32.583
YOU LOOK GREAT!

22:32.583 --> 22:34.792
OH, THANK YOU.
SO DO YOU.

22:34.792 --> 22:36.792
Dawson: WOW, ITALY
MUST AGREE WITH YOU
IN A BIG WAY.

22:36.792 --> 22:37.834
DID YOU
HAVE A GOOD TIME?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.875
OH, DON'T EVEN
GET HER STARTED.

22:39.875 --> 22:42.625
NO. OH, MY GOD.
YOU GUYS, IT IS HEAVEN.

22:42.625 --> 22:45.208
YOU HAVE TO GO,
ALL OF YOU, RIGHT NOW.

22:45.208 --> 22:47.291
I THINK THAT'S CODE
FOR "SHE HAD
A GOOD TIME."

22:47.291 --> 22:48.542
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.
THE ARCHITECTURE,

22:48.542 --> 22:53.166
THE MEN, THE FOOD.
DID I MENTION THE MEN?

22:53.166 --> 22:55.583
[KNOCK KNOCK]

23:00.166 --> 23:01.708
MR. KASDAN.

23:01.708 --> 23:02.792
PACEY.

23:04.542 --> 23:05.917
MAY I?

23:07.959 --> 23:10.125
SURE. COME ON IN.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.625
WELL, IF YOU AND I
HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
TO EACH OTHER,

23:13.625 --> 23:17.375
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
IT COULD POSSIBLY BE.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.250
FAIR ENOUGH.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.333
I'LL GET RIGHT
TO THE POINT.

23:22.333 --> 23:25.125
DID YOU STUDY
FOR THAT FINAL

23:25.125 --> 23:27.834
YOU SO DRAMATICALLY
WALKED OUT ON?

23:27.834 --> 23:31.000
I CAN CATEGORICALLY
SAY THAT I STUDIED
MY ASS OFF, SIR.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.500
CARE TO PROVE IT?

23:34.708 --> 23:36.083
YOU DID HEAR
EVERYTHING

23:36.083 --> 23:38.542
THAT I HAD TO SAY
IN CLASS TODAY,
DIDN'T YOU?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.041
OH, I DID.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.166
YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT

23:44.166 --> 23:47.375
OR A PUNCH LINE.

23:48.083 --> 23:52.750
YOU ARE WHY I TEACH.

23:52.750 --> 23:57.083
THOSE HONOR
STUDENTS THAT
TURN YOUR STOMACH...

23:57.083 --> 23:58.667
THEY DON'T NEED ME.

23:58.667 --> 24:02.166
THEY'RE GONNA FORGET ME
AS SOON AS THEY
WALK OUT THE DOOR.

24:04.417 --> 24:06.583
BUT YOU...

24:06.583 --> 24:08.125
I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING
I'M GONNA BE TELLING
THIS STORY

24:08.125 --> 24:10.583
FOR YEARS TO COME.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.083
AND IF THAT SHOULD
TURN OUT TO BE
THE CASE,

24:12.083 --> 24:14.583
PLEASE DESCRIBE ME

24:14.583 --> 24:18.583
AS A STRAPPING,
HANDSOME MAN,

24:18.583 --> 24:20.959
POSSESSED
OF AN IMMENSE
CHARITY

24:20.959 --> 24:23.208
AND A GREAT,
GREAT GOODWILL.

24:23.208 --> 24:24.750
I CAN DO THAT.

24:24.750 --> 24:28.333
MR. WITTER,
YOU HAVE 45 MINUTES.

24:34.875 --> 24:35.959
Drue: YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.

24:35.959 --> 24:38.250
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THE TIMING

24:38.250 --> 24:39.583
FOR THE SPRINKLER
SYSTEM'S OVER HERE.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.500
DRUE, I'VE GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

24:41.500 --> 24:45.041
RIGHT.
AND "IT'S QUIET OUT.

24:45.041 --> 24:46.542
MAYBE A LITTLE
TOO QUIET."

24:46.542 --> 24:48.792
WHOOOO. SHALL I
ADD THAT TO THE LIST

24:48.792 --> 24:50.750
OF B-MOVIE CLICHES
YOU'VE BEEN SPOUTING?

24:54.667 --> 24:57.000
ALL RIGHT, THIS IT.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.583
THAT TIMER CONTROLS
THE SPRINKLER SETTINGS.

24:58.583 --> 24:59.917
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS RE-SET THE TIMER

24:59.917 --> 25:02.750
SO THE SPRINKLERS
COME ON DURING
GRADUATION,

25:02.750 --> 25:05.333
SOAKING THE CROWD,
AND THEREFORE

25:05.333 --> 25:07.500
TRANSFORMING
A RATHER HO-HUM
CEREMONY

25:07.500 --> 25:10.166
INTO A GLORIOUS
LIQUID WONDERLAND.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.333
YOU AIM HIGH.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.458
AS DO YOU,
MY ACCOMPLICE IN CRIME.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.125
Peskin:
MR. VALENTINE.

25:16.125 --> 25:17.583
MISS LINDLEY.

25:17.583 --> 25:21.041
I WOULD BE DELIGHTED
IF YOU'D COME WITH ME.

25:24.667 --> 25:28.500
Andie: WOW!
THIS IS SO COOL.
EVERYONE IS HERE.

25:28.500 --> 25:33.375
OH, PERFECT.
OK. THANK YOU.

25:33.375 --> 25:37.166
SO, WELL, I JUST
WANT TO SAY...

25:37.166 --> 25:40.417
YOU KNOW, I HEARD
ABOUT YOU AND GRETCHEN,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

25:40.417 --> 25:42.166
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S OK.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.291
UH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW.
THE BREAKUP HURT,

25:44.291 --> 25:45.417
AND I'M SAD
THAT IT'S OVER,

25:45.417 --> 25:48.542
BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I HAVE THIS CLOUD

25:48.542 --> 25:50.250
HANGING OVER MY HEAD
THAT WON'T GO AWAY.

25:50.250 --> 25:53.083
WOW! SOMEONE'S CHANGED.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.708
NO ENDLESS REPLAYS
OF WHAT WENT WRONG,

25:56.708 --> 25:59.917
NO DARK PERIOD
OF PAIN AND REGRET?

25:59.917 --> 26:01.333
THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH
MY WEEKEND.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.458
AH!
[LAUGHS]

26:02.458 --> 26:05.542
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW,
I GOT IT OUT
OF MY SYSTEM,

26:05.542 --> 26:08.041
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
WHEN I LOOK BACK
ON IT,

26:08.041 --> 26:11.625
I DON'T LOOK BACK
ON IT WITH AN OUNCE
OF REGRET.

26:11.625 --> 26:13.041
YOU KNOW? JOEY
WAS MY FIRST LOVE,

26:13.041 --> 26:15.041
BUT GRETCHEN WAS
MY FIRST MATURE
RELATIONSHIP,

26:15.041 --> 26:17.417
AND SHE
MADE ME REALIZE
THAT I AM CAPABLE

26:17.417 --> 26:18.875
OF LOVING SOMEBODY.

26:18.875 --> 26:23.250
I WISH I WERE A MEMORY
LIKE THAT TO SOMEONE,

26:23.250 --> 26:25.917
YOU KNOW, TO SOMEONE
WHO THINKS BACK ON ME
WITH A SMILE,

26:25.917 --> 26:30.333
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE
LONG SINCE GONE
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.792
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU ARE.

26:50.166 --> 26:52.166
PACEY!

26:53.625 --> 26:55.458
HEY, HI!

26:55.458 --> 26:56.417
OHH!

26:56.417 --> 26:58.917
HOW ARE YOU, ANDIE?

26:58.917 --> 27:00.750
OHH, GREAT NOW.

27:01.917 --> 27:02.959
MMM.

27:02.959 --> 27:04.500
THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME
COMING FOR YOU 2.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.500
YOU'VE MANAGED TO, UH...

27:07.500 --> 27:08.792
COMPILE QUITE
A DIRTY LAUNDRY LIST

27:08.792 --> 27:12.000
DURING YOUR BRIEF
SCHOLASTIC CAREERS,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.125
EVERYTHING FROM DABBLING
IN ECSTASY

27:13.125 --> 27:17.417
TO PUBLIC INTOXICATION,
RIGGING YEARBOOK PHOTOS,

27:17.417 --> 27:19.750
TO MY PERSONAL FAVORITE--

27:19.750 --> 27:22.875
DUMPING MY SAILBOAT
IN THE SCHOOL POOL.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.667
I GUESS WE CAN COLOR
YOUR PARENTS PROUD, HUH?

27:25.667 --> 27:28.834
WHAT IF I SWEAR TO YOU
I DIDN'T DO THE BOAT?

27:28.834 --> 27:30.834
SHOULD WE ADD
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR

27:30.834 --> 27:34.083
TO YOUR LIST
OF DUBIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS,
MR. VALENTINE?

27:34.083 --> 27:37.041
SO, WHAT,
WE'RE HOSTAGES?

27:37.041 --> 27:37.583
Peskin: HA!

27:37.583 --> 27:39.583
NO, YOUNG LADY.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.125
YOU'RE MY AUDIENCE.

27:41.125 --> 27:44.083
IF MY AUDIENCE
WERE TO LEAVE EARLY,

27:44.083 --> 27:47.417
THE PERFORMER WOULD BE
DEEPLY OFFENDED.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.417
[WHISPERING]
Dude, he's gonna
keep us here all night.

27:52.417 --> 27:53.500
WE'RE GONNA MISS
THE PARTY.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.667
THE PARTY'S RIGHT HERE,
MR. VALENTINE.

27:56.667 --> 27:59.625
DO YOU LIKE CELLO MUSIC?

27:59.625 --> 28:00.708
I MUST CONFESS,

28:00.708 --> 28:03.500
IT'S BEEN A LIFELONG
PASSION OF MINE.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.083
THE CHILLING LOWS,
THE VIBRANT HIGHS.

28:06.083 --> 28:09.500
STILL, I HAVEN'T HAD
A LESSON IN...

28:09.500 --> 28:12.166
MMM, 10 OR 11 YEARS.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.166
[PLAYING BADLY]

28:26.792 --> 28:30.291
UM, YOU KNOW,
JACK'S BEEN WRITING ME

28:30.291 --> 28:32.917
AND, UH, WELL,
HE TOLD ME ABOUT
YOU AND JOEY.

28:32.917 --> 28:37.625
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY
I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.375
I KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE MEANS TO YOU.

28:39.375 --> 28:41.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

28:41.875 --> 28:43.417
I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

28:43.417 --> 28:46.000
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT TO SEE YOU SAD,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.458
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU...

28:47.458 --> 28:49.917
ACTUALLY THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

28:49.917 --> 28:51.041
NAME IT.

28:51.041 --> 28:53.834
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT IT'S LIKE OUT THERE?

28:53.834 --> 28:55.041
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
OUT ON YOUR OWN.

28:55.041 --> 28:58.792
OOH, WELL, IT'S SCARY
AT FIRST, YOU KNOW.

28:58.792 --> 29:03.000
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE,
BUT--HA HA--

29:03.000 --> 29:06.041
IT TOOK NO TIME FOR THEM
TO GET TO KNOW ME.

29:06.041 --> 29:09.000
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,
I HAD ALL THESE FRIENDS

29:09.000 --> 29:11.875
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I WASN'T LONELY.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.583
I JUST--I REALIZED
THAT THE LONGER I WAS
AWAY FROM HERE,

29:15.583 --> 29:19.417
LEAVING CAPESIDE
WASN'T AN END.
IT WAS A BEGINNING.

29:19.417 --> 29:21.542
SO...

29:21.542 --> 29:23.542
OK, I GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

29:25.750 --> 29:29.125
I GOT AN OFFER, A JOB OFFER,
TO CREW ON A BOAT THIS SUMMER,

29:29.125 --> 29:31.208
BUT IT MEANS GETTING
ON A PLANE TO MIAMI,

29:31.208 --> 29:34.125
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE BOAT LEAVES
FOR THE CARIBBEAN.

29:34.125 --> 29:37.792
AND IS THIS SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO DO?

29:37.792 --> 29:38.917
YEAH.

29:38.917 --> 29:42.083
YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING
I REALLY WANT TO DO.

29:42.083 --> 29:45.250
I AM SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE RIGHT NOW.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.625
UH, OK...

29:47.625 --> 29:50.375
I DID IT. HA HA!

29:50.375 --> 29:53.000
I DID IT.
I PASSED MY FINAL EXAM.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.417
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE.

29:54.417 --> 29:57.208
AAH! OH, MY GOD!
I KNEW IT!

29:57.208 --> 29:59.208
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW YOU COULD!

29:59.208 --> 30:01.291
WELL, THAT'S PUTS YOU
ONE UP ON ME.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.333
OK, SO WHY HAVEN'T YOU
TOLD EVERYBODY ELSE?

30:03.333 --> 30:05.000
I MEAN, THEY'RE
DYING TO KNOW.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.041
I DON'T NEED TO TELL THEM.

30:07.041 --> 30:09.625
I DON'T NEED
TO COMPARE MYSELF
TO THEM ANYMORE.

30:09.625 --> 30:11.333
I DID THIS THING
FOR MYSELF.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.500
I JUST WANT TO FEEL
GOOD ABOUT IT.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.500
ALL I WANT TO DO NOW
IS GET UP ON THAT STAGE

30:15.500 --> 30:17.917
AND FEEL THE SUN
AGAINST MY FACE AND JUST...

30:17.917 --> 30:20.583
KNOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE

30:20.583 --> 30:22.417
THAT I CAN OVERCOME ANYTHING.

30:22.417 --> 30:26.500
SO, UH,
WHY'D YOU TELL ME?

30:26.500 --> 30:29.083
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON
IN MY LIFE WHO EVER TOLD ME

30:29.083 --> 30:31.708
THAT I COULD BE MORE THAN
I WAS AND BELIEVED IT.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.417
SO I GUESS
THAT'S THANK YOU.

30:37.417 --> 30:38.875
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:39.834 --> 30:42.417
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, ANDIE.

30:42.417 --> 30:43.792
MMM! YOU, TOO!

30:43.792 --> 30:46.000
OH, GOD!
SO THE CARIBBEAN!

30:46.000 --> 30:49.041
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'LL BE IN FLORENCE.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.166
GLAD THAT YOU MADE IT.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.583
YEAH.

31:18.583 --> 31:21.917
THIS WAS A NICE PARTY.

31:29.125 --> 31:32.041
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT TOMORROW.

31:32.041 --> 31:34.625
WHAT ABOUT THIS
TOMORROWLAND?

31:34.625 --> 31:38.500
DOES IT LOOK EVEN
REMOTELY BRIGHT?

31:40.583 --> 31:45.875
IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T WHEN IT
HELD THE PROSPECT OF NEVER
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

31:48.291 --> 31:53.458
HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT
FROM THE HERE AND NOW?

31:59.708 --> 32:01.667
I THINK I--I SHOULD PROBABLY
GO OFF AND LIVE MY OWN LIFE

32:01.667 --> 32:04.041
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

32:06.250 --> 32:11.667
THAT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THIS IS HOW I WANT IT
TO END BETWEEN US.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.875
SO HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING...

32:20.083 --> 32:22.834
IF I WERE LUCKY ENOUGH
ONE DAY

32:22.834 --> 32:25.917
TO FIND MYSELF OWNING
A SAILBOAT AGAIN,

32:25.917 --> 32:30.166
AND I WERE TO ASK
THE WOMAN THAT I LOVE
TO GO SAILING WITH ME...

32:32.166 --> 32:33.959
WOULD SHE?

32:39.083 --> 32:42.834
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO ASK, PACE.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.875
I'LL SEE YOU.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.250
I'LL SEE YOU, JOEY.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.750
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
PICTURES BEFORE
THE CEREMONY,

33:28.750 --> 33:29.959
AND THEY SAID
NO LATER THAN 10:00.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.083
YOU'VE STILL GOT TIME!

33:31.083 --> 33:33.834
BESSIE, I DON'T WANT
TO BE LATE.

33:33.834 --> 33:36.291
YOU WON'T BE LATE.
JUST HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

33:38.834 --> 33:39.208
HA HA!

33:45.166 --> 33:48.875
SO DID YOU EVER GET AROUND
TO READING MOM'S LETTER?

33:50.625 --> 33:52.000
YEAH.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.458
I DON'T WANT TO BE
NOSEY OR ANYTHING, BUT--

33:55.458 --> 33:58.375
IF I TOLD YOU NOW,
WE'D BOTH START CRYING,

33:58.375 --> 33:58.875
BUT TO SUMMARIZE,

33:58.875 --> 34:01.125
SHE WAS RIGHT.

34:01.125 --> 34:02.333
WHAT'S THAT?

34:02.333 --> 34:05.000
YOU DID A GREAT JOB
TAKING CARE OF ME.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.708
OH, JOEY, YOU'RE SWEET,
BUT REALLY, IT'S NOT FAIR.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.125
YOU DESERVED A MOM.

34:09.125 --> 34:11.375
BESSIE, I GOT 2.

34:11.375 --> 34:16.250
AND YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
WANT US TO START CRYING.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.875
I LOVE YOU.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.500
I LOVE YOU.

34:27.708 --> 34:29.041
WELL, LOOK THERE,
LILY.

34:29.041 --> 34:31.166
THAT'LL BE YOU
ONE DAY SOON.

34:31.166 --> 34:32.917
WHAT, THE HAPPY GRADUATE
OR THE PROUD MOTHER?

34:32.917 --> 34:35.166
WELL, WHY NOT BOTH?

34:35.166 --> 34:37.875
ALTHOUGH PREFERABLY
NOT AT THE SAME TIME.

34:43.667 --> 34:44.375
WHAT'S THIS?

34:44.375 --> 34:46.875
OH, JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING

34:46.875 --> 34:48.958
FROM A COUPLE
OF PROUD PARENTS.

34:48.958 --> 34:51.792
YOU DIDN'T--I...

34:54.708 --> 34:55.917
WOW!

34:55.917 --> 34:58.542
THANK YOU.

34:58.542 --> 34:59.083
YOU LIKE IT?

34:59.083 --> 35:00.834
ARE YOU KIDDING?

35:00.834 --> 35:01.875
I LOVE IT.

35:01.875 --> 35:04.667
WELL, THERE'S
AN INSCRIPTION ON THE BACK.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.959
"IF YOU WILL IT,
IT IS NO DREAM."

35:07.959 --> 35:10.375
WHEN I BRAG TO PEOPLE
AND I TELL THEM THAT MY SON

35:10.375 --> 35:12.083
WANTS TO GO OFF TO HOLLYWOOD
TO BE A FILMMAKER,

35:12.083 --> 35:13.875
THEY WARN ME.

35:13.875 --> 35:16.041
THEY SAY YOU'LL BE
EATEN ALIVE.

35:16.041 --> 35:18.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THEM?

35:18.333 --> 35:19.333
I SAY,

35:19.333 --> 35:23.000
"YOU DON'T KNOW MY SON."

35:25.750 --> 35:32.291
I JUST WANT TO THANK
YOU GUYS FOR ALWAYS
BELIEVING IN ME.

35:32.291 --> 35:34.625
THAT, UH...

35:34.625 --> 35:38.166
IT MEANT A LOT.

35:40.959 --> 35:42.500

35:42.500 --> 35:44.792
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

35:53.125 --> 35:55.125

35:55.125 --> 35:58.291
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS UMPROMPTED
INTRUSION?

35:58.291 --> 36:00.750
OH, I JUST THOUGHT
I'D STOP BY AND OFFER
MY CONGRATULATIONS

36:00.750 --> 36:01.834
AND, UH...

36:01.834 --> 36:04.625
WHAT, WISH ME GOOD LUCK?

36:04.625 --> 36:06.291
OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, YEAH.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.083
SO, TELL ME, UH...

36:10.083 --> 36:12.166
YOU NEED SOME MONEY?

36:12.166 --> 36:14.000
YOU KNOW, NOT THAT I'D
GIVE YOU ANY, BUT, UM...

36:14.000 --> 36:16.375
NO. I'LL ACTUALLY
BE FINE,

36:16.375 --> 36:18.333
JUST SO LONG AS I CAN
STORE ALL OF MY STUFF

36:18.333 --> 36:20.000
AT YOUR PLACE
THIS SUMMER,
I'LL BE A HAPPY CAMPER.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.500
SO ANOTHER
EXCITING SUMMER AHEAD
FOR MY LITTLE BROTHER.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.333
I'M GLAD.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.834
YOU REALLY DESERVE IT.

36:29.834 --> 36:32.417
WELL, DOUGIE,
YOU CAME HALFWAY CLOSE

36:32.417 --> 36:34.750
TO SOUNDING LIKE YOU
ACTUALLY MEANT THAT.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.208
BECAUSE I DID.

36:39.834 --> 36:42.166
YOU KNOW,
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

36:42.166 --> 36:44.834
IT WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE
SHAME FOR ME

36:44.834 --> 36:46.708
TO LET ANOTHER DAY
LIKE TODAY PASS

36:46.708 --> 36:49.875
WITHOUT EVER TELLING YOU
HOW MUCH I'VE ALWAYS
LOOKED UP TO YOU

36:49.875 --> 36:51.041
AS MY BIG BROTHER.

36:51.041 --> 36:54.375
OR MENTIONED THE FACT
THAT I DO ACTUALLY THINK

36:54.375 --> 36:56.208
THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL...

36:56.208 --> 36:57.792
MAKE A GIRL VERY HAPPY.

36:57.792 --> 37:03.250
MEAN TO TELL ME THAT
YOU'VE, UH, ACTUALLY
ACCEPTED MY HETEROSEXUALITY?

37:03.250 --> 37:07.625
NO, NO, I SAID HAPPY, DOUG,
NOT SEXUALLY HAPPY.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.166
Andie: HERE, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU GOT YOUR TASSEL
ON THE WRONG SIDE.

37:12.166 --> 37:13.166
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.166
YEAH, IT DOES MATTER!

37:14.166 --> 37:15.667
AFTER THE CEREMONY,

37:15.667 --> 37:16.750
I'M JUST GOING TO THROW
THE CAP UP IN THE AIR
ANYWAY.

37:16.750 --> 37:18.375
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO THROW THE CAPS, REMEMBER?

37:18.375 --> 37:19.959
"THE POINTY ENDS
MIGHT HURT SOMEBODY."

37:19.959 --> 37:21.041
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

37:21.041 --> 37:22.875
BET YOU I CAN THROW
MY CAP HIGHER THAN YOU.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.792
JACK, THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY YET.

37:25.792 --> 37:27.250
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?

37:27.250 --> 37:32.208
NOTHING. ACTUALLY
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG WHILE,

37:32.208 --> 37:36.333
I CAN HONESTLY SAY
THAT THERE IS
NOTHING WRONG.

37:36.333 --> 37:41.041
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE
GOING TO STAY IN ITALY.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.375
I DEFERRED HARVARD
BY A YEAR.

37:42.375 --> 37:45.583
IT'S--IT'S JUST THAT
RIGHT NOW

37:45.583 --> 37:47.708
I CAN'T IMAGINE
BEING HAPPIER
ANYWHERE ELSE.

37:47.708 --> 37:49.083
HEY, ANDIE, I GET IT.

37:49.083 --> 37:50.750

YEAH.

37:50.750 --> 37:51.750
REALLY?

37:51.750 --> 37:53.041
YEAH.

37:53.041 --> 37:54.417
YOU DON'T CARE?
YOU'RE NOT UPSET?

37:54.417 --> 37:55.500
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TRY TO CONVINCE
ME TO STAY

37:55.500 --> 37:57.708
AND YOU DON'T THINK
I'M BEING IDIOTIC?

37:57.708 --> 37:59.166
WELL, IDIOTIC, YES,

37:59.166 --> 38:01.125
BUT IT'S THE SMARTEST
IDIOTIC THING YOU'VE
EVER DONE.

38:01.125 --> 38:02.959
JUST PROMISE ME
I CAN VISIT.

38:02.959 --> 38:05.125
ONLY IF YOU BRING
THAT MAN OF YOURS.

38:05.125 --> 38:07.917
LOVE YOU TO DEATH,
LITTLE SIS.

38:07.917 --> 38:09.458
LOVE YOU MORE,
LITTLE BROTHER.

38:09.458 --> 38:10.458
HA HA!

38:12.291 --> 38:13.834
OHH!

38:13.834 --> 38:16.542
Grams: YOU LOOK RELAXED
AND RADIANT.

38:16.542 --> 38:17.917
THAT'S WHAT 3 HOURS
OF CELLO MUSIC
WILL DO TO YOU.

38:17.917 --> 38:20.125
HMM!

38:20.125 --> 38:21.959
BY THE WAY,
IF I HAVEN'T SAID IT
ENOUGH ALREADY,

38:21.959 --> 38:23.500
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

38:23.500 --> 38:27.542
WELL, I'M ONLY TOO WELL
AWARE OF THAT MAN'S
TASTE IN MUSIC.

38:27.542 --> 38:30.625
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN
PUNISHED ENOUGH ALREADY.

38:30.625 --> 38:37.000
BESIDES, YOU'D HAVE TO
DO A LOT WORSE TO UNDO HOW
VERY PROUD I AM OF YOU TODAY.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.667
THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.542
YOUR PARENTS
ARE SO CUTE.

38:55.542 --> 38:58.375
THEY LOOK LIKE TOTAL
EMOTIONAL TRAIN WRECKS.

38:58.375 --> 39:00.333
YEAH, THEY ARE.

39:03.250 --> 39:06.708
YOU KNOW,
ON OCCASIONS LIKE THIS,

39:06.708 --> 39:10.291
IT'S NICE THAT WE CAN
DRESS UP IN POLYESTER
CHOIR ROBES

39:10.291 --> 39:11.667
AND STUPID HATS,

39:11.667 --> 39:13.834
SIT IN THE SUN
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
TO MARK THE OCCASION.

39:13.834 --> 39:16.500

CAME UP WITH THIS
WHOLE OUTFIT?

39:16.500 --> 39:19.166

YOU REALLY WANT TO BE WEARING

39:19.166 --> 39:20.750
THE DAY YOU KNOW PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO BE TAKING
PICTURES?

39:20.750 --> 39:22.834
IS THAT A SMILE?

39:22.834 --> 39:26.708
DID I GET YOU TO FORGET
ABOUT YOUR SPEECH
AT LEAST FOR A SECOND?

39:26.708 --> 39:27.917
YES, YOU DID.

39:27.917 --> 39:29.083
OK.

39:29.083 --> 39:30.458
TELL ME MORE.

39:30.458 --> 39:31.834
I'M NOT ON MY A-LIST MATERIAL.

39:31.834 --> 39:33.834
SADLY ENOUGH,
THAT WAS MY A-LIST MATERIAL.

39:33.834 --> 39:34.667
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GO SIT UP ON STAGE

39:34.667 --> 39:36.708

OF THE SMART KIDS.

39:39.125 --> 39:40.750

39:41.917 --> 39:43.542

MS. JOSEPHINE POTTER!

40:07.041 --> 40:08.708
PRINCIPAL PESKIN,

40:08.708 --> 40:11.333
OUR FAMILIES,

40:11.333 --> 40:12.792
MY FELLOW GRADUATES,

40:12.792 --> 40:17.250
I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU
AWARE OF THE SIMILARITIES
THAT WE SHARE.

40:17.250 --> 40:22.834
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE FEELING,
OUTSIDE OF MY INCREDIBLE
STAGE FRIGHT,

40:22.834 --> 40:25.875
THE SAME THINGS
THAT I'M FEELING--

40:25.875 --> 40:29.208
PRIDE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT,
CLOSURE AND REGRET,

40:29.208 --> 40:31.917
AND A HOPEFUL OUTLOOK
ON THE FUTURE.

40:31.917 --> 40:36.166
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED ME TO ELABORATE
ON THOSE FEELINGS.

40:36.166 --> 40:40.291
INSTEAD I--I WANTED
TO SHARE SOMETHING PERSONAL

40:40.291 --> 40:42.792
AND TELL YOU THAT...

40:42.792 --> 40:46.917
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY
LIFE WHO ARE GONE NOW,

40:46.917 --> 40:48.166
PEOPLE I MISS VERY MUCH

40:48.166 --> 40:53.375
AND PEOPLE WHO I AM HAUNTED BY
IN DIFFERENT WAYS,

40:53.375 --> 40:57.125
BUT WHETHER WE'RE SEPARATED
BY DEATH OR MERELY DISTANCE,

40:57.125 --> 41:01.834
I KNOW THAT THEY'RE
STILL WITH ME BECAUSE
I KEEP THEM IN MY HEART.

41:03.542 --> 41:08.375
THE TRUTH IS, IN TIME,
THAT'S ALL THAT WE'RE GOING
TO BE TO EACH OTHER ANYWAY,

41:08.375 --> 41:12.291
THIS POPULATION OF MEMORIES,

41:12.291 --> 41:17.125
SOME WONDERFUL
AND ENDEARING,

41:17.125 --> 41:18.750
SOME LESS SO.

41:20.166 --> 41:24.291
BUT TAKEN TOGETHER,
THOSE MEMORIES HELP
MAKE US WHO WE ARE

41:24.291 --> 41:26.250
AND WHO WE WILL BE.

41:26.250 --> 41:29.250
SO WHETHER YOU'RE HERE
WITH EACH OTHER NOW

41:29.250 --> 41:30.625
OR YOU'RE MERELY
IN EACH OTHER'S THOUGHTS,

41:30.625 --> 41:33.750
REMEMBER EACH OTHER
ON THAT ROAD AHEAD.

41:35.333 --> 41:40.500
AND I HOPE THAT NO MATTER
WHERE YOUR TRAVELS
LEAD YOU IN THIS LIFE...

41:42.458 --> 41:45.417
YOU'LL ALWAYS TAKE
CAPESIDE WITH YOU.

41:47.792 --> 41:49.250
