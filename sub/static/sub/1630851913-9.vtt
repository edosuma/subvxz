00:39.706 --> 00:41.416
[man 1 in Spanish] It's crooked-

00:42.459 --> 00:43.668
[man 2] What'd you say?

00:44.210 --> 00:45.920
It's a little crooked!

00:47.338 --> 00:48.840
Drop it a little.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.059
[man 1] Cool. Let's go…

[man 1] Hey, Güero…

04:55.628 --> 04:58.131
[Palma] Who taught
these fucking guys to play?

05:00.049 --> 05:03.011
Been too long, brother…

05:05.471 --> 05:06.806
[Chapo] How are you?

05:06.889 --> 05:10.518
Save me a seat?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.772
Sure.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.816
What's up?

05:22.655 --> 05:24.157
[Mayo] …Arellanos are drowning.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.701
That's why they're hitting back at us.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.911
Now's the time to hold 'em under.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.208
My mother used to say,

05:34.292 --> 05:39.005
"Ask God to move a mountain,
be ready to wake up next to a shovel."

05:40.256 --> 05:42.467
I'm ready to dig, man.

05:45.595 --> 05:52.060
Been pushing your guys for more product
to move through Tijuana…

05:52.143 --> 05:54.395
I'm getting the run-around.

05:55.938 --> 05:59.275
Things have gotten too loud, Mayo.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.611
Arellanos tried to kill you, man.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.782
Something change?

06:07.325 --> 06:11.162
Make it work with what you got.
Or go back to Sinaloa.

06:14.082 --> 06:14.916
Alright.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.005
Be easier keeping things "quiet"

06:21.089 --> 06:23.299
if the Army hadn't hit
two of our spots last week…

06:23.382 --> 06:25.301
Army's not my problem, man.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.262
I know…

06:29.347 --> 06:30.765
Far from it.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.934
Ever since this war broke out,

06:33.017 --> 06:36.187
Army's hit every organization in Mexico…
except Juárez.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.524
Something on your mind, Mayo?

06:41.609 --> 06:45.905
Whatever you're doing,
it's money well-spent.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.077
Or maybe it's just good luck.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.037
Maybe.

06:53.996 --> 06:54.997
Sure…

06:59.043 --> 07:00.336

07:59.520 --> 08:00.855
Done for the night, boss?

08:04.025 --> 08:05.776
The fuck you doing in my truck?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.780
Was gonna move it.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.783
Some fucking kids were snooping around…

08:12.867 --> 08:14.452
You know how they are.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.550
Don't ever touch my truck.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.598
Won't happen again, boss.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.610
Sorry…

08:49.362 --> 08:50.363
Hold up.

09:02.708 --> 09:07.338
What's that girl's name?
One who serves drinks, with the fine ass.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.926
Lucia.

09:13.135 --> 09:13.970
Lucia.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.848
Cool.

[man on tape recorder]
<i>Tell Barron to start with the army.</i>

[clicks tape recorder]

09:38.578 --> 09:39.579
[in English] Anything?

09:40.913 --> 09:42.039
Not on this one either.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.585
That's Ramón Arellano's voice
on that tape.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.044
That's not Ramón.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.547
[Providencio] This kid's lying to us.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.798
[Alex] It isn't him, man.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.469
Intelligence reviewed these tapes
two weeks ago.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.973
-They made a mistake.
-Fuck this kid, Walt.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.815
Take it back down to Intelligence
and have them make the correction.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.403
[Alex in Spanish] I'm a little hungry…

10:13.613 --> 10:15.573
Been working hard on this.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.783
Maybe some Burger King?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.744
-Go fuck yourself.
-[Walt in English] Hey.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.500
He needs a girlfriend.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.589
Yeah.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.341
Probably.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.011
No one's heard anything on my brother?

10:41.015 --> 10:41.849
No.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.560
Not yet.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.278
Alfredo is smart.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.658
He'll be okay for a while.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.923
-Get started on the next tape. All right?
-Okay.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.392
[Providencio in Spanish]
That kid's a piece of shit.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.436
[in English] Pushing his head
through a wall won't get us Benjamín.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.981
Please, just get him something to eat.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.276
Kid's all we got.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.165
[dramatic suspenseful music playing]

12:09.687 --> 12:11.522
[Andréa] <i>Her name's Sofia Elvira Herrera.</i>

12:11.605 --> 12:15.025
She owns the account we've been on…

12:15.109 --> 12:18.404
The Juárez cartel's
paying her $200,000 every month.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.073
Question is, why?

12:22.825 --> 12:23.701
Who is she?

12:23.784 --> 12:28.664
Former beauty queen. From Monterrey.
Won the pageant there twice.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.167
'83, again in '85.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.960
And before then?

12:34.044 --> 12:36.255
Can't find anything on her before 1983.

12:36.964 --> 12:40.759
No property listing,
car registrations… nothing.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.097
"Sofia" changed her name.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.142
Only explanation…

12:48.225 --> 12:51.645
You're sure she's the one
handling the money?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.733
She's been at the bank each time.
Matches when withdrawals were made.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.943
Can't be a coincidence.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.615
What're our other angles
into this account?

13:02.698 --> 13:04.033
This is it.

13:04.909 --> 13:09.413
This woman's the conduit, as you say -
between Juárez and Hank,

13:09.497 --> 13:10.789
then something connects them.

13:10.873 --> 13:11.916
Go back to the archives…

13:11.999 --> 13:16.545
Figure out who Sofia was
before she changed her name…

13:21.217 --> 13:24.053
[Hank over phone] <i>…The situation</i>
<i>we discussed in Tijuana.</i>

13:24.136 --> 13:25.763
<i>I'm hearing it's unresolved…</i>

13:26.889 --> 13:30.059
Told the Sinaloans they're on their own.

13:30.142 --> 13:34.480
Maybe that's the problem.
You need to take a firmer hand.

13:54.375 --> 13:59.713
Money moves around, man.
I don't fucking know.

13:59.797 --> 14:05.469
<i>That's why I want to take a closer look.</i>
<i>To see where it's "moving"…</i>

14:06.262 --> 14:11.725
I'm sending some men to Juárez.
To review our mutual enterprises…

14:11.809 --> 14:14.019
<i>Ensure there's no… misunderstandings.</i>

14:16.313 --> 14:21.443
If you're so worried, we can
shut this whole "partnership" down.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.823
<i>Save your accountants a trip…</i>

14:27.449 --> 14:28.784

The fuck you talking about?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.331
<i>The Cuban.</i>

14:34.415 --> 14:36.542
The black girl. In Havana.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.752
She still in that apartment
off Obispo boulevard?

14:38.836 --> 14:41.380
<i>Come on, man.</i>
<i>Why haven't you put her someplace nice?</i>

14:41.463 --> 14:45.551
<i>Or is that part of the excitement,</i>
<i>the exotic texture?</i>

14:46.719 --> 14:50.472
Heard of the DGI?
Dirrecion General De Intelligence.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.100
Cuba's secret police.

14:54.518 --> 14:57.271
<i>Its boss, he's an old friend…</i>

14:58.105 --> 15:03.736
Those men you pay to protect her…
they work for him.

15:04.987 --> 15:09.408
Play games with me, they'll pick her up.
Take her for a ride…

15:09.491 --> 15:11.577
And when they get bored
of doing whatever they want…

15:11.660 --> 15:13.996
they'll leave her in the street
for dogs to pick at.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.623
<i>We clear now?</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:21.545
<i>My men will arrive tomorrow.</i>
<i>Make sure they get whatever they need…</i>

15:22.588 --> 15:23.589

15:40.105 --> 15:41.607
[Victor] Stop fucking around.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.193
Found it.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.153
[chuckles]

15:49.073 --> 15:51.951
Fuck it. This is far enough.

15:58.916 --> 15:59.750

This kid in the picture your son?

16:29.697 --> 16:31.949
[man] Yeah. He's four…

16:32.032 --> 16:34.535
Too bad his dad's an asshole.

16:48.132 --> 16:48.966
Here.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.760
Take it…

16:57.766 --> 16:59.476
There's a shovel in the trunk.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.936
He's good there.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.569

I can't.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.157
Have things to do.

17:14.408 --> 17:15.534
Gotta figure your shit out, Victor.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.244
What the fuck's that mean?

17:17.327 --> 17:19.872
Means I gotta page you
to get hold of your ass lately.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.166
Don't think these dudes don't notice.
Been trying to cover for you.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.543
I got a thing with Tenci. Okay, Rogelio?

17:25.335 --> 17:28.797
She's been on me to spend more time.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.300
What do you want me to say?

17:32.801 --> 17:34.178

17:55.741 --> 17:56.575

His wife?

19:14.945 --> 19:17.030
Yeah, lights a candle for her
every Sunday.

She's sick.

We're always talking about it.

Sick how?

I saw it happen once. It's fucked up.

19:40.637 --> 19:44.266
Ramón would get high and talk
about how we all had to pray for her.

19:45.642 --> 19:49.855
This condition, describe it to me exactly.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.607
[Dorian] <i>…called lymphatic malformation.</i>

19:51.690 --> 19:54.902
From what I can tell,
looks pretty rare and difficult to treat.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.988
<i>Causes masses,</i>
<i>blockages to the lungs, the brain.</i>

19:58.071 --> 20:00.282
<i>If your source is right on this,</i>
<i>we might actually have something.</i>

20:00.365 --> 20:01.200
Sir?

20:01.909 --> 20:04.411
There aren't that many places
that specialize in this treatment.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.417
These clinics,
tell me you have addresses for them.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.669
Only four facilities
specialize in the disease.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.548
Three of them are in high-populated areas,
Tijuana, Guadalajara and Mexico City,

20:16.632 --> 20:18.884
and all of those tie
into larger hospitals.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.094
That is a bad fit
for a fugitive like Benjamín.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.055
Which narrows it down to this one.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.598
Just outside Cuernavaca.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.518
It's the smallest, it's private,
and it's in an upscale neighborhood.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.649
-We should look into it.
-San Diego already has.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.527
I got ahold of the clinic's database,
ran the list of patients.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.571
Turns out one of them
didn't provide a local address.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.491
Emergency contact
leads back to a P.O. box.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.911
Sir, this thing's real.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.502
Could be Benjamín
or just someone looking for privacy.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.920
Well, let's find out.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.881
Patient has an appointment
tomorrow afternoon.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.800
I spoke with the receptionist myself.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.266
Brief Providencio. Get a team together.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.351
Yes, sir.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.021
[Amado in Spanish] <i>So what are</i>
<i>these assholes gonna find?</i>

21:13.105 --> 21:15.274
[Corral] We've pulled out
millions of dollars already…

21:15.357 --> 21:18.485
If Hank looks closely,
that leaves a trace…

21:18.568 --> 21:20.862
How long'll it take
for them to figure it out?

21:20.946 --> 21:24.283
Who knows…not long.
What the fuck do we do?

21:24.366 --> 21:29.413
The money we got from the last Cali load.
It's a couple hundred million…

21:29.496 --> 21:32.666
Hank knows about it!
Won't replace what we've taken…

21:35.711 --> 21:37.838
We're not gonna replace it.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.233
[Andréa] Anything yet?

21:59.401 --> 22:01.987
[sighs] Not sure I know
where I'm supposed to start…

22:02.988 --> 22:05.657
She lived in Monterrey in the early '80s…

22:07.868 --> 22:10.120
Right. Thanks…

22:12.039 --> 22:15.208
-[speaking indistinctly]
-[men laughing]

22:15.292 --> 22:17.753
[Don Neto] The boys really love him.
Can't get enough…

22:18.754 --> 22:20.756
…Palma's got charisma.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.175
[Chapo] Yeah…

22:23.884 --> 22:25.719
What you call a "natural leader"…

22:25.802 --> 22:27.304
I fucking heard you, Neto.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.098
Enough.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.351
So maybe now you'll listen.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.481
If Güero Palma's
calling shots for Sinaloa,

22:38.148 --> 22:40.358
what's Mayo need you for?

22:40.442 --> 22:44.946
Get ahead of this, kid -
or get back in line…

22:50.160 --> 22:53.914
-[Palma speaking indistinctly]
-[all laughing]

23:02.672 --> 23:05.300
[indistinct chatter]

23:14.309 --> 23:15.769
[in English] Ordered you a coffee.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.270
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.106
Got my thing?

23:21.858 --> 23:22.692
Any trouble?

23:22.776 --> 23:24.319
You have my thing or no?

23:27.989 --> 23:29.533
Ran that Texas plate for you.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.714
"Edith… Edith Richards."

23:44.798 --> 23:46.967
That's the registered owner.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.426
She's 72.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.014
This is not the car.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.435
This isn't the car.
I told you Cadillac. This is a Dodge.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.937
-Hey.
-This is Dodge.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.605
Hey. That's what came back.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.900
Which means the car you saw
was probably stolen.

24:03.984 --> 24:06.111
Swapped plate. It's pretty common.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.156
Especially if the vehicle's been used
to commit a crime.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.208
-Are you okay, Victor?
-[scoffs]

24:20.292 --> 24:21.293
You eaten?

24:23.003 --> 24:25.714
Are we friends now, Agent Jaime?

24:26.965 --> 24:27.799
[chuckles]

24:30.886 --> 24:31.720
No.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.598
No, I know we're not friends.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.683
[Spanish song playing over speakers]

24:41.563 --> 24:43.273
How long have you been on the job?

24:49.196 --> 24:51.031
Too long. [sighs]

24:52.824 --> 24:54.367
Coming up on my 26th year.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.706
Got a family?

25:01.833 --> 25:02.709
Daughter.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.047
Yeah. She lives
with her mother up in Virginia.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.300
You?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.179
No.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.226
We tried for a while, but…

25:21.144 --> 25:22.020
didn't work.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.445
[pager buzzing]

25:35.492 --> 25:36.743
Everything okay?

25:41.456 --> 25:42.290
Gotta go.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.542
Victor, be careful.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.296
Watch your back.

-[Marta in Spanish] <i>Hey.</i>
-[Amado] It's me.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.864
Of course -

26:16.032 --> 26:17.909
You're the only one with this number.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.246
<i>You there?</i>

26:22.080 --> 26:25.292
Those guys from the security service,
they still outside?

26:29.462 --> 26:30.380
Yes.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.718
Always… My personal bodyguards.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.637
Everything okay?

26:38.847 --> 26:39.848
Look…

26:40.890 --> 26:44.602
Our plan, you leaving…
something's come up.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.695
[Providencio in English] This how it felt

26:53.778 --> 26:55.905
when you were closing in
on Félix Gallardo?

26:58.950 --> 27:00.410
That was bullshit, man.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.788
They gave us Félix.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.882
[Benjamín's wife in Spanish]
Bye. Thank you, doctor.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.385

-[Ruth babbles]
-[nurse sighs]

27:20.722 --> 27:21.598
Thank you.

-Thank you.

have eyes on the girl right now.

Alejandro Ayala tells me you're in charge.

27:46.998 --> 27:47.999
How far out are we?

27:48.083 --> 27:50.627
We should have a visual on the house
by the time we land.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.088
The girl and mother,
they match the description.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.342
Fuckin' A.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.682
[Beltrán in Spanish]
We were making progress,

28:04.766 --> 28:06.017
but shit's getting complicated…

28:06.768 --> 28:07.852
[Chapo] Complicated how?

28:09.354 --> 28:14.984
[Beltrán] Fucking Army,
hit a couple of our spots…

28:15.068 --> 28:17.779
What's Mayo's plan -
get them off our back…

28:18.905 --> 28:20.115
Look…

28:20.198 --> 28:22.492
-[Palma] Didn't know we were meeting.

Gentleman.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.413
Mmm.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.166
Fuck, Arturo…

28:30.875 --> 28:32.752
You look like shit…

28:32.836 --> 28:34.587
Thought I was the one in jail.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.856
How do we fix it?

28:52.939 --> 28:57.902
Reached out to Amado,
help replace the product we lost.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.612
[Palma] Mmm-hmm.

29:00.113 --> 29:00.989
And?

29:01.072 --> 29:02.991
Said he's out.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.952
Fucking guy's scared…

29:08.079 --> 29:11.916
Why don't you tie yourself
to other organizations?

29:13.251 --> 29:14.961
Now we're relying on Amado…

29:19.424 --> 29:22.844
What about my "La Comadre" thing,
it still working?

29:22.927 --> 29:24.763
[Palma laughing]

29:24.846 --> 29:26.473
What, jalapeño cans?

29:26.556 --> 29:28.057
Yeah.

29:29.434 --> 29:34.105
Gotta tell El Léon
you're stealing his ideas… [chuckles]

29:34.189 --> 29:37.317
Thought you said
you came up with that in the cafeteria?

29:39.152 --> 29:40.403
Oh.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.708
What?

29:53.792 --> 29:56.669
Been searching
political events in Monterrey…

29:57.587 --> 29:59.547
anything that might tie to the PRI

29:59.631 --> 30:01.966
around the time
our "beauty queen" was there.

30:02.884 --> 30:03.843
There she is.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.387
And look who else…

30:12.811 --> 30:16.397

[Javi] No. But no one's come or gone
since the girl arrived back.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.075
[Walt] No confirmation on Benjamín.

31:09.158 --> 31:12.328
Wouldn't be that much security
if Benjamín wasn't here.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.789
If it's his wife and kid,
of course there would be.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.712
[Providencio] If we keep sitting here,
we're gonna get made.

31:20.795 --> 31:25.133
We move on the house and he's not inside,
this angle's burned forever.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.220

Okay.

This man.

He knew Hank?

No. Wasn't even a member of the Party.

You sure about this, man?

Staying here, trying to hang onto Juárez
after I'm gone - it's gonna be a fight…

It's life, man.

he was assigned to 6th Infantry Command.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.951
Under General Gutiérrez Rebollo.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.374
[Isaac] They were close.

After Edgar died…

40:27.299 --> 40:29.677
Rebollo maintained a relationship
with Yessenia…

40:31.429 --> 40:32.596
That account…

40:32.680 --> 40:34.098

40:34.181 --> 40:37.017

hasn't been funneling it to Hank…

40:39.353 --> 40:41.355
They've been paying off General Rebollo.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.567
The man running Mexico's war
on drug traffickers…

40:44.650 --> 40:48.696
The payments started
the same month Rebollo arrived in Tijuana.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.952
You two found this?

40:55.953 --> 40:57.204
At the library.

Pinel.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.511
From Mexico City.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.387
And the Federal Prosecutor?

Used to be a cop…

43:09.628 --> 43:10.879
Look, please…

43:10.963 --> 43:14.300
The man driving that car…

43:14.383 --> 43:15.843
He's dangerous.

43:19.555 --> 43:22.099
He hurts women.
