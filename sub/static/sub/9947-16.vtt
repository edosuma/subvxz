00:01.637 --> 00:03.077
Anyone watching,
thinking we know fuck all

00:03.820 --> 00:05.899
about knowing fuck all about owt,

00:05.900 --> 00:08.379
needs to watch their back.

00:08.380 --> 00:11.419
So, you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.420 --> 00:13.179
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.180 --> 00:17.659
literally, literally, taking
the grass from its own roots.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.859
Now you've got your Con-Dem nation,

00:19.860 --> 00:23.259
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:23.260 --> 00:27.899
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.900 --> 00:31.019
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:31.020 --> 00:33.499
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.500 --> 00:36.779
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.179
Well, for fuck's sake,

00:39.180 --> 00:43.979
we live in Manchester
and they charge us for water.

00:43.980 --> 00:48.339
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.340 --> 00:52.219
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:52.220 --> 00:54.259
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:54.260 --> 00:57.419
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.780
This is our England now.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.540
Party!

01:15.060 --> 01:18.059
My Dad used to take me
and our kid to the countryside.

01:18.060 --> 01:19.739
Didn't do owt. We had no money.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.339
Bread didn't have time
to go stale in our house,

01:23.340 --> 01:24.500
so the ducks missed out.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.219
Just sat on the hillside
and watched the clouds go by.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.820
Didn't even talk.

01:35.340 --> 01:37.140
When I got older,
we still weren't talking.

01:37.141 --> 01:41.660
But that's because neither of us
knew what to say anymore.

01:42.860 --> 01:45.220
After a few more years,
that stopped being a problem,

01:45.221 --> 01:49.819
because we couldn't bear to be
in the same house as each other.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.379
To this day I don't know if we fell
out because I hated the man

01:52.380 --> 01:53.740
or because I realised
I was slowly turning into him.

01:53.741 --> 01:56.139
Dad! Dad!
Get your jollies elsewhere.

01:56.140 --> 01:57.218
You dirty fucker.

01:57.219 --> 01:59.340
Dad! She's gushing!
My dad got the last laugh, though.

01:59.341 --> 02:03.299
Cos every now and again, I open
my mouth to speak and he falls out.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.940
Everything he said then, I say now.

02:09.220 --> 02:11.420
Shit.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.419
Dad! Get the fuck out of my house!

02:15.420 --> 02:18.099
Aah! No!

02:18.100 --> 02:20.259
Take your fucking stuff with you!

02:25.620 --> 02:27.979
- Mrs Powell?
- Get out!

02:27.980 --> 02:30.179
Dad! Dad!

02:30.180 --> 02:32.859
I find you sniffing round her again
and I'll cut your fucking...

02:32.860 --> 02:35.979
Jackson!
..cock off.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.739
Mary Twill.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.379
Social worker.

02:40.380 --> 02:44.899
It's about our fostering
application, Jackson.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.459
We'll be ready for you next time.
Won't be abusing any kids.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.019
Yeah, we'll stop putting cigs out
on Letitia.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.819
Not that we smoke. Certainly not
weed.

02:52.820 --> 02:55.779
Or crack.

02:55.780 --> 02:58.979
Look, what happened, that's...

02:58.980 --> 03:02.539
That's not how I normally conduct
myself... we conduct ourselves.

03:02.540 --> 03:06.619
Let's start next time
with a new slate, shall we?

03:06.620 --> 03:09.979
Yeah. Thank you.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.299
Bye. Bye.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.819
Total overreaction, as per.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.699
I caught some dirty little bastard
shagging our daughter.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.219
How else was I supposed to react?

03:19.220 --> 03:21.778
He's not some dirty little bastard.
They've been seeing each other for
weeks.

03:21.779 --> 03:23.538
You knew what they were doing in our
home?

03:23.539 --> 03:26.018
Well, it's better than doing it
in some crack den in Gorton.

03:26.019 --> 03:28.660
Having a boyfriend is a no-no, but
having some fucked-up foster kid in
the house

03:28.661 --> 03:30.659
is all right? Language!

03:30.660 --> 03:32.939
You're only doing it cos you'll get
paid.

03:32.940 --> 03:34.900
I know you might find it hard to
believe,

03:34.901 --> 03:36.299
but paid or unpaid,

03:36.300 --> 03:38.380
some kids would be grateful having
someone give a fuck about them.

03:38.381 --> 03:40.019
Language.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.459
Oi!

03:42.460 --> 03:45.419
Where do you think you're going?
Back in the house!

03:45.420 --> 03:48.139
Avril. Stella's got a temperature.

03:48.140 --> 03:53.499
Er... blue bottle, top shelf, next to
the sink. Two five mils every four
hours.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.059
You're a star.
Ooh, is she asthmatic?

03:56.060 --> 03:58.099
Er... no.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.819
How old are you?
Dad, leave him alone!

04:00.820 --> 04:03.459
17! We were only kissing!

04:03.460 --> 04:07.179
She's 15! That's rape! Do you want
to go on the sex offenders'
register?

04:07.180 --> 04:09.939
And that's assault!
Do you wanna lose your job?

04:09.940 --> 04:11.900
I'm telling the truth! Nothing
happened!

04:11.901 --> 04:14.179
You lay one fucking finger on her,
and I'll...

04:14.180 --> 04:17.139
Oh, fuck. Is this the one, Avril?

04:17.140 --> 04:21.099
That's the one. Lovely lad.

04:21.100 --> 04:25.259
Looking after his little sister.
Chickenpox.

04:25.260 --> 04:27.740
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, you cunt?

04:27.741 --> 04:30.379
Stella's still in there, weeping,
and I don't mean crying!

04:30.380 --> 04:32.979
Chickenpox could finish off
a man of my years.

04:32.980 --> 04:35.539
See you when she's scabbed over.

04:35.540 --> 04:39.699
Right, well, I want you home by 12,
you bastard, and sober!

04:39.700 --> 04:43.099
It's not like this normally.
Everyone's gone mad today.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.899
Must be something in the water.

04:45.900 --> 04:49.620
Avril, I put some ice on Stella's
head and it's stuck.

04:52.820 --> 04:55.899
Am I Coleen Nolan? No.

04:55.900 --> 04:59.179
Can I have a clue?
You're a shit interior designer.

04:59.180 --> 05:01.539
Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.

05:01.540 --> 05:02.339
No.

05:02.340 --> 05:04.179
Your wallpaper's crap.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.899
Would you shut the fuck up?

05:07.900 --> 05:09.738
Right, come on, let's see what
you've got.

05:09.739 --> 05:11.540
Wait, we're going to have to play
for summat else. We're all skint.

05:11.541 --> 05:14.019
Blow jobs. Busman's holiday.

05:14.020 --> 05:16.059
What's the point? I get them anyway.

05:16.060 --> 05:20.259
Right. Whoever wins the hand gets
to choose between truth, dare, kiss,

05:20.260 --> 05:21.739
command or promise.

05:21.740 --> 05:24.699
It's a bit playground.
And you being so fuckin' mature.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.059
Yep? All right.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.140
On my count, one, two, three.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.700
Ah.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.379
Read 'em and weep.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.939
Right. You two kiss.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.100
Oh. Ha-ha.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.499
Right.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.739
Just a little clue.

05:51.740 --> 05:56.339
Irish. Freedom fighter or terrorist,
depending on your politics.

05:56.340 --> 05:59.219
Oh. Louis Walsh?

05:59.220 --> 06:01.819
Daniel O'Donnell.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.899
Dana. Bono.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.899
Val Doonican. The Corrs.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.339
Boyzone!

06:09.340 --> 06:13.459
Home now. I promised Aidan he could
go to the chippy before it shuts.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.939
Can't leave Stella on her own
while she's sick.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.979
Nanny state! You do it!

06:17.980 --> 06:21.179
I'm her brother, not her dad.
And I'm on a promise. Now go! Go!

06:21.180 --> 06:24.179
All right.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.779
Carl!

06:26.780 --> 06:29.139
Aah! Go home!

06:31.620 --> 06:35.059
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

06:35.060 --> 06:38.619
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

06:38.620 --> 06:42.499
♪ Happy birthday, dear Sarah ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear... ♪

06:48.420 --> 06:51.220

06:57.220 --> 06:58.420
You bastards!

07:09.460 --> 07:11.260
Aah!

07:16.900 --> 07:19.219
Stella? I've put her upstairs.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.859
Frank's AWOL. Carl's at work.

07:21.860 --> 07:24.859
Aidan's learning the drums.
Where's Letitia?

07:24.860 --> 07:28.339
Revising round at Dee's.
I said she wasn't to see him again.

07:28.340 --> 07:31.219
Which is the best way
of making her do the exact opposite.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.299
At least this way, we know where she
is.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.700
We don't even know where he lives.
You know they won't be revising!

07:35.701 --> 07:38.259
I knew you'd worry,

07:38.260 --> 07:42.459
so I gave her condoms and asked her
to write the address down.

07:42.460 --> 07:45.019
He's a lovely kid
when you get to know him.

07:45.020 --> 07:48.819
Apart from his name. Africa.
No wonder he calls himself Dee.

07:48.820 --> 07:51.979
He's shagging my underage daughter.
I don't want to fucking know him.

07:51.980 --> 07:54.459
Where are you going?
Where do you think?

07:54.460 --> 07:56.460
Before you start looking after
other people's kids,

07:56.461 --> 07:59.500
you want to try looking after your
own.

08:17.780 --> 08:20.020
Come on! Hey!

08:22.460 --> 08:25.579
We always wanted two kids, didn't
we?

08:25.580 --> 08:28.819
Little boy. A son.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.139
Well, a son of sorts. A foster son.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.979
Might be another girl.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.698
Look, I know how hard this must be
for you

08:37.700 --> 08:40.099
to see your baby growing
into a woman.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.940
But Dee's a great lad.
You should get to know him.

08:46.700 --> 08:50.739
Any chance you could keep Stella
while I finish my shift? I'll pay
you.

08:50.740 --> 08:54.219
I'll put some calamine on her
spots. Cheers.

08:54.220 --> 08:56.659
You talk some sense into him, Carl.

08:56.660 --> 08:59.739
He seems to have forgotten
what it's like to be young.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.060
Must have been the same
when you were their age, Jackson.

09:02.061 --> 09:03.619
That's the trouble. I was.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.939
Jackson, what the fuck you playing
at? Shh, shh.

09:10.940 --> 09:12.419
Letitia's new boyfriend.

09:12.420 --> 09:16.459
New boyfriend, who I found her doing
the dirty with, is probably my son.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.740
A one-night stand with Avril's best
mate.

09:19.741 --> 09:23.459
I knew she was pregnant
but I thought she'd got rid of it.

09:23.460 --> 09:24.980
She told me she was going to get rid
of it.

09:26.540 --> 09:27.660
You've got to tell...

09:27.661 --> 09:30.579
Fuck.

09:30.580 --> 09:34.699
Shagging your sister.
That's like me and our Debbie.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.180
Avril will kill me
when she finds out about this.

09:36.181 --> 09:38.580
So, you're going to keep schtum?

09:40.500 --> 09:44.219
Say nothing and I let my daughter
shag her brother.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.339
Come clean and my marriage is over.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.939
My wife leaves me, taking my
daughter and my testicles with her.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.819
Fuck, Carl.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.219
I was a kid.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.740
A stupid fucking kid.

09:58.220 --> 10:01.260
What do I do?

10:11.140 --> 10:12.299
Don't move.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.659
All right.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.659
I... I had a few drinks
and took some drugs. Sorry.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.539
What sort of man does this?

10:20.540 --> 10:23.339
Well, I might be able to explain
if I knew where I was.

10:23.340 --> 10:26.859
Right now, my synagogue.
Ten minutes' time, a police station.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.939
Next week, hopefully in prison.

10:30.940 --> 10:33.699
The law doesn't tolerate
this sort of behaviour any more.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.459
What sort of... Look, look, look.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.139
Just chillax. Ah! Oh!

10:37.140 --> 10:41.739
I'm on my hands and knees scrubbing
my son's grave day after day,

10:41.740 --> 10:45.539
ridding it of the filth that you and
your sort have daubed all over it.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.139
Oh, no! No. No, no way.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.980
No way on this earth would I...

10:54.900 --> 10:56.499
Look, look.

10:56.500 --> 11:01.259
I am not an antisem... icist.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.739
I... I'm just a stupid drunk
looking for shelter.

11:04.740 --> 11:07.779
You're religious man, obviously.

11:07.780 --> 11:08.820
Show some mercy.

11:08.821 --> 11:11.860
For the Lord's sake.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.780
For my children's sake.

11:17.060 --> 11:19.099
Oh, God!

11:19.100 --> 11:24.979
If I'm incarcerated, I...
I don't know how they'll survive.

11:24.980 --> 11:27.259
Please. Please!

11:27.260 --> 11:29.299
I beg you.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.939
I want to atone.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.460
Let me.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.739
I lived like you,
as fast as I could go.

11:42.740 --> 11:45.699
Drink, women, gambling.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.859
Oh, yeah, I don't do gambling
so much now.

11:47.860 --> 11:50.859
I'd sooner spend the cash
on a dead cert. Booze, you know.

11:50.860 --> 11:55.379
I drew the line at drugs but my
success in business went to my head

11:55.380 --> 11:58.259
and I thought I was invincible,
untouchable.

11:58.260 --> 12:04.139
But God reminded me my sinful life
came with a price tag.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.179
How much?

12:05.180 --> 12:08.939
The most precious thing in my life
was taken from me.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.699
Your car?

12:10.700 --> 12:13.219
Plasma telly? Your iPod thingy?

12:13.220 --> 12:16.020
My son.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.299
Three years ago.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.899
Punishment for the way
I'd lived my life.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.579
Since then, I've done
what I can to atone.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.739
Gave up my job, my life of sin.

12:30.740 --> 12:33.419
Bet your missus
had something to say about that.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.779
She had sense.
She'd left me years previously.

12:35.780 --> 12:40.139
I work in the synagogue,
live as good a life as possible.

12:40.140 --> 12:46.220
I was put there so
you and I should meet.

12:47.460 --> 12:50.139
I lived a godless life
and lost my son.

12:50.140 --> 12:54.740
My redemption is
to help you keep yours.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.740
It's so clear.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.900
Have you got the stuff?

13:09.420 --> 13:11.060
I owe you.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.979
Aled Jones?

13:15.980 --> 13:18.420
Will you stop fucking following me?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.419
Bad news. Chinese Elvis
is doing Burnley.

13:23.420 --> 13:26.339
But they can let us have two
Thai Britneys for the same price.

13:26.340 --> 13:27.500
Tell 'em to fuck off.

13:27.501 --> 13:29.219
What about sacking the act?

13:29.220 --> 13:31.299
Mate of mine could do us
a gold party.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.259
Be a laugh, and people could earn
a few bob off their old jewellery.

13:34.260 --> 13:38.060
Oh, hilarious! An evening of crack
whores and choker chains.

13:40.100 --> 13:43.259
You carry on having a laugh
and leave the entertainment to me.

13:43.260 --> 13:45.260
Right, come on, show your cards.

13:46.180 --> 13:47.499
Ooh!

13:47.500 --> 13:50.299
Oh! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

13:50.300 --> 13:53.299
Come on, girls,
you know the drill. Oh, dear.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.939
Don't you dare say kiss.

13:54.940 --> 13:57.579
All right, all right, command.

13:57.580 --> 13:59.499
I command you two to kiss.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.698
Get on with it.

14:00.699 --> 14:02.740
There's summat weird
about you even asking for this.

14:02.741 --> 14:06.220
Every man's fantasy. Two women.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.139
Hiya, love.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.299
Can I grab a bottle of lager?
Yeah.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.499
I'll get it, Mimi. Two lagers.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.900
Any mate of Letitia's
is a mate of mine.

14:24.060 --> 14:28.139
Right. Let's just get this straight.
I stay here, free of charge?

14:28.140 --> 14:29.899
Food and board.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.099
And what if I say no?

14:32.100 --> 14:35.579
I call the police and tell them
I'd like to report a hate crime.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.780
Oh, come on, it's hardly that.

14:36.781 --> 14:40.220
How else would you describe
vandalising a synagogue?

14:45.660 --> 14:48.299
Erm...

14:48.300 --> 14:51.539
look, I know you were married
and everything,

14:51.540 --> 14:54.139
and forgive me for asking,
cos I have to,

14:54.140 --> 14:59.859
cos marriage excuses no-one
the freak's roll call...

14:59.860 --> 15:07.219
You... you don't bat for the other
side, do you? And I'm not talking
Palestinians.

15:07.220 --> 15:10.619
I see we're going to have to start
from the beginning.

15:10.620 --> 15:15.139
I'm here to help you
but first you're here to help me.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.659
How?

15:16.660 --> 15:20.939
From sundown today until sundown
tomorrow, that's six to six,
is the sabbath.

15:20.940 --> 15:28.059
I'm forbidden to do any work,
which includes giving orders,
making requests.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.459
That's where you come in.

15:30.460 --> 15:36.379
So, for example I might say,
"It's a little chilly in here."

15:36.380 --> 15:39.299
And you'd suggest?

15:39.300 --> 15:42.579
Double glazing?

15:42.580 --> 15:45.500
You'd say,
"I'll put the heating on."

15:47.500 --> 15:51.860
I say, "I'm a little hungry."
You say?

15:53.100 --> 15:55.739
I shall prepare a light snack,
Isaac.

15:55.740 --> 15:59.460
This is gonna work just fine,
my friend.

16:06.420 --> 16:08.779
Come on, Frank, get 'em lit.

16:08.780 --> 16:11.220
Paint me black and call me Benson.

16:20.220 --> 16:23.100
Ah.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.099
This carpet looks dirty.

16:27.100 --> 16:31.019
This carpet looks dirty. You think?

16:31.020 --> 16:33.780
Drink? Yeah, don't mind if I do.

16:37.060 --> 16:40.259
I'm a little peckish. You say?

16:40.260 --> 16:43.819
Mine's a double voddie,
easy on the tonic.

16:43.820 --> 16:49.179
Now I say, "It's Friday night,
I'm parched." And you say?

16:49.180 --> 16:53.179
Hello, police? I'd like you to
arrest this man for crimes
against humanity.

16:54.660 --> 17:00.580
No. No, well, strictly speaking,
it should be me calling the filth.

17:02.460 --> 17:06.060
Kidnap and blackmail was still
illegal, last time I checked.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.260
Can't believe
you'd do this to your own kid.

17:11.261 --> 17:13.979
It's for my other kid, for Letitia.

17:13.980 --> 17:17.459
Are you sure he's yours?
She might have been with other men.

17:17.460 --> 17:20.539
No, it was me she had in her sights.
Everyone knew it.

17:20.540 --> 17:25.259
Used to knock back fellas left,
right and centre. Keeping herself
free for me.

17:25.260 --> 17:27.220
Her words, not mine.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.620
He's a really nice lad.

17:29.621 --> 17:31.179
So Avril keeps telling me.

17:31.180 --> 17:34.979
Works two jobs as well as school.
If it wasn't incest, it'd be
perfect.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.059
Don't, Carl.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.699
Fuck.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.020
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

17:43.100 --> 17:46.779
You'll do what we agreed, yeah?
Please.

17:46.780 --> 17:49.340
We'll have Stella
for the next three nights.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.660
Deal.

17:56.380 --> 17:58.940
Can tell he's yours.
Can't handle his ale.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.499
You do know I'm straight?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.059
Need to be where we're going,
fella.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.099
Am I dreaming?

18:12.100 --> 18:13.140
Wide awake, kid.

18:13.141 --> 18:15.099
Well, almost.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.619
Oh, I can't feel my knees.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.899
Try concentrating
on another part of your anatomy.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.179
You smell like toothpaste.

18:22.180 --> 18:25.580
That's the second nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.659
I can't get up.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.940
Well, that's why you pay
a professional.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.339
Leave it to me, cocker.

18:35.340 --> 18:39.539
Let Kelly... work her magic.

18:39.540 --> 18:43.059
No, I can't get up.
Can't feel my legs.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.819
Lift your arm. I can't.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.979
I can't!

18:47.980 --> 18:49.939
Oh, I want to see my girlfriend!

18:49.940 --> 18:53.819
I don't think
she'd want to see you in this state.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.859
I need to see Letitia!

18:55.860 --> 18:58.979
Letitia? Powell?

18:58.980 --> 19:01.819
Bloody brain, Carl!

19:01.820 --> 19:04.258
I wouldn't tell you
if I didn't care for Letitia.

19:04.259 --> 19:05.100
I saw him going in there
off his tits.

19:05.101 --> 19:09.699
This one belong to you?
Found him passed out in Lillian's.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.619
Lillian's?

19:11.620 --> 19:13.900
You dirty bastard!

19:14.700 --> 19:16.579
No offence, Kelly.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.779
None taken.

19:17.780 --> 19:21.579
You better stay away from my
daughter from now on, you hear me?

19:21.580 --> 19:26.059
Hey, no. No. You've got
the wrong end of the doodah.

19:26.060 --> 19:30.699
Poor sod walked in, saw Trixie
and the girls hosting a naughty
NHS night

19:30.700 --> 19:32.420
and thought he were at
the dentist's.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.499
He kept asking for a root canal
and crying for Letitia.

19:36.500 --> 19:40.900
Well, that's how I knew to bring him
here. I think someone spiked him.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.300
I've got a punter waiting.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.739
He's in no fit state to get home.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.779
I'll take him.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.419
If we're quick,
we'll catch the last bus.

20:12.860 --> 20:14.779
Alyah.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.020
Well, well, well.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.699
You're a very bad man, Frank.

20:34.700 --> 20:38.420
I see now, clearer than ever.

20:39.660 --> 20:42.539
You have to be stopped.

20:42.540 --> 20:46.179
Tell your dad to stop being a cunt
and find us another drink.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.539
What did you say?
Joke.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.419
Put... that...

20:51.420 --> 20:52.499
down!

20:52.500 --> 20:55.899
Hey, look! I know that you miss him
and all that,

20:55.900 --> 20:58.499
but in lots of ways
you're lucky he's died.

20:58.500 --> 21:02.859
He... he'd have only grown into
a twat like mine did.

21:02.860 --> 21:06.179
Come on! Don't go all
Austrian dad on us!

21:06.180 --> 21:07.100
Let us out, eh?

21:07.101 --> 21:08.739
I would love to, Frank.

21:08.740 --> 21:13.339
But, as you know, I'm not supposed
to do anything on the Sabbath.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.899
So, you sleep it off
and we'll sort you out tomorrow.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.500
Once and for all.

21:24.940 --> 21:28.299
You told me you weren't
keeping the baby.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.900
You told me you'd love me forever.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.539
So, what you been up to?

21:35.540 --> 21:37.899
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.700
I've got a son now.
He's shagging his sister.

21:39.701 --> 21:42.499
She's only his half sister.
They're not breaking the law.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.779
Yes, they are. No, they're not.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.420
Your name's not on
the birth certificate.

21:46.421 --> 21:49.979
Whose is? Mr T.

21:49.980 --> 21:53.859
They're still blood. I can't believe
you knew about this and you let it
carry on.

21:53.860 --> 21:55.780
Oi, calm down. You'll wake him up.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.420
What are we gonna do?

22:01.540 --> 22:05.740
I looked at him tonight.
He's so fuckin' beautiful,
it made me wanna cry.

22:07.740 --> 22:10.739
I wanna be part of his life,
but I can't do that to Avril.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.859
It'd kill her.
It's not all about her.

22:12.860 --> 22:17.420
She hates your guts,
and you've given me the
one thing that she couldn't.

22:21.060 --> 22:23.020
We'll sort it.

22:24.580 --> 22:27.459
We've got to split them up.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.900
That way,
you can still be part of his life.

22:32.300 --> 22:35.059
Avril won't find out.

22:35.060 --> 22:38.819
Be our little secret.
You're a teacher.

22:38.820 --> 22:42.619
We'll tell Dee you're part
of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme,
help him get into university.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.739
And splitting them up?

22:44.740 --> 22:48.540
I'll just tell him to look at the
mother. That should put him off.

22:49.820 --> 22:51.740
Why didn't you tell me
you'd kept it?

22:51.741 --> 22:54.779
Him. Cos it were none
of your fucking business.

22:54.780 --> 22:57.460
Pretty clear where
you stood back then.

22:59.340 --> 23:01.300
She didn't deserve you.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.780
We'd have been good, me and you.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.420
And our son.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.420
Me and you were a mistake.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.539
You might as well have another.
Last bus has long gone.

23:26.540 --> 23:29.500
And we've got a lot of catching up
to do, haven't we?

23:46.100 --> 23:47.780
Morning, Daddy.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.299
What'll it be like round here
with another kid under our feet?

24:22.300 --> 24:24.219
It'll be great.

24:24.220 --> 24:28.859
You better get changed. The social
worker will be here any minute.

24:28.860 --> 24:31.340
Dunno if I'm past
my nappy-changing days.

24:43.140 --> 24:48.379
So, what exactly did you say you did
last night, when you took Dee back?

24:48.380 --> 24:49.779
What did his mum say?

24:49.780 --> 24:53.379
Just thanks. Thanks very much.

24:53.380 --> 24:55.059
Nice kid, though. Isn't he?

24:55.060 --> 24:56.339
Lovely, yeah.

24:56.340 --> 24:58.419
Gentle kid. Intelligent.

24:58.420 --> 25:01.899
Sensitive. Bit of a looker, too.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.619
His dad in, you said?

25:04.620 --> 25:08.579
Yeah. We just took him straight
upstairs, then threw him into bed.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.900
Then me on the two-seater.
Hardly slept a wink.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.579
Dad!

25:36.580 --> 25:38.620
Dad, over here!

25:42.180 --> 25:43.099
Son!

25:43.100 --> 25:45.179
Yeah, I know.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.339
Goatees are so 2005.

25:47.340 --> 25:48.459
You OK?

25:48.460 --> 25:51.299
Oh! Ah!

25:51.300 --> 25:53.780
You get used to it.

25:55.140 --> 25:58.219
You go and enjoy yourself.
You've earned it.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.460
What about Stella?

25:59.461 --> 26:03.899
Close to death due to complications
with chicken pox, but in good hands.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.579
You go and have a good time.

26:05.580 --> 26:09.500
Hey, check some of them coats.
Might just get lucky.

26:27.980 --> 26:31.219
Isaac. Can you let me out, please?

26:31.220 --> 26:33.140
I really need the toilet.

26:35.740 --> 26:37.419
Cheers.

26:37.420 --> 26:40.260
Am I Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mitch and Tich?

26:41.860 --> 26:43.339
God loves a trier.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.019
What about a gold party?

26:46.020 --> 26:46.819
What?

26:46.820 --> 26:48.899
A theme night.
We'll do a gold party.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.179
Nice one.

26:50.180 --> 26:53.499
God, there must be an echo in here,
because I said that yesterday.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.860
No need to pull your face.

26:54.861 --> 26:56.899
If you don't like it, just say.

26:56.900 --> 26:57.939
I do like it.

26:57.940 --> 26:59.859
What's your problem?

26:59.860 --> 27:02.940
You don't half
get yourself wound up over nothing.

27:04.220 --> 27:05.380
Have you had your tablets today?

27:05.381 --> 27:07.579
Hey!

27:07.580 --> 27:09.099
What's up with you?

27:09.100 --> 27:11.940
I was... Nothing.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.420
Kelly! Have you claimed
your prize yet?

27:18.700 --> 27:19.979
Fuck's sake.

27:19.980 --> 27:21.499
We asked for this.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.619
What's up with you?

27:23.620 --> 27:26.220
I think Jackson
might be having an affair...

27:27.300 --> 27:29.739
with a 17-year-old boy.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.379
You need to cut down
on the sherbets.

27:32.380 --> 27:35.619
No chance.
I can spot 'em a mile off, Avril.

27:41.700 --> 27:44.260
Eurgh, you dirty bastards!

27:46.420 --> 27:48.980
See! They're all at it!

28:05.660 --> 28:09.419
What the fuck? You've had
my daughter! Had my husband!

28:09.420 --> 28:10.700
Do you wanna go for your hat trick?

28:10.701 --> 28:12.219
How could you think I'd...

28:12.220 --> 28:15.499
Look me in my eyes, and tell me
you've not slept with him.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.099
I haven't! I swear!

28:17.100 --> 28:21.059
Then who the fuck wrote that
on your back? Huh?

28:21.060 --> 28:23.219
It wasn't him.

28:23.220 --> 28:24.620
It was me.

28:28.260 --> 28:28.860
Last night?

28:28.861 --> 28:32.419
No, not last night!
Nothing happened last night!

28:32.420 --> 28:34.860
Is that true?

28:39.580 --> 28:41.500
Then what the fuck's this all about?

28:42.540 --> 28:46.540
Just something I had to tell you.
Dee's his son.

28:49.860 --> 28:52.859
Isaac?

28:52.860 --> 28:57.379
I'm sorry I locked you in last
night, but you had to be punished.

28:57.380 --> 28:59.780
The way you talked about your
children broke my heart.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.179
You haven't seen 'em.

29:01.180 --> 29:04.660
And you should count
your lucky stars you still can.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.459
I am the victim here.

29:09.460 --> 29:14.299
Oh, for once in your life,
tell the truth!

29:14.300 --> 29:18.580
Atone for your sins,
while you still have time!

29:19.900 --> 29:23.979
Because there's no time
left for me, Frank!

29:23.980 --> 29:26.739
And I can't take it any more!

29:26.740 --> 29:29.139
I can't!

29:29.140 --> 29:31.939
Fucking hell! What?

29:31.940 --> 29:33.340
Why?!

29:34.740 --> 29:38.539
Couldn't you have taken me
instead of him?

29:38.540 --> 29:44.179
The sins of the father
are visited on the children, Frank,

29:44.180 --> 29:47.459
and he's punishing me,

29:47.460 --> 29:49.219
but I need it to stop!

29:49.220 --> 29:50.260
What was his name?

29:56.860 --> 29:58.019
His name.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.059
Daniel.

29:59.060 --> 30:02.219
Daniel. What happened to Daniel,

30:02.220 --> 30:06.059
I don't think had much
to do with God.

30:06.060 --> 30:07.739
You don't understand.

30:07.740 --> 30:14.659
Oh! Just apply a little logic,
right?

30:14.660 --> 30:21.779
All the fucking nutters out there
who have fathered sons, right,

30:21.780 --> 30:24.339
and have done despicable things,

30:24.340 --> 30:26.499
you know, Stalin, Mussolini,

30:26.500 --> 30:29.299
Thatcher, Blair...
I don't mean Lionel.

30:29.300 --> 30:33.779
Their kids weren't smited,
were they?

30:33.780 --> 30:35.299
Struck down?

30:35.300 --> 30:36.459
I sinned.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.939
No.

30:38.940 --> 30:41.059
Fucking hell!

30:41.060 --> 30:43.459
No, I've sinned!

30:43.460 --> 30:46.779
Drugs. Drink.

30:46.780 --> 30:50.339
Sex. Neglect.

30:50.340 --> 30:54.700
I've thought about no-one but me...

30:56.460 --> 30:58.659
and I don't think I ever will.

30:58.660 --> 31:01.460
Don't think I ever want to.

31:02.580 --> 31:06.579
So, if anyone deserved
a good smiting, it's me.

31:06.580 --> 31:09.459
Don't arouse his anger, Frank.

31:09.460 --> 31:13.100
Ooh. Well, come on, do your worst!

31:15.620 --> 31:19.580
But give this poor bastard a break,
will you?

31:23.660 --> 31:25.979
Whoa. Whoa.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.980
It wasn't your fault.

31:41.141 --> 31:42.339
Oh, come here.

31:42.340 --> 31:45.260
Hey. It's all right.

31:53.300 --> 31:54.420
I think we need some time
to ourselves.

31:54.421 --> 31:56.499
I want her here.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.019
Independent observer.

31:58.020 --> 32:00.459
Innocent bystander,
if it gets rough.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.459
I just want to...

32:02.460 --> 32:05.459
Yellow card!
You no speaky, you listen.

32:05.460 --> 32:07.300
Comprende?

32:15.620 --> 32:18.060
You've always made me feel loved.

32:19.260 --> 32:22.699
And because of that,
I can forgive you anything.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.459
We'll get over this.

32:24.460 --> 32:25.819
But that's what I was...

32:25.820 --> 32:27.300
Shut it.
You're not off the hook yet.

32:27.301 --> 32:29.619
You could have come clean.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.619
You could have told me

32:31.620 --> 32:33.779
and made all that shit
I put you through,

32:33.780 --> 32:36.739
with the credit cards
and the debt, balance out.

32:36.740 --> 32:39.419
But, no.

32:39.420 --> 32:43.219
All the time you were
wagging your finger at me,

32:43.220 --> 32:45.619
you had your own
dirty little secrets.

32:45.620 --> 32:49.780
That's what kills me.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.179
I never meant to hurt you.
I'm sorry.

32:54.180 --> 32:57.099
The first thing I knew
about Dee being mine

32:57.100 --> 33:00.539
was when I clocked Alyah was his mam
and did some maths.

33:00.540 --> 33:03.019
I could never have kept him
a secret from you.

33:03.020 --> 33:05.219
You have to believe that.

33:05.220 --> 33:08.140
And I'm truly, truly sorry.

33:11.100 --> 33:13.539
I'll send our kid for my stuff.

33:13.540 --> 33:17.699
You don't get to walk away
after causing all this shit!

33:17.700 --> 33:22.100
I tell you to fuck off if this
isn't working out. Which it will.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.340
Thanks, Kelly.

33:27.500 --> 33:31.699
I'll take Stella.
You owe me a drink.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.620
You owe me a lot of drinks. Lots.

33:37.740 --> 33:40.419
Lip, he's a great dad.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.499
I've even got one
with ginger hair too.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.699
Actually,
he is fuck all to do with me.

33:44.700 --> 33:45.980
But what I'm saying is

33:45.981 --> 33:48.939
that you can't take the blame
or the glory

33:48.940 --> 33:52.259
for your children's
successes or failures.

33:52.260 --> 33:58.819
But you could be at home sharing
those successes and failures.

33:58.820 --> 34:01.419
And ginger's a recessive gene,
by the way.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.700
You're a decent man, Isaac.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.938
I might not know my arse
from my elbow most of the time,

34:11.940 --> 34:15.739
but I've got good antennae
when it comes to human nature.

34:15.739 --> 34:17.739
You're a good man. Wait.

34:21.900 --> 34:27.099
This isn't much,
but it might help ease your burden.

34:27.100 --> 34:30.579
If you're not worrying
about putting food on the table,

34:30.580 --> 34:34.940
maybe it'll give you the time
to rediscover and enjoy...

34:42.900 --> 34:45.300
what's important.

34:52.020 --> 34:54.539
Can I play drums at the reception?

34:54.540 --> 34:57.580
My drums. Can I play 'em
at Letitia's wedding reception?

35:04.140 --> 35:06.500
Leave yous to it.
You've got a lot to discuss.

35:16.540 --> 35:19.579
You light a cigarette on a candle,
a sailor dies.

35:19.580 --> 35:23.019
Oh, well, my vote's
Captain Birdseye, then.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.499
He got younger and his face changed.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.379
Mimi, another.

35:27.380 --> 35:29.900
Face, or pint? Money.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.059
This'll do. £60 quid?

35:33.060 --> 35:35.059
It's worth ten times more than that.

35:35.060 --> 35:36.498
You know it and I know it.

35:36.499 --> 35:37.938
How dare you call me a cheat?

35:37.939 --> 35:38.540
Lend us a tenner, Carl.

35:38.541 --> 35:40.459
Fuck off.

35:40.460 --> 35:44.019
Ill buy you one. And then Ill sell
this tomorrow and well all be rich.

35:44.020 --> 35:44.700
Clue, Mimi?

35:44.701 --> 35:46.779
You're a lying twat.

35:46.780 --> 35:48.740
Nick Clegg.

35:50.100 --> 35:53.739
You are so fuckin' cheating!

35:53.740 --> 35:55.739
Look, I cant do this much longer,
Dad. Huh?

35:55.740 --> 35:58.179
Look after a kid,
run the house, cook, clean.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.379
It was different
when we was all at home.

36:00.380 --> 36:03.220
Yeah, talk anon.
Just going for a quick gypsy's.

36:04.860 --> 36:08.659
You, me. Rematch tonight.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.619
Should learn when to walk away.

36:10.620 --> 36:14.460
Don't you want to win your dignity
back? Come on, Jamie.

36:15.820 --> 36:18.899
Don't come crying to me
when you're lip-locked with Lillian.

36:18.900 --> 36:22.940
All right, and don't you back down
at paying up when you lose.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.779
Swear. I want your word.

36:25.780 --> 36:28.379
All right, you've got it.

36:28.380 --> 36:29.939
Carl!
Stella! Quick!

36:29.940 --> 36:31.819
What's happened? What's wrong?

36:31.820 --> 36:33.418
Don't panic.
We've got to get her to hospital.

36:33.419 --> 36:35.060
Ambulance is here.
We have to go now.

36:35.061 --> 36:38.139
I'll tell your dad.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.740
Frank, Stella's on the way to the...

36:39.741 --> 36:41.738
Hospital. I know.
I heard it first time.

36:41.739 --> 36:43.060
Best place for her, then.

36:43.061 --> 36:44.379
You're not going?

36:44.380 --> 36:46.139
She's poxed up. I could catch it.

36:46.140 --> 36:47.980
Then I'd be no use to anyone,
would I?

36:47.981 --> 36:52.500
And we couldn't have that, could we?

36:56.660 --> 37:00.339
Straight to voice mail. They can't
get married. They're too young.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.660
They're brother and sister.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.739
You're not invited.

37:07.740 --> 37:08.740
To the wedding
that won't be allowed to happen?

37:08.741 --> 37:12.619
See, I don't want my son
being born out of wedlock.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.060
Yee-ha!

37:17.220 --> 37:19.499
You can't keep it.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.820
My mam said that'd be the first
thing that came out your mouth.

37:21.821 --> 37:23.979
Dee. I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you...

37:23.980 --> 37:25.420
Implying I've missed out on
something?

37:25.421 --> 37:28.459
I've done fine without you,
thanks very much.

37:28.460 --> 37:30.699
Straight As, and I've got
uni on the horizon.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.299
I don't smoke, take drugs...

37:32.300 --> 37:35.819
Oh, unless I get spiked
by my biological father, of course.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.779
I was trying to protect you.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.659
You were denying my existence.

37:39.660 --> 37:40.298
No.

37:40.299 --> 37:42.218
If anything had happened
between me and Kelly,

37:42.219 --> 37:44.540
you'd have told Letitia
and she'd have binned me.

37:44.541 --> 37:47.580
Wouldn't you?

37:51.380 --> 37:53.819
You'd have allowed me
to walk out your life.

37:53.820 --> 37:58.619
Never said a word to Tish.
Or her mum. Wouldn't you?

37:58.620 --> 38:01.380
You're not sorry you
was never there for me.
You're just sorry you found me.

38:01.381 --> 38:03.179
Don't say that.

38:03.180 --> 38:05.859
I'm sorry you found me.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.140
Look at what's happened
since you did.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.499
That poor kid.

38:11.500 --> 38:15.739
She's pregnant
and were gonna look after it!

38:15.740 --> 38:16.980
I'm not pregnant.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.459
Then why lie?

38:20.460 --> 38:23.340
That's rich coming from you.

38:24.900 --> 38:26.699
We haven't even slept together.

38:26.700 --> 38:27.820
But I saw you two sha...

38:27.821 --> 38:30.900
Kissing. You saw us kissing.

38:31.980 --> 38:34.219
I did tell you.

38:34.220 --> 38:37.340
You need to get your mind
out of the gutter, Mr Powell.

38:55.940 --> 38:58.499
See you round, yeah?

38:58.500 --> 39:00.980
Hope so. Never had a brother before.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.700
Dee?

39:11.820 --> 39:13.700
You're welcome round here any time.

39:17.820 --> 39:23.700
Thanks. Don't think that would do
anyone much good, though, do you?

39:43.660 --> 39:47.779
I'll put you in the hospital
if you don't go and see how
your daughter is!

39:47.780 --> 39:50.179
Carl's rang four times!

39:50.180 --> 39:54.419
All right. But I hope you're aware
of the risk I'm running.

39:54.420 --> 39:57.139
Could finish me off if I'm infected.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.459
We can but hope.

39:59.460 --> 40:02.020
This gold party's
a great idea of yours.

40:07.940 --> 40:11.539
I'm not kissing Frank.
I'm not inserting anything.

40:11.540 --> 40:14.299
I'm not doing any shit with melons.

40:14.300 --> 40:16.300
Apart from that, do your worst.

40:17.620 --> 40:20.979
Looks like I'm kissing my mam or you.

40:20.980 --> 40:24.619
True, dare, kiss, command.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.620
And promise.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.419
Is it true

40:32.420 --> 40:35.539
that you like it when I do this?

40:35.540 --> 40:38.339
Mm-hm.

40:38.340 --> 40:40.060
I dare you...

40:41.940 --> 40:43.940
to unzip.

40:45.940 --> 40:47.459
Mam.

40:47.460 --> 40:50.260
Maguire word count
for nothing, then?

40:59.700 --> 41:01.539
Now.

41:01.540 --> 41:04.260
Kiss.

41:07.380 --> 41:09.619
Are you ready for your command?

41:09.620 --> 41:11.700
Mm-hm.

41:12.940 --> 41:16.179
I command you, give me my pub back.

41:16.180 --> 41:17.939
What?

41:17.940 --> 41:20.340
Sign back the right of attorney that
you took from me when I was ill.

41:20.341 --> 41:22.059
Go away.

41:22.060 --> 41:24.259
Bad enough that you stole it
in the first place.

41:24.260 --> 41:26.579
A fucking outrage
that you kept hold of it,

41:26.580 --> 41:30.859
forcing me to resort
to this stupid fucking game
to even get you to talk about it.

41:30.860 --> 41:31.860
What... what does it matter?

41:31.861 --> 41:35.259
You gave your word.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.019
The pub is mine...

41:37.020 --> 41:40.020
and until you swear
you'll return it...

41:45.660 --> 41:48.180
you ain't getting
your bollocks back.

41:52.380 --> 41:53.860
Stella.

41:54.940 --> 41:55.979
Stell...

41:58.180 --> 42:00.660
Stella.

42:05.620 --> 42:08.299
Stella. Can you hear me?

42:08.300 --> 42:10.259
Get him away from the kids.

42:10.260 --> 42:13.139
No, I...
I'm just trying to see my daughter!

42:13.140 --> 42:15.379
Stella Gallagher.

42:15.380 --> 42:19.419
Just... All right! Just... just
tell me that she's OK, yeah?

42:19.420 --> 42:21.620
You're too late, she's gone.

42:23.620 --> 42:26.260
She only had chickenpox!

42:29.300 --> 42:34.139
The sins of the father
are visited on the children, Frank!

42:34.140 --> 42:40.619
The sins of the father
are visited on the children, Frank!

42:42.380 --> 42:44.860
I'm sorry.

42:46.460 --> 42:49.060
I'm sorry.

43:03.060 --> 43:03.980
Where the fuck were you?

43:03.981 --> 43:06.219
I know. I know.

43:06.220 --> 43:09.019
If I could turn back the clock...

43:09.020 --> 43:10.939
Oh, fuck off.

43:10.940 --> 43:12.339
Oh!

43:12.340 --> 43:15.419
You're a selfish
self-centred piece of shit.

43:15.420 --> 43:18.459
All you do, all you've ever done,
is fuck people over,

43:18.460 --> 43:21.859
your family, your own kids.

43:21.860 --> 43:24.980
I needed you. Stella needed you.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.339
I've had it, Dad. I've had it.

43:30.340 --> 43:33.019
You know if...
if I could turn back the clock

43:33.020 --> 43:36.859
and do a deal with God
to put it right,

43:36.860 --> 43:37.939
I would!

43:37.940 --> 43:41.779
You been on the gin? Always like
this when he's been on the gin.

43:41.780 --> 43:45.139
A sentimental maudlin twat.

43:45.140 --> 43:47.019
It's God's judgment.

43:47.020 --> 43:53.659
My penance for my sins is to live
with her death on my conscience,

43:53.660 --> 43:56.620
until the day
I'm called to answer for it.

44:00.220 --> 44:03.660
And that's right. All your fault.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.460
Don't know how you live with
yourself.

44:12.620 --> 44:15.740
Fuck's sake, Stella.
We had him on the ropes, then.

44:17.900 --> 44:20.779
She's alive? Stella's alive?

44:20.780 --> 44:25.179
Temperature spiked. She had a fit.
Doctor said she's fine now.

44:29.860 --> 44:32.180
She's alive!

44:35.340 --> 44:39.139
She's alive!

44:39.140 --> 44:41.059
She's...

44:41.060 --> 44:43.819
A mate of mine said
I should write my dad a letter.

44:43.820 --> 44:47.619
Sort all the shit out before he died.
Cos if I didn't, I'd regret it.

44:47.620 --> 44:51.539
Not long after,
I passed my dad in the street.

44:51.540 --> 44:55.219
For less than a second,
we looked at each other.

44:55.220 --> 44:58.499
Then we both looked away
like we were complete strangers.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.539
He'd let me go.

45:00.540 --> 45:04.899
When you have your own,
you realise how hard that is.

45:04.900 --> 45:08.219
I know now that every shitty comment
or put-down my dad made

45:08.220 --> 45:10.299
was cos he loved me.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.099
He couldn't help himself,

45:12.100 --> 45:15.459
cos he was terrified
I'd fuck my life up like he had.

45:15.460 --> 45:17.499
But it don't make it right,

45:17.500 --> 45:19.739
cos that's the same excuse
those nutters make

45:19.740 --> 45:22.219
who kill their kids
before topping themselves.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.979
"I did it because I loved 'em."

45:24.980 --> 45:26.899
If you're that fucked up,

45:26.900 --> 45:29.499
do em a favour
and get out of the way.

45:29.500 --> 45:32.699
Cos as hard as it is,
if you wanna be part of their lives,

45:32.700 --> 45:34.099
you've got one option.

45:34.100 --> 45:39.140
That's to stand on the sidelines,
and cheer them on.

45:50.580 --> 45:53.939
Where there is darkness,
I shall bring the light.

45:53.940 --> 45:55.780
Jesus is doing no harm.

45:59.580 --> 46:00.579
Marty?!

46:00.580 --> 46:04.019
Not like some perv's buying
you a plant as a thank you
for trying to fuck you.

46:04.020 --> 46:05.979
Wasn't a perv, it was Marty.

46:05.980 --> 46:07.259
It's an orgy!

46:07.260 --> 46:11.219
I've got more buying. I couldn't
get a punter past the God squad.

46:11.220 --> 46:12.980
Got another poster?
It's just for college.

46:12.981 --> 46:14.659
What do we do?

46:14.660 --> 46:16.379
Go round there and we nail 'em.

46:16.380 --> 46:17.459
Kill Jesus?

46:17.460 --> 46:19.179
I can't call that off.

46:19.180 --> 46:24.140
You can't call it off, but I can!

46:29.420 --> 46:34.760
