WEBVTT

00:08.087 --> 00:09.953
Passing outer planet Zeon.

00:10.023 --> 00:11.991
We want the inner one,
Ekos.

00:12.059 --> 00:14.493
Plot a standard orbit
and take us in.

00:14.561 --> 00:15.493
Aye, sir.

00:15.562 --> 00:17.325
Lieutenant Uhura,
raise John Gill ...

00:17.397 --> 00:18.830
on Starfleet communications.

00:18.899 --> 00:20.161
Aye, aye, sir.

00:20.233 --> 00:22.497
Starfleet's been trying
for six months.

00:22.569 --> 00:25.003
Isn't it unlikely
he'd receive us now?

00:25.072 --> 00:26.505
I don't know, Bones.

00:26.573 --> 00:29.508
We're here to find out
what's happened.

00:29.576 --> 00:31.009
I never met John Gill,

00:31.078 --> 00:33.512
but I studied Earth history
from his textbook.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.172
I knew him very well.

00:35.248 --> 00:36.977
He was my instructor.

00:37.050 --> 00:40.349
What impressed me most was
his treatment of Earth History ...

00:40.420 --> 00:43.355
as causes and motivations
rather than dates and events.

00:43.423 --> 00:44.822
Captain,

00:44.891 --> 00:46.756
no response
on any channel.

00:46.827 --> 00:49.193
Spacecraft approaching
from inner planet.

00:51.264 --> 00:52.424
From Ekos?

00:52.499 --> 00:55.434
Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship.

00:55.502 --> 00:58.938
The Zeons do have
a crude interplanetary capability.

00:59.005 --> 01:00.563
Reaction powered ...

01:00.640 --> 01:02.631
a small rocket --

01:02.709 --> 01:05.940
It is on an intercept course.

01:07.514 --> 01:10.483
That would mean it has
sophisticated detection devices ...

01:10.550 --> 01:13.986
which neither Zeon
nor Ekos should have.

01:14.054 --> 01:15.544
Have you raised anyone,
Lieutenant?

01:15.622 --> 01:16.554
Nothing, sir.

01:16.623 --> 01:18.488
Captain, it's an unmanned probe ...

01:18.558 --> 01:21.823
which seems to be
carrying a warhead.

01:24.898 --> 01:26.263
Stand by, phasers.

01:28.268 --> 01:29.428
[ Chekov ]
Phasers ready.

01:29.503 --> 01:31.334
Range, Mr. Chekov?

01:31.405 --> 01:32.963
2,000 kilometers.

01:33.039 --> 01:34.904
Closing fast.

01:36.777 --> 01:38.108
Fire.

01:44.351 --> 01:45.648
Fascinating.

01:45.719 --> 01:47.687
A thermonuclear warhead.

01:47.754 --> 01:51.053
That's generations ahead of where
these people should be technically.

01:51.124 --> 01:52.682
How did they manage that?

01:52.759 --> 01:54.090
Maybe they had help.

02:06.540 --> 02:09.633
[Captain Kirk]
Space. The final frontier.

02:15.549 --> 02:19.986
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise,

02:20.053 --> 02:23.989
its five-year mission --
to explore strange new worlds,

02:24.057 --> 02:27.993
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:28.061 --> 02:31.428
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

03:12.172 --> 03:13.104
Maximum orbit.

03:13.173 --> 03:15.471
Take us out of
their detection range.

03:15.542 --> 03:16.600
Most interesting.

03:16.676 --> 03:19.338
We were attacked by
a thermonuclear missile ...

03:19.412 --> 03:22.506
from a planet which
should have no such weapon.

03:22.582 --> 03:24.140
Orbit computed and locked in.

03:24.217 --> 03:25.411
Execute.

03:25.485 --> 03:28.545
Captain, no response
from John Gill on any channel.

03:28.622 --> 03:30.146
He must be dead.

03:30.223 --> 03:31.656
And what's going on ...

03:31.725 --> 03:33.625
down there on Ekos?

03:33.693 --> 03:34.990
According to our records,

03:35.061 --> 03:37.359
the Ekosians are
a primitive, warlike people ...

03:37.430 --> 03:38.863
in a state of anarchy.

03:38.932 --> 03:42.026
The other planet, Zeon, has
a relatively high technology,

03:42.102 --> 03:43.763
and its people are peaceful.

03:43.837 --> 03:46.362
We've run into
a far more serious problem ...

03:46.439 --> 03:48.873
than the disappearance
of John Gill.

03:48.942 --> 03:50.375
Spock, we'll beam down.

03:50.443 --> 03:52.877
Bones, one precaution.

03:52.946 --> 03:55.380
Prepare a subcutaneous
transponder ...

03:55.448 --> 03:58.645
in the event we can't
use our communicators.

03:58.718 --> 04:00.515
Insert the transponder, Doctor.

04:08.495 --> 04:12.158
Make one low pass
to communication range in three hours.

04:12.232 --> 04:14.496
If we fail to make contact,

04:14.568 --> 04:17.833
take our coordinates from
the transponder and beam us aboard,

04:17.904 --> 04:20.168
no matter what
our condition may be.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.174
Aye, sir.
Whatever your condition.

04:22.242 --> 04:23.174
You ready?

04:23.243 --> 04:24.175
Ready, Captain.

04:28.715 --> 04:29.841
Energize.

04:41.094 --> 04:42.527
The Ekosians are humanoid,

04:42.596 --> 04:46.362
so there is apt to be
a similarity in architecture.

04:46.433 --> 04:47.457
Interesting.

04:55.709 --> 04:56.869
[ Grunts ]

04:56.943 --> 04:57.967

On your feet, pig.

Captain,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.331
the Noninterference Directive.

05:22.402 --> 05:24.666
Hold your hands
above your head, Zeon.

05:24.738 --> 05:26.000
Higher.

05:26.072 --> 05:30.008
Keep your hands up so you don't
touch anything Ekosian.

05:30.076 --> 05:32.510
You've defiled us
for the last time.

05:32.579 --> 05:34.171
That's now ended.
Move!

05:40.587 --> 05:42.521
Unbelievable.

05:42.589 --> 05:44.853
Do you recognize those uniforms?

05:44.924 --> 05:46.357
Mid-20th century Earth.

05:46.426 --> 05:49.190
The nation state called
Nazi Germany.

05:49.262 --> 05:50.695
[Man On P.A.]
Attention.

05:50.764 --> 05:52.755
Attention.

05:52.832 --> 05:55.164
Attention.

05:55.235 --> 05:57.066
An announcement from
Fuhrer Headquarters.

05:57.137 --> 05:59.867
Today, the Fuhrer has ordered
our glorious capital ...

05:59.939 --> 06:01.964
to be made Zeon-free.

06:02.042 --> 06:04.636
Our heroic troops
have begun flushing out ...

06:04.711 --> 06:07.441
the Zeon monsters
who've been poisoning our planet.

06:07.514 --> 06:09.311
How could this have happened?

06:09.382 --> 06:11.145
The chances of another planet ...

06:11.217 --> 06:13.651
developing a culture
like Nazi Germany,

06:13.720 --> 06:16.154
using the forms,
the symbols, the uniforms ...

06:16.222 --> 06:19.157
of 20th century Earth
are so fantastically slim.

06:19.225 --> 06:20.658
Virtually impossible, Captain,

06:20.727 --> 06:24.823
yet the evidence is quite clear.

06:24.898 --> 06:28.834
The Fuhrer's headquarters reports
repulsing an attack by Zeon spacecraft.

06:28.902 --> 06:32.133
Our missiles utterly
destroyed the enemy.

06:32.205 --> 06:33.672
You look quite well ...

06:33.740 --> 06:38.234
for a man who's been
utterly destroyed, Mr. Spock.

06:38.311 --> 06:40.336
Zieg heil!

06:40.413 --> 06:42.176
Zieg heil!

06:42.248 --> 06:44.512
At this patriotic demonstration,

06:44.584 --> 06:47.519
Deputy Fuhrer Melakon presented
the Iron Cross, second class ...

06:47.587 --> 06:50.522
to Daras, hero of the Fatherland.

Everywhere,
preparations go forward ...

06:53.660 --> 06:56.356
toward the Final Decision --

06:56.429 --> 06:58.522
Death to Zeon.

06:58.598 --> 07:00.793
Long live the Fatherland.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.528
Long live the Fuhrer.

That's John Gill.

07:08.041 --> 07:08.973

07:09.042 --> 07:09.974
Fascinating.

07:10.043 --> 07:12.511
You, Zeons!

07:20.220 --> 07:23.656
What kind of monsters are
the Zeons sending against us?

07:23.723 --> 07:26.317
You're right.
He's not one of us.

07:26.392 --> 07:27.654
Look at him.

07:30.063 --> 07:31.655
Spock, take his uniform.

07:31.731 --> 07:34.165
You propose
we pass ourselves off as Nazis?

07:34.234 --> 07:35.826
If John Gill's the Fuhrer,

07:35.902 --> 07:37.836
it would seem
the logical approach.

07:37.904 --> 07:39.838
That's very well taken,
Captain.

07:54.420 --> 07:57.514
That helmet covers
a multitude of sins.

Lieutenant,

08:00.593 --> 08:02.959
what have we here?

08:05.698 --> 08:06.630
A Zeon?

08:06.699 --> 08:08.792
Obviously he's not one of us.

08:08.868 --> 08:10.130
I captured him.

08:10.203 --> 08:11.795
Is that not correct procedure ...

08:11.871 --> 08:13.304
with enemies of the Fatherland?

08:13.373 --> 08:14.965
With all Zeon pigs, Lieutenant.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.303
Take charge of him.

08:16.376 --> 08:17.434
With pleasure.

08:17.510 --> 08:20.638
Today we have a surprise
planned for you, Zeon.

08:25.051 --> 08:26.313
Your uniform, Captain.

08:26.386 --> 08:28.650
It's a shame yours
isn't as attractive.

08:28.721 --> 08:29.745
Gestapo, huh?

08:29.823 --> 08:30.847
Quite correct.

08:30.924 --> 08:34.485
You should make
a very convincing Nazi.

08:44.070 --> 08:45.230

08:46.406 --> 08:48.840
Have you forgotten
how to salute?

08:52.579 --> 08:53.841
Your orders, Lieutenant.

08:53.913 --> 08:56.347
He wants the orders
in your jacket.

08:56.416 --> 08:58.145
The Lieutenant's a little dazed.

08:58.218 --> 09:00.413
He captured several Zeons
single-handed.

09:00.486 --> 09:03.250
One struck him
before he dropped.

09:03.323 --> 09:07.657

to remember, Major.

with the Fuhrer.

09:37.523 --> 09:38.854

09:38.925 --> 09:40.358
remove your helmet.

10:13.726 --> 10:14.658
Enough.

10:21.601 --> 10:24.035
Do you wish
to speak now?

10:30.944 --> 10:32.878
Tell me your orders!

10:32.946 --> 10:35.039
You were sent to kill
our Fuhrer. Confess!

10:35.114 --> 10:36.376
You want more persuasion?

10:36.449 --> 10:38.713
You're making this a rather
one-sided conversation.

10:38.785 --> 10:41.720
Do not joke with me, Zeon pig.

10:44.624 --> 10:46.353
Who is this alien?

10:46.426 --> 10:47.791
Things might go easier ...

10:47.860 --> 10:49.555
if you tell me about him.

10:49.629 --> 10:53.065
I'll tell your Fuhrer everything
he wants to know.

10:53.132 --> 10:56.898
You'll be glad to talk to me
before I'm through.

10:56.970 --> 10:58.232

10:58.304 --> 10:59.896
Ah, Chairman Eneg.

11:02.742 --> 11:05.336
Your Excellency,
I am honored.

11:05.411 --> 11:07.174
I've been interrogating
these spies,

11:07.246 --> 11:08.178

11:08.247 --> 11:10.181
I've had a full report.

11:19.092 --> 11:22.027
You are not from Zeon.

11:22.095 --> 11:23.585
Obviously.

11:24.931 --> 11:27.229
Where do you come from?

11:27.300 --> 11:30.030
I'll explain when
I see the Fuhrer.

11:30.103 --> 11:32.037
What's your business
with the Fuhrer?

11:32.105 --> 11:33.367
I'll tell only him.

11:33.439 --> 11:34.463
Pig!

11:34.540 --> 11:36.201
You're speaking
to the Party Chairman.

11:36.275 --> 11:37.708
That's enough, Major.

11:43.282 --> 11:46.046
What were the weapons
found on you?

11:46.119 --> 11:47.279
What design?

11:49.956 --> 11:52.447
Our famous SS laboratories
have been ...

11:52.525 --> 11:55.050
unable to discover
how the weapons work.

11:55.128 --> 11:58.393

a few minutes with them.

11:58.464 --> 11:59.556
I promise you, I'll --

11:59.632 --> 12:02.829
You had a few minutes,
without result.

12:02.902 --> 12:04.836
The trouble with you SS ...

12:04.904 --> 12:06.838
is that you don't realize ...

12:06.906 --> 12:10.842
that punishment becomes
ineffective after a certain point.

12:10.910 --> 12:12.844
Men become ...

12:12.912 --> 12:14.675
insensitive.

12:14.747 --> 12:16.009
Yes, Excellency.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.345
Lock them up.

12:18.418 --> 12:20.682
Let their pain
argue with them,

12:20.753 --> 12:22.186
then I'll question them.

12:22.255 --> 12:23.847
Excellency,
the standing order ...

12:23.923 --> 12:25.857
is to interrogate and execute.

12:25.925 --> 12:27.859
The interrogation
is finished, therefore --

12:27.927 --> 12:29.019
Finished?

12:29.095 --> 12:31.359
What have you learned?

12:31.431 --> 12:33.023
Hold them for an hour.

12:33.099 --> 12:34.361
Excellency, the order --

12:34.434 --> 12:36.527
That is my order, Major.

12:36.602 --> 12:39.867
I suggest you do not disobey it.

12:39.939 --> 12:41.372
Yes, Excellency.

12:44.243 --> 12:46.211
All right, pigs.

12:46.279 --> 12:48.713
I shall keep my eye
on the clock.

12:48.781 --> 12:50.578
When the hour is up,

12:50.650 --> 12:54.051
you will die most unpleasantly,
I promise you!

12:56.289 --> 12:57.688
Lock them up.

13:04.397 --> 13:07.332
John Gill was the kindest,

13:07.400 --> 13:09.334
gentlest man I ever knew.

For him to be a Nazi --

13:12.071 --> 13:13.003
[ Groans ]

13:13.072 --> 13:14.403

13:25.751 --> 13:27.343
You're not a Zeon.

13:27.420 --> 13:29.854
He certainly is not one.

13:29.922 --> 13:32.083
Why do the Nazis
treat you as enemies?

13:32.158 --> 13:34.524
Why do the Nazis hate Zeons?

13:36.262 --> 13:37.854
Why?

13:37.930 --> 13:39.693
Because without us to hate,

13:39.765 --> 13:42.859
there'd be nothing
to hold them together.

13:42.935 --> 13:46.371
So the Party has built us
into a threat,

13:46.439 --> 13:48.532
a disease to be wiped out.

13:48.608 --> 13:52.374
Is Zeon a threat to them?

13:52.445 --> 13:55.039
Where did you come from?

13:55.114 --> 13:58.049
Our warlike period ended
dozens of generations ago.

13:58.117 --> 13:59.379
We came here.

13:59.452 --> 14:02.478
We thought we were
civilizing the Ekosians.

14:02.555 --> 14:05.319
It would seem
the assumption was premature.

14:05.391 --> 14:07.586
Were they like this
when you first came?

14:07.660 --> 14:09.651
Warlike, yes, but not vicious.

14:09.729 --> 14:12.323
That started when
the Nazi movement began --

14:12.398 --> 14:13.990
only a few years ago.

14:14.066 --> 14:18.230
That would coincide with
the time of John Gill's arrival.

14:18.304 --> 14:20.238
When they've destroyed us here,

14:20.306 --> 14:21.830
they will attack our planet ...

14:21.908 --> 14:24.172
with the technology
we gave them.

14:24.243 --> 14:28.339
The danger is that taking life
is so repugnant to our people,

14:28.414 --> 14:30.780
I'm afraid we'll go down
without a struggle.

14:32.418 --> 14:34.852
But after what I saw
in the street today,

14:34.921 --> 14:37.014
I think I could kill.

14:42.094 --> 14:44.858
Do you know the plan
of this building?

14:44.931 --> 14:45.989
Why?

14:46.065 --> 14:48.431
If we can get to
the SS weapons laboratory --

14:48.501 --> 14:49.866
get our weapons back --

14:49.936 --> 14:51.801
maybe we can
stop the slaughter.

14:51.871 --> 14:54.431
Why should you be interested
in saving Zeons?

14:55.942 --> 14:58.877
We must get our communicators,
contact the ship.

14:58.945 --> 15:02.642
Captain, the flaw in the plan
is this locked door,

15:02.715 --> 15:04.376
and the guard beyond it.

15:04.450 --> 15:07.977
To the logical mind,
the outlook is somewhat gloomy.

15:13.559 --> 15:14.787
The transponders.

15:14.860 --> 15:15.952
Yes.

15:18.397 --> 15:22.663
And a way to shed some light
on the gloom, Mr. Spock.

15:22.735 --> 15:23.827
Of course.

15:23.903 --> 15:27.566
The rubindium crystals
in the transponders.

15:52.965 --> 15:55.900
Are - Are you trying
to kill yourselves?

16:11.217 --> 16:12.479
I know it's there.

16:12.551 --> 16:14.451
McCoy put it in.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.646
There.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.156
Do you have
the figures computed?

16:20.226 --> 16:21.523
Yes.

16:21.594 --> 16:24.654
The crystals must be held rigidly
at a specific distance,

16:24.730 --> 16:30.498
which I believe
should be 27.2 mm.

16:30.569 --> 16:36.474
27.2 mm would be,
approximately,

16:36.542 --> 16:37.531
there.

16:37.610 --> 16:40.101
That is, of course,
a crude estimation.

16:40.179 --> 16:41.510
What is it you're making,

16:41.580 --> 16:42.774
some kind of radio?

16:42.848 --> 16:44.338
No, not a radio.

16:44.417 --> 16:47.386
The power from
this light is very low.

16:47.453 --> 16:50.854
To reach it, I shall require
some sort of platform.

16:50.923 --> 16:53.858
I would be honored, Mr. Spock.

16:53.926 --> 16:58.363
Now, the rubindium crystals
should find enough power here ...

16:58.431 --> 17:02.800
to achieve the necessary stimulus.

17:02.868 --> 17:05.803
As I recall from
the history of physics,

17:05.871 --> 17:09.807
the ancient lasers
were able to achieve ...

17:09.875 --> 17:11.308
the necessary excitation,

17:11.377 --> 17:13.971
even using crude natural crystals.

17:14.046 --> 17:15.308
Oh, Mr. Spock,

17:15.381 --> 17:18.281
the guard did
a professional job on my back.

17:18.351 --> 17:19.282
Please hurry.

17:19.352 --> 17:20.819
Yes, of course, Captain.

17:22.054 --> 17:25.114
You realize that
the aim will be very crude.

17:25.191 --> 17:26.317
I ...

17:26.392 --> 17:30.328
don't care if you hit
the broad side of a barn.

17:30.396 --> 17:31.522
Just hurry.

17:31.597 --> 17:36.159
Captain, why should
I aim at such a structure?

17:36.235 --> 17:37.668
Never mind, Spock.

17:37.737 --> 17:39.432
Get on with the job.

17:59.258 --> 18:00.589
Oh, my goodness.

18:09.702 --> 18:10.794
Beautiful.

18:10.870 --> 18:12.098
Oh, Spock --

18:12.171 --> 18:13.160
Spock!

18:15.374 --> 18:16.306
Beautiful.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.307
Over there.

18:17.376 --> 18:18.809
I'll create a commotion.

18:18.878 --> 18:19.810
Help!

18:19.879 --> 18:21.312
Help! I'll talk!

18:21.380 --> 18:22.540
I'll talk!

18:22.615 --> 18:25.049
I can't stand it anymore!
I'll talk!

18:25.117 --> 18:26.049
Guard!

18:26.118 --> 18:27.847
Guard, I'll talk!

18:27.920 --> 18:28.852
[Door Opens]

18:28.921 --> 18:30.821
Guard, I'll talk.

18:30.890 --> 18:31.982
I'll talk.

18:32.057 --> 18:33.149
The pain --

18:38.564 --> 18:39.997
Take me with you.

18:40.065 --> 18:42.499
Give me a chance to fight them.

18:42.568 --> 18:44.229
We didn't intend to fight.

18:44.303 --> 18:48.239
Take me with you, or you'll
never find the laboratory.

18:49.575 --> 18:52.009
Take him with us, Mr. Spock.

18:52.077 --> 18:53.510
He's got a point.

18:53.579 --> 18:55.012
He's our guide.

19:06.358 --> 19:08.292
Which is the laboratory door?

19:08.360 --> 19:10.225
The end of the hall.

19:22.775 --> 19:23.969
[Door Closes]

19:26.579 --> 19:28.513
All right, Zeon pigs, move.

19:32.051 --> 19:32.983
Ohh.

19:33.052 --> 19:33.984
Zeon pig.

19:34.053 --> 19:35.486
They do nothing right.

19:35.554 --> 19:36.486
Don't worry.

19:36.555 --> 19:37.988
They're on their way ...

19:38.057 --> 19:39.490
to the laboratory,

19:39.558 --> 19:40.991
for experimental work.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.493
They'll pay. Move!

19:51.904 --> 19:52.836
Move! Move!

19:54.807 --> 19:56.240
Cover the door.

20:06.418 --> 20:07.851
Here they are --

20:07.920 --> 20:09.353
The communicators, disassembled.

20:09.421 --> 20:11.355
Can you get one to work?

20:11.423 --> 20:12.355
Possibly.

20:12.424 --> 20:13.857
Who are you people?

20:13.926 --> 20:14.858
The phasers?

20:14.927 --> 20:16.861
I do not see them.

20:16.929 --> 20:18.863
Where do you come from?

20:31.911 --> 20:33.344
The alien pistols ...

20:33.412 --> 20:36.347
have been sent to
Gestapo Command Headquarters.

20:36.415 --> 20:39.350
Well, that takes care
of the phasers.

20:49.461 --> 20:51.395
You Zeons, for peaceful people,

20:51.463 --> 20:52.896
are pretty thorough.

20:52.965 --> 20:53.897
Yes.

20:53.966 --> 20:55.399
With this uniform,

20:55.467 --> 20:58.402
we can steal a car,
get out of the capital.

20:58.470 --> 21:00.131
We came for John Gill.

21:00.205 --> 21:01.638
Captain, without phasers,

21:01.707 --> 21:04.073
and until we're able to
communicate with the ship,

21:04.143 --> 21:07.078
it is illogical to assume
that we can hold out ...

21:07.146 --> 21:09.580
against the entire military force
of this planet.

21:09.648 --> 21:11.081
All right, Mr. Spock.

21:11.150 --> 21:12.583
You've made your point.

21:12.651 --> 21:15.745
Get into the uniform
and hide those ears again.

21:17.423 --> 21:18.355
Hunting's good.

21:18.424 --> 21:20.358
We've caught so many Zeons,

21:20.426 --> 21:22.860
we've got to
dump them outside.

21:55.961 --> 21:58.225
Who's with you?

21:58.297 --> 21:59.730
Davod, it's all right.

21:59.798 --> 22:02.164
They helped me escape
from the prison.

22:02.234 --> 22:03.667
I owe them my life.

22:03.736 --> 22:05.670
Isak, what is all this?

22:05.738 --> 22:06.670
Abrom --

22:06.739 --> 22:08.673
Abrom, thank God you're well.

22:10.909 --> 22:12.342
This is my brother.

22:12.411 --> 22:15.346
They were in the prison,
beaten as I was, Abrom.

22:15.414 --> 22:17.109
Why were you in prison?

22:17.182 --> 22:18.706
Trying to see the Fuhrer.

22:18.784 --> 22:20.342
The Fuhrer?

22:20.419 --> 22:21.909
If I can see him,

22:21.987 --> 22:26.287
there maybe a way
of stopping this insanity.

22:26.358 --> 22:28.792
Abrom, I owe them my life.

22:32.765 --> 22:33.857
Isak,

22:36.602 --> 22:37.864
Uletta ...

22:37.936 --> 22:39.528
is dead.

22:39.605 --> 22:41.539
Shot down in the streets.

22:53.118 --> 22:55.712
Sh - She would've been my wife.

22:59.958 --> 23:01.892
She lived for five hours ...

23:03.562 --> 23:05.496
while they walked past her ...

23:07.232 --> 23:08.665
and spat on her.

23:11.136 --> 23:15.072
Our own people
were unable to help her.

23:15.140 --> 23:17.335
Now you ask me to ...

23:17.409 --> 23:18.842
help strangers.

23:25.751 --> 23:30.518
If we adopt the ways of the Nazis,

23:30.589 --> 23:33.023
we're as bad as the Nazis.

23:35.494 --> 23:37.519
Captain ...

23:37.596 --> 23:40.531
I suggest the most profitable
use of our time ...

23:40.599 --> 23:44.763
would be to reassemble
our communicators.

23:44.837 --> 23:47.328
May I work undisturbed somewhere?

23:51.110 --> 23:52.042
This way.

23:59.084 --> 24:01.018
By using parts from both,

24:01.086 --> 24:02.451
I've completed
one communicator.

24:02.521 --> 24:05.456
I do not know if
the circuits are correct, Captain.

24:05.524 --> 24:07.458
There's no way to test it,

24:07.526 --> 24:09.289
except in actual use.

24:09.361 --> 24:12.797
The Enterprise won't be
within range for another hour.

24:15.901 --> 24:16.833
Over there.

24:16.902 --> 24:18.836
Against the wall, all of you.

24:18.904 --> 24:21.338
The girl on the view screen
receiving a medal.

24:21.406 --> 24:22.338
Daras.

24:22.407 --> 24:23.396
Quiet.

24:23.475 --> 24:26.706
Hands in the air, Zeon swine.

24:26.779 --> 24:28.474
So you're the three ...

24:28.547 --> 24:30.481
who escaped from
the detention center.

24:30.549 --> 24:33.382
What was your plan? Speak.
It's your last chance.

24:33.452 --> 24:35.852
I must see the Fuhrer.

24:35.921 --> 24:36.853
It's urgent.

24:36.922 --> 24:38.890
Urgent?

24:38.957 --> 24:40.390
I'll bet it is.

24:40.459 --> 24:43.394
I alone am responsible
for what happens here.

24:44.563 --> 24:47.498
Do you know what we do
to responsible Zeons?

24:55.507 --> 24:57.441
Now we finish the job.

25:11.824 --> 25:12.791
Stop, Nazis.

25:12.858 --> 25:15.224
After you've killed
the last of us off,

25:15.294 --> 25:17.694
what do you do, turn
the guns against yourselves?

25:17.763 --> 25:18.787
Don't shoot.

25:18.864 --> 25:20.024
Don't shoot, please.

25:20.098 --> 25:21.827
No, wait.

25:23.068 --> 25:24.660
No more.

25:24.736 --> 25:27.204
You've proved they're on our side.

25:27.272 --> 25:28.637
Now, please forgive us,

25:28.707 --> 25:30.641
but we had to be
absolutely certain.

25:30.709 --> 25:33.109
If we'd taken you
into our confidence,

25:33.178 --> 25:35.078
we could've betrayed
all our people --

25:35.147 --> 25:37.513
if you'd been Nazi spies.
Leave us.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.017
The Gestapo methods
are frighteningly efficient.

25:40.085 --> 25:41.746
We must be very careful ...

25:41.820 --> 25:44.482
in order to survive here.

25:44.556 --> 25:47.855
We of the Underground
don't know who our leaders are.

25:47.926 --> 25:49.325
If we break under pressure,

25:49.394 --> 25:51.453
we'll only betray
a handful of our people.

25:51.530 --> 25:52.963
This young lady's a Nazi,

25:53.031 --> 25:54.464
a hero of the Fatherland.

25:54.533 --> 25:55.966
We saw her being decorated.

25:56.034 --> 25:58.332
I'm an Ekosian,
fighting the terrible thing ...

25:58.403 --> 26:00.030
that's happened to my people.

26:00.105 --> 26:02.039
The decoration was for betraying ...

26:02.107 --> 26:04.541
my own father to the Party.

26:07.312 --> 26:09.246
It was my father's idea.

26:09.314 --> 26:12.750
He used to be
very close to the Fuhrer.

26:12.818 --> 26:14.752
Then he saw the changes ...

26:14.820 --> 26:16.253
and where they were leading.

26:16.321 --> 26:17.720
He turned against the Party.

26:17.789 --> 26:20.189
They imprisoned him.
Melakon sentenced him to death.

26:20.259 --> 26:22.227
Melakon?

26:22.294 --> 26:24.455
The Deputy Fuhrer.
He's taken over.

26:24.529 --> 26:25.689
My father denounced me,

26:25.764 --> 26:27.664
making it appear
like I'd betrayed him.

26:27.733 --> 26:30.293
He gave me a weapon
to continue the fight with.

26:30.369 --> 26:33.031
How could this have seemed
right to John Gill?

26:33.105 --> 26:34.834
Who?

26:34.907 --> 26:36.306
John Gill, your Fuhrer.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.774
He's one of our people.

26:37.843 --> 26:39.242
And what is "your people" ? 

26:44.549 --> 26:46.016
I'm Captain James Kirk ...

26:46.084 --> 26:48.245
of the United Spaceship Enterprise.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.753
This is Mr. Spock.

26:49.821 --> 26:51.311
John Gill, your Fuhrer,

26:51.390 --> 26:53.153
was sent here
by the Federation ...

26:53.225 --> 26:54.988
as a cultural observer.

26:58.730 --> 27:03.167
You mean that
the Fuhrer is an alien?

27:03.235 --> 27:04.759
[ Spock ]
That is correct.

27:10.309 --> 27:12.743
I grew up to admire him,

27:12.811 --> 27:16.247
later to hate and despise
everything he stands for.

27:16.315 --> 27:17.942
But I always thought ...

27:18.016 --> 27:19.745
he was one of us.

27:19.818 --> 27:22.218
To hear he's an alien
sent to destroy us --

27:22.287 --> 27:24.721
That was not his mission, ever.

27:24.790 --> 27:28.226
He was sent here to observe,
not to interfere.

27:28.293 --> 27:29.726
Something went wrong,

27:29.795 --> 27:31.228
and that's why we're here,

27:31.296 --> 27:33.526
to find out and to correct.

27:33.598 --> 27:35.031
We must see him.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.032
It's impossible.

27:36.101 --> 27:38.535
Even if this were another time,

27:38.603 --> 27:40.036
it still would be impossible.

27:40.105 --> 27:42.096
He sees no one but Melakon.

27:42.174 --> 27:44.005
He's under maximum security.

27:44.076 --> 27:45.475
Maximum security?

27:47.045 --> 27:48.478
Is he so afraid?

27:48.547 --> 27:50.412
There are many of us --

27:50.482 --> 27:51.881
Ekosians and younger Zeons --

27:51.950 --> 27:53.383
who'd gladly kill him.

27:53.452 --> 27:56.319
I don't understand
what's going on here.

27:56.388 --> 27:57.787
This goes against
every principle ...

27:57.856 --> 27:59.255
John Gill ever believed in.

27:59.324 --> 28:01.724
Our only chance is to see him,

28:01.793 --> 28:02.987
and quickly.

28:03.061 --> 28:05.928
He makes a speech tonight
from the Chancellery.

28:05.998 --> 28:09.695
All the top Party officials
will be there.

28:09.768 --> 28:11.395
Will you be there?

28:11.470 --> 28:12.767
Of course,

28:12.838 --> 28:16.740
as a symbol of the proper attitude
toward the Fatherland.

28:16.808 --> 28:18.742
As an honored Party member,

28:18.810 --> 28:21.472
she could get us past the guards.

28:21.546 --> 28:24.447
Only the top, most trusted
officials will be allowed in.

28:24.516 --> 28:26.848
The country will watch
on the view screens.

28:26.918 --> 28:30.752
I'm afraid it will be a formal
declaration of war against Zeon,

28:30.822 --> 28:32.221
their Final Solution.

28:32.290 --> 28:33.814
You must get us in there.

28:33.892 --> 28:35.587
It would be suicide.

28:35.660 --> 28:38.595
If the Captain believes
he has a chance,

28:38.663 --> 28:41.188
I'm willing
to commit suicide with him.

28:41.266 --> 28:42.699
You, a Zeon?

28:42.768 --> 28:45.601
You expect to get
into the Chancellery?

28:47.205 --> 28:49.605
It's even more my fight than yours.

28:59.951 --> 29:01.851
What is your business here?

29:01.920 --> 29:04.286
Get me some lights on her.

29:06.224 --> 29:07.782
It's Party Secretary Daras.

29:09.995 --> 29:11.929
The Fuhrer's
Special Documentary Corps.

29:11.997 --> 29:12.929
Smile, Corporal.

29:12.998 --> 29:14.158
Excuse me.

29:22.140 --> 29:24.074
Captain, I'm beginning
to understand ...

29:24.142 --> 29:26.076
why you Earthmen
enjoy gambling.

29:26.144 --> 29:29.671
No matter how carefully
one computes the odds of success,

29:29.748 --> 29:32.512
there's still a certain
exhilaration in the risk.

29:32.584 --> 29:35.485
Very good.
We may make a human of you yet.

29:35.554 --> 29:37.317
I hope not.

29:37.389 --> 29:38.515
Let's go.

29:44.362 --> 29:45.294
Lights.

29:46.932 --> 29:48.957
Thank you.

29:49.034 --> 29:50.968
Where does the Fuhrer enter?

29:51.036 --> 29:51.968
He doesn't.

29:52.037 --> 29:54.972
They watch him on the big screen ...

29:55.040 --> 29:58.032
there, at the end of the room.

29:58.110 --> 30:00.601
He broadcasts from the booth,
for security.

30:00.679 --> 30:01.771
Hmm.

30:01.847 --> 30:04.509
They've got the booth curtained off.

30:07.919 --> 30:11.582
Bring that light
to the side of her face.

30:11.656 --> 30:14.090
Where's the entrance
to the broadcast booth?

30:14.159 --> 30:16.855
There, at the end
of the corridor.

30:19.865 --> 30:22.834
You're not going to try to get into
the broadcast booth.

30:22.901 --> 30:24.835
We're going to try.

30:24.903 --> 30:27.337
This light could be
a little higher.

30:27.405 --> 30:28.337
Good.

30:28.406 --> 30:29.839
If you distract the guard,

30:29.908 --> 30:32.809
I can get a machine gun
and shoot through the door.

30:32.878 --> 30:35.813
We're here to get
John Gill alive,

30:35.881 --> 30:37.906
not for your
personal satisfaction.

30:37.983 --> 30:39.416
Let's try down there.

30:41.853 --> 30:43.286
Lights, please.

30:43.355 --> 30:45.289
This is for the record ...

30:45.357 --> 30:46.824
of the Fuhrer's
Final Solution speech.

30:46.892 --> 30:49.486
[Daras] We're documenting
the men responsible for --

30:49.561 --> 30:51.392

Smile, gentlemen.

30:51.463 --> 30:53.795
There will be
more coverage later.

30:53.865 --> 30:56.265
Let's get a shot down the hall.

30:59.638 --> 31:01.629
So, what have we accomplished?

31:01.706 --> 31:03.537
You should have
let me shoot them.

31:03.608 --> 31:05.542
Captain, it was John Gill,

31:05.610 --> 31:08.010
but he never moved,
never once looked up.

31:08.079 --> 31:11.947
Yes. That may be part of the plan,
the semi divine detachment.

31:12.017 --> 31:13.644
Or a deep psychosis.

31:13.718 --> 31:16.152
He may be drugged.
We need McCoy.

31:16.221 --> 31:19.088
Is there a place
we can be alone?

31:19.157 --> 31:21.057
I'm going to send for help.

31:21.126 --> 31:22.093
Send for --

31:22.160 --> 31:24.594
This takes too long to explain.

31:24.663 --> 31:26.756
Any place will do.

31:26.831 --> 31:28.822
The cloak room?

31:30.902 --> 31:33.336
It may not have the range it had.

31:33.405 --> 31:35.873
In fact, it may not
work at all.

31:35.941 --> 31:37.568
Think positively, Spock.

Come in, Enterprise.

31:47.385 --> 31:49.353
Enterprise. Lieutenant Uhura.

31:50.956 --> 31:52.890
Captain here.
Put McCoy on.

31:52.958 --> 31:54.084
Yes, sir.

31:54.159 --> 31:56.093
Captain, we're not
reading you well.

31:56.161 --> 31:58.789
You're nine points into
the low-frequency band.

31:58.863 --> 32:00.296
We've having difficulty.

32:00.365 --> 32:02.799
Patch historical computer
into uniform section.

32:02.867 --> 32:05.734
I want McCoy outfitted
as a Gestapo doctor --

32:05.804 --> 32:08.170

Old Earth date 1944.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.639
Make him a colonel.

32:09.708 --> 32:10.640
Yes, sir.

32:10.709 --> 32:12.267
Search the building.

32:27.926 --> 32:29.393
[McCoy]
What have you got?

32:29.461 --> 32:30.894
We found John Gill.

32:30.962 --> 32:33.396
He may be drugged,
hypnotized, or psychotic.

32:33.465 --> 32:34.898
You'll have to make
a determination.

32:34.966 --> 32:36.399
Hurry with that uniform.

32:37.469 --> 32:38.800
What is it?

32:38.870 --> 32:41.304
Isak just heard
two security men.

32:41.373 --> 32:43.102
They picked up your broadcast.

32:43.174 --> 32:44.573
They're starting to search.

32:44.643 --> 32:46.042
If there's going to be a delay ...

32:46.111 --> 32:47.305
in transporting the doctor,

32:47.379 --> 32:48.778
I suggest we cancel --

32:48.847 --> 32:50.337

What's happening there?

32:50.415 --> 32:53.213
Dr. McCoy's having difficulty
with that uniform.

32:53.285 --> 32:55.776
Send him naked
if you have to. Kirk out.

32:57.422 --> 32:58.354
It's true.

32:58.423 --> 33:01.256
I only half-believed
what you said.

33:10.602 --> 33:13.002
Computer made a mistake
in the measurements.

33:13.071 --> 33:14.470
The right boot's too tight.

33:14.539 --> 33:16.973
There's a logical way to proceed.

33:17.042 --> 33:18.976
Point your toe,
apply equal pressure ...

33:19.044 --> 33:21.478
to either side of the boot,
and push.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.480
There's no time for emotionalism.

This is Dr. McCoy,

the Colonel is drunk.

33:57.148 --> 33:59.548
He's had a little too much
to drink.

33:59.617 --> 34:01.608
I see.

34:01.686 --> 34:03.381
He thought
he'd embarrass the Fuhrer.

34:03.455 --> 34:06.583
Yes. A doctor
should have more pride.

34:06.658 --> 34:08.523
You were right
to conceal him.

34:08.592 --> 34:11.061
There's a spy in this building

38:20.945 --> 38:22.344
If you can't, Bones,

38:22.413 --> 38:25.541
you'll have to use
a stronger stimulant,

38:25.617 --> 38:27.016
no matter what it does.

38:28.319 --> 38:31.755
Our space fleet is
on its way toward Zeon,

38:31.823 --> 38:33.814
both manned
and unmanned weapons.

38:41.366 --> 38:45.769
This is the time of destiny.

Hail victory!

- Hail victory!

38:53.244 --> 38:54.677
There's one chance left.

38:54.746 --> 38:57.180
If you'd use
the weapons you have,

38:57.248 --> 38:59.113
you could destroy the fleet.

38:59.183 --> 39:01.777
That would kill thousands
of Ekosian spacemen.

39:01.853 --> 39:04.720
Many of my friends
are aboard that ship,

39:04.789 --> 39:06.347
many of the Underground.

39:06.424 --> 39:08.255
Yes, but against
those thousands ...

39:08.326 --> 39:10.226
are millions
of innocent Zeon lives.

39:10.294 --> 39:11.693
You've got to choose ...

39:11.763 --> 39:13.196
the lesser of two evils.

39:16.467 --> 39:17.900
We could save Zeon,

39:20.004 --> 39:21.437
but what about Ekos?

39:21.506 --> 39:22.700
Captain.

39:27.178 --> 39:28.611
I've created a condition ...

39:28.680 --> 39:32.047
in which Gill cannot initiate
speech, or any other action,

39:32.116 --> 39:34.016
but he can reply to questions.

39:34.085 --> 39:35.814
Well done, Spock.

They've kept what's left of him
as a figure head.

39:41.793 --> 39:44.227
Quite correct.
For the last few years,

39:44.295 --> 39:46.024
the real power
has been Melakon.

Gill.

39:53.438 --> 39:55.838
Gill, why did you
abandon your mission?

39:55.907 --> 39:58.637
Why did you interfere
with this culture?

40:03.915 --> 40:05.883
Planet ...

Took lesson from Earth history.

40:14.559 --> 40:15.992
Why Nazi Germany?

40:16.060 --> 40:19.393
You studied history.
You knew what the Nazis were.

40:19.464 --> 40:23.025
Most efficient state ...

40:23.101 --> 40:24.568
Earth ever knew.

40:24.635 --> 40:26.068
Quite true, captain.

40:26.137 --> 40:28.571
That tiny country --
beaten, bankrupt, defeated,

40:28.639 --> 40:31.403

40:31.476 --> 40:33.967
only one step away
from global domination.

But it was brutal, perverted,

at a terrible cost.

40:38.449 --> 40:39.882
Why that example?

40:39.951 --> 40:44.388
Perhaps Gill felt that
such a state, run benignly,

40:44.455 --> 40:46.946
could accomplish its efficiency
without sadism.

40:47.024 --> 40:47.956
Why, Gill?

40:48.025 --> 40:50.585
Why?

Worked.

At first ...

40:55.099 --> 40:56.088
it worked.

40:57.702 --> 40:58.634
Then Melakon ...

began to take over.

You've got to tell those people
what happened!

who can prevent the slaughter!

they use is too strong.

this spy must be taken to Melakon.

this is no ordinary Zeon.
