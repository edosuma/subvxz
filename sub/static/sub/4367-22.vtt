00:14.788 --> 00:17.807
Did you know?

00:21.926 --> 00:24.084
_

00:32.253 --> 00:34.137
_

00:34.172 --> 00:36.692
_

00:50.907 --> 00:54.259
Can you hear me?

00:54.261 --> 00:56.311
Absolutely.

01:02.235 --> 01:03.602
Can you hear me?

01:03.604 --> 01:04.686
Yes.

01:04.688 --> 01:06.438
3:00.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.441
I understand.

01:11.027 --> 01:14.113
Come on, Harold.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.365
The fun's just getting started.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.834
Not exactly a great moment
for a personal call.

01:18.836 --> 01:22.504
4:00.

01:34.834 --> 01:38.003
11:00.

01:38.005 --> 01:40.939
10:00.

01:40.941 --> 01:42.774
Aah!

01:42.776 --> 01:44.476
We need to move, Reese.
Now.

01:44.478 --> 01:47.512
- Stay.
- Stay.

01:47.514 --> 01:50.566
Follow my lead.

01:52.619 --> 01:54.369
Abbreviate audio prompts,
please.

01:54.371 --> 01:55.871
Confirmed.

01:55.873 --> 01:57.906
And the numbers
aren't doing it for me.

01:57.908 --> 02:01.376
Let's try an ascending
tone cue for right,

02:01.378 --> 02:03.579
descending for left.

02:16.259 --> 02:18.810
1:00.

02:18.812 --> 02:21.813
9:00.

02:21.815 --> 02:22.898
2:00.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.901
_

02:37.080 --> 02:39.231
Move now.

02:39.233 --> 02:42.034
Let's go.

02:44.954 --> 02:47.706
I thought you said I wouldn't
enjoy this, Harold.

02:47.708 --> 02:49.841
Sadly, though, if my access
to the machine

02:49.843 --> 02:52.544
only lasts 24 hours,
it's time to go.

02:57.251 --> 02:58.884
Your friend John's
been keeping up with us.

02:58.886 --> 03:00.552
How is that?

03:00.554 --> 03:03.255
I don't know.

03:03.257 --> 03:06.441
I wasn't asking you, Harold.

03:12.232 --> 03:14.733
You wanna fill me in
on who you're talking to, John?

03:14.735 --> 03:16.935
Our fairy godmother?

03:16.937 --> 03:19.404
The group you used
to get your intel from.

03:19.406 --> 03:20.706
You called them Research.

03:20.708 --> 03:22.541
Your ex-boss called it
Northern Lights.

03:22.543 --> 03:24.609
The ones your pal
told me don't exist.

03:24.611 --> 03:26.078
No, they exist.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.963
They're just an "it"
rather than a "them."

03:27.965 --> 03:29.781
A machine.

03:29.783 --> 03:33.802
You mean an AI?

03:41.561 --> 03:43.011
Your tracker.

03:43.013 --> 03:46.481
Maybe Finch
doesn't want to be found.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.808
Give me a location on Finch.

04:02.148 --> 04:03.699
You know almost everything
that's happening,

04:03.701 --> 04:08.153
and you won't tell me
the one thing I need?

04:08.155 --> 04:09.871
Okay, look, I already
broke you out of jail tonight.

04:09.873 --> 04:11.623
I'm not springing you
from the funny farm.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.292
Fine.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.827
How about a car we can use?

04:15.829 --> 04:19.497
9:00.

04:22.835 --> 04:24.836
Tell us your story again,
Detective.

04:24.838 --> 04:27.839
It's not my story.
It's what happened.

04:27.841 --> 04:29.775
The suspect emerged.
He had a weapon.

04:29.777 --> 04:32.144
I fired on him
with lethal force.

04:32.146 --> 04:36.198
I don't know what happened
to the suspect's weapon.

04:37.817 --> 04:40.869
You're not helping
yourself, Detective.

04:40.871 --> 04:44.206
We'll start again
in 20 minutes.

04:55.868 --> 04:58.203
So Root wants access
to this machine.

04:58.205 --> 05:00.038
She says she wants
to set it free,

05:00.040 --> 05:01.973
but to do that,
she has to find it first.

05:01.975 --> 05:04.893
Attention.

05:05.084 --> 05:06.694
_

05:06.712 --> 05:09.981
Wait,
this doesn't have anything

05:09.983 --> 05:13.318
to do with Finch, does it?

05:13.320 --> 05:16.071
Let's go.
Where is this car?

05:31.872 --> 05:35.006
_

05:35.008 --> 05:37.793
Fine.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.795
We're gonna need
to make a pit stop.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.346
Someone needs our help.

05:41.348 --> 05:43.248
And the whole "Prevent
the AI apocalypse" thing?

05:43.250 --> 05:45.183
You like a challenge, Shaw.

05:45.185 --> 05:48.720
We're the good guys,
which means we have to do both.

05:53.259 --> 06:00.615
_

06:00.617 --> 06:03.235
_

06:09.826 --> 06:12.043
Don't move.
The cops will be here soon.

06:12.045 --> 06:14.446
Understand?

06:15.465 --> 06:17.082
Are we done?

06:17.084 --> 06:20.285
We're done.

06:27.728 --> 06:29.261
We're gonna need
another vehicle

06:29.263 --> 06:30.962
and a way out.

06:30.964 --> 06:33.932
This time,
ask for something fast.

06:33.934 --> 06:35.434
The machine says
this is the one.

06:35.436 --> 06:39.438
This better not be
another station wagon.

06:45.745 --> 06:47.195
What's this for?

06:47.197 --> 06:49.080
To help you feel
less inadequate

06:49.082 --> 06:53.452
while I drive this thing.

06:57.542 --> 07:02.071
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

07:05.104 --> 07:06.487
What was the plan?

07:07.908 --> 07:10.358
You wanted to kill people.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.776
But we got you.

07:11.778 --> 07:13.644
Stopped you.

07:17.517 --> 07:19.350
So it doesn't matter now.

07:19.352 --> 07:21.185
May as well talk to me.

07:26.692 --> 07:30.161
The ferry.
Tell me about the ferry.

07:44.009 --> 07:45.443
What took you so damn long?

07:45.445 --> 07:47.528
Do I or do I not
have a locator beacon?

07:47.530 --> 07:50.114
Control felt the Decima
situation took priority.

07:50.116 --> 07:52.367
And we have
an ongoing situation

07:52.369 --> 07:53.785
with some rogue operatives,

07:53.787 --> 07:55.620
including your former
Executive Assistant.

07:55.622 --> 07:57.155
We're concerned Northern Lights

07:57.157 --> 07:59.073
might have been compromised

07:59.075 --> 08:02.243
and that she might
even have full access.

08:02.245 --> 08:04.695
This is very bad news indeed.

08:04.697 --> 08:06.197
We go to Contingency One.

08:06.199 --> 08:09.500
No cell phones.
Avoid all cameras.

08:09.501 --> 08:11.482
_

08:11.483 --> 08:17.176
_

08:26.018 --> 08:29.354
Your machine is telling me
about all these people, Harold.

08:29.356 --> 08:31.389
Their secrets.

08:31.391 --> 08:33.357
I'm beginning to understand
how you acquired

08:33.360 --> 08:37.779
such a dim view
of humanity, Harold. Wait.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.947
How rude of me.

08:39.948 --> 08:44.702
I can see for the first time,
and you're blind.

08:44.704 --> 08:47.922
We'll need some glasses
for Harold.

08:47.924 --> 08:50.758
I'm sure you know
his prescription.

08:53.212 --> 08:56.714
3:00.

09:07.426 --> 09:09.394
How's that?

09:09.396 --> 09:10.945
I still don't know
where we're going.

09:10.947 --> 09:12.230
Yes, you do.

09:12.232 --> 09:15.233
We're going to find
your machine.

09:19.488 --> 09:21.406
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:21.408 --> 09:23.124
You holding up okay, Carter?

09:23.126 --> 09:24.992
Eh.

09:24.994 --> 09:26.077
Here.

09:26.079 --> 09:29.613
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

09:29.615 --> 09:32.333
So I made my statement.

09:32.335 --> 09:34.635
I don't know what else to do.

09:34.637 --> 09:36.554
Still no sign of the weapon.

09:36.556 --> 09:39.223
You really ought to contact
your union rep.

09:39.225 --> 09:41.292
No.

09:41.294 --> 09:43.478
I'll be fine.

09:45.130 --> 09:47.298
I know who took the weapon.

09:47.300 --> 09:51.352
I recognized one of the unis
at the crime scene.

09:51.354 --> 09:53.654
He was questioned
in the HR sting,

09:53.656 --> 09:56.474
but they let him go.

09:56.476 --> 09:59.861
Gonna have Fusco have
a little talk with him.

10:03.866 --> 10:06.250
That's always been the problem
with you, Carter.

10:06.252 --> 10:07.919
You--

10:07.921 --> 10:09.587
you just never figured out

10:09.589 --> 10:12.507
when to keep
your big mouth shut.

10:18.163 --> 10:22.183
Listen, you always
been okay to me, Carter.

10:22.185 --> 10:25.303
And frankly,
I don't like killing women.

10:26.889 --> 10:28.356
You keep digging,

10:28.358 --> 10:30.057
we're gonna put you
in the ground,

10:30.059 --> 10:32.477
just like we did
to your boyfriend.

10:32.479 --> 10:35.797
You drag your recovering
dirtbag partner into this,

10:35.799 --> 10:38.849
we will pull
the rip cord on him too.

10:38.851 --> 10:42.236
And maybe...
your kid.

10:44.523 --> 10:48.543
Now... are you gonna do
yourself a favor

10:48.545 --> 10:52.747
and sit here and take it?

10:55.818 --> 10:58.869
That's a good girl.

11:08.213 --> 11:09.647
Hey, boss. _

11:09.649 --> 11:11.516
No, she's not gonna
give us a problem.

11:11.518 --> 11:14.018
Next up, we kill
Elias's right-hand man.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.237
Then we get the man himself.

11:16.239 --> 11:18.722
I called in a couple of favors.

11:18.724 --> 11:22.560
Prison transfer tonight.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.745
Where's Bear?

11:24.747 --> 11:26.998
Staying with a guy named Leon.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.083
Didn't think you even
liked the dog.

11:29.085 --> 11:31.235
Like him? He's the only reason
I'm sticking around.

11:31.237 --> 11:32.637
Why are we here?

11:32.639 --> 11:33.905
Because the machine said
this is

11:33.907 --> 11:35.540
where I'll find the answer.

11:35.542 --> 11:36.791
What was the question?

11:36.793 --> 11:38.376
Where the machine is located.

11:38.378 --> 11:39.677
Can't it just tell you?

11:39.679 --> 11:41.879
I think Finch
programmed it not to,

11:41.881 --> 11:43.214
to protect it.

11:43.216 --> 11:44.682
No offense.

11:44.684 --> 11:46.801
Maybe Finch wants control
of the machine himself.

11:46.803 --> 11:49.687
If Finch had something
to do with the virus,

11:49.689 --> 11:52.273
I'm sure he had his reasons.

11:52.275 --> 11:54.925
On the upside,
hopefully the machine

11:54.927 --> 11:57.028
won't have told Root
where it is either.

11:57.030 --> 12:01.449
Next time I see that woman,

12:01.451 --> 12:03.768
I'm shooting her.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.603
And not in the knee.

12:11.877 --> 12:14.278
"Ghost Alpha Kilo."

12:14.280 --> 12:15.379
What's that?

12:15.381 --> 12:17.748
A book.

12:20.928 --> 12:23.732
_

12:31.897 --> 12:34.732
That's the tech guy.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.389
Nathan Ingram.

12:37.219 --> 12:38.400
_

12:38.438 --> 12:39.854
He worked with Finch?

12:39.856 --> 12:43.324
They built
the machine together.

12:45.777 --> 12:48.696
There's something back there.

13:04.763 --> 13:06.180
Any guess for the combination?

13:18.009 --> 13:20.144
Who are they?

13:20.146 --> 13:21.979
I don't know.

13:21.981 --> 13:23.481
People they helped.

13:23.483 --> 13:26.651
People they tried--

13:29.121 --> 13:32.907
You knew her.

13:34.543 --> 13:38.496
Cared about her.

13:38.498 --> 13:41.549
Is she alive?

13:41.551 --> 13:43.834
No.

13:55.046 --> 13:56.931
This isn't Finch's handwriting.

13:56.933 --> 13:59.517
Ingram must have been looking
for the machine too,

13:59.519 --> 14:01.152
after they gave it
to the government.

14:01.154 --> 14:02.570
Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

14:02.572 --> 14:04.855
Hanford, Washington.
Comanche Peak, Texas.

14:04.857 --> 14:08.926
He narrowed it down
to those three places.

14:08.928 --> 14:10.611
You know what
they've got in common?

14:10.613 --> 14:13.064
They're all
secure federal sites.

14:13.066 --> 14:14.949
For nuclear fuel storage.

14:14.951 --> 14:16.701
When Root was torturing me,

14:16.703 --> 14:18.369
she wanted to know
about an engineer

14:18.371 --> 14:20.237
named Daniel Aquino.

14:20.239 --> 14:22.072
A nuclear engineer.

14:22.074 --> 14:24.041
He must have had something
to do with the facility

14:24.043 --> 14:27.178
the machine is stored in.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.763
What did Root want to know?

14:28.765 --> 14:32.416
The name of the man who hired
him for Northern Lights.

14:32.418 --> 14:35.252
And what was his name?

14:35.254 --> 14:38.189
Lawrence.

14:38.191 --> 14:40.024
Lawrence Szilard.

14:40.026 --> 14:43.728
Nice to finally meet you,
Larry.

14:43.730 --> 14:45.896
I've got some questions.

15:15.502 --> 15:17.336
What do you want, Harold?

15:17.338 --> 15:19.505
You haven't been
in the office for days.

15:19.507 --> 15:21.690
You won't return
any of my calls.

15:21.692 --> 15:24.560
I quit.

15:26.813 --> 15:31.200
I know you've been
looking for the machine.

15:31.202 --> 15:33.152
Nathan, if you're
trying to get back in

15:33.154 --> 15:35.404
to access
the irrelevant numbers--

15:35.406 --> 15:37.072
It won't work, I know.
You locked me out.

15:37.074 --> 15:39.024
You were always
the better engineer.

15:39.026 --> 15:41.210
But I do have
one advantage over you.

15:41.212 --> 15:42.861
I am the face of IFT,

15:42.863 --> 15:44.380
which means
when I call a reporter

15:44.382 --> 15:47.166
to meet me for coffee,
he'll be there.

15:47.168 --> 15:50.803
What are you
going to do, Nathan?

15:50.805 --> 15:53.872
I'm going to tell them
what we did.

15:53.874 --> 15:55.040
What we built.

15:55.042 --> 15:57.343
- No, you can't do that.
- Why?

15:57.345 --> 15:59.061
Because the government
will shut it down?

15:59.063 --> 16:00.930
Because of the greater good?
I'm sick of hearing it.

16:00.932 --> 16:03.265
No, it's not just that anymore.

16:03.267 --> 16:04.767
I've been looking into this.

16:04.769 --> 16:06.718
I think the government
may be killing them.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.655
The engineers that Corwin
had reassemble

16:09.657 --> 16:11.156
the machine
after we shipped it off?

16:11.158 --> 16:13.225
There have been accidents,
disappearances.

16:13.227 --> 16:15.778
The head of the project,
a man named Lawrence Szilard,

16:15.780 --> 16:17.530
went missing last month.

16:17.532 --> 16:19.164
Harold, you have been running
so long, it's rattled you.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.617
Alicia isn't going
to have me bumped off.

16:21.619 --> 16:24.119
It might be out of her control.

16:24.121 --> 16:28.574
We gave the government
the ultimate power.

16:28.576 --> 16:30.742
If they know
you've called a journalist,

16:30.744 --> 16:32.795
they won't take any chances.

16:32.797 --> 16:34.713
They'll kill you
and anybody else

16:34.715 --> 16:36.048
they think might know about it.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.083
You've never trusted anyone.

16:38.085 --> 16:40.853
Not me, not the machine.

16:40.855 --> 16:44.256
Have you even told your fiancee
your real name yet?

16:47.060 --> 16:50.095
I'm waiting
for the right moment.

16:50.097 --> 16:51.313
Nathan, please,

16:51.315 --> 16:55.868
tell me what I can do
to stop you.

16:55.870 --> 16:59.771
Give me back
the irrelevant list.

16:59.773 --> 17:02.741
You could even help me.

17:02.743 --> 17:05.743
What, you and me sitting here,

17:05.746 --> 17:08.280
trying to rescue them
one at a time?

17:08.281 --> 17:10.549
Someone's number's
on that thing right now.

17:10.550 --> 17:11.967
It's gonna be erased
at midnight.

17:11.969 --> 17:14.887
Maybe...
maybe we can help them.

17:14.888 --> 17:16.672
I'm not trying to help them.

17:16.674 --> 17:18.957
I'm trying to help you.

17:22.896 --> 17:24.646
34th Street ferry terminal.

17:24.648 --> 17:27.983
8:00 AM tomorrow.

17:29.686 --> 17:33.822
It's time
we tell our side of the story.

17:33.824 --> 17:36.609
You should be there.

17:48.922 --> 17:51.340
Time for a chat, Lawrence.

17:51.342 --> 17:53.042
How did you know
where to find me?

17:53.044 --> 17:55.294
Let's say a friend told me.

17:55.296 --> 17:56.995
And who are you?
What do you want?

17:56.997 --> 18:00.933
We wanna know
about Northern Lights.

18:00.935 --> 18:02.017
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:02.019 --> 18:06.472
I have nothing to say.

18:06.474 --> 18:07.890
Your daughter, Christine.

18:07.892 --> 18:10.359
In LA, where you hid her.

18:10.361 --> 18:13.011
Such a shame if people
running Northern Lights

18:13.013 --> 18:16.782
got a hold of her.

18:16.784 --> 18:19.201
Please,
there's no need for that.

18:19.203 --> 18:20.852
I can tell you how it began.

18:20.854 --> 18:23.238
You were approached
by a woman named Alicia Corwin.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.124
She was killed last year.

18:25.126 --> 18:27.076
Such a tragedy.

18:27.078 --> 18:29.128
All of my colleagues
on that project died

18:29.130 --> 18:31.863
in suspicious circumstances
in the past two years.

18:31.865 --> 18:34.166
As far as I know,
I'm the last one alive.

18:34.168 --> 18:35.584
And you're the last person

18:35.586 --> 18:37.970
who can tell us
about Northern Lights.

18:37.972 --> 18:39.871
Szilard's in Central Park.

18:39.873 --> 18:42.758
Guessing that's
where we're gonna find Finch.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.677
Another pit stop?

18:44.679 --> 18:46.311
How often do you guys
get a number?

18:46.313 --> 18:48.180
Some days, none.

18:48.182 --> 18:50.983
Doesn't seem like today's gonna
be one of those days though.

18:50.985 --> 18:54.403
Let's go.

18:57.190 --> 18:59.658
I told you if I can't
have you, no one will.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.527
No one, Katie.

19:01.529 --> 19:04.079
No one.

19:04.081 --> 19:07.449
Congratulations.

19:11.454 --> 19:14.123
We were contracted
to build a structure.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.208
It had to be hidden
in plain sight

19:16.210 --> 19:18.910
and have power
for 50,000 people.

19:18.912 --> 19:21.130
At first, you know,
I said, "That's a joke.

19:21.132 --> 19:23.215
What about
a nuclear reactor?"

19:23.217 --> 19:25.467
The next day, I was given specs

19:25.469 --> 19:27.753
for a nuclear
reprocessing facility

19:27.755 --> 19:30.756
and the army corps of engineers
as a work force.

19:30.758 --> 19:33.275
And then it started to arrive

19:33.277 --> 19:37.479
disguised as radioactive
material to evade scrutiny.

19:37.481 --> 19:39.531
We were just told to--
to plug it in.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.033
They would take care
of the rest,

19:41.035 --> 19:42.534
but I've always been
the curious type.

19:42.536 --> 19:43.952
So you took a look at the data.

19:43.954 --> 19:45.404
Just the I/O.
The rest was encrypted.

19:45.406 --> 19:49.208
But what I saw...

19:49.210 --> 19:50.959
it was like a glimpse
of the future.

19:50.961 --> 19:53.962
Elegant, intuitive.

19:53.964 --> 19:58.617
Practically alive.

19:58.619 --> 20:02.788
It's speaking to you right now,
isn't it?

20:04.340 --> 20:07.426
Move now.
Multiple threats.

20:07.428 --> 20:10.896
Come with us.

20:10.898 --> 20:14.733
Tell me,
where is Northern Lights?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.902
- You're not gonna harm it.
- Never.

20:16.904 --> 20:19.238
- I want to set it free.
- Good. Of course.

20:20.641 --> 20:22.775
No.

20:22.777 --> 20:23.975
Now take the woman.

20:23.977 --> 20:26.478
Where is it?
Please.

20:31.118 --> 20:33.452
Let's go.
We have to go.

20:34.487 --> 20:35.754
Come on.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.957
They murdered him, Harold.

20:38.959 --> 20:41.126
He was our best chance.
How will we find it now?

20:41.128 --> 20:43.345
Imminent threat.

20:43.347 --> 20:46.999
Don't you touch him.

20:55.692 --> 20:57.175
Did she do this?

20:57.177 --> 21:01.346
No, your old employers did.

21:02.816 --> 21:04.683
This way.

21:04.685 --> 21:08.186
Go on.
I'll catch up with you.

21:11.024 --> 21:13.208
Stay back.

21:14.861 --> 21:17.195
Finch!

21:20.718 --> 21:22.534
All right, enough.

21:22.536 --> 21:24.002
I know where it is.

21:24.004 --> 21:26.255
I'll take you to it.

21:33.347 --> 21:35.180
Looks like your friend
had a change of heart.

21:48.005 --> 21:50.206
The ferry.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.074
Tell me about the ferry.

21:53.711 --> 21:55.094
What were you going to do?

22:00.417 --> 22:03.436
- Semtex.
- Semtex.

22:06.424 --> 22:09.758
Loaded on a van.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.360
Park it
next to Liberty Island ferry.

22:11.362 --> 22:13.729
How would you detonate?

22:16.367 --> 22:19.785
Me.

22:19.787 --> 22:21.821
I am the detonator.

22:21.823 --> 22:24.440
Suicide bomb.

22:45.562 --> 22:48.347
I found this
in Szilard's briefcase.

22:48.349 --> 22:49.732
Baggage claim ticket for a trip

22:49.734 --> 22:51.684
to Portland, Oregon,
four years ago.

22:51.686 --> 22:53.653
Portland's the nearest airport
to the nuclear fac--

22:53.655 --> 22:55.655
To the nuclear facility
at Hanford, Washington.

22:55.657 --> 22:57.607
That's where Szilard worked.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.025
That's where
Northern Lights is.

22:59.027 --> 23:02.311
So that's where Root's headed.

23:05.499 --> 23:07.533
Police business, ma'am.

23:07.535 --> 23:10.119
Let's see your badge.

23:10.121 --> 23:12.288
New Yorkers.

23:23.333 --> 23:26.652
I'm getting in the car now.

23:26.654 --> 23:28.604
Wheels up in 40.

23:28.606 --> 23:32.191
Flight plan for St. Barts.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.526
I'm sure the islands are lovely

23:33.528 --> 23:35.394
this time of year,
Mr. Chandler,

23:35.396 --> 23:39.565
but my friend and I need
your jet to take us to Portland.

23:43.871 --> 23:45.821
Carter, I've been worried.
You okay?

23:45.823 --> 23:48.541
I've been better.
But, look, that can wait.

23:48.543 --> 23:51.494
I think HR and Yogorov's crew

23:51.496 --> 23:53.829
are gonna take out
Elias tonight.

23:53.831 --> 23:55.631
Elias tried to kill you, Joss.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.216
He kidnapped your son.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.802
His well-being isn't exactly
a priority for me.

23:59.804 --> 24:01.921
His lieutenant
was gunned down this morning.

24:01.923 --> 24:04.890
The first thing Elias did
was get his bodyguards paroled

24:04.892 --> 24:07.893
to watch his man
in the hospital.

24:07.895 --> 24:09.762
At least he's loyal.

24:12.433 --> 24:13.516
Are you okay?

24:13.518 --> 24:15.184
Sorry, Joss, gotta go.

24:15.186 --> 24:16.569
Please just keep
your head down.

24:16.571 --> 24:19.572
You too.
Though I know you won't.

24:19.574 --> 24:22.441
You tell that thing
to get us out of here...

24:22.443 --> 24:25.661
unless you want me
to end this chase my way.

24:25.663 --> 24:28.831
You heard her.
Exit routes, please.

24:31.335 --> 24:34.236
300 yards right.

24:34.238 --> 24:35.187
There is no right.

24:35.189 --> 24:38.741
200 yards right.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.793
In 200 yards, turn right.

24:40.795 --> 24:41.844
What right, John?

24:41.846 --> 24:43.629
You gotta trust, Shaw.

24:43.631 --> 24:47.516
100 yards right.

24:47.518 --> 24:51.020
This is gonna
be a rough landing.

25:17.714 --> 25:22.785
Need to borrow
your helicopter, fellas.

25:31.912 --> 25:34.513
End of the road, Elias.

25:42.656 --> 25:46.826
Oh, that sort
of prisoner transfer.

25:46.828 --> 25:49.745
Heard a story about you, Elias.

25:49.747 --> 25:52.581
Your daddy wanted
to put you down.

25:52.583 --> 25:55.984
He had two of his goombahs take
you for a walk in the woods.

25:55.986 --> 25:57.319
Does this story have a moral?

25:57.321 --> 26:00.756
Yeah.
What goes around comes around.

26:00.758 --> 26:04.126
No.
You don't get to talk to me.

26:05.846 --> 26:08.330
I'm true to what I am.

26:08.332 --> 26:10.266
Like my friend
Mr. Yogorov here.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.268
I killed his father.
He kills me.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.437
Fair is fair.

26:14.439 --> 26:18.023
But you, you're a--
you're an oath breaker.

26:18.025 --> 26:20.226
You're a worm.

26:20.228 --> 26:23.612
I think that's enough of you.

26:25.115 --> 26:28.033
Piece of crap.

26:32.907 --> 26:36.208
Please, please, I got a family.

26:36.210 --> 26:38.627
Ohh!

27:04.554 --> 27:06.722
Detective Carter.

27:06.724 --> 27:09.224
What a funny old world.

27:10.994 --> 27:14.363
Where are we going?

27:14.365 --> 27:17.065
I don't know.

27:18.965 --> 27:23.121
_

27:40.558 --> 27:42.641
Breach in
Containment System four.

27:42.643 --> 27:45.027
Switching
to emergency override.

27:45.029 --> 27:47.429
Everyone leave now.

28:02.445 --> 28:04.830
Code.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.120
Keypad code.

28:09.286 --> 28:11.681
_

28:13.490 --> 28:14.790
It looks like our carriage

28:14.792 --> 28:18.310
has turned back
into a pumpkin, Harold.

28:18.312 --> 28:21.697
Doesn't matter.
We made it.

28:23.016 --> 28:25.634
You can't be in here.
You have to leave now.

28:25.636 --> 28:27.486
- What do you think you're--
- Open the door.

28:27.488 --> 28:30.823
Are you crazy?
You'll kill us all.

28:30.825 --> 28:33.542
No.
Just you.

28:41.251 --> 28:44.169
Come on, Harold.

28:44.171 --> 28:46.372
Time to meet God.

28:46.374 --> 28:50.225
Please don't set your hopes
too high, Ms. Groves.

29:01.004 --> 29:03.839
Hey.
You're not allowed in here.

29:03.841 --> 29:07.276
I said
you're not allowed in--

29:28.164 --> 29:31.166
Where is it?

29:31.168 --> 29:33.969
I'm sorry.

29:33.971 --> 29:38.974
You said you wanted
to set the machine free.

29:40.176 --> 29:42.928
I already did.

29:44.564 --> 29:46.932
Where are you?

29:48.935 --> 29:51.320
Please talk to me.

29:54.024 --> 29:57.192
You lied to me.

29:57.194 --> 29:59.528
I believed you.

29:59.530 --> 30:01.580
I believed in you.

30:01.582 --> 30:02.665
Ms. Groves--

30:02.667 --> 30:05.734
My name is Root.

30:15.045 --> 30:16.045
Harold.

30:16.047 --> 30:18.914
Are you okay?

30:26.973 --> 30:30.225
Is this what you expected?

30:31.611 --> 30:33.929
It's what I hoped.

30:47.187 --> 30:50.256
Our friend
is going to talk to the press.

30:50.258 --> 30:53.759
- We can't allow that to happen.
- He's a public figure.

30:53.761 --> 30:55.978
Making him disappear
will be complicated.

30:55.980 --> 30:59.298
It seems to me
we have the solution in hand.

31:04.938 --> 31:08.440
The next island ferry
will be leaving in ten minutes.

31:08.442 --> 31:09.692
All passengers...

31:11.145 --> 31:12.477
Hey.

31:12.479 --> 31:15.497
Asif.
Come on.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.033
Time to wake up.

31:21.821 --> 31:23.956
Congratulations, Asif.

31:23.958 --> 31:26.475
You've completed your mission.

31:56.956 --> 31:59.691
Harold!

32:00.994 --> 32:04.330
I knew you would come,
my friend.

32:04.332 --> 32:08.250
Time for us to face the music.

32:08.252 --> 32:11.937
Aah!

32:17.845 --> 32:21.096
Turn around, you get a bullet.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.988
You didn't do this yourself?

32:29.990 --> 32:32.557
I couldn't.
I'd locked myself out.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.493
The machine was designed
to accept alterations

32:34.495 --> 32:37.363
in its programming only
as a response to an attack.

32:37.365 --> 32:38.697
I knew that sooner or later

32:38.699 --> 32:41.033
someone would try
to take it over,

32:41.035 --> 32:42.534
but I didn't know who.

32:42.536 --> 32:44.403
So I made sure
that when they did

32:44.405 --> 32:46.738
they'd do it with my code.

32:51.878 --> 32:55.431
You hid a virus within a virus?

32:55.433 --> 32:57.716
I realized
that the people Nathan and I

32:57.718 --> 33:01.887
had entrusted the machine to
were the wrong people

33:01.889 --> 33:03.605
and that the only way
to protect it

33:03.607 --> 33:05.974
would be to teach it
to protect itself.

33:05.976 --> 33:09.395
I didn't want to involve you
in this business, Mr. Reese,

33:09.397 --> 33:14.433
because I had hoped that,
if I hadn't returned,

33:14.435 --> 33:18.087
you would continue
what we had started.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.626
That's not good.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.746
- We should go.
- She comes too.

33:27.748 --> 33:31.616
If we leave her,
they'll kill her.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.067
Shaw.

33:49.069 --> 33:53.472
You should have
killed me better, Hersh.

34:04.617 --> 34:06.118
I know it's a minor matter

34:06.120 --> 34:08.203
compared to the total
and utter catastrophe

34:08.205 --> 34:10.489
I'm looking at here, but...

34:10.491 --> 34:14.476
I didn't think
you'd turn traitor, Shaw.

34:14.478 --> 34:16.378
That's a strong word
to be throwing around

34:16.380 --> 34:19.264
given where we're standing.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.833
What do you want?

34:20.835 --> 34:24.219
A word or two
with your new friend.

34:28.358 --> 34:31.193
I always knew
there was someone behind Ingram.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.178
Like a black hole.

34:33.179 --> 34:35.679
Invisible, but powerful.

34:35.681 --> 34:40.485
So tell me,
where did you move the machine?

34:40.487 --> 34:42.905
It moved itself.

34:46.242 --> 34:48.744
But who controls it?

34:48.746 --> 34:50.879
As of now, it controls itself.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.199
The numbers, will they
continue to come to us?

34:54.201 --> 34:56.034
That will be up to the machine.

34:56.036 --> 35:00.305
If they don't start up again,
the country is defenseless.

35:00.307 --> 35:03.091
No,
just less well-defended.

35:03.093 --> 35:06.461
I think we both understand
that what's at stake here

35:06.463 --> 35:09.798
has moved beyond
simply defending the country.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.318
Has it?

35:13.320 --> 35:18.390
You built the machine for us
to use to protect people.

35:18.392 --> 35:20.725
We do, very well.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.561
Don't fight us.

35:22.563 --> 35:26.064
Help us recover it
or rebuild it.

35:26.066 --> 35:28.917
You can dictate your terms.

35:28.919 --> 35:30.735
You have my word.

35:30.737 --> 35:35.240
You gave my friend your word.

35:35.242 --> 35:38.727
And you killed him.

35:38.729 --> 35:42.047
We're leaving.

35:49.689 --> 35:54.059
You think you're choosing
the right side, Shaw?

35:54.061 --> 35:57.246
Really?

35:57.248 --> 36:01.733
You lied to me too.

36:35.818 --> 36:37.102
Nathan.

36:37.104 --> 36:39.187
- Nathan!
- Don't move.

36:39.189 --> 36:41.690
- You've been in an accident.
- I have to find my friend.

36:41.692 --> 36:44.076
Sir, I just need you
to lie still for me, okay?

36:44.078 --> 36:46.645
You've sustained injuries
to your neck and lower back.

36:46.647 --> 36:47.746
Do you understand?

36:47.748 --> 36:49.331
Doctor, quickly.

36:49.333 --> 36:52.784
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.257
Check the carotid.

37:02.679 --> 37:05.263
I'm calling it.
TOD...

37:05.265 --> 37:07.883
Nathan?

37:13.506 --> 37:15.190
It's done.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.775
We'll find out
if he talked to anyone

37:16.777 --> 37:19.895
and take care of them too.

37:40.550 --> 37:43.385
Harold?

37:47.840 --> 37:51.093
Harold?

37:54.097 --> 37:56.264
Harold?

37:58.568 --> 37:59.818
Help, please.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.687
I think my fiance
was on the ferry.

38:01.689 --> 38:03.689
- Do you know where--
- I'm sorry.

38:03.691 --> 38:07.325
This is everybody
we pulled out of the water.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.494
If you don't see him,

38:09.496 --> 38:14.733
the personal effects
we recovered are over there.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.493
Did you know?

39:04.974 --> 39:07.204
_

39:19.279 --> 39:20.869
_

39:29.348 --> 39:32.548
_

39:46.542 --> 39:49.594
How did it get moved?

39:49.596 --> 39:51.847
Exactly as you instructed.

39:51.849 --> 39:53.365
Over the last five weeks,

39:53.367 --> 39:55.567
one node at a time,
so it was never off-line.

39:55.569 --> 39:57.719
Moved from here in containers
marked for fissile materials.

39:57.721 --> 39:59.221
To where, I have no idea,

39:59.223 --> 40:00.722
which is what I thought
was the point.

40:00.724 --> 40:03.191
You didn't think
to call to confirm?

40:03.193 --> 40:06.695
I did call.
You confirmed it.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.037
We'll find it, ma'am.

40:16.039 --> 40:18.957
With something that large,
we'll find a way to track it.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.209
I'm sure--

40:21.211 --> 40:24.663
Yes, ma'am.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.557
Yes, ma'am.

40:35.559 --> 40:38.760
I'll seal the room.

40:52.441 --> 40:53.992
Fair enough.

41:05.404 --> 41:09.291
Finch, you think
we'll ever get another number?

41:09.293 --> 41:11.376
I don't know.

41:11.378 --> 41:14.846
Mr. Reese,
I owe you an explanation.

41:14.848 --> 41:16.281
And an apology.

41:16.283 --> 41:18.550
Three years ago,

41:18.552 --> 41:21.970
when I put the code out there
to free the machine,

41:21.972 --> 41:25.757
I had no idea
what path it would take

41:25.759 --> 41:30.228
or what unintended consequences
it might have.

41:30.230 --> 41:32.931
I never intended
to hurt anyone,

41:32.933 --> 41:37.202
but I accepted
that someone might get hurt.

41:37.204 --> 41:40.739
I always worried that events
that I had set in motion

41:40.741 --> 41:45.410
may have changed things
for you.

41:50.499 --> 41:53.335
My life changed
when I kept my mouth shut

41:53.337 --> 41:57.389
at an airport terminal
seven years ago.

41:57.391 --> 42:00.792
You didn't have anything
to do with that.

42:00.794 --> 42:03.762
You lost a friend.

42:03.764 --> 42:08.683
You did what you had to do.

42:12.638 --> 42:15.907
Since the numbers have stopped,

42:15.909 --> 42:17.242
it's not right you should go on

42:17.244 --> 42:19.678
paying me
as generously as you are.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.997
Since you give away
90% of what I pay you,

42:21.999 --> 42:25.533
I don't see
why I shouldn't continue.

42:41.300 --> 42:45.353
Ma'am, Research made contact
two minutes ago.

42:45.355 --> 42:47.171
A number.

42:47.173 --> 42:50.358
Get a team ready.

43:31.017 --> 43:34.853
Can you hear me?

43:39.758 --> 43:41.933
Absolutely.
