WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:05.600
 Today started off on a high note.
Ernie, the homeless guy,

00:05.672 --> 00:09.301
shattered the record
for the most blood donations in a month.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.866
Whoo!

00:10.943 --> 00:13.071
Congratulations, Ernie.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.444
Nineteen pints!

00:18.284 --> 00:20.616
 He probably needs a little more juice.
 Yes.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.712
 Even though we were
sending Ernie upstairs

00:23.790 --> 00:26.122
to most likely get some
of his own blood back,

00:26.192 --> 00:27.887
I couldn't help but smile.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.589
Today, Dr. Cox was
returning back to work

00:30.663 --> 00:33.393
after the accidental death
of three of his patients.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.627
OK, there he is.
Just play it cool.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.398
What is the latest
on Mrs. Riley up in 403?

00:38.471 --> 00:41.770
Mrs. Riley was admitted
with shortness of breath

00:41.841 --> 00:43.741
and then she developed a...

00:43.810 --> 00:46.904
 Stay cool. Stay cool.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.140
Aw, screw it!

00:48.214 --> 00:52.583
You sent those demons right back
to hell, didn't you? Straight to hell!

00:52.685 --> 00:56.382
OK, here's a bud
clearly in need of nipping.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.084
Newbie, there are some things
that, if they happen,

00:59.159 --> 01:01.184
we do want to make
a big deal out of them,

01:01.261 --> 01:03.559
a cure for cancer,
teaching dogs to talk,

01:03.630 --> 01:05.860
and you walking past the food cart

01:05.932 --> 01:08.492
without referring to cream cheese
as "cow fudge."

01:08.568 --> 01:09.865
I like to play with words.

01:09.936 --> 01:14.305
However, of all the things there
are to make a big deal out of,

01:14.374 --> 01:16.672
can my return to this hellhole please,

01:16.743 --> 01:19.371
please, please not be one of them?

01:19.446 --> 01:21.311
Well, sure thing, Perry.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.110
But, uh, there is one problem.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.880
 # Welcome back

01:28.955 --> 01:32.823
# Your dreams were your ticket out

01:32.892 --> 01:34.826
# Welcome back

01:34.894 --> 01:38.591
# To that same old place
that you laughed about

01:39.232 --> 01:43.168
# Well, the names have all changed
since you hung around

01:43.236 --> 01:47.070
# And them dreams have remained
since you turned around

01:47.140 --> 01:48.698
J.D.!

01:48.775 --> 01:50.675
That's when the background comes in.

01:50.743 --> 01:54.702
# Who'd have thought they'd lead you?
Who'd have thought they'd lead you? #

01:54.814 --> 01:57.305
That's a run I was gonna do,
but now is awkward.

01:57.383 --> 01:59.078
It's unbelievable.

02:00.086 --> 02:04.853
 Since Dr. Cox was back, I decided
to knock out all my errands extra quick.

02:04.924 --> 02:09.293
And what better way to get started than
with my new 18wheeler scooter horn?

02:16.469 --> 02:18.403
First, I grabbed a quick lunch.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.340
Then I returned some emails.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.244
Finally, a shortcut through
the mall parking lot,

02:30.316 --> 02:33.979
which meant dealing with the skate rats
and their famous ring o' fire.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.354
 Ring of fire!

02:38.858 --> 02:40.086
Whoohoo!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.718
Top that, dude!

02:43.429 --> 02:45.192
Sasha!

02:51.771 --> 02:55.207
# I can't do this all on my own

02:55.275 --> 02:58.403
# No, I know
I'm no Superman

03:02.081 --> 03:03.742
# I'm no Superman #

03:07.720 --> 03:10.450
 With Sasha
back in the scooter shop,

03:10.523 --> 03:13.651
I decided to buy a bike
and get some exercise.

03:13.726 --> 03:16.422
I can't remember
what happened to my old bike.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.225
Ow.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.858
 Nice helmet.
 Actually, it's not a helmet,

03:20.934 --> 03:22.196
it's a hairmet.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.635
See, it's got extra room built in
so you don't mess up your hairdo.

03:27.740 --> 03:31.301
I'm gonna go ahead and write you
a prescription for two testicles.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.208
You get it filled whenever.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.007
 That's weird. It felt like
that had happened before.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.142
When you work at a hospital five years,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.744
situations are bound
to repeat themselves.

03:41.888 --> 03:45.346
You know, doctor, I'm getting tired
of your sexual innuendo.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.188
In your endo.

03:48.394 --> 03:52.160
Dr. Kelso, it's so cold in Pediatrics,
the kids are wearing mittens.

03:52.265 --> 03:55.234
Hey, champ, what has two
thumbs and doesn't give a crap?

03:55.301 --> 03:57.769
Bob Kelso. How you doing?

03:58.004 --> 03:59.835
That's what déjà vu is,

03:59.906 --> 04:03.342
feeling like you've lived
the same moments a thousand times.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.635
Whether it's Turk's tepid response
to the baby stuff Carla makes him do...

04:07.714 --> 04:10.342
Friday, we meet the babyproofer
at the apartment.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.111
Oh, I can't wait!

04:12.185 --> 04:14.847
... or Dr. Cox giving
Elliot a hard time...

04:14.921 --> 04:17.981
Barbie, why did you order
this test? For the love of God,

04:18.057 --> 04:22.323
are you a real doctor
or a doctor like Dr Pepper's a doctor?

04:23.596 --> 04:26.224
Or the Janitor having
menace in his eyes.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.560
That looks like trouble.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.399
Hey, come here a sec.
We want to do stuff to you.

04:31.504 --> 04:34.962
OK, just distract them before
they do what they've got planned.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.639
 We were thinking...
 I got a riddle for you.

04:38.244 --> 04:41.680
 This isn't how you said it would go.
 Troy. We're listening.

04:41.748 --> 04:45.582
Two coins add up to 30 cents,
and one of them is not a nickel.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.212
I think I've heard this before.
What are they?

04:48.321 --> 04:50.949
It's a riddle.
You figure it out.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.888
Troy, get your hat.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.725
We're going to the bank.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.260
Look who's back, Mrs. Goldstein.
It's Dr. Cox.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.430
How was Acapulco?

05:06.506 --> 05:08.667
We told everyone
you were in Acapulco.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.971
I never went to Acapulco,
Mrs. Goldstein.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.138
I lost three patients and spent
the last two weeks on my couch

05:14.213 --> 05:17.876
trying to drink myself to death so that
my victims and I could be reunited

05:17.950 --> 05:21.113
in the afterlife and they could
rightly have their vengeance.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.711
I realized that that tactic
would never work,

05:23.790 --> 05:27.749
as I'd be sent straight to hell,
which, I imagine is a lot like Acapulco,

05:27.827 --> 05:31.456
only there'd be fewer Latin men
trying to sell me Chiclets on the beach.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.294
All the best.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.028
Is there a reason
you're still near me?

05:37.136 --> 05:40.765
We covered Mrs. Goldstein while you
were gone, but she's your patient.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.809
Her BP's dropping. It might
be time to push thrombolytics.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.844
Yeah, but she could bleed out.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.346
I suppose you could wait
and see how she does.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.938
Then she could decompensate.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.985
Well, those are the two options,
so what are you gonna do?

05:54.520 --> 05:56.181
I'll be right back.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.652
Did you guys just see that?

05:58.758 --> 06:01.522
Dr. Cox had to make a decision,
he completely froze.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.154
He's probably just
thinking it over, Elliot.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.495
He never used to think things over.
He made gut calls right away.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.864
Listen, Reid,

06:08.935 --> 06:12.029
normally any damage
to Dr. Cox's oversized ego

06:12.105 --> 06:14.869
would be cause for celebration.
Yet, for some reason,

06:14.941 --> 06:18.900
I'm not wearing a party hat, sitting
bareass on the hospital copier machine.

06:19.011 --> 06:22.742
You know why? It's not because
I have "Johnny" tattooed on my butt.

06:22.815 --> 06:26.376
He was a Navy buddy. If you went
through what we did, you'd understand.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.750
 Again with the déjà vu.

06:28.821 --> 06:31.551
It's because
your little theory is way off.

06:31.624 --> 06:34.525
If you don't want to be there
for him, it's your decision.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.221
But I'm going to be.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.291
J.D. Robs the ball!
Black guy open!

06:45.037 --> 06:46.504
No ball in the hall.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.069
 Sorry, Leonard.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.303
I wouldn't be mad
if that was the first time.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.107
They come three to a can.
Why you playing basketball?

06:54.180 --> 06:56.341
I thought you had
to have lunch with Carla.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.385
She's taking a pregnancy nap
so I get to do whatever I want.

06:59.452 --> 07:03.013
I'm telling you, J.D.,
Carla being pregnant is awesome for me.

07:03.923 --> 07:07.825
 I get to watch whatever I want
while she reads her pregnancy book.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.861
 I get to eat all the good food.
 Echhh.

07:20.306 --> 07:23.139
And, of course, ring of fire.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.177
Ring of fire!

07:27.013 --> 07:29.174
 Bottom line, pregnancy's awesome!

07:31.684 --> 07:35.450
OK, two coins, equals 30 cents,
no nickels.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.523
I could swear we've done this before.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.558
You went to Yale for God's sake!

07:39.659 --> 07:42.560
Relax. I figured it out.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.186
A penny...

07:44.297 --> 07:46.265
and... a button

07:46.365 --> 07:48.265
that you wrote "29 cents" on.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.359
You think I don't
recognize your handwriting?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.562
Can't we just kill him?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.835
How's therapy going?

07:59.345 --> 08:02.712
 Dr. Cox, do you have a second?
 Of course.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.680
 I was wondering...
 You're done.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.048
 What?
 You asked for a second.

08:07.119 --> 08:10.885
I think you'll find I'm being quite
literal here at work today. Ask anyone.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.255
Lonnie, what happened earlier
when you said, "Give me a break"?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.852
You broke my sunglasses in half.

08:16.929 --> 08:20.695
Had to be done. The man
looked preposterous in aviators.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.260
You still haven't made a decision
about how to treat Mrs. Goldstein.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.636
Oh, thanks for the reminder, Barboo.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.572
What would I do without you?

08:29.642 --> 08:33.408
Look, joke if you want to, but
you're gonna have to make a decision.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.879
Mrs. Goldstein's life depends on it.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.647
But what if I'm wrong?

08:44.757 --> 08:46.918
All right. She'll have a ginger ale,

08:46.993 --> 08:49.427
he'll have a beer,
and I'll have an appletini.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.463
Hell, I'm gonna have a real drink.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.193
 Make it a nectarini.
 I don't know what that is.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.361
Oh, come on, Kevin.
You know. Make it.

08:58.404 --> 09:02.465
Make sure I don't have too many
nectarinis. I gotta drive my bike home.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.841
Don't worry about it. Carla can't drink.
She'll drive you home.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.880
 Right, baby?
 Sure.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.709
 Sweet.
 Better idea,

09:09.782 --> 09:12.410
come over to our place,
she's going straight to bed.

09:12.485 --> 09:16.251
 We'll stay up late, watch Judge Dredd.
 Ninetyninth viewing!

09:17.223 --> 09:20.351
OK, ice cold beer, nectarini

09:20.426 --> 09:22.121
and ginger ale.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.895
There's nothing better in this world

09:24.964 --> 09:27.728
than the first sip of
an ice cold beer after a long day.

09:28.434 --> 09:30.561
Ditto for a 'tini.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.469
 It really takes the edge off.
 That's it.

09:33.539 --> 09:35.063
No beer for you. It's not fair.

09:35.141 --> 09:38.201
I'm here pregnant, you two
are having the time of your lives.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.438
From now on, if I can't do it
you can't do it.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.481
 Carla, that's ridiculous!
 Not you!

09:42.582 --> 09:44.311
Fair is fair, Turk.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.613
Incidentally, dynamite nectarini.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.620
That man knows his way around nectar.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.086
I used to just look into
my gut and know what to do.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.322
Now I got all this selfdoubt.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.558
Barbie, you got
massive amounts of doubt,

10:00.633 --> 10:04.194
romantically, professionally,
personally. How do you deal with it?

10:04.270 --> 10:08.434
Treadmill, crank the incline up
to 15 and just run through the tears.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.105
Look, Dr. Cox,
I know that you're scared,

10:13.179 --> 10:16.671
but, believe me,
your gut is still there.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.877
You just have to have
the courage to listen to it again.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.715
You really think so?

10:21.787 --> 10:23.345
I know so.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.717
Push thrombolytics.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.820
Thank you, Barbie.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.331
I'm just glad you let me help.

10:35.001 --> 10:38.061
 There's no better feeling
than helping someone out.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.605
Laverne, Dr. Cox made a decision.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.368
He wants to push thrombolytics.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.467
Yeah, I know.
He told me that three hours ago.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.171
What?

10:49.081 --> 10:53.211
Maybe that's why it hurts that much more
when you end up looking like a fool.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.049
This is why the headache
didn't go away.

11:00.126 --> 11:04.085
It's actually pronounced analgesic,
not analgesic, all right?

11:04.196 --> 11:05.857
The pills go in your mouth.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.834
Elliot, do you ever get
déjà vu around here?

11:09.902 --> 11:12.632
Barbie, there you are. Thank God.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.468
Unfortunately, yes.

11:14.573 --> 11:19.067
As you know, I can't make a decision
without your help, so here goes.

11:19.145 --> 11:22.911
On Oprah, there's a story about
Lindsay Lohan's eating disorder,

11:23.015 --> 11:27.577
but on E! there's a story about Lindsay
Lohan's fabulous new Tribeca loft.

11:27.653 --> 11:31.020
Don't get me wrong, I want to watch
something about Lindsay Lohan.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.115
I'm just a little lost here.

11:33.192 --> 11:37.891
FYI, that loft is Lohantastic.
It's vintage Lindsay.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.056
When you walked away
from Mrs. Goldstein

11:40.132 --> 11:42.396
anyone could've thought
you were in trouble.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.403
I had to go the bathroom, Barbie.

11:46.839 --> 11:51.799
People, from now on, if anyone needs
to take a leak, please notify Dr. Reid.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.038
It is a pet peeve of hers.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.611
 "As it is a pet peeve."

11:58.684 --> 12:01.949
 Oh, really? You think that's funny?
 A little bit.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.115
 Carla, Turk's drinking coffee.
 No!

12:05.191 --> 12:08.649
If your pregnant wife can't
have coffee, then you can't.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.329
Please have some sort of nut.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.727
Hazel.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.359
Careful, Turkelton.
First, it's no coffee.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.994
Next thing, she'll want you
in the delivery room,

12:19.071 --> 12:22.006
holding her hands while she pushes
the little bugger out.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.305
My man will be there
when his baby is born.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.278
Of course he will.
It's a different generation.

12:30.583 --> 12:35.452
Know this, 90 percent of all childbirths
are accompanied by an accidental dookie.

12:37.323 --> 12:41.885
Dude, I'd be a mess if I had to give up
my joe. I have a fullblown addiction.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.519
Hopefully, that won't
come back to haunt me.

12:51.036 --> 12:54.597
Where did you get this?
Who taught you how to use this thing?

12:54.707 --> 12:58.074
You, all right?
I learned from watching you!

13:00.613 --> 13:02.513
Damn it, Billy!

13:02.882 --> 13:05.043
At least he's using good beans.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.915
Guess I'm gonna look like
a porn star when I'm older.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.219
Hey, we solved your stupid game.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.759
Yeah, we've been to the libary!

13:14.827 --> 13:18.319
"Brary," Troy. Library.

13:18.397 --> 13:21.230
Two coins that equal 30 cents,
one of them not a nickel?

13:21.300 --> 13:24.133
A penny and...

13:24.203 --> 13:28.299
...a 1972 dime with a Roosevelt
imperfection, today worth exactly...

13:28.374 --> 13:30.137
...twentynine cents.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.771
OK, no.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.712
The correct answer is
a quarter and a nickel.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.545
No, 'cause you said
one of them isn't a nickel.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.085
Right. The other one is.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.281
You lied to me.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.687
It's a riddle.

13:45.891 --> 13:49.327
Oh, your face is red
like a strawbrary.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.590
Don't have kids.

13:54.934 --> 13:58.700
Excuse me, Dr. Reid. I just wanted
to let you know I'm going to pee.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.146
What a jackass.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.682
I hate it that you two
aren't getting along.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.513
I'd get you together to talk,
but you're stubborn.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.519
I'd never be able
to do it on my own.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.852
Well, there is one way.

14:17.923 --> 14:20.289
I don't want to hear
Floating Head Doctor.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.589
Elliot, save it. He's gone.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.463
Fine, fine, fine.
I will apologize to Elliot.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.899
I don't know how
you'll get her to talk to me.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.403
Oh, don't you worry about that.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.735
Body! Get her!

14:37.343 --> 14:39.709
Get a good night's sleep.
Hey, put me down!

14:39.778 --> 14:42.042
I'm talking to a patient here!

14:42.114 --> 14:44.776
 What are you doing? Oh!

14:50.422 --> 14:52.754
Well, she's dead.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.822
Stupid, stupid body!

14:57.463 --> 14:59.431
Oh, you want some of this?

14:59.498 --> 15:00.965
Too slow!

15:01.033 --> 15:02.000
A little late!

15:02.101 --> 15:03.932
Oh, nice try.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.699
J.D., don't worry about it.
I'll handle it.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.237
 Head fight body again?
 They can't get along.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.873
I don't get it.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.178
Turk, what are you doing?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.018
 You can't ride the bike.
 Why not?

15:25.124 --> 15:27.149
It puts too much pressure
on my cervix.

15:27.226 --> 15:30.992
Baby, I don't have a damn cervix!
And how else am I supposed to exercise?

15:31.063 --> 15:33.190
You can do everything that I do.

15:33.265 --> 15:38.032
You can have yogurt, you can listen
to classical music, gently rub my belly.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.128
You know what?

15:40.205 --> 15:42.070
That's it.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.472
What's it?

15:43.542 --> 15:45.271
What do you think you're doing?

15:47.446 --> 15:48.936
You better not open that.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.879
You better not... OK,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.417
but you better not drink it.

15:53.652 --> 15:56.485
Fine, but you better not enjoy it.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.014
Ahh!

16:02.561 --> 16:04.324
Did you just bitchslap my beer?

16:04.430 --> 16:06.261
Are you calling me a bitch?

16:08.434 --> 16:10.698
Yes.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.498
Yes, I am.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.038
Baby, you OK?

16:14.106 --> 16:16.131
I feel funny.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.640
You know,
I've been thinking about it

16:23.716 --> 16:26.685
and only you could go through
all that stuff you did

16:26.752 --> 16:29.983
and come out the other side
the same meanspirited jerk.

16:30.055 --> 16:33.684
Barbie, please. They're about
to show Lindsay's breakfast nook.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.250
In fact, in the five years
that I've been here,

16:36.328 --> 16:39.161
you're the only person
who hasn't changed one bit.

16:39.231 --> 16:42.325
Well, that's not entirely true.
Since the arrival of my son,

16:42.401 --> 16:44.130
I think I've become more patient.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.263
Plus, I can't believe these words
are coming out of my mouth,

16:47.339 --> 16:51.799
I've learned that not all of Newbie's
ideas are completely ridiculous.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.107
Do you love it as much as I do?

16:56.215 --> 17:00.174
Well, with me, you've never been
anything but an unsupportive bastard,

17:00.252 --> 17:01.913
and you know it.

17:06.825 --> 17:10.761
You have it on the chart he called me a
bitch because he wanted to drink, right?

17:11.363 --> 17:13.490
I don't really have
a section for that.

17:13.565 --> 17:16.728
Well, put it under family history,
it's part of ours now.

17:16.835 --> 17:19.998
All you had was a little round
ligament pain. It's common.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.973
I'll meet you outside.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.406
Babe, I'm sorry.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.173
You know what?
This was actually kind of nice.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.682
How was this nice?

17:31.750 --> 17:34.776
You being here with me,
all concerned.

17:35.854 --> 17:39.290
It feels like since I got pregnant,
everything's changing for me,

17:39.358 --> 17:41.326
but nothing is changing for you.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.953
So yes, you can drink.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.793
Just maybe not do it in front of me?

17:47.900 --> 17:52.064
And sometimes, when I'm reading
my pregnancy book,

17:52.137 --> 17:55.004
maybe you can ask me about it?

17:55.074 --> 17:59.704
And occasionally, on a Friday night,
when I'm too tired to go out,

17:59.778 --> 18:03.475
maybe you can stay in
and get fat with me.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.045
I can get fat?

18:06.118 --> 18:08.484
The bigger you get,
the tinier I'll look.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.351
 Oh.
 Come on, come on, please.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.463
How's Mrs. Goldstein doing?

18:18.530 --> 18:19.963
Fine.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.257
OK, lookit.

18:22.367 --> 18:25.734
How's about we act like adults here
and lay our cards on the table?

18:25.804 --> 18:28.932
You know you're not exactly
my favorite person in this dump.

18:29.007 --> 18:32.943
And I say that knowing full well
you feel the same way about me.

18:33.011 --> 18:37.573
I started an "I hate Cox" chat room.
Hasn't worked out the way I planned.

18:37.649 --> 18:40.618
It's me, two interns
and 14,000 lesbians.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.849
How about we just agree that
we're never gonna be that close?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.720
We could, except for one thing.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.556
I know we have our issues,
but I always respected you.

18:49.661 --> 18:53.324
And you haven't given me more than
an ounce of that since I started here.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.169
I didn't go in that bathroom
to take a leak.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.402
I went in because I was petrified

19:03.475 --> 19:07.206
that I was gonna make
the wrong decision about Mrs. Goldstein.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.770
I didn't want anybody to know,

19:09.848 --> 19:14.012
because it is so very important to me
people see me the way they used to.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.582
Bulletproof.

19:19.424 --> 19:22.655
And hopefully, admitting this
to you will make you feel...

19:23.929 --> 19:25.692
...respected.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.127
It does.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.332
Thanks.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.163
You're welcome.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.606
[# The Weepies:
The World Spins Madly On]

19:41.780 --> 19:45.238
 It's understandable
why I've been feeling so much déjà vu.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.682
After five years,

19:46.785 --> 19:50.312
it's hard not to feel like you're
repeating moments week after week.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.153
Gotta run. They're doing
a breast reduction on three,

19:53.225 --> 19:56.854
and I want to get up there and stop it.
You know what I'm talking about!

19:56.929 --> 19:58.453
Son, do you not realize

19:58.530 --> 20:01.988
that you're nothing but
a large pair of scrubs to me?

20:02.067 --> 20:04.331
 So I guess
all you can do is try to notice

20:04.403 --> 20:06.928
the subtle differences
within those moments.

20:07.739 --> 20:11.231
Whether it's Turk's response
to the baby stuff Carla makes him do...

20:11.310 --> 20:14.279
Friday, we meet with
the babyproofer at the apartment.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.040
I can't wait.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.715
... or it not bothering Elliot
when Dr. Cox gives her a hard time.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.312
Barbie, why did you order this test?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.550
For the love of God,
are you a real doctor

20:26.625 --> 20:29.753
or a doctor like
Julius Erving is a doctor?

20:34.299 --> 20:38.759
Of course, sometimes, things are gonna
repeat themselves in the exact same way.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.903
What the hell?

20:42.574 --> 20:46.908
It's a riddle. Two guys destroyed your
bike with a softball bat and a crowbar.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.810
One of them wasn't me.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.283
Oh, that's what happened
to my old bike.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.682
Ha!

20:54.286 --> 20:56.379
 Good day, fellas.
 See you tomorrow.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.552
Troy! This one's over.
