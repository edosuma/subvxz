00:28.570 --> 00:30.322
I don't know
how you saw anything

00:30.364 --> 00:32.073
in this weather,
but thanks a lot.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.576
Thanks.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.080
Guy was on his way
to a landscaping job

00:38.580 --> 00:40.082
in Palm Springs.

00:40.082 --> 00:43.085
Saw a body sticking
out of the sand.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.588
Well, out this far,
it's probably a body dump.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.092
Looks like they starved
her to death first.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.097
Well, Jesus fasted
in the desert.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.599
Yeah, but he had a choice.

00:57.641 --> 00:58.600
No clothes, no shoes,

00:59.101 --> 01:00.602
no hair.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.104
Maybe her dome was shaved

01:02.104 --> 01:04.105
'cause she spent time
in the pen.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.107
No right hand, either.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.108
Could have been

01:06.608 --> 01:08.110
disarticulated
by a wild animal.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.612
The only wild animal was
the one who left her out here.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.614
Hey, Grissom.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.617
Conditions are less than ideal.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.619
Is it okay if we just do
a scoop-and-run?

01:17.661 --> 01:19.121
Yeah, David.

01:19.121 --> 01:22.624
Shoe prints, tire treads-
all they are is...

01:22.666 --> 01:23.625
Dust in the wind.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.635
Looks like she was branded.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.888
Emaciated, bald and numbered.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.639
What does that
remind you of?

01:47.149 --> 01:50.152
? Who... are you??

01:50.152 --> 01:53.155
? Who, who, who, who??

01:53.197 --> 01:56.158
? Who... are you??

01:56.658 --> 01:58.160
? Who, who, who, who??

01:58.202 --> 01:59.661
? I really wanna know?

01:59.912 --> 02:02.164
? Who... are you??

02:02.664 --> 02:03.665
? Oh-oh-oh?
? Who...?

02:04.166 --> 02:07.669
? Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

02:08.169 --> 02:11.173
? Oh, you!?

02:14.676 --> 02:16.178
Branding.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.680
A brand is a kind
of contract.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.182
Tell that to a bull

02:20.182 --> 02:22.184
when he gets stuck on
his rear with a hot iron.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.686
In that case,
it signifies ownership.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.688
To a Maori tribesman,
or a Marine,

02:27.189 --> 02:28.440
it signifies belonging.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.691
Did you get a liver temp?

02:29.691 --> 02:30.692
Couldn't get
an accurate reading.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.194
You want me to pull
vitreous from the eye?

02:32.236 --> 02:34.196
Yeah.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.197
One eye is much more desiccated
than the other.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.199
Could be an infection.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.700
Take samples from both.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.703
The eye is
sequestered space.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.705
Changes that happen
in the blood after death

02:43.747 --> 02:45.207
happen more slowly
in the vitreous.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.209
Could give us
more accurate levels.

02:57.719 --> 03:02.224
Um... Dr. Robbins...

03:02.224 --> 03:04.726
Well, the optic nerve's
been severed.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.228
That kind of defeats the purpose

03:06.728 --> 03:08.230
of an eye transplant,
doesn't it?

03:08.230 --> 03:09.731
Well, an eye transplant's
just the cornea;

03:09.773 --> 03:11.233
it's not the whole eye.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.735
David, check
the other eye.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.743
This one's
still connected.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.744
Clip it.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.246
Nick, send both eyes

03:24.288 --> 03:26.748
to DNA.
Yeah.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.267
? I keep slipping away?

03:45.309 --> 03:47.269
? Away, away?

03:47.769 --> 03:50.272
? I keep slipping away?

03:50.314 --> 03:51.773
? Away, away?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.775
? I keep slipping away?

03:53.775 --> 03:57.279
? Keep slipping, keep slipping,
keep slipping?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.281
? I keep slipping away?

03:59.281 --> 04:02.284
? Keep slipping, keep slipping,
keep slipping?

04:02.326 --> 04:05.287
? I keep slipping away?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.789
? Keep slipping away?

04:11.793 --> 04:14.796
? My self keeps slipping away?

04:14.838 --> 04:17.298
? Slipping away?

04:17.298 --> 04:20.802
? My self keeps slipping away?

04:20.844 --> 04:22.804
? Slipping away?

04:22.804 --> 04:25.307
? My self keeps slipping
away...?

04:27.809 --> 04:28.810
Pull up a chair.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.312
It's been a
long, strange trip

04:30.354 --> 04:31.313
for this poor girl.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.816
I found puncture wounds
around her glandular areas,

04:34.858 --> 04:36.318
from large-gauge needles
commonly used

04:36.818 --> 04:38.320
to draw out fluids.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.321
Maybe she was undergoing

04:39.321 --> 04:41.323
some kind of medical treatment.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.824
What's in this?

04:42.866 --> 04:43.825
sure.
I'm not

04:44.326 --> 04:45.327
I found it in her teeth.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.870
Could be from her last meal.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.330
Also, anot
her surprise:

04:48.372 --> 04:49.331
She had a D & C.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.332
Abortion?

04:50.332 --> 04:52.334
Well, maybe polyps, hyperplasia.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.336
Infection?
And how.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.338
Starvation shrinks
a lot of things,

04:56.380 --> 04:57.840
but not your organs.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.844
They're all abscessed.

05:01.844 --> 05:04.346
Yeah, which explains why
I couldn't find the liver.

05:04.388 --> 05:05.848
There's not much left.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.350
What, some kind
of flesh-eating disease?

05:08.392 --> 05:10.352
Necrotizing faciitis.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.854
I've never seen
anything like this.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.857
Typically, streptococcus enters
through an open wound

05:14.898 --> 05:16.900
and starts eating
through the skin,

05:16.942 --> 05:18.861
then uses the bloodstream
as a conduit

05:18.902 --> 05:20.863
to reach the internal organs.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.867
But in her case,
the bacteria started

05:24.908 --> 05:26.368
in her bloodstream;

05:26.869 --> 05:28.370
hence her skin is fine.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.874
Maybe the puncture wounds
were used to put something in

05:31.915 --> 05:34.376
rather than take something out.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.378
So Henry found oxycodone
and chlorpromazine

05:36.879 --> 05:38.380
in both the right
and left eye.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.381
Now, one kills pain

05:39.381 --> 05:41.383
and the other puts
a lid on panic.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.886
Chlorpromazine- they give
that to mental patients.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.888
Yeah, but this gets
so much weirder,

05:46.388 --> 05:47.890
because that
dried-up eyeball-

05:47.890 --> 05:49.892
it actually belongs
to somebody else.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.393
What?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.896
See, the vitreous fluid
from her eyeball showed

05:53.937 --> 05:55.439
that she'd only been dead
for a day;

05:55.480 --> 05:56.899
but the DNA
from the other eyeball-

05:56.899 --> 05:59.401
well, it was male, and it seems
to have been separated

05:59.443 --> 06:00.903
from its owner for about a week.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.655
So I ran it
through CODIS,

06:03.697 --> 06:05.908
and the eyeball
belonged

06:05.949 --> 06:06.909
to a Jack Landers,

06:07.409 --> 06:09.912
who is a convicted
sex offender.

06:09.912 --> 06:13.415
Would sticking your eyeball
in a woman's eye socket

06:13.457 --> 06:15.209
constitute a sex offense?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.919
Well, rape is legally defined

06:16.919 --> 06:20.923
as putting an unwanted foreign
object into a genital opening,

06:20.964 --> 06:23.425
so sexual... no...

06:23.425 --> 06:26.929
But offensive... yeah.
Yeah.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.431
Look, guy got out of jail
six weeks ago.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.433
A weenie wagger
with two eyes.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.436
As a parolee, he has to check
in with me once a month.

06:34.478 --> 06:35.938
Missed our last
appointment,

06:35.938 --> 06:37.439
but before I could file
the paperwork,

06:37.439 --> 06:39.942
he showed up here,
across from his halfway house,

06:39.983 --> 06:41.443
thinking he's
Captain Crunch.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.447
They thought he was
piped up on something,

06:45.489 --> 06:46.990
but his urine
was clean

06:47.032 --> 06:48.450
and his high
hasn't faded.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.452
Hey, Jack.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.455
Captain Jack to you.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.460
Ahoy, mateys.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.962
Captain Jack,
these people want

07:00.462 --> 07:02.464
to ask you
some questions.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.466
Orphaned at the age of five.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.970
Stowed away on...
theGood Ship Lollipop.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.972
The sea...

07:09.972 --> 07:13.475
is an evil mistress.

07:14.977 --> 07:18.480
Spit me out and fed me
to the beast.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.487
A puppet I am.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.247
Hey, Sara, got your message.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.499
No AFIS hits
on my Jane Doe,

07:37.499 --> 07:40.002
so I put a bulletin out to
surrounding agencies and the media.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.504
Maybe somebody will
recognize her from the photo.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.505
Where you at right now?

07:43.505 --> 07:45.507
On the train
to Crazyville.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.509
Did you get a peek
under the patch?

07:48.010 --> 07:49.011
No, no, no, no.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.804
I, uh, left that

07:50.846 --> 07:52.514
for the doctor.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.017
Jack, look
this way.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.019
Okay, Jack, I need y ou to sit
still for me. Where's my patch?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.021
Come on, look this way.
Draw me sword...

07:59.062 --> 08:01.023
make you walk the plank.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.026
Jack, were you
in an accident

08:04.067 --> 08:05.527
or a recent fight?

08:05.527 --> 08:09.531
Captain Jack...
don't do much recallin'.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.034
Did he have an ocular tumor
or recent surgery?

08:12.075 --> 08:14.036
I have no idea.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.537
He's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.332
Do you think
he's crazy, or...?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.459
I think he's been lobotomized.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.544
Jack, I want
you to undress

08:23.045 --> 08:24.046
and put this
on for me.

08:24.046 --> 08:27.049
I want to do a
CT scan to confirm,

08:27.090 --> 08:28.550
but in the
'30s and '40s,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.053
lobotomies were often
done via the eye socket.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.554
Right, right, but lobotomies-
they're not

08:33.597 --> 08:35.057
a common practice
today?

08:35.097 --> 08:36.600
Hardly.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.059
Nick...

08:38.059 --> 08:40.562
take a look
at his arm.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.068
He's not a suspect;
he's a victim.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.572
Jane Doe is number 19.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.078
I know it's tough,

08:56.578 --> 08:57.579
but we're going
 to need you

08:57.621 --> 08:59.581
to identify
the body.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.083
Fine.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.084
Someone from the
coroner's office

09:02.125 --> 09:03.585
will get in
touch with you.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.088
For reasons I think
we both understand,

09:06.129 --> 09:08.090
I would appreciate
some level of anonymity.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.093
Sure, I'll do my best.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.596
Thank you,
Captain Brass.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.598
Thanks for comingin.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.123
The, um...

09:41.123 --> 09:42.624
the Jane Doe
is Zoe Kessler.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.626
Her mother saw her
picture on the news

09:45.127 --> 09:47.129
and identified her as
her estranged daughter.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.131
I did a DMV check,

09:49.131 --> 09:51.133
and I have the victim's
last known address.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.634
Good. I'll come with you.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.886
There's some
thing you should know.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.137
The mother's a
friend of yours.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.430
Who's that?

09:56.471 --> 09:57.639
Lady Heather.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.151
Apartment 106.

10:09.651 --> 10:13.155
Landlord was getting
ready to evict her.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.680
"Freud, Goethe...

10:40.682 --> 10:43.185
Rilke... " in German.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.437
Briefe an einen jungen Dichter.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.689
Nothing sounds good in German.

10:49.191 --> 10:52.194
How did she get
from Harvard to here?

10:52.236 --> 10:54.196
Practice, practice, practice.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.698
How do you know
she was at Harvard?

10:56.740 --> 10:58.200
Lady Heather told me.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.201
She was very proud of her.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.705
Well, it looks as though

11:03.705 --> 11:05.707
she hasn't checked her mail
in ten weeks.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.709
The postmark dates back
to November 12th.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.211
She died yesterday.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.213
Where's she been all this time?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.216
This looks like an appointment.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.718
"Betz, 11-12, 7:00 P.M."

11:16.760 --> 11:19.221
First message:

11:19.221 --> 11:21.223
Hi, this is Audrey
at the Betz Clinic.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.225
We're calling
to see how you're feeling.

11:23.725 --> 11:24.977
Give us a call.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.228
Second message:

11:26.228 --> 11:27.729
Hi, this is Audrey
from the Betz Clinic.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.231
We didn't hear from you.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.732
We have some follow-up
questions about your tests.

11:30.774 --> 11:31.733
Please call us.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.236

11:34.278 --> 11:36.238
This is Citibank.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.239
We're trying
to reach Zoe Kessler.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.740
Betz Clinic?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.242
Yeah. I'll check it out.

11:40.242 --> 11:44.746
...at 1-800-555-0199
at extension...

11:44.788 --> 11:46.248
Heterochromia.

11:46.248 --> 11:51.253
It appears Zoe had one blue eye
and one brown eye.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.754
The pirate had one blue eye.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.772
What happened to her?

12:10.772 --> 12:12.774
We're trying
to find out.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.781
May I touch her?

12:20.282 --> 12:21.783
Go ahead.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.800
This required skill...

12:38.800 --> 12:41.803
and the infliction of pain.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.809
Did you shave her head?

12:47.809 --> 12:50.812
No, she was found like this.

12:50.812 --> 12:55.317
Can you tell
if she's ever given birth?

12:55.317 --> 12:58.320
There was some scarring
on her pelvic bones,

12:58.362 --> 13:00.322
but given the condition
of the body,

13:00.364 --> 13:02.324
it's hard to say for sure.

13:02.324 --> 13:05.327
She always wore her
grandmother's ring

13:05.827 --> 13:08.330
on her right hand.

13:08.831 --> 13:09.832
Did you find it?

13:18.340 --> 13:19.842
Hi.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.348
I'm so sorry
about your loss.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.351
But you need to ask me
some questions.

13:29.351 --> 13:33.355
I'd like to know some things
about your daughter.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.858
When was the last
time you saw her?

13:35.858 --> 13:38.861
She dropped out of school
about a year ago.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.613
I didn't even know
she was in town.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.866
So you weren't in contact
with her?

13:44.366 --> 13:44.867
No.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.368
Can you tell me why?

13:46.368 --> 13:48.370
What difference
does it make now?

13:53.876 --> 13:55.878
Did she have any
medical conditions?

13:55.919 --> 13:58.422
Not that I know of.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.883
Because in November,

14:01.383 --> 14:03.385
she participated
in a medical study

14:03.427 --> 14:05.888
at the Betz Clinic.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.892
Right after that,
she went missing.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.393
Where was she found?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.896
In the desert.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.398
Just out in the middle
of nowhere?

14:16.440 --> 14:20.402
Off Highway 55, near Sparks.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.409
I have to go.

14:33.415 --> 14:37.920
Betz Pharmaceutical.
Can you hold, please?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.922
Thank you. Betz Pharmaceutical.
Can I help you?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.924
He's on the line right now.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.426
May I take a message?
And your phone number?

14:44.927 --> 14:47.429
Here are the files on Zoe
Kessler that you asked for

14:47.471 --> 14:49.431
in the warrant,
along with a list

14:49.431 --> 14:51.433
of everyone who was here
on November 12th.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.935
Including the employees?

14:52.935 --> 14:55.437
Yeah. The nighttime staff's
pretty minimal.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.438
I was supervising that night.

14:56.939 --> 14:57.940
What brought Zoe in?

14:57.981 --> 14:58.941
Chronic insomnia.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.943
She came in for an overnight
sleep study

15:00.984 --> 15:01.944
but left early.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.445
Was there a problem?

15:03.445 --> 15:06.448
No. Some people just get
freaked out spending the night

15:06.490 --> 15:07.491
in a strange place.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.450
Happens all the time.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.452
We'll need to see
those testing rooms.

15:10.953 --> 15:11.954
Okay.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.457
As you can see, we try

15:15.457 --> 15:17.709
to make the facility as normal
as possible.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.962
Put a TV in there,
it wouldn't be half bad.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.463
But that would defeat
the purpose.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.966
We can't have anything
in there that would reveal

15:24.007 --> 15:24.967
the actual time.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.470
How do you monitor
your patients?

15:28.512 --> 15:31.473
Our monitoring process
is two fold.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.725
Electrodes measure EKG
and REM sleep,

15:33.767 --> 15:35.477
and we have a vid
cam in the room

15:35.477 --> 15:37.479
to help insure the patients
actually stay in bed.

15:37.521 --> 15:40.482
You worried
about hanky-panky?

15:40.524 --> 15:41.483
Sleepwalking.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.485
After the meds
are distributed,

15:43.485 --> 15:45.988
we ask that the patients
assume a sleep-ready position.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.781
Many people assume
they have insomnia

15:47.823 --> 15:49.491
simply because they
don't get in bed.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.994
What is your
screening process?

15:52.494 --> 15:53.495
It's intensive.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.497
There's a written
application,

15:55.497 --> 15:57.749
a personal interview,
physical exam.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.668
We only take people
in the normal range.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.503
You'd be surprised
how many people just want

16:02.004 --> 16:05.007
a pharmaceutical lullaby
these days.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.508
No, I wouldn't.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.013
This clinic is like
Hotel California:

16:11.054 --> 16:13.015
You can check in
any time you like,

16:13.515 --> 16:15.017
but you might
never leave.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.518
Zoe Kessler and
Captain Jack

16:16.518 --> 16:18.520
were part of the same
sleep study.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.522
How many other people
in the sleep study?

16:20.564 --> 16:21.523
A dozen.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.025
I have called all of them
on the list.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.777
They're intact, and none
of them are numbered.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.530
Zoe's car was found
at an impound lot downtown.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.533
It was towed from Betz's
parking lot on November 15th.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.535
Wolfowitz said Zoe
left in the middle

16:33.577 --> 16:35.037
of the night
on the 13th.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.038
With Captain Jack?

16:36.079 --> 16:37.039
I don't know,

16:37.539 --> 16:38.540
but according
to their records,

16:39.041 --> 16:40.042
he also left early.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.044
"Left early" seems
to be a euphemism.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.546
I got the results for the sinew
in the girl's teeth,

16:44.588 --> 16:47.549
and in this case,
the hand that feeds...

16:48.050 --> 16:49.051
was her own.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.552
She chewed off
her own hand?

16:50.552 --> 16:53.055
Yeah. Now, I don't know about
you, but I would rather die

16:53.096 --> 16:55.098
of starvation
than to eat my own hand.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.059
Animals in traps
do it all the time.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.560
You think she was trapped?

16:58.602 --> 17:00.062
Like a rat.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.568
A hand in the desert
is worth two in the bush.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.570
Right now, the hand's
all we have to go on.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.573
Okay, Grissom.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.824
Come on.
What are we doing here?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.076
What are the odds
that this hand is

17:14.576 --> 17:15.828
not being eaten
right now by a coyote?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.246
Hey, look, the condition
she was in,

17:17.287 --> 17:18.579
she couldn't
have gotten very far.

17:19.080 --> 17:19.580
Maybe if we find
the hand,

17:20.082 --> 17:22.584
we find
the torture chamber.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.585
Torture chamber?

17:23.585 --> 17:25.587
All right, everybody
gather around.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.589
Let me have your attention.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.592
We're going to proceed forward
covering the immediate area

17:31.093 --> 17:33.095
bordering the road
to the south,

17:33.095 --> 17:36.598
the rocks to the west and
the dry creek bed to the east.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.150
Oh, you smell decomp?

18:28.650 --> 18:29.651
I do.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.667
You think the hand
is in that pile?

18:46.168 --> 18:47.669
Maybe.

18:48.170 --> 18:48.670
Let's get a sample.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.676
Whoo!

18:55.677 --> 18:58.180
Whew!

18:58.180 --> 19:00.682
The smell's coming
from these plants.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.687
"Amorphophallus Titanum,

19:05.729 --> 19:08.690
Corpse Flower. "

19:08.690 --> 19:10.692
Now who's going to have a plant

19:10.692 --> 19:12.194
that smells
like decomposing flesh?

19:12.194 --> 19:14.696
Somebody who's trying
to cover up the real deal.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.199
LVPD!

19:19.201 --> 19:21.203
You smell a warrant?

19:21.203 --> 19:23.705
We can look
but not touch.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.707
I'm in if you're in.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.710
All right,
here's the real catch-22.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.712
If we open it up,
find something probative,

19:30.754 --> 19:31.713
we can't use it.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.715
But we can't find something
probative...

19:33.757 --> 19:35.717
...unless we got the warrant
to open it.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.219
Yeah.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.720
That's funny,
you don't strike me

19:38.762 --> 19:40.222
as the delayed gratification
type.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.224
I'm not.
Grissom is.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.226
Right.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.236
There are some freaky-looking
plants in here.

19:54.278 --> 19:57.239
Yeah, it's all about
genetic modification.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.242
Well, if this is where they
genetically modify the plants,

20:00.742 --> 20:03.245
there's got to be a house
around here somewhere.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.770
"Jacob Wolfowitz. "

20:29.271 --> 20:30.772
Isn't that the same guy
from the Betz Clinic?

20:30.814 --> 20:32.274
Yeah.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.280
Mr. Wolfowitz?

20:38.280 --> 20:39.781
Mr. Wolfowitz, come out of there now.

20:39.823 --> 20:40.782
We're from
the Crime Lab.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.284
We need to speak
with you.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.785
We can hear you, sir.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.287
Just open the door.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.295
He's not home.

21:01.845 --> 21:04.348
Are you and Mr.
Wolfowitz acquainted?

21:04.389 --> 21:05.807
No.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.351
Why were you
at his house?

21:07.851 --> 21:09.353
Breaking and entering.

21:12.356 --> 21:15.859
Is that why we found
this etching in your handbag?

21:15.901 --> 21:17.361
You were stealingit?

21:17.402 --> 21:19.363
Yes.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.323
Why?

21:21.365 --> 21:22.866
Multiple reasons.

21:22.908 --> 21:23.867
Which are?

21:24.368 --> 21:26.829
You told me Zoe was
having tests done at Betz.

21:26.870 --> 21:31.875
I found out who oversaw the tests
- Mr. Wolfowitz.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.378
He lives close
to where you found Zoe.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.839
If I'm caught stealing,

21:36.880 --> 21:39.383
he may want the police
to investigate.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.388
We know the woman
who broke into your house,

21:44.429 --> 21:46.390
and you don't want
to press charges?

21:46.431 --> 21:48.892
She's clearly disturbed.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.353
She just lost her daughter,

21:51.395 --> 21:53.397
and I was one of the last people

21:53.438 --> 21:54.857
to see Zoe Kessler alive.

21:54.898 --> 22:00.404
I'm sure she was just
looking for a connection.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.905
You don't want us
to look around,

22:01.947 --> 22:03.407
see if anything else
was stolen?

22:03.448 --> 22:04.908
I live pretty simply,

22:05.409 --> 22:07.411
and I don't have
anything worth taking,

22:07.452 --> 22:10.372
but I appreciate
your concern.

22:10.414 --> 22:14.418
However, if he refuses
to press charges...

22:14.918 --> 22:17.921
I'd have to ask myself what
kind of person would do that.

22:17.963 --> 22:19.923
Someone with something to hide.

22:20.424 --> 22:21.925
Precisely.

22:25.429 --> 22:27.431
Why, uh, steal this?

22:27.931 --> 22:29.433
It's one of the earliest
illustrations

22:29.933 --> 22:31.685
of the Romulus and Remus myth.

22:31.727 --> 22:33.061
It's printed from a plate.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.438
Must be worth thousands.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.899
So?

22:36.940 --> 22:39.693
Well, it looks like
a page from a book.

22:39.735 --> 22:42.404
I find that people
who don't respect books

22:42.446 --> 22:45.449
have a general disregard
for keeping things whole.

22:45.491 --> 22:47.409
So you think he stole it?

22:47.451 --> 22:49.953
I think a pencil pusher
in a pharmaceutical lab

22:49.995 --> 22:51.455
couldn't afford it.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.957
How long have you
worked at Betz?

22:54.458 --> 22:55.959
18... 18 years.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.921
18 years. Oh.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.464
But that's a long way
from your home

23:00.506 --> 23:01.465
to your office,
isn't it?

23:01.965 --> 23:06.470
I like the solitude
and, uh, space for my plants.

23:09.473 --> 23:12.976
Did I do something wrong,
Captain?

23:13.018 --> 23:14.436
Even if all this is true,

23:14.478 --> 23:17.981
we still don't know
if he killed your daughter.

23:18.023 --> 23:19.942
Too many coincidences.

23:19.983 --> 23:23.445
You have to stay away from him.

23:23.487 --> 23:29.993
You forfeited the right to give
me advice some time ago.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.995
But thank you.

23:54.518 --> 23:57.271
Ah, I believe this is authentic.

23:57.312 --> 24:00.023
Iron-gall ink
from the 16th century

24:00.065 --> 24:01.984
tends to turn a brownish color.

24:02.025 --> 24:04.027
Especially when it's
been sitting around

24:04.069 --> 24:05.529
for a few centuries.

24:09.032 --> 24:12.536
See how the ink bites
into the parchment of the page.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.538
Is that an acidic compound?

24:15.038 --> 24:17.499
Gall inks are often made
with wine or vinegar.

24:17.541 --> 24:21.044
Recipes were specific
to the manuscript illuminator.

24:21.545 --> 24:25.048
So it is from a manuscript?

24:28.051 --> 24:30.512
The edge appears
fairly pristine.

24:30.554 --> 24:33.557
How could he remove it
from the book so cleanly?

24:34.057 --> 24:37.561
My guess?
Classic spit and string.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.525
You use saliva.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.069
It's absorbed
into the fabric of the paper

24:46.111 --> 24:48.572
and softens its fibers.

24:56.079 --> 24:58.832
Even if this tests positive
for DNA,

24:58.874 --> 25:01.543
I'm gonna need the book
to match it.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.588
Here's Zoe Kessler
at the start of her session.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.594
And here she is
at hour number four.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.598
Well, she doesn't
look freaked out.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.600
Looks like she's
sleeping like a baby.

25:16.642 --> 25:18.101
Except...

25:18.143 --> 25:19.561
Check it out.

25:19.603 --> 25:23.106
Okay, so she gets up...

25:23.148 --> 25:25.067
gets out.

25:25.108 --> 25:28.111
Look at the bottom
right hand corner.

25:32.616 --> 25:33.575
See that shadow?

25:33.617 --> 25:35.118
Somebody opened the door.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.621
Well, she didn't just
pop out of bed,

25:38.121 --> 25:39.373
she was woken up by someone.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.582
How much you
want to bet

25:40.624 --> 25:41.625
that's Wolfowitz in the doorway?

25:44.628 --> 25:46.588
Here's Jack Landers.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.632
A trip to the bathroom, maybe?

25:48.674 --> 25:51.093
Except he never returned.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.636
Wolfowitz works at the clinic.

25:52.678 --> 25:54.096
He has access to both victims.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.640
One victim is found
less than mile from his house,

25:57.140 --> 25:59.142
which smells
like human decomp.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.144
How do we get to him?

26:01.645 --> 26:03.105
Rambar checked

26:03.146 --> 26:04.606
rare book collections.

26:04.648 --> 26:06.149
This guy likes to steal
in his own backyard.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.902
UNLV library
is missing plate 62.

26:08.944 --> 26:11.154
It's enough for us
to get a warrant.

26:15.659 --> 26:17.119
He's never missed work.

26:17.161 --> 26:19.163
So, I left him a couple
of messages at home.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.915
And when I left
for the day,

26:21.957 --> 26:23.792
I just saw him
like that.

26:23.834 --> 26:25.669
I didn't
know what to do.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.176
I guess I didn't need a warrant.

26:41.185 --> 26:44.688
No signs of trauma or blood.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.190
The seat's wet.

26:48.192 --> 26:49.193
He's wet.

26:52.696 --> 26:54.156
Looks like he's in rigor,

26:54.198 --> 26:56.700
which means he's been
dead for at least six hours.

26:57.201 --> 26:58.702
You mean this guy's
been down here

26:59.203 --> 27:01.205
in the parking lot dead
all that time

27:01.246 --> 27:02.206
and no one noticed?

27:02.247 --> 27:04.208
That's weird.

27:49.253 --> 27:50.712
Still frozen?

27:50.754 --> 27:53.257
I'm not gonna be able
to determine COD

27:53.298 --> 27:54.758
until he's completely
defrosted,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.218
and that could take a while.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.762
How long does it take
to freeze an entire body?

27:58.804 --> 27:59.763
To the core?

28:00.264 --> 28:01.223
Two solid days.

28:01.265 --> 28:03.767
His heart's completely frozen.

28:04.268 --> 28:05.727
Before the Y,
I found bruises

28:05.769 --> 28:08.272
and puncture wounds
all over his body.

28:08.313 --> 28:09.273
Over the glands, too?

28:09.773 --> 28:11.275
Yep. Same as Zoe.

28:11.316 --> 28:12.276
So is this.

28:14.278 --> 28:16.780
Test subject #1.

28:18.782 --> 28:20.242
Gil, I saw him.

28:20.284 --> 28:22.035
Yesterday.
He wasn't frozen.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.745
I mean, maybe
he knew too much,

28:23.787 --> 28:26.790
and someone at Betz sensed that
we were getting too close and...

28:26.832 --> 28:28.292
So what? They dunked him
in liquid nitrogen?

28:28.333 --> 28:30.043
Cryogenically froze him?

28:30.085 --> 28:31.753
Well, I know
what I saw.

28:31.795 --> 28:34.298
You've got to find
some explanation.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.300
I'm on it.

28:48.312 --> 28:49.813
What are you doing here?

28:50.314 --> 28:52.816
I think I might be able
to help you.

28:52.858 --> 28:54.818
I'm listening.

28:58.822 --> 29:01.074
You would have liked Zoe.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.285
She was a lot like you.

29:03.327 --> 29:06.079
Thoughtful,
pragmatic, patient.

29:06.121 --> 29:08.832
She was studying
psychology.

29:09.333 --> 29:13.337
I appreciate that it would
have been difficult

29:13.378 --> 29:16.340
to have someone like me
as a mother.

29:16.381 --> 29:18.300
But if I stressed anything,

29:18.342 --> 29:20.302
it was empowerment
and independence.

29:20.344 --> 29:24.306
So when she called
me from Boston last year

29:24.348 --> 29:27.351
to tell me that she was pregnant
with her therapist's baby,

29:27.392 --> 29:29.311
I got angry.

29:29.353 --> 29:31.855
Not with her, with him.

29:31.897 --> 29:34.316
He violated an oath.

29:34.358 --> 29:38.320
Not only was he married,
she was a patient.

29:38.362 --> 29:42.366
A junior in college with her
whole life in front of her.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.369
And you didn't want him
to screw it up.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.372
I called the AMA,
filed a complaint.

29:48.413 --> 29:51.625
They revoked his license.

29:51.667 --> 29:54.878
Zoe stopped speaking to me.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.839
Did she have her baby?

29:56.880 --> 29:59.883
Your coroner couldn't confirm.

30:03.387 --> 30:07.891
I assumed you might need
a DNA sample from Mr. Wolfowitz.

30:12.896 --> 30:14.356
How did you get this?

30:14.398 --> 30:17.401
The rage was stron
ger than the repulsion.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.905
People have used sex for
much less worthy causes.

30:25.409 --> 30:26.410
When did you...

30:26.910 --> 30:28.412
Last night.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.875
You may not approve, Grissom,

30:32.916 --> 30:35.419
but you can't arrest
me for sleeping with him.

30:35.919 --> 30:38.380
He was consenting.

30:38.422 --> 30:40.924
I am playing
by your rules.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.885
But if I had it my way,

30:42.926 --> 30:45.929
this man would die the
same way my daughter died.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.932
He's already dead.

30:49.433 --> 30:50.893
What?

30:50.934 --> 30:52.936
He's been dead for two days.

30:52.978 --> 30:55.439
That's not possible.

31:58.502 --> 32:00.254
The dirt from
outside the barn

32:00.295 --> 32:01.964
tested positive
for human DNA.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.508
And I mean a lot of it,
over a dozen profiles.

32:04.550 --> 32:07.010
And one of them
matched Zoe Kessler.

32:07.052 --> 32:08.971
Her hand.

32:09.012 --> 32:11.515
And although chain of cust
ody is a bit problematic,

32:11.557 --> 32:12.516
'cause a plastic lunch bag

32:13.016 --> 32:14.476
isn't really
a department issue bindle,

32:14.518 --> 32:17.020
the DNA from the condom,
it matches both the saliva

32:17.062 --> 32:19.523
from the book page
and the dead guy,

32:19.565 --> 32:21.024
Jacob Wolfowitz.

32:22.526 --> 32:23.527
Thanks.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.529
I have a question.

32:26.029 --> 32:29.032
How do you have sex with the guy
who killed your daughter?

32:29.074 --> 32:31.535
Revenge is an act of passion.

32:42.045 --> 32:44.506
So, none of the fingerprints

32:44.548 --> 32:47.551
from the car belong
to Jacob Wolfowitz.

32:47.593 --> 32:50.554
They're all a match
to a Leon Sneller.

32:50.596 --> 32:51.513
Who?

32:51.555 --> 32:53.015
That's Leon Sneller.

32:53.056 --> 32:55.517
Looks like Wolfowitz,
only younger.

32:55.559 --> 32:58.562
Which explains how I saw
and how Lady Heather...

32:58.604 --> 33:00.564
did a dead guy.

33:00.606 --> 33:02.524
Identical twins.

33:02.566 --> 33:04.568
I thought that
she killed him, too.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.528
I would've.

33:06.570 --> 33:09.573
I mean, I wouldn't have
slept with him first, but...

33:09.615 --> 33:11.033
Same DNA, different prints.

33:11.074 --> 33:13.577
So all the DNA that we
attributed to Wolfowitz

33:13.619 --> 33:15.037
could be Sneller's.

33:15.078 --> 33:17.080
Which makes you wonder
who's on the autopsy table.

33:18.582 --> 33:21.043
Sneller joined the Army in 1985.

33:21.084 --> 33:23.587
He was stationed at
a field hospital near Berlin

33:23.629 --> 33:25.088
until about a year ago.

33:26.089 --> 33:29.092
At which point, I think
that he came to Vegas...

33:32.596 --> 33:34.598
...put his brother
on ice...

33:34.640 --> 33:36.099
started impersonating him.

33:36.141 --> 33:37.601
Good morning,
Mr. Wolfowitz.

33:37.643 --> 33:38.602
Good morning.

33:39.102 --> 33:41.104
I mean, I know this theory's
a little out there,

33:41.146 --> 33:42.105
but given the evidence...

33:42.606 --> 33:44.608
it's the only conclusion
that makes any sense.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.069
Occam's razor,
principle of parsimony.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.613
If you hear hoofbeats,
think horses, not zebras.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.365
Given twins...

33:51.406 --> 33:53.116
go with twins.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.127
Everything is code four.

34:08.130 --> 34:11.592
Central, this is two Baker 16.

34:11.635 --> 34:14.638
Incident number four-three-four-
eight-six is code four.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.139
Well, this isn't
a torture chamber,

34:16.639 --> 34:18.141
it's a time capsule.

34:18.641 --> 34:21.143
Wolfowitz inherited this
place from his parents.

34:21.186 --> 34:23.897
Took over the deed
about ten years ago.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.650
Love what he's done
with the place.

34:30.654 --> 34:32.614
I found a blue pill in the car.

34:32.656 --> 34:36.659
Tox came back, didn't match
any known pharmaceutical.

34:36.702 --> 34:39.163
Sampling the company candy.

34:54.178 --> 34:57.681
Shabbat shalom.

34:57.723 --> 34:58.682
Jewish?

35:11.695 --> 35:13.197
Well.

36:18.762 --> 36:23.767
It appears he was meticulously
documenting experiments.

36:23.809 --> 36:28.272
This one looks like it
deals with craniometry.

36:28.313 --> 36:30.774
I think he was
measuring skulls

36:30.816 --> 36:32.276
to determine intelligence.

36:32.776 --> 36:35.279
I think this is
a gynecological device

36:35.320 --> 36:36.780
from a hundred years ago.

36:40.284 --> 36:42.786
"Arbeit macht frei. "

36:42.828 --> 36:45.247
Work will set you free.

36:45.289 --> 36:49.293
These words hung over
the gates at Auschwitz.

36:49.793 --> 36:51.253
Zoe Kessler

36:51.295 --> 36:53.297
would've made
the perfect uberwoman

36:53.338 --> 36:55.299
except for her one brown eye.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.758
So I guess, uh,

36:56.800 --> 36:58.760
what nature couldn't fix,

36:58.802 --> 37:01.805
our Dr. Mengele could,
is that it?

37:01.847 --> 37:04.808
Hey, check out the face
of the clock.

37:08.312 --> 37:10.814
No numbers.

37:34.838 --> 37:36.840
Sir?

37:38.342 --> 37:40.344
Sir?

37:49.853 --> 37:52.356
I'll call a paramedic.

37:57.861 --> 37:59.363
This one's dead.

38:06.870 --> 38:08.372
Massive blood loss
was the cause of death.

38:08.872 --> 38:10.833
Hey, Catherine.

38:10.874 --> 38:12.376
So Brass has put the
lockdown on the airport,

38:12.417 --> 38:14.378
bus depot
and train station.

38:14.419 --> 38:15.879
But so far, no Sneller.

38:17.381 --> 38:18.882
Well, the other twin
didn't make it.

38:18.924 --> 38:20.843
Well, speaking of twins,

38:20.884 --> 38:21.885
we got a call fr
om Social Services.

38:21.927 --> 38:23.887
Sneller was
their birth name.

38:23.929 --> 38:25.347
But they were adopted

38:25.389 --> 38:26.890
by a Jewish couple
named Wolfowitz.

38:28.892 --> 38:31.353
That explains the Judaica.

38:31.395 --> 38:35.399
I guess Jacob went nurture
and Leon went nature.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.860
Maybe he went Nazi,

38:37.901 --> 38:40.404
trying to kill the Jewish
half of himself.

38:54.418 --> 38:57.921
"Those who want to live,
let them fight,

38:57.963 --> 38:59.423
"and those who do not
want to fight

38:59.923 --> 39:01.425
"in this world
of eternal struggle

39:01.925 --> 39:04.428
do not deserve to live. "

39:10.434 --> 39:12.436
"The only difference
between my research

39:12.477 --> 39:14.438
"and that of the government
is funding.

39:14.938 --> 39:17.900
"See: Tuskegee.
See: U.S. Naval Hospital.

39:17.941 --> 39:21.445
See: pesticide testing
done by U.S. government. "

40:27.010 --> 40:28.971
Copy that, we're gonna reroute.

40:29.012 --> 40:31.515
Uh, let 'em know we'll be there
in about five minutes.

40:44.027 --> 40:46.530
Have you guys secured
the entire perimeter?

40:46.572 --> 40:48.031
The house and the barn?

40:48.073 --> 40:49.533
Yes, sir.
All clear.

41:48.592 --> 41:49.843
Heather!

41:49.885 --> 41:51.094
Stop it!

41:51.136 --> 41:52.554
No.

41:52.596 --> 41:54.097
Let me finish.

41:58.101 --> 41:59.102
You cannot do this!

41:59.144 --> 42:00.854
No! Let go!

42:00.896 --> 42:02.564
Let...!

42:02.606 --> 42:04.107
No!
Please...

42:06.109 --> 42:07.110
Stop.

42:09.613 --> 42:10.572
Heather.

42:10.614 --> 42:12.074
Please...

42:12.115 --> 42:14.618
I'm saying stop.
