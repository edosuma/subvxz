00:04.984 --> 00:07.747
Joseph... this is the last
time we can do this.

00:07.748 --> 00:10.539
What are you talking about?
I'm going back to my husband.

00:10.540 --> 00:12.602
Alfonso? I'm sorry.

00:12.603 --> 00:15.800
Angie, baby, what about us?

00:16.751 --> 00:19.863
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That's him.

00:19.864 --> 00:21.119
He's arrived.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.001
Are you upstairs?

00:23.002 --> 00:24.580
The closet.

00:24.581 --> 00:25.762
Mi bello!

00:33.911 --> 00:35.519
Alright...

00:35.520 --> 00:38.922
What's going on fellas,
the gag getting a little thin.

00:47.468 --> 00:48.863
Oh, my God.

00:48.864 --> 00:50.512
It's Sarah.

00:51.048 --> 00:52.970
They killed Sarah.

00:57.070 --> 01:02.070
<i>Castle [3x18]
One Life to Lose</i>

01:15.566 --> 01:18.583
I know you aren't
cooking breakfast, so...

01:18.584 --> 01:20.131
What is all this?

01:20.132 --> 01:21.319
Spring cleaning.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.456
Oh. Well, mother, I am,
I am shocked.

01:24.457 --> 01:26.037
That you even know
how to operate a sponge.

01:26.038 --> 01:28.347
Oh, I have cleaned before.

01:28.348 --> 01:32.200
Well, I've supervised cleaning before.

01:32.201 --> 01:36.202
And what has prompted, this
sudden burst of domestic devotion?

01:36.203 --> 01:37.903
The space for my acting school

01:37.904 --> 01:39.302
won't be ready for another month,

01:39.303 --> 01:42.243
Alexis is all busy with her A.P. tests,

01:42.244 --> 01:44.858
my lunch date canceled... Oh.

01:44.859 --> 01:46.208
And if I don't do
something productive,

01:46.209 --> 01:49.948
I'm gonna tear my hair out,
so out my way. Pardon.

01:49.949 --> 01:50.633
Oh.

01:52.026 --> 01:53.539
Speaking of hair.

01:53.894 --> 01:55.405
Hello, Beckett.

01:55.406 --> 01:59.869
Yes.
1777 21st Street.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.466
All right. I'll meet you there.

02:01.467 --> 02:04.042
Did you say 1777 21st Street?

02:04.043 --> 02:05.527
Yeah. There was a murder there. Why?

02:05.528 --> 02:07.825
Oh, I know that address.
That's Gemstar Studios.

02:07.826 --> 02:09.466
That's where they film "Temptation Lane."

02:09.467 --> 02:10.816
The soap opera you used to be on?

02:10.817 --> 02:13.063
Oh, I-I hope it's nobody that I know.

02:13.064 --> 02:14.468
Maybe I should go with you.

02:15.490 --> 02:18.296
It's a crime scene, mother.
We're trained professionals.

02:18.297 --> 02:21.076
Richard Castle, you are neither trained

02:21.077 --> 02:22.697
nor a professional.

02:23.983 --> 02:25.759
I'll text you with updates.

02:29.009 --> 02:30.466
Victim's name is Sarah Cutler.

02:30.467 --> 02:31.620
Looks like she was killed last night

02:31.621 --> 02:33.419
and stuffed into a closet on set.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.720
- Was she a part of the production?
- Yeah.

02:35.721 --> 02:37.884
Let me guess.
The diva actress that everyone hated.

02:37.885 --> 02:39.414
Actually, Castle,
she was a writer.

02:39.415 --> 02:41.011
- A writer?
- Mm-hmm.

02:41.012 --> 02:42.542
Why would anyone want to kill a writer?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.275
Oh, so many reasons.

02:44.875 --> 02:48.116
Or maybe Sarah discovered

02:48.117 --> 02:50.810
that Greek billionaire Mikkos
had invented a machine

02:50.811 --> 02:52.241
that could cause blizzards,

02:52.242 --> 02:54.478
that would plunge the
entire world into an ice age.

02:54.479 --> 02:56.146
Really?
You're gonna go with a

02:56.266 --> 02:57.941
evil weather machine?

02:57.942 --> 02:59.587
It already happened.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.868
On "General Hospital."
Look, bear in mind,

03:01.869 --> 03:04.050
we're entering into a world of epic drama

03:04.051 --> 03:05.956
with larger-than-life characters,

03:05.957 --> 03:08.783
each one teeming
with twisted secrets

03:08.784 --> 03:10.080
and personal intrigue.

03:10.081 --> 03:12.714
It stands to reason that
the motive for this murder

03:12.715 --> 03:14.324
will be worthy of a soap opera.

03:14.325 --> 03:16.595
Castle, even in a world of epic drama,

03:16.596 --> 03:18.815
the motives are usually quite ordinary.

03:19.738 --> 03:21.798
Now does that look ordinary to you?

03:23.753 --> 03:25.854
The victim with an ax in her back

03:25.855 --> 03:28.249
on the set of her own show...

03:28.713 --> 03:32.148
Odds are, the killer
walks amongst us,

03:32.149 --> 03:33.907
on this very soundstage.

03:33.908 --> 03:35.380
So what have we got?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.751
Her spinal cord was
severed with the ax.

03:37.752 --> 03:40.120
Upon contact, her lungs
filled with blood,

03:40.121 --> 03:41.516
'causing her to drown.

03:41.517 --> 03:43.972
I can put the time of death
in a 4-hour window,

03:43.973 --> 03:45.471
somewhere between 7:00

03:45.591 --> 03:46.983
and 11:00 P.M. last night.

03:46.984 --> 03:48.483
And where did this ax come from?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.204
It's the fire ax from the stage.

03:50.205 --> 03:51.952
Crew members think
it might be symbolic.

03:52.519 --> 03:53.104
Symbolic?

03:53.105 --> 03:55.195
Well, when Ms. Cutler
took over writing the show,

03:55.196 --> 03:56.402
first thing she did was kill off

03:56.403 --> 03:58.349
one of the main
characters with an ax.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.460
Now it saved the show,
but some of

04:00.461 --> 04:03.702
the fans were unhappy.
You damn right we were unhappy.

04:03.703 --> 04:06.960
Ashley Conrad was the
matriarch of "Temptation Lane"

04:06.961 --> 04:09.241
For 30 years, and then
all of a sudden - Whap!

04:09.242 --> 04:10.301
Lanie.

04:10.302 --> 04:11.306
Right.

04:11.307 --> 04:14.940
Based on the C.S.U. sweep,
she was killed right here.

04:14.941 --> 04:16.736
The killer wiped up the blood spatter

04:16.737 --> 04:18.339
and shoved her in the closet.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.658
Which means they knew
there was a closet,

04:19.659 --> 04:20.543
to shove her into,

04:20.545 --> 04:23.240
Suggesting someone
familiar with the layout.

04:23.241 --> 04:26.268
- An insider, perhaps?
- Well, I just checked with security.

04:26.269 --> 04:28.166
They're on high alert now,
but as you can tell,

04:28.167 --> 04:29.908
things aren't exactly
buttoned up around here.

04:29.909 --> 04:31.047
And what about the cameras?

04:31.048 --> 04:32.352
Only one at the main entrance,

04:32.353 --> 04:34.549
but no one was manning
the entrance to this soundstage.

04:34.550 --> 04:38.668
Oh, so it is possible that
someone from the outside got in?

04:38.669 --> 04:40.294
Have you talked to next of kin?

04:40.295 --> 04:42.970
Husband was on set when
the body was discovered.

04:42.971 --> 04:45.116
Turns out, he's one of the directors.
Okay, so why don't you guys

04:45.117 --> 04:47.107
get statements from
the actors that found her?

04:47.108 --> 04:49.609
- Castle and I will talk to the husband.
- Right.

04:50.517 --> 04:53.220
It's tragic, really.
I mean, Sarah was a gem.

04:53.221 --> 04:55.168
Supremely talented too.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.708
It all begins with the words.

04:56.709 --> 04:59.779
- But it's also how you say them.
- So true.

05:00.261 --> 05:03.108
My performance brings
Angela Cannon to life.

05:03.109 --> 05:04.972
Without Sarah's words,
I'd just be

05:04.973 --> 05:08.044
an incredibly gorgeous
woman named Mandy Bronson.

05:08.674 --> 05:11.467
She really understood Joseph Fox.

05:12.082 --> 05:13.289
My character.

05:13.290 --> 05:14.670
He's very complicated.

05:14.671 --> 05:17.287
Complicated?
A 5 year old could write him.

05:17.288 --> 05:17.983
You know, I'd be insulted

05:17.984 --> 05:19.335
if you actually knew
anything about acting.

05:19.455 --> 05:20.477
Ms. Bronson,

05:21.485 --> 05:23.522
What time did you
leave the studio last night?

05:23.523 --> 05:26.041
We wrapped at 6:00,
and I went straight home.

05:26.605 --> 05:30.856
I, um... I drew a bath,
poured a glass of wine,

05:30.857 --> 05:32.236
put on a little John Legend,

05:32.237 --> 05:33.833
Then I slipped out of my silk robe

05:33.834 --> 05:37.747
and let bubbles soak
every inch of my body.

05:38.042 --> 05:39.428
Dude.

05:39.429 --> 05:41.351
Dude.
Dude.

05:41.352 --> 05:43.540
- I'm just...
- Mr. Hastings, how about you?

05:43.541 --> 05:45.492
Ditto.
You also drew a bubble bath

05:45.493 --> 05:46.552
and listened to some John Legend?

05:46.553 --> 05:48.815
No, I left right after we wrapped.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.164
- And when did you last see Sarah?
- She came down to the set

05:51.165 --> 05:54.270
- right before we shot a love scene.
- Ha! More like a torture scene,

05:54.271 --> 05:56.100
with me getting
smothered by his bulk.

05:56.101 --> 05:57.504
Why don't you get
your ass to the gym?

05:57.505 --> 05:59.058
I'll go to the gym
if you pop a tic tac

05:59.059 --> 06:00.092
the next time we have to kiss.

06:00.093 --> 06:03.048
Can we get back to Sarah
for just one more moment?

06:03.049 --> 06:04.827
Did she have any
enemies in the production?

06:04.828 --> 06:07.735
No, no, Sarah was wonderful.

06:07.736 --> 06:09.411
Everybody loved her.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.934
She treated everyone with respect.

06:11.935 --> 06:14.064
I can't imagine who would do this.

06:16.957 --> 06:19.165
Mr. Powers, when was the last
time you heard from your wife?

06:19.166 --> 06:24.656
I, um, spoke with Sarah...
last night, right...right here,

06:24.657 --> 06:25.897
right where we're standing right now.

06:25.898 --> 06:27.668
And what did the two of you talk about?

06:27.669 --> 06:30.812
- End of the day, just touching base.
- What time was that?

06:30.813 --> 06:33.429
Maybe a little after 6:00.
Uh, didn't you find it strange

06:33.430 --> 06:36.300
that Sarah didn't come home last night?
I'm used to it.

06:36.652 --> 06:39.337
Sarah's the head writer.
Long hours writing scripts

06:39.338 --> 06:41.213
kind of comes with the territory.

06:41.698 --> 06:43.608
She have any trouble with cast or crew?

06:43.609 --> 06:45.460
Well, everybody here has an agenda,

06:45.461 --> 06:47.481
and Sarah had to make
a lot of tough decisions,

06:47.482 --> 06:49.450
But nobody here would actually hurt her.

06:49.869 --> 06:53.077
I mean, we're like a family.
What about anyone outside the show?

06:53.078 --> 06:56.558
No, not that I... 
Wait.

06:56.559 --> 06:58.584
What? FoxCanLover.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.359
"Fox can lover"?

07:00.360 --> 07:04.848
About a week ago,
Sarah had this crazy, obsessed fan

07:04.849 --> 07:06.236
kicked off the set.

07:06.237 --> 07:08.307
Sh-she writes an unofficial
blog about the show.

07:08.308 --> 07:11.284
She's a shipper who goes
by the screen name FoxCanLover.

07:11.285 --> 07:13.620
- A shipper?
- Uh, yeah, it's a person who invests

07:13.621 --> 07:15.507
in the relationships of a show.

07:15.508 --> 07:18.073
In this case, it would be
Joseph Fox and Angela Cannon,

07:18.074 --> 07:19.691
Hence FoxCan.

07:19.692 --> 07:21.622
Exactly, but when she
gets here, she loses it,

07:21.623 --> 07:23.364
goes crazy, threatens Sarah.

07:23.365 --> 07:25.732
- Security has to escort her off.
- Do you know the lady's name?

07:25.733 --> 07:28.079
No, I-I don't, but
Sarah's assistant would.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.606
Reese Harmon.

07:30.403 --> 07:33.697
Is it true? Oh. It's true.

07:33.698 --> 07:36.172
I'm so sorry. My baby's gone.

07:36.173 --> 07:38.642
I'm sorry. This is, um,

07:38.643 --> 07:41.169
this is Sarah's mom, Gloria Chambers.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.799
Detective Beckett is
investigating Sarah's murder.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.530
It's so unfair.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.723
I just got her back, and now she's gone.

07:47.724 --> 07:50.005
Mrs. Chambers, were
the two of you estranged?

07:50.360 --> 07:52.071
We had been for years.

07:52.547 --> 07:55.368
I gave her up for adoption
when I was young.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.507
What kind of monster would do this?

07:58.508 --> 08:00.419
We don't know just yet,
but we are gonna do

08:00.420 --> 08:02.543
everything we can
to bring them to justice.

08:02.544 --> 08:05.399
You'd better, or I will
sue the entire city

08:05.400 --> 08:07.266
for every nickel it's worth.

08:10.809 --> 08:13.193
Well, I understand being upset,

08:13.194 --> 08:14.661
but threatening to sue?

08:14.662 --> 08:17.770
Yeah, well, everybody
processes their grief differently.

08:17.771 --> 08:19.664
Yes, unless she's a
gold-digging opportunist

08:19.665 --> 08:22.101
who's insinuated herself
back into her daughter's life

08:22.102 --> 08:23.683
because she's in need
of a heart transplant,

08:23.684 --> 08:25.557
and Sarah is the
only compatible donor.

08:25.558 --> 08:27.287
Sure, maybe on "Temptation Lane",

08:27.288 --> 08:28.249
not in the real world.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.396
- Uh speaking of which, FoxCan?
- Mm-hmm.

08:30.397 --> 08:32.335
Joseph Fox and Angela Cannon,
how did you know their names?

08:32.469 --> 08:34.491
Uh, one of the uniforms briefed me.

08:34.493 --> 08:37.958
Oh. And shippers relationship fans?

08:37.960 --> 08:40.436
Castle, I do read, you know? 
Cool.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.220
Excuse me.

08:54.221 --> 08:55.970
Are you Reese Harmon?

09:00.027 --> 09:01.676
FoxCanLover's real name

09:01.677 --> 09:04.155
is Carrie Edwards.

09:04.156 --> 09:07.209
She won the set visit
from a literacy charity

09:07.210 --> 09:09.999
that Sarah supported.
She paid $1,000 for it.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.942
Everything was fine at first,
but when she saw Sarah,

09:12.943 --> 09:14.942
she got in her face and started yelling,

09:14.943 --> 09:16.846
"You ruined everything."

09:16.847 --> 09:18.731
Did she ever send Sarah
any threatening letters,

09:18.732 --> 09:20.945
anything that you might have on file?

09:20.946 --> 09:23.781
No, but she did write some
pretty awful things on her blog.

09:23.782 --> 09:25.552
I'll show you that.
Mm-hmm.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.281
If Sarah was working late,
why weren't you here?

09:28.282 --> 09:29.757
You are her assistant?

09:29.758 --> 09:32.319
I usually stay, but Sarah wouldn't let me.

09:32.323 --> 09:32.921
Why not?

09:32.947 --> 09:35.443
One of her passions
was helping young writers.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.383
She got me a position

09:36.384 --> 09:38.078
at the Network Fellowship Program.

09:38.079 --> 09:40.089
We had a mixer last night.

09:41.115 --> 09:45.093
She was supposed to come,
but... she never showed.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.587
When was the last time you saw her?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.236
Around 6:30.

09:49.997 --> 09:52.051
Brought her her coffee and scone.

09:52.052 --> 09:54.602
Here it is.
Last week, the day of the set visit,

09:54.603 --> 09:55.932
look at what she wrote.

09:57.187 --> 09:59.540
"Made it onto the set,

09:59.541 --> 10:02.901
but didn't complete the mission."
Look at the most recent post.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.532
"Last time, I failed.
This time I will succeed.

10:05.533 --> 10:07.565
"She's been stabbing us
loyal fans in the back.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.176
Now it's our turn to take her down..."

10:09.177 --> 10:12.079
"It's time to give her the axe."

10:26.907 --> 10:28.868
She's dead? 
Yeah.

10:28.869 --> 10:30.998
Sarah Cutler's dead?

10:31.487 --> 10:33.603
That's the best news ever.

10:33.604 --> 10:35.166
Can I send a quick tweet?

10:35.448 --> 10:36.820
Not cool?

10:37.469 --> 10:38.485
I'll wait. Must have been

10:38.486 --> 10:40.426
difficult not to blog about it last night.

10:40.427 --> 10:42.115
Yeah. How would I know?

10:44.025 --> 10:45.713
Wait.

10:45.714 --> 10:48.009
You guys think I had
something to do with this?

10:48.010 --> 10:50.432
Well, I mean, your blog clearly spells out

10:50.433 --> 10:53.603
your determination to take out Sarah.

10:54.015 --> 10:56.313
But everybody talks tough on the Internet.

10:56.314 --> 10:59.725
You wrote, "It's time to give her the ax"

10:59.726 --> 11:01.637
The day she was killed with an ax.

11:01.638 --> 11:03.481
Okay, now I can explain this.

11:03.482 --> 11:05.272
We already figured it out.

11:05.273 --> 11:08.045
You bought the set visit
to get closer to Sarah.

11:08.046 --> 11:09.716
Your visit was cut short.

11:09.717 --> 11:12.349
You came back last night
when no one was around

11:12.350 --> 11:15.789
and then you remembered,
there's an ax on the soundstage.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.951
No, no, no. I bought the set visit

11:17.952 --> 11:20.394
because she was being
swayed by the CanFonsos.

11:20.395 --> 11:21.124
Who?

11:21.125 --> 11:24.943
The CanFonsos, the opposition.

11:25.375 --> 11:28.076
They believe that Angela Cannon

11:28.077 --> 11:30.279
should be together
with Alfonso Dominguez.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.266
I was trying to convince her

11:31.267 --> 11:34.193
- that Angela belongs with Joseph.
- With an ax?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.609
Yes.

11:35.610 --> 11:37.445
Wait. No.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.700
I was organizing a protest, okay?
We were gonna send

11:39.701 --> 11:42.257
a whole bunch of axes
to the head of the network,

11:42.258 --> 11:44.582
demanding that Sarah be fired.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.693
I've got everybody on my web site doing it.

11:46.694 --> 11:49.183
We want them to know that
we think Sarah's ruining the show.

11:49.184 --> 11:51.257
Where were you last night
between 7:00 and 11:00?

11:51.258 --> 11:53.409
I was chatting with the other FoxCans.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.613
Wild guess, alone?

11:55.614 --> 11:59.376
No. No, and I can prove it.
Mary and Dennis were home.

11:59.377 --> 12:01.028
And those are your roommates?

12:01.029 --> 12:02.890
No. My parents.

12:09.724 --> 12:11.980
I just don't see that girl swinging an ax,

12:11.981 --> 12:14.095
let alone leaving her house.

12:14.096 --> 12:16.791
What's the matter, homicidal fan
not soapy enough for you?

12:16.792 --> 12:18.379
You know, when you say soapy,

12:18.380 --> 12:20.396
- I conjure up images.
- Castle, focus.

12:20.397 --> 12:22.365
I am. On our suspect.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.017
Oh. I mean, you saw how obsessive she was.

12:25.018 --> 12:27.595
She invests in these
fictional relationships.

12:27.596 --> 12:31.115
She cares if Angela is gonna
get back together with Alfonso,

12:31.235 --> 12:33.201
if Marguerite's gonna
survive her cancer scare.

12:33.222 --> 12:34.178
Oh, my God.

12:34.179 --> 12:35.049
What?

12:35.050 --> 12:37.004
You watch "Temptation Lane."

12:37.005 --> 12:38.523
What?

12:38.524 --> 12:39.774
No.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.358
No one said anything...

12:43.677 --> 12:45.813
About Marguerite's cancer scare.

12:45.814 --> 12:49.241
You know a lot about shippers,
you know about FoxCans

12:49.242 --> 12:53.399
you are a fan, a big, fat
"Temptation Lane" fan.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.734
Okay, maybe I watched it
like once or twice.

12:56.545 --> 12:59.357
It's just so delightfully not you.

12:59.358 --> 13:01.408
So says the guy who rattles off plot points

13:01.409 --> 13:02.733
from "General Hospital."

13:02.734 --> 13:04.709
Oh, that is completely different.

13:04.710 --> 13:07.929
- That is for research.
- What was for research?

13:07.930 --> 13:09.829
Nothing.

13:12.909 --> 13:14.427
Mary and Dennis confirm

13:14.428 --> 13:16.066
that blogger chick
was in her room all night.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.219
What about the cast and crew?

13:17.220 --> 13:18.917
So far, all their alibis checked out.

13:18.918 --> 13:21.598
But I was looking over Sarah's schedule.

13:21.599 --> 13:22.862
Last week, there were
a couple of appointments

13:22.863 --> 13:24.734
that just say "M."
And there was another one,

13:24.735 --> 13:27.834
the day before the murder,
then one scheduled for tomorrow.

13:27.835 --> 13:30.555
So her assistant didn't schedule these,

13:30.556 --> 13:31.911
which means it was personal,

13:31.912 --> 13:32.392
and her husband didn't

13:32.393 --> 13:34.486
know about them either.
With Sarah's workload,

13:34.487 --> 13:36.049
It must have been important
for her to make time.

13:36.050 --> 13:38.173
Exactly, and her husband
and assistant both say that

13:38.174 --> 13:40.531
when she came back from
these appointments, she was upset.

13:40.532 --> 13:42.188
All right, let's see what
we can dig up from that.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.287
- Hey, Beckett.
- Hey, what'd you find at the apartment?

13:45.288 --> 13:46.707
Her husband's stuff.

13:46.708 --> 13:49.563
His clothes are gone,
and only her stuff is in the bathroom,

13:49.564 --> 13:51.321
so I talked to the doorman, and he said

13:51.322 --> 13:53.728
that Vince hasn't lived
there in almost two months.

13:53.729 --> 13:55.868
They've been separated.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.782
Funny he didn't mention that earlier.

13:57.783 --> 14:00.593
Looks like someone's hiding
something on "Temptation Lane."

14:00.594 --> 14:03.161
Look, I knew if I told you
that my marriage was in trouble,

14:03.162 --> 14:05.193
that I would be suspect number one.

14:05.194 --> 14:08.180
Maybe, but now that we know that you lied,

14:08.181 --> 14:10.228
it makes you look even worse.

14:10.738 --> 14:12.191
Why did you separate?

14:12.192 --> 14:14.999
Everything changed after
Sarah got the big promotion.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.229
If I wanted to spend time with my own wife,

14:17.230 --> 14:19.332
I had to schedule an appointment.

14:19.922 --> 14:22.287
It wasn't working, so I moved out.

14:22.288 --> 14:23.943
You know, there's another
version of this story,

14:23.944 --> 14:27.312
where your wife kicked you out,
and then she demanded a divorce.

14:27.313 --> 14:28.945
Hmm. Only this way, you don't have to worry

14:28.946 --> 14:31.961
about splitting your assets.
I didn't kill my wife.

14:31.962 --> 14:34.411
Well, then where were you
the night that she was killed?

14:34.412 --> 14:35.453
I was at the hotel.

14:35.454 --> 14:37.562
I went there immediately
after we wrapped here.

14:37.563 --> 14:39.500
And can anyone vouch for that?

14:40.562 --> 14:42.311
C'mon, Vince.

14:42.312 --> 14:43.659
Tell us you where alone.

14:43.660 --> 14:46.543
And it will make arresting
you, that much easier.

14:48.665 --> 14:50.126
I, um...

14:52.310 --> 14:54.776
I wasn't... alone.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.704
I'm gonna need a name.

14:59.226 --> 15:00.579
Mandy Bronson.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.187
Mandy Bronson?

15:02.188 --> 15:05.389
As in Angela Cannon,
as in star of "Temptation Lane"?

15:05.390 --> 15:07.998
Yes, that Mandy Bronson.

15:07.999 --> 15:09.106
Just checking.

15:12.596 --> 15:14.326
Did she stay the night?

15:14.327 --> 15:17.133
No. We ordered room service, and, um...

15:17.582 --> 15:19.693
At 07:00, she got an e-mail from Sarah

15:19.694 --> 15:20.825
and she went running off.

15:20.826 --> 15:23.741
So the night that your wife was killed,

15:23.742 --> 15:26.115
she e-mailed your mistress,

15:26.116 --> 15:28.244
And you didn't think that that
was important to mention?

15:28.245 --> 15:29.671
It wasn't a big deal.

15:31.041 --> 15:33.731
I asked Mandy about it.
She got some new script pages

15:33.732 --> 15:35.387
that Sarah wanted her to look over,

15:35.388 --> 15:37.285
So she went home to memorize them.

15:37.286 --> 15:38.605
Were you alone the rest of the night?

15:38.606 --> 15:41.324
Yes. Yes. I cracked the minibar,

15:41.325 --> 15:43.346
I ordered pay-per-view. You can check.

15:43.347 --> 15:44.755
I will.

15:45.029 --> 15:47.231
It can't be the husband.
Well, he's got motive.

15:47.232 --> 15:49.699
Yeah, but marriage on the rocks,
killing for money?

15:49.700 --> 15:51.448
That's just so ordinary?

15:51.449 --> 15:53.777
We need to focus on Mandy Bronson

15:53.778 --> 15:56.245
home-wrecking diva engaged
in a torrid affair

15:56.246 --> 15:57.767
with the victim's husband.

15:57.768 --> 15:59.471
She fled their illicit love nest

15:59.472 --> 16:01.937
after a mysterious e-mail from Sarah

16:01.938 --> 16:03.599
on the eve of her murder.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.662
Yeah, but we don't even
know if there was an e-mail.

16:05.663 --> 16:08.774
I mean, Vincent could've been lying.
But you are right.

16:08.775 --> 16:10.827
Mandy Bronson does
have some explaining to do.

16:10.828 --> 16:12.343
"Esplanie." 
What?

16:12.344 --> 16:14.239
Lanie And Esposito.
Like FoxCan.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.808
We can call them Esplanie,
which is perfect,

16:16.850 --> 16:19.145
because they're always esplaining things.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.216
Mother?

16:20.217 --> 16:22.519
Hi. Martha, what a surprise.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.925
Yes, what an unexpected surprise.

16:24.926 --> 16:27.395
What are you doing here?
Grieving.

16:27.396 --> 16:28.851
You didn't even know the victim.

16:28.852 --> 16:30.616
Darling, a loss for a show like this

16:30.617 --> 16:33.372
is a loss for anyone who was
ever part of its history.

16:34.221 --> 16:35.733
And...

16:35.734 --> 16:37.546
I think I can be of help here.

16:37.985 --> 16:40.789
I think I could be your inside source

16:40.790 --> 16:43.526
and get the scoop on
what's really going on here.

16:43.527 --> 16:47.842
And what better place
to start than Lance Hastings?

16:47.843 --> 16:48.636
You know him?

16:48.637 --> 16:52.021
He was my love interest
30 years ago, onscreen...

16:52.022 --> 16:53.536
And off.

16:54.404 --> 16:57.255
After my character married
his character, Joseph Fox,

16:57.256 --> 17:02.509
she was kidnapped, buried alive,
trapped in a cave with bears,

17:02.510 --> 17:05.343
and held hostage in
the sewers of Paris.

17:05.344 --> 17:08.175
How long were you on the show?
Three weeks.

17:08.176 --> 17:10.837
Gotta go. Excuse me.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.773
My mother gives new meaning
to the word "Transparent."

17:22.550 --> 17:25.565
There's her account.
What are you looking for?

17:25.566 --> 17:28.444
An e-mail that Sarah sent before she died.

17:29.464 --> 17:30.708
There it is.

17:31.522 --> 17:34.297
"Meet me at the office ASAP."

17:34.298 --> 17:36.676
So Sarah had Mandy meet
her here that night.

17:36.677 --> 17:38.074
You think she found out about the affair,

17:38.075 --> 17:41.614
planned to confront her?
I don't know. There's an attachment.

17:42.986 --> 17:45.018
Oh, it's a script for an upcoming episode.

17:45.528 --> 17:47.946
The characters are vacationing in Pamplona.

17:49.116 --> 17:51.299
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.311
Mandy Bronson's character
is gored to death

17:53.312 --> 17:56.347
while running with the bulls.
Sarah brought her here

17:56.348 --> 17:58.643
to tell Mandy she was
writing her off the show.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.629
Looks like Mandy wrote her off first.

18:07.418 --> 18:09.436
Castle. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.174
I know she's a murder suspect,

18:12.920 --> 18:15.527
but you gotta admit, she is smokin' hot.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.316
Agreed. So hot, in fact,
it led to a torrid affair

18:19.317 --> 18:21.155
with Sarah's director husband.

18:21.156 --> 18:22.107
Sarah found out about it,

18:22.108 --> 18:24.021
decided to kill off Mandy's character.

18:24.022 --> 18:25.661
Doesn't get any soapier than that.

18:25.662 --> 18:27.185
Well obviously you
haven't seen Chiquitas.

18:27.186 --> 18:30.401
- As in "bananas"?
- No, as in the telenovela.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.637
Oh. I used to watch it
growing up with my grandmother.

18:32.638 --> 18:35.579
Bro, there was this one episode
where Gabriela discovered that

18:35.580 --> 18:38.229
her husband was sleeping
with her evil twin sister Teresita,

18:38.230 --> 18:39.291
only to later find out that she had

18:39.292 --> 18:41.141
multiple personality disorder.

18:41.142 --> 18:43.121
Wait. Does that even qualify as cheating?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.450
Dude. What?

18:44.451 --> 18:45.952
Don't overthink it.

18:49.178 --> 18:52.754
Ms. Bronson, I'm curious how you felt,

18:52.755 --> 18:54.005
when you found out,

18:54.006 --> 18:55.955
that Sarah was gonna
kill off your character?

18:55.956 --> 18:59.809
Kill off my character?
That's ridiculous.

18:59.810 --> 19:01.704
I'm the reason the ratings were up.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.362
Well, then why did she write this scene

19:03.363 --> 19:06.207
where Angela Cannon has
an unfortunate encounter

19:06.208 --> 19:07.426
with a bull?

19:07.427 --> 19:09.718
Sarah probably writes a death scene

19:09.719 --> 19:11.458
for every character on the show...

19:11.459 --> 19:13.570
To keep the actors in line.

19:13.571 --> 19:17.198
She wrote those particular pages
the night that she was murdered

19:17.199 --> 19:19.002
while you were with her husband.

19:19.003 --> 19:20.106
He told us that you left

19:20.107 --> 19:22.460
right after you got an e-mail from Sarah.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.781
But you didn't go home, did you?

19:24.782 --> 19:27.144
You went to go and confront her.

19:27.145 --> 19:29.556
Sarah wanted to save her marriage.

19:29.557 --> 19:30.945
She thought the way she could do that,

19:30.946 --> 19:32.410
was to get me out of the picture.

19:32.411 --> 19:34.724
And you wanted to urge her to reconsider,

19:34.725 --> 19:35.989
and when she didn't, you killed her.

19:35.990 --> 19:38.089
I admit, I went to see the bitch.

19:38.090 --> 19:41.192
I told her Angela Cannon is
the heart and soul of the show.

19:41.193 --> 19:43.796
But when I saw she
wouldn't back down, I left.

19:43.797 --> 19:46.192
I didn't need to kill her.
And why is that?

19:46.193 --> 19:48.404
Because I still had a hand to play.

19:48.405 --> 19:50.164
Everybody thinks Sarah calls the shots

19:50.165 --> 19:51.732
at "Temptation Lane."

19:51.733 --> 19:54.024
But the second in command, Peter Connelly,

19:54.025 --> 19:56.040
he's the one the network really trusts.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.939
What is this other hand
that you had to play?

19:58.126 --> 20:00.286
I did what any industrious
actress would do.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.414
I went to his apartment
straight from the studio

20:03.622 --> 20:05.641
and used my powers of persuasion

20:05.642 --> 20:07.066
to get him on my side.

20:09.793 --> 20:10.994
When did you leave?

20:11.562 --> 20:12.762
The sun was up.

20:13.002 --> 20:14.650
And my character is still alive.

20:16.514 --> 20:18.817
Yeah, she showed up at
my apartment last night.

20:19.022 --> 20:21.950
She was wearing a fur coat. 
So?

20:23.114 --> 20:24.168
Just...

20:24.169 --> 20:25.419
A fur coat.

20:26.346 --> 20:29.501
And I nearly had a heart attack
when she let it slip open.

20:29.577 --> 20:31.927
Years of fantasizing, and there she was,

20:31.928 --> 20:35.034
standing right in front of me.
And what did she want?

20:35.035 --> 20:36.112
She was all fired up

20:36.113 --> 20:38.694
about Sarah wanting to
write her off the show.

20:38.858 --> 20:41.818
So then I had to listen to Mandy summarize

20:41.819 --> 20:45.533
every "Soap Digest" article
praising her performance.

20:45.534 --> 20:47.133
Just to make her stop...

20:48.474 --> 20:50.221
I agreed that I would talk to Sarah.

20:50.222 --> 20:51.709
Only now you don't have to.

20:53.197 --> 20:56.217
Reese. Grab your laptop and join the group.

20:56.218 --> 20:58.141
We're all hands on deck. You mean it?

20:58.142 --> 20:59.710
I'm not gonna ask you twice.

21:01.462 --> 21:02.644
Sounds like you're pretty desperate.

21:02.645 --> 21:05.397
Mr. Castle, you publish,
what, one book a year?

21:05.745 --> 21:06.595
Give or take.

21:06.596 --> 21:10.639
In that same time period,
we produce 250 episodes.

21:10.640 --> 21:14.132
I'm down a writer.
Reese wrote some script about horses

21:14.133 --> 21:15.901
that Sarah actually liked, so, yeah,

21:15.902 --> 21:17.918
I'm gonna take the extra
help where I can get it.

21:17.919 --> 21:19.521
Unless, of course, you'd like to jump in.

21:19.522 --> 21:22.056
You know what's interesting?
With Sarah out of the way,

21:22.057 --> 21:23.329
Mandy gets to stay on the show,

21:23.330 --> 21:26.393
and you get promoted.
Hey, I'm a professional.

21:26.394 --> 21:28.607
Mandy's staying because Angela Cannon

21:28.608 --> 21:30.478
is the heart and soul of this show.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.808
Well, where have I heard that before?

21:31.809 --> 21:33.393
Uh, we'll keep in touch.

21:36.082 --> 21:36.563
Beckett.

21:36.564 --> 21:38.444
So the hotel confirmed
that the time sensors

21:38.445 --> 21:41.273
in Vince's minibar
were activated till 11:30 P.M.

21:41.274 --> 21:42.684
So I guess our deadly love triangle

21:42.685 --> 21:45.396
wasn't so deadly after all.
Not on his side anyway.

21:45.397 --> 21:46.976
But the hot news is,
Ryan got a hit,

21:46.977 --> 21:49.264
On those mystery appointments
that Sarah was going to.

21:49.723 --> 21:51.082
He found credit card charges

21:51.083 --> 21:52.374
that matched up time and

21:52.375 --> 21:54.951
date to the meetings.
And where was she going?

21:55.026 --> 21:58.597
To a coffee shop on 7th,
and according to her calendar,

21:58.598 --> 22:00.241
her next meeting is in about an hour.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.998
Castle, you up for a coffee break?

22:04.071 --> 22:05.894
There you go.
Thanks.

22:06.721 --> 22:07.970
Can I help you?

22:08.033 --> 22:09.681
Yes. I hope so.

22:10.766 --> 22:12.334
Do you recognize this woman?

22:12.461 --> 22:13.710
Yeah.

22:15.171 --> 22:16.259
Why?

22:18.141 --> 22:21.535
She can't be dead. She,
can't be dead. She can't.

22:21.902 --> 22:23.520
I'm so sorry, Ms. Goldberg.

22:23.521 --> 22:27.063
It's not fair. It is so not fair.

22:27.826 --> 22:29.634
What am I supposed to do?

22:30.341 --> 22:32.017
Did the two of you
know each other very well?

22:32.018 --> 22:33.785
Actually, I didn't know her at all.

22:35.058 --> 22:37.090
Then why would you be so upset?

22:37.091 --> 22:38.626
Well, because...

22:38.830 --> 22:40.941
She promised she would read my screenplay,

22:40.942 --> 22:42.414
And if she liked it...

22:43.802 --> 22:45.337
She would help me find an agent.

22:45.338 --> 22:47.466
Who would she meet when she came here?

22:48.630 --> 22:51.638
What's it matter? She's dead.

22:52.029 --> 22:53.994
I lost my chance.

23:00.882 --> 23:02.097
I'll tell you what

23:03.622 --> 23:04.936
I'll make you a deal.

23:05.562 --> 23:07.514
If you tell us what happened after that,

23:07.852 --> 23:08.736
I'll read your script,

23:08.737 --> 23:10.845
and if I like it, I'll give it to my agent.

23:10.846 --> 23:11.982
Really?

23:12.105 --> 23:13.322
Really.

23:14.253 --> 23:17.052
She met with a guy, and they
sat at a table in a corner.

23:17.193 --> 23:18.328
Do you remember what he looked like?

23:18.329 --> 23:22.842
Um... like him.
Exactly like him.

23:22.843 --> 23:25.008
Uh, give me a double espresso, will ya?

23:25.031 --> 23:25.957
What about my script?
I'll come back and get it when we're done.

23:25.990 --> 23:27.926
I'll come back and
we'll get it when we're done.

23:27.968 --> 23:29.201
Oh.

23:35.493 --> 23:36.610
Do I know you?

23:36.611 --> 23:37.916
I'm a friend of Sarah Cutler.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.330
Yeah? You bring my money?

23:40.831 --> 23:42.052
What money?

23:42.053 --> 23:44.710
Look, I did what she asked,

23:45.042 --> 23:46.865
and now I want what I'm owed.

23:46.942 --> 23:49.454
And, um, what is it
that she asked you to do?

23:50.718 --> 23:53.423
None of your damn business.
Who the hell are you?

23:54.159 --> 23:55.567
NYPD.

23:55.701 --> 23:58.053
Sarah's dead, so it is my business.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.170
Now... who the hell are you?

24:00.217 --> 24:02.232
Johnny Dimes. I'm a P.I.

24:02.233 --> 24:06.105
Sarah Cutler was a client.
What do you mean, she's dead?

24:06.106 --> 24:08.914
"She's dead" only really
has the one meaning.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.898
Did she hire you to follow her husband?

24:11.042 --> 24:12.426
Husband? 
No.

24:12.734 --> 24:15.150
She hired me to investigate
Gloria Chambers.

24:15.631 --> 24:16.601
The mom.

24:16.602 --> 24:19.265
I knew it. Was she involved
in organ harvesting?

24:19.266 --> 24:22.354
That really didn't come up,
but I can tell you this.

24:22.886 --> 24:25.269
Gloria Chambers isn't
her real birth mom.

24:25.614 --> 24:26.812
She's a fake.

24:26.813 --> 24:30.319
Ohh. The mom isn't really the mom?

24:31.019 --> 24:32.921
Does it get any soapier than that?

24:42.390 --> 24:43.352
Ooh.

24:43.503 --> 24:46.737
Oh, Is that the P.I's file
on Sarah's faux mother?

24:46.738 --> 24:48.884
Yeah, apparently Gloria
showed up three years ago

24:48.885 --> 24:52.005
claiming to be Sarah's birth mom,
and Sarah got suspicious.

24:52.006 --> 24:54.789
So she hired a P.I. in order
to look into Gloria's history.

24:54.790 --> 24:57.841
What nefarious scheme
has Gloria set into motion?

24:57.842 --> 24:59.183
Perhaps she planned...

24:59.403 --> 25:01.577
On replacing Sarah with a clone.

25:02.054 --> 25:03.318
She wanted Sarah's money.

25:03.606 --> 25:04.278
Money?

25:04.279 --> 25:05.908
Yeah.
Sorry to burst your bubble, Castle,

25:05.909 --> 25:09.164
but Gloria's got a history
of insurance scams

25:09.165 --> 25:11.469
and husbands with empty bank accounts.

25:11.470 --> 25:12.649
- We bringing her in?
- Yeah, we're trying.

25:12.769 --> 25:13.825
We put out an A.P.B.

25:13.826 --> 25:14.573
Her apartment's empty,

25:14.574 --> 25:17.454
and the doorman saw her
leave with a suitcase this morning.

25:17.490 --> 25:18.754
Ooh.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.916
So maybe Dimes tells
Sarah about Gloria,

25:23.917 --> 25:25.061
Sarah confronts her,

25:25.062 --> 25:28.197
And then Gloria kills Sarah
in order to avoid exposure.

25:28.198 --> 25:30.905
And after playing the role
of grieving mother on set,

25:30.906 --> 25:33.450
Gloria knew enough to get
the hell out of dodge.

25:36.770 --> 25:38.696
Yo. Look who got caught

25:38.697 --> 25:41.134
trying to buy a ticket
to the Bahamas at J.F.K.

25:41.135 --> 25:41.667
Gloria.

25:41.787 --> 25:44.318
Everything in New York
reminded me of Sarah.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.302
I needed to distance myself

25:46.303 --> 25:48.414
from the agonizing
truth that she's dead.

25:50.728 --> 25:52.906
Now if denial is a crime...

25:54.770 --> 25:56.017
I plead guilty.

25:56.202 --> 25:57.308
Good to know.

25:58.038 --> 25:59.606
Now how do you plead on murder?

26:00.015 --> 26:03.205
Gloria Chambers,
also known as Charlene Sellars.

26:03.206 --> 26:04.837
You have been a very busy woman.

26:05.606 --> 26:08.438
Yours is a real rags-to-riches story.

26:08.494 --> 26:12.078
Only trouble is, the riches
never seem to be yours.

26:12.358 --> 26:13.641
Fraud in Florida,

26:13.642 --> 26:15.821
Embezzlement in North Carolina

26:15.822 --> 26:18.173
I served my time for
those prior misunderstandings.

26:18.174 --> 26:20.332
And then you latched on
to your next meal ticket,

26:20.333 --> 26:22.221
Constantine Pirelli.

26:22.618 --> 26:25.689
After him, it was Ernesto Cruz.

26:25.842 --> 26:28.002
I hear they're very anxious
for you to come back...

26:28.269 --> 26:29.329
With their money.

26:29.330 --> 26:32.274
I was married to those men.
It was our money.

26:32.710 --> 26:33.814
I can tell you,

26:34.006 --> 26:35.398
I earned every penny.

26:35.498 --> 26:37.633
But as usual, you blew it
all, and so you looked for

26:37.634 --> 26:39.813
your next ticket, which you
found in Sarah Cutler.

26:39.814 --> 26:41.533
You heard an interview
where she mentioned

26:41.534 --> 26:44.129
being adopted, did a little research,

26:44.130 --> 26:46.738
and then showed up
as the long-lost mother.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.628
Sarah might have
been under the impression

26:48.629 --> 26:51.830
that she was my daughter,
but I didn't kill her.

26:51.930 --> 26:53.977
I mean, in my own way, I was

26:54.518 --> 26:55.728
I was fond of Sarah.

26:55.729 --> 26:58.457
Fond enough that you were able
to masquerade as her mother.

26:58.458 --> 26:59.938
You had motive to kill her.

26:59.939 --> 27:02.030
That's why you tried to flee the country.

27:02.150 --> 27:03.236
What motive?

27:03.237 --> 27:07.878
Her will shows that she planned
to leave you $300,000.

27:08.506 --> 27:10.625
Mm.
She's a generous girl, my Sarah.

27:10.626 --> 27:13.953
She's not your Sarah.
And that's not your money.

27:14.242 --> 27:16.290
You knew she wrote you into her will.

27:16.322 --> 27:18.929
In fact, you probably
planned it all along.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.022
When she confronted you,

27:20.023 --> 27:21.889
you knew that you
had a narrow window

27:21.890 --> 27:23.101
within which to kill her

27:23.102 --> 27:25.549
before she wrote you out.
Here's your problem

27:25.637 --> 27:27.175
I am not your killer.

27:27.313 --> 27:31.656
If I were you, I'd look into
the other man in her life.

27:31.657 --> 27:33.697
What other man?
The one that gave her

27:33.698 --> 27:37.842
the 2-karat Arthur Klein
earrings just the other day.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.989
Does this other man have a name?

27:39.990 --> 27:41.258
Sarah didn't tell me that,

27:41.259 --> 27:43.461
But whoever he was,
they must have just split up,

27:43.462 --> 27:44.873
because he was trying to win her over.

27:44.874 --> 27:46.060
Really, you're gonna point us

27:46.061 --> 27:47.738
to a mysterious stranger?

27:47.802 --> 27:50.611
- It's the truth.
- Coming from a professional liar.

27:50.612 --> 27:54.473
I was nowhere near
this godforsaken soap set.

27:54.652 --> 27:56.188
When she died, I...

27:56.915 --> 27:59.233
I was doing something
useful with my time.

27:59.246 --> 28:00.733
Waiting to the blind.

28:01.006 --> 28:03.278
Hm, close.
I was donating.

28:04.055 --> 28:05.413
To the ponies.

28:08.982 --> 28:11.665
*** two receipts in Gloria's purse
put a betting on races.

28:12.406 --> 28:15.556
An our time of death is
estimated at 11:00 on the outside,

28:15.557 --> 28:16.572
and we don't have anything to tie

28:16.573 --> 28:18.821
her to the studio.
I thought fake mom was a lock.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.270
It's starting to look
less that way by the minute.

28:21.286 --> 28:24.008
I found the earrings
that Gloria talked about

28:24.009 --> 28:26.553
- in Sarah's apartment.
- Fancy.

28:26.554 --> 28:28.530
Yeah, over 10 grand worth of fancy.

28:28.531 --> 28:29.924
Those are worth over 10 grand?

28:29.925 --> 28:32.609
Please. Lanie loves diamonds.

28:32.610 --> 28:34.962
"Diamonds are forever,
like my devotion to you."

28:34.963 --> 28:37.246
Who writes notes this cheesy?
Well, not the husband.

28:37.247 --> 28:39.902
I checked on his financials.
He didn't buy them.

28:40.254 --> 28:42.060
Okay, so maybe Gloria
was telling us the truth.

28:42.061 --> 28:45.214
Maybe Sarah was having an affair.
Well, that makes perfect sense.

28:45.215 --> 28:47.253
Sarah was separated from her husband Vince,

28:47.254 --> 28:48.901
and after long, grueling days at work,

28:48.902 --> 28:50.877
she'd go home to a cold, empty apartment.

28:50.878 --> 28:53.469
Feeling lonely, betrayed, she seeks comfort

28:53.470 --> 28:55.022
in the arms of this mystery man...

28:55.090 --> 28:57.152
and she decides that she
wants her husband back,

28:57.153 --> 28:59.161
so she writes his
mistress, Mandy Bronson,

28:59.162 --> 29:00.909
off the show, in order
to save their marriage.

29:00.910 --> 29:02.541
And her next stop would be
to get rid of the other man.

29:02.542 --> 29:05.008
So maybe the other man didn't
go off quietly into the night.

29:05.009 --> 29:07.345
Do you two practice this
when we're not around?

29:08.854 --> 29:10.418
These earrings are exclusive

29:10.419 --> 29:12.461
to Arthur Klein's Boutique in Chelsea.

29:12.462 --> 29:14.379
Let's find out who bought them.

29:16.966 --> 29:18.606
Okay, so Gloria is in the clear.

29:18.607 --> 29:21.197
Uniforms showed her photo at O.T.B.,

29:21.587 --> 29:24.625
And a bartender there
remembers seeing her at 11:15.

29:25.725 --> 29:28.317
You know, I can see why
she fell for Gloria's con.

29:29.138 --> 29:30.896
Sarah was motherless, childless,

29:30.897 --> 29:33.122
she was taking young
writers under her wing.

29:33.190 --> 29:34.895
- She was looking for family.
- Wow, Castle.

29:34.896 --> 29:37.357
That's a refreshingly
down-to-earth theory.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.721
Just trying to keep
you on your toes.

29:38.722 --> 29:41.844
Hey, so we ran down
purchases at Klein's Boutique,

29:41.845 --> 29:43.242
and guess who popped.

29:44.833 --> 29:47.133
- Lance Hastings?
- And that's not all.

29:47.134 --> 29:50.094
I ran Lance's credit card
activity to confirm the purchase

29:50.166 --> 29:51.557
and something else caught my eye.

29:51.558 --> 29:53.189
Lance charged a cab ride to the studio

29:53.190 --> 29:55.104
the night of the murder.
Yeah, when we interviewed him,

29:55.105 --> 29:56.913
he said he went straight
home at 6:00 P.M.

29:56.914 --> 29:59.133
Cab company drove him
back to the studio around 8:00.

29:59.134 --> 30:00.612
Okay, so that falls
right within the window

30:00.613 --> 30:02.667
of our time of death.
Go pick him up.

30:02.668 --> 30:03.849
Yeah, we already sent a uniform.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.521
He's not home, and he's
not answering his phone.

30:05.522 --> 30:08.034
My mother was speaking
to him earlier on set.

30:09.438 --> 30:11.549
Hi, sweetie. Is Gram there?
I need to talk to her.

30:14.757 --> 30:15.830
What's wrong?

30:17.051 --> 30:18.457
I know where the killer is.

30:20.066 --> 30:21.266
He's with my mother.

30:31.763 --> 30:34.101
Castle, it's okay. I'm sure
your mom's not in any danger.

30:34.102 --> 30:35.796
Yeah, you're probably right.
I'm sorry, my dear,

30:35.797 --> 30:37.336
but after everything I've told you,

30:37.337 --> 30:38.912
I can't let you leave this room alive.

30:38.913 --> 30:40.246
Lance, think about what you're doing.

30:40.247 --> 30:41.684
I am thinking about it.

30:41.685 --> 30:44.393
I can't let you live!
Think about Sarah!

30:44.394 --> 30:45.284
Drop the knife!
What?

30:45.285 --> 30:48.257
Drop the weapon.
W-w-w-wait a minute.

30:48.258 --> 30:49.025
Aah!

30:49.026 --> 30:51.317
Richard, what are you doing?

30:51.318 --> 30:53.430
Oh, nothing. Just saving
your life. That's all.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.121
She said drop the knife!

30:55.122 --> 30:57.414
The only thing that knife
could kill is butter.

30:58.825 --> 31:00.057
What are you talking about?

31:05.158 --> 31:06.374
It's a prop.

31:06.558 --> 31:08.161
We were just working out a scene.

31:08.162 --> 31:10.017
Guys, it was completely my idea.

31:10.018 --> 31:13.587
You know, the actor's version
of "Show Me Your Golf Swing."

31:13.999 --> 31:15.592
Well, the knife may be fake,

31:15.593 --> 31:17.866
but the ax you put into
Sarah's back was real.

31:19.710 --> 31:22.341
You lied to detectives
Ryan and Esposito,

31:22.342 --> 31:24.934
regarding your whereabouts
the night of the murder.

31:25.431 --> 31:26.203
You want the truth?

31:26.232 --> 31:28.310
That would be a great place to start.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.898
You can't handle the truth.

31:31.818 --> 31:35.705
Sir, I am not interested in your
Jack Nicholson impressions.

31:35.706 --> 31:37.723
We know that you
went back to the studio.

31:37.818 --> 31:39.114
The night of the murder.

31:39.275 --> 31:42.155
And what I'm asking is why.

31:42.245 --> 31:44.572
It was a friendly conversation
between colleagues.

31:44.573 --> 31:48.205
A friendly conversation
in which she told you

31:48.206 --> 31:50.033
she was going to go
back to her husband.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.037
What the hell are
you talking about?

31:51.038 --> 31:51.783
Why would she do that?

31:51.689 --> 31:53.308
Because she was
breaking up with you.

31:53.309 --> 31:55.003
Is that what you think
is going on here?

31:55.004 --> 31:57.893
You think that Sarah
and I were lovers?

31:57.894 --> 31:59.572
Did you or did you not

31:59.573 --> 32:02.445
buy an expensive pair of
diamond earrings for her?

32:02.446 --> 32:04.537
Yes, but not to woo her.
It was to encourage Sarah,

32:04.538 --> 32:06.559
to let me out of my
contract for a movie role.

32:06.679 --> 32:07.674
A movie role?

32:07.675 --> 32:09.853
Yes, the Coen brothers
have asked me to play

32:09.854 --> 32:11.729
Matt Damon's half-wit
dad in their new movie.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.672
It's a role of a lifetime.
It has nominations

32:13.673 --> 32:15.845
written all over it.
But that still doesn't explain

32:15.846 --> 32:17.841
why you went back
to the studio that night.

32:17.842 --> 32:19.205
I went to thank Sarah in person,

32:19.206 --> 32:23.302
because my agent had called me that evening to
tell her that she had agreed to let me out.

32:23.337 --> 32:26.468
Reason I didn't mention any
of this is I didn't want to risk

32:26.469 --> 32:27.633
missing work on the movie.

32:27.634 --> 32:28.962
Why didn't you just call her?

32:28.966 --> 32:31.209
I wanted her to know
how much I appreciated it.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.138
So you went back to
thank her, and that's it?

32:33.139 --> 32:35.186
No, not exactly. Uh...

32:35.250 --> 32:37.059
When I got there, she
was reading a script,

32:37.060 --> 32:38.577
and she seemed upset.

32:38.894 --> 32:40.388
I asked her why, and...

32:41.479 --> 32:43.190
She said somebody had betrayed her.

32:43.194 --> 32:44.936
- Who?
- Well, at first, I thought it was me,

32:44.937 --> 32:46.983
for taking the movie role, but then...

32:47.650 --> 32:50.769
she said that someone wasn't who...

32:51.089 --> 32:52.490
she thought they were.

32:52.491 --> 32:54.556
And she didn't let on as
to who this person was?

32:54.738 --> 32:57.936
No. I didn't want to
give her the opportunity

32:57.937 --> 32:59.569
to change her mind
about the movie,

33:00.005 --> 33:03.442
So I exited... Stage left.

33:22.519 --> 33:24.713
Okay, found the deal
memo that Sarah signed

33:24.714 --> 33:27.741
in order to get Lance
out for his movie.

33:29.682 --> 33:30.786
He wasn't lying.

33:31.649 --> 33:33.249
My mother is never
gonna let me forget this.

33:33.250 --> 33:34.649
Oh, come on, Castle.
She'll probably think

33:34.650 --> 33:36.937
it was sweet that you
were concerned about her.

33:36.941 --> 33:38.908
This is Martha Rodgers
we are talking about.

33:38.909 --> 33:41.182
I intruded on her "Moment."

33:41.442 --> 33:44.082
No, I will pay dearly.

33:44.861 --> 33:46.349
When Lance came here,
Sarah told him

33:46.350 --> 33:48.713
that someone wasn't who
she thought they were.

33:48.714 --> 33:50.077
Who do you think that was?

33:50.255 --> 33:52.580
How about the woman who
makes my mother look like a saint?

33:52.581 --> 33:54.876
Yeah, but Sarah already
cut Gloria out of her life.

33:54.877 --> 33:58.024
Maybe...
Maybe it was her cheating husband.

33:58.025 --> 34:01.562
Except Lance met with
Sarah after Mandy Bronson.

34:01.642 --> 34:04.304
By the time Mandy showed up,
Sarah had already decided

34:04.305 --> 34:05.649
what she wanted to
do with her marriage.

34:05.650 --> 34:06.941
Yeah, but even if Sarah decided

34:06.942 --> 34:08.577
that she was gonna get
back together with Vince,

34:08.578 --> 34:10.385
it doesn't mean that
she didn't have doubts.

34:10.386 --> 34:12.321
No. No, you're right.

34:12.917 --> 34:16.025
Except he has an alibi.
Everyone has an alibi.

34:16.025 --> 34:17.326
Yeah, well, somebody
out there doesn't,

34:17.327 --> 34:20.239
and we are gonna find them.
Well, maybe we should sleep on it.

34:22.043 --> 34:23.529
Separately.

34:25.062 --> 34:26.871
Katherine Beckett, I never.

34:30.607 --> 34:31.620
Hello, ladies.

34:31.621 --> 34:32.900
Hey, dad. Gram told me

34:32.900 --> 34:35.609
how you went all Jason
Bourne on her date.

34:35.610 --> 34:38.882
I think I deserve some kudos
for my selfless courage

34:38.882 --> 34:41.340
in the face of perceived danger.

34:41.341 --> 34:42.333
Ah, think what you will.

34:42.335 --> 34:45.745
But I've taken the liberty of
selecting an apology gift

34:45.746 --> 34:48.627
page 47, dog-eared
for your convenience.

34:49.206 --> 34:51.397
- The dress?
- Uh-huh. And the shoes.

34:51.446 --> 34:53.190
Oh! And the purse.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.710
Where did you get this, darling?

34:56.206 --> 34:57.792
Oh, from a woman I met on the case.

34:57.793 --> 34:59.954
She's an aspiring writer. Oh.

35:00.026 --> 35:02.234
In a moment of weakness,
I told her I'd read it.

35:02.327 --> 35:05.266
Oh, it's really pretty good.
She's got very vivid characters,

35:05.267 --> 35:08.113
well plotted, pleasantly salacious.

35:08.114 --> 35:09.634
Great. That's what I'll tell her.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.844
No, no, no, no. You said you
would read it, honey. You.

35:12.964 --> 35:13.760
I will

35:13.761 --> 35:14.476
I just have to do a little

35:14.477 --> 35:17.238
more thinking on the case.
He's procrastinating.

35:17.239 --> 35:18.670
I know. I know. No, I am not.

35:18.671 --> 35:21.916
I am just about to solve a
critical piece of our mystery.

35:21.917 --> 35:25.006
Now that you've determined
that Lance is not the ax murderer?

35:25.502 --> 35:28.118
So what's the critical
piece of evidence, dad?

35:28.119 --> 35:29.593
Well, shortly before she died,

35:29.594 --> 35:31.866
Sarah Cutler said that
someone had betrayed her.

35:32.289 --> 35:33.542
I think that person is our killer.

35:33.543 --> 35:35.273
Well, then it could be anybody, darling,

35:35.274 --> 35:38.933
because betrayal is a way
of life on a soap opera.

35:38.934 --> 35:41.190
And let me tell you, "Temptation Lane"

35:41.191 --> 35:43.634
is like this seething cauldron

35:43.635 --> 35:47.602
of sordidness and treachery
and naked ambition.

35:47.950 --> 35:49.145
And you know which people

35:49.146 --> 35:51.709
are the most manipulative and devious?

35:51.710 --> 35:52.767
I do.

35:54.423 --> 35:55.830
I know who betrayed Sarah.

36:03.858 --> 36:05.237
Look, there's nothing in my contract

36:05.238 --> 36:07.563
that says that I have to
be a cop all of a sudden.

36:07.570 --> 36:09.938
I-I-I've gotta rehearse.

36:10.838 --> 36:12.934
Get off the phone.
Let's do this. Let's go.

36:16.794 --> 36:18.280
Okay, Castle. Let's go.
Oh, wait.

36:18.281 --> 36:19.856
No, hang on.
I just wrote my first soap scene,

36:19.857 --> 36:21.067
which they are about to shoot.

36:21.068 --> 36:23.376
I'll catch it on TV.
We've got an arrest to make.

36:23.377 --> 36:25.949
No, no, wait. This scene is
going to expose the killer.

36:26.161 --> 36:27.852
"The play's the thing wherein we'll catch

36:27.853 --> 36:29.981
the conscience of the King", Hamlet.

36:29.982 --> 36:31.390
We already know who the killer is,

36:31.391 --> 36:34.621
So you're wasting my time me.
Not if I get us a confession.

36:35.154 --> 36:36.780
Places, please.
They're starting. Let's go.

36:36.781 --> 36:38.238
Okay. No, send it back.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.238
Yeah. All right, thanks.

36:40.786 --> 36:42.546
Hey, come on in, guys. Thanks.

36:43.058 --> 36:45.353
Castle, what are we..? Ah, shh, shh.
Just watch, just watch.

36:45.354 --> 36:48.996
Can we close the downstage
door to get better eyes on Mandy,

36:48.997 --> 36:50.411
please? Close those doors!

36:50.750 --> 36:53.333
And clear the set.
Here we go, everybody.

36:53.334 --> 36:55.494
In five... four...

36:55.822 --> 36:57.694
Three... two...

36:59.177 --> 37:00.380
Two's on the line.

37:04.011 --> 37:06.089
Can't you at least knock? I'm changing.

37:06.681 --> 37:08.379
Nothing I haven't seen before...

37:09.321 --> 37:10.939
And enjoyed immensely.

37:11.402 --> 37:12.507
Really?

37:12.798 --> 37:14.781
It's a soap opera.
I had to honor the form.

37:14.782 --> 37:16.206
What are you doing here, Joseph?

37:16.603 --> 37:19.226
If this is about our relationship.
No, it isn't.

37:19.803 --> 37:21.401
It's about your research paper.

37:22.173 --> 37:23.072
The one I had you submit

37:23.073 --> 37:25.749
for the Montenegro Journalism Fellowship.

37:26.461 --> 37:27.934
Is there news about the winner?

37:28.122 --> 37:29.617
The thing about The Fellowship is that

37:29.618 --> 37:32.124
it can open doors, it launches careers.

37:33.915 --> 37:35.290
That's why I recommended you.

37:35.291 --> 37:37.742
Over to one.
So did I win?

37:38.053 --> 37:38.553
Three.

37:38.554 --> 37:39.785
I went to the coffee shop this morning,

37:39.786 --> 37:41.994
and a barista there asked
me to read an article

37:42.078 --> 37:44.638
that she had written
for her college paper.

37:45.738 --> 37:49.406
Oddly enough, it was identical to yours.

37:51.097 --> 37:52.161
There must be some mistake.

37:52.162 --> 37:54.181
Just the one you made in
assuming that you could

37:54.182 --> 37:56.572
pass off somebody else's
material as your own.

37:56.573 --> 37:59.422
You are a fraud, Angela.

37:59.605 --> 38:02.298
And I am going to call The Fellowship

38:02.299 --> 38:03.978
and let them know that exactly.

38:04.811 --> 38:06.365
Oh, and by the way...

38:08.186 --> 38:09.161
you're fired.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.787
And cut.
Nice job, people.

38:12.593 --> 38:13.625
Um...

38:13.626 --> 38:15.117
I don't understand.
This is...

38:15.118 --> 38:17.646
This is not the scene that
we worked on yesterday.

38:17.913 --> 38:19.253
We made some adjustments.

38:19.254 --> 38:21.702
And yet, it has an oddly
familiar ring to it.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.422
Reading other people's
scripts is a part of your job,

38:24.514 --> 38:26.691
- isn't it?
- What are you accusing me of?

38:27.097 --> 38:30.137
Did you not see the scene?
If you're going to be a writer,

38:30.427 --> 38:32.699
you have to have a
better grasp of subtext.

38:34.935 --> 38:36.406
Look, I'm...

38:37.398 --> 38:39.912
I might have mixed up
some of the scripts,

38:39.913 --> 38:42.299
but I was at The Fellowship mixer

38:42.470 --> 38:43.737
the night that Sarah died.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.113
Nobody there remembers
seeing you after 8:00 P.M.

38:46.114 --> 38:48.306
Sarah was killed with an axe, Reese.

38:48.307 --> 38:50.393
Whoever killed her, got
blood on their clothes

38:50.394 --> 38:51.915
and on their shoes.

38:52.253 --> 38:53.911
Some of it invisible to the naked eye,

38:53.912 --> 38:55.805
but it doesn't matter how
much you try to wash it,

38:55.806 --> 38:57.023
it's still there.

38:57.351 --> 38:59.816
I have officers at your apartment.

39:07.298 --> 39:09.185
You have no idea

39:09.186 --> 39:10.562
what I did for her.

39:13.561 --> 39:15.242
Picking up her dogs,

39:15.390 --> 39:17.310
picking up her dry cleaning,

39:17.418 --> 39:19.877
the late nights, the weekends,

39:19.878 --> 39:21.207
no vacation.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.934
You try writing a script
with all of that going on.

39:24.874 --> 39:26.298
I worked too hard

39:26.706 --> 39:28.322
to let it end that way.

39:28.541 --> 39:31.079
I deserved that opportunity,

39:31.080 --> 39:33.960
and I could not let her
take that away from me.

39:36.126 --> 39:37.726
It was never yours to begin with.

39:46.319 --> 39:48.177
Killing Sarah to keep
a lid on her plagiarism?

39:48.178 --> 39:48.720
That's cold.

39:48.744 --> 39:51.714
And pretty ordinary
as far as motives go.

39:52.115 --> 39:52.926
She didn't want to put in the work,

39:52.927 --> 39:55.433
so she took a shortcut.
There are no shortcuts in writing.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.002
Nope, but there is to our favorite bar.

39:57.003 --> 39:58.365
I found a new route that'll get us

39:58.366 --> 40:00.197
to the Old Haunt in eight minutes.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.877
You up for a beer?
Come on. I know the owner.

40:01.890 --> 40:03.787
Yeah, I'm down, bro.
How 'bout you, Castle?

40:04.255 --> 40:05.294
Right behind you.

40:19.758 --> 40:20.703
What?

40:22.533 --> 40:23.685
Got you a present.

40:30.131 --> 40:32.577
A signed cast photo from "Temptation Lane."

40:33.825 --> 40:35.923
How did you even get this?

40:36.393 --> 40:37.834
I know people who know people.

40:42.169 --> 40:43.409
Okay.

40:45.262 --> 40:46.383
I was 9,

40:46.625 --> 40:48.472
and I had to get
my tonsils taken out.

40:48.473 --> 40:49.530
And I was miserable.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.721
And so my mom took time off of work

40:51.722 --> 40:54.513
and... stayed with me

40:54.514 --> 40:57.068
and cuddled up in front of the TV

40:57.069 --> 40:57.800
on the couch,

40:57.801 --> 41:00.236
and we would watch
episodes of "Temptation Lane."

41:01.129 --> 41:02.960
So every time I see it now, it just...

41:02.961 --> 41:07.298
It makes me feel like home and... safe.

41:09.325 --> 41:11.613
So there you go. Judge away.

41:13.748 --> 41:15.715
My DVR...

41:16.638 --> 41:19.278
Would make yours
look like "Masterpiece Theater."

41:19.789 --> 41:21.710
But I am glad to know this about you.

41:36.737 --> 41:37.938
I'll leave you to it.

41:41.111 --> 41:43.125
Hey, Castle.
Thank you for the photo.

41:44.682 --> 41:45.786
I'll see you.

41:48.966 --> 41:50.102
Hey.

41:53.410 --> 41:55.057
After all these years,

41:55.058 --> 41:58.696
all the times I could've been
holding you in my arms...

41:58.697 --> 42:01.194
then let's not waste more time with words.

42:02.750 --> 42:05.521
Let's just let our lips do the talking.

42:05.522 --> 42:06.916
You two running lines again?

42:06.945 --> 42:09.188
Oh. Well, no, no.

42:09.189 --> 42:12.419
We were just, uh...
You know, talking.

42:12.581 --> 42:13.669
Oh.

42:16.103 --> 42:17.089
Oh.

42:17.090 --> 42:19.793
Um... I'm gonna

42:19.794 --> 42:21.058
I'll just...

42:21.209 --> 42:22.665
Go to the...
