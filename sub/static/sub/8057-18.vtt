WEBVTT

00:00.842 --> 00:03.741
Welcome to Animal Control.
Let me show you around.

00:03.860 --> 00:06.406
Those are some chairs.
That's a cat or opossum.

00:06.441 --> 00:09.409
Oh, this is a napkin
where I wrote down

00:09.460 --> 00:12.112
a cool name for a dog.
"Bark Obama."

00:12.146 --> 00:13.330
Right?

00:13.364 --> 00:14.748
Is that--
what's happening here?

00:14.799 --> 00:17.317
Oh. Yo. Yeah.
We found this bird outside.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.186
We tried to turn it
into a work whistle,

00:19.237 --> 00:21.938
like in the beginning
of <i>The Flintstones.</i>

00:21.973 --> 00:23.173
Tougher than it looked, though.

00:23.207 --> 00:25.625
We have a massive pest problem
in this town,

00:25.660 --> 00:27.260
and it's because
the Animal Control Department

00:27.295 --> 00:30.263
has been disaster...
at catching animals.

00:30.298 --> 00:33.834
They're great at ingesting
and selling marijuana.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.385
This place
is a miserable suck hole

00:35.419 --> 00:37.421
run by two pot-head
losers.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.389
It's completely
and utterly mismanaged.

00:39.423 --> 00:40.490
Thanks!

00:40.524 --> 00:42.092
It does seem to be
very poorly run,

00:42.126 --> 00:43.593
but we've only been here
for two minutes.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.195
There may be a method
to their madness.

00:45.229 --> 00:46.863
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

00:46.898 --> 00:48.815
Four. There's four ways
to skin a cat. Regular blade--

00:48.850 --> 00:51.268
Ow!
Ah! What is this?

00:51.302 --> 00:53.787
- Coyote trap, dude.
- Ah! This hurts!

00:53.838 --> 00:55.238
Yeah, we got, like,
a huge vermin problem.

00:55.273 --> 00:56.890
I mean, we've been meaning
to call somebody about it,

00:56.941 --> 00:58.542
but you know,
nobody get on the phone.

00:58.576 --> 01:00.360
You're the people
you would be calling.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.062
That is so trippy.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.364
Ow! You're fired!
You're fired!

01:04.397 --> 01:05.766
The whole department is fired.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.268
Ow, this hurts!
This was one of my running feet!

01:08.302 --> 01:11.188
- Yo, let's go to Jamaica.
- No, we should go to Jamaica.

01:11.222 --> 01:12.139
Oh, is that what you said?

01:12.173 --> 01:14.174
Yeah, dog.

01:36.547 --> 01:39.099
Ron, you've been sweating
in here all day.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.167
Are you drinking any fluids?

01:40.201 --> 01:42.486
Yes, plenty.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.172
No, you need to drink water.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.556
Usually, I take it neat,

01:46.590 --> 01:49.459
but I will make an exception
in the name of health.

01:49.494 --> 01:52.445
Last night, I watched a movie
with Diane and the girls

01:52.480 --> 01:55.816
in which an orange fish
is separated from his father.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.417
The children were sniffling,

01:57.468 --> 02:00.537
which I believed to be due
to the sad nature of the film.

02:00.571 --> 02:04.124
I was wrong.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.892
You need to take off
those layers,

02:05.927 --> 02:07.494
rehydrate,
and go to the doctor.

02:07.528 --> 02:11.031
Thank you for your concern,
I will be fine.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.967
Please turn the thermostat
up to 90 and leave me alone.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.035
Ron, this isn't safe.

02:15.069 --> 02:16.686
I am a grown man.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.306
I have had a cold before,
I need no help,

02:19.340 --> 02:22.025
so if you don't mind--

02:24.428 --> 02:26.546
That seems about right.

02:26.581 --> 02:30.417
Okay, pop quiz.
Name the scent.

02:30.468 --> 02:32.402
Uh, "Spasm."
No, "Butter Face"!

02:32.436 --> 02:34.103
- Very good!
- Yes!

02:34.121 --> 02:35.521
I'm trying to get
more big companies

02:35.539 --> 02:37.240
to donate
to the Sweetums Foundation,

02:37.274 --> 02:39.643
and tom got us a meeting
with Dennis Feinstein,

02:39.677 --> 02:43.013
Pawnee's premiere manufacturer
of perfumes and cologne.

02:45.099 --> 02:47.317
Oh!

02:47.351 --> 02:50.303
Or possibly, insecticide.
Whew!

02:50.338 --> 02:52.722
Dennis Feinstein belongs
to a new generation of wealth--

02:52.756 --> 02:56.309
rappers, tech geniuses,
X games medallists,

02:56.344 --> 02:58.194
and of course,
"scent artists."

02:58.229 --> 03:00.797
The man owns a Rolexus.

03:00.815 --> 03:02.165
It's a Lexus
filled with Rolexes.

03:02.199 --> 03:03.166
What's the point of that?

03:03.200 --> 03:05.301
To have it, which he does.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.487
Okay, I'll lay out
the benefits of donating.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.056
Tom will flatter and schmooze
as only tom can.

03:10.091 --> 03:12.092
Andy, you know, this is just
a learning experience for you,

03:12.126 --> 03:13.593
so you just watch and listen.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.729
I had to pull a lot of strings
to get this meeting,

03:15.780 --> 03:17.497
so please, no one embarrass me.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.400
Ben, put on something decent,
like a tux.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.003
Andy, you're hopeless,
just take a shower.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.905
I already took what I call
a "dwyer shower."

03:24.939 --> 03:28.692
I rubbed my armpits
with air fresheners.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.377
New car.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.613
Animal control
has long been a repository

03:33.648 --> 03:36.750
for some of this government's
most incompetent employees.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.335
Jerry Gergich
got his start there.

03:38.369 --> 03:39.703
- Well.
- All right, well.

03:39.737 --> 03:41.888
Yeah, so our new director
needs to be competent,

03:41.923 --> 03:44.274
effective, and not completely
stoned all the time.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.609
I'm way ahead of you
there, girly.

03:45.643 --> 03:46.743
I got the perfect guy.

03:46.777 --> 03:49.512
Friend of mine,
bit of an alcoholic,

03:49.530 --> 03:52.499
a little grabby, either
a war hero or war criminal,

03:52.533 --> 03:54.968
depending on who you ask,
but a good dude.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.736
- How do you know him?
- I do his teeth.

03:56.771 --> 04:00.807
A few coffee stains up front,
but his canines are insane.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.109
Gosh, Jeremy,
he sounds perfect.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.211
- Are his gums great too?
- Oh, yeah.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.447
They are excellent, beet red.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.682
I was being sarcastic.

04:08.716 --> 04:09.983
I think we should open this
to the floor

04:10.017 --> 04:13.236
- for more discussion.
- Uh, maybe you would like

04:13.270 --> 04:15.055
to explain this to her,
please?

04:15.089 --> 04:17.257
Traditionally, Leslie,
the councilmen just

04:17.291 --> 04:19.175
kind of take turns
on departmental appointments.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.762
Yeah, this one is mine,
then Dexhart, then you.

04:22.797 --> 04:24.347
This whole place runs on dibs.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.916
Are you kidding me?
You guys are all fine with this?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.019
Well, Milton's asleep,
but the rest of you?

04:29.053 --> 04:30.687
This is how departments
get mismanaged.

04:30.721 --> 04:32.355
No. We are going to be
thorough.

04:32.390 --> 04:33.957
I'm going to find a candidate,

04:33.991 --> 04:35.511
and I encourage you all
to do the same,

04:35.543 --> 04:37.677
and then, we will interview
all of them.

04:37.712 --> 04:38.812
Boring!

04:38.846 --> 04:41.031
"Boring"
is my middle name, so...

04:41.065 --> 04:43.016
my thoroughly vetted candidate

04:43.050 --> 04:44.701
is going to blow your candidate
out of the water.

04:44.735 --> 04:48.555
Oh, I guess I'm leaving.
Good to see you. Great meeting!

04:48.589 --> 04:50.490
I'd like to object again

04:50.524 --> 04:52.709
to being brought here
against my will.

04:52.743 --> 04:54.561
Okay, I'm just gonna
double-check your form here.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.514
Ron! You redacted
all the information.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.015
- I answered some of them.
- For "date of birth,"

04:59.033 --> 05:00.200
you wrote "springtime."

05:00.234 --> 05:02.435
- Which is true.
- Everything you write down

05:02.470 --> 05:03.553
is confidential.

05:03.587 --> 05:05.038
We need you
to give real answers.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.406
Fine.

05:06.457 --> 05:08.274
How many drinks of alcohol
do you consume a week?

05:08.309 --> 05:10.410
- One.
- That's it, one drink?

05:10.461 --> 05:12.629
One shelf.

05:12.663 --> 05:15.015
- Do you exercise?
- Yes.

05:15.049 --> 05:16.833
Lovemaking and woodworking.

05:16.867 --> 05:19.402
Do you have any history of
mental illness in your family?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.521
I have an uncle who does yoga.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.874
- Allergies?
- Cowardice and weak-willed men.

05:24.909 --> 05:25.892
And hazelnuts.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.009
Sexual history.

05:27.028 --> 05:29.129
Epic and private.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.765
Okay. I'm gonna go
get your doctor.

05:31.799 --> 05:35.835
He's a rude, brash jerk.
You'll love him.

05:35.870 --> 05:37.454
I'm gonna cut
right to the chase.

05:37.488 --> 05:39.806
I don't like charity.
I don't get it.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.975
Feels to me like
I'm giving money away,

05:42.009 --> 05:43.693
and getting nothing in return.

05:43.728 --> 05:44.894
Well, that's not true.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.546
You can really help
your personal brand

05:46.580 --> 05:49.949
if you show that you're a mogul
that gives as much as he gets.

05:49.984 --> 05:52.519
If I give as much as I get,
I'm giving $20 million.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.121
Ay yi yi.

05:55.156 --> 05:57.874
That's how much I'm worth,
20...million...dollars.

05:57.908 --> 05:59.642
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:01.011 --> 06:04.147
Ah, he's disgusting,
but I want to take his money

06:04.181 --> 06:05.432
and give it to needy people,

06:05.466 --> 06:08.835
so I'm just gonna
keep on smiling. Yay!

06:10.805 --> 06:14.240
People who give to charity,
they get amazing press.

06:14.275 --> 06:15.775
- Huh.
- Like Bill Gates.

06:15.810 --> 06:18.078
Have you ever
heard of Bill Gates?

06:18.112 --> 06:20.880
He lives in Seattle,
guy with glasses.

06:20.931 --> 06:21.848
Bill Gates?

06:21.899 --> 06:23.616
I know who Bill Gates is.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.085
Bill Gates is, like,
a super nerd.

06:25.136 --> 06:27.904
Is this some sort of nerd thing?
Are you calling me a nerd?

06:27.938 --> 06:29.772
Uh, he meant Mark Cuban.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.342
Cuban?
Now, that's the kind of guy

06:32.376 --> 06:33.793
I can hang out with--
Mark Cuban.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.161
- Yeah.
- I'm interested now.

06:35.196 --> 06:36.746
Keep talking.

06:36.781 --> 06:38.181
Stay still.

06:38.215 --> 06:40.366
"Don't think about
how much this itches."

06:40.401 --> 06:41.501
That's very good advice.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.785
I have to say, this is

06:42.803 --> 06:44.737
the greatest search committee
ever assembled

06:44.772 --> 06:46.573
to find a new Animal Control
Department head.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.208
Chris Traeger can do more
with one foot

06:48.242 --> 06:49.492
than most people can do
with three.

06:49.527 --> 06:51.427
I'm not going to lie to you.
I needed that.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.529
I know.

06:52.563 --> 06:54.247
- April Ludgate is beautiful...
- Stop.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.715
- You are talented...
- No.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.650
But most importantly, you're
passionate about animals.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.953
That's true.
It's because I'm half wolf.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.005
Okay, Donna, you took
a look at all the resumes,

07:02.039 --> 07:03.439
so send in the best candidate.

07:03.474 --> 07:06.442
Wassup? I'm Harris.
I'm 33 years young.

07:06.476 --> 07:09.395
I have my cousin Jason's truck
for two more weeks.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.014
I have one testicle--
whac-a-mole accident--

07:12.032 --> 07:13.983
and I'm down to clown.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.704
Harris, we know who you are.
I literally just fired you.

07:17.738 --> 07:21.825
Oh, is this that job?
That's crazy! Never mind.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.244
Why would you think Harris
would be the best candidate?

07:24.278 --> 07:26.229
'Cause he's one
of only two applicants

07:26.247 --> 07:28.248
with actual experience
at animal control.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.415
Uh-ohh.
Does that mean--

07:29.450 --> 07:32.001
What up?
Yo, my name is Brett.

07:32.036 --> 07:35.738
I like burgers, and also,
I'm very high right now.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.741
- Dude, this is hilarious!
- Oh, yo!

07:40.244 --> 07:42.745
- We live together!
- Yo, we live in the same place!

07:42.763 --> 07:46.683
- This is my boy!
- Hey, "Wyld Stallyns"!

07:46.717 --> 07:48.935
You guys know why there are
all those cops out there?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.553
Where are the cops at?

07:50.587 --> 07:52.772
- I gotta go.
- Yo.

07:56.193 --> 07:58.587
A lot of charities waste their money
on overhead,

07:58.707 --> 08:00.182
but we at the Sweetums Foundation,

08:00.302 --> 08:01.919
- spend our money wisely.
- Okay.

08:01.954 --> 08:03.838
- You know what? Shut up.
- All right.

08:03.872 --> 08:05.289
You guys seem like
pretty cool dudes

08:05.324 --> 08:07.842
and I'm feeling pretty generous,
so why don't we

08:07.876 --> 08:10.277
take this conversation
to the Pawnee Smokehouse?

08:10.295 --> 08:11.596
Dumb-Dumb Eddie,
get the checkbook.

08:11.630 --> 08:12.880
We're going out.

08:12.898 --> 08:14.248
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:14.283 --> 08:15.616
Guys, we're going out.
Let's scent up!

08:15.651 --> 08:17.752
I call dibs on "Ooze."

08:17.786 --> 08:20.037
- I got "Money Shot."
- Yeah.

08:20.072 --> 08:21.072
I got "Blood Spurt."

08:21.106 --> 08:22.289
Ooh, no, don't use that one.

08:22.307 --> 08:23.925
Eh, go ahead.

08:23.959 --> 08:26.127
So why do you want this job?

08:26.145 --> 08:29.881
Well, I love cats,
and dogs sure are great.

08:29.915 --> 08:31.732
Well, you have
all the qualifications.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.217
You went
to a four-year college.

08:33.268 --> 08:35.318
Actually, when I went there,
it was just a two-year college.

08:35.370 --> 08:37.554
Wow, so you're not even
technically qualified

08:37.589 --> 08:39.590
to work at your current job.

08:39.625 --> 08:40.957
Aw, geez.

08:40.993 --> 08:42.827
- You're fired. Get out.
- No, no, you're not fired,

08:42.861 --> 08:44.912
but we're definitely going to
have to lower your salary.

08:44.930 --> 08:46.697
Oh, well, fair's fair.

08:46.732 --> 08:51.235
I am very, very, very,
very frightened of animals.

08:51.286 --> 08:53.337
This may not be
the job for you.

08:53.388 --> 08:55.573
I know, but my therapist,
Dr. Richard Nygard,

08:55.607 --> 08:56.958
told me to confront my fears.

08:56.992 --> 09:00.111
You see Dr. Richard Nygard?
I'm a Nygardian too!

09:00.145 --> 09:02.130
Would you sign my cast?

09:02.164 --> 09:03.714
Yes, but just please
don't give me this job.

09:03.749 --> 09:05.733
The spaying
and neutering tools,

09:05.767 --> 09:07.435
do you think those fit humans?

09:07.469 --> 09:09.320
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
- And is there a lock

09:09.354 --> 09:10.304
on the spaying room door?

09:10.339 --> 09:11.405
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

09:11.423 --> 09:12.757
Thank you so much
for coming in.

09:12.791 --> 09:14.525
- Thanks for having me.
- Okay.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.728
Hello, Orin. Thank you so much
for applying, now leave.

09:17.763 --> 09:19.263
Hey, give him a chance.

09:19.298 --> 09:21.265
What makes you qualified
for animal control?

09:21.300 --> 09:23.818
I studied zoology in college,

09:23.852 --> 09:26.771
and I can control animals
with my mind.

09:26.805 --> 09:30.758
- Get out.
- I made you say that.

09:31.860 --> 09:33.127
I liked him.

09:33.162 --> 09:34.428
Well, that was

09:34.463 --> 09:36.564
a truly depressing
slate of candidates.

09:36.598 --> 09:38.199
I think you've got
several options.

09:38.233 --> 09:40.418
They're all terrible,
but you have them.

09:40.452 --> 09:43.070
Before you begin,
a few ground rules.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.189
I need you to explain
everything you do

09:45.224 --> 09:47.208
before you do it,
so I can determine

09:47.242 --> 09:48.376
whether I will allow you--

09:48.410 --> 09:49.310
Oh!

09:50.646 --> 09:51.863
Ugh!

09:51.897 --> 09:54.832
Balsa wood?
You could at least use mahogany.

09:59.488 --> 10:01.706
There's something
occluding your ear.

10:01.757 --> 10:03.591
It's sawdust.
Just blow.

10:04.726 --> 10:06.794
- Oh.
- You've got strep throat.

10:06.828 --> 10:09.347
I'm writing you
a prescription for penicillin.

10:09.398 --> 10:10.765
We'll have the rest
of your test results

10:10.799 --> 10:12.233
in about 20 minutes.
Cholesterol--

10:12.267 --> 10:15.136
Not interested.
Good day.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.541
Wish all patients
were like that.

10:20.559 --> 10:23.044
It's really annoying
when they ask questions.

10:23.078 --> 10:24.345
You know,

10:24.379 --> 10:25.947
they claim that smoking
is bad for you,

10:25.981 --> 10:27.932
but is there
any medical evidence

10:27.966 --> 10:29.483
to back that up?

10:29.518 --> 10:32.019
- Great point.
- So the Sweetums Foundation

10:32.037 --> 10:33.654
has really accomplished
a lot recently.

10:33.689 --> 10:35.556
Our health care
outreach program

10:35.591 --> 10:37.408
has reduced pink eye
in the rural community

10:37.459 --> 10:39.827
by 30%...

10:39.845 --> 10:41.212
to 70%.

10:41.246 --> 10:43.631
Snooze. You guys
ever been fox hunting?

10:43.665 --> 10:46.234
I have my own foxes
flown in from Russia.

10:46.268 --> 10:49.287
We drug them pretty heavily
so they can't get very far.

10:49.321 --> 10:52.039
In fact, mostly, they just
flop around on the ground.

10:52.074 --> 10:54.258
Makes it easier
to just walk up and "pow!"

10:55.694 --> 10:58.879
Stupid foxes.
It's deeply erotic.

10:58.897 --> 10:59.947
That sounds amazing.

10:59.982 --> 11:01.465
We should go hunting sometime.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.833
I'd love to.

11:02.868 --> 11:05.453
I could bust out my Ralph Lauren
Fall 2010 collection.

11:05.487 --> 11:08.139
Copped it in 2012.
Clearance rack!

11:08.173 --> 11:09.423
Wear whatever you want,

11:09.441 --> 11:12.510
as long as it's not too bright
or reflective.

11:12.544 --> 11:15.896
You know, I want you
blending in to the surroundings.

11:15.931 --> 11:18.115
How fast can you run?

11:18.150 --> 11:20.084
I think that guy
wants to hunt me.

11:20.118 --> 11:21.669
So, Dennis,
not to interrupt--

11:21.703 --> 11:23.788
Then don't.
Boom! Ha ha!

11:23.822 --> 11:25.439
Shut him right down!

11:25.474 --> 11:28.109
I have heard so much talking
from you.

11:28.143 --> 11:30.895
I don't want to hear your
fat mouth say anything else.

11:30.929 --> 11:32.096
- Boo!
- Oh.

11:34.816 --> 11:35.800
You're a dick.

11:35.834 --> 11:38.035
Excuse me?

11:38.070 --> 11:39.003
- Andy--
- How dare you

11:39.037 --> 11:40.137
talk to me like that?

11:40.172 --> 11:41.222
Where are your manners?

11:41.256 --> 11:42.857
You come to me
asking for money,

11:42.891 --> 11:44.842
and you treat me like this?
I don't think so.

11:44.876 --> 11:47.194
Wrap it up! We're done!

11:47.229 --> 11:50.881
Hey!
Show these garbage people out!

11:50.916 --> 11:54.185
Take the garbage out, Eddie.

11:54.236 --> 11:56.203
Donna?

11:56.237 --> 11:58.356
Gentlemen.

11:59.741 --> 12:03.477
Mr. Palletta, what is
your occupation currently?

12:03.512 --> 12:05.396
I run a children's
break dancing studio

12:05.430 --> 12:07.315
called
"D.J. Jazzy Vern's."

12:07.349 --> 12:08.733
Do you have any experience
with animals?

12:08.767 --> 12:10.801
Uh, a bat
landed on my face once.

12:10.836 --> 12:12.436
Hey, you know what,
he's not a rack of ribs,

12:12.471 --> 12:15.222
so stop grilling him.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.324
Nailed it.

12:16.358 --> 12:17.792
Ribs are better smoked
than grilled,

12:17.826 --> 12:19.910
so un-nailed it, with
the back part of the hammer.

12:19.945 --> 12:21.862
How many more questions
are there gonna be?

12:21.896 --> 12:23.381
Jamm said
if I got my teeth whitened,

12:23.415 --> 12:24.949
- I'd just get the gig.
- Uh, ga ga ga--ho.

12:24.983 --> 12:27.385
Hold up, that's enough.
Thank you, you're done.

12:27.419 --> 12:28.736
You did a heck of a job,
Vernie.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.121
Thanks, Jimbo.

12:30.155 --> 12:32.773
Not bad, right? I mean,
if he can catch raccoons

12:32.791 --> 12:35.142
as well as he can teach
six-year-olds to pop and lock,

12:35.177 --> 12:36.560
he's a home run.

12:36.611 --> 12:38.295
That is an insane statement.

12:38.330 --> 12:41.349
Well,
I don't see anyone better.

12:41.383 --> 12:45.169
April, I got a present for you.

12:45.203 --> 12:46.837
I don't like lotion.
I like my hands

12:46.888 --> 12:49.123
to be cracked and calloused
like a railway worker.

12:49.157 --> 12:51.575
I know. I filled the bottles
with fake blood,

12:51.610 --> 12:52.743
vinegar, and mud.

12:52.778 --> 12:56.013
- Really? Thanks.
- On an unrelated note,

12:56.064 --> 12:57.314
do you remember
all those candidates

12:57.349 --> 12:59.600
we were interviewing
for the Animal Control job

12:59.634 --> 13:01.469
and how they were all
total losers

13:01.503 --> 13:02.603
who didn't care about animals?

13:02.637 --> 13:04.171
Except for Jerry,
who was great,

13:04.189 --> 13:05.790
but who we had to pass on
for other reasons.

13:05.824 --> 13:07.858
I was just happy
to be considered.

13:07.893 --> 13:10.811
Anyhoo, I nominated you
for the position,

13:10.845 --> 13:12.763
and your confirmation hearing
is in three minutes.

13:12.798 --> 13:14.832
- Surprise.
- No, I don't want the job.

13:14.866 --> 13:16.384
You can have
your mud and blood back.

13:16.418 --> 13:18.169
April, please,
you will be so good at it.

13:18.203 --> 13:19.487
You are so good with animals.

13:19.521 --> 13:21.021
Even if I wanted the job,
I don't want to do

13:21.039 --> 13:22.556
the stupid
confirmation hearing, okay?

13:22.591 --> 13:24.558
Stupid councilmen
asking me stupid questions

13:24.576 --> 13:25.993
about my stupid life--
it seems stupid.

13:26.011 --> 13:28.479
No, it's easy--they'll just
ask you a few questions.

13:28.513 --> 13:29.880
Let's practice.
What's your name?

13:29.915 --> 13:31.498
Batman.
See? I failed.

13:31.516 --> 13:33.184
I will be there
to help you, okay?

13:33.218 --> 13:34.501
I will be your Pocahontas.

13:34.519 --> 13:36.971
Climb into my papoose.
Please do this.

13:37.005 --> 13:38.556
Please, please.
Do it. Do it. Do it.

13:38.607 --> 13:39.890
- Do it. You're gonna do it.
- Okay.

13:39.941 --> 13:42.526
- Yes! Yay!
- But only if you divorce Ben.

13:42.561 --> 13:43.882
Hey, don't even joke
about that.

13:43.895 --> 13:46.346
What? I really think
he's wrong for you.

13:48.521 --> 13:51.101
We now resume the confirmation
proceedings

13:51.221 --> 13:53.279
for director of
the Animal Control Department.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.642
Okay. Let's tear this chick
a new one, shall we?

13:56.677 --> 13:59.261
Ms. Ludgate,
we have found many emails

13:59.296 --> 14:01.580
showing
how you sexually harassed

14:01.615 --> 14:02.915
Leslie Knope's assistant.

14:02.949 --> 14:05.167
Andy?
That's my husband.

14:05.185 --> 14:06.986
They were still
extremely graphic,

14:07.020 --> 14:08.554
and appreciated by all of us.

14:08.588 --> 14:11.757
I had never heard of several
of those terms, and I'm a freak.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.926
Those are personal.
No one's allowed to read those.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.961
You once posted
a video of yourself

14:16.012 --> 14:18.013
drinking alcohol in City Hall

14:18.031 --> 14:20.633
while you were still a minor.
How do you justify that?

14:20.684 --> 14:24.220
Easily.
Alcohol is delicious and fun...

14:24.254 --> 14:27.189
...Damentally a substance
that should not be abused.

14:27.223 --> 14:28.674
I agree, April.
Very good point.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.644
Wow. Ms. Ludgate,
are you a ventriloquist?

14:31.678 --> 14:33.179
I mean, that is amazing
how you make

14:33.213 --> 14:35.898
your words come out
of Ms. Knope's mouth.

14:35.932 --> 14:37.266
Would you like
to put her on your knee?

14:37.284 --> 14:38.601
I mean, that'd be really fun.

14:38.635 --> 14:39.802
Just three years ago,
you drove--

14:39.836 --> 14:41.036
She's not ready.

14:41.071 --> 14:42.855
Now, you've rushed her
into this,

14:42.906 --> 14:44.774
and now, Jamm's
sharpening the knives.

14:44.808 --> 14:47.760
Leslie, no one needs
to be jammed today.

14:47.794 --> 14:50.679
Okay, all we need
is some kind of distraction.

14:50.714 --> 14:52.531
Grab that gavel
and break your other foot.

14:52.566 --> 14:54.900
I like the idea
of double the signings,

14:54.935 --> 14:56.469
but I think the negatives
outweigh the positives.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.404
Don't panic.
Maybe she can pull this off.

14:58.438 --> 15:00.673
I guess my first move
as director would be

15:00.707 --> 15:03.275
to fill your office, house,
and car with snakes,

15:03.310 --> 15:05.177
and then train a crow
to fly up your butt.

15:05.212 --> 15:07.997
Okay!
Let's take a brief recess.

15:08.031 --> 15:10.633
Well, well, well.
Look who's back.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.669
Thank you so much
for seeing us again, sir.

15:13.703 --> 15:16.372
We just came to apologize.

15:16.406 --> 15:18.307
Mr. Dennis Feinstein,

15:18.341 --> 15:20.776
let me just say,
from the bottom of my heart,

15:20.811 --> 15:22.261
my bad.

15:22.295 --> 15:23.562
I just started working here,

15:23.597 --> 15:28.217
and I really want to do
a good job, and I blew it.

15:30.787 --> 15:32.054
Thank you for saying that.

15:32.088 --> 15:33.973
Thought about it last night,
and I decided

15:34.024 --> 15:37.877
that if you came in here
and apologized to me like a man,

15:37.911 --> 15:40.429
that I would forgive you,
and that's what you've done,

15:40.464 --> 15:41.914
so you're forgiven.

15:41.965 --> 15:47.286
To that end, here is a check
for $25,000 for your charity.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.355
- Oh!
- Go out there

15:49.389 --> 15:50.909
and help some kids
with their pink eye,

15:50.941 --> 15:52.381
or whatever it is
you guys are doing.

15:52.392 --> 15:54.844
Mr. Feinstein, thank you.
This is extremely generous.

15:54.878 --> 15:56.395
It's nothing, really.
I'm happy to help.

15:56.429 --> 15:59.715
This check is made out
to "Go [bleep] yourself."

15:59.749 --> 16:01.150
In your face!

16:01.184 --> 16:04.103
Dennis Feinstein helps no man!

16:04.137 --> 16:06.138
Get the hell out of my office!

16:06.173 --> 16:07.456
- Hey, what's your problem, man?
- Why did you make me

16:07.474 --> 16:08.557
- apologize to him?
- Guys, guys, just hold it--

16:08.592 --> 16:09.608
hold on a sec, okay?

16:09.643 --> 16:11.327
Mr. Feinstein,

16:11.361 --> 16:14.013
with all due respect...

16:14.047 --> 16:15.447
you are a major dick.

16:15.499 --> 16:16.782
- What?
- Run!

16:16.833 --> 16:19.168
- Eddie, get my crossbow.
- Crossbow? What the--

16:19.202 --> 16:21.854
You will pay for this!

16:21.905 --> 16:23.639
Hey, you look better.

16:23.673 --> 16:25.808
I guess actual medicine
can be effective.

16:25.842 --> 16:26.775
Who'da thunk?

16:26.810 --> 16:28.010
Please leave me alone.

16:28.044 --> 16:29.645
Not until we go over
your test results

16:29.679 --> 16:30.863
and your blood work.

16:30.897 --> 16:32.848
Your blood pressure looks fine.

16:32.883 --> 16:34.266
I'm not sure
how this is possible,

16:34.301 --> 16:35.651
but your cholesterol is 120,

16:35.685 --> 16:36.969
which is the lowest
I've ever seen.

16:37.003 --> 16:38.470
What's "cholesterol"?

16:38.505 --> 16:40.923
And the only problem I see
is that your potassium's low,

16:40.957 --> 16:42.858
so just eat a banana
once in awhile.

16:42.893 --> 16:45.828
No, thank you.
I live the way I live,

16:45.862 --> 16:49.798
I eat the things I eat,
and I'll die the way I'll die.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.551
That's oddly beautiful...
but also stupid.

16:52.586 --> 16:54.486
You're not alone in the world
anymore, Ron.

16:54.538 --> 16:58.741
You're dating a woman who has
two kids, so every three days,

16:58.775 --> 17:01.076
think about Ivy and Zoe
and Diane,

17:01.111 --> 17:04.079
and eat a damn banana.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.068
I am so sorry, April.

17:09.118 --> 17:11.520
You are doing terribly up there,
and it's all my fault.

17:11.555 --> 17:13.122
It's not you, it's me.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.540
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I'm breaking up with the idea

17:15.592 --> 17:17.643
of you being director
of Animal Control.

17:17.694 --> 17:19.712
I say we just
withdraw your application

17:19.746 --> 17:22.798
and let Vern become director.
He does have good teeth.

17:22.832 --> 17:24.516
No!

17:24.550 --> 17:27.786
All right, I have an idea.
Trust me.

17:27.837 --> 17:31.640
Ms. Ludgate, it is the opinion
of this committee

17:31.675 --> 17:33.392
that you are terrible.

17:33.426 --> 17:36.311
Can you give me even one reason

17:36.329 --> 17:38.063
why you're the right man
for this job?

17:38.098 --> 17:40.900
No.
But neither is your guy.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.451
Neither of us
should get the job.

17:42.485 --> 17:44.436
Oh, no?
Why is that?

17:44.471 --> 17:46.589
There shouldn't be a separate
Animal Control Department.

17:46.623 --> 17:48.991
Its budget is tiny,
and it's ineffective,

17:49.025 --> 17:51.443
and frankly,
no one could change that.

17:51.478 --> 17:54.330
So I think it should be absorbed
into the Parks Department.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.148
That is a genius idea.

17:56.182 --> 17:58.934
Somebody wake up Milton.
History is being made.

17:58.968 --> 18:00.185
Iwo Jima!

18:00.220 --> 18:02.137
Animal Control would be
way more effective

18:02.172 --> 18:03.505
if it ran
through the Parks Department,

18:03.523 --> 18:06.041
and if you want, I can
write up an official report

18:06.076 --> 18:07.376
in language simple enough

18:07.410 --> 18:09.895
for even you dummies
to understand, dummies.

18:09.946 --> 18:11.196
Councilman,
you have to admit that

18:11.247 --> 18:12.514
that idea makes a lot of sense.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.867
Hang on a second.
You seem to be forgetting

18:14.901 --> 18:17.219
that I already told Vern
he got the job,

18:17.237 --> 18:18.737
and he already bought
a new speedboat.

18:18.788 --> 18:20.506
Well, I hope he kept a receipt.

18:20.540 --> 18:23.592
That was a brilliant idea
from a dark, tortured genius,

18:23.610 --> 18:27.062
and I move that Animal Control
be absorbed into Parks and Rec.

18:27.097 --> 18:29.131
I second that.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.717
Yay!

18:31.751 --> 18:34.837
Look at that, April.
You won over Jamm.

18:34.871 --> 18:36.171
Uh, no, she didn't.

18:36.205 --> 18:38.040
I'm just sick of being
on the losing side.

18:38.058 --> 18:41.710
I'm going to tell everyone
this was my idea.

18:41.728 --> 18:43.512
Retro-jammed.

18:46.969 --> 18:49.201
What do we do now?
Can I apologize again?

18:49.280 --> 18:50.760
I'm getting really
at apologizing.

18:50.794 --> 18:52.428
Screw that.
You should apologize

18:52.462 --> 18:53.979
for apologizing to that guy.

18:54.014 --> 18:55.598
God, we really could've used
the money, though.

18:55.632 --> 18:57.466
Just wish we'd made
a bigger impression.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.902
You did--
I was really impressed

18:59.936 --> 19:01.320
by all the stuff
the foundation's done

19:01.355 --> 19:04.156
for all them poor homies,
so you know what?

19:04.191 --> 19:06.325
Rent-A-Swag is gonna
donate five cents

19:06.360 --> 19:08.327
from every dollar
we make this month.

19:08.362 --> 19:10.145
It's not Feinstein money,
but it'll help.

19:10.163 --> 19:12.131
That's very generous, Tom.

19:12.165 --> 19:14.300
Feinstein's the worst.
I hope he gets into an accident

19:14.334 --> 19:16.419
driving that Rolex Mobile.

19:16.453 --> 19:18.087
For the last time,
it's a Rolexus,

19:18.121 --> 19:19.672
and you can't drive it.

19:19.706 --> 19:23.626
April, I have a gift
for you. Ta da.

19:23.660 --> 19:26.462
At Leslie's suggestion,
I have made you deputy director

19:26.496 --> 19:29.298
of Animal Control
within the Parks Department.

19:29.332 --> 19:31.434
You'll be amazing at it,
and the best part,

19:31.468 --> 19:32.685
there is no
confirmation hearing.

19:32.719 --> 19:34.770
How did you make this plaque
so quickly?

19:34.805 --> 19:36.305
I had it made
your first week here.

19:36.339 --> 19:40.559
I knew you'd be going places,
so I wanted to be prepared.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.278
- Can I hire an intern?
- Not yet.

19:42.312 --> 19:43.946
- Can I hire a Mexican elf?
- No.

19:43.980 --> 19:45.564
- Can I buy a child bride?
- No.

19:45.615 --> 19:47.533
Then how is this even
a promotion?

19:47.567 --> 19:49.819
Government shouldn't operate
based on personal favors.

19:49.853 --> 19:52.020
It should operate
based on good ideas.

19:52.038 --> 19:55.408
April had the best idea,
and today the best idea won.

19:55.459 --> 19:57.326
Leslie, I really have to
go to the bathroom.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.194
Oh, yeah, right, sorry.

19:59.212 --> 20:00.212
You don't have to
come in with me.

20:00.247 --> 20:03.031
I wasn't going to.

20:03.049 --> 20:04.250
Could you pick up the pace
a little bit?

20:04.301 --> 20:06.302
Oh, yes, Miss Daisy.

20:06.336 --> 20:08.671
- Night, Ron.
- Night, Ron.

20:22.552 --> 20:25.054
Ladies, ladies.
