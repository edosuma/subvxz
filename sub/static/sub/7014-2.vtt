WEBVTT

00:06.381 --> 00:10.302
All right, Donna put your chair here.
I wanna get Steven's attention,

00:10.385 --> 00:15.390
and with you next to me I'll look
like a tiny porcelain doll.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.394
Y'know Jackie, some people actually
find me to be of normal height.

00:19.394 --> 00:23.273
Sure if they're green and jolly.
- I can't take it.

00:23.357 --> 00:28.362
Watching Donna lie out, knowing she's gonna
go to college and I have to stay here,

00:28.362 --> 00:30.364
She's so, so...

00:30.364 --> 00:34.368
Juicy.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.371
My Juicy.

00:37.371 --> 00:41.375
Well I'm not gonna stay here locked in
the house just cause Jackie looks...

00:41.375 --> 00:45.379
ridiculously hot in
that bathing suit.

00:45.379 --> 00:50.300
Later Forman.
- Bye bye juicy.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.388
Ladies.  Ladies bodies.

00:54.388 --> 00:59.351
I wish someone would rub lotion on my
shoulders. Think they're getting a little red.

00:59.393 --> 01:05.649
Yeah, you should be careful.
Looks like you're starting to scab.

01:06.358 --> 01:11.363
Oh, that's a burn about a burn.
That's a second degree burn!

01:11.363 --> 01:14.366
Y'know Jackie,
I think maybe Hyde's moved on.

01:14.366 --> 01:18.370
No, no, no. You don't just move
on from Jackie Burkhardt.

01:18.370 --> 01:22.374
I'm like the bottle, you need a twelve
step program to break my spell.

01:22.374 --> 01:28.380
Okay ladies.  All these sound waves
are interfering with my sunrays.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.382
Let's tan.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.384
Alright, I'm gonna need you to
lotion me up, darling,

01:32.384 --> 01:37.389
but only rub where you
can see. No roaming!

01:45.355 --> 01:49.526

02:22.392 --> 02:25.354
Hey, Mom, Dad,
I have something I wanna tell you.

02:25.354 --> 02:30.359
I've decided not to move away.
- What?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.905
I'm gonna stay and put off
college for just a little while

02:34.947 --> 02:40.369
or at least until you're well enough to go back
to work. - My baby, my baby, my baby.

02:40.369 --> 02:46.291
Mom okay, this is actually kind of embarrassing. 
You're actually really hurting me, yeah.

02:46.375 --> 02:50.379
You mean I've been waiting eighteen years
for you to get your butt out of this house,

02:50.379 --> 02:53.382
and now you're staying?

02:53.382 --> 02:58.387
I signed over my pay check to you.
I want you to go buy yourself something pretty.

02:58.387 --> 03:02.391
Or I don't know...
electricity.

03:02.391 --> 03:06.395
Oh honey, thank you.

03:06.395 --> 03:12.651
Red it wouldn't kill you to thank him.
- It might I just had a heart attack.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.281
Speaking of which,
I just found this in the garbage.

03:17.364 --> 03:21.368
Why would you throw away the list of all the food
the doctor said we couldn't have in the house?

03:21.368 --> 03:23.370
Kitty did you look at that list?

03:23.370 --> 03:26.373
If I had known what I was coming
home to after my heart attack,

03:26.373 --> 03:31.378
 I would've walked straight into that
bright light and never looked back.

03:32.379 --> 03:37.384
Oh come on,
it can't be that bad.

03:37.384 --> 03:43.390
I'll do it with you.  Cause what's good for
the goose, is good for the gander.

03:43.390 --> 03:47.561
Actually, Mom,
Dad's the gander.

03:48.395 --> 03:53.567
The male goose.  So it would be what's good
for the gander is good for the goose.

03:56.361 --> 04:01.366
Let's take a gander at what
you're giving up with the gander.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.328
That's how you do that.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.372
Potato chips, other salty snacks.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.375
Good advice, that doctor obviously
knows what he's talking about.

04:10.375 --> 04:14.338
Butter, heavy cream, cheese.
- Gone, makes a lot of sense.

04:14.379 --> 04:18.175
Alcoholic beverages.
- Okay, that doctor's a quack.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.310
God, it's gonna be so hard
going off to college without you.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.354
But we'll see each other
on the weekends right?

04:30.354 --> 04:32.356
Well you say that now,
but then there's that weekend

04:32.356 --> 04:34.358
when you call home and
say you have to study

04:34.358 --> 04:39.363
but I here Moose, the place kicker in the background,
asking if you want another shot of tequila.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.366
Eric, that would never happen.

04:42.366 --> 04:46.954
I would never date a place kicker,
it's Quarterback or nothing for me.

04:49.373 --> 04:54.378
The more I think about
leaving you, the sadder I get.

04:54.378 --> 04:57.798
And the sadder I get,
the more I wanna be with you.

04:58.382 --> 05:03.303
Right now.
- Now?

05:03.387 --> 05:05.389
Well yeah, I...

05:05.389 --> 05:08.392
Whoa, alright this is great, it'll be like
completely spontaneous, like I just...

05:08.392 --> 05:11.562
Why are you talking?
- I'm sorry, I...

05:16.358 --> 05:23.240
So it turns out that going away sex
is even hotter than make up sex.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.369
It's like these chips, they say now
even crunchier, and you're thinking,

05:27.369 --> 05:30.914
oh man there is no way,
but then you take a bite

05:32.624 --> 05:35.335
and it is crunchier.

05:35.377 --> 05:39.923
Dude if something's crunchy,
you should really have that looked at.

05:41.383 --> 05:46.388
There's no time my friend, I have
a distraught neighbour girl to attend to.

05:46.388 --> 05:50.350
Dry your eyes baby,
the lovin's on its way!

05:55.355 --> 06:00.277
Toe ring.
- Oh, Fez you like?

06:00.360 --> 06:05.782
Yeah, got a toe ring.
- On the little piggy that went to the market.

06:07.367 --> 06:13.290
<i>Steven what do you think?
- Can't resist toe ring.</i>

06:14.374 --> 06:17.711
Whatever.

06:18.378 --> 06:22.382
I have all sorts of things now that
I didn't have when we were going out.

06:22.382 --> 06:28.305
Toe ring, tan lines, a tattoo.
- You don't have a tattoo, you're bluffing.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.308
Do you have a tattoo?

06:31.391 --> 06:35.270
Well we're not going out,
so I guess you'll never know.

06:35.354 --> 06:41.235
I think I'm gonna stop wearing
them all together. See ya.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.363
Look at you watching her,
you love her, man.

06:44.363 --> 06:48.742
"Oh, baby, I love you so much."

06:54.373 --> 06:59.169
Were you doing Jackie?
- Yes, yes.

07:04.383 --> 07:09.388
Why am I even thinking about her?
Man, she's like Tahiti.

07:09.388 --> 07:13.308
It's warm and it's beautiful and you wanna go there,
but when you do you get bit by a mosquito

07:13.392 --> 07:17.271
and you get malaria and you're
sick for the rest of your life.

07:17.354 --> 07:22.359
She's obviously not over you either. She's
practically putting on a show to get your attention.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.028
Just imagine it.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.661
I love to dance.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.711
Okay the doctor wins.

08:22.794 --> 08:26.298
Eric and I boxed up all the liquor.

08:26.381 --> 08:30.719
Man, look at all this,
it's like Dean Martin exploded.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.389
There were bottles in the liquor
cabinet, the dining room hutch,

08:34.389 --> 08:37.308
my Mom's nightstand.

08:37.392 --> 08:42.188
Oh no, no, that's for polishing furniture.
- Mom, there's lipstick on it.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.401
It's just your luck Forman.
You're about to turn eighteen

08:46.485 --> 08:50.280
and there's gonna be no
hooch left in the house to steal.

08:50.364 --> 08:54.868
I mean avoid.
Do homework next to.

08:54.952 --> 08:59.706
Pray near.
Come on!

09:01.375 --> 09:07.297
Yeah, it's gonna be pretty boring around here.
You know what you should do?  Go to college.

09:07.381 --> 09:11.385
Mom would it be too much to ask for
Dad to be grateful that I'm staying?

09:11.385 --> 09:14.388
Honey, we're all going
through hard times.

09:14.388 --> 09:18.892
You're giving up your future,
I'm giving up my Schnapps.

09:22.354 --> 09:26.400
Let's not compare our pain.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.867
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Donna was really upset about leaving,

09:34.950 --> 09:39.371
so I had to comfort her
in a bedular way.

09:39.371 --> 09:45.043
It turns out if I get her sad, she gives it
away like goldfish at a freakin' carnival.

09:45.377 --> 09:49.381
Eric, I think you may have found
a secret open sesame to sex.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.302
Make the lady cry.

09:53.385 --> 09:56.305
Perhaps I should try
that with my wife.

09:56.388 --> 09:59.892
"Laurie here's a dead cat,
now do me."

10:00.392 --> 10:04.271
A little history Fez, I think
Laurie has a lot of open sesames.

10:04.354 --> 10:09.776
Like, "Hi, Laurie".
That usually does it.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.948
Actually I only ever got as far as 'Hi'.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.702
Fez, I did it with your wife!

10:19.369 --> 10:22.414
God I have so much power
over Donna now, it's like

10:22.498 --> 10:26.293
I know how
Obi-Wan Kenobi feels.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.379
"These aren't the droidsyou're looking for."

10:29.379 --> 10:34.218
Man, I wish I could do it with
Donna in a land speeder on.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.553
That would be so awesome.

10:38.388 --> 10:43.310
Hey, Steven, check out
my new super sexy tattoo.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.564
Hard to keep your hands off, huh?

10:48.357 --> 10:51.276
Steven!

10:51.360 --> 10:55.113
Sorry, here's your tattoo back.

10:56.365 --> 11:00.285
I'll take that.
- Steven, why are you being so difficult?

11:00.369 --> 11:05.290
Jackie, no amount of tattoos or toe rings, are
gonna fix the fact that you have a lot to apologise for.

11:05.374 --> 11:09.294
You're the one who should apologise.
- Then I guess we're not getting back together.

11:09.378 --> 11:14.299
I  guess we're not. Oh, and by the way,
you don't deserve a real tattoo.

11:14.383 --> 11:19.847
But if I were to get one, I'd show it
to Fez before I'd ever show it to you.

11:21.390 --> 11:25.477
I hope she gets it on her hienie.

11:38.365 --> 11:42.536
Jackie, it really bugs me that you
and Hyde aren't back together,

11:43.370 --> 11:47.124
so as the man who used
to pleasure you endlessly,

11:48.375 --> 11:52.296
I feel it is my obligation
to step in and fix this,

11:52.379 --> 11:58.218
cause when I'm a cop I'm gonna have to
deal with domestic cases like this all the time.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.305
And the good news is,
he'll have guns.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.308
Yeah, this is gonna be a piece of cake.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.226
Y'know they should have put
me in charge of Vietnam,

12:06.310 --> 12:10.480
I would have had those
people making out in a week.

12:11.356 --> 12:16.570
Wow, Donna, that might be the last time

12:16.653 --> 12:21.074
you'll ever get to see Kelso make
an even bigger mess of a problem.

12:21.366 --> 12:25.579
Yeah I'm gonna miss that.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.207
And I'm gonna miss you.
- Well I'm not gonna miss you two

12:28.290 --> 12:33.086
slobbering all over each other like
fat girls in a house with free meat.

12:37.382 --> 12:41.220
And that might be the last time that
Jackie ever makes fun of us,

12:41.303 --> 12:45.307
fat girls, and meat.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.893
Yeah...

12:53.357 --> 12:57.194
What? - Nothing,
it just could be the last time

12:57.277 --> 13:00.280
that you and I stand
beside the Vista Cruiser.

13:00.364 --> 13:05.369
I just waxed her she's
all slippy slidy.

13:09.373 --> 13:14.294
Donna this might be the last time
I bring you your toothbrush.

13:14.378 --> 13:17.297
That's not my toothbrush.

13:17.381 --> 13:22.469
Might be the last time...
I bring you the wrong toothbrush.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.271
Hello, darling.

13:32.354 --> 13:36.108
I see you are washing
your unmentionables.

13:36.358 --> 13:40.112
Yeah, do you know what gets
out grass stains and Kailua?

13:40.362 --> 13:42.281
Anyways...

13:42.364 --> 13:46.326
I was thinking how sad you must be
considering the mess you made of your life.

13:46.368 --> 13:51.373
With all that sadness,
do you not also get needy?

13:52.374 --> 13:56.670
Y'know, I sorta do.
- Ali Baba, the treasure is mine!

13:57.379 --> 14:01.550
I'm gonna go see
if Carlos is home.

14:02.384 --> 14:06.680
That Carlos is one lucky SOB
to have a wife like mine.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.314
Look, Hyde, I know you don't
wanna tell Jackie that you're sorry,

14:15.355 --> 14:19.276
but there's gotta some things that
you did, that you wish you hadn't done.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.280
Like that time that you told me to eat that
stuff, and I didn't know what it was,

14:23.363 --> 14:26.283
and then you licked your lips,
and you rubbed you stomach

14:26.366 --> 14:30.287
and you were like
'Mmm it's really good Kelso'

14:30.370 --> 14:35.417
and then I ate it and then
I wished I hadn't of done that.

14:38.378 --> 14:43.300
Yeah, well, maybe with Jackie I was
sort of impetuous and maybe a little rash.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.303
Now see, that's something
that Jackie oughta know.

14:46.386 --> 14:51.308
Hyde say's that he was sort of
infectious and he has a rash.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.562
What?
- I'm just telling you what he said.

14:56.355 --> 15:00.275
All right, look, Michael, Steven's the one
who messed up the relationship.

15:00.359 --> 15:02.361
He thought you and I were together
but he was just wrong.

15:02.361 --> 15:08.200
He fabricated the whole mess.
- Well somebody ought to make that clear.

15:08.367 --> 15:13.372
Jackie wants you to know that there was a
mess 'cause she was wearing the wrong fabric.

15:16.375 --> 15:20.504
That can't be what she said.
- It's word for word, man.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.298
Kelso, would you get outta here?
- What, I'm helping.

15:23.382 --> 15:26.301
You're making me wanna
kick your ass.

15:26.385 --> 15:29.680
That better be the rash talking.

15:46.363 --> 15:51.285
Busted, mister.
- You're like a damn cat.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.705
I'm gonna make you wear a bell.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.292
Bad health in a can,
that's what that is.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.295
The doctor said he wants nothing like
that around here, and I agree.

16:01.378 --> 16:05.382
All it takes is a little bit
of will power, Red.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.718
Even though you used to do
something without thinking,

16:07.801 --> 16:11.972
you just have to grab a hold
of those thoughts.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.562
Can I get you a refill there?

16:26.361 --> 16:29.281
Well there's a lesson for you.

16:29.364 --> 16:32.242
You're welcome.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.707
Oh hey, listen, son.

16:40.375 --> 16:46.423
It means a lot to your mother, you
staying here and helping out the family.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.385
And as for me I...

16:55.390 --> 17:01.855
There. Doctor said I should
write down my feelings.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.319
Are you actually thanking me?

17:10.364 --> 17:12.907
This is a list of yard work.

17:15.368 --> 17:19.957
Yeah, the lawn thanks you for all
that mowing you're gonna do.

17:20.374 --> 17:24.294
You're welcome, Dad.
- Yeah, well.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.214
All right, we're both men here.

17:32.386 --> 17:35.305
Oh, God.
- What's wrong?

17:35.389 --> 17:39.560
Nothing it's just this could
be the last time that...

17:42.354 --> 17:47.192
you and I watch Gilligan get hit
on the head by the Skipper.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.279
Eric, the more we talk about me
going away, the sadder you get.

17:50.362 --> 17:53.282
And being with you so much
lately has been great, but

17:53.365 --> 17:58.787
afterwards… well you always used
to look a little bit ashamed

17:59.371 --> 18:02.291
and I mean now you
just seem depressed.

18:02.374 --> 18:08.172
Oh no, no, I'm not depressed,
Donna, you are depressed.

18:14.386 --> 18:17.306
Okay, let's do this.

18:17.389 --> 18:22.227
All this last time stuff, have you
been saying that just for sex?

18:22.394 --> 18:25.731
What?  Have I... what?

18:31.361 --> 18:34.865
This is not the one
you're angry with.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.704
You're disgusting.

18:42.372 --> 18:46.543
That might be the last time we fight over
you trying to get me to have sex with you.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.301
Y'know Fez, this whole thing with
Hyde and Jackie is stupid.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.386
They both wanna be together,
and they would in a second

18:56.470 --> 18:59.806
f they just thought that other
one had said I'm sorry.

18:59.890 --> 19:03.310
Eureka, Fez, Eureka!

19:03.393 --> 19:06.605
I'm one step ahead of you my friend.
- Yeah I'll just lie to both of them,

19:06.647 --> 19:12.110
and tell them the other one said I'm sorry.
- I thought we were going to pan for gold.

19:16.365 --> 19:20.536
Okay, here we go,
let's make up.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.372
All right, look, Steven,
I heard what you said.

19:23.372 --> 19:27.209
Yeah, I heard what... wait a minute,
you heard what I said?

19:27.376 --> 19:31.296
Yeah, Michael told me,
and just so you know I'm sorry too.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.298
Too?

19:33.382 --> 19:38.178
No, you're not sorry too,
you're sorry one, I'm sorry too.

19:38.387 --> 19:42.015
Wait, what, no Michael said that...
- Yeah, he said that...

19:44.393 --> 19:48.146
I did my work, you two gotta
clean this mess up yourselves.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.275
So nothing's changed then?
- Guess no.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.277
Forget this.
- Okay, enough.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.280
Look, you guys, who
cares who apologised first?

19:56.363 --> 20:00.117
Jackie obviously wants to be with you,
and you're here which means

20:00.159 --> 20:02.286
that you wanna be with
her and I don't blame you,

20:02.369 --> 20:05.706
cause with that rash you ain't
got a whole lotta choices.

20:07.374 --> 20:11.461
All right, look, Steven,
do you wanna be with me?

20:12.379 --> 20:17.301
No, no a shrug's not gonna cut it.
Steven, I need you to say something.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.387
All right, look, I'll even go first.

20:20.470 --> 20:25.225
Steven I wanna be with you.
And you...

20:25.392 --> 20:27.311
I...

20:27.394 --> 20:30.230
Can you hang on a second?

20:30.355 --> 20:33.192
Would you get outta here?

20:33.358 --> 20:37.905
If you want me to leave, all you have
to do is say please. - Fine, please.

20:38.363 --> 20:41.700
That's better.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.288
Jackie, I do wanna be with you.

20:46.371 --> 20:51.251
Because you love...
- Don't push it.

20:58.383 --> 21:03.180
Okay, Steven, where's your beer?
- What? Me, beer?

21:03.388 --> 21:06.391
Kitty threw away all my beer,
the Packers are down by 11,

21:06.391 --> 21:11.271
you're 18, I know you have beer,
so where's your beer?

21:13.357 --> 21:15.275
I don't want used beer.

21:15.359 --> 21:18.779
Well, I might have a couple
of fresh ones in the shower.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.452
Yeah, I'm running low,
I should probably hit the store.
