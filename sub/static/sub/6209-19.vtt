WEBVTT

00:07.732 --> 00:08.961
Halt.

00:09.172 --> 00:11.243
You're stuffing my salmon
into your book bag.

00:11.411 --> 00:14.564
That red, flaky sockeye
is all I have to live for.

00:14.732 --> 00:15.882
Sorry, Salem.

00:16.052 --> 00:18.692
The clubs at school are collecting
canned goods for the food drive.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.889
You know, Sabrina,
charity begins at home.

00:21.052 --> 00:23.806
In fact, in my mind,
it begins in the cat dish.

00:24.732 --> 00:26.007
A whole fish.

00:26.172 --> 00:28.767
Oh! You're a good witch, Sabrina.

00:28.932 --> 00:31.208
And if there were another cat
in the house, I'd share it.

00:31.372 --> 00:33.091
Well, there's always
Fluffy next door.

00:33.893 --> 00:35.486
Yeah, yeah, I'll get right on that.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.052 --> 00:58.444
Please remove your shoes
and enjoy our show.

01:01.733 --> 01:02.883
SABRINA:
Aunt Hilda?

01:03.053 --> 01:05.807
You gonna drive me to school?
I'm fading fast down here.

01:05.973 --> 01:07.566
HILDA:
I just have to get my violin.

01:07.733 --> 01:10.373
Zelda, watch where you're going.
You just bumped right into me.

01:10.532 --> 01:11.967
ZELDA:
You bumped into me.

01:12.133 --> 01:13.487
I am so nervous.

01:13.653 --> 01:15.690
I have an audition for a string trio,

01:15.853 --> 01:17.731
and these musicians
are very serious.

01:17.893 --> 01:20.169
They think Mozart's <i>Requiem</i>
is too lighthearted.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.131
- Aunt Hilda?
- Just help me find my keys.

01:22.293 --> 01:23.613
Aunt Hilda, you have three arms.

01:24.093 --> 01:25.732
Don't I wish.

01:25.973 --> 01:29.854
What? Oh!
How did that get there?

01:30.013 --> 01:32.290
I don't know,
but it doesn't match your outfit.

01:32.773 --> 01:36.164
- Zelda.
- I know. I know.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.449
Aunt Zelda, you only have--

01:37.613 --> 01:40.128
I know. I still have two eyes.

01:40.653 --> 01:42.167
I have an audition in half an hour.

01:42.334 --> 01:45.008
I cannot show up at the conservatory
with three arms.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.813
That's cheating.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.125
<i>We've got a weather advisory
for anyone travelling</i>

01:49.294 --> 01:51.250
<i>from Neptune to Earth
this weekend.</i>

01:51.413 --> 01:52.973
- What's this?
- The Witch Channel.

01:53.134 --> 01:55.330
It's a rip-off at 19.95 a month.

01:55.494 --> 01:59.454
<i>Sunspots will be affecting the entire
inner half of the solar system.</i>

01:59.614 --> 02:01.207
Just as I suspected.

02:01.374 --> 02:02.602
What? What did you suspect?

02:02.774 --> 02:04.811
Sunspots.
They cause molecular instability.

02:04.974 --> 02:07.091
That's how my arm
got attached to Hilda.

02:07.254 --> 02:09.814
Is this permanent? If it is,
we'll have to cancel the canoe trip.

02:09.973 --> 02:11.567
We have to fix this.

02:11.734 --> 02:15.444
The people at the conservatory
already think I'm a little ditzy.

02:15.614 --> 02:17.367
Wherever would they get that idea?

02:17.854 --> 02:19.925
Well, there was that time
Yo-Yo Ma was soloing

02:20.094 --> 02:23.371
and I screamed,
"Kick up the jams, Yo-Yo."

02:23.894 --> 02:26.489
There's a spell to put our arms back,
but I have to look it up.

02:26.654 --> 02:28.486
Sabrina, you'll have to
take the bus to school.

02:28.654 --> 02:30.293
Oh! But I'll be late.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.127
He always picks up other kids.

02:32.294 --> 02:34.571
I'm sorry,
but I can't do everything at once.

02:34.735 --> 02:37.125
Especially with only one arm.

02:37.654 --> 02:40.614
I don't think I can go to school
with molecular instability in the air.

02:40.775 --> 02:42.368
I mean,
what if one of my arms breaks off

02:42.535 --> 02:44.014
and gets attached to Harvey?

02:44.175 --> 02:45.688
I don't think I could remain calm.

02:45.854 --> 02:46.970
Because you're half mortal,

02:47.134 --> 02:48.808
we don't know how sunspots
will affect you.

02:48.975 --> 02:50.931
You'll just have to be extra careful.

02:51.614 --> 02:54.130
I'm drawing a blank. Now, what was
the upside to being a witch?

02:54.295 --> 02:55.490
Need a hand?

03:04.015 --> 03:05.846
Science Club has
the worst bin in school.

03:06.014 --> 03:07.653
I brought some liquorice.
Does that help?

03:08.295 --> 03:11.129
We're not really
can people at my house.

03:19.175 --> 03:20.325
How'd you do that?

03:20.495 --> 03:22.009
- Do what?
- Your hair.

03:24.935 --> 03:27.131
Oh, no. Gotta go.

03:31.055 --> 03:33.570
Okay, I'm gonna pass out.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.044
Oh, no.

03:37.215 --> 03:38.775
Molecular instability.

03:38.935 --> 03:41.370
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, Harvey.

03:41.536 --> 03:44.050
I'm not sure God ever meant ravioli
to be stuffed into a can,

03:44.215 --> 03:45.695
but I've got a whole bag of them.

03:45.855 --> 03:47.335
Oh, great, thanks.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.453
What's that? Hair?

03:49.616 --> 03:52.414
Yeah. Uh, fake-- Wig.

03:53.335 --> 03:56.931
If you need to put it back on,
I've got some duct tape in my locker.

03:57.455 --> 04:00.334
The cheerleaders have collected
more canned food than any other club.

04:01.175 --> 04:03.452
I just wish I could get
more excited about this.

04:03.616 --> 04:06.415
It's the idea of charity.
It just seems so un-American.

04:06.976 --> 04:09.332
Well, what if we made
the food drive a competition?

04:09.496 --> 04:10.816
Would that make it more American?

04:10.976 --> 04:15.971
Are you suggesting we pit one
service organisation against the other?

04:16.136 --> 04:18.524
A way of saying:
We're better than you are.

04:18.696 --> 04:21.575
I like the way you think.

04:21.735 --> 04:22.930
Competition?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.292
Mr. Kraft, this is a food drive,
not a contest.

04:27.215 --> 04:31.096
Sabrina, your wig-thing's
on the back of your jacket.

04:32.936 --> 04:35.007
We're not supposed to be
collecting food for a prize.

04:35.176 --> 04:37.213
We should do it out of
the goodness of our hearts.

04:37.376 --> 04:40.051
Oh, I'm sure that's how it's done,
in Red China.

04:41.256 --> 04:44.056
At any rate, thanks to a wonderful
suggestion from Libby,

04:44.217 --> 04:48.177
the club that collects the most food
will be awarded a lovely prize.

04:48.337 --> 04:51.534
And the rest of you
can just feel bad.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.208
Good luck, children.

04:56.537 --> 04:59.416
- Well, how'd the audition go?
- Fine.

05:00.016 --> 05:02.248
They wanna come over tomorrow
to talk some more.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.375
In other words,
spy on me to see if I'm nuts.

05:06.216 --> 05:09.846
Someone told them about the time
you tp'd Carnegie Hall.

05:10.417 --> 05:13.056
Don't worry. We'll both be charming

05:13.217 --> 05:15.048
and they will love you
for who you are.

05:15.537 --> 05:17.210
Like that's ever worked before.

05:18.816 --> 05:20.092
Oh!

05:20.257 --> 05:22.010
This is not good.

05:22.857 --> 05:24.849
Oh, no. Molecular instability again.

05:25.017 --> 05:27.771
- I'll get the magic book.
- And maybe a rope?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.211
VALERIE:
So, what are you gonna do to Libby?

05:31.377 --> 05:34.529
- Yell? Insult her in front of everyone?
- No, I'm just gonna talk to her nicely

05:34.697 --> 05:37.371
and explain to her that competition
is not in the spirit of charity.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.096
And then whack her with a can?

05:39.257 --> 05:40.657
Hold my hair.

05:41.177 --> 05:44.727
Good, I'm just late enough
to make a perfect entrance.

05:45.417 --> 05:47.136
[GRUNTS]

05:52.977 --> 05:54.013
Watch it, cheerleader.

05:54.177 --> 05:57.136
Oh, excuse me, Sabrina. I'm sorry.

06:00.097 --> 06:02.487
Hi, guys, how are you?

06:04.178 --> 06:06.487
What are you grinning at, Harpo?

06:08.818 --> 06:09.854
Fish sticks again?

06:10.018 --> 06:12.897
Couldn't there be an executive side
to this cafeteria?

06:13.978 --> 06:16.253
Oh, there's Valerie.
She's gonna sit with us.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.647
She always sits with us.

06:17.818 --> 06:19.649
She's so clingy.
Don't you think she's clingy?

06:19.818 --> 06:21.013
Are you okay, Sabrina?

06:21.178 --> 06:22.817
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:23.378 --> 06:25.370
What? What did I do wrong?

06:25.538 --> 06:26.688
Nothing.

06:26.858 --> 06:27.893
[MOUTHS]
<i>Clingy.</i>

06:29.778 --> 06:31.337
Hi, guys,
I'm gonna go get some dessert.

06:31.498 --> 06:33.455
Anybody want some? My treat.

06:33.618 --> 06:35.735
Sure, that's so nice of you, thanks.

06:37.738 --> 06:39.650
Oh, why don't you just marry her?

06:43.139 --> 06:45.369
Hey, Emma. Nice outfit.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.177
[LAUGHING]

06:47.338 --> 06:48.533
Oh, no.

06:48.698 --> 06:50.929
- Mom was wrong again.
- You guys.

06:51.418 --> 06:53.138
- You're hurting her feelings.
- What?

06:56.258 --> 06:57.931
Did you see what Emma's wearing?

06:58.098 --> 07:00.659
I mean, all that's missing
is a big red nose and yellow shoes.

07:01.178 --> 07:02.977
It doesn't matter what you wear.

07:03.139 --> 07:04.732
What matters is
what's in your heart.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.897
"What matters is
what's in your heart."

07:07.578 --> 07:09.696
Put it on a sampler.

07:10.099 --> 07:11.692
Wait, you wanna go to the mall?

07:11.858 --> 07:13.418
I guess.

07:15.859 --> 07:17.498
Hey, not so hard.

07:17.659 --> 07:20.299
You're petting a cat,
not polishing andirons.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.529
Excuse me?

07:21.698 --> 07:23.816
Boning up on your magic?

07:23.979 --> 07:27.859
Duh. I have all this power,
I never do anything with it.

07:28.219 --> 07:31.053
Maybe the captain of the football team
should grovel at my feet.

07:33.218 --> 07:35.893
Sabrina,
I can't quarterback without you.

07:36.059 --> 07:37.891
I'll get back to you.

07:38.059 --> 07:41.177
Hm. Focusing on
the self-serving spells?

07:41.339 --> 07:42.853
- Got a problem?
<i>- Moi?</i> No way.

07:43.019 --> 07:45.739
I tried to use my powers
to take over the world, remember?

07:45.899 --> 07:46.969
Hence the fur.

07:47.139 --> 07:50.132
- Put a sock in it. I'm trying to read.
- You're kidding, right?

07:50.659 --> 07:53.015
You're not kidding. I'm still talking.

07:53.179 --> 07:54.978
Sorry.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.897
Coming through.

08:42.659 --> 08:45.539
Sabrina, on behalf of the food drive,
I'm giving you this plaque for--

08:45.700 --> 08:47.976
- Excuse me.
- Oh, boy.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.576
Can I have everyone's attention?

08:49.741 --> 08:51.697
Mr. Kraft has an award to present.

08:51.860 --> 08:55.376
The Science Club collected
the most canned food,

08:55.901 --> 08:57.050
through some miracle,

08:57.220 --> 08:58.813
and the award goes to--

08:58.980 --> 09:00.016
Me.

09:00.180 --> 09:01.739
- Thank you, Mr. Kraft.
- Sure.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.132
I'd like to thank all the little people
who worked so hard to help me.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.893
But the truth is, I did it all by myself.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.018
So my deepest,
sincerest thanks to me.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.452
They didn't even put my name
on this stupid plaque.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.771
It just says Science Club.

09:14.941 --> 09:17.057
Like the Science Club would
even exist without me.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.052
I'm telling you,
if I was running this school--

09:19.221 --> 09:20.734
I wish you were running the school.

09:21.221 --> 09:23.337
You know, the way Libby used to--

09:23.821 --> 09:25.254
Help the blind?

09:25.420 --> 09:27.094
--before she changed.

09:27.261 --> 09:28.933
Yeah, everyone's always liked you,
Sabrina,

09:29.101 --> 09:30.454
but we were all afraid of Libby.

09:30.621 --> 09:32.101
Now everyone's afraid of you.

09:32.261 --> 09:34.173
- They are?
- Oh, yeah.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.661
You've got the power.

09:36.981 --> 09:39.780
I do, don't I?

09:52.422 --> 09:54.174
What are you looking at?

10:10.461 --> 10:12.851
I can use my power for anything.

10:13.021 --> 10:16.538
For the good of mankind
or for the good of me.

10:17.102 --> 10:21.301
Oh, Miss Spellman,
I believe it's time for class.

10:28.982 --> 10:31.338
Okay, folks, show's over.

10:42.022 --> 10:43.775
Hilda?

10:44.582 --> 10:46.221
What happened to you?

10:46.382 --> 10:48.453
I'm afraid a small black hole
just formed in the sink.

10:48.622 --> 10:50.056
More molecular instability?

10:50.222 --> 10:51.497
It just sucked the kitchen table

10:51.662 --> 10:53.654
and a whole platter of tea cakes
into oblivion.

10:53.822 --> 10:54.892
Well, what are we gonna do?

10:55.062 --> 10:56.655
Marie and Claude
will be here any minute.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.973
They're mortals.
They don't do black holes.

10:59.302 --> 11:00.338
What's going on?

11:00.502 --> 11:02.176
Oh, a small infinite chasm
in the sink.

11:02.342 --> 11:03.776
Nothing to worry about.

11:03.942 --> 11:05.502
Well, you guys
seem stressed today.

11:05.663 --> 11:07.096
Is there anything
I can help you with?

11:07.262 --> 11:10.175
No, no,
but how sweet of you to offer.

11:10.342 --> 11:12.937
Anything for two wonderful aunts.

11:15.182 --> 11:16.821
Suckers.

11:16.982 --> 11:19.782
Well, I'm glad to see molecular
instability hasn't affected her.

11:19.943 --> 11:20.979
But what about the trio?

11:21.143 --> 11:22.896
We'll have to keep them
out of the kitchen.

11:23.063 --> 11:24.702
Oh, and off the sofa
and out of the chair.

11:24.863 --> 11:26.819
Gee, this isn't gonna be
awkward at all.

11:27.623 --> 11:28.976
SALEM:
What's up?

11:29.142 --> 11:30.816
Looking for a spell
to take over my school.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.339
Really? You know, Sabrina,
I've noticed you've become

11:33.503 --> 11:36.735
so much more confident and assertive
these last few days.

11:36.903 --> 11:38.461
I can turn anyone into a goat.

11:38.623 --> 11:40.979
- Why wouldn't I be confident?
- Precisely.

11:41.143 --> 11:42.862
But since we're thinking
about takeovers,

11:43.023 --> 11:46.175
why waste your efforts
on some rinky-dink little high school?

11:46.343 --> 11:49.063
With your powers,
you could do so much more.

11:49.223 --> 11:50.418
How much more?

11:50.583 --> 11:53.815
