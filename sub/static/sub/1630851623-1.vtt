00:03.177 --> 00:04.221
<i>Previously on Legacies... I love you, Hope Mikaelson.</i>

00:04.265 --> 00:06.876
- Hope, what's happening?
- Landon?!

00:06.919 --> 00:09.052
<i>I knew you were alive.
I could just feel it. </i>

00:09.096 --> 00:10.358
Long time no see.

00:10.401 --> 00:11.707
Who or what are you?

00:11.750 --> 00:13.056
I'm not who you think I am.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.666
<i>I went through hell
to find you. </i>

00:14.710 --> 00:16.059
<i>
I am the son of Malivore.</i>

00:16.103 --> 00:17.495
We exist to destroy each other.

00:17.539 --> 00:18.714
Are you breaking up with me?

00:18.757 --> 00:20.063
Goodbye, Hope.

00:20.107 --> 00:20.890
<i>
My dad built this school</i>

00:20.933 --> 00:22.022
for people like us.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.024
<i>Come with me.</i>

00:25.547 --> 00:27.505
<i>
That's what this vision quest
was about. </i>

00:27.549 --> 00:29.507
<i>The way we
can finally defeat Malivore. </i>

00:29.551 --> 00:32.249
I have to become the Tribrid.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.424
<i>
Where you headed?</i>

00:33.468 --> 00:35.209
To find another way
to kill Malivore.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.166
Need a hand?

00:36.210 --> 00:37.863
Landon?

00:39.126 --> 00:41.041
What are you doing to him?

00:41.084 --> 00:43.391
<i>
That is not Landon, Hope.</i>

00:43.434 --> 00:44.870
<i>
We want our friends back.</i>

00:46.437 --> 00:48.091
Fate's a bitch, isn't it?

01:01.235 --> 01:03.063
- My friend!
- Ah...

01:03.106 --> 01:06.109
How is this possible?

01:06.153 --> 01:08.981
How is any of this possible?

01:39.011 --> 01:42.537
This world can be whatever
you want it to be, Cleo.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.763
Malivore.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.939
Don't look at me that way.

01:53.983 --> 01:57.160
Your eternity can be one
of endless peace...

01:57.204 --> 01:58.944
or misery.

01:58.988 --> 02:01.773
Your paradise
or your hell.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.514
It's your choice.

02:03.558 --> 02:06.256
I would choose peace, but I
imagine it comes at a cost.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.171
Just one favor.

02:08.215 --> 02:12.349
A single, inspired solution for
this little problem that I have.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.178
What is the problem?

02:33.675 --> 02:35.807
Hello, Clarice.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.069
God.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.810
Sorry.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.638
Unexpected side effect
of taking over Landon's body

02:40.682 --> 02:42.336
is I now have all his memories.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.207
Do you know
how many movies

02:44.251 --> 02:45.382
this kid has seen?

02:45.426 --> 02:46.992
At least he gives us
a shorthand.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.820
I'd like to get this over with
as soon as possible.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.170
Oh, come on.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.519
You have to be
a little impressed

02:51.562 --> 02:53.216
with how I tricked Landon
out of the darkness.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.522
All it cost me was The
Necromancer's freedom.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.393
Which it sounds like
he screwed up again.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.221
Actually,
Ted did something noble.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.657
Which I'm not even gonna try
explaining to you.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.877
But I will explain this.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.054
You're not
Hannibal Lecter.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.752
You're the lamb.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.667
You won't kill me.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.061
You'd be killing him.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.237
For all its
human fragility,

03:14.281 --> 03:16.674
this vessel is
perfect in that way.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.851
Well... I mean,
it's not that perfect.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.375
You're gonna
give me proof

03:21.418 --> 03:22.506
whether or not Landon's
still in there,

03:22.550 --> 03:24.856
and you-- whatever--

03:24.900 --> 03:26.380
because, you know, if not...

03:29.078 --> 03:31.123
Look, I share your frustrations.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.082
I want to kill you, too.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.867
But doing that would only make
you a fully activated Tribrid.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.695
- We're at an impasse.
- You're right.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.220
I'm not gonna kill you until
I know that Landon's alive.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.526
But I have no problem hurting
you until I know that he is.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.572
In ways that
he'll heal from

03:44.615 --> 03:45.921
and thankfully
won't remember

03:45.964 --> 03:48.271
until I bring him back.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.361
Does your headmaster know
you're planning on torturing me?

03:51.405 --> 03:54.146
- Do your friends?
- Need-to-know basis.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.453
But don't worry, I'm sure
that they'll come for you.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.325
You know, once they hear you
start screaming.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.421
I'm guessing you
didn't cast that spell.

04:09.597 --> 04:12.904
I'm also guessing
that's not to keep me in here,

04:12.948 --> 04:15.342
but to keep you out.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.912
Dr. Saltzman, what the hell?

04:20.956 --> 04:22.827
Well, this is awkward.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.481
Nobody told me
that there was gonna be

04:24.525 --> 04:25.917
a Super Squad meeting
this morning.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.484
Just like
nobody told me

04:27.528 --> 04:29.312
about the barrier spell
that was put up in the gym.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.314
That's because this is
an emergency session

04:31.358 --> 04:33.273
about how we're gonna deal
with Malivore.

04:33.316 --> 04:36.101
And how you fit
into that plan.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.625
Then I'm all ears. Plan away.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.018
Not my plan.

04:41.324 --> 04:44.284
Cleo's the key to all of this,

04:44.327 --> 04:45.676
our problem being
that Landon--

04:45.720 --> 04:47.635
Mali... Malivore...

04:47.678 --> 04:49.289
Malidon?--

04:49.332 --> 04:51.116
has consumed her.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.335
Which means we
have to assume

04:52.379 --> 04:54.206
that she's in the
belly of the beast,

04:54.250 --> 04:55.425
in the pocket
dimension

04:55.469 --> 04:58.428
inside of Mali... whatever.

04:58.472 --> 05:01.213
Yeah, I've been there twice, so
you can skip to the actual plan.

05:01.257 --> 05:05.653
If we can find Cleo,
she may be able to inspire us

05:05.696 --> 05:08.220
with a way to get her out.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.353
And what about Landon?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.529
Took longer than I expected,
but there it is.

05:12.573 --> 05:13.704
Does someone else

05:13.748 --> 05:15.532
want to tell her, or should I?

05:15.576 --> 05:16.490
Cleo's the target

05:16.533 --> 05:18.013
of this mission.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.537
Though we're
obviously hoping

05:20.581 --> 05:23.366
she'll inspire a way
- to save Landon, too.
- Okay,

05:23.410 --> 05:26.804
and how do we get inside
Malivore, besides him eating us?

05:26.848 --> 05:28.806
Malivore thinks that being
inside of Landon's body

05:28.850 --> 05:31.374
is protecting him,
but the way I see it,

05:31.418 --> 05:35.160
that's his greatest weakness,
which Kaleb and I can exploit

05:35.204 --> 05:36.727
with our vampire
strength.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.903
Hmm. The exhaust port
on the Death Star.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.209
- Exactly.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.168
Sorry.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.692
It's a good plan.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.694
Why didn't you guys
tell me sooner?

05:46.737 --> 05:49.479
'Cause of the way you
are with things when
it comes to Landon.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.915
Don't get us wrong,
you're our best weapon,

05:50.959 --> 05:52.656
no doubt, but we get
one shot at this, Hope.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.354
We can't have you
going off the rails

05:54.397 --> 05:56.268
and blowing everything up.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.531
I wouldn't do that.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.883
Is that seriously
what you guys think?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.279
We know you, Hope,

06:07.323 --> 06:08.846
it's why we put up
the barrier spell

06:08.890 --> 06:09.891
in the first place.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.416
We thought maybe
you should sit this one out.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.505
I'm totally on board.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.942
Cleo is our best chance to bring

06:17.986 --> 06:21.598
both her and Landon back--
I would never jeopardize that.

06:21.642 --> 06:24.427
I'm really sorry that
you guys think that I would.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.603
But I can help.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.563
I will help,
so please, just let me.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.089
I say we put it to a vote.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.049
<i>
How could you?!</i>

06:38.093 --> 06:39.399
There is no way
I'm letting you

06:39.442 --> 06:40.443
go through with this plan
without me.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.531
Hope, stop!
You're hurting me.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.228
Well, then I guess
we're even.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.535
Because you always voting
against me hurts me, too.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.103
Now, siphon that damn barrier
so we can do this my way.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.591
What's this I hear
about a plan?

07:03.335 --> 07:06.469
<i>The Mystical Anatomy
of the Human Mind? </i>

07:06.513 --> 07:08.471
Hey, yeah, it's, um...

07:08.515 --> 07:10.821
for a group project.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.650
Which you clearly don't want
to tell me about.

07:13.694 --> 07:16.653
Is that your thing?
'Cause it happens a lot.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.134
I know. But it won't be forever.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.092
There's just a lot
going on right now.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.616
I'm gonna make it up to you.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.488
Then you can start
with our bowling date tonight.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.098
What's taking you so long?

07:27.142 --> 07:30.145
Have you canceled
your date... yet?

07:30.188 --> 07:31.320
Sorry.

07:31.363 --> 07:32.495
Clearly a work
in progress.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.497
So, thanks in advance

07:34.541 --> 07:36.281
- for understanding.
- Pretty hard

07:36.325 --> 07:37.674
to understand something
you know nothing about.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.588
Trust me,

07:38.632 --> 07:40.155
the less you know, the better.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.765
Aren't you both being
a wee bit dramatic?

07:41.809 --> 07:42.940
It's not a big deal.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.638
I had to cancel with Ethan, too.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.378
Except our date isn't canceled.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.684
It's just rescheduled.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.947
Once we finish this project.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.514
Which will be soon.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.124
- I hope.
- Just let me know, Jo.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.691
That's all I'm asking.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.957
<i>
This isn't gonna end well.</i>

08:00.001 --> 08:01.176
A head dive?

08:01.219 --> 08:02.830
Seriously?

08:02.873 --> 08:04.658
But, hey, if you
want to go charging

08:04.701 --> 08:06.355
into a mental
trap, be my guest.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.531
All right, Kaleb,
you're up.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.707
I still think you
should let me go with you.

08:10.751 --> 08:11.969
You don't know

08:12.013 --> 08:13.144
what you're gonna run into
in there.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.668
I do.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.365
It's ugly.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.716
You really think you're
just gonna stroll

08:19.760 --> 08:21.718
into my mind
and rescue your students?

08:23.024 --> 08:24.982
That's optimistic.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.332
I'll have access
to your mind, too.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.334
Yeah, I figured
this wouldn't be easy.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.422
And that's why you both

08:30.466 --> 08:31.423
will be watching Kaleb and I

08:31.467 --> 08:32.424
while we're incapacitated.

08:32.468 --> 08:33.730
If you see any signs

08:33.774 --> 08:37.560
of trauma, or if Goth
Landon wakes up...

08:37.604 --> 08:39.693
- pull me out.
- By the time

08:39.736 --> 08:41.172
they see anything,
it'll be too late.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.565
Dad.

08:42.609 --> 08:43.914
Maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.177
Actually,
it's not bad.

08:46.221 --> 08:49.093
I just wouldn't
call it inspired,

08:49.137 --> 08:51.182
though, because you've made
one grave mistake:

08:51.226 --> 08:53.054
I'm aware of what you're doing.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.536
So you won't be entering
my subconscious mind.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.755
You'll be dealing
with my conscious mind...

08:59.713 --> 09:01.758
...which cannot wait
to torture yours.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.107
Okay.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.021
We should call this off.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.719
Like hell.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.590
But you definitely
need a wingman, Doc.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.591
No.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.288
We stick to the plan.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.271
This is gonna be fun.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.797
All right.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.713
The coast is clear.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.759
<i>Invisique saeclum.</i>

09:45.802 --> 09:47.630
Do you think
he bought it?

09:47.674 --> 09:49.240
I guess we'll find out.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.286
Get us in there.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.650
You were right-- this
is super unsettling.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.957
Can't say it gets easier,
but the fact

10:10.000 --> 10:11.306
that we're in the darkness

10:11.349 --> 10:12.655
and not being attacked
by monsters

10:12.699 --> 10:14.788
means that
your plan worked.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.746
Dr. Saltzman and Kaleb
must be keeping

10:16.790 --> 10:19.836
Malivore's conscious mind
distracted.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.490
So...

10:23.492 --> 10:25.015
...which way do we go?

10:25.059 --> 10:26.843
We could vote on it,
but you know our headmaster's

10:26.887 --> 10:28.584
not here to break the tie
this time.

10:29.585 --> 10:30.717
All right.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.850
Let the record show

10:33.894 --> 10:37.288
that I voted for you,
too, and you won.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.682
Have some trust
in the democratic process, Hope.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.684
It still feels like
I lost the popular vote.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.121
I mean, the only reason
why anyone trusts me to be here

10:44.165 --> 10:46.471
is because you're
keeping an eye on me.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.996
I mean, can you blame them?

10:49.039 --> 10:50.867
You do have this...

10:50.911 --> 10:55.872
habit of prioritizing Landon
at all costs.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.700
I already said
I was sorry.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.485
I mean, what more do you want me
to do to prove it to you?

11:00.529 --> 11:02.705
If I had to guess,
I'd say find Cleo.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.142
If that is what you want,
all you have to do

11:05.186 --> 11:07.231
is stick to the plan.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.711
Okay.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.844
In that case,
your plan, your call.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.672
Pick a
direction.

11:17.764 --> 11:21.332
I guess I chose right.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.726
Or wrong.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.163
Could be a trap. It's a
classic Malivore move.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.775
Either way,
I'll back you up.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.426
Kaleb.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.646
What the hell
are you doing here?
Me?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.083
Why the hell are you mopping?

12:16.126 --> 12:17.780
Not important.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.956
I specifically asked you
- not to come.
- Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.957
Like I said, you clearly

12:21.001 --> 12:23.264
could use a wingman.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.619
Oh, man.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.451
This is my high school.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.800
<i>Was</i> your
high school.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.802
Past tense.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.413
We're in some sort of
merged consciousness

12:42.457 --> 12:45.765
- within his dimension.
- Doc, I don't speak Malivore.

12:45.808 --> 12:46.635
Where-where are the...
where are the monsters

12:46.678 --> 12:47.810
and-and the darkness?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.594
He said he has access
to our minds.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.901
He obviously does,

12:51.945 --> 12:53.120
because this
is a memory

12:53.163 --> 12:54.730
you and I share.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.777
The day we met.

13:05.175 --> 13:09.092
You know what <i>
won't</i> help them?

13:09.136 --> 13:10.833
Hovering.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.966
Our job is to do nothing
unless there's a problem.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.925
So maybe you should load up
on magic, like me,

13:15.969 --> 13:18.841
- and try to stay calm.
- Can you stop telling me
how I should feel?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
Okay.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.933
You're clearly mad at me.
So what's up?

13:23.977 --> 13:26.849
I didn't like the way that
you treated Finch earlier.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.460
Sometimes you can be
really dismissive
about my relationships.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.288
So what? It's not like
you and Finch are serious

13:31.332 --> 13:32.463
or anything.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.031
Well... not yet.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.163
Hey.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.729
What are you doing here?

13:37.773 --> 13:39.993
Jed said you'd be in here,
and I thought,

13:40.036 --> 13:42.996
if you can't come to the date,
the date can come to you.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.477
Plus, I found this
ridiculous compatibility
quiz the three of us

13:46.521 --> 13:48.392
can take to get to know
each other better.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.700
You know, in case
we ever get serious.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.879
There's got to be
some way out of here.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.055
Damn, homecoming.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.666
I remember this night
like it was yesterday.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.060
You know I caught the
winning touchdown that night?

14:04.104 --> 14:06.671
I'd probably be
going pro right now.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.412
If you hadn't found me.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.893
I think football would have been
the least of your problems.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.764
What's that supposed to mean?

14:13.940 --> 14:15.506
'Cause I fed on somebody
afterwards?

14:15.550 --> 14:17.334
Let's not forget the part
where you almost killed me.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.771
Which is a legit response
to a vampire hunter showing up

14:19.815 --> 14:21.512
in your locker room
with a crossbow.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.210
Which you knocked out
of my hands.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.994
And then you pumped me up
with vervain

14:25.038 --> 14:26.517
and dragged my ass
to the Salvatore School.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.345
Memory over.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.999
The point is, you didn't trust
that I could handle it--

14:30.043 --> 14:32.088
kind of like coming
with you today.

14:32.132 --> 14:35.091
I have only ever tried
to look after you, Kaleb.

14:38.747 --> 14:41.228
Yeah, we're not going in there.

14:41.271 --> 14:44.057
That's exactly what
he wants us to do.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.754
But then we're not gonna find
another way out.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.190
Doc, this night sucked.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.584
Okay? But I keep telling you,
we're a team now.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.249
Took you guys long enough.

15:03.293 --> 15:06.470
Get lost in your own memory?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.298
What do you want?

15:08.342 --> 15:10.953
Just for our star wide-out
to know the full story.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.912
You see, I've seen
into both your minds,

15:12.955 --> 15:15.218
and there's a funny thing
about this particular memory

15:15.262 --> 15:16.785
that you two share.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.659
They don't exactly match up.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.183
Yeah?

16:13.363 --> 16:15.496
Cleo?

16:25.854 --> 16:27.899
I invited them to dinner.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.859
Oh, yeah.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.165
That's...

16:32.208 --> 16:33.818
exactly why we came here.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.038
Right, Hope?

16:37.083 --> 16:40.608
Well, if this is a trap,
at least it smells good.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.052
- So, Cleo, how are you?
- Perfect.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.880
Thank you for asking.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.403
You know, I have a lot
that I want to ask you.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.491
Do you need any help

16:54.535 --> 16:56.015
with that, um, art project?

16:56.058 --> 16:57.146
I just know that
when I need help,

16:57.190 --> 17:00.149
I-I like to go
to my friends, so...

17:00.193 --> 17:02.412
Hmm, that is wise,
but as I said,

17:02.456 --> 17:03.370
I am good.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.372
Ooh. I'm happy

17:05.415 --> 17:07.243
you're adjusting so well.

17:07.287 --> 17:10.029
It's just that, mm, some of
our other friends might not be.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.682
Which, speaking of,
have you seen Landon recently?

17:11.726 --> 17:14.076
I heard that he moved
to this neighborhood, so...

17:14.120 --> 17:16.078
Uh, hey, I think
we came here

17:16.122 --> 17:17.340
to visit Cleo.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.255
Remember?

17:19.299 --> 17:20.691
Then perhaps that was a mistake.

17:20.735 --> 17:21.518
This is not
a good time.

17:21.562 --> 17:22.606
Please go.

17:22.650 --> 17:23.912
We just got here.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.089
To hell with this plan!
There's no reason

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
to talk in riddles
or pass around fake food,

17:29.135 --> 17:30.049
because none of this is real.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.233
You should have left
when you had the chance.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.365
<i>
Hey, say what you want,</i>

17:42.409 --> 17:43.453
we were there.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.716
Then you won't mind a replay.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.937
Let's review
some game-night footage.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.548
It was neck and neck.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.290
The ball's placed
just shy of midfield.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.900
He's going deep.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.728
He's breaking free.
He caught it!

17:57.772 --> 17:59.121
He's at the 20, the ten...

17:59.165 --> 18:00.731
Touchdown!

18:00.775 --> 18:02.211
All-all right.
Enough with the "previously on."

18:02.255 --> 18:05.258
I destroyed the Danville
Bucks, and then I fed.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.911
It's not news.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.913
Flag on the play. You did feed.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.133
But it was just the appetizer.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.798
No.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.801
You're lying. I never did that.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.151
Let's check
behind door number two.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.291
It's all
coming back now.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.945
How it felt that night.

18:40.989 --> 18:44.949
So traumatic that
your mind repressed it.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.169
That uncontrollable bloodlust.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.432
Now, for fun,
let's crank it up a notch.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.478
<i>Make you feel it all over again.</i>

18:53.393 --> 18:55.003
No!
Kaleb,
it's time to abort.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.614
- Pull us out now.
- I can't!

19:01.227 --> 19:03.185
It's his mind--
he's got a hold on me!

19:03.229 --> 19:07.015
You looking
for that vervain?

19:07.058 --> 19:09.496
Slight rewrite. The real Landon
would say the remake

19:09.539 --> 19:10.801
is never better
than the original,

19:10.845 --> 19:12.629
but, I mean, I got to disagree.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.461
I'm guessing this isn't part
of your rewrite.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.071
I hate to leave,

19:20.115 --> 19:21.856
but I'm pretty sure
I know how this ends.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.206
Oh, one more thing I should have
mentioned back in the cage,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.077
but if you die
within my consciousness,

19:26.121 --> 19:28.167
it will severely damage
your mind in the real world.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.342
Good luck.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.605
He seems hungry.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.391
<i>
"Would you rather...</i>

19:35.435 --> 19:37.480
"have a vacation home
in the mountains

19:37.524 --> 19:40.004
or on the beach?"

19:40.048 --> 19:41.354
- Both.
- Both.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.269
Jinx!
Jinx!

19:46.054 --> 19:47.229
What?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.188
We can't help it
that we're compatible.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.538
Yet you've only known each other
for, like, three weeks.

19:51.581 --> 19:52.843
Anyway,
mine's beach.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.410
Not that you asked.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.196
Okay, let's go
to another section. Oh.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.850
The Five Qs of Love.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.112
Number one.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.114
Have you ever had
a relationship

20:03.158 --> 20:06.857
that you were absolutely certain
was meant to be,

20:06.901 --> 20:08.511
but it all turned out
to be a mirage

20:08.555 --> 20:11.862
and broke your heart
because life is cruel?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.864
You made that up.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.692
And you don't need
to answer that.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.216
No, it's okay.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.260
Of course I have.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.348
People are

20:19.392 --> 20:22.351
constantly growing and changing.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.266
You can't control it.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.789
But...

20:25.833 --> 20:27.269
you just have to hope
you're growing

20:27.313 --> 20:29.053
in the same direction,

20:29.097 --> 20:30.272
I guess.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.231
I was just about
to say that, too.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.018
My turn.

20:39.847 --> 20:42.066
Oh, this is
an easy one.

20:42.110 --> 20:45.331
"Where do you see yourself
on your 25th birthday?"

20:51.337 --> 20:53.861
Did I say something wrong?

21:00.476 --> 21:01.651
Oh, crap.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.440
Nice try.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.486
I'll be right back.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.532
I've got a secret mission
to crash.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.100
<i>
Leave me now. You have done</i>

21:16.144 --> 21:17.667
- quite enough.
- We're not going
anywhere.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.321
Hope,

21:19.365 --> 21:21.280
- this isn't in the playbook.
- Sorry, but I've had

21:21.323 --> 21:23.456
enough make-believe to fill up
this entire crappy black hole.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.761
I know what it's like

21:24.805 --> 21:25.980
to want to hold on
to what you love

21:26.023 --> 21:27.198
even after it's gone.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.330
I did it over
and over again,

21:28.374 --> 21:30.419
from one fake Landon
to the next.

21:30.463 --> 21:31.942
The lesson
that I learned is

21:31.986 --> 21:33.857
that the illusion never lasts.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.207
But what is real,
what does last,

21:36.251 --> 21:38.949
no matter how many times you've
screwed it up, are your friends.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.996
We came here
- to help you, Cleo.
- I am so used

21:42.039 --> 21:44.477
to having to fight for myself,
I did not believe

21:44.520 --> 21:46.696
anybody would come for me.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.350
You're Super Squad.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.352
We never leave a member behind.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.529
You once said that you
wanted us to be friends.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.009
I want that, too.

21:55.052 --> 21:57.359
I'm gonna stop at nothing
to bring you home,

21:57.403 --> 21:59.405
but we need your muse powers
to lead the way.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.453
I appreciate that more
than you can know, Hope, but...

22:04.497 --> 22:07.195
You're too late.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.720
Got to hand it to you,
it was a pretty good plan.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.680
Drawing the eye of Sauron
away from the muse,

22:13.723 --> 22:16.160
while the two of you slipped
into Mordor

22:16.204 --> 22:18.162
through the back door.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.164
Considering how many movies
this vessel has seen,

22:20.208 --> 22:22.166
I probably should have seen
this one coming.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.472
Well, then you should know
in those movies

22:23.516 --> 22:24.995
that the good guys always win.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.649
The good guys don't usually
blow the whole plan

22:26.693 --> 22:28.042
in the second act.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.565
The moment you broke up

22:29.609 --> 22:31.045
that dinner party, you
alerted my consciousness.

22:31.088 --> 22:34.527
Now, if you
don't mind--

22:34.570 --> 22:35.745
pun definitely intended--

22:35.789 --> 22:37.965
me and my muse got
to get back to it.

22:38.879 --> 22:41.229
And you both have
somewhere to be, too.

22:53.241 --> 22:54.547
MG?

22:55.548 --> 22:56.636
MG?

23:05.645 --> 23:07.429
Hope?

23:11.651 --> 23:13.087
Are you okay?

23:13.130 --> 23:14.610
I don't think so.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.438
Where are we?

23:16.482 --> 23:18.788
Malivore sent us back to
the night that you killed Landon

23:18.832 --> 23:20.747
and activated his
phoenix powers.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.618
But it's just a head dive.

23:22.662 --> 23:23.880
None of it's real.

23:23.924 --> 23:26.622
Then why does it feel real?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.450
Hey, we can use this
to our advantage.

23:28.494 --> 23:29.799
We know what happens next.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.236
So if it feels real,
then my blood will, too.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.282
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.112
At least not until you've heard
my offer.

23:48.165 --> 23:51.734
Doc, I don't know
how long I can hold it.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.302
The hunger's too strong.
I need to feed.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.478
Just breathe, okay?
Let it pass.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.742
I killed all those people.

23:59.786 --> 24:02.484
Why didn't
you tell me?

24:02.528 --> 24:03.572
'Cause you didn't need to know.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.269
What matters is
right now, okay?

24:05.313 --> 24:06.662
And that you can beat this.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.123
Landon?

24:33.167 --> 24:34.647
In the flesh.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.605
Well, not technically.

24:36.649 --> 24:39.347
Which is how you were able to
feed on me and I'm totally fine.

24:40.827 --> 24:43.177
That's my theory, anyways.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.180
How did... how did you find us?

24:46.223 --> 24:47.790
This place was lighting up
the darkness like a beacon.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.836
When I saw you two in trouble,
I just jumped in.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.490
I don't know,
I didn't think much past that.

25:02.718 --> 25:03.850
Landon Kirby.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.722
Finally.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.509
How long have I been gone?

25:13.555 --> 25:14.861
The answer's here somewhere.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.558
<i>Rezvendas.</i>

25:16.602 --> 25:17.994
I don't understand.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.648
We should be able
to pull them out.

25:19.692 --> 25:20.997
It's Malivore.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.521
He's keeping the head dive
in place.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.523
So Malivore is
this group project?

25:24.566 --> 25:25.698
We were trying
to sneak into his dimension,

25:25.741 --> 25:27.090
but now
everyone's stuck.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.701
Do you have any other questions?

25:29.615 --> 25:32.661
Just one. How can I help?

25:32.705 --> 25:34.576
This is strictly
witch territory.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.579
Got it. This spell that
can sever any mental connection.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.102
But it's a chain spell,

25:39.146 --> 25:41.191
so we can only draw magic
from a person,

25:41.235 --> 25:42.366
not the school.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.631
Taking this much
can be dangerous.

25:46.980 --> 25:47.850
We don't have
a choice.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.460
Siphon me.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.770
As much as you need.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.424
<i>
Hard pass.</i>

25:56.467 --> 25:58.469
I haven't offered
you anything yet.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.210
Don't bother.
All I care about is MG.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.777
That's cute, but we both know

26:01.821 --> 26:03.474
you care
about more than just him.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.607
Look, I know that
this is supposed to be

26:05.651 --> 26:07.566
mental torture and all,

26:07.609 --> 26:09.611
but this is the night
that I chose to save MG's life,

26:09.655 --> 26:11.221
after he'd just murdered
my boyfriend,

26:11.265 --> 26:13.049
so I don't know
if you can compete with that.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.747
I don't know,
I'm pretty competitive.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.402
All right, have it your way.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.491
I'll even help.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.412
Yeah, no, I feel nothing.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.762
Well, I feel better.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.938
I've been wanting to do that
all day.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.593
Okay, here's what I want to do.

26:34.636 --> 26:35.811
Offer you that deal.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.639
Just for kicks.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
Landon's here, Hope.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.730
You're lying.

26:41.774 --> 26:45.081
Okay, not <i>here</i> here,
but out there,

26:45.125 --> 26:46.953
in the darkness.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.433
He and I share a mind, remember?

26:49.477 --> 26:51.610
He's waiting for
you to rescue him,

26:51.653 --> 26:53.829
like always.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.744
I'm not gonna let you
manipulate me.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.964
I respect the resistance,
but come on, Hope,

26:58.007 --> 27:00.096
I'm giving you
the only thing you ever want.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.665
Hell, I'll even make it easier.
You follow that path...

27:05.667 --> 27:07.974
...it'll lead you straight
back to Landon.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.324
In the darkness.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.021
Beggars can't
be choosers.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.938
I promise,

27:15.982 --> 27:19.028
the time you spend with him
won't just seem real.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.989
It will be.

27:26.514 --> 27:27.776
But this is
a limited-time offer.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.039
- Stop doing that.
- Just leave MG to me and go.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.867
Because once
those lights are gone,

27:31.911 --> 27:34.043
your chance to find Landon

27:34.087 --> 27:36.045
will be, too.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.886
Are you sure you want to do
this? It can be really painful.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.801
I'm dating a Gemini, right?

27:52.845 --> 27:54.498
Got to get siphoned
at some point.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.544
I never told you
I was a Gemini witch.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.677
But I told you
I was nosy.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.375
I've been asking around.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.898
Researching.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.987
That's why you were
in the library?

28:05.031 --> 28:07.033
You could have
just asked me.
I would have,

28:07.076 --> 28:09.035
if you weren't
always running off

28:09.078 --> 28:10.384
on some super
secret mission.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.691
So I found a really
interesting book

28:12.734 --> 28:16.172
on your coven,
but there were pages ripped out

28:16.216 --> 28:18.044
in the section
about Gemini twins.

28:18.087 --> 28:20.916
- That's really weird.
- I know.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.702
- And I doubt it was an accident.
- I'm sorry
to break up

28:23.745 --> 28:25.442
this conversation,
but we're good to go.

28:32.928 --> 28:35.365
<i>
Anima Dimittere.</i>

28:35.409 --> 28:37.541
<i>Animo creverunt.</i>

28:37.585 --> 28:39.282
<i>Anima Dimittere.</i>

28:39.326 --> 28:41.371
<i>
Wow. That is a lot to process.</i>

28:41.415 --> 28:42.764
How many fake
me's were there?

28:42.808 --> 28:43.983
Three?
Two.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.855
Uh, it's a long story.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.901
Yeah, but you're not
about to miss any more.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.076
'Cause your girl is
working on a way...Shh, shh.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.731
No details.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.124
Everything I know, he knows.

28:55.168 --> 28:59.650
The point is,
Hope is on the case.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.435
That's the problem.

29:01.478 --> 29:03.219
What I just heard

29:03.263 --> 29:04.960
were all the ways that Hope,

29:05.004 --> 29:07.963
you guys, everyone
has put themselves in danger

29:08.007 --> 29:10.052
one way or another
because of me.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.098
Landon, this...

29:12.141 --> 29:14.622
- this is not your fault.
Man, it's Malivore, man.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.145
I keep saying,

29:16.189 --> 29:18.452
- that bitch is everywhere.
He and I

29:18.495 --> 29:20.410
share a body and a mind.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.630
I keep playing it out
in my head,

29:22.673 --> 29:24.066
and every which way I try,

29:24.110 --> 29:26.242
I keep coming
to the same conclusion.

29:26.286 --> 29:27.940
As long as I am the
only viable vessel

29:27.983 --> 29:30.681
for Malivore,
this ends one of two ways:

29:30.725 --> 29:32.814
my body dead...

29:32.858 --> 29:35.469
or Hope becoming the Tribrid.

29:37.297 --> 29:40.691
I will do anything to avoid
one of those endings.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.956
We can't let that happen
to Hope.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.914
If we kill your body,

29:45.958 --> 29:49.657
that'd be closing the last door
in or out of Malivore.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.791
You'd be trapped here.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.010
Yeah.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.146
It'll suck.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.843
But infinite nothingness beats
some of the things

30:01.887 --> 30:03.802
I've been through in my life.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.892
I'll cope.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.900
When the time comes...

30:17.163 --> 30:19.252
...do it.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.430
Promise me.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.876
This is taking longer
than I thought.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.400
- Shut up.
- Damn.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.011
Do you have any idea
how much effort

30:39.054 --> 30:40.534
it must have taken
for him to manage that?

30:40.577 --> 30:42.014
I'm almost rooting
for you now, buddy.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.146
So what is it
gonna be, Hope?

30:44.190 --> 30:45.887
You gonna heal him?

30:45.931 --> 30:47.933
You gonna go
after Landon?

30:49.238 --> 30:51.501
I guess the choice
wasn't clear.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.373
I can't let you do both.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.900
What happens to him
if I go?

30:58.944 --> 31:00.859
It's not your problem.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.382
You'll have Landon.

31:04.036 --> 31:06.212
Isn't that
what you want?

31:13.741 --> 31:15.569
It's...

31:15.612 --> 31:18.877
it's okay, Supergirl.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.530
I get it.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.794
LANDON
If he thinks you are Supergirl,

31:23.838 --> 31:25.884
then we have officially reached
the delusional stage.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.150
You're really cutting it close.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.501
You're so sure of my decision.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.941
Why wouldn't you be?
I've proven over and over again

31:39.985 --> 31:41.464
that it's
always gonna be Landon.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.773
I'm so sorry, MG.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.959
Oh, well, whatever.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.483
The next round of torture
is going to be even worse.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.311
Why are you doing this?

32:02.355 --> 32:04.835
Why even offer me a deal?
What do you want?

32:04.879 --> 32:06.794
Yeah, see?

32:06.837 --> 32:10.015
I'm torturing you already.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.983
Hope, what happened
in there?

32:22.027 --> 32:23.985
We found Cleo.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.161
But we didn't get
the answers we wanted.

32:26.205 --> 32:28.076
Did you find
anything?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.948
Any sign of Landon?

32:32.211 --> 32:32.951
No.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.344
No, we didn't.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.844
I know today was rough,
but, um,

32:56.887 --> 32:59.107
I didn't know it was
ice cream rough.

32:59.151 --> 33:02.154
Yeah, it's my... my second.

33:02.197 --> 33:04.852
I just figured I'd
come up here and...

33:04.895 --> 33:07.376
reminisce about simpler times.

33:07.420 --> 33:11.815
You know, when my boyfriend
wasn't a sadistic jackass.

33:11.859 --> 33:12.903
So please

33:12.947 --> 33:14.340
come on in,

33:14.383 --> 33:15.863
save me from myself.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.299
Pretty sure
you were the one

33:17.343 --> 33:19.084
doing all the saving today.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.175
Well, we're still down
two Squad members,

33:23.218 --> 33:24.872
so let's face it,

33:24.915 --> 33:27.135
we got our asses kicked today.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.659
I respectfully disagree.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.183
The way I see it,
we won--

33:31.226 --> 33:34.055
not the war,
but an important battle.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.492
Malivore
was just toying with us.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.581
I mean, we don't even know
what he wants.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.018
What he wants

33:40.061 --> 33:42.150
is to drive a wedge between us,

33:42.194 --> 33:44.065
to turn us all
against each other,

33:44.109 --> 33:45.675
to isolate you.

33:45.719 --> 33:48.678
Which makes us all weaker.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.072
How do you know?

33:51.116 --> 33:53.944
'Cause that's what bullies do.

33:53.988 --> 33:56.208
And he failed.

33:56.251 --> 34:01.082
We are more together than
we have been in a long time.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.693
Especially...

34:03.737 --> 34:05.260
me and you.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.263
Okay,

34:08.307 --> 34:10.265
Mr. Bright Side,

34:10.309 --> 34:12.963
your plan today was
brilliant, so...

34:13.007 --> 34:15.749
tell me, what do we do next?

34:16.750 --> 34:18.926
I don't know.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.363
But as long as

34:21.407 --> 34:23.757
we do it together,
we'll beat him.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.587
If I were him, I'd be scared.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.591
I bet Cleo's scared, too.

34:32.592 --> 34:36.117
At least she knows
we're coming for her.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.729
If the Salvatore School
has taught me anything,

34:39.773 --> 34:43.603
it's that a little Hope goes
a long way.

34:47.607 --> 34:48.608
I had to.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.002
<i>
I thought
I was better than that. </i>

34:52.046 --> 34:54.092
I killed all those people,

34:54.135 --> 34:56.137
'cause I
couldn't control myself,

34:56.181 --> 34:58.139
and I'd have done it
again today.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.228
Ah, Kaleb.

35:03.362 --> 35:05.320
Think of how far...

35:05.364 --> 35:06.756
you <i>have</i> come.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.933
17 minutes
you fought that urge.

35:09.977 --> 35:13.937
First time we met,
you attacked me within seconds.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.160
I call that growth.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.162
Then the only reason
I got a chance to grow

35:21.206 --> 35:22.598
is 'cause you
brought me here.

35:25.384 --> 35:27.255
You believed in me.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.607
And I don't think
I'd be who I am now

35:31.651 --> 35:33.435
if I'd known what I'd done.

35:36.003 --> 35:39.267
I guess you-- and MG,
now that I think about it--

35:39.311 --> 35:40.703
had a point.

35:42.488 --> 35:45.621
Sometimes the truth can do
more harm than good.

35:45.665 --> 35:48.363
At least
until you're ready to hear it.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.191
Yeah.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.845
Well...

35:51.888 --> 35:53.281
Hope isn't.

35:55.109 --> 35:57.720
Yeah, so...

35:57.764 --> 36:00.723
in that spirit, welcome
to my lonely little club,

36:00.767 --> 36:03.465
where the benefits are
Kentucky bourbon,

36:03.509 --> 36:05.728
sleepless nights,
and the crushing weight

36:05.772 --> 36:08.818
of trying to figure out how
to protect the people you love.

36:10.603 --> 36:13.083
Well, whenever you decide,

36:13.127 --> 36:15.173
I'll be right there.

36:17.044 --> 36:19.220
Backing your play.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.186
Hey.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.013
How are you feeling?

36:30.057 --> 36:32.015
I'm still a
little woozy.

36:32.059 --> 36:34.104
Is that some kind of remedy?

36:34.148 --> 36:36.411
No.

36:38.152 --> 36:40.110
But it is...

36:40.154 --> 36:43.897
salty and it has noodles.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.161
It's an apology in soup form.

36:48.162 --> 36:50.599
I don't need an apology.

36:50.643 --> 36:53.559
You can siphon me
till I'm dry, Jo.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.561
I just want to know why.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.128
'Cause I feel
like every time

36:58.172 --> 37:01.088
I try to learn something
about you and your world...

37:02.394 --> 37:04.265
...you push me away.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.050
It's not just how you feel.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.052
It's how it is.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.056
And I'd like to change that.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.276
It's just...

37:15.320 --> 37:16.756
hard.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.941
Would you rather...

37:29.508 --> 37:32.119
...have a relationship
that's fun,

37:32.162 --> 37:35.078
easy and stays the same,

37:35.122 --> 37:38.647
or one that's honest...

37:38.691 --> 37:40.475
hard...

37:40.519 --> 37:43.435
and grows?

37:45.001 --> 37:47.134
Both.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.658
You have to pick one this time.

37:54.359 --> 37:55.751
Then the latter.

37:55.795 --> 37:58.624
But I don't want
to scare you off.

37:58.667 --> 38:02.454
There are a lot of obstacles

38:02.497 --> 38:06.153
that come with being
a Gemini witch.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.460
The kind

38:08.503 --> 38:10.723
that make
the people you love leave.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.683
Do I look like I scare easy?

38:19.384 --> 38:22.735
The pages that were missing
in that book...

38:23.736 --> 38:25.651
...are about something called
the Merge.

38:36.575 --> 38:39.186
Am I interrupting
something?

38:39.229 --> 38:40.666
Just my latest

38:40.709 --> 38:41.884
existential crisis.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.146
Well, I know Josie

38:43.190 --> 38:45.366
usually handles those, but...

38:45.410 --> 38:47.368
maybe I could give it a shot.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.198
I'm sorry

38:51.241 --> 38:53.809
for always crapping
on you and Landon.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.898
And it's not just
your relationship.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.378
I do it with my sister, too.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.554
Well...

38:59.598 --> 39:01.556
I've had enough therapy sessions
with Emma

39:01.600 --> 39:04.254
to know that this is
the part where I ask:

39:04.298 --> 39:06.387
why do you think that is?

39:07.432 --> 39:09.390
Because you guys...

39:09.434 --> 39:12.524
have something
that I never really had...

39:13.699 --> 39:16.702
...but I'm pretty sure
that I want.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.443
Love.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.403
The kind
that is soft

39:22.447 --> 39:26.320
and builds on mutual respect,
that grows over time...

39:27.321 --> 39:31.020
...and becomes something
that I would do anything for.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.501
Maybe you should be
having this conversation

39:33.545 --> 39:36.417
with MG, not me.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.420
I made it pretty clear to him
that I was open for business,

39:39.464 --> 39:42.554
but... he hasn't come around.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.861
Ethan has.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.559
Josie said
he asked you on a date.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.865
Which I promptly canceled.

39:49.909 --> 39:53.652
Okay, well,
maybe you should un-cancel.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.437
With everything that's going on,

39:56.481 --> 39:59.397
do you really think
that I'm ready for that?

40:00.659 --> 40:01.616
No.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.618
But...

40:03.662 --> 40:06.055
I don't think anybody's ever
ready for that kind of love.

40:06.099 --> 40:07.448
It just...

40:07.492 --> 40:09.276
happens.

40:09.319 --> 40:12.584
And then you try and hold
on to it for dear life.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.543
But when it gets hard,

40:15.587 --> 40:17.763
which... it will get hard,

40:17.806 --> 40:20.592
know that
your friends

40:20.635 --> 40:22.507
will always be there for you.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.814
Speaking of,

40:25.858 --> 40:27.642
do you mind staying
for a bit,

40:27.686 --> 40:30.123
just until I fall asleep?

40:45.530 --> 40:47.488
Show yourself.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.273
There is something
we need to discuss.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.495
I like the sound of that.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.499
Has inspiration already struck?

40:58.543 --> 40:59.848
Yes.

40:59.892 --> 41:01.633
But not for you.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.983
Then for who?

41:14.559 --> 41:16.343
It's a Squad thing.

41:16.386 --> 41:18.519
You wouldn't understand.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.654
Here's what
I understand:

41:22.697 --> 41:24.960
how to make you suffer.

41:25.004 --> 41:26.484
Maybe that'll
inspire you

41:26.527 --> 41:28.311
to give me what I want.

41:29.704 --> 41:31.532
Do your worst.

41:31.576 --> 41:35.536
I only need to endure it
till my friends rescue me.

41:41.020 --> 41:44.197
Hope? What's wrong?

41:44.240 --> 41:46.155
Nothing.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.636
I'm feeling
very inspired.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.465
I have an idea.
