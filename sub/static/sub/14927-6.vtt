WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.540
EDDIE, YOU'RE
NOT HELPING AT ALL!

00:06.574 --> 00:09.043
I PULLED A LAT
CARRYING IT OFF THE CAR.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.612
JUST GRAB HOLD
SOMEPLACE.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.816
GRAB IT!

00:22.456 --> 00:23.124
EDDIE!

00:23.157 --> 00:27.761
WHAT? I THOUGHT
WE WERE DONE.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.197
CLAUDIA?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.431
HEY, GUYS,
GET THIS UPRIGHT,

00:30.464 --> 00:32.133
I'M GONNA TRY
AND FIND CLAUDIA.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.201
CLAUDIA!

00:33.234 --> 00:35.836
CLAUDIA.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.106
HEY, CLAUD.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.140
CLAUDIA.

00:39.173 --> 00:42.676
DAD, I DON'T THINK
YOU WANT TO SEE
MOM RIGHT NOW.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.146
SHE'S GONE
TOTALLY CRAZY.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.250
MOM?

00:49.283 --> 00:50.184
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.686
WAITING
FOR MY TOAST.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.289
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.158
YES, THERE IS.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.260
MOM, WANT
SOME BUTTER?

00:59.293 --> 01:03.131
AUUGH! NO!
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

01:03.464 --> 01:05.699
YEP, SHE'S A NUTJOB.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.468
CLAUDIA?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.203
CLAUDIA.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.771
CLAUDIA?

01:10.804 --> 01:12.673
CLAUDIA.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.212
HEY, DAD, THERE'S
NO SIGN OF HER.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.549
SHE'S NOT IN THE SHOWER.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.218
I CHECKED.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.186
THANKS, ED.

01:25.219 --> 01:29.089
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK THE CAR FOR
MY BOX CUTTER.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.492
UH...

01:31.525 --> 01:34.528
CLAUDIA, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.298
I JUST...

01:37.331 --> 01:40.368
PUKED, AND I DECIDED
TO GET SOME AIR.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.684
YOU'RE SMOKING AGAIN?

01:56.717 --> 01:57.685
OK, THERE IS
A DIFFERENCE

01:57.718 --> 02:00.321
BETWEEN SMOKING ONE
CIGARETTE AND SMOKING.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.455
OH, YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.292
SO YOU'RE BUYING THEM
IN THE CONVENIENT
ONE-PACK THEN.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.927
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL,
SEAN? YOU USED TO SMOKE.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.564
YEAH, DAD, USED TO, OK?
10 YEARS AGO.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.934
OHH, MAN.
GOOEY GUMDROPS.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.537
MMM. HA HA HA HA!
YOU GO BACK. WHOO!

02:16.570 --> 02:21.175
MOMMY, LOOK AT ME.
I'M A GROWNUP.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.281
WE MADE A DEAL,
ALL RIGHT?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.516
WE DECIDED
TO QUIT SMOKING

02:28.549 --> 02:29.650
BECAUSE IT WAS
UNHEALTHY.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.553
OH, RIGHT, AND YOU DON'T DO
ANYTHING UNHEALTHY, DO YOU?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.922
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
FRIED FOOD YOU EAT?

02:34.955 --> 02:39.793
AND--AND YOU JAM
THOSE Q-TIPS SO FAR
INTO YOUR EAR, I MEAN...

02:39.827 --> 02:43.897
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO PUSH YOUR BRAIN OUT
THE OTHER SIDE OR SOMETHING.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.533
DO I SAY ANYTHING? NO.

02:45.566 --> 02:49.203
I DON'T BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT YOU ENJOY IT.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.672
I DON'T SMOKE.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.841
YOU--YOU--
YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.210
MY JOB IS INCREDIBLY
STRESSFUL.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.511
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I CAN'T RELATE.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.780
I MEAN, WORKING
IN THE SUBWAY
IS RELAXING.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.449
YOU KNOW, WHAT WITH
THE--THE RATS

03:01.482 --> 03:03.917
AND THE PITCH-BLACK
TUNNELS AND
THE 40-TON TRAINS

03:03.951 --> 03:06.287
SPEEDING 3 INCHES
FROM YOUR FACE.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.658
YES, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE.

03:11.892 --> 03:15.996
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
UNDER THAT NAME.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.998
YOU MOVED THEM
TO TABLE 9?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.601
YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE
ANYONE TO TABLE 9.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.736
HENRY, I CAN'T
TALK RIGHT NOW.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.837
JUST HIT HIM BACK.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.375
LOOK, I KNOW I SAY NOT TO,
JUST HIT HIM.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.942
RIGHT THIS WAY.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.544
YOU ARE NOT
GETTING A TABLE

03:30.578 --> 03:32.613
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
AL PACINO.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.682
HOO-AHH!

03:35.983 --> 03:39.653
I HATE EVERYONE,
EVERYONE WHO EATS.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.655
I HEAR THAT.

03:42.490 --> 03:45.493
MAN, THAT CIGARETTE
LOOKS REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.126
YOU WANT ONE?

03:46.159 --> 03:48.962
NO, NO.
I QUIT YEARS AGO.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.635
MAYBE JUST ONE PUFF.

03:54.668 --> 03:55.969
THANKS.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.706
THANKS.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.708
I GOTTA GET BACK.
SEE YA.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.010
YEAH, SEE YA.

04:16.424 --> 04:19.793
OHH, MAMA.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.463
OH, BOY,
THAT TAKES ME BACK.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.865
I USED TO LOVE
THAT FIRST DRAG

04:24.898 --> 04:26.534
WHEN I GOT UP
IN THE MORNING.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.001
OHH, NOT HELPING,
DAD.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.771
MMM. HOW ABOUT WITH
A CUP OF COFFEE?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.306
OHH!

04:32.340 --> 04:36.810
NOTHING LIKE A PALL MALL
AND A SOFT-BOILED EGG.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.547
I JUST HAD THE MOST
EMBARRASSING NIGHT

04:39.580 --> 04:41.081
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.450
AGAIN?

04:42.483 --> 04:43.751
Claudia: BABE,
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.619
I MADE A TOTAL ASS
OUT OF MYSELF

04:45.653 --> 04:47.388
AND NOW DEAN THINKS
I'M AN IDIOT.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.089
OH, COME ON,
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.860
OH, YEAH? I BELIEVE
HIS EXACT WORDS WERE...

04:52.893 --> 04:55.062
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

04:55.095 --> 04:56.797
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

04:56.830 --> 05:00.801
COME ON, GUYS LIKE A GIRL
WHO CAN MAKE 'EM LAUGH.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.936
I'M GLAD YOU THINK
MY PAIN IS FUNNY.

05:02.970 --> 05:07.007
I'M GONNA THINK IT'S FUNNY
WHEN YOU'RE IN ADULT DIAPERS.

05:07.541 --> 05:11.078
THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE
YOU'RE GONNA BE
CHANGING THEM!

05:11.479 --> 05:15.916
OHH, AH, SHE CAN'T TALK
TO HER FATHER LIKE THAT.
I'M GONNA GRAB A--

05:15.949 --> 05:16.784
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.718
YEAH,
YOU CAN GO HAVE
A TALK WITH HER

05:17.751 --> 05:19.487
AND THEN YOU CAN
AVOID THE TALK
WE'RE HAVING

05:19.520 --> 05:21.755
ABOUT THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE SMOKING AGAIN.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.825
OH, EASE UP,
SEAN.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.728
IT'S...HARD
TO QUIT.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.929
IT WAS FOR ME.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.933
BUT THE DAY CAME
I KNEW ENOUGH
WAS ENOUGH.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.969
OHH.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.839
OH, MAN.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.374
OH, MAN.

05:40.408 --> 05:44.745
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WERE DEER
ON STATEN ISLAND.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.447
IS IT DEAD?

05:46.480 --> 05:50.451
IF IT'S NOT,
WE GOTTA KILL IT.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.420
OHH.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.861
OHH.

06:01.895 --> 06:05.433
HOLY CRAP.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.803
I HIT A DWARF, TOO.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.772
IS IT DEAD?

06:11.805 --> 06:14.442
IF HE'S NOT...

06:14.475 --> 06:16.410
WE GOTTA KILL HIM.

06:21.081 --> 06:26.554
I THINK SHE WAS
TALKING ABOUT SMOKING
CIGARETTES, CHEECH.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.422
AND, EDDIE, THANK YOU.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.891
I--I APPRECIATE
YOUR ATTEMPT AT SUPPORT,

06:30.924 --> 06:32.793
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.861
MY SMOKING'S
NOT A PROBLEM.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.028
I JUST GET
A LITTLE STRESSED,
HAVE A LITTLE SMOKE--

06:35.062 --> 06:37.831
WHEN I GET
A LITTLE STRESSED,
I HAVE A LITTLE SMOKE.

06:37.865 --> 06:42.202
I DON'T HAVE TO SMOKE,
I JUST LIKE TO SMOKE.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.537
YOU SMOKE?

06:43.571 --> 06:44.805
NO! NO.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.907
YOU JUST SAID
YOU SMOKED
LIKE 10 TIMES.

06:46.940 --> 06:51.979
SISTER MIRIAM SAYS
PEOPLE WHO USE TOBACCO
ARE WHACKO.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.547
HA HA HA HA HA!

06:53.581 --> 06:56.850
JUST 'CAUSE IT RHYMES,
HENRY, DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE.

06:56.884 --> 06:57.918
Henry: DO YOU WANNA DIE?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.920
NO! NO, OF COURSE NOT.

06:59.953 --> 07:00.988
BECAUSE IF YOU DIE,

07:01.021 --> 07:02.823
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
PUT ON A SUIT
AND GO TO CHURCH.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.859
OK, LOOK, THIS IS NOT
A BIG DEAL, ALL RIGHT?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.928
THIS IS JUST
A COUPLE OF CIGARETTES.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.598
OH, YOU KNOW,
I WISH I'D HAD
THIS INFORMATION

07:10.631 --> 07:12.533
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.469
HEY, HEY, HEY, BABY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.738
HMMM.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.509
GOING TO THE STORE.
ANYBODY NEED ANYTHING?

07:21.542 --> 07:22.676
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.578
I'M GOOD.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.819
HEY, BABY.
WHOAH!

07:31.852 --> 07:33.721
DON'T DO THAT.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.556
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:35.589 --> 07:36.590
WHAT?

07:36.624 --> 07:39.827
CAN'T I BE ALONE
FOR A SECOND IN
MY OWN BACKYARD?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.662
SURE.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.964
JEEZ.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.937
Oh, crap.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.775
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.977
FIXING THE CAR.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.646
OHH.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.282
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.719
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M SURE
SOMETHING IS.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.588
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY
DOING OUT HERE?

08:07.621 --> 08:08.956
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE I JUST
LIKE IT OUT HERE.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.958
YEAH, THIS IS A REALLY
HAPPENING SPOT.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.294
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
CLAUDIA IS
PISSED OFF AT ME.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.896
WHAT'D YOU DO?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.197
HELL IF I KNOW.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.099
I'M TRYING TO THINK.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.102
HAS YOUR SEX LIFE
CHANGED IN ANY WAY?
NO.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.038
ARE YOU HAVING IT
WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.273
YEAH, YEAH,
I THINK SO.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.808
SHOULD I GO OUT
WITH HER?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.743
WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.679
I'M ONLY TRYING
TO HELP YOU, MAN.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.547
OK--AHH, MAN,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.682
THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF

08:34.715 --> 08:35.683
IS LAST SATURDAY,
ALL RIGHT?

08:35.716 --> 08:39.086
SHE ASKED ME TO GO
FURNITURE SHOPPING
WITH HER.

08:39.753 --> 08:40.420
OH, COOL LAMP.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.421
OH, YEAH.
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE

08:41.454 --> 08:43.691
WITH THE OTHER
300 LAMPS THAT
WE'VE SEEN TODAY.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.225
SEAN, WHAT IS
YOUR PROBLEM?

08:45.258 --> 08:46.393
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

08:46.426 --> 08:48.929
WELL, COULD YOU
AT LEAST PRETEND TO BE
ENJOYING YOURSELF?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.565
WOO HOO! WHOO!

08:51.599 --> 08:52.966
OOH! I LIKE THAT.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.269
OH, WHAT ARE YOU,
INSANE?
THIS IS HUGE.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.638
AH, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.206
OH, COME ON,
IT'S A CONDO.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.340
NO, IT'S AN ARMOIRE.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.843
OH, IT'S AN ARMOIRE.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.112
THAT'S WHAT THEY
CALL IT, AN ARMOIRE.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.179
OH, WELL THEN,

09:06.213 --> 09:07.715
WE SHALL BUY
THIS HERE ARMOIRE

09:07.748 --> 09:08.649
AND PUT IT IN
THE BOUDOIR

09:08.682 --> 09:11.051
NEXT TO
THE TOILETTE, HUH?
HMM, OOH LA LA.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.686
OH, GIMME A BREAK.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.255
OH, MON DIEU!
CHAISE LOUNGE!
HA HA!

09:15.288 --> 09:16.924
HEY, ENOUGH!

09:16.957 --> 09:19.026
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WAS THAT
BIG A DEAL?

09:19.059 --> 09:23.063
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
UH, YEAH, YEAH. I DID.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.635
THAT--WOW.

09:27.668 --> 09:31.038
THAT--THAT'S
JUST WAY TOO BIG.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.642
OH, IT'S TOO BIG.
OH, I HADN'T NOTICED.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.276
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
TO BUY IT.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.911
I JUST SAID
IT WAS NICE.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.681
THEN YOU FOLLOWED ME
AROUND FOR 45 MINUTES

09:40.714 --> 09:42.783
TALKING LIKE
PEPE LE PEW.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.085
WAIT, WAIT,
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT'S WHAT?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.887
WHAT IS THAT
UNDER YOUR BUTT?
NOTHING.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.856
WHAT IS THAT
UNDER YOUR BUTT?
MOVE.

09:48.889 --> 09:53.126
UH, LILY'S PURSE
AND A CELL PHONE.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.664
LILY! LILY!
GET YOUR BUTT
DOWN HERE!

09:56.697 --> 09:57.631
LILY HAS
A CELL PHONE?

09:57.665 --> 09:59.099
I KNOW, DON'T--
JUST DON'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL--

09:59.132 --> 10:01.334
I NEVER SAID
LILY COULD HAVE
A CELL PHONE.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.037
YEAH. I KNOW.

10:04.237 --> 10:08.241
OH, NO.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.277
OH, NO, YOU DID NOT.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.379
I--I HAD TO.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.815

I PROMISE I WILL.

21:09.969 --> 21:10.937
I PROMISE.
OK, GOOD.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.839
OK, YOU JUST STICK
THOSE Q-TIPS IN
WAY TOO FAR.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.642
ALL RIGHT, I'LL STOP,
I PROMISE.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.509
YOU PROMISE?
I DO.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.877
YOU BETTER.
I WILL.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.912
I'M NOT KIDDING.
OK.

21:31.658 --> 21:35.061
I'LL JUST HAVE ONE
WITH MY EGGS
IN THE MORNING.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.197
ALL RIGHT, CLAUD,
ANGLE IT THIS WAY.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.999
UNHHH!
NICE GRUNT.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.701
HEY, SHUT UP.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.436
PUSH FROM THE TOP.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.037
UNHHH!

21:45.071 --> 21:46.005
OHH, OHHH.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.640
ED, SHUT UP!

21:47.674 --> 21:48.908
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU TWO?

21:48.941 --> 21:49.909
NOTHING.
NOTHING, DAD.

21:49.942 --> 21:54.481
OK, CLAUDIA,
LET'S GIVE IT
A REALLY GOOD SHOVE.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.314
UHHH!

21:55.348 --> 21:56.516
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CLAUDIA, I GOT IT, BABE.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.586
JUST GO TO THE KITCHEN.
JUST TAKE--TAKE A BREAK,
ALL RIGHT?

21:59.619 --> 22:01.888
COME ON, EDDIE,
WE CAN DO IT.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.490
UNHHH!

22:03.523 --> 22:05.525
JUST NOT THE SAME.
