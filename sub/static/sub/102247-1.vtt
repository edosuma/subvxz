00:10.878 --> 00:13.112
I thought we talked about
flossing at your last visit.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.580
I floss.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.383
I don't think so.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.884
One of these
might have to come out.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.587
Denise, would you mind calling
Dr. Belling in here, please?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.255
Yes, Dr. Hall.
Right away.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.524
Oh, I hear you and Dr. Belling
are getting married.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.992
Two months from today.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.561
How did you two meet?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.964
Um, we were childhood friends.

00:31.999 --> 00:32.865
We fell out of touch
after high school,

00:32.933 --> 00:33.932
but then,

00:33.968 --> 00:35.667
my first day of dental school,

00:35.703 --> 00:37.736
I walked into
my Oral Pathology class,

00:37.805 --> 00:39.505
and sure enough, there he was.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.539
Some things

00:40.574 --> 00:41.774
are just meant to be.

00:41.842 --> 00:42.875
So where are you two going
on your honeymoon?

00:44.011 --> 00:44.943
Honeymoon?

00:44.979 --> 00:47.112
Uh...

00:47.148 --> 00:49.214
we haven't actually
talked about it.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.315
I think we've just been so busy

00:50.351 --> 00:51.583
that we haven't had time
to plan anything.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.818
My wife and I

00:52.887 --> 00:54.920
just took a six-week tour
through South America.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.288
Hiking in the Andes,

00:56.323 --> 00:57.923
Machu Picchu,

00:57.958 --> 01:00.826
and we went ziplined
over the Inca Trail.

01:00.861 --> 01:01.860
I highly recommend it.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.129
Sounds fun.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.532
Although, I'm not sure

01:06.567 --> 01:07.966
that's something
Dr. Belling and I would do.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.935
George doesn't really like
roughing it outdoors.

01:09.970 --> 01:10.936
Oh...

01:10.971 --> 01:11.937
It's just something

01:11.972 --> 01:12.638
you have to try
once in your life.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.174
It's like I told my wife,

01:15.209 --> 01:17.976
you don't regret
the things you do,

01:18.045 --> 01:19.711
you regret
the things you don't do.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.047
Like flossing.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.751
Denise!

01:25.786 --> 01:26.685
Thanks again
for your work today

01:26.720 --> 01:27.853
with Mrs. Gibson's crown.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.455
It was outstanding.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.290
Oh, thank you, Dr. Belling.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.558
That was a lot of fun.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.359
It was, wasn't it?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.495
Well, have a great time
on your vacation.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.663
Oh, it won't be vacation.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.064
No? I thought
you were going to the island

01:39.133 --> 01:40.365
to visit Dr. Belling's family?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.600
We are.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.701
But we are way too busy

01:42.736 --> 01:44.203
to think about having anything

01:44.238 --> 01:46.605
that even remotely resembles
a vacation while we are there.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.740
Our engagement party
is in a week,

01:48.776 --> 01:49.842
and we still have

01:49.877 --> 01:50.776
a lot of wedding planning
left to do.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.010
I'm sure it will go smoothly.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.612
You have been working on
that wedding itinerary

01:53.647 --> 01:55.080
for months, Dr. Hall.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.048
Thank you, Denise.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.153
Oh, George,
I almost forgot to tell you.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.489
I changed something
on the itinerary.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.257
I had to move our meeting
with the florist to 10:15,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.126
which then bumped
the cake tasting to 11:45.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.127
Is that okay with you?

02:08.195 --> 02:09.194
-Works for me.
-Great.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.162
Oh, and one more thing.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.196
I bought your mother

02:11.265 --> 02:12.498
a lovely blanket
for her birthday.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.632
Cashmere. So we can give it
to her at her party.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.334
Right. The surprise party.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.668
Shh.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.137
Remember, only you, me,
and your sister know,

02:18.172 --> 02:19.338
so don't tell anyone,

02:19.406 --> 02:20.372
because we don't want
your mother finding out.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.106
Of course.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.809
See you tomorrow.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.815
[¶¶¶]

02:34.889 --> 02:36.922
So, who's helping you
plan everything on the island?

02:36.957 --> 02:37.990
George's mom and sister.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.591
I think you met
Diana and Louise once.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.493
How is Louise?

02:41.529 --> 02:43.395
She's excited for the wedding.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.429
She recently moved home.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.198
-How come?
-Bad break-up.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.200
I think she just needed
a change of scenery.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.601
What about George's brother?

02:49.637 --> 02:50.536
Will he be at the party?

02:50.571 --> 02:51.837
David?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.405
I have no idea.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.408
He's probably off
traveling the world somewhere.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.110
He keeps sending George
these postcards

02:58.179 --> 02:59.811
from faraway places,

02:59.847 --> 03:01.113
like...

03:01.148 --> 03:02.748
hiking in Mozambique,

03:02.783 --> 03:05.384
or a camel ride
through the pyramids.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.619
That sounds amazing.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.554
Is he cute?

03:10.257 --> 03:12.191
I have no idea.
I haven't seen him in years.

03:12.226 --> 03:15.561
Imagine waking up every day
to a new adventure.

03:15.596 --> 03:16.528
You ever think
of something like that?

03:16.564 --> 03:17.963
When I was younger.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.431
Actually,

03:19.466 --> 03:21.166
I used to dream
about going to Europe.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.636
My parents tried to plan
this trip once,

03:24.672 --> 03:27.105
and they couldn't decide
where to go,

03:27.141 --> 03:28.674
and I didn't want to spend
the whole vacation

03:28.709 --> 03:30.142
listening to them argue,

03:30.177 --> 03:31.543
so I just asked
if I could stay home

03:31.612 --> 03:32.778
and spend the summer

03:32.813 --> 03:33.612
on the island
with George, Louise and David.

03:34.949 --> 03:35.847
That was a long time ago.

03:36.917 --> 03:37.950
And now I have

03:37.985 --> 03:38.750
my dental practice
to worry about,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.385
and...

03:40.421 --> 03:41.720
let's be honest,

03:41.755 --> 03:43.021
George really hates
to go anywhere new.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.762
Did you pack
the extra phone charger?

03:50.798 --> 03:51.763
Got it.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.898
-Aspirin?
-Check.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.467
So, Mr. Henry was telling me

03:55.502 --> 03:57.803
about this six-week expedition
he and his wife went on

03:57.838 --> 03:59.404
to South America.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.906
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

04:00.975 --> 04:04.610
They went hiking,
ziplining.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.611
It actually sounded
pretty amazing.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.712
Hmm.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.646
Sounds exhausting.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.780
Right.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.750
Well, I was thinking

04:11.785 --> 04:12.618
we might want to consider it
for our honeymoon.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.519
A six-week honeymoon?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.155
What about our patients?

04:17.224 --> 04:18.624
I'm sure we could find
someone to cover for us.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.626
Do you know how many people die
every year on ziplines?

04:21.629 --> 04:22.728
No.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.529
Neither do I,
but it's probably a lot.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.601
I'm sure you're right, George.

04:34.441 --> 04:38.710
[¶¶¶]

04:56.730 --> 04:57.896
Thank you for stopping.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.564
I know it wasn't
on the schedule.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.766
We were almost
at the house.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.267
I know, George,

05:02.336 --> 05:04.369
but the house
will still be there.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.570
Come on.
It won't be long.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.674
[¶¶¶]

05:10.878 --> 05:12.711
You folks,
sit anywhere you want.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.381
I think they only serve
raw oysters here.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.217
"Ring the bell,
pick a pie."

05:19.253 --> 05:22.654
"Three dozen oysters,
and your pie is on the house."

05:22.690 --> 05:23.488
[clanging]

05:23.524 --> 05:25.090
[cheering]

05:26.293 --> 05:27.592
You know
that oysters contain toxins,

05:27.661 --> 05:29.461
and toxins can cause
gastroenteritis.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.129
Yes, but Key lime pie does not.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.097
[waitress] Hey, folks.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.899
What can I get for you?

05:33.967 --> 05:36.268
Just a water with lemon
for me, please.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.770
I would like one slice
of Key lime pie, please.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.472
Oh, you can't have any pie

05:40.507 --> 05:42.341
unless you finish
a platter of oysters.

05:42.409 --> 05:43.308
House rules.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.610
Oh.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.645
Well, what if I were
to tell you

05:46.680 --> 05:48.814
that I have a shellfish allergy?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.148
I would tell you

05:50.217 --> 05:51.817
that you might enjoy
Burger Hut up the street.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.119
Fine. I will have
a glass of Chardonnay.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.320
Fancy.

This place seems fun.

Okay, here we go.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.066
No, no. No, no, no.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.201
I actually ordered
a glass of Chardonnay.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.036
We don't have that.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.271
-You don't have Chardonnay?
-No.

06:13.307 --> 06:14.906
And I am driving.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.875
Okay, leave that there then.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.909
Knock yourselves out.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.614
Can we leave now?

It's the office.
I'd better get this.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.948
Oh, you'll be on the phone
for hours.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.583
Come on, you're off the clock.

06:58.619 --> 06:59.751
I'm sure whatever it is,
Denise can handle it.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.052
What if it's an emergency?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.622
Then she'll call Dr. Willis.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.424
George, please.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.093
Fine.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.465
Hey, Louise.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.133
Hello. Hello.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.701
Not going to give your brother
a hug hello?

07:16.737 --> 07:19.004
Not now, George.
I have to find my keys.

[Elizabeth sighs]

07:21.308 --> 07:22.441
[George] Oh.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.743
Oh, but I will give
Elizabeth one.

Hi, Louise.

Hello, Mother.

Hi, Tilly!

Oh, there she is.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.153
My soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.755
It's so good to be here.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.056
I'm so happy
to have you both.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.157
[cell phone ringing]

07:39.193 --> 07:40.625
They've tried
calling me twice now.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.760
I really should get this.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.328
-George.
-Two minutes, I promise.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.796
This is Dr. Belling.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.097
What's all this?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.433
Oh, Eugene dropped it off
about a half an hour ago.

07:48.469 --> 07:49.701
It's for you.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.002
It's from some party store.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.137
Oh, those must be

07:52.172 --> 07:53.772
the decorations
for the engagement party.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.374
They weren't supposed
to arrive until tomorrow.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.542
I have it right here
in my list.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.277
Well, I guess
we're ahead of schedule.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.846
Oh, my.

08:00.881 --> 08:04.583
That is very detailed list,
Elizabeth.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.856
I don't think I've met anyone
quite as organized as you.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.457
Found them!

08:12.493 --> 08:13.358
Where are you off to, Louise?

08:13.393 --> 08:15.160
The airport.
To pick up David.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.194
David's coming home?

08:16.263 --> 08:17.295
Yeah, well,

08:17.331 --> 08:18.263
word has it

08:18.298 --> 08:19.397
that he's...

08:19.433 --> 08:20.532
arriving early

08:20.567 --> 08:22.100
for the...

08:22.135 --> 08:23.902
surprise birthday party
I'm not supposed to know about.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.870
No, no, no, no,no.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.872
Don't worry. No.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.940
I can act very surprised.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.408
I mean, don't forget

08:30.444 --> 08:32.110
I was the star

08:32.179 --> 08:33.879
of many high-school musicals
in my day.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.748
Oh! Oh!

08:36.783 --> 08:38.850
A surprise? For me?

08:38.886 --> 08:40.218
Oh, you shouldn't have!

08:40.287 --> 08:41.186
Oh...

08:41.255 --> 08:42.754
you are--
you're pretty good.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.089
I know.
I think I missed my calling.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.132
How's your room?

08:54.167 --> 08:57.035
Mother has officially
turned it into a museum.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.036
I wouldn't be surprised

08:58.071 --> 08:59.204
if she starts
charging admission.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.106
You think your house
is like a museum,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.774
don't you remember
that horrible yellow wallpaper

09:02.843 --> 09:03.875
at my house across the street?

09:03.911 --> 09:05.777
I vaguely remember.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.046
I used to love
coming over here.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.784
You all were so welcoming
and kind.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.920
That was my escape.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.688
There was always
something happening here.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.491
Including...

09:19.560 --> 09:20.926
those scavenger hunts

09:20.961 --> 09:22.327
your mom
used to throw for us.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.228
Oh, those.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.564
"Oh, those"?
They were fun.

09:27.134 --> 09:27.933
Maybe we should do one
this weekend.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.302
Really, Elizabeth?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.636
We're adults now.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.971
Haven't we grown
past all of that?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.140
I suppose so.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.012
Oh...

09:41.048 --> 09:43.048
look at the treehouse
your dad built.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.384
Peter was so handy.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.589
Still, it's amazing it's up.

09:54.962 --> 09:55.827
George?

09:55.862 --> 09:57.062
Hmm?

09:59.199 --> 10:00.699
You know, it's all right
to talk about him.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.936
It still feels like
he was just here yesterday.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.940
I just wish he could have
lived long enough

10:08.976 --> 10:10.141
to see what I've done
with my career.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.344
He would have been
so proud of you.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.422
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.523
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance

10:25.559 --> 10:27.392
to give you
a proper hello yesterday.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.693
I was running around like crazy.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.395
No, it's fine.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.663
How did everything go
picking up David?

10:31.698 --> 10:32.664
Oh, fine.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.065
You know David.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.433
I picked him up
at the airport,

10:35.469 --> 10:37.569
and the minute
we drove over the bridge,

10:37.638 --> 10:40.105
he insisted
on getting out and walking.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.539
He got up early and went
into town this morning.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.541
It's been so long
since he's been home.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.210
Yeah, I don't think
he's gonna stay for very long.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.412
You don't think so?

10:47.447 --> 10:48.380
You know David.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.481
He's a wanderer.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.449
A free spirit
traveling the globe,

10:51.485 --> 10:53.852
looking for
his next big adventure.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.487
I doubt that there's
anything in Echo Beach

10:55.522 --> 10:56.721
that's gonna keep him here
for very long.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.689
[knocking]

10:57.758 --> 10:58.590
[door opens]

10:58.625 --> 10:59.624
Hello, Louise.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.259
Hi, Eugene.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.527
Elizabeth, great to see you
back on the island.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.662
Hi, Eugene.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.398
Louise, that band
I was telling you about--

11:06.433 --> 11:07.899
they're playing
at the Brewery this Sunday.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.100
Would you like to...

11:09.136 --> 11:10.135
Sorry, Eugene.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.703
I'm just really busy.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.005
Oh. Well. Right.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.540
Of course,
if you change your mind...

11:15.609 --> 11:16.841
[Louise] Really busy, Eugene.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.544
Sorry.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.578
Catch you later.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.780
Thanks.
See you tomorrow.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.814
-Bye, Eugene.
-See you, Elizabeth.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.722
What?
What's that look for?

11:30.757 --> 11:32.357
He likes you.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.458
[laughs]

11:33.493 --> 11:34.693
Don't be ridiculous.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.394
Eugene's a mailman.
He likes everyone.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.596
No, he likes you.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.299
Please, Elizabeth.
That ship has sailed for me.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.867
Come on, Louise.

11:42.903 --> 11:43.868
You've got to give love
another chance.

11:43.904 --> 11:44.869
With Eugene?

11:44.905 --> 11:45.704
Why not?

11:45.739 --> 11:46.838
Well, because.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.740
Because why?

11:48.775 --> 11:50.542
Because...

11:50.577 --> 11:51.509
because I don't even know

11:51.545 --> 11:52.544
how much
a first-class stamp costs.

11:52.612 --> 11:53.578
That's why.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.612
That's your reason?

11:54.648 --> 11:55.947
It's perfectly valid.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.651
Have you ever
stopped to think...

11:59.686 --> 12:02.420
that Eugene McClain
of the U.S. Postal Service

12:02.456 --> 12:04.155
might just be your soulmate?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.124
He could be the one
who completes you.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.125
Well...

12:07.160 --> 12:08.426
I think that a soulmate

12:08.462 --> 12:09.594
should be someone

12:09.663 --> 12:11.996
that inspires you
to complete yourself.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.066
Okay.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.502
I've got to go pick up
the ice cream

12:17.537 --> 12:18.570
for your mom's surprise party.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.472
Oh, she is going to be
so surprised.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.740
Yeah.

12:23.009 --> 12:23.875
Thank you for doing that.
You don't mind?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.777
No. I love going into town.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.178
You never know
who you'll run into.

12:27.214 --> 12:31.483
[¶¶¶]

12:34.654 --> 12:35.687
-Hi. Welcome.
-Thank you.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.921
What can I get you?

12:36.957 --> 12:39.190
I would like
three pints of vanilla, please,

12:39.226 --> 12:41.059
but one of the pints I'd like
in two separate containers.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.460
In one of the containers,
I would like 1/4,

12:42.496 --> 12:44.562
in the other container,
I would like 3/4.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.498
Then I would like
two pints of chocolate,

12:46.533 --> 12:48.266
but I want a half pint separated
into two individual cups.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.734
Then I would like
three pints of strawberry

12:49.770 --> 12:51.436
distributed the exact same way
as the vanilla.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.338
-Right. Uh...
-Okay--

12:53.373 --> 12:55.740
I've got a typed-up list
for you, if you like.

12:55.776 --> 12:56.641
Double spaced.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.377
What's your name, my friend?

12:59.412 --> 13:01.012
[employee] I'm Ricky.
What's up, bro?

13:01.047 --> 13:02.147
Can I get a pint

13:02.182 --> 13:03.581
of the Chocolate Belly Booster,
please?

13:03.617 --> 13:04.582
Yeah. Thanks, man.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.322
Hi, David.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.057
Oh, hi, Elizabeth.
How are you?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.092
Bring it in.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.794
Oh...

13:15.862 --> 13:16.594
It's okay.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.630
So...

13:18.665 --> 13:19.664
David Belling,

13:19.699 --> 13:21.232
back from
his latest adventure.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.467
Here I am.

13:22.536 --> 13:23.902
And how does it feel
to be home?

13:23.970 --> 13:24.903
Feels good.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.004
Yeah.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.272
Amazing, actually.

13:27.307 --> 13:27.906
I'm really excited
to catch up with everybody.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.574
Hmm.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.309
Congratulations on the wedding.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.444
Very nice to hear
about you and George.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.412
Thank you very much.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.848
I've got to know.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.249
How did old Georgie
pop the question?

13:38.285 --> 13:39.884
Oh!

13:39.920 --> 13:41.219
Well, um,

13:41.254 --> 13:42.887
we were sitting
in the break room at the office,

13:42.923 --> 13:46.124
and we looked at each other
and thought we get along great,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.058
we're very similar,

13:47.093 --> 13:48.426
our practice is thriving.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.360
It just seemed like

13:49.396 --> 13:50.461
the most logical time
to do it.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.096
Sensible.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.097
Exactly.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.834
Thank you, David,
for understanding.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.602
-Of course.
-After all,

13:57.637 --> 13:58.903
life doesn't need to be
a romance novel.

13:58.939 --> 13:59.871
No.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.006
Who needs romance?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.845
So, how long
do you intend to be home?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.012
Not very long.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.747
I've been teaching
at a school in Mumbai

14:09.783 --> 14:11.416
and I promised my students
I'd be back soon,

14:11.451 --> 14:12.851
so...

14:12.886 --> 14:13.985
probably right after
the engagement party.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.420
Well, you will be missed.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.888
That was
a very nice thing to say.

14:16.923 --> 14:17.956
[Ricky] Hey, so,

14:18.024 --> 14:20.525
it's going to be $37.95
for the pints.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.228
I got this.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.529
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't need to do that.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.231
Sure, I got it.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.101
Richard,

14:30.136 --> 14:33.338
you wouldn't happen to take
Yen or Rupees, would you?

14:34.641 --> 14:35.607
I don't think so.

14:36.610 --> 14:37.342
I got it.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.878
Thank you.

14:39.946 --> 14:40.778
I'll get the next one, okay?

14:43.116 --> 14:43.882
Thanks, buddy.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.585
So is that a lucky charm?

14:48.955 --> 14:49.854
You don't recognize it?

14:49.890 --> 14:51.356
I do not.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.657
It's yours.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.426
You used to have it
on your backpack

14:55.462 --> 14:56.327
all through middle school.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.830
So how did you end up with it?

14:58.865 --> 14:59.797
Funny story.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.200
When we were about 12 years old,

15:02.235 --> 15:04.168
me, you, Louise, George,
we went to the movies.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.873
I was being myself,
as I am,

15:08.909 --> 15:11.342
but you decided to report me
to the usher for speaking.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.112
Oh, I am sure I didn't do that.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.813
Oh, you most certainly did.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.349
And while you three were
walking off into the sunset,

15:18.385 --> 15:21.986
and I was being accosted
by security,

15:22.022 --> 15:24.122
this rabbit's foot
fell off your bag.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.156
I picked it up.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.057
I was going
to give it back to you,

15:26.092 --> 15:28.459
but then I thought to myself...

15:28.495 --> 15:29.761
"No."

15:29.796 --> 15:32.130
Wow, David.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.831
I'm so sorry
that I annoyed you that day.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.734
"Annoyed" is a bit
of a strong word, but...

15:36.770 --> 15:37.635
you used it.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.139
Napkins?

15:42.509 --> 15:45.877
Do you realize the hundreds
of annoying things

15:45.912 --> 15:47.478
you used to do on a daily basis?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.249
No.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.650
But you should have
said something.

15:52.686 --> 15:53.851
I did!

15:53.887 --> 15:55.086
You just don't remember!

15:55.121 --> 15:56.888
Well, that just sounds
very plausible.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.390
How about this--

15:59.459 --> 16:01.025
let's take this opportunity

16:01.094 --> 16:02.393
for you to get off your chest

16:02.429 --> 16:04.195
all the things I ever did
to annoy you.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.363
Let me have it.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.497
How much time do you have?

16:07.667 --> 16:08.800
Alright, there was the time

16:08.868 --> 16:10.868
your dad drove us
to get a Christmas tree.

16:10.904 --> 16:11.970
You yelled shotgun,

16:12.005 --> 16:13.471
ran ahead of everyone,

16:13.506 --> 16:16.708
and made us wait outside the car
for over an hour.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.009
-I did that.
-Mm-hmm.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.079
Or July 4, 1997.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.214
Do you remember
what happened that day?

16:23.249 --> 16:24.515
Fireworks?

16:24.551 --> 16:26.784
You snatched
the fries off of my plate

16:26.820 --> 16:28.252
and stole my soda.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.887
Wow.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.122
What a monster.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.757
Just a thought--

16:32.792 --> 16:35.193
-1997 that was?
-Uh-huh.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.428
Maybe you should
let that one go.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.663
See you back
at the house, David.

16:38.732 --> 16:39.864
Bye, Lizzie.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.402
Alright. Shh, shh, shh.
She's coming.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.204
Gran, come here.
You've got to hide.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.539
Yeah, come on.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.678
[door opens]

16:56.816 --> 16:58.316
Surprise!

16:58.385 --> 16:59.851
Oh!

16:59.886 --> 17:01.853
I can't believe it!

17:01.888 --> 17:03.321
What a surprise!

17:03.356 --> 17:05.356
Somebody told her.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.458
Yes, they did.

17:07.494 --> 17:08.426
It was--

17:08.461 --> 17:09.360
It was me.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.362
[Louise] David!
How could you?

17:11.398 --> 17:13.331
I'm a terrible person.
What do you want?

17:16.102 --> 17:16.968
[laughing]

17:19.305 --> 17:20.304
You know,

17:20.340 --> 17:21.973
you don't have to take the blame

17:22.008 --> 17:23.941
for something
that you didn't do.

17:25.678 --> 17:26.711
Ah, so it was you
who spilled the beans.

17:27.781 --> 17:28.913
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.381
You know, come to think of it,

17:30.417 --> 17:31.816
you would have been
my most likely suspect.

17:33.787 --> 17:34.886
Naughty.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.562
Thank you.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.464
Thank you, all,
for this wonderful surprise.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.334
My wish was that Peter
could see us all together

17:50.370 --> 17:51.969
having such a marvelous time.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.438
He's right here with us, Mom.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.109
If I could just take a minute

17:58.144 --> 17:59.644
to talk about
my wonderful children...

17:59.712 --> 18:01.012
Oh, get ready for the annual

18:01.047 --> 18:03.181
"why I'm so proud
of my children" speech.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.917
I mean, just look at
my extraordinary son, George.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.553
Getting married
to the most wonderful girl.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.321
I mean, the Belling family

18:10.356 --> 18:13.024
has been in love with Elizabeth
for it seems like forever.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.993
And George and Elizabeth's
dental practice

18:16.029 --> 18:17.895
is just thriving.

18:17.931 --> 18:18.796
[cell phone buzzing]

18:18.865 --> 18:20.231
Excuse me.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.299
Hello? This is Dr. Belling.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.767
Now, where was I?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.735
Oh, yes.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.606
I want to say how proud I am
of my amazing daughter, Louise.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.941
An award-winning artist.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.877
And my truly remarkable
son, David.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.679
Travels the globe,

18:34.714 --> 18:36.981
teaching children in need.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.382
You're such a good man.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.118
Thank you.
Very kind.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.519
If you ask me...

18:42.622 --> 18:43.888
Here we go...

18:43.923 --> 18:46.124
David needs to stay
in one place and get married

18:46.159 --> 18:47.024
like his brother.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.927
I got married at 18.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.762
What's your problem, mister?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.164
[David]
It's a fair point, Gran.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.432
The answer to that

18:54.467 --> 18:57.101
is I just can't find someone
as special as you.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.670
Yeah, yeah, always the charmer.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.273
You, listen to me.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.375
Yes, Ma'am.

19:04.410 --> 19:07.812
Love is not something you find.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.714
Love is something
that finds you--

19:09.749 --> 19:10.915
when you least expect it.

19:16.022 --> 19:16.988
George, what is it?

19:17.023 --> 19:18.256
Oh, it's Mrs. Valenzuela.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.557
She says she has
an unbearable toothache.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.559
Well, can't Dr. Willis
handle it?

19:21.594 --> 19:23.995
You know Mrs. Valenzuela
and her dental anxiety.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.330
She had such a bad experience
with her last dentist.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.765
Her son said
she'd only see me.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.901
Well, I don't blame her.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.202
I can't think of
a more brilliant dentist

19:31.271 --> 19:32.537
to handle whatever problem
she's having.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.272
Well, I'll only be gone
the night.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.239
I've scheduled for her
to come in

19:35.308 --> 19:36.340
first thing in the morning.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.909
Will you survive
without me?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.911
Mm. I'll try.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.479
I'm going to grab my things.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.452
[thunder rumbling]

19:48.488 --> 19:49.921
Alright, go inside.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.991
Hello, Tilly.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.359
Big storm coming, George.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.627
Think so?

19:56.663 --> 19:57.695
Oh, yeah, look at those clouds.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.697
[storm rumbling]

19:59.732 --> 20:01.365
Drive safe, okay?

20:01.434 --> 20:02.466
Thank you.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.434
Hold down the fort.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.635
I will.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.537
Hey, George?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.408
I read that...

20:10.443 --> 20:13.611
that article that you wrote
in the dental magazine.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.079
What did you think?

20:15.114 --> 20:16.447
It thought it was
really interesting,

20:16.482 --> 20:17.615
especially the part about

20:17.684 --> 20:20.418
how oral infections in childhood

20:20.453 --> 20:23.421
could actually increase
the risk of that...

20:23.456 --> 20:25.323
that thing in adulthood.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.691
You mean atherosclerosis?

20:26.759 --> 20:28.759
That's the thing.
That's the thing.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.796
I thought it was very cool
how you figured that out.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.098
Well, you didn't understand
a word, did you?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.199
No, not a word,

20:35.235 --> 20:36.968
but...

20:37.003 --> 20:38.369
that does not make it
any less impressive, buddy.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.338
You're impressed?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.073
Of course.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.841
I'm very proud
of my big brother.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.410
Well, I'm...

20:46.446 --> 20:47.912
I'm very proud
of you, too, you know?

20:47.947 --> 20:50.481
Oh, I gotta hear this.
Go ahead.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.617
Sometimes,

20:52.652 --> 20:53.751
I...

20:53.786 --> 20:55.553
I wish that I could be as--

20:55.588 --> 20:56.520
liberated as you,

20:56.556 --> 20:57.521
and just take off

20:57.590 --> 20:59.056
and live day by day,

20:59.092 --> 21:00.424
as life comes.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.126
Well, okay.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.427
I'll book tickets
right now, George.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.295
Where do you want to go?

21:05.898 --> 21:06.764
Come on, why not?

21:08.067 --> 21:09.767
Well, that's just the thing.

21:09.802 --> 21:13.070
See, I'm not
a why-not kind of guy.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.705
I'm the guy that just asks why.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.575
Almost had you.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.676
Did. Almost.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.844
-You were gonna come.
-Almost.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.246
Have a good night, David.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.114
You too, buddy.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.048
Safe drive, okay?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.049
Thank you.

21:27.687 --> 21:28.486
[car engine starting]

21:42.535 --> 21:43.968
[thunder crashing]

21:45.938 --> 21:47.738
[loud rock music playing]

21:50.977 --> 21:52.343
What is going on?

21:54.113 --> 21:55.513
[loud rock music playing]

21:55.581 --> 21:56.547
I can't believe this.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.452
[loud rock music playing]

22:04.524 --> 22:06.724
[loud rock music playing]

22:09.762 --> 22:11.662
[David singing]

22:11.698 --> 22:12.830
David!

22:12.865 --> 22:13.998
David?

22:15.768 --> 22:17.335
[loud rock music playing]

22:17.370 --> 22:18.402
Cake?

22:18.471 --> 22:20.805
No, I do not want any cake!

22:20.840 --> 22:22.773
Do you realize
it's 2:00 in the morning?

22:22.842 --> 22:23.741
I'm surprised you haven't
woken up the whole--

22:23.776 --> 22:25.343
You seem a little tense,
Lizzie.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.844
I am tense!

22:26.913 --> 22:28.779
Because I was just woken up
by David's one-man rock band!

22:29.882 --> 22:31.015
Well, since you're up,

22:31.050 --> 22:31.882
why don't I get you
a little something?

22:31.951 --> 22:32.950
You could get me something.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.785
You could get me
turning down the music

22:34.854 --> 22:36.420
because some of us
are trying to sleep.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.456
You're absolutely correct.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.390
Some apology milk.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.591
I'm sorry.

22:40.626 --> 22:41.826
I'm still on Tibetan time.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.961
Well, the rest of us
are not on Tibetan time.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.363
The rest of us
are trying to maintain

22:45.398 --> 22:47.531
our usual eight and a quarter
hours of sleep per night.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.866
[pop music playing]

22:48.901 --> 22:50.634
That is a very specific amount
of time, Elizabeth.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.969
[music playing]

22:52.004 --> 22:52.903
I love this song!
Isn't it so good?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.238
It just makes you want to dance.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.840
No, I do not love that song.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.274
Feel free to help yourself
to that cake, alright?

22:57.310 --> 22:58.476
I'd rather not.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.978
Okay, fell free
to join me in a dance.

23:01.013 --> 23:01.879
I'm gonna be over here dancing.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.482
[¶¶¶]

23:04.550 --> 23:07.752
David, it is
2:00 in the morning.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.986
I want to go to sleep,

23:09.021 --> 23:11.055
I do not want
to have a dance party,

23:11.090 --> 23:12.556
and I do not want to eat
peanut-butter cake.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.192
Hold on, now.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.461
Is there peanuts in that?

23:17.497 --> 23:18.796
Yes.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.498
What's the matter with you?
Can't you taste them?

23:20.533 --> 23:21.832
[David clears throat]
No.

23:21.868 --> 23:22.833
You're funny.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.002
No.
[clears throat]

23:25.037 --> 23:26.704
That's not funny, David.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.638
[David gags]

23:30.476 --> 23:31.842
David! David!

23:31.878 --> 23:32.843
David, are you okay?

23:32.879 --> 23:34.311
David, wake up!
Wake up!

23:34.347 --> 23:36.380
-Wake up!
-Shh.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.348
I'm trying to sleep.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.483
[rages]

23:39.519 --> 23:40.951
Is that your idea of a joke?

23:40.987 --> 23:42.853
More of
a performance piece, really.

23:42.889 --> 23:43.888
You think it's funny

23:43.923 --> 23:45.055
to make me believe
you're dead?

23:45.124 --> 23:46.657
I was going for unconscious,

23:46.692 --> 23:49.026
but I'll be the first to admit
that I'm not a very good actor.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.228
You have been trouble
from the very start.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.330
You take nothing seriously.

23:53.366 --> 23:54.865
You break all the rules--

23:54.901 --> 23:56.834
and I don't like rule-breakers!

23:56.869 --> 23:58.769
So here's
what we're going to do, David.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.304
We're going to keep our distance

24:00.339 --> 24:02.506
for the rest of the time
you're home.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.341
We're going to be
like two ships

24:04.377 --> 24:05.743
passing in the night.

24:08.381 --> 24:09.747
That's poetic.

24:09.816 --> 24:10.881
I'm sorry.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.759
[George] Excuse me.
What's going on here?

24:21.828 --> 24:23.327
[man]
Lightning struck the bridge.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.563
[engine revving]

24:25.598 --> 24:27.097
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

24:27.166 --> 24:28.666
You can't cross the bridge.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.935
Island's closed.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.369
Inspector should
be here shortly,

24:32.405 --> 24:33.904
to let us know
how the assessment's going.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.105
Is there much damage?

24:35.141 --> 24:37.141
Well, far as I can tell,

24:37.176 --> 24:39.109
the lightning looks like
it might have got the kingpost,

24:39.178 --> 24:41.045
some of the framing braces,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.513
probably 10 or 12 transoms.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.148
Huh. I see.

24:44.217 --> 24:45.449
Well, then I will
just wait here

24:45.518 --> 24:46.717
until the repairs are done.

24:46.752 --> 24:48.953
Alright.
Suit yourself.

24:48.988 --> 24:49.920
Could be three or four days,

24:49.956 --> 24:50.921
maybe even a couple weeks.

24:50.957 --> 24:51.889
Two weeks?

24:51.924 --> 24:53.657
I--

24:53.693 --> 24:55.392
No, I need to get across
the bridge today.

24:55.428 --> 24:57.094
My engagement party
is on Friday,

24:57.129 --> 24:59.029
and I promised
to meet my fiancée today

24:59.065 --> 25:00.164
so that we could meet
with the...

25:00.199 --> 25:01.499
the florist,

25:01.567 --> 25:02.867
and the rental company,

25:02.902 --> 25:04.235
and the wedding-cake designer.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.304
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
you and your fiancée,

25:07.340 --> 25:08.339
but you two lovebirds

25:08.407 --> 25:09.840
are gonna have to
plan your wedding

25:09.876 --> 25:10.841
from this side of the bridge.

25:14.814 --> 25:15.913
Hmm. Hmm-hmm!

25:24.624 --> 25:26.156
Good morning, Tilly.
How are you?

25:26.192 --> 25:27.157
[Tilly groans]

25:28.628 --> 25:30.528
Well, I'm good.
Thank you for asking.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.595
How did you sleep?

25:32.765 --> 25:34.365
How did I sleep?
Oh, I slept like a baby.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.101
How about you?
What's your name?

25:37.136 --> 25:38.102
[Tilly groans]

25:39.138 --> 25:40.771
Tilly. Shh.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.972
You're right there.
She can hear you.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.107
[scoffs]

25:43.142 --> 25:44.308

25:46.913 --> 25:48.178
-[Elizabeth] Hello? George?
-[George]<i> Hello?</i>

25:48.214 --> 25:49.947
[Elizabeth] You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

25:49.982 --> 25:50.981
The bridge?

25:51.017 --> 25:52.850
Did you just say
lightning strike?

25:52.885 --> 25:55.019
<i> [static, garbled conversation]</i>

25:55.054 --> 25:56.520
Hello? George?

25:56.589 --> 25:58.155
You're breaking up again.
I can't hear you.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.423
<i> [static, garbled conversation]</i>

26:05.464 --> 26:06.964
Did you hear about
a lightning strike

26:06.999 --> 26:07.898
on the bridge?

26:07.967 --> 26:10.134
Yes.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.436
So why didn't you tell me?

26:13.873 --> 26:15.205
Two ships
passing in the night, right?

26:25.585 --> 26:28.919
[¶¶¶]

26:35.127 --> 26:36.293
Oh, hi.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.828
Need a ride?

26:37.863 --> 26:38.796
No thank you.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.564
Are you sure?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.266
Looks like you've got
a lot of junk in your hands.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.701
It isn't junk.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.069
It's important research.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.637
I'm planning a wedding,
you know?

26:46.672 --> 26:47.972
Oh, I do know.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.707
I also know
George has got your car,

26:49.742 --> 26:50.741
so why don't you hop in,

26:50.810 --> 26:51.675
I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

26:51.711 --> 26:52.943
I'm just going
to the florist,

26:52.979 --> 26:54.144
only a few blocks away.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.746
Perfect. I'll get you there
in two minutes.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.715
I'm fine.
Have a nice day.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.483
Look, Lizzie. Stop.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.853
You're marrying my brother.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.123
We're going to be family.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.124
For George's sake,

27:07.193 --> 27:08.926
how about you and I
call a truce?

27:11.364 --> 27:13.130
For George?

27:13.199 --> 27:14.498
Alright.

27:14.533 --> 27:15.399
Truce.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.536
Well, hold on, now.

27:19.572 --> 27:20.971
Are you sure
you don't want a ride?

27:24.243 --> 27:25.876
Okay, but only if you promise
to stay inside the vehicle

27:25.911 --> 27:26.877
while I'm talking
to the vendors. Deal?

27:26.912 --> 27:28.612
Deal. Hop in.

27:33.853 --> 27:38.555
[¶¶¶]

27:43.729 --> 27:47.097
[¶¶¶]

27:52.004 --> 27:53.537
Let's go for a walk.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.807
Good girl.
Hey, hey, hey.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.042
Wait for me.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.544
So, as you can see
from my notes and diagrams,

28:00.579 --> 28:01.612
I have a pretty clear idea

28:01.647 --> 28:02.780
of what I want
the cake to look like.

28:02.815 --> 28:03.947
I see.

28:03.983 --> 28:06.650
A six-tier monochromatic cake,

28:06.686 --> 28:08.152
with sugar petals down the side,

28:08.187 --> 28:11.422
and then a single sugar pearl
at the tip of each leaf.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.756
Lovely.
We can do that.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.358
Great.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.259
Be with you in a minute, sir.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.593
I'm good.

28:16.629 --> 28:17.628
Thank you.

28:21.767 --> 28:22.800
Excuse me just one moment.

28:25.438 --> 28:26.470
What are you doing?

28:26.505 --> 28:28.439
-Is this lemon?
-We had a deal.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.873
You were going to wait outside
until I finished my meetings.

28:31.010 --> 28:31.842
Now, why don't you just sit down

28:31.877 --> 28:33.010
and...

28:33.045 --> 28:34.311
try not to interrupt.

28:35.448 --> 28:36.346
I can do that.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.150
I'm so sorry, Sylvia.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.352
Um... right.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.655
So I would like a vanilla cake.

28:44.690 --> 28:45.723
All vanilla.

28:45.758 --> 28:46.657
Nothing but vanilla.

28:46.692 --> 28:47.624
A lot of vanilla.

28:48.861 --> 28:49.693
Did you say something?

28:49.729 --> 28:51.495
No.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.996
Sorry to interrupt.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.631
You were saying
how fond you were of vanilla.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.301
[sighs]

28:57.336 --> 28:59.002
I mean, imagine, if you will,

28:59.071 --> 29:01.238
a world
where only vanilla exists--

29:01.273 --> 29:02.506
no butterscotch, no coconut,

29:02.541 --> 29:04.808
no rocky road.

29:04.844 --> 29:09.146
I suspect in a vanilla world,
oceans wouldn't get crossed,

29:09.181 --> 29:10.647
mountains never climbed,

29:10.683 --> 29:13.250
civilizations never discovered.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.218
Perhaps I'm being dramatic.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.552
Mm!

29:15.588 --> 29:19.423
This is not about Magellan
discovering a new world.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.625
This is about my wedding cake.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.193
You're absolutely right.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.261
I apologize.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.130
I'm just gonna sit here.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.203
Um...

29:33.239 --> 29:34.171
where were we?

29:34.206 --> 29:35.472
Sugar petals.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.207
Right. Uh, sugar petals.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.842
So, the, um--

29:38.878 --> 29:44.181
the floral-inspired decor
would...

29:44.216 --> 29:45.415
um...

29:47.853 --> 29:48.986
You think vanilla is dull?

29:50.956 --> 29:52.489
I think vanilla is playing it
a little bit safe.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.324
And from my observation,

29:54.360 --> 29:56.293
all the years
that I've known you, Elizabeth,

29:56.362 --> 29:57.427
you do tend to play it safe.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.763
Maybe it's because
you want people to think

29:59.799 --> 30:03.367
that you're a responsible,
practical, safe person,

30:03.402 --> 30:05.169
but, deep down,

30:05.204 --> 30:09.406
I think you're actually
a Neapolitan ice-cream sundae,

30:09.441 --> 30:11.475
with sprinkles,

30:11.510 --> 30:12.643
maybe even
a little cherry on top.

30:15.381 --> 30:19.016
If you'd just
let go once in a while,

30:19.084 --> 30:20.884
you might discover
that you're not vanilla--

30:20.920 --> 30:22.052
not at all.

30:23.656 --> 30:24.788
Sylvia...

30:25.958 --> 30:27.224
let's go with the vanilla.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.793
You got it.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.469
You think I'm dull, don't you?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.507
No. In fact,

30:43.542 --> 30:45.209
that's the opposite
of what I was trying to express.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.210
Well, why don't you
just say it?

30:46.245 --> 30:47.678
I won't be angry.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.981
You think my life with George
is dull and uninteresting.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.016
At least compared to your life.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.118
Well...

30:55.154 --> 30:56.453
someone's gotta
hold down the fort

30:56.488 --> 30:58.121
so us crazies can act out.

31:00.659 --> 31:01.758
Well, maybe...

31:03.629 --> 31:04.728
Nothing.

31:04.763 --> 31:05.529
No, go ahead.
You started.

31:05.564 --> 31:06.496
Maybe what?

31:06.532 --> 31:07.831
Maybe, sometimes,

31:07.867 --> 31:09.933
I get a bit sick
of holding down the fort.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.871
Maybe I don't wanna be
just vanilla.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.040
Maybe I wanna be...

31:17.076 --> 31:18.675
chocolate and strawberry, too.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.745
Alright.

31:21.780 --> 31:22.613
[Elizabeth]
Wait, where are we going?

31:22.648 --> 31:23.513
[David] You'll see.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.918
Hold on, Magellan.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.020
You're about to discover
a whole new world.

[bell clanging]

31:32.224 --> 31:33.957
[cheering]

31:33.993 --> 31:36.326
You've been here before, right?

31:36.362 --> 31:37.561
Once.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.363
You grew up here

31:39.431 --> 31:40.464
and you've only been

31:40.499 --> 31:42.065
to The Flying Otter Oyster Bar
one time?

31:42.101 --> 31:43.867
Well, I don't know, David.
I didn't plan it.

31:43.903 --> 31:44.968
Well, we're going to fix that.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.570
Sandy, my everything.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.071
Hey.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.574
Lizzie, Sandy.
Sandy, Lizzie.

31:51.844 --> 31:52.910
[women together] We've met.

31:52.945 --> 31:53.810
Enjoy.

31:55.648 --> 31:56.647
Okay.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.282
You're gonna love this.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.584
We are going to finish
this entire thing.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.319
The bell's gonna ring,

32:02.354 --> 32:03.687
and we're gonna have that pie.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.557
Come on.
I believe in you.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.795
There it is.
Bottoms up.

32:14.900 --> 32:15.766
How was it?

32:15.801 --> 32:16.700
Delicious, isn't it?

32:17.770 --> 32:19.369
Mm-mm.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.138
That's terrible.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.042
But I want that bell to ring.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.210
I want that pie.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.512
That's the spirit.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.213
Okay, here we go.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.015
Let's dig in.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.317
This is yours.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.085
Throw that one down.
We're all done.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.253
A little for me.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.187
A little for you.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.356

Mm.

Nice.

33:22.668 --> 33:23.767
You got something right here.

I'll get it.

What?

33:35.614 --> 33:36.613
Do I have more cream?

No, you don't.

It's just crazy.

33:40.085 --> 33:41.718
What's crazy?

33:41.787 --> 33:43.653
You and George
are getting married.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.590
Yeah. That's happening.

33:47.826 --> 33:48.825
What about you?

33:48.861 --> 33:50.227
You ever think about
getting married?

Never in one place long enough.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.601
Hmm.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.369
Have you ever
even been in love?

I mean,

34:03.575 --> 34:06.176

in the sixth grade?

Oh, Melanie Greenberg.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.315
my poor little lips
were never the same.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.717
I'm being serious.

34:14.987 --> 34:16.053
Don't you want to be in love?

34:16.088 --> 34:17.020
Get married?

34:17.056 --> 34:19.122
Start a family?

34:19.158 --> 34:21.224
The whole circle of life thing?

34:22.394 --> 34:23.827
Nothing about me
goes in a circle, Lizzie.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.629
Or a straight line,
for that matter.

34:25.664 --> 34:26.763
Okay.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.131
So you're just going
to zigzag your way

34:28.200 --> 34:29.032
through the rest of your life?

34:30.069 --> 34:30.801
I don't know about all that,

but...

34:31.970 --> 34:33.236

34:33.272 --> 34:35.672

No thank you.

Come on, Lizzie.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.745
I'll zig, you zag.

It's okay to cut loose and have
a little bit of fun, Elizabeth.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.363
Stop it!

35:00.399 --> 35:01.398
[phone ringing]

35:01.433 --> 35:02.365
[David] No.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.800
No, no, no.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.069
George is calling.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.037
Well, call him back.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.138
I should take it.

35:08.173 --> 35:10.173
One song.
You were just getting into it.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.108
Two minutes,
we'll call him right back.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.678
I can't believe you did that.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.480
You just told me to do that!

35:16.515 --> 35:17.380
How do you feel?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.317
Like I am breaking the rules.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.986
Twirly.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.790
We've got a troublemaker
on our hands.

35:26.825 --> 35:27.958
We're going straight to prison.

35:32.197 --> 35:35.932
[¶¶¶]

35:35.968 --> 35:37.367
[knocking]

35:37.402 --> 35:38.401
-[Eugene] Hi, Louise.
-Hi.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.703
I hope I'm not interrupting.

35:39.771 --> 35:40.737
No, no, not at all.

35:40.772 --> 35:41.671
Come on in.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.380
What do you think?

35:53.519 --> 35:54.484
I like it.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.553
Really?

35:56.588 --> 35:58.288
Yeah. I like what you did

35:58.323 --> 35:59.656
with the reflections
on the water.

35:59.725 --> 36:00.824
[chuckles]

36:01.793 --> 36:03.660
You know, the other day,

36:03.695 --> 36:06.496
I noticed you were painting
something with mallards,

36:06.565 --> 36:08.732
and, well, I remembered

36:08.767 --> 36:11.968
that my father had one of these,

36:12.004 --> 36:14.538
and I thought maybe
it could keep you company.

36:16.074 --> 36:18.775
You know, like you artists say,
for inspiration.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.378
Thank you.
That's really thoughtful.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.747
Why don't you put it over there?

36:24.783 --> 36:25.815
-Here?
-Yeah.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.253
Oh, that's perfect.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.792
Yes! Well...

36:35.827 --> 36:36.993
see you around, Louise.

36:37.062 --> 36:37.928
See you.

36:56.281 --> 36:57.547
Mm!

36:57.583 --> 36:59.216
Smells so good in here.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.351
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.319
Hey, have you seen, Louise?

37:02.387 --> 37:03.853
Do you know,

37:03.889 --> 37:05.989
I think she's out
in the studio with Eugene.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.357
Really?

37:07.426 --> 37:09.192
Oh, don't get too excited.

37:09.228 --> 37:12.329
Our Louise has sworn off
relationships

37:12.364 --> 37:14.097
after two broken engagements.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.200
Oh, my gosh, look at the time.
I've got to get this to mother.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.335
Why don't I take it for you?

37:18.370 --> 37:19.302
You don't mind?

37:19.338 --> 37:20.737
Sure.

37:22.207 --> 37:24.307
Besides, before you know it,
she'll be my grandmother, too.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.013
Oh, Elizabeth.

37:30.048 --> 37:30.947
How wonderful to see you.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.115
Diana sent this for you.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.284
So much food.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.185
Who could eat so much food?

37:35.220 --> 37:37.120
[laughs]

37:37.155 --> 37:38.989
So how's
the wedding planning going?

37:40.225 --> 37:41.224
It's been interesting.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.760
George got stuck
on the other side of the bridge,

37:43.795 --> 37:45.262
so David has actually
been dropping me off

37:45.297 --> 37:46.563
at my appointments.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.331
Let me tell you
who's running that bridge.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.067
Nincompoops, that's who.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.135
[laughs]

37:53.572 --> 37:55.805
Want to know who else
is a nincompoop?

37:56.808 --> 37:58.942
Who?

37:58.977 --> 38:01.011
My grandson, George.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.145
What?

38:02.180 --> 38:04.814
Imagine leaving
a beautiful girl like you

38:04.883 --> 38:06.416
all alone on the other side
of the bridge.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.984
Oh...

38:08.020 --> 38:09.619
It was Mother Nature.

38:09.655 --> 38:10.920
It wasn't George's fault.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.291
Why, if I were a young man,

38:14.326 --> 38:16.293
and I saw you,

38:16.328 --> 38:17.427
I'd sweep you off your feet

38:17.462 --> 38:18.995
and never leave your side.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.931
Is that what Grandpa Lou did?

38:21.967 --> 38:22.899
He swept you off your feet?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.734
Not exactly.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.572
Let me let you in
on a little secret.

38:30.776 --> 38:33.176
Before I married Lou...

38:33.211 --> 38:34.177
I had a boyfriend.

38:34.246 --> 38:35.912
Oh!

38:35.947 --> 38:37.147
I didn't know about that.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.882
It's true.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.250
Martin Moretti.
Know him?

38:41.286 --> 38:42.585
Mr. Moretti?
The dry cleaner?

38:42.621 --> 38:44.521
Mm-hmm.
That's him.

38:44.556 --> 38:45.989
We both grew up together.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.727
We used to loved
sailing around the island.

38:52.264 --> 38:53.797
Going to see movies in town.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.699
And we just loved to go dancing.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.134
Boy, oh, boy,

38:58.170 --> 39:00.136
we were something else
on that dance floor.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.806
Every move perfectly in sync.

39:04.609 --> 39:05.875
People used to say

39:05.911 --> 39:07.744
that Martin and I
were a match made in heaven.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.380
So why didn't you marry him?

39:11.650 --> 39:13.883
Blah.

39:13.919 --> 39:17.287
Why would I want to marry
someone who is exactly like me?

39:20.158 --> 39:21.358
All right,

39:21.393 --> 39:23.727
then how did you end up
marrying Grandpa Lou?

39:23.762 --> 39:26.062
Well, you know,

39:26.098 --> 39:28.031
after we met,

39:28.066 --> 39:29.466
he really started
to grow on me.

39:30.802 --> 39:31.801
Little by little.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.171
He challenged me.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.573
And that was a good thing.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.978
And with him,

39:42.013 --> 39:43.613
I found
I could always be myself...

39:45.117 --> 39:46.483
the real Vivien,

39:46.518 --> 39:49.652
not to mention we had
this wonderful connection.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.291
We used to call it "that zing".

39:56.428 --> 39:57.727
"Zing"?

39:57.763 --> 40:01.164
Well, it's just...

40:01.233 --> 40:02.699
a feeling.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.734
You can't force zing.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.104
And you can't deny it
if it's there.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.974
Right.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.309
And even though
Lou didn't like to sail,

40:13.345 --> 40:14.577
and he didn't like to dance...

40:17.149 --> 40:21.251
every time that man
held me in his arms,

40:21.286 --> 40:22.986
I would just
go weak in the knees.

40:25.323 --> 40:27.223
Like jello.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.358
Every single time.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.628
I'm sure like you and David.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.030
You mean like me and George?

40:36.368 --> 40:37.467
That's what I said.

40:41.907 --> 40:45.408
[¶¶¶]

40:56.087 --> 40:57.787
Every time I come in here,
it reminds me of my dad.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.860
He used to read to us
from that chair right there.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.330
One of my favorite
childhood memories.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.998
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

41:09.067 --> 41:12.335
The best is when he read
"Robin Hood".

41:12.370 --> 41:13.436
He did the greatest voice of--

41:13.472 --> 41:14.737
[together] Friar Tuck.

41:14.773 --> 41:15.772
That's right.

41:17.342 --> 41:18.141
I loved the way
he did those voices.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.175
Me too.

41:19.211 --> 41:20.944
Look at these places.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.745
China, India, Nepal.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.080
It's all so beautiful.

41:25.383 --> 41:26.749
So is that how you do it?

41:28.587 --> 41:29.519
You just spin the globe,

41:29.554 --> 41:31.287
and point to a place,

41:31.323 --> 41:32.222
and that's how you choose
where to go next?

41:34.459 --> 41:35.291
It's a good start, no?

41:40.599 --> 41:41.531
The Himalayas.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.636
I wonder if, when you're in
these faraway places,

41:46.671 --> 41:48.071
if you ever feel like there's
a part of you that's missing?

41:50.876 --> 41:52.642
Sometimes, when I'm on
the other side of the planet,

41:52.677 --> 41:56.079
I sleep and I do dream of...

41:56.147 --> 41:57.146
being home.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.116
Sometimes, I wake up,

42:00.185 --> 42:01.851
and I long to be back
with the people I love,

42:01.887 --> 42:04.020
the people I left behind.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.156
That's why
you're so lucky, Lizzie.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.659
I'm so lucky?

42:09.694 --> 42:10.793
Yes, you're very lucky.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.228
Oh.

42:12.264 --> 42:13.496
There is a part of me

42:13.532 --> 42:14.464
that wonders
what it would be like

42:14.499 --> 42:16.933
to be that important person...

42:16.968 --> 42:18.701
for somebody else.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.004
And you have that.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.573
You're that missing piece

42:23.608 --> 42:26.175
that makes
someone's heart whole,

42:26.211 --> 42:27.377
like you said.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.785
The truth is, you can climb
the highest mountain...

42:37.022 --> 42:39.989
and swim the widest river...

42:40.025 --> 42:41.457
and still never find that.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.661
Oh, my goodness.
It's still here.

42:44.696 --> 42:46.696
What?

42:46.765 --> 42:47.797
You've got to come see this.

42:53.471 --> 42:54.304
Do you remember this?

42:58.443 --> 43:00.343
[Elizabeth]
How did you find this?

43:00.412 --> 43:01.477
[David] I watched you
write that note

43:01.546 --> 43:03.313
when you were 13...

43:03.348 --> 43:04.213
right over there.

43:05.584 --> 43:06.950
Then I watched you
stick it in this book.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.218
Of course,
I had to come read it.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.390
I wanted to go to Rome so bad.

43:14.426 --> 43:16.392
[David] Mm-hmm.

43:16.461 --> 43:17.660
I thought
maybe we'd go as a family,

43:17.696 --> 43:18.761
but then my parents split up.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.531
Look at all the places
I wanted to go.

43:21.566 --> 43:23.600
Trevi Fountain.

43:23.635 --> 43:24.901
The Colosseum.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.603
The Sistine Chapel.

43:26.638 --> 43:27.503
Did you ever end up going?

43:29.641 --> 43:30.673
No.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.208
No?

43:32.243 --> 43:33.276
Come on, Lizzie,

43:33.345 --> 43:34.544
you've got to go--
what's stopping you?

43:37.716 --> 43:39.682
I just can't see that happening
anytime soon.

43:40.819 --> 43:41.651
Maybe there's a piece
of your heart

43:41.686 --> 43:42.819
that's missing, too.

43:45.457 --> 43:46.856
A piece of you
that's in this list right here,

43:46.891 --> 43:48.758
that that girl wrote
all those years ago.

43:49.928 --> 43:53.496
[¶¶¶]

43:55.000 --> 43:56.165
I gotta call George.

43:56.234 --> 43:58.868
Yes, of course.
I'll leave you to it.

43:58.903 --> 44:00.136
Say hello to the man for me.

44:06.745 --> 44:11.381
[¶¶¶]

44:11.416 --> 44:12.749
[Louise] Where have you been?

44:12.784 --> 44:14.517
Inside with Elizabeth.

44:14.552 --> 44:16.285
Sorry.
Lost track of time.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.521
[Louise] That's nice.

44:18.556 --> 44:20.123
What's nice?

44:20.158 --> 44:21.858
That you and Elizabeth
are finally friends.

44:24.362 --> 44:25.528
You know,

44:25.563 --> 44:27.630
I think you bring out
a different side of her.

44:28.933 --> 44:30.066
Oh, yeah?
How so?

44:30.101 --> 44:31.401
I don't know.

44:31.436 --> 44:35.071
I mean, when she's around you,
she's a lot lighter,

44:35.106 --> 44:37.006
and she's less Elizabeth
and more Lizzie.

44:38.543 --> 44:39.375
Yeah, she's pretty great.

44:39.444 --> 44:40.610
I know.

44:40.645 --> 44:41.611
I've been telling you that
for years.

44:43.281 --> 44:46.315
Well, don't you
just know everything?

44:46.351 --> 44:47.617
Ha, ha.

44:47.652 --> 44:49.719
I bet you regret all those years

44:49.754 --> 44:51.220
when you and Elizabeth
didn't get along.

44:52.657 --> 44:54.157
Yeah, between her lists,

44:54.225 --> 44:55.725
and my dancing and carrying on,

44:55.760 --> 44:57.093
we...

44:57.128 --> 44:58.628
thoroughly annoyed each other,

44:58.663 --> 45:02.065
but we're all adults now,
we can move on from that.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.166
Well, good.

45:04.335 --> 45:05.501
I guess you and Elizabeth

45:05.570 --> 45:06.669
have found that thing

45:06.705 --> 45:07.937
that Grandma Vivien
always talks about--

45:08.006 --> 45:09.072
you know...

45:09.140 --> 45:10.039
that "zing".

45:13.244 --> 45:15.078
Grandma was talking about
what she had with Grandpa Lou.

45:16.614 --> 45:18.614
I don't got a zing with Lizzie.
I got a zing with nobody.

45:18.650 --> 45:19.716
I'm zing-less.

45:19.751 --> 45:20.683
Come on.

45:22.153 --> 45:23.286
George and Lizzie...

45:23.321 --> 45:24.320
they got a zing.

45:26.458 --> 45:27.824
Those two are perfect
for each other.

45:29.594 --> 45:30.660

51:28.486 --> 51:29.985

is ridiculous?

51:30.054 --> 51:32.188
The fact that you have a list

51:32.223 --> 51:33.856
that you're using
to make another list

51:33.891 --> 51:35.458

can buy you presents,

51:35.493 --> 51:37.059

of their hearts,

51:37.095 --> 51:38.727

on those two lists.

that when you were a kid,

you were the one

52:22.373 --> 52:24.840
who would find the joy

all those unicorns on it.

No idea.

52:49.300 --> 52:50.232
Hmm.

52:51.469 --> 52:53.035
But that was
a really long time ago.

52:54.505 --> 52:57.072

56:03.894 --> 56:04.860
[Joey] I just assumed.

56:04.895 --> 56:06.128
Well, anyways,

56:06.163 --> 56:09.264
what do you think of this
for your first dance?

56:11.469 --> 56:12.301
["How Do I Live?"
by LeAnn Rimes playing]

56:12.336 --> 56:13.302
[dog barking]

56:15.573 --> 56:17.206
[mom] Joey!
The dog needs to go out!

56:17.241 --> 56:18.440
[Joey] Sorry.

56:18.476 --> 56:19.608
I'll be right back.

56:22.446 --> 56:25.114
[¶¶¶]

56:25.149 --> 56:28.183
¶ How do I... ¶

56:28.219 --> 56:31.453
¶ Get through a night
without you... ¶

56:31.489 --> 56:32.588
[laughing]

56:32.623 --> 56:34.523
DJ Joey.

56:34.558 --> 56:36.992
Oh...

56:37.027 --> 56:39.928
I must have left my list
at the house.

56:39.964 --> 56:42.030
We should probably head back.

56:43.534 --> 56:45.567
Well, hold on.

56:45.603 --> 56:49.238
DJ Joey put on
a heck of a presentation here.

56:49.273 --> 56:50.773
I think this song
is pretty nice.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.074
You want to take it for a spin?
See if you like it?

56:54.245 --> 56:55.711
-Fine.
-Alright.

56:55.780 --> 57:03.619
¶ Baby, you would take away
everything good in my heart ¶

57:03.654 --> 57:05.421
Oh, my goodness,
what is happening down here?

57:06.924 --> 57:08.323
I know how to dance, David.

57:08.359 --> 57:09.491
Of course.

57:09.527 --> 57:10.959
Just thinking
maybe one of us should lead.

57:13.063 --> 57:14.029
Okay...

57:14.064 --> 57:14.963
show me then.

57:16.467 --> 57:17.399
Alright. Hand, hand.

57:18.669 --> 57:19.401
Shoulder.
You had it before.

57:21.038 --> 57:22.137
Bear with me.

57:22.173 --> 57:24.540
Step. Step.

57:24.575 --> 57:25.808
There it is. Easy.

57:28.279 --> 57:29.578
Listen to the music.

57:31.248 --> 57:32.347
See how you feel.

57:32.383 --> 57:35.818
¶ I'd be lost if I lost you ¶

57:35.853 --> 57:39.188
¶ If you ever leave... ¶

57:39.223 --> 57:40.923
[David] There...

57:40.958 --> 57:45.427
¶ Baby, you would take away
everything real in my life... ¶

57:45.463 --> 57:47.095
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

57:47.131 --> 57:48.130
You sure?

57:48.199 --> 57:49.998
You want to go slower?

57:50.034 --> 57:50.966
Let's go slower.

57:51.001 --> 57:52.034
Alright.

57:52.102 --> 57:56.572
¶ How do I live
without you... ¶

57:56.640 --> 57:59.408
-[door opens]
-[Joey] Sorry about that.

57:59.443 --> 58:01.009
[door closes]

58:01.045 --> 58:02.478
What do we think of the song?

58:02.513 --> 58:03.846
Well, DJ Joey,

58:03.881 --> 58:05.180
I think the song is...

58:06.550 --> 58:07.449
I think it's perfect
for the bride and groom.

58:09.253 --> 58:10.052
What do you think, Elizabeth?

58:12.556 --> 58:13.889
Yeah...

58:13.924 --> 58:18.327
I... I...

58:18.395 --> 58:20.229
I think I will just meet you
back at the house.

58:24.101 --> 58:26.502
Uh, I'm gonna need
a 50% deposit up front.

58:26.537 --> 58:27.903
Not the time, Joe.

58:30.274 --> 58:31.473
-I'm gonna call you later.
-Okay.

58:33.544 --> 58:34.710
And then he says,

58:34.778 --> 58:37.212
"Sure. I'll watch
your dating show with you."

58:37.248 --> 58:39.681
Because, apparently,
he knows all about romance.

58:39.717 --> 58:41.016
But trust me,

58:41.051 --> 58:43.252
I don't need David Belling
telling me about romance.

58:44.722 --> 58:46.455
Are you gonna order
a platter soon,

58:46.490 --> 58:48.490
because I'm supposed
to take my break.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.292
Yeah. Sure.

58:50.361 --> 58:51.660
But what I really want is pie.

58:51.695 --> 58:53.662
Great.
One platter coming up.

58:55.566 --> 58:57.866
I had my whole life
figured out.

58:57.902 --> 58:59.301
Everything was written down
on lists.

59:00.838 --> 59:02.905
But today, I lost my list.

59:06.677 --> 59:07.743
No oysters?

59:07.778 --> 59:09.344
Well, it kind of seemed like

59:09.380 --> 59:10.546
you could use
a piece of pie today.

59:10.581 --> 59:11.847
Thank you.

59:11.882 --> 59:12.915
You're welcome.

59:12.950 --> 59:14.750
Don't worry.

59:14.785 --> 59:16.418
It's just pre-wedding jitters.

59:16.487 --> 59:17.553
I'm gonna marry George.

59:18.689 --> 59:19.755
Truth is, I didn't even know

59:19.790 --> 59:20.856
you could go weak
in the knees until...

59:22.693 --> 59:23.559
Until George?

59:29.300 --> 59:31.767
Okay, I'm gonna go
take my break.

59:31.802 --> 59:33.135
Enjoy that pie.

59:34.371 --> 59:36.171
[bell clanging]

59:36.206 --> 59:37.573
[cheering]

59:44.381 --> 59:47.683
[¶¶¶]

59:49.653 --> 59:51.587
Oh, where do you
want this, Louise?

59:51.622 --> 59:52.921
Just with me is fine.

59:52.957 --> 59:54.022
Thanks.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.626
Oh, hey, Eugene.

59:57.661 --> 59:59.761
Um...

59:59.797 --> 1:00:00.829
thanks for helping me.

1:00:00.864 --> 1:00:01.763
My pleasure.

1:00:11.942 --> 1:00:15.811
[¶¶¶]

1:00:22.953 --> 1:00:23.885
Oh!

1:00:28.258 --> 1:00:29.625
Oh!

1:00:32.997 --> 1:00:34.763
Don't give up now.
You've almost got it.

1:00:36.233 --> 1:00:38.066
I thought I was alone.

1:00:38.102 --> 1:00:39.868
Yeah, and I thought
we were doing wedding stuff.

1:00:41.338 --> 1:00:42.304
May I make a suggestion?

1:00:42.339 --> 1:00:43.305
-No.
-Okay.

1:00:50.748 --> 1:00:51.580
[Elizabeth moans]

1:00:56.754 --> 1:00:57.653
You okay?

1:01:00.557 --> 1:01:01.690
Fine.

1:01:01.725 --> 1:01:02.891
I can't do it
while you're looking at me.

1:01:02.926 --> 1:01:04.226
Of course.
Yes, ma'am.

1:01:10.134 --> 1:01:11.133
[Elizabeth]
You know, I've been thinking.

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:11.867
[David] What have you
been thinking?

1:01:13.604 --> 1:01:15.671
Just everything that's happened
since the bridge went down.

1:01:19.243 --> 1:01:20.409
For as long as I can remember,

1:01:20.444 --> 1:01:23.011
every aspect of my life
has been planned.

1:01:23.047 --> 1:01:24.579
Get good grades.

1:01:24.615 --> 1:01:25.547
Go to college.

1:01:25.582 --> 1:01:27.182
Go to dental school.

1:01:27.217 --> 1:01:28.383
Marry George.

1:01:28.419 --> 1:01:29.651
Run my dental practice.

1:01:30.688 --> 1:01:32.421
It's all written down.

1:01:32.456 --> 1:01:33.855
What's wrong with that?

1:01:33.891 --> 1:01:35.857
I've just been thinking
about that list you showed me--

1:01:35.893 --> 1:01:37.826
in the book.

1:01:37.895 --> 1:01:39.127
All the places
I wanted to see in Rome.

1:01:40.664 --> 1:01:42.097
And I found myself wondering,

1:01:42.132 --> 1:01:44.566
why haven't I been
to any of those places?

1:01:45.836 --> 1:01:48.537
All George and I ever do
is just work all day

1:01:48.605 --> 1:01:50.439
and go to conferences
on weekends,

1:01:50.474 --> 1:01:51.907
and, and, and...

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:55.844
And I know that for you,
a trip is just a small thing,

1:01:55.913 --> 1:01:56.945
but--

1:01:56.980 --> 1:01:58.613
Small things
are the big things,

1:01:58.682 --> 1:01:59.881
and good things only happen

1:01:59.917 --> 1:02:01.083
from all the hundreds

1:02:01.118 --> 1:02:02.117
of tiny steps
you take along the way.

1:02:03.687 --> 1:02:05.153
I need to start taking
those tiny steps.

1:02:08.592 --> 1:02:09.858
With George.

1:02:11.495 --> 1:02:12.360
Sure.

1:02:13.864 --> 1:02:16.031
We need to take some time away
from the practice,

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:17.199
and...

1:02:17.234 --> 1:02:18.333
go to Rome.

1:02:21.438 --> 1:02:23.505
You can picture George
at the Colosseum, right?

1:02:24.641 --> 1:02:25.607
Of course.

1:02:25.642 --> 1:02:26.475
I can picture that.

1:02:28.112 --> 1:02:29.044
Great!

1:02:30.681 --> 1:02:32.514
That's what
I'm going to do, then.

1:02:32.583 --> 1:02:33.915
As soon as George gets here,

1:02:33.951 --> 1:02:35.984
I'm going to tell him
about our new plan.

1:02:36.019 --> 1:02:37.052
Alright.

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:40.088
But first I'm going
to climb this ladder.

1:02:40.124 --> 1:02:41.356
Right.

1:02:51.301 --> 1:02:52.801
Take your time.

1:02:52.870 --> 1:02:55.570
You got it.
Stay close.

1:03:02.179 --> 1:03:03.178
You got it.

1:03:03.213 --> 1:03:04.746
A little further.

1:03:04.782 --> 1:03:05.680
[Elizabeth] Oh, my goodness.

1:03:05.716 --> 1:03:06.815
Pull yourself over.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:12.587
[¶¶¶]

1:03:16.193 --> 1:03:17.092
How's the view?

1:03:21.799 --> 1:03:22.964
Amazing.

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.269
[¶¶¶]

1:03:33.310 --> 1:03:34.242
-Oh!
-Oh!

1:03:34.278 --> 1:03:35.243
Dr. Belling.

1:03:35.279 --> 1:03:37.078
Denise.

1:03:38.182 --> 1:03:39.481
Your sister called.

1:03:39.516 --> 1:03:40.982
The Echo Island Bridge
is reopening tomorrow.

1:03:41.018 --> 1:03:42.551
Oh! That's good news.

1:03:42.586 --> 1:03:43.852
Yeah.

1:03:44.988 --> 1:03:45.954
Thank you, Denise.

1:03:45.989 --> 1:03:47.422
For what?

1:03:47.457 --> 1:03:49.591
Thank you for always
putting in extra hours,

1:03:49.626 --> 1:03:50.592
even when not asked.

1:03:50.661 --> 1:03:52.761
Oh, well, it's my pleasure.

1:03:52.796 --> 1:03:53.829
Well, I imagine

1:03:53.897 --> 1:03:54.729
there's probably
a thousand other places

1:03:54.765 --> 1:03:55.864
you'd rather be than here.

1:03:55.899 --> 1:03:57.465
Not really.

1:03:57.501 --> 1:03:59.267
I really enjoy my job,

1:03:59.303 --> 1:04:02.971
so, truthfully,
there's no place I'd rather be.

1:04:07.611 --> 1:04:08.510
Uh-huh.

1:04:16.787 --> 1:04:19.521
So what is the sheriff doing?

1:04:19.556 --> 1:04:21.089
He's trying to catch
the bad guys.

1:04:21.158 --> 1:04:22.891
Spoiler, he always does.

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:24.125
Hmm, clever.

1:04:25.863 --> 1:04:26.761
You don't like this movie,
do you?

1:04:26.830 --> 1:04:27.863
Shh.

1:04:27.898 --> 1:04:29.097
You can admit it.

1:04:30.434 --> 1:04:31.466
Hey.

1:04:31.535 --> 1:04:32.534
I spoke to Bob Dooley today.

1:04:32.569 --> 1:04:34.636
[together] Uh-huh?

1:04:34.671 --> 1:04:35.937
And the bridge
is reopening in the morning.

1:04:35.973 --> 1:04:37.772
[together] Mm-hmm.

1:04:37.808 --> 1:04:39.507
So George'll be back soon.

1:04:41.044 --> 1:04:42.811
[power cutting out]

1:04:42.846 --> 1:04:44.079
[David] Nice.

1:04:48.318 --> 1:04:51.119
So will you be leaving
once the bridge reopens?

1:04:51.188 --> 1:04:52.554
[David] No, no, no.

1:04:52.589 --> 1:04:54.623
I've gotta stay for
the engagement party, right?

1:04:58.061 --> 1:05:00.462
Alright, I've told her to change
this thing a million times, Mom.

1:05:00.497 --> 1:05:04.332
Wow, look at all these boxes.

1:05:05.669 --> 1:05:08.236
Geez Louise, Louise,
that's a lot of them.

1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:11.373
Here's one of yours.

1:05:15.746 --> 1:05:16.678
What's in here?

1:05:22.085 --> 1:05:27.689
Oh, that is a lot of souvenirs
and travel books.

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:30.492
Can I see that book, please?

1:05:30.527 --> 1:05:31.760
Sure.

1:05:31.795 --> 1:05:33.161
Thank you.

1:05:35.065 --> 1:05:36.531
So have you really been
to all these places?

1:05:39.169 --> 1:05:41.369
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

1:05:41.405 --> 1:05:43.371
London, Amsterdam...

1:05:46.576 --> 1:05:48.543
Paris.

1:05:48.578 --> 1:05:49.477
After you and George
go to Rome,

1:05:49.513 --> 1:05:50.745
you've gotta stop in Paris.

1:05:50.781 --> 1:05:51.947
Everybody's gotta see
Paris once.

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:55.216
Walk along the Seine River.

1:05:55.285 --> 1:05:57.319
Wander the streets of Monmarte.

1:05:57.354 --> 1:05:59.387
You've gotta stop
at this little place

1:05:59.423 --> 1:06:00.822
in the 5th arrondissement

1:06:00.857 --> 1:06:03.825
that has the best profiteroles
that you will ever have.

1:06:03.894 --> 1:06:05.126
They just melt in your mouth.

1:06:05.195 --> 1:06:09.431
What if George doesn't want
to go to Paris?

1:06:09.466 --> 1:06:11.266
I mean, Lizzie, you talk
a lot about George's plan

1:06:11.301 --> 1:06:12.167
and what he wants,

1:06:12.202 --> 1:06:13.635
but...

1:06:13.670 --> 1:06:15.303
I know George would want to do
what you want to do, too.

1:06:17.307 --> 1:06:18.173
So what do you want?

1:06:21.778 --> 1:06:22.744
I want to go to Paris.

1:06:23.914 --> 1:06:24.980
Then you should go to Paris.

1:06:27.250 --> 1:06:28.116
What will people think?

1:06:29.419 --> 1:06:30.719
Lizzie, sometimes,
the people around you

1:06:30.754 --> 1:06:31.953
aren't going
to understand your journey.

1:06:33.123 --> 1:06:34.589
That's okay.
They don't need to.

1:06:36.126 --> 1:06:37.258
It's not for them.

1:06:39.429 --> 1:06:41.229
Lizzie, maybe nobody's
told you this before,

1:06:41.264 --> 1:06:43.765
but it's okay...

1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:45.867
for you to chase
your own happiness.

1:06:52.476 --> 1:06:53.708
[power surges on]

1:06:57.147 --> 1:06:58.146
<i> Et voilà.</i>

1:07:03.887 --> 1:07:04.819
<i> Bonne nuit.</i>

1:07:04.855 --> 1:07:06.254
Goodnight.

1:07:19.069 --> 1:07:22.370

1:07:31.481 --> 1:07:35.917
[¶¶¶]

1:07:49.599 --> 1:07:50.465
[George] Elizabeth!

1:07:50.534 --> 1:07:51.900
George.

1:07:51.935 --> 1:07:52.834
You're back!

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:57.672
Are you alright?

1:07:57.707 --> 1:07:59.374
Yes. Yes.

1:07:59.409 --> 1:08:00.308
I was just about
to go for a walk.

1:08:00.343 --> 1:08:01.176
Do you want to join me?

1:08:01.244 --> 1:08:02.143
Sure.

1:08:04.014 --> 1:08:05.680
Oh, I hope you don't mind,

1:08:05.715 --> 1:08:08.616
I registered us for a seminar
in September at the University.

1:08:08.652 --> 1:08:11.052
Fixed metallic replacements
versus dental implants.

1:08:11.088 --> 1:08:12.821
I couldn't resist.

1:08:12.856 --> 1:08:14.122
It sounded so fun.

1:08:14.157 --> 1:08:15.123
Yeah, sure, George.
Whatever you want.

1:08:18.829 --> 1:08:21.296
Actually...

1:08:21.364 --> 1:08:22.430
while you were gone,
I did some thinking,

1:08:22.499 --> 1:08:23.865
and, um...

1:08:23.900 --> 1:08:26.568
I think I've come up
with a pretty fun plan for us.

1:08:26.603 --> 1:08:28.336
Another seminar?

1:08:28.371 --> 1:08:29.404
Not exactly.

1:08:30.841 --> 1:08:32.340
I think that we should
put things on hold

1:08:32.409 --> 1:08:33.775
for a couple of months

1:08:33.810 --> 1:08:35.477
and travel the world.

1:08:36.847 --> 1:08:38.480
Elizabeth, I already said

1:08:38.515 --> 1:08:40.081
I do not want
to go to South America.

1:08:40.117 --> 1:08:43.918
I have no interest
in ziplining across the Andes.

1:08:43.954 --> 1:08:44.819
And this is certainly
not the time

1:08:44.888 --> 1:08:46.087
to leave our practice.

1:08:46.123 --> 1:08:47.689
Okay, just hear me out, George.

1:08:48.892 --> 1:08:50.592
This could actually be

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:52.193
the perfect time for us
to do something like this.

1:08:53.530 --> 1:08:54.696
We don't have kids,

1:08:54.731 --> 1:08:56.998
we haven't bought a house yet.

1:08:57.067 --> 1:08:58.399
It could be
the adventure of a lifetime.

1:09:00.003 --> 1:09:01.436
And we don't have to go
to South America.

1:09:01.471 --> 1:09:02.504
We could...

1:09:02.539 --> 1:09:03.938
We could go to Rome.

1:09:05.208 --> 1:09:06.474
Did I ever tell you

1:09:06.510 --> 1:09:08.309
how much I've always wanted
to see the Coliseum?

1:09:09.646 --> 1:09:13.214
And then we could go to Paris
and eat profiteroles.

1:09:13.250 --> 1:09:15.116
Do I need to remind you

1:09:15.152 --> 1:09:16.784
that this fall
we have a dental convention,

1:09:16.820 --> 1:09:18.253
three seminars, two lectures,

1:09:18.321 --> 1:09:19.988
and not to mention our patients,

1:09:20.023 --> 1:09:20.955
who, I assure you,

1:09:20.991 --> 1:09:22.457
will not be very happy

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:24.058
to know that their dentists
are galavanting across Europe.

1:09:24.094 --> 1:09:25.793
Sure. Sure.

1:09:25.829 --> 1:09:26.761
You're right.

1:09:27.964 --> 1:09:28.830
Just a crazy idea.

1:09:32.202 --> 1:09:33.134
Maybe someday we can go?

1:09:33.170 --> 1:09:36.337
Maybe someday,

1:09:36.373 --> 1:09:39.340
when we're very old
and very grey,

1:09:39.376 --> 1:09:40.275
we'll go to Paris.

1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:44.312
Dance with me.

1:09:44.347 --> 1:09:45.213
What?

1:09:45.282 --> 1:09:46.681
I want to dance with you.

1:09:46.716 --> 1:09:47.582
Now?

1:09:47.617 --> 1:09:50.518
Yes. Now.

1:09:53.089 --> 1:09:55.223
Dance? Huh.

1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:59.661
["How Do I Live?"

1:10:08.905 --> 1:10:10.672
¶ How do I... ¶

1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:11.773
Are you sure you're alright?

1:10:11.808 --> 1:10:13.575
Yes.

1:10:13.610 --> 1:10:14.709
Just dance with me.

1:10:16.379 --> 1:10:20.248
¶ If I had to live

¶ Oh, I... ¶

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:28.156
George?

1:10:28.191 --> 1:10:30.658
Do you think you could
hold me a bit closer?

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:32.227
Mm-hmm.

1:10:32.262 --> 1:10:35.196

1:10:48.979 --> 1:10:50.578
Are we done yet?

1:10:54.084 --> 1:10:55.783
Yes, George.

1:10:55.819 --> 1:10:56.718
We're done.

1:11:02.459 --> 1:11:06.494
[¶¶¶]

1:11:07.831 --> 1:11:09.097
When I was a young girl,

1:11:09.132 --> 1:11:11.466
there was no such thing
as an engagement party.

1:11:11.501 --> 1:11:13.568
Back then, we just got married.

1:11:13.603 --> 1:11:14.802
No celebration.

1:11:14.871 --> 1:11:16.537
Gran, that can't be true.

1:11:16.573 --> 1:11:18.139
It's true.

1:11:18.174 --> 1:11:19.641
Lou and I were married
in my mother's kitchen.

1:11:19.676 --> 1:11:22.677
There was no food,
there was no music,

1:11:22.712 --> 1:11:23.978
no fancy party.

1:11:24.014 --> 1:11:25.313
No presents.

1:11:25.348 --> 1:11:26.948
Oh, Mother, please.

1:11:27.017 --> 1:11:28.416
No, there must have been
some presents.

1:11:28.485 --> 1:11:29.984
No.

1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:32.887
My father gave us $5.00
and wished us good luck.

1:11:35.692 --> 1:11:37.725
I was married 57 years.

1:11:37.761 --> 1:11:38.726
What does that tell you?

1:11:38.762 --> 1:11:40.194
I'm not totally sure.

1:11:41.331 --> 1:11:42.664
If you ask me,

1:11:42.699 --> 1:11:43.998
the shorter the engagement,

1:11:44.067 --> 1:11:45.199
the longer the marriage.

1:11:47.904 --> 1:11:48.803
How long have you been engaged?

1:11:48.838 --> 1:11:50.405
Meatballs, Grandma?

1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:52.373
Oh! I thought you'd never ask.

1:11:54.544 --> 1:11:55.810
Elizabeth, would you like
to go and dance?

1:11:58.214 --> 1:11:59.847
Yeah? Georgie?

1:11:59.883 --> 1:12:02.617
Oh, no, thank you, David.

1:12:02.652 --> 1:12:04.886
Alright, brother.

1:12:04.921 --> 1:12:06.087
Let's go!

1:12:08.291 --> 1:12:09.557

1:12:09.592 --> 1:12:10.458

1:12:10.527 --> 1:12:12.093
Hi.

1:12:12.162 --> 1:12:13.328
Thanks again
for the invitation.

1:12:13.363 --> 1:12:14.796
This place is amazing!

1:12:14.831 --> 1:12:16.364
Good. I hope
you're having a good time.

1:12:16.399 --> 1:12:17.665
And who's this?

1:12:17.701 --> 1:12:18.900
David Belling.

1:12:18.968 --> 1:12:19.834
Abby.

1:12:19.869 --> 1:12:20.968
Abby, nice to meet you.

1:12:22.238 --> 1:12:23.237
Excuse me one moment.
I'm going to put this down.

1:12:23.273 --> 1:12:24.906
So this is David?

1:12:28.478 --> 1:12:29.344
I guess she's going.

1:12:33.616 --> 1:12:34.916
Let's go!

1:12:36.019 --> 1:12:36.851
Come on.

1:12:38.221 --> 1:12:39.153
There it is.

1:12:39.189 --> 1:12:40.588
My goodness, there it is.

1:12:40.623 --> 1:12:42.156
I learned from the best.

1:12:42.192 --> 1:12:43.891
Don't you flatter me.

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:45.093
[upbeat music
changes to a slow song]

1:12:45.128 --> 1:12:48.730
¶ You are so beautiful... ¶

1:12:48.765 --> 1:12:50.331
This seems
to happen to us a lot.

1:12:51.968 --> 1:12:53.534
Yeah.

1:12:53.570 --> 1:12:55.536
[¶¶¶]

¶ You are... ¶

1:13:02.011 --> 1:13:04.245
You alright?

1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:06.681
Yeah.

1:13:06.716 --> 1:13:08.216
I'm okay.

1:13:08.251 --> 1:13:10.251
I don't know what that was.
I'm sorry.

1:13:11.254 --> 1:13:12.854
Zing.

1:13:12.889 --> 1:13:15.123
[¶¶¶]

1:13:15.158 --> 1:13:16.424
Hello, everyone.

1:13:16.459 --> 1:13:18.693
If you would all
head inside the house,

1:13:18.728 --> 1:13:21.362
we have a wonderful
selection of desserts.

1:13:21.398 --> 1:13:22.497
Come on in.

1:13:22.532 --> 1:13:24.432
¶ ...You're everything
I hoped for ¶

1:13:24.467 --> 1:13:27.535
[¶¶¶]

1:13:27.604 --> 1:13:31.072
¶ You're everything I need... ¶

1:13:31.107 --> 1:13:33.808
[¶¶¶]

1:13:33.843 --> 1:13:35.443
Shall we?

1:13:35.478 --> 1:13:36.644
Mm-hmm.

1:13:36.713 --> 1:13:39.347
¶ You are so beautiful... ¶

1:13:41.084 --> 1:13:42.450
And I say,

1:13:42.485 --> 1:13:44.085
"Because we need to check
for cavities and gum disease."

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:45.820
And then she says,

1:13:45.855 --> 1:13:47.455
"Do I get a refund
if you don't find any?"

1:13:47.490 --> 1:13:48.389
[laughing]

1:13:50.427 --> 1:13:51.626
Excuse me.

1:13:51.661 --> 1:13:52.794
George, may I speak with you
for a moment?

1:13:52.829 --> 1:13:53.661
Uh, sure.

1:13:54.798 --> 1:13:55.763
Excuse me for a minute.

1:14:06.476 --> 1:14:08.042
George...

1:14:08.077 --> 1:14:10.545
I was hoping we could talk about
the past few days.

1:14:10.613 --> 1:14:11.913
What about the past few days?

1:14:13.616 --> 1:14:15.383
[man] Hey, Georgie boy!

1:14:15.418 --> 1:14:16.617
How do I explain?

1:14:19.956 --> 1:14:21.522
Once upon a time,

1:14:21.558 --> 1:14:25.226
there was a lonely, little girl,
who came from a broken family.

1:14:26.463 --> 1:14:27.995
And one day,

1:14:28.031 --> 1:14:31.098
this wonderful family
moved in across the street.

1:14:32.435 --> 1:14:37.972
And they were fun
and loving and kind.

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:40.208
And they welcomed her
with open arms.

1:14:42.011 --> 1:14:43.311
And since then,

1:14:43.346 --> 1:14:47.482
she's been trying to replicate
this perfect family.

1:14:48.618 --> 1:14:50.952
This perfect life.

1:14:52.922 --> 1:14:54.288
What are you trying to say?

1:14:58.495 --> 1:15:00.394
I've had this one goal...

1:15:01.998 --> 1:15:04.198
and this one plan
for how to get there.

1:15:05.969 --> 1:15:07.301
But I've discovered

1:15:07.337 --> 1:15:09.770
that sometimes life takes us
to unexpected places.

1:15:12.342 --> 1:15:17.111
And that maybe
having a plan for happiness

1:15:17.146 --> 1:15:20.147
isn't the same
as just being happy.

1:15:21.918 --> 1:15:24.085
Well, I need to have
a plan, Elizabeth.

1:15:24.153 --> 1:15:25.119
I know you do, George.

1:15:26.489 --> 1:15:27.922
And that's great.
It is.

1:15:29.392 --> 1:15:30.291
I used to be that way, too.

1:15:30.326 --> 1:15:31.592
Used to?

1:15:33.730 --> 1:15:36.464
Ever since the bridge went down,

1:15:36.499 --> 1:15:38.199
I've realized that...

1:15:38.268 --> 1:15:41.936
I need to find out
who I really am...

1:15:42.005 --> 1:15:46.107
and what actually
makes me happy...

1:15:46.142 --> 1:15:47.508
without a plan.

1:15:49.212 --> 1:15:50.278
I see.

1:15:52.215 --> 1:15:53.414
And where does that leave us?

1:15:56.052 --> 1:16:00.655
[¶¶¶]

1:16:09.966 --> 1:16:11.599
Is there anything I can say
to change your mind?

1:16:15.204 --> 1:16:16.170
Hmm.

1:16:16.239 --> 1:16:18.039
Well...

1:16:18.074 --> 1:16:20.474
I guess that's the point.

1:16:20.510 --> 1:16:22.410
If I have to convince you,
then there is no point.

1:16:39.062 --> 1:16:40.461
George. Wait.

1:16:43.099 --> 1:16:45.032
Thank you for making
every day we had together

1:16:45.068 --> 1:16:46.968
so perfect.

[¶¶¶]

1:17:02.485 --> 1:17:03.718
[Louise] Have you seen David?

1:17:03.786 --> 1:17:04.785
He's gone.

1:17:04.821 --> 1:17:06.454
Gone? Gone for good?

1:17:06.489 --> 1:17:07.722
You know David.

1:17:07.757 --> 1:17:10.791
There's always another adventure
on the horizon.

1:17:10.827 --> 1:17:12.293

Louise and Eugene!

Who knew dental hygienists
had those kind of moves?

1:19:06.909 --> 1:19:08.642
Did you see
that she caught the bouquet?

1:19:10.246 --> 1:19:11.979
Doesn't look like
she's letting go anytime soon.

She seems so happy.

1:19:28.364 --> 1:19:29.730
Yeah.

1:19:29.799 --> 1:19:32.066
I think she found
a really good man.

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:32.967
I think so, too.

1:19:39.575 --> 1:19:40.841
You know,
I wanted to write to you.

1:19:43.146 --> 1:19:45.579
Just didn't know
where to send the postcards.

1:20:22.118 --> 1:20:23.617
I tried writing you, too.

1:20:28.391 --> 1:20:29.757
Just a very long time ago.

1:20:33.496 --> 1:20:34.628

Sistine Chapel.

1:20:48.678 --> 1:20:49.977
I don't know
where any of these places are,

1:20:50.012 --> 1:20:50.878
but if you wanna go,

1:20:50.947 --> 1:20:52.179
I wanna go.

1:20:54.417 --> 1:20:55.716
But only with you.

1:20:56.986 --> 1:20:58.319
Love, David."

1:21:01.057 --> 1:21:02.556
I was 13 years old
when I wrote that note.

1:21:05.795 --> 1:21:07.261
It was right after I read yours.

1:21:08.664 --> 1:21:11.165
I put it in that book
right there,

1:21:11.234 --> 1:21:12.867
hoping that one day
maybe you would find it.

1:21:15.538 --> 1:21:17.137
But you never did.

1:21:19.375 --> 1:21:20.908
Not the smartest idea
of all time, but...

1:21:22.645 --> 1:21:23.577
it was okay...

1:21:26.315 --> 1:21:27.214
because you were happy.

1:21:29.752 --> 1:21:32.686
You asked me once
if I'd ever been in love.

1:21:35.658 --> 1:21:36.924
The answer is, just once.

1:21:39.562 --> 1:21:40.928
And I never stopped.

1:21:42.899 --> 1:21:44.198
For me, it's always been you.

1:21:47.737 --> 1:21:51.105
I loved you yesterday,

1:21:51.140 --> 1:21:52.773
I love you today...

1:21:53.976 --> 1:21:55.209
I'll love you tomorrow.

1:22:22.872 --> 1:22:26.073
I thought I might get a kiss
with that line.

He's going to propose.

1:23:00.843 --> 1:23:02.009
Just watch.

1:23:03.946 --> 1:23:05.512
I thought you didn't like
these dating shows.

1:23:05.548 --> 1:23:07.514
Well, you know...
