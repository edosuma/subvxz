WEBVTT

00:04.626 --> 00:06.058
Maybe if we...

00:07.483 --> 00:08.284
No.

00:09.256 --> 00:09.971
No.

00:14.316 --> 00:16.172
<i>Why don't we bring
the Wraith in on this?</i>

00:16.293 --> 00:17.095
No.

00:17.836 --> 00:21.670
<i>A lot of this new nanite coding is based
on his calculations, so maybe...</i>

00:21.790 --> 00:25.832
(A) he wouldn't help us,
(B) we don't need his help and (C)...

00:26.239 --> 00:27.747
someone get me some coffee.

00:28.515 --> 00:30.574
<i>You've been silently
staring at that board</i>

00:30.995 --> 00:32.267
for three hours.

00:32.387 --> 00:35.537
- Yeah. It'll come to me.
- Just e-mail her, already.

00:39.459 --> 00:40.465
Excuse me?

00:40.797 --> 00:42.044
<i>Rodney, we're stuck.</i>

00:42.284 --> 00:44.281
We've been stuck for ten hours.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.691
Just ask her for help, please.

00:47.105 --> 00:49.384
- I'm not stuck.
- Last time we had a block like this,

00:49.504 --> 00:51.294
- she helped us.
- Completely different.

00:51.414 --> 00:53.662
I cannot sit here waiting
for you to have an epiphany!

00:53.782 --> 00:55.557
I'm losing the will to live!

00:58.546 --> 01:01.099
I suppose there could be more
important things I should be working on.

01:01.219 --> 01:03.315

to sell it to yourself, that's fine.

- Done!</i>

01:16.678 --> 01:18.624
- Just one big cookie?
- Yeah.

01:18.744 --> 01:20.267
Don't you wanna use your cutters?

01:20.387 --> 01:22.010
Nah. I just want a big one.

01:26.181 --> 01:28.633
You may wanna flatten
the dough a little bit.

01:30.494 --> 01:31.266
<i>No.</i>

01:31.386 --> 01:34.001
<i>No? Just a giant cookie mountain?
That's what you're going for?</i>

01:34.121 --> 01:34.922
<i>Okay!</i>

01:36.125 --> 01:38.481
- <i>Anything good?</i>
- It's from my brother.

01:39.846 --> 01:42.146
He's stuck again!
Do you mind if I...

01:42.936 --> 01:44.070
Yeah, I got this.

01:44.207 --> 01:46.009
- Here, do you wanna help with mine?
- OK.

01:46.129 --> 01:46.892
OK.

01:47.012 --> 01:48.879
I want a lot of flour.

01:49.783 --> 01:52.170
<i>- How about some more chocolate chips?
- But not the full bowl.</i>

01:52.290 --> 01:53.968
<i>No, that would be too many.</i>

02:05.887 --> 02:07.140
You can't sleep?

02:07.843 --> 02:09.394
I thought I heard something.

02:09.514 --> 02:10.519
Madison?

02:11.653 --> 02:12.676
I don't know.

02:14.084 --> 02:15.709
I'm going to check it out.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.522
She probably just snuck
downstairs for more cookies.

02:18.642 --> 02:20.309
That's actually not a bad idea.

02:21.754 --> 02:22.637
Drop!

03:42.323 --> 03:43.260
Gentlemen.

03:43.844 --> 03:46.876
I'm agent Barrett. I work for the NID.
Mr. Woolsey has asked me

03:46.996 --> 03:50.142
to help you in any way I can. Sorry we
didn't meet under better circumstances.

03:50.262 --> 03:51.982
Have the kidnappers tried to contact us?

03:52.102 --> 03:54.111
- No, I'm afraid not.
- I need to get to Vancouver.

03:54.231 --> 03:56.585
Okay, the Daedalus is in orbit,
so it will be a quick trip.

03:56.705 --> 03:58.596
Have you learned any
new information yet?

03:58.716 --> 04:01.702
No, not yet. The NID is liaising
with CSIS on the ground.

04:01.822 --> 04:03.662
- They are expecting us.
- "C" what, now?

04:03.859 --> 04:05.566
Canadian Security Intelligence Services.

04:05.686 --> 04:07.269
They're kind of like our CIA.

04:07.689 --> 04:08.498
"CSIS"?

04:08.838 --> 04:10.869
That the best you guys can do, huh?

04:11.582 --> 04:13.314
We will be out in the open, so...

04:14.019 --> 04:16.129
Perhaps a change of clothes first?

04:17.627 --> 04:18.435
What?

04:31.408 --> 04:32.433
I look dumb.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.016
It helps you blend in a little.

04:35.136 --> 04:37.379
I'm going to stand out
no matter what you dress me in.

04:37.499 --> 04:38.907
That's a good point.

04:51.310 --> 04:53.094
Hey, look. It's your uncle Mer.

04:53.457 --> 04:54.454
Hey, lady.

04:55.005 --> 04:56.378
You going to say hi?

04:56.820 --> 04:57.852
Where's mom?

04:58.898 --> 05:00.269
Uh, she's...

05:00.389 --> 05:02.289
I told you. She's had
to go away for a bit,

05:02.409 --> 05:04.506
but she's going to come back soon, okay?

05:05.267 --> 05:06.270
Can I...

05:06.483 --> 05:07.284
Yeah.

05:07.848 --> 05:09.014
Okay, sweetie.

05:14.144 --> 05:16.227
- Who did this?
- We're not sure, but we have

05:16.347 --> 05:18.693
the best people working
on this, and all the resources of...

05:18.813 --> 05:22.589
When you came back last year, she almost
didn't go back with you to Atlantis.

05:22.983 --> 05:25.177
I said, "Go, you have to do it.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.205
- You'll regret not going."
- I know you did.

05:27.325 --> 05:29.623
She knew it'd be dangerous,
but you two are so competive...

05:29.785 --> 05:32.167
- Listen to me. We're going to...
- This is your fault,

05:32.329 --> 05:34.657
- Hey, just a second.
- She got kidnapped because of you.

05:34.777 --> 05:36.964
- We do not know that for sure.
- <i>We don't?</i>

05:37.646 --> 05:40.408
Really? You figure four masked men
with guns broke in here

05:40.528 --> 05:42.573
to steal her secret
apple dumpling recipe?

05:42.693 --> 05:44.500
- <i>Jealous neighbor, maybe?</i>
- You're angry.

05:44.620 --> 05:47.122
- You have every right to be...
- If something happens to her...

05:47.817 --> 05:48.620
<i>Kaleb.</i>

05:50.109 --> 05:51.478
We're going to find her.

05:53.795 --> 05:54.602
Just...

05:55.541 --> 05:57.316
Bring her back. Bring her home.

05:59.295 --> 06:00.332
I will.

06:03.661 --> 06:04.728
Come on, Mad.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.976
- Where are we going?
- Just away for a bit.

06:12.625 --> 06:13.968
I told him to get a hotel.

06:14.088 --> 06:16.205
There's no reason for them
to stick around here.

06:16.325 --> 06:18.718
All right, thanks, guys.
Give us the room, please.

06:26.281 --> 06:28.750
- <i>So, where do you want to start?</i>
- Jeanie and I were

06:28.870 --> 06:31.253
corresponding by email.
She was...

06:33.300 --> 06:35.770
- I was bouncing some ideas off her.
- What about?

06:35.890 --> 06:37.866
Well, before Sheppard's
Wraith showed up,

06:37.986 --> 06:40.273
I was trying to perfect
my nanite medical program.

06:40.393 --> 06:41.945
The thing you used to save Weir?

06:42.065 --> 06:45.157
Yeah, a better, more complex
version of that, but yeah.

06:45.897 --> 06:48.918
<i>Of course, as soon as we found out the
Replicators were attacking human worlds </i>

06:49.038 --> 06:52.784
in the galaxy, we switched our focus
to shutting them down once and for all.

06:53.335 --> 06:55.588
And you sent Jeanie the program
that you were working on?

06:55.708 --> 06:57.143
I need a new set of eyes.

06:57.517 --> 07:00.360
The question is, what does it
have to do with her being taken?

07:00.593 --> 07:03.592
Yeah. Maybe the Trust
or some other Earth-based organization

07:03.754 --> 07:06.522
<i>wanted info on me, or about
the Program, but regardless,</i>

07:06.642 --> 07:09.523
my email and her capture happened
too close together not to be connected.

07:09.643 --> 07:11.718
Right. That sounds like
a great place to start.

07:11.955 --> 07:14.887
- Has anyone touched her computer?
- No, I told them you wanted to have a

07:15.007 --> 07:18.351
- look at it first. Nobody's touched it.
- I'm going to need to take it apart.

07:19.012 --> 07:20.834
It'll take some time.
Go back to the hotel.

07:20.954 --> 07:23.392
- I'll call you if I find anything.
- It's okay, we'll stay.

07:23.512 --> 07:24.335
Seriously.

07:24.455 --> 07:27.240
This could take 10 to 12 hours.
There's nothing you can do here.

07:27.402 --> 07:29.803
<i>Just go back to the hotel.
I'll call you if I find anything.</i>

07:55.466 --> 07:56.271
<i>Here.</i>

08:02.900 --> 08:04.277
No... Wait, please.

08:05.951 --> 08:07.178
It's all right.

08:09.283 --> 08:10.222
Let me?

08:19.154 --> 08:20.267
Who are you?

08:22.678 --> 08:24.384
My name is Henry Wallace.

08:25.281 --> 08:26.470
I'm sorry to...

08:28.297 --> 08:30.095
I need you to do some work for me.

08:44.580 --> 08:45.392
Hello?

08:45.512 --> 08:48.393
So, someone was monitoring my sister's
computer. I think I've cracked

08:48.513 --> 08:51.366
their trojan, and I've got an address.
Barrett and I are on our way there now.

08:51.528 --> 08:53.193
You said it was going to take 10 hours?

08:53.363 --> 08:55.832
Hey, even I underestimate
how smart I am sometimes.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.257
<i>All right, stay at the house,
and then we'll all go together.</i>

08:58.377 --> 08:59.857
It's too late, we're almost there.

08:59.980 --> 09:01.828
<i>I'll give you an address.
You can meet us.</i>

09:03.106 --> 09:04.254
Okay, what is it?

09:08.516 --> 09:10.048
This looks like the place.

09:10.171 --> 09:12.261
Shouldn't we wait
for Sheppard and Ronon?

09:14.183 --> 09:15.093
Okay...

09:15.469 --> 09:16.617
Stand back.

09:20.430 --> 09:22.385
Okay, well, that works, too.

09:26.185 --> 09:27.945
You don't have
another one of those on you?

09:28.065 --> 09:29.887
Yeah, I've got a shotgun in the car.

09:47.202 --> 09:48.708
You okay?
What the hell happened?

09:48.828 --> 09:50.649
Two men,
they must've been following us.

09:50.769 --> 09:51.769
McKay!

09:51.892 --> 09:53.553
He's not here.
They took him.

10:04.226 --> 10:05.338
Meredith?

10:06.845 --> 10:09.825
- Jeanie. Thank God you're alive!
- What are you doing here?

10:09.945 --> 10:11.869
I came back
when I heard you'd been kidnapped.

10:11.989 --> 10:14.967
- Have you seen Madison and Kaleb?
- Yes, they're a little shaken but okay.

10:15.090 --> 10:17.202
I've put a security detail,
so you don't have to worry.

10:17.413 --> 10:18.482
Then how did you...

10:18.602 --> 10:20.870
I got ambushed trying to track
down the guys who took you.

10:20.990 --> 10:22.638
Oh, great.
That's just great.

10:22.774 --> 10:24.496
First you get me captured
and then you...

10:24.616 --> 10:26.441
I got you captured?
How do you figure that?

10:26.561 --> 10:28.873
Come on! They were monitoring
my computer, right?

10:28.993 --> 10:30.482
- Yeah, so?
- So, would I be here

10:30.602 --> 10:33.863
- if you hadn't sent me those emails?
- Possibly. What is this? A lab?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.990
That's some great detective work there,
Nancy Drew.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.989
- Where the hell are we?
- I have no idea.

10:40.109 --> 10:41.748
They put me on a plane...

10:41.868 --> 10:44.563
Yeah, me too.
Any idea who's behind any of this?

10:48.816 --> 10:49.987
Dr. McKay.

10:52.528 --> 10:54.024
I've heard a lot about you.

10:54.144 --> 10:55.352
It's a pleasure.

10:56.862 --> 11:00.217
I thought you might show up
if your sister went missing.

11:00.552 --> 11:03.948
We couldn't count on it, of course,
but it's a pretty big bonus.

11:04.680 --> 11:05.581
Bonus?

11:06.280 --> 11:09.925
I've no idea who you are but you've made
a terrible mistake bringing me here.

11:10.113 --> 11:11.844
I suggest you let us both go right now,

11:11.964 --> 11:14.098
otherwise, about 100 marines
are gonna come kicking down

11:14.218 --> 11:17.742
- your front door in the next 2 minutes.
- I'm pretty sure they won't, actually.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.141
Your subcutaneous transmitter
has been deactivated.

11:24.447 --> 11:25.539
Who are you?

11:26.611 --> 11:28.580
I should have started with that.

11:29.613 --> 11:31.867
My name is Henry Wallace.

11:32.925 --> 11:35.393
- I'm the president of...
- DMT. Great.

11:35.866 --> 11:37.539
You know who I am, then.

11:37.659 --> 11:39.461
I'm familiar with your work.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.868
What's DMT?

11:40.988 --> 11:42.414
Devlin Medical Technologies.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.743
<i>They're a predominantly
government-funded contractor,</i>

11:44.910 --> 11:47.007
and, unfortunately for us,
they manufacture

11:47.127 --> 11:48.927
our subcutaneous transmitters.

11:49.066 --> 11:50.345
- Great.
- Yeah.

11:50.928 --> 11:52.464
<i>How do you even know I exist?</i>

11:52.931 --> 11:56.134
Your company's only privy to very basic
information about newly declassified

11:56.254 --> 11:57.902
experiments the military is working on.

11:58.022 --> 12:01.071
No, more accurately, my company
is given limited access

12:01.191 --> 12:04.100
to alien advances discovered
through the Stargate Program,

12:05.194 --> 12:08.778
<i>and is asked to integrate them
into Earth-based medical technologies.</i>

12:10.051 --> 12:12.403
- You're not cleared to know that.
- No,

12:12.919 --> 12:13.876
I'm not.

12:14.552 --> 12:16.250
But after years of being

12:16.370 --> 12:21.047
stupefied by the military's endless
and unbelievable advances,

12:21.705 --> 12:23.660
I started to do a little digging.

12:24.174 --> 12:26.666
That's how I found out about the SGC,

12:27.334 --> 12:28.370
<i>Atlantis,</i>

12:29.065 --> 12:29.876
<i>you...</i>

12:31.550 --> 12:34.654
And that's why we've been
monitoring your family's emails for

12:34.908 --> 12:36.365
quite some time now.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.221
What do you want from me?

12:47.429 --> 12:48.766
I've hit a wall

12:49.417 --> 12:50.796
and need some help.

12:57.922 --> 12:59.628
My daughter, Sharon.

13:00.148 --> 13:01.286
What's wrong with her?

13:01.406 --> 13:04.052
She's suffering from acute
lymphocytic leukemia.

13:05.056 --> 13:06.304
I'm very sorry, but...

13:06.424 --> 13:09.868
She's been particularly unresponsive
to induction chemotherapy...

13:10.645 --> 13:13.756
Prednisone, Vincristine,
cranial irradiation...

13:13.876 --> 13:16.164
I don't know what all that means.
How am I supposed to help?

13:16.284 --> 13:19.687
The best doctors in the world have told
her to start saying her goodbyes,

13:20.861 --> 13:22.241
<i>begin making funeral plans...</i>

13:22.361 --> 13:26.361
That's what I'm saying. Neither of us
are doctors. I have a PHD, 2 actually...

13:26.486 --> 13:29.474
The latest project my company
has been working on for the SGC

13:29.594 --> 13:32.138
involves applying advances
in nanotechnology

13:32.258 --> 13:33.926
<i>to cure injury and disease.</i>

13:34.423 --> 13:36.443
<i>- We were close to a prototype.</i>
- Wait a second.

13:36.685 --> 13:40.050
Sharon was injected with the first batch
of nanites one week ago.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.886
You barely got manufacturing perfected.
I'm working on the coding.

13:43.009 --> 13:44.576
It's months away!
They're not ready!

13:44.798 --> 13:47.057
My team thought they had
ironed out most of the coding.

13:47.177 --> 13:48.864
"Ironed out"?
It's not that easy.

13:48.984 --> 13:50.556
I know that, now.

13:51.010 --> 13:53.111
- They're malfunctioning.
- Well, of course they are.

13:53.231 --> 13:55.551
And it's not just
that they're not working, they're...

13:56.797 --> 13:59.199
They're actually causing
more problems than the cancer.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.028
Her body is rejecting them.

14:02.985 --> 14:05.213
When I intercepted your correspondence
with Jeanie,

14:05.383 --> 14:08.808
I desperately needed someone familiar
with the coding to come fix the program.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.977
- Right, so Jeanie was just the bait.
- No.

14:11.335 --> 14:14.241
No. From what I could tell, she had a
firmer grasp of the coding than you did.

14:14.361 --> 14:17.660
I don't think it's fair to judge me on a
couple of emails. They don't reflect...

14:17.967 --> 14:20.512
- It doesn't matter.
- If we don't do something quickly,

14:21.245 --> 14:22.759
Sharon's going to die.

14:24.819 --> 14:27.994
Get the nanites fully operational,
and I'll let you go.

14:28.986 --> 14:29.812
Really?

14:30.548 --> 14:32.664
- Absolutely.
- And if we don't?

14:35.237 --> 14:38.324
That's right, Sir. They must
have neutralized the transmitter.

14:38.861 --> 14:40.951
What about the lead you were following?

14:41.071 --> 14:43.631
Dead end. It's a small,
rented room with a router

14:43.751 --> 14:45.595
that ported data to a site in Singapore.

14:45.987 --> 14:48.054
I mean, who knows where
it was forwarded from there.

14:48.174 --> 14:50.365
We've got our best IT guys
on the job, though.

14:50.485 --> 14:53.677
We'll start tracing the paper trail,
and hopefully it's gonna turn up a lead.

14:53.797 --> 14:56.344
We've combed the security,
traffic, and ABM cameras from the area.

14:56.464 --> 14:58.337
We've got ambush talking to witnesses...

14:58.457 --> 15:00.528
We've got half
the Vancouver PD on this one.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.684
We're going to get 'em.

15:09.603 --> 15:11.174
<i>- They're not communicating.</i>
- What?

15:11.294 --> 15:14.355
The nanites're causing all the problems,
going after some cells redundantly,

15:14.475 --> 15:17.669
they're ignoring others, they've caused
at least 3 partially clogged arteries...

15:18.042 --> 15:20.943
<i>Something in their coding is stopping
them from understanding each other.</i>

15:21.063 --> 15:21.846
Great.

15:22.724 --> 15:25.051
- Are you even listening to me?
- You lost me at "nanites."

15:25.213 --> 15:27.177
Hey, idiot, we need to solve
this coding problem.

15:27.297 --> 15:29.403
No, what we need to do
is get the hell out of here.

15:29.523 --> 15:31.643
I know, by solving the coding problem.

15:31.763 --> 15:34.012
- So young, and so naive.
- You got a better idea?

15:34.132 --> 15:36.735
Yes. Look. They gave
these computers network access

15:36.933 --> 15:38.931
so we could monitor Sharon
in real time, right?

15:39.051 --> 15:41.359
Which means I can also hack
into the security mainframe.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.549
What about Sharon?

15:43.673 --> 15:46.616
- What about us?
- We can do this. We can help this girl.

15:46.736 --> 15:48.858
And then what?
He's just going to let us go?

15:49.414 --> 15:51.199
He's just going to give up his life,

15:51.319 --> 15:54.115
lose his company, get carted off
to prison? He'll be fine with that?

15:54.235 --> 15:56.773
He's desperate.
I think any parent would understand...

15:56.893 --> 15:58.613
You think?
Let's just for a second

15:58.733 --> 16:01.798
imagine that we live in this magical
land of unicorns and wizards

16:01.920 --> 16:04.814
and kindhearted people who you can
take at their word. Let's assume

16:04.934 --> 16:06.830
that he lets us go if we save her.

16:07.181 --> 16:10.579
What if we fail, huh? What if she dies?
How happy do you think he'll be then?

16:10.699 --> 16:13.058
He'll just let us waltz out
the door with an "aw, shucks,

16:13.178 --> 16:15.300
<i>well, better luck next
time, tiger" attitude?</i>

16:15.983 --> 16:16.983
<i>Exactly.</i>

16:17.860 --> 16:21.623
We need to get out of here. I've worked
on a code to unlock the keypad doors.

16:23.501 --> 16:24.302
You ready?

16:24.422 --> 16:26.472
What happens
after you get the door open?

16:26.922 --> 16:29.660
Well, I memorized the building's layout
from this computer here.

16:30.564 --> 16:31.284
Okay.

16:41.673 --> 16:42.673
Come on.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.141
Come.

17:01.077 --> 17:03.533
You said there was
a stairway entrance here.

17:03.653 --> 17:05.276
There's supposed to be.

17:05.396 --> 17:08.114
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
We got to go back.

17:08.233 --> 17:10.940
- Go back? Why?
- Because I got all mixed around.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.688
We start again. Maybe what I thought
was north was south. Hard to tell.

17:13.808 --> 17:16.097
Can't believe I'm betting my life
on your sense of direction.

17:16.217 --> 17:18.806
- I've an excellent sense of direction.
- Remember in West Edmonton Mall

17:18.925 --> 17:20.560
dad had to call the police to find you?

17:20.682 --> 17:22.795
- That mall is huge!
- There are maps every 7 metres!

17:22.915 --> 17:25.069
Misleading ones.
Now, come on. We got to go back.

17:25.190 --> 17:26.163
Oh, man.

17:39.710 --> 17:40.736
Oh, shoot.

17:42.956 --> 17:44.047
Run! Run!

18:13.140 --> 18:14.687
Why would you do that?

18:15.967 --> 18:17.062
Why would...

18:19.490 --> 18:20.916
My daughter is dying.

18:21.295 --> 18:23.532
You kidnapped us.
What did you expect?

18:24.192 --> 18:25.927
I shouldn't have
given you network access.

18:26.047 --> 18:28.097
Yeah, well, it's a rookie mistake.

18:29.672 --> 18:31.587
You're never going to help me.

18:32.543 --> 18:34.386
- Are you?
- You're gonna kill us either way.

18:34.508 --> 18:36.739
- What exactly is our incentive?
- I gave you my word.

18:36.859 --> 18:39.135
Which means exactly nothing to me.

18:44.699 --> 18:45.669
Please.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.569
My wife died three years ago.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.140
I can't go through that again.

18:53.526 --> 18:55.021
<i>Sharon's all I have.</i>

18:56.133 --> 18:57.168
You can save her.

18:57.288 --> 18:59.135
Look, this is an experimental
medical program.

18:59.255 --> 19:01.339
It may never work.
All this might've been for nothing.

19:01.462 --> 19:04.344
Worst case scenario, I thought
I would have weeks with Sharon.

19:05.213 --> 19:08.051
Now, if things stay as they are,
I'm lucky to have days.

19:08.171 --> 19:10.211
You never should have injected her.

19:13.149 --> 19:13.921
No.

19:14.576 --> 19:15.364
<i>No.</i>

19:17.511 --> 19:18.672
It will work.

19:20.544 --> 19:21.892
It has to work.

19:22.706 --> 19:23.725
What is that?

19:23.845 --> 19:25.201
A dose of nanites.

19:25.544 --> 19:27.460
- Meredith...
- Wait, wait. Please.

19:27.690 --> 19:29.081
No. I'm sorry.

19:29.874 --> 19:31.266
You need an incentive.

19:31.969 --> 19:32.856
Don't!

19:41.254 --> 19:42.171
Fix this.

19:43.109 --> 19:44.409
Or they both die.

20:01.205 --> 20:02.231
You okay?

20:03.502 --> 20:04.702
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:06.671 --> 20:09.156
You were right. They're not
communicating. They're not doing lots of

20:09.276 --> 20:11.494
- things they should be doing, in fact.
- Yeah, I know.

20:11.616 --> 20:14.090
<i>See, the thing is, even though DMT
manufactured their own nanites,</i>

20:14.662 --> 20:16.114
the coding, the programming...

20:16.234 --> 20:18.467
Most of it's lifted directly
from the Replicators.

20:18.658 --> 20:20.866
Yeah, well, the thing is,
as much as I hate to admit it,

20:20.986 --> 20:22.985
we're just beginning
to understand that coding.

20:23.105 --> 20:25.539
The Wraith we've been working with
has helped us...

20:25.659 --> 20:27.409
Wait, you've been working with a Wraith?

20:27.529 --> 20:28.790
Yeah, it's a long story.

20:29.169 --> 20:30.627
What I'm trying to say is

20:30.747 --> 20:34.800
this program that we're pushing on it
is designed to restrain them...

20:34.920 --> 20:37.736
Very specifically, to make sure they
don't get out of control. So much so...

20:37.856 --> 20:40.578
- They're completely ineffective.
- Like we tied their hands.

20:40.698 --> 20:44.118
- So we have to cut them loose.
- Exactly. The nanites can't replicate.

20:44.546 --> 20:47.487
Technically by unleashing them, we might
make all our little problems go away.

20:47.607 --> 20:48.426
Okay,

20:48.879 --> 20:52.038
that shouldn't be too complex. Altering
2,000 maybe 3,000 lines of code.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.272
- Yeah, it's a... cinch.
- Yeah.

20:57.610 --> 21:01.029
- I'm really sorry about all this.
- Don't wanna talk about this right now.

21:01.149 --> 21:03.227
We need to write this program
and upload it.

21:03.347 --> 21:05.077
I'll yell at you later, okay?

21:20.931 --> 21:22.735
We're going in circles here.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.305
I don't even get what we're doing.

21:26.275 --> 21:28.585
We're trying to match the corporations.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.895
See the company that rented the space
for the internet router

21:32.015 --> 21:34.784
was owned by another company which was
owned by another and owned by another.

21:34.904 --> 21:37.165
Trying to connect the company
that was monitoring Jeanie's

21:37.285 --> 21:39.251
<i>computer to a company
that would want to take her.</i>

21:39.371 --> 21:42.081
Probably a company owned by the trust.
We just haven't found a connection.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.103
<i>They knew enough
to shut down the transmitter.</i>

21:44.223 --> 21:46.670
Exactly. You know, the fact that they
even knew that tells us that

21:46.790 --> 21:49.514
they're pretty intimate with
the operations of the Stargate Program.

21:49.775 --> 21:51.346
Again, the Trust.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.686
We should widen the net.

21:53.806 --> 21:55.206
Maybe it wasn't one of them.

21:56.311 --> 21:57.838
Other known enemy groups?

21:58.307 --> 22:00.623
- Or an ally.
- Chinese? Russians?

22:00.743 --> 22:04.021
McKay said he was working on a program
which shut down the Replicators.

22:04.141 --> 22:06.304
Was he working in tandem
with anyone here on Earth?

22:06.424 --> 22:08.238
No. No, not that I know of.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.988
Wait. There was a medical
company that was working on

22:11.108 --> 22:13.763
other nanite programs but they didn't
have any direct dealings with him.

22:13.883 --> 22:15.154
Which company was that?

22:15.731 --> 22:18.287
I don't know.
Give me a sec. I'll find out.

22:20.966 --> 22:23.413
- Where are you going?
- Get some food.

22:23.533 --> 22:26.840
In case you forgot, McKay
and his sister are still missing.

22:27.558 --> 22:31.142
What? You want my help
dissecting corporate structures?

22:31.443 --> 22:33.400
When you find someone to point a gun at,

22:33.520 --> 22:34.764
you let me know.

22:34.914 --> 22:36.157
Fair enough.

22:40.832 --> 22:42.506
What's it been? A couple of hours?

22:42.744 --> 22:43.844
Something like that.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.211
So, what? No updates?

22:45.331 --> 22:47.600
I mean, I know we're hostages and all,
but, come on...

22:48.044 --> 22:49.814
took me like 10 sec
to upload the program.

22:49.934 --> 22:52.387
- What's taking so much time?
- It'll take a while to figure out

22:52.507 --> 22:54.756
if our coding patch
makes the nanites fight the cancer.

22:54.876 --> 22:57.248
When we activated them in Weir,
she was healed almost instantly.

22:57.368 --> 23:00.144
That time, the replicator cells
actually replaced her damaged cells.

23:00.264 --> 23:01.552
Our guys have to heal them.

23:01.672 --> 23:04.581
But still, by now they should have seen
a massive changes in her condition.

23:04.701 --> 23:07.957
- Why aren't they telling us anything?
- Sit down. You're driving me crazy.

23:18.583 --> 23:21.056
- Are you gonna marry that Katie girl?
- What?

23:21.176 --> 23:23.314
- You heard me.
- Where did that come from?

23:23.434 --> 23:26.212
I'm trying to take my mind off the fact
I have tiny robots running through

23:26.332 --> 23:29.235
my veins 'cause you need help with your
homework. You'd rather talk about that?

23:29.357 --> 23:30.182
Not really.

23:30.302 --> 23:32.147
<i>- Are you going to marry her?</i>
- I don't know.

23:32.267 --> 23:33.905
<i>You've been dating for over a year now.</i>

23:34.027 --> 23:35.363
I'm aware of that, thank you.

23:35.483 --> 23:38.192
- You think you'll find someone better?
- No, it's not that.

23:38.312 --> 23:39.788
'Cause you're not.

23:40.065 --> 23:40.880
Hang on.

23:41.042 --> 23:44.084
The fact that you've found a nice girl
who's willing to put up with all your

23:44.204 --> 23:45.748
many little flaws is a miracle.

23:45.868 --> 23:47.589
- Look.
<i>- Plus, physically, you're...</i>

23:48.057 --> 23:49.601
Well, how do I put this?

23:49.721 --> 23:51.211
You're no John Sheppard.

23:51.805 --> 23:52.633
Okay.

23:53.530 --> 23:57.063
Let's go back to talking about how it's
my fault, I think I liked that better.

23:57.183 --> 23:58.468
Come with me.

24:03.836 --> 24:05.175
Oh, come in, come in.

24:05.743 --> 24:09.385
Sharon, I want to introduce you
to Rodney McKay, Jeanie Miller.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.657
They're the ones that saved you.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.464
It's very nice to meet you.

24:14.868 --> 24:16.115
Thank you so much.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.430
How are you feeling?

24:17.714 --> 24:19.357
Better than I've felt in years.

24:19.477 --> 24:20.500
<i>And the cancer?</i>

24:21.056 --> 24:22.761
We can't find any trace of it.

24:29.429 --> 24:32.396
<i>And I'm nervous, right? Because, you
know, it's an admiral I'm talking to,</i>

24:32.516 --> 24:33.801
<i>so I say to him,</i>

24:34.182 --> 24:38.966
<i>"Sir,
if you use an I37 form instead of an N1,</i>

24:39.102 --> 24:43.282
you can save yourself from using,
like, like, like, a hundred G72s,"

24:43.979 --> 24:46.097
and there's this pause.

24:47.617 --> 24:49.167
No one says anything for, like,

24:49.497 --> 24:51.437
I don't know, felt like minutes,

24:51.902 --> 24:55.346
and, finally, the admiral
looks over at Landry and he goes, "Hank.

24:56.054 --> 24:58.020
not only is your boy here right,

24:58.464 --> 25:02.753
but I think we found ourselves
a new bingo caller for sunday nights."

25:03.867 --> 25:04.763
Bingo!

25:05.115 --> 25:05.957
God!

25:06.636 --> 25:07.647
<i>"I37!"</i>

25:07.825 --> 25:08.713
<i>"N1!"</i>

25:08.850 --> 25:10.592
"G72!" Bingo!

25:13.667 --> 25:16.072
Who ever said the admiral
didn't have a sense of humor?

25:17.769 --> 25:20.451
Then there was this other time
that general O'Neill and I,

25:20.571 --> 25:23.040
- we were...
- Tell me you have something.

25:23.591 --> 25:25.969
- Devlin Medical Technologies.
- That means?

25:26.089 --> 25:28.713
- We got somebody to point your gun at.
- Sweet.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.721
- What are you going to do with us?
- Hey!

25:41.391 --> 25:42.842
We're celebrating here.

25:42.965 --> 25:45.511
She's still got nanites inside her,
and we're both still hostages,

25:45.631 --> 25:48.132
so you'll excuse me
if I skip the champagne.

25:48.353 --> 25:50.089
I'm a man of my word.

25:51.366 --> 25:53.872
- I'm going to let you go.
- What, just like that?

25:54.400 --> 25:55.406
Just like that.

25:55.526 --> 25:58.048
- But you'll be arrested.
- Not helping.

25:58.510 --> 25:59.343
I know.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.783
I've known I was going to prison from
the moment I decided to kidnap you.

26:05.805 --> 26:06.811
I don't care.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.471
My daughter's going to live.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.781
That's all that matters.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.784
- I can't expect you to understand.
- You're right, I don't.

26:17.169 --> 26:19.243
We've done a great thing here today.

26:19.858 --> 26:21.553
And not just for my daughter.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.819
<i>Hell, we might have just
cured cancer altogether.</i>

26:25.048 --> 26:26.307
<i>So, please,</i>

26:26.967 --> 26:27.944
a toast.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.359
To the future.

26:34.608 --> 26:36.270
Sir, we have a problem.

26:41.336 --> 26:42.346
Clear!

26:45.172 --> 26:46.764
Nothing. Going again.

26:47.732 --> 26:48.764
<i>Charging.</i>

26:50.295 --> 26:51.215
Clear!

26:58.856 --> 26:59.901
Turn it off.

27:06.982 --> 27:08.081
I'm so sorry.

27:10.606 --> 27:11.677
She was fine.

27:13.295 --> 27:15.225
- I don't understand.
- Her heart just stopped.

27:15.345 --> 27:17.083
We couldn't get it pumping again.

27:17.325 --> 27:19.036
I'm not sure what happened.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.264
- We need to get out of here.
- I know.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.932
I need to get you back to the SGC.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.418
Your nanites are running
on the same programming.

27:36.538 --> 27:40.023
Okay. I'm going to see if I can distract
the guard, I need you to go. Jeanie?

27:40.143 --> 27:41.894
What are you doing?

27:44.563 --> 27:45.775
I'm so sorry.

27:48.044 --> 27:49.829
My brother and I need to leave.

27:50.152 --> 27:53.173
We need to get to a bigger
lab with more scientists.

27:53.982 --> 27:55.095
Please.

27:58.049 --> 27:59.471
I don't know what to do.

28:00.195 --> 28:01.725
I can't imagine

28:01.903 --> 28:03.601
what you're going through right now.

28:03.721 --> 28:06.276
I know you're angry.
I would be, too, but...

28:07.260 --> 28:08.819
If I go untreated...

28:10.450 --> 28:13.068
Look, I have a family,
a husband, a daughter.

28:13.230 --> 28:14.339
Please.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.698
I need to get help,
and I can't do it here.

28:20.043 --> 28:21.187
I'm sorry.

28:33.885 --> 28:36.044
- You said she was dead.
- She was.

28:50.986 --> 28:52.316
The nanites are still active.

28:52.444 --> 28:55.073
Once they've beaten the cancer, they're
supposed to shut themselves down.

28:55.193 --> 28:58.347
Never been tested in a live subject,
only worked sporadically in simulations.

28:58.467 --> 29:01.419
Look, I told you, this programming
is nowhere near ready to implement.

29:01.556 --> 29:02.925
Wait, you're saying

29:03.045 --> 29:04.659
the nanites brought her back to life?

29:04.779 --> 29:06.288
It's the only viable explanation.

29:06.450 --> 29:09.833
Then why did she die in the first place?
Shouldn't they have kept her alive?

29:09.995 --> 29:11.335
- It's a good point.
- Wait.

29:11.472 --> 29:14.213
The doctor said her heart just stopped?
Seemingly out of nowhere?

29:14.375 --> 29:15.372
Right.

29:15.563 --> 29:17.876
Does Sharon have any heart problems?
Unrelated to the cancer?

29:17.999 --> 29:20.773
Yes, she has a mitral
regurgitation problem.

29:21.188 --> 29:22.391
<i>Heart murmur.</i>

29:22.780 --> 29:25.180
- What, you don't think...
- We broadened the parameters.

29:25.316 --> 29:27.480
They weren't just programmed
to cure the cancer.

29:27.617 --> 29:29.812
Once they were done with leukemia,
they moved on to heart,

29:29.974 --> 29:32.346
<i>- easiest way to fix that...</i>
- Shut it down while they repaired.

29:32.469 --> 29:34.569
<i>That doesn't make any sense.
Shutting down the heart</i>

29:34.692 --> 29:37.260
and starving the brain of oxygen
would cause severe brain damage.

29:37.384 --> 29:40.521
- Damage they could technically fix.
- They could repair the tissue, yes, but

29:40.658 --> 29:43.121
<i>the patient would lose their memories,
their language skills,</i>

29:43.241 --> 29:45.695
- any sense of self.
- They don't care about that.

29:45.815 --> 29:48.982
Look, they were designed to fix the body
of all physical maladies. I mean,

29:49.102 --> 29:51.276
preserving a sense of self
isn't one of their directives.

29:51.399 --> 29:52.401
<i>So...</i>

29:53.247 --> 29:55.629
She's going to be stuck
in this vegetative state?

29:56.230 --> 29:58.694
Technically, her brain
is perfectly healthy.

29:58.814 --> 30:00.472
It's like she's been

30:00.759 --> 30:02.344
reset to zero, so to speak.

30:03.448 --> 30:06.761
Meredith. What about me?
I don't have any cancer.

30:06.965 --> 30:08.958
They'll look around
and go straight for...

30:09.078 --> 30:10.428
Your epilepsy.

30:10.735 --> 30:12.354
I don't wanna be shut down for repairs.

30:12.516 --> 30:14.398
Okay, okay, the first thing
we got to do is...

30:20.149 --> 30:21.393
- You guys okay?
- <i>How...</i>

30:21.516 --> 30:23.907
We need to get Jeanie to the SGC!
Is the Daedalus still in orbit?

30:24.069 --> 30:25.692
You're welcome. It was a daring rescue.

30:25.815 --> 30:28.829
Thanks, but we're not out of the woods.
We have to get to the SGC now!

30:30.373 --> 30:31.835
Daedalus, this is Sheppard.

30:31.958 --> 30:33.188
We need a lift.

30:43.001 --> 30:46.317
Okay, I've put Jeanie in a medically
induced coma, and I've broken her legs.

30:46.700 --> 30:47.807
You what?

30:48.217 --> 30:49.666
We need to slow down the nanites.

30:49.789 --> 30:51.904
This could buy us 10 hours, at least.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.822
You broke her legs?

30:53.942 --> 30:55.405
Couldn't you give her a disease?

30:55.525 --> 30:57.316
She need an immediate and severe trauma.

30:57.478 --> 30:59.759
Besides, if we shut them down
before she's properly healed,

30:59.879 --> 31:01.361
all she has is a few broken bones.

31:01.523 --> 31:03.412
Instead of a disease
she'd have to fight alone.

31:03.532 --> 31:06.516
Exactly. I'm pretty sure we can't just
keep doing this. Sooner or later,

31:06.636 --> 31:08.497
the nanites are gonna
abandon her broken bones

31:08.617 --> 31:10.524
and move to her brain,
so we need to move fast.

31:10.644 --> 31:12.818
Can't we just blast her
with an electromagnetic pulse?

31:12.938 --> 31:15.978
These nanites were designed specifically
to be immune to EM field fluctuations.

31:16.115 --> 31:18.106
- Wonderful.
- So we have 10 hours to come up with

31:18.226 --> 31:20.464
- a program that shuts down the nanites?
- Right.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.379
So what's the plan?

31:22.839 --> 31:25.154
Well, as embarrassing
as I find this to say...

31:25.810 --> 31:27.095
I need some help.

31:31.427 --> 31:32.838
This was a bad idea.

31:32.958 --> 31:35.226
Yeah, well, it's the only one I've got.

31:49.768 --> 31:51.955
Why have you brought me here?

31:55.181 --> 31:57.834
<i>Look, you understand the
replicator coding better than anyone.</i>

31:57.957 --> 31:59.795
<i>If we're going to do this quickly, then</i>

32:00.047 --> 32:01.372
we need your help.

32:04.467 --> 32:06.636
And why should you care?
We're gonna kill you either way.

32:06.756 --> 32:08.245
That's what you're thinking?

32:10.029 --> 32:12.051
Okay. So, incentives...

32:13.596 --> 32:15.894
First off,
we have no interest in killing you.

32:16.287 --> 32:18.312
You've probably already
figured that out by now, but

32:18.432 --> 32:20.014
we can't let you go, either, because

32:20.134 --> 32:22.991
you know too much about Atlantis. Unless
you could prove you're trustworthy...

32:23.160 --> 32:25.751
<i>And this would go a long way
towards proving that.</i>

32:27.474 --> 32:28.474
Right.

32:29.157 --> 32:31.748
Yeah, pretty sure
I wouldn't buy that either.

32:35.807 --> 32:37.082
Do you have any relatives?

32:40.728 --> 32:44.063
Do Wraith have brothers or sisters?
I don't know how it works...

32:46.313 --> 32:47.926
But with us, with

32:48.088 --> 32:49.128
my people,

32:50.343 --> 32:52.163
those bonds mean a lot.

32:54.746 --> 32:56.380
My sister is in trouble, and

32:56.898 --> 32:58.457
it's pretty much all my fault.

32:59.810 --> 33:02.024
You could help us. You could save her.

33:07.011 --> 33:09.161
That doesn't mean anything
to you, does it?

33:10.436 --> 33:13.464
I suppose it wouldn't mean much to me,
either, if I was in your place.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.370
You and I both know

33:21.493 --> 33:23.968
that if we can figure out how
to shut down these earth-made nanites,

33:24.088 --> 33:26.423
it would be a giant step toward
shutting down the Replicators.

33:27.448 --> 33:29.056
I know you lost your hive.

33:29.176 --> 33:32.413
I have no idea how horrible
that must have been for you,

33:32.949 --> 33:35.765
but knowing they're still out there,
that you alone could do something,

33:35.885 --> 33:37.635
that's got to be driving you crazy.

33:39.699 --> 33:41.265
So don't do this for me,

33:41.525 --> 33:43.384
don't do this for my sister...

33:44.073 --> 33:45.502
Do this for yourself.

33:46.227 --> 33:48.099
Do this because you know you can,

33:48.372 --> 33:50.484
and because you know
it'll help destroy the Replicators

33:50.604 --> 33:51.782
once and for all.

33:53.557 --> 33:54.760
<i>What do you say?</i>

34:02.072 --> 34:03.072
Thank you.

34:45.496 --> 34:48.437
All right, there's a few bugs
to code out, but I think we're close.

34:48.574 --> 34:49.443
We?

34:49.696 --> 34:53.563
Hey, I have been contributing. Now,
if I could suggest a few, targets...

34:54.753 --> 34:55.996
Are you okay?

34:57.623 --> 34:58.729
No.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.063
<i>What if he's faking?</i>

35:05.388 --> 35:07.411
Maybe he's just milking
it for a hot meal.

35:07.531 --> 35:08.567
No, I believe him.

35:08.729 --> 35:10.488
He can't finish the coding
without feeding.

35:11.563 --> 35:13.312
I understand exactly
what he's doing, but

35:13.435 --> 35:15.452
he's far more versed
at implementing it than I am.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.332
Maybe if I had a couple of weeks, but

35:17.455 --> 35:19.159
he's the only one
who can do it in a day.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.683
I don't know what to say,
but the NID is not gonna provide us

35:21.806 --> 35:23.540
with a human for him to feed on.

35:24.010 --> 35:25.023
I know.

35:27.241 --> 35:28.526
It needs to be me.

35:29.196 --> 35:30.072
What?

35:32.011 --> 35:33.446
I want him to feed on me.

35:38.227 --> 35:39.306
You wanna what?

35:39.468 --> 35:41.728
Let him feed off me,
get his strength back,

35:41.854 --> 35:44.095
then he can finish the coding
and save Jeanie.

35:44.215 --> 35:46.677
Then what? Force him
to give you your life back?

35:46.797 --> 35:48.855
- He's not gonna do that.
- Sharon died.

35:49.507 --> 35:50.860
Half an hour ago.

35:51.727 --> 35:54.202
I don't understand. What happened?
I thought the nanites would...

35:54.325 --> 35:56.329
This time it wasn't a problem
with the programming.

35:56.457 --> 35:58.111
It was a manufacturing defect.

35:58.452 --> 36:00.452
Look, in Layman's terms,

36:00.572 --> 36:03.121
the nanites ran out of steam while
they were repairing her arteries.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.427
She bled out internally.

36:05.547 --> 36:07.083
There was nothing we could do.

36:09.476 --> 36:11.478
I can't lose my sister, John.

36:12.066 --> 36:14.299
How am I gonna explain that
to her husband? To her kid?

36:15.038 --> 36:16.384
That Wraith'll kill you.

36:17.335 --> 36:19.596
- That's my choice to make.
- No, it's not.

36:20.290 --> 36:23.972
You're an invaluable member of my team,
and you report directly to me.

36:24.123 --> 36:25.727
You wanna talk about chain of command?

36:25.941 --> 36:28.919
- You are not doing this.
- She's here because of me.

36:29.917 --> 36:33.033
I can't fix the problem,
but I can help the guy who can.

36:33.635 --> 36:35.927
Look, this was not
an easy decision to make.

36:36.450 --> 36:38.323
- I can't.
- Please.

36:43.493 --> 36:44.621
I'm sorry.

36:51.555 --> 36:54.803
We're going over the data.
We don't understand what happened.

36:56.181 --> 36:57.292
I'm sorry.

37:00.655 --> 37:01.746
And Jeanie?

37:01.980 --> 37:03.648
She's not gonna make it.

37:06.505 --> 37:08.177
We brought in a...

37:09.347 --> 37:12.312
specialist from the Pegasus galaxy.

37:13.161 --> 37:15.430
Part of an enemy race called the Wraith.

37:16.013 --> 37:18.318
Somehow, McKay has convinced him to

37:19.229 --> 37:22.318
create a program to shut down
the nanites in Jeanie's body.

37:23.548 --> 37:24.414
And?

37:24.817 --> 37:26.938
He was close, real close, but

37:27.184 --> 37:29.794
he hasn't fed in a few weeks,
so he collapsed.

37:30.316 --> 37:33.068
He's too weak
to finish the coding modifications.

37:35.610 --> 37:37.154
I don't understand.

37:37.578 --> 37:40.164
If it means saving her life,
why not just feed him?

37:40.387 --> 37:42.178
Well, he feeds on...

37:43.996 --> 37:45.133
humans.

37:45.636 --> 37:47.098
Their life force.

37:48.629 --> 37:49.723
I see.

37:49.859 --> 37:51.882
Little hard to find volunteers.

37:53.932 --> 37:56.318
- So Jeanie will...
- She's going to die.

37:57.390 --> 37:59.112
Just like Sharon.

38:01.632 --> 38:02.824
I'm so sorry.

38:05.153 --> 38:06.479
I'm sure you are.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.285
<i>This is Kaleb,</i>

38:19.927 --> 38:21.280
<i>her husband...</i>

38:21.582 --> 38:24.452
<i>And, Madison, her little daughter.</i>

38:32.952 --> 38:34.648
I never meant for any of this to happen.

38:35.289 --> 38:36.779
I know you didn't...

38:37.943 --> 38:39.156
But it did.

38:41.234 --> 38:43.202
Now McKay's blaming himself.

38:43.735 --> 38:45.033
I know better.

38:48.066 --> 38:49.329
You know better.

39:02.625 --> 39:03.627
Come on.

39:05.612 --> 39:07.995
- Can I help you, Sir?
- No. No problem.

39:08.397 --> 39:09.781
May I see that, Sir?

39:11.766 --> 39:13.913
- No, you may not.
- Sir. The card, please.

39:18.447 --> 39:21.021
- You're not Dr. Lee, Sir.
- Was that lee's card?

39:21.167 --> 39:23.858
You know, we were just at the gym,
and must have swapped pants, so,

39:23.986 --> 39:27.044
- would you just open the door for me?
- Not without a card, Sir.

39:27.164 --> 39:29.697
I'm Dr. Rodney mcKay. This is my lab.
Would you please open the door?

39:29.838 --> 39:32.087
- I can't do that, sir.
- This is a matter of life or death.

39:32.214 --> 39:33.844
Open the door! I'm under...

39:34.715 --> 39:36.386
- Sheppard?
- Let him in.

39:45.624 --> 39:48.159
- What...
- I was showing Wallace the labs.

39:48.279 --> 39:50.010
<i>The Wraith got the upper hand.</i>

39:50.130 --> 39:51.758
<i>That's what the report's going to say.</i>

39:51.878 --> 39:52.700
You...

39:53.975 --> 39:56.490
- Come on. You've got work to do.
- No, he does not.

39:57.238 --> 39:58.822
I have completed the reprogramming.

39:59.464 --> 40:00.666
<i>That was quick.</i>

40:01.214 --> 40:02.580
Well, get it uploaded.

40:19.841 --> 40:21.592
- Jeanie?
- Mer...

40:21.891 --> 40:23.548
It's okay. It's okay.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.179
Man... Medical comas are weird.

40:27.731 --> 40:28.933
Yeah, well,

40:29.243 --> 40:31.264
you're not the first to mention it.

40:32.379 --> 40:34.258
- Did you...
- Yes.

40:34.548 --> 40:35.699
So I... I'm...

40:35.890 --> 40:37.337
<i>You are absolutely fine.</i>

40:37.534 --> 40:40.651
I mean, aside from
a few inert nanites in you.

40:42.450 --> 40:43.627
Thanks, Mer.

40:44.274 --> 40:45.349
You know...

40:46.881 --> 40:48.446
I'm really sorry about all this.

40:48.566 --> 40:51.559
Oh, I am going to hold this
over your head for...

40:52.064 --> 40:52.993
Forever.

40:53.649 --> 40:55.740
- It's totally fair.
- Like, you're going to eat a lot

40:55.860 --> 40:58.320
of vegetarian food
and not complain about it.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.440
Sure. Sure.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.934
And you're going to read Madison
3 stories instead of her usual 2...

41:03.054 --> 41:03.914
All right.

41:04.443 --> 41:06.169
You're going to buy me a car.

41:06.289 --> 41:08.785
- Let's not get out of control here.
- You almost got me killed.

41:08.905 --> 41:10.518
That's at least a car. A nice one.

41:10.682 --> 41:13.059
- A hybrid.
- We'll talk about it on the way home.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.007
Home... that sounds great.

41:20.161 --> 41:21.199
I love you.

41:21.817 --> 41:22.654
Yeah.

41:26.526 --> 41:27.691
I love you too.

41:40.589 --> 41:42.498
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

41:42.618 --> 41:44.569
Look who's back.
How's the family?

41:45.530 --> 41:46.714
It was great.

41:47.455 --> 41:48.802
I bought them a Prius.

41:49.038 --> 41:50.112
- Guilt.
- Yeah.

41:50.728 --> 41:51.752
Listen...

41:52.597 --> 41:55.194
- I can't believe what you did.
- I don't really want to talk about it.

41:55.314 --> 41:57.395
You talked Wallace
into sacrificing himself.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.749
No, I didn't.

41:59.213 --> 42:01.155
- Well, then how did he...
- I...

42:04.312 --> 42:06.082
I presented a situation.

42:08.487 --> 42:09.717
He volunteered.

42:12.589 --> 42:14.508
Still, you talked a man
into killing himself.

42:14.628 --> 42:16.526
He wanted to make things right.

42:18.142 --> 42:19.380
I merely...

42:21.658 --> 42:23.062
Presented the situation?

42:25.697 --> 42:26.607
Yeah.

42:30.261 --> 42:31.062
Thanks.

42:38.308 --> 42:39.948
Want to get something to eat?

42:41.676 --> 42:42.532
Sure.

42:46.944 --> 42:47.800
Say...

42:48.366 --> 42:51.099
You and I are about even
when it comes to looks, right?

42:51.278 --> 42:53.095
- Who's been lying to you?
- No, I'm serious.

42:53.215 --> 42:54.388
I am too.

42:54.508 --> 42:56.213
Who's been lying to you?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
