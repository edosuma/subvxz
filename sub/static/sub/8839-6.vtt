14:12.852 --> 14:14.978
I GUESS IT WOULDN'T
BE RIGHT FOR ME

14:15.145 --> 14:17.897
TO LET A FRIEND DOWN
WHEN HE NEEDS ME.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.026
I WAS HOPING YOU'D
SEE IT THAT WAY.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.905
JUST DON'T GET IT
SET THAT I'LL BE
STAYING ON FOREVER.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.491
AS LONG AS YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE THERE,

14:28.659 --> 14:30.410
BUT DON'T COUNT ON IT
BEING PERMANENT.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.370
NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.749
IT'S A DEAL, THEN?

14:36.917 --> 14:40.003
DEAL.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.549
HOW LONG
WILL IT TAKE YOU
TO BE READY?

14:47.928 --> 14:49.304
5 MINUTES?

14:49.471 --> 14:52.599
SEE YOU IN FRONT
OF THE HOTEL
IN 5 MINUTES.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.311
YEAH!

15:08.699 --> 15:10.366
MA TOLD US.
IS HE COMING?

15:10.534 --> 15:12.744
YEAH.
MA, HE'S COMING!

15:12.912 --> 15:14.329
HEY, WHAT HAVE WE
HERE, DAUGHTER?

15:14.496 --> 15:16.205
Mary: ALL THE CHILDREN
WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

15:16.373 --> 15:21.002
Adam: THEY HAVE A PRESENT
HERE FOR YOU AND A SONG
THAT GOES WITH IT.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.963
WE ALL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.884
A HORSESHOE.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.761
FOR GOOD LUCK.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.806
WE THANK YOU.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.516
KIDS?

15:35.684 --> 15:38.394
[BLOWS NOTE]

15:38.562 --> 15:40.980
WE JOURNEY ALONG

15:41.148 --> 15:44.567
QUITE CONTENTED
WITH LIFE

15:44.735 --> 15:50.198
AND TRY TO LIVE
PEACEFUL WITH ALL

15:50.366 --> 15:52.700
WE KEEP OURSELVES
FREE

15:52.868 --> 15:55.912
FROM ALL TROUBLE
AND STRIFE

15:56.080 --> 16:01.626
AND WE'RE GLAD WHEN
OUR FRIENDS ON US CALL

16:01.794 --> 16:04.420
OUR HOME, IT IS HAPPY

16:04.588 --> 16:07.590
AND CHEERFUL
AND BRIGHT

16:07.758 --> 16:12.804
WE'RE CONTENTED,
WE ASK NOTHING MORE

16:12.972 --> 16:14.222
I'M WATCHING.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.807
AND THE REASON
WE PROSPER

16:15.975 --> 16:18.893
I'LL TELL TO YOU NOW

16:19.061 --> 16:24.232
THERE'S A HORSESHOE
HUNG OVER THE DOOR

16:24.400 --> 16:25.858
KEEP THE HORSESHOE

16:26.026 --> 16:29.779
HUNG OVER THE DOOR

16:29.947 --> 16:35.243
IT WILL BRING YOU
GOOD LUCK EVER MORE

16:35.411 --> 16:38.454
IF YOU WANT
TO BE HAPPY

16:38.622 --> 16:41.666
AND FREE
FROM ALL CARE

16:41.834 --> 16:47.213
KEEP THE HORSESHOE
HUNG OVER THE DOOR

16:52.469 --> 16:54.220
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.057
Adam: GOOD LUCK,
MR. INGALLS.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.186
GOOD LUCK
TO YOU, ADAM.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.656
LOVE YOU.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.160
I LOVE YOU.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.961
TAKE CARE
OF MY BABY,
ALL RIGHT?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.173
I WILL, SIR.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.554
WE'D BEST ALL GET
IN THE WAGON, HUH?

17:53.947 --> 17:56.032
GOD BE WITH YOU,
MARY.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.117
HE WILL BE.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.339
I'M GOING TO STUDY
REAL HARD, MARY.

18:11.507 --> 18:15.635
I'M GOING TO BE
A TEACHER SOMEDAY,
JUST LIKE YOU.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.554
I KNOW YOU WILL.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.892
AND I'M GOING TO WRITE
TO YOU EVERY DAY, TOO.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.520
I'LL USE
MY BRAILLE WRITER.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.607
I--I'LL WRITE YOU, TOO.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.694
I LOVE YOU, MARY.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.613
I LOVE YOU.

21:20.237 --> 21:25.616
CAROLINE!

21:25.784 --> 21:27.076
I MUST HAVE
DOZED OFF.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.662
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO LOOK AT IT FROM UP HERE.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.961
OH, CHARLES.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.755
OH!

21:41.758 --> 21:43.050
I DIDN'T REALIZE
TILL THIS MINUTE

21:43.218 --> 21:45.344
HOW MUCH
I'VE MISSED IT.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.432
CHILDREN!

21:49.599 --> 21:51.726
WAKE UP!
WE'RE HOME!

21:51.893 --> 21:53.102
HYAH!

22:15.834 --> 22:19.670
SEE? LOOK UP THERE.
THAT'S WHERE WE SLEEP--
IN THE LOFT.

22:19.838 --> 22:25.051
AND SEE IN HERE? LOOK.
PA PUT A PUMP IN
AND EVERYTHING.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.635
PA, THE PUMP IS BROKEN.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.680
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
DARLING. IT JUST NEEDS
TO BE PRIMED.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.807
WELL, IT SURE IS DIRTY.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.810
WE'LL START CLEANING UP
IN A MINUTE.

22:34.978 --> 22:38.606
FIRST, I WANT EVERYBODY
TO JUST LISTEN.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.817
JUST LISTEN.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.652
I DON'T HEAR
ANYTHING,

22:43.820 --> 22:45.613
EXCEPT MAYBE
A BIRD.

22:45.781 --> 22:49.658
WELL, THAT'S JUST
THE POINT. IT'S QUIET.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.702
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MONTHS,

22:51.870 --> 22:54.955
IT'S REALLY QUIET.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.832
AMEN.

22:58.001 --> 23:00.461
NOW, LET'S GET IT
CLEANED UP.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.027
Carrie: AAH!
HELP, PA!

24:48.195 --> 24:50.154
OH, NO. CARRIE!

24:54.242 --> 24:55.576
CARRIE!

24:56.995 --> 24:59.121
CARRIE, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.165
YES.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.627
HA HA HA!

25:06.296 --> 25:08.339
OH!

25:19.434 --> 25:21.977
NOW IT'S HOME.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.529
THERE YOU GO.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.322
THAT'LL GIVE YOU
A LITTLE PRIVACY,
HUH?

25:33.490 --> 25:34.573
THANKS, PA.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.116
ALL RIGHT,
THE TWO OF YOU
GET READY FOR BED.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.994
DON'T WORRY. I WILL.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO TIRED.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.372
THE BOTH OF YOU
PUT IN A GOOD DAY.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.332
I'LL BE DOWN
TO KISS YOU
GOOD NIGHT.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.209
OK, HONEY.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.302
CARRIE FELL ASLEEP
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
"GOD BLESS LAURA"

25:55.470 --> 25:58.222
AND "GOD BLESS ALBERT."

25:58.390 --> 26:01.517
CAN'T BLAME HER.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

26:01.685 --> 26:03.727
OH, TIRED...

26:03.895 --> 26:05.521
BUT SO GOOD.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.815
YEAH. ME, TOO.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.858
HOUSE SHOULD BE
IN SHIPSHAPE
BY TOMORROW.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.278
YEAH. I'M GOING TO GO
INTO TOWN FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING,

26:12.445 --> 26:13.696
SEE HOW THINGS
ARE THERE.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.698
BE SURE AND STOP
AT THE SCHOOL.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.741
THAT'S MY FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS. I'LL GET
THE CHILDREN REGISTERED.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.828
OH, I HOPE
THEY HAVE
A GOOD TEACHER.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.955
IT'LL BE HARD TO FIND ONE
LIKE MRS. SIMMS,

26:23.123 --> 26:26.709
BUT AT LEAST THEY'LL BE
GOING TO A REAL SCHOOL
AND NOT A LIVERY STABLE.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.627
Laura: ALBERT,
PULL THAT BLANKET CLOSED.

26:28.795 --> 26:31.255
Albert: HOW WAS I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW
YOU WERE CHANGING?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.548
ALBERT!

26:32.716 --> 26:34.300
YES, SIR?

26:34.467 --> 26:37.845
I DON'T WANT YOU OPENING
THAT DRAPE WITHOUT
ASKING LAURA FIRST.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.138
YES, SIR.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.223
AND, LAURA,
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.434
Laura: YES, SIR.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.356
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN OPEN IT NOW.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.818
AND I BETTER NOT
CATCH YOU PEEKING.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.570
PEEKING AT WHAT?

26:54.738 --> 26:56.739
PEEKING AT ME,
THAT'S WHAT.

26:56.906 --> 26:59.658
WHAT'S THERE
TO PEEK AT?

26:59.826 --> 27:01.702
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

27:01.870 --> 27:03.579
NOTHING.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.290
Caroline: LAURA,
HURRY UP NOW.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.334
COMING.

27:13.590 --> 27:17.760
SURE DIDN'T HAVE
THESE PROBLEMS SLEEPING
UNDER THE STAIRS.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.763
AND I'LL BET
SHE SNORES.

27:27.020 --> 27:30.773
[LAURA SNORING]

27:41.159 --> 27:44.495
Albert: I KNEW IT.
I JUST KNEW IT.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.768
HEY. MORNING, CHARLES.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.229
MORNING, JONATHAN.
I WAS HEADING INTO TOWN.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.189
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO COME ALONG.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.066
ANYTHING TO GET OUT
OF THIS HOUSEWORK.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.152
ALICE, I'M GOING
INTO TOWN WITH CHARLES.
BE BACK IN A WHILE.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.154
JUST A MINUTE.
WHEN YOU WENT FISHING
YESTERDAY,

28:19.322 --> 28:21.281
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D HELP ME CLEAN UP
ALL DAY TODAY.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.242
I WILL AS SOON
AS I GET BACK.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.868
WE'LL ONLY BE GONE
FOR A WHILE.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.662
OH, ALL RIGHT.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.832
CHARLES, IF YOU WANT
TO COME OVER FOR SUPPER
TONIGHT, ASK YOUR FAMILY.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.333
WE'VE GOT
MORE THAN ENOUGH FISH.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.793
YOU SURE NO TROUBLE?

28:32.961 --> 28:33.877
NOT AT ALL.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.212
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.339
JUST BE SURE
HE'S BACK IN TWO HOURS.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.757
I PROMISE.

28:38.925 --> 28:39.800
SEE YOU THEN.

28:39.968 --> 28:40.884
SEE YA.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.302
YOU GO FISHING
YESTERDAY?

28:42.470 --> 28:44.638
YEAH. CAUGHT
A MESS OF THEM.

28:45.932 --> 28:48.767
TELL YOU ONE THING.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS.

28:48.935 --> 28:52.187
I AIN'T NEVER
GOING TO MOVE AWAY
FROM HERE AGAIN,

28:52.355 --> 28:56.358
EVEN IF I HAVE TO
EAT FISH EVERY DAY
OF MY LIFE.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.235
HA HA HA!

29:32.812 --> 29:37.232
LAND SAKES, CHARLES,
JUST LOOK AT IT.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.359
LET'S CHECK
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.028
YEAH.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.294
JUST LOOK
AT THIS PLACE.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.133
DUST AN INCH THICK.

30:03.301 --> 30:07.554
HARD TO IMAGINE
THIS TOWN WITHOUT
ANY CHURCH SERVICES.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.641
JONATHAN, CHARLES.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.268
THIS PLACE IS SURE
A MESS, ISN'T IT?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.688
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

30:16.856 --> 30:18.440
THERE'S NO MONEY
FOR A TEACHER,

30:18.608 --> 30:21.276
AND FOLKS JUST STOPPED
COMING IN TO CHURCH.

30:21.444 --> 30:22.903
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE TOWN COUNCIL?

30:23.071 --> 30:24.738
WELL, DR. BAKER'S
STILL HERE.

30:24.906 --> 30:29.952
HE'S NOT MAKING A LIVING,
REALLY. HE'S JUST
LOOKING AFTER LARS.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.329
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MR. HANSON?

30:33.206 --> 30:34.873
HE HAD A STROKE.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.333
HOW BAD IS HE?

30:36.501 --> 30:40.712
DOC SAYS HE'S JUST
GIVEN UP ON LIVING.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.966
HE WAS THE TOWN ELDER.

30:44.133 --> 30:47.052
WHEN THE TOWN DIED,
IT JUST--

30:47.220 --> 30:49.346
WELL, IT BROKE HIM.

30:53.059 --> 30:56.103
I DIDN'T THINK
THINGS WOULD BE
THIS BAD.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.856
ME NEITHER.

30:59.023 --> 31:04.987
THE MAIL COMES IN
OR GOES OUT ONCE EVERY
TWO WEEKS ON SATURDAY.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.115
MRS. FOSTER
LOOKS AFTER IT.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.827
I'M GOING OVER TO SLEEPY EYE
TOMORROW, STOCK UP--

31:11.995 --> 31:15.998
JUST START WITH A SHORT
STOCK TO BEGIN WITH
AND SEE HOW THINGS GO.

31:16.165 --> 31:18.000
ARE YOU GOING TO
CARRY SEED?

31:18.167 --> 31:21.837
I GUESS I'D BETTER.
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS SHUT DOWN.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.380
APPRECIATE IT.

31:23.548 --> 31:27.009
WE'LL SPREAD
THE WORD ABOUT YOUR
BEING OPEN AGAIN.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.427
THANKS.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.928
I BETTER BE GOING.

31:30.096 --> 31:33.724
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
DROP OVER AND SEE
THE DOC?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.017
WE WILL.

31:35.184 --> 31:38.478
BE IN IN A FEW DAYS
FOR SOME SEED, TOO.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.355
GOOD ENOUGH.

31:47.572 --> 31:51.825
IT WAS A TOWN ONCE.
MAYBE IT WILL BE AGAIN.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.829
LET'S GO SEE THE DOC.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.899
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
SOME MORE COFFEE?

32:24.067 --> 32:27.611
NO. NOT FOR ME, DOC.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.697
I WISH I HAD
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU...

32:34.535 --> 32:37.245
BUT THERE JUST ISN'T ANY.

32:37.413 --> 32:41.583
OH, I'VE WANTED TO GO DOWN
THAT ROAD MYSELF...

32:41.751 --> 32:50.968
BUT LARS,
FEW OF THE OTHER OLDER FOLKS
NEEDED TENDING AND...

32:52.595 --> 32:55.055
HOW BAD IS MR. HANSON?

32:55.223 --> 32:56.598
STROKE.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.725
BUT NOT A REAL BAD ONE.

32:58.893 --> 33:01.478
BUT HE JUST
WON'T COME BACK.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.107
HE STARTED THIS TOWN,
YOU KNOW.

33:06.901 --> 33:10.028
WHEN THE TOWN
STARTED TO DIE...

33:11.572 --> 33:14.616
HE STARTED TO DIE
WITH IT.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.787
LARS NEVER HAD
A FAMILY OF HIS OWN.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.831
IT WAS ALWAYS THE TOWN.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.749
IT WAS HIS LIFE.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.086
NOW IT'S OVER.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.426
CAN WE VISIT
WITH HIM, DOC?

33:32.593 --> 33:38.265
SURELY. FIXED A ROOM
FOR HIM UPSTAIRS SO I COULD
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

33:44.814 --> 33:49.443
HE'S GOING TO LOOK
DIFFERENT TO YOU--
A LOT DIFFERENT.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.446
HE WON'T DO FOR HIMSELF...

33:52.613 --> 33:55.157
OR LET ME,
FOR THAT MATTER.

33:56.576 --> 34:00.579
HE ALMOST...
LOOKS LIKE THE TOWN.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.172
LARS?

34:12.008 --> 34:14.801
LARS, YOU'VE GOT
COMPANY.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.389
MR. HANSON?

34:24.520 --> 34:28.815
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE CITY.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.442
IT WASN'T FOR US.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.197
LET ME GET SOME LIGHT
IN HERE.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.744
PULL DOWN THE SHADE.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.705
LARS, IT'S CHARLES
AND JONATHAN.

34:43.873 --> 34:47.209
THEY WANT TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH YOU.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.837
PULL IT DOWN!

34:55.551 --> 35:01.181
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S A LOT OF LIGHT
IN HERE.

35:20.076 --> 35:24.871
THERE IS...NOBODY HERE.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.545
THERE IS NO TOWN.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.881
IT IS GONE.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.598
I KNOW
THE TOWN NEEDS
A LOT OF FIXING UP,

35:43.766 --> 35:46.017
BUT THE TOWN'S
STILL HERE.

35:51.107 --> 35:56.611
P-PEOPLE...
MAKE THE TOWN...

35:56.779 --> 35:59.364
NOT BUILDINGS.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.952
THE PEOPLE
DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.122
THE SPIRIT IS GONE.

36:11.794 --> 36:13.545
NOT IN US.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.964
THAT'S WHY
WE CAME BACK.

36:16.132 --> 36:19.467
WE LOVE THIS TOWN
LIKE YOU DO.

36:24.140 --> 36:28.310
THEN PULL DOWN
YOUR SHADES...

36:29.729 --> 36:35.609
AND MOURN YOUR LOVED ONES
IN PEACE.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.322
WALNUT GROVE IS DEAD.

37:16.734 --> 37:19.986
WE'LL BE BACK TO
SEE YOU IN A WHILE.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.955
REMEMBER HOW THE OLD MAN
USED TO COME IN

38:12.123 --> 38:14.291
AND YELL AT US
IN THE MORNING?

38:14.458 --> 38:15.917
YEAH.

38:16.085 --> 38:19.129
MOSTLY
ABOUT NOTHING.

38:20.756 --> 38:23.967
I USED TO GET SO MAD
I COULD SPIT.

38:25.511 --> 38:31.099
THEN IT GOT SO AS
THAT HE DIDN'T YELL.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.143
I MISS HIM.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.398
REALIZE HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE WE ATE OUTSIDE?

39:20.566 --> 39:21.816
CAN YOU IMAGINE
TRYING THIS
IN THE CITY?

39:21.984 --> 39:23.777
THEY'D RUN OVER US
WITH A WAGON.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.153
SMELLS GOOD.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.322
I HOPE IT IS.
JONATHAN, WILL YOU
SAY THE BLESSING?

39:27.490 --> 39:29.032
CERTAINLY.

39:30.951 --> 39:35.955
DEAR LORD, THANK YOU
FOR ALL OF YOUR BLESSINGS,

39:36.123 --> 39:42.003
FOR THE FOOD ON THE TABLE,
AND FOR THE FRIENDS AROUND US...

39:42.171 --> 39:45.340
AND FOR HELPING US
TO FIND OUR WAY BACK HOME.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.509
[GRACE CRIES]

39:47.676 --> 39:53.848
LORD, WE'D LIKE TO ASK
FOR A SPECIAL BLESSING
FOR A DEAR FRIEND OF OURS

39:54.016 --> 39:57.727
WHO NEEDS YOUR HELP
AND YOUR STRENGTH.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.604
SHOW HIM THE WAY, LORD.

39:59.772 --> 40:00.855
AMEN.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.857
AMEN.
AMEN.

40:03.025 --> 40:05.652
EVERYBODY
SERVE YOURSELVES.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.406
NO, THANK YOU.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.658
IF WE'RE GOING TO
GET OUR TOWN BACK
ON ITS FEET,

40:11.826 --> 40:14.452
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
ALL OUR STRENGTH.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.955
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT MR. HANSON, BUT--

40:17.123 --> 40:18.373
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.874
I TELL YOU,
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
A LOT OF STRENGTH

40:20.042 --> 40:21.668
JUST TO GET
THAT MILL STARTED.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.171
I'M AFRAID HANSON
ISN'T GOING TO EVEN
TRY IT, CHARLES.

40:25.339 --> 40:26.381
THEN WE WILL.

40:26.549 --> 40:27.882
TOWNS
LIKE SLEEPY EYE
AND MOONEY

40:28.050 --> 40:29.551
HAVE GROWN A LOT.
THEY'RE GOING TO
NEED FLOUR.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.386
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
GET RICH BY IT,

40:31.554 --> 40:32.971
BUT AT LEAST IT'LL
GIVE THE FARMERS

40:33.139 --> 40:34.639
A MARKET FOR THEIR
CROPS, GIVE THEM
A REASON TO PLANT.

40:34.807 --> 40:35.974
MAYBE SO.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.309
WHAT KIND OF CONDITION
IS THE SCHOOLHOUSE IN?

40:38.477 --> 40:41.396
IT'S A MESS, BUT
THE BUILDING'S STILL GOOD.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.983
I THINK WITH SOME
ELBOW GREASE AND A COUPLE
NEW COATS OF PAINT,

40:45.151 --> 40:46.568
BE AS GOOD AS NEW.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.653
FIRST OF ALL,
WE'VE GOT TO GET AHOLD
OF THE NEIGHBORS,

40:48.821 --> 40:50.405
LET THEM KNOW WHAT
WE'RE PLANNING TO DO.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.240
LET THEM KNOW
WE HAVE A SCHOOL AGAIN.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.284
WE DO?

40:54.452 --> 40:58.621
IT ONLY TAKES
STUDENTS AND A TEACHER,
AND WE HAVE BOTH.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.415
Charles: ALL RIGHT,
WE DO HAVE A START.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.292
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
OF THE OLD FRIENDS
ARE STILL AROUND HERE,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.085
BUT THE SOONER
WE GET THE WORD OUT
TO THEM, THE BETTER.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.920
I KNOW THE CAULDER
FAMILY'S STILL IN TOWN.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.464
I SAW THEIR WAGON
THIS MORNING.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.924
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE FINISH EATING,
WE GET STARTED?

41:10.092 --> 41:11.801
RIGHT.
Alice: WRONG.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.471
BEFORE YOU START FIXING UP
THE TOWN, YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOUR OWN HOUSE.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.015
I CAN'T EVEN GET
TO THE BARN UNTIL YOU
CUT BACK THAT MUSTARD.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.725
Jonathan: YES, DEAR.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.935
ALBERT AND I CAN
TELL FOLKS, TOO.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.437
I'LL GO
WITH YOU.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.855
Jonathan: WRONG.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.566
WE GOT WEEDS TO CUT, SON.
I'LL BE NEEDING YOUR HELP.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.359
YES, SIR.

41:28.527 --> 41:31.279
Charles: IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET
THE WORD TO EVERYBODY.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.781
TODAY'S TUESDAY.
LET'S SAY EVERYBODY
THAT WANTS TO HELP,

41:33.949 --> 41:35.325
MEET US IN TOWN
THURSDAY MORNING.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.286
Caroline: I WONDER
IF WE CAN GET WORD
TO REVEREND ALDEN.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.872
IT WOULD BE SO GOOD
FOR THE TOWN TO HAVE
PROPER SERVICES AGAIN.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.958
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
HE MUST STILL BE PREACHING
IN SLEEPY EYE ONCE A MONTH.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.294
NELS IS GOING
IN THERE TOMORROW.
I'LL HAVE HIM CHECK AROUND.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.171
THANK YOU.

41:48.339 --> 41:52.342
Alice: THAT'S ENOUGH PLAN.
NOW EAT UP ALL THIS FISH
BEFORE IT DRIES UP.

41:52.510 --> 41:56.930
Jonathan: I TELL YOU ONE THING.
I THINK I GOT MY APPETITE BACK.

42:49.775 --> 42:51.985
Laura: HEY, YOU GUYS!
YOU GUYS!

42:52.152 --> 42:55.238
EVERYBODY'S COMING
INTO TOWN THURSDAY MORNING
TO HELP CLEAN IT UP.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.531
CAN YOU COME?

42:56.699 --> 42:58.199
YEAH!
WE'LL BE THERE.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.701
OK. SEE YOU THURSDAY!

42:59.868 --> 43:01.578
BYE!

43:01.745 --> 43:03.871
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME, INGALLS.

43:04.039 --> 43:08.126
MAKING DO, SURVIVING--
THAT'S ALL FOLKS CARE
ABOUT AROUND HERE.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.169
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU, MILES.

43:10.337 --> 43:12.589
YOU WERE ALWAYS
PROUD OF THIS TOWN.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.090
THAT'S RIGHT--WAS.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.302
YOU CAN BE
PROUD OF IT AGAIN
IF YOU JUST HELP US.

43:17.469 --> 43:19.971
I WORKED FOR 18 YEARS
ON THIS FARM.

43:20.139 --> 43:24.434
TOOK ME 15 YEARS TO SAVE
ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY MY SARAH
SOME STORE-BOUGHT FURNITURE.

43:24.602 --> 43:28.062
TOOK 15 MINUTES TO SELL IT
TO PAY MY TAXES.

43:28.230 --> 43:31.399
I'M NOT PRETENDING
THINGS AREN'T BAD.
I KNOW THEY ARE.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.818
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT FURNITURE MEANT
TO MY SARAH?

43:33.986 --> 43:37.572
WAITING ALL THESE YEARS
FOR A DREAM TO COME TRUE,

43:37.740 --> 43:41.451
THEN IT'S JUST TAKEN AWAY
JUST LIKE THAT.

43:43.746 --> 43:46.247
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT'S DONE.

43:46.415 --> 43:48.625
IT MADE HER
AN OLD WOMAN.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.418
THAT'S WHAT IT DONE.

43:50.586 --> 43:55.965
NOW YOU'RE STARTING
THIS TALK ABOUT SCHOOL,
CHURCH MEETINGS AGAIN.

44:00.429 --> 44:03.264
IF THERE'S A GOD...

44:03.432 --> 44:06.517
AND I'M SAYING IF...

44:06.685 --> 44:10.438
HE DON'T GIVE A HOOT
ABOUT US.

44:10.606 --> 44:12.732
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT,
MILES.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.692
I DON'T?

44:14.860 --> 44:16.986
YOU COME WITH ME.

44:32.920 --> 44:38.007
SARAH, MR. INGALLS COME BY
FOR A VISIT.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.513
MRS. CAULDER.

44:56.235 --> 44:59.570
YESTERDAY WAS
MY WIFE'S BIRTHDAY,
MR. INGALLS.

45:00.989 --> 45:03.658
SHE WAS 45 YEARS OLD.

45:07.830 --> 45:10.665
I THINK IT'S BEST
THAT YOU GO NOW.

46:00.340 --> 46:03.384
YOU MUST BE DEAD-TIRED,
YOUNG LADY.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.094
I SURE AM, MA.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.555
YOU COVERED A LOT
OF MILES TODAY.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.016
I WISH I FELT BETTER
ABOUT IT.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.434
YOU DID YOUR BEST.

46:11.602 --> 46:14.854
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO FOLKS.

46:15.022 --> 46:19.400
LIKE MR. MORGAN--
HE WAS SO PROUD OF OUR TOWN.

46:19.568 --> 46:23.905
I WAS SURE HE WOULD HELP,
BUT ALL HE SAID WAS THAT
HE WANTED TO BE ALONE.

46:24.072 --> 46:26.449
SOME PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO HELP.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.493
WELL, ALL THE KIDS
WANTED TO HELP.

46:28.660 --> 46:32.163
EVEN BOBBY JOE BEAN
WAS HAPPY THAT WE WERE
GOING TO HAVE SCHOOL AGAIN,

46:32.331 --> 46:33.790
AND HE HATED SCHOOL.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.708
A LOT OF TIMES
WE THINK WE DON'T
LIKE SOMETHING

46:35.876 --> 46:37.919
TILL WE DON'T HAVE IT
FOR A WHILE.

46:38.086 --> 46:41.422
YEAH...LIKE WATERMELON--

46:41.590 --> 46:44.425
YOU EAT IT ALL SUMMER LONG
UNTIL YOU HATE IT,

46:44.593 --> 46:48.262
AND THEN IN THE WINTER,
ALL YOU DO IS DREAM
ABOUT IT.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.722
I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.349
[HORSES APPROACHING]

46:51.517 --> 46:53.643

46:55.312 --> 46:58.773
I SURE HOPE HE DID
BETTER WITH THE GROWN-UPS
THAN I DID.

46:58.941 --> 47:02.652
WELL, YOU WON'T FIND
OUT TILL THE MORNING.

47:04.446 --> 47:05.363

WHY DON'T YOU STAY
AWAKE FOR A WHILE?

47:25.592 --> 47:27.301
WHY SHOULD I?
I'M TIRED.

47:27.469 --> 47:32.056
WELL, YOU SEE,
IF YOU'D STAY AWAKE
A LITTLE WHILE,

47:32.224 --> 47:33.432
I COULD
GO TO SLEEP FAST,

47:33.600 --> 47:35.476
AND I WOULDN'T HEAR
YOU SNORE.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.645
I CAN GO TO SLEEP
REAL QUICK

47:37.813 --> 47:40.314

THINK ABOUT STUFF
TO KEEP YOU AWAKE,

AWAKE.

HI. HOW'D IT GO?

48:14.308 --> 48:17.226
I DON'T KNOW.
EVERYBODY'S SO BITTER.

48:17.394 --> 48:20.021
THEY BLAME
THE GOVERNMENT FOR NOT
STOPPING THE RAILROADS.

48:20.188 --> 48:21.939
THEY BLAME THE GRANGE.

48:22.107 --> 48:24.775
THEY EVEN BLAME GOD
FOR LETTING IT HAPPEN.

48:24.943 --> 48:27.361
IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD
TO BLAME ANYONE.

48:27.529 --> 48:29.989
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US
ALL TO CHANGE IT.

48:30.157 --> 48:33.576
I JUST DON'T THINK
ANYBODY CARES.

DID THEY ALL SAY NO?

48:35.704 --> 48:37.413
WELL, THE ONES
WHO DIDN'T SAY NO

48:37.581 --> 48:39.040
DIDN'T SAY YES, EITHER.

48:39.207 --> 48:41.542
THEY'D THINK ABOUT IT.

48:41.710 --> 48:46.130
I GUESS WE'LL KNOW
COME THURSDAY MORNING.

49:03.357 --> 49:07.693
YOU'VE HARDLY TOUCHED
YOUR SUPPER, YOU OLD GOAT.

49:07.861 --> 49:10.196
I WASN'T HUNGRY.

49:10.364 --> 49:11.989
HMM.

49:15.744 --> 49:18.996
NOT A VERY GOOD REFLECTION
ON MY COOKING.

HEAT UP THE SOUP AGAIN?

49:58.912 --> 50:02.123
CHARLES IS A DREAMER.

50:02.290 --> 50:05.292
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A DREAMER.

WEREN'T YOU A DREAMER

50-ODD YEARS AGO?

50:11.341 --> 50:14.719
I WAS YOUNG THEN.

50:14.886 --> 50:18.055
I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER.

50:20.851 --> 50:23.310
CHARLES SHOULD KNOW
BETTER.

50:23.478 --> 50:26.480
YEAH, AND YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY BETTER THAN TO
JUST LIE THERE.

50:26.648 --> 50:28.149

YOUR EXERCISES.

50:28.316 --> 50:32.194

IF YOU DON'T DO
YOUR EXERCISES.

LIE THERE, FEEL SORRY
FOR YOURSELF?

51:09.357 --> 51:11.317
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN.

51:11.485 --> 51:15.529
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO LISTEN.

GETTING TO BE, DOC?

52:02.452 --> 52:03.786

BEEN RIGHT AFTER ALL.

DO IT WITHOUT THEM, PA.
WE CAN DO IT.

52:20.262 --> 52:21.637

YOU ALWAYS SAY
A PERSON CAN DO
ANYTHING HE WANTS TO

52:24.432 --> 52:26.809
ONCE HE SETS
HIS MIND TO IT.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.936

Laura, voice-over:
4 MONTHS LATER,

1:12:25.758 --> 1:12:29.093
MR. HANSON PASSED AWAY
QUIETLY IN HIS SLEEP.

1:12:29.261 --> 1:12:30.970
HE DIED HAPPY, DOC SAID,

1:12:31.138 --> 1:12:34.974
BECAUSE HE KNEW THE TOWN
HE LOVED WOULD LIVE ON,

1:12:35.142 --> 1:12:39.395
AND SO WOULD THE NAME AND MEMORY
OF MR. HANSON.
