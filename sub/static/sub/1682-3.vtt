WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.464
Kids, your uncle Barney
had been called

00:02.535 --> 00:04.127
a lot of names over the years.

00:04.204 --> 00:05.193
Jerk!

00:06.139 --> 00:08.266
Bastard!

00:08.375 --> 00:09.740
Barack Obama, Jr?

00:09.809 --> 00:10.935
Mmm-hmm.

00:11.478 --> 00:14.003
And, yes. We can.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.878
<i>But there's one name none of us</i>
<i>ever expected to hear him called.</i>

00:16.950 --> 00:20.078
Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend.

00:20.153 --> 00:23.281
I've said it, like, 100 times.
It still sounds weird to say.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.223
Well, anything sounds weird
if you say it 100 times.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.488
Bowl.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.028
Bowl.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.156
Bowl.

00:32.465 --> 00:34.433
- But other than that, things are good?
- Bowl.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.024
- Bowl.
- I don't know.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.933
- I think Barney's been single for too long.
- Bowl.

00:38.004 --> 00:39.972
Like, the other night,
I wake up at 4:00 a. m...

00:42.642 --> 00:44.803
Barney, are you awake?

00:45.311 --> 00:46.972
Barney?

00:48.948 --> 00:53.146
Barney. This is not a one-night stand.
We're dating. Come back to bed.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.888
- Bowl. Bowl.
- That's happened three times.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.552
And it's not just that, it's other things.

01:04.631 --> 01:06.496
Hey. What's wrong?

01:06.566 --> 01:09.228
It was just one thing after another
at work today,

01:09.302 --> 01:12.328
and then I found out my aunt's
in the hospital.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.532
I'm just...
I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just...

01:15.909 --> 01:18.969
What you need to do
is talk through this stuff.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.569
Thanks.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.478
And then,
once you're off the phone with Lily,

01:22.549 --> 01:25.814
I'll be down in the bar
ready to have sex. Okay?

01:27.220 --> 01:28.380
Bowl.

01:28.688 --> 01:32.317
Look, I'm not the touchy-feeliest
person in the world, but,

01:32.392 --> 01:33.723
a little more effort would be nice.

01:33.793 --> 01:35.192
- Bowl. Bowl.
- I understand.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.559
I guess, in a lot of ways,
Barney doesn't stack up.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.892
- Bowl. Bowl.
- I mean, you've had some

01:38.965 --> 01:40.227
pretty incredible boyfriends.

01:40.300 --> 01:44.737
Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.

01:45.538 --> 01:48.336
- No, that's not it. I don't know.
- Bowl. Bowl.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.343
- Maybe he just doesn't have it in him.
- Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.311
- Maybe this whole thing's a big mistake.
- Bowl.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.405
Bowl?

01:55.715 --> 01:58.206
- She really said that?
- And she meant it.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.447
Trust me. I dated Robin for a year.
If you don't want to lose her,

02:01.521 --> 02:03.113
you gotta try a little harder.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.282
Be more attentive
to where she is emotionally.

02:05.358 --> 02:07.451
You know, just be present.

02:07.594 --> 02:11.360
Yes, totally. Yeah.
Only thing, and this is just me,

02:11.431 --> 02:14.366
I like my testicles attached to my body,
rather than rolling around

02:14.434 --> 02:18.370
next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse.
Stinson out!

02:18.438 --> 02:20.099
<i>But then, a funny thing happened.</i>

02:20.807 --> 02:23.241
<i>Over the next couple of weeks,</i>
<i>Barney was thoughtful,</i>

02:23.309 --> 02:25.937
<i>considerate, sweet.</i>

02:26.412 --> 02:30.872
<i>In short, the perfect boyfriend,</i>
<i>which, to Robin, meant only one thing.</i>

02:30.950 --> 02:32.383
- He's cheating on me.
- What?

02:32.452 --> 02:35.012
Why else would he buy me flowers?
He's getting some on the side.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.555
Come on, Robin.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.148
Barney's not the type of guy who would...
Go on.

02:39.225 --> 02:41.216
Plus, he keeps saying he's working late.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.421
But when I call his office,
they say he left hours ago.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.963
Well, that doesn't prove anything.

02:45.031 --> 02:48.626
Yes. Proof. Good word.
I'm glad you brought that up.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.465
Barney's briefcase.
He forgot it here this morning.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.501
And what do you plan on doing with it?

02:53.573 --> 02:57.634
We. We, you and I, are going to
open it up and look for evidence.

02:58.044 --> 03:00.342
Ted probably has a sledgehammer
around here somewhere.

03:00.413 --> 03:04.440
No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.953
Robin Scherbatsky is many things.
Friend, confidant,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.319
occasional guest star
in some confusing dreams

03:10.390 --> 03:12.915
that remind me
a woman's sexuality is a moving target.

03:12.992 --> 03:17.554
But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch.
Let go.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.930
Hey, I've been down in the basement
storage area going through all the stuff

03:22.001 --> 03:24.595
that Lily and I left behind
when we moved out. I'm sorry, Robin.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.070
We should've cleared it out
for you much sooner.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.538
There's a basement storage area?

03:27.607 --> 03:31.168
You're not upset. Good.
Baby, guess what I found.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.777
- That's great, honey.
- What the hell is that?

03:40.853 --> 03:44.619
Marshall got it in college.
He used it as a nightstand for years.

03:44.691 --> 03:48.183
Until we found out
that Lily was allergic to barrel resin.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.819
- Barrel resin?
- Just go with it.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.625
So, you need a hand throwing it out?

03:51.698 --> 03:55.190
No, I'm not...
I'm not just going to throw her out, okay?

03:55.268 --> 03:57.065
Mabel's like family.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.135
So, what are you going to do with Mabel?

04:00.206 --> 04:02.868
I want to give her away
to a lucky new owner.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.604
- Do you know anyone?
- Yeah, let me think.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.805
Do I know any rodeo clowns?

04:08.514 --> 04:09.708
That's weird, I do.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.682
But even Lenny wouldn't go
near that mess.

04:11.884 --> 04:16.149
Well, he's not going to have the chance
because I am putting old Mabel

04:16.221 --> 04:17.620
in the Bermuda Triangle.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.382
<i>"The Bermuda Triangle"</i>
<i>was the name we'd given</i>

04:20.459 --> 04:23.952
<i>years earlier to the curb</i>
<i>right in front of our building.</i>

04:24.764 --> 04:28.063
<i>Whenever we wanted to give something</i>
<i>away, we'd put it right there.</i>

04:32.305 --> 04:34.466
<i>It was uncanny.</i>

04:34.974 --> 04:36.703
This is so exciting.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.676
Right now, there's someone out there
who has no idea

04:38.778 --> 04:42.077
that tonight
they're going home with just...

04:42.315 --> 04:43.942
Just the best barrel.

04:44.017 --> 04:47.145
Well, let's just hope they're not allergic
to barrel resin like Lily here.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.915
Be cool, baby. Damn.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.289
- See you, sweetie. Good luck.
- Bye, babe.

04:53.693 --> 04:56.628
- Now, can we please get out of here?
- Yeah. I'll grab my coat.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.630
Oops.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.068
A college notebook?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.197
Oh, my God, he's cheating on me
with some college girl.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.901
I knew there was a skank,
but I thought she'd at least be dumb.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.945
"Birthday, July 23.

05:14.013 --> 05:15.742
"Favorite hockey team,
the Vancouver Canucks.

05:15.815 --> 05:19.046
"Age 29, but tells people that she's 26."

05:19.118 --> 05:23.487
Oh, my God, these are notes about me,
or some 29-year-old version of me.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.383
I hope I'm not too late!

05:26.459 --> 05:29.360
I want to see the look of joy
on the new owner's face!

05:34.600 --> 05:35.931
She's still there!

05:37.003 --> 05:39.904
Okay, Mabel, let's find you a new home.

05:40.139 --> 05:41.629
Here comes a guy!

05:41.708 --> 05:45.200
And he...
He just walked, walked right on by it.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.509
He's probably rushing home
to get a handcart or something.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.515
Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.948
What are you guys doing
with Barney's secret Robin notebook?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.087
Let me rephrase that.

05:59.826 --> 06:03.262
Did you two ladies lose some weight?

06:03.796 --> 06:05.696
What do you know about this, Marshall?

06:05.765 --> 06:08.757
Why would Barney have a notebook
full of information about me?

06:09.135 --> 06:10.227
Well...

06:10.303 --> 06:11.930
<i>The truth was</i>

06:12.004 --> 06:16.134
<i>Barney was taking a night school class</i>
<i>taught by me.</i>

06:16.376 --> 06:18.708
Welcome to Robin 101.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:37.764 --> 06:40.198
Why is Ted teaching a class about me?

06:40.533 --> 06:42.694
It all started a few weeks ago.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.665
...rather than rolling around
next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.228
Stinson out!

06:52.011 --> 06:54.241
Stinson back in.

06:54.580 --> 06:59.142
Say, hypothetically,
I did want to change who I am

06:59.218 --> 07:02.949
to become a better boyfriend to Robin,
which I do not,

07:03.723 --> 07:06.021
what kind of changes
are we talking about?

07:06.092 --> 07:08.993
Why... There's just so much
you need to know about her.

07:09.629 --> 07:14.089
Okay, for starters,
don't ever cry in front of her.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.828
- Okay.
- And whatever you do,

07:17.904 --> 07:20.600
don't cry in front of her four times.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.665
Hey, guys. What you talking about?

07:23.743 --> 07:25.370
- Fantasy football.
- Fantasy football.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.444
They realized they couldn't talk about
this stuff at the bar,

07:29.515 --> 07:32.814
and since you live with Ted,
they had to find someplace safe.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.080
So, Ted's classroom.

07:35.354 --> 07:39.017
"How To Date Robin Scherbatsky."
Lesson one.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.116
Now, even though she puts up
a tough exterior,

07:41.194 --> 07:44.595
- what Robin really wants, deep down...
- I'm bored.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.123
You said you wanted my help.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.258
Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?

07:48.534 --> 07:51.367
- We did that already.
- No, like, really big boobs.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.473
No. Look, I need this, too.
I've only been a professor a few weeks.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.600
Being up here, it's...
It's good practice for me.

07:57.677 --> 07:58.871
Can we have class outside?

07:58.945 --> 08:01.812
No. What Robin really wants,
deep down is...

08:04.050 --> 08:07.281
- Barney.
- What? I'm tweeting about you.

08:07.753 --> 08:08.981
You should be flattered.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.615
How do you spell "blah-blah-blah"?
"H's" or no?

08:12.124 --> 08:15.890
Wow, you were just, like, the worst
student in the world, weren't you?

08:15.962 --> 08:20.331
They said I had A-D... Something.
Can we have class outside?

08:20.399 --> 08:24.335
Barney, I'm only gonna say this once,
so listen up.

08:24.770 --> 08:28.672
I love you and I love Robin.
And I want to make this work.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.175
So, if you give me
a few weeks of attention,

08:31.244 --> 08:35.374
I could give you a lifetime of happiness.
Can you do that for me?

08:35.448 --> 08:39.214
Do you think I should get <i>Sports</i>
<i>Illustrated</i> for 70% off the cover price?

08:39.284 --> 08:40.479
Can we have class outside?

08:41.320 --> 08:44.255
I gotta find a way to reach this kid.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.248
"Class number two."

08:46.325 --> 08:50.625
"Top 10 Robin Scherbatsky
Facial Expressions and Their Meaning."

08:50.997 --> 08:56.094
Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale,
queasy expression, suggesting nausea.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.796
- What do these mean?
- You guys just had sex?

09:01.574 --> 09:02.939
Wasn't me.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.773
Dude! I worked really hard
on these slides, okay?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.574
- Can we just...
- Okay.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.546
This look is hunger.
If you ever see Robin looking like this,

09:11.617 --> 09:14.279
get some food in her quick,
or one of two things will happen.

09:14.353 --> 09:17.516
One. Weird, out-of-context laughter.

09:18.758 --> 09:22.626
Or two. Spontaneously falling
asleep in strange places.

09:23.596 --> 09:28.431
But the most important facial
expression of all?

09:30.937 --> 09:31.995
That's a building.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.462
Oh.

09:33.539 --> 09:34.938
That's for my class.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.168
The Flatiron Building. Fun story about it.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.041
It was designed by
Chicago's Daniel Burnham

09:40.112 --> 09:42.603
in the Beaux-Arts style.
This architectural gem...

09:42.682 --> 09:44.843
- Dude!
- Right.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.943
The most important
facial expression of all.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.659
Whoa.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.760
Flared nostril ridges.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.730
Wide, unblinking eyes.

10:00.900 --> 10:05.701
If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run.

10:06.505 --> 10:10.942
And don't take a picture of it.
She will punch you.

10:11.410 --> 10:17.610
And you will cry
for the third time that night.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.750
Which brings us to an important point.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.252
Defusing the bomb.

10:27.693 --> 10:31.129
"Defusing the bomb"?
What does that even mean?

10:31.197 --> 10:34.098
"Three Topics to Distract Robin
From Being Mad at You."

10:34.166 --> 10:36.430
Distract me? That is so condescending.

10:36.502 --> 10:38.299
These guys are really starting to
piss me off!

10:38.371 --> 10:42.307
"Immediately switch the conversation
to one of the following,

10:42.375 --> 10:45.344
"unless you want Robin
to start throwing her shoes."

10:51.183 --> 10:53.549
What? That's not distracting.

10:53.619 --> 10:56.588
That's just talking about the story
of a scrappy little underdog team

10:56.656 --> 10:58.851
that prevailed
despite very shaky goaltending

10:58.924 --> 11:01.586
and, frankly,
the declining skills of Trevor Linden.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.294
You have to clean your gun.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.394
My uncle had a filthy, old shotgun,

11:12.471 --> 11:14.302
blew both his thumbs off
trying to shoot a beaver.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.897
You... You want to distract someone,

11:15.975 --> 11:18.273
make them watch my uncle
try to eat corn on the cob.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.241
Did you know that before intercourse,

11:26.318 --> 11:29.845
the male and female emperor penguins
bow to each other?

11:30.189 --> 11:33.352
"Mr. Penguin." "Mrs. Penguin."

11:33.426 --> 11:36.395
Oh, God, silly penguins, acting all fancy.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.796
What were we talking about?

11:40.266 --> 11:42.359
Uh-oh, looks like we got a taker.

11:43.402 --> 11:46.303
Come on, dude. You know you want to.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.840
A guy like you, beard, no mustache.

11:48.908 --> 11:51.706
You're exactly the kind of guy
who could use a sweet barrel.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.571
Do it.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.579
No. That's not a fire hydrant!

11:57.149 --> 12:00.118
For shame, sir. For shame!

12:00.186 --> 12:03.644
I bet you couldn't even grow
a mustache if you wanted to!

12:03.723 --> 12:05.020
Neither can you, sweetie.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.991
Well, he doesn't know that, baby! God!

12:08.994 --> 12:11.554
Ted's only teaching Barney
horrible things about me.

12:11.630 --> 12:15.532
I don't know. Check this out.
This is actually kind of sweet.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.163
Now, we all know Robin's not
what you'd call "touchy-feely."

12:20.239 --> 12:23.265
She doesn't say, "I love you,"
like a normal person.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.106
Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head,

12:26.178 --> 12:29.978
give you a little smile and say,
"You're an idiot."

12:30.716 --> 12:32.741
- "You're an idiot"?
- Yup.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.613
If she tells you you're an idiot,
you are a lucky man.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.082
And if she does say, "I love you,"

12:38.157 --> 12:40.125
she's already broken up with you
in her mind.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.428
I think it's nice
that Ted knows you that well.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.623
Yeah, well, too bad
it's next to a page entitled...

12:45.898 --> 12:48.833
"Robin Scherbatsky's
Surprising Erogenous Zones."

12:50.002 --> 12:53.335
Right knee. Ticklish.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.138
Left knee.

12:56.709 --> 12:57.835
Does lefty like that?

12:59.678 --> 13:03.307
Oh, yeah. Lefty like that.

13:04.550 --> 13:08.281
I can't believe I'm taking sexual advice
from Ted Mosby.

13:08.687 --> 13:12.817
That's like taking fashion advice from...
Well, Ted Mosby.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.027
Here's a good one.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.028
"Top Five Things
Never to Do Around Robin."

13:20.166 --> 13:24.432
Three. Never, ever play
the "Guess Who" game with her.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.662
What do you mean?

13:27.706 --> 13:28.730
Guess who?

13:30.709 --> 13:32.836
It's me! It's me! It's me!

13:33.379 --> 13:37.076
Number four. Unless you want to see it
80 times a day for the next month,

13:37.149 --> 13:42.109
never show Robin a YouTube clip of an
animal playing a musical instrument.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.387
Barney!

13:46.025 --> 13:47.424
Do you have a problem with this class?

13:47.493 --> 13:50.894
Yeah, it's boring as hell
and I'm not learning anything.

13:51.130 --> 13:54.429
Well, maybe the problem is your attitude.
You're not listening to a word I say.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.592
Uh-huh.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.832
Can you hear this, Professor?
Or should I turn it up for you?

14:00.139 --> 14:03.540
<i>It may not have been</i>
<i>a thumbs-up, kids.</i>

14:03.976 --> 14:05.409
So, you think
you're not learning anything, huh?

14:07.446 --> 14:11.177
- Okay. Pop quiz.
- What...

14:11.250 --> 14:13.684
When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind
of chocolate should you get her?

14:13.752 --> 14:16.152
- Trick question. Get her butterscotch.
- Correct! Why?

14:16.222 --> 14:18.884
Butterscotch is to Canadian women
what chocolate is to American women.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.688
Correct! What is Robin's dream job?

14:21.760 --> 14:24.320
To become the most successful
female TV journalist of all time.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.864
Correct! And if she achieves that,
will she truly be happy?

14:26.932 --> 14:29.799
No! Robin's deep-seated need
for attention can be traced back

14:29.902 --> 14:31.301
to her father's emotional distance,

14:31.370 --> 14:32.997
and no amount of success
will ever make up

14:33.072 --> 14:35.404
for what she truly needs,
which is six simple words from her dad,

14:35.474 --> 14:38.375
- "Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?"
- Yes!

14:41.547 --> 14:43.572
But I guess you're right.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.778
You haven't learned anything.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.787
Sorry to have wasted your time.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.216
"O Captain! My Captain!"

15:00.266 --> 15:04.896
- How good was <i>Dead Poets Society?</i>
- I know, right? The end? Tears.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.070
Okay, can I just say
that my deepest need in life

15:08.140 --> 15:10.938
is not to have my father say,
"I am proud of you, eh?"

15:11.010 --> 15:13.308
- Then why are you crying right now?
- I'm not crying.

15:13.379 --> 15:16.815
Sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch?

15:16.882 --> 15:19.214
No, stop it.

15:22.888 --> 15:26.722
Wait a second. It says here that
the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.589
- So?
- That's right now.

15:29.728 --> 15:33.425
Now, as you can see,
well over 50% of the blankets

15:33.499 --> 15:37.196
have been dragged onto her side.
Make no mistake.

15:37.269 --> 15:43.367
Robin Scherbatsky is a classic,
textbook cover hog.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.945
- Any questions?
- Yeah, I have one.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.503
Yes, Robin?

15:57.990 --> 16:01.983
Flared nostril ridges.
Wide, unblinking eyes.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.050
Uh-oh.

16:03.162 --> 16:07.360
I got this.
So, emperor penguins. Crazy, huh?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.599
What the hell
do you two think you're doing?

16:11.670 --> 16:13.695
Marshall, did you sell us out?

16:13.772 --> 16:18.641
I was vulnerable, okay.
I said goodbye to a very dear friend today.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.508
Dude, it's a barrel!

16:20.746 --> 16:22.509
Aw. You're giving Mabel away?

16:22.581 --> 16:24.572
Okay, I have... I have so many questions.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.517
Why would you do this?
What were you thinking?

16:27.586 --> 16:29.019
Who the hell is that guy?

16:30.222 --> 16:32.918
That's Shin-Ya.
He's sort of been auditing the class.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.452
Auditing?

16:34.526 --> 16:36.687
Well, I tried to explain to him
it wasn't a real class,

16:36.762 --> 16:38.525
but I don't think he speaks much English.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.459
On the bright side, he came in handy
standing in for you

16:41.533 --> 16:43.194
during the role-playing exercises.

16:43.268 --> 16:47.295
Wait. You did role-playing exercises
where I was played by Shin-Ya?

16:52.544 --> 16:54.239
You know, I can't believe you, Ted.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.338
You actually think
you're some kind of an expert on me?

16:56.415 --> 16:59.043
Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!

16:59.251 --> 17:01.219
- Kiss ass.
- You know, half the stuff

17:01.286 --> 17:03.015
in this notebook is patently wrong.

17:03.088 --> 17:05.021
Really? Name one wrong thing.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.887
"Robin Scherbatsky's
Surprising Erogenous Zones."

17:07.960 --> 17:10.223
Let me clear something up for you, Ted.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.922
Does lefty like that?

17:12.998 --> 17:15.626
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

17:16.402 --> 17:19.496
- Don't want to leave out righty.
- Oh, no.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.368
The right one's ticklish, I guess.

17:23.509 --> 17:26.637
But the left one, yeah,
I'm glad you're back there.

17:26.712 --> 17:31.843
Because that is just some
sweet, sweet loving.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.316
Noted.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.886
- That was a lie?
- We had just started dating.

17:35.954 --> 17:36.978
I was being nice.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.884
And you. You know,

17:39.958 --> 17:42.358
I got it into my head this week
that you were cheating on me.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.828
I even broke open your briefcase
to look for evidence.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.333
That is a huge violation of my privacy!

17:51.937 --> 17:53.029
Go on.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.938
You know, in a way, I was right.
You cheated.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.205
You can't get some crib sheet
on dating me. That's not how it works.

17:59.278 --> 18:03.840
If we can't figure out how to be
with each other in a real, honest way,

18:03.916 --> 18:06.441
I don't see the point of even trying.

18:20.199 --> 18:23.259
- What do you want?
- Look.

18:23.335 --> 18:25.394
All that stuff I told Barney,

18:25.471 --> 18:29.430
it was personal between you and me.
I'm really sorry.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.169
I guess I'm impressed
by how much you remembered.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.309
It's funny.

18:36.381 --> 18:39.475
When you date someone,
it's like you're taking one long course

18:39.551 --> 18:41.644
in who that person is
and then when you break up,

18:41.720 --> 18:43.449
all that stuff becomes useless.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.622
It's the emotional equivalent
of an English degree.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.560
I guess I just liked the idea
of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky

18:50.629 --> 18:52.119
knowledge to good use, you know?

18:53.098 --> 18:56.693
Well, since you know me pretty well,

18:57.236 --> 18:59.704
am I fooling myself
with this whole Barney thing?

19:00.239 --> 19:01.831
I don't know.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.040
I will say this, though.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.669
I've seen Barney work very hard
to get women.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.575
I've seen him work very hard
to get rid of women.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.643
I've never seen him work this hard
to keep one around.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.282
I was going to give him an A.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.984
Well, B+.
Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.458
Hey. Before you say anything,

19:26.532 --> 19:29.092
I am done with this
stupid Robin 101, okay?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.329
Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.599
But there's...

19:38.677 --> 19:40.474
There's something that
I did want to say to you.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.139
Robin, I have been with a lot of women.

19:45.217 --> 19:48.152
Blondes, brunettes, redheads.

19:49.021 --> 19:53.685
Big boobs, small boobs, medium boobs,

19:53.759 --> 19:56.728
some boobs that were big,
but kind of in a bad way.

19:57.062 --> 20:01.260
The point is... Boobs that pointed in
opposite... The point is...

20:04.136 --> 20:06.297
I'm really scared
that you're going to dump me

20:06.371 --> 20:09.306
and that's why I did this and I'm sorry.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.638
You're an idiot.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.448
- You know...
- Hmm?

20:23.522 --> 20:27.288
That notebook does contain
a lot of personal info,

20:27.359 --> 20:31.523
- and I think it has my home address.
- And your work address.

20:33.532 --> 20:34.897
Whoa.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.064
Hey, guys! If you don't want
the barrel, can you sit somewhere else?

20:38.136 --> 20:41.572
'Cause you're scaring away
potential takers.

20:46.478 --> 20:50.574
Designed by Chicago's Daniel Burnham
in the Beaux-Arts style,

20:50.649 --> 20:54.050
this architectural gem was
the first of its kind...

20:54.119 --> 20:55.882
- Professor Mosby?
- Yes, Susan?

20:55.954 --> 20:57.854
That's a woman drinking beer
on the toilet.

21:00.125 --> 21:03.822
Right. That...
That was Daniel Burnham's wife.

21:03.895 --> 21:07.456
She was a troubled, troubled woman.
We are moving on.
