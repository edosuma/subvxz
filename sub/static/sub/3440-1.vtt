00:21.320 --> 00:23.948
Open this door right now.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.585
Open this door.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.425
Mary, get back.

00:39.280 --> 00:42.351
No, Mary. No.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.744
- No.
- No!

01:30.880 --> 01:32.959
Don't...

01:32.960 --> 01:35.303
don't play with fate boy.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.268
Nothing good will come.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.879
I know you more into cars, Jake,
but look at that right there.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.159
That's a dang
Rembrandt right there.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.239
- See?
- Oh yeah.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.439
That's beautiful, Catfish.
Yeah.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.989
Not really into guns, man.
More of a lover, not a fighter.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.839
There you go.
That's the trouble with you.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.661
Thinking you gel to choose.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.830
Hey.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.959
Where is Cobb?

02:49.960 --> 02:54.909
I think he's fixing a forklift.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.439
You hand checked that truck to
Iberia this morning, right?

03:18.440 --> 03:19.879
Yeah. Gill, it's in the computer.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.799
Don't want to hear about
anymore short loads.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.159
Look, Mr. Gillespie, I got these
two loads that I'm trying to get

03:24.160 --> 03:26.519
ready for freight, and then I got two
more that I'm trying to prep, man.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.319
Jake, when I promoted
you to shift supervisor,

03:29.320 --> 03:32.599
it's 'cause you said you could
handle the extra responsibility.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.759
Now, if you can't, tell me.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.599
'Cause it's my ass on the line.
Not yours.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.148
Gill, we're good.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.146
Hey.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.306
It's my ass on the line, not yours.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.919
That guy promoted me just to shovel
more of his work on me, ya know?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.239
Just another day of
missing visiting hours.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.199
That's all that means.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.479
How is that red hot
mama of yours anyway?

04:00.480 --> 04:02.239
That's gross.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.708
When you talk about my
mom like that, it's weird.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.239
You know, man, she got
another round of chemo,

04:08.240 --> 04:10.719
and she'll be okay.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.719
You bet she is.
She's gonna pull through.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.399
All right, let's
quit farting around.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.902
Back to work.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.319
Yeah, I certainly
do apologize, sir.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.399
No, no. Of course, we
appreciate your business.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.188
This is just what we
call simple human error.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.940
Thank you.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.822
Mr. Gillespie, a moment please.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.879
Check that out.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.319
Hey, man, what's goin' on in there?

04:58.320 --> 05:00.639
I heard another truck
come up short.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.679
I'd say it's about curtains
for Gillespie this time.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.279
I should say something.
I got to go do something.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.679
I tell you what you do.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.919
Call your ex.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.599
- Olivia?
- Call Olivia, man.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.279
Have her put in a
word with the hubby.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.279
Maybe save Gillespie a job.
Go on, do it.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.399
Man, it's been three years.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.479
I know.
You and her, you're special.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.879
Kevin's wife, man?
She can't save someone's job.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.439
That's the stupidest idea.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.988
All right.
Well, you asked.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.119
- Hey, sorry to interrupt guys.
- Not a good time.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.639
Mr. Gillespie, I just
need you to sign off...

05:30.640 --> 05:32.359
Mr. Gillespie is no longer with us.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.479
Put your paperwork on my desk.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.919
No, Kevin.
Is this necessary?

05:34.920 --> 05:37.559
At the office, it's Mr. Weese.
Go back to work.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.279
- You know...
- It's not a good time, Jake!

05:40.280 --> 05:42.748
Damn you, Kevin.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.839
Way to make the tough
call there, boss man.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.830
Excuse me, Anthony?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.239
Hard working old man like that.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.959
Hey, what the hell?
Let's get rid of 'em.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.239
Somebody got to take the fall.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.639
The buck got to stop somewhere.
Not with you.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.599
Is this funny to you?

06:05.600 --> 06:08.879
Well, it's not like
ha, ha funny, no.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.479
How about joining 'em?
Would that be funny?

06:11.480 --> 06:14.319
How about you try that?
I'll go right to corporate.

06:14.320 --> 06:20.279
Who I'm sure would love to hear about
your erratic behavior, frequent cat naps.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.559
You push a button on a large machine,
and you hardly do that well.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.439
So don't act like you're so special

06:25.440 --> 06:27.719
that anyone would miss
you if you were gone.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.199
They won't.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.351
So, back to work.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.919
There you go, man.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.399
Pretty much done.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.839
Come on.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.279
Need a ride?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.748
No, man. I'm good.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.119
All right. But I won't
be offering forever now.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.279
I'm all right, man.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.159
Walking helps me, you
know, clear my head.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.679
I don't know how you do
it walking all the time.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.199
All right, man.
See ya later, Catfish.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.079
Get a couple more shotgun
bumper stickers.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.991
Later, boy.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.799
Hey, who's sweet stang
is that outside?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.711
Do I look like a valet to you?

07:51.920 --> 07:54.079
- I saved you a seat.
- Hey, what's up boss?

07:54.080 --> 07:55.839
Two beers.
You still drinking beer?

07:55.840 --> 07:58.388
Hey, man, does a frog scratch
his ass before he farts?

07:59.400 --> 08:02.639
- Here's to the life, huh?
- Yeah. Carry on.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.679
Hey, grandpa.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.759
Hey, hey, hey.
Watch out you.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.399
Might have to take
you over my knee.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.599
That'll be interesting.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.279
Teach him some manners.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.319
Honey, I tried.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.839
You failed, but I
do crave discipline.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.719
Maybe you should take
me over your knee.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.790
Maybe.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.159
She likes me.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.359
Yeah, you think she
likes the old ones, huh?

08:24.360 --> 08:26.559
No. Not the older ones,
the classy ones.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.719
Hey, speaking of which, did
you see that GT out in the yard?

08:28.720 --> 08:31.159
Oh, hell yeah.
Did you see that GT out there?

08:31.160 --> 08:33.359
I'm sorry to break up the party.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.385
Gander yonder right there.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.279
Old man over there.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.319
Yeah, thanks for bringing
the bad news, Catfish.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.231
Always good to see ya.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.279
I didn't know he was
gonna be here tonight.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.239
Don't let it bring you down.
You didn't fire him.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.279
That son of a bitch Kevin did.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.199
That's gonna come back on him.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.639
You know what goes
around comes around.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.759
It's called karma, boy.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.719
It just seems like
there's guys out there

09:05.720 --> 09:07.319
that they can't even
fail if they try.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.479
Uh-oh. Hey, Judy, bring
two of these, will ya?

09:10.480 --> 09:11.519
Gonna need 'em.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.159
We box bolts and
straps for a living.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.399
That's what we do.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.559
We take bolts and straps,
and we put 'em in a box.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.679
Like, what kid wants to do
that when they grow up?

09:19.680 --> 09:23.239
You gonna do other things.
You're still young.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.559
Still young.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.119
You know what, what do I have
to look forward to, Cobb?

09:28.120 --> 09:30.439
I got my mom.
She's dying of cancer.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.159
Then my brother...
he's calling me all the time

09:32.160 --> 09:33.639
asking me to help him
pay these bills,

09:33.640 --> 09:35.159
and I can't afford a car to walk...

09:35.160 --> 09:37.759
I'm walking all around town
trying to get where I'm going.

09:37.760 --> 09:43.107
I got the scum bucket of a boss
married to my ex-girlfriend.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.639
It's like ever since I left
that girl, man, it's just like

09:47.640 --> 09:51.349
the first domino in this
long line of bad decisions.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.279
Things work out.
Like I say, you're still young.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.239
Are you listening to me?

09:58.240 --> 10:00.199
Yeah, I'm listening to you, man.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.828
Why don't you listen
to me for a minute.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.346
Hey, look at this.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.759
You know what that is?

10:10.760 --> 10:13.279
That's a court order.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.359
Let me tell you a story.

10:15.360 --> 10:21.119
The old man fall in love,
yeah with a younger girl.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.599
I thought she loved me too.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.679
We had a kid together.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.239
I mean, I'm thinking wedding bells,

10:27.240 --> 10:30.239
white picket fences, whew!

10:30.240 --> 10:32.919
I guess she wasn't
thinking that way because

10:32.920 --> 10:34.919
this is what love looks like, man.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.119
That's a court order.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.119
That says that I cannot come
within 500 yards of my own son.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.270
My own son!

10:43.520 --> 10:46.279
I mean, she can rot in hell,
but I would like to see my boy

10:46.280 --> 10:48.319
now and again.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.159
Yeah, you got problems, huh?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.399
I tell you something
about the courts.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.279
They gonna side with the woman
every time, don't matter if

10:53.280 --> 10:58.342
she's a woman of your dreams or a
frigid cold, vindictive bitch.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.704
Anyway, we all got problems, Jake.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.399
Hey man.
I'm sorry about that.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.119
I didn't know you had a kid.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.639
That's all right.
Don't matter.

11:10.640 --> 11:15.239
All I'm saying is we
all get dealt cards.

11:15.240 --> 11:19.239
It's how you play 'em and man,

11:19.240 --> 11:22.186
play yours better
than I played mine.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.705
Hey, thanks man.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.639
Hey, I'm a be right
back, all right?

11:32.640 --> 11:34.679
Yeah. I'm gonna go
get some air myself.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.959
Ow!

11:36.960 --> 11:39.827
Hit me like that.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.589
Hey, Gill.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.479
Look man, I'm sorry about the
way things went down today.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.559
It's not so bad, kid.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.279
Don't worry about it.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.639
Hell, he give me a
second chance at life.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.759
And after all, a man my age

12:20.760 --> 12:23.279
should have no problem
finding another job.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.799
Well, with the job market being
in such good shape and all...

12:26.800 --> 12:29.541
as am I.

12:30.240 --> 12:33.239
Plus with my generous
severance package,

12:33.240 --> 12:35.708
future's looking
pretty damn bright.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.439
I guess I should be
thanking you, Jake.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.119
That what you come over here for?

12:43.120 --> 12:45.748
So as I could thank ya?

12:46.360 --> 12:49.750
Yeah, I was just... sorry.

12:53.720 --> 12:59.101
Hey boy, brought you
something to ease the pain.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.279
I hope you noticed that

13:05.280 --> 13:07.703
I tried to stick up for
you back there today.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.359
Yeah, but Weese has had
a bean up his butt

13:10.360 --> 13:12.669
about me from the start.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.870
What is that?

13:30.280 --> 13:33.704
It's just some ugly old thing
my daddy give me as a boy.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.706
I should've got rid of
it a long time ago.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.519
- It's a monkey's paw.
- What?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.919
Monkey's paw.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.900
My dad said it'll do
magic if you want it to.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.542
Hey, monkey magic?

13:53.120 --> 13:54.439
Some kind of hoodoo?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.759
I never would've taken
you as an obeah, man.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.750
A little too pale.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.981
Tell you honestly, I'm
not sure what it is.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.439
But I tell you this, my daddy
said it could take hold of

14:09.440 --> 14:13.786
a man's life, move
the pieces around.

14:15.280 --> 14:20.439
Just gets passed on from
one person to the next

14:20.440 --> 14:23.519
bending a man's fate
to his own will,

14:23.520 --> 14:25.829
giving him whatever he wants.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.340
How?
How does it work?

14:31.200 --> 14:32.940
Three bones.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.861
Three good wishes that
only his owner can ask.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.239
You ever see 'em actually
work... the wishes?

14:44.240 --> 14:45.980
Of course.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.621
I wished for eternal good looks.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.191
Go ahead.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.990
Give it a shot.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.990
All right.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.904
Won't be too hard.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.862
I wish for that
bitching GT outside.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.319
All right.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.221
Felt good.
You guys feel that?

15:26.240 --> 15:27.319
It's my turn.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.026
No.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.305
It's his now.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.702
Won't work for no one else until
he finishes his three bones.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.679
I can't.
It's yours.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.239
It's, you know, from
your dad and all.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.239
No.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.239
It's yours now.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.708
Just an old trinket anyhow.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.220
Doing me a favor getting
that thing out of my sight.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.142
Consider it a peace treaty.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.591
No hard feelings.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.304
No hard feelings, boy.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.306
Hey!
Still here.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.707
Man, she is pretty.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.270
Whose is that?

16:40.280 --> 16:42.159
Look at that.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.799
Whoa.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.559
Come on, man. Let's go.
I'm getting tired.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.239
How about that?

16:48.240 --> 16:50.519
Damn!
Damn, Jake!

16:50.520 --> 16:52.704
Keys are in it.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.709
Look for yourself!

16:56.240 --> 16:58.519
Whoa, how about that?
That thing works!

16:58.520 --> 17:00.759
Come on, man.
You know that's a coincidence.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.910
Maybe.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.944
Man, come on, baby!

17:29.120 --> 17:30.919
Car's not in the driveway.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.070
I don't think she's home.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.279
Exactly what was the plan here?

17:35.280 --> 17:38.479
What do you figure you gonna
drive up and sweep her off her

17:38.480 --> 17:42.871
feet, drive off into the
sunset just the three of us?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.279
You ready to go?
I'm ready to go.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.919
No, no.
Hold on.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.263
Just so it shouldn't
be a total loss.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.199
Cobb, what are you doing?

17:54.200 --> 17:55.839
Just stay in the car, Jake.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.759
Don't get your panties in a twist.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.519
- Get back in the car!
- That's all right.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.439
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna leave a message

18:01.440 --> 18:02.839
on the little car right now.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.559
This is our boss' house!
Seriously, stop!

18:04.560 --> 18:07.679
Don't do that.
Don't ever do that.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.591
Come on, man.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.119
Look, we got to go, all right?

18:13.120 --> 18:15.599
All right, but don't forget.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.944
You mess with the Cobb,
you get the corn.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.319
Huh?

18:21.320 --> 18:23.788
Nasty drunk, you know that?

18:24.760 --> 18:26.830
Uh-oh.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.239
What's going on, Jake?

18:39.240 --> 18:40.679
Hey, Olivia.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.399
Kevin's not home.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.159
A little late for stopping
by don't ya think?

18:44.160 --> 18:46.519
Is it?

18:46.520 --> 18:49.239
Sorry.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.919
I don't have my phone on me.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.639
- You drunk?
- No. You know Tony?

18:53.640 --> 18:55.319
He works at the factory.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.439
Hi Tony.
Who's car?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.079
That's mine.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.839
- You have a car now?
- Yeah.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.279
I wished for it.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.799
Okay.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.359
Hey, Olivia...

19:07.360 --> 19:09.159
What part of this
don't you understand?

19:09.160 --> 19:10.879
Where is Kevin at
this time of night?

19:10.880 --> 19:12.119
Shouldn't he be home?

19:12.120 --> 19:14.279
He's prepping for the
fundraiser at St. Luke's.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.239
But I just drove by there,
and they're all closed up,

19:16.240 --> 19:18.799
so I will be expecting
him back shortly.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.839
Why are you looking for him?

19:20.840 --> 19:23.229
I'm...

19:25.080 --> 19:27.239
here for you.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.879
Yeah, that's one thing
you've never been.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.279
That's really mean
and really not nice.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.260
I'm married, Jake.
Too little, too late.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.980
Says who?

19:40.720 --> 19:42.745
Me.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.759
Go on. Go home

19:49.760 --> 19:52.627
before Kevin gets home
and fires your ass.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.519
Night, Tony.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.704
Hey.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.708
Gosh, she's really pretty.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.599
She's kind of a fetching
girl, ain't she?

20:14.600 --> 20:16.719
See the way she look at you?
I think you got a shot.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.239
You think you got a shot with her?

20:18.240 --> 20:22.719
What are you doing with that knife, Cobb?
Just gonna twist his titties, that's all.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.759
Just gonna break his
chops a little.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.359
Yeah, it didn't seem like you
were breaking chops, man.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.519
What did it look like?

20:29.520 --> 20:30.839
I don't know.
Looks like you were

20:30.840 --> 20:32.639
losing your mind a
little bit, that's what.

20:32.640 --> 20:36.747
Hey man, I'm not the one making
wishes on a monkey's paw, am I?

20:38.240 --> 20:40.230
- Maybe I am...
- I'm sorry about that.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.391
Watch it!

21:23.880 --> 21:25.745
Cobb.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.824
Hey.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.702
- Dude, help me.
- What's that?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.946
Hey, buddy.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.266
Cobb?

22:22.920 --> 22:25.070
I'm gonna call for help.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.909
Hey, man.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.750
I wish you weren't dead.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.711
Help!

23:51.240 --> 23:53.310
Oh my lord.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.239
911 operator. What's
your emergency?

24:01.240 --> 24:02.279
Hell on earth, sister.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.079
I need an ambulance fast
as you can, all right?

24:04.080 --> 24:05.599
Where you located?

24:05.600 --> 24:08.279
I'm a ways out on
I-10 near Mettery.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.239
Stay calm. Go ahead and
tell me what happened.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.708
I didn't see a damn thing.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.839
I don't know.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.159
I just... I was driving along
on the road and then I just

24:17.160 --> 24:20.239
stopped, and I saw him
and I think this fella's dead.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.981
I don't know.
You need to come now!

24:24.280 --> 24:27.079
Yes!

24:27.080 --> 24:29.662
I told you!
I don't know what's going on.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.784
Am I still dead?

25:52.840 --> 25:55.263
Take hold of a man's life,

25:56.400 --> 25:58.709
bending a man's fate,

26:00.560 --> 26:03.188
giving him whatever he wants.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.879
I got three brothers.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.559
As we speak, one's locked up.
One's an MP.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.559
One's a minor league
hockey forward.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.519
My ex, we used to call him Bailey,

26:29.520 --> 26:32.199
so you see I've had my fair
share of patching up noggins

26:32.200 --> 26:34.239
over the years.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.547
Still say you ought to go to the
hospital, but no one listens to me.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.984
I don't feel nothing.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.390
Tough stuff, huh?

26:53.640 --> 26:55.710
Press it.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.439
Poor thing.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.705
Been through a trauma.
Your beard is all white.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.791
I always did have a thing
for the old fellers.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.904
Who's Abby?

27:51.240 --> 27:53.185
Real nice.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.351
Hey, Jamie.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.709
Because I brought someone home.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.262
It's not that interesting.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.799
Okay, and I'm freaking
bored, all right?

28:22.800 --> 28:26.270
Turns out, there wasn't much
to work with it anyway.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.345
I'll call you back.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.119
I think you should go home,

28:44.120 --> 28:46.702
send you on back to
that Abby of yours.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.639
Hey! Where you going with that?

28:52.640 --> 28:54.744
That's my hoodie.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.119
- Hey!
- Good morning, detective.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.519
Good morning to you.
How you doing today?

30:12.520 --> 30:15.068
- Very good, sir.
- Good.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.548
Can I help you with something, sir?

30:55.240 --> 30:57.151
Hey, son.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.359
Let's you and me go fishing.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.199
You've got about two minutes!

31:02.200 --> 31:03.679
Response time around
here is pretty good!

31:03.680 --> 31:06.228
You are not invited!

31:07.080 --> 31:09.119
What'd you do to your face?

31:09.120 --> 31:11.199
You know, actually I don't care!

31:11.200 --> 31:13.879
Yes, hello? I need police, please.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.879
- Look at you.
- Restraining order violation.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.159
Growing up! Getting big!

31:18.160 --> 31:21.584
You stay away from him!
You get off of my property now!

31:27.320 --> 31:30.039
Take this.
Go and get in the car.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.839
Huh?
No, ma'am.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.239
He's not my husband.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.719
Yes, he's driving away.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.063
I'll stay on the phone with you.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.799
Look, I'm just trying to
find my friend, all right?

31:52.800 --> 31:54.904
C-O-B-B.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.199
He's not in the ER.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.559
Jake, boy.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.199
You see Cobb?

32:00.200 --> 32:01.719
I ain't seen him.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.199
All right. Thank you.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.039
I checked outside, where he
usually likes to kick a couple,

32:06.040 --> 32:07.951
but I don't know.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.319
Look, what do I look
like his mother, Catfish?

32:10.320 --> 32:12.279
I'm sure he's fine.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.861
All right.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.311
Is it a crime that I asked?

32:17.160 --> 32:19.199
You said that you
were working late.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.879
This is not a suitable
time or the place.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.679
No. I want to know.
Where were you?

32:23.680 --> 32:24.719
I told you.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.700
You're running around town...

32:31.520 --> 32:33.670
Olivia!

32:37.200 --> 32:39.225
Not now, Jake.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.670
Is there something I can do?

32:44.160 --> 32:48.279
Yeah, give me a do over.
This whole thing all of it.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.589
Could you do that?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.669
That's what I thought.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.785
- Need a lift?
- No, I'm good.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.159
That's it, right there.
Last straw, boy.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.319
No more.

33:03.320 --> 33:07.239
If a boy don't want to do nothing
the hard way, the hard way you do?

33:07.240 --> 33:09.708
See you, Catfish.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.230
Enjoy your weekend.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.820
Jake.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.110
Surprise.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.719
I thought you were dead.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.984
I believe I was.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.704
That's impossible.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.748
It's the paw, Jake.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.359
Three wishes.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.599
First the car, then me.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.799
You wished this on me, didn't ya?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.599
Didn't ya?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.438
- No.
- Yeah, you did.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.559
Cobb, no.
I didn't.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.039
I want that third wish.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.719
Gillespie said there's no wish.

34:37.719 --> 34:40.438
It's the paw.
It's trash.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.543
It's a trinket.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.661
It's Olivia, isn't it?

34:45.199 --> 34:47.079
What are you talking about?

34:47.080 --> 34:52.679
Jake, you don't got to waste
that third wish on her.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.228
You gonna get her
back without wishing.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.151
I promise you.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.708
I'll see you later...

35:08.240 --> 35:10.549
alligator.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.799
I hope you don't mind
the change of setting.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.679
I don't mind, baby.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.830
It's cozy.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.625
Hello!

36:55.200 --> 36:56.986
Cobb?

36:59.480 --> 37:01.584
What the hell are you doing here?

37:03.080 --> 37:04.945
Overtime?

37:19.600 --> 37:23.024
No, no, no, no, no.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.399
Cobb!

37:25.400 --> 37:27.879
Cobb, untie me right now!

37:27.880 --> 37:29.905
Cobb, get me out of here!

37:30.760 --> 37:32.199
Cobb!

37:32.200 --> 37:34.679
I pushed the button
on a large machine,

37:34.680 --> 37:37.839
and I hardly do that too
good, but you know what?

37:37.840 --> 37:39.679
I do it just good enough.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.039
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.159
Listen to me!
Cobb!

37:42.160 --> 37:44.759
Oh, stop acting like
you so special!

37:44.760 --> 37:46.479
Ain't nobody gonna miss
you when you're gone!

37:46.480 --> 37:48.239
No, no, wait, wait.
Listen to me.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.151
Cobb, just listen to me, please.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.111
Hey, Charlie.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.509
Yeah, I know man.
I'm on my way.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.199
Are you sure you're
all right there, Jake?

39:12.200 --> 39:13.239
No, I'm fine.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.439
You know, just some late
nights... a couple of...

39:15.440 --> 39:17.199
a little bit of trouble at work.
That's all.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.319
- There you go, baby.
- Thanks, Sandy.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.159
It's not a layoff is it?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.599
We can still carry
most of mom's bill,

39:21.600 --> 39:24.479
but I'll still need some
help like we talked about.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.824
Yeah. We're good.
It's not layoffs.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.279
How's mom doing by the way?

39:31.280 --> 39:33.239
You'd know if you
went and visited her.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.159
Come on, Charlie.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.399
Betty's doing fine, Jake.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.719
I'm going to visit her.
All right?

39:38.720 --> 39:40.665
When?

39:42.720 --> 39:44.870
Yeah, you better get that.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.199
Honey.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.145
Babe.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.519
- Hey.
- Hey, Jake.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.359
Sorry to bother you.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.799
I didn't know who else to call.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.519
Are you all right?

39:58.520 --> 40:01.830
Kevin didn't come home last night.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.199
You didn't have to come
all the way down here.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.190
You sounded pretty shaken up.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.519
He has stayed out before,
but not this long.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.022
Well, I'm sure he's
just cooling off.

40:16.720 --> 40:20.861
To tell you the truth, it's the
cooling off that's the problem.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.186
Me and him...

40:24.880 --> 40:26.711
You and him what?

40:29.200 --> 40:31.304
I don't even know anymore.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.239
I need to get back to this.

40:35.240 --> 40:38.823
Hey, let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

40:41.720 --> 40:43.799
I know it's hard for
you to believe,

40:43.800 --> 40:47.199
but he was really good to me
when we first started out.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.190
He listened.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.839
Sorry.
What were you saying?

40:51.840 --> 40:54.039
Of course, he listened.
He was your AA sponsor.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.239
He used to be present.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.759
He wasn't afraid of the future,
and I needed that after you.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.159
I wasn't afraid of the future.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.199
No. You just never
even thought about it.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.304
It's worse.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.719
I got an idea.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.949
Come on.
Come with me.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.670
It's gonna be fun.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.399
Afraid of the future, huh?

41:22.400 --> 41:26.199
I knew you'd sit with me as
soon as I saw you walking there.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.225
I'm sure you did.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.661
Palms or cards?
What's your pleasure?

41:33.400 --> 41:35.584
Cards.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.545
I beg your pardon?

41:59.080 --> 42:01.639
You have willingly entered
into the combination

42:01.640 --> 42:03.719
of that what is dark.

42:03.720 --> 42:07.702
Now you sit responsible
for the man with no soul.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.879
He's upon your life.

42:10.880 --> 42:14.668
You make him so he makes you.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.188
You got your wish...

42:32.440 --> 42:34.510
Olivia.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.510
What did you do?

42:39.120 --> 42:40.839
Now it's my turn.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.229
There is no wish.

42:45.640 --> 42:49.119
The car was already there,
Cobb, and you're not dead.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.190
I want it, Jake.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.504
I don't have it.

42:56.320 --> 43:00.791
I mean, I went looking
for it, and I can't find it.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.783
I'm sorry.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.826
I can't help you.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.839
My mom's cancer...
I'm helping my brother...

43:13.840 --> 43:16.547
my brother is asking me
to help her pay her bills.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.279
I don't know what broke inside you,

43:20.280 --> 43:22.748
but something's broken, man.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.864
I get it.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.902
Man, I don't owe you a damn thing.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.509
Yeah, you do.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.199
How are we doing, Ms. Betty?

43:44.200 --> 43:47.180
Better than Custer,
worst than I'd like.

43:48.200 --> 43:52.159
My youngest supposed to visit
today, but we'll just see.

43:52.160 --> 43:54.519
That sounds nice.

43:54.520 --> 43:57.261
We'll be back to check
on you in a little bit.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.544
Jake?

44:14.280 --> 44:16.669
I'm a friend of your son.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.547
He asked me to come by.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.799
I'm sorry.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.479
What for, doll?

44:26.480 --> 44:29.506
I'm gonna put my hands
over your face now.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.670
It's all right.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.359
I been there.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.624
Not so bad.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.999
Jake?

44:45.000 --> 44:46.839
Sandy, hey, where is she?

44:46.840 --> 44:48.399
What happened?

44:48.400 --> 44:51.665
It was something with her heart.
They're not quite sure.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.079
Where's Charlie?

44:55.080 --> 44:58.199
He's on his way back
from Baton Rouge.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.559
I'm so sorry.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.799
Can I see her?

45:01.800 --> 45:03.199
They're not letting anybody in.

45:03.200 --> 45:06.101
Where is she?
What'd they do with her?

45:07.240 --> 45:09.119
- What'd they do with her?
- Jake!

45:09.120 --> 45:12.100
Don't go crazy.
It was just her time!

46:09.360 --> 46:11.319
Yeah.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.584
Condolences.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.199
What did you do?

46:20.200 --> 46:22.559
Come see me.
We'll talk.

46:22.560 --> 46:25.188
Where?

46:38.080 --> 46:40.025
Cobb!

46:42.160 --> 46:44.150
Cobb!

47:03.520 --> 47:05.670
Was it you?

47:06.200 --> 47:08.668
I did it for you, Jake.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.270
That'll do.

47:25.160 --> 47:29.119
You are one selfish
son of a bitch, Jake!

47:29.120 --> 47:30.999
You got what you want.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.519
Got your girl back.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.039
Your mom is in peace.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.359
It's my turn now!

47:35.360 --> 47:37.359
- What do you want?
- I want my boy.

47:37.360 --> 47:38.559
I want him to love me!

47:38.560 --> 47:41.039
I want you to wish my
son back into my life!

47:41.040 --> 47:42.905
I don't have it.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.743
You better find it!

48:05.160 --> 48:06.759
No.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.625
Then what are you on?

48:11.160 --> 48:13.159
I'm not on anything.

48:13.160 --> 48:14.839
Okay.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.359
So some old grump gives
you this... what was it?

48:18.360 --> 48:20.519
- A paw,
- A paw?

48:20.520 --> 48:22.670
Which is where now?

48:24.040 --> 48:26.159
I threw it away.

48:26.160 --> 48:27.399
A paw?

48:27.400 --> 48:29.159
Says you get three wishes.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.759
You wished for a car,
which you then steal?

48:31.760 --> 48:34.239
- It's hard to explain.
- I'm doing all right, I think!

48:34.240 --> 48:36.239
You steal it.
You wreck it.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.399
Your buddy from work is chunked
in the brains, but you wish him

48:38.400 --> 48:41.079
back to life, maybe, and now
he's threatening people you know

48:41.080 --> 48:42.719
if you don't give
him your last wish!

48:42.720 --> 48:45.239
And also you're not on drugs.
Did I leave anything out?

48:45.240 --> 48:47.039
Yeah.
Sarcasm, Charlie.

48:47.040 --> 48:49.719
Hell, yes, sarcasm!
I just lost my mother.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.399
It sounds crazy.

48:51.400 --> 48:54.199
Yeah.
Yeah, it does, Jake.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.479
Guys, you need to call the police.

48:56.480 --> 48:59.479
I know.

48:59.480 --> 49:02.319
I think you guys need
to get out of town

49:02.320 --> 49:05.199
until all this blows
over just for a bit.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.199
JJ, what have you done?

49:07.200 --> 49:13.119
Hey, we could take a few
days off up at the cabin.

49:13.120 --> 49:17.545
Might be good for you, for
us after your mom and all.

49:18.600 --> 49:20.439
Okay?

49:20.440 --> 49:22.146
Okay.

49:22.680 --> 49:24.705
Whatever you say.

49:35.800 --> 49:38.799
Mr. Tilton?
Detective Margolis.

49:38.800 --> 49:43.839
So, this man you say is
making threats against you.

49:43.840 --> 49:46.159
When did you see him last?

49:46.160 --> 49:48.199
This morning.

49:48.200 --> 49:50.239
He assaulted me.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.159
Got some bruises I see.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.839
He also murdered my mother.

49:53.840 --> 49:57.039
Yeah, about that, I spoke with
the attending over at Charity,

49:57.040 --> 50:01.319
and they're saying heart failure.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.825
When was the last time
you saw Kevin Weese?

50:09.160 --> 50:10.479
What does this have
to do with anything?

50:10.480 --> 50:12.559
You know he's dead?

50:12.560 --> 50:16.119
Somebody crushed him in one
of your industrial presses

50:16.120 --> 50:19.199
over at the supply
warehouse where you and he

50:19.200 --> 50:22.599
and this Mr. Cobb all work.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.023
Tony Cobb.

50:27.400 --> 50:30.519
He did this, man.
You got to believe me.

50:30.520 --> 50:35.025
How long have you been seeing
the late Mr. Weese's wife?

50:36.520 --> 50:38.039
Where are you getting
your information?

50:38.040 --> 50:39.999
- An anonymous tip.
- Tony Cobb.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.359
You haven't denied it yet.

50:41.360 --> 50:45.501
Tony Cobb is behind all this.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.079
I remember you.

50:53.080 --> 50:55.079
You were here the other morning.

50:55.080 --> 50:57.867
You looked like you needed
someone to talk to.

50:59.320 --> 51:01.663
What's on your mind?

51:03.640 --> 51:05.710
Am I under arrest?

51:06.240 --> 51:08.159
No.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.039
No, not yet.

51:10.040 --> 51:14.545
But if you leave town, that
could be a big problem.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.279
You knew, didn't you?

52:22.280 --> 52:23.479
What this thing did.

52:23.480 --> 52:26.239
I knew it was bad luck.

52:26.240 --> 52:29.141
I figured you deserved some.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.839
Did you ever use it?

52:33.840 --> 52:36.069
I never had the guts.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.549
My daddy did, though.

52:43.240 --> 52:47.079
We used to own 30 acres of land
just past the point there.

52:47.080 --> 52:51.279
My dad and mom, my brother and me.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.639
My brother hated it here
so he joined the Corp

52:54.640 --> 52:57.159
as soon as he hit 18.

52:57.160 --> 53:02.159
Mom wasn't happy about it, but
she loved him something fierce.

53:02.160 --> 53:06.239
My daddy was so pissed off

53:06.240 --> 53:08.519
so he rented out my brother's room

53:08.520 --> 53:11.261
to make sure he never come home.

53:12.120 --> 53:17.581
One night, a wanderer, weird
fella, he passes through port

53:18.720 --> 53:24.199
and needs a place to stay and he
can't pay so he shows my daddy

53:24.200 --> 53:28.466
a collection of trinkets
to barter with,

53:29.640 --> 53:32.359
and among 'em was this
one little monkey's paw.

53:32.360 --> 53:36.119
He tells him wish
on it three times,

53:36.120 --> 53:38.559
give a man whatever he desires.

53:38.560 --> 53:43.119
As a joke, my daddy wishes it
to help pay off his mortgage.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.439
Didn't think nothing of it.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.759
Traveler spends the night,

53:46.760 --> 53:50.679
is gone before sun come
up the next morning.

53:50.680 --> 53:54.399
Days later, we got word
my brother died in combat.

53:54.400 --> 53:57.710
But then we get his
life insurance policy,

53:59.640 --> 54:03.667
the exact price of the
mortgage to the penny.

54:07.240 --> 54:10.141
My family was never
the same after that.

54:12.120 --> 54:15.988
What happened with the
other two wishes?

54:16.840 --> 54:19.079
Let's just say my mom
would've done anything to see

54:19.080 --> 54:21.503
my brother's face again.

54:26.520 --> 54:29.068
Don't play with fate, boy.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.239
It did something to Cobb.

54:34.240 --> 54:36.119
I don't know what.

54:36.120 --> 54:39.624
He's different.

54:41.160 --> 54:42.439
Psychotic.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.544
Soulless?

54:47.160 --> 54:48.399
Yeah.

54:48.400 --> 54:52.319
I should've got rid of
that damn thing years ago.

54:52.320 --> 54:58.270
Look, if I have this monkey's
paw and it works, right?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.199
Well, then I can just
wish all this undone.

55:01.200 --> 55:05.119
It'll give you what you ask for
but not the way you want it.

55:05.120 --> 55:09.719
It takes from what's there
and spits it back darker.

55:09.720 --> 55:11.599
Poison.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.671
Don't bring anymore
misery upon yourself.

55:19.440 --> 55:22.625
Don't look like it gone well
judging by the look back there.

55:24.040 --> 55:26.030
Let's get out of here.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.900
Feel better?

55:34.240 --> 55:36.199
Mississippi?

55:36.200 --> 55:38.799
Jackson, which was named
after Andrew Jackson.

55:38.800 --> 55:41.199
Right. Nevada?

55:41.200 --> 55:43.304
Carson City.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.822
Hold on, baby.
Stay right here.

55:54.480 --> 55:56.664
Are you Abby?

55:58.200 --> 56:02.399
He came by here...
his face seemed different.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.504
I don't know.

56:06.120 --> 56:07.985
What happened to him?

56:09.040 --> 56:11.463
I don't know.

56:13.080 --> 56:15.150
Something bad.

56:17.560 --> 56:20.999
Whatever it is, I feel responsible.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.719
No. No.

56:23.720 --> 56:26.519
You didn't make him what he is.

56:26.520 --> 56:29.519
You see, Tony was always a bad egg.

56:29.520 --> 56:32.719
I guess that's how I got in trouble
with him in the first place.

56:32.720 --> 56:35.666
I liked bad eggs.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.750
Now, I'm paying for it.

56:46.560 --> 56:49.199
So what are you gonna do now?

56:49.200 --> 56:51.159
I don't know.

56:51.160 --> 56:53.628
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

57:59.160 --> 58:01.708
I should've listened.

59:17.520 --> 59:19.590
No.

59:22.360 --> 59:24.146
No.

59:26.720 --> 59:28.790
No!

59:31.480 --> 59:33.470
No!

59:40.280 --> 59:42.119
Margolis.

59:42.120 --> 59:44.239
The witness described
an older dude.

59:44.240 --> 59:48.639
Big son of a bitch, about 6'2,
drives an old model 4 by 4.

59:48.640 --> 59:50.439
Sounds familiar.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.559
Think it might be that
Tony Cobb character, sir?

59:52.560 --> 59:55.079
The warehouse is the connection.

59:55.080 --> 59:59.679
I don't see Jake Tilton as this
mad ripper type, and the Weese

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.719
widow, she doesn't have
the physical strength.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.159
So Cobb, he's our best bet.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.279
Look, I'm gonna go track her down.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.719
See if you can land eyes on Tilton.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.460
Right. I'm on it.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.199
You okay?

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.828
Yeah, sure.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.544
Good 'cause I'm not.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.105
Let's go.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.159
Now the so-called police call
this a throw down piece.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.947
Got a file number, got no paper.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.744
You can have it if you need it,
just keep my name all the way out.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.319
It's for self-defense
if that matters.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.359
Sure.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.159
I need to borrow your truck.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.469
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.159
Been some bad, creepy blow
around here the last few day.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.028
Boss Kevin, poor Gillie.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.105
Gillespie?

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.199
Ya didn't hear?

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.159
Early tonight out by
the trailer of his.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.981
Somebody done burn up
his car real good.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.108
Worse for your health than smoking.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.519
Yeah.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.624
Thanks, Catfish.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.225
I owe you one.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.269
Jake, boy, so much for
lover, not a fighter, huh?

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.028
My brother may be a screw up,
but my woman is an absolute rock.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.824
Just get the gas.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.464
Look at this jerk.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.150
I've seen that truck.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.265
This can't be happening.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.439
Charlie, hey. What's up?

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.159
- What does he drive?
- What?

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.119
Cobb. His car, what is it?

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.559
He drives an old car.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.199
He got behind on his payments, and he
doesn't even have it anymore. Why?

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.199
Okay.
It's not him.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.359
Never mind.
We're on our way to the cabin.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.639
We thought it was him.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.666
It's just some jackass
tailgating in a busted 4 by 4.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.319
Oh!

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.265
Charlie!

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.544
Oh God!

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.719
There's a man following us.
He intends to harm us.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.824
We need the authorities out here!

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.159
Well, I reckon I'm the
authorities around here, fella.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.230
The real police!

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.708
Aggravation I do not need!

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.904
Hey!

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.545
Are you insane?

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.025
I'm gonna get fired!

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.279
You got to be out
of your damn mind!

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.319
Drunk driver, you almost... oh.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.279
Almost?

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.226
I'm just gonna...

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.950
I'm just gonna go, all right?

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.180
Sandy.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.946
Sandy!

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:54.118
- Charlie, what are you doing?
- This ends now.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.118
Charlie!

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.519
- Run!
- No!

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.559
Sandy!

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.220
Jake!

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.439
Jake, I don't know what he's doing.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:05.068
Stay back you son of a bitch!

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.024
Oh my God!

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.158
No! Please! No!

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.469
No!

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.559
Help.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.399
I'll see you at Abby's house.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.584
Be there.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.709
Where are you?

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.704
I thought you might be here.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.159
I want my lawyer.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.823
I'm not taking you in,
not like that anyway.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.159
So what then?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.119
Have you spoken to Mr. Tilton?

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.559
No, but he didn't do it.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.119
You weren't so sure the other day.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.039
I am now.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.871
It wasn't him.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.589
Well, I believe you.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.591
Do you know someone
named Anthony Cobb?

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.039
Oh, God.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.519
Look, I want to take you to a
safe location, somewhere we can

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.199
keep our eyes on you, protect you.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.719
- What about Jake?
- Him, too.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.621
It's going to be all right.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.119
Why is all this happening?

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.559
It's hard to say, but the awful
truth is bad things happen

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.791
all the time,
especially around here.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.679
I just want to...

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.639
I just want to make sure
nothing happens to you

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.790
if you come with me, all right?

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.999
Okay.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.599
Let me get my stuff.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.625
All right.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.141
No!

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.587
Hey!

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.270
Yeah, I'm talking to you!

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.439
What the hell is that?

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.599
You just put that lady
in the trash can, man.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.831
I don't care where you're from.
That's bad manners.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.039
So, here's what's gonna happen.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.439
Once you let her out of that
trash can what you are gonna do,

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.119
my friend, I'm gonna teach
you a thing or two about

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.941
proper etiquette with the ladies.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.119
Let's rock.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.906
Let's roll.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.590
Oh no!

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.665
No!

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.549
Is somebody there?

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:33.039
Hey, are you all right?

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.559
- Yeah.
- Where's Cobb?

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.079
He's inside.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.799
I heard him and screaming.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.159
He killed a cop, Jake.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.039
Yeah, something bad
happened to him.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.271
I don't really know
how to explain it.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.509
What is that?

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.270
It's what started it.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.549
Now, I'm gonna end it.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.585
Abby.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.142
You asked me to be
here, and here I am.

01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.588
Please don't do anything.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.590
Listen, just let her go.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.159
Let her go.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.903
My son!

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.670
Okay.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.704
Is this what you want?

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.230
I brought it.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.064
You want your wish,

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.590
but Tony, it ruins things, man.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.119
It takes what you want,

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.590
and it ruins it just
like it ruined you.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.439
You were right at the bar the
other night when you told me

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.239
that I didn't appreciate anything.

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.359
I was taking it all for granted.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.943
My job. My family.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.185
My friend.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.599
Look around.
This is all my fault.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.159
This isn't on anyone else.
This is on me, man.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.061
My Son!

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.590
Okay.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.705
No.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.110
I wish my friend,

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.509
Tony Cobb...

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.548
had his soul back.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.745
No!

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.068
Go inside!
Fast!

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.748
Tony, let me in!

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.559
Tony!

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.585
Open the door!

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.744
Open this door right now!

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.949
No!

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.589
Please don't!

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.519
Tony, don't. No.
This isn't you.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.704
This is not you.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.586
Abby.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.863
I just want to take my boy fishing.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.582
I am so...

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.190
so sorry.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.987
Come on.
Stay with me, Jake.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:53.185
Jake.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.519
Where am I?

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.079
Everything's gonna
be all right, sir.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.719
Take over a man's life.

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.585
The paw.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.550
Where's the paw?

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.585
Where's the paw?

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.719
The paw.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.279
Sir, it's a part of your life.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.719
No. You're not listening.
Where's the paw?

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.159
Sir, calm down.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.946
No, no.

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.901
No!

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.586
Where's the paw?

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.399
You buckled up?

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.504
Yep.
