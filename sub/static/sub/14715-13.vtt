WEBVTT

00:00.233 --> 00:01.913
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:01.933 --> 00:04.532
I'm coming get you in the Mustang
and cool stuff. I'll be fun.

00:04.546 --> 00:05.947
- Ok.
- I'll see you in two weeks.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.980
- Are you getting.
- No.

00:07.981 --> 00:11.892
What is that even mean?

00:11.919 --> 00:14.788
I hate you! I hate...

00:14.790 --> 00:16.122
Help!

00:16.123 --> 00:18.191
- Hey, what's going on?
- What happened?

00:18.193 --> 00:19.559
<i>Something's wrong with the twins.</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:21.394
What?

00:22.497 --> 00:23.930
Things are falling through the cracks

00:23.932 --> 00:26.132
every day that Mac is in jail.

00:26.134 --> 00:28.068
- You know they are.
- I'll talk to Connie again.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.203
And here's what
you're going to tell her.

00:30.205 --> 00:31.571
I'm going to preach.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.441
Not you, not Grace. Me.

00:34.443 --> 00:36.343
- Mae...
- Just for a while.

00:36.345 --> 00:37.878
When did this happen?

00:37.880 --> 00:41.181
I got the notice of seizure from
the city a couple months ago.

00:41.183 --> 00:44.684
<i>Whoever Mac has in his pocket
at city hall ain't budging.</i>

00:44.686 --> 00:46.143
Is there any way out?

00:46.168 --> 00:47.787
Bishop: <i>There's always
a way out, you know that.</i>

00:47.789 --> 00:50.290
You just have to confess.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:30.331 --> 01:32.232
Carlton: <i>So, what was the problem?</i>

01:32.234 --> 01:33.833
They don't know.

01:33.835 --> 01:36.736
The doctor said it was
probably triggered by stress.

01:36.738 --> 01:38.438
But the babies are okay?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.574
Yeah, they're back to normal.

01:40.576 --> 01:42.876
I guess I was just stressed.

02:04.432 --> 02:05.632
Thanks for coming.

02:05.634 --> 02:07.067
What in the hell do you want, Robert?

02:07.636 --> 02:08.602
You're not even going to ask

02:08.604 --> 02:09.869
how my shoulder's doing?

02:09.871 --> 02:10.714
No.

02:11.773 --> 02:14.007
Got a sentencing hearing coming up.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.461
Mm-hmm.

02:16.463 --> 02:19.312
If you appeared as a character witness,

02:19.314 --> 02:23.316
you know, said I'd
had a change of heart...

02:23.888 --> 02:25.151
Are you kidding me?

02:26.121 --> 02:27.620
I'm just looking for a reason

02:27.623 --> 02:29.789
not to tell the law what you did.

02:30.504 --> 02:32.992
With me locked up in here
and my assets frozen,

02:32.995 --> 02:35.061
that old man of mine is not
going to keep quiet for long.

02:35.063 --> 02:36.577
You're in trouble.

02:37.666 --> 02:39.099
I don't know how
you look at the world...

02:39.101 --> 02:41.109
Same way you do, I imagine.

02:41.111 --> 02:42.458
No.

02:43.338 --> 02:44.738
I look at the world and I see nothing

02:44.740 --> 02:46.439
but the glory of the Lord.

02:46.721 --> 02:47.940
Seems like all you see

02:47.943 --> 02:50.944
are ants climbing
all over some dead thing

02:51.337 --> 02:53.046
trying to get another taste of the meat.

02:55.716 --> 02:56.883
Well, you do what you want.

03:00.154 --> 03:01.655
There's no way I'm going to spit

03:01.657 --> 03:03.890
on the memory of my
daughter shining you up.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.794
You go to hell.

03:18.906 --> 03:20.774
<i>♪ Amen</i>

03:24.345 --> 03:25.879
<i>♪ Amen</i>

03:34.221 --> 03:35.689
<i>♪ Well</i>

03:48.135 --> 03:51.971
<i>♪ Amen, amen, ooh.</i>

04:05.957 --> 04:07.506
All I want to know is if I hope

04:07.531 --> 04:08.830
to negotiate a new custody agreement,

04:08.832 --> 04:10.858
would my moving back
to Phoenix this summer,

04:10.883 --> 04:12.883
would that hurt or help my chances

04:12.908 --> 04:14.308
of bringing her back here to live?

04:14.310 --> 04:15.075
Sorry to bother you.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.213
Hold on a sec, Mike. What's up?

04:16.587 --> 04:18.153
Your grandfather's
in the conference room.

04:20.865 --> 04:21.856
Mike, I have to call you back.

04:21.858 --> 04:23.912
Does my mother know he's here?

04:23.945 --> 04:25.131
No, she's at the Templeton.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.579
I wouldn't have let him in otherwise.

04:33.410 --> 04:35.211
Now, you know Mama said
she'd call the cops

04:35.213 --> 04:36.537
if you came around again.

04:37.450 --> 04:38.515
What are you doing here?

04:39.969 --> 04:41.959
You put my boy in jail,

04:42.721 --> 04:45.705
so you've got to take care
of my ass now.

04:50.495 --> 04:52.170
Here's the thing, Pastor.

04:52.498 --> 04:53.630
It's not going to be a church.

04:54.212 --> 04:56.305
So, what's it going to be, then?

04:57.059 --> 04:59.176
A Christian community center,

04:59.805 --> 05:02.748
but like no Christian community
center you've ever seen.

05:03.342 --> 05:04.808
Where's it going to be, exactly?

05:04.810 --> 05:06.634
Don't worry. We're almost there.

05:11.416 --> 05:12.738
Here we are.

05:14.208 --> 05:15.531
Jacob: <i>Well, that's Calvary.</i>

05:15.988 --> 05:17.721
What? No, not there.

05:17.723 --> 05:19.623
You must think I'm three kinds of crazy.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.338
No, not there.

05:22.294 --> 05:23.627
There.

05:26.798 --> 05:30.306
Alexa told me Bishop had his
eye on this spot a while back.

05:31.577 --> 05:32.870
Alexa told you that?

05:32.872 --> 05:34.905
Well, yeah, when she first
started coming,

05:34.907 --> 05:37.207
I pressed her about all the
details I could about Calvary.

05:37.209 --> 05:39.168
You know, hey, understandably.

05:39.945 --> 05:41.578
I guess I get that.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.982
Now, she also said that the city offered

05:44.984 --> 05:46.950
to sell this to Bishop and he passed?

05:49.387 --> 05:51.788
It was more complicated
than that, but...

05:51.790 --> 05:53.157
Hmm.

05:53.159 --> 05:55.025
I'm sure glad it was.

05:55.464 --> 05:56.827
First thing I did when I heard about it

05:56.829 --> 05:59.096
was I called up Deputy Mayor Leonard

05:59.098 --> 06:02.866
and told him my vision for this
Christian community center,

06:02.868 --> 06:04.955
and he sold me this land for a song.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.304
A song.

06:07.306 --> 06:08.338
It almost seemed like

06:08.340 --> 06:10.174
he was happy to take the loss

06:10.176 --> 06:12.209
just to teach your daddy a lesson.

06:13.366 --> 06:14.644
Yeah.

06:14.647 --> 06:15.879
Well, you know politicians.

06:15.881 --> 06:16.780
I ain't got time.

06:20.081 --> 06:22.451
You want me to be the public face

06:22.454 --> 06:23.987
of a $30 million...

06:23.989 --> 06:25.522
Well, no, actually 40,

06:25.524 --> 06:27.439
if we keep the indoor water park.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.360
$40 million?

06:30.362 --> 06:32.629
Christian community center.

06:36.401 --> 06:38.503
Right across from my daddy's church?

06:39.337 --> 06:41.937
No, the Lord wants you to do this.

06:44.675 --> 06:46.142
I'm just a messenger.

06:55.186 --> 06:56.820
How long have you lived here?

06:56.822 --> 06:59.759
Uh, about two months.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.627
<i>A friend of mine died
and I kind of took it over.</i>

07:06.496 --> 07:09.164
This is really going to help.

07:20.109 --> 07:21.977
Ahem.

07:21.979 --> 07:23.812
Will you excuse me just a second?

07:23.814 --> 07:24.980
Yes, sir.

07:38.062 --> 07:41.963
Are you okay?

07:41.965 --> 07:43.298
Are you okay?

07:47.171 --> 07:48.649
Are you all right?

07:49.139 --> 07:50.939
<i> Uh, yeah. Uh... uh-huh.</i>

07:55.144 --> 07:56.746
You talk to Janice?

07:56.771 --> 07:57.771
Woman: <i>Danielle's committed</i>

07:57.773 --> 07:59.748
<i>to making a statement at the hearing.</i>

08:00.250 --> 08:01.781
<i>I don't see anything stopping her.</i>

08:02.539 --> 08:03.505
<i>What about the bishop?</i>

08:06.756 --> 08:09.877
Well, might be time to talk to the DA.

08:21.887 --> 08:23.787
On your way to Women's Day?

08:23.789 --> 08:26.089
You know I wouldn't miss it.

08:26.091 --> 08:29.493
- Oh, hey, Kevin?
- Yeah?

08:29.495 --> 08:32.129
I need to find Henry
McCready a place to live

08:32.131 --> 08:33.530
and probably to die.

08:33.532 --> 08:34.936
Wow.

08:35.534 --> 08:37.200
Well, yeah, I got a friend at Foxbridge

08:37.202 --> 08:38.368
I can put a call in to if you want,

08:38.370 --> 08:39.703
you know, see if they have any space.

08:39.705 --> 08:40.971
That would be great. Thanks.

08:40.972 --> 08:42.139
Hey, how are the babies doing?

08:42.140 --> 08:44.942
Well, as long as Charity stays in bed,

08:44.944 --> 08:46.378
they'll be okay.

08:47.079 --> 08:49.473
- What about you guys?
- We're good.

08:50.449 --> 08:53.077
- You know.
- Well, you're off the couch, anyway.

08:53.079 --> 08:54.718
Yeah. How about you and Sophia?

08:54.720 --> 08:55.953
Hmm.

08:55.955 --> 08:57.654
Well, I'm actually planning

08:57.656 --> 08:59.189
on moving back to Phoenix
for the summer.

08:59.191 --> 09:02.426
Wow. Well, we'll miss you around here.

09:02.428 --> 09:04.795
I mean, you're the one
that's always coming to me

09:04.797 --> 09:06.721
asking for help for other people,

09:07.730 --> 09:09.787
and that's the Gospel
as far as I'm concerned.

09:10.668 --> 09:12.070
I guess that what I'm saying

09:12.095 --> 09:14.243
is do what you got to do.

09:15.340 --> 09:16.340
But come back, Grace.

09:18.476 --> 09:20.677
We'll see, but thank you.

09:20.679 --> 09:21.812
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you very much.

09:21.814 --> 09:23.486
And wish me some luck here.

09:23.488 --> 09:24.181
I'll try.

09:36.494 --> 09:37.828
Mae: <i>Let's just take a look</i>

09:37.830 --> 09:40.731
at this last verse here, verse 30.

09:40.733 --> 09:43.228
"Charm is deceptive

09:43.869 --> 09:46.620
and beauty is fleeting.

09:47.429 --> 09:51.008
But a woman who fears the Lord...

09:52.544 --> 09:54.411
...is to be praised."

09:56.047 --> 09:59.016
Now, wait a minute now.

09:59.018 --> 10:01.585
I know a lot of y'all
don't like this verse.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.820
Come on, now, admit it.

10:03.822 --> 10:06.693
<i>Yeah, because you love your charm.</i>

10:06.695 --> 10:09.760
Oh, we love our beauty, don't we?

10:09.762 --> 10:12.421
Ooh, I'm right with you.

10:13.198 --> 10:19.570
However, in a world where men
are stumping and shouting

10:19.572 --> 10:23.239
and taking most anything
they want by force,

10:23.264 --> 10:27.744
charm and beauty are some of
the most important weapons

10:27.746 --> 10:30.280
we have left to us.

10:30.282 --> 10:32.488
Isn't that right?

10:34.620 --> 10:37.587
So, why would the Lord ask us

10:38.046 --> 10:41.098
to give up those for fear?

10:42.461 --> 10:46.921
The Hebrew word that is translated here

10:46.923 --> 10:48.687
in this verse, "to fear"?

10:49.681 --> 10:54.938
It doesn't mean that cowering in
the corner kind of fear, you know?

10:54.940 --> 10:59.330
What this means is "awe."

11:00.034 --> 11:01.978
It means amazement.

11:02.929 --> 11:06.483
What it means is seeing life in a way

11:06.485 --> 11:10.912
that sometimes only a woman can.

11:12.491 --> 11:15.231
<i>Now, I pray without ceasing,</i>

11:15.233 --> 11:17.794
and one of the things that I always

11:17.796 --> 11:22.713
thank God for all day long is men.

11:26.421 --> 11:28.968
He has put powerful,

11:29.960 --> 11:33.009
strong, wonderful men in my life,

11:33.637 --> 11:35.070
and I'm grateful for them.

11:36.798 --> 11:41.470
But there are times when only a woman,

11:42.462 --> 11:47.657
a virtuous woman can save a situation.

11:49.236 --> 11:52.024
I'm talking about women like Mary.

11:54.124 --> 11:56.666
The mother of Jesus.

11:56.964 --> 12:00.337
Oh, she stood with her head held high

12:00.339 --> 12:05.008
amidst all that filthy gossip and rumors

12:05.010 --> 12:09.539
because she was filled with awe

12:10.500 --> 12:13.307
at what she knew to be the truth,

12:13.886 --> 12:18.588
which was God didn't give the
salvation of all humanity

12:18.590 --> 12:20.590
to some man to carry.

12:20.592 --> 12:24.127
He gave it to a woman.

12:27.231 --> 12:28.865
Amen!

12:28.867 --> 12:31.067
And this is the thing.

12:36.569 --> 12:39.075
Right now, our church
is at a crossroads.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.979
And I know...

12:42.981 --> 12:46.337
I know that the only way forward

12:48.138 --> 12:50.431
is in the footsteps of a virtuous woman.

12:51.147 --> 12:52.471
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

12:52.473 --> 12:56.386
A woman willing to stand
in awe and wonder

12:56.388 --> 12:58.695
at not only what God has done,

12:58.697 --> 13:01.097
but what He's going to do!

13:01.099 --> 13:05.202
A woman whose fear of the Lord

13:05.204 --> 13:06.803
makes her the Moses

13:06.805 --> 13:11.308
who's going to carry us
across the desert!

13:15.313 --> 13:20.605
The... a tested leader, y'all.

13:31.981 --> 13:33.982
Lord Jesus.

13:48.518 --> 13:49.918
It's so good to see you.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.488
I got us a room.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.917
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.055
What is it this time?

15:14.057 --> 15:18.225
Chicken breast on asparagus.

15:18.227 --> 15:19.460
Hmm.

15:19.462 --> 15:21.529
Dana made gumbo for dinner,

15:21.531 --> 15:24.145
but I told her it was too
much salt for my baby...

15:25.001 --> 15:26.567
and too much salt for my boys.

15:29.538 --> 15:30.910
Uh...

15:32.108 --> 15:33.989
what were you listening to?

15:35.178 --> 15:37.812
The song I had planned for next Sunday.

15:37.814 --> 15:40.748
I hate that I can't be there to sing it.

15:43.051 --> 15:44.685
Look.

15:45.788 --> 15:47.922
Charity, I've been doing some research.

15:47.924 --> 15:49.423
About what?

15:52.794 --> 15:54.595
About what I've been struggling with.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.302
I love you so much.

16:04.272 --> 16:05.506
I can't do this alone.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.276
What are you talking about?

16:23.959 --> 16:26.794
Fortitude for Families.

16:26.796 --> 16:28.040
What is this?

16:28.431 --> 16:29.769
It's a program...

16:31.100 --> 16:33.152
for guys who are...

16:34.470 --> 16:36.449
dealing with a similar issue.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.405
Issue?

16:40.408 --> 16:41.909
Just read it, Charity.

16:43.745 --> 16:44.778
No.

16:46.915 --> 16:48.533
I don't want to.

16:49.713 --> 16:51.193
You are what you are.

16:52.233 --> 16:53.754
You can't change that.

16:55.924 --> 17:00.594
Charity... please.

17:03.265 --> 17:04.765
Just read it.

17:10.872 --> 17:12.272
Okay.

17:15.343 --> 17:16.810
I'll read it.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.258
Thank you.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.586
Yeah.

17:46.621 --> 17:48.889
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:50.912 --> 17:52.313
I heard what happened today.

17:55.137 --> 17:57.438
Mama sent you to talk to me, huh?

17:57.463 --> 17:58.970
Oh, she did, indeed.

18:02.436 --> 18:03.833
You want me to stay?

18:04.427 --> 18:06.224
I can't believe you do after all this.

18:06.249 --> 18:07.882
Yeah, well, I can't
pretend that I'm over

18:07.907 --> 18:09.901
the way you disobeyed me.

18:11.801 --> 18:14.477
But the Bible is full of
bumptious troublemakers.

18:15.705 --> 18:17.004
Who the heck am I to say no

18:17.006 --> 18:18.505
if the spirit moves?

18:18.507 --> 18:19.950
It wasn't the spirit.

18:20.943 --> 18:21.781
You don't know that.

18:22.912 --> 18:25.309
You'll never know
what God's going to do.

18:28.516 --> 18:30.301
Daddy, I want to stay,

18:31.053 --> 18:33.754
and Sophia really wants to
come back in the fall,

18:35.070 --> 18:37.958
but the only way I can see
really making that happen

18:37.960 --> 18:40.394
is if I go back and stay
involved in her life there.

18:40.694 --> 18:43.207
- Gigi...
- Mama doesn't want me here.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.627
Well, that's not untrue.

18:49.425 --> 18:50.963
But, child, I'm going to
tell you something

18:52.294 --> 18:53.939
that only your mother knows.

18:59.794 --> 19:01.283
What's the matter, Daddy?

19:01.850 --> 19:03.147
Parkinson's.

19:08.590 --> 19:10.188
Look, don't worry.

19:10.860 --> 19:12.660
The stuff Dr. Curry's got me on

19:12.662 --> 19:13.986
has got it locked down pretty good,

19:14.357 --> 19:16.752
but I won't be able to preach
for too many more years.

19:17.746 --> 19:19.427
Tell Jacob. Bring him back.

19:19.452 --> 19:20.918
No.

19:20.943 --> 19:23.764
Your brother is just where he belongs.

19:24.907 --> 19:26.205
This is about you.

19:27.810 --> 19:29.143
I know when you came back here,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.801
all you wanted to do
was set things straight,

19:32.604 --> 19:35.916
and you did that... your way.

19:38.159 --> 19:39.532
But I know you, Gigi.

19:40.518 --> 19:42.444
I know you because I know myself.

19:43.893 --> 19:45.225
I'm a preacher.

19:46.728 --> 19:47.861
You're a preacher.

19:48.164 --> 19:49.930
And I believe this whole war

19:49.932 --> 19:52.052
between you and your mother
would just end

19:52.077 --> 19:56.947
if you pick up the cross of
your calling and carry it.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.662
Can you do that for me?

20:06.174 --> 20:07.241
Please?

20:28.069 --> 20:29.103
Daddy.

20:33.988 --> 20:34.916
This is really happening?

20:34.941 --> 20:37.382
- Yes, indeed, it is.
- Man.

20:37.384 --> 20:39.718
I've got to be out of here
one week from today.

20:39.720 --> 20:40.752
Just need you to sign.

20:41.326 --> 20:43.488
Mm.

20:43.491 --> 20:44.984
Thank you.

20:46.361 --> 20:47.871
Thank you, sir.

20:48.897 --> 20:51.437
I would offer you one of your
old Shirley Temples, but...

20:51.439 --> 20:53.132
But I see.

20:53.134 --> 20:54.400
Nothing to offer.

20:57.171 --> 20:58.771
So, what brings you down here?

20:58.773 --> 21:00.907
You wanted to see the place
for one last time?

21:00.909 --> 21:01.947
Yeah.

21:02.410 --> 21:04.477
You want to take that old
table you used to sit at

21:04.479 --> 21:07.783
and use it as your keepsake? Whoops.

21:08.438 --> 21:09.868
You knew they were going to do that.

21:10.139 --> 21:11.577
Kind of did.

21:12.587 --> 21:13.486
So, talk to me.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.663
Your father's dying.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.068
Is that why he's calling me?

21:27.093 --> 21:28.359
Yeah.

21:30.109 --> 21:32.604
- How do you know?
- He came by the church.

21:32.607 --> 21:34.006
Hmm.

21:34.008 --> 21:35.775
Guess that means you're really staying.

21:38.551 --> 21:40.585
At least for now, yeah.

21:42.916 --> 21:44.684
- Hmm.
- Hey.

21:46.820 --> 21:48.686
I'm going to be okay.

21:49.805 --> 21:51.863
Auntie, I'm going to be okay.

21:53.461 --> 21:55.014
We'll see.

21:56.964 --> 22:00.757
See... see, what you don't know

22:00.759 --> 22:05.385
is by the time you were born,

22:05.387 --> 22:06.440
your father was...

22:07.307 --> 22:09.775
he was who he is now.

22:10.149 --> 22:11.643
He was that man.

22:12.588 --> 22:14.013
But there was a time before you knew him

22:14.015 --> 22:19.135
when he was... he was somebody else.

22:19.137 --> 22:21.821
He just wanted to live

22:21.823 --> 22:23.356
and he wanted to experience

22:23.358 --> 22:25.992
all that God had created for us.

22:25.994 --> 22:28.861
He didn't want to stand apart from it

22:28.863 --> 22:34.467
and he didn't want to proclaim
the Gospel about it, and...

22:36.637 --> 22:39.498
...I never wanted that for you.

22:40.441 --> 22:41.898
I never did.

22:43.845 --> 22:46.279
And I never would've
led you down this path

22:46.281 --> 22:49.448
if I'd known it would.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.455
But what do I know?

22:59.293 --> 23:02.495
Well, I'm going tomorrow

23:02.497 --> 23:05.050
to move Henry to the hospice.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.400
You want to come?

23:07.402 --> 23:08.899
No.

23:10.571 --> 23:12.972
That story ended a long time ago.

23:21.219 --> 23:22.982
Y'all be careful with that.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.583
Those things cost money.

23:24.585 --> 23:25.918
Man: <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

23:43.537 --> 23:45.124
You think Basie's going to forgive you

23:45.126 --> 23:46.505
for not going to Triumph today?

23:46.507 --> 23:49.241
No, he knows it's Gigi's
first Sunday preaching,

23:49.243 --> 23:51.510
so he said take it.

23:51.512 --> 23:54.547
I think he's actually
hoping for a report.

23:54.549 --> 23:57.950
- What do you think?
- I think you should do it.

23:57.952 --> 24:00.186
<i>Even though it's right across the
street from my daddy's church?</i>

24:00.188 --> 24:01.487
But you said it's not a church.

24:01.489 --> 24:03.662
- Yeah...
- Not a traditional one.

24:04.559 --> 24:06.158
There's no guarantee
that a place like that

24:06.160 --> 24:08.461
is going to lure people away.

24:10.831 --> 24:12.621
Is he going to have a school?

24:13.334 --> 24:14.845
He didn't mention having one.

24:14.847 --> 24:16.269
Hmm.

24:17.338 --> 24:18.738
What do you think of suggesting

24:18.740 --> 24:21.222
a partnership with Excellence to him?

24:22.110 --> 24:23.510
What about Calvary?

24:23.945 --> 24:25.510
Bishop let you go,

24:25.913 --> 24:27.913
and we already have the curriculum
and the infrastructure,

24:27.915 --> 24:30.616
and it sounds like that place
is going to have the kids.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.470
You still worried about Alexa?

24:35.472 --> 24:39.625
No, I just thought it would
be fun working together.

24:44.889 --> 24:46.432
I'll bring it up to Basie.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.634
Okay.

24:56.610 --> 24:57.777
You look good.

25:08.355 --> 25:10.119
- Morning, Bishop.
- Morning.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.392
Pop! Wait up.

25:13.394 --> 25:14.726
Hey, son.

25:15.530 --> 25:18.564
Don't tell me that job at
Triumph went south already.

25:18.566 --> 25:19.799
No, no, no.

25:19.801 --> 25:20.933
We just came to hear Gigi.

25:20.935 --> 25:22.701
Oh, that's a good brother.

25:22.703 --> 25:25.604
Uh, there's something
I need to tell you, though.

25:30.944 --> 25:32.845
This project that Basie has me

25:32.847 --> 25:34.747
slated to run for him over at Triumph?

25:34.749 --> 25:35.748
Look, I can't wait to hear about it.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.383
Come on, Pop.

25:37.385 --> 25:39.118
It's going to be on that empty lot

25:39.120 --> 25:40.219
right across the street.

25:40.221 --> 25:42.190
You know the one?

25:42.949 --> 25:43.889
Yeah, I know the one.

25:43.891 --> 25:45.324
It's going to be a $40 million

25:45.326 --> 25:47.111
Christian community center.

25:47.962 --> 25:49.995
- I don't think I should do it.
- Oh, Jacob.

25:49.997 --> 25:52.064
I mean, I can't, not with you over here.

25:52.066 --> 25:55.935
Do you honestly think after all
that sidewinder has put me through

25:55.937 --> 25:59.205
that I would hand my beloved
only son to him without a plan?

25:59.207 --> 26:00.206
I'm not following.

26:00.208 --> 26:02.107
You just stay right there.

26:02.109 --> 26:03.642
Basie's just trying to get back at me.

26:03.644 --> 26:05.478
For what?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.179
Oh, I haven't the slightest idea.

26:07.181 --> 26:10.349
But with you as my eyes
and ears, we'll find out.

26:10.351 --> 26:14.854
And once we do, we'll march
seven times around that thing

26:14.856 --> 26:17.556
and it will all come tumbling down.

26:17.558 --> 26:19.435
But thanks for telling me about it.

26:19.927 --> 26:22.228
- Look, Pop?
- Mm-hmm?

26:22.230 --> 26:23.295
Was this always your plan?

26:23.297 --> 26:26.574
Oh, no, no, no. Not my plan.

26:27.902 --> 26:29.653
The Lord's.

26:30.505 --> 26:35.508
♪ The Master's calling

26:39.946 --> 26:44.916
♪ Praise Him while

26:58.852 --> 27:01.120
Did you tell that girl
to get out of the bed?

27:01.122 --> 27:02.582
I thought that you did.

27:02.991 --> 27:04.590
Children.

27:04.592 --> 27:08.797
It's like watching
a glacier fall apart on TV.

27:09.330 --> 27:10.396
Lord help me.

28:09.691 --> 28:10.890
Morning, Calvary.

28:10.892 --> 28:12.692
Crowd: <i>Good morning.</i>

28:12.694 --> 28:16.262
My mother blew the doors off
last weekend at Women's Day.

28:16.264 --> 28:18.499
I'm not going to try
and top that. No way.

28:20.334 --> 28:21.434
Way to go, Mommy.

28:25.572 --> 28:27.540
Amen, amen.

28:27.542 --> 28:30.209
All right, let's get right
into the word this morning.

28:30.802 --> 28:35.514
My text today is Romans 3:23.

28:36.003 --> 28:39.016
"For all have sinned and fallen
short of the glory of God."

28:39.018 --> 28:41.020
- Of course.
- Mae, shush now. Just listen.

28:41.022 --> 28:43.556
Now, before we get started,

28:44.019 --> 28:45.521
I need to talk about something.

28:45.523 --> 28:46.492
<i>As many of you know,</i>

28:46.494 --> 28:48.327
<i>a family member of ours
is currently in jail</i>

28:48.329 --> 28:51.803
awaiting sentencing
for a number of sexual crimes

28:51.805 --> 28:52.865
against young women.

28:55.829 --> 28:58.137
I hate talking about this in church,

28:58.917 --> 29:00.283
but it's real.

29:01.731 --> 29:03.153
Whew, it's real.

29:04.180 --> 29:07.013
And even after he's
sentenced and sent to jail,

29:07.640 --> 29:09.502
the fallout from his actions

29:09.504 --> 29:11.297
and from my family's reactions,

29:11.986 --> 29:13.085
<i>including mine,</i>

29:13.663 --> 29:15.689
will continue to haunt us
for a long time.

29:16.115 --> 29:17.540
And it should.

29:18.876 --> 29:20.826
And there will be
a time to talk about all of it,

29:21.660 --> 29:23.396
and there should be.

29:24.091 --> 29:25.322
But right now, this morning,

29:25.324 --> 29:26.730
I'd like to take a moment of silence

29:26.732 --> 29:28.805
for all the women that he did abuse,

29:28.807 --> 29:30.367
<i>the ones who are here,</i>

29:30.776 --> 29:32.328
those ones who came forward,

29:33.704 --> 29:35.274
the ones who haven't,

29:36.343 --> 29:37.943
the ones who are living...

29:40.856 --> 29:45.560
and the ones who, like my
sister Faith, have passed on.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.922
<i>A moment of silence for anyone here</i>

29:48.923 --> 29:51.324
<i>who is dealing with similar abuse,</i>

29:51.326 --> 29:52.825
<i>and a moment of silence</i>

29:53.289 --> 29:56.128
for anyone who knows
that something awful

29:56.130 --> 30:00.215
is happening to somebody close to them

30:00.769 --> 30:02.301
and they're not saying anything.

30:02.616 --> 30:05.571
<i>There's nothing I or anyone else can say</i>

30:05.573 --> 30:08.808
that can explain it adequately,

30:08.810 --> 30:10.943
honor it adequately...

30:13.280 --> 30:15.948
...grieve it adequately.

30:20.287 --> 30:24.156
Oh, but God...

30:26.427 --> 30:27.560
...but God!

30:29.163 --> 30:32.131
God is here. Could you
look at me right now?

30:32.133 --> 30:36.001
Even in the silence, God is here!

30:36.003 --> 30:38.304
So let's take our moment
of silence this morning,

30:38.306 --> 30:41.841
and when we're done,
let us promise ourselves

30:41.843 --> 30:43.676
and all of the abused around us,

30:43.678 --> 30:45.611
<i>all those victims,</i>

30:45.613 --> 30:47.413
that we will never be silent again.

30:47.415 --> 30:49.448
Woman: Amen!

30:49.450 --> 30:53.319
The silence ends today.

30:56.823 --> 30:58.891
Would you bow with me?

31:18.078 --> 31:19.111
And amen.

31:19.113 --> 31:20.479
Crowd: <i>Amen.</i>

31:20.481 --> 31:22.448
You ready for a new thing, Calvary?

32:00.020 --> 32:01.253
Are you lost?

32:02.042 --> 32:03.956
No, I'm not.

32:10.469 --> 32:12.436
It's smaller than I pictured it.

32:14.607 --> 32:15.607
What do you want, Mae?

32:16.249 --> 32:18.112
To ask the same thing of you.

32:19.941 --> 32:22.583
You think I don't know the
role you played in all this?

32:22.585 --> 32:24.698
You think I don't see your handprint

32:24.700 --> 32:26.306
on every brick of my ruin?

32:26.308 --> 32:29.152
Mac had to be stopped and you know it!

32:29.154 --> 32:30.983
You and that daughter of mine,

32:30.985 --> 32:33.173
dressing up all your resentments

32:33.175 --> 32:35.488
in robes of righteous indignation.

32:36.027 --> 32:38.005
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:38.007 --> 32:39.360
As a matter of fact, I never knew...

32:39.362 --> 32:42.795
You leave my family alone.

32:45.145 --> 32:46.345
The same way you did?

32:47.502 --> 32:49.417
If anybody's to blame for whatever it is

32:49.419 --> 32:51.837
you came down here to bitch to me about,

32:51.839 --> 32:54.571
it's you, because you knew.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.193
I did not know.

32:57.582 --> 32:58.373
You knew.

32:58.375 --> 33:00.072
How could I have known?

33:00.074 --> 33:01.432
Come on, you knew!

33:01.434 --> 33:02.715
How could any mother let that happen

33:02.717 --> 33:04.533
to her daughter and not say anything?

33:04.535 --> 33:05.913
You tell me.

33:05.915 --> 33:08.521
You charmless whore.

33:08.868 --> 33:10.838
What do you know about mothering?

33:10.840 --> 33:13.064
You don't know a thing about motherhood.

33:13.066 --> 33:15.147
Who are you to take me
to task like this?

33:15.149 --> 33:16.320
Who are you?

33:16.322 --> 33:18.315
Why didn't you say something?

33:18.317 --> 33:20.344
Why didn't you say anything?

33:20.346 --> 33:24.236
Why didn't you take your
daughter to the police

33:24.238 --> 33:27.129
when Grace told you 20 years ago?

33:27.131 --> 33:28.477
Why didn't you?

33:29.364 --> 33:30.709
I'll tell you why.

33:31.061 --> 33:32.211
Because you're like everybody else.

33:32.213 --> 33:34.213
You don't want to believe
it's your brother,

33:34.215 --> 33:36.937
your father, your son
could do such a thing.

33:36.939 --> 33:39.956
So they look the other way, and
that's exactly what you did.

33:39.958 --> 33:42.133
You looked the other way.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.096
You're no different than anybody else.

33:46.905 --> 33:50.896
- I didn't know.
- Get out.

33:51.605 --> 33:52.504
Get out.

33:54.434 --> 33:57.474
Come to me when you feel like

33:57.476 --> 33:58.699
you want to tell the truth,

33:58.701 --> 34:00.780
that you want to be honest.

34:01.851 --> 34:05.045
Because I am not going to
be your scapegoat.

34:06.204 --> 34:10.815
You brought this on yourself, so go!

34:39.830 --> 34:41.630
Well, how's it suit you?

34:41.632 --> 34:43.366
It fits.

34:43.368 --> 34:45.568
It'll be all right, I guess.

34:45.570 --> 34:47.870
They said they'll be ready
to take you whenever.

34:47.871 --> 34:50.739
- You know.
- I get it.

34:52.542 --> 34:54.043
And the church will pay for it.

34:56.359 --> 34:58.160
Does that daughter of mine know?

34:58.275 --> 35:00.075
She's aware.

35:02.152 --> 35:03.951
You know, I got to say it,

35:06.176 --> 35:08.377
I sure would like to see

35:08.785 --> 35:11.532
those girls before I die.

35:12.897 --> 35:14.917
I don't think that's going to happen.

35:15.833 --> 35:17.833
You're probably right.

35:20.904 --> 35:22.638
I guess it's time to let them go.

35:26.443 --> 35:27.553
Even Mac.

35:28.370 --> 35:29.679
Hmm.

35:30.090 --> 35:32.488
He didn't really give
a rat's ass about me.

35:32.490 --> 35:33.482
Nobody did.

35:33.844 --> 35:35.531
It seemed to me like he cared.

35:36.524 --> 35:37.688
He never obeyed Mama,

35:38.044 --> 35:39.556
always gave you money when he was asked.

35:40.132 --> 35:41.641
It wasn't love.

35:43.077 --> 35:47.871
It was just, you know, hush money.

35:51.147 --> 35:52.114
To keep quiet about what?

35:54.264 --> 35:55.164
Hey.

35:57.267 --> 35:58.990
To keep quiet about what?

36:00.377 --> 36:02.230
You're sure you want to know?

36:04.588 --> 36:05.487
Yeah.

36:08.388 --> 36:10.186
Remember when you was little

36:10.553 --> 36:12.707
and First Baptist burned down?

36:14.944 --> 36:16.102
Vaguely.

36:16.457 --> 36:19.614
And the caretaker was in the basement?

36:19.616 --> 36:20.821
What about it?

36:22.506 --> 36:24.606
That wasn't no act of God.

36:40.890 --> 36:41.924
No.

36:46.423 --> 36:47.323
You can stay.

36:59.736 --> 37:00.936
I want to talk.

37:12.813 --> 37:15.217
Kevin, I'm glad you told me the truth.

37:15.219 --> 37:16.585
Mm-hmm.

37:20.689 --> 37:23.155
But I think I need some time apart

37:25.168 --> 37:29.065
to just sit with it, be at peace.

37:31.134 --> 37:33.702
- For the babies.
- Okay.

37:36.406 --> 37:37.746
I'm sorry.

37:42.091 --> 37:43.925
I never meant to hurt you.

37:47.416 --> 37:48.416
I know that.

37:51.321 --> 37:54.423
I just think I might be...

37:57.360 --> 37:58.894
I know.

38:01.097 --> 38:02.731
I know.

38:23.336 --> 38:25.267
I'll see you in September.

38:25.349 --> 38:26.248
Yeah.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.626
- I hope so.
- Okay.

38:30.628 --> 38:31.894
Let's hit the road.

38:37.734 --> 38:40.650
- My sister.
- My sister.

38:48.845 --> 38:50.179
Come here, come here, come here.

38:50.181 --> 38:51.947
Come here.

38:54.114 --> 38:56.882
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

38:56.907 --> 38:58.240
I'll be fine, Mom.

39:03.093 --> 39:04.693
Have a little faith.

39:12.302 --> 39:14.003
You take care of her.

39:14.456 --> 39:15.472
I will.

39:19.168 --> 39:20.401
Let's go, Button. Come on.

39:35.525 --> 39:37.493
Faith: <i>When you're
disappointed in people,</i>

39:37.495 --> 39:39.428
<i>the one you should turn to is God,</i>

39:39.833 --> 39:41.430
<i>because God is perfect.</i>

39:41.432 --> 39:43.725
<i>God never disappoints.</i>

39:44.364 --> 39:45.868
<i>So, when we get all upset</i>

39:45.870 --> 39:49.338
<i>at our friends and our parents</i>

39:49.604 --> 39:51.373
<i>for not being perfect,</i>

39:51.375 --> 39:52.641
<i>we're missing the point.</i>

39:53.027 --> 39:54.910
<i>Nobody's perfect.</i>

39:55.123 --> 39:59.649
<i>This life God's given us
is not about perfection.</i>

40:00.284 --> 40:01.738
<i>It's about love.</i>

40:02.286 --> 40:04.419
Now you know how I feel...

40:05.682 --> 40:06.889
every day.

41:17.293 --> 41:18.894
What are you doing here?
