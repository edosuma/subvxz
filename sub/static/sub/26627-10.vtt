Your dad needs to stop with that bullshit.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.711
It shouldn't be on you
to take care of him and your brother.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.297
Maybe you should just let
the diner go under.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.715
Yeah, we should.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.553
But it's all he's got left of my mom.

you could always come
work with me full-time.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.364
-Pay off that grill in a week.
-No.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.408
Seriously. You're good at it.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.828
You and me together, we could
take this thing to the next level.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.248
You could hook up your family
and do shit for yourself.

Every now and then,
we could even go places.

Listen, Kevin and I will get by.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.107
Besides that, you know,
it's obvious you're bored here.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.359
It's affecting your work.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.864
Sorry, you have a problem with my work?

18:37.699 --> 18:41.703
[sighs] Well, you're late all the time.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.626
You go out most nights, running around
with that Todd Neiman loser.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.381
Do you think it's some big secret?

18:52.464 --> 18:54.007
That's none of your business.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.053
And you think
people don't know what he does?

18:59.179 --> 19:02.224
Do you think
that I don't know what he does?

19:02.307 --> 19:03.934
-[Kevin] Dad--
-He's the only person

19:04.017 --> 19:05.519
who gives a shit about how I feel.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.230
-[scoffs] He's a loser.
-Dad, she gets it.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.692
And what you do
reflects back on this family.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.986
You think that I don't want
to go to college?

19:14.903 --> 19:16.321
I can't go to college.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.949
If I leave here,
this place will go under in a week.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.492
-We'll be fine.
-[scoffs]

19:20.576 --> 19:22.828
You just bought a grill
that will bankrupt us.

19:22.911 --> 19:27.332
You know what? I'm... I'm sorry,
but Mom used to do everything around here,

19:27.416 --> 19:28.959
-and now I have to--
-Okay, guys, stop.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.253
No! You have no clue
how to run this place.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.297
-I run the front. I do the books.
-Karen, stop.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.091
-This is ridiculous.
-No, Dad, Dad. You are lost in a fog.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.636
The diner has been failing for years,
and you won't admit it.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.721
You keep clinging to it,

19:40.804 --> 19:42.931
'cause you think Mom's gonna
find her way back somehow.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.933
Well, if she does,
you're not gonna be here,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.519
-so it won't be your problem--
-Yeah, well, Mom hated this place.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.104
She hated this town, you never saw it.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.106
She loved this place. This was her home.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.359
No, she loved you.
That is the only reason she stuck around.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.529
She felt like she was dying here
a long time before she got cancer.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.577
You take that back.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.834
You ever wonder why Mom
kept buying lottery tickets? For somethin' to hope on
when she went into remission.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.421
You know what she was hoping?

20:14.504 --> 20:16.506
She was hoping
that if she ever got a second chance,

20:16.590 --> 20:18.133
she would get us the hell out of here.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.011
Well, Mom never got to find out,
so let's see, huh?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.429
Put that down!

20:27.643 --> 20:31.021
What do you think?
One scratch, and we pay off all the bills.

20:31.104 --> 20:35.234
One scratch, and we go our own way.
One last gift from Mom.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.238
Don't.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.031
Karen, please don't.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.843
Mom lost again.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.473
We all lose.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.226
Now we know.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.451
[breathing heavily]

21:28.078 --> 21:29.454
[vehicle approaching]

21:40.841 --> 21:43.844
-[softly] Hey. Shh... Hey.
-[Karen crying]

21:44.553 --> 21:45.554
Hey.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.056
-Let's get you out of here.
-Yeah.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.224
Okay?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.684
[Kevin] Where are you going?

21:50.767 --> 21:52.686
-You can't just leave!
-Kevin...

21:52.769 --> 21:54.813
[Todd] Shoulda asked her
before you sent that letter.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.441
-I'm not talking to you, asshole.
-Come on, let's just go.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.775
You're lucky your sister's hot.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.362
Hey, does Bernie know you sell, Todd?

22:02.446 --> 22:04.573
-Maybe he should.
-What the hell did you just say?

22:04.656 --> 22:06.867
-You heard me!
-Hey, hey! Hey, hey! No, no, no.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.911
Hey, hey, hey. I'd go to jail, too.
Is that what you want, Kevin?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.539
Just go inside. Come on, just go inside.

22:12.622 --> 22:15.292
Come on, let's go.
Please, let's go. Let's go.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.085
Just go inside, Kevin. Go.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.863
[rock music playing]

23:01.546 --> 23:02.964
[snorting]

23:05.884 --> 23:07.469
[coughing]

23:07.552 --> 23:08.887
[Todd snorts]

23:19.189 --> 23:21.149
Babe, take it easy.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.807
-What the hell?
-[gasps] Shit. Kevin?

23:55.392 --> 23:57.310
You stay the hell away from my sister!

23:57.394 --> 23:59.062
-[Todd] You're dead, asshole!
-[Karen] No!

23:59.146 --> 24:00.355
[grunting]

24:03.692 --> 24:05.610
[Kevin grunts, coughing]

24:09.322 --> 24:10.449
Shit.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.035
-Todd, no!
-[groans]

24:14.119 --> 24:15.287
No! Hey!

24:30.469 --> 24:31.761
You get away from him, Todd!

24:35.015 --> 24:36.391
-[shrieks]
-[grunts]

24:42.397 --> 24:43.982
Come on, come on, come on! Get up!

24:47.736 --> 24:48.987
Are you crazy?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.115
Okay. Okay.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.466
[panting]

25:12.761 --> 25:16.181
[trembling] Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
What's the matter with you?

25:16.973 --> 25:20.727
I was gonna fix it!
I was gonna fix it! You ruined it!

25:22.270 --> 25:24.064
Why? Why would you do that?

25:25.607 --> 25:26.691
Huh?

25:26.775 --> 25:30.028
[crying] Because... I already lost Mom.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.115
-Watch out!
-[screams]

25:45.669 --> 25:46.962
[gasps]

25:49.798 --> 25:51.633
[panting]

26:01.977 --> 26:02.978
Kev?

26:04.145 --> 26:05.313
Kevin!

26:07.983 --> 26:09.109
[crying]

26:32.007 --> 26:32.924
Dad.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.814
[Paxton wailing]

26:53.111 --> 26:54.321
[sobbing]

27:32.108 --> 27:33.443
[Paxton] You weren't there.

27:37.906 --> 27:38.907
What?

27:41.576 --> 27:44.329
Bernie is gonna say
it was just Kevin in the car.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.416
But...

27:49.084 --> 27:50.377
He's gonna omit...

27:52.379 --> 27:54.547
certain other details.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.554
He said we've suffered enough.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.853
[crying] Dad, I...

28:08.937 --> 28:10.689
You'd go to prison.

28:16.361 --> 28:19.239
Thank God your mother
wasn't alive for this.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.628
Reverend Shockne called...

28:35.547 --> 28:38.967
about Kevin's arrangements.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.177
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.722
No.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.853
I need you to, uh...

28:52.021 --> 28:53.231
[sighs]

28:58.445 --> 28:59.487
leave.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.411
I don't want you here, Karen.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.204
[sighs]

30:00.632 --> 30:01.966
[pill bottle opening]

30:13.937 --> 30:14.771
[creaking]

30:16.815 --> 30:19.025
-[breathing heavily]
-[footsteps approaching]

30:34.999 --> 30:36.209
Uh...

30:37.293 --> 30:38.294
Hi.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.129
You doing okay down here?

30:40.213 --> 30:41.339
[chuckles]

30:42.215 --> 30:43.216
Yeah. Thanks.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.722
Will it offend you if I say
I'll be glad to be gone?

30:49.806 --> 30:51.266
[both chuckle]

30:52.976 --> 30:54.769
Sister Maggie called.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.981
She said she'd have some options for you
by the end of the day.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.358
You'll be safe soon.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.151
[scoffs] If you say.

31:04.195 --> 31:09.242
Well, I'm getting ready to say Mass.
Um, you could come up if you'd like.

31:09.325 --> 31:12.036
Uh, no, no. Thank you. I'm not Catholic.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.538
Hell, if you get strict about it,

31:13.621 --> 31:15.498
neither are most of the people
who come here.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.751
That doesn't mean you shouldn't join us.

31:19.419 --> 31:23.214
A little ritual, a little ancient wisdom.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.092
Not the worst medicine
for a troubled soul.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.220
[scoffs]

31:30.930 --> 31:32.682
Jesus. Am I that transparent?

31:34.976 --> 31:39.606
Someone once said that everyone
is fighting a battle of their own...

31:40.523 --> 31:41.900
that you can't see.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.028
But sometimes...

31:48.865 --> 31:50.158
Sometimes...

31:52.952 --> 31:54.203
you can see.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.290
Yeah.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.465
Father, what do you do...

32:10.219 --> 32:12.180
when you realize that you've lost?

32:16.559 --> 32:17.685
[sighs]

32:21.773 --> 32:27.946
A man I helped raise as a boy
came to see me recently.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.156
Matt.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.117
I had...

32:34.118 --> 32:35.828
I had a choice of evils.

32:37.330 --> 32:43.252
He blames me for the ones I chose,
for the way his life turned out.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.840
I can't argue with him.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.135
I just have to find a way to live with it.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.977
Yeah, but how do you live with that?

33:01.562 --> 33:05.483
Knowing that you...
that you hurt someone like that?

33:06.526 --> 33:10.154
Well, you have to realize, Karen,
that whatever it is that you've done...

33:11.030 --> 33:12.448
or haven't done...

33:13.741 --> 33:15.576
it can still be redeemed.

33:21.457 --> 33:24.460
Yeah, that's nice,
but I'm not so sure that I believe that.

33:26.713 --> 33:33.469
"Everything will be okay in the end.
If it's not okay, it's not the end."

33:35.680 --> 33:38.641
John Lennon said that.
Who are we to argue with a Beatle?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.564
Do yourself a kindness. Come to Mass.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.449
[dispatch] <i>Karen Page is located</i>
<i>at the Clinton Church.</i>

33:54.532 --> 34:00.413
<i>Keep all NYPD units clear of that location</i>
<i>until otherwise advised. Copy.</i>

34:00.496 --> 34:02.957
There's one more thing
we need to do tonight.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.717
I don't let people know me.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.053
Very few have.

34:16.846 --> 34:21.434
There was one person,
an employee that I let become my friend.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.479
Eventually, he was like a son to me.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.938
James Wesley.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.399
-[softly] Yeah.
-I've read his file.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.529
You're like him in many ways.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.074
He, too, was always prepared.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.618
Aware of every detail.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.955
He anticipated my every need.

34:44.499 --> 34:45.500
He disappeared.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.210
He was murdered!

34:55.927 --> 35:01.015
When I sent you to the<i> Bulletin,</i>
it was to discredit Daredevil

35:01.099 --> 35:03.643
and the reporter who helped him
become a hero.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.605
I didn't know at the time,
but Karen Page killed Wesley.

35:12.860 --> 35:17.532
Mr. Fisk, if there's something
you want me to do...

35:18.199 --> 35:19.200
just ask.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.327
I want you to kill Karen Page.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.626
Consider it done.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.181
What does Fisk want with Karen?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.725
He wants her killed.

35:50.356 --> 35:51.983
[Lantom] Well, good evening, everyone.

35:52.066 --> 35:55.486
I just want to take a moment
before the service starts

35:56.279 --> 35:59.574
to thank you all for coming out tonight.

36:00.158 --> 36:04.328
The events of recent days
have been deeply troubling.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.748
Especially for us, here in Hell's Kitchen.

36:11.961 --> 36:15.506
He's downstairs.
There are no cameras in the bedroom.

36:15.590 --> 36:16.924
No, no. God...

36:17.967 --> 36:19.260
[muttering]

36:21.512 --> 36:22.638
[stammers] How long?

36:22.722 --> 36:23.639
What? What are--

36:23.723 --> 36:25.224
-How long until he gets here?
-Seconds.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.392
[exhales sharply]

36:27.977 --> 36:29.896
If you leave,
I have to tell him you were here.

36:29.979 --> 36:32.773
-He'll triple security.
-No, no...

36:32.857 --> 36:35.026
Getting back in here will be impossible.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.321
You'll never have
another chance like this.

36:40.489 --> 36:43.910
-Where are we going, Dex?
-Just keep going straight.

36:45.703 --> 36:49.332
Institutions we trust have been attacked.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.627
Innocent people have been killed.

36:53.669 --> 36:57.673
Wait for me over there.
Keep the car running. I'll be back soon.

36:58.591 --> 36:59.759
What are you gonna do?

37:02.136 --> 37:04.639
Don't worry, partner. I'll do us proud.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.101
[Lantom] <i>We have been called upon</i>
<i>to question</i>

37:09.185 --> 37:12.688
whether the people we thought
were fighting for us...

37:14.482 --> 37:16.817
were really monsters all along.

37:17.693 --> 37:21.447
<i>We are being told</i>
<i>that we are not strong...</i>

37:22.156 --> 37:23.491
<i>that we are not safe.</i>

37:23.908 --> 37:25.451
You do what you have to do.

37:27.286 --> 37:30.915
Yet... here we are.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.837
Stronger, because we will not accept
that we are weak.

37:37.380 --> 37:41.050
Safer, because we will not be divided.

37:41.592 --> 37:45.429
I am proud of all of you for coming here
despite your fears.

37:46.847 --> 37:50.518
And I am grateful to you, always...

37:52.311 --> 37:54.689
for letting me call myself one of you.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.236
Even when the night is darkest--

38:00.319 --> 38:02.071
[Dex] Karen Page!

38:14.000 --> 38:16.627
Where is...

38:18.045 --> 38:20.172
Karen Page?

38:25.469 --> 38:26.345
[grunts]

38:26.429 --> 38:27.388
[attendees screaming]

38:31.684 --> 38:32.935
[woman] It's locked!

38:33.019 --> 38:35.438
-Go back! Turn around!
-Go back.

38:36.939 --> 38:38.733
[Lantom] All right, hurry up! Hurry!

38:41.235 --> 38:42.403
I'm here!
