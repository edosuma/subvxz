WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:02.245
This is just wonderful.

00:02.311 --> 00:04.547
First my wife tells me
that she's lost everything,

00:04.613 --> 00:06.615
now my grandson is telling me that

00:06.682 --> 00:09.119
he's nothing but a common crook.

00:09.918 --> 00:13.456
Is that why you brought that
safecracker in, to rob us?

00:13.522 --> 00:14.623
No.

00:16.681 --> 00:17.849
No.

00:17.917 --> 00:21.092
- I was trying to help you.
- Oh.

00:21.117 --> 00:22.650
I can still help you.

00:22.675 --> 00:24.209
Really.

00:24.234 --> 00:27.059
This is from the Einstein
that tried to rob a gun range.

00:27.126 --> 00:28.460
I did that on purpose.

00:28.527 --> 00:30.095
There were... there
were bad men after me,

00:30.162 --> 00:31.937
and getting arrested was
the only way out of it.

00:31.962 --> 00:33.797
So we have to worry about these bad men?

00:33.864 --> 00:35.508
No, you don't have to
worry about the bad...

00:35.533 --> 00:36.600
they don't even know who I am.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.784
I was going under an alias.

00:38.809 --> 00:41.045
Marius Josipovic.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.374
Jos... wh... what
kind of a name is that?

00:43.441 --> 00:44.808
It's Polish.

00:45.643 --> 00:47.149
You said you could help.

00:50.507 --> 00:53.277
My ex told you about a friend, right?

00:53.344 --> 00:55.312
Uh, Victoria Gemmet.

00:55.379 --> 00:56.917
He said she was a client.

00:56.942 --> 00:58.528
He said she had an opportunity,

00:58.553 --> 01:00.853
a real estate opportunity, but
she couldn't take advantage of it

01:00.878 --> 01:02.052
because she didn't have the cash.

01:02.153 --> 01:05.456
And said she had a boyfriend
on the planning commission,

01:05.522 --> 01:09.560
that Google was gonna open some
super campus outside of Bridgeport,

01:09.626 --> 01:12.731
and that the... the value
of the surrounding property

01:12.756 --> 01:14.021
was gonna skyrocket.

01:14.064 --> 01:16.433
Oh, Jesus, Audrey, you work
with criminals every day.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.501
How could you fall for this?

01:17.568 --> 01:19.903
Because I got paid. I told you.

01:19.970 --> 01:22.972
I put in 10,000 and got
back 15,000 in five days.

01:22.997 --> 01:24.375
Easy money's always the hook.

01:24.441 --> 01:26.777
And then you told Lance that
if there was another opportunity

01:26.843 --> 01:28.279
to let you know about it right away.

01:28.345 --> 01:30.080
How long did he wait, what, two weeks?

01:30.181 --> 01:32.015
Three. Same type of deal.

01:32.082 --> 01:34.017
But bigger, right?

01:34.084 --> 01:36.853
Yeah, a lot bigger. A lot.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.656
Lance said Victoria's boyfriend
found out about the property,

01:39.723 --> 01:43.193
and he was terrified he'd get
charged with insider trading

01:43.194 --> 01:44.861
for giving her the information.

01:44.928 --> 01:47.731
Right, so then she needed
to sell the properties fast.

01:47.798 --> 01:51.101
She said there were other
investors that were interested,

01:51.202 --> 01:53.370
but because you helped her out before,

01:53.437 --> 01:55.525
she came to you first.

01:55.550 --> 01:56.919
Right?

01:59.042 --> 02:01.044
Put it like that, it's just...

02:01.111 --> 02:03.880
so... so obvious.

02:03.947 --> 02:07.217
They call this the Spanish
Prisoner. It's an old con.

02:07.242 --> 02:09.220
This... the same thing happened to me.

02:09.286 --> 02:11.221
There's always a clock on it.

02:11.222 --> 02:15.025
I had one day to come up with 175,000.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.394
So I...

02:17.879 --> 02:20.687
got Dockery's money,

02:21.398 --> 02:23.814
his cash out of the safe and...

02:24.301 --> 02:28.460
and, um, I-I pawned some collateral...

02:28.939 --> 02:30.523
to come up with the rest.

02:32.390 --> 02:33.792
What the fuck?

02:33.817 --> 02:37.047
Jesus Chris, Audrey. You
said you told me everything.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.515
I didn't want to upset you.

02:38.582 --> 02:41.623
You pawned collateral.
How could you do that?

02:41.648 --> 02:43.587
Because Lance said it...

02:43.654 --> 02:45.289
Lance said he was going with me,

02:45.356 --> 02:47.258
that it was too rich to pass up.

02:47.324 --> 02:49.729
This is a betrayal of everything!

02:49.754 --> 02:51.528
- It was a chance to...
- It's a betrayal of our marriage!

02:51.595 --> 02:54.030
- It's a chance to get even.
- It's a betrayal of our business!

02:54.097 --> 02:56.197
It was a chance to catch up,

02:56.222 --> 02:58.101
to maybe even get ahead for once.

02:58.135 --> 02:59.913
Between your medical bills, and...

02:59.938 --> 03:01.429
and this hand-to-mouth
business, I just...

03:01.505 --> 03:03.762
Oh, I didn't realize
I was such a burden.

03:03.787 --> 03:05.700
Oh, Otto, I'm sorry.

03:05.742 --> 03:09.746
In two days, Audrey, two,

03:09.813 --> 03:12.883
Dockery will come lookin' for his money,

03:12.949 --> 03:14.641
and we will not have it.

03:16.119 --> 03:20.324
- Grandpa.
- I don't want to hear from you.

03:23.294 --> 03:25.325
Well, shit, I, um...

03:26.663 --> 03:30.734
my final Agent Orange
check came yesterday.

03:30.801 --> 03:34.295
I think I'll just go cash it right now.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.308
You think $5,000 is gonna help?

03:37.374 --> 03:38.509
Where are you going?

03:38.575 --> 03:39.976
I'm going to work.

03:40.043 --> 03:42.546
For as long as we still have a business.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:00.664 --> 04:02.399
What are we gonna do?

04:07.838 --> 04:09.673
We're gonna get your money back.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.065
Chayton, how are you?

05:25.090 --> 05:27.818
Been thinkin' about
your visit yesterday.

05:27.884 --> 05:29.085
Tellin' me to run.

05:30.421 --> 05:31.988
Didn't feel right.

05:32.055 --> 05:35.425
- I was only, uh...
- Lookin' out for my father.

05:35.426 --> 05:37.694
To be a friend.

05:37.761 --> 05:40.478
Spare him the pain of
seeing his son in jail.

05:41.899 --> 05:43.967
When did you last see my father,

05:44.034 --> 05:45.135
before yesterday?

05:45.201 --> 05:47.018
Well, uh...

05:48.505 --> 05:50.306
I'm feelin' you lied to me.

05:50.441 --> 05:51.508
About what?

05:51.575 --> 05:54.578
Maybe the reason you
want me out of here.

05:54.652 --> 05:57.120
I skip town, you keep the money.

05:57.180 --> 05:59.215
- That'd be stupid.
- Yeah, that would be.

05:59.282 --> 06:02.578
The witness is not gonna
show up on Monday, or Tuesday,

06:02.603 --> 06:04.555
or any day.

06:04.621 --> 06:08.358
And after my court hearing
on Monday, I'm gonna return.

06:08.459 --> 06:10.189
I want my money ready.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.439
Why? Because my angel-faced little
cousin Carly is the fucking devil.

06:19.464 --> 06:20.871
She's the one who took it to Audrey.

06:20.937 --> 06:23.106
And apparently, she's also
been talking to Taylor about me.

06:23.173 --> 06:26.342
Well, then, you have a major
crack in the damn, Marius,

06:26.367 --> 06:28.870
because that cop is
gonna run Pete's name

06:28.902 --> 06:29.953
sooner rather than later,

06:30.013 --> 06:32.716
and it's not gonna be your
face that pops up, is it?

06:32.783 --> 06:34.885
If the truth comes out,
it's gonna be a shit storm

06:34.951 --> 06:38.188
to end all shit storms, because
you'll go back to prison.

06:38.254 --> 06:40.791
And Eddie can say
goodbye to his fingers.

06:40.896 --> 06:42.297
So I don't... what do I do?

06:42.325 --> 06:43.853
I don't know what to do.

06:43.878 --> 06:45.829
Well, I have an idea.

06:46.563 --> 06:48.164
You're not gonna like it.

06:48.231 --> 06:50.934
Uh, what, Porter? You want...
you want me to talk to...

06:51.001 --> 06:52.836
he wants nothing to do with me.

06:52.903 --> 06:54.705
Tell him what we're doing.

06:54.771 --> 06:56.540
But is it... he's not
even the same anymore.

06:56.607 --> 06:57.874
I don't understand.

06:57.941 --> 06:59.863
Maybe not, but...

07:00.214 --> 07:02.879
he knows how to find the
kind of person you need.

07:02.969 --> 07:06.895
There... there are four
steps to this trick.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.988
Four.

07:08.013 --> 07:09.720
I need a volunteer.

07:09.786 --> 07:11.988
Wallace. Come, come, come, Wallace.

07:12.055 --> 07:14.524
Wallace, ladies and gentlemen.

07:14.525 --> 07:15.525
Wallace.

07:15.526 --> 07:16.893
It's Wally.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.762
- Wally.
- Yeah.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.531
Nice to work with you, Wally.

07:20.564 --> 07:22.432
- Yeah, thank you.
- Please, ladies and gentlemen.

07:24.234 --> 07:28.138
All right, as I said, there
are four steps to this trick.

07:28.204 --> 07:30.006
Step number one:

07:30.073 --> 07:34.845
pour the milk into the cup.

07:36.244 --> 07:38.800
All right. There we go.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.300
Hah?

07:41.130 --> 07:43.998
Um, next step.

07:44.269 --> 07:45.952
Place the cards...

07:46.683 --> 07:48.718
over the milk.

07:49.159 --> 07:50.994
Step number three:

07:51.061 --> 07:53.793
place the cup of milk...

07:54.483 --> 07:57.257
on Wally's head.

07:57.307 --> 07:59.442
- Ooh.
- There.

07:59.570 --> 08:01.605
Step number four:

08:03.006 --> 08:05.041
uh, step number four is, uh...

08:07.362 --> 08:08.879
pull the cards.

08:08.945 --> 08:11.347
Uh... let's see.

08:11.414 --> 08:13.083
Ahh!

08:13.149 --> 08:15.559
Yeah, give him a round of applause.

08:15.584 --> 08:16.662
Give him a round of applause.

08:16.687 --> 08:18.221
Great job, Wally, great job.

08:18.288 --> 08:20.023
Let's clean you off there.

08:20.090 --> 08:22.192
Good job.

08:32.371 --> 08:33.472
Porter.

08:36.371 --> 08:37.674
It's Marius.

08:39.442 --> 08:41.712
You don't remember me?

08:42.779 --> 08:44.014
I'm your old student.

08:59.129 --> 09:00.463
Marius.

09:00.530 --> 09:04.500
Yeah, that... you told me that
was the first trick you learned.

09:04.635 --> 09:07.637
Now I get halfway through
a gag and can't finish it.

09:07.638 --> 09:09.032
You're still there.

09:09.057 --> 09:10.643
Am I?

09:11.029 --> 09:12.531
Let's see.

09:12.876 --> 09:15.511
I can't remember the short
con, never mind the long.

09:15.646 --> 09:20.183
I'm reduced to kissing the
dog at the retirement centers.

09:21.818 --> 09:23.186
Yeah, but you look fantastic.

09:23.253 --> 09:25.922
And you're a good liar.

09:28.725 --> 09:33.129
Say, um... I hate to ask this but,

09:33.196 --> 09:35.398
you know things haven't
been going too well for me,

09:35.465 --> 09:37.868
and I...

09:37.934 --> 09:40.464
- I was just wondering...
- Yeah.

09:40.771 --> 09:43.718
Yeah, here. I got a, uh...

09:43.743 --> 09:45.308
Got a 20.

09:47.210 --> 09:48.812
What you say your name was?

09:50.947 --> 09:52.932
Uh, it's not important.

09:53.297 --> 09:55.018
Just an old friend.

09:56.653 --> 09:59.255
Well, thank you. Thank you.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.764
Mm, nice Rolex.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.433
Some grandson's gonna miss you.

11:21.727 --> 11:23.102
Nice haul.

11:32.115 --> 11:34.622
I really did learn from the best.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.422
That's my business card.

11:39.489 --> 11:41.825
Got your address from the phone book.

11:41.892 --> 11:43.159
What do you want?

11:43.226 --> 11:44.427
Want your 20 back?

11:44.494 --> 11:45.896
I didn't give you a 20.

11:49.065 --> 11:51.167
I only do what the nursing staff does.

11:51.234 --> 11:53.169
Just do it with more flair, that's all.

11:53.244 --> 11:55.446
- I'm not here to judge.
- But you're here for something.

11:58.141 --> 12:00.376
I'm... I'm looking for a, uh...

12:00.401 --> 12:04.092
a gray hat, 'cause I...
I need to hack into a...

12:04.117 --> 12:05.816
a prison data base.

12:05.882 --> 12:07.884
That'll cost you more than 20.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.877
You don't get it, do you?

12:28.312 --> 12:30.948
I don't want to help you.

12:30.973 --> 12:32.107
Ever.

12:34.744 --> 12:36.913
Charlie...

12:36.980 --> 12:39.315
You don't get to say
nothin' about Charlie.

12:39.382 --> 12:42.085
We were spinning cards
while you were drinking milk

12:42.152 --> 12:45.357
from your mother's heroin tainted titty.

12:47.858 --> 12:51.394
Nothin' made me happier than the
day he asked me to call him brother.

12:51.461 --> 12:52.628
Me.

12:52.695 --> 12:54.330
Nothing.

12:54.397 --> 12:58.469
And you. You put those
bullets in his chest.

12:58.635 --> 13:02.873
So if you're gonna stand there,
and do something productive, own it.

13:02.939 --> 13:04.107
Own it!

13:05.341 --> 13:08.251
We're going after the
guy who killed Charlie.

13:08.644 --> 13:10.713
If I don't make a change
to a certain prison record,

13:10.780 --> 13:12.115
the whole thing falls apart.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.917
I ain't interested in
joining no justice league

13:13.984 --> 13:15.285
with you callin' the shots.

13:15.351 --> 13:17.553
I don't think anybody
else would, either.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.522
Joseph is onboard.

13:19.589 --> 13:21.058
So is Marjorie.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.284
Horse shit.

13:22.309 --> 13:24.060
Call her. Right now.

13:24.127 --> 13:26.897
Call her. This was her idea.

13:27.719 --> 13:30.055
We're doin' the Dirk.

13:30.566 --> 13:32.168
There's no moving parts.

13:35.906 --> 13:38.108
Now I know it's horse shit.

13:38.174 --> 13:40.920
He's gonna do Dirk.

13:41.524 --> 13:45.728
Porter. Porter. We need your help.

13:49.752 --> 13:50.756
What?

13:50.781 --> 13:53.013
I don't really like the... the no beard.

13:53.056 --> 13:54.290
I like it when you were, like, hairy

13:54.357 --> 13:56.259
with a, like, a lumberjack kind of.

13:56.326 --> 13:57.793
You know what? I love you.

13:57.928 --> 13:59.295
I love you, too.

13:59.362 --> 14:01.264
All right, go give that
other team that attitude.

14:01.331 --> 14:02.632
- All right.
- Right.

14:02.698 --> 14:05.377
All right, we will pick
you up right out front,

14:05.402 --> 14:06.402
in front of the building, okay?

14:06.469 --> 14:08.371
- All right.
- Yeah. You got your water bottle?

14:08.438 --> 14:09.505
Yes.

14:12.575 --> 14:14.945
- Knock 'em dead.
- Hey, hey, hey.

14:15.011 --> 14:17.580
Oh. Excuse me. What's our code?

14:17.647 --> 14:19.782
Benders wheel, grinders carry.

14:19.849 --> 14:21.284
Uh-huh.

14:22.953 --> 14:24.220
Where's Moe?

14:26.022 --> 14:27.557
He makes a shot.

14:29.659 --> 14:32.222
Christ sakes, Moe, why
don't you have your office

14:32.247 --> 14:33.582
on the first floor?

14:33.607 --> 14:36.066
Eh, Lieutenant Bernhardt.

14:36.132 --> 14:37.424
Good to see you.

14:37.449 --> 14:38.568
How you been, Moe?

14:38.634 --> 14:41.871
Ah, you know. Trying to
watch what I eat, exercise.

14:41.972 --> 14:43.974
Well, I was gonna
say, you look... huh...

14:44.040 --> 14:45.611
you look svelte.

14:45.636 --> 14:46.776
Fuck you, old man.

14:48.551 --> 14:50.353
So, what's goin' on?

14:50.735 --> 14:52.170
Uh...

14:54.630 --> 14:57.666
I need to find someone
who paints houses.

15:02.367 --> 15:05.237
It's a big fuckin' ask.

15:05.262 --> 15:08.682
Well, I know that.

15:09.611 --> 15:11.436
But I'm asking.

15:13.003 --> 15:14.437
I wish I could help.

15:14.992 --> 15:16.432
Those connections I ain't got no more.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.190
That's a crock of shit and you know it.

15:18.215 --> 15:20.510
- Otto.
- I bailed out your brother last year.

15:20.576 --> 15:24.614
He got caught with 12
fully automatic MP5s.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.545
You gonna tell me that those
were headed for an orphanage?

15:27.570 --> 15:28.972
Hey, hey. Hey.

15:28.997 --> 15:34.069
Do you know that I collect
military memorabilia?

15:34.390 --> 15:37.060
Two years ago, I got my hands on

15:37.127 --> 15:39.829
an original 1916 proclamation

15:39.895 --> 15:42.398
issued by the Irish volunteers

15:42.465 --> 15:45.435
in the Irish Citizen Army.

15:45.501 --> 15:48.338
During the Easter rebellion.

15:48.404 --> 15:50.624
Did I say it was an original?

15:51.053 --> 15:53.212
Signed by Patrick Pierce?

15:55.950 --> 15:57.950
Do this for me,

15:58.686 --> 16:00.955
and it's yours.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.341
Hey.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.094
Hey, my name's Taylor.

16:08.124 --> 16:11.461
You... you guys got a
camera out front, right?

16:11.527 --> 16:13.598
You know if it covers Bruno's?

16:13.623 --> 16:15.525
Sure, it covers Bruno's.

16:15.550 --> 16:17.886
Okay. Okay, good, look.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.910
I got... I got in this little, uh...

16:19.935 --> 16:23.057
this little thing with these
knuckleheads the other night.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.975
And the cops are
taking for fucking ever.

16:26.076 --> 16:28.678
Do you know if there's any way
I could get a copy of the video?

16:28.759 --> 16:32.097
- Sure is.
- Yes, that would be great.

16:33.749 --> 16:36.413
Okay. Okay, so...

16:36.437 --> 16:38.087
how do I get it?

16:38.088 --> 16:40.490
Let me think. Uh...

16:40.556 --> 16:43.937
you can suck on a binga,
and then you come back,

16:43.962 --> 16:45.595
then you'll get the video.

16:47.829 --> 16:49.264
Binga means dick.

16:54.002 --> 16:55.337
You know what this means.

16:55.362 --> 16:56.898
- Hm? Huh?
- Oh, sure.

16:56.923 --> 16:58.524
That means you got no chill.

16:58.549 --> 16:59.884
What?

16:59.909 --> 17:03.146
Socio. Avon's a friend.

17:03.213 --> 17:05.548
I know he filed a
complaint against your ass.

17:05.615 --> 17:06.816
You're benched.

17:06.882 --> 17:09.385
So that badge don't mean shit.

17:09.460 --> 17:12.363
So take your JC Penney
Sunday best and go.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.757
You better watch your fuckin' mouth.

17:14.824 --> 17:17.127
Maybe you better watch yours.

17:32.133 --> 17:34.376
Telling me that, um...

17:34.901 --> 17:37.637
his prison number has been changed.

17:38.013 --> 17:41.284
They say they can't do
anything without his new number.

17:43.686 --> 17:45.353
I thought you said they were good.

17:45.378 --> 17:46.989
Yeah, Latvian good.

17:47.056 --> 17:49.601
Reason I asked for this, Eddie,

17:49.950 --> 17:52.328
not that I doubt you have skills,

17:52.395 --> 17:56.266
but I never take a man's
word on faith alone.

17:56.332 --> 18:01.070
So, how you gonna
spot Mukherjee's cheat?

18:01.171 --> 18:02.305
I don't know.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.877
But it takes a cheat...

18:16.619 --> 18:18.174
to spot...

18:19.054 --> 18:20.523
a cheat.

18:24.310 --> 18:25.945
Where's the ace?

18:26.529 --> 18:29.934
On top of the deck. You
were dealing off the bottom.

18:31.932 --> 18:33.099
All right.

18:33.436 --> 18:34.670
Okay, one more.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.260
What'd I do?

19:03.512 --> 19:04.780
Look at your hand.

19:09.102 --> 19:10.606
That's good.

19:10.673 --> 19:12.542
I'm gonna control the table,

19:12.608 --> 19:15.244
feed Mukherjee whatever cards I want.

19:15.245 --> 19:17.179
- See what he plays.
- No.

19:17.204 --> 19:19.038
That makes us the cheaters.

19:19.081 --> 19:21.551
No. Just deal 'em straight. All right?

19:21.617 --> 19:23.877
Spot the cheat, that's all.

19:23.941 --> 19:25.734
Nothin' fancy.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.219
He's good.

19:30.244 --> 19:31.445
Yeah.

19:31.894 --> 19:34.831
I hope Marius has
that money in two days.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.367
I'd hate to ruin those hands.

19:40.336 --> 19:43.172
Amanda. I told her to be out front.

19:43.273 --> 19:45.217
It's fine, I'll get her.

19:57.620 --> 19:58.754
Wait, wait, wait.

19:58.821 --> 20:01.039
I... I need to talk to you.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.984
So you just let her go
off with... with a man?

20:11.267 --> 20:13.403
Amanda. Amanda!

20:16.229 --> 20:18.531
- Hey, bug.
- Hey.

20:18.556 --> 20:21.311
- Hey, how ya doin'?
- Good.

20:21.377 --> 20:22.778
Um, are we in trouble?

20:22.845 --> 20:24.314
- No, no, no. Course not.
- No.

20:24.387 --> 20:26.189
No, sweetie, we just, uh...

20:26.214 --> 20:29.251
we need to talk to the detective.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.854
Could you please go finish
that in your bedroom?

20:31.921 --> 20:33.956
- Yeah.
- Thank you, sweetie.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.339
You son of a bitch.

20:38.364 --> 20:41.105
This is about Marius, not your family.

20:41.130 --> 20:42.498
No, you made it about my family

20:42.565 --> 20:44.632
- when you took my girl.
- Stop it. Stop it.

20:45.281 --> 20:47.049
If you didn't have that gun,

20:47.074 --> 20:49.032
I'd shove that fucking
up behind your skull.

20:49.057 --> 20:51.136
Honey, Amanda...

20:51.161 --> 20:52.508
Amanda is fine.

20:52.575 --> 20:54.109
Look at me. She's fine.

20:54.176 --> 20:56.245
Okay? She's fine.

20:56.346 --> 20:57.347
What do you want?

20:57.413 --> 20:59.148
I want you to help me get Marius.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.451
- He's not a good guy.
- We don't know where he's at.

21:01.517 --> 21:03.353
- Your wife does.
- No, she doesn't.

21:03.419 --> 21:07.590
She takes me to him, I am a memory.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.115
I can get you his address.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.462
- Okay?
- Nah, too many variables.

21:12.528 --> 21:14.630
Wrong address, you
call ahead and warn him.

21:14.697 --> 21:17.671
Only way this works, you take me.

21:17.766 --> 21:19.869
- No.
- It's fine.

21:19.935 --> 21:21.837
- Honey, no.
- Fine. It's fine.

21:21.904 --> 21:23.742
I have dealt with worse.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.607
There. Everybody wins.

21:29.727 --> 21:31.768
I'm just gonna need your cell phones.

21:37.479 --> 21:38.821
Marius.

21:38.888 --> 21:42.492
- Hey.
- Shit. What are you doing here?

21:42.558 --> 21:44.259
Here to see an old friend.

21:44.394 --> 21:45.428
So could you go get him for me?

21:45.495 --> 21:47.029
His name is Salty McGee.

21:48.264 --> 21:50.232
No, I'm... I'm here to see you, Pete.

21:50.299 --> 21:52.301
I'm kidding.

21:52.402 --> 21:54.837
Screw you.

21:54.912 --> 21:57.061
Wow. What's goin' on?

21:57.094 --> 21:58.981
So, who... who are you stayin' with?

21:59.006 --> 22:01.227
Uh, uh, family.

22:01.252 --> 22:02.619
That's good.

22:02.945 --> 22:05.147
- So, how you been?
- Good. I, uh...

22:05.210 --> 22:08.114
I found this youth intervention
program out in Jamaica Queens.

22:08.150 --> 22:10.285
So I'm thinkin' about workin' with them.

22:10.310 --> 22:13.362
No shit, huh? Wow. Prison changed you.

22:13.409 --> 22:16.267
Well, you know, self-respect
isn't a straight line,

22:16.292 --> 22:17.759
it's a circle.

22:20.062 --> 22:21.664
That's what they teach the kids.

22:21.731 --> 22:24.700
They're, uh, mostly pre-teens.

22:24.767 --> 22:26.902
Uh, you know, 11-year-olds.

22:26.969 --> 22:29.071
You remember the puberty years, right?

22:30.606 --> 22:33.083
Oh, yeah. No, I sure do.

22:33.108 --> 22:35.755
That's a big jump from 10 to 11. Right?

22:35.780 --> 22:38.956
Ten, you're, um, you know,
you're watching cartoons,

22:38.981 --> 22:42.217
eleven, the fuzz on your
nuts starts to mean something.

22:42.284 --> 22:44.119
Right?

22:44.186 --> 22:45.555
You ain't kiddin'.

22:45.621 --> 22:48.357
No more birthday parties. No more cake.

22:48.458 --> 22:50.092
Well...

22:50.159 --> 22:51.735
Right?

22:51.760 --> 22:55.631
No, my 11th birthday
party, I did... I got cake.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.309
I just didn't get to eat it.

22:58.334 --> 22:59.968
What happened?

23:01.512 --> 23:03.939
- I told you about my mom.
- Uh-huh.

23:04.006 --> 23:06.776
But it can't always be rosy, you know?

23:06.842 --> 23:09.679
Sometimes you have to
try to forget things,

23:09.745 --> 23:11.877
like my cousin Taylor, all right?

23:11.902 --> 23:13.551
The guy's always puttin' me down,

23:13.576 --> 23:14.950
making me feel like shit.

23:15.017 --> 23:17.753
Then he'd play it off, like he
was just teasing or something,

23:17.820 --> 23:19.254
but no, he's an asshole.

23:19.321 --> 23:21.624
There was one time we were
at this fair, all right?

23:21.691 --> 23:26.061
I go into the porta potty, and Taylor
comes and he... he pushes it over...

23:26.128 --> 23:27.497
Time's up.

23:29.999 --> 23:32.169
There it is.

23:32.194 --> 23:34.169
Thank you so much for coming, man.

23:34.236 --> 23:36.839
Yeah. Hey, what's your prison ID number?

23:36.906 --> 23:38.410
What for?

23:38.435 --> 23:41.010
'Cause I wanted to make a
donation to the commissary,

23:41.076 --> 23:42.645
get you some extra thermals.

23:42.712 --> 23:46.018
Marius, you may be the one
pal I got, you know that?

23:46.043 --> 23:47.105
What is it?

23:47.130 --> 23:48.930
Yeah, Pete's prison number is

23:48.955 --> 23:52.709
alpha echo 9-7-5-5.

23:52.734 --> 23:55.122
Tell your Latvians to get on it.

24:06.602 --> 24:07.570
Audrey speaking.

24:07.637 --> 24:08.747
Hey, it's Lance.

24:08.772 --> 24:10.540
I need you to come down to the office.

24:10.573 --> 24:12.501
I got an update for ya.

24:12.526 --> 24:15.545
Uh, good update or a bad update?

24:15.578 --> 24:17.580
It's better if you just come down.

24:20.282 --> 24:21.784
Son of a bitch.

24:23.152 --> 24:24.319
Hey, Grandma.

24:24.386 --> 24:26.269
He called just like you said he would.

24:26.294 --> 24:27.590
What'd he say?

24:27.657 --> 24:30.092
He has news about the
investment, come to his office.

24:30.159 --> 24:32.486
Right, so this is the
part where he tells you

24:32.511 --> 24:34.029
Victoria disappeared,

24:34.096 --> 24:35.264
and you both have been conned.

24:35.330 --> 24:36.668
You headed over there now?

24:36.693 --> 24:38.495
No.

24:38.557 --> 24:39.684
Where are you?

24:39.709 --> 24:41.711
I'm on 58.

24:41.788 --> 24:44.058
I just couldn't...

24:44.083 --> 24:46.108
I don't know if I can do this, Pete.

24:46.175 --> 24:47.926
Well, sure you can.

24:47.951 --> 24:50.181
All the lying and deceit.

24:51.592 --> 24:55.529
Look, I know you're angry
and uh... and scared.

24:55.554 --> 24:59.797
But, you know, use
that. That's not lying.

24:59.882 --> 25:03.787
I... I'm just so... you know...

25:04.458 --> 25:06.793
Now I understand why Julia smokes.

25:06.818 --> 25:08.752
Yeah. Right.

25:09.645 --> 25:10.846
When do we tell her?

25:10.871 --> 25:13.478
Uh, not until we have to.

25:13.511 --> 25:14.612
It's gonna break her heart,

25:14.637 --> 25:17.206
and she's gonna hate me even more.

25:17.272 --> 25:18.377
Yeah.

25:18.402 --> 25:19.712
I gotta go.

25:19.744 --> 25:22.246
Good. Good. And, Grandma,

25:22.271 --> 25:24.054
- the most important thing...
- Yeah.

25:24.079 --> 25:25.681
As much as you might want to,

25:25.748 --> 25:27.049
don't kill him.

25:33.123 --> 25:34.424
I hope this is it.

25:34.990 --> 25:38.141
He also works in town. Bail bonds shop.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.762
Bail bonds?

25:39.829 --> 25:41.764
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

25:44.277 --> 25:46.944
Oh, um, don't ask for Marius Josipovic.

25:46.969 --> 25:49.138
He's going by Pete Murphy.

26:04.654 --> 26:05.755
Hello.

26:09.158 --> 26:10.847
It's some cop.

26:10.872 --> 26:12.561
Sorry, my Dad's in the office.

26:12.662 --> 26:13.863
How can I help you?

26:13.929 --> 26:15.330
I'm lookin' for Pete Murphy.

26:20.344 --> 26:22.746
He's not here.

26:23.227 --> 26:25.662
Any idea where he might be?

26:25.687 --> 26:26.888
Why?

26:26.913 --> 26:28.682
Police business.

26:29.766 --> 26:31.714
Can I see that badge again?

26:34.464 --> 26:35.665
New York.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.187
Can you even do police
work in Bridgeport?

26:38.253 --> 26:40.189
I'm dealing with a local task force.

26:40.214 --> 26:43.125
Oh, wow, my brother's a local
cop. I can just have him call you.

26:43.192 --> 26:45.491
No, that's all right, I
really need to see Pete.

26:45.516 --> 26:48.519
He may have witnessed a crime.

26:48.544 --> 26:50.813
Is he at the bail bond office?

26:50.838 --> 26:52.073
No idea.

26:52.098 --> 26:54.901
But, um, you can give me your card.

26:54.926 --> 26:56.405
I'll have him call you.

26:59.130 --> 27:00.776
Thanks for your time.

27:03.353 --> 27:05.080
Can I tell him what this is about?

27:06.548 --> 27:10.778
Tell him it's about our
mutual friend Marius Josipovic.

27:10.803 --> 27:12.221
Could you write that down?

27:15.118 --> 27:16.455
I'll forget.

27:24.734 --> 27:26.392
You just had a visitor,

27:26.417 --> 27:29.796
some New York detective named Winslow.

27:30.725 --> 27:32.742
- Who did he ask for?
- You.

27:32.775 --> 27:34.463
He came looking for you.

27:34.488 --> 27:35.744
But, yeah, but what did he say?

27:35.745 --> 27:37.747
Did he ask for me by name?

27:37.813 --> 27:39.414
- Pete.
- Yeah, you, Pete.

27:39.439 --> 27:40.382
What other Pete is there?

27:40.449 --> 27:43.465
He said that you may
have witnessed some crime,

27:43.537 --> 27:47.990
but something about him... bad vibe.

27:48.057 --> 27:51.536
And there was this woman in the car.

27:51.561 --> 27:53.462
- A woman?
- Yeah.

27:53.528 --> 27:55.264
And she didn't look like a cop.

27:55.330 --> 27:57.032
I've been around cops. I can tell.

27:57.099 --> 27:59.234
Did he... did he, uh, leave a number,

27:59.259 --> 28:00.593
or... or, uh...

28:00.618 --> 28:03.873
Yeah, he, uh, left me his card.

28:08.410 --> 28:09.779
Fuck.

28:09.845 --> 28:11.881
Fuck.

28:14.316 --> 28:16.018
- Winslow.
- Let me talk to her.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.553
You won't be talkin' to anybody but me.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.090
- How do I know she's okay?
- You can take my word,

28:21.156 --> 28:24.393
because there's only one
lyin' asshole on this call.

28:24.459 --> 28:26.461
Listen. Listen, I want to make a deal.

28:26.528 --> 28:29.298
Call me Monty Fuckin' Hall.

28:29.364 --> 28:32.201
You can have me. I'll even come to you.

28:32.267 --> 28:33.568
But only at Katie's.

28:33.635 --> 28:36.020
If she's safe and her family's safe,

28:36.045 --> 28:38.073
I'll go without a fight.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.446
Who am I speaking with,

28:39.471 --> 28:41.786
because the Marius I
know would run away.

28:41.811 --> 28:44.814
All right. I'll see ya at the house.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.122
Hey, sweet thing.

28:50.147 --> 28:53.317
How much for, uh, that Macallan?

28:54.842 --> 28:57.745
- This one?
- That's the one.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.929
239 plus tax.

29:00.878 --> 29:03.581
Betcha I could get a discount.

29:03.606 --> 29:06.308
- How?
- Negotiate and try me.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.403
You want it or not?

29:10.572 --> 29:14.502
Actually, no, I came
looking for something else.

29:16.344 --> 29:17.913
That cop your friend?

29:17.980 --> 29:21.350
Maybe. I make friends real easy.

29:21.416 --> 29:24.053
Mira, mami. You're not my type.

29:24.119 --> 29:26.128
What's your type?

29:26.728 --> 29:29.564
About nine inches, uncut.

29:29.953 --> 29:31.526
So you're not gettin' that tape.

29:38.455 --> 29:40.256
Hola, señor, como estas?

29:55.178 --> 29:56.818
Hola, papi.

29:58.437 --> 30:01.408
Sí, papi, mira, the chica is...

30:04.197 --> 30:05.666
Okay.

30:05.921 --> 30:08.257
Okay.

30:11.861 --> 30:13.095
If your daddy weren't a drunk,

30:13.162 --> 30:15.464
he wouldn't be such a good client.

30:21.303 --> 30:23.272
So?

30:23.297 --> 30:24.504
So?

30:27.509 --> 30:29.611
Fuck! I miss that part of the job.

30:31.146 --> 30:33.649
I wish Shawn would still let me do it.

30:33.716 --> 30:35.730
So you got it?

30:37.128 --> 30:38.579
God, I love you.

30:41.223 --> 30:43.759
Hey. Hey, look, let's go
somewhere private and look at this.

30:43.826 --> 30:44.994
- Hm?
- Yeah.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.775
Whatcha drinkin'?

31:01.777 --> 31:03.713
I'm waitin' for a friend.

31:08.250 --> 31:11.480
I heard you're lookin' for
a man who paints houses.

31:12.076 --> 31:13.923
Moe has a big mouth.

31:13.989 --> 31:17.536
Everything on Moe is
big. Including his heart.

31:17.561 --> 31:19.594
He wouldn't have reached
out to me otherwise.

31:19.729 --> 31:21.396
Get enough lectures from Audrey,

31:21.463 --> 31:22.497
I don't need one from you.

31:22.564 --> 31:23.933
Fine.

31:24.031 --> 31:27.334
But this is the very
definition of a bad idea.

31:27.369 --> 31:30.348
Well, you wrote the book on
that, didn't you, bad ideas?

31:30.373 --> 31:31.657
Yeah.

31:32.541 --> 31:36.864
Remember why the staff here all
started calling you lieutenant?

31:36.889 --> 31:39.068
What's your point?

31:39.815 --> 31:41.984
It was when I told Moe
in front of everyone

31:42.051 --> 31:44.275
how Otto Bernhardt

31:44.300 --> 31:47.330
became a lieutenant in Vietnam.

31:47.757 --> 31:49.432
I told the real version,

31:49.464 --> 31:51.161
not that bullshit story you like to tell

31:51.186 --> 31:53.896
full of honor and valor.

31:53.963 --> 31:55.717
'Cause you always
leave out the part about

31:55.742 --> 31:58.630
how you caught a drunken
major on a step ladder

31:58.655 --> 32:00.369
trying to fuck a water buffalo.

32:03.511 --> 32:07.981
And this... this matters how?

32:08.006 --> 32:09.475
It doesn't.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.559
- Just gettin' your attention.
- Yeah?

32:13.048 --> 32:15.818
Killing Dockery's not
gonna solve anything.

32:15.885 --> 32:18.553
Say this guy goes the
way of Jimmy Hoffa.

32:18.813 --> 32:21.494
His family is never gonna
stop looking for him.

32:21.519 --> 32:22.740
You know this, Otto.

32:22.765 --> 32:25.895
And then one day, there'll
be a knock at your door,

32:25.961 --> 32:28.063
and maybe you're not home to answer it,

32:28.130 --> 32:33.135
and maybe Audrey or
Carly opens that door.

32:35.004 --> 32:37.771
You ready to roll the dice on that?

32:44.893 --> 32:46.260
Sammy.

32:49.930 --> 32:51.898
This thing...

32:52.354 --> 32:55.057
this thing does not
make it back to Audrey.

32:55.124 --> 32:57.392
- I want your word on that.
- Fuck you.

32:57.459 --> 32:59.384
You keep quiet on this,

32:59.728 --> 33:01.688
and we'll be square.

33:01.713 --> 33:02.728
For what?

33:02.753 --> 33:04.657
For draggin' your ass out of the jungle

33:04.699 --> 33:07.119
to that LZ in the A Shau Valley.

33:07.144 --> 33:09.980
You are one stubborn motherfucker.

33:20.282 --> 33:22.833
You got a big fuckin'
mouth. Make the call.

33:34.742 --> 33:37.244
I come baring gifts.

33:37.269 --> 33:39.138
The holy trinity.

33:39.468 --> 33:43.965
A drink, a lady, and
a whole lot of cash.

33:44.073 --> 33:46.341
Boy, that's a tough decision.

33:47.918 --> 33:49.319
- You know what?
- What?

33:49.344 --> 33:51.046
I want it all.

33:51.113 --> 33:51.881
Yeah?

33:51.947 --> 33:54.349
- In this order.
- Mm-hm.

33:54.416 --> 33:57.094
One.

33:57.386 --> 33:59.788
- Two.
- Mm-hm.

33:59.889 --> 34:01.023
Three.

34:03.926 --> 34:06.728
So, does Winslow have a
location on Marius yet?

34:06.795 --> 34:10.665
Yeah, turns out he was right
about him going up to Bridgeport.

34:10.732 --> 34:12.504
Thinks he's getting closer.

34:13.202 --> 34:14.335
So this I never quite got.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.637
What happens when he finds him?

34:15.704 --> 34:16.938
Winslow keeps an eye on him.

34:17.005 --> 34:19.074
Hopefully, it's his good eye.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.310
Marius tries to run, he gets him.

34:21.376 --> 34:25.580
Marius brings me my
money, I forgive him.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.716
- That's it?
- Yeah.

34:27.782 --> 34:30.568
Well, I mean, uh...

34:30.972 --> 34:34.708
he still owes Winslow
for the eye, but...

34:34.822 --> 34:36.690
they gotta take care of
that shit on their own.

34:36.757 --> 34:39.516
Ever think maybe Winslow lets
his eye get the best of him

34:39.542 --> 34:42.496
before you get the
money, and kills Marius?

34:42.563 --> 34:44.934
Nah. Trust me. I'll get my money.

34:46.850 --> 34:48.076
_

34:48.703 --> 34:51.373
Mr. Mukherjee. How are you?

34:54.976 --> 34:56.145
Ah.

35:00.682 --> 35:05.025
Mm. Um, unfortunately, I can't.

35:05.287 --> 35:08.584
But, uh, I'll see you
when you're back in town.

35:12.627 --> 35:14.385
You're too kind.

35:14.511 --> 35:16.513
Thank you.

35:16.999 --> 35:19.001
- Bye.
- What the hell was that?

35:19.068 --> 35:20.840
He asked me to lunch,

35:20.865 --> 35:23.362
- and he's not coming Sunday.
- Fuck.

35:23.387 --> 35:26.055
- What?
- Yeah, he's flying to India.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.344
Family business.

35:27.369 --> 35:29.176
How the hell am I supposed
to catch him cheating

35:29.201 --> 35:30.979
if he's not even here?

35:30.980 --> 35:33.521
You know, fuck that. He's comin'.

35:33.546 --> 35:34.931
Baby, you can't force him to stay.

35:34.956 --> 35:35.985
Watch me.

35:36.018 --> 35:38.553
Okay, if you do that,
he's gonna get suspicious,

35:38.620 --> 35:40.127
and then he'll never show.

35:41.690 --> 35:43.160
Shit.

35:46.095 --> 35:48.197
Hang on. Call him back.

35:48.263 --> 35:51.466
Tell him, uh, that
your schedule opened up,

35:51.533 --> 35:53.402
and you would love to
have lunch with him.

35:53.468 --> 35:55.504
We're gonna use his crush on you

35:55.570 --> 35:57.565
to get him to stay.

35:58.340 --> 36:00.409
Promise him a good time if you have to.

36:00.475 --> 36:03.663
- Excuse me?
- I didn't say you had to do anything.

36:03.688 --> 36:06.520
You know, just... give him
a little hope, that's all.

36:06.545 --> 36:08.395
- A little tickle.
- Uh-huh.

36:08.420 --> 36:10.209
Lina, come on.

36:12.012 --> 36:14.389
Victoria's gone.

36:14.456 --> 36:17.126
I went to her place,
this was all I found.

36:17.192 --> 36:19.594
The landlord said he's never seen her.

36:20.361 --> 36:24.027
The rent was always paid,
he's just never seen her.

36:24.829 --> 36:26.097
I'm sorry, Audrey.

36:26.130 --> 36:27.669
What are you trying to tell me?

36:27.736 --> 36:29.204
She never lived there.

36:29.271 --> 36:30.372
Her boyfriend on the planning commission

36:30.439 --> 36:32.041
is 60 years old and married.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.543
He's never heard of any Victoria Gemmet.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.563
- And my money?
- There is no money.

36:36.588 --> 36:37.745
We've been conned.

36:37.770 --> 36:40.049
There's no Google
campus, there's nothing.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.152
You... owe me.

36:45.054 --> 36:46.421
My money's gone, too.

36:49.058 --> 36:50.949
We still have the property.

36:50.974 --> 36:52.719
Worthless.

36:53.259 --> 36:57.000
And I overpaid to go
in front of the line.

36:57.025 --> 36:59.027
I know.

36:59.501 --> 37:01.928
- I'm sorry.
- I'm ruined.

37:02.578 --> 37:04.939
Everything. The business.

37:05.488 --> 37:06.689
Gone!

37:06.714 --> 37:08.716
I'm here for you, whatever you need.

37:29.598 --> 37:31.133
See? They're fine.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.709
Happy? Good, let's go.

37:32.734 --> 37:34.403
I did not mean for this to happen.

37:34.469 --> 37:36.405
Oh, sure you didn't. Let's move.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.274
Will you give me a second? Asshole.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.429
Hold on, I need to speak to Marius.

37:41.454 --> 37:43.345
This is not an intervention.

37:43.412 --> 37:45.780
Sweetie, why don't you
go outside and play.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.117
Amanda, I'm so sorry.

37:49.118 --> 37:51.120
I'm a nice guy, Marius.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.355
Problem is, nice gets
taken advantage of,

37:53.422 --> 37:55.844
and that's fine.
I'm... I'm used to that.

37:55.987 --> 37:58.406
- Brendon, can I just...
- Could you shut the fuck up?

37:58.431 --> 38:01.630
What I'm not used to is
having my family put at risk.

38:03.132 --> 38:06.635
- Please.
- My daughter went missing today.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.570
- Because of you.
- Brendon.

38:08.637 --> 38:11.373
Do you have any goddamn idea
what that feels like, huh?

38:11.440 --> 38:13.342
Not knowing where your daughter is? Huh?

38:13.367 --> 38:14.443
Not knowing what happened?

38:14.509 --> 38:17.011
Do you have any idea,
you fuckin' piece of...

38:17.036 --> 38:18.341
Jeez!

38:19.463 --> 38:20.463
You should never have touched my baby.

38:20.488 --> 38:21.656
You should never have touched my baby.

38:27.492 --> 38:29.561
You should never have touched...

38:32.894 --> 38:34.548
Yeah!

38:37.848 --> 38:39.668
You should have never touched my baby.

38:42.437 --> 38:43.938
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.177
Oh, my God, what did you do?

38:48.243 --> 38:49.844
He touched our girl.

38:49.911 --> 38:51.313
He touched our girl.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.291
What are were gonna do when he wakes up?

38:53.316 --> 38:54.949
- We'll fix it, we'll fix it.
- How? How?

38:55.016 --> 38:56.870
How? How? By dismembering him?

38:56.895 --> 38:58.750
Sweetie, I'm so sorry,
I wasn't thinking.

38:58.775 --> 39:02.457
- Yeah, weren't thinking.
- Guys. Guys.

39:02.524 --> 39:04.626
Guys.

39:04.693 --> 39:08.330
I have an idea. I can make this good.

39:16.738 --> 39:18.373
Face the entrance.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.074
- Karolina.
- Hm?

39:20.209 --> 39:23.111
If you don't mind, may I
sit facing the entrance?

39:23.212 --> 39:26.215
I prefer the way the light
radiates off you from that angle.

39:27.351 --> 39:29.575
Charming, as always.

39:29.618 --> 39:32.421
Not so difficult around you.

39:32.487 --> 39:34.289
Well, thank you for joining me.

39:34.356 --> 39:36.891
It is I who should thank
you for inviting me.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.427
Now I can get to know you.

39:38.493 --> 39:40.229
There's not much to know.

39:40.302 --> 39:44.306
So, why the sudden invitation?

39:44.366 --> 39:45.693
I don't know.

39:45.718 --> 39:47.320
Boredom.

39:47.536 --> 39:50.539
I'm not surprised. Vince is a dull man.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.374
Doesn't even play in his own games.

39:52.449 --> 39:54.832
He just hovers like a vulture.

39:54.888 --> 39:57.743
Well, the house doesn't play
against its guests, it's his rule.

39:58.055 --> 40:00.615
I would love for him to change his rule.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.226
I would give anything
to play against him.

40:03.285 --> 40:04.619
You really don't like him.

40:04.686 --> 40:07.389
It is Vince who does not like me.

40:07.655 --> 40:10.892
Perhaps it's my money, or my complexion.

40:10.959 --> 40:13.027
As for myself,

40:13.094 --> 40:15.264
does a lion consider the ant?

40:15.330 --> 40:16.931
He does not.

40:16.998 --> 40:20.502
I simply enjoy annoying him.

40:20.569 --> 40:22.704
Speaking of which, will
you be joining us on Sunday?

40:22.771 --> 40:24.939
I would never miss a chance to see you.

40:26.074 --> 40:29.077
Maybe one day instead of lunch,

40:29.143 --> 40:30.879
we can have dinner.

40:30.937 --> 40:32.673
Followed by breakfast.

40:32.739 --> 40:34.222
Hm.

40:34.247 --> 40:36.901
There's a speed limit in
this state, Mr. Mukherjee.

40:36.951 --> 40:39.187
45 miles an hour.

40:39.254 --> 40:41.290
Isn't that from "Double Indemnity"?

40:41.356 --> 40:43.992
The story where a woman and her lover

40:44.058 --> 40:45.360
kill the husband.

40:47.888 --> 40:49.097
Maybe.

40:49.163 --> 40:51.934
You'll excuse me, I need to
use the little girls room.

40:55.337 --> 40:56.705
Pardon.

41:00.309 --> 41:01.643
Perfect.

41:01.710 --> 41:04.112
So we'll see you here in an hour.

41:04.178 --> 41:05.980
Don't forget your checkbook.

41:06.379 --> 41:07.582
Hey. Good news.

41:07.649 --> 41:11.219
I, uh, got Rhonda Wertz to
bring by her final bond payment.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.987
- Uh.
- Woohoo, right?

41:13.054 --> 41:14.456
Go home. I'll finish the day.

41:14.523 --> 41:15.757
No, I'm here 'til closing.

41:15.824 --> 41:17.692
No need for two of us on a Saturday.

41:17.759 --> 41:19.328
- I'll close.
- No, I'll close.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.075
If I leave now, my
check will be $100 short.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.575
Julia, I'm not looking for an argument.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.027
Funny, 'cause we seem to
be in the middle of one.

41:24.052 --> 41:25.162
So if you don't need us both here,

41:25.187 --> 41:26.401
then I'll stay, and you can go...

41:26.468 --> 41:28.336
Stop it! Jesus.

41:28.337 --> 41:31.899
For once, can't you
just act like an adult.

41:49.791 --> 41:51.893
Looky here. The baby Bernhardt.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.362
Didn't you see the sign, no loitering?

41:54.363 --> 41:57.131
Wow, were you born this grumpy,

41:57.198 --> 41:59.233
or is it the age?

41:59.368 --> 42:01.135
Taylor's off today.

42:01.202 --> 42:02.537
I know, I'm meeting him here.

42:02.604 --> 42:04.038
We're supposed to get something to eat.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.389
All right, have a seat.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.158
And don't bother me.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.187
Hey, um, mister sergeant?

42:15.212 --> 42:18.167
Uh, I was just wondering,
do you, by any chance,

42:18.192 --> 42:22.156
know how they get all
that gas from the rocks

42:22.223 --> 42:23.858
when they do fracking?

42:23.925 --> 42:26.027
I have no fracking idea.

42:26.094 --> 42:28.463
I'm serious. It's for a school paper.

42:28.530 --> 42:30.398
Yahoo your phone.

42:30.399 --> 42:31.766
It's dead.

42:33.802 --> 42:36.971
Could I just use Taylor's computer?

42:37.038 --> 42:38.773
- No.
- Come on.

42:38.840 --> 42:41.910
What am I gonna do,
release all the prisoners?

42:43.103 --> 42:45.413
One minute. That's it.

43:08.032 --> 43:13.048
_

43:39.686 --> 43:43.003
_

44:07.553 --> 44:09.363
What the fuck?

44:09.655 --> 44:10.865
Wait, I...

44:15.242 --> 44:16.705
Why would he do that?

44:16.771 --> 44:18.507
Does this make sense to you?

44:18.540 --> 44:21.903
I think you have to have
words with your cousin.

44:22.110 --> 44:24.178
I have to go. Shawn will be home in 15.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.614
Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.048
I just need a little advice.

44:27.115 --> 44:28.411
I need to go home.

44:30.351 --> 44:32.554
We can talk later. All right?

44:32.621 --> 44:34.913
Where should I drop you?

44:38.334 --> 44:40.552
I don't know. Sometime last night.

44:40.577 --> 44:42.196
Yeah, one minute.

44:42.379 --> 44:44.265
Look, I just want to replace this card.

44:45.360 --> 44:48.093
Do we really have to
do... I said hold on.

44:49.070 --> 44:50.972
Sorry, I lost my wallet.

44:54.333 --> 44:56.077
Buy the boat.

44:56.778 --> 44:59.055
Buy it and we'll take a trip.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.183
A long trip. A week, a
month, I don't care where.

45:02.250 --> 45:03.671
Okay.

45:04.470 --> 45:07.076
- Where's this coming from?
- I'm serious.

45:08.738 --> 45:10.140
Okay.

45:10.421 --> 45:12.756
Won't that distract the kids?

45:13.061 --> 45:15.196
Not if we stop running
around behind their backs.

45:15.484 --> 45:19.100
Or anyone else's back.
We need to live our lives.

45:19.167 --> 45:21.570
- Our lives.
- Yeah, why the hell not?

45:26.246 --> 45:28.209
'Cause you're not listening to me.

45:28.276 --> 45:30.979
Gamboa goes on the Northfield account.

45:31.045 --> 45:34.215
Brooks gets his from
Valley National. Well?

45:34.282 --> 45:35.684
- He's coming.
- Yes!

45:35.750 --> 45:37.385
I gotta go.

45:37.451 --> 45:39.253
Oh, my God.

45:39.312 --> 45:41.923
My God, look at you.

45:41.990 --> 45:43.992
Oh, my God.

45:47.195 --> 45:48.597
That's my girl.

45:54.201 --> 45:56.104
Did you have to entice
him with anything?

45:56.170 --> 45:58.607
Oh, he just wants a threesome.

45:59.052 --> 46:01.342
- What?
- Yeah, so just make sure you shave.

46:01.409 --> 46:03.504
Wait. Are you kidding?

46:03.529 --> 46:05.097
No.

46:05.479 --> 46:07.701
Ahhh. It's not funny.

46:07.726 --> 46:09.517
- It's a little bit funny, right?
- No, it's not.

46:09.618 --> 46:11.252
- Come on.
- Gives me the creeps.

46:23.364 --> 46:24.799
Can I talk to you for a minute?

46:29.638 --> 46:31.105
That, uh...

46:33.018 --> 46:35.620
that detective shouldn't have come here.

46:35.713 --> 46:37.380
Today. I'm sorry about that.

46:37.447 --> 46:41.384
It's fine, there's a shot
gun in the hall closet.

46:43.494 --> 46:45.163
I can take care of myself.

46:45.230 --> 46:47.065
Yeah, you're pretty resourceful.

46:47.132 --> 46:49.567
Well, in this family, it's...

46:49.634 --> 46:50.936
the only way to survive.

46:54.439 --> 46:56.341
Your room is pretty cute.

47:00.170 --> 47:02.313
You remember when you were
asking me about my 11th birthday,

47:02.380 --> 47:05.750
and, uh, you told me that
story about our drunk moms,

47:05.751 --> 47:07.452
and the cake falling on the floor?

47:07.518 --> 47:09.024
Yeah.

47:09.049 --> 47:10.985
That didn't happen.

47:11.422 --> 47:14.192
Yeah, I don't know if
you got that from Audrey,

47:14.259 --> 47:17.428
um, and I... you know, I went
along with it because, uh...

47:20.165 --> 47:23.191
well, because the real story sucks.

47:23.969 --> 47:27.806
Maybe Audrey was trying
to keep it from you, but...

47:29.896 --> 47:31.132
I won't.

47:34.238 --> 47:35.906
Truth is,

47:36.314 --> 47:39.184
my mom never showed
up to my 11th birthday.

47:41.439 --> 47:42.587
Well, that's... that's not true.

47:42.653 --> 47:44.264
She was there in the morning,

47:44.289 --> 47:47.058
and hen she went out to get ice cream.

47:47.271 --> 47:49.542
Uh, she just never came back.

47:51.437 --> 47:54.050
And I wanted to wait, uh,

47:54.685 --> 47:56.199
but we started without her,

47:56.234 --> 47:58.636
then when the cake came out
and she still wasn't there,

47:58.703 --> 48:00.605
I threw a fit.

48:00.671 --> 48:02.908
So Audrey cancelled it.

48:04.705 --> 48:07.624
Grandma cancelled my 11th birthday.

48:10.950 --> 48:13.986
But your mom...

48:14.054 --> 48:15.255
God bless her,

48:15.280 --> 48:19.657
Aunt Lila went out looking for my mom.

48:19.724 --> 48:21.259
She found her in some bar,

48:21.326 --> 48:26.364
uh, drunk, you know,
mixing with riffraff.

48:26.759 --> 48:30.005
It was just pathetic, so
she just left her there.

48:31.202 --> 48:32.670
And then, you know what she did?

48:32.737 --> 48:33.839
What?

48:33.905 --> 48:37.542
She showed up with a brand new Sega 7.

48:37.608 --> 48:39.136
You know what that is?

48:39.176 --> 48:40.511
No, what's that?

48:40.578 --> 48:43.882
It's only the best goddamn
video game console ever created.

48:45.682 --> 48:48.351
And she played with me for hours.

48:48.386 --> 48:50.856
She played with me until I forgot.

48:56.427 --> 48:58.062
She lost every game.

49:05.995 --> 49:09.607
You know, our moms talked less and less

49:09.674 --> 49:11.476
as the years went on.

49:11.542 --> 49:15.780
But, um, there was one
night I'll never forget.

49:15.881 --> 49:20.018
Your mom called my mom
the night you were born.

49:26.424 --> 49:28.026
And they talked for a little while,

49:28.093 --> 49:31.562
and then, uh, when my mom hung up,

49:31.629 --> 49:33.803
she was... she was so happy.

49:35.233 --> 49:37.518
She dug out this, uh...

49:37.543 --> 49:39.728
this cupcake.

49:39.770 --> 49:41.486
It must have been a week old,

49:41.526 --> 49:44.409
and, uh, she... she looked for a candle,

49:44.475 --> 49:46.577
she couldn't find one,
so she got a match,

49:46.644 --> 49:48.447
and she stuck it in.

49:48.556 --> 49:49.957
Lit it.

49:51.750 --> 49:53.479
And we celebrated.

49:57.422 --> 50:00.125
My mom wasn't there to have
cake with me on my birthday,

50:00.191 --> 50:03.488
but she was there to have
cake with me on yours.

50:49.341 --> 50:50.608
You're the bail guy, right?

50:50.675 --> 50:51.864
Yeah.

50:53.070 --> 50:55.212
Do you need some work done?

50:56.126 --> 50:57.261
Mm.

50:59.517 --> 51:01.987
Just so we know, I
don't do law enforcement.

51:02.099 --> 51:05.056
- Law's not my problem.
- That's good.

51:05.123 --> 51:09.726
Then all I need to know
is who you want gone.

51:11.873 --> 51:13.364
You're lookin' at him.
