Good morning.
Name?

00:05.873 --> 00:08.340
Ha! Not until
I see my lawyer.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.476
And by the way,
I was with them last night.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.644
Max, it's just
for the spring semester.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.347
Sorry, she watches
a lot of <i>lockup: Raw.</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.983
Uh, actually, I'm here
to return checks.

00:17.985 --> 00:19.351
There is no spring semester.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.787
The pastry school
has been closed.

00:23.056 --> 00:24.289
What?

00:24.291 --> 00:26.392
Feel free to collect
any personal items

00:26.394 --> 00:28.227
You may have left
in the workspace.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.897
You get the weed,
I'll get the other weed.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.298
This is insane.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.401
How can school
be suddenly closed?

00:35.403 --> 00:38.003
Oh, good, john's here.
He'll know what happened.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.471
What makes you think he knows?

00:39.473 --> 00:42.408
He's a big queen, max.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.309
He'll know why school's
closed,

00:44.311 --> 00:47.312
And why lady gaga's
last album failed.

With his wife.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.566
Why is he in France?

01:07.568 --> 01:10.235
Hmm, turns out someone
in this room,

01:10.237 --> 01:11.870
Maybe someone I'm looking at
right over there,

01:11.872 --> 01:14.940
Had an affair with him and
his wife found out all about it.

01:17.277 --> 01:20.245

01:20.247 --> 01:24.783
Shocking! I didn't even know
chef nicolas was gay!

Oh, please.

Okay, yes, yes, fine.
It was me.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.900
And my parents say
I'm loose as a goose.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.869
But it was not an affair.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.871
We made out once,
in six different places,

01:45.873 --> 01:49.608
On eight different occasions,
and then I ended it.

It's over!

Thanks, caroline!

a pastry school down.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.736
Can't you just
go to deke's without me?

02:17.738 --> 02:19.438

Then what better place
to be than in a dumpster?

02:22.276 --> 02:24.576
And deke said to make sure
to bring you.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.845
And relax, it's not
a three-way situation.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.413
When we made
our three-way list,

02:28.415 --> 02:31.583
You were at the bottom
with taylor swift.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.753
Well,
at least I'm with taylor.

I'm warning you right now,

02:53.307 --> 02:55.474
I am not in
a partying mood.
[chuckles]

02:55.476 --> 02:57.109
Ain't no party like
a caroline party,

02:57.111 --> 03:00.312
'cause a caroline party
don't start.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.513
I'm heavy with guilt,

03:01.515 --> 03:04.183
And that cheese omelet
we just split.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.451
We're not partying,
but I did snatch back

03:06.453 --> 03:08.720
The weed,
'cause I's perfect.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.622
Good.
I got it from earl

03:10.624 --> 03:12.157
And he says it knocks
you out so hard,

03:12.159 --> 03:13.625
He once used it
and faked death

03:13.627 --> 03:15.627
To cash in
a life insurance policy.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.862
Well, we might need
to do that too

03:16.864 --> 03:18.564
After what I did.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.566
Deke, I am so sorry
about all of this.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.900

03:33.914 --> 03:37.416
Okay, so we all loved
the pastry school, right?

03:37.418 --> 03:40.152
Eh, it was all right.
No big deal.

03:40.154 --> 03:42.387
No big deal?
We had sex in like

03:42.389 --> 03:44.590
Every classroom
and both stairwells.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.694
And on caroline's desk,
but, eh, no big deal.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.562
"eh," kind of a big deal.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.398
Was it a Tuesday, on top of
<i>the new york times?</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:55.601
And did you eat
my cranberry clif bar after?

03:55.603 --> 03:59.104
'cause I made someone cry
about that.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.540
Okay, yes, it was fun.

But it's over,
and that's life.

that frickin' place!

04:25.064 --> 04:27.733
Deke, what are
you talking about?

04:27.735 --> 04:30.102
I'll ask my parents
to buy it as an investment.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.470
Caroline, you can run
the school.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.238
You're already killing it
in the office.

the cannoli again, bitch?

04:40.247 --> 04:43.649
I own the damn place!"

04:43.651 --> 04:45.117
Wait, is this even possible?

04:45.119 --> 04:46.718
I mean, it'll cost millions.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.587
Who cares?
He's rich!

04:48.589 --> 04:50.489
Now I get the whole idea
of money.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.057
It's lovely!

04:52.059 --> 04:53.759
It's the greatest idea ever!

04:53.761 --> 04:55.594
I know!

04:55.596 --> 04:57.396
And since we're doing it
together, you'll both

04:57.398 --> 04:59.131
Have to come meet my parents.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.632
Max, they've been asking
to meet my girlfriend anyway.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.567
Meet your parents?

05:02.569 --> 05:05.404
Eh, the pastry school
wasn't all that.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.747

in your apartment?

05:15.749 --> 05:19.151
Nope, don't belong here.
Hold the doors, bub!

05:19.153 --> 05:22.621
We're okay.
Thank you, james.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.022
Max, just do the opposite

05:24.024 --> 05:26.158
Of everything
you would normally do.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.894
I already am.
I'm here!

05:31.297 --> 05:32.664

05:32.666 --> 05:35.634
Go, be warm.

I'm the housekeeper.

05:43.309 --> 05:46.378
This is iris.
Been with us for years.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.979
Well,
it was a lovely hug.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.648
I'll tell your parents
that you've arrived.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.284
(deke)

so, what, max?

05:52.286 --> 05:55.253
You think any black woman you
see here could be my mother?

05:57.557 --> 06:01.793
Well, any white man I see
anywhere could be my father.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.495
Let's go.
I already screwed up.

06:03.497 --> 06:07.065
No, you heard iris.
It was a lovely hug.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.900
But then again,
she is being paid.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.635
Here, better wear my pearls.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.204
Yeah, right!

06:12.206 --> 06:14.906
Me in those pearls is like
a monkey in baby clothes--

06:14.908 --> 06:16.375
Just plain wrong.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.909
Relax, max.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.178
What, are you crazy,
touching me?

06:20.180 --> 06:22.013
Your mother comes in here
right now, and she's like,

06:22.015 --> 06:27.185
"oh, there she is, the hooker
from the projects...

06:27.187 --> 06:29.354

in the--"

06:29.356 --> 06:32.424
What, fancy-ass book room?

06:35.027 --> 06:37.396
Deke, you have
a warhol soup can?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.431
Uh, yeah, it used to be
in my bedroom.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.333
It got moved out here
after I scotch-taped

06:41.335 --> 06:43.568
A <i>star wars</i> poster over it.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.003
Okay, okay.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.739
See, now, here is something
we have in common.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.042
I used to drink that soup.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.711
I can talk about that.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.780
Perfect, yeah.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.848
Talk about that.
Yeah.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.785
Okay, see, when my mother
was on a bender,

06:59.787 --> 07:02.220
I would bust open the can
on the kitchen counter

07:02.222 --> 07:04.723
'cause I could never find
the opener 'cause she'd use

07:04.725 --> 07:08.326
The sharp tip of it
to clean out her hash pipe.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.063
Give her the damn pearls.
Give me the damn pearls.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.365
It's just a little help--

07:13.367 --> 07:14.699
A signal to the rich people

07:14.701 --> 07:16.568
That says, "I'm one of you."

07:16.570 --> 07:18.637
Like seeing another hells angel
wearing a vest

07:18.639 --> 07:22.240
With a patch that says,
"suck it, pig."

07:22.242 --> 07:24.242
Well, deke better give me
a signal

07:24.244 --> 07:25.710
When his actual mom comes in,

07:25.712 --> 07:29.815
Because the way I'm going,
I'd hug oprah.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.350
Oprah doesn't like
to be hugged.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.954
A mistake I made
at her legends ball.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.323
One hug and 20 minutes later,

07:38.325 --> 07:42.994
My place setting was moved
next to la toya jackson.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.399
Oh.
Mm.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.603
Thanks, girl.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.939
You're max.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.074
I'm deke's mother, genet.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.276
Uh, mom, this is our friend,
caroline.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.778
Thank you for inviting us.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.446
Amazing art collection.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.014
Oh, thank you.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.218
I'm afraid my husband and I
are pop art junkies.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.489
I eat soup.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.365
Speaking of my husband...

08:20.367 --> 08:23.435
David!
"I eat soup"?

08:24.871 --> 08:26.271
He was right behind me.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.806
Oh, sometimes I swear,

08:27.808 --> 08:29.941
I should just leave
a trail of bread crumbs.

08:29.943 --> 08:33.712
[laughs loudly]
that's funny.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.615
Okay, hold on
a second there, folks.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.284
I'm just sending
some business emails.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.819
Actually, I'm not.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.687
[laughing]
I'm looking at celebrities

08:42.689 --> 08:46.858
Without their makeup,
and I gotta say,

08:46.860 --> 08:50.228
Hugh jackman?
Better without makeup.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.731
Mwah!

08:52.733 --> 08:53.865
I'll take that.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.967
All right.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.068
And what's in your mouth?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.804
Sour ball.
Give it to me, please.

08:59.806 --> 09:03.575
Genet, I'm a grown man.
I can have a sour ball.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.177
You asked me to help you
stop eating candy.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.013
It's just one sour ball.
Spit it out.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.314
I can't.
Why not?

09:09.316 --> 09:13.018
It's a mini 3 musketeers.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.986
There he is!

09:14.988 --> 09:16.755
There's my son,

09:16.757 --> 09:18.890
Until we get the results
of the paternity test back.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.991
I love him!

09:19.993 --> 09:21.927
Ugh, hey, come on.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.862
No tongue in front
of my girlfriend.

09:23.864 --> 09:24.930
Max, come over here.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.567
Fine, but no tongue
till after dessert.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.001
[laughs]

09:30.003 --> 09:31.836
"no tongue till
after dessert!"

09:31.838 --> 09:34.005
She's pretty and funny.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.674
Who's your bodyguard?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.209
Oh, um--[chuckles]

09:38.211 --> 09:39.611
This is my friend...

09:39.613 --> 09:42.914
Mm, help me out.
Totally blanked.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.050
[chuckles]
oh, she's a little nervous.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.952
Hello, mr. Bromberg.
I'm caroline.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.954
Drink before dinner, yes?

09:48.956 --> 09:50.455
Yes, but just one.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.857
But not because I'm pregnant!
What?

09:56.128 --> 09:57.896
Sit, let's talk.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.031
Yes, let's sit down,

10:00.033 --> 10:04.970
Have a nice conversation,
get to know each other better.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.571
So, tell me about
pastry school.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.374
Yes, tell us about
pastry school.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.810
Well, we went to class
the other day and it was closed,

10:11.812 --> 10:15.080
And john, this big, gay
pastry chef, was freaking out.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.147
Max does a great impression
of him.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.049
No.
No, I don't.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.719
Yes, max, it's really funny
and totally charming.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.886
Oh, uh, okay.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.822
Uh, he's like 6'5"--

10:23.824 --> 10:24.823
Stand.
You gotta stand.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.791
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.894
And he had his arms up
in the air like this...

10:39.939 --> 10:43.408
Um, I think
his arms were down.

10:43.410 --> 10:48.013
No, they were totally
over his head.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.615
Yeah, she's right,
they were down.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.819
Way down,
like a crocodile.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.489
Or ceelo.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.925
What are you talking about?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.028
They were way up here.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.430
Way over his head, and--

11:05.432 --> 11:07.999
Oh, yea--they were down.

11:08.001 --> 11:08.967
Whoo!
You know what?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.802
I think he was sitting--
[laughs]

11:10.804 --> 11:13.838
And was really quiet.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.007
Excuse me, I have to use
the powder room.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.243
Max, would you come with me?
Try and stop me.

11:21.814 --> 11:22.847
[pressing button]

11:22.849 --> 11:24.983
Max, it's over here.

11:24.985 --> 11:28.453
We're not making
a break for it?

11:28.455 --> 11:31.022
Trapped.
Trapped like rats.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.993
What is wrong with you?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.828
Why are you sweating
so much?

11:36.830 --> 11:39.397
I think we'd be better off
just wetting the whole dress.

11:40.966 --> 11:43.668
I know.
It must be the pearls.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.472
My white trash body is working
overtime to reject them.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.375
Ooh, okay.
Raise your arms.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.977
Why bother?
They already hate me.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.212
Max, they do not hate you.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.547
Well, they will.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.849
This is tommy dolan
all over again.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.084
Who's tommy dolan?

11:59.086 --> 12:03.688
And fyi,
great upper arm workout.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.757
He's this rich kid
I liked in eighth grade.

12:05.759 --> 12:09.928
And by rich, I mean his family
could afford the acne medicine.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.164
He asked me out, but his parents
said no because I was poor.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.366
And, to be clear, that was
before I shot the ten bbs

12:15.368 --> 12:17.335
Into their front
picture window.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.504
Max,
you're not in eighth grade.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.573
This is
a grown-up relationship.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.508
Tonight's not just about
a pastry school,

12:23.510 --> 12:25.543
It's about you and deke,
so get it together.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.580
You have a lot on the line,
and I have a neck cramp.

12:30.449 --> 12:31.950
[knock at door]

12:31.952 --> 12:33.952
<i>Ladies, it's genet.</i>

12:33.954 --> 12:36.621
Trapped.
Trapped like more rats.

12:42.027 --> 12:43.361
Is everything all right
in here?

12:43.363 --> 12:44.896
I didn't take anything.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.765
I--

12:46.767 --> 12:50.268
Caroline, do you mind
if I speak to max, alone?

12:52.104 --> 12:53.404
Our neighbors
have just stopped by.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.740
They've opened
a bottle of champagne.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.109
It's french, wonderful.
Enjoy.

13:00.079 --> 13:03.314
Girl, you need to chill.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.585
Um...Uh, excuse me?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.988
[chuckles]
you have got us all wrong.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.824
You walk in here,
see this fabulous apartment

13:12.826 --> 13:16.161
And all of this "fabulosity,"
and you think--

13:16.163 --> 13:18.963
You think I'm some rich bitch.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.003
I am.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.739
But I wasn't born that way.
Uh-uh.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.941
I am from queens, new york.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.511
Yeah, that's right,
I'm just genet from the block.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.849
Wait, then how did you get

13:37.851 --> 13:40.318
Your own elevator
and fish wallpaper?

13:40.320 --> 13:44.189
Well, when david met me,
I was a dancer.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.491
Oh, you mean like
on broadway?

13:46.493 --> 13:49.327
Yeah,
well, close to broadway.

13:51.630 --> 13:56.167
The point is that we fell
in love so completely

13:56.169 --> 14:00.438
That I even stopped taking
his money after the third visit.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.011
Tell us, deke,

14:07.013 --> 14:11.149
Why a pastry school
of all things?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.383
Who cares?
We're just thrilled

14:12.385 --> 14:15.186
He's no longer
in the circus.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.187
Girls--

14:16.189 --> 14:18.122
I didn't take anything.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.191
Ha.
Amy and adam

14:20.193 --> 14:23.027
Have lived in the building
since deke was little.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.196
Mom,
don't tell max I'm little.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.564
I've convinced her I've got

14:26.566 --> 14:28.299
The biggest one
she'll ever have.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.002
Oh, deke!
[laughs]

14:31.004 --> 14:33.171
Naughty, dirty, funny.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.672
Andy and I love naughty comedy.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.175
We watch bill maher.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.409
This pastry school would be

14:38.411 --> 14:40.078
A huge financial commitment,
david.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.246
Why don't you just go down
to union square

14:41.248 --> 14:43.481
And light a bag of money
on fire?

14:43.483 --> 14:46.584
Mr. Chase, I agree,
it's a huge undertaking.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.253
And if you'd like,
we can discuss a business plan.

14:48.255 --> 14:51.055
I did graduate top of my class
from wharton.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.325
Wharton.
In philadelphia.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.095
The city of brotherly love.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.965
And let me tell you,
it certainly is.

15:03.202 --> 15:05.270
Our son, hunter,
went to wharton.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.938
He's about your age.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.940
I'll text and tell him
we've met you.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.942
What is your last name,
caroline?

15:10.944 --> 15:15.947
Um...

15:15.949 --> 15:18.683
[low]
channing.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.184
Caroline channing?

15:20.186 --> 15:21.719
Your father isn't
martin channing,

15:21.721 --> 15:23.788
The one in prison
for the ponzi scheme?

15:23.790 --> 15:27.558
Amazing fish!
I-I love this tilapia.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.728
It's almost a chicken-y fish.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.196
Deke, you never told us
about this.

15:32.198 --> 15:36.367
What, that the fish
was chicken-y?

15:36.369 --> 15:38.970
You know that's why
I don't come home anymore.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.306
Why would I tell you?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.041
She didn't steal the money,
he did.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.709
Deke does have a point.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.979
It wasn't caroline,
and her father is serving time.

15:47.981 --> 15:51.582
Ah, speaking of serving,
there are like nine forks here.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.252
Where do I go next?

15:54.254 --> 15:57.055
It's easy for you to say, deke.
You didn't lose money.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.124
Amy and I had to move from the
penthouse to the fourth floor.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.793
The fourth floor, deke!

16:01.795 --> 16:04.996
That's three above
the doorman.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.065
Only five bedrooms, and I can
hear the "whoosh-whoosh"

16:07.067 --> 16:08.066
Of the damn elevator
all night long!

16:08.068 --> 16:10.835
Oh.
Shh, shh.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.270
Genet, I cannot believe
you would invite

16:12.272 --> 16:14.138
A channing into your home.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.843
Sir, if you say another
bad word about her,

16:18.845 --> 16:21.245
I'm gonna "whoosh-whoosh"
you off that chair.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.515
Max, these are our friends.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.850
Yeah, well she is my friend,

16:25.852 --> 16:27.418
And she's had it pretty rough.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.520
And I'm not gonna sit here
and let them insult her.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.557
[mocking]
oh, you only have
five bedrooms?

16:33.659 --> 16:36.227
Well, she sleeps in the wall.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.136
You rich people
are all the same.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.471
Max, take it down.

16:46.473 --> 16:49.440
You're gonna "whoosh"
you did later.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.476
No, deke.
I mean, look at this table.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.379
Seven forks and ten knives,
for what?

16:54.381 --> 16:56.314
You know what we have
at our apartment?

16:56.316 --> 17:00.952
Five chopsticks and a spork
from kentucky fried chicken,

17:00.954 --> 17:03.254
And we do fine.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.558
We don't need to sit here
and gravel--

17:07.560 --> 17:10.862
Grovel.
Whatever...

17:10.864 --> 17:12.730
For your money
or their approval.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.233
All I can say is,
you rich people are lucky

17:15.235 --> 17:17.869
Those cops took my bb gun.
Let's go, caroline.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.570
No, this is my fault.
I'll go.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.073
No, you know what?
We'll all go.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.342
Deacon, sit down.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.377
You are not leaving
the table with them.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.678
I go where she goes.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.913
Except not in the bathroom,

17:28.915 --> 17:30.648
Because we like to leave
a little mystery.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.653
I mean, what is
the big deal, anyway?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.855
You have a problem with her
because of her father,

17:37.857 --> 17:41.759
But no problem with his mom
being a stripper?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.694
What?
You were a stripper?

17:43.696 --> 17:46.431
Mom?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.499
Max!

17:48.501 --> 17:50.835
Oh, is that not
common knowledge?

17:54.406 --> 17:56.207
I feel so bad.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.442
Don't.
I should have guessed.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.911
My mom's way too limber
at tennis.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.547
And it totally makes me
respect my dad more.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.916
A jew marrying
a black woman is impressive.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.518
Marrying a black stripper
is awesome.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.387
No, I feel bad about
your parents

18:09.389 --> 18:11.355
Cutting you off financially.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.459
But you're okay
with outing my mom?

18:14.461 --> 18:17.195
Look, they gave me a choice,
my money or you.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.964
It only took me two hours
to decide, and I picked you.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.933
I wish it took you two hours.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.301
You didn't even think it over.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.403
You were out of there
immediately.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.972
Deke, how are you gonna live
without money?

18:27.974 --> 18:29.540
Hey, I already live
in a dumpster.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.808
I'm used to roughing it.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.310
Who bought the dumpster?

18:32.312 --> 18:33.377
They did.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.446
Who bought the solar panels
on the roof?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.747
They did.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.382
But I bought that cool
skateboard poster.

18:38.384 --> 18:39.417
Deke--

18:39.419 --> 18:40.585
Okay, it was in
a box of honeycomb.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.386
And who bought the honeycomb?

18:42.388 --> 18:45.056
They did.
Max, it'll be fun.

18:45.058 --> 18:48.126
Oh, come on.
How hard could it be?

18:48.128 --> 18:50.328
Look, I get up tomorrow,
I get a job here,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.797
Zippity-boo,
get another job there.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.500
Now I got 20,000,
then zippity-pow,

18:55.502 --> 18:57.735
Make another 20,000,
zippity-zang.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.271
Then I'm lousy
with honeycomb.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.007
Now, cheechity-chong,
where did I put earl's weed?

19:09.748 --> 19:11.582
What's the emergency?
Are you all right?

19:11.584 --> 19:14.452
I'm fine, but deke's insane!

19:14.454 --> 19:17.522
He thinks he can make it
as a poor person.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.290
You never know, I did.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.859
Sure, the first--
what's today, Monday?

19:21.861 --> 19:24.362
Sure, the first thousand days
were hard, but--

19:24.364 --> 19:26.297
Deke is nothing like you!

19:26.299 --> 19:29.834
You are resilient and smart
and creative and driven.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.336
No one could do what you did.
You're amazing.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.939
Max, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.507
Oh, don't get all wet.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.977
You're still at the bottom
of the three-way list.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.514
My point is, I can't let deke
give up his money.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.316
It's his decision.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.552
And it's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.054
It's crap!

19:50.056 --> 19:53.558
I care about deke more than
I have ever cared about anyone,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.359
So I have to give him back.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.694
I just called his mother.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.697
At 2:00 a.M.,
and she picked up the phone?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.499
Oh, right, I forgot.
She was a stripper.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.635
She's used to picking things up
at night.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.337
And she said
they'd take deke back,

20:06.339 --> 20:08.206
But he has to come to them.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.473
That's great.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.808
So, come on.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.077
You and I are pushing
him home...

20:13.079 --> 20:15.213
In the dumpster.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.582
Pushing it to
the upper east side?

20:17.584 --> 20:18.916
Yes!

20:18.918 --> 20:20.151
He's totally knocked out
on earl's weed.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.552
He will not feel a thing.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.887
Come on, help me push
right now

20:22.889 --> 20:24.555
Before
I realize what I'm losing

20:24.557 --> 20:26.591
And change my mind.
Go!

20:26.593 --> 20:28.226
You take that side,
I'll take this,

20:28.228 --> 20:29.727
And we won't stop till
we're there

20:29.729 --> 20:31.829
Or one of us falls off
the brooklyn bridge.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.931
We can never get it there, max.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.433
Then we'll get it
as far as we can,

20:35.435 --> 20:37.168
And then at least
when deke wakes up

20:37.170 --> 20:39.537
He won't be stuck here with me
in the morning,

20:39.539 --> 20:42.006
And he can have a life.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.608
I was wrong earlier.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.811
This is the most romantic thing
I've ever seen.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.014
Yeah, don't cut yourself
on the dumpster

20:50.016 --> 20:52.450
Or you'll get lockjaw.
Push.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.685
[grunts]
oh, max.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.355
Even better upper arm
workout!

20:57.357 --> 21:00.858
See,
only you would say that.

21:00.860 --> 21:05.763
[distant siren wailing]
[dog barking]

21:07.366 --> 21:09.433
[cash register bell dings]
