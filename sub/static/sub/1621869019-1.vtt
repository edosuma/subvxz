- Are you going to be fired?

14:39.921 --> 14:41.357
No, I'm not going to be fired. Okay?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.748
No, it's not like that.
I... I don't think so.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.175
I'll go back as soon as they sort it out.
Can I please have my phone?

14:54.352 --> 14:55.933
Wait, Billy. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:57.438 --> 15:00.430
Wow. What is this place?

15:00.525 --> 15:02.265
So cool.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.893
Wait, Billy, look. Look at the milky way.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.488
Oh, my god. It's so cool.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.237
You see this? Oh.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.364
- Hey, baby?
- What?

15:14.455 --> 15:16.286
- You're the starlight queen.
- Hmm.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.877
Oh, thank you.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.180
That was so cool.
Hey, come dance!

15:34.267 --> 15:37.009
Come on. Come and dance.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.343
No? Okay.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.058
Let's go. Come on.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.020
Seven, eight, nine. And now clap it out.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.901
One, two, three.
More pushups, let's go.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.199
- Five, six, seven.
- Oh, geez, dad.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.776
Come on, come on.
Hey, seven, seven.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.328
- Slow. Come on.
- Okay.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.685
- Hey, come on. One more set.
- We've been going for like 10 minutes.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.791
- Jesus.
- All right.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.709
All right, let's go. Okay,
you get a break.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.274
- You get 30 seconds. Let's go.
- Dad...

16:05.298 --> 16:06.333
Huh?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.085
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.196
- You and mom got in a fight again.
- Twenty-five... no, no, we're fine.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.007
Everything's good. We...
We're fine.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.635
I promise. How's your, uh, relationship?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.466
How's your, uh...

16:20.021 --> 16:21.136
- Sam?
- How's Sam?

16:22.773 --> 16:26.436
You don't have to ask.
I know you don't... want to.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.811
No. I do. I do.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.396
I want to know. How...

16:31.491 --> 16:32.697
How is he?

16:34.619 --> 16:35.904
Fine?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.111
He's not distracting you, is he?

16:38.206 --> 16:41.039
- No, he's not distracting me.
- All right.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.117
It's just, you know, it's...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.168
Something that your coach said.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.944
- What?
- He was just checking if you were okay.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.550
I mean, what with all
the doctor's appointments

16:53.638 --> 16:55.674
that you've been going
to over the last few weeks.

16:55.765 --> 16:59.553
The ones that conveniently
fall between the hours of 6 and 8 P.M.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.351
Right in the middle of practice?

17:02.438 --> 17:05.601
I mean, from where I'm standing,
this thing is distracting you.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.773
- No. Sam is not a thing.
- You know what I'm saying.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.694
Yes, I do know what you're saying.
You wish that Sam was my girlfriend.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.692
- But he's not. He's my boy...
- That's not...

17:13.782 --> 17:15.272
Hey!

17:15.367 --> 17:17.358
- What?
- I don't know. I don't know. But...

17:18.663 --> 17:19.782
- What is it?
- I don't know.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.353
- What the hell happened?
- It was a hyena.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.521
He just walked right up here.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.105
- Ran right up here.
- Well, is... is everyone okay?

17:27.128 --> 17:28.440
- Everyone's fine.
- You okay? You okay?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.250
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It came...

17:30.341 --> 17:31.706
It came creeping out of the trees.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.512
Oh, wow. Yeah, look at him.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.880
- He's right there.
- Yeah, he's right there. You see him?

17:44.105 --> 17:46.096
Did you see that mangy-looking
dog-like thing?

17:46.190 --> 17:48.101
Oh, I thought he was pretty handsome.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.650
He was just looking for food.
No harm, everyone.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.443
- Hey, are you okay?
- It's a hyena, Noah.

17:53.531 --> 17:57.649
My god. But they're...
They're kind of dangerous, right?

17:57.743 --> 18:01.156
Well, they're scavengers, bro.
Nature's trash cans, right?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.956
That's true, Billy.
But one alone is just harmless.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.876
But if they're in a group, they're
very dangerous. They can even kill a lion.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.491
- Okay.
- When found alone,

18:11.549 --> 18:12.834
this can do the magic.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.711
It's all you need, really.

18:14.802 --> 18:15.802
That's okay.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.343
- Just go back to having fun.
- You know, uh,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.013
no hyenas in bora bora.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.768
Come on.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.441
Oh, thank you.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.200
- Jack, can you put that away?
- Hmm? Yeah, yeah.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.715
- Good morning.
- Morning, honey.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.095
Morning, sweetheart.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.183
- So cool, Jack.
- What?

19:10.274 --> 19:12.514
Oh, honey, come here. Let me get that.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.110
Mom. Why so early?

19:17.198 --> 19:20.440
Adventure begins early, honey.
Have some coffee, you'll wake up.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.525
Isn't there any adventure after 10 A.M.?

19:22.620 --> 19:25.032
- Who's ready for the big five?
- What's the big five?

19:25.122 --> 19:28.410
Ah, lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard and...

19:28.501 --> 19:29.866
Shit.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.996
- Rhino.
- Rhino.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.750
Oh, I hope we see a rhino.
Jack, do you think we'll see a rhino?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.000
- Thank you.
- We will.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.504
We will see a rhino. I promise.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.461
Whoo. Big promise.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.784
- We just have to find them.
- What the brochure said to us.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.720
- Obviously, that wouldn't lie.
- Never.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.637
Oh. Oh, my goodness. Okay.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.392
- What do you feel, Jack?
- I feel like...

19:52.483 --> 19:55.145
- I feel like we're in Africa.
- Yeah, well.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.976
Get ready for our day.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.424
- Good morning, halsey family.
- Good morning. Good morning.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.218
And what do you have planned
for this glorious day?

20:01.242 --> 20:02.948
A safari!

20:03.035 --> 20:06.243
- Oh. Um...
- Is something wrong?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.867
No, not at all. Could I please have
a word with you?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.289
Yeah, of course, of course.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.748
See, Mr. Halsey,

20:14.839 --> 20:17.706
the safari is not part
of your particular package.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.963
If you recall, when you booked,
you canceled all the extras.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.295
- Yes, yes, that's right. I did, didn't 1?
- Of course.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.551
But if you'd like to pay
for the extras now...

20:26.642 --> 20:28.849
And how much would that be?

20:30.104 --> 20:33.016
Great news.
We get to do our own safari today.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.434
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.357
Our friend Lucas back there,
he just told me

20:37.445 --> 20:39.686
if we want the best experience possible,

20:39.780 --> 20:41.941
we gotta go into the park on our own.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.281
That... doesn't sound...

20:44.368 --> 20:45.904
- Right.
- It is. It is.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.635
- Don't we need a guard?
- Yeah, and guns.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.743
No, no, no, all that stuff
is just fluff. It's extra.

20:49.790 --> 20:53.578
It's just one big safari park in there.
Besides, we have our van and our map.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.500
And we get to do it together.
It'll be fun.

20:55.588 --> 20:59.001
Our big five finds their big five, right?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.082
Yeah.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.177
Prrrr. Right. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.766
- Bye. Have fun.
- Bye-bye. Have a good one.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.693
- We have to try. Let's see.
- One, two, three.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.473
- Oh, that's great, guys.
- Cool.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.273
This is gonna work out just fine.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.648
Plastic water bottles, Jack?
They have glass ones here.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.650
Here they actually care
about the environment.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.483
Yeah, you know, the main product
of the water bottle industry

21:26.577 --> 21:28.408
is plastic, not water, Jack.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.282
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Did you know that?

21:30.372 --> 21:31.953
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.407
- Did you know that, honey?
- It's true, honey.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.208
Too much plastic in the world.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.876
Okay. Are we good to go?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.794
- Yeah. Got your Insulin?
- Yes, I do.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.027

21:42.051 --> 21:44.087

That's... it's gonna be what it's gonna be.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.805
- Oh... are you sure?
- It's fine.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.703
"Do not get out
of your vehicle at any time."

21:51.727 --> 21:54.218
- Oh, this is cool.
- "Do not exceed 30 km/h."

21:54.313 --> 21:56.349
- "Do not litter."
- Here we are.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.850
- Okay.
- Okay.

- Wow, wow, wow.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.297
- I'm so excited.
- I can't believe it.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.007
- Okay. I'm a little bit excited.
- How are you?

22:04.031 --> 22:07.114
Oh, she's gonna try
and sell you something, mom.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.012
They're so pretty!
Zoe, are you seeing this?

22:09.036 --> 22:11.448
No. Mom. They're like 20 bucks.

Hi, there. Hi.
Good morning. Ah, jambo.

- Please, please.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.388
- Did you bring...
- We don't need a belt.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.114
Why you need a belt?
They're so beautiful!

22:32.142 --> 22:34.679
- Hi!
- Look, it's real official-looking.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.603
- Hey, what's going on?
- What do we need a belt for?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.000
Don't... don't waste our money, honey.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.356

- Made... made here. Made in China.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.104
- Jack...
- Oh, no, thanks.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.154
- Wow. What's going on over there?
- They caught more poachers.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.441
I thought they said poaching
wasn't really a thing here.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.679
They don't look like poachers.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.614
And what are poachers
supposed to look like?

22:52.705 --> 22:53.705
Not tourists.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.826
Those bastards kill, like,
1,000 rhinos a year.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.409
- Holy shit. That's three rhinos a day.
- That's quick math, hon.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.565
Wait, so you don't think
we'll see a rhino?

23:01.589 --> 23:03.295
You don't have to sound too shocked, Jack.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.997
Nah, sorry, Mrs. H.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.501
No, no. Over there.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.210
No, no, no. Over there. Over there.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.465
- Where?
- There.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.716
What?

25:58.807 --> 26:03.096
The dead thing in the tree right there.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.052
- Ugh.
- What is that, a deer?

26:05.147 --> 26:07.333
- Maybe an antelope or something?
- How did it even get up there?

26:07.357 --> 26:09.143
- Jump?
- And get stuck?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.441
- Can they climb?
- No, I don't think so.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.358
Geez.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.279
That's gross. Billy, that's gross.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.605
- Gross?
- It's dead.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.988
It's... it's wildlife.
There's flies there. They're alive.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.029
Billy!

26:24.124 --> 26:26.331
All right, hold on. Hold on.

26:28.879 --> 26:29.981
Wait, wait. Can I get a picture?

26:30.005 --> 26:32.747
- No, you can't get a picture, Noah.
- Ew. Are you a serial killer?

26:32.841 --> 26:34.502
- What?
- Don't take a picture of that.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.112
We're not gonna see
another animal in a tree.

26:36.136 --> 26:39.173
I'm sure we will see lots of dead animals.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.424
I'm gonna send it to Sam.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.760
- Dad?
- Yeah, bud.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.719
Can I drive for a bit?

26:47.815 --> 26:50.602
Um... well, it's a stick.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.102
I can drive a stick.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.840
I don't know, pal. I don't think
the insurance will cover you again.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.526
What? You said you were
all about breaking the rules today.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.359
Come on, Jack. Let him drive.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.389
Okay, all right. All right, bud.
Yeah, you can drive.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.725
- Well, that's us dead.
- I'm actually a really good driver.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.081
I think the back of dad's Porsche
would disagree with that.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.534
That was not my fault. I buffed it out.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.371
- At least I have a license.
- Hey, I can drive.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.665
- She can drive.
- I can drive.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.152
Not according to the state of California.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.445
- Guys, guys, guys.
- That's just a piece of paper.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.530

You got insurance?

We've got no car, no signal.

How about a little equality?

34:15.262 --> 34:17.489
Someone will realize that we haven't
checked back into the lodge.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.514
No, they won't.

Do you remember?
No one knows that we're here.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.989
Okay, so we go back out onto one
of the main roads and get some help.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.583
I mean, there were cars
that were passing by.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.813
We can't go walking through the bush.
That's crazy!

34:29.900 --> 34:31.587
Aren't you supposed to wait
by where the accident happened?

34:31.610 --> 34:32.964
- That's right.
- That's what they teach you.

34:32.987 --> 34:36.275
- Wait, and then someone comes.
- On a closed back road?

34:36.366 --> 34:39.152
Yeah, exactly. How is anyone
gonna find us here?

34:39.244 --> 34:42.077
- We start a fire.
- That's a good idea.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.745
Okay, can you start a fire?

34:44.833 --> 34:48.121
I saw it on TV. Naked and afraid?

34:48.210 --> 34:50.748
You know, they do it all the time.
Rub sticks together.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.375
Yeah, you can start a fire.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.330
Just take the battery wires
from the sparkplug

34:54.426 --> 34:55.541
and make it short-circuit.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.001
How are you gonna do that?

34:58.096 --> 35:00.366
The current hasn't stopped
because the terminal's fucked.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.510
You know, that's not as dumb
as it sounds, sweetheart.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.968

- Yeah.

Okay. Here it goes.

- Yeah.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:49.393
- Dad, they're coming.

What do we do?

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:17.914
- Hey! Hey!
- Come down!

01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:19.415
Over here! Over here!

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.340
Oh, my god.

My god! I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you!

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.682

- Hah.

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.305
What the hell are you doing out here?

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.202
Stay right there. I'm...
I'm getting some helps.

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:54.572
Helps! Help! Come fast.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.784
There's a man in the car.
Come, come. He's hurt.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.079
We found him outside in a van.

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:03.547
Goodness.

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:05.394
We found him in the forest.
Blood everywhere.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.465
We must get him help quick.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:09.966
Slowly. Be careful.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.797
I'll hold him.

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.805
I think it was
somewhere around here.

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:18.764
I don't know, we went off road.
I wasn't paying attention.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:21.645
That's impossible. All the vehicles
in the park are accounted for.

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:24.352
No, we drove through
without paying, never checked in.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.403
Okay. We need to move him out.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:27.971
Get everybody ready. We're going out.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:51.845
We have new friends, Charlie.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.175
There we go. Charlie's got you.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:57.893

Hey, uh, Charlie,
is camp ready for guests?

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.518
- Yeah, we're good, boss.
- Okay.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:08.396
Let's go.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.573
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, it's not a problem.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.241
You guys will be fine.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.818
What were you doing out there?

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:15.553
You have no idea what we've been through.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:19.449
It's fine. You're all okay.
Put him... put him by the fire.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:22.035
By the fire.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.754
You guys will be fine now.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.925
- There we go.
- Thank you.

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:35.135
- Baby. Okay...
- What is going on with her?

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:38.343
She's diabetic. She needs insulin.

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.143
Insulin? We don't have insulin.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.517
The nearest medical center
is two hours away.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.849
Can you call for help?

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:47.401
- She's dying.
- How long does she have?

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.319
Not long. Please call someone.

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:52.899
- Call anyone.
- Got the SAT phone.

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:55.701
- Thank you. Thank you.
- See if we can get a signal.

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:58.951
- It's okay, baby.
- Just getting a signal here.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:04.710
I'm trying to get a signal. These things
are always supposed to have a signal.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:07.914
Come on.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.757
Why is there no signal?

01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:14.264
This is crazy.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:19.183
SAT phones are always supposed
to give you a signal here. Hold on.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:26.599
I wish you hadn't seen that.

01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:32.064
Seen what? Zoe, what's going on?

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:36.572
They're poachers, dad.

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:37.742
- What?
- They're poachers.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.947
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:45.411
We do not like to use... the p-word.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:48.962
It's like I said back at the airport,
when we first met.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:53.714
We help indigenous people
make the best use of their resources.

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:55.795
By butchering wildlife?

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:58.757
Right now, I-I don't care what you do.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.716
Dad, they killed that...

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.847
Stop, Noah. No, no, stop. Okay?

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:06.147
It's none of our business.
We... we just need your help.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:07.586
Oh, my god, they weren't gonna help us.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.817
- Were you?
- No.

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.149
Tie them up.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:30.962
Hey, asshole.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:37.136
Yeah, you.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:39.088
You know how many rhino are left?

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:41.469
Enough to make them valuable?

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.622
Valuable enough for these men
to earn more in one night

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:45.227
than they would the whole year.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.396
Enough to feed their families.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:49.939
You're disgusting.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:56.128
Do you think their children should starve?

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.695
No, I don't think their children
should starve.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:00.947
Well, so then we... we agree

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:05.247
that they have the right
to benefit from their own land.

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:07.791
From their own heritage.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.290
What gives you the right?

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:14.124
Some privileged, ignorant, white...

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.834
Fuck off. Fuck off!

To dictate anything these people do.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.701
- Dad?
- I'm sure that you're making

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:22.160
- a healthy profit out of them.
- Fuck off.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.347
Let's just call it capitalism,
my friend.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:28.771
- You-you work in the oil business, right?
- Charlie's right.

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:32.107
Charlie is absolutely right.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:37.564
Oilman, you're not allowed
to get all holier-than-thou with us.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:40.570
I mean, what-what is
the worst that we do?

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:44.495
- Yeah.
- A few less rhinos in the world.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.288
Maybe an elephant?

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.865
A pangolin?

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.078
You know how much this is worth?

01:15:56.635 --> 01:16:00.969
It's worth more than its weight in gold.

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:05.925
And we're nothing compared to you.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:08.386
Don't even compare.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.307

Well, the end of your story is easy.

Obviously, mom's about to die,

As for the rest of you,
we are going to move out.

We usually let the hyenas
clean up after us,

though they prefer their animals injured,

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:41.256
