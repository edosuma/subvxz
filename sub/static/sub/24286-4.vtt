WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:08.592
Hey, Tiffany, you have a second?

00:08.592 --> 00:10.594
- For you, I got 20.
- Great.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.597
Um... okay, uh...

00:13.597 --> 00:15.599
You know Terry busted
the dishwasher,

00:15.599 --> 00:18.728
and bills are piling up.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.896
I'm gonna have to get a job,
really, any job.

00:20.896 --> 00:24.108
So I need you
to help me out more with...

00:24.108 --> 00:27.528
or really at all, with the kids.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.238
No problem.

00:29.238 --> 00:32.031
Not to toot my own horn,
but toot-toot,

00:32.031 --> 00:34.535
I did a pretty good job
of raising my own kids.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.831
Don't worry about
this moldy old tent

00:38.831 --> 00:40.750
messing up your kitchen.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.296
It's going in the living room.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.343
I supposed I could
step it up a bit.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.720
Thank you.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.555
And there...
there is one more thing.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.182
- Um...
- Uh-huh?

00:56.182 --> 00:59.685
I really need you to stop
having all of your...

00:59.685 --> 01:03.272
your gentlemen callers come by.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.357
Beth, God,

01:05.357 --> 01:07.151
you... you have
the wrong idea about me.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.737
- I am not that kind of woman.
-

01:09.737 --> 01:11.447
Well, there's no judgment.

01:11.447 --> 01:13.324
I just can't have the boys
seeing you bring home

01:13.324 --> 01:15.367
every Tom, Dick, and Harry.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.869
Okay...

01:16.869 --> 01:20.289
we got to hit the road, Tiff.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.458
For the record,
his name is Joe.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.925 --> 02:15.427
Uh, what are you doing,
Uncle Terry?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.346
I was, uh...

02:17.346 --> 02:19.306
I was starting to feel like
a guest on the sofa,

02:19.306 --> 02:23.269
but I want to be more permanent
around here, so, uh...

02:23.269 --> 02:26.188
I'm creating my own
personal living space.

02:26.188 --> 02:29.900
I guess that makes sense,
kind of.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.610
Hey, what's with the lemons?

02:31.610 --> 02:32.820
You know, if you want to learn
about juggling,

02:32.820 --> 02:34.488
your Uncle Terry's the man.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.323
I spent two weeks
at Cirque du Soleil camp...

02:36.323 --> 02:38.242
till I got into a fight
with a loud-mouthed mime.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.286
No one puts me
in an invisible box.

02:40.286 --> 02:41.704
No, actually,
I was thinking

02:41.704 --> 02:43.163
of opening up
my own lemonade stand,

02:43.163 --> 02:44.790
and giving the money to Mom.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.625
That's a great idea.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.752
You know, your father and I
did that when we were kids.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.504
You... you... you should use
the, uh, the... the... the...

02:50.504 --> 02:52.548
that crazy lemon squeezer
he invented for us.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.466
I think I saw it
down in the basement,

02:54.466 --> 02:56.385
last time I accidentally
locked myself in the basement.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.887
You know what?
I'll go get it.

02:57.887 --> 02:59.471
You just keep
airing this tent out.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.931
Yeah, and don't worry
about the spiders.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.516
Those little eight-legged
bloodsuckers

03:02.516 --> 03:04.393
are more scared of you
than you are of them,

03:04.393 --> 03:05.477
especially the babies.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.438
Spiders?

03:07.438 --> 03:09.398
As a spelling bee runner-up,

03:09.398 --> 03:12.192
it hurts to write
"olde" with an E.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.195
Also, I'm pretty sure
that "timey" isn't a word.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.823
Liam told me to write that
because we're building a brand,

03:17.823 --> 03:20.367
and nostalgia is very now,

03:20.367 --> 03:21.911
whatever that means.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.662
Check out my dad's Squeezerator.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.581
You put lemons in like this,

03:25.581 --> 03:28.375
and...

03:28.375 --> 03:30.044
press the red button.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.837
- - Ta-da.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.924
- That's amazing...
-

03:34.924 --> 03:37.009
And it's definitely
gonna give me nightmares.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.094
You guys have
a serious problem.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.013
Those new neighbor kids opened
their own lemonade stand

03:41.013 --> 03:42.723
around the corner.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.184
They've got free Krazy Straws
and a shade-brella.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.769
Isn't there room

03:46.769 --> 03:49.146
for more than one lemonade stand
in the neighborhood?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.566
Of course not.
Haven't you read "Outliers"?

03:52.566 --> 03:55.027
Or any Gladwell at all?

03:55.027 --> 03:57.905
Oh, boys, you are so lucky
that I'm here.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.198
I'm going to give you
the benefit

03:59.198 --> 04:01.241
of my prodigious
business acumen.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.243
I have no idea what that means.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.162
That means
when life gives you Liam,

04:05.162 --> 04:07.790
you make Liam-ade.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.291
I think we'll be okay
on our own.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.210
That's what
Bernard J. Whittle said.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.337
Who's Bernard J. Wittle?

04:13.337 --> 04:15.214
Exactly.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.096
- Here you go.
- Enjoy.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.681
Tell your friends!

04:23.681 --> 04:26.100
And tell them I had
nothing to do with the spelling.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.852
Hey, look,
it's Bobby and Tyra,

04:28.852 --> 04:31.397
those neighbor kids
Liam was talking about.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.065
Hey, guys!

04:33.065 --> 04:36.276
How's it going
with the lemonade... stand?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.657
- No!
- No! Please stop!

04:41.657 --> 04:43.909
- Ah!
-

04:43.909 --> 04:46.412
Those jerks.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.456
Why is this water sticky?

04:49.456 --> 04:51.500
It's Mountain Dew!

04:51.500 --> 04:53.377
I'm not allowed
to drink this stuff.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.713
My mom says it gives me
the sugar shakes.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.971
Okay...

05:03.971 --> 05:06.098
getting the Astrovan clean.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.933
You know, needs to be
semi-presentable

05:07.933 --> 05:11.103
if I'm gonna be driving
rideshare customers around.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.564
So, listen, guys,
Tiffany's gonna be watching you

05:13.564 --> 05:15.816
a little more
now that I have a job,

05:15.816 --> 05:18.902
so I need you to mind her.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.613
Got it, Mom.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.198
Malcolm Gladwell
and I warned you.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.200
- - Business is war.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.495
But you can't just fold after
one minor market disruption.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.414
You're right.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.874
I need to get even.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.376
An excellent counterstrategy.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.920
Leave it up to my brains
and Dash's brawn.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.714
I have brains, too.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.341
I just like to use them
for breaking stuff.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.135
Whoa, whoa, guys,

05:43.135 --> 05:46.221
I never said I wanted
to break anything.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.140
Don't be so sure.

05:48.140 --> 05:52.019
Free love is great,
but revenge is sweet, too.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.773
No, no. No one's getting
revenge on anyone.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.691
What kind of advice is that?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.152
The same kind
my mom's mom gave me.

06:00.152 --> 06:03.614
Of course, she was the enforcer
on her roller derby team.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.872
Hey. What are you doing?

06:11.872 --> 06:14.416
Just laying out my bienvenue.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.335
That's French for "welcome mat."

06:16.335 --> 06:18.045
No, what are you doing
to my house?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.339
Uh, increasing its value.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.715
I just added an extra bedroom

06:21.715 --> 06:24.259
and a quarter bath.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.762
Oh. Um, okay...

06:26.762 --> 06:28.889
Terry, this is...

06:28.889 --> 06:30.974
this is a terrible idea.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.061
You sound...
you sound just like Patty.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.896
It's like that time, the...
the one time I went to him

06:35.896 --> 06:38.023
with my own idea
for an awesome invention,

06:38.023 --> 06:39.525
and he...
he didn't get it either.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.568
When was this?

06:41.568 --> 06:44.154
It was a few years ago.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.906
He said my idea was stupid,

06:45.906 --> 06:47.324
and so I said,
"No, you're stupid."

06:47.324 --> 06:48.826
And that's
kind of ridiculous,

06:48.826 --> 06:51.912
'cause he was
the smartest guy I knew.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.456
We got into this whole fight,
and I... I... I stormed out.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.126
Really? He never told me that.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.546
That was the last thing
I ever said to my brother.

07:00.546 --> 07:04.133
- Um, I...
- Oh, Terry...

07:04.133 --> 07:05.759
Oh...

07:07.761 --> 07:09.638
I... I...

07:09.638 --> 07:11.515
I thought there'd be time
to fix it, you know.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.851
I thought...

07:13.851 --> 07:15.769
I thought I could make it right.
I should've called him.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.980
I... I...

07:17.980 --> 07:19.982
There wasn't any time.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.025
Yeah, I know how you feel.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.236
I mean, there's never
enough time, you know.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.196
I still have so many things

07:26.196 --> 07:28.282
I want to talk to Patrick
about, too, but...

07:28.282 --> 07:30.367
- - Oh, my waffles are ready.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.244
- -

07:35.122 --> 07:36.832
Hi, Sam. Come on in.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.042
Wyatt, Sam's here.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.044
Oh, hey, Sam. What's up?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.963
I'm quitting
the lemonade business.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.840
Consider this
my two-minute notice.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.925
What

07:46.925 --> 07:49.720
Bobby and Tyra hired
that big seventh grader,

07:49.720 --> 07:51.388
who's already shaving,

07:51.388 --> 07:54.099
and they crammed me
in a locker after school.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.351
Those guys are such jerks.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.562
I'm sorry, Wyatt,

07:58.562 --> 08:00.272
but I need to
stay alive long enough

08:00.272 --> 08:02.357
to find out how
the "Star Wars" movies end.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.072
Uncle Terry?

08:09.072 --> 08:11.116
Our armies
are ready for victory,

08:11.116 --> 08:12.492
but we shall reconvene tomorrow.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.204
That is all for now.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.290
And, Achilles,
tend to that heel.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.882
Hey, champ. How's it going?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.592
Not good.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.094
These kids are really
messing with me, Dad.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.388
I'm so mad, I don't know
what I feel like doing.

08:33.388 --> 08:36.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now,
slow your roll there, buddy.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.518
Let's take a cue
from our friend, Achilles.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.729
He also got mad, and you know
what happened to him.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.898
He became a hero?

08:42.898 --> 08:44.441
Well, yeah, he did,

08:44.441 --> 08:46.193
but he also died in battle

08:46.193 --> 08:47.986
after launching
an all-out attack on Troy.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.655
Now, look, the Greeks won,

08:49.655 --> 08:51.240
but only because they got
a little sneaky.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.116
- My point is...
- Ah! I will destroy you

08:53.116 --> 08:55.410
with my laser sword!

08:55.410 --> 08:57.621
Wait a minute,
that's a bug zapper.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.915
- No, it's a...
-

08:59.915 --> 09:02.209
- Dang, it is a bug zapper.
- Told you.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.836
See, this is a laser sword.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.756
- Run!
-

09:07.756 --> 09:09.883
Hold on a sec.
This I got to see.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.344
No, Wyatt, Wyatt, we got to talk
about what's going on with you!

09:16.515 --> 09:19.226
Are you sure
you don't want a waffle?

09:22.688 --> 09:25.399
Tiffany, seriously?

09:25.399 --> 09:26.900
I thought you were
making lunches

09:26.900 --> 09:28.735
and helping the kids
with their homework.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.530
For your information, I have
excellent reasons for that.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.490
Which are?

09:33.490 --> 09:35.367
- Oh, you want to hear them?
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.202
Okay...

09:37.202 --> 09:40.330
Homework is just
a mind-control tool

09:40.330 --> 09:43.333
used by the dominant paradigm
to subjugate its citizenry.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.712
Uh-huh. And lunch?

09:46.712 --> 09:49.506
- Give me a second on that one.
- Oh, you are unbelievable.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.967
All I asked

09:51.967 --> 09:54.094
was that you help out
a little with the kids,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.929
and this is what I get?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.974
Who do you think
I'm beading these necklaces for?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.812
In case they ever get a cat.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.691
I need your help.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.901
I want to get even with
those idiot neighbor kids.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.070
I've been expecting you,
grasshopper.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.323
- Who-hopper?
- Don't worry about it.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.742
Come sit at my feet,
while I devise a clever plan.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.166
- What do you have there, Dash?
- Nothing. Butt out.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.501
Whatever.
It's revenge time. Listen up.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.420
Word on the street is
the neighbors have muscled up,

10:28.420 --> 10:30.630
so we're gonna have to
get super sneaky.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.425
Sneaky.
Sneaky like the Greeks.

10:33.425 --> 10:36.511
- I like it.
- You lost me.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.972
And I was already
a little lost to begin with.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.516
You know how they used
a Trojan Horse to win the war.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.643
Maybe we could do
something like that.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.271
I've read all about it in
Dad's chapter on the Trojan War.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.148
Well played, Wyatt.
You get a cookie.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.193
We have cookies?

10:51.193 --> 10:53.695
Trojan Horse it is.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.406
We'll put you inside
that empty patio-furniture box

10:56.406 --> 10:59.242
in the basement and leave it
at the neighbor's gate.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.995
They'll bring it into the yard,
you'll slip out a trapdoor,

11:01.995 --> 11:05.540
sabotage their
lemonade supply, and...

11:05.540 --> 11:07.876
And replace
their sugar with salt.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.128
That will ruin everything.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.422
I like it. Dash, you in?

11:12.422 --> 11:14.800
Hey, you had me at "cookies."

11:19.805 --> 11:21.598
Can you drive quickly?

11:21.598 --> 11:22.849
I have a job interview,
and I want to get there early.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.685
No problem. You need, I speed.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.563
- - What the...

11:28.563 --> 11:31.066
Oh...
oh, no, I'm so sorry.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.026
That's my son's pudding cup.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.529
This can't be happening,
not today!

11:35.529 --> 11:38.448
Oh, wait, don't go!
Um... I need this job,

11:38.448 --> 11:40.951
and I really can't afford
another zero-star rating,

11:40.951 --> 11:43.829
so I promise you,
I can fix this.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.747
Also...

11:45.747 --> 11:48.417
there's a half a grilled cheese
stuck to your briefcase.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.798
- -

11:59.302 --> 12:02.139
Remember, stay quiet.
You're furniture.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.224
I got it, Dash. Go.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.111
Hey. Here we go.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.904
No one will ever know.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.366
So, would you recommend me
to your friends?

12:21.366 --> 12:23.034
- You were fine.
-

12:23.034 --> 12:25.537
- Kind of messy, though.
- Sure, sure.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.456
Look what somebody
was throwing out...

12:27.456 --> 12:29.249
or at least left
close enough to the curb

12:29.249 --> 12:31.042
so that it could be
considered public property?

12:31.042 --> 12:33.044
Hey. Nice calves.
You a runner?

12:33.044 --> 12:36.631
So, who's bringing who home
around here?

12:36.631 --> 12:39.301
Oh, no, he's my client.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.219
No, I... I mean,
I picked him up.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.054
No, I... that's not...
that's not what I meant.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.431
That's not what I meant. No...

12:44.431 --> 12:46.224
You people are nuts!

12:46.224 --> 12:48.435
- Hey, that's my kimono!
- Yep, he's a runner.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.145
Okay, well, great, you guys,

12:50.145 --> 12:51.688
because there goes
our new dishwasher, so...

12:51.688 --> 12:54.649
Wait, please,
I can make this right!

12:54.649 --> 12:56.610
Beth hired a dishwasher?

12:56.610 --> 12:58.403
I thought we were
tight on money.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.113
Tiffany, check it out.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.781
Oh, yeah.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.867
Best seat in the house.

13:03.867 --> 13:04.826
Okay!

13:12.209 --> 13:14.711
Coast is clear.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.691
We'll do it later, Mom!

13:36.691 --> 13:39.528
No, you'll put it away now.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.738
I'll be right there!

14:03.718 --> 14:05.720
Oh, my God,
Wyatt's stuck in the box.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.973
Why is Wyatt in a box?

14:07.973 --> 14:10.475
Oh, yeah, I totally forgot
about that.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.061
Come on!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.983
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you boys headed?

14:17.983 --> 14:19.609
- Outside.
- Upstairs.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.069
And where's Wyatt?

14:21.069 --> 14:23.697
- Outside.
- Upstairs.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.365
Okay.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.207
- It's locked.
- It's okay. We did our best.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.127
Every war has collateral damage.
Ours is Wyatt.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.463
We should get out of here
before his loss in vain.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.716
Why do you boys
bother lying to me?

14:42.716 --> 14:45.552
I've been lying to the man
since the man was a little boy.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.178
Where's Wyatt?

14:47.178 --> 14:49.264
He's trapped in a box
in this backyard.

14:49.264 --> 14:52.183
That's a new one. Stand aside.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.735
Tiffany, one, the man, zero.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.820
Nice moves.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.238
I'm impressed.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.329
I am no longer impressed.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.873
What are you guys
doing here?

15:14.873 --> 15:17.375
I don't like your tone,
young lady.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.086
That's no way
to talk to... guests.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.755
And I especially don't like

15:21.755 --> 15:23.381
that you attacked
Wyatt's lemonade stand.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.091
What are you talking about?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.843
He attacked us first.

15:26.843 --> 15:30.305
Yeah, he bombed us with
Super Soakers for no reason.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.516
That's what started it all.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.226
Is this true?

15:35.226 --> 15:37.187
It was a preemptive strike.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.690
No, we just did it to them
before they could do it to us.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.903
Okay, sounds like there's plenty
of blame here to go around.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.448
Oh, wh... what? Take cover!

15:52.911 --> 15:54.245
Ow! Ow!

16:01.419 --> 16:04.756
Well, don't just sit there.
Fight back!

16:04.756 --> 16:06.925
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

16:11.054 --> 16:12.722
- Oh!
-

16:19.854 --> 16:20.939
Hi, Wyatt.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.277
Welcome to the inside
of the Trojan Horse.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.698
I thought it would be
a lot... horsier.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.616
You should've been here
before I Febrezed the place.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.743
- - Hey...

16:33.743 --> 16:37.038
how long do you think
the Trojan War lasted?

16:37.038 --> 16:38.957
Well, this lemonade fight

16:38.957 --> 16:40.792
has been going on
for a couple of days,

16:40.792 --> 16:43.920
so... a week?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.464
Try ten years.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.049
Imagine that.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.468
That's crazy.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.221
This fighting stuff
is so confusing.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.599
A minute ago, I wanted to
crush those neighbor kids.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.936
Then I found out that everything
was Dash and Liam's fault.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.271
Everyone thinks
they have a good reason

17:01.271 --> 17:03.106
for starting the war,

17:03.106 --> 17:05.358
but there's really
no such thing.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.068
And there's
way better stuff to do

17:07.068 --> 17:10.613
than spending time
inside a sweaty old horse.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.991
I just wanted to help Mom out.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.242
I never wanted
all this fighting.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.913
I just wish I could stop it.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.790
You can.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.666
We all can.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.794
The key is to figure out how.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.421
I'll give you a hint.

17:26.421 --> 17:30.258
It usually starts
with an apology.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.469
Can I look through the eyehole?

17:32.469 --> 17:34.137
That's not the eyehole.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.765
The, uh, eyehole's
on the other end of the horse.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.475
- So what is...
-

17:38.475 --> 17:40.226
Oh.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.103
Never mind.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.397
So how do we get out?

17:44.397 --> 17:47.150
Well, there's the trapdoor
behind you or, uh...

17:47.150 --> 17:48.818
door number two.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.780
I vote the trapdoor.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.615
You chose wisely.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.242
Ow! Ow!

17:56.242 --> 17:58.620
Stop! Stop!

18:01.706 --> 18:03.792
This war has to end now.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.255
Fighting only leads
to more fighting, and for what?

18:09.255 --> 18:13.259
To win a few yards
of lemonade turf?

18:13.259 --> 18:16.054
Bobby, Tyra,

18:16.054 --> 18:18.348
I'm sorry for getting mad
and sneaking in here,

18:18.348 --> 18:20.225
and I'm especially sorry

18:20.225 --> 18:22.769
that my dumb brothers
attacked your lemonade stand.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.979
Technically,
I didn't do anything.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.526
Okay, okay.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.444
I'm sorry for messing with you.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.154
In hindsight,
I should've offered a buyout

18:33.154 --> 18:36.199
before going
right to hostile takeover.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.660
And I'm sorry
I Super-Soaked you guys.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.745
It was super stupid.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.581
I guess we overreacted, too.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.376
We're also sorry.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.587
So... friends?

18:52.423 --> 18:54.259
Nice work, Wyatt.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.220
Now, let's high-tail it home
before your mom busts us.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.888
Joe got us tickets to AC/DC,

18:58.888 --> 19:01.224
and I can't afford
to be grounded.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.022
Oh, hi, Beth.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.567
They say Blake Shelton
has three nipples,

19:10.567 --> 19:12.110
and their sources
are usually pretty...

19:12.110 --> 19:13.862
I know what happened.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.990
It's probably
just a birth defect.

19:16.990 --> 19:20.034
I got suspicious
when I saw you washing clothes

19:20.034 --> 19:22.287
and I hadn't
begged you to do it,

19:22.287 --> 19:25.540
so I asked the kids,
and they just... boof...

19:25.540 --> 19:28.585
folded like the laundry
you didn't.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.297
Ratted out by my own homies.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.923
That hurts.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.137
I'm sorry, Beth. I...

19:39.137 --> 19:41.347
I know I let you down.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.685
Cooking and homework,
it just isn't my...

19:45.685 --> 19:47.395
Thank you.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.272
What?

19:49.272 --> 19:51.441
A lot of grandmas...

19:51.441 --> 19:53.151
Right, sorry...

19:53.151 --> 19:56.279
Uh, a lot of...

19:56.279 --> 19:58.865
mothers who have children

19:58.865 --> 20:00.491
who have children,

20:00.491 --> 20:02.410
you know, they bake cookies

20:02.410 --> 20:05.455
for those children
of their children...

20:07.081 --> 20:09.876
But you, you risked
a lemon attack for them,

20:09.876 --> 20:12.503
and that means a lot to me.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.173
Oh, they mean a lot to me.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.842
They're extremely lovable,

20:17.842 --> 20:19.677
even that little sneak Liam.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.179
He's the one
who flipped on me, right?

20:21.179 --> 20:23.306
Okay...

20:23.306 --> 20:25.141
you want to help me
fold the laundry?

20:25.141 --> 20:27.226
No...

20:27.226 --> 20:28.645
but I will.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.822
Oh...

20:39.822 --> 20:42.867
- You gonged? - Uh, yeah.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.410
I found this weird note

20:44.410 --> 20:46.329
in the Great Battles section
of Dad's book.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.206
It's for you.

20:48.206 --> 20:51.751
It says, "Tell Uncle Terry
to look behind the family crest

20:51.751 --> 20:53.836
and tell him I'm sorry."

20:53.836 --> 20:56.464
What's the family crest?

20:56.464 --> 21:00.218
The McKenna blazon is
three lions on a fess sable.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.844
What?

21:01.844 --> 21:03.596
Over here. Come here.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.640
Have I not
shown you this before?

21:07.016 --> 21:09.560
Okay, that...

21:09.560 --> 21:12.355
is our family crest,

21:12.355 --> 21:15.525
and behind it is...

21:19.028 --> 21:21.072
...nothing.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.866
Wait.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.750
Oh, my God.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.551
The Lazy Lacer.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.428
What's a Lazy Lacer?

21:43.428 --> 21:45.930
This was the brilliant idea
I told your dad about...

21:47.515 --> 21:49.726
...the one he said was stupid,
but he, uh...

21:49.726 --> 21:51.811
he made it. He...

21:51.811 --> 21:53.312
he built it using my design.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.648
I mean, this... This is it.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.942
And he said
that he was sorry.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.823
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry, too.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.491
I'm sorry he's not here
right now,

22:05.491 --> 22:07.618
so I can give him
a big ol' bear hug.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.832
I am, too.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.045
How about we hug
each other, huh? Come on.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.721
- So what's this thing do?
- I'm glad you asked.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.431
Okay...

22:28.431 --> 22:30.308
you know how everybody wastes

22:30.308 --> 22:32.769
so much time every day
tying their own shoes?

22:32.769 --> 22:34.228
No, not really.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.646
Well, the Lazy Lacer
will do it for ya.

22:35.646 --> 22:36.856
Simply take your foot,

22:36.856 --> 22:38.775
put it on
the Lazy Lacer pedestal,

22:38.775 --> 22:41.944
and let the Lazy Lacer
do its magic.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.489
Push the button
and be ready to be amazed.

22:59.128 --> 23:02.256
It's nice and slow.
Interesting.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.093
Human kind will never have
to tie its own laces again.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.719
Ka-ching!

23:06.719 --> 23:08.304
Come on, let's go show everyone
how it works.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.764
In a few minutes.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.933
It's still working
on the first loop.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.810
Almost there.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.938
Yeah, I really thought
it'd go a little faster.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.198
What are you butt-faces
looking at?

23:27.198 --> 23:29.992
- Something you want to tell us?
- Yes.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.537
Get away from my bed.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.705
I'm talking about that.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.961
I've never seen that before
in my life.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.504
We saw you hide it
in the closet.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.799
And the bag says
"Dash's bag" on it.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.009
Fine.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.762
So it's a sunflower. Big deal.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.347
I read about them
in Dad's book,

23:51.347 --> 23:53.766
and I decided
to grow one on my own.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.477
But why were you
hiding it from us?

23:57.854 --> 23:59.772
I figured you guys
would laugh at me.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.150
So go ahead and laugh.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.113
No. Actually,
I think it's really cool.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.407
- You do?
- I do, too.

24:09.407 --> 24:12.034
Sunflower oil
is a growth industry.

24:12.034 --> 24:15.163
You're ground-flooring a massive
investment opportunity.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.748
- You guys want to check it out?
- Nope.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.375
Sure.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.968
- Hey, Wyatt

24:28.968 --> 24:30.761
Tell anyone about this,

24:30.761 --> 24:32.972
and I'm gonna shave off
your eyebrows while you sleep.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.270
Here you go, ma'am.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.563
Enjoy.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.151
I'd be careful if I was you.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.320
They're coming,
and they're super angry.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.780
- Who's coming

24:49.780 --> 24:50.823
Bobby and Tyra.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.200
Apparently their customers

24:52.200 --> 24:53.868
didn't appreciate
lemonade made with salt.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.661
- Who knew?
- See ya!

24:55.661 --> 24:59.790
Oh, no, I forgot to tell them
I swapped their sugar with salt.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.960
Tell my brain
to tell my legs to run!

25:02.960 --> 25:04.754
No, no, please...

25:04.754 --> 25:07.006
- -

25:07.006 --> 25:08.716
- -

25:08.716 --> 25:13.763
See

25:13.763 --> 25:16.224
See what you have done

25:18.309 --> 25:23.314
We look

25:23.314 --> 25:27.443
Upon the sea,
my wayward son

25:28.653 --> 25:30.988
You got caught with two hands
in the sugar bowl

25:30.988 --> 25:34.825
And your pocket's
full of plums

25:36.911 --> 25:40.706
Are you gonna stand there
and look me in the eye?

25:40.706 --> 25:42.708
Are you gonna run?

25:44.961 --> 25:48.756
So I pause to reflect upon

25:48.756 --> 25:52.802
What I might've done

25:52.802 --> 25:57.932
I think I'd cut and run

25:57.932 --> 26:01.269
Ooh

26:01.269 --> 26:08.276
I'd run

26:10.027 --> 26:12.822
Oh, but tell me

26:12.822 --> 26:15.533
Didn't we have fun?

26:17.868 --> 26:20.329
Just think
of all the bad ideas

26:20.329 --> 26:27.336
hat might've
never seen the sun

26:28.305 --> 26:34.622
