00:00.319 --> 00:02.169
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:06.669 --> 00:08.560
someone used this to berries extremely

00:08.960 --> 00:11.590
high-value cargo this will be the first

00:11.590 --> 00:14.670
remote operated vehicle in the cavern we

00:14.670 --> 00:15.850
have expectations that we're going to

00:15.850 --> 00:16.970
see man-made objects

00:16.970 --> 00:20.490
we're in the cavern now there's three

00:20.490 --> 00:24.470
square pretty square I mean what is that

00:24.470 --> 00:26.510
if they're wooden that's irrefutable

00:26.510 --> 00:31.169
proof that changes everything

00:31.169 --> 00:34.610
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.610 --> 00:36.230
where people have been looking for an

00:36.230 --> 00:39.330
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.330 --> 00:43.240
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.240 --> 00:46.640
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.640 --> 00:48.470
symbols carved into it

00:48.470 --> 00:52.400
even a 17th century Spanish coin to date

00:52.400 --> 00:56.010
six men have died trying to solve the

00:56.010 --> 00:57.010
mystery

00:57.010 --> 01:00.910
and according to legend one more will

01:00.910 --> 01:05.300
have to die before the treasure 
can be found

01:24.880 --> 01:28.340
as a new day begins on Oak Island Marty

01:28.340 --> 01:30.640
and Rick lagina turned their attention

01:30.640 --> 01:33.600
to this year's all-important goal to

01:33.600 --> 01:36.530
find a diver experienced enough and

01:36.530 --> 01:39.290
brave enough to get to the bottom of

01:39.290 --> 01:43.430
borehole 10x hey Brad hey guys

01:43.430 --> 01:46.680
to this end they along with dive expert

01:46.680 --> 01:49.350
John tapper have arranged to meet with

01:49.350 --> 01:54.420
certified saturation diver Brad Stabenow

01:54.420 --> 01:56.479
so Brad I understand you have a lot of

01:56.479 --> 01:58.560
experience with some of the things we

01:58.560 --> 02:02.439
need low vis deep water cold water yeah

02:02.439 --> 02:08.660
done a lot of deep stuff confined space

02:08.660 --> 02:15.560
have you seen this before not this close

02:15.560 --> 02:17.550
Brad Stabenow has worked as a

02:17.550 --> 02:19.310
professional Salvage diver

02:19.310 --> 02:22.540
in over 20 countries he's also used to

02:22.540 --> 02:25.270
dive in utilizing the trimix breathing

02:25.270 --> 02:28.030
system which combines oxygen with

02:28.030 --> 02:31.310
nitrogen and helium to ensure a diver

02:31.310 --> 02:33.620
does not experience the kind of narcotic

02:33.620 --> 02:36.080
effects associated with diving at

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
extreme depths

02:37.080 --> 02:41.130
so you've done saturation diving oh yeah

02:41.130 --> 02:43.370
how long you don't forward a given time

02:43.370 --> 02:47.349
loggers run with 74 days Oh 74 days of

02:47.349 --> 02:51.000
kind of pressure yep Wow what's

02:51.000 --> 02:53.870
incredible Brad Stabenow he's been to

02:53.870 --> 02:57.180
800 feet we're only asking him to do 160

02:57.180 --> 03:01.290
foot dive he has years of experience at

03:01.290 --> 03:04.210
those depths far exceeding those steps

03:04.210 --> 03:06.811
so what's the status of what we have

03:06.811 --> 03:09.360
here right now right now you have this

03:09.360 --> 03:12.190
size casing and concrete yeah that goes

03:12.190 --> 03:14.880
all the way doing 181 feet at the bottom

03:14.880 --> 03:18.450
you've got 27 inch pipe then you go down

03:18.450 --> 03:21.000
47 feet to the top of a cavern that we

03:21.000 --> 03:23.560
know is there okay and then there are at

03:23.560 --> 03:25.011
least three targets in there that we

03:25.011 --> 03:26.880
would like a human being to tell us what

03:26.880 --> 03:27.880
they are

03:27.880 --> 03:30.660
one is a post one is potentially a chest

03:30.660 --> 03:33.550
and the third believe it or not possibly

03:33.550 --> 03:38.440
a body they keep me leave that alone but

03:38.440 --> 03:40.710
you've got a cavity that's roughly ten

03:40.710 --> 03:42.769
foot by eight foot sort of elliptical

03:42.769 --> 03:45.080
but irregular okay and the other thing

03:45.080 --> 03:47.440
is is that there are two tunnels or we

03:47.440 --> 03:49.040
think are two tunnels you mean down

03:49.040 --> 03:51.629
below the case in the cabin the cavity

03:51.629 --> 03:53.379
and those would need to be explored as

03:53.379 --> 03:56.000
well okay before we do this dive we're

03:56.000 --> 03:57.800
gonna have an ROV come out to check out

03:57.800 --> 03:59.330
whatever can be done remotely and we'll

03:59.330 --> 04:00.800
have that information before you would

04:00.800 --> 04:04.019
go in there okay clearly there is a risk

04:04.019 --> 04:07.350
of a fatal event in diving that deep in

04:07.350 --> 04:10.940
a skinny hole with no visibility so we

04:10.940 --> 04:12.820
have to reduce that to an acceptable

04:12.820 --> 04:14.849
risk or we're not gonna do it okay so do

04:14.849 --> 04:15.849
you want to do this

04:15.849 --> 04:22.690
yeah okay doesn't bother you the 27 it

04:22.690 --> 04:26.410
doesn't bother no it's pretty straight

04:26.410 --> 04:27.410
there's your answer

04:27.410 --> 04:30.160
all right did he drop from heaven I

04:30.160 --> 04:32.250
don't know but he's perfect gentlemen

04:32.250 --> 04:33.950
all right Cheers

04:33.950 --> 04:37.419
all right we will get it together guys

04:37.419 --> 04:40.780
an important decision has been made

04:40.780 --> 04:43.240
Brad Stabenow will attempt the dangerous

04:43.240 --> 04:46.470
dive to the bottom of 10-x but not

04:46.470 --> 04:50.380
before Marty and Rick bring in an ROV or

04:50.380 --> 04:52.930
remote operated vehicle to get solid

04:52.930 --> 04:55.810
images of the 27-inch hole and the

04:55.810 --> 05:00.940
mysterious cavern below

05:00.940 --> 05:03.840
while Rick and Marty arrange for an ROV

05:03.840 --> 05:07.699
team to come up to explore 10x their

05:07.699 --> 05:10.250
partner Craig tester along with his son

05:10.250 --> 05:13.590
Drake and stepson Jack Begley are

05:13.590 --> 05:15.870
searching for clues and possibly

05:15.870 --> 05:18.970
treasure near the center of the island

05:18.970 --> 05:22.810
on the area known as lot 6

05:22.810 --> 05:28.550
hey guys let's get our equipment we'll

05:28.550 --> 05:32.680
head out on to lot six and see if we can

05:32.680 --> 05:38.300
actually find something when the 140

05:38.300 --> 05:40.229
acres of Oak Island were offered as

05:40.229 --> 05:43.000
parcels for sale by the British crown in

05:43.000 --> 05:48.259
1762 it was broken up into 32 for acre

05:48.259 --> 05:52.110
lots for more than two centuries the

05:52.110 --> 05:54.050
faithful treasure sites had been thought

05:54.050 --> 05:59.490
to exist on lot 18 lot 19 and on lot 20

05:59.490 --> 06:01.880
in addition to the swamp and the area

06:01.880 --> 06:05.120
known as Smith's Cove

06:05.120 --> 06:09.670
but today crack Jack and Drake have

06:09.670 --> 06:12.430
decided to explore one of the lots that

06:12.430 --> 06:14.480
has never been associated with the Oak

06:14.480 --> 06:19.230
Island mystery lot 6

06:19.230 --> 06:21.780
where the clearing is here you can see

06:21.780 --> 06:24.880
more of an opening that is the border

06:24.880 --> 06:27.720
between lot 5 and Lodge 6

06:27.720 --> 06:30.800
lon 6 is also of interest to the team

06:30.800 --> 06:34.500
for another very intriguing reason

06:34.500 --> 06:38.630
what's this Samuel Boggs property yeah

06:38.630 --> 06:40.820
Samuel ball was born into slavery in

06:40.820 --> 06:45.930
South Carolina in 1764 just ten years

06:45.930 --> 06:47.900
before the start of the American

06:47.900 --> 06:51.750
Revolution after fighting on the side of

06:51.750 --> 06:54.250
the British forces they won his freedom

06:54.250 --> 06:56.790
before emigrating to Nova Scotia in the

06:56.790 --> 06:58.630
late 1700s

06:58.630 --> 07:03.570
in 1786 ball purchased four acres of

07:03.570 --> 07:06.100
land on Oak Island for eight pounds

07:06.100 --> 07:08.740
sterling a huge amount for what was

07:08.740 --> 07:11.639
considered nothing more than rocky farm

07:11.639 --> 07:14.550
and grazing land

07:14.550 --> 07:16.430
what makes Samuel ball story of

07:16.430 --> 07:18.430
particular interest to treasure hunters

07:18.430 --> 07:21.720
is that at the time of his death in 1845

07:21.720 --> 07:25.360
the former slave turned cabbage farmer

07:25.360 --> 07:28.960
had purchased several more acres of land

07:28.960 --> 07:32.199
both on the mainland and oak island

07:32.199 --> 07:33.979
including lot six

07:33.979 --> 07:38.050
in fact samuel ball became one of the

07:38.050 --> 07:39.890
richest men in nova scotia

07:39.890 --> 07:44.539
but how could he have found part of the

07:44.539 --> 07:46.120
Oak Island treasure

07:46.120 --> 07:50.750
some two hundred years ago okay well

07:50.750 --> 07:52.870
let's get after it just looking for

07:52.870 --> 07:55.849
anything old whether it's a structure

07:55.849 --> 07:59.590
rocks anything we're hoping to find gold

07:59.590 --> 08:02.380
and something very old but anything that

08:02.380 --> 08:04.150
that takes us the next step forward

08:04.150 --> 08:05.449
towards finding the treasure would be

08:05.449 --> 08:06.449
great

08:14.849 --> 08:17.830
I got something here okay let's dig her

08:19.030 --> 08:24.220
up it's down like in one of the ruts

08:24.220 --> 08:31.690
cracked underneath the tree yeah seems

08:31.690 --> 08:36.929
like it's grown like into the tree just

08:36.929 --> 08:40.389
watch out man just make sure you're not

08:40.389 --> 08:46.699
behind me there we go

08:46.699 --> 08:48.639
Wow

08:48.639 --> 08:54.470
nothing is huge

08:54.470 --> 09:03.610
think of that we make what's on the tip

09:03.610 --> 09:07.009
of it

09:07.009 --> 09:08.329
the head of it then the other and what

09:08.329 --> 09:11.559
the other end yeah well looks like a

09:11.559 --> 09:16.089
hexagon yeah it does do you think it's a

09:16.089 --> 09:17.569
steak or do you think it used to be some

09:17.569 --> 09:21.519
sort of bolt oh it's like a steak I

09:21.519 --> 09:24.249
think the iron nail and obviously

09:24.249 --> 09:27.100
significant but is it fifty years old or

09:27.100 --> 09:29.679
is it two hundred and fifty years old

09:29.679 --> 09:31.829
should I keep moving just move back in

09:31.829 --> 09:39.649
that way a little bit clear it out okay

09:39.649 --> 09:42.290
suddenly jack gets another hit on his

09:42.290 --> 09:45.069
metal detector and this time it's

09:45.069 --> 09:47.579
indicating the presence of a non-ferrous

09:47.579 --> 09:50.410
or possibly precious metal such as

09:50.410 --> 09:51.929
silver or gold

09:51.929 --> 09:55.079
Hey found something beside tired

09:55.079 --> 10:05.529
good come in alright okay it's not

10:05.529 --> 10:09.869
conductive great about here how deep six

10:09.869 --> 10:12.290
inches okay

10:12.290 --> 10:26.509
yeah there you go great right there get

10:26.509 --> 10:34.079
it what is it

10:34.079 --> 10:38.360
what is it I'm not this on lot six near

10:38.360 --> 10:42.249
the center of Oak Island Craig tester

10:42.249 --> 10:44.660
his son Drake and his stepson Jack

10:44.660 --> 10:47.350
Begley have made an exciting discovery

10:47.350 --> 10:51.470
maybe a piece of chest hinge handle

10:51.470 --> 10:55.060
maybe yeah some sort of handle it looks

10:55.060 --> 10:57.350
like yeah there's a handle good call

10:57.350 --> 11:01.449
okay let's keep checking that area a

11:01.449 --> 11:03.839
little bit if Craig and his sons have

11:03.839 --> 11:06.209
found an object that was once owned by

11:06.209 --> 11:09.339
Samuel ball it could be that there are

11:09.339 --> 11:12.610
others in the vicinity if so perhaps

11:12.610 --> 11:14.769
they will provide important information

11:14.769 --> 11:16.939
about the former American slave who

11:16.939 --> 11:19.259
became one of oak islands largest and

11:19.259 --> 11:20.480
wealthiest property owners

11:20.480 --> 11:31.470
the other side to that gonna be possibly

11:31.470 --> 11:41.089
yeah all right look at that Craig

11:41.089 --> 11:42.910
it's definitely curved you know it's a

11:42.910 --> 11:45.399
little bit ornate not nothing super

11:45.399 --> 11:48.429
fancy but some sort of handle buckle

11:48.429 --> 11:51.209
something along that line okay let's hit

11:51.209 --> 11:54.690
it with the metal detector it's hard to

11:54.690 --> 11:57.970
tell exactly what we found but to me it

11:57.970 --> 12:00.309
looked old so we're hoping we find

12:00.309 --> 12:02.689
something here that tells us the who in

12:02.689 --> 12:05.850
the wind but but we don't know hey Craig

12:05.850 --> 12:06.850
yep

12:06.850 --> 12:11.299
come here getting hit I just haven't

12:11.299 --> 12:12.889
seen this before it looks a lot like

12:12.889 --> 12:15.529
rock wall so

12:15.529 --> 12:17.449
got a boulder here Boulder there and it

12:17.449 --> 12:19.199
looks like it's kind of going off right

12:19.199 --> 12:21.709
along the lot line

12:21.709 --> 12:24.279
zero Chris don't wall that's supposed to

12:24.279 --> 12:26.899
be here not that I know of

12:26.899 --> 12:32.790
look at how sharp this corners that's

12:32.790 --> 12:35.480
like cut Craig dig it up a bit

12:35.480 --> 12:42.239
yeah it's a straight edge on this other

12:42.239 --> 12:48.749
side too I'm not finding it yet their

12:48.749 --> 12:52.420
study was a small rock this time what's

12:52.420 --> 12:55.220
up with train give me a box around here

12:55.220 --> 12:59.049
so it's a triangle-shaped Rock could it

12:59.049 --> 13:02.629
be a natural formation or might it be a

13:02.629 --> 13:05.730
clue one of many triangle-shaped

13:05.730 --> 13:07.639
formations that have been found

13:07.639 --> 13:08.769
throughout the island

13:08.769 --> 13:20.569
watch out anything no obviously a huge

13:20.569 --> 13:21.569
difference between this side in the

13:21.569 --> 13:24.439
other side they're completely flat on

13:24.439 --> 13:27.459
one side and then the opposite side I'd

13:27.459 --> 13:30.170
say this is not natural

13:30.170 --> 13:32.679
according to many Oak Island theorists

13:32.679 --> 13:34.850
the presence of pyramid-shaped markings

13:34.850 --> 13:38.170
and stones is significant some even

13:38.170 --> 13:40.650
suggest that they offer proof of a

13:40.650 --> 13:43.569
direct connection between Oak Island and

13:43.569 --> 13:47.050
Freemasons who often use the symbol of a

13:47.050 --> 13:49.429
triangle to represent the Great Pyramids

13:49.429 --> 13:52.160
of Egypt as well as a symbol for the

13:52.160 --> 13:55.449
Great Architect of the universe is it

13:55.449 --> 13:58.019
possible that Craig and his sons have

13:58.019 --> 14:00.660
located a clue that will help them solve

14:00.660 --> 14:03.299
the Oak Island mystery

14:03.299 --> 14:04.999
should we just stop where we are now

14:04.999 --> 14:06.839
Phil back in the hole I think we ought

14:06.839 --> 14:07.990
to get back to show them what we've

14:07.990 --> 14:10.869
found all right

14:10.869 --> 14:16.489
before the end of what has been a long

14:16.489 --> 14:19.489
and productive day Rick and Marty lagina

14:19.489 --> 14:23.680
have one large task to perform for

14:23.680 --> 14:25.980
safety reasons they need to fill in the

14:25.980 --> 14:28.709
20-foot deep hole they recently dug in

14:28.709 --> 14:31.299
order to find the head and shaft so we

14:32.299 --> 14:33.929
know exactly where the head and shaft is

14:33.929 --> 14:35.839
which should help us orient as we

14:35.839 --> 14:38.619
further explore where the original money

14:38.619 --> 14:41.799
pit was for brothers Rick and Marty

14:41.799 --> 14:44.649
lagina the recent discovery of the head

14:44.649 --> 14:47.350
and shaft the searcher shaft dug by

14:47.350 --> 14:51.239
treasure hunter Gilbert Hedden in 1937

14:51.239 --> 14:53.069
has become one of the team's biggest

14:53.069 --> 14:56.689
accomplishments so far

14:56.689 --> 14:58.809
looks like it's right here there's a

14:58.809 --> 15:03.350
beam that Rick is amazing we have found

15:03.350 --> 15:06.199
it that is clearly the exterior wall of

15:06.199 --> 15:09.980
the old head and shaft because the head

15:09.980 --> 15:12.129
and shaft was known to be in close

15:12.129 --> 15:14.439
proximity to the original Oak Island

15:14.439 --> 15:15.439
money pit

15:15.439 --> 15:19.040
finding it confirmed what Rick and Marty

15:19.040 --> 15:21.139
discovered last summer when drilling

15:21.139 --> 15:24.929
core samples in the area

15:24.929 --> 15:29.079
to a depth of an estimated 145 feet they

15:29.079 --> 15:31.809
found evidence of a wooden box covered

15:31.809 --> 15:34.439
in what looked to be a kind of concrete

15:34.439 --> 15:38.619
that's deathly cement upon closer

15:38.619 --> 15:41.660
examination the box seemed to match the

15:41.660 --> 15:44.799
description of a 7-foot tall so-called

15:44.799 --> 15:47.160
treasure vault first reported by

15:47.160 --> 15:50.309
treasure hunter William Chappell in 1897

15:50.309 --> 15:54.769
concrete and then wood that's the

15:54.769 --> 15:56.699
description that's what they found in

15:56.699 --> 16:01.889
the top of the vault

16:01.889 --> 16:03.779
finding both the head and shaft and

16:03.779 --> 16:06.410
evidence of the mysterious wooden vault

16:06.410 --> 16:08.859
confirmed that Rick and Marty have found

16:08.859 --> 16:11.649
the exact location of the money pit a

16:11.649 --> 16:14.379
location which because of excessive and

16:14.379 --> 16:16.179
careless digging during Prior

16:16.179 --> 16:19.019
excavations had been lost for more than

16:19.019 --> 16:21.040
100 years all right

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
let's fill it back in coming at you big

16:23.040 --> 16:24.040
boy

16:24.040 --> 16:29.819
to properly excavate the money pit will

16:29.819 --> 16:31.839
mean digging a hole that will need to be

16:31.839 --> 16:35.720
approximately 40 feet wide and 150 feet

16:35.720 --> 16:36.720
deep

16:36.720 --> 16:39.449
and with equipment much larger than what

16:39.449 --> 16:41.879
the team currently has at their disposal

16:41.879 --> 16:46.390
they will also need to shore it up in

16:46.390 --> 16:49.279
such a way as to prevent the kind of

16:49.279 --> 16:50.989
flooding and Cabot's that have plagued

16:50.989 --> 16:52.839
treasure hunters on the island for more

16:52.839 --> 16:59.989
than 200 years

16:59.989 --> 17:01.709
so we got this filled back in yeah but

17:01.709 --> 17:03.519
we still need to explore this bugger

17:03.519 --> 17:05.619
this went into a cavity covered by a

17:05.619 --> 17:09.289
cement like material so we need to image

17:09.289 --> 17:10.289
it yeah

17:10.289 --> 17:12.409
Brian has to come back and Brian Abbott

17:12.409 --> 17:16.349
the sonar guy yeah absolutely

17:16.349 --> 17:18.709
Rick and Marty are hoping a sonar scan

17:18.709 --> 17:20.849
of the money pit similar to the one

17:20.849 --> 17:23.459
Brian Abbott did of 10x earlier this

17:23.459 --> 17:26.618
year will verify once and for all that

17:26.618 --> 17:28.919
there really is a treasure vault buried

17:28.919 --> 17:32.630
some 145 feet below

17:32.630 --> 17:33.680
we need to get that down there I mean

17:33.680 --> 17:35.600
look I got high hopes the only way it'll

17:35.600 --> 17:38.520
be worth digging here to 145 feet as if

17:38.520 --> 17:41.169
we see something otherwise we're not

17:41.169 --> 17:46.659
we're not doing it

17:46.659 --> 17:49.470
as the Sun sets on Oak Island Rick

17:49.470 --> 17:52.120
lagina joins up with Dave Blankenship

17:52.120 --> 17:55.350
jack begley Oak Island historian Charles

17:55.350 --> 17:57.771
Barkhouse and veteran treasure hunter

17:57.771 --> 18:00.420
dan henskee at the nearby fo'c'sle

18:00.420 --> 18:02.769
Tavern okay guys I don't know about you

18:02.769 --> 18:04.750
but I'm glad to be here right now it's a

18:04.750 --> 18:07.380
long day you know Jack's you guys

18:07.380 --> 18:09.840
actually did some work on lot six right

18:09.840 --> 18:12.159
yeah I mean as you know we've been

18:12.159 --> 18:14.920
running some pretty strict grids trying

18:14.920 --> 18:18.250
to figure out if we can pinpoint a spot

18:18.250 --> 18:20.159
where there could have been the supposed

18:20.159 --> 18:22.460
encampment yeah well let me let me stop

18:22.460 --> 18:25.029
you there because lot six we've not

18:25.029 --> 18:26.860
looked at this is the first go-round for

18:26.860 --> 18:29.340
a lot six so you know the progression of

18:29.340 --> 18:30.340
ownership

18:30.340 --> 18:32.070
well the AH we do know that at one time

18:32.070 --> 18:36.860
was Samuel ball home lot six yeah kind

18:36.860 --> 18:39.000
of primed it here have you fallen as I

18:39.000 --> 18:40.399
was saying I started looking for

18:40.399 --> 18:43.110
anything non iron move the detector

18:43.110 --> 18:45.990
around and got some more hints raid in

18:45.990 --> 18:48.269
the general area we finished digging

18:48.269 --> 18:50.919
everything up and at first we thought

18:50.919 --> 18:54.270
well maybe these are just pieces of some

18:54.270 --> 18:56.620
old nails right now where all these

18:56.620 --> 19:00.149
phones in one spot yep in the same hole

19:00.149 --> 19:03.750
well maybe that's just a bent nail

19:03.750 --> 19:06.120
we found another one from the pieces we

19:06.120 --> 19:09.260
found I think it looks like some sort of

19:09.260 --> 19:18.990
a chest handle the handle jack

19:18.990 --> 19:22.020
that's what inside the trousers well I'm

19:22.020 --> 19:23.960
doing my best David well let's get a

19:23.960 --> 19:26.280
little bit better than that those fines

19:26.280 --> 19:28.710
like this tie into you know your

19:28.710 --> 19:30.909
understanding of log six but as far as

19:30.909 --> 19:32.259
we know no one's ever done anything I

19:32.259 --> 19:33.330
don't know we just found it

19:33.330 --> 19:35.860
the curious thing you know you've told

19:35.860 --> 19:38.179
us some of the Samuel ball story but

19:38.179 --> 19:39.919
it's quite singular in the history of

19:39.919 --> 19:42.130
the island that this person comes you

19:42.130 --> 19:44.740
know freed slaves and at some point he

19:44.740 --> 19:46.909
becomes probably one of the largest lent

19:46.909 --> 19:49.970
order something yeah right no he wants

19:49.970 --> 19:52.090
the fact that he's associated with that

19:52.090 --> 19:56.100
is is interesting why was a lot six left

19:56.100 --> 19:58.330
undisturbed might that have been his

19:58.330 --> 20:01.220
treasure vault I don't know none of us

20:01.220 --> 20:03.440
know and thus we're looking was there

20:03.440 --> 20:05.039
anything else over there jack

20:05.039 --> 20:07.399
yeah there was this pyramid or

20:07.399 --> 20:10.250
triangular shaped rock that came up and

20:10.250 --> 20:13.429
we dug it up I don't know if it's a

20:13.429 --> 20:16.331
stone marker or if it's significant or

20:16.331 --> 20:18.059
not but it was surrounded by a bunch of

20:18.059 --> 20:21.379
granite boulders and then this stone was

20:21.379 --> 20:23.250
different and it looked like it may have

20:23.250 --> 20:26.799
been man-made

20:26.799 --> 20:29.929
you to investigate that rock whatever it

20:29.929 --> 20:30.929
is

20:30.929 --> 20:32.590
okay see if you think it's relevant you

20:32.590 --> 20:34.750
know dance theory a little bit of frets

20:34.750 --> 20:36.330
that are either that these markers

20:36.330 --> 20:39.490
stones if you will are important to the

20:39.490 --> 20:41.350
so called map above the ground so go

20:41.350 --> 20:43.529
back the three of you investigator you

20:43.529 --> 20:44.529
come up with

20:44.529 --> 20:46.710
we will sounds like a plan what do you

20:46.710 --> 20:48.980
what is Nova Scotian sir sociable

20:48.980 --> 21:00.600
sociable

21:00.600 --> 21:02.750
it is the start of another day on Oak

21:02.750 --> 21:05.760
Island like most it is filled with the

21:05.760 --> 21:08.610
promise of new information and possible

21:08.610 --> 21:13.179
discovery so we're at lot 6 and there's

21:13.179 --> 21:15.470
there's a couple stones that we found

21:15.470 --> 21:19.070
and it's an odd shape well let's have a

21:19.070 --> 21:21.080
look at it all right

21:21.080 --> 21:23.539
Jack Begley and Charles Barkhouse have

21:23.539 --> 21:25.919
returned to lot six with Stone

21:25.919 --> 21:28.760
researcher and area historian Terry

21:28.760 --> 21:31.990
Deveau they are hoping that Terry can

21:31.990 --> 21:33.799
tell them whether or not the

21:33.799 --> 21:36.139
triangle-shaped Rock they found is a

21:36.139 --> 21:38.600
natural formation it's just right up

21:38.600 --> 21:41.710
here all right or if it might have been

21:41.710 --> 21:45.440
intended as some kind of ancient marker

21:45.440 --> 21:47.340
one that will help them solve the Oak

21:47.340 --> 21:48.340
Island mystery

21:48.340 --> 21:51.250
we were running lines back and forth

21:51.250 --> 21:52.700
with the metal detector and clearing

21:52.700 --> 21:54.639
them a lot of brush away and as we were

21:54.639 --> 21:56.779
clearing the brush I saw this point

21:56.779 --> 21:58.259
sticking out okay

21:58.259 --> 22:01.809
and I came over and dug it up this type

22:01.809 --> 22:03.990
of greywacke which is common in this

22:03.990 --> 22:06.100
part of Nova Scotia does tend to

22:06.100 --> 22:09.920
naturally fracture with this type of a

22:09.920 --> 22:13.289
prismatic shape and to make very clean

22:13.289 --> 22:16.400
cleavage at times is there anything that

22:16.400 --> 22:18.899
stands out to you this one is pretty

22:18.899 --> 22:20.780
interesting because there there seems to

22:20.780 --> 22:24.000
be kind of an added piece to it this is

22:24.000 --> 22:25.730
almost like a cast of some kind that's

22:25.730 --> 22:28.440
been added on to make a point an added

22:28.440 --> 22:32.130
piece one design to make the stone form

22:32.130 --> 22:35.429
a perfect triangle could this strange

22:35.429 --> 22:38.070
triangle-shaped stone really be some

22:38.070 --> 22:40.870
sort of clue that's interesting yeah it

22:40.870 --> 22:43.271
doesn't it might have been used for a

22:43.271 --> 22:44.590
marker of some kind

22:44.590 --> 22:47.809
couldn't rule that out stone markers are

22:47.809 --> 22:49.519
usually not just one stone they're

22:49.519 --> 22:52.100
usually a pile of stones for example

22:52.100 --> 22:53.690
what about this stone over here there's

22:53.690 --> 22:58.660
no yeah it also has a flat surface if it

22:58.660 --> 23:01.269
was used either as a cover over here or

23:01.269 --> 23:03.850
as the back wall and then somebody later

23:03.850 --> 23:06.141
took it apart to see what was in there

23:06.141 --> 23:08.200
if there was anything in there with what

23:08.200 --> 23:10.580
stood out to me was that this was a

23:10.580 --> 23:12.750
depression right and that it was

23:12.750 --> 23:15.100
surrounded by rocks right someone may

23:15.100 --> 23:17.081
have come here and used this to bury

23:17.081 --> 23:20.299
treasure or something valuable we do

23:20.299 --> 23:21.730
know that there was a lot of smuggling

23:21.730 --> 23:23.470
going on both during the American War of

23:23.470 --> 23:26.250
Independence and the war of 1812 this

23:26.250 --> 23:28.990
was the hot spot of smuggling was Mahone

23:28.990 --> 23:31.610
Bay absolutely yeah if it was a

23:31.610 --> 23:33.289
smuggling type cache it would have to be

23:33.289 --> 23:36.570
an extremely high-value cargo if I had a

23:36.570 --> 23:38.970
treasure or something that I wanted to

23:38.970 --> 23:40.749
bury in the ground I'd be looking around

23:40.749 --> 23:41.749
for a spot like this

23:41.749 --> 23:46.029
throughout the 17th and 18th centuries

23:46.029 --> 23:48.840
and even much earlier the area in and

23:48.840 --> 23:51.549
around Nova Scotia was notorious as a

23:51.549 --> 23:53.860
haven for smugglers and privateers

23:53.860 --> 23:57.350
numerous small islands just off the

23:57.350 --> 24:00.539
mainland provided cover and offer the

24:00.539 --> 24:02.879
perfect places to bury and hide stolen

24:02.879 --> 24:05.880
goods and even treasure with little fear

24:05.880 --> 24:09.490
of detection or discovery

24:09.490 --> 24:10.500
Jack have you run the metal detector

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500
through here yep

24:11.500 --> 24:14.800
and funny thing not a thing I don't know

24:14.800 --> 24:16.942
exactly what a treasure cache would have

24:16.942 --> 24:18.960
looked like you know some people have

24:18.960 --> 24:20.899
the idea there were several of them all

24:20.899 --> 24:22.889
around the island just small caches here

24:22.889 --> 24:25.130
there and this really could be the

24:25.130 --> 24:28.769
remains of one of those when Samuel ball

24:28.769 --> 24:33.630
died on December 14th 1845 he left

24:33.630 --> 24:37.330
behind a wife and grandson but curiously

24:37.330 --> 24:40.320
he left his property on Oak Island to

24:40.320 --> 24:43.629
his servant Issac Butler along with a

24:43.629 --> 24:45.710
series of instructions that Butler was

24:45.710 --> 24:50.260
ordered never to reveal could it be that

24:50.260 --> 24:52.799
both Baal and Butler knew the secret of

24:52.799 --> 24:55.499
the Oak Island mystery a secret they

24:55.499 --> 24:57.809
ultimately took

24:57.809 --> 25:09.070
to their graves

25:09.070 --> 25:12.200
today Rick and Marty lagina are hoping

25:12.200 --> 25:14.529
to take another important step forward

25:14.529 --> 25:16.470
in their goal to get a diver to the

25:16.470 --> 25:19.980
bottom of 10x but before letting

25:19.980 --> 25:22.659
professional diver Brad Stabenow make

25:22.659 --> 25:25.679
the difficult and dangerous descent down

25:25.679 --> 25:29.360
the narrow 235 foot deep borehole they

25:29.360 --> 25:31.570
have decided to take one more

25:31.570 --> 25:42.450
precautionary measure I'm Craig they've

25:42.450 --> 25:45.179
hired Jake McNaughton and larae Davies

25:45.179 --> 25:48.210
from Dominion diving in nearby Dartmouth

25:48.210 --> 25:51.049
to send the video ray pro for remote

25:51.049 --> 25:54.490
operated vehicle or ROV to the bottom of

25:54.490 --> 25:59.020
the 235-foot deep shaft armed with a

25:59.020 --> 26:01.970
high-definition camera as well as sonar

26:01.970 --> 26:05.730
the ROV will for the first time be able

26:05.730 --> 26:08.570
to capture high-quality images of any

26:08.570 --> 26:10.389
dangerous obstructions that could

26:10.389 --> 26:11.440
undermine a dive

26:11.440 --> 26:14.290
it will also be able to move freely

26:14.290 --> 26:16.320
throughout the mysterious underground

26:16.320 --> 26:19.379
chamber and photograph any evidence of

26:19.379 --> 26:25.789
man-made objects or tunnels as we

26:25.789 --> 26:27.659
contemplate putting a diver in the hole

26:27.659 --> 26:29.360
they're gonna want every little bit of

26:29.360 --> 26:31.149
information possible that we can give

26:31.149 --> 26:33.870
them the ROV insertion is simply

26:33.870 --> 26:34.970
gathering more data

26:34.970 --> 26:37.039
why wouldn't we try it these are the

26:37.039 --> 26:38.480
whites I take it yep

26:38.480 --> 26:40.871
the LED lights camera here and there

26:40.871 --> 26:41.871
okay great

26:41.871 --> 26:43.809
and your highly skilled and can do

26:43.809 --> 26:45.010
acrobatics with it and everything right

26:45.010 --> 26:46.010
yeah

26:46.010 --> 26:47.720
the whole thing is all controlled from

26:47.720 --> 26:51.490
this okay the ROV will use its

26:51.490 --> 26:54.269
horizontal thrusters along with vertical

26:54.269 --> 26:56.950
propellers to navigate down the eight

26:56.950 --> 27:00.100
foot wide portion of 10x and then

27:00.100 --> 27:03.480
through the narrow 27-inch section all

27:03.480 --> 27:07.620
the way to the bottom this is exciting

27:07.620 --> 27:11.909
let's do this hey yeah I'm good to go

27:11.909 --> 27:12.909
okay

27:12.909 --> 27:16.900
let's put her in we haven't had ROV data

27:16.900 --> 27:18.909
in the past this will be the first

27:18.909 --> 27:21.090
remote operated vehicle in the cavern

27:21.090 --> 27:23.210
we're gonna get a state-of-the-art

27:23.210 --> 27:25.970
machine in there and let it tell us what

27:25.970 --> 27:28.409
it can tell us just the boat you've gone

27:28.409 --> 27:30.010
it's an order

27:30.010 --> 27:33.970
I suppose though in the water down

27:33.970 --> 27:38.279
lights on okay

27:38.279 --> 27:43.590
from our standpoint we'd like to see

27:43.590 --> 27:46.809
some distinctly man-made artifacts in

27:46.809 --> 27:48.100
there heck we'd like to see a treasure

27:48.100 --> 27:50.059
chest in there dan thinks there's one in

27:50.059 --> 27:53.929
there we'd love to see it that's pretty

27:53.929 --> 27:56.240
good visibility yeah it's a lot better

27:56.240 --> 27:58.690
than I thought it was gonna be standing

27:58.690 --> 27:59.690
platform

27:59.690 --> 28:02.369
1:32 yep going around

28:02.369 --> 28:08.970
we're out 150 in here keep going down

28:08.970 --> 28:11.120
alright well there's some debris

28:11.120 --> 28:18.519
it's 181 old better let's stop there all

28:18.519 --> 28:21.419
right take a look see

28:21.419 --> 28:24.559
Walter debris down here there seem to be

28:24.559 --> 28:26.899
a lot of boards going across or steel or

28:26.899 --> 28:29.210
hey won't you look directly down

28:29.210 --> 28:38.690
that's a 27-inch yeah that's it right

28:38.690 --> 28:39.690
there

28:39.690 --> 28:40.690
that Kermit that's what I'm thinking

28:40.690 --> 28:41.690
yeah good turn right here yeah that's

28:41.690 --> 28:43.129
the twenty seventy right on top of it

28:43.129 --> 28:45.149
there is that do your figure that's the

28:45.149 --> 28:48.299
edge of the hole there that tight space

28:48.299 --> 28:54.330
I'll just put it in there okay here we

28:54.330 --> 28:59.159
go here we go

28:59.159 --> 29:02.240
given Dan's belief and stories about the

29:02.240 --> 29:04.831
whole and our expectations I think we

29:04.831 --> 29:06.639
both have expectations that we're gonna

29:06.639 --> 29:09.730
see man-made objects down below where

29:09.730 --> 29:16.179
we're in the 27-inch right now is wait

29:16.179 --> 29:19.200
what's that that's metal for sure what

29:19.200 --> 29:23.549
is that though is that a droplet is that

29:23.549 --> 29:24.960
the drill bar David is that the drill

29:24.960 --> 29:29.350
bar looks like in the 1970s when Oak

29:29.350 --> 29:32.200
Island resident and treasure hunter dan

29:32.200 --> 29:34.990
Blankenship was digging 10x a member of

29:34.990 --> 29:37.610
his crew dropped an approximately 20

29:37.610 --> 29:41.169
foot long drill bar down the 235 foot

29:41.169 --> 29:42.980
board

29:42.980 --> 29:45.460
despite many attempts to retrieve it the

29:45.460 --> 29:47.629
drill bar was never found

29:47.629 --> 29:49.629
and opinions had varied on where it

29:49.629 --> 29:52.299
could be and many believe it could be

29:52.299 --> 29:56.020
lodged in the 27-inch Y hole but no one

29:56.020 --> 29:58.470
has tried to enter the cavity since the

29:58.470 --> 30:01.610
bar was dropped if it turns out that the

30:01.610 --> 30:04.700
drill bar is blocking the narrow shaft

30:04.700 --> 30:07.480
and cannot be removed it would end any

30:07.480 --> 30:09.750
notion of sending a diver down to

30:09.750 --> 30:12.210
explore the mysterious underground

30:12.210 --> 30:15.080
chamber the drill bar is just such a

30:15.080 --> 30:17.080
complicating factor for this whole thing

30:17.080 --> 30:19.779
because it's bad enough we got a 27-inch

30:19.779 --> 30:21.950
hole we have a drill bar which is

30:21.950 --> 30:24.580
basically a four inch piece of more or

30:24.580 --> 30:27.110
less solid steel 20 some feet long

30:27.110 --> 30:31.159
wedged in there

30:31.159 --> 30:33.190
so it's off to the side right it's not

30:33.190 --> 30:36.659
in it's not in his way it could be

30:36.659 --> 30:44.230
no I think we're in the cavern now we're

30:44.230 --> 30:47.940
in the cavity this is a big open space

30:47.940 --> 30:50.409
what's that

30:50.409 --> 30:52.879
there's something

30:52.879 --> 30:59.059
something there's some right there

30:59.059 --> 31:05.910
that looks pretty straight yeah three

31:05.910 --> 31:09.610
square it's pretty squared I mean there

31:09.610 --> 31:12.220
could be your public prick over the post

31:12.220 --> 31:24.679
and could be the pouch

31:24.679 --> 31:26.840
there could be a boat wreck over the

31:26.840 --> 31:33.990
post at 10x an ROV in the two hundred

31:33.990 --> 31:36.410
and thirty five foot deep chamber has

31:36.410 --> 31:38.530
just revealed something of potential

31:38.530 --> 31:41.480
significance to Rick and Marty lagina

31:41.480 --> 31:44.539
and members of their team the image of

31:44.539 --> 31:51.730
what could be a man-made wooden post

31:51.730 --> 31:55.289
that's metal for sure there is also a

31:55.289 --> 31:57.950
second vertical structure which appears

31:57.950 --> 32:00.739
to be an old metal drill pipe can you

32:00.739 --> 32:03.523
follow that up yep what is that that's a

32:03.523 --> 32:06.110
piece of pipe coming out from the roof

32:06.110 --> 32:08.080
of the caverns at the top yep yep

32:08.080 --> 32:11.019
Wow was that a clear image there very

32:11.019 --> 32:13.640
distinctly two posts or columns and

32:13.640 --> 32:15.990
certainly they didn't grow there and I

32:15.990 --> 32:17.570
thought that they were almost certainly

32:17.570 --> 32:19.690
pipes Rick is convinced they're not

32:19.690 --> 32:22.290
pipes so that's another mystery we have

32:22.290 --> 32:24.669
to pull those things out and see whether

32:24.669 --> 32:26.620
those are our posts are on if they're

32:26.620 --> 32:28.900
wooden and appear to be placed there

32:28.900 --> 32:31.779
without coming down that 27-inch hole

32:31.779 --> 32:33.510
well then that's irrefutable proof of

32:33.510 --> 32:36.350
workings there there it is on this sonar

32:36.350 --> 32:40.470
yep well if there's indication that that

32:40.470 --> 32:43.070
post goes up into the ceiling and it's

32:43.070 --> 32:44.409
embedded in there well then that's

32:44.409 --> 32:46.659
indicative of the first real thing

32:46.659 --> 32:48.289
that's reinforces that there's any

32:48.289 --> 32:52.450
man-made Association down there

32:52.450 --> 32:54.740
it looks square yeah it definitely looks

32:54.740 --> 32:58.470
square suddenly the post like object and

32:58.470 --> 33:01.470
the metal drill pipe disappear from view

33:01.470 --> 33:04.059
we've lost the post

33:04.059 --> 33:09.389
okay go find it again where's our posts

33:09.389 --> 33:11.830
I don't know why it's so hard to see I

33:11.830 --> 33:14.159
mean it was so obvious where I'm sitting

33:14.159 --> 33:15.950
according to this owner the post should

33:15.950 --> 33:18.440
be just off to my left right right how

33:18.440 --> 33:19.730
come they're not showing up yeah I don't

33:19.730 --> 33:24.149
know they'd have to be pretty proud like

33:24.149 --> 33:26.739
all the way top to Bob they were yeah

33:26.739 --> 33:29.500
they were in this owner unless we pulled

33:29.500 --> 33:31.139
that pipe and that's all there was

33:31.139 --> 33:32.590
well it can't be we didn't that's not in

33:32.590 --> 33:34.629
the cavity no no we pulled that

33:34.629 --> 33:41.330
eight-inch that was in there could be a

33:41.330 --> 33:43.919
few weeks ago the team removed three

33:43.919 --> 33:47.580
rusted riser pipes out of 10x is it

33:47.580 --> 33:49.789
possible that the two posts they saw in

33:49.789 --> 33:54.499
the cavern were simply old riser pipes

33:54.499 --> 33:56.999
if that's true then why did one look

33:56.999 --> 34:00.779
square and even more curiously where did

34:00.779 --> 34:02.009
they go

34:02.009 --> 34:06.909
Daniel come on and set eyes in your

34:06.909 --> 34:07.909
cavern

34:07.909 --> 34:11.270
for 92 year old dan blankenship the man

34:11.270 --> 34:14.079
who constructed 10x with the help of his

34:14.079 --> 34:17.020
son Dave and friend dan henskee today's

34:17.020 --> 34:20.710
activities mean more to him than anyone

34:20.710 --> 34:26.359
I know you don't want to but I insist

34:26.359 --> 34:28.629
because for him finding something of

34:28.629 --> 34:31.929
value at the bottom of the 235-foot

34:31.929 --> 34:34.860
borehole would serve as a validation for

34:34.860 --> 34:37.730
his more than 50 years of dedication and

34:37.730 --> 34:40.879
hard work trying to solve the Oak Island

34:40.879 --> 34:43.149
mystery

34:43.149 --> 34:45.150
any certainty of things that tunnels

34:45.150 --> 34:47.089
have you seen anything that makes you

34:47.089 --> 34:49.040
think those are there not yet if I've

34:49.040 --> 34:52.409
headed towards them with the sonar and

34:52.409 --> 34:53.690
it always just seems to end up in the

34:53.690 --> 34:56.099
corner big key is to find it on the

34:56.099 --> 34:58.670
sonar and then ya swim towards it right

34:58.670 --> 35:03.549
out of time what's that can you go in

35:03.549 --> 35:04.690
there

35:04.690 --> 35:09.069
there's a wall though tunnels it's

35:09.069 --> 35:11.140
impossible to be a man-made no no

35:11.140 --> 35:12.720
question about that they come through

35:12.720 --> 35:13.720
the fissures in the rock

35:13.720 --> 35:15.030
absolutely they didn't come from the

35:15.030 --> 35:18.460
surface we see openings here right like

35:18.460 --> 35:21.109
right there now I'll turn and go towards

35:21.109 --> 35:22.109
I

35:22.109 --> 35:25.849
it kind of looks like a defined tunnel

35:25.849 --> 35:28.799
heading off right now that's a wall

35:28.799 --> 35:33.250
again I don't see anything that makes it

35:33.250 --> 35:35.140
seem like it's a man-made structure down

35:35.140 --> 35:37.390
there so far aside from maybe a little

35:37.390 --> 35:38.960
bit of concrete over port looks like a

35:38.960 --> 35:40.660
natural cavern that's been scoured

35:40.660 --> 35:42.880
that's probably gonna be it for the day

35:42.880 --> 35:45.930
then isn't it I would say so the ROV

35:45.930 --> 35:47.670
results were you know I hate to keep

35:47.670 --> 35:49.099
using the word disappointing because

35:49.099 --> 35:50.619
it's probably the wrong word they are

35:50.619 --> 35:53.721
what they are the driver of the ROV did

35:53.721 --> 35:55.890
bounce it off all the walls best he

35:55.890 --> 36:00.290
could well you think Brett so our

36:00.290 --> 36:03.440
purpose in this is to kind of ascertain

36:03.440 --> 36:05.270
whether there's anything down there

36:05.270 --> 36:08.190
between me and you that's been my quest

36:08.190 --> 36:10.359
for the last 10 years I would love to

36:10.359 --> 36:12.650
find something on this island that

36:12.650 --> 36:15.950
definitively says that there were

36:15.950 --> 36:19.020
man-made workings underground prior to

36:19.020 --> 36:20.780
1790 yeah that's what I've been looking

36:20.780 --> 36:23.869
for for 10 years potentially a wood post

36:23.869 --> 36:25.549
which we haven't seem to be able to

36:25.549 --> 36:27.310
locate potentially yeah

36:27.310 --> 36:29.540
nothing's indicating it so far that

36:29.540 --> 36:31.920
we've seen here so

36:31.920 --> 36:36.470
how does that impact you the bread I

36:36.470 --> 36:42.000
wouldn't put anybody in the water here

36:42.000 --> 36:53.079
so let's see what Big Brother's doing

36:53.079 --> 36:56.290
over here what started out as a simple

36:56.290 --> 36:59.440
operation to confirm information about

36:59.440 --> 37:02.220
10x has suddenly brought the entire Oak

37:02.220 --> 37:05.260
Island treasure hunt to a standstill

37:05.260 --> 37:08.200
because diver Brad Stabenow did not see

37:08.200 --> 37:10.300
any evidence of man-made tunnels or

37:10.300 --> 37:13.420
structures at the bottom of 10x he has

37:13.420 --> 37:15.839
informed Rick and Marty that there is no

37:15.839 --> 37:18.220
reason for him to make such an expensive

37:18.220 --> 37:22.010
and potentially deadly dive but Brad

37:22.010 --> 37:23.859
felt that there was an insufficient data

37:23.859 --> 37:26.609
revealed to warn a dive and I kind of

37:26.609 --> 37:29.200
felt that way too I had said but my

37:29.200 --> 37:31.630
feeling is that what I saw today does

37:31.630 --> 37:33.490
not warrant putting a human being down

37:33.490 --> 37:35.580
there what do you guys think there's

37:35.580 --> 37:37.319
nothing I could get excited about that's

37:37.319 --> 37:40.160
for sure well we didn't see the floor

37:40.160 --> 37:42.220
you can't make that statement he ran

37:42.220 --> 37:44.680
into the wall everywhere he went

37:44.680 --> 37:46.549
and the rover I mean it water kept

37:46.549 --> 37:48.549
getting clear clear this is a problem

37:48.549 --> 37:50.550
obviously but I just I don't see risk in

37:50.550 --> 37:52.619
a human life to get on there right now I

37:52.619 --> 37:57.569
don't

37:57.569 --> 38:00.240
died sad in a sense but I'm saying I'm

38:00.240 --> 38:02.850
seeing 10x off the list that's what I'm

38:02.850 --> 38:06.200
seeing I didn't see enough to say cross

38:06.200 --> 38:09.460
it off to me the answer is not

38:09.460 --> 38:11.450
definitive as that was always the

38:11.450 --> 38:13.760
criteria it's never gonna be definitive

38:13.760 --> 38:16.049
you can always make up some plan you

38:16.049 --> 38:18.020
know I disagree I think what's gonna

38:18.020 --> 38:20.599
have to happen is what I said was gonna

38:20.599 --> 38:22.550
have to happen long ago or is gonna have

38:22.550 --> 38:25.099
to be humanized in that cavity I think

38:25.099 --> 38:26.559
we should get David in on the

38:26.559 --> 38:28.579
conversation too I would be fine with me

38:28.579 --> 38:34.390
David what we're debating what we should

38:34.390 --> 38:36.819
do next with 10 acts what you see that's

38:36.819 --> 38:41.640
just it not what we expected to see you

38:41.640 --> 38:43.890
willing to cross this off I don't know

38:43.890 --> 38:48.549
Rick I really don't know could the ROV

38:48.549 --> 38:51.150
data be enough to convince the team that

38:51.150 --> 38:53.230
the search for what might be at the

38:53.230 --> 38:57.359
bottom of 10x should now be abandoned

38:57.359 --> 38:59.369
I'm close to crossing it off because

38:59.369 --> 39:00.589
where are the tunnels they're not under

39:00.589 --> 39:03.980
sediment where were the tunnels you

39:03.980 --> 39:05.220
absolutely convinced there were no

39:05.220 --> 39:07.369
tunnels

39:07.369 --> 39:09.460
I don't know we can see the column we

39:09.460 --> 39:10.810
didn't see the tunnels we didn't see the

39:10.810 --> 39:14.550
chests we didn't see any story you know

39:14.550 --> 39:18.740
he's anybody's when it's anybody's from

39:18.740 --> 39:22.309
my perspective I seem to see that it was

39:22.309 --> 39:25.059
basically showing the same area in the

39:25.059 --> 39:27.319
cavity all the time

39:27.319 --> 39:29.030
and I never saw the floor or very rarely

39:29.030 --> 39:31.369
saw the floor I think it was an

39:31.369 --> 39:33.980
incomplete study if you will the data

39:33.980 --> 39:36.270
was insufficient surely it's sufficient

39:36.270 --> 39:39.920
for me to say we're done here

39:39.920 --> 39:42.470
we're all saying we've postponed the

39:42.470 --> 39:45.920
dive at least that's it for me and I'm

39:45.920 --> 39:48.580
really close to putting an X in 10x and

39:48.580 --> 39:50.990
saying we did our job that's wrong I

39:50.990 --> 39:53.070
know I'm not there Larry said we have a

39:53.070 --> 39:54.680
disagreement I'm not there I'm not

39:54.680 --> 39:56.730
willing to do what he's willing to do

39:56.730 --> 39:58.970
put an action through that shaft

39:58.970 --> 40:04.991
I'm not 10x X I'm not I'm close we have

40:04.991 --> 40:07.720
a disagreement we'll work it off exactly

40:07.720 --> 40:10.010
I come as far as we can today let's call

40:10.010 --> 40:11.010
it a day

40:11.010 --> 40:12.490
what say you I say the operative word is

40:12.490 --> 40:16.010
today I am not finished with 10x he's

40:16.010 --> 40:17.420
never varied from where he's been I've

40:17.420 --> 40:18.930
never buried from where I've been which

40:18.930 --> 40:22.630
is show me concrete evidence of human

40:22.630 --> 40:26.590
activity pre 1795 and then my my

40:26.590 --> 40:29.300
enthusiasm level goes way up but it's

40:29.300 --> 40:32.299
his passion and part of my

40:32.299 --> 40:36.230
decision-making process involves what

40:36.230 --> 40:39.440
matters to him you know Rick Mathers

40:39.440 --> 40:40.990
but with Brad out of the picture we're

40:40.990 --> 40:44.569
looking for a new diver

40:44.569 --> 40:46.799
for Rick and Marty lagina and their

40:46.799 --> 40:49.940
partners the Oak Island mystery remains

40:49.940 --> 40:52.849
just as complex today as it did when it

40:52.849 --> 40:57.470
began in 220 years ago although they

40:57.470 --> 40:59.180
continue to make progress at the money

40:59.180 --> 41:02.780
pit they have for now had a major

41:02.780 --> 41:05.890
setback and getting to the bottom of 10x

41:05.890 --> 41:09.369
but will bringing in a new diver helped

41:09.369 --> 41:11.430
the team get the answers they're looking

41:11.430 --> 41:14.720
for will it force them to turn their

41:14.720 --> 41:17.819
attentions back to the money pit the

41:17.819 --> 41:22.069
swamp or other even less likely places

41:22.069 --> 41:26.619
on the island or a mysterious treasure

41:26.619 --> 41:31.289
may lie hiding next time on the curse of

41:31.289 --> 41:32.289
Oak Island

41:32.289 --> 41:35.839
that famous stone is it on the island it

41:35.839 --> 41:37.910
was in concrete when I saw if these are

41:37.910 --> 41:39.619
part of a bigger puzzle we've got three

41:39.619 --> 41:43.099
new pieces let's see what we found here

41:43.099 --> 41:46.190
an X right Wow these two pieces seem to

41:46.190 --> 41:47.830
be part of the same stone well you could

41:47.830 --> 41:49.910
probably smash them right up what we

41:49.910 --> 41:51.550
gonna find when we drill these holes the

41:51.550 --> 41:53.710
chambers were the real treasures hit he

41:53.710 --> 41:56.190
put an X on the spot this was to work at

41:56.190 --> 41:57.270
the Aztec empire
