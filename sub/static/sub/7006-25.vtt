WEBVTT

00:04.871 --> 00:08.432
Well, l'd better get going.
lt was great studying with you, Randy.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.008
Yeah.

00:10.076 --> 00:13.739
Um... hey, Lauren?
lsn't your birthday this Friday?

00:15.081 --> 00:16.309
You remembered.

00:16.383 --> 00:19.511
Well, yeah. l always remember
the most important birthdays.

00:19.586 --> 00:22.054
You know, Washington, Lincoln, Lauren.

00:23.123 --> 00:26.684
Anyway, l was thinking we'd get
some friends together and celebrate.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.655
Actually, you know what l'd really like?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.731
lf somebody asked me out to dinner.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.800
Oh, yeah? Anyone in particular?

00:37.437 --> 00:39.462
Yes.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.007
Someone in the tri-state area?

00:42.575 --> 00:44.509
l'm talking about you.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.045
Well, Lauren, l'd love to
take you out to dinner.

00:47.113 --> 00:49.547
But wouldn't that, you know,
be kind of a...

00:49.616 --> 00:52.710
- Date?
- Yeah. That's what it sounded like.

00:52.786 --> 00:56.153
But you didn't mean it like that.
Did you mean it like that?

00:56.256 --> 00:58.156
l did. Unless, you don't want to.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.455
Oh, no, no, no. l'd love to go
on a date, unless you don't want to.

01:01.528 --> 01:04.257
- Randy, l asked you.
- Oh, yeah.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.031
- OK, then!
- OK!

01:08.134 --> 01:10.102
So, uh, then we're going on a date.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.933
- Yeah, it's a date.
- Me and you.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.769
- Us.
- Together.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.739
l guess this takes us
to a whole new level.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.904
Yeah. l guess it does.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.744
- Well, good-bye. l'll see you tomorrow.
- OK. Bye.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.749
Mom, you are not gonna believe it.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.988
Lauren and l are finally
going out on a date.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.120
- Congratulations!
- Yes.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.427
This brings us
to a whole new level.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.626
By the way, what does that mean?

01:43.002 --> 01:46.267
That you're about to enter a more
mature, evolved relationship

01:46.339 --> 01:48.102
based on trust and communication.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.506
You'll have to be constantly in tune

01:50.577 --> 01:53.410
with Lauren's innermost feelings.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.381
[grunting] Oh, miss the old level.

02:46.065 --> 02:48.533
- We have time for one more letter.
- Here you are.

02:48.601 --> 02:52.765
A big one. This one is from
a Katie Allen,

02:52.872 --> 02:55.705
one of our younger viewers,
look at that,

02:55.775 --> 02:58.869
- a little picture for us.
- [audience] Oh.

02:58.945 --> 03:00.970
<i>A little Tool Time bench.
There's me...</i>

03:01.047 --> 03:03.515
...after a weekend in Cancun, evidently.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.614
There's Al. Heidi's carrying
a chainsaw backstage.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.655
- Thank you, very nice.
- [Heidi] Cute.

03:09.722 --> 03:12.213
Well, Katie, you're a very
talented artist.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.261
Artist? She's a magician.
Look how thin she made you look.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.693
Oh, now, come on, man!

03:17.764 --> 03:20.858
<i>That's all the time we have.
See you next time on Tool Time.</i>

03:20.934 --> 03:23.960
[audience applauds, cheers]

03:30.109 --> 03:32.236
- We're clear.
- Thank you, Shawn.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.872
You've been a great audience.
Thanks for coming.

03:34.981 --> 03:38.439
We got free gifts on the way out.
Styrofoam cowboy hats for the gals

03:38.518 --> 03:43.012
and little... bottles of travel-size
Prell for the guys. Thanks very much.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.119
Does everybody know
what time it is?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.660
[shouts]

03:48.728 --> 03:50.696
- Hey!
- Lisa!

03:50.797 --> 03:52.822
- Hi!
- Look at you!

03:53.233 --> 03:55.531
Holy smokes!

03:55.602 --> 03:57.263
- Well...
- Well...

03:57.337 --> 04:00.033
l haven't talked to you in
a long time. You look great!

04:00.106 --> 04:02.199
So do you. Something's different.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.334
- No bandages.
- That's it.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.610
How's school going?

04:06.713 --> 04:08.647
l got my paramedics certificate.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.740
- Really?
- [both] Congratulations!

04:10.817 --> 04:12.842
Thanks. l'm looking for a job.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.978
- Heidi! How are you?
- Hi.

04:15.054 --> 04:17.921
- Great. Good to see you.
- Congratulations on the baby.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.755
Thanks. l had a little girl, Amy.
Here's a picture.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.555
- Oh, she's so cute!
- Thank you.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.097
lf you're here this weekend,
do the show Friday.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.462
Come as a guest,
we're building the hot rod.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.296
lf you're sure, l would love to.

04:29.402 --> 04:33.361
- lt would be terrific! Yes!
- Sounds like a lot of fun.

04:33.473 --> 04:36.033
Why don't we go to Big Mike's
and catch up? All right?

04:36.142 --> 04:39.009
- Yeah!
- l gotta pick up Amy from the sitter's.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.239
You guys go. Have a good time.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.172
<i>You're gonna miss some
great Tool Time stories.</i>

04:44.250 --> 04:45.217
Yeah, well...

04:45.318 --> 04:47.684
Remember when Tim nailed
his foot to the floor?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.153
Remember when he glued
his head to the table?

04:50.857 --> 04:54.315
Wait, remember the time we put
Super Glue in one of his sandwiches?

04:54.394 --> 04:57.261
- Oh, yeah. That was funny.
- You did that?

04:57.330 --> 04:59.855
- He told me it was mayonnaise.
- l didn't say that.

04:59.932 --> 05:03.368
- And you believed him?
- You always believe the boss. Come on!

05:07.874 --> 05:10.138
- Hey.
- Hi. How was school?

05:10.209 --> 05:11.972
Oh, awful.

05:12.078 --> 05:15.514
Now that Lauren and l are going
on this date, everything's changed.

05:15.581 --> 05:16.548
What do you mean?

05:16.649 --> 05:20.745
l didn't know how to act when l saw her,
if l should give a normal ''hi,''

05:20.820 --> 05:23.254
or a more caring, emotional ''hi.''

05:24.023 --> 05:26.355
During lunch she asked me
to pass the ketchup.

05:26.426 --> 05:29.156
- So?
- Mom, she was eating French fries.

05:29.228 --> 05:32.129
l should've anticipated her needs.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.224
Honey, just relax.
You're gonna be fine.

05:35.935 --> 05:37.766
l hope so.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.329
So, Mom, what kind of food did Dad
take you for on your first date?

05:41.407 --> 05:45.343
ltalian. Meatball subs in
the Sears parking lot.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.605
l think Lauren might
prefer something indoors.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.377
[laughs] Yeah.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.042
- Jill?
- [Jill] Yeah?

05:54.120 --> 05:58.489
<i>Big news. Friday's show, the Tool Time
audience is in for a big treat.</i>

05:58.591 --> 06:00.957
You're being pre-empted.

06:01.561 --> 06:03.620
Another feeble stab at humor, funny.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.722
No. First off, Lisa's coming back.
And second of all...

06:06.799 --> 06:09.734
- Your old tool girl.
- That's not all. We're gonna have...

06:09.802 --> 06:12.236
- Heidi still there?
- That's not the best part.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.603
Two tool girls?

06:16.275 --> 06:20.439
Yes, Brad! But the best part
is the hot rod got primered in time.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.912
We're gonna showcase it on the show.

06:22.982 --> 06:26.247
Which do you think the audience
is gonna be more excited about,

06:26.319 --> 06:29.686
your primered car or the two tool girls?

06:30.656 --> 06:33.784
<i>Come on! Tool Time, guys watching...
The primered hot rod.</i>

06:35.628 --> 06:37.755
You are so sweet.

06:37.830 --> 06:41.197
l love that you rather look at cars
than beautiful women.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.328
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.461
- You know what that also means?
- What?

06:45.538 --> 06:48.871
l'd leave you in a second
if l met the right Corvette.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.270
- [tires screeching]
- [band plays intro]

06:53.346 --> 06:55.712
<i>Hi. Welcome back to Tool Time
and our salute...</i>

06:55.815 --> 06:58.181
[muffled engine revving]

06:58.251 --> 06:59.878
[audience laughs]

07:05.258 --> 07:08.022
Well, it's either a salute
to bean dip...

07:08.694 --> 07:10.958
...or to custom cars.

07:11.030 --> 07:14.363
And next up we have a very
special guest helping us out today.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.459
l'm so excited that l'm not gonna wait.

07:16.536 --> 07:19.596
Heidi, bring out our
original tool girl, please.

07:19.672 --> 07:21.230
Here you are, Tim.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.274
[audience applauds, cheers]

07:28.414 --> 07:30.644
As you all know,
Lisa has been off at school

07:30.716 --> 07:34.049
studying to be an emergency
medical technician.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.213
You've certainly come
to the right show.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.925
All right, enough chitchat.
We have a job to do.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.460
ln Lisa's honor,
she will help channel this hood

07:42.528 --> 07:44.428
on this '46 Ford convertible.

07:44.497 --> 07:48.866
The first step is to tack-weld the hood
down securely before we make our cut.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.993
- Heidi, could...
- l'd be happy to weld.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.368
Could you help Lisa
with her coat, please?

07:53.439 --> 07:54.963
Oh. OK.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.906
[rapping on hood]

08:00.880 --> 08:02.711
What are you doing?

08:02.782 --> 08:05.410
l'm just doing a little
''rapping in the hood.''

08:05.685 --> 08:09.985
[audience laughs]

08:10.056 --> 08:14.220
Lisa, why don't you tell us what
you'll be using to do your tack welds?

08:14.327 --> 08:18.229
- l'll be using a MlG welder.
- [grunting] Oh, l love MlG welders.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.561
Tim, let go. Let go.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.464
Tim, release.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.567
Do you want me to tape that section
on the other side of?

08:26.639 --> 08:30.006
- Got it all covered. Thanks, Heidi.
- [Lisa] Fire in the hold!

08:31.077 --> 08:33.409
[whirring]

08:34.547 --> 08:37.277
Boy, she's really
doing a good job over there!

08:37.350 --> 08:40.011
- Ow!
- l'll get the first-aid kit!

08:40.086 --> 08:42.782
Don't worry, Heidi.
l came prepared.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.292
lt's OK, everybody.
lt's just a surface abrasion.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.331
Just a surface abrasion. lt's OK.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.798
This is great. A tool girl that
knows how to administer first aid.

08:55.902 --> 08:59.269
- Pretty impressive, huh? Huh?
- [audience cheers, applauds]

09:04.777 --> 09:06.745
Nice.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.141
ls that Lauren's birthday gift?

09:09.215 --> 09:12.378
Yeah. l got her a really nice pen,
engraved with her initials.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.352
A pen? And you want to be her boyfriend?

09:16.255 --> 09:18.519
What would you know
about impressing a girl?

09:18.591 --> 09:21.355
l know it doesn't
involve office supplies.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.560
Randy, don't listen to him.
l think it's a great idea.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.800
- Hi, everybody.
- [all] Hi.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.064
<i>So, did anybody see Tool Time today?</i>

09:32.171 --> 09:35.334
<i>l did. And it was
the best Tool Time ever.</i>

09:36.442 --> 09:39.411
So, when are you gonna
get a third tool girl?

09:39.512 --> 09:43.414
l'm not going to. But l told Lisa
she's welcome back anytime she wants.

09:43.482 --> 09:47.213
- All right.
- ls Heidi OK with that?

09:47.286 --> 09:49.652
Sure. Why wouldn't she be?

09:49.755 --> 09:53.589
And besides that, l got a lot of cool
ways of working Lisa back into the show.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.627
- All right.
- [telephone rings]

09:59.398 --> 10:01.229
Hello? Hi, Heidi.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.632
We were just talking about you.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.373
What? Say that again.

10:08.474 --> 10:09.805
Come on.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.510
Not fulfilling enough?

10:12.578 --> 10:13.738
We should talk.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.644
Just...

10:15.715 --> 10:19.674
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This has something to do with... Heidi?

10:20.820 --> 10:23.084
- What's going on?
- She quit.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.651
<i>l can't believe she won't
be on Tool Time anymore.</i>

10:26.726 --> 10:29.786
- Tim, what did you do?
- Nothing.

10:31.197 --> 10:34.758
Nothing? You just took away
my reason for living.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.033
l can't believe she wants
to quit the show.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.507
<i>That's like abandoning
the Tool Time family.</i>

10:44.577 --> 10:47.910
Well, it might have something
to do with her ''step-sister.''

10:48.848 --> 10:50.816
Al?

10:52.251 --> 10:55.948
l'm talking about Lisa.
Did you ask Heidi how she felt

10:56.022 --> 10:58.923
about Lisa coming back
to the show whenever she wants?

10:58.991 --> 11:01.551
As a matter of fact... no.

11:02.795 --> 11:06.697
Did you make sure that you
didn't feature Lisa on the show

11:06.766 --> 11:08.529
any more than you featured Heidi?

11:08.634 --> 11:11.125
As l recall... no.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.896
Did you, at any time, tell Heidi

11:14.974 --> 11:20.139
that Lisa coming back on the show
was in no way a threat to her job?

11:20.246 --> 11:23.272
l'll have to go... with ''no.''

11:25.017 --> 11:27.383
Do you see a pattern here?

11:30.823 --> 11:32.381
No.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.352
What would happen if Binford

11:35.428 --> 11:39.990
<i>asked Bob Vila to come and co-host
Tool Time whenever he felt like it?</i>

11:40.099 --> 11:43.626
l'd probably hit him in the head
with a board like l did last time.

11:44.036 --> 11:48.063
Binford would never do that because they
know it would make you uncomfortable.

11:48.140 --> 11:52.702
lt must be nice knowing
that your job is so secure!

11:52.778 --> 11:54.871
All right, already.

11:54.947 --> 11:57.814
l'll call Heidi up
and unravel this mess.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.413
How do l look? ls this a good
first date outfit? l could change.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.546
lt's perfect! You look great.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.887
She's not picking up.
l know you're there, Heidi. Pick up.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.291
She's not picking up. Heidi!

12:11.197 --> 12:13.757
Why is it women get
so emotional over everything?

12:13.833 --> 12:16.666
l'll tell you, because they're
high-strung and moody!

12:16.736 --> 12:20.297
No matter what you do, it's never
enough! You're never right! Never!

12:22.508 --> 12:24.738
Enjoy your date tonight.

12:29.215 --> 12:33.311
You know, l am so sorry. The salesman
told me it was a high-quality pen.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.512
Oh, don't worry about it, Randy.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.753
The ink actually matches my skirt.

12:40.826 --> 12:45.388
<i>Good evening. Our special pasta
tonight is Linguine al Arrabbiata.</i>

12:45.464 --> 12:48.922
- Ah, always good.
- What's Arrabbiata?

12:49.001 --> 12:51.060
Well, it's... it's sorta...

12:51.137 --> 12:55.471
Well, it's kinda tough to describe.
How would you put that into English?

12:55.541 --> 12:57.668
Sauce.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.269
Of course.

13:01.347 --> 13:04.111
While you decide,
can l bring you a soft drink?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.446
- No. l'll just have water.
- Me, too.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.544
Two waters.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.454
Big tip coming my way tonight.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.316
Uh... you know, Lauren,

13:15.394 --> 13:19.091
it's really great that we could have
our first date on your birthday.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.258
l hope l picked
the right restaurant.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.460
No. l love it.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.834
Are you OK? You seem a little tense.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.373
- l do? Why?
- You're buttering your hand.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.271
Dry skin.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.739
Here we are.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.373
Two free waters.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.552
- Well, heh, the water looks good.
- Yeah.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.314
- Here's to your birthday.
- [screams]

13:44.757 --> 13:47.783
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
- lt's OK. lt's OK.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.226
l'll just go to
the ladies room and dry off.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.796
OK.

13:54.066 --> 13:56.534
<i>Bona sera, Randito!</i>

14:06.879 --> 14:09.439
- Wilson?
- So what brings you here this evening?

14:09.548 --> 14:11.914
l'm on a date.
What are you doing here?

14:12.017 --> 14:15.145
Well, l'm getting together
with my wine-tasting club.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.052
Oh, yeah? Where is everyone else?

14:17.122 --> 14:20.489
Oh, they're probably at home,
sobering up from our last meeting.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.394
How is your date with Lauren going?

14:23.462 --> 14:26.329
Oh, well, so far
l've inked her, soaked her

14:26.398 --> 14:28.764
and, uh, buttered my own hand.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.632
- [laughs] Randy, everybody does that.
- Really?

14:31.737 --> 14:34.035
No. l'm just trying
to make you feel better.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.538
[sighs] Gosh, Wilson!

14:36.609 --> 14:39.578
l'm just worried that
Lauren's not gonna like this date.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.875
The more worried l get,
the more l screw up.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.848
- [Wilson repeats] Mm-hmm.
- [Randy sighs]

14:45.384 --> 14:50.151
You know, Randy, l'm reminded of
the modern-day guru, Baba Ram Dass.

14:50.256 --> 14:54.215
His philosophy is ''Be here now.''

14:55.127 --> 14:57.687
Well, l am here now.
l think that's the problem.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.890
[repeats] No.
What Baba Ram Dass means is

15:00.966 --> 15:05.926
be here in the moment, don't worry
about what will be, savor what is.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.768
Say what's on your mind.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.967
Well, what's on my mind is that
Lauren must think l'm a dork.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.204
l've seen the way Lauren looks at you.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.407
Her eyes definitely do not say ''dork.''

15:17.983 --> 15:20.713
- Really?
- Go to her, Randy.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.554
Well, l would,
but she's in the ladies room.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.689
Wait.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.599
Thanks a lot, Wilson.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.760
Hey, Randy. l'm back.

15:38.837 --> 15:41.499
Yes, you are. You're here now.

15:41.573 --> 15:45.805
And l'm here now. And now we can sit
in the candlelight and enjoy our water.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.975
l would like that.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.146
Are we ready to order?

15:53.218 --> 15:56.847
Or do we need another
few hours here at my best table?

15:57.890 --> 16:00.654
You know, excuse me, sir.
l don't mean to be impolite,

16:00.759 --> 16:03.455
but this is our first date.
We picked this restaurant

16:03.529 --> 16:06.464
is we were told we'd have
an enjoyable evening.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.501
l'm sorry.
l'm a little jumpy tonight.

16:09.568 --> 16:12.799
l always get that way when l have
to face this rowdy wine club.

16:13.539 --> 16:16.906
This one they call Wilson
is a real handful.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.212
<i>[Wilson] Signore! This Chianti is
an insult to my palate.</i>

16:21.313 --> 16:23.679
lt has no exuberance.

16:26.218 --> 16:29.654
Allow me to bring you some
complimentary appetizers.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.723
You know, Randy, that was
really great the way you spoke up.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.560
Well, sometimes you gotta stop
worrying about how someone might react

16:39.631 --> 16:42.566
and just say what's on your mind.

16:42.634 --> 16:46.263
You know, especially if you
really care about the person.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.603
l didn't know you had such
strong feelings about our waiter.

16:52.811 --> 16:56.474
No. Um... l'm talking about you.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.579
And...

16:59.651 --> 17:02.484
...what's on my mind
is how beautiful you look tonight.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.756
Thank you, Randy.

17:06.825 --> 17:10.761
You know, there's something
on my mind, too...

17:15.768 --> 17:18.896
Ah, never a dull moment at table seven.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.569
- Al!
- Hey, Lisa.

17:23.642 --> 17:28.204
Hey! Big news. You're looking at
Detroit Memorial's newest paramedic.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.339
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

17:30.416 --> 17:32.782
Boy, it didn't take you
long to find a job!

17:32.851 --> 17:36.878
They said three years with Tim was like
ten years' experience in emergency.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.022
- [Al] Ain't that the truth?
- Look who's back. Hi, Lisa. Hi, Al.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.958
- [Lisa] Hi.
- Hey, Tim! Guess what?

17:43.028 --> 17:45.895
Lisa found a job as
a paramedic at Detroit Memorial.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.898
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Tim.

17:47.966 --> 17:50.127
- Um... have you talked to Heidi?
- No.

17:50.202 --> 17:53.365
lt's her morning to come late.
She's at mommy-and-baby class.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.635
- Where is it? l want to talk to her.
- lt's at Saint Stephens.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.109
But l don't think they'll let you
in the door without your mommy.

18:02.214 --> 18:05.115
This is serious, Al. Heidi quit.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.979
- What?
- Yeah.

18:07.052 --> 18:08.986
We talked last night,
she was upset.

18:09.054 --> 18:12.023
And l think it's because
l had Lisa on the show again.

18:12.124 --> 18:15.093
Wait, you mean you never asked Heidi
how she felt about it?

18:15.194 --> 18:17.219
Oh, boy! Here we go again.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.524
l never would've come back
if l knew it would upset Heidi.

18:21.600 --> 18:26.128
l never asked her how she felt about it
either. How could l be so insensitive?

18:26.205 --> 18:29.140
Pull yourself together, will you?

18:29.208 --> 18:31.506
l'll go down there and
we'll work it out. OK?

18:31.577 --> 18:34.341
Don't start without me.
lf you have to, just stall.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.811
- See you later, Lisa.
- OK.

18:35.881 --> 18:39.783
What is becoming of Al Borland?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.218
l mean, is my sensitivity
being obliterated

18:42.287 --> 18:45.950
by my overwhelming masculinity?

18:46.024 --> 18:48.720
l don't think so, Al.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.658
<i># The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

18:52.731 --> 18:55.666
<i># Round and round
round and round</i>

18:55.734 --> 18:58.498
<i># The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

18:58.604 --> 19:01.164
<i># All through the town #</i>

19:01.273 --> 19:03.036
- [Gail laughs]
- [all cheer]

19:03.108 --> 19:05.668
Before we go on, does anybody
have any questions?

19:05.777 --> 19:10.077
l do. That bus you were singing about,
what kind of power plant?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.913
ls that a Cummings,
a Caterpillar or a Detroit Diesel?

19:13.018 --> 19:14.747
Tim, what are you doing here?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.254
Um... l need to talk to you.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.381
l'm right in the middle of my class.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.724
l want you to come back.

19:23.795 --> 19:27.458
Tim, l told you how l felt.
l have to move on.

19:27.533 --> 19:30.093
- [baby cries]
- But l need you.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.864
Oh... Heidi, give him another chance.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.405
He's making an effort.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.499
You're upset you had to share
your role with another woman.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.306
- Another woman?
- You pig!

19:40.379 --> 19:43.746
Wait, wait, wait!
l'm not her husband! l'm her boss.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.283
- Oh! Sexual harassment!
- [woman] Uh-huh.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.377
- No, no, no, no.
- Could we talk in private for a minute?

19:49.454 --> 19:52.423
Excuse me. Would you mind
watching Amy for a second?

19:52.491 --> 19:57.428
- Oh, l'd be happy to.
- l'll be right back.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.054
- All right...
- [baby cries]

19:59.131 --> 20:02.692
l shouldn't have invited Lisa on the
show without asking you about it.

20:02.768 --> 20:06.135
Tim, l wouldn't have minded
if l felt like my work was appreciated.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.571
Come on, l appreciate your work.
You know that.

20:08.674 --> 20:12.235
No, l don't.
You never say anything about it.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.472
<i>You're a very important part
of Tool Time.</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:17.174
You get there early every day,
set up the projects.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.184
You're the first one out front
with a fire extinguisher.

20:20.252 --> 20:24.951
<i>- Well, that's called self-defense.
- You're the biggest star on Tool Time.</i>

20:25.023 --> 20:27.548
Because of you,
we got fan clubs in six countries.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.356
Not to mention
20 federal penitentiaries.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.664
l'm sure they won't mind watching Lisa.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.168
- What does she have to do with this?
- Tim, l was there.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.569
- l heard her say she wanted a job.
- She wanted a job and got one.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.005
- As a paramedic.
- Really?

20:43.108 --> 20:47.374
Yeah. And just 'cause of that?
l would never fire you over that.

20:47.446 --> 20:51.143
<i>Think about it, Tool Time
won't be the same without you.</i>

20:51.216 --> 20:53.116
Well, l had better call Scott.

20:53.185 --> 20:57.121
- You guys should talk it over.
- No. He's watching Amy today.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.054
- l'm coming back to work.
- Really?

21:02.160 --> 21:03.127
See you later.

21:03.228 --> 21:07.324
Tim, you want to be Amy's partner?

21:07.399 --> 21:09.560
We're gonna sing a song.

21:09.668 --> 21:12.637
OK. How about a car song?

21:12.704 --> 21:15.229
<i>- Mustang Sally. How about that?
- [baby crying]</i>

21:15.307 --> 21:17.468
Actually, these songs
are for the babies.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.545
Well, you already
sang a song for the babies.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.012
<i># Itsy-bitsy spider</i>

21:23.081 --> 21:25.777
<i># Went up the water spout</i>

21:25.851 --> 21:27.614
<i># Down came the rain</i>

21:27.686 --> 21:30.450
<i># And washed the spider out</i>

21:30.522 --> 21:32.456
<i># Out came the sun</i>

21:32.524 --> 21:34.492
<i># And dried up all the rain</i>

21:34.559 --> 21:36.823
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:36.895 --> 21:40.023
Something came out here.
But it's certainly not the sun! Oh!

21:43.201 --> 21:46.830
l'm sure Heidi appreciated you
going to that baby-and-mommy class.

21:46.905 --> 21:50.341
What she appreciated was me
cleaning up that kid's mudslide.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.074
You changed a diaper?

21:53.145 --> 21:56.114
Yeah. Good thing l had
those welding gloves in the car.

21:57.182 --> 21:58.843
- [Randy] Hey.
- Hey, guys.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.441
Hi.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.886
Lauren and l are going
to my room to study for finals.

22:04.956 --> 22:07.618
They are so cute together.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.389
Remember how nervous you were
when we first went out?

22:10.462 --> 22:13.829
l tried to kiss you. l couldn't
figure out what to do with my hands.

22:13.899 --> 22:16.163
Yeah. You got over that quick.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.866
Remember when we studied
in your dorm room for finals?

22:19.938 --> 22:21.565
Oh, yeah.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.108
- One thing led to another and...
- Yeah.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.074
[both] Randy!
