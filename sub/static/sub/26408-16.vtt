WEBVTT

00:01.650 --> 00:03.641
Previously onSeaI Team...Oh, my God. I got in.

00:03.690 --> 00:04.736
Got in what?Tisch.

00:04.780 --> 00:05.860
Do they have history and math?No.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.787
Then it's not a school.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.736
Bye.

00:09.790 --> 00:13.430
You should go.
They'd be lucky to have you.

00:13.490 --> 00:15.788
What, you're stayinghere now? CLAY: Yeah, you know, I'm just

00:15.840 --> 00:17.319
trying to focus on the thing
that matters most in my life.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.271
Being a Navy SEAL.If that's the case,
then you got to

00:19.320 --> 00:20.833
come out tonight, meet Swanny.Brett Swann?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.050
Dude, that guy's
a legend, man.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.146
Why'd you get out?

00:23.190 --> 00:25.238
It was just my time.
My time to go.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.453
ANDRE:_
Are you feeling distance
between yourself and God, Ray?

00:27.500 --> 00:29.058
RAY:
Makes you wonder if
he's anywhere at all, hmm?

00:29.110 --> 00:30.498
ANDRE:
Maybe going through this
will bring you closer to him.

00:30.550 --> 00:32.506
Or maybe the
distance grows,

00:32.550 --> 00:34.541
and the only thing left
between me and God is space.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.899
DAVIS:
Look, I don't want to throw
our friendship away on a whim.

00:36.940 --> 00:38.726
I also don't want to spend
the rest of my life

00:38.770 --> 00:40.078
wondering "what if."

00:40.120 --> 00:41.371
Are-are you saying
what I think you're saying?

00:41.430 --> 00:43.466
DAVIS:
Hey, I got something to say.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.602
I got accepted to Officer
Candidate School.

00:45.650 --> 00:46.992
This was my last mission
with you.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.951
You're gonna make it.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.351
[birds chirping]

01:03.320 --> 01:05.925
Fuselage has
got to be close.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.378
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.
We passed Jaguar.

01:20.420 --> 01:21.682
ERIC:
Copy Bravo 2.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.948
Passing Jaguar.
Proceed with caution.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.120
Someone climbed out.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.126
Means we got a survivor
out there.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.479
Havoc, this is 1.
We got two dead.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.249
Looks like we got a survivor
left the trail.

01:34.310 --> 01:35.914
Bravo 1, you are clear

01:35.960 --> 01:37.131
to track down the survivor.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.135
Copy that.

01:38.180 --> 01:39.078
Brock. Get a scent.BROCK: Yep?

01:39.140 --> 01:40.391
Roger that. Check here.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.658
JASON:
Sonny. Clay.

01:42.710 --> 01:44.098
Go with him.Roger that.
BROCK: Find 'em.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.051
JASON:
Find the survivor.
We'll pull security.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.625
[barking, saw buzzing]

01:48.670 --> 01:51.138
RAY: J!JASON: Yeah?

01:51.190 --> 01:53.146
They already found us.
On the ridge.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.849
And they're marking
the plane with lidar.

01:54.890 --> 01:56.107
They're gonna
bomb the site.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.890
Copy that, Bravo 1.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.503
If this is Chinese Special
Forces, this will get ugly.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.108
Chinese soldier hasn't
fired on an American

02:03.160 --> 02:04.149
since the Korean War.

02:04.210 --> 02:05.552
That might change today.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.953
I was born on a river

02:21.010 --> 02:23.171
I was born on a boat... DAVIS: Mr. Quinn?

02:23.230 --> 02:24.834
Mm-hmm?About to have a
mutiny down there

02:24.880 --> 02:26.222
if you don't
serve up soon.

02:26.270 --> 02:29.000
The tri-tip wants what
the tri-tip wants. [chuckles]

02:29.060 --> 02:31.358
God, 12 weeks without
your barbecue?

02:31.410 --> 02:33.230
Yeah. _ _
I'm gonna miss It.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.976
That's not the only thing
you're gonna miss.

02:36.020 --> 02:39.069
[laughs]

02:39.110 --> 02:41.328
I'm gonna miss that
a little bit, I think.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.804
Yeah.
Not as much as
your barbecue.

02:43.850 --> 02:45.989
Yeah? Well, you know,
the time's gonna fly by.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.679
Don't you worry.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.206
So how do you know
when it's done?

02:51.250 --> 02:54.811
Well, here,
give me your hand.

02:54.870 --> 02:58.385
When the meat feels like
the-the skin between your thumb

02:58.430 --> 03:00.898
and "I'm mad at you" finger.
See here?

03:00.960 --> 03:04.043
Like that.
Yeah, touch the meat.

03:11.230 --> 03:12.743
[whispers]:
It's done.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.279
Let's go feed the wolves.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.793
[clears throat]

03:19.850 --> 03:20.885
[laughter, lively chatter]

03:20.930 --> 03:23.069
Thank God.
Sonny Quinn barbecue.

03:23.110 --> 03:24.281
It's to die for,
you know.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.490
Yeah, literally,
he almost died for it.

03:25.550 --> 03:27.199
SONNY [chuckles]:
Yeah.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.241
Never leave your dry rub recipe
in a sniper hide.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.723
He's not serious, is he?
Why?

03:30.770 --> 03:32.249
SONNY: _
Serious as sm.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.985
Yeah, when I had to
go back and get it,

03:34.030 --> 03:36.112
I had two dozen Jihad Johnnys
trying to light me up.

03:36.170 --> 03:37.467
You aren't gonna be
getting shot at

03:37.520 --> 03:39.169
on this deployment, right?Nah, look...

03:39.210 --> 03:40.768
Unfortunately,
probably not.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.697
All right, Uncle Clay,
have some mac and cheese.

03:42.740 --> 03:43.775
A little trigger happy
right now, okay?

03:43.830 --> 03:45.252
Everything's
gonna be fine.

03:45.310 --> 03:47.266
All we're gonna be doing
is training some Filipino SEALs.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.789
Yeah. Don't worry
about it, sweetheart.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.616
Philippines is not Afghanistan,
not even a little bit.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.218
Dirt, dirt, Gucci.

03:52.270 --> 03:53.783
You've been in the dirt twice,
now you get Gucci.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.569
And it's about
damn time.

03:55.620 --> 03:57.269
[chuckles]

03:58.150 --> 03:59.959
What's up?

04:00.020 --> 04:02.056
You hear about this cargo ship
off the coast of Japan?

04:02.110 --> 04:04.670
Yeah, you really need to work on
your party chitchat, Ellis.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.676
[chuckles]

04:06.720 --> 04:09.712
U.S. Naw ship collided with
a... a container ship,

04:09.770 --> 04:11.499
in the open ocean.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.279
Your people think
it's a cyber attack?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.069
Likely.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.293
Publicly it's an accident,
but Langley's on it.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.376
Keep me in the loop.

04:19.430 --> 04:22.422
I'm gonna grab a beer
before the boys kill it all.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.859
Hey, girl. You leaving?

04:26.910 --> 04:29.606
Yeah, they need a nap.
You stay.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.048
Tired?Mm-hmm.

04:31.090 --> 04:32.307
You sure?

04:32.350 --> 04:34.045
Yeah, you should see Davis off.

04:34.090 --> 04:35.398
I'm fine.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.261
Okay. Well, I love you.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.276
I will be home soon.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.312
You drinking whiskey now?

04:43.370 --> 04:46.237
Babe, it's a celebration. What?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.748
It's noon.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.323
Have some water, Ray.

04:50.370 --> 04:52.804
Come on, sweetie.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.336
What is going on with him?

05:04.390 --> 05:05.812
I don't know. You know,
ever since Mexico,

05:05.870 --> 05:07.349
something's been up with him.
I don't know what it is.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.346
I'm worried. He's, uh...

05:09.390 --> 05:11.858
I don't know.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.785
Keep an eye on him
out there, will you?

05:13.830 --> 05:15.525
Got his back, always.
All right?

05:15.570 --> 05:18.300
All right. Be safe.

05:23.230 --> 05:25.221
MAN:
Hey, can I get next over there?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.145
ERIC: All right.
Everybody, settle in.

05:27.190 --> 05:28.839
Listen up. Listen up!Kill the music.

05:28.890 --> 05:32.064
Today, we say our goodbyes

05:32.110 --> 05:33.543
to Davis here.WOMAN: All right.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.194
Something that's
never easy to do.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.366
Well, speak for yourself.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.024
Whoa. Wow.[laughter]

05:38.070 --> 05:39.549
Yeah, man, that's harsh.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.283
You know what, I don't know
what I'm gonna miss more,

05:41.340 --> 05:42.637
your sarcastic asses
or saving them.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.896
JASON:
When's the last time

05:43.950 --> 05:45.554
you saved my ass?When I saved your ass?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.033
Yeah, my ass.Start with the time

05:47.080 --> 05:48.468
that I told you
that your fly was down

05:48.520 --> 05:49.771
right before
you met the president,

05:49.820 --> 05:51.685
and then let's just
go from there.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.253
That was on purpose.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.348
[laughter]I remember that.

05:55.390 --> 05:58.302
So while we are saddened
to be losing her,

05:58.350 --> 06:02.787
this is _a rebirth _
for Petty Officer LIsa DaVIs,

06:02.840 --> 06:06.389
an evolution, if you will,
of a bright young sailor.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.406
Don't move.Uh-oh.

06:08.450 --> 06:09.667
[clears throat]

06:09.710 --> 06:11.268
So...

06:11.320 --> 06:12.799
Wow.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.272
JASON: Whoa, what is that?[group murmuring, oohing]

06:14.330 --> 06:15.888
Right? Right?

06:15.940 --> 06:17.453
Just something
to remember us by.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.933
JASON:
What does that say there?

06:18.980 --> 06:22.199
It says, "Lisa Davis.
Fair winds and following seas."

06:22.250 --> 06:23.467
JASON: Okay.
Wow.

06:23.510 --> 06:26.149
ERIC:
I came up with that.

06:26.210 --> 06:27.893
Um...

06:27.950 --> 06:29.338
Okay, what to say? Uh...

06:29.380 --> 06:33.202
You're my family,
and I'm leaving.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.479
That's life.
Everything comes to an end.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.476
Leaves fall. Close a book.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.249
You say goodbye.

06:40.310 --> 06:42.915
It still feels
all kinds of wrong [chuckles]

06:42.960 --> 06:46.430
to be, you know, leaving the
people that taught me so much.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.572
Mandy Ellis.

06:48.620 --> 06:51.271
Commander Blackburn.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.369
You taught me how to hold focus
when all is lost.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.313
Clay.

06:57.370 --> 07:00.237
You showed me what it is
to have a dream,

07:00.280 --> 07:03.716
and to fight so hard for it that
no one can take it from you.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.337
Sonny.

07:10.340 --> 07:12.638
You showed me what it is
to know who you are

07:12.690 --> 07:15.250
and where you're from
and to be proud of both.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.518
And I know that you really try
to convince everybody

07:17.560 --> 07:20.347
that you're just
a redneck...

07:20.390 --> 07:22.642
but you're more than that.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.082
You're a redneck that can cook.

07:26.140 --> 07:27.744
[laughter, murmuring]

07:27.790 --> 07:28.745
MAN:
That's right.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.439
And Ray Perry.

07:32.490 --> 07:34.538
You taught me
what integrity is,

07:34.580 --> 07:37.356
and that faith is sometimes
the best guide.

07:43.110 --> 07:45.419
And Bravo 1.

07:45.460 --> 07:48.839
You showed me
what real leaders do.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.289
They make the hard decisions
and they live with them.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.410
To not doubt,

07:53.470 --> 07:54.459
only decide.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.467
And I don't_ know what
I'm gonna do wrthout you guys,

07:58.520 --> 08:01.944
[voice breaks]: but...
I'm gonna miss you every day.JASON: Stop crying.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.251
Don't go there.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.380
You know what?
I'm not gonna go.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.862
Oh, no, no, no, no!I'm not gonna go.

08:08.920 --> 08:09.955
I'm gonna stay.[overlapping chatter]

08:10.010 --> 08:11.432
JASON:
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.219
Wait. Th-This is not
a goodbye, okay?

08:17.540 --> 08:19.485
This is a good thing.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.367
Come on, glasses up.

08:23.410 --> 08:24.798
Here's to Lisa.

08:24.850 --> 08:26.454
OTHERS:
To Lisa!

08:26.500 --> 08:29.105
The next step is
the right step,

08:29.160 --> 08:31.230
and you are taking
the right step.

08:31.290 --> 08:33.451
[others murmuring]MAN: Hear, hear.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.468
And the sprinklers?Sprinklers fall
under Mikey's watch.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.478
No, no, no. Oh, no.
Until Mikey is back

08:44.520 --> 08:47.478
from hockey camp, they fall
under your responsibility, so...

08:47.520 --> 08:49.602
Mikey and I are gonna be
parentless for three months,

08:49.650 --> 08:51.049
and you're worried
about the lawn?

08:51.090 --> 08:52.819
I'm worried about
a lot of things.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.610
I know. It's just nice
to hear you say it.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.571
I say it.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.919
Dad, we handled Mexico.

09:02.970 --> 09:05.757
Mikey and I will be okay while
you're in the Philippines.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.622
We're gonna make up for lost
time when I'm back, I promise.

09:09.670 --> 09:13.060
By the time you're back,
I'll be heading off to school.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.065
This is one of the last nights
we'll be under the same roof.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.111
[thunder rumbling softly]

09:29.480 --> 09:31.209
[chuckles]:
What's going on, man?

09:31.260 --> 09:33.649
You have one too many
at the barbecue?

09:33.700 --> 09:35.349
That's hard to say.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.470
I think that says it all.

09:37.530 --> 09:39.395
This is a
nice truck.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.226
Yeah.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.612
Makes a good bed, too.

09:42.660 --> 09:45.220
Crashing in it till I land
an EMT gig in town.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.625
I thought, uh, thought
you had some girl down here.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.228
Yeah, for a minute.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.191
She, uh... well,
she gave me the old heave-ho.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.673
[chuckles]:
How come?

09:53.720 --> 09:56.416
I, uh...

09:56.460 --> 09:58.678
I don't know.
I don't really remember.

10:02.510 --> 10:04.978
Look, Swanny, why-why don't
you stay at my place, man,

10:05.030 --> 10:07.248
my apartment while I'm gone.
You know, we're gonna deploy.

10:07.300 --> 10:10.463
I don't want to put you out,
man. I'll find something.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.169
No, seriously. I mean,
it's no skin off my nose.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.164
You should stay there.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.472
Are you sure?

10:15.520 --> 10:18.171
We're team guys; we got
to stick together, right?

10:19.480 --> 10:21.209
[music playing quietly]

10:21.270 --> 10:22.692
[knocking]

10:22.750 --> 10:24.650
Hey. Did you get
some rest last night?Mm-hmm.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.133
Good. Couple things I
want to go over with you.

10:27.190 --> 10:30.796
First, I don't want any parties
in the house, you understand?

10:30.840 --> 10:33.183
No kegs. And
that boy Noah,

10:33.240 --> 10:35.276
he's not_ even allowed
to sniff the grass

10:35.330 --> 10:36.934
in front there,
you understand?
[chuckles]

10:36.980 --> 10:38.629
Considering you decided
to clean your gun

10:38.680 --> 10:41.240
the last time he came over,
don't think you need to worry

10:41.290 --> 10:43.246
about Noah showing his face
at our house again.

10:43.290 --> 10:45.246
I didn't know that he was
gonna be coming over.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.815
Oh, that's a lie.
[laughs]Come on, Emma.

10:47.860 --> 10:50.909
Listen, number two: what
about the loans, the schools?

10:50.950 --> 10:52.292
Where are we
with all that?

10:52.340 --> 10:54.251
[sighs]
We're not eligible.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.348
You're over
the income threshold.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.255
That's crazy. That doesn't
make any sense to me.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.779
According to the
federal government,

10:59.830 --> 11:01.525
you're flush.Okay, that's great.

11:01.570 --> 11:04.175
I make too much money
to qualify for financial aid,

11:04.220 --> 11:05.175
but not enough

11:05.220 --> 11:07.131
to pay for your tuition
at school?

11:07.180 --> 11:08.738
Welcome to America.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.054
Well, okay, how about
my GI. Bill benefits?

11:11.100 --> 11:13.056
Covers about a quarter
of the total tuition.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.751
Got to be kidding me.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.314
Military subsidized loans?

11:20.330 --> 11:22.195
It's too late to apply.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.629
It's too late to apply? That
means you missed the deadline?

11:24.680 --> 11:27.114
You missed the deadline?

11:27.160 --> 11:29.720
How could you miss the deadline?I've got school,

11:29.770 --> 11:31.988
homework, student government,
vocal lessons,

11:32.030 --> 11:34.248
my own life and our life
I have to keep running

11:34.300 --> 11:35.426
when you're gone.

11:35.470 --> 11:38.940
I wish I could do
it all perfectly.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.217
I could still apply
for CommonBond,

11:40.260 --> 11:41.989
but they have
an origination fee.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.383
Origination fee, great.
How much does that cost?Don't know.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.260
I-I don't know
what any of it means.

11:46.310 --> 11:48.824
Mom would know.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.656
Yeah. Mom would've known.

11:56.230 --> 12:00.143
SONNY: You know,
I like the "Work Lisa,"

12:00.190 --> 12:02.750
definitely like me
some "Party Lisa,"

12:02.800 --> 12:04.279
but...

12:04.330 --> 12:07.151
I'll tell you what,

12:07.200 --> 12:09.156
kind of like
this Lisa the best.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.725
Oh, you like this
sweatpants, no makeup,

12:11.770 --> 12:13.943
gorging on strawberries Lisa?

12:13.990 --> 12:16.163
Yeah.

12:16.210 --> 12:20.078
Why do you have
so many strawberries?

12:20.130 --> 12:22.598
Oh, well, I needed the crate.

12:22.650 --> 12:26.086
The crate?Yeah, 'cause...

12:26.130 --> 12:30.339
You see, I thought I'd, uh,
well... [clears throat]

12:30.400 --> 12:33.301
I-I...

12:33.360 --> 12:36.352
I got you, like, a...

12:36.400 --> 12:38.095
Well, it's like, uh...

12:38.140 --> 12:40.791
Uh, oh, sorry.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.364
It's a going-away pallet.

12:42.410 --> 12:44.366
It's for you.

12:44.410 --> 12:46.230
[clears throat]

12:48.240 --> 12:51.289
Uh, the-the big one there,
that's-that's, those are,

12:51.330 --> 12:54.288
those are top-notch
chocolates.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.207
I'll bet they're good
currency in OCS.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.592
It's like cigs in prison.

12:59.380 --> 13:01.029
Might save you from
getting shiwed. [chuckles]

13:01.080 --> 13:04.425
I don't think there's a lot of
knife fights going down at OCS,

13:04.470 --> 13:06.779
but, um, thank you.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.601
Keep them boots shiny.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.697
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah.

13:16.750 --> 13:19.833
[laughs] Are you serious
right now?

13:19.880 --> 13:21.393
Officer and a Gentleman?

13:21.450 --> 13:23.406
It's a damn fine film.

13:23.450 --> 13:27.238
Although, now I think of it,
it does seem to make OCS,

13:27.280 --> 13:30.238
you know, a little ripe
for romance.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.067
Do you just think
that, like,

13:33.110 --> 13:35.419
every man is trying
to seduce me?

13:35.460 --> 13:37.064
Just takes one.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.542
Mm-hmm.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.465
You trying
to say something?
No.

13:40.510 --> 13:43.240
Uh, well... yes.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.427
1-1 was thinking, maybe,

13:45.470 --> 13:49.474
I would, I would tear up
my punch card

13:49.520 --> 13:51.340
to the Pleasure Palace
In Manila.

13:51.390 --> 13:53.563
As long as I don't play
"find my car keys"

13:53.610 --> 13:55.862
on some hot candidate's
body, right?

13:55.920 --> 13:57.478
Yeah.

13:57.530 --> 13:59.998
I'm good with that.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.439
Lisa...
Sonny.

14:02.490 --> 14:03.525
Uh-uh...

14:03.580 --> 14:05.662
[whispers]:
Don't say anything else.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.484
Okay.
Okay.

14:09.370 --> 14:12.885
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm gonna
be down here for a bit.

14:12.930 --> 14:15.398
Ring me whenever.
I got to go. Yeah.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.543
My sister. She, uh...

14:19.590 --> 14:23.629
she wasn't too hip on me
moving back down here.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.636
Love the place.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.499
Thanks again.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.939
Yeah, no, it's... no biggie.
No, this is... this is it.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.298
It's not much, you know,
and you can kind of see

14:33.350 --> 14:34.601
the whole place from right here.

14:34.650 --> 14:37.471
But help yourself
to whatever you need.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.909
Um, plumbing's a little
gunked up, so I...

14:39.960 --> 14:41.439
I got a, uh, a snake.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.438
It's underneath
the sink if you...

14:44.490 --> 14:45.616
You all right?

14:45.660 --> 14:48.049
I think I left my-my phone
in the car.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.056
You were just on it.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.398
Right.

14:55.110 --> 14:58.887
[chuckles] It's just my sister,
she, uh, she calls a lot.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.319
The thing is, my,
uh, my dad, he...

15:02.370 --> 15:03.928
he died two months ago.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.200
I'm sorry, man. I'm sure that's,
I'm sure it's hard on her.

15:09.250 --> 15:12.333
It's harder for me.
Women are better at loss.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.940
Men don't have a clue.
Women process It.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.513
We just want to
punch something.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.085
[chuckles] She gets worried
if I don't answer.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.439
She's... she's a good sister.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.617
Gucci deployment.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.560
Huh?

15:27.620 --> 15:29.349
I'm jealous.Yeah, you know.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.836
I'm kind of in the mood to fight
right now, if I'm being honest.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.531
I get it. Keeps
the mind occupied.

15:35.580 --> 15:39.107
But trust me, a little bit
of fun can do a world of good.

15:39.150 --> 15:42.142
A PACOM deployment
is a terrible thing to waste.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.498
[chuckles]

15:44.550 --> 15:47.986
Hey, babe, it's about time
to get on...MEL: There he is.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.543
Pastor Mel.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.727
Hey, just thought
I'd drop by.

15:51.770 --> 15:52.987
Oh.

15:53.030 --> 15:54.986
Haven't seen you in a bit, Ray.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.464
Yeah, well, uh, I've been busy
getting ready for deployment.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.420
Yeah, well, I guess you're gonna
have to content yourself

16:00.480 --> 16:02.425
with having Bible study
on base then, huh?

16:02.480 --> 16:03.378
[chuckles]

16:03.440 --> 16:05.567
Yeah, something
like that. Um...

16:05.610 --> 16:08.522
Uh, what is this?
What's... what's going on?

16:08.570 --> 16:12.301
Well, we just thought we'd set
a baptism date for baby RJ.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.056
Uh, I don't know.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.091
Well, listen, Naima and I
will handle all the details.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.617
You know, we'll figure out
a good time,

16:18.670 --> 16:20.365
after your deployment,
of course.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.878
No. 1-1 mean,

16:22.930 --> 16:24.716
I mean, I don't know.
I, uh...

16:24.760 --> 16:26.716
I...

16:26.760 --> 16:28.671
You know what, Pastor Mel,
[sighs]

16:28.720 --> 16:30.768
this r-- this really isn't
a good time right now.

16:30.810 --> 16:32.118
You think maybe I could, uh,

16:32.160 --> 16:33.639
talk to my wife?

16:33.680 --> 16:35.204
Alone.

16:36.510 --> 16:39.331
Of course. Of course. I have
another apponntment anyway.

16:41.390 --> 16:43.381
I'll be praying for you, Ray.

16:50.130 --> 16:51.654
[door closes]

16:51.700 --> 16:54.260
Have you lost
your damn mind?
Excuse me?

16:54.310 --> 16:56.096
You bring him over here
to ambush me?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.960
No, he dropped in,
like he said,

16:58.010 --> 17:00.183
because he's worried about you.He's worried?

17:00.230 --> 17:01.572
About me?He's not the only one.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.224
Y-You're drinking too much,
ignoring the family.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.975
I mean, what is going on?

17:05.020 --> 17:07.102
Nothing's
going on, Naima.

17:07.150 --> 17:08.754
All right, the team's
needed me more than usual.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.061
Everyone's going through
a lot right now.

17:10.110 --> 17:12.066
Well, you won't talk to me.About what?!

17:12.110 --> 17:14.192
Mexico.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.059
What happened
in Mexico?

17:16.120 --> 17:18.896
Nothing. Okay, honey?
Nothing happened in Mexico.

17:18.950 --> 17:23.512
Okay. Well, how about why you
don't want RJ to be baptized?

17:25.820 --> 17:28.163
What do you care
about it anyway?

17:28.220 --> 17:30.165
Naima, you don't
even believe in God.

17:30.220 --> 17:33.212
What does someone like you
care about something like that?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.478
[scoffs softly]

17:35.530 --> 17:37.043
This isn't you.

17:37.090 --> 17:40.480
This isn't the man
I married.

17:40.530 --> 17:43.135
This is the man I found.

17:43.190 --> 17:47.308
The broken sailor who needed
six whiskey gingers to sleep.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.277
I don't want that man to
come home from the Philippines.

18:01.420 --> 18:03.149
I'm driving myself

18:03.210 --> 18:05.462
to base.

18:05.510 --> 18:07.250
You say goodbye to me!

18:07.300 --> 18:10.349
You tell me you love me! Ray![door slams shut]

18:15.790 --> 18:17.735
Hey. Ready to head
to the airfield?

18:17.790 --> 18:19.212
I spoke
to CommonBond.

18:19.270 --> 18:22.137
If we pay the origination fee,
they'll process my loan.

18:29.320 --> 18:33.313
Okay, um,
I have to pay this now?

18:33.370 --> 18:35.065
2% of the total four-year loan.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.542
Well, we have three weeks.

18:40.590 --> 18:44.333
[sighs] Emma, I, um, I have
to move money and everything.

18:44.380 --> 18:47.554
You don't want me to go, do you?

18:49.300 --> 18:52.337
You want everything to stay the
same, like we're stuck in time.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.995
You don't want me to leave when
you leave every two seconds.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.291
It's not that.Then what is it?

18:56.350 --> 18:57.999
It's not-- Look, it's the loans.

18:58.040 --> 19:03.046
I don't want you to spend the
next 20 years drowning in debt

19:03.090 --> 19:06.787
and all you have to show for it
is a... is an art degree.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.225
Wow, Dad.

19:12.670 --> 19:14.626
I'll figure it out on my own.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.399
Have fun over there.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.276
You know, Ray, last time you
showed up at the tarmac alone,

19:58.320 --> 20:00.276
you were single.

20:02.280 --> 20:06.410
Uh, it's... it's Jameelah;
she got the flu.

20:06.460 --> 20:08.678
Yeah.

20:08.720 --> 20:12.201
Yeah. Emma-- she must
have the same bug.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.296
Yeah, must be
going around.

20:17.340 --> 20:20.514
Yeah. Something's
going around.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.093
CLAY: Man, it's hotter than
a two-dollar pistol out here.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.529
SONNY: It's way more balmy
than Baghdad.

20:39.580 --> 20:42.185
There ain't enough
talcum powder in the world

20:42.240 --> 20:43.446
to keep my boys from chafing.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.058
Beats the hell out
of that dog kennel

20:45.110 --> 20:46.407
_ we_ were in
In MeXIco, though.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.451
[pop music playing quietly
over speakers]

20:51.810 --> 20:54.415
All right.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.688
Welcome to the Gucci, boys.

20:56.730 --> 20:58.595
ERIC: All right.Yeah.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.596
Two days till the first
training exercise,

21:00.650 --> 21:02.641
so until then,
your time is yours.

21:02.690 --> 21:04.339
Jace and Ray.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.779
Standard liberty rules apply.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.866
Trent, Brock. Behave
yourselves, make sure

21:08.910 --> 21:10.650
I don't have to do
any paperwork, got it?

21:10.700 --> 21:12.304
CLAY:
Whoa, no, bad idea.

21:12.350 --> 21:13.783
He's gonna lose that.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.741
SONNY:
That is a good call.
More importantly, Blackburn,

21:15.790 --> 21:18.008
how many times a day
can I go to the omelet bar?

21:18.050 --> 21:19.358
That's all
I want to know.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.446
[laughs]:
Oh, gosh.

21:20.490 --> 21:21.741
Come on. I'm out.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.313
Be sure to look
into that.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.534
Yeah. Figure that out later on.
Hey, any word from Mandy?

21:26.580 --> 21:29.231
Embassy.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.406
Anything brewing?

21:30.460 --> 21:32.325
Uh, nothing to talk about yet.

21:32.370 --> 21:33.803
Mm-hmm.

21:37.290 --> 21:40.339
GARY:
Got the VDR from
the container ship.

21:40.380 --> 21:42.029
One day here and you're
already searching

21:42.080 --> 21:43.593
for a new target package?

21:43.650 --> 21:47.768
Four maritime collisions in
the region the past four months,

21:47.820 --> 21:50.038
two mysterious
plane crashes?

21:50.090 --> 21:53.344
I'd say the target
package chose us.

21:53.390 --> 21:55.346
NAVIGATOR [over recording]:
Captain, the navigational system

21:55.400 --> 21:58.085
isn't responding. We're heading
right for that ship.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.131
CAPTAIN:
Go to manual.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.135
NAVIGATOR:
It won't respond.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.659
CAPTAIN:
Override.

22:02.710 --> 22:04.359
NAVIGATOR:
Captain, I tried to override.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.878
Someone else has control
of our ship.

22:06.930 --> 22:09.103
Captain, coming at us, portside!

22:09.150 --> 22:10.367
CAPTAIN:
Sound the alarm.

22:10.410 --> 22:11.889
NAVIGATOR:
Collision alarm not initiating!

22:11.930 --> 22:13.329
CAPTAIN:
Brace for impact.

22:15.370 --> 22:17.281
[static crackles,
recording ends]

22:17.330 --> 22:20.595
A remote takeover of
all naVIgatIonal systems.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.074
Who could
pull that off?

22:23.120 --> 22:25.463
Not many.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.512
[music playing quietly
over speakers]

22:30.340 --> 22:33.161
CLAY: Hey, I'm gonna go
crush the gym. You coming?

22:33.220 --> 22:35.381
Man, you never
slow down, do you?

22:35.440 --> 22:37.249
Why would I?Well...

22:37.310 --> 22:39.471
I'm thinking about,
you know, heading into town

22:39.530 --> 22:41.304
and getting a little massage.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.225
Why don't you come?

22:43.270 --> 22:45.318
We've only been here 20 minutes
and you already want

22:45.360 --> 22:47.396
an old-fashioned?I'm talking about
a real massage.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.702
See, I-I got this
kink in my neck,

22:49.750 --> 22:51.798
so I called the concierge
about them firm pillows

22:51.840 --> 22:53.182
'cause of my slipped disk.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.491
Them big ol' pillows here,

22:54.540 --> 22:56.496
they're messing with
my sciatica.

22:56.540 --> 22:59.100
Who are you and what
have you done with Sonny Quinn?

23:00.680 --> 23:04.241
Sonny Quinn's happy place
used to be kicking in doors.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.155
Yeah.Making canoes out of skulls,

23:06.210 --> 23:07.893
covered in stripper glitter,
and getting drunk.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.338
And now it's
this? It's...

23:09.380 --> 23:11.598
[laughs]...it's soft pillows
and legit massages?

23:11.650 --> 23:13.732
Come on, dude.Hey, you are
getting soft, buddy.

23:13.780 --> 23:16.601
There's a time and a place
for everything, young Jedi.

23:16.650 --> 23:19.084
But you ain't ever been
on a Gucci mission

23:19.130 --> 23:20.210
with Sonny Quinn.

23:20.260 --> 23:22.342
I am a man of leisure.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.130
Now, if you want
to be ready to charge,

23:25.180 --> 23:27.967
you got to recharge
the mind and the body.

23:28.010 --> 23:29.318
Look around, man.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.351
Why don't you go
chase some tail?

23:33.360 --> 23:34.884
Doesn't appeal.

23:34.930 --> 23:37.103
Well, what does?The job.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.368
All right.

23:39.410 --> 23:41.366
All right, well,

23:41.420 --> 23:43.627
you enjoy that nice little
massage there, princess.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.159
I will.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.758
Maybe later we can hit
Bed Bath & Beyond.

23:46.810 --> 23:49.415
What the hell's
Bed Bath & Beyond?

23:51.210 --> 23:53.292
Emma? You kidding me?

23:53.340 --> 23:55.854
Emma, you there?

23:55.910 --> 23:58.037
Emma, are you there?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.253
EMMA:
I answered the phone, didn't I?

24:05.440 --> 24:08.170
All right, look, Emma.

24:08.220 --> 24:09.869
Just do me a favor, will you?

24:09.920 --> 24:12.309
Just, um, let's breathe
this out and be calm.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.578
I just want you to e-mail me
all the loan applications

24:14.620 --> 24:16.611
so I can help you out
with it, all right?

24:16.670 --> 24:18.968
Whatever.

24:19.020 --> 24:21.659
Look, um, I'm sorry.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.847
Okay?

24:23.890 --> 24:26.495
I'm sorry the way
we left things.

24:26.550 --> 24:29.018
And how we got into
that whole argument.

24:29.070 --> 24:30.503
I didn't like it.

24:30.550 --> 24:33.769
You know, I love you,
and I... I miss you. I...

24:33.820 --> 24:35.071
[line beeps]

24:37.430 --> 24:39.682
And I wasn't talking to anybody
and she didn't hear

24:39.730 --> 24:42.198
a word I said
because it got disconnected.

24:42.260 --> 24:45.434
Hayes.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.254
How you doing?

24:47.310 --> 24:49.301
[chuckles]: No way.
Zell, what's up?How you doing, man?

24:49.350 --> 24:51.136
Hey.
Good to see you.
Good to--

24:51.180 --> 24:53.000
God, to be honest,
I didn't even recognize you.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.654
Wow, look at that.
Nice watch.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.314
Ah, a little flashy
for my taste,

24:56.360 --> 24:58.703
but it was a gift from a client.

24:58.750 --> 25:01.093
And he_has
nuclear capabilities, so...

25:01.150 --> 25:03.368
You're working
private security now, right?Yeah. Yeah.

25:03.410 --> 25:05.139
_ _Yeah._
Six international
offices now

25:05.190 --> 25:06.270
and opening
more every day.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.752
It's been quite a ride.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.755
Yeah, I bet.[laughs] Feels like a lifetime

25:09.810 --> 25:12.028
since we were, uh,
eating sand in J-Bad, huh?

25:12.070 --> 25:13.935
Uh, I think we were doing more
than just eating sand.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.321
[laughs]
So you're still in?

25:15.380 --> 25:16.677
You're still grinding?Yeah, yeah.

25:16.730 --> 25:18.721
Still in, still grinding.
You know, pays the bills.

25:18.770 --> 25:21.557
Yeah, well, not as much as it
should though, am I right?

25:21.600 --> 25:23.124
Yeah.

25:23.170 --> 25:24.990
Hey, look, I, uh,
I'm gonna be

25:25.040 --> 25:26.996
around for a few days;
you-you want to grab a beer?

25:27.040 --> 25:29.508
Sure. Yeah, I don't think
they can handle us, but yeah.[phone ringing]

25:29.570 --> 25:31.379
Look, I got to, uh,
I got to take this.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.919
But I'll reach out.Okay, yeah.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.564
Good to see you, man.Good to see you, too.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.963
Yeah?

25:37.010 --> 25:39.001
[phone chimes]

25:42.270 --> 25:45.398
MILLER:_
My name is
Gunnery Sergeant Miller.

25:45.450 --> 25:48.010
I am your enlisted instructor.

25:48.060 --> 25:50.938
My mission
over the next 12 weeks

25:50.980 --> 25:52.709
is to do only one thing,

25:52.760 --> 25:55.581
and _that is to take
what is ordinary, you,

25:55.640 --> 25:58.632
and turn you into an officer.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.069
If you don't possess
the highest integrity

26:01.120 --> 26:04.556
and military virtue,
know your history,

26:04.600 --> 26:07.296
and give nothing less
than 100% at all times,

26:07.340 --> 26:09.865
you will not make it!

26:09.910 --> 26:11.958
If you do not love your country,

26:12.000 --> 26:13.820
then you already are
a pathetic failure

26:13.870 --> 26:16.919
and I will send you back
to whatever hole you come from,

26:20.140 --> 26:23.485
If you D.O.R.,
drop on request,

26:23.530 --> 26:26.579
I won't care, because
I'm not your mama

26:26.620 --> 26:28.315
or your keeper.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.579
You will simply give up,
walk out that door,

26:31.630 --> 26:34.884
and_ no one here will ever
think about you again!

26:34.940 --> 26:38.239
Did I tell you to eyeball
my area, Candidate?!

26:38.290 --> 26:40.929
No!Shut your mouth!

26:40.990 --> 26:42.935
Did I say speak?!

26:44.950 --> 26:47.077
I will treat each
of you equally

26:47.120 --> 26:49.293
until I expect
something of you.

26:49.340 --> 26:52.992
From then on,
welcome to Darwinism.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.862
Survival of the fittest,
the strongest,

26:56.910 --> 26:58.389
and the smartest.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.658
I am not supposed
to put it in those terms,

27:00.700 --> 27:03.260
but that's what it is--
real life--

27:03.310 --> 27:06.837
which will be quite a change
for you safe-space, snowflake,

27:06.880 --> 27:09.963
fly under the radar,
don't want to be noticed,

27:10.010 --> 27:12.274
pajama boys and girls,
understood?!

27:12.320 --> 27:13.753
CANDIDATES:
Yes, ma'am!

27:13.800 --> 27:15.358
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant!

27:15.410 --> 27:16.968
That was my first expectation,

27:17.020 --> 27:19.750
that you answer
a question correctly.

27:19.810 --> 27:22.108
Very simple,
yet most of you failed.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.803
Except for you.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.896
You prior enlisted,
Candidate?

27:27.950 --> 27:29.463
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant,
eight years!

27:29.510 --> 27:31.205
Thought you looked
a little old for OCS.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.296
Where you from,
Candidate?

27:32.340 --> 27:34.126
Detroit, Gunnery Sergeant!

27:34.170 --> 27:36.991
Once a decent city ruined by
parasites and bureaucrats.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.031
Candidate Davis,
part of my duty

27:39.090 --> 27:41.433
is to appoint a
leader to each class.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.789
This is a very serious
responsibility,

27:43.830 --> 27:45.912
and I am giving this
responsibility to you.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.780
Do you think
you are up to it?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.705
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant!

27:49.750 --> 27:51.877
I have been a
marine for 15 years

27:51.930 --> 27:53.795
and an instructor
for three.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.707
And in every class,
every single one of them,

27:56.760 --> 27:59.058
the first leader D.O.R.'d.

27:59.110 --> 28:02.489
Why? Because what all leaders
must come to terms with

28:02.550 --> 28:06.975
is that they will be
treated unequally.

28:07.030 --> 28:09.328
And that is the weight
that they crack under,

28:09.380 --> 28:11.632
the weight of actual
responsibility,

28:11.690 --> 28:13.078
actual accountability,

28:13.120 --> 28:16.556
and it actually being
your ass on the line.

28:16.600 --> 28:20.218
So, everything that
your class does wrong,

28:20.260 --> 28:23.252
starting now, is your fault.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.045
[country music playing
over speakers]

28:40.670 --> 28:43.366
Nice house. But I know
the guy who lives there.

28:43.410 --> 28:45.196
I don't think
he's the selling type.

28:45.240 --> 28:48.232
Can't stay away from me, huh?[laughs]

28:48.290 --> 28:49.769
What's that about?

28:49.810 --> 28:53.337
This? This is
about... college.

28:53.380 --> 28:54.938
That's what that is about.Emma's.

28:54.990 --> 28:56.150
Yeah, Emma's.

28:56.210 --> 28:58.246
Was trying to figure
out how to pay for it.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.518
Yeah, I hear you.Mm-hmm.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.165
Rate I'm going...

29:03.210 --> 29:06.646
I'll have my loans
paid off in 2050.

29:06.700 --> 29:09.260
Mm-hmm. See,
that's the thing.

29:09.310 --> 29:11.266
I don't want her to be in debt
for her whole life.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.959
Right? I mean, you really think

29:13.010 --> 29:14.261
that she can make it
as a Singer?

29:14.310 --> 29:17.780
Odds are better in New York
than Virginia Beach.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.925
Look, Jason,
she's got a dream.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.574
If she's anything
like her father,

29:23.630 --> 29:25.712
she's gonna follow it
with or without your help.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.228
I just wish I could pay
for it, that's all.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.236
Straight-out. But
I can't, you know?

29:30.290 --> 29:33.236
[clears throat]Well, if you sell the house...

29:34.770 --> 29:36.761
...put a good dent
in the cost.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.151
Yeah.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.068
Selling the house.

29:45.130 --> 29:47.769
It's tough.
Lot of memories there.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.163
A lot to think about.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.562
Yeah.

29:51.610 --> 29:53.168
Yeah, it is.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.176
[clears throat]

29:55.220 --> 29:57.359
Well, you're looking great.
[clears throat]

29:57.400 --> 29:59.220
[chuckles]You getting out there again?

29:59.270 --> 30:00.919
Back in the saddle, you mean?[laughs]

30:00.970 --> 30:03.006
Nothing serious, I would say.Oh.

30:03.060 --> 30:04.709
But, uh, yeah.

30:04.750 --> 30:05.830
Good for you.

30:05.890 --> 30:07.881
How about you?[phone vibrates]

30:07.930 --> 30:09.886
Oh. [clears throat]Whoa, look at that, huh?

30:09.930 --> 30:11.886
Saved by the buzz,
aren't we?

30:11.940 --> 30:14.010
We got to go.Okay.

30:14.070 --> 30:15.719
Got this?

30:15.770 --> 30:17.931
Yep, I got it.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.151
That's for you.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.339
Four days ago
off the coast of Japan,

30:22.380 --> 30:24.723
a Navy supply ship collided
with a container ship.

30:24.770 --> 30:28.126
One casualty,
a billion dollars of damages.

30:28.170 --> 30:31.549
The collision was as a result
of a coordinated cyber attack.

30:31.610 --> 30:34.124
The nav systems of both ships
were compromised.

Just an hour ago,

30:35.570 --> 30:37.344
Filipino tanker
in the Sulu Sea

30:37.400 --> 30:39.049
was targeted by
the same malware.

30:39.090 --> 30:40.876
It ran into _
an underwater mountain.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.137
Had that tanker been full,

30:42.180 --> 30:44.876
we'd be looking at a massive
ecological disaster.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.136
MANDY:
We were able to pinpoint

30:46.190 --> 30:47.441
the source
of the most recent attack

30:47.490 --> 30:48.661
to a small aircraft,

30:48.710 --> 30:50.962
which appears
to have crash-landed here,

30:51.020 --> 30:54.057
an island in the South
China Sea, Panatag Shoal.

30:54.110 --> 30:56.544
We need to recover
this technology.

30:56.590 --> 30:59.058
Studying it will allow us
to defeat it.

30:59.110 --> 31:00.930
Well, South China Sea,
that's contested territory.

31:00.980 --> 31:02.242
ERIC:
Exactly.

31:02.290 --> 31:04.758
So no ISR. Zero footprint.

31:04.810 --> 31:07.893
Make things more difficult,
Panatag Shoal is covered

31:07.950 --> 31:10.418
with dense jungle
and bamboo forest,

31:10.470 --> 31:12.381
so we have no eyes
on the wreckage.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.512
Any survivors in the crash?Also unclear.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.438
The Chinese will be sending
its own team to get the tech.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.301
You're to refrain from engaging
unless fired upon.

31:20.350 --> 31:23.046
There's been no movement
in or towards the area,

31:23.090 --> 31:24.569
so let's infil quickly
and get out

31:24.620 --> 31:25.962
before the enemy arrives.
Let's go.

33:17.380 --> 33:18.859
Someone climbed out.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.856
Means we got a survivor
out there.

33:20.910 --> 33:23.253
Havoc, this is 1.
We got two dead.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.086
Looks like we got a survivor,
left the trail.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.258
Copy, Bravo 1.
Stand by.

33:28.310 --> 33:31.211
If that person is alive, we need
to bring them in right away.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.215
He could be a gold mine
of intelligence.

33:33.270 --> 33:35.044
He might've taken some
of the tech with him.

Chinese soldier
hasn't fired on an American

36:16.470 --> 36:17.425
since the Korean War.

36:17.470 --> 36:18.732
That might change today.

36:26.530 --> 36:27.918
Hey.
Yeah?

36:27.960 --> 36:29.484
They're gonna be able
to triangulate our position

36:29.530 --> 36:30.747
using our
radio signals.

36:30.790 --> 36:32.394
We need to go dark until exfil.

I'll-I'll circle round,

36:54.210 --> 36:55.632
meet up with you.
I'm gonna take my radio

36:55.690 --> 36:57.555

some sort of false trail.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.386
It's not a good idea for you

37:17.800 --> 37:19.097
They're marking the

37:19.140 --> 37:20.755
They're gonna
bomb the site.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.574
That's just gonna destroy the

track away from us.

38:38.570 --> 38:40.094
Should buy us a few minutes.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.418
It was your responsibility,

39:06.470 --> 39:08.290
to inspect

into a corner, and sand,

39:16.130 --> 39:18.382
sand in Candidate Salmon's
dress shoes.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.089
Why did you fail?

There wasn't enough time to
properly inspect the rooms,

with you, inside.

No, Gunnery
S-Sergeant Miller.

you are worthless as a leader,

40:06.750 --> 40:09.218

and worthless to the Navy.

Well, they're not exactly
thrilled that our boy Clay

40:52.880 --> 40:54.609
left an encrypted
communication device

40:54.660 --> 40:57.447
in the hands
of the Chinese.

40:57.490 --> 41:00.232
Okay, well, our orders
were not to engage,

41:00.280 --> 41:02.271
and his move
prevented engagement.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.322
Yeah, well, I'm not the one
that needs convincing.

41:04.370 --> 41:05.928
As far as Command is concerned,

41:05.980 --> 41:08.448
this falls under the broader
pattern of rislq behavior.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.628
I'm sorry, risky behavior?
Okay, like what?

41:16.690 --> 41:18.499
Jason, cut the attitude.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.030
All right, this could affect
you, me, the entire team.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.514
We need Command to
be happy with us,

41:24.560 --> 41:27.825

are gonna become
extremely unpleasant.
