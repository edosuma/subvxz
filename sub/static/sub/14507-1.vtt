08:05.653 --> 08:06.987

08:07.028 --> 08:08.280
- Well, what's wrong with that?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.950
- I hate it, and I'll tell
you why, it was terrible.

08:10.950 --> 08:11.950
I'm not gonna worry about it now.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.078
We're losing light, and it's
a long way back to the hotel.

08:14.078 --> 08:15.872
Let's wrap it up everybody, that's a wrap.

08:15.872 --> 08:16.913
- You heard the man.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.335
- What's up, Rosie?

08:21.335 --> 08:24.130
- It's Rose and here's your
call sheet for tomorrow.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.717
- Five AM, how am I supposed
to be a sex bomb at five AM?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.637
- Want me to give you a wakeup call?

08:31.887 --> 08:32.763
- Milo!

08:35.515 --> 08:37.602
(gentle music)

08:37.602 --> 08:39.312
- Kimmy giving you trouble again?

08:42.815 --> 08:44.942
'Cause if she is I can chop chop.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.027
- That is so...

08:46.027 --> 08:47.362
- Romantic?

08:47.362 --> 08:48.778
- I was gonna say psychotic,
but we can go with romantic,

08:48.820 --> 08:49.655
sure.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.242
- Well, that's how I
roll, baby, stunt man.

08:52.242 --> 08:53.492
So you want to get a drink
with me when we get back

08:54.535 --> 08:57.455
- I'd like that, but I have
script revisions to go over

08:57.455 --> 08:58.915
- Bring your laptop.
- I don't know.

08:58.915 --> 09:01.000
- Come on, just one drink.
- Just one.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.087
- Just one, I promise, I'll
see you at the bar at five.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.007
(romantic music)

09:11.343 --> 09:13.137
Hey, what's up, Gunner?

09:16.140 --> 09:16.557
- Fine.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.850
Now what is it, Kimmy?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.310
- Milo, don't do this to me.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.105
- Wait, wait, wait, we've been
on set two weeks, it's Milo.

09:23.147 --> 09:24.482
Now what's the problem?

09:24.482 --> 09:26.067
- What's the difference?

09:26.067 --> 09:29.695
Five AM, how am I supposed
to be hot at five AM?

09:29.695 --> 09:32.490
- Kimmy, you're gorgeous 24/7, okay?

09:32.490 --> 09:35.033
I got enough problems.
- Milo!

09:40.163 --> 09:42.917
- Hey, Rose, have you
seen Bob's light meter?

09:42.917 --> 09:44.752
Rose, light meter?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.295
- Try down by the pond.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.588
- Okay, thanks.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.185
- Yep.

11:24.185 --> 11:25.393
- Could I get you folks
another round of drinks?

11:25.435 --> 11:27.103
- Yes, two more.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.773
- Oh my gosh, you are
such a bad influence.

11:29.773 --> 11:33.277
- No, I am actually a very
good influence and you know it.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.403
Rose, look, we're in paradise
here and all you can think

11:35.445 --> 11:36.530
about is work.

11:36.572 --> 11:40.367
- Yeah, well I love my job
and I love making movies.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.537
- So do I, but you can't
let it consume your life.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.500
- You know, you're pretty smart for a guy

11:48.542 --> 11:50.878
who likes to jump off buildings.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.170
- I have my moments.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.047
- Yeah, one.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.008
- What is, I thought you
were working on the script,

11:57.050 --> 11:58.343
what is--
- I was, but then

11:58.385 --> 12:01.847
I stumbled upon this when I
was fact checking a scene.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.307
Oh my gosh, check this out.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.225
- What is that?

12:06.227 --> 12:07.895
- I know, isn't it crazy?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.940
Some creature from Polynesian
folklore, the peepalo,

12:10.940 --> 12:14.527
a river devil, they've been
sighted for hundreds of years

12:14.527 --> 12:19.323
and then now it's saying that
one was just spotted last week

12:19.323 --> 12:21.117
(man chuckles nervously)

12:21.117 --> 12:23.202
- God, you're cute, you
don't really believe this,

12:23.202 --> 12:23.993
do you?

12:24.035 --> 12:25.495
- Yes.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.413
Yeah, I--

12:26.413 --> 12:27.665
- Yoohoo, what are you
guys doing over there?

12:27.665 --> 12:31.668
- Nothing, Kimmy, just
preparing for tomorrow's shoot.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.378
- Well, then you won't
mind if I borrow Jack.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.757
There's a spot on my back I can't reach.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.343
- Kimmy, we're actually
kinda busy right now.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.595
- It'll only take a minute.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.223
You wouldn't want your star
to burn now, would you?

12:45.682 --> 12:48.435
- I will be right back, I promise.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.230
(idyllic music)

12:54.858 --> 12:55.985
- Thanks, Jack.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.822

15:10.202 --> 15:13.413

15:13.455 --> 15:14.623

15:14.623 --> 15:16.708
- Who?
- Kimmy Weston.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.210
I'm gonna ask.
- Whatever.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.920
- Excuse me, are you Kimmy Weston?

15:22.130 --> 15:23.465
- I'm kind of a big deal.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.135
- Oh man, I knew it, see,
I told you it was her.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.220
- Yeah, terrific.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.850
- I have seen all of your
pictures, even Hillbilly Hostage.

15:32.850 --> 15:36.062
I don't care what the critics
say, you were great in that.

15:36.062 --> 15:37.562
- I know, right?

15:37.603 --> 15:38.730
- Could you do the line?

15:38.772 --> 15:41.150
- Oh, I couldn't possibly.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.568
- Please, it would make my year.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.450
- (sighs) Suck lead, you
hillbilly butt nugget. (laughs)

15:49.450 --> 15:51.452
- (laughs) That is so great.

15:51.452 --> 15:52.662
- Awesome.

15:52.662 --> 15:53.995
- I've got to get a picture.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.497
- Well, then, you'll want
a picture with Jack, too,

15:55.538 --> 15:57.373
'cause he's not only a stunt man,

15:57.415 --> 15:59.042
he is the head chopper himself.

16:00.043 --> 16:00.877
- No way! (laughs)

16:00.918 --> 16:02.503
Honey, get a picture of us quick.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.340
- Okay, everybody ready?

16:07.342 --> 16:09.803
And say cheese.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.015
- Look, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.727
- Jack, where are you going?

16:18.728 --> 16:20.480
(shutter clicks)

16:20.522 --> 16:23.108
(phone rings)

16:24.652 --> 16:27.028
- Yes, they're all here.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.240
Tomorrow should be no problem.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.077
Yep.

16:34.495 --> 16:37.330
- (laughs) Kimmy, what a piece of work.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.373
What are you doing, where are you going?

16:38.373 --> 16:39.207
We're having a good time.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.585
- I have a job to do and
I can't compete with that.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.588
- Rose, sit down, would you?

16:44.588 --> 16:45.422
- I'll see you on set.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.590
- Rose, Rose!

16:52.012 --> 16:55.265
(Jack sighs)

16:55.307 --> 16:58.018

17:49.152 --> 17:49.987

(gun cocks)

17:56.743 --> 17:57.618
Move.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.038
Move!

18:02.290 --> 18:04.877
(eerie music)

18:13.760 --> 18:15.637

18:26.232 --> 18:29.025
- Robert Lovegrove of
the University of Hawaii.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.527
- Right.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.905
- Your faculty ID says you're
a professor of herpetology.

18:32.905 --> 18:34.573
Reptiles, right?
- That's a fact.

18:34.573 --> 18:38.202
Listen, whatever your name is...

18:39.410 --> 18:41.663
I don't know why you're keeping me here,

18:41.663 --> 18:43.332
but you're making a big mistake.

18:43.332 --> 18:46.877
There's a great big creature
out there, very dangerous.

18:46.877 --> 18:50.005
It'll get out of the
jungle, gonna kill us all.

18:50.005 --> 18:53.342
- No, no, wait, don't tell me,
not the mythical river demon.

18:53.342 --> 18:56.262
100 feet long, teeth like daggers?

18:56.262 --> 18:59.180
(group laughs)

18:59.222 --> 19:00.557
- It's not mythical.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.852
Evolutionary mutation turned
it into a dangerous predator

19:03.893 --> 19:04.978
and it's hungry.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.688
- Very interesting.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.400
But I don't care about your fairy tales

19:10.442 --> 19:11.693
or your stupid turtle.

19:13.112 --> 19:15.863
What I do care about is
money and how much someone

19:15.905 --> 19:18.575
is willing to pay me for your safe return.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.537
- I don't know if you've looked
in here, but that enough?

19:22.578 --> 19:25.040
- That'll do for a down payment.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.208
- My family's very wealthy.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.043
If you want money, they'll
pay to get me out of here.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.587
I still think we need to
get out of this jungle

19:30.628 --> 19:31.963
as soon as possible.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.465
- I'll tell you when we leave.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.302
Sleep tight, you'll have company later on.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.807
- Get up.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.433
(eerie music)

19:57.363 --> 19:59.617
I'll bring you food later.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.038
(dramatic music)

20:44.535 --> 20:47.747
- Come, this way, not much farther.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.792
- Better not be, it feels
like we've been hiking

20:49.792 --> 20:52.085
10 miles since we left the car behind.

20:52.127 --> 20:54.212
- More like three, but
I know what you mean,

20:54.253 --> 20:55.755
it's practically all been uphill.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.592
- Tell me about it, you sure
it's worth the trip, Doctor?

20:58.592 --> 21:01.177
- Vicky, if we find a
ghost orchid, it will be.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.305
- It just seems like we're
spending a lot of time and money

21:03.305 --> 21:04.682
just to look at a flower.

21:04.682 --> 21:07.100
- Ah, but one of the rarest
flowers in the world,

21:07.142 --> 21:10.562
allegedly imbued with
miraculous recuperative powers.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.813
- Really?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.148
- Well, the Mayans swore by them.

21:13.148 --> 21:16.067
So did the medicine men of the
Arapaho and Apalachee tribes

21:16.108 --> 21:17.735
in the Southern Everglades.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.572
Professor Samson even brought
one back to UMC in '89.

21:21.657 --> 21:22.448
- I remember you talking about that.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.660
But didn't you say the
flower's effects weaken

21:24.660 --> 21:26.828
by the time it takes to
get it back to the lab?

21:26.828 --> 21:29.122
- Correct, but it was
still noted that the petals

21:29.163 --> 21:31.500
showed remarkable healing ability.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.043
- Well, if it's so remarkable,
then why isn't everyone

21:33.043 --> 21:34.460
trying to grow them?

21:34.502 --> 21:36.755
- Pardon the pun, but that's
the root of the problem.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.798
The ghost orchid can
remain inactive for years,

21:38.840 --> 21:41.552
sometimes decades, then
just suddenly bloom,

21:41.552 --> 21:45.347
sometimes three times in a
year, never in captivity.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.348
- [Girl] What happens if
we do happen to find one?

21:47.390 --> 21:48.392
(creature growls)

21:48.392 --> 21:49.225
- That's what why we
brought the cooler unit.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.268
It'll keep the petals fresh until

21:50.268 --> 21:52.437
we can get them back to
the lab on the mainland.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.647
- Shh!

21:53.647 --> 21:56.190
- Something wrong, Leilani?

21:56.232 --> 21:57.233
(creature growls)

21:57.275 --> 21:58.152
- What was that?

21:58.152 --> 22:00.445
- I don't know, is
everything okay, Leilani?

22:00.445 --> 22:01.572
- Yes, okay.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.327
- Oh my gosh.
- That them, Doctor?

22:07.368 --> 22:10.413
- Yes, it appears we've hit the jackpot.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.832
- Great!

22:11.832 --> 22:13.708
- Ladies?
- Yes, Leilani?

22:13.708 --> 22:15.543
- If you don't mind I'm
gonna step out for a minute.

22:15.585 --> 22:16.462
- Of course.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.422
Gimme your knife?

22:21.508 --> 22:24.552
Vicky, do you realize these
plants are only ever seen

22:24.593 --> 22:28.140
by intrepid adventurers who
hike through hip deep swampland

22:28.140 --> 22:28.973
to find them?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.975
- Isn't that exactly what we just did?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.395
- I suppose, gimme the cooler?

22:39.735 --> 22:41.737
(Leilani screams)

22:41.737 --> 22:43.197
- What was that?

22:43.197 --> 22:45.115
- Sounded like Leilani.

22:45.115 --> 22:45.990
- Leilani?

22:48.660 --> 22:50.078
Leilani?

22:50.078 --> 22:52.622
(eerie music)

22:52.663 --> 22:53.540
I don't know what's
going on here, but I say

22:53.540 --> 22:54.582
we get the hell out of here now.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.960
- I'm not going anywhere without
the rest of those orchids.

22:56.960 --> 22:57.793
- But--

22:57.835 --> 22:59.797
- I'm not leaving without these flowers.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.925
(dramatic music)

23:03.967 --> 23:06.218
(brush rustles)

23:06.260 --> 23:08.097
(creature hisses)

23:08.097 --> 23:09.555
- Oh my God.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.683
(creature growls)

23:11.683 --> 23:14.352
(dramatic music)

23:14.393 --> 23:16.688
(creature snarls)

23:16.688 --> 23:19.148
(girls whimper)

23:19.190 --> 23:22.735
(creature growls)

23:22.777 --> 23:23.903
- [Vicky] No!

23:35.290 --> 23:36.958
- Listen.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.918
Sorry about what happened
yesterday at the pool.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.797
- Seriously, you rubbing
lotion on another woman's

23:41.797 --> 23:44.382
half naked body is a great date.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.802
- Date, you said date,
you did, you said date,

23:46.802 --> 23:49.178
that was an official date, then.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.597
- First and last.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.017
- Come on, Rose, sleeping
beauty back there,

23:54.058 --> 23:55.185
she's not my type.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.520
She's just bored, she wanted somebody

23:56.520 --> 23:58.605
to pay attention to her.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.107
- Yeah.

24:00.107 --> 24:02.067
(Kimmy snorts)

24:02.067 --> 24:04.862
(idyllic music)

24:06.655 --> 24:09.490
- Nothing happened, I swear.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.955
Give me another chance,
I'll make it up to you, huh?

24:14.955 --> 24:17.748
That's a yes, that is a yes.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.667
- No, maybe.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.795
- It's a maybe, that's a
maybe then, I'll take maybe.

24:21.795 --> 24:24.588
- Look, we're 40 minutes late
thanks to this prima donna.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.632
(Kimmy yawns)

24:25.673 --> 24:27.758
- Don't worry about it,
Milo won't even notice.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.760
- Where the hell is Kimmy?

24:31.220 --> 24:32.805
- So sorry, Milo, we got
hung up at the hotel.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.473
It won't happen again.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.685
- Just get her in wardrobe,
we're already running late.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.687
And Bob's assistant, who
I hate, never showed.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.272
- You mean Deb.
- I mean Deb.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.567
Nobody's seen her since yesterday.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.152
- For the love of God, will
somebody get me a latte?

24:46.193 --> 24:48.028
- Let's go, let's go.
- Get her out of here.

24:48.905 --> 24:51.073
What the hell else can go wrong?

24:51.115 --> 24:52.242
And I'm getting dirty.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.995
Okay, you've just seen
your boyfriend slaughtered

24:56.037 --> 24:59.248
by a machete wielding maniac,
you're lost, you're scared--

24:59.290 --> 25:00.167
(Kimmy slurps)

25:00.167 --> 25:01.877
Kimmy, are you even listening to me?

25:01.877 --> 25:04.337
- Yeah, Milo, I get it,
I'm lost and scared.

25:04.378 --> 25:07.215
Can somebody get me another one of these?

25:07.215 --> 25:09.842
- After the next take, and it's Milo!

25:10.718 --> 25:13.305
Now let's do this thing,
all right, go, go.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.642
All right, people, while
we're young, let's get one

25:16.642 --> 25:17.725
in the can, let's go.

25:18.727 --> 25:19.560
- Wish me luck.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.773
(Rose sighs)

25:26.652 --> 25:29.362
- Head Chopper three, scene 37, take one.

25:29.403 --> 25:31.030
(marker clicks)

25:31.072 --> 25:32.990
- And action.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.577
- Oh my God, last thing
I knew, it killed Bruce

25:35.577 --> 25:38.330
and his head bounced on the
ground like a beach ball.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.373
- Shh, you're safe, Jerry's
out there hunting that maniac

25:40.373 --> 25:42.958
right now, I'm sure we're safe.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.085
- No!

25:44.127 --> 25:45.962
(knife slashes)
(Jack laughs evilly)

25:46.003 --> 25:47.713
(both scream)

25:47.755 --> 25:48.840
- Oh my God!

25:48.840 --> 25:50.050
(both scream)

25:50.050 --> 25:50.842
(head groans)

25:50.883 --> 25:51.843
- Help me.

25:51.843 --> 25:53.678
(both scream)

25:53.678 --> 25:55.555
- Not again!
- Help me.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.102
- No, cut, cut, cut, I hate it.

26:05.148 --> 26:05.982
(director sighs)

26:06.023 --> 26:08.402
Rachel, honey, a word, please.

26:08.402 --> 26:09.402
- Uh-huh?
- It's your scream.

26:09.443 --> 26:10.737
- What's wrong with it?

26:10.778 --> 26:12.613
- We need more?
- More what?

26:12.655 --> 26:17.160
- More emotion, more, just
give me more, okay, how's that?

26:17.160 --> 26:18.160
(phone rings)

26:18.202 --> 26:19.078
Whatever it is you're doing, do more.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.288
- Okay.

26:20.288 --> 26:21.122
- I gotta take this, why
don't you go practice a few

26:21.163 --> 26:23.082
before the next take,
and I'll take this call?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.708
- Okay, Milo.
- Great, thanks.

26:27.962 --> 26:28.922
- Talk to me.

26:30.715 --> 26:31.590
What?

26:33.552 --> 26:35.720
- I'm sure we're safe, Jerry is out there

26:35.720 --> 26:38.138
hunting that maniac right now.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.767
You have nothing to worry about.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.312
No, God, not again!

26:43.312 --> 26:46.563
Shh, you're safe, Jerry
is out there hunting

26:46.605 --> 26:49.275
that maniac right now, you
have nothing to worry about.

26:49.317 --> 26:52.778
No, God, not again! (fakes screaming)

26:57.450 --> 26:59.910
(creature growls)

26:59.952 --> 27:01.370
(dramatic music)

27:01.412 --> 27:03.038
(Rachel screams)

27:03.080 --> 27:07.002
(creature snarls)
(Rachel whimpers)

27:07.002 --> 27:09.878
(dramatic music)

27:16.845 --> 27:19.805
(creature growls)

27:21.725 --> 27:24.060
(creature roars)

27:24.060 --> 27:26.980
(Rachel whimpers)

27:28.272 --> 27:31.233
(creature growls)

27:32.485 --> 27:35.405
(Rachel whimpers)

27:37.115 --> 27:39.992
(Rachel screams)

27:41.452 --> 27:44.788
(creature roars)

27:44.830 --> 27:47.250
(both roar)

27:48.460 --> 27:50.962
- That, that's my actress,
I think she's finally

27:51.003 --> 27:53.632
learned how to scream,
but Morrie, come on,

27:53.632 --> 27:56.050
back to this call here, what's going on?

27:56.092 --> 27:57.927
- What's up with Milo?

27:57.968 --> 27:59.512
- I don't know, but
something must be wrong.

27:59.553 --> 28:02.265
- This is the last low budget movie I do.

28:06.143 --> 28:09.397
- That's fine, Morrie, but
my contract says pay or play,

28:09.438 --> 28:11.315
and guess what, you're paying.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.865
- Gunner.

28:18.865 --> 28:19.698
(men laugh)

28:19.740 --> 28:21.117
- Hey, city black.
- Look at you,

28:21.158 --> 28:22.077
look at you with all your toys,

28:22.077 --> 28:23.495
you got enough explosives here?

28:23.495 --> 28:25.455
- Yeah, no point in
being a pyrotechnics guy

28:25.455 --> 28:27.207
if you can't blow some stuff up.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.167
- I recognize this C4 detonator.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.000
What's the other thing?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.170
- These are blasting caps.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.588
All you gotta do, throw 'em on the ground

28:34.630 --> 28:35.882
and they'll explode.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.425
- Just throw 'em on the ground?

28:37.425 --> 28:38.927
- Throw 'em on the ground.

28:38.927 --> 28:39.760
- Just throw 'em on the ground.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.055
- No, not, no, not now.
(Jack laughs)

28:42.055 --> 28:45.475
- All right, everybody, listen
up, I got an announcement.

28:45.475 --> 28:47.477
One of the investors pulled
out of the production

28:47.477 --> 28:48.937
and the studio's shutting us down.

28:48.937 --> 28:50.605
- What about our checks?
- Are they good?

28:50.605 --> 28:53.148
- Checks are good, everyone's
gonna get paid, okay?

28:53.190 --> 28:55.985
Don't worry about it, we're
just shutting down, I'm sorry.

28:56.027 --> 28:57.153
(Jack groans)

28:57.153 --> 28:58.822
- Darn it!
- I'm outta here.

28:58.822 --> 28:59.780
- Not my fault.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.200
- I got a good mind to use this for real.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.535
- Yeah, yeah.

29:05.620 --> 29:08.288
(somber music)

29:23.178 --> 29:24.055
- Hey.

29:25.182 --> 29:27.267
(woman splashes)

29:27.267 --> 29:29.435
Gee, Jamie, what's your damage?

29:29.477 --> 29:31.687
- Oh, so you remember my name now?

29:31.728 --> 29:32.813
'Cause, like, you forgot it when

29:32.855 --> 29:34.523
miss B movie queen showed up.

29:34.565 --> 29:37.735
- They're not B movies,
they're exploitation films.

29:37.777 --> 29:38.737
I told you that.

29:38.737 --> 29:41.823
- You were gushing all over her
like some drooling teenager.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.658
(gasps) Are you Kimmy?

29:43.658 --> 29:46.118
- Okay, I was a little starstruck.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.453
Let me make it up to you.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.498
I've got a great place picked out.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.500
We'll have to hike a little
ways to get there, but.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.543
- Oh, well.

29:54.585 --> 29:57.338
I did just buy some new
cute hiking boots, but

29:57.338 --> 29:59.007
this is on the north side.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.675
Honey, that's the uninhabited
part of the island.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.553
I don't think it's safe.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.763
- Of course it's safe, this is Hawaii.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.598
Nothing bad ever happens in Hawaii.

30:09.142 --> 30:12.728
- Yeah, you're right, it's
the sunshine. (giggles)

30:12.770 --> 30:15.565
Let's do it. (giggles)

30:15.565 --> 30:18.233
(somber music)

30:33.123 --> 30:34.083
- What now?

30:36.920 --> 30:38.045
I'll be back.

30:45.387 --> 30:46.387
What's going on?

30:46.428 --> 30:47.347
- I don't know, let's find out.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.558
(somber music)

30:57.107 --> 30:58.817
You need some help?

30:58.817 --> 31:02.028
- No, but I'm afraid that you might.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.905
(dramatic music)

31:06.032 --> 31:08.743
- What's going on?
- Looks like a car broke down.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.373
- Freeze, hold it right there, ladies.

31:14.415 --> 31:15.917
(women gasp)

31:15.917 --> 31:19.753
- Move!

31:19.795 --> 31:20.630
- Move it.

31:22.965 --> 31:23.800
- Move!

31:25.092 --> 31:26.093
(women whimper)

31:26.135 --> 31:27.220
- Hey, go easy on her.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.597
(guns fire)
(women scream)

31:28.597 --> 31:29.722
- Enough!

31:29.763 --> 31:33.142
(Kimmy gasps in shock)

31:34.227 --> 31:37.605
You, my friend, you are the director, yes?

31:37.605 --> 31:38.480
- Uh-huh.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.110
- Well, Mr. 45 here has a change of plans

31:42.110 --> 31:44.987
and now, I am in charge, comprende?

31:47.532 --> 31:48.407
Very good.

31:49.283 --> 31:50.158
Now then.

31:51.160 --> 31:55.873
You all work for a very rich movie studio.

31:55.873 --> 31:59.460
I am quite certain that
they don't want any harm

31:59.502 --> 32:01.378
to come to any of their people.

32:01.420 --> 32:05.717
So they will meet our demands
and you all get to go home

32:05.717 --> 32:08.637
with no bullet holes in your head.

32:08.637 --> 32:12.640
This is a win-win for
everyone, yes, don't you think?

32:12.640 --> 32:15.560
(suspenseful music)

32:15.560 --> 32:17.520
(Gunner grunts)
(bomb explodes)

32:17.520 --> 32:18.855
- Go man, go, go, go!

32:18.855 --> 32:19.772
- Go, go get them!

32:19.813 --> 32:22.025
Don't kill them, shoot them in the ass!

32:22.983 --> 32:25.653
(Gunner pants)

32:27.613 --> 32:28.657
- Go, go!

32:28.657 --> 32:31.325
(dramatic music)

32:31.367 --> 32:33.160
- They're gonna shoot our asses!

32:33.202 --> 32:35.997
- Well, ass, head, we're
still gonna be dead, come on.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.460
- Now I assume that you
all have cell phones.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.045
Please, take them out,
hand them to Kazuto.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.550
(phone rings)

32:48.677 --> 32:53.263
Yes, boss, yes, we have
them, well, most of them.

32:55.392 --> 32:57.018
But I would not worry.

32:58.268 --> 33:00.813
I don't think they're going to go far.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.527
Okay.

33:05.527 --> 33:08.112
(eerie music)

33:10.490 --> 33:11.782
- Are we there yet?

33:11.823 --> 33:14.035
- I think the beach is just
about a quarter mile this way.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.245
- Who knows, that guide at
the pool could have given us

33:16.287 --> 33:17.622
good directions.

33:17.622 --> 33:19.873
- He probably just wanted us
to take one of his crazy tours.

33:19.915 --> 33:20.792
- Ugh.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.252
- Come on, let's hit it.

33:22.252 --> 33:23.502
- You said hit it, what?

33:24.795 --> 33:27.923
(suspenseful music)

33:31.677 --> 33:34.013
(men pant)

33:35.097 --> 33:36.265
- We gotta split up.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.558
- All right, later, Jay.

33:38.600 --> 33:42.063
(dramatic music)

33:42.063 --> 33:43.982
(Jack grunts)

33:43.982 --> 33:46.858
(dramatic music)

34:01.915 --> 34:04.168
(Jack grunts)

34:04.168 --> 34:05.962
(man grunts)

34:05.962 --> 34:08.882
(dramatic music)

34:08.882 --> 34:11.300
(gun fires)

34:18.766 --> 34:21.685
(creature snarls)

34:23.855 --> 34:25.982
(Jack pants)

34:25.982 --> 34:28.108
(creature roars)

34:28.150 --> 34:31.277
(suspenseful music)

34:39.828 --> 34:41.955
- Doesn't this beat staying in the room?

34:41.996 --> 34:43.331
- I suppose.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.752
- See, there's more to life
than playing video games.

34:45.752 --> 34:47.295
- Ha, like what, specifically?

34:48.712 --> 34:50.757
- Wait a second.
- What?

34:50.757 --> 34:52.132
- Did you hear something?

34:52.132 --> 34:54.135
- No.
- I know I heard something.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.137
In the bushes.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.765
- Stop it, stop trying to scare me.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.853
(Rose pants)

35:03.853 --> 35:05.395
- Arturo.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.815
- Miguel, why am I looking
only at one man here?

35:07.815 --> 35:10.067
Please do not tell me that
you let them get away.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.318
- I'm sorry, Arturo.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.028
- What's going on?
- Shh.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.990
- And where, may I ask, is
this genius partner of yours?

35:15.990 --> 35:17.492
- I haven't seen him since we split up,

35:17.492 --> 35:19.827
but I did find this off of the falls.

35:20.995 --> 35:21.870
- A video camera.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.332
Good, we can make a movie.

35:27.585 --> 35:28.793
- So what do we do now?

35:30.420 --> 35:31.297
- Now?

35:33.507 --> 35:35.802
I guess we take them to
go see the man, yeah?

35:38.428 --> 35:39.263
Come.

35:41.557 --> 35:42.892
Come, come.

35:42.892 --> 35:46.312
- You know, this is
kidnapping, really kidnapping.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.647
- Yes, I am aware of this, thank you.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.023
Why don't you just pretend

35:50.065 --> 35:51.983
that you are in one of your movies,

35:52.025 --> 35:54.653
yes, like the Hillbilly Hostage, hmm?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.322
- You saw Hillbilly Hostage?

35:56.322 --> 36:00.283
- Oh, indeed, it was
a truly terrible film.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.662
(Kimmy sighs)

36:03.703 --> 36:06.332
(eerie music)

36:10.502 --> 36:11.795
(camera beeps)

36:11.837 --> 36:13.172
- [Professor] You getting this?

36:13.213 --> 36:14.673
- [Assistant] I'm getting it all.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.675
(creature snarls)
(woman screams)

36:16.717 --> 36:19.303
(eerie music)

36:21.305 --> 36:22.765
- Dios mio.

36:22.765 --> 36:25.643
(dramatic music)

36:26.727 --> 36:29.272
- I am sweating like a pound puppy.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.148
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.650
- I think you're gonna
forgive me real soon.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.402
- Oh, really, is there
a mall around that bend?

36:34.402 --> 36:35.653
- Something even better.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.323
(idyllic music)

36:42.743 --> 36:45.412
- Honey, you weren't
kidding, it's so beautiful.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.872
- See, I told you.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.625
- Come on, let's go for a dip.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.920
(both laugh)

36:52.920 --> 36:58.133
I got you, hurry up! (squeals)

36:58.883 --> 37:00.637
Let's go, it's cold!

37:01.637 --> 37:04.098
(idyllic music)

37:04.098 --> 37:06.642
(both laugh)

37:07.560 --> 37:10.688
(suspenseful music)

37:29.290 --> 37:31.583
- Boss, there is
something you need to see.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.252
- First give me some good news.

37:37.465 --> 37:39.717
- We got the director, we
got the actress and we got

37:39.717 --> 37:42.637
that one, whoever the hell she is.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.097
- What happened there?

37:45.138 --> 37:46.432
- The guy tried to be a hero.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.058
- What about the others?

37:48.058 --> 37:51.020
- Listen, there is no time
for this, you have to see

37:51.020 --> 37:52.062
what is on here.

37:53.647 --> 37:54.565
- Gimme your gun.

37:55.775 --> 37:56.650
- What?

37:57.652 --> 37:59.028
- Your 45, give it to me.

38:03.157 --> 38:04.033
(man groans)

38:04.033 --> 38:05.827
When I ask a question, you answer.

38:08.162 --> 38:11.040
- Two of the prisoners
got away, JC is missing.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.458
I think he might be dead.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.375
- Why?

38:13.417 --> 38:15.460
- One of the men brought
this back from the falls.

38:15.502 --> 38:18.338
You take a look what's on
it, I think you'll know why.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.885
- Lock them up with the professor.

38:22.885 --> 38:25.680
All right, let's see
what's so damn important.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.265
(eerie music)

38:29.850 --> 38:33.103
- Bad boy! (squeals)

38:34.438 --> 38:36.065
(both sigh)

38:36.065 --> 38:37.525
(Jamie laughs)

38:37.525 --> 38:38.733
- Still pissed at me?

38:38.775 --> 38:40.402
- Nah, it's hard to stay mad

38:40.443 --> 38:42.028
in a place as beautiful as this.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.363
- Good, 'cause there's a little something

38:43.405 --> 38:45.282
I'd love for you to do for me.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.035
- Ricky, whatever did you have in mind?

38:48.035 --> 38:51.413
- First, hold the fort,
I gotta water the plants.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.332
- You're such a geek.

38:53.373 --> 38:54.583
- I'll be right back.

38:54.583 --> 38:59.088
- No, take your time, I'm just
gonna go for another swim.

38:59.088 --> 39:04.302
- Okay!
(Jamie groans)

39:05.720 --> 39:09.098
(eerie music)

39:09.098 --> 39:11.725
(zipper zips)

39:14.312 --> 39:17.063
(water trickles)

39:17.105 --> 39:19.567
(creature growls)

39:19.567 --> 39:22.152
(eerie music)

39:26.740 --> 39:30.452
(water trickles)
(gravel rustles)

39:30.493 --> 39:33.372
(man screams)
(creature snarls)

39:33.413 --> 39:36.292
(dramatic music)

39:41.088 --> 39:41.963
- Rick?

39:43.007 --> 39:46.135
(suspenseful music)

39:54.768 --> 39:55.643
Rick?

39:58.980 --> 40:00.190
Where are you?

40:04.237 --> 40:08.823
Rick, if you're punking me,
consider yourself single!

40:16.415 --> 40:17.248
Heck?

40:19.418 --> 40:22.630
(footsteps approach)

40:24.507 --> 40:27.593
- Come on, move it, let's go.

40:28.552 --> 40:29.428
- Coming.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.765
(Professor chuckles)

40:32.765 --> 40:34.308
- One big happy family.

40:36.727 --> 40:38.645
(Rose sighs)

40:38.687 --> 40:41.023
(suspenseful music)

40:41.023 --> 40:41.898
- Rick?

40:46.612 --> 40:48.572
- You getting this?
- I'm getting it all.

40:48.613 --> 40:49.740
It's fantastic.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.328
It's just like you said.

40:56.622 --> 40:59.667
(professor laughs)

41:01.793 --> 41:03.420
(creature snarls)
(blood splatters)

41:03.462 --> 41:04.338
- Stop.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.257
(camera beeps)

41:06.257 --> 41:07.675
Run it back from there.

41:07.675 --> 41:10.385
(tape rewinds)

41:12.220 --> 41:15.223
(creature snarls)
(blood spatters)

41:15.265 --> 41:16.392
(camera beeps)
(tape rewinds)

41:16.392 --> 41:18.977
- You see, that crazy scientist did it.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.728
He was telling the truth.

41:20.770 --> 41:22.732
We need to get out of here right now.

41:23.857 --> 41:24.900
(camera beeps)

41:24.900 --> 41:30.113
(creature snarls)
(blood spatters)

41:31.448 --> 41:32.448
- Pike, what is it?

41:35.743 --> 41:37.037
- This is no turtle egg.

41:38.872 --> 41:42.292
- Dios mio, it came out
of that thing, didn't it?

41:43.377 --> 41:44.253
- Please, come on.

41:44.253 --> 41:47.297
- Hey, I hate snakes, okay, you know that.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.467
- We're not dealing with snakes.

41:49.467 --> 41:51.052
(man speaks Spanish)

41:51.052 --> 41:52.468
- Something much worse.

41:53.678 --> 41:57.015
It's like an unholy
union between a piranha

41:57.057 --> 41:58.642
and an anaconda.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.185
- You mean a piranhaconda.

42:03.355 --> 42:06.150
- I can't believe you just said that.

42:06.150 --> 42:07.985
- Guys, please just get rid of this thing

42:07.985 --> 42:10.820
before that other one
comes sniffing around here.

42:12.657 --> 42:14.408
- You know what, Pike, maybe he's right,

42:14.408 --> 42:16.285
I mean, we have lost a guy already.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.413
- This could be worth a fortune

42:19.413 --> 42:21.707
and I never leave money behind.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.625
- What about the ransom?

42:23.667 --> 42:26.087
- We stick to the plan, I don't
care if it's Satan himself

42:26.087 --> 42:28.838
in that jungle, I don't
leave until I get paid.

42:33.385 --> 42:36.013
(eerie music)

42:44.062 --> 42:47.900
(engine fails to turn over)

42:54.532 --> 42:56.158
- Don't bother.

42:56.158 --> 42:58.535
They took the distributor cap.

42:58.577 --> 43:00.955
It's like they didn't
want us going for help.

43:00.955 --> 43:04.123
- (sighs) I'm glad you're alive.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.500
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

43:06.377 --> 43:09.170
So what do you want to do?

43:09.212 --> 43:11.757
- Well, we go back the
way we came, it's 14 miles

43:11.757 --> 43:12.548
back to the highway.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.467
- Uh-huh.

43:14.510 --> 43:17.553
- We follow these treads,
go looking for trouble.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.640
- Lemme get some supplies.

43:20.682 --> 43:22.810
- Hey, Gunner, there's one more thing.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.022
- That guy that was chasing me?

43:26.022 --> 43:30.233
It sounded like something
got him, some kinda animal.

43:30.275 --> 43:32.485
- Animal, what kind of animal?

43:32.527 --> 43:34.488
- Like nothing I've ever heard before.

43:36.907 --> 43:38.950
- Well, I'll get more supplies.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.588
(director groans)

43:51.588 --> 43:55.758
- Why would anybody want to
kidnap a low budget movie crew?

43:55.800 --> 43:58.053
- MGM recently bought our studio.

43:58.053 --> 43:59.972
They've got deep pockets.

43:59.972 --> 44:02.975
- Of course, MGM could
decide not to pay a cent.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.312
Hey, Kimmy, kinda curious, how big

44:06.312 --> 44:08.730
is the studio's insurance policy on you?

44:08.772 --> 44:11.192
- Lock it up, Milo, they'll pay.

44:11.192 --> 44:12.818
- It's Milo!

44:12.818 --> 44:15.820
- Whatever, when I get back,
I'm going on Oprah and Leno,

44:15.862 --> 44:17.238
the whole talk show circuit.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.282
This is exactly what my career needed.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.493
- Unless our illustrious
host decides to put

44:22.535 --> 44:23.703
a bullet in your head.

44:23.745 --> 44:26.165
- You know, you're a long
way from the university,

44:26.165 --> 44:28.500
Professor, what are you doing out here?

44:28.542 --> 44:32.003
- Honey, if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

44:32.045 --> 44:33.255
- Why don't you try us?

44:34.338 --> 44:38.885
- When I was a kid, my dad
worked for Santiago oil company.

44:38.927 --> 44:41.388
Him and the whole crew
went into the jungle,

44:41.388 --> 44:44.975
never came out, lot of
rumors started to circulate

44:44.975 --> 44:46.977
and people got kind of scared.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.105
A few more disappeared and then

44:51.565 --> 44:53.650
everything stopped, all of
a sudden, just like that,

44:53.692 --> 44:57.028
real quiet for 50 years.

44:59.197 --> 45:03.868
Then two weeks ago, a
tour group disappeared.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.745
- Oh my God, I read about
that on the internet.

45:05.787 --> 45:06.663
- Yeah.

45:07.915 --> 45:09.875
Well, it's true, you know.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.042
Something in the river.

45:12.085 --> 45:13.087
Something big.

45:13.920 --> 45:14.922
Something bad.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.883
Something that likes to eat people.

45:19.593 --> 45:21.137
- (scoffs) Are you on crack?

45:22.512 --> 45:25.390
- Okay, my friends, on
your feet, everybody,

45:25.432 --> 45:27.142
outside, let's move.

45:27.183 --> 45:31.313
Ah, no, no, no, you,
lizard man, you can stay.

45:32.730 --> 45:33.982
Come, let's go outside.

45:40.530 --> 45:41.573
Come.

45:41.573 --> 45:44.702
(suspenseful music)

45:58.757 --> 46:01.092
All right, stop, that's far enough.

46:02.928 --> 46:04.345
- You, hold this.

46:06.182 --> 46:07.390
- What's going on?

46:07.432 --> 46:10.060
- That's today's paper,
proves that we're still alive.

46:10.060 --> 46:11.478
(man speaks Spanish)

46:11.478 --> 46:13.730
- Everyone, on your knees, please.

46:14.898 --> 46:17.860
(director groans)

46:19.695 --> 46:22.238
(camera beeps)

46:22.280 --> 46:25.117
- We have your people, if
you ever want to see them

46:25.117 --> 46:28.328
alive again, you will deposit
$3 million into an account

46:28.328 --> 46:29.872
which I shall name later.

46:30.788 --> 46:35.127
If you do not comply, we
will mail you their heads,

46:35.127 --> 46:40.340
one by one, you have 24
hours to think it over.

46:40.757 --> 46:42.968
(camera beeps)

46:42.968 --> 46:45.012
- All right, got it.

46:45.012 --> 46:48.265
(eerie music)

46:48.265 --> 46:50.808
- Can't you see this man
needs medical attention?

46:53.270 --> 46:55.063
- You should worry about yourself.

46:58.650 --> 47:00.443
- Okay, people, on your feet.

47:02.112 --> 47:02.988
(director groans)

47:02.988 --> 47:03.822
Come on, move it.

47:03.863 --> 47:06.367
Or maybe you want us to
shoot the other foot, yes?

47:07.868 --> 47:09.285
- I have to pee.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.747
- Miguel, watch these two.

47:11.747 --> 47:13.165
You, come.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.960
(eerie music)

47:29.222 --> 47:30.265
Here you go.

47:31.392 --> 47:33.018
Pick a bush, don't be shy.

47:34.185 --> 47:35.645
- I don't really need to go.

47:36.938 --> 47:37.813
- Oh really?

47:38.898 --> 47:41.818
Then why don't you tell me
what it is that you do need?

47:42.693 --> 47:44.988
- Your word that you
won't hurt anyone else.

47:46.448 --> 47:48.492
- I could maybe do this
for you, but what are you

47:48.492 --> 47:50.577
going to do for me in return?

47:57.458 --> 48:00.295
- Okay, wait, slow down, okay? (pants)

48:00.295 --> 48:03.673
- Sure, we can take our time, yes, mmm.

48:07.135 --> 48:08.470
(man groans)

48:08.470 --> 48:11.682
(dramatic music)

48:11.682 --> 48:13.683
- Arturo, what happened?

48:13.683 --> 48:17.353
- That loco chica, she was
playing kickball with my cojones.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.815
- You want I should go after her?

48:19.815 --> 48:22.775
- No, I want you to stand
here asking me questions.

48:22.817 --> 48:23.693
Yes, go.

48:23.693 --> 48:25.278
- Can I wear Pike's mask?

48:25.278 --> 48:27.155
- I don't care if you wear
flip flops and a speedo.

48:27.197 --> 48:28.073
Go get her!

48:29.867 --> 48:30.908
- Ain't you coming?

48:30.950 --> 48:34.955
- No, I'm gonna stay here
in case she doubles back.

48:37.582 --> 48:40.043
Can't believe he's wearing that mask.

48:40.043 --> 48:42.920
(dramatic music)

48:56.852 --> 48:59.312
- Come back here, you little witch.

49:00.397 --> 49:03.192
(Rose whimpers)

49:07.695 --> 49:08.947
You're dead!

49:08.988 --> 49:12.200
(dramatic music)

49:12.242 --> 49:13.952
I know you're there.

49:13.993 --> 49:16.872
(dramatic music)

49:28.592 --> 49:30.427
(man growls)

49:30.427 --> 49:32.803
(Rose sobs)

49:32.845 --> 49:35.682
(dramatic music)

49:42.480 --> 49:45.275
You're gonna die, girl,
you're gonna die! (growls)

49:45.275 --> 49:48.153
(dramatic music)

49:54.408 --> 49:55.368
Stop there!

49:56.243 --> 50:01.458
I'll get you. (growls)

50:01.667 --> 50:02.500
I got you.

50:03.460 --> 50:05.962
(Rose pants)

50:11.385 --> 50:13.887
(Rose yelps)

50:19.517 --> 50:20.893
- So do you think they'll pay?

50:22.187 --> 50:24.105
- Well, either they will or they won't.

50:24.147 --> 50:26.273
- Wow, what keen insight.

50:26.315 --> 50:27.567
You know, it's a good thing I plucked you

50:27.608 --> 50:30.570
from that strip joint before
you rose to fame in Vegas.

50:30.612 --> 50:32.988
My world would be at
such a loss without you.

50:34.115 --> 50:34.992
Ow!

50:36.242 --> 50:39.328
Anybody else had done that,
they'd have a hole right here.

50:39.370 --> 50:42.207
- Yeah, well, your gun's
all the way over there.

50:42.248 --> 50:45.043
(Pike chuckles)

50:47.212 --> 50:49.798
(phone rings)

50:52.717 --> 50:53.593
- What is it?

50:53.593 --> 50:55.387
- Sorry, boss, I have some bad news.

50:55.387 --> 50:56.555
- I hate bad news.

50:59.473 --> 51:02.227
(ominous music)

51:09.985 --> 51:12.945
(man pants)

51:12.987 --> 51:15.865
- All right, time to die!

51:15.907 --> 51:18.285
- You can't, the ransom, remember?

51:18.285 --> 51:20.037
(creature growls)

51:20.037 --> 51:22.788
- You're just the script
girl, who's gonna miss you?

51:24.082 --> 51:29.295
(creature growls)
(dramatic music)

51:29.628 --> 51:32.465
(creature roars)

51:38.555 --> 51:40.348
- Dammit, Arturo, I can't
believe you let her get away.

51:40.348 --> 51:41.933
Why didn't you go after her?

51:41.933 --> 51:46.522
- You kidding me, go after
her, with that freak out there?

51:46.522 --> 51:47.397
- Help!

51:48.857 --> 51:53.403
Help, oh my God, it's out
there, it's out there,

51:53.403 --> 51:54.320
it ate him!

51:54.362 --> 51:56.280
- We know, we know, get her
back in there with the others.

51:56.322 --> 51:57.657
- He's dead!

51:57.698 --> 52:00.577
(dramatic music)

52:13.130 --> 52:16.258
- What is that place?
- Some kind of mill?

52:16.300 --> 52:17.593
Been dead for a while by the looks of it.

52:17.635 --> 52:21.138
You got binoculars?
- Yeah, yeah, here.

52:22.140 --> 52:24.935
(ominous music)

52:26.310 --> 52:27.312
(Jack sighs)

52:27.353 --> 52:28.230
- They got Rose.

52:28.230 --> 52:29.063
- Is she okay?

52:30.398 --> 52:31.398
- She looks scared.

52:33.777 --> 52:35.028
- What's the plan, Jack?

52:38.948 --> 52:40.533
- I don't know.

52:40.533 --> 52:41.827
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

52:41.827 --> 52:42.785
- (scoffs) Well.

52:43.912 --> 52:46.748
As long as I get to blow
some stuff up, I'm okay.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.417
- I think we can work that out.

52:49.458 --> 52:50.293
- Eh.

52:51.210 --> 52:53.547
- Aw, come on.
(Rose grunts)

52:53.547 --> 52:55.673
Thought you could swim
away, huh, little fishie?

52:55.715 --> 52:58.510
(Rose whimpers)

52:59.970 --> 53:03.055
Maybe next time I don't throw you back.

53:07.310 --> 53:08.353
- Rose.

53:08.353 --> 53:09.187
(Rose sobs)

53:09.228 --> 53:10.605
Rose, are you with us, darling?

53:11.607 --> 53:14.692
- He's telling the truth,
there's something out there

53:14.733 --> 53:17.653
that's worse than those kidnappers.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.155
- Well, what is it?

53:19.197 --> 53:21.575
- I don't know. (sobs)

53:21.575 --> 53:26.120
It's like this giant snake,
but it's not a snake, man.

53:26.162 --> 53:28.332
- It's an evolutionary line jumper.

53:28.332 --> 53:30.042
- In layman's terms?

53:30.042 --> 53:32.585
- It's a random mutation of enormous size.

53:33.712 --> 53:35.505
A hybrid with keen senses.

53:35.505 --> 53:37.757
Put simply, it's probably
the most dangerous predator

53:37.798 --> 53:41.427
ever known to mankind, I've
been hunting that damn thing

53:41.468 --> 53:42.553
for 20 years.

53:44.597 --> 53:45.557
I finally found it.

53:47.642 --> 53:48.518
(Kimmy snorts)

53:48.518 --> 53:50.437
- You guys are cuckoo for psycho puffs.

53:50.437 --> 53:52.272
If there was something out there,

53:52.272 --> 53:54.607
it'd be on National Geographic or YouTube.

53:54.648 --> 53:57.110
- Not if it evolved to avoid detection,

53:57.110 --> 53:59.695
burrowing under the ground
and going into some sort

53:59.737 --> 54:02.407
of state of hibernation, coming out

54:02.448 --> 54:06.745
every once in a while to fill its belly.

54:07.870 --> 54:10.915
- That's not all it does. (pants)

54:12.875 --> 54:15.670
I fell into its nest of eggs.

54:15.670 --> 54:18.423
(ominous music)

54:30.560 --> 54:32.228
- Freeze right there.

54:32.228 --> 54:33.563
- Please don't shoot.

54:33.563 --> 54:36.065
(man grunts)

54:37.775 --> 54:38.652
Whoa.

54:40.945 --> 54:41.988
- Here you go.

54:41.988 --> 54:42.863
- No, I don't do guns.

54:42.905 --> 54:44.407
Hey, you were a Marine, right?

54:44.448 --> 54:45.325
- Right outta high school.

54:45.325 --> 54:46.492
- Tell me you were some
kind of force recon

54:46.533 --> 54:47.452
badass or something.

54:47.493 --> 54:49.328
- No, motor pool badass.

54:49.370 --> 54:50.247
- Motor pool.

54:50.247 --> 54:52.332
- Ready to do this?
- Hell no.

54:52.332 --> 54:53.667
Let's do it anyway.

54:53.667 --> 54:56.543
(dramatic music)

54:58.170 --> 55:00.882
(bomb beeps)

55:00.923 --> 55:02.925
(gun fires)
(man grunts)

55:02.967 --> 55:06.470
(dramatic music)

55:06.512 --> 55:07.472
- What was that?

55:07.472 --> 55:08.723
- Trouble, let's go.

55:09.682 --> 55:12.560
(dramatic music)

55:15.022 --> 55:17.565
(bomb beeps)

55:19.150 --> 55:21.193
(gun fires)

55:21.235 --> 55:24.113
(dramatic music)

55:28.368 --> 55:31.578
(bomb beeps)

55:31.620 --> 55:33.038
- Hey there, you guys missed me?

55:33.080 --> 55:34.957
- Jack, you're alive.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.167
(bomb beeps)

55:36.208 --> 55:39.087
(dramatic music)

55:40.047 --> 55:40.880
- Who's this guy?

55:40.922 --> 55:44.008
- We'll explain later, let's
get outta here, thanks.

55:44.008 --> 55:46.887
(dramatic music)

55:56.395 --> 55:57.397
- I'm so happy to see you.

55:57.397 --> 55:59.065
I thought it got you.

55:59.065 --> 56:00.650
- Thought what got me?

56:00.650 --> 56:02.027
(guns fire)
(all gasp)

56:02.027 --> 56:03.152
Come on, this way.

56:03.193 --> 56:06.030
(dramatic music)

56:10.827 --> 56:13.287
Okay, we're gonna head
for those SUVs out there.

56:14.247 --> 56:15.123
You know how to use this?

56:15.123 --> 56:18.333
- Yeah, learned that on the
set of Die, Charlie, Die,

56:18.375 --> 56:19.210
but I should have the machine gun.

56:19.252 --> 56:20.420
That's 50 yards of open ground out there.

56:20.420 --> 56:22.338
You'll never make it alive,

56:22.338 --> 56:23.798
not without someone covering you.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.675
- No, Milo, we're not leaving you.

56:25.675 --> 56:28.177
- And I can't make that
run, so either we all

56:28.218 --> 56:30.180
stay here and die together
or I give the rest of you

56:30.180 --> 56:31.555
a fighting chance.

56:31.597 --> 56:33.433
- A good thought.

56:33.433 --> 56:34.808
- What do you think?

56:34.850 --> 56:37.478
(eerie music)

56:40.690 --> 56:42.608
- Good luck, let's go.

56:47.738 --> 56:51.325
- And now here's something
the whole family can enjoy.

56:51.367 --> 56:54.245
(dramatic music)

56:58.917 --> 57:01.377
(guns fire)

57:24.150 --> 57:25.025
- Almost got it.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.653
- Almost isn't good enough, we gotta go.

57:27.695 --> 57:28.947
- Get the hell outta here!

57:28.947 --> 57:34.160
(guns fire)
(creature snarls)

57:35.118 --> 57:37.247
(creature roars)

57:37.247 --> 57:38.790
- We gotta bigger problem.

57:38.790 --> 57:41.583
(guns fire)

57:41.625 --> 57:42.793
- Oh!

57:42.835 --> 57:45.255
(guns fire)

57:48.465 --> 57:50.008
I've got this.

57:50.050 --> 57:52.220
(guns fire)

57:52.220 --> 57:54.805
(creature snarls)

57:54.847 --> 57:57.725
(dramatic music)

57:58.893 --> 58:00.018
- No!

58:00.060 --> 58:02.147
(Kimmy screams)

58:02.147 --> 58:04.940
(mill explodes)

58:08.235 --> 58:10.697
(Kimmy screams)

58:10.697 --> 58:12.115
- Gunner!

58:12.115 --> 58:15.660
(dramatic music)

58:15.660 --> 58:18.622
(creature snarls)

58:19.580 --> 58:21.290
(jazzy music)

58:21.332 --> 58:25.002
- On it, no more, what happened to Gunner?

58:25.962 --> 58:28.463
(rock music)

58:29.382 --> 58:30.925
- He's gone, Rose, he's gone.

58:34.303 --> 58:37.182

59:03.792 --> 59:05.710

59:05.710 --> 59:08.045

59:08.087 --> 59:09.172
- It's real! (sobs)

59:09.172 --> 59:10.005
It's really real.

59:10.047 --> 59:11.967
- I tried to tell you that.

59:11.967 --> 59:13.593
It grew at a hyper
accelerated growth rate,

59:13.593 --> 59:16.220
it's capable of anything,
it's a genetic freak.

59:16.262 --> 59:19.848

59:20.892 --> 59:22.852
Give me the short answer.

59:36.950 --> 59:37.950
(Rose sobs)

59:37.992 --> 59:40.703
- That thing is way too fast for a snake.

59:40.703 --> 59:42.705
- Why is it chasing us?

59:42.705 --> 59:45.792

- I doubt it, that creature hunts

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.772
with a predatory sense of smell.

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:11.567
(rock music)

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:14.153

(Jack pants)

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.335
- We're so dead.

01:00:29.335 --> 01:00:30.378
- Be quiet.

01:00:30.378 --> 01:00:32.297
- I won't get to be on Oprah.

01:00:32.297 --> 01:00:34.507
- I'm working on it.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:37.385
(dramatic music)

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.310

got something for you.

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:49.230
(dramatic music)

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.573
(Jack grunts)

01:01:00.867 --> 01:01:02.868
(bazooka blasts)

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.372
- What are you doing, Jack?

01:01:05.372 --> 01:01:06.955
- What are you doing?

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.460
(brakes screech)
(bazooka explodes)

(Kimmy screams)

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:20.218
- Ew! (laughs)

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.223
- Thank you Jack, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:26.767
(both laugh)

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:30.772
(dramatic music)

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:36.110
(creatures snarl)

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:42.200
- What's wrong?

01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:45.118
- We're almost on empty.

01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:48.957
(dramatic music)

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:59.842
A bullet must've hit the
gas tank, we got lucky.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.803
- Excuse me, how is this possibly lucky?

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.763
- Because we didn't die
in a fiery explosion.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.890
We're too exposed on this road.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:09.602
- I think there's a marina
out there in the jungle.

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:11.812
Maybe we can get a boat.

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.565
- From here, I'm not sure.

01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:17.568
If we follow the river
south, maybe we'll find it.

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:18.987
- Aren't we forgetting something?

01:02:18.987 --> 01:02:21.447
This isn't chicken yolk,
all right, that thing

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:22.865
is laying eggs out there.

01:02:22.865 --> 01:02:25.452
- This day just keeps
getting better and better.

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:27.412
- What's wrong?

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:32.208
- (laughs) Think back to your
sex ed classes, Ms. Weston.

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:34.460
Takes two to make an egg.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.878
- There could be another one.

01:02:35.878 --> 01:02:37.505
- It doesn't matter, if
we stay on this road,

01:02:37.505 --> 01:02:39.590
those kidnappers are
gonna find us for sure.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.675
We gotta risk it.

01:02:40.675 --> 01:02:43.260
(eerie music)

01:02:53.897 --> 01:02:54.897
- So what happened?

01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:58.943
- (sighs) The monster's dead,
and so is this crap machine.

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:02.070
- You sure that thing is
dead, because I watched

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.615
about 10,000 rounds bounce off its hide

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:09.537
like they were freaking tic-tacs.

01:03:09.537 --> 01:03:11.872
Okay, good, so now what?

01:03:13.082 --> 01:03:14.292
- So now we go after 'em.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:20.923
- Listen, Pike, I think maybe
we've gone far enough, yeah?

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:24.843
It's just time to let it go.

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.762
- Talia died screaming.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:29.598
We're not gonna rest
until they're all dead.

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:37.690
(Arturo speaks Spanish)

01:03:39.192 --> 01:03:42.445
(director groans)

01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:45.030
(eerie music)

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:12.392
(director grunts)

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.645
(phone beeps)

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:21.150
(phone rings)

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:26.363
(ringtone plays)
(creature snarls)

01:04:30.827 --> 01:04:32.412
- [Voicemail] Hi, Rick here, I'm in Hawaii

01:04:32.412 --> 01:04:35.413
for the next week enjoying
the wildlife, leave a message.

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:42.128
(phone beeps)
(Jamie scoffs)

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.047
- Hey, lady?

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:47.175
- Jeeze, what happened to you?

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.972
- Oh, not much, I hurt my foot,
do you have a car somewhere?

01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:53.015
- Do I look like I have a freaking car?

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:54.975
- What's wrong?

01:04:56.018 --> 01:04:58.812
- (sobs) My boyfriend,
he dragged me out here

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.523
to this beach because he
said it was gonna be romantic

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.775
and then (sobs) he just disappeared

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:08.572
and I don't know, maybe the
jungle swallowed him up or--

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:15.997
- No, lady, you don't
understand, it's not the jungle.

01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:17.832
- What are you talking about?

01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:21.877
- There's a creature out
there, like a huge snake

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.045
or something, I don't know, all I know

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.338
is that it hunts people.

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:28.675
- Um, Mister, um...

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.387
I think you need some help.

01:05:32.472 --> 01:05:34.390
- No, no, we both need help, listen to me.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.850
- No, Rick, Rick?

01:05:39.187 --> 01:05:40.145
Rick, Rick!

01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:43.898
- This is why I don't get married.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.443
- Rick, where are you, honey?

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.405
(director groans)

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.407
Rick, Rick?

01:05:54.035 --> 01:05:55.327
Honey, come on.

01:05:56.495 --> 01:05:57.455
Rick, Rick?

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.335
(director groans)

01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:06.422
(unsettling music)

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:22.855
- I could really use a drink.

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:27.610
- It's over here.

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:34.908
Fresh water.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.537
- Thank you.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:42.958
- It's good, huh?

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:46.587
- (sighs) It's good.

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:49.215
- Everything got so
crazy, I didn't tell you

01:06:49.215 --> 01:06:52.385
I'm sorry about Gunner, he was a good guy.

01:06:52.385 --> 01:06:54.178
- Yeah, he was a good guy.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.890
You got yolk all over your shirt.

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:03.187
- It's sticky, I can't get it off.

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:05.355
- Take this, okay?

01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:08.983
(romantic music)

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.445
(Rose grunts)

01:07:11.445 --> 01:07:13.613
- Why are you smiling?

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:14.948
- I got you out of your
top and it's not even

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.867
our second date.

01:07:15.867 --> 01:07:19.078
- Oh, really, you think you're
gonna get a second date?

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:20.747
- I like my chances.

01:07:20.747 --> 01:07:23.373
- Get us outta here alive and we'll talk.

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:27.837
(Jack chuckles)

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:31.548
(director grunts)

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:34.135
(eerie music)

01:07:47.607 --> 01:07:50.483
(dramatic music)

01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:52.778
- Mmm.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:59.075
(director coughs)

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.665
- Oh, you're on the hate list.

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:10.420
- Oh my gosh, what is all this? (grunts)

01:08:10.462 --> 01:08:13.215
(ominous music)

01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:23.350
- Lady.
(Jamie gasps)

01:08:23.392 --> 01:08:24.602
- Stay away from me.

01:08:24.602 --> 01:08:26.978
- No, you don't understand, you and I

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.064
are in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:08:30.983 --> 01:08:31.942
- You're crazy.

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:36.447
- No, that creature I told
you about, this is its nest!

01:08:36.447 --> 01:08:39.200
(ominous music)

01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:43.953
- You mean--

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:44.830
- Yeah, I mean.

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:47.832
(Jamie gasps)

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.292
- What are you doing?

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.335
(Jamie screams)

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:53.296
Lady, stop it, let's just get outta here!

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:56.008
(Jamie grunts)

01:08:57.258 --> 01:08:58.635
(creature snarls)

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:03.890
(dramatic music)
(Jamie screams)

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.018
(creature roars)

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:14.734
(Jamie screams)

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:17.654
(creature growls)

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:25.703
(Jamie screams)
(creature snarls)

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.460
- God, there really is another
one out there, isn't there?

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.587
- It sounds close.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:36.256
- Yeah, a little too close.

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:37.256
(gun cocks)

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:39.050
Let's keep going.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.932
(ominous music)

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.064
- You can drink when they're all dead

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.902
and not a second before.
- Sorry.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:02.700
(creature snarls in the distance)

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.493
(ominous music)

01:10:17.005 --> 01:10:19.048
- The hell is this?

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.258
- If I live through this, I'm making up

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.718
for every bad thing I've ever done.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.512
- That's a whole lot, isn't it, hon?

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:24.430
- Bitch.

01:10:26.932 --> 01:10:27.975
- Wait, what's this?

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.020
- That's mine, that's what it is.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.272
- No, this is the egg I saw in the jungle.

01:10:34.773 --> 01:10:36.067
- When we escaped from those kidnappers,

01:10:36.067 --> 01:10:37.442
that thing went after us.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.027
Lots of easy prey around and it went after

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.612
a speeding SUV?

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.030
- What are you suggesting?

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:46.285
- It wasn't going after us,
it was going after this.

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:48.412
- You said yourself it
has hyper acute senses.

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.622
It was tracking us because of this egg.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.207
- What are you gonna do, kill it?

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:55.168
They're a species unknown to mankind.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.045
Needs to be studied, Jack.

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:58.338
- You put all of our lives at risk

01:10:58.338 --> 01:10:59.423
by bringing this along.

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:00.298
- I guess I did.

01:11:01.425 --> 01:11:03.677
- We're not bringing it
back to civilization.

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.887
You get in the boat with Kim,
you go back to the docks,

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.180
bring the authorities.

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:08.557
- Where are you going, Jack?

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:12.102
- The movie vans are close.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.812
Some of Gunner's pyrotechnics are inside.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:16.357
Get back in the boat with
Kimmy, go to the docks,

01:11:16.357 --> 01:11:17.190
get the authorities.

01:11:17.232 --> 01:11:20.277
- No, I'm staying with
you, you need my help.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:21.195
- Fine.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.907
- This I gotta see. (chuckles)

01:11:24.907 --> 01:11:26.658
- Hey, where are you guys going?

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:30.703
Hello, did anyone bring any sunscreen?

01:11:31.997 --> 01:11:34.792
No, are we still going on the boat?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.630
Why is professor creepy taking
notes like we're some kind

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:41.465
of lab animals? (sighs)

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:43.967
(bass music)

01:11:48.263 --> 01:11:50.140
- I don't trust him.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.017
- No, me neither.

01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:54.645
He might come in handy, though.

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:59.608
- Your trap, it reminds me of something.

01:11:59.608 --> 01:12:00.317
- You don't remember?

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:02.152
- It's been a long day, Jack.

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.363
- I got the idea from the
Head Chopper two script,

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:06.532
after our killer eviscerates
the motocross rider.

01:12:06.532 --> 01:12:09.410
- Right, right, Kimmy uses
the head chopper's childhood

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:10.618
teddy bear--

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:15.582
- And lures him into a
fireworks factor, and boom,

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:16.958
big old Hollywood explosion.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.002
- Sounds dicey.

01:12:18.002 --> 01:12:20.337
- Well, it is dicey, worked in the movie.

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:21.463
- Doesn't mean it's gonna work here.

01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:25.133
- In case you haven't noticed,
we're running outta options.

01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:27.803
- You could've gone for
help, but you didn't.

01:12:27.803 --> 01:12:29.555
You came back and searched for us.

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:32.933
- There's no way I was
gonna leave you behind.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:35.768
Couldn't let anything happen to you.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:39.063
- Thank you for saving me.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:41.108
- Well, that's how I roll, baby.

01:12:41.108 --> 01:12:42.358
(both laugh)

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.777
(gun fires)
(Jack groans)

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.238
(Kimmy screams)

01:12:46.238 --> 01:12:47.280
- Run, run!

01:12:47.322 --> 01:12:49.700
- Yeah, that's it, run, that
way it'll be more like sport.

01:12:51.827 --> 01:12:54.830
- You kill them, you can
say goodbye to your ransom.

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.957
- This isn't about money anymore.

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:59.125
That thing killed the
only woman I ever loved

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:00.668
and you brought it on.

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.257
This won't make us even,
but it'll be a start.

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:06.133
(creature snarls in distance)

01:13:06.133 --> 01:13:07.008
- Wait.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:09.637
Did you hear that?

01:13:12.932 --> 01:13:14.223
- Hear what?

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:16.185
- Listen, man, I can kill that thing.

01:13:16.185 --> 01:13:19.228
I got a detonator in
here and I can kill it.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.855
- Maybe it can't hear us.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:22.565
- It doesn't need to hear us.

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:29.155
(Kimmy whimpers)

01:13:29.197 --> 01:13:30.907
- Guess it was nothing.

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:34.118
(dramatic music)

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.538
(creature growls)

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:38.832
(guns fire)

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:40.333
(girls scream)

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:43.878
(guns fire)

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.303
- Go!
- Jack!

01:13:51.303 --> 01:13:52.303
(creature growls)

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:53.680
- Get him outta here, I'm
gonna go get the detonator.

01:13:53.722 --> 01:13:54.598
- No, Kimmy, I will do that.

01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:56.392
- Just shut up, let me do
something good for once!

01:13:56.392 --> 01:14:00.103
(dramatic music)

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:03.065
(creature growls)

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.987
(Kimmy whimpers)

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:13.825
(creature growls)

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.623
(creature roars)

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:24.670
(gun fires)

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:26.087
- I'll see you in hell, baby.

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.423
(creature growls)

01:14:28.423 --> 01:14:31.302
(dramatic music)

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:37.682
(creature snarls)
- Oh my God. (sobs)

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.355
(Kimmy screams)

01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:47.275
(gun fires)

01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:50.112
(Kimmy screams)

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:53.323
- Kimmy!

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:54.950
- She's gone.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:57.160
- What's this, kitty spit up a hairball?

01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:59.203
- Jack, what are you doing, he's dead.

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:03.750
- That's right, that's why
he's not gonna need this.

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:07.545
(dramatic music)

01:15:11.633 --> 01:15:15.845
- Rose, Rose.
(Rose whimpers)

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:17.180
I want you to get to the
docks, I'm telling you,

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:19.850
you get on the boat and you
get the hell outta here.

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:20.892
- What about you?

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:22.978
- Gunner's explosives were all set.

01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:25.105
I can still kill that thing.

01:15:25.105 --> 01:15:25.980
- The detonator's gone.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.690
- I got my detonator right here.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:29.652
If it doesn't work, I'll get on that ATV

01:15:29.652 --> 01:15:31.403
and I will hightail it outta here.

01:15:31.403 --> 01:15:33.405
- You've been shot, Jack.

01:15:33.405 --> 01:15:34.280
- It's nothing.

01:15:35.323 --> 01:15:36.283
- Please don't die?

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:39.662
- I'm a stunt man.

01:15:39.662 --> 01:15:41.203
This is what I do.

01:15:42.957 --> 01:15:44.833
I'll be fine.

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:47.585
(ominous music)

01:16:15.322 --> 01:16:18.033
(engine revs)

01:16:18.033 --> 01:16:20.410
(Rose pants)

01:16:20.452 --> 01:16:25.665
- Wait, wait! (sobs)

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.293
Kimmy didn't make it, Jack stayed behind

01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:29.837
to finish this thing.

01:16:29.837 --> 01:16:34.340
(monster snarls in distance)

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.050
- Sounds like he didn't make it.

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:38.262
Time for an exit.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:42.432
(dramatic music)

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:17.800
- Oh jeeze.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:20.178
Well, well, well, this will come in handy.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.015
So will that.

01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:27.018
(dramatic music)

01:17:44.745 --> 01:17:46.372
- [Professor] Hold on tight,
princess, you never know

01:17:46.372 --> 01:17:47.788
what we might bump into.

01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:55.213
- [Rose] I don't see it!

01:17:55.213 --> 01:17:57.965
- [Professor] I can feel it, it's near.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.635
(eerie music)

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:08.977
It knows we're here.
- How would you know?

01:18:09.895 --> 01:18:11.772
- [Professor] I have a
feeling they developed a taste

01:18:11.772 --> 01:18:15.275
for slow moving, halfwit
humans who stuff their face

01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:16.150
with fast food.

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:19.988
(dramatic music)

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.910
(creature snarls)

01:18:34.962 --> 01:18:37.755
- I don't understand,
why is it following us?

01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:39.590
- I don't know.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:43.095
It's never been spotted this
far down the river before.

01:18:43.095 --> 01:18:44.847
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:51.937
- What about this?

01:18:51.937 --> 01:18:54.230
- Give me that.
- No!

01:18:54.272 --> 01:18:55.857
- Give it to me!

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.108
(Rose grunts)

01:18:57.108 --> 01:18:59.360
Hey, hey, gimme that, hey!

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.408
- Jack could've stopped it.

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:06.868
- There are six billion homo sapiens

01:19:06.868 --> 01:19:08.203
running around on the planet.

01:19:08.203 --> 01:19:11.163
Biologically speaking we
are a cheap commodity.

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:13.208
That's a priceless evolutionary wonder,

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:16.002
the discovery of which will
probably go down in history.

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:17.878
You can count on that.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.090
My father taught me to
succeed at any price.

01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:25.095
- You're crazy, it killed your father!

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:29.808
(creature snarls)

01:19:29.808 --> 01:19:31.477
- Give me that!
- No!

01:19:31.477 --> 01:19:32.477
- I said give it to me.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:35.105
(Rose grunts)

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:42.070
This is gonna make me one
hell of an omelet. (laughs)

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:44.613
(dramatic music)

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.242
(Rose grunts)

01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:53.665
You know what, this
isn't over, little bitch.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:58.670
(eerie music)

01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:28.032
There it is.

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:30.285
- You bastard.
(professor shouts)

01:20:30.285 --> 01:20:33.580
(dramatic music)

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.455
No!

01:20:35.707 --> 01:20:38.585
(dramatic music)

01:20:40.337 --> 01:20:43.005
- [Professor] Hey, hey!

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:48.262
(dramatic music)
(creature growls)

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:51.890
Hey!

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.062
(creature growls)

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:00.398
(professor screams)

01:21:00.398 --> 01:21:03.277
(dramatic music)

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.128
- [Jack] Rose!

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:26.633
(Rose grunts)

01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:27.633
- Jack!

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:29.635
It was him, it's him.

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:31.220
- What, where's Lovegrove?

01:21:31.262 --> 01:21:33.265
- He's dead, it's following me.

01:21:33.265 --> 01:21:36.558
- Okay, quick, get on, get on, get on!

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.897
Let's get rid of these
things once and for all.

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:43.023
The only way is to get the mama.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.442
- Yeah, punch it!

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:47.362
(dramatic music)

01:22:26.652 --> 01:22:28.110
- [Jack] Hang on.

01:22:34.117 --> 01:22:35.160
- Did we lose it?

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.830
- Well done, come on, the
falls are this way, come on.

01:22:41.917 --> 01:22:44.835
Okay, come on, come on, be
careful, watch your feet.

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:47.547
That slimy snake is down there somewhere.

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:50.133
When she senses her baby
is close, she'll come.

01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:52.593
They got a sixth sense for their eggs.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.803
Come on, show your ugly face.

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:58.057
- (pants) Where is it?

01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:03.312
(creature growls)
(ominous music)

01:23:05.607 --> 01:23:06.482
- Take this.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:10.570
(creature growls)

01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:15.950
That's it, keep coming, keep coming.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:19.412
This is what you want.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.083
Catch this, you ugly bitch.

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:26.293
(creature snarls)

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:29.172
(dramatic music)

01:23:30.257 --> 01:23:31.173
- When do we hit the detonator?

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:33.092
- Just before we hit the water.

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:34.427
- What, oh God!

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:37.972
(bomb explodes)

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:40.850
(dramatic music)

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:57.117
(Jack laughs)

01:23:57.117 --> 01:24:00.162
Don't you ever do that to me again!

01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:03.957
At least not until our second date.

01:24:03.957 --> 01:24:06.793
