00:26.776 --> 00:28.574
On the
pathways of life,

00:28.576 --> 00:30.777
sometimes the road is bumpy.

00:32.247 --> 00:33.746
And sometimes the
terrain is rough.

00:33.748 --> 00:34.948
Not today.

00:34.950 --> 00:37.451
When you need
help getting back on track.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.135
Oh.

00:56.471 --> 00:59.472
Hi, I thought you
might be hungry.

00:59.474 --> 01:01.678
Mm, thanks.

01:04.578 --> 01:05.748
- Why, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12.588 --> 01:13.656
Sour cream and onion?

01:17.460 --> 01:18.294
Gross.

01:23.832 --> 01:24.666
So.

01:26.502 --> 01:27.337
How's the wife?

01:29.838 --> 01:32.474
Your mother's
doing very well, thank you.

01:34.109 --> 01:36.342
Ugh, Dad, fried
plantain and curry soup

01:36.344 --> 01:38.814
is not a girl's best friend, ew.

01:40.148 --> 01:42.818
How long do you plan to
keep camping out here, kid?

01:48.189 --> 01:50.426
Until Michael quits
being a royal a-hole.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.128
Then I'm sure racking
up a big hotel bill

01:54.130 --> 01:56.229
will do wonders for your
husband's disposition.

01:56.231 --> 01:57.700
It's fine, I used your card.

01:58.868 --> 01:59.736
Excuse me?

02:00.837 --> 02:04.437
You know, the one with
all the airline mile things,

02:04.439 --> 02:07.176
so in a way, you're welcome.

02:09.744 --> 02:11.246
That's not okay.

02:17.185 --> 02:17.820
All right.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.693
I'm not gonna be around
forever to bail you out.

02:26.695 --> 02:28.161
You gotta figure out

02:28.163 --> 02:29.631
what you're gonna do
with your life, kid.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.570
- I can't find a job, so...
- Finish school.

02:37.572 --> 02:40.173
Look, I'm just

02:40.175 --> 02:41.141
I'm waiting to hear

02:41.143 --> 02:43.112
if I'm gonna volunteer
at the cat shelter.

02:45.214 --> 02:47.581
- Ah, Jesus, Lindsey.
- What?

02:47.583 --> 02:51.218
I'd get to work with special
needs cats and kittens.

02:51.220 --> 02:56.226
And maybe I'll even be able
to keep one or two for free.

03:08.304 --> 03:10.373
For free, okay, come on.

03:11.673 --> 03:13.876
Walk your old man out,
got a plane to catch.

03:17.613 --> 03:18.514
I'm coming.

03:24.786 --> 03:29.422
That was a gift from a very
special student in Kyoto.

03:29.424 --> 03:33.796
It's Jizo, protector of women,
children, and travelers.

03:36.931 --> 03:39.869
Now, traditionally, turn around,

03:42.370 --> 03:46.873
traditionally, you
take Jizo statues

03:46.875 --> 03:50.213
and you put 'em in
intersections and paths,

03:52.347 --> 03:54.350
and it always tells you
the right way to go.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.820
I thought that would
be appropriate.

03:59.355 --> 04:00.923
Does Mom know you're
giving this to me?

04:03.325 --> 04:04.827
It's kinda really beautiful.

04:06.262 --> 04:08.298
Mom doesn't have
to know everything.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.732
This one's between you and me.

04:16.272 --> 04:18.005
Look,

04:18.007 --> 04:19.608
when I get back from the climb,

04:22.344 --> 04:25.582
can we all get together
as a family and talk?

04:38.993 --> 04:41.027
And we are live with
Dr. Montgomery Lou

04:41.029 --> 04:43.930
as he discusses
saving the world,

04:43.932 --> 04:45.399
one remote village at a time.

04:45.401 --> 04:47.700
Dr. Lou, tell us about
your next adventure.

04:47.702 --> 04:49.839
Lindsey, I'm
trying to be serious here.

04:51.005 --> 04:52.774
Well, it sounds like
I should film then.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.510
If you're being serious.

05:00.082 --> 05:00.916
I mean it.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.353
This is the last time.

05:05.687 --> 05:07.421
Your mother and I
love you very much,

05:07.423 --> 05:09.488
but you're never
gonna learn anything

05:09.490 --> 05:10.892
if we don't stop doing this.

05:13.094 --> 05:15.928
Why don't you take me on
your next adventure then?

05:15.930 --> 05:17.567
Yeah, it will be so much fun.

05:18.567 --> 05:19.965
I can be your assistant.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.435
You wanna go

05:21.437 --> 05:22.570
- on my next adventure, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

05:22.572 --> 05:26.976
What if it's too dangerous?

05:28.344 --> 05:29.375
Well, why don't
you go to places

05:29.377 --> 05:31.844
like Palm Springs or Key West?

05:31.846 --> 05:34.049
Because the University
won't pay for those.

05:36.017 --> 05:36.852
I know.

05:39.521 --> 05:42.292
Guess I'd better stay
stay here then, huh?

05:43.459 --> 05:45.461
In case you need me to
bail you out, right?

05:49.098 --> 05:49.932
Right.

06:03.978 --> 06:04.947
Go see your mother.

06:06.414 --> 06:07.382
She misses you.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.623
And I'm gonna miss you.

06:15.156 --> 06:16.522
But I'll be back.

06:22.130 --> 06:23.099
Thanks, Dad.

06:34.675 --> 06:36.111
- I
- love you, kiddo.

06:37.646 --> 06:39.349
I love you, too.

07:44.846 --> 07:47.513
Should have called a caterer.

07:47.515 --> 07:49.015
You got the dessert tray, right?

07:49.017 --> 07:49.851
Uh-huh.

07:51.786 --> 07:54.156
I've got something, I've got
it under control, it's fine.

08:01.796 --> 08:02.764
Have a cookie, Mom.

08:10.238 --> 08:13.175
Be ready for many
pleasures in the near future.

08:14.510 --> 08:15.144
Great.

08:16.178 --> 08:17.012
In bed.

08:18.014 --> 08:21.651
You know, after you read
a fortune, you say, no?

08:33.895 --> 08:35.631
The shrimp looks
beautiful, babe.

08:39.934 --> 08:41.636
How's Miss
Lou holding up?

08:44.640 --> 08:45.475
Good.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.174
Any thoughts on
going back to school?

08:49.176 --> 08:50.843
Follow in your
father's footsteps?

08:50.845 --> 08:53.748
Uh, I'm not really
the professor type.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.683
He's a tough act to follow.

08:56.685 --> 08:59.184
You're probably busy
with your career.

08:59.186 --> 09:04.192
Uh, no, not really, not
anything, yeah.

09:08.329 --> 09:11.063
Well, it was probably
some 20 years ago

09:11.065 --> 09:13.569
I went to the Atacama
Desert with your father.

09:14.670 --> 09:16.171
A trailblazer in
geological studies.

09:17.238 --> 09:18.974
He will be sorely missed.

09:21.609 --> 09:22.244
Thanks.

09:27.181 --> 09:30.683
Liam, did you tell your Aunt
Sandy how you're leaving me?

09:30.685 --> 09:33.919
I'm performing for
six weeks in Vienna.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.755
Liam, that's wonderful.

09:35.757 --> 09:37.289
Did you hear that JoJo?

09:37.291 --> 09:39.693
Lil' Leelee is going to France.

09:39.695 --> 09:40.894
Osterreich.

09:40.896 --> 09:43.697
We've got a significant
following in Europe.

09:43.699 --> 09:45.164
Mm.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.269
It's nothing, really,
I just play from the heart.

09:50.973 --> 09:52.575
What's the deal with Liam?

09:53.241 --> 09:54.877
Is he serious about her or what?

09:58.180 --> 10:00.679
I don't know, why?

10:00.681 --> 10:01.316
Your brother's hot.

10:02.883 --> 10:03.717
Look at him.

10:06.253 --> 10:08.121
Are you okay?

10:08.123 --> 10:09.389
Gross.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.294
He's your cousin,
think about that.

10:21.235 --> 10:22.070
Hey.

10:26.374 --> 10:27.208
Any luck?

10:28.343 --> 10:31.711
This one was starting to
bend but then you came in.

10:31.713 --> 10:32.348
Right.

10:34.349 --> 10:36.719
You think Dad's gonna
come back and haunt us?

10:38.719 --> 10:39.589
Seriously?

10:40.988 --> 10:44.359
Okay, not haunt, but visit us?

10:45.761 --> 10:47.195
Check in and make
sure we're okay?

10:49.765 --> 10:52.168
Look, they haven't
even confirmed he's dead.

10:53.401 --> 10:55.669
He could still be alive,
stuck up on that mountain,

10:55.671 --> 10:57.039
waiting for someone to find him.

10:58.806 --> 11:01.173
Then why'd we have a funeral?

11:01.175 --> 11:03.345
Because Mom likes
throwing parties.

11:04.780 --> 11:07.850
Hey, Linds, you have,
um, gas in your car?

11:09.151 --> 11:11.621
Uh, someone will be there soon.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.893
There was a mix-up
at the funeral home.

11:19.895 --> 11:23.265
Apparently we have Ming Lu.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.434
No.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.336
I really need you to do this.

11:29.470 --> 11:31.371
Oh, this is so stupid.

11:31.373 --> 11:33.707
Come on, I can't ask Monty.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.476
It's too much for him, I
gotta be here with Mom.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.377
Lindsey, please.

11:38.379 --> 11:40.682
This has been hard on
all of us, you know.

11:41.816 --> 11:44.217
We didn't get to say
goodbye to him, either.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.787
They couldn't even supply
a photo or properly ID him...

11:47.789 --> 11:49.489
Lindsey, don't.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.790
I'm going to be gone
for almost two months.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.326
Mom needs a lot of support.

11:53.328 --> 11:56.328
Now, just be the daughter
she never had, okay?

11:56.330 --> 11:57.365
That's all I'm asking.

12:14.281 --> 12:16.448
So this is a little more
information on the process.

12:16.450 --> 12:17.483
I really hope you'll
use our services...

12:18.853 --> 12:20.319
Hello there.

12:20.321 --> 12:21.990
Thank you, this is yours.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.062
If it means anything,
they're both in heaven.

12:27.762 --> 12:28.797
Right.

12:35.302 --> 12:36.468
Hey!

12:36.470 --> 12:38.438
Hey, come on,
that's my car, man!

12:38.440 --> 12:39.872
Come on, don't do this to me.

12:41.509 --> 12:42.744
Oh!

12:43.411 --> 12:44.977
Ugh.

13:29.523 --> 13:31.924
Great, a walker.

13:31.926 --> 13:33.592
What do ya think, DUI?

13:33.594 --> 13:35.395
Working girl?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.331
Maybe both.

13:47.843 --> 13:48.877
Pay attention, boys.

13:51.278 --> 13:53.882
Let me show ya how a real
man gets the job done.

14:05.526 --> 14:07.125
Excuse me, miss?

14:07.127 --> 14:09.194
May I ask you a question?

14:09.196 --> 14:11.898
Why you walking when
you should be driving?

14:11.900 --> 14:13.600
Pretty girl like you
liable to cause an accident

14:13.602 --> 14:15.101
making all these men
swerve their trucks

14:15.103 --> 14:18.404
to get a better look
at ya.

14:18.406 --> 14:20.606
Jerome Carlyle, and you are?

14:20.608 --> 14:21.442
Lindsey.

14:22.978 --> 14:23.813
Lindsey.

14:24.879 --> 14:27.313
Lindsey, I like that, it's
got a nice ring to it.

14:27.315 --> 14:30.949
Now is that Lind-say
or Lind-see?

14:30.951 --> 14:32.651
Just Lindsey.

14:32.653 --> 14:35.825
Well, Just Lindsey, you
can call me Jerry, with a Y.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.324
Hey, boys, this pretty
lady here needs a vehicle.

14:39.326 --> 14:40.261
Let's help her out.

14:57.478 --> 14:58.678
Tell you what

14:58.680 --> 15:00.313
I'll give a call down
to the tow company

15:00.315 --> 15:01.547
and I'll have your
car back faster

15:01.549 --> 15:03.082
than a jack rabbit in heat.

15:03.084 --> 15:05.018
My life is in that car.

15:05.020 --> 15:07.287
I know, I'll get
ya taken care of.

15:07.289 --> 15:08.958
That's the Jerry
Carlyle promise.

15:10.124 --> 15:11.658
'Cause I'm not taking
care of customers,

15:11.660 --> 15:13.228
I'm taking care of friends.

15:14.561 --> 15:18.997
Mm, yeah, I've seen
your commercials.

15:18.999 --> 15:21.202
Maybe you recognize
me from my TV show.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.974
Back to back Emmys
in '98 and '99.

15:26.407 --> 15:27.243
Oh, my god.

15:28.642 --> 15:30.709
Oh, my god, Troy Thunderton?

15:30.711 --> 15:32.111
That's it.

15:32.113 --> 15:36.082
Oh, oh, uh, where
there's Thunder?

15:36.084 --> 15:37.951
There's a ton of lightning.

15:41.055 --> 15:43.188
You may not need a car right
now but when you're ready,

15:43.190 --> 15:44.524
I want you to remember me.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.058
Yeah.

15:46.060 --> 15:49.028
- Yeah, I will, thanks.
- Thank you.

15:49.030 --> 15:50.099
This is too weird.

15:51.432 --> 15:52.267
Oh.

16:00.642 --> 16:01.477
Thank you.

16:03.711 --> 16:04.545
Lind-see.

17:09.209 --> 17:13.681
Hey, you think you've had
enough there, Mom, come on.

17:15.549 --> 17:19.117
Look, I don't want you to
worry about any of this, right?

17:19.119 --> 17:20.085
We'll take care of it.

17:20.087 --> 17:22.121
I told him not
to go, he insisted.

17:22.123 --> 17:23.255
It was work.

17:23.257 --> 17:24.359
That's who Dad was.

17:26.227 --> 17:27.762
Everest was always on his list.

17:29.130 --> 17:30.295
Can we get a dog?

17:30.297 --> 17:32.598
A dog's a lot of
responsibility, Mont.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.667
I don't even know
when the bills are due.

17:34.669 --> 17:36.235
He had several accounts.

17:36.237 --> 17:37.669
He never trusted
me with anything.

17:37.671 --> 17:40.305
Mom, Mom,
Lindsey can help.

17:40.307 --> 17:42.307
Really, Liam, with what?

17:42.309 --> 17:44.209
By drinking all my wine?

17:44.211 --> 17:47.345
She's got nothing going
on and she can help.

17:47.347 --> 17:48.848
Thanks for the
vote of confidence.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.387
We gotta get going.

17:53.321 --> 17:56.621
- Postpone your vacation.
- It's a European tour.

17:56.623 --> 17:58.123
You can't just cancel
a European tour.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.426
He has
a lot of fans overseas.

18:00.428 --> 18:02.495
I'll call you
from the airport.

18:02.497 --> 18:03.830
Caroline, just remember

18:03.832 --> 18:06.035
you're a shining star
of love and peace.

18:07.535 --> 18:09.537
Leave, just like your father.

18:17.178 --> 18:18.643
All right, all right.

18:18.645 --> 18:20.248
I'll give you a call, all right?

18:22.650 --> 18:24.617
Lindsey, you heading out?

18:24.619 --> 18:27.419
No, I thought I'd stay
here tonight, family time.

18:27.421 --> 18:29.221
Sign the divorce papers yet?

18:29.223 --> 18:30.122
No.

18:30.124 --> 18:31.791
- Why not?
- Not now, Liam.

18:31.793 --> 18:33.525
If it's over, let's
just get it over with

18:33.527 --> 18:35.227
so she can get on with her life.

18:35.229 --> 18:36.496
She's gonna have a lot to do

18:36.498 --> 18:37.729
to get her feet
back on the ground.

18:37.731 --> 18:38.898
Okay, I'm standing right here.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.833
Look, just do
something with your life.

18:41.835 --> 18:43.302
Mom, can you please
tell Liam to shut up?

18:43.304 --> 18:44.903
We don't say
that in this house.

18:44.905 --> 18:45.838
You know that.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.873
Sign the papers, just do it.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.409
Mont, you're the man
of the house now,

18:50.411 --> 18:52.081
so take care of Mom.

18:55.249 --> 18:56.084
See ya.

19:02.390 --> 19:03.225
Well.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.226
Good to have you, Lindsey.

19:08.228 --> 19:09.131
Better late than never.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.266
No more chips.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.301
Can you please set the alarm?

19:15.303 --> 19:16.569
That was your dad's job.

19:16.571 --> 19:18.173
You just press the button.

19:19.507 --> 19:21.373
Yeah, you figured it out.

19:21.375 --> 19:22.677
He'd be really proud.

19:25.279 --> 19:27.181
Hey, Linds, what are
you doing tomorrow?

19:32.253 --> 19:34.219
The last time we hung
out was at my graduation

19:34.221 --> 19:35.955
and you were fighting
with Michael.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.590
We'll see.

19:37.592 --> 19:38.694
I have a lot going on.

19:42.697 --> 19:44.263
You sound like Dad.

19:44.265 --> 19:44.900
Good.

19:52.472 --> 19:56.177
Have you thought
about college or work?

19:57.578 --> 19:59.844
My palm reader said
my gift is really strong

19:59.846 --> 20:01.716
and I just need to
harness my powers.

20:02.616 --> 20:04.249
See that?

20:04.251 --> 20:05.251
That means that I'm intuitive

20:05.253 --> 20:06.819
and have a keen sixth sense.

20:06.821 --> 20:09.892
And that one means that
destiny will dictate my life.

20:12.594 --> 20:14.395
I don't have that
line on my hand.

20:15.363 --> 20:17.763
She probably just told you that.

20:17.765 --> 20:18.997
It's a science, Lindsey.

20:18.999 --> 20:20.967
No two palms are alike.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.770
They're like snowflakes.

20:23.871 --> 20:25.174
Don't be dumb, Monty.

20:26.507 --> 20:29.443
It's just like
practicing the kazoo.

20:30.545 --> 20:32.381
I really need to
focus and get better.

20:34.382 --> 20:37.582
I moved up here abut 20 years
ago, started the dealership,

20:37.584 --> 20:39.619
and I've been here ever since.

20:40.555 --> 20:41.821
Well, speak of the devil.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.889
You didn't tell me
your car got towed.

20:43.891 --> 20:45.291
Surprise.

20:45.293 --> 20:46.292
How are you
gonna pay for that?

20:46.294 --> 20:49.562
You owe this gentleman a
great deal of gratitude.

20:49.564 --> 20:50.896
You must be Monty.

20:50.898 --> 20:53.365
Holy smokes, you're
the Thunderton guy.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.571
Yeah, well, I left that
life behind a while ago.

20:57.505 --> 20:58.803
It was fun while it lasted.

20:58.805 --> 21:01.209
You two used to
watch him nonstop.

21:02.343 --> 21:02.945
I remember.

21:04.612 --> 21:08.546
Well, um, thank you again
for all that you've done.

21:08.548 --> 21:12.517
It's, uh, crazy here and
I haven't had much help.

21:12.519 --> 21:15.454
That's all right,
no need to explain.

21:15.456 --> 21:17.355
I do need to get back to
the dealership, though.

21:17.357 --> 21:19.661
I'm kinda like the mother
hen to all them cocks.

21:20.995 --> 21:22.661
Uh,
well, thank you.

21:22.663 --> 21:24.530
You're welcome, any time.

21:24.532 --> 21:25.831
Oh, can I get a
ride back from you?

21:25.833 --> 21:28.367
- Would that be all right?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

21:28.369 --> 21:29.004
Great.

21:37.944 --> 21:41.046
I've got a confession to make.

21:41.048 --> 21:42.783
I really want your phone number.

21:48.422 --> 21:49.524
Don't make me beg.

22:03.805 --> 22:05.841
You'll be seeing me
real soon, I promise.

22:09.544 --> 22:12.381
Oh, my god, Troy Thunderton
totally just hit on me.

24:25.580 --> 24:26.548
Hey, Mr., uh,

24:27.815 --> 24:30.181
- Dr. Armstrong.
- Miss Lou.

24:30.183 --> 24:31.519
Always a terrific pleasure.

24:32.687 --> 24:34.488
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

24:37.024 --> 24:39.024
Do you have a minute?

24:39.026 --> 24:42.861
Sure, yeah, um, you
wanna take a seat?

24:42.863 --> 24:44.596
Yeah.

24:44.598 --> 24:47.533
Optimism is a beautiful
character trait, Lindsey.

24:47.535 --> 24:49.204
I always promote hope and faith,

24:50.604 --> 24:51.571
but even if your dad survived...

24:51.573 --> 24:53.238
But no one could put
him in the same area

24:53.240 --> 24:54.707
as the avalanche.

24:54.709 --> 24:57.543
He'd be without
food and shelter.

24:57.545 --> 24:59.777
For him to be separated from
his Sherpas in that terrain

24:59.779 --> 25:01.950
and survive is incomprehensible.

25:05.886 --> 25:06.720
Still.

25:08.956 --> 25:10.788
There's a chance?

25:10.790 --> 25:14.061
Yes, yes, there is
a chance, Lindsey.

25:17.163 --> 25:19.631
If anybody can get themselves
out of a situation like that,

25:19.633 --> 25:20.201
it's your dad.

25:21.835 --> 25:24.303
In all the years we traveled
across this globe together,

25:24.305 --> 25:26.170
your father got us out

25:26.172 --> 25:30.511
of one impossible
situation after another.

25:31.778 --> 25:34.280
I entrusted that
man with my life.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.151
And he always came through.

25:40.654 --> 25:41.956
I'm not much help, am I?

25:44.257 --> 25:45.890
You know, if I could,

25:45.892 --> 25:47.996
I'd go over there and
look for him myself.

25:50.698 --> 25:52.267
Well, maybe
that's what I'll do.

25:53.834 --> 25:55.135
Follow your heart, Lindsey.

25:59.973 --> 26:02.006
How do
I get to Everest?

26:03.244 --> 26:05.143
Searching the web on
how to cook chicken breasts.

26:06.346 --> 26:10.349
How do I plan a
trip to Mount Everest?

26:12.053 --> 26:13.619
Searching the web
for trips to music fest.

26:13.621 --> 26:15.086
You've got to be kidding me.

26:15.088 --> 26:17.755
I found five results
for digging in your knees.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.361
A round trip ticket
to Lhasa, China

26:22.363 --> 26:26.601
would be $2,148 with taxes.

26:27.867 --> 26:29.767
Okay.

26:29.769 --> 26:34.105
And an additional
one-way ticket back

26:34.107 --> 26:37.909
will be $1,168 with taxes.

26:37.911 --> 26:39.713
Wow.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.715
Okay, I'm not accusing you

26:42.717 --> 26:44.149
of not knowing how to
do your job or anything,

26:44.151 --> 26:46.986
but I was finding a lot
lower prices online.

26:46.988 --> 26:49.658
Like, a lot lower.

26:50.658 --> 26:53.792
Right, and if you are
a part of the group trek

26:53.794 --> 26:58.300
to Everest Base Camp, you'll
need to budget in for yaks.

27:00.401 --> 27:01.800
Yaks?

27:01.802 --> 27:04.637
I'd allow for
two to three yaks,

27:04.639 --> 27:07.609
but you'll have to make those
arrangements when you arrive.

27:08.976 --> 27:09.610
Okay.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.680
Are we buying a ticket today

27:15.682 --> 27:17.181
or are we just window shopping?

27:17.183 --> 27:20.386
Well, are there, like, any
promos or discounts going on?

27:20.388 --> 27:24.089
Planning a trip to Everest

27:24.091 --> 27:27.629
is different than
going to Disneyland.

27:28.763 --> 27:30.728
Well, I've never been
to Disneyland either

27:30.730 --> 27:34.332
so I wouldn't know, thanks.

27:34.334 --> 27:37.169
We're talking GORE-TEX
tents, sleeping equipment,

27:37.171 --> 27:39.071
layered seasonal
clothing, that's huge,

27:39.073 --> 27:40.839
the temps are gonna suck.

27:40.841 --> 27:44.176
Then you've got your oxygen
bottles, masks, regulators,

27:44.178 --> 27:47.679
medical kit, rescue
insurance, satellite phones,

27:47.681 --> 27:50.416
and then a bunch of other
stuff that I'm forgetting.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.851
Yeah, I'll probably
need a scarf, too.

27:52.853 --> 27:55.120
How many people
are on your team?

27:55.122 --> 27:57.922
Oh, no one
yet, so far, just me.

27:57.924 --> 27:59.725
I've been climbing
for the past 10 years,

27:59.727 --> 28:02.730
I don't recognize you from
any climbs, you, Mazama?

28:04.065 --> 28:07.099
Uh, I went to outdoor
school, like, in seventh grade.

28:07.101 --> 28:09.735
I mean, we went on a
hike that was uphill.

28:09.737 --> 28:12.170
Do you have any mittens
that are cheaper?

28:12.172 --> 28:13.240
These are like $30.

28:14.408 --> 28:16.774
Uh, for just the
basic gear alone

28:16.776 --> 28:19.311
you're looking at like
four k, and that's like,

28:19.313 --> 28:20.382
bare minimum stuff.

28:22.149 --> 28:23.314
Look, if you're serious,

28:23.316 --> 28:24.719
you'd better consider
getting a guide.

28:27.287 --> 28:29.455
You wanna go climb Everest?

28:29.457 --> 28:33.395
It's a little out of my
league, but I do know a guy.

28:35.095 --> 28:36.430
Here you go, that guy.

28:38.199 --> 28:40.466
Oh, yeah, that's tragic.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.970
Local climber, used to
come in all the time.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.006
- That's my dad.
- Oh.

28:49.008 --> 28:51.179
Whoa, so sorry.

28:52.513 --> 28:53.748
Thanks.

28:55.950 --> 28:57.381
I'd love to hear
stories sometime

28:57.383 --> 28:59.887
if you wanted to come
in and tell a story.

29:02.757 --> 29:03.757
Yeah, maybe later.

29:04.892 --> 29:05.727
Scoot.

29:06.526 --> 29:07.761
It's Scott.

29:08.828 --> 29:09.830
I lost a bet.

29:12.533 --> 29:13.767
Dammit.

29:18.037 --> 29:19.303
Where's Mom?

29:19.305 --> 29:22.110
Buying milk and wine.

29:25.779 --> 29:26.881
So, is this it?

29:28.248 --> 29:29.450
This is what you do?

29:36.790 --> 29:38.192
He's a mobile night light.

29:39.860 --> 29:40.728
Neat.

29:43.898 --> 29:46.501
Christmas is gonna be
really weird this year, huh?

29:48.536 --> 29:49.370
Maybe.

29:52.472 --> 29:54.742
Why didn't
Michael come to the funeral?

29:57.443 --> 29:58.278
Busy.

30:02.348 --> 30:03.383
I miss Dad.

30:05.286 --> 30:07.756
Yeah, me too.

30:29.075 --> 30:29.975
What do you want?

30:29.977 --> 30:31.409
I'm headed out.

30:31.411 --> 30:33.879
I need to get the papers
filed in the next couple days

30:33.881 --> 30:35.848
so if you could just
get those signed.

30:35.850 --> 30:36.849
You're going out?

30:36.851 --> 30:38.082
I really gotta go.

30:38.084 --> 30:39.787
I'm, like, headed out
the door right now.

30:40.955 --> 30:44.089
Yeah, well, maybe
I'll run into you.

30:44.091 --> 30:45.093
I'm out too.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.862
Girls night, yay.

30:49.162 --> 30:50.128
Bye.

30:50.130 --> 30:50.931
Michael?

31:07.981 --> 31:12.186
Jizo, protector of women,
children, and travelers.

31:13.988 --> 31:18.559
You take Jizo statues and put
'em in intersections and paths

31:19.893 --> 31:21.659
and it always tells you
the right way to go.

31:21.661 --> 31:22.564
Lindsey.

31:23.664 --> 31:26.163
Lindsey, I like that, that's
got a nice ring to it.

31:26.165 --> 31:28.001
Guess I better
stay here then, huh?

31:30.270 --> 31:32.440
In case you need me to
bail you out, right?

31:37.544 --> 31:38.379
Thanks, Dad.

31:51.357 --> 31:53.358
- Hey, good evening.
- Hi.

31:53.360 --> 31:57.498
We received a call that
there was a dead body in a car.

32:02.937 --> 32:03.567
What?

32:03.569 --> 32:04.669
Are you all right?

32:04.671 --> 32:07.605
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I was just taking a nap.

32:07.607 --> 32:10.274
Well, you can't stay here.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.177
You were sleeping in your car

32:12.179 --> 32:14.349
in the parking lot of
the police station.

32:17.017 --> 32:19.450
Oh, sorry.

32:19.452 --> 32:22.553
- I need you to move along.
- Okay, yeah, no problem.

32:22.555 --> 32:24.258
- Have a safe night.
- Thank you.

32:33.033 --> 32:33.998
What's wrong?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.233
Michael's working late

32:35.235 --> 32:37.438
and I thought I heard
someone in the backyard.

32:39.105 --> 32:39.940
Sure.

32:59.293 --> 33:00.628
Meatloaf Wednesday.

33:02.563 --> 33:03.164
It's hot.

33:05.431 --> 33:07.134
It was your dad's favorite.

33:08.334 --> 33:09.938
I never really
cared much for it.

33:11.438 --> 33:14.105
Well, you don't need to
make it until he gets home.

33:14.107 --> 33:14.741
Who's this guy?

33:16.209 --> 33:17.208
Some survival guy

33:17.210 --> 33:19.076
they drop off in the wilderness.

33:19.078 --> 33:20.312
Okay, why are
you watching this?

33:20.314 --> 33:22.016
- Don't watch this stuff.
- Well, they say that.

33:28.788 --> 33:30.490
Your brother
made it to Austria.

33:32.258 --> 33:33.094
Cool.

33:38.498 --> 33:39.299
Lindsey,

33:42.102 --> 33:45.070
I just, I feel like we
have so much to talk about.

33:45.072 --> 33:47.375
I mean, I've barely
seen you in three years.

33:49.043 --> 33:50.378
Where do you wanna start?

33:52.779 --> 33:54.047
How about my wedding?

33:59.186 --> 33:59.988
Not tonight.

34:01.654 --> 34:04.558
Kind of mother doesn't attend
her own daughter's wedding?

34:05.659 --> 34:07.324
Dad was there.

34:07.326 --> 34:08.592
He made an effort to be there

34:08.594 --> 34:09.996
and he was never
here to begin with.

34:11.098 --> 34:11.797
I'm sorry.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.266
I'll make the next one.

34:58.578 --> 35:00.647
Good morning, sleepyhead.

35:02.181 --> 35:03.084
Are you hungry?

35:05.419 --> 35:07.121
Make sure you save
some for Monty.

35:12.225 --> 35:14.259
Did someone
bring this over?

35:14.261 --> 35:17.495
No, I thought
I'd make breakfast.

35:17.497 --> 35:18.696
I'm allowed to, aren't I?

35:18.698 --> 35:21.835
What, you thought I got up
early and went to McDonald's?

35:23.169 --> 35:25.370
McDonald's
doesn't have bacon.

35:25.372 --> 35:29.743
So, have you considered
applying for a job?

35:32.712 --> 35:33.547
Mom.

35:34.781 --> 35:37.348
You know, I thought maybe
we could go to the mall today,

35:37.350 --> 35:40.384
pick you out a
really cute outfit,

35:40.386 --> 35:42.920
go to one of the cosmetic
counters, get you a makeover,

35:42.922 --> 35:45.526
and maybe clean you
up a little bit.

35:46.627 --> 35:47.462
For who?

35:50.230 --> 35:51.096
I just thought that maybe

35:51.098 --> 35:53.330
you would feel
better about yourself

35:53.332 --> 35:54.868
if you put yourself together.

35:55.935 --> 35:57.437
I feel awesome about myself.

35:58.638 --> 36:00.774
It's everyone else that seems
to have a problem with me.

36:08.848 --> 36:09.683
Hungry?

36:13.219 --> 36:15.723
Hey, what's up?

36:18.892 --> 36:21.562
I had a dream that
he was still alive

36:24.797 --> 36:26.901
waiting for us to come get him.

36:28.234 --> 36:31.905
Monty, was it a dream
or a psychic vision?

36:33.406 --> 36:34.508
It was a vision.

36:37.678 --> 36:38.679
It was real.

36:45.551 --> 36:47.254
Sorry, I'm just dumb.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.857
No, you're not.

36:52.893 --> 36:53.728
You're gifted.

36:55.728 --> 36:57.531
You just need to
practice your gift.

37:03.337 --> 37:04.472
Queen of Hearts.

37:09.475 --> 37:10.911
Ace of Spades.

37:12.446 --> 37:13.514
Ace of clubs.

37:14.982 --> 37:17.248
There's too damn many of them.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.250
You've been through
the deck twice.

37:19.252 --> 37:21.652
I figured you'd get
at least one right.

37:26.727 --> 37:27.926
Hello?

37:27.928 --> 37:30.295
Is that an
angel on the other line?

37:30.297 --> 37:33.301
I'm trying to reach a young
lady by the name of Lindsey.

37:35.002 --> 37:37.402
Well, you got her.

37:37.404 --> 37:38.036
We'll see about that.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.437
You alone?

37:39.439 --> 37:41.272
Sorta.

37:41.274 --> 37:42.074
I thought
you might be interested

37:42.076 --> 37:43.811
- in making a little money.
- Yes!

37:45.312 --> 37:47.312
What did you have in mind?

37:47.314 --> 37:48.446
I'm looking for a
couple real special people

37:48.448 --> 37:49.948
to help me out,

37:49.950 --> 37:51.949
and I immediately thought
of you and your brother.

37:51.951 --> 37:52.786
Really?

37:53.853 --> 37:55.256
Um, thanks.

37:57.290 --> 37:58.258
What should I wear?

38:02.361 --> 38:03.597
Why are we doing this?

38:04.598 --> 38:06.031
Well, I've been thinking.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.600
If you're going to develop
your psychic powers,

38:08.602 --> 38:10.534
then you're gonna
need special training.

38:10.536 --> 38:11.770
If we're gonna hire someone,

38:11.772 --> 38:12.974
it's going to cost
a lot of money.

38:14.408 --> 38:15.806
Why do you care?

38:15.808 --> 38:16.643
I wanna help

38:18.611 --> 38:21.248
because that's what
big sisters do.

38:31.325 --> 38:32.589
Chris Black to
the corral please,

38:32.591 --> 38:34.294
Chris Black to the corral.

38:38.964 --> 38:39.598
Of course.

38:40.966 --> 38:42.535
A deal just walked off the lot.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.670
That's money out of your
pocket, what's your excuse?

38:45.672 --> 38:47.672
I was obviously
in the bathroom.

38:47.674 --> 38:48.509
Oh.

38:49.975 --> 38:51.442
Ah.

38:51.444 --> 38:52.312
You've got a phone.

38:53.513 --> 38:55.513
Keep someone on the other
line while you taking a leak.

38:55.515 --> 38:57.781
Two eyes on the lot at
all times, you understand?

38:57.783 --> 38:59.817
Sure, mm-hmm, eyes on the lot.

38:59.819 --> 39:00.953
Don't wanna miss anything.

39:00.955 --> 39:03.554
Don't piss on my leg and
tell me it's raining, son.

39:03.556 --> 39:05.426
Now go out there
and sell me a truck.

39:18.705 --> 39:21.373
You think I was
too rough on him?

39:21.375 --> 39:24.812
No, no, not at all,
just, uh, tough love.

39:26.379 --> 39:27.381
Tough love.

39:28.482 --> 39:32.150
You're one of a kind,
Lindsey Lou, you know that?

39:32.152 --> 39:34.486
Uh, I don't know if
it's an issue or not,

39:34.488 --> 39:36.855
but we don't know
anything about cars.

39:36.857 --> 39:38.922
I've only had my
license for three months

39:38.924 --> 39:40.958
and I don't know how
to parallel park.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.159
It's all right.

39:42.161 --> 39:44.596
I'll take enthusiasm
over experience any day.

39:44.598 --> 39:46.931
You know what else
is important, son?

39:46.933 --> 39:47.768
Drive.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.004
Desire.

39:51.671 --> 39:54.505
Drive and desire, that's all
you need in this business.

39:54.507 --> 39:55.408
Take a look out there.

39:56.442 --> 39:59.412
Any idiot can sell a car.

40:02.415 --> 40:04.415
Anyhoo, random drug testing

40:04.417 --> 40:06.150
is the second Thursday
of every month.

40:06.152 --> 40:08.855
The only thing they're looking
for is cocaine or heroin.

40:11.991 --> 40:13.593
That gonna be a problem for you?

40:14.761 --> 40:17.529
I'm on four allergy
medications and I...

40:17.531 --> 40:18.366
Ahem!

40:19.598 --> 40:21.433
Not a problem.

40:21.435 --> 40:24.739
Well, are you here to keep
me company or sell a car?

40:25.571 --> 40:26.870
I'll sell two cars.

40:26.872 --> 40:28.441
Oh, fantastic.

40:29.442 --> 40:30.477
That's great.

40:35.114 --> 40:38.583
Listen, do me a favor, will ya?

40:38.585 --> 40:41.455
Just keep an eye on your
brother, keep him out of trouble.

40:42.689 --> 40:44.625
Can't I stay
in here with you instead?

40:46.091 --> 40:47.491
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

40:47.493 --> 40:48.592
That's a promise.

40:49.696 --> 40:51.065
Relax, you're gonna be fine.

40:53.533 --> 40:54.567
Now go get your job done.

40:55.902 --> 40:57.569
Yeah, oh, great.

40:57.571 --> 40:58.937
Wait, shh, shh.

40:58.939 --> 41:00.605
You hear that?

41:00.607 --> 41:02.574
You hear that?

41:02.576 --> 41:03.542
Wait, wait, you hear that?

41:03.544 --> 41:08.047
Uh, no, what I am
supposed to be hearing?

41:10.683 --> 41:12.250
Thunderton, Lindsey.

41:13.419 --> 41:17.821
Thunderton, the quiet rumble
of approaching Thunderton.

41:17.823 --> 41:20.525
And where there's
Thunderton, there's what?

41:21.328 --> 41:22.125
- Lightning.
- There's lightning.

41:22.127 --> 41:23.261
That's right.

41:23.263 --> 41:24.596
What do you think?

41:24.598 --> 41:25.464
You think it will strike twice?

41:25.466 --> 41:27.565
I don't really
know what that means,

41:27.567 --> 41:29.804
but it sounds really hot.

41:30.937 --> 41:31.772
That's my girl.

41:33.540 --> 41:34.742
Now go on and go get it.

41:46.719 --> 41:48.987
This place is amazeballs.

41:57.297 --> 41:58.862
We're not selling cars here.

41:58.864 --> 42:00.964
We're selling personality
and lifestyle.

42:00.966 --> 42:03.067
If they don't like you, they
ain't buying, all right?

42:03.069 --> 42:05.636
They ain't coming here to
make friends or kill time.

42:05.638 --> 42:07.772
They're here to buy a damn car.

42:07.774 --> 42:10.308
Always be closing, you
ever hear that phrase?

42:10.310 --> 42:11.308
The ABCs?

42:11.310 --> 42:12.546
- No.
- No.

42:13.747 --> 42:16.580
Well, whatever, I've got a
bit of a different approach.

42:16.582 --> 42:19.486
S-T-D.

42:21.721 --> 42:23.821
Seal the deal, all right?

42:23.823 --> 42:27.025
That's when you ask for the
sale and if they don't budge,

42:27.027 --> 42:30.661
you lie, you beg, you steal,
whatever you have to do,

42:30.663 --> 42:31.763
you make the deal.

42:31.765 --> 42:33.665
Understand, seal the deal.

42:33.667 --> 42:36.301
- STD.
- STD, absolutely.

42:36.303 --> 42:37.902
Tell you what, why
don't you go out there

42:37.904 --> 42:39.770
and just make yourself
familiar with the inventory?

42:39.772 --> 42:41.306
Can you do that for me?

42:41.308 --> 42:43.341
- Yeah.
- All right.

42:47.279 --> 42:49.781
Listen, I, um, I
hate to ask this but...

42:49.783 --> 42:53.083
No, no, what's
on your mind, Lindsey Lou?

42:53.085 --> 42:56.256
Well, exactly how much
money am I going to make?

42:57.357 --> 42:58.526
How much you want?

42:59.893 --> 43:02.225
No, seriously, it's just that

43:02.227 --> 43:03.895
I'm trying to save
up for this trip

43:03.897 --> 43:05.129
- that I'm going on...
- I understand.

43:05.131 --> 43:06.364
I'll tell you what.

43:06.366 --> 43:07.234
You stick with me

43:08.768 --> 43:11.234
and I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go.

43:11.236 --> 43:13.605
The money will come, I promise.

43:13.607 --> 43:14.873
It'll come faster

43:14.875 --> 43:18.012
than lightning chasing down a
jackalope on the barren plain.

43:21.915 --> 43:23.348
Okay, seriously,
you gotta stop

43:23.350 --> 43:25.183
using lines from your show.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.650
It's just very, uh...

43:26.652 --> 43:27.384
Sensual?

43:27.386 --> 43:28.685
Confusing.

43:28.687 --> 43:29.323
Hmm.

43:32.658 --> 43:36.296
I want you to embrace
your inner coyote.

43:37.163 --> 43:38.996
You know what I mean?

43:38.998 --> 43:40.100
Take down the buffalo.

43:43.303 --> 43:46.737
Again, I don't quite
know what you mean,

43:46.739 --> 43:48.174
but it sounds really hot.

44:15.335 --> 44:16.268
What?

44:16.270 --> 44:18.101
You wanna drive me
around blindfolded?

44:18.103 --> 44:20.341
Then I can try to see where
we are using my mind's eye?

44:24.944 --> 44:26.444
Psst!

44:26.446 --> 44:28.179
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:28.181 --> 44:31.415
It's Scoot from
the Mountain Shop.

44:31.417 --> 44:32.385
Yeah, yeah.

44:34.687 --> 44:38.823
I'm just here doing
research for the climb.

44:38.825 --> 44:40.024
- Cool.
- Yeah.

44:40.026 --> 44:42.726
I'm just, I'm
here for story hour.

44:42.728 --> 44:44.261
Oh.

44:44.263 --> 44:46.032
They usually have a puppet
show and sometimes cookies.

44:50.937 --> 44:52.469
I'm here with my nephew.

44:52.471 --> 44:53.306
He's seven.

44:54.406 --> 44:55.406
- I'm just his ride.
- Right.

44:55.408 --> 44:58.176
I'm totally
not into puppet shows.

44:58.178 --> 45:00.812
- No.
- Oh, god, that's weird.

45:00.814 --> 45:03.884
Do you wanna come
down to the end here?

45:06.453 --> 45:09.453
Hello.

45:09.455 --> 45:12.489
Say, not that I'm an
expert or anything,

45:12.491 --> 45:15.893
but I have done my
fair share of climbing.

45:15.895 --> 45:18.830
Maybe we could get
some coffee sometime

45:18.832 --> 45:21.000
and talk about climbing?

45:22.335 --> 45:26.804
Uh, yeah, I guess, sure.

45:26.806 --> 45:27.772
That's awesome.

45:27.774 --> 45:29.306
Shh!

45:29.308 --> 45:30.143
I'm so sorry.

45:35.748 --> 45:36.382
Yes!

45:41.821 --> 45:45.823
Well, I think it is fantastic

45:45.825 --> 45:49.326
that you both got a job on
the same day, it's great.

45:49.328 --> 45:50.527
It's no big deal.

45:50.529 --> 45:51.964
Well,
I think it is.

45:53.799 --> 45:55.435
You know who else
would think it was?

45:57.069 --> 45:58.071
Dad.

45:59.372 --> 46:00.871
He would have
been really proud.

46:00.873 --> 46:01.709
He will be.

46:04.210 --> 46:07.844
Remember when dad would come
home with all the presents?

46:07.846 --> 46:08.482
And stories?

46:10.015 --> 46:12.118
He always
thought of you kids.

46:13.786 --> 46:16.089
He said he'd bring me
home a bumper sticker.

46:17.022 --> 46:18.790
For what?

46:18.792 --> 46:19.860
Your forehead?

46:33.872 --> 46:35.475
Can you find my dad or not?

46:43.582 --> 46:46.083
He knows the area your
father went missing.

46:46.085 --> 46:50.224
- Many people die there.
- He's not dead, just lost.

46:55.895 --> 46:57.194
He'll do it.

46:57.196 --> 46:58.297
No guarantee, though.

47:00.500 --> 47:02.402
Well, maybe I
should shop around.

47:03.569 --> 47:05.138
I need a guy who can
get the job done.

47:09.843 --> 47:11.074
He'll get the job done

47:11.076 --> 47:14.281
and wants you to know
it will come at a price.

47:16.248 --> 47:17.080
Yeah.

47:17.082 --> 47:18.384
2,000, cash.

47:20.886 --> 47:23.856
Fine, I'll add it to the bill.

47:26.893 --> 47:28.893
How do you find him?

47:28.895 --> 47:30.895
You don't look like
a mountain climber.

47:30.897 --> 47:33.563
Scott, the Mountain Shop.

47:33.565 --> 47:34.401
Scoot!

47:37.870 --> 47:39.069
We just
can't leave him here.

47:39.071 --> 47:40.504
He'll be fine.

47:40.506 --> 47:42.505
What if he gets
hungry or something?

47:42.507 --> 47:43.908
Well, he can go
get something to eat.

47:43.910 --> 47:46.344
He's not a freakin'
Gremlin, Monty.

47:46.346 --> 47:48.446
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

47:48.448 --> 47:50.450
Now look, we've gotta
get to work, okay?

47:52.317 --> 47:56.120
All right, fine, you can stay
here and I'll go to work.

47:56.122 --> 47:57.054
Okay.

47:57.056 --> 47:58.589
Just don't sit around all day.

47:58.591 --> 48:00.359
Bend spoons or something.

48:10.069 --> 48:11.301
Hey!

48:11.303 --> 48:12.303
What's the deal
with you and Jerry?

48:12.305 --> 48:13.603
Mind your own business.

48:13.605 --> 48:14.605
You keep prancing around here

48:14.607 --> 48:17.975
acting like you own the
place, it's my business.

48:17.977 --> 48:19.210
Jealous?

48:19.212 --> 48:20.478
Barely, you think
you're the first?

48:20.480 --> 48:22.145
Whatever.

48:22.147 --> 48:23.647
The guy's a fraud.

48:23.649 --> 48:26.016
He had a local kids show,
now he's a car salesman,

48:26.018 --> 48:28.351
all right, the writing
is on the wall.

48:28.353 --> 48:31.288
Troy Thunderton was an Emmy
winning children's show, okay?

48:31.290 --> 48:33.024
He taught values
and life lessons

48:33.026 --> 48:34.491
from his Native
American ancestors

48:34.493 --> 48:35.692
that you wouldn't even
begin to understand.

48:35.694 --> 48:37.527
The guy's from
El Paso, all right?

48:37.529 --> 48:39.198
He's about as native as Wallace.

48:40.332 --> 48:41.933
I give you two weeks.

48:41.935 --> 48:42.699
That's about as long
as the others lasted.

48:44.169 --> 48:45.338
Lindsey Lou
to the corral please.

48:51.176 --> 48:52.076
Hey.

48:52.078 --> 48:52.913
Ho.

48:57.149 --> 48:59.116
You're awfully quiet.

48:59.118 --> 48:59.953
Just thinking.

49:02.355 --> 49:04.721
Remember all those times
you rescued baby animals

49:04.723 --> 49:07.257
with Tornado, your
Indian sidekick

49:07.259 --> 49:09.997
and you'd bring them
back to your wigwam?

49:12.031 --> 49:16.003
Troy Thunderton broadcasted
from a custom studio pueblo,

49:16.703 --> 49:17.905
not a wigwam.

49:19.105 --> 49:19.940
Right.

49:22.007 --> 49:24.007
I used to wish you'd
show up at my house

49:24.009 --> 49:25.243
when my dad was
gone on business,

49:25.245 --> 49:30.450
and bring us baby raccoons and
teach us how to make baskets

49:31.049 --> 49:32.218
and grow corn.

49:33.752 --> 49:34.955
It's not too late.

49:36.589 --> 49:40.060
There's always time
for lightning lessons.

49:41.259 --> 49:42.493
Listen, I need to
get to the auction

49:42.495 --> 49:43.728
and take a look
at some used cars.

49:43.730 --> 49:45.696
You'll be all right here
all by your lonesome?

49:45.698 --> 49:47.364
Can't I tag along?

49:47.366 --> 49:48.665
Maybe we can get coffee?

49:48.667 --> 49:50.970
You know what, I
got a better idea.

49:52.538 --> 49:55.242
What do you say we forget
this place and go to Mexico?

49:58.377 --> 49:59.412
Serious?

50:03.082 --> 50:05.750
All right, if you
make a car deal,

50:05.752 --> 50:09.957
Igor here will take
mighty good care of ya.

50:11.591 --> 50:12.692
Wait, what?

50:20.198 --> 50:21.031
Okay.

50:36.681 --> 50:37.718
Well, hello.

50:39.819 --> 50:41.021
And to you, ma'am.

50:42.254 --> 50:43.687
Milk.

50:43.689 --> 50:45.623
Kids drank it all.

50:45.625 --> 50:46.589
Of course.

50:46.591 --> 50:47.994
Well, you know what they say.

50:49.328 --> 50:51.261
Milk does a body good.

50:51.263 --> 50:53.332
Or something like that.

50:54.500 --> 50:55.502
Walk you to your car?

50:57.569 --> 50:59.105
What a gentleman you are.

51:00.105 --> 51:02.008
Yes, ma'am.

51:11.616 --> 51:13.085
I got it on trade.

51:14.187 --> 51:16.223
You got STD
power, I like that.

51:18.790 --> 51:19.792
Um, thanks.

51:37.442 --> 51:39.243
So, what did you do all day?

51:39.245 --> 51:41.145
We watched Criss
Angel episodes.

51:41.147 --> 51:42.346
And?

51:42.348 --> 51:43.848
I'm definitely gonna
need leather pants

51:43.850 --> 51:46.520
and an awesome hairdo if
I ever want to go on TV.

51:49.522 --> 51:52.223
Oh, and I went to the library

51:52.225 --> 51:55.759
and I found all three seasons
of the Troy Thunderton show.

51:55.761 --> 51:57.330
I thought we could
watch them tonight.

51:58.531 --> 52:02.569
No, I'm gonna watch
those later, alone.

52:12.578 --> 52:13.911
Howdy.

52:13.913 --> 52:15.478
Hi.

52:15.480 --> 52:19.183
Uh, I wasn't expecting
you to stop by.

52:19.185 --> 52:20.484
Surprised?

52:20.486 --> 52:23.386
Yeah, I mean, I
would've changed

52:23.388 --> 52:26.190
and put on something
a little more fun.

52:26.192 --> 52:27.024
No one will be able to tell

52:27.026 --> 52:28.926
when you're
galloping on a horse.

52:28.928 --> 52:29.830
You look terrific.

52:30.997 --> 52:34.134
Well, there's the belle of
the ball, Miss Caroline Lou.

52:35.301 --> 52:37.902
- You look so handsome.
- You look gorgeous yourself.

52:37.904 --> 52:39.837
Do you mind if we
stop for a coffee first?

52:39.839 --> 52:43.274
We are completely out here
and I am running on no sleep.

52:43.276 --> 52:44.208
That sounds perfect.

52:44.210 --> 52:46.210
I promise I won't
keep her out too late.

52:46.212 --> 52:48.212
She's been working so hard.

52:48.214 --> 52:49.779
Look how exhausted she is.

52:49.781 --> 52:52.248
Oh, I was thinking,
after coffee,

52:52.250 --> 52:54.817
have you heard of that new
country bar that's opened up?

52:54.819 --> 52:56.319
Tumblin' Weed, I sure have.

52:56.321 --> 52:57.855
Well,
they have line dancing.

52:57.857 --> 52:59.255
Yeah, we can go there.

52:59.257 --> 53:00.958
I have my dancing shoes on.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.462
All right, let's get.

53:05.464 --> 53:06.732
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

53:11.203 --> 53:12.471
Motherfucker.

53:28.221 --> 53:28.953
Have fun?

53:30.056 --> 53:32.755
Oh, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

53:32.757 --> 53:34.225
Good.

53:34.227 --> 53:35.993
Aren't you supposed
to work early?

53:35.995 --> 53:38.228
How could you do that to Dad?

53:38.230 --> 53:38.862
Oh.

53:38.864 --> 53:39.996
You're still married.

53:39.998 --> 53:41.297
- That's adultery.
- Lindsey.

53:41.299 --> 53:43.466
Oh, come on.

53:43.468 --> 53:46.270
Oh, I gotta get
out of these Spanx.

53:46.272 --> 53:46.907
Why him?

53:48.373 --> 53:49.573
Jerry?

53:49.575 --> 53:52.375
He's such a nice
guy, you know that.

53:52.377 --> 53:53.810
He asked me out.

53:53.812 --> 53:54.745
You could have anyone you want

53:54.747 --> 53:56.312
and you choose the one person

53:56.314 --> 53:58.348
who takes an
interest in my life.

53:58.350 --> 53:59.382
What?

53:59.384 --> 54:01.351
Oh, honey, don't
flatter yourself.

54:01.353 --> 54:03.386
Besides, you're married.

54:03.388 --> 54:05.556
Speak for yourself.

54:05.558 --> 54:10.530
We went and had coffee
and then line dancing.

54:11.663 --> 54:12.962
And it was a lot
of fun.

54:12.964 --> 54:15.299
It was a lot of fun.

54:15.301 --> 54:17.636
Good night, darling.

54:22.475 --> 54:25.645
Step right
up, don't be shy.

54:29.381 --> 54:30.480
Everything all right?

54:30.482 --> 54:31.882
What do you think?

54:31.884 --> 54:33.317
I think you look about as mad

54:33.319 --> 54:35.386
as a mule chewing on bumblebees.

54:35.388 --> 54:37.353
Did I earn this?

54:37.355 --> 54:39.989
I threw a couple
spiffs in there for ya.

54:39.991 --> 54:40.826
You too.

54:42.361 --> 54:43.294
I told you I was
gonna take care of ya.

54:43.296 --> 54:45.498
You think I'd send
you home with nothing?

54:46.665 --> 54:48.598
C'mon, kid, let's
go eat an orange.

54:48.600 --> 54:49.799
I don't like oranges.

54:49.801 --> 54:52.069
Mm, you haven't had
one of my oranges.

54:52.071 --> 54:52.906
Okay.

54:59.312 --> 55:00.313
How's your mother?

55:01.547 --> 55:04.380
Her feet must be hurting
something awful after last night.

55:04.382 --> 55:07.618
The only thing she has is
a serious case of the skank.

55:07.620 --> 55:09.022
Be careful, it's contagious.

55:10.355 --> 55:12.089
Is that how you
speak to your elders?

55:12.091 --> 55:14.091
That's all you have to say?

55:14.093 --> 55:17.364
Look, I may have
retired from TV,

55:18.397 --> 55:20.496
but I'll never stop crusading

55:20.498 --> 55:23.335
to help other people find
what makes them their best.

55:24.102 --> 55:26.405
Your mother just needed
a bolt from above.

55:27.105 --> 55:28.908
You had no intention, did you?

55:30.910 --> 55:31.745
Of what?

55:35.881 --> 55:38.984
Are you saying that
none of this was real?

55:45.825 --> 55:47.123
I've been in love with you

55:47.125 --> 55:49.062
since you were on a
cable access show.

55:50.395 --> 55:51.627
I may have been 10 years old

55:51.629 --> 55:53.065
but you made an
impression on me.

55:54.132 --> 55:55.701
It's time to grow up, Lindsey.

55:57.535 --> 55:59.902
Maybe take a lesson
from your mother.

55:59.904 --> 56:00.739
Never.

56:08.446 --> 56:09.315
Like the orange?

56:10.448 --> 56:11.483
Is it gluten free?

56:12.817 --> 56:14.051
I think so.

56:14.053 --> 56:14.951
It tastes weird.

56:14.953 --> 56:16.487
Tastes weird?

56:16.489 --> 56:17.824
Hey. How much was your check?

56:19.158 --> 56:21.491
$500.

56:21.493 --> 56:22.426
Okay, good, me too.

56:22.428 --> 56:23.596
We need to save those, okay?

56:26.531 --> 56:29.833
But can't I keep
some for myself?

56:29.835 --> 56:30.670
No.

56:32.404 --> 56:35.172
But I wanted to get a
Troy Thunderton spray tan.

56:35.174 --> 56:36.409
No.

56:46.152 --> 56:49.085
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
go have sushi with Jerry

56:49.087 --> 56:50.487
and then I'll be back.

56:50.489 --> 56:51.591
You don't eat sushi.

56:52.690 --> 56:54.991
It smells like a barn in here.

56:54.993 --> 56:57.096
Come on, I asked you
guys not to let the.

56:58.897 --> 57:00.531
He needs to go home.

57:00.533 --> 57:02.132
He's training me.

57:02.134 --> 57:05.701
Honey, I know it's been
really stressful lately,

57:05.703 --> 57:08.140
but that's no
excuse to act crazy.

57:09.174 --> 57:11.074
Have fun on your date.

57:11.076 --> 57:13.544
Thank you, I will,
and you know why?

57:13.546 --> 57:15.078
Because
you're selfish?

57:15.080 --> 57:16.616
Ha, Lindsey Lou.

57:17.982 --> 57:20.183
Because it hasn't even
been a week since the funeral

57:20.185 --> 57:22.453
and you're already looking
for Dad's replacement?

57:22.455 --> 57:24.221
Okay, watch your mouth.

57:24.223 --> 57:26.022
No one can replace your father.

57:26.024 --> 57:28.458
You not even
100% sure he's gone

57:28.460 --> 57:31.027
and that we have
the right ashes.

57:31.029 --> 57:32.529
If the funeral home
can't get it right

57:32.531 --> 57:34.230
what makes you think the
Chinese government did?

57:34.232 --> 57:36.466
Your father made a living

57:36.468 --> 57:39.169
leaving me home alone
for months on end.

57:39.171 --> 57:41.772
Do you think I ever got
a phone call from him

57:41.774 --> 57:45.174
when he was in Africa,
South America, anywhere?

57:45.176 --> 57:46.576
Whatever.

57:46.578 --> 57:47.743
And when he would come home,

57:47.745 --> 57:50.214
he would hole himself
up in his office

57:50.216 --> 57:54.051
or do whatever his
children wanted.

57:54.053 --> 57:54.984
Knock it off.

57:54.986 --> 57:56.219
So you miss your father

57:56.221 --> 57:57.890
after not seeing him
for three months.

57:59.091 --> 58:01.428
I haven't seen him
for over 20 years.

58:02.127 --> 58:03.694
I hardly saw anyone.

58:03.696 --> 58:06.466
So yes, I'm gonna go have lunch.

58:08.167 --> 58:09.799
Because what other
option do I have

58:09.801 --> 58:11.534
but, I don't know,
sit around here

58:11.536 --> 58:14.937
and pretend that he's
going to come home?

58:14.939 --> 58:16.675
Okay, perfect.

58:17.743 --> 58:19.775
While you're pretending
like he's alive,

58:19.777 --> 58:21.210
why don't you sit in your room

58:21.212 --> 58:24.917
and dress in black and
mourn like a normal person?

58:27.785 --> 58:29.087
Like a normal person?

58:35.160 --> 58:35.995
Monty.

58:37.296 --> 58:38.531
Monty.

58:40.064 --> 58:40.899
Monty.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.600
Monty, come on.

58:44.602 --> 58:46.569
Knock it off, just cool down.

58:46.571 --> 58:47.538
You're not going anywhere.

58:47.540 --> 58:49.940
I'm 18, I can do what I want.

58:49.942 --> 58:52.042
I'll report you
for animal cruelty.

58:52.044 --> 58:53.243
And who's gonna feed the goat?

58:53.245 --> 58:54.578
You don't understand.

58:54.580 --> 58:56.647
Yes, I do.

58:56.649 --> 58:58.080
Okay, she's acting
like a total slut

58:58.082 --> 59:00.886
and you know she's only doing
this because I like Jerry.

59:02.620 --> 59:04.620
I never got to know Dad.

59:04.622 --> 59:05.958
Not like you and Liam did.

59:07.960 --> 59:11.027
Look, I swear to God,
everything's gonna be different

59:11.029 --> 59:13.663
when he gets back,
Monty, I promise.

59:13.665 --> 59:14.297
Mom's right.

59:14.299 --> 59:15.667
Dad was never here.

59:16.335 --> 59:18.034
I was in school when Dad left,

59:18.036 --> 59:20.770
and I feel like he's just
gonna come back any day

59:20.772 --> 59:21.975
right through that door.

59:24.676 --> 59:27.546
Do you think Dad would be happy
if he were here right now?

59:29.614 --> 59:31.817
Well, he may be a little
upset about the goat.

59:40.926 --> 59:41.757
Hello?

59:41.759 --> 59:43.092
Hey, it's me.

59:43.094 --> 59:44.594
We're heading to the
airport right now,

59:44.596 --> 59:46.228
we're catching a red-eye

59:46.230 --> 59:49.799
because I'm playing a last
minute festival in Sweden.

59:49.801 --> 59:52.636
Well, everything's
great over here.

59:52.638 --> 59:53.603
We got a goat.

59:53.605 --> 59:54.737
How's Mom?

59:54.739 --> 59:57.074
Oh, you know, dating.

59:57.076 --> 59:59.009
Huh, very funny.

59:59.011 --> 01:00:01.645
Look, just make sure
she's happy, all right,

01:00:01.647 --> 01:00:04.313
'cause this is, like, a
really tough time for her.

01:00:04.315 --> 01:00:07.783
Obviously.

01:00:07.785 --> 01:00:09.853
Well, she hung up on me.

01:00:09.855 --> 01:00:10.987
Okay, you know what?

01:00:10.989 --> 01:00:15.158
You and, just
meditate or something.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.159
But I really wanted you to
drive me around blindfolded

01:00:17.161 --> 01:00:18.997
- and then...
- Monty, just stop.

01:00:20.966 --> 01:00:23.100
Come on, let's go outside.

01:00:23.102 --> 01:00:24.971
I can't work in
this environment.

01:00:29.908 --> 01:00:30.743
Hey.

01:00:33.812 --> 01:00:36.379
Oh, hey, hey, ho, oh, ah,
hello, hello, hi, hello.

01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:39.716
Let's not point weapons.

01:00:39.718 --> 01:00:41.183
You okay?

01:00:41.185 --> 01:00:43.252
Sorry.

01:00:43.254 --> 01:00:44.687
It's a bad day.

01:00:44.689 --> 01:00:46.158
Need to blow off some steam?

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:52.328
I think
I'm gonna die.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:53.663
No, no, no,
you're fine, you're fine.

01:00:53.665 --> 01:00:54.397
You've got this, okay?

01:00:54.399 --> 01:00:55.998
- Just stay focused.
- Okay.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.435
What are you gonna do
when you're on Everest

01:00:58.437 --> 01:01:00.073
and it's life or death?

01:01:01.707 --> 01:01:04.676
Sorry, uh, high stakes, high
stakes is what I meant to say.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:07.844
Can you just help me down?

01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:09.011
No, no, no, hold on,
you got this, okay?

01:01:09.013 --> 01:01:10.716
You sure you don't wanna stay?

01:01:16.955 --> 01:01:18.120
Uh.

01:01:18.122 --> 01:01:21.627
Um,
it's, uh, it's stuck.

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:27.096
You can't tell
me that wasn't fun.

01:01:27.098 --> 01:01:29.732
Tell me it helped a little.

01:01:29.734 --> 01:01:30.969
Yeah, a little.

01:01:32.404 --> 01:01:34.804
You combine this with
some real mountain hiking

01:01:34.806 --> 01:01:36.908
and you'll be a pro in no time.

01:01:38.843 --> 01:01:40.743
Well, I'm not
looking to win awards.

01:01:40.745 --> 01:01:42.981
I just gotta find my dad.

01:01:48.986 --> 01:01:49.821
Yeah.

01:01:50.823 --> 01:01:51.658
Yeah.

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:55.725
I mean, he's still out there,
they just haven't found him,

01:01:55.727 --> 01:01:57.060
which is dumb.

01:01:57.062 --> 01:01:58.895
I mean, considering
the technology

01:01:58.897 --> 01:02:02.335
and whatever else it is
that they have out there.

01:02:05.971 --> 01:02:06.572
Question.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.375
What are you doing tonight?

01:02:11.143 --> 01:02:12.808
What, like, later?

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:14.176
Yes.

01:02:15.013 --> 01:02:15.848
Uh.

01:02:17.415 --> 01:02:19.850
Um, nothing.

01:02:19.852 --> 01:02:20.817
Perfect.

01:02:20.819 --> 01:02:21.784
Meet me here at seven.

01:02:21.786 --> 01:02:25.020
Oh, and I'm assuming
that you like Chinese?

01:02:25.022 --> 01:02:26.422
People or food?

01:02:26.424 --> 01:02:27.259
Ooh, both.

01:02:39.036 --> 01:02:39.870
Lindsey,
it's Michael.

01:02:39.872 --> 01:02:40.904
Call me back, please.

01:02:40.906 --> 01:02:42.442
We've got unfinished business.

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:48.448
All right, you got any tens?

01:02:49.848 --> 01:02:51.515
You're cheating me, you
ruble headed, son of a...

01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:53.453
Watch your mouth.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.988
A lady in the office.

01:02:57.855 --> 01:02:59.357
Sorry about the
language, Lindsey.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.295
Lord, you look like you been
rode hard and hung up wet.

01:03:05.297 --> 01:03:06.899
What's got your
feathers ruffled?

01:03:08.232 --> 01:03:10.135
Can we go somewhere
private and talk?

01:03:14.506 --> 01:03:17.540
Sure.

01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:18.844
I know just the place.

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:23.950
It's a shame they're corralled.

01:03:25.884 --> 01:03:27.420
On the reservation,
they run free.

01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:31.922
Let me guess, you
tame wild horses

01:03:31.924 --> 01:03:34.794
and then use them to communicate
with your spirit guide.

01:03:35.928 --> 01:03:37.830
I rescued them from
an animal hoarder.

01:03:39.297 --> 01:03:40.132
Oh.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.871
Look, your mother's
definitely got my attention.

01:03:46.571 --> 01:03:47.904
I don't want you to
get the wrong idea

01:03:47.906 --> 01:03:49.873
about the other day.

01:03:49.875 --> 01:03:52.107
When my dad gets back,
you're gonna be sorry.

01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:53.512
I can take care of her, Linds.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.312
I can love her.

01:03:56.314 --> 01:03:57.346
Ain't that what your
daddy would have wanted?

01:03:57.348 --> 01:03:58.551
For her to be cared for?

01:04:00.152 --> 01:04:01.884
You're serious?

01:04:01.886 --> 01:04:02.888
Always am.

01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:05.924
You totally played me.

01:04:07.225 --> 01:04:10.359
And now you're trying
to screw my mom.

01:04:10.361 --> 01:04:13.864
I thought Troy Thunderton
was about honor and respect.

01:04:13.866 --> 01:04:16.600
Look, I don't play games,
all right, I don't have to.

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:17.868
Troy Thunderton was a legend.

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:19.335
I've got two Emmys,
remember that?

01:04:19.337 --> 01:04:20.540
Oh, shut up.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.375
You had a shitty
regional kids show.

01:04:26.477 --> 01:04:27.911
I wish I never met you.

01:04:27.913 --> 01:04:30.045
Well, why don't
you wish in one hand

01:04:30.047 --> 01:04:30.980
and spit in the other?

01:04:30.982 --> 01:04:32.852
See which one fills up faster.

01:04:34.051 --> 01:04:36.288
I'm in love and I
ain't going anywhere.

01:04:37.622 --> 01:04:38.955
Lightning can strike twice.

01:04:38.957 --> 01:04:40.656
My people got stories
to prove that.

01:04:40.658 --> 01:04:42.292
Oh, shut up.

01:04:42.294 --> 01:04:43.560
You're Irish.

01:04:43.562 --> 01:04:45.431
I read you damn Wikipedia page.

01:04:51.502 --> 01:04:52.669
So, Lindsey,

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:54.337
what exactly are
your financial goals?

01:04:54.339 --> 01:04:57.109
I need about $10,000.

01:04:59.277 --> 01:05:00.210
Did you know

01:05:00.212 --> 01:05:01.280
that your account is overdrawn?

01:05:02.314 --> 01:05:03.446
Wait, what?

01:05:03.448 --> 01:05:05.584
No, there should be, like,
$8 in there or something.

01:05:07.185 --> 01:05:09.188
Did you make a
purchase for $18.99?

01:05:13.292 --> 01:05:14.960
Goat food, damn it.

01:05:16.661 --> 01:05:21.031
Okay, okay, just take whatever
you need out of my deposit

01:05:21.033 --> 01:05:22.531
and then, I don't know,

01:05:22.533 --> 01:05:24.970
open up a line of credit
or something for the rest?

01:05:30.942 --> 01:05:32.011
You know what?

01:05:35.047 --> 01:05:36.946
Why don't we start here first?

01:05:36.948 --> 01:05:38.415
There's some good stuff in there

01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:39.886
and it's a really quick read.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.455
Oh.

01:05:47.024 --> 01:05:48.393
And you might need those.

01:05:49.962 --> 01:05:51.197
Would you like a receipt?

01:06:03.007 --> 01:06:04.009
How's your hot mother?

01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:06.011
Hot as hell.

01:06:07.212 --> 01:06:09.679
It's nice to see your sense
of humor is still intact.

01:06:09.681 --> 01:06:12.184
Which reminds me, Lindsey,
I need your spare keys.

01:06:13.151 --> 01:06:15.018
I lost them.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:15.655
Lindsey.

01:06:17.055 --> 01:06:18.620
I'm gonna add that
to your tab, okay?

01:06:18.622 --> 01:06:19.656
I'm working on it.

01:06:19.658 --> 01:06:20.593
Are you working?

01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:23.426
You finally got a job?

01:06:23.428 --> 01:06:25.931
After three whole
years of doing squat?

01:06:27.198 --> 01:06:28.431
I'm proud of you, Lindsey.

01:06:28.433 --> 01:06:30.033
- Okay, knock it off.
- Is it a real job?

01:06:30.035 --> 01:06:31.301
You know what?

01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:32.768
I've had to help out
at the house a lot.

01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:34.737
My father didn't leave a
fat inheritance like yours.

01:06:34.739 --> 01:06:37.540
Well, yeah, that's true.

01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:38.444
- Classy.
- Okay.

01:06:42.747 --> 01:06:43.682
I need $10,000.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.788
Okay, honestly, I need 11,641

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.125
but I think I can make
things work with 10,000.

01:06:55.127 --> 01:06:58.194
All right, 11,641,
that's better.

01:06:58.196 --> 01:07:00.029
Open lines of
communication, please.

01:07:00.031 --> 01:07:01.163
Let's be honest
with one another.

01:07:01.165 --> 01:07:04.266
No, are you kidding me, no.

01:07:04.268 --> 01:07:07.036
Michael, come on, I've
never asked you for anything.

01:07:07.038 --> 01:07:09.075
Just give me this one thing.

01:07:12.777 --> 01:07:15.547
I will, on one condition.

01:07:25.489 --> 01:07:26.993
I want these signed.

01:07:28.194 --> 01:07:30.826
My accountant says the sooner
the divorce is finalized,

01:07:30.828 --> 01:07:32.631
the sooner I can cut my losses.

01:07:34.698 --> 01:07:35.567
Lucky you.

01:07:37.768 --> 01:07:40.402
I'm not even gonna ask
you what the money is for.

01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:43.109
If you're in some kind
of trouble, I don't care.

01:07:44.176 --> 01:07:46.375
Don't care.

01:07:46.377 --> 01:07:48.210
It's not like that.

01:07:48.212 --> 01:07:51.181
Uh-huh, and if
this is what it takes

01:07:51.183 --> 01:07:52.752
for you to start a
new life without me,

01:07:55.152 --> 01:07:56.122
I'm cool with that.

01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:02.692
Michael,
this is only 5,500.

01:08:02.694 --> 01:08:04.460
You bet it is.

01:08:04.462 --> 01:08:07.596
I subtracted your half of
the expenses from that.

01:08:07.598 --> 01:08:08.797
Like lost keys,

01:08:08.799 --> 01:08:12.301
a cell phone bill that is still
in my name for some reason

01:08:12.303 --> 01:08:15.105
and has to be paid every month.

01:08:15.107 --> 01:08:18.176
I'm not even counting your
half of the honeymoon.

01:08:20.178 --> 01:08:22.212
You're ridiculous.

01:08:22.214 --> 01:08:23.812
As far as I'm concerned,

01:08:23.814 --> 01:08:25.647
this marriage never
even happened.

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:27.883
It's all just a write-off.

01:08:27.885 --> 01:08:30.685
Aw, like law school
never happened?

01:08:30.688 --> 01:08:32.788
I'm working
big cases Lindsey.

01:08:32.791 --> 01:08:34.223
You're a court reporter.

01:08:34.225 --> 01:08:34.794
No, I'm not.

01:08:36.228 --> 01:08:37.529
I'm at a firm.

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:41.462
Congratulations
on your internship.

01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:44.167
Congratulations on your aah!

01:08:44.169 --> 01:08:45.334
You know, I have
some advice for you.

01:08:45.336 --> 01:08:46.569
I'm not taking advice

01:08:46.571 --> 01:08:49.606
from somebody more
screwed up than me.

01:08:56.613 --> 01:09:01.584
But if you wanted
to fool around,

01:09:01.586 --> 01:09:04.154
I'd be happy to cut
you a bigger check.

01:09:04.156 --> 01:09:06.923
Stop.

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:07.827
Stop.

01:09:10.828 --> 01:09:14.863
The next time I see you,
I want these papers signed.

01:09:14.866 --> 01:09:16.533
Right.

01:09:16.535 --> 01:09:20.234
And get the rest of your
shit out of here, please.

01:09:20.237 --> 01:09:21.904
I don't wanna have to
take it to Goodwill.

01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:22.841
Okay, okay, fine.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:31.584
I guess I'll just get the
rest of my stuff later.

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.287
I hate leaving like this.

01:09:57.442 --> 01:09:59.645
Planning on
doing some baking tonight?

01:10:01.712 --> 01:10:02.547
Yeah.

01:10:03.715 --> 01:10:05.451
Poison flavored anything.

01:10:07.618 --> 01:10:08.821
Heavy on the deadly.

01:10:11.855 --> 01:10:16.862
Sweetheart, I am not trying
to replace your father.

01:10:17.729 --> 01:10:19.265
No one could ever replace him.

01:10:21.599 --> 01:10:25.701
I'm just enjoying Jerry's
company, that's all.

01:10:25.703 --> 01:10:26.938
We're having fun.

01:10:28.672 --> 01:10:29.908
He's a sweet guy.

01:10:33.377 --> 01:10:34.212
Great.

01:10:35.479 --> 01:10:37.246
Here, enjoy.

01:10:37.248 --> 01:10:38.481
We're all caught

01:10:38.483 --> 01:10:40.486
between a rock and a
hard place now, honey.

01:10:41.786 --> 01:10:43.522
Shit, rocks.

01:10:54.733 --> 01:10:57.633
Hey, man, I don't
think she's coming.

01:10:57.635 --> 01:10:59.901
Okay, I'll be down
in just a minute.

01:10:59.903 --> 01:11:03.873
Do you want to take some
kung pao chicken with you?

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:05.877
I kinda have a lot of it.

01:11:07.746 --> 01:11:08.811
Sure.

01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:02.498
Are you like this all the time

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.801
or you just save it for me?

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:06.335
Just because your
life hit rock-bottom

01:12:06.337 --> 01:12:09.007
doesn't mean you gotta drag
the rest of us down with you.

01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:13.345
You know, I think
I'll stay right here

01:12:14.412 --> 01:12:16.445
and make your life miserable.

01:12:16.447 --> 01:12:18.380
That's fine with me.

01:12:18.382 --> 01:12:20.415
Ain't gonna keep me
from loving your mother.

01:12:20.417 --> 01:12:22.785
I am going to squeeze
the life out of you

01:12:22.787 --> 01:12:25.391
like a smelly sponge.

01:12:27.658 --> 01:12:30.028
You can catch more
flies with sugar, Linds.

01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:33.128
Why don't you just try
being nice for a change

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:34.399
and see what happens?

01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:37.533
Your mom deserves to be
with a man who loves her

01:12:37.535 --> 01:12:40.406
just the way she is and
I intend to be that man.

01:12:43.108 --> 01:12:45.775
The fact that you pretend
to be Native American

01:12:45.777 --> 01:12:49.645
is really just arrogant.

01:12:49.647 --> 01:12:51.649
People protest
this kind of stuff.

01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:56.355
All right.

01:13:14.572 --> 01:13:16.606
How much do you think we
could get for your computer?

01:13:16.608 --> 01:13:18.074
To pay for for Sam?

01:13:18.076 --> 01:13:19.008
Huh?

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:20.112
My mentor, I named him Sam.

01:13:21.779 --> 01:13:23.713
We could probably get a few
hundred bucks for my laptop.

01:13:23.715 --> 01:13:26.015
And then maybe if we have
some more money left over...

01:13:26.017 --> 01:13:28.086
Yeah, we can get something
for Mom, okay, whatever.

01:13:29.487 --> 01:13:30.121
Okay.

01:13:31.188 --> 01:13:33.455
So, how do we get more money?

01:13:33.457 --> 01:13:37.727
Well, we used to swing by
the local homeless shelter,

01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:39.462
get some transients,
put 'em in a van,

01:13:39.464 --> 01:13:41.496
take 'em around all
the other dealerships.

01:13:41.498 --> 01:13:43.432
Then they'd go and flush
out all the customers

01:13:43.434 --> 01:13:45.000
like varmints out of the brush,

01:13:45.002 --> 01:13:46.636
and they'd come
over here to our lot

01:13:46.638 --> 01:13:47.872
just spend like crazy.

01:13:49.206 --> 01:13:52.441
Or, you remember
those late night

01:13:52.443 --> 01:13:54.075
lonely girls looking
to hook up commercials?

01:13:54.077 --> 01:13:56.080
Monty, go do something
else right now.

01:13:57.948 --> 01:14:01.683
Say anything to my brother
ever again and I swear to God,

01:14:01.685 --> 01:14:04.186
I'll stab you in the
neck with a tampon.

01:14:04.188 --> 01:14:08.393
Somebody needs one of Uncle
Wally's magic rum oranges.

01:14:26.144 --> 01:14:29.512
Excuse me, is there
something I can help you with?

01:14:29.514 --> 01:14:32.048
Uh, you know,
Scott was helping me.

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:33.583
Is he around?

01:14:33.585 --> 01:14:35.884
No, he called in sick today.

01:14:35.886 --> 01:14:37.488
Oh, oh, okay.

01:14:38.223 --> 01:14:39.625
Yeah, he's never sick.

01:14:49.934 --> 01:14:51.167
I really
feel I'm ready,

01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:53.235
like I can use my
gift to help others.

01:14:53.237 --> 01:14:54.669
Yeah?

01:14:54.671 --> 01:14:55.670
What kind of feeling are
you getting about Dad?

01:14:55.672 --> 01:14:57.940
- Oh, Lindsey, enough.
- Why?

01:14:57.942 --> 01:15:00.575
Is it interrupting
your dating life?

01:15:00.577 --> 01:15:01.878
If you don't like
it, you can leave.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.646
Monty, I need you
to take these boxes

01:15:03.648 --> 01:15:04.914
to GoodWill tomorrow, okay?

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:07.953
It's just some old
clothes and stuff.

01:15:13.257 --> 01:15:14.193
These are Dad's.

01:15:15.593 --> 01:15:17.959
I am keeping things,
Lindsey, don't worry.

01:15:17.961 --> 01:15:19.227
I just need to get rid of...

01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:20.064
Get rid of Dad.

01:15:24.301 --> 01:15:26.205
It's fine, I'll take
care of it myself.

01:15:43.287 --> 01:15:45.954
And we're live with
Dr. Montgomery Lou

01:15:45.956 --> 01:15:47.789
as he discusses
saving the world,

01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:49.292
one remote village at a time.

01:15:49.294 --> 01:15:52.294
Dr. Lou, tell us about
your next adventure.

01:15:52.296 --> 01:15:53.831
I'm trying to be serious.

01:15:55.567 --> 01:15:57.999
Well, sounds
like I should film then.

01:15:58.001 --> 01:15:59.237
If you're being serious.

01:16:06.743 --> 01:16:10.748
I mean it,
this is the last time.

01:16:12.584 --> 01:16:13.783
Your mother and I
love you very much,

01:16:13.785 --> 01:16:16.151
but you're never going
to learn anything

01:16:16.153 --> 01:16:18.290
if we don't stop doing this.

01:16:20.724 --> 01:16:22.758
Why don't you
take me with you then?

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.627
On your next adventure?

01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:26.628
It'll be so much fun.

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:27.629
I can be your assistant.

01:16:27.631 --> 01:16:28.763
You wanna
go on my next adventure?

01:16:28.765 --> 01:16:30.665
Mm-hmm.

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:33.802
What
if it's too dangerous?

01:16:33.804 --> 01:16:36.638
I should
probably stay here then, huh?

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.708
In case I have to
bail you out, right?

01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:40.610
Right.

01:16:40.612 --> 01:16:42.712
What are you doing?

01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:54.326
Hey.

01:16:55.859 --> 01:16:57.194
Hey.

01:17:00.764 --> 01:17:03.000
Did you know Jerry
likes to go camping?

01:17:06.737 --> 01:17:08.339
He said we could
all go to Wyoming.

01:17:11.876 --> 01:17:14.377
He's got this cabin
up in Carbon County.

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:16.180
He said we could all go fishing.

01:17:21.085 --> 01:17:22.220
He's pretty cool.

01:17:23.354 --> 01:17:28.660
I mean, not Dad cool, but
different cool, you know?

01:17:29.426 --> 01:17:31.263
He's a total fake.

01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:40.605
He said you're just upset
about Dad and you can't move on.

01:17:41.205 --> 01:17:42.274
Can't move on?

01:17:44.341 --> 01:17:45.775
Monty, I'm not gonna move on

01:17:45.777 --> 01:17:48.614
until I have proof that
Dad is really gone.

01:17:52.183 --> 01:17:54.417
Nobody can prove
that psychics are real

01:17:54.419 --> 01:17:59.625
but I believe because
I can feel it,

01:18:02.426 --> 01:18:03.694
and that's proof.

01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:06.398
I've got enough
proof right here.

01:18:08.465 --> 01:18:12.468
It's good for you, but
your psychic abilities

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.373
aren't helping us
bring Dad back.

01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:22.980
Jerry says that courage
is being scared to death

01:18:23.915 --> 01:18:25.283
and saddling up anyway.

01:18:28.286 --> 01:18:29.321
Jerry said that?

01:18:30.487 --> 01:18:32.156
Yeah, he's smart.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.395
And you believe that, Monty?

01:18:41.965 --> 01:18:43.000
Okay.

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.205
Mont, can I have a second?

01:18:48.371 --> 01:18:49.206
Mm-hmm.

01:19:20.904 --> 01:19:23.207
- I'm sorry I've been so...
- I know.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:29.715
I know.

01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:33.819
God, that's hideous.

01:19:34.885 --> 01:19:36.087
Where'd you get it, Grandma?

01:19:37.889 --> 01:19:38.790
Jerry gave it to me.

01:19:54.805 --> 01:19:55.840
I'm lonely.

01:19:58.542 --> 01:19:59.478
What about Dad?

01:20:01.946 --> 01:20:03.047
What about him?

01:20:04.514 --> 01:20:06.517
He traveled the world.

01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:09.051
And where was I?

01:20:09.053 --> 01:20:13.021
I was here being a
mom, being a wife.

01:20:13.023 --> 01:20:16.057
And I never
complained, not once,

01:20:16.059 --> 01:20:20.529
because he promised
me when he retired,

01:20:20.531 --> 01:20:25.200
we would travel the world,
see places, do things,

01:20:25.202 --> 01:20:27.205
meet people, live life.

01:20:29.873 --> 01:20:33.010
I put my life on hold for
him and what do I have?

01:20:37.547 --> 01:20:38.450
I'm alone.

01:20:41.117 --> 01:20:43.485
And you would have seen
that, had you been around.

01:20:43.487 --> 01:20:45.190
You didn't want me here.

01:20:46.623 --> 01:20:47.425
What?

01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:50.028
No, that's not true.

01:20:51.095 --> 01:20:52.927
You left.

01:20:52.929 --> 01:20:55.166
You didn't wanna be
part of this family.

01:20:56.867 --> 01:21:00.304
Life does not stop when you
walk out the door, Lindsey.

01:21:03.241 --> 01:21:06.077
After all this time you still
think it's all about you.

01:21:24.895 --> 01:21:26.398
Lindsey, you up yet?

01:21:32.103 --> 01:21:32.938
Lindsey.

01:21:36.006 --> 01:21:36.841
Lindsey.

01:21:37.908 --> 01:21:39.674
- It happened.
- What?

01:21:39.676 --> 01:21:41.677
The community college
is offering a class

01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:43.478
on paranormal studies.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.916
I think I'm going to college.

01:21:47.018 --> 01:21:48.417
Where's Sam?

01:21:48.419 --> 01:21:49.554
Uh, he left.

01:21:50.921 --> 01:21:52.687
Left like he went
to go get coffee,

01:21:52.689 --> 01:21:56.025
or to walk the goat left,
or like he left left?

01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:57.993
Now I can go
to an accredited school

01:21:57.995 --> 01:22:00.029
with real professors
who specialize...

01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:01.664
Where did Sam go?

01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:03.368
He never really talked.

01:22:04.568 --> 01:22:06.371
The bank, maybe,
to cash his check?

01:22:09.674 --> 01:22:10.507
What check?

01:22:12.108 --> 01:22:14.509
I didn't wanna wake you
up, so I wrote him a check.

01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:17.478
But, man, Sam is not cheap.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.013
You could buy a
really fancy aquarium

01:22:19.015 --> 01:22:20.449
with that kinda money.

01:22:20.451 --> 01:22:24.085
Okay, so you what,
you wrote him for what,

01:22:24.087 --> 01:22:25.721
- for everything, for all of it?
- Well, not everything,

01:22:25.723 --> 01:22:26.955
But most of it.

01:22:26.957 --> 01:22:27.789
Why, what's wrong?

01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:30.292
That money wasn't
for Sam or you.

01:22:30.294 --> 01:22:32.061
Yeah, to
help me become psychic.

01:22:32.063 --> 01:22:33.494
No, it was to bring Dad home.

01:22:33.496 --> 01:22:34.762
What?

01:22:34.764 --> 01:22:39.034
Yes, I had plane tickets and
tents and climbing equipment,

01:22:39.036 --> 01:22:41.669
and Sam knew Everest like
the back of his hand.

01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:43.539
You lied to me?

01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:45.341
Monty, just listen

01:22:45.343 --> 01:22:47.743
Okay, come on, even
you said Dad was alive,

01:22:47.745 --> 01:22:49.610
that you heard him, right?

01:22:49.612 --> 01:22:52.681
And what about all that
stuff about good feelings?

01:22:52.683 --> 01:22:54.083
You used me!

01:22:54.085 --> 01:22:56.084
I took a vow to only
use my powers for good.

01:22:56.086 --> 01:22:57.753
Oh, shut up,
you're not psychic!

01:22:57.755 --> 01:22:59.187
Cool it, guys.

01:22:59.189 --> 01:23:00.722
Jerry's coming over.

01:23:00.724 --> 01:23:03.325
Oh, great, this day
keeps getting worse.

01:23:03.327 --> 01:23:06.094
Good, I like Jerry, I can't
wait for him to come over.

01:23:06.096 --> 01:23:07.996
Why, because
he's Troy Thunderton?

01:23:07.998 --> 01:23:09.630
You're the only one who
has a problem with him.

01:23:09.632 --> 01:23:10.766
He's a loser!

01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:12.534
Well, that loser is my guest.

01:23:12.536 --> 01:23:14.436
And can you get that goat
out of the house, please?

01:23:14.438 --> 01:23:16.137
You know, if Dad
was here, he'd let you have it.

01:23:16.139 --> 01:23:17.505
You wanna hear
a psychic vision?

01:23:17.507 --> 01:23:19.173
You and Michael don't
live happily ever after,

01:23:19.175 --> 01:23:20.642
you work a crappy job,

01:23:20.644 --> 01:23:23.544
and you live by yourself with
a bunch of cats, the end!

01:23:23.546 --> 01:23:25.146
And you get really fat.

01:23:25.148 --> 01:23:27.048
You're such a fake!

01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.682
And you know what else?

01:23:27.684 --> 01:23:28.683
Jerry makes Mom happy.

01:23:28.685 --> 01:23:30.619
At least he comes around
more than Dad ever did.

01:23:30.621 --> 01:23:31.489
Shut up!

01:23:32.723 --> 01:23:34.056
You wanna know why
Michael really kicked you out?

01:23:34.058 --> 01:23:35.257
He never kicked me out.

01:23:35.259 --> 01:23:37.058
Oh, yeah, so that's why
you've been living in your car

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.360
for the past two weeks?

01:23:38.362 --> 01:23:40.361
Everyone knows, we've just
been trying to be nice!

01:23:40.363 --> 01:23:42.597
- Bullshit!
- We knew.

01:23:42.599 --> 01:23:44.098
Maybe our lives
are screwed up,

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:45.670
but at least we're
honest about it.

01:23:47.071 --> 01:23:48.536
You act like you're the
only normal one around here

01:23:48.538 --> 01:23:50.705
and you're the one that
needs the most help.

01:23:50.707 --> 01:23:52.040
Monty.

01:23:52.876 --> 01:23:55.511
We do not slam
doors in this house!

01:23:57.281 --> 01:23:58.813
Dammit.

01:23:58.815 --> 01:24:01.450
You lost my cousin,
not my problem, lady.

01:24:01.452 --> 01:24:02.651
He stole my money.

01:24:02.653 --> 01:24:04.119
Hey, you take it up with him.

01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:06.687
You have a signed contract?

01:24:06.689 --> 01:24:07.522
No.

01:24:07.524 --> 01:24:08.790
Not my problem.

01:24:08.792 --> 01:24:10.594
This is between you and him.

01:24:12.563 --> 01:24:13.732
Maybe he's in Hawaii.

01:24:15.366 --> 01:24:18.566
Why would he be in Hawaii?

01:24:18.568 --> 01:24:20.602
It's perfectly
beautiful there.

01:24:20.604 --> 01:24:22.103
Okay.

01:24:22.105 --> 01:24:24.173
You know, you either need
to give me my money back

01:24:24.175 --> 01:24:25.641
or you tell me where he is.

01:24:25.643 --> 01:24:27.843
You need to go now
or I'll call police.

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:30.281
Great, we can file a
missing persons report.

01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:47.599
You done?

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.400
No, I'm shopping.

01:24:51.402 --> 01:24:52.203
Mm.

01:24:53.403 --> 01:24:55.773
Well, orange is a
lovely color on you.

01:24:58.175 --> 01:24:59.842
I'm sorry if I creeped you out

01:24:59.844 --> 01:25:03.111
and invited you for
Chinese food at a gym.

01:25:03.113 --> 01:25:04.448
That's super douchey.

01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:07.449
It's cool.

01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:08.685
It's normal, right?

01:25:09.886 --> 01:25:13.657
Can we go somewhere and talk?

01:25:17.728 --> 01:25:20.098
I'm kinda going through
some stuff right now.

01:25:22.332 --> 01:25:24.835
Okay, well, then
I'm coming in.

01:25:26.237 --> 01:25:28.105
Like it or not, I'm coming in.

01:25:44.255 --> 01:25:46.190
You never really planned
on going, did you?

01:25:50.327 --> 01:25:51.162
I did.

01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:57.836
But my Sherpa ran off, and
my brother's been no help,

01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:03.408
and there's no one
else to support me.

01:26:05.376 --> 01:26:08.346
I mean, besides you.

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.452
You know, I knew your dad.

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.853
He used to come in
here all the time

01:26:18.855 --> 01:26:21.126
and buy a bunch of stuff.

01:26:23.227 --> 01:26:23.862
Yeah.

01:26:26.563 --> 01:26:28.232
I can't wait until
he comes home.

01:26:32.236 --> 01:26:32.871
What if he doesn't?

01:26:35.973 --> 01:26:39.644
It's, like, really rough
out there, Lindsey.

01:26:43.279 --> 01:26:43.915
He will.

01:26:46.282 --> 01:26:47.285
You don't know my dad.

01:26:54.892 --> 01:26:55.827
I hope he does.

01:27:08.471 --> 01:27:09.570
Hey, it's me.

01:27:09.572 --> 01:27:10.874
Hey, Liam, how's Sweden?

01:27:23.687 --> 01:27:25.920
The search efforts for
the remaining two climbers

01:27:25.922 --> 01:27:27.823
from last month's
devastating avalanche

01:27:27.825 --> 01:27:29.391
has come to an end.

01:27:29.393 --> 01:27:31.860
The bodies of two
American geologists

01:27:31.862 --> 01:27:33.861
have been properly identified

01:27:33.863 --> 01:27:36.698
as Mitch Connor
and Montgomery Lou.

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:38.834
Earlier weather conditions
hampered the search

01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:40.535
for the missing climbers.

01:27:40.537 --> 01:27:42.704
Unconfirmed reports
of Lou and Connor

01:27:42.706 --> 01:27:45.641
being found at lower
elevations led to confusion,

01:27:45.643 --> 01:27:49.011
as the locals carried out
traditional cremation ceremonies.

01:29:17.867 --> 01:29:19.101
Monty, I'm
sure you already knew

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:20.069
I'd be giving you this.

01:29:20.071 --> 01:29:23.408
Go to school, develop
your gift, Lindsey.

01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:42.450
Can I help you?

01:30:46.689 --> 01:30:48.522
Lindsey.

01:30:48.524 --> 01:30:49.426
Double check.

01:30:54.497 --> 01:30:55.500
We're good.

01:30:57.835 --> 01:30:59.534
You don't need to do that.

01:30:59.536 --> 01:31:00.171
You, Lindsey.

01:31:03.474 --> 01:31:04.075
Really?

01:31:08.612 --> 01:31:13.584
Don't slam the...

01:33:26.916 --> 01:33:28.283
I'll get it.

01:33:32.656 --> 01:33:33.855
Hello.

01:33:33.857 --> 01:33:34.692
Hey.

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:38.258
I just, um, wanted to
see if Mom is around?

01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:39.095
Come in.

01:33:42.131 --> 01:33:43.397
Oh, hey, Lindsey.

01:33:43.399 --> 01:33:44.466
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:33:44.468 --> 01:33:46.968
We were just talking
about your big promotion.

01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:50.405
Oh, yeah, uh, now they
let me use the cash register

01:33:50.407 --> 01:33:53.040
and wash the dishes.

01:33:53.042 --> 01:33:53.975
Grab a plate in the kitchen.

01:33:53.977 --> 01:33:55.179
We saved you a seat.

01:33:56.647 --> 01:33:58.312
Oh, that's okay,
I already ate.

01:33:58.314 --> 01:34:00.315
I just wanted to say hi.

01:34:00.317 --> 01:34:01.749
No, come on, don't be silly.

01:34:01.751 --> 01:34:03.687
We have so much
food, grab a plate.

01:34:06.422 --> 01:34:07.692
And some ketchup.

01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:20.837
Figured we might
be seeing more of you.

01:34:23.773 --> 01:34:24.608
Been busy.

01:34:25.274 --> 01:34:27.174
Work, you know?

01:34:27.176 --> 01:34:30.445
You've been avoiding me
and your mom like the plague.

01:34:30.447 --> 01:34:31.282
Kinda.

01:34:33.849 --> 01:34:36.086
Your daddy would have
been proud of you, Lindsey.

01:34:37.787 --> 01:34:38.723
I know your mom is.

01:34:41.992 --> 01:34:43.892
You're building a cumulus.

01:34:43.894 --> 01:34:44.729
Hmm?

01:34:45.961 --> 01:34:46.795
A thunderhead.

01:34:48.698 --> 01:34:50.367
Your lightning will
strike, trust me.

01:35:12.322 --> 01:35:13.987
We got rid of the goat.

01:35:13.989 --> 01:35:16.160
He ate Mom's checkbook
and her good towels.

01:35:17.193 --> 01:35:18.826
Figures.

01:35:18.828 --> 01:35:20.762
How's Harvey and Kenny?

01:35:20.764 --> 01:35:22.731
- They're pretty good.
- Yeah?

01:35:58.001 --> 01:35:58.836
Hello?

01:36:01.971 --> 01:36:03.907
Uh, yeah?

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.079
- Uh.
- Everything cool?

01:36:12.081 --> 01:36:15.517
Yeah, I just, um, I've gotta
go take care of something.

01:36:15.519 --> 01:36:17.252
Can it
wait till after you eat?

01:36:17.254 --> 01:36:18.485
Just
let her go, Carol.

01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:20.521
But
you just got here.

01:36:20.523 --> 01:36:22.859
I just gotta
wrap up some business.

01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:51.821
My old man gave me that
watch when I got my PhD.

01:36:53.924 --> 01:36:54.825
That goes to Liam.

01:37:02.299 --> 01:37:05.066
Now, these, I got for Monty.

01:37:05.068 --> 01:37:07.004
That one, you know, obvious.

01:37:09.104 --> 01:37:11.375
This one means
never stop learning.

01:37:14.845 --> 01:37:15.513
He's a smart kid.

01:37:17.413 --> 01:37:20.518
Sees the beauty in the things
that the rest of us miss.

01:37:27.623 --> 01:37:29.492
That's for your mom.

01:37:31.862 --> 01:37:33.998
It's a Tibetan prayer scarf.

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:37.535
Made me think of her.

01:37:39.301 --> 01:37:40.804
She'll understand.

01:37:47.911 --> 01:37:49.180
That's for you.

01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:58.255
I want you to wear that until
you find a guy so amazing

01:38:01.657 --> 01:38:02.926
who loves you

01:38:06.129 --> 01:38:08.098
the way you deserve it.

01:38:16.005 --> 01:38:18.142
Why did you have to leave?

01:38:23.145 --> 01:38:25.482
I'm never gonna leave you.

01:38:27.917 --> 01:38:28.853
Not really.

01:38:33.156 --> 01:38:34.257
I'm your dad.

01:38:48.938 --> 01:38:49.973
Sorry.

01:38:52.675 --> 01:38:53.910
Thank you.

01:39:14.029 --> 01:39:15.465
- I
- love you, kiddo.

01:39:19.068 --> 01:39:20.000
I love you, too.

01:41:02.104 --> 01:41:03.607
Was it worth it?

01:41:05.442 --> 01:41:08.011
So worth it.

01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:23.527
We made it.
