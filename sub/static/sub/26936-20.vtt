WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:03.200
Tonight on The Curse
of Oak Island

00:03.520 --> 00:04.920
Look over there, Marty.

00:04.920 --> 00:06.523
-Is that a wall?
-RICK: Yep.

00:06.723 --> 00:08.390
Yeah, there it is right there.

00:08.390 --> 00:10.140
I think it’s a shaft.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.139
-(beeping)
-I see it!

00:13.139 --> 00:15.590
Yeah, that’s 1700s
all over it, mate.

00:15.590 --> 00:16.940
JAMES:
The Knights Baronet

00:16.940 --> 00:17.940
are connected

00:17.940 --> 00:19.310
to the Knights Templar

00:19.310 --> 00:21.980
and might be responsible
for a treasure buried

00:21.980 --> 00:23.010
on Oak Island.

00:23.010 --> 00:25.680
GARY:
All right, here we go.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.130
-What do you got?
-I don’t know yet,

00:27.130 --> 00:28.710
but it looks shiny!

00:31.010 --> 00:33.250
NARRATOR:
There is an island

00:33.250 --> 00:35.410
in the North Atlantic

00:35.410 --> 00:38.800
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.900 --> 00:39.900
for more than 200 years.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.040
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:45.040 --> 00:47.880
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.880 --> 00:50.960
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.960 --> 00:54.670
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.670 --> 00:57.420
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:57.420 --> 01:02.129
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.390
And, according to legend,

01:04.390 --> 01:06.959
one more will have to die

01:06.959 --> 01:10.949
before the treasure
can be found.

01:12.449 --> 01:14.449
♪ ♪

01:21.149 --> 01:24.260
CRAIG:
It looks like

01:24.260 --> 01:25.260
it’s gonna be a windy day.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.260
RICK:
Yes. Yes.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.200
MARTY: It’s not gonna be
a good time for anybody.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.430
CRAIG:
We’ll see.

01:29.430 --> 01:30.430
(horn honks)

01:30.430 --> 01:32.200
MARTY:
Well, let’s go tell them

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
-the news, Craiger.
-Yep.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.939
NARRATOR:
It is a tense

01:35.939 --> 01:37.109
and critical moment

01:37.109 --> 01:38.990
-on Oak Island...
-Hey, guys.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.180
-RICK: Hey.
-MARTY: Gentlemen.

01:40.180 --> 01:42.920
...as brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:42.920 --> 01:44.979
along with their partner
Craig Tester...

01:44.979 --> 01:46.950
-CRAIG: It’s cold out there.
-...have called

01:46.950 --> 01:49.009
an important meeting
in the war room

01:49.009 --> 01:52.079
to discuss
a troubling new development.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.469
MARTY:
Well...

01:54.469 --> 01:59.590
the operators’ union
is going on strike.

01:59.590 --> 02:01.299
There’s nobody out at...

02:01.299 --> 02:03.950
-up at Money Pit.
-Well, w-wait. What do you mean?

02:03.950 --> 02:05.999
MARTY:
It means we’re going silent

02:05.999 --> 02:06.999
up there,

02:06.999 --> 02:08.538
is what it means, Jack--
nobody to run the crane.

02:08.538 --> 02:12.510
We got the word this morning
that they were on strike.

02:12.510 --> 02:15.090
NARRATOR:
Earlier today, Marty,

02:15.090 --> 02:17.000
Rick and Craig were informed

02:17.000 --> 02:19.550
that the unionized
Nova Scotia crane operators

02:19.550 --> 02:21.880
announced a strike in an effort

02:21.880 --> 02:24.680
to secure higher wages
for its members.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.200
Is it just the crane operators,
or everybody?

02:28.200 --> 02:30.240
It’s always solidarity.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.440
So everybody’s gone.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.010
JACK:
What does that mean

02:34.010 --> 02:35.010
for us, though?

02:35.010 --> 02:36.080
We can’t dig.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.610
Zero dark thirty.

02:37.610 --> 02:39.140
MARTY:
You know,

02:39.140 --> 02:41.690
we’re up against it here.

02:41.690 --> 02:42.710
-Yeah.
-So...

02:42.710 --> 02:44.240
it’s a blow.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.690
It’s a big blow.

02:45.690 --> 02:48.160
RICK:
Because time and weather

02:48.160 --> 02:49.640
is closing in.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.690
NARRATOR:
With only a few weeks left

02:51.690 --> 02:53.860
before the onset of winter,

02:53.860 --> 02:56.980
Rick, Marty and the team
must decide

02:56.980 --> 03:00.070
how to make the best use
of the time they have left,

03:00.070 --> 03:02.040
especially if the strike lasts

03:02.040 --> 03:07.070
what could be
as long as three full weeks.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.550
With this window of time,

03:09.550 --> 03:11.490
we should put it to good use
in Smith’s Cove.

03:11.490 --> 03:13.920
-I mean, it’s important.
-JACK: Yes.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.780
Yes, of course.
I’ve been managing my time

03:15.780 --> 03:18.660
at the wash table to make sure
that we could fit in room

03:18.660 --> 03:21.000
for a fifth can and its spoils.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.780
But if we aren’t gonna do
the fifth can,

03:22.780 --> 03:25.850
I would like to go through
some of the Smith’s Cove stuff.

03:25.850 --> 03:28.130
Jack, that’s music to my ears.

03:28.130 --> 03:29.690
GARY:
So we’re lucky--

03:29.690 --> 03:32.180
we can jump over
to Smith’s Cove and...

03:32.180 --> 03:34.041
-do some more excavating
in that area.

03:34.041 --> 03:35.041
-Yeah. Yeah,

03:35.041 --> 03:36.760
we can see what we come up with.
As far as our work,

03:36.760 --> 03:38.960
it shouldn’t interfere at all.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.960
Yes.

03:39.960 --> 03:40.990
There’s a bunch
of opportunity there

03:40.990 --> 03:42.510
that’s certainly intriguing,

03:42.510 --> 03:45.950
especially in light
of this... minor setback.

03:45.950 --> 03:47.980
MARTY:
All right, so, there is

03:47.980 --> 03:49.490
a lot of work to be done
while we wait

03:49.490 --> 03:51.180
for a decision on the strike.

03:51.180 --> 03:53.180
There’s Smith’s Cove,

03:53.180 --> 03:54.960
-to continue excavation.
-Absolutely.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.160
There’s a bunch
of cuttings to wash.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.410
-Jack, get suited up.
-Yep.

03:59.410 --> 04:01.320
Treasure hunting,
and life in general,

04:01.320 --> 04:03.590
one door closes,
another good one opens.

04:03.590 --> 04:06.250
They said that to Churchill
when he didn’t get elected.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.370
They said,

04:07.370 --> 04:09.040
and he said,

04:09.040 --> 04:11.700
"Well, it is very truly
well disguised."

04:11.700 --> 04:12.700
(laughter)

04:12.700 --> 04:16.089
I think at this point,
we have a lot of data.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.168
It’s like Mom putting
a puzzle together--

04:18.168 --> 04:20.019
you can’t see the picture
till the puzzle’s together.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.690
And I think
the puzzle’s not done yet.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.580
The situation
has given us lemons,

04:23.580 --> 04:25.409
and we’re gonna try
and make lemonade out of it.

04:25.409 --> 04:26.729
I think there are
some answers here

04:26.729 --> 04:29.790
and very much look forward to...
to doing that work.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.590
I was prepared for seawater.

04:31.590 --> 04:33.370
I was prepared for hurricane.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.080
I was prepared for collapse.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.009
I was prepared
for equipment breakdown.

04:37.009 --> 04:40.360
I was prepared for all manners
in which the curse could get us,

04:40.360 --> 04:43.460
but I was not thinking
about a strike.

04:43.460 --> 04:44.960
So it’s interesting how...

04:44.960 --> 04:47.919
how the island just...
just throws you something.

04:47.919 --> 04:49.389
But you know what?

04:49.389 --> 04:51.219
We are gonna...
sempre avanti.

04:51.219 --> 04:52.689
We’re gonna move forward.

04:52.689 --> 04:54.259
We’re gonna just deal
with the facts,

04:54.259 --> 04:55.900
and we’re gonna see
what we can do.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.430
So, let’s get back after it.

04:57.430 --> 05:01.150
RICK:
I hope we find the one thing.

05:01.150 --> 05:03.259
NARRATOR:
Following their meeting

05:03.259 --> 05:05.199
in the war room,

05:05.199 --> 05:07.990
Rick and Marty,
along with Charles Barkhouse

05:07.990 --> 05:10.130
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

05:10.130 --> 05:12.659
head to Smith’s Cove.

05:12.659 --> 05:16.430
Here, heavy equipment operator
Billy Gerhardt,

05:16.430 --> 05:17.430
continues to expose

05:17.430 --> 05:19.960
a mysterious wood structure
which was discovered

05:19.960 --> 05:23.729
while searching for the
so-called "convergence point,"

05:23.729 --> 05:27.059
the place where the five
stone flood box drains meet

05:27.059 --> 05:29.939
and which, if found,
could lead directly

05:29.939 --> 05:31.710
to the Money Pit
treasure vault.

05:31.710 --> 05:34.919
-Look. Look over there, Marty.
-GARY: Yeah.

05:34.919 --> 05:37.210
RICK:
Look at how it’s

05:37.210 --> 05:38.761
peeling that away. See that?

05:38.761 --> 05:39.840
Just sticking out. You can just
see the end of it, right there.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.319
-Yeah, there’s a round...
-Like a 2x4.

05:41.319 --> 05:44.979
There’s a round-- see that
round thing over there, Rick.

05:44.979 --> 05:48.169
-GARY: That’s like a log.
-Whoa!

05:48.169 --> 05:50.569
GARY:
Yeah, there’s timbers

05:50.569 --> 05:51.569
all over there.

05:51.569 --> 05:53.120
MARTY:
Yeah, I would dig back

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
behind there.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.310
If they were trying to stop
something, it’s that way.

05:57.310 --> 05:58.729
NARRATOR:
When this structure

05:58.729 --> 06:01.039
was first unearthed
two days ago,

06:01.039 --> 06:04.009
the team was uncertain
whether it was constructed

06:04.009 --> 06:07.960
within the past 200 years by
one of the many search teams,

06:07.960 --> 06:10.490
or one
of the original depositors,

06:10.490 --> 06:14.130
sometime before 1795.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.229
The water is coming
right here, for sure.

06:16.229 --> 06:18.059
-See it pouring right there.
-Yeah.

06:18.059 --> 06:19.280
NARRATOR:
Equally intriguing

06:19.280 --> 06:20.280
is the question

06:20.280 --> 06:22.080
of its intended purpose,

06:22.080 --> 06:25.009
as the steady flow of water
running directly through it

06:25.009 --> 06:28.129
seems to suggest that it
may have some connection

06:28.129 --> 06:29.949
to the flood tunnel system.

06:29.949 --> 06:32.779
GARY:
When’s the last time

06:32.779 --> 06:33.779
this saw the light of day?

06:33.779 --> 06:34.779
MARTY:
Yeah.

06:34.779 --> 06:36.729
GARY:
It’s amazing how many structures

06:36.729 --> 06:38.830
-are still down there.
-MARTY: Yeah.

06:38.830 --> 06:42.240
-GARY: Is this a known one?
-No.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.169
MARTY:
Another of many structures

06:44.169 --> 06:45.979
in Smith’s Cove that
we didn’t know were there.

06:45.979 --> 06:48.419
There are probably upwards,
or getting close to,

06:48.419 --> 06:50.139
a dozen at this point.

06:50.139 --> 06:51.139
Some of which were known

06:51.139 --> 06:53.439
and many of which were unknown,
at least to us.

06:53.439 --> 06:55.469
People didn’t keep
very good records.

06:55.469 --> 06:56.969
Could be a shaft.

06:56.969 --> 06:59.979
-CHARLES: Could be.
-Well, couldn’t it be Restall?

06:59.979 --> 07:01.960
He did some shafts down here.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.990
Oh, yeah. We know
he did dig a number of pits

07:04.990 --> 07:07.139
along the shore trying
to find the converging point.

07:07.139 --> 07:08.659
MARTY:
It’d be nice

07:08.659 --> 07:09.659
if Restall had found

07:09.659 --> 07:11.780
the flood tunnel and tried
to block it right there.

07:11.780 --> 07:12.780
Exactly.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.820
NARRATOR:
In 1959,

07:16.520 --> 07:18.520
motorcycle daredevil-
turned-treasure hunter

07:18.520 --> 07:22.360
Robert Restall,
along with his wife Mildred,

07:22.360 --> 07:24.800
moved to Oak Island
with their two young sons,

07:24.800 --> 07:27.639
Bobby Jr. and Ricky.

07:27.639 --> 07:29.789
For six years,
the family endured

07:29.789 --> 07:33.919
primitive living conditions and
harsh North Atlantic weather,

07:33.919 --> 07:36.900
all while conducting major
search operations in the swamp

07:36.900 --> 07:40.639
at the Money Pit
and at Smith’s Cove.

07:40.639 --> 07:44.240
I feel that
the treasure is here

07:44.240 --> 07:45.270
and that we can get it,

07:45.270 --> 07:48.219
and we’re going to stay here
until we do.

07:48.219 --> 07:50.710
NARRATOR:
In 1965,

07:50.710 --> 07:53.110
Robert Restall claimed

07:53.110 --> 07:56.539
he was close to finding the key
to shutting off the water

07:56.539 --> 07:58.469
that thwarted
searcher efforts to locate

07:58.469 --> 08:01.580
the original Money Pit and,
for this reason,

08:01.580 --> 08:04.800
was within weeks of solving
the Oak Island mystery.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.840
Unfortunately,
later that summer,

08:08.840 --> 08:11.879
Robert Restall,
his son Bobby Jr.

08:11.879 --> 08:15.119
and two coworkers
died in a tragic accident

08:15.119 --> 08:17.360
in one of the many
exploratory shafts

08:17.360 --> 08:20.720
they had dug near Smith’s Cove.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.649
Could the shaft that
Billy Gerhardt has uncovered

08:24.649 --> 08:26.830
be the one
that Robert Restall believed

08:26.830 --> 08:30.259
might be instrumental in
solving the Oak Island mystery?

08:30.259 --> 08:32.750
RICK:
I find the Restall work

08:32.750 --> 08:34.200
to be exceedingly interesting.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.260
They didn’t just
arbitrarily pick locations.

08:36.260 --> 08:39.940
-They chose them for a reason.
-I’m hoping that...

08:39.940 --> 08:41.820
that it really is
a structure to stop

08:41.820 --> 08:44.590
the water that they thought was
flooding the Money Pit.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.320
Ends right there.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.520
Then it goes back that way.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.010
I think it’s a shaft.

08:51.010 --> 08:53.210
But, I mean, we’ll see
when we get down deeper.

08:53.210 --> 08:55.152
Yeah, there it is right there.

08:55.152 --> 08:56.752
-You got a wall, Rick?
-Yep.

08:56.752 --> 08:57.752
Right there.

08:58.052 --> 09:01.020
You are right, Marty.
It’s a shaft. Wow.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.040
-I see it!
-This is military.

09:08.140 --> 09:11.830
Yeah, that’s 1700s
all over it, mate.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.930
It could literally be
a half a billion dollars

09:13.930 --> 09:16.980
in treasure buried
on Oak Island.

09:16.980 --> 09:19.921
CHARLES:
That’s really

09:19.921 --> 09:21.720
pouring out now. Look.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.580
NARRATOR:
At Smith’s Cove,

09:23.580 --> 09:26.010
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

09:26.010 --> 09:28.080
along with Charles Barkhouse,

09:28.080 --> 09:30.690
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

09:30.690 --> 09:34.200
and heavy equipment operator
Billy Gerhardt are continuing

09:34.200 --> 09:38.180
to expose an old wooden shaft
at the edge of the beach.

09:38.180 --> 09:41.750
It is a shaft the team believes
may have been dug

09:41.750 --> 09:44.120
by legendary searcher
Robert Restall

09:44.120 --> 09:46.210
more than 50 years ago

09:46.210 --> 09:47.700
and which
could lead them directly

09:47.700 --> 09:50.740
to the original Money Pit
treasure shaft.

09:50.740 --> 09:53.720
RICK:
Right there.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.870
Is there another wall
going back there, Rick?

09:55.870 --> 09:58.450
Yep. The wall
goes back like that.

09:58.450 --> 10:00.020
It’s right here...

10:00.020 --> 10:01.590
but it’s way...

10:01.590 --> 10:05.240
-Yeah, I see that.
-...way back there.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.330
It’s not very square.

10:07.330 --> 10:08.330
No.

10:08.330 --> 10:09.950
No, not at all.

10:09.950 --> 10:12.750
Definitely ends right there.

10:12.750 --> 10:15.690
They feel they were close
to something.

10:15.690 --> 10:18.420
Perhaps they put the shaft
through the flood tunnel.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.400
-Could be.
-And that’s why we’re

10:20.400 --> 10:22.050
getting all the water in.

10:22.050 --> 10:23.340
RICK:
I think it’s, uh,

10:23.340 --> 10:24.490
part of the Restalls’ work,

10:24.490 --> 10:27.420
to come to an understanding
of... of, you know,

10:27.420 --> 10:28.840
what had been done
in Smith’s Cove.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.140
I mean, there’s still a lot
of questions to be answered

10:31.140 --> 10:33.370
by a simple process
of excavating.

10:33.370 --> 10:34.540
Yeah, but it’s
the most interesting

10:34.540 --> 10:37.030
of the new structures.
Of the unknown structures,

10:37.030 --> 10:38.590
to me,
it’s the most interesting.

10:38.590 --> 10:40.940
-It’s a rather small shaft.
-CHARLES: It is.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.440
RICK:
Unless it was small

10:42.440 --> 10:43.440
because they thought

10:43.440 --> 10:46.020
-they were dead-on something.
-CHARLES: Right on it, yeah.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.020
Well, the interesting thing is,
we’re still seeing water

10:48.020 --> 10:49.730
coming out,
and that’s where water

10:49.730 --> 10:52.060
was coming out
at the end of the crane pad.

10:52.060 --> 10:55.760
And it did... it tested
a little bit of dye here, right?

10:55.760 --> 10:57.340
NARRATOR:
Five weeks ago...

10:57.340 --> 10:59.420
Okay, hit the button.
Start it up.

10:59.420 --> 11:00.780
-Okay.
-...the Oak Island team

11:00.780 --> 11:01.780
conducted

11:01.780 --> 11:04.560
a test at the Money Pit site,
which involved pumping

11:04.560 --> 11:06.840
thousands of gallons
of ocean water,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.560
mixed with nontoxic red dye,
into borehole C-1.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.010
MARTY (over radio):
The dye has been cast.

11:13.010 --> 11:14.720
NARRATOR:
They were hoping to locate

11:14.720 --> 11:16.220
the fabled flood tunnel

11:16.220 --> 11:18.930
believed to be connected
to the treasure shaft.

11:18.930 --> 11:23.300
If we’re looking for red, guys,
I’d say that’s red.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.300
NARRATOR:
Within hours

11:24.300 --> 11:26.270
of beginning the dye test,

11:26.270 --> 11:29.110
Gary Drayton alerted Rick,
Marty and the team

11:29.110 --> 11:31.040
to what appeared
to be red-colored water

11:31.040 --> 11:33.030
flowing out of Smith’s Cove

11:33.030 --> 11:34.240
near where
they are currently digging

11:34.240 --> 11:37.810
water,
which then tested positive

11:37.810 --> 11:39.560
for traces of the red dye.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
-11.98.
-Whew.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.480
That’s a good positive
indication.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.470
Well, here-here’s the thing.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.220
Steve Guptill’s gonna be here
tomorrow,

11:47.220 --> 11:49.970
so he has
that red dye position GPS’d.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.800
-Okay.
-He can GPS this, overlay it,

11:52.800 --> 11:54.280
or-or at least compare and see

11:54.280 --> 11:56.170
-how close we are to that.
-Yeah.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.630
And then, given the fact

11:57.630 --> 12:01.140
that the Restalls were certainly
interested in this area,

12:01.140 --> 12:04.070
the red dye association,
and now, hopefully,

12:04.070 --> 12:06.590
we cut a trench,
and we can finally,

12:06.590 --> 12:09.960
once and for all, find
a box drain or a remnant of.

12:09.960 --> 12:13.590
-Uh, that’d be spectacular.
-CHARLES: I’d say.

12:13.590 --> 12:14.910
-See you later, Billy.
-See you guys.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.040
RICK:
Okeydoke.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.800
-(thunder rumbles)
-NARRATOR:

12:19.800 --> 12:20.940
Later that same day...

12:20.940 --> 12:27.340
...Jack Begley and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

12:27.340 --> 12:29.670
head to the island’s
western shore,

12:29.670 --> 12:32.670
to an area known as Lot 1.

12:32.670 --> 12:36.200
Now, where’d you want to go
around here, Gary?

12:36.200 --> 12:38.880
Well, if there’s a big boulder,
and there’s coins over there,

12:38.880 --> 12:41.260
there’s got to be coins
next to these big boulders.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.260
Let’s check it out.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.360
-After you.
-You got a shovel?

12:44.360 --> 12:47.190
NARRATOR:
Before the harsh winter comes,

12:47.190 --> 12:50.620
Jack and Gary are hoping
to find more artifacts

12:50.620 --> 12:52.350
similar to the gold brooch

12:52.350 --> 12:55.290
and decorative lead object
found earlier this year

12:55.290 --> 12:58.010
on the western side
of the island.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.720
To me, coming from a shipwreck,
treasure-hunting background,

13:01.720 --> 13:04.870
these large rocks
are great anchor points.

13:04.870 --> 13:08.190
Boats would come up, and
they’d moor up to these rocks.

13:08.190 --> 13:09.190
Oh!

13:09.190 --> 13:11.060
They would lose stuff,
coming to shore.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.930
It should be on the beach here.

13:12.930 --> 13:15.030
And then,
it gets caught on the rocks?

13:15.030 --> 13:17.890
Yup.
Uh, the rocks help trap stuff.

13:17.890 --> 13:19.090
(beeping)

13:22.490 --> 13:23.270
That sounds good.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.240
That’s a small iron target.

13:25.340 --> 13:26.530
I think
we’ll pass on that one, mate.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.490
Hang on a minute.

13:28.490 --> 13:31.850
-Is that pottery?
-Yeah.

13:31.850 --> 13:34.690
-That’s old pottery, as well.
-Oh!

13:34.690 --> 13:36.740
-GARY: Look at that. That’s...
-That’s the same type of blue

13:36.740 --> 13:38.570
that we’re finding
in the Money Pit.

13:38.570 --> 13:41.510
Exactly!
And we’re finding it here!

13:41.510 --> 13:44.730
We’re back in the 1700s, mate,
with this blue-glazed pottery.

13:44.730 --> 13:48.650
NARRATOR:
Pottery? From the 1700s?

13:48.650 --> 13:51.320
And similar to the pieces
that the team has also found

13:51.320 --> 13:54.220
deep underground
in the Money Pit.

13:54.220 --> 13:55.930
-Really good eye, Gary.
-You know what we should do?

13:55.930 --> 13:56.930
What?

13:56.930 --> 13:59.540
I think we should move some
of this stuff out of here.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.970
-Yeah.
-Do you want to pull it forward

14:00.970 --> 14:03.860
and-and winch this up
and get this out of here, mate?

14:03.860 --> 14:07.150
Sure, I’ll try to get it
as close as I can.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.810
JACK:
We’re finding pottery,

14:09.810 --> 14:13.720
and this piece was made
a long time ago.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.080
This pottery could actually be
treasure, because

14:18.080 --> 14:20.750
pottery this nice was

14:20.750 --> 14:23.500
of high value back in the day.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.690
It proves to me
we’re on the right path.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.480
-Here we go, Gary!
-All right, mate.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.600
Standing clear!

14:30.700 --> 14:31.700
(whirring)

14:37.700 --> 14:38.540
All right, that’ll do it!

14:38.640 --> 14:40.310
Nice one, Jack!

14:41.110 --> 14:43.450
-(beeping)
-Yup, I’m getting a signal!

14:44.050 --> 14:46.360
On my way, Gary!

14:46.360 --> 14:47.410
GARY:
It’s nonferrous,

14:47.410 --> 14:48.720
two-way, repeatable.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.280
-(detector whining)
-Just there, mate.

14:51.380 --> 14:53.980
GARY:
That is sweet.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.940
All right, get in here.

14:54.940 --> 14:57.160
-(beeping)
-JACK: Oh, it’s out already.

14:57.260 --> 14:57.960
-Yeah, it’s...

14:57.960 --> 15:00.470
All right, let’s see
what this metal is.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.860
I thought I was on it.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.160
(beeping)

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
(beeping continues)

15:13.360 --> 15:14.360
(beeping)

15:15.260 --> 15:16.260
-I see it!
-Hey!

15:16.260 --> 15:17.260
Is that a coin?

15:18.360 --> 15:19.360
JACK:
Is it?

15:19.360 --> 15:20.860
-GARY: Aah! It’s a button.
-Button. Button.

15:20.860 --> 15:22.360
What type of button
do you think it is?

15:22.360 --> 15:26.660
That is typical
1700s cuff button.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.260
-Right on the wrist?
-That would have been

15:28.260 --> 15:29.260
on a shirt cuff. Yeah.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.960
Do you think a modern
civilian would wear that,

15:31.960 --> 15:33.270
-or is it more military?
-Yeah.

15:33.570 --> 15:34.850
This is more military.

15:34.850 --> 15:38.850
Do you see that color, mate?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.870
It looks like
there could be writing there.

15:40.870 --> 15:44.050
Yeah. I was seeing gold gilding
on there.

15:44.050 --> 15:45.050
(Jack gasps)

15:45.050 --> 15:48.480
Yeah, that’s 1700s
all over it, mate.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.800
This is gold gilding,
by the look of this.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.970
Oh, yeah!
That looks just like the button

15:53.970 --> 15:55.640
-we found in the Money Pit.
-Yeah.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.460
It says plated. It’s a button.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.990
NARRATOR:
Two years ago, while searching

16:00.990 --> 16:02.529
through the spoils excavated

16:02.529 --> 16:04.180
from the borehole known
as GAL-1...

16:04.180 --> 16:05.780
CHARLES:
That’s got some marks

16:05.780 --> 16:07.340
on the side of it.

16:07.340 --> 16:08.770
NARRATOR:
...Rick, Marty, Charles

16:08.770 --> 16:10.250
and Gary were astonished

16:10.250 --> 16:11.990
to discover a gold-plated

16:11.990 --> 16:15.730
18th century
British military button.

16:15.730 --> 16:17.650
Could these two artifacts,

16:17.650 --> 16:20.890
found on opposite ends
of the island, be connected?

16:20.890 --> 16:23.350
If so, might they have been
left behind

16:23.350 --> 16:26.810
by someone searching
for something of great value?

16:26.810 --> 16:30.090
Or by someone depositing
something for safekeeping?

16:30.090 --> 16:33.520
Ah, I don’t want to rub it
too much in case I mess it up...

16:33.520 --> 16:35.660
And probably,
this side was all gilded,

16:35.660 --> 16:36.860
back in the day, as well.

16:36.860 --> 16:39.730
So, this would have been
like a fancy officer’s button,

16:39.730 --> 16:43.210
because only they would’ve had
the nice, gold buttons.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.770
-That’s nice.
-It means that we’re gonna have

16:45.770 --> 16:47.790
to search a lot more

16:47.790 --> 16:50.250
-on the western side.
-Yup.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.060
I’m thinking we come back

16:52.060 --> 16:54.340
when we’ve got more tide
to play with,

16:54.340 --> 16:56.920
because the tide’s
coming in, look.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.410
-Sounds good.
-All right, mate, let’s go.

17:03.410 --> 17:05.569
NARRATOR:
As a new day begins

17:05.569 --> 17:07.400
on Oak Island...
The Knights Baronet

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
had certainly enough time

17:08.400 --> 17:09.569
-Welcome to Oak Island.
-Thank you.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.059
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina and members

17:11.059 --> 17:12.540
of the team welcome

17:12.540 --> 17:14.660
an important visitor
to the war room.

17:14.660 --> 17:20.199
Guys, I just want to introduce
James McQuiston to you.

17:20.199 --> 17:22.689
perhaps, the Oak Island mystery.

17:22.689 --> 17:25.030
-Right here, sir.
-Right here? All right.

17:25.030 --> 17:27.609
NARRATOR:
As an author and researcher,

17:27.609 --> 17:29.730
James McQuiston specializes

17:29.730 --> 17:32.230
in stories that connect
descendants of the legendary

17:32.230 --> 17:34.800
Knights Templar
to their possible history

17:34.800 --> 17:36.510
in North America.

17:36.510 --> 17:39.590
Although he does not have
a particular theory as to

17:39.590 --> 17:42.090
where the Oak Island treasure
might be buried,

17:42.090 --> 17:45.050
his research has convinced him
that not only

17:45.050 --> 17:47.980
did members of the Knights
Templar come to Oak Island

17:47.980 --> 17:50.500
as far back
as the 14th century,

17:50.500 --> 17:53.440
but that they
and their descendants

17:53.440 --> 17:56.680
continued to come
and deposit treasure here

17:56.680 --> 18:00.310
during the course
of the next 400 years.

18:00.310 --> 18:03.340
RICK:
James McQuiston is a fellow

18:03.340 --> 18:05.940
of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.460
Well versed in Scottish lore,

18:07.460 --> 18:09.970
the history
of the Scottish clans.

18:09.970 --> 18:13.160
His theory revolves
around that central core issue.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.110
To that extent, James,
I’m gonna turn it over to you.

18:15.110 --> 18:18.910
I’ll be honest, upfront,
what I’ve learned of it,

18:18.910 --> 18:21.530
I find it incredibly interesting
and intriguing,

18:21.530 --> 18:23.350
and I think
we all very much look forward

18:23.350 --> 18:25.430
to what you have to tell us.

18:25.430 --> 18:27.860
Well, thanks for having me,
and, um,

18:27.860 --> 18:31.440
I’m gonna tell you a story
today, but you won’t

18:31.440 --> 18:33.809
find it written anywhere else,
because I found it

18:33.809 --> 18:36.050
piece by piece, just like you
folks are finding things

18:36.050 --> 18:38.800
piece by piece on this island.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.900
So, I want to start out
with the story

18:40.900 --> 18:43.760
of the Knights Baronet
of Nova Scotia.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.470
And how they came about
was actually because

18:46.470 --> 18:47.920
King James I of England,

18:47.920 --> 18:51.540
who also happened
to be King James VI of Scotland,

18:51.540 --> 18:54.950
wanted to oust the French
Catholics living at Port Royal.

18:54.950 --> 18:57.920
So, he went to his good friend
Sir William Alexander,

18:57.920 --> 19:00.900
who was on the Privy Council,
and he held various positions

19:00.900 --> 19:02.370
in government, and he said,

19:02.370 --> 19:05.360
"Can you get some of our fellow
Scotsman to go over there?"

19:05.360 --> 19:07.230
And he said, "Well,
you’ve got a New England,

19:07.230 --> 19:09.410
"you got a New France,
and you got a New Spain.

19:09.410 --> 19:12.180
If you give me a New Scotland,
I’ll do it."

19:12.180 --> 19:14.890
So, a new knighthood
was developed.

19:14.890 --> 19:17.260
It’s called
the Knights Baronet.

19:17.260 --> 19:18.690
The idea was, they would sell

19:18.690 --> 19:23.250
these knighthoods to, uh,
particularly clan chieftains,

19:23.250 --> 19:25.390
and they wrote the charter
in Latin,

19:25.390 --> 19:29.510
so "New Scotland" came out
as "Nova Scotia."

19:29.510 --> 19:32.290
NARRATOR:
Formed in 1625,

19:32.290 --> 19:36.180
the Knights Baronet of Nova
Scotia was a hereditary title

19:36.180 --> 19:39.050
that was conferred upon
a nobleman and his descendants

19:39.050 --> 19:40.250
in exchange for a fee.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.920
The objective was twofold.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.150
The first was to persuade
Scottish clan chiefs

19:46.150 --> 19:47.830
to leave their homes,

19:47.830 --> 19:49.300
make the treacherous
voyage west

19:49.300 --> 19:51.660
across the Atlantic Ocean,

19:51.660 --> 19:55.280
and then colonize this portion
of the New World.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.360
The second was
to raise money for the crown,

19:58.360 --> 20:01.809
as each knighthood was sold
for 3,000 marks,

20:01.809 --> 20:06.220
equivalent to 50,000
American dollars today.

20:06.220 --> 20:09.630
JAMES:
Sir William Alexander wanted

20:09.630 --> 20:11.050
to sell about 100 of these

20:11.050 --> 20:13.150
to create 100 towns
around Nova Scotia.

20:13.150 --> 20:15.370
That was the ultimate plan.

20:15.370 --> 20:19.580
And if you look at the overall
list of the Knights Baronet,

20:19.580 --> 20:22.350
25% of them had
some kind of connection

20:22.350 --> 20:25.550
back to the Knights Templar.

20:25.550 --> 20:28.510
But if you look
at just the first few dozen,

20:28.510 --> 20:31.809
they were all connected
to the Knights Templar.

20:31.809 --> 20:32.809
It was either

20:32.809 --> 20:36.260
they received land grants
of Knight Templar land,

20:36.260 --> 20:38.810
they had a Knights Templar
within their clan,

20:38.810 --> 20:41.830
or they fought along
Knights Templar in battles.

20:41.830 --> 20:44.410
They may have had Templar wealth
in their families,

20:44.410 --> 20:46.450
because when they were,
uh, dissolved,

20:46.450 --> 20:48.340
where’s all that stuff gonna go?

20:48.340 --> 20:50.500
It-It’s a continuous legacy

20:50.500 --> 20:52.680
from the Templars
to the Baronets,

20:52.680 --> 20:54.330
and there’s no doubt about it.

20:54.330 --> 20:56.870
So, from 1625,

20:56.870 --> 20:59.929
when the Baronets were founded,
to 1628,

20:59.929 --> 21:01.790
they worked to get enough men

21:01.790 --> 21:04.960
to sign up to get the manpower
and the supplies

21:04.960 --> 21:06.540
and the money that they needed

21:06.540 --> 21:08.870
to come to Nova Scotia.

21:08.870 --> 21:09.870
Once they got here,

21:09.870 --> 21:13.790
one of the places
I think they went was New Ross.

21:13.790 --> 21:17.510
NARRATOR:
Two years ago,

21:17.510 --> 21:20.760
Rick Lagina, Doug Crowell
and Charles Barkhouse

21:20.760 --> 21:23.490
traveled
to the town of New Ross,

21:23.490 --> 21:26.150
located some 20 miles north
of Oak Island.

21:26.150 --> 21:29.080
They had been invited
to investigate a property

21:29.080 --> 21:31.380
that many believe
contains evidence

21:31.380 --> 21:33.090
of an ancient Templar castle

21:33.090 --> 21:36.920
that was built sometime
in the 14th century.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.220
On the face of this stone,
you can see a very faint outline

21:40.220 --> 21:41.410
of a cross.

21:41.410 --> 21:45.700
It’s no ordinary cross, but the
cross of the Knights Templar.

21:45.700 --> 21:49.330
JAMES:
So, the Knights Baronet

21:49.330 --> 21:51.760
are connected
to the Knights Templar,

21:51.760 --> 21:54.470
and that connection goes
right through Nova Scotia.

21:54.470 --> 21:59.610
And it might be responsible for
a treasure buried on Oak Island.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.800
And there’s no known location

22:02.800 --> 22:03.972
for where this treasure
ended up.

22:03.972 --> 22:08.320
And I asked the
Society of Antiquaries,

22:08.320 --> 22:12.070
of which I am a member,
and they, uh, had no answer

22:12.070 --> 22:15.920
so they sent me to the
National Museums of Scotland

22:15.920 --> 22:18.220
and they had no answer
of what happened to it.

22:18.220 --> 22:21.510
Well, I found the treasure
listed in five ancient books

22:21.510 --> 22:25.270
and I have an account
of it here.

22:25.270 --> 22:27.750
It could literally be
a half a billion dollars.

22:27.750 --> 22:31.390
-Now we’re talking.
-(laughter)

22:37.535 --> 22:39.035
The Knights Baronet

22:39.160 --> 22:40.590
by the original depositors, re

22:40.590 --> 22:42.079
for a treasure buried
on Oak Island.

22:42.679 --> 22:44.000
NARRATOR:
In the war room,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.490
author and Oak Island theorist
James McQuiston

22:47.490 --> 22:49.220
has just presented Rick Lagina

22:49.220 --> 22:52.610
and members of the team
with an incredible theory.

22:52.610 --> 22:54.580
According to his research,

22:54.580 --> 22:58.080
in the early part
of the 17th century,

22:58.080 --> 23:00.320
Scottish descendants
of the Knights Templar,

23:00.320 --> 23:01.990
along with their associates,

23:01.990 --> 23:03.420
obtained titles of nobility

23:03.420 --> 23:05.200
from the British government,

23:05.200 --> 23:07.040
which issued them
as an incentive

23:07.040 --> 23:10.070
to come to Nova Scotia
and extend the reach

23:10.070 --> 23:12.570
of the British Empire.

23:12.570 --> 23:14.230
Over the next several decades,

23:14.230 --> 23:17.300
they built cities,
and established themselves

23:17.300 --> 23:20.010
in everything
from local governments

23:20.010 --> 23:22.429
to banking and overseas trade.

23:22.429 --> 23:26.220
But what the plan also did
was further establish

23:26.220 --> 23:28.800
a Templar stronghold
in North America,

23:28.800 --> 23:33.190
one that began as far back
as the 14th century,

23:33.190 --> 23:36.340
and which used Oak Island
as a repository

23:36.340 --> 23:39.330
for millions in gold, jewels,

23:39.330 --> 23:42.660
and precious artifacts
brought over from Europe.

23:42.660 --> 23:46.870
So, uh, the bottom line
is that it’s more than apparent

23:46.870 --> 23:49.910
that the-the Scottish
clan leaders,

23:49.910 --> 23:52.620
who became the Knights Baronet
of Nova Scotia,

23:52.620 --> 23:56.130
had a lot of links back
to the Knights Templar.

23:56.130 --> 24:00.410
And they stayed on Oak Island?

24:00.410 --> 24:02.440
If, in fact,
they came into Mahone Bay

24:02.440 --> 24:04.360
and parked at Oak Island,

24:04.360 --> 24:07.450
certainly enough time
to build the Money Pit.

24:07.450 --> 24:08.890
Time enough to put away things

24:08.890 --> 24:12.090
that they did not want
to take back to Scotland.

24:12.090 --> 24:13.549
Exactly.

24:13.549 --> 24:15.970
NARRATOR:
Although the notion

24:15.970 --> 24:18.320
that surviving members
of the Knights Templar

24:18.320 --> 24:21.880
made their way to North America
as early as the 14th century

24:21.880 --> 24:25.429
has been long debated
by mainstream historians,

24:25.429 --> 24:27.420
many Oak Island theorists
and researchers

24:27.420 --> 24:31.410
have become convinced
that numerous stone carvings

24:31.410 --> 24:33.500
and recently discovered
artifacts

24:33.500 --> 24:35.920
like the lead cross found
at Smith’s Cove

24:35.920 --> 24:40.910
have added further evidence
to support this theory.

24:40.910 --> 24:43.250
And again, just to revisit it
for a minute.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.360
This book that I found this in,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.220
this is the actual book
right here.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.971
The cover of the book and that’s
the title sheet of it.

24:49.971 --> 24:52.059
It’s the History
of the Lodge of Edinburgh,

24:52.059 --> 24:55.490
Mary’s Chapel, they call it,
Number One.

24:55.490 --> 24:58.220
This is the account
of the treasure.

24:58.220 --> 25:01.980
You have items on here like, uh,
36 dozen gold buttons,

25:01.980 --> 25:04.650
uh, "rich jewel set
of diamonds,"

25:04.650 --> 25:08.010
another, "gold bracelets
at 600 pounds the pair."

25:08.010 --> 25:10.310
GARY:
We found stuff off that list,

25:10.310 --> 25:11.810
what you’ve just read off.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.000
The gold-plated button.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.600
We found jewelry,
and previously,

25:16.600 --> 25:19.720
there’s been gold chain links
found on the island.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.940
The other item
of great interest on this,

25:22.940 --> 25:25.910
is that
the very last item listed,

25:25.910 --> 25:28.750
it says,

25:28.750 --> 25:31.100
in till or there in."

25:31.100 --> 25:35.450
Back then, title deeds were kept
in canvas waxed bags,

25:35.450 --> 25:37.060
to protect the India ink.

25:37.060 --> 25:40.310
So, uh, as you know, in 1897,

25:40.310 --> 25:42.390
a little piece
of parchment was pulled up

25:42.390 --> 25:45.880
from, uh, the Money Pit
at about 150 feet down.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.620
Here it is, and guess what?

25:47.620 --> 25:50.082
No smearing of the India ink.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.380
So what that would tell me

25:51.380 --> 25:53.679
is that this was kept in
something that was waterproof

25:53.679 --> 25:56.620
until that drill bit hit it and
brought it up to the surface.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.429
NARRATOR:
While drilling in the Money Pit

25:58.429 --> 26:01.059
area in 1897,

26:01.059 --> 26:02.570
treasure hunters
William Chappell

26:02.570 --> 26:05.850
and Frederick Blair reported
hitting an object

26:05.850 --> 26:08.780
they believed to be a
seven-foot-tall wooden vault

26:08.780 --> 26:12.679
at a depth of 153 feet.

26:12.679 --> 26:14.900
When examining the drill bit,
shortly thereafter,

26:14.900 --> 26:18.640
they were astonished
to discover traces of gold

26:18.640 --> 26:20.780
along with a tiny piece
of parchment

26:20.780 --> 26:24.240
bearing the letters V-I.

26:24.240 --> 26:28.059
Just one year ago, after a
50-inch-wide steel caisson

26:28.059 --> 26:31.100
made contact with what
the Oak Island team believes

26:31.100 --> 26:34.850
could be the Chappell Vault
in the borehole known as H-8,

26:34.850 --> 26:39.190
Jack Begley and Dan Henskee
made a similar discovery

26:39.190 --> 26:42.190
while searching the spoils
excavated from the shaft.

26:42.190 --> 26:45.090
It kind of looks like it could
be some old parchment.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.780
NARRATOR:
Could this parchment,

26:46.780 --> 26:48.000
along with fragments

26:48.000 --> 26:50.429
of leather bookbinding
and antique paper

26:50.429 --> 26:52.440
also recovered from H-8,

26:52.440 --> 26:55.720
be proof that James McQuiston’s
theory is true?

26:55.720 --> 26:58.370
That important books
and manuscripts were also

26:58.370 --> 27:00.230
a part of the Oak Island
treasure.

27:00.230 --> 27:04.020
And that the treasure wasn’t
brought here all at once,

27:04.020 --> 27:07.809
but gradually, and over the
course of several centuries.

27:07.809 --> 27:11.460
So, uh,
I’m going out on a limb here,

27:11.460 --> 27:15.190
but I believe that at least some
of this massive treasure

27:15.190 --> 27:18.059
was brought to the New World,

27:18.059 --> 27:19.640
possibly by
the Alexander family,

27:19.640 --> 27:22.679
and, uh, was buried here
on Oak Island.

27:22.679 --> 27:25.429
And, so I-I kind of feel,
myself,

27:25.429 --> 27:28.370
that this presents
one of the best, uh, answers

27:28.370 --> 27:31.280
to what happened on Oak Island
and at New Ross.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.090
RICK:
You know, theorists

27:33.090 --> 27:34.260
have come and gone here.

27:34.260 --> 27:38.960
What separates the real theories
as it applies to real search,

27:38.960 --> 27:41.910
generally, those theories
have to connect the dots.

27:41.910 --> 27:46.580
James has come, he connects
one fact with another fact.

27:46.580 --> 27:51.180
Now, some of them are an
interpretation of known facts,

27:51.180 --> 27:53.470
but-but the dots
are pretty close together,

27:53.470 --> 27:55.230
and I, and I am thoroughly
impressed.

27:55.230 --> 27:58.630
I know one thing that you
reinforced to me, surely,

27:58.630 --> 28:02.060
is that the richness
of Oak Island

28:02.060 --> 28:04.100
really centers around the story.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.720
The who, what, when, where,
why and how,

28:07.720 --> 28:10.460
and you have answered several
of those.

28:10.460 --> 28:13.340
You have a very strong theory
with a-a treasure

28:13.340 --> 28:16.400
that seems to match some
of the discoveries here.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.130
And backing it up with facts
and research.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.150
-It’s-it’s amazing.
-Yeah.

28:20.150 --> 28:22.770
I find it incredibly interesting
and intriguing,

28:22.770 --> 28:25.430
and I congratulate you on
the extent of your research.

28:25.430 --> 28:28.680
Well, I hope to someday come
back with even some more stuff.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.090
We will not allow you
to stay away.

28:31.090 --> 28:32.110
-I guarantee you that.
-Mm-hmm.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.049
Again, thank you very much.
I think we all express that.

28:35.049 --> 28:38.000
-CRAIG: Absolutely.
-JAMES: Thank you, guys.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.510
NARRATOR:
The next day,

28:40.510 --> 28:43.640
Marty Lagina and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

28:43.640 --> 28:47.679
arrive at Lot 16, located near
the Money Pit dig site.

28:47.679 --> 28:50.410
Yeah, what we’re doing,
we’re going to where

28:50.410 --> 28:52.860
-they found... Yeah, the well.
-MARTY: That well is.

28:52.860 --> 28:53.920
NARRATOR:
After their meeting with

28:53.920 --> 28:55.610
theorist James McQuiston,

28:55.610 --> 28:59.130
they are eager to follow up
on possible new connections

28:59.130 --> 29:02.120
linking the Knights of Baronet
to Oak Island,

29:02.120 --> 29:05.290
by investigating a recently
discovered stone well

29:05.290 --> 29:08.559
located near the Money Pit.

29:08.559 --> 29:10.299
After close examination,

29:10.299 --> 29:12.120
it was found
to bear several design

29:12.120 --> 29:14.220
and construction similarities

29:14.220 --> 29:16.850
to one the team investigated
two years ago

29:16.850 --> 29:19.960
near the ruins of an alleged
Templar castle located

29:19.960 --> 29:21.960
in the nearby town of New Ross.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.730
RICK:
That look like flagstone floor?

29:24.730 --> 29:27.000
NARRATOR:
There, inside the well,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.100
they observed a triangle,

29:29.100 --> 29:31.549
or pyramid, carved into one
of the stones.

29:31.549 --> 29:32.549
TONY:
It’s got some little pattern

29:32.549 --> 29:33.549
in the middle.

29:33.549 --> 29:35.130
NARRATOR:
It is this same shape

29:35.130 --> 29:37.600
which has frequently
appeared on Oak Island,

29:37.600 --> 29:40.520
not only in various carvings,
such as those found

29:40.520 --> 29:43.010
on the legendary 90 Foot Stone,

29:43.010 --> 29:46.240
but also the shape
of the mysterious swamp,

29:46.240 --> 29:50.059
which many believe
to be man-made.

29:50.059 --> 29:52.860
I think this well
is really, really old.

29:52.860 --> 29:54.650
This looks like a modern cap,

29:54.650 --> 29:56.710
but when you look inside there,
see all the formation?

29:56.710 --> 29:58.460
MARTY:
Now I see, yeah.

29:58.460 --> 29:59.990
Yeah, I had never noticed

29:59.990 --> 30:01.669
-that the top looks different...
-Yeah, well...

30:01.669 --> 30:04.730
...than the underneath,
that’s very true.

30:04.730 --> 30:06.490
-Nobody seems to know
anything about it.

30:06.490 --> 30:07.560
-I agree.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.710
The curiosity about that thing
is who built it and when?

30:10.710 --> 30:13.590
It would be good to take
that cap off that well.

30:13.590 --> 30:15.830
You know what, Gary,
I like your idea so much

30:15.830 --> 30:17.440
about removing the cap
of that well.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.720
I am going
to call Mr. Laird Niven

30:19.720 --> 30:21.950
and see whether
we’re allowed to.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.100
NARRATOR:
In accordance with their

30:23.100 --> 30:25.250
treasure trove license,

30:25.250 --> 30:27.410
Marty and Gary must first
seek permission

30:27.410 --> 30:29.490
from archeologist Laird Niven

30:29.490 --> 30:31.600
before they can excavate
any site

30:31.600 --> 30:33.200
that could be deemed
historically

30:33.200 --> 30:34.400
or culturally significant.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.400
Laird!

30:35.400 --> 30:37.309
LAIRD (over phone):
Hey, Marty, how are you?

30:37.309 --> 30:39.820
MARTY:
Hey, Gary and I are out here

30:39.820 --> 30:41.400
just off the edge
of the Money Pit,

30:41.400 --> 30:42.820
and there’s a well here
which has

30:42.820 --> 30:44.840
-a modern top on it, you know?
-LAIRD: Yeah.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.410
Is it okay to pull the top off?

30:46.410 --> 30:49.110
-Or do you need to...
-That’s fine with me.

30:49.110 --> 30:51.510
-MARTY: Okay.
-I have no problem with that.

30:51.510 --> 30:53.300
MARTY:
All right, Laird. See ya.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.300
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.000
-We can.
-GARY: Yeah, that’s good news.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.100
MARTY:
I mean, it would have been--

30:58.100 --> 31:00.010
If it is old with a modern cap,

31:00.010 --> 31:02.360
it could’ve been here
when the Money Pit was here.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.360
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.679
Yeah, this is a big undertaking,
the Money Pit.

31:05.679 --> 31:07.850
You would need fresh water,
you’d need to have

31:07.850 --> 31:10.690
a freshwater well close
to the Money Pit.

31:10.690 --> 31:11.690
This might be original.

31:11.690 --> 31:14.730
All right.
Well, let’s go do that.

31:14.730 --> 31:15.730
(beeping)

31:15.730 --> 31:18.210
MARTY:
With a little bit of luck,

31:18.210 --> 31:19.460
this may lead us to perhaps

31:19.460 --> 31:20.860
figure out what happened here,

31:20.860 --> 31:24.260
at least in one point
in history.

31:24.260 --> 31:28.320
GARY:
I’ll guide him down.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.390
A little bit this way.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.010
That’s better.

31:34.010 --> 31:37.780
You got it!

31:37.780 --> 31:41.740
NARRATOR:
Now that the cap on the well

31:41.740 --> 31:43.320
has been removed,

31:43.320 --> 31:46.710
Gary will now scan the inside
of it using a metal detector

31:46.710 --> 31:51.169
in search of any important
clues or possible artifacts.

31:51.169 --> 31:53.669
(detector beeping)

31:53.669 --> 31:56.179
Hmm. Metal.

31:56.179 --> 31:57.440
Hey.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.230
That was a job well done, Marty.

31:59.230 --> 32:00.980
-It really was.
-Thank you. Thank you.

32:00.980 --> 32:03.370
And I’ve had
a little explore around.

32:03.370 --> 32:05.380
I didn’t get any metal
until I put

32:05.380 --> 32:07.480
the search coil inside the well.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.190
-Oh, and then you got some?
-Yeah.

32:09.190 --> 32:10.190
(detector beeps)

32:10.190 --> 32:12.080
MARTY:
Oh, my goodness.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.510
-That’s a good sound,
too, isn’t it?

32:13.510 --> 32:14.510
-Yeah, it is.

32:14.510 --> 32:16.280
That’s a good solid hit.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.310
How are we gonna dig it out
of there, though?

32:18.310 --> 32:21.360
Yeah, that’s the thing. It’s a
pity we can’t drain the water.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.380
Does this--
does this look old to you?

32:23.380 --> 32:24.970
-Um, yeah, it does.
-I’m sure we can

32:24.970 --> 32:26.760
put a pump in there
and get rid of that.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.270
NARRATOR:
Although Marty and Gary

32:28.270 --> 32:29.270
are encouraged

32:29.270 --> 32:31.440
by the promising hits
Gary has obtained

32:31.440 --> 32:32.970
with his metal detector,

32:32.970 --> 32:35.780
they will need to allow
for a pump to drain the well

32:35.780 --> 32:37.870
over the course
of the next 24 hours

32:37.870 --> 32:39.980
before they can further
their investigation

32:39.980 --> 32:41.960
of whatever
might be buried there.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.740
Well, this is cool.
I mean, I love...

32:44.740 --> 32:46.200
I love unearthing
a new possibility.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.210
-Yep.
-I mean, what if this--

32:47.210 --> 32:48.210
yeah, what if this was done

32:48.210 --> 32:50.250
by the original depositors?

32:50.250 --> 32:51.360
Later on, somebody came

32:51.360 --> 32:52.669
-and put a cap on it.
-Yeah.

32:52.669 --> 32:54.610
And you find something in there.

32:54.610 --> 32:55.620
-All right,
mate, but this is great.

32:55.620 --> 32:56.320
-No, I...

32:56.320 --> 32:57.200
-You had a great...
we got some signals

32:57.200 --> 32:57.930
to come back to.

32:57.930 --> 32:59.770
Okay. Let’s go, Gary.

33:06.070 --> 33:07.730
NARRATOR:
As a new day dawns

33:07.730 --> 33:08.950
on Oak Island...
GARY:

33:08.950 --> 33:09.950
It’s a... Oh, it is a...

33:09.950 --> 33:10.950
MARTY:
Now it’s pumping.

33:10.950 --> 33:11.950
NARRATOR:
...Marty Lagina

33:11.950 --> 33:14.380
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton...

33:14.380 --> 33:16.740
...are continuing
their investigation

33:16.740 --> 33:20.200
of an old stone well on Lot 16

33:20.200 --> 33:21.510
located near
the Money Pit area,

33:21.510 --> 33:25.039
a structure they hope
might provide new clues

33:25.039 --> 33:27.630
to help them solve
the 223-year-old mystery.

33:27.630 --> 33:32.320
-Now we’re draining.
-Here you go, bud.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.320
Thanks.

33:33.320 --> 33:38.730
All right, I think I’m ready
to get back in there.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.150
All right.

33:40.150 --> 33:41.870
NARRATOR:
Having successfully drained

33:41.870 --> 33:44.450
the water
from the bottom of the well,

33:44.450 --> 33:47.370
Marty and Gary are eager to dig
for the metal targets

33:47.370 --> 33:49.799
that Gary detected one day ago

33:49.799 --> 33:51.780
in the hopes
one or more of them

33:51.780 --> 33:53.200
might be important clues

33:53.200 --> 33:56.440
or, hopefully,
pieces of treasure.

33:56.440 --> 34:02.200
Ah, what a sweet
little place this is.

34:02.200 --> 34:06.690
It would be nice to find

34:06.690 --> 34:12.179
another stone
with an inscription on it.

34:12.179 --> 34:13.889
Unusual shape.

34:13.889 --> 34:19.870
MARTY:
All right, we’ll put this one

34:19.870 --> 34:23.290
off to the side.

34:23.290 --> 34:28.730
GARY:
I’m trying to feel for things.

34:33.330 --> 34:35.500
You want to try
your metal detector on it?

34:35.500 --> 34:36.510
Yeah.

34:43.909 --> 34:46.219
-(detector beeping)
-I’ll put it in "well" mode.

34:46.219 --> 34:48.070
-Yeah.
-(Gary laughs)

34:48.570 --> 34:51.199
All right, let’s see.

34:53.599 --> 34:55.359
(beeping continues)

34:55.359 --> 34:57.690
It’s iron. Whatever it is,

34:57.690 --> 34:59.200
-it’s iron.
-That’s too bad.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.820
But I’m getting
multiple signals now on this.

35:02.820 --> 35:04.660
Ferrous and nonferrous,

35:04.660 --> 35:09.840
so there could be
different metals in here.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.260
NARRATOR:
A nonferrous signal?

35:11.260 --> 35:13.790
Indicating the presence
of a precious metal,

35:13.790 --> 35:16.200
such as silver or even gold?

35:16.200 --> 35:18.470
I’m-I’m gonna try and pinpoint.
It’s easier.

35:23.270 --> 35:25.180
All right, here we go.

35:26.680 --> 35:30.599
Please don’t be a nail.

35:30.599 --> 35:32.230
No, it is a piece... Ooh!

35:32.230 --> 35:35.810
It’s a piece of decorated lead,
by the look of it.

35:35.810 --> 35:36.510
Really?

35:37.310 --> 35:39.060
Put it in your hands.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.200
There’s two pieces coming up.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.720
-Got them?
-Yep.

35:48.120 --> 35:49.650
Oh! It’s a...

35:49.650 --> 35:52.219
-(laughs) What do you got?
-I don’t know yet,

35:52.219 --> 35:53.550
but it looks shiny!

35:53.650 --> 35:54.650
Oh!

35:54.650 --> 35:55.680
It’s a... Oh!

35:55.680 --> 35:56.700
It’s a...

36:03.200 --> 36:04.250
I got a coin!

36:04.250 --> 36:06.150
-Do you?
-Yeah, it’s a coin!

36:06.150 --> 36:08.200
Don’t tell me
you’re gonna do your gold dance

36:08.200 --> 36:09.640
down in the well.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.020
It’s a one dollar.

36:12.020 --> 36:13.020
Canadian dollar.

36:13.020 --> 36:15.380
-Can you believe it?
-You bugger.

36:15.380 --> 36:16.750
Oh, my God.

36:17.150 --> 36:18.150
Bugger all.

36:19.450 --> 36:21.100
I thought that was a gold coin.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.880
I’m thinking to myself,
How am I gonna dance in here?

36:22.880 --> 36:25.380
-You would do it.
-I would do it, yeah.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.099
I’m gonna see
if there’s any more of that,

36:27.099 --> 36:28.180
but that looks like it’s a piece

36:28.180 --> 36:29.280
of decorated lead.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.410
You can see there was some kind
of design on it.

36:32.410 --> 36:36.600
NARRATOR:
A piece of decorated lead?

36:36.600 --> 36:37.600
Could it be related

36:37.600 --> 36:39.480
to the other lead artifacts
the team has found

36:39.480 --> 36:43.349
on Lot 21 on the western end
of Oak Island

36:43.349 --> 36:44.940
and at Smith’s Cove,

36:44.940 --> 36:48.210
both of which may be connected
to the Knights Templar?

36:48.210 --> 36:51.070
MARTY:
Well, I’ll get that cleaned up

36:51.070 --> 36:53.309
-in a little bit.
-GARY: Yeah.

36:53.309 --> 36:56.240
I am getting soaked.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.990
MARTY:
Hey, Rick. Morning, bud.

37:02.990 --> 37:04.360
Gary just found
this piece of lead.

37:04.460 --> 37:05.760
RICK:
Interesting.

37:07.860 --> 37:08.560
GARY:
Ah!

37:09.560 --> 37:10.560
Detecting anything, Gary?

37:10.960 --> 37:11.960
GARY:
Definitely.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.090
There’s more metal down here.

37:13.090 --> 37:16.660
But I just can’t work
’cause the water pouring on me,

37:16.660 --> 37:17.660
-and it’s...
-I wonder how

37:17.660 --> 37:18.660
we’re gonna stop that, though.

37:18.660 --> 37:19.720
GARY:
It’s filling up fast.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.790
All right, mate, I’m coming out.

37:22.790 --> 37:23.900
NARRATOR:
Although the well

37:23.900 --> 37:25.480
was previously pumped dry,

37:25.480 --> 37:29.050
due to the fact that it is fed
by a natural spring,

37:29.050 --> 37:33.570
it has already begun to refill
with groundwater.

37:33.570 --> 37:36.119
Because of this,
Rick, Marty and Gary

37:36.119 --> 37:38.660
have decided to stop
their investigation for now

37:38.660 --> 37:41.200
in order to devise
a new strategy

37:41.200 --> 37:44.369
that will allow them to conduct
a more thorough search.

37:44.369 --> 37:48.170
I mean,
this is a unique opportunity,

37:48.170 --> 37:50.460
a well next to the Money Pit

37:50.460 --> 37:51.850
and being the first person

37:51.850 --> 37:54.930
to get whatever’s down
in that well out.

37:54.930 --> 37:58.060
-That’s pretty cool.
-Pretty cool.

37:58.060 --> 38:01.100
But save it
for another day, right?

38:01.100 --> 38:02.880
Yeah, for sure.
But I’m confident

38:02.880 --> 38:05.180
there’s got to be something
down there.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.660
All right, Gary.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.380
A job well done.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.900
NARRATOR:
Following the investigation

38:14.900 --> 38:18.470
of the old stone well
on Lot 16,

38:18.470 --> 38:21.740
Rick and Marty Lagina meet
with archaeologist Laird Niven

38:21.740 --> 38:23.720
at Smith’s Cove.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.840
They are eager to apply
a scientific dating method

38:26.840 --> 38:29.080
known as dendrochronology

38:29.080 --> 38:32.070
to find out the age of
the various wooden structures

38:32.070 --> 38:34.020
recently unearthed at the site.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.000
MARTY:
What do you want to do, Rick?

38:36.000 --> 38:38.100
You have cut it here,
and this is damaging.

38:38.100 --> 38:41.840
-You’ll lose growth rings here.
-MARTY: He’s right.

38:41.840 --> 38:42.940
LAIRD:
Yeah.

38:42.940 --> 38:44.040
NARRATOR:
Dendrochronology,

38:44.040 --> 38:45.580
or tree-ring dating,

38:45.580 --> 38:49.460
analyzes the size and pattern
of a tree’s growth rings,

38:49.460 --> 38:52.960
which develop over the course
of a tree’s lifetime.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.520
By using
this extraordinary method,

38:55.520 --> 38:57.550
not only
will the Oak Island team

38:57.550 --> 38:59.320
be able to find out
the age of the tree

38:59.320 --> 39:01.970
that was used
to produce the wood,

39:01.970 --> 39:03.320
it can also determine

39:03.320 --> 39:05.430
the approximate year
the wood was cut

39:05.430 --> 39:07.520
for construction purposes.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.570
The hope is that we can come
to an understanding

39:10.570 --> 39:12.910
of how these structures
might interrelate.

39:12.910 --> 39:15.670
The two walls,
the L-shaped structure,

39:15.670 --> 39:17.420
the U-shaped structure,
the slipway--

39:17.420 --> 39:19.609
dendrochronology may be a way

39:19.609 --> 39:21.370
to come
to a better understanding

39:21.370 --> 39:24.020
of the when of their construct.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.190
MARTY:
Wondering if Billy

39:25.190 --> 39:26.190
could track down

39:26.190 --> 39:27.190
to lift this.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.190
He can reach right out here,

39:29.190 --> 39:30.890
pick it up.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.430
-Okay.
-MARTY: I’ll go get him.

39:36.430 --> 39:38.020
NARRATOR:
This year,

39:38.020 --> 39:41.460
during their extensive
excavation at Smith’s Cove,

39:41.460 --> 39:43.210
the Oak Island team
has unearthed

39:43.210 --> 39:47.770
an astonishing number
of archaeological finds.

39:47.770 --> 39:51.010
In addition to the mysterious
"U" and L-shaped structures

39:51.010 --> 39:53.060
discovered earlier
by Dan Blankenship

39:53.060 --> 39:54.060
in the 1970s,

39:54.060 --> 39:59.070
they have also revealed
wooden and concrete walls,

39:59.070 --> 40:02.300
as well as the remains
of a slipway or boat ramp

40:02.300 --> 40:04.430
possibly constructed
to offload cargo

40:04.430 --> 40:07.460
from a ship
onto Oak Island centuries ago.

40:07.460 --> 40:10.410
MARTY:
Bring her up slow, Billy.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.050
NARRATOR:
If the Laginas

40:12.050 --> 40:13.050
and their partners...

40:13.050 --> 40:14.050
Oh!

40:14.050 --> 40:15.320
...can determine
that the structures

40:15.320 --> 40:17.500
found at Smith’s Cove
were constructed

40:17.500 --> 40:19.380
before the discovery
of the Money Pit

40:19.380 --> 40:21.070
in 1795,

40:21.070 --> 40:23.450
they may be on the verge

40:23.450 --> 40:25.710
of identifying once and for all

40:25.710 --> 40:27.830
not only when
the Money Pit was built,

40:27.830 --> 40:31.140
but also who built it and why.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.850
-That is amazingly preserved.
-Yeah.

40:33.850 --> 40:35.050
RICK:
Well, hopefully

40:35.050 --> 40:36.050
this dendrochronology

40:36.050 --> 40:39.680
-will yield some results.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.800
MARTY:
All right.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.630
Well, let’s keep going.

40:44.630 --> 40:48.540
There’s still plenty of work
to be done at Smith’s Cove,

40:48.540 --> 40:49.540
clearly.

40:49.540 --> 40:50.540
RICK:
We’re hopeful

40:50.540 --> 40:52.950
to put closure on this effort,

40:52.950 --> 40:56.260
but we are still quite confused

40:56.260 --> 40:58.560
by the amount of structures.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.680
What was the reason
for their emplacement?

41:00.680 --> 41:01.780
Let’s see if this one’s

41:01.780 --> 41:03.670
flat underneath, too.
You think it is, right?

41:03.670 --> 41:04.940
RICK:
There’s a lot of questions

41:04.940 --> 41:07.180
to be answered yet.

41:07.180 --> 41:09.839
NARRATOR
A week that began

41:09.839 --> 41:12.330
with a frustrating setback
at the Money Pit site

41:12.330 --> 41:15.040
has become one
of new directions

41:15.040 --> 41:17.090
and renewed excitement.

41:17.090 --> 41:22.090
For, as the Laginas and their
partners have long understood,

41:22.090 --> 41:24.589
on Oak Island, a breakdown

41:24.589 --> 41:26.500
can lead to a breakthrough;

41:26.500 --> 41:32.310
disappointment can lead
to discovery;

41:32.310 --> 41:34.320
and even a tragedy can lead

41:34.320 --> 41:35.370
to a possible triumph

41:35.370 --> 41:39.230
one that could result

41:39.230 --> 41:44.080
in the solving
of a 223-year-old mystery.

41:48.180 --> 41:50.580
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:50.580 --> 41:53.250
That star lays right on
the southeast corner

41:53.250 --> 41:55.120
-of that swamp.
-RICK: The back door.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.220
This leads to the Money Pit.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.520
Here it comes. Steady up.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.820
I think the swamp has answers,
and I want them.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.620
-It’s a coin!
Maybe there are answers

42:01.720 --> 42:02.320
in the swamp.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.070
-Oh, oh! Whoa, whoa!
it looks like a pile

42:04.070 --> 42:04.770
of boulders.

42:04.770 --> 42:05.970
-ALEX: See the water?
-TERRY: Substantial amount

42:05.970 --> 42:06.970
of water flowing out of it.

42:06.970 --> 42:08.510
-Maybe the flood tunnel?
-COLIN: The wood

42:08.510 --> 42:12.110
in the slipway matches
with the 550-year-old tree.

42:12.110 --> 42:14.080
-It is original.
-It predates the Money Pit.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.480
-Yes. -RICK: It’s conclusive proof.
