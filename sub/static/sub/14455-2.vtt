00:11.533 --> 00:12.667
Narrator: Coming up...

00:12.667 --> 00:14.567
Why is Murr getting whacked?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.133
What's got Q
being such a big mouth?

00:19.133 --> 00:20.900
Hey, hey, feed me!

00:22.167 --> 00:23.700
Narrator:
And which punished Joker

00:23.700 --> 00:26.200
will be humiliated
from sea to shining sea?

00:28.267 --> 00:31.100
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.167
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.500
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:37.300 --> 00:40.033
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:40.033 --> 00:42.067
Joe: Larry!

00:46.267 --> 00:48.733
Today, we're getting people's
opinions about New York City,

00:48.733 --> 00:51.100
but the real people
getting docked is us.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.367
While giving the survey,

00:52.367 --> 00:54.767
the other guys will be
behind that glass wall

00:54.767 --> 00:57.000
that becomes see-through
at the flip of a switch.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.100
The goal is not to laugh,

00:58.100 --> 00:59.367
but when that glass
becomes see-through --

00:59.367 --> 01:01.233
Whoo!
Good luck with that.

01:04.633 --> 01:07.967
**

01:07.967 --> 01:09.933
Sal: Right now, you have
a black T-shirt on

01:09.933 --> 01:12.067
with a sports jacket
and long hair and scruff.

01:12.067 --> 01:16.367
This is what middle-aged
hip looks like, man.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.533
I'd like to say
it looks good on you.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.200
Eh, you'd like to.
I'd like to.

01:20.367 --> 01:21.533
Murr: Here we go.

01:21.533 --> 01:22.633
Fellas.
You starting it off?

01:22.633 --> 01:23.833
I'm starting it off.
All right, Joe.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.067
Go give them hell.
All right.

01:25.067 --> 01:27.233
Name three pros and cons

01:27.233 --> 01:30.233
about living
in or near New York City.

01:30.233 --> 01:33.300
Um, the pros, you know,
entertainment all over.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.633
Murr: What is that?
What is that?

01:36.633 --> 01:41.567
Public transit,
you know, really...

01:41.567 --> 01:42.767
Where I live,
you kind of need a car,

01:42.767 --> 01:44.733
but it's not necessary.

01:44.733 --> 01:46.800
I mean, there are buses
and stuff, so...

01:46.800 --> 01:48.400
It's Joe
being born out of an egg.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.200
Um...

01:50.433 --> 01:52.633
I don't think
it's really too --

01:52.633 --> 01:54.267
And it's kind of dirty,
but nobody thinks it's --

01:57.600 --> 01:59.067
Something back there?
No, no.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.667
There's a damn fly that's
been going around all day.

02:01.667 --> 02:02.767
Okay, that's hysterical.

02:02.767 --> 02:04.467
We cracked up.
He did a hard smile.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.467
Really?
He just smiled.

02:05.467 --> 02:06.433
He didn't break.
Damn.

02:06.433 --> 02:09.200
Describe
your dream apartment.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.700
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go.

02:10.700 --> 02:12.967
Well, um, you can get anywhere
quickly by transit.

02:12.967 --> 02:13.967
**

02:16.233 --> 02:18.267
Murr: It's all of
Q's firemen buddies!

02:23.167 --> 02:24.633
Lots of space, you know?

02:24.633 --> 02:25.833
Joe: That's a laugh.

02:25.833 --> 02:27.233
Something like that.

02:27.233 --> 02:29.467
Q: Downtown,
they do a lot of that.

02:29.467 --> 02:32.233
There is some weird
going on in New York City.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.300
Got him!

02:33.300 --> 02:34.433
Describe Prospect Park.

02:34.433 --> 02:36.567
What I like about it most
is that,

02:36.567 --> 02:38.533
well, they have
the summer concert
in the summer.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.167
They have the, like,
bands that play there,

02:40.167 --> 02:42.767
so I've gone there
for that.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.667
Joe: This is our good friend
Bryan Johnson.

02:44.667 --> 02:46.267
He's from the TV show
"Comic Book Men."

02:46.267 --> 02:48.567
Sal: By the way,
he brought his own shorts.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.833
That's true.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.800
The, uh --
what's the --

02:52.800 --> 02:55.533
do you understand
the alternate is to laugh?

02:55.533 --> 02:56.400
Joe: Yeah!
Murr: Got you!

02:56.400 --> 02:57.467
Do you understand

02:57.467 --> 02:58.833
the alternate side of the street
parking rule

02:58.833 --> 03:00.867
at all in New York City?

03:00.867 --> 03:01.900
'Cause I don't.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.433
I don't know what's going on
sometimes.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.967
Joe: He's done!

03:05.967 --> 03:07.767
Hi, I'm James Murray.
Ramón.

03:07.767 --> 03:09.067
Ramón,
nice to meet you, sir.

03:09.067 --> 03:10.133
These are questions about

03:10.133 --> 03:11.667
your experience
being a New Yorker, okay?

03:11.667 --> 03:13.967
For this one, we need a prop
from Murray's jacket.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.900
What are
the primary reasons

03:15.900 --> 03:18.367
that you wouldn't
necessarily go to see
professional sports?

03:18.367 --> 03:21.300
When comes to sports,
professional sports,

03:21.300 --> 03:22.833
I'm not interested in it.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.600
Well,
I got to take that back.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.933
Sal:
That's your credit card.

03:25.933 --> 03:27.100
Well, that's gonna be
a good Tennis match,

03:27.100 --> 03:28.433
when the US Open
is going on.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.967
Oh, it got declined.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.233
Well, for sports,
I go to --

03:32.233 --> 03:34.633
Oh, that's your
second credit card.

03:34.633 --> 03:36.600
Okay, on Sundays,
I just go to the park.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.467
Okay, I enjoy that then.

03:39.467 --> 03:42.067
Okay, on Sundays
in the summer time.

03:42.067 --> 03:45.200
Uh, when it
comes to recreation --

03:45.200 --> 03:46.300
Come on!

03:46.300 --> 03:48.233
Sal: That's a laugh!
That's a laugh!

03:48.233 --> 03:49.533
When it
comes to recreation --

03:49.533 --> 03:51.400
Is somebody behind me?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.700
No, I'm thinking --
you know what it was?

03:52.700 --> 03:54.233
I was thinking --

03:54.233 --> 03:55.700
He's gonna wash this.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.967
I was gonna say --
Oh, that's gross.

03:57.967 --> 03:59.767
Where were you born?
Ramón: In Brooklyn.

03:59.767 --> 04:02.700
We used to play
on the trains.
Sure.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.300
Oh, it's a young Murr.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.133
They used to have
these locomotives there.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.800
It would be at the pizzeria
two blocks from the house.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.967
The pizzeria.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.633
Q: Oh, no,
what is happening, Murr?

04:13.633 --> 04:14.400
Come on.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.333
Then we'd go home,

04:16.333 --> 04:17.367
and then afterward,

04:17.367 --> 04:19.100
we'd come back,
get together,

04:19.100 --> 04:21.567
and we'd go to
the pizzeria.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.700
Q: Yeah, we got him.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.333
There's a great pizzeria
called Linseo's.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.667
We used to go there
every week.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.433
Hey, guys, have fun.

04:28.433 --> 04:29.667
In the past decade,

04:29.667 --> 04:32.700
take me through the best
New York day you've had.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.167
Well, it'd have to be
more than 10 years.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.900
Okay.
Sure, it can be any time.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.067
Some friends of mine
from L.A. came over.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.567
Mm-hmm.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.200
* This love
We spent the whole day
in the city,

04:42.200 --> 04:43.567
and we traveled --

04:43.567 --> 04:45.767
At that time, we traveled,
I showed them --

04:45.767 --> 04:47.333
You remember "Ghost,"
right, Murr?

04:47.333 --> 04:49.333
I said that --
you know, to see.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.567
Mm-hmm.

04:50.567 --> 04:51.933
We had drinks on top of
the World Trade Center

04:51.933 --> 04:54.567
at the River Cafe.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.067
Oh, the River Cafe.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.500
And what was
that experience like?

04:57.500 --> 04:59.667
We had a great time.
Yeah.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.500
We ate good...
Yeah.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.633
...and that would have been

05:02.633 --> 05:04.200
my best experience
of New York City.

05:08.533 --> 05:10.267
Get the  off me,
.

05:10.267 --> 05:11.267
Yeah.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.167
Q: There we go.
That's a laugh.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.367
I did not do well.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.200
So I'm just gonna ask you
a couple questions.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.167
Okay, sure.
Okay,
it's super easy, so...

05:22.167 --> 05:23.533
Here we go. Here we go.

05:23.533 --> 05:24.733
What's one of the best nights

05:24.733 --> 05:26.500
you've had in New York
in the past year?

05:26.500 --> 05:27.633
Probably taking my friends
to paddle.

05:27.633 --> 05:28.667
They didn't know
what the  it was.

05:28.667 --> 05:29.433
Like this S&M club?

05:29.433 --> 05:30.433
You never heard of Paddle?

05:32.200 --> 05:33.867
"Impractical Jokers".
Season 40.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.667
Man: Yeah, we watched people
get spanked and stuff.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.733
It was pretty funny.
Right.

05:36.733 --> 05:38.900
Sal: That's me.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.300
Murr:
That's me completely bald.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.100
That's Q.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.900
That's Joe.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.900
Q: How does he not laugh?
Stone-faced.

05:48.233 --> 05:49.500
That was all for nothing,
though.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.467
So you're with this person,
what do you do?

05:52.467 --> 05:54.433
Times Square is like the thing
that everybody --

05:54.433 --> 05:57.200
Yeah, you know what
I'm saying, though.

05:59.267 --> 06:00.900
You know, Times Square
and all that kind of stuff...
Right.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.067
...so I'd take them
to probably --

06:02.067 --> 06:03.900
Look at how happy
his stupid face is

06:03.900 --> 06:05.800
when it comes out.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.500
No, Times Square is like
the answer with everybody.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.500
Oh, .
Sorry, sorry.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.467
Q:

06:12.467 --> 06:13.500
Oh.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.267
Got you.

06:15.267 --> 06:16.467
That is a laugh,

06:16.467 --> 06:17.933
and the added bonus
of Murray getting hurt.

06:17.933 --> 06:19.767
Okay, would you recommend
that people use

06:19.767 --> 06:21.400
public transportation
in Manhattan?

06:21.400 --> 06:22.467
I have a car.

06:22.467 --> 06:23.400
Murr: There we go.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.067
What do you say is the --

06:28.067 --> 06:29.667
What are some challenges
about apartment living

06:29.667 --> 06:30.833
here in New York?

06:30.833 --> 06:32.367
Man:
Well, there's the price.

06:38.867 --> 06:40.567
Sal: There he goes,
there he goes!

06:40.567 --> 06:41.900
That's a laugh.
That's a laugh.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.833
Oh.
Murr: All right, good job.
We got him.

06:43.833 --> 06:44.933
All right, Q,
you and I are up.
Yes.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.200
Here we go.
Yes.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.633
Could you tell me
an experience

06:47.633 --> 06:48.933
that a live event
gives you?

06:48.933 --> 06:49.933
Really?
Yeah.

06:49.933 --> 06:51.933
Well, I've worked
on the Nets --

06:51.933 --> 06:54.067
Uh, Jay Z, got the Russian guy
running that thing.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.367
Okay.

06:55.367 --> 06:58.400
The guy who, like, runs it,
he was out of town.

06:59.733 --> 07:01.067
Yeah, the Nets.

07:02.267 --> 07:04.267
The next
I would like to see live --

07:04.267 --> 07:06.733
Q:

07:06.733 --> 07:08.400
How the hell
did we even do that?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.967
Yeah, I was just wanting to know
about your act.

07:10.967 --> 07:12.967
What's so funny?
No, it's just --

07:12.967 --> 07:15.067
I had a lot
going on here today.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.300
Joe: Here we go.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.633
Tony: Hey, how are you?

07:21.633 --> 07:23.067
Toni? Sal.
pleasure to meet you.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.167
You want to go first?
Yeah, you want to do this?

07:24.167 --> 07:25.200
All right, let's go.
Here we go.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.833
Describe what would be
a good night out

07:27.833 --> 07:29.100
in New York City for you.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.567
I would actually
compare it --

07:30.567 --> 07:32.867
'cause I did live in D.C.
for a year --

07:32.867 --> 07:34.733
so I guess it depends.

07:34.733 --> 07:36.967
Somewhere with the same...

07:36.967 --> 07:38.767
For a a happy hour?
Yeah.

07:38.767 --> 07:41.667
Joe:
That's a working, pissing dog.

07:41.667 --> 07:42.867
Look at Murray.

07:42.867 --> 07:44.667
Joe:
Yeah.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.400
I mean, go to the club.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.233
I was walking around
Times Square.
Times Square?

07:50.233 --> 07:52.267
It smells like pee
up there.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.067
Good boy, Puddles,
good boy.

07:54.067 --> 07:56.333
Not the first time
I've peed on Murray.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.967
Won't be the last.

07:57.967 --> 07:59.733
Talk to me about
New York City living.

07:59.733 --> 08:01.733
I lived in Brooklyn.

08:01.733 --> 08:03.067
The rent
was pretty expensive.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.767
A bunch of
illegitimate children.

08:08.767 --> 08:10.100
Q: They're all doing
the double Dutch.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.733
Toni: I didn't felt like
it was diverse enough...

08:11.733 --> 08:13.367
Murr: That's a laugh!

08:13.367 --> 08:15.100
...so not really
a good price.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.367
So, guys, I got a surprise
for all of you.

08:16.367 --> 08:18.833
Let's do it.
Enjoy.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.733
Do you have a go-to neighborhood
for shopping?

08:21.733 --> 08:23.367
It's Herald Square.

08:23.367 --> 08:24.367
I feel like there's
a good mixture of both.

08:24.367 --> 08:25.500
It depends on what you want.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.267
Like, there's two H&Ms,
there's a Zara.

08:28.267 --> 08:30.167
Joe: Gamma?
Q: Like the Hulk?

08:30.167 --> 08:31.667
Should he drink it?

08:31.667 --> 08:33.900
I guess a little bit more
to, like, High Street, but --

08:33.900 --> 08:35.700
All right.
He drank it.

08:35.700 --> 08:36.833
Toni:
But not as like --

08:36.833 --> 08:39.167
Uh-oh.
Joe: Oh. Oh.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.067
Something's happening?
Uh-oh.

08:42.300 --> 08:43.733
I hope Murr's all right.
Yeah.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.633
You're can actually find
a better deal,

08:45.633 --> 08:48.467
or just have them delivered it
to this -- you know --

08:48.467 --> 08:50.067
Is that Gary Busey?

08:50.067 --> 08:52.500
Oh, my God!

08:52.500 --> 08:54.100
Oh, my God.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.667
Gary Busey!

08:55.667 --> 08:56.900
It's Gary Busey!
Sal: Oh, my Lord.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.167
That is so, so, so true.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.367
I, uh...

09:00.367 --> 09:02.200
Yeah, that is --
I mean, I mean --

09:02.200 --> 09:04.100
I can't.

09:05.433 --> 09:07.500
I mean, I --

09:07.500 --> 09:09.833
I, uh, you just reminded me
of something.

09:09.833 --> 09:10.667
Oh, my goodness.

09:12.933 --> 09:15.133
Narrator:
Q was a tough nut to crack,

09:15.133 --> 09:17.233
so he's safe
from the loser board.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.433
Today, we're at Food Bazaar
in Long Island City

09:19.433 --> 09:20.900
handing out free samples.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.833
We'll be competing head-to-head,
taking turns,

09:22.833 --> 09:24.067
trying to convince
a customer

09:24.067 --> 09:25.933
to eat as many samples
as possible.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.767
Whoever gives the most away
wins.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.067
I hope I get a customer

09:29.067 --> 09:30.967
that's a tubby little fella
like you.

09:34.367 --> 09:35.867
Sal: Basically, this is
what's gonna happen.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.733
They're each gonna take turns
giving samples,

09:37.733 --> 09:41.633
and then whoever gets stopped,
that person loses.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.333
Murr: Tit-for-tat samples.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.500
Got some free samples.
Samples
if you're interested.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.833
Murr: Here we go.

09:46.833 --> 09:51.533
This is locally grown
mozzarella with basil and oil.

09:51.533 --> 09:52.833
Let me know what you think.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.867
Sal:
Locally grown mozzarella?

09:56.200 --> 09:57.767
If you're
a cheese guy --

09:57.767 --> 09:59.867
Oh, yeah,
there you go.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.433
All: Ah.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.833
Sal: All right,
he's in for two.
It's on Joe.

10:03.833 --> 10:06.367
It would behoove us
if you do it with --

10:06.367 --> 10:07.700
this is sharp cheddar.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.200
You don't look like you eat
too much cheese.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.667
Yeah, but you got to have
all three.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.033
That's probably like
40 calories,

10:12.033 --> 10:13.600
50 calories.
Yeah, that's the real --

10:13.600 --> 10:14.800
That's the deal with it.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.233
Sal: Oh, he gets him.
He gets him!

10:16.233 --> 10:18.067
Murr: Joe gets him
on the third one.
Okay.

10:18.067 --> 10:19.400
Pressure's on Q.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.367
You like olives?
'Cause olives go down with that.

10:21.367 --> 10:22.933
So the mozzarella
and then the olives, yeah.

10:22.933 --> 10:24.200
Ah, there we go.
Kalamata olives.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.467
Murr:
Oh, he took Q's olive.
Sal: Oh!

10:26.467 --> 10:27.800
How's that...?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.333
We actually re-did
the whole olive.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.067
How's that cold you had?
You over that cold yet?

10:31.067 --> 10:32.700
'Cause you were coughing a lot
earlier.
I sneezed on yours.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.133
Sal:

10:34.133 --> 10:35.367
Try the other olive.
Tell us what you like better.

10:35.367 --> 10:36.633
You're still a little pale
around the face.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.233
Yeah, there you go.
Just let me know which one.

10:38.233 --> 10:39.400
It doesn't matter.
And they said
that was really contagious?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.733
Sal:
Joe has convinced him.

10:40.733 --> 10:42.200
Yeah,
you can't stop the train.

10:43.733 --> 10:45.000
Now it's on Q.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.067
That's great.
Did you try
the chips yet?

10:47.067 --> 10:48.200
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, there you go.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.300
Q: Yeah,
those are the best.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.300
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.267
Wow.

10:56.267 --> 10:57.533
It's on Joe.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.900
Do you like the stick,
or do you like, the chip?

11:01.900 --> 11:03.300
These are
the house-made ones.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.967
Nah.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.300
You had
one of those already.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.467
Yeah?
Yeah, you had this.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.300
So then
this is the other one,

11:09.300 --> 11:11.233
so you've got to tell us
which one you like better.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.633
That's the way it works.
Murr: Oh!

11:12.633 --> 11:13.767
You like
the house one better?

11:13.767 --> 11:14.800
Here,
take these with you.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.367
Take these with you.
Sal: It's on Q!

11:16.367 --> 11:17.567
Just don't forget
to take all of them.

11:17.567 --> 11:18.500
I got one more, too,
there.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.567
Sal:
Who's chip is he trying?

11:20.567 --> 11:22.400
There you go.
That one's mine, yeah.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.067
I think that one's mine,
too.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.267
That one's mine, too.
-No, it's not.

11:27.267 --> 11:28.733
No, it's not!
I gave the sample!

11:30.433 --> 11:32.700
Hey, hey, feed me.

11:32.700 --> 11:33.933
You ate it.

11:33.933 --> 11:35.433
Nothing against me
eating it.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.600
Sal:
Murr: All right.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.633
That's it. Q's up.

11:38.633 --> 11:40.067
All right.
Well done. Well done.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.233
Thank you, buddy.
Take care of yourself.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.500
Thank you, brother.
Thank you very much.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.633
Yeah, and just one more
for the road.

11:43.633 --> 11:44.700
Murr: Oh!

11:44.700 --> 11:45.767
There you go, bud.

11:45.767 --> 11:47.233
No, don't eat that!

11:47.233 --> 11:48.700
Don't eat that.
Eat it, eat it,
eat it, eat it.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.200
Come on!
Eat it, eat it,
eat it, eat it.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.367
Is he gonna eat it?
He's gonna eat it.

11:52.367 --> 11:53.500
He's gonna eat it.
He's gonna eat it!

11:53.500 --> 11:54.900
Joe: Eat it.
Let me see, eat it, go ahead.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.067
Go, go, go, go.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.767
Q:

12:00.333 --> 12:02.600
Joe wins at the buzzer.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.200
Sal: Oh, my God.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.100
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

12:08.967 --> 12:12.333
So here we have kinder,
gentler Sal and Murr.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.800
Yes. That's right.
Their relationship's somewhat
improved this season.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.100
Our relationship
has thawed a little bit.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.333
Thawed.
Yes.

12:18.333 --> 12:21.133
It's not as frozen cold
as it once was.

12:21.133 --> 12:23.933
Can I borrow
the chapstick?
Never.

12:25.333 --> 12:26.467
Some things never change.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.433
Yes,
would you like to try any?

12:29.433 --> 12:31.433
Oh, we have so many different
things from local places.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.200
Come on around.
Joe:
All right, here we go.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.167
Samples I give you are
going to be the best
ones you ever have.

12:35.167 --> 12:36.367
I promise you.
Okay.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.667
I'm gonna start you off
with the fresh mozzarella

12:38.667 --> 12:41.400
dipped in
a little olive oil.
Delicious.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.067
Q: Oh, Murr,
it's on you, buddy.

12:43.067 --> 12:46.267
This is a sharp cheddar,
locally made, delicious.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.667
Farm in Jersey.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.567
Don't fill up on that,
though.

12:50.567 --> 12:51.700
One bite just
so you can taste it

12:51.700 --> 12:52.933
'cause I want you
to taste the difference

12:52.933 --> 12:54.133
between that cheese
and this cheese.

12:54.133 --> 12:55.600
So just one bite each.

12:57.533 --> 12:59.900
Q:
Oh, it's back to Murray.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.267
It is, right?
That one's better.
Okay.

13:01.267 --> 13:03.867
If you like that one,
you are going to love --

13:03.867 --> 13:05.467
This is a white cheddar.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.933
Try that.
Again, made locally.
It's mild, though.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.933
Delicious.
This is Spanish olive

13:10.933 --> 13:12.533
with a little
bleu cheese stuffing.

13:12.533 --> 13:15.067
If you've never tried it,
I would like you to try it, too.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.800
Joe: Sal, nice.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.833
Murr's up.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.933
Yeah.
Q:
Olive with the bleu cheese.

13:21.933 --> 13:27.067
Speaking of which,
I happen to have one more.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.400
Come on,
you're shopping.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.700
There you go.
You're gonna ruin
your appetite.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.933
You don't need that.
You can put it right there.

13:30.933 --> 13:32.167
Now,
we're even, even, even.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.600
Don't feel forced, ma'am,
don't feel forced.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.967
No, no, no.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.667
Up your ass
and to the left.

13:38.667 --> 13:38.767
It's up your ass
and to the left.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
Up your ass
and to the left.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.267
It's --

13:42.267 --> 13:44.400
It's...up your ass
and to the left.

13:46.733 --> 13:49.367
It's, uh, straight up your ass
and to the left.

13:50.267 --> 13:52.233
We call that aisle
"up your --"

13:54.733 --> 13:56.233
Q: All right,
let's get back to work.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.633
OH, we don't want to keep you
if you have to get going.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.500
Joe:
Q: Nice try, Murr.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.933
These are vegetable chips,

14:00.933 --> 14:03.800
and they're made
with pure peanut oil.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.067
Joe: Oh, my God,
she's in for a veggie chip.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.700
Sal: Oh, yeah.
You don't have to try
that one.

14:11.867 --> 14:13.267
This is unbelievable.

14:13.267 --> 14:14.700
The only thing
better than that

14:14.700 --> 14:17.200
is chocolate-covered
pretzels.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.267
Q: Uh-oh.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.200
Oh, you don't want this?
Joe: Ah!

14:21.200 --> 14:23.200
You're in this deep.
You might as well just try it.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.633
Joe: You're out!

14:28.633 --> 14:30.167
They draw the line
at the chocolate pretzel?

14:30.167 --> 14:31.333
They ate 47 items.

14:32.533 --> 14:34.300
Q: Wow.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.333
Narrator:
Q and Murr got all chewed up,

14:36.333 --> 14:39.333
which makes Murr
tonight's big loser.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.433
Oh, all right, all right.

14:40.433 --> 14:42.067
So you might notice
Murray's not here.

14:42.067 --> 14:44.233
That's 'cause the other day,
we were watching "Taken."

14:44.233 --> 14:45.767
Yes.
As we do.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.967
And we decided that
it would be fun

14:47.967 --> 14:50.600
if for Murr's next punishment,
he got taken.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.400
Murr has no idea
that he's on camera.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.500
Murr: Thank you, man.
Right now he thinks
he's on his way

14:54.500 --> 14:55.500
to shoot a challenge.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.867
Good timing.

14:56.867 --> 14:59.067
Man:
Staten Island, right?
Yes, sir.

14:59.067 --> 15:02.067
Q: His driver
is really our guy

15:02.067 --> 15:04.267
who's taking him
where we want him to go,

15:04.267 --> 15:05.833
which isn't gonna be fun
for Murr.
No.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.933
But definitely fun
for us.
Oh, yeah, of course.

15:07.933 --> 15:10.100
So enjoy
Murray being taken.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.633
We have a specific
set of skills.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.767
Murr:
Yeah, can you hear me, dad?

15:14.767 --> 15:16.267
We're filming on Staten Island

15:16.267 --> 15:18.333
at the YMCA on Richmond Avenue
and Amboy Road.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.200
I wanted to see if you guys
wanted to come to set.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.433
Oh,
Murray just texted me.

15:21.433 --> 15:22.900
"Dad is coming to set today,
"guys.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.300
I'm taking him to lunch
afterwards

15:24.300 --> 15:25.567
around the corner
from the Y.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.167
You guys are welcome to join.
My treat."

15:27.167 --> 15:28.300
We're not
going to the Y.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.633
How about 1:00?
Can you be ready by 1:00?

15:31.633 --> 15:34.067
Joe: When he sees the driver's
going a different way,

15:34.067 --> 15:35.867
he's gonna start getting
inquisitive.
Right.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.067
Oh, oh!

15:41.067 --> 15:42.633
Why'd you get off
the highway?

15:43.967 --> 15:45.067
Really?

15:47.800 --> 15:50.067
Look how annoyed he is.
He's pulling out the GPS.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.267
Where you going now?

15:54.267 --> 15:56.067
Is it telling you to do,
like, a left?

15:57.867 --> 15:59.800
No, no. You're going
the wrong way entirely now.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.433
Now you're going to
the 3rd.

16:01.433 --> 16:02.967
This is not right at all.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.167
You're going the wrong way.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.100
No, no, no, no!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.733
Where we going?
'Cause he's going the wrong way.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.533
No,
he's going the right way.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.433
Murr, you've been taken.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.167
Taken where?
This is not my punishment.

16:26.167 --> 16:28.067
This is not
my punishment day!

16:28.067 --> 16:29.567
Oh, yes, it is.
Listen to me.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.833
You better call your dad
and cancel that lunch

16:31.833 --> 16:33.900
'cause it ain't gonna
happen today, buddy.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.833
Am I mic'd?
Is there a mic in here?

16:35.833 --> 16:36.900
Son of a bitch,

16:36.900 --> 16:38.233
there's a hidden camera
right there.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.133
And there's another one!

16:41.133 --> 16:43.067
I hate you guys.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.867
You know what?
First step was, we take Murr.

16:44.867 --> 16:47.100
Now we're gonna take the car.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.867
Here we go. Here we go.

16:48.867 --> 16:51.433
Hey, Dad,
we have a change of plans, okay?

16:53.133 --> 16:54.700
What the hell?

16:54.700 --> 16:56.067
Hey, Dad,
there's a change of plans.

16:56.067 --> 16:57.300
Sal:
The car is on the flatbed.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.067
They're punishing me today,
actually.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.367
Q: He's trying to
talk to his dad

17:00.367 --> 17:01.567
while they're
hooking him up.

17:03.933 --> 17:05.133
We're not filming at the YMCA.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.400
I'm down by the ferry now.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.600
They switched it
and they're punishing me.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.700
I don't know
what they're doing.

17:10.433 --> 17:11.633
Where's he going?

17:14.167 --> 17:15.867
We're gonna keep on moving,
pal.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.733
Murr:
Where's this guy going?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.567
Windows are locked,
doors are locked.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.600
Joe:
He's locked in the car.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.200
The car is chained down.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.433
He has no control
over what he's doing at all.

17:26.433 --> 17:28.067
Q: It's really a euphemism
for his life.

17:29.267 --> 17:31.433
Sal: There he is.

17:31.433 --> 17:32.533
There you go.

17:32.533 --> 17:33.733
Right over there.

17:33.733 --> 17:36.133
What is going on?

17:36.133 --> 17:38.067
Let me out of this car.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.733
What the hell?

17:42.367 --> 17:43.800
What's going on?

17:43.800 --> 17:45.633
We took you,
we put you in the car.
Murr: Yeah.

17:45.633 --> 17:46.900
We took the car,
we put it in the truck.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.300
Yeah.
We took the truck,

17:48.300 --> 17:49.933
we put it on a boat.
Yeah.

17:49.933 --> 17:50.967
There's more.

17:52.467 --> 17:53.933
There's more.

17:55.733 --> 17:57.500
Wave, wave.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.533
You know, it's
about 100 degrees in this car.

17:59.533 --> 18:01.300
Murr, don't worry, you're gonna
cool down real quick, buddy.

18:02.467 --> 18:03.933
Stop saying that.
Am I getting wet?

18:03.933 --> 18:05.200
Am I getting wet?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.367
There she is, boys.

18:07.367 --> 18:09.633
The Statue of Liberty --
Look at that.

18:09.633 --> 18:12.167
-Look at it.
-Lady Liberty.

18:12.167 --> 18:13.367
-Beautiful.
-I got to tell you guys,

18:13.367 --> 18:14.733
this is a great punishment.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.533
I've never been this close
to the Statue of Liberty before.

18:16.533 --> 18:19.500
Okay, Murr, we're here.
You can get out.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.167
-Step on out, buddy.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.100
Q: There he is.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.367
Joe: Just hop down
and open that trunk.

18:28.367 --> 18:31.300
Who's the most Lady Liberty
out of all of us?

18:31.300 --> 18:32.700
Q: Well,
it's definitely not me.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.100
Nah, it's
definitely not me.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.633
There's really only one
real Lady Liberty in our group.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.400
Murr, you're
our Lady Liberty.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.200
You're the ferret
of liberty, buddy.
That's it.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.067
Is this is a microphone?
This is so stupid!

18:47.067 --> 18:48.667
Can you hear that?

18:48.667 --> 18:50.833
All right, beautiful.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.600
Murr: Where you going?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.433
Oh, come on!

18:56.433 --> 18:59.200
Ooh! Ooh!
It is so cold out here.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.533
How are
your baby balls?

19:00.533 --> 19:02.433
They're nonexistent now.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.333
Yeah, Murr, at least you can
blame it on shrinkage this time.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.967
There's
all these tourist ships.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.100
Okay, Murr, get
on your box here

19:11.100 --> 19:13.800
so all the passersby
can see you.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.567
Oh, my gosh.

19:16.567 --> 19:18.900
-Come on, Lady Liberty.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.600
Yeah, here you go.
Put it up!

19:20.600 --> 19:23.333
Put it

19:23.333 --> 19:24.433
Man: Over here
to our left-hand side,

19:24.433 --> 19:26.067
there's some dude
out here posing

19:26.067 --> 19:28.400
as the Statue of Liberty over
here to our left-hand side.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.267
-Yes.
-No!

19:31.267 --> 19:33.633
All these tourists,
they're all looking at me!

19:33.633 --> 19:35.867
Joe: Oh, look at them all taking
pictures of him!

19:35.867 --> 19:38.300
You're upstaging
the real Statue of Liberty.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.367
Murr: The real Statue is
right there!

19:41.367 --> 19:42.633
Look that way!

19:44.233 --> 19:46.400
This is so stupid.
-Pose.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.567
Come on!

19:49.567 --> 19:51.333
Some tourists
from Germany are booing him.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.933
-It's 30 degrees!

19:52.933 --> 19:54.267
I have shrinkage!

19:54.267 --> 19:56.367
Q: Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

19:56.367 --> 19:58.233
Tour's over!
Go home!

19:58.233 --> 19:59.267
Sal: Well done, buddy.

19:59.267 --> 20:01.633
All right, guys,
I got Murr a way home.

20:01.633 --> 20:02.867
I'm not taking that home.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.700
Are you serious?
-Good luck.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.233
Sal: We'll see you
back at shore.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.667
No, no, come on.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.133
Hey, you guys want to go have
lunch with Murray's father?

20:15.567 --> 20:16.733
Joe:
Murr, we got to go.

20:16.733 --> 20:18.267
We're late
for lunch with your dad.

20:18.267 --> 20:19.633
You're joking, right?

20:19.633 --> 20:21.533
No, I'm not.
Pose.

20:23.267 --> 20:27.167
**

20:27.167 --> 20:28.600
Welcome
to "Impractical Insider."

20:28.600 --> 20:29.933
We're here
at the scene of the crime.

20:29.933 --> 20:32.800
This is where Murray just
got punished on the high seas.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.333
We're gonna show you
a behind-the-scenes look

20:34.333 --> 20:35.500
of how it all went down.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.100
I'm also gonna show you
some bonus content

20:37.100 --> 20:38.733
from tonight's episode.

20:38.733 --> 20:41.033
So, the guys are getting
their makeup right now

20:41.033 --> 20:42.467
just because, you know,

20:42.467 --> 20:44.267
they don't want to have
too much shine.

20:44.267 --> 20:45.700
These are industry terms.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.200
We don't really want makeup.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.667
They make us put it on.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.800
-I know. Of course.
-Yeah.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.633
-Because it's still --
-Take care of my bags.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.300
He likes his makeup.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.433
I don't care
about the makeup.

20:56.433 --> 20:58.433
I need more makeup
than Sal does

20:58.433 --> 21:03.233
because Sal is more
naturally superior with looks.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.733
I'm a disgusting,
fat

21:07.600 --> 21:09.100
Casey: Look at
all this stuff, right?

21:09.100 --> 21:11.333
This is what it takes
to make a television show

21:11.333 --> 21:14.533
like "Impractical Jokers" --
a lot of these cases.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.633
How are you feeling
about this Murr punishment?

21:16.633 --> 21:19.333
Uh, it's great, man.
He doesn't know.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.633
He's the one
always saying we should get

21:20.633 --> 21:22.533
into your personal life
and do it.
Yeah.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.800
So it's nice to have that blow
back immediately in his face.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.067
I'm very excited
about that.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.067
Hey, guys, we should
really think about a way

21:28.067 --> 21:29.533
to infiltrate
the people's real life.

21:31.467 --> 21:32.533
That's what happens
on the show.

21:32.533 --> 21:34.367
You open your mouth,
and you pay for it.

21:34.367 --> 21:37.833
They're going to call Murr
on this iPad.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.933
Look at this.
This is awesome.

21:39.933 --> 21:41.833
Sal: Whoa!

21:41.833 --> 21:43.967
No, no, no, no, no!

21:43.967 --> 21:45.167
No, no, no, no.

21:45.167 --> 21:46.600
We're here in Staten Island,

21:46.600 --> 21:48.900
and you can get a shot there
of one of the outer boroughs.

21:48.900 --> 21:52.500
It's called Manhattan.
It's a little island.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.100
So what does Murr know
right now?

21:54.100 --> 21:56.600
He knows
he's a piece of

21:56.600 --> 21:58.767
Aside from that,
as far as the punishment.
Murr knows nothing.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.100
He just knows
that he's been taken.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.267
Joe: He's keeping
his seatbelt on just in case.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.433
Murr: It's not cool, man.
Where we going?

22:05.433 --> 22:07.467
-Seconds away.

22:07.467 --> 22:08.800
Murr is
about to get pulled in.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.233
Okay, so, I should get
out of here?

22:10.233 --> 22:12.267
You should probably leave.

22:12.267 --> 22:15.600
-There he is.
-Let me out of this car.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.367
Casey: So, we're hanging out
here in the boat.

22:17.367 --> 22:19.933
And we're just waiting for
some cameras to get into place.

22:19.933 --> 22:21.467
**

22:21.467 --> 22:23.067
-I used to own a boat.

22:23.067 --> 22:25.100
And I used to take
my shirt off and go fishing.

22:29.433 --> 22:30.700
Murr:
What the hell?

22:30.700 --> 22:32.167
Oh, come on.

22:32.167 --> 22:33.633
This is unbelievable.

22:33.633 --> 22:35.333
Casey: He's getting
into costume right now.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.067
This is so dumb.

22:37.067 --> 22:40.067
Andrew Hood is the one who
put this whole car together.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.533
Well, you didn't build
the car.
No, no, no, no, no.

22:42.533 --> 22:43.933
But we put
the hidden cameras in it.

22:43.933 --> 22:46.200
I really don't see anything,
and I guess that was the point.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.333
Yeah, we kind of
just put it plain sight.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.200
There's one
that's like a security camera

22:50.200 --> 22:51.467
you'd normally find
in a taxi.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.167
-Oh, okay, I see that.
-And then we kind of snuck

22:53.167 --> 22:55.600
one in the side by the door
over your left shoulder --

22:55.600 --> 22:56.933
right there
back in the corner.

22:56.933 --> 22:59.133
Son of a bitch, there's
a hidden camera right there.

22:59.133 --> 23:01.933
And there's another one.

23:01.933 --> 23:03.533
I hate you guys.

23:03.533 --> 23:05.700
Casey:
James, you having fun?

23:05.700 --> 23:08.167
Shut up, Casey!

23:08.167 --> 23:09.567
There you go.

23:09.567 --> 23:11.500
Oh, my gosh.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.667
All these tourists,
they're all looking at me!

23:13.667 --> 23:15.867
Look that way!

23:15.867 --> 23:19.667
**

23:19.667 --> 23:22.067
Q: Is that Gary Busey?!

23:22.067 --> 23:23.467
Oh, my God!

23:23.467 --> 23:25.700
He got Gary Busey
to come in and Hulk out?

23:25.700 --> 23:28.067
-That's amazing.
-Oh, my God.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.533
Hi, guys!

23:33.533 --> 23:36.567
Oh, my God.
My mind's blown right now.

23:36.567 --> 23:38.067
Here's one for you guys.

23:38.067 --> 23:40.367
I want you this
in your vocabulary.

23:40.367 --> 23:41.833
The word "fart"...
-"Fart."

23:41.833 --> 23:43.333
-...F-A-R-T...
-Mm-hmm.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.367
stands for,

23:44.367 --> 23:46.300
"feeling
a rectal transmission."

23:46.300 --> 23:49.667
Q: I'm feeling it right now.
I'm feeling it right now.

23:51.233 --> 23:53.133
I love you guys
so much.
