WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:08.202
Spacecataz.

00:08.241 --> 00:09.970
They are so stuck
with that bill.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.911
It's not even funny.
But I'm laughing anyway.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.038
Ha ha ha!

00:14.080 --> 00:15.877
Oh, man, are those meat-cravers?

00:15.915 --> 00:17.507
Well, four million of them are.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.211
I had some with olives, too.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.776
I remembered they liked that.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.878
I'm not Satan.

00:21.921 --> 00:24.515
You think maybe they'll, uh,
they'll, you know, get pissed...

00:24.557 --> 00:27.219
and maybe prank us
and order us a bunch of pizzas?

00:27.260 --> 00:28.921
Yeah, that smells pretty good.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.759
I think I'm getting
kind of hungry.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.229
Me, too.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.495
Dudes!

00:34.534 --> 00:38.026
My name is Shake-Zula

00:38.071 --> 00:40.266
The mike ruler,
the old schooler

00:40.306 --> 00:42.331
You want to trip?
I'll bring it to ya

00:42.375 --> 00:45.503
Frylock and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop

00:45.545 --> 00:48.309
Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock

00:48.348 --> 00:50.646
Meatwad make the money, see?

00:50.683 --> 00:53.083
Meatwad get the honeys, G

00:53.119 --> 00:55.679
Driving in my car,
living like a star

00:55.722 --> 00:57.553
Ice on my fingers
and my toes

00:57.590 --> 00:59.421
And I'm a Taurus

00:59.459 --> 01:01.586
Uh, check-check it, yeah

01:01.628 --> 01:03.619
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

01:03.663 --> 01:07.258
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

01:07.300 --> 01:09.598
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

01:09.636 --> 01:12.662
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

01:12.705 --> 01:14.570
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

01:14.607 --> 01:17.098
Number one in the hood, G.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.509
Oh, God! How much longer?

01:19.546 --> 01:22.572
Egypt is so boring!
It doesn't even exist!

01:22.615 --> 01:25.379
I mean, you don't hear
DMX rap about it.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.318
I find that this is
highly effilligent...

01:27.353 --> 01:29.981
and edumacationist
for my brain...

01:30.023 --> 01:32.287
because I am smart, boy.

01:32.325 --> 01:33.758
You tell me how this
is gonna help you...

01:33.793 --> 01:35.420
get a high power,
six-figure job.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.623
You think they ask
Tom Cruise this stuff...

01:37.664 --> 01:39.461
before he signs on his movies?

01:39.499 --> 01:41.364
No one has to know this ever!

01:41.401 --> 01:42.527
Shake, just go back
to the gift shop...

01:42.569 --> 01:44.298
and let Meatwad and I
enjoy the exhibit, OK?

01:44.337 --> 01:45.531
You need me here.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.200
I am a strong counterpoint
to the headphone.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.833
Hey, who's this old boy here?

01:49.876 --> 01:51.104
Is that DMX?

01:51.144 --> 01:53.009
Oh, that's Osiris,
the Egyptian god of the dead.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.411
Hey! Hey, look!

01:54.447 --> 01:56.074
Over here. Look at this.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.913
What's that mean in Egypto?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.385
Well, that's you telling me
to sit and spin.

02:00.487 --> 02:01.920
Bingo! Now do it.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.752
Shut up, Shake,
I'm trying to hear this.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.987
Legend has it that Osiris,
the Egyptian god of the dead...

02:07.026 --> 02:09.425
wore this ancient T-shirt
on hot days in his...

02:09.461 --> 02:11.054
under...

02:11.097 --> 02:12.564
in the underworld.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.396
It was given to him
by an ancient...

02:14.434 --> 02:15.765
Oh, my god

02:15.802 --> 02:17.565
I am the boringest guy
in the world

02:17.604 --> 02:18.628
Shake, shut up.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.333
Some say it gave him the power
to know and do anything.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.603
And that's why most
of the dead...

02:24.644 --> 02:28.375
in the underworld
referred to him as... an ass.

02:28.414 --> 02:29.438
Wow.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.746
Damn! That is some kind
of magic T-shirt.

02:31.784 --> 02:32.808
Yeah, it is.

02:32.852 --> 02:34.114
Now continue to your left...

02:34.154 --> 02:37.317
and view Egypt's pathetic
and ignorant attempt...

02:37.357 --> 02:38.881
at a cellular phone.

02:38.925 --> 02:39.949
Come on, Shake.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.928
You go ahead.
I'll be right there.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.726
Look at you. You thinkin' about
stealing that shirt, ain't you?

02:45.765 --> 02:48.165
I'm thinking about it, yes.

02:48.201 --> 02:50.726
- Now, take the form of a hammer.
- OK.

02:55.141 --> 02:57.041
Now what?

02:57.076 --> 02:59.067
Hey, how you doing?

02:59.112 --> 03:02.479
No. It's mine! No way!
I'm keeping this.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.483
I had to get him
in trouble for this.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.178
You think I like getting
my friends in trouble?

03:06.219 --> 03:07.311
I didn't say anything.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.753
You thought it.
I read your mind!

03:09.789 --> 03:11.188
Oh, yeah?
Well, what am I thinking?

03:11.224 --> 03:12.714
Ho ho ho ho. Oh, that's cute.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.522
You're trying to come up
with something...

03:14.561 --> 03:16.222
for me to think of,
but you can't...

03:16.262 --> 03:19.026
'cause your brain
is permanently unplugged.

03:19.065 --> 03:20.396
You know, he may be right.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.333
I think that
that T-shirt does work.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.859
Well, Shake, I do know that you
are gonna take that T-shirt back.

03:24.904 --> 03:26.872
But this gives me the power
to know it all.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.533
Well, back there,
you said it gave you...

03:28.575 --> 03:30.805
the power to read minds.
So, which is it?

03:30.843 --> 03:32.674
Um...

03:32.712 --> 03:33.974
I don't know.

03:34.013 --> 03:36.004
But you said
that you know it all.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.649
And now you say you don't know?

03:39.686 --> 03:41.483
It has powers, OK!

03:41.521 --> 03:43.182
Everyone, OK?!

03:44.524 --> 03:46.424
And now you're gonna say
it smells like ass.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.154
Because it does
smell like ass, man.

03:48.194 --> 03:49.923
That T-shirt is over
five million years old.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.055
You know what I'm thinking?

03:51.097 --> 03:53.793
That you better wash the ass
out of that shirt.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.926
Well, who better to wash
the ass out of that shirt...

03:55.969 --> 03:57.561
than my slave...
which is you!

03:57.604 --> 04:00.368
Go forth to the washroom
and work for my health...

04:00.473 --> 04:01.701
you dirty jackal!

04:01.741 --> 04:04.175
What the hell's taking so long?

04:04.210 --> 04:06.542
You need to chill.
I've got a whole load in here.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.571
A load?! What could you
possibly have in there?

04:09.616 --> 04:11.174
You're prancing
around here naked...

04:11.217 --> 04:13.481
like you're livin'
the freakin' summer of love!

04:13.519 --> 04:15.316
I'm washing
my Christmas sock, boy.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.915
I want to be prepared...
for when Santa comes.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.982
Santa is not coming this summer!

04:20.026 --> 04:22.084
Yes, he is!
I put on your T-shirt...

04:22.128 --> 04:23.993
and called out to him
with my brainwaves.

04:24.030 --> 04:27.261
You did what?!
The T-shirt is not to be abused!

04:27.300 --> 04:30.064
It is to be thrown in there
with a full bottle of bleach...

04:30.103 --> 04:32.037
in very hot water.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.562
Shake, I read the tag.
It said cold water only.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.167
Oh, yeah, like you can read
a bunch of birds and squiggles.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.302
I can.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.039
I decide what will be
airbrushed on the back!

04:42.315 --> 04:43.475
- All right.
- All right!

04:43.516 --> 04:47.418
Oh, shoot. Look at this. Faded.
Hey, here's your thing.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.284
Well, at least it's clean,
you know what I mean?

04:49.322 --> 04:51.381
Yeah, and as soon as
I get it on...

04:51.424 --> 04:53.153
I'm gonna clean out
your little skull...

04:53.192 --> 04:54.989
with a possessed
ice cream spoon...

04:55.028 --> 04:57.588
but I'm gonna have a demon do it
because I'm very tired.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.962
- Shake, stop.
- Someone please yank on this.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.727
Shake! Shake, stop!
You're gonna rip it.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.531
- Rip this. It'll fit.
- No, it won't.

05:03.569 --> 05:04.831
- Yes, it will.
- No, it won't.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.702
The only person who can
wear this now is Meatwad.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.604
Hello, hand-me-down.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.472
Oh, yeah? Well, put it on.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.444
- And do my bidding!
- OK.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.709
Uhh. There we go.
What do you bid?

05:15.748 --> 05:18.546
Let's, uh...
why don't we call up a...

05:18.584 --> 05:21.451
oh, I know!
How about a plague of snakes...

05:21.487 --> 05:22.977
to devour you
for your insolence!

05:23.022 --> 05:24.455
OK, hang on.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.388
Ha! Hey! Let's play
hide-and-seek, Meatwad!

05:28.428 --> 05:30.896
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- What the...

05:30.930 --> 05:32.693
is that the plague of snakes
I asked for?

05:32.732 --> 05:33.858
I don't know.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.130
Hey, is you the plague of snakes
he asked for?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.364
Uh-uh. I'm the Easter bunny!

05:38.404 --> 05:41.430
- He the Easter bunny.
- I know that!

05:41.474 --> 05:42.668
Well, let me... let me...

05:42.709 --> 05:44.404
let me take another crack at it,
hold on.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.506
I'm the Easter bunny's
twin brother... Darryl!

05:48.548 --> 05:49.742
This is ridiculous!

05:49.782 --> 05:51.511
You know what?
I'm just gonna go to the mall.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.916
I'll have my cell phone on, OK?

05:52.952 --> 05:55.386
In case something goes wrong,
hit me on the cell.

05:55.421 --> 05:59.118
Well, I feel like we got
a communication breakdown here.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.022
'Cause, you know,
you say snakes...

06:01.060 --> 06:02.459
and all I hear from you is...

06:02.495 --> 06:04.463
Easter bunny, Easter bunny,
Easter bunny.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.557
All right, look, let's just go
with something simple first.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.363
All right.
Here's something simple.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.302
- Ho ho ho!
- Santa Claus!

06:11.337 --> 06:12.895
What is wrong with you?!

06:12.939 --> 06:16.397
Master Shake,
you've been a naughty boy today.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.909
Don't play with me, fat man!

06:17.944 --> 06:19.468
Santa, did you get my letter?!

06:19.512 --> 06:22.913
Meatwad, why did you call me
in the middle of July?

06:22.949 --> 06:24.917
I want me some presents.
I've been a good boy...

06:24.951 --> 06:26.441
for the first quarter
of this year...

06:26.486 --> 06:27.851
and most of the second quarter.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.117
It's the middle of... July!

06:30.156 --> 06:32.090
- I was sleeping.
- Well, but I...

06:32.125 --> 06:34.650
The sweet little elves don't
even come in till September.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.161
OK, but, well...

06:36.195 --> 06:39.596
I want a unicorn with a horn
and a banana seat...

06:39.632 --> 06:42.100
and a banana suit, too.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.568
Put... give me that.

06:43.603 --> 06:47.334
Well, I'll just waltz on down
to the free present store!

06:47.373 --> 06:50.103
You think I have money
to buy all that?

06:50.143 --> 06:51.337
Oh, please no.

06:51.377 --> 06:52.776
No, not that kind of horn!

06:52.812 --> 06:54.177
Come on, use your head.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.578
Well, I didn't do it.
You did it.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.139
- Oh.
- Does anyone have any coffee?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.545
Eh, getting there.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.954
I'm sorry. He just woke me up,
and it pisses me off.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.719
Oh, that'll work... for now.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.817
But no telling
what I'm gonna want later.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.327
All right, stop.
This is my shirt...

07:09.362 --> 07:11.660
and you are not
abusing it properly.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.460
Look out there, then.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.826
How's that grab you?

07:16.869 --> 07:20.999
Ho ho ho ho!
What is going on out here?

07:22.241 --> 07:24.471
Why, it's a big old
happy Easter egg...

07:24.510 --> 07:25.568
Oh, god!

07:27.847 --> 07:31.044
Hey! There's a freakin'
Easter egg in my yard!

07:31.083 --> 07:33.483
Well, that's probably
Eggzilla, Carl.

07:33.519 --> 07:36.352
He's that fire-breathing
Easter egg come out of my mind.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.515
Of course!

07:37.557 --> 07:39.149
Well, it could be
his girlfriend.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.591
My suit is melting into my skin!

07:40.626 --> 07:43.151
'Cause in my mind now,
he's going steady.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.686
Oh, yeah. No,
there's two of them now.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.129
He's at the prom.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.065
Hey, make sure the house
is completely crushed...

07:48.100 --> 07:49.590
if you could.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.398
That's OK. They're in love.
Hey, where you going?

07:51.437 --> 07:53.803
Hey, what are you doing?
You missed my car!

07:53.840 --> 07:56.308
Help me out with this!
Yeah, there we go!

07:57.844 --> 07:59.869
Oh, my God,
what is going on here?

07:59.979 --> 08:01.173
Didn't I tell you to call me?!

08:01.214 --> 08:02.738
Well, hell,
I ain't got your number.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.750
Oh, thank you, Frylock.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.217
Oh.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.117
If I survive...

08:08.154 --> 08:11.123
I'm gonna beat the...
out of that little meatball!

08:11.157 --> 08:13.182
Look, Santa, I am so sorry.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.353
Meatwad just got a little
carried away, that's all.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.521
He got a lot carried away.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.861
You know that remote controlled
race car he wants?

08:19.899 --> 08:21.730
Oh, yeah, he's gonna get it...

08:21.767 --> 08:23.860
far up his ass!

08:23.903 --> 08:26.133
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, now, Santa.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.402
I might see if the reindeer
like meat this year!

08:28.441 --> 08:29.533
Now, please. Now, Santa,
you don't want...

08:29.575 --> 08:30.667
Get out of my way.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.438
Don't try to get up.
You need to rest and...

08:32.477 --> 08:35.777
Oh, and you! You're his
ass-wipe roommate, aren't you?

08:35.815 --> 08:38.682
Oh, if I go down,
who will deliver the toys?

08:38.717 --> 08:39.844
- Toys? I...
- You?!

08:39.885 --> 08:40.943
I don't know.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.477
You have no idea
how it works, do you?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.616
Don't even have a clue.
You know what?

08:45.658 --> 08:47.023
Let me borrow your phone.

08:47.059 --> 08:49.050
Ho ho ho ho.
I'm gonna call the police.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.756
No. No, I don't think so.
You're not gonna do that.

08:50.796 --> 08:53.788
Is that... is that a mirror?
Bring that to me.

08:53.833 --> 08:54.993
How does my face look?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.968
- Well...
- Like a... monster.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.061
No! No, you...

08:58.104 --> 09:00.629
Oh, kids aren't gonna want
to see me under the mistletoe...

09:00.673 --> 09:02.538
No, no, no! You're OK.
You're all right.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.509
Soon as you grow your beard back
and your eyebrows.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.944
I'm Horror Claus. Oh, God!

09:08.114 --> 09:09.411
It's getting cold in here.

09:09.448 --> 09:10.710
Uh-oh, you're going into shock.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.308
- No, I'm not!
- Meatwad, get in here!

09:12.351 --> 09:14.251
Yeah, take a look
at what you've done to me!

09:14.287 --> 09:15.515
- Yes, sir?
- You need to fix this!

09:15.555 --> 09:17.455
Fix what...
oh, my goodness!

09:17.490 --> 09:20.186
Why don't you just give him
a big chocolate Easter bunny?

09:22.161 --> 09:25.187
Yeah! That'll work.

09:25.231 --> 09:29.725
I said, why don't you just
give him a big chocolate...

09:29.769 --> 09:33.205
Look, what am I supposed
to do here with this?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.639
I know. You were asleep.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.074
- He broke in.
- Meatwad!

09:37.109 --> 09:39.441
He flipped a switch,
bad wiring lights him on fire.

09:39.478 --> 09:40.570
Don't listen to him.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.274
No one knows he's down here.
Come on.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.748
I don't like the way this
T- shirt is making you act!

09:43.783 --> 09:45.717
Oh, is that right?
You got a mind to rat me out?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.116
No, no, no, no, Meatwad.
Nothing like that.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.984
Please, look...
you've got that T-shirt on.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.682
Just... just do something,
will you?

09:50.723 --> 09:52.691
OK, OK, OK.
Just look... let me...

09:52.725 --> 09:55.091
let me concentrate here
for a second.

09:55.127 --> 09:58.119
Oh, boy! A new unicycle!

09:59.865 --> 10:01.799
Oh, man, lookin' good!

10:01.834 --> 10:04.302
The elves kind of whipped it up
for me at the last minute.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.464
You gonna be able to do
this yourself next year.

10:06.505 --> 10:08.973
You'll be bouncing around in
no time, ol' Soccer Claus...

10:09.008 --> 10:11.602
Santa Claus.
Santa Claus is what I said.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.271
It's important that
I don't leave this tent...

10:13.312 --> 10:16.713
until the graft fully
takes hold to my muscles...

10:16.749 --> 10:19.445
because this is my skin now.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.646
Oh, God!

10:21.687 --> 10:24.053
It's OK. It's OK, Santa.
Just take your time.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.455
OK. OK.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.083
Remember, we do have
a lot of houses to go through.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.526
- So, whenever you're ready...
- Oh, yeah. Oh.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.690
I can't see too well
with the soccer ball lids.

10:32.732 --> 10:33.960
Take it easy. It's OK.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.628
But I think that
this is Jeffy's place.

10:36.669 --> 10:40.730
And if I remember correctly,
he wants a wooden train.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.832
Great! Did you hear that,
Meatwad?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.105
Yep. Here it is. His very own...

10:45.144 --> 10:46.543
wooden brain.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.944
Train, you idiot! Train!

10:47.980 --> 10:49.208
Don't you talk ugly to me.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.716
I mean, I'll send you
to the moon with my magic shirt.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.116
Yeah, I know, master.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.915
Jeffy's just gonna have to
bite the bullet on this one...

10:54.954 --> 10:56.444
'cause it has been
a long night...

10:56.489 --> 10:58.923
and we ain't even done
the eastern seaboard yet.

10:59.025 --> 11:02.051
Just give it to him.
He's not a... not a bright child.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.288
Can I ask a question, master?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.820
You... you said we would be
trading off at some point.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.025
Is that close?

11:07.066 --> 11:09.534
We gonna finish up America,
then we do Europe...

11:09.568 --> 11:11.399
then you knock out
the Middle East yourself.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.268
- ... you!
- Cry me a river, bitch.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.432
Dancing is forbidden

11:15.474 --> 11:18.739
Dancing is forbidden

11:18.778 --> 11:21.008
Dancing is forbidden

11:21.047 --> 11:23.948
Dancing is forbidden

11:23.983 --> 11:25.814
Dancing is forbidden
