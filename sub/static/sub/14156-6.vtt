13:42.489 --> 13:43.323
I ALREADY SEE HER.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.592
HELLO, TAYLOR.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.960
>> OH, KEISHA.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.095
HOW ARE YOU?

13:48.095 --> 13:49.196
THAT'S NICE.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.497
SHOW ME COCKTAIL DRESSES.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.631
MALCOLM AND I WILL BE DOING SOME

13:51.631 --> 13:53.566
ENTERTAINING AFTER I REDECORATE.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.567
>> PLEASE DON'T TELL ME SHE CAME

13:54.567 --> 13:55.602
ALL THE WAY TO MY BACKYARD

13:55.602 --> 13:58.038
JUST TO PLAY "BITCH."

13:58.038 --> 13:59.139
>> SHE'S GOOD THOUGH.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.640
BETTE DAVIS, JOAN CRAWFORD

14:00.640 --> 14:01.308
GOOD.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.143
I SHOULD BE TAKING NOTES.

14:03.143 --> 14:03.676
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A

14:03.676 --> 14:05.245
SCENE, ARE YOU?

14:05.245 --> 14:06.346
>> PLEASE, I WOULD NEVER GIVE

14:06.346 --> 14:07.514
HER THE SATISFACTION.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.049
BESIDES, THAT WOULD BE A VERY

14:09.049 --> 14:10.317
SHORT SCENE BECAUSE I WOULD--

14:10.317 --> 14:11.885
>> KEEP IT CLASSY.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.920
>> YEAH.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.621
>> THIS IS SO ME.

14:14.621 --> 14:18.058
SEXY, BUT ELEGANT.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.192
N'EST-CE PAS?

14:19.192 --> 14:19.960
>> THERE SHE GO WITH THAT

14:19.960 --> 14:20.627
FRENCH--

14:20.627 --> 14:21.294
>> EASY, GIRL.

14:21.294 --> 14:21.962
EASY.

14:21.962 --> 14:22.629
>> [laughs]

14:22.629 --> 14:23.163
>> YOU WERE DOING SO WELL.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.597
>> I'LL GO GRAB THAT PURSE FROM

14:24.597 --> 14:26.533
THE BACK I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.136
[silently]

14:29.136 --> 14:30.170
>> COULD YOU START RINGING

14:30.170 --> 14:31.071
ME UP?

14:31.071 --> 14:31.905
I'M MEETING MY BOYFRIEND FOR

14:31.905 --> 14:32.372
LUNCH.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.008
MUSTN'T BE TOO LATE.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.077
>> LOOK, TAYLOR.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.478
MALCOLM AND I DIDN'T WORK OUT.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.579
AND I'M COOL WITH THAT.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.981
BUT I STILL REGARD HIM AS A

14:40.981 --> 14:41.648
FRIEND.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.950
AND I ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR MY

14:42.950 --> 14:44.084
FRIENDS.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.618
DOES MALCOLM KNOW YOUR FAMILY

14:45.618 --> 14:46.453
IS BROKE?

14:46.453 --> 14:47.921
>> [laughs]

14:47.921 --> 14:49.289
EXCUSE ME?

14:49.289 --> 14:51.291
>> I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE

14:51.291 --> 14:53.226
HE HAS THE FULL PICTURE.

14:53.226 --> 14:58.098
CAN'T HAVE HIM GOING IN BLIND.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.200
SO IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, YOU

15:00.200 --> 15:01.068
SHOULD TELL HIM.

15:01.068 --> 15:01.969
THEN I CAN STAY OUT OF YOUR

15:01.969 --> 15:02.970
BUSINESS.

15:02.970 --> 15:07.407
OTHERWISE, HAVE A GOOD DAY.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.211
>> WHAT SHE SAID.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.688
>> I HAVE A CONFESSION.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.523
WHEN YOU OFFERED TO COOK, I

15:23.523 --> 15:25.092
DIDN'T EXPECT VEGAN.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.359
>> WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.061
TWINKIES AND JUICE BOXES?

15:28.061 --> 15:28.661
>> [laughs]

15:28.661 --> 15:30.263
>> I MAY BE YOUNG, BUT I HAVE

15:30.263 --> 15:31.664
A VERY MATURE PALATE.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.600
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH, PLEASE.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.601
>> I'LL ADMIT IT.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.435
YOU'RE NOT THE AVERAGE

15:35.435 --> 15:36.603
20-YEAR-OLD.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.470
>> THANK YOU.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.239
AND I KNOW THAT WAS HARD FOR YOU

15:39.239 --> 15:42.475
TO SAY.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.444
>> THIS ISN'T WEIRD FOR YOU?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.313
>> I CAN'T FRONT.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.614
I MEAN, SOMETIMES I DO FEEL

15:47.614 --> 15:49.249
OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.418
BUT YOU, YOUR SPIRIT--

15:51.418 --> 15:53.353
IT'S LIKE MAGNETIC, BUT GENTLE

15:53.353 --> 15:54.254
TOO.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.723
IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.391
>> I DON'T KNOW.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.626
IT SOUNDED GOOD.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.593
>> ALL I MEAN IS YOU MAKE ME

16:00.593 --> 16:04.131
LESS AFRAID TO--

16:04.131 --> 16:05.465
I'M SORRY.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.435
>> SHH.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.775
[door closes]

16:15.775 --> 16:16.676
>> WHOOPS.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.711
MY BAD, ROOMIE.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.047
I MUST HAVE MISSED THE SOCK ON

16:20.047 --> 16:20.780
THE DOOR.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.050
>> KEISHA, THIS IS SCOTTY.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.051
>> HI.

16:24.051 --> 16:24.784
DON'T MIND ME.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.785
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

16:25.785 --> 16:29.656
AND I'LL HAVE ON HEADPHONES.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.790
>> WANT TO GO TO MY PLACE?

16:30.790 --> 16:32.092
I MEAN, MY ROOMMATE'S AT HIS

16:32.092 --> 16:34.161
GIRLFRIEND'S DORM.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.529
>> UM, THANKS.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.665
BUT I DO REALLY HAVE TO GET UP

16:38.665 --> 16:40.100
EARLY.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.668
LET'S JUST CALL IT A NIGHT.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.602
>> BUT WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD

16:42.602 --> 16:44.371
DESSERT.

16:44.371 --> 16:48.475
>> RAIN CHECK?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.810
>> SURE.

16:50.810 --> 16:51.811
SO I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW?

16:51.811 --> 16:52.545
>> MM-HMM.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.515
>> ALL RIGHT.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.521
>> IS THE COAST CLEAR?

17:01.521 --> 17:02.555
OR DID HE RUN OUT TO GET SOME

17:02.555 --> 17:03.390
CONDOMS?

17:03.390 --> 17:04.057
>> SHUT UP.

17:04.057 --> 17:04.524
>> [laughs]

17:04.524 --> 17:05.425
NO, FOR REAL.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.527
DID YOU TAKE YOUR PILL TODAY?

17:07.527 --> 17:08.528
>> [giggles] SHUT UP.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.697
>> YOU ARE ROBBING THE CRADLE.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.065
MY NEXT CALL IS TO CHILD

17:12.065 --> 17:13.500
PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.434
>> [sighs]

17:14.434 --> 17:16.169
I KNOW.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.470
THAT'S WHY I MADE HIM LEAVE.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.438
>> OH, STOP.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.472
I'M JUST PLAYING.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.707
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT YOURS.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.441
I WOULD'VE.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.175
HE WAS CUTE.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.176
>> I DON'T KNOW.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.777
IT FEELS SO INAPPROPRIATE.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.146
>> WELL, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW HOW

17:26.146 --> 17:26.646
IT FEELS?

17:26.646 --> 17:31.518
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.719
>> TRUE.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.293
>> THANKS.

17:40.293 --> 17:40.760
MMM.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.295
>> MMM.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.097
>> OOH, LOOK, RAQUEL.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.132
YOU AND SCOTTY CAN GO TO SIX

17:45.132 --> 17:45.798
FLAGS.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.335
"CHILDREN UNDER 17 HALF PRICE

17:48.335 --> 17:49.569
WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN ADULT."

17:49.569 --> 17:51.238
>> OH, KEISHA, YOU ARE NOT

17:51.238 --> 17:51.804
RIGHT.

17:51.804 --> 17:52.705
[laughs]

17:52.705 --> 17:54.274
>> AM I WRONG FOR LIKING A MAN

17:54.274 --> 17:56.609
WHO'S AMBITIOUS, CONFIDENT,

17:56.609 --> 17:58.145
INSIGHTFUL, SEXY?

17:58.145 --> 17:59.846
>> HE'S A BOY, AND HE'S 12.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.314
>> WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T

18:01.314 --> 18:02.882
TRIED DATING AGE-APPROPRIATE

18:02.882 --> 18:03.783
MEN.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.352
I CALLED THAT GUY CHARLES FROM

18:05.352 --> 18:06.553
THE BOULE BALL TWICE.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.854
BUT HE NEVER CALLED ME BACK.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.222
SO IN THE MEANTIME, WHY CAN'T

18:09.222 --> 18:11.158
I EXPLORE ALL OF MY OPTIONS?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.725
>> JUSTIFIED, GIRL.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.593
>> [laughs]

18:13.593 --> 18:14.261
>> PREACH.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.428
>> BESIDES, DATING YOUNGER IS

18:15.428 --> 18:16.596
NOT ALL THAT UNCOMMON THESE

18:16.596 --> 18:17.430
DAYS.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.499
LOOK AT DEMI MOORE.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.700
CHER, MADONNA?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.734
MARIAH.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.270
>> IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.271
IF YOU WANT TO QUENCH YOUR

18:24.271 --> 18:25.638
THIRST, YOU GOTTA DRINK FROM THE

18:25.638 --> 18:26.706
FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

18:26.706 --> 18:27.840
>> I DON'T KNOW, I LIKE MY GUYS

18:27.840 --> 18:29.676
MATURE, WITH MORE EXPERIENCE.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.843
THEY CAN TEACH YOU MORE THINGS.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.612
AND THEY TAKE YOU MORE PLACES.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.813
THEY'RE CONSIDERATE IN BED.

18:33.813 --> 18:34.681
>> OOH.

18:34.681 --> 18:35.615
I'VE HAD A YOUNGSTER WHO

18:35.615 --> 18:37.250
CONSIDERED ME EVERYWHERE.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.718
THE DINING ROOM TABLE,

18:38.718 --> 18:39.619
THE KITCHEN COUNTER--

18:39.619 --> 18:40.687
>> PLEASE STOP.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.622
OR I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.790
ANYWAY.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.757
I TOTALLY SEE SCOTTY FOR WHO HE

18:44.757 --> 18:46.159
IS.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.294
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, IT

18:47.294 --> 18:48.328
HITS ME THAT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH

18:48.328 --> 18:50.930
SCHOOL, HE WAS IN A HIGH CHAIR.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.799
>> OH, SO YOU NEED US TO TALK

18:52.799 --> 18:53.700
YOU INTO THIS.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.701
>> NO.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.502
NO, NO, NO.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.203
I'M INTO IT.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.337
I LIKE HIM.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.306
BUT YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES A GIRL

18:59.306 --> 19:00.407
NEEDS TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS

19:00.407 --> 19:01.608
WHEN SHE'S ROBBING THE CRADLE.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.309
>> OKAY.

19:02.309 --> 19:02.942
PROS--

19:02.942 --> 19:04.811
YOUNGER MEN ARE EASYGOING,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.179
TRAINABLE.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.714
THEY HAVE NO BAGGAGE AND PLENTY

19:07.714 --> 19:08.581
OF STAMINA.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.349
>> MM.

19:09.349 --> 19:09.816
>> CONS--

19:09.816 --> 19:11.584
THEY'RE IMMATURE, FLIGHTY,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.720
UNWORLDLY, INDECISIVE, AND

19:13.720 --> 19:14.687
IRRESPONSIBLE.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.455
>> OKAY.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.823
WELL, THAT MAY BE TRUE.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.725
YET I STILL WANT TO DATE HIM.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.927
CALL ME CRAZY BUT THAT'S THE

19:20.927 --> 19:22.195
THING ABOUT PASSION.

19:22.195 --> 19:22.895
>> WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO

19:22.895 --> 19:24.264
FOLLOW YOUR PASSION, AT LEAST

19:24.264 --> 19:25.832
MAPQUEST IT FIRST.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.833
>> WHAT?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.335
>> JUST KNOW THAT HE IS 20.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.736
AND THE ONLY THING CONSTANT

19:29.736 --> 19:30.803
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S 20 IS

19:30.803 --> 19:31.704
CHANGE.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.639
>> OH, TRUE.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.973
A MONTH FROM NOW, SCOTTY WILL BE

19:33.973 --> 19:35.475
A DIFFERENT PERSON, AND THAT

19:35.475 --> 19:36.743
PERSON MAY NO LONGER WANT TO BE

19:36.743 --> 19:37.544
WITH YOU.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.978
>> OR HE COULD BE YOUR ASHTON

19:38.978 --> 19:39.679
KUTCHER.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.680
AND THE TWO OF YOU COULD LIVE

19:40.680 --> 19:41.681
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.516
FOR AT LEAST 8 YEARS.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.418
>> SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING

19:45.418 --> 19:45.885
TO HAPPEN.

19:45.885 --> 19:46.686
I DON'T KNOW KNOW WHAT TO

19:46.686 --> 19:47.654
EXPECT.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.521
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING

19:48.521 --> 19:49.689
TO FEEL.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.790
SOUNDS LIKE EVERY OTHER

19:50.790 --> 19:51.758
RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER HAD.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.659
>> EXACTLY.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.260
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD JUST GO

19:53.260 --> 19:53.893
FOR IT.

19:53.893 --> 19:54.794
>> YEAH, TRUE.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.462
>> THANK YOU.

19:55.462 --> 19:55.928
[laughter]

19:55.928 --> 19:57.230
[cell phone rings]

19:57.230 --> 19:58.798
>> HELLO.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.968
THIS IS KEISHA GREENE.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.836
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS WHAT MY

20:03.836 --> 20:04.971
PICTURE MAKES YOU WANT TO DO.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.273
NOW DO YOU WANT TO BUY A HOUSE

20:06.273 --> 20:06.806
OR WHAT?

20:06.806 --> 20:07.740
>> [laughs]

20:07.740 --> 20:09.642
>> WELL, CALL ME WHEN YOU DO.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.310
[keypad tone]

20:10.310 --> 20:11.544
>> MORE FANS FROM YOUR AD?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.407

27:55.407 --> 27:56.408

SOME MAN TELLING ME I NEED TO

31:31.991 --> 31:33.425
STAY AWAY FROM MY NEPHEW.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.693
