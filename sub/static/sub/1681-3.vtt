00:02.570 --> 00:05.429
<i>Kids, in a fall of 2008,
I had a little problem</i>

00:05.589 --> 00:07.673
All right, I got to get to Stella's.

00:08.866 --> 00:11.582
Tonight's the night. I've tried it
before, I've failed every time.

00:11.702 --> 00:14.264
This time, I am gonna do it.
Tonight...

00:15.789 --> 00:17.479
I pick up a lesbian.

00:19.265 --> 00:20.902
Robin, I need your lipstick.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.321
Oh, man!

00:24.273 --> 00:26.673
- Take pictures, all right?
- Bye, Ted.

00:28.726 --> 00:29.703
<i>I lived in NY,</i>

00:31.232 --> 00:34.248
<i>but Stella lived across
the river, in New Jersey...</i>

00:36.228 --> 00:37.459
Oh, man!

00:40.205 --> 00:42.197
<i>...which meant I was always
taking the train.</i>

00:42.316 --> 00:44.348
- What's up, Ted?
- Hey, Matisse.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.803
- Hey, T-Diddy!
- Theodore!

00:47.963 --> 00:50.431
- You missed it.
- Robin got that national anchor job.

00:50.591 --> 00:52.661
And we got a free
bottle of champagne.

00:52.781 --> 00:54.332
But it's empty now.

00:54.452 --> 00:55.727
Oh, man!

00:56.049 --> 00:59.063
<i>And as result, it seemed like
I was missing out on everything.</i>

01:00.476 --> 01:02.524
Sorry, we couldn't wait.
It was getting cold.

01:02.685 --> 01:03.735
Oh, man!

01:03.895 --> 01:05.694
- Hey, big guy.
- What's up, G?

01:06.651 --> 01:08.849
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...

01:08.969 --> 01:11.962
You know, I want to hang out
with you guys, with my friends.

01:12.082 --> 01:14.244
I just feel like I'm spending
all my time on the train.

01:14.844 --> 01:18.225
OK, how about this, why don't you ask
your friends to come out here sometime?

01:18.345 --> 01:19.916
That's a great idea.

01:20.077 --> 01:22.920
You want us to go to New Jersey?
Oh, that is rich.

01:23.209 --> 01:25.170
- Why?
- Well, for starters,

01:25.290 --> 01:27.592
I don't have any
of my gold medallions anymore.

01:27.874 --> 01:31.093
I sold them when they went
out of style 400 years ago.

01:32.060 --> 01:33.928
- Lily?
- Oh, sorry, Ted.

01:34.048 --> 01:35.765
I'm a born and raised New Yorker.

01:35.925 --> 01:37.767
I'm programmed
to despise and loathe

01:37.927 --> 01:39.820
New Jersey and all
that it stands for.

01:39.940 --> 01:43.105
Why am I telling you this?
You hate New Jersey more than anyone.

01:43.265 --> 01:45.941
What? I don't hate New Jersey.
Why would you think that?

01:46.269 --> 01:49.444
And then he cut in front of me.
God, I hate line cutters

01:49.604 --> 01:51.614
more than I hate New Jersey.

01:52.774 --> 01:55.866
That's not true. There's nothing
I hate more than New Jersey.

02:01.072 --> 02:01.990
Right?

02:04.146 --> 02:06.977
- You want us to wait for you?
- No, I might be awhile.

02:07.097 --> 02:09.079
I got a drop a massive New Jersey.

02:10.273 --> 02:13.080
Okay, so New Jersey's
not my favorite place.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.147
But once Stella and I get married
and she and Lucy move in with me,

02:16.267 --> 02:17.972
I'll never set foot
in New Jersey again.

02:18.459 --> 02:21.466
Unless I'm going to see
a Giants game or flying out of Newark

02:21.586 --> 02:23.826
or God forbid, disposing of a body.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.205
Ted, if you murder me and
bury me in New Jersey,

02:27.325 --> 02:29.052
I'll haunt you forever.

02:29.576 --> 02:31.767
But if I murder you and
bury you somewhere else?

02:31.887 --> 02:33.405
I'll leave you alone.

02:33.524 --> 02:35.498
I'm sure you had your reasons.

<i>Kids, your Aunt Robin was sick
of her job at Metro News One.</i>

02:54.690 --> 02:56.534
<i>She was sick of the low
production value...</i>

02:56.654 --> 02:59.174
I'm Robin Scherbatsky,
and you're watching...

03:00.877 --> 03:02.796
Etro News One at 11:00.

03:04.873 --> 03:06.229
And again at 1:00.

03:07.481 --> 03:09.410
<i>...sick of the stories
she had to report...</i>

03:09.531 --> 03:11.472
So hurry up and get your votes in

03:11.592 --> 03:13.648
for New York's cutest doggie.

03:15.426 --> 03:18.111
<i>...and most of all, she was sick of
all the stupid puns.</i>

03:18.272 --> 03:22.079
Four transit workers were electrocuted
when a subway train jumped the tracks.

03:22.565 --> 03:23.983
Stay tuned for the...

03:24.484 --> 03:26.008
Shocking derails.

03:26.542 --> 03:28.204
Joel, people died.

03:30.407 --> 03:33.578
<i>So when the call came in that she got
the big national anchor job,</i>

03:33.697 --> 03:35.302
<i>she finally got to say the words</i>

03:35.421 --> 03:37.358
<i>she'd been dreaming of saying
for years...</i>

03:37.478 --> 03:39.048
<i>Tonight will be my last broadcast.</i>

03:39.609 --> 03:42.468
<i>I came to Metro News One
as a little caterpillar.</i>

03:42.790 --> 03:46.388
<i>And for four years,
this desk has been my cocoon.</i>

03:47.520 --> 03:48.515
<i>But tonight,</i>

03:48.675 --> 03:51.826
I emerge an ambitious butterfly.

03:52.261 --> 03:54.750
Why does she sound like an idiot?
Did she have a stroke?

03:54.870 --> 03:57.031
Yeah. A stroke of genius.

03:57.432 --> 03:59.485
This speech is really good.

04:00.728 --> 04:02.507
<i>With one eye on the horizon,</i>

04:03.172 --> 04:04.405
<i>one eye on the truth,</i>

04:05.238 --> 04:07.419
<i>and one eye on all of you.</i>

04:08.800 --> 04:10.328
You wrote it for her, didn't you?

04:11.546 --> 04:13.796
It's a modified version
of the speech I gave

04:13.916 --> 04:17.084
when I had to leave the swim team
`cause of a chronic inner ear situation.

04:17.319 --> 04:20.152
- I thought you were the towel boy.
- It's part of the team.

04:21.206 --> 04:23.965
<i>So that Saturday as Robin went off
for her first day at her new job,</i>

04:24.125 --> 04:26.184
<i>we all headed across the river
to experience</i>

04:26.304 --> 04:28.219
<i>some of that crazy
New Jersey nightlife.</i>

04:28.380 --> 04:31.514
Okay, Stella couldn't find a sitter,
so we can't go out. Instead...

04:32.047 --> 04:35.496
We're all gonna hang out here
and it's gonna be just as awesome.

04:35.615 --> 04:38.098
Right, we got board games,
we got movies.

04:38.218 --> 04:40.731
And I think there may be
some beer out in the garage.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.379
Ted, this is pathetic.
It's Saturday night.

04:46.498 --> 04:48.297
We should be out at a bar.
Drinking alcohol.

04:48.417 --> 04:51.491
Now I know that sounds depressing,
bordering on tragic, but it's a fact.

04:51.651 --> 04:54.097
Yeah, and I want another crack
at that chick, Doris.

04:54.217 --> 04:56.162
I know I can land
that lesbian plane.

04:56.323 --> 04:58.048
No snakes on that plane.

04:59.879 --> 05:02.121
Okay, guys. Come on, you promised.

05:02.241 --> 05:04.754
Let's just hang out here,
try to have fun.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.463
I mean, we're all together,

05:06.811 --> 05:09.133
friends hanging out.
Isn't that what really matters?

05:14.464 --> 05:16.849
If we take the next train,
we can be at MacLaren's by 11:00.

05:16.969 --> 05:19.143
- We can be there by 10:00.
- No, I have to change first.

05:19.303 --> 05:21.994
I'm not walking into MacLaren's
smelling like New Jersey.

05:25.906 --> 05:27.860
You guys really hate it here?

05:28.230 --> 05:29.983
What? No!

05:30.103 --> 05:31.131
Stels...

05:31.607 --> 05:34.867
I get it, you guys are New Yorkers.
You need to go hang out at a bar.

05:35.173 --> 05:38.086
Well, you could just hang out
at the coolest bar in the state,

05:38.206 --> 05:40.559
which is so close
it will blow your mind.

05:42.742 --> 05:46.210
And boom goes the dynamite.
The coolest bar in New Jersey.

05:46.818 --> 05:48.004
Yeah, it probably is.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.990
This is great!

05:50.497 --> 05:53.760
We got darts.
Half a ping-pong table.

05:54.056 --> 05:55.177
A fish bowl.

05:55.527 --> 05:58.096
Look what turned out to be
an awesome night as promised.

05:58.477 --> 06:01.224
Maybe we can drop some
Bac-O's in here and make them fight.

06:01.384 --> 06:03.386
No, thanks. I don't mess
with fish bowls unless

06:03.506 --> 06:08.030
they have my two favorite fish:
the sucker fish and the blow fish.

06:08.151 --> 06:09.182
What up!

06:10.079 --> 06:12.401
For "blow fish"? I don't think so.

06:14.894 --> 06:16.780
Marshall. You're better than that.

06:18.192 --> 06:19.492
Not good enough.

06:24.007 --> 06:24.955
Sorry.

06:26.312 --> 06:29.751
I am not lowering this until
someone gives me the respect

06:29.911 --> 06:33.108
of another person's knuckles
tapping against mine

06:33.228 --> 06:35.423
in a light but decisive manner.

06:37.127 --> 06:38.389
Pretty, pretty...

06:38.508 --> 06:40.803
Pretty, pretty...
Who's a pretty baby?

06:43.006 --> 06:46.141
Then know this...
Until it gets what it wants,

06:46.301 --> 06:47.839
nay, deserves,

06:48.889 --> 06:51.464
this fist will not yield.

06:52.907 --> 06:54.499
It will

06:54.910 --> 06:55.696
not

06:56.334 --> 06:57.175
yield.

06:58.701 --> 07:01.059
- So who wants to play Scrabble?
- Sure, whatever.

07:01.495 --> 07:03.916
Heads up, the "X" tile
is a little hard to read

07:04.036 --> 07:07.036
because a couple years ago,
it went all the way through my dog.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.582
You know, maybe we should get
a dog again when you move in.

07:12.117 --> 07:13.251
When I what?

07:13.706 --> 07:15.512
Oh, great. There's Robin.

07:21.454 --> 07:23.260
I thought they were
moving in with you.

07:23.672 --> 07:24.757
So did I.

07:26.833 --> 07:29.558
God, am I moving to New Jersey?

07:30.407 --> 07:33.076
Hey, guys, I bet that dog was
really flying high

07:33.196 --> 07:35.105
after it swallowed a little "X."

07:35.595 --> 07:36.746
Nailed it!

07:38.726 --> 07:39.757
Come on!

07:43.770 --> 07:45.072
I can't live here.

07:45.558 --> 07:47.113
It wouldn't be that bad.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.202
You could put a mini-fridge over there
and maybe some knock hockey.

07:50.361 --> 07:52.413
Knock hockey. Nice one, Big Mon.

07:53.171 --> 07:56.041
I meant New Jersey in general,
not this basement.

07:56.368 --> 07:58.623
She wants me to move here?
I don't get it.

07:58.742 --> 08:00.128
We discussed this months ago.

08:00.794 --> 08:03.327
So I was thinking
after the wedding,

08:03.998 --> 08:05.920
you and Lucy could move in here.

08:07.489 --> 08:09.761
Yeah, she could play out
on the fire escape,

08:10.044 --> 08:12.682
maybe make friends with that guy
who sleeps on that couch in the alley,

08:12.842 --> 08:14.649
ride her bike up and down Broadway.

08:14.769 --> 08:16.685
It's a great idea, Ted.

08:19.277 --> 08:22.006
I don't understand why you'd
want to live in New Jersey

08:22.126 --> 08:23.928
when you have a chance
to live in Manhattan?

08:24.048 --> 08:26.413
I thought having a rent-controlled
apartment on the West Side

08:26.534 --> 08:28.039
was why she agreed to marry me.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.573
Really, I thought it was
the whole reason. What is up?

08:33.736 --> 08:34.956
Looking good.

08:35.244 --> 08:38.121
- Bump the Barnacle.
- Stella already told me not to.

08:38.412 --> 08:40.365
- How was your first day?
- It wasn't.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.246
- What?
- It wasn't my first day.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.507
I showed up and there
were 20 other people.

08:44.627 --> 08:46.415
It turns out,
I didn't actually get the job.

08:46.535 --> 08:47.965
I only got an audition.

08:48.124 --> 08:49.742
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.260
He told me that I got it.

08:51.750 --> 08:52.716
I got it?

08:52.977 --> 08:53.894
I got it!

08:54.750 --> 08:57.088
<i>And just to be clear,
when I say "you got it,"</i>

08:57.207 --> 08:58.881
<i>I mean an audition.</i>

09:00.016 --> 09:01.403
<i>You got an audition.</i>

09:01.669 --> 09:03.443
<i>I don't want there to be
any confusion.</i>

09:03.563 --> 09:05.675
<i>You have an audition only.</i>

09:06.229 --> 09:07.496
<i>Not the job.</i>

09:09.220 --> 09:10.528
Thank you! Thank you!

09:11.556 --> 09:14.274
OK, I'm going to call and beg
Joel to give me my job back.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.368
- You hated that job.
- I don't konw, it wasn't so bad.

09:17.620 --> 09:20.025
What did they make you
call Tropical Storm Hector

09:20.145 --> 09:22.140
when it was raining cats and dogs?

09:22.548 --> 09:23.832
A furricane.

09:24.191 --> 09:25.667
Hey, Ted.

09:26.177 --> 09:28.117
- Rock me like a furricane.
- Thanks.

09:29.464 --> 09:30.361
Mean.

09:30.998 --> 09:34.634
Okay,  it sucks, but what can I do?
I'm not going to get that other job.

09:34.857 --> 09:37.048
You should have seen
the other women at this audition.

09:37.168 --> 09:40.227
They all had more experience
than me, were more ethnic than me.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.964
There was an African-American
chick with blue eyes,

09:43.084 --> 09:45.894
- how can I compete with that?
- you can't.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.213
No, you can compete with anyone.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.924
You're Robin Scherbatsky.

09:50.044 --> 09:52.132
Confident, strong, tall,

09:52.253 --> 09:54.778
with crazy long legs
that look great in shorts.

09:55.059 --> 09:56.396
I'm calling Joel.

09:56.516 --> 09:59.700
No, if you call him right now,
you will hate yourself.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.035
Look, I have slept
with lots of women

10:02.155 --> 10:04.120
who afterwards told me off
and stormed out.

10:04.586 --> 10:06.648
And sometimes,
they'd pick up the phone

10:06.768 --> 10:09.370
and they'd call me
and then we'd hook up again.

10:09.490 --> 10:12.420
And when we were finished,
I could see that look on their faces,

10:12.540 --> 10:14.941
that look that says
they hate themselves

10:15.062 --> 10:17.024
and they wish they'd never called.

10:17.793 --> 10:20.758
But if you could see that look...
Actually, you can see that look,

10:20.877 --> 10:22.804
there's a video, www...

10:22.965 --> 10:24.514
Stop, okay?
I won't call.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.230
Don't drink the beer!
I just remembered when I bought it.

10:28.349 --> 10:30.226
It was right before
I got pregnant with Lucy.

10:30.722 --> 10:32.918
Would you mind running
to PriceCo and picking some up?

10:33.038 --> 10:35.155
While you're there,
maybe you could sign up for a card.

10:35.275 --> 10:37.555
You'll probably end up
going there all the time.

10:40.304 --> 10:41.573
That's the look.

10:44.084 --> 10:45.576
I can't move here.

10:45.737 --> 10:47.821
I hate it here.
I would kill myself.

10:47.941 --> 10:51.358
Maybe New Jersey's not that bad.
Stella has a lawn.

10:51.478 --> 10:54.065
You could get a riding lawn mower.
They sell them over there.

10:54.185 --> 10:55.757
I saw one with a cup holder.

10:55.877 --> 10:58.088
I saw a recliner with
a built-in cup holder.

10:58.249 --> 11:00.029
I even saw a hammock
with a cup holder.

11:00.148 --> 11:02.675
You live in New Jersey,
you never have to hold a cup again.

11:02.835 --> 11:04.970
I don't have as big a problem
holding cups as you do.

11:05.697 --> 11:06.869
I will give you

11:06.989 --> 11:09.223
$100 to fist pump me.

11:11.635 --> 11:12.506
$200.

11:13.344 --> 11:16.773
Just put it down, Barney.
Your arm must be killing you by now.

11:19.092 --> 11:20.367
$10,000.

11:21.905 --> 11:24.446
You'll be right across the river.
You'll be in New York all the time.

11:26.701 --> 11:27.602
Excuse me.

11:27.722 --> 11:30.118
- You guys are from New York?
- We moved here from Manhattan.

11:30.617 --> 11:32.745
- Do you ever get into the city?
- All the time.

11:33.053 --> 11:35.372
- See? All the time.
- When was the last time ?

11:35.732 --> 11:37.626
We just had dinner at O'Rourke's.

11:37.785 --> 11:39.543
That's been closed for six years.

11:39.819 --> 11:42.536
It has been awhile.
Funny, we don't miss it.

11:42.883 --> 11:44.840
I guess we're New Jersey-ians now.

11:45.273 --> 11:47.069
Honey, look, dog shirts.

11:49.444 --> 11:51.388
I can't do it.
I'm just going to tell Stella

11:51.548 --> 11:54.038
she and Lucy have to move
into the city and that's that.

11:54.343 --> 11:55.851
What do you guys think?

11:56.376 --> 11:58.521
Beagle or Boston terrier?

12:02.350 --> 12:03.983
Are those tears?

12:05.578 --> 12:07.042
They're awesome...

12:07.163 --> 12:09.488
manly pain tears.
They're not emotional.

12:11.155 --> 12:13.010
They're a little bit emotional.

12:14.566 --> 12:15.752
Where's Robin?

12:19.773 --> 12:22.000
Hey, Shirley,
it's Robin calling for Joel.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.169
Robin, hang up the phone.
Don't do this.

12:24.424 --> 12:25.796
Sorry, I know, okay?

12:25.956 --> 12:27.840
- If you don't hang up right now...
- Stop.

12:28.183 --> 12:30.342
Hey, Joel, it's Robin.

12:30.514 --> 12:33.302
So Madam Butterfly wants
to come back to the cocoon.

12:34.444 --> 12:36.472
I'm sorry I said all that stuff.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.684
You can stick your sorries
in your sock drawer,

12:38.843 --> 12:41.775
'cause you've already been replaced.
I've got Brian in makeup

12:41.895 --> 12:43.521
and he couldn't be more excited.

12:43.681 --> 12:45.898
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

12:46.735 --> 12:49.352
Okay, look, as much as
I want to see college boy here

12:49.472 --> 12:52.041
wet himself on camera,
if you can get here in time

12:52.160 --> 12:54.448
to read the 11:00 news,
you can have your old job back.

12:55.559 --> 12:58.195
Okay, I have a half hour
to make it to the studio.

12:58.315 --> 13:00.539
There's no way you can make it
to the city in a half hour.

13:00.659 --> 13:03.179
Don't do this. I know it's scary
to bet on yourself,

13:03.299 --> 13:06.702
but if you don't, nobody else will.
I'm not saying that to get a fist bump.

13:06.822 --> 13:09.337
Although, come on, a fist bump
would be great. But I really mean it.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.195
I am betting on myself. I am betting
that I can make it there by 11:00.

13:29.155 --> 13:32.483
- Hey, did you get the beer?
- Yeah, I got 144-pack.

13:32.643 --> 13:34.242
The rest is in the trunk.

13:34.535 --> 13:36.356
And did you sign up
for the membership?

13:38.305 --> 13:40.216
- Why not?
- There was a line for the photos,

13:40.336 --> 13:43.160
my hair's a mess... I don't want
to move to New Jersey.

13:44.303 --> 13:45.169
What?

13:45.289 --> 13:46.253
I can't do it.

13:46.373 --> 13:49.166
And I can't see any reason why you
and Lucy shouldn't move to New York.

13:49.808 --> 13:52.986
My daughter goes to school here.
All of her friends are here.

13:53.107 --> 13:55.214
I've lived here my whole life.
My whole family is here.

13:55.374 --> 13:58.394
This is my house. I'm on the PTA.
And as of June 1,

13:58.514 --> 13:59.842
I'm the deputy mayor.

14:01.342 --> 14:04.595
Yes, but my apartment
is really close to the subway.

14:07.384 --> 14:09.018
We're not moving, end of discussion.

14:09.178 --> 14:12.104
How can it be end of discussion
if there's never been a discussion?

14:12.396 --> 14:15.107
This is part of being a parent.
I can't just uproot Lucy.

14:15.267 --> 14:17.631
People with kids move all the time.

14:17.889 --> 14:21.030
It would be great for Lucy to grow up
in the greatest city in the world.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.870
Here we go. New York's the greatest city
in the whole wide world.

14:23.990 --> 14:26.730
It's where dreams come true
and pigeon poop tastes like tapioca.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.250
Want to know a little secret?
New Jersey...

14:29.767 --> 14:31.187
is better than New York.

14:31.699 --> 14:32.790
Better than...?

14:32.910 --> 14:34.236
You think...? I...

14:35.155 --> 14:36.858
The Empire State Buil...

14:37.372 --> 14:38.534
H and H Bage...

14:39.040 --> 14:40.754
Lincoln Ce... Zabar's...

14:41.404 --> 14:42.883
Papaya King.

14:43.497 --> 14:46.178
New York is the intellectual
and cultural hub of the planet.

14:47.047 --> 14:49.060
New York is full of weirdoes,

14:49.179 --> 14:52.066
and snobs and mean people.
Do you know that once, an old lady

14:52.186 --> 14:54.520
actually called me a bitch
and threw a cat in my face?

14:54.921 --> 14:57.416
And you want to know
if that happened in New Jersey?

14:57.535 --> 15:00.888
86th and Lex, right in front
of your beloved little Papaya King.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.562
People are nice in New Jersey.

15:03.682 --> 15:05.739
It's the kind of place
where you know your neighbors.

15:05.898 --> 15:07.740
Hey, I know my neighbors.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.940
Yeah? Like who?
Right across the hall, I got...

15:11.060 --> 15:13.162
Clax... pa... mon...

15:13.322 --> 15:15.080
- Claxpamon?
- His name is Paxton.

15:15.599 --> 15:16.819
Love that dude.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.419
Sorry, in a hurry. Got to get
to the front. Got to get off first.

15:21.539 --> 15:23.151
Don't run over Matisse.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.068
Okay, this is crazy.

15:25.187 --> 15:28.593
You can't actually think
that New Jersey is better than New York.

15:29.099 --> 15:31.588
New York has Broadway.
We win right there.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.531
No, she did not.

15:33.651 --> 15:35.128
Knuckle up for safety.

15:35.594 --> 15:37.852
- We have Atlantic City.
- Can't beat the A.C.

15:38.012 --> 15:40.066
Pretty please?
No one has to know.

15:40.425 --> 15:43.149
- New York has Greenwich Village.
- New Jersey has The Shore.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.110
Oscar-winning chronicler
of urban neuroses.

15:47.230 --> 15:48.252
Bump it!

15:48.606 --> 15:50.364
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Sinatra.

15:50.524 --> 15:52.782
He's from Hoboken... New Jersey.

15:52.943 --> 15:54.879
But what city is he singing about?

15:54.999 --> 15:56.953
It's not "Secaucus, Secaucus."

16:05.079 --> 16:07.577
<i>Now you kids can either
believe this or not,</i>

16:07.697 --> 16:10.467
<i>but this is how your Aunt Robin
swears it happened.</i>

16:16.716 --> 16:20.247
Look, Stella, I understand
that coming from New Jersey

16:20.367 --> 16:22.644
you don't picture
yourself loving New York,

16:22.804 --> 16:25.271
but trust me,
Marshall didn't expect to,

16:25.432 --> 16:28.108
and now he wouldn't think
of living anywhere else.

16:28.268 --> 16:29.318
I hate New York!

16:30.588 --> 16:32.146
I'm sorry, but it's true.

16:32.266 --> 16:34.339
Today I was walking around PriceCo.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.253
Have you ever been there?
It's huge.

16:36.373 --> 16:38.750
All the stores in New York
are so cramped. Every time I turn,

16:38.870 --> 16:41.293
I knock something over.
I'm like some huge monster

16:41.413 --> 16:43.414
that came out of the ocean
to destroy bodegas.

16:43.574 --> 16:47.151
- But, Marshall, you love New York.
- I do, except that I hate it.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.503
I'm too big for New York.

16:50.374 --> 16:52.756
I'm always trying to fit into
cramped little subway seats

16:52.875 --> 16:55.634
or duck under doorways
that were built 150 years ago.

16:55.794 --> 16:58.213
Guess what? People are bigger now.
Build bigger doorways.

16:58.333 --> 17:01.328
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Small city, big man, give it up.

17:01.841 --> 17:04.111
It's so loud, all the time.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.672
Yes, it's the city that never sleeps.
Guess what, I like to sleep.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.906
I've been tired for eight years.

17:10.028 --> 17:12.738
Tired and scared with black
and blue marks on my elbows

17:12.858 --> 17:15.251
from trying to fit through
all these tiny elf doorways.

17:15.371 --> 17:16.846
New Jersey's great.

17:17.065 --> 17:18.614
It's got huge stores,

17:18.773 --> 17:21.505
and lawns and you never have
to carry a cup again.

17:21.938 --> 17:25.412
Not for the rest of your life.
I'm not afraid to say it...

17:25.862 --> 17:27.493
I love New Jersey.

17:30.334 --> 17:31.543
I'm just kidding.

17:36.259 --> 17:37.632
I get it, okay?

17:38.479 --> 17:40.064
I see what you're saying.

17:40.370 --> 17:41.378
I guess...

17:43.725 --> 17:45.098
we could live in Brooklyn.

17:46.884 --> 17:48.362
You know what, Ted...

17:48.934 --> 17:51.177
live wherever you want.
I don't care.

17:59.521 --> 18:01.446
Awkward silence. Tap it.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.669
What are you doing up?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.790
There was some loud noises
in the basement.

18:18.986 --> 18:20.293
Sorry about that.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.756
- Why don't you got back to bed?
- I can't go to sleep without a story.

18:24.235 --> 18:27.012
- Okay, I'll just get your mom...
- Why don't you read it to me?

18:30.353 --> 18:31.353
Come on.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.772
I'm moving here.

19:04.062 --> 19:05.089
Really?

19:05.518 --> 19:06.519
Really.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.635
New Jersey wins.

19:29.107 --> 19:30.355
Oh, thank you!

19:32.170 --> 19:33.180
Wait.

19:44.453 --> 19:45.868
Good evening, New York.

19:45.987 --> 19:47.880
Hey, look, she made it.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.290
Our top story tonight,

19:49.411 --> 19:52.976
the newborn panda at the Central Park
Zoo got its first tooth today.

19:53.096 --> 19:54.831
I guess that makes her a...

19:55.947 --> 19:57.074
molar bear.

19:58.636 --> 19:59.740
Molar bear.

20:00.939 --> 20:02.006
Molar bear.

20:04.029 --> 20:06.413
You know what?
I really am done.

20:07.223 --> 20:08.667
Good night, New York.

20:13.929 --> 20:15.151
She really quit.

20:15.761 --> 20:17.992
You think we had anything
to do with that?

20:19.263 --> 20:20.495
I think we did.

20:22.162 --> 20:23.560
Nice job, Barney.

20:25.009 --> 20:26.615
Oh, my God!

20:27.239 --> 20:29.650
Thank you!

20:30.147 --> 20:32.171
Oh, that was killing my arm.

20:32.746 --> 20:35.319
My arm hasn't been this sore
since I was 13 years old

20:35.439 --> 20:38.284
and figured out how to lock a bathroom.
Up top!

20:48.222 --> 20:51.231
- What's wrong?
- I officially didn't get that job.

20:51.958 --> 20:53.827
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

20:54.865 --> 20:57.108
- They offered me another one.
- That's great.

20:57.228 --> 21:00.018
- What are you going to be doing?
- Foreign correspondent.

21:00.138 --> 21:01.139
I'm...

21:01.550 --> 21:02.783
moving to Japan.
