00:13.440 --> 00:15.249
Not my son!

00:28.920 --> 00:30.365
Wake His Lordship.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.762
The unspeakable has happened.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.775
We must speak of it immediately!

00:36.440 --> 00:38.920
What is it, Snatcher?

00:39.360 --> 00:42.695
Boxtroll monsters
have stolen a child!

00:42.720 --> 00:44.609
No!

00:44.760 --> 00:46.135
They're no doubt
picking their teeth

00:46.160 --> 00:50.131
with his adorable
baby bones by now.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.403
Horrible tragedy.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.604
Let's deal with it
in the morning.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.807
Stop! That's not
the worst of it.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.088
Next they'll come after

01:02.320 --> 01:04.846
our cheeses!

01:05.160 --> 01:06.161
My Gouda?

01:06.560 --> 01:09.769
They'll stop at nothing.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.055
You're the town exterminator.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.206
I'll pay whatever it takes.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.087
I don't want money.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.808
I want one of those.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.211
A white hat?
You? Absurd!

01:23.520 --> 01:24.521
All right, then.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.650
But prepare to say
"Bye-bye" to your Brie,

01:27.800 --> 01:31.486
"Cheerio" to your cheddar,
"Goodbye" to your...

01:31.640 --> 01:32.766
Very well!

01:32.920 --> 01:34.455
Every boxtroll gone.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.561
With proof.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.729
For a white hat?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.655
I will destroy every last
boxtroll in this town!

01:51.120 --> 01:55.489
<i>Hear ye, hear ye!</i>

01:55.760 --> 01:58.015
<i>Good citizens of Cheesebridge,</i>

01:58.040 --> 02:00.486
<i>the curfew is in force.</i>

02:00.760 --> 02:02.285
<i>Don't dawdle,</i>

02:03.160 --> 02:05.855
<i>or the beasts will
tear you limb from limb.</i>

02:05.880 --> 02:09.535
<i>They will add your flesh
to their rivers of blood,</i>

02:09.560 --> 02:11.847
<i>and mountains of bones.</i>

02:12.160 --> 02:14.120
- Let's go!
- The curfew is on!

02:14.240 --> 02:15.935
Child!

02:15.960 --> 02:18.015
Do you want to end up
like the Trubshaw baby?

02:18.040 --> 02:19.695
Dragged underground
and feasted upon

02:19.720 --> 02:21.643
one year ago this very night!

02:22.320 --> 02:24.971
<i>Lock your windows,
bolt your doors.</i>

02:25.080 --> 02:28.004
<i>Hide anything that
is not bolted down.</i>

02:28.320 --> 02:31.244
<i>Hide your cheese.</i>

02:31.480 --> 02:36.407
<i>Hide your tender
and delicious babies.</i>

02:37.120 --> 02:39.600
<i>Beware
the bloodthirsty monsters.</i>

02:39.920 --> 02:42.526
<i>They'll fry your eyes,</i>

02:42.800 --> 02:44.768
<i>gnaw on your knees,</i>

02:45.000 --> 02:48.243
<i>gobble your gizzards.</i>

02:48.560 --> 02:50.722
<i>Beware!</i>

03:05.280 --> 03:06.327
Let's go.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.446
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.720
Yeah!

04:59.640 --> 05:01.722
Give me that! A-ha!

05:59.640 --> 06:01.244
Gentlemen!

06:02.280 --> 06:07.525
Look at all these boxes
left lying about.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.647
How curious, how peculiar.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.202
I do believe evil is afoot.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.286
"Foot"

06:23.720 --> 06:26.121
You ever seen someone's
foot be evil, Mr. Trout?

06:26.440 --> 06:30.445
I believe the boss meant "evil
is nearby," Mr. Pickles.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.166
My foot had a pretty
nasty bunion once.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.084
But I wouldn't say
the foot itself was evil.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.483
No, no. It's just
a fancy word for "vicinity."

06:39.040 --> 06:42.681
Wrinkly old bunion looked like my grandma.
Had to saw her off.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.120
The bunion, not my grandma.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.966
No, no, it was a metaphor.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.441
Like how Macbeth couldn't feel the dagger...
Foot!

06:49.640 --> 06:51.927
There's one. Come on,
you squirmy monster.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.322
Your days of evil-doing are over.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.323
Boom!

06:58.560 --> 07:00.215
You really think these boxtrolls

07:00.240 --> 07:02.607
understand the duality
of good and evil?

07:02.760 --> 07:03.761
They must, right?

07:03.920 --> 07:05.445
- Why else would they hide from us?
- Nice!

07:05.600 --> 07:07.375
We are the good guys.
Nice!

07:09.840 --> 07:12.335
Yeah. Yeah,
I suppose we are.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.335
Foot!

07:19.360 --> 07:20.655
Mr. Gristle!

07:20.680 --> 07:22.170
Acquire them.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.335
Acquire. Acquire!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.365
Acquire!

07:29.080 --> 07:31.606
Come back and let me hit you!

08:30.400 --> 08:31.606
Eggs!

08:32.080 --> 08:33.335
Eggs!

08:34.559 --> 08:36.767
You see Eggs?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.080
Eggs?

09:10.600 --> 09:11.647
Eggs?

09:25.560 --> 09:27.483
Eggs.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.201
Eggs?

09:41.040 --> 09:42.087
Eggs!

09:43.000 --> 09:44.001
He's up there!

09:51.160 --> 09:52.571
Eggs?

10:01.640 --> 10:02.641
Fish.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.086
Eggs.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.328
Fish.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.607
Wake up!

13:39.560 --> 13:40.686
Missed me. Ha!

14:25.400 --> 14:26.935
Another villain off the streets.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.886
Wheels!

14:30.200 --> 14:31.247
What?

14:31.360 --> 14:32.964
Hide.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.321
This way.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.335
Shoe, come on!

15:59.120 --> 16:00.167
Boxtrolls!

16:01.920 --> 16:04.526
They could come eat my
face off at any moment.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.329
I better warn Father.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.563
Settle down, men, settle down.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.371
Important town
business to discuss.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.161
First on the docket, more
complaints of crumbling bridges.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.890
Speaking of crumbling,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.368
is that a new blue cheese I see?

16:31.520 --> 16:32.601
Does smell delicious.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.280
Well, I suppose we could
do with a nibble first.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.086
Pungent.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.971
Complex.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.015
I'm tasting notes of plum!

16:46.320 --> 16:47.526
All good fun.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.845
But we do have this school
funding initiative to vote on.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.961
Been sitting here for months.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.415
All in favor of...

16:55.440 --> 16:57.215
Cutting open
the Roquefort next...

16:57.240 --> 16:58.975
Aye!

16:59.000 --> 17:00.445
Well, okay, okay.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.935
A quick reminder,

17:01.960 --> 17:05.169
tomorrow is Trubshaw
Baby Remembrance Day.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.851
And we all know what that means.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.365
A performance by Madame Frou Frou.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.760
A vision!

17:12.920 --> 17:14.160
Now there's a woman with...

17:14.319 --> 17:17.005
With some cheese on her bones!

17:17.280 --> 17:20.965
A lady like that
is like a fine Brie.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.608
Raw, dangerous.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.569
Maybe a little stinky,

17:27.720 --> 17:31.455
but one taste and
you'll be begging for...

17:31.480 --> 17:32.641
Father.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.126
Winifred!

17:34.760 --> 17:36.440
Is someone there?

17:36.520 --> 17:38.170
Winifred, go on off
to bed. Off to bed!

17:38.320 --> 17:39.446
What is she doing in here?

17:39.560 --> 17:41.403
But, Father, I saw boxtrolls again!

17:41.560 --> 17:43.130
They're right outside!

17:43.280 --> 17:46.124
They could come rip
the flesh off my bones,

17:46.280 --> 17:48.015
- any moment.
- It would be a shame to miss this!

17:48.040 --> 17:49.455
Yes! Yes,
one moment.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.295
Winifred, proper girls
should not be obsessing

17:52.320 --> 17:53.455
over grotesque monsters.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.481
I'm not obsessed!

17:54.640 --> 17:57.375
I just can't stop imagining
them gnawing off my toes

17:57.400 --> 17:59.482
and stringing them
together as a necklace.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.975
You're getting
it all over your face!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.047
Father? Father.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.448
Yes, yes.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.201
If they kidnapped me and slurped
up my intestines like noodles,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.124
would you give up
your white hat to save me?

18:10.240 --> 18:12.129
Yes, Winifred... Father!

18:12.440 --> 18:15.015
What? White hat, right?

18:15.040 --> 18:18.442
Seems to have been
smudged by a bit of Brie.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.367
Be a dear and have the butler
give it a wash, would you?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.735
Gentlemen, I apologize.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.807
But...

18:24.080 --> 18:26.128
Back to
important White Hat business.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.047
I'll give your hat
a wash, all right.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.241
Ha!

19:32.640 --> 19:34.449
Who... Who's there?

19:55.480 --> 19:56.766
Who are you, boy?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.611
Boy?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.650
Why would she call me that?

20:01.840 --> 20:03.490
- Over there, Mr. Trout!
- Get them!

20:03.720 --> 20:05.290
Acquire!

20:05.440 --> 20:07.680
Left! Left! Keep going!

20:07.960 --> 20:09.007
Faster, Mr. Trout!

20:09.280 --> 20:11.160
- I'm behind you!
- Hold on!

20:11.280 --> 20:13.044
Right now!
Right! No, right!

20:13.480 --> 20:14.680
- Look out!
- Everybody,

20:15.120 --> 20:16.415
down!

20:23.360 --> 20:26.728
Someone's out past curfew.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.720
Very dangerous.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.847
I... I saw a boy.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.847
All I saw was
filthy boxtroll monsters.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.575
Miss Portley-Rind.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.001
Allow me to escort you home.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.600
I can escort myself, thank you.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.768
If you'll just give me
my father's hat back.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.845
Yes, how did
this hat find itself

20:58.000 --> 21:01.800
all the way out here?

21:02.680 --> 21:05.001
The wind blew it,

21:05.400 --> 21:06.640
right out the window.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.245
Very windy tonight!

21:14.240 --> 21:15.685
Must've died down.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.405
Suddenly!

21:18.880 --> 21:20.615
There's no need of
you coming inside.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.770
But as a gentleman, I insist.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.766
Lord Portley-Rind!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.175
Did you hear something?

21:30.200 --> 21:31.964
Can I have the hat back now?

21:32.800 --> 21:34.040
Please!

21:34.280 --> 21:36.760
What in Gouda's name
is going on?

21:37.040 --> 21:38.724
Archibald Snatcher?

21:38.960 --> 21:41.327
Deepest apologies,
Your Lordship.

21:41.560 --> 21:46.043
But I found something out in the
street that belongs to you.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.725
My white hat!

21:51.240 --> 21:52.401
I'll take that.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.847
Now, now, Snatcher,

21:58.120 --> 21:59.695
one doesn't acquire a white hat

21:59.720 --> 22:04.282
by simply picking it up off the street!

22:09.560 --> 22:13.849
A white hat indicates
privilege, prestige, position!

22:14.080 --> 22:15.764
It must be earned.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.969
With valor!
Chivalry!

22:18.120 --> 22:20.248
Or being rich.
That's how I got it.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.488
Don't I know it, sirs.

22:22.600 --> 22:28.960
Fortunately, we still
have our little agreement.

22:31.320 --> 22:34.642
When I destroy every last
boxtroll in this town,

22:34.800 --> 22:37.485
I shall earn my white hat

22:37.640 --> 22:40.484
and join you in
the Tasting Room.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.575
Good Lord!

22:45.600 --> 22:48.855
Not sure who should be more
terrified, the boxtrolls or us.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.366
Now, how the devil did my hat
get outside in the first place?

22:56.560 --> 23:00.531
I was told the wind had
something to do with it.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.806
The wind?

23:02.960 --> 23:04.086
Father, I'm sorry...

23:04.240 --> 23:07.130
Sorry, can't stay.
Too much work to do.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.651
Miss Portley-Rind,

23:09.040 --> 23:11.168
Your Lordship, sirs.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.209
I bid you good night.

23:13.480 --> 23:18.168
I'm sure we'll be seeing each
other again very, very soon.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.166
Winnie.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.401
Don't forget.
I'm a size six-and-a-half.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.051
Order ahead.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.605
Come on!

23:31.880 --> 23:32.927
Father, I'm sorry.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.486
I didn't mean to.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.285
Well, at first I did,

23:36.560 --> 23:39.006
but I think this situation
offers a great opportunity

23:39.160 --> 23:41.640
for a father and daughter to
discuss their feelings.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.731
Wait! I saw
something out there.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.415
A boy with boxtrolls.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.735
Not another word.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.888
But, Father, I really...
Bed!

23:53.080 --> 23:55.128
I did see a boy.

23:59.520 --> 24:03.335
Hark! Here come
the Exterminators!

24:03.360 --> 24:05.124
Exterminate!

24:06.040 --> 24:08.805
But don't that sound like
we're the villains?

24:09.920 --> 24:11.206
Run!

24:12.560 --> 24:13.800
Hark!

24:14.560 --> 24:16.961
Here come the Exterminators!

24:17.200 --> 24:18.406
Of justice!

24:18.720 --> 24:21.200
We exterminate justice!

24:21.320 --> 24:23.368
Faster!

24:25.040 --> 24:26.451
Grab hold!

24:43.640 --> 24:44.815
Over there, Mr. Trout.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.606
This way!

24:56.160 --> 24:57.764
My turn!

25:00.560 --> 25:01.615
Eggs!

25:07.000 --> 25:08.455
Help!

25:13.080 --> 25:15.481
No!
Eggs!

26:17.880 --> 26:19.455
Why do we do this, Shoe?

26:23.160 --> 26:26.562
Carry on like
everything is normal.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.525
They drag us away
and we do nothing.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.686
I look like one of them!

27:34.640 --> 27:35.971
Sort of.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.169
I'll find you, Fish.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.601
Wow!

28:16.680 --> 28:17.806
I'll get the first round in.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.769
Steady on, old chap!

28:22.120 --> 28:26.091
Gorgonzola,
fine cheddar and provolone!

28:28.880 --> 28:31.087
I want one! I want a balloon!

28:31.320 --> 28:33.687
Hard, creamy and soft!

28:33.840 --> 28:35.171
Out of my way!

28:35.320 --> 28:39.530
Get your picture taken
with the Trubshaw baby!

28:39.680 --> 28:41.170
A humorous keepsake

28:41.280 --> 28:43.328
for this dark and dreadful day!

28:43.480 --> 28:45.164
Get out the way,
you little urchin.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.243
- Hey!
- She's about to come on!

28:47.400 --> 28:48.760
- Come on!
- Madame Frou Frou time!

28:48.880 --> 28:52.009
Trubshaw Baby Remembrance
Day merchandise here!

28:52.480 --> 28:55.051
What better way to remember
that horrible tragedy forever

28:55.200 --> 28:56.486
than with a balloon!

28:56.640 --> 28:58.165
<i>Ladies and gents,</i>

28:58.320 --> 29:01.244
<i>from the long lost land
of Crackerslovakia,</i>

29:01.680 --> 29:03.250
<i>Madame Frou Frou!</i>

29:04.760 --> 29:07.001
Hello, Cheesebridge!

29:07.160 --> 29:09.845
Hello, darlings!

29:10.000 --> 29:12.571
Thank you!
Thank you, my darlings!

29:12.680 --> 29:13.681
Yoo-hoo!

29:13.840 --> 29:15.888
I'm your biggest fan, Frou Frou!

29:16.480 --> 29:19.006
Lord Portley-Rind,
you are too much!

29:19.160 --> 29:20.815
Or maybe just enough!

29:23.600 --> 29:24.895
Very good.

29:24.920 --> 29:29.175
Today, I shall perform
the sad tale of

29:29.200 --> 29:31.168
the Trubshaw baby!

29:31.400 --> 29:34.290
But first, I need a helper
from the audience.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.815
- Me, me!
- Anyone?

29:35.840 --> 29:37.695
Anyone at all?
Nobody?

29:37.720 --> 29:39.455
Excuse me, I'd like to...

29:39.480 --> 29:40.655
Move aside!

29:40.680 --> 29:41.966
Pick me!

29:44.200 --> 29:46.415
Little Miss Portley-Rind.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.603
You shall play the sweet
little baby Trubshaw!

29:51.080 --> 29:53.255
I saw a boy taken
by boxtrolls last night.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.361
What?

29:54.520 --> 29:55.885
Maybe your audience would
like to hear...

29:56.040 --> 29:58.000
Stick to the script, my darling!

30:08.760 --> 30:11.366
<i>Ten years ago A plot was hatched</i>

30:11.520 --> 30:13.966
<i>Where evil was
with cunning matched</i>

30:14.160 --> 30:16.481
<i>Whoever left
their doors unlatched</i>

30:16.640 --> 30:19.120
<i>Would find their
infant children snatched</i>

30:19.320 --> 30:21.721
<i>By boxtrolls</i>

30:21.840 --> 30:24.047
<i>No</i>

30:24.760 --> 30:26.569
<i>Boxtrolls</i>

30:26.840 --> 30:29.255
<i>Trubshaw Senior loved his kid</i>

30:29.280 --> 30:31.647
<i>The same as regular fathers did</i>

30:31.920 --> 30:34.215
<i>If you don't want
to share his plight</i>

30:34.240 --> 30:36.527
<i>Make sure that you
are locked up tight</i>

30:36.760 --> 30:39.286
<i>From boxtrolls</i>

30:39.920 --> 30:42.255
<i>For this night
Baby's Dad Trubshaw</i>

30:42.280 --> 30:44.442
<i>Quite forgot to lock the door</i>

30:44.600 --> 30:47.295
<i>And as soon as he began to snore</i>

30:47.320 --> 30:49.535
<i>The boxtrolls came in
to withdraw</i>

30:49.560 --> 30:51.289
<i>Poor baby</i>

30:51.640 --> 30:52.735
What?

30:52.760 --> 30:56.765
<i>Those vile boxtrolls</i>

30:57.280 --> 31:00.175
<i>So look your windows Bolt
your doors</i>

31:00.200 --> 31:02.415
<i>Or boxtrolls with
their creepy claws</i>

31:02.440 --> 31:05.125
<i>Will take your children
in their paws</i>

31:05.480 --> 31:07.369
<i>And drag them down
to feed their jaws</i>

31:07.520 --> 31:09.887
<i>Boxtrolls</i>

31:10.120 --> 31:12.521
<i>Mr. Trubshaw
went quite wild</i>

31:12.640 --> 31:14.642
<i>When he found out
he'd lost his child</i>

31:15.120 --> 31:17.248
<i>He did what any dad would do</i>

31:17.520 --> 31:22.401
<i>He ran off swiftly
to pursue those boxtrolls</i>

31:23.120 --> 31:24.804
<i>Help, help, help me,
please, won't you?</i>

31:24.960 --> 31:25.961
<i>But the boxtrolls did
what boxtrolls do</i>

31:26.120 --> 31:27.565
Look out, you idiot!

31:27.720 --> 31:30.415
<i>They snatched him up and
began to chew</i>

31:30.440 --> 31:32.488
<i>Until there was no residue</i>

31:32.640 --> 31:34.847
<i>Of Trubshaw</i>

31:35.000 --> 31:37.810
<i>They pulled him down
into their nest</i>

31:38.000 --> 31:40.162
<i>Hardly pausing to digest</i>

31:40.320 --> 31:43.015
<i>They left his bones
but ate the rest</i>

31:43.040 --> 31:45.055
<i>Never be a dinner guest</i>

31:45.080 --> 31:46.135
<i>Of boxtrolls</i>

31:46.160 --> 31:48.322
But she's lying!

31:48.480 --> 31:52.610
<i>Those boxtrolls</i>

31:52.920 --> 31:55.491
<i>And that's the story
of the Trubshaw kid</i>

31:55.600 --> 31:57.887
<i>Don't do what
Father Trubshaw did</i>

31:58.040 --> 32:00.884
<i>If you see boxtrolls
don't placate them</i>

32:01.040 --> 32:03.202
<i>Catch them and exterminate them</i>

32:03.400 --> 32:04.640
<i>Boxtrolls</i>

32:05.760 --> 32:08.650
<i>Kill those boxtrolls</i>

32:08.880 --> 32:10.689
Boxtrolls!

32:11.000 --> 32:13.526
<i>Kill those boxtrolls</i>

32:13.680 --> 32:15.762
Kill those boxtrolls!

32:15.920 --> 32:16.967
Kill those...

32:17.080 --> 32:18.255
<i>Kill those...</i>

32:18.280 --> 32:20.044
Boxtrolls!

32:20.200 --> 32:22.655
<i>Boxtrolls!</i>

32:23.920 --> 32:25.809
Kill those boxtrolls!

32:26.360 --> 32:27.771
Brava!

32:28.400 --> 32:31.643
Kill those boxtrolls!

32:35.880 --> 32:39.441
Don't forget about our
party tonight, Frou Frou!

32:39.880 --> 32:41.166
- Good show!
- Brava!

32:41.400 --> 32:42.401
Brava!

32:42.720 --> 32:44.324
Well done, Madame Frou Frou.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.165
Marvelous!

33:23.680 --> 33:24.841
What do you want?

33:30.600 --> 33:33.570
You're the worst
pickpocket I've ever seen.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.762
Here, buy a book on
how to be a better thief.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.607
Wait!

33:38.120 --> 33:39.804
I saw you last night.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.889
And they took Fish, and I don't
know where they took him.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.520
You were with the
boxtrolls last night?

33:50.600 --> 33:51.840
Yes.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.280
I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

33:57.440 --> 33:59.204
Father didn't believe me
but I knew it!

33:59.360 --> 34:01.010
How did you escape?
We went underground.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.051
Did they drag you down to
their hideous caves?

34:04.200 --> 34:06.360
Were there mountains of baby
bones and rivers of blood?

34:06.680 --> 34:08.011
What? Did they eat your family?

34:08.159 --> 34:09.969
My...
Did they let you watch?

34:10.199 --> 34:11.281
What?

34:11.480 --> 34:12.925
I mean, make you watch.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.324
Tell me everything!

34:20.960 --> 34:21.960
You bit me.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.083
I need to find
the men in red hats.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.165
You bit me!

34:26.480 --> 34:27.561
With your mouth.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.565
The men in red hats.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.525
The Boxtroll Exterminators?

34:31.840 --> 34:33.170
They live down on Curd's Way.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.400
How do I get there?

34:34.560 --> 34:36.534
Curd's Way?
Milk turns into it.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.375
It's not true, you know.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.447
We don't eat babies!

34:51.159 --> 34:52.241
We?

34:52.360 --> 34:53.804
What do you mean we?

34:53.960 --> 34:55.405
Come back here!

34:56.000 --> 34:57.889
And tell me everything!

35:01.520 --> 35:04.251
Poke. Poke!

35:04.400 --> 35:07.404
You ever wonder what they're
thinking about, Mr. Trout?

35:07.560 --> 35:10.655
I imagine they're evaluating
their life choices.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.366
Wondering why they chose to
be evil, disgusting monsters

35:14.520 --> 35:16.010
instead of good guys like us!

35:16.360 --> 35:19.762
Wrong, Mr. Pickles!

35:20.040 --> 35:23.123
A boxtroll cannot
choose a new life

35:23.280 --> 35:25.855
because a boxtroll
does not aspire

35:25.880 --> 35:28.611
to be anything more
than a weak, lowly pest!

35:30.080 --> 35:31.844
But a man,

35:33.200 --> 35:36.602
a great man, and his...

35:37.280 --> 35:38.855
Colleagues?
Best chums?

35:40.720 --> 35:44.281
...stooges can choose
to change their lives.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.642
Our dreams are in our grasp!

35:46.880 --> 35:48.295
Let us be
dream-graspers,

35:48.320 --> 35:50.482
fate-snatchers,
destiny-takers!

35:51.080 --> 35:54.687
Let's grasp our dreams and shove
them down everyone's throat!

35:54.960 --> 35:56.041
Am I not right?

35:57.720 --> 35:58.767
Throat!

35:58.920 --> 35:59.967
Yes.

36:00.240 --> 36:03.403
That's why your name
is the boss, boss.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.165
I'm not a stooge.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.246
Am I?

36:07.720 --> 36:08.775
Now, gentlemen.

36:08.800 --> 36:13.647
What better way to dream than to walk in
the shoes of those to whom we aspire?

36:13.800 --> 36:15.735
Mr. Pickles, fetch the...

36:15.760 --> 36:16.775
Shoes?
Clogs?

36:16.800 --> 36:17.935
Bat!

36:17.960 --> 36:19.564
Cheese.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.646
No.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.881
Dear.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.043
Nice!

36:41.800 --> 36:44.406
Men, don your white hats.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.282
Are you sure about this, boss?

36:50.560 --> 36:53.131
You know what
cheese can do to you.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.770
Unless you are referring to

36:54.920 --> 36:56.455
how cheese brings men of respect

36:56.480 --> 36:57.970
and power together
in brotherhood,

36:58.120 --> 37:03.095
no, I do not know
what cheese does to me!

37:03.120 --> 37:05.407
That's what I meant then.

37:05.560 --> 37:06.891
Marvelous!

37:07.160 --> 37:08.844
Then let us begin.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.288
Enough!

38:08.040 --> 38:10.042
I say, old chaps, it's quite...

38:10.280 --> 38:11.281
It's...

38:11.760 --> 38:12.895
It's quite...

38:12.920 --> 38:14.729
Aromatic? Oaky?

38:14.880 --> 38:18.135
With an undertone of a mother's
smile on a warm spring day?

38:19.600 --> 38:20.761
Yes! Those things.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.605
Etcetera, etcetera, big
words, chummy banter.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.007
Someone's got
the cheese fits again!

38:33.520 --> 38:36.569
Quickly,
quietly, get the leeches.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.643
Quietly, quietly.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.768
Where's he going?
Quietly.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.730
Is he getting more cheese?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.005
Quietly. Shh.
What?

38:48.160 --> 38:51.004
I think you've
had enough for today, boss.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.924
Isn't this nice?

39:02.080 --> 39:05.084
Chewing the cheddar
with the big cheeses.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.964
Holding my own

39:07.600 --> 39:10.604
with sophistication
and savoir faire.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.895
Yep, nothing
terrifying about that.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.283
This is where I belong.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.124
Spot on, as always, sir.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.520
You're not wrong, boss.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.887
Well, not here!
In this rotten factory!

39:23.120 --> 39:25.168
I belong up there!

39:25.280 --> 39:28.170
- I'm agreeing so I don't upset you.
- Very clever.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.324
In the Tasting Room, supping
on the choicest cheeses.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.888
Everyone in town bowing down
to me like a gentleman,

39:35.120 --> 39:37.043
a lord with a white hat! Fish!

39:37.200 --> 39:38.335
You've never been wrong, boss.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.535
It's a
time-honored tradition.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.243
Now, now, boss, don't
get yourself all worked up!

39:45.520 --> 39:46.646
Use your breathing.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.770
Stand back, peasants!
You don't touch your king!

39:51.000 --> 39:53.367
King Archibald Snatcher.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.000
Yes, I shall be king, too!

39:56.320 --> 39:57.375
Why not?

39:57.400 --> 39:58.640
Stay with us, boss.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.564
Tell us more
about when you'll be king.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.370
He won't let me,

40:02.520 --> 40:07.048
that pompous Portley-Rind and his
gaggle of giggling sycophants.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.280
Now, now, boss,
you be careful up there.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.615
Father always said, if you
worked hard, you get a white hat.

40:11.640 --> 40:12.846
Fish!

40:13.840 --> 40:16.095
And what
did he ever get? Nothing!

40:16.120 --> 40:18.168
Hurry, Mr. Gristle!
We're losing him.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.924
I've worked my
hump off for this town!

40:20.080 --> 40:21.480
And it's growing back.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.960
Wading through wet garbage,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.843
crawling after monsters!

40:25.000 --> 40:26.729
What has Portley-Rind
ever done?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.401
Eat some cheese, run the government?
Nothing!

40:29.560 --> 40:30.846
Eggs!
Shh!

40:31.000 --> 40:32.365
Come on down from there, boss.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.841
Yeah, that's it.
Just put one giant,

40:34.960 --> 40:36.815
blob-shaped foot in front of the other.
Let's go!

40:36.840 --> 40:38.175
I'll rip that hat
off Portley-Rind's head.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.295
Come on, come on!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.215
Boss, boss...

40:42.240 --> 40:43.401
I'm all right.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.125
Just give me a hand.

40:46.880 --> 40:47.961
Mother of sausages!

40:48.360 --> 40:50.124
Holy meat glove!

40:51.080 --> 40:53.367
Upsy-daisy now, boss.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.855
Dear.
Let's get you a nice cuppa tea...

40:55.880 --> 40:57.848
Mr. Snatcher!

41:05.280 --> 41:07.760
What is it, Mr. Snatcher?

41:08.040 --> 41:10.202
You!

41:10.560 --> 41:11.561
Me?

41:11.720 --> 41:14.326
Give me that hat!

41:16.240 --> 41:18.891
I'll make those Brie-stuffed
pigs bow down to me!

41:19.160 --> 41:20.400
I'm gonna be somebody!

41:20.640 --> 41:22.085
I got him! Do it!

41:22.240 --> 41:23.495
Mr. Gristle, now!

41:23.520 --> 41:24.646
Now! Now! Now!

41:24.800 --> 41:26.370
Leeches!

41:37.400 --> 41:38.925
You've got to help me, Fish!

41:39.160 --> 41:41.003
Okay!

41:56.840 --> 41:58.808
Hello.
Where were we?

41:59.200 --> 42:00.690
We was about to...

42:00.920 --> 42:02.331
Leeches.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.011
...put that new
boxtroll to work.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.975
Ain't that right, Mr.
Pickles?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.161
That is correct.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.760
Yes, right.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.930
Open the workshop,
Mr. Trout.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.642
Where is the beast?

42:33.880 --> 42:35.689
What? You're all alive!

42:36.040 --> 42:37.804
- Eggs!
- Eggs!

42:37.960 --> 42:39.291
Eggs! Eggs!

42:40.840 --> 42:42.205
There he is.

42:42.800 --> 42:43.847
Eggs!

42:44.840 --> 42:46.365
It can't be.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.405
It's not possible.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.721
It's not right!

42:50.400 --> 42:52.721
That's our boxtroll!
Give him back!

42:52.920 --> 42:55.207
Don't stand there gawking!
Get him!

42:55.360 --> 42:57.124
Chase time!

42:57.240 --> 42:58.401
Mr. Trout!

43:10.160 --> 43:12.527
Ten years and now you show up?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.162
Eggs!

43:16.720 --> 43:18.370
What are you doing with them?

43:18.520 --> 43:20.443
You'll find out soon enough.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.201
Up!

43:26.040 --> 43:27.530
I'm flying on a cage!

43:36.320 --> 43:38.049
Ha!

43:39.280 --> 43:40.930
Shoot, Mr. Pickles, shoot!

43:41.200 --> 43:43.567
It'd be easier if
he stopped moving.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.364
Stop moving!

43:50.640 --> 43:52.051
Thank you!

43:55.080 --> 43:58.050
Boxtrolls don't hurt anyone!
Let them go!

43:58.880 --> 44:01.770
Yes, well, I need them!

44:01.960 --> 44:06.727
They're my ticket to a
white hat, Trubshaw baby!

44:06.960 --> 44:08.883
Trubshaw baby?

44:15.720 --> 44:17.529
I knew there was something
strange about you!

44:21.760 --> 44:24.570
Miss Portley-Rind,
what a surprise!

44:24.840 --> 44:27.366
Does your... Does your
father know you're here?

44:27.640 --> 44:28.766
No, of course not.

44:28.920 --> 44:30.535
But wait till I tell him!

44:30.560 --> 44:32.847
The Trubshaw baby, alive!

44:34.920 --> 44:36.251
Sorry, miss.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.249
What are you doing?
Unhand me!

44:38.520 --> 44:40.921
Looks like the boxtrolls
have a new victim, miss,

44:41.080 --> 44:43.003
and her name is you.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.202
- What have you dragged me into?
- Eggs!

44:58.360 --> 45:00.283
Eggs! Eggs!
Eggs! Eggs!

45:00.640 --> 45:01.766
Run!

45:02.320 --> 45:04.527
I'm swinging on a chain!

45:05.160 --> 45:06.400
Whoo!

45:18.120 --> 45:19.565
Don't make no sense.

45:19.720 --> 45:22.405
That's evil prevailing overgood.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.131
If Lord Portley-Rind finds
out that that boy is alive,

45:25.320 --> 45:27.641
it will ruin everything
I've worked for!

45:27.800 --> 45:29.450
You mean, we worked for?

45:35.520 --> 45:37.648
I think we're all saying
the same thing here.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.763
I don't think we are.
Bah!

45:41.160 --> 45:43.811
But just in different ways.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.287
No!

46:08.360 --> 46:09.566
Stay away from me!

46:09.840 --> 46:11.001
Someone help!

46:11.200 --> 46:12.964
Wealthy girl in danger!

46:20.920 --> 46:24.447
If you're going to eat me,
just get it over with!

46:24.680 --> 46:26.967
I'm sure I'm delicious.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.610
No, it's not just us.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.569
All the others are alive, too!

46:37.760 --> 46:39.728
We saw them!

46:39.880 --> 46:40.881
What's going on?

46:41.040 --> 46:42.201
Oil Can, Wheels,

46:42.400 --> 46:43.640
all of them!

46:43.720 --> 46:44.881
Yes.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.281
I don't know.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.760
The Red Hats have them building
something in their factory.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.962
I said, what's going on?

46:51.880 --> 46:54.320
Why aren't they ripping out our
eyeballs and eating our faces?

46:57.520 --> 47:00.444
And where are the rivers of
blood and mountains of bones?

47:00.600 --> 47:02.489
I was promised
mountains of bones!

47:07.920 --> 47:09.922
I told you, we don't eat people.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.447
Why do you keep saying "we"?
You're not one of them!

47:12.800 --> 47:14.086
You're a boy!

47:14.760 --> 47:17.161
No, I'm not.
I'm a boxtroll!

47:17.400 --> 47:19.641
Eggs, the boxtroll.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.610
Really?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.888
Then let's see
you fit in your box.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.970
I can't right now.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.050
I'm long-boned.

47:34.360 --> 47:35.805
And you don't talk like them.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.002
I have a speech impediment.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.321
Your ears aren't pointy!

47:39.480 --> 47:41.050
I slept on them funny!

47:41.200 --> 47:44.090
For goodness' sake!
Give me your hand!

47:46.200 --> 47:47.770
I don't bite.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.646
Hey!

47:58.680 --> 47:59.761
See?

48:00.000 --> 48:01.650
You're not like them.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.531
You're one of us.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.883
You're a boy, Eggs.

48:08.960 --> 48:11.361
Or should I call you
the Trubshaw baby?

48:12.520 --> 48:14.568
Not true, is it, Fish?

48:15.240 --> 48:17.004
I'm a boxtroll like you.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.481
Aren't I?

48:22.680 --> 48:26.446
See? I was right! Now admit it.
Admit you stole him!

48:29.160 --> 48:30.207
Is he confessing?

48:30.480 --> 48:32.289
He says I was given to him.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.975
Ha! Right again!

48:34.000 --> 48:35.286
I... Wait, what?

48:35.520 --> 48:37.295
I was given to you?

48:43.560 --> 48:45.050
Who gave me to you?

48:55.840 --> 48:57.285
What's he saying?

48:57.520 --> 49:01.809
He says a long time ago,
there was a kind man.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.801
<i>The one man in town who saw
they weren't monsters,</i>

49:12.880 --> 49:15.326
<i>but builders like him.</i>

49:20.040 --> 49:21.405
I've tried adjusting the dongle

49:21.520 --> 49:23.761
and there doesn't seem
to be any possible...

49:23.920 --> 49:26.207
Look! You've solved it!

49:27.800 --> 49:30.087
Who's up for a jelly break?

49:30.720 --> 49:33.326
I tell you, I could eat this
stuff for the rest of my life.

49:33.560 --> 49:34.607
<i>But one night...</i>

49:34.760 --> 49:36.410
I'm being reasonable.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.642
I can be unreasonable!

49:38.800 --> 49:40.320
<i>Snatcher wanted
him to build something.</i>

49:40.360 --> 49:41.725
I'm an inventor, not a killer!

49:41.880 --> 49:43.564
<i>But he refused.</i>

49:43.720 --> 49:45.927
<i>And when the Red Hats tried
to take me away from him...</i>

49:46.080 --> 49:48.003
Maybe if I hold
on to your son...

49:48.160 --> 49:49.366
Not my boy!

49:50.720 --> 49:53.041
Run! Take my son!

49:57.320 --> 49:58.840
<i>And then they...</i>

50:10.480 --> 50:11.775
They what?

50:11.800 --> 50:13.404
They killed him.

50:39.200 --> 50:43.046
I think that kind man
was your father.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.166
What's a father?

50:47.520 --> 50:50.444
Well, a father's
the one who raises you,

50:51.120 --> 50:52.531
looks after you,

50:53.120 --> 50:54.121
loves you.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.928
Like Fish!
Yes.

51:01.720 --> 51:03.535
No.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.688
They're supposed to be like
that man in the story.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.889
Someone who'll do
anything to help you.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.891
They always listen
and never get angry.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.449
They guide you when you
don't know what to do.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.244
They're there when it's dark,

51:15.480 --> 51:17.528
when you're scared or lonely.

51:18.760 --> 51:21.445
And they are never ever
too busy to talk to you.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.046
You have a father!

51:23.200 --> 51:25.726
We can tell him
I'm the Trubshaw baby,

51:25.880 --> 51:29.566
and that the boxtrolls didn't
eat me and he'll stop Snatcher!

51:29.720 --> 51:31.688
But he doesn't really
listen to children.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.921
He's a father, isn't he?

51:33.080 --> 51:34.375
You don't know what he's like.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.323
But he's the only
father we have.

51:39.840 --> 51:41.524
Please help us.

51:46.600 --> 51:50.207
If I agree to help, you have
to do exactly as I say.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.680
I promise!

51:52.440 --> 51:54.488
All right, first things first.

51:54.720 --> 51:55.960
Off with the box.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.209
Stop that!

52:03.800 --> 52:06.929
All right, you petty
thieves, bring me your loot.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.041
Thanks.

52:15.400 --> 52:16.401
No.

52:19.600 --> 52:20.761
This might work.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.568
No!

52:24.480 --> 52:25.481
Yes!

52:27.760 --> 52:28.807
No!

52:31.800 --> 52:33.086
Yes!

52:34.720 --> 52:36.960
You look like a proper boy.

52:38.480 --> 52:41.290
Me, a proper boy.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.369
How do we get out of this place?

52:57.920 --> 52:59.331
Come on, Eggs.

53:15.480 --> 53:16.615
Stop!

53:16.640 --> 53:18.642
You don't scratch
there in public.

53:18.840 --> 53:20.524
That's why they're called

53:21.120 --> 53:22.531
privates.

53:23.880 --> 53:24.927
Okay.

53:25.280 --> 53:27.561
For this to work, there are a
few things you need to know.

53:27.680 --> 53:28.806
When you meet someone,

53:28.960 --> 53:31.850
you must look them in the
eye and shake hands.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.930
What are you doing? Put those down!
You said...

53:38.280 --> 53:39.611
Like this.

53:41.680 --> 53:43.015
The other one.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.041
Right.

53:44.400 --> 53:47.051
Then you say, "It's a
pleasure to meet you."

53:47.320 --> 53:48.890
It's a pleasure to meet you.

53:49.160 --> 53:51.655
And you say that even if you're
not pleased to meet them.

53:56.160 --> 53:58.925
Just stick close, okay?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.002
Is that all that's
left of the new Roquefort?

54:03.240 --> 54:04.571
Which one is your father?

54:04.760 --> 54:06.410
Lord Portley-Rind.

54:06.560 --> 54:08.735
He's usually making
speeches about cheese.

54:08.760 --> 54:10.095
Winifred!

54:10.120 --> 54:11.121
Hello, Mummy, dear.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.575
Who is this?

54:13.600 --> 54:14.655
I'm Eggs...

54:14.680 --> 54:18.401
Bert. Eggsbert is
a normal name that he has.

54:18.680 --> 54:20.569
Eggsbert? How nice.

54:20.840 --> 54:23.730
I adore names from the Bible.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.803
It's a pleasure to meet you.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.885
No, no.
You kiss a lady's hand.

54:30.400 --> 54:31.447
What?

54:34.040 --> 54:38.443
Darling, it's time to take
off that dress and burn it.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.728
Don't move.
I'll be right back!

54:41.360 --> 54:43.931
But which ones are the ladies?

54:44.360 --> 54:45.964
Ahem.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.131
It's a pleasure to meet you.

54:50.640 --> 54:51.641
Very good.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.320
Even if I don't mean it.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.443
What? Well, I never.

54:55.640 --> 54:59.122
And it's a pleasure to meet you!

55:07.240 --> 55:08.730
No!

55:09.560 --> 55:10.686
I was right!

55:10.920 --> 55:12.490
It's a pleasure to meet you.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.404
It's a pleasure to meet you.

55:14.560 --> 55:17.415
It's a pleasure to meet you.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.375
Well, I could just...

55:40.480 --> 55:41.970
That's good!

56:00.120 --> 56:03.735
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lord Portley-Rind!

56:06.160 --> 56:08.561
Distinguished members
of the Cheese Guild,

56:08.800 --> 56:12.122
we were here to celebrate
the successful fund-raising

56:12.600 --> 56:15.365
for a new children's hospital.

56:15.720 --> 56:19.805
But my fellow White Hats
and I decided

56:19.960 --> 56:23.760
the money would be
better spent on this.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.925
I present the Briehemoth!

56:28.200 --> 56:29.565
There you are!

56:29.960 --> 56:32.486
Come on. Such a naughty boy!

56:32.840 --> 56:35.571
We have so much to discuss.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.131
Alone.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.686
You're...

56:38.840 --> 56:41.320
Come to snitch on old Snatcher, did you?

56:41.480 --> 56:43.005
Hello, Frou Frou!

56:43.200 --> 56:44.531
Nice to see you, too!

56:46.680 --> 56:50.480
You really think Portley-Rind and his
mob will help a nobody like you?

56:50.640 --> 56:53.120
In this town, you want help,
you got to help yourself.

56:53.280 --> 56:56.124
That's what a man does!

56:56.600 --> 56:57.735
You're a liar!

56:57.760 --> 56:59.603
When I tell Winnie's
father the truth, he'll...

56:59.840 --> 57:01.569
He'll thank me.

57:01.720 --> 57:05.655
Because all your
little boxtroll friends

57:05.680 --> 57:07.125
are going to die.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.011
Tonight!
What?

57:09.160 --> 57:13.404
That'll make me the most
respected man in this town.

57:13.600 --> 57:15.841
They'll have no choice
but to give me a white hat.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.561
They'll parade me into the
Tasting Room on their shoulders.

57:19.720 --> 57:22.371
And I'm not gonna
let that be ruined

57:22.520 --> 57:25.490
by some little
boxtroll sewer rat.

57:25.640 --> 57:28.211
Yoo-hoo!
Madame Frou Frou!

57:28.400 --> 57:30.926
You promised your
snookums a dance!

57:31.080 --> 57:32.495
I did?

57:32.520 --> 57:33.521
I did.

57:33.920 --> 57:35.285
But of course.

57:36.200 --> 57:39.015
Watch your hands, <i>monsieur!</i>

58:00.120 --> 58:01.215
There you are.

58:01.240 --> 58:02.440
We have to get to your father!

58:02.520 --> 58:04.409
You can't just cut through.

58:05.880 --> 58:06.961
We dance!

58:07.360 --> 58:09.328
We'll what?
Like this.

58:09.560 --> 58:11.415
One, two, three,
one, two, three,

58:11.440 --> 58:15.135
one, two, three,
one, two, three,

58:15.160 --> 58:16.844
one, two, three,
one, two, three.

58:17.040 --> 58:18.451
Just make a box.

58:18.640 --> 58:20.404
You made me get out of my box!

58:21.080 --> 58:23.321
With your feet, silly!

58:26.840 --> 58:29.764
That's it, Eggs!
You're dancing!

58:32.520 --> 58:33.521
Ha!

58:52.560 --> 58:53.655
Snatcher is here.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.250
Who? Where?

58:56.760 --> 58:58.524
My turn, Madame.

58:59.200 --> 59:00.964
Frou Frou?

59:04.480 --> 59:06.289
Winnie!

59:13.640 --> 59:14.801
Eggs, look out!

59:39.360 --> 59:41.215
Is this part of the show?

59:43.160 --> 59:44.889
What is going on here?

59:48.960 --> 59:51.406
No! No! No! No!

59:51.560 --> 59:53.085
No! No! No! No! No!

59:53.640 --> 59:54.641
No!

59:54.880 --> 59:56.609
Ladies, keep back!

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.165
What have you done?

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.771
Lord Winnie's father,

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.805
people of the upper world,

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.081
Archibald Snatcher
has lied to you all!

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.530
He told you that
boxtrolls are monsters!

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.250
That they steal children!

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.175
But they don't.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.521
They would never hurt anyone.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.410
I know because...

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:52.051
Because I am the Trubshaw baby!

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.691
Outrageous!

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.095
Do you know how expensive
that cheese was?

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.167
What?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.930
We might as well have built
a children's hospital!

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.400
Did you hear a word he...
Not now!

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.680
But, Father...
Have you any idea

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.650
how long it will take my men
to fish it out of the river?

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.926
What?

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.081
The river?

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.370
If you won't listen to me,
ask Snatcher himself!

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.975
You have me!

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.968
I'm not a true redhead!

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.167
Poor woman.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.455
You insult our guest of honor?

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.527
Outrageous.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.091
I mean, who are you?

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.770
A proper boy?

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.725
He's with me, Father!

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.521
You know this creature?

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.480
- He's my friend. What he said is true.
- Enough.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.966
But...
Winifred!

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.283
I don't want to see you again.
Do you hear me?

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.575
But he's not the...

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.726
Leave my house.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.606
Now!

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.760
I've
never seen anything like it.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.882
These
parties are so confusing, no?

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.328
There, there.
You poor, poor dear.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.721
Eggs, wait!

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.368
You said fathers
were supposed to help.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.449
And they took care of kids.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.651
Well, they're supposed to.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.207
People are just
mean and selfish.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.050
They're monsters.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.286
Not all of us.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.246
You aren't.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.286
Well, I don't want
to be a boy anymore.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.520
It was a pleasure meeting you.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.047
Eggs.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.289
And, Winnie,
I really do mean it.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.295
Eggs!

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.004
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.811
We have to leave the cavern.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.442
We're not safe
down here anymore.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.801
Come on!

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.721
Eggs?

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.247
I said we have to leave now!

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.403
Snatcher is planning something.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.891
We have to get out of here.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.566
Come on. Let's go now!

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.607
Get up!

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.641
No! Don't just hide!

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.366
What are you doing?

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.767
Fish,

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.201
help me.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.601
No! I'm not a boxtroll!

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.647
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.366
Please come out!

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.081
Fish.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.686
Shut up.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.086
What?

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.681
He's here.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.485
How's that for an entrance?

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.165
Dramatical!

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.851
Don't you mean dramatic?

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.482
Get up!
That thing will kill you!

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.802
My, my, what a surprise!

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.608
Doesn't look like your little
friends want to run! Does it?

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.604
How strange, how peculiar.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.444
No, wait.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.648
It's exactly as I expected!

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.526
Eggs!
You have to get up!

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.361
Please!

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.321
Never gonna happen, Trubshaw!

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.766
Time to earn my white hat!

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.686
No!

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.845
Fish! Shoe!

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.848
- No! Please!
- Give up, Trubshaw!

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:02.209
Boxtrolls lost a long time ago!

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.855
These miserable pests
will never be

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.360
a match for a man with a dream.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.127
Mr. Gristle!

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.446
Eggs! Eggs!

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.242
Acquire them.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.651
Boom!

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.208
Never seen one do that before!

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.721
That boxtroll was mad!

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.571
Goodness always
triumphs over evil.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.570
Right, Mr. Trout?

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.850
Mr. Trout?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.768
I'm still 60 to 70%
certain that's us.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.330
Couple of good guys
vanquishing evil and all that.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.925
Jelly!

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.446
Jelly!

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.491
What the...

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.405
When I'm good, I get jelly!

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.051
I like jelly.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.481
Jelly!

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.320
Who are you?

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.160
Who am I? Who are you?

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.611
I don't know.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.295
Boy?

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.085
Or boxtroll?

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.560
Dresses like a boxtroll, but
looks like a boy!

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.401
A boy-troll.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.324
Yes, or a box-boy?

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:19.363
A new species never seen before.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.328
<i>No boxtrolls</i>

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:36.121
<i>Trubshaw Senior loved his kid</i>

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:40.126
<i>The same as regular fathers did</i>

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:43.930
He's my father?

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.487
You're my...
Are you my father?

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.966
Jelly!

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.886
He was once.

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.082
Won't get much out
of him now, though.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.881
A decade hanging upside-down
scrambled his noodles good.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.600
Still, did a fine job
designing this beauty.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.850
Best inventor in town, your dad.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.845
Working with
the best little builders.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.242
No, no, no. Don't hide.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:17.926
Fish, Shoe, run!
Get up! Get up and run!

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.082
Sparky, Sweets, run!

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.084
Yell all you want, boy.
They ain't gonna run.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.765
You can't change nature.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.889
I'm coming down, men!

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.162
I want to pull
the crushing lever myself!

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.843
It's the little moments.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.287
Yes, I see it now.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.411
A mutation of nature.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.928
Self-imposed metamorphosis.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.728
Box-boy, you did it!

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.575
I don't understand.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.170
You changed your nature.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.131
Tell them!

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.442
I tried.
They won't listen.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.415
You did it!

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.681
You made you!

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.001
Tell them.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.811
Tell them!

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.526
Box-boy!

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.166
Box-boy!

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.970
My son.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.687
Father?

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.123
Son! They can change.
They can do it!

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.165
Tell them!

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.489
Fish, Fish,

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.811
everyone, listen!

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.844
I'm a boxtroll
and I stopped hiding.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.724
So you can, too.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.046
Stand up for yourselves.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.488
We can fight back!
Don't be afraid anymore!

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.121
Sparky! Fragile! Get up!

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.891
Get up and fight!

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.484
Just stand up and take a step.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.569
Please! Do it for me!

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.930
Wow, good speech.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.280
No! No, no!

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.448
No! No!

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.286
No! Fish! Sparky!

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.522
Look what you did!

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.922
Look what you did!

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.365
Yeah. Yeah, look what
I did. They're crushed.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.806
Hey, boss,

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.963
your monsters are all loaded.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.041
All but one.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.965
<i>Hear ye!</i>

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.481
<i>Hear ye!</i>

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.361
<i>Good citizens of Cheesebridge,</i>

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.371
<i>come out of your homes!</i>

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.725
<i>The curfew has been lifted!</i>

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.041
What is it?

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.810
<i>Fear not!</i>
It's Snatcher!

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.329
<i>The monsters have
been vanquished!</i>

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.561
<i>Your streets are safe!</i>

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.921
Safe!

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.095
Curfew is over?

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.246
Yeah.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.084
I don't believe it!

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.561
No, it's not possible.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.162
<i>Join me!
Your purger of pests!</i>

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.967
<i>Your white knight who has
taken back the night!</i>

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.442
<i>Lord Portley-Rind!</i>

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.610
<i>I've come bearing the most
delightful news.</i>

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.765
Mr. Snatcher,
what the devil is this?

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.850
Show him, lads.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.655
Flattened to extinction,

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.240
every slimy one of them.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.285
Your Lordship,

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.255
I said I would not
rest until I caught

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.362
the very last boxtroll,

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.046
and I am a man of my word.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.805
With this boxtroll, I will
end their reign of terror!

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.166
Eggs!

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.602
I say that deserves
a white hat. Don't you?

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.848
A white hat
for Mr. Snatcher!

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.844
Yes, well, I'm not sure...

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.570
Our hero!

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.455
We'd have to take a vote.
White hat!

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.615
White hat!

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.687
White hat!

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.491
There's probably some paperwork.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.688
Then have a hat shipped in.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.524
No!

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.729
Methinks a deed
of this magnitude

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.247
deserves something a bit more

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.164
significant.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.166
I want your hat.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.491
- My hat?
- White hat!

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.120
White hat!
White hat! White hat!

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.520
- Chanting! Chanting!
- White hat! White hat!

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.767
White hat!
White hat! White hat!

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.610
All right! All right!

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.685
As soon as that
boxtroll is dead,

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.529
you may have my hat.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.815
Yes!

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.721
And then we can eat cheese
together in the Tasting Room.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.045
White hat! White hat!

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.691
Do the honors!

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.526
I thought this was all gonna
be a show like with Frou Frou.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.330
I brought my mustache
and everything.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.295
This really does
stretch the limits

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.004
of the term "hero," doesn't it?

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.615
Hat!

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.051
White hat! White hat!

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.961
Musician, drumroll!

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.887
Mr. Trout,
lower the beast down.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.975
Repeat after me.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.402
With this hat, I...
State your name.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.849
With this hat, I,
Archibald Penelope Snatcher...

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.362
With profound esteem
for dairy and dairy products...

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.965
Kill that boxtroll!

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.327
...proudly swear to uphold
the dignity of the White Hat.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.482
Proudly swear to uphold...

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.126
Father! Father! ...the
dignity of the White Hat.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.611
Not now, Winifred.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.762
And henceforth, whereupon...
Stop! Stop!

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.331
I can't, miss. Apologies.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.575
We're just doing our jobs.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.601
Your jobs?

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.535
Are you pest exterminators
or evil henchmen?

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.251
I knew that's how people saw us.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.404
Kill that boxtroll!

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.091
You don't have to do this!

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.535
She has a point,
Mr. Pickles.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.289
This could be our
chance for redemption!

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.535
A second chapter!

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.403
People love a flawed hero!

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.324
Sure, whatever you like.
Just let him go!

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.289
...as
thrice-aged cheddar...

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.808
Kill that boxtroll!

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.135
Kill that boxtroll!

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.215
Yeah?
Yep!

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.287
Yeah!

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.648
Redeemed!
Thank you, miss.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.841
Aha!

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.690
Stop it!

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.690
Watch yourself!
Let me go!

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.209
Kill the boxtroll!

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.287
Fish!

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.081
Jelly!

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.295
Boxtrolls!

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.651
And they're naked!

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.845
Naked!

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.291
What is going on here?

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.164
I am befuddled as Your Lordship.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.604
I crushed them myself!

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.649
Evidently not!

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.771
That was the closest you will
ever come to a white hat.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.410
I hope you enjoyed it.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.887
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.247
You're alive!
You're all alive!

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.763
But how?
I saw you crushed!

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.601
Sorry.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.765
He says they were hiding and then
they heard me yelling at them.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.405
Stand up for yourselves.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.201
We can fight back!
Don't be afraid anymore!

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.408
Sparky! Fragile! Get up!

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.244
Get up and fight!

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.449
Just stand up and take a step.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.686
Please! Do it for me!

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.644
Wow, good speech.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.055
Box-boy!

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.924
Look what you did!

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.886
You got out of your boxes.
You did it!

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.448
The boy is friends
with boxtrolls?

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.524
But boxtrolls are monsters!

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.127
Boxtrolls aren't monsters.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.203
They never ate
the Trubshaw baby.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.801
He's right there,
with Fish and...

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.886
My father.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.731
Your father?

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.442
Look what you did!

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.203
You were right. Thank you!

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.535
Jelly.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.735
Herbert Trubshaw?

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.895
The inventor?

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.375
Alive?
How can that be?

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.535
Snatcher said he was killed!

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.575
Snatcher lied!

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.680
He lied to us

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.162
and to poor Madame Frou Frou!
Snatcher!

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.815
We could've been something special,

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.161
but you've broken our agreement!

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.762
Why is he talking like
Madame Frou...

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.726
My God!
I regret so much.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.529
I'll take my white hat now.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.200
Run!

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.927
The curfew's back on!
It's back on!

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.964
No more hiding, right?

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.286
- Right!
- Right?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.845
You built this thing,
you can take it apart!

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.802
Lord Portley-Rind!

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.122
Come out, come out, come out!

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.285
I know you're out there!

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.204
Tear it down!

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.127
Get your grimy paws
off my machine!

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.809
We have to put out the fire!

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:41.967
Yep.
Yeah.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.241
Fish!

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.964
Mr. Snatcher!

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.805
How did this hat find itself

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.528
all the way out here?

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.651
You vile little brat!

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.851
Perhaps we can be of
some assistance, miss.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.202
So this is what all
the fuss is about?

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.449
What do you think, Mr. Trout?

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.127
You have a go.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.606
I think white quite suits me.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.481
Stop it!
You ungrateful stooges!

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.285
Is this what you wanted, boss?

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.125
Mine!
Mine!

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.287
Jelly!

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.890
It's not funny!
No, no, no, no, no!

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.163
Come back, you loony!

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.528
Jelly!

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.444
Oops.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.481
Stop destroying my
indestructible machine!

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.611
Fish! Grab hold!

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.250
That's right!
Pull it over the...

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.850
You filthy monster!

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.201
It doesn't reach!

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.608
Pull it harder!

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.649
You think you can win

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.488
and live happily ever after!

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.402
They'll never
accept the likes of us!

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.135
All together!

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.605
Pull! Now!

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.323
I'm nothing like you!
You're the monster!

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.130
Monster?

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.441
Careful.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.800
We've done it!
Huzzah!

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.371
Three cheers for us!

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.684
We've got the cheese,
Lord Portley-Rind...

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.049
I have lost a lot of blood.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.606
Eggs!

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.566
Not again.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.721
Winifred!

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.610
Give me my hat!

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.687
Well, what about
Broderick's hat?

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.048
It's just as white and fluffy.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.765
Take it.
Just let go of my daughter.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.201
Yeah!

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.528
Archibald Snatcher,
you've finally done it!

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:21.647
Now, to the Tasting Room!

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.168
Men, don your white hats.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.326
Please, Snatcher, let her go!

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.762
You don't have...
Enough! It's tasting time!

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:43.608
I present the
tastiest cheese known to man.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.655
Made from the milk of the male

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.411
lactating fruit bats in Borneo,

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.164
aged for centuries,

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.001
- in secret...
- Shut up! Enough stalling!

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.731
Yes.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.009
Rich bouquet,
cheesy cheese-like...

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.247
Father!

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.124
- My Winnikins!
- Father.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.604
You bit me!

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.650
With your mouth!

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.041
Bah!

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.525
Don't do it.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.207
It won't change who you are.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.723
Cheese, hats, boxes,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.571
they don't make you.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.851
You make you.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.287
I have made me, boy.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.606
This is my destiny!

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.605
Aromatic,

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.049
oaky, with an undertone
of a mother's...

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.283
And there I was,
trapped in his sweaty armpit,

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.802
until he swelled like a balloon and pop!

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.126
An ocean of guts
exploded over us

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.289
like a hurricane of yuck!

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.607
My little angel!
My weird little angel!

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.361
Winnie!

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.441
Where's Fish?

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.090
And now, I will tell
the heroic story

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.201
of the naked boxtrolls
and the Crusher of Doom!

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.762
I said, "I like it burnt," then
she said, "Well, I don't."

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.570
So, here I am.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.290
You guys seen Fish?

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.121
Thanks.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.255
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.201
Have you seen Fish?

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.281
Nope!

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.291
There he is!

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.401
Eggs!

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.688
Look what I found!

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.040
Brilliant, son!

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.009
And now, we go like this...

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.086
I've missed so much.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.615
Ain't that lovely?

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.575
All happy and tidy!

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.523
Like the end of a story.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.775
If our lives were a story.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.882
Not sure what
we'd do next, though.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.521
Wee!

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.530
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.250
No!

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.566
Jelly!

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.168
Just keeping the streets clean.

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.615
Free from evil.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.880
Yep.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.442
You ever think about
the universe, Mr. Trout?

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.321
What if our world is
just like a tiny speck?

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.811
A tiny little speck.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.962
And there are giants
looking down on us?

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.655
And every time we move...

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:24.321
It's actually them moving us.

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.535
Seems a bit tedious.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.695
Like that,
just there, me blinking.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.815
That would've taken them a day.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:33.535
Me moving my arm, 500 men!

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:36.495
I mean, none of them are going home.
They're having to do this bit.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.806
And now this bit.

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.006
And this bit.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.324
I mean, this should stop.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.571
<i>I think it throws
up notions of free will.</i>

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.215
<i>It's too much.</i>

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.447
<i>And then they would've
had to have done me</i>

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.968
<i>talking about the blink,
and it never ends.</i>

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.204
<i>I think they make
a meal of it, to be honest.</i>

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.528
<i>I don't know how
they get the time.</i>

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.242
<i>They've got to have other jobs.</i>

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.289
<i>It's more like a hobby.</i>

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.175
<i>You know, like stamp collecting,</i>

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.202
<i>something you do
in your free time.</i>
