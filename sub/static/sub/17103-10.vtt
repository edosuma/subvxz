WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:07.575
( theme music playing )

01:42.770 --> 01:46.207
( panting )

02:06.827 --> 02:08.696
( door creaks )

02:39.026 --> 02:41.395
( Lila moaning )

02:44.565 --> 02:46.800
OOOH.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.675
( panting, gasping )

02:56.176 --> 02:58.912
( moaning )

03:39.253 --> 03:42.556
THERE'S MY BUTTERCUP.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.885
- CAN IT, WILL YOU?
- WHAT?

04:11.985 --> 04:13.487
YOU'RE GOGGLING AT ME.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.690
- YOU'RE GIVING ME
THE CREEPING WILLIES.
- SORRY.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.035
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!
- I'M SORRY.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.471
I JUST-- I'M SORRY.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.307
WHERE'S THE FIRE?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.208
I GOT TO GET YOU TWO
BACK TO THE SHOW.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.411
THEN WHAT?

04:37.511 --> 04:39.413
THERE'S THINGS
I HAVE TO DO.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.049
I'M PROBABLY
TOO LATE AS IT IS.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.653
WE MESS YOU UP?

04:47.521 --> 04:50.691
IT COULDN'T BE HELPED.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.700
IT WAS THE BOY
BEN HAWKINS.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.936
HE'S THE ONE
WHO TOOK ME FROM YOU.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.439
WHAT ABOUT SAMSON?

05:07.408 --> 05:08.976
COVERED IT UP.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.480
I KNEW IT!
I CAN READ THAT
LITTLE TROUT LIKE A BOOK!

05:12.580 --> 05:15.315
- I MUST LEAVE.
- NO!

05:16.484 --> 05:18.852
PLEASE STAY.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.655
AH, MY LITTLE CLARINET.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.893
IN THIS BODY?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.795
HARDLY PRACTICAL.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.330
I DON'T CARE
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.632
DON'T BE A FOOL.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.602
ALL THAT REALLY COUNTS
IN THIS WORLD IS

05:34.702 --> 05:37.137
WHAT OTHERS
THINK OF YOU.

05:37.237 --> 05:41.108
BESIDES, YOU'LL BE
SEEING ME SOON.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.444
LIKE THIS?

05:43.544 --> 05:48.549
NO, MY DEAR,
IN THE FLESH.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.918
LODZ?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.753
LODZ!

05:58.659 --> 06:01.595
DEAR GOD,
WHAT'RE YOU--

06:07.701 --> 06:09.570
WHAT AM I
DOING HERE?

06:09.670 --> 06:12.172
YOU WERE DOING FINE.

06:12.272 --> 06:15.175
NOW YOU'RE JUST...

06:15.275 --> 06:17.611
LEAVING.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.629
WAIT HERE.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.632
- I GOT TO GET GOING.
- JUST A MINUTE, OKAY?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.934
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.603
REMEMBER,
NOT A WORD.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.639
- YOU ONLY TOLD ME
ABOUT 10 TIMES.
- SO NOW IT'S 11.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.741
WHAT'RE YOU GOING
TO TELL YOUR MA?

06:47.841 --> 06:50.243
WE WENT OFF.
YOU GOT LIQUORED UP,
IN A FIGHT.

06:50.343 --> 06:54.047
YOU HAD BEEN PINCHED
AND WE SPENT THE NIGHT
IN THE TANK.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.049
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.351
JESUS, CLAY.
CAN'T WE GO WITH
SOMETHING ELSE?

06:58.452 --> 07:01.088
- SHE ALREADY THINKS
YOU'RE A BUM.
- GOOD.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.623
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.958
HOW YOU GOING TO HIDE IT
FROM THE OTHERS?

07:05.058 --> 07:07.360
I'M GOING WITH HIM.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.296
WHAT?! WHY?

07:09.396 --> 07:11.364
I DON'T KNOW.

07:11.465 --> 07:15.469
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.708
- I'LL GO TOO.
- NO.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.543
YOU GOT TO STAY HERE
WITH THE SHOW.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.545
MAMA'S GOING
TO MAKE IT HARD.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.880
SHE'S GONNA TELL EVERYONE
YOU'VE LEFT ME COLD.

07:26.980 --> 07:31.384
THEN SHE'LL LOOK
LIKE A DAMNED FOOL WHEN
I COME BACK, WON'T SHE?

07:31.485 --> 07:35.055
- WILL YOU?
- WHAT?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.124
COME BACK.

07:37.224 --> 07:41.762
YEAH. I WILL.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.873
GO HOME.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.013
HEY.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

08:00.113 --> 08:02.816
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
HAD SOMETHING FOR ME?

08:02.916 --> 08:05.719
I DO-- ME.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.055
NO, I DON'T NEED
ANY COMPANY.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.158
WELL, YOU GOT IT.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.528
WE GONNA SIT HERE
ALL NIGHT?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.764
( sighs )

08:16.864 --> 08:18.999
AW, HELL.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.647
( man with German accent )
AH, JAH, JAH, I'M COMING!

09:06.747 --> 09:09.983
IT'S MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.885
ROOM?

09:11.985 --> 09:14.755
Ben:
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TWO MEN
TRAVELING TOGETHER.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.957
ONE'S GOT
LONG WHITE HAIR,

09:17.057 --> 09:18.692
THE OTHER'S
A BIG FELLA, BALD.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.695
THEY MIGHT
HAVE CHECKED IN
THE LAST 24 HOURS.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.765
WHAT'RE YOU, COPS?
G-MEN?

09:24.865 --> 09:27.935
YOU THINK I WANT TROUBLE,
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
( growls )

09:28.035 --> 09:30.671
AIN'T GOING
TO MAKE NO TROUBLE.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.405
WE JUST WANT
TO TALK TO THEM,
THAT'S ALL.

09:32.505 --> 09:36.744
I'M NOT A HALFWIT.
YOU CANNOT JUST COME
IN HERE AND SNOOP.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.026
OKAY, LISTEN GOOD.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.563
THIS IS NOT THE RITZ,
IT IS FUCKING CHEYENNE,
WYOMING,

09:56.664 --> 09:58.531
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
- WE GET THAT.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.869
THREE PEOPLES CHECK IN
SINCE YESTERDAY.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.438
THE FIRST ONE WAS A BIG,
HUGE, FAT WOMAN,

10:05.538 --> 10:06.940
THE SIZE OF A TANK.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.142
SWEATING ALL THE TIME,
DISGUSTING.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.845
FULL OF DONUTS.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.413
AND?

10:13.513 --> 10:17.951
AND TWO MEN
JUST LIKE YOU SAY.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.287
WAIT.
I WILL TAKE YOU THERE.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.856
COLD TONIGHT, JAH?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.793
ALWAYS TOO HOT
OR TOO COLD AROUND HERE.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.094
ALWAYS TOO EVERYTHING.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.630
NASTY BALD MAN REQUESTED
THIS BAD NUMBER.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.365
VERY ODD FELLOW,
THAT ONE.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.034
HEY, WATCH IT
WITH THAT GAT!

10:34.134 --> 10:37.738
- YOU WANT YOU SHOULD
KILL SOMEBODY?
- SHUT UP.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.143
HELLO?

11:08.568 --> 11:10.437
GOD DAMN THEIR BLOOD!

11:10.537 --> 11:13.340
I HAD A FEELING
ABOUT THOSE TWO.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.747
LOUSY NEEDLE-JABBERS!

11:19.847 --> 11:22.750
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THEY WAS FUCKING
CHRONICS!

11:22.850 --> 11:25.919
( muttering in German )

11:36.730 --> 11:39.099
( pounding at door )

11:49.676 --> 11:51.711
YES?

11:52.645 --> 11:54.414
I'M VARLYN STROUD.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.650
- I GOT BUSINESS
WITH BROTHER JUSTIN.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.787
Justin:
IRIS.

11:59.887 --> 12:04.124
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
- UPSTAIRS.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.828
Justin:
IRIS!

12:27.247 --> 12:29.883
( sobbing )

12:41.261 --> 12:43.797
WHERE IS HE?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.066
HAWKINS, WE BEEN
ALL THROUGH THIS ROOM!

12:46.166 --> 12:49.436
MIGHT HELP IF YOU TOLD ME
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR!

12:49.536 --> 12:52.039
I'LL KNOW IT
WHEN I SEE IT.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.274
FINE!

13:16.429 --> 13:18.098
WHAT?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.470
WHO IS HE?

13:23.570 --> 13:26.573
Ben:
SOMEONE I GOTTA STOP.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.431
THIS IS YOUR PROPHET?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.236
SCUDDER?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.906
HENRY?

14:01.008 --> 14:02.943
( chuckles )

14:03.043 --> 14:05.078
IT HARDLY SEEMS WORTH IT,
DOES IT?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.514
AFTER ALL THIS TIME
AND TROUBLE

14:07.614 --> 14:11.218
AND MR. STROUD'S
VALIANT EFFORTS...

14:11.318 --> 14:15.655
TO FOUL MY HANDS
WITH THE BLOOD OF
THIS PATHETIC CREATURE,

14:15.755 --> 14:20.060
TO RECEIVE THE BOON
OF AN IDIOT...

14:20.961 --> 14:25.732
BUT SO BE IT.

14:25.832 --> 14:29.669
YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY KILLED A MAN
WITH MY OWN HANDS BEFORE.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.571
IT'S FUN.
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.542
SHAME THIS LITTLE PIGLET'S
TOO DRUGGED UP TO FEEL
ANYTHING.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.378
DRUGGED UP?
DON'T!

14:39.846 --> 14:42.282
IF HE TOUCHES ME AGAIN,
KILL HIM!

14:42.382 --> 14:44.684
NO! NOT NOW!

14:44.784 --> 14:46.353
YOU WILL NEVER
GET YOUR BOON!

14:46.453 --> 14:48.488
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THIS BUFFOON DRUGGED HIM.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.991
BROTHER VARLYN WAS
FOLLOWING MY INSTRUCTIONS.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.993
YOU SUGGESTED WE KEEP HIM
RESTRAINED.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.029
PHYSICALLY RESTRAINED,
NOT DRUGGED.

14:56.129 --> 14:59.099
HIS MIND MUST BE CLEAR
DURING THE PASSING.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.001
IF HE IS IMPAIRED
OR DELUSIONAL,

15:01.101 --> 15:03.770
THE RESULT
WOULD BE DISASTROUS.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.705
( yells )

15:05.805 --> 15:07.975
HOW SO?

15:10.343 --> 15:11.979
MADNESS...

15:12.079 --> 15:14.514
OR EVEN DEATH.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.518
LET HIM GO.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.920
LET HIM GO!

15:25.558 --> 15:29.596
IT APPEARS WE MUST WAIT
FOR THE DRUGS TO WEAR OFF.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.972
( bellows )

15:48.715 --> 15:50.250
MY, OH MY.

15:50.350 --> 15:54.521
YOU'RE SHAKING
LIKE A PUSSY-WILLOW
IN A HURRICANE.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.725
MY, OH MY.

16:01.394 --> 16:05.098
I REMEMBER
THE FIRST NIGHT FELIX
CAME HOME NINE HOURS LATE.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.234
SAID HE STOPPED
FOR SOME GYPSIES
OUTSIDE OF TULSA.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.203
- MAMA--
- OFFERED TO HELP THEM
ROUND UP A PACK OF GOATS.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.340
THEN THEY SUPPOSEDLY
JUMPED HIM AND TOOK
ALL HIS MONEY.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.408
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH,
GOD'S HONEST.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.577
THAT'S WHAT HE KEPT SAYING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

16:17.677 --> 16:20.613
THE VERY IDEA OF YOUR DADDY
STOPPING TO HELP SOMEBODY!

16:20.713 --> 16:21.914
COME ON NOW.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.983
THE TRUTH AIN'T NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.818
WHAT IN HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:25.918 --> 16:27.520
YOU NOT THE FIRST
LITTLE GIRL EVER BEEN

16:27.620 --> 16:29.722
KISSED AND LEFT FLAT
BY SOME SLICK MICKEY.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.160
- THAT AIN'T
WHAT HAPPENED, GOD DAMN IT!
- THEN TELL ME WHAT DID HAPPEN.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.662
HE SAID HE WOULD
COME BACK AS SOON
AS HE MADE BAIL.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.765
SURE HE DID.
I KNOW THE MAN WE'RE DEALING
WITH HERE, REMEMBER?

16:38.865 --> 16:40.433
- INTIMATELY, I MIGHT ADD.
- MOTHER!

16:40.533 --> 16:43.303
- AND HE WEREN'T THAT GOOD
IF YOU ASK ME.
- FUCK YOU!

16:43.403 --> 16:45.305
LEAST I GOT ME
A WHOLE MAN!

16:45.405 --> 16:48.741
YOU CAN'T EVEN HANG
ONTO A CRIPPLE FOR MORE
THAN A NIGHT OR TWO!

16:53.580 --> 16:57.150
Stroud:
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU
KNOW IT, CLAP YOUR HANDS *

16:57.250 --> 17:01.721
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU
KNOW IT, CLAP YOUR HANDS *

17:01.821 --> 17:03.590
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT *

17:03.690 --> 17:07.127
* THEN YOUR FACE
WILL SURELY SHOW IT... *

17:07.227 --> 17:09.162
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
SLAP-HAPPY?

17:09.262 --> 17:12.199
IS THAT TOO TIGHT
FOR YOU, HMM? HMM?

17:12.299 --> 17:14.801
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
MAKE IT TIGHTER,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:14.901 --> 17:19.172
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU
KNOW IT, CLAP YOUR HANDS. *

17:19.272 --> 17:22.342
THERE.
THERE, THAT'S BETTER.

17:22.442 --> 17:26.679
NOW YOU BE
A GOOD LITTLE PIGLET
AND SOBER UP

17:26.779 --> 17:28.981
'CAUSE BROTHER JAY

17:29.082 --> 17:30.850
WANTS YOU ALL CLEAR-MINDED

17:30.950 --> 17:33.586
SO'S WE CAN
SLAUGHTER YOU UP PROPER.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.127
( whistling )

17:52.772 --> 17:55.142
( Rita Sue laughing )

18:00.613 --> 18:03.883
LIKE FATHER
LIKE DAUGHTER--
NATURAL-BORN LIARS.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.186
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU PUT UP WITH IT.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.290
I SUPPOSE JONESY IS
STILL ROLLING IN TAR

18:10.390 --> 18:12.325
AND FEATHERED UP
LIKE A SUNDAY ROOSTER?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.994
OH NO, OF COURSE NOT.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.530
THAT HAWKINS BOY,
HE'S GOT THE TOUCH.

18:17.630 --> 18:21.201
HE LAID HIS HANDS ON
AND HEALED HIM UP
JUST LIKE THAT,

18:21.301 --> 18:24.137
JUST LIKE SOME KIND OF
HILLBILLY WITCH-DOCTOR.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.140
( Rita Sue laughing )

18:27.240 --> 18:30.243
WELL, ISN'T THAT
A RIB TICKLER?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.979
HAWKINS A HOLY MAN,

18:33.079 --> 18:36.082
WHAT A RIOT.

18:36.183 --> 18:39.219
THE FACT IS,
LIBBY'S BEEN HITCHED
ALL OF FOUR DAYS

18:39.319 --> 18:41.087
AND SHE JUST CAN'T
KEEP THE MAN.

18:41.188 --> 18:44.257
I TRIED TO BE
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT IT,

18:44.357 --> 18:47.194
BUT SHE WAS HAVING
NONE OF IT.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.196
WELL, SUGAR,
AT LEAST YOU TRIED.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.432
YOU'RE A GOOD MOTHER,
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.861
I'M SORRY!

19:33.873 --> 19:35.007
( sighs )

19:35.107 --> 19:37.410
TELL ME
ABOUT THE PASSING.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.215
THE ONLY WAY TO...

19:42.315 --> 19:45.252
RECEIVE THE FULL MEASURE
OF THE BOON

19:45.352 --> 19:49.121
IS IF IT'S FREELY GRANTED

19:49.222 --> 19:51.691
IN SOUND MIND
BY THE PROPHET.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.361
SCUDDER WILL NEVER
GIVE ME WHAT I WANT.

19:54.461 --> 19:58.731
HE WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE
IF YOU TOOK HIM BY SURPRISE.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.100
BUT--

20:01.200 --> 20:03.270
HE'S SPENT
HIS ENTIRE LIFE
RUNNING.

20:03.370 --> 20:07.607
GIVEN THE DEPTH
OF HIS PARANOIA...

20:11.177 --> 20:14.981
NO.
YOU MUST TAKE
THE BOON BY FORCE.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.117
AT THE RISK
OF MADNESS OR DEATH.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.452
PERHAPS.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.888
BUT IF YOU HESITATE,
HE MAY ESCAPE

20:21.988 --> 20:27.226
AND THEN THE BOON
WILL BE FOREVER
LOST TO YOU.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.532
YOU'LL REMEMBER
YOUR PROMISE?

20:34.434 --> 20:36.469
WHAT PROMISE?

20:36.569 --> 20:40.006
YOU SAID I COULD HAVE
A MOMENT ALONE WITH HIM.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.877
I SAID PERHAPS.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.946
THAT'S HARDLY A PROMISE.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.383
BUT I INSIST!

20:52.485 --> 20:55.488
OH, YOU INSIST.

21:01.361 --> 21:06.299
BUT YOU SAID IT YOURSELF,
HE'S DANGEROUS.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.702
NO.

21:09.802 --> 21:14.173
I COULD NEVER ALLOW YOU
TO TAKE SUCH A RISK.

21:14.273 --> 21:19.779
YOU'RE FAR TOO VALUABLE
TO ME, WILFRED,
YOU KNOW THAT.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.754
YOUR TEA'S GETTING COLD.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.943
LIBBY!
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.680
COME ON.
WE NEED TO TALK.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.477
COME INSIDE.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.849
IN THERE?

22:44.497 --> 22:46.666
HAVE A SEAT.

23:10.289 --> 23:13.760
I WITNESSED A TARRING MYSELF
ONE TIME.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.962
SOUTH DAKOTA.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.565
WORST THING I EVER SEEN.

23:19.866 --> 23:24.471
SHE DIDN'T WASTE NO TIME
BLABBERING ABOUT IT,
DID SHE?

23:24.571 --> 23:27.640
SHE THINKS YOU'RE CRAZY.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.511
DON'T YOU?

23:34.280 --> 23:36.549
I KNOW ABOUT HAWKINS.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.852
NOT ALL ABOUT HIM,

23:39.952 --> 23:41.454
BUT ENOUGH.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.856
I PROMISED I WOULDN'T
SAY A WORD.

23:43.956 --> 23:49.095
THEN I HAD TO GO
AND OPEN MY BIG FAT MOUTH
AND SPILL IT!

23:50.597 --> 23:53.666
I'M JUST GLAD
YOU DIDN'T GET HURT.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.044
IT WAS JONESY
WHO GOT IT BAD.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.518
HE WAS BURNED ALL OVER.

24:13.419 --> 24:16.022
TILL HAWKINS
BROUGHT HIM BACK.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.492
YEAH, HE DID.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.030
IT WAS A MIRACLE.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.199
WELL, YOU MADE A MISTAKE,
TELLING YOUR MA.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.669
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.504
I KNOW.
I PROMISED JONESY.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.440
HE'LL BE
SO ANGRY WHEN HE HEARS
I LET HIM DOWN.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.442
HE'LL HATE ME.

24:36.543 --> 24:39.078
HE DON'T HAVE
TO HEAR NOTHING ABOUT IT.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.682
BE OUR SECRET.

24:42.782 --> 24:47.486
BUT YOU CAN'T BE TELLING
NOBODY ELSE WHAT YOU SAW
BEN DO.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.022
YOU UNDERSTAND?

24:50.757 --> 24:53.025
SO WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

24:53.960 --> 24:56.663
BEN WAS HEADED WEST
TO SOME MOTEL.

24:56.763 --> 24:58.631
AND JONESY WENT WITH HIM.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.533
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GO.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.102
I TRIED TO STOP HIM.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.706
NOW, IT'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

25:06.806 --> 25:09.542
AS SOON AS WE GET
A FIX ON THEM,

25:09.642 --> 25:11.744
I'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.014
YOU CAN SET
YOUR WATCH BY THAT.

25:47.814 --> 25:48.581
SHIT!

25:48.681 --> 25:51.450
( Justin laughing )

25:51.550 --> 25:53.586
( chuckling )
I'M SORRY.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.321
OH, DON'T BE.

25:55.421 --> 25:58.190
VULGARITY IS NOT A SIN
AGAINST GOD,

25:58.290 --> 26:00.627
BUT AGAINST
POLITE SOCIETY.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.494
AND BETWEEN
YOU AND ME,

26:02.595 --> 26:06.265
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT POLITE SOCIETY.
( chuckles )

26:06.365 --> 26:08.467
I NEVER HAD MUCH
USE FOR IT EITHER.

26:08.567 --> 26:12.772
BUT THEY CAN BE
MOST GENEROUS WITH
THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS.

26:12.872 --> 26:16.275
AND SO
WE ARE TOLERANT.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.449
HAVE YOU SEEN IRIS?

26:23.549 --> 26:26.318
SHE'S INSIDE
WITH REVEREND BALTHUS.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.191
THANK YOU, SOFIE.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.305
( moans faintly )

26:52.011 --> 26:54.446
YES, I'VE NOTICED
THAT TOO.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.216
- STRANGE, ISN'T IT?
- ( mumbling )

27:04.891 --> 27:07.760
NO! NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

27:07.860 --> 27:11.230
I ALMOST LOST YOU!
I CAN'T TAKE THAT RISK.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.133
( muttering )

27:14.233 --> 27:16.803
HE WON'T BE THAT LUCKY
THE NEXT TIME.

27:16.903 --> 27:20.139
BUT WE MUST
WORK TOGETHER.
THAT'S THE KEY.

27:20.239 --> 27:23.309
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN STOP HIM.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.816
JUSTIN.

27:29.916 --> 27:33.886
GOOD MORNING, IRIS,
NORMAN.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.423
OH, I DON'T MEAN
TO INTRUDE.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.759
OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

27:43.696 --> 27:46.198
FEELING BETTER,
ARE WE, NORMAN?

27:48.868 --> 27:50.369
AND YOU, IRIS,

27:50.469 --> 27:51.971
HOW ARE YOU
FEELING TODAY?

27:52.071 --> 27:53.806
Iris:
FINE, THANK YOU.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.142
Justin:
I'M SO GLAD.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.048
IT'S TURNING INTO
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.316
( chuckles )

28:06.618 --> 28:08.054
( sighs )

28:08.154 --> 28:10.857
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO INTERRUPT.

28:10.957 --> 28:14.460
YOU TWO GO RIGHT BACK
TO CATCHING UP
ON THINGS.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.229
YOU BE
A GOOD BOY, NORMAN.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.333
( chuckles )

28:43.589 --> 28:45.892
( knocks at door )

28:47.059 --> 28:50.496
YEAH, YEAH,
KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.735
ARE YOU MR. SAMSON?

28:56.836 --> 28:59.571
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

28:59.671 --> 29:02.108
THIS IS FOR YOU.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.579
MUCH OBLIGED, FRITZ.

29:07.679 --> 29:10.049
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT MY SAWBUCK?

29:10.149 --> 29:12.885
- WHAT?
- THE BOY SAID YOU
WOULD GIVE ME $10

29:12.985 --> 29:14.653
WHEN I PUT THAT FISH-WRAP
IN YOUR HANDS.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.990
THAT'S A MIGHT STEEP,
SPORT.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.164
HEY, FRITZ!

29:25.264 --> 29:27.766
MY NAME IS NOT FRITZ.
IT IS KLAUS.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.401
YEAH, YEAH, KLAUS,

29:29.501 --> 29:31.904
WHEN YOU SAID
ABOUT THE BOY,

29:32.004 --> 29:34.106
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT BEN HAWKINS?

29:34.206 --> 29:37.043
THE BOY, JAH.

29:38.945 --> 29:41.280
COME ON BACK HERE.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.449
COME ON! COME ON!

29:43.549 --> 29:46.552
DON'T BE
SO SENSITIVE.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.566
PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS
WITH YOU-- FRITZ.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.083
SON OF A BITCH.

30:17.183 --> 30:20.552
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
WE'RE MOVING OUT!

30:20.652 --> 30:22.955
LET'S GET
ON THE HIGHBALL!

30:29.495 --> 30:32.298
LET'S SHAKE SOME DUST!

30:45.344 --> 30:51.317
( Iris singing )
* WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE
IN JESUS *

30:53.252 --> 30:59.491
* ALL OUR SINS
AND GRIEF TO BEAR *

31:01.027 --> 31:04.763
* WHAT A PRIVILEGE

31:04.863 --> 31:09.235
* TO CARRY

31:10.602 --> 31:15.774
* ALL OUR LOVE TO GOD

31:15.874 --> 31:18.510
* IN PRAYER.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.584
Sofie:
MISS IRIS?

31:25.684 --> 31:27.386
YES?

31:27.486 --> 31:29.655
I WANT TO THANK YOU--

31:29.755 --> 31:32.358
AND BROTHER JUSTIN
FOR TAKING ME IN.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.661
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.365
IT'S OUR PLEASURE, DEAR.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.975
SOFIE.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.144
IT'S AN UNUSUAL NAME.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.745
JEWISH?

31:53.845 --> 31:55.747
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.616
MY MOTHER WAS ROMA.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.718
I NEVER KNEW MY FATHER.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.154
ROMA?

32:02.254 --> 32:03.855
GYPSY.

32:03.956 --> 32:07.159
GYPSY.
WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.862
WHERE DID YOU
GROW UP, SOFIE?

32:10.963 --> 32:13.665
AROUND.
HERE AND THERE.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.601
EVERYWHERE.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.737
WHERE WERE YOU BORN?

32:18.837 --> 32:20.973
ST. PAUL.

32:21.073 --> 32:26.045
MINNESOTA.
BROTHER JUSTIN AND I
LOVED ST. PAUL.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.215
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

32:29.315 --> 32:33.119
THERE'S NOT REALLY
MUCH TO TELL.

32:35.487 --> 32:39.725
EVERYONE IN NEW CANAAN
HAS SOMETHING IN COMMON.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

32:39.825 --> 32:42.528
BROTHER JUSTIN?

32:43.695 --> 32:46.398
YES.
THAT'S PART OF IT.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.936
BUT I THINK WHAT
BRINGS US TOGETHER,

32:51.037 --> 32:53.872
WHAT BONDS US
AS A COMMUNITY,

32:53.972 --> 32:57.609
IS THAT EVERYONE OF US
AT SOME POINT...

32:59.611 --> 33:01.747
HAS BEEN DISCARDED,

33:01.847 --> 33:04.383
THROWN AWAY
LIKE SCRAPS.

33:05.717 --> 33:10.356
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN HURT
IN THE PAST, THROWN AWAY.

33:10.456 --> 33:13.992
BUT YOU ARE
WITH GOD'S PEOPLE NOW.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.696
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

33:17.796 --> 33:20.266
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.769
JUST LIKE A BAD DREAM.

33:36.315 --> 33:39.185
MY MOTHER WAS
A FORTUNE-TELLER.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.889
AND WE TRAVELED
WITH A CARNIVAL
FOR MOST OF MY LIFE.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.557
A CARNIVAL?

33:45.657 --> 33:48.594
BUT BEFORE THAT
WE HAD A PROPER HOME,

33:48.694 --> 33:52.798
- A LITTLE WALK-UP
OFF LEXINGTON.
- THE TOWER, RUIN...

33:52.898 --> 33:56.468
Sofie:
WE DID READINGS THERE.

33:56.568 --> 34:00.206
Iris:
YOUR FATHER?
WAS HE A GYPSY?

34:01.640 --> 34:03.375
NO.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.777
Young Apollonia:
NO, NO, PLEASE. I KNOW
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.281
- DON'T-- DON'T DO THIS.
- Young Justin: I GAVE YOU
A CHANCE.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.150
YOU HOLD STILL,
YOU GYPSY BITCH!

34:11.250 --> 34:14.153
- ( Justin grunting )
- ( Apollonia screaming )

34:24.430 --> 34:27.233
( screaming continues )

34:27.999 --> 34:30.302
IRIS!

34:43.582 --> 34:45.651
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.323
I UPSET YOU.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.459
NO.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.827
NO, DEAR.

35:00.031 --> 35:03.135
IT'S JUST SO HOT.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.138
SO VERY HOT.

35:07.939 --> 35:12.378
AND I HAVE TO GET UP
TO THE HOUSE TO TAKE CARE
OF SOME THINGS.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.157
Stroud:
NOBODY IN, NOBODY OUT.
JUST SINCE I BEEN HERE,

35:25.257 --> 35:27.293
I SEEN A FEW FELLAS
I RECOGNIZED FROM
THE POKEY.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.295
I RECKON
THERE'S MORE.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.830
I'VE ALREADY PUT THEM
ON THE GATES, THE ROADS,

35:31.930 --> 35:33.799
SHOTGUNS.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.034
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GIVE THEM
SOME KIND OF FANCY NAME,

35:36.134 --> 35:38.804
- YOU KNOW,
FOR ESPRIT DE CORPSE.
- HOW MUCH LONGER?

35:38.904 --> 35:41.373
- WHAT'S THAT?
- SCUDDER.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.875
HE OUGHT TO PRETTY MUCH
BE DRIED OUT BY TONIGHT.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.112
PROBABLY CLIMBING
THE WALLS RIGHT NOW.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.848
YOU WANT
I SHOULD CHECK ON HIM?

35:49.948 --> 35:53.452
AFTER SUNSET.
DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL NEED HELP?

35:53.552 --> 35:56.388
WHEN HAVE I EVER
NEEDED HELP?

35:56.488 --> 35:58.890
( Stroud chuckling )

36:00.158 --> 36:02.361
Justin:
COME IN.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.431
IRIS.

36:06.998 --> 36:10.969
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
YOU TWO HAVEN'T FORMALLY
MET YET, HAVE YOU?

36:11.069 --> 36:13.672
BROTHER VARLYN STROUD,

36:13.772 --> 36:16.007
MY SISTER IRIS.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.477
PLEASED TO MEET YOU,
MA'AM.

36:18.577 --> 36:22.481
BROTHER VARLYN AND I
WERE JUST DISCUSSING
SECURITY CONCERNS--

36:22.581 --> 36:25.717
IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT
ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.854
I SEE.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.690
I'LL BE TAKING REAL GOOD CARE
OF YOUR BROTHER, LITTLE LADY.

36:31.790 --> 36:35.327
- IS THAT A FACT?
- STONE COLD FACT,
YES, MA'AM.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.896
I'LL BE ORGANIZING
A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.965
THE KNIGHTS OF JERICHO.

36:41.066 --> 36:44.570
WELL, ISN'T THAT CATCHY?

36:44.670 --> 36:47.906
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE WELL QUALIFIED,
MR. STROUD?

36:48.006 --> 36:49.708
Stroud:
OVERQUALIFIED.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.610
YOU HAVE A RESUME?

36:51.710 --> 36:53.445
A WHAT?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.947
BROTHER VARLYN HAS
EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE

36:56.047 --> 36:58.384
IN MATTERS
OF PHYSICAL SECURITY.

36:58.484 --> 37:01.253
SO IN OTHER WORDS,
HE'S A THUG...

37:01.353 --> 37:04.523
A FIRST-CLASS GOON.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.926
FIRST CLASS,
THAT'S ME.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.961
ALL THE WAY.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.955
Iris:
I'M FINISHED, SOFIE.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.156
THANK YOU.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.326
NOT HUNGRY?

37:40.959 --> 37:42.894
NOT TERRIBLY.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.930
Justin:
YOU SHOULD EAT.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.371
WASTE IS A SIN.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.841
SO IS GLUTTONY.

38:02.748 --> 38:06.752
DID YOU REALLY THINK
A DRIED-UP OLD SPINSTER

38:06.852 --> 38:10.889
AND A PATHETIC,
DELUSIONAL CRIPPLE
COULD HARM ME?

38:23.335 --> 38:24.870
MORE LEMONADE?

38:24.970 --> 38:28.640
YES, I THINK
WE'D BOTH LIKE SOME,
WOULDN'T WE, IRIS?

38:43.121 --> 38:45.090
Justin: SOFIE.

38:45.190 --> 38:49.661
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING
A SPLENDID JOB SINCE

38:57.002 --> 39:01.006
IN FACT, I WANT YOU
TO TAKE OVER THE CARE
OF REVEREND BALTHUS.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.610

39:07.879 --> 39:11.116

- Justin: YES.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.484
QUITE SURE.

YOU'LL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIS DAILY NEEDS

39:15.253 --> 39:16.788
AND HIS GENERAL
WELL-BEING.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.591
IT'S ALL BECOME A BIT
TOO TAXING FOR IRIS.

39:19.691 --> 39:23.895
BESIDES, SHE HAS
OTHER DUTIES TO ATTEND TO.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.267
WAIT.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.607
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME?

40:08.707 --> 40:11.843
I HAVE OTHER DUTIES
TO ATTEND TO.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.936
MY, MY,
WHAT A PRETTY SIGHT.

40:39.304 --> 40:40.806
WHAT'RE YOU
DOING HERE?

40:40.906 --> 40:42.941
GUESS
YOU'RE NOT TAKING CARE
OF BALTHUS ANYMORE.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.911
IS EAVESDROPPING PART
OF YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION,
MR. STROUD?

40:46.011 --> 40:48.747
YOU ASK ME,
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT OLD BOY

40:48.847 --> 40:51.883
- A PILLOW COULDN'T FIX.
- YOU'RE A VERY SENSITIVE MAN,
MR. STROUD.

40:51.983 --> 40:56.021
I KNOW IT.
AND YOU SMELL PRETTY GOOD
FOR A WOMAN YOUR AGE.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.590
- I'M NOT WEARING PERFUME.
- OH, I HATE PERFUME.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.291
I LIKE THE SMELL
OF A WOMAN.

41:00.391 --> 41:03.862
YOU KNOW, THE ONE SHE HAS
NO MATTER HOW MANY BATHS
SHE TAKES,

41:03.962 --> 41:08.734
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
SHE TRIES TO SCRUB THE STINK
OFF OF HER.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.969
- YOU DISGUST ME.
- DO I?

41:11.069 --> 41:12.504
- GOOD.
- ( yelps )

41:12.604 --> 41:14.573
- WE GOT SOMETHING IN COMMON.
- LET GO OF ME.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.374
THERE'S ONE THING KEEPING
YOU FROM BEING HAPPY.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.611
- YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME!
- YOU NEED TO GET RAMMED.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.780
HARD.
NOT A PANSY FUCK,

41:21.880 --> 41:26.752
BUT A TRUE BLUE BANGING.
SOMETHING TO BLOW OUT
THE COBWEBS.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.254
( muffled squeal )

41:34.392 --> 41:35.927
WELL NOW, VARLYN,

41:36.027 --> 41:39.765
THAT WASN'T VERY CHRISTIAN
OF YOU, WAS IT?

41:54.512 --> 41:58.216
HENRY?
IT'S WILFRED.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.887
YOU REMEMBER ME?

42:12.530 --> 42:16.434
HENRY, I SPOKE
WITH BENNINGTON.

42:16.534 --> 42:22.007
HE SAYS YOU HAVE
THE SAUNIERE MANUSCRIPT.

42:23.408 --> 42:25.811
WHERE IS IT?

42:26.411 --> 42:28.580
WHERE?

42:31.717 --> 42:34.019
IT DOESN'T EXIST.

42:34.119 --> 42:35.721
NOW, NOW, HENRY,

42:35.821 --> 42:38.757
WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S A LIE.

42:40.358 --> 42:42.427
DO WE?

42:42.527 --> 42:44.730
I GUESS WE DO.

42:44.830 --> 42:47.098
VERY AMUSING, HENRY.

42:47.198 --> 42:49.835
VERY AMUSING.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.003
I HOPE YOU'RE STILL SMILING

42:52.103 --> 42:56.241
WHEN THE USHER BEGINS
TEARING YOUR SOUL APART.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.145
GO TO HELL.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.714
NO, YOU GO TO HELL!

43:02.814 --> 43:05.350
BECAUSE YOU FAILED.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.886
ALL THOSE YEARS RUNNING
AND HIDING,

43:07.986 --> 43:11.890
ALL THOSE YEARS YOU COULD'VE
KILLED YOURSELF,

43:11.990 --> 43:16.561
BUT YOU DIDN'T QUITE
HAVE THE GUTS TO DO IT,
DID YOU, HENRY?

43:16.662 --> 43:19.798
DID YOU?

43:22.901 --> 43:25.603
HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO FOR YOU

43:25.704 --> 43:28.974
IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

43:30.075 --> 43:31.910
TELL ME WHERE
THE MANUSCRIPT IS,

43:32.010 --> 43:37.215
AND I WILL BASH
YOUR FUCKING BRAINS OUT
RIGHT NOW.

43:37.315 --> 43:42.387
THAT WAY,
YOU BEAT THE USHER
AND KEEP YOUR SOUL.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.725
HOW ABOUT IT, HENRY?

43:47.492 --> 43:49.160
GOING ONCE.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.428
GOING TWICE.

43:50.528 --> 43:55.400

BEHIND THE SACRISTY.

43:56.567 --> 43:58.904

44:21.693 --> 44:23.094
SORRY, OLD CHUM,

44:23.194 --> 44:26.664
BUT WE ALL HAVE TO GIVE
THE DEVIL HIS DUE.

44:26.765 --> 44:30.335
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

44:30.435 --> 44:32.570
( hammer drops )

44:32.670 --> 44:35.774
( shouts )
SMITH!

45:00.131 --> 45:02.300
( screaming )

45:16.714 --> 45:20.418
Stroud:
* IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU
KNOW IT, STOMP YOUR FEET *

45:20.518 --> 45:24.222
- ( stomps )
- * IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW-- *

46:06.631 --> 46:09.000

46:23.514 --> 46:25.884

46:31.189 --> 46:34.192
( engine starting,
departing )

46:36.794 --> 46:39.030

46:55.947 --> 46:58.249
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU

46:58.349 --> 47:04.022
WE'S VOLUNTEERS.
WE DON'T GET PAID,
JACKASS.

47:04.122 --> 47:07.592
I BETTER GO SEE

47:07.692 --> 47:10.595

( horn stops )

48:46.992 --> 48:49.394

49:14.419 --> 49:16.421
I'M THIRSTY.

49:16.521 --> 49:18.423
