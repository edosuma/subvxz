00:22.148 --> 00:24.525
In the beginning,

00:26.110 --> 00:29.321
God created the
heavens and the earth.

00:31.991 --> 00:34.326
And there was evening

00:34.368 --> 00:36.078
and there was morning

00:36.120 --> 00:37.621
of the first day.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.126
Then God said,

00:43.377 --> 00:45.629
let us make mankind

00:45.671 --> 00:46.547
in our image.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.216
Male and female

00:50.468 --> 00:52.595
he created them.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.934
Then

00:58.976 --> 01:00.770
the Lord banished them

01:02.062 --> 01:03.230
from the garden.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.789
Then Jesus told
them this parable.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.587
Suppose one of you
has a 100 sheep

01:26.629 --> 01:28.422
and loses one of them.

01:32.134 --> 01:35.137
Doesn't he leave the
99 in the open country

01:35.179 --> 01:37.473
and go after the lost sheep

01:39.183 --> 01:41.143
until he is found?

02:00.079 --> 02:01.956
Like the watchmaker,

02:01.997 --> 02:04.542
God, sometimes, will intervene

02:05.793 --> 02:09.170
in the inner workings
of his own creation.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.016
He'll make up for a bad past

02:21.058 --> 02:23.018
or mend a broken heart.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.530
No one really knows

02:34.572 --> 02:35.739
when he'll do it.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.911
Or even why.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.170
The only thing that is clear

02:50.212 --> 02:51.714
is that he'll do it

02:54.675 --> 02:56.927
all in his own time.

03:46.810 --> 03:47.978
- Aw.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.656
Oh, sorry, honey.

04:00.950 --> 04:01.951
- It's okay.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.788
- Oh, yeah, you're preggers.

04:05.829 --> 04:06.747
Duh, sorry.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.347
- I'm gonna be sick.

04:26.809 --> 04:29.228
Excuse me, I need in here.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.897
Yeah, hold up, hold up.

04:33.857 --> 04:34.733
Gimme a minute.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.778
I don't have a minute.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.033
- It's all yours.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.408
What?

06:25.094 --> 06:25.844
Honey.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.019
Dont'.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.395
Just go.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.772
Just go.

06:36.814 --> 06:37.898
Okay.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.485
Okay.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.906
It's all right, it's all right.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.034
- Sorry.

06:53.497 --> 06:54.289
Oh God.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.839
I ran out of pot yesterday.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.386
I can get you some.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.220
- No, no.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.639
Just, uh,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.684
I have some pills left.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.187
Just pick me some
up after work, 'kay?

07:17.229 --> 07:18.355
Okay.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.110
- You smell like booze.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.237
- Okay.
- Go take a shower.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.071
- Yeah.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.834
- Hey, what are
you doin', Jerry?

08:25.047 --> 08:27.090
Hey, that's not your sign.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.346
Don't make me get up.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.234
'64 Barracuda.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.695
No, '65.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.659
Oh, no, no, a little
change will do, pal.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.411
Just a little change there.

09:37.452 --> 09:41.039
It's only gonna go to
the nearest pawn shop.

10:01.184 --> 10:05.188
I have
a doctor's appointment.

10:06.898 --> 10:10.152
- Yeah, but are ya
leavin' leavin'?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.778
- I don't know.

10:11.820 --> 10:12.612
Probably.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.158
- I can kick these
losers out any time.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.909
- It's okay, Steph.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.831
We're headed up to
a party in Riverside tonight.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.541
Gonna be some sick DJs spinnin'.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.667
You should come.

10:25.709 --> 10:26.835
- I'll call you.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.966
- You're my bestie.

10:34.593 --> 10:35.469
- Thank you.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.187
- I think I got it.

10:54.946 --> 10:55.739
Bye.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.747
- Yeah, and I'm meetin'
Stan after work for drinks.

11:03.789 --> 11:04.581
Okay?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.289
- Hey.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.501
- You shouldn't
be here, Brandon.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.170
- Look, I just need to
take a quick shower,

12:33.211 --> 12:36.381
and I'll be out of
your hair, all right?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.303
- All right, come in.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.387
Hurry up.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.461
Built
up a cyber-force for years.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.243
- What am I gonna
do with this thing?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.168
Right of way!

14:37.210 --> 14:39.129
I got the right of way!

15:29.220 --> 15:30.847
You must be new in town.

15:30.889 --> 15:31.598
- Kevin.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.476
I just got here from Santa Cruz.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.103
Man, I, people sure are
generous around here.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.438
I jumped a train

15:38.480 --> 15:39.356
the other night with a--

15:39.397 --> 15:40.023
- That's not my business.

15:40.065 --> 15:40.857
Take a hike.

15:40.899 --> 15:41.775
- What do you,

15:41.816 --> 15:43.193
What do you mean I gotta go?

15:43.234 --> 15:44.361
- This is my spot.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.445
Get outta here.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.281
- Man, no, you weren't
here when I got here.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.574
And this is public property.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.534
I don't have to go.
- Take your business

15:51.576 --> 15:52.786
and take a hike, pal.
- No!

15:52.827 --> 15:53.912
- Hey, don't put
your hands on me.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.330
I'll file a restraining
order on you.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.498
I got eight restraining orders

15:56.539 --> 15:57.582
on eight other bums around here.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.417
- Get outta here,
you greedy bum!

15:59.459 --> 16:00.960
- You better be gone by
the time I come back.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.837
- I'm not leavin'!

16:05.423 --> 16:08.593
120 over
80, that's very good.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.432
Gloria,
can you bring Rorry's

16:14.474 --> 16:15.558
medical card up when
you're finished with her?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.560
I think we punched
the numbers in wrong.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.395
Thanks.

16:20.855 --> 16:21.856
- Thank you.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.961
When will this
morning sickness end?

16:44.129 --> 16:46.548
- You're beginning
your second trimester?

16:46.589 --> 16:47.882
- Yeah.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.343
- It should be
ending pretty soon.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.680
The second trimester can be
the best part of a pregnancy.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.265
The baby starts to move,

16:55.306 --> 16:57.434
your belly starts to show.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.561
Aren't you excited?

16:59.602 --> 17:00.979
- Sometimes.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.522
- Oh.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.525
- I'm sorry, I'm just
not feeling well.

17:05.567 --> 17:06.818
- It's okay.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.779
Your uncle will be right in.
- Thanks.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.298
- Watch.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.135
Stupid.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.013
Junk.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.731
Dr. Philips.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.735
- Your niece is waiting
for you in room one.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.695
- Thank you, Gloria.
- You're welcome.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.211
- Hey there.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.880
- Hi, Uncle Keith.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.760
How's Aunt Karen?

22:23.801 --> 22:24.927
- Not good.

22:26.596 --> 22:27.805
Cancer spread.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.516
- I'm sorry.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.187
I'm gonna go visit her.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.773
- She'd like that.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.860
This all looks pretty good.

22:40.902 --> 22:41.903
Uh, when was the last time

22:41.944 --> 22:43.237
you went to your OB

22:43.279 --> 22:44.072
Dr. Massy?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.951
Never mind, it's right here.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.328
Five weeks ago?

22:52.288 --> 22:53.623
I want you to see him next week.

22:53.664 --> 22:54.999
Okay.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.002
- What brings you, uh,

22:58.044 --> 22:58.920
here today?

23:00.546 --> 23:02.006
- I feel like crap.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.010
My glands are swollen, too.

23:14.018 --> 23:14.977
- They are swollen.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.521
How long?

23:16.562 --> 23:18.147
About a week.

23:18.189 --> 23:21.818
- All right, I'm gonna
give you somethin'.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.447
Take one of these for five days.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.782
Okay.

23:32.453 --> 23:35.123
- Physically and
mentally, tired.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.126
Emotionally,

23:39.210 --> 23:40.128
I'm a mess.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.047
- Well,

23:43.089 --> 23:45.466
ups and downs are normal.

23:45.508 --> 23:50.096
- I'm a lot of things, but
normal isn't one of them.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.557
- How you doin'
with your parents?

23:52.598 --> 23:53.891
- Take a guess.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.062
I'm sleeping on
a friend's couch,

23:58.104 --> 24:00.982
and they're on the
verge of disowning me.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.900
They'd rather keep up their
perfect image for church

24:02.942 --> 24:05.194
than to deal with me.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.905
- Yeah, they can be that.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.031
You understand?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.495
Look, I don't know how
to put this, Rorry,

24:14.537 --> 24:18.416
but I care about you.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.418
We all care about you.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.631
I'm just gonna be direct.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.258
You have options,

24:27.300 --> 24:28.676
and you're very young.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.100
- There are no other options.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.145
This is my baby and
I am keeping it.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.856
- You don't even know
who the father is.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.158
I hate men!

26:16.117 --> 26:17.159
- Brandon.

26:22.123 --> 26:22.915
Hey.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.422
Come have a cup
of coffee with me.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.026
So where have you been staying?

26:50.067 --> 26:51.402
- Friends.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.241
Look, I'm sorry.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.798
Look, I am worried about you.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.216
But I shouldn't have
to worry about you

27:14.258 --> 27:17.178
because you're my
strong brother.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.262
Right?

27:20.181 --> 27:21.140
- Sure, Gemma.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.268
- Well that doesn't
sound very reassuring.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.978
- Look, what do
you want me to say?

27:26.020 --> 27:26.896
Huh?

27:26.937 --> 27:28.230
That there is no friends?

27:28.272 --> 27:29.523
That I sleep in my
truck every night?

27:29.565 --> 27:32.109
Do you have any idea
what it means to be AWOL?

27:32.151 --> 27:35.404
I see Tim's face in my
nightmares every single night.

27:35.446 --> 27:36.864
- There is not a
day that goes by

27:36.906 --> 27:39.241
that I do not think about him.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.493
But he's gone.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.748
And, at some point,
we need to accept that

27:45.790 --> 27:46.791
and move on.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.755
Look, Brandon, it's
not your fault.

27:57.259 --> 28:00.221
I think you need to
turn yourself in.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.098
You need to be tough
and get through this,

28:02.139 --> 28:03.182
and I'll be there
to support you.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.267
- You're so high and mighty.

28:05.309 --> 28:09.313
Look, I'm outta here.
- Now, wait, Brandon, wait.

28:12.233 --> 28:12.983
Take it.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.670
You said that I could
play the game when we get home

28:32.711 --> 28:34.338
after I've done all my chores.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.132
How, how
many chores did you do?

28:36.173 --> 28:37.216
- Two.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.217
How many
chores do you have?

28:38.259 --> 28:39.510
- I have two chores.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.011
Which are?

28:41.053 --> 28:43.806
- I have dishes and dogs.

28:43.848 --> 28:47.226
Dishes and,
what about dusting?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.313
That means go
over, not just two.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.941
You've been having
the same chores--

28:53.983 --> 28:56.068
- But this isn't fair
because I already did 'em.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.153
- Like four years.
- No.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.487
- Four years.
- No, I already did

28:58.529 --> 29:00.281
all my chores.
- I'm serious, Liam.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.490
So I get
to play the game

29:01.532 --> 29:02.867
when we get home.
- Whatever.

29:02.908 --> 29:03.993
- Yup.
- We'll see.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.411
- Yeah, we'll see.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.430
- Welcome to the HOW.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.141
Honesty, Open-mindness,
Willingness meeting.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.269
My name is Brett and
I'm an alcoholic.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.229
Hi, Brett.

30:55.271 --> 30:57.398
- This is an open meeting
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.149
All who would care
to, please join me

30:59.191 --> 31:01.402
in the Serenity Prayer.

31:01.443 --> 31:04.238
God, grant me the serenity

31:04.280 --> 31:07.116
to accept the things
I cannot change,

31:07.157 --> 31:09.994
the courage to change
the things I can,

31:10.035 --> 31:12.621
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.455
- Amen.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.167
- It's amazing.

31:18.752 --> 31:21.171
The obsession's been lifted.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.385
My name is Scott,
um, I'm an alcoholic,

31:26.427 --> 31:28.929
and that's enough outta me.

31:28.971 --> 31:29.888
- Thanks, Scott.
- Thank you, Scott.

31:29.930 --> 31:30.723
Thanks, Scott.

31:42.651 --> 31:43.652
- I'm Keith.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.363
Hi, Keith.

31:48.282 --> 31:51.452
- Uh, I'm not really
sure if this is for me.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.079
I've been to a few meetings, uh.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.542
Uh, I really like your shares.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.923
My wife of 22 years has, uh...

32:09.595 --> 32:11.388
She's dyin' of cancer.

32:12.514 --> 32:15.559
So it's been pretty tough.

32:15.601 --> 32:19.396
So, I mean, I'm kinda
tryin' to numb the pain.

32:25.486 --> 32:28.656
Nine months ago, I got
pulled over one night.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.325
Let's just say I wasn't sober.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.329
So I'm dealin' with that.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.163
And, uh,

32:38.624 --> 32:40.167
my lawyer said I need
to go to AA meetings,

32:40.209 --> 32:41.293
so here I am.

32:43.587 --> 32:44.546
- Thanks.
- Welcome, Keith.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.513
- And lead us not
into temptation,

32:52.554 --> 32:54.973
but deliver us from evil.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.850
For thine is the kingdom,

32:56.892 --> 32:59.395
and the power, and the glory,

32:59.436 --> 33:00.646
forever, amen.

33:02.398 --> 33:06.360
Keep comin' back,
it works if you work it.

33:17.454 --> 33:19.164
Great,
we'll see ya tomorrow.

33:19.206 --> 33:20.207
- I'll be here.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.549
- Need my card signed.

33:28.590 --> 33:29.758
- Get well card.

33:38.559 --> 33:39.768
If you ever need
anyone to talk to,

33:39.810 --> 33:41.437
my number's on the back.

33:41.478 --> 33:42.563
- Uh, thanks.

33:43.605 --> 33:46.316
- I know it must be, uh, tough.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.445
The cancer.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.029
My mom had it.

33:52.656 --> 33:53.449
- Yeah.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.203
- Fine, thank you.

36:57.716 --> 37:01.553

here tonight, huh?

37:01.595 --> 37:02.512

37:07.267 --> 37:08.268

37:09.770 --> 37:10.687

37:12.147 --> 37:13.190

37:13.231 --> 37:15.692
- Nice to meet you, Lupe.

37:22.699 --> 37:26.244
Lupe, I used to be a
civil engineer over there.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.579
- Yeah.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.540
- Naw, naw, naw.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.295
- Uh, it's been
about 12 or 13 years.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.298
You know.

37:40.968 --> 37:43.845
- I work on the streets
and I panhandle.

37:45.097 --> 37:46.682
Beg for money.

37:47.808 --> 37:48.892
- Yeah.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.186
- You know.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.817
Sorta got mad with
the world, you know?

37:56.858 --> 37:59.987
Got angry, didn't care anymore.

38:00.028 --> 38:00.904
You know?

38:00.946 --> 38:02.990
- I get mad at the world, too.

38:03.031 --> 38:04.574
- Yeah.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.911
- But then I know I am
lucky to live in America.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.915
- That's a good attitude, Lupe.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.128
Naw, naw.

38:17.379 --> 38:20.173
I'm a happy guy now.
- That's good.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.759
- Nah, I'm okay,
I'm all set, honey.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.927
Thank you.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.721

38:32.352 --> 38:33.437

39:25.614 --> 39:26.406

41:33.158 --> 41:35.660

41:35.702 --> 41:37.329
Took this in the
backyard at Mom and Dad's

41:37.370 --> 41:40.624
right when I got
back from deployment.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.045
- Killed himself.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.838
- Sorry to hear that, brother.

41:56.765 --> 41:58.892
- Come on, dog, shoot it.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.813
Time to pay up.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.190
- Drinks are on you then, fool.

42:05.232 --> 42:07.442
- Whatever man, I
gotta take a whizz.

42:07.484 --> 42:10.695

White] Yeah, me too.

42:13.490 --> 42:14.783

42:18.411 --> 42:19.829

Hey.

43:42.454 --> 43:44.122
Why does this fool
have your card?

43:44.164 --> 43:45.498
- I don't know.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.753
What's up, bro?

43:49.794 --> 43:51.046
- Not interested.

43:51.087 --> 43:54.549
- I didn't ask if
you were, homie.

43:54.591 --> 43:55.633
Yo, this
guy's got a boyfriend.

44:00.263 --> 44:02.515
Jeannie,

Oh, what happened?

45:19.008 --> 45:20.135
You want me to call 911 here?

45:20.176 --> 45:22.178
- No, no, I'm fine.

45:29.686 --> 45:31.563
You want me to get you to
a hospital or somethin'?

45:31.604 --> 45:33.606
- No, I'm fine.

45:33.648 --> 45:34.524
- You might have a concussion.

45:34.566 --> 45:36.651
That thing don't look too good.

45:40.238 --> 45:41.948
Here, here, I got some water.

How 'bout some water?

I'm Jerry.

45:56.629 --> 45:58.214

45:58.256 --> 46:01.092

into, a bar fight?

46:01.134 --> 46:01.926
- Yep.

46:03.428 --> 46:06.097
- I been in a few
of those myself.

46:06.139 --> 46:08.725
That's why I don't drink in
the bars over there no more.

46:08.766 --> 46:11.352
Specially that one over there.

46:11.394 --> 46:12.270
- Nice.
- This place is goin'

46:12.312 --> 46:14.272

46:16.357 --> 46:18.359
Anything broken?

46:18.401 --> 46:20.570
- I don't know, maybe a rib.

46:21.654 --> 46:23.948
I've had 'em broken before.

46:25.116 --> 46:27.911
- Havin' a rough
one there, huh, kid?

46:27.952 --> 46:31.331
- Definitely havin'
one of those days, man.

46:31.372 --> 46:32.916
Who am I kiddin'?

46:32.957 --> 46:34.417
One of those years.

46:35.710 --> 46:38.838
- Sounds like you've
joined the club.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.347
- You could say that.

46:51.017 --> 46:52.352
Jerry, right?

46:52.393 --> 46:54.229
- Yeah, Jerry, yeah.

47:00.485 --> 47:01.277
- Yeah.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.406
- Thank you for your service.

47:08.868 --> 47:10.411
- You're welcome.

47:14.290 --> 47:16.543
I was deployed to Afghanistan.

47:16.584 --> 47:17.377
- Wow.

47:22.048 --> 47:25.343
- I had to kill four
Al Qaeda, and one kid.

47:25.385 --> 47:26.844
- Oh.

47:26.886 --> 47:28.388
- Kid with a gun.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.102
I'm tellin' you this, Jerry,

47:34.143 --> 47:35.728
'cause I have a
question for you.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.772
- Okay, go ahead, shoot.

47:39.274 --> 47:42.277
- If a man takes
another man's life,

47:44.153 --> 47:46.322
can he ever find redemption?

47:48.157 --> 47:50.243
Is his karma inescapable?

47:51.494 --> 47:52.704
- Well, killing in
war is different.

47:52.745 --> 47:56.499
- Aw, they say that,
but it's not true.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.042
- I believe it, you know,

47:58.084 --> 48:00.795
it lies within a man's
heart when he kills in war.

48:00.837 --> 48:03.131
And only you can know that.

48:04.757 --> 48:06.843
You survived and you're alive

48:06.884 --> 48:08.511
and now your home.

48:09.721 --> 48:11.431
- Yeah, I survived.

48:13.057 --> 48:13.975
I survived.

48:16.936 --> 48:18.146
I'm not alive.

48:19.522 --> 48:20.982
- Come on, kid, sure you are.

48:21.024 --> 48:23.234
You're sittin' right here.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.365
- You ever lose anyone
close to you, Jerry?

48:29.407 --> 48:31.993
- Oh yeah, oh yeah, quite a few.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.497
- I had a brother who
just blew his head off.

48:36.539 --> 48:38.625
- Oh, sorry to hear that.

48:40.585 --> 48:43.963
- I hate the Army for
drivin' him to do it!

48:44.005 --> 48:46.007
- I don't blame ya, pal.

48:50.511 --> 48:53.431
- And myself for
not bein' there.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.436
- Now, look, Brandon, here.

48:58.478 --> 49:00.563
I want ya to have
somethin', here.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.690
- I can't take that.

49:02.732 --> 49:03.983
- No, no, no, really.

49:04.025 --> 49:06.194
Come on, you, you
must take this.

49:06.235 --> 49:07.445
I can't explain it now,

49:07.487 --> 49:10.365
but I think that'll
help ya, really.

49:10.406 --> 49:11.616
Yeah, wear it.

49:13.201 --> 49:15.078
- All right.

49:15.119 --> 49:16.537
- Thanks.
- Sure.

49:19.582 --> 49:22.460
- You seem like a
really nice guy, Jerry.

49:22.502 --> 49:25.630
- That's a pretty
new thing for me.

49:28.257 --> 49:30.426
You gonna be all right, kid?

49:31.552 --> 49:33.179
- I'll be all right.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.641

49:46.609 --> 49:48.569

50:12.593 --> 50:13.678

50:14.470 --> 50:16.889
You just call the office?

50:16.931 --> 50:18.641
No, no, I'm just, uh,

50:19.851 --> 50:21.686
I'm just gonna do
a few more, uh,

50:21.728 --> 50:23.354
files and go home.

50:24.522 --> 50:26.816
How was, uh, how was chemo?

50:27.817 --> 50:28.609
Yeah.

50:30.695 --> 50:33.906
Oh, yeah, lemme,

50:33.948 --> 50:34.741

Uh,

50:40.037 --> 50:43.499
Skywalker OG Kush,

And pick it up at
the same dispensary?

50:46.461 --> 50:47.253
Yeah.

50:48.421 --> 50:49.213
Okay.

50:50.506 --> 50:51.674
Yeah, yeah.

50:51.716 --> 50:54.218
No, no, Chinese sounds awesome.

50:57.138 --> 50:58.055
I love you.

52:35.069 --> 52:36.070
- Hi.

52:36.112 --> 52:37.321
Hi.

52:39.323 --> 52:40.825
Are you havin' car trouble?

52:40.867 --> 52:42.577
- I ran out of gas.

52:42.618 --> 52:45.371
Uh, do
you have a container?

52:45.413 --> 52:46.163
- No.

52:46.205 --> 52:48.499
Well, I do.

52:48.541 --> 52:51.419
A young lady like you
shouldn't be hitchhiking.

52:53.462 --> 52:55.006
And I have mace.

52:55.047 --> 52:56.716
Well okay.

52:56.757 --> 52:58.175
Eh, get in.

53:07.935 --> 53:08.853
- Thanks.

53:21.657 --> 53:22.533
There's a gas station

53:22.575 --> 53:24.619
a couple miles up the road.

53:24.660 --> 53:25.786
- Great, thanks.

53:25.828 --> 53:28.205
You're welcome.

53:28.247 --> 53:29.582
A little chilly out.

53:29.624 --> 53:30.416
- Yeah.

53:32.084 --> 53:33.502
My name's Rorry.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.880
Hi, Rorry.

53:35.922 --> 53:36.923
I'm Charlie.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.593
- I've never ran
out of gas before.

53:40.635 --> 53:41.844
Or hitchhiked.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.431
Do
you have Triple A?

53:45.473 --> 53:47.224
- I don't have my card on me.

01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:25.956
- Tim!

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:28.000
Just lay back, lay back.

01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:44.224
It's actually a '65.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.101
You know your cars.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.227
- A little bit.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:50.272
I used to work on cars
with one of my uncles.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.108
This one is in great condition.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.610
Thanks.

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:08.207
- Do you mind if I ask
you something, Charlie?

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.167
Go for it.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.629
I don't
think about religion

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.508
as much as I think
about relationships.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:18.759
- That's cool.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:22.137
I'm not religious or spiritual.

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:30.270
My mother married
this Evangelical

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:32.606
who I know is a total fake.

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.276
Well what
makes you say that?

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.320
- He's just not genuine.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:42.074
You seem genuine, Charlie.

01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:47.079
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:48.414
I do.

01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:54.795
- He's completely
manipulating her.

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:57.339
She's a different person now.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:05.305
I have my own issues going on.

01:02:11.437 --> 01:02:15.232
I got pregnant from
a one-night stand.

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:17.151
And they kicked me out.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:22.406
They said I was an
abomination to God.

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:26.994
Isn't that nice?

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:31.331
I'm sorry
to hear that, Rorry.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:43.218
Things aren't always what they
seem on the outside, Rorry.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.680
Unfortunately,
some people believe

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:49.349
fear maintains obedience

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:50.726
more than love.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:55.314
- I feel like I know you.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.524
You don't go to my
parents' church, do you?

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.902
Well,
if I was there,

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.946
you probably would
not have seen me.

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:25.886
- You know, we're
both very lucky.

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:29.097
No broken bones, no
internal bleeding.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:31.475
You got a bruised rib,

01:03:31.517 --> 01:03:34.353
and I stitched up that left eye.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:42.402
What were you doin' in
the middle of the road?

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:46.490
- I don't know.

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:50.619
Well, earlier in the night,

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:54.248
I got into a fight with
a couple guys at the bar.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.625
They beat me up pretty bad.

01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.670
There was this old man.

01:04:00.546 --> 01:04:01.338
Jerry.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.508
He helped me.

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:09.346
I was driving and I got tired

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:11.974
so I pulled over and passed out.

01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:17.938
Then I started havin'
these vivid flashbacks.

01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:21.900
It's weird.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:24.152
I can't quite explain it,

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.405
but something's different.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.913
- Something's
different about me.

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:39.960
I remember lookin'
at this wristwatch.

01:04:40.002 --> 01:04:41.461
There was darkness.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:45.507
It was evil.

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:48.927
Then white light came.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:55.058
I think I saw my brother.

01:04:59.104 --> 01:04:59.896
- Yeah.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:04.985
- That's interesting.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.030
Sounds like your

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.449
life flashed before your eyes.

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:14.494
Well, glad you're okay.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:17.831
I'm gonna go to my
office next door.

01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:19.541
If you need anything,
let me know.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.793
There's a bathroom
down the hall.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:24.713
You can leave
whenever you want to.

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:29.551
I guess we're lucky, Brandon.

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:51.406
Well,
they're not my children.

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:57.537
Let's just say I
have someone to watch over.

01:06:00.332 --> 01:06:02.417
- I never knew my real dad.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:06.338
I'm carrying this
baby for some Navy guy

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.548
who I probably will
never see again.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.101
I guess my biggest fear
is that this baby's

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.520
gonna grow up not knowing
who its father is.

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:32.406
Rorry,

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.616
has anyone ever taught you

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:37.911
about the two basic
choices that humans

01:06:37.953 --> 01:06:39.496
have before them?

01:06:45.711 --> 01:06:47.629
The first is fear.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.673
The other is faith.

01:06:49.715 --> 01:06:53.635
The hardest part is
knowin' what to fear

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:56.304
and where to put your faith.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.514
- I like that.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:06.481
Fear and
faith cannot exist
in the same thought.

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:10.986
Try to replace the
fear-based thoughts

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.238
with faith-based thoughts.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.576
A dear friend of mine told me

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.703
that we can all turn a mess

01:07:20.996 --> 01:07:22.956
into a message.

01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:25.584
And our test into a testimonial.

01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:32.382
I believe something
good is coming your way.

01:07:32.424 --> 01:07:34.676
- That just sounds like
I'd be lying to myself.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.303
No, no, no.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:37.512
Fear is the lie.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:46.521
Don't let time get
away from you, Rorry.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.108
Every moment of every
day is a gift from God.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:03.121
- Bye, Charlie.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.250
Rorry,

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:09.961
I want to give you something.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:13.173
Remember that the past
only holds onto you

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:17.010
if you don't know where
you'll spend eternity.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:23.558
Simply have the faith that
your father loves you,

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.813
and that he has a way to
redeem your relationships.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:30.649
- Thank you.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.359
I'll never forget that.

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:34.528
Bye, Charlie.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:00.053
Thank you, Charlie.

01:09:28.415 --> 01:09:29.791
- Yeah, I'll be
there shortly, honey.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.751
I.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:33.169
No, I, I gotta go.

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:34.837
Come in.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.091
You okay?

01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:40.010
- Yeah, um,

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.638
you're right, Doctor.

01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:46.057
We are lucky.

01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:48.810
I do think it was more
than just a coincidence

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.770
that our paths crossed.

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:53.481
- Yeah, maybe.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.569
- I told you about the old man

01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:59.321
who helped me in the parking
lot of the bar, right?

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.740
Yeah, you did.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.658
- He gave me something.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.746
He gave me this wristwatch.

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:10.123
- Okay.

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:10.957
- And

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:16.087
I think I'm supposed
to give it to you.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:18.632
- Uh, I appreciate
the gesture, Brandon.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:20.842
I have several wristwatches.

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:23.803
You should keep it.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:25.889
- No.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.769
It's yours now.

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:36.816
Do what you want with it.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:38.818
But I can't leave with it.

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:46.785
Thanks again, Dr. Phillips.

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:49.079
- Take care, Brandon.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:49.913
- You too.

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.822
Gemma, it's your brother.

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:26.908
Your strong brother.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:34.416
I just want you to know I
turned myself into the Army.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.709
I don't know what's gonna happen

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.753
but I know it's the
right thing to do.

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:43.967
I love you

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:46.928
and I'll be in touch.

01:11:58.857 --> 01:12:03.028
Come on,
Uncle Keith, pick up.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.113
Please.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.541
Help!

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:39.322
Brandon?

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.367
What are you doing here?

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.951
- I was in an accident.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.373
- Yeah, no, this doctor, he...

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.751
It's complicated.

01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:54.128
My uncle's
a doctor here.

01:17:57.382 --> 01:17:58.257
Dr. Phillips?

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:00.510
Whoa.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.554
That's my uncle.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:07.016
- Um, do you wanna
grab a cup of coffee?

01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:09.852
- I'd love to.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.896
I have something
important to tell you.

01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:14.148
- Okay, yeah, um.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.650
I'll be right here.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:29.330
Uncle Keith?

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:31.290
- Rorry.

01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:37.338
I'm so glad you're
here, come in, come in.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:41.300
I'm so, so sorry for the
hurtful things I said.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.264
I'm so glad you're here.

01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:49.016
- Nothin'.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.393
Nothin' at all.

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.106
- I think I left my wallet here.

01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:56.441
- You did.

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:57.275
You did.

01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:01.195
I got it.
- That's it.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:05.533
- Rorry, there's somethin'
else I wanna say, too.

01:19:05.575 --> 01:19:07.201
Besides being sorry,

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.704
I, I want you to
know your Aunt Karen

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:12.331
is, is, is gonna pass away soon,

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.418
and I, I've been lost.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:19.755
And, and I, and I
didn't think I could

01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:22.091
go another day without her.

01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:26.929
I didn't wanna go
another day without her.

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:29.390
And, uh, and then I realized

01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:34.228
that there's a better place,
