00:02.866 --> 00:04.159
All right!

00:04.367 --> 00:08.037
Yes! From home to the hospital
in seven minutes!

00:08.246 --> 00:11.541
Yes. The hard part is truly over.

00:12.041 --> 00:15.003
We're off to a great start, aren't we?

00:15.170 --> 00:18.882
I knew I'd get here fast,
but this has to be a record!

00:19.174 --> 00:22.302
- Oh, you made it!
- Hi.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.598
- How the hell did you beat us here?
- We took a cab. Did you walk?

00:27.640 --> 00:30.685
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs...

00:30.852 --> 00:33.188
- Hi.
- Hey, you made it!

00:34.189 --> 00:38.276
Okay, is there some kind of magic
tunnel to this hospital?

00:38.693 --> 00:42.572
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.

00:42.780 --> 00:47.827
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Green.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.

00:47.994 --> 00:51.039
We have a semi-private
labor room waiting...

00:51.206 --> 00:56.711
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.

00:56.878 --> 01:01.174
Yes, I see that here.
We can't guarantee a private room.

01:01.341 --> 01:06.930
- Currently, they're all unavailable.
- Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

01:07.180 --> 01:10.767
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms
are all we have.

01:10.934 --> 01:14.687
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

01:16.064 --> 01:17.065
Yeah?

01:17.232 --> 01:21.611
- Give her some money.
- I really think they're out of rooms.

01:21.819 --> 01:26.616
They're saving them for important
people! What if I was the president?

01:26.866 --> 01:29.994
We'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.

01:32.413 --> 01:33.915
Okay.

01:34.582 --> 01:38.211
Say, would you mind checking again?

01:38.419 --> 01:42.757
See if any, uh, private rooms
may have opened up?

01:43.758 --> 01:45.760
This is a hospital.

01:45.969 --> 01:49.430
You know what?
I don't really care for your tone.

01:49.597 --> 01:55.478
This is not the only hospital in the city.
We have no problem... Whoa. Oh, gosh!

01:55.645 --> 01:57.480
- What, what?
- Contraction! Ow! Ow!

01:57.647 --> 02:01.109
- Oh!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ooh, ooh.

02:01.359 --> 02:04.696
- Like to see a semi-private room?
- Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

02:44.319 --> 02:48.031
You're 2 centimeters dilated.
We need to get to 10.

02:48.239 --> 02:50.325
- It will be a while.
- Oh, okay.

02:50.491 --> 02:54.662
- I'll be back in an hour to check on you.
- Thank you.

02:55.371 --> 02:59.667
- I guess we have some time to kill.
- Yeah, guess so.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.670
- Oh, check these out.
- Oh.

03:10.345 --> 03:13.139
Never done this before.

03:13.389 --> 03:15.642
Yeah, well, it looks great.

03:17.268 --> 03:21.397
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to...

03:27.904 --> 03:32.867
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin
this magical day for you.

03:33.034 --> 03:36.371
- Not at all. Marc Horger. My wife, Julie.
- Don't worry about it.

03:36.537 --> 03:39.707
- Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
- Oh, hi, Rachel.

03:39.874 --> 03:42.085
- Is this your first?
- It is.

03:42.251 --> 03:45.046
- Well, little Jamie here is our third.
- Wow.

03:45.213 --> 03:48.675
So if you have any questions,
just holler.

03:48.883 --> 03:51.803
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

03:53.429 --> 03:58.101
- Let me give you guys some privacy.
- Nonsense. We're all in this together.

03:58.267 --> 04:02.230
We are gonna share every
moment of this with you.

04:02.397 --> 04:06.234
- I think we're gonna have some fun.
- Yeah.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.736
- Oh, okay, I guess.
- Hey, smile!

04:08.903 --> 04:10.947
- No.
- I really don't want any...

04:11.197 --> 04:12.281
Oh, thank you.

04:13.574 --> 04:16.160
Oh, Ross.
Here comes another contraction.

04:16.327 --> 04:19.122
- Ooh, ooh, ooh...
- Okay, just breathe...

04:19.329 --> 04:22.917
- Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
- Oh, my God!

04:23.084 --> 04:26.170
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, oh, oh.

04:26.337 --> 04:31.092
- Hey, look at this. Here you go!
- Oh, no!

04:36.764 --> 04:39.434
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

04:39.642 --> 04:44.230
Ugh, the miracle of birth
sure is a snooze-fest.

04:46.107 --> 04:50.027
- Hey, you wanna see something?
- Sure. What?

04:50.278 --> 04:53.448
This will be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.

04:53.614 --> 04:55.700
- Honey?
- Yeah?

04:55.867 --> 04:58.995
Listen, uh, I've been doing
some thinking...

04:59.245 --> 05:03.291
...and I don't know whether
it's because we're here...

05:03.458 --> 05:06.169
...or Rachel's giving birth...

05:06.335 --> 05:10.298
...but, um, I think we should
try to have a baby.

05:13.968 --> 05:15.845
Okay.

05:17.805 --> 05:18.973
What's that now?

05:19.807 --> 05:22.685
Okay. I've been thinking about it too.
I think we're ready.

05:26.272 --> 05:29.901
Are you kidding? You think
we're ready to have a baby?

05:30.151 --> 05:31.527
Oh, this is fun.

05:33.654 --> 05:37.533
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!

05:37.700 --> 05:39.368
You said you were ready.

05:39.535 --> 05:43.831
I was screwing with you to get
your voice high and weird...

05:43.998 --> 05:45.333
...like mine is now!

05:45.833 --> 05:48.711
Yes, but haven't you
wanted a kid forever?

05:48.920 --> 05:51.547
Okay, just back oh', mister!

05:53.674 --> 05:56.677
Because I am ready to have a baby.

05:56.844 --> 05:58.179
I just want Joey to be the father.

06:00.181 --> 06:03.726
- What? Are you crazy?
- Right there! That's all I wanted!

06:06.229 --> 06:10.107
I'm sorry. The doctor insisted
on closing the curtain for the exam.

06:10.942 --> 06:14.237
Oh, that's very...
Really, very, very okay.

06:14.445 --> 06:19.325
Julie's cervix is dilated 7 centimeters.
That's about four fingers!

06:20.868 --> 06:24.205
- Doctor let me feel it.
- Have you felt Rachel's?

06:24.413 --> 06:27.708
- No, I don't...
- We won't be doing that.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.795
Well, you could feel Rachel's,
then feel mine to compare.

06:32.547 --> 06:35.091
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes! Thank you!

06:35.258 --> 06:37.260
- No, no...
- Later.

06:37.468 --> 06:40.096
- You can't leave me with them.
- Sorry.

06:40.263 --> 06:45.268
No, Ross, Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!

06:45.434 --> 06:51.065
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna
be a while. I wish you'd called first.

06:51.274 --> 06:53.901
- I'm coming back later with your father.
- Oh, good.

06:54.068 --> 06:58.239
- I need to talk to you before the birth.
- Okay. What's up?

06:58.406 --> 07:01.325
I brought something
that I want to give you.

07:01.492 --> 07:04.787
Assuming, of course, that you want it.

07:05.454 --> 07:08.624
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?

07:09.750 --> 07:14.130
Your grandma's engagement ring,
I want you to give it to Rachel.

07:14.380 --> 07:17.842
- Mom, no. Come on. Thank you...
- Just hear me out...

07:18.009 --> 07:22.597
No! Okay? We're not getting
married because she's pregnant.

07:22.763 --> 07:29.437
Honestly, this isn't just some girl
you picked up in a bar and humped.

07:31.981 --> 07:33.941
A child should have a family.

07:34.150 --> 07:36.819
I can't deal with this now. I'm sorry.

07:36.986 --> 07:40.990
Think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.

07:41.198 --> 07:43.034
Give me that.

07:43.618 --> 07:47.038
- Hi, dear.
- Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

07:47.288 --> 07:49.040
Ross, get in here!

07:53.920 --> 07:57.465
She dragged me out of the labor room
to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.

07:57.798 --> 07:59.926
Yeah.

08:00.343 --> 08:04.472
- Why aren't you with Rachel?
- Are you kidding?

08:04.639 --> 08:08.559
We're not gonna be together
because we're having a baby.

08:08.809 --> 08:11.020
It seems you belong together.

08:11.187 --> 08:15.191
I can't deal with this right now.
I have to go have a baby.

08:15.441 --> 08:17.985
Right. And with who again?

08:19.070 --> 08:22.531
He's crazy. Why doesn't
he wanna be with Rachel?

08:22.740 --> 08:23.824
I know.

08:23.991 --> 08:28.371
She's like the perfect woman.
I know she turned me down...

08:28.537 --> 08:33.876
...but if she wanted to be with me,
I would take her in my arms and...

08:37.462 --> 08:40.256
I haven't bummed you guys out
like this in a while.

08:44.971 --> 08:46.263
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:46.472 --> 08:49.058
- Who's that?
- New people.

08:50.893 --> 08:53.104
What happened to the Disgustingtons?

08:53.854 --> 08:59.235
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!

08:59.402 --> 09:02.071
After you left, they wheeled her off.

09:02.238 --> 09:08.411
Not before she gave me a nice, juicy
shot of little Jamie, crowning away.

09:08.619 --> 09:10.204
- Wow. Sorry.
- Ugh.

09:10.371 --> 09:13.040
So, uh, how are the new people?

09:13.249 --> 09:16.961
Well, they have some unusual
pet names for each other.

09:17.128 --> 09:22.425
Including, um, "Evil Bitch"
and, uh, "Sick Bastard."

09:23.884 --> 09:28.556
- Oh, gosh, a contraction. Ooh, ow!
- Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.

09:28.723 --> 09:30.725
- Are you looking at her?
- No!

09:30.933 --> 09:36.147
- Don't look at her, you sick bastard!
- I swear I wasn't looking at her!

09:36.397 --> 09:40.067
She's in labor. You like that,
you sick son of a bitch?

09:44.405 --> 09:45.614
I'm just gonna...

09:45.781 --> 09:48.993
See? It's because you were looking,
you fat pervert.

09:49.785 --> 09:53.831
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.

09:57.793 --> 09:59.670
You miss your girlfriend?

10:00.963 --> 10:03.799
- Just ignore them.
- Ugh.

10:04.050 --> 10:06.469
- You okay?
- Yeah.

10:11.098 --> 10:12.266
- Ross.
- What?

10:12.433 --> 10:16.103
- He's looking at me.
- Hey!

10:16.270 --> 10:18.189
Wanna live to see your baby?

10:18.439 --> 10:21.859
Don't you talk to my husband like that,
you stupid bastard!

10:26.614 --> 10:30.117
Oh, good God! If you want
a baby so bad, just go steal it!

10:33.287 --> 10:36.582
Since when are you
so crazy about babies?

10:36.791 --> 10:41.128
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.

10:42.838 --> 10:43.881
What?

10:44.131 --> 10:47.885
We talk about having
babies someday, not now...

10:48.094 --> 10:53.307
...but I'm starting to think that we
can handle it. We're good.

10:53.474 --> 10:56.143
We're really good.

10:56.977 --> 10:58.646
We are pretty good.

10:58.813 --> 11:01.107
But nothing has to happen
until you're ready.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.694
Well, maybe I'm ready now.

11:05.903 --> 11:09.907
I mean, it's a little scary,
but maybe it's right.

11:10.157 --> 11:13.160
It's not right!
We're not ready for a kid!

11:13.494 --> 11:16.580
- What?
- I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.

11:19.333 --> 11:23.170
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?

11:23.379 --> 11:25.214
We're trying to get pregnant.

11:26.423 --> 11:28.217
Mm.

11:30.219 --> 11:33.889
I'm not comfortable doing
this in front of the babies.

11:34.140 --> 11:39.520
- So when do you want to start trying?
- All right, hold on a sec.

11:39.854 --> 11:42.523
- Period math?
- Yeah.

11:44.191 --> 11:47.444
Well, we could start trying now.

11:47.862 --> 11:52.283
- Right here?
- No, not here.

11:52.449 --> 11:54.118
Maybe here.

11:55.035 --> 11:59.206
We got time to kill.
We're in a building that's full of beds!

11:59.415 --> 12:00.624
And it's so clean!

12:08.007 --> 12:11.051
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!

12:11.218 --> 12:15.097
- Aw, it ate your money?
- No.

12:18.309 --> 12:20.603
- I'll see you downstairs then.
- All right.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.438
All right.

12:22.771 --> 12:25.649
Hey, I got one! I got one!

12:28.527 --> 12:29.570
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:29.737 --> 12:33.407
- Oh, up or down'?
- Oh. Down, please.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.787
I hate to be a ball-buster,
but can I just do it?

12:42.541 --> 12:45.127
- Could you press up too?
- Sure.

12:46.670 --> 12:50.966
- I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
- How did yours happen?

12:51.175 --> 12:53.594
It's a long, embarrassing story.

12:53.761 --> 12:57.848
Let's just say, there was a
typographical error with a sex manual.

12:59.934 --> 13:01.685
- How about you?
- Car accident.

13:01.936 --> 13:06.690
- Idiot on a cell not paying attention?
- Yeah. Me.

13:08.734 --> 13:11.779
- Oh, hey, that's me.
- Okay.

13:12.488 --> 13:14.657
Hey, uh, I take it you're
just visiting someone.

13:14.865 --> 13:15.908
Uh-huh. Yeah.

13:16.075 --> 13:20.246
Well, um, if you have some time,
and you wanna visit someone else...

13:20.496 --> 13:22.206
Yeah. I would like that.

13:22.373 --> 13:28.170
- Great. I'm in room...
- Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!

13:28.379 --> 13:30.798
You gotta press the button.

13:35.010 --> 13:36.971
They're bringing in another woman.

13:37.137 --> 13:40.182
Ugh. Is she pregnant yet?

13:40.391 --> 13:44.979
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.

13:45.145 --> 13:48.816
- Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
- Oh, okay. Here, here.

13:48.983 --> 13:52.695
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ow, ooh, ow!
- That's it.

13:52.861 --> 13:57.366
- Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
- Yeah, it was.

13:57.574 --> 14:00.911
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.

14:01.078 --> 14:04.540
Mm, mm.

14:07.126 --> 14:09.586
Oh, that was a big one.

14:15.301 --> 14:19.722
Could you help me'? The patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.

14:19.888 --> 14:24.268
He's in a wheelchair.
He's early to mid-30$, very attractive.

14:24.518 --> 14:29.064
- I know who you're talking about.
- Yay! Great! What room is he in?

14:29.273 --> 14:32.067
Sorry. That information is restricted.

14:32.234 --> 14:37.906
- She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
- Dr. Drake who?

14:38.115 --> 14:43.746
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.

14:44.038 --> 14:48.042
- At this hospital?
- Damn it! We're losing precious time.

14:48.208 --> 14:49.960
You want this man's blood
on your head...

14:50.127 --> 14:52.421
- Hands.
- Hands.

14:52.588 --> 14:57.509
It is essential that you tell me
what room he is staying in.

14:57.676 --> 14:59.887
He's a patient of mine.

15:00.095 --> 15:02.639
- He's in room 816.
- 816. Thank you.

15:02.806 --> 15:05.601
- And what is his name?
- No.

15:15.652 --> 15:19.073
- I think we found a place.
- Okay.

15:21.825 --> 15:25.120
- Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
- Okay.

15:25.287 --> 15:27.831
- We'll dim the lights.
- Okay.

15:27.998 --> 15:31.001
Or turn them out altogether.

15:31.919 --> 15:36.215
Uh, no scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.

15:36.382 --> 15:40.135
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.

15:44.390 --> 15:47.893
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?

15:49.686 --> 15:51.605
Oh, right! Ha, ha.

15:59.405 --> 16:02.366
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.

16:06.036 --> 16:07.329
Ooh, this is it!

16:08.455 --> 16:11.125
- That's him!
- Great. Go get him!

16:11.834 --> 16:15.003
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.

16:15.921 --> 16:17.548
He's not really my type.

16:18.632 --> 16:22.928
Not you. Dr. Ramoray.
Ask him questions and see what he's like.

16:23.137 --> 16:26.723
- People tell doctors everything.
- You said he's great.

16:26.932 --> 16:31.353
Guys I meet seem nice at first,
then turn out to be big jerks.

16:31.562 --> 16:34.815
- You do attract some stinkers.
- I know.

16:35.774 --> 16:39.319
Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.

16:39.486 --> 16:42.072
Three women have had their babies.

16:42.281 --> 16:46.994
Give me good news. How many
centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?

16:47.161 --> 16:49.329
- Three.
- Just 3?

16:49.538 --> 16:51.915
I'm dilated 3!

16:53.959 --> 16:58.380
We are moving along slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.

16:58.547 --> 17:01.967
- I'll be back soon.
- Thank you.

17:03.677 --> 17:06.930
I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.

17:07.097 --> 17:12.019
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?

17:12.560 --> 17:18.275
- Actually, it's more like this.
- Oh, stupid metric system.

17:19.358 --> 17:21.612
Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:21.944 --> 17:24.990
We'll take you straight
to the delivery room.

17:25.199 --> 17:28.911
Oh, for the love of God!

17:30.037 --> 17:35.042
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few
routine questions I need to ask you.

17:35.959 --> 17:38.253
I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.

17:38.462 --> 17:41.548
I know. I'm a neurologist.
To be safe...

17:41.715 --> 17:46.803
...Dr. Wells wanted a more
comprehensive overview. So he sent me.

17:47.221 --> 17:48.972
Dr. Wells is a woman.

17:50.891 --> 17:53.852
That was a test. Good response.

17:55.437 --> 17:58.732
- All right. Uh, full name?
- Clifford Burnett.

17:58.899 --> 18:02.236
- Date of birth?
- November 16, 1968.

18:02.402 --> 18:03.654
Age?

18:05.239 --> 18:10.661
- Can't you figure that out?
- I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.

18:11.662 --> 18:14.540
- I'm 33.
- Okay.

18:15.499 --> 18:17.876
- And, uh, are you married?
- No.

18:18.085 --> 18:24.758
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would
you say you have commitment issues?

18:26.051 --> 18:29.096
Are all the questions this personal?

18:29.263 --> 18:30.806
Yes.

18:32.015 --> 18:35.269
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.

18:35.435 --> 18:39.481
- Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

18:39.940 --> 18:43.235
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

18:45.279 --> 18:47.155
- No.
- Excellent. Excellent.

18:47.322 --> 18:51.577
And, uh, finally, are you into any weird
stuff, you know, sexually?

18:53.870 --> 18:56.373
- No!
- Ooh. Wrong answer.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.920
- What else? What else?
- Uh, he's 33.

19:02.087 --> 19:03.130
Uh-huh.

19:03.297 --> 19:04.548
- A widower.
- Oh.

19:04.798 --> 19:09.052
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.

19:11.430 --> 19:12.889
Enter Pheebs.

19:16.476 --> 19:19.980
- This room's available.
- Okay! Wait, listen to me!

19:20.147 --> 19:22.608
Since I've been waiting,
four women...

19:22.816 --> 19:26.445
...one higher than the centimeters
I'm dilated...

19:26.612 --> 19:31.950
...have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. My turn. It's only fair.

19:32.117 --> 19:36.246
If you bring in one more woman who has
her baby before me, I will sue you.

19:37.623 --> 19:41.918
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.

19:42.085 --> 19:45.922
- Uh, Rach?
- You get back on that case, honey!

19:46.131 --> 19:49.176
I don't think the next
patient is far along.

19:49.384 --> 19:52.971
Okay. Well, then bring her in.

20:01.146 --> 20:06.568
Oh, my God!

20:20.207 --> 20:24.211
I can't believe this!

20:25.754 --> 20:28.882
And yet, somehow, it's true.

20:31.051 --> 20:35.472
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!

20:37.766 --> 20:41.186
Squeeze your legs together,
cover the baby's ears.

20:41.561 --> 20:44.815
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi, sweetheart.

20:44.981 --> 20:48.735
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think
you've met. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.

20:48.902 --> 20:54.700
I nabbed him at the dermatologist's.
Thank God for adult acne!

20:54.908 --> 20:57.953
I can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

20:58.995 --> 21:00.831
Really?

21:01.832 --> 21:02.916
What did he say?

21:03.125 --> 21:06.962
You have to speak loudly,
he's almost completely deaf.

21:07.170 --> 21:10.590
- Oh, there you go.
- Of course he is.

21:10.757 --> 21:14.761
Congratulations.
I didn't even know you got married.

21:15.011 --> 21:16.596
- Oh, no. We didn't.
- No, no, we...

21:16.805 --> 21:18.181
What?

21:18.432 --> 21:22.894
We're just having this baby together,
but, uh, that's all. You know?

21:24.020 --> 21:25.814
Why?

21:27.441 --> 21:34.322
Uh, we're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.

21:34.531 --> 21:37.367
Oh. Well, then shut me up.

21:38.452 --> 21:39.494
Just tell me how.

21:41.455 --> 21:43.707
Uh-oh. Oh, I feel another one coming.

21:43.874 --> 21:48.879
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh!
