to fix his ceiling fan,

3A doesn't know my name?

Where'd the fancy cookies
come from?

00:28.985 --> 00:30.769
I swiped 'em from Adam's.

night, so I figured he owed me.

Carob?

No.

Carob's more like
crappy chocolate.

at the restaurant all the time.

the chef de-glute it myself.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.338
What is gluten anyway?

01:17.381 --> 01:19.340
If I'm not mistaken,
it's a chemical compound

of the wheat plant,

Wait, wait, wait, you're not
breaking up with me, are you?

11:52.799 --> 11:54.757
Is he breaking up
with you on the phone?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.759
That is messed up, Adam!

11:56.803 --> 11:59.022
I'm not breaking up with you.
Just-just stay put.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.197
I'll be right there.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.243
Okay. Bye.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.506
What's going on?

12:04.549 --> 12:06.290
Adam's breaking up with me.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.207
This sounds like a job
for skipping.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.731
Uh-huh.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.780
I guess we're skipping now.

12:17.824 --> 12:18.955
Let's go.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.965
[recorded]:
Hi, this is Bonnie Plunkett.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.576
My patience is limited. Go.[beep]

12:31.620 --> 12:33.970
Bonnie, it's Adam.
You weren't at the restaurant.

12:34.014 --> 12:37.713
Where are you?
Please, please call me back.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.584
BONNIE:
Eat my dust!

12:39.628 --> 12:41.891
CHRISTY: Oh,
come on, wait up!

12:47.897 --> 12:50.682
Oh, dear God.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.162
[whooping, laughing]

12:52.206 --> 12:54.251
You know, I learned how
to masturbate on one of these.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.426
[laughs]

12:55.470 --> 12:57.907
When you were little?No, just now.

12:57.951 --> 13:01.302
[laughing]

13:03.608 --> 13:05.262
Bonnie.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.830
Oh, no, Adam's here.
Quick, everyone close your eyes

13:07.874 --> 13:08.875
so he can't see me.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.572
Can't see me.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.574
Honey,

13:12.617 --> 13:14.794
honey, we need to talk.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.318
Don't break up with my mom.
She loves you.

13:17.361 --> 13:18.710
And you make her nicer!

13:18.754 --> 13:20.451
And she loves you!

13:20.495 --> 13:22.279
I'm not here to break up
with you,

13:22.323 --> 13:24.934
but we do need to talk. Alone.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.937
Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh...

13:27.981 --> 13:32.159
Jill, hold on to her horse
so it doesn't get away.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.686
So we're okay?

13:37.729 --> 13:39.644
I am.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.646
Honey, listen...

13:41.690 --> 13:44.867
Mm-mm. Time-out.

13:44.911 --> 13:49.089
Are you sure? The little horse
already did half the work.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.221
There's something
that I have to tell you.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.876
Okay, but, first, I want
to tell you something.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.226
Christy and I have decided

13:56.270 --> 13:59.055
that you and I are
gonna get married.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.145
I'm excited about it.

14:02.189 --> 14:04.017
She's still struggling.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.454
Let's put a pin in that.

14:06.497 --> 14:09.022
Here's the thing...

14:09.065 --> 14:10.240
the cookies you took
from my house

14:10.284 --> 14:11.502
were filled with pot.

14:13.765 --> 14:14.897
What?

14:14.941 --> 14:16.725
Yeah.

14:16.768 --> 14:20.555
No. That's not possible.

14:20.598 --> 14:25.081
I know what pot tastes like and
those did not taste like pot.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.778
Maybe carob.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.998
I'm really sorry, babe.
I really am.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.653
[sighs]
No!

14:31.696 --> 14:32.828
You've got to be wrong.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.917
There's no way.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.963
[whooping, cheering]

14:37.006 --> 14:40.749
[laughing]

14:40.792 --> 14:44.274
Oh, my God, we're totally high.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.582
[cheering, laughing]

14:51.629 --> 14:53.153
I can't believe this.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.677
Three years of sobriety erased,
just like that.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.375
I had five years
and seven months!

14:58.419 --> 15:01.596
[laughs]

15:01.639 --> 15:05.730
Do you guys realize that
we relapsed in our AA meeting?

15:05.774 --> 15:07.123
[cackles]

15:07.167 --> 15:08.646
How can you be
laughing right now?

15:08.690 --> 15:10.213
I don't know.

15:10.257 --> 15:14.087
I'm trying to cry,
but this is what's happening.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.958
This is all your fault!

15:16.002 --> 15:17.264
What did I do?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.961
You knew what
those cookies were.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.963
You just wanted to get high
and take us down with you!

15:21.007 --> 15:22.878
Are you out of your mind?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.358
You honestly think
I would do that

15:24.401 --> 15:26.490
to my daughter,
to my friends?

15:26.534 --> 15:28.492
I think you're
capable of anything!

15:28.536 --> 15:30.190
I don't even know
your real name!

15:30.233 --> 15:33.193
Let me tell you something:
if I was gonna relapse,

15:33.236 --> 15:35.586
I wouldn't do it
on something as lame as pot!

15:35.630 --> 15:37.371
And I certainly
wouldn't share!

15:37.414 --> 15:39.721
All right, everybody
just take a deep breath.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.331
Everything's
gonna be fine.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.246
And what the hell
is wrong with you?

15:43.290 --> 15:45.292
How do you leave drugs around
when you're dating an addict?

15:45.335 --> 15:46.728
I didn't leave them around.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.252
They were in the cabinet
behind my pots and pans!

15:49.296 --> 15:50.340
I thought
you hid them there

15:50.384 --> 15:51.472
'cause you didn't
want me to eat them.

15:51.515 --> 15:52.777
I didn't want you
to eat them!

15:54.214 --> 15:56.216
I'm gonna have to go
back to rehab.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.392
At least you can afford rehab!

15:58.435 --> 15:59.741
You know what,
in a couple hours

15:59.784 --> 16:00.916
this is all
gonna be over,

16:00.960 --> 16:02.918
let's all just
calm down.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.485
Don't tell us to calm down!

16:04.528 --> 16:06.095
You don't know
what we just lost

16:06.139 --> 16:08.097
or how hard it's gonna
be to start over!

16:08.141 --> 16:09.490
So just shut up!

16:09.533 --> 16:10.534
Shut up!

16:10.578 --> 16:12.493
I'm sorry.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.932
I think
we're being followed.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.849
Thank you for coming.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.721
I'm in way over my head.

16:23.765 --> 16:24.853
No problem.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.159
Little problem.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.421
We were in the middle
of a romantic dinner.

16:27.464 --> 16:28.596
Victor, please.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.990
I already took the pill,
now it's wasted.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.169
Hi, girls. How we doing?

16:36.212 --> 16:38.214
Bad. Really bad.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.738
I begged you not to
answer your phone.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.176
Go make coffee.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.829
Happy anniversary to me.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.050
Marjorie, I'm really high

16:48.094 --> 16:49.660
and I'm scared
it's never gonna end.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.053
I'm scared
I'm gonna lose my job.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.446
They drug test us!

16:52.489 --> 16:55.057
We lost our sobriety.
We all have to start over.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.624
Okay, let's calm down.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.842
Don't say "calm down."

16:57.886 --> 17:00.497
Christy does not like
"calm down."

17:00.541 --> 17:02.195
Go help with the coffee.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.718
Yes, ma'am.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.895
Okay, now,
none of you had any idea

17:06.938 --> 17:08.636
there was pot in
those cookies, right?

17:09.897 --> 17:12.248
Right!

17:12.291 --> 17:14.685
So, this was
an accident.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.297
This was not a
choice anybody made.

17:17.339 --> 17:20.387
Therefore, no one has
lost their sobriety.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.780
I sure feel like I lost it.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.565
It feels like a death
in the family.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.045
Sugar or Splenda?

17:27.872 --> 17:30.266
I'll just bring both.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.488
Look, this sort of thing
happens.

17:34.531 --> 17:37.926
I had 11 years, I was
on a cruise to Mexico,

17:37.969 --> 17:39.971
I ordered a virgin
piña colada,

17:40.015 --> 17:42.191
I took a big gulp
and realized

17:42.235 --> 17:44.019
it was as much a
virgin as I was.

17:45.586 --> 17:46.630
So what did you do?

17:46.674 --> 17:48.110
I called the waitress

17:48.154 --> 17:49.677
an unfortunate name--

17:49.720 --> 17:52.245
a series of
names, really--

17:52.288 --> 17:53.463
[clears throat]

17:53.507 --> 17:55.248
but I didn't take
another sip.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.338
And that was it?
You didn't beat yourself up?

17:58.381 --> 18:01.080
What for? It
was an accident.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.343
I did try to make
amends to the waitress,

18:03.386 --> 18:07.129
but she was so shook up,
she jumped ship in Cancun.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.437
What if I wake up tomorrow
and I want to use?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.569
Then you call me, you
go to your meetings,

18:12.613 --> 18:15.355
you do what you've been doing
for the past three years.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.227
I'm still so sad
that this happened.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.837
Well that's
a good thing.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.275
It shows how much your
sobriety means to you.

18:22.318 --> 18:25.321
Christy, you're
gonna be okay.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.323
Thanks, Marjorie.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.157
Bad news, Jill.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.159
Marjorie has
the most awesome hands.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.293
How is that possible?
Let me see!

18:41.511 --> 18:43.339
You all right?

18:43.383 --> 18:45.820
Been better.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.257
Sure different
than it used to be.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.606
Yeah.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.349
I did like you teaching
me how to skip.

18:53.393 --> 18:54.698
I liked it, too.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.398
I'm sorry I blamed you
for what happened.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.096
Thank you.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.881
But in all fairness,
it is your fault.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.191
[grunts]

19:09.235 --> 19:11.280
Who the hell is June?

19:17.982 --> 19:20.202
So how are the girls?

19:20.246 --> 19:23.510
Good. We went to three meetings
in the last 24 hours.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.207
We cried about it
at the first meeting,

19:25.251 --> 19:27.078
laughed about it at the second,
and by the third,

19:27.122 --> 19:28.906
we were back
to bitching about men.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.430
[laughs]

19:30.473 --> 19:31.518
That wasn't a joke.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.740
Again, I am so sorry.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.307
It's okay.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.091
I love you.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.224
I love you, too.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.315
Hey, one other thing.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.143
When we were in the park
the other night,

19:48.187 --> 19:51.842
you said something
about our relationship that--

19:51.886 --> 19:53.931
it kind of caught me off guard
a little bit.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.498
Did I?

19:57.631 --> 19:59.546
You did.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.678
Hmm.

20:01.722 --> 20:05.116
Well, I was pretty high.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.641
You say things when you're high.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.425
It doesn't mean anything.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.778
Okay.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.084
Then it's forgotten.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.172
Good.
Yeah.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.260
You want to watch TV?

20:18.304 --> 20:19.566
I do. I mean, sure.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.313
Stupid pot.
