WEBVTT

00:00.246 --> 00:01.492
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

00:01.492 --> 00:03.144
Got 12 dead mexicans slaughtered

00:03.145 --> 00:04.605
in their house in San Marcos.

00:04.804 --> 00:05.740
But no arrests.

00:05.741 --> 00:06.616
I'll make some calls.

00:06.617 --> 00:09.577
A name keeps popping up
in my interviews. Hernan.

00:09.578 --> 00:11.949
Hernan is undercover in
the salvadoran organization.

00:11.950 --> 00:13.555
Stop trying to contact him.

00:13.556 --> 00:14.967
Hey, Moses!
I thought we told you

00:14.968 --> 00:16.554
to stay away from between her pussy.

00:16.555 --> 00:17.807
You're gonna stop seeing that asshole.

00:17.808 --> 00:18.808
I know.

00:20.118 --> 00:21.494
So this guy targets runaways.

00:21.495 --> 00:23.161
While telling them to go home.

00:23.431 --> 00:25.304
There's another girl.
Came in 6 months ago.

00:25.305 --> 00:26.306
We didn't believe her.

00:26.307 --> 00:28.868
Congratulations on getting
another girl ass raped.

00:28.869 --> 00:31.184
Anything you can tell us...
Where he held you?

00:31.185 --> 00:32.351
It was a girl's room.

00:32.464 --> 00:33.219
Posters on the wall

00:33.220 --> 00:35.865
were all white boys
in these gay poses.

00:35.866 --> 00:38.181
This Kevin Hiatt is ours
starting next week.

00:38.182 --> 00:39.742
You're not adding
anybody to my team

00:39.743 --> 00:41.054
that I don't have approval of.

00:41.055 --> 00:43.055
He's not your addition.
He's your replacement.

00:43.056 --> 00:45.680
Hiatt's decided to add another
member to the Strike Team.

00:45.681 --> 00:47.181
I suggested you.
All right.

00:47.369 --> 00:48.369
Shane?

00:49.745 --> 00:51.072
Lem, I'm sorry!

00:51.370 --> 00:52.699
But I had to, right?

00:52.897 --> 00:54.495
We're gonna find out who did this.

00:54.496 --> 00:55.414
And we're gonna kill him.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.173
It's Guardo.

00:56.263 --> 00:58.086
He stepped on his
protection plate twice.

00:58.696 --> 01:00.141
You know, maybe he didn't do it, man!

01:00.250 --> 01:01.704
If it wasn't Guardo, who was it?!

01:01.807 --> 01:03.195
Well, let's get him, man!

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.749 --> 01:28.187
Found him swirling in a gutter.

01:28.369 --> 01:29.182
Conscious?

01:29.183 --> 01:30.183
In and out.

01:30.495 --> 01:31.933
Contusions, possible fractures.

01:31.934 --> 01:32.934
Vitals are stable.

01:33.435 --> 01:34.401
Put him in curtain two.

01:34.402 --> 01:35.414
All right.

01:35.685 --> 01:38.055
Call the resident to check
for internal bleeding.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.369
Better tell him to hurry.

01:39.370 --> 01:40.620
Thought you said he was stable.

01:40.621 --> 01:42.009
He is, but we found this.

01:43.058 --> 01:44.058
He's a cop.

01:49.124 --> 01:49.973
Shane?

01:55.744 --> 01:57.521
Corrine, what the hell happened?

01:57.558 --> 01:59.746
He was beaten pretty badly
and doesn't remember how.

01:59.747 --> 02:00.747
Where? When?

02:00.748 --> 02:02.620
They found him a few blocks from here.

02:02.621 --> 02:03.746
Oh, man.

02:03.934 --> 02:05.120
No shit from you guys.

02:05.121 --> 02:06.809
Already took
one pounding today.

02:06.810 --> 02:07.694
What happened?

02:07.695 --> 02:09.573
I was walking to my truck,
next thing I know

02:09.574 --> 02:11.218
I'm coming to in a meat wagon.

02:11.219 --> 02:12.656
You didn't see anyone?

02:12.657 --> 02:14.060
Left my wallet.

02:14.561 --> 02:15.561
Badge, gun.

02:15.562 --> 02:17.372
Think it might've been the salvadorans?

02:17.373 --> 02:19.057
Some lame ass attempt at one of us?

02:19.058 --> 02:19.972
Payback for Guardo?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.533
We wouldn't be having
this conversation.

02:22.623 --> 02:25.289
This was just a good
old-fashioned shit-kicking.

02:25.501 --> 02:28.334
It was probably some asshole
we sent up, fresh out.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.370
I'll run down recent releases,
check in with the P.O.'s.

02:31.371 --> 02:32.815
Tell me something first...

02:33.124 --> 02:34.124
Who's this guy?

02:36.624 --> 02:39.558
New girlfriend likes baby
smooth skin between her thighs.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.114
You should have her call me.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.532
Oh, my god.

02:47.749 --> 02:48.749
What happened?

02:49.251 --> 02:50.624
What the doctors say?

02:50.625 --> 02:51.958
The X-rays are all good.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.184
I'll get working on who did this.

02:54.185 --> 02:55.685
Baby, what happened to you?

03:03.497 --> 03:05.575
<i>Transcript : Swsub.com</i>

03:05.781 --> 03:08.239
Synchro : Artusamak

03:08.475 --> 03:11.438
<i>Haunts</i>

03:14.149 --> 03:15.161
How's Shane doing?

03:15.533 --> 03:16.821
Hurting for certain.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.146
Not especially pleasing
to the eye at the moment.

03:19.147 --> 03:20.898
I'm going to post a protective detail

03:20.899 --> 03:22.834
outside his room until we know more.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.895
What do you know about
the San Marcos house murders?

03:24.896 --> 03:26.190
I heard about them.
Grisly stuff.

03:26.191 --> 03:27.898
Yeah.
Robbery homicide's running with it.

03:27.899 --> 03:30.399
We got the hand-off.
Aceveda's all over this.

03:30.838 --> 03:33.760
10 days ago my detective
found 12 bodies, hacked to pieces.

03:33.761 --> 03:35.349
Well, 11 bodies, one arm.

03:35.522 --> 03:37.458
Machete's the weapon of
choice for the salvadorans.

03:37.459 --> 03:40.147
Which supports the tip that
Aceveda's cronies gave us,

03:40.148 --> 03:42.021
that the killers were el salvadorians,

03:42.022 --> 03:43.896
the victims were all mexican illegals.

03:43.897 --> 03:44.897
3 women, 9 men.

03:45.583 --> 03:46.398
I.d.'s?

03:46.399 --> 03:47.334
All but the arm.

03:47.335 --> 03:48.898
Mexican government had
them in their system.

03:48.899 --> 03:50.335
If you can call that a system.

03:50.336 --> 03:51.774
The men were all from the same prison.

03:51.775 --> 03:53.349
Released 2 days before
the bodies were found.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.198
It's all in the there.

03:54.199 --> 03:56.586
This becomes
the Strike Team's top priority now.

03:56.587 --> 03:58.336
Solving it quickly
is the difference

03:58.337 --> 04:01.281
between keeping the barn
open or closing it for good.

04:01.525 --> 04:02.774
They're shutting
this place down?

04:02.775 --> 04:04.959
Not if you put a dozen murders
in the win column.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.587
Make our closure rate
too good-looking to lose us.

04:07.588 --> 04:09.588
Get with Dutch.
He found the bodies.

04:10.087 --> 04:12.975
Uh, the barn going out of
business stays between us.

04:13.900 --> 04:17.288
Last thing Farmington needs
is cops who feel like lame ducks.

04:19.036 --> 04:20.870
Alright. Let's have a look at it.

04:22.024 --> 04:23.024
Give me a sec?

04:25.462 --> 04:26.627
So far, no one on the street's bragging

04:26.628 --> 04:28.335
about giving Shane a beat down.

04:28.336 --> 04:31.711
All right. Well, have the units
keep their eyes and ears open.

04:31.712 --> 04:32.712
What, man?

04:33.520 --> 04:34.746
Guardo's girlfriend...

04:34.747 --> 04:36.087
She could've figured out we used her

04:36.088 --> 04:37.754
to get him, told his people...

04:38.337 --> 04:39.900
Maybe the salvadorans are after us.

04:39.901 --> 04:40.837
I don't think so, man.

04:40.838 --> 04:43.838
Shane got hit with a fist,
not a machete or a grenade.

04:44.399 --> 04:45.399
Let's go.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.622
RHD's pretty thorough.

04:48.838 --> 04:50.650
They give us a starting
place with the victims?

04:50.651 --> 04:51.527
Like she said.

04:51.528 --> 04:52.836
Released from a prison in Sinaloa.

04:52.837 --> 04:54.712
Connections to the same mexican cartel.

04:54.713 --> 04:56.268
All with guest worker visas.

04:56.836 --> 04:57.836
Let me see that.

04:58.652 --> 05:00.214
Prisoners don't get work visas.

05:00.215 --> 05:01.603
Especially not real ones.

05:01.778 --> 05:03.055
A- plus forgeries then.

05:04.403 --> 05:06.403
Where do you want me to start, jefe?

05:07.776 --> 05:08.901
It's either give you a hand

05:08.902 --> 05:10.624
or be out on the street, right?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.526
I've still got some drag at I.N.S.

05:13.527 --> 05:16.193
so I'll get them to run
a quick I.D. on the arm.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.088
But you know these streets
better than anyone.

05:19.089 --> 05:20.589
Where do you want to start?

05:20.777 --> 05:21.777
With the visas.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.653
You know anyone that does
that quality of work?

05:23.654 --> 05:24.709
I might know a guy.

05:25.654 --> 05:27.431
By the way, welcome to the team.

05:29.341 --> 05:30.396
Won't let you down.

05:30.651 --> 05:32.762
He's the boss now.
Don't let him down.

05:33.091 --> 05:34.091
Let's go.

05:36.217 --> 05:39.216
Graciela sanchez is getting
out of mission cross today.

05:39.463 --> 05:41.154
How are we doing iding her rapist?

05:41.155 --> 05:43.775
Billings is pounding the pavement
with the sketch Princess gave us.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.029
The feds are running
the profile I came up with

05:46.030 --> 05:47.716
through their database
for potential unsubs.

05:47.717 --> 05:49.652
Contact the local y's, teen shelters...

05:49.653 --> 05:51.339
I did it, I did it. No one's
gotten back to me yet.

05:51.340 --> 05:52.451
Stay on top of them.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.335
Our guy's M.O.'s escalating.

05:54.904 --> 05:55.778
Wouldn't surprise me

05:55.779 --> 05:57.723
if he's already got a fresh victim.

06:05.093 --> 06:06.093
Oh, my god.

06:11.841 --> 06:12.896
What are you doing?

06:12.969 --> 06:14.279
Details of the crime scene,

06:14.280 --> 06:16.840
create a written report
for the files on this case.

06:16.841 --> 06:18.354
Who wants what and why

06:18.552 --> 06:20.561
and how slaughtering
all those people in this room

06:20.868 --> 06:22.217
helped achieve that goal.

06:22.218 --> 06:24.341
That's all you need
to be writing down, man.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.456
Hey, hey.
I don't want to be here.

06:25.457 --> 06:26.396
Too bad.

06:27.469 --> 06:28.466
12 people.

06:28.467 --> 06:29.161
3 of them women.

06:29.162 --> 06:31.467
Cut to pieces in this place 10 days ago.

06:31.468 --> 06:32.466
I read about it in the paper.

06:32.467 --> 06:33.800
I didn't need to see it.

06:35.907 --> 06:37.295
They were carrying these.

06:38.657 --> 06:40.277
Only one guy I know
good enough to produce

06:40.282 --> 06:41.594
this kind of work and that's you.

06:41.595 --> 06:42.595
I changed careers.

06:42.966 --> 06:44.132
If not you, then who?

06:44.655 --> 06:45.655
I couldn't say.

06:46.845 --> 06:48.289
Paper men, we have a code.

06:48.412 --> 06:49.592
You got a code.

06:49.912 --> 06:51.716
You the blood on these walls? Huh?

06:51.717 --> 06:52.717
You see it?

06:53.466 --> 06:54.969
You have no idea the pressure to point

06:54.970 --> 06:56.094
the finger at someone for this.

06:56.095 --> 06:57.706
No matter how bogus that I.D.

07:02.218 --> 07:03.218
Look again.

07:04.604 --> 07:06.783
I-I can tell you these
were done in mexico, not here.

07:06.791 --> 07:07.906
Hiatt: How can you be so sure?

07:07.907 --> 07:10.715
The font. T-they use an older version.

07:10.716 --> 07:12.656
It's almost the same, but not quite.

07:12.657 --> 07:14.768
Mexicans and the sals, troubled times.

07:14.784 --> 07:16.658
Latinos can't even trust
each other these days.

07:16.659 --> 07:17.659
Wait outside.

07:19.970 --> 07:22.136
Brown and Brown, it's a place to start.

07:22.407 --> 07:24.795
Body count like this,
the aztecs and mayans

07:24.926 --> 07:27.908
are squabbling over more
than who invented the burrito.

07:27.909 --> 07:29.909
So let's start with the salvadorans.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.589
Thank you, sheriff.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.156
Didn't expect to see
your grenade tossing ass

07:35.157 --> 07:36.823
for at least another 30 years.

07:37.058 --> 07:38.720
Tejado: Oh, it's your lucky day.

07:38.721 --> 07:40.609
Oh, Guardo's number 2 has arrived.

07:42.468 --> 07:45.245
Why are your old amigos
beefing with the mexicans?

07:45.785 --> 07:48.982
Day trip for me,
but you wasted your time.

07:49.222 --> 07:50.277
Get your feet down!

07:51.845 --> 07:53.289
I'm just enjoying the air.

07:55.597 --> 07:58.152
What's it gonna take
to make it worth my time?

07:58.533 --> 08:01.032
Look, I want to know if Guardo
or any other salvadorans

08:01.033 --> 08:02.977
were behind the San Marcos murders.

08:03.035 --> 08:04.146
You get one request.

08:04.223 --> 08:06.783
I deny it, that's it,
you're back in your hole.

08:06.784 --> 08:08.728
But if it's something reasonable...

08:09.719 --> 08:11.607
I want my dick sucked by a hottie.

08:11.672 --> 08:13.242
Right here on the table.

08:15.035 --> 08:17.161
Thought it was gonna
be something difficult.

08:17.162 --> 08:20.358
Alright. Info first, dick suckin' next.

08:21.641 --> 08:23.864
OK. They killed Guardo.

08:24.222 --> 08:25.222
The mexicans.

08:25.787 --> 08:26.385
When?

08:26.386 --> 08:28.687
He came back to LA a week ago.

08:28.723 --> 08:30.167
Bam bam.
Just disappeared.

08:30.537 --> 08:31.785
Explains why we can't find him.

08:31.786 --> 08:33.035
Guardo works for the cartel.

08:33.037 --> 08:34.037
Why the bad blood?

08:35.493 --> 08:36.395
Yo no se.

08:37.136 --> 08:39.143
Hey, that dick ain't gonna suck itself.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.426
That's the straight-up truth.

08:40.427 --> 08:42.033
Beaners the ones started this beef.

08:42.034 --> 08:44.077
Salvas gonna finish it.

08:44.474 --> 08:47.551
So, Guardo's MIA, presumably dead,
you're wearing orange.

08:47.552 --> 08:48.799
Who's gonna take up the fight?

08:48.800 --> 08:50.535
It's been worked out
in upper management.

08:50.536 --> 08:51.472
Octavio...

08:51.473 --> 08:52.412
Rodrigo...

08:52.413 --> 08:53.413
Hernan...

08:53.534 --> 08:55.685
I know the first two. Who's this hernan?

08:55.686 --> 08:57.662
New guy. Wants to be the shot caller.

08:57.663 --> 08:58.599
If he's such a player,

08:58.600 --> 09:00.223
how come he's a mystery man to me?

09:00.224 --> 09:01.557
Just here from Salvador.

09:05.098 --> 09:06.098
Yeah?

09:07.289 --> 09:08.289
Where?

09:11.314 --> 09:13.627
Hey! What about my hummer?

09:15.974 --> 09:16.974
Asher.

09:16.975 --> 09:18.225
Come here.

09:18.823 --> 09:21.035
You're considered a hottie
in certain circles, right?

09:21.036 --> 09:22.091
Damn straight. Why?

09:22.762 --> 09:23.666
This is Tejado.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.475
He's got a special request for you.

09:25.476 --> 09:27.174
Yeah?
What's that?

09:31.039 --> 09:32.205
Yeah, that was Moses.

09:32.225 --> 09:33.120
The one-niner ball?

09:33.121 --> 09:34.973
Yeah, he's got some intel on Shane.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.307
I know this is
the first priority, though.

09:38.726 --> 09:40.163
Wyms wants you on a short leash.

09:40.164 --> 09:42.997
So don't go walking into traffic,
make me look bad.

09:45.224 --> 09:47.224
Your friend Graciela's been
released from the hospital.

09:47.225 --> 09:48.502
You know she was raped.

09:48.661 --> 09:49.661
Who's Graciela?

09:49.913 --> 09:53.537
According to the girls at
the Rec Center, you 2 are pretty tight.

09:53.538 --> 09:55.315
How long you been on the street?

09:56.103 --> 09:58.825
By law we're required to
send runaways back home.

09:59.165 --> 10:02.887
But if you cooperate, tell us
everything you know about Graciela...

10:02.982 --> 10:05.910
And promise to go back home on your own,

10:07.535 --> 10:09.090
We'll take you at your word.

10:12.161 --> 10:13.605
I haven't seen her lately.

10:13.659 --> 10:15.347
Any strange men ever
followed her around?

10:15.348 --> 10:16.909
Acting suspicious toward her?

10:16.910 --> 10:19.594
There's this one guy at
Ray's who was creeping us out.

10:19.595 --> 10:21.095
The burger stand on Wilcox?

10:21.282 --> 10:22.282
J.B.

10:22.595 --> 10:24.612
We'd smile, he'd give us
free burgers and shit.

10:24.613 --> 10:26.366
Ever feel sick after J.B. feeds you?

10:26.785 --> 10:28.656
No. Why?

10:29.596 --> 10:31.157
According to the girls
you were quite friendly.

10:31.158 --> 10:32.380
Giving them free food.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.734
They're lying. I never did that.

10:33.735 --> 10:36.219
'cause if you stole from your employer,
that's a parole violation.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.053
You homesick for the joint, J.B.?

10:38.411 --> 10:40.471
Look, maybe I talked
to them once or twice.

10:40.472 --> 10:42.038
Gave 'em leftovers. So?

10:42.287 --> 10:43.407
Talking to them's one thing.

10:43.408 --> 10:44.963
Spiking their soda with GHB,

10:45.097 --> 10:47.160
sodomizing and
torturing them's another.

10:47.161 --> 10:48.383
I didn't do that shit.

10:48.635 --> 10:51.471
It's gotta be tough to
meet a nice girl your age.

10:51.472 --> 10:53.584
Ex-con,
pulling minimum wage.

10:53.909 --> 10:56.675
But a homeless,
hungry 15-year-old runaway,

10:57.162 --> 10:59.384
Easy to impress with a burger and fries.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.532
Hey, hey,
it's cool, it's cool.

11:10.158 --> 11:11.788
You better pray you
didn't hurt that foot

11:11.789 --> 11:13.313
sticking it up a white cop's ass.

11:13.314 --> 11:14.599
Easy, dude.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.536
I'm rocking a pimp stick
'cause I'm cold like that.

11:16.537 --> 11:18.161
You got something to say about Shane?

11:18.162 --> 11:19.162
Start talking.

11:19.410 --> 11:20.465
You remember Tilli?

11:21.164 --> 11:23.552
That chick I was with
the last time we met.

11:23.728 --> 11:25.282
What, that 12-year-old you're sticking?

11:25.283 --> 11:27.347
She's 18 and old enough for your boy

11:27.348 --> 11:29.287
to be tapping that ass behind my back.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.163
You expect us to believe
Shane is banging that chick?

11:31.164 --> 11:32.162
That's what I said.

11:32.163 --> 11:33.922
Only reason I brought
y'all down is because

11:33.923 --> 11:35.723
y'all gonna have reason
to think I beat him down.

11:35.724 --> 11:38.779
Riding up in your girl's steeze
works as motive for me.

11:38.914 --> 11:40.162
I ain't hit that shit in a minute.

11:40.163 --> 11:42.163
And I ain't about no sloppy seconds.

11:42.288 --> 11:44.510
Word, I did not take flight on your boy.

11:44.725 --> 11:46.113
Not that I would a minded.

11:46.165 --> 11:47.165
Then who did?

11:47.852 --> 11:48.852
Ask the l'il ho.

11:49.289 --> 11:50.589
Seem like she all about telling

11:50.590 --> 11:52.559
the white man what he wanna hear.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.586
Hey, I'm Detective Wagenbach.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.539
Carlos Morganza.
Children's beacon.

11:58.540 --> 11:59.787
The runaway shelter on Western.

11:59.788 --> 12:01.037
You sent out an alert to us?

12:01.038 --> 12:01.911
Thanks for coming in.

12:01.912 --> 12:03.914
You're actually the first
person to get back to me.

12:03.915 --> 12:05.976
Well, when I heard
what happened to those girls,

12:05.977 --> 12:08.726
I put together a list of the kids
I thought were most at risk.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.393
You know, drugs, prostitution.

12:10.475 --> 12:12.789
Is there any way we can confirm
which of these kids have been seen

12:12.790 --> 12:14.663
and which haven't
in the last 24 hours?

12:14.664 --> 12:15.719
I'll do what I can.

12:16.789 --> 12:17.955
Thanks for coming in.

12:18.164 --> 12:22.224
Oh, um, my daughter
sabrina went missing.

12:22.351 --> 12:24.104
It's been 3 years now.

12:24.351 --> 12:28.116
Her case got cold,
the police had other priorities.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.678
If you could take a look.

12:31.977 --> 12:33.754
When I get a chance, absolutely.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.519
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:38.228 --> 12:39.228
Just take it easy.

12:40.961 --> 12:41.882
A little slower.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.727
Hey.

12:45.728 --> 12:46.728
Sorry.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.177
Jesus. We're gonna find out
who did this.

12:52.852 --> 12:53.852
How ya doing?

12:54.980 --> 12:57.924
You just saw the only part
of him that's not bruised.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.917
The Captain sent me over
here to take a statement.

13:00.918 --> 13:02.728
I already told Vic
everything that happened.

13:02.729 --> 13:04.541
Yeah. Well, I also have
orders to park myself

13:04.542 --> 13:06.102
out here as your protective detail.

13:06.103 --> 13:08.852
I'll be fine. I was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

13:08.853 --> 13:10.853
I got orders.
I'll be right outside.

13:11.668 --> 13:12.668
Thanks.

13:14.916 --> 13:15.916
You got it? OK.

13:21.977 --> 13:24.865
Feds faxed over some suspects
that fit your profile.

13:25.354 --> 13:26.853
Anything turn up at J.B.'s place?

13:26.854 --> 13:28.728
No signs he placed prison runaways.

13:28.729 --> 13:29.976
It's a fourth floor walk-up.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.980
He'd have to take his victims
up 4 flights of stairs.

13:31.981 --> 13:32.981
Paper thin walls.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.855
Hard to believe he could do
that without somebody noticing.

13:35.856 --> 13:36.856
Good luck.

13:37.689 --> 13:38.972
Detective Wagenbach.

13:39.623 --> 13:42.169
Carlos. Detective Billings,
Carlos Morganza.

13:42.170 --> 13:43.979
He's a counselor
at the children's beacon.

13:43.980 --> 13:45.757
I got involved about 3 years ago

13:45.793 --> 13:47.191
when my own daughter went missing.

13:47.192 --> 13:48.166
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.728
Listen, my colleagues and I checked

13:49.729 --> 13:52.043
into that list of high-risk
kids like you asked.

13:52.044 --> 13:53.293
These are the names of the ones

13:53.294 --> 13:54.729
we've lost touch with most recently.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.118
This is great. Thank you.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.723
Sure. Listen, I can run
through them with you.

13:58.856 --> 14:00.544
You know what?
I'm in the weeds right now,

14:00.545 --> 14:03.933
but if you can sit at my desk,
I can get a uni to take notes.

14:04.042 --> 14:05.214
Oh. Sure.

14:05.611 --> 14:06.611
Thank you.

14:09.692 --> 14:10.759
Dutchman.

14:10.957 --> 14:13.019
Remind me again your
profile of our bad guy.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.708
Why, so you can shit all over it?

14:14.709 --> 14:15.709
No, I'm serious.

14:17.662 --> 14:19.650
Uh, he's a single father,

14:19.772 --> 14:22.085
whose daughter disappeared
or died prematurely.

14:22.083 --> 14:26.148
What kind a douche bag breaks his ass
for no reason trying to help the cops?

14:26.149 --> 14:27.315
He's got a missing...

14:28.524 --> 14:29.959
Right? A lot of these freaks

14:29.960 --> 14:32.515
like to insert themselves
into investigations.

14:37.901 --> 14:39.585
Uh, you know what, Carlos,

14:39.586 --> 14:41.919
I think I can make time
for you right now.

14:42.022 --> 14:44.494
Claudette Wyms.
This is Cruz Pezula.

14:45.086 --> 14:47.460
I wanted to introduce Cruz
to the new Captain.

14:47.461 --> 14:50.016
More like the fresh meat
in Farmington. Hello.

14:50.086 --> 14:51.086
It's a pleasure.

14:51.087 --> 14:53.587
What's the latest on
the San Marcos massacre?

14:54.451 --> 14:55.427
I'm sorry.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.397
Are you with the police
committee as well?

14:57.398 --> 14:58.398
No, I'm not.

14:58.399 --> 15:00.939
I can vouch for Cruz.
He's well respected in the community.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.708
In fact, he's the one who
passed on that information

15:02.709 --> 15:04.986
about the possible
salvadoran connection.

15:05.148 --> 15:07.398
I know a lot of people
who are devastated

15:07.399 --> 15:09.450
by this new level of violence.

15:09.523 --> 15:10.523
As are we all.

15:10.585 --> 15:12.211
Claudette has
the committee's full support.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.462
How many Detectives you got on it?

15:13.463 --> 15:14.772
It's the entire Strike Team.

15:14.773 --> 15:15.510
Mackey, too?

15:15.511 --> 15:17.211
Kevin Hiatt's taking point.

15:17.212 --> 15:18.900
He was with INS 4 years.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.587
The victims are all mexican nationals...

15:20.588 --> 15:21.976
He's more than qualified.

15:22.024 --> 15:23.024
I should hope so.

15:24.837 --> 15:26.147
Could you give us a minute?

15:26.148 --> 15:27.148
Of course.

15:33.461 --> 15:35.516
Don't ever ambush me like that again.

15:35.588 --> 15:37.254
He has concerns. I share them.

15:37.465 --> 15:40.588
I don't care how plugged in to
your constituency that guy is.

15:40.589 --> 15:43.533
Bringing a civilian into
a confidential police matter

15:43.588 --> 15:46.641
undermines the investigation
and my authority.

15:48.091 --> 15:49.313
I meant no disrespect.

15:49.962 --> 15:51.214
But perhaps you wouldn't be taking it

15:51.215 --> 15:53.715
so personally if you had
more facts to share.

15:54.277 --> 15:55.087
I'm sorry, Captain.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.590
I didn't know you were in here.

15:56.591 --> 15:59.924
Would it be OK if we used this room
to talk to Mr. Morganza?

16:00.467 --> 16:03.522
No. I'm in the middle of something
with the councilman.

16:04.092 --> 16:05.425
I'm sorry to bother you.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.977
Would it be all right if
we talked in interrogation?

16:07.978 --> 16:09.653
It's a little less personal. Sorry.

16:09.654 --> 16:11.154
- Sure. Yeah. No problem.
- OK.

16:13.814 --> 16:15.676
Hey, Tilli!

16:16.345 --> 16:17.393
Get over here!

16:18.414 --> 16:21.089
Yo, why you calling me out
in front of my peoples?

16:21.090 --> 16:22.090
I'm a cop.

16:22.966 --> 16:24.132
I hear you like cops.

16:24.757 --> 16:26.653
That some sort of code or something?

16:26.654 --> 16:28.154
I know about you and Shane.

16:28.468 --> 16:29.634
He's in the hospital.

16:30.029 --> 16:31.816
- What for?
- Somebody jumped him.

16:31.817 --> 16:33.289
I figured you could tell us who.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.845
Wait. He caught a smackdown?

16:34.965 --> 16:36.909
Is he a'ight?
I want to go see him.

16:36.975 --> 16:37.774
Which hospital?

16:37.775 --> 16:39.211
His wife's with him right now.

16:39.212 --> 16:40.434
I'll say I'm a friend.

16:40.435 --> 16:43.553
Shane doesn't have
too many teenage black friends.

16:44.210 --> 16:45.265
How'd you get this?

16:46.213 --> 16:47.213
My stepdad.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.330
Your stepdad know you're
spreading your legs for Shane?

16:52.148 --> 16:53.259
He got pretty angry.

16:53.464 --> 16:55.352
I told him it wasn't his business.

16:55.401 --> 16:56.462
And if he tried to stop it,

16:56.463 --> 16:59.179
or put his hands on me again,
Shane would kick his ass.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.129
Where's he at now?

17:00.130 --> 17:01.087
Hell if I know.

17:01.088 --> 17:01.990
Where's he work?

17:01.991 --> 17:02.991
He don't.

17:03.302 --> 17:05.746
He about that monthly
check from the county.

17:06.346 --> 17:07.990
Look, if he did that to Shane,

17:07.991 --> 17:10.426
what do you think he's gonna do
to me the next time I see him?

17:10.428 --> 17:12.863
You stay away from the hospital
and stay away from your old man.

17:12.864 --> 17:14.086
I'll take care of him.

17:16.441 --> 17:19.699
Corrine, that percocet's not working.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.867
I'll ask the resident
for something stronger.

17:21.868 --> 17:22.518
Thanks.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.198
Listen, before I forget,

17:24.199 --> 17:25.492
these are his personal items,

17:25.492 --> 17:26.881
including his car keys...

17:26.882 --> 17:28.837
One of the unis removed
the bullets from his gun.

17:28.838 --> 17:30.742
Those things scare the hell out of me.

17:30.743 --> 17:31.743
Thanks.

17:34.006 --> 17:36.010
Can you give us a minute, please?

17:36.157 --> 17:37.657
Sure.
Thanks.

17:38.677 --> 17:40.232
God damn you!
How could you?

17:40.303 --> 17:42.678
Shit! Jesus! What?

17:42.679 --> 17:43.956
Why do you need condoms

17:43.957 --> 17:45.803
when I'm 3 months pregnant?

17:47.004 --> 17:49.050
They must have been from before.

17:50.148 --> 17:51.885
Mara, I'm not doing anything, baby.

17:51.886 --> 17:52.861
I swear.

17:52.862 --> 17:55.246
Son of a bitch.
Yes, you are!

17:57.475 --> 17:58.539
Does it have anything to do

17:58.540 --> 17:59.914
with the reason why you're here?

17:59.915 --> 18:00.915
Does it?

18:03.151 --> 18:04.252
Oh, no.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.058
Mara, it's nothing.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.314
It's nothing.

18:08.315 --> 18:09.370
It's not important.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.126
Look, I'm...

18:13.252 --> 18:16.070
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:16.565 --> 18:17.660
I've just... I've been all twisted up.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.323
I'm, I'm. You?

18:19.752 --> 18:22.142
This is us, OK? Our family.

18:22.339 --> 18:23.339
You threw it away.

18:24.635 --> 18:25.635
And for what?

18:26.189 --> 18:28.654
I've been trying to help
you through all of this,

18:28.655 --> 18:32.316
you waking up screaming,
and then you're out...

18:32.605 --> 18:34.487
Oh, I can't believe you!

18:35.830 --> 18:36.967
Jesus!

18:41.704 --> 18:43.049
This is for the pain.

18:53.571 --> 18:54.946
When sabrina first went missing,

18:54.947 --> 18:56.567
everyone pitched in to help find her.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.501
Friends, neighbors, my church.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.989
<i>But after a while, people go
back to their routines.</i>

19:02.257 --> 19:03.257
Life goes on.

19:04.007 --> 19:06.530
Even the police move on
to other business.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.389
But she's still out there.

19:09.821 --> 19:11.265
We appreciate you helping.

19:11.697 --> 19:14.821
All I can say is, as a parent myself,
it's gotta be awful.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.131
Your heart breaks all over again

19:16.132 --> 19:18.020
every day you don't hear from her.

19:18.945 --> 19:21.233
<i>There are 15 kids on your list.</i>

19:21.234 --> 19:22.570
<i>Is there any one you feel</i>

19:22.571 --> 19:24.682
is a particular risk to this predator?

19:27.634 --> 19:29.109
Oh, probably...

19:31.901 --> 19:32.901
Rosanna.

19:33.901 --> 19:35.647
She had a pimp. Had his claws in her.

19:35.648 --> 19:36.586
Once that happens,

19:36.587 --> 19:38.531
it sets up a whole victim mentality

19:38.532 --> 19:40.316
and that's an open invitation.

19:40.339 --> 19:42.335
When was the last time anyone saw her?

19:42.336 --> 19:43.397
2, 3 weeks ago.

19:44.899 --> 19:45.713
Dutch?

19:45.714 --> 19:46.587
Kevin Hiatt.

19:46.588 --> 19:47.337
New here.

19:47.338 --> 19:48.560
Yeah, I know. Welcome.

19:48.712 --> 19:49.823
Thanks. Hey, listen.

19:49.837 --> 19:52.213
We're running with
the San Marcos house murders.

19:52.214 --> 19:54.338
I was just wondering if you
had any files I should see?

19:54.339 --> 19:56.710
Uh, yeah. Give me a few minutes,
I'll get them together.

19:56.711 --> 19:57.774
Sure. Cool. Hey, listen.

19:57.775 --> 20:00.108
What do you know about
a guy named Hernan?

20:01.400 --> 20:02.860
Um... Come here.

20:05.589 --> 20:06.589
He's a Fed'.

20:07.027 --> 20:09.638
He's undercover in the
salvadoran organization.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.905
So, how do I get in touch with him?

20:14.086 --> 20:15.086
You don't.

20:15.651 --> 20:16.651
I tried.

20:17.775 --> 20:20.151
Female fed showed up
on my door at midnight

20:20.152 --> 20:21.461
saying she's Hernan's handler

20:21.462 --> 20:22.850
and to back the hell off.

20:23.150 --> 20:24.150
What agency?

20:24.529 --> 20:25.529
I.C.E.

20:25.776 --> 20:27.164
So don't waste your time.

20:28.588 --> 20:30.532
Well, it's my time to waste, right?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.407
What's his handler's name?

20:34.590 --> 20:35.590
Vic Mackey!

20:36.713 --> 20:37.713
Jesus Christ.

20:38.839 --> 20:40.394
The ghost of christmas past!

20:41.404 --> 20:42.402
You're looking good, man.

20:42.403 --> 20:43.400
For an old guy.

20:43.401 --> 20:46.012
I see them baldness cures
still ain't for shit.

20:46.091 --> 20:47.091
Oh, watch it.

20:47.965 --> 20:50.088
Hey, I heard about your guy.

20:50.089 --> 20:51.311
Curtis was a good kid.

20:51.488 --> 20:53.900
Well, none of us get outta this
place in one piece, right?

20:53.901 --> 20:55.734
Yeah. I was away for the funeral.

20:55.778 --> 20:57.403
Is there some sort of a charity

20:57.404 --> 20:59.459
or police memorial fund or something?

20:59.527 --> 21:00.949
Audubon society.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.400
Lem was really into birds, turns out.

21:03.401 --> 21:04.341
OK.

21:04.342 --> 21:06.094
Things really turned
around for you, looks like.

21:06.095 --> 21:08.527
Yeah. You know, I got
my feet underneath me.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.695
Doing pretty good. It took a minute,
but I'm doing pretty good.

21:10.696 --> 21:13.229
Look, I got a business
proposition for you.

21:13.591 --> 21:14.813
Look, rain check, man.

21:15.086 --> 21:17.652
I got 12 D.B.'s, no suspect.

21:17.653 --> 21:18.715
My partner took a beating.

21:18.716 --> 21:20.155
Not only am I flying solo,

21:20.156 --> 21:22.767
I gotta locate who did it
and return the favor.

21:22.841 --> 21:25.327
Come on, Vic. You helped me
through a rough patch, man.

21:25.328 --> 21:28.041
I'm just trying to, you know,
pay back the kindness.

21:28.966 --> 21:31.077
Come on, come on.
Take a ride with me.

21:31.078 --> 21:32.308
I'll have you back in 30.

21:32.687 --> 21:33.652
You're living large,

21:33.653 --> 21:36.541
driving around in a high-end
pussy magnet like this.

21:37.716 --> 21:41.049
Only now I got a 26-year-old filipina
I gotta keep in Gucci.

21:43.404 --> 21:45.626
The buzz is you're getting squeezed out.

21:46.156 --> 21:47.216
Maybe without a pension.

21:47.217 --> 21:48.828
I'm not getting squeezed out.

21:49.155 --> 21:51.652
And nobody's got their hand
in my pocket either.

21:51.653 --> 21:52.653
What's the job?

21:52.717 --> 21:54.966
Citizen, east LA., he owns
an apartment building.

21:54.967 --> 21:57.300
Wants to spruce it up
and raise the rents.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.835
Only there's this undesirable
element camped out there.

22:01.032 --> 22:03.586
So the landlord wants
to hire a cleaning crew.

22:04.469 --> 22:08.469
Jamaican dope operation's got the run
of the place, terrorizing Lieutenants.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.473
Can't evict 'em, long
as the rent's on time.

22:12.531 --> 22:15.279
Need a little hand persuading
them to move elsewhere, man.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.113
My plate's pretty full right now.

22:18.217 --> 22:20.219
Vic, there's families
living in this place.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.655
There's little kids riding their bikes

22:21.656 --> 22:22.779
next to these dope deals going down.

22:22.780 --> 22:25.280
The landlord's paying
good money, too, right?

22:27.781 --> 22:29.802
Cash. All right? Half up front.

22:31.657 --> 22:33.272
Look, man, just scope it out.

22:33.282 --> 22:34.266
If it looks good to you,

22:34.267 --> 22:37.533
having a real badge around'll
make this thing go a lot smoother.

22:37.534 --> 22:40.159
Besides, I can't do it without you.

22:43.615 --> 22:44.615
Let's look.

22:45.927 --> 22:47.204
Yeah. Come on! Come on!

22:48.364 --> 22:49.364
Spotter.

22:50.179 --> 22:51.512
Embedded with innocents.

22:52.992 --> 22:55.603
Glad I was wrong about
your getting shoved out.

22:56.242 --> 22:57.363
It's a shitty way to go.

22:57.364 --> 22:59.308
Everybody knows you got a raw deal.

23:00.806 --> 23:02.472
It was goddamned embarrassing.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.427
I mean, you shit blood for 'em,

23:04.428 --> 23:06.983
then you don't get to
leave on your own terms.

23:08.243 --> 23:10.409
Hope you never have
to go through that.

23:10.869 --> 23:11.869
Yeah.

23:13.741 --> 23:14.741
There's security.

23:14.742 --> 23:17.181
Yeah, and probably 2 more upstairs.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.295
Cashier guy, one at the door.

23:21.057 --> 23:22.741
I'm gonna take a pass on this, Joe,

23:22.742 --> 23:25.742
and whether you realize it or
not, you should do the same.

23:25.743 --> 23:26.909
You don't understand.

23:27.243 --> 23:29.520
Vic, this is my only
paycheck this month.

23:32.368 --> 23:34.034
I really gotta get going back.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.055
Can you at least run
priors on this place,

23:40.056 --> 23:42.944
let me see what level asswipe
I'm dealing with here?

23:44.431 --> 23:45.431
Yeah, sure.

23:47.993 --> 23:48.993
<i>It's Rosanna.</i>

23:49.558 --> 23:51.613
She had a pimp. Had his claws in her.

23:51.681 --> 23:54.447
Once that happens, it sets
up a whole victim mentality,

23:54.448 --> 23:56.183
and that's
an open invitation.

23:56.683 --> 23:57.683
Is that him, baby?

23:58.432 --> 23:59.876
I'm sure that's his voice.

24:00.434 --> 24:01.434
You're positive?

24:01.743 --> 24:02.930
I was pretty out of it,

24:02.931 --> 24:06.558
but if there's a voice
I'll never forget, it's his.

24:11.557 --> 24:12.834
Entrance off the alley.

24:14.183 --> 24:15.183
Yeah, he pulls up,

24:15.369 --> 24:17.307
takes the victims inside
without anyone seeing.

24:17.308 --> 24:18.308
Yep.

24:31.306 --> 24:34.433
Hope your profile didn't say
anything about him being a neat freak.

24:34.434 --> 24:36.181
You wouldn't want a
cleaning lady coming around

24:36.182 --> 24:38.182
if you were holding
a girl prisoner.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
Dutch.

24:46.059 --> 24:47.059
Rosanna?

24:52.621 --> 24:53.621
Sabrina's room.

24:55.371 --> 24:57.204
Concert poster Princess rembered.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.121
What 15-year-old keeps
her room this neat?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.935
The mess in the rest of
the house, he's letting go,

25:00.936 --> 25:04.498
falling apart, in here,
he's preserving her memory,

25:04.499 --> 25:06.554
or an idealized version of it anyway.

25:08.060 --> 25:09.671
God, and what a clean-up job.

25:09.996 --> 25:12.400
Shampoo, wax.

25:13.122 --> 25:15.122
I wouldn't count on any hair fibers.

25:16.498 --> 25:17.498
Yeah.

25:26.059 --> 25:27.114
We talked to Tilli.

25:33.121 --> 25:34.843
Her old man got the drop on me.

25:37.309 --> 25:39.122
It's nothing.
It's just a thing...

25:39.123 --> 25:41.185
- Jesus Christ, Shane.
- Like no one in this car's

25:41.186 --> 25:43.228
ever had a little outta
bounds ass before.

25:43.229 --> 25:45.310
This is an 18-year-old girl,

25:45.311 --> 25:47.309
who's bedded down with
the head of the one-niners.

25:47.310 --> 25:49.787
She's done with him.
Ask her.

25:49.998 --> 25:52.664
You saying this is about
more than getting laid?

25:53.249 --> 25:54.582
Look, everything's cool.

25:54.583 --> 25:56.224
She just shot off
her mouth about us

25:56.225 --> 25:59.359
to the dickhead stepdad
and I got blindsided.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.526
Yeah, I can see that.

26:00.861 --> 26:03.049
Might wanna raise the
mistress bar a little bit.

26:03.050 --> 26:05.772
If you still want a wife
and kid to come home to.

26:09.487 --> 26:11.653
You ever think
about just coming clean?

26:13.738 --> 26:14.738
About everything?

26:17.487 --> 26:18.487
No.

26:21.864 --> 26:22.864
Yeah, I know.

26:25.174 --> 26:27.229
I guess we just have to live with it.

26:36.236 --> 26:38.847
All right.
It's dealer's choice on the stepdad.

26:38.924 --> 26:40.860
Either Ronnie and I can
take care of him tonight,

26:40.861 --> 26:42.799
or wait until you're
strong enough to join in.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
No.

26:44.049 --> 26:45.104
No, just let it go.

26:45.239 --> 26:47.049
This guy knowingly laid hands on a cop.

26:47.050 --> 26:48.989
This isn't just about your bruised ego.

26:48.990 --> 26:50.101
There's a principle.

26:50.612 --> 26:53.167
Look, I don't want you
to do anything, please?

26:54.365 --> 26:55.809
I got enough to deal with.

27:10.308 --> 27:11.308
Mara?

27:13.372 --> 27:14.372
Mara?

27:17.712 --> 27:18.724
Mara.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.809
Mara?

27:27.438 --> 27:28.607
Mara, come on.

27:30.059 --> 27:31.225
Look, this is stupid.

27:33.938 --> 27:36.107
Mara, please,
just open the door.

27:40.688 --> 27:42.799
Some black bitch called on your phone.

27:43.437 --> 27:45.060
She wanted to know if you were OK.

27:45.061 --> 27:46.616
She sounded like she was 10.

27:48.813 --> 27:51.924
Is that who you're banging
while I got morning sickness?

27:54.560 --> 27:55.744
- Mara.
- Just...

27:57.373 --> 27:58.683
You've always been an asshole.

27:58.684 --> 28:00.120
Mara, please, I just...

28:00.121 --> 28:02.454
Yeah, I know, you're
all torn up over Lem.

28:05.497 --> 28:06.497
Get out.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.922
I don't want our son or the new one
growing up anywhere near you.

28:11.435 --> 28:12.723
Get out!

28:24.521 --> 28:25.533
OK.

28:27.436 --> 28:28.436
What's up?

28:28.437 --> 28:29.750
My guy at INS I.D.'d the arm

28:29.751 --> 28:30.936
from the San Marcos house.

28:30.937 --> 28:32.165
Eduardo Romero.

28:33.001 --> 28:34.251
That supposed to mean something?

28:34.252 --> 28:37.009
Romero's a mid-level bureaucrat
in the mexican government.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.513
Presidential appointment.

28:40.191 --> 28:43.357
Traveling around with a bunch
of drug-connected convicts?

28:43.500 --> 28:44.689
One of their own officials.

28:44.690 --> 28:45.874
This guy should have
been the first one

28:45.875 --> 28:47.313
the mexican government would've I.D.'d.

28:47.314 --> 28:48.814
So why didn't they tell us?

28:50.877 --> 28:52.501
Could embarrass a lot of powerful people

28:52.502 --> 28:53.873
on both sides of the border.

28:53.874 --> 28:54.874
That's right.

28:56.065 --> 28:57.065
Huh.

28:57.516 --> 28:58.763
Stop! No notes.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.689
This doesn't exist for
anybody but us right now.

29:01.690 --> 29:03.125
The captain asked for an update.

29:03.126 --> 29:04.348
You heard what I said.

29:04.634 --> 29:06.297
- What am I supposed to do...
- Hey, no report.

29:06.877 --> 29:07.751
This is raw intel.

29:07.752 --> 29:09.437
We don't even know where it leads yet.

29:09.438 --> 29:11.750
The difference between
the units and the Strike Team

29:11.751 --> 29:14.584
is you don't hand your
superior pieces of a puzzle,

29:14.768 --> 29:16.545
you hand them the whole picture.

29:26.063 --> 29:27.961
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

29:27.962 --> 29:30.280
We talked to local pimps,

29:30.643 --> 29:31.764
put unis out on the street

29:31.765 --> 29:33.954
trolling the places where
you said Rosanna works.

29:33.955 --> 29:37.392
In the meantime, are there any other
places you can think of we should look?

29:37.393 --> 29:38.393
Not really.

29:38.770 --> 29:39.770
Think hard.

29:40.019 --> 29:41.574
Sometimes we can locate kids

29:41.575 --> 29:43.456
just from personal
information about them.

29:43.457 --> 29:46.694
Kinda movies they like, where they eat,
music they listen to.

29:46.695 --> 29:48.069
Yeah. I mean, you
show me a kid's room,

29:48.070 --> 29:50.070
and I can tell you their life story.

29:52.785 --> 29:54.832
You searched my house, didn't you?

29:55.818 --> 29:56.984
Why would we do that?

29:57.569 --> 29:59.402
You looked in my daughter's room.

30:02.695 --> 30:04.361
You won't find anything there.

30:04.384 --> 30:05.130
We've got two witnesses

30:05.131 --> 30:06.567
that can I.D. you as the rapist.

30:06.568 --> 30:07.571
They recognize your voice

30:07.572 --> 30:10.405
and they rember the poster
in your daughter's room.

30:11.570 --> 30:14.681
My lawyer'll have me out of here
before your shift ends.

30:14.821 --> 30:16.432
I'll be home before you guys.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.556
You want to find your daughter, right?

30:25.196 --> 30:26.196
Right?

30:27.195 --> 30:28.694
You tell us what we want to know,

30:28.695 --> 30:30.583
I will personally re-open her case

30:30.948 --> 30:32.948
and do everything I can to find her.

30:36.070 --> 30:37.070
You want answers?

30:38.385 --> 30:40.107
All right. I'll give 'em to you

30:40.445 --> 30:42.500
but only in front of a news reporter.

30:43.071 --> 30:45.015
I want Sabrina's story aired on tv.

30:45.071 --> 30:47.293
I won't let you all bury her away again.

30:51.198 --> 30:53.134
Couple 211's, possession.

30:53.135 --> 30:54.697
One of 'em caught an "F" for ag assault.

30:54.698 --> 30:55.753
Mostly minor stuff.

30:55.947 --> 30:57.835
If you round up a few more guys...

30:59.758 --> 31:01.071
I'm sorry to leave you hanging.

31:01.072 --> 31:02.072
Oh, no worries.

31:02.199 --> 31:04.810
My buddy's waiting outside.
We can handle this.

31:06.572 --> 31:08.349
Lotta ghosts in this place, man.

31:09.011 --> 31:10.288
Every day is Halloween.

31:12.386 --> 31:13.386
I'll walk you out.

31:13.825 --> 31:14.825
Goddamn freeway.

31:15.385 --> 31:17.635
This city's turning into
a third world shitbag.

31:17.636 --> 31:19.136
This is Lester. Vic Mackey.

31:19.571 --> 31:20.848
Know you by reputation.

31:22.387 --> 31:24.386
I haven't been south of
pico or east of the 110

31:24.387 --> 31:25.698
since I turned the badge in.

31:25.699 --> 31:27.946
Yeah. Well, this'll be good
exercise for you then, huh?

31:27.947 --> 31:31.385
Maybe you should take a couple
more bodies with you on this one, Joe.

31:31.386 --> 31:34.009
Afro-humps'll be so stoned
they won't even know what hit them.

31:34.010 --> 31:36.697
These guys seem like
they're on their game.

31:36.698 --> 31:38.450
One of them caught
a weapons charge recently.

31:38.451 --> 31:41.707
Trust me. Raids like this,
I used to do in my sleep.

31:42.386 --> 31:43.386
Literally.

31:48.638 --> 31:49.638
Hey, Joe.

31:49.887 --> 31:50.887
Yeah?

31:51.635 --> 31:53.023
You still need a wingman?

31:55.139 --> 31:57.027
I'll have you back here in a hour.

31:57.311 --> 31:58.793
So, what's your shot
in all this?

31:58.794 --> 32:00.022
Punishing these girls for running away,

32:00.023 --> 32:02.783
get back at your own kid
for disappearing?

32:03.826 --> 32:07.675
If it gets one girl to go home,
back to her parents...

32:09.574 --> 32:11.351
That's a gift I was never given.

32:11.825 --> 32:14.047
These girls were only anally penetrated.

32:14.637 --> 32:16.011
This wasn't about pleasure.

32:16.012 --> 32:17.012
It was punishment.

32:17.949 --> 32:19.448
Thing I'm having trouble understanding

32:19.449 --> 32:21.615
is how putting these girls through hell

32:21.703 --> 32:23.012
was going to get your daughter back?

32:23.013 --> 32:25.330
Well, you people gave up
looking for her, didn't you?

32:25.331 --> 32:29.564
3 measly goddamn months
of investigating you just gave up.

32:32.727 --> 32:34.282
Look, I'm responsible, too.

32:35.539 --> 32:36.866
I could've made it easier for her.

32:36.867 --> 32:37.805
But without her mother...

32:37.806 --> 32:39.373
Wait. Why did she leave?

32:40.789 --> 32:42.622
Look, I've told you my story.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.438
Find her. She's been
missing for 3 years.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.044
You know what, I may have to rework

32:50.414 --> 32:53.456
the rapist's profile, Steve,
because our suspect

32:53.726 --> 32:55.040
is beginning to look like a person

32:55.041 --> 32:57.152
of interest in a murder investigation.

32:57.288 --> 32:58.878
I didn't kill Sabrina!

32:59.537 --> 33:00.537
My own daughter?

33:01.726 --> 33:03.415
Look, she's alive.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.027
I just can't find her myself.

33:05.163 --> 33:06.666
You're still not telling
us the whole truth.

33:06.667 --> 33:10.076
The deal's off unless you come
a hundred percent clean.

33:10.728 --> 33:12.783
You didn't kill her?
Why'd she leave?

33:17.243 --> 33:19.240
Give me the videotape and get out.

33:19.773 --> 33:20.916
Give me the video.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.358
No, no. OK, OK.

33:23.666 --> 33:24.666
No, I'll tell you.

33:25.793 --> 33:29.027
Just make her turn
the camera off first.

33:30.227 --> 33:31.227
Turn it off.

33:38.101 --> 33:40.156
Sabrina's mother died when she was 9.

33:41.851 --> 33:42.851
Hodgkin's disease.

33:44.542 --> 33:45.588
Sabrina never got over it.

33:45.589 --> 33:46.852
I mean...

33:47.917 --> 33:48.917
Neither of us did.

33:51.853 --> 33:52.964
She began to look...

33:54.106 --> 33:55.494
More and more like Carly.

33:57.855 --> 33:58.855
When I'd...

34:00.853 --> 34:03.908
When I'd hold her in my arms
in bed at night, it was...

34:04.980 --> 34:07.091
Almost like my wife was still with me.

34:08.543 --> 34:12.098
I don't think Sabrina understood just
how much like her she was.

34:15.043 --> 34:16.043
In every way.

34:17.976 --> 34:19.476
You molested your daughter?

34:28.670 --> 34:30.447
Turn the camera back on, please.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.114
Sabrina, honey, if you hear this...

34:43.103 --> 34:44.547
I never meant to hurt you.

34:44.549 --> 34:45.728
Oh, Jesus.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.202
I never meant to be so selfish.

34:57.172 --> 34:58.172
Come back home.

34:58.545 --> 34:59.545
Please.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.229
Lester: How long does it take to cop?

35:03.230 --> 35:05.225
Spook gives the money,
spook gets the dope.

35:05.231 --> 35:06.842
Been in there for 20 minutes.

35:08.733 --> 35:12.177
With brothers, goddamn handshakes
can burn up 10 minutes easy.

35:14.668 --> 35:15.668
Garlic?

35:16.609 --> 35:17.609
Makes you stink.

35:18.296 --> 35:21.073
Gives you an intimidating
psychological advantage.

35:22.730 --> 35:23.980
No, I'll pass.

35:23.981 --> 35:25.592
I'd like to get laid tonight.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.646
I heard that.

35:29.500 --> 35:30.674
Let's do this.

35:30.857 --> 35:31.857
Let's go!

35:44.895 --> 35:45.985
Clear!

35:46.124 --> 35:47.136
Hey!

35:47.425 --> 35:48.310
Hey, ho!

35:48.311 --> 35:49.668
Get away from that damned door!

35:49.669 --> 35:51.696
Get away from it! Down on your knees!
Come on!

35:51.697 --> 35:53.309
Move, man!
Hey, watch it!

35:59.123 --> 36:00.358
Son of a bitch!

36:10.859 --> 36:11.859
Fore!

36:14.985 --> 36:15.985
Clear now.

36:18.233 --> 36:20.546
With a sheepdog, huh?
That's how she made you?

36:20.547 --> 36:22.158
Just read me...
Come on, man.

36:22.611 --> 36:23.611
Come on, man.

36:24.562 --> 36:25.683
Easy, man.
Come on, man.

36:25.684 --> 36:26.731
The locks, man!

36:26.732 --> 36:28.071
You ain't no real cops!
Shut up!

36:28.072 --> 36:29.072
How much you want?

36:29.370 --> 36:30.885
We'll cut you
devils in for half.

36:30.886 --> 36:32.052
Gimme the super glue.

36:32.574 --> 36:33.574
Get his hands.

36:33.762 --> 36:34.762
Get his hands.

36:35.824 --> 36:36.824
Come on!

36:38.247 --> 36:39.247
You dumb...

36:41.371 --> 36:43.473
All righty.
Get up. Go on.

36:43.811 --> 36:45.248
This is some felonious bullshit, man!

36:45.249 --> 36:46.427
Shut up.

36:46.622 --> 36:49.481
Assholes who don't
listen don't get to speak.

36:50.259 --> 36:50.873
Hey, hey, hey!

36:51.184 --> 36:52.184
That's enough.

37:03.808 --> 37:05.134
Man: What do you want, man?

37:05.135 --> 37:06.903
Money? Ganja?

37:07.249 --> 37:07.969
Come on, bitch!
Come on, bitch!

37:07.970 --> 37:09.487
Take it, take it.
Take it! Jesus!

37:09.704 --> 37:10.734
Come on. Get in there!

37:11.439 --> 37:12.613
Come on!

37:15.248 --> 37:16.956
Piss or bleed. Your choice.

37:20.679 --> 37:21.619
Oh, boy.

37:22.562 --> 37:23.733
That's it, baby.

37:26.059 --> 37:27.059
Yeah.

37:27.187 --> 37:28.184
Yeah.

37:28.185 --> 37:29.185
That's good!

37:29.248 --> 37:30.248
Now...

37:30.810 --> 37:34.365
Like a good fella, take a drink
out of the toilet and lap it up.

37:34.624 --> 37:36.713
- Lap it up.
- No, man. I ain't getting...

37:36.714 --> 37:38.829
Man, come on, drink! Drink!

37:39.125 --> 37:40.125
Lap it up, boy!

37:40.626 --> 37:42.182
Lap it! Yeah!

37:45.381 --> 37:47.043
That's it!
Jesus Christ!

37:50.811 --> 37:52.624
This is your official eviction notice.

37:52.625 --> 37:54.686
As of right now, you are
no longer tenants of this building.

37:54.687 --> 37:55.170
You hear me?

37:55.171 --> 37:56.855
Yeah, man.
Yeah, man.

38:19.754 --> 38:21.615
Landlord's got another apartment
building in south central.

38:21.616 --> 38:22.750
I'm done.

38:22.753 --> 38:23.876
I'll get rid of Lester.

38:23.877 --> 38:25.210
I'll help you with that.

38:25.922 --> 38:27.617
Guess all that bad ass noise

38:27.626 --> 38:29.237
I heard about you's bullshit.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.938
Guess so. Look, you guys
are going the other way.

38:31.939 --> 38:33.563
I'll call a black and white for a ride.

38:33.564 --> 38:34.562
Come on, Vic. Get in, get in.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.507
Let him go, man.
We don't need him.

38:37.063 --> 38:37.918
Word is most of the guys

38:37.919 --> 38:39.439
on his team end up dead anyhow.

38:42.505 --> 38:43.505
Vic.

38:45.940 --> 38:46.940
Vic!

38:55.752 --> 38:58.648
Detective! Did Sabrina make the news?

38:59.034 --> 39:00.118
Yeah, it was the lead story.

39:00.119 --> 39:02.486
Oh, good.
Oh, that's good.

39:03.010 --> 39:04.288
After the segment ran,

39:04.939 --> 39:07.050
another division got an anonymous tip.

39:08.005 --> 39:09.002
Said they'd find her body

39:09.003 --> 39:10.891
out in a grave near lake Elsinore.

39:11.505 --> 39:13.282
Police there just dug up a body.

39:16.952 --> 39:20.277
No. No, that's
somebody else's little girl.

39:20.278 --> 39:23.651
It's not... That's just some
kind of a prank, is what that is!

39:23.652 --> 39:27.374
Some asshole saw the story
and just wanted to hurt me!

39:27.980 --> 39:29.941
No. My Sabrina just needs to hear me.

39:29.942 --> 39:31.108
Ask her to come home.

39:32.690 --> 39:33.856
Your daughter's dead!

39:34.506 --> 39:35.442
You made her run away!

39:35.443 --> 39:36.443
She got killed!

40:08.884 --> 40:10.661
That's Hernan in the blue shirt.

40:11.007 --> 40:13.131
I sweet-talked the I.C.E.
queen into letting us

40:13.132 --> 40:14.943
have some face time with the boy,

40:14.944 --> 40:17.055
so long as I promised we'll be subtle.

40:17.255 --> 40:19.866
Gonna have to treat him
like any other bad guy.

40:20.379 --> 40:21.318
Ready?

40:21.319 --> 40:22.319
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

40:38.758 --> 40:40.573
Hey, stop, stop fighting!

40:40.808 --> 40:41.567
We know who you are.

40:41.568 --> 40:42.487
You're Hernan.

40:42.488 --> 40:44.443
Agent Zinman told me where to find you.

40:44.444 --> 40:45.444
Who are you?

40:45.508 --> 40:46.696
We're on the same side.

40:46.697 --> 40:47.697
Get up. Come on.

40:50.779 --> 40:52.080
Make it look great for the boys.

40:55.570 --> 40:56.634
We heard about some trouble

40:56.635 --> 40:58.256
with the salvadorans and the mexicans.

40:58.257 --> 41:00.757
Tell me you assholes didn't risk
blowing my cover for that.

41:00.758 --> 41:03.193
What we got is the salvadorans
might have called for a hit

41:03.194 --> 41:04.527
on the San Marcos house,

41:04.946 --> 41:07.834
then the mexicans retaliated
by killing Guardo Lima.

41:08.757 --> 41:09.923
It wasn't the salvis.

41:10.322 --> 41:12.266
Word is it was some other mexicans.

41:12.507 --> 41:13.507
Killed their own?

41:13.758 --> 41:14.570
Unlikely.

41:14.571 --> 41:16.634
Especially when one of the victims
was a government official.

41:16.635 --> 41:18.246
Eduardo Romero. You know him?

41:18.507 --> 41:20.562
No. It's probably some internal beef.

41:20.945 --> 41:24.298
Look, my guess...
Guardo's collateral damage.

41:24.479 --> 41:26.006
Well, it serves him right.

41:26.007 --> 41:27.510
Prick blew up a friend of mine.

41:27.511 --> 41:30.479
What, that cop?
Guardo didn't do that.

41:30.948 --> 41:33.820
I don't care what side
this guy's on, he's full of shit.

41:33.821 --> 41:35.947
We all knew Emolia
was snitching to I.A.D.

41:35.948 --> 41:38.446
We knew she was up in
the safe house on Harvest.

41:38.447 --> 41:41.258
We know she's up in Seattle
right now at her sister's.

41:41.259 --> 41:43.481
But the word came down, no distractions.

41:45.008 --> 41:47.072
These guys don't take out their own rat,

41:47.073 --> 41:48.135
no way they'd kill a cop.

41:48.136 --> 41:49.302
It was somebody else.

41:50.139 --> 41:52.250
Shit, Guardo wasn't even up here then.

41:52.448 --> 41:53.836
He was in Mexico with me.

41:57.884 --> 41:59.884
Is anyone gonna make this look good?

42:02.394 --> 42:03.394
Come on, come on!

42:04.146 --> 42:05.146
Get up for me!

42:05.584 --> 42:06.861
Guardo didn't kill Lem.

42:07.580 --> 42:08.635
Maybe he's wrong...

42:08.646 --> 42:09.646
He's not wrong!

42:11.643 --> 42:12.643
He's not wrong.

42:13.173 --> 42:14.203
Gimme your hand.

42:30.582 --> 42:31.582
Get out.

42:31.583 --> 42:32.709
Baby, please...

42:33.520 --> 42:34.268
Just go.

42:34.269 --> 42:36.018
Please, just ask me to come back.

42:36.019 --> 42:37.019
No.

42:37.020 --> 42:39.827
Baby, please, I'm begging you, please.

42:40.144 --> 42:42.863
Just ask me to come back
right now. Please.

42:50.647 --> 42:52.731
Our son is in the other room.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.134
OK. You've got to forgive me.

42:59.135 --> 43:01.956
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What I did was wrong.

43:01.957 --> 43:04.271
I know it. Please, Mara, please.

43:04.272 --> 43:07.235
God. Please, just take me back.

43:07.666 --> 43:10.829
You want me to forgive you
for sleeping with a girl

43:11.023 --> 43:13.991
that is barely out
of an inner-city middle school?

43:14.211 --> 43:16.793
Forget it. Go ahead. Shoot me.

43:17.270 --> 43:19.663
Shoot yourself. I'm not forgiving you.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.071
Jackson can never know what I've done.

43:23.396 --> 43:25.562
Our son can never know what we've done.

43:30.709 --> 43:32.820
Did Vic get you involved in something?

43:34.001 --> 43:35.314
He doesn't even know.

43:41.523 --> 43:42.523
I killed Lem.

43:45.023 --> 43:46.023
I did.

43:46.397 --> 43:47.397
I did it.

43:47.522 --> 43:48.522
I did it.

43:50.087 --> 43:53.198
I dropped the grenade in his lap
and I just walked away.

43:54.961 --> 43:55.961
And he was...

43:56.211 --> 43:59.942
He was still breathing, he was alive,

44:00.336 --> 44:01.336
and I just...

44:02.633 --> 44:04.613
I just left him there, you know.

44:04.614 --> 44:05.900
I just... No.

44:06.152 --> 44:08.470
Mara, I-I killed him.

44:11.460 --> 44:12.460
Why?

44:12.776 --> 44:13.776
For us.

44:14.211 --> 44:15.433
Mara, I did it for us.

44:16.648 --> 44:18.592
I thought he was gonna take a deal.

44:18.835 --> 44:20.779
That he was gonna give us all away.

44:22.799 --> 44:25.299
I thought he was gonna
take me away from you,

44:25.610 --> 44:28.043
from Jackson, from our baby.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.360
I didn't know what else to do, Mara.

44:34.855 --> 44:36.680
Now it's all wrong.

44:37.300 --> 44:38.300
It's all wrong.

44:38.610 --> 44:40.276
It just keeps going all wrong.

44:42.609 --> 44:46.537
God, please, God, please,
please forgive me, please!

44:46.555 --> 44:48.609
I can't... I can't do this any more.

44:48.802 --> 44:49.802
I'm sorry.

44:50.115 --> 44:51.561
Please, just ask me back.
