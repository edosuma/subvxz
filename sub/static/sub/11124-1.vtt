01:35.696 --> 01:37.485
- Name?
- Karen Silkwood.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.659
- Drew Stephens.
- Dolly Pelliker.

02:00.305 --> 02:02.607
Hi, Ham.

02:16.851 --> 02:18.280
- Good-bye.
- All right.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.025
All right, see you.

02:51.988 --> 02:55.152
So then the woman got up...

02:55.189 --> 02:57.971
and she was dressed
in a long white dress...

02:58.004 --> 02:59.411
just like an angel.

02:59.445 --> 03:02.380
And she called for the people
to come on up...

03:02.421 --> 03:06.764
and this kid came up
with an arm...

03:06.805 --> 03:09.675
that was almost pitch black
from blood poisoning.

03:09.718 --> 03:12.238
But that woman held that arm...

03:12.278 --> 03:14.165
and she prayed over it...

03:14.198 --> 03:17.329
and it turned pink
right in front of your eyes.

03:17.366 --> 03:20.268
And then it fell right off.

03:20.310 --> 03:22.350
I was there, Wesley.

03:22.390 --> 03:24.333
I was sitting right there.

03:24.374 --> 03:27.669
When I was in the service,
I saw this gook...

03:27.703 --> 03:29.710
drink a glass of milk
through his pecker.

03:31.350 --> 03:35.823
What? Then what happened?

03:35.863 --> 03:37.903
Didn't follow him home
to find out.

03:37.943 --> 03:40.016
This is dry processing...

03:40.055 --> 03:41.778
the heart of
the production process.

03:41.815 --> 03:43.091
Come on in, trainees.

03:45.047 --> 03:47.535
This brown powder
you see here...

03:47.575 --> 03:50.423
is mixed plutonium
and uranium oxide.

03:50.455 --> 03:52.278
And these trained technicians...

03:52.312 --> 03:55.160
are fabricating it
into fuel pellets.

03:55.192 --> 03:56.305
Karen, could you explain...

03:56.344 --> 03:58.002
the procedures
in this glove box?

03:59.512 --> 04:02.098
Yeah. What we're doing is
we're blending and mixing...

04:02.136 --> 04:05.715
the plutonium and uranium oxide
into correct ratios.

04:05.753 --> 04:08.120
And then we sift it
for impurities.

04:08.153 --> 04:11.000
And then it's fed
into the slugging press...

04:11.033 --> 04:12.920
which makes the pellets.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.960
This is the slugging press...

04:15.001 --> 04:17.719
where the powder
is turned into pellets.

04:17.753 --> 04:21.583
What about radiation effects
from all this material?

04:21.625 --> 04:23.698
We've all seen a poor guy...

04:23.738 --> 04:25.396
suffering
the effects of sunburn.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.441
Radiation is like that.

04:27.482 --> 04:29.238
It's the kind of thing
that can't hurt you...

04:29.274 --> 04:31.183
unless you're careless with it.

04:35.962 --> 04:38.002
Hey, Wesley?

04:38.043 --> 04:41.458
Come here. I need the help
of a trained technician here.

04:43.514 --> 04:44.976
Come here.

04:47.707 --> 04:49.267
Put it back in!

04:52.347 --> 04:55.511
Hey, Georgie. You know
that ol' girl Jeane Dixon...

04:55.547 --> 04:57.205
the one with the stars
on her palms?

04:57.244 --> 04:59.349
She was on Johnny Carson
one night...

04:59.387 --> 05:01.493
and she's telling
how her niece phoned her up.

05:01.532 --> 05:04.980
Niece goes, "I got to catch
this airplane to Houston."

05:05.020 --> 05:06.482
And Jeane Dixon goes...

05:06.524 --> 05:08.182
"Now, don't you get on
that airplane."

05:08.220 --> 05:10.075
And by golly,
that airplane crashed.

05:10.108 --> 05:11.286
What do you make of that?

05:11.324 --> 05:13.234
She's got the gift, all right.

05:13.276 --> 05:15.218
Or maybe she just
tells everybody she knows...

05:15.260 --> 05:17.202
not to get on planes,
and then one day...

05:17.245 --> 05:19.187
one crashes
and that's her lucky day.

05:19.228 --> 05:20.886
Drew says he's got
to work an hour overtime...

05:20.925 --> 05:22.169
so he can't leave till 7:00.

05:22.205 --> 05:24.507
OK. Shit!
I forgot to get permission.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.541
I don't know.
I believe in that stuff.

05:27.581 --> 05:29.523
Sometimes it happens
where I know things.

05:29.565 --> 05:31.900
Can you tell if
I'm getting this weekend off?

05:31.933 --> 05:34.421
- Go see my kids?
- It don't work like that.

05:34.461 --> 05:38.488
I can't sit here
and find out just anything.

05:38.526 --> 05:41.909
I have to wait for it
to smack into me.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.372
- Lunch!
- I got to find Hurley.

05:44.414 --> 05:46.748
Karen,
you never monitor yourself.

05:46.782 --> 05:47.992
Come back here
and do it like the rest of us.

05:48.030 --> 05:49.557
"Karen,
you never monitor yourself."

05:49.598 --> 05:50.907
I'll get you, girl.

05:50.942 --> 05:53.812
Know what happens to girls
that don't monitor themselves?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.709
Your nipples turn green.

06:04.671 --> 06:06.362
There's nothing they can do.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.254
Where they going to park
a contaminated truck?

06:08.288 --> 06:10.175
It'll stay that way
twenty-five thousand years.

06:10.208 --> 06:12.793
They can put it in space.
Hell, put it in orbit.

06:12.832 --> 06:15.134
- Yeah, in orbit.
- Put it on the moon.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.272
- What's going on?
- They cooked a truck.

06:17.312 --> 06:18.621
There was a leak
in one of the barrels.

06:18.655 --> 06:19.801
Dolly tell you
I have to work late?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.393
Yeah.
The whole weekend's screwed up.

06:22.432 --> 06:25.848
I forgot to get permission.
Now I can't find Hurley.

06:25.888 --> 06:27.066
You better find him.

06:27.104 --> 06:29.439
Heard those guys on the truck
didn't monitor themselves.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.966
That's a surprise.

06:32.929 --> 06:36.060
- New guy in X-ray.
- See y'all later.

06:36.097 --> 06:38.202
- What's his name?
- OK. Take care.

06:38.241 --> 06:42.103
Winston something.
Do you like him?

06:42.145 --> 06:45.112
As a matter of fact,
he's the type I hate.

06:45.153 --> 06:47.520
Curtis, what is that?

06:47.553 --> 06:49.855
Gilda's got some recipe
from a magazine...

06:49.889 --> 06:52.824
about putting pineapple
in everything.

06:52.865 --> 06:54.720
She puts pineapple in pineapple.

06:58.562 --> 06:59.708
What you got?

07:00.994 --> 07:02.171
What do you want?

07:03.715 --> 07:06.049
- Mystery meat.
- It's no mystery.

07:12.770 --> 07:15.356
What's that?
Peanut butter again?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.304
Lay off my sandwich.

07:19.075 --> 07:20.985
I don't want that.

07:22.243 --> 07:24.513
- Hey, Thelma.
- Hi, honey.

07:24.547 --> 07:25.757
How's your daughter doing?

07:25.796 --> 07:28.643
She's had
one of them remissions.

07:28.676 --> 07:31.043
If you believe in them.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.377
Thank the Lord I got six others.

07:38.564 --> 07:39.971
Mr. Hurley?

07:40.004 --> 07:41.531
I hear you want the weekend off.

07:41.572 --> 07:43.645
- I know it's late.
- We can't give it to you.

07:43.685 --> 07:45.540
This plant's operating
24 hours a day on a deadline.

07:45.572 --> 07:47.460
- You know that.
- Yeah.

07:47.492 --> 07:49.859
How about if I get somebody
to switch with me?

07:49.893 --> 07:52.032
Most people are working
a double shift now.

07:56.485 --> 07:58.852
So, anyway...

08:00.517 --> 08:03.168
don't everybody
volunteer at once.

08:05.573 --> 08:07.483
We have a revival, Karen.

08:10.854 --> 08:12.742
And you?

08:12.774 --> 08:15.873
Jimmy and me are going
to Oklahoma City for a concert.

08:18.534 --> 08:20.738
Curtis would have a fit.

08:25.543 --> 08:28.096
Promised my kid
I'd take him to Gar Creek.

08:34.855 --> 08:36.863
How about you, Carl?

08:36.903 --> 08:38.659
I got to work myself.

08:41.510 --> 08:44.578
- What the hell was that?
- It's a test.

08:44.616 --> 08:45.990
How do you know?

08:47.272 --> 08:50.501
This is a test.
This is only a test.

08:50.537 --> 08:52.031
You always say that.

08:52.072 --> 08:54.942
You know some poor son
of a bitch got his ass fried.

08:54.985 --> 08:56.807
What I don't get is
how we have all these tests...

08:56.841 --> 08:58.368
but never go through the drill.

08:58.409 --> 09:00.100
If this was a real
airborne contamination...

09:00.137 --> 09:01.828
we're supposed
to get out of here.

09:01.864 --> 09:03.653
We can't do the drill.

09:03.689 --> 09:06.787
It might stop production
for ten minutes.

09:06.825 --> 09:09.159
If it had been the real thing,
they'd shut down the plant...

09:09.193 --> 09:11.527
and I could have had
the whole weekend.

09:17.418 --> 09:20.680
Karen, I've been thinking.

09:20.713 --> 09:23.496
If you'll work
the next shift back-to-back...

09:23.530 --> 09:25.702
I'll switch with you.

09:28.042 --> 09:29.471
Don't tell Curtis, hear?

09:29.514 --> 09:31.205
You mean Curtis
still doesn't like me?

09:31.242 --> 09:33.250
No, but you know how he is.

10:22.702 --> 10:24.556
What are they doing
to that truck?

10:24.589 --> 10:26.182
Move on out, OK?

11:24.464 --> 11:26.188
You coming, or aren't you?

11:34.545 --> 11:36.618
What's there to do down there?

11:36.657 --> 11:39.854
Nothing. There's nothing
to do down there.

11:39.889 --> 11:41.799
All right. I'll come.

11:43.026 --> 11:44.782
She's coming!

11:46.066 --> 11:49.841
It's not going to be a party,
so don't blame me.

12:31.156 --> 12:34.287
It stinks around here.

12:34.325 --> 12:38.154
That's home. That's what I left.

12:48.149 --> 12:50.538
They'll be back
in a little while.

12:50.581 --> 12:52.654
Just went to get some beer.

13:02.325 --> 13:04.235
This is great, Linda.

13:12.150 --> 13:14.387
Come on. Come on in.

13:17.911 --> 13:20.147
Oh, boy.

13:20.183 --> 13:23.412
You look so big.

13:23.447 --> 13:25.814
Go on. Say hi to your mama.

13:26.776 --> 13:28.848
Donny, come here.

13:28.888 --> 13:31.157
Denise, Donny,
come sit over here.

13:31.191 --> 13:33.493
Donny? Donny, come.

13:33.528 --> 13:34.772
It's OK, son. Go ahead.

13:35.927 --> 13:38.197
That's such a pretty dress.

13:38.232 --> 13:40.371
I know. Linda made it for me.

13:41.592 --> 13:44.592
Did you get that baseball
I sent you?

13:44.632 --> 13:46.388
You all remember Drew?

13:49.305 --> 13:53.560
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Where were you, Mama?

13:53.593 --> 13:54.803
I was up near Oklahoma City.
I told you that.

13:54.841 --> 13:57.688
- Are you Mama?
- I'm Mama. That's right.

13:57.721 --> 13:59.957
Mama's going to take you
to the beach for the weekend.

13:59.993 --> 14:01.400
Am I going?

14:01.433 --> 14:04.117
You're going,
and we'll stay in a motel...

14:04.153 --> 14:06.357
and get those little pieces
of soap all wrapped up...

14:06.394 --> 14:07.888
You should have talked to me.

14:07.929 --> 14:11.443
I got the weekend off.
I'm taking them out to Daddy's.

14:13.210 --> 14:14.803
I talked to Linda.

14:14.842 --> 14:16.751
You should have talked to me.

14:23.642 --> 14:25.944
You can take them out
for a while if you want to.

14:31.451 --> 14:33.142
Scoot through.

14:34.203 --> 14:35.959
What am I supposed to eat here?

14:35.995 --> 14:38.167
- French fries.
- Shit.

14:38.203 --> 14:40.756
Don't say that, Dolly.

14:45.211 --> 14:47.284
Donny,
you're not eating anything.

14:47.324 --> 14:50.707
- I've got to use the bathroom.
- Go ahead.

14:50.748 --> 14:52.242
Mom, can I buy a coke?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.138
OK. Here you go.

15:01.244 --> 15:03.962
Drew, you help Tammy.
Nobody'll see her up there.

15:12.029 --> 15:14.583
- I couldn't go.
- You couldn't go.

15:19.581 --> 15:21.785
Do you still sleep with Mama?

15:23.101 --> 15:24.989
Shit!

15:25.021 --> 15:26.931
Don't say that, Mama.

15:26.974 --> 15:28.884
Don't drip it in my fries!

15:34.238 --> 15:36.791
Old McDonald had a farm

15:36.831 --> 15:39.002
E- l-E-l-O

15:39.038 --> 15:40.468
Yeah, here we are.

15:40.511 --> 15:42.966
All right, Tammy,
don't forget your moose.

15:45.887 --> 15:48.822
Drew, help me get her out
of the back seat, will you?

15:48.863 --> 15:52.159
One, two, three!

15:52.191 --> 15:53.621
Good girl!

15:55.391 --> 15:56.668
What you got?

15:58.240 --> 16:01.720
Kiss your mama. That a girl.

16:01.759 --> 16:04.280
I don't want to!

16:04.320 --> 16:07.320
I'll see you next month.

16:07.361 --> 16:08.702
Take them in.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.932
Pete, did you give her
our new address?

16:14.240 --> 16:19.325
All I know is Midland, Texas,
care of the company.

16:19.361 --> 16:21.368
- Midland?
- Yeah.

16:21.409 --> 16:23.776
Big strike near
the New Mexico border.

16:41.346 --> 16:43.386
I just can't picture it.

16:44.834 --> 16:45.947
What?

16:47.779 --> 16:49.819
How long were you
married to him?

16:51.171 --> 16:53.505
You want to hear
something funny?

16:53.539 --> 16:55.262
How about some for the back?

16:59.331 --> 17:02.146
We ran off to get married.

17:02.179 --> 17:06.205
We heard you could get a license
in Louisiana under-age.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.480
But we couldn't,
so we came home...

17:08.515 --> 17:11.385
we told everybody
we got married.

17:11.428 --> 17:14.493
And we never did.

17:14.531 --> 17:16.319
I thought you were divorced.

17:19.556 --> 17:22.622
We're divorced, all right.

17:22.660 --> 17:26.337
How come you got divorced
if you never got married?

17:26.373 --> 17:28.315
Common law.

17:31.173 --> 17:34.239
Goddamn government
fucks you coming and going.

17:44.070 --> 17:49.155
Amazing grace

17:49.189 --> 17:54.460
How sweet the sound

17:54.502 --> 17:57.349
That saved

17:57.382 --> 18:05.118
A wretch like me

18:05.158 --> 18:09.948
I once was lost

18:09.991 --> 18:15.621
But now I'm found

18:15.656 --> 18:18.339
Was bound

18:18.376 --> 18:28.163
But now I'm free

18:36.104 --> 18:38.079
I had them in the car.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.804
I could have just headed
straight for Oklahoma.

18:44.681 --> 18:46.437
What would you
have done with them?

18:53.609 --> 18:54.754
I don't know.

19:23.819 --> 19:25.674
Joe... from the concert.

19:26.859 --> 19:28.931
Hi. What you doing?

19:28.972 --> 19:33.544
We did a job out here
the other night, buried a truck.

19:33.579 --> 19:35.106
Sure you did.

19:35.147 --> 19:36.838
Yeah. We had a hot truck.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.763
We chopped it up, put it
in these little baggies...

19:38.796 --> 19:39.941
and they sent it off
to be buried.

19:39.980 --> 19:42.980
Friday night?
Yeah, I saw that.

19:43.020 --> 19:46.282
Some bozo was here
barking at everybody.

19:46.316 --> 19:47.526
See you.

19:48.684 --> 19:49.862
What did he want?

19:49.900 --> 19:51.809
He's a friend of Wesley's.

19:56.493 --> 19:59.176
My windshield wipers broke.

19:59.213 --> 20:02.759
You think you could ask Drew
to take a look at it?

20:02.797 --> 20:07.205
He's got two cars ahead of you,
but I'll ask him.

20:07.245 --> 20:09.929
Thelma,
your hair looks different.

20:09.965 --> 20:13.282
I gave my daughter my good wig.
Her hair is falling out.

20:13.326 --> 20:15.235
They give her them treatments.

20:19.374 --> 20:21.446
Do you know they're making
my daughter die...

20:21.486 --> 20:23.907
next to a colored person?

20:26.798 --> 20:28.871
Come here. Go like that.

20:30.126 --> 20:31.621
There.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.670
I like your hair
that color, Thelma.

20:33.710 --> 20:36.580
But this here is my bad wig.

20:36.623 --> 20:38.663
It ain't human hair or nothing.

20:42.095 --> 20:44.484
You and Drew
ought to settle down.

20:44.527 --> 20:47.561
Stop people talking about us.

20:47.599 --> 20:50.534
I don't care about that stuff.

20:50.576 --> 20:53.129
- What stuff?
- The pot.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.917
Yeah. The pot.

20:55.952 --> 20:58.440
And the kind of sex.

21:02.256 --> 21:03.914
The kind of sex.

21:09.136 --> 21:11.558
Oh, God.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.007
Gilda, how did it go?

21:15.345 --> 21:19.436
We had to go to my
mother-in-law's after church.

21:19.474 --> 21:21.448
She served up this casserole...

21:21.490 --> 21:23.977
that she'd been
slow cooking for three days.

21:25.361 --> 21:27.249
We've both been
up sick all night.

21:27.282 --> 21:30.096
You were supposed
to work my shift yesterday!

21:30.130 --> 21:34.058
Karen, they shut down.

21:34.098 --> 21:36.848
Say what?

21:36.882 --> 21:39.086
There was a contamination
in our section.

21:40.435 --> 21:41.995
When?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.944
Right after you left.

21:47.795 --> 21:49.617
Karen, I'm not saying this
to upset you...

21:49.650 --> 21:52.717
but you ought to know
they're saying that you did it.

21:54.643 --> 21:55.854
I did it?

21:55.891 --> 21:57.866
They knew you wanted
the weekend off.

21:57.907 --> 21:59.762
Gilda, that is so dumb.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.705
I know.

22:39.573 --> 22:42.126
I hope you enjoyed
your weekend, Karen.

22:44.150 --> 22:46.037
Shit!

22:53.014 --> 22:55.665
Monitor yourself on the way out.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.598
Did you hear about this thing?

23:19.639 --> 23:22.988
Why don't we talk
about it at lunch?

23:23.032 --> 23:25.585
I hate people
talking about me that way.

23:25.624 --> 23:28.788
Then quit and
live on your savings.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.607
Somebody contaminated
your section.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.877
Why would anybody
think I did it?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.433
Whoever did,
it wasn't funny.

23:36.472 --> 23:38.196
I brung your plastic, Drew.

23:38.233 --> 23:39.542
Thanks, Zachary.

23:39.577 --> 23:42.359
You could have done it
a lot easier than I could've.

23:42.393 --> 23:44.597
Anybody could have done it.

23:44.633 --> 23:46.160
Well, it wasn't me!

23:46.201 --> 23:48.657
Here's Quincy.
Here's the head of the union.

23:48.697 --> 23:50.966
Talk to him. The union
will get you out of this.

23:51.002 --> 23:52.376
Yeah, sure, OK.

23:52.410 --> 23:54.101
The company has
got to blame somebody...

23:54.138 --> 23:55.447
otherwise, it's their fault.

23:58.490 --> 24:00.116
What are you looking at,
Zachary?

24:01.850 --> 24:03.760
Get lost, OK?

24:05.850 --> 24:08.917
Karen, you ever thought
of going into politics?

24:44.380 --> 24:46.714
I am really not interested.

24:46.749 --> 24:49.302
Come on. Try Karen.

24:50.909 --> 24:52.435
Asshole.

25:00.382 --> 25:01.975
No! I'm scared!

25:02.013 --> 25:04.828
I'm scared!
I don't want to die. No!

25:04.861 --> 25:07.829
Just stay calm. Come on.

25:19.006 --> 25:20.730
Thelma's cooked.

25:20.766 --> 25:23.548
I said Thelma is cooked.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.176
Shit.

25:27.807 --> 25:29.400
Did they take her
down to decon yet?

25:29.439 --> 25:30.584
I think so.

25:39.775 --> 25:42.459
- You can't go in there.
- Come on, Earl!

25:42.495 --> 25:44.732
Karen! Get on out of there!

25:44.767 --> 25:46.556
She wants me here.

25:48.736 --> 25:50.111
Oh, God!

25:50.144 --> 25:52.511
This is just to take off
the contamination.

25:52.544 --> 25:55.097
I was doing a transfer...

25:55.136 --> 25:57.111
and they must have had
a leak in them!

25:57.152 --> 26:01.244
When I went through
the check, I was hot!

26:02.561 --> 26:04.568
The exposure that you got...

26:04.609 --> 26:06.267
is under
the acceptable body burden.

26:06.305 --> 26:09.207
I'm going to get cancer.
I'm going to die.

26:09.249 --> 26:11.289
Now, Thelma.

26:11.330 --> 26:12.639
I know something about this.

26:12.673 --> 26:14.561
So does Earl know something.

26:14.593 --> 26:17.376
What would he know?
He's a vet.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.133
That's what he was trained at!

26:19.169 --> 26:23.195
Thelma, you're OK. There is
no internal contamination.

26:23.234 --> 26:25.209
There's just a little
external contamination...

26:25.250 --> 26:27.137
and we've taken care
of the problem.

26:30.946 --> 26:33.313
Oh, my skin.

26:33.346 --> 26:35.135
My skin hurts.

26:35.171 --> 26:39.327
Honey, try not to cry.
Salt's going to make it worse.

26:50.180 --> 26:52.700
Hell, you can make money
on any kind of place...

26:52.739 --> 26:54.779
as long as it wasn't
too far from town.

26:54.820 --> 26:57.503
There aren't that many mechanics
who know sports cars.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.263
Where you gonna get the money?

26:59.300 --> 27:01.504
Guess I'll have to sell my body.

27:01.540 --> 27:03.427
I'll give you
five bucks for it...

27:03.460 --> 27:06.111
but I'll think of it
as a charitable contribution.

27:06.148 --> 27:07.675
That's beautiful.

27:07.717 --> 27:09.505
What are you going to
call your place?

27:10.820 --> 27:12.544
Drew's.

27:12.580 --> 27:14.490
That's original.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.420
What's your idea?

27:16.453 --> 27:18.340
Lillian's.

27:18.373 --> 27:21.635
Drew's Car Repair
and Live Bait Dealership.

27:21.669 --> 27:24.572
Thought I'd keep a few worms
for a sideline.

27:24.613 --> 27:27.101
Drew's Car Repair
and Live Bait Dealership.

27:27.141 --> 27:29.051
Rolls right off your tongue.

27:36.614 --> 27:37.727
What is this?

27:40.550 --> 27:41.859
Spaghetti.

27:43.334 --> 27:44.895
Yeah, I can see that.

27:44.934 --> 27:48.513
You wrap this stuff
up in aluminum foil.

27:48.551 --> 27:50.078
You don't even know what it is.

27:50.119 --> 27:52.574
It sits in the refrigerator
and grows cooties.

27:52.615 --> 27:54.273
One third of
the refrigerator is mine.

27:54.311 --> 27:55.970
I can grow cooties
if I want to.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.112
When you do, one third
of the cooties is mine.

27:58.151 --> 27:59.526
Dolly, look at the floor.

27:59.559 --> 28:01.348
It's just seeds, Karen.

28:01.384 --> 28:03.522
I don't care what it is!
I just cleaned up!

28:11.272 --> 28:13.377
See you around the track.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.202
Thelma says
she's going to get cancer.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.735
If anybody's going to get
cancer around here...

28:24.777 --> 28:28.126
it's going to be me,
Dolly Trashbags.

28:28.169 --> 28:30.057
Everything isn't about you.

28:34.121 --> 28:36.063
If anybody around here
is going to get cancer...

28:36.105 --> 28:38.658
we're all going to get cancer.

29:28.236 --> 29:30.625
How long have I been
at Kerr McGee?

29:33.420 --> 29:35.330
Two years in October.

29:43.212 --> 29:45.863
Thelma only got 24 DPMs.

29:48.141 --> 29:49.930
Is that bad?

29:49.965 --> 29:52.300
It's not super bad.

29:54.893 --> 29:57.381
Are you just waking up to this?

29:57.421 --> 30:00.269
You think we're working
with puffed wheat?

30:00.302 --> 30:02.723
I'm just asking a question.

30:02.766 --> 30:05.700
If you're really worried
about it, stop smoking.

30:09.870 --> 30:12.042
Come on. Let's go to bed.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.076
Let's go to bed.

30:23.343 --> 30:24.903
You getting bored with it?

30:42.256 --> 30:43.401
Come on.

31:17.746 --> 31:19.153
Didn't you go to bed yet?

31:28.787 --> 31:31.470
I'm sorry I yelled at you
last night.

31:42.388 --> 31:44.242
I love you, Karen.

31:46.644 --> 31:48.335
I love you, too.

31:50.196 --> 31:52.083
I don't mean "I love you, too."

31:57.205 --> 31:59.310
I know that's not what you mean.

32:01.108 --> 32:02.701
That's what I mean.

32:03.892 --> 32:05.201
We'd better go.

32:13.782 --> 32:16.018
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

32:22.454 --> 32:25.039
I saw Thelma this morning.

32:25.078 --> 32:26.605
Thelma hasn't had
her mind on her work...

32:26.646 --> 32:28.555
since her daughter took sick.

32:28.598 --> 32:31.598
It's terrible what they do
when they scrub a person.

32:31.638 --> 32:35.184
I've been through it.
It ain't so bad.

32:35.222 --> 32:38.518
Did she have just external,
or was it internal?

32:38.550 --> 32:41.682
- Just external.
- They give her a nasal smear?

32:41.719 --> 32:43.694
That's how they tell
about the internal.

32:43.735 --> 32:45.557
No, I don't think so.

32:45.591 --> 32:48.722
Shoot, I knew that!
Why didn't I think of that?

32:48.759 --> 32:50.614
They should've given her
a nasal smear.

32:50.647 --> 32:52.305
You can't think of everything.

32:52.343 --> 32:54.645
Boy, they didn't even
give her a nasal smear!

32:54.679 --> 32:57.527
- Why are you so interested?
- Huh?

32:57.559 --> 33:00.342
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

33:03.672 --> 33:05.744
Karen, I got one for you.

33:08.184 --> 33:10.519
For as long as
anyone could remember...

33:10.552 --> 33:12.374
this Indian chief
was in charge...

33:12.408 --> 33:14.994
of naming all the children
that were born in the tribe.

33:15.032 --> 33:18.829
One day, this brave
comes up to him and says...

33:18.872 --> 33:21.458
"Chief, can I ask you something?

33:21.496 --> 33:23.384
"How do you name these children?

33:23.417 --> 33:26.067
"How do you
think of their names?"

33:26.105 --> 33:29.040
And the chief says,
"It's very simple.

33:29.081 --> 33:30.804
"When a child is born...

33:30.841 --> 33:33.175
"and I see
snow gently falling...

33:33.210 --> 33:37.717
"I say, you shall be called
Snow Gently Falling.

33:37.754 --> 33:41.977
"And when a child is born
and I see a hawk flying over...

33:42.010 --> 33:46.068
"I say, you shall be named
Hawk Flying Over.

33:46.106 --> 33:49.619
"But tell me, Two Dogs Fucking,
why are you so interested?"

34:00.251 --> 34:02.389
That's terrible.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.541
Thelma, did they give you
a nasal smear?

34:08.828 --> 34:10.802
You make them
give you a nasal smear.

34:10.844 --> 34:13.909
They're supposed to.
Make Hurley give you one.

34:13.947 --> 34:16.217
And make him tell you the count!

34:16.252 --> 34:18.139
And make sure
he's telling you the truth...

34:18.172 --> 34:20.725
because there's
a lot of liars around here.

34:25.405 --> 34:26.779
Nice going.

34:34.844 --> 34:36.601
Happy birthday to you

34:36.637 --> 34:38.579
That's beautiful!

34:38.621 --> 34:41.556
It's got my name on it.
Look at that.

34:41.597 --> 34:44.018
- Wait a minute.
- Finally, you're twenty-one.

34:44.061 --> 34:46.003
There's your happy birthday hat.

34:46.045 --> 34:48.893
A happy birthday to you.

34:48.925 --> 34:50.616
A present, too?
This is too much.

34:50.654 --> 34:52.509
Look at the way
they decorated this.

34:52.542 --> 34:54.550
Open it up.

34:54.590 --> 34:55.964
Be careful, Gilda. It's hot.

34:55.998 --> 34:58.038
- Hot?
- I didn't see this.

34:58.078 --> 35:01.307
- Oh, look!
- Look at that!

35:01.342 --> 35:03.895
Check this out, Georgie.

35:03.934 --> 35:05.145
- Take it off.
- Oh, my Lord.

35:05.182 --> 35:09.306
- Panties, too, ma'am.
- Put it on, Gilda.

35:09.343 --> 35:11.677
Oh, my Lord, Curtis'd kill me.

35:11.711 --> 35:14.613
I want to know what's under
them little bows.

35:14.655 --> 35:17.525
Here's your piece.
Goddamn, this cake is just...

35:21.855 --> 35:23.710
It's Gilda's birthday,
Mr. Hurley.

35:23.743 --> 35:25.566
Would you like a piece of cake?

35:25.599 --> 35:27.509
Who brought the cake in?

35:30.976 --> 35:33.081
We are three months late
on this contract.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.324
The day we deliver
the last fuel rod to Hanford...

35:35.360 --> 35:38.044
we'll only be
one million dollars in the hole.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.509
The contract
isn't going to be renewed...

35:39.552 --> 35:43.197
and none of us will have a job.
Even this is taking time.

35:43.232 --> 35:45.469
Clean those crumbs up
after your shift.

37:01.758 --> 37:04.027
You bring one of these
in every week...

37:04.062 --> 37:07.358
and leave it on the shelf
just outside the locker room.

37:07.390 --> 37:09.627
We'll monitor them
for radiation.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.053
I'm supposed
to pee in it at home.

37:13.087 --> 37:14.613
That's right.

37:45.312 --> 37:47.516
My hair feels awful.

37:51.649 --> 37:56.319
I wish I had some of
that conditioner around.

37:59.233 --> 38:02.616
I'm going to call my mama,
tell her to send some up.

38:06.210 --> 38:08.927
She called me the other day.

38:11.233 --> 38:13.143
She said...

38:14.626 --> 38:20.223
"Karen Gay, I been thinking
about your nails."

38:21.378 --> 38:23.287
"How are your nails?"

38:24.866 --> 38:27.736
"You taking care of them?
You been biting them?"

38:32.003 --> 38:35.647
I said, "Oh, boy, I'm taking
good care of them, Mama."

38:37.955 --> 38:41.021
"Don't cut the cuticles, now,
you hear?"

38:42.084 --> 38:44.637
I wish I could
take care of you better.

38:54.596 --> 38:57.117
I remember...

38:57.156 --> 38:59.425
in high school
her saying to me...

38:59.461 --> 39:01.665
"Now, what'd you want
to go and sign up...

39:01.700 --> 39:03.522
"for that science class for?

39:03.557 --> 39:07.037
"There's no girls
in that science class.

39:07.077 --> 39:09.117
"Why don't you take Home Ec?

39:09.157 --> 39:11.546
"That's the way to meet
the nice boys."

39:13.573 --> 39:19.203
I said, "Mama,
there ain't no boys in Home Ec.

39:19.237 --> 39:22.620
"Boys are in the science class."

39:22.662 --> 39:25.215
She hated it
when I said "ain't."

39:26.661 --> 39:29.923
Yakety, yakety, yak.

39:29.958 --> 39:31.103
At least he doesn't talk...

39:31.142 --> 39:33.598
when he doesn't have
something to say.

39:40.743 --> 39:42.150
Who?

39:46.055 --> 39:47.965
My daddy.

40:12.841 --> 40:14.466
Does that hurt?

40:24.265 --> 40:26.818
I can't stay away from you.

40:29.481 --> 40:31.391
You know that.

40:36.905 --> 40:39.524
You can be the biggest bitch
God ever made...

40:39.562 --> 40:41.188
and then you
turn around on me...

40:41.226 --> 40:43.681
and you're like this,
and I want to die.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.914
And the next thing I know...

40:47.946 --> 40:51.492
you decide about me
not having socks on...

40:51.531 --> 40:55.109
the day before,
and you throw a fit.

40:56.363 --> 40:58.272
It's not that, Drew.

41:00.651 --> 41:02.538
- You know.
- I know.

41:06.379 --> 41:08.452
I know what it is.

41:11.467 --> 41:13.409
I know all about you.

41:22.412 --> 41:24.322
You do, don't you?

41:31.405 --> 41:33.161
Poor old Drew.

43:05.842 --> 43:07.369
Haul ass, you guys.

43:07.410 --> 43:10.280
I gotta take my own car.
I'm working a double shift.

43:16.530 --> 43:18.952
This says...

43:18.994 --> 43:23.250
This says all that stuff
about acceptable levels...

43:23.283 --> 43:25.422
it's all bullshit.

43:25.459 --> 43:26.866
What is?

43:28.275 --> 43:30.130
Well, it says here...

43:30.163 --> 43:32.846
"Plutonium gives you cancer."

43:32.884 --> 43:35.251
Says it flat out.

43:35.283 --> 43:37.869
Where'd you get that?

43:37.907 --> 43:41.006
It came in all that union stuff
from Washington.

43:41.044 --> 43:42.538
You got one.
Everybody got one.

43:42.580 --> 43:43.824
Hurley works there.

43:43.860 --> 43:45.682
Think he'd work there
if he was going to get cancer?

43:45.716 --> 43:50.474
Listen to this...
"genetic damage."

43:50.517 --> 43:51.826
Meaning what?

43:51.860 --> 43:54.860
Meaning it goes on down
into your kids.

43:54.901 --> 43:56.689
It says here...

43:58.581 --> 44:01.614
"Gross physical
and mental defects."

44:01.653 --> 44:03.562
I already got them.

44:11.061 --> 44:13.451
Boy, I missed you.

44:16.662 --> 44:18.484
How many more nights
you gotta work?

44:18.517 --> 44:19.794
A couple.

44:21.814 --> 44:24.181
You got transferred.

44:24.214 --> 44:25.294
I what?

44:25.335 --> 44:28.401
Posted it this morning
as I was leaving.

44:28.438 --> 44:30.348
You're in metallography.

44:31.318 --> 44:33.173
What?

44:33.207 --> 44:35.858
- Metallography?
- That's what it said.

44:35.895 --> 44:40.467
That'll take me three months
to requalify for overtime!

44:40.503 --> 44:43.951
Shit! I love that!

44:43.991 --> 44:46.195
Hurley throws a fit how
we're late on the contracts...

44:46.231 --> 44:47.726
then he transfers me out?

44:47.768 --> 44:49.077
The union going
to help me out now?

44:49.112 --> 44:52.789
I'm one of
the best people he's got.

44:52.824 --> 44:55.726
I got transferred
to metallography.

44:55.768 --> 44:58.801
Metallography, with Winston?

45:01.561 --> 45:03.251
Now...

45:04.504 --> 45:06.392
them little gray pellets
you've been making...

45:06.424 --> 45:09.108
are put into
those long fuel rods...

45:09.145 --> 45:12.494
and the long fuel rods
are packed into bundles...

45:12.536 --> 45:16.879
over at
your friend Drew's section.

45:16.921 --> 45:21.395
And after the weld is made,
they take a slice out of it...

45:21.433 --> 45:23.953
and they make a cross section.

45:23.994 --> 45:25.849
So, what your job is...

45:25.881 --> 45:29.078
is to mount
that cross section over here.

45:33.050 --> 45:37.174
And then you grind it,
and you polish it.

45:37.210 --> 45:40.756
And here's where
you take a picture of it.

45:40.794 --> 45:43.380
And then you develop it
in the darkroom.

45:43.418 --> 45:46.801
Then I inspect the negative for
any imperfections in the weld...

45:46.842 --> 45:49.461
and if it's OK,
we pass on that lot...

45:49.499 --> 45:52.533
and they get shipped out.

45:57.083 --> 45:59.767
You're familiar
with developing procedure?

46:02.715 --> 46:04.308
Yeah. I am.

46:07.164 --> 46:09.171
I got some pictures in here.

46:09.212 --> 46:11.514
They're all backed up, so...

46:11.548 --> 46:12.792
why don't you
get to work on them...

46:12.828 --> 46:15.675
and then tomorrow
I'll be glad...

46:15.708 --> 46:18.043
to go over the polishing
procedure with you.

46:20.125 --> 46:21.619
Great.

46:45.086 --> 46:46.679
What are you doing?

46:50.366 --> 46:52.373
I'm looking at you.

46:52.415 --> 46:55.262
What are you doing
to the negative?

46:55.295 --> 46:57.302
Sometimes when
you take a picture...

46:57.342 --> 46:59.230
you get these
white spots in there...

46:59.262 --> 47:01.172
so we make them go away.

47:03.583 --> 47:06.747
Doesn't somebody have to look
at them to make sure they're OK?

47:08.159 --> 47:09.948
Me.

47:09.983 --> 47:11.674
Yeah, but I mean...

47:13.119 --> 47:16.894
- You mean what?
- How do you...

47:16.928 --> 47:22.198
How do you know if
they're just spots?

47:22.239 --> 47:24.149
They could be defects
in the weld.

47:24.192 --> 47:28.502
No, no, no.
I've already checked the weld.

47:28.545 --> 47:31.228
I'm just putting
beauty marks on them.

47:31.265 --> 47:34.134
Winston,
get away with that thing.

47:39.809 --> 47:41.533
Thank you.

47:41.569 --> 47:46.206
I just want to bring y'all
up to date.

47:46.241 --> 47:48.216
Some of you
weren't here last time...

47:48.258 --> 47:50.746
and some of you
who were here last time...

47:50.786 --> 47:53.175
aren't here this time,
that's for damn sure.

47:54.754 --> 47:59.391
Now, three weeks ago...

47:59.426 --> 48:02.558
the company got enough names
on this petition...

48:02.594 --> 48:06.173
to hold
a decertification election.

48:06.210 --> 48:09.276
I know you all
are confused about this.

48:09.315 --> 48:10.591
What this means is...

48:10.627 --> 48:16.257
that the National
Labor Relations Board...

48:16.291 --> 48:18.266
will come in here
and hold an election...

48:18.307 --> 48:24.188
where everybody votes whether
to certify or decertify...

48:24.228 --> 48:26.617
the union's staying on
in this plant.

48:28.356 --> 48:30.178
Morgan, did I do that right?

48:32.420 --> 48:34.787
What this means...

48:34.820 --> 48:37.340
is that we are in deep shit.

48:39.684 --> 48:44.224
What this means is,
if we lose this election...

48:44.260 --> 48:47.577
there ain't going to be
any union at this plant.

48:47.621 --> 48:51.483
Nobody standing up for us
against Kerr McGee...

48:51.524 --> 48:54.045
which I read
in the newspapers...

48:54.085 --> 48:58.209
is gonna take in
$1.5 billion this year.

48:59.654 --> 49:01.509
And which, as you all know...

49:01.541 --> 49:03.930
takes about as much time
thinking about our problems...

49:03.973 --> 49:05.981
as grease takes
to go through a goose.

49:08.678 --> 49:11.099
We gotta do
a lot of work...

49:11.142 --> 49:13.727
between now and
the election in October.

49:13.766 --> 49:15.173
We lost a lot of members...

49:15.206 --> 49:17.029
since the strike
didn't work out last year.

49:17.062 --> 49:20.608
So now I want to know...

49:20.646 --> 49:22.719
who can help me?

49:28.551 --> 49:30.373
They said if you're really
worried about it...

49:30.407 --> 49:32.927
you're welcome to get involved.

49:32.967 --> 49:35.455
You could be on the committee.

49:35.495 --> 49:37.862
What committee?

49:37.896 --> 49:39.652
Negotiating committee.

49:40.743 --> 49:43.264
- You?
- Yeah.

49:43.304 --> 49:45.311
On the union
negotiating committee.

49:48.936 --> 49:51.008
Karen, let me give you a hint.

49:51.048 --> 49:53.895
Don't flash 'em.

49:53.928 --> 49:55.389
It turns you on.

49:55.433 --> 49:57.287
Yeah, but I'm not management.

49:57.320 --> 50:00.168
- I'm as smart as Hurley is.
- Just as tactful.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.819
You sound like my mother.

50:02.857 --> 50:05.540
You don't just stand
toe to toe with someone...

50:05.577 --> 50:08.447
call him a motherfucker,
and get anywhere.

50:09.705 --> 50:11.647
I'll keep it in mind.

50:43.371 --> 50:44.581
Do you...

50:45.867 --> 50:48.071
Do you feel different
about me...

50:49.196 --> 50:51.268
since I got cooked?

50:58.251 --> 51:00.455
What do you mean?

51:00.492 --> 51:01.921
You know.

51:07.276 --> 51:09.065
Well...

51:10.636 --> 51:13.418
I still want to fuck you.

51:13.453 --> 51:16.203
I sure as hell don't want
to fuck Thelma anymore.

51:18.701 --> 51:20.905
Oh, Jesus.

51:29.358 --> 51:30.732
I'll give you something.

51:35.502 --> 51:38.316
- Where are they?
- They're next door.

51:50.383 --> 51:52.041
Oh, God.

52:31.569 --> 52:33.806
Think you made
enough noise there, Dolly?

52:35.761 --> 52:39.471
You two ain't exactly
a silent movie yourself.

52:43.730 --> 52:47.341
This here is Angela.
She's a beautician.

52:49.330 --> 52:50.507
Well, hi there.

53:22.932 --> 53:26.248
Personally, I don't see
anything wrong with it.

53:26.292 --> 53:28.202
No. Neither do I.

53:31.380 --> 53:33.485
Guess it figures, doesn't it?

53:34.581 --> 53:37.069
I can handle it.

53:37.109 --> 53:38.451
Me, too.

53:40.085 --> 53:42.671
So why are we talking about it?

54:10.967 --> 54:12.854
What if we wrote them?

54:14.870 --> 54:16.496
What if we wrote
the national union...

54:16.534 --> 54:17.909
told them
what's going on down here?

54:17.942 --> 54:19.830
Maybe they'd help us.

54:19.862 --> 54:22.732
We're not going to win
the election by ourselves.

54:24.183 --> 54:26.288
We gotta do something,
I think.

54:26.328 --> 54:28.335
Management is putting up
these memos now...

54:28.375 --> 54:30.164
saying no union business
on our breaks.

54:30.199 --> 54:32.022
That's our own time, Quincy.

54:32.055 --> 54:36.976
Yeah. They think they can
get away with anything.

54:37.016 --> 54:39.023
I'll see you in the morning.

54:42.648 --> 54:44.918
Sounds like they're trying
to get rid of you.

54:44.952 --> 54:48.018
They're going to get
a big fight if they try.

54:49.209 --> 54:51.729
Karen, you ever been downtown?

54:51.769 --> 54:53.329
There are two big streets.

54:53.368 --> 54:56.435
One's called Kerr,
and one's called McGee.

54:56.473 --> 54:58.262
And that's how I see it.

54:58.297 --> 54:59.475
They own the state...

54:59.513 --> 55:01.488
they own everybody
in this state...

55:01.529 --> 55:05.272
and they own practically
everybody I work on.

55:11.961 --> 55:13.871
What do you think?

55:14.970 --> 55:18.865
What kind of
make-up base do you use?

55:18.906 --> 55:20.979
The kind I always use.

55:24.922 --> 55:29.560
I don't mind somebody taking
my beers if they replace it.

55:29.594 --> 55:31.766
You're making a big deal
out of everything lately.

55:31.803 --> 55:33.810
Everything's going to hell
around here.

55:33.851 --> 55:35.028
Meaning you're out of beer?

55:35.067 --> 55:37.456
Meaning you're on
the goddamn phone night and day.

55:39.483 --> 55:40.760
Heavy.

55:44.124 --> 55:45.717
What did you do to your face?

55:45.756 --> 55:47.698
Doesn't she look great?

55:47.739 --> 55:50.227
Looks like a fucking corpse.

55:51.388 --> 55:53.624
That's not very nice.

55:53.660 --> 55:56.693
It's not very nice to make fun
of what a person does.

55:56.732 --> 56:01.620
If that's what a beautician
does, I'll take mine rare.

56:01.661 --> 56:06.036
Drew, Angela works at Thayer's.

56:08.381 --> 56:09.690
Funeral home?

56:14.814 --> 56:17.148
Hell, why didn't you say so?

56:19.421 --> 56:22.585
Drew, I can always tell...

56:22.622 --> 56:25.818
when a dead person I beautify
worked for Kerr McGee...

56:25.854 --> 56:30.010
because they all look like
they died before they died.

56:38.911 --> 56:41.660
Why don't you lay off her?

56:41.695 --> 56:43.964
Jesus Christ.

56:47.391 --> 56:51.166
I bet there's something to that.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.922
To what?

56:52.960 --> 56:57.237
About people looking like
they died before they died.

56:57.279 --> 56:59.221
You know, plutonium and all.

57:32.514 --> 57:34.107
Drew, what's your opinion?

57:35.361 --> 57:38.623
It's fine.
The other one was fine, too.

57:38.658 --> 57:40.545
They're all fine.

57:40.578 --> 57:42.171
Honey, this is really important.

57:42.210 --> 57:43.933
This is a meeting
with the national union...

57:43.970 --> 57:45.759
and the Atomic Energy
Commission.

57:45.794 --> 57:47.169
The national union is paying...

57:47.202 --> 57:49.307
for our plane tickets
and our hotel room.

57:49.347 --> 57:50.940
He's just jealous.

57:50.978 --> 57:52.734
Is this meeting
in Washington state...

57:52.771 --> 57:54.297
or Washington, D. C?

57:54.339 --> 57:55.484
D.C.

57:55.522 --> 57:57.627
The one you got on
is much better.

57:57.667 --> 58:01.082
OK. I will wear this
to the AEC.

58:01.123 --> 58:03.295
And what shall I wear
on the plane?

58:03.331 --> 58:05.186
Something that won't wrinkle.

58:05.220 --> 58:08.536
Like a shroud, maybe.

58:08.579 --> 58:11.776
I get so tired of your jokes.

58:17.251 --> 58:19.673
Sir, would you mind
putting your tray down, please?

58:21.540 --> 58:23.267
Thank you.

58:23.396 --> 58:24.673
Thank you.

58:27.460 --> 58:28.987
Thank you.

58:29.028 --> 58:32.324
Miss, how much is this?

58:32.356 --> 58:33.731
It comes with your ticket.

58:46.246 --> 58:48.667
We're going to
union headquarters first...

58:48.710 --> 58:52.026
and you'll meet Max Richter,
who runs our Washington office.

58:52.069 --> 58:55.004
Then we'll go over what
you're telling the AEC tomorrow.

58:55.045 --> 58:57.151
Is the company going to
find out about this?

58:57.190 --> 58:59.492
It's highly unlikely.

58:59.526 --> 59:03.105
Whenever the AEC Inspector
comes to the plant...

59:03.142 --> 59:06.044
anybody says anything to him,
the company finds out.

59:06.087 --> 59:09.632
Yeah, right.
Maybe you could bring that up.

59:09.671 --> 59:11.362
Could we stop over there?

59:11.399 --> 59:15.174
Excuse me.
Could we stop? Please?

59:15.207 --> 59:18.338
Yeah. Sure. OK.

59:19.719 --> 59:22.753
Look this way. Straight ahead.

59:22.791 --> 59:25.246
Yeah, that's good. Perfect.

59:26.664 --> 59:29.446
Bobby Beckwith
tore a hole in his glove.

59:29.480 --> 59:32.709
Let me see
if I can read this here.

59:32.744 --> 59:34.653
I think it says July the 23rd.

59:34.696 --> 59:37.380
Isn't that about right, Morgan?

59:37.416 --> 59:41.345
Yeah. That was right before
Karen came back...

59:41.384 --> 59:44.680
and they tried to pin
the contamination on her.

59:44.713 --> 59:52.002
The plutonium soaked through
his coveralls to his arm.

59:52.041 --> 59:54.146
What the hell
is going on out there?

59:54.185 --> 59:59.368
It's National "Something" Day.

01:00:01.674 --> 01:00:04.292
Can't breathe.

01:00:04.329 --> 01:00:07.559
- What?
- Can't breathe.

01:00:07.594 --> 01:00:12.351
There's a lot of stuff here
about the respirators.

01:00:12.394 --> 01:00:14.369
We get these contaminations...

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.956
and sometimes
we got to wear these masks...

01:00:17.995 --> 01:00:21.126
for a week, 10 days,
sometimes 12 hours a day.

01:00:21.162 --> 01:00:22.657
Are you working 12 hours?

01:00:22.699 --> 01:00:26.114
They're late on the contract.
Running double shifts.

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:29.002
And they got us working
in these respirators...

01:00:29.035 --> 01:00:32.330
and I want to tell you,
it gets real hot.

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:34.305
And they don't fit.

01:00:34.347 --> 01:00:36.355
I mean, mine doesn't fit.

01:00:36.396 --> 01:00:39.429
What you people have
brought in today is wonderful.

01:00:39.468 --> 01:00:45.349
Excuse me.
I just wanted to say one thing.

01:00:45.388 --> 01:00:47.755
That was the thing
about the showers.

01:00:47.788 --> 01:00:52.458
There are only two showers
for 75 workers per shift.

01:00:52.492 --> 01:00:58.657
And it's not really clean.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.312
Everybody wanted me
to say something about that.

01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:06.604
Right. It's probably best
if we stick to the stuff...

01:01:06.637 --> 01:01:08.164
that's really connected
with the radiation.

01:01:11.853 --> 01:01:14.057
What about
that contaminated truck?

01:01:14.094 --> 01:01:16.745
They cut up this hot truck
and buried it.

01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:18.407
Right.
That was in your letter.

01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:21.129
I've got to catch my plane.
Paul will take care of you.

01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:22.989
The only way
we can get enough votes...

01:01:23.022 --> 01:01:24.844
to keep the union
in your plant...

01:01:24.878 --> 01:01:27.267
is on the health
and safety issue.

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:30.507
So we'll get a couple of
hotshot doctors in to speak.

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:32.648
You keep telling
Paul all this stuff.

01:01:32.687 --> 01:01:35.054
And try to get
everything clear...

01:01:35.087 --> 01:01:37.607
for the AEC tomorrow,
all right?

01:01:37.646 --> 01:01:40.778
I'll be back in a second.

01:01:40.815 --> 01:01:42.244
Max?

01:01:44.816 --> 01:01:47.685
I'm going to go find
a restroom.

01:01:54.526 --> 01:01:57.658
Excuse me.
There's one more thing.

01:01:57.694 --> 01:02:00.246
I work in metallography.
In X-rays.

01:02:00.286 --> 01:02:04.148
And sometimes we...

01:02:04.189 --> 01:02:07.484
Quite frankly,
we have negatives altered.

01:02:10.302 --> 01:02:13.203
The negatives of the welds
in the fuel rods.

01:02:13.245 --> 01:02:17.501
They take a weld
and cross section it.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:20.631
Then they photograph it,
and there's a defect.

01:02:20.668 --> 01:02:24.346
Then they just touch it up.

01:02:24.381 --> 01:02:26.268
Touch it up?

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:30.578
With a Pentel pen.
Right on the negatives.

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.962
They fill in the white spots.

01:02:31.996 --> 01:02:34.200
You're talking about
X- rays of fuel rods?

01:02:34.237 --> 01:02:36.985
The fuel rods
they're sending up to that...

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:40.217
We're sending up to
that breeder reactor...

01:02:40.252 --> 01:02:42.838
they're testing in Hanford.

01:02:42.876 --> 01:02:45.723
Do you know what that means?

01:02:45.755 --> 01:02:48.057
I know they shouldn't do it.

01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:50.033
Excuse us.

01:02:50.075 --> 01:02:52.945
Why don't we go in there?

01:02:55.995 --> 01:02:57.653
In an ordinary nuclear plant...

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.960
you can have meltdowns,
poisonous gas, and dead people.

01:02:59.995 --> 01:03:03.791
That's nothing compared to what
can go wrong with a breeder.

01:03:03.834 --> 01:03:07.697
You put defective fuel rods
in a breeder reactor...

01:03:07.739 --> 01:03:11.601
for all we know, the whole
state could be wiped out.

01:03:11.642 --> 01:03:13.813
Can you get
documentation of that?

01:03:16.986 --> 01:03:18.513
I guess so.

01:03:18.554 --> 01:03:22.066
If you could get documentation,
that would be very important.

01:03:22.105 --> 01:03:25.105
We'll set you up with a reporter
from the "New York Times"...

01:03:25.145 --> 01:03:28.014
get the company up against
the wall on negotiations.

01:03:28.056 --> 01:03:30.479
But you'd have to have
documentation.

01:03:30.522 --> 01:03:33.238
I don't know about putting
names in the newspaper.

01:03:33.273 --> 01:03:34.483
Names aren't the point.

01:03:34.521 --> 01:03:36.855
The point is
that if you're right...

01:03:36.889 --> 01:03:38.579
they could kill off
two million people.

01:03:38.616 --> 01:03:43.123
There's a moral imperative
involved here.

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:50.896
Think about it.
Talk to Paul.

01:03:50.936 --> 01:03:52.911
You look like a standup girl.

01:03:52.952 --> 01:03:54.578
I'll be right there.

01:04:09.943 --> 01:04:13.587
I've never seen
so many bands in my life.

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:33.459
All right,
we're going to go over...

01:04:33.493 --> 01:04:35.054
your statements
for the AEC meeting.

01:04:35.094 --> 01:04:38.225
And later, you and I
will go through yours.

01:04:43.094 --> 01:04:46.126
There was 23 people there,
including us.

01:04:46.165 --> 01:04:47.277
Of course, I couldn't
take any pictures...

01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:49.106
while the meeting
was going on.

01:04:49.142 --> 01:04:51.508
Just imagine
all these old geezers...

01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:53.429
sitting there,
pitchers of water...

01:04:53.462 --> 01:04:55.086
and they all looked so bored.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.678
It's like they had
heard it all before.

01:04:57.717 --> 01:05:01.514
I think the union's
really going to help us now.

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:04.370
That doesn't
belong in here at all.

01:05:04.404 --> 01:05:08.845
That's one of them slides
you can buy.

01:05:08.885 --> 01:05:11.700
Oh, hell. May, did you
put them in this order?

01:05:11.732 --> 01:05:14.699
I didn't touch them, Quincy.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.515
There's the Lincoln Memorial,
of course.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:20.303
That's where we stayed.

01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:22.379
I couldn't get it
all in the picture.

01:05:24.563 --> 01:05:27.018
You could get dinner
in your room if you wanted...

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.547
but we didn't.

01:05:31.955 --> 01:05:34.322
I had one of the waiters
take this one.

01:05:34.355 --> 01:05:36.876
Who's that guy?

01:05:36.915 --> 01:05:39.435
That's Paul Stone.
He works for the union.

01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:44.653
This is on the way
to the airport.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.545
And that's the White House.

01:05:46.578 --> 01:05:48.554
I wanted to take a picture
of ol' Gerry Ford...

01:05:48.595 --> 01:05:52.075
cooking his English muffin,
but they wouldn't let us in.

01:06:03.313 --> 01:06:05.614
How many people know about
you going to Washington?

01:06:05.649 --> 01:06:08.965
Only the people in that room.

01:06:09.009 --> 01:06:11.726
Quincy and Morgan
know about your spying?

01:06:14.033 --> 01:06:15.309
No.

01:06:19.473 --> 01:06:21.742
People are going
to lose jobs, Karen.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:24.712
Some of them ought to.

01:06:24.753 --> 01:06:27.086
There's a moral imperative here.

01:06:31.185 --> 01:06:34.184
You going to put
some big story in the papers?

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:35.306
In the "New York Times."

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.440
In the "New York Times."

01:06:41.679 --> 01:06:44.429
Guess that about ties
the package up with a bow.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.684
What's the matter with him?

01:07:26.254 --> 01:07:29.220
Some guy in Washington
I should have told him about.

01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:33.090
- Is that all?
- No.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.990
What you doing?

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:57.249
Thinking.

01:08:07.339 --> 01:08:10.057
Thinking. Drinking.

01:08:14.539 --> 01:08:15.782
I was just thinking...

01:08:15.819 --> 01:08:18.305
if you'd ever quit
and come away with me.

01:08:23.594 --> 01:08:26.594
Well, I can't quit now.

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:29.950
That's what I was thinking.

01:08:40.872 --> 01:08:43.077
It's cold out here.

01:08:43.113 --> 01:08:45.765
Come on inside.

01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:47.263
I quit.

01:08:52.233 --> 01:08:54.120
You what?

01:08:54.153 --> 01:08:56.520
This afternoon.
Gave my notice.

01:08:56.553 --> 01:08:58.942
- You quit?
- That's what I said.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:05.182
This afternoon?

01:09:08.073 --> 01:09:10.145
Why didn't you tell me?

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.523
I don't know.
I just didn't tell you.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:23.836
Why'd you quit?

01:09:26.728 --> 01:09:30.076
I just don't give a shit.

01:09:39.687 --> 01:09:42.108
You don't give a shit
if everybody in the plant...

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:44.255
is being poisoned?

01:10:06.278 --> 01:10:09.474
Don't give me a problem
I can't solve.

01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:55.682
Did you take
the Waylon Jennings tapes?

01:10:55.714 --> 01:10:57.603
I left them for you.

01:10:57.635 --> 01:11:00.285
They're yours.
You can take them.

01:11:01.954 --> 01:11:04.322
You can keep them, Karen.

01:11:10.594 --> 01:11:12.220
Take it easy, Dolly.

01:11:42.656 --> 01:11:45.373
Drew, come on. Stay.

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:50.429
Sweetheart, it's like
you're two people.

01:11:50.463 --> 01:11:52.253
I'm in love
with one of them...

01:11:52.288 --> 01:11:53.978
but the other one's...

01:11:54.015 --> 01:11:57.276
Just a general pain in the ass.

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:37.846
I loved it, baby.

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:48.751
What are you doing in there?

01:13:56.857 --> 01:14:00.305
What are you doing in my desk?

01:14:00.345 --> 01:14:03.792
If I tell you, you'll promise
not to tell anybody?

01:14:07.033 --> 01:14:09.967
I keep my pills in there,
in that drawer...

01:14:10.008 --> 01:14:12.725
because I have an allergy...

01:14:12.761 --> 01:14:15.859
and they don't let you bring
medication into the plant...

01:14:15.896 --> 01:14:18.002
so I hid them in there.

01:14:19.736 --> 01:14:21.972
I don't believe you.

01:14:23.481 --> 01:14:27.822
I think you should take
a person's word for something.

01:14:56.727 --> 01:14:59.574
These don't look like
antihistamines to me.

01:15:01.015 --> 01:15:04.494
Winston,
you know what these are?

01:15:04.534 --> 01:15:09.007
These are little
tiny time capsules...

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:12.940
like the ones you see on TV.

01:15:12.981 --> 01:15:15.054
They clear up
your nasal passages...

01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:18.410
for up to 12 hours straight.

01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:27.946
- Excuse me.
- God bless you.

01:15:29.878 --> 01:15:32.332
In the coal mines years ago...

01:15:32.372 --> 01:15:36.115
they used to put canaries
in the tunnels.

01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:38.352
If the canaries dropped dead...

01:15:38.388 --> 01:15:40.363
they knew there was a gas leak.

01:15:42.452 --> 01:15:45.267
But it's a brand-new industry...

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.983
so you're the canaries.

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:51.054
The trouble is, you're not going
to drop dead right away.

01:15:51.092 --> 01:15:53.993
It might take ten years.
Twenty. We don't know.

01:15:54.035 --> 01:16:01.105
Here's what we know...
plutonium causes cancer.

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:02.546
Anybody tells you
we don't know...

01:16:02.579 --> 01:16:05.480
how much plutonium
causes cancer, they're lying.

01:16:05.522 --> 01:16:07.312
What we don't know...

01:16:07.348 --> 01:16:11.623
is how little plutonium
causes cancer.

01:16:11.666 --> 01:16:13.194
The government says...

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.852
that the maximum
permissible body burden...

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:18.640
for your lifetime
is 40 nanocuries.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.431
Let me tell you
how much that is.

01:16:20.466 --> 01:16:25.703
That is a tiny dot
on a piece of paper.

01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:30.700
We say that's too much.

01:16:30.738 --> 01:16:36.782
We say that it takes
less than that to kill you.

01:16:36.818 --> 01:16:39.436
We don't say
it's twice too much...

01:16:39.473 --> 01:16:41.360
or three times too much.

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:48.037
We think that that is
115,000 times too much.

01:16:49.393 --> 01:16:53.321
A pollen-sized
grain of plutonium...

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.656
injected in mice
causes cancer.

01:16:56.688 --> 01:17:01.642
When you inhale it,
and it lodges in your lungs...

01:17:01.681 --> 01:17:05.096
you're married to cancer.

01:17:05.136 --> 01:17:07.886
We've been through
all the training literature...

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.919
Kerr McGee hands out
to new employees...

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:14.276
and there's nothing
about cancer.

01:17:14.319 --> 01:17:20.712
Did management give you
any literature about cancer?

01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:23.784
Then you get contaminated,
and they tell you...

01:17:23.822 --> 01:17:25.645
you've had an acceptable level
of contamination.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.875
I say there's no such thing.

01:17:30.958 --> 01:17:32.933
There must be some questions.

01:17:38.766 --> 01:17:42.922
Is there any way to get
the plutonium out of you...

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:47.049
if it's inside your lungs?

01:17:47.086 --> 01:17:51.821
You can take the lung out,
but that's a little extreme.

01:18:01.742 --> 01:18:03.596
You want to get
something to eat?

01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:05.635
Very nice meeting you.

01:18:05.677 --> 01:18:07.499
Have a good night.

01:18:07.533 --> 01:18:09.573
That was great.

01:18:09.613 --> 01:18:11.946
The union is really in solid.

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:13.868
We don't have to worry about...

01:18:13.901 --> 01:18:16.584
How come why didn't we hear
any of this before?

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.310
And we didn't see
any of you guys...

01:18:18.347 --> 01:18:23.782
until they decided
to vote the union out or not?

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:24.932
If you're
so worried about us...

01:18:24.972 --> 01:18:26.216
where the hell were you
in the beginning?

01:18:26.252 --> 01:18:28.521
What we're saying
is you need someone...

01:18:28.556 --> 01:18:30.181
Iooking out for
your health and safety.

01:18:30.219 --> 01:18:31.943
The company says
they're taking care of you.

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.124
Do you believe that?

01:18:33.163 --> 01:18:35.171
- Yeah. I believe that.
- You do?

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:37.152
You're the only guy
in that room that still does.

01:18:37.194 --> 01:18:39.050
Let me tell you something else.

01:18:39.084 --> 01:18:41.417
Doesn't matter if you work
on plutonium or dog food...

01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:43.011
because
they won't give you a thing.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:46.150
There's nowhere left to go.
You start causing problems...

01:18:46.187 --> 01:18:49.962
and Kerr McGee shuts
that plant down, then what?

01:18:49.995 --> 01:18:53.028
You're up in Washington, D.C.

01:18:53.066 --> 01:18:56.449
We're down here out of work.

01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:59.392
Your cancer is a maybe.
That's all it is.

01:19:07.369 --> 01:19:09.759
- He's just scared.
- Yeah.

01:19:09.802 --> 01:19:11.395
The meeting was really good.

01:19:11.433 --> 01:19:16.168
Yeah, look...
I got an early plane, Karen.

01:19:16.202 --> 01:19:18.208
Meaning what?

01:19:18.249 --> 01:19:22.341
I don't think this is smart,
us getting involved.

01:19:22.377 --> 01:19:24.897
We already got involved.

01:19:52.424 --> 01:19:54.976
Hi. This is Paul Stone.

01:19:55.015 --> 01:19:56.128
I'm out right now...

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:58.502
but if you leave
a message after the beep...

01:19:58.535 --> 01:20:01.284
I'll get back to you.

01:20:01.318 --> 01:20:03.741
Hi, this is Karen.

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:09.088
I just wanted
to let you know...

01:20:09.127 --> 01:20:13.218
that we won
the union election 80 to 61...

01:20:13.254 --> 01:20:16.288
and I'm real happy.

01:20:19.749 --> 01:20:21.660
It's real hard
to keep calling you...

01:20:21.703 --> 01:20:23.426
from a pay phone
if you're never there...

01:20:23.462 --> 01:20:27.837
so that's why
I'm calling you from here.

01:20:29.445 --> 01:20:32.740
I have some things that...

01:20:32.774 --> 01:20:34.203
I really need
to talk to you about...

01:20:34.245 --> 01:20:36.895
and I just wish
that I could talk to you.

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:41.308
Been under a lot
of pressure here, boy.

01:20:41.349 --> 01:20:43.770
It's great
we won and everything...

01:20:43.812 --> 01:20:47.075
but just...

01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:50.753
Been under really
a lot of pressure, and...

01:20:50.789 --> 01:20:53.058
I don't know.
I feel like I'm...

01:20:58.245 --> 01:21:00.545
All alone.

01:21:04.612 --> 01:21:07.459
Guess you didn't hear
that last part.

01:21:22.692 --> 01:21:25.146
Come on!

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:30.203
Do you want coffee?

01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:52.219
I went to make popcorn
last night...

01:21:52.258 --> 01:21:53.850
and there's no Wesson oil.

01:21:53.889 --> 01:21:55.994
So, go get some.

01:21:56.034 --> 01:21:57.560
I'm not in charge
of the Wesson oil...

01:21:57.601 --> 01:21:59.195
I'm not in charge
of the shopping.

01:21:59.233 --> 01:22:01.272
I can't do it every time.

01:22:01.313 --> 01:22:04.542
I can't do it this afternoon.
I got a union meeting.

01:22:04.576 --> 01:22:06.005
If you're
talking like that...

01:22:06.049 --> 01:22:07.706
to impress that
outside agitator of yours...

01:22:07.744 --> 01:22:09.173
he ain't here,
so cut the shit.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:12.151
We can't do the shopping
unless you give us your key.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.142
What happened to your key?

01:22:17.185 --> 01:22:19.518
If we knew that,
we wouldn't need yours.

01:22:19.552 --> 01:22:23.414
- I lost it.
- You lost it.

01:22:25.823 --> 01:22:27.416
Leave it under the step.

01:22:27.456 --> 01:22:30.270
What if somebody rapes me
because you lost your key?

01:22:30.303 --> 01:22:33.237
Who's going to rape you
that you ain't already fucked?

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:48.633
- Hiya, Thelma.
- Hi, honey.

01:22:51.421 --> 01:22:53.724
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:56.311
I was trying to get
blood for my daughter...

01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:59.765
and Hurley said asking
people at the plant...

01:22:59.806 --> 01:23:02.041
is against union rules.

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:05.013
Oh, yeah? He said that?

01:23:09.821 --> 01:23:13.847
The workers in this plant...

01:23:13.885 --> 01:23:16.787
have certified us
as their representatives...

01:23:16.829 --> 01:23:20.603
so we should get started
on some real negotiations.

01:23:20.636 --> 01:23:22.579
I talked to the lawyer
last week downtown.

01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:26.003
He said he'd get back
to me on Monday.

01:23:26.045 --> 01:23:27.637
You said that last week.

01:23:27.676 --> 01:23:31.386
He hasn't gotten back to me yet.

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:33.526
Excuse me.

01:23:33.564 --> 01:23:39.128
Mr. Hurley, did you tell
an employee in wet processing...

01:23:39.163 --> 01:23:42.676
that it was against
union rules to give blood?

01:23:44.508 --> 01:23:46.296
I don't recall saying that, no.

01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:49.909
Good. Because I just called
the bloodmobile...

01:23:49.947 --> 01:23:52.151
and they can come over
on Tuesday.

01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:00.982
No, don't wake them up.

01:24:01.019 --> 01:24:02.579
Just...

01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:07.377
Tell them I called again.

01:24:07.419 --> 01:24:08.978
And...

01:24:10.202 --> 01:24:12.755
Tell them Mama's OK...

01:24:12.795 --> 01:24:16.504
and I love them...

01:24:16.538 --> 01:24:17.684
and I miss them...

01:24:17.723 --> 01:24:20.820
and I'll come see them
as soon as I can.

01:24:20.858 --> 01:24:23.411
Yeah, I know.
I'm not always here...

01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:25.719
but we're
working double shifts.

01:24:25.753 --> 01:24:30.510
But Dolly can always
take a message.

01:24:30.553 --> 01:24:32.919
OK.

01:24:32.953 --> 01:24:34.895
Thank you.

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.385
What's the matter?

01:24:46.424 --> 01:24:48.148
Nothing.

01:24:52.376 --> 01:24:54.100
I miss Drew.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.236
Call him up.

01:25:01.561 --> 01:25:03.632
Angela went back to her husband.

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:09.650
Gee, Dolly, I'm sorry.

01:25:12.056 --> 01:25:13.462
You OK?

01:25:13.495 --> 01:25:15.350
You could have thought
of that this morning...

01:25:15.383 --> 01:25:17.772
before your nineteenth
nervous breakdown.

01:25:19.767 --> 01:25:23.247
Don't you lay this off on me.

01:25:23.286 --> 01:25:26.156
Anybody else would have
thrown Angela out day one.

01:25:26.199 --> 01:25:28.849
When Drew was here,
you weren't like this.

01:25:28.886 --> 01:25:32.302
You think Angela left
on account of me?

01:25:32.342 --> 01:25:35.308
Let me tell you something, girl.

01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:38.994
Drew left on account
of you and Angela.

01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:41.877
If you believe that,
you're crazier than people say.

01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:44.146
You took about as
good care of Drew...

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:46.418
as you took of your kids.

01:26:03.957 --> 01:26:07.918
I know that you took
good care of your kids.

01:26:20.212 --> 01:26:22.121
You know...

01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:27.368
the only thing everybody
says I'm crazy about...

01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:29.799
is to live with you.

01:26:34.867 --> 01:26:37.256
You mean with a dyke?

01:26:39.347 --> 01:26:41.234
I mean with a person
who thinks she's in love...

01:26:41.266 --> 01:26:46.089
with a person who puts
lipstick on stiffs...

01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:49.033
and smells like formaldehyde.

01:26:49.075 --> 01:26:51.857
She didn't smell
like formaldehyde.

01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:55.207
She did so.

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:58.119
And I'm so tired of her jokes.

01:27:11.505 --> 01:27:14.375
You know, maybe...

01:27:15.346 --> 01:27:17.167
maybe Drew is right.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.905
Maybe we should just quit...

01:27:24.944 --> 01:27:27.312
get out of here.

01:27:27.345 --> 01:27:29.417
Move someplace where it's clean.

01:27:33.104 --> 01:27:34.794
You and me?

01:27:40.784 --> 01:27:43.150
Jesus, Dolly.

01:27:43.183 --> 01:27:44.940
Well...

01:28:22.477 --> 01:28:25.325
Hush-a-bye

01:28:25.358 --> 01:28:27.267
Don't you cry

01:28:29.676 --> 01:28:33.768
Go to sleep, you little baby

01:28:36.141 --> 01:28:39.436
When you wake

01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:43.266
You shall have

01:28:43.309 --> 01:28:49.222
All the pretty little horses

01:29:08.556 --> 01:29:11.654
- I don't want it.
- Eat something, Karen.

01:29:15.084 --> 01:29:16.806
I'm not hungry.

01:29:19.082 --> 01:29:21.984
That's just like Curtis.
When he works late...

01:29:22.027 --> 01:29:24.360
he don't get enough sleep
and loses his appetite.

01:29:24.394 --> 01:29:27.078
I've been blending up
these shakes...

01:29:27.115 --> 01:29:29.252
with bananas
and chocolate syrup...

01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:31.907
and making him drink them
on the way to work.

01:29:31.946 --> 01:29:34.183
Curtis is out working late?

01:29:34.219 --> 01:29:38.691
- Out partying at the Red Dog.
- Come on, Wesley.

01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:42.145
He's been up four nights
in a row flushing out pipes.

01:29:42.185 --> 01:29:44.094
They come up short again.

01:29:44.138 --> 01:29:46.658
They come up short
on plutonium?

01:29:46.697 --> 01:29:48.453
He's telling you
he's working late...

01:29:48.489 --> 01:29:51.140
but he's seeing a hot
little number from Edmond.

01:29:53.032 --> 01:29:54.145
Don't forget the banana...

01:29:54.185 --> 01:29:58.015
and you can put in an egg
if you want to.

01:29:58.057 --> 01:29:59.912
They say they were missing
more than a kilo?

01:30:07.432 --> 01:30:08.675
I'll see you later.

01:30:08.712 --> 01:30:11.810
Why are you writing it down?

01:30:11.848 --> 01:30:14.947
The union is supposed
to keep track of these things.

01:30:14.984 --> 01:30:18.018
Am I right? OK. So?

01:30:21.352 --> 01:30:23.872
You won your election.

01:30:24.904 --> 01:30:28.384
We are still negotiating
a contract here.

01:30:30.247 --> 01:30:32.222
Well...

01:30:32.263 --> 01:30:35.111
Why don't you concentrate
on upping our wages...

01:30:35.143 --> 01:30:37.477
and skip over
what is none of our business?

01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:39.650
This is our business, honey.

01:30:50.342 --> 01:30:52.928
Karen, I like my job!

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:09.149
And I found out
that this 18-year-old kid...

01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:12.091
had been underneath
uncapping the drain...

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:16.192
and a cup of the solution
dumped right down on him.

01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:17.822
Right on his head.

01:31:17.861 --> 01:31:19.388
So they shaved his head...

01:31:19.428 --> 01:31:21.698
and now the stubble
is growing in hot.

01:31:21.733 --> 01:31:24.220
Jesus, that's terrible.

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.951
Are you getting
the stuff together?

01:31:25.989 --> 01:31:31.203
Maintenance people are exposed
to more hot stuff than anybody.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:35.229
Look, Karen, the X-rays
are really important.

01:31:35.268 --> 01:31:36.991
We're going into
the contract negotiations...

01:31:37.028 --> 01:31:38.587
and we want to get the guy
from the "Times" down there...

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.831
in mid-November.
That's three weeks.

01:31:40.868 --> 01:31:44.664
I know, I know.
I'm getting the stuff.

01:31:44.707 --> 01:31:48.056
It's just not that easy.

01:32:36.578 --> 01:32:38.038
Morgan!

01:32:40.224 --> 01:32:44.152
- You scared me.
- Meant to.

01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:46.167
I'm doing something good.

01:32:46.208 --> 01:32:47.932
I know what you're doing...

01:32:47.968 --> 01:32:50.041
and you're the wrong person
to be doing it.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.877
And it's dangerous.
That's all I'm saying.

01:33:53.565 --> 01:33:55.420
Thank you, Curtis.
It's good to know.

01:33:56.988 --> 01:33:59.029
Gilda says Karen
is going to get...

01:33:59.069 --> 01:34:00.759
one of those
Sherlock Holmes hats.

01:34:00.797 --> 01:34:04.538
Then she'll find everything
that's missing in the plant.

01:34:12.252 --> 01:34:15.415
Winston, seen my clipboard?

01:34:25.979 --> 01:34:27.124
Why don't you speak
to the union...

01:34:27.163 --> 01:34:28.724
about how you're late
for work all the time?

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.137
Late from your break.

01:34:30.171 --> 01:34:31.480
Supposed to be in here
ten minutes ago...

01:34:31.516 --> 01:34:33.424
instead of wherever you were.

01:34:35.867 --> 01:34:38.200
Tell them that next time
you go to Washington.

01:35:05.017 --> 01:35:07.864
Stopped in to say hi to y'all.

01:35:07.897 --> 01:35:11.212
God, I don't know
hardly any of you people.

01:35:16.473 --> 01:35:18.895
Gilda, you have any time?

01:35:18.937 --> 01:35:22.864
Maybe I could talk to you
on your break?

01:35:22.904 --> 01:35:24.813
I can't, Karen.

01:35:27.129 --> 01:35:30.227
Just for a couple minutes?

01:35:31.543 --> 01:35:33.845
Maybe next week.

01:35:37.368 --> 01:35:38.993
You monitoring yourself, Karen?

01:35:39.031 --> 01:35:40.209
Yes, Georgie!

01:35:40.247 --> 01:35:41.774
I hope you write it down...

01:35:41.815 --> 01:35:44.303
in your little notebook
every time you don't!

01:35:44.343 --> 01:35:47.190
Along with the stuff
about the rest of us!

01:35:48.312 --> 01:35:52.141
Oh, no! No! Damn it!

01:36:04.822 --> 01:36:07.092
They haven't found
a hole in the glove...

01:36:07.127 --> 01:36:08.587
but they're still checking.

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:11.498
It's a very slight
external contamination.

01:36:11.541 --> 01:36:13.266
An acceptable level.

01:36:13.302 --> 01:36:16.618
And you're clean now.

01:36:16.661 --> 01:36:18.603
Been bringing your samples in?

01:36:18.645 --> 01:36:20.172
Every week.

01:36:20.213 --> 01:36:22.285
Start bringing them in
on a daily basis.

01:36:22.324 --> 01:36:26.154
You can pick up your kits
on the way out of the plant.

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:31.697
Boy, I'll be happy the day
I don't have to pee in a jar.

01:37:22.483 --> 01:37:24.107
Are you all right?

01:37:26.675 --> 01:37:29.129
Yeah. I'm all right.

01:37:29.169 --> 01:37:31.504
Would you call somebody for me?

01:37:31.537 --> 01:37:33.228
Yeah, sure.

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:41.740
Lookit! Drew!
My God, you're back!

01:38:41.774 --> 01:38:44.457
I missed you so much!
Look at your little face!

01:38:44.494 --> 01:38:46.403
Dolly, stop!

01:38:46.446 --> 01:38:48.617
Jesus, I'm late.

01:38:48.653 --> 01:38:51.337
Look at your little body!

01:38:54.382 --> 01:38:56.171
Is she OK?

01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:59.371
Shit!

01:39:04.717 --> 01:39:07.913
I spilled my urine sample.

01:39:12.205 --> 01:39:15.271
Her and that union monkey
got nothing going anymore.

01:39:15.309 --> 01:39:18.276
It's strictly business.
Are you moving back in?

01:39:18.316 --> 01:39:20.226
I got a place of my own, Dolly.

01:39:20.268 --> 01:39:22.570
You two can come stay with me
anytime you want.

01:39:27.021 --> 01:39:28.875
Bologna and cheese.

01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.620
Jesus!

01:39:43.787 --> 01:39:45.643
If you're back,
I'm really glad you're back.

01:40:26.185 --> 01:40:27.876
Good morning.

01:40:27.914 --> 01:40:29.800
Hi, Karen. How you doing?

01:40:29.833 --> 01:40:31.840
I'm in the pink.

01:40:37.928 --> 01:40:39.816
Oh, God!

01:40:45.864 --> 01:40:47.108
Don't!

01:40:52.104 --> 01:40:55.649
No! Stop it!

01:40:55.687 --> 01:40:57.957
Stop it! Stop it!

01:41:01.448 --> 01:41:02.657
Earl, what's going on?

01:41:02.694 --> 01:41:03.808
Dolly,
this won't take long...

01:41:03.847 --> 01:41:05.276
but I don't want you
getting in our way.

01:41:05.319 --> 01:41:09.028
Who the hell are these people?

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:13.317
This is my house!
Tell me what's going...

01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:05.184
One package of S.O.S.

01:42:05.221 --> 01:42:07.522
One box of S.O.S.

01:42:07.556 --> 01:42:09.728
One bottle of Spray 'n Wipe.

01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:11.485
One bottle of Spray 'n Wipe.

01:42:11.524 --> 01:42:15.036
One pack of Rice-a-roni.

01:42:15.074 --> 01:42:17.312
One package Rice-a-roni.

01:42:17.348 --> 01:42:20.763
Three framed photographs.

01:42:20.803 --> 01:42:24.316
Don't take those!

01:42:24.355 --> 01:42:27.202
These are my kids' pictures.

01:42:27.235 --> 01:42:30.082
Earl, don't let them take
my babies' pictures.

01:42:30.115 --> 01:42:32.962
If you're going to watch,
you have to stand back now.

01:42:32.995 --> 01:42:35.362
Mr. Hurley,
they're taking everything.

01:42:35.395 --> 01:42:37.565
Listen to me.

01:42:37.602 --> 01:42:40.385
We're getting readings from
the sink, the toilet seat...

01:42:40.418 --> 01:42:41.793
from the make-up you touched...

01:42:41.826 --> 01:42:43.801
from the bologna and cheese
in the refrigerator...

01:42:43.842 --> 01:42:45.500
from your samples...

01:42:45.538 --> 01:42:47.775
and we're getting next to
nothing on Drew and Dolly...

01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:49.020
and your car
is absolutely clean.

01:42:49.058 --> 01:42:52.123
How do you explain that?

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.715
- I don't know.
- Think about it, Karen.

01:42:54.754 --> 01:42:56.160
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

01:42:56.193 --> 01:42:58.266
- I have to go with him.
- No!

01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.931
I'll be OK.
I have it under control.

01:42:59.969 --> 01:43:02.390
- Don't go anywhere with him.
- It's all right.

01:43:02.432 --> 01:43:05.368
I'm coming!
Keep your goddamn hands off!

01:43:05.409 --> 01:43:06.903
It's all right.

01:43:11.009 --> 01:43:12.831
Come on, Karen. Concentrate.

01:43:12.865 --> 01:43:15.036
How did that plutonium
get in my house?

01:43:15.072 --> 01:43:16.927
Did you put it there?

01:43:16.961 --> 01:43:20.953
Did I what? Are you crazy?

01:43:20.992 --> 01:43:22.781
You think I put...

01:43:22.817 --> 01:43:25.598
You think
I'd contaminate myself?

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:28.730
I think you'd do anything
to hurt this company.

01:43:31.775 --> 01:43:33.717
- Then I spilled it.
- What?

01:43:33.759 --> 01:43:35.963
I spilled
my urine sample container.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.032
Somebody must have put
plutonium in my container.

01:43:39.071 --> 01:43:41.887
And then I spilled it
on my bathroom floor.

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:46.326
I cleaned it all up
and my hands must have got hot.

01:43:46.367 --> 01:43:48.735
And then what did I touch?

01:43:48.767 --> 01:43:50.654
OK, I touched my sink...

01:43:50.686 --> 01:43:54.003
I touched my make-up...

01:43:54.047 --> 01:43:57.843
and I forget what stuff
in the refrigerator.

01:43:57.886 --> 01:44:01.683
That's it. See?

01:44:01.726 --> 01:44:03.614
Somebody spiked
my urine sample container.

01:44:03.647 --> 01:44:05.435
- Who?
- Boy!

01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:08.055
How do I know who?
Anybody could have done it.

01:44:08.094 --> 01:44:11.389
You leave it sitting there by
the punch-in at the plant!

01:44:11.422 --> 01:44:15.676
Anybody could've dropped
a little plutonium in there.

01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:18.906
There's a lot of people
at the plant hate me.

01:44:18.941 --> 01:44:21.843
The whole house is hot.
How did it get hot?

01:44:21.886 --> 01:44:23.773
I spilled it!
I told you, man!

01:44:23.806 --> 01:44:25.213
That doesn't explain
the readings...

01:44:25.245 --> 01:44:27.317
we're getting
on your nasal smear.

01:44:27.356 --> 01:44:29.528
45,000 DPM.

01:44:32.061 --> 01:44:33.467
What?

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.410
45,000 DPM.

01:44:36.381 --> 01:44:37.941
Oh, my Jesus.

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:44.180
I'm internally contaminated.
That's what you mean.

01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.464
We don't know what it means.

01:44:45.499 --> 01:44:47.987
- That's what you mean!
- Karen, calm down.

01:44:52.699 --> 01:44:54.740
Karen, listen.

01:44:54.781 --> 01:44:56.918
Get out of my way!

01:45:01.147 --> 01:45:05.172
Oh, Jesus!
Where am I going to go now?

01:45:05.211 --> 01:45:07.545
I don't have anyplace to go now.

01:45:07.579 --> 01:45:10.840
We're getting a room for Dolly.
We want to help you.

01:45:10.874 --> 01:45:12.817
We can help you
with a place to stay.

01:45:12.859 --> 01:45:14.452
We can help you with money.

01:45:26.234 --> 01:45:30.163
But first I have
to sign something, right?

01:45:30.202 --> 01:45:34.740
You want me to sign a statement
saying I did all this.

01:45:34.778 --> 01:45:37.745
Just in your own words
what happened.

01:45:44.153 --> 01:45:45.908
OK.

01:45:53.591 --> 01:45:56.178
In my own words?

01:45:58.232 --> 01:46:00.142
I'm contaminated.

01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:03.789
I'm dying.

01:48:48.047 --> 01:48:50.121
What are you doing here?

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.284
I'm just looking around,
like you.

01:49:58.764 --> 01:50:00.706
You're here.

01:50:00.748 --> 01:50:03.978
Jesus Christ.
I didn't know where you were.

01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:07.938
What the hell happened?

01:50:13.003 --> 01:50:14.825
They're killing me.

01:50:14.859 --> 01:50:16.168
They're trying to kill me.

01:50:16.204 --> 01:50:19.072
They want me
to stop what I'm doing.

01:50:19.114 --> 01:50:22.660
They contaminated me,
you know that?

01:50:22.699 --> 01:50:25.219
I'm internally contaminated now.

01:50:26.986 --> 01:50:29.092
Now, you listen to me.

01:50:29.131 --> 01:50:32.000
We're going to go
to Los Alamos on Thursday...

01:50:32.042 --> 01:50:33.929
and we'll get a full body count
from some doctors...

01:50:33.962 --> 01:50:35.620
who know what they're doing.
All three of us.

01:50:35.659 --> 01:50:39.237
Oh, God! I'm so scared now.

01:51:00.809 --> 01:51:03.526
It says here that
there's plutonium missing...

01:51:03.561 --> 01:51:06.855
from just about every
nuclear plant in this country.

01:51:06.888 --> 01:51:10.019
- Who's got it?
- Any asshole that wants it.

01:51:10.057 --> 01:51:12.129
Man.

01:51:12.169 --> 01:51:16.063
That's the guy, Drew.

01:51:16.105 --> 01:51:17.827
The guy
Paul is bringing to see me.

01:51:17.864 --> 01:51:19.293
Who?

01:51:19.336 --> 01:51:21.638
The guy that wrote it,
from the "New York Times."

01:51:21.672 --> 01:51:23.265
If you're going to be
in the newspaper...

01:51:23.305 --> 01:51:25.508
I want to be in there, too.

01:51:32.391 --> 01:51:35.740
Dolly, did you...

01:51:35.783 --> 01:51:40.039
Did you tell the company
about the "New York Times"?

01:51:40.071 --> 01:51:42.144
No. I don't think
I remembered that part.

01:51:49.542 --> 01:51:51.998
Did you tell them
about the X-rays?

01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:58.016
- Dolly?
- No.

01:51:58.054 --> 01:52:00.094
Are you sure?

01:52:00.135 --> 01:52:03.483
Karen, they know
everything about us.

01:52:12.037 --> 01:52:14.623
They don't know
about the X-rays, do they?

01:52:51.651 --> 01:52:54.369
OK. That's it.

01:53:21.601 --> 01:53:25.016
All right, Mr. Stephens
and Miss Pelliker...

01:53:25.058 --> 01:53:29.019
you both check out well below
permissible body limits.

01:53:29.058 --> 01:53:31.610
You were exposed to
Miss Silkwood and the house...

01:53:31.649 --> 01:53:35.391
but you show minimum
detectable activity now.

01:53:37.665 --> 01:53:39.901
Miss Silkwood.

01:53:43.553 --> 01:53:47.579
We have detected
americium in both lungs...

01:53:47.617 --> 01:53:49.340
and both sides of your chest.

01:53:49.376 --> 01:53:52.637
Americium is produced
when plutonium disintegrates.

01:53:52.672 --> 01:53:55.192
And extrapolating from
your americium level...

01:53:55.233 --> 01:53:58.014
we estimate you have
an internal contamination...

01:53:58.048 --> 01:54:01.364
of six nanocuries of plutonium.

01:54:01.407 --> 01:54:03.611
The maximum permissible
body burden...

01:54:03.648 --> 01:54:07.096
for occupational exposure
is 40 nanocuries.

01:54:07.136 --> 01:54:10.332
As you can see,
you are well under that level.

01:54:10.367 --> 01:54:15.123
- I'm under it.
- As well as we can determine.

01:54:15.166 --> 01:54:18.266
These are very sophisticated
instruments...

01:54:18.304 --> 01:54:20.888
but their accuracy may be off...

01:54:20.927 --> 01:54:24.058
by plus or minus 300%
at this level.

01:54:25.567 --> 01:54:27.508
Plus or minus 300%?

01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:29.045
That's correct.

01:54:29.086 --> 01:54:31.290
Then what you're saying is...

01:54:31.326 --> 01:54:33.333
that the amount
of plutonium inside me...

01:54:33.374 --> 01:54:36.474
could be three times less
than you even think?

01:54:36.511 --> 01:54:39.161
Or three times greater.

01:54:40.925 --> 01:54:45.595
But even that would be under
the maximum body burden.

01:54:57.917 --> 01:55:01.463
I think you should come on
down to Oklahoma City...

01:55:01.501 --> 01:55:03.922
and bring that reporter
from the "New York Times."

01:55:03.964 --> 01:55:06.899
Are you ready to see him?

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:08.347
I'm ready.

01:55:08.381 --> 01:55:10.322
You got the documents?

01:55:12.061 --> 01:55:13.434
Come on down.

01:55:17.851 --> 01:55:22.423
Man, I love it here.
I love this country.

01:55:22.459 --> 01:55:24.980
Wouldn't you like
to stay here forever?

01:55:27.963 --> 01:55:30.451
Doctors are all goddamn liars.

01:55:33.563 --> 01:55:36.694
Land's cheap there.

01:55:36.732 --> 01:55:39.098
I read about this.

01:55:39.130 --> 01:55:41.170
You can build yourself
a pueblo house.

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:45.618
Make it out of adobe brick,
like the Indians.

01:55:45.659 --> 01:55:50.579
Mud, straw...
comes right out of the ground.

01:55:50.618 --> 01:55:53.520
Got to build a well,
but that's not too bad.

01:55:53.561 --> 01:55:56.017
You get a bunch of guys
to do you a favor.

01:55:56.058 --> 01:55:57.367
You do them a favor.

01:55:57.401 --> 01:55:59.889
It's all barter system
out there.

01:55:59.929 --> 01:56:01.718
You can make the rooms
any shape.

01:56:01.753 --> 01:56:03.160
You can make 'em round.

01:56:03.194 --> 01:56:04.982
It's not a right-angle
kind of life.

01:56:05.017 --> 01:56:06.392
Yeah.

01:56:08.313 --> 01:56:10.702
Have room for your kids.

01:56:13.273 --> 01:56:14.702
Yeah.

01:56:17.912 --> 01:56:20.051
Hell, we could have
kids of our own.

01:56:22.968 --> 01:56:24.878
We love each other.

01:56:31.352 --> 01:56:33.108
Why not?

01:56:38.232 --> 01:56:40.435
They wouldn't...

01:56:40.471 --> 01:56:42.839
They wouldn't come out right.

01:56:42.872 --> 01:56:45.238
Hell, I didn't come out right.

01:56:45.271 --> 01:56:47.181
You came out OK.

01:56:59.606 --> 01:57:01.516
What is it?

01:57:02.967 --> 01:57:04.876
Come on.

01:57:05.847 --> 01:57:09.360
Come on. I don't care.

01:57:10.806 --> 01:57:12.235
I know.

01:57:15.094 --> 01:57:16.753
You aren't going
to contaminate me...

01:57:16.789 --> 01:57:19.474
any more than
I've already been.

01:57:38.197 --> 01:57:40.946
I'm sorry.
I forgot to turn off the alarm.

01:57:43.765 --> 01:57:46.065
I thought you weren't going in.

01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:49.678
Well... I have to.

01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:53.747
Call in sick.

01:57:53.779 --> 01:57:55.668
No, I really do.

01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:58.733
I really mean
you ought to call in sick.

01:57:58.771 --> 01:58:00.876
Think they'll let you work?

01:58:00.915 --> 01:58:02.378
There's something I got to get.

01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:05.266
At the plant?
Are you wearing my shirt?

01:58:05.299 --> 01:58:06.860
- Huh?
- My shirt!

01:58:06.899 --> 01:58:10.248
You don't have to get up now.

01:58:10.291 --> 01:58:13.422
Sweetheart, don't go try get
anything out of the plant.

01:58:13.459 --> 01:58:15.183
If I get hung up
at the union meeting...

01:58:15.219 --> 01:58:16.910
will you pick up
Paul Stone and the guy...

01:58:16.946 --> 01:58:18.539
from the "New York Times"
at the airport?

01:58:18.579 --> 01:58:20.139
Fuck no.

01:58:20.179 --> 01:58:21.586
Come on, darling.

01:58:21.619 --> 01:58:23.025
I don't know how late
this meeting will go tonight.

01:58:23.059 --> 01:58:24.368
I don't want you doing that.

01:58:24.402 --> 01:58:27.664
Well... I'm doing it.

01:58:27.699 --> 01:58:30.065
You don't owe
the union anything.

01:58:30.097 --> 01:58:31.920
Let's not fight.

01:58:31.954 --> 01:58:34.441
You don't owe
the "New York Times" anything.

01:58:34.481 --> 01:58:37.230
Let's not have a fight now.

01:58:45.457 --> 01:58:47.367
We always can have a fight later.

01:59:15.376 --> 01:59:21.159
Amazing grace

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:27.081
How sweet the sound

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:31.788
That saved a wretch...

01:59:31.822 --> 01:59:35.619
- Give me your notes.
- OK.

01:59:35.662 --> 01:59:37.637
Listen, you sure you're OK?

01:59:37.679 --> 01:59:38.956
I'm OK.

01:59:38.991 --> 01:59:40.300
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

01:59:40.335 --> 01:59:43.498
Once was lost

01:59:43.534 --> 01:59:49.099
But now I'm found

01:59:49.134 --> 01:59:51.949
Was blind

01:59:51.982 --> 01:59:59.434
But now I see

02:00:00.941 --> 02:00:06.309
'Twas grace that taught

02:00:06.349 --> 02:00:11.499
My heart to fear

02:00:11.533 --> 02:00:21.321
And grace my fears released

02:00:21.357 --> 02:00:31.721
How precious
did that grace appear

02:00:31.756 --> 02:00:41.826
The hour I first believed

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:51.425
Through many dangers,
toils, and snares

02:00:51.467 --> 02:01:01.669
We have already come

02:01:01.706 --> 02:01:12.071
'Twas grace that brought us
safe thus far

02:01:12.107 --> 02:01:21.118
And grace will lead us home

02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:31.014
When we've been there
ten thousand years

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:41.022
Bright-shining as the sun

02:01:41.064 --> 02:01:46.399
We've no less days

02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:51.622
To sing God's praise

02:01:51.656 --> 02:02:01.508
As when we first begun

02:02:01.543 --> 02:02:06.300
Amazing grace

02:02:06.343 --> 02:02:11.710
How sweet the sound

02:02:11.751 --> 02:02:21.571
That saved a wretch like me

02:02:21.606 --> 02:02:26.210
I once was lost

02:02:26.245 --> 02:02:31.331
But now I'm found

02:02:31.366 --> 02:02:38.043
Was bound, but now I'm free
