Craig! You guys!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
You're okay!

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
I realized that I like building stuff.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
But it's no fun without you guys.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I'm sorry, too.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't think you waste your time

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
building cool things like this...

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
weapon of mass destruction!

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah! You didn't tell us you were building a giant robot!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Aah!

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Gimme one good reason

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I shouldn't turn you into papier-mâché!

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Don't you see, I did this all for you!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
You could have been my cardboard queen!

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Get outta here, Carter, before I paper cut you.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I'll be back, you'll see!

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
One rainstorm, and you'll wish

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
you had my brains and my duct tape...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
and my heart.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, glad we're still friends.
