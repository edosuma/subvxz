WEBVTT

00:02.824 --> 00:04.074
Schenectady?!

00:05.182 --> 00:07.083
You're in Schenectady?!

00:07.150 --> 00:12.154
After all your naggy lectures about how
I need to stop micro-managing ISIS?!

00:12.222 --> 00:14.090
You do!
And this is... macro-managing!

00:14.157 --> 00:16.926
C'mon, some things I gotta do myself!

00:16.994 --> 00:18.728
Mr. Archer's on line two.

00:18.796 --> 00:19.629
I'm on the phone!

00:19.697 --> 00:21.965
Yeah, duh, line two.

00:22.032 --> 00:23.113
Wh-?
- Mother?!

00:23.133 --> 00:24.333
Sterling --
Don't talk, just listen!

00:24.401 --> 00:27.003
My cover's blown and I
need an extraction!

00:27.071 --> 00:30.272
Oh my -- wait,
extraction from where?

00:30.340 --> 00:34.176
Montreal, long story, but my money
and passport were confiscated, so --

00:34.244 --> 00:36.980
So where in Montreal exactly?

00:37.047 --> 00:43.152
Uh... Like, the GPS coordinates, or --
Bienvenue au Casino de Montreal.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.989
Confiscated by whom?
A croupier?

00:46.056 --> 00:47.890
- No!
- Or a herd of Quebecker whores?!

00:47.958 --> 00:50.159
- I wouldn't say herd...
- Well, after you get some

00:50.227 --> 00:54.196
free penicillin, compliments of the
Socialist Republic of Canada --

00:54.264 --> 00:54.831
Wait, really?

00:54.898 --> 00:56.633
-- you can extract
yourself, mister!

00:56.700 --> 00:59.301
- Mother I don't have a passpor --
-- I mean don't

00:59.369 --> 01:01.871
get me wrong, I respect that,
but comparing ISIS to six

01:01.939 --> 01:06.408
Cadillac dealerships is like comparing
apples to... six Cadillac --

01:06.476 --> 01:07.677
- Ron!
- What?!

01:07.745 --> 01:10.105
Sterling is stranded at
the Montreal Casino with his

01:10.114 --> 01:14.083
pockets turned out and -- and
this is just speculation --

01:14.151 --> 01:16.819
some new drug-resistant form of V.D.

01:16.887 --> 01:20.523
- Reeally...
- And you're in Schenectady. Again!

01:20.590 --> 01:21.958
I'll be home tonight!

01:22.026 --> 01:22.792
Oh, I know!

01:22.860 --> 01:23.926
Because what's tonight?!

01:23.994 --> 01:27.363
Uh, Tuesday? Night?

01:27.430 --> 01:28.297
Box seats!

01:28.365 --> 01:30.400
For the opening of "Carmen" at the Met!

01:30.467 --> 01:32.147
Babe, c'mon, I
promise, I'll be there!

01:32.169 --> 01:35.705
Well if you're not, you can
just not bother coming home at all!

01:35.773 --> 01:39.441
I --
Trouble on the old hooomfront?

01:39.509 --> 01:41.177
Oh for the -- eavesdrop much?!

01:41.244 --> 01:43.245
Scream into a speakerphone much?

01:43.313 --> 01:44.547
- Pam...?
- What?!

01:44.614 --> 01:47.283
You want us to wear earplugs every
time you're on the damn pho --

01:47.350 --> 01:49.952
Ooh, or helmets!

01:50.020 --> 01:52.922
It is just idiots,
all the way down.

01:52.990 --> 01:56.959
And his money, I get it, that's all
craps and whores, but his passport?

01:57.027 --> 01:59.996
How the hell did he lose his passport?

02:00.064 --> 02:04.400
Bekuz, shuddup, bekuz I dunneebit...
Bekuz I dunnever go homerika,

02:04.467 --> 02:08.104
bekuz, shuddup, bekuz je -- hic!

02:08.172 --> 02:08.937
Je tam!

02:09.006 --> 02:12.909
- Tabernac...
- It's my third biggest fear.

02:12.976 --> 02:15.845
He brings home a whore and
says "We're married!"

02:15.913 --> 02:20.349
Oh, and the whore has bangs.

02:20.417 --> 02:23.886
Ugh, thank God I don't have to worry
about anything like that with Ron.

02:23.954 --> 02:27.123
"Hi, I'm Ron Cadillac, aka Mr. Boring."

02:27.191 --> 02:32.294
- Jesus God, what am I doing with...
- Ron Cadillac!

02:32.362 --> 02:34.296
They don't make the rules!

02:34.364 --> 02:35.464
You do!

02:35.532 --> 02:38.935
Well obviously they do make the
rules, that's why it's come to this.

02:39.002 --> 02:41.938
Which is why Ron Cadillac is opting out!

02:42.005 --> 02:47.476
And also why Ron Cadillac is gonna
swing by Montreal on his way home.

02:47.544 --> 02:51.313
Because Ron Cadillac is frickin epic.

03:32.470 --> 03:35.506
Carol, hey, shut up, I need you
to go down to Western Union and wire me

03:35.573 --> 03:37.107
a thousand dollars.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.309
Wow.

03:38.376 --> 03:39.242
Yeah.

03:39.311 --> 03:40.411
No.

03:40.478 --> 03:41.211
Yes!

03:41.279 --> 03:42.313
No!

03:42.380 --> 03:44.515
Oh for -- then
just lemme talk to Pam!

03:44.582 --> 03:47.050
Absolutely not.
Huh?

03:47.118 --> 03:50.554
Because pick any one of an
infinite number of reasons!

03:50.622 --> 03:54.157
- Yeah, okay, hang on...
- Mmmmyeah, no, I would,

03:54.225 --> 03:59.763
but I can't really leave the lab at the moment...
But I can transfer you...

03:59.831 --> 04:04.435
No, I seriously
thought you were joking.

04:04.502 --> 04:10.006
- Yeah, hang on...

04:10.074 --> 04:11.274
Okay.

04:11.343 --> 04:12.042
Okay!

04:12.109 --> 04:13.344
Lemme talk to Lana!

04:13.411 --> 04:14.345
Tabernac!

04:14.412 --> 04:15.713
You know there is a line?!

04:15.780 --> 04:17.279
There's gonna
be a line at your wake!

04:17.349 --> 04:18.982
So shut your poutine hole,

04:19.050 --> 04:19.583
and lemme --

04:19.651 --> 04:21.485
Lana?! Lana listen, I --

04:21.553 --> 04:21.985
Noop.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.253
-- need you to --
Noop.

04:23.321 --> 04:23.987
Stop saying noop!

04:24.055 --> 04:25.021
Noop, Archer.

04:25.089 --> 04:25.589
Noop.

04:25.657 --> 04:30.361
And it's gonna sound like I'm
hanging up but --

04:30.428 --> 04:32.262
Why do you
casser le telephone?!

04:32.330 --> 04:35.198
Because I'm out
of people to call!

04:35.266 --> 04:38.034
Even Woodhouse wouldn't help me...
What do you mean, no?!

04:38.102 --> 04:39.703
I basically own you!

04:39.771 --> 04:41.438
And I basically own him.

04:41.506 --> 04:43.974
Jesus, this is actually
almost depressing.

04:44.642 --> 04:45.776
Need a ride, champ?

04:45.844 --> 04:48.912
Although not as depressing as
Ron what the hell are you doing here?!

04:48.980 --> 04:50.481
Giving you a ride home.

04:50.548 --> 04:51.147
C'mon, hop in!

04:51.215 --> 04:52.015
Did Mother send you?

04:52.083 --> 04:57.053
Uh, not exactly, I uh, just thought
it'd give us a chance to uh, bond.

04:57.121 --> 05:01.057
Yeah, don't take this the wrong way,
Ron, but I'd rather bond with a C.H.U.D.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.693
Il est la!
Il est la!

05:02.761 --> 05:06.430
But C.H.U.D.'s live
in New York so let's go!

05:06.498 --> 05:08.932
What the hell is a chud?!

05:09.000 --> 05:12.002
They were people, but then
they got splashed with toxic waste.

05:12.069 --> 05:14.405
- Aw, that's a load of crap...
- It's a movie!

05:14.472 --> 05:18.542
But those baby alligators people
flush down there, now that's --

05:18.610 --> 05:21.111
Ron! C'mon, seriously,
at some point I'm gonna have to

05:21.178 --> 05:23.714
take a shit, so --
So why didn't you go before we left?

05:23.782 --> 05:24.448
Not now!

05:24.516 --> 05:25.549
In the future!

05:25.617 --> 05:28.351
And I won't be able to if I'm
thinking about giant alligators

05:28.420 --> 05:30.954
rampaging up into my toilet!

05:31.022 --> 05:34.090
- Talk about tearing you a new one...
- For the love of Christ,

05:34.158 --> 05:35.492
man! Stop!

05:37.261 --> 05:41.197
I meant, stop talking, about
assripping sewer-gators.

05:41.265 --> 05:42.198
Yeah, I know.

05:42.266 --> 05:43.434
So?!

05:43.501 --> 05:45.135
He asked, incredulously!

05:45.202 --> 05:46.904
You said you didn't have a passport.

05:46.971 --> 05:47.370
So?!

05:47.439 --> 05:49.907
He asked, equally incredulously!

05:49.974 --> 05:51.007
So that.

05:51.075 --> 05:53.944
Oh. So...?

05:54.011 --> 05:57.280
And that's not sarcastic incredulity,
I honestly wanna hear your

05:57.348 --> 06:00.183
thoughts on getting me across.

06:00.251 --> 06:00.651
Why not?!

06:00.718 --> 06:02.786
Because what if
they check the trunk?!

06:02.854 --> 06:03.687
Why would they?

06:03.755 --> 06:05.689
Because that's exactly their job!

06:05.757 --> 06:07.390
Yeah, on the Mexican border!

06:07.459 --> 06:11.361
Who the hell's gonna
sneak in from Canada?!

06:11.429 --> 06:12.162
Arctic wolves?

06:12.229 --> 06:15.298
And even if you had a passport,
what if they checked you for a gun?

06:15.366 --> 06:17.246
I --
You do have a gun, don't you?

06:17.301 --> 06:20.303
Yeah, I --
Yeah, I, so uh, maybe keep it handy.

06:20.371 --> 06:20.891
What?

06:20.905 --> 06:24.475
Wait, why would I -- Ron?

06:24.542 --> 06:27.578
Ron. Ron.

06:27.645 --> 06:29.480
Roooooooooooooooooooon!

06:29.547 --> 06:30.246
What?!

06:30.314 --> 06:32.015
Oh.

06:32.083 --> 06:35.018
Never mind, I got it.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.262
Ron! Let me outta
the goddamn trunk!

06:43.329 --> 06:45.730
We passed the border an hour ago!

06:45.798 --> 06:47.602
Actually more like three hours.

06:47.722 --> 06:50.281
I -- well
apparently I took a nap!

06:51.938 --> 06:53.538
Probably all this carbon dioxide.

06:53.606 --> 06:56.825
It's actually monoxide--
Whichever!

06:56.945 --> 06:58.944
Of carbon's many oxides!

06:59.012 --> 07:02.621
Just lemme out! I gotta bitch of a
headache and a bladder full of bourbon!

07:02.680 --> 07:03.780
Just hang on!

07:03.847 --> 07:06.749
They always hit me between
Schenectady and Albany.

07:06.817 --> 07:07.738
Who hits you?!

07:07.785 --> 07:11.555
Uh... Those guys.

07:11.622 --> 07:12.556
What the shit!

07:12.623 --> 07:13.356
Ron!

07:13.424 --> 07:14.458
Yeah, so listen!

07:14.525 --> 07:18.361
Remember when I said maybe
keep your gun handy?!

07:18.429 --> 07:19.162
Yeah, vaguely!

07:19.230 --> 07:23.666
Well the thing is --
What's the thing, Ron?!

07:23.734 --> 07:24.701
Oh.

07:24.768 --> 07:26.503
Never mind!

07:29.540 --> 07:31.608
Goddammit Ron, keep it straight!

07:36.280 --> 07:38.415
Ha ha! Wooooooo!

07:38.483 --> 07:40.850
Did you whoa whoa whoa Ron, compensate!

07:40.918 --> 07:41.951
I am compensating!

07:42.019 --> 07:45.054
No no no no no,
look out, you're --

07:52.396 --> 07:54.664
Overcompensating.

07:54.732 --> 07:56.633
Is what I was gonna say.

07:56.700 --> 08:02.172
Right before I was thrown clear of the
vehicle, almost exactly one hundred

08:02.240 --> 08:02.905
linear feet.

08:02.973 --> 08:07.377
Gimme a break, huh,
that wasn't my fault!

08:07.445 --> 08:10.813
Yeah no, I mean obviously this
was all due to the butterfly effect.

08:10.881 --> 08:14.551
- The what -- - Butterfly effect,
ya know, a butterfly in Africa

08:14.619 --> 08:17.654
lands on a giraffe's nose, the
giraffe sneezes, that spooks

08:17.721 --> 08:20.524
a gazelle, the gazelle bonks
into a rhinoceros, and the

08:20.591 --> 08:23.460
rhinoceros blindly stampedes
into a phone booth,

08:23.528 --> 08:29.166
calls New York somehow and says "Hey go
kill this idiot Ron for a suitcase!"

08:29.233 --> 08:32.802
Because the rhinoceros speaks English!

08:32.870 --> 08:37.073
What's in the suitcase, Ron?

08:37.140 --> 08:39.509
Why is that in the suitcase, Ron?!

08:39.577 --> 08:41.010
What, I should use a plastic bag?

08:41.078 --> 08:43.413
Or this new thing
called the bank?!

08:43.481 --> 08:46.916
Well, it's not exactly...
Clean, money.

08:46.984 --> 08:47.917
No, shit.

08:47.985 --> 08:53.156
No, I'm serious... Name one, just
one single favor, that Archer ever did

08:53.224 --> 08:53.756
for any of you.

08:55.726 --> 08:56.159
Oh!

08:56.227 --> 08:58.061
Oh my God, chlamydia.

08:58.128 --> 09:00.497
Which put me over my deductible,
so the rest of that year all my

09:00.565 --> 09:02.999
doctor visits were totally free, score!

09:03.067 --> 09:04.267
- Wow.
- Right?

09:04.335 --> 09:06.169
How much did you
go to the damn doctor?

09:06.237 --> 09:09.239
I dunno, like, a lot...
I kept getting chlamydia.

09:09.307 --> 09:10.006
Oww!

09:10.074 --> 09:11.908
Get! Off! Chlamydiot!

09:11.975 --> 09:14.811
Oh, I get it...
because of the chlamydia.

09:14.878 --> 09:16.112
Oh, and I'm an idiot.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.348
Because of course
you keep getting robbed!

09:18.416 --> 09:20.883
Why're you driving around with a
suitcase full of dirty money?

09:20.951 --> 09:24.421
- It's kind of a long story...
- Well we've got all day!

09:24.488 --> 09:28.692
Nobody's gonna pick us up, we look like...
The Ballad of the Flim-Flam Man.

09:28.759 --> 09:29.326
The what?

09:29.393 --> 09:30.427
Guy Owen?

09:30.494 --> 09:31.528
Jesus, Ron, read a book.

09:31.596 --> 09:34.731
Maybe between biannual
suitcase robberies.

09:34.798 --> 09:36.766
I don't know who
keeps tipping 'em off.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.868
And anyway, you mean semiannual.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.036
They're the same thing!

09:40.104 --> 09:44.441
No, biannual means every two years --
That's biennial!

09:44.508 --> 09:48.211
Bi-, or semi-annual,
means every six months!

09:48.279 --> 09:48.878
Oh.

09:48.946 --> 09:51.581
Then yeah, biannually.

09:51.649 --> 09:53.015
Or semi.

09:53.083 --> 09:57.721
- Speaking of...
- Manhattan, yes, thank you,

09:57.788 --> 09:59.589
and you're sure you can
get us there by seven?

09:59.624 --> 10:00.890
Oh yeah. Just
hop in the back there.

10:00.958 --> 10:03.360
What like, the back back?

10:03.427 --> 10:05.629
Yeah, sorry, you'all
can't ride in the cab.

10:05.696 --> 10:10.367
Insurance bullshit, compliments of
them democratic queers in congress.

10:10.434 --> 10:13.270
Or whomever.

10:13.337 --> 10:15.772
Okay, things are looking up!

10:15.839 --> 10:17.674
No no, hey, c'mon, don't do that!

10:17.742 --> 10:18.775
You're gonna get him in trouble!

10:18.842 --> 10:22.211
Ron, nobody's
gonna miss one beer.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.713
Or the eleven more I'm gonna drink.

10:23.781 --> 10:27.350
C'mon, he's an independent trucker...
A small business owner,

10:27.418 --> 10:30.587
out here busting his hump to
provide for his family...

10:30.655 --> 10:34.658
I'm tellin ya, guys like him
are the lifeblood of America.

10:34.725 --> 10:38.094
Not to mention he's driving us
non-stop straight to Manhattan.

10:38.162 --> 10:41.164
Exactly, which should
take about three hours.

10:41.231 --> 10:44.167
Which equals twelve beers.

10:44.234 --> 10:46.903
Ugh, okay, here's
your fur coat, from the world's

10:46.970 --> 10:48.672
farthest-away cold storage.

10:48.739 --> 10:51.808
Wh-? Did they tell you
to put it in a headlock?!

10:51.875 --> 10:52.642
No.

10:52.710 --> 10:53.610
Well?!

10:53.678 --> 10:54.544
I don't know!

10:54.612 --> 10:56.012
They were like, Persian!

10:56.802 --> 10:57.880
You lost me.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.749
Cadillac's not my real last name.

10:59.817 --> 11:03.886
I -- well yeah, I figured
the odds on that were pretty huge.

11:03.954 --> 11:04.921
I changed it.

11:04.988 --> 11:06.122
From Kazinsky.

11:06.190 --> 11:09.959
And before I sold cars... I stole 'em.

11:10.027 --> 11:10.927
You what?!

11:10.994 --> 11:17.801
I mean, this was years and years ago...
Me, Tony, Donny, Joey

11:17.868 --> 11:19.336
and Fat Mike.

11:19.403 --> 11:23.239
That was my crew. And kiddo,
we'd boost anything on wheels.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.376
Or one time, ya know, not even on wheels.

11:26.444 --> 11:29.312
That was forty-five, though,
that didn't hurt the war effort.

11:29.380 --> 11:33.115
Anyhoo... One day it dawns on
me, we're doin' all this work,

11:33.183 --> 11:38.921
but the guys makin' the real money own
the chop shops... So we revised our

11:38.989 --> 11:40.457
business model.

11:40.524 --> 11:45.695
For a few years, lemme tell ya
kid, we were going gangbusters.

11:45.763 --> 11:50.600
Until one day, I'm out gettin meatball
subs for the crew, and... boom.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.300
The cops got all of 'em.

11:51.369 --> 11:53.169
Aw, Fat Mike too?

11:53.237 --> 11:53.877
All of 'em.

11:53.904 --> 11:56.906
And they all got twenty years,
because not one of 'em,

11:56.974 --> 11:59.409
not one of 'em gave me up.

11:59.477 --> 12:03.012
Anyway, I used our stash to buy
a legit used car lot, and then

12:03.080 --> 12:06.249
my first dealership, and eventually--
Six, yeah, got it.

12:06.316 --> 12:09.051
- So the money is...
- The least I can do.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.921
It's like back pay, for
all the years they lost.

12:11.989 --> 12:15.992
Plus most of it's from charging poor
saps for that frickin' undercoating.

12:16.059 --> 12:16.926
Never.

12:16.994 --> 12:18.661
Get the undercoating.

12:18.729 --> 12:21.898
But I still don't know who keeps
hiring goons to stick me up.

12:21.965 --> 12:23.032
Yes, you do.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.267
What're you talking about?

12:24.334 --> 12:27.837
Ron, who hasn't been complaining
about not getting his money?

12:27.905 --> 12:31.207
Son of a... Fat Mike!

12:31.275 --> 12:33.209
Wait'll the crew hears this!

12:33.277 --> 12:35.745
He'll be eatin his meatball
subs through a straw.

12:35.813 --> 12:38.381
Wow, and here Mother
thinks you are hands down the

12:38.449 --> 12:41.984
most boringest man on this
entire planet of Earth.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.920
Wh-? She said that?!

12:43.987 --> 12:48.758
- I mean... - He is hands down
the most boringest man on this

12:48.826 --> 12:51.895
entire planet of Earth.

12:51.962 --> 12:54.731
Not in those exact words, but--
She thinks I'm boring?!

12:54.799 --> 12:58.367
Well not after you tell her
you stole a Sherman tank, Master P!

12:58.436 --> 13:00.970
No no no, you can
never tell her about that!

13:01.038 --> 13:03.039
I'm serious, about any of it!

13:03.106 --> 13:05.207
I --
None of it! Do you hear me?!

13:05.275 --> 13:07.043
- Okay!
- That's all behind me!

13:07.110 --> 13:09.712
I'm -- almost completely legit now!

13:09.780 --> 13:11.848
You gotta promise me you're
not going to tell her!

13:11.916 --> 13:13.688
Okay! I promise!

13:14.132 --> 13:16.576
Not that I'll ever get the chance...

13:17.157 --> 13:22.589
Hey guys, if that's, ya know...
how you selfidentify.

13:26.949 --> 13:27.782
Wow.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.783
Okay, so...

13:30.610 --> 13:35.548
Apparently we have stumbled
into what I'm just gonna assume is --

13:35.858 --> 13:39.608
-- some kind of unspeakably
rapey snuff film --

13:40.016 --> 13:43.126
yep, look at that, there's even a craft services table...

13:43.348 --> 13:45.656
- But my uh...
- Stepdad.

13:45.776 --> 13:49.271
Mother's husband, has to
be back in time for the opera,

13:49.391 --> 13:52.760
I know, rich people problems,
so even though all you guys

13:52.828 --> 13:56.397
have bats and pipes and --
wow, Shorty over there's got a

13:56.465 --> 14:02.503
club with lumps on it, kickin it Bedrock
style -- does anybody have a gun.

14:02.571 --> 14:04.215
Anybody? Gun?

14:04.335 --> 14:07.993
Probably looks a little
something like this? No?

14:08.113 --> 14:11.144
Okay, so I guess just me then.

14:11.212 --> 14:14.281
Now, for various reasons which
frankly don't concern you,

14:14.349 --> 14:15.416
we can't call the police,

14:15.484 --> 14:17.342
so we're just gonna go, but --

14:17.462 --> 14:19.823
What?!
No no no no no, screw that!

14:19.943 --> 14:21.465
Shoot these degenerate pricks!

14:21.585 --> 14:22.030
Ron?

14:22.156 --> 14:24.690
Starting with C.W. McCall-girl
over there!

14:24.758 --> 14:26.759
- Ron.
- Well at leastkneecap the sonsabitches!

14:26.826 --> 14:28.227
- Ron!
- What?!

14:28.295 --> 14:31.230
What, you outta bullets?!

14:31.298 --> 14:32.698
Well, how the hell was
I supposed to know?!

14:32.766 --> 14:35.668
You saw me shoot the mob guys!

14:35.735 --> 14:38.737
- So?!
- So it holds a finite number of bullets!

14:38.805 --> 14:40.873
It's not a frickin phaser!

14:40.941 --> 14:43.943
A what?

14:44.010 --> 14:47.880
Oh my God! It's just like
Carol said the old gypsy woman said!

14:47.948 --> 14:49.915
Yeah, she said
it would be like some freaky

14:49.983 --> 14:53.752
parallel universe, where John
Waters directed "The Road Warrior"!

14:53.820 --> 14:54.554
Uh-huh.

14:54.621 --> 14:55.921
Then what, they kill me?

14:55.989 --> 15:00.059
No, shut up,
that's the awesome part!

15:00.127 --> 15:03.028
There it is! Look, Ron!
The train!

15:03.097 --> 15:05.198
I gotta start going to that gypsy.

15:05.265 --> 15:10.603
- We'll never... we can't make it...
- Yes we can!

15:10.670 --> 15:14.407
If... dammit, if only there
was a way to slow them down!

15:14.475 --> 15:15.308
Make it rain?

15:15.375 --> 15:16.215
What am I, an Indian?

15:16.243 --> 15:17.676
Pacman Jones!

15:17.744 --> 15:19.778
Oh.

15:19.846 --> 15:20.980
Huh-uh! No!

15:21.047 --> 15:23.516
Yes, Ron! You
don't defy the gypsy!

15:23.584 --> 15:24.624
What about my crew?!

15:24.651 --> 15:26.685
I've been ripped off
the last three times!

15:26.753 --> 15:28.454
What're they supposed to live on?!

15:28.522 --> 15:31.757
What're they gonna live on
if you're eaten by tranny bikers?!

15:31.825 --> 15:33.192
Ron, look!

15:33.260 --> 15:38.364
We'd already be dead if they weren't in...
disturbingly sexy high heels!

15:40.200 --> 15:41.667
Oh, half.

15:41.735 --> 15:43.375
Okay, that's still a baller move.

15:43.403 --> 15:46.939
Master P would totally be proud.

15:48.675 --> 15:50.510
Or he'd release a diss track.

15:50.577 --> 15:52.711
What is it -- half the time
I don't even know what the hell

15:52.779 --> 15:53.846
you're talking about!

15:53.913 --> 15:57.617
Well guess what! Me neither!

15:57.684 --> 16:00.553
That son of a -- Come on,
we've got a train to catch!

16:00.621 --> 16:01.154
Diss tracks.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.756
Jesus Christ, why'd we even fight a war?

16:03.823 --> 16:04.323
Ron!

16:04.324 --> 16:05.891
What, I'm serious!

16:05.959 --> 16:08.794
So's this train, asshole!

16:08.862 --> 16:10.129
Oh, I'm the asshole?!

16:10.197 --> 16:12.131
It's -- just get a running start!

16:12.199 --> 16:15.000
I'm not jumping on that damn thing!

16:15.068 --> 16:16.735
Really?!

16:16.803 --> 16:17.537
How bout now?!

16:17.604 --> 16:21.207
Son of a...!

16:21.275 --> 16:25.110
Come on! Run like you're younger!

16:25.179 --> 16:26.546
Okay, now gimme your hand!

16:26.613 --> 16:27.547
I can't!

16:27.614 --> 16:29.048
Yes you can!

16:29.115 --> 16:30.082
Rrrrrrngh!

16:30.150 --> 16:32.785
C'mon grab it, grab it!

16:32.852 --> 16:36.121
- Well now hang on a second...
- What're you doing?!

16:36.190 --> 16:39.525
Thinking about how much I
hate it that Mother married you!

16:39.593 --> 16:42.828
You don't hate it she married me --
No, yeah, I --

16:42.896 --> 16:45.565
you hate it she married anybody!

16:45.632 --> 16:48.267
Cause you want her all to yourself!

16:48.335 --> 16:49.975
- What?!
- Paging Doctor Bates!

16:50.003 --> 16:52.171
Doctor Norman Bates --
Hey shut up!

16:52.239 --> 16:53.972
And also eww!

16:54.040 --> 16:59.745
And --
Sterling, please!

16:59.813 --> 17:00.613
Oh my God.

17:00.681 --> 17:01.914
Thank you, Sterling.

17:01.981 --> 17:03.549
You're welcome, shut up.

17:03.617 --> 17:07.920
- Norman Bates. Ya know...
- I apologize, that was out of line.

17:07.987 --> 17:15.428
But come on, you gotta admit the
relationship you two have is... unhealthy.

17:15.494 --> 17:19.865
No, Ron, I don't have
to admit that, because --

17:19.933 --> 17:23.167
Okay, try not to ruin it this time.

17:24.904 --> 17:26.705
Waaaaaaaooof!

17:26.772 --> 17:29.208
- Jesus...
- Yeah, you see how their legs broke?

17:29.276 --> 17:31.510
That's because they didn't
use the parachute fall.

17:31.578 --> 17:33.679
Which I don't have time to
teach you properly, but --

17:33.747 --> 17:34.580
Why would you want to?

17:34.648 --> 17:37.250
I -- because I
take pride in my work?

17:37.317 --> 17:39.952
Why would you teach
it to me it at all?!

17:40.019 --> 17:41.787
Oh. We gotta jump off the train.

17:41.855 --> 17:44.490
RON Wh-?! We just jumped on the train!

17:44.558 --> 17:46.726
Yeah, and it's going
about twenty miles an hour, and

17:46.793 --> 17:50.896
there goes a sign for Catskill, so --
So it'll take six hours to get home.

17:50.964 --> 17:54.032
If we don't get
rousted by the bulls.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.302
I also don't have time to
teach you how to speak hobo.

17:56.370 --> 18:00.239
But wait a minute, hang on, why
would you want me to make the opera?

18:00.307 --> 18:02.941
I dunno, maybe you
were right about a few things,

18:03.009 --> 18:06.679
and maybe you're good for Mother, and...
maybe shut up

18:06.747 --> 18:08.648
before I lose my temper again.

18:08.715 --> 18:11.850
- I got a dealership in Catskill...
- So we grab a Caddy

18:11.918 --> 18:12.918
and drive in style.

18:12.986 --> 18:16.622
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we could just make it...
But it's going too fast to jump off!

18:16.690 --> 18:18.090
Look at those poles zipping by!

18:18.158 --> 18:19.759
No, no, no, don't
look at the poles!

18:19.826 --> 18:21.494
They give you a false perspective!

18:21.561 --> 18:28.200
Try and focus on a distant
landmark, like -- The ground.

18:28.268 --> 18:30.569
Woooooooo!

18:30.637 --> 18:33.372
Hey! See how I did that?

18:33.440 --> 18:36.942
Ron?

18:37.010 --> 18:38.877
Seven-thirty! We just might make it!

18:38.945 --> 18:39.812
You sure he'll be out there?

18:39.879 --> 18:41.914
He better be.

18:41.981 --> 18:46.485
- Yeah, there he is...
- Here you go, sir.

18:46.553 --> 18:47.986
I took the liberty of taking in

18:48.054 --> 18:49.555
the jacket a bit, and --

18:49.623 --> 18:50.623
- Woodhouse.
- Yessir?

18:50.691 --> 18:52.692
Doesn't even come close
to making up for leaving me

18:52.759 --> 18:54.092
stranded in Montreal.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.227
No sir.

18:55.295 --> 18:56.595
So go get ready.

18:56.663 --> 19:00.132
Your punishment will begin when I get
back from dropping him off at the opera.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.234
Wait, you think that's a good idea?

19:02.302 --> 19:03.035
Ron?

19:03.102 --> 19:06.138
Look, I know we accidentally
bonded a little, but do not

19:06.206 --> 19:08.607
tell me how to discipline my servant!

19:08.675 --> 19:09.835
I meant dropping me off.

19:09.876 --> 19:16.582
- If your mother thinks we're all buddy-buddy...
- Yeah, that would drive her insane...

19:19.519 --> 19:22.287
Sometimes I think
I should just run away.

19:22.356 --> 19:24.189
But who would take me in?

19:24.257 --> 19:27.893
No one, Woodhouse... no one.

19:27.961 --> 19:30.730
And just what
in the hell is this?

19:30.797 --> 19:32.631
Just dropping off my buddy Ron!

19:32.699 --> 19:33.399
Buddy?!

19:33.467 --> 19:35.968
Why, how, and since when?!

19:36.035 --> 19:39.171
Long story babe, and look,
we really gotta hustle if we

19:39.239 --> 19:40.506
wanna make that curtain!

19:40.574 --> 19:45.544
Yeah, and I gotta go make an
old man eat a big bowl of spiderwebs.

19:45.612 --> 19:49.448
See ya buddy!

19:51.485 --> 19:57.573
Duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh...

19:57.693 --> 20:05.343
Duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh...

20:06.462 --> 20:09.835
Woodhouse, I'm gonna check that bowl!

20:15.157 --> 20:16.219
Good day.
