01:56.182 --> 01:57.382
Fuck.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.068
<i> Don't ask me</i>
<i> what happened,</i>

02:16.070 --> 02:18.303
<i> because I don't have</i>
<i> all the answers.</i>

02:20.173 --> 02:22.040
<i> There is no one here</i>
<i> to tell us.</i>

02:24.477 --> 02:26.778
<i> I can put bits</i>
<i> and pieces together,</i>

02:28.448 --> 02:30.149
<i> but it won't add up to much.</i>

02:33.620 --> 02:35.120
<i> Why can't I remember?</i>

02:37.757 --> 02:39.191
<i> May be it's better I don't.</i>

04:18.324 --> 04:19.791
<i> Same path as yesterday,</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:22.160
<i> and the day before,</i>

04:22.929 --> 04:24.796
<i> and the day before that.</i>

04:24.798 --> 04:26.932
<i> It's me walking,</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:28.800
<i> but it's like</i>
<i> I'm not really there.</i>

04:29.535 --> 04:31.670
<i> The real me is somewhere else.</i>

04:31.672 --> 04:33.171
<i> Somewhere better.</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:20.218
Hey.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.454
Hey.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.823
Damn. You look even uglier
than you did yesterday.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.792
Yeah? Well,
you sound like a hillbilly.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.329
Hey, I got
something for you.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.737
I know you like
that kind of stuff.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.306
Thanks, man.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.576
What does it say?

05:44.578 --> 05:46.311
I never made it to cursive.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.051
How far have you gone?

05:54.120 --> 05:55.187
North?

05:55.189 --> 05:56.254
Yeah.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.157
Here.

06:00.727 --> 06:02.461
All right, everyone.
Take your seats.

06:02.463 --> 06:02.461
Class is starting.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.030
Oh,
here comes tough dude

06:05.698 --> 06:07.432
how about you shut up?

06:07.434 --> 06:10.035
Sit down!
No more fucking around.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.670
Yo!

06:11.672 --> 06:13.305
Teach said
shut the fuck up!

06:13.307 --> 06:15.107
- Shut up!

06:15.109 --> 06:17.576
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Get off.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.144
- Hey!
- -Come on, get up.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.212
Get up.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.414
Stand up yourself.

06:24.851 --> 06:25.917
Pussy!

06:25.919 --> 06:28.720
Hey! Do you wanna
walk the line? Hmm?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.522
No, sir.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.258
-Sorry, sir.
-Yeah. Pussy!

06:34.260 --> 06:35.327
Leave the class.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.295
Start it off.

06:40.333 --> 06:44.603
I pledge allegiance
to the flag of
the United States of America.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.238
There is no before.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.273
There is no yesterday.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.975
There is only today.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.944
And today,
i prepare for tomorrow.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.601
Today, we're going to learn
how to find clean water.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.372
The single most
important thing you need
to live is water.

07:20.374 --> 07:21.973
If you're resourceful,
know where to look,

07:21.975 --> 07:25.544
you can find it, collect it,
go drink your water
just about anywhere.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.780
If you're lost in the wild,
chances are you'll be
exerting yourself.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.249
And you may be in a hot
or cold environment.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.208
Hey,
what are you doing?

08:30.210 --> 08:32.409
Getting supplies.
-Hold up.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.679
You're wanted
back at the class.

08:58.437 --> 09:01.706
-Get to class!
-Yes, sir, brother, sir.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.993
All right, everybody.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.462
Okay.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.065
So how many of you all
ever been to a hospital?

09:28.701 --> 09:30.502
Any of you all
ever break a bone?

09:31.637 --> 09:32.704
Okay, listen.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.226
Tell me what it's about.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.472
All right.
That was three bells.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.307
-That was three, right?
-Yeah!

10:09.309 --> 10:10.642
Let's see who it is.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.483
The rules are the rules.

10:19.885 --> 10:22.187
One of us
has broken the rules.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.890
One of us has something
they shouldn't have.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.065
This doesn't
belong here anymore.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.168
He turned his back on us,

10:38.804 --> 10:41.339
so we turn our backs on him.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.178
Bring him out.

11:06.632 --> 11:08.600
Gentry.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.301
It's your turn
to judge a rule breaker.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.266
The line.

11:47.673 --> 11:48.740
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.610
You made a choice.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.480
You can't be here anymore.

11:55.482 --> 11:59.851
We live together here, or we
fend for ourselves out there.

12:01.954 --> 12:03.354
I'm sorry.

12:38.224 --> 12:42.093
Once you walk through to the
other side, you can't return.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.997
You leave the way
you got here,

12:45.999 --> 12:48.566
with whatever
you carried on your back.

13:12.391 --> 13:15.093
<i> It's fear</i>
<i> that keeps us here,</i>

13:15.095 --> 13:16.828
<i> fear of what's out there.</i>

13:17.496 --> 13:18.763
<i> Starvation,</i>

13:19.865 --> 13:21.299
<i> isolation,</i>

13:21.967 --> 13:23.334
<i> predators.</i>

13:24.537 --> 13:26.437
<i> These things exist here too.</i>

13:50.729 --> 13:52.964
Oh, dude.
I wish it was that guy
from the first period.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.032
Yeah.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.736
Did you see that?
He nearly actually
pissed himself.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.139
Oh, shut up!
You'd shit yourself
if you walked the line.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.507
Hey! Jesus!

14:02.509 --> 14:03.842
Where the fuck
have you been?

14:03.844 --> 14:05.610
Why,
did you miss me?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.145
- Miss you?
- What?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.479
Hey, come on, bro.

15:20.619 --> 15:21.920
Hi!

15:23.188 --> 15:25.523
Your dad will be
home in a sec, Willie too.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.059
Go finish your homework.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.127
I did.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.596
You're a horrible liar.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.097
Sit down.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.503
How's school?

15:39.338 --> 15:41.139
The same. How's work?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.842
Same. Smart ass.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.745
Want to trade?

15:47.747 --> 15:49.714
Not a chance.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.268
Hey! You on your way?

16:12.905 --> 16:14.572
Martin,
stop fucking around. What?

16:16.041 --> 16:18.576
Where? What...
What are you talking about?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.278
Martin, I'm listening, I...

16:20.280 --> 16:22.213
I just don't understand.
What happened?

16:25.351 --> 16:26.417
God!

16:34.693 --> 16:37.695
Ha-ha!
Got him. You see that?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.630
Jack needs
to walk this line.
Oh!

16:43.335 --> 16:44.502
You see that?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.770
Hey, fuck you.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.618
Trigger line.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.686
Bait stick.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.754
Snare.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.956
Remember them,
they're important.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.226
In case you run into one,
you're gonna have to learn

19:55.228 --> 19:58.696
how to dismantle
an ied or tripwire.

20:33.198 --> 20:35.299
-What?
-Water's for everyone.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.568
Oh, I think you've got
some work to do over there.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.672
-Thirsty.
-No? Oh. Oh, yeah, okay.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.141
You're right. You're right.
The water is for everyone.

20:46.678 --> 20:47.745
Um...

20:48.413 --> 20:50.181
I'm sorry. I just...

21:06.932 --> 21:08.299
Hey, here you go.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.440
Oh.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.991
We don't know
how much longer

21:33.993 --> 21:35.626
we have left on this planet.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.830
Might as well try
to enjoy it, right?

21:48.241 --> 21:49.307
Fuck!
-Shit.

21:56.782 --> 21:57.848
Fuck!

22:01.353 --> 22:04.188
Caleb! No,
he didn't do anything!

22:19.438 --> 22:20.938
Are you crazy?

22:22.541 --> 22:23.908
Thirsty?

23:11.857 --> 23:13.057
Hey!

23:14.526 --> 23:15.593
Um...

23:17.462 --> 23:19.330
I want to
show you something.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.600
Yeah, all right.

23:33.044 --> 23:35.246
You brought me
all the way here.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.169
You did this?

23:59.471 --> 24:00.604
Yeah.

24:01.406 --> 24:03.040
Where does it go?

24:03.542 --> 24:04.842
Somewhere safe.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.243
How do you know that?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.712
I don't.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.048
But I believe it.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.719
I'm leaving tomorrow
before the first bell.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.055
I can't go back now.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.958
Gentry's not going to let
what happened today slide.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.260
I should go,
if Caleb knew I was here...

24:23.262 --> 24:24.662
I found this today.

24:25.931 --> 24:27.031
You know what it is?

24:28.333 --> 24:29.400
A leaf?

24:30.101 --> 24:32.636
Means fall is coming early.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.705
Did you see that pile of
wood outside the school?

24:34.707 --> 24:35.906
Mmm-hmm.

24:36.842 --> 24:38.943
Early fall means early winter.

24:40.278 --> 24:42.413
How long do think
that wood will really last
in the winter?

24:42.415 --> 24:47.785
First snowfall,
we have two weeks'
worth of supplies at best.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.420
Even less food.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.857
How many kids
we got at school now, like 50?

24:54.359 --> 24:56.660
How many do you think we'll
have in the coming spring?

24:57.462 --> 24:59.663
What do you suppose
we do about it?

25:01.933 --> 25:03.968
When it happened,
we were driving north.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.804
My dad said
it would be safe there.

25:08.406 --> 25:12.009
He heard all these stories
about them taking
survivors up there

25:12.011 --> 25:13.511
even after that night.

25:15.313 --> 25:16.347
Maybe there's a reason.

25:16.349 --> 25:19.917
Those stories...
They're just stories.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.820
You can't just go north.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.321
You don't know
what's out there.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.057
I know what's here.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.429
So what's stopping you?

25:39.538 --> 25:40.638
I should go.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.607
Hey.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.144
Just think about it.

25:48.079 --> 25:49.146
And Jessie?

25:51.616 --> 25:53.684
Don't tell anyone. Okay?

26:02.328 --> 26:03.427
Just cut all of it off.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.231
Barber Connor over here
doing pretty good.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.900
- I got next.
- All right.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.836
Hey, let me
get that score, bro.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.816
Hey, are you okay, man?

26:30.055 --> 26:31.121
Yo, what happened
today exactly?

26:36.161 --> 26:37.227
I told you.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.832
Nasty kid just stacked some
wood and he just flipped out.

26:46.304 --> 26:47.605
What can you do?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.741
Want a beer?

27:23.942 --> 27:25.309
Where were you?

27:25.311 --> 27:26.944
Get inside.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.646
I said, where were you?

27:28.648 --> 27:31.015
Caleb, it's almost dark
outside. Are you crazy?

27:32.751 --> 27:33.984
Hey, guess what?

27:34.819 --> 27:37.621
It's none of
your damn business.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.824
"Where were you?"

27:40.826 --> 27:43.460
-Geez. What, are you trying
to act like dad again?
-Are you drunk?

27:48.900 --> 27:52.469
I said,
get in the damn house!

27:55.840 --> 27:56.907
Fine!

27:57.575 --> 27:58.642
Or don't.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.145
Whoa. Hey!

28:40.018 --> 28:41.085
Caleb!

28:42.387 --> 28:43.454
No!

28:43.822 --> 28:45.155
You asshole!

28:45.157 --> 28:46.990
This is
dad's favorite picture!

28:46.992 --> 28:48.325
-He...
-Jessie!

28:49.461 --> 28:50.994
Dad's dead.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.164
Okay?

28:55.734 --> 28:57.835
Well, if he is dead,

28:57.837 --> 29:00.170
at least he's not here
to see how you turned out.

29:17.455 --> 29:18.689
--It's okay.

29:19.124 --> 29:20.224
Hey.

29:50.321 --> 29:53.090
It's almost dark, man,
I'm gonna head home.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.825
-It's cool.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.863
Hey!

30:00.598 --> 30:01.665
What?

30:05.503 --> 30:07.371
Well, I've been
thinking about today...

30:08.206 --> 30:09.339
Yeah?

30:09.341 --> 30:11.508
I can't let that kind
of shit happen anymore.

30:12.076 --> 30:13.343
All right.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.746
You know,
winter's coming and...

30:15.748 --> 30:17.281
And then what?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.617
We need all these kids
to be working.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.320
All of them.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.755
Yeah. You're right.

30:25.890 --> 30:28.692
That fucking kid's
got to get it tomorrow. No?

30:29.794 --> 30:31.028
You want
all these kids to work,

30:31.030 --> 30:33.197
we've got to make an example
out of the bad ones, right?

30:35.099 --> 30:36.166
Yeah.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.670
But just him, okay?

30:39.672 --> 30:40.737
Okay.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.472
That's it.

30:42.974 --> 30:44.041
All right.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.610
All right.

30:49.714 --> 30:52.316
-Can I go now?
-Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.650
See you tomorrow.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.505
Mom, what's going on?

31:48.507 --> 31:50.440
-We have to go.
-Where?

31:50.442 --> 31:51.742
Up to the cabin.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.011
Come on, let's go.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.046
Oh, my god.
There's blood on you!

31:56.048 --> 31:57.347
Are you hurt?

31:59.951 --> 32:01.618
It's not mine.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.020
Come on, let's move!

32:08.293 --> 32:09.860
-You ready?
-Yes.

32:09.862 --> 32:11.628
Together. On three, okay?

32:11.630 --> 32:13.931
One, two, three!

32:43.995 --> 32:45.495
<i> There is no before,</i>

32:47.332 --> 32:48.899
<i> there is no tomorrow,</i>

32:51.002 --> 32:52.402
<i> there is only today.</i>

32:55.306 --> 32:57.908
<i> And today, everything changes.</i>

32:59.711 --> 33:01.378
<i> Today, I leave</i>
<i> this shithole behind.</i>

33:04.048 --> 33:06.783
<i> Whatever is up there,</i>
<i> doesn't matter.</i>

33:09.187 --> 33:11.021
<i> Anything's better than here.</i>

33:49.594 --> 33:51.962
<i> Some people say</i>
<i> there's nothing up north.</i>

33:56.634 --> 33:58.502
<i> Some say</i>
<i> there's others up there.</i>

33:59.170 --> 34:00.670
<i> Survivors.</i>

34:04.675 --> 34:06.476
<i> I don't know what I'll find,</i>

34:08.079 --> 34:09.746
<i> but I know where I'm going.</i>

34:52.489 --> 34:53.556
--Whoa...

34:55.659 --> 34:56.726
You're late.

34:57.328 --> 34:58.562
I'm here, aren't I?

34:59.497 --> 35:01.031
Are you ready?

35:01.033 --> 35:02.833
Yeah, let's go see
what's out there.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.602
All right. Let's go!

35:24.021 --> 35:25.622
Jessie!

35:34.866 --> 35:36.333
Jessie!

36:00.091 --> 36:01.525
So, where are we going?

36:01.527 --> 36:03.994
North. That way.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.495
For how long?

36:09.834 --> 36:12.502
So, we're here,
we have to go there.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.007
So, better get moving.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.488
- Well, there he is.
-Ooh!

36:31.490 --> 36:32.589
What's up, man?

36:32.591 --> 36:33.890
-What's up?
-You're late.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.759
- They're gonna make you
walk the line.

36:35.761 --> 36:39.496
That's a good one.
Except you know this place
would fall to shit without me.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.298
-That's true.
-It's true.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.301
Did you see
my sister this morning?

36:45.203 --> 36:46.303
Nope.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.471
It's weird, man. I woke
up and she was just gone.

36:48.473 --> 36:52.008
You did make her cry last
night, man. Maybe she ran out.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.343
Probably still running.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.545
That's not funny, man.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.314
I didn't say it was.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.816
Look.
She's probably skipping.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.285
Don't worry about it.
Maybe she's already inside.

37:02.287 --> 37:05.488
Well, you know, that Josh
pussy never came
to school neither.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.291
It's a shame.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.627
- I had a surprise for him.

37:13.331 --> 37:15.265
Today, we're going
to learn about tracking.

37:15.267 --> 37:18.468
Hunting animals for food isn't
a skill that comes easily.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.471
To find your prey,
you have to know the basics.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.341
Easiest places to find tracks
are snow, wet sand...

37:27.278 --> 37:28.445
Not here.

37:28.879 --> 37:29.946
Let's go.

37:44.228 --> 37:45.662
Let's go in and eat.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.438
Where'd you get
all this stuff?

37:56.807 --> 37:58.375
I've been saving my rations
every other day.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.778
Josh, I can't eat this.
It's your food.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.780
You should've
eaten this before.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.148
There is no before,
remember?

38:07.351 --> 38:09.486
And besides,
it's all of ours.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.087
I've brought enough
for both of us.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.392
How'd you know I'd come?

38:17.194 --> 38:18.395
I didn't.

38:19.196 --> 38:20.263
You're stupid.

38:21.499 --> 38:22.565
Good stupid.

38:43.888 --> 38:45.655
We're going to be okay.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.590
No one knows
where we're going.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.738
You know, I've never
ditched school before.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.208
I have, once.
-Really? When?

39:05.210 --> 39:06.643
- Today.

39:15.052 --> 39:16.553
Bet I can hit it
before you.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.421
No way.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.223
Go ahead.

39:34.071 --> 39:36.806
- I'm gonna aim for
the south of it.
-Okay.

39:46.150 --> 39:47.550
Yo,
what're you doin', man?

39:51.155 --> 39:53.022
Jessie!

39:53.024 --> 39:54.991
Hey, pussy,
we're here!

41:07.231 --> 41:08.965
Yo, Caleb.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.800
Yo, I'm in here.

41:19.009 --> 41:20.410
What the fuck is this?

41:21.111 --> 41:23.112
I don't know.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.881
It's obviously something
he didn't want us to see.

41:40.130 --> 41:41.764
Oh, fuck.

41:43.367 --> 41:44.567
It's a map.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.841
We can't spare you.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.843
What if everybody else thinks
they can just leave?

41:54.745 --> 41:56.045
We need everybody.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.147
He's right.

41:58.649 --> 41:59.983
Give me the key.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.286
Look, I'm gonna find her.

42:04.221 --> 42:05.855
I'm gonna bring her back.

42:07.024 --> 42:09.325
It's the only way to make sure
everyone keeps working.

42:09.727 --> 42:10.860
And Josh?

42:13.264 --> 42:14.330
We'll handle him.

42:34.351 --> 42:35.785
This is
the only way through.

42:36.954 --> 42:38.021
Come on.

42:51.135 --> 42:52.535
Be careful.

42:52.537 --> 42:53.703
Is this safe?

42:54.204 --> 42:55.405
Probably not.

43:08.352 --> 43:10.987
<i> It's a funny thing</i>
<i> what happens when</i>
<i> no one's in charge.</i>

43:11.889 --> 43:13.156
<i> Everyone adapts.</i>

43:14.191 --> 43:16.092
<i> Patients run the asylum.</i>

43:16.827 --> 43:19.195
<i> The insane become the rulers.</i>

43:19.197 --> 43:20.897
<i> They write the laws.</i>

43:21.865 --> 43:24.100
<i> The rest of us,</i>
<i> we're just inmates.</i>

44:13.517 --> 44:14.584
Jump.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.453
I'm scared of heights.

44:18.622 --> 44:20.857
I really didn't think
this partnership through.

44:24.061 --> 44:25.561
Now, you'll be fine.
Come on.

44:26.864 --> 44:27.930
There you go.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.935
See? Wasn't that bad.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.472
Yeah.

44:41.412 --> 44:42.779
Oh, yeah!

44:42.781 --> 44:44.380
Bro, yeah!

44:49.353 --> 44:50.420
It's not a joke.

44:50.422 --> 44:51.988
Okay.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.656
This could be fun,
you know.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.161
--Josh!

45:51.248 --> 45:52.782
What the fuck is that?

46:19.309 --> 46:20.376
Holy shit.

46:21.812 --> 46:23.346
We've got to
find a different route.

46:23.881 --> 46:23.880
It's going to get dark.

46:23.882 --> 46:27.917
You know, why don't you just
go back if you think
you can make it?

46:30.320 --> 46:31.487
Just joking.

46:33.390 --> 46:35.691
No walking
as the crow flies.

46:35.693 --> 46:37.760
-Fuck.
-It's gonna take a while

46:37.762 --> 46:39.228
before we can
catch up to them.

46:39.230 --> 46:40.463
Well, let's go.

47:07.424 --> 47:09.792
All right. It's getting dark.

47:09.794 --> 47:11.327
We should
find a place to sleep.

47:13.297 --> 47:14.597
What about that?

47:27.678 --> 47:28.978
You ever been sailing?

47:30.347 --> 47:31.681
Think this is safe enough?

47:34.985 --> 47:36.252
Climb aboard.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.921
Aye, aye, captain.

47:59.843 --> 48:00.977
Where did you get that?

48:02.746 --> 48:03.980
I stole it
from my brother.

48:23.300 --> 48:24.834
What do you think?

48:25.969 --> 48:27.036
It's not bad.

48:27.038 --> 48:28.271
I hear it's addictive.

48:39.016 --> 48:41.384
You think Simon is still
out there somewhere?

48:43.220 --> 48:45.154
Yeah. Maybe somewhere.

48:48.792 --> 48:50.693
So, what's up there,
where we're going?

48:52.596 --> 48:53.930
My mom and dad's cabin.

48:55.332 --> 48:56.866
Yeah, but...

48:58.168 --> 49:00.236
What's really up there?

49:11.415 --> 49:13.349
What did you wanna be
when you grow up?

49:13.351 --> 49:16.786
-You go first.
-Firefighter. Your turn.

49:21.224 --> 49:23.192
I wanted to be a cop.

49:23.194 --> 49:24.427
A cop?

49:24.429 --> 49:25.494
Yep.

49:41.011 --> 49:42.545
Why did we get so lucky?

49:44.915 --> 49:46.449
We're lucky?

49:47.918 --> 49:48.985
We're still here.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.556
Maybe they're all still
out there somewhere.

49:57.494 --> 49:58.561
Maybe.

50:23.354 --> 50:24.720
What the hell
is happening up there?

50:24.722 --> 50:25.955
Nothing's moving.
There's nowhere to go.

50:28.291 --> 50:30.626
<i> Stay indoors</i>
<i> until further notice.</i>

50:30.628 --> 50:33.462
<i> Seek shelter.</i>
<i> Do not travel south.</i>

50:33.464 --> 50:35.798
<i> Evacuation points</i>
<i> will be announced shortly.</i>

50:35.800 --> 50:37.633
Shortly, my ass.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.168
Dad, I'm scared.

50:39.170 --> 50:40.403
We're gonna be okay.

50:40.405 --> 50:40.403
What if we're not?

50:42.506 --> 50:46.342
Well, then, we'll just have
to make it okay, then.

50:46.344 --> 50:49.578
-What are you thinking?
-I don't know
but we can't stay here.

50:51.214 --> 50:52.948
There's a back road
over there...

50:52.950 --> 50:54.650
-How do you know it's safe?
-Well, I don't.

50:54.652 --> 50:56.252
But we can stay here

50:56.254 --> 50:58.120
or we can do something.
Hang on.

51:17.607 --> 51:18.674
-Josh.
-What?

51:21.012 --> 51:23.446
--There's something
outside the boat.

51:38.562 --> 51:39.628
Josh!

51:44.301 --> 51:46.302
Do you think these are the
dogs from around school?

51:47.204 --> 51:48.737
I don't know.

51:48.739 --> 51:50.639
We need to get out of here
before they come back.

52:43.994 --> 52:45.327
What are you doing?

52:46.730 --> 52:48.497
Just finding some breakfast.

52:54.037 --> 52:55.404
All right. Come on.

53:29.806 --> 53:31.373
We should just keep going.

53:32.175 --> 53:33.976
You got somewhere
you need to be?

53:37.715 --> 53:39.582
Come on, don't you
wanna see inside?

53:39.584 --> 53:41.183
No, not really.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.186
It'll just be a minute.

54:54.157 --> 54:57.059
-We need to go.
-What's wrong?

54:57.061 --> 54:58.861
We just need to go.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.403
-So, where to next?
-Library.

55:09.806 --> 55:13.309
For once no one's making us go
to school and you wanna
go check out a book?

55:14.911 --> 55:16.845
-Trust me.
-Okay.

55:58.555 --> 55:59.788
What's that smell?

56:03.560 --> 56:05.861
-What?
-Is that perfume?

56:07.564 --> 56:09.965
Yeah. Do you like it?

56:11.134 --> 56:13.235
Yeah. I think so.

56:13.237 --> 56:15.604
Is it supposed
to be that strong?

56:15.606 --> 56:18.207
I don't know. I've never
used perfume before.

56:25.014 --> 56:26.648
There's a harbor
behind the library.

56:26.650 --> 56:28.650
Find a boat, and then
we can take the river.

56:33.590 --> 56:36.859
-I wanna show you something.
-All right, captain.

57:03.820 --> 57:05.421
It's beautiful.

57:08.291 --> 57:09.358
Come on.

57:34.751 --> 57:37.119
-What is it?
-My parents.

57:39.389 --> 57:41.356
M.G. Loves c.S.

57:42.659 --> 57:44.293
Your parents were vandals.

57:46.362 --> 57:47.863
Is there a story there?

57:47.865 --> 57:49.665
They met here when
they were in college.

57:52.135 --> 57:54.903
I don't think I'm gonna
go to college.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.905
What about you?

58:04.814 --> 58:06.615
What are you doing?

58:07.884 --> 58:09.284
Leaving a message.

58:59.669 --> 59:01.870
Go. Check over there.
Check up there.

59:30.099 --> 59:31.433
Caleb.

59:32.101 --> 59:33.869
Look what I found.

59:40.510 --> 59:42.711
- Where did you get this?
- It was down the hall.

59:44.948 --> 59:46.548
Maybe the dogs got 'em.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.919
Come on, this way, this way.
This way!

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.224
Josh. Come on.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:00.322
It's fucking locked.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.338
Hey, help us.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.106
- Help, help.
- Josh! Help!

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.442
Get in.

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:27.282
Ya'll trying
to get yourself killed
or something?

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.525
Crazy-ass fuckers!

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:41.897
Oh.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.869
So, they lost all their gear.
They're fucked, man.

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.342
-Well, she left, remember?
-Hey.

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:55.911
Maybe now they'll
just head back.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.082
Not taking that chance.

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.178
You know,

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.347
you two crazy being out here
on your own.

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.917
You're on your own.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:38.086
Yeah, but I got this.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.156
Is it loaded?

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.125
What do you mean,
"is it loaded?"

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.463
What's your name?

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.166
The name's boatman.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.001
Where are you from?

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.503
From earth.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:01.243
Been out here
since it happened.

01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:03.445
Won't have to see it all
much longer, I think.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.381
What do you mean?

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.617
How old do you think I am?

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.020
- Seventeen?

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:14.790
Eighteen?

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:17.959
Nope, 22.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.961
The oldest person I seen
since it happened.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.097
Since that night,

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:23.732
you ever seen anyone
older than me?

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:27.135
No. I don't think so.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.805
Mortality's changed, man.

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:30.872
You don't know that.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.142
-When is your birthday?
-July 30th.

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.578
And you?

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.949
We don't really celebrate
birthdays anymore.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.524
It's the day after tomorrow.

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:52.127
Well, for me, I just
take this one day at a time.

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:58.266
As long as I keep waking up,
we're good.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.704
So where are you two headed,
anyway?

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.608
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:07.676
What?

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:12.914
My map, it's in my bag.

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:16.017
Shit! If they find my bag,
they're gonna know
where we're going.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.553
We're lost.

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.889
How you lost if you're here?

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:23.258
I don't know the way
without the map.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.761
Just keep moving forward.
Maybe the way will find you.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.479
We're not lost.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.582
What are you
talking about?

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.786
I know where we are.
I know where to go.

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.389
Where?

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:57.525
Over there.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:28.490
All right.
This is as far as I take you.

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.128
Hey, look.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.797
Things gonna happen.
Things always happen.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:39.434
Whether it is good or bad,

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:42.170
things always happen
for a reason. Hmm?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.011
Oh, and hey...

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:00.989
Be careful.

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:39.160
-Are we going the right way?
-Yeah, we are.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.697
See those chimes?

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:44.699
My dad and I used to
walk by them all the time.

01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:46.968
Okay.

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:52.974
Ugh!

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.276
We reek.

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:57.779
Come on.

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:30.145
What, you're gonna
get in the pool
with your clothes on?

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.535
Oh!

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.538
Come on.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.040
I'm not a
very good swimmer.

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:00.642
I'm not going
to let you drown.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.111
If you do, it's on you.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:30.772
I got you.

01:08:32.006 --> 01:08:33.073
Okay.

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.743
- You're good?
-Yeah.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:42.216
So fucking cold.

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:43.917
It's not that bad.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:08.710
What was that?

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:17.051
-Don't tell me
that's a fucking flat.
-Shit. It's flat.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.490
Fuck!

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:26.661
Fuck.

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.064
We have a spare?

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:32.700
Please tell me
we have a spare.

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:09.504
No. No.

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:12.974
No. There's no way.

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.102
So stupid.

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:45.974
Can't believe
i thought
they'd still be alive.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.086
This doesn't mean anything.

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:01.489
That's why we're going north.

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:03.891
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.872
-Just turn around.
-We can't.

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.540
- Just go back home.

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.243
-Let's just go back home.
-We can't!

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:28.816
We can't go back.

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.294
<i> Emergency broadcast.</i>

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:41.529
<i> Stay indoors</i>
<i> until further notice.</i>

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:43.898
<i> Seek shelter,</i>
<i> don not travel south.</i>

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.700
<i> Evacuation points</i>
<i> will be announced...</i>

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.671
Go north. Go north.

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:51.839
Go back to that.
What was that?
I don't know.

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.308
Did you hear that?

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:56.678
My nose is bleeding.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.085
Dad, watch out!

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:09.050
This is it. Home.

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:11.819
Let's go inside.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:28.736
<i> Should have just stayed here.</i>

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.439
Way better
than where we ended up.

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.035
Batteries still work.

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.919
This was my dad's
favorite song.

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.988
I haven't heard music
in forever.

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:03.998
Jessie!

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.034
They're here.

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.377
Where did you get that?

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:17.845
Quit it.

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.748
Josh. No!

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:32.386
Hey!

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.491
Watch out!

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.261
What the fuck
was that?

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.462
You just killed a dog,
man.

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:43.064
We gotta get the fuck
out of here.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.603
Go.
Drive around them.

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:01.382
Turn the light off.
Turn the light off.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.806
Josh?

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:32.880
Josh. Josh!

01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:35.483
-I'm here. I'm here.
-Where were you?

01:17:35.485 --> 01:17:37.785
-I...
-You can't just do that.

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:39.520
-You can't just disappear.
-Jess...

01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:41.322
What if something happened
to me?

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.491
-Jess, I...
-What if something
happened to you?

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:48.696
I'm sorry.
I wanted to surprise you.

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:53.300
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:11.218
-Josh, this is stupid.
-Don't peek.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.154
I can't see anything.
You're covering my eyes.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:17.091
Okay, come here.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:23.264
-Okay, you ready?
-Hmm... ready.

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:24.331
Okay.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:27.301
I was gonna get
you a cake,

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.270
but all the stores were closed
this morning.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.011
Why did you
do this, Josh?

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.413
It's your birthday.

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.719
Yeah, but you know
we don't celebrate birthdays

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.154
and...

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.758
I don't like surprises.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.660
Well, I mean,
i just thought that...

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:55.296
You thought what?

01:18:56.965 --> 01:19:00.301
Why the fuck would I celebrate
one year closer to dying?

01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:03.504
-You don't know that.
-Neither do you.

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:19.720
Oh, no.

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:22.656
What the fuck is that, man?

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:25.559
Sticks and bones.

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:27.728
Holy shit.

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:29.930
Spooky.

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.800
Hey, guys,
maybe we should just...

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:34.902
Maybe we should just what?

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:37.872
Look, look at this shit.

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:40.007
-Let's just go back.
-We're not going back.

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.876
Why not, man?

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:44.278
Skulls and bones in the middle
of the place, man.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.080
-Get out of the fucking car!
-What the fuck?

01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:48.916
-Just get out of my damn car!
-What the fuck, man?

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:51.452
-Get out, you little punk!
-What's your problem?

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.121
Fuck off! Just fuck off!

01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.527
What's your problem, man?

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:13.374
Gentry, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:14.875
They are dead weight.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.412
You wanna find your fucking
sister? Let's just go.

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:21.849
-I'm fucking serious.
-Fuck.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:26.220
-Wait for me.
-Come on. Keep walking.

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:37.631
I'm sorry.

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:44.071
-No. You were right.
-No, I wasn't.

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.579
Thank you.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:53.914
It was really nice.

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:24.678
Hey, stop the car.
Stop the car! Just stop.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.489
There's a river up ahead.
I should get out here.

01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:38.192
If you move up and around it,
we can cut 'em off.

01:21:38.194 --> 01:21:39.493
You sure?

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:41.028
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:42.096
All right.

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.736
Gentry?

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.674
Don't do anything
until I get there.

01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:54.742
I won't.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:56.977
Hurry up.

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.413
- Hurry.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:27.174
I miss
ice cream the most.
-What flavor?

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:30.377
Well, that's easy.
Mint chocolate chip.
What about you?

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:31.612
I'd settle for a warm shower.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.848
We're almost there.

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:55.162
We're not coming back.

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:58.799
Well, he's not. You...

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:02.202
I don't really
care if you do or not.

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:04.738
Hey, look. Just don't hurt
her. I'll come back.

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.041
I'll walk the line.

01:24:07.043 --> 01:24:08.475
Walk the line?

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.378
You don't get it, do you?

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:13.914
I am the line.

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:30.564
Jessie, get up
and go to the car.

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.702
No! He stays.

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:36.770
Caleb, please.

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:41.175
He didn't take me. I left.

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:44.044
I left.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:46.980
Just like him.

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:52.653
Oh.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:58.492
Where did you get this,
gentry?

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.300
How many?

01:25:07.369 --> 01:25:08.435
All of them.

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:13.874
Jessie, get up
and go to the car.

01:25:13.876 --> 01:25:15.142
Uh-uh.

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.681
Jessie, go!

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:22.149
No.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.854
Gentry, stop. I'll do it.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.724
You don't kill people.

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:36.430
Caleb!

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:54.348
Caleb!

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.461
No!

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.786
<i> Maybe there is no god,</i>
<i> like they say.</i>

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.890
<i> I figure</i>
<i> it's like mother nature.</i>

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:47.160
<i> We really don't make</i>
<i> much difference to her.</i>
