some juice?

09:07.580 --> 09:10.120
Your mom got mad
at me for spilling juice.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.880
Eye-twitching mad.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.920
Nah, we can't tell her
we spilled the juice.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.170
So, Grandpa.
What do you think?

09:26.170 --> 09:29.080
Nothing that a little
bleach can't fix.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.580
That's how I keep
my tighty-whities white.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.380
So, can you
help us or not?

09:34.380 --> 09:35.920
That's what
grandpas are for.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.040
I'll you what.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.170
Why don't you guys
go and have some fun?

09:39.170 --> 09:40.380
I'll clean all this up

09:40.380 --> 09:42.710
and I'll finish all
the rest of the chores

09:42.710 --> 09:44.000
on this list.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.710
Nia and Baxter:
Thanks, Grandpa.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.080
That's what
grandpas are for.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.290
You said that already.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.420
Grandpas also
repeat things.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.960
This means
that Tess and I

09:52.960 --> 09:55.620
can go put
our free library
in the lobby.

09:55.620 --> 09:58.460
Come on, Tess.
Let's go get
our library on.

10:00.290 --> 10:03.880
All:
Did she just say
"get our library on"?

10:06.460 --> 10:09.080
And you and I
can head to the roof.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.250
It's drone battle time.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.580
Drone battle?

10:12.580 --> 10:14.960
Tess:
Notice he didn't pop in
on free library.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.710
Yep. A drone battle.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.000
I'm in.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.920
What? But you said
you'd clean up
before Mom gets home.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.330
Your mom's Scut shift
won't be over for hours.

10:23.330 --> 10:27.540
I say attack now,
clean later.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.120
(phone ringing)

10:33.120 --> 10:36.290
Hello? Hello?
Are you calling
about my job listing?

10:36.920 --> 10:40.040
Great, great!
Yeah-- Oh.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.080
Well, um, no, no.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.750
I'm not paying minimum wage.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.830
Oh no, oh no.
I'm paying maximum wage.

10:46.830 --> 10:50.920
Yeah. Well, that means
the maximum I can pay.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.500
How much?

10:53.500 --> 10:56.170
Well, uh, ha,
there's a lot of zeros.

10:56.170 --> 10:59.040
In fact, it's all zeros--
Hello?

11:02.330 --> 11:05.120
Okay. Books are in.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.750
Do you really think
people are gonna know

11:06.750 --> 11:08.040
what a little
free library is?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.750
Ooh! Little free library.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.080
He knows.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.960
Boring... Boring.
Boring!

11:15.960 --> 11:19.120
Ooh. "Hemlines
Through the Ages"?

11:19.120 --> 11:20.080
You should take it.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.420
Oh, I'm gonna.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.960
Did you know the hemline
is the historical cornerstone

11:23.960 --> 11:26.420
upon which
women's fashion is built?

11:26.420 --> 11:30.040
(gasps)
This book belongs
to Raven Baxter?

11:30.040 --> 11:33.170
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
It's my mom's book.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.920
Raven Baxter's your mom?

11:37.750 --> 11:40.420
Uh, yeah. Yeah maybe you can
actually meet her sometime.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.380
Stop it.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.620
I'm gonna read this
cover to cover.

11:46.620 --> 11:47.920
Oh, wait!
Sorry.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.380
Take a book,
leave a book.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.500
Oh, sorry.
I'm just so frazzled.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.620
Here, take that.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.620
I can't wait
to show Basil.

11:54.620 --> 11:56.120
Basil!

11:58.170 --> 12:00.880
See, Tess.
We're saving the nation.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.040
Tess:
Whatever you say, Nia.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.330
Oh no!
Curtis and The Guntz

12:09.330 --> 12:12.040
are almost done
filling their
water balloons.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.040
Don't worry.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.040
Those guys only have
water balloons.

12:16.040 --> 12:21.960
We have guac, salsa,
and marinara balloons.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.210
Ha-ha!

12:23.210 --> 12:26.920
That's what they get
for messing with Chef Victor.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.290
Booker, what are you doing?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.080
Sorry.
I didn't have lunch.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.670
Yes, yes.
That's right.

12:39.670 --> 12:43.210
Maximum wage
means no pay.

12:43.210 --> 12:44.080
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.080
You don't hang up first.
I hang up first.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.210
Okay, hi.
I'm your Scuter, Raven.

12:51.210 --> 12:52.210
Welcome to your Scut ride.

12:52.210 --> 12:54.580
Thank you so much
for picking me up.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.120
I just quit my job
and I could not

12:56.120 --> 12:57.380
get out of there
fast enough.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.290
-Ooh!
-It was a circus.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.330
Ha-ha! Girl.

13:00.330 --> 13:02.290
I've had some jobs
that were total circuses too.

13:02.290 --> 13:04.670
No, I literally worked
for the circus.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.420
My boss was a clown.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.750
Honey, I get it.
I've had some bosses
that were clowns.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.670
He was literally a clown.

13:11.670 --> 13:12.750
I hate clowns.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.250
You couldn't pay me enough
to do that job.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.170
Please. They were
paying me peanuts.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.170
I've had some jobs
where the pay was--

13:18.170 --> 13:20.080
No! Literally peanuts.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.120
So um, you're okay
working for free?

13:26.120 --> 13:28.670
Yes, because I was
getting college credit

13:28.670 --> 13:30.380
for my business class.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.080
Hey! Hey.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.710
What would you say
about getting college credits

13:34.710 --> 13:37.580
for, like, an exciting
upstart fashion company?

13:37.580 --> 13:39.710
Well, I need to see
the workspace.

13:39.710 --> 13:43.380
You know, make sure
it's a neat, clean,
professional environment.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.710
Like, am I gonna
have to share a desk
with a bearded lady?

13:46.830 --> 13:48.120
Well not today, girl.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.380
Take a book,
leave a book?

13:57.210 --> 13:59.210
Hi. Take a book,
leave a book?

14:02.330 --> 14:04.460
Tess. What are
we gonna do?

14:04.460 --> 14:07.960
Tess:
I'd so much rather
be in that drone battle.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.500
Just tell her the truth.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.580
She'll understand.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.210
I gotta go
to the bathroom.

14:16.170 --> 14:17.500
Hey, Nia!

14:17.500 --> 14:19.710
We heard you have
a little free library
over here.

14:19.710 --> 14:24.330
You did? You know,
it's national book month.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.670
And that's why
we're gonna take
all of your books.

14:26.670 --> 14:28.710
Great!
Take them, please.

14:32.210 --> 14:35.830
Uh, but you guys know
you've got to take books,
leave books.

14:35.830 --> 14:38.580
Don't worry.
You'll get these back
soon enough.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.500
Well, there's only
one book left.

14:45.750 --> 14:46.920
And it's not even a book.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.170
It's Sebastian's notebook.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.670
Hey.

14:52.790 --> 14:54.080
This is actually really good.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.620
Well, here we are.
At my very professional
work environment.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.830
I hope so because
I like you, Raven,

15:04.830 --> 15:06.250
and I think we could be
a good fit.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.500
Raven:
I've almost got her. Yes!

15:12.830 --> 15:16.210
Ooh. Someone's gonna get it.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.540
-Is something wrong?
-No, no, no.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.170
Nothing's wrong at all.
Actually, um...

15:27.170 --> 15:28.790
My very efficient
clean-up crew

15:28.790 --> 15:30.710
just needs
a little bit more time.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.750
And while
I'm checking in on them...

15:32.750 --> 15:34.210
Why don't you, um...

15:34.210 --> 15:37.620
Why don't you check out
my home rooftop office?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.750
It's amazing.
Go check it out.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.250
It's open air,
natural lighting.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.040
Up, up.
Up, up, up.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.330
Go. Keep going.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.620
Okay now.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.920
Dad! Kids!

15:50.920 --> 15:52.420
Are you serious?

15:52.420 --> 15:55.460
Pink clothes?
A kiddie pool?

15:55.460 --> 15:59.000
Ooh, a whole lot of people
are gonna get it.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.710
♪ ♪

16:27.120 --> 16:28.330
-Booker.
-What?

16:28.330 --> 16:29.830
Stop eating the ammo.

16:29.830 --> 16:31.790
Well, I tied some.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.710
It's like Nia's library.

16:33.710 --> 16:36.330
You tie some,
you eat some.

16:37.540 --> 16:40.710
But we only made
four balloons. Come on!

16:40.710 --> 16:42.000
Hurry.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.170
Curtis and The Guntz' drones
will be here any minute.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.670
Tess:
Uh-oh.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.580
Tess, if you didn't want
to do the library with me,

16:52.580 --> 16:54.540
why didn't you just tell me?

16:54.540 --> 16:55.960
Tess:
'Cause I'm scared of you.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.330
'Cause I wanted to be
supportive of you.

17:01.580 --> 17:02.880
Incoming!

17:04.500 --> 17:05.960
Bob and weave, kids.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.500
Don't let the enemy
get a fixed target.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.830
(Nia screams)

17:15.120 --> 17:17.170
(all screaming)

17:17.170 --> 17:18.580
These are my books
from the library.

17:18.580 --> 17:19.830
They're dropping my books.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.380
They destroyed
all of our ammo.

17:25.380 --> 17:26.330
They won.

17:26.330 --> 17:28.960
Well, they didn't have any
of my grandpa's guac.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.620
So did they really win?

17:30.620 --> 17:32.380
Just wave the white flag.

17:33.500 --> 17:37.540
Son, no one
is giving up today.

17:37.540 --> 17:41.210
We still have one last
guacamole balloon.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.790
Now, their drones
may be quicker,

17:43.790 --> 17:46.960
they may not be bogged down
with stamina issues,

17:46.960 --> 17:48.620
or arthritic knees,

17:48.620 --> 17:50.710
or sudden onset vertigo,

17:50.710 --> 17:53.790
but we have something
they will never have.

17:53.790 --> 17:56.250
Too much information
about your health?

17:57.420 --> 17:59.250
We're a family.

17:59.250 --> 18:02.120
And families
don't ever let anyone quit.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.830
They rally.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.750
Now hand me that remote.

18:05.750 --> 18:06.880
Go, Grandpa!

18:06.880 --> 18:09.420
-Guac attack.
-Go get 'em.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.380
(kids cheering)

18:20.960 --> 18:22.380
Uh, guys.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.330
Why is it coming
right for us?

18:24.330 --> 18:26.790
Hey. Hey, hey, Grandpa.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.750
Turn it around.
You're losing control.

18:28.750 --> 18:31.120
I'm trying. I don't
just have arthritic knees.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.880
My thumbs
are pretty bad too.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.330
Here it comes.
Everybody take cover.

18:36.330 --> 18:37.790
Oh no! My vision.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.210
(screams)

18:44.210 --> 18:45.500
(all gasping)

18:47.380 --> 18:49.500
Hey. I got tea
downs--

18:50.580 --> 18:52.170
What's going on?

18:52.960 --> 18:56.880
This is worse than
when the elephant
hosed me down.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.620
It's like I'm
at the circus.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.170
-I can't go back.
-No, no, no.

19:02.170 --> 19:03.750
-I can't.
-Andrea, this isn't--

19:03.750 --> 19:04.790
-I won't.
-No, no, no.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.170
-It's okay.
-No!

19:10.790 --> 19:12.040
Do you know
who that was?

19:13.330 --> 19:16.500
That was...
the only person I found...

19:16.500 --> 19:18.580
who was gonna be
my assistant

19:18.580 --> 19:20.750
and work for free.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.620
Mom, I'm sorry
we ruined--

19:24.620 --> 19:25.710
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.670
Don't even worry about it.
You know what? Just--

19:27.670 --> 19:29.540
Just stay on this roof
and play your little games

19:29.540 --> 19:31.460
instead of doing
what I asked you to do.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.620
I'm never gonna ask you
to do anything else.
You know what?

19:35.620 --> 19:37.460
I am waving the white flag.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.710
-Yes!
-We win!

19:39.710 --> 19:40.790
(cheering)

19:49.540 --> 19:51.420
We really did it
this time, guys.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.080
Yep.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.290
Hey, guys.
I think I have a way
to make this right for Mom.

19:56.290 --> 19:58.080
I do too.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.000
Wow.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.620
Who did you get to come
in here and clean--

20:06.620 --> 20:08.170
Me, Dad. Me.

20:08.170 --> 20:09.710
Me, I did it.
You know why?

20:09.710 --> 20:11.000
'Cause if I want
something done right,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.710
I'm gonna have to
do it myself.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.170
You know...

20:15.500 --> 20:17.420
It's not enough that I'm trying
to start my own business

20:17.420 --> 20:18.620
and keep up with Scut,

20:18.620 --> 20:20.380
but I also have to raise
two kids,

20:20.380 --> 20:21.500
and I got another one on loan.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.920
And knock, knock,
surprise!

20:22.920 --> 20:24.750
Who is it?
I got a fourth.

20:24.750 --> 20:28.420
Okay. I deserve that.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.500
My bad, Dad.
My bad, Dad.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.830
I just feel like I'm always
juggling stuff,

20:32.830 --> 20:34.500
trying to make it work,
you know?

20:34.500 --> 20:37.620
Andrea's worried about
working for a circus.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.580
My life is a circus.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.460
I get it.

20:41.460 --> 20:43.380
When I first opened
the Chill Grill,

20:43.380 --> 20:44.830
I was raising a family,

20:44.830 --> 20:47.040
and I was juggling
everything too.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.920
I'm still dropping balls.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.170
Well it seemed like
you always made it work.

20:52.170 --> 20:54.620
Maybe that's how
it looked to you, but...

20:55.790 --> 20:57.040
I'm still dropping everything.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.620
I came out here
to help you

20:58.620 --> 20:59.790
and I can't even
get that right.

20:59.790 --> 21:01.420
You don't have
to apologize, Dad.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.380
I'm not apologizing.

21:06.330 --> 21:09.290
Rae, the point is...

21:09.290 --> 21:11.330
No parents are perfect.

21:11.330 --> 21:12.540
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

21:12.540 --> 21:13.750
And, ha-ha!

21:13.750 --> 21:15.580
No kids are perfect.

21:15.580 --> 21:17.120
Don't be so hard
on them.

21:18.330 --> 21:20.880
And besides, Chelsea
just left this morning.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.620
This morning?
Feels like a month.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.540
Give the kids some time.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.920
And then, give yourself
some time.

21:33.210 --> 21:36.040
Don't wave
the white flag just yet.

21:38.210 --> 21:40.120
You're right, Dad.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.210
I won't.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.710
Thank you.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.040
-I love you.
-I love you too, baby.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.210
Hey, Mom.

21:50.790 --> 21:53.000
What do you three want?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.170
We just wanted to say
we know we really messed up.

21:56.170 --> 21:57.790
Yeah.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.380
We were selfish.

21:59.380 --> 22:02.120
So, if you still
have that list,

22:02.120 --> 22:04.500
we'd really like
to do those chores.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.710
For real this time.

22:07.830 --> 22:09.210
That would be helpful.

22:09.210 --> 22:10.960
-Thank you.
-Of course.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.710
And we know
you think you lost out

22:12.710 --> 22:14.290
on finding
that perfect assistant,

22:14.290 --> 22:17.170
but we might have found you
an even better one.

22:17.170 --> 22:20.380
All right, come on in.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.380
(nervous chuckle)

22:27.290 --> 22:28.380
Come on.
Remember?

22:29.540 --> 22:31.380
(gasps)
Raven.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.790
Sebastian, tell my mom
about the master's program

22:34.790 --> 22:37.080
you're in at
The Chicago Fashion Institute.

22:37.080 --> 22:42.750
(stammering)
I market clothes good.

22:44.710 --> 22:45.750
Okay, kids, come here.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.120
Let me talk to you.
Come here.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.620
Um, he can't even
complete a sentence.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.290
I appreciate the help
but thank you, no.

22:51.290 --> 22:52.960
Mom. Mom,
please just read, okay?

22:52.960 --> 22:54.620
Look at his notebook.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.500
He has a whole plan
on how to launch
an upstart fashion company.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.960
You did this?

23:02.960 --> 23:04.960
(stammering)
I market clothes good.

23:06.710 --> 23:10.000
Okay, listen. You look
really good on paper,
but in person...

23:10.000 --> 23:12.380
-Work free.
-You're hired.
Welcome to Ravenous.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.420
-I got the job?
-Unpaid.

23:15.420 --> 23:16.710
I'm working
for Raven Baxter.

23:16.710 --> 23:18.710
-For free.
-(screaming)

23:18.710 --> 23:20.710
I can't wait to get started.

23:20.710 --> 23:22.960
I'm thinking photo shoot.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.790
I'm gonna make you
huge on QuikSnap

23:24.790 --> 23:26.250
and we're gonna
monetize those posts.

23:26.250 --> 23:28.580
(gasps)
Do you have
a business plan?

23:28.580 --> 23:30.120
Never mind.
I have one.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.880
Let's sync our calendars

23:31.880 --> 23:34.710
so I can start scheduling
meetings with investors.

23:34.710 --> 23:37.750
Then interviews,
then... Oprah.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.790
-(gasping)
-(giggling)

23:40.790 --> 23:42.500
I'm so excited.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.380
Ooh, I need some
bubbly water.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.250
Why is there a kiddie pool
full of wet clothes in here?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.830
Never mind.
I'll clean it up.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.120
Kids: We got it.
