WEBVTT

00:07.807 --> 00:10.776
Regeneration phase completed.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.108
Deactivate the genotron.

00:18.451 --> 00:20.043
Shut down the bio-matrix.

00:22.889 --> 00:25.187
B'Elanna...

00:25.258 --> 00:27.988
B'Elanna Torres.

00:28.061 --> 00:30.359
Wake up.

02:20.573 --> 02:24.441
Captain's Log, Stardate 48784.2.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.173
We have completed our survey
of the Avery system

02:27.247 --> 02:28.544
and are returning to retrieve

02:28.615 --> 02:30.981
Lieutenants Paris,
Torres and Durst.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.314
By now, they should have
concluded their inspection

02:33.386 --> 02:36.355
of the magnesite formations
on the third planet.

02:36.422 --> 02:40.483
Here we are, Mr. Tuvok.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.997
One bowl of authentic
Vulcan plomeek soup.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.089
As l have told you, Mr. Neelix,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.828
this is
an unnecessary indulgence.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.426
l am quite content to eat

02:50.503 --> 02:51.970
whatever the rest of the crew
is eating.

02:52.038 --> 02:53.005
Nonsense!

02:53.072 --> 02:54.403
Everyone aboard this ship

02:54.474 --> 02:57.841
deserves a little taste of home
every now and then.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.378
Very well, then.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.776
Thank you.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.712
Oh, don't thank me.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.147
l'm having a marvelous time

03:04.217 --> 03:05.479
experimenting
with the native dishes

03:05.552 --> 03:06.746
of the entire crew.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.346
So far, l've learned to make
corn salad for Mr. Chakotay

03:10.423 --> 03:12.687
and peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

03:12.759 --> 03:14.158
for Mr. Paris.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.320
He calls it ''comfort food.''

03:16.396 --> 03:17.727
lsn't that charming?

03:19.232 --> 03:21.166
What are you waiting for?
lt's no good cold.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.974
Well?

03:30.476 --> 03:32.501
lt is rather... piquant.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.444
lt is zesty, isn't it?

03:34.514 --> 03:37.779
l tried following the recipe
in the computer's data bank,

03:37.850 --> 03:39.408
but it seemed so bland.

03:39.485 --> 03:42.283
So l took the liberty
of spicing it up a bit.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.256
Call it plomeek soup
o la Neelix.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.520
l must point out
that if you take the liberty

03:47.594 --> 03:49.994
of changing
a time-honored recipe,

03:50.063 --> 03:52.725
you are hardly presenting
a taste of home.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.962
Senior officers,
please report to the Bridge.

03:56.035 --> 03:57.161
But your soup.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.704
Please...

03:58.771 --> 04:00.170
enjoy it.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.817
Oh!

04:13.886 --> 04:15.854
Ooh, there's no place like home.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.747
The away team hasn't arrived

04:18.825 --> 04:20.452
at the prearranged coordinates,
Captain,

04:20.526 --> 04:22.653
and they've failed
to respond to our hails.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.027
Have you tried locking on
to their com signals?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.929
We scanned the entire surface.
No sign of them.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.058
They must still be underground.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.396
But l can't locate them
there, either.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.370
Then, as we suspected,
the dense magnesite formations

04:32.438 --> 04:35.566
in the planet's crust
are blocking our sensors.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.075
Take a look at this.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.974
This is the cave system
nearest the beam-in coordinates

04:39.045 --> 04:40.945
as it appeared in our
initial geological scan

04:41.014 --> 04:42.777
and this is
the same system now.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.111
This tunnel here

04:44.183 --> 04:46.413
has shifted to the west
by almost 7 5 degrees.

04:46.486 --> 04:49.148
Are you saying walls
of solid rock have changed shape

04:49.222 --> 04:51.315
in the two days since
the away team was deployed?

04:51.391 --> 04:53.359
Apparently so, Captain,
but our initial scans

04:53.426 --> 04:55.223
didn't indicate
tectonic activity

04:55.295 --> 04:56.990
of anywhere near that magnitude.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.258
ln any case, it's possible
that Torres and the others

04:59.332 --> 05:01.857
haven't returned to the beam-out
site because they were trapped

05:01.934 --> 05:03.765
by these geological shifts.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.361
l'd like to lead a team
down to investigate, Captain.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.067
And what is to prevent us from
losing you as well, Commander?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.234
Bread crumbs.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.299
Ensign?

05:11.377 --> 05:12.844
Oh, l'm sorry, Captain.

05:12.912 --> 05:16.245
What l mean to say is
l think l can modify

05:16.316 --> 05:18.443
some subspace transponders
which could be deployed

05:18.518 --> 05:20.008
along the Commander's path,
kind of like...

05:20.086 --> 05:21.917
Bread crumbs.
Got it.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.455
lf they're placed
at regular intervals,

05:23.523 --> 05:25.286
l believe they'll maintain
a signal link with the ship

05:25.358 --> 05:27.519
and they could serve
as a transporter relay

05:27.593 --> 05:29.618
in case we need to stage
an emergency beam-out.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.060
Very well, Commander.

05:33.132 --> 05:35.191
Take a team with you,
but l want a transporter lock

05:35.268 --> 05:36.599
on you at all times.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.636
Aye, Captain.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.638
Tuvok, Kim, you're with me.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.912
l apologize
for the restraints,

05:53.986 --> 05:56.750
but your presence here
is very important to us.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.882
Do you understand?

05:58.958 --> 06:02.155
Who... are... you?

06:02.228 --> 06:08.030
l am Sulan, Chief Surgeon
of the Vidiian Sodality.

06:08.101 --> 06:14.472
l demand... to know...

06:14.540 --> 06:17.566
what is happening here.

06:23.983 --> 06:27.919
You've surgically altered
my face!

06:28.020 --> 06:31.012
l look like a Klingon!

06:31.090 --> 06:34.423
l've performed no surgery,
as you understand the term.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.725
There are several questions
l need to ask you

06:37.797 --> 06:39.389
before we proceed.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.059
You can't possibly believe

06:42.135 --> 06:44.933
l'm going to cooperate
with you.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.494
Perhaps l was in error

06:46.572 --> 06:49.700
to leave your consciousness
and memory intact.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.802
Durst...

06:52.879 --> 06:55.143
Paris...

06:55.214 --> 06:58.308
What have you done with them?!

06:58.384 --> 07:00.875
What is your exact age,
Klingon?

07:00.953 --> 07:05.822
lf you want me
to answer your question,

07:05.892 --> 07:09.760
you will have to answer
one of mine first.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.456
Very well.

07:11.531 --> 07:18.061
What... exactly...
have you done to me?

07:18.137 --> 07:20.605
l have reconstituted
your genome.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.903
You are now purely Klingon.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.875
That's not possible!

07:25.044 --> 07:27.512
l assure you it is.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.778
l have developed a procedure
to stimulate cell division.

07:31.851 --> 07:35.480
A kind of... enhanced mitosis.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.888
Your Klingon genetic material
was extracted.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.394
lt was then converted
from matter to energy

07:42.462 --> 07:43.724
by our genotron.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.525
Finally...

07:45.598 --> 07:47.589
you were rematerialized

07:47.667 --> 07:50.534
as the purified
Klingon specimen

07:50.603 --> 07:52.161
that you are now.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.763
Why? Why...

07:54.841 --> 07:56.308
have you done this?!

07:56.375 --> 07:59.071
For generations,
my people have been searching

07:59.145 --> 08:02.114
the Quadrant
for a species immune

08:02.181 --> 08:05.617
to our disease, in the hope
that it would lead us to a cure.

08:05.685 --> 08:11.555
And you think Klingons
are immune to this phage?

08:11.624 --> 08:12.682
l believe your genetic structure

08:12.758 --> 08:16.250
has phage-resistant
nucleotide sequences, yes.

08:16.329 --> 08:21.460
But l needed a pure specimen
to be certain.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.230
My people do not know it yet,

08:24.303 --> 08:27.067
but you are their greatest hope.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.801
l... will... never

08:29.876 --> 08:31.434
help you!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.910
You are very strong.

08:33.980 --> 08:38.576
l can only hope that you will be
truly resistant to the phage.

08:38.650 --> 08:42.746
And how will you know that?

08:42.822 --> 08:46.121
l have infected you.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.415
They're the ones
with the guns, remember?

09:32.705 --> 09:34.468
We've got to find a way
out of this place.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.270
Agreed, but l don't want
to do anything

09:37.343 --> 09:39.174
until we find out what
they've done with B'Elanna.

09:43.783 --> 09:47.549
ln the meantime, we have to keep
track of the guards' movements--

09:47.620 --> 09:49.053
how long are their shifts

09:49.121 --> 09:51.248
when do they eat,
when do they sleep.

09:54.627 --> 09:57.391
There don't seem
to be many of them.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.431
l guess they figure
we're all so exhausted,

09:59.498 --> 10:01.329
we don't have any fight left.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.231
We'll find an opening, Pete,

10:03.302 --> 10:06.237
and when the time is right,
we'll make our move.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.340
Something funny, friend?

10:10.409 --> 10:11.808
You.

10:11.877 --> 10:12.969
Really?

10:13.045 --> 10:14.171
How's that?

10:14.246 --> 10:16.271
Nobody ever escapes
from this place.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.782
Those Vidiian leeches

10:17.850 --> 10:20.876
can yank the beating heart
out of you-- in a heartbeat.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.217
Heart out of you
in a heartbeat.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.916
Now, that's funny.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.390
Hilarious.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.086
Seems like you know this place
pretty well.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.492
l should.
l've been here six years.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.361
Then tell me something...

10:33.432 --> 10:34.364
l thought those Vidiians

10:34.433 --> 10:36.993
were in the business
of harvesting organs.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.468
How come we're all
still in one piece?

10:38.537 --> 10:40.505
The disease makes them weak.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.473
They need somebody
to dig their tunnels.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.304
That's us.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.277
Best way to keep alive
around here

10:46.345 --> 10:48.370
is to stay strong.

10:49.415 --> 10:50.404
Thanks for the advice.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.677
But don't worry.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.878
They're always in need
of replacement body parts.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.148
They'll get around
to gutting you eventually.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.350
There were 23 of us
from my ship.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.586
l'm the only one left.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.856
Listen, when they grabbed us,

11:03.929 --> 11:07.330
there was a woman with us--
B'Elanna Torres.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.731
Any idea what might've
happened to her?

11:08.801 --> 11:10.200
lf she's not here,

11:10.269 --> 11:12.396
she's been taken
to organ processing.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.899
l've deployed
the transponders, Commander.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.703
The relay signal
is coming through clearly.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.073
Good work.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.375
Any sign of them?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.785
According
to my tricorder readings,

12:02.855 --> 12:04.720
they definitely
came this way.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.987
The question is: Where
did they go from here?

12:13.132 --> 12:15.930
Delightful spot to get lost.

12:16.035 --> 12:18.833
Commander, Ensign, over here.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.407
What is it?

12:25.478 --> 12:27.946
l detect traces of at least
five humanoid life-forms.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.547
Five?

12:29.615 --> 12:31.913
There were only three
on the away team.

12:31.984 --> 12:34.646
Evidently, they did not enter
this cavern alone.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.538
Are you in pain?

13:04.350 --> 13:06.944
lt's... nothing.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.655
Remarkable.

13:10.723 --> 13:14.716
One of the symptoms
of the early stages of the phage

13:14.794 --> 13:17.922
is excruciating joint pain.

13:18.030 --> 13:21.932
l find it extraordinary
that you can endure it.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.026
Some who are infected

13:24.103 --> 13:27.834
have been known to die
from the agony itself.

13:29.475 --> 13:34.037
lt's going to take more
than an infection to kill me.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.578
lt appears you are correct.

13:41.654 --> 13:46.114
Your body is successfully
fighting off the phage.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.160
l am overjoyed.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.989
How delightful for you.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.894
Soon we will begin
a series of procedures

13:53.966 --> 13:57.595
replicating your genetic code
and attempting various methods

13:57.670 --> 14:00.195
of integrating your DNA
with our own.

14:00.272 --> 14:03.207
ln time, we'll be successful

14:03.275 --> 14:07.143
and eliminate the phage forever.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.909
When that time comes,

14:09.982 --> 14:13.247
you will be honored
as a hero by my people.

14:13.319 --> 14:17.380
l know l'm the first Klingon
you've ever seen,

14:17.456 --> 14:19.890
so l'll tell you

14:19.959 --> 14:26.728
that Klingons find honor
as warriors on the battlefield,

14:26.799 --> 14:31.395
not as guinea pigs
in a laboratory.

14:31.470 --> 14:35.406
Earlier, you accused me
of mutilating you.

14:35.474 --> 14:38.875
Now you sound positively proud
to be Klingon.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.776
You have me to thank
for that, B'Elanna.

14:43.849 --> 14:45.976
You'll get no gratitude from me.

14:46.051 --> 14:49.885
Perhaps you'll feel
different in time.

14:49.955 --> 14:53.391
But l don't blame you
for your obstinance.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.222
l would be proud, too,

14:55.294 --> 14:58.161
with a form as handsome
as yours.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.393
l believe Klingons

15:01.467 --> 15:06.097
are the most impressive species
l have ever seen.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.660
Tom...

15:40.139 --> 15:41.106
Tom, wake up.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.812
B'Elanna?

15:48.881 --> 15:52.112
Yeah. lt's me.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.086
B'Elanna, what have they
done to you?

16:08.400 --> 16:11.301
l remember them grabbing
us outside the caves

16:11.370 --> 16:13.304
and then l...

16:13.372 --> 16:15.670
l guess l just blacked out.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.642
Yeah.
They stunned all of us.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.474
The next thing l knew,

16:20.546 --> 16:24.642
they were waking me up in
some kind of laboratory.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.585
l was so groggy l couldn't see.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.748
l asked them
what they had done to me

16:31.824 --> 16:35.453
and then one of them said

16:35.527 --> 16:40.931
that they had completely
extracted my Klingon DNA.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.935
That doesn't seem possible...

16:46.005 --> 16:48.439
but you look human.

16:48.507 --> 16:53.206
l feel so weak
and sick to my stomach.

16:53.278 --> 16:54.973
Well, considering
what they've done to you,

16:55.047 --> 16:56.071
l'm not surprised.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.651
So strange.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.247
What?

17:06.325 --> 17:09.852
When l was a child,

17:09.962 --> 17:14.330
l did everything l could
to hide my forehead--

17:14.400 --> 17:17.425
hats, scarves-- you name it.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.569
When l was a kid,

17:20.638 --> 17:22.106
l wore a cap
to cover the haircuts

17:22.174 --> 17:26.234
my father used to make me get,
first day of every summer.

17:31.316 --> 17:35.047
l grew up in a colony
on Kessik lV.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.384
My mother and l were
the only Klingons there,

17:37.456 --> 17:39.390
and that was a time

17:39.458 --> 17:42.586
when relations
between the Homeworld

17:42.661 --> 17:46.097
and the Federation
weren't too cordial.

17:46.165 --> 17:50.829
Nobody ever said anything,
but...

17:50.903 --> 17:53.633
we were different...

17:53.705 --> 17:55.673
and l didn't like that feeling.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.238
Then...

18:00.312 --> 18:03.839
my father left...

18:03.916 --> 18:06.714
when l was five years old.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.347
One day he was there,
and the next, he wasn't.

18:11.423 --> 18:15.223
l cried myself to sleep
every night

18:15.294 --> 18:17.353
for months...

18:17.429 --> 18:20.398
but of course,
l never told anybody.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.728
And then l finally decided

18:25.804 --> 18:29.831
that he left because
l looked like a Klingon...

18:32.444 --> 18:34.571
and so l tried to look human.

18:39.251 --> 18:42.118
Looks like you finally got
what you wanted.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.132
Strange.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.301
What is?

19:05.377 --> 19:07.607
According to our last
geological scan,

19:07.679 --> 19:09.044
this cave should continue
straight ahead

19:09.114 --> 19:10.376
for another eight kilometers.

19:10.449 --> 19:13.009
This is solid granite,
more than 50 meters.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.950
lf these caves were
changing configuration

19:15.020 --> 19:17.011
while we were here,
we certainly would've felt it.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.319
True, Commander,
but l do not believe

19:19.391 --> 19:21.154
there has been
any tectonic activity.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.592
l believe this wall is
merely an illusion--

19:23.662 --> 19:26.859
a disguised force field.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.229
Away team to Voyager.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.494
Go ahead, Commander.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.036
We've run into some type
of force field, Captain.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.594
One minute, we were
reading an empty tunnel,

19:33.672 --> 19:34.798
and the next, we walked

19:34.873 --> 19:36.636
right into a solid wall of rock.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.642
Captain, the energy
configuration

19:38.710 --> 19:41.042
of the force field matrix
is virtually identical

19:41.113 --> 19:42.580
to those used by the Vidiians.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.372
Mr. Ayala...

19:45.450 --> 19:47.884
scan for any alien
vessels in the sector.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.648
Commander, we know
from past experience

19:49.721 --> 19:51.746
that our phasers
can disrupt that force field.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.347
l want to find out
what's in there.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.483
Aye, Captain.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.051
But l don't want you
taking any unnecessary risks.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.188
We'll be standing by to
implement an emergency beam-out.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.595
Acknowledged.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.503
lt's not working, Captain.

20:08.574 --> 20:09.666
Try reconfiguring your phaser

20:09.741 --> 20:11.868
to match the bandwidth
modulation.

20:11.944 --> 20:12.911
Commander!

20:14.713 --> 20:15.805
Three to beam up!

20:37.769 --> 20:39.430
B'Elanna.

20:44.543 --> 20:48.172
How are you feeling today?

20:48.247 --> 20:51.011
l feel strong.

20:51.083 --> 20:55.144
lt's very frustrating
to be restrained like this.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.653
l sympathize.

20:56.722 --> 21:01.125
l don't like being
chained up like an animal.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.058
l'm sorry.
l wish there was...

21:03.128 --> 21:05.756
l've been thinking about
what you've said.

21:05.831 --> 21:11.736
lt's because of you
that l am Klingon.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.930
And l do...

21:14.039 --> 21:15.870
like...

21:15.941 --> 21:17.602
this feeling.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.267
ln a strange way,

21:20.345 --> 21:22.870
l suppose...

21:22.948 --> 21:24.745
l am grateful.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.750
Did you know

21:26.818 --> 21:30.777
that Klingon females are
renowned in the Alpha Quadrant

21:30.856 --> 21:34.758
not only
for their physical prowess,

21:34.826 --> 21:36.760
but for their...

21:36.828 --> 21:42.994
voracious...
sexual appetites as well?

21:43.068 --> 21:47.198
Why not let your creation
out of her harness?

21:47.272 --> 21:51.470
Study her in action.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.342
l wish it were possible,
B'Elanna...

22:00.952 --> 22:07.118
but l'm afraid l can't risk
releasing you just yet.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.400
Forgive me.

22:18.470 --> 22:19.767
For what?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.669
Please...

22:21.740 --> 22:24.436
don't condescend.

22:24.509 --> 22:28.468
l may have
a grotesque appearance,

22:28.547 --> 22:33.575
but l assure you
my instincts are finely honed,

22:33.652 --> 22:36.382
and l do have feelings.

22:40.926 --> 22:45.363
Hard as it may be
for you to imagine, B'Elanna,

22:45.430 --> 22:51.528
my people were once handsome
and vigorous like yours.

22:51.603 --> 22:56.631
And with your help,
we will be again.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.834
Perhaps, when that time comes...

22:59.878 --> 23:04.611
l will not disgust you
quite so much as l do now.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.458
They're coming to take us
to the work detail.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.020
You can't let them see
how sick you are.

23:20.098 --> 23:21.395
Maybe if they
think l'm too weak,

23:21.466 --> 23:22.728
they'll leave me behind.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.928
l could try to get my hands
on that console over there.

23:25.036 --> 23:26.526
Or maybe they'll skip
the preliminaries

23:26.605 --> 23:28.664
and take you straight
to organ processing.

23:35.881 --> 23:36.870
You.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.245
Come with me.

23:38.316 --> 23:39.442
What for?

23:39.518 --> 23:41.418
You asked to contact your ship.

23:41.486 --> 23:43.977
The Prefect wishes
to discuss your request.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.819
l'm the senior officer here.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.452
lf your superiors want to talk
with one of us, it should be me.

23:50.562 --> 23:52.462
He's not going
anywhere without me!

23:52.531 --> 23:53.463
Tom, don't.

23:53.532 --> 23:54.658
They'll kill you.

23:54.733 --> 23:55.700
Stop!

23:56.668 --> 23:59.569
lt's okay, Tom.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.663
They're the ones
with the guns, remember?

24:16.922 --> 24:19.015
What is it?

24:25.964 --> 24:27.659
Now that the Vidiians
know we're here,

24:27.732 --> 24:29.290
we have to be prepared
for the possibility

24:29.367 --> 24:31.665
that they'll call in
reinforcements.

24:31.736 --> 24:32.828
So far, long-range sensors

24:32.904 --> 24:34.929
haven't located
any alien vessels near here.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.270
However, it is possible
that the same technology

24:37.342 --> 24:38.502
that disguises
their force fields,

24:38.577 --> 24:39.976
cloaks their ships.

24:40.078 --> 24:41.978
The other thing
we have to consider

24:42.080 --> 24:44.275
is that the prisoners
may be at greater risk now.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.840
Captain, take a look at this.

24:46.918 --> 24:48.215
Using our tricorder data,

24:48.286 --> 24:49.651
l've been able
to scan the entire planet

24:49.721 --> 24:50.983
for the force field signature,

24:51.056 --> 24:52.546
and it looks like
the field surrounds an area

24:52.624 --> 24:54.353
more than 600 kilometers
in circumference.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.485
ls there any way
to scan inside it?

24:56.561 --> 24:59.428
Every reconfiguration
l've tried has failed.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.022
lf it's the same kind
of force field

25:01.132 --> 25:03.327
the Vidiians used
the last time we ran into them,

25:03.368 --> 25:05.359
why didn't our phasers
breach it?

25:05.437 --> 25:08.565
Apparently, it has been adapted
to repulse phaser fire.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.609
lf the Vidiians can move in
and out of there, so can we.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.166
Start setting up simulations.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.440
Find a way to get through
that force field.

25:22.053 --> 25:24.180
B'Elanna?

25:26.758 --> 25:29.989
l have something
l want to show you.

25:37.969 --> 25:39.937
Durst...

25:40.005 --> 25:41.404
l thought perhaps this new face

25:41.473 --> 25:43.737
would make you
more comfortable with me.

25:43.808 --> 25:46.174
You've killed him.

25:46.244 --> 25:47.506
Yes, B'Elanna,

25:47.579 --> 25:51.242
but his organs will save
more than a dozen lives.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.303
Deep-level scans have revealed
a network of microfissures,

26:16.374 --> 26:17.807
minuscule openings
which develop briefly

26:17.876 --> 26:20.310
each time the field
matrix remodulates.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.505
Just how small are
these microfissures?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.742
Less than one micron.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.875
And they close up
within a few seconds.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.886
Would it be possible
to use our phasers

26:28.954 --> 26:31.252
to expand one of these
openings as it's forming?

26:31.323 --> 26:32.881
That was our first thought.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.586
But we realized such an attempt
would have to be at close range

26:35.660 --> 26:36.854
and would carry the risk

26:36.928 --> 26:39.260
of alerting the Vidiians
to our presence.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.491
So then it occurred to us--

26:40.565 --> 26:42.192
if we could narrow
the transporter's energy beam

26:42.267 --> 26:44.167
tightly enough,
it might be possible

26:44.235 --> 26:47.204
to transport one of us
through the microfissures.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.933
Of course, timing the transport

26:49.074 --> 26:51.770
to the precise moment
of an opening would be critical.

26:51.843 --> 26:53.902
But if we could
get someone inside,

26:53.979 --> 26:55.606
we might be able
to find our people

26:55.680 --> 26:58.080
and also deactivate
the force field.

26:58.149 --> 26:59.343
And then, presumably,

26:59.417 --> 27:01.146
we could beam everyone
back to the ship.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.514
Precisely.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.852
But you should be aware
that because we are incapable

27:04.956 --> 27:06.423
of scanning beyond
the force field,

27:06.491 --> 27:08.118
we will have no way
of communicating

27:08.193 --> 27:10.093
with whoever
transports inside it,

27:10.161 --> 27:11.423
nor will we be able to verify

27:11.496 --> 27:13.657
that the transport
has been successfully completed.

27:13.732 --> 27:17.065
Moreover, what's to prevent
whoever goes in

27:17.135 --> 27:19.330
from being captured
by the Vidiians?

27:19.404 --> 27:21.895
l have an idea about that,
Captain.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.239
Dermal stimulator, please.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.716
Remarkable work, Doctor.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.179
lf you think this is remarkable,

27:34.252 --> 27:35.913
you should see me
remove a bunion.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.590
l have done my best
to replicate Vidiian attire.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.256
l trust it will prove
sufficiently convincing.

27:47.699 --> 27:50.429
lt's a fine piece
of work, Mr. Tuvok.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.596
Next time l need a tailor,
l'll know just where to look.

27:54.639 --> 27:55.936
Quickly now!

28:00.712 --> 28:02.179
ln there!

28:20.131 --> 28:22.292
Here, B'Elanna.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.459
Sit down.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.971
Here. lt's water.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.569
Thanks.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.045
Rest while you can.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.879
The guard won't be back
right away.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.618
Keep it.

28:51.496 --> 28:53.862
Tom...

28:53.932 --> 28:55.263
l've been thinking.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.705
When they did this thing to me,

29:00.772 --> 29:03.502
l think it changed more
than just the way l look.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.304
What do you mean?

29:08.880 --> 29:12.782
Back there,
when they took Durst away...

29:12.851 --> 29:14.978
l was...

29:15.053 --> 29:16.577
terrified.

29:16.654 --> 29:19.452
No one could blame you for that.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.958
You don't understand.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.994
l've been in worse situations,

29:24.062 --> 29:26.792
but l've never felt
like that before.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.355
Never.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.764
l mean...

29:29.834 --> 29:34.294
my heart was pounding
and my hands were shaking.

29:34.372 --> 29:36.840
l didn't even try to help you.

29:36.908 --> 29:38.239
B'Elanna, l'm no doctor,

29:38.309 --> 29:40.777
but l have to believe
that whatever they did to you

29:40.845 --> 29:42.779
has seriously depleted
your strength.

29:42.847 --> 29:44.439
There's nothing
you could've done.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.178
No, that's not it.

29:47.252 --> 29:49.413
l think that...

29:49.487 --> 29:52.923
when they extracted
my Klingon DNA...

29:53.024 --> 29:55.322
they turned me
into some kind of...

29:57.529 --> 29:58.894
...a coward.

30:00.064 --> 30:03.522
Sometimes fear
can be a good thing.

30:03.601 --> 30:07.162
lt keeps you from taking
unnecessary chances.

30:07.238 --> 30:10.674
Courage doesn't mean
that you don't have fear.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.336
lt means that you've
learned to overcome it.

30:13.411 --> 30:16.437
And l know you can find
the courage to hold on

30:16.514 --> 30:19.381
until we can find a way
out of this place.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.714
What's going on here?

30:21.786 --> 30:23.720
She's ill.
She needed a rest.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.449
lf she's too weak, l'll take
her back to the barracks.

30:25.523 --> 30:26.512
That's okay, Tom.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.218
Maybe from there,

30:28.293 --> 30:29.817
l can try to make contact
with the ship.

30:38.102 --> 30:40.502
The emitter array has been
initialized, Captain.

30:40.572 --> 30:41.504
Good.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.200
Are you ready, Mr. Chakotay?

30:45.810 --> 30:48.370
Captain, there's an opening
forming in the force field.

30:48.446 --> 30:49.811
lnitiating auto sequence.

30:49.881 --> 30:51.508
Targeting scanners
to match coordinates.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.016
Scanners locked.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.779
On my mark, Mr. Kim.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.186
Energize.

31:03.761 --> 31:05.228
Well...

31:05.296 --> 31:06.695
now we wait.

31:17.976 --> 31:20.467
Make a sound
and l'll break your neck.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.342
Understand?

31:22.413 --> 31:25.746
l'm looking for my friend,
Tom Paris-- a human male.

31:25.817 --> 31:26.749
Have you seen him?

31:26.818 --> 31:27.978
He was here,

31:28.052 --> 31:29.542
but they sent him
to another tunnel.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.747
Which one?

31:30.822 --> 31:32.585
Back that way.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.090
There was another human
with him,

31:34.158 --> 31:36.991
but they took her
back to the barracks.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.585
A human female?

31:38.663 --> 31:39.891
Yeah...

31:52.110 --> 31:54.078
l need your help here.

32:40.725 --> 32:42.192
What are you doing?!

32:42.260 --> 32:44.194
Come with us.

32:44.262 --> 32:45.251
Where are you taking me?

32:45.330 --> 32:46.695
For a shower and a hot meal.

32:46.764 --> 32:48.095
No, please!

34:08.212 --> 34:09.440
Wake up, pahtk!

34:10.447 --> 34:11.880
Eat!

34:11.949 --> 34:15.214
What... what is it?

34:15.286 --> 34:17.277
Some rodent l killed.

34:19.924 --> 34:21.915
No. Thanks.

34:21.993 --> 34:25.257
l'm sorry l can't
replicate you a souffle,

34:25.329 --> 34:27.126
but you need nourishment.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.792
l can't carry you
all the way out of here.

34:40.043 --> 34:42.945
How are we supposed
to escape this place?

34:43.014 --> 34:44.708
There are guards everywhere.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.340
We fight our way out.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.748
Maybe you haven't noticed,

34:47.819 --> 34:50.686
but l'm not exactly
in fighting form.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.246
That's why you need food.
Eat!

34:59.530 --> 35:01.191
So...

35:01.299 --> 35:02.630
you're what's left over

35:02.667 --> 35:05.397
when all the Klingon DNA
is taken out.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.036
Apparently.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.077
lf l hadn't come along,

35:13.144 --> 35:16.011
were you just going to waste
away in that prison camp

35:16.080 --> 35:18.514
until they killed you
for your body parts?

35:18.583 --> 35:21.609
Were you too frightened to act?

35:21.686 --> 35:24.519
l was looking
for a way to escape.

35:24.589 --> 35:25.521
Looking!

35:25.590 --> 35:27.649
l'll show you the way to escape.

35:27.725 --> 35:30.023
This and this.

35:30.094 --> 35:32.654
That's the way you respond
to every situation, isn't it?

35:32.730 --> 35:34.288
lf it doesn't work, hit it.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.560
lf it's in your way,
knock it down.

35:37.935 --> 35:40.199
No wonder
l got kicked out of the Academy.

35:40.271 --> 35:44.071
For which you should be
eternally grateful.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.404
Well, l'm not.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.706
Your temper has gotten me into
trouble more times than l can...

35:50.181 --> 35:51.546
Listen to me.

35:57.522 --> 36:00.787
Listen to us.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.485
This is ridiculous.

36:02.560 --> 36:06.121
Do you realize that we're each
fighting with our self?

36:06.197 --> 36:08.995
l'm not the one
who's fighting, pahtk.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.693
lf l remember correctly,

36:10.768 --> 36:13.828
l'm the one who rescued you
from that prison

36:13.905 --> 36:16.032
and carried you here.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.075
Don't you think

36:18.142 --> 36:21.441
you could at least
acknowledge that?

36:21.512 --> 36:23.912
Can't you even admit

36:24.015 --> 36:26.347
that you won't be able
to get out of here without me?

36:27.518 --> 36:30.453
l don't know that l can
get out of here with you.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.920
Brute force
isn't going to do it.

36:31.989 --> 36:36.119
Maybe not!
Maybe we'll die in the attempt,

36:36.194 --> 36:37.786
but that's better
than sitting here

36:37.862 --> 36:39.887
like frightened Tika cats
doing nothing!

36:39.964 --> 36:42.797
There you go again--
out of control.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.926
Just leaping into action

36:45.036 --> 36:46.628
before you think things through.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.194
Fine! You stay here.
l'm getting out.

36:48.272 --> 36:49.204
No, wait a minute.

36:49.273 --> 36:50.205
That's not what l meant.

36:50.274 --> 36:51.241
l'm sorry.

36:52.577 --> 36:53.874
Please...

36:58.649 --> 37:01.049
Just before...

37:01.152 --> 37:02.449
you rescued me...

37:05.089 --> 37:07.751
l logged onto the
Vidiians' computer system.

37:07.825 --> 37:09.087
l only had a few seconds,

37:09.160 --> 37:12.459
but l think l found a way
to access the force field

37:12.530 --> 37:15.624
that's cloaking this place.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.498
With a few minutes more,
l could've deactivated it.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.060
Then Voyager
could get a lock on us.

37:21.138 --> 37:22.332
Beam us back.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.067
Paris, too.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.803
lt may not be as exciting

37:26.877 --> 37:29.402
as fighting our way out,

37:29.480 --> 37:32.472
but it stands a much
better chance of working

37:32.550 --> 37:36.509
if... l have your help.

37:38.656 --> 37:42.114
So... you need me.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.454
l can't get back
to that computer without you

37:48.532 --> 37:51.000
and you'll have to cover
for me while l work.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.632
We can't go
to the prison barracks.

37:55.706 --> 37:58.174
There are
too many guards there.

37:58.242 --> 38:00.107
ln the lab,
where they were holding me,

38:00.211 --> 38:02.441
there was a security console.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.108
That's the last place
they would expect us to be.

38:20.331 --> 38:23.630
They must have taken her
to organ processing.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.601
Tell me how to get there.

38:27.271 --> 38:28.602
Keep your hands off me!

38:28.673 --> 38:30.140
Whatever you say, Paris,

38:30.207 --> 38:32.539
but l thought you might like
to get out of this place.

38:35.212 --> 38:36.804
Chakotay?

38:36.881 --> 38:38.781
Where are Torres and Durst?

38:41.786 --> 38:42.844
l think they've been taken

38:42.920 --> 38:44.854
to what the Vidiians
call ''organ processing.''

38:44.922 --> 38:46.116
You!

38:46.190 --> 38:47.384
Why are you talking
to that prisoner?

38:47.458 --> 38:49.790
l was ordered to take him
to organ processing.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.623
Why wasn't l notified?

38:51.696 --> 38:52.993
l was told you had been.

38:54.365 --> 38:56.265
l've never seen you before.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.826
My face was just grafted.

39:03.474 --> 39:04.941
Very well.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.601
Take him, but from now on,

39:06.677 --> 39:10.135
l expect to be notified in
advance of all transfers.

39:10.214 --> 39:11.442
Yes, sir.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.452
There.

39:23.661 --> 39:26.027
l have to bypass
the security code,

39:26.097 --> 39:28.429
so l can access
the force field grid.

39:28.499 --> 39:33.402
Then l'll have a better idea
of what we're dealing with.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.863
That should do it.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.201
There.

39:39.276 --> 39:40.868
That's what we're up against,

39:41.011 --> 39:42.171
and l think we're...

39:42.246 --> 39:43.713
here.

39:43.781 --> 39:44.873
Can you shut it down?

39:45.015 --> 39:46.414
l'm working on it.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.276
What now?

39:50.287 --> 39:51.276
lf they didn't know

39:51.355 --> 39:52.788
we were here before,
they do now.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.522
Take it easy.

39:57.595 --> 39:58.823
l'll be done in a minute.

40:01.599 --> 40:05.160
You're not frightened
anymore, are you?

40:05.236 --> 40:07.204
Maybe l just don't have time
to think about it.

40:12.009 --> 40:12.907
Are you hurt?

40:12.977 --> 40:14.274
Keep working!

40:14.345 --> 40:15.403
B'Elanna!

40:15.479 --> 40:16.673
Stop.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.511
You're not going to hurt me.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.175
You need me.

40:21.252 --> 40:25.985
You're right,
but if you do not surrender,

40:26.056 --> 40:27.990
l will kill her.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.821
Drop it!

40:35.199 --> 40:36.894
Who are you?

40:36.967 --> 40:38.127
That's what l want to know!

40:38.202 --> 40:39.499
lt's Chakotay.

40:42.973 --> 40:45.567
l think l've just about accessed
the force field.

40:45.643 --> 40:46.974
Hurry!

40:49.346 --> 40:50.813
Got it!

40:50.881 --> 40:52.348
There.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.116
Captain, the force field
has been disrupted.

40:57.254 --> 41:00.087
Mr. Kim, can you get a lock
on Commander Chakotay?

41:00.157 --> 41:01.249
Chakotay to Voyager.
Do you read?

41:01.325 --> 41:03.316
Loud and clear, Commander.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.622
l found them, Captain.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.864
No!

41:09.834 --> 41:11.165
No!

41:11.235 --> 41:15.228
Three humans and one Klingon
to beam up.

41:24.615 --> 41:27.311
She's badly wounded, Captain.

41:27.384 --> 41:28.316
Beam her to Sick Bay!

41:28.385 --> 41:31.218
Don't. No time.

41:36.694 --> 41:39.629
You showed true courage.

41:39.697 --> 41:45.761
lt makes my death...
an honorable one.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.886
Using tissue
from your counterpart,

42:08.959 --> 42:11.519
l can replicate the Klingon DNA.

42:11.595 --> 42:13.028
Then, over the course
of several days,

42:13.097 --> 42:14.724
l'll reintegrate
that genetic material

42:14.798 --> 42:16.197
into your cellular structure.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.928
Wait a minute--
you're not saying

42:18.002 --> 42:19.435
that you're going
to change me back.

42:19.503 --> 42:21.164
That's precisely
what l'm saying.

42:22.406 --> 42:24.067
Your cells' ability
to synthesize proteins

42:24.141 --> 42:26.666
has been severely compromised.

42:26.744 --> 42:28.678
You need the Klingon
genes to survive.

42:32.883 --> 42:36.683
So, she's saving my life again.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.221
l'll get started on the DNA.

42:45.930 --> 42:48.364
How are you doing?

42:48.432 --> 42:51.367
l'm not sure.

42:51.435 --> 42:53.562
lt's been a pretty
strange experience.

42:53.637 --> 42:58.700
l do know that right now...

42:58.776 --> 43:02.769
the way l am...

43:02.880 --> 43:06.407
l'm more at peace with myself
than l've ever been before...

43:09.086 --> 43:11.680
...and that's a good feeling.

43:11.755 --> 43:14.280
But...?

43:14.358 --> 43:17.725
l'm incomplete.

43:19.663 --> 43:23.531
lt doesn't feel like me.

43:27.738 --> 43:30.605
l guess l've had someone else
living inside of me for too long

43:30.674 --> 43:32.642
to feel right without her.

43:32.710 --> 43:35.679
l'd have to say that you two
made quite a team down there.

43:38.148 --> 43:41.811
l know.

43:41.885 --> 43:46.549
l came to admire
a lot of things about her--

43:46.624 --> 43:49.457
her strength,

43:49.526 --> 43:51.494
her bravery...

43:58.836 --> 44:03.170
l guess... l just have
to accept the fact

44:03.273 --> 44:06.037
that l'll spend the rest
of my life fighting with her.
