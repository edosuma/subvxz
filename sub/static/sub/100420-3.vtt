WEBVTT

00:05.964 --> 00:07.841
[Diane]
The series is called "Crooshin' USA."

00:07.924 --> 00:08.925
[man] What does that mean?

00:09.009 --> 00:12.470
Crooshness is hard to define,
but I also don't know it when I see it.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.513
Oop. Pardon my reach.

00:13.596 --> 00:16.516
Well, I'm always trying to get more girls
interested in agriculture.

00:16.599 --> 00:21.062
You might say I've got my eyes on them.
Potato eyes, that is.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.022
-Guy?
-[Guy] Mm-hmm.

00:22.272 --> 00:26.735
Hey, girls! It's Diane,
outside Idaho's largest potato supplier,

00:26.818 --> 00:28.236
-Starch Farms.
-Hello!

00:28.319 --> 00:29.279
Let me get this straight.

00:29.362 --> 00:33.283
Your farm harvests five types of potatoes,
two types of onions,

00:33.366 --> 00:35.869
and is also a front
for a local sex trafficking ring?

00:35.952 --> 00:38.997
-[gasps]
-How'd you get started in sex trafficking?

00:39.164 --> 00:41.499
Uh...

00:41.583 --> 00:44.002
[panting]

00:44.085 --> 00:46.004
I don't think
I'm getting that microphone back.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.632
This is the second straight year
this Michigan resort's food

00:49.716 --> 00:52.135
has tested positive for avian botulism.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.428
Wow, two years in a row.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.638
It's like the Tom Hanks
of poisoning people.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.515
They said the jewelry is safe
for humans now,

00:57.599 --> 01:00.560
but I've been wearing this
for a week, and...

01:00.643 --> 01:01.478
[groans]

01:01.853 --> 01:03.938
Can we get more B-roll
so we have something to cut away to

01:04.022 --> 01:05.315
when I have to scratch my nose?

01:05.398 --> 01:08.151
I thought scratching your nose
was your way of saying hello to me.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.655
Don't you find it a little convenient
that the mayor has yet to restore

01:12.739 --> 01:14.115
clean drinking water to this part of--

01:14.199 --> 01:18.244
No, it's quite inconvenient.
You think this is convenient?

01:18.453 --> 01:21.831
The East Side is a lower-income area,
ergo the residents

01:21.915 --> 01:24.042
are not huge campaign donors, ergo--

01:24.125 --> 01:26.711
No, the mayor
didn't target that neighborhood,

01:26.795 --> 01:29.255
he was just that stupid
when it came to water filtration.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.175
He was just stupid enough to think
he wouldn't get caught, ergo--

01:32.258 --> 01:34.719
Say "ergo" one more time.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.679
-Ergo.
-Nah.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.014
-No, no, no, no.
-[Diane giggles]

01:38.306 --> 01:39.224
This is Diane Nguyen...

01:39.307 --> 01:40.433
This is Diane... This is Di...

01:40.517 --> 01:43.061
This is Diane Nguyen,
and that's the Croosh!

01:43.770 --> 01:45.063
-[Guy mumbles] Let me see.
-Did you hear

01:45.146 --> 01:46.356
about Philip Morris Disney Fox

01:46.439 --> 01:50.401
AT&amp;T AOL Time Warner PepsiCo
Haliburton Skynet Toyota Trader Joe's?

01:50.485 --> 01:52.403
-What about them?
-They got acquired by Whitewhale.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.406
Oh, shit.
Well, how many companies are there now?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.825
Four? [gasps]

01:56.908 --> 01:58.535
-What is it?
-I'm sorry, Diane.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.079
Look, I asked for two beds, I swear.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.707
-Huh.
-I mean, this is unprofessional. One bed!

02:04.791 --> 02:06.668
What are we supposed to do
with just one bed?

02:06.751 --> 02:08.128
Quite a pickle.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.381
I should march right back down
to that front desk and tell them--

02:11.464 --> 02:13.133
[both moaning]

02:13.216 --> 02:16.553
Thank you... [chuckles] for helping me
with my one bed bit.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.471
-[both moan]
-It's a good bit.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.557
[theme music playing]

03:14.068 --> 03:15.820
[BoJack's voice] Dear Diane, hello.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.363
-[Guy snores]
-This is a letter.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.782
Rehab is making me write a letter
to a friend

03:19.866 --> 03:21.868
because I guess letter writing
is therapeutic?

03:21.951 --> 03:24.245
I hear it did wonders
for the Zodiac killer.

03:24.579 --> 03:28.541
Anyway, rehab's going fine.
A lot of hikes and movie nights and yoga

03:28.958 --> 03:31.461
and I think next week
we're doing a color war.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.173
And it's good that I'm here,
and it's good that I'm not drinking

03:35.256 --> 03:38.218
or taking pills, but I keep thinking
about how this isn't real life.

03:38.301 --> 03:42.597
It's summer camp. Temporary. Easy.

03:42.931 --> 03:46.517
As nice as this is, I know that someday
I'll have to go back to the real world.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.811
Hey, Lady, listen, can you put him
on the phone, please?

03:48.895 --> 03:52.523
I don't care if he doesn't wanna
talk to me. I'm his father. No, Lady--

03:52.607 --> 03:53.608
[Guy groans angrily]

03:53.691 --> 03:55.193
[BoJack's voice] Anyway, that's my letter.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.863
I probably won't even send it,
but if you're reading this, I guess I did?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.907
Your friend, BoJack.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.534
P.S. Horseman.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.498
I'm only in Chicago for a week.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.125
I don't think it's selfish
to wanna see my son.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.127
Yeah, but you gotta give your ex notice.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.504
Whose side are you on?

04:14.587 --> 04:16.714
Uh... Hey, look out the window.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.633
[Guy] Wow, there she is!

04:18.716 --> 04:21.594
The second windy, muddy,
big-shoulders city by the lake.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.931
Look! Willis Tower.
Oh, and look, the new Whitewhale building!

04:25.014 --> 04:28.059
You cannot be excited
about a giant corporation like Whitewhale

04:28.142 --> 04:29.644
setting up shop in your hometown.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.396
I'm just excited
we got a new big building.

04:31.562 --> 04:34.190
-In your face, Dubai.
-[chuckles]

04:34.691 --> 04:37.402
[man gasps and pants]

04:38.695 --> 04:40.488
-Hmm...
-Ah...

04:40.571 --> 04:42.198
-Not bad.
-It's because the bread

04:42.282 --> 04:44.033
is made from lake water and lard.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.452
-[phone buzzes]
-From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.288
Today, your phone is ringing.

04:48.371 --> 04:53.751
Here's what you need to know about people
who still use their phone to call people.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.794
Hey, Stefani.

04:54.877 --> 04:55.712
Hey, girl!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.839
-No, no, it's Guy.
-[Stefani] Hey, Guy!

04:57.922 --> 05:01.009
I got you on speaker. Diane's eating
the best sandwich of her life.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.427
-It's okay.
-[Stefani exhales]

05:02.510 --> 05:05.221
Diane, I love
that you still eat sandwiches.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.433
Flaws like that are what make you
relatable to regular women.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.809
-[gulps] What?
-Meanwhile,

05:09.892 --> 05:13.646
I am adoring your cross-country exposition
of the ugly underbelly

05:13.730 --> 05:15.023
of American capitalism.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.065
So croosh.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.235
But I wonder if you could make room
in the rotation

05:19.319 --> 05:21.362
for a few feel-good stories?

05:21.446 --> 05:23.323
Stefani, our videos
are making a difference.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.575
Yeah, a difference in how bummed I am.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.119
There's gotta be some good news out there.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.954
-[sighs]
-We'll see what we can do!

05:30.038 --> 05:32.540
-Why'd you say yes?
-We can do feel-good stories.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.334
What about that girl who opened up
a lemonade stand

05:34.417 --> 05:35.793
to pay for her dad's cancer treatment?

05:35.877 --> 05:37.420
How is that a feel-good story?

05:37.503 --> 05:40.673
"Hey, America! We're the only developed
nation without subsidized healthcare,

05:40.757 --> 05:43.217
so this child joined
the workforce in a desperate bid

05:43.301 --> 05:44.469
to keep her father alive!"

05:44.552 --> 05:45.720
Okay. How 'bout this?

05:45.803 --> 05:47.972
Local cameraman has a pretty
good thing going,

05:48.056 --> 05:49.807
where he gets to travel
all over the country,

05:49.891 --> 05:53.227
and fool around in hotel rooms with
his beautiful, smart, feisty producer...

05:53.519 --> 05:56.189
and he's pretty sure
this passionate, intelligent,

05:56.272 --> 05:58.149
warrior for truth likes it, too,

05:58.316 --> 06:00.860
so maybe these two knuckleheads
should swallow their pride for a second

06:00.943 --> 06:02.737
and make some feel-good videos.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.495
Hey, girls.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.496
-Hey, Diane.
-Hey.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.082
Tell me
about the Every Animal Girl Company.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.751
We are two best friends
who got tired of seeing dolls

06:16.834 --> 06:19.420
promoting unrealistic beauty standards.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.421
Take Ginny here.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.383
Most giraffe dolls have necks
one inch shorter by scale

06:23.466 --> 06:24.592
than the average girl giraffe.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.676
Not our Ginny.

06:25.760 --> 06:30.014
Her neck is long and proud,
for all our necky gals out there.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.974
As a necky gal, I love that.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.936
And is it true that all your dolls
are made out of recycled material?

06:35.019 --> 06:36.604
-Uh... No.
-Yes!

06:36.687 --> 06:38.523
-Sorry?
-Well, traditionally...

06:38.606 --> 06:41.234
-[overlapping dialogue]
-The first batch, um...

06:41.692 --> 06:44.028
The important thing is
we're two best friends.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.279
Okay, what's going on?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.240
Uh... [giggles nervously]

06:47.323 --> 06:50.368
Okay. We are excited to announce
that as of today,

06:50.451 --> 06:54.288
the Every Animal Girl Company
has been purchased by Toys Galore,

06:54.372 --> 06:57.125
a subsidiary
of Whitewhale Consolidated Interests.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.794
Yay! Toys Galore!

06:59.961 --> 07:01.587
-Uh...
-Huh?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.005
"Yay..."

07:03.089 --> 07:06.884
A small, independent start-up
bought out by a huge conglomerate.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.929
It must be so empowering
to see your success grow.

07:10.012 --> 07:13.975
What a happy story for two best friends.
Now, about the recycled materials?

07:14.058 --> 07:17.687
Well, it's unclear what role recycling
will play in the future of this company.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.982
Right now, we're mainly focused
on empowering young girls,

07:21.065 --> 07:24.318
and closing the main Chicago factory
so we can relocate overseas

07:24.402 --> 07:25.611
for cheaper labor.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.988
Right before the holidays!

07:27.071 --> 07:29.031
[clears throat] Feel-good.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.743
[strained] What an exciting,
empowering time for you!

07:32.827 --> 07:34.412
I know.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.748
You think you can edit that down
into something feel-goody?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.959
For sure.
It'll have to go up late, though,

07:40.042 --> 07:42.545
because I'm having some friends over
to watch the game tonight.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.297
God, I'm freezing.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.550
-Aw.
-So, you, uh...

07:47.633 --> 07:50.636
-You wanna watch the game with us?
-Are you asking me to meet your friends?

07:50.720 --> 07:53.431
No, I just figure,
since you're staying with me anyway--

07:53.514 --> 07:56.684
I would be delighted. Wait, it's not
the Chicago Baby Humans game, is it?

07:56.767 --> 07:57.685
It's just a mascot.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.772
[reporter] And there goes Waa-Waa,
the Baby Human, stumbling around

08:01.856 --> 08:04.108
like the furless featherless dolt he is.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.904
What's he got there?
Don't drink that poison, you crazy human!

08:07.987 --> 08:10.990
-We don't drink poison.
-Diane, he's not a literal human.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.826
Waa-Waa is a tribute
to your proud human heritage.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.204
-I'm very flattered.
-Anyway, meet the gang.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.748
Everyone, this is Diane. My, um...

08:18.831 --> 08:21.125
Ah... You know, my--
The woman that I work with.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.502
-[all] Hi.
-[man] 'Sup, dude?

08:24.086 --> 08:25.463
-Hmm...
-You okay?

08:25.546 --> 08:27.924
Yeah. Sorry, just-- I'll be right back.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.968
[doorbell rings]

08:38.017 --> 08:40.061
[sighs]

08:40.144 --> 08:42.063
-Diane, I'm really sorry, but--
-It's fine.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.023
I wasn't expecting, ya know,
in front of your friends.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.900
-He just showed up.
-We haven't put a label on us.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.860
-I'm not looking for--
-The speech and debate tournament

08:47.944 --> 08:50.738
-was canceled on account of cyberbullying.
-Wait, what are you talking about?

08:50.821 --> 08:52.907
-My son is here. He surprised me.
-Oh, shit.

08:52.990 --> 08:56.244
I usually don't bring women around my kid
unless it's serious.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.662
-I get it.
-Do you mind staying at a hotel?

08:57.745 --> 08:59.789
-Oh, yeah. Totally.
-He'll be gone first thing tomorrow.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.457
What if he sees me go out?
Is the coast clear?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.584
-You should maybe go out the window.
-[grunts]

09:03.668 --> 09:05.670
This makes sense. But what about my stuff?

09:05.753 --> 09:07.088
I'll pack your bag
and throw it out to you.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.507
Okay, good. Bye.
Thank you for inviting me to your party.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.466
You have a lovely home.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.554
[BoJack's voice] Dear Diane, hello.
I am writing you another letter.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.641
Today sucks. There's this new lady here,
Beverly, and she took my snack kit.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.770
And that is so classic Beverly.
Probably. I just met her.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.731
The whole point of the snack kits
is they're communal, right?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.900
They're these bags full of snacks
that we take on our morning hikes,

09:27.984 --> 09:31.612
and we put them together the night before,
as like a team-building thing.

09:32.697 --> 09:36.033
Yesterday, I decided to throw an extra bag
of candied nuts into a snack kit,

09:36.117 --> 09:37.285
something just for me.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.494
And I marked my bag with a "B"

09:38.578 --> 09:39.954
so I'd know which one to grab
in the morning.

09:40.037 --> 09:40.955
"B" for "BoJack."

09:41.038 --> 09:42.748
-[groans angrily]
-But then today, I see Beverly,

09:42.832 --> 09:45.167
who, again, just got here,
waltzing around the house

09:45.251 --> 09:49.005
with my snack kit, saying, "Oh, somebody
made a special kit just for me!

09:49.297 --> 09:52.592
B for Beverly!
I must have a secret admirer!"

09:52.675 --> 09:54.343
Again, just got here!

09:54.427 --> 09:55.803
-[shivering]
-The story of my life

09:55.886 --> 09:57.388
is that I never get anything nice.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.849
You'd think that I'd learn to adjust
my expectations by now.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.517
But, no. Once again,

10:01.601 --> 10:04.604
I was the idiot
who got my hopes up about candied nuts

10:04.687 --> 10:08.983
and now I am disappointed
with no one to blame but myself.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.736
-[sighs]
-Anyway, what's new with you?

10:11.819 --> 10:14.614
[scoffs] Just kidding,
you can't say anything, this is a letter!

10:14.697 --> 10:17.116
Okay, talk soon. BoJack.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.165
-[crickets chirping]
-[phone buzzes]

10:24.248 --> 10:26.125
From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.251
Today, your--

10:27.335 --> 10:29.795
-Hello?
-[Stefani] Diane, your last video--

10:29.879 --> 10:32.340
Okay, I know it wasn't as feel-good
as maybe you wanted--

10:32.423 --> 10:34.008
Are you kidding? I feel great!

10:34.091 --> 10:36.135
You made a big impression with the guys
at Whitewhale.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.722
-Really?
-I'll say. They bought Girl Croosh!

10:40.306 --> 10:42.516
-What?
-Well, technically they bought Fuddruckers

10:42.600 --> 10:46.479
and merged it with Dow Chemical to create
a new media venture called Spronk!

10:46.562 --> 10:48.522
-[Diane] Hold on--
-Spronk acquired Univision,

10:48.606 --> 10:51.692
which will incorporate Girl Croosh
into the Gizmodo-branded mist

10:51.776 --> 10:52.943
of advertorial.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.404
-That's terrible!
-Not for me! I'm gonna be rich!

10:55.488 --> 10:58.324
-You already are rich!
-Oh, yeah! [giggles]

10:58.407 --> 11:02.203
Oops. Well, anyway, good luck with Spronk,
which is currently rebranding

11:02.286 --> 11:03.329
as Content Spew.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.415
So spew that content, girl! [giggles] Bye!

11:08.417 --> 11:10.211
Oh, "spronk" me.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.340
[sputters]

11:14.423 --> 11:16.926
Pardon our dust
while we finish construction.

11:17.301 --> 11:20.596
Can I get you a Pepsi Cola?
Or anything else from the vast Whitewhale

11:20.680 --> 11:22.932
agglomeration of fine beverages?
[sputters]

11:23.766 --> 11:25.434
Uh, I think we're good.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.269
Hmm.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.854
[beep]

11:29.313 --> 11:32.274
-I'm sorry about last night.
-It's fine. Let's just watch the movie.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.528
Welcome!
Here at Whitewhale Consolidated Interests,

11:35.611 --> 11:39.907
we do it all through the free-market magic
of the Whitewhale Way!

11:40.324 --> 11:42.410
[both] That's right, Mr. Whitewhale!

11:42.493 --> 11:44.578
Who? Why? Where?
Whence forth are you two,

11:44.662 --> 11:49.417
and how did you manifest in my office?
Be gone, ghastly ghouls!

11:49.500 --> 11:53.129
[giggles]
We're no spooky specters! My name's Vert!

11:53.212 --> 11:54.755
Vertical Integration!

11:54.839 --> 11:57.174
And I'm Ollie, the Oligopoly.

11:57.258 --> 12:01.846
You summoned us here to tell your new
employees about the Whitewhale Way!

12:01.929 --> 12:05.933
Well, best be quick about it,
you unholy apparitions.

12:06.016 --> 12:09.478
The Whitewhale Way was developed
by Ezekiel Whitewhale,

12:09.562 --> 12:14.483
who started small with a modest petroleum
refinery he inherited from his father.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.486
[Ollie]
One day he looked around and said,

12:17.570 --> 12:18.529
"Wait one minute!

12:18.612 --> 12:22.116
While I'm refining this oil, someone else
is getting rich drilling it,

12:22.199 --> 12:25.578
and another someone's sellin' it
to the common commuter!"

12:25.661 --> 12:28.622
So, he bought his own rig
and opened a chain of gas stations.

12:28.706 --> 12:32.001
By controlling both the means
of production and the delivery system,

12:32.084 --> 12:35.629
Ezekiel cornered the market,
and choked out the competition

12:35.713 --> 12:38.299
until they had no choice
but to sell to him, too!

12:38.382 --> 12:41.343
And that's vertical integration! [burps]

12:41.427 --> 12:43.262
[giggles] Pardon me.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.931
F-f-f-f-fast forward to the 1980s,

12:46.015 --> 12:49.435
when Jeremiah took our company
to the next level.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.855
[Vert] He bought a telephone company,
a sports team, and when he didn't like

12:52.938 --> 12:54.899
the way the newspapers
were talking about him,

12:54.982 --> 12:56.734
-he bought his own newspaper!
-[Ollie chomps]

12:56.817 --> 13:01.739
Well, I must have been a hungry whale
because I just kept gobbling up companies.

13:01.822 --> 13:05.534
Fast forward to today,
and it looks like I gobbled up you!

13:05.618 --> 13:08.537
-[chuckles]
-Are we supposed to be charmed by this?

13:08.621 --> 13:15.336
Welcome to the Whitewhale family.
Everywhere you are, that's where we'll be.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.131
Here's a list
of your new sister companies.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.802
Please be mindful of them
as you spew your content. [sputters]

13:25.429 --> 13:27.932
So we can't make videos
about any of these subsidiaries?

13:28.015 --> 13:31.435
Monsanto, JP Morgan Chase,
Marie Osmond?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.230
Oh! There it is,
the Every Animal Girl Company.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.608
You don't really think Whitewhale bought
Girl Croosh just to kill our video?

13:37.691 --> 13:40.027
And you couldn't just tell
a feel-good story about two friends

13:40.110 --> 13:41.278
who started a business.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.905
Maybe this is for the best.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.699
You can get a new job in Chicago,
spend more time with your kid.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.159
Yeah, and you can go back to LA,

13:47.243 --> 13:49.203
where you won't have to borrow my coat
all the time.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.746
-[giggles]
-Didn't you wanna write another book?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.873
I have this book of essays
I've been brewing in my head.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.417
It's called, "One Last Thing
and Then I Swear to God I'll Shut Up

13:55.501 --> 13:58.546
About This Forever: Dispatches
from the Frontlines of the War on Women:

13:58.629 --> 14:01.549
Arguments, Opinions, Reflections,
Recollections, The Razor Tax--"

14:01.632 --> 14:02.550
Is this still the title?

14:02.633 --> 14:04.885
I kind of got lost in the middle
and couldn't find a way out.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.136
No, no, it's good,

14:06.220 --> 14:08.430
I just think you want to save some of it
for the inside of the book.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.809
[sighs] I guess that's it for us,
though, right?

14:11.892 --> 14:16.772
-I guess so. Unless it isn't it for us?
-What do you mean?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.608
What if we did one more video
about anything we wanted

14:19.692 --> 14:23.070
and posted it on the website before they
realize we still have all the passwords?

14:23.153 --> 14:26.824
-We could do a story about Whitewhale.
-Oh, yeah!

14:26.907 --> 14:28.826
Now, there's a feel-good story.

14:28.909 --> 14:32.955
Me feeling good about takin'
those assholes down!

14:42.047 --> 14:45.718
Diane, this is Isabel,
star reporter at The Tribune.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.595
She's been hunting Whitewhale for years.

14:47.761 --> 14:52.141
-Call me... Isabel.
-Okay.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.435
All my days, the beast has haunted me.

14:54.518 --> 14:57.104
The hunt consumes my every waking moment.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.024
You might even say Whitewhale is my...

15:01.483 --> 15:03.152
green light at the end of the dock.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.196
-What?
-That's a Gatsby reference. Read a book.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.364
Isabel, be nice.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.326
I wish I had the energy,
but my obsession has ruined me.

15:10.409 --> 15:14.788
Destroyed my relationships,
obliterated my career. And for nothing.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.459
I had one contact on the warehouse floor,
Matt Minnowman.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.127
-Hmm.
-Then he disappeared.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.463
-Maybe there's your story.
-Not your story?

15:22.630 --> 15:26.675
Mm. My editor thought I was getting
"too invested" in the Whitewhale beat,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.677
so he moved me
to the Holiday Gift Guide desk.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.306
Now the search for the season's hot toy
torments my waking days.

15:32.389 --> 15:37.269
Are spirographs the new fidget spinners?
The answer eludes me at every turn.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.775
[Diane] I can't believe it. We got a lead.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.361
Hey, do you wanna walk back to my place?

15:45.444 --> 15:48.822
Are you kidding? It's so cold.
How is it snowing in October?

15:48.906 --> 15:52.701
There are basically two seasons here:
bitter winter, unbearable humidity.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.828
-You'll learn to love it.
-[giggles]

15:55.287 --> 15:56.372
-[Diane gasping]
-[both giggling]

15:56.455 --> 15:59.041
[BoJack's voice]
Dear Diane, I'm sure you are dying to know

15:59.124 --> 16:01.669
how this Beverly
secret admirer situation is going,

16:01.752 --> 16:03.796
-so I'll cut right to the chase.
-[Guy] Oh!

16:03.879 --> 16:07.383
I started writing "BH" on my snack kits
to clear up any confusion

16:07.466 --> 16:08.676
about who the extra nuts are for.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.889
But now Beverly thinks "BH"
stands for "Beverly, here-ya-go."

16:13.973 --> 16:16.642
"Beverly here ya go"?
Why would the "H" stand for--

16:16.725 --> 16:19.061
-[Guy and Diane moan]
-You know what? Doesn't matter.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.939
The dumbest part is that Beverly doesn't
even eat candied nuts.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.148
-[Diane moaning]
-She's allergic.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.775
So she usually just ends up

16:24.858 --> 16:26.151
-giving her nuts to me.
-[Guy snores]

16:26.235 --> 16:28.278
Doctor Champ would probably say
that means something.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.865
That the universe has a way of looking out
for us if we just stop fighting it, but...

16:32.282 --> 16:33.617
I don't know.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.078
Anyway, I guess it's working.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.999
Hope things are working
for you, too. BoJack.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.834
[keyboard clacking]

16:43.293 --> 16:44.128
Were you up all night?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.088
I was following up on this Matt Minnowman.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.841
Turns out there was an "accident"
at the warehouse.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.718
-What?
-He stayed late to finish some work.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.761
"Look at me, I'm just doing some work.
It's no big deal."

16:52.845 --> 16:54.388
Next morning, they found him dead.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.514
Oh, shit.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.434
This guy was trying to get the word out
about working conditions,

16:58.517 --> 17:00.936
and then he died in the warehouse.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.147
I got the names of some coworkers,
let's get our hands

17:03.230 --> 17:04.231
on the security footage.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.233
Did you know your cereal
was made by Whitewhale?

17:06.316 --> 17:07.317
I threw it out to be safe.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.528
Microchips-- Oh, my God,
you're looking at me like I'm crazy.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.114
You think I'm obsessed.
Am I totally scaring you off right now?

17:12.197 --> 17:14.074
No. You're glowing.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.743
Hmm.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.370
[keyboard clacking]

17:19.955 --> 17:21.915
We were working 17-hour days.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.918
We were spread thinner
than a shitty New York slice of pizza

17:25.002 --> 17:27.087
and working harder than the '96 Bulls.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.674
[Guy] Okay, so Matt's stationed here...

17:30.758 --> 17:33.635
So, what, he walked to the other side
of the room just to die?

17:33.969 --> 17:35.220
That's where he died, all right.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.598
Management left his body out there
on the floor.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.309
Almost like it was a warning
to the other workers.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.643
Wow.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.521
I just don't think you can attribute it
to intentional cruelty.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.315
-It's callousness.
-Can't it be both?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.442
Whitewhale's not evil.
They're just capitalists.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.860
What's the difference?

17:49.943 --> 17:52.279
From New York Times,
I'm Michael Barbaro. Today--

17:52.362 --> 17:54.907
-Hello?
-Mister Whitewhale would like to meet you

17:54.990 --> 17:57.785
at the Chicago Whitewhale building
tomorrow at 2:00.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.828
Bring your camera. [sputters]

18:00.287 --> 18:04.166
Oh, shit. If they know what we're doing,
why would they wanna talk to us?

18:04.249 --> 18:05.417
I guess we'll find out.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.669
I'm kind of weirdly excited.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.923
-Hey. I got you something.
-What? Shut up!

18:12.299 --> 18:13.467
-Huh.
-Ah.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.219
-You don't like it.
-No, I love it.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.472
It's just I won't get much use
out of a coat like this in LA.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.681
No. It's for here.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.226
Is this your way of asking me
to move to Chicago?

18:22.309 --> 18:27.064
No. [chuckles] Not everything is some kind
of secret underhanded conspiracy.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.817
-Sometimes a coat's just a coat.
-Okay.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.861
But I also don't know why it's so obvious
that you go back to LA.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.030
-I live there.
-But there's nothing for you there.

18:35.114 --> 18:35.989
Excuse me?

18:36.073 --> 18:38.867
I just don't understand
why you're so into punishing yourself.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.785
I am not--

18:39.868 --> 18:42.621
And it's not just yourself,
because every time you get cold,

18:42.704 --> 18:46.208
-guess who has to give you his coat.
-Oh, sorry, does that inconvenience you?

18:46.291 --> 18:49.253
No. [sighs] I just don't know
why I should suffer

18:49.336 --> 18:51.922
because you have this ideological
objection to feeling good.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.591
Are you-- I would love to feel good.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.344
What a luxury. How nice for you
that you can do that

18:57.427 --> 18:58.929
while the world burns around you.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.682
This is not even about the world,
this is about you and me.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.350
"You and me"?
What's "you and me"?

19:03.433 --> 19:05.394
-Don't--
-No, no, tell me, Guy, please,

19:05.477 --> 19:08.188
because I would love some clarification.
Am I your girlfriend?

19:08.272 --> 19:11.733
Am I the, um,
"you know, woman that I work with"?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.819
-Come on, Diane.
-What is this?

19:13.902 --> 19:17.573
I... Just take the coat.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.325
I think I should go back to the hotel.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.661
[sighs]

19:33.088 --> 19:34.423
[Diane shudders]

19:36.425 --> 19:37.926
[birds chirping]

19:43.098 --> 19:44.266
I didn't know if you'd come.

19:44.349 --> 19:48.520
Well, we got a job to do, right?
Could get chilly up there.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.526
I don't know what kind of video
you're putting together,

19:54.610 --> 19:57.321
but I wanted to let you know I don't mind.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.739
You're not gonna stop us.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.241
I don't want to stop you,
I just said that.

20:01.325 --> 20:05.162
See, when you put out stories about us
being "evil" or "callous"

20:05.245 --> 20:07.831
or whoever the bad guy in Harry Potter is,

20:07.915 --> 20:12.920
people think our business is uncompromised
by morality and our stock goes up.

20:13.086 --> 20:16.715
So, it doesn't bother your shareholders
that one of your employees died

20:16.798 --> 20:18.258
in a work-related accident?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.886
-What accident?
-Matt Minnowman's body was found

20:20.969 --> 20:22.137
in your warehouse.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.724
Oh, him, sure!
But that was no accident. I killed him.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.351
-What?
-I murdered him!

20:27.434 --> 20:28.977
Like "murdered" murdered him?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.480
Well, I didn't murder of crows him.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.733
He took too many bathroom breaks
and encouraged the other employees

20:34.816 --> 20:36.485
to take bathroom breaks as well.

20:36.568 --> 20:40.072
And you're not worried it's going
to get out that you killed an employee?

20:40.155 --> 20:42.532
Like in the video
we're shooting right now?

20:42.616 --> 20:46.954
Didn't you hear? Congress just passed
a bill legalizing murder if you're rich.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.915
-No, they didn't-- Oh, my God, they did!
-What?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.459
Hold on. Just because it passed
the House doesn't mean the Senate will--

20:52.542 --> 20:53.543
Really, Diane?

20:53.627 --> 20:55.087
Okay, but the president could still veto--

20:55.170 --> 20:56.338
Really, Diane?

20:56.421 --> 20:58.590
All right, sure, but the Supreme Court.
Okay, I get it.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.550
Look, don't take it so hard.

21:00.634 --> 21:05.305
If you wanna do something about it,
just make a billion dollars and murder me!

21:05.389 --> 21:06.932
[both cackle]

21:07.015 --> 21:10.936
Barbara, let's make sure they get
a nice Whitewhale Company gift bag

21:11.019 --> 21:13.230
-on their way out.
-[sputters]

21:16.358 --> 21:19.194
Well, we can still post the video.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.321
Why?

21:22.114 --> 21:26.743
Yeah, right, well, um, safe travels.
It's been real.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.663
Yeah. It's been real.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.544
I'm not gonna beg you to stay,
if that's what you're waiting for.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.670
I'm not waiting for anything.

21:36.753 --> 21:40.882
I'm not that guy who says, "Diane,
please don't go, I'm in love with you.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.176
Stay here in Chicago
and write your book of essays

21:43.260 --> 21:44.886
and come with me to baseball games.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.889
They've got a pretty good theater scene
here and a big shiny bean and you could...

21:48.432 --> 21:49.349
[sighs]

21:49.516 --> 21:51.727
You could be so happy
in your warm winter coat."

21:52.102 --> 21:54.855
-I don't need you to say--
-I'm not gonna be that guy, all right?

21:54.938 --> 21:58.859
But if you wanted to stay, I could
make things so good for you, Diane.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.237
-Listen--
-No, no, I get it.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.531
No, listen. Guy.

22:04.656 --> 22:08.577
I feel so shitty all the time.

22:08.660 --> 22:14.624
I feel like the whole world is pushing in
on me, except for when I'm with you.

22:15.083 --> 22:18.712
You have been such a good thing for me.

22:19.087 --> 22:24.509
But I can't be with you
if you're the only good thing in my life.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.054
It's too much pressure. I'm sorry.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.183
-Diane! Don't get on that train!
-[scoffs]

22:31.266 --> 22:34.353
-Guy, I just told you--
-I know, but you're going to the airport.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.772
That train's going to Cottage Grove,
you're gonna get screwed!

22:37.105 --> 22:38.690
Oh, no.

22:40.275 --> 22:44.279
[BoJack's voice] Dear Diane,
it was Beverly's last day yesterday.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.033
Everyone is real excited for her,
but she spent the whole day sulking

22:48.116 --> 22:51.161
because she never found out
who her secret admirer was.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.247
Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying,
so finally I just say,

22:54.331 --> 22:56.541
"It was me! I'm in love with you!"

22:56.625 --> 23:00.379
And she goes,
"Oh. I was hoping it was Mario."

23:00.796 --> 23:02.589
And then she starts crying.

23:03.256 --> 23:07.260
And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go,
you made Beverly cry on her last day".

23:08.887 --> 23:10.472
So, the thing I keep thinking about is...

23:11.598 --> 23:14.101
was it worth it for Beverly to be happy
for a little bit,

23:14.267 --> 23:16.186
even though it ended up sad?

23:16.269 --> 23:18.522
Or would it have been better
if the whole thing never happened?

23:19.356 --> 23:20.732
Every time someone leaves rehab...

23:20.899 --> 23:23.402
it makes you think
about your own progress.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.238
Some days it feels like you're not
progressing at all, other days you think,

23:26.321 --> 23:27.948
"Well, maybe a little."

23:28.031 --> 23:29.866
The main thing I think about
is how stupid I am

23:29.950 --> 23:31.451
that I didn't do this sooner.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.788
I wasted so many years being miserable
because I assumed

23:34.871 --> 23:36.706
that was the only way to be.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.042
But I don't wanna do that anymore.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.380
Also, am I crazy or have I gotten
really good at writing letters?

23:43.463 --> 23:44.714
[sighs]

23:44.798 --> 23:46.425
This is BoJack, by the way.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.178
-[phone beeps]
-[line ringing]

23:51.012 --> 23:52.973
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:53.223 --> 23:56.518
I was thinking about these grilled cheese
sandwiches I used to make,

23:56.601 --> 23:58.145
back when I first moved to LA.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.896
-What?
-I was dirt-broke

23:59.980 --> 24:02.107
and I had no friends and no job,

24:02.190 --> 24:05.735
and I got obsessed with perfecting
the art of the grilled cheese sandwich.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.696
-Makes sense.
-Partly because it was cheap,

24:07.779 --> 24:09.948
but also because while I was doing it,

24:10.031 --> 24:12.409
I wasn't thinking about how depressing
my life was.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.452
Okay.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.662
So, on the plane I was thinking,

24:15.745 --> 24:17.789
I should make
another grilled cheese sandwich

24:17.873 --> 24:21.251
because I haven't in a long time,
but I love them

24:21.334 --> 24:24.296
and they always make me feel better
about things.

24:24.379 --> 24:25.839
-Look, Diane, I gotta--
-And the thing about

24:25.922 --> 24:31.219
making your own grilled cheese sandwich
is you can do it anywhere. You know?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.263
Yeah?

24:33.555 --> 24:36.349
Yeah.
So, I guess that's another good thing.
