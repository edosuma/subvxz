WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:01.978
Previously on...

00:02.001 --> 00:03.980
It seems on
his last three trips east,

00:04.003 --> 00:05.657
he cashed in
his first-class ticket

00:05.681 --> 00:07.384
and took a detour
to Atlantic city.

00:07.408 --> 00:10.157
Lynette received
some disturbing news...

00:10.181 --> 00:14.165
He said it was okay for me to kiss
her. What else did your brother tell you?

00:14.189 --> 00:15.415
Caleb revealed a secret...

00:17.118 --> 00:20.697
Susan made
a first class confession...

00:20.721 --> 00:23.570
You're going to leave me out
here in the middle of nowhere?

00:23.594 --> 00:26.108
I can't be around you anymore.
I'm just not strong enough.

00:26.132 --> 00:28.235
And Bree made
the most difficult decision

00:28.259 --> 00:30.759
of her life.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.244
Susan Mayer
had always believed

00:37.268 --> 00:40.347
the one good thing
about hard times

00:40.371 --> 00:44.791
is that you get to find out
who your friends really are.

00:44.815 --> 00:47.194
When her grandmother died,

00:47.218 --> 00:50.097
it was Bree who brought
homemade cookies.

00:50.121 --> 00:52.699
When the critics
panned her third book,

00:52.723 --> 00:56.463
it was Gabrielle who hired
the handsome masseur.

00:56.487 --> 00:59.206
When her divorce became final,

00:59.230 --> 01:03.270
it was Lynette who poured
the scotch.

01:03.294 --> 01:07.614
Sadly, Susan's life had been
shattered once again...

01:07.638 --> 01:09.616
But as always,

01:09.640 --> 01:13.650
her friends had come to help
pick up the pieces.

01:13.674 --> 01:17.384
Susan? We've all been talking.

01:17.408 --> 01:20.457
We've decided you and Julie
should stay with Bree.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.059
Oh, thanks. No, that's okay.
We'll stay at a motel.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.461
Absolutely not.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.734
Just give me an hour or two
to straighten up Andrew's room,

01:27.758 --> 01:30.497
and then you can bring
your... selves over.

01:30.521 --> 01:32.269
I don't deserve friends
like you.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.770
We're aware of that.

01:35.126 --> 01:37.404
Susan, you're running low
on trash bags.

01:37.428 --> 01:39.406
I'm going to run to the store.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.408
Thanks, Orson.
Thanks for coming.

01:41.432 --> 01:43.780
You know,
you didn't have to do this.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.384
Hey, it's my pleasure.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.111
Mrs. Mayer!

01:54.885 --> 01:57.224
Hi. Bud penrod,

01:57.248 --> 02:00.597
town and country insurance...
The "can-do" people.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.099
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.401
Yeah. Look at that.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.833
Well, that's no fun at all,
is it?

02:06.857 --> 02:08.335
No. No, it isn't.

02:08.359 --> 02:11.138
So when am I gonna get
the check?

02:11.162 --> 02:12.739
'Cause I have a lot
of rebuilding to do.

02:12.763 --> 02:14.741
I need to get started.

02:14.765 --> 02:17.244
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
that's going to be a while.

02:17.268 --> 02:20.347
You see, the fire department
has ruled that this was arson.

02:20.371 --> 02:21.688
Arson?

02:21.712 --> 02:24.291
Yeah. So we can't give you
any money

02:24.315 --> 02:25.592
until we finish
our investigation.

02:25.616 --> 02:27.454
Who would wanna burn down
my house?

02:27.478 --> 02:30.227
I don't know.
Do you have any enemies?

02:30.251 --> 02:32.529
No. No, lookit.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.762
The whole neighborhood
turned out to help.

02:35.786 --> 02:37.564
I'm very popular.

02:37.588 --> 02:41.168
And there's no one among them
that wishes you ill?

02:41.192 --> 02:44.471
Oh, no, no.
Everybody's been very helpful.

02:44.495 --> 02:47.565
Um, everybody likes me.
Absolutely...

02:50.601 --> 02:51.818
Everyone.

02:51.842 --> 02:55.151
Yes, hard times
were what Susan used

02:55.175 --> 02:57.284
to distinguish who was a friend

02:57.308 --> 03:05.308
and who wasn't.

03:07.918 --> 03:11.338
Not everyone enjoys
being a small part

03:11.362 --> 03:12.639
of a large community.

03:12.663 --> 03:16.343
Indeed, some yearn to leave
the stress and noise

03:16.367 --> 03:19.175
of constant companionship
behind them,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.177
so they strike out on their own,

03:21.201 --> 03:25.181
hoping their solitude will
bring a little peace and quiet.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.255
It's only then they discover

03:28.279 --> 03:30.757
how dangerous it is...

03:30.781 --> 03:34.391
To be alone in the world.

04:05.416 --> 04:08.355
Zach, did you get the trash?

04:08.379 --> 04:10.627
How'd you get in here?

04:10.651 --> 04:11.858
Hiya, Paul.

04:11.882 --> 04:14.361
I stood at the back door
shouting and shouting.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.333
Were you in the little boys
room? I'm calling the police.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.964
No need. I just needed
to borrow some flour.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.536
I'm a little bit psychic,

04:19.560 --> 04:22.539
and I predict fresh-baked
cookies in your future.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.541
Zachary.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.313
What'd she want?

04:26.337 --> 04:27.774
She was in the cupboard.

04:27.798 --> 04:30.277
Get a trash bag.
We're throwing everything away.

04:30.301 --> 04:32.519
You think she was trying
to poison us?

04:32.543 --> 04:37.013
All I know is
we're eating out tonight.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.330
What doyouwant?

04:43.354 --> 04:47.464
Uh... this is a little awkward,
and I apologize in advance

04:47.488 --> 04:51.768
for how this is gonna sound,
but, um...

04:51.792 --> 04:56.042
By any chance,
did... you burn down my house?

04:56.066 --> 04:58.345
Yes.

04:58.369 --> 05:02.879
What? Yes, I burnt down your house,
you sleazy little whore.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.052
Edie! Why would you do that?!

05:06.076 --> 05:07.554
Can you blame me,

05:07.578 --> 05:10.717
after sending me
that acid letter?

05:10.741 --> 05:12.959
Letter? What letter?

05:12.983 --> 05:15.970
The one where you admitted
to stabbing me in the back

05:15.994 --> 05:17.664
by sleeping with Karl.

05:17.688 --> 05:19.295
You weren't supposed
to get that.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.297
I stole that back
from the mailman.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.630
So you were trying to hide
the truth from me?

05:23.654 --> 05:26.933
This is not what
we should focus on right now.

05:26.957 --> 05:29.836
The point is, you maliciously
set fire to my house.

05:29.860 --> 05:33.480
Look, I admit I might have...
Overreacted a tad.

05:33.504 --> 05:35.482
A tad? Edie, I have no roof!

05:35.506 --> 05:37.784
You can't just go around
burning down people's homes.

05:37.808 --> 05:40.987
Why not? You burnt down my home.

05:41.011 --> 05:43.850
You stole Mike from me.
You slept with my fiancé.

05:43.874 --> 05:45.352
That's the trifecta.

05:45.376 --> 05:47.354
You're lucky
I didn't torch your car.

05:47.378 --> 05:49.356
That's it.
I'm going to the police,

05:49.380 --> 05:51.428
and I'm telling them
what you did.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.760
Did what? I didn't do anything.

05:53.784 --> 05:56.332
What? You just confessed.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.834
No, I didn't.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.007
Did anyone else hear me confess?

06:01.031 --> 06:02.509
Hello?

06:02.533 --> 06:04.441
Hello?

06:04.465 --> 06:06.495
No witnesses.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.946
No evidence, no confession.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.848
I guess we're done here.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.850
You can go home now.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.361
Oh, wait. That's right.

06:15.385 --> 06:17.424
You don't have one.

06:25.786 --> 06:29.396
No, no, xiao-Mei,
I've told you a million times.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.398
No red meat for Mr. Solis.

06:31.422 --> 06:33.099
My triglycerides
are through the roof.

06:33.123 --> 06:36.033
Mm. Sweetie,
I need some more cream.

06:42.973 --> 06:44.943
Xiao-Mei, what's wrong?

06:47.438 --> 06:48.915
She smell.

06:48.939 --> 06:50.487
Who smells? Gaby?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.559
Excuse me. What?

06:52.583 --> 06:56.463
Her perfume... Make me sick.

06:56.487 --> 06:58.465
Honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.

06:58.489 --> 07:00.967
That tends to make everyone
a little nauseous.

07:00.991 --> 07:03.970
Xiao-Mei, your boobs...
Are they tender?

07:03.994 --> 07:05.872
Mm-hmm.

07:05.896 --> 07:08.635
Carlos! Her boobs
are none of your business.

07:08.659 --> 07:11.738
Gaby, think.
She's sensitive to smell,

07:11.762 --> 07:14.572
nauseous
and has swollen breasts.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.655
Well, I just ran her blood work.

07:28.679 --> 07:31.427
It looks like the insemination
was successful.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.428
Oh!

07:32.452 --> 07:34.931
Oh, my god.
We're gonna have a baby!

07:34.955 --> 07:36.503
Now, you should know,

07:36.527 --> 07:38.505
since she's experiencing
early symptoms,

07:38.529 --> 07:40.707
this might be
a tough pregnancy for her.

07:40.731 --> 07:43.470
Not a problem. We are gonna
treat her like a queen!

07:43.494 --> 07:46.621
Absolutely. You have nothing
to worry about here.

07:48.739 --> 07:51.548
Oh, Mrs. Solis, you smell.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.672
Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.457
I think it's gonna be a kick

08:01.481 --> 08:03.459
having Susan and Julie
stay with us.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.537
It'll be like living
in a sorority.

08:05.561 --> 08:08.635
We'll stay up late and we'll
gossip and make s'mores.

08:08.659 --> 08:10.767
Doesn't that sound like fun?

08:10.791 --> 08:14.470
Why are you pretending
to be happy?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.481
I heard you walking around
your room all night long...

08:17.505 --> 08:18.705
Crying.

08:18.729 --> 08:21.978
I don't want to talk about it.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.980
Look, I know why you're worried,

08:24.004 --> 08:27.584
but Andrew can take care
of himself, and if he can't,

08:27.608 --> 08:29.886
he shouldn't have run away
in the first place.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.958
You know what? Maybe Andrew
leaving will be good for us.

08:32.982 --> 08:36.222
You are all I have left,
and I am gonna be

08:36.246 --> 08:38.794
the best mother that I can be.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.649
There's definitely
room for improvement.

08:42.052 --> 08:44.971
It's just...

08:44.995 --> 08:47.674
You kinda forgot my birthday.

08:47.698 --> 08:50.136
What?

08:50.160 --> 08:53.610
Yeah. It was six weeks ago.

08:53.634 --> 08:57.013
Oh, my god, Danielle.
I am so sorry.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.686
It's okay.
You had a lot going on.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.688
I mean, Andrew was suing you,

09:01.712 --> 09:04.150
and you were pretty wasted
that month.

09:04.174 --> 09:07.158
Honey, you've gotta let me
make it up to you.

09:07.182 --> 09:09.155
I-I'm gonna throw you
a birthday party

09:09.179 --> 09:11.157
with all your friends, okay?

09:11.181 --> 09:13.581
That could be cool.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.933
You know what else I'd like?

09:16.957 --> 09:18.565
Name it. It's yours.

09:18.589 --> 09:20.889
I want Andrew's room.

09:22.693 --> 09:24.680
You said he's probably
not coming back,

09:24.704 --> 09:27.944
and I could really use
the extra closet space.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.717
But, sweetheart, this is...
This is his room.

09:30.741 --> 09:33.149
Mom, you forgot my birthday.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.687
You're really in no position
to negotiate.

09:35.711 --> 09:38.655
Honey, where am I gonna put
all of his things?

09:38.679 --> 09:41.658
And, you know, he might
come back at some point.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.830
He won't.

09:43.854 --> 09:47.764
Like you said,
I'm all you have left.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.298
Atlantic city?

09:52.322 --> 09:53.800
Yeah, it's last minute,

09:53.824 --> 09:55.981
but Jerry got a great deal on
a suite at one of the casinos,

09:56.005 --> 09:58.975
and a bunch of the old gang
is coming in from New York,

09:58.999 --> 10:00.977
and god, it's been forever
since I have been,

10:01.001 --> 10:02.849
so how could I turn that down?

10:02.873 --> 10:04.651
Yeah, how, indeed?

10:04.675 --> 10:06.653
What?

10:06.677 --> 10:08.715
I didn't say anything.

10:08.739 --> 10:10.787
No, but you have that look.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.689
Is something wrong?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.793
No!

10:17.117 --> 10:19.595
Except that I know you've been
to Atlantic city

10:19.619 --> 10:22.999
three times in the last month
without telling me.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.007
Ed found the receipts
when he did the office audit.

10:26.031 --> 10:27.974
Other than that,
no, nothing's wrong.

10:29.259 --> 10:31.738
Tom, it would be better
for your general well-being

10:31.762 --> 10:34.080
if you did not laugh
at this moment in time.

10:34.104 --> 10:36.087
Am I gonna have to ruin
the surprise?

10:36.111 --> 10:38.144
Because
it's a really good surprise.

10:38.168 --> 10:40.216
I'm thinking, yeah, ruin it.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.719
I have been going to
Atlantic city for business.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.860
I am up for a top spot
with Jerry's firm,

10:44.884 --> 10:47.093
huffington promotions.

10:47.117 --> 10:49.117
And if you don't believe me...

10:51.051 --> 10:55.261
You can call the c.E.O. Himself.

10:55.285 --> 11:01.267
I am... so happy
and I'm so relieved.

11:01.291 --> 11:04.240
Did you think I was cheating?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.813
No! Absolutely not. Lynette...

11:06.837 --> 11:08.675
No! Okay, a little bit.

11:08.699 --> 11:10.977
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:11.001 --> 11:13.680
Ed found receipts for flowers
and theater tickets.

11:13.704 --> 11:16.931
I mean, by the way, did you...
Jerry and I went to a show,

11:16.955 --> 11:19.655
and the flowers
were for milt's wife.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.328
I knew that. You didn't
have to tell me that.

11:22.352 --> 11:24.769
Why did you buy flowers
for milt's wife? Lynette...

11:24.793 --> 11:28.664
Sorry. Stop. Done talking.
That's fantastic.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.697
I love you!

11:30.721 --> 11:32.121
I love you.

11:53.343 --> 11:54.753
Carlos...

11:57.417 --> 11:59.195
What's going on?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.097
Xiao-Mei is feeling
under the weather,

12:01.121 --> 12:03.800
so I took up the vacuuming.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.807
Oh, well,
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:05.831 --> 12:07.874
So, uh, did you move
my beauty products?

12:07.898 --> 12:10.898
They're not in the bathroom.

12:11.962 --> 12:13.439
Why in the hell?

12:13.463 --> 12:17.320
I forgot to tell you. Uh, you
can't use that stuff anymore.

12:17.344 --> 12:20.817
It really triggers
xiao-Mei's morning sickness.

12:20.841 --> 12:24.320
All of it? Even my hair pomade?

12:24.344 --> 12:27.428
Gives me stomachache. Yeah,
well, it gives me volume,

12:27.452 --> 12:30.056
so I guess we're both
gonna have a problem.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.458
Do you have to be
so high-maintenance?

12:32.482 --> 12:35.869
You're not a model, Carlos.
Maintenance is my only skill.

12:35.893 --> 12:37.934
Please, no fight.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.458
If Mrs. Solis smell bad,
I be okay.

12:43.363 --> 12:48.214
Fine. I'll learn
to live without product.

12:48.238 --> 12:50.917
But when my hair
starts smelling like hair,

12:50.941 --> 12:52.941
I don't wanna hear a word.

12:55.846 --> 12:58.354
Surprise!

12:58.378 --> 13:00.256
What the hell is that?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.929
Isn't it darling?
I made it for your party.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.940
It's a big "1" and a big "7"...

13:06.056 --> 13:07.093
For "17."

13:07.117 --> 13:09.996
Were you up all night
making that thing?

13:10.020 --> 13:11.898
Yeah. I just wasn't tired.

13:11.922 --> 13:14.200
Oh, I wanna show you
what else I've planned.

13:14.224 --> 13:16.402
I think you're gonna love it.

13:16.426 --> 13:18.905
You got a fajita bar
and a juggler?

13:18.929 --> 13:20.546
No, relax.
He's a very hip juggler.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.879
He only performs
to Beatles songs,

13:22.903 --> 13:25.186
and I saw the video,
and it's absolutely thrilling.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.513
Mom, I don't want
any of this stuff.

13:27.537 --> 13:31.057
It's not even my real birthday. Danielle,
I just want you to have the best party

13:31.081 --> 13:33.059
you have ever had
in your entire life.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.930
I just want a few friends
to come over and hang out.

13:35.954 --> 13:37.463
You can make a cake,

13:37.487 --> 13:38.965
but giant balloon numbers?

13:38.989 --> 13:42.268
I mean, come on.
They would all make fun of me.

13:42.292 --> 13:45.602
Oh.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.827
Okay.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.484
Is that really necessary?

13:58.508 --> 14:01.908
Honey, I can't possibly
put it in the garbage as is.

14:06.977 --> 14:09.555
It's just another morning
with the Van de kamps.

14:09.579 --> 14:11.827
Oh, Susan, did I wake you?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.360
Uh, no. No, I was up.

14:14.384 --> 14:16.367
Well, I'm sorry about the noise.

14:16.391 --> 14:18.865
It's just that Danielle
doesn't want balloons,

14:18.889 --> 14:20.867
and I'm kind of pressed
for time.

14:20.891 --> 14:25.341
Bree... are you okay?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.345
She said she doesn't
want balloons.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.199
I'm fine.

14:42.112 --> 14:44.190
Mom?

14:44.214 --> 14:48.094
Look, I know you're out there.
Please, just talk to me.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.566
Mom, I need something to drink.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.869
Just some water, some juice.
Something, anything. Please.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.903
Mom!

14:59.970 --> 15:03.509
You want me to say
that I set Caleb up?

15:03.533 --> 15:06.913
Yeah, I did it.

15:08.578 --> 15:11.057
I started thinking
about all those years...

15:11.081 --> 15:14.160
Years that we had
to take care of him, and...

15:14.184 --> 15:16.993
I just thought
maybe once he was gone,

15:17.017 --> 15:19.125
we could have a normal life.

15:19.149 --> 15:23.029
And I'm sorry.

15:23.053 --> 15:26.340
But, mom, you have got
to let me out of here now.

15:26.364 --> 15:29.635
Damn you!

15:29.659 --> 15:31.637
You were willing to stand by

15:31.661 --> 15:35.481
and let me murder your brother
without reason.

15:35.505 --> 15:38.184
That's an unforgivable betrayal.

15:38.208 --> 15:41.017
I am so consumed with rage.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.020
It's best you stay in there,
because if I let you out,

15:44.044 --> 15:48.324
I don't know what
I might do to you.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.334
Hello?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.336
I need Edie to spill her guts.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.360
What do you know
about wearing a wire?

16:03.733 --> 16:05.616
So you see the
little red light? Mm.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.113
It's all voice-activated,

16:07.137 --> 16:09.115
so if the light's on,
you're recording.

16:09.139 --> 16:11.617
Uh, let me show you
how to tape it on.

16:11.641 --> 16:13.449
Oh, okay.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.451
Sorry if my hands are cold.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.405
Um... no, that's okay.
They're fine.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.232
So you sure you wanna do this?

16:26.256 --> 16:28.394
Yeah. I'm sort of
up against the wall.

16:28.418 --> 16:30.396
The insurance company
needs proof fast,

16:30.420 --> 16:33.099
and things are sort of weird
at Bree's.

16:33.123 --> 16:35.280
I don't wanna overstay
my welcome.

16:35.304 --> 16:40.246
Well, if things get tough,
you can always stay here.

16:40.270 --> 16:42.048
Testing, testing.

16:42.072 --> 16:46.052
I'm sorry. Did you just
invite me to move in with you?

16:46.076 --> 16:48.654
Well, you and Julie
in the spare bedroom.

16:48.678 --> 16:50.016
Oh.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.687
You've...

16:51.711 --> 16:54.690
You've been saying how
you want to be friends again,

16:54.714 --> 16:56.192
and you're right.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.695
There's no reason
we can't be friends.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.369
You sure that won't put a crimp
in your, uh, dating life?

17:03.393 --> 17:07.103
You know, that girl
you were at the movies with?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.773
No. That was a one-time thing.

17:08.798 --> 17:12.078
But what about that guy,
though? Orson.

17:12.102 --> 17:16.112
Yeah, he just heard about
the fire and came over to help.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.242
We're friends.

17:17.267 --> 17:20.586
Oh. So... neither of us
is dating anybody.

17:20.609 --> 17:23.069
Guess not.

17:26.415 --> 17:29.395
I got my boarding pass.

17:29.419 --> 17:32.228
Do what you need to do
and don't worry about the kids.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.230
I'll keep 'em out of trouble.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.731
Is this crazy?

17:35.755 --> 17:38.033
Following Tom across the country
just to spy on him?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.035
If he knew I was doing this...

17:40.059 --> 17:43.109
God, I don't think
I can go through with this.

17:43.133 --> 17:45.150
Now, look, there's probably
nothing going on,

17:45.174 --> 17:48.114
but you need to know the truth.

17:48.138 --> 17:49.415
Do I? I'm happy.

17:49.439 --> 17:52.278
I mean, I was. Why don't I
just look the other way

17:52.302 --> 17:55.286
and pretend nothing's wrong?
Lots of women can do that.

17:55.310 --> 17:57.323
But we both know
you're not one of them.

17:57.347 --> 18:01.147
And what if I see him
with another woman? What then?

18:03.683 --> 18:06.123
I own a gun.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.175
♪♪♪

18:26.576 --> 18:28.854
You okay here?

18:28.878 --> 18:31.086
I'm fine. Why?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.589
It's just, people have been
asking about the cake,

18:33.613 --> 18:36.096
and you've been icing it
for over an hour.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.093
Well, I just keep messing it up.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.095
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.597
You're probably just tired.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.270
My mom and I heard you
up all night.

18:44.294 --> 18:47.204
It just keeps
coming out too thick.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.107
You know,
people aren't gonna care

18:52.131 --> 18:54.680
if the icing isn't perfect.

18:54.704 --> 18:59.285
People care about details.

18:59.309 --> 19:01.587
Someday when Danielle
looks back,

19:01.611 --> 19:04.690
I want her to remember
just how perfect her cake looked

19:04.714 --> 19:07.601
and how hard her mother worked
to make her happy.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.617
This cake is a symbol
of my love.

19:12.522 --> 19:17.292
Well, it looks delicious.

19:19.689 --> 19:23.239
♪ happy birthday to you ♪

19:23.263 --> 19:27.142
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

19:27.166 --> 19:30.176
♪ Happy birthday ♪

19:30.200 --> 19:32.218

19:32.242 --> 19:35.651
Stop!
One of the candles went out.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.654
Um, we're gonna have to do this
all over again.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.656
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.189
Mom, it's all right. Sweetheart,
this is your special day.

19:43.213 --> 19:45.561
All of your candles
should be lit.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.163
It'll just take me two seconds.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.465
Is she serious?

19:49.489 --> 19:51.789
Welcome to my own private hell.

19:55.665 --> 19:58.374
That is some serious frosting.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.198
All righty.

20:15.345 --> 20:17.923
Who touched this?

20:17.947 --> 20:21.196
Mom, what is the matter?
It's just a little frosting.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.698
Somebody ruined your cake,

20:22.722 --> 20:25.609
and I wanna know
who could be that thoughtless.

20:25.633 --> 20:28.374
Was it you? Or you?! Who was it?

20:28.398 --> 20:30.436
Mom, please,
you're embarrassing me.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.939
You. You look like a girl
who enjoys her frosting.

20:33.963 --> 20:37.212
No! No, I didn't touch it.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.215
It's just a cake, for god sakes.
Will you please just cut it?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.717
Mrs. Van De Kamp...

20:41.741 --> 20:43.919
Open your mouth.
I wanna smell your breath.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.951
It wasn't me! It was Barbie.

20:45.975 --> 20:47.453
Barbie!

20:49.479 --> 20:51.897
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

20:51.921 --> 20:55.431
Now it's ruined!
Everything is ruined!

21:04.394 --> 21:06.742
Um...

21:06.766 --> 21:08.974
You can just...
Leave that there,

21:08.998 --> 21:13.268
and I'll, um...
Clean it up later.

21:19.609 --> 21:22.257
Xiao-Mei, what are you
doing in our bed?

21:22.281 --> 21:25.260
I said she could sleep
in there from now on.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.638
It's got the bathroom,
you know, in case

21:27.662 --> 21:29.965
she gets sick
in the middle of the night.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.738
Well, what's wrong with the
guest bathroom? It's too far away.

21:32.762 --> 21:35.679
It's right down the hall.
Gaby, she needs her rest.

21:35.703 --> 21:37.343
And besides, that bed

21:37.367 --> 21:39.975
is much more comfortable
than the one in the guest room.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.477
Yeah, I know.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.910
That's why I had the movers
put it in here, wherewesleep.

21:44.934 --> 21:48.414
Maybe I go to my bed.

21:48.438 --> 21:50.708
Yes, xiao-Mei,
that would be good.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.441
Uh-oh.

21:56.846 --> 22:00.546
Fine. You can use our toilet.

22:06.496 --> 22:07.973
Ow! Stop kicking me.

22:07.997 --> 22:09.975
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

22:09.999 --> 22:13.339
Yeah, in a twin? Good luck.

22:13.363 --> 22:16.311
God, I want my bed back.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.814
We'll go buy a nice big one
tomorrow

22:18.838 --> 22:22.087
and put it in here, okay? That is not the
point. We are a week into this pregnancy,

22:22.111 --> 22:25.090
and you're already putting
xiao-Mei's needs before mine.

22:25.114 --> 22:28.454
Well, she's the priority now.
She's the mother of my child.

22:29.719 --> 22:33.328
Like hell she is. That ismyegg.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.369
You know what I mean.
She's the...

22:35.393 --> 22:37.332
Oven, Carlos. The oven.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.505
A well-cared-for,
well-paid oven.

22:39.529 --> 22:41.507
It came out wrong.
I'm sorry, okay?

22:41.531 --> 22:44.061
Now can we just get some sleep?

22:46.566 --> 22:48.674
Ohh! Babe, I'm sorry.

22:48.698 --> 22:50.716
I swear.
I swear I didn't mean to.

22:50.740 --> 22:53.449
My leg just cramped up.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.953
Where are you going?
That's my pillow!

22:57.547 --> 22:59.385
Good night.

23:03.553 --> 23:05.863
Matthew!

23:22.902 --> 23:24.750
Mom, come on.

23:24.774 --> 23:27.458
Oh, my god.
What are you doing in there?

23:27.482 --> 23:28.754
Danielle, is that you?

23:28.778 --> 23:30.756
My mom found out
what we did to Caleb.

23:30.780 --> 23:33.889
She flipped out and locked me in
here. Don't worry. I'll get you out.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.896
Be really careful, okay?
Please, okay?

23:35.920 --> 23:38.063
I've never seen her
like this before.

23:38.087 --> 23:40.065
She's seriously lost it
this time.

23:40.089 --> 23:42.568
I know a little something
about psycho moms.

23:42.592 --> 23:45.130
Trust me, I'll be fine.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.138
Hey.

23:53.162 --> 23:56.181
Cleaning up after the big party?

23:56.205 --> 23:58.865
Yeah.

24:01.471 --> 24:02.748
You know, it's late.

24:02.772 --> 24:05.420
Why don't you, uh,
go to bed and, you know,

24:05.444 --> 24:08.431
let Julie and I help you
with that in the morning?

24:08.455 --> 24:11.927
Oh, that's okay.
I can't sleep anyway.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.660
Are you... okay?

24:14.684 --> 24:17.603
I take it you heard
what happened.

24:17.627 --> 24:20.706
Yeah, when you flip out
in front of the pep squad,

24:20.730 --> 24:23.569
word travels fast.

24:23.593 --> 24:25.741
It was the oddest sensation.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.443
I was fine,
and everything was fine,

24:28.467 --> 24:32.478
and then suddenly I was
on the outside of my body

24:32.502 --> 24:35.581
watching a woman
who looked like me

24:35.605 --> 24:38.023
becoming a raving maniac.

24:38.047 --> 24:41.186
Bree, I'm worried about you.
Do...

24:41.210 --> 24:43.689
Do you think that you should
see someone? Oh, no, I'm fine.

24:43.713 --> 24:47.097
I'm just tired, that's all.
I just need a long rest,

24:47.121 --> 24:49.595
and then I'm gonna be
as good as new.

24:49.619 --> 24:54.469
Okay, well, then why
don't you stop and go to bed?

24:54.493 --> 24:58.504
Because, um, I can't sleep
just yet.

24:58.528 --> 24:59.775
Why not?

24:59.799 --> 25:01.476
Because when I sleep, I dream,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.679
and when I dream,
I keep seeing Andrew's face

25:03.703 --> 25:05.180
in that rearview mirror.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.053
Okay, what are you
talking about?

25:08.077 --> 25:11.717
Andrew, um...

25:11.741 --> 25:13.281
Didn't run away.

25:15.585 --> 25:22.097
I, um, dropped him off
in the middle of nowhere,

25:22.121 --> 25:24.600
told him that I couldn't
be around him anymore,

25:24.624 --> 25:27.102
and then...

25:27.126 --> 25:28.626
I drove off.

25:34.163 --> 25:37.150
So I just need a little time
to forget what I've done,

25:37.174 --> 25:40.206
and then I can sleep again.

25:42.572 --> 25:43.612
Hey.

25:48.718 --> 25:50.726
You know, I am not even tired.

25:50.750 --> 25:57.230
So... why don't I stay up
and help you?

25:58.557 --> 26:00.687
That would be nice.

26:27.717 --> 26:30.766
Thank you.

26:36.826 --> 26:37.873
Hello?

26:37.897 --> 26:40.706
Hey, you. How you doing?

26:40.730 --> 26:42.848
Hey! Great.

26:42.872 --> 26:47.582
Great. How's Atlantic city?
Are you, um, winning some money?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.114
Oh, I'm about even.

26:49.138 --> 26:51.586
Actually, I'm heading back
into the casino right now

26:51.610 --> 26:53.158
to try my luck again. Yeah?

26:53.182 --> 26:54.960
You're quite a gambler.

26:56.245 --> 26:58.724
Where's Jerry?

26:58.748 --> 27:01.727
Uh, Jerry?

27:01.751 --> 27:04.670
He... he's right here.
Hey, honey, how are the kids?

27:04.694 --> 27:06.981
Great. Great.
They're in the day care room.

27:07.005 --> 27:10.075
I'm... looking at 'em right now.

27:10.099 --> 27:12.377
Hey, why don't you
walk in there and, um,

27:12.401 --> 27:15.380
put 'em on the phone with me
so I can say hi?

27:15.404 --> 27:17.012
Okay. Sure.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.214
First, can I talk to Jerry?

27:19.238 --> 27:21.647
Why do you wanna talk to Jerry?

27:21.671 --> 27:24.750
Well, just, you know, say hello.
It's been a long time.

27:30.820 --> 27:32.627
Wow, man, that is weird.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.130
Can you hear...
Do you hear that car alarm?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.963
Uh... no.

27:37.987 --> 27:40.666
It's strange,
because I can hear it here

27:40.690 --> 27:43.238
andthrough the phone.

27:43.262 --> 27:46.146
Whoa. That's weird kind of feedback,
you know?

27:46.170 --> 27:48.143
Physics can be spooky that way.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.145
Listen, I gotta go. I gotta go.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.147
Ed is talking to me, and, um,

27:52.171 --> 27:54.149
I'll call you back later?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.180
Um, okay.

27:55.204 --> 27:56.982
Okay, bye.

27:57.006 --> 27:58.376
Bye, honey.

28:11.821 --> 28:13.799
9-1-1.
Is this an emergency?

28:13.823 --> 28:15.100
I think so.

28:15.124 --> 28:18.411
My neighbor, Paul young,
has been threatening me.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.405
Is he there right now?

28:20.429 --> 28:21.807
No.

28:21.831 --> 28:23.809
Ma'am, until he actually
does something,

28:23.833 --> 28:25.811
there's nothing we can do.

28:25.835 --> 28:27.813
Well, I won't live in fear
anymore.

28:27.837 --> 28:29.815
If you people refuse
to confront him,

28:29.839 --> 28:32.209
I guess I'll just have to
do it myself.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.780
No, Edie, wait.
Um, I don't wanna fight.

28:54.804 --> 28:56.787
I know that we've had
our differences,

28:56.811 --> 28:58.744
but, you know, we had
a friendship going there,

28:58.768 --> 29:01.286
and I just think we owe it
to ourselves

29:01.310 --> 29:03.288
to talk about what happened.

29:03.312 --> 29:06.752
What's there to talk about?
It happened.

29:06.776 --> 29:08.754
I walked down to your house...

29:08.778 --> 29:11.126
I had a
watering can... What?

29:11.150 --> 29:13.298
Filled it with gasoline and...

29:13.322 --> 29:16.031
Boom! Laughed my ass off.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.503
Okay, wait.
Could you just swallow?

29:18.527 --> 29:20.205
'Cause I couldn't really...
What you were saying...

29:20.229 --> 29:21.736
And that was basically it.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.738
One of the best days of my life.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.740
Well, see, you were chewing,

29:25.764 --> 29:27.918
and so I didn't really
hear what you said.

29:27.942 --> 29:29.915
Could you just say it again?

29:29.939 --> 29:32.918
I burnt your house down.
It was great. What do you want?

29:32.942 --> 29:34.920
So, uh, y-you then a-admit

29:34.944 --> 29:39.014
burning down my house
on purpose?

29:46.355 --> 29:48.333
You're wearing a wire,
aren't you?

29:48.357 --> 29:49.764
Huh?

29:49.788 --> 29:52.237
Open that blouse. What?

29:52.261 --> 29:53.899
Open that blouse!

29:53.923 --> 29:55.871
Aah!

29:56.826 --> 29:58.804
You can't outrun me, Mayer!

29:58.828 --> 30:00.946
I'm in the best shape
of my life!

30:00.970 --> 30:03.508
Well, good, then you'll be
prime meat picking

30:03.532 --> 30:05.210
when you go to jail!
You give it!

30:05.234 --> 30:06.944
Bite me!

30:09.378 --> 30:11.857
Aha!

30:11.881 --> 30:13.919
No! No!

30:13.943 --> 30:15.390
Ow!

30:15.414 --> 30:16.922
Ow!

30:19.488 --> 30:23.048
What the hell? Huh.

30:24.453 --> 30:25.800
Aah!

32:07.226 --> 32:10.175
Nine months
of long nights on the couch

32:10.199 --> 32:13.129
loomed before Gabrielle...

32:14.703 --> 32:19.544
And she had decided she would
not take it lying down.

32:19.568 --> 32:24.108
So she dipped into her supply
of forbidden perfumes...

32:25.414 --> 32:29.354
Determined
that in this battle...

32:29.378 --> 32:34.078
She would be the one to
come out smelling like a Rose.

32:36.025 --> 32:38.003
I think I take nap now.

32:38.027 --> 32:40.357
Yeah, sure, knock yourself out.

32:44.433 --> 32:48.443
Aah!

32:58.407 --> 33:00.077
Honey?

33:05.614 --> 33:07.164
Boys?

33:10.489 --> 33:12.689
Anybody home?

33:15.664 --> 33:17.751
Hey, Mrs. McCluskey, excuse me.

33:17.775 --> 33:21.146
You haven't seen
Lynette around, have you?

33:21.170 --> 33:24.149
She's not home. She's not
answering her cell phone.

33:24.173 --> 33:26.120
She packed up the kids
and the puppy and left.

33:26.144 --> 33:27.612
Packed 'em up? Why?

33:27.636 --> 33:30.115
She followed you
to Atlantic city.

33:30.139 --> 33:32.457
She knows about
your other woman.

33:32.481 --> 33:37.021
Boy, you're just lucky
you're not my husband.

33:44.353 --> 33:46.023
Hi.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.011
Okay, first, let me say,

33:57.035 --> 33:59.465
I'm really sorry
about the yellowjackets.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.789
And... also, no matter how mad
I am about what you did,

34:04.813 --> 34:07.392
I don't want to see you
go to prison.

34:07.416 --> 34:11.126
So I came with a solution.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.129
Why don't you just come forward
and tell the police

34:14.152 --> 34:17.601
that you saw some vagrant
lurking by my garage

34:17.626 --> 34:19.603
with a can of gasoline?

34:19.628 --> 34:24.208
And if you do that,
then I'll destroy the tape.

34:24.233 --> 34:27.080
And then the insurance company
will pay the claim.

34:27.103 --> 34:28.473
Nobody gets hurt.

34:28.496 --> 34:30.667
Does that sound good?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.119
Come closer.

34:34.143 --> 34:36.112
Oh, uh...

34:42.681 --> 34:45.659
Take your stinking deal
and shove it.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.331
Edie...

34:47.356 --> 34:49.333
Every time something bad
happens to me,

34:49.358 --> 34:51.335
you're standing nearby.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.638
Well, I've had it.

34:53.661 --> 34:55.639
No more pretending
to be friends.

34:55.664 --> 34:58.743
When I get outta here,
I'm gonna destroy you.

34:58.767 --> 35:03.208
Okay, I'm just gonna think
that this is the meds talking,

35:03.232 --> 35:05.750
and I'll come back tomorrow.

35:05.774 --> 35:07.852
Don't bother.

35:07.876 --> 35:10.215
Okay, Edie, I'm in trouble here.

35:10.239 --> 35:12.717
Oh, I'm sure you'll turn on
the waterworks,

35:12.741 --> 35:14.719
and the whole neighborhood
will come running.

35:14.743 --> 35:16.221
They always do.

35:16.245 --> 35:18.693
That's not true. Sure, it is.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.726
You never miss an opportunity
to play the victim,

35:21.750 --> 35:23.728
and you think just because

35:23.752 --> 35:26.831
everybody always comes
to your rescue,

35:26.855 --> 35:29.103
it means that you're loved.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.875
Well, it doesn't.

35:30.899 --> 35:34.279
It means that you're helpless.

35:34.303 --> 35:36.881
Now get out.

35:36.905 --> 35:39.235
Just get out.

35:48.277 --> 35:49.594
Hey there.

35:49.618 --> 35:51.526
Hi.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.859
So you given any thought
to staying at my place?

35:54.883 --> 35:58.603
Oh, yeah, that. Um...

35:58.627 --> 36:00.665
Look, I really appreciate
the offer,

36:00.689 --> 36:02.867
but I think I'm gonna
have to pass.

36:02.891 --> 36:04.609
Really? Yeah.

36:04.633 --> 36:07.217
I think it's best. I don't
wanna get a rep around here

36:07.241 --> 36:09.214
for being a charity case,
you know?

36:09.238 --> 36:11.216
Well, I didn't mean it
that way...

36:11.240 --> 36:13.518
Just one friend
helping out another.

36:13.542 --> 36:17.782
I know, but I can figure
this out on my own.

36:17.806 --> 36:19.906
At least I'm gonna try.

36:21.410 --> 36:25.230
You know, I'm stronger than
people give me credit for.

36:25.254 --> 36:26.531
I really am.

36:26.555 --> 36:29.694
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

36:29.718 --> 36:33.668
You know what would be nice?

36:33.692 --> 36:37.272
Why don't you just stop over
for coffee sometime?

36:37.296 --> 36:38.743
Okay.

36:38.767 --> 36:40.745
I mean, that is after I get

36:40.769 --> 36:42.747
running water
and electricity again...

36:42.771 --> 36:44.749
And a coffeemaker.

36:51.780 --> 36:54.659
I hope you're happy.
That poor girl can hardly even

36:54.683 --> 36:57.362
come upstairs now
because of you.

36:57.386 --> 37:00.465
Carlos, stop with the dance.
It's already in the wallpaper.

37:00.489 --> 37:03.928
Now I swear, if anything happens
to that kid because of you...

37:03.952 --> 37:06.331
Oh, it's perfume, not toxic gas.

37:06.355 --> 37:07.832
Why are you acting this way?

37:07.856 --> 37:09.834
Because I see
the writing on the wall,

37:09.858 --> 37:11.976
and it scares the hell
out of me.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.438
Meaning what?

37:13.462 --> 37:15.440
From the second
xiao-Mei got pregnant,

37:15.464 --> 37:18.688
you have found a million and one
ways to tell me that

37:18.712 --> 37:21.416
that baby is more important to
you than me. Oh, come on, Gaby.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.418
No! Men can't help it.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.750
When they become fathers,
they become lousy husbands,

37:25.774 --> 37:27.297
and some wives don't mind,

37:27.321 --> 37:29.294
but you didn't marry
one of those women.

37:29.318 --> 37:31.796
I don't think I can sleep
in here tonight.

37:31.820 --> 37:34.250
The air's
just a little too toxic.

37:42.991 --> 37:46.371
She kick you out, too?

37:46.395 --> 37:48.373
Marriage is complicated,
xiao-Mei.

37:48.397 --> 37:50.375
You'll find that out someday.

37:50.399 --> 37:54.439
You feel like watching
some trashy American TV?

37:57.306 --> 37:58.723
I make you sandwich.

37:58.747 --> 38:00.725
Roast beef.

38:00.749 --> 38:02.527
Oh, man.

38:02.551 --> 38:04.859
Gaby's got me
on this health kick thing.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.870
She'll kill me
if I eat red meat.

38:06.894 --> 38:09.455
I will not tell.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.726
Taste good?

38:22.401 --> 38:23.401
Real good.

38:25.474 --> 38:29.354
Matthew, wake up.
I have your breakfast.

38:29.378 --> 38:31.356
I might be furious with you,

38:31.380 --> 38:33.880
but never let it be said
that I'm cruel.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.601
I advise you not to charge
this door,

38:37.625 --> 38:42.497
because I am not in the mood
for any unpleasantness.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.569
Matthew?

38:44.593 --> 38:47.732
Matthew?

38:47.756 --> 38:48.873
Aah!

38:55.003 --> 38:57.990
Jeez, Danielle! I thought you
were just gonna steal the key.

38:58.014 --> 39:00.066
Let's just get out of here.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.434
Mother, Matthew and I

39:19.458 --> 39:21.936
are running away together,
and we're never coming back.

39:21.960 --> 39:26.811
If you want me to be happy,
you won't try to find us.

39:26.835 --> 39:30.415
Living in that house with you
was like being in a prison.

39:30.439 --> 39:33.347
You drove me to do this, so I
hope you'll blame yourself.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.701
Have a nice life. Danielle.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.927
Hello.

39:42.951 --> 39:44.929
My name is Bree Van De Kamp,

39:44.953 --> 39:49.063
and I'd like to admit myself
for psychiatric observation.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.566
All right,
what seems to be the problem?

39:51.590 --> 39:55.390
I think I'm about to have
a nervous breakdown.

40:02.971 --> 40:05.750
Damn it!

40:10.108 --> 40:12.408
What the hell?

40:18.987 --> 40:21.887
That psychotic bitch.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.960
There was no confrontation.

40:55.984 --> 40:58.141
Felicia tillman's the one
who made the call.

40:58.165 --> 40:59.964
She's the anonymous tip.

40:59.988 --> 41:01.866
Let's just go over there
right now.

41:01.890 --> 41:03.568
I guarantee you,

41:03.592 --> 41:06.549
the woman is having a cocktail,
laughing her ass off.

41:06.573 --> 41:09.944
We're not going anywhere yet,
sir. Ahem.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.478
Yes, I know
there's blood everywhere.

41:13.502 --> 41:15.480
She probably got it from a pig

41:15.504 --> 41:18.584
so she can vandalize
everything I own.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.486
Sergeant...

41:21.510 --> 41:24.458
What is it?

41:24.482 --> 41:27.162
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

41:33.822 --> 41:36.572
Oh, man, she's good.

41:39.628 --> 41:42.607
It's a shocking moment
for each of us,

41:42.631 --> 41:47.581
that moment we realize
we are all alone in this world.

41:48.837 --> 41:53.637
The family we take for granted
could one day abandon us.

41:56.184 --> 41:59.664
The husband we trust
so implicitly

41:59.688 --> 42:01.718
might betray us...

42:03.692 --> 42:09.774
The daughter we love so deeply
perhaps won't return to us.

42:09.798 --> 42:13.928
And then we could end up
all by ourselves.

42:16.064 --> 42:21.546
Of course, some see great value
in going it alone.

42:21.570 --> 42:23.217
For example...

42:23.241 --> 42:25.219
Sorry about the dust,
Mrs. Huber.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.230
We don't get too many tourists
this far up the mountain.

42:28.254 --> 42:29.724
First snows come,

42:29.748 --> 42:32.226
and this place
is completely cut off.

42:32.250 --> 42:34.228
Dropping off the face
of the earth...

42:34.252 --> 42:36.230
Now that's what I call
a vacation.

42:37.656 --> 42:38.633
I'm sorry.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.157
Oh.

42:44.032 --> 42:47.042
Sometimes I'm just all thumbs.
