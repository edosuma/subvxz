But you can't, can ya?

01:13.605 --> 01:14.725
'Cause you're useless.

01:15.365 --> 01:17.165
Who's useless? Who's useless?

01:17.605 --> 01:18.445
You are!

01:19.045 --> 01:19.965
You are.

01:20.445 --> 01:21.445
You're useless.

Good girl.

01:44.285 --> 01:46.125
Do you still want me
to put it through the door?

01:46.365 --> 01:47.845
No, you can give it to me.

01:48.445 --> 01:51.325
Just a postcard from Mike and Beth,
whoever they are.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.085
Friends.

01:53.605 --> 01:54.645
What's it say?

01:54.725 --> 01:56.365
They're having a great time, and...

01:56.885 --> 01:57.965
Mike's had diarrhea.

02:00.205 --> 02:01.045
Good.

02:01.645 --> 02:04.525
Well, let's hope you're still my postman
when I'm blind.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.005
Go on.

02:14.485 --> 02:17.565
[woman] Well, we went to that nice
Greek restaurant that we usually go to.

02:17.645 --> 02:19.725
You know that one at the top of the road?

02:19.925 --> 02:22.885
Well, Sheila was in a terrible mood again.
Well...

02:26.165 --> 02:27.205
I'm going mad.

02:28.525 --> 02:30.325
You're only mad if they answer back.

02:31.245 --> 02:32.485
He does answer back.

02:35.525 --> 02:36.445
What does he say?

02:37.165 --> 02:38.485
Depends what I ask him.

02:39.525 --> 02:40.365
'Course.

02:42.405 --> 02:43.245
Your mum?

02:46.125 --> 02:46.965
My wife.

02:47.965 --> 02:48.805
Oh.

02:50.045 --> 02:50.885
Sorry.

02:53.165 --> 02:54.605
Stan was my husband.

02:56.765 --> 02:57.605
I'm Anne.

02:58.685 --> 02:59.525
I'm Tony.

03:01.445 --> 03:02.325
Nice to meet you.

03:07.765 --> 03:09.005
He seems nice.

03:09.925 --> 03:11.685
-Does he agree?
-Of course.

03:12.885 --> 03:14.485
Never disagreed with me once.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.605
Not in 48 years. [chuckles]

03:20.645 --> 03:21.805
I didn't get that long.

[inhales deeply]

[Tony exhales]

03:45.245 --> 03:47.405
I met a nice lady in the graveyard, Dad.

03:49.685 --> 03:51.285
Don't tell Lisa.

03:52.325 --> 03:53.445
[quietly] Fuck me.

03:55.325 --> 03:56.485
She's more your age.

A bit of Viagra... [whistles]

Bob's your uncle.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.285
Is he?

04:07.045 --> 04:08.085
Always nice to chat.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.765
Right, here we go at last.

04:10.845 --> 04:12.765
-Hi.
-Sorry about that. Oh, hi!

04:13.405 --> 04:14.565
Right, cup of tea.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.245
Two sugars.

04:16.645 --> 04:19.365
Right, let's get you sorted,
give you a wee comb.

04:21.165 --> 04:23.205
Doesn't look too bad, actually, does it?

04:23.925 --> 04:27.245
It's nice out there today.
We'll get out in the garden later on, eh?

04:29.365 --> 04:31.245
[sighs] I don't know how you do it.

04:31.885 --> 04:32.765
What?

04:32.845 --> 04:33.805
Stay sane.

04:34.845 --> 04:36.605
He doesn't know what you're on about,
does he?

04:36.685 --> 04:38.445
He doesn't remember you, I bet.

04:38.885 --> 04:40.285
He doesn't know he's alive.

04:40.485 --> 04:41.405
What is the point?

04:41.485 --> 04:42.925
What do you mean, "What's the point?"

04:43.325 --> 04:44.805
They helped us when they could,

04:44.885 --> 04:47.725
now they can't.
He can't even help himself, so I do.

04:48.445 --> 04:50.485
No, I know. But is it for the best?

04:51.285 --> 04:52.885
We don't know what they're feeling.

04:52.965 --> 04:53.885
They don't know.

04:54.365 --> 04:55.325
[nurse] So just in case,

04:55.725 --> 04:57.325
be nice to them, eh?

05:01.525 --> 05:02.365
[nurse sighs]

05:02.445 --> 05:04.525
[Tony] <i>My dad's completely gone now.</i>

05:04.765 --> 05:06.485
I feel bad that I resent

05:07.125 --> 05:08.685
having to visit him every day,

05:08.765 --> 05:10.765
but I know I'd feel bad
if I didn't visit every day.

05:10.845 --> 05:12.445
And then when I do visit him every day,

05:12.525 --> 05:15.245
I feel bad when I leave
'cause it was so depressing.

05:15.525 --> 05:18.565
I know I'm not thinking straight,
but I don't wanna think straight

05:18.645 --> 05:21.925
'cause when I do, I get even more
fucking depressed because...

05:22.645 --> 05:23.605
I just wanna sleep.

05:24.605 --> 05:25.765
You know, I haven't...

05:26.445 --> 05:27.725
Sorry, am I boring you?

05:28.445 --> 05:32.445
I just got into an argument on Twitter
with some absolute moron medical student.

05:32.525 --> 05:34.725
Now he's decided to block me
'cause he couldn't take it.

05:34.965 --> 05:35.805
[scoffs]

05:36.325 --> 05:37.445
It's pathetic.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.245
It is, yeah.

05:39.365 --> 05:41.685
[therapist scoffs] I'd love to meet him.

05:42.245 --> 05:43.085
Yeah?

05:43.165 --> 05:45.565
And fucking give him a good hiding.
[chuckles]

05:48.045 --> 05:50.045
[melancholy piano]

05:55.605 --> 05:57.085
[Tony] Off to buy some smack?

05:57.405 --> 05:58.245
Yep.

05:58.485 --> 06:00.045
How much do you get for that then?

06:00.645 --> 06:01.925
Er, just, um...

06:02.005 --> 06:03.165
It's like a little bag.

06:04.645 --> 06:05.925
I might join you one day.

06:07.525 --> 06:08.765
Yeah, anytime.

06:08.845 --> 06:09.685
Tonight?

06:10.725 --> 06:11.765
Er...

06:11.845 --> 06:12.685
How do you mean?

06:12.885 --> 06:14.285
I wanna try heroin tonight.

06:15.605 --> 06:16.885
What, you? Really?

06:16.965 --> 06:17.805
Yeah.

06:18.405 --> 06:19.525
Why not? Fuck it.

06:21.445 --> 06:22.525
How much for one try?

06:23.005 --> 06:24.325
Erm...

06:24.405 --> 06:25.325
One try, one hit.

06:25.405 --> 06:26.685
What do you want exactly?

06:27.045 --> 06:28.045
Not injecting it.

06:28.645 --> 06:31.965
I can't stand needles.
Also AIDS. I don't wanna die of that.

06:32.045 --> 06:33.845
You only get AIDS if you share needles.

06:33.925 --> 06:36.245
Anyway, these days,
you don't really die of it, so--

06:36.325 --> 06:38.605
So, everything moves on, don't it?

06:39.525 --> 06:40.405
Even AIDS.

06:42.045 --> 06:44.805
Yeah, it's probably best
if you smoke a bit in a joint.

06:44.885 --> 06:45.765
It's no big deal.

-Yep.

07:02.405 --> 07:04.405
-Do you know where I live?
-Yeah.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.445
And keep it...

07:07.485 --> 07:08.965
-All right?
-Okay.

07:20.725 --> 07:22.645
-You ready, Jabba?
-One minute.

07:34.765 --> 07:37.045
You get a lovely little handful
of his neck.

07:37.845 --> 07:38.685

07:41.045 --> 07:41.965
[Braden] You all right?

07:43.725 --> 07:44.765
How's it going?

07:44.845 --> 07:48.725
I'm still alone, angry, in pain.
I can't wait to end it all. You?

07:49.685 --> 07:50.565
I'm fine, thanks.

07:51.085 --> 07:53.645
If you're not killing yourself tonight,
still okay to look after George?

07:53.725 --> 07:55.805
Yeah. What time did we say?

07:55.885 --> 07:57.205
Er, about five.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.765
I've got a thing with Jill. Only be
a couple of hours. We'll be back by seven.

08:00.845 --> 08:02.325
Seven? By seven?

08:02.405 --> 08:04.365
I need to... I've got a thing at seven.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.085
Yeah.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.125
-Okay.
-What were you doing with his neck?

08:09.925 --> 08:12.245
Just showing Sandy the ropes.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.285
The consistency,

08:13.365 --> 08:15.205
which is not like neck at all.

08:15.285 --> 08:18.645
-It's more like breast or scrotum.
-Well, you're not touching <i>them.</i>

08:19.605 --> 08:21.885
-You all right with that?
-Yeah, fine. [sighs]

08:21.965 --> 08:22.805
[Tony] He's nodding.

08:24.165 --> 08:25.605
-You all right with that?
-Yeah.

08:25.685 --> 08:27.805
Why wouldn't she be all right
with me grabbing his neck?

08:27.885 --> 08:30.045
These days, it's a minefield.

08:31.045 --> 08:34.005
-Are you gonna do that story?
-Yeah, we're off to do it now. Come on.

08:35.605 --> 08:37.645
Is that how you were carried around
when you were young?

08:40.245 --> 08:42.125
-[Tony] See ya later.
-[Lenny] See ya.

08:42.205 --> 08:43.325

09:17.125 --> 09:19.885

09:19.965 --> 09:20.965

-[Tony] Yeah. Cool.

-No?
-No. So I've got lots of time. [chuckles]

09:29.805 --> 09:31.005
Use it wisely.

this morning, I was thinking

09:34.165 --> 09:38.205
my life was worthless, and I should
definitely kill myself, and then...

[indistinct dialog]

10:09.925 --> 10:11.045
That was funny.

10:11.685 --> 10:12.765
Was it, though?

10:13.325 --> 10:16.405
A fat kid who still lives at home
with his mum, no job,

10:16.485 --> 10:19.565
so he shoves recorders up his nose
and he wants the world to know.

10:19.845 --> 10:22.765
Why would people rather be famous
for being shit than not famous at all?

10:22.845 --> 10:23.805
When did that start?

10:23.885 --> 10:25.845
It's just a bit of a laugh.
We do these stories

10:25.925 --> 10:28.245
so people read them and go,
"Oh, that's interesting."

10:28.925 --> 10:30.005
Like a road accident.

on the motorway, you go,

Oh, I wish I hadn't looked."

-Asking if I could call her.

10:44.525 --> 10:46.405
-Why?
-What do you mean, "why?"

10:46.725 --> 10:48.965
-Why would you need to call her?
-For a date.

10:49.445 --> 10:51.205
You asked the fat kid's mum out on a date?

10:51.285 --> 10:52.245
Yeah.

10:52.325 --> 10:53.885
-[Tony] Unbelievable.
-Why?

10:54.445 --> 10:55.885
[Tony] Unprofessional. Embarrassing.

10:56.045 --> 10:56.885
For who?

10:57.085 --> 10:58.925
For me, for her, probably.

10:59.005 --> 11:00.165
Well, she said yes.

11:00.245 --> 11:03.325
[Tony] Seems odd. You meet a woman
who wants to get her fat kid in the paper,

11:03.405 --> 11:04.805
and you hit on her immediately.

11:04.885 --> 11:06.525
I've got a very high sex drive.

Nah, we're done for.

It's stopping.

-All right?
-[Sandy] Hi.

11:34.325 --> 11:35.645
[Kath sighs]

11:38.485 --> 11:39.685
Do you have weird dreams?

11:40.965 --> 11:41.805
[Sandy] Um...

11:42.805 --> 11:44.205
-Sometimes.
-[Kath] Mmm.

11:44.285 --> 11:45.125
Yeah.

11:46.685 --> 11:47.765
What about you?

11:47.845 --> 11:50.405
I don't have any dreams at the moment
'cause I'm not sleeping.

11:50.485 --> 11:53.045
But even if I did,
I wouldn't tell them to anyone

11:53.125 --> 11:56.765
because there is nothing more boring
than someone telling you a dream they had.

11:57.205 --> 11:58.605
See what you think of this then.

11:59.125 --> 12:01.765
-She's gonna tell us anyway.
-[Kath] I was looking in the mirror,

12:02.405 --> 12:04.325
and I looked really weird

12:04.405 --> 12:05.925
and I could pull my hair out.

12:06.005 --> 12:06.845
I know how you feel.

12:06.925 --> 12:07.805
And...

12:08.165 --> 12:10.365
So I tried my teeth,
and my teeth were loose,

12:10.765 --> 12:13.125
but then, it wasn't me, it was a baby.

12:13.285 --> 12:14.685
What the hell does that mean?

12:14.765 --> 12:17.605
Wow. You had that dream with the baby
and the teeth and the hair?

12:17.685 --> 12:20.485
-Mmm.
-Wow, I don't know if it was Freud or Jung

12:20.565 --> 12:23.085
that said if you have that dream
and tell other people about it,

12:23.165 --> 12:24.485
you're really fucking boring.

12:24.965 --> 12:25.805
Rude.

12:27.165 --> 12:29.005
Make a good column, though,
wouldn't it, dreams?

12:29.085 --> 12:31.925
[Tony] No. I tell you what would be good.
I haven't been sleeping,

12:32.005 --> 12:35.125
so if you could come around every night
and talk to me for five minutes,

12:35.205 --> 12:37.645
and then sneak out as I slip into a coma,

12:37.885 --> 12:39.685
that'd be really good.

12:40.045 --> 12:42.365
[Kath] Thought of another feature
for the paper, actually.

12:42.605 --> 12:44.445
Fantasy dinner-party guests.

12:45.005 --> 12:47.965
Brilliant, eh? Pick your top five
favorite people, and why.

12:48.045 --> 12:49.165
Why, indeed.

12:49.245 --> 12:51.365
Who would yours be?
Five people, dead or alive.

12:51.445 --> 12:52.325
Dead.

12:52.565 --> 12:54.645
-Who, though?
-Doesn't matter, as long as they're dead.

12:54.725 --> 12:56.125
[sighing] I know mine.

12:56.205 --> 12:58.245
-[Tony] Of course you do.
-Number one, James Corden.

12:58.325 --> 13:00.645
-Fuck me.
-We could do that <i>Carpool Karaoke.</i>

13:00.725 --> 13:02.245
Could you do Carpool Kamikaze?

13:02.325 --> 13:03.765
That man can do anything.

13:03.845 --> 13:06.205
-And does.
-I know the cool kids don't like him,

13:06.285 --> 13:07.765
but he never stops working.

13:07.845 --> 13:10.525
-As a chauffeur, mainly.
-He's a grafter, like me.

13:10.925 --> 13:12.485
-Princess Diana.
-[snorts]

13:12.645 --> 13:14.685
She'd know how she died.
You know, what happened.

13:14.765 --> 13:17.085
So we'd be able to sort that out,
once and for all.

13:17.165 --> 13:19.805
So you've brought this poor woman
back to life

13:19.885 --> 13:21.845
so you can quiz her about how she died?

13:21.925 --> 13:24.965
The dead always want to tell their story
so they can be at peace.

13:25.045 --> 13:27.885
She's not at peace. She's in a room
with you and James fuckin' Corden.

13:27.965 --> 13:29.325
-Mr. Bean.
-Fictional.

13:29.405 --> 13:30.605
Hilarious, more like.

13:30.685 --> 13:34.085
You've invited multimillionaire
Rowan Atkinson, right,

13:34.165 --> 13:38.085
along to a dinner party with you,
a dead woman, and James Corden,

13:38.365 --> 13:39.885
and you expect him to stay in character

13:39.965 --> 13:42.445
for three hours as Mr. fuckin' Bean?

13:42.845 --> 13:44.285
It's up to me who I invite.

13:46.645 --> 13:47.485
Kevin Hart,

13:47.725 --> 13:49.085
funniest man in the world.

13:49.445 --> 13:51.285
-That's four, isn't it?
-Yeah.

13:51.365 --> 13:53.125
-Michael Jackson.
-[Tony scoffs]

13:54.125 --> 13:56.845
James Corden would come
if Jacko walked in.

13:56.925 --> 13:58.965
Just fuckin' drench everyone.

13:59.485 --> 14:00.605
You need to grow up.

14:02.525 --> 14:04.805
Worst dinner party ever.

14:07.685 --> 14:08.685
[sighing] Oh, good.

14:10.005 --> 14:11.005
Busy?

14:11.365 --> 14:12.205
Trying to be.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.685
It doesn't look like you are.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.085
Watching her bothering us
while we're trying to work?

14:16.165 --> 14:17.845
Can you do what I asked you to do, please?

14:17.925 --> 14:19.285
You're meant to be teaching Sandy--

14:19.365 --> 14:20.565
She's learning a lot.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.005
Please.

14:30.765 --> 14:32.205
Right, it's going. Come on.

14:32.285 --> 14:33.725
-No, come on.
-Yeah.

14:33.965 --> 14:36.765
-This is stupid. You're gonna get hurt.
-Why?

14:36.845 --> 14:38.765
-Because you're old!
-I'm not old.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.965
-[Lisa] I'm old. Look, I'm drunk.
-Come on.

14:41.045 --> 14:43.285
-I know, but that's good if you're drunk.
-No, it's stupid.

14:43.365 --> 14:45.485
Drunk people, they sort of bounce.
All right, come on.

14:45.565 --> 14:48.445
If I fall on you,
I'm not taking you to A&E.

14:48.525 --> 14:50.765
-[Tony] No. Okay.
-Right, go. Go.<i> </i>[laughing]

14:50.845 --> 14:52.205
Stupid thing!

14:52.285 --> 14:53.725
-[whooping] I'm flying!
-[Tony whoops]

14:53.805 --> 14:55.405
[Tony laughing loudly]

14:55.485 --> 14:56.525
Yes!

14:56.605 --> 14:58.805
[Tony] Let go, sweetie. Let go.

14:58.885 --> 15:02.045
-[Tony] Whoa! Argh! [laughing]
-[Lisa laughing hysterically]

15:03.525 --> 15:04.845
[keyboard clacking]

15:08.645 --> 15:11.645
So what sort of journalism
are you interested in?

15:12.365 --> 15:13.845
You don't have to babysit me.

15:15.045 --> 15:16.445
I'm happy to just sit here.

15:18.005 --> 15:19.165
I like peace and quiet.

15:19.765 --> 15:22.645
I live at home with my mum,
dad, brother and sister, so...

15:23.165 --> 15:25.005
the house can be quite full of life.

15:26.005 --> 15:27.405
-[Sandy sighs]
-What?

15:27.845 --> 15:28.685
[quietly] I'm sorry.

15:28.765 --> 15:30.205
What? What's the matter?

15:32.245 --> 15:33.085
You're sad.

15:33.845 --> 15:34.925
It's fine, seriously.

15:35.925 --> 15:38.605
I was married for 25 years.
It was brilliant.

15:39.485 --> 15:41.285
Now it's over. It's not your problem.

15:42.405 --> 15:43.965
-Did you not want any kids?
-No.

15:44.965 --> 15:48.445
-Annoying little fuckers.
-[laughs and sighs]

15:49.365 --> 15:50.245
[inhales sharply]

15:50.325 --> 15:51.965
You can still be happy.

15:52.045 --> 15:53.525
[whispering] I'll try, but stop crying

15:53.605 --> 15:55.565
because people will think
I said something awful.

15:55.645 --> 15:57.485
-Okay.
-[whispering] Okay. Shhhh.

15:58.245 --> 16:01.605
See, this is why I don't want kids.
They're too snotty and pathetic.

16:01.685 --> 16:02.925
[Sandy laughs]

16:03.485 --> 16:04.485
Oh!

16:04.565 --> 16:05.965
I think he's gonna eat. Watch this.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.885
-He told you to watch me eat, didn't he?
-Yeah.

16:30.525 --> 16:32.205
-Thoughts?
-It's fine.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.485
No, exactly. I put the food in my gob,

16:35.565 --> 16:37.725
I chew it, I swallow it,
just like everyone else.

16:37.805 --> 16:40.725
But from here,
it looks like that super photography

16:40.805 --> 16:45.805
when they sort of magnify a snail,
like one thousand times, eating a cabbage.

16:45.885 --> 16:48.765
No, nothing like that.
You'd never catch me eating cabbages.

16:48.845 --> 16:50.765
My granddad never used to eat cabbages.

16:50.845 --> 16:53.325
Did he die of diabetes like he's gonna?

16:53.405 --> 16:54.485
No, bowel cancer.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.805
Do you get <i>any</i> fiber in your diet?

16:58.885 --> 16:59.845
Yeah, loads.

16:59.925 --> 17:02.045
-What fruit and veg?
-Meant to have five a day.

17:02.165 --> 17:03.885
How many portions do you have a day?

17:03.965 --> 17:05.285
-Ten.
-Potatoes don't count.

17:05.365 --> 17:06.485
None, then.

17:23.645 --> 17:25.725
-[air horn hoots]
-[Lisa screams]

17:25.805 --> 17:28.765
-[Tony laughing hysterically]
<i>-Oh, my God, Tony!</i> [laughs]

17:29.725 --> 17:32.565
-<i>You're such a dick!</i>
-[Tony laughing] <i>Oh!</i>

17:32.925 --> 17:34.285
<i>-That's really good.</i>
-[Lisa] <i>Thanks.</i>

17:34.365 --> 17:35.845
[Tony]<i> I like to think that I helped--</i>

17:35.925 --> 17:37.805
-[Lisa] <i>Yeah, that bit.</i>
-[Tony laughing]

17:37.885 --> 17:39.725
-[Lisa] <i>You can sign that bit.</i>
-[doorbell rings]

17:39.805 --> 17:41.805
<i>Yeah, where I jumped.</i>

17:47.485 --> 17:49.965
-[Braden] Hey. You all right?
-Good. All right, George?

17:50.205 --> 17:53.165
-So I'll be back about seven.
-Make sure it's seven. I've got a thing.

17:53.245 --> 17:55.165
-Okay, no worries. See you then.
-Yep.

17:55.525 --> 17:56.965
Be a good boy for Uncle Tony, George!

17:58.685 --> 18:02.245
Um, maybe don't bring up
the wanting to kill yourself thing.

18:03.445 --> 18:04.325
As if I would.

18:04.845 --> 18:06.725
Sorry. Yeah, I know. Okay.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.205
What if he brings it up?

18:10.565 --> 18:11.645
Why would he bring it up?

18:12.725 --> 18:13.565
He wouldn't.

18:14.045 --> 18:15.005
It was a joke.

18:15.085 --> 18:16.125
Oh. [laughs feebly]

18:17.485 --> 18:19.165
-All right, see ya later.
-See ya later.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.565
Do you want a drink?

18:25.645 --> 18:26.685
Yes, please.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.165
-Whiskey?
-[chuckles]

18:35.165 --> 18:36.365
And we've got-- Oh.

18:37.565 --> 18:38.405
Coke?

18:38.485 --> 18:39.925
[can opening]

18:41.765 --> 18:43.245
[Tony sighs]

18:45.325 --> 18:47.965
Daddy says you're sad
since Auntie Lisa died.

18:48.765 --> 18:49.605
Yep.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.085
I'm sad too.

18:51.805 --> 18:53.805
I dream about her sometimes.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.165
Me too.

18:56.245 --> 18:58.205
Why didn't the doctors make her better?

19:00.165 --> 19:01.005
They tried.

19:01.805 --> 19:03.445
Why didn't Jesus save her?

19:03.525 --> 19:05.005
'Cause he's an arsehole.

19:05.085 --> 19:06.045
[laughs]

19:06.125 --> 19:08.645
-Don't tell your mum and dad I said that.
-I won't.

19:09.645 --> 19:11.205
-You had your tea?
-No.

19:11.845 --> 19:13.325
-Hungry?
-Yeah.

19:14.325 --> 19:15.525
Shall we go to the cafe?

19:16.125 --> 19:18.365
-[George] Yeah.
-Yeah. Come on then.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.365
-You got any money?
-No.

19:22.445 --> 19:23.725
Loser. [clears throat]

19:27.125 --> 19:29.205
[Tony] What do you fancy?
-[George] Mmm...

19:29.685 --> 19:31.285
Fish fingers and beans.

19:31.365 --> 19:32.205
Good choice.

19:32.925 --> 19:34.125
Think I'll have that.

19:35.165 --> 19:38.325
-What can I get for ya?
-We're having the fish fingers and beans.

19:38.565 --> 19:40.485
That's only on the children's menu,
I'm afraid.

19:40.565 --> 19:42.205
Yeah, I'm not very hungry.

19:42.485 --> 19:43.885
I can't let you order that.

19:44.605 --> 19:45.445
What do you mean?

19:46.125 --> 19:47.405
It's for children. [laughs]

19:47.725 --> 19:49.885
But... I can eat what children eat,
can't I?

19:49.965 --> 19:51.365
Yeah, but it's only £4.99.

19:51.765 --> 19:53.885
Yeah, I know,
'cause it's a smaller portion.

19:54.765 --> 19:56.285
I'm paying child's prices,

19:56.365 --> 19:58.205
but I'm getting a children's portion.

19:59.005 --> 20:01.485
Yeah, but we made it cheaper
'cause it's for kids.

20:01.925 --> 20:04.925
I know, 'cause they're smaller.
It's<i> </i>smaller 'cause they're smaller.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.005
It's not a concession.

20:06.085 --> 20:09.405
It's not 'cause they're unemployed, is it?
And also, an adult's paying, so--

20:09.485 --> 20:10.485
It's the rules.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.645
-Is it?
-Mmm.

20:14.245 --> 20:15.085
Right.

20:15.645 --> 20:18.045
Well, he'll have fish fingers and beans...

20:18.125 --> 20:19.125
twice.

20:20.885 --> 20:23.005
-You'll just eat one of them, won't ya?
-Nah.

20:23.525 --> 20:24.605
So what are you ordering?

20:24.685 --> 20:27.045
As I say, I'm not very hungry,
so I'll just get a coffee.

20:28.725 --> 20:29.605
[scoffs]

20:32.725 --> 20:33.805
Both for him, are they?

20:42.245 --> 20:43.525
-That good?
-Mm.

20:48.405 --> 20:49.445
Mmm.

21:04.685 --> 21:06.125
[under breath] Fuckin' 'ell.

21:06.205 --> 21:07.965
[quietly] Where's your fuckin' dad?

21:09.245 --> 21:11.205
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh. Oh, no.

21:11.285 --> 21:13.605
Please don't be Julian.
Please don't be Julian.

21:15.245 --> 21:16.125
Yes!

21:17.725 --> 21:19.365
-George!
-I'm sorry, um...

21:19.445 --> 21:21.085
[Tony] That's all right. See ya later.

21:21.165 --> 21:22.725
-Cheers.
[Braden] There he is. All right?

21:23.125 --> 21:24.245
-See you tomorrow.
-All right?

21:24.325 --> 21:25.245
-Yeah, good.
-Yeah?

21:25.325 --> 21:27.845
-Did you have a good time?
-Yeah, good. Off you-- Fuck.

21:28.325 --> 21:30.485
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Because...

21:30.925 --> 21:33.845
he's come around to talk about
getting started on the paper.

21:35.005 --> 21:36.245
-Not this.
-Oh, right.

21:36.325 --> 21:37.405
-Great.
-Exactly.

21:37.685 --> 21:39.125
-Right.
-Got a takeaway?

21:39.285 --> 21:40.125
It's drugs.

21:40.205 --> 21:41.685
-You don't need to answer.
-What?
