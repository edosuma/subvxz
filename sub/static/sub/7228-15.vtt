[Doc reading]

00:59.559 --> 01:00.769
Okay, campers.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.353
Who loves
the great outdoors?

01:02.437 --> 01:03.438
I do!

01:03.521 --> 01:04.688
Me, too!

01:05.315 --> 01:08.193
We need a good place
to camp for the night.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.821
What about right here?

01:12.781 --> 01:13.656
Good eye, Doc.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.450
I'll put up the tent.

[grunting]

01:26.503 --> 01:27.504
Whoa!

01:27.587 --> 01:30.465
[laughs]
Um, need any help, Dad?

01:31.132 --> 01:32.258
Nope. Got it.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.676
I think.

01:34.093 --> 01:37.680
But, Doc, maybe you can
gather some sticks
to start the campfire.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.015
Okay.

01:39.098 --> 01:42.018
You know the drill:
stay where
I can see you,

01:42.101 --> 01:44.562
don't touch anything
creepy or crawly,

01:44.646 --> 01:46.481
call me
if you need help.

01:46.898 --> 01:47.732
You got it!

01:48.525 --> 01:50.401
Well, this looks--

01:50.610 --> 01:51.444
[groans]

01:51.945 --> 01:53.196
Um, Dad?

01:53.279 --> 01:55.406
Call me
if you need any help.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.574
[Dad chuckles]

01:57.158 --> 01:58.118
Here, Doc.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.577
Take Robot Ray
with you.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.579
If you get
in trouble...

02:01.663 --> 02:03.957
[both] Robot Ray
will save the day!

02:04.624 --> 02:05.583
Thanks, Donny.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.502
I'll take
good care of him.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.586
[clatter]
[Dad] Uh, Donny?

02:10.713 --> 02:13.424
[chuckles]
I need a little help
after all.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.051
Oh, Dad.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.138
Donny to the rescue!

02:31.234 --> 02:32.485
-Hi, there!
-Hiya, Doc!

02:32.569 --> 02:36.447
Okay, toys, who's ready
to help me find sticks
for the campfire?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.616
Sounds good!
Me, me!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.535
I'm ready for anything
in the woods.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.787
I'm wearing
my brand-new scarf

02:42.871 --> 02:44.330
just for this occasion!

02:44.747 --> 02:47.333
Ooh! It's perfect
on you, Lambie!

02:47.750 --> 02:50.962
It's a well-known fact
that dragons love the woods!

02:51.045 --> 02:52.130
[sniffs]

02:52.213 --> 02:53.965
Ahh! The fresh air.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.134

02:56.801 --> 02:57.760
The spiders.

02:57.844 --> 02:58.803
Aah! Spider!

02:58.887 --> 03:00.805
No one told me the woods
would have spiders!

03:00.889 --> 03:04.267
Spiders, worms,
and all kinds of animals.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.687
[gasps] Animals?
You mean, wild beasts?

03:07.770 --> 03:08.897
Do not fear.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.775
Robot Ray
will scare away
any wild beasts.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.825
[alarm blares]
Halt!
Who goes there?

03:21.534 --> 03:24.245
Um, excuse me?

03:24.746 --> 03:27.707
Mmm. My apologies,
wooly friend.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.000
Aah!

03:29.876 --> 03:31.294
Apology accepted.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.921
How about a cuddle?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.091
-Ahh.
-Mmm.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.928
Robot Ray, thanks
for looking after us,

03:40.011 --> 03:41.679

05:00.717 --> 05:01.634
Sorry, buddy.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.762
[Doc] Oh, no.
Are you okay?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.723
Hmm. Good question, Doc.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.766

Commencing systems check.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.436
[revving]

05:11.894 --> 05:12.812
Affirmative!

05:12.895 --> 05:14.814
Robot Ray
seems to be working.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.900
Something is wrong.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.402
Malfunction!

05:19.485 --> 05:22.071
Oh, no.
What do we do, Doc?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.033
Hmm.
I've seen this before.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.619
Robot Ray's
sticky launcher
is broken.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.080
He must have
sticky-launcher-itis!

05:31.497 --> 05:33.249
Can you fix it, Doc?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.876
Can she fix it?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.170
She's the great
Doc McStuffins.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.589
Of course she can fix it!
Right, Doc?

05:39.964 --> 05:42.842
Actually, I can't
fix it right now.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.385
We're in the middle
of the woods,

05:44.469 --> 05:48.639
and the paste I need
to fix Ray's arm
is back in the clinic.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.224
I'm sorry, Robot Ray.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.894
Oh, poor Robot Ray!

05:53.436 --> 05:54.562
[sighs]

05:54.645 --> 05:58.107
I'll never rescue again!

05:58.441 --> 06:01.778
No, no. I just can't
fix him right now.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.322
See, I may not have
my doctor's bag,

06:04.405 --> 06:06.616
but I do have
my first-aid kit!

06:07.033 --> 06:09.994
Oh, well,
why didn't you say so?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.747
So what's
a first-aid kit again?

06:13.414 --> 06:17.126
Well, when someone's hurt
and can't get
to a hospital quickly,

06:17.210 --> 06:19.712
we use first-aid
to make them feel better.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.758
That's why I always take
a first-aid kit with me
when we go away.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.595
Wait a second, Doc.
You're saying a doctor
can help a boo-boo

06:27.678 --> 06:29.472
with just this
little bitty kit?

06:29.847 --> 06:31.891
Yup!
And not just doctors.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.227
Anyone who learns how
can use first-aid.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.812
Hmm. What's in it?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.773
Oh, I see! Huh.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.610
It's got, uh,
bandages, tweezers--

06:42.693 --> 06:44.987
ooh, and cottony wrap.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.155
That's right!

06:46.239 --> 06:49.408
And we can use the stuff
we find around us, too.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.161
Please begin
first-aid sequence.

06:52.245 --> 06:56.332
Robot Ray is feeling,
uh... strange.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.919
Don't worry, Ray.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.755
I think you might
just be a bit nervous.

07:03.381 --> 07:07.009
The first part of first-aid
is calming your patient.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.929
Try to think of something
that makes you happy.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.098
It'll take your mind
off your arm.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.477
Well, rescuing
makes me happy.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.312
[barking]
Aah, aah, aah!

07:18.855 --> 07:22.316
Stay away from my friend,
fur-beast!

07:23.568 --> 07:25.153
[cheering]

07:26.279 --> 07:29.657
Wow! That was
a happy thought!

07:30.199 --> 07:32.577
See that?
You're starting
to calm down.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.746
Now, Stuffy,
I need you
to find a stick

07:35.830 --> 07:37.540
about as long
as Ray's arm.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.250
On it!
[panting]

07:39.959 --> 07:40.877
Huh?

07:42.503 --> 07:43.504
One sec.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.381
[groaning]

07:46.174 --> 07:47.842
Okay. Two secs.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.594
Coming right up.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.263
What?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.932
Oh. Thank you.
Here I come!

07:55.016 --> 07:56.809
And I found
the perfect stick!

07:56.893 --> 07:58.227
Ahem!

07:59.061 --> 08:01.439
What? Oh, and by I,

08:01.522 --> 08:03.399
uh, I mean--
[chuckles]

08:03.483 --> 08:05.026
I couldn't have done it
without Lambie.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.528
Great work,
you guys.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.907
Now I need you
to hold it up
against Ray's arm.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.576
Sure!
What's it for, Doc?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.745
We're making something
called a splint.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.664
It'll hold Ray's arm still
till we get him
back to the clinic.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.042
Now who's got
the first-aid kit?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.418
I have it, Doc!

08:22.835 --> 08:25.755
Thanks, Lambie.
There should be some
white bandages in there.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.841
Can you find them
for me?
Oh, here they are!

08:28.925 --> 08:32.135
Mmm. Soft, like me.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.847
Now, Ray,
Stuffy and I are gonna
hold the splint

08:35.932 --> 08:38.058
while Lambie
wraps this bandage
around your arm.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.394
Tell us if it's
too tight, okay?

08:40.852 --> 08:42.104
Affirmative.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.898
Here we go!

08:49.445 --> 08:51.948
Okay, Robot Ray.
Your splint
is secure.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.324
How does it feel?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.326
Not too tight.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.578
It fits just right!

08:57.662 --> 08:59.330
That's what
I like to hear!

09:00.164 --> 09:03.209
Malfunction.
Arm is heavy!

09:03.292 --> 09:05.127
Can't lift it up.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.922
Oh. I know
what Ray needs.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.466
Lambie,
can I borrow
your scarf?

09:10.841 --> 09:12.468
Yeah. Um, Doc?

09:12.969 --> 09:16.264
Is this really
the best time
for a fashion show?

09:16.556 --> 09:19.392
[chuckles] No.
I need it
for Robot Ray.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.646
Oh. [laughs] Well,
anything to help a friend!

09:24.564 --> 09:25.982
This is a sling.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.608
It'll hold Ray's
arm up

09:27.692 --> 09:29.777
so he doesn't have
to do it himself.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.112
Try it out, Ray.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.575
Success! My arm is secure.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.868
And tomorrow
when we're at my clinic,

09:37.952 --> 09:39.078
I'll fix you for good.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.455
[Donny] Doc!
Hey, Doc!

09:41.539 --> 09:43.082
[Doc gasps]
Here comes Donny.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.750
Toys, go stuffed!

09:45.209 --> 09:47.712
Dad finally
set up the tent!

09:48.004 --> 09:50.381
Now he's ready
to start the campfire.

09:50.756 --> 09:54.677
Um, Donny,
I have some bad news.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.722
Robot Ray got birdnapped
by a bluebird!

09:58.306 --> 10:00.558
He fell out of a tree
and broke his arm.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.809
What?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.436
Poor Robot Ray!

10:03.811 --> 10:05.813
I fixed him as best
I could for now,

10:06.397 --> 10:08.733
but I'll paste his arm
when we get home.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.193
I'm sorry Ray got hurt.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.738
It's okay.
I know you can fix him!

10:14.196 --> 10:16.949
Doc, Donny!
I'm gonna cook dinner,

10:17.033 --> 10:19.660
then we'll roast
marshmallows!

10:19.744 --> 10:22.204
Marshmallows?
Awesome!

10:23.122 --> 10:24.582
We're bringing
the sticks!

10:29.086 --> 10:33.799
Doc, are you sure my arm
will be all better someday?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.217
[robot voice]
Affirmative!

10:35.301 --> 10:37.595
[toys laughing]

10:42.642 --> 10:43.976
Now let's go.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.148
[Doc] Almost done,
Robot Ray!

10:49.231 --> 10:52.109
Just hold still
for one minute longer.

10:52.526 --> 10:55.655
I will be still
as a moon rock.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.615
Oh, you poor
little dear!

10:57.698 --> 11:00.242
I'm pleased as a junebug
you're home with us,

11:00.326 --> 11:03.579
but I'm really glad
Doc had a first-aid
kit with her.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.291
And that's why
everyone should keep
a first-aid kit handy.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.834
Even lambs!

11:09.126 --> 11:10.920
And dragons!
Right, Doc?

11:11.295 --> 11:14.757
Right! Okay, Ray.
The paste is dry.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.134
Go ahead
and test out your arm.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.886
Here goes.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.222
I hope this works.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.184
It's-- It's all better!

11:25.726 --> 11:28.687
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I feel better</span>

11:43.285 --> 11:46.831
Robot Ray
can save the day again!

11:46.914 --> 11:49.166
Aw, nobody needs
any rescuing here.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.459
[chirping]

11:50.835 --> 11:53.879
Caution! Another
flying blue beast!

11:53.963 --> 11:56.424
Oh, no, Ray,
that's just a cute
little birdie!

11:56.507 --> 11:58.008
Rescue sequence go!

11:58.676 --> 11:59.677
Uh-oh. Aah!

12:00.636 --> 12:01.512
Whoa!

12:01.595 --> 12:03.597
You saved Stuffy!

12:03.681 --> 12:05.349
You're our hero!

12:05.641 --> 12:07.309
It was nothing.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.729
Doc McStuffins,
you're the real hero!

12:11.188 --> 12:12.940
Aww!
[laughing]

12:15.901 --> 12:17.611
[Doc reading]

12:21.490 --> 12:22.783
Hi, Doc!
Hello, there!

12:22.867 --> 12:23.826
Hello, there.
Hiya!

12:23.909 --> 12:25.244
Hi, guys!

12:25.327 --> 12:28.706
Well, you seem happier
than a hippo
in a hoop skirt.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.041
Let me tell you,
that's pretty happy.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.626
I had a great day!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.254
My mom
took Donny and me
to the aquarium.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.047
It was so cool.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.757
Ah. The aquarium, huh?

12:38.841 --> 12:40.926
My old stomping grounds.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.303
What did you see?

12:42.678 --> 12:44.847
Jellyfish and-- and sharks,

12:44.930 --> 12:47.391
and the prettiest
purple starfish.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.602
I remember
that starfish.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.270
She was a looker!

12:51.645 --> 12:52.855
I miss the old 'hood.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.690
Course,
I'm glad I'm here.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.026
I still remember
when you got me, Doc.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.112
I was sitting right by
the cash register
in the gift shop.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.948
The gift shop!
I totally forgot.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.909
Mom got me
a new toy.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.035
Ooh!
Great news!

13:06.118 --> 13:07.244
A new toy?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.913
So where is
the latest and greatest?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.040
I left her
in the kitchen.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.375
Wait. What kind
of toy is it?

13:13.459 --> 13:15.169
A whale!
Be right back.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.505
Oh! How exciting!

13:17.588 --> 13:21.008
I don't think
I've had the pleasure
of meeting a whale before.

13:21.091 --> 13:25.387
Ahem. As a crab,
I know a thing or two
about water animals,

13:25.471 --> 13:27.473
and let me tell you,

13:27.556 --> 13:30.226
whales
are wicked big!

13:30.309 --> 13:31.810
Hope we have
enough room,

13:31.894 --> 13:33.729
or I'll have
to live outside.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.814
And when it gets hot,
I'll melt!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.942
This new toy
is the worst thing

13:38.025 --> 13:39.485
that's ever
happened to me.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.695
Oh, Chilly.
You can't melt.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.781
You're a stuffed animal,
remember?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.742
Ooh. Now that you
say it, I do.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.495
Sounds like this whale
is gonna be even bigger

13:49.578 --> 13:51.205
than Bronty
the Brontosaurus.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.916
I'd better get ready
for its new toy checkup.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.501
[Doc] Here we come!

13:55.584 --> 13:57.670
I hope they fit
in the front door.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.381
Everyone, close your eyes.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.093
No peeking!

14:05.135 --> 14:06.720
Who's peeking?

14:07.763 --> 14:09.682
Oh. Me.
That would be me.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.101
Yeah. [chuckles]
I'll stop now. Watch.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.937
Okay. You can
open your eyes now.

14:15.312 --> 14:19.066
Everyone, this is
Lula the beluga whale!

14:21.026 --> 14:21.944
Where is she?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.280
She's so big
she couldn't fit
in the door, right?

14:24.655 --> 14:25.906
[grunts] Hello?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.534
I don't see her.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.994
Hi. [giggles]

14:31.161 --> 14:34.123
That's Lula?
She's so small.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.834
Ow! I mean cute!
So cute!

14:38.878 --> 14:40.504
Welcome to Doc's clinic.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.173
We're always excited
to meet a new toy.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.967
I'm excited to be here.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.596
This place
is really cool.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.055
Thanks. We like it.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.809
A whale
smaller than I am?

14:54.351 --> 14:58.397
Wait till the wind-up toys
at the aquarium
hear about this!

14:59.481 --> 15:02.359
I know.
You were expecting me
to be bigger.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.863
Whales aren't
supposed to be so small.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.449
Toys come in all
shapes and sizes.

15:08.532 --> 15:12.411
Yeah. I mean,
we didn't think you
were going to be big!

15:12.494 --> 15:14.830
[Hallie] I got the biggest
blood pressure cuff

15:14.914 --> 15:16.916
and tongue depressor
I could find,

15:16.999 --> 15:20.794
so we can give
our new friend...
a whale of a checkup.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.256
Okay.
We thought you might be
a little bigger.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.510
I have never seen
such a small whale.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.305
Ugh. I know. I'm tiny.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.683
I don't like it,
but I won't be small
for long.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.478
I'm gonna grow
so big someday.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.604
I can't wait!

15:38.687 --> 15:40.064
Oh, I hate
to break it to you,

15:40.147 --> 15:42.274
but toys don't grow.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.903
I don't know
about other toys,
but I'm going to grow

15:45.986 --> 15:49.573
at least five times
the size I am now.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.326
Doc,
you'd better tell her.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.203
Actually,
Lula's right.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.454
She is gonna grow.

15:55.537 --> 15:59.875
Next thing you know,
you're gonna tell me
I'm not made of snow.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.711
[laughs]
Oh, Chilly.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.881
Look, Lula is
a special kind of toy.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.591
She's made out
of sponge,

16:07.675 --> 16:09.718
when we
put her in water,
she's gonna grow.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.929
Yeah. It says so
on my box.

16:12.012 --> 16:12.972
I'll show you.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.556
[grunting]

16:15.516 --> 16:17.768
Can I help you?

16:17.851 --> 16:20.437
No. I can do it myself.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.443
Ohh! I can't wait
till I'm bigger.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.654
Yeah. I guess
I do need your help.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.994
See? It says I'm gonna
get bigger right there.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.496
Can we get started,
Doc? Can we?

16:37.788 --> 16:41.500
I want to be big,
and I want to be big
right now.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.211
Hallie,
I need a... glass.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.879
How do you do that?

16:45.963 --> 16:47.673
A hippo always knows.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.467
Ready?
[Lula] So ready.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.095
I don't want to be
the smallest whale anymore.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.972
I'm off to the big time.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.100
Whoo! [laughs]
Here I grow!

16:59.643 --> 17:00.728
Ta-da!

17:03.063 --> 17:05.898
Hey, why is everyone
still so big,

17:06.275 --> 17:08.569
and why am I
still so small?

17:09.694 --> 17:12.156
I-- I didn't grow.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.491
No, you didn't.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.617
I'm sorry.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.163
Oh,
you need a cuddle.

17:20.664 --> 17:24.960
And right now,
you are the perfect
cuddling size.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.423
Thanks, Lambie.
[squeaking]

17:31.216 --> 17:34.011
Oh, don't worry.
No one understands
Squeakers.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.472
I do.
You speak squeak?

17:36.764 --> 17:39.433
I don't know,
but I sure do speak fish.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.643
[chattering]

17:43.020 --> 17:44.772
[squeaking]

17:46.482 --> 17:50.819
Aww. Squeakers
told me I'm perfect
just the way I am.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.696
-More than perfect!
-Smart fish.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.407
Lula, we love you
big or small.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.784
Thanks, Doc.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.577
That means a lot.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.330
I do think we should
give you a checkup

18:01.413 --> 18:03.791
to see why you're
not growing the way
you're supposed to.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.375
Hop on back,
little Lula.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.784
Lula, we should start
by checking how big
you are now.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.744
You stand up
against the wall,

18:40.828 --> 18:43.205
and Doc makes a line
at your highest point.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.458
[gasps] I'm shrinking!
I'm shrinking!

18:47.209 --> 18:48.961
Um, try this.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.005
Oh! I grew back.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.173
[chuckles]

18:53.257 --> 18:55.801
Okay, Lula.
It's your turn.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.972
There. That's how tall
you are now.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.641
I'll label this line
so we know it's yours.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.146
If we can figure out
how to make you grow,

19:07.229 --> 19:09.690
we'll mark your height
and see how much
taller you are.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.985
Everyone's
so much bigger than me.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.571
Lula, you're healthy,

19:15.654 --> 19:19.032
but you are small
for your kind of toy.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.035
I know,
and I don't like it.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.246
So why am I so small?

19:24.538 --> 19:25.956
I'm not sure.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.001
Sometimes even
the best doctors

19:29.084 --> 19:30.878
have to do
a little research

19:30.961 --> 19:33.005
to figure out
their hardest cases,

19:33.297 --> 19:36.675
and I have an idea
of how to learn
all about you.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.931
What's on there?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.516
Lula's instructions.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.852
If I read them,
I might learn something

19:46.935 --> 19:48.437
that'll explain
what's going on.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.523
[scoffs]
I never read instructions!

19:53.192 --> 19:55.527
I made this bike
without reading any.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.528
Check it out.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.280
Auugh!

19:58.572 --> 19:59.907
Oh, Stuffy.

20:00.782 --> 20:04.411
It says here you have
to wait in the water
before you grow.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.121
I have a diagnosis.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.208
Lula, you have
Wanna-be-big Syndrome,

20:09.875 --> 20:12.085
but as much
as you want to be big,

20:12.169 --> 20:15.422
you're just gonna have to wait
until your body is ready.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.758
I've never been so ready!

20:17.841 --> 20:21.511
I know, but you have
to spend more time
in the water.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.639
Aww. How long?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.140
A couple of hours.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.517
Come on!
What are we waiting for?

20:27.601 --> 20:29.978
Let's get swimming!

20:30.354 --> 20:31.813
Hallie, I need--
Water.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.190
Way ahead of you, Doc.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.608
You really are.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.944
Come on, come on.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.612
I want to get started!

20:39.363 --> 20:43.033
Whee!
I'm just gonna hang out
and wait to grow!

21:28.287 --> 21:30.789
Whoa!
Looking good, Lula.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.374
So is it working,
Doc?

21:32.874 --> 21:36.128
I think so, but let's do
a few tests to make sure.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.424
Need a hand getting out?
Nope. I can do it
all by myself.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.093
Whoo-hoo! Come on!
Come on! Hurry up!

21:43.176 --> 21:45.137
I want to know
how much bigger I am!

21:45.679 --> 21:47.389
That's my old line.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.099
Give me a new one, Doc!

21:49.182 --> 21:50.600
Hold still.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.772
I'm bigger.
[gasps] I'm bigger!

21:57.524 --> 22:00.027
I knew it was
too good to last.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.113
Ooh! Congrats, Lula.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.906
Oh,
I'm not done yet.

22:04.990 --> 22:05.949
What do you mean?

22:06.033 --> 22:09.453
I was thinking if I stay
in the water overnight

22:09.536 --> 22:12.622
I'd get to be
super extra big.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.542
We'd better get you
something bigger to wait in,

22:16.001 --> 22:17.502
something
you can grow into.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.546
You read my mind.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.306
I'll be back
in the morning.

22:29.639 --> 22:30.974
[Chilly]
I expect big things.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.351
Bye-bye!
See you guys tomorrow!

22:42.652 --> 22:44.279
Lula, honey?

22:45.113 --> 22:46.448
It's empty!
She's gone.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.451
No, she's not.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.704
Hi, guys!

22:53.246 --> 22:55.749
Wow. You did it!
You're so big.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.376
That a wicked big whale.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.920
Wicked big.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.300
I can't believe it.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.260
I've always wanted
to be big,

23:07.344 --> 23:08.929
and now I am!

23:14.684 --> 23:16.561
You look amazing,
Lula.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.480
I'm really happy
for you.

23:18.939 --> 23:19.940
Me, too!

23:20.398 --> 23:23.568
Being big was definitely
worth waiting for.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.154
Couldn't have done it
without you, Doc.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.615
A big thanks to you.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.909
Really big!

23:33.036 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.291
<span style="style.default_1">When you get tired</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and lose your energy,</span>

23:38.375 --> 23:39.543
<span style="style.default_1">what should you do?</span>

23:39.918 --> 23:42.546
<span style="style.default_1">Should you have a tea party...</span>

23:42.629 --> 23:44.047
[slurp]

23:44.422 --> 23:46.258
<span style="style.default_1">take a nap and recharge...</span>

23:48.301 --> 23:49.678
<span style="style.default_1">Or play basketball?</span>

23:49.761 --> 23:51.429
Whoa! Unh!

23:52.472 --> 23:54.307
<span style="style.default_1">That's right!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You should take a nap!</span>

23:56.101 --> 23:59.062
<span style="style.default_1">After you do,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you can zoom into action.</span>
