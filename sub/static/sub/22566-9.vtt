No!

Please fill these out.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.706
Do you have anyone here
with you?

21:13.806 --> 21:14.574
No.

21:14.674 --> 21:15.875
Do you want to call someone

21:15.975 --> 21:17.043
a friend or a relative

21:17.143 --> 21:18.578
to bring you home afterwards?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.347
I'll take a cab. I'll be fine.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.682
Are you sure?
You might have some discomfort.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.752
It's fine. I live close by.
I'll take a cab. Thanks.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.862
I'll be by your side
the entire time

21:35.962 --> 21:36.929
we're doing the procedure.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.298
- Okay.
- Are you cold?

21:39.399 --> 21:40.967
No, I'm fine.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.386
WOMEN'S CLINIC DOCTOR:
Okay.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.388
Here comes a cramp.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.622
Deep breath in...

SANDRA:
Okay.

Can I take a message?

22:33.352 --> 22:35.655
Can you please hold?

22:35.755 --> 22:38.090
Fox 5, CNN, Washington Post...

22:38.190 --> 22:41.060
They're all calling requesting
interviews. It's non-stop.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.829
Turn them down.
I'm not doing them.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.797
And set up meetings
with Robert Ackerman

22:44.897 --> 22:47.133

as soon as possible.

22:47.233 --> 22:49.502

23:19.065 --> 23:21.768
The Shaw story is on Fox.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.035
Thank you.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.875
SHAW:
...had on file
about Crescent Health

23:28.975 --> 23:30.042
and made
the rightful determination

23:30.142 --> 23:32.311
that because New York's lawsuit
was on behalf

23:32.411 --> 23:34.313
of all consumers nationwide

23:34.413 --> 23:36.449
no further action
need be taken.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.852
Let me reiterate
in the clearest possible terms.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.855
My office was never
investigating Crescent Health

23:42.955 --> 23:45.625
and I would never, under
any circumstances, take money

23:45.725 --> 23:48.761
in exchange for preferential
treatment of any kind.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.930
Any news story
that suggests otherwise

23:51.030 --> 23:52.965
is completely false.

Senator McCord

24:08.781 --> 24:11.618
within 48 hours,

24:11.718 --> 24:14.587
that he personally solicited
from a super PAC

24:14.687 --> 24:16.523
supporting that candidate.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.958
It doesn't get
any more clear than that.

24:19.058 --> 24:22.228
The people of Maryland
deserve to know the truth.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.564
Attorney General Shaw
needs to be held accountable

24:24.664 --> 24:26.398
for his gross abuse of power.

Period.
