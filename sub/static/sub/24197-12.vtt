10:29.931 --> 10:30.379
TESTOSTERONE.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.137

10:31.137 --> 10:33.137
ARE YOU DOING A VOICE OR IS THAT

10:33.137 --> 10:33.586
YOUR VOICE.

10:33.586 --> 10:36.068
>> THIS IS MY VOICE.

10:36.068 --> 10:36.586
>> CAN YOU SING.

10:36.586 --> 10:37.137
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.344
>> CAN I CALL HER A SMOKE SHOW.

10:39.344 --> 10:40.241
HOW OLD IS SHE.

10:40.241 --> 10:41.068
>> SHE'S 16.

10:41.068 --> 10:42.068
>> SCRATCH THAT.

10:42.068 --> 10:44.379
THAT'S NOT CALL HER A SMOKE

10:44.379 --> 10:44.724
SHOW.

10:44.724 --> 10:47.344
YOU WERE FORCED FROM DAY ONE TO

10:47.344 --> 10:48.413
WRESTLE IN THE FEMALE DIVISION,

10:48.413 --> 10:49.965
BUT IN HIGH SCHOOL, YOU WERE

10:49.965 --> 10:51.655
IDENTIFIED AS A MAN THE WHOLE

10:51.655 --> 10:52.000
TIME.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.344
>> YES.

10:52.344 --> 10:53.862
>> DID YOU EVER LOSE TO A GIRL.

10:53.862 --> 10:54.241

10:55.586 --> 10:56.448
>> WAS SHE WHITE.

10:56.448 --> 11:00.137
>> SHE WAS MEXICAN.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.137
PUERTO RICAN MAYBE.

11:01.137 --> 11:01.793
>> PUERTO RICAN TEXANS.

11:01.793 --> 11:03.586
>> CALL THEM THE SAME THING IN

11:03.586 --> 11:05.206
MY COOL, YOU'LL BE KILLED.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.344
>> GOT YOU: HARD LINE.

11:07.344 --> 11:09.137
>> DID THEY FORCE YOU TO USE THE

11:09.137 --> 11:10.586
GIRL'S LOCKER ROOK.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.000
>> THEY DIDN'T FORCE ME.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.206
>> YOU CHOSE TO.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.241
WERE YOU THE ONLY TRANSGENDER

11:16.241 --> 11:17.068
KID IN YOUR SCHOOL.

11:17.068 --> 11:18.655
>> I WAS AND THEN MORE PEOPLE

11:18.655 --> 11:19.413
STARTED COMING OUT IN HIGH

11:19.413 --> 11:19.793
SCHOOL.

11:19.793 --> 11:21.724
>> DID YOU EVER SECRETLY GET

11:21.724 --> 11:22.000
MAD.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.793
LIKE, HEY, THIS IS KIND OF MY

11:24.793 --> 11:25.103
THING.

11:25.103 --> 11:25.448
>> NO.

11:25.448 --> 11:28.379
>> YOU JUST HAD YOUR BREAST

11:28.379 --> 11:28.758
REMOVED.

11:28.758 --> 11:29.793
>> YES >> DID YOU HAVE BIG BOBS

11:29.793 --> 11:30.724
TO BEGIN WITH.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.344
>> NO, WHEN I HAD A SLING LET ON

11:33.344 --> 11:34.413
IT'S LIKE HOW I AM NOW.

11:34.413 --> 11:36.793
>> YOU LOOK LIKE PHIL MICKELSON.

11:36.793 --> 11:37.862
HE'S A GOLFER.

11:37.862 --> 11:39.586
YOU CAN ONLY SEE IN THE SHIRT.

11:39.586 --> 11:41.000
THAT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.827
I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN IT

11:42.827 --> 11:43.137
FIXED.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.827
CAN WE DO A BEFORE AND AFTER AND

11:46.827 --> 11:47.551
TELL US IF PHIL MICKELSON HAD

11:47.551 --> 11:48.620
THE CHEST WORKED ON.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.206
BACK TO YOU.

11:49.206 --> 11:51.482
DID YOU GIVE THEM ONE LAST

11:51.482 --> 11:53.517
SQUEEZE BEFORE YOU GOT RID OF

11:53.517 --> 11:53.862
THEM.

11:53.862 --> 11:55.379
>> NO.

11:55.379 --> 11:59.137
>> HAVE YOU HAD A TWISTER YET.

11:59.137 --> 11:59.482
>> NO.

11:59.482 --> 12:00.655
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN FIND

12:00.655 --> 12:01.931
IT TO BE HONEST.

12:01.931 --> 12:03.275
>> I KNOW WHERE IT IS UNLESS

12:03.275 --> 12:05.827
YOUR DOCTOR IS COMPLETELY

12:05.827 --> 12:09.172
INSANE.

12:09.172 --> 12:11.448
>> YOU'RE AN ASS MAN.

12:11.448 --> 12:12.103
THAT'S MATURE OF YOU.

12:12.103 --> 12:13.551
GOING TO DO THE BOTTOM OR NO.

12:13.551 --> 12:15.137

12:15.137 --> 12:20.793
DEFINITELY GOING TO DO THE

12:20.793 --> 12:21.137
BOTTOM.

12:21.137 --> 12:22.172
>> THERE'S ONE WHERE THE CLIT

12:22.172 --> 12:23.000
GETS BIGGER.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.862
IF YOU HAVE A BIG ONE, IT WILL

12:24.862 --> 12:25.241
BE BIGGER.

12:25.241 --> 12:26.344
>> HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.172
>> 25-30 GRAND.

12:28.172 --> 12:30.827
>> FOR A TINY DICK.

12:30.827 --> 12:31.965
>> I'M GUESSING.

12:31.965 --> 12:33.310
>> THAT'S A GAMBLE RIGHT THERE.

12:33.310 --> 12:34.310
>> THE OTHER SURGERY IS TAKE

12:34.310 --> 12:35.827
PART OF THE SKIN ON MY THIGH OR

12:35.827 --> 12:38.103
SOMEWHERE ON MY BODY AND THEN

12:38.103 --> 12:38.965
THEY SHAPE IT.

12:38.965 --> 12:40.551
AND THEN THEY ATTACH IT.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.655
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE SAVED YOU

12:43.655 --> 12:44.000
BOOBS.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.793
>> IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT

12:45.793 --> 12:46.172
ACTUALLY.

12:46.172 --> 12:47.689
>> WHAT DO THEY DO WITH -- DO

12:47.689 --> 12:49.206
THEY CREATE BALLS.

12:49.206 --> 12:50.620
>> THAT'S A QUESTION I NEED TO

12:50.620 --> 12:50.965
LOOK.

12:50.965 --> 12:52.482
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY GUY FRIENDS

12:52.482 --> 12:53.689
THAT LET YOU REALLY TAKE A GOOD

12:53.689 --> 12:55.896
LOOK AND FIGURE STUFF OUT?

12:55.896 --> 12:58.000
BALLS ARE CONFUSING.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
>> I'VE LOOKED.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.689
>> I KNOW, BUT THERE'S THE SACK

13:01.689 --> 13:03.206
AND YOU CAN'T SWITCH THEM TO THE

13:03.206 --> 13:03.655
OTHER SACK.

13:03.655 --> 13:05.000
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WORK ONE OF

13:05.000 --> 13:06.620
THE BALLS OVER AND YOU DO IT.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.275
YOU TRY.

13:07.275 --> 13:08.862
AS A KID OVER AND OVER YOU TRY

13:08.862 --> 13:10.793
TO SEE IF YOU CAN SHOVE IT IN

13:10.793 --> 13:12.000
THE OTHER SACK.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.241
IT DOESN'T GO.

13:13.241 --> 13:15.448
>> I'M PRETTY SURE ONE OF MY

13:15.448 --> 13:17.275
FRIENDS WOULD BE UP TO IT.

13:17.275 --> 13:18.448
HE'S JUST WEIRD.

13:18.448 --> 13:19.482
THEY'RE ACTUALLY MY SISTER'S

13:19.482 --> 13:20.241
FRIENDS BEFORE.

13:20.241 --> 13:23.655
>> IS YOUR SISTER OLDER OR

13:23.655 --> 13:24.000
YOUNGER.

13:24.000 --> 13:24.724
>> YEAR YOUNGER THAN ME.

13:24.724 --> 13:25.793
>> WERE YOU PRETTIER.

13:25.793 --> 13:26.310
>> NO.

13:26.310 --> 13:27.862
SHE DEFINITELY GOT THE LOOKS.

13:27.862 --> 13:29.827
>> SHE GOT THE LOOKS AND YOU'RE

13:29.827 --> 13:32.827
GOING GET THE PENIS.

13:32.827 --> 13:35.310
YOU SHOWED HER.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.000
WHAT'S YOUR TATTOO MEAN?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.275
>> HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.793
>> ARE YOU FINISHED GETTING

13:40.793 --> 13:41.137
TATTOOS.

13:41.137 --> 13:41.482
>> NO.

13:41.482 --> 13:43.482
>> ARE YOU COVERING YOUR WHOLE

13:43.482 --> 13:43.827
BODY?

13:43.827 --> 13:45.068
>> ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO WEIGH

13:45.068 --> 13:45.862
IN OR?

13:45.862 --> 13:49.000

13:49.000 --> 13:51.172
YEAH, I'M READY.

13:51.172 --> 13:51.620
THINK THIN.

13:51.620 --> 14:03.103
>> MACK IS WEIGHING IN AT 125.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.620
DANIEL IS 183.

14:05.620 --> 14:09.310
>> WHOA.

14:09.310 --> 14:09.896
DUDE.

14:09.896 --> 14:10.551
125.

14:10.551 --> 14:11.965
FOR A SECOND, I THOUGHT I WAS

14:11.965 --> 14:22.034
GOING TO HAVE TO WHOP OFF HALF

14:22.034 --> 14:24.689
MY DONG TO DROP POUNDS.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.206
NACHOS, COTTON CANDY.

14:27.206 --> 14:29.103
ILLEGAL BET.

14:29.103 --> 14:36.379
>> MACK, YOU'RE ABOUT TO GUEST

14:36.379 --> 14:40.758
TEST TOSSER -- OWNED.

14:40.758 --> 14:45.379
SHAKE HANDS.

14:45.379 --> 15:34.551
HELLO.

15:34.551 --> 15:36.655
>> NOW, THE BEST PART OF BEING A

15:36.655 --> 15:40.655
MAN IS SHOWERING TOGETHER.

15:40.655 --> 15:42.344
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

15:42.344 --> 15:46.482
TECHNICALLY A HATE CRIME.

15:46.482 --> 15:48.275
>> MACK PROVES A LOT MORE THAN

15:48.275 --> 15:49.551
MY EGO.

15:49.551 --> 15:50.896
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, BUT FIRST

15:50.896 --> 15:53.172
THE POPSICLE DOESN'T FALL FAR

15:53.172 --> 15:58.517
FROM THE TREE.

15:58.517 --> 16:00.413
>> SUCH A SPECIAL TALENT.

16:00.413 --> 16:01.517
YOU CAN FIX IT ALL THE WAY TO

16:01.517 --> 16:16.758
YOU CAN FIX IT ALL THE WAY TO
THE BACK OF YOUR NECK.

16:16.758 --> 16:41.482
THE BACK OF YOUR NECK.

16:41.482 --> 16:41.827
ABUSE.

16:41.827 --> 16:43.965
YOU THROW A SHEET OVER THEM, SAY

16:43.965 --> 16:46.000
A BOGUS SPELL, LIFT THE SHEET

16:46.000 --> 16:48.344
OFF AND EVERYONE GASPS AND ACTS

16:48.344 --> 16:52.034
LIKE THEY'RE INVISIBLE.

16:52.034 --> 16:54.241
TO SEAL THE DEAL, YOU TAKE A

16:54.241 --> 16:56.620
PICTURE BEFOREHAND WITH AN EMPTY

16:56.620 --> 16:59.000
CHAIR AND WATCH IT SHATTER THEIR

16:59.000 --> 17:10.413
FRAGILE LITTLE MIND.

17:10.413 --> 17:12.689
I LEARNED ABOUT THIS PRANK THE

17:12.689 --> 17:16.310
HARD WAY WHEN I WAS THE BUTT OF

17:16.310 --> 17:16.655
JOKE.

17:16.655 --> 17:20.517
>> ONE, TWO, THREE.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.413
AM I INVISIBLE?

17:22.413 --> 17:22.724
OH.

17:22.724 --> 17:25.068
THIS IS WHAT IT MUST FEEL LIKE

17:25.068 --> 17:29.103
TO WORK AT CVS.

17:29.103 --> 17:29.413
OH.

17:29.413 --> 17:32.655
YOU'RE NOT INVISIBLE.

17:32.655 --> 17:33.965
IT'S A PRANK.

17:33.965 --> 17:34.862
HR.

17:34.862 --> 17:35.586
HR.

17:35.586 --> 17:40.241
I'M GOING TO NEED THAT SHEET.

17:40.241 --> 17:42.965
>> THEY NEVER REVERSE THE

17:42.965 --> 17:43.413
INVISIBILITY.

17:43.413 --> 17:44.137
YOU'RE NOT GOING BELIEVE WHAT

17:44.137 --> 17:45.689
I'M DOING NOW.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.931
STILL JERKING IT.

17:46.931 --> 17:47.482
ALL RIGHT.

BOYCOTT BULLYING AND FINALLY,

19:03.310 --> 19:06.517
TIME TO PLAY MY WIFE'S FAVORITE

19:06.517 --> 19:06.862

19:15.310 --> 19:16.206
MARGOT ROBBIE.

19:16.206 --> 19:16.965
VERY TALENTED AND BEAUTIFUL.

19:16.965 --> 19:19.793
MY MOM'S NAME IS MARGOT AND I

19:19.793 --> 19:22.000
WOULD NOT CHEAT ON MY WIFE WITH

19:22.000 --> 19:22.689
MY MOM.

19:22.689 --> 19:25.758
TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS ALL

19:25.758 --> 19:26.206
HYPOTHETICAL.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.000
I'M AWARE THESE WOMEN WOULD NOT

19:27.000 --> 19:31.275
WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

19:31.275 --> 19:32.310
I MEAN, MOST LIKELY.

19:32.310 --> 19:35.068
I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE THAN MOST

19:35.068 --> 19:36.724
OF YOU.

19:36.724 --> 19:37.551
RIHANNA.

19:37.551 --> 19:37.862
YES.

19:37.862 --> 19:40.413
YES, I WOULD, BUT ONLY ONCE.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.000
AND THEN I WOULD TELL MY WIFE IT

19:42.000 --> 19:46.620
WAS RIHANNA.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.551
SHE'D SAY IT'S RIHANNA.

19:48.551 --> 19:51.068
I WOULD BE LIKE, SPELLED THE

19:51.068 --> 19:51.413
SAME.

19:51.413 --> 19:51.862
JASON MOMOA.

19:51.862 --> 19:55.724
THAT'S A HARD NO.

19:55.724 --> 19:56.034
OKAY.

19:56.034 --> 19:58.275
NOT IN THE D.C. UNIVERSE MARVEL

19:58.275 --> 20:00.448
FOR LIFE.

20:00.448 --> 20:02.931
EMILY RATAJKOWSKI.

20:02.931 --> 20:03.206
YES.

20:03.206 --> 20:04.931
IF SHE AND I EVER GOT TOGETHER,

20:04.931 --> 20:06.344
I WOULD RECOMMEND MAKING ME THE

20:06.344 --> 20:10.034
LEAD SUSPECT IN MY WIFE'S

20:10.034 --> 20:10.793
DISAPPEARANCE.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.172
MICHAEL B. JORDAN.

20:12.172 --> 20:14.034
I DO THINK HE IS ONE OF THE BEST

20:14.034 --> 20:15.758
LOOKING HUMANS ALIVE.

20:15.758 --> 20:19.689
AND WE WOULD HAVE BEAUTIFUL

20:19.689 --> 20:20.034
BABIES.

20:20.034 --> 20:21.586
I PROBABLY WANT TO KEEP HIM IN

20:21.586 --> 20:23.586
THE FRIEND ZONE, BUT CHEATING

20:23.586 --> 20:25.551
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST

20:25.551 --> 20:26.000
INTERCOURSE.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.379
IT CAN BE TEXTING, KISSING,

20:28.379 --> 20:28.758
BONDAGE.

20:28.758 --> 20:31.793
IT ALL COUNTS.

20:31.793 --> 20:32.793
AUBREY PLAZA.

20:32.793 --> 20:35.793
SEEMS LIKE A LATERAL MOVE, BUT

20:35.793 --> 20:38.724
SURE.

20:38.724 --> 20:39.655
