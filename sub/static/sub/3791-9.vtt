01:17.453 --> 01:18.828
So they're just gonna
give him 100 grand?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.663
Cash, in a bag,
that's correct.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.165
Just to show up
to a party?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.333
Just to show up.
You don't even have to smile, Vin.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.919
- Only in America.
- No, only in Vegas.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.921
So what do you say, E?
Should we go?

01:29.006 --> 01:30.840
Well, seeing that you told
the Hollywood Foreign Press

01:30.924 --> 01:32.133
that the whole town
is a bunch of dickheads,

01:32.217 --> 01:34.135
I don't think anybody's
gonna miss us.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.888
- What you're saying is, we should go.
- Have I ever said no to Vegas?

01:36.972 --> 01:38.598
Be like saying no
to a blowjob.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.224
What do you say,
Johnny? Vegas?

01:40.309 --> 01:43.394
Uh, love to, bro, but I'm
shooting my pilot on the 30th.

01:43.479 --> 01:46.272
- I gotta stay rested.
- You're turning down Vegas, Drama?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.107
I'm gonna be turning down
a lot of things, Turtle,

01:48.192 --> 01:50.693
now that I'm a working actor.
Better get used to it.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.987
You know, Johnny, there are many
different Vegases.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.364
You could go
and just spot.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.200
Don't you have that masseuse
you love over there?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.410
Oh, yeah,
Ken at the Hard Rock.

01:59.495 --> 02:01.162
He's got hands of gold.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.414
It's insane that you
let a man rub your body.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.292
No, what's insane is that you think
a massage is sexual.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.211
A real massage requires
strong, manly hands,

02:09.295 --> 02:11.380
which my boy Ken
has got in spades.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.800
After 24 hours with Ken,

02:13.884 --> 02:16.093
I'm ready for work.
Absolutely, bro, I'm in.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.095
Nice. Let's do it.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.306
- Who's gonna break the news to Ari?
- Oh...

02:20.390 --> 02:22.016
be happy to.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.768
Vin, this is not
the time to go to Vegas.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.937
You've got a serious
public image problem right now.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.188
That's why I'm going, Ari.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.774
Hoping by the time I get back,
everyone will have forgotten about it.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.235
Come on, Vinnie, listen,
we need to get you a job.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.153
- You read any of those scripts?
- I brought 'em with.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.780
Thought you might
read 'em to me.

02:35.864 --> 02:39.242
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we could use a chaperone.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.787
- Help keep us out of trouble.
- I'm not going to Vegas on a Wednesday.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.622
- Come on, what else you got to do?
- I have the theater

02:44.706 --> 02:47.500
with the wife
and her mother tonight.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.293
Move over, I'm in.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.088
Nice relaxing Wednesday
may be just what I need.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.423
Vegas, baby, Vegas!

03:23.078 --> 03:25.162
I'm sorry, baby,
you know I'd rather be

03:25.247 --> 03:27.874
at "Menopause, the Musical"
tonight than here, but I got kidnapped!

03:27.958 --> 03:29.500
- It's true!
- You see that, baby?

03:29.585 --> 03:32.211
- Will you sign this?
- I'm sorry, honey...

03:32.296 --> 03:34.463
- Hello? Hello?
- Is she mad?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.382
She said she'd rather
see me gagged and bound

03:36.466 --> 03:38.217
like a real kidnappee,
yeah, so I think so.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.845
Oh, all right, here comes
the apology.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.221
Hey, baby.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.390
I put $6 million
into this company

03:44.474 --> 03:47.351
and find out at the staff meeting
that you're at the roulette table?

03:47.436 --> 03:49.645
- Oh, hey, Babs, how are ya?
- What the fuck are you doing, Ari?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.690
I'm taking care of a high-priority
client, that's what I'm doing.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.151
- You have 150 clients to keep happy.
- ARl: Barbara...

03:55.235 --> 03:57.028
You need to manage
your time more efficiently.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.488
- You're not my mother, Babs.
- Fuck you, Ari.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.449
See, my mother would
never speak to me that way.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.117
I hate women!

04:03.785 --> 04:05.453
Not all women.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.954
Who's got five?

04:07.039 --> 04:09.040
Ready and waiting, bro.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.249
- What's this?
- Tradition.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.543
When we were kids, we'd hit AC,
we'd put five bucks on red.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.920
We win, we knew it'd
be a good weekend.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.213
ARl: What if you lose?
Vince never loses.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.839
Five on red.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.841
Come on!

04:21.011 --> 04:23.012
Red 16.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.222
- It's gonna be a good weekend.
- Keep the change, bro.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.682
Hey, Vinnie, what do you say
we go halves?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.517
We'll do like
a gambling partnership.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.102
- Okay, Ari, you're on.
- All right.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.813
- Hey! Vinnie Chase.
- Seth.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.106
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

04:34.191 --> 04:35.816
You here for that thing
at Body English tonight?

04:35.901 --> 04:38.069
- Yeah.
- Cool, yeah, me too. It should be fun.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.445
- I brought my whole crew out.
- Definitely.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.490
- You know Ari Gold, my agent?
- Never met, big fan.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.116
That's funny dude.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.993
That pinky bought me
a house in Malibu.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.828
Malibu!

04:49.039 --> 04:50.039
And I think you know E.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.540
How you doing, Seth?
Good to see you again.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.627
How you doing, man? How'd that thing
work out for you at the hotel?

04:54.711 --> 04:55.795
Like I said,
it wasn't what it looked like.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.755
Like I said, it never is.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.090
So, how's Sloan, man?

04:59.174 --> 05:00.925
She's still good, Seth.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.344
Cool, hey, do me a favor.
Tell her I said "What up," okay?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.845
Yeah, I will.
I'll tell her that.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.889
- All right. See ya.
See ya.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.767
- What's up, Seth?
- Oh, Johnny Drama.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.394
- How you doing, man?
- Did you hear about my pilot?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.020
- No! Congratulations!
- Thanks, bro.

05:13.105 --> 05:16.774
Good for you, man!
You could use the work.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.776
What the fuck is up
with this guy?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.319
Every time I see him,
he asks me about Sloan

05:20.404 --> 05:22.238
and he's got a shit-eating
grin on his face.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.156
- Don't get all panicky, E.
- Seriously, E,

05:24.241 --> 05:25.825
you'd be jealous
if he said they were cousins.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.494
- What does that mean?
- It means you're a jealous guy.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.246
Always have been.
- Bullshit.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.331
Face it E, you're like
Eric Roberts in "Star 80."

05:32.416 --> 05:33.958
How would you know?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.085
- I've heard stories.
- Yeah? Name one example.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.045
Andy Abetemarco,
10th grade.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.047
You punched him in the head
just because he got assigned

05:40.132 --> 05:41.716
to be Audrey Polini's
lab partner.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.010
There's more to that story,
Turtle, he stole her frog.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.928
- Hey, you know they got married?
- Really?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.680
No, but see,
you're still jealous.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.640
- Whatever.
- Whatever, exactly.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.226
- I don't think Seth meant anything.
- All right.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.478
Nice room, Turtle.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.522
Hey, boys,
fruit's all green.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.232
Whoa, easy with that, Ari.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.692
It's from Body English.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.361
Ah! 100k, Vince.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.114
Nice.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.450
Hey Vinnie, who'd you
have to fuck to get that?

06:07.534 --> 06:10.119
No fucking, Ari.
I just have to go to a party.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.620
Not according
to this itinerary.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.081
Says you also gotta be at a pool event
this afternoon and then drinks

06:14.166 --> 06:16.250
- with the contestants tonight.
- Contestants?

06:16.334 --> 06:17.835
Yeah, says you're judging
a beauty contest.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.337
- Queen of the Strip.
- Sounds like a bonus.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.465
Sounds like I don't know
what you got us into as usual.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.467
So far it all looks
pretty good, doesn't it?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.385
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I'm gonna go check it out.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.388
I'm comin' with you.
Hey, Vinnie, go win us some money.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.099
God damn, I feel at ease.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.726
I'm out.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.311
You brought your own robe?

06:35.645 --> 06:37.438
Why wouldn't I?

07:08.303 --> 07:10.805
- Mind if we join you?
Sure.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.682
- I'll take some chips, please.
- All of it?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.935
- Well, 10 is yours, do what you want.
- Really?

07:16.019 --> 07:17.853
Yeah, man. Commission.
You earned it.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.064
Thank you, Vince!

07:31.910 --> 07:34.829
Uh-oh.
- You... you booked him into this?

07:34.913 --> 07:36.789
- Turtle did.
- Nice job managing.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.083
This should be great
for his image.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.626
What are you doing?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.586
I'm on vay-cay.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.130
Getting a cocktail.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.049
All right. What are we drinking?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.056
Yes, we have you
down for it...

07:54.182 --> 07:56.767
- Johnny!
- Hey, Ken!

07:57.185 --> 07:59.603
- It's been a while.
- How are ya, buddy?

08:01.106 --> 08:03.566
Good to see ya.
You look great. You look great.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.151
I lost a couple pounds.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.486
- Yeah, it shows.
- Thanks.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.488
What have you got there?

08:09.573 --> 08:12.366
California almonds.
I remember last time I was in town

08:12.450 --> 08:15.202
you said you couldn't
find a decent almond in the desert,

08:15.287 --> 08:17.329
so I thought, well...

08:17.414 --> 08:19.039
Wow. I can't believe
you remembered.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.624
That's really thoughtful.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.627
I got an elephant's brain, Ken.
I remember everything.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.255
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it,

08:26.339 --> 08:28.841
I'm stressed
like a motherfucker.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.553
A little of that, a little
of this, some of that...

08:35.432 --> 08:37.725
All right, come on, baby!
Come on!

08:37.808 --> 08:39.727
Yes!

08:39.811 --> 08:41.770
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

08:48.236 --> 08:50.237
He should just cancel this.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.989
Definitely.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.492
- He's up 2500.
- Oh yeah?

08:55.619 --> 08:58.287
That means I'm up 1250.
Drinks are on me, E.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.581
- One more for the road?
- Definitely.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.545
Oh Ken, you have
not lost your touch.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.090
All these compliments
are gonna make me insecure.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.593
Well don't be.
You've got the gift.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.637
- No doubt.
- Thanks.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.806
In fact, I'd like to lock you
down for the rest of the day.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.183
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.602
I'll double your rate.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.480
'Cause I don't want
these hands touching anyone but me.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.148
Ooh...

09:27.275 --> 09:28.484
Hit me.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.946
Sorry, sir.
- Hey, you can't stay hot forever.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.824
- Hit.
- Ah, but Turtle can!

09:36.076 --> 09:37.743
Hey, jerkoff,
you signed him up

09:37.827 --> 09:40.079
- to judge a stripper contest.
- Really?

09:40.163 --> 09:41.747
- Titties?
- It's a stripper contest.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.582
- Nice.
- Vin, you should cancel.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.084
- I agree.
- Can't cancel.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.418
Yeah, you can.
You didn't sign anything.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.003
- Just give the money back.
- Money's gone, E.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.422
- What are you talking about?
- I hit a little cold streak.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.590
You lost 100 grand?

09:51.675 --> 09:54.426
- Something like that.
- But we're partners.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.637
Oh, shit, I forgot.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.514
Means I'm only really down 50.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.350
Shoulda partnered up with me, Ari.
I'm up 1200.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.601
I get to two grand,

10:02.686 --> 10:05.145
I'm keeping it stashed
to buy me a high class ho.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.689
But Turtle,
I already gave you 10.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.357
I only pay for pussy
with profits.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.984
I thought you
never lose, Vin.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.652
It's not a loss
till we leave Nevada.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.821
- I'll win it back. Don't you worry.
- I'm worried, Vin.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.407
- I'm worried!
- If you want out, cut your losses...

10:16.491 --> 10:18.951
What, and miss the boat when you go
on a million dollar run?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.202
- No way, count me in.
- All right.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.954
Vince, you gotta
blow off this stripper thing, man.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.956
- No, let's go, it'll be fun.
It will be.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.292
And we gotta be at the pool
for the meet-and-greet in five minutes.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.876
- That'll definitely be fun.
- Let's do it.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.629
Fuck the pool,
let's win our money back.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.631
You don't care about him judging
a stripper contest, Ari?

10:32.716 --> 10:34.216
Which is worse
for his image?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.634
That he judges
a stripper contest,

10:35.719 --> 10:37.761
or he loses a couple hundred thousand
at the fucking tables?

10:37.846 --> 10:39.596
Table's not going
anywhere, calm down.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.557
Hey, yo, E!

10:42.475 --> 10:44.184
Hey, did you tell Sloan
I said "What up"?

10:44.269 --> 10:46.228
- No, Seth.
- Why not?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.856
Because it was like
a half an hour ago.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.524
It's just a phone call, man.
Make the call.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.067
- Say "What up. "
- Yeah, E.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.986
Make the call,
say "What up. "

10:57.407 --> 10:59.867
So this dickhead is saying what,
that he fucked my girlfriend?

10:59.951 --> 11:01.327
I don't know, E.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.745
It's hard to say
what he was saying.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.372
It's not hard to say. Seth Green
landed on Plymouth Rock

11:05.457 --> 11:07.291
- before you did, E. Wake up.
- No shot.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.044
I'm so not interested in this! Can we
please go out there and win some money?

11:10.128 --> 11:11.628
- Please, Vinnie!
- The strippers aren't even here yet.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.464
Look, E, it could've
been years ago.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.342
The guy's been running around Hollywood
since he was like 12.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.385
And Sloan does
like her men petite.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.179
Fuck that. I know
every guy she's been with.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.638
How?
What, did you make a list?

11:21.723 --> 11:25.309
Yeah, Turtle. Couples make lists. You
wouldn't know that for obvious reasons.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.644
Where the fuck are these girls!
Somebody...

11:27.729 --> 11:29.229
What Ari, you and your wife
didn't make lists?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.774
- We did. I'm the only one on it.
- Yeah, right.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.400
Look E, I don't
wanna rile you up,

11:33.485 --> 11:35.027
but I've done
the list thing.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.695
What, did you hand
over a hard drive, Vin?

11:36.780 --> 11:40.199
It was big. But I did leave
some off. Everyone does.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.241
So what,
you're saying that...

11:41.326 --> 11:43.035
that Sloan left
Seth Green off the list?

11:43.119 --> 11:46.080
I think everybody leaves
someone off the list.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.831
Except you.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.459
I'm calling.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.711
Ain't you gonna
call your wife, Ari?

11:52.796 --> 11:55.589
I don't care if my wife's getting fucked
right now, Turtle,

11:55.673 --> 11:58.050
I need to get
my money back!

11:59.010 --> 12:00.344
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.845
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.807
I'm Joanne, but I go
by the stage name of Cheyenne.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.642
I understand you're
judging the contest.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.143
- Yes...
- Is there anything I can do

12:08.228 --> 12:10.479
- to get you to vote for me?
- Yeah, Vince,

12:10.563 --> 12:12.481
what's a girl gotta do
to get a vote around here?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.441
Come on, Vince, we're gonna get
stuck here all day. Let's go.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.902
Girls, due to circumstances
beyond my control...

12:16.986 --> 12:19.154
- Me!
- I have to go.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.823
But talk to my boy, Turtle, here.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.951
He's the eyes, mouth
and ears of this operation.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.078
- Enjoy.
- First, the commission, now this?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.287
This is like Christmas.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.248
- Hi, Turtle.
- How you doin'?

12:29.332 --> 12:31.125
So you're really
his eyes and ears?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.710
Ken, whatever happened
to that pretty little

12:33.795 --> 12:35.796
Filipino girlfriend
of yours, Annie?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.465
Sore subject.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.217
She just moved out
a week ago.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.677
Fuck her.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.804
Hands like yours...
her loss.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.307
- Still hurts.
- Yeah, I hear you, Ken.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.268
You know what?

12:49.352 --> 12:52.187
Johnny Drama's got just the cure
for your heartbreak.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.897
Really? What's that?

12:53.982 --> 12:56.483
Boys' night out.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.528
Just a good steak,
nice bottle of red,

12:59.696 --> 13:02.239
couple cigars
and some good conversation.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.199
You do that, Ken,
and you'll forget

13:04.284 --> 13:06.118
all about women
in no time.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.412
I don't usually go out
socially with clients, Johnny.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.790
Ken, I'd like to think
after all this time

13:11.875 --> 13:13.917
you look at me as more
than just a client.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.214
Oh, Eric.
He's so annoying.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.466
Annoying how?

13:20.550 --> 13:21.800
We were on a teen
tour together,

13:21.885 --> 13:24.428
and he was obsessed with me
for like the entire trip.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.682
- But you never dated him?
- No, Eric, I never dated him.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.976
This is a tough
competition, girls,

13:31.060 --> 13:33.145
and what,
with a $25,000 prize,

13:33.229 --> 13:35.230
everybody needs an edge.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.857
Fortunately for you,

13:36.941 --> 13:38.901
I left my integrity
back in Los Angeles.

13:38.985 --> 13:42.154
My vote is 100% for sale.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.702
Hit me.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.831
Jesus!

13:53.416 --> 13:55.125
ARl: What the fuck are you
smirking about?

13:55.210 --> 13:56.793
Huh?
Where are you going?

13:56.878 --> 13:58.629
Oh, I'm not feeling it right now.
You can't force the cards.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.465
- How much are we down?
- Uh, 110. Each.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.509
Jesus!

14:03.593 --> 14:06.470
- We'll get it back after dinner.
- I'm not hungry, Vinnie.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.473
You take the reins,
maybe you'll have better luck.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.893
Don't go too crazy, I don't wanna lose
more than 500 grand.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.689
Bring it.
Bring it!

14:17.774 --> 14:19.691
So you talked to her,

14:19.776 --> 14:22.027
- and she said nothing happened?
- Right.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.445
Why's he trying to make
it like something did?

14:23.530 --> 14:24.863
'Cause he's a jerkoff.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.032
- Why are you so calm?
- The old E

14:27.116 --> 14:28.867
would not have been able
to control himself.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.744
The old E,
"Mad Dog" E,

14:30.828 --> 14:32.371
woulda bit
Seth Green's ear off.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.748
Guys, I'm a grown man.
I don't fight anymore.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.208
Oh, way to be mature.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.627
Yeah, you're really entering
your latter years gracefully.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.671
Speaking of latter years...

14:40.922 --> 14:42.798
Fuck off, E.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.508
How relaxed do I look?

14:44.842 --> 14:47.719
Mmm, you look like
you died in 1983.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.805
Wait till you see me
after a shower,

14:49.889 --> 14:52.057
I'm gonna sparkle
like the 4th of July.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.561
Wait till you see dinner.
I got 10 of the best strippers in town

14:55.645 --> 14:57.437
- joining us tonight.
Oooh!

14:57.522 --> 14:58.981
Strippers? Why?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.566
Now, shouldn't it be,
strippers, how

15:00.650 --> 15:01.984
- and thank you?
- Thank you.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.403
Look, we don't want girls
at the table tonight.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.780
I'm just trying to keep this
trip free of distractions.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.366
We? Who's we?

15:09.617 --> 15:11.118
Ken. He's gonna be
joining us tonight.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.953
You don't want
strippers at dinner

15:13.037 --> 15:15.038
'cause your gay masseuse
is joining us?

15:15.123 --> 15:17.082
I'm really starting
to worry about you, Drama.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.293
Oh please, Turtle,
Ken is not gay.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.546
In fact, if I release him
on the strippers tonight,

15:22.630 --> 15:24.214
you're gonna be
shit out of luck.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.301
Oh, please. Bring it on.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.637
So, have you seen
"Brokeback Mountain," Kenneth?

15:30.722 --> 15:33.181
Nah. I don't get
to the movies.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.100
When I'm not working,
I'm usually training.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.603
- Training for what?
- Well, it's probably too late for me,

15:37.687 --> 15:39.438
but I still dream
of the NFL.

15:39.522 --> 15:43.358
- You play ball?
- Ken was a superstar at U of A.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.611
I don't know
about superstar.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.322
Oh, yes.
Yes you were.

15:48.406 --> 15:51.116
And a second-round draft pick
for the San Diego Chargers.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.493
Went 74 yards
and three receptions

15:53.578 --> 15:56.622
in his first NFL quarter,
then blew out his knee.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.373
Fucking Astroturf.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.958
That sucks, man.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.336
You really do remember
everything, Johnny.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.173
- Elephant brain.
- Turtle, girls.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.302
Watch this.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.887
- Hey, Shelby.
- Hi, Turtle.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.138
- Crystal.
- Hi, Turtle.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.806
- Tiffany.
- Hi, sweetie.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.350
- This is Bunny.
- Hey, Turtle.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.393
And Minx.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.063
Yo, E, be cool.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.276
I'm cool, Vince.
I'm totally cool.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.986
What do ya got, what do ya got?
Come on, come on.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.488
Show me a little love,
little love, little love.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.782
What do ya think...
fuck!

16:31.866 --> 16:34.117
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.246
Can I have another marker?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.207
Please?
Please...

16:52.011 --> 16:53.845
This is Mt. Kilimanjaro,

16:53.930 --> 16:56.682
one of the tallest mountains
on earth and it's freezing.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.018
So I say to this girl,

17:00.103 --> 17:03.063
"I'd be happy to give up
my canteen for you,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.398
but what are you
gonna give up for me?"

17:05.483 --> 17:07.818
Fantastic.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.569
Oh, Ken.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.531
I gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.119
So?

17:18.246 --> 17:20.122
- I love him.
- I told you.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.749
Let's hit the bar.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.710
Maybe I should check on Ari,
see how he's doing.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.336
He can't be doing
any worse than you.

17:26.421 --> 17:29.423
Oh, it's Vinnie Chase
and the chasers!

17:29.632 --> 17:31.216
Hey, let me get
a couple more Jager shots

17:31.300 --> 17:33.552
- for the boys from Queens over there.
- No thanks.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.303
What's the matter,
you don't drink, Eric?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.805
I drink vodka, Seth. I stopped drinking
Jager in high school.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.433
Oh!

17:39.517 --> 17:41.309
But listen, I told Sloan
you said "What up. "

17:41.394 --> 17:43.729
Mmm.
What'd she say?

17:43.813 --> 17:44.896
She said "What up. "

17:44.981 --> 17:47.816
- That's all?
- That's all.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.901
All right.
All right.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.070
You tell her I said
"What up" back.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.365
Yeah, man. Don't forget to tell her
he said "What up" back.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.453
What is wrong with these guys?
They're like retards.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.912
Yeah, but you were calm.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.915
Yeah, but is it gonna last though, E?
Or are we doing battle?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.418
We're not doin' battle, Drama.
It ain't gonna happen.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.961
All right.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.380
All this testosterone
has put a kink in my neck.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.174
I'm gonna have to get
Ken to work that out.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.677
Better hurry up, Drama, looks like
he's working one out right now.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.512
Christ almighty.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.723
Oh, that's Amber.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.475
Country girl,
promised me three days

18:21.559 --> 18:23.935
in her father's cabin
in Montana if she wins.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.645
Turtle, I know it's
a stripper contest,

18:25.730 --> 18:27.731
but I can't pick someone
'cause she promised to fuck you.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.358
I don't care who wins.
I cut deals with all of 'em.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.364
Uh, sweetheart,
this guy's with me tonight.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.242
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to relax
before the competition.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.787
Sorry, sister,
I got my own problems.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.290
Fuck you!

18:46.417 --> 18:49.669
- I'm feeling good, Ari. Let me sit.
- Ari, relax.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.755
- How much we down?
- 200 and fuckin' 70!

18:51.839 --> 18:52.881
We can get that back.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.382
You're gonna get thrown
outta here, calm down.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.051
He's a little upset.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.471
I'll take another marker
for 100,000 please. Thanks, Sam.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.641
So, Ken, did you get to sample those
almonds I gave you?

19:02.725 --> 19:04.392
Oh, they were terrific, John.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.144
Brought me right back
to my childhood.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.646
Yeah, I knew
you'd appreciate 'em.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.606
Oh, crap.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.441
They must have
closed shop early tonight.

19:11.526 --> 19:12.818
Oh, no, no, no...

19:12.902 --> 19:14.569
How 'bout we just
reconvene in the morning?

19:14.737 --> 19:17.405
No, no. There's no way I can sleep
without a rubdown.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.282
Let's take it back
to my room, huh?

19:19.367 --> 19:22.077
Uh...
yeah... okay.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.671
- Split 'em.
- How much is that?

19:32.755 --> 19:35.757
- 75 grand.
- Now 150.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.470
Gotta do it. Split 'em again.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.390
I once saw a guy
split six times straight.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.862
- No choice. Double down.
- Vinnie, that's 300 grand.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.321
We're gonna win it all
back on this hand.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.156
Yeah, or my kids are going
to community college.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.075
I'll take this hand
myself if you want.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.716
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.301
I'd like to split
these please.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.678
- You're gonna split kings?!
- Yeah. What's it to you?

20:21.762 --> 20:24.055
I got 150 grand on this hand,
I don't want you fucking up my cards.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.182
Sir, you have
to let him play his way.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.684
- He's playing like a fucking idiot!
- Sir...

20:27.768 --> 20:29.394
Ari, calm down.
Ari, relax.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.730
You're gonna get thrown out of
the casino with 300,000 on the table.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.649
- Calm down...
- We'll take care of it later, Ari.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.447
Looks like I knew
what I was doing, huh?

20:40.531 --> 20:41.781
No, it looks like
you took her break card.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.033
Dealer has 11.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.576
Looks like she
would've had 21.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.786
I think an apology
is in order.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.291
Oh!

20:51.375 --> 20:53.543
Somebody shoot me
and put me out of my fucking misery.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.253
If only it weren't a crime.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.213
Ari, remain positive.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.424
Summon the cards you desire.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.259
Get a higher power
from above. Come on!

21:01.344 --> 21:02.594
Can't hurt to try.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.262
Please, God,
give us another 10!

21:05.932 --> 21:08.308
Yeah!

21:08.392 --> 21:11.019
Yeah! Yeah!

21:11.103 --> 21:12.604
Am I getting that apology?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.898
You know what, man?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.859
Come here.
Give it to me.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.986
You know, I don't
have my table

21:20.071 --> 21:21.446
or anything, Johnny.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.865
That's okay. We can just use
the bed, right?

21:25.493 --> 21:27.702
- I guess.
- Cool, I'll go get changed.

21:55.231 --> 21:59.025
Oh, hey, Ken, I got a nice pineapple-
coconut-aloe-vera gel.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.111
Is that cool?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.824
What the fuck are you doing, Ken?

22:05.908 --> 22:08.451
Johnny, I have never

22:08.536 --> 22:10.912
thought about a man...
in that way.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.832
But the adoration
you have poured on me today

22:13.916 --> 22:15.500
has made me
feel that if...

22:15.584 --> 22:18.420
this is something
that you need,

22:18.504 --> 22:21.423
fuck it...
it is Vegas!

22:28.556 --> 22:30.432
Johnny!

22:52.038 --> 22:53.496
Looks like they
started already.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.206
No, this is
just the pre-show.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.666
Well, now that
we're up 100 grand,

22:56.751 --> 22:59.044
we should have a post-show up in
the suite. What do you say, Turtle?

22:59.128 --> 23:00.879
I already ordered
four bottles of Cristal

23:00.963 --> 23:02.881
and 400 chocolate-covered
strawberries.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.507
- Nice.
- Does money won feel better

23:04.592 --> 23:06.551
- than money earned, or am I nuts?
- You're nuts.

23:06.635 --> 23:10.889
Oh! It's the "We don't
drink Jager" crew! What up, E?

23:10.973 --> 23:13.391
This fucking guy, man.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.769
Hey, did you tell Sloan
I said "What up" again?

23:15.853 --> 23:18.021
No, Seth, I think one
time was all she needed.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.355
What's that mean?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.357
It means she said you
used to be obsessed with her.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.985
I don't think she needs to feel like
you're still obsessed with her.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.696
- She said I was obsessed with her?
- Yeah, sorry to say.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.615
No, that's all right.
No apologies necessary.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.950
I mean, in reality,
it's more like...

23:31.077 --> 23:33.369
she was obsessed
with this.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.288
Hey, you know what?
Keep fucking dreaming, Seth.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.706
- Keep dreaming.
- Oh, you're right.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.417
I must have been dreaming about how
I blasted her in the face

23:39.502 --> 23:41.628
like a Jackson Pollock.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.838
You got a problem?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.590
- Get your fucking hand off me, man.
- No, but I do!

23:58.813 --> 24:01.564
This ought to be good
for your image, Vince.
