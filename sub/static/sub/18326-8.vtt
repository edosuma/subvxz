WEBVTT

00:56.598 --> 00:58.725
Soup's on. Come get it, y'all.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.148
Do not ride that thing in the house.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.318
But why, Dad?

01:10.403 --> 01:11.905
Because I said so.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.330
You think that's funny, Lucy?

01:23.458 --> 01:25.001
Sit. Eat.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.921
You ride that thing again in the house
and I'll turn you off.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.932
Go, go, go.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.308
[robot] Police! Halt!

01:41.309 --> 01:43.561
Public order violation of 82-I.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.772
Pronouncement: guilty.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.157
Yes! Finally hoverboards.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.827
I've been waiting for one
since Back to the Future.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.079
And that is exactly
what this episode is about.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.666
Sci-fi technologies they've been
promising us for years

02:04.833 --> 02:06.501
but have not yet materialized.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.170
[Grant] In this White Rabbit Project...

02:09.254 --> 02:10.922
[Tory] There's something
you don't see every day.

02:11.005 --> 02:14.551
we're going down the rabbit hole
of famous sci-fi promises.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.802
The future is now.

02:15.885 --> 02:19.180
To investigate which one
is closest to coming true.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.182
Under the microscope:

02:21.266 --> 02:22.350
[Tory] Where are the missiles?

02:22.433 --> 02:23.518
Jetpacks...

02:26.354 --> 02:27.605
On your left.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.940
cyborgs...

02:31.109 --> 02:32.026
[Grant] Good shot.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.278
and hoverboards.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.612
Still waiting.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.324
As usual, we'll rank our six contenders

02:38.408 --> 02:40.785
by testing them all
against three criteria.

02:42.745 --> 02:46.207
[Kari] Number one: How close is it
to fulfilling the sci-fi promise?

02:46.291 --> 02:48.334
Number two: How much does it cost?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
And three: when can I get one?

02:51.379 --> 02:52.255
Get ready, you guys

02:52.338 --> 02:55.258
'Cause first up is actually,
"Where's my hoverboard?"

03:01.431 --> 03:03.308
Let me take you back to 1989,

03:03.808 --> 03:07.437
the year that Marty McFly
hovered into pop culture with this...

03:08.813 --> 03:10.023
Hoverboard.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.030
[Grant] Now fast forward to 2015,

03:17.113 --> 03:20.158
when Back to the Future
was literally in the past,

03:20.241 --> 03:21.784
and this date specifically,

03:22.368 --> 03:24.913
October 21, 2015.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.832
The day that hoverboards
were supposed to be available.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.334
Well, that day came and went.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.210
Just gonna stretch a little.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.635
And a ton of companies jumped on board
to ride the wave of hype.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.349
This is bull-- [clanging]!

03:45.016 --> 03:46.059
Some better than others.

03:47.268 --> 03:48.770
Makes you feel ultra-cool.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.564
And the catchphrase,
"Where's my hoverboard?"

03:51.648 --> 03:53.900
became shorthand
for a future technology

03:53.983 --> 03:56.402
that had been promised
but not yet delivered.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.613
Now I will travel like this everywhere.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.409
So, what's the closest we have
to a hoverboard today?

04:04.285 --> 04:06.621
Well, there's this, the Lexus Slide.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.292
Now, at first glance,
it looks totally legit, right?

04:13.670 --> 04:14.504
But...

04:15.463 --> 04:17.882
this... is no ordinary skate park.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.801
There's a secret magnetic track

04:19.884 --> 04:23.137
hidden just beneath the surface
of the concrete and the water,

04:23.471 --> 04:28.643
and the Lexus Slide can only travel
over that one specific path.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.353
All right, so what else do we have?

04:30.436 --> 04:32.146
Well, there's the Zapata Air.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.361
Now, unlike the Lexus,
they use jet engine thrust systems,

04:39.028 --> 04:41.531
so, theoretically,
they can fly over anything

04:42.573 --> 04:45.201
which is one step closer
to the sci-fi promise.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.203
There's just one problem.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.538
They're prototypes.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.956
I can't go buy one.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.543
Turns out if I really want a hoverboard,
I've only got one option.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.920
I've got to make it myself.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.303
Whenever I build something that
doesn't yet exist,

05:03.386 --> 05:05.179
I try not to reinvent the wheel.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.057
Instead, I look to existing technology

05:08.141 --> 05:10.518
to see what I can cobble together
to make it work.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.563
For this, I've chosen drone technology.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.398
They have high efficiency motors,

05:15.481 --> 05:17.442
it's battery powered, it's perfect.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.069
[screaming]

05:21.696 --> 05:25.575
So, the hover board is gonna have
eight motors in an X configuration.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.540
And they're going to be coaxial,
one right on top of the other.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.045
These 29-inch props rotate at 3,300 RPM.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.215
That's beginning
to look like something.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.426
Something dangerous.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.762
I weigh 145 pounds,

05:45.845 --> 05:49.891
so I need each motor to put out
at least 20 pounds of thrust.

05:51.225 --> 05:54.020
This luggage scale test will tell me
if we're in the zone.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.776
There is a minor possibility that it
will either A, shatter,

06:00.151 --> 06:02.862
or B, become detached
from this motor shaft,

06:03.029 --> 06:04.864
which means this piece of carbon fiber,

06:04.947 --> 06:06.783
will launch at you very, very quickly,

06:06.866 --> 06:09.535
so everybody should be below this height.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.537
Here comes the danger.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.664
Okay, here we go.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.507
Looking good.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.927
All right 6.6, we're only
at 50 percent thrust.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.264
Eight, ten,

06:31.349 --> 06:33.810
twelve, 14,

06:34.310 --> 06:35.311
eighteen,

06:36.729 --> 06:37.563
twenty...

06:39.482 --> 06:41.651
Twenty point three-four pounds.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.697
Excellent.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.037
Twenty point three-four pounds
times eight is a little more than 160.

06:53.121 --> 06:57.458
I weigh 145, which leaves me
a measly 15 pounds

06:57.708 --> 07:00.419
for my batteries
and my carbon fiber body.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.547
That's cutting it close,

07:03.131 --> 07:06.425
so next I want to make sure I have the
optimal motor configuration.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.593
Here we go.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.512
With an airflow test.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.933
Using the flow of smoke,
I run a simulation.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.186
And the results aren't
what I was hoping for.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.107
According to the simulation,

07:23.109 --> 07:25.862
this configuration with the motors,
one on top of the other,

07:26.863 --> 07:31.659
is gonna result in upwards of
15 to 20 percent loss of thrust.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.997
So, now comes the part of my build

07:36.080 --> 07:39.667
where I take everything that I've been
working on, throw it out the window

07:39.750 --> 07:42.628
and go to a flat eight configuration.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.969
That way, thrust number 20.3 pounds
times eight

07:50.470 --> 07:52.680
is exactly the amount of lift
I'm gonna have.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.397
Okay, so here is my hoverboard.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.650
It has a carbon fiber body,
eight brushless motors.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.320
It's powered by lithium polymer batteries.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.823
It has a safety switch.
In case I happen to step off the board,

08:10.907 --> 08:13.284
it'll kill power to
all the motors simultaneously.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.079
Inside this protective dome
are the smarts of the hoverboard.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.917
There's a radio controlled receiver
that gets signals from my transmitter,

08:21.083 --> 08:23.085
it passes those on
to the flight controller.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.714
The flight controller has
an onboard three axis accelerometer.

08:26.797 --> 08:27.798
Ten o'clock.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.176
Along with that sensor data and my input,

08:31.260 --> 08:34.096
it controls all eight motors
simultaneously

08:34.430 --> 08:35.306
Let's do this.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.350
to keep the board hovering.

08:38.351 --> 08:42.188
With all that tech, this could be
an accident waiting to happen.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.481
Okay, here we go.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.482
So, next step,

08:44.690 --> 08:46.609
remote control test flights.

08:46.692 --> 08:50.196
Hoverboard calibration test... number one.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.621
All right, here we go.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.675
Let's try that again.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.846
So, the purpose
of flying test calibration flight

09:15.930 --> 09:17.390
after test calibration flight

09:17.473 --> 09:20.643
is to zero in on the settings
for the flight controller.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.858
By changing the gains
on the flight controller,

09:28.234 --> 09:30.361
I can get it to fly more stable.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.741
And if it's a hoverboard you're after...

09:35.825 --> 09:36.867
Yes.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.328
stability is the holy grail.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.292
[laughing]

09:48.546 --> 09:49.380
I think I'm ready.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.052
My hoverboard has been built from scratch,

09:55.428 --> 09:58.556
using components that are being pushed
to their absolute limit.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.142
It is inherently dangerous.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.729
In fact, it's one of the more dangerous
things I've built in my career,

10:04.812 --> 10:06.105
which says a lot.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.901
A thousand things have to go right,

10:11.485 --> 10:13.613
and if only one thing goes wrong,

10:13.821 --> 10:14.655
I don't fly.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.244
Let's hope a thousand things
go right today.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.914
All right, this is hoverboard
test number one.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.209
Three, two, one.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.804
Now, the cry for where's my hoverboard,
really should be where's my jetpack?

10:39.305 --> 10:43.017
Because that's been around a lot longer
in the sci-fi world than a hoverboard.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.519
Now, take a look
at this super-realistic film.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.939
You walk out your front door,
you got your jetpack on,

10:50.066 --> 10:51.484
you fly over commuter traffic

10:52.777 --> 10:54.695
and land safely at your destination.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.405
There it is, the dream summed up.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.284
Then in the 1960s,
the technology became a reality.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.162
The Rocket Belt.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.793
Hydrogen peroxide,
converted into super-heated steam,

11:08.876 --> 11:10.002
provided the propulsion.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.339
But these early models
had a very limited range

11:13.422 --> 11:14.673
and very short flight time.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.927
They were unstable
and completely dangerous.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.845
Similar to my upbringing.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.433
The technology gradually improved,

11:24.934 --> 11:27.770
culminating in the 1984 L.A. Olympics.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.440
Millions of people thought
that the jetpack commute

11:31.565 --> 11:32.983
was right around the corner.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.569
But for 20 years or so,
technology stalled.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.113
Then in 2010,

11:37.196 --> 11:39.949
Glenn Martin from New Zealand,
developed this.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.579
Now, the Martin Jetpack can fly
at 46 miles an hour

11:46.163 --> 11:48.040
and an altitude of 3,000 feet.

11:48.374 --> 11:52.253
Amongst other uses, it'll be deployed
by emergency first responders

11:52.336 --> 11:54.380
and it could be a game changer.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.299
It's an awesome personal flying device,

11:57.550 --> 12:01.971
but strictly speaking, it's powered
by a two-stroke engine, not jets.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.015
And it's not
that handy backpack-sized gizmo

12:05.099 --> 12:06.392
that sci-fi promised us.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.811
But then, in 2015,

12:09.437 --> 12:10.980
this video went viral.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.400
And my search for a futuristic
jetpack was over.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.653
This is the JB9,

12:19.530 --> 12:23.659
and the pilot is JetPack Aviation's
co-founder, David Mayman.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.579
A lot of people thought it was a fake.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.873
They thought he was
hooked into a helicopter.

12:29.373 --> 12:32.376
So, I wanted to go out
and see it for my own eyes

12:32.460 --> 12:34.670
to make sure
that this technology was real.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.969
Mayman was a hard man to pin down...

12:45.055 --> 12:47.808
wary of letting anyone
too close to his prototype.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.936
Finally, he agreed to meet me
in a remote spot

12:53.230 --> 12:55.399
with his latest model, the JB10.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.946
[Tory] Is that real?
Are my eyes deceiving me?

13:01.030 --> 13:05.534
Oh, man...
You have completed my geek fantasy.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.369
Yeah, I'm excited.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.121
Try it on. Come on.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.122
[laughs]

13:10.706 --> 13:11.832
I'm gonna cry a little.

13:12.541 --> 13:13.667
-[Mayman] Cool.
-Oh, my God.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.378
This is so cool. Where did you come up
with the design?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.547
Nelson Tyler designed
the original rocket belt...

13:18.631 --> 13:20.466
-Okay.
-way back in the '60s and '70s.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.009
-Right
-So, a lot of the concept

13:22.092 --> 13:25.304
in terms of how the thing is put together,
goes back to those days.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.597
How does this thing work?

13:26.680 --> 13:28.265
[Mayman] We got two turbine engines,

13:28.349 --> 13:30.851
like jet airliner engines,
but shrunk down, obviously.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.144
[Tory] Where are the missiles?

13:32.228 --> 13:33.437
[laughing]

13:33.521 --> 13:36.941
And so once you start flying,
how does that feel?

13:37.024 --> 13:40.444
When you take off, the ground just,
whoo, disappears below you.

13:40.736 --> 13:44.240
I mean, for the first time I did it
off the safety tether, it was freaky.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.659
[Tory] Now, what happens
if you have an engine fail?

13:46.742 --> 13:48.285
-You're gonna go down.
-Then what?

13:48.369 --> 13:49.495
Do you have a parachute?

13:49.578 --> 13:51.831
We're building a parachute system,
but not yet.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.166
So, you're only flying over water
at this stage.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.918
-At this stage.
-Okay, that's smart.

13:56.877 --> 14:01.131
[Tory] Mayman hopes that the JB10
will fly at over 100 miles per hour,

14:01.215 --> 14:03.050
at an altitude of 10,000 feet.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.805
God, this thing is awesome.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.349
How awesome? Eleven out of ten.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.768
Ever since I was a kid I wanted a jetpack,

14:12.851 --> 14:15.813
and I think everybody should
commute to work in one of these.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.856
But, because we're not there yet,

14:17.940 --> 14:19.316
I thought it'd be kind of fun

14:19.400 --> 14:22.027
if we raced modern technology

14:22.111 --> 14:23.279
with future technology.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.197
-May the best technology win.
-Cool.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.783
[Tory] This truck is sick.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.913
A supercharged five liter engine
pumps out 700 horse power,

14:33.497 --> 14:34.665
and I plan to use it all.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.378
The course is five miles long.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.756
The rules? I stick to land.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.427
David sticks to water.

14:49.138 --> 14:49.972
Game on.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.521
I am about to race a man in a jetpack.

14:58.439 --> 15:02.776
This guy is a real world Tony Stark,
and I'm gonna race him.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.571
All right, on my count.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.281
[Tory over radio] You're going down.

15:08.949 --> 15:13.037
In three, two, one, go!

15:19.084 --> 15:19.919
[laughing]

15:27.051 --> 15:31.013
Oh, damn, he is flying!

15:32.348 --> 15:33.390
[beeping]

15:40.773 --> 15:42.191
[Tory] News comes over the walkie.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.070
David's having technical problems.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.906
His pit crew are swapping out a turbine.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.577
That doesn't mean I'm stopping to help.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.748
[laughing]

16:01.085 --> 16:03.587
Just as well. David's airborne again.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.550
Even now, that jetpack
could still beat me.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.471
[beeping]

16:13.472 --> 16:16.725
But unlike lightning,
technical gremlins can strike twice.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.189
And I cross the line alone.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.110
That was sick.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.906
[Tory] But when the dust settles,

16:30.990 --> 16:34.576
I realize this is the first race
I've ever been sad to win.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.663
That tiny glimpse of the future
was tantalizing

16:38.372 --> 16:39.206
and I want more.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.211
Luckily, David invites me
back to his headquarters

16:45.379 --> 16:47.715
where his engineers quickly
iron out the problems

16:48.632 --> 16:49.758
He hooks on the safety line.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.885
[Tory] He just started the engines.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.056
Oh, yeah.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.143
That looks so cool, look at that.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.230
It's like standing right next
to a jet plane.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.443
[laughs]

17:09.111 --> 17:10.029
That's a sexy thing.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.450
You have created an actual jetpack.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.248
Yeah!

17:23.125 --> 17:24.626
That is insane.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.379
It's so cool. You flew.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.382
-Is that good? Smoking like that's good?
-Yeah.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.759
-Yeah. It's normal.
-Okay.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.093
-It's cooling down.
-Okay.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.598
[Tory] Jetpack. I'm convinced.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.183
This is working technology.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.517
I saw it with my own eyes.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.146
That flight around the Statue of Liberty
was no trick.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.939
That was 100 percent real.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.735
For half a century,
people have been asking,

17:49.818 --> 17:51.236
"Where's my jetpack?"

17:51.737 --> 17:54.490
I believe that, finally,
that day is so close

17:54.573 --> 17:55.824
we can almost touch it.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.243
That is a day I'm looking forward to.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.707
I want one of these, as far as
the sci-fi promise, that is really close.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.502
I mean, it looks like it flew right out
of a sci-fi movie.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.128
But how much did that cost?

18:08.712 --> 18:10.798
That one is $250,000.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.841
That's like a really fancy car.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.427
-Yeah, it's not cheap.
-[Grant] When are we gonna get them?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.514
You'll probably see these
in one to two years.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.932
Check out my first contender.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.895
A sci-fi prediction
from the original Star Wars.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.359
In 1977, being able to record
a hologram message

18:30.442 --> 18:33.904
and then play it back in thin air
was the radical vision of the future.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.864
"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi."

18:37.407 --> 18:39.660
Princess Leia's famous recorded message

18:39.868 --> 18:43.705
held out the promise that one day
we'd be able to communicate by hologram

18:43.831 --> 18:44.873
in real time.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.667
I wanna see how far we've come

18:46.750 --> 18:48.919
so to discover some hologram basics

18:49.211 --> 18:51.088
I'm starting with a small scale hack.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.298
All I need is a little acrylic,

18:53.382 --> 18:55.884
cutting tool, glue and a tablet.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.222
Just a matter of cutting out
four sides of a rhombus,

19:03.642 --> 19:04.685
sticking them together

19:06.228 --> 19:07.229
and presto!

19:07.729 --> 19:11.233
And now... once I kill the lights,
I'm gonna have a hologram.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.987
This seemingly three-dimensional image

19:15.070 --> 19:18.073
is caused by the reflection
of the globes on my tablet

19:18.157 --> 19:20.033
through the sides of the rhombus.

19:20.117 --> 19:20.951
How cool is that?

19:21.034 --> 19:24.913
It's a cute start
but a long way from that sci-fi promise

19:24.997 --> 19:27.374
of real-time holographic communication.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.420
So, I'm heading for the pros
at Hologram U.S.A.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.589
[trumpets]

19:34.756 --> 19:37.301
Prime mover and shaker is Alki David.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.011
That is fantastic.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.722
What you're seeing now
is, in fact, an illusion.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.516
An age-old illusion.
A 200-year-old parlor trick

19:44.600 --> 19:46.018
called "Pepper's Ghost."

19:47.644 --> 19:49.688
[Kari] Pepper's Ghost
was a theatrical creation

19:49.771 --> 19:52.816
of scientist John Henry Pepper in 1862.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.111
He reflected light off a concealed actor

19:56.195 --> 19:58.655
onto the stage via
an angled sheet of glass,

19:59.031 --> 20:00.699
making her appear like a ghost.

20:02.659 --> 20:06.038
-Modern holograms use film and lasers.
-Roll the camera.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.208
[Kari] A laser light is split
into two paths.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.379
One illuminates the object
and bounces onto a photographic plate.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.008
The second beam,
called a reference beam,

20:18.091 --> 20:20.928
is redirected by the mirrors
onto the same plate.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.514
Where the illumination
and reference beams cross paths,

20:24.890 --> 20:27.309
the interfering light waves
create a light field

20:27.392 --> 20:29.186
which is now captured on film.

20:31.104 --> 20:31.980
Give me five.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.566
[Kari] So, while it looks like
I'm talking to the real Alki...

20:34.650 --> 20:36.026
This is so weird.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.571
in fact it's his holographic film image,

20:39.947 --> 20:41.365
projected through this foil.

20:41.865 --> 20:46.453
Very powerful projectors project an image
reflected through an invisible foil

20:46.954 --> 20:48.538
and gives you, the audience,

20:48.622 --> 20:51.708
the illusion that
I'm standing here, but I'm not.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.129
-[tiger growls]
-[Kari laughs]

20:57.130 --> 20:58.674
And now there's a tiger.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.094
-And-- And now you're actually here.
-I'm actually here.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.637
[laughs]

21:04.137 --> 21:05.973
[roars]

21:06.890 --> 21:08.517
[Kari] With all this cool tech on hand,

21:08.600 --> 21:12.396
I can't resist the opportunity
to become a hologram myself.

21:12.938 --> 21:13.939
Action, Kari.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.108
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

21:16.942 --> 21:18.402
♪ Gently down the stream ♪

21:18.485 --> 21:20.153
[Kari] In fact, several holograms.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.947
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪

21:22.531 --> 21:23.949
While my Kari clones are being made,

21:24.866 --> 21:26.576
let's see how this contender scores.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.913
First, how close are we
to the sci-fi promise?

21:30.789 --> 21:33.959
Well, I did have a real-time conversation
with Alki's hologram,

21:34.835 --> 21:38.422
but we had to be in his studio to do it,
so five out of ten.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.009
Second,
how much does this technology cost?

21:42.592 --> 21:45.846
Alki's setup would set you back
a cool half million bucks.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.973
Cut. Perfect.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.933
[Kari] Third, when can I get one?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.519
Unless the laws of physics change, never.

21:52.602 --> 21:56.398
You can make images float
near a holographic display device

21:56.606 --> 21:57.774
but not in thin air.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.277
So, this could be as good as it gets.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.904
Which one's the real me?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.032
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪

22:05.699 --> 22:07.659
What, is it getting too real for you?

22:08.160 --> 22:11.705
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream ♪

22:12.497 --> 22:14.624
[Grant]
We're investigating six contenders

22:14.708 --> 22:17.544
to see which famous promises
from science fiction

22:17.753 --> 22:19.212
are closest to coming true.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.672
Which reminds me...

22:21.173 --> 22:22.674
Where's my hoverboard?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.801
Back to the Future promised,

22:25.469 --> 22:27.804
but despite a proliferation of prototypes,

22:27.888 --> 22:30.974
this elusive future tech
has yet to hit the street.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.392
Still waiting.

22:33.226 --> 22:37.314
And, given how obsessed I am,
I had to build one myself.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.400
Yes.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.320
I've done my remote control
calibration tests.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.322
I've run the diagnostics.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.867
Now for the human factor.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.286
Will it be Granty McFly?

22:52.329 --> 22:53.413
Or Granty McDie?

22:54.873 --> 22:57.918
All right hoverboard test number one,
powering up transmitter.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.464
Powering up flight controller.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.424
Okay.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.803
Power up motors.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.515
Idling up.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.896
All right, this is hoverboard
test number one.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.650
Three, two, one.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.121
I'm not sure if the problem is thrust,

23:40.001 --> 23:40.836
or stability,

23:43.672 --> 23:44.840
or pilot error.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.300
-Okay.
-Let's try that again.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.553
This is hoverboard test number two.

23:51.888 --> 23:52.973
Up! Up!

23:54.975 --> 23:58.854
So, I'm not quite getting off the ground,
but I feel like I am so close.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.398
[yelps]

24:04.901 --> 24:08.405
This is extremely difficult
to try and fly.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.200
[screams]

24:14.619 --> 24:15.662
Damn it!

24:15.745 --> 24:18.498
What I think my issue is here is thrust.

24:19.958 --> 24:20.834
Here we go.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.005
We are pushing these motors
and batteries and speed controls

24:25.088 --> 24:26.673
to their absolute limit.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.719
And the bottom line
is if you don't have enough thrust,

24:31.011 --> 24:32.345
you're not getting off the ground.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.598
Back to the drawing board.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.690
[Tory] My next contender
comes straight out of Star Trek.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.943
Here,
at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine,

24:47.027 --> 24:48.361
doctors are pioneering

24:48.445 --> 24:50.989
a futuristic wound healing technology.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.951
Later, stitches. Hello, lasers.

24:55.952 --> 24:58.788
This is like real sci-fi in practice.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.665
You see this stuff in the movies.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.459
I wanna see this technology work.

25:03.293 --> 25:07.506
[woman on PA] Paging Dr. Belleci,
you're parked in the wrong spot again.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.132
He's not gonna make it.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.258
[phone rings]

25:11.760 --> 25:13.303
Yeah. Cancel all my appointments.

25:15.513 --> 25:16.681
Doctor.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.600
-Doctor.
-Doctor.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.227
-Doctor.
-Doctor.

25:20.393 --> 25:21.978
-And doctor.
-Nope.

25:22.062 --> 25:25.148
Oh, perfect, I thought I was
the only one that wasn't a doctor.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.860
Now, we have some tissue here.
What is the tissue from?

25:28.944 --> 25:30.528
[Kochevar] This is swine skin.

25:30.612 --> 25:34.407
And we use swine skin 'cause it's very
much structurally the same as human skin,

25:34.491 --> 25:37.577
so we can predict what might happen
in human skin.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.038
And everybody loves bacon.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.002
-Mark, wanna start?
-All right.

25:49.422 --> 25:52.092
[Mark] So, now we've made an incision,
as you can see.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.219
And then we have to apply the dye.

25:54.302 --> 25:57.013
[Kochevar]
We put a dye on the two surfaces.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.767
The dye sticks to those fibers
that are in the tissue.

26:01.309 --> 26:04.437
And if you would just dab it
into the wound--

26:06.940 --> 26:09.442
- How's that?
-[Randolph] That's great. Perfect.

26:09.526 --> 26:12.737
And now we need to put on
our safety glasses for the laser.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.240
We're making sutures with lasers.

26:16.449 --> 26:19.411
[Randolph] So, Matt's gonna place
one of his biodegradable waveguides,

26:19.911 --> 26:21.913
delivering the light into the wound.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.875
[Randolph] Depending upon the tissue
and the tissue depth,

26:25.959 --> 26:29.212
it could take as little as
45 seconds to a minute.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.007
And maybe as long as three minutes.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.801
See, I was expecting to see smoke,
hear zapping.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.595
Like, you point a laser
and just be like,

26:36.678 --> 26:38.054
[mimics laser firing]

26:38.138 --> 26:39.848
and you fixed the wound.

26:39.931 --> 26:40.765
That was Star Wars.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.934
-[all laugh]
-[Tory] That's the future.

26:43.935 --> 26:46.354
The waveguide is a light delivery device,

26:46.438 --> 26:50.442
like an optic fiber, that can be tailored
to the size of the wound.

26:51.359 --> 26:54.863
[Randolph] So, now we think that the wound
is sealed, we can turn the laser off.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.283
And what we do at the end is we actually
just snip

26:58.700 --> 27:00.160
the waveguide off.

27:01.244 --> 27:02.954
[Tory] It's a biodegradable polymer

27:03.038 --> 27:05.081
which will simply dissolve in the body.

27:05.498 --> 27:06.583
That's incredible.

27:06.666 --> 27:10.462
So, would you rather have this
on your face or this?

27:10.545 --> 27:11.379
Neither.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.298
[all laughing]

27:13.381 --> 27:14.674
And it's so fast.

27:14.758 --> 27:18.219
I mean, I guess that's really what this is
all about, is speeding up

27:18.345 --> 27:19.846
that process of closing a wound.

27:19.929 --> 27:22.474
With something like this,
you can get it done in seconds.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.477
We're not just talking about
mending flesh wounds.

27:27.354 --> 27:30.273
Injuries that have maimed
and crippled in the past,

27:30.774 --> 27:32.984
could be small potatoes in the future.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.987
-[Randolph] I'm gonna lay this on here.
-[Tory] Take this severed nerve.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.449
I just feel like we're missing something.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.077
Wrap it in biomaterial.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.454
Now we are getting ready to use the laser.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.039
[Tory] Zap it.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.794
We're fixing nerves with lasers.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.171
Watch it regenerate before your eyes.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.549
How about a gut wound?

27:57.050 --> 27:58.093
[grunting]

27:59.636 --> 28:00.595
No problem.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.432
Vahe is gonna actually
make an incision into the colon

28:04.516 --> 28:06.685
that would be typical of a knife wound.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.229
[Tory] It'll be as easy to mend
as a bicycle flat.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.856
Except this tire is full of crap.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.193
First, they insert
and then inflate a balloon

28:15.276 --> 28:17.737
to give the colon section
a realistic shape.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.240
There's something you don't see every day.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.784
Patch the hole with stem cell material,

28:22.867 --> 28:26.454
cover with dye, and hit it
with the laser for 10 minutes.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.747
Laser on.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.333
I've done some weird stuff in my time,

28:30.417 --> 28:33.169
but patching a pig's colon
is definitely up there.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.505
Okay, it's sealed.

28:37.424 --> 28:38.550
[squeaks]

28:38.633 --> 28:39.718
Hey, it farted.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.428
Look at that.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.099
All right, time to go for it.

28:46.599 --> 28:49.018
Test how strong it is
by filling it with water

28:49.102 --> 28:52.772
until either the patch,
or the colon, bursts.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.568
It's game of chicken using a pig's colon.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.027
Everybody's getting nervous.

28:59.779 --> 29:00.739
She's gonna blow!

29:00.822 --> 29:03.032
If you have this much pressure
in your intestine

29:03.116 --> 29:05.702
-She can't take much more, captain!
-[Tory laughs]

29:06.828 --> 29:07.746
[Tory] You're already dead.

29:08.538 --> 29:09.706
[all] Whoa!

29:14.919 --> 29:15.754
You win.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.216
This technology feels like
it's stepped out of Star Trek.

29:20.300 --> 29:24.387
Like the dermal regenerator, they're using
light waves to actually heal wounds.

29:26.222 --> 29:30.560
This is a perfect example of
science fiction inspiring real science.

29:30.643 --> 29:34.147
[woman on PA] Dr. Belleci,
would you please move your car?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.941
How close to the sci-fi promise are they?

29:37.025 --> 29:40.153
Well, they are using lasers
to close wounds.

29:40.236 --> 29:43.656
Even though it's not instantaneous
like the dermal regenerator.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.742
That's cool. How much does it cost?

29:45.825 --> 29:48.161
Anything in the medical field
is gonna be pretty expensive,

29:48.244 --> 29:49.996
so you should probably get insurance.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.664
How soon is it gonna be available?

29:51.748 --> 29:54.751
They are still waiting for FDA approval,
so they're still a few years off.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.880
Speaking of medical procedures,
I've been investigating a few of my own.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.675
[man 1] Lining rocket arm switch is on.
Here's the throttle. Circuit breaker's in.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.721
[man 2] Steve Austin, a man barely alive.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.141
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.

30:10.725 --> 30:14.604
We have the capability to make
the world's first bionic man.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.567
[Grant] I will be that man.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.528
Better than I was before.

30:24.697 --> 30:26.157
Better.

30:27.033 --> 30:27.867
Stronger.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.160
[whirring]

30:30.328 --> 30:31.204
Faster.

30:33.248 --> 30:37.252
Back in 1973, on one of the greatest
television shows of all time,

30:37.460 --> 30:42.257
they built Steve Austin two new legs,
one new arm, and one eye,

30:42.340 --> 30:45.844
and now, over 40 years later,
I have just one question:

30:46.386 --> 30:48.972
Where's my six million dollar man, man?

30:49.347 --> 30:50.974
Where's my cyborg body?

30:53.184 --> 30:54.310
Can I get some new abs?

30:56.312 --> 30:57.856
First on my shopping list:

30:58.773 --> 31:00.692
One bionic arm.

31:04.445 --> 31:08.324
Looks like I've hit the bull's-eye
right off the bat with real-life cyborg,

31:08.408 --> 31:09.492
Angel Giuffria.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.578
So, how do you control the arm?

31:11.661 --> 31:13.371
It's actually easy for me to control.

31:13.454 --> 31:17.417
I have two sensors that sit on my skin,
so when I flex and extend those muscles,

31:17.500 --> 31:19.335
it allows me to open and close the hand.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.839
It's pretty much one of the most
top-of-the-line hands on the market,

31:22.922 --> 31:26.342
which is really exciting.
I do like a quick flick up with my arm

31:26.718 --> 31:29.053
and it lets me switch
to a different grip pattern.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.930
So, how many grip patterns do you have?

31:31.014 --> 31:33.975
-My power grip is the really good one.
-Yes.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.977
-Which I can use to--
-Punch people.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.438
Not just for punching people,
I promise.

31:38.521 --> 31:40.440
-It would be cool if it shot off.
-Yeah.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.066
I can help you with that.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.069
But I have my lateral grip pattern,

31:45.153 --> 31:48.197
and then, if I press this button,

31:48.781 --> 31:50.116
now I have my open precision,

31:50.199 --> 31:53.912
which I can use to pick up a key or a dime
or anything like that

31:55.538 --> 31:56.372
and pick it up.

31:58.958 --> 32:03.129
That is amazing, it's actually better than
I could do because I suck at cooking.

32:05.673 --> 32:06.549
[laughs]

32:07.050 --> 32:08.635
You made that look so easy.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.553
[Angel] A little bit goes into it.

32:10.637 --> 32:15.016
There are five motors and they are housed
internally into the palm of the hand.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.518
I see that they're kind of spring-loaded.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.730
Yeah, it's really great to have.
It makes it look more natural, too.

32:20.813 --> 32:24.067
[Grant] Steve Austin's arm
had the power of a bulldozer.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.486
Angel's provides no strength enhancement,

32:26.569 --> 32:31.157
but it has the advantage of coming with
an array of useful attachments.

32:31.240 --> 32:35.286
As an electrical engineer,
as a robotics expert, animatronics expert,

32:35.787 --> 32:38.414
I am so excited to see your hand.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.875
-I'm excited that I have my hand.
-That's amazing.

32:41.376 --> 32:45.004
And I'm stoked because later Angel's
gonna show me how to control it myself.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.048
Then we'll see how it scores.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.842
But first, I need an eye.

32:50.259 --> 32:54.639
Steve Austin's bionic eye gave him
an incredible 20-to-1 zoom.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.060
So, what vision-enhancing cyborg tech
has science come up with?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.231
Check out this guy.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.568
Neil Harbisson was born
with extreme color blindness.

33:08.152 --> 33:12.115
So, he got doctors to implant
an antenna in his brain.

33:12.657 --> 33:17.036
[Neil] My antenna is a body part,
and it allows me to hear colors.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.623
It sends the light frequencies
to a chip at the back of my head,

33:20.707 --> 33:24.168
and then the chip transposes
the colors into sound waves.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.173
I don't feel that I am using technology,
I feel that I am technology.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.050
I am a cyborg.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.760
And that's how I feel.

33:33.761 --> 33:37.515
[Grant] That's one awesome implant,
but like Steve Austin's doctors,

33:37.598 --> 33:42.061
mine are scouring the planet
for tech that can restore lost sight.

33:43.146 --> 33:46.774
Jeroen Perk, from Holland,
went blind at age 19.

33:47.316 --> 33:50.570
I lost 80-90 percent of my visual field.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.240
[Grant]
Now a retinal implant prosthesis system

33:54.323 --> 33:57.785
has restored enough vision
for him to take to the slopes.

33:59.787 --> 34:02.540
A miniature camera in
the bridge of his glasses

34:02.623 --> 34:06.586
sends visual information
to a small computer worn on his hip.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.340
The computer processes the data,
and sends it back to the retinal implant,

34:11.549 --> 34:14.677
which fires electrical impulses
along the optic nerve

34:14.886 --> 34:18.264
to the brain, allowing him
to perceive patterns of light.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.892
It's-- It's a miracle.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.936
[Grant]
There's no Steve Austin zoom function yet,

34:24.979 --> 34:29.108
but that's a genuine bionic eye
at 150,000 bucks.

34:30.318 --> 34:33.071
Okay, arm, eye,

34:33.571 --> 34:34.781
now legs.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.658
Seeing as I'm currently under the knife,

34:37.742 --> 34:41.412
I've asked Kari to dig me out
some new ones to put me in the fast lane.

34:46.667 --> 34:47.835
[Keahi] On your left.

34:48.377 --> 34:49.712
[Kari] Stop saying it!

34:51.589 --> 34:54.300
-[Keahi] On your left.
-[Kari] Stop saying it!

34:55.927 --> 34:56.803
On your left.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.971
Come on!

34:59.472 --> 35:01.641
Hard to believe, but it's been 30 years

35:01.724 --> 35:04.477
since the final episode
of the Six Million Dollar Man aired.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.313
Now, with all that modern technology
has to offer,

35:07.563 --> 35:10.066
how close are we to that
six million dollar promise?

35:10.650 --> 35:11.609
On your left.

35:12.401 --> 35:13.778
I guess I'm about to find out.

35:13.861 --> 35:17.615
This strangely-shod demi-bot
is Keahi Seymour

35:18.699 --> 35:21.619
Creator of the aptly-named bionic boots.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.788
Better chase him down!

35:25.081 --> 35:28.501
Sorry I'm late. I have, like, normal feet.
So boring.

35:28.584 --> 35:31.087
-These are sick!
-Ever since I've been a child,

35:31.170 --> 35:34.674
I just wanna make a human run faster,
so I looked towards fast land animals.

35:34.757 --> 35:38.344
Initially, I got the first inspiration
from how kangaroos were storing energy

35:38.427 --> 35:42.682
in their Achilles tendons. Then I looked
towards a fast bipedal animal, the ostrich

35:42.765 --> 35:46.936
so they run up to 45 miles an hour.
So, then I researched the horse, cheetah,

35:47.019 --> 35:51.399
and see how I could make a device you'd
strap to a human to make them run faster.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.694
Usain Bolt tops out
at about 27.4 miles an hour

35:55.278 --> 35:57.113
at a fleeting moment
in the 100 meter sprint.

35:57.196 --> 36:00.700
I wanna try and keep that sprinting speed
for a prolonged period.

36:00.783 --> 36:03.578
[Kari] Keahi has been evolving
his bionic boots for years

36:04.078 --> 36:08.708
with the key elements being tough rubber
springs to mimic animal Achilles tendons.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.668
with a spring-loaded toe

36:11.210 --> 36:12.837
and mountain bike tire for grip.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.423
I'm always trying to hone
the weight of the boots down.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.717
This is
the current prototype we have here,

36:18.301 --> 36:22.346
all fiber glass exoskeleton shell with
aircraft-grade aluminum

36:24.140 --> 36:28.477
My idea for the future is actually trying
to add some sort of actuator

36:28.561 --> 36:30.605
to give you a boost to
each of your stride.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.358
I'm rocking at about, like,
10 to 12 to 15 feet.

36:34.442 --> 36:37.069
I wanna increase it to about
a stride length of 25 foot.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.529
That's the same as an ostrich.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.533
-I'll be rolling at 45 miles an hour.
-That's crazy.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.828
And it's closing in on
Steve Austin's 60 miles per hour.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.872
You're planning to take this to market.

36:47.955 --> 36:51.292
[Keahi] Absolutely. I gotta get everyone
to feel the sensation of being bionic.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.211
It's spectacular,
when you put the boots on.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.255
[Kari] Keahi assures me
that they're easy to use.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.133
I feel like I wish I was,
you know, like 12.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.801
-[grunting]
-[Keahi laughs]

37:01.636 --> 37:03.846
Guess I'll just have to take
his word for it.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.389
[laughs]

37:06.182 --> 37:07.642
Right. Let's talk about the criteria.

37:08.643 --> 37:12.521
They're not available quite yet,
but they're getting really close.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.107
I mean, these prototypes are
almost ready for market.

37:15.524 --> 37:19.237
The price point on them is gonna be
around what a bicycle would cost.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.573
And finally, how close are we to
the six million dollar man?

37:22.657 --> 37:26.160
Well, we're not at 60 miles an hour yet,
but we're getting really close.

37:27.620 --> 37:28.913
[Grant] Bionic boots?

37:29.288 --> 37:30.122
Check.

37:31.791 --> 37:35.795
Now I just need a helping hand to wrap
things up, and luckily,

37:35.920 --> 37:37.296
Angel brought in a spare,

37:37.380 --> 37:41.092
so I could get a feel for exactly what
it's like to control a cyborg limb.

37:41.175 --> 37:42.760
-Let's get you hooked up.
-Okay.

37:46.013 --> 37:47.431
So, try to close your hand.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.058
There you go.

37:49.809 --> 37:50.643
And then open.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.313
Like we're twins.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.648
That's amazing.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.733
Why don't you try
to flick your wrist up.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.485
All right, now close.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.946
-Good job.
-Hey! I'm number one!

38:02.029 --> 38:03.489
You just changed grip patterns.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.659
You're pretty good at this.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.495
I hope you know
I'm not giving this back.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.747
The future is now!

38:13.249 --> 38:16.585
Angel's bionic arm retails for $30,000.

38:17.253 --> 38:21.924
So, how does our real-life Steve Austin
body parts package score overall?

38:22.633 --> 38:25.136
Welcome to our personal archery range.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.265
First, how close are we
to the sci-fi promise?

38:30.099 --> 38:31.100
Good shot.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.978
Well, pretty close.

38:34.061 --> 38:37.940
Technology can't yet create
a Steve Austin-style superman,

38:40.359 --> 38:41.986
but we really could rebuild him.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.572
The total cost of our cyborg package

38:44.655 --> 38:47.408
slashes that six million dollar
price tag

38:47.491 --> 38:50.661
to just $186,000.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.331
And when can I get all this tech?

38:53.414 --> 38:56.625
Well, the arm and eyes
are available right now.

38:56.709 --> 38:57.960
And the bionic boots?

38:58.252 --> 39:00.588
-On your left!
-[Grant] They're on their way.

39:00.671 --> 39:04.175
-So, the future is soon.
-Yeah, I hope so.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.388
[Kari] All right, we've selected
six sci-fi promises

39:09.472 --> 39:11.891
to see which one is the closest
to being realized.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.268
And for my next contender,

39:14.810 --> 39:16.854
I feel like I have the granddaddy
of them all.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.648
X-ray specs.

39:20.274 --> 39:23.819
The X-Ray specs were a really cool
sci-fi promise.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.240
Imagine you're a 10-year-old boy,
you love Superman,

39:28.324 --> 39:30.451
you wanna be able to
see through brick walls, too.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.954
You could find out
what everyone was up to.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.873
But say you're just a little bit older,

39:35.956 --> 39:39.502
you're probably less interested
in seeing through brick walls,

39:40.086 --> 39:43.547
and more interested in seeing through--
Here put these on!

39:46.675 --> 39:48.219
Like a lady in her underwear.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.512
Super hot.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.513
It's what I wear.

39:52.348 --> 39:56.769
So, why do these state-of-the-art
$1.50 spectacles fail to deliver?

39:57.103 --> 40:00.481
You won't be surprised to learn that
there's no actual X-ray involved.

40:00.564 --> 40:01.649
Okay, enough of this.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.569
In fact,
the secret ingredient is a feather,

40:05.653 --> 40:07.780
pressed between two layers of cardboard.

40:07.863 --> 40:12.284
The feather diffracts the light,
so you see two slightly offset images.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.329
Distorted vision, yes.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.164
X-ray? No.

40:18.124 --> 40:22.711
Now, there is one technology that gets us
closer to the promise of the X-ray specs

40:22.795 --> 40:25.423
and that's the backscatter X-rays
at the airport.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.050
Less powerful than normal X-rays,

40:28.676 --> 40:31.345
they penetrated your clothing
about an inch into your body,

40:32.096 --> 40:34.890
creating what looked like nude images.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.018
This created a pretty big stink
when it was introduced

40:38.102 --> 40:42.064
because people did not really appreciate
their privates going so public,

40:42.648 --> 40:47.027
but it's also not wearable,
and it also has a $100,000 price tag.

40:47.528 --> 40:51.574
So, who, I ask,
is going to lead us from the opaque past

40:51.657 --> 40:53.659
and into the transparent future?

40:54.118 --> 40:56.245
Well, we might have a breakthrough.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.665
After years of R and D, the Evena company
has come out with this.

40:59.748 --> 41:03.210
They're Eyes-On Glasses that look through
the skin, down to the veins beneath.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.671
They're for medical use, not a gimmick.

41:06.172 --> 41:09.133
-How do these glasses work?
-Okay, so what they do is they use

41:09.216 --> 41:12.011
four different spectrum in near infrared.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.555
It's not X-ray glasses per se?

41:14.638 --> 41:16.599
It's near infrared.
It's safer than X-ray.

41:16.682 --> 41:19.602
-But you still can't see underwear?
-Correct, no underwear.

41:19.685 --> 41:22.521
Yeah, that's not really
the sci-fi promise.

41:23.105 --> 41:25.608
-Okay, so just put these guys on?
-Exactly.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.986
-I see-- Whoa, okay.
-Yeah, it's a little weird.

41:30.237 --> 41:31.363
Whoa.

41:32.072 --> 41:34.575
That's crazy, my veins are black!

41:35.159 --> 41:36.994
This is some vampire blood going here.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.998
So, what was the inspiration
for creating these glasses?

41:41.290 --> 41:44.043
[Kim] One of the founders of the company
was a military official,

41:44.126 --> 41:46.879
and he saw a lot of combat victims come in
without IV access.

41:46.962 --> 41:51.217
[Kari] Combat victims were the inspiration
so they could place IVs properly.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.927
-[Kim] Exactly.
-I love that.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.470
[Kim] Yeah, it's pretty cool.

41:54.970 --> 41:58.307
Very stylish if you're in X-Men, right?

41:58.390 --> 41:59.975
So, how does this one score?

42:00.476 --> 42:02.728
This is an amazing wearable technology,

42:03.229 --> 42:06.273
but we're looking at
the sci-fi promise of X-ray specs.

42:07.691 --> 42:11.612
These infrared medical specs can see
veins, but ladies' underwear?

42:11.695 --> 42:13.072
That's as safe as ever.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.533
They don't deliver on criteria one.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.993
At a competitive $10,000,

42:18.077 --> 42:20.204
they'll score better
in the cost rankings

42:20.788 --> 42:24.625
But nobody's seriously trying to invent
those pervy peeking specs,

42:25.125 --> 42:27.419
so, chances are, you'll never see them.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.308
Now when I first tried this,

42:41.392 --> 42:44.979
I calculated I would have
just enough thrust to get off the ground.

42:45.104 --> 42:48.524
Obviously, I was wrong.
So, when I went back to the drawing board,

42:49.108 --> 42:51.944
I doubled the motors.
I doubled the battery capacity.

42:52.027 --> 42:56.907
I added 160 pounds of thrust. I replaced
all the carbon fiber arms with aluminum.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.951
This is not elegant.

42:59.535 --> 43:00.703
It's not efficient.

43:01.161 --> 43:02.746
This is brute force.

43:02.830 --> 43:06.166
And if this fails today,
it won't be because of the machine,

43:06.625 --> 43:07.710
it'll be because of me.

43:12.715 --> 43:16.010
Remember, this is
the White Rabbit Project.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.720
No chickening out.

43:25.477 --> 43:26.979
Okay, here we go.

43:54.381 --> 43:55.424
Yes!

43:56.342 --> 43:57.926
There's your hoverboard!

43:59.428 --> 44:01.972
-Thank you.
-[all cheering]

44:04.350 --> 44:05.392
[laughs]

44:08.020 --> 44:11.940
This one's a long road.
It was a lot of nights and weekends

44:12.608 --> 44:16.028
working on this,
and I did almost give up.

44:17.613 --> 44:21.450
When you're taking off,
that is the hardest part because

44:21.533 --> 44:24.703
you need to give it enough thrust,
just enough to get off the ground,

44:24.787 --> 44:26.705
and if I'm not careful with it,

44:26.789 --> 44:29.875
it will send me into the ceiling,
instantly.

44:31.710 --> 44:34.463
So, that is probably the scariest part.

44:34.546 --> 44:36.674
Beyond that,
once I'm in the air and stable,

44:37.257 --> 44:39.718
you just have to keep the balance,
feel the board.

44:42.054 --> 44:43.972
I spent four weeks making this thing,

44:44.056 --> 44:45.849
including all of
the research and development,

44:45.933 --> 44:47.685
starting from ground zero.

44:48.102 --> 44:51.438
How close is it to the sci-fi promise?

44:52.231 --> 44:54.108
Did you not see me hovering?

44:55.609 --> 44:57.569
It cost about $20,000.

44:58.070 --> 45:01.865
Pretty minimal compared to some
of the boards in the world,

45:01.949 --> 45:04.868
which they won't even release a price.

45:05.536 --> 45:08.455
Thank you very much. [laughs]

45:08.539 --> 45:09.748
When is it available?

45:10.457 --> 45:12.626
Well, if you really wanted one,

45:13.293 --> 45:15.003
I could make you one in about a week.

45:16.797 --> 45:20.926
[laughs] Okay, there's your hoverboard,
and I'm still alive.

45:21.009 --> 45:24.179
That looks fun. Can you come over
this weekend? I need my lawn mowed.

45:24.263 --> 45:25.305
[Grant] Yes.

45:25.389 --> 45:26.557
[laughing]

45:26.640 --> 45:28.016
The future is now.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.811
[Kari]
We've looked at six sci-fi predictions.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.312
Fixing nerves with lasers.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.524
[Kari] Now let's see which one
is the closest to being realized

45:36.108 --> 45:37.651
using our three criteria:

45:39.069 --> 45:40.779
How close is it to the sci-fi promise?

45:41.363 --> 45:42.656
How much does it cost?

45:43.240 --> 45:44.491
And when can I get one?

45:45.659 --> 45:47.619
In sixth place: hologram.

45:48.954 --> 45:51.832
-Holographic communication is a way off...
-Give me five.

45:52.082 --> 45:55.627
and it was the most expensive
of all our contenders.

45:57.045 --> 45:59.423
At number five: X-ray specs.

45:59.506 --> 46:01.592
This contender was great for seeing veins.

46:01.675 --> 46:03.510
This is some vampire blood going here.

46:03.594 --> 46:07.931
But underwear stays out of sight for now
and the foreseeable future.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.141
It's hot.

46:09.349 --> 46:10.392
On your left.

46:10.476 --> 46:11.351
[Kari] At four,

46:12.227 --> 46:15.939
our cyborg tech body parts undercut
the six million dollar man in price.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.524
Can I get some new abs?

46:17.608 --> 46:19.234
[Kari] But while they're all awesome,

46:19.318 --> 46:21.820
they can't match Steve Austin's
fantasy powers.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.823
At three: the jetpack.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.116
I think I'm gonna cry.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.077
[Kari]
This futuristic icon is almost a reality,

46:29.453 --> 46:31.622
but you'd have to be Tony Stark
to afford one.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.916
That is insane!

46:34.625 --> 46:37.544
[Kari] In second place:
the Dermal Regenerator.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.713
I just feel like we're missing something.

46:39.796 --> 46:43.592
[Kari] This Star Trek-inspired device
was very close to the sci-fi promise.

46:44.176 --> 46:46.136
Live long and laser-suture.

46:46.678 --> 46:47.596
[all] Whoa!

46:48.263 --> 46:50.807
[Kari] And at number one:
the hoverboard.

46:52.267 --> 46:55.354
Call us biased,
but while Grant's creation is a prototype,

46:56.396 --> 46:59.024
it's a board, it hovers,
and it's here.

46:59.107 --> 47:00.567
There's your hoverboard.

47:02.945 --> 47:05.447
[Kari]
And that's how our contenders stacked up.

47:06.615 --> 47:10.160
So, what do you think? Have we arrived?
Do we have what we've been wanting?

47:10.244 --> 47:11.078
[Kari] No.

47:11.161 --> 47:14.289
I thought by the time I'd be a grown up,
I'd be in my flying car.

47:14.373 --> 47:19.044
Look at everything we do have, including
the super computer in your pocket.

47:19.127 --> 47:23.298
Did you not see that jetpack? It looks
like it flew right out of a sci-fi movie.

47:23.465 --> 47:26.176
Yeah, when I get one,
I'll feel like the future.
