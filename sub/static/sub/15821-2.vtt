WEBVTT

00:05.015 --> 00:07.139
You sure I can't give you
a hand with some of that ?

00:07.145 --> 00:08.599
No, thanks.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.081
I packed these boxes so
one person could carry them.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.930
It's a good thing, too, huh ?

00:18.265 --> 00:20.250
You're mad at me about this ?

00:20.255 --> 00:22.456
I took 2 days off so I
could move in with you,

00:22.498 --> 00:24.029
and you're leaving.

00:24.035 --> 00:26.757
A juror dropped dead during deliberations

00:26.765 --> 00:29.171
of an... an important murder trial.

00:29.176 --> 00:30.830
How could I have known
this was gonna happen ?

00:30.851 --> 00:32.197
An important murder trial ?

00:32.206 --> 00:33.710
You don't even know
who the defendant is.

00:33.726 --> 00:34.898
Yes, I do.

00:34.896 --> 00:36.032
I do so.

00:37.747 --> 00:40.092
It's an armenian mob guy.

00:40.097 --> 00:43.021
- I say his name wrong.
- Aram Asourian.

00:43.206 --> 00:45.500
You remember that nasty
nightclub fire a few years ago ?

00:45.527 --> 00:48.290
Somebody poured gasoline all over
the place, nailed the door shut,

00:48.308 --> 00:50.372
and two people burned to death ?

00:50.387 --> 00:52.190
Where, uh, do you want this ?

00:52.208 --> 00:53.890
Oh, sergeant Gabriel, I'm sorry.

00:53.908 --> 00:56.172
You can't unload boxes
from Fritz's U-Haul.

00:56.177 --> 00:56.972
Why not ?

00:56.986 --> 00:59.811
Apparently the legal system wants
me to move in here by myself.

01:01.287 --> 01:02.793
You're on duty,

01:02.805 --> 01:04.551
and department regulations prohibit

01:04.555 --> 01:06.982
your performing private
labor for a superior.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.450
Pardon me, please.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.670
I get that look, too, sometimes.

01:18.275 --> 01:20.301
That is not a good look.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

01:34.397 --> 01:37.260
No one went into or
out of the jury room

01:37.277 --> 01:39.872
except the Bailiff who
brought them their lunch.

01:39.898 --> 01:41.710
The juror had a heart attack,

01:41.746 --> 01:42.700
period.

01:43.816 --> 01:46.130
Lieutenant Flynn, why
exactly did you designate

01:46.137 --> 01:47.630
the jury room a crime scene ?

01:47.648 --> 01:50.043
Because in Mr. Asourian's first trial,

01:50.058 --> 01:51.780
the prosecution's eyewitness

01:51.808 --> 01:54.100
had his head blown off
before he could testify.

01:54.378 --> 01:56.402
And now we're through
this whole mess again.

01:56.418 --> 01:58.040
A juror dies just as they're about

01:58.055 --> 01:59.483
to deliver a guilty verdict.

01:59.496 --> 02:01.280
A guilty verdict. I doubt that.

02:01.326 --> 02:02.651
Well, I don't.

02:02.907 --> 02:04.881
Mr. Millbrook has a point

02:04.907 --> 02:07.832
when he says the poor lady
died of natural causes,

02:07.846 --> 02:09.991
and that's why we
have alternate jurors.

02:10.056 --> 02:12.302
Yeah ? Well, we're down to one.

02:12.606 --> 02:15.051
Why do we have only
one alternate juror ?

02:15.418 --> 02:17.830
Because a juror dropped
out after some jerk

02:17.868 --> 02:20.602
with an armenian accent
called the courthouse

02:20.898 --> 02:23.331
and threatened to slit the throats

02:23.535 --> 02:25.452
of anyone who voted guilty

02:25.528 --> 02:27.362
- against this creep here.
- Excuse me !

02:27.375 --> 02:29.192
Was this woman's throat cut ?

02:29.286 --> 02:31.621
No ! She had a massive coronary

02:31.626 --> 02:33.421
with 11 other people looking on.

02:33.606 --> 02:36.123
Or her lunch was poisoned.

02:36.288 --> 02:37.170
That's it.

02:37.235 --> 02:39.471
You've just turned what
should've been a personal tragedy

02:39.478 --> 02:41.190
into a motion for a mistrial.

02:44.855 --> 02:46.691
Asourian is a major player

02:46.698 --> 02:48.213
in organized crime.

02:48.388 --> 02:50.240
The LAPD has dedicated

02:50.245 --> 02:51.942
an enormous amount of resources

02:51.956 --> 02:54.151
helping the D.A.
obtain this conviction.

02:54.448 --> 02:56.462
We don't want a mistrial here.

02:56.878 --> 02:58.000
Chief...

02:58.607 --> 03:00.443
this is not a crime scene.

03:00.587 --> 03:01.671
Chief...

03:02.526 --> 03:04.653
I promise you it is.

03:09.946 --> 03:12.890
Well, commander, I'm here.
I might as well take a look.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.603
Chief, the other
jurors and the alternate

03:31.607 --> 03:33.253
are sequestered up
on the eighth floor.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.072
This is Bailiff Hoss.

03:35.085 --> 03:37.213
He was the first guy in the room
when the call button was pushed.

03:37.225 --> 03:38.783
- Bailiff...
- Ma'am.

03:38.797 --> 03:41.562
From what I understand, juror
number 9 was finishing her lunch,

03:41.686 --> 03:44.610
when suddenly she stood up,
grabbed her chest, and collapsed.

03:44.948 --> 03:46.381
Could be anything in that food.

03:46.406 --> 03:49.342
But all the other jurors are just fine,
and the food all came from the same place.

03:49.348 --> 03:52.382
For what it's worth, Chief, paramedics
say, "heart attack, heart attack,

03:53.218 --> 03:54.672
heart attack".

03:54.685 --> 03:56.721
Where'd I put my glasses ?

03:57.717 --> 03:59.920
Is this where juror
number 9 ate her lunch ?

03:59.947 --> 04:01.852
- Yes, ma'am.
- And this is her pocketbook ?

04:01.855 --> 04:03.292
Yeah, I believe so.

04:13.996 --> 04:15.442
Bela K. Rose.

04:15.447 --> 04:18.339
March 17, 1953.

04:25.508 --> 04:27.872
Looks like Bela took
all her medicine today.

04:36.417 --> 04:37.650
Mama...

04:38.675 --> 04:40.010
Chief...

04:40.256 --> 04:41.550
I'm  right about this.

04:41.608 --> 04:43.540
I swear, I'm right.

04:50.006 --> 04:51.383
You better be.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.483
Lieutenant Tao,
would you please find out

04:53.498 --> 04:55.561
what is in these pills, thank you.

04:55.856 --> 04:58.352
Lieutenant Provenza, would
you and lieutenant Flynn mind

04:58.357 --> 05:00.251
escortin' our juror here
to the morgue ?

05:00.285 --> 05:01.353
I'll drive.

05:01.365 --> 05:03.752
Detective Sanchez, let's
gather up all of this food,

05:03.755 --> 05:06.393
and have it taken down to the
lab and screened for toxins.

05:06.717 --> 05:09.471
Detective Daniels, let's get a
background check on everyone who worked

05:09.485 --> 05:11.770
at this deli where this
lunch order was from,

05:11.948 --> 05:13.040
thank you.

05:15.617 --> 05:17.331
Sergeant Gabriel,

05:18.627 --> 05:21.091
let's get in touch
with Bela Rose's family,

05:21.096 --> 05:23.950
but no one talks to them
until we find out how she died.

05:24.156 --> 05:25.962
Thank you, everyone, and,

05:26.787 --> 05:27.793
thank you...

05:27.948 --> 05:28.711
thank you.

05:30.435 --> 05:32.221
Hi, mama, I'm workin'.

05:33.126 --> 05:34.093
Workin'...

05:35.905 --> 05:36.991
Yes, of course.

05:38.028 --> 05:39.090
Great aunt

05:39.845 --> 05:42.173
Eueless, in a coma, right, yes.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.602
Say  that again ?

05:46.386 --> 05:47.503
She did what ?

05:48.778 --> 05:49.701
Oh, mama, I--

05:50.635 --> 05:52.972
I'm not sure I can make
it to a funeral tomorrow.

05:54.445 --> 05:55.601
Where are you ?

05:57.016 --> 05:58.303
D.F.W.?

05:59.016 --> 06:00.111
4 hours ?

06:00.155 --> 06:02.953
Your plane is going to be
in Los Angeles in 4 hours ?

06:14.977 --> 06:17.192
- Ma'am, you all right ?
- I'm fine, fine.

06:19.165 --> 06:21.481
So, I take it that you weren't here

06:21.496 --> 06:23.180
in the room when juror
number 9 collapsed ?

06:23.198 --> 06:25.663
No, ma'am, I was eating
my lunch outside the door.

06:25.727 --> 06:28.051
I heard the panic
button, I ran in, and I

06:28.078 --> 06:30.051
and I did C.P.R. until
the ambulance arrived.

06:30.218 --> 06:33.213
All right, then, I'm gonna need
to start interviewing these jurors.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.683
- If I can take them one at a time.
- No, that's not possible.

06:36.926 --> 06:39.440
Are you tellin' me I need to
interview them in a group ?

06:39.585 --> 06:41.303
No, not exactly.

06:42.347 --> 06:43.952
Well, how do I talk to them then ?

06:43.988 --> 06:45.021
You can't.

06:45.246 --> 06:46.310
I can't ?

06:46.348 --> 06:48.180
Every juror is completely off-limits

06:48.196 --> 06:49.980
until you conclude
your investigation.

06:50.007 --> 06:52.631
There  were 11 eye-witnesses
to that death, Will.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.561
There must be some way
I can interview them.

06:54.617 --> 06:56.401
There is, but not until
they deliver a verdict.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.793
- Which will be ?
- When you finish your investigation.

06:59.561 --> 07:01.137
Do you hear yourself ?

07:01.176 --> 07:02.420
This is impossible.

07:03.206 --> 07:05.038
There were threats
against that jury, Will.

07:05.048 --> 07:07.452
We're investigating that.
The jurors were informed,

07:07.767 --> 07:09.220
they mostly elected to stay.

07:09.308 --> 07:10.730
One of them died.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.112
What about a mistrial ?

07:14.138 --> 07:17.051
I could talk to the jurors if I
got a mistrial, how about that ?

07:17.057 --> 07:18.872
Yeah, the only way you're
gonna get a mistrial-- which

07:18.895 --> 07:20.613
the department does not want--

07:20.808 --> 07:23.012
is to establish a direct
causal link between Asourian

07:23.017 --> 07:25.140
and this particular dead juror.

07:25.808 --> 07:27.011
Ok, well,

07:27.936 --> 07:29.520
let's see what doctor
Crippen has to say.

07:29.567 --> 07:31.650
I can still talk to him, can't I ?

07:31.706 --> 07:33.153
Am I keeping you from something ?

07:33.156 --> 07:35.340
Oh, no, no, I'm just...

07:35.566 --> 07:38.320
pickin' my mother up at
the airport in 3 hours.

07:38.508 --> 07:40.191
From Atlanta via Dallas.

07:40.607 --> 07:43.592
Well, things must be going well if
you're introducing your family to Fritz.

07:46.478 --> 07:48.252
Well, I haven't finished unpacking,

07:48.267 --> 07:50.131
but I got everything
off the truck, why ?

07:50.198 --> 07:52.661
Well, uh, first I wanna say
how sorry

07:52.675 --> 07:54.551
I am about this mornin'.

07:54.576 --> 07:56.111
You know, movin' into a new place,

07:56.127 --> 07:58.332
that's one of the most
stressful things a person can do.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.030
What's the matter ?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.250
Nothin'.

08:03.907 --> 08:05.392
It's just that...

08:05.407 --> 08:08.573
well, I think you're right, and we
oughta be doin' this together, so...

08:08.737 --> 08:10.832
we might oughta wait
for you to move in--

08:11.726 --> 08:13.833
until I finish this investigation.

08:14.095 --> 08:15.870
Look, you're mad about this morning,

08:15.937 --> 08:16.820
No !

08:17.606 --> 08:18.952
No, no, no.

08:19.297 --> 08:20.813
It's just that...

08:21.227 --> 08:23.323
my great aunt died, and...

08:23.357 --> 08:25.173
Wait the one in a
coma in Santa Clarita ?

08:25.178 --> 08:25.833
Right.

08:26.588 --> 08:28.170
Your parents just called
about her last week.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.690
Yeah... and,

08:29.696 --> 08:31.200
as it turns out my...

08:31.227 --> 08:32.510
my mother

08:32.538 --> 08:35.142
is... comin'in for the funeral,

08:35.436 --> 08:36.270
and...

08:36.294 --> 08:38.541
<i>oh, I see... so what
you're really saying is</i>

08:38.885 --> 08:40.812
since your mother
would have a meltdown,

08:40.846 --> 08:42.991
if she finds out her adult daughter

08:43.017 --> 08:45.411
has a boyfriend, you
want me to move out.

08:45.845 --> 08:47.363
<i>Does she get to meet Kitty ?</i>

08:47.916 --> 08:49.713
Think she'll have a meltdown

08:49.726 --> 08:51.820
if she finds you living with a cat ?

08:51.908 --> 08:54.710
Fritz... I know I've
handled this all wrong

08:54.717 --> 08:57.530
and I apologize from
the bottom of my heart.

08:57.686 --> 08:59.682
But my mother won't be here long

08:59.697 --> 09:01.571
and then this jury case will close,

09:01.586 --> 09:04.081
and we can move in all
together like we wanted.

09:08.376 --> 09:09.353
Fritz...

09:10.928 --> 09:11.983
Fritz, are you there ?

09:11.995 --> 09:13.462
<i>Yeah, for about another hour.</i>

09:13.765 --> 09:16.082
I'm gonna move everything
back out right now, Brenda.

09:16.596 --> 09:18.692
And then, tomorrow night

09:19.177 --> 09:20.553
at 8:00,

09:21.075 --> 09:23.812
I'm gonna come by and pick you
and your mother up for dinner.

09:24.305 --> 09:25.172
Wait.

09:25.186 --> 09:26.432
<i>You introduce her to me,</i>

09:26.446 --> 09:28.353
<i>and you're gonna tell her
who I am,</i>

09:29.377 --> 09:30.413
<i>or else</i>

09:30.488 --> 09:31.552
we're done.

09:35.417 --> 09:37.723
Ace inhibitor, beta blocker,

09:37.755 --> 09:39.801
diuretic, and some vitamins.

09:39.816 --> 09:42.291
Your juror is being treated
for congestive heart failure.

09:42.868 --> 09:44.803
Not very successfully.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.182
Digoxin. Now, a normal dosage, say,

09:47.185 --> 09:50.260
between 0.8 to 2.0 milligrams
regulates the heartbeat.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.213
Any more than that is dangerous.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.163
So, I decided to do
a blood level check, and found

09:55.208 --> 09:58.171
that she'd taken 16 times
the recommended dosage,

09:58.416 --> 10:00.623
which turned her
medication into poison.

10:00.637 --> 10:03.690
- Or someone spiked her lunch.
- Wait a minute, lieutenant.

10:04.167 --> 10:05.873
Dr. Crippen, is it possible that

10:05.898 --> 10:08.463
the medication built up
in her system over time ?

10:08.585 --> 10:11.241
No, digoxin has a
very short half-life.

10:11.427 --> 10:13.351
For that much to still
have been found in her body,

10:13.355 --> 10:14.853
she would have had to
take them all at once.

10:14.856 --> 10:16.961
What about an accidental overdose ?

10:17.255 --> 10:19.590
I find it difficult to
believe that anybody could take

10:19.596 --> 10:21.522
16 pills by accident.

10:21.586 --> 10:23.182
So,  someone poisoned her.

10:23.406 --> 10:25.480
Or... she did it on purpose.

10:29.415 --> 10:32.003
Deputy chief Brenda
Leigh Johnson, L.A.P.D.

10:32.308 --> 10:34.183
Is this Bela Rose's home ?

10:42.875 --> 10:44.642
Justin, take Emily and go with Gram.

10:47.186 --> 10:49.642
So sorry to bother you, Dr. Rose,

10:49.646 --> 10:51.370
but your wife has
been serving on a jury,

10:51.387 --> 10:53.433
and I have a couple of
questions I need to ask you.

10:53.455 --> 10:55.270
Did she tell you
anything about the nature

10:55.277 --> 10:56.913
of the case in which she was involved ?

10:57.278 --> 10:58.862
Pardon us, Dr. Rose.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.963
Excuse me, Chief.
Can I speak to you ?

11:04.267 --> 11:07.100
If he says "yes, " Chief, that
could be grounds for a mistrial.

11:07.118 --> 11:09.722
Lieutenant, you need
to wait outside, please.

11:09.738 --> 11:10.632
Now.

11:10.688 --> 11:12.062
Get out !

11:12.238 --> 11:13.112
Thank you.

11:13.117 --> 11:15.341
Oh ! You want a
mistrial. I thought--

11:15.935 --> 11:16.963
Sorry.

11:17.798 --> 11:20.761
Did you know anything about the
case your wife was serving on ?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.612
I know there were threats
made against the jury.

11:23.686 --> 11:24.823
What's happened ?

11:25.388 --> 11:27.673
When did you last see
your wife, Dr. Rose ?

11:30.507 --> 11:32.501
This morning.
I had a delivery at 6:30.

11:32.515 --> 11:34.371
I slipped out while
she was still sleeping.

11:34.385 --> 11:36.631
Then I was at the hospital
like I am every day.

11:37.225 --> 11:38.182
You know...

11:39.398 --> 11:41.370
this is starting to scare me.
Where's my wife ?

11:42.608 --> 11:44.290
I'm  sorry, Dr. Rose,

11:44.308 --> 11:46.462
but during deliberations
this afternoon,

11:46.478 --> 11:48.102
your wife went into cardiac arrest

11:48.105 --> 11:49.923
and we were not able to save her.

11:56.157 --> 11:56.961
Why...

12:00.398 --> 12:01.711
why didn't you...

12:02.275 --> 12:03.743
tell me that when I first asked you ?

12:03.745 --> 12:06.043
I mean, that should have been
the first thing out of your mouth.

12:06.046 --> 12:08.730
What is the matter with you people ?!

12:08.778 --> 12:10.410
- The coroner found--
- Wait.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.601
My wife's already been to the coroner ?

12:14.036 --> 12:17.103
We weren't sure if she
died of natural causes.

12:21.067 --> 12:23.851
So, we wanted to find
out before talking to you.

12:24.456 --> 12:27.281
She had elevated levels
of digoxin in her system,

12:27.287 --> 12:29.583
and we were wondering if she might
have taken that by mistake or--

12:29.586 --> 12:30.732
- or...
- No !

12:31.316 --> 12:32.040
No...

12:34.258 --> 12:36.150
she's very organized about

12:36.415 --> 12:39.173
her medication. She puts it
all together for the week on...

12:40.335 --> 12:41.182
today.

12:42.156 --> 12:43.282
On mondays.

12:45.357 --> 12:48.233
Besides the fact that I'm a
doctor, and my mother was a nurse,

12:48.728 --> 12:50.750
why do you think I wouldn't
be able to help my wife with--

12:52.337 --> 12:53.683
with her own medication ?

12:53.727 --> 12:56.320
Had she been depressed
or anxious lately ?

12:57.636 --> 12:58.623
David.

12:59.977 --> 13:01.651
I am so sorry.

13:03.205 --> 13:03.841
But

13:04.418 --> 13:06.442
you need to help these people.

13:07.116 --> 13:09.801
They're trying to figure
out if Bela killed herself.

13:11.397 --> 13:12.981
No, she didn't kill herself.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.590
You did.

13:17.578 --> 13:18.772
You people.

13:19.388 --> 13:21.232
Somebody threatened that jury.

13:23.215 --> 13:25.763
A guy called the courthouse
and said he would kill

13:25.866 --> 13:27.361
anyone who voted to convict,

13:27.387 --> 13:28.993
and have you found him yet ?

13:29.285 --> 13:30.093
Have you ?!

13:30.146 --> 13:32.582
Sir, that's an on-going investigation.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.591
Yes, well.

13:33.905 --> 13:36.481
Your on-going investigation
murdered my wife.

13:54.116 --> 13:55.322
Is this it ?

13:55.495 --> 13:56.722
This is it.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.632
What is that moving truck
doing in front of your house ?

14:02.426 --> 14:04.100
New neighbors, I guess.

14:04.128 --> 14:05.702
Well, I call that tacky.

14:05.707 --> 14:07.673
Now, mama, I want you to wait here.

14:07.676 --> 14:10.101
I'm gonna go inside, turn
on all the lights for you

14:10.115 --> 14:12.493
and then I'm gonna come back
and help you with your bags.

14:20.295 --> 14:21.282
Fritz ?

14:32.215 --> 14:33.602
Fritz ?

14:38.887 --> 14:40.600
Now, don't worry so much

14:40.617 --> 14:42.353
about me, Brenda Leigh.

14:42.375 --> 14:45.263
I can carry a bag.
Well, thank you.

14:45.278 --> 14:47.010
Thank you so much.

14:47.078 --> 14:49.460
Well, this is so

14:49.796 --> 14:50.922
cozy.

14:54.157 --> 14:55.262
Is that...

14:56.218 --> 14:57.552
is that art ?

14:59.887 --> 15:02.170
I bought the place furnished
and the woman who lived here

15:02.176 --> 15:04.741
before me, she loved
baseball... players.

15:06.017 --> 15:08.211
She dated baseball players.

15:08.857 --> 15:09.880
All right.

15:10.687 --> 15:12.723
Now, where do you want me to be ?

15:12.738 --> 15:15.653
And don't go to any trouble.
I can sleep on that sofa there.

15:15.668 --> 15:16.812
Oh, mama. Don't be silly.

15:16.827 --> 15:18.931
My bed's big enough for both of us.

15:36.995 --> 15:39.043
Your father and your brother
are gonna love

15:39.055 --> 15:41.203
seeing your house, I know.

15:41.747 --> 15:44.433
Oh, that's an unusual
arrangement, Brenda.

15:44.558 --> 15:46.931
All your clothes are on
one side of the closet ?

15:47.457 --> 15:49.461
And half your shelves are empty.

15:51.838 --> 15:53.213
I made room for you.

15:53.255 --> 15:55.051
I thought you'd said
you didn't have time

15:55.067 --> 15:57.113
to come home before
you picked me up.

15:57.156 --> 16:00.332
Well, I--I didn't. It's just
that I keep space available

16:00.336 --> 16:02.393
in case anyone decides
to come visit. Oh, mama,

16:02.898 --> 16:04.741
I'm so happy to see you.

16:05.615 --> 16:06.972
What time's the funeral ?

16:07.058 --> 16:08.080
2:30.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.650
Would it be easier to
leave from your office ?

16:10.667 --> 16:12.650
I'd love to meet the
people you work with.

16:12.665 --> 16:14.771
Oh, no. No.

16:14.855 --> 16:15.990
No, no, no.

16:16.056 --> 16:16.613
No.

16:17.468 --> 16:20.260
I think that you should stay
here and I'll pick you up.

16:21.306 --> 16:22.073
Well,

16:22.118 --> 16:25.041
I guess that will give me a
chance to measure your windows.

16:25.695 --> 16:27.601
I knew you wouldn't
have proper curtains,

16:27.616 --> 16:29.521
so, I brought some swatches.

16:29.547 --> 16:32.023
Do you remember the drapes you had

16:32.065 --> 16:33.940
in your room before
you left for college ?

16:33.956 --> 16:36.832
Can you believe I still
have that material ?

16:45.156 --> 16:46.672
My mother, Mrs. Johnson,

16:46.675 --> 16:48.541
will be observing today.

16:49.096 --> 16:51.133
Y'all just ignore me.

16:51.606 --> 16:53.410
But I did bring some

16:53.457 --> 16:56.161
homemade fudge
if anybody wants any.

16:57.657 --> 17:00.332
That's so very nice
of you, Mrs. Johnson.

17:00.348 --> 17:02.242
Well, you are so welcome.

17:02.816 --> 17:03.522
Now,

17:03.716 --> 17:05.643
everybody smile !

17:07.876 --> 17:09.109
Thank you.

17:09.855 --> 17:11.132
All right, then.

17:12.405 --> 17:14.162
Since the jury is off-limits

17:14.178 --> 17:16.803
for the time being, unless we get a
mistrial, I thought it might be helpful

17:16.818 --> 17:19.440
to review the case they've been
hearing, which was lieutenant Flynn's.

17:21.255 --> 17:22.490
So I can talk again ?

17:22.516 --> 17:23.162
Y es.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.731
4 years ago, for reasons

17:29.758 --> 17:31.742
we haven't been able to establish,

17:31.807 --> 17:33.422
Aram Asourian

17:33.806 --> 17:35.812
drove his son Vahan

17:36.218 --> 17:37.621
to a Glendale nightclub.

17:38.088 --> 17:39.963
While Aram waited in the car,

17:39.988 --> 17:41.992
Vahan, a genuine psycho,

17:42.666 --> 17:44.583
nailed shut the nightclub doors,

17:44.618 --> 17:46.753
spread gasoline all over the place,

17:47.865 --> 17:49.353
and then set it on fire.

17:49.398 --> 17:51.081
Now, we believe they
were after the owner,

17:51.098 --> 17:52.810
whose car was in the parking lot,

17:52.868 --> 17:53.762
but instead,

17:54.146 --> 17:56.140
2 teenage korean girls

17:56.707 --> 17:58.440
who were cleaning up inside

17:58.745 --> 18:00.290
got burned to death.

18:03.887 --> 18:04.492
Now,

18:04.908 --> 18:07.370
we ID'ed Aram, the
father, at the scene,

18:07.375 --> 18:08.592
but our eyewitness

18:08.618 --> 18:11.003
got his head blown off
before he could testify.

18:12.765 --> 18:14.230
Why didn't you go after the son ?

18:14.258 --> 18:15.570
We couldn't find him.

18:15.598 --> 18:17.052
The armenian mob is big

18:17.067 --> 18:19.400
into identity theft
and waste management--

18:19.625 --> 18:21.731
ideal for hiding a scum
like Vahan.

18:22.355 --> 18:24.170
Now, we thought by
prosecuting the father,

18:24.177 --> 18:25.611
we could smoke the son out.

18:25.837 --> 18:26.791
No luck.

18:31.396 --> 18:33.713
Let's say Vahan came back

18:33.725 --> 18:35.400
from wherever

18:35.576 --> 18:38.170
to shoot the eyewitness
in the first trial.

18:38.466 --> 18:40.162
And his father... or

18:40.508 --> 18:41.912
his father's attorney...

18:41.957 --> 18:43.861
told Vahan Bela Rose
had a heart condition ?

18:43.876 --> 18:44.320
Look,

18:45.205 --> 18:47.783
Vahan would have known that an
overdose would have killed her

18:48.345 --> 18:50.350
because he was studying
to be a pharmacist.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.163
Would he have access to the drug ?

18:52.208 --> 18:53.662
Oh, excuse me.

18:53.735 --> 18:56.911
The juror's... husband is a...

18:57.307 --> 18:59.221
drumroll... doctor.

18:59.815 --> 19:00.803
Thank you.

19:01.828 --> 19:04.192
But anybody can get
their hands on digoxin.

19:04.496 --> 19:05.980
You can find it online,

19:06.198 --> 19:07.592
health food stores.

19:07.637 --> 19:10.662
It's basically a refined
version of an herb...

19:10.967 --> 19:11.892
foxglove.

19:12.045 --> 19:13.802
Maybe somebody
mixed it into her food.

19:14.405 --> 19:16.211
I'm sorry to bother y'all,

19:16.226 --> 19:18.863
but I can't seem to
find the ladies'room.

19:19.026 --> 19:20.262
Oh, well,

19:20.396 --> 19:23.300
please. Please.

19:24.778 --> 19:27.103
- Allow me.
- Why, thank you.

19:27.117 --> 19:29.223
Well... lieutenant Provenza.

19:29.225 --> 19:30.623
It's my honor, ma'am.

19:31.416 --> 19:33.901
- A lieutenant. Well !
- Well.

19:37.587 --> 19:39.810
Back to Aram's son, Vahan.

19:39.896 --> 19:42.883
Considering all the people dropping
dead around his father's trial,

19:43.258 --> 19:45.422
he can't be that far away.
Why can't we find him ?

19:45.816 --> 19:48.110
I just got Vahan's warrant package

19:48.116 --> 19:49.413
from the fugitive squad.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.213
The last time they
looked for this dummy

19:51.225 --> 19:52.780
was nearly a year ago.

19:52.927 --> 19:54.631
If I can find this boy,

19:54.697 --> 19:56.692
it would be an automatic
mistrial, wouldn't it ?

19:57.907 --> 19:59.131
Lieutenant Tao,

19:59.185 --> 20:02.031
please get me warrants to
tap all of Asourian's phones.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.112
Sergeant Gabriel, if you could arrange
surveillance outside every house

20:05.126 --> 20:07.370
connected with that family, thank you.

20:07.395 --> 20:08.061
And

20:08.486 --> 20:11.482
detective Daniels, please drag
every credit card they have,

20:11.578 --> 20:13.300
every bank account.

20:14.075 --> 20:16.023
Lieutenant Flynn,
maybe you could tell me,

20:16.278 --> 20:19.270
who else besides you was
watching this trial every day ?

20:20.346 --> 20:21.882
Doctor Grant, I'm just...

20:21.926 --> 20:23.730
I'm so impressed
with your credentials.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.261
Call me Alison, chief Johnson.

20:25.347 --> 20:27.400
Oh, you can call me Brenda.

20:27.846 --> 20:29.582
Anyway. You're, like,

20:30.295 --> 20:31.403
part detective,

20:31.416 --> 20:33.792
part social worker, part-shrink.

20:34.406 --> 20:36.262
Being a jury consultant, I mean.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.432
That's a fairly accurate description,

20:39.007 --> 20:41.493
though I think of myself more
as a trial strategist, since

20:41.515 --> 20:43.533
I also help craft arguments

20:43.536 --> 20:45.711
I think will sway
individual jury members.

20:46.697 --> 20:48.382
So if I asked you questions

20:48.398 --> 20:50.163
about their personalities or whatever,

20:50.168 --> 20:51.732
you could just pop up
with an answer ?

20:51.748 --> 20:53.000
Oh, yes, oftentimes.

20:53.015 --> 20:55.972
Li--like juror number 9 usually had

20:55.976 --> 20:58.912
lunch with juror number--

20:58.918 --> 21:00.520
- juror number 3.
- Right.

21:00.538 --> 21:02.842
Partly because they each
had health issues

21:02.987 --> 21:04.181
and teenage sons.

21:04.217 --> 21:06.273
How do you diagnose health issues ?

21:06.307 --> 21:08.121
This is so fascinating.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.400
Well, that's very simple.

21:09.448 --> 21:12.090
They both declared their illnesses
during jury selection.

21:12.348 --> 21:14.360
Juror number 9, as you know, had

21:14.385 --> 21:16.143
congestive heart disease.

21:16.167 --> 21:17.771
And juror number 3 is a diabetic.

21:17.865 --> 21:18.853
I see.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.613
And why did you think
Bela belonged on your jury ?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.183
Well, now we're straying into
information that's confidential.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.003
Oh, you know what ? It's not !

21:26.135 --> 21:28.641
You can answer it freely. No worries.

21:29.237 --> 21:30.483
No, Brenda,

21:30.885 --> 21:32.493
it's off-limits professionally.
I mean,

21:32.506 --> 21:35.493
the information you're requesting
is the property of my client.

21:35.537 --> 21:37.681
Now, doctor Grant--
Alison,

21:37.988 --> 21:39.020
I mean.

21:39.295 --> 21:41.991
I want you to know you're not
required to answer these questions,

21:42.005 --> 21:44.783
but if you don't, I'm going to get
search warrants for your house,

21:44.818 --> 21:46.251
phone, and office, and find out

21:46.267 --> 21:48.282
just how seriously
you've been studying this jury.

21:48.295 --> 21:49.763
Search warrants ?

21:50.195 --> 21:53.062
- On what grounds ?
- On the grounds that lieutenant Flynn here

21:53.076 --> 21:54.852
says this particular strategy of yours

21:54.866 --> 21:56.172
wasn't working out so well.

21:56.188 --> 21:58.102
Asourian was about to get life.

21:58.105 --> 22:00.513
Which would affect your
bonus, if I'm not mistaken.

22:01.147 --> 22:02.763
Bonuses must be nice.

22:02.858 --> 22:04.630
I wish I got bonuses.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.260
What was yours supposed to be ?

22:06.767 --> 22:08.553
And Asourian's attorney,

22:08.947 --> 22:10.072
Mr. Milbrook,

22:10.116 --> 22:11.851
he just hates to lose,
doesn't he ?

22:12.036 --> 22:14.030
And you depend on lawyers
for your income, yes ?

22:14.047 --> 22:15.640
Mr. Asourian would have been found

22:15.658 --> 22:17.633
not guilty, and I'm certain of it.

22:17.646 --> 22:19.490
That's a load of crap
and you know it.

22:19.507 --> 22:21.681
You see, Alison,
I do something a little bit

22:21.687 --> 22:24.583
like jury selection myself,
only I choose suspects.

22:24.585 --> 22:27.331
And I base my choices on people
who have financial

22:27.347 --> 22:30.113
or professional connections
with a victim they knew really,

22:30.198 --> 22:31.720
really well.

22:31.865 --> 22:33.531
Like you knew Bela Rose,

22:33.715 --> 22:35.581
A.K.A. juror number 9.

22:35.635 --> 22:37.531
So, I'm going to ask you
a few questions.

22:37.538 --> 22:40.073
And you're going to answer them,
or I'm going to make your life a living hell

22:40.076 --> 22:41.672
for days on end.

22:41.856 --> 22:44.463
Why did you choose Bela Rose
for this jury ?

22:47.185 --> 22:49.083
Her maiden name was armenian.

22:49.547 --> 22:51.892
Armenians are a very tight-knit,
family culture,

22:51.895 --> 22:53.691
and they seldom hurt their own.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.343
And I thought she would be
sympathetic

22:55.358 --> 22:57.282
to a father standing up for his son.

22:57.758 --> 22:59.512
That's very smart of you.

23:00.506 --> 23:02.862
Speaking of the son, where is he ?
Who would know ?

23:03.037 --> 23:04.183
And before you answer,

23:04.227 --> 23:06.561
remember : hell, hell, hell. I mean it.

23:08.088 --> 23:09.310
I'm not sure.

23:09.325 --> 23:11.563
But Mr. Milbrook gets phone calls

23:11.567 --> 23:13.342
asking how the trial went
from someone

23:13.357 --> 23:15.101
he never mentions by name.

23:15.238 --> 23:16.390
Every day.

23:20.968 --> 23:22.263
There you are.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.843
There you are, Brenda.

23:23.868 --> 23:25.721
The fudge went over big.

23:25.736 --> 23:27.750
I hope you got some
before it ran out.

23:27.808 --> 23:29.392
I'm not eating sugar right now.

23:29.406 --> 23:31.132
Don't lie to your mama.

23:31.395 --> 23:34.001
I'll make some more tonight
when we come home.

23:34.078 --> 23:35.082
Are you ready to go ?

23:35.138 --> 23:36.550
Mama, I'm so sorry,

23:36.566 --> 23:39.160
but I'm not gonna be able to take you
to this funeral after all.

23:39.557 --> 23:41.022
- What ?
- I wish I could,

23:41.045 --> 23:43.320
but I have this murder
I have to investigate.

23:43.346 --> 23:46.283
Oh, for heaven's sake. There are
murders every day of the week.

23:46.858 --> 23:49.690
And your aunt Floetta
will only have one funeral.

23:49.997 --> 23:52.122
How am I supposed to get there, even ?

23:52.148 --> 23:54.303
Oh, well, I could take you, ma'am.

23:57.347 --> 23:59.551
Could you just wait one second, please ?
Mama,

23:59.565 --> 24:01.801
would you come over
here just for a second ? Ok ?

24:01.846 --> 24:03.582
Thank you. Have a seat.

24:04.617 --> 24:05.573
Thanks.

24:07.468 --> 24:08.762
What are you doing ?

24:09.228 --> 24:10.712
- Being nice ?
- You're not nice.

24:10.726 --> 24:11.861
And you're on duty.

24:11.888 --> 24:13.193
Well, give me the afternoon off.

24:13.215 --> 24:15.253
My mother is married.
To my father.

24:15.885 --> 24:18.692
Relax, deputy chief Brenda Leigh.

24:18.738 --> 24:20.680
I don't date women over 35.

24:21.967 --> 24:24.060
40 if I'm drinking.

24:25.425 --> 24:27.951
All right, then. You can have her
back by 7 :00,

24:27.967 --> 24:30.051
'cause I have a dinner i cannot miss.

24:34.495 --> 24:36.821
Mr. Milbrook, thank you so much
for stopping by.

24:36.845 --> 24:39.213
How goes your motion for a mistrial ?

24:39.308 --> 24:40.242
It doesn't.

24:41.028 --> 24:43.912
I expected better of you.
All right, then.

24:44.208 --> 24:47.123
I have been reviewing the
transcripts of this trial,

24:47.136 --> 24:49.100
and in presenting
your client's defense,

24:49.136 --> 24:51.322
you've never once brought up
his son, Vahan.

24:51.575 --> 24:53.680
And it looks like he's the one
who set the fire.

24:53.715 --> 24:55.513
Asourian won't let me mention the boy.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.671
And Vahan's vanished.
Nobody's seen him in years.

24:59.366 --> 25:01.621
I keep wondering how wonderful

25:01.686 --> 25:04.330
it would be if Vahan were suddenly
just to turn up.

25:04.765 --> 25:05.892
You'd get your mistrial

25:05.908 --> 25:08.420
and preserve your sterling reputation.
More billable hours.

25:08.445 --> 25:10.173
All sorts of good things
could happen.

25:10.248 --> 25:11.600
Yeah, I know.

25:11.618 --> 25:14.470
Asourian won't let me mention the boy,
though. He's quite serious about that.

25:15.715 --> 25:16.901
Yeah, well,

25:16.926 --> 25:18.862
maybe we'll get lucky
and someone'll just

25:18.885 --> 25:21.843
turn up with an untraceable tip
that will lead us to Vahan.

25:23.557 --> 25:25.231
And this can end.

25:27.825 --> 25:29.053
How untraceable ?

25:29.137 --> 25:31.660
They'll find weapons of mass
destruction in baghdad first.

25:32.368 --> 25:35.110
Because the LAPD brass doesn't want
a mistrial, either,

25:35.135 --> 25:36.702
and I've been so warned.

25:39.715 --> 25:41.791
Well, gosh.

25:42.867 --> 25:45.462
I certainly wouldn't want to get you
into any kind of trouble.

25:49.518 --> 25:50.521
<i>Hello ?</i>

25:52.838 --> 25:54.053
<i>Hello ?</i>

25:58.158 --> 26:00.730
Let me think how I can help you.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.933
would you excuse me ? Something
at lunch didn't agree with me.

26:09.617 --> 26:10.682
I'll be right back.

26:30.638 --> 26:33.533
<i>Hello ? Hello ?
You there,</i>

26:33.947 --> 26:35.071
<i>Jamie ?</i>

26:35.226 --> 26:37.043
<i>Do you have a message
from my father ?</i>

26:38.045 --> 26:40.313
Could you get me an address
that goes with that number ?

26:41.195 --> 26:42.801
Chief, if Aram Asourian

26:42.817 --> 26:44.533
walks out of court tomorrow
a free man--

26:44.567 --> 26:46.513
that's not my case, sergeant Gabriel.

26:46.526 --> 26:47.900
It's just not my case.

27:07.605 --> 27:08.831
Will you stop ?

27:09.216 --> 27:10.072
Sorry.

27:13.787 --> 27:15.082
Is it apartment 3 ?

27:15.167 --> 27:17.073
<i>Negative. It's apartment 1-A.</i>

27:17.168 --> 27:18.403
"A" as in alpha.

27:18.557 --> 27:19.333
1-A.

27:19.348 --> 27:20.661
<i>Everyone got that ?</i>

27:21.025 --> 27:23.432
He's been in there all day.

27:23.716 --> 27:26.030
If you had his girlfriend,
you'd be in there all day, too.

27:36.435 --> 27:38.353
Vahan is not inside.

27:39.336 --> 27:40.641
<i>He's on foot.</i>

27:41.716 --> 27:43.420
Heading towards the apartment.

27:53.445 --> 27:55.510
In pursuit, heading north
on the alley.

28:04.268 --> 28:06.650
Don't make me run, you bastard !

28:18.605 --> 28:21.042
Officer needs help. We have shots fired
at our location.

28:21.045 --> 28:23.261
Send an ambulance.
Get down !

28:26.118 --> 28:28.540
Wait ! Wait ! Where are you ?

28:28.685 --> 28:29.571
Over here.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.822
- Are you hit ?
- Shut up, you moron.

28:34.826 --> 28:36.152
No, I'm fine.

28:38.528 --> 28:40.552
All right, I'm going to have
to ask you to step back.

28:40.905 --> 28:43.341
Do me a favor. Get my
vest out of the car.

28:43.866 --> 28:46.033
I don't want to get into a beef
about not following protocol.

28:53.486 --> 28:55.630
If you could give us a moment, please ?
Thank you.

28:58.447 --> 28:59.442
Vahan ?

29:00.057 --> 29:03.043
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh
Johnson of the LAPD.

29:03.568 --> 29:06.173
Under the circumstances,
I've called for a priest.

29:06.698 --> 29:09.273
But I need to record your
statement before I let him in.

29:09.866 --> 29:11.341
Do you understand what I'm saying ?

29:12.996 --> 29:15.290
Since he's not going
to be here much longer,

29:15.357 --> 29:17.153
do you think we need
to read him his rights ?

29:17.187 --> 29:19.333
Well, it's better to be
safe than sorry, yeah.

29:20.495 --> 29:23.440
Today is tuesday, june 20,

29:23.497 --> 29:26.262
2006. 4 :12 in the afternoon.

29:26.835 --> 29:29.151
I'm in Glendale Memorial Hospital
with Vahan

29:29.468 --> 29:31.123
Nazim Asourian.

29:31.248 --> 29:33.490
Sergeant David Gabriel is also present.

29:33.976 --> 29:35.500
Vahan, you have the right
to remain silent.

29:35.516 --> 29:38.470
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

29:38.795 --> 29:41.491
You have the right to a lawyer.
Do you understand what I'm saying ?

29:42.575 --> 29:44.910
- Try and speak if you can.
- Yes, I understand.

29:45.878 --> 29:47.902
Hey, stay calm, man.

29:48.285 --> 29:49.541
Stay calm.

29:50.036 --> 29:51.020
Now, Vahan,

29:51.636 --> 29:53.872
I am so, so sorry about

29:53.917 --> 29:55.691
how this has ended up for you,

29:56.467 --> 29:57.971
but before we part,

29:58.945 --> 30:00.403
you have an opportunity

30:00.415 --> 30:02.291
very few people ever have.

30:03.267 --> 30:04.713
You can save someone's life...

30:05.135 --> 30:06.370
your father's.

30:07.638 --> 30:09.430
You know what i'm
talking about, don't you ?

30:11.516 --> 30:13.393
Now, what about the nightclub fire ?

30:14.346 --> 30:16.160
Did your father start that, or did you ?

30:20.885 --> 30:22.761
I tip the owner of the club

30:23.676 --> 30:25.113
200 dollars.

30:26.228 --> 30:28.081
He still won't let me inside.

30:29.925 --> 30:31.723
He disrespected me.

30:32.848 --> 30:34.161
Called me a name.

30:34.695 --> 30:36.500
What did you do to the nightclub ?

30:41.355 --> 30:42.700
I burn it down.

30:43.755 --> 30:45.690
I saw the owner's car in the lot.

30:46.695 --> 30:48.261
I thought he was inside.

30:49.427 --> 30:51.243
It was just girls cleaning.

30:52.478 --> 30:53.940
I didn't know that.

30:54.868 --> 30:55.822
I didn't know.

30:58.367 --> 31:01.200
Then my father put me
on a plane to New Jersey

31:02.055 --> 31:03.660
and go on trial for me.

31:05.446 --> 31:06.830
My father is a good man.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.471
A great man.

31:09.507 --> 31:11.493
So you tried to keep your father
out of jail

31:12.106 --> 31:13.892
by killing the witness in the first trial.

31:14.576 --> 31:15.900
I come back to L.A.

31:17.477 --> 31:20.183
and I shoot the man
who saw my father.

31:21.195 --> 31:23.111
And in the second trial,
did you

31:23.436 --> 31:24.823
poison Bela Rose ?

31:25.358 --> 31:27.470
I made some phone calls
to the courthouse.

31:28.077 --> 31:30.293
I planned to kill juror number 4.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.372
But the other lady die first.

31:36.818 --> 31:39.771
And we end the interview
to accommodate Vahan's surgery.

31:42.536 --> 31:44.770
- What are you doing ?
- We're going to take you for an operation

31:44.786 --> 31:47.390
- so you can get better.
- But... but...

31:47.977 --> 31:49.163
you said I'm dying.

31:49.176 --> 31:51.750
Oh, no. I was very careful
not to say that, Vahan.

31:53.956 --> 31:56.030
You get well soon now, you hear ?

32:08.066 --> 32:10.852
Congratulations, Chief.
You got your mistrial.

32:10.868 --> 32:12.900
It's not my mistrial. It's my arrest.

32:13.377 --> 32:16.353
You'd think people'd be happy to
put a genuine killer behind bars.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.672
Aram Asourian is the leader
of a mob family.

32:19.915 --> 32:22.102
Yeah, well, maybe next time
you can pair him up

32:22.115 --> 32:23.862
with a crime he's actually committed.

32:24.178 --> 32:26.493
Personally, I always feel better
about the justice system

32:26.505 --> 32:29.281
when it matches up murder charges
with the right person.

32:29.677 --> 32:31.611
Then it's too bad Vahan didn't confess

32:31.626 --> 32:32.983
to killing the juror, too.

32:33.028 --> 32:34.703
Well, maybe he didn't.

32:34.728 --> 32:36.642
But Bela Rose didn't die
a natural death.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.672
And thanks to lieutenant Flynn's
determination--

32:38.676 --> 32:41.613
which I know you and the LAPD
are desperate to acknowledge--

32:41.757 --> 32:44.321
I now can talk to the jurors
who actually saw her die.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.493
- Commander.
- Sergeant.

32:55.196 --> 32:58.082
So, the jury consultant for the defense

32:58.087 --> 33:00.201
told us that you were good friends
with Bela.

33:00.225 --> 33:01.133
Yeah,

33:01.256 --> 33:02.822
we gossiped a lot.

33:03.678 --> 33:06.492
My son's going to college next year,
too, and,

33:06.745 --> 33:09.483
- she had her...her heart problem.
- Thank you.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.280
So, if we told you that
Bela took 16 pills

33:15.306 --> 33:16.713
all at once on purpose

33:16.746 --> 33:17.823
you'd be surprised ?

33:17.885 --> 33:18.881
Very.

33:19.447 --> 33:21.763
Look, people who are going to
kill themselves

33:21.766 --> 33:24.582
don't exercise and eat healthy and

33:24.638 --> 33:25.822
plan trips.

33:26.906 --> 33:27.770
So,

33:27.907 --> 33:30.323
yesterday in the jury room

33:30.397 --> 33:32.483
you saw her take her medication ?

33:33.627 --> 33:35.523
Her vitamins at lunch.

33:35.968 --> 33:38.401
Just 2 capsule though, not 16 pills.

33:38.896 --> 33:40.951
And I'm sitting next to her
the whole time

33:41.417 --> 33:42.643
when she stood up

33:43.156 --> 33:44.650
and screamed.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.492
Did she say anything else

33:49.586 --> 33:51.961
about anyone else in her family

33:52.417 --> 33:53.552
other than her son ?

33:53.625 --> 33:55.183
She worried about money.

33:55.697 --> 33:58.102
Between sending Justin
to college and

33:59.955 --> 34:02.460
the assisted living center
for her mother-in-law

34:02.715 --> 34:05.653
Bela said they were looking at
an additional 40 grand a year.

34:05.998 --> 34:07.540
She wanted a smaller house

34:07.546 --> 34:09.502
cut back on expenses

34:09.536 --> 34:11.672
lower the stress on her heart.

34:12.554 --> 34:15.020
They weren't in complete agreement
about all that.

34:15.308 --> 34:17.409
She told you about these arguments ?

34:17.507 --> 34:18.802
No, but

34:19.327 --> 34:21.453
I couldn't help but overhear her

34:21.795 --> 34:23.969
once or twice Bela on her cell phone.

34:24.326 --> 34:26.210
During lunch she'd call home and

34:26.516 --> 34:28.681
things would start out
all considerate

34:29.275 --> 34:31.081
and then they'd get really intense.

34:32.385 --> 34:33.871
It's interesting, isn't it ?

34:34.268 --> 34:37.233
With all we have to spend on sending
our kids to college

34:37.248 --> 34:39.710
and... taking care of our parents

34:39.726 --> 34:41.889
even doctors have to cut back.

34:49.085 --> 34:50.120
Hey, chief.

34:50.225 --> 34:52.442
So I served the search warrant
at the Roses'house.

34:52.536 --> 34:55.330
And we got the doctor in an interview room
and he's hopping mad.

34:55.556 --> 34:58.302
He's making all kinds of noise
about suing us and stuff.

34:58.315 --> 34:59.780
Yeah, well, he'll get over that.

34:59.807 --> 35:02.503
- Did you get his wife's prescriptions ?
- Yeah. Tao's sorting through them

35:02.535 --> 35:03.201
Good.

35:03.207 --> 35:05.683
She had 3 months'worth
of drugs delivered at once.

35:05.708 --> 35:07.292
- Paid one deductible.
- Chief

35:07.306 --> 35:08.052
Yes ?

35:08.067 --> 35:10.991
I set your mother up so she could
watch tv until you're finished

35:11.028 --> 35:13.352
but if I were you I'd leave her alone
for a bit.

35:13.368 --> 35:15.813
She's not in the best
of moods right now.

35:16.367 --> 35:18.032
Detective Sanchez thank you.

35:18.805 --> 35:20.881
Oh, I brought this back
from the funeral for you

35:21.018 --> 35:22.513
since you're off sweets.

35:22.898 --> 35:24.533
It's a cake-like object

35:24.536 --> 35:25.701
made with some sort of

35:25.886 --> 35:28.222
prune crap substitute for sugar.

35:42.058 --> 35:44.082
There's no substitute for sugar.

36:02.417 --> 36:04.563
Hi, Chief ! What can I do for you ?

36:04.806 --> 36:07.703
How dare you bring my family
down here ?

36:09.075 --> 36:11.241
Read me my rights
I refuse to talk to you.

36:12.456 --> 36:13.470
All right, then.

36:13.496 --> 36:15.722
I'll get what I need
to know from your mom.

36:15.815 --> 36:17.391
You stay away from my mother !

36:17.408 --> 36:18.641
Why is that, doctor ?

36:19.325 --> 36:21.313
What does she know that you
don't want her telling me ?

36:21.588 --> 36:24.003
Think it'll just pop out of her mouth
as soon as I read her her rights ?

36:24.015 --> 36:26.473
- I want a lawyer.
- Well, why don't you just take a seat ?

36:30.546 --> 36:32.662
Since you've invoked
your right to counsel

36:33.098 --> 36:35.830
you leave me no choice, Dr. Rose.
It's nothing personal.

36:35.848 --> 36:38.040
I just have a dinner tonight
that I cannot miss.

36:48.036 --> 36:49.773
That's David's schedule

36:49.826 --> 36:51.632
You can see how busy he is

36:57.088 --> 36:58.522
Thank you

36:59.576 --> 37:01.202
I don't mind your having it

37:01.877 --> 37:04.151
but don't ask me to betray my son

37:04.928 --> 37:07.062
You're sure this isn't
against the law ?

37:07.485 --> 37:08.902
My watching ?

37:09.818 --> 37:11.551
In this little part of the world

37:11.986 --> 37:13.362
I am the law.

37:15.788 --> 37:18.723
Though we probably shouldn't
mention this to Brenda Leigh.

37:19.156 --> 37:20.610
I won't say a word.

37:21.797 --> 37:24.093
So, why don't you tell me

37:24.567 --> 37:26.161
how long have you lived
with them ?

37:27.135 --> 37:29.232
Since Bela returned to teaching.

37:29.847 --> 37:31.452
She needed me to

37:32.006 --> 37:34.280
care for the children
in the afternoon and

37:34.725 --> 37:36.671
baby-sit if they went out

37:36.905 --> 37:37.801
make dinner

37:38.358 --> 37:41.213
though I... I don't do much cooking
anymore

37:41.628 --> 37:44.322
I broke an expensive platter
last christmas

37:46.185 --> 37:47.180
So,

37:47.605 --> 37:50.441
Justin's off to college Emily's 12

37:50.865 --> 37:53.692
And Bela found me this wonderful

37:53.727 --> 37:56.342
retirement center.
Lakeview terrace

37:56.926 --> 37:58.840
I'll have my own little studio.

37:59.798 --> 38:02.772
Just have to wait for someone to die
then I move in.

38:04.075 --> 38:05.121
Sounds depressing.

38:05.537 --> 38:07.633
Well, I'm old, now.

38:08.297 --> 38:10.723
I break... things, I'm

38:11.248 --> 38:12.300
useless.

38:13.397 --> 38:14.842
or put another way

38:15.536 --> 38:17.040
you took care of your grandchildren

38:17.516 --> 38:19.852
you worked for your son and
daughter-in-law as a maid

38:20.046 --> 38:21.961
and when you outlived
your physical ability

38:21.965 --> 38:24.203
they decided to put you
someplace people go to die

38:25.378 --> 38:28.230
Too bad they couldn't just drop you off
on an ice floe somewhere

38:28.457 --> 38:30.781
Oh ! It wasn't like that

38:30.827 --> 38:32.611
My son loves me

38:32.677 --> 38:35.853
And it's a very, very nice
place, lakeview terrace.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.542
They have a dining room

38:39.058 --> 38:42.612
nursing. It's assisted
living, they call it.

38:42.705 --> 38:43.723
Sounds cheery.

38:45.015 --> 38:47.152
Let's talk about Bela
for a minute now

38:47.498 --> 38:50.122
because we're pretty sure
that she didn't kill herself

38:50.376 --> 38:52.961
and there was nothing
out of the way in her food

38:52.985 --> 38:55.273
So I keep wondering where

38:55.697 --> 38:57.993
that extra digoxin came from

38:59.007 --> 39:02.151
Now, Bela got her
prescription in 3 month lots

39:03.048 --> 39:05.123
And you know what's interesting ?
I've worked it out.

39:05.415 --> 39:08.153
There were 16 pills missing
from her last delivery

39:08.168 --> 39:10.093
which just happens to coincide

39:10.168 --> 39:11.751
with the dose that killed her.

39:13.898 --> 39:16.450
But Bela didn't take 16 pills
at lunch

39:16.756 --> 39:18.952
when she was poisoned.
She only took these

39:19.417 --> 39:20.590
her vitamins

39:22.037 --> 39:23.971
We know from her cell phone records

39:24.525 --> 39:26.473
that she was calling
home during the day.

39:27.128 --> 39:29.591
And we also know from a witness

39:29.758 --> 39:32.070
that she was arguing with
someone

39:32.145 --> 39:34.593
about putting you into this lovely

39:34.875 --> 39:36.732
assisted living center
people are just

39:36.788 --> 39:38.310
dying to get out of.

39:39.018 --> 39:40.892
But David wasn't home
during the day.

39:41.257 --> 39:43.132
You've just gone and written out
a schedule for me.

39:43.376 --> 39:45.511
So who was she arguing with ?

39:48.778 --> 39:49.642
You.

39:50.267 --> 39:51.611
Goodness gracious.

39:52.017 --> 39:53.010
It's her.

39:54.165 --> 39:55.702
<i>Because lakeview terrace</i>

39:55.747 --> 39:57.022
which has neither a lake

39:57.268 --> 40:00.292
nor a terrace called last week.
And guess what ?

40:00.827 --> 40:02.182
Your room's ready

40:02.858 --> 40:04.362
But I don't think you want it.

40:04.436 --> 40:06.562
In fact, I think you're
terrified of going there.

40:06.876 --> 40:09.270
And you knew that there'd been
threats against the jury

40:09.287 --> 40:10.861
that your daughter-in-law
was serving on.

40:10.895 --> 40:13.073
So you decided to use
these threats for cover.

40:13.348 --> 40:15.821
So you ground up 16 digoxin pills

40:16.156 --> 40:17.792
pulled apart these capsules,

40:17.888 --> 40:19.703
substituted the contents

40:20.356 --> 40:22.281
of Bela's heart medication

40:22.336 --> 40:24.351
and popped them back
into her pillbox

40:24.866 --> 40:27.042
knowing full well that
when Bela took her vitamins

40:27.048 --> 40:28.520
she'd keel over dead.

40:31.316 --> 40:33.672
And you were only defending yourself.

40:34.547 --> 40:36.811
It was wrong what they were doing.

40:36.897 --> 40:39.690
Why, I'd never put my mother
in an assisted living center.

40:39.976 --> 40:41.710
I'd take care of her myself

40:41.717 --> 40:43.412
because she took care of me.

40:45.798 --> 40:48.051
<i>Is that how your son felt
about you ?</i>

40:49.356 --> 40:51.811
Or was he more worried
about Bela's heart ?

40:55.236 --> 40:56.812
Bela didn't have a heart.

40:58.517 --> 41:00.881
She used me up is
what she did.

41:01.658 --> 41:03.111
She exhausted me.

41:03.786 --> 41:05.731
She worked me like a dog

41:06.076 --> 41:07.642
so she could shop

41:07.725 --> 41:09.603
and have dinner and work.

41:10.307 --> 41:11.642
And if she could have

41:12.215 --> 41:15.410
she'd have dropped me off at the
vet's and had them put me to sleep.

41:19.068 --> 41:21.132
The smell at lakeview terrace.

41:21.757 --> 41:23.251
The smell.

41:25.295 --> 41:27.841
I didn't deserve to die in that smell.

41:31.645 --> 41:34.623
What can you possibly do to me
that would be worse than that ?

41:35.596 --> 41:37.821
I didn't deserve to die in that smell

41:38.308 --> 41:40.002
after all I did for them.

41:41.687 --> 41:43.072
I didn't deserve it.

42:05.407 --> 42:07.102
I am so excited.

42:07.635 --> 42:09.252
A dinner out in hollywood

42:09.286 --> 42:11.382
and a special surprise.

42:11.566 --> 42:13.501
Are we gonna see some movie stars ?

42:14.187 --> 42:16.853
Not that Angelina Jolie but

42:16.945 --> 42:18.683
maybe George Clooney

42:19.727 --> 42:22.213
you're sure in a better mood
than you were after the funeral.

42:22.366 --> 42:25.010
Well, your aunt Floetta had been
brain-dead

42:25.017 --> 42:26.722
for so long, anyway.

42:27.236 --> 42:29.201
And your aunt Denise drinks a little.

42:29.927 --> 42:31.051
The truth is,

42:31.307 --> 42:34.111
I just wanted to spend some time
with you, Brenda Leigh

42:34.127 --> 42:37.313
I miss you. I miss you very much.

42:38.065 --> 42:39.652
I miss you too, Mama.

42:41.476 --> 42:44.140
Goodness, is someone coming with us ?

42:45.718 --> 42:48.072
Is that it ? Is that the surprise ?

42:48.127 --> 42:50.553
- Ooh ! Is that it ?
- Yes. Now, mama,

42:50.555 --> 42:52.963
I don't want you to get all
excited about this and all

42:53.287 --> 42:54.852
You know too happy.

42:55.008 --> 42:56.922
You're dating someone !

42:56.928 --> 42:59.342
Oh, honey, how wonderful !

42:59.387 --> 43:01.620
I can't wait to tell your father

43:01.785 --> 43:04.010
Mama ? Too happy Too happy.

43:04.037 --> 43:05.481
What does he do for a living ?

43:06.035 --> 43:07.853
He's a special agent for the F.B.I.

43:08.105 --> 43:09.813
He has a job, too !

43:10.417 --> 43:11.963
And it must be serious

43:12.018 --> 43:13.811
because you're introducing us.

43:13.826 --> 43:15.293
Not unless you let me go.

43:19.838 --> 43:22.862
- Fritz, come in.
- Thank you, Brenda.

43:26.468 --> 43:28.982
Fritz Howard, I'd like
you to meet my mama

43:29.777 --> 43:32.463
- Willie Ray Johnson
- It's a pleasure, ma'am.

43:33.328 --> 43:35.100
How lovely why !

43:35.128 --> 43:37.683
Thank you.Thank you so much.

43:38.237 --> 43:40.343
I was just asking Brenda

43:40.368 --> 43:42.562
if we were gonna see some movie stars

43:42.668 --> 43:44.402
and you walk through the door.

43:44.427 --> 43:46.050
So handsome.

43:47.325 --> 43:49.310
I'll just snip the ends off these

43:49.317 --> 43:50.831
and find something to put them in

43:50.847 --> 43:53.351
and then we'll be right off
for dinner.

43:58.887 --> 44:01.773
- Shall I tell her where the vase is ?
- No, no. No.

44:05.805 --> 44:08.843
I want to thank you so much for
moving everything out

44:09.225 --> 44:11.242
yesterday and for coming back
tonight.

44:11.257 --> 44:13.123
- For dinner.
- For dinner.

44:17.085 --> 44:19.001
But the U-Haul's still out front.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.870
There's a limit to how long
it's gonna stay there.

44:36.927 --> 44:38.780
It's a flexible limit.

44:40.045 --> 44:41.502
Smile !
