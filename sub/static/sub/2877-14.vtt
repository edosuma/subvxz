WEBVTT

00:03.796 --> 00:05.589
Thank you guys for having us over.

00:05.756 --> 00:09.260
- Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
- I don't know why we don't hang out...

00:09.427 --> 00:12.596
- ...with married couples more often.
- Because every time we do...

00:12.763 --> 00:15.975
...you make jokes about swinging
and scare them away.

00:17.101 --> 00:21.022
You mean that Portuguese couple?
Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.735
Hey, you guys, I have great news.

00:25.943 --> 00:30.948
- Ross, we're kind of in the middle of dinner.
- Oh, well, I already ate, but sure.

00:33.284 --> 00:37.288
- Guess what happened at work today.
- A dinosaur died a million years ago?

00:37.455 --> 00:41.459
Uh, try 65 million years ago.
And then try: Shh!

00:42.960 --> 00:47.673
My tenure review board met today,
and I hear it's looking really good.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.883
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.677
Do you have any idea what this
means in academic circles?

00:51.844 --> 00:53.888
I am gonna get laid.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.142
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.643
Oh, Italian.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.354
No one...
No one wanted seconds, right?

01:02.521 --> 01:03.898
No, I'm good.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.568
Guys, you're never gonna believe it.
This headhunter called me.

01:07.777 --> 01:11.739
I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci.
Gucci wants me.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.824
- I'm up for tenure.
- Congratulations.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.911
- You too. What are the odds?
- Oh...

01:17.161 --> 01:18.662
Guess what.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.792
I finally got that seed out of my teeth.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.212
I don't know who I'm happiest for.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.090
I do. He's been working on that all day.

02:21.392 --> 02:25.271
Hey, Mon, was it weird
changing your name to Geller Bing?

02:25.521 --> 02:29.191
No. No, it felt nice to acknowledge this.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.861
- Where'd you go to do it?
- Um, the...

02:32.027 --> 02:34.905
The Ministry of Names...

02:36.448 --> 02:37.741
...Bureau.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.077
You never did it.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.538
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of...

02:42.746 --> 02:45.457
Of being an official Bing.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.587
Hey, I will have you know that...

02:49.753 --> 02:53.841
Ah, who am I kidding? Let's call the kid
Geller and let Bing die with me.

02:55.801 --> 02:56.886
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.054
Honey, would you want me
to take your name?

02:59.263 --> 03:02.474
Oh, it's up to you. It's your name.
You've gotta live with it.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.936
- Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hannigan.
- Mrs. Hannigan?

03:06.103 --> 03:08.439
What, can't you see I'm
in the middle of something?

03:10.191 --> 03:11.692
I like it.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.612
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Joe.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.740
We got things to check out
at the new house. You want to come?

03:17.907 --> 03:21.202
- No, thank you.
- You're not happy about us moving...

03:21.368 --> 03:23.787
...but you're the only one
who hasn't seen the house.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.623
You'll see how close it is to the city.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.626
No, it's not close.
You said it was in escrow.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.003
I couldn't even find that on the map.

03:34.590 --> 03:38.010
Joey, please come.
It would mean so much to us.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.973
You know what? You are my friends.
I want to be supportive.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.392
- I will come with you. Shotgun.
- Damn it.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.479
See you guys later.
We'll pick you up at 11.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.689
- So glad you're coming.
- All right.

03:51.649 --> 03:55.194
- Good for you. That was really mature.
- What? The only reason I'm going...

03:55.361 --> 03:58.656
...to their stupid new house is to
point out everything wrong with it...

03:58.822 --> 04:01.533
...so they don't move.
I'm gonna make them stay here.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.370
You're a strange kind of grown-up.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.291
Joey, you can't make someone do
something they don't want to do.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.962
Believe me. There's something I've been
trying to get Mike to do in bed, and...

04:13.128 --> 04:18.466
- Whoa. Can we not talk about that now?
- All right. Prude.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.222
Look, Monica and Chandler
really love this house.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.683
You are not gonna talk them
into staying here.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.560
Hey, I can convince people
to do anything, you know?

04:28.727 --> 04:31.897
I bet I could even get Mike
to do that thing. What is it'?

04:34.942 --> 04:37.695
I am not gonna help you do that!

04:37.861 --> 04:39.905
Oh, my God.

04:46.161 --> 04:50.332
Hi. Um, I'm here to see Mr. Campbell,
with Gucci.

04:50.499 --> 04:53.585
The reservation's probably under Gucci.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.839
It's spelled like "gucky,"
which can be confusing.

04:57.881 --> 05:01.635
Mr. Campbell's not here yet.
Let me show you to his table.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.434
Oh, my God. That's my boss.
You have to seat us somewhere else.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.811
I'm sorry, that's always
Mr. Campbell's table.

05:10.978 --> 05:15.024
But my boss cannot see me.
I'm interviewing for another job.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.694
- I know. With Gucky.
- Shh!

05:19.903 --> 05:23.782
- Rachel?
- I'm on a date.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.327
That's great.

05:26.493 --> 05:30.039
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough.
Single mom. Career.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.833
You gotta get out there.

05:33.042 --> 05:36.587
- Well, you've got a good energy.
- Oh.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.088
- Rachel?
- Yes, hi.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.715
- James Campbell.
- Hi.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.425
- Excuse us.
- Please.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.926
Okay.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.136
Oh.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.097
He's cute.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.099
So...

05:49.266 --> 05:51.685
...your resume is quite impressive.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.939
My, ha, ha... My résumé?

05:56.106 --> 06:01.487
I wouldn't... I wouldn't call
my online dating profile a résumé.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.032
Dating profile? No, I'm...
I'm talking about the work résumé.

06:08.786 --> 06:12.456
Whatever happened to just singing
for no reason?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.377
Maybe people found it weird.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.963
- Maybe.
- 80...

06:20.506 --> 06:23.467
- Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
- What?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.302
- I don't.
- You don't?

06:25.469 --> 06:27.346
No, I love... I love it there.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.682
Well, if you don't want to leave,
why are we having this lunch?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.185
That is my boss.

06:33.352 --> 06:34.436
What?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.563
That is my boss.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.482
That's Hugo Boss?

06:45.614 --> 06:50.035
God, this place is so depressing.
If I had to work here, I'd kill myself.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.582
But you obviously haven't.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.837
- How can I help you?
- I need to change my name, please.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.674
See, I need to change it
because I'm hiding from the law.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.719
You're fun.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.973
- You need to fill out this form.
- Okay. Well, just so I know...

07:11.140 --> 07:13.475
I don't know how it works.
My name is Buffay...

07:13.642 --> 07:15.436
...and my husband's name is Hannigan.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.689
So is it supposed to be
"Buffay-Hannigan" or "Hannigan-Buffay"?

07:18.856 --> 07:21.442
- It can be anything you want.
- Well, not anything.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.153
Yeah. Anything.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.031
Oh, this could take a while.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.910
- Get out of my line.
- Okay.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.749
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.586
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.256
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.
- Wrong again.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.218
Apparently,
you can change it to anything.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.430
So I thought, "All right, here's an
opportunity to be creative."

07:51.597 --> 07:55.350
So meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.193
That's what we were
gonna name the baby.

08:06.778 --> 08:10.324
- Phoebe.
- Ah, Princess Consuela.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.202
- You changed your name to that?
- Uh-huh.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.580
Okay, so from now on, we have to call
you Princess Consuela?

08:16.747 --> 08:19.917
No, I'm gonna have my friends
call me Valerie.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.382
- Hey, how did the interview go?
- Ugh. Not good.

08:27.591 --> 08:31.637
I always feel that way after an interview
I'll bet it went better than you think.

08:31.803 --> 08:36.683
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci
and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.144
That is a bad interview.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.772
What are you talking about?
How did this happen?

08:41.938 --> 08:45.901
My boss was at the same restaurant
where I was having my interview...

08:46.109 --> 08:47.528
...and he heard everything.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.532
Later, he calls me into his office
and tells me he'll have to let me go...

08:51.698 --> 08:53.325
...because I'm not a team player.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.494
And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."

08:55.661 --> 08:58.121
And then I had to sit there
for 45 minutes...

08:58.288 --> 09:02.876
...while he proved that
that, in fact, was true.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.797
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- God.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.674
H93'-

09:08.840 --> 09:11.969
What...? What's this?

09:12.135 --> 09:16.181
Why, it's a bottle of champagne.
Why is this here?

09:16.348 --> 09:18.100
- Ross.
- I guess it's here...

09:18.267 --> 09:19.851
...because I got tenure!

09:20.018 --> 09:21.937
- Congratulations.
- Wow.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.357
This is the single greatest day
of my professional career.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.693
- Gunther. Six glasses.
- Six?

09:27.859 --> 09:31.405
- You want me to join you?
- I thought Joey was here. Five is good.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.078
Wow, I'm gonna have a loogey
in my coffee tomorrow.

09:38.537 --> 09:41.623
Ooh. Israeli champagne.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.001
And it's vanilla.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.254
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.674
Hey, Rach, so, uh,
how did your thing go?

09:50.841 --> 09:53.760
Oh, good. But I won't hear about that
for a couple days.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.097
Oh, you know what,
you're gonna get it. I can feel it.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.932
Can you?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.393
All right, everybody, here's to Ross.

10:01.560 --> 10:06.064
And to years of hard work
finally paying off.

10:06.231 --> 10:10.235
And to knowing that your career
doesn't mean everything.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.239
But also knowing it means a lot.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.909
But more importantly, to full,
well-rounded lives.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.870
That center around work.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.039
- To Ross.
- To Ross.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.588
You know what the best part
about this is? I can never be fired.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.131
- Oh, God.
- No, seriously.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.634
I have job security for life.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.178
You know?
I mean, I never have to worry.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.765
Oh, look at you.
Look how happy you are for me.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.646
No, it's not that. I got fired today.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.106
And I didn't get the other job.

10:50.776 --> 10:54.363
- Oh, my... Rach, I'm so sorry.
- Oh...

10:54.529 --> 10:58.283
- Great, I feel like an idiot.
- No, it's okay. You didn't know.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.037
Little heads-up would've been nice.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.465
Thank you for letting us
see the house again.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.218
And thank you for explaining
to us what "escrow" means.

11:16.385 --> 11:19.429
I've already forgotten what you said,
but thank you.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.641
Take as long as you want.
Just let me know when you're through.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.351
Okay, thanks.

11:24.643 --> 11:28.730
- Aw, so glad you decided to come.
- Me, too. Yeah, this place is great.

11:28.897 --> 11:33.610
So happy for you guys. Although,
you know, I hope you like fungus.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.446
- What?
- Fungus.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.365
Yeah. Place is full of it.

11:38.907 --> 11:42.160
No, it's not. We had an inspection
and they didn't find anything.

11:42.327 --> 11:45.872
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
and a scratchy throat for no reason.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.959
Maybe it's because you hung your head
out the window like a dog...

11:49.126 --> 11:50.836
...the whole ride here.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.214
Maybe.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.760
So this is the living room, huh?
It's pretty dark.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.474
- No, it's not.
- Are you kidding?

12:04.641 --> 12:07.185
I think I just saw a bat in the corner.

12:07.894 --> 12:12.190
When your head was hanging out
the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

12:13.525 --> 12:14.860
Maybe.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.448
Look, I just think you guys can
do better than this house, you know?

12:19.614 --> 12:21.533
Or any other house for that matter.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.993
Oh, Joey.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.787
We know you're having a hard
time with this, but we...

12:25.954 --> 12:28.665
- We love it here.
- Fine! If you love this house so much...

12:28.832 --> 12:32.002
...you should live here. I hope you
get used to that humming sound.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.174
- Joey, we know that's you.
- No...

12:37.340 --> 12:38.383
...it's not.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.723
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.017
- Welcome back.
- I missed you.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.977
- Oh, me too.
- So, what's new?

12:49.186 --> 12:51.605
Well, I am no longer Phoebe Buffay.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.274
- That's great. You changed your name?
- Yes, I did.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.570
Meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.240
- You're kidding, right?
- Nope.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.409
- You really did that?
- Yep.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.745
You can't do that.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.246
Why?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.750
Why? It's fun. It's different.
No one else has a name like it.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.045
Then I'm gonna change my name.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.422
Great. Okay, what are
you gonna change it to?

13:18.048 --> 13:19.508
Crap B39-

13:21.218 --> 13:24.846
- Mike Crap Bag?
- No. No "Mike." No, just "Crap Bag."

13:25.013 --> 13:28.016
First name: Crap. Last name: Bag.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.102
- You're not serious, right?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.939
It's fun, it's different,
and no one else has a name like that.

13:34.105 --> 13:38.360
Uh-huh. Well, then great.
lfyouloveiLlloveiL

13:38.568 --> 13:41.613
I do love it. And I love your name.
I love Princess Consuela.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.032
And I love Crap.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.164
Oh.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.253
- Who are you?
- Oh, hi. I'm Joey.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.297
My stupid friends are buying this house.
Who are you?

13:59.548 --> 14:03.343
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents
are selling this house.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.305
I hate my parents.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.808
I hate my friends.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.981
Look, there's gotta be a way
that we can stop this from happening.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.732
Like what?

14:19.025 --> 14:23.697
Oh! Okay, you come with me and you
tell them that the house is haunted.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.032
What are you, 8?

14:28.118 --> 14:34.165
- Okay. Let's hear your great idea.
- I don't have any great ideas. I am 8.

14:35.959 --> 14:39.296
Ah, there's gotta be a way.
I mean, you know...

14:39.462 --> 14:42.799
...if Monica and Chandler move out here,
and Phoebe's married to Mike...

14:42.966 --> 14:46.678
...that just leaves me and Ross and Rach.
You know what I mean?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.763
I really don't.

14:50.056 --> 14:53.226
What am I gonna do?
I feel like I'm losing my friends.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.688
- My parents say I'll make new friends.
- Yeah, sure, easy for you.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.858
You're young. Me? I'm set in my ways.

15:01.484 --> 15:05.363
This is what my mom was talking about.
Whiners are wieners.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.703
Look, you want your friends
to be happy, right?

15:12.954 --> 15:15.498
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.920
Well, if moving here is gonna make them
happy, don't you want them to do it'?

15:20.462 --> 15:23.131
Yeah. Maybe.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.468
Then you've gotta let them go.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.850
Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're...

15:34.017 --> 15:36.394
You're probably right.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.730
How'd you get to be so smart?

15:40.023 --> 15:41.107
I read a lot.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.111
Just when I thought we could be friends.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.118
Oh, hey, Rach. I just heard. I'm so sorry.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.162
Oh, thank you...

15:54.913 --> 15:57.207
You still don't know my name, do you?

15:58.166 --> 16:00.085
Well, now I don't have to.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.509
Ross, what is taking you so long?

16:15.141 --> 16:19.562
I'm sorry. It's almost as if this wasn't
built for a quick getaway.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.900
Rachel?

16:24.359 --> 16:27.112
Mark? Oh, my God.

16:27.362 --> 16:30.865
- How have you been?
- Fantastic. You remember Ross.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.201
- Sure. Sure.
- Oh.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.786
What's with the chair?

16:35.954 --> 16:41.042
Uh... You know, you can't always
get a seat on the subway, so...

16:42.293 --> 16:44.087
Clever.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.422
So how are you?

16:45.588 --> 16:48.216
Oh. You're not catching me
on my best day.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.428
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff
doesn't say "big promotion."

16:51.594 --> 16:55.265
No, but it's good. You know,
I'm gonna take some time off...

16:55.432 --> 16:57.434
- ...and do charity work.
- Are you sure?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.436
We may have something
at Louis Vuitton.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.105
Screw charity work. What do you got?

17:02.272 --> 17:04.148
Why don't we have dinner and talk?

17:04.773 --> 17:07.109
- Great. I'll call you.
- Okay.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.988
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.

17:16.828 --> 17:17.871
Oh, my God.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.330
See? I told you something good
would come along.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.460
And he seemed really nice.
I've met him before?

17:23.626 --> 17:25.627
Ross, that's Mark.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.716
From Bloomingdale's?
You were insanely jealous of him.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.760
- That is Mark?
- Yes.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.344
- I hate that guy.
- Oh...

17:34.471 --> 17:37.182
No, no, no.
You cannot go to dinner with him.

17:37.348 --> 17:41.019
- What? You don't want me to get a job?
- Yeah, I'm sure he'll give you a job.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.146
Maybe make you his "sex-cretary."

17:44.147 --> 17:46.524
I'm serious.
I just don't trust that guy, okay?

17:46.733 --> 17:50.070
You know what...? Okay, let's talk
about it later. There comes security.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.541
Oh, I love this street.

18:03.750 --> 18:08.546
The trees and the big front yards
and the actual picket fences.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.382
Man, those two dogs are going at it.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.011
H93'-

18:15.178 --> 18:18.515
- Hey. Where you been?
- Oh, just, uh, you know, looking around.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.183
But you know what?

18:20.350 --> 18:22.602
This house is great.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.562
Really? What changed your mind?

18:24.813 --> 18:28.483
The little girl who lives here made me
feel better about the whole thing.

18:28.983 --> 18:33.321
Joey? There was a little girl who lived here,
but she died, like, 30 years ago.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.036
What?

18:41.037 --> 18:43.373
I'm just messing with you.

18:44.165 --> 18:48.044
That's not funny.
You know I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.756
Joey, now that you're okay with the house,
do you want to go see your room?

18:52.549 --> 18:53.842
What?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.260
I get my own room?

18:56.094 --> 18:59.430
You don't think we'd buy a house
and not have a Joey room, do you?

19:00.223 --> 19:02.100
Oh, my God.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.523
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?

19:10.066 --> 19:13.903
- No.
- Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.825
After you, Ms. Bananahammock.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.451
Thank you, Mr. Bag.

19:21.744 --> 19:22.787
Oh, hey!

19:22.954 --> 19:24.539
- Oh, hi, Rita.
- How are you?

19:24.706 --> 19:26.749
Good. Oh, Rita's a massage client.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.459
Yeah.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.420
Why don't you introduce me?

19:32.922 --> 19:35.633
- Rita, this is my husband.
- Oh.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.219
Why don't you tell her my name?

19:38.887 --> 19:43.725
Okay, I will. This is, uh...
This is my husband, Crap Bag.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.936
Crap Bag?

19:47.103 --> 19:51.858
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.488
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

19:58.573 --> 20:03.661
Ugh. Okay, fine, you made your point. Can
you please just be Mike Hannigan again?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.413
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.959
How about, um...?
How about Buffay-Hannigan?

20:10.126 --> 20:11.961
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.131
I'm Phoebe
Buffay-Hannigan-Bananahammock.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.344
Do you even know what
a banana hammock is?

20:19.761 --> 20:21.346
It's a funny word.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.264
It's a Speedo.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.020
Oh, crap.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.485
- Hey, is Rachel here?
- Nope.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.362
She's still at dinner?

20:37.528 --> 20:39.948
- I guess. Why, who's she with?
- That guy, Mark...

20:40.114 --> 20:43.201
...from Bloomingdale's.
She thinks he's just being nice to her.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.495
But I know he really wants
to sleep with her.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.498
It's seven years ago.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.043
My time machine works.

20:53.461 --> 20:57.131
We ran into him on the street today,
and he said he might have a job for her.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.968
But I know he just wants
to get into her pants.

21:00.677 --> 21:05.056
So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single, and he's cute.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.808
Excuse me?

21:07.058 --> 21:08.518
Oh, please.

21:08.685 --> 21:11.187
Yesterday, on the subway,
you couldn't stop staring...

21:11.354 --> 21:13.231
...at that woman with the big breasts.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.025
For your information,
I was staring at her baby.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.236
We're about to be parents.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.030
Oh, sorry.

21:30.999 --> 21:34.043
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi. So...

21:34.210 --> 21:37.755
- ...how was dinner?
- Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.718
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I wonder why? What
could that smarmy letch possibly want?

21:41.884 --> 21:47.265
Oh, Ross. Come on. He is happily married.
His wife just had twins.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.559
Should we send something?

21:50.893 --> 21:52.645
How did the job stuff go?

21:53.771 --> 21:55.189
He offered me one.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.568
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.611
I know, it's amazing.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.741
It's amazing. It's so much better
than what I had at Ralph Lauren.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.368
- The money is great.
- Can we...?

22:07.535 --> 22:12.040
Can we just stop for a second? Who said
something better would come along? Huh?

22:12.206 --> 22:15.543
You didn't believe me. I told you
everything was gonna work out.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.880
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of Israel's finest.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.553
The job is in Paris.

22:38.274 --> 22:41.194
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig...

22:41.361 --> 22:43.196
...but am I missing opportunities?

22:43.363 --> 22:46.282
You know, I've always thought of myself
as a serious actor.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.951
Should I be trying to do more
independent movies?

22:49.410 --> 22:51.412
I don't know.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.291
But you know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.210
Hold on.

22:58.503 --> 23:01.047
Hey, Bailey, I need some career advice.
