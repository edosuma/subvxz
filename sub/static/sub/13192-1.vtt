01:44.905 --> 01:46.600
Hey, Phones, good morning.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.268
Hey, what's happening, buddy?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.642
Let's go skate, come on.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.807
Hey, Bobby.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.313
Look, it's Jumping Jack Flash!

04:58.298 --> 05:00.460
- It's Conway!
- Oh, no!

05:14.281 --> 05:15.476
Hang on!

06:43.703 --> 06:45.467
- Good morning, Ada.
- Good morning, Terry.

06:45.538 --> 06:48.166
- Is everyone up yet?
- In the dining room.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.912
Eggs soft enough, Roger?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.380
Good morning, lovey. Drink your juice.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.860
Well, I thought I'd go down
to the beach today and commit suicide.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.367
That's nice, lovey. Have a good day.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.686
Well, if anybody wants me,
I'll be at the city morgue.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.090
Kids.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.014
Let's go.

08:40.086 --> 08:43.249
You and your fads, Terry.
Honestly, roller skating?

08:43.323 --> 08:47.260
Next thing, you'll have me surfing,
or some such horrendous thing.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.022
You'd rather not go?

08:49.662 --> 08:52.154
Not after I bought my skate bag at Gucci's.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.948
Okay, thank you.
Have a nice day. Stay off the bike path.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.384
- How you doing, Phones?
- Okay.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.179
- You need these?
- No.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.582
Have a nice day. We'll see you later, okay?

10:26.659 --> 10:30.823
- Listen. This is great! This is bad!
- Hey, Phones. What's happening, man?

10:30.897 --> 10:33.992
You're looking fantastic
for the Roller Boogie contest.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.229
Bobby, why don't you come
and skate with us, okay?

10:38.605 --> 10:42.633
- Baby, I gotta work.
- Come on, please? Just for a little while.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.837
- Skate with us.
- Please?

10:44.911 --> 10:48.176
All right. I'll be back. Take care of the place.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.202
Come on, man. Do it!

11:53.813 --> 11:55.577
Come on, Bobby!

11:56.049 --> 11:59.178
- You're next.
- I don't think so.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.994
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.432
Your money or your life, twinkle boots.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.734
Yeah, how'd you like your neck
permanent waved?

12:20.807 --> 12:23.970
He's turning blue, homeboy.
He's turning blue!

12:24.611 --> 12:26.079
Sorry, Bobby.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.849
The guy's working out.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.179
Here's yours.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.213
You guys know that girl?

12:34.287 --> 12:36.915
You mean, "Don't touch me, you brute?"

12:36.990 --> 12:40.016
Yeah, I just saw her pull in
in a million-dollar car...

12:40.093 --> 12:41.959
over at the parking lot.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.165
Probably some rink skater
from Beverly Hills.

12:45.231 --> 12:48.792
No, man.
No rinks in Beverly Hills, just minks.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.329
Come on, forget it, Bobby.
She is way out of your league, man.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.807
My Franklin, your Theresa.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.916
Our two geniuses.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.165
So we thought about London
or the Paris Conservatory...

13:57.403 --> 13:59.929
but we accepted the Juilliard scholarship...

14:00.006 --> 14:02.737
because we could just hop over,
stay in the Hamptons--

14:02.809 --> 14:06.109
- And shopping in Manhattan.
- Lillian, please, I'm talking.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.282
Then, we could see Theresa,
be back here in no time at all.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.614
Actually, I think New York
would be good for her.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.950
A more mature attitude toward her music
and all that, you know.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.457
Sitting on the lap of creativity.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.287
I'm sorry, he put his hands on...

14:24.364 --> 14:28.323
I mean, it was an accident. I'm sorry.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.133
- Franklin, take those off!
- In the house.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.984
Franklin, I swear!

14:55.461 --> 14:57.452
You have more hands than a poker game!

14:57.530 --> 14:59.362
Going slumming at the beach again?

14:59.432 --> 15:01.491
Your mother thinks
you're going out with me.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.934
Franklin, I'm not in the mood
for octopus rally!

15:04.003 --> 15:06.631
Terry, I need you.
Your body is driving me crazy.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.198
Franklin, Barbie dolls drive you crazy.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.801
- You're oversexed.
- Come on, Terry.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.113
Franklin, stop it!

15:14.647 --> 15:17.116
Terry, give me back that towel.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.547
Terry, I'm sorry. Please, come on.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.816
My mother's inside.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.784
So what? It's not that big a thing, anyway.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.953
Terry, come on. Come back!

15:31.364 --> 15:32.889
Bye.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.275
Terry, come back!

15:49.315 --> 15:50.510
Mother.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.050
- And he is the best we got.
- Excuse me.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.283
- You guys, look here.
- Excuse me.

15:57.890 --> 16:01.918
It's the golden girls of Beverly Hills.
How's old Bev Hills these days?

16:01.994 --> 16:05.055
- Let me help you.
- All right, a telephone, man!

16:06.399 --> 16:07.491
Give me Alaska.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.899
Let me get your bag for you, okay?
Here you go.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.563
How you doing?
My name is Gordo, remember me?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.265
How you doing?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.675
Hope you have a good time skating.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.973
Excuse me, Miss Buns.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.889
Come on, will you, Bobby.

16:32.959 --> 16:37.021
Come on, look at her car, man.
Look at her car, then look at yourself.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.428
That's three things that don't match:

16:39.499 --> 16:42.764
this car, you, and that chick.
I'm telling you, man.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.532
I got $5 says she'll skate with me tonight.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.267
You do? $5? You're on, sucker.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.537
- Here's mine.
- What is this?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.944
That's my IOU. I'm good for it.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.785
Come on, let's go.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.253
Hey! Are you crazy?

20:32.298 --> 20:33.561
What was that?

20:33.632 --> 20:37.364
That was Complete Control Conway,
the one-man destruction derby.

20:38.204 --> 20:41.663
- Lovely. I'm fine, thank you.
- You sure are.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.309
- You can let go now.
- I know that.

20:45.377 --> 20:48.813
- Would you do it?
- Not until you say you'll skate with me.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.815
Hey, I saved your life.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.427
You're the best skater
on the boardwalk, true?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.486
I don't know. I do okay.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.465
I need someone to teach me
how to dance on skates.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.502
I'll pay you $10 an hour.

21:12.371 --> 21:15.238
Here's $5 in advance. I'm gonna freshen up.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.148
You ain't skating with her yet.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.218
Say, look, you!

21:32.024 --> 21:34.755
- Yes?
- Something about this isn't right.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.823
Hey, wait up!

21:42.668 --> 21:44.033
Sorry, ladies.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.605
Okay, everybody, it's time to play.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.342
It is couples-only time. Couples only.

22:07.626 --> 22:10.618
Come on, this is a good song.
It's almost over.

22:12.698 --> 22:16.430
What's your name, anyway?
Did you see me in that commercial?

22:18.103 --> 22:19.969
I'll bet you can't skate, anyway.

22:24.710 --> 22:25.973
Ready?

22:26.946 --> 22:28.277
This is all screwed up.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.441
I'm supposed to ask you if you wanna skate.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.781
- Okay, ask.
- Do you wanna skate or something?

22:34.486 --> 22:36.818
Sure, I wanna skate or something.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.749
- Let's go.
- Okay.

23:12.424 --> 23:16.588
What are you, a prejudiced person?
Let's go out there and dance a little.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.459
You don't want to dance with me?

23:34.813 --> 23:36.872
You win, sucker. There.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.292
Don't get scared.
I'm gonna show you something.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.492
Just relax and stay loose.

24:16.956 --> 24:20.324
All right, it's time to get on down
with a new sound. Here we go.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.360
I think it's your wheel.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.196
$54.

24:27.533 --> 24:31.731
Bobby, you clown. You know
that music hurts my poor old ears.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.440
- Terry Barkley, Jammer Delany.
- Hi.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.766
Hello, love.

24:37.843 --> 24:40.869
- My God, but you sure are pretty.
- Thank you.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.513
- Anything she needs, I'm good for it.
- Okay.

24:43.582 --> 24:46.051
Did you know
Jam was eight-time National Champion?

24:46.118 --> 24:48.644
Fastest man through the pack on skates.

24:49.088 --> 24:52.752
That was until they took my knee cap apart
in six places.

24:53.459 --> 24:57.259
Boy, I'm telling you, skating's changed a lot
since I was a top jammer.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.660
I'm sure it has.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.699
- You got a wrench?
- I think so.

25:00.766 --> 25:01.824
Good.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.731
- Here we go.
- All right, thanks a lot, Jammer.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.532
You're welcome, Bobby.

25:06.605 --> 25:09.734
- Enjoy yourself now, love.
- I shall. Thank you.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.945
Wrong one.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.183
Top jammer?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.121
You know, Roller Derby.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.123
Sure, my parents watch it every night on TV.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.317
Okay.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.291
This one's just as nice as the other one.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.406
Hey, Terry, wait up.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.634
Wait up!

25:45.344 --> 25:47.540
Thanks for skating with me, kid.

25:47.613 --> 25:51.948
We still have 45 minutes left.
And my name ain't "Kid," it's Bobby.

25:52.017 --> 25:55.851
- Bobby James.
- Keep the change, Bobby James.

26:23.615 --> 26:26.084
Terry, will there be anything else?

26:26.452 --> 26:30.116
- No thanks, Ada. My folks come home yet?
- Child, didn't they tell you?

26:30.189 --> 26:33.489
They went to the Palm Springs house
for the weekend.

26:33.559 --> 26:34.822
I forgot.

26:35.561 --> 26:38.690
Listen, I can stay over
if you don't want to be alone.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.893
No, it's okay. You go on home.
I'll be fine, thank you.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.560
All right, dear.

26:44.503 --> 26:48.963
Last time my mama went to Palm Springs,
she came home with a new papa.

26:49.508 --> 26:53.069
- Now she's in Mexico, dear thing.
- Doing what, pray tell?

26:53.712 --> 26:58.206
Getting rid of my new papa.
Then it's back to the Springs for another try.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.511
My parents don't have to tell me
where they're going.

27:01.587 --> 27:04.056
Why should I tell them
where I'm going, right?

27:04.256 --> 27:05.917
Where are you going?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.523
Crazy! Anybody wanna come?

27:09.027 --> 27:11.223
She's off to the beach again.

27:11.597 --> 27:14.897
Her choice of friends
leaves something to be desired.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.061
She picked you, didn't she?

27:18.804 --> 27:21.865
Franklin, you nerd! You ruined my nails!

27:40.959 --> 27:43.485
Okay, put another 20 pounds on that, boy.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.656
Another 20 pounds, Master Hoppy?

27:45.731 --> 27:48.598
Why, sure enough, sir!
Coming right on up here.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.856
Okay, now.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.560
I got it!

28:22.067 --> 28:23.432
Okay.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.562
I think he's got it!

28:27.472 --> 28:30.669
How long have we had this chest pain,
my boy?

28:33.679 --> 28:36.239
- Get it off, you pinheads!
- Watch out.

28:39.484 --> 28:42.385
What the hell
do you think you're doing, man?

28:42.454 --> 28:43.922
These guys.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.320
We're going to the pier later.
You wanna come?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.483
I gotta practice.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.426
Come on, man.
There's a new waitress at Casa Cucaracha.

28:50.495 --> 28:54.864
- She wants your body anytime, day or night.
- She said she loved Olympic skaters.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.298
- She did not.
- Did, too.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.394
I got one hour of workout,
two hours practice.

28:59.571 --> 29:03.064
- You know my routine.
- All right, give it a break, man.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.576
- Let's go find some women.
<i>- I'll</i> see you later.

29:05.644 --> 29:07.772
- Come on!
- Don't be a drag!

29:09.248 --> 29:12.980
Get off my case!
My time is my own, you get it?

29:15.387 --> 29:19.187
No Olympic judge is gonna vote
for a turkey boardwalk skater.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.861
That waitress...

29:32.471 --> 29:34.132
is she a real fox?

29:34.206 --> 29:38.109
- Yeah, a fox, man.
- That chick's uglier than her enchiladas.

29:44.116 --> 29:48.849
Rich chicks, gold medals, Olympics...
Always wants something he can't have.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.798
You're gonna regret this in the morning.

30:05.871 --> 30:10.240
They're just your parents, Barkley.
They're not supposed to understand.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.441
I don't give a damn
if they don't have time for me anymore.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.378
I'm a big girl, right?

30:15.447 --> 30:18.382
Who needs to know where they're going
or when they'll be back.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.316
They don't owe me anything.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.047
Your mother brings you a new father
when she comes home.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.680
That's something, at least.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.850
You are acting so childish.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.960
Our little genius
is throwing a temper tantrum.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.488
When are you gonna come back?

30:35.534 --> 30:37.730
I'll be back when I get here.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.265
- Let's go.
- Oh, it's you.

31:12.637 --> 31:16.596
- You still owe me 45 minutes.
- You got a mental problem or something?

31:16.675 --> 31:18.973
You wanna skate,
and then you don't wanna skate.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.637
What is it with you?

31:21.246 --> 31:24.876
- I was watching you. You're very good.
- I know that.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.844
Well, excuse me if you don't have time.

31:29.921 --> 31:32.253
Sit down. I'll be just a minute.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.270
If that was meant to impress me, it did.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.604
You're very good.
You should do something with that talent.

31:50.675 --> 31:52.939
The Olympics will be around soon.

31:53.011 --> 31:55.708
The Olympics? That's a lot to bite off.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.780
- I got a big appetite.
- I guess you do.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.352
Okay, let's do it!

32:04.456 --> 32:08.120
- Are we gonna do it right here?
- Anywhere you want to.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.089
You don't waste any time, do you?

32:12.164 --> 32:15.429
- I was talking about skating.
- Sure you were.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.633
Is that one of your better moves?

32:22.607 --> 32:25.201
Where is she? This really gripes me.

33:14.192 --> 33:15.660
What's wrong?

33:16.127 --> 33:17.652
Nothing's wrong.

33:18.296 --> 33:20.321
I just don't understand you.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.759
You coming on so strong and all.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.096
What do you want from me?

33:27.239 --> 33:29.765
What does any woman want from a man?

33:30.408 --> 33:33.343
Look, you're not
no bimbo from the boardwalk.

33:34.412 --> 33:36.608
Are you sure you wanna do it?

33:37.349 --> 33:39.784
I don't believe you just said that.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.815
I don't believe I said it, either.

33:44.289 --> 33:47.554
You're not figuring on
paying me for this, too, are you?

33:48.126 --> 33:50.925
What in the hell was that for?
I mean, you started it!

33:50.996 --> 33:53.931
Because I didn't plan
to be seduced on the beach!

33:56.935 --> 33:59.461
You just wanna
forget about the whole thing?

34:00.438 --> 34:04.534
I just wanted someone to hold me.
Was that too much to ask for?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.972
Terry, wait up.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.491
Where have you been?
We've been looking everywhere.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.755
When are you gonna
give up this tacky scene?

34:23.828 --> 34:26.661
- What's wrong?
- Fella, I don't know who you are...

34:26.731 --> 34:30.167
or what you are,
but I don't like the look of this, understand?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.033
Get your hands off me!

34:33.271 --> 34:34.739
Look, fella, I said--

34:42.647 --> 34:46.049
Just marvelous!
Now how are we gonna get home?

34:47.786 --> 34:51.449
My humble chariot at your service, madam.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.884
May I recommend a passion fruit?

34:56.061 --> 34:58.029
Come on, right this way.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.525
I think he broke my nose.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.333
Let's just get you to the hospital then.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.276
Hey, you.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.453
Taking the kook to the hospital room!

35:24.522 --> 35:26.490
Yeah, and then to Lana's.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.466
What's the matter, lovey?
Why are you sitting on the stairs?

35:36.534 --> 35:40.334
Franklin Potter breaking your heart?
I'll have a talk with his mother.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.465
- Do you love me?
- What a question to ask.

35:45.110 --> 35:49.411
- What about Daddy?
- Lovey, where is all this going?

35:49.981 --> 35:54.475
At the end of summer, I go to school.
When I come back, I'll be a woman.

35:55.186 --> 35:58.383
- Yes, but--
- I never had a chance to be young!

35:58.990 --> 36:00.890
Lovey, you are different.

36:01.026 --> 36:04.553
Even your father doesn't understand
how you do those things with music.

36:04.663 --> 36:09.066
So what? I'm a musical genius.
What a drag! What a bummer!

36:09.200 --> 36:11.294
Drag? Bummer?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.805
Lovey, you're giving your mother
a migraine.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.797
Diet pills...

36:19.177 --> 36:23.478
sleeping pills, diuretics, Quaaludes...

36:24.783 --> 36:26.683
Valium, there you are.

36:27.252 --> 36:29.346
If I'm old enough to be on my own...

36:29.421 --> 36:31.753
then I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

36:31.823 --> 36:35.589
I do not wanna play the flute.
I do not wanna go to Juilliard.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.152
I do not wanna be paired off
with Franklin Potter.

36:38.229 --> 36:40.197
He is a lecherous jackass!

36:40.265 --> 36:44.168
And I never wanna hear
another string quartet again in my life!

36:51.910 --> 36:54.641
Now that we know what you don't want...

36:56.114 --> 36:58.048
what is it that you do?

37:00.285 --> 37:01.650
For now...

37:02.387 --> 37:05.948
I wanna win a Roller Boogie contest
down at the beach.

37:06.524 --> 37:10.324
A Roller Boogie contest?

37:21.840 --> 37:26.004
I'm sure that you'll accomplish
whatever you put your mind to.

37:26.111 --> 37:28.637
I mean, you always do.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.254
I have to meet your father for lunch...

37:39.324 --> 37:42.055
and we'll talk. We'll see.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.699
She didn't understand a thing I said.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.052
Hello?

39:55.827 --> 39:57.921
Lady, this is a pay phone.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.297
You want me to look where?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.425
All right, just a minute.

40:08.206 --> 40:11.267
- You Bobby James?
- Yeah.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.742
- It's for you.
- For me?

40:16.014 --> 40:18.108
He'll be here in a minute.

40:28.559 --> 40:29.549
Hello?

40:29.894 --> 40:33.194
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning, yourself. Who is this?</i>

40:33.364 --> 40:35.389
Terry Barkley. Remember me?

40:36.134 --> 40:38.933
Sure, I remember you. Why'd you run away?

40:39.537 --> 40:42.097
How'd that guy know
that was me in the window?

40:42.173 --> 40:43.607
I love your outfit.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.708
<i>Centerfold of Playgirl?</i>

40:46.911 --> 40:48.640
Come on, Terry, this is really weird.

40:48.713 --> 40:50.579
Blue shorts, how cute.

40:51.015 --> 40:53.416
Come on. Where are you?

40:54.285 --> 40:55.719
The parking lot.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.188
How about breakfast?

41:07.198 --> 41:08.393
<i>On me.</i>

41:09.334 --> 41:10.699
Sure.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.783
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

41:31.122 --> 41:35.025
- Like what?
- Like you're trying to read my mind.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.724
I wished I could.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.429
You're dealing with something heavy, right?

41:44.135 --> 41:47.196
It's all right. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.

41:47.939 --> 41:51.739
Yeah, like running away from home,
and running away from me.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.506
You're handling it just great.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.478
I'm sorry I slapped you and ran away.

41:59.417 --> 42:03.183
I was being a real bitch.
And you were handy.

42:07.759 --> 42:11.320
I'd still like you to teach me to skate.
Same price?

42:14.265 --> 42:16.063
$25 an hour.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.236
All right.

42:23.608 --> 42:24.666
$35.

42:26.477 --> 42:29.640
-$45.
- Sorry I asked.

42:30.782 --> 42:34.218
If I teach you to skate, it's because I want to.
You get it?

42:34.285 --> 42:37.311
I'll call the shots. Whatever I say, goes.

42:38.322 --> 42:40.814
I'm not interested in your money.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.657
- Deal?
- Deal.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.598
Lillian, where the hell are you?

42:49.667 --> 42:52.830
I'm a basket case,
and you're getting a touchup?

42:53.604 --> 42:55.470
All right, I'm sorry.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.909
Look, if she's still in Los Angeles,
we'll find her, okay?

43:02.613 --> 43:06.516
All right, now you just tip Mr. Upjohn,
or whoever's doing you...

43:06.651 --> 43:07.914
and come home.

43:12.190 --> 43:13.817
Lillian, I love her, too.

43:13.958 --> 43:16.620
What I want you to do is something like this.

43:17.128 --> 43:20.758
You know keep your arms like that,
then twist something like that.

43:21.065 --> 43:22.260
Okay, let's see.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.102
Okay, come on.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.271
Okay, now come out of it.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.971
That's good. That's real good.

43:34.045 --> 43:36.309
Come around here
and get both your hands here.

43:36.380 --> 43:39.543
Turn your body and twist it, okay?
Come straight down.

43:51.362 --> 43:52.852
One, two...

44:00.872 --> 44:02.636
One, two, three.

44:07.545 --> 44:08.808
I got an idea.

44:10.548 --> 44:12.175
Let's try another trick.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.513
- Ready?
- Yeah.

44:13.784 --> 44:15.479
One, two, three.

44:16.888 --> 44:19.380
Wait, I got it.

44:21.726 --> 44:23.455
Am I getting better?

44:24.262 --> 44:25.252
No.

44:31.102 --> 44:34.595
- That was good, Terry. All right.
- Wait! How do I stop?

44:37.775 --> 44:39.504
Okay, Terry, watch.

44:52.123 --> 44:53.716
You're looking good.

44:54.592 --> 44:56.856
You are. You look nice. Yeah, you do.

44:58.863 --> 45:01.696
- You planned that.
- I sure did.

45:12.977 --> 45:14.502
Let's call it quits.

46:06.063 --> 46:09.055
You know, things are beginning
to make a lot of sense.

46:09.800 --> 46:13.259
I can't explain it,
but I think you had a lot to do with it.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.901
You learn really fast.
How long have you been skating?

46:19.977 --> 46:22.173
- Three weeks.
- Come on, really?

46:22.246 --> 46:26.547
Really, I was an ice skater for years.
I won medals. Watch.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.985
I was only 6 years old.

46:34.859 --> 46:36.725
Come on, let's have some fun.

49:42.780 --> 49:45.681
- Let's Cunga!
- Cunga!

51:57.448 --> 52:00.440
Okay, my children,
J.D. is gonna take care of you once again.

52:00.517 --> 52:03.885
We have more music at Jammer's.
Are you ready?

52:22.840 --> 52:26.003
- What's happening, man?
- She lost her lock, man.

52:26.243 --> 52:29.269
Wait a minute.
I think I got some in here somewhere.

52:31.882 --> 52:34.681
Jammer's got some upstairs. Come up there.

52:54.538 --> 52:56.438
At great inconvenience...

52:57.541 --> 53:01.068
you force me
to make certain facts perfectly clear.

53:11.622 --> 53:14.114
Am I making myself perfectly clear?

53:25.269 --> 53:27.169
It's up here somewhere.

53:28.839 --> 53:30.933
This place is not for sale.

53:31.175 --> 53:34.839
We don't need
another shopping mall down here.

53:35.345 --> 53:38.212
You're the last merchant
to hold out, Delany.

53:38.282 --> 53:41.115
There's a lot of important money
at stake down here.

53:41.185 --> 53:43.244
That means big investors.

53:43.654 --> 53:46.282
You can't stop progress.

53:47.491 --> 53:49.391
Get out of my office.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.092
Something's going down in there.

53:59.737 --> 54:01.205
Some good advice:

54:01.972 --> 54:05.169
You take the money and run.

54:13.450 --> 54:17.353
Personally, I abhor violence.

54:19.156 --> 54:21.284
Anything can happen, Delany.

54:21.458 --> 54:24.450
Your insurance rating
is already in the danger zone.

54:25.129 --> 54:28.861
This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.

54:30.134 --> 54:32.626
One can never tell about accidents.

54:34.471 --> 54:38.499
Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.
Let's go.

55:14.745 --> 55:17.077
Oh, God, I've never been so scared.

55:17.281 --> 55:19.978
The piece that dude had
had gotta be 2 feet long.

55:20.050 --> 55:21.779
You guys, wait here.

55:25.289 --> 55:26.723
Come on, Jammer, open up!

55:36.767 --> 55:37.893
Damn!

55:42.172 --> 55:44.800
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm thinking.

55:46.243 --> 55:48.803
Why don't we find the others
and put our heads together?

55:48.879 --> 55:50.472
Let's go. Come on.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.079
- Have you guys seen Terry Barkley?
- Nope.

56:26.683 --> 56:30.278
So how you doing there, Twin Peaks?
Ready for some mountain climbing?

56:30.354 --> 56:34.257
Terry had a really bad scene at home,
and I think she might have run away.

56:34.324 --> 56:38.318
- Did you check the bus station?
- The bus station? Please.

56:42.599 --> 56:45.500
We'll just have to stroll along the beach
until she's found.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.901
Until she's safe in the arms
of her loved ones.

56:47.971 --> 56:50.668
We won't skate, we won't sleep,
we won't eat.

56:50.741 --> 56:53.438
- We won't eat?
- We won't eat.

56:55.646 --> 56:56.841
Onward!

57:10.928 --> 57:14.387
- Jammer, man, what's happening?
- Get out of the way.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.394
<i>Everybody out.</i>

57:19.736 --> 57:20.897
Jammer, you're drunk.

57:20.971 --> 57:25.772
<i>Damn it, didn't you hear me?
I said, everybody out! It's all over.</i>

57:26.376 --> 57:29.539
<i>I'm closing this place down for good.</i>

57:31.548 --> 57:34.074
- I'm sorry, kids.
- Wanna drink?

57:34.151 --> 57:35.880
I'm awful sorry.

57:47.264 --> 57:51.064
- All right, so where are they?
- I don't know. We've looked everywhere.

57:53.904 --> 57:55.998
Hey, C.C. What's going on, man?

57:56.139 --> 57:59.234
Jammer closed down the rink.
He's acting crazy.

57:59.443 --> 58:02.606
- Closed down the rink? What the hell for?
- I don't know.

58:06.249 --> 58:08.547
- Hey, listen, you guys
- Barkley!

58:08.752 --> 58:12.347
Look, where have you guys been?
And what's going on over at Jammer's?

58:12.422 --> 58:13.753
Here's the deal.

58:13.824 --> 58:16.919
We got two goons
and a twerpy guy with a $600 suit on.

58:16.994 --> 58:20.294
They want Jammer to sign the contract
or they'll torch the place.

58:20.364 --> 58:22.594
They don't even care if we're in there or not.

58:22.666 --> 58:24.361
<i>What about Sgt. Banner'?</i>

58:24.434 --> 58:27.369
He's always been straight
with the boardwalk scene, right?

58:27.437 --> 58:30.065
No cop's gonna arrest a guy
with a $600 suit on.

58:30.140 --> 58:33.838
Even if they did, there wouldn't be
enough rink left to fill a shoebox.

58:33.910 --> 58:37.403
- What about the Boogie Contest?
- Yeah, what about it?

58:40.417 --> 58:43.387
Jammer did it for us.
He did it so no one would get hurt.

58:43.453 --> 58:45.820
What Jammer needs is a good shyster.

58:45.889 --> 58:47.948
Barkley's father is a shyster.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.384
I mean, a lawyer.

58:50.861 --> 58:53.796
- Yeah, that's right, Terry.
- Come on, help us out.

58:56.900 --> 59:00.461
Wait, you don't know my father.
Look, I'm the runaway.

59:04.674 --> 59:05.869
Please?

59:12.949 --> 59:16.317
Okay, I'll do it. I'm in trouble anyway, right?

59:17.087 --> 59:18.577
- All right!
- Great.

59:19.956 --> 59:22.550
Captain? Yeah, this is Roger Barkley again.

59:22.626 --> 59:26.358
I know it's late,
but have you heard anything at all?

59:27.431 --> 59:28.796
I can't stand it anymore.

59:28.865 --> 59:32.699
Listen, she'll come along.
You know how kids are nowadays.

59:32.969 --> 59:35.165
She's just blowing off steam.

59:37.741 --> 59:39.800
Hi, remember me?

59:45.015 --> 59:46.449
Thank you.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.111
Now, before I turn you over to your father...

59:53.223 --> 59:55.555
is there anything you wanna tell me?

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.561
Pregnant?

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:06.535
- Mother, I've been gone overnight!
- How long does it take these days?

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:09.072
Ms. Barkley, I don't believe you!

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:16.111
All right, go on. Go see your father.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:24.921
All right, thank you.

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:28.755
Hi, Daddy.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.286
You finally remembered your address.

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:36.864
Daddy, I know it's not the right time,
but I need to talk to you.

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.300
I have been worried sick, young lady.

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:43.871
All this talk about nobody loving you.
It's the skating, isn't it?

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.206
It's that insane disco music thing.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:53.306
You're an artist, a musical genius.
And I'm not gonna have my daughter...

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.753
You do that again, I'll...

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:12.430
You get some sleep. Tomorrow's a big day.
Everybody will be there:

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:17.030
-the Music Society, the Philharmonic Club.
- I know, Daddy, but I need to ask a favor.

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.077
As long as it's not about skating
or disco music.

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.611
Lillian, shut up.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:25.241
Anything, sweetheart, you just name it.

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:29.513
I've got some friends
and they need some legal advice really bad.

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:32.054
Have them call me at the office on Monday.

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:35.319
Could they call tomorrow?
I won't ask for anything else after that.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:36.882
Why not invite them here?

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.419
I mean, I'm sure your father can talk to them
after the recital.

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:43.432
For once, Lillian, you're right. Okay.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.630
Honey, any friends of yours
are friends of mine, okay?

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.207
Sweet dreams.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.581
Look at these houses.

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:10.983
- Whoa, man! I wonder who lives there.
- I don't know. Probably some royal people.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:15.727
You guys,
behave yourselves at this party, okay?

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:17.631
Don't worry, I got class.

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:20.762
Yeah, and everything I know,
I learned from him.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:36.814
- British soldiers?
- This is valet parking, dummy.

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:39.820
Get that heap out of here.
Deliveries are around the back.

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:43.120
- How about I deliver you?
- Come on, Hoppy, cool it.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.290
Check your list for
"Robert James and friends."

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:54.099
Right through there.

01:02:56.873 --> 01:03:00.104
Yeah, and don't scratch the paint, my man.

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:11.621
- Your wrap, sir.
- Rap?

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:15.319
I got no time to rap, Chief.
Catch me later, okay?

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:24.795
Hey, look! A grass party.

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:29.031
- Cut it out.
- Don't hit him.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:32.166
Hey, cut it out! Act like you belong.

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:41.282
- Behave yourself.
- I'm well-behaved.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.890
- Do you care for an hors d'oeuvre?
- Don't mind if I do.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:59.830
- Finger sandwiches, my favorite food!
- Hey, get your own, lady!

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:03.997
Did you see what he did?

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.208
Give me one of those things.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.169
You guys, a little food?

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.809
- Look at this.
- Cafeteria.

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:15.476
- I can't find her.
- You will. She's around.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.719
Save some for somebody else, would you?

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.054
How nice of you to come.

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:31.833
Look what you made me do.
I lost my horse doovers.

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.130
Those are the guys.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.900
- What guys?
- The guys in the skating rink.

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:38.001
- Where?
- Over there.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.508
- Is Roger here?
- He's up with the musicians.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:45.310
He's a little nervous, but he'll be all right.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:48.249
I better get going. I'll see you later.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.584
Sunny, those kids at the table...

01:04:57.794 --> 01:05:00.491
they were at the roller rink the other day.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.395
Find out why they're here.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.795
Don't cause any trouble.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.801
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.868
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:20.849
Thank you for coming
to the final assembly...

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.409
of the Barkley Baroque Society.

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:28.486
This will be our last formal recital
for our daughter, Theresa.

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:32.923
She has been accepted
to the Juilliard School of Music...

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:34.521
as an Honor Student.

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:37.456
Gentlemen, would you take your seats?

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:43.336
Thank you.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.371
And now, without further ado...

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:49.037
the Barkley String Ensemble...

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:53.477
featuring flautist, Theresa Barkley.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.470
Wow, look at her, Phones.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.910
-Isn't she beautiful?
- Come on, man, let's go.

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:31.344
Excuse me. Sorry, lady.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.386
Excuse me.

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:37.552
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:43.965
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Get out of my lap!

01:06:49.072 --> 01:06:50.233
Jeez, HOPPY-

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.805
Breathe through your nose, Mother.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:07.156
Roger, do something!

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.861
- Roger, help me.
- Throw me a rope.

01:07:12.929 --> 01:07:14.624
- Throw me anything.
- Here.

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:20.904
Get your hand under her. Push up.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.496
Push her up, Franklin! Come on.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:33.945
Come on.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:38.052
Let's go! Over there.

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.687
Go around and cut them off.

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:49.824
Let me explain.

01:07:52.135 --> 01:07:53.466
I'm sorry.

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:05.311
Let's get out of here.

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:11.114
Bobby, come on!

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:34.407
Roger, do something.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:44.350
- Daddy, I--
- Roger, she was trying to tell you--

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.819
Lillian, shut up.

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:48.618
This lunacy. Those people in my home.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:51.854
It's my home, as well,
and you invited them here.

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:58.026
And Mr. Thatcher, our client-attorney
relationship nearly ruined...

01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:01.026
because of your incredible accusations.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:04.470
To say nothing of
a $10 million redevelopment investment...

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:08.374
now in jeopardy because of
my daughter's harebrained scheme...

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.173
to help all the unwashed in this world.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:16.612
You are never to see those people again.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:17.881
Did you hear that?

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:21.015
Daddy, I heard him
threaten to burn down the roller rink...

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.888
if Mr. Delany wouldn't sell.

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:24.791
My friends heard him, as well.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:28.161
Impossible to raise children
these days, Roger.

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:31.733
Young lady, I want an immediate apology
to Mr. Thatcher.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.133
What, you're gonna
take his word over mine?

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:38.197
This is not a game.
Now, Theresa, the apology. Right now.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:42.438
No! I'm not a child to be ordered
to apologize to a thief and a liar!

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:52.986
Lovey, wait!

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:11.004
Sorry, kid, I went to Jammer's myself.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.972
He's not pressing charges.

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:18.177
And the deal is legal.
He signed the contracts this afternoon.

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.877
Thanks, Danner.
It was really straight of you.

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:25.487
Yeah. Well, that's progress, kid.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:32.887
- At least Jammer will do okay.
- Yeah, that's for sure.

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:35.863
- Man, he copped out on us.
- What's one more sell-out?

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:38.060
- Shut up!
- Phones is out of a job.

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.603
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:42.362
None of you do.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.300
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I bet.

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:45.863
What's your problem, man?

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:48.240
You got to take a nap
in your little baby carriage?

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:51.337
Bobby, come on,
give us some slack, will you, man?

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:56.010
- Did you get a hold of Terry?
- Not even her maid would talk to me.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.217
Well, maybe it's for the best, man.

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:02.690
I mean, maybe she was too rich
for your blood, you know?

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.424
Who's that?

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.922
It's all over.

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:50.039
But you're gonna be the greatest, Bobby.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.308
The greatest.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:58.436
<i>I'd like to dedicate this next number
to Jammer Delany.</i>

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:50.434
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just thought you might come here.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:54.346
It's all over. Jammer signed the contract.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:00.987
You won't need to learn your moves
since there won't be a contest.

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:05.191
You can tell your father that I won't
be messing up his daughter's life anymore.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:10.332
What the hell! Can you imagine?
What a pair.

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:12.999
I love you.

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:41.824
<i>Dear Bobby, my parents have decided
to send me back East...</i>

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:44.889
<i>to stay with an aunt, before I start Juilliard.</i>

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:49.371
<i>Before I go, I had to tell you
that you're something really special.</i>

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:54.100
<i>I love you, Bobby James.
With all my heart, Terry.</i>

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:31.511
- Mr. <i>Thatcher?
- What is it?</i>

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.346
This is Nick.
I got the kid marked, down by the water.

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:36.407
<i>Stay with him.</i>

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:43.381
How's it going, Bob?

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.320
How you doing, Bobby?

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:54.695
- What's going on, man?
- Where's Phones?

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:59.274
I don't know. He gave Hoppy his noise
and said the world stinks. That's all I heard.

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.936
The guy's never gonna skate
or listen to boogie music ever again.

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:10.542
Oh, no, there he is!

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:18.153
Can you believe it?

01:18:19.762 --> 01:18:21.787
Crazy old Phones, man.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.591
The guy was always recording something
on this thing.

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:27.227
<i>There's a lot of important money
at stake down here.</i>

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:30.302
- Hey, wait a minute, what is this?
- Turn it up.

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:32.372
<i>Anything can happen, Delany.</i>

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:36.574
<i>Your insurance rating
is already in the danger zone.</i>

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:39.371
Do you believe that stuff?

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:41.508
<i>Might even be full of kids.</i>

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:45.018
<i>One can never tell about accidents.</i>

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:47.213
<i>Consider my offer.</i>

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:49.724
We got them! Damn, we really got them!

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:52.454
Phones left his tape player on
and didn't even know it.

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.053
Give me the tape.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.323
- What have we got?
- Evidence. We can kill the deal.

01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:02.493
But who's gonna believe us?
Those guys got all the money in the world.

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:05.506
Hoppy, give me the keys
to your old man's truck.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:08.509
Okay, man, but don't eat
any of those Puerto Rican guavas.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.409
Tell Phones to throw away the robe.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:13.676
Spread the word that the Boogie contest
is on tonight. Let's go.

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.150
- All right!
- Big Boogie's on, man!

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:31.890
Put me through to Thatcher. This is Sunny.

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:35.733
- I think we got some trouble on this end.
- It's time to <i>act.</i>

01:19:42.578 --> 01:19:46.742
God, I hate scenes like this.
Give me another tissue, Barkley.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.811
Barkley, you're so immature.

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:56.517
What are you gonna do without me
in New York?

01:19:57.259 --> 01:20:00.229
I'll call home
and ask for advice for the lovelorn.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.727
Give her a month in Manhattan,
she'll be giving you advice.

01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:10.165
What does he want?

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:13.805
Bobby, what are you doing here?

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:15.910
- Let's go.
- Shall I call the police?

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:17.605
No, Bobby, wait.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.581
I got all the evidence against Thatcher
on Phones' tape player.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.640
My parents will be here... What tape?

01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:25.619
I've had just about enough of you, fella.

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:29.448
- Come on, let's go. I'll tell you on the way.
- Let me out!

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:32.620
Wait a minute.
lam not leaving her alone for a moment.

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:36.461
Terry, come on. I'll get you for this, Bobby!
Let me out of here!

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:39.125
Terry, somebody, help me.

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:44.305
Help, Terry! Anybody, come on. Let me out!

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:46.098
Let me out of here!

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:55.049
- Come on, Jammer, don't split, man.
- We're not afraid of those guys.

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:58.417
- We can lick those dudes, man.
- Come on, Jammer, stay.

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:00.751
The tape can prove they threatened you.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.985
All we have to do
is get Sgt. Danner to listen.

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:07.324
- Yeah, man, it was corrosion!
- What he means is "coercion."

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:10.388
How will one more night hurt?
Then you can do what you want.

01:21:10.466 --> 01:21:13.595
Everybody's been practicing all year
to get ready for this thing.

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:16.730
Come on, Jammer,
just let us hold the contest tonight.

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.897
Listen to me, all of you.

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:23.809
If you think that I can live with the idea...

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:28.248
that one of you kids might get hurt
by a gang of money-hungry goons...

01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:31.646
then you're in for another think!
No, sir. Not me!

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.984
I can't stand that responsibility.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:37.721
I'm off to Arizona to watch the cactus grow.

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:39.987
That'll take forever.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:41.587
So long, gang-

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:44.867
I'm gonna miss you all. Take care of him.

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:48.460
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- So long, Jammer.

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:51.305
Don't drink on the road.

01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:09.722
Oh, God, I can't stand it.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:12.784
I can't stand
looking at your hound-dog faces.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.831
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:21.527
You can use the rink tonight
for one more time!

01:22:23.572 --> 01:22:26.337
One more time!

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:29.137
- Hey, Boss!
- Who's that?

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:30.838
There's Thatcher!

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:39.309
C.C., go to the Boardwalk,
find Danner, tell him to go to the rink, okay?

01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:41.789
Tell everybody
that the contest is on tonight.

01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:43.586
Okay, we'll meet you there.

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:46.287
When we get to them, spread out.
I want that tape.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:49.353
- Let's get the goons with the fruit!
- Get the fruit!

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.601
- Hold them up. See you at the rink.
- Good luck, man.

01:23:03.946 --> 01:23:05.914
Take off your skirt.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:14.721
Let's get out of here.

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:19.389
There goes the Barkley girl. Let's cut her off.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.145
- Now what?
- Take my hand and follow me.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.454
It's easy for you to say.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:49.890
You're headed for the Olympics.
I'm headed for broken bones.

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.448
Come on!

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:04.935
- Here they come!
- Come on, let's go!

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.740
Hurry UP!

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.568
Come on, move it, Sunny!

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:19.619
Just stay with them.

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.528
Watch out!

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.738
Head them off at the next street.

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.151
Jump it!

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:01.985
Get after them!

01:25:05.901 --> 01:25:07.995
- Down here!
- Down there?

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.332
Let's go.

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.023
Let's split up.

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:17.499
Watch it!

01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:23.106
All right, man. Give me five!

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.873
Hey, watch it, man!

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:51.530
- I think we lost them.
- Yeah, that's just great.

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:52.869
I don't know. I don't see them.

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.238
- See them?
- Nothing.

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:55.470
Come on.

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:57.305
Let's go.

01:26:58.113 --> 01:27:00.275
Hey, wait a minute. There they are!

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:42.090
Just wait a minute.

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:44.687
They probably skated back to the rink.

01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:46.386
Let's try there.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:56.435
Let's catch a free ride.

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:12.713
Get your head down. Don't let them see you.

01:28:24.533 --> 01:28:25.864
There they are.

01:28:41.516 --> 01:28:45.248
- I don't know where they are.
- Here they are! Right there.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.477
Are you all right?

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.853
- I got it.
- Hey, watch it.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.354
Freeze!

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.226
All right, Thatcher, all right now.

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:02.162
I'll make you a deal.

01:29:02.237 --> 01:29:04.467
You let the kids hold their contest...

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:07.565
and right after it the rink is all yours, okay?

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:09.940
Shut up, Delany.

01:29:11.947 --> 01:29:12.937
Chump!

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:20.648
- Give me the tape, kid.
- Give it to him, Bobby.

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:38.130
Thanks.

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:42.104
You want it? Come and get it.

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.539
Get the tape.

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.981
- Grab the gun!
- Keep them down.

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:02.994
What is this? Some new disco dance?

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:09.002
- Why don't you just play the tape?
- Play the tape!

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.300
All right, all right!

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.039
You listen to me.

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.508
Now, you listen to me good.

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:23.048
This is an infringement of my legal right,
and I want my lawyer.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.449
I want my lawyer now!

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.684
Mr. Thatcher, here I am.
Sorry it took me so long to get down here.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:31.248
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

01:30:32.027 --> 01:30:34.519
We'll discuss this later, young lady.

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:39.867
I want my client's immediate release
from this travesty of justice.

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:42.233
This is an illegal kangaroo court.

01:30:42.304 --> 01:30:46.036
It has no bearing or standard
in this contractual dispute.

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:48.040
Play the tape.

01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:52.112
Thatcher Industries is the sole owner
of this property.

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:55.611
All legal papers have been filed
and so noted.

01:30:55.684 --> 01:30:59.450
And everyone on these premises
is violating the trespass law.

01:30:59.521 --> 01:31:02.786
The deed has been registered and
recorded in and for the county of--

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:05.383
<i>There's a lot of important money
at stake down here.</i>

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.327
<i>Big money means big investors.</i>

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.794
Turn that off! That's inadmissible evidence!

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.857
<i>- Get out of my office.
Shut up.</i>

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:16.666
<i>Anything can happen, Delany.</i>

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:20.269
<i>Your insurance rating
is already in the danger zone.</i>

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:25.541
<i>This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.</i>

01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:30.174
<i>One can never tell about accidents.</i>

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:35.579
<i>Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.</i>

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.890
What the hell do I pay you for?
Say something.

01:31:42.564 --> 01:31:45.590
Well, I think that we have
a clear-cut case here, Mr. Thatcher.

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:47.328
No doubt about it.

01:31:49.204 --> 01:31:52.936
There's every indication that the contract...

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:56.367
between Mr. Delany
and Thatcher Industries is...

01:31:57.312 --> 01:32:01.806
in my professional opinion,
unequivocally and totally...

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:05.211
invalid.

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:28.308
<i>All right, children,
this is the time we've been waiting for:</i>

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:31.311
<i>the big Boogie contest!</i>

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:11.018
<i>Okay, that's it. No more calls.
We do have a winner.</i>

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.526
<i>Contestants, come forward, please.</i>

01:37:21.636 --> 01:37:24.298
<i>For being more than just the best dancers...</i>

01:37:24.372 --> 01:37:27.603
<i>for bringing inspiration
and the true spirit of music...</i>

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:30.303
<i>the Roller Boogie grand award goes to:</i>

01:37:30.745 --> 01:37:32.509
<i>Terry and Bobby.</i>

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.540
Bobby, Terry's coming, man.

01:38:36.978 --> 01:38:39.572
- You guys, let's split.
- Okay.

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.012
That time already?

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.912
I wanted you to have this.

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:25.825
My place is too small.
Why don't you keep it?

01:39:30.765 --> 01:39:33.097
There's no room in the suitcase.

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:45.770
Do you have my new address?

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:50.884
Yeah, I got it.

01:39:51.686 --> 01:39:53.245
You got mine?

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:59.418
It's in my flute case, so I'll see it all the time.

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:06.429
You're gonna be big, Bobby James.

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:10.132
I'll read about you in the papers someday:

01:40:10.438 --> 01:40:12.770
"Famous skater wins gold medal."

01:40:13.908 --> 01:40:17.742
Sure. Might even get to New York sometime.

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:20.204
You never know.

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.373
Never know.

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:21.898
Bye.
