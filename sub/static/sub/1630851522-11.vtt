that we were

cross-examine.

He told us
that Murtaugh confessed to him.

26:16.313 --> 26:19.055

to testify for you?

26:19.099 --> 26:21.188
Tough ask, considering
you're prosecuting him

26:21.231 --> 26:22.581

I can talk to my superiors

26:24.191 --> 26:26.367
about reducing the charges.

26:26.410 --> 26:29.022
But I assume, since your client
almost killed Mr. Murtaugh,

26:29.065 --> 26:30.589
that last thing he wants is
to see him walk.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.721

That can't happen.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.418

Tino to testify.

exactly that.

you and Carlos been dating?

Anything?

it was an accident.

to speak with Andre now.

it's easier for a child

isn't in the room.

his hand on me there.

Andre and I were talking about

about good touches

31:38.157 --> 31:40.507

- Mm-hmm.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.161
And you know the difference,
Andre?

31:42.204 --> 31:45.381

like a handshake.

31:47.209 --> 31:50.473
- And a hug?
- Good.

31:50.517 --> 31:53.346

in the bathroom?

31:53.389 --> 31:54.695

that before, Andre?

like it's enough.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.065
- So Annie's mom called

39:32.108 --> 39:34.372
and wanted to have
another playdate,

39:34.415 --> 39:36.591
and I said
that it would be better

39:36.635 --> 39:38.463
if she came to our house.

39:38.506 --> 39:41.379
- You didn't tell her it was
about Hudson and the dog cage.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.945
- Actually, I did.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.643
- Mom, I asked you not to.

39:44.686 --> 39:47.036
- Well...
- Hudson's just an idiot.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.908
No one likes him anyway.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.953
He bullies everyone.

39:50.997 --> 39:53.739
It was just my turn
to be his target.

39:53.782 --> 39:54.783
- Why?

39:54.827 --> 39:55.958
- I don't know.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.220
First, he went after Corey

39:57.264 --> 39:59.179
'cause Corey told everyone

39:59.222 --> 40:00.833
their pronouns are they/them,

40:00.876 --> 40:05.794
and Hudson started calling
Corey a fairy.

40:05.838 --> 40:10.451
So then I said that I was bi

40:10.495 --> 40:13.541
and that there's no shame
in being true to yourself.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.108
- That's right, Noah.

40:15.151 --> 40:17.937
So you stood up for Corey...

40:17.980 --> 40:20.113
and stood up for yourself.

40:20.156 --> 40:23.203
And that is incredibly brave.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.814
- Well, it's my truth.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.687
I just hadn't told anybody
before.

40:28.730 --> 40:32.430
- Well, thank you
for telling me.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.040
- No big deal.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.608
It's not like I have
a boyfriend or girlfriend.

40:36.651 --> 40:40.089
It's just not fair
for anybody to be left out.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.570
- I hear that.

40:42.614 --> 40:45.878
♪

40:45.921 --> 40:49.664
I'm really proud of you.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.187
- Okay.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.451
Anyway, could we go eat now?

40:53.494 --> 40:56.062
- [laughs] Yes.
