00:18.760 --> 00:21.127
Life's pretty simple, you know.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.650
It's long periods of waiting
broken up by brief moments of change.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.566
That's it. That's all it is.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.728
You see, here's my theory.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.609
The moments of change?

00:34.720 --> 00:37.326
They're what give your life its shape,

00:37.400 --> 00:38.686
its form.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.962
But it only takes one of them to define you

00:42.040 --> 00:44.805
and that'll be the only thing
you're remembered for,

00:44.880 --> 00:46.041
and you know it.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.407
In the instant it happens, you sense it,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.051
and the world is changed forever.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.088
You are forever changed.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.687
All right, kids. See you later, all right?

01:45.760 --> 01:47.524
- I love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.761
Kiss. See you later.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.524
- Love you, all right.
- Bye, Daddy.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.320
All right? See you later.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.640
Bye.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.002
All right, mate, look, I'm loading!
Look, I'm loading.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.842
Morning! Big fan, Mr. Harris!

03:11.440 --> 03:13.124
I don't believe in no fate.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.286
No karma, no coincidences,

03:16.360 --> 03:18.966
no conspiracy theories
or any of that other bullshit.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.164
Shit just happens.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.366
And life?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.326
That's just the shit that happens

03:25.400 --> 03:28.244
while you're wishing
you were someone or somewhere else.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.651
Who were you chatting to?

03:38.720 --> 03:41.041
No one, I was just on the phone.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.763
What are you doing out there?

03:45.440 --> 03:46.930
You ain't smoking again, are you?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.731
No, come on, Mom.
You know I'm off that now.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.245
It just gets a bit stuffy in my room.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.402
Getting a bit of fresh air.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.325
Ain't you forgetting something?

04:06.760 --> 04:07.807
Head's up me ass today.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.201
Here, I've even given them a clean and all.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.362
Thanks, darling,
I don't know what I'd do without you.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.720
Don't know why you wear your boots anyway.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.689
You only shout and moan on the sides.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.366
What? I'm teaching them the beautiful game.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.168
Anyway, I need my boots today
so I can run up and down

04:20.279 --> 04:21.565
handing out your sponsorship forms

04:21.640 --> 04:24.723
to them dads who are going to give you
loads of money for your charity.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.450
Look, never mind them.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.602
Just check if Ravi's heard any news.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.644
Yeah, I will. I will.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.563
Leave it with me.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.130
Bye, darling.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.087
Morning, gents! How are we all?

04:51.160 --> 04:52.969
You all right? How you doing, Hal?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.485
- Pretty good, mate. You?
- Good. Good to see ya.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.641
How are ya?

04:55.720 --> 04:58.121
Right, I've got a very, very
important announcement from the missus.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.329
She's doing a fun run for disabled kids.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.890
The fun part is going to be watching her

05:02.960 --> 05:05.122
and her lumpy pals
run around Battersea for an hour.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.810
But...

05:06.880 --> 05:08.405
Could you do what you can for her?

05:08.480 --> 05:10.209
- Okay.
- Yeah? Thanks very much, guys.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.805
Cheers. Cheers.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.408
All right, Ravi? Any news, mate?

05:17.480 --> 05:20.768
- Don't worry. All the references are sorted.
- Right.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.609
Exciting times, huh?

05:23.640 --> 05:25.642
That's fantastic. Thank you, mate.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.330
- Thank you so much.
- Not a problem, mate.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.084
Yeah, she's going to be well chuffed.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.811
It means a lot to us. Thank you, Rav.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.406
Right, lads! Over here, please!

05:38.520 --> 05:39.851
Are you okay?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.888
Yeah. Why?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.046
You just seem a little bit distracted.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.451
I'm okay.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.924
I just wish I didn't have to sneak around,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.604
be so secretive.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.165
He's the one that was screwing the nanny.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.367
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

06:00.440 --> 06:02.124
It's all right. I just...

06:02.960 --> 06:05.531
I don't really need you to remind me.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.606
Sorry, excuse me. I'm just gonna...

06:14.040 --> 06:15.690
I'm just gonna...

06:20.160 --> 06:21.286
So...

06:24.120 --> 06:26.202
I found this the other day.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.043
Oh, my God.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.046
Do you remember that night?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.242
That's the first night I met you.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.731
- Yes, it was.
- It was.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.848
And you haven't changed a bit.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.331
Yeah, right.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.484
Shame it's 10 years and two kids later.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.447
Well, have you thought
about getting back into it?

06:47.520 --> 06:49.443
Acting?

06:49.520 --> 06:51.966
- No.
- Why not?

06:52.040 --> 06:54.008
I wouldn't know how to go about it.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.924
There's got to be someone that you can call,

06:57.000 --> 06:58.604
point you in the right direction.

06:58.680 --> 07:03.083
And I can take some new headshots for you,

07:03.160 --> 07:07.609
get a couple of, like, really moody, 10x8s,

07:07.680 --> 07:09.444
really actory ones.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.285
- Hey. Kids get off okay?
- Yes, all good.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.885
Evie took ages to get off, though.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.884
- I'll go and check on her.
- Listen, Emily...

07:46.720 --> 07:48.051
You're supposed to call first.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.761
I did, but you were obviously busy, so...

07:52.440 --> 07:53.487
What do you want?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.724
Well, a signed shirt from the loft
and kiss our children,

07:56.800 --> 07:57.847
is that all right?

07:58.680 --> 08:00.045
Off you go then. Your audience awaits.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.411
- Don't you fancy it?
- No.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.445
Goodbye, Max.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.643
Good evening again, ladies and gents.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.164
A bit of quiet please,

08:36.280 --> 08:39.727
because it's time
to meet the man of the moment.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.370
Please welcome to the stage our host,

08:41.840 --> 08:45.162
former England rugby captain, a true hero,

08:45.240 --> 08:49.040
and our very own gladiator, Maximus Moore.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.010
Thank you, Dan.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.007
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.162
As my grandmother once said,

09:03.240 --> 09:06.722
"It's always good
to have a warm hand on your opening."

09:09.720 --> 09:12.803
In all seriousness, thank you so much
for supporting our foundation.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.407
You know,
our aim is to raise even more money

09:16.480 --> 09:19.927
and encourage those less fortunate
than ourselves to play rugby

09:20.000 --> 09:22.731
and perhaps learn
the disciplines of working on a team.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.804
So, sit back and we'll run the VT

09:25.880 --> 09:28.281
of some of our fantastic work
that we've been doing. Cheers.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.531
- Say cheese.
- Cheese!

09:45.200 --> 09:46.725
- Nice one.
- Thanks, girls.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.767
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.966
- See you.
- Later.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.403
- Bye, Max. See you.
- Yeah.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.761
Are you sure?

09:54.840 --> 09:56.649
Mate, I ain't getting any at home, am I?

09:57.520 --> 10:00.046
You think she's still seeing
that photographer bloke?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.685
Cunt.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.285
So, what are you gonna do?

10:03.360 --> 10:06.284
Well, I'll see how she likes it
when her credit card gets stopped, yeah?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.010
- Seriously?
- Yeah, mate.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.321
Listen, call your mate
and get him to grab some gear.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.880
Yeah. And I'll sort those two out.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.362
Sorry, I don't think
that picture came out really well.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.563
- It's dead in here, B.
- Fam, this action's shit!

10:36.800 --> 10:38.484
Hey, yo, let's go hit VIP.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.641
What?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.642
Mate, do you think we can get in?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.802
Watch. Let me deal with this, you know?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.166
- Yeah.
- Come.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.004
Say no more.

10:49.720 --> 10:50.767
Wah gwan?

10:51.760 --> 10:52.921
You got a stamp?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.524
Hey, look, yeah?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.209
I don't think so.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.805
This ain't for your type, little man.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.121
We've been invited, mate.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.043
We're on a table. Trust me.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.610
I don't think so.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.165
And you stink of weed.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.322
So, you need to leave the club now.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.807
Hey, come on, brother.
Where's your empathy?

11:13.880 --> 11:17.441
I don't know you, and you ain't my brother.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.843
- So step aside...
- Yeah, we don't wanna fucking know you!

11:21.720 --> 11:23.609
Mandingo fucking prick!

11:26.480 --> 11:29.404
Fucking dickhead! Fuck you, man!

11:29.480 --> 11:31.005
Idiots!

11:35.360 --> 11:36.691
Fucking wanker!

11:36.800 --> 11:37.801
Shit!

11:37.880 --> 11:39.120
Come here!

11:39.760 --> 11:40.966
Get the fuck off me, man!

11:42.720 --> 11:44.529
Get the fuck off him!

11:44.640 --> 11:47.120
Hey! Leave him! Leave him the fuck alone!

11:47.560 --> 11:49.050
Get the fuck off me.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.367
Get the fuck off me.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.207
Get off me!

12:03.520 --> 12:04.885
Get off me!

12:06.680 --> 12:09.206
Get the fuck off me!

13:30.760 --> 13:33.286
Look what the cat's dragged in, eh?

13:33.840 --> 13:35.001
What've you done to your face?

13:35.080 --> 13:38.209
Mom, Mom, it's nothing. Just slipped.
Had a couple of drinks n' that.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.203
- Who was you with?
- My boy Sean, innit?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.645
Well, that boy's got brains.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.001
I bet he didn't get himself
into such a condition.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.765
That's going to look great in job interviews.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.251
Mom, it's fine. Trust me.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.050
Just make sure
you get Amelia to church on time.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.604
What do you say, shorty. You ready, yeah?

13:57.680 --> 13:59.011
You smell.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.645
"Immediate return to court order..."

14:02.720 --> 14:05.087
Hey! That's none of your business.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.923
- You going back to prison?
- What?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.889
No. Of course not.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.724
Look, I'll just take
a pregnant white chick to court

14:12.800 --> 14:14.370
and they'll give me community service.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.167
Hey.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.170
I ain't ever going back there, you know?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.765
I promise you.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.726
Now, come on.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.804
Let's go before we both get in trouble, yeah?

14:39.440 --> 14:43.206
"Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia..."

14:43.280 --> 14:46.727
"The Gods themselves throw incense."

14:48.640 --> 14:52.201
Must be, what,
four years since we did Lear together?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.371
Eight years ago.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.563
That's the price you pay
for those thunderous thighs

15:00.640 --> 15:02.290
and the glamorous life of a WAG.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.006
How is Mr. Neanderthal?

15:07.520 --> 15:09.284
Being a royal pain.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.251
Yes, that's why you're here, I suppose?

15:11.320 --> 15:12.560
You miss me.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.762
You've finally succumbed to my...

15:14.840 --> 15:17.446
My mature charm.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.009
Something like that.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.684
It's not easy with a family, I'm sure,

15:25.720 --> 15:28.166
but we make our choices.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.449
Yeah, but it'll be good
for me to be working again.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.249
For everyone, you know?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.448
Keep me off the happy pills.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.850
We're all the same, you know.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.051
Without our passion,

15:42.120 --> 15:45.602
it's very hard for us
to find our place in the world.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.288
That aimed at him or me?

15:50.720 --> 15:52.927
Now, I'm delighted I can help.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.080
I always hoped you'd be back.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.650
Consider it done.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.488
Don't worry about it. It'll be all right.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.289
Fingers crossed, eh?

16:03.040 --> 16:06.567
Otherwise it'll be more
than a fucking broomstick she shoves up me.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.490
I'm really sorry, madam,
but the system's saying, "Card declined."

16:13.560 --> 16:15.722
Leo, give me my phone. Give me...

16:18.760 --> 16:20.683
Sorry. Thanks.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.040
For fuck's sake, Max,
I couldn't even get a present

16:28.120 --> 16:29.884
for the kid's birthday party.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.405
You said you'd set up the account.

16:31.480 --> 16:34.211
You said you'd transferred my allowance!

16:34.280 --> 16:35.725
Stop trying to control me!

16:37.200 --> 16:38.884
Hold my hand, Leo.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.170
Hi. Come in.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.810
- How are you?
- Not too bad. Yourself?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.769
- Very well.
- Good, good.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.641
I know you've both done good work
in the preparation group classes

16:55.720 --> 16:58.690
and it's been a long six months,
but we're nearly there now.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.730
I don't know why you don't just make us wait

17:01.800 --> 17:04.201
the full nine like the real thing.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.566
Our assessment's all but done,

17:05.640 --> 17:08.530
and Dr. Ravi Buttar's reference
was first-class.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.089
He really respects you, George.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.609
I should play his son up-front every week.

17:16.280 --> 17:20.968
One minor issue has reared its ugly head,
though, I'm afraid, guys.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.483
A couple of arrests in your teens, George.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.848
Football hooliganism?

17:27.160 --> 17:29.640
You assured us of full disclosure.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.721
That was years ago. I mean, I was only a kid.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.406
Youthful exuberance, I think they called it.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.002
Common assault and disturbing the peace

17:44.080 --> 17:46.367
can be seen by some
as more than a misspent youth, George.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.844
No, I mean, literally, it was 30 years ago.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.042
West Ham ain't won a trophy since.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.404
I think what my better half is trying to say
is that having played up a bit in his teens,

17:56.480 --> 17:59.324
he will be experienced enough
to make sure that our kid knows the pitfalls

17:59.400 --> 18:00.970
of hanging out with wrong 'uns.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.486
Yeah, and I've met plenty of wrong 'uns.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.522
To be honest,
we're both so nervous today, and...

18:10.880 --> 18:13.042
All we want is what everyone else has

18:13.120 --> 18:17.364
and to give all the love we have to a baby
who deserves and needs it.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.806
We just want to be given a chance.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.605
That's all.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.290
Kathy.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.441
Kath!

18:53.680 --> 18:54.920
Hi, Jake.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.045
Yeah, yeah.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.010
Actually, I thought about
what you said the other day

19:01.080 --> 19:04.209
and guess who I had lunch with today?

19:05.560 --> 19:08.166
My actor friend, Terence Harris.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.567
No, no, not like that.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.927
- But he did say that he'd help me...
- Daddy's here!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.490
- My kids are here!
- Daddy! Daddy!

19:14.560 --> 19:16.927
Can I call you back? I'll tell you later.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.650
In about an hour? Yeah.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.089
Mommy, look what Daddy bought us!

19:23.160 --> 19:24.685
Wow, that's great!

19:24.760 --> 19:26.205
Why don't you open them outside?

19:26.280 --> 19:28.567
Because Mommy needs
to talk to Daddy in private.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.404
Well, that makes a change.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.488
Go on, I'll be in there
in a second, all right?

19:32.560 --> 19:34.130
Okay, okay.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.521
You might be able
to manipulate your groupies

19:36.640 --> 19:39.371
and your so-called mates,
and even your own kids,

19:39.440 --> 19:40.521
but not me, Max,

19:40.600 --> 19:42.125
not since you shat on your own doorstep.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.049
What is going on,
that's why I gave you your own space...

19:44.160 --> 19:45.650
Look, I haven't finished!

19:47.120 --> 19:50.124
How dare you humiliate me like that
in front of my own kids?

19:50.200 --> 19:51.486
Like what? What are you talking about?

19:51.560 --> 19:53.881
- Like what? Is this about the money?
- Of course it's about the money.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.440
All right, okay, fine, you know,
I lost my credit card, okay?

19:56.520 --> 19:57.965
And they put a block on it.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.690
And I realized that you might come up short,

19:59.800 --> 20:03.247
so I went to the bank
and got you some cash. Here you go.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.964
That's why I came round today,
to make sure you and the kids were okay.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.562
Em, come on,
you didn't think I would just, like,

20:18.640 --> 20:20.768
leave you hanging, did you?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.609
You did, didn't you?

20:29.600 --> 20:31.489
Right, you lot! Where are you?

20:32.400 --> 20:35.244
Where are you?
What you doing here, hiding?

20:38.480 --> 20:40.164
You know what my life's about right now?

20:40.800 --> 20:43.087
It's all about the blocks,

20:43.160 --> 20:46.801
dirty great towers
that have stood firm for two generations,

20:46.880 --> 20:50.441
full of initiated kids
who'll be dead before they grow old.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.040
Grim towers and hopeless kids.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.562
"For the first 10 days
they sailed on beautifully

21:17.640 --> 21:21.361
"and found plenty to eat,
as there was lots of fish.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.966
"And they had only
to take them out of the sea

21:25.040 --> 21:29.250
"with a long spoon
when the quangle wangle..."

21:29.680 --> 21:31.170
What's a quangle wangle?

21:47.520 --> 21:50.171
God, I miss putting those kids to bed.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.606
And sleeping next to you, of course.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.011
We gonna go to the Chelsea Ball next week?

22:06.080 --> 22:07.081
No.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.321
Come on...

22:11.400 --> 22:15.405
Do you actually ever stop
to think about why I hate those events?

22:16.240 --> 22:18.163
They worship you and...

22:18.760 --> 22:20.330
Don't even notice me.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.922
Well, it is those events that pay the bills.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.286
This is new.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.486
Look at you, man.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.209
What's this about?

22:34.280 --> 22:36.044
That must have been the cleaner, I think.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.964
We've been having a bit of sort out.
It wasn't on purpose.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.121
Ems...

22:46.880 --> 22:48.609
I made a mistake.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.290
You made more than one.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.045
I know I did. I know.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.966
And I'm truly sorry about it. Okay?

22:56.040 --> 22:57.849
But how long do we have
to keep on going like this?

22:57.920 --> 22:59.763
- It's killing me...
- It's not a game.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.411
And I'm sure you are sorry,
but I'm not ready.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.130
I need more time.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.811
It's not all about you.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.325
As long as the credit cards work,
though, right?

23:07.400 --> 23:09.129
It's about our kids.

23:10.960 --> 23:14.362
And I'm gonna be working soon.
So, I'll have my own money.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.522
I didn't mean that, like...

23:17.040 --> 23:19.771
I'm sorry about that. I don't mean that.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.165
Ems, look, I...

23:28.440 --> 23:30.124
I stopped playing.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.964
I lost my parents.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.126
And I'm really turned round.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.851
All I really had left
was you and my kids, okay?

23:38.640 --> 23:40.165
And I miss you.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.321
Ems, I'm sorry.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.843
I just want you back.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.766
Ta.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.686
Here, sweetheart.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.405
- Cheers, George.
- Thank you. Cheers.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.606
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.762
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you please welcome

24:06.880 --> 24:09.121
Battersea's favorite singing cabbie, George!

24:09.440 --> 24:10.965
Go on, George!

24:17.320 --> 24:18.560
Good evening, Wembley!

24:25.800 --> 24:28.565
No matter where I roam

24:30.720 --> 24:34.850
I will return to my English rose

24:34.920 --> 24:36.729
For no bonds

24:37.320 --> 24:40.722
Can ever keep me from she

24:45.120 --> 24:48.010
I've sailed the seven seas

24:49.920 --> 24:52.491
I've flown the whole blue sky

24:54.680 --> 24:57.809
But I return with haste

24:59.240 --> 25:01.925
To where my love does lie

25:04.200 --> 25:06.601
No matter where I go

25:08.680 --> 25:12.651
I will come back to my English rose

25:12.720 --> 25:15.121
For no one

25:15.280 --> 25:18.363
Can ever tempt me from she...

25:23.120 --> 25:25.122
I've searched the secret mists

25:27.600 --> 25:30.365
I've climbed the highest peaks

25:32.440 --> 25:35.284
I've caught the wild wind home

25:36.960 --> 25:39.486
To hear her soft voice speak

25:41.640 --> 25:44.484
No matter where I roam

25:46.480 --> 25:50.530
I will return to my English rose

25:50.640 --> 25:52.881
For no bonds

25:52.960 --> 25:56.043
Can ever keep me from she

26:00.680 --> 26:03.809
I've been to ancient worlds

26:05.320 --> 26:08.244
I've scoured the whole universe

26:10.000 --> 26:13.243
And caught the first train home

26:14.960 --> 26:17.440
To be at her side

26:20.000 --> 26:22.731
No matter where I roam

26:24.040 --> 26:28.204
I will return to my English rose

26:28.280 --> 26:30.044
For no one

26:30.680 --> 26:32.011
No nothing

26:33.320 --> 26:38.008
No bonds can ever keep me

26:38.080 --> 26:40.048
From she

26:58.600 --> 27:00.125
You all right?

27:01.480 --> 27:03.369
I think you should go.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.889
It was a mistake.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.201
You've got what you came for,
and my money's on the counter.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.964
Stop it. Come on. Let's just talk.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.804
If we could talk,

27:13.880 --> 27:16.201
we wouldn't be where we are now.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.961
You just treat everything like
it's a match you can't lose.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.566
Please... Please, Max, will you go?

27:23.880 --> 27:25.245
A mistake?

28:05.880 --> 28:08.326
Darling? Cup of tea for you there.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.250
Good luck today, all right?

28:14.320 --> 28:16.641
I got money on you winning this.

28:17.080 --> 28:20.368
Thanks, love, but I keep telling you,
it ain't a bloody race.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.329
No. Of course it ain't.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.050
See you later.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.485
And don't you be late.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.040
I won't.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.890
- Excuse me.
- Hold this, yeah?

28:56.200 --> 28:57.565
Dom, what the fuck is wrong with you?

28:57.640 --> 28:59.722
- Get off the man's car!
- Thanks. Thank you.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.127
You fucking idiot. Man, how stupid are you?

29:02.400 --> 29:05.210
- Come on, man.
- Bruv, when are you going to grow up?

29:05.280 --> 29:06.691
How many times have I told you?

29:06.760 --> 29:09.765
You're supposed to be selling this,
not smoking it, you little prick.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.165
Where the fuck is your ped?

29:13.680 --> 29:16.490
That's... That's all I could tief, innit?

29:19.240 --> 29:20.526
You're some dickhead, you know.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.443
Man, this is why you don't get no chicks.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.568
What? Bruv, you know I got bare girls.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.051
Man, I got my dick sucked last night.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.889
- What do you know?
- Please.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.246
I swear down, bruv.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.446
She sucked me off.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.602
She asked
why I didn't have no hair down there.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.286
Told her I had alopecia. Spot me.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.691
Fucking...

29:37.520 --> 29:39.329
- Idiot.
- Alopecia.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.569
Yo, make sure
you don't get the bag this time.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.091
Where the fuck these freshman at?

29:49.400 --> 29:51.084
Been waiting for this shit all day, cuz.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.245
My young Gs.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.210
Tonight's the night.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.880
It's initiation time.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.649
So, you best grab them peds
and ride 'em for real.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.051
Wait till some cunt flashes you up, yeah?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.762
Then you fuck him up! You get me?

30:10.960 --> 30:12.405
Something wrong, Kingsley?

30:12.480 --> 30:13.766
Seriously?

30:13.840 --> 30:16.127
Man, why are we still troubling them
that ain't on nothing?

30:16.200 --> 30:17.565
It's about trust and loyalty, innit?

30:18.240 --> 30:20.004
And don't be thinking
I don't need no proof, you know.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.764
That's why God invented the iPhone.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.686
Come on then!

30:31.360 --> 30:32.885
You still don't fucking get it, do you?

30:33.080 --> 30:35.526
We need the young 'uns
out on the road making dough,

30:35.600 --> 30:38.251
not getting bagged for some dead crime.

30:40.080 --> 30:43.084
Ain't you got somewhere
you're supposed to be?

30:48.760 --> 30:51.684
I don't care how tough you think you are
or what you've done to get here

30:52.440 --> 30:53.771
or what you do when you're not here.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.924
You're here to work.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.289
Don't worry, love.
I'm on me way. You crack on.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.131
Excuse me?

31:12.760 --> 31:15.127
- Mate, sorry. I'm done for the day.
- Your light's on.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.328
I only live over the bridge.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.088
Go on then, mate. Jump in.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.801
- Where you going?
- Halsey Street, please.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.451
Excuse me?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.368
Would you mind giving me a hand?

31:47.800 --> 31:49.928
- What?
- Hand.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.968
You've got a pair of them
at the end of your arms.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.328
You're supposed to be
paying back your community, aren't you?

31:59.520 --> 32:00.601
Okay.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.001
There you are.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.170
While you're here,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.210
some mulch would be most useful.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.080
- What's...
- Mulch.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.286
Bark mulching.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.170
You've got a mountain of it beside your hut.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.929
I'll make it worth your while.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.162
Look, man, I'm... I'm done for the day.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.605
I'm literally about to roll out.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.530
You look tired.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.326
You okay?

32:35.400 --> 32:36.970
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:37.800 --> 32:38.881
Yeah?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.205
All right, look.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.250
I've got something that should cheer you up.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.164
Marrakech?

32:56.240 --> 32:57.969
Imagine it, the two of us,

32:58.080 --> 32:59.684
we'll actually be rocking the Casbah.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.444
- Listen, Jake, I can't.
- Only for two nights.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.761
I can't just bugger off on a whim.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.571
- I'm not a student anymore.
- It's two nights.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.847
The kids have got stuff on. I've got work on.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.684
And... And I've got to think about Max.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.370
Max!

33:12.440 --> 33:14.681
Max. Why's it always about Max?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.683
Emily, he's fucked you over.
Why can't you see that?

33:16.760 --> 33:17.807
Don't be like that, Jake.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.210
It's not a competition between you two.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.011
I really don't need this at the moment.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.409
It was a nice thought, though.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.285
Good man.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.284
You moved quicker
than you have done all afternoon.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.407
Here's a thank you for your kindness.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.609
No, no, man. It's cool.
I don't want your money.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.123
A good deed brightens a dark world.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.368
So, would you like me
to do anything else for you while I'm here?

33:57.440 --> 34:01.248
Two curses of the modern world,
sarcasm and the empty gesture.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.685
No, you're all done for today.

34:04.760 --> 34:05.841
Save your next job for tomorrow.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.810
We pay all the taxes
and we're the bloody pariahs.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.281
There are jobs. People don't want to work.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.960
You know, if it wasn't for people like me,

34:20.040 --> 34:22.121
this country would be totally fucked.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.290
Big night out, was it?

34:25.040 --> 34:26.485
Fucking hell!

34:32.159 --> 34:33.650
What the fuck?

34:35.280 --> 34:37.043
Love, you all right?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.728
Love? You all right?

34:39.800 --> 34:42.406
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.121
Darling, you okay? Darling? Love?

34:49.960 --> 34:51.928
You seen, mate.
She just stepped out in front of me.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.731
I... Have you got a phone?
Ring an ambulance.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.167
Anyone know first aid?
I... I don't know what to do.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.248
I don't know what to do.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.530
Can you hear me?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.287
What you are doing here today
by giving up your time

35:12.360 --> 35:14.203
and raising sponsorship money

35:14.280 --> 35:17.363
will make a lot
of children's lives so much better.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.723
So, thank you so much for doing this.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.490
I hope you have a great day.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.642
And off you go, on the three.

35:23.960 --> 35:26.361
One, two, three!

35:40.560 --> 35:42.961
I was sitting in the back seat...

36:24.880 --> 36:27.360
Where the hell are you? I did it.

36:27.440 --> 36:30.728
Now, get your slippery,
fat ass here and take me home.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.963
Well, we might as well
have a quick drink first.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.570
Hey, we did it, yeah!

37:42.160 --> 37:44.288
Kingsley. I went by the graveyard, fam.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.850
Boss man said you'd left, though, innit.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.287
How's it picking up
them weeds, though, fam?

37:48.360 --> 37:50.761
Must be long still. Oi, you tell Jules yet?

37:50.840 --> 37:52.205
Nah, man, that's my business.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.123
That don't affect big man's business.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.282
Yeah, I know, but he's mad para, innit?

37:56.360 --> 37:59.125
About feds and snitching, fam.
Need to fix up...

37:59.200 --> 38:00.725
Why the fuck you always setting shit?

38:00.840 --> 38:03.047
Jules knows I'm the one
that brings in the piece.

38:03.120 --> 38:06.124
You're just the muscle.
Some innie knucklehead.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.283
And to think
you used to be someone to me, man.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.644
You know,
there's more to life than the blocks

38:15.720 --> 38:16.881
and messing with the youngers.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.045
Hey...

39:19.520 --> 39:22.046
You're embarrassing me!
You're embarrassing me!

39:22.120 --> 39:23.406
Let's go.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.844
All right, Granddad?

39:55.480 --> 39:56.766
No, no...

40:00.600 --> 40:02.284
Hey, we're just having a laugh.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.761
In we go, Max, that's where we go. In we go.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.330
That's it.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.561
Mom!

40:41.680 --> 40:43.284
- Just give me your keys.
- What?

40:43.360 --> 40:44.407
Mom, what you being like this for?

40:45.880 --> 40:47.370
- Mom!
- I found it.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.363
- Give me your keys.
- Hey, Mom, Mom, calm down.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.523
- Let me explain.
- Keys, now!

40:52.600 --> 40:53.886
Wait, listen to me, Mom.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.526
Mom!

41:03.320 --> 41:04.560
Mom.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.606
Fuck.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.044
All right, thank you. Thank you, gentlemen.

41:18.040 --> 41:22.364
And here, listen, yeah... Here, look...

41:23.240 --> 41:26.449
I will... I will sort you out, all right?

41:26.520 --> 41:28.170
Here's my business card.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.163
I will make sure...

41:31.880 --> 41:33.928
Let's get rid of that.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.480
Look, but no. Tickets, eh?

41:36.560 --> 41:37.721
You know I'll sort you out.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.246
So, there you go. Thank you.

41:40.320 --> 41:44.211
Max, you were a legend, mate.
Sort yourself out.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.005
Yeah, well...

41:51.480 --> 41:54.086
I can't be a legend

41:54.160 --> 41:56.208
because I'm not dead yet.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.286
Go on. Go to bed.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.841
Hiya.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.002
Hey. It's me.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.326
Oh, fuck.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.080
What's going on?

43:43.360 --> 43:46.250
I gotta go, all right? I'll call you later.

43:59.120 --> 44:00.246
Shit.

44:47.720 --> 44:48.801
Was this your pops?

44:50.120 --> 44:51.690
Oh, no, no. No, it was an old friend.

44:51.760 --> 44:53.649
You could call him my mentor.

44:56.480 --> 44:59.444
There's nothing I'm doing right now that
I'd even want to put on there, you know.

45:02.400 --> 45:06.450
Well, keep in mind
that all our lives amount to

45:06.520 --> 45:10.525
is that little dash on your headstone

45:11.680 --> 45:14.126
between the date of your birth
and your death.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.923
That stands for everything we ever were.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.846
Well, that was
a full-blooded 40 minutes, wasn't it?

46:21.920 --> 46:24.764
Max, as a former international captain,
you must have just loved it.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.284
I thought that the...

46:28.320 --> 46:30.800
Very entertaining first half, you know?

46:30.880 --> 46:33.201
The... Both packs...

46:34.040 --> 46:35.371
Dominant.

46:35.480 --> 46:36.970
And...

46:40.200 --> 46:42.328
Okay, we'll come back to you in just a sec.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.526
Kyran, what were your thoughts?

46:54.600 --> 46:57.604
Yeah, it was very entertaining.
The first minute, the try...

46:57.680 --> 47:00.411
Probably the quickest try
in international rugby we've ever seen.

47:00.480 --> 47:04.326
So as Max has said, just got to make sure
that we keep the tempers down.

47:04.400 --> 47:05.606
I think the referee's doing a good job.

47:05.680 --> 47:08.331
The yellow card is probably
the right thing to keep it calm.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.562
- Huge audience watching. It's not just...
- Yeah.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.250
What the fuck you doing, Max?

47:12.320 --> 47:14.687
You need to take a good look
in the mirror, seriously

47:14.760 --> 47:17.491
Do you know how many people
were watching this?

47:17.560 --> 47:19.085
Millions, that's how many.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.766
Jerome. Mate, listen...

47:21.840 --> 47:24.571
No, just go home and call me
when you're compos mentis, okay?

47:48.280 --> 47:50.169
It ain't some big conspiracy,

47:50.240 --> 47:51.969
and it ain't no cover-up.

47:52.040 --> 47:55.044
Shit just happens,
and you just gotta accept that.

47:55.120 --> 47:58.124
They say everyone's equal
in the eyes of the law,

47:58.200 --> 48:00.851
but that don't mean
the law treats everyone equally.

48:01.120 --> 48:04.567
Injustice, natural disasters, 9/11,
the war on terror.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.723
Shit just happens, man.

48:09.960 --> 48:12.930
Yeah, I... I mean, like,
it's not a poem or a rap or anything.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.684
It's... I just got
some shit to say, you know?

48:14.760 --> 48:16.967
Well, whatever it is,

48:17.080 --> 48:18.411
it's spoken like a true professional.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.244
Yeah, well, I've been writing.

48:21.600 --> 48:24.126
Them headphones are hard, you know?

48:24.720 --> 48:26.609
- Better than mine, at least.
- Well...

48:26.680 --> 48:27.681
What are you listening to?

48:28.440 --> 48:29.930
Here you are.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.324
Hey, what?

48:34.400 --> 48:36.721
Nina Simone, yeah? All right.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.410
This is my mom's kind of shit, you know.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.083
"Please don't let be misunderstood."

48:42.160 --> 48:43.685
Written for her in 1964.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.491
I was 10.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.362
I say what you need is a room of one's own,

48:53.080 --> 48:56.641
somewhere to write,
somewhere where you can be inspired.

48:58.520 --> 49:01.171
I think it's high time
you joined me on the beach.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.130
Hey, it's me.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.529
I just called to check you're okay

49:52.600 --> 49:55.729
and say sorry
I was a bit harsh the other night.

49:56.040 --> 49:58.088
Oh, yeah, and Evie wanted to say hi.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.844
- Go on.
- Hi, Daddy,

49:59.920 --> 50:02.287
Where are you? I miss you, Daddy,

50:02.360 --> 50:04.727
And Leo's being a real pain.

50:04.800 --> 50:08.202
He took one of my hair clips
and put it in the bin.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.725
And now I can't find it,

50:09.800 --> 50:11.370
and he won't help me look for it.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.488
Okay, Evie, that's enough.

50:14.800 --> 50:17.121
Call us back when you can, okay?

51:10.200 --> 51:11.804
Hey, who's that?

51:14.680 --> 51:18.249
Say, Granddad, you look like you
trying to get to home or something?

51:19.160 --> 51:20.491
Listen, you got the time?

51:20.560 --> 51:21.971
No.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.490
Come on, you must have a cigarette
for me or something so I can get a spliff.

51:25.600 --> 51:26.931
Or a chip.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.081
- Listen, pops.
- My guy.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.730
Don't worry, we're not going
to, like, steal your shit.

51:31.400 --> 51:32.765
Just being friendly.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.445
Sorry, I didn't get that.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.329
He's taking a piss.

51:37.560 --> 51:40.370
Friendly. Anyways, what you listening to?

51:40.440 --> 51:43.523
- Let me check these out.
- No. I don't think so.

51:44.520 --> 51:46.602
Oh, hey, man's got a new iPod n'at.

51:46.680 --> 51:47.886
Man's up to date with his shit.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.365
Up to date.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.284
Say, we give this guy a Dre Beats or what?

51:53.120 --> 51:54.531
Yeah, fuck it. Come on.

51:55.840 --> 51:56.887
Trying to diss me, pops?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.570
- Yeah?
- Let him go!

51:59.640 --> 52:02.484
- Yeah, eff him up.
- What are you doing? Stop!

52:02.840 --> 52:04.080
Fuck him up.

52:07.920 --> 52:09.922
Fucking dissing me, pops?

52:11.280 --> 52:13.009
Stop him! Stop!

52:13.400 --> 52:14.526
Stop!

52:20.640 --> 52:22.324
Let it go, bruv. Let it go.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.164
Why'd you stop recording?
Daniel'll be proud.

52:24.240 --> 52:26.607
Fuck that, man! Beat! We gotta go, bruv!

52:26.680 --> 52:28.250
Fuck this old fuck.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.724
- I won!
- My turn.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.802
There you are.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.801
Bells, Bells,
could you just take that in for one sec?

53:43.880 --> 53:45.484
- I'll be a minute.
- Hey.

53:46.080 --> 53:47.206
What are you doing?

53:47.280 --> 53:48.725
I'm sorry. You've not been taking my calls.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.131
Yeah, I've been busy.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.850
You can't just turn up here
without a warning.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.002
- I know. I know. I know.
- You know that.

53:55.320 --> 53:59.086
But I just put together some photos,
old-school style,

53:59.160 --> 54:01.811
and I thought you might like it.

54:02.960 --> 54:05.122
That's really sweet, Jake.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.771
I've just got too much
to think about right now.

54:08.320 --> 54:09.446
Yeah.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.487
We've always been

54:12.600 --> 54:13.931
so good together, you know?

54:14.000 --> 54:15.968
And we missed our chance before,

54:16.040 --> 54:18.611
and I just don't want us to miss it again.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.605
What's happened?

54:22.760 --> 54:24.888
Emily, you're not back with him.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.525
I love you.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.323
I think I've always loved you, probably.

54:36.400 --> 54:37.970
Since the first time that I met you.

54:38.040 --> 54:40.611
Jake, please. Don't. Please.

54:41.960 --> 54:45.885
I did... I warned you.
It's just too complicated.

54:47.760 --> 54:52.004
And you know my life's more
than just kisses and playlists.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.565
I'm sorry.

55:26.560 --> 55:29.245
Hey, I've been looking
all over the place for you.

55:29.320 --> 55:30.401
You didn't say...

55:31.200 --> 55:32.361
Hey, what the fuck?

55:34.360 --> 55:36.124
Some kids, you know.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.571
They wanted my headphones.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.130
It was my own fault.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.565
It was late. It was getting dark.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.085
- What'd they look like?
- Just kids.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.447
And... And you're not hunting them down.

55:46.520 --> 55:50.445
- Nah, man...
- That's not your life any longer.

55:55.640 --> 55:59.531
- You've been to hospital?
- No. I'm all right, honestly.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.604
No, it's just cuts.
Bruises, you know, just...

56:04.480 --> 56:08.451
Thirty years in one square mile.

56:09.880 --> 56:12.850
Not so much as a stolen wallet.

56:16.560 --> 56:19.928
But in the greater scheme of things,

56:20.720 --> 56:22.085
doesn't really matter anyway.

56:25.080 --> 56:29.529
"A thousand landmarks perish

56:29.600 --> 56:32.809
"A hundred streets grow strange

56:32.880 --> 56:35.326
"With all the dreams they cherish

56:35.400 --> 56:38.847
"They go the ways of change

56:39.880 --> 56:42.087
"And whatso towers may tumble

56:42.160 --> 56:45.004
"Whatso bridges fall

56:45.080 --> 56:47.526
"Whatso statues crumble

56:47.600 --> 56:50.444
"Of folk both great and small

56:52.000 --> 56:54.162
"The oldest thing in London

56:56.160 --> 56:58.481
"He changes not at all."

57:04.160 --> 57:05.889
I wasn't sure if I was going to see you

57:05.960 --> 57:08.201
until your next misdemeanor.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.851
So I've been...

57:12.000 --> 57:15.527
Carrying this around.

57:23.480 --> 57:24.686
There's a phone number.

57:25.680 --> 57:28.604
Call that person and tell them I sent you.

57:28.680 --> 57:29.681
Thanks.

57:30.280 --> 57:33.090
- And breathe, remember.
- Yeah.

57:33.640 --> 57:37.281
Hey, go get yourself checked out, okay?

57:38.240 --> 57:40.846
Breathe from deep within.

57:41.600 --> 57:44.080
All right. See you later, yeah?

58:00.920 --> 58:02.729
- What's this then, bruv?
- Move, man.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.087
- Was that a love letter, fam?
- My business.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.764
Your business is my business, cuz.

58:07.480 --> 58:09.721
- Big man Jules wants to see you anyways.
- What?

58:09.840 --> 58:11.524
Why's he telling you?

58:11.600 --> 58:13.523
What you been saying?

58:13.600 --> 58:15.045
Nothing, fam.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.851
I'm just a knucklehead. Remember that.

58:17.920 --> 58:19.888
Best go see him, though.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.921
Okay, then, Kingsley,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.571
what monologue
are you going to do for us today?

59:08.640 --> 59:10.244
It's called "The Bush."

59:10.320 --> 59:13.130
It's... It's from
the Australian film Animal Kingdom,

59:13.800 --> 59:16.280
but I kind of made up my own version,

59:16.360 --> 59:17.725
if that's all right, I mean...

59:17.800 --> 59:19.882
Yeah! Sounds perfect.

59:20.840 --> 59:22.046
Okay.

59:28.360 --> 59:30.044
You know what the blocks are about?

59:30.800 --> 59:34.202
It's about dirty towers
that have stood firm for two generations,

59:34.280 --> 59:37.011
and kids who'll die before they grow old.

59:37.480 --> 59:39.881
Grim towers and hopeless kids.

59:40.800 --> 59:43.804
And everybody knows their place
in the scheme of things.

59:43.880 --> 59:47.327
Everything, everyone,
sits in the order of the blocks.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.367
Now, some survive 'cause they're strong,

59:51.080 --> 59:52.605
and there are those who are weak,

59:52.680 --> 59:55.684
but they survive
'cause they're being protected by the strong.

59:57.520 --> 59:59.329
See, because of the circles I move in,

59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.085
I thought I was one of the strong ones.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.771
But I'm not.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.561
I'm one of the weak ones.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.526
And the only reason I've survived
is 'cause I'm being protected by the strong.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.971
Run like Kingsley.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.008
Long time, brother.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.606
Yeah, man. We saying you good, yeah?

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.965
Sit down then.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.721
We've been hearing you got some issues
and you want out.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.724
All of a sudden you're better than us?

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.564
Yo, no, man, come on,
it's not even like that...

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.721
- So, what is it like then?
- Yo.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.846
Give the man a minute, Vincent.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.800
He just got here.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.209
But they're not strong anymore,

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.165
and they can't protect me now.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.481
But in life, you always have an out.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.360
The thing is, the less you have,
the higher the price you have to pay.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.924
A boss needs to keep control, yeah?

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.091
And if you lose respect,
that's a problem, innit?

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.366
Yeah.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.090
Bad for business.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.765
Now, I know you got yourself pinched,

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.849
but I also know that your boy Daniel

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.968
has been talking to the police.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.046
And so what do you say?

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.851
Am I dealing with, like,
a little coup from within here?

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.649
No, no, no. No way.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.486
Look, I've known Daniel my entire life.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.210
He's a lot of things, but he ain't no snitch.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.090
It's a fact,
and this ain't some muggy 9:00 to 5:00

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.481
where you can just hand in your notice.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.928
You can try and leave this life,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.365
but this life will never leave you.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.124
Very poetic. Thank you, Vincent.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.648
Hey, look, I've got a soldier
who's ready to step up.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.605
Nothing will change for you, man.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.324
I can vouch for him.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.605
All right.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.166
All right.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.891
Got a very simple proposition for you.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.884
The weed on your path

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.964
to a better life has to be gone.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.650
You understand?

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.482
You still got that gun I gave you?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.925
Kind of.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.843
Someone's looking after it for me, innit?

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.488
Well, someone better give you it back.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.171
We won't meet this new man
till Daniel's gone.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.685
Am I clear?

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.691
Am I clear?

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.211
Am I clear on the price I have to pay
to leave my old life behind?

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.171
Yeah.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.480
I am.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.885
Crystal clear.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.889
So, how do you know Terence?

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.884
We live in the same area, so, you know.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.086
Yeah.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.844
Do you live with your parents?

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.321
I did live with my mom until recently.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.370
But I kind of moved on, still.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.249
And my dad...

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.766
Boy, I ain't seen that guy in time.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.322
That man got a new family.
I guess he moved on as well.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.649
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.245
I didn't mean to pry.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.891
Nah, nah, it's cool. It's no biggie.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.201
Yeah, anyway, I better get going.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.169
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.249
Final audition.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.290
Oh, yeah. Yeah, all right. Cool, all right.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.601
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.405
There he is! There he is!

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.481
There's Daddy. Go on.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.722
- You want to say hi?
- There's my monsters!

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.726
Come here.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.565
Come here, you two.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.449
I've missed you so much, so much.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.683
- You going to go play, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.323
You're early for once.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.481
Yeah, I've been running.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.884
Like the old days.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.481
You look different.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.446
Do I?

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.884
No, I'm just me.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.604
It's good
that you're straightening yourself out.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.808
I heard about the nosebleed.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.769
Do you mind if we get a photo, Max?

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.323
No, not today, mate.
I'm just with the family, okay, yeah?

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.846
- Cheers.
- No worries.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.326
No, I just want
to concentrate on being a good dad.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.446
Come and play, Daddy!

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.650
All right then.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.840
Oh, man.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.011
Here I come!

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.003
For Chris and Samantha,

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.562
having a large garden
is top of their list of priorities.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.325
With three growing boys
and one more on the way,

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.482
space to run around is essential.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.723
The first property I've found
ticks all of those boxes.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.768
But is it too far out of town?

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.126
So, guys, what do you think?

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.850
Oh, it's absolutely gorgeous.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.082
Oh, it's so lovely..

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.723
Come on, George,
you've been sat in that chair all day again.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.531
And you ain't touched the lunch I left.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.361
Right, we need to get you out of here.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.970
You've got five minutes,
you best pull yourself together.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.285
I mean it, George. Five minutes.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.203
You remember
what happened here nearly 20 years ago?

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.806
Yeah. Course I do.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.968
You got down on one knee
and promised me the world.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.486
And you delivered.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.086
Maybe not the big house full of kids.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.450
But you told me you'd be my rock forever.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.444
And you have, George.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.084
Really, you have.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.488
But I've made my decision.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.680
We can't bring a kid into all this.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.282
We can't do it right now.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.849
We may never be able to.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.647
I know what I'm saying, and...

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.246
And I'm all right with it.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.130
- Sweetheart, you know...
- No, just let me finish.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.247
You know I've always wanted a kid,

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.130
and as much as it's hurt over the years...

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.123
With me mum going on
and all my friends having 'em.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.649
If I'm given a choice

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.651
of getting my husband back,

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.129
or getting a new baby,

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.005
I'd pick you

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.245
every time.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.482
I just want my rock back.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.202
It was an accident, love,

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.203
plain and simple.

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:27.680
I know. I know.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.881
- Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
- That's all right.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.886
I've got bad news, I'm afraid.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:10.408
Terence died this morning.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.481
What do you mean he's dead? He...

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.245
No, he can't be, I saw him just...

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.810
I'm so sorry.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.399
How?

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.930
Is this from when he was robbed?

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.562
He had internal bleeding,
so he didn't know, and...

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.249
I kept telling him to go to hospital,
but he just...

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.527
He said he was fine, man!

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:37.930
Fuck!

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.841
Fine!

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.651
Yo, Kings!

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.687
I was looking for you everywhere.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.722
- You okay, yeah?
- Yeah, man.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.164
Just had a bit of bad news, that's all.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.446
What, Jules?

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.649
Nah, nah, nah,
just some shit in my other world.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.882
He wants to meet, though.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.521
Yeah?

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.166
What, you sure he's gonna trust me?

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.401
Yeah, man, don't watch that.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.606
He knows you've been my boy for a time.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.481
Nice.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.331
You're gonna be on your own now, though.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.607
You sure you're gonna be cool with that?

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.445
Yeah, man, I've been on my own for time.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.968
No more looking in the rearview.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.805
Your man's got a future on you now.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.530
What about Daniel?

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.880
Yeah, I've still got
to take care of that, man.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.329
Man should've known who he's dealing with!

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.087
Oh, shit,
what brings you round these days, cuz?

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.645
I thought you got chucked out.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.449
Yo, Jules wants you gone, fam.
He don't trust you.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.806
He thinks you're working with the feds.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.331
What you been smoking, cuz?

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.731
Yo, this ain't no joke, tin man.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.887
He knows you ain't been nicked.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.200
You need to leave the ends now.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.965
- I can't just leave like that, cuz.
- You okay, D?

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.042
Yo, fuck off, little man.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.444
Where the fuck you get these from, bruv?

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.244
- These are mine.
- What?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.042
- Let me check these out.
- No, I don't think so.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.320
Get the fuck off, man!

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.884
You nearly fucking killed our boy, cuz!

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.007
That ain't our boy!

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.445
And we ain't on nuttin' no more!

01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.806
What the fuck you talking about, fam?

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.325
Watch too many movies or something, cuz?

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.970
You see what these little cunts do
to impress you?

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.887
I ain't their boss, fam!

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.008
Seriously, man,
I can't have you fucking with my future.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.565
Hello!

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.250
Anybody home?

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.087
No?

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.524
Just as I planned it.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.202
Where do you keep your vases?

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.685
Beautiful.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.491
Fuck!

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.082
Come on. Pick up the phone.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.084
- Can we buy Daddy a present?
- Yes, we can, Evie,

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.049
but we've got to be quick
because we've got to get back.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.963
- Shall we call Daddy? See if he's at home?
- Yeah.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.041
Then we'll know what he wants.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.645
Shit, the battery's dead.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.767
What did I tell you, Leo?

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.491
If you play those games,
the battery's going to die.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.642
Yeah, you've got to listen to Mummy.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.926
Fucking slag. You fucking slag.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.848
Hello, is that Simon?

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.684
Yeah, it's... It's George Radford.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.125
The cab driver.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.207
I tried to call before, yeah.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.966
Yeah. Yeah, you know.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.448
Listen, I... I know it might be too soon,

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.364
but I was wondering
if maybe we could meet up?

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.726
I won't take up much of your time,

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.646
and I totally understand
if it's not something you want to do.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.491
What, today?

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.924
Yeah, are you sure?

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.569
All right, great.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.880
All right, Simon, thank you.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.088
I'll... I'll see you there.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.047
Ta.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.449
Yeah, if it was you,
I'd want to meet the geezer that done it.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.209
Right, what shall we get Daddy then?

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.851
Some headphones
because I remember breaking them.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.810
Did you break them? Well, let's see.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.609
I don't know where they are.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.681
Look, Mommy,

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.922
our house is on TV.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.844
I'm not so sure, Leo.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.566
Okay, kids, come on.
Come on, we're going to go now.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.130
Come with me.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.811
A siege is now developing
here in southwest London.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.120
The rugby captain,

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.646
former England rugby captain Max Moore

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.082
- is armed with a shotgun...
- Max, put down the gun and pick up the phone!

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.645
That's right.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.203
Max! Please pick up the phone!

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.167
I ain't fucking talking to none of you
pussyholes until I fucking see my wife.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.049
Fucking see my wife.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.288
Where is she? Where's my wife?

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.880
I want my wife! Get my wife out here now!

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.167
- We don't think that this...
- Come on, you could've shot me by now!

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.442
I'm standing right here! Look at me!

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.488
Police are certainly here...

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.800
What, are you afraid to pull the trigger?

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.291
Why haven't you shot? Are you scared?

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.801
Because I'm not!

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.929
What happened, exactly?

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.201
I was on my way home.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.647
It was the last fare of the day.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.843
I had this fella in the back.
I almost didn't pick him up.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.403
He was going on and on.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.847
Then this woman just...

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.160
She just pulled out in front of me.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.810
She didn't even look.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.284
So, I swerved to avoid her.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.441
And...

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.721
And that's when I hit your wife.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.924
Tell me one thing.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.966
Was she smiling?

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.565
What?

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.122
Ruth, when it happened, was she smiling?

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.486
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.728
When she crossed the road...

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.166
Did she look happy?

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.446
Yeah.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.688
Yeah, she looked very happy.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.408
Actually, just walking past me now is Emily.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.481
Emily, you're live on Sky.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.728
Do you think we might have
a very quick word with you?

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.928
That's my house, that's my...
That's my husband!

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.081
I need to talk to him!

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.810
I need to talk to him.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.691
Please put down the gun
and pick up the phone!

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.205
Move back now!

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.889
- Look, hey, I'm not fucking speaking...
- Hi, Max, it's Emily.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.880
Max, what's going on?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.240
Why the fuck have you got a gun?

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.561
Where the fuck have you been all day?
You fucking betrayed me.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.769
And if I want to fucking talk to you,
but you just fucking betray me,

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.410
- is that what's going on?
- I don't understand.

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.845
Who... Who are you mad at?

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.046
Who the fuck am I mad at?

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.724
You fucking fucked that little prick!

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.810
Why did you have to fucking do
all of that shit?

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.006
It's gonna end today, darling.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.447
It's gonna end you, me,
and that little prick!

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.046
Bring him up here! Bring him here!

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.286
Why did you have
to fucking run away with college boy, yeah?

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.805
Because I'm not a fucking romantic man?

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.201
Mr. Fucking Romantic!
Mr. Fucking College Boy?

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.248
I'm not him? I fucking work hard!

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.690
I live in the fucking real world

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.524
where you have to fucking work.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.524
And I work and I fucking pay,
and I fucking sacrifice!

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.567
All right, you're fucking...

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.085
Now you're pregnant with this stupid cunt.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.562
You're pregnant!
Why didn't you fucking just tell me that?

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.806
Hi, Kath. Don't know where you got to.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.530
I've been trying to call you all day.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.760
Anyway, I did it. I'm back in the cab.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.524
Same old chaos out here.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.326
Bell me when you get this, though, yeah?

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.521
Let me know you're all right.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.610
See you later. Bye.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.081
What the fuck?

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.730
Look, I didn't know what I wanted then,

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.928
and I was getting myself back together,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.607
and then you going off
doing the "poor old me" thing.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.843
That's right, blame me!
It's my fault, isn't it?

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.248
What are you fucking saying?
It's all my fault?

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.561
You wouldn't have gotten pregnant
by that fucking...

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.210
It's yours, Max.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.929
Trust me. I didn't take any risks.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.286
It can only be yours.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.648
I told you to be gone, man.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.451
Time moves on,
and you ain't nothing but a dumb relic now.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.490
Vincent told me if I don't get rid of you,
then we're both done.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.005
Go on, fucking do it, then!

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.565
Go on! Do it!

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.524
You have to end this now.
You have to make a decision.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.251
What do you really, really want?
What's important to you?

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.765
You're not even gonna do it, are you?

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.169
He's a fucking pussy, yo!

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.446
Hey, step aside, Kings.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.886
Oh, shit.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.405
Think about your children.
Think about Leo and Evie.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.448
They need you. They need their dad.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.284
Max, talk to me.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.763
Put down the gun!

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.683
All right. All right.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.448
Yeah. All right.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.081
I give up. All right.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.691
Put down the gun!

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.603
I'm putting it down, all right?

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.251
I'm putting it down.
I'm putting it down. Look.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.130
- All right, there it is.
- Put your hands up!

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.202
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.009
Put your hands on your head.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.967
Suspect has given himself up.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:25.961
Kathy?

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.325
Kathy, love?

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.042
Hello, Leon. Where's Mum?

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.761
Kathy?

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.966

Surprise!

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.008
