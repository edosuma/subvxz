01:37.109 --> 01:38.742
<i>Get ready for</i>

01:38.744 --> 01:40.645
<i>The Lionel Macomb Show.</i>

01:40.946 --> 01:43.414
<i>Lionel Macomb is fired up.</i>

01:43.416 --> 01:45.949
<i>Oh, you're so hot,
Lionel.</i>

01:47.752 --> 01:49.953
Greetings, friends, patriots,

01:49.955 --> 01:51.321
you're listening to <i>Fired Up.</i>

01:51.323 --> 01:53.258
I'm your host, Lionel Macomb.

01:53.692 --> 01:57.694
Your humble steward,
your deliverer of hard truths,

01:57.696 --> 02:00.263
a beacon of light
in the dark harbor.

02:00.265 --> 02:03.266
Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses.

02:03.268 --> 02:05.368
Bring me your over taxed,
your underlaid,

02:05.370 --> 02:07.069
your put-down, your fed up,

02:07.071 --> 02:09.005
bring me your rage.

02:09.007 --> 02:10.440
This morning, I bring you news

02:10.442 --> 02:11.807
of a fresh threat
to our republic.

02:11.809 --> 02:15.778
Our old friend, Judith
Montefiore "Hyphen" Salters,

02:15.780 --> 02:17.881
has brought a new bill
to the senate floor.

02:17.883 --> 02:19.681
Judy in her infinite wisdom

02:19.683 --> 02:21.450
wants to offer
a fresh round of amnesty

02:21.452 --> 02:24.153
to the millions of illegal kids
flooding our borders.

02:24.155 --> 02:26.722
So long as they stick around
and go to college.

02:26.724 --> 02:29.459
That's right, folks.
If you came here off the books,

02:29.461 --> 02:31.827
but you hit the books,
you can stay put.

02:31.829 --> 02:33.729
Maybe even steal a scholarship

02:33.731 --> 02:36.232
from a valedictorian in Tucson,
while you're at it.

02:36.234 --> 02:39.034
The Hyphen calls
this act of treason

02:39.036 --> 02:42.037
the Clean Slate Initiative.
And I guess it is a clean slate.

02:42.039 --> 02:44.406
If you want to demolish
our systems of justice

02:44.408 --> 02:45.874
and education in one fell swoop.

02:56.887 --> 02:58.353
<i>I'm a practical guy.</i>

02:58.355 --> 03:00.722
I'm not saying
we should build a wall.

03:00.724 --> 03:03.791
No, I... I think a... A moat
would be more effective,

03:03.793 --> 03:07.029
with a wall behind it,
topped with coils of barbed wire

03:07.031 --> 03:08.865
painted a dazzling
red, white, and blue.

03:09.065 --> 03:11.133
Because make no mistake,
my friends,

03:11.135 --> 03:13.170
we're in the midst
of a full-scale invasion here.

03:14.772 --> 03:17.272
What kind of message
does the Clean Slate Initiative

03:17.274 --> 03:19.141
send to the untold masses

03:19.143 --> 03:21.011
plotting to infiltrate
our borders?

03:21.212 --> 03:24.480
"Come on over. All is forgiven.
The more, the merrier."

03:24.482 --> 03:27.982
<i>This ain't a game of red rover,
folks. This is our homeland.</i>

03:27.984 --> 03:29.818
You know what I always say...

03:29.820 --> 03:31.886
<i>"No free ride."</i>

03:31.888 --> 03:34.022
Smart kids. But I can hear
the other side now.

03:34.024 --> 03:36.391
"Lionel, think of the children."

03:36.393 --> 03:37.892
I do.
That's why I never had any.

03:37.894 --> 03:41.263
And if I did, I'd make damn sure
I set a good example to them.

03:41.265 --> 03:44.168
It's a question
of personal responsibility.

03:44.868 --> 03:47.034
But the Hyphen
sees things differently.

03:47.036 --> 03:49.871
For instance, I prefer to go by
only one last name.

03:49.873 --> 03:53.177
I mean, how many syllables
does one woman really need?

03:53.810 --> 03:55.843
I've seen Judy up close,
too close.

03:55.845 --> 03:57.913
And believe me,
there's not enough going on

03:57.915 --> 03:59.548
to support all that alphabet.

03:59.550 --> 04:02.985
The fact is, Clean Slate
is a treasonous time bomb

04:02.987 --> 04:06.554
which makes Judy
today's public enemy <i>numero uno.</i>

04:09.125 --> 04:10.894
But this fight's
bigger than Judy,

04:11.427 --> 04:14.195
it's bigger than me which is why
I come here every day,

04:14.197 --> 04:15.530
ready to do battle.

04:15.532 --> 04:18.833
I know you're with me,
my army of the indignant.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.968
My hordes of hell-raisers.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.171
Don't stay silent,
we're gonna open up the phones.

04:23.173 --> 04:26.107
Speak up.
So who's ready to march with me?

04:26.109 --> 04:28.009
Who's ready to fight with me?

05:00.143 --> 05:02.076
Hey, it's your first time
in New York?

05:02.078 --> 05:03.011
Maybe.

05:04.046 --> 05:05.213
Because, you know,
it's a big city.

05:05.215 --> 05:06.113
You should probably
get a tour guide.

05:06.115 --> 05:08.717
You know, it's unpredictable.

05:09.051 --> 05:10.917
Some things
are pretty predictable.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.888
Yeah. You got a place to stay?
Uh...

05:13.088 --> 05:14.157
I know all the best places.

05:15.225 --> 05:17.025
Let me show you around
for the afternoon.

05:17.226 --> 05:18.894
- No charge.
- Move.

05:19.128 --> 05:20.628
- Move?
- I really don't care

05:20.630 --> 05:22.229
what you do, but he does.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.443
Lionel, do you have a minute

05:35.445 --> 05:38.279
- to talk about Gareth Whitley?
- Gareth who?

05:38.281 --> 05:40.581
He used to work for you. Now
he's killing you in the ratings.

05:40.583 --> 05:42.249
- How do you feel about it?
- Hey, Wendell.

05:42.251 --> 05:43.950
- Hi.
- How's the job search going?

05:43.952 --> 05:45.452
I've already got a job,
Mr. Macomb.

05:45.454 --> 05:46.953
It's promoting
a more civil tone

05:46.955 --> 05:48.422
for our national conversation.

05:48.424 --> 05:49.491
That come with dental?

05:51.026 --> 05:55.130
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic.
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.064
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.233
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.103
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic.

06:03.105 --> 06:05.540
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic.

06:37.072 --> 06:38.806
Hi. I'm here for Lionel Macomb.

06:41.376 --> 06:43.377
And who may I say is calling?

06:44.111 --> 06:46.181
Actually, I'm not here
for Mr. Macomb.

06:46.715 --> 06:49.283
My mom, she works in his
apartment housekeeping and...

06:49.483 --> 06:50.185
uh...

06:53.087 --> 06:54.121
Look, I need to see her...

06:55.190 --> 06:57.491
right away.
It's a family emergency.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.428
Well, we'll have
the maid sent down.

07:01.430 --> 07:02.897
What's her name?

07:08.302 --> 07:10.302
- Miss?
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.638
- What's happening?
- I know... I'm trying to... I...

07:12.640 --> 07:14.005
- What's her name?
- I don't... I don't...

07:14.007 --> 07:15.207
I don't want to make a scene.

07:15.209 --> 07:16.342
Okay. I don't want
to make a scene. I'm...

07:16.344 --> 07:17.743
I'm sorry. I just...
I need my mom.

07:17.745 --> 07:20.212
- I need my mom. I need my mom.
- Just stop. Slow down.

07:20.214 --> 07:23.417
- Lawrence, bro. Have a heart.
- Yes, sir.

07:28.088 --> 07:30.291
Your name?

07:31.592 --> 07:32.526
Tess.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.363
Hi. Uh, I'm sorry.

07:37.365 --> 07:39.400
There seems to be
some confusion.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.898
Uh, I'm... I'm new here,

07:40.900 --> 07:42.402
so I'm not quite sure
who your mother is.

07:43.571 --> 07:44.638
Oh, that's okay.
She's in the laundry room.

07:46.239 --> 07:47.575
Yeah, it's fine,
I'll just wait here.

07:49.276 --> 07:50.211
Okay.

08:00.186 --> 08:01.554
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.659
Miss, I really have to ask
that you not go in there.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.227
- Okay.
- Thank you.

08:09.229 --> 08:10.696
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.562
Sorry.

08:11.564 --> 08:13.699
Oh, my God.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.543
Who is this?

08:25.545 --> 08:27.713
Uh, I... I don't know, sir.

08:27.715 --> 08:28.881
You don't know?

08:28.883 --> 08:30.316
I asked her to wait
out in the hallway

08:31.385 --> 08:32.283
- and she pushed me.
- She pushed you?

08:32.284 --> 08:34.619
Well, she... pushed passed me.

08:34.621 --> 08:37.054
She said she's
the housekeeper's daughter.

08:37.056 --> 08:38.224
You are not my daughter.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.258
Tyler, you're new.

08:40.260 --> 08:42.260
- Summa cum laude at Stanford.
- Penn.

08:42.261 --> 08:44.495
So it's unlikely
you're a complete moron.

08:44.497 --> 08:47.298
Rule number one, do not let
strangers through my front door,

08:47.300 --> 08:49.367
down my hall,
and into my fucking bedroom.

08:49.369 --> 08:50.270
Yes, sir.

08:51.604 --> 08:53.039
It's a nice place.

08:54.206 --> 08:57.243
- It's roomy.
- Who are you?

08:57.477 --> 08:59.647
It's kind of a long story
but the best ones are, right?

09:01.848 --> 09:04.415
If it's okay, I'm gonna look
at him while I talk to you.

09:04.417 --> 09:06.085
NYPD is on its way,

09:06.286 --> 09:09.121
so I suggest you stop being cute
and answer my question.

09:12.224 --> 09:13.258
I'm Tess...

09:14.527 --> 09:16.028
I'm Laurie's daughter.

09:19.866 --> 09:21.099
I'm your niece.

09:22.134 --> 09:23.035
Niece?

09:28.140 --> 09:30.008
I thought
you were gonna say daughter.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.344
Didn't you think
she was gonna say daughter?

09:34.447 --> 09:36.248
How did you find out
where I live?

09:36.548 --> 09:39.017
Follow the trail
of fire and brimstone.

09:41.420 --> 09:42.421
Google.

09:42.789 --> 09:44.323
Your mom talked about me?

09:45.692 --> 09:47.192
Uh, yeah, you know,
we catch your show sometimes.

09:48.361 --> 09:50.262
Long-time listener,
first time caller.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.364
Well, I'm guessing you know
a little of our family history,

09:53.366 --> 09:54.564
and based on the fact that

09:54.566 --> 09:56.533
I never laid eyes on you
till 20 minutes ago,

09:56.535 --> 09:58.469
you can draw
your own conclusions

09:58.471 --> 09:59.569
about my level of interest

09:59.571 --> 10:02.241
in your mother's life
or your own.

10:03.175 --> 10:04.674
I'd say
pretty much non-existent.

10:04.676 --> 10:06.110
Let's not qualify it.

10:06.612 --> 10:08.514
So given that,
why would you come see me?

10:08.714 --> 10:13.783
Well, um... at this point,
it's either here, or a shelter.

10:13.785 --> 10:15.819
What about your mom,
where is she?

10:15.821 --> 10:17.489
Hiding in the wine closet?

10:20.392 --> 10:21.661
She's at Three Oaks.

10:22.862 --> 10:24.361
What is it this time?

10:24.363 --> 10:26.198
Booze? Pills?

10:26.833 --> 10:28.333
Booze and pills?

10:29.668 --> 10:32.369
Well, congratulations!
You've breached the keep,

10:32.371 --> 10:34.305
but, uh,
you're gonna have to leave.

10:36.308 --> 10:37.641
Hey, but... But I...

10:37.643 --> 10:39.643
But I told you I don't...
I don't have anywhere to go.

10:39.645 --> 10:41.278
That's not my problem.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.913
It's a question
of responsibility.

10:42.915 --> 10:44.716
Personal responsibility?

10:44.950 --> 10:47.352
Not my personal responsibility.

10:47.619 --> 10:48.587
You're not my kid.

10:49.855 --> 10:51.055
I have no legal obligation
to you whatsoever.

10:51.256 --> 10:52.223
Right, Kent?

10:55.360 --> 10:57.395
Now, go. Get.

10:58.429 --> 10:59.163
Goodbye.

11:02.768 --> 11:04.701
No, no can do, Uncle Lionel.

11:04.703 --> 11:06.402
Yes, can do.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.139
Can very much do.

11:08.472 --> 11:09.708
One tweet should do it.

11:10.609 --> 11:11.542
Yeah.

11:12.710 --> 11:15.879
A short, sad story
about a 16-year-old girl

11:15.881 --> 11:17.780
who goes looking for
her only living relative

11:17.782 --> 11:19.049
not currently in rehab,

11:19.051 --> 11:21.617
a gazillionaire uncle
who just happens to be

11:21.619 --> 11:23.321
the reigning king of talk radio.

11:23.522 --> 11:24.988
When she finally
tracks him down,

11:24.990 --> 11:26.188
he kicks her
right back out again

11:26.190 --> 11:27.623
onto the mean streets
of New York City.

11:27.625 --> 11:31.360
Only to be swept up in the
tangled web of social services.

11:31.362 --> 11:33.362
That's right, folks.
It turns out the guy

11:33.364 --> 11:35.564
who blasts other people
for living off the system

11:35.566 --> 11:37.901
is perfectly fine
with forcing his own family

11:37.903 --> 11:41.104
onto the tired shoulders
of the American taxpayers.

11:42.339 --> 11:43.341
Well, I'm...

11:43.942 --> 11:46.242
no expert but it seems like...

11:47.277 --> 11:48.878
I think the last problem
you need right now

11:48.880 --> 11:50.214
in a ratings war...

11:51.749 --> 11:53.451
with your contract up.

11:55.252 --> 11:56.152
Right, Kent?

12:03.327 --> 12:05.763
That's way more than
a hundred and forty characters.

12:08.432 --> 12:10.166
It was nice
working with you, John.

12:10.634 --> 12:11.702
I'm sorry.

12:21.379 --> 12:22.213
Hi.

12:22.913 --> 12:24.581
We're good.
Thanks, John.

12:27.051 --> 12:28.717
Who are you?
Another lawyer?

12:28.719 --> 12:29.751
Oh, no.

12:29.753 --> 12:32.590
I'm Val.
I'm a publicist actually.

12:33.057 --> 12:34.758
I'm also Lionel's girlfriend.

12:35.291 --> 12:38.228
And you are the invading niece.

12:39.529 --> 12:42.397
You hungry?
You see Lorenzo made foie gras.

12:42.399 --> 12:44.599
- Do you eat foie gras?
- It depends.

12:44.601 --> 12:45.770
What is foie gras?

12:46.837 --> 12:48.204
Goose liver.

12:48.705 --> 12:50.206
Yeah, me either.

12:51.675 --> 12:52.807
Lionel only likes it because
it's illegal in California.

12:52.809 --> 12:53.843
I brought this.

12:56.914 --> 12:58.648
- Can... Can I?
- Yeah, of course.

12:58.982 --> 13:00.350
You are hungry.

13:00.617 --> 13:02.185
Do you have any ketchup?

13:08.458 --> 13:09.657
<i>No, I'm serious.</i>

13:09.659 --> 13:12.060
So there's this
twenty-five-year-old popstar

13:12.062 --> 13:14.063
with 40 million followers,

13:14.065 --> 13:15.863
traipsing through
the Meatpacking District

13:15.865 --> 13:17.565
with nothing on but a sock,

13:17.567 --> 13:19.500
and not on his foot either.

13:19.502 --> 13:21.971
Yeah. There's cell phone video
of the whole thing.

13:22.172 --> 13:24.972
- How did I not know about this?
- Because I'm good at my job.

13:24.974 --> 13:27.407
My job is to make
fools look foolish.

13:27.409 --> 13:29.813
Val's job is to make them look
tragically misunderstood.

13:30.613 --> 13:33.249
Sometimes, the toughest battles
are fought at home.

13:34.784 --> 13:37.752
Because I'm a kind
and generous guy,

13:37.754 --> 13:39.620
I've decided to let you stay
the weekend

13:39.622 --> 13:41.523
while we figure out
what to do with you.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.561
But I lead a private life and
I'd like to keep it that way.

13:45.829 --> 13:47.929
Personal boundaries
may be elastic to you,

13:47.931 --> 13:49.264
but they're not to me.

13:49.866 --> 13:52.633
No sob stories will be broadcast

13:52.635 --> 13:54.003
on the internet
while you're here.

13:57.073 --> 13:59.341
- Wait a second. How old are you?
- Sixteen.

13:59.641 --> 14:02.777
She can't sign this.
She's a minor.

14:02.779 --> 14:04.013
This is not binding.

14:05.215 --> 14:06.248
Kent would know that
better than anyone.

14:08.718 --> 14:10.552
Oh, but this isn't coming
from Kent, is it?

14:13.388 --> 14:14.456
She didn't know that.

14:15.424 --> 14:16.459
I will show you to your room.

14:20.596 --> 14:21.896
- Thanks.
- Good night.

14:21.898 --> 14:22.798
Night.

15:09.611 --> 15:13.013
Good morning,
and welcome to New York City.

15:13.015 --> 15:15.115
Another bright and sunny day

15:15.117 --> 15:18.151
full of promised possibility
and bullshit.

15:18.153 --> 15:20.687
But not from me.
I'm your host, Lionel Macomb.

15:20.689 --> 15:21.756
Morning, sunshine.

15:27.929 --> 15:29.830
Do you want
cornflake French toast?

15:29.832 --> 15:30.731
Mm-hmm.

15:31.933 --> 15:32.935
She wants cornflake
French toast. I got you.

15:34.136 --> 15:36.036
Do not use the house phone.

15:36.038 --> 15:37.671
If there's an emergency,

15:37.673 --> 15:39.707
and there better not be,
use this.

15:41.709 --> 15:43.111
It's okay. I have a phone.

15:44.579 --> 15:47.081
Yeah. The nice thing about this
one is it actually makes calls.

15:47.983 --> 15:50.649
The media room is off limits,
and the study,

15:50.651 --> 15:52.855
and the kitchen's closed
when Lorenzo's not in it.

15:53.055 --> 15:54.122
Where can I go?

16:50.011 --> 16:51.478
We lost Maniker.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.615
Just Maniker?

16:56.017 --> 16:58.084
Maniker and EFP.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.119
Can you buy time somewhere else?

17:00.121 --> 17:02.787
Your numbers are holding steady,
more or less.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.125
- Well, more or less?
- Less. Not much less.

17:06.127 --> 17:08.127
It's a temporary dip.
The thrill of the new.

17:08.796 --> 17:10.595
Whitley,
he's playing the nice guy.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.030
He kills them with kindness.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.231
I just kill them.

17:13.233 --> 17:13.999
He's working
the clean-cut angle.

17:14.001 --> 17:15.067
Born-again family man

17:15.069 --> 17:16.869
preaching to the flock
on Sunday.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.205
The charm will wear off.
People get tired of that.

17:20.308 --> 17:20.906
Not for 2,000 years,
they haven't.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.007
He's making a play.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.076
When the nationalists
go down in flames,

17:24.078 --> 17:26.778
he'll be there
selling holy water

17:26.780 --> 17:27.980
to put out the fire.

17:27.982 --> 17:29.048
All right.
Whitley's got God on his side.

17:29.050 --> 17:31.983
But you,
you have angry factory workers,

17:31.985 --> 17:34.018
angry farmers,
angry coal miners.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.853
What about the coastal elites?

17:35.855 --> 17:37.288
You didn't lose them.
You never had them.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.991
I know. I just like saying
coastal elites.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.727
People still need you, Lionel,

17:41.928 --> 17:43.828
to fire them up
and light the way.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.964
They'll get bored with Whitley.
They'll come back.

17:45.966 --> 17:47.665
I'm sure our friends at OneVoice

17:47.667 --> 17:49.734
are full of the same
plucky optimism.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.206
Must be why Claremont
summoned me for lunch tomorrow,

17:52.406 --> 17:54.573
to give me a pep talk
and a pat on the back.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.776
- Lunch with the big boss?
- Look,

17:57.077 --> 17:57.978
no matter what he says,

17:59.179 --> 18:00.144
you still have time
to... To right this ship.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.849
But...
come September, we're...

18:03.116 --> 18:04.483
We're gonna need a new deal.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.666
Jesus Christ, Kent!

18:21.134 --> 18:23.069
You're like the ghost
of a Brooks Brother.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.937
- Just heard from Boyd.
- And?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.873
Well, kid's story holds up.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.407
Your sister,

18:29.409 --> 18:31.742
she checked herself
into Three Oaks on Friday

18:31.744 --> 18:34.211
and as of 9:52 this morning,
she's still there.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.347
Where has Tess have been
for the past four days?

18:36.349 --> 18:37.649
On a bus, I imagine.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.719
Look, by all accounts,
she's a good kid.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.988
Four schools in five years.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.858
At or near
the top of her class every year.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.027
She's been offered a place
at Harper in the fall.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.228
Ah.

18:51.930 --> 18:52.996
She wants money.

18:52.998 --> 18:54.332
They're offering her
a full ride.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.134
- She's working an angle.
- We'll keep tabs on Laurie.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.268
I'll let you know
if anything changes.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.306
Meanwhile...
just keep Tess close.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.773
Close isn't really my thing,
Kent.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.044
Well, think of it this way,

19:05.711 --> 19:08.546
you know where she is,
no surprises.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.934
Wow.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.045
Yo, housekeeper's daughter.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.681
Did everything work out
for you yesterday?

19:43.782 --> 19:45.117
Yeah, it did actually.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.353
- Hey, thank you.
- I'm Gennady, 15D.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.255
- Tess.
- Where are you headed, Tess?

19:52.257 --> 19:55.260
The park.
I've never been.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.728
You don't want to go
to the park.

20:03.335 --> 20:06.336
I don't wanna go.
This is cruel and unusual.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.974
It's a benefit
for Doctors Without Borders.

20:10.374 --> 20:13.310
I wrote the doctors a check,
isn't that the point?

20:13.312 --> 20:15.946
I respect their borders.
Why don't they respect mine?

20:15.948 --> 20:17.780
It's good for you
to be seen right now.

20:17.782 --> 20:19.782
I don't wanna be seen.
That's why I work in radio.

20:19.784 --> 20:22.486
Right.
You hate the spotlight.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.054
Valerie, darling.
Given the choice,

20:25.056 --> 20:26.358
wouldn't you much rather be

20:27.758 --> 20:29.325
eating pizza in the courtyard
at Rocco's right now?

20:29.327 --> 20:31.461
Well, yeah. But last I heard,

20:31.463 --> 20:33.529
Rocco was working
as a sommelier in Alba,

20:33.531 --> 20:34.931
so nice try.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.634
But is he?

20:50.314 --> 20:52.682
Rocco, I can't believe
you're back.

20:52.916 --> 20:56.185
Only for tonight
and only for you.

20:58.289 --> 20:59.290
Thanks, Rocco.

21:01.559 --> 21:04.662
You really didn't wanna go
to that benefit, did you?

21:04.996 --> 21:06.495
No, I really didn't.

21:26.384 --> 21:29.886
Uh, no, thanks.
Uh... I'm on medication.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.988
Ooh, which ones?

21:32.590 --> 21:34.590
Actually, I just...
I don't drink.

21:34.592 --> 21:36.391
It doesn't go well
with my genes.

21:36.393 --> 21:38.194
I respect that. I do.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.096
Looks like you need
some new jeans.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.799
She means her DNA, dumbfuck.

21:47.004 --> 21:49.272
Whatever you're apologizing for,
I forgive you.

21:51.942 --> 21:53.344
So are we gonna talk about it?

21:57.315 --> 22:01.049
Um... well,
we're in a good place, right?

22:01.051 --> 22:02.919
I mean, we're here
at Rocco's and...

22:03.453 --> 22:05.021
But also a place of...

22:05.622 --> 22:08.156
- mutual understanding...
- I'm talking about Tess,

22:08.158 --> 22:09.292
- Lionel.
- Oh, right.

22:09.593 --> 22:11.928
Thank God. Um...

22:12.295 --> 22:13.528
Boyd found my sister.

22:13.530 --> 22:14.596
We're gonna call her
first thing tomorrow,

22:14.598 --> 22:16.500
and then we're gonna
send Tess home.

22:17.968 --> 22:19.135
You're joking, right?

22:20.069 --> 22:21.972
Lionel, you can't do that.

22:22.639 --> 22:25.107
She's a kid.
She needs your help.

22:25.307 --> 22:26.343
Nobody helped me.

22:27.477 --> 22:28.777
Exactly.

22:30.213 --> 22:31.381
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

22:31.615 --> 22:33.516
I don't wanna upset Rocco.
He's...

22:34.083 --> 22:35.385
He's very sensitive.

22:36.486 --> 22:37.918
Okay. Fine.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.288
Would you rather talk about us?

22:51.401 --> 22:53.235
Shit. Stanford.

22:54.271 --> 22:55.370
Remember I fired you?

22:55.372 --> 22:58.138
Y... Yeah. I remember,
uh, vividly,

22:58.140 --> 23:00.076
but then I got this.

23:02.077 --> 23:03.245
"Dear Tyler..."

23:03.579 --> 23:04.780
Who's Tyler?

23:05.448 --> 23:08.117
That... Uh... That's... me.

23:08.551 --> 23:09.519
Oh, right.

23:10.886 --> 23:11.918
Uh, "I wanna apologize
for what happened yesterday.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.157
I realized
that wasn't your fault.

23:14.658 --> 23:17.226
I hope you will give me
another chance, Lionel."

23:18.395 --> 23:20.327
"Give me another chance."

23:20.329 --> 23:21.962
That sound like
a phrase I'd use?

23:21.964 --> 23:23.197
No. Uh, not at all.

23:23.199 --> 23:25.332
But that came
from your personal email account

23:25.334 --> 23:27.301
and there was a key
waiting for me downstairs

23:27.303 --> 23:30.003
- at the front desk, so...
- Well, she probably thought

23:30.005 --> 23:31.140
she was helping you.

23:33.942 --> 23:36.376
You really shouldn't leave
your computer open like that.

23:36.378 --> 23:39.081
I often make that mistake
in my own home.

23:39.315 --> 23:41.849
But thank you,
and, uh, you can go.

23:42.084 --> 23:43.517
A... Actually, no, uh,

23:43.519 --> 23:45.652
bring Tess here to me
and then go.

23:45.654 --> 23:47.557
But that's the problem, sir.

23:56.465 --> 23:59.368
You can't go in there.
You'd be all over TMZ.

24:06.709 --> 24:08.508
That's it.
Party's over.

24:08.510 --> 24:10.879
Fire marshal shut us down.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.315
- We got to end it.
- Hey, we should go.

24:13.549 --> 24:14.880
- Come on. We should go.
- Okay. Okay.

24:14.882 --> 24:17.084
- Let's go out the back.
- Let's keep it moving.

24:17.086 --> 24:19.220
Come on, guys.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

24:20.388 --> 24:21.724
Not gonna happen, buddy.

24:42.377 --> 24:43.642
What's up, Lionel?

24:43.644 --> 24:46.314
Gennady Vahkrov, 15D.

24:46.548 --> 24:49.148
Gennady? That's not a name.
That's a life sentence.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.952
Hey, I'm Russian.

24:51.219 --> 24:52.220
I'm sorry.

24:53.388 --> 24:56.624
Look, dude,
I'm a fan. Truly.

24:58.092 --> 24:59.693
But you can't talk to me
that way.

24:59.695 --> 25:02.330
No, dude,
then how about this way?

25:02.597 --> 25:03.598
You're a speck of trash

25:04.399 --> 25:07.533
floating on a toxic sea.
You're lost, adrift,

25:07.535 --> 25:10.536
clinging to velvet ropes,
designer drugs,

25:10.538 --> 25:13.374
club girls
with subterranean self-esteem.

25:13.742 --> 25:14.841
Your parents gave you
anything

25:14.843 --> 25:17.075
your desiccated heart
could ever want,

25:17.077 --> 25:18.310
except attention.

25:18.312 --> 25:20.379
Other people are disposable
to you because

25:20.381 --> 25:23.048
that's the thing you secretly
fear about yourself,

25:23.050 --> 25:25.453
that you have nothing to offer
except surface.

25:26.754 --> 25:29.923
Your cousin, Maxim,
he's the promoter here?

25:31.391 --> 25:32.691
Then I suggest you clear out

25:32.693 --> 25:33.925
before I call my friends
at City Hall

25:33.927 --> 25:36.430
and shut this depraved
carnival down for good.

25:45.539 --> 25:49.142
Dude, she doesn't even drink,
doesn't sit well with her genes.

25:59.286 --> 26:00.487
I thought you'd wait,

26:01.087 --> 26:03.154
I don't know, till day two,

26:03.156 --> 26:04.524
before you
pulled a stunt like this.

26:04.758 --> 26:06.026
I was...

26:06.861 --> 26:08.059
trying to make friends.

26:08.061 --> 26:10.261
The great gonad doesn't want
your friendship.

26:10.263 --> 26:11.597
I... I know what he wants.

26:11.599 --> 26:13.298
That doesn't mean
I was gonna give it to him.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.333
I don't care
what kind of gutters

26:15.335 --> 26:17.435
you crawled around in
in Tuscaloosa

26:17.437 --> 26:18.839
or wherever the hell,

26:19.473 --> 26:22.106
but while you're a guest in my
house, you will carry yourself

26:22.108 --> 26:23.477
with dignity and restraint.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.778
- Dignity and restraint?
- Yeah.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.312
Or you'll be out
on your ungrateful,

26:27.314 --> 26:28.680
trailer-hopping keister.

26:28.682 --> 26:30.751
And I don't think Mom
is taking calls these days.

26:31.318 --> 26:33.420
Hmm. Well, it was nice of you
to care.

27:04.751 --> 27:05.652
Come in.

27:10.657 --> 27:12.857
You know, you could have
just said you're sorry.

27:12.859 --> 27:13.760
I'm not.

27:14.794 --> 27:16.562
That's not a gift.
It's an advance.

27:17.830 --> 27:19.299
Advance on what?

27:20.199 --> 27:22.201
Cog, welcome to the machine.

27:22.434 --> 27:25.371
If I'm gonna extend your stay,
you're gonna earn it.

27:26.338 --> 27:28.640
Your first job is
to go through these

27:28.642 --> 27:30.643
and highlight everything
you love.

27:30.911 --> 27:32.443
Anything that makes you want to

27:32.445 --> 27:35.245
build a yurt
out of reclaimed bamboo

27:35.247 --> 27:38.350
or volunteer
on a Costa Rican wind farm,

27:38.818 --> 27:40.217
- I wanna see it.
- Right.

27:40.219 --> 27:41.287
So you can use it as fodder.

27:41.787 --> 27:42.756
Exactly.

27:45.457 --> 27:46.458
Hey, wait.

27:47.561 --> 27:48.762
Don't I get to watch you
do your show?

27:50.029 --> 27:51.361
<i>News, sports,
and weather.</i>

27:51.363 --> 27:52.730
- Happy listening.
- <i>It's OneVoice,</i>

27:52.732 --> 27:55.832
<i>where we present
The Lionel Macomb Show.</i>

27:55.834 --> 28:00.604
Uncle Sam is not your doctor.
That's not his... His job.

28:00.606 --> 28:03.774
He's... The guy's...
He's not even your uncle.

28:03.776 --> 28:06.209
<i>Well, actually,
I do have an Uncle Sam.</i>

28:06.211 --> 28:09.113
Well, that's... I'm super happy
for you. I really am.

28:10.684 --> 28:13.117
Earl Higgins.
You must be Tess?

28:13.319 --> 28:15.353
- Yeah.
- Hi.

28:15.588 --> 28:17.754
I don't know what you did
but I got to thank you, Tess.

28:17.756 --> 28:19.155
He's on fire today.

28:19.157 --> 28:20.089
<i>I can try and
explain it to him,</i>

28:20.091 --> 28:21.491
<i>but I don't think he understand</i>

28:21.493 --> 28:24.427
- <i>what to say here.</i>
- Well, Nessy, your... Your son,

28:24.429 --> 28:26.830
would he self-identify
as a member of the left?

28:26.832 --> 28:28.565
<i>I don't think so.</i>

28:28.567 --> 28:30.467
How about we, uh,
we get him on

28:30.469 --> 28:32.002
- to talk to his Uncle Lionel...
- N... No, no, no.

28:32.004 --> 28:33.369
...see if I can seek him out.

28:33.371 --> 28:34.570
Lionel, we didn't screen
the kid.

28:34.572 --> 28:35.739
Earl's warning me
not to take the bait,

28:35.741 --> 28:38.507
but Lionel Macomb
takes on all comers.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.777
This show is not a safe place
for me or anyone else.

28:40.779 --> 28:42.513
I say bring him on.
Bring them all on.

28:42.748 --> 28:44.715
<i>Okay, Lionel.
Here's Cory.</i>

28:44.717 --> 28:46.652
Hey, Cory, welcome to the show.

28:48.252 --> 28:50.121
- Cory?
- <i>Hello?</i>

28:50.656 --> 28:51.556
Uh...

28:52.423 --> 28:53.890
Cory, how old are you, son?

28:53.892 --> 28:55.828
<i>Five and three quarters.</i>

28:56.728 --> 29:01.866
Uh... Well... And your grandma,
she's not... Not too good, right?

29:02.400 --> 29:03.769
<i>You mean my wowee?</i>

29:04.536 --> 29:06.571
Yeah, your wowee.
She's, uh...

29:07.338 --> 29:09.640
She's... She's not...
Not good, yeah?

29:09.642 --> 29:10.573
<i>She's in the hospital.</i>

29:10.575 --> 29:11.643
There's a lot of people

29:13.112 --> 29:15.711
trying to make your... Your...
wowee feel better, right?

29:15.713 --> 29:18.316
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Your mom, doctors, nurses.

29:18.651 --> 29:20.184
And, um...

29:21.486 --> 29:23.722
but there are o...
Other people who've never...

29:24.288 --> 29:26.658
even met your wowee
who think they know...

29:26.858 --> 29:29.558
They know better.
Uh... government people.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.728
And... And, uh,

29:32.296 --> 29:33.963
I'll tell you a little secret
about those government people.

29:33.965 --> 29:35.299
<i>A secret?</i>

29:35.767 --> 29:37.435
They wanna kill your wowee.

29:41.907 --> 29:43.305
I think we lost him. It's okay.
You're gonna have to find out

29:43.307 --> 29:44.440
sooner or later, you know,
grannies die all the time.

29:44.442 --> 29:47.211
No matter how good
your Medicare is.

29:47.545 --> 29:49.679
<i>An iceberg
the size of Delaware</i>

29:49.681 --> 29:51.047
<i>broke off of Antarctica.</i>

29:51.049 --> 29:52.982
<i>Climate change isn't a theory,
it's a fact.</i>

29:52.984 --> 29:54.684
<i>It doesn't matter
if you care or not.</i>

29:54.686 --> 29:55.585
I care.

29:56.788 --> 29:57.620
That... That's why
I live in a penthouse.

29:57.622 --> 29:59.021
I moved to higher ground.

29:59.023 --> 30:01.290
<i>I just...</i>

30:01.292 --> 30:02.491
<i>I can't... There's no...
There's no words.</i>

30:02.493 --> 30:03.826
I gotta say this... All right.
You know,

30:03.828 --> 30:07.463
whenever an environmentalist
gets in a hissy fit,

30:07.465 --> 30:08.931
I get a warm, fuzzy
feeling inside.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.335
Does he...
Does he always do that?

30:11.536 --> 30:14.003
Sometimes he lets them sputter
for a few seconds.

30:14.005 --> 30:15.571
He likes it when they're so mad

30:15.573 --> 30:17.073
they can't form
a coherent thought.

30:17.075 --> 30:19.443
Hmm. What about bring him on?

30:20.077 --> 30:21.913
Your uncle's a heavyweight.

30:22.345 --> 30:23.712
And thousands of people

30:23.714 --> 30:25.047
who want
a turn in the ring with him,

30:25.049 --> 30:27.716
a chance to land a cheap shot
and take him down.

30:27.718 --> 30:28.852
Don't get me wrong.

30:29.519 --> 30:31.688
He can take every one of them.

30:31.889 --> 30:33.091
But that's not his job.

30:34.458 --> 30:37.994
Real fighters stop
taking punches, they get soft.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.929
- But they stay pretty.
- No, Whole Foods.

30:39.931 --> 30:42.764
That's where you buy your
goddamn political viewpoints,

30:42.766 --> 30:44.466
in a little carryout bag

30:44.468 --> 30:46.768
with your fava beans
and your hummus...

30:52.042 --> 30:52.943
Oh.

30:53.811 --> 30:55.211
- Uh. Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

30:55.213 --> 30:56.578
- Yeah. You got a little...
- There's something on my...

30:56.580 --> 30:58.680
- Something on my face?
- ...something... Can you feel it?

30:58.682 --> 30:59.616
Mm. Thank you.

31:00.684 --> 31:01.649
You should start with
your face.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.516
- What, up here?
- Yeah.

31:02.518 --> 31:05.053
Oh, God.

31:05.055 --> 31:07.021
You know, these... These things
are... Are basically foolproof.

31:07.023 --> 31:08.256
- Foolproof?
- Yeah.

31:08.258 --> 31:10.158
- Like, a toddler can use them.
- Like a toddler?

31:10.160 --> 31:11.360
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Mm.

31:12.762 --> 31:13.628
You should see them make
these itty-bitty baby lattes.

31:13.630 --> 31:14.562
- Wow.
- Pretty cute.

31:14.564 --> 31:15.597
- Do you wanna...
- Come on, move.

31:15.599 --> 31:17.700
Please.
Feel free to demonstrate.

31:19.436 --> 31:21.537
- It's an art, you see?
- Mm. Yeah, show me.

31:24.908 --> 31:26.909
Shocker.

31:27.144 --> 31:28.977
Well, that's a lot of trouble
for a cup of coffee.

31:28.979 --> 31:30.312
Yeah, well, you've never
met my boss.

31:30.613 --> 31:31.614
Grayson.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.749
Oh, you have foam in your hair.

31:35.751 --> 31:36.951
- Let me just... Yes.
- Thank you.

31:36.953 --> 31:39.020
Tess, this is
Judith Montefiore-Salters.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.721
Senior senator
of the state of New York.

31:40.723 --> 31:41.823
- And my boss.
- Yeah.

31:41.825 --> 31:43.758
Well, try saying that
ten times fast.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.728
It... It...
It's an honor to meet you.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.897
So, you're the reason it takes
ten minutes to get a macchiato.

31:49.899 --> 31:51.265
Well, without her,
it probably would've taken 20.

31:51.267 --> 31:53.801
Uh-huh. Well, I hope Grayson
wasn't bothering you.

31:53.803 --> 31:55.736
No. No. Not too much.

31:55.738 --> 31:58.741
I've never met a senator's
intern before, or a senator.

31:58.974 --> 32:00.474
And the honor is mine.

32:00.476 --> 32:01.810
You know, your Clean Slate bill,

32:01.812 --> 32:03.977
it's... It's causing a lot
of drama around here.

32:03.979 --> 32:06.547
My uncle talks about it
pretty much daily.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.551
- Good things I hope.
- Tess.

32:08.751 --> 32:12.354
At any moment was this woman
left alone with this beverage?

32:12.822 --> 32:15.155
You have to get Stanford
to taste it first.

32:15.157 --> 32:18.125
Don't worry, Lionel.
It's just a little truth serum.

32:18.127 --> 32:20.195
It'll only be fatal
to your career.

32:20.197 --> 32:22.729
Really, Judy,
has it come to this? Stalking?

32:22.731 --> 32:24.800
I was down the hall
doing Ben's show.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.701
When are you gonna let me
have a turn in the hot seat?

32:27.703 --> 32:30.737
Your show, your rules,
no preconditions?

32:30.739 --> 32:34.677
- I promise it won't hurt.
- Please, Judy. Not in public.

32:35.011 --> 32:38.045
What's the matter? Larry not
getting it done for you?

32:38.047 --> 32:39.815
You looking to add
another hyphen?

32:40.083 --> 32:42.683
Oh, God.
That's such a short walk

32:42.685 --> 32:44.484
from the playground
to the locker room.

32:44.486 --> 32:46.920
Isn't it?
You're a great talker, Lionel.

32:46.922 --> 32:48.688
Not much for listening, though.

32:48.690 --> 32:49.658
Sorry, what was that?

32:51.994 --> 32:54.430
It's nice to meet you both.

32:55.064 --> 32:56.031
Yes.

32:57.066 --> 32:58.033
I'm sorry.

32:59.201 --> 33:01.767
...not cheap,
it's toxic!

33:01.769 --> 33:04.571
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic!

33:04.573 --> 33:07.140
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic!

33:07.142 --> 33:09.712
Talk's not cheap, it's toxic!

33:09.912 --> 33:12.380
You know what, you should let
the senator on your show.

33:12.614 --> 33:13.881
It'd be good for ratings.

33:13.883 --> 33:15.815
My ratings are
perfectly healthy, thank you.

33:15.817 --> 33:17.317
I just mean, you know, maybe

33:17.319 --> 33:20.519
it would be good to break out
of your bubble a little bit.

33:20.521 --> 33:21.954
I like my bubble.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.790
It has a private jet,
cellars of Château Margaux,

33:24.792 --> 33:26.561
and heaping piles
of instant gratification.

33:27.195 --> 33:28.696
It's just a suggestion.

33:29.098 --> 33:30.696
Don't worry about me, kid.

33:30.698 --> 33:31.966
I got all the attention
I can stand.

33:48.284 --> 33:49.584
<i>Next Wednesday night.</i>

33:51.119 --> 33:54.186
<i>Joining us tonight from
New York is Gareth Whitley.</i>

33:54.188 --> 33:56.223
<i>Rising star of Talk Radio.</i>

33:56.225 --> 33:57.490
<i>Welcome, Gareth,
good to have you.</i>

33:57.492 --> 33:59.025
<i>Blessed to be here, Jane.
Thank you.</i>

33:59.027 --> 34:00.126
Mm-mm.

34:00.128 --> 34:01.295
It's like going to the doctor's,
no fun,

34:01.297 --> 34:03.796
but you still got to know
what's going on.

34:03.798 --> 34:07.066
<i>...from the flame thrower
himself, Lionel Macomb.</i>

34:07.068 --> 34:08.900
The master. None better.

34:08.902 --> 34:10.638
<i>You were his intern,</i>

34:10.871 --> 34:12.170
<i>his sidekick...</i>

34:12.172 --> 34:13.875
<i>...and his heir apparent.</i>

34:14.108 --> 34:16.275
<i>So, Gareth, what changed?</i>

34:16.277 --> 34:17.643
<i>Well, listen, Jane.</i>

34:17.645 --> 34:18.877
- <i>I owe a lot to Lionel.</i>
- Yes, you do.

34:18.879 --> 34:21.681
<i>I wouldn't be
where I am without him.</i>

34:21.683 --> 34:24.918
<i>But, you know, after a while, I
knew I had to follow my calling</i>

34:25.321 --> 34:27.353
- <i>Go my own way.</i>
- <i>Lots of people...</i>

34:27.355 --> 34:30.623
- Does he paint his teeth?
- Yes, he does.

34:30.625 --> 34:31.724
- Huh.
- And he probably

34:31.726 --> 34:32.960
bleaches his asshole.

34:34.562 --> 34:36.062
- <i>I feel very blessed.</i>
- <i>And you've talked</i>

34:36.063 --> 34:38.130
<i>about how faith and parenthood
affected your work.</i>

34:38.132 --> 34:39.197
<i>Tell us more.</i>

34:39.199 --> 34:40.902
Here comes
the frozen lake story.

34:41.268 --> 34:43.735
Three, two, one.

34:43.737 --> 34:46.737
<i>I was walking in the woods
with my daughter, Evie.</i>

34:46.739 --> 34:48.742
<i>We came upon this frozen lake.</i>

34:49.377 --> 34:51.511
<i>And Evie stopped.</i>

34:51.745 --> 34:54.045
<i>And she just stood at that lake</i>

34:54.047 --> 34:56.817
<i>staring for what must've been
two to three minutes.</i>

34:57.150 --> 34:58.618
<i>Not saying a word.</i>

34:59.153 --> 35:00.687
<i>Holding my hand.</i>

35:01.221 --> 35:03.657
<i>Watching the sun shine
on the ice.</i>

35:04.658 --> 35:05.657
<i>It was heavenly.</i>

35:05.659 --> 35:06.925
<i>I stood beside her...</i>

35:06.927 --> 35:08.995
<i>...looking at her
look at the world.</i>

35:08.997 --> 35:10.829
<i>And I remember thinking</i>

35:10.831 --> 35:13.967
<i>about the show
that I was doing with Lionel.</i>

35:15.769 --> 35:17.070
<i>And then I thought,</i>

35:18.473 --> 35:20.040
<i>"Is that really how
I wanna spend my time?"</i>

35:21.441 --> 35:22.741
<i>You know, use my voice?
Is that what I want</i>

35:22.743 --> 35:25.912
<i>my little baby girl
to see of her father?</i>

35:26.779 --> 35:29.014
<i>And in that moment,
it stopped adding up for me.</i>

35:29.016 --> 35:29.950
Mm-hmm.

35:30.183 --> 35:31.218
<i>It was time.</i>

35:32.786 --> 35:35.753
<i>Now, there's some speculation
that your meteoric rise</i>

35:35.755 --> 35:38.823
<i>has led to a falling out
with Mr. Macomb.</i>

35:38.825 --> 35:40.258
<i>No. Not at all.</i>

35:40.260 --> 35:41.693
<i>There's room for both of us
under the tent.</i>

35:41.695 --> 35:42.696
No, there's not.

35:44.231 --> 35:45.463
<i>So, what does Lionel think
about this friendly fire?</i>

35:45.465 --> 35:45.531
<i>Have you
spoken with him about it?</i>

35:46.767 --> 35:48.800
<i>You know, Jane,
I've reached out.</i>

35:48.802 --> 35:51.269
He waved.
Waving is not reaching.

35:51.271 --> 35:53.672
<i>But I have faith
that he'll come around.</i>

35:54.041 --> 35:55.940
<i>In fact, we're actually
putting on</i>

35:55.942 --> 35:57.610
<i>a little event next month.</i>

35:57.811 --> 36:00.110
<i>An old-fashioned
revival type thing</i>

36:00.112 --> 36:02.347
<i>full of good talk
and honest debate.</i>

36:02.349 --> 36:03.647
<i>It will be televised live</i>

36:03.649 --> 36:05.552
<i>in front of
a studio audience, and...</i>

36:06.787 --> 36:08.719
<i>I'm hoping
that Lionel will agree</i>

36:08.721 --> 36:10.087
<i>to be my special guest.</i>

36:10.089 --> 36:11.722
<i>So, what do you say, Lionel?</i>

36:11.724 --> 36:12.856
<i>Would you that
for an old friend?</i>

36:16.796 --> 36:18.731
Pushing the buttons works, too.

36:20.367 --> 36:22.102
What do say we get some air?

36:39.051 --> 36:43.287
<i>♪ I have something
to sing about now ♪</i>

36:43.289 --> 36:46.023
<i>♪ And I want the world to know</i>

36:46.025 --> 36:48.258
<i>♪ Just why the moon's aglow ♪</i>

36:48.260 --> 36:51.829
<i>♪ Why stars are
Waking up above ♪</i>

36:51.831 --> 36:54.934
<i>♪ I am in love ♪</i>

36:56.469 --> 37:00.039
<i>♪ I have something
To sing about now ♪</i>

37:00.873 --> 37:04.176
- <i>♪ My heart is so full... ♪</i>
- Hey! Macomb!

37:04.777 --> 37:06.909
Your ego is blocking the screen!

37:06.911 --> 37:08.714
Go home, prick!

37:09.148 --> 37:11.383
Your views
are bullshit, man!

37:14.220 --> 37:15.954
I know you can hear me,
Macomb.

37:16.754 --> 37:18.922
- Oh, bad boy's getting up.
- Lionel.

37:18.924 --> 37:20.923
- Hey! Sit down!
- Nice to meet a fan.

37:20.925 --> 37:22.226
- Shh!
- Come on!

37:22.228 --> 37:25.295
Hey, asshole, sit down!
This ain't even your show.

37:25.297 --> 37:26.530
How do you sleep at night?

37:26.532 --> 37:27.764
- Shh!
- On a mattress stuffed with cash

37:27.766 --> 37:30.434
and the broken dreams
of Hillary Clinton.

37:32.872 --> 37:35.274
You selfish prick!
Go home!

37:39.978 --> 37:45.982
<i>♪ I'm in love ♪</i>

37:45.984 --> 37:47.319
You suck, Macomb!

37:49.120 --> 37:51.989
You should've seen these jackals
trying to tell me

37:51.991 --> 37:54.092
where I can go in my city.

37:54.959 --> 37:56.362
I'll tell them
where they can go.

37:57.929 --> 37:58.694
<i>Well, now,
maybe if you treated people</i>

37:58.696 --> 37:59.931
<i>with a little respect,</i>

38:01.300 --> 38:02.633
- <i>it'd come back at you.</i>
- What? Do unto others?

38:02.635 --> 38:03.666
Nope. Never heard it.
You should trademark that.

38:03.668 --> 38:06.036
<i>You're very rude, sir.</i>

38:06.038 --> 38:07.236
<i>I'm trying to have
a genuine conversation.</i>

38:07.238 --> 38:09.572
No, Ernie.
You're coming on my show

38:09.574 --> 38:11.941
trying to teach me
about respect.

38:11.943 --> 38:14.177
Buddy, tell me, what do you know
about respect?

38:14.179 --> 38:15.945
<i>Only what
I learned during</i>

38:15.947 --> 38:17.749
<i>three tours in Afghanistan.</i>

38:19.384 --> 38:21.286
And whose side were you on?

38:28.326 --> 38:30.893
You shouldn't talk
to people that way, Lionel.

38:30.895 --> 38:31.829
Or else what?

38:32.463 --> 38:34.264
I'll be elected president?

38:34.266 --> 38:36.065
Your buddy, Ernie,
should appreciate

38:36.067 --> 38:37.168
what I do more than anyone.

38:37.435 --> 38:39.135
That's what he fought for.

38:39.137 --> 38:41.204
To come home
and get reamed at on the radio

38:41.206 --> 38:43.839
by some smug, angry, rich guy?

38:43.841 --> 38:45.776
His mission is
to defend our freedom.

38:46.244 --> 38:48.243
I'm exercising that freedom.

38:48.245 --> 38:51.149
Wow. Yeah.
They should give you a medal.

38:53.619 --> 38:54.751
They have.

38:57.221 --> 38:59.088
So, anyone can say whatever
they wanna say

38:59.090 --> 39:00.124
whenever they wanna say it?

39:01.593 --> 39:02.724
- Yes. It's called honesty.
- They were honest last night.

39:02.726 --> 39:04.193
- How'd that feel?
- That's different.

39:04.195 --> 39:07.128
In person, it's personal.
I don't go into people's homes

39:07.130 --> 39:09.131
and spit bile while they eat.

39:09.133 --> 39:11.967
- That's exactly what you do.
- They don't have to listen.

39:11.969 --> 39:14.037
No. They can always
switch over to Whitley.

39:20.010 --> 39:21.979
I seriously don't get
what Val sees in you.

39:22.347 --> 39:26.049
She is smart, funny, loyal,
successful, kind.

39:26.383 --> 39:29.918
I'm smart, funny,
and successful.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.989
Yeah. You're missing a couple
of key ingredients there.

39:32.889 --> 39:34.458
Strong women can take it.

39:35.092 --> 39:36.126
Why do you cheat?

39:38.262 --> 39:40.530
Because I'm all fucked up
deep down inside.

39:43.367 --> 39:45.768
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lionel Macomb.

39:55.479 --> 39:57.379
Lionel should get one of these.

39:57.381 --> 40:00.180
It'd go great with that
huge painting of himself.

40:02.252 --> 40:03.953
That was a birthday gift,
actually.

40:04.254 --> 40:05.288
From Lionel to Lionel.

40:06.590 --> 40:10.024
Your uncle has got
some rough edges but, you know,

40:10.026 --> 40:12.862
there's parts of him
that might surprise you.

40:13.430 --> 40:14.498
Give him time.

40:16.266 --> 40:17.332
Don't get me wrong,

40:17.334 --> 40:19.035
I appreciate
what he's doing for me.

40:20.504 --> 40:22.437
It's nice of him to let me stick
around for a few more weeks

40:22.439 --> 40:24.606
considering how much
he seems to hate me.

40:24.608 --> 40:26.241
Lionel doesn't hate you.

40:26.243 --> 40:28.275
I know,
it's my mom he can't stand.

40:28.277 --> 40:30.380
No. He doesn't hate
your mom, either.

40:30.714 --> 40:32.214
How can you tell?

40:32.616 --> 40:34.384
Because he doesn't
talk about her.

41:05.247 --> 41:07.183
Spent a lot of time
in libraries.

41:14.490 --> 41:15.491
Hey, hey.

41:16.092 --> 41:17.294
Got you something.

41:19.328 --> 41:22.399
Oh, since when are you shy?
Come on. Come on.

41:27.537 --> 41:29.138
I thought it'd be good
for your room at Harper.

41:30.573 --> 41:32.506
- How...
- Lionel did his homework.

41:32.508 --> 41:35.478
We know your blood type,
your first crush.

41:36.044 --> 41:38.514
Harper is a wonderful school.
You'll be very happy there.

41:39.181 --> 41:40.616
Yeah. I'm sure I would be.

41:41.752 --> 41:43.085
What? You're not gonna go?

41:43.519 --> 41:44.553
Mm...

41:45.220 --> 41:47.189
I don't know. I want to. But...

41:47.790 --> 41:48.990
Your mom?

41:50.225 --> 41:52.326
- She doesn't want you to go?
- No, she does.

41:52.328 --> 41:54.427
You should've seen her
the day that I got in. She...

41:54.429 --> 41:57.899
She started making
these guttural shrieking noises,

41:58.334 --> 42:00.368
like an angry dolphin
or something, but...

42:00.703 --> 42:02.770
in a totally thrilled
and proud way.

42:02.772 --> 42:05.508
Mm. That's the problem
with dolphin noises.

42:13.749 --> 42:14.949
We made a deal.

42:15.618 --> 42:17.118
My mom gets help.

42:18.086 --> 42:20.456
She actually sees it through
this time.

42:21.690 --> 42:23.224
Then I'll go to Harper.

42:25.661 --> 42:27.228
I mean, I wanna go...

42:28.229 --> 42:29.698
more than anything.

42:30.298 --> 42:33.701
- But first I need to know...
- She's okay.

42:38.740 --> 42:41.309
Please don't tell Lionel.
He would never understand.

42:42.710 --> 42:44.613
Well...

42:45.313 --> 42:47.380
- your mom's getting help, right?
- Yeah.

42:47.382 --> 42:50.084
Yeah.
So, there's nothing to tell.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.254
Sounds like you made
a good deal.

42:54.756 --> 42:55.956
Yeah.

42:58.393 --> 43:00.726
Well, then we can move on
to more important things

43:00.728 --> 43:03.162
like where are we
going to have lunch?

43:03.164 --> 43:05.400
I'm starving.

43:30.357 --> 43:33.227
I once had someone deported
for looking into that picture.

43:33.528 --> 43:35.062
And he was from Maine.

43:35.529 --> 43:37.131
You look happy.

43:42.337 --> 43:43.303
I wasn't.

43:45.539 --> 43:48.242
Uh, we were supposed to
go to Mount Rushmore.

43:48.542 --> 43:49.443
Uh...

43:50.778 --> 43:52.379
It was stupid, but
I was... I was dying to see it.

43:52.780 --> 43:53.880
So, one day your grandmother

43:53.882 --> 43:56.049
piles me and your mother
into the car.

43:56.484 --> 43:58.719
I ask her where we're going
and she just smiles.

43:59.319 --> 44:00.421
Two days later,

44:01.455 --> 44:02.723
you know where we end up?

44:03.257 --> 44:04.725
Ossineke, Michigan.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.593
Surprise.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.530
Instead of Mount Rushmore,
I got Dinosaur Gardens.

44:10.865 --> 44:12.731
There was a guy she wanted
to see in Rogers City.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.601
So, it worked out great.

44:16.270 --> 44:17.571
So, why the smile?

44:20.240 --> 44:21.542
The smile was not for her.

44:26.380 --> 44:28.047
My mom took this.

44:28.649 --> 44:30.617
She used to take pictures
of everything.

44:33.486 --> 44:36.321
Like our life was this big,
important exhibit

44:36.323 --> 44:37.290
she was curating.

44:37.958 --> 44:41.258
Kept them all in
a busted-up shoe box,

44:41.260 --> 44:42.763
called her family album.

44:43.195 --> 44:44.231
But, uh...

44:44.731 --> 44:45.764
you have her camera now,

44:45.766 --> 44:48.100
so I'm guessing
she gave that up.

44:51.905 --> 44:53.440
Does she still
have the pictures?

44:56.944 --> 45:00.444
Mm. Well, that's
a warm, fuzzy memory

45:00.446 --> 45:01.681
to keep tucked away
in your desk.

45:02.348 --> 45:04.083
Well, that's what
families are for.

45:04.751 --> 45:06.684
They remind you of
all the things you...

45:06.686 --> 45:09.388
secretly hate and fear
about yourself.

45:09.990 --> 45:13.560
Wow. I can't wait to get
your Christmas card.

45:14.460 --> 45:16.262
That was an important day
for me.

45:18.264 --> 45:20.466
That was the day I learned
who I could really count on.

45:21.767 --> 45:24.136
If you're lucky, you'll have
a day like that, too.

45:24.370 --> 45:25.805
Yeah, I've had plenty.

45:26.505 --> 45:27.574
Not enough.

45:28.909 --> 45:30.576
Now, get out of my chair.

45:36.817 --> 45:39.817
Judy the Hyphen is begging
to come on my show

45:39.819 --> 45:41.552
to yammer about Clean Slate.

45:41.554 --> 45:43.255
She is getting desperate,
I'm telling you.

45:43.489 --> 45:44.922
Something must be missing
at home.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.526
<i>Stay tuned for
The Lionel Macomb Show</i>

45:49.528 --> 45:50.695
<i>after these messages.</i>

45:50.697 --> 45:51.829
Why do you always do that?

45:51.831 --> 45:53.464
You can't just
talk about her ideas?

45:53.466 --> 45:54.565
You gotta hit the fact that

45:54.567 --> 45:55.300
she's a woman
having those ideas?

45:56.469 --> 45:58.802
She... She is a woman. Isn't she?

45:58.804 --> 46:01.505
She's a ranking member of
the Senate Judiciary Committee.

46:01.507 --> 46:02.606
It's insulting.

46:02.608 --> 46:03.774
It's like, "Isn't this cute,

46:03.776 --> 46:05.645
she's walking around
in Daddy's shoes."

46:06.013 --> 46:08.277
What would you know
about Daddy's shoes?

46:08.279 --> 46:09.445
See? You're getting nasty

46:09.447 --> 46:11.350
'cause you can't handle
an actual debate.

46:16.656 --> 46:17.657
No?

46:19.091 --> 46:22.625
Hi, folks. Please welcome
to the show my niece, Tess.

46:22.627 --> 46:25.963
You'll have to excuse her.
She's 16 and female.

46:25.965 --> 46:27.265
Say hi, Tess.

46:27.732 --> 46:28.733
No.

46:30.002 --> 46:31.904
Come on, Tess.
This... This is your big shot.

46:33.806 --> 46:36.708
You want an actual debate.
This is your chance.

46:38.944 --> 46:40.110
Hi.

46:40.112 --> 46:42.947
Tess would like to offer
a tearful defense

46:43.449 --> 46:44.784
for these Clean Slate kids.

46:45.084 --> 46:47.917
Tell us, o young and wise one,

46:47.919 --> 46:51.289
why they deserve to be rewarded
for breaking the law?

46:51.790 --> 46:54.259
They didn't break the law,
their parents did.

46:54.492 --> 46:56.492
Then they should take it up
with their parents,

46:56.494 --> 46:58.729
- not the federal government.
- They are just kids.

46:58.731 --> 47:01.399
They've got nowhere to go.
Put yourself in their shoes.

47:01.666 --> 47:03.733
I didn't know they had shoes.

47:03.735 --> 47:04.636
You know,

47:05.970 --> 47:07.302
you're missing a great
opportunity here, Lionel.

47:07.304 --> 47:08.404
You should just use this bill
as a Trojan horse.

47:08.406 --> 47:10.139
You should offer them
citizenship,

47:10.141 --> 47:11.206
get them to come forward

47:11.208 --> 47:12.408
then just round them up
and deport them.

47:12.410 --> 47:14.479
That would be
a real clean slate, right?

47:16.114 --> 47:18.614
I like that idea.

47:18.616 --> 47:20.284
You remind me of me.

47:20.785 --> 47:23.020
You just ambushed me
in front of a million people.

47:23.022 --> 47:25.021
I ambushed you in front
of three million people.

47:25.023 --> 47:26.689
Whatever happened
to straight talk?

47:26.691 --> 47:27.957
People don't want straight talk.

47:27.959 --> 47:29.892
They want memes, soundbites.

47:29.894 --> 47:33.298
Hyper-articulated divination
of the noise inside their heads.

47:33.565 --> 47:36.466
Nobody wears a T-shirt
saying "I love nuance".

47:36.468 --> 47:38.835
Right. And you just sit back
and fan the flames.

47:38.837 --> 47:41.537
I shape the conversation,
think it's easy doing what I do?

47:41.539 --> 47:42.939
What do you do Lionel,
really?

47:42.941 --> 47:46.143
For three hours a day,
I give people a sense of power

47:46.145 --> 47:47.579
in a cruel
and indifferent world.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.613
And how long have you've been
offering this magnificent power?

47:50.615 --> 47:51.714
Twenty-one years.

47:51.716 --> 47:53.682
And have things gotten
any better?

47:53.684 --> 47:54.685
They have for me.

47:56.087 --> 47:56.819
Have you ever changed
anyone's mind about anything?

47:56.821 --> 47:58.553
Don't know. Don't care.

47:58.555 --> 47:59.957
Have you ever changed your mind?

48:00.158 --> 48:01.423
Never had to.

48:01.425 --> 48:03.525
Have you ever thought
about the possibility

48:03.527 --> 48:06.996
for just one second
that you might be wrong?

48:06.998 --> 48:08.097
I was only wrong once,

48:08.099 --> 48:09.966
and that's when
I thought I was wrong,

48:09.968 --> 48:11.803
but it turned out I was right.

48:12.137 --> 48:13.637
You are so damaged.

48:14.037 --> 48:16.406
And you always have to
have the last word.

48:17.108 --> 48:18.909
Wait,
you just had the last word.

48:24.649 --> 48:26.681
That... It's unfair.
It's a perfect shutdown.

48:26.683 --> 48:28.550
There's nothing I can say.
If I answer you win.

48:28.552 --> 48:29.821
If I shut up you also win.

48:44.002 --> 48:45.567
You must still be mad at me.

48:45.569 --> 48:47.503
You barely touched
your fifth plate.

48:48.939 --> 48:49.907
Where's Lorenzo?

48:51.407 --> 48:52.675
I told him you said he could
have the rest of the day off.

49:02.486 --> 49:04.555
You live in my home,
eat my food,

49:05.122 --> 49:08.659
go to work into my office
in clothes I bought you.

49:09.159 --> 49:11.892
You may not respect
what I do but, uh,

49:11.894 --> 49:14.597
you got to admit,
it has its perks.

50:07.650 --> 50:09.018
She looks so small.

50:10.720 --> 50:12.987
She is small.
It's her mouth that's huge.

50:17.827 --> 50:19.161
She's getting to you.

51:10.745 --> 51:12.645
I can't get over how
quiet it is here.

51:12.647 --> 51:15.517
You're okay with that?

51:15.917 --> 51:17.786
- I don't know.
- Not really, right?

51:18.586 --> 51:20.088
I could start howling for you?

51:21.356 --> 51:23.892
Yeah, I think I'd like that.

51:29.631 --> 51:31.833
Everybody I wanna talk to
is right here.

51:42.110 --> 51:44.844
Kent? You're supposed to be
on vacation.

51:44.846 --> 51:46.848
Talking to me is not vacation.

51:53.822 --> 51:56.658
Okay. Thank you.

52:00.128 --> 52:01.262
What is it?
What happened?

52:02.496 --> 52:03.929
Laurie checked out of rehab
last Thursday.

52:03.931 --> 52:04.833
Two weeks early.

52:05.734 --> 52:06.735
Boyd has no idea where she is.

52:11.239 --> 52:14.776
Okay. You know what, don't,
um... Don't tell Tess yet.

52:16.211 --> 52:17.343
Not until we figure this out.

52:17.345 --> 52:19.112
And certainly not
when you're angry.

52:19.114 --> 52:20.547
I'm always angry.

52:21.249 --> 52:22.647
You're saying I should
lie to Tess

52:22.649 --> 52:23.749
so I don't hurt her feelings?

52:23.751 --> 52:24.951
No. I'm not saying...
Well, I just...

52:24.953 --> 52:27.087
You know, do what you do,
just spin it.

52:30.858 --> 52:32.726
Kent thinks we should try
for emancipation.

52:33.293 --> 52:34.828
We'd have to stick it out
for the summer,

52:36.297 --> 52:37.931
but, after that, she'd be
on her own and off to school.

52:42.736 --> 52:45.005
- She won't go.
- What do you mean she won't go?

52:45.806 --> 52:48.609
I mean, they made a deal.

52:49.444 --> 52:52.778
Tess will only go to Harper
if her mom is in a good place.

52:52.780 --> 52:53.812
I promised
I wouldn't say anything,

52:53.814 --> 52:55.315
she didn't think
you'd understand.

52:55.816 --> 52:58.151
No. Because I'm a sane person.

52:58.153 --> 52:59.851
And who gives a shit
if they had a deal?

52:59.853 --> 53:00.952
Laurie clearly doesn't.

53:00.954 --> 53:02.723
She's broken every deal
she ever made.

53:05.459 --> 53:06.559
Lionel.

53:07.861 --> 53:08.862
I'm gonna tell
that girl to go to school.

53:15.335 --> 53:17.071
I thought you said lost those?

53:18.739 --> 53:20.207
No. These are mine.

53:21.241 --> 53:23.977
And, by the way,
I didn't lose anything.

53:28.982 --> 53:31.317
Late last year,
we were crashing in Marfa

53:31.319 --> 53:34.021
with this asshole,
Doug Peppers.

53:35.322 --> 53:36.456
One night, my mom woke me up

53:36.458 --> 53:38.225
and said that
we had to leave fast.

53:39.692 --> 53:42.162
And we were halfway to town
before she realized that...

53:42.930 --> 53:44.831
she left the box
underneath his bed.

53:46.333 --> 53:49.267
And I knew it was bad
because she would not go back.

53:49.269 --> 53:50.604
Not even for that.

53:53.173 --> 53:54.240
It was our whole history.

53:57.844 --> 53:59.645
Trust me.
You're better off without it.

54:17.396 --> 54:19.699
Hey, you...
You okay there, Lionel?

54:21.267 --> 54:22.869
Come on.
What are we doing in here?

54:23.302 --> 54:25.638
Let's go kick some people
off my private beach.

54:29.809 --> 54:31.876
Hey. Uh,
you've got a call on two,

54:31.878 --> 54:33.946
because apparently
I take calls for you now.

54:35.281 --> 54:36.215
Mom?

54:40.920 --> 54:41.820
Hi.

54:43.156 --> 54:44.188
Oh. You have to go.
Harper's an amazing school.

54:44.190 --> 54:46.825
- You went there?
- Uh, no. Andover.

54:47.326 --> 54:49.059
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

54:49.061 --> 54:50.860
Is that where you became
the bright-eyed,

54:50.862 --> 54:53.230
congressional coffee making
idealist you are today?

54:53.232 --> 54:56.033
Uh, well, growing up, my uh,
house was sort of

54:56.035 --> 54:58.402
negatively charged,
my parents are both lobbyists.

54:58.404 --> 54:59.937
And, uh, they'd spend their days

54:59.939 --> 55:01.272
working the Hill
for Big Tobacco,

55:01.274 --> 55:03.675
then they'd come home
and tell me not to smoke.

55:04.310 --> 55:05.942
It was a comfortable life,
but, uh,

55:05.944 --> 55:07.077
eventually I realized
I want to work

55:07.079 --> 55:09.182
for something
I really believed in.

55:13.386 --> 55:15.419
You're not gonna use
that thing on me, are you?

55:20.158 --> 55:22.794
- You like photography.
- I like history.

55:25.297 --> 55:29.366
Whenever my, uh... My mom and I
moved somewhere new,

55:29.368 --> 55:31.368
there'd always be
something like that.

55:31.370 --> 55:33.738
You know,
an old movie theater or...

55:34.339 --> 55:36.275
a memorial in town square.

55:36.542 --> 55:37.740
Nothing is permanent,

55:37.742 --> 55:39.778
but some things
last longer than you think.

55:40.312 --> 55:42.479
Stuff like that always
made me feel at home.

55:42.481 --> 55:43.815
Even if I wasn't.

55:49.221 --> 55:50.354
Hey!

55:50.356 --> 55:52.523
- Ooh!
- No! That's not fair.

55:52.525 --> 55:53.990
- What?
- You didn't warn me.

55:53.992 --> 55:56.493
- Of course I did.
- No. I'm gonna look ridiculous.

55:56.495 --> 55:58.595
No, you look great.
You may look a little blue,

55:58.597 --> 56:00.765
- a little hint of magenta.
- Hmm.

56:16.014 --> 56:17.015
How was lunch?

56:18.250 --> 56:19.985
- Hey, does he... Does...
- Relax. He doesn't know.

56:21.919 --> 56:23.486
For someone who seems
to cringe at my presence,

56:23.488 --> 56:25.321
you pay an awful lot of
attention to me.

56:25.323 --> 56:27.557
- Well, it's my job.
- To babysit?

56:27.559 --> 56:30.526
To protect Lionel from the petty
annoyances of everyday life.

56:30.528 --> 56:32.060
But if you think you need
a babysitter,

56:32.062 --> 56:33.496
he'll probably ask me
to do that, too.

56:33.498 --> 56:34.931
I don't see
what you have against me,

56:34.933 --> 56:35.998
I got you your job back.

56:36.000 --> 56:36.967
You got me fired.

56:38.637 --> 56:39.937
Call it even?

56:41.105 --> 56:42.437
Sure. Yeah.
Call it whatever you want.

56:42.439 --> 56:46.576
Just, uh... be careful with
that Grayson kid. Okay?

56:46.578 --> 56:49.279
That shy smile
and that helpful little squint.

56:49.281 --> 56:52.682
I've seen that smile before.
And it works, too.

56:52.684 --> 56:55.052
But... what's it working toward?

56:57.121 --> 56:59.121
You're spending way too much
time around Lionel.

56:59.123 --> 57:01.091
Oh, yeah. Definitely. Yeah.
It's a problem.

57:02.394 --> 57:05.193
Whitley can work his side of
the street, I'll work mine.

57:05.195 --> 57:07.463
Whitley's peeping over
your side of the street.

57:07.465 --> 57:10.499
Overall, we're down
28 percent since June.

57:10.501 --> 57:12.602
- More in major markets.
- You need to show him

57:12.604 --> 57:13.636
you still got some fight in you.

57:13.638 --> 57:15.139
We're running out of time,
Lionel.

57:16.541 --> 57:17.674
If it's about my deal,
don't worry, I can take less.

57:17.676 --> 57:20.108
- I'm not talking about money.
- I am.

57:20.110 --> 57:22.212
- I'm talking about irrelevance.
- Go on his show.

57:25.382 --> 57:27.552
Whitley's show, his revival
thing, you should do it.

57:28.352 --> 57:31.153
All right, that... That...
That's a high noon scenario.

57:31.155 --> 57:32.423
Only one person walks away.

57:32.724 --> 57:34.156
And you're saying
it won't be me?

57:34.158 --> 57:37.259
Whitley didn't invite you
because he wants you to show up,

57:37.261 --> 57:38.996
he invited you
because he thinks you won't.

57:39.229 --> 57:41.165
You get in the ring,
he's already wrong.

57:41.666 --> 57:42.966
Prove him wrong.

57:45.704 --> 57:46.837
Get out of here.

57:57.348 --> 57:58.615
I'll never
get used to that.

57:59.616 --> 58:00.984
It's good to be back.

58:02.186 --> 58:04.087
Nice of you
to cross the street.

58:04.488 --> 58:07.924
Hmm. Well, I do what I can
for old friends.

58:08.491 --> 58:10.359
You know, it's been
a really tough summer.

58:10.361 --> 58:12.429
And I hope we could both
rise above it.

58:13.229 --> 58:15.464
We got the chance to do
something really exciting here.

58:15.466 --> 58:19.334
Oh, sure. Uh, if I do this,
I'm billed as co-host,

58:19.336 --> 58:22.338
not special guest.
I sign off on all publicity.

58:22.639 --> 58:24.673
Talking points
to be set in advance.

58:24.675 --> 58:27.742
- No straying, no surprises.
- Fine by me.

58:27.744 --> 58:30.345
I have approval
of lighting and set design.

58:30.347 --> 58:32.279
No God-rays,

58:32.281 --> 58:35.249
no scripture, no stained-glass.
This isn't The Revival.

58:35.251 --> 58:37.184
Yeah, but for your sake,
you better hope it is.

58:37.186 --> 58:38.787
- There he is.
- Is there anything else

58:38.789 --> 58:39.954
you wanna do on my show?

58:39.956 --> 58:43.425
Oh, horns poking out
beneath his halo.

58:43.427 --> 58:45.359
You know,
I know you don't realize this,

58:45.361 --> 58:47.330
but I'm actually trying
to do you a favor here.

58:48.732 --> 58:49.999
See you on the air.

58:51.734 --> 58:53.236
Would you get me a coffee?

59:02.546 --> 59:03.546
Excuse me.

59:04.680 --> 59:05.681
Come here.

59:10.386 --> 59:12.488
A young man left this for you.

59:18.728 --> 59:20.430
Here's to things
that last.

59:25.200 --> 59:26.500
Scissors!

59:26.502 --> 59:28.502
How romantic.

59:28.504 --> 59:29.472
Aw.

59:30.841 --> 59:32.108
Now I know what to get my wife
for our anniversary.

59:33.342 --> 59:34.976
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

59:36.679 --> 59:39.448
Yes, that's Marfa, Texas.

59:41.083 --> 59:42.218
I know. I'm sorry.

59:43.486 --> 59:45.721
Thank you, Boyd... um, if...

59:47.289 --> 59:50.424
If there's anything I can do
to make it up to you,

59:50.426 --> 59:52.091
be sure to let me know.

59:52.093 --> 59:53.094
You want...

59:56.666 --> 59:59.569
Boyd, I... I really...
I really don't think I'm...

59:59.802 --> 01:00:01.537
best man material.

01:00:02.637 --> 01:00:05.675
I... Can't I...
Can't I just pay you?

01:00:06.374 --> 01:00:08.343
Okay. Thanks, buddy.

01:00:10.145 --> 01:00:11.146
That was weird.

01:00:11.546 --> 01:00:12.547
What is this?

01:00:13.548 --> 01:00:15.883
That is none of your business.

01:00:15.885 --> 01:00:18.651
It's an emancipation
request with my name on it.

01:00:18.653 --> 01:00:20.520
It seems like it is my business.

01:00:20.522 --> 01:00:22.157
Well, technically, yes.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.729
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, Lionel, but...

01:00:28.498 --> 01:00:30.263
I don't need that,
I've got my mom.

01:00:30.265 --> 01:00:32.501
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you got a deal, right?

01:00:38.273 --> 01:00:39.639
She gets out next Friday,

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:41.643
she'll come up for me,
and then I'll go to school.

01:00:41.843 --> 01:00:43.411
Does she know you're here?

01:00:44.479 --> 01:00:46.245
What if I just sent you packing?

01:00:46.247 --> 01:00:47.815
Well, maybe she
had more faith in you.

01:00:47.817 --> 01:00:49.349
Well, then she's
as delusional as you are.

01:00:49.351 --> 01:00:50.583
You don't even know her anymore.

01:00:50.585 --> 01:00:52.752
I don't need to.
I had a mother just like her.

01:00:52.754 --> 01:00:54.122
They are the undertow.

01:00:55.624 --> 01:00:56.791
By the time you realize you're
drowning, it's already too late.

01:00:57.292 --> 01:00:58.791
Get out now while you still can.

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:01.794
Maybe I don't wanna be somebody
who just looks out for myself.

01:01:01.796 --> 01:01:03.465
Well, if you don't,
no one else will.

01:01:04.533 --> 01:01:05.734
Laurie sure as hell won't.

01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:09.136
You've got all of this.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:10.471
She has nothing.

01:01:11.773 --> 01:01:13.475
You won, and yet you still
walk around like this...

01:01:13.675 --> 01:01:14.741
pissed off little kid

01:01:14.743 --> 01:01:16.776
with your stupid
dinosaur mug screaming,

01:01:16.778 --> 01:01:18.279
"Remember my pain."

01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:20.479
Why are you still so angry,
Lionel?

01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:21.816
Why can't you just let it go?

01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:29.823
You like pictures, right?

01:01:32.493 --> 01:01:35.830
Let me tear you a page
from the family album. Uh...

01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:39.733
Pelahatchie, Mississippi, 1981.

01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:41.468
I'm a sophomore.

01:01:41.937 --> 01:01:44.572
Your mother is 17-years-old.

01:01:44.872 --> 01:01:47.841
And our mother is shacked up
with Roy Meloy.

01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:52.244
Roy's hobbies included flicking
lit Pall Malls in my face

01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:54.513
while I'm doing my homework,
and ogling Laurie

01:01:54.515 --> 01:01:55.682
like she's next up

01:01:55.684 --> 01:01:57.718
once he decides
to trade in the old model.

01:01:57.985 --> 01:01:59.519
Laurie decides to cut loose,

01:01:59.521 --> 01:02:01.286
she asked me
if I wanna join her.

01:02:01.288 --> 01:02:04.458
I'm scared but I say,
"I'm in. I'm all in."

01:02:04.726 --> 01:02:05.793
So, we make a plan.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:07.492
Laurie's boyfriend has a car.

01:02:07.494 --> 01:02:09.630
She has a friend in Austin
who can put us up.

01:02:10.364 --> 01:02:12.296
I flip burgers all summer

01:02:12.298 --> 01:02:15.402
and put every last greasy buck
into our escape fund.

01:02:15.703 --> 01:02:16.737
We're gonna get a lawyer.

01:02:18.237 --> 01:02:19.673
I do the paperwork, find me
a place to finish high school.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.740
Finally, the big day comes,

01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:23.742
we're supposed to meet
at 6:00 a.m.

01:02:23.744 --> 01:02:25.813
in the lot behind in the school.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.516
I wait there for four hours.

01:02:31.752 --> 01:02:33.253
I finally go home.

01:02:33.787 --> 01:02:35.388
I'm still expecting
Laurie to be there.

01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:40.426
I'm thinking maybe I...
Somehow, I... I... I got confused.

01:02:41.527 --> 01:02:43.330
And I look in my bag
and the money's gone.

01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:45.264
And so is Laurie.

01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:48.234
She didn't even leave a note.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:50.768
I had to stay in that hellhole
for two more years

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:52.840
before I could
work my way out for good.

01:02:53.807 --> 01:02:55.408
That was a long time ago.

01:03:00.713 --> 01:03:03.316
Your mom checked out of
the center six days ago, Tess.

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:06.620
What? She didn't tell you?

01:03:08.354 --> 01:03:09.822
She left, again.

01:03:10.857 --> 01:03:12.358
She always leaves.

01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:18.798
You're cruel.

01:03:24.003 --> 01:03:25.538
It runs in the family.

01:03:29.609 --> 01:03:30.644
Will you leave?

01:03:33.813 --> 01:03:35.479
I have to
wait for my mom.

01:03:35.481 --> 01:03:37.450
I know
what you're thinking, but...

01:03:38.451 --> 01:03:40.888
it's different with me, I'm
the only one she's never left.

01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:44.454
What about Harper?

01:03:44.456 --> 01:03:45.656
I mean, I know it's not like

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:46.824
the emotional focal point
at the moment,

01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:48.761
but, I don't know,
maybe you can still go?

01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:52.732
Yeah, maybe.

01:03:55.468 --> 01:03:56.534
Look, there's still hope.

01:03:56.536 --> 01:03:58.368
All you know
is what Lionel told you.

01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:59.704
And he's
a professional fear-monger,

01:03:59.706 --> 01:04:01.505
you know he only said that stuff
because he's scared.

01:04:01.507 --> 01:04:02.940
- What? Of me?
- Of you.

01:04:02.942 --> 01:04:05.578
Of Whitley. Of... Of everything.

01:04:07.013 --> 01:04:08.578
Standing on an iceberg,
breathing fire,

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.716
wondering why he's sinking.

01:04:10.116 --> 01:04:11.749
I mean, Lionel's way too angry.

01:04:11.751 --> 01:04:13.216
You're not angry enough,
get angry!

01:04:13.218 --> 01:04:16.020
Okay. If he can't handle me,
Whitley is gonna eat him alive.

01:04:16.022 --> 01:04:17.456
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

01:04:19.826 --> 01:04:22.661
Lionel can say the most
subhuman things and I...

01:04:23.996 --> 01:04:25.695
I... I still can't decide
if I just...

01:04:25.697 --> 01:04:27.666
I wanna save him
from himself or...

01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:31.703
if I wanna wave a giant fan
while he goes down in flames.

01:04:36.775 --> 01:04:37.844
How about both?

01:04:48.487 --> 01:04:50.722
Talk... Talk's not cheap,
it's toxic.

01:04:50.922 --> 01:04:53.992
Talk's not cheap, it's...
Remember that, it's toxic, guys.

01:04:59.531 --> 01:05:01.868
Oh, there are a few last-minute
tweaks. I hope you don't mind.

01:05:02.467 --> 01:05:04.436
Quiet, please.
We're live in five...

01:05:04.636 --> 01:05:05.802
- Good luck.
- ...four...

01:05:05.804 --> 01:05:07.405
- Go fuck yourself.
- ...three...

01:05:07.739 --> 01:05:08.740
two...

01:05:09.141 --> 01:05:10.339
one.

01:05:13.812 --> 01:05:14.780
Hey!

01:05:16.014 --> 01:05:19.951
Hey. Hey, guys.
Thank you so much. Wonderful.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.818
Wonderful, wonderful.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.321
Thank you.
You guys, please!

01:05:24.622 --> 01:05:26.658
I feel you all, right here.

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:29.961
Woo. Okay. Incredible.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:32.597
Welcome, friends.

01:05:33.131 --> 01:05:34.999
We're so glad you could join us.

01:05:35.567 --> 01:05:37.736
Glad... and humbled.

01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:39.968
Glad you could join me, too,
my friend.

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.073
- The pleasure's all yours.
- It truly is.

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:43.939
How about another
round of applause

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.944
for the legendary Lionel Macomb.

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:50.715
Come on.
Let's hear it a little bit more.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.886
Now, Lionel and I have gone
our separate ways,

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.755
but we've come together today
because we believe

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:00.558
we're a part of something bigger
than ourselves.

01:06:00.926 --> 01:06:03.761
We may not agree on everything,
but in division,

01:06:04.196 --> 01:06:05.429
we become weak.

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:06.964
We lose focus.

01:06:07.665 --> 01:06:09.498
- The flock strays.
- Sure,

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.167
if you think of yourselves
as sheep.

01:06:11.169 --> 01:06:12.901
You know, in many ways,

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:14.772
we're farther apart
than we've ever been.

01:06:15.207 --> 01:06:16.640
Left and right.

01:06:17.174 --> 01:06:18.542
Rich and poor.

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.946
The faithful and the doubtful.

01:06:23.047 --> 01:06:25.482
We can't survive
in an echo chamber, people.

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:29.020
So, in the spirit of
reconciliation,

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.889
I'd like to welcome
a very special guest.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:33.889
The senior senator
from New York,

01:06:33.891 --> 01:06:35.893
Judith Montefiore-Salters.

01:06:36.861 --> 01:06:38.929
Come on, people,
let's show her our spirit.

01:06:40.798 --> 01:06:42.566
Keep it going.
Keep it going for Judith.

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:46.803
Come here, Judith.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:47.938
Thank you.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.242
Gentlemen...

01:06:53.244 --> 01:06:55.877
It's unconscionable.
How can you relate to be...

01:06:55.879 --> 01:06:58.280
These are human beings,
when you tell these kids

01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:00.516
to go back home, that's...
That's... That's...

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.918
Cleveland, that's Dallas,
that's Queens.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.020
This is their country, too,
and yet, you would deprive them

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.991
of their basic rights
and opportunities.

01:07:08.993 --> 01:07:10.691
Rights they're not entitled to,

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.628
opportunities
they don't deserve.

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:15.297
I'd like to believe we could
stick to our time-honored values

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:16.934
of hard work and accountability

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.234
and save a little room
for compassion.

01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:22.536
Compassion? Isn't that the name
of the Sri Lankan housemaid

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:24.674
you got working up
at your chalet in Vale?

01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:29.010
Folks...

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:32.082
You benefited from opportunity,
Lionel.

01:07:32.283 --> 01:07:35.182
From the hard work
and generosity of others.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:37.652
We... We all did,
that's how we got here.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.656
Oh, that's how
you got here, I... I...

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:41.756
owe nothing
because I came from nothing.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:43.658
I... I fought, I clawed.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.860
Oh, o... Of course.

01:07:44.862 --> 01:07:46.928
Everything you got,
you earned yourself.

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.731
And everything I got
was given to me.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.699
Probably by a man.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:54.702
I don't... I don't know
how you got where you are,

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:57.140
Judith, it's not a place
I'd brag about being either.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.941
I'm here because I said

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:01.609
the things
that needed to be said.

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:02.910
But people need
something different now.

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.814
Right. And you're the guy
to give it to them.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:07.850
Well, if they let me,
I'm gonna try.

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:12.854
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Gareth.

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:16.357
Because anybody out here
who is really listening,

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.326
knows that you're singing
the same songs

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:20.761
your old friend, Lionel,
just in a different key.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:23.265
Haven't you heard, Judy,
Gareth here has seen the light.

01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:24.932
Yeah, I've known this man
a long time.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.200
The only light he's ever seen

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.935
is the one that blinks
when the camera is on.

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.176
I'm worried about you, Lionel.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.113
The people who love you,
they're worried, too.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.919
This anger, this vitriol.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.152
It's bad for the soul.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.252
Oh, that old thing,

01:08:46.254 --> 01:08:48.721
I sold that
a half-a-lifetime ago,

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:51.624
but, uh, now
I can play me a mean guitar.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.031
Well, then,
I'll give you this, my friend.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.568
These are fearful times.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:04.006
And you understand fear
better than just about anyone

01:09:04.872 --> 01:09:07.243
and that understanding
doesn't come easy.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:10.812
You learned it as a kid.

01:09:12.714 --> 01:09:14.080
A kid who hid in the backseat,

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.381
every time his mom
went to the bank

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:17.652
to cash her welfare check.

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:20.889
A kid who was so ashamed he
couldn't pay for school lunch,

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.156
he would wait until
the cafeteria was empty

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.790
and grabbed his tray.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:27.794
A kid who felt left down
and left behind

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.532
by the very people
who were supposed to love him.

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.968
His poor, troubled mother.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.238
God rest her soul.

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:36.439
And his own sister...

01:09:37.906 --> 01:09:40.709
who abandoned him
in a parking lot.

01:09:42.978 --> 01:09:46.412
You know, I think underneath
all your bravado,

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:48.883
you've always been
that scared little kid

01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:52.152
and right now,
you're downright terrified.

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:55.957
You thought you had a movement,
but all you had was a moment.

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:59.728
You've got a unique opportunity
here, Lionel.

01:10:00.728 --> 01:10:02.730
To remember where you came from,

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:04.933
to go a different way.

01:10:06.934 --> 01:10:09.271
That was really...
That was really beautiful.

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:10.836
- Gareth, really.
- Thank you.

01:10:10.838 --> 01:10:14.474
So, so heartfelt,
I actually almost believed it.

01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:18.077
That must be why you guys
love Whitley so much

01:10:18.079 --> 01:10:18.814
because you can sit here
and listen to him

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.615
remake God in his own image.

01:10:21.882 --> 01:10:24.685
- That's not true.
- Well, I got news for you.

01:10:24.885 --> 01:10:25.986
Whitley doesn't care about you.

01:10:27.455 --> 01:10:29.355
No one on the stage gives a damn
about you or your problems.

01:10:29.357 --> 01:10:31.190
If we actually fix them,

01:10:31.192 --> 01:10:32.861
we'd have
nothing to argue about.

01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:34.129
We're all playing you.

01:10:35.329 --> 01:10:36.661
We get rich and powerful
by yanking your strings

01:10:36.663 --> 01:10:39.432
and you're dumb enough
to bow down and lap it up.

01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:41.766
That is
awfully cynical, Lionel.

01:10:41.768 --> 01:10:44.437
This country has its problems,
serious ones.

01:10:44.439 --> 01:10:46.639
In some ways,
I've never been more concerned.

01:10:46.974 --> 01:10:49.777
But deep down, we all want
the same basic things.

01:10:50.077 --> 01:10:51.378
Freedom, justice...

01:10:51.879 --> 01:10:53.812
- respect.
- Yes, exactly.

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:56.884
And that's why we're here,
to talk things out,

01:10:57.118 --> 01:10:59.686
to rediscover our common ground,

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.125
because after all,
the things that we share...

01:11:05.159 --> 01:11:07.292
are the things that make us
truly exceptional.

01:11:07.294 --> 01:11:09.729
You really believe
we're exceptional?

01:11:10.164 --> 01:11:11.366
Now? Today?

01:11:12.266 --> 01:11:13.700
Of course I do, Lionel.

01:11:15.068 --> 01:11:16.036
Don't you?

01:11:17.171 --> 01:11:18.305
I believe I'm exceptional.

01:11:19.573 --> 01:11:20.839
I believe you are
a hypocritical charlatan,

01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:24.276
and you, Senator,
are a sanctimonious twot.

01:11:32.952 --> 01:11:34.185
You're angry.

01:11:34.187 --> 01:11:35.289
You should be.

01:11:35.823 --> 01:11:37.424
Our best days are behind us.

01:11:38.191 --> 01:11:39.692
And they're not coming back.

01:11:40.494 --> 01:11:42.994
No promised land awaits you.

01:11:42.996 --> 01:11:45.197
This was your paradise,
and what did you do with it?

01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:49.837
You turned it into a horrific
parade of war, poverty...

01:11:50.471 --> 01:11:52.906
violence, greed, and despair.

01:11:53.339 --> 01:11:57.842
A thousand rough beasts
slouching toward Bethlehem.

01:11:57.844 --> 01:12:00.114
Yes, the end is nigh,
my friends.

01:12:00.314 --> 01:12:01.513
Yet you live out your days

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:04.285
wallowing in
a disposable selfie culture.

01:12:04.518 --> 01:12:06.986
Addicted to opioids
and bad news.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.790
You elect a deranged conman
just to see what happens.

01:12:11.157 --> 01:12:13.090
You worship at the Apple Store,

01:12:13.092 --> 01:12:16.160
lining up around the block
by the latest shiny new window

01:12:16.162 --> 01:12:18.930
into someone else's
curated life.

01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:22.166
Post pictures of
dead Syrian kids on Facebook

01:12:22.168 --> 01:12:23.069
and 15 seconds later,

01:12:24.505 --> 01:12:25.369
you're shopping for yoga pants
made by an eight-year-old

01:12:25.371 --> 01:12:27.407
in a Bangladeshi sweat shop.

01:12:27.607 --> 01:12:30.709
Now, you be sure to tell
the veteran pumping your gas,

01:12:31.044 --> 01:12:34.111
"Thanks for your service."
He put a tiger in your tank.

01:12:34.113 --> 01:12:35.146
Put your hand on your heart,

01:12:35.148 --> 01:12:36.514
you wear
your heart on your sleeve,

01:12:36.516 --> 01:12:39.517
but who cares about real
feelings when you got emojis?

01:12:39.519 --> 01:12:42.420
You know, you put all your faith
in a... In a non-existing god

01:12:42.422 --> 01:12:44.888
and politicians and corporations

01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:46.991
who treat you like
indentured servants.

01:12:49.529 --> 01:12:51.294
False prophets telling you what
to feel, think, what to buy,

01:12:51.296 --> 01:12:53.132
who to worship, hate, fuck.

01:12:53.466 --> 01:12:55.999
Meanwhile,
we profit off your suffering

01:12:56.001 --> 01:12:57.501
from the retched futility

01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.503
of your most ardent
hopes and dreams.

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:01.339
And do you hold us to account?
No.

01:13:01.341 --> 01:13:02.741
You're too bored.

01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:04.042
Too lazy.

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:05.410
Too fickle.

01:13:05.877 --> 01:13:07.511
Too petty, too mean.

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:10.215
You are complacent and corrupt.

01:13:10.415 --> 01:13:12.216
You lie, you cheat,
and you steal.

01:13:12.218 --> 01:13:14.019
We're just better at it
than you are.

01:13:14.253 --> 01:13:15.989
So, you worship us.

01:13:16.623 --> 01:13:17.990
You throw gold

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:21.225
at... At the jack-booted feet
of the Wall Street raiders.

01:13:21.227 --> 01:13:23.093
The gunrunners,
the pill-peddlers,

01:13:23.095 --> 01:13:26.130
the Bible bangers,
the reality TV stars.

01:13:26.132 --> 01:13:28.431
You got your heads
buried in your phones,

01:13:28.433 --> 01:13:31.304
holding fast to the myth
of your own greatness.

01:13:31.504 --> 01:13:33.336
Well, power down, people!

01:13:33.338 --> 01:13:34.239
Take a look around,

01:13:35.408 --> 01:13:37.009
the American dream
is dead and buried.

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:39.444
And you're dancing on its grave.

01:13:48.387 --> 01:13:49.389
He finished?

01:13:50.657 --> 01:13:52.224
Yeah, I think he's finished.

01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:58.328
Tess? That was amazing.

01:13:58.330 --> 01:13:59.396
I mean,
your uncle just committed

01:13:59.398 --> 01:14:01.832
- career suicide on national TV.
- Leave.

01:14:02.034 --> 01:14:03.366
Oh, come on.
What's he gonna do?

01:14:03.368 --> 01:14:05.702
Lionel is not the one you should
be afraid of right now.

01:14:05.704 --> 01:14:08.907
I told you that stuff
in confidence.

01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:10.409
That's my family.

01:14:11.043 --> 01:14:12.575
- I trusted you.
- Well, maybe

01:14:12.577 --> 01:14:14.077
you shouldn't have
told me those things.

01:14:14.079 --> 01:14:15.580
I mean,
I'm not on his side, Tess.

01:14:16.013 --> 01:14:17.079
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

01:14:17.081 --> 01:14:18.281
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

01:14:18.283 --> 01:14:20.218
I'm the one
who stabbed him in the back.

01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:24.289
You just gave me the scissors.

01:14:24.523 --> 01:14:25.590
- Uh...
- Let's grab dinner,

01:14:26.924 --> 01:14:27.924
and take a breath
and figure the rest out later.

01:14:27.926 --> 01:14:30.295
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

01:14:32.196 --> 01:14:34.366
- What, you think you won?
- I know I did.

01:14:34.599 --> 01:14:36.565
There's no such thing
as being too outrageous.

01:14:36.567 --> 01:14:37.469
Not anymore.

01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:40.035
You have no problem
with what just happened?

01:14:40.037 --> 01:14:41.038
Just one.

01:14:42.374 --> 01:14:44.108
I never told Whitley
any of that personal stuff.

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:46.141
What else did you tell him?

01:14:46.143 --> 01:14:48.380
- She didn't mean to do it.
- Stay out of this, Stanford.

01:14:48.647 --> 01:14:49.878
The Grayson kid.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.613
He tricked her, and...
And she didn't know

01:14:51.615 --> 01:14:53.418
that he'd use
any of this against you.

01:14:54.985 --> 01:14:56.521
And you won, right?

01:15:08.532 --> 01:15:09.600
It's late.

01:15:12.336 --> 01:15:13.471
I'll go check on her.

01:15:18.175 --> 01:15:19.076
Tess?

01:16:03.219 --> 01:16:03.286
<i>Nothing's come in
over the radio.</i>

01:16:04.121 --> 01:16:04.188
She won't have much money.

01:16:05.523 --> 01:16:08.492
We've got eyes at Penn Station,
and the Port Authority.

01:16:09.093 --> 01:16:10.324
Someone will pick her up.

01:16:14.164 --> 01:16:15.198
Is she here?

01:16:16.332 --> 01:16:17.300
Okay.

01:16:18.302 --> 01:16:19.403
Send her up.

01:16:21.538 --> 01:16:22.572
You have a visitor.

01:16:49.265 --> 01:16:50.934
I'm pretty sure that's closed.

01:16:55.505 --> 01:16:56.707
I'm not going back.

01:16:58.141 --> 01:17:00.375
There's nothing you could say
that's gonna change my mind.

01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:09.084
What about me?

01:17:22.532 --> 01:17:23.533
Cozy.

01:17:24.801 --> 01:17:27.035
Yeah, the whole place
is kinda like this.

01:17:27.269 --> 01:17:28.502
I wouldn't know.

01:17:28.504 --> 01:17:30.273
He stopped me at the elevator.

01:17:30.807 --> 01:17:31.774
Tyler.

01:17:33.475 --> 01:17:34.610
Oh, hey.

01:17:37.179 --> 01:17:39.682
Uh, Lionel got you a suite
at the Essex house.

01:17:40.148 --> 01:17:42.148
Two bedrooms,
view of the park, really nice.

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:43.652
That was all Tyler.

01:17:44.219 --> 01:17:46.154
Don't give me any credit,
please.

01:17:47.322 --> 01:17:49.090
Well, we're very grateful.

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:02.302
- God, you're so grey.
- Uh,

01:18:02.304 --> 01:18:05.207
Take them... Take them down to
the hotel and get them set up.

01:18:05.641 --> 01:18:06.840
Oh, we can handle it.

01:18:06.842 --> 01:18:08.778
And make sure
they take out the minibar.

01:18:10.679 --> 01:18:13.482
That... I know I've got
no right to ask you, but, um...

01:18:14.283 --> 01:18:16.616
I'm still working on
our next step

01:18:16.618 --> 01:18:18.618
and I was thinking
if it wasn't too much trouble...

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:21.088
- How long do you need?
- A week. Two, tops.

01:18:21.723 --> 01:18:24.326
- So, I could make a plan.
- Why start now?

01:18:32.869 --> 01:18:35.635
Well, that went well.

01:18:35.637 --> 01:18:39.673
So, New York City, huh?

01:18:39.675 --> 01:18:41.542
Don't you just love it? Come on.

01:18:41.742 --> 01:18:43.211
- Tell me everything.
- Okay.

01:18:46.247 --> 01:18:48.481
And then you wanted
to get your ears pierced.

01:18:48.483 --> 01:18:50.518
So, uh, what's the plan?

01:18:50.819 --> 01:18:53.587
Cathy Mercer
has a sister in Fayetteville

01:18:53.589 --> 01:18:55.823
and she can hook me up
with some temp work down there.

01:18:56.358 --> 01:18:58.292
I feel really hopeful this time.

01:18:59.226 --> 01:19:01.528
I learned a lot about myself
these past few weeks.

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:02.764
Then why'd you leave?

01:19:03.665 --> 01:19:05.132
Because I miss my girl.

01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:07.134
But we had a deal, Mama.

01:19:07.636 --> 01:19:08.971
I know, and I... I went.

01:19:10.304 --> 01:19:13.374
I went, and I did it, and I
got what I could out of it.

01:19:13.574 --> 01:19:15.007
Just to stay there any longer

01:19:15.009 --> 01:19:17.445
seemed like a waste of time
and money, so...

01:19:17.713 --> 01:19:19.814
Do they give you a refund
if you check out early?

01:19:20.983 --> 01:19:22.216
Hmm...

01:19:23.684 --> 01:19:26.554
I see Uncle Lionel
has rubbed off on you.

01:19:27.421 --> 01:19:28.723
No, he hasn't.

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:30.324
I get it.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.561
He came through for you
in the clutch.

01:19:34.462 --> 01:19:36.364
Gave you a fancy place to crash.

01:19:36.597 --> 01:19:39.366
Bought you some nice things.
Things I could never give you.

01:19:41.936 --> 01:19:44.372
You really think I care
about all that stuff?

01:19:44.605 --> 01:19:46.841
- Well...
- I only...

01:19:47.675 --> 01:19:49.677
ever just wanted you to be okay.

01:19:50.678 --> 01:19:53.712
Mom, look at me, can you promise
me you're gonna be okay?

01:19:53.714 --> 01:19:54.882
I want to,

01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:57.551
but I'm not supposed to make
any big promises right now.

01:19:58.787 --> 01:20:00.788
Okay? That's one of the things
that I learned.

01:20:01.555 --> 01:20:02.657
It's what they teach you.

01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:06.192
I've just got to take it
day by day, right now.

01:20:07.762 --> 01:20:08.796
Day by day.

01:20:14.568 --> 01:20:16.169
You know I want to...

01:20:16.569 --> 01:20:18.570
be one of those
Harper moms, right?

01:20:18.572 --> 01:20:20.407
That you see
on the website and...

01:20:20.808 --> 01:20:23.377
where they play squash,
lacrosse.

01:20:24.411 --> 01:20:27.615
And wear those big
stupid straw-hats, right?

01:20:29.016 --> 01:20:31.418
It just might take me
a little longer to get there.

01:20:35.889 --> 01:20:37.756
Do a sit down with Anderson,

01:20:37.758 --> 01:20:40.391
open up about your past
and your anger issues,

01:20:40.393 --> 01:20:42.295
the steps you're taking
in becoming a better man,

01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:44.731
admit that you said things
that you shouldn't have.

01:20:44.999 --> 01:20:46.231
What were those?

01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:48.266
This story is gonna be in

01:20:48.268 --> 01:20:49.500
the first paragraph
of your obituary,

01:20:49.502 --> 01:20:51.906
I really wish
you would take it seriously.

01:20:52.673 --> 01:20:53.673
I am!

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:55.442
This is a gift, Val.

01:20:56.509 --> 01:20:57.544
How are my numbers?

01:21:00.413 --> 01:21:02.348
Come on, I know you're polling.
What do they say?

01:21:04.718 --> 01:21:05.784
They love you.

01:21:05.786 --> 01:21:07.487
And why would I
apologize for that?

01:21:08.755 --> 01:21:09.723
Right.

01:21:10.791 --> 01:21:13.393
Great. You, uh, ha!
You got a bump.

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.894
Do you really think

01:21:15.896 --> 01:21:18.932
that they give a shit
about you, Lionel?

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:23.703
They just wanna see you
burn the house down.

01:21:24.603 --> 01:21:26.838
They don't even care
if you're still inside.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.773
In fact,
they don't care what you do

01:21:28.775 --> 01:21:30.944
just as long as it's big.

01:21:31.878 --> 01:21:33.579
Then I better make it big.

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.385
- What about Tess?
- What about her?

01:21:49.462 --> 01:21:52.498
I'm tired of trying
to fix this, Lionel.

01:21:53.099 --> 01:21:55.267
I... I... I can't.

01:21:57.003 --> 01:21:58.470
I just, I... I...

01:22:00.539 --> 01:22:01.540
I can't.

01:22:15.621 --> 01:22:16.920
Maybe it seems like
a small thing,

01:22:16.922 --> 01:22:18.024
this choice you're making.

01:22:19.259 --> 01:22:20.993
Small choices can have
major consequences.

01:22:22.595 --> 01:22:23.861
You really think
they'd give it to me?

01:22:23.863 --> 01:22:24.997
I do.

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.401
In the language,
it's a bit cold.

01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:31.703
Makes it sound like
you're cutting all ties.

01:22:32.504 --> 01:22:33.870
But you're simply
freeing yourself

01:22:33.872 --> 01:22:35.440
to chart your own course.

01:22:39.878 --> 01:22:41.312
I appreciate this...

01:22:42.714 --> 01:22:43.715
but I'm good.

01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:47.086
My mom and I, we figured
things out on our own.

01:22:47.719 --> 01:22:48.921
She signed your letter?

01:22:50.388 --> 01:22:52.391
She didn't sign it because
I didn't want her to sign it.

01:22:53.158 --> 01:22:55.827
She's leaving tomorrow
and I'm going with her.

01:22:59.031 --> 01:23:00.398
Opportunities like this...

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.334
they're very rare.

01:23:04.136 --> 01:23:05.503
So are mothers.

01:23:09.241 --> 01:23:13.644
Yeah, she needs me,
but I need her, too.

01:23:15.581 --> 01:23:17.348
I won't ask you to understand.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.754
Thank you, Kent.

01:23:24.789 --> 01:23:25.791
Really.

01:23:50.215 --> 01:23:52.483
Hey. Uh,
Claremont on two.

01:23:59.191 --> 01:24:00.458
Hello, Arthur.

01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:04.395
<i>Lionel, my boy,
I wanted to wish you luck today</i>

01:24:04.695 --> 01:24:06.097
<i>This is a big moment for you.</i>

01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:07.464
<i>Your first show back</i>

01:24:09.201 --> 01:24:10.468
<i>since you told Uncle Sam
to go fuck himself.</i>

01:24:11.636 --> 01:24:12.636
<i>You're the last
of a great breed.</i>

01:24:13.604 --> 01:24:14.837
<i>Joe's doing a goddamn podcast,</i>

01:24:14.839 --> 01:24:17.039
<i>Glen just walks around
hugging people.</i>

01:24:17.041 --> 01:24:18.275
<i>I'm proud of you, son.</i>

01:24:18.277 --> 01:24:19.708
<i>You tapped a new vein here.</i>

01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:23.078
<i>Don't back down,
just keep being an angry prick</i>

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.183
<i>and then we'll be laughing all
the way to the bank.</i>

01:24:27.319 --> 01:24:29.120
Thank you, sir.

01:24:31.188 --> 01:24:33.124
With friends like that,
who needs family, right?

01:24:35.259 --> 01:24:36.358
I think a guy from Stanford

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.162
would know when to keep
his trap shut.

01:24:39.696 --> 01:24:40.730
I guess that's a good thing
I didn't go to Stanford, then.

01:24:41.599 --> 01:24:42.600
I know.

01:24:43.668 --> 01:24:44.768
You went to Penn.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.055
Tell them
I'll be back in a minute.

01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:07.058
But you're on in 10.

01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:14.764
Give me a minute.
And you just gave it to him?

01:25:15.131 --> 01:25:17.134
Do you realize
what we've got riding on this?

01:25:17.667 --> 01:25:20.269
Jerry, get a tape out,
just in case.

01:25:22.872 --> 01:25:23.873
Yeah?

01:25:24.673 --> 01:25:25.675
What?

01:25:26.743 --> 01:25:27.811
Lionel, no.

01:25:28.178 --> 01:25:29.179
Lionel, no.

01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:31.581
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

01:25:31.982 --> 01:25:33.116
<i>It's a bad idea.</i>

01:25:45.396 --> 01:25:47.095
<i>Get ready for</i>

01:25:47.097 --> 01:25:49.164
<i>The Lionel Macomb Show.</i>

01:25:49.166 --> 01:25:51.733
<i>Lionel Macomb is fired up.</i>

01:25:51.735 --> 01:25:53.935
<i>Oh, you're so hot,
Lionel.</i>

01:26:01.244 --> 01:26:03.680
N... Now?
Am I speaking? Oh.

01:26:05.248 --> 01:26:07.047
Don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't do that.

01:26:07.049 --> 01:26:08.051
I'm sorry.

01:26:09.185 --> 01:26:12.054
Hello, America.

01:26:12.922 --> 01:26:14.523
Um, it's Wendell.

01:26:14.757 --> 01:26:16.592
I'm sitting in for Lionel.

01:26:17.092 --> 01:26:18.560
Lionel Macomb.

01:26:18.962 --> 01:26:19.996
He's usually here.

01:26:20.729 --> 01:26:22.932
Um... It's his show,
most of the time.

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.401
But he... He's out,
so, I'm... It's Wendell,

01:26:26.403 --> 01:26:29.669
and, um, I just wanted
to say to begin,

01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:31.874
I'd like to say one...
Just one thing.

01:26:32.075 --> 01:26:33.742
I can't imagine
what's that gonna be.

01:26:33.976 --> 01:26:37.278
Talk's not cheap, it's...
Oh, they can't see it.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.049
Talk's not cheap, it's...
It's toxic.

01:26:47.257 --> 01:26:50.225
Oh, well, I'm honored.

01:26:50.426 --> 01:26:53.562
I got myself a private audience
with the king.

01:26:54.096 --> 01:26:56.598
You can save the speech, Lionel,
I know why you're here.

01:26:56.865 --> 01:26:57.866
Where's Tess?

01:26:59.835 --> 01:27:01.904
Tess made up
her own mind, just...

01:27:02.905 --> 01:27:04.306
accept that and wish us well.

01:27:04.772 --> 01:27:06.106
She's 16-years-old.

01:27:06.108 --> 01:27:08.310
By definition,
she's mentally unsound.

01:27:09.111 --> 01:27:10.846
She'd follow you anywhere
and you know it.

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.446
She's still a kid.

01:27:12.448 --> 01:27:14.149
She's not supposed to
leave me yet.

01:27:14.782 --> 01:27:16.349
Someday, she's gonna leave.

01:27:16.351 --> 01:27:18.920
You keep going like this,
she may not come back.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.856
You should know.

01:27:26.395 --> 01:27:31.233
I'm sorry that I couldn't
be your mother, Lionel.

01:27:33.135 --> 01:27:35.735
I was 17-years-old.

01:27:35.737 --> 01:27:37.872
I was barely older
than Tess is now.

01:27:38.906 --> 01:27:40.242
I didn't know anything.

01:27:41.443 --> 01:27:42.610
I'm sorry.

01:27:50.252 --> 01:27:52.019
You don't need to be my mother.

01:27:53.455 --> 01:27:54.755
Just be hers.

01:27:57.325 --> 01:28:00.195
Tess is the one good thing
in my life, you know.

01:28:00.395 --> 01:28:01.996
She's the one good thing I have.

01:28:03.932 --> 01:28:05.967
I know I don't deserve her,
you think I don't know that?

01:28:07.936 --> 01:28:10.671
I'm trying, really trying.

01:28:12.273 --> 01:28:14.243
I can't... I can't lose her.

01:28:15.176 --> 01:28:18.646
She is the only thing that has
always been there for me.

01:28:19.548 --> 01:28:21.182
But that's not her job.

01:28:23.017 --> 01:28:25.019
She thinks she can save you.

01:28:25.786 --> 01:28:27.356
We both know
it doesn't work like that.

01:28:32.427 --> 01:28:34.962
How many fifths of Beam
did we water down?

01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:38.833
How many wolves did we try
and chase out the door?

01:28:42.003 --> 01:28:43.171
Pete Stubbs.

01:28:45.805 --> 01:28:46.741
Ralph Sorensen.

01:28:48.242 --> 01:28:51.212
Oh, God.
Do you remember Buddy Reynolds?

01:28:52.947 --> 01:28:53.948
Buddy Wrecker.

01:28:54.315 --> 01:28:56.083
Yeah. Buddy the Home Wrecker.

01:28:56.918 --> 01:28:59.218
Oh, God. Do you...
Do you remember the time

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:01.487
that you put his Barracuda
in neutral?

01:29:01.489 --> 01:29:03.589
To see if it would
roll down the hill.

01:29:03.591 --> 01:29:05.056
The goddamn thing

01:29:05.058 --> 01:29:06.825
was halfway down the driveway

01:29:06.827 --> 01:29:08.860
before we realized
that son of a bitch

01:29:08.862 --> 01:29:11.698
was passed out in the backseat.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.801
I... I... I didn't...
Didn't know that.

01:29:20.241 --> 01:29:22.443
Why do you care, Lionel?

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.716
I've been asking myself
the same question for weeks.

01:29:32.886 --> 01:29:34.921
I know you've done real well
for yourself,

01:29:35.556 --> 01:29:37.891
telling other people
how to think, but...

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:41.061
you don't get to do that here.

01:29:43.930 --> 01:29:45.266
Can I tell you what I think?

01:29:47.467 --> 01:29:51.204
You keep running
too fast, too far, too long,

01:29:52.405 --> 01:29:54.275
you end up right back
where you started.

01:29:55.442 --> 01:29:57.310
You become the thing
you're running from.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:02.382
She won't stop running
unless you do.

01:30:06.086 --> 01:30:07.220
Stop running.

01:30:18.431 --> 01:30:19.631
I... I know it's
a cliché,

01:30:19.633 --> 01:30:22.534
but you really don't understand
a person's life

01:30:22.536 --> 01:30:25.238
until you've walked
a mile in their shoes.

01:30:25.672 --> 01:30:30.040
And so, I actually find
that it's a helpful exercise,

01:30:30.042 --> 01:30:32.545
um, literally and figuratively.

01:30:32.979 --> 01:30:34.545
So why... Why don't you try it?

01:30:34.547 --> 01:30:36.649
You go outside
to the grocery store

01:30:36.651 --> 01:30:39.651
and stop a fellow pedestrian

01:30:39.653 --> 01:30:43.154
and say, "Hey, would you mind
if we trade shoes

01:30:43.156 --> 01:30:46.226
and I walk in yours for a mile
or maybe two,

01:30:46.426 --> 01:30:47.625
if the weather permits?"

01:30:47.627 --> 01:30:50.360
Um, you know,
sometimes they ignore you,

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:53.264
sometimes you lose your shoes,

01:30:53.266 --> 01:30:55.065
um, and sometimes
you get athlete's foot.

01:30:55.067 --> 01:30:57.067
- But I think it...
- How... How much time we have?

01:30:57.069 --> 01:30:58.003
Two hours.

01:30:59.471 --> 01:31:01.508
...we can learn something really
valuable about other people's...

01:31:01.708 --> 01:31:04.910
uh... lives and feet.

01:31:07.647 --> 01:31:09.279
Okay. Thank you for your call.

01:31:09.281 --> 01:31:10.481
All right.
That's enough. That's enough.

01:31:10.483 --> 01:31:11.917
- Out of the studio.
- No, I'm...

01:31:13.419 --> 01:31:14.318
- Out of the studio right now.
- But I still have

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.188
so many more callers to take.

01:31:20.092 --> 01:31:21.093
Hey.

01:31:27.966 --> 01:31:30.035
I love a good road trip.

01:31:31.537 --> 01:31:32.438
Hi.

01:31:34.407 --> 01:31:36.075
He's not gonna come, is he?

01:31:36.475 --> 01:31:39.242
I'm sure he would have,
but, you know, he's got the show

01:31:39.244 --> 01:31:42.245
and that crippling inability
to express his vulnerability.

01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:45.584
There you go again,
making him look good.

01:31:46.218 --> 01:31:47.219
Yeah.

01:31:48.555 --> 01:31:51.423
Actually, I've decided not
to do that... anymore.

01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:53.557
I have been doing it
way too long.

01:31:53.559 --> 01:31:54.725
I've got this crazy idea

01:31:54.727 --> 01:31:56.025
that I should stop
trying to fix people

01:31:56.027 --> 01:31:57.629
and do what's best for me
for a while.

01:32:00.232 --> 01:32:02.533
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.

01:32:05.371 --> 01:32:07.572
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.773
You're gonna let me know
where to find you, too?

01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:10.942
Yeah, of course.

01:32:12.176 --> 01:32:14.380
You know that I'm gonna be fine.

01:32:18.684 --> 01:32:20.586
This is yours, by the way.

01:32:29.762 --> 01:32:32.564
It'll look great
wherever you choose to hang it.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.000
Thank you.

01:32:43.474 --> 01:32:44.909
You helped me a lot.

01:33:38.595 --> 01:33:41.298
Mom, we need to talk.

01:33:44.435 --> 01:33:45.436
I know.

01:35:13.489 --> 01:35:15.390
<i>Get ready for</i>

01:35:15.392 --> 01:35:17.426
<i>The Lionel Macomb Show.</i>

01:35:17.794 --> 01:35:20.428
<i>Lionel Macomb is fired up.</i>

01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:22.663
<i>Oh, you're so hot,
Lionel.</i>

01:35:25.802 --> 01:35:30.139
Well, friends, it seems that
I made a few headlines lately.

01:35:31.273 --> 01:35:33.407
Uh, last week,
the guys in charge

01:35:33.409 --> 01:35:35.511
<i>decided to give me
another chance.</i>

01:35:36.245 --> 01:35:40.349
You gave me another chance,
and I gave you Wendell.

01:35:45.754 --> 01:35:48.957
You know, most of the time,
I, uh, I think I make you feel

01:35:48.959 --> 01:35:52.361
pretty good about yourselves,
make you feel righteous,

01:35:52.595 --> 01:35:54.129
powerful, angry.

01:35:55.431 --> 01:35:57.499
I... I say the things that
you wish you could say.

01:35:58.601 --> 01:36:00.836
<i>But sometimes,
I'm gonna rub you the wrong way</i>

01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:03.339
And I make no excuses.

01:36:04.306 --> 01:36:07.342
Did I call you
lazy, fat, and stupid?

01:36:08.011 --> 01:36:10.010
Not directly, but, uh,

01:36:10.012 --> 01:36:12.615
let's face it, some of you
could stand to lose a few.

01:36:13.582 --> 01:36:15.482
<i>You know,
if you spend too much time</i>

01:36:15.484 --> 01:36:17.751
<i>in front of a microphone
in a padded room,</i>

01:36:17.753 --> 01:36:19.886
<i>you forget there are things
that you need</i>

01:36:19.888 --> 01:36:22.391
<i>that you can't give yourself.
Uh...</i>

01:36:22.825 --> 01:36:24.526
<i>A song by Johnny Cash.</i>

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.197
<i>An honest ear, a...
A kick in the ass.</i>

01:36:29.698 --> 01:36:33.435
<i>That stuff has to come
from somewhere else.</i>

01:36:33.869 --> 01:36:35.370
<i>Maybe it comes from you.</i>

01:36:36.905 --> 01:36:39.908
<i>You know, we're not one
big, happy American family.</i>

01:36:40.408 --> 01:36:41.610
It doesn't exist.

01:36:42.811 --> 01:36:45.380
I mean, we sit down
to Thanksgiving dinner,

01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:47.848
try and forget
what happened the year before.

01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:51.852
We... We argue, we... We screw up,
we make a mess of things,

01:36:51.854 --> 01:36:55.356
but... we keep
coming back to the table.

01:36:59.694 --> 01:37:01.329
Especially if
we want a fifth helping.

01:37:03.498 --> 01:37:06.634
You know, we don't have to
see eye to eye all the time.

01:37:07.402 --> 01:37:09.771
We can disagree
without being disagreeable.

01:37:10.438 --> 01:37:13.574
And don't call in to say that
Barack Obama said that, I know.

01:37:17.412 --> 01:37:19.913
<i>You know, a friend of mine
once asked me,</i>

01:37:19.915 --> 01:37:24.887
<i>"Lionel, have you ever
considered for just one second</i>

01:37:26.521 --> 01:37:28.523
<i>the possibility
that you might be wrong?"</i>

01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:33.193
<i>And I had a quick comeback,
like I always do.</i>

01:37:33.627 --> 01:37:35.329
<i>But a comeback's not an answer.</i>

01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:37.464
<i>I thought I had all the answers</i>

01:37:39.101 --> 01:37:41.736
<i>that I didn't think there was
anything I... I needed to know,</i>

01:37:42.003 --> 01:37:43.705
<i>especially from a teenager.</i>

01:37:45.206 --> 01:37:46.772
You know, most of the time,
I'm... I'm right on the money.

01:37:46.774 --> 01:37:47.975
I mean, I'm laser-sharp.

01:37:49.178 --> 01:37:54.315
But, sometimes,
I've said things that I regret.

01:37:55.116 --> 01:37:59.353
I've, uh... I've been wrong.

01:38:03.057 --> 01:38:06.393
<i>You probably think you know me
pretty well by now, but, um...</i>

01:38:08.396 --> 01:38:11.998
well, we all of us have stuff
that we like to keep hidden.

01:38:13.468 --> 01:38:14.632
Stuff that we don't
want to remember

01:38:14.634 --> 01:38:16.434
but we can't
bring ourselves to forget.

01:38:16.436 --> 01:38:20.371
So we... We... We put it in a box

01:38:20.373 --> 01:38:24.544
and put that box
in the bottom drawer.

01:38:27.048 --> 01:38:31.452
And most days,
I keep that drawer shut tight.

01:38:33.553 --> 01:38:36.323
But if you want, you can, uh...

01:38:39.926 --> 01:38:41.361
take a look inside.

01:38:43.064 --> 01:38:45.900
<i>It's a free country, kind of.</i>

01:38:46.934 --> 01:38:50.436
<i>Go on. I'll wait.</i>

01:39:11.158 --> 01:39:11.825
<i>I still think
you're better off without it.</i>

01:39:13.026 --> 01:39:14.728
<i>After everything
that's happened,</i>

01:39:16.263 --> 01:39:17.427
<i>I'm sure you've got some things
you'd like to say to me.</i>

01:39:17.429 --> 01:39:20.634
<i>So, how about
you give me a call?</i>

01:39:21.902 --> 01:39:23.936
<i>You can take a turn
doing the talking for a while.</i>

01:39:25.772 --> 01:39:27.706
But don't forget,
it's still my show.

01:39:28.108 --> 01:39:29.309
I ain't going anywhere.

01:39:31.443 --> 01:39:33.847
<i>So, Earl,
let's open up the lines.</i>

01:39:34.447 --> 01:39:35.615
<i>Let's get down to it.</i>

01:39:36.682 --> 01:39:39.418
<i>You and me. Go on.</i>

01:39:40.686 --> 01:39:41.720
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

01:39:43.456 --> 01:39:44.390
Please.

01:39:48.061 --> 01:39:49.863
I wanna hear
what you've got to say.

01:40:11.118 --> 01:40:14.118
