00:47.714 --> 00:48.882
B...

00:50.425 --> 00:51.760
B...

00:53.178 --> 00:54.304
Blue sky!

01:12.322 --> 01:13.782
Sky.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.035
S...

01:17.535 --> 01:18.536
Clouds.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.346
D...

01:40.642 --> 01:42.477
D...

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
Dog!

01:45.271 --> 01:46.648
Dog? Where's the dog?

01:46.731 --> 01:47.732
Over there.

01:47.816 --> 01:48.816
Didn't you see it?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.360
No.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.112
What kind of dog was it?

01:52.695 --> 01:54.030
Small dog.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.574
Interesting.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.786
E for...

02:00.537 --> 02:01.830
elephant!

02:01.913 --> 02:03.581
Elephant? Where?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.208
Yeah. What, did you miss it?

02:47.834 --> 02:51.254
Hey, sweetie. Don't pick at your scab.
Come on.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.131
I was just checking.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.465
Did you make that hole?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.176
It was already like that.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.094
It'll leave a scar.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.473
I wouldn't even have a scab
if Lily Stevens didn't push me.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.644
Lily Stevens wouldn't have pushed you
if you hadn't thrown chalk at her.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.105
She was making faces at me.

03:09.772 --> 03:10.932
We don't hurt people.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.566
Not ever.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.319
She deserved to be hurt.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.198
No, she didn't.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.283
Clara, no one deserves to be hurt,

03:20.366 --> 03:21.367
no one.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.910
Okay?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.412
Come on.

03:28.666 --> 03:29.918
All good?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.001
Yeah.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.891
<i>I got to meet TJ.
He's a nice, nice gentleman.</i>

03:44.974 --> 03:47.294
<i>Please go in to TJ's
and get yourselves some waffles there.</i>

03:47.352 --> 03:49.896
<i>So that is on the list,
and I'm gonna put it down as number two</i>

03:49.979 --> 03:50.979
<i>because last...</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:56.194
<i>We grow or we die.</i>

03:56.277 --> 03:59.822
<i>So, we're unaware
that we use events as a trigger</i>

03:59.906 --> 04:02.909
<i>to get home back to the patterns we know</i>

04:02.992 --> 04:04.327
<i>even if it's uncomfortable.</i>

04:05.078 --> 04:06.913
<i>So, if you identify where you live,</i>

04:06.996 --> 04:08.915
<i>emotionally, the patterns
that are limiting you,</i>

04:08.998 --> 04:10.935
<i>the second piece is find the antidote.</i>

04:10.959 --> 04:13.586
- Shit.
<i>- We all will face,</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:15.380
<i>multiple times in our life,
extreme stress.</i>

04:15.463 --> 04:17.757
<i>The difference in peoples' lives
is not what we face,</i>

04:17.839 --> 04:19.676
<i>it's what we do with what we face.</i>

04:20.385 --> 04:23.471
<i>Life gives us these events,
these, quote, "horrific events,"</i>

04:23.554 --> 04:26.099
<i>because there's an area of our life
that has to grow.</i>

04:26.182 --> 04:28.017
<i>You can take yourself from a place</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:31.104
<i>where in the face
of absolute total tragedy,</i>

04:31.187 --> 04:32.187
<i>you triumph...</i>

05:11.311 --> 05:12.937
You've gotta be kidding me.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.190
Oh, shit.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.071
Mommy...

05:23.156 --> 05:25.033
why did we stop?

05:34.917 --> 05:36.377
Oh, great.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.009
Ow!

05:48.598 --> 05:50.308
Where are we, Mommy?

05:55.438 --> 05:56.856
Somewhere, sweetie.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.883
You know,
Poppy taught me how to change a tire.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.552
One day I'll teach you.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.727
In the meantime,
you should probably come over here and...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.355
get a head start and pay attention.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.567
Nah, that's boring.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.279
Yeah, suit yourself.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.824
Maybe you can help

06:48.282 --> 06:49.867
by getting Mommy her coffee.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.121
Come on.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.629
- Mommy...
- Oh, God.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.258
Oh, God.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.844
When we get to Oklahoma, can we...

07:12.014 --> 07:13.014
Clara?

07:13.349 --> 07:14.350
Clara?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.898
- Show me!
- Mommy, it bit me!

07:20.982 --> 07:22.400
Let me see, Clara.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.154
Oh, God.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.530
Okay. It's okay, sweetie.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.200
It's okay. It's okay.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.753
Come on, come on.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.048
Oh, it's okay. Clara? Clara?

07:46.507 --> 07:47.717
Come on, baby.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.594
Oh, sweetie.

08:04.942 --> 08:05.942
Hold on, sweetie.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.364
Hello?

08:12.450 --> 08:13.450
Hello?

08:14.952 --> 08:16.204
Is anybody home?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.497
Hello?

08:21.459 --> 08:24.212
Come on, stay with me, baby, okay?

08:24.295 --> 08:25.922
Just stay with me, baby.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.048
Stay with me.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.383
Oh, God. Come on, come on.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.472
I'm so sorry for barging in.

08:34.889 --> 08:38.433
My little girl, she got bitten by a snake,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.102
and I really need your help.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.105
I got a flat tire,
and I can't get a signal.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.608
She's really burning up.
I don't know what to do.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.860
You're in luck, darlin'.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.696
I've worked on many a bite out here.
Let me help her.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.031
Oh, thank God.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.951
- Oh, she's going blue. She's going blue!
- Here, let me.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.327
Please help her!

08:59.622 --> 09:00.915
What can you do?

09:00.998 --> 09:02.416
The nearest town's Tulia.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.377
You'll find a hospital there.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.088
You best get that tire sorted out.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.260
Come on, don't just stand there, honey.
Time's a-wasting.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.429
We'll discuss payment later.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.266
It's okay, sweetie.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.839
Mommy's here.

09:49.922 --> 09:50.922
Clara?

09:51.716 --> 09:52.925
Clara.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.098
Mommy...

10:59.450 --> 11:02.620
Okay. Come on, sweetie.

11:43.577 --> 11:46.247
<i>We'll keep her in
for the day, monitor her condition,</i>

11:46.330 --> 11:49.291
but trust me, if a five-year-old
was bitten by a rattlesnake...

11:49.375 --> 11:51.001
you'd know it.

11:51.085 --> 11:54.171
From the looks, it's just exhaustion,
mild dehydration.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.508
You should've seen her.
She was burning up, she wasn't breathing.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.719
She turned blue, for Christ sakes.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.120
Were you feeling
out of sorts at all during the drive?

12:07.184 --> 12:08.184
No.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.980
- Medication? You taking anything?
- Nothing, no.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.066
Listen, Phoenix to Oklahoma
can be a long haul.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.819
Yeah, well, I'm not a very good flier,

12:16.902 --> 12:18.863
so driving was the lesser of two evils.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.865
Were you feeling, uh...

12:21.490 --> 12:22.867
Is this necessary?

12:23.242 --> 12:24.368
...apprehensive or...

12:24.869 --> 12:26.954
stressed before the drive?

12:27.663 --> 12:28.789
Uh...

12:28.873 --> 12:31.041
No. Uh, yes, I guess.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.295
It's been pretty crazy. Um...

12:35.921 --> 12:37.298
We're starting over,

12:37.381 --> 12:39.383
and the move's been a lot on Clara.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.886
You're a single mother?

12:43.637 --> 12:44.637
Yes.

12:45.598 --> 12:49.268
Slightly elevated.
Not surprising, but nothing alarming.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.358
Look, I know this sounds crazy.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.739
But there has to be
some kind of explanation.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.824
I mean, that old woman, maybe she had...

13:05.034 --> 13:08.204
I don't know, like an ancient remedy
on her shelf or something.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.622
I'm just...

13:11.165 --> 13:12.917
I'm just telling you what happened.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.544
Your daughter's gonna be fine.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.046
She just needs to rest.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.381
You need to do the same.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.801
Get some sleep.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.017
That's all it is.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.560
God's will.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.688
I know.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.185
Such a pretty little thing.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.564
To think we almost lost her.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.359
You really are lucky.
Things could have ended much differently.

15:03.694 --> 15:04.694
You are?

15:05.446 --> 15:07.698
I'm here to talk about your payment,
Ms. Ridgeway.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.616
Oh.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.200
Why don't you pull up a chair?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.287
So, we have insurance,
my daughter and I, both.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.539
We're both covered.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.875
Oh, I'm not talking
about your hospital debt.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.669
I'm talking about the other debt.

15:22.671 --> 15:23.923
The one you now owe.

15:28.552 --> 15:31.138
What was done for your daughter
doesn't come cheap.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.432
Her little soul was spared.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.935
And now you owe one in return.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.105
I'm sorry, I thought you said soul.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.233
Ms. Ridgeway, you don't have long
to pay your debt.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.403
You only have until sunset, which is...

15:47.696 --> 15:48.781
now only...

15:49.823 --> 15:51.158
seven hours away.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.663
The soul you take can be
any one of your choosing,

15:56.413 --> 15:57.790
but it must be human.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.543
And it must be paid in full and on time.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.594
Okay, I...

16:11.136 --> 16:13.305
don't really understand what's going on.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.975
I don't know who you are.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.338
I think I'm gonna call security.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.770
I would like you to leave the room,
leave my daughter alone.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.733
Failure to meet your debt, Ms. Ridgeway,

16:24.817 --> 16:28.153
will result in your daughter's condition
returning to what it was.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.531
I'd like you to leave now.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.828
Let me, uh, remind you
of what that'd look like.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.875
Clara? Clara?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.712
- Sweetie?
- She will suffer...

16:44.795 --> 16:46.005
What've you done to her?

16:46.088 --> 16:48.507
...before she succumbs
to the snake venom...

16:49.800 --> 16:52.177
working its way through her tiny body.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.679
No, please, stop it.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.640
She will die, Ms. Ridgeway,
that I can assure you.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.601
Make it stop! Fucking get out of here!
Get out!

16:59.685 --> 17:01.395
Help! Someone come in here, now!

17:01.478 --> 17:03.480
Please, somebody help me!

17:03.564 --> 17:05.023
Seven hours, Ms. Ridgeway.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.694
You best get a move on.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.319
Mommy...

17:12.364 --> 17:14.782
I need help! In here!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.242
Quick, please!

17:16.326 --> 17:17.326
Oh, God!

17:18.829 --> 17:20.204
Okay, I need you to call...

17:20.289 --> 17:22.517
Did something happen here?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.292
- Who do you want us to call?
- Miss?

17:25.252 --> 17:26.252
Miss?

17:30.841 --> 17:31.841
Miss?

17:35.971 --> 17:39.975
- Should I call security?
- No, no, no, no! No, don't.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.310
That won't be necessary.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.561
Are you okay?

17:50.652 --> 17:53.655
<i>I've been up since before dawn, driving.</i>

17:53.739 --> 17:56.492
<i>Maybe I need to check into the motel
across the road.</i>

17:56.992 --> 17:59.161
<i>That's probably for the best.</i>

17:59.244 --> 18:00.788
<i>We'll keep an eye on her for you.</i>

18:00.871 --> 18:02.998
<i>Okay, I'll just say goodbye to her.</i>

18:09.254 --> 18:10.798
Oh, my God.

18:12.841 --> 18:16.345
I don't know what's going on, Clara.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.555
I'm sorry, sweetie.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.058
This is insane.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.395
I just want you to be okay.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.857
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

18:30.651 --> 18:31.651
<i>Hello?</i>

18:33.195 --> 18:35.030
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

20:10.459 --> 20:11.460
Great.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.883
I'm fine!

20:19.468 --> 20:21.428
I'm fine, I don't need any help!

20:27.392 --> 20:28.727
She's gonna die, Katrina!

20:29.228 --> 20:30.812
Only one way to save her!

20:30.896 --> 20:32.189
Stay away from me.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.441
There's nowhere to run!

20:34.524 --> 20:36.443
You stay away from me!

20:56.672 --> 20:57.673
Fuck off!

24:16.288 --> 24:18.331
<i>This is the diner in Tulia, Texas</i>

24:18.415 --> 24:22.752
<i>where 47-year-old lawyer Donald Covington
was fatally stabbed in the chest</i>

24:22.836 --> 24:27.549
<i>by 32-year-old school teacher
Michael James Warner just before sunset.</i>

24:28.133 --> 24:31.011
<i>Witnesses say Warner kept repeating,
in a bizarre manner,</i>

24:31.094 --> 24:33.763
<i>"A soul for a soul,"
as he attacked Covington.</i>

24:33.847 --> 24:35.307

"The difference is not what we face,

26:07.774 --> 26:09.943
it's what we choose to do
when we face it."

28:41.469 --> 28:42.469
Thank you.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.069
Hey, um...

28:58.153 --> 28:59.404
I'm so sorry...

29:00.029 --> 29:01.406
about before.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.200
That...

29:04.284 --> 29:05.326
that was so nosy of me.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.996
I shouldn't have just been peering
into your room like that.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.079
It's fine.

29:09.497 --> 29:12.834
No, I just wanted to offer my condolences.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.336
He's not gone yet.

29:16.963 --> 29:20.383
Oh, no. Uh... Of course not.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.724
- You wanna sit?
- Oh, sure, sure.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.528
Such a...

29:40.612 --> 29:42.697
Such a strange thing...

29:45.074 --> 29:46.910
waiting for your daddy to die.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.376
Um...

29:56.085 --> 29:59.214
Anyway, I'm sorry. What brings you here?

30:00.340 --> 30:02.175
Oh, uh...

30:02.634 --> 30:06.304
my daughter, she got sunstroke.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.306
We've been driving all day, and...

30:08.890 --> 30:10.642
she's not feeling too well.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.227
How's she doing?

30:12.310 --> 30:13.978
She's fine. Um...

30:14.395 --> 30:17.440
Doctor thinks she just needs some rest.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.819
Um, I'm Loraine.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.653
Susan.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.534
Anyway, um, it was nice chatting with you.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.578
I hope you and your little one
get out of here soon.

30:30.662 --> 30:35.083
Well, uh,
actually she's out for the count right now

30:35.166 --> 30:39.379
and I am going stir-crazy
in that silence all by myself.

30:39.462 --> 30:42.048
So I was wondering
if maybe, uh, I could...

30:43.383 --> 30:45.176
uh, keep you company.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.262
With Daddy?

30:47.762 --> 30:48.763
Mm-hmm.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.978
Apparently, they can hear you.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.537
The nurse described it kind of like a...

30:58.690 --> 31:00.775
like a two-way mirror or...

31:03.152 --> 31:05.280
Or was it a one-way mirror?

31:10.034 --> 31:11.744
Either way, he won't be waking up.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.959
But I'm still here, Daddy.

31:20.461 --> 31:21.588
You okay, Susan?

31:29.596 --> 31:31.389
He seems to be at peace.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.226
Yeah.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.441
Oh, shoot.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.989
Hey, y'all here?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.325
B-7.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.951
No, it's at the, um...

31:52.327 --> 31:54.203
All right, just wait there, I'm coming.

31:56.497 --> 31:59.417
Leave it to my sister to get lost
in a hospital this small.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.003
I gotta go grab 'em.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.130
I should go get Clara.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.050
- Thank you, Susan.
- Sure.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.681
I have to do this, I have to do this.

32:55.181 --> 32:57.475
I have to do this, I have to do this,

32:57.558 --> 32:59.519
I have to do this, I have to do this.

33:40.393 --> 33:41.393
Loraine...

33:42.186 --> 33:43.186
who is this?

33:43.229 --> 33:45.857
I was just using the, um, bathroom.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.487
Frank?

37:02.637 --> 37:03.721
Oh, f...

37:16.275 --> 37:17.568
Jesus Christ, lady!

37:18.694 --> 37:19.694
Are you all right?

37:21.113 --> 37:23.741
- Wh... What the hell happened?
- Stay away from me.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.702
What were you thinking?

37:27.536 --> 37:28.996
I almost ended you!

37:31.540 --> 37:32.959
Is everything okay?

37:33.459 --> 37:35.878
Hey, you don't...
You don't look all right.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.713
Look, you want me to call someone?

37:38.631 --> 37:39.631
Let...

37:42.301 --> 37:43.386
You fucking serious?

37:44.220 --> 37:45.220
Hey!

37:48.474 --> 37:49.892
Fucking bath salts, man.

37:59.986 --> 38:06.784
<i>♪ I fall to pieces ♪</i>

38:09.370 --> 38:15.251
<i>♪ Each time I see you again ♪</i>

38:15.668 --> 38:17.461
That one's on the house.

38:17.545 --> 38:22.258
<i>♪ I fall to pieces... ♪</i>

38:22.341 --> 38:23.968
Well, hell, Abbie.

38:25.177 --> 38:28.055
What, you gonna put this down
to another roller derby injury, huh?

38:28.723 --> 38:30.349
It's a heck of a sport you chose there.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.310
Just give me a beer, Francine.

38:35.062 --> 38:36.062
Please?

38:40.276 --> 38:41.986
Definition of insanity

38:42.069 --> 38:44.947
is doing the same thing
and expecting a different result.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.950
So they say.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.500
I know you?

39:05.426 --> 39:06.510
Come on.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.803
Enough's enough.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.152
Let me stay, please, just a little while.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.349
Get up off that stool, Abbie.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.476
Billy, just let her finish her damn beer.

39:13.559 --> 39:17.021
This don't concern you, Francine,
unless, of course, you want it to.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.653
Can't have y'all getting into it here.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.491
- Abbie...
- All right.

39:30.826 --> 39:31.826
All right.

39:32.828 --> 39:33.913
Let's go.

39:34.663 --> 39:35.664
Hold up.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.087
Apologize to Francine for coming in here
and making a scene,

39:41.170 --> 39:42.963
upsetting this nice customer.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.091
Go on.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.014
Sorry.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.727
Just get out of here, both of y'all.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.106
Go on, get!

40:04.610 --> 40:06.487
Place has gone to shit anyways.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.614
Mm-hmm. Go on.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.661
Go, get out!

40:15.871 --> 40:17.271
Ain't they a pair?

40:17.748 --> 40:18.999
They live near here?

40:19.500 --> 40:21.127
Oh, yeah, Tulia's finest.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.839
Only a matter of time
before she ends up in the obituaries.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.551
Some people are just beyond help.

40:39.603 --> 40:40.688
Get off...

40:48.779 --> 40:50.573
Why you always gotta make a scene?

40:50.990 --> 40:52.908
Get in that fucking truck.

40:53.617 --> 40:54.660
Get in the truck!

40:54.743 --> 40:56.745
I'm not standing here
in the goddamn street!

40:57.329 --> 40:59.039
Come on. Get in!

40:59.915 --> 41:00.915
In!

41:54.011 --> 41:56.764
12 Amarosa. 12 Amarosa.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.058
12 Amarosa.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.294
Well, go on. It ain't gonna bite you.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.131
Lightweight, easily concealable,

43:12.715 --> 43:15.092
but most important: accurate.

43:15.175 --> 43:18.387
Shoots a maximum of 16 rounds
through a flush-fitted magazine.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.432
I'll do you two boxes
for the price of one.

43:23.142 --> 43:25.644
You ever, uh, fire one of those, darlin'?

43:25.728 --> 43:26.728
I'll take it.

43:27.313 --> 43:28.313
All right.

43:29.148 --> 43:32.943
I'm just gonna need to see your license.
You're a Texas resident, I take it.

43:33.986 --> 43:34.986
No.

43:36.238 --> 43:40.868
Well, I'm afraid I can't be letting you
purchase a firearm.

43:41.702 --> 43:42.995
Residents of Texas only.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.079
Look...

43:45.205 --> 43:47.708
my daughter and I, we were, uh...

43:47.791 --> 43:49.460
attacked on the road.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.045
I feel like I need protection.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.922
And I don't know what you can do,
but maybe you could just...

43:54.256 --> 43:57.259
just turn a blind eye, or... I don't...

44:00.679 --> 44:02.473
When did it get to be like this?

44:02.556 --> 44:04.975
When did the open roads
of this great country of ours

44:05.059 --> 44:07.186
revert to such savagery?

44:07.811 --> 44:10.189
It's not right, not one bit.

44:11.732 --> 44:12.775
Where's your little one?

44:13.442 --> 44:14.443
In the hospital.

44:15.235 --> 44:16.235
Jesus. What...?

44:18.864 --> 44:21.408
I'm sorry, I can't help you, but...

44:22.201 --> 44:23.702
this man can.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.997
His name's Charlie. Lives here in Tulia.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.540
You can find him here.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.543
It's a cash-only transaction.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.672
I guess you'd call him a private dealer.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.498
<i>What you want?</i>

45:11.792 --> 45:15.003
Hi. Earl, uh, sent me.

45:15.087 --> 45:17.172
He said he'd vouch for me.

45:17.256 --> 45:18.257
Are you Charlie?

45:24.763 --> 45:26.056
<i>Lose the cap.</i>

46:03.218 --> 46:06.263
Okay, Katrina Ridgeway.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.600
I'm gonna have to do a quick body check.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.770
Is that really necessary?

46:15.606 --> 46:16.606
Okay.

46:36.668 --> 46:39.755
- You want me to fix you up some tea?
- No, thank you.

46:42.508 --> 46:44.134
More of a coffee drinker, huh?

46:45.260 --> 46:46.260
I guess.

46:47.095 --> 46:50.474
My wife, Tracy, she'd stock the cupboard

46:50.557 --> 46:53.393
full of a whole variety of exotic flavors.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.729
Hibiscus was her favorite.

46:56.146 --> 46:58.273
- So, can we...
- You sure you don't wanna try some?

46:58.357 --> 46:59.608
It's no trouble.

46:59.691 --> 47:00.776
I'm sure.

47:00.859 --> 47:02.986
I... I've gotta go.

47:05.781 --> 47:07.991
Tracy is no longer with us.

47:15.958 --> 47:20.546
She took the barrel of a Glock,
identical to the one that you're buying...

47:26.260 --> 47:28.095
and put it in her mouth.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.265
Okay, I am so sorry...

47:32.057 --> 47:35.394
so sorry to hear about your wife,
but I've gotta get going.

47:40.107 --> 47:41.483
Listen to me, just...

47:42.276 --> 47:43.276
rabbiting on.

47:44.319 --> 47:46.738
Yeah, she's... She's all yours.

47:47.573 --> 47:48.573
Uh...

47:50.450 --> 47:51.952
The piece, that is.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.662
The rounds are another 50.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.749
I... think I've got 40.

48:01.378 --> 48:04.882
I mean, I can rustle up the other ten,
but I've gotta go.

48:07.301 --> 48:10.804
I ain't gonna deprive a woman
of carrying a piece.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.265
Now, what kind of a man would I be?

48:13.849 --> 48:15.517
I'll let the ten slide.

48:16.810 --> 48:18.270
Thank you, thank you.

48:21.648 --> 48:23.400
You ever handle one of them before?

48:25.736 --> 48:27.487
'Cause if you need some pointers...

48:29.948 --> 48:31.533
I offer that for free.

48:35.162 --> 48:36.371
No, I'm, uh...

48:37.372 --> 48:39.625
Who's the unlucky son of a bitch?

48:39.708 --> 48:40.708
What?

48:41.877 --> 48:42.878
They got it coming?

48:44.254 --> 48:45.923
You out to end someone.

48:46.006 --> 48:48.050
I can see it in your eyes, plain as day.

48:49.384 --> 48:51.553
So, I wanna know.

48:52.387 --> 48:55.432
I wanna know, Katrina Ridgeway...

48:56.600 --> 48:58.060
that you're sure...

48:59.895 --> 49:01.438
that they got it coming.

49:12.699 --> 49:14.701
<i>Hi, it's me again, Mr. Glock.</i>

49:15.202 --> 49:19.247
<i>Uh, I thought today, uh, one of the Glocks
I've not demonstrated</i>

49:19.331 --> 49:22.876
<i>or talked about,
is the good old reliable Glock 19.</i>

49:22.960 --> 49:24.795
<i>It's a magazine full of bullets in it,</i>

49:26.088 --> 49:28.215
<i>and it also has one in the chamber.</i>

49:28.840 --> 49:30.217
<i>I'll quickly check that.</i>

51:28.794 --> 51:30.796
So, what'd he say?

51:31.254 --> 51:32.297
What do you mean?

51:33.548 --> 51:34.841
What'd he say?

51:37.177 --> 51:39.054
Nothing.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.266
So, he said nothing?

51:45.894 --> 51:48.271
Billy, I kept my head down, clocked off,

51:48.355 --> 51:50.357
and got the fuck out of there, I swear.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.194
Hmm.

51:57.656 --> 51:59.074
If you say so.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.580
Shit. The towels are all wet.

52:05.664 --> 52:08.291
Oh, I put them in before work.
They're in the drier.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.055
- I'll get 'em.
- You sure?

52:11.086 --> 52:13.380
Can't have my girl drying off
with no wet towel.

52:39.322 --> 52:40.407
Here.

52:51.418 --> 52:52.658
We gotta leave at 7:00.

52:52.711 --> 52:53.711
Okay.

52:57.007 --> 52:58.258
We'll eat there?

52:58.341 --> 52:59.341
Sure.

53:17.277 --> 53:18.445
Hmm...

53:19.237 --> 53:20.237
Come here.

53:38.882 --> 53:39.882
You know...

53:42.636 --> 53:44.804
You haven't finished your punishment yet.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.266
I'm not feeling so good.

53:48.350 --> 53:49.643
Maybe we can rain check?

53:51.311 --> 53:52.311
Hmm...

53:53.605 --> 53:55.899
You already made a fool of me once today.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.155
Please...

54:04.074 --> 54:05.700
Without order, what are we?

54:05.784 --> 54:07.702
Okay. Okay.

54:07.786 --> 54:09.037
What would we be?

54:10.455 --> 54:12.499
Animals.

54:12.999 --> 54:14.167
Animals.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.587
You don't wanna be an animal.

54:21.216 --> 54:22.216
No.

54:33.728 --> 54:35.021
Half-hour should do it.

54:35.689 --> 54:36.689
Come on.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.001
I said come on!

56:16.331 --> 56:17.691
<i>Good job by Hardy,</i>

56:17.749 --> 56:22.045
<i>and then she tried to
avoid the kick of Williams,</i>

56:22.128 --> 56:24.130
<i>but Williams was able to score.</i>

56:25.507 --> 56:28.510
<i>Now, what these kicks do
is they allow Williams</i>

56:28.593 --> 56:31.805
<i>to get in punching range
without Hardy stopping her jab.</i>

56:31.888 --> 56:33.098
<i>She wants to kick.</i>

56:34.432 --> 56:37.018
<i>She's in punching range, and she flows.</i>

56:37.102 --> 56:39.462
<i>And Williams mixing up
the punches and kicks</i>

56:39.521 --> 56:41.564
<i>while Hardy is punching wildly!</i>

56:41.648 --> 56:43.525
<i>Eats a couple of stiff elbows.</i>

56:44.359 --> 56:47.487
<i>Mid-point of what has been
a fantastic opening round.</i>

56:47.570 --> 56:49.256
<i>She's vicious, coming out...</i>

56:49.280 --> 56:50.949
<i>Speaking of vicious,</i>

56:51.032 --> 56:54.035
<i>a vicious exchange here
between Williams and Hardy!</i>

56:57.831 --> 56:59.958
<i>Hardy has not found her comfort zone.</i>

57:00.041 --> 57:01.584
<i>She's had flashes of offense.</i>

57:01.668 --> 57:04.963
<i>Certainly hasn't been in the pocket,
where she wants to be.</i>

57:05.046 --> 57:07.715
<i>Williams' composure really impressive...</i>

57:09.759 --> 57:12.720
The fuck you doing?
Get your stupid ass back up there!

57:13.221 --> 57:14.222
What the fuck?

57:18.685 --> 57:19.685
The fuck are you?

57:23.815 --> 57:25.650
Take the keys.

57:29.779 --> 57:31.281
- Slowly.
- Okay.

57:32.240 --> 57:33.283
Nice and slow.

57:33.366 --> 57:35.577
Okay, um...

57:36.578 --> 57:37.662
Put the beer down.

57:38.371 --> 57:40.707
- Okay, I'm putting it down.
- Okay.

57:41.374 --> 57:42.417
Slowly.

57:43.168 --> 57:44.711
- Okay.
- Beer's down.

57:45.044 --> 57:48.006
Okay. Get on the floor.

57:48.089 --> 57:49.089
You get down.

57:49.757 --> 57:52.051
Okay. You stay there.
Don't move, okay?

57:52.635 --> 57:53.635
Thank you.

57:54.053 --> 57:55.763
Okay, get up. Get up.

57:55.847 --> 57:57.765
- If you want the truck...
- Just get up!

57:58.349 --> 58:00.059
I want you to tell me...

58:00.143 --> 58:02.479
how to get to the garage.

58:02.562 --> 58:04.522
Can we get to the garage from the house?

58:05.231 --> 58:06.065
Mm-hmm.

58:06.149 --> 58:07.442
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

58:07.525 --> 58:08.651
Okay.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.236
You're gonna show me.

58:17.243 --> 58:18.661
Turn on the light.

58:23.666 --> 58:26.044
Okay. Let's go, down.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.604
We're going for a drive.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.568
I want you to follow my directions.

58:51.444 --> 58:53.071
I'm gonna take you somewhere.

58:53.947 --> 58:56.449
Okay? You just listen to what I tell you.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.118
So, get in the car.

58:59.953 --> 59:00.953
Just get in.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.741
Just... Just look ahead.

59:56.593 --> 59:59.137
Hey, uh, left at the T-junction.

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:04.559
- Where are we going?
- Just make a left.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.700
Pull over.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.341
Kill the engine.

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:34.857
Toss the keys back here slowly.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.201
Please...

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:47.954
Please...

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:50.748
Just tell me what you want.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.210
I can get you money.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:58.548
I can get you anything you want.
Please, just tell me.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.344
Get out of the truck.

01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:08.975
No. 'Cause if I do, you'll shoot me.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.769
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Get out of the truck.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.564
Why are you gonna kill me?

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.568
Just tell me
what I've done so I know, please.

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.029
Please don't kill me.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.782
- Stop crying.
- Please.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.535
- I don't wanna die!
- Stop... Stop crying.

01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:29.662
I can't help it
because you're gonna kill me.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.957
Look, I need you to hold yourself together

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.084
and get out of the fucking truck, okay?
You hear me?

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:38.713
Please, because, look, I know I've done
some fucked up things in this lifetime.

01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:40.715
Okay, I know I have.

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:44.177
But please, if you tell me,
I can fix it, I promise.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.580
Please, 'cause I don't wanna die!

01:02:45.636 --> 01:02:48.473
Okay, listen to me, you piece of shit!
I just want your fucking truck.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.542
No, no, no, no, no.

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.948
Oh, God!

01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:16.018
Where are you, you piece of sh...

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:34.787
Well...

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.873
you gave it your best shot, Kat.

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:46.465
Stay there. That's good. Hold that.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.094
Nice.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.140
Please.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:59.270
There has to be another way
to put this right.

01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:01.647
She's just a child.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.608
Please, there has to be...

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:05.610
some other way.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:07.778
Sorry, Kat.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.282
You know what you gotta do.

01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:01.916
Promise me...

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:04.669
she'll be all right.

01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:09.465
You promise me...

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.094
if I do this...

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.722
it'll be over...

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:19.767
and you'll leave her alone.

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:24.814
Fair's fair.

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:58.097
<i>Clara...</i>

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:04.311
<i>I want you to know
that I love you so, so, so much...</i>

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:07.106
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.068
<i>And...</i>

01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:15.614
<i>none of this is gonna makes sense
because it doesn't make any sense.</i>

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:22.997
<i>But I want you to know
that I didn't want to leave you.</i>

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:31.547
<i>And I had to do... I had to do...</i>

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.718
<i>I had to do what I had to do
to keep you safe.</i>

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:43.350
<i>I want you to remember me.</i>

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.938
<i>And keep me close to your heart</i>

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:49.940
<i>as best as you can.</i>

01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:54.361
<i>And, uh, don't let me fade.</i>

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:00.159
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.870
<i>I love you so, so, so much, sweetie.</i>

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:16.466
<i>Mommy.</i>

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:07.184
Come on, you crazy bitch!

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.229
Give me them fucking keys.

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:13.566
Now what, huh?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.651
You wanna fucking play?

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:18.819
The fuck you doing?

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:23.325
What the fuck?

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:08.889
Please, no.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:15.688
Please...

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:18.482
Please, just stop...

01:11:20.025 --> 01:11:21.527
Why are you doing this?

01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:24.405
Please stop. Please...

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.617
Please... Please...

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.497
Please stop.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:38.251
Please!

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.132
Why?

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:45.592
Why are you doing this?

01:11:47.428 --> 01:11:48.512
Why?

01:11:48.595 --> 01:11:50.597
Shh.

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:51.682
It's all right.

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:53.892
It'll all be over soon.

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:57.104
You're crazy, you fucking bitch.

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:01.734
You're gonna burn in hell for this.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:05.279
You're gonna fucking burn,
you fucking bitch.

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:09.325
You're gonna burn in hell for this!
You'll burn!

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.660
We'll see.

01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:41.453
Hello?

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.788
<i>Hello, Ms. Ridgeway?</i>

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:43.871
Speaking.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:46.416
<i>This is Dr. Hayes.
I'm calling about your daughter Clara.</i>

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.220
<i>I've been trying you
for around an hour now.</i>

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:49.378
Tell me.

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:50.461
<i>Sorry?</i>

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:53.339
How is she?

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.301
<i>She's fine. She's up, ready to go.</i>

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.985
<i>She's wondering where you are.</i>

01:15:58.011 --> 01:15:59.263
<i>So am I, for that matter.</i>

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:04.226
Tell her I'm on my way.

01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:05.309
I'll be there soon.

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.313
<i>Okay, will do.
I'll make sure she gets something to eat.</i>

01:16:09.856 --> 01:16:10.856
Thank you.

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.707
- Mommy!
- Hey, sweetie.

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:12.210
They gave me red jello and ice cream.

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:15.255
Ooh, they did, sweetie?

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:17.341
Yeah, and spaghetti for dinner.

01:17:17.424 --> 01:17:18.925
What happened to your neck?

01:17:19.676 --> 01:17:21.303
Oh, I scratched it.

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:22.971
Did it hurt?

01:17:24.097 --> 01:17:25.098
Yeah, a little.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.935
When are we leaving?
Do I have to stay in here?

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:33.357
No, we don't. We're free to go now.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:46.346
Yeah. No, you're right, Mom,

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:49.433
I should have called you right back,
but I just didn't want to bother you.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.476
But we're hitting the road now, yeah.

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.646
No. Promise you, everything is all good.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.570
What letter are we up to?

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.238
Mommy?

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.324
What, sweetie?

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:08.744
What letter were we up to?

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:10.954
Uh...

01:19:11.788 --> 01:19:12.706
I can't remember.

01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:13.832
You decide.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:15.708
Okay.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.880
Hitchhiker, Mommy.

01:19:19.963 --> 01:19:21.631
H for hitchhiker.

01:19:49.659 --> 01:19:51.161
Did you see him, Clara?

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:52.244
Did you see him?

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:53.789
Yeah.

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:58.043
Where do you think he's going, Mommy?

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:10.931
I'm not sure, sweetie.

01:20:15.852 --> 01:20:18.396
Your turn, Mommy. We're up to I.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.275
Mommy?

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:23.610
Come on, Mommy.

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:25.611
I...

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:31.450
I...

01:20:36.039 --> 01:20:37.039
I...
