WEBVTT

00:14.182 --> 00:16.117
Charlie, come on!

00:16.150 --> 00:17.585
(sonic boom)

00:19.153 --> 00:21.089
There he is.
(sighs)

00:21.122 --> 00:23.524
Larry just reentered
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.593
Welcome home.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.297
NEWSCASTER:
And the shuttle looks great

00:29.330 --> 00:31.299
as it approaches,
coming in just as expected...

00:31.332 --> 00:32.666
MILLIE:
Come on, come on.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.268
Weather's forcing
them to land

00:34.302 --> 00:35.636
at Edwards Air
Force Base.

00:35.669 --> 00:36.804
Road trip.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.472
Let's drive to the desert
and pick him up.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.840
CHARLIE: Yeah, you know, we can
rent a convertible

00:39.873 --> 00:41.675
and stop off in Vegas
and play some poker.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.611
Oh, yeah, right, now that
you're a poker champ, too.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.346
Oh.
-Hey, listen, I hate to break it

00:45.379 --> 00:46.780
to you, but I believe
NASA requires

00:46.814 --> 00:47.848
a couple of days of debriefing.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.550
AMITA: Well, that's okay,
well get him on the phone.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.651
Yeah, I mean,
it's not every day

00:50.684 --> 00:51.819
that your friend flies in
on a rocket

00:51.852 --> 00:53.454
at 17,000 miles
an hour.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.656
One small step
for Dr. Fleinhardt,

00:55.689 --> 00:57.858
one giant leap for Cal Sci.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.692
Oh, look, there he is!
-Hey!

00:58.726 --> 01:00.361
That's him!

01:00.394 --> 01:01.495
(glasses clink)

01:01.529 --> 01:03.397
NEWSCASTER: Two mission
specialists, Fleinhardt and...

01:03.431 --> 01:04.698
What's he got
in his hand?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.134
Is that macramГ©?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.735
...Sullivan, Bradley

01:07.768 --> 01:09.403
and Garcia-Romero...

01:09.437 --> 01:12.206
(buzzer sounds, man shouting)

01:12.240 --> 01:13.741
Who you going
to see?

01:13.774 --> 01:15.409
Pony FuГ±es.
-You escorting him

01:15.443 --> 01:16.877
to San Quentin
for the execution?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.746
No.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.613
MAN:
AUSA Brickle.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.781
Pony finally

01:20.814 --> 01:21.715
decide to rat?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.451
It's funny how death
will make a man want

01:23.484 --> 01:24.852
to clear
his conscience.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.420
Doesn't sound like Pony.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.558
MAN:
Ray, go ahead and open two.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.164
Pony FuГ±es has never cooperated
until now.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.831
Yeah, well, how do you know
he is cooperating?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.267
How do you know
he's not?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.335
This guy was a hit man
for all the mobs,

01:41.369 --> 01:42.836
Italian, Mexican,
Russian, Armenian--

01:42.870 --> 01:43.837
he's got hard-core
information

01:43.871 --> 01:46.240
on all of them.
-Yeah, or he's just playing us.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.309
I mean, the guy's got six days
to live, right?

01:48.342 --> 01:49.477
BRICKLE: Exactly. Nothing to
lose.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.744
He might as well
come clean.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.280
Yeah, well, that's
what we might do,

01:52.313 --> 01:54.448
but I'm saying a guy like
this wants something,

01:54.482 --> 01:56.650
and I'm not cutting
some hired gun any slack.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.785
This way.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.854
DON:
Where's he at?

02:00.888 --> 02:03.491
SHU prisoners are not allowed
human contact.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.825
You'll interview him

02:04.858 --> 02:06.494
like this.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.628
BRICKLE:
Can he hear us?

02:07.661 --> 02:08.762
Yeah, I can hear you.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.398
DON: What, but he can't see us?

02:10.431 --> 02:11.832
No.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.666
PONY: Hardly seems fair, right?

02:12.700 --> 02:13.567
DON:
Yeah, go figure.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.203
Mr. FuГ±es,

02:15.236 --> 02:18.339
I'm AUSA Brickle of
the Department of Justice.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.741
With me is Special Agent
Don Eppes of the FBI.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.810
I understand you're interested
in cooperating with us

02:22.843 --> 02:24.878
on several unsolved murders.
Is that right?

02:24.912 --> 02:26.714
Check it out, man,
I ain't no rat.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.382
First of all,
let's get that straight.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.817
Uh, I'm only going
to talk to you all

02:29.850 --> 02:31.252
about what I myself
have done.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.486
BRICKLE:
Okay.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.621
How many?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.888
Well, I'll give you all
five bodies

02:34.922 --> 02:37.858
so those families can get
some peace.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.793
So they can bury
their dead properly.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.229
Yeah, how do we know
you're not just taking credit

02:41.262 --> 02:42.463
so you can get someone else off?

02:42.496 --> 02:45.233
Details no one else knows.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.567
I also have a...

02:46.600 --> 02:49.470
photographic memory of my work.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.571
Okay, fine.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.639
Let's, uh,

02:51.672 --> 02:53.541
let's go ahead
and get started.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.609
Just slow down,
not so fast, friend.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.878
You got to give me something. I
want a visit

02:57.911 --> 03:00.814
with my daughter. I ain't never
seen my daughter before.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.950
I want to talk to her in person.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.618
O-Okay.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.487
I'm gonna have to see about
that, but I don't think it'll be

03:06.520 --> 03:07.855
a problem.
Not in here.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.857
Not in no damn cage.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.992
I'm talking about outside
of a prison.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.827
DON:
No way.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.729
Ain't gonna happen.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.830
I'll give you five dead.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.567
That's a fair trade.
-Okay,

03:19.600 --> 03:20.834
okay, you know what,
Mr. FuГ±es,

03:20.868 --> 03:22.403
give me one second
I'll be right back. Don.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.637
Don, hey, hey, hey.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.639
Hey, hey.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.740
What?

03:26.774 --> 03:28.909
Five bodies, that's...

03:28.942 --> 03:30.711
that is a lot
of unsolved murder.

03:30.744 --> 03:31.979
Come on, the guy's a con,

03:32.012 --> 03:33.714
he's lying
through his teeth.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.349
Well, yeah, he's a con
that's going to be dead

03:35.383 --> 03:36.417
on Tuesday, you know,
this is it.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.551
This is our...

03:37.585 --> 03:39.420
this is our last shot on this
one. -Yeah,

03:39.453 --> 03:40.388
and what if he's just
using his own kid

03:40.421 --> 03:41.955
to try to break out of here
or something?

03:43.857 --> 03:47.328
What if he has to give us a body
to prove good faith?

03:47.361 --> 03:48.962
You think he'd go
for that?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.664
So, what you're saying
just to clear

03:50.698 --> 03:52.666
one case? -Yeah, take it one
step at a time,

03:52.700 --> 03:53.667
(phone rings)
see where it goes.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.668
I don't know.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.703
All right,
let me take a shot

03:55.736 --> 03:56.670
at this.
-All right.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.506
Eppes. CHARLIE: Hey, what's up,
man? It's me.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.908
So, Larry's back,
we saw him land this morning.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.742
Ah, cool.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.377
Yeah, I haven't gotten him
-Excellent.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.412
on the phone yet,

04:04.445 --> 04:05.413
but I'm thinking of throwing him

04:05.446 --> 04:06.246
a welcome home dinner

04:06.280 --> 04:07.748
when he shows.
You want to come by?

04:07.781 --> 04:08.649
Uh, I don't know, buddy,

04:08.682 --> 04:09.850
I got a problem here.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.018
What's the problem?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.353
Well, we just got
this death row guy

04:12.386 --> 04:13.587
who's trying
to talk me

04:13.621 --> 04:15.356
into getting him off site,
but I don't know.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.490
I think we're being set up.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.292
Well, to do that...

04:18.326 --> 04:19.893
wouldn't he have to collude
with someone on the outside?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.329
Yeah, well, I mean
these guys are faster

04:21.362 --> 04:23.063
than the post office
getting info in and out.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.333
Yeah, but you know, the prison
is designed with obstacles

04:25.366 --> 04:26.300
to his communication.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.736
Look, I can perform
a Vulnerability Analysis

04:28.769 --> 04:29.903
on the prison systems...

04:29.937 --> 04:33.006
Wait, I gotta call you back.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.342
He's giving us Benny Wong.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.709
The guy who ran the
Chinese gang?

04:38.379 --> 04:39.980
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:40.013 --> 04:42.950
COLBY: Got human bone fragments.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.552
Bullet hole in
the cranium.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.519
Lemme see that.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.754
Don, we found
the body right

04:46.787 --> 04:48.021
where FuГ±es said.

04:48.055 --> 04:48.889
One shot to the skull.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.493
COLBY:
Look at that.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.027
Looks like Wong's jacket.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.630
Right here, another bullet hole
in the chest.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.633
I tapped Benny once in the head,
once in the chest.

05:01.569 --> 05:02.636
He had on a...

05:02.670 --> 05:05.639
black and red leather coat.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.408
Tough guy, Benny,

05:07.441 --> 05:09.643
Very, very bad taste
in clothing, though.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.613
Uh...

05:12.646 --> 05:14.114
I got four more for
you all, but I got one

05:14.147 --> 05:15.749
that I know
you're really gonna like.

05:15.783 --> 05:16.817
'Cause it's a big one.

05:16.850 --> 05:17.851
What's this big one, Mr. FuГ±es?

05:17.885 --> 05:19.420
You remember that
Congressman's

05:19.453 --> 05:21.655
kid that went missing?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.625
Randal Amato's son?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.959
Yeah. I know where
that boy is.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.960
BRICKLE:
Are you,

05:26.994 --> 05:28.429
are you telling me he's alive?

05:28.462 --> 05:30.764
I'm telling you...

05:30.798 --> 05:32.800
it's your move, Eppes.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.741
BRICKLE: It was ten
years ago, Mafia,

05:40.774 --> 05:41.975
they tried
to buy off

05:42.009 --> 05:43.644
freshman Congressman
Randal Amato--

05:43.677 --> 05:45.746
he refused, they attempted
to persuade him

05:45.779 --> 05:47.114
by taking
his five-year-old son.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.816
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
-They could never

05:48.849 --> 05:50.751
prove murder, could never
find the boy's body.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.120
Now, I, I would love
to hang this on Phil Berelli

05:53.153 --> 05:54.488
where it belongs.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.823
The guy's a shot caller.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.691
Why, how's he get his
hands dirty with this?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.593
Ten years ago
he was an up and comer,

05:59.627 --> 06:00.694
and he bragged
on a wiretap

06:00.728 --> 06:02.496
about teaching Amato
a lesson.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.498
Yeah, and how does
Pony factor in?

06:04.532 --> 06:06.734
That's what I need
to find out.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.168
I don't know,
I got to tell you,

06:08.201 --> 06:10.604
I got a bad feeling
about this guy.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.805
LARRY (on answering machine):
Greetings,

06:11.839 --> 06:13.173
gravity-bound Homo sapiens.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.675
I am orbiting
your lovely blue planet

06:14.708 --> 06:17.578
until the middle
of Earth Year 2007.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.681
You may leave a message here or
simply call out to the heavens.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.115
I will be listening.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.551
(beep)

06:23.584 --> 06:25.853
Hey, Larry, uh,
so it's me again.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.721
I saw you set foot
on terra firma, buddy.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.558
So, if NASA's holding you
hostage, just give me a shout,

06:30.591 --> 06:31.925
I'll come break you out--

06:31.959 --> 06:33.026
whatever you need.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.194
Just call me, okay?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.796
Call me, all right?

06:35.829 --> 06:36.797
Hey.
DON: Hey.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.165
I want you
to meet Al Brickle.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.800
He's AUSA.
This is my brother, Charlie.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.669
Oh, yeah and it's,
it's Alvin.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.103
Good to meet you,
your reputation proceeds you.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.572
Oh, well...

06:44.605 --> 06:46.206
So...
So, I, I, uh...

06:46.239 --> 06:48.709
I analyzed
the Secure Housing Unit

06:48.742 --> 06:50.043
at the prison.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.179
It's a hyper-secure
system,

06:52.212 --> 06:53.781
but... BRICKLE: Prisoners have
nothing to do

06:53.814 --> 06:54.782
except sit around
and think

06:54.815 --> 06:56.016
about how to
break it, right?

06:56.049 --> 06:57.084
Right.
Nice suit there,

06:57.117 --> 06:57.785
Brickle.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.487
Nice face.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.889
It's like two opposing armies,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.892
where one army tries to get
a spy past enemy lines.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.928
Now, calculating the ratio
of points of vulnerability

07:07.961 --> 07:10.764
versus resources required
to defend those points

07:10.798 --> 07:13.534
determines probabilities
of penetration.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.902
Now, my model indicates

07:14.935 --> 07:17.605
that in this SHU
there are fewer

07:17.638 --> 07:20.541
than two percent of prisoners
that can sustain

07:20.574 --> 07:21.875
illicit
communications.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.611
Now, that's three times less

07:23.644 --> 07:24.912
than at your average
high-security prison.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.847
98%,
that's pretty good.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.081
Maybe Pony's on the up and up.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.083
However, there
is one variable

07:30.117 --> 07:31.552
that doesn't fit into my model.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.953
Guards.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.888
And lawyers.

07:34.922 --> 07:35.856
That's the human factor.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.126
Guards are squeaky
clean, though, and the

07:39.159 --> 07:40.594
prison oversight
on the SHU guards

07:40.628 --> 07:41.662
is much harsher than normal.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.863
What's the deal
with Pony's lawyer?

07:42.896 --> 07:45.566
No, he's been representing
himself for the last two years.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.502
Which is why he's riding
the express train to execution.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.069
CHARLIE:
Well, that means

07:49.102 --> 07:51.639
with over 90% assurance

07:51.672 --> 07:53.974
that he is not communicating
with the outside world.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.676
COLBY:
So we transport him here

07:55.709 --> 07:57.711
to meet his daughter... or not?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.616
I don't care
what he did;

08:02.650 --> 08:03.784
he's my only father.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.085
You'd better care
what he did.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.153
Let's just take it easy.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.555
They're gonna
kill him!

08:07.588 --> 08:09.156
Do you know how many
people he killed?

08:09.189 --> 08:11.959
Lucy!

08:11.992 --> 08:14.595
Damn it.
(door slamming)

08:14.628 --> 08:17.731
I understand you don't want
your daughter to see him.

08:17.765 --> 08:18.999
It's all
she thinks about.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.968
The execution's on the news
every day--

08:21.001 --> 08:23.837
lethal injection or not,
doctors present or not,

08:23.871 --> 08:25.573
will the governor stop it
or not?

08:25.606 --> 08:27.207
He's requested a firing squad
like Gary Gilmore.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.610
We don't do that
in California, ma'am.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.179
Agent Sinclair, the sooner my
ex-husband is gone, the better.

08:34.281 --> 08:37.985
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that,
I'm not like that.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.989
It's just watching my daughter
go through this...

08:42.022 --> 08:45.258
I can't even imagine,
Mrs. FuГ±es.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.727
Moreno.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.196
I went back to my maiden name
when I divorced him.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.831
Ms. Moreno,

08:50.864 --> 08:53.266
has he been in touch with
you or Lucy, at all?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.035
Through the mail...

08:55.068 --> 08:56.937
uh, telephone, maybe some

08:56.970 --> 08:58.138
old friends?
No.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.873
He doesn't know
where we are.

09:00.841 --> 09:01.975
Can you give this
to him?

09:02.009 --> 09:02.943
No,

09:02.976 --> 09:04.878
Lucy, please.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.279
Can you?

09:06.313 --> 09:09.182
I really think that's
up to your mom.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.256
Give him the photo,

09:16.289 --> 09:17.925
but I won't
allow her to be

09:17.958 --> 09:19.359
in the same
room with him.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.894
DAVID:
Understood.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.832
(buzzer sounds,
handcuffs jangling)

09:24.865 --> 09:27.935
(men shouting)

09:27.968 --> 09:29.970
You won't regret this.
-Yeah.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.739
Well, we'll see
about that.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.773
PRISONER:
Good luck, Pony.

09:32.806 --> 09:33.674
Nice knowing ya.
-All right.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.208
PRISONER 2: You getting the
firing squad?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.343
Hell, nah,

09:36.376 --> 09:37.711
the needle.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.079
Hey, shut up,
all right?

09:39.112 --> 09:40.981
PRISONER 3: Why you leaving with
the Feds, FuГ±es?

09:41.014 --> 09:42.115
Decided to rat,

09:42.149 --> 09:43.717
you wimp?!

09:43.751 --> 09:45.285
No, I ain't no rat,

09:45.318 --> 09:46.319
pinhead bastard.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.187
He told you

09:47.220 --> 09:47.955
to shut up.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.122
I ain't no rat.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.128
(siren blares)

10:07.107 --> 10:11.745
(garbled radio transmission)

10:11.779 --> 10:13.881
PONY:
Oh, man.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.015
Years.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.917
I've spent years
in that hole, man.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.686
Pony, shut your mouth
or I'm gonna put

10:18.719 --> 10:20.120
a bag over your head,
you hear me?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.875
*

10:45.045 --> 10:47.715
AGENT (over radio):
All teams, stand by...

10:47.748 --> 10:50.017
prisoner has just arrived...

10:55.122 --> 10:57.424
Okay, okay, all right, boys.
-Hey...

10:57.457 --> 10:59.392
This is a nice day.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.733
(indistinct radio transmission)

11:08.301 --> 11:09.903
Hey, hey, hey!
-Where's my son?

11:09.937 --> 11:11.104
DAVID: This is Congressman
Randal Amato. -Listen.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.140
I understand.
-I want to know where my son is!

11:13.173 --> 11:14.141
DON:
Sir, as soon

11:14.174 --> 11:15.142
as I know something,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.344
you'll be the first person
I tell, all right?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.880
Director's Office
okayed it.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.314
FuГ±es's ex-wife won't
let him see the kid.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.750
Well, this just
keeps getting better

11:22.783 --> 11:23.616
and better, doesn't it?

11:23.650 --> 11:25.018
The kid gave this
for her dad, though.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.120
All right, well,

11:27.154 --> 11:29.122
just make sure
he's all right.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.390
LARRY (on answering machine):
Greetings, gravity-bound

11:30.423 --> 11:31.258
Homo sapiens.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.927
I am orbiting
your lovely blue planet

11:33.961 --> 11:36.063
until the middle
of Earth Year 2007.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.397
You may leave a message here
or...

11:39.499 --> 11:41.068
Hey.
DON: Hey.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.402
Colby, you want
to deal with this?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.237
So, what's up?

11:44.271 --> 11:46.740
So, I may not be able
to read this guy's mind,

11:46.774 --> 11:49.009
but I can offer you
the best strategy

11:49.042 --> 11:51.078
in a confrontation like this.
-All right, what is it?

11:51.111 --> 11:52.412
Tit for tat.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.147
Say what?
Tit for tat--

11:54.181 --> 11:55.916
it's the most winning strategy
in game theory

11:55.949 --> 11:56.950
for the Prisoner's Dilemma.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.052
It dominates in
every tournament

11:59.086 --> 12:00.921
against far more
complex methods.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.122
Let's say,

12:02.155 --> 12:03.356
you're in a race climbing
a mountain

12:03.390 --> 12:04.424
against another climber.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.027
You can't scale
the rock face alone,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.196
but you do want to be the first
person to get to the top.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.298
Your first move
should be cooperative,

12:11.331 --> 12:13.300
then you mimic
all your opponent's actions.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.869
So, if he aggresses,
you aggress;

12:15.903 --> 12:17.838
if he cooperates, so do you.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.172
So, if he attacks,

12:19.206 --> 12:20.473
and, and then
cooperates,

12:20.507 --> 12:22.009
you're still supposed
to cooperate?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.977
Yeah, it's, totally
counterintuitive,

12:24.011 --> 12:25.813
but forgiveness is necessary

12:25.846 --> 12:27.047
for the optimal
result.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.048
What do you mean forgiveness?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.850
I mean people don't often
forgive betrayal,

12:29.883 --> 12:32.119
but in Tit for Tat, if your
opponent cooperates again,

12:32.152 --> 12:33.186
so do you.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.055
That way, he learns
that he gets more

12:35.088 --> 12:36.824
if he works with you.
-Yeah, but, Charlie,

12:36.857 --> 12:38.458
the guy's a sociopath;
I can't trust him.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.559
Well, that's,
that's the beauty of it.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.861
You don't have to trust
this guy.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.195
Just mirror his actions.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.196
He gave me a body,
I brought him here.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.198
So based on what you're saying,
it's his turn?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.334
That's right, so let's see

12:47.367 --> 12:49.202
if he aggresses
or if he cooperates.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.539
All right,
I'll see what happens.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.243
How're you doing?
Everything all right?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.279
DON:
Where's the congressman's son?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.450
I gave you Benny Wong
on good faith.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.218
Yeah, I took you out of the SHU,
so it's your turn.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.220
So I lay you out
another body,

13:07.254 --> 13:08.521
do I get to see my kid?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.157
Oh, that depends how good
your information is.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.094
I can give you Jimmy Morales.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.128
No, I want the kid.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.464
I don't trust you, man.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.266
The bottom line,
I don't trust you,

13:19.299 --> 13:20.901
'cause you ain't
gave me nothing.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.135
Give me your word.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.943
All right, look, Pony,
here's the way it is.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.144
You cooperate with me,

13:31.178 --> 13:33.346
I promise you,
I will cooperate with you.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.284
Okay.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.853
You got to know I ain't want
to do that to that kid.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.122
You know, Berelli just didn't
have the nerves to do it.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.092
He was scaring the kid.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.127
I could just see it was going to
be a big mess.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.929
Yeah, so?

13:48.962 --> 13:51.331
PONY: I walked the kid down the
hillside.

13:51.364 --> 13:54.067
I was talking to him
about the Man in the Moon

13:54.101 --> 13:55.936
and when he looked up,

13:55.969 --> 13:57.437
I snapped his neck.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.507
Yeah... he never felt a thing.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.378
Where's this hillside?

14:07.915 --> 14:10.183
My wife and I
have imagined

14:10.217 --> 14:13.486
the worst for ten years.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.156
Nothing is worse
than not knowing.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.159
Hey, guys.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.128
This is not a child's body.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.867
Oh, God.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.615
(sizzling, coughing)

14:42.649 --> 14:43.583
Oh! Charlie!

14:43.616 --> 14:45.585
Oh, shoot!

14:45.618 --> 14:47.254
I'm sorry, are they ruined?
I don't know.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.356
The smoke got in my eyes.
-Are you all right?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.024
Maybe we can save them.
(groaning)

14:51.058 --> 14:52.359
No. -It looks like the Petrified
Forest.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.461
Yeah. God, I put them on

14:54.494 --> 14:58.331
and then I got preoccupied
with a problem in the garage.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.600
Where is Larry?
So much for the celebration.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.269
Yeah, have you heard from him?

15:02.302 --> 15:04.571
I guess he's still being
debriefed by NASA.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.639
I don't know why he can't call.
DON: Hey.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.475
ALAN: Hi.
-Whoa, what's up?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.476
Charlie was trying
to barbecue,

15:09.509 --> 15:11.411
so, uh... we're going to
have to order in now.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.613
Thai food?
I'll get the menus.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.149
CHARLIE: Don't even bother.
Grab the gas.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.285
Thanks. Barbecue ribs.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.020
Not anymore.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.222
Hey, are you sure about
all this Tit for Tat stuff?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.391
Teams have spent years
trying to defeat it.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.193
Even by cheating,
yet it still remains

15:26.226 --> 15:29.129
the best way to achieve optimal
results for both parties.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.230
You know, some theorists

15:30.263 --> 15:32.032
believe it gives insight

15:32.065 --> 15:34.501
to how groups of animals,
how groups of humans,

15:34.534 --> 15:37.104
have come to live in largely
cooperative societies.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.007
How about this? The guy lied
to us about where the kid was.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.742
Right, so we find
another body in its place.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.177
Now how do you factor that in,

15:44.211 --> 15:46.113
aggression or cooperation?
Well, if he lied,

15:46.146 --> 15:48.215
that's aggression,
you need to aggress on him.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.083
Yeah, all right, well,
that I can do. Okay.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.052
Is that all you came by for?

15:52.085 --> 15:53.153
No, where's Larry?

15:53.186 --> 15:54.287
He's not here yet.
-All right, well,

15:54.321 --> 15:57.124
I'm gonna have to come back or
I'll call you later, okay?

15:57.157 --> 15:57.790
Okay.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.526
Okay, so we got three Chi..

15:59.559 --> 16:01.261
Where's he going?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.636
(faint rustling)

16:09.669 --> 16:11.338
(gasps)
You lied!

16:11.371 --> 16:13.040
I'm sending you
straight to San Quentin

16:13.073 --> 16:15.242
and they're going to fill your
veins with potassium chloride.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.276
You hear me?
I did not lie...

16:16.309 --> 16:17.177
Forget seeing your daughter!

16:17.210 --> 16:18.411
I did not lie!
Uh-huh.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.247
I don't know what happened.
Maybe somebody moved the body.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.448
Who?
Berelli.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.216
He's the only one knew
where the kid was.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.085
We found a guy with gold teeth,
not a five-year-old.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.386
Well, you've got
to dig deeper, man.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.221
Give me your wrists.
You've got to-- look, man.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.357
Berelli could've stacked
the body on top of the kid.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.558
Uh-huh.
Ow!

16:31.591 --> 16:33.460
It's a good dumping ground.
Dig deeper.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.561
You make yourself comfortable.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.463
(growling)

16:36.496 --> 16:38.065
(angry grunt)

16:43.670 --> 16:45.638
Sinclair.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.806
Did you ID him?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.241
Yeah, we have a DNA match.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.143
Yeah, who is it?
Take a look.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.317
That's, that's
Lorenzo Marcellus.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.486
Yeah, Marcellus,
he was the West Coast boss

16:59.519 --> 17:01.488
before Berelli, right?

17:01.521 --> 17:02.722
That's how Berelli
made his bones,

17:02.755 --> 17:05.392
by killing Marcellus
and taking his territory.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.094
How is Pony connected?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.761
Pony would do a hit
for the Girl Scouts

17:08.795 --> 17:10.763
as long as they had enough
cookie money to pay him.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.133
Berelli probably hired
Pony to grab the Amato kid.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.668
All right,
but what about Marcellus?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.070
Berelli did
that one himself;

17:17.104 --> 17:19.072
at least that's
what he said on tape.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.707
I've got a wall of RICO
files just on him.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.342
I cannot believe...

17:22.375 --> 17:24.277
I'm going to finally
get this guy.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.178
This is huge.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.147
Yeah?
Huge.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.187
Morning.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.788
Hey, anything?

17:35.822 --> 17:38.158
Nope.
Here, I got you.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.592
All right, thanks.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.595
We dug all night. Didn't
find any other body.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.631
No evidence of reburying.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.300
I just don't think
the Amato kid was ever there.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.103
Well, you know the guy you found
was Lorenzo Marcellus.

17:50.137 --> 17:54.274
I just don't get why he
lies about the kid, though.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.176
Is it possible
that he's still alive?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.645
Maybe he was hired to kill him
and couldn't go through with it?

17:58.678 --> 17:59.646
Sent him away?

17:59.679 --> 18:02.682
Yeah, if this were a movie.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.651
I don't know,
FuГ±es was a contract man,

18:04.684 --> 18:06.886
strictly professional,
hired to hit the bad guys.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.355
Maybe he just couldn't
do the kid.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.490
Yeah, I don't know.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.824
I have a court order

18:11.858 --> 18:13.793
for FuГ±es to take
a polygraph.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.769
Psst. Charles.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.204
Hey!

18:24.237 --> 18:26.339
Larry! Hey! Hey!

18:26.373 --> 18:28.375
Careful, listen,
I've lost considerable

18:28.408 --> 18:30.377
bone density in space,
so be careful.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.912
Hey, why didn't you call? Amita
and I were going

18:32.945 --> 18:33.980
to come get you.

18:34.013 --> 18:34.714
No, no, I had a most pleasant
bus ride from Edwards.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.449
You took the bus?
Yeah, well,

18:36.483 --> 18:38.318
one can be
silent aboard the bus.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.387
One can order food,
get directions,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.389
make friends...

18:42.422 --> 18:43.623
I'll tell you, you know,

18:43.656 --> 18:46.125
language is in many ways
superfluous.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.928
So how was it? How are you?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.663
And how was...
how was your LISA work?

18:50.697 --> 18:53.466
Were you able to collect data on
gravitational pulls?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.802
I-I can understand if you can't
tell me, I won't press.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.238
But Larry, man, you
were in outer space!

18:58.271 --> 19:00.273
Looking out the
porthole, seeing...

19:00.307 --> 19:02.242
I've always wondered what...
what a shooting star

19:02.275 --> 19:03.776
looks like from out there.
Is it bigger?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.412
Can you see the burn
from the back?

19:05.445 --> 19:07.447
What is the-the difference
in perspective

19:07.480 --> 19:09.182
on heavenly bodies
and phenomena?

19:09.216 --> 19:12.285
Is it negligible, or is there
that sense of, uh, of, of...

19:12.319 --> 19:13.386
Of awe.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.322
"Of awe," right, yeah.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.323
What is this?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.757
Oh, this is an Aztec quipu.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.259
"Quipu"?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.193
Quipu, that's correct.
Okay.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.296
See, back in the glory days
of Tenochtitlan,

19:23.330 --> 19:26.333
these knots represented
a code for commerce,

19:26.366 --> 19:28.568
and the buying and selling
of jaguars

19:28.601 --> 19:30.737
and parrots and yuca.
Yuca.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.539
Yes, ultimately it served a
higher purpose

19:32.572 --> 19:34.207
in concealing secrets

19:34.241 --> 19:36.443
from the colonizing
Spaniards, but...

19:36.476 --> 19:38.278
each braid, each knot--

19:38.311 --> 19:40.513
each one of these tells a story.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.848
Well, where'd you get it?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.283
NASA's so nosy.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.285
This was all
in the pursuit of privacy.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.386
You made that?
Eh...

19:46.419 --> 19:47.587
Wow! What does it signify?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.589
Ah, now Charles,
would you read my diary?

19:49.622 --> 19:51.391
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.927
Well, look, Amita
is dying to see you.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.298
Millie wants to throw, like, a
school-wide party for you.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.267
And I should tell you that
Megan...

20:00.300 --> 20:01.334
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.603
You know, I really just
wanted to say hello to you,

20:03.636 --> 20:04.704
invite you to dinner.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.939
I'm in really no frame of mind

20:06.973 --> 20:09.509
for more complex social
interaction, not at the moment.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.844
Yeah, okay.
Sure, hey, cool.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.945
Cool, where you staying?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.848
Oh, I have a place
at the beach.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.684
Nice, hey, man...

20:17.717 --> 20:19.686
Ah, man, I missed you.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.555
I really... I really
missed you, man.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.462
AMATO:
Why is this taking so long?

20:29.496 --> 20:31.331
DON: Well, Congressman, you've
got to understand

20:31.364 --> 20:32.532
there's a process involved
and basically...

20:32.565 --> 20:34.501
He just described the location
of another body.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.803
All right, why don't you send
a team over, check it out.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.338
Did he mention my son?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.307
No, they're just getting
to that now, sir.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.541
Can I see you for a second?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.810
Yeah, sure, excuse me.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.978
PONY:
I walked the boy down the hill.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.980
Uh, I was talking to him

20:48.014 --> 20:49.882
about the Man in the Moon.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.684
He looked up,

20:51.718 --> 20:52.919
I snapped his neck.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.354
You son of a bitch!

20:54.387 --> 20:56.289
Hey!
He was only five!

20:56.323 --> 20:57.890
Congressman...
He was only five!

20:57.924 --> 20:59.459
PONY:
Tell him-- look, man...

20:59.492 --> 21:01.528
The boy didn't feel no pain.
I calmed him down.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.995
It was going to happen
with or without me.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.064
Sir, you can't do this.
All right, sir?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.400
Let's focus back here,
Mr. FuГ±es. Sit down, please.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.474
The boy's body was
not found where you said.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.908
Were you lying about that?

21:15.942 --> 21:18.445
No.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.814
(beeping)

21:21.848 --> 21:23.750
You gonna eat or
you gonna play?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.552
(siren wails)

21:25.585 --> 21:27.520
(tires screech)

21:28.421 --> 21:30.390
FBI, gentlemen.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.792
Philip Berelli, you're
under arrest for the murder

21:32.825 --> 21:33.960
of Lorenzo Marcellus.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.595
Again?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.465
Don't pull that chain
unless you want the whole dog.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.466
BERELLI:
I'll be out

21:39.499 --> 21:41.334
in three hours. BRICKLE: Not
this time, Berelli.

21:41.368 --> 21:44.504
I have Lorenzo,
gold-capped teeth and all.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.439
What did he have to do
with the, uh, Amato

21:46.473 --> 21:47.507
child's disappearance?
You know,

21:47.540 --> 21:48.608
we have a lot
to talk about, Phil.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.777
BERELLI:
Rat bastard FuГ±es.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.546
Couldn't keep his mouth shut
for four more days.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.615
Guess he figured you can't hurt
him if he's going to be dead

21:55.648 --> 21:56.683
by the middle of next week.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.518
A lot can happen in a week.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.438
*

22:32.452 --> 22:33.720
Hey.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.789
Good morning.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.458
Have you been
out here all night?

22:38.491 --> 22:41.694
The sun rose every 90 minutes

22:41.728 --> 22:43.396
on the Space Station, Charles.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.131
I find nights to be

22:45.164 --> 22:47.434
exquisitely consoling
back here on Earth.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.501
You were
going to wake me

22:48.535 --> 22:50.670
before you were
ready to go, right?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.672
I'm just...

22:52.705 --> 22:55.475
I'm not ready for
this, Charles...

22:55.508 --> 22:56.643
I'm not.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.878
Not for any of it.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.414
Larry...

23:01.448 --> 23:03.416
Larry, this is crazy.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.884
This is...
This is nuts.

23:04.917 --> 23:05.952
You're staying
at our house.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.822
Look, after months of living
in a metal capsule,

23:09.856 --> 23:11.157
the thought of confined spaces

23:11.190 --> 23:13.192
is simply intolerable to me.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.028
God, I... I don't know
what's going on.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.164
I feel like I'm in some
dream with the ghost Larry,

23:18.197 --> 23:20.633
and I just want to wake up
and talk to the real guy.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.437
Well, perceptive,
as always, Charles.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.572
Well, what...

23:25.605 --> 23:27.139
what's the matter, man?

23:27.173 --> 23:29.809
You can talk to me.
Come on.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.144
Well, I suppose
it's all there in the quipu,

23:32.178 --> 23:33.646
isn't it?

23:33.680 --> 23:34.647
There.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.516
That's my first telescope.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.018
I was three years old.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.152
President of the rocket club--

23:40.186 --> 23:41.488
fifth grade.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.490
Docent at the planetarium--

23:43.523 --> 23:44.924
junior high.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.158
Then way over here,

23:46.192 --> 23:49.796
four months and 12 days

23:49.829 --> 23:51.864
on the Space Station.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.000
I entered my dream.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.235
I experienced

23:56.268 --> 23:59.105
transcendence, Charles, okay?

23:59.138 --> 24:03.042
I... My being became
bigger than my body,

24:03.075 --> 24:05.912
it became bigger
than my history.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.213
You see?

24:07.246 --> 24:10.449
And I am loathe
to become small again.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.222
Are we all so bad down here?

24:16.255 --> 24:19.125
The beauty and fragility
of life on Earth,

24:19.158 --> 24:21.160
it takes my breath away.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.499
So what's your problem?

24:26.533 --> 24:29.636
That I will habituate

24:29.669 --> 24:31.604
and lose the vision.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.111
(cell phone ringing)

24:42.615 --> 24:45.117
They need me at the FBI.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.085
Come on.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.625
Hey, spaceman,
welcome back to Earth.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.459
Look at you, buddy.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.161
Come here, give us some love.
-Hey...

24:55.194 --> 24:57.163
He just wants
to keep a low profile.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.566
He was with me when you called,
so... Sounded urgent.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.167
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Absolutely. Yeah.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.268
Um, come on.

25:02.301 --> 25:05.738
I got Don following an
Equivalent Retaliation protocol.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.106
Oh, yeah, Tit for Tat, huh?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.174
Yeah.
Yeah.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.710
Its inventor, Anatol Rappaport,
just passed away.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.111
I read his obit online in space.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.580
That's the guy.

25:13.613 --> 25:14.714
And he passed his poly.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.716
Polygraph is a blunt instrument.
-Right.

25:16.749 --> 25:17.817
Exactly. So...

25:17.850 --> 25:19.018
Hey. How are you?

25:19.051 --> 25:20.186
Can I see you
for one second?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.187
DON: Yeah, I'll be right there.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.823
What's up?
-Yeah, FuГ±es.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.291
Agitated, he wants
to see his daughter.

25:25.324 --> 25:28.194
Nuh-uh, not until he gives us
that boy, no way. -Right, right.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.328
Listen, I was thinking
maybe I could take

25:29.361 --> 25:30.296
another run at the ex-wife.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.698
Yeah?
-If we have the girl,

25:31.731 --> 25:32.732
we have more leverage.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.133
All right, well, take David;

25:34.166 --> 25:35.134
he's been
there before.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.102
All right, all right.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.976
DON: I thought you wanted to see
your kid.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.078
You're damn right. I gave you
everything you asked for.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.648
No, you faked out a polygraph
test, that's all you did.

25:48.681 --> 25:49.816
You gave me your word.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.350
Now, what more do you
want from me?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.652
DON:
I want the truth.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.720
PONY:
I told you the truth!

25:53.753 --> 25:55.287
Yeah, well, the
body wasn't there!

25:55.321 --> 25:56.756
You lied to me!
I'm tired of this!

25:56.789 --> 25:57.657
(knocking)

26:03.262 --> 26:04.296
Guy's a liar, a con!

26:04.330 --> 26:05.832
He should have
his head cracked!

26:07.099 --> 26:08.601
You're awfully emotional.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.501
Yeah, you bet.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.270
Look, you're in
a death spiral, all right?

26:11.303 --> 26:12.338
That's what we call

26:12.371 --> 26:13.906
a Grim Trigger Strategy.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.008
Mm-hmm. -All right, he lied,
you're never gonna

26:16.042 --> 26:17.710
forgive him,
that's it, that's game over.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.378
Yeah, fine, good, game over.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.379
Can I tell you
the best way

26:20.412 --> 26:22.815
to get out of a negative spiral?

26:22.849 --> 26:24.183
Tit for two Tats.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.184
Are you kidding me?

26:25.217 --> 26:26.385
No.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.220
You cooperate twice in a row,

26:28.254 --> 26:30.657
despite his defection,
you give him something he wants.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.291
You're at
a dead end, man.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.161
You might as well
test the theory.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.599
Yeah, all right.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.145
Turn it over.

26:59.686 --> 27:00.386
Thank you.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.891
Where's that boy, Pony?

27:04.924 --> 27:05.958
I told you all I know.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.001
DAVID:
Brickle, this woman

27:15.034 --> 27:17.403
does not want her daughter in
the same room with FuГ±es.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.672
Okay? She's made that
abundantly clear.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.041
If it means he confesses more
murder, she may be persuaded.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.010
I just want to talk to her.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.812
What name's
she using now?

27:25.845 --> 27:28.347
Renee Moreno.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.682
What are you looking at?

27:29.716 --> 27:31.350
Got a red SUV,

27:31.383 --> 27:33.385
he's been following us
for a few miles now.

27:33.419 --> 27:34.186
You're kidding.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.755
No.

27:35.788 --> 27:36.989
You're not kidding.

27:37.023 --> 27:37.990
It could be Berelli's men,

27:38.024 --> 27:39.726
hoping we'll lead them
to the ex-wife's house.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.430
We have agents guarding them.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.198
Yeah, I'll
call up ahead.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.700
Hey, it's David Sinclair...

27:47.734 --> 27:48.701
(crash)

27:48.735 --> 27:50.369
(tires screeching)

27:52.004 --> 27:52.939
Are you serious?

27:57.476 --> 27:58.745
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:01.113 --> 28:02.214
No, no, no, no, no.

28:03.049 --> 28:03.682
Hey! Hey!

28:09.021 --> 28:09.455
Hold on!

28:09.488 --> 28:10.923
(yells)

28:16.362 --> 28:18.030
(tires screeching, crash)

28:19.531 --> 28:20.733
They're trying to kill us.

28:20.767 --> 28:21.868
You okay?
Yeah, go, go, go.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.135
It's not working! Let's go!

28:23.169 --> 28:25.171
We got to get out of here!
-They got a gun!

28:25.204 --> 28:26.505
Go, go, go, go!
They got a gun!

28:26.538 --> 28:28.307
Get down! Stay down!
-My phone!

28:29.976 --> 28:30.409
(yells)

28:31.844 --> 28:33.412
We got to do
something,

28:33.445 --> 28:35.381
'cause the Congressman's about
to call a press conference,

28:35.414 --> 28:36.849
and the Governor's
office is saying

28:36.883 --> 28:38.184
turn up something
concrete

28:38.217 --> 28:40.186
or else hand over
FuГ±es for execution.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.988
All right, just give me
a minute, would you?

28:42.021 --> 28:43.489
Look, I mean, I'm out of time.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.892
It's so odd-- he wants
his daughter back,

28:45.925 --> 28:47.794
he seems to cooperate,
he's not trying to escape.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.328
DON: Screw it. You know, I'm
sick of

28:49.361 --> 28:51.430
trying to get
in this freak's head anyway.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.767
Psychology is a step or two
behind neuroscience these days.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.135
Meaning?

28:56.168 --> 28:57.469
fMRI.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.939
Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.073
Yeah, it's a brain scan.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.975
LARRY: Deception requires more
energy--

29:03.009 --> 29:05.812
i.e. more blood to the brain--
than truth telling,

29:05.845 --> 29:07.413
which is a simpler task.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.781
You can tell if he's lying?

29:08.815 --> 29:10.116
CHARLIE:
The fMRI can detect

29:10.149 --> 29:11.183
even partial truths.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.418
Well, can we get one?

29:12.451 --> 29:14.086
Oh, that could be challenging.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.487
The magnet weighs over two tons.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.789
I'm not sure

29:16.823 --> 29:17.857
your elevators
could handle that.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.291
One at Cal Sci's
kept in the basement.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.793
(knock at door)

29:20.827 --> 29:22.028
I need to talk to you.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.295
All right.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.530
Set it up.

29:30.870 --> 29:31.871
DAVID:
Run!

29:31.904 --> 29:32.905
Move!

29:32.939 --> 29:33.873
This way! Go!

29:33.906 --> 29:34.440
Go!

29:37.977 --> 29:39.946
Hey, all due respect, sir,

29:39.979 --> 29:42.214
you are making this more
volatile than it has to be.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.183
My wife is tortured
night and day

29:44.216 --> 29:45.484
with thoughts of
my son's death.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.418
I understand.
I will do anything

29:46.452 --> 29:48.454
to give her peace.
I don't care if I make

29:48.487 --> 29:49.989
a fool of myself,
I don't care if I make

29:50.022 --> 29:51.123
the situation more volatile.
-Sir, this is

29:51.157 --> 29:53.259
our last chance to find out what
happened to your son!

29:53.292 --> 29:56.829
Now, I can only move this
prisoner with FBI personnel.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.965
If you insist on coming,
I'm gonna have to call it off!

29:58.998 --> 30:00.166
Now, I will call you

30:00.199 --> 30:01.467
as soon as I know anything,

30:01.500 --> 30:02.568
all right?

30:02.601 --> 30:05.104
You'll have to excuse me
for one second.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.272
Hey.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.840
We're ready to
transport FuГ±es.

30:07.874 --> 30:08.774
You know where
David is?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.509
He's with Brickle,
talking to the ex-wife.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.412
Get down!

30:14.947 --> 30:16.315
You have your cell phone on you?

30:16.348 --> 30:17.850
It's in my briefcase.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.251
It's not here,
it's back in my briefcase.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.420
You've been shot in the
arm; you're bleeding.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.554
(groans)

30:22.588 --> 30:23.555
That feel
any better?

30:23.589 --> 30:25.391
Yeah, it's fine.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.159
You know how to use a gun?

30:27.193 --> 30:29.061
Point and click?

30:29.095 --> 30:30.529
More or less.
You don't waste any shots.

30:30.562 --> 30:31.964
We don't have
a lot of ammo, okay?

30:33.599 --> 30:34.566
Take it.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.601
This thing have a safety?

30:35.634 --> 30:37.303
No.
Great.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.106
All right, come on, move.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.407
That way. Go, go!

30:41.440 --> 30:42.909
Quiet.

30:42.942 --> 30:43.910
Stay down.

30:43.943 --> 30:44.977
BRICKLE:
These guys are crazy.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.578
They're coming
after us now?

30:46.612 --> 30:49.115
I've got all of
Berelli's RICO files.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.017
He kills me, his case gets
postponed -Shh!

30:51.050 --> 30:52.985
for months while another
AUSA gets up to speed.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.221
Meanwhile, his
lawyers get him out,

30:55.254 --> 30:58.057
and he skips
the country.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.159
So if I give you up,
I can go home?

31:02.228 --> 31:03.629
Just kidding. Let's go.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.033
Come on.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.671
This all seems familiar.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.007
Larry, you've only been
gone four and a half months.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.075
Larry?

31:17.176 --> 31:19.111
Hi!

31:19.145 --> 31:20.546
He's lost some bone strength.
-Hi.

31:20.579 --> 31:21.547
Just six percent.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.349
Oh.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.984
It's...

31:25.017 --> 31:25.751
(chuckles)

31:25.784 --> 31:27.553
It's so wonderful
to see you.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.488
Thank you.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.524
I set up the fMRI with Quartz.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.027
Cool.
Oh, I...

31:35.061 --> 31:36.996
Good thing it's a
Saturday, or we couldn't

31:37.029 --> 31:38.030
pull this
caper off, huh?

31:38.064 --> 31:39.131
Hey, uh, just...

31:39.165 --> 31:40.399
I cleared the whole building--
faculty, students--

31:40.432 --> 31:42.034
for two hours,
all right?

31:42.068 --> 31:42.969
That should give
us enough time

31:43.002 --> 31:44.937
to explore this
convicted felon's neurons

31:44.971 --> 31:46.072
and get him out, no?

31:46.105 --> 31:47.073
Mm-hmm. -Yeah. -Great.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.374
Listen, would you mind if we...
-Go this way...

31:48.407 --> 31:50.076
Larry? Larry's here?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.377
Larry!

31:51.410 --> 31:53.045
Welcome back.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.046
Millie.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.114
Oh, so good to see you.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.082
Oh!

31:56.115 --> 31:57.016
Bones!
Bones!

31:57.049 --> 31:57.950
Bones?

31:57.984 --> 31:59.986
Just some demineralization
of the skeleton,

32:00.019 --> 32:01.020
due to microgravity.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.088
Aw...

32:02.121 --> 32:03.589
How are you, Mildred?
-I'm good.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.024
And look at you; you look great.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.192
We are so proud of you.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.961
We are going to throw you
the party of your life, Mister.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.097
Actually, I think I'd prefer
everyone just kind of

32:11.130 --> 32:13.332
pretend I'm not here, which
is not altogether untrue.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.433
MILLIE:
No, no, no, no, no.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.335
It's on us. We're
so proud of you.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.270
(whispers):
Down, down.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.371
Quiet.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.406
(loud clank)

32:20.439 --> 32:22.108
DAVID (whispers):
Hey, be quiet!

32:22.141 --> 32:24.143
(screaming)
Move!

32:24.176 --> 32:25.744
Down, down!

32:25.777 --> 32:26.979
No, this way!

32:27.013 --> 32:27.746
Go!

32:27.779 --> 32:29.115
Down!

32:35.054 --> 32:37.056
Stay calm, Brickle,
all right?

32:37.089 --> 32:38.524
I will get you out of here.
-All right.

32:38.557 --> 32:39.591
Are you ready?

32:39.625 --> 32:40.592
Ready for what?

32:40.626 --> 32:41.760
Wh-What's the plan?

32:41.793 --> 32:44.463
Gonna run and shoot.

32:44.496 --> 32:47.133
That's all
you have to do.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.434
All right, let's go.
-Wait.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.002
Hold on a second.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.071
What?

32:52.104 --> 32:53.205
All right, let's go.
-Go!

33:00.179 --> 33:03.215
David's still not
answering up on his radio.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.716
30 minutes.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.285
Find him.

33:07.553 --> 33:08.387
Ready.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.688
Look, Pony,

33:09.721 --> 33:12.724
I want you to describe
to me where you were.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.394
On a hill off

33:15.427 --> 33:17.563
Highway 126, near Castaic.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.098
(beep)

33:19.131 --> 33:20.232
Truthful.

33:20.266 --> 33:20.999
Hmm.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.270
PONY:
Walking down the hill.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.272
Could see the moon out.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.273
It looked pretty good.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.407
(trilling)

33:28.440 --> 33:29.741
Truthful.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.578
What day did the boy go missing?

33:32.611 --> 33:33.812
January 13, uh,

33:33.845 --> 33:34.446
'97.

33:36.748 --> 33:37.749
DON:
Then what happened?

33:37.783 --> 33:42.554
I talked to the boy
about the Man in the Moon.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.555
(trilling)

33:43.589 --> 33:44.590
When he looked up,

33:44.623 --> 33:46.425
I broke his neck.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.660
(beeps)
Truthful.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.162
PONY:
But, you know, he never felt it.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.830
Never felt a thing. He...

33:51.863 --> 33:53.332
He-he wasn't scared.

33:53.365 --> 33:58.070
January 13, 1997...

33:58.104 --> 33:59.205
was a new moon,

33:59.238 --> 34:00.639
meaning there
was no moon.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.841
Rain all throughout
L.A. County.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.477
His brain activity shows
no signs of deception.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.213
That's only possible if

34:07.246 --> 34:09.081
there's some sort of...
-Confabulation.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.482
He's constructed
a memory

34:10.516 --> 34:12.184
that he believes is real.

34:12.218 --> 34:13.585
He's fooling the
machines because

34:13.619 --> 34:14.653
he's fooling himself.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.290
May I?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.759
Yeah. Just, uh,
hit this button.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.861
Mr. FuГ±es,

34:22.894 --> 34:25.264
it was raining the night
Randy Amato was killed.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.335
And there was no moon.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.336
PONY:
What-what...?

34:30.369 --> 34:31.537
What are you saying?

34:31.570 --> 34:33.605
(trilling)

34:33.639 --> 34:36.375
(beeping)

34:36.408 --> 34:37.376
(grunts)

34:37.409 --> 34:39.178
(gunfire)

34:41.313 --> 34:41.880
(gunshot)

34:41.913 --> 34:43.682
(gunshots)

34:44.716 --> 34:45.251
(gunshot)

34:45.284 --> 34:47.085
(grunts)

34:48.154 --> 34:51.823
(gunshots)

34:51.857 --> 34:52.891
I'm out. Point

34:52.924 --> 34:55.327
and shoot! Point
and shoot!

34:55.361 --> 34:59.431
(gunshots and groaning)

35:13.212 --> 35:14.045
Hey, get up.
Listen!

35:14.079 --> 35:15.781
I need to get you
out of here. Let's go.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.183
We have to get to a phone.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.784
There's no phone,
there's no help.

35:18.817 --> 35:19.785
We need another plan.

35:19.818 --> 35:23.389
(panting)

35:23.422 --> 35:24.890
It wasn't raining. How-how...

35:24.923 --> 35:25.757
How can that be?

35:25.791 --> 35:27.826
Only one body was found
on that hill.

35:27.859 --> 35:28.860
Yeah.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.197
Lorenzo Marcellus was killed
in the summer of '94.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.532
And on a dry, moonlit
night, no doubt.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.302
He's constructing his memory
based on partial truths.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.674
Pony, did you kill
Lorenzo Marcellus on that hill?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.543
No.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.777
(beep)

35:45.811 --> 35:46.778
That was Berelli.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.214
Me and Berelli
set up Marcellus.

35:48.247 --> 35:52.218
Berelli had Marcellus thinking
they were there to kill me.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.953
Berelli said, uh,
"Look up at the moon."

35:54.986 --> 35:57.656
I looked up,
Marcellus looked up.

35:57.689 --> 35:58.790
Then Berelli shot him.

35:58.824 --> 35:59.791
Never saw it coming.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.495
(beeping)

36:04.596 --> 36:06.332
Where's the boy, Pony?

36:08.367 --> 36:10.236
DON: It was raining. There was
no moon.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.337
Uh...

36:12.771 --> 36:13.772
Look, no.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.574
Hey, uh, I got
to get out of here.

36:15.607 --> 36:16.808
You got to get me out
of this thing. I gotta...

36:16.842 --> 36:18.710
Calm down! -No! I got to get out
of this thing.

36:18.744 --> 36:19.645
Right now, I don't like... You
gotta get me...

36:19.678 --> 36:21.380
He's moving his head. We
have to release him.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.749
I'm gonna break this, break this
damn thing!

36:23.782 --> 36:24.750
Get me out of here!

36:24.783 --> 36:26.318
Let me out...
All right, all right, all right.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.653
Relax!

36:27.686 --> 36:29.321
I'm going to break it.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.523
Just calm down. You remember
what happened, don't you?

36:31.557 --> 36:32.691
(gasps)
Huh?

36:32.724 --> 36:33.859
(panting)

36:33.892 --> 36:34.993
The kid was so scared.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.829
That kid was so scared,
he was freaking out, and, uh...

36:37.863 --> 36:39.998
I mean, he peed his pants,
and I couldn't do it, man.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.334
I could not kill that kid, I
couldn't do it. -Uh-huh.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.769
Berelli laughed at me,
and he shot him.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.471
Where's the body?

36:45.504 --> 36:47.739
I don't know. I don't know
where the body...

36:47.773 --> 36:48.674
I don't know.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.975
Yeah, you do, Pony.
Where's that body?!

36:51.877 --> 36:54.946
It was muddy.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.648
Mud was everywhere.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.684
It-it was raining.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.757
Berelli... shot the kid...

37:07.526 --> 37:09.528
...and stuck him
in a drainpipe.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.430
He stuck him
in a drainpipe.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.841
BRICKLE:
Okay, wait just...

37:22.874 --> 37:24.776
No, you can't keep
going. Just stop,

37:24.810 --> 37:25.944
okay?

37:25.977 --> 37:27.813
You're hurt. You're
losing too much blood.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.581
Stay still. Just stop
moving for a second.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.552
I got to stop
the bleeding.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.956
Make a run for it.
Find a phone.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.825
I'm going to get help.

37:39.858 --> 37:40.792
I'm going to
come back, okay?

37:40.826 --> 37:42.027
And you're going
to be fine.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.830
Toss it!
Toss it!

37:44.863 --> 37:45.931
It's in your best interest.

37:45.964 --> 37:49.835
You don't know how much
I want to shoot you right now.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.002
Put it on the ground!

37:53.572 --> 37:54.840
I was running out
of things to say.

37:54.873 --> 37:55.874
Grab his weapon.

37:55.907 --> 37:58.644
Go on.
All right.

37:58.677 --> 37:59.077
Hands on your head.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.546
Right now.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.713
(laughs)

38:03.749 --> 38:05.984
No one will ever,

38:06.017 --> 38:08.454
ever believe this.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.821
(laughing)

38:10.956 --> 38:13.425
(laughs)

38:13.459 --> 38:14.860
(panting)

38:20.131 --> 38:21.633
Hi.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.034
I'm Don Eppes with the FBI.

38:23.068 --> 38:25.437
Did they move him
to San Quentin?

38:25.471 --> 38:27.739
Uh, in a few hours.

38:27.773 --> 38:29.808
Mom, please let
me see him.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.044
Listen, I, um...

38:33.078 --> 38:34.946
I thought you
should know that

38:34.980 --> 38:37.749
he did something today
for someone else,

38:37.783 --> 38:39.785
and, you know,
despite who he is

38:39.818 --> 38:42.521
and what he's done,
it was really a decent thing.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.491
And he-he did it
for your daughter.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.034
DAVID:
Hey, Granger, man,

38:56.067 --> 38:58.837
next time I don't answer
my phone, do me a favor.

38:58.870 --> 38:59.705
Just call the cavalry.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.773
Yeah? What if
you're having sex, huh?

39:01.807 --> 39:04.576
Yeah, point taken.
-Yeah.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.945
Brickle, so, you're kind of
the hero, huh? How's that feel?

39:06.978 --> 39:08.880
Phew! I'm never leaving
my office again.

39:08.914 --> 39:09.948
That's for sure.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.016
(laughter)
Unless you're with me.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.760
* Gravity

39:21.793 --> 39:22.794
I go in there?

39:22.828 --> 39:23.862
You have about a half an hour.

39:24.996 --> 39:25.964
You all right?

39:25.997 --> 39:26.865
Mm-hmm.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.536
DON:
All right.

39:31.803 --> 39:35.140
* And gravity

39:35.173 --> 39:36.808
Hi.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.143
Hi.

39:42.948 --> 39:46.084
* Oh, I'll never know

39:46.117 --> 39:49.087
* What makes this man

39:49.120 --> 39:51.757
* With all the love

39:51.790 --> 39:52.758
LUCY:
Um...

39:52.791 --> 39:54.560
I'm Lucy.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.062
Pony.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.866
Pretty.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.834
Thank you.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.974
* Whoa, whoa, gravity

40:09.007 --> 40:10.976
Sorry.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.779
It's o... It's okay.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.552
* And gravity

40:22.621 --> 40:25.757
* Wants to bring me down

40:25.791 --> 40:28.159
(exhales loudly)

40:28.193 --> 40:32.030
* Oh, twice as much

40:32.063 --> 40:35.767
* Ain't twice as good

40:35.801 --> 40:38.470
* And can't sustain

40:38.504 --> 40:41.039
* Like one half could

40:41.072 --> 40:44.042
* It's wanting more

40:44.075 --> 40:48.480
* That's gonna
send me to my knees... *

40:50.582 --> 40:53.151
ALAN: So, why did FuГ±es confess
to killing the boy

40:53.184 --> 40:54.285
when he didn't do it?

40:54.319 --> 40:56.888
He couldn't tolerate the thought
of what really happened,

40:56.922 --> 40:58.557
so he created
a false memory.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.026
But wasn't
that false memory worse?

41:01.059 --> 41:03.094
LARRY: Well, but not for the
boy.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.996
You know, Pony comforted himself

41:05.030 --> 41:06.632
with the delusion that

41:06.665 --> 41:08.233
he was providing the child
a better death.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.035
Now, granted, that
better death

41:10.068 --> 41:12.904
took place all
in his own mind, but...

41:12.938 --> 41:15.106
* Than his heart can stand

41:15.140 --> 41:16.107
ALAN:
Hey, Larry,

41:16.141 --> 41:17.175
it's good to see you back.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.910
Oh, thank you.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.612
No, I'm delighted
to see you both,

41:20.646 --> 41:22.814
truly I am,
more than I can say,

41:22.848 --> 41:24.215
and I thank you

41:24.249 --> 41:27.185
for indulging my apprehension
of walls and ceilings by

41:27.218 --> 41:28.687
dining al fresco
like this.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.889
Well, you're going to have
to get over that, Larry.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.023
You have to
find a place

41:32.057 --> 41:33.291
to sleep, don't you?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.160
Well, you know,
I was rather hoping

41:35.193 --> 41:37.095
for a spot over near
the koi pond tonight.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.530
(laughs)

41:39.665 --> 41:41.032
I think I have a better idea.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.570
Oh, Charles,
I'm moved.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.772
Yeah, you know, get
you a reading light.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.173
Maybe a little
computer table.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.240
How about that?

41:49.274 --> 41:51.710
Well, you know, I should
mention, starting tomorrow,

41:51.743 --> 41:53.211
I do have a place to stay.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.680
Really? Where?

41:54.713 --> 41:57.549
Well, I have secured
a small

41:57.583 --> 41:59.785
but rather
spiritually spacious cell

41:59.818 --> 42:01.920
at a monastery in Altadena.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.789
You're becoming
a monk?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.857
No, no, nothing
so dramatic as that.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.859
No. The monastery
allows the public

42:07.893 --> 42:09.194
to go on retreats there,

42:09.227 --> 42:11.329
and I just thought
I needed some time to...

42:11.362 --> 42:12.764
Transition for reentry.

42:12.798 --> 42:14.600
That's it. Well,
you know something, Charles?

42:14.633 --> 42:19.070
All my life, I have looked
to the cosmological for meaning,

42:19.104 --> 42:21.640
and that outward
focus-- it's given

42:21.673 --> 42:25.977
me quite a ride, but I just...
now, I-I feel the need to...

42:26.011 --> 42:28.880
explore the universe
of a single mind.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.849
My own.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.987
Well, Altadena's only,
what, a...

42:36.021 --> 42:38.356
a ten-minute drive from Cal Sci.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.626
Well, or a 20-minute walk.

42:40.659 --> 42:43.161
Of course,
no cars.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.796
No 1931 Ford Roadster,

42:44.830 --> 42:47.332
but I would like
to know what it's like

42:47.365 --> 42:49.668
to live without obsessions.

42:49.701 --> 42:50.936
White food?

42:50.969 --> 42:53.905
Oh, that would
be difficult.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.774
But, yes.

42:55.807 --> 42:59.010
You know, I might
well include greens.

42:59.044 --> 43:01.346
* Just keep me
where the light is... *

43:01.379 --> 43:04.282
* Ooh... *

43:04.315 --> 43:08.086
* Come on, keep me
where the light is *

43:08.119 --> 43:09.788
* Ooh... *

43:09.821 --> 43:11.757
* Come on, keep me where...
