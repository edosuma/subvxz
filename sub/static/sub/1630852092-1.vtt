WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:04.370
Every day I question
whether or not

00:04.472 --> 00:06.238
I should keep going like this.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.107
-What's the matter?
-[crying] I'm hurting!

00:12.780 --> 00:15.614
Something in my head is telling
me I have to eat the food.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.849
I just can't stop.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.451
My whole life
revolves around food.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.688
Make sure you put butter
in the bacon.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.890
[man] When I eat,
I never wanna stop.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.992
[woman] He eats in his sleep.

00:28.295 --> 00:32.498
I think other people take for
granted the ability to just move

00:32.600 --> 00:34.266
and not be in pain
all the time.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.869
I have severe anxiety.

00:36.971 --> 00:39.038
I have stabbing pain
in my feet.

00:39.140 --> 00:42.341
The lymphedema growth, it's got
open sores that leak body fluid.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.944
-I have depression issues.
-Diabetes. High cholesterol.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.347
-High blood pressure.
-Ouch! [Bleep].

00:48.449 --> 00:50.382
My body is crushing itself.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.584
-[woman distantly] Are you okay?
-No.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.920
That's what living like this
has done for me.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.327
If you keep this up,
I guarantee you neither of you

01:02.430 --> 01:04.763
will be here
five years from now.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.231
My food addiction
is killing me,

01:06.333 --> 01:07.833
and I know
it's now or never.

01:07.935 --> 01:11.770
Can you imagine being a...
Arabian horse --

01:11.872 --> 01:13.605
strong,
ready to run --

01:13.707 --> 01:16.041
but you stuck in the body
of a elephant.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.444
You are not ready
to lose weight!

01:18.546 --> 01:20.946
Prove them wrong.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.615
I'm so close to quitting,
it's ridiculous.

01:23.717 --> 01:24.716
Ooh.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.385
-I tell my dad, "We got this...
-Eight. Nine.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.519
...I'm behind you
no matter what."

01:29.356 --> 01:31.757
Honestly, our intimacy
has changed.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.493
If something doesn't change,
I will either be a widow

01:34.595 --> 01:35.894
or I'll be divorced.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.162
Oh, [bleep].

01:37.264 --> 01:39.331
-[sobbing]
-Well, I'm sorry.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.467
I'm scared it's already
too late for me.

01:41.569 --> 01:45.370
The situation could still become
critical at any moment.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.940
Every time I go to bed,
I wonder if this is the time

01:48.042 --> 01:48.907
I don't wake up.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.542
[sobbing]

01:50.644 --> 01:53.679
I'm trying to tell y'all
I need help. I want it.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.282
If I don't change,
I'm gonna die.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.691
[Nathan]<i> I'm at a point now</i>
<i> where it's painful</i>
<i> to do anything</i>

02:05.793 --> 02:07.092
<i> and it gets worse everyday</i>

02:07.194 --> 02:09.761
<i> because now I have</i>
<i> this large sore</i>
<i> on the back of my leg.</i>

02:16.303 --> 02:19.538
[woman 1]<i> Somewhere in me</i>
<i> is this little</i>
<i> glimmer of hope.</i>

02:19.640 --> 02:21.874
<i> I just want to be</i>
<i> a normal person.</i>

02:32.953 --> 02:36.021
You can't do it
and then I just get mad.

02:36.123 --> 02:39.391
[woman 2]<i> If I don't make</i>
<i> a change now, I'm scared</i>
<i> it's going to be too late.</i>

02:43.697 --> 02:46.698
-[groaning] It hurts.
-Stand up, you're all right.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.767
[woman 3]<i> I refuse</i>
<i> to stop fighting.</i>

02:48.869 --> 02:50.702
<i> I have to do this</i>
<i> for my children.</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:58.310
Does she respect you?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.745
[Amber] No. Probably not.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.581
I just want her
to be proud of me.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.607
[sighs]

03:29.743 --> 03:31.577
[Nathan]<i> The mornings are</i>
<i> the worst part of my day.</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:34.813
<i> And I hate waking up</i>

03:34.915 --> 03:38.016
<i> because of how hard</i>
<i> and painful it is</i>
<i> being in this body now.</i>

03:41.889 --> 03:44.156
<i> I can't really lay down</i>
<i> anymore, you know.</i>

03:44.258 --> 03:48.026
<i> I can't breathe if I do</i>
<i> because my weight pushes</i>
<i> the air out of my body.</i>

03:50.631 --> 03:52.965
<i> So, I started sleeping</i>
<i> in my chair, but I hate that</i>

03:53.067 --> 03:55.934
<i> because it means</i>
<i> that I can't sleep</i>
<i> by my wife Amber anymore.</i>

03:57.071 --> 03:59.638
<i> She's usually gone</i>
<i> by the time I get up.</i>

03:59.740 --> 04:01.607
<i> She's a school teacher</i>
<i> and so am I.</i>

04:01.709 --> 04:05.277
<i>I teach theater, but I've been</i>
<i> on medical leave</i>
<i> for a while now,</i>

04:05.379 --> 04:08.413
<i> because of how hard it is</i>
<i> for me to get around</i>
<i> at the size I'm at.</i>

04:10.384 --> 04:13.619
<i> I'm at a point now</i>
<i> where it's painful</i>
<i> to do anything</i>

04:13.721 --> 04:18.991
I think other people
take for granted the ability
to just move, you know.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.861
<i> And not be in pain</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

04:22.963 --> 04:24.896
Like, I'm constantly
in pain even sitting.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.204
Go use the restroom.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.339
<i> But the dogs,</i>
<i> if I don't let them out,</i>

04:34.441 --> 04:37.042
<i> then they'll have accidents</i>
<i> around the house.</i>

04:37.144 --> 04:38.744
<i> I won't be able</i>
<i> to clean it up.</i>

04:39.813 --> 04:42.581
<i> So I push myself to let them</i>
<i> do what they need.</i>

04:44.318 --> 04:45.450
Come on, house. Let's go.

04:46.954 --> 04:51.156
<i> But after that, I have to get</i>
<i> to where I can rest</i>
<i> as soon as possible.</i>

04:51.258 --> 04:52.991
<i> And I already want</i>
<i> to go back to bed.</i>

04:53.961 --> 04:55.761
<i> But in the morning,</i>
<i> I have to get clean.</i>

04:56.697 --> 04:57.696
[shower running]

04:59.166 --> 05:02.167
<i> Because the growth</i>
<i> that's in between my legs,</i>

05:02.269 --> 05:03.535
<i> the lymphedema growth,</i>

05:03.637 --> 05:07.005
it's got open sores
that actually leak body fluid.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.776
<i> And not taking care of that</i>
<i> could lead to infections,</i>

05:10.878 --> 05:14.346
<i> and infection means</i>
<i> I could wind up</i>
<i> in the hospital.</i>

05:14.448 --> 05:17.282
<i> So as much as I hate it</i>
<i> because of how hard it is,</i>

05:17.384 --> 05:19.918
<i>I make myself shower everyday.</i>

05:20.020 --> 05:22.454
<i> It's just hard to do</i>
<i> because of my size.</i>

05:22.556 --> 05:25.057
<i> And sometimes I don't get</i>
<i> as clean as I want to.</i>

05:25.159 --> 05:26.525
<i> Sometimes my wife</i>
<i> has to help me,</i>

05:26.627 --> 05:29.561
<i> but when she's gone,</i>
<i> I try to do it on my own.</i>

05:31.198 --> 05:34.566
Some of the things that I do
Nathan specifically asked

05:34.668 --> 05:35.600
that it not be mentioned

05:35.703 --> 05:36.735
<i> because I do things</i>

05:36.837 --> 05:38.503
<i> that not even a wife</i>
<i> should have to do.</i>

05:40.307 --> 05:42.974
[Nathan]<i> It just shows</i>
<i> how bad off my body is.</i>

05:44.578 --> 05:48.980
<i> That's not something</i>
<i> that a healthy person</i>
<i> should experience.</i>

05:49.083 --> 05:50.982
Knee pains and back pains
and open sores.

05:51.085 --> 05:51.983
I shouldn't have all that.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.153
<i> And it gets worse every day,</i>

05:55.255 --> 05:57.255
mainly because of the sore
on my leg.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.059
<i> It's itchy</i>
<i> and it's filled with puss.</i>

06:01.929 --> 06:04.229
<i> So I have to keep</i>
<i> the wound dry</i>

06:04.331 --> 06:07.032
<i> so it doesn't get infected</i>
<i> and get even worse.</i>

06:08.736 --> 06:12.037
Dad's going to go fix him
some food. He's hungry.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.743
<i> And finally, now that</i>
<i>I'm clean and dressed and dry,</i>

06:17.845 --> 06:19.111
<i> it's time for breakfast.</i>

06:26.120 --> 06:29.221
<i> There isn't a moment</i>
<i> when I'm not craving</i>
<i> something to eat.</i>

06:31.425 --> 06:33.859
<i> No matter what I'm facing,</i>
<i> food will make it better.</i>

06:34.895 --> 06:36.661
<i> Food is my relief</i>
<i> and my comfort,</i>

06:36.764 --> 06:39.431
<i> and it's what</i>
<i> I constantly want.</i>

06:39.533 --> 06:41.433
Food is the only thing
in the world
that doesn't talk back

06:41.535 --> 06:43.635
unless it gives you
acid reflux.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.737
<i> It's just going to</i>
<i> make you feel better.</i>

06:48.409 --> 06:51.610
<i> And when I'm eating,</i>
<i> it's euphoric.</i>

06:51.712 --> 06:54.713
<i> It's like this feeling</i>
<i> of relief from whatever</i>
<i> negative emotion</i>

06:54.815 --> 06:56.648
<i> I have going on at that time.</i>

06:58.752 --> 07:01.887
<i> And so, even though</i>
<i> a meal like this</i>
<i> will make me really full,</i>

07:01.989 --> 07:03.622
<i> I'll keep eating and eating.</i>

07:05.893 --> 07:07.726
<i> Because that craving</i>
<i> never goes away,</i>

07:08.562 --> 07:10.162
<i> and it's always</i>
<i> been there for me.</i>

07:19.006 --> 07:21.306
<i> Eating has always been</i>
<i> a big part of my life,</i>

07:21.408 --> 07:22.908
<i> starting when I was</i>
<i> really young.</i>

07:24.778 --> 07:27.779
<i> I think part of that</i>
<i> is because my dad worked</i>
<i> for a food company.</i>

07:29.249 --> 07:32.150
<i> So we constantly</i>
<i> had junk food around us.</i>

07:32.252 --> 07:34.319
<i> You know, I'm the youngest</i>
<i> of three siblings.</i>

07:34.421 --> 07:37.088
<i> I have an older sister</i>
<i> and an older brother,</i>

07:37.191 --> 07:40.091
<i> and all of us,</i>
<i> including our parents,</i>
<i> just ate all day long.</i>

07:40.194 --> 07:43.094
<i> Food, it was almost like</i>
<i> a headache pill</i>
<i> would be for a headache</i>

07:43.197 --> 07:44.496
<i> because it made me happy.</i>

07:45.966 --> 07:47.332
<i> But the downside of that</i>

07:47.434 --> 07:49.668
<i> obviously that led to me</i>
<i> putting on weight.</i>

07:50.637 --> 07:52.037
<i> I didn't realize it at first,</i>

07:52.139 --> 07:54.206
<i> but in junior high,</i>
<i> when I was 13,</i>

07:54.308 --> 07:56.708
<i> that's when the bullying</i>
<i> really started</i>
<i> because of my weight.</i>

07:56.810 --> 07:59.878
<i> Because I got up to</i>
<i> over 250 pounds by then.</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:02.380
<i> I was probably already</i>
<i> in like a 1X, 2X.</i>

08:02.483 --> 08:04.916
And I can remember
I tried out for basketball

08:05.018 --> 08:06.751
because I liked
watching basketball.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.254
And I thought,
maybe I would be good at it.

08:09.356 --> 08:13.225
<i> They made us try out</i>
<i> in front of the whole school</i>
<i> in the morning</i>

08:13.327 --> 08:15.594
<i> because what they did</i>
<i> was they had the students</i>

08:15.696 --> 08:17.128
<i> assemble in the gym</i>

08:17.231 --> 08:18.930
<i> before they went</i>
<i> to their first period.</i>

08:19.032 --> 08:20.398
<i> And people were laughing</i>
<i> and pointing,</i>

08:20.501 --> 08:22.367
<i> and the coach</i>
<i> had to stop tryouts.</i>

08:22.469 --> 08:26.471
And he yelled at them,
saying, "At least he's down
here trying." You know.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.242
<i> Being 15 and around 350,</i>

08:30.344 --> 08:31.910
<i> I didn't really</i>
<i> try to make friends.</i>

08:32.012 --> 08:35.814
<i> I kept to myself</i>
<i> and after school,</i>
<i> I'd just go home and eat.</i>

08:35.916 --> 08:38.617
<i> When you get upset,</i>
<i> you reach for that ice cream,</i>
<i> you know.</i>

08:38.719 --> 08:41.786
And I can finish ice cream
like nobody's business.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.288
<i> But things did get</i>
<i> a little better</i>

08:43.390 --> 08:44.422
<i>toward the end of high school.</i>

08:45.726 --> 08:48.126
<i> That's when I fell in love</i>
<i> with theater.</i>

08:48.228 --> 08:49.761
<i> It was theater</i>
<i> that made me feel like</i>

08:49.863 --> 08:51.496
<i>I could be who I wanted to be.</i>

08:52.399 --> 08:54.165
I still to this day think

08:54.268 --> 08:56.902
that my theater teacher
in the high school level

08:57.004 --> 09:00.739
was probably one of the ones
that helped get me through.

09:00.841 --> 09:05.143
<i> It was around the same time</i>
<i> that I found out my mom</i>
<i> was diagnosed with cancer.</i>

09:05.245 --> 09:07.779
And ironically at that time,
I was playing a cancer patient

09:07.881 --> 09:11.316
while my mom was going through
the cancer treatment.

09:11.418 --> 09:15.754
So, it allowed me to really
deal with it in a safe place.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.456
<i> I chose a college</i>
<i> based on theater.</i>

09:18.559 --> 09:20.859
<i> But I was still eating a lot</i>
<i> and gaining.</i>

09:20.961 --> 09:24.696
<i> And by the time I graduated,</i>
<i> I was around 450 pounds.</i>

09:24.798 --> 09:26.431
<i> But immediately</i>
<i> after I graduated,</i>

09:26.533 --> 09:28.600
<i> I got a job at a high school</i>
<i> in Longview,</i>

09:28.702 --> 09:30.535
<i> and that's where</i>
<i> I met my wife, Amber.</i>

09:39.913 --> 09:42.380
Come on, guys. Get back.
Get back, get back.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.249
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.385
-Thank you
for picking up the food.
-Welcome.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.486
[Nathan] So how was your day?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.157
[Amber] It was crazy.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.225
-[Nathan] Oh, really?
-Yeah.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.994
[Amber]<i> From the first time</i>
<i> I saw Nathan,</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:57.529
<i> I could see</i>
<i> what made him special.</i>

09:57.631 --> 09:58.863
<i> He's a great person.</i>

09:58.966 --> 10:01.499
<i> He is an amazing</i>
<i> theater director,</i>

10:01.602 --> 10:03.335
<i> he is an amazing teacher.</i>

10:03.437 --> 10:05.570
<i> And having similar</i>
<i> backgrounds with food</i>

10:05.672 --> 10:08.373
<i> was something I saw</i>
<i> as a positive back then.</i>

10:08.475 --> 10:12.310
And that was one of the things
that I was attracted to

10:12.412 --> 10:13.211
was the idea that

10:13.313 --> 10:15.380
<i>he would be a partner for me</i>

10:15.482 --> 10:18.717
<i> to keep focusing</i>
<i> on my journey with.</i>

10:18.819 --> 10:20.518
-You want a cheese stick?
-No, thank you.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.355
[Amber]<i> But shortly after</i>
<i> we got married,</i>

10:23.457 --> 10:24.823
<i> Nathan went to a doctor</i>

10:24.925 --> 10:26.424
<i> to try and get</i>
<i> weight loss surgery.</i>

10:27.494 --> 10:31.329
So, I actually
got approval for surgery

10:31.431 --> 10:32.931
because I had lost
enough weight.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.101
<i>And I didn't have the copay</i>

10:36.203 --> 10:38.703
<i> and so, they cancelled</i>
<i> my surgery.</i>

10:38.805 --> 10:40.872
And I guess at that point,
I was like, "Forget it.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.508
I'm... I'm done. I'll just
eat however I want to."

10:46.046 --> 10:48.847
-You want a bite?
Last bite of sweets?
-Sure.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.915
<i> That's when</i>
<i> all of his motivation</i>

10:51.018 --> 10:53.985
went by the wayside
really quickly.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.688
[Nathan]<i> I guess I felt like</i>
<i> I wasn't good enough.</i>

11:04.197 --> 11:05.730
<i> When we'd go to eat,</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:10.301
I physically was getting ill
from watching him eat.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.137
<i>He would eat his food.</i>

11:12.239 --> 11:14.439
He would eat an appetizer.
We would have a dessert.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.876
<i> He would eat my leftovers</i>
<i> and it would make me</i>

11:17.978 --> 11:21.112
<i> just absolutely</i>
<i> just disgusted.</i>

11:21.214 --> 11:22.781
<i> When Nathan decided</i>
<i> he didn't want to try</i>

11:22.883 --> 11:25.150
<i> and lose weight anymore,</i>

11:25.252 --> 11:27.385
<i> I told him I was disgusted</i>
<i> with what he was doing.</i>

11:27.487 --> 11:29.587
<i> And I basically told him</i>
<i> he was an embarrassment.</i>

11:34.828 --> 11:37.095
[Nathan] You remember
we have to get
to the grocery store, right?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.463
Mmmhmm.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.831
[dog barking]

11:39.933 --> 11:41.132
All right,
I know you're tired,

11:41.234 --> 11:44.736
but [sighs] can you really
help me to wrap my leg?

11:44.838 --> 11:46.871
Yeah, I guess I'll do it
before I go take a shower.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.173
[dog barks]

11:52.245 --> 11:53.344
[Nathan]
<i> So now I'm at the point</i>

11:53.447 --> 11:54.913
<i> where I'm 600 pounds,</i>

11:55.015 --> 11:57.182
<i> and I have a huge</i>
<i> lymphedema mass on my legs</i>

11:57.284 --> 12:01.319
<i> that pretty much keeps me</i>
<i> stuck in my chair</i>
<i> all day everyday.</i>

12:01.421 --> 12:02.754
<i> I wanted to be</i>
<i> a good father to our kids</i>

12:02.856 --> 12:05.657
<i>just as much as I wanted to be</i>
<i> a good husband to Amber.</i>

12:05.759 --> 12:08.660
<i> Because when we got married,</i>
<i> she had a son, Mark,</i>

12:08.762 --> 12:10.929
<i> and a daughter, Hannah,</i>
<i> who were ten and six.</i>

12:11.031 --> 12:12.630
<i> And now they are my kids too.</i>

12:14.201 --> 12:15.834
<i> But my weight has become</i>
<i> a really big problem</i>

12:15.936 --> 12:17.802
<i>in my relationship with Amber,</i>

12:18.772 --> 12:20.405
<i> and with our whole family.</i>

12:23.243 --> 12:24.943
[Hannah]<i> I do worry</i>
<i> about my dad's health.</i>

12:25.045 --> 12:27.846
I would like him to feel
more confident in his body

12:27.948 --> 12:30.348
and lose some of the weight
so we can do
more activities together.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.151
<i> I always tell him that, like,</i>
<i> "Don't give up.</i>

12:33.253 --> 12:35.820
<i> We got this. I'm behind you</i>
<i> no matter what."</i>

12:35.922 --> 12:39.557
<i> Sometimes I feel like</i>
<i> he's not going to be okay,</i>

12:39.659 --> 12:41.659
<i> but I really do</i>
<i> believe in him.</i>

12:48.902 --> 12:49.901
[music playing on radio]

12:51.071 --> 12:53.271
[Amber] I'm driving
to the grocery store

12:53.940 --> 12:56.908
because that's what
me and Dad needed to do.

12:57.010 --> 13:01.246
[Nathan]<i> I want to be</i>
<i> off experiencing things</i>
<i> with my family,</i>

13:02.249 --> 13:05.216
<i> but I can't</i>
<i> because of my size.</i>

13:05.318 --> 13:07.886
<i> And now I feel like</i>
<i> grocery shopping</i>
<i> is the only thing</i>

13:07.988 --> 13:09.821
<i> that me and Amber</i>
<i> really have left together</i>

13:09.923 --> 13:12.590
<i> and it's the only thing</i>
<i> we do together</i>
<i> aside from eating.</i>

13:13.527 --> 13:15.927
<i> And if you took</i>
<i> eating and food</i>
<i> out of our relationship,</i>

13:16.029 --> 13:18.129
<i> we wouldn't have anything</i>
<i> left now really.</i>

13:21.368 --> 13:24.235
[Nathan] They have carts.
Thank God.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.337
-[Amber] Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Ow, ow.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.608
For three years,
Nathan's health
has not allowed us

13:30.710 --> 13:34.345
<i> to completely do those things</i>
<i> that we enjoy.</i>

13:35.382 --> 13:38.683
<i> And our relationship</i>
<i> is very strained</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:41.953
because of the amount of care
that I have to give him.

13:42.889 --> 13:46.624
<i> And I miss</i>
<i> being able to have,</i>

13:46.726 --> 13:48.893
<i> I guess,</i>
<i> an intimate relationship.</i>

13:48.995 --> 13:51.262
Not like
a sexual relationship,

13:51.364 --> 13:54.299
because Nathan and I
have never.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.535
-Hey, look.
They have croissants too.
-[Amber] Huh?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.537
-[Nathan] You like croissants,
don't you?
-Uh-huh.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.240
[Amber]
<i> That's not what it's about.</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:04.242
<i> But just like,</i>
<i> being able to spend</i>

14:04.344 --> 14:06.244
<i> quality time with each other</i>

14:06.346 --> 14:09.347
<i>where it doesn't involve care.</i>

14:10.717 --> 14:12.717
<i> That's what I want</i>
<i> that we don't have anymore.</i>

14:14.020 --> 14:17.121
<i> And I'm very scared</i>
<i> I'm going to be</i>
<i> just like Nathan.</i>

14:17.224 --> 14:20.158
I would say within
the next four to five years.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.126
<i> Because it's getting to</i>
<i> where I'm having trouble</i>

14:22.229 --> 14:24.128
<i> doing what I need for myself.</i>

14:24.231 --> 14:26.598
<i> I'm over 400 pounds now.</i>

14:26.700 --> 14:28.900
<i> That's what living like this</i>
<i> has done for me.</i>

14:29.736 --> 14:31.402
-You want some bologna?
-[Amber] No.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.739
<i> I have severe anxiety.</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:38.009
<i> I have depression issues.</i>

14:38.111 --> 14:43.681
And I am always
extremely exhausted.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.783
-[cashier] You all doing
all right this evening?
-[Nathan] Yeah.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.385
[Amber sighs] Yeah, yeah.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.687
We're super tired.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.258
-I'm going to place this
right here for you.
-Awesome. Thank you.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.660
[cashier] You're very welcome.
You be careful out there.
Be safe.

14:55.762 --> 14:59.264
-Can you... You need to open
that since we're slow.
-[cashier] Yeah, okay.

15:01.635 --> 15:04.869
[Amber]<i> And I just feel like</i>
<i> Nathan's just let me down</i>

15:04.971 --> 15:07.338
<i> as a husband altogether.</i>

15:07.440 --> 15:08.840
<i> He has tried his best.</i>

15:08.942 --> 15:11.542
<i> I don't want it</i>
<i> to seem like he hasn't.</i>

15:11.645 --> 15:13.144
<i> But it's getting to be</i>
<i> too much.</i>

15:13.246 --> 15:15.013
<i>And I'm at a point now</i>

15:15.115 --> 15:17.815
where everyday I question
whether or not I should stay.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.153
<i> And I stay because I have</i>
<i> love for Nathan.</i>

15:22.255 --> 15:24.856
<i> But I just can't keep going</i>
<i> like this.</i>

15:24.958 --> 15:26.124
<i> Neither of us can.</i>

15:29.296 --> 15:31.362
[Nathan]<i> I can't do much</i>
<i>of anything on my own anymore.</i>

15:31.464 --> 15:33.131
<i> And I know</i>
<i> that frustrates Amber</i>

15:33.233 --> 15:34.999
<i> and it's a lot for her.</i>

15:35.101 --> 15:37.368
<i> So much so that we had</i>
<i> to move our whole life here</i>

15:37.470 --> 15:39.070
<i> to Palestine, Texas.</i>

15:39.172 --> 15:40.538
<i> Because she needed help</i>

15:40.640 --> 15:42.874
<i> and the only family</i>
<i> that she could go to</i>
<i> were her parents.</i>

15:42.976 --> 15:45.143
<i> So they help out</i>
<i> when it's too much for Amber.</i>

15:46.346 --> 15:48.079
<i> And I hate it because</i>
<i> I feel like I'm a burden</i>

15:48.181 --> 15:49.681
<i> to my whole family</i>
<i> at this point</i>

15:49.783 --> 15:51.149
<i> and I'm ashamed of that.</i>

15:51.251 --> 15:53.151
<i> And if it gets to be</i>
<i> too much for Amber,</i>

15:53.253 --> 15:54.485
<i> I'm scared</i>
<i> she's going to leave me.</i>

16:13.039 --> 16:15.039
[Nathan]<i> My appointment</i>
<i> with Dr. Now is tomorrow.</i>

16:15.141 --> 16:17.008
<i> So today,</i>
<i> I'm headed to Houston.</i>

16:17.110 --> 16:20.345
[Jack] We're here. Hey.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.046
[Nathan]
<i> Amber is working today,</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:24.015
<i> so my in-laws</i>
<i> came over to get me</i>

16:24.117 --> 16:25.350
<i> and help me get there.</i>

16:25.452 --> 16:27.051
[Tracie] Are you ready?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.753
Ready as I'm going to be.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.055
<i> It's only three hours there</i>
<i> and three hours back.</i>

16:31.157 --> 16:33.091
<i> But I told Amber</i>
<i> I wanted to go down</i>

16:33.193 --> 16:34.525
<i>the day before the appointment</i>

16:34.627 --> 16:36.828
<i> so I can rest</i>
<i> before we see Dr. Now.</i>

16:38.298 --> 16:39.597
All right, what's...
What's going?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.032
This is a bag of snacks.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.767
Where's mine?

16:42.869 --> 16:44.702
-It's in there, Jack.
I promise you.
-Okay, okay. I'm just...

16:44.804 --> 16:46.537
Because you know
I don't do jalapeno stuff.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.805
I'm making sure
you got my chips.

16:47.907 --> 16:48.973
-I did.
-You stay right there.

16:51.911 --> 16:52.910
[Jack]<i> Because over the years,</i>

16:53.013 --> 16:54.812
<i> I've seen him get</i>
<i> bigger and bigger.</i>

16:54.914 --> 16:58.149
Before he was able to
move around a lot more.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.151
And do a lot more things.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.954
<i> But now that he's so big,</i>
<i> he's limited.</i>

17:03.056 --> 17:04.956
<i> He can't do a lot on his own.</i>

17:05.058 --> 17:06.991
<i> So we help him out</i>
<i> when he needs us,</i>

17:07.093 --> 17:08.926
<i> when Amber</i>
<i>can't be there for him.</i>

17:09.029 --> 17:11.763
<i> But we're all scared for him</i>
<i> because of how bad it is now.</i>

17:11.865 --> 17:14.265
-You have your charger?
-Yes, everything's in there.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.466
-You sure?
-Yes.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.834
-Okay.
-You can't use mine.

17:16.936 --> 17:17.802
I know.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.437
<i>If he goes on this,</i>

17:19.539 --> 17:21.406
it would be benefit
for both of them.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.940
<i> Because if he can</i>
<i> lose the weight,</i>

17:23.043 --> 17:24.675
<i> it'd make</i>
<i> both their lives better.</i>

17:24.778 --> 17:26.911
-Are you excited?
-Yeah, I am.

17:27.013 --> 17:30.748
Nathan has struggled
with his weight
since I've known him.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.850
<i> Even early on,</i>
<i> I saw how he ate</i>

17:32.952 --> 17:36.421
and I remember
they had just moved down here.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.923
<i> And he got up and made</i>
<i> breakfast one morning</i>
<i> for himself.</i>

17:39.025 --> 17:43.194
<i> He made macaroni and cheese</i>
<i> and a can of peas</i>
<i> for breakfast.</i>

17:43.296 --> 17:44.962
<i> And I'm like going,</i>

17:45.065 --> 17:47.465
"Oh, that's disgusting."
[laughs]

17:47.567 --> 17:50.835
But over time, I've seen him
gain more weight.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.037
<i> And it's getting to</i>
<i> a breaking point for him</i>

17:53.139 --> 17:55.640
and I think Nathan
does understand.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.944
He is a young man
with a short lifespan
right now.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.551
[Tracie]
We are on the road. Yay.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.386
On the road again.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.687
[Nathan]<i> I'm a little</i>
<i> bit overwhelmed</i>

18:09.789 --> 18:11.622
<i> and I'm embarrassed</i>

18:11.724 --> 18:14.025
<i> because I'm starting to feel</i>
<i> a little bit of shame.</i>

18:14.127 --> 18:16.060
<i> I know I have to do this,</i>

18:16.162 --> 18:17.829
but it shouldn't have
gotten to this point.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.465
Isn't this
where I'm at right now.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.302
<i> I guess I'm a little shaky</i>

18:24.404 --> 18:29.006
because this may be
the last chance to save

18:29.109 --> 18:31.409
what I can see as my family
at this moment.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.482
<i> So I'm ready to make a change</i>
<i> to my life, no matter what.</i>

18:37.584 --> 18:39.050
[Jack] How much is that
going to be?

18:39.152 --> 18:40.818
-[cashier] Thank you.
-[Jack] Thank you.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.687
Ooh.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.993
[Nathan]
Best chicken fingers ever.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.530
<i>Because I know what's at stake</i>

18:52.632 --> 18:55.433
<i> to save my life</i>
<i> and save my family.</i>

18:55.535 --> 18:57.969
<i> And I'm not going to fail</i>
<i> and let them down.</i>

19:10.783 --> 19:11.949
[exhales]

19:24.631 --> 19:26.364
[Nathan]<i> I'm tired</i>
<i> and a little sore.</i>

19:28.301 --> 19:29.800
<i> But I'm in good spirits</i>

19:29.903 --> 19:31.903
<i> because I get to see</i>
<i> Dr. Now today</i>

19:32.805 --> 19:34.138
<i> and hopefully get his help.</i>

19:35.708 --> 19:38.042
<i> I think, overall,</i>
<i> I'm mostly just nervous</i>

19:38.144 --> 19:39.644
<i> about hearing what he says.</i>

19:42.348 --> 19:44.382
<i> So, I'm glad Tracie's</i>
<i> going to go with me</i>

19:44.484 --> 19:46.951
<i> and I have her support</i>
<i> so I'm not doing this alone.</i>

19:47.053 --> 19:48.920
<i> Because what happens today</i>
<i> at this appointment</i>

19:49.022 --> 19:50.421
<i> determines everything for me.</i>

19:54.928 --> 19:56.027
Mr. Prater?

20:13.346 --> 20:16.948
[Nathan]<i> And whatever</i>
<i> Dr. Now has for me to do,</i>

20:17.050 --> 20:20.785
<i>I'm ready to do it if it means</i>
<i> I can get a better life</i>
<i> for me and my family.</i>

20:29.262 --> 20:30.094
[Nathan grunts]

20:31.397 --> 20:33.464
<i> It's never fun seeing</i>
<i> my weight on the scale,</i>

20:33.566 --> 20:35.700
<i> especially knowing</i>
<i> other people</i>
<i> are seeing it too.</i>

20:36.436 --> 20:37.768
<i> It's embarrassing.</i>

20:37.870 --> 20:40.004
<i> But I know</i>
<i> my starting point now.</i>

20:40.106 --> 20:42.940
<i> So from here,</i>
<i> my goal is to get</i>
<i> that number going down.</i>

20:43.977 --> 20:44.976
[knock on door]

20:47.046 --> 20:49.480
-Hello, how are you all doing?
-I'm good. How are you?

20:50.483 --> 20:51.616
Good.

20:51.718 --> 20:55.152
All right, Nathan,
good to meet you.
Glad you're here.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.622
-Yes, sir.
-Now who's this
young lady with you?

20:57.724 --> 21:00.057
[chuckles] This is my
mother-in-law, Tracie.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.892
-Your mother-in-law?
-[Tracie] Yes.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.195
[Dr. Now] All right,
good to meet you both.

21:04.297 --> 21:07.164
-So, you come here
from Palestine, Texas, huh?
-[Nathan] Yes.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.900
And you're here to see me
to lose weight

21:10.003 --> 21:11.969
because you're just
over 600 pounds?

21:12.071 --> 21:14.305
-[Nathan] Yes.
-Is that the highest weight
you have been?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.906
That I know of, yes, sir.

21:16.009 --> 21:19.477
Okay. Well, that amount
of weight puts a lot of strain

21:19.579 --> 21:21.879
on your body,
especially at your height.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.248
And it doesn't take long
for your health

21:24.350 --> 21:26.417
to start deteriorating rapidly

21:26.519 --> 21:28.919
especially
if you're not very mobile.

21:29.689 --> 21:33.224
And how much you
can walk or be active?

21:33.326 --> 21:35.426
It hurts to...
Like, when I'm at home

21:35.528 --> 21:38.229
and if I go from the bathroom
back to my living room,

21:38.331 --> 21:39.230
I get winded.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.499
So I can't walk very far
without help.

21:41.601 --> 21:44.068
And what makes it worse
is that I have lymphedema.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.070
-[Dr. Now] Mmmhmm.
-And so there's issues

21:46.172 --> 21:48.706
with open sores on my legs.
My right leg.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.442
And I also have a growth
in the groin area.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.577
And it just... It feels like
it's getting bigger,

21:53.680 --> 21:54.945
so it pulls at the lower back

21:55.048 --> 21:58.282
and that's what's adding more
to the out of breath right now

21:58.384 --> 21:59.884
I think, I don't know.

21:59.986 --> 22:03.387
Okay. So you have
developed a lot of issues
from your weight.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.856
So you are at
a critical point now

22:05.958 --> 22:08.125
where you have to change
your eating habit

22:08.227 --> 22:10.394
before things
get worse for you.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.864
So how committed are you
to make the changes?

22:13.966 --> 22:16.734
I... I'm gonna have to be
100% committed.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.968
That's... That's it.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.904
-It's either that or--
-"I'm gonna have to be"

22:20.006 --> 22:21.572
is a figure of speech.

22:21.674 --> 22:27.778
[stammering] I will tell you
that I am going to be
100% committed.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.581
-So you are ready
to make the changes?
-[Nathan] Yes, sir.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.483
Okay. That's what
we wanna hear from you.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.285
So the changes
that we're gonna do,

22:34.387 --> 22:35.319
I don't want any excuses that,

22:35.421 --> 22:37.588
you know,
"The weather was not good,

22:37.690 --> 22:38.989
I was depressed,

22:39.092 --> 22:41.258
-and food was there,
I had to eat it."
-[inaudible]

22:41.361 --> 22:44.628
Those excuses, I don't wanna
hear them when you come back.

22:44.731 --> 22:45.863
-Right.
-[Dr. Now] Okay.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.599
And your wife, does she
struggle with her weight too?

22:48.701 --> 22:51.836
Yes. Um, she is
overweight as well.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.572
So why isn't she here
with you today?

22:55.341 --> 22:56.574
She had to work.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.276
Okay. So I'll give you
an extra copy
of the instructions

22:59.379 --> 23:01.979
for you to take to her
so she can understand

23:02.081 --> 23:04.115
what needs to be done
to support you.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.117
And the next time
you come back,

23:06.219 --> 23:07.718
see if she will come with you.

23:08.788 --> 23:09.987
Okay, Doctor.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.257
Okay. I'm gonna give you
some written instruction

23:13.359 --> 23:14.792
that I want you
to read every day

23:14.894 --> 23:16.961
and I'm gonna give you
some exercises.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.464
I want you to start
doing those exercises
twice a day. Okay?

23:20.566 --> 23:22.433
-Okay.
-Well, any questions?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.268
No, sir.

23:24.370 --> 23:27.938
All right. So let me get all
the stuff that you need to do

23:28.040 --> 23:30.141
-and then we go from there.
-Yes, sir.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.743
-All right. I'll be back.
-[Tracie] Okay. Thank you.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.850
[Dr. Now]
<i> Nathan seems motivated.</i>

23:39.952 --> 23:43.554
Hopefully, we see that
translate into action with him

23:43.656 --> 23:46.557
<i> to where he makes the changes</i>
<i> he needs when he goes home.</i>

23:46.659 --> 23:49.326
<i> But ultimately,</i>
<i> no matter the situation,</i>

23:49.429 --> 23:51.128
<i>this is all gonna be</i>
<i> up to Nathan</i>

23:51.230 --> 23:53.464
to make the changes he needs
to get healthy.

23:56.068 --> 23:59.069
All right, Nathan.
Here's your homework.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.172
<i>If Nathan wants to move ahead,</i>

24:01.274 --> 24:04.008
he's gonna have to prove
to me that he's committed.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.811
<i> So he either does this</i>
<i> and hits his goal</i>

24:06.913 --> 24:09.079
<i> to show me what I need</i>
<i> to see from him</i>

24:09.182 --> 24:11.315
or weight loss surgery
won't be an option.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.217
<i> Because it will</i>
<i> ultimately fail</i>

24:13.319 --> 24:16.487
if he isn't willing to do
at least his part.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.490
All right, Nathan. This is
something you have to do

24:19.592 --> 24:21.158
if you want to get
your life back

24:21.260 --> 24:22.426
before you run out of time.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.495
So you have a lot
of changes to make.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.763
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

24:25.865 --> 24:26.931
You think you can do that?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.866
Yes, I... I do.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.602
[Dr. Now] All right. Super.
So I see you in two months.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.204
Lose 60 pounds by then

24:33.306 --> 24:35.372
and work to get
your stamina up.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.875
In the meantime, if you have
any issues, give me a call.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.109
-Okay.
-[Dr. Now] All right.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.445
Before you go,
we're gonna run some tests

24:41.547 --> 24:42.847
to check on some things.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.749
And if everything looks good,
you can go home. Okay?

24:45.852 --> 24:47.184
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.385
Nice to meet you guys.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.553
[both] Nice meeting you.

24:53.459 --> 24:55.059
[Nathan]<i> That was intense</i>
<i> but it was good.</i>

24:55.161 --> 24:56.227
<i>And I'm excited</i>

24:56.329 --> 24:59.230
<i> because I have a plan</i>
<i> to fix what I messed up</i>

24:59.332 --> 25:01.532
<i> and finally make things</i>
<i> right like I should.</i>

25:03.236 --> 25:04.902
<i> So I'm happy about that,</i>

25:05.004 --> 25:06.504
<i> and that I have this chance.</i>

25:08.040 --> 25:09.974
<i> But I know it's not</i>
<i> going to be easy.</i>

25:10.076 --> 25:12.743
<i> It's gonna be a hard road</i>
<i> ahead to do this.</i>

25:12.845 --> 25:14.378
<i> But I'm ready for it.</i>

25:23.422 --> 25:25.222
[Dr. Now]
<i> Nathan is already developing</i>

25:25.324 --> 25:27.391
<i>severe medical issues</i>
<i> with his body</i>

25:27.493 --> 25:29.560
<i> that is a direct result</i>
<i> of his weight.</i>

25:29.662 --> 25:32.296
<i> So he doesn't have</i>
<i> any more time to waste.</i>

25:32.398 --> 25:35.299
<i>He either make the significant</i>
<i> changes he needs now</i>

25:35.401 --> 25:38.636
<i> or things are gonna continue</i>
<i> to get worse for him</i>

25:38.738 --> 25:41.438
until he pushes his body
to a breaking point.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.407
<i>And my concern right now</i>

25:43.509 --> 25:47.745
<i>is that he may a lot closer to</i>
<i> that point than he realizes.</i>

25:47.847 --> 25:50.114
So it's very important
he does this now

25:50.216 --> 25:52.416
<i> before he gets</i>
<i> to that breaking point</i>

25:52.518 --> 25:55.419
and something happens
where he doesn't make it.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.161
[Nathan] Ready?

26:04.263 --> 26:06.263
Oh, you better get up.
Go to the door.

26:06.966 --> 26:07.798
[grunts]

26:07.900 --> 26:08.799
[Nathan]<i> It's been three weeks</i>

26:08.901 --> 26:10.434
<i> since my appointment</i>
<i> with Dr. Now.</i>

26:10.903 --> 26:11.969
Whoa.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.271
<i> And since then, Amber and I</i>
<i> have been focusing</i>

26:14.373 --> 26:15.973
<i> on making</i>
<i> all the changes I need</i>

26:16.075 --> 26:17.975
<i> with the diet and exercises.</i>

26:18.077 --> 26:19.376
[Amber] Come here, Peanut Ann.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.345
[Nathan]<i> I feel like</i>
<i> my journey is in</i>
<i> a really good spot</i>

26:21.447 --> 26:24.114
<i> because I can finally see</i>
<i> something positive</i>

26:24.216 --> 26:25.282
<i> moving forward in my life.</i>

26:26.819 --> 26:28.886
<i> The most significant</i>
<i> is the energy.</i>

26:28.988 --> 26:31.288
<i> There's just some things</i>
<i>that I'm able to do physically</i>

26:31.390 --> 26:34.525
<i> that I couldn't do</i>
<i> 20 days ago.</i>

26:34.627 --> 26:37.194
<i> So I actually look forward</i>
<i> to exercise now.</i>

26:37.296 --> 26:39.430
[Amber] Come on, this way.
Come on, mama.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.365
[Nathan]<i> Walking with Amber,</i>

26:41.467 --> 26:43.133
<i> she always</i>
<i> has a good attitude.</i>

26:43.903 --> 26:44.969
[Amber exhales]

26:45.071 --> 26:47.371
[Nathan]<i> I think</i>
<i> our relationship has changed</i>

26:47.473 --> 26:48.839
<i> for the positive.</i>

26:48.941 --> 26:52.343
<i> I feel like we're headed</i>
<i> towards a better situation.</i>

26:54.847 --> 26:58.048
[Amber]<i> Nathan's actually been</i>
<i> better than I expected.</i>

26:58.150 --> 27:00.217
<i> As soon as</i>
<i> we got back to town,</i>

27:00.319 --> 27:05.089
<i> with counting calories</i>
<i> and his exercise...</i>

27:05.191 --> 27:07.725
[Nathan] No,
stop eating everything.

27:07.827 --> 27:11.562
[Amber]<i> ...he jumped right in,</i>
<i> so I was really impressed</i>

27:11.664 --> 27:14.932
<i> and I would say overall</i>
<i> he's doing great.</i>

27:15.034 --> 27:19.403
<i> So I really expected him to</i>
<i> struggle more than he has.</i>

27:19.505 --> 27:21.372
[Nathan] I don't even know
how far we walked.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.873
[Amber]
About an eighth of a mile.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.175
-Oh. Well, we can turn
around if you need to.
-No, till the stop sign.

27:26.178 --> 27:29.079
[Amber] I'm good.
I just... It hurts.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.581
[panting]

27:30.683 --> 27:33.717
[Nathan]<i> I try to walk</i>
<i> every day for, like,</i>
<i> 20 to 30 minutes.</i>

27:34.687 --> 27:37.287
<i> The changes have been</i>
<i> pretty easy for me</i>

27:37.390 --> 27:41.692
<i> because I just got to a point</i>
<i> where I chose life.</i>

27:42.461 --> 27:45.729
-You made it to the store.
-Yeah?

27:45.831 --> 27:48.032
-How you feel?
-I'm good.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.566
You're not too out of breath.
That's good.

27:51.537 --> 27:52.603
Are you ready?

27:52.705 --> 27:53.971
[exhales] Yeah.

27:54.974 --> 27:55.973
I think so.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.376
-All right.
You first this time.
-All right.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.744
-Let's go, Big T.
-Let him take the charge

28:00.846 --> 28:02.046
and the lead.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.313
-Me and Peanut
will go towards the end.
-You know he will.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.782
-This way. Go home.
-We're going home.

28:04.884 --> 28:05.983
Let's go home.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.790
[Nathan]<i> The transition</i>
<i> to eating healthier</i>

28:12.892 --> 28:14.591
<i> has been a lot easier</i>
<i> than I thought.</i>

28:14.694 --> 28:17.928
<i> I try to stick to</i>
<i> the 1,200 calories or less...</i>

28:18.030 --> 28:19.463
[clicking]

28:19.565 --> 28:23.000
<i> ...not allowing myself</i>
<i> to just eat what I want to</i>
<i> when I want to.</i>

28:24.370 --> 28:25.569
<i>Going into it, I was like,</i>

28:25.671 --> 28:27.604
<i> "I'm gonna have to eat all</i>
<i>this stuff that I don't like."</i>

28:27.707 --> 28:31.275
<i> Well, when I figured out that</i>
<i> I could stay under the 1,200</i>

28:31.377 --> 28:33.243
<i> and work hard</i>
<i> and still lose the weight,</i>

28:33.345 --> 28:34.912
<i> I was like,</i>
<i> "I'm gonna do this."</i>

28:35.948 --> 28:39.783
<i> And so if I feel the urge</i>
<i> to have ice cream,</i>

28:39.885 --> 28:41.485
<i> I always make sure</i>
<i> that it still falls</i>

28:41.587 --> 28:43.854
<i> under that 1,200 calories</i>
<i> or less.</i>

28:43.956 --> 28:45.823
<i> I'm still getting</i>
<i> my little fix</i>

28:45.925 --> 28:48.358
<i> but I'm staying</i>
<i> under the calorie count.</i>

28:48.461 --> 28:49.993
Remember how
I would get, like,

28:50.096 --> 28:53.430
a chicken and a burrito
and two Big Reds?

28:54.133 --> 28:55.065
[Amber] Yeah.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.501
That has changed a lot.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.970
Why would I do that?

29:00.072 --> 29:02.039
-[Amber] Well...
-And why would you let me?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.974
It's not about
what I would let you do.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.178
What would you do
if I went back to that?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.047
[Amber] Well, I don't know...

29:11.584 --> 29:14.017
to be perfectly honest

29:14.120 --> 29:17.321
because I've already told you
how I feel about things
as they were.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.457
How much bacon do you want?

29:21.060 --> 29:22.226
Just a couple of slices.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.595
[Nathan] How do you feel?

29:24.697 --> 29:27.464
[Amber] I mean,
I already told you, like,
it's too much for me. I'm...

29:27.566 --> 29:30.234
I'm your caregiver.
I'm not your wife, so...

29:37.576 --> 29:38.742
[bacon sizzling]

29:48.687 --> 29:51.822
[Nathan] All right.
In 2.5 miles, you're gonna
exit 125A.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.825
[Amber] Hello! I know
where I'm going kind of.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.161
[Nathan]<i> Amber and I</i>
<i> are in Houston</i>

29:57.263 --> 29:59.530
<i> for my second appointment</i>
<i> with Dr. Now.</i>

29:59.632 --> 30:01.431
<i> I told her how important</i>
<i> it was to me</i>

30:01.534 --> 30:03.600
<i> for her to be the one</i>
<i> that brought here.</i>

30:03.702 --> 30:04.768
[Nathan] It's on the corner
right there.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.270
See where that red car is?

30:06.372 --> 30:07.538
[Amber]<i> Voila.</i>

30:17.616 --> 30:20.684
[Nathan]<i> 'Cause I want her</i>
<i> to see the progress</i>
<i> that I'm going to have.</i>

30:24.857 --> 30:27.024
<i> So she made the time to do</i>
<i> this with me today</i>

30:27.126 --> 30:27.991
<i> and that means a lot.</i>

30:30.229 --> 30:32.763
<i> And I'm feeling better</i>
<i> than I have in years.</i>

30:32.865 --> 30:35.999
<i> I made all the changes</i>
<i> and followed all of</i>
<i> Dr. Now's instructions.</i>

30:37.870 --> 30:39.503
-Nathan.
-[Nathan whispers] You ready?

30:41.507 --> 30:44.107
<i> So whatever the scale says,</i>
<i> I think it's going to be</i>

30:44.210 --> 30:46.543
<i> something I'm at least</i>
<i> proud of.</i>

30:46.645 --> 30:49.313
<i>But my ultimate goal is to get</i>
<i> weight loss surgery.</i>

30:49.415 --> 30:51.815
<i> And that's not gonna happen</i>
<i> if I didn't lose</i>

30:51.917 --> 30:54.251
<i> all that I was supposed</i>
<i> to lose by today.</i>

30:54.353 --> 30:55.419
[nurse]
We're gonna weigh you.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.287
-Just hold on one second.
-Yes, ma'am.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.488
[nurse]
Let me just level it out.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.792
Okay.

31:01.894 --> 31:04.328
-Go ahead and step up
on the scale, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.797
[Nathan]<i> And if I don't get</i>
<i> weight loss surgery,</i>

31:06.899 --> 31:09.333
<i> all I've lost today</i>
<i> won't mean anything.</i>

31:22.715 --> 31:25.048
[Nathan]<i> I'm back at Dr. Now's</i>
<i> for my second appointment</i>

31:25.150 --> 31:27.150
<i> to see if I made it</i>
<i> to my weight loss goal.</i>

31:27.253 --> 31:29.386
<i> And I think I have</i>
<i> a good chance at it today.</i>

31:29.488 --> 31:32.990
<i> At my last appointment,</i>
<i> I was 607 pounds.</i>

31:33.092 --> 31:37.628
<i>And Dr. Now told me to lose at</i>
<i>least 60 pounds in two months.</i>

31:37.730 --> 31:41.131
<i> So that means I need to be</i>
<i> under 547 pounds today.</i>

31:44.837 --> 31:47.204
Wow. [chuckles] I'm excited.

31:47.306 --> 31:48.305
Good for you.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.502
I'm good. I'm good.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.270
[knock on door]

32:22.775 --> 32:24.775
-Hello, how are y'all doing?
-[Nathan] Good. How are you?

32:25.377 --> 32:26.677
[Dr. Now] I'm doing good.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.779
This must be your wife, Amber.

32:28.881 --> 32:31.014
-Yes, sir.
-Well, good to meet you.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.249
[Amber] Good to meet you.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.285
-So, Nathan,
you're down 72 pounds, huh?
-Yes, sir.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.487
So tell me
what changes you made.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.123
The biggest change
that I've made

32:40.225 --> 32:43.593
is I've really stuck
to the 1,200 calories or less.

32:43.696 --> 32:45.629
That's the ultimate
bottom line for me.

32:45.731 --> 32:49.566
Plus, I will not eat anything
past six o'clock.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.601
I just... I've made it a point
to make sure that

32:51.704 --> 32:53.937
I have dinner
before 5:00, 5:30, so.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.539
[Dr. Now] All right.
That's great.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.974
Well, I'm proud of you.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.242
But my concern right now,
seeing both of you,

32:59.345 --> 33:02.145
is your wife
has a weight problem, too.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.815
So it's very hard
for one person in a family

33:04.917 --> 33:07.951
to eat healthy while
the other person is not.

33:08.053 --> 33:10.988
So, Amber, have you talked
about getting healthy

33:11.090 --> 33:13.223
and doing this with Nathan?

33:13.325 --> 33:17.427
Um, I actually already
had weight loss surgery
when I was 16.

33:17.529 --> 33:21.498
And so I'm really familiar
with the weight loss process.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.767
And I already kind of had

33:23.869 --> 33:25.969
somewhat better eating habits
than he did.

33:26.071 --> 33:28.405
I've been preparing food
for the last ten years

33:28.507 --> 33:30.173
to his accommodations really.

33:30.275 --> 33:33.176
So you're saying it's his
fault he gained weight?

33:33.278 --> 33:34.945
[Amber] Not necessarily.

33:35.047 --> 33:38.081
Okay. Then would you
consider yourself

33:38.183 --> 33:40.917
failure of the weight loss
surgery or success?

33:41.754 --> 33:42.819
-Me?
-[Dr. Now] Yeah.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.121
I would say I was success...

33:44.223 --> 33:46.590
I was a success
until I had my children.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.658
Because I was very successful,

33:48.761 --> 33:52.095
I lost over 360 pounds
on my first...

33:52.197 --> 33:53.497
With my first surgery.

33:53.599 --> 33:56.266
Well, you're like a gambler
sitting at the table
and saying--

33:56.368 --> 33:57.267
[both laughing]

33:57.369 --> 33:59.336
..."An hour ago,
I had a million dollars

33:59.438 --> 34:01.838
but then right now,
I'm out of everything.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.274
So I was a
successful gambler."

34:04.376 --> 34:06.643
That's not the reality.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.346
Where are you at this point
and what you need to do

34:09.448 --> 34:10.380
is the issue.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.016
Now, you may consider
that a lot surgeons,

34:13.118 --> 34:16.186
they don't do revision
because that's complicated

34:16.288 --> 34:19.022
and it's not something that
your surgeon are acquainted

34:19.124 --> 34:20.223
or willing to do,

34:20.325 --> 34:23.226
but that's something
we may be able to perform.

34:23.328 --> 34:27.564
People in the high BMI,
90 to 95%,

34:27.666 --> 34:30.901
have failure of their weight
loss surgery in ten years.

34:31.003 --> 34:34.571
And the reason for that being
that the underlying issues

34:34.673 --> 34:37.874
driving you to eat
were never fully addressed.

34:37.976 --> 34:40.811
And in your case, your success
was only short term.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.579
And that's a factor now,

34:42.681 --> 34:45.549
not just in your health,
but Nathan's health

34:45.651 --> 34:49.453
Because you both influence
each other negatively.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.823
<i> I'm frustrated and angry</i>

34:52.925 --> 34:56.393
because this journey
was supposed to truly be
about Nathan

34:56.495 --> 34:58.662
and Nathan's health
and his well-being.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.665
And I don't want
to take away from that

35:01.767 --> 35:04.101
and I feel like
that's going to happen.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.502
And I don't want
that to happen.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.538
I was 16 when I had
a procedure done

35:08.640 --> 35:12.342
and now I'm 60 pounds
heavier than I was
when I started that.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.680
There's just not words
for that emotion right now.

35:16.782 --> 35:20.584
So I think the dynamic
of household will be better

35:20.686 --> 35:23.053
if you both are working
to get healthy together

35:23.155 --> 35:25.689
so that both of you
are in the same situation

35:25.791 --> 35:27.290
with the eating habit

35:27.392 --> 35:29.793
and able to
manage it together.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.629
So is that something
you're interested in?

35:32.731 --> 35:34.931
Yes. I think
I'd like to do that.

35:35.033 --> 35:38.268
Okay. Nathan,
because you hit your goal,

35:38.370 --> 35:40.237
since you have made
good progress,

35:40.339 --> 35:41.805
I'm gonna go ahead
and approve you

35:41.907 --> 35:43.573
-for weight loss surgery.
-Yes.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.143
-[Amber] Yay!
-Oh, thank God.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.777
[Dr. Now] Okay. All right.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.980
So we'll schedule that
for next month.

35:50.082 --> 35:52.883
In the meantime,
don't let your guard down.

35:52.985 --> 35:55.418
Just stay on track
and keep losing weight.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.586
-Okay.
-[Dr. Now] Okay?

35:56.688 --> 35:59.422
But we need to do
some more testing on you

35:59.525 --> 36:01.958
to make sure that
the surgery is gonna be

36:02.060 --> 36:03.393
a safe option for you

36:03.495 --> 36:05.996
and if everything looks good
and you still are trying,

36:06.098 --> 36:09.733
then we will proceed
with weight loss surgery
here very soon.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.101
-Okay?
-Okay.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.004
All right. So let's set you
for some testing

36:14.106 --> 36:15.305
and go from there.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.307
But right now, let's get
your weight, Amber,

36:17.409 --> 36:18.642
to see where you're at

36:18.744 --> 36:21.511
and I'll get some instruction
to go over with you.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.612
Yes, sir.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.851
<i> Nathan is doing very well</i>

36:27.953 --> 36:29.986
and I'm proud
of the progress he's made

36:30.088 --> 36:31.621
over the last two months.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.624
So I'm confident he's ready
for weight loss surgery.

36:34.726 --> 36:38.528
But my concern right now
is Amber and her health

36:38.630 --> 36:42.132
and how that's gonna affect
both of them going forward.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.302
Are you gonna look
into the revisions?

36:45.404 --> 36:47.270
I mean,
I'll look into it again.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.406
But I have before,
I'll do it again.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.808
Is that something you want?

36:53.145 --> 36:55.011
I hadn't really
thought about it much.

36:55.113 --> 36:58.982
Okay, Amber. I'm gonna
start a chart on you, okay?

36:59.084 --> 37:00.317
And we check your weight
and all that.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.485
-That's if you want to.
-Yeah.

37:02.588 --> 37:03.687
[Dr. Now] Okay.

37:03.789 --> 37:04.988
That's what you want, right?

37:05.090 --> 37:05.956
-[Amber] Yes, sir.
-Okay.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.624
So let's do that now.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.396
<i> Amber seems to blame Nathan</i>

37:13.498 --> 37:15.665
for most of their poor
eating habits

37:15.767 --> 37:18.535
<i> and has excuses</i>
<i> for why she got them</i>

37:18.637 --> 37:20.470
to the weight she is.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.639
Okay, you can step up
on the scale.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.809
Do I need to turn
around backwards?

37:32.184 --> 37:33.450
Your weight is 502.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.687
<i> But the reality is that</i>
<i> at her size,</i>

37:37.789 --> 37:40.056
she's eating
because she wants to eat

37:40.158 --> 37:42.425
<i> and so she shares</i>
<i> some of the blame</i>

37:42.527 --> 37:43.927
for their dynamic as well.

37:45.197 --> 37:48.265
<i> And if she doesn't take</i>
<i> responsibility for her part</i>

37:48.367 --> 37:50.200
in their unhealthy dynamic

37:50.302 --> 37:53.603
<i> and how her behavior</i>
<i> influenced Nathan negatively</i>

37:53.705 --> 37:56.339
just as much as
his does to her.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.042
Then it will be unlikely
either of them

37:59.144 --> 38:01.378
will be successful
making any progress

38:01.480 --> 38:03.580
that will last the long term.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.849
<i> Hopefully,</i>
<i> she considers the option</i>

38:05.951 --> 38:08.251
<i>to change her unhealthy habits</i>

38:08.353 --> 38:10.287
<i>and ultimately, get a revision</i>

38:10.389 --> 38:13.490
to her previous weight loss
surgery that she has failed.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.296
All right.

38:19.398 --> 38:23.800
Well, Amber, you are just
over 500 pounds. 502.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.101
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

38:25.203 --> 38:28.938
So your weight
is less than Nathan

38:29.041 --> 38:30.407
but at your height,

38:30.509 --> 38:34.277
your BMI is 20 points
higher than Nathan.

38:34.379 --> 38:36.980
So your weight is putting
more strain on your body

38:37.082 --> 38:38.915
than his weight is on him.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.484
So what we need to do
is also work with you

38:41.586 --> 38:43.386
to get you to lose weight.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.156
So I want you
to read these every night.

38:46.258 --> 38:49.092
-Yes, sir.
-And start working on that.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.494
So both of you
have the same instruction.

38:51.596 --> 38:54.431
And, Nathan, I want you to
stick with what you are doing.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.633
And Amber, I want you
to lose 50 pounds

38:56.735 --> 38:58.201
over the next two months.

38:58.870 --> 38:59.869
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

38:59.971 --> 39:02.639
But first step is to change
your eating habit.

39:02.741 --> 39:05.342
So make sure you only eat
two or three times a day,

39:05.444 --> 39:06.443
no snacking,

39:06.545 --> 39:09.579
and your daily limit
is 1,200 calories. No more.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.814
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.416
All right, Nathan,
I'll see you in the hospital

39:13.518 --> 39:15.352
-and we go from there, okay?
-Yes, sir.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.954
And if either of you
need anything, give me a call.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.189
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

39:19.291 --> 39:20.790
-I'll see you later.
-All right. See you later.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.225
Thank you, Dr. Now.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.000
[Nathan]<i> I'm extremely excited</i>
<i> that I got approved</i>

39:31.103 --> 39:32.135
<i> for weight loss surgery</i>

39:32.237 --> 39:34.003
<i> because that's something</i>
<i> I've wanted</i>

39:34.106 --> 39:35.638
<i> for a really long time.</i>

39:35.741 --> 39:37.974
<i> The fact that</i>
<i> she responded to Dr. Now</i>

39:38.076 --> 39:40.443
<i> and told him she'd consider</i>
<i> doing his program</i>

39:40.545 --> 39:41.745
<i> has me excited.</i>

39:42.481 --> 39:43.947
<i>Because one of my big fears</i>

39:44.049 --> 39:46.316
<i> is how our relationship</i>
<i> became about food</i>

39:46.418 --> 39:48.785
<i> and what losing the only</i>
<i> thing we have to bond over</i>

39:48.887 --> 39:50.053
<i> could mean for us.</i>

39:50.155 --> 39:52.555
<i> So if we have doing this</i>
<i> to bond over now,</i>

39:52.657 --> 39:53.757
<i> that'd be incredible.</i>

39:53.859 --> 39:55.692
<i> And if she could get another</i>
<i> weight loss surgery,</i>

39:55.794 --> 39:56.960
<i> I think it'd be amazing</i>

39:57.062 --> 39:58.695
<i> because there's so much</i>
<i> we want to do</i>

39:58.797 --> 40:01.297
<i> that we haven't been able</i>
<i> to do because of our weight.</i>

40:01.400 --> 40:04.401
<i> Then we can build a new life</i>
<i> we've dreamed of together.</i>

40:33.098 --> 40:35.064
[Nathan]<i> After the last</i>
<i> appointment with Dr. Now,</i>

40:35.167 --> 40:37.367
<i> Amber and I came</i>
<i> back home to Palestine.</i>

40:40.605 --> 40:42.572
<i> And after a day or two,</i>
<i> Amber was able</i>

40:42.674 --> 40:44.607
<i> to think through</i>
<i> Dr. Now's offer</i>

40:44.709 --> 40:48.445
<i> to do his program</i>
<i> and try to get a revision</i>
<i> to her weight loss surgery.</i>

40:51.149 --> 40:53.183
[Amber]<i> You know,</i>
<i> when Dr. Now approached me</i>

40:53.285 --> 40:55.718
<i> when Nathan was there</i>
<i> to be seen,</i>

40:55.821 --> 40:57.253
I was angry.
I was really angry,

40:57.355 --> 41:01.591
And I was hurt,
because I felt blindsided.

41:01.693 --> 41:04.527
But once I had time
to process,

41:04.629 --> 41:07.564
I was overjoyed.

41:07.666 --> 41:13.236
<i> Because just knowing that</i>
<i> Dr. Now is willing to help me</i>

41:13.338 --> 41:16.973
just makes me blessed
and makes me excited now.

41:18.477 --> 41:20.243
[Nathan]<i> And so,</i>
<i> I'm happy about that.</i>

41:20.345 --> 41:23.746
<i>And I'm just really happy that</i>
<i>we're doing this together now.</i>

41:23.849 --> 41:25.615
[Amber] What are you
gonna get, dude?

41:25.717 --> 41:30.320
-I'm thinking the lunch
Swiss chicken, maybe?
-Okay.

41:30.422 --> 41:32.455
Um, but what do I want today?

41:32.557 --> 41:33.756
Oh, I love their potato soup.

41:33.859 --> 41:34.991
Would you like
any appetizers today?

41:35.093 --> 41:36.593
Montreal steak? Fries?

41:41.366 --> 41:44.267
-No.
-[chuckles]

41:44.369 --> 41:46.302
[Amber]<i> It's also been</i>
<i> a big motivation for me</i>

41:46.404 --> 41:48.338
<i> to see how</i>
<i> Nathan's been doing.</i>

41:48.440 --> 41:50.907
<i> But I still do worry</i>

41:51.009 --> 41:53.409
<i> because Nathan</i>
<i> has the tendencies</i>

41:53.512 --> 41:54.711
<i> to go back to his old habits.</i>

41:54.813 --> 41:56.946
Broccoli and mac and cheese,
and a broccoli... [inaudible]

41:57.048 --> 42:00.750
[Amber]<i> So there's still</i>
<i> the possibility of failure.</i>

42:00.852 --> 42:02.385
<i> But I'm trying to keep...</i>

42:03.755 --> 42:06.089
<i> -as optimistic as possible.</i>
-Thank you.

42:06.691 --> 42:07.690
So what do you think?

42:07.792 --> 42:09.125
'Cause this is our first time
eating out

42:09.227 --> 42:12.595
since you've had your...
Been on your little journey.

42:12.697 --> 42:15.198
-Like, out in public.
-Mmmhmm.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.000
How do you think
you're gonna do?

42:17.102 --> 42:18.368
'Cause you got
a smaller meal,

42:18.470 --> 42:20.436
you think
you're gonna be hungry...

42:20.539 --> 42:22.639
afterwards? You think...

42:22.741 --> 42:26.643
-Probably shouldn't think
about it. [chuckles] I mean...
-I guess so.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.444
It's one of those things
that you just can't plan.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.947
I was nervous
going to the restaurant

42:31.049 --> 42:32.882
because that restaurant
in particular,

42:32.984 --> 42:35.785
<i> I normally would get</i>
<i> all this stuff</i>

42:35.887 --> 42:38.855
<i> that is insanely unhealthy.</i>

42:38.957 --> 42:40.223
<i> But I went in there</i>
<i> with the idea of</i>

42:40.325 --> 42:44.227
" have got to make sure that
I start making good choices."

42:44.329 --> 42:46.329
Otherwise, what was
the point of me

42:46.431 --> 42:48.631
<i> going through the whole</i>
<i> journey in the first place?</i>

42:48.733 --> 42:51.401
<i> I am definitely ready</i>
<i> for surgery.</i>

42:51.503 --> 42:53.603
<i> I pray that</i>
<i> it happens next week.</i>

43:22.133 --> 43:23.633
[woman speaking indistinctly
over PA system]

43:25.203 --> 43:27.870
Will you help me put these on?
I never get these on right.

43:28.540 --> 43:29.539
I can do that.

43:30.542 --> 43:32.041
They're gray this time.

43:32.143 --> 43:35.345
<i> We're here at the hospital</i>
<i> for my weight loss surgery.</i>

43:35.447 --> 43:36.913
[Amber] They were bigger.

43:37.015 --> 43:40.083
[Nathan]<i> I'm excited</i>
<i> to finally get something</i>
<i> I've needed for years.</i>

43:40.185 --> 43:41.284
[Amber speaking indistinctly]

43:44.856 --> 43:45.722
[knock on door]

43:48.493 --> 43:50.526
-Good morning.
-[both] Good morning.

43:50.629 --> 43:52.929
-How are y'all doing?
-[both] Good.

43:53.031 --> 43:55.565
All right. Nathan, you're
ready for your big day today?

43:55.667 --> 43:58.101
-I am.
-All right.

43:58.203 --> 44:00.203
So far, you have done good job
on losing weight.

44:00.305 --> 44:03.206
And that make, uh, surgery
and risks much less.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.273
So you're doing good.

44:04.376 --> 44:06.709
-And you're ready for this.
-Thank you.

44:06.811 --> 44:08.411
All right. We're gonna
get you started, okay?

44:08.513 --> 44:09.812
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

44:09.914 --> 44:11.147
We'll see you
in a few minutes.

44:16.087 --> 44:18.254
[nurse] We'll lift your head
and arms, is that... Good.

44:18.356 --> 44:21.391
[Nathan]<i> I don't take</i>
<i> for granted what today means.</i>

44:21.493 --> 44:23.159
<i> And how important</i>
<i> this is for me.</i>

44:23.261 --> 44:25.561
-[nurse speaking indistinctly]
-[air kisses] Love you.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.830
<i> Because I'm starting</i>
<i> a new life today,</i>

44:27.932 --> 44:30.166
<i> so this is kind of like</i>
<i> a birth in a weird way.</i>

44:30.268 --> 44:32.435
<i> Because it's the official</i>
<i> start of the new me.</i>

44:32.537 --> 44:36.139
<i> So I'm excited about that</i>
<i> and the fresh start</i>
<i> that it's gonna give me.</i>

44:36.241 --> 44:39.008
<i> Because I'm leaving</i>
<i> the old me behind.</i>

44:39.110 --> 44:42.745
<i> And when I wake up,</i>
<i> I'm going to be a new person</i>
<i> ready for a new life.</i>

44:43.948 --> 44:45.548
<i> And I can't wait for that.</i>

44:52.924 --> 44:56.793
[Dr. Now]<i> Today,</i>
<i> we're gonna attempt to do</i>
<i> a gastric sleeve on Nathan.</i>

44:56.895 --> 44:58.661
<i>So far, he's done a great job,</i>

44:58.763 --> 45:00.530
<i> and he's continued</i>
<i> to lose weight</i>

45:00.632 --> 45:03.499
<i> and lost another 14 pounds</i>
<i> this past month.</i>

45:03.601 --> 45:05.334
<i> He's down to 521,</i>

45:05.437 --> 45:07.603
<i> so he's moderated</i>
<i> and he's working hard,</i>

45:07.706 --> 45:09.872
<i> then started doing</i>
<i> what he needs.</i>

45:09.974 --> 45:13.042
<i> So I think he's ready</i>
<i> for his weight loss surgery,</i>

45:13.144 --> 45:14.410
All right. Give me a knife.

45:18.616 --> 45:20.183
[surgeon]
Room lights off, please.

45:20.285 --> 45:22.318
[Dr. Now]<i> But he's still</i>
<i> around 500 pounds,</i>

45:22.420 --> 45:23.686
<i> and he's not very tall,</i>

45:23.788 --> 45:26.422
<i> So this still is gonna be</i>
<i> high-risk surgery.</i>

45:28.460 --> 45:31.260
Okay. Let's transition now.
Bring the robot.

45:31.930 --> 45:33.129
<i>Because all that weight</i>

45:33.231 --> 45:36.232
<i> is putting a significant</i>
<i> amount of strain on his body,</i>

45:36.334 --> 45:38.334
<i> to where any number</i>
<i> of small things</i>

45:38.436 --> 45:40.703
<i> can push his body</i>
<i> to the limit.</i>

45:40.805 --> 45:42.538
<i>So we have to be careful today</i>

45:42.640 --> 45:45.341
<i> to make sure</i>
<i> that doesn't happen.</i>

45:45.443 --> 45:50.079
<i> The greatest factor with that</i>
<i> is how long he has to be</i>
<i> under anesthesia.</i>

45:50.181 --> 45:52.048
<i> Because the longer</i>
<i> he is under,</i>

45:52.150 --> 45:54.417
<i> the more strain</i>
<i> there will be on his body.</i>

45:54.519 --> 45:56.886
<i> But I'm hoping</i>
<i> that using a robot</i>

45:56.988 --> 45:59.555
<i>will help us safely go faster,</i>

45:59.657 --> 46:02.592
<i> so the surgery would not be</i>
<i> a long operation.</i>

46:02.694 --> 46:06.062
<i> Then, hopefully, we'll be able</i>
<i> to complete it without issue.</i>

46:06.164 --> 46:08.731
<i> And give Nathan</i>
<i> an important tool</i>

46:08.833 --> 46:11.033
<i> that will help him</i>
<i> lose more weight</i>

46:11.136 --> 46:15.438
<i> because what this surgery does</i>
<i> is reduce the stomach by 90%,</i>

46:15.540 --> 46:19.742
<i> leaving a small narrow tube</i>
<i> that looks similar</i>
<i> to a sleeve.</i>

46:19.844 --> 46:23.379
So the patient's food
intake is physically limited

46:23.481 --> 46:26.415
<i> and the patient</i>
<i> is less hungry,</i>

46:26.518 --> 46:29.619
So this operation
will give them an opportunity

46:29.721 --> 46:31.554
<i> to lose even more weight.</i>

46:37.695 --> 46:40.062
[Amber]
<i> I am waiting to hear that</i>

46:40.165 --> 46:43.299
<i> Nathan is recovering</i>
<i> so I can see him.</i>

46:43.401 --> 46:44.934
<i> I'm not worried,</i>

46:45.036 --> 46:48.204
because this surgery
is something
that is done so often.

46:48.306 --> 46:51.274
<i> But sometimes things,</i>
<i> you know, happen</i>

46:51.376 --> 46:53.776
<i> when you're in surgery</i>
<i> and under anesthesia.</i>

46:53.878 --> 46:55.244
<i> So I'm looking forward to...</i>

46:55.346 --> 46:58.748
Just knowing that
he's come through
everything successfully.

46:58.850 --> 47:01.484
<i> So I'm just trying</i>
<i> not to get too overanxious.</i>

47:05.156 --> 47:07.156
[Dr. Now speaking]

47:29.781 --> 47:31.447
Okay. All finished.

47:37.455 --> 47:39.288
<i> Nathan's surgery</i>
<i> went very well.</i>

47:39.390 --> 47:41.824
<i> We were able to complete</i>
<i> his sleeve gastrectomy,</i>

47:41.926 --> 47:43.593
<i>and, uh, he's doing very well.</i>

47:44.863 --> 47:47.930
<i>Nathan had a very long stomach</i>
<i> and big stomach.</i>

47:48.032 --> 47:52.034
<i> We were able to remove</i>
<i> 80-85% of his stomach.</i>

47:53.271 --> 47:56.706
And this is Nathan's stomach
we took out. It's a...

47:57.475 --> 47:58.875
very long stomach.

47:58.977 --> 48:01.677
And it can hold a lot of food.

48:01.779 --> 48:05.448
<i> So he's gonna be able</i>
<i> to lose weight much easier</i>
<i> after surgery,</i>

48:05.550 --> 48:07.783
<i> because he's gonna be able</i>
<i> to eat small amount,</i>

48:07.886 --> 48:09.986
<i> get full real quick</i>
<i> and not be as hungry.</i>

48:10.088 --> 48:12.188
<i> And operation's</i>
<i> gonna give Nathan</i>

48:12.290 --> 48:14.857
<i> a better chance</i>
<i> to control his eating habit</i>

48:14.959 --> 48:16.459
<i>and lose more weight</i>

48:16.561 --> 48:19.061
<i> and get closer</i>
<i> to his ideal body weight.</i>

48:19.163 --> 48:22.465
<i> So having the stomach</i>
<i>reduce capacity by this amount</i>

48:22.567 --> 48:24.901
<i> will help him</i>
<i> to get full faster.</i>

48:25.003 --> 48:27.336
<i> For the next month,</i>
<i> Nathan will need to stay</i>

48:27.438 --> 48:29.639
<i> on liquid diet</i>
<i> until he fully heals.</i>

48:29.741 --> 48:31.073
<i>But, during that first month,</i>

48:31.175 --> 48:33.809
he's gonna be able to lose
at least 40 pounds.

48:33.912 --> 48:36.145
<i> Then, once he goes back</i>
<i> on solids,</i>

48:36.247 --> 48:39.382
<i> he should be able to lose</i>
<i> at least 20 pounds each month</i>

48:39.484 --> 48:41.717
<i> until he gets close</i>
<i> to his target weight.</i>

48:41.819 --> 48:44.720
<i> So this surgery will help</i>
<i> keep Nathan on track</i>

48:44.822 --> 48:47.523
<i> while we work to address</i>
<i> the underlying issues</i>

48:47.625 --> 48:50.259
<i> and the dynamic behind</i>
<i> all this unhealthy eating.</i>

48:50.361 --> 48:51.994
<i> But I think</i>
<i> he's gonna do very well.</i>

48:52.096 --> 48:54.897
I'm a little bit more
concerned about Amber,

48:54.999 --> 48:56.999
<i> because she already had</i>
<i> the weight loss surgery.</i>

48:57.101 --> 48:59.769
<i> So she already has had</i>
<i> a tool to help her,</i>

48:59.871 --> 49:02.004
<i> and it failed</i>
<i> because she ultimately</i>

49:02.106 --> 49:04.840
<i> didn't stick to doing</i>
<i> what she needed.</i>

49:04.943 --> 49:07.243
<i> But hopefully,</i>
<i> at next month's appointment,</i>

49:07.345 --> 49:09.345
<i> we will see</i>
<i> enough progress from her</i>

49:09.447 --> 49:11.447
<i> to show me she's trying</i>
<i> to turn things around</i>

49:11.549 --> 49:13.849
<i> so we can move ahead</i>
<i> with her weight loss surgery</i>

49:13.952 --> 49:16.352
<i> and start working</i>
<i> on addressing the issues</i>

49:16.454 --> 49:18.254
<i> driving both of them to eat,</i>

49:18.356 --> 49:20.189
<i> so that they both</i>
<i> can have a chance</i>

49:20.291 --> 49:22.425
<i> to be successful</i>
<i> in the long term.</i>

49:22.527 --> 49:25.394
<i> But we have a long way to go,</i>
<i> and a lot of work to do</i>

49:25.496 --> 49:28.397
<i> with both of them</i>
<i> to get them to that point.</i>

49:44.582 --> 49:45.848
[Amber] Okay, so...

49:46.584 --> 49:48.217
Breakfast...

49:48.319 --> 49:51.153
An egg, please.
You're gonna scramble?

49:51.255 --> 49:52.955
No, I thought
I'd just, you know,

49:53.057 --> 49:54.890
bounce it off the floor
and see if it works.

49:54.993 --> 49:56.058
You could... [stutters]

49:56.160 --> 49:57.493
-Like, do it--
-Don't... Don't ask me

49:57.595 --> 49:59.595
to try fry it. Don't.

50:00.898 --> 50:03.265
<i> I've been home from surgery</i>
<i> for a little over two weeks,</i>

50:03.368 --> 50:04.934
<i> and I've been doing okay.</i>

50:05.036 --> 50:06.902
<i> It's just been a bit</i>
<i> of an adjustment</i>

50:07.005 --> 50:08.337
<i> with how little I can eat.</i>

50:08.439 --> 50:10.206
But overall,
I feel a lot better.

50:11.676 --> 50:16.178
<i> I was put on a liquid diet</i>
<i> after surgery for a week.</i>

50:16.280 --> 50:17.346
<i> And that was tough.</i>

50:17.448 --> 50:20.182
<i> And then he put me on</i>
<i> what is called the Stage 2,</i>

50:20.284 --> 50:21.584
<i>which is mainly liquids,</i>

50:21.686 --> 50:23.953
<i> but I could add stuff</i>
<i> like vegetables juice,</i>

50:24.055 --> 50:25.921
<i> or skimmed milk,</i>
<i> and maybe some yogurt.</i>

50:26.024 --> 50:28.124
<i> And I'm supposed to stay</i>
<i> on that for another week.</i>

50:28.226 --> 50:31.527
<i> But after two weeks</i>
<i> of not having anything solid,</i>

50:31.629 --> 50:33.129
<i> I couldn't take it.</i>

50:33.231 --> 50:35.631
<i> And I'm eating a lot</i>
<i> of mashed potatoes lately,</i>

50:35.733 --> 50:38.434
<i> and I know there's not</i>
<i> protein in mashed potatoes,</i>

50:38.536 --> 50:40.403
but it's one of the things
that I could tolerate.

50:45.243 --> 50:48.144
[Amber]<i> Nathan is progressing,</i>

50:48.246 --> 50:51.881
<i> but he is definitely</i>
<i> not eating the right things.</i>

50:51.983 --> 50:54.483
<i> And when I saw him starting</i>
<i> to make the wrong choices,</i>

50:54.585 --> 50:57.520
my whole body was like,
"I hope he throws his guts up

50:57.622 --> 50:58.988
and I hope
it comes out his nose."

50:59.090 --> 51:01.323
<i> Only because he needs</i>
<i> to know what that feels like.</i>

51:02.493 --> 51:04.493
<i> I'm not on liquids.</i>

51:04.595 --> 51:06.729
<i> So I just eat what I eat.</i>
<i> And if it tempts him?</i>

51:06.831 --> 51:10.366
<i> You know, hey, if he's gonna</i>
<i> do it, he's gonna do it,</i>

51:10.468 --> 51:13.169
<i> and he's gonna</i>
<i> have to see for himself.</i>

51:18.076 --> 51:20.009
<i> Amber's told me</i>
<i> I'm making her worried</i>

51:20.111 --> 51:22.244
<i> because of some</i>
<i> of my recent food choices.</i>

51:22.346 --> 51:24.814
<i>I know I'm still losing weight</i>
<i>because my clothes are bigger.</i>

51:24.916 --> 51:27.349
<i> So I'm not concerned</i>
<i> about my progress.</i>

51:27.452 --> 51:29.985
<i> I'm concerned a little</i>
<i> about hers, to be honest.</i>

51:30.088 --> 51:32.054
<i> I've seen her struggle</i>
<i> this past month.</i>

51:32.156 --> 51:35.724
<i> She's made some choices</i>
<i> that aren't a part</i>
<i> of the diet plan.</i>

51:35.827 --> 51:38.394
<i> By next month,</i>
<i> if she doesn't make it</i>
<i> to her weight loss goal,</i>

51:38.496 --> 51:40.062
<i> I'm scared</i>
<i> she won't get the surgery.</i>

51:40.164 --> 51:42.064
<i> And it's important to me</i>
<i> that she does that,</i>

51:42.166 --> 51:44.533
<i> so we're able</i>
<i> to keep doing this together.</i>

51:44.635 --> 51:46.836
-You done?
-I don't know, I think so.

51:48.539 --> 51:50.439
When you had your surgery,
how did you feel like?

51:50.541 --> 51:52.908
What did your body do
when you were like,
"Oh, I'm done"?

51:53.010 --> 51:55.611
For me,
if I even smelt the food,

51:55.713 --> 51:57.947
another bite, like,
I would be sick.

51:58.049 --> 51:59.582
I need to learn
to listen to my body.

51:59.684 --> 52:00.950
I think that's part
of the problem.

52:02.019 --> 52:03.018
Could be.

52:12.063 --> 52:13.562
<i> Amber and I</i>
<i> are back in Houston</i>

52:13.664 --> 52:15.898
<i> to go to our next appointment</i>
<i> with Dr. Now.</i>

52:16.000 --> 52:17.500
<i> And I'm nervous.</i>

52:17.602 --> 52:20.302
<i> Because I don't know</i>
<i> what the scale's gonna show</i>
<i> for either of us.</i>

52:21.205 --> 52:22.371
<i> I know I've been losing</i>

52:22.473 --> 52:23.806
<i> because of</i>
<i> the weight loss surgery</i>

52:23.908 --> 52:26.041
<i>and how little it lets me eat.</i>

52:26.144 --> 52:28.310
<i> And I know</i>
<i> Amber's been working hard.</i>

52:28.412 --> 52:31.547
<i> So I'm just hoping</i>
<i> that we both have</i>
<i> some good progress today.</i>

52:32.583 --> 52:34.150
Nathan and Amber.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.719
[Nathan]<i> At the time</i>
<i> of my surgery, I was at 521,</i>

52:36.821 --> 52:38.888
<i> and Dr. Now told me</i>
<i> I should lose 40 pounds</i>

52:38.990 --> 52:41.423
<i> the first month</i>
<i> after my surgery.</i>

52:41.526 --> 52:42.858
-Me first?
-You first.

52:43.861 --> 52:46.595
[Nathan]<i> So to be on track,</i>
<i>I should be down to 481 today.</i>

52:53.371 --> 52:57.139
<i> I'm a bit speechless,</i>
<i> because I don't see</i>
<i> how I lost so little.</i>

52:57.241 --> 52:59.275
<i> I had known that I've made</i>
<i> some poor choices</i>

52:59.377 --> 53:00.442
before I came in here,

53:00.545 --> 53:02.845
but I didn't realize
it was as bad as it had been.

53:03.781 --> 53:05.848
[Amber]<i> I had a feeling</i>
<i> this was gonna happen.</i>

53:05.950 --> 53:08.951
<i> I tried to tell him,</i>
<i> but all I could do</i>
<i> is control me.</i>

53:12.590 --> 53:15.090
<i>At my last appointment,</i>
<i> I was at 502.</i>

53:15.193 --> 53:17.426
<i> And Dr. Now</i>
<i> told me to lose 50 pounds</i>

53:17.528 --> 53:20.262
<i> in order to get approved</i>
<i> for my revision.</i>

53:20.364 --> 53:22.765
<i> So that means</i>
<i> I have to be at 452 today.</i>

53:28.372 --> 53:30.839
<i> That's disappointing,</i>
<i> to say the least.</i>

53:30.942 --> 53:32.641
<i> I am not happy about that.</i>

53:33.411 --> 53:35.844
[Nathan]<i> I don't think</i>
<i>today's gonna go like I hoped.</i>

53:35.947 --> 53:39.281
<i> So that's disappointing,</i>
<i> but we both have no one</i>
<i> to blame but ourselves.</i>

53:46.324 --> 53:49.858
<i> So we just need</i>
<i> to take responsibility.</i>

53:49.961 --> 53:52.461
<i> And work to fix it</i>
<i> because that's all</i>
<i> we can do right now.</i>

53:58.803 --> 54:02.671
-Hello, how are you
all doing?
-[both] Good.

54:02.773 --> 54:06.208
All right, let's see
what we got
with your own progress.

54:06.310 --> 54:08.644
With Nathan,
starting with you.

54:08.746 --> 54:11.146
This is about a month
after surgery.

54:11.682 --> 54:13.916
And you have lost...

54:14.752 --> 54:17.086
the whole six pounds
instead of 40.

54:17.188 --> 54:19.388
So what's going on that
you only lost six pounds

54:19.490 --> 54:21.490
in one month
after weight loss surgery?

54:21.592 --> 54:24.326
I... Honestly, the only thing
I can think of is that

54:24.428 --> 54:28.063
I've... probably eaten stuff
that I shouldn't have.

54:28.165 --> 54:30.566
-Like what?
-Um... [clicks tongue]

54:30.668 --> 54:33.669
[chuckles] I had
mashed potatoes.

54:33.771 --> 54:36.272
I've had
macaroni and cheese.

54:37.308 --> 54:39.241
And so you're in
the Stage 2 of diet,

54:39.343 --> 54:41.377
which is an only-liquid diet.

54:41.479 --> 54:43.846
But you're eating
mashed potato,
and macaroni and cheese.

54:43.948 --> 54:45.447
-Mmmhmm.
-So which part of that

54:45.549 --> 54:47.750
is making sense to you?

54:47.852 --> 54:49.852
-None of it.
-Were you hungry?

54:49.954 --> 54:51.520
Yeah, I was.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.522
I guarantee that's not
the physical hunger.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.291
That's a psychological hunger.

54:55.393 --> 54:58.594
So in one month after surgery,
losing six pounds.

54:58.696 --> 55:01.297
That mean next month,
you're gonna start
gaining weight.

55:01.399 --> 55:02.765
That's not gonna
happen, but--

55:02.867 --> 55:04.533
Let me put something to you.

55:04.635 --> 55:07.970
You just had an operation
that take away
your physical hunger

55:08.072 --> 55:10.139
and prevents you
from overeating.

55:10.241 --> 55:11.707
And you hardly lost anything,

55:11.809 --> 55:14.476
so that is exactly
what's gonna happen.

55:14.578 --> 55:16.745
And you're not seeing
the reality of that.

55:16.847 --> 55:18.013
Right.

55:18.115 --> 55:20.382
You're going through
all these things,
and you work hard

55:20.484 --> 55:22.985
and got a second chance
to get your life back,

55:23.087 --> 55:24.586
but now you throw it away

55:24.689 --> 55:26.822
and going back to killing
yourself with food.

55:26.924 --> 55:28.624
What are we gonna do
to change that?

55:28.726 --> 55:31.327
Uh, not make those choices
anymore? Work harder?

55:31.429 --> 55:35.230
Why should I believe
you're gonna follow through
this time?

55:35.333 --> 55:37.733
I feel like I let
a lot of people down, and...

55:37.835 --> 55:40.302
I don't like feeling that way.

55:40.404 --> 55:42.338
So... in order for me
not to feel that way anymore,

55:42.440 --> 55:44.773
I'm gonna have to do exactly
what I'm supposed to do

55:44.875 --> 55:47.009
and continue
to get better at it.

55:47.111 --> 55:50.312
Okay. But this isn't
all dependent on you, though.

55:50.414 --> 55:52.481
Because you both
have to do this

55:52.583 --> 55:54.683
and support each other.
Okay?

55:54.785 --> 55:56.985
Then let's change the gear.

55:57.088 --> 56:00.022
-Amber.
-I did horrible, sir.
Horrible.

56:00.124 --> 56:01.657
Wait a minute. You,

56:01.759 --> 56:03.625
instead of losing weight...
We give you all the tools.

56:03.728 --> 56:06.295
You already had
one weight loss surgery.

56:06.397 --> 56:09.331
-And you gained three pounds.
-Yes.

56:09.433 --> 56:11.600
So what is going on
in this household?

56:11.702 --> 56:15.070
So, [sighs] for me, I...

56:16.273 --> 56:19.007
panicked. And I literally...

56:19.110 --> 56:22.044
did not get out of bed.
I didn't...

56:22.146 --> 56:24.780
count my calories
or anything for two weeks,

56:24.882 --> 56:27.483
which is...
The proof is right there.

56:27.585 --> 56:29.218
I just gave up,

56:29.320 --> 56:31.220
and I should not have
done that at all.

56:31.322 --> 56:33.856
None of this stuff
you saying make any sense.

56:33.958 --> 56:36.191
And, ultimately,
there is no excuse

56:36.293 --> 56:38.460
that justifies being unhealthy

56:38.562 --> 56:41.397
to the point you're killing
yourself like this.

56:41.499 --> 56:43.899
So nothing
and no event in your life

56:44.001 --> 56:45.701
justify overeating.

56:45.803 --> 56:48.036
But you're justifying
to yourself.

56:48.139 --> 56:49.805
So you're convincing yourself,

56:49.907 --> 56:52.241
"It's okay to overeat
because of this issue."

56:52.343 --> 56:53.976
But this issue is not reality.

56:54.078 --> 56:57.212
The bigger issue
I'm concerned about is that

56:57.314 --> 57:00.416
it's clear that there's
something going on
in the household

57:00.518 --> 57:03.352
that both of you encouraging
each other to overeat.

57:03.454 --> 57:06.555
I don't see how you all
gonna change that environment

57:06.657 --> 57:10.125
that you have built over years
for pathological eating.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.194
Well, I know I can do it.

57:12.296 --> 57:14.029
I haven't, but I know I can.

57:14.131 --> 57:16.698
Well, you know, I know
I can go to moon, too.

57:16.801 --> 57:18.000
[chuckles]

57:18.102 --> 57:20.035
But what is the practical
reality of that?

57:20.137 --> 57:21.370
That's gonna happen?

57:21.472 --> 57:22.838
-Yeah, I can go.
-[Nathan] Right.

57:22.940 --> 57:25.107
If you give me a rocket,
I will go.

57:25.209 --> 57:27.609
But that's gonna be reality?
No, it's not.

57:27.711 --> 57:31.280
And a figure of speech
isn't gonna change anything.

57:31.382 --> 57:33.615
I know. Talk is cheap.

57:33.717 --> 57:36.418
You know, I can tell you
whatever I wanna tell you
here, but until I do it,

57:36.520 --> 57:38.287
you're... Nobody's gonna
believe it.

57:38.389 --> 57:42.124
Okay. Amber,
what's the solution for you?

57:42.226 --> 57:45.294
I just have to get back at it
and prove to you that...

57:45.396 --> 57:47.296
That I was on the right track
to begin with

57:47.398 --> 57:49.565
and that I'm not gonna
fail you again.

57:49.667 --> 57:52.100
Well, I can't believe
any word you're saying

57:52.203 --> 57:53.735
-or Nathan's saying...
-[Amber] Mmmhmm.

57:53.838 --> 57:54.903
...until I see some action.

57:55.005 --> 57:55.804
Right.

57:55.906 --> 57:57.039
-Understood.
-Okay?

57:57.141 --> 58:00.108
And, Nathan, you went off
the rail quicker after surgery

58:00.211 --> 58:02.544
than anybody I have ever seen.

58:02.646 --> 58:03.879
So, at this point,

58:03.981 --> 58:06.615
I'm disappointed
for both of you,

58:06.717 --> 58:08.884
so I'm gonna give you both
two months

58:08.986 --> 58:10.819
to get back on track, okay?

58:10.921 --> 58:13.789
Which means that
from here on out, Nathan,

58:13.891 --> 58:15.824
you lose at least
20 pounds a month.

58:15.926 --> 58:18.794
And for you, Amber,
you should be able to lose

58:18.896 --> 58:21.163
the 50-pound goal I gave you.

58:21.265 --> 58:23.332
If I don't see that progress,

58:23.434 --> 58:24.900
I know nothing else
is gonna work.

58:25.002 --> 58:27.569
-Yes, sir.
-All right? So...

58:27.671 --> 58:29.738
Uh, you know,
this is your life,

58:29.840 --> 58:33.242
and the only wealth
in this world you got
is your health.

58:33.344 --> 58:36.411
And you're throwing it away
by overeating

58:36.514 --> 58:38.680
and killing yourself
on the food

58:38.782 --> 58:42.317
and making excuses
that are acceptable
to yourself,

58:42.419 --> 58:43.986
not to anybody else.

58:44.088 --> 58:47.656
So it's totally up to you both
to make the changes

58:47.758 --> 58:49.791
and change your life around
before it's too late.

58:49.894 --> 58:51.960
If you keep this up,
I guarantee you

58:52.062 --> 58:54.897
neither of you will be
here five years from now.

58:58.035 --> 59:00.002
And this is the easy choice,

59:00.104 --> 59:02.538
in that you have to see
the reality of it.

59:02.640 --> 59:06.041
-Okay? I'm gonna set you up
both to see a therapist.
-Yes, sir.

59:06.143 --> 59:07.142
-Okay?
-[Nathan] Yes, sir.

59:07.244 --> 59:09.545
Because maybe they'll
be able to help you all

59:09.647 --> 59:12.214
on your negative dynamic.
Okay?

59:12.316 --> 59:14.950
-Are we clear
about what's going on?
-[both] Yes, sir.

59:15.052 --> 59:16.785
Okay, we'll set that up.

59:16.887 --> 59:19.721
And both of you need to do
everything you can

59:19.823 --> 59:21.189
to get on track now.

59:21.292 --> 59:22.391
Yes, sir.

59:22.493 --> 59:24.493
In the meantime, if you need
anything, give me a call.

59:24.595 --> 59:25.894
-[both] Yes, sir.
-All right.

59:25.996 --> 59:27.596
-[Amber] Thank you.
-[Dr. Now] Mmmhmm.

59:29.166 --> 59:32.834
We have a very
unfortunate situation
with Nathan and Amber.

59:32.937 --> 59:35.370
<i> For Nathan,</i>
<i> I've never seen someone</i>

59:35.472 --> 59:38.006
work against weight loss
surgery like he has,

59:38.108 --> 59:40.409
<i> especially in such</i>
<i> a dangerous way</i>

59:40.511 --> 59:42.144
so soon after the operation.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.512
<i>Because at this point,</i>

59:43.614 --> 59:46.481
there is not only no
physical drive to eat for him,

59:46.584 --> 59:48.650
<i> but it is actually</i>
<i> a painful process</i>

59:48.752 --> 59:50.519
<i> to try to eat solid food</i>

59:50.621 --> 59:52.054
that soon after surgery.

59:52.156 --> 59:54.556
<i> So there are deeper issues</i>
<i> at play here.</i>

59:54.658 --> 59:56.425
And I think Amber's influence

59:56.527 --> 59:59.261
<i> on both her and Nathan's</i>
<i> eating habits</i>

59:59.363 --> 1:00:02.831
is much greater than they both
realize and she admits.

1:00:02.933 --> 1:00:04.866
<i>Because I'm starting to think</i>

1:00:04.969 --> 1:00:07.769
<i> she may primarily be</i>
<i> a negative influence</i>

1:00:07.871 --> 1:00:09.504
on their unhealthy habits.

1:00:09.607 --> 1:00:11.940
<i> But she seems to blame</i>
<i> Nathan for all that.</i>

1:00:12.042 --> 1:00:14.076
And Nathan seems
to accept that.

1:00:14.178 --> 1:00:16.578
<i> So the dynamic</i>
<i> between them</i>

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.381
<i> is looking like</i>
<i> it is a more intricate issue</i>

1:00:19.483 --> 1:00:22.250
that is going to be
more difficult to address.

1:00:22.353 --> 1:00:24.786
<i> Hopefully, therapy</i>
<i> will help with that</i>

1:00:24.888 --> 1:00:27.756
<i> because they both</i>
<i>are in a very dangerous place,</i>

1:00:27.858 --> 1:00:29.858
where they are about
to self-destruct

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.227
<i> unless they turn things</i>
<i> around now.</i>

1:00:32.329 --> 1:00:34.096
<i> And if they don't do</i>
<i> that immediately,</i>

1:00:34.198 --> 1:00:36.765
then I don't think there'll
be anything we can do

1:00:36.867 --> 1:00:39.434
to stop them both
from going right back

1:00:39.536 --> 1:00:40.969
<i>to the same situation</i>

1:00:41.071 --> 1:00:43.905
and an unhealthy dynamic
they have had for years.

1:00:44.008 --> 1:00:46.908
<i> So this is a very dark</i>
<i> situation with them</i>

1:00:47.011 --> 1:00:50.245
that we will, hopefully, help
to turn around right now

1:00:50.347 --> 1:00:51.580
before it's too late.

1:01:04.595 --> 1:01:06.595
[Nathan]
<i> Amber and I are headed</i>
<i> to the couples therapy</i>

1:01:06.697 --> 1:01:08.563
<i> that Dr. Now wanted us</i>
<i> to go to.</i>

1:01:09.066 --> 1:01:09.965
[door squeaking]

1:01:10.067 --> 1:01:11.967
Hi, folks. I'm Dr. Paradise.
Come on in.

1:01:12.069 --> 1:01:13.635
[Amber] Hi, nice to meet you.

1:01:13.737 --> 1:01:16.271
[Nathan]<i> And if there's</i>
<i> something that will help us,</i>
<i> I'm ready to do it.</i>

1:01:17.241 --> 1:01:18.573
Thank you.

1:01:18.676 --> 1:01:20.742
<i> But it's definitely</i>
<i> a little scary.</i>

1:01:20.844 --> 1:01:23.078
-Okay.
-Welcome.

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:25.814
Glad to see you guys.
How'd you guys meet?

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:30.018
Her cousin was in my drama
program, introduced us.

1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:31.987
Our first date
was at her house.

1:01:32.089 --> 1:01:33.488
She cooked me
one of my favorite meals.

1:01:33.590 --> 1:01:35.590
And rest is history.

1:01:35.693 --> 1:01:37.826
So food... Food was
from the very beginning.

1:01:37.928 --> 1:01:39.361
You guys are both already big.

1:01:39.463 --> 1:01:41.363
You... You won him over
with dinner.

1:01:41.465 --> 1:01:42.798
I guess so. [laughs]

1:01:42.900 --> 1:01:44.299
What made you attracted
to each other?

1:01:44.401 --> 1:01:46.068
I... I think she's strong.

1:01:47.071 --> 1:01:49.805
The strength that I wish
I had, I... I see in her.

1:01:49.907 --> 1:01:50.839
What did you see in him?

1:01:50.941 --> 1:01:53.542
He's very levelheaded,
very grounded,

1:01:53.644 --> 1:01:55.610
um, and very spirit oriented,

1:01:55.713 --> 1:01:58.313
which was something that
I felt like I had to have

1:01:58.415 --> 1:02:00.716
'cause I was in a very,
very toxic relationship

1:02:00.818 --> 1:02:02.217
for a very long time.

1:02:02.319 --> 1:02:04.853
-So you were counting
on him to be a good guy.
-Yeah.

1:02:04.955 --> 1:02:07.422
Um, tell me about
your physical relationship.

1:02:08.592 --> 1:02:11.059
Uh, right now,
it's nonexistent.

1:02:11.161 --> 1:02:12.294
How was it at the beginning?

1:02:12.996 --> 1:02:15.130
Well, I've always been big.

1:02:15.232 --> 1:02:18.300
-And, like, right now,
I have a lymphedema growth...
-[Dr. Paradise] Okay.

1:02:18.402 --> 1:02:20.168
...that sits
right on my abdomen

1:02:20.270 --> 1:02:22.003
-right above that area.
-Okay.

1:02:22.106 --> 1:02:23.839
So there's no way
it's possible.

1:02:23.941 --> 1:02:24.973
-Blocked off.
-Yep.

1:02:25.075 --> 1:02:26.208
You know, when we married,

1:02:26.310 --> 1:02:31.146
everything that we attempted
just didn't physically work.

1:02:31.749 --> 1:02:34.583
Okay. So you seem
resigned to it.

1:02:34.685 --> 1:02:36.885
It's just not at the top
of our priority list.

1:02:36.987 --> 1:02:38.420
It never really has been.

1:02:38.522 --> 1:02:41.857
-Is that okay with...
With you?
-Not really.

1:02:41.959 --> 1:02:45.393
Okay. I'm worried, Amber,
that you seem pretty shut off

1:02:45.496 --> 1:02:47.562
from that part
of a relationship

1:02:47.664 --> 1:02:49.064
Yeah, I... I am.

1:02:49.166 --> 1:02:50.866
And, you know... [stammers]
It certainly my intent

1:02:50.968 --> 1:02:52.567
when you guys came in
was not to do,

1:02:52.669 --> 1:02:54.069
like, Dr. Ruth with you guys.

1:02:54.171 --> 1:02:56.238
But in most relationships,

1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:58.507
it's often the elephant
in the room.

1:02:58.609 --> 1:03:01.910
Somebody's not getting
what they want in the bedroom.

1:03:02.012 --> 1:03:05.113
And that will cause
ripples of conflict.

1:03:05.215 --> 1:03:07.682
Uh, I think neither
one of us are getting
what we want there.

1:03:07.785 --> 1:03:08.717
What happened?

1:03:08.819 --> 1:03:10.452
Where... Where did it go
off the rail?

1:03:10.554 --> 1:03:13.021
I think I know
one of the... The things.

1:03:13.123 --> 1:03:15.457
Uh, before this whole
experience with Dr. Now,

1:03:15.559 --> 1:03:16.958
I was supposed
to have the surgery.

1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:19.261
-I was losing the weight.
I was doing great.
-Yep.

1:03:19.363 --> 1:03:22.697
And then the doctor
cancelled the surgery

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:25.467
because I didn't have
the $2,000 payment.

1:03:25.569 --> 1:03:27.803
-His... His copay, yeah.
-Ya didn't have the money.
Okay. Mmmhmm.

1:03:27.905 --> 1:03:29.938
I... I basically
just got depressed,

1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:31.373
and it got hard to do things.

1:03:31.475 --> 1:03:34.376
-And I didn't wanna do a lot.
-And your self-esteem...

1:03:34.478 --> 1:03:35.911
Weight goes up,
self-esteem goes down.

1:03:36.013 --> 1:03:37.279
Mmmhmm.

1:03:37.381 --> 1:03:39.214
And that's not attractive
to you, is it?

1:03:39.650 --> 1:03:40.782
No.

1:03:40.884 --> 1:03:43.819
She called me disgusting,
a bad husband, all that stuff

1:03:43.921 --> 1:03:46.655
because I gave up
and went back to food.

1:03:46.757 --> 1:03:48.023
Does she respect you?

1:03:52.996 --> 1:03:54.396
[Amber] No. Probably not.

1:03:54.731 --> 1:03:55.564
Wow!

1:03:55.666 --> 1:03:56.932
I... I didn't want
to answer that

1:03:57.034 --> 1:03:58.233
'cause I didn't want
to upset her.

1:03:58.335 --> 1:04:01.603
No, probably not.
Not, not... No. No.

1:04:02.539 --> 1:04:04.739
I just want her
to be proud of me.

1:04:04.842 --> 1:04:06.508
Why should
she be proud of you?

1:04:10.681 --> 1:04:14.950
So, Nathan,
you're a great guy!

1:04:15.052 --> 1:04:17.786
But I haven't seen you
stick up for yourself.

1:04:17.888 --> 1:04:19.788
If you don't stick up
for yourself,

1:04:19.890 --> 1:04:22.490
it's hard for people,
even your wife,

1:04:22.593 --> 1:04:23.658
to respect you.

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:26.127
And so we gotta get
you stickin' up for yourself.

1:04:26.230 --> 1:04:29.197
And that may involve
sticking up to her.

1:04:29.299 --> 1:04:31.600
Is she helping you
lose weight?

1:04:31.702 --> 1:04:33.001
I would say she is.

1:04:33.103 --> 1:04:35.170
'Cause sometimes
a partner will undermine
somebody's weight loss.

1:04:35.272 --> 1:04:38.373
No, I need her
to be more forceful
when it comes to that.

1:04:38.475 --> 1:04:39.608
-But I'm not gonna do that.
-You don't...

1:04:39.710 --> 1:04:40.809
You don't need her
to do anything.

1:04:40.911 --> 1:04:42.611
You gotta leave her out of it.

1:04:42.713 --> 1:04:44.012
Start advocating for yourself.

1:04:44.114 --> 1:04:45.947
It's gonna make her
respect you more.

1:04:46.049 --> 1:04:49.451
And the number one thing
you can do for yourself now
is what?

1:04:50.821 --> 1:04:53.321
-Lose the weight!
-Oh, okay.

1:04:53.423 --> 1:04:57.492
So in service of this idea
of... Of being independent,

1:04:57.594 --> 1:05:01.329
I wonder if you guys could
actually plan separate meals.

1:05:01.431 --> 1:05:03.698
Plan separate shopping trips.

1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:04.900
How does that sound to you?

1:05:05.936 --> 1:05:06.968
It worries me

1:05:07.070 --> 1:05:08.536
because that's
one of the only things

1:05:08.639 --> 1:05:09.738
that we do together.

1:05:11.108 --> 1:05:13.074
Your most unhealthy habit

1:05:13.176 --> 1:05:15.377
is the thing that links
you guys together.

1:05:15.479 --> 1:05:16.311
[Nathan] Mmmhmm.

1:05:17.581 --> 1:05:20.215
So I need you to...
To break it apart.

1:05:20.317 --> 1:05:21.850
I need you to eat by yourself.

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:25.420
And you're gonna have to find
something else to bond with.

1:05:29.326 --> 1:05:30.292
Work for you?

1:05:31.161 --> 1:05:33.194
Okay, thank you for comin'.

1:05:33.297 --> 1:05:34.729
Thank you. Got it?

1:05:34.831 --> 1:05:36.531
<i> Nathan's a really</i>
<i> articulate guy,</i>

1:05:36.633 --> 1:05:38.733
and I'm impressed
with what he has to say.

1:05:38.835 --> 1:05:42.704
I'm worried that the more
he tries to get Amber
to like him,

1:05:42.806 --> 1:05:44.940
<i>the less she really likes him.</i>

1:05:45.042 --> 1:05:47.075
There's something
in their relationship

1:05:47.177 --> 1:05:49.177
that's incapacitating him

1:05:49.279 --> 1:05:50.946
in terms of sticking up
for himself

1:05:51.048 --> 1:05:52.914
and even just feeling good
about himself,

1:05:53.016 --> 1:05:54.916
feeling like he's worth
sticking up for.

1:05:55.018 --> 1:05:57.018
[Nathan]<i> There were</i>
<i> a couple of things</i>
<i> in the appointment</i>

1:05:57.120 --> 1:05:58.186
<i> that were new to me.</i>

1:05:58.288 --> 1:06:00.455
<i> The main thing that was new</i>
<i> to me was the idea</i>

1:06:00.557 --> 1:06:02.257
<i> that Amber didn't respect me.</i>

1:06:02.359 --> 1:06:05.126
<i> I... I mean, I've always,</i>
<i> to some degree, felt it,</i>

1:06:05.228 --> 1:06:09.197
<i> but that's the first time</i>
<i> it was said out loud</i>
<i> and put into words.</i>

1:06:09.299 --> 1:06:12.300
<i> I guess I'm a traditionalist</i>
<i> in some sort of the sense</i>

1:06:12.402 --> 1:06:13.535
<i> when it comes to marriage.</i>

1:06:13.637 --> 1:06:15.937
<i> I feel like we should want</i>
<i> to do everything together.</i>

1:06:16.039 --> 1:06:17.973
<i> It just makes me feel like</i>

1:06:18.075 --> 1:06:20.075
<i> I'm drifting further away</i>
<i> from Amber.</i>

1:06:27.384 --> 1:06:28.783
How fast do you want me to go?

1:06:28.885 --> 1:06:31.086
Just go whatever's com...
1 mile per hour, 1.5.

1:06:31.188 --> 1:06:32.087
Whatever you feel.

1:06:32.189 --> 1:06:33.822
Just two or three minutes,
get ya movin'.

1:06:33.924 --> 1:06:35.156
[Nathan]<i> It's been a few weeks</i>

1:06:35.258 --> 1:06:37.392
<i> since we've had</i>
<i> our appointment</i>
<i> with Dr. Paradise.</i>

1:06:37.494 --> 1:06:39.828
<i> And since then Amber and I</i>
<i> have been focusing</i>

1:06:39.930 --> 1:06:41.629
<i> on the things</i>
<i> that he told us to do.</i>

1:06:41.732 --> 1:06:42.931
Here's your
stretching pull, man.

1:06:43.033 --> 1:06:44.132
[Nathan]<i> It's been</i>
<i> an adjustment,</i>

1:06:44.234 --> 1:06:46.001
<i> and I'm still working on it.</i>

1:06:46.103 --> 1:06:48.269
<i> But I will say</i>
<i> I've been proud of myself</i>

1:06:48.372 --> 1:06:50.438
<i> for how much I've been</i>
<i> doing on my own</i>

1:06:50.540 --> 1:06:52.173
<i> and how well I'm doing at it.</i>

1:06:52.275 --> 1:06:53.441
-Feeling pretty good?
-Yeah.

1:06:53.543 --> 1:06:54.676
All right.

1:06:54.778 --> 1:06:57.345
[Nathan]<i> But I joined a gym,</i>
<i> and I got a trainer</i>

1:06:57.447 --> 1:07:00.782
<i> so I can push myself</i>
<i> to do even more</i>
<i> with my exercises.</i>

1:07:02.352 --> 1:07:04.986
<i> But at the same time,</i>
<i> when I'm here</i>
<i> and I hit a new goal,</i>

1:07:05.088 --> 1:07:07.088
<i> what I wanna do</i>
<i> is turn and tell Amber.</i>

1:07:08.058 --> 1:07:09.657
<i> And then I wish she was here.</i>

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:10.792
Two more time.

1:07:10.894 --> 1:07:12.927
[Nathan]<i> And I'm working</i>
<i> to see myself as someone</i>

1:07:13.030 --> 1:07:15.096
<i> who isn't dependent</i>
<i> on anyone else</i>

1:07:15.198 --> 1:07:17.966
<i> because I know Amber</i>
<i> isn't going to respect me</i>

1:07:18.068 --> 1:07:19.367
<i> until I can respect myself.</i>

1:07:19.469 --> 1:07:21.836
<i> I'm trying to change my life,</i>
<i> and I'm trying to get better.</i>

1:07:21.938 --> 1:07:24.305
<i> And I'm trusting that</i>
<i> it's gonna be for the best.</i>

1:07:24.408 --> 1:07:25.206
<i> But it's scary...</i>

1:07:25.308 --> 1:07:26.674
One more time. Come on!

1:07:26.777 --> 1:07:28.009
-[effort grunts]
-That's it!

1:07:28.111 --> 1:07:30.378
<i> ...because it feels like</i>
<i> I'm losing Amber right now.</i>

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:31.546
Good job, man.

1:07:31.648 --> 1:07:32.547
-Thank you.
-Proud of you.

1:07:53.003 --> 1:07:55.303
[Nathan]<i> I'm in Houston</i>
<i> for the appointment</i>
<i> with Dr. Now.</i>

1:07:55.405 --> 1:07:58.006
<i> Amber couldn't make it today</i>
<i> because she had to work.</i>

1:07:58.909 --> 1:08:01.109
<i> She got a new job</i>
<i> this past month.</i>

1:08:02.012 --> 1:08:04.879
<i> And she wasn't expecting</i>
<i> to have to work today.</i>

1:08:04.981 --> 1:08:07.048
<i> So she thought</i>
<i> she was gonna be free today.</i>

1:08:07.150 --> 1:08:08.883
<i> But I know</i>
<i> that he's gonna think</i>

1:08:08.985 --> 1:08:11.352
<i>that she's trying to avoid him</i>
<i> or avoid the scale.</i>

1:08:11.455 --> 1:08:13.421
<i>But that's not what's going on</i>

1:08:13.523 --> 1:08:15.457
<i> because this is</i>
<i> important to her.</i>

1:08:18.195 --> 1:08:19.194
Nathan.

1:08:20.197 --> 1:08:21.362
[grunts]

1:08:23.667 --> 1:08:24.866
-[Nathan] Hello.
-Hello.

1:08:26.837 --> 1:08:29.671
-[Nathan] How are you?
-I'm okay.

1:08:29.773 --> 1:08:32.507
[Nathan]
<i> At the last appointment,</i>
<i> two months ago, I was at 515,</i>

1:08:32.609 --> 1:08:34.542
<i> and Dr. Now says</i>
<i> I should be losing</i>

1:08:34.644 --> 1:08:36.611
<i> at least 20 pounds a month.</i>

1:08:36.713 --> 1:08:39.547
We're gonna weigh you, okay?
Let me just zero it out.

1:08:42.319 --> 1:08:43.952
Okay, step up on the scale.

1:08:44.054 --> 1:08:47.589
[Nathan]<i> That means I need to</i>
<i> have lost 40 pounds by today</i>

1:08:47.691 --> 1:08:49.157
<i> to be under 475.</i>

1:08:54.698 --> 1:08:57.132
<i> So I'm hoping that's</i>
<i> the number I made it down to.</i>

1:09:02.506 --> 1:09:04.405
-We're gonna
be going to Room 5 please.
-Yes, ma'am.

1:09:08.678 --> 1:09:10.979
[Nathan]
<i> Well, it's a lot better</i>
<i>than just six pounds the last,</i>

1:09:11.081 --> 1:09:12.413
<i> so I'm happy about that.</i>

1:09:13.250 --> 1:09:16.117
<i> But I'm not sure how Dr. Now</i>
<i> will feel about it.</i>

1:09:16.219 --> 1:09:18.052
<i> Hopefully, he sees</i>
<i> the positive.</i>

1:09:18.155 --> 1:09:19.154
<i> But we'll see.</i>

1:09:24.561 --> 1:09:26.461
Hi, Nathan,
how you doing today?

1:09:26.563 --> 1:09:27.762
I'm good. How are you doin'?

1:09:28.431 --> 1:09:31.132
Good. So where is Amber today?

1:09:31.234 --> 1:09:33.401
She couldn't make it
because of work.

1:09:33.503 --> 1:09:36.137
But this appointment
has been scheduled
for a while now.

1:09:36.239 --> 1:09:38.406
And she knew that
if she needed to be free.

1:09:38.508 --> 1:09:41.142
She could easily have been
available to be here

1:09:41.244 --> 1:09:42.177
if she wanted to.

1:09:42.279 --> 1:09:44.479
Or she could have called
to reschedule.

1:09:44.581 --> 1:09:47.515
So I think the issue is
she didn't wanna come today.

1:09:47.617 --> 1:09:48.950
So why that?

1:09:49.052 --> 1:09:51.819
I... I think she might
have been a little nervous
about her weight

1:09:51.922 --> 1:09:53.154
and seeing how she was doing.

1:09:53.256 --> 1:09:55.790
Is she making the changes
that she needs?

1:09:55.892 --> 1:09:59.694
Some. She's struggling, uh,
but we both are.

1:09:59.796 --> 1:10:01.362
Well, you came here today,

1:10:01.464 --> 1:10:03.264
and you're making
some progress.

1:10:03.366 --> 1:10:06.668
You lost, uh, 28 pounds.

1:10:06.770 --> 1:10:10.305
So it looks like you're losing
about 14 pounds a month,

1:10:10.407 --> 1:10:13.508
which is closer
to what you should be losing

1:10:13.610 --> 1:10:16.277
two, three months
after weight loss surgery.

1:10:16.379 --> 1:10:17.946
But you still have
a little ways to go

1:10:18.048 --> 1:10:21.216
to be losing 20 pounds a month
like you should be.

1:10:21.318 --> 1:10:23.985
Nathan, do you think
that therapy's helping?

1:10:24.087 --> 1:10:26.487
Uh, it was hard, um,
but it was really good.

1:10:26.590 --> 1:10:30.058
It made us really look
at how we are as a couple

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:31.459
and work on that.

1:10:31.561 --> 1:10:33.194
So you're gonna continue that?

1:10:33.296 --> 1:10:36.030
Uh, yes, I'm gonna have
an appointment pretty soon

1:10:36.132 --> 1:10:37.632
to continue working on that.

1:10:37.734 --> 1:10:38.700
Good.

1:10:38.802 --> 1:10:41.169
But Amber shouldn't skip
that appointment either.

1:10:41.271 --> 1:10:43.071
You know, Amber is gonna
be here next time.

1:10:43.173 --> 1:10:45.873
All right, no more excuses
that she couldn't make it.

1:10:45.976 --> 1:10:47.375
I know that
she wants to do this.

1:10:47.477 --> 1:10:48.509
She'll be here next time.

1:10:48.612 --> 1:10:51.145
We're...
We're both in this 100%.

1:10:51.781 --> 1:10:53.181
Okay, keep up the good work,

1:10:53.283 --> 1:10:54.849
and I will see you
in two months.

1:10:54.951 --> 1:10:57.885
And if you need anything
before that, give me a call.

1:10:57.988 --> 1:10:59.254
Yes, sir, will do.

1:10:59.356 --> 1:11:01.456
-All right, I'll see you then.
-Yes, sir.

1:11:07.364 --> 1:11:10.732
[Dr. Now]<i> I'm happy</i>
<i> to see that Nathan</i>
<i> has improved his progress</i>

1:11:10.834 --> 1:11:13.234
<i> and that he's moving</i>
<i> in a positive direction.</i>

1:11:13.336 --> 1:11:17.071
That shows he's taking
some responsibility
for himself

1:11:17.173 --> 1:11:19.240
<i> to seek to the changes</i>
<i> he needs.</i>

1:11:19.342 --> 1:11:22.710
<i> But I'm obviously concerned</i>
<i> about Amber right now</i>

1:11:22.812 --> 1:11:24.445
<i> because there was</i>
<i> no good reason</i>

1:11:24.547 --> 1:11:27.248
<i> for her to have missed</i>
<i> the appointment today.</i>

1:11:27.350 --> 1:11:30.418
<i> Because if they both</i>
<i> don't do what they need</i>

1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:31.719
<i> to change their life,</i>

1:11:31.821 --> 1:11:33.788
<i> then it won't be likely</i>
<i> that either of them</i>

1:11:33.890 --> 1:11:35.189
<i> will be able to do this</i>

1:11:35.292 --> 1:11:36.924
for the long term.

1:11:37.027 --> 1:11:39.761
<i> So the next appointment</i>
<i> will be important,</i>

1:11:39.863 --> 1:11:42.096
<i> because that will be</i>
<i> a crossroad for Amber</i>

1:11:42.198 --> 1:11:44.399
<i> that will determine</i>
<i> things for her,</i>

1:11:44.501 --> 1:11:45.633
as well as Nathan.

1:11:49.673 --> 1:11:52.373
[Nathan]<i> Thankfully, Dr. Now</i>
<i> is happy with my progress.</i>

1:11:52.475 --> 1:11:54.242
<i> But I know I have some</i>
<i> more ground to make up,</i>

1:11:54.344 --> 1:11:55.943
<i> so my focus is going to be</i>

1:11:56.046 --> 1:11:58.980
<i> on getting up to the 20 pounds</i>
<i> a month weight loss goal.</i>

1:11:59.082 --> 1:12:00.581
<i> He was suspicious about Amber</i>

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:02.717
<i> not being here</i>
<i> like I thought he'd be.</i>

1:12:02.819 --> 1:12:04.419
<i> But I know that</i>
<i> we are both committed</i>

1:12:04.521 --> 1:12:07.255
<i> to doing what we need to do</i>
<i> in order to get healthy.</i>

1:12:07.357 --> 1:12:10.458
<i> And thankfully, Dr. Now just</i>
<i> kept the same goal for her.</i>

1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:12.093
<i> And I know she'll be happy</i>
<i> about that.</i>

1:12:12.195 --> 1:12:14.462
<i> And I'm confident</i>
<i> that by next time,</i>

1:12:14.564 --> 1:12:16.731
<i> we are both going to be</i>
<i> where we need to be.</i>

1:12:18.001 --> 1:12:20.301
<i> Because I know we're giving</i>
<i> everything we can</i>

1:12:20.403 --> 1:12:22.570
<i> to make sure we can both</i>
<i> keep moving forward.</i>

1:12:42.726 --> 1:12:44.492
[Nathan]<i> Amber and I</i>
<i> are back at Dr. Now's</i>

1:12:44.594 --> 1:12:45.860
<i> for our next appointment.</i>

1:12:48.198 --> 1:12:50.098
<i> And we're both</i>
<i> a little nervous,</i>

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.967
<i> but we're both expecting</i>
<i> to see progress today.</i>

1:12:54.537 --> 1:12:56.170
<i> I've been trusting that</i>
<i> all we are doing</i>

1:12:56.272 --> 1:12:58.606
<i> is going to move us</i>
<i> in the right direction.</i>

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:01.342
<i> Even when I feel like</i>
<i> it's not.</i>

1:13:01.444 --> 1:13:04.545
<i> So I'm hoping that</i>
<i> trust and faith</i>
<i> pays off for us today.</i>

1:13:06.950 --> 1:13:10.118
[Amber]<i> I know I have a lot</i>
<i> to prove to Dr. Now today,</i>

1:13:10.220 --> 1:13:12.754
<i> and that's helped motivate me</i>
<i> to stay on track.</i>

1:13:14.124 --> 1:13:15.590
Amber and Nathan.

1:13:17.494 --> 1:13:19.660
[Amber]<i> And so, I'm hoping</i>
<i> it's all been enough</i>

1:13:19.763 --> 1:13:21.562
<i> to get me to my goal today.</i>

1:13:22.732 --> 1:13:24.565
<i> So I can show him</i>
<i> I'm ready to do</i>

1:13:24.667 --> 1:13:26.000
<i> what I need to get healthy.</i>

1:13:28.004 --> 1:13:30.605
<i> And, hopefully,</i>
<i> get my revision surgery soon.</i>

1:13:32.609 --> 1:13:34.208
Okay, Amber, you wanna
step up on the scale.

1:13:34.310 --> 1:13:35.877
We're gonna weigh you first.

1:13:35.979 --> 1:13:37.145
Hold on, one sec.

1:13:40.283 --> 1:13:41.115
Okay.

1:13:44.687 --> 1:13:46.254
[Amber]
<i> The last time my weight</i>

1:13:46.356 --> 1:13:48.189
<i> was at 505.</i>

1:13:48.291 --> 1:13:51.426
<i> And my goal has been</i>
<i> to lose 50 pounds.</i>

1:13:51.528 --> 1:13:52.760
<i> So that would put me at</i>

1:13:52.862 --> 1:13:54.529
<i> 455 today.</i>

1:13:55.298 --> 1:13:56.697
<i> If I hit that goal.</i>

1:13:59.669 --> 1:14:01.169
<i> That's close,</i>

1:14:01.271 --> 1:14:03.271
<i>and it's a lot of weight loss.</i>

1:14:03.373 --> 1:14:06.240
<i> So I'm hoping</i>
<i> Dr. Now is happy with that.</i>

1:14:06.342 --> 1:14:08.309
<i> I know I worked hard for it.</i>

1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:12.280
[Nathan]<i> I don't think</i>
<i> Amber's happy with that,</i>

1:14:12.382 --> 1:14:13.381
<i> but I think it's great.</i>

1:14:13.483 --> 1:14:14.682
<i> She made great progress.</i>

1:14:15.452 --> 1:14:17.251
Step up on the scale, please.

1:14:17.353 --> 1:14:18.786
[Nathan]<i> So, hopefully,</i>
<i> I did it too,</i>

1:14:18.888 --> 1:14:20.455
<i> and I lost as much as her.</i>

1:14:21.558 --> 1:14:23.524
<i> At my last appointment,</i>
<i> two months ago,</i>

1:14:23.626 --> 1:14:25.626
<i> I was at 487.</i>

1:14:25.728 --> 1:14:28.396
<i> And I'm supposed to be losing</i>
<i> 20 pounds a month.</i>

1:14:28.498 --> 1:14:30.765
<i> To be on track,</i>
<i> I should have lost 40 pounds</i>

1:14:30.867 --> 1:14:32.700
<i> to be under 447 today.</i>

1:14:38.541 --> 1:14:39.874
What?

1:14:39.976 --> 1:14:42.310
-Literally, ten pounds
between us, that's crazy.
-[Nathan] Yeah.

1:14:43.413 --> 1:14:44.645
[Nathan]<i> I'm proud of us.</i>

1:14:44.747 --> 1:14:47.215
<i> I think we both did great.</i>
<i> So I'm really happy right now.</i>

1:14:48.351 --> 1:14:49.884
<i> Amber seems</i>
<i> a little disappointed,</i>

1:14:49.986 --> 1:14:52.453
<i> and a little down on herself.</i>

1:14:52.555 --> 1:14:55.490
<i> But I think Dr. Now is going</i>
<i> to be happy with us today.</i>

1:14:58.528 --> 1:14:59.594
[knock on door]

1:15:02.365 --> 1:15:03.631
Hello. How are y'all doing?

1:15:03.733 --> 1:15:05.066
-We're good.
-Good. How are you?

1:15:06.503 --> 1:15:07.668
All right. Well,

1:15:07.770 --> 1:15:10.304
Amber I'm glad that
you could make it this time.

1:15:10.406 --> 1:15:11.806
Sorry, I've missed
the last appointment.

1:15:11.908 --> 1:15:13.407
It won't happen again.

1:15:13.510 --> 1:15:15.109
[Dr. Now] All right.
I'm glad to hear that.

1:15:15.211 --> 1:15:17.945
And I'm glad to see that
you're making some progress.

1:15:18.047 --> 1:15:18.913
Thank you.

1:15:19.015 --> 1:15:20.848
You both have been
making progress.

1:15:20.950 --> 1:15:21.782
So that's good.

1:15:22.719 --> 1:15:24.418
So what is it helping you

1:15:24.521 --> 1:15:25.753
to get back on track?

1:15:25.855 --> 1:15:27.855
Uh, seeing Dr. Paradise,

1:15:27.957 --> 1:15:30.424
and doing the therapy
helped a lot.

1:15:30.527 --> 1:15:32.293
He helped us realize that,

1:15:32.395 --> 1:15:34.862
um, there were things that
we needed to work on.

1:15:34.964 --> 1:15:36.797
[Amber] The dynamic
for us is different

1:15:36.900 --> 1:15:38.032
than a lot of people.

1:15:38.134 --> 1:15:39.667
[Nathan] So it was hard,
but it was really good.

1:15:39.769 --> 1:15:42.503
It made us really look at
how we are as a couple,

1:15:42.605 --> 1:15:43.504
and work on that.

1:15:43.606 --> 1:15:45.339
We started putting those
in place.

1:15:45.441 --> 1:15:46.874
All right. So,

1:15:46.976 --> 1:15:50.845
the key issue will be to
continue that for a long term.

1:15:50.947 --> 1:15:52.013
Yes.

1:15:52.115 --> 1:15:53.614
All right.
I'm glad to hear that.

1:15:53.716 --> 1:15:54.982
All right. So Amber,

1:15:55.084 --> 1:15:58.319
you're down to 461.
So, essentially,

1:15:58.421 --> 1:16:00.221
so far you've lost 40 pounds.

1:16:00.323 --> 1:16:02.657
So that's a good progress,

1:16:02.759 --> 1:16:04.225
and you need to keep it up.

1:16:04.327 --> 1:16:05.226
Yes, sir. I will.

1:16:05.328 --> 1:16:06.661
[Dr. Now] Here is what
I'm willing to do.

1:16:06.763 --> 1:16:09.997
We'll do an endoscopy on you
to see how things are

1:16:10.099 --> 1:16:13.301
with your first weight loss
surgery you had
when you were younger,

1:16:13.403 --> 1:16:16.537
to see if a revision
is possible.

1:16:16.639 --> 1:16:19.307
There could be scar tissue
or other reasons

1:16:19.409 --> 1:16:20.808
preventing the revision

1:16:20.910 --> 1:16:22.209
or another weigh loss surgery.

1:16:22.312 --> 1:16:25.079
If everything looks good,
I'll schedule you

1:16:25.181 --> 1:16:28.416
for a weight loss surgery
revision in two months.

1:16:28.518 --> 1:16:29.884
-Okay.
-And if you lost

1:16:29.986 --> 1:16:32.053
another 25 pounds by then,

1:16:32.155 --> 1:16:34.055
then we will move ahead
with you.

1:16:34.157 --> 1:16:35.690
But if not, we'll cancel it

1:16:35.792 --> 1:16:38.726
and we will be back
at square one with you.

1:16:38.828 --> 1:16:41.996
-So, does that sound fair?
-Yes, sir.

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:43.030
You think you can do that?

1:16:43.132 --> 1:16:46.033
-Definitely, I can do that.
-Okay. Great.

1:16:46.135 --> 1:16:48.736
We will set that up
and we'll go from there.

1:16:48.838 --> 1:16:50.838
But I'm proud
of both of your progress.

1:16:50.940 --> 1:16:52.239
So keep up the good work.

1:16:52.342 --> 1:16:53.274
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

1:16:53.376 --> 1:16:54.842
-[Amber] Thank you.
-All right.

1:16:54.944 --> 1:16:56.210
Do you all have
any questions?

1:16:56.312 --> 1:16:57.244
-No, sir.
-No.

1:16:57.347 --> 1:16:58.279
Okay, Amber,

1:16:58.381 --> 1:17:00.247
we will schedule
your endoscopy,

1:17:00.350 --> 1:17:01.782
and I will see you both soon.

1:17:01.884 --> 1:17:02.783
In the meantime,

1:17:02.885 --> 1:17:04.752
if you have any question,
give me a call.

1:17:04.854 --> 1:17:05.886
[both] Yes, sir.

1:17:05.989 --> 1:17:07.355
-Thank you.
-All right.

1:17:07.457 --> 1:17:09.557
-I'll see you all later.
-[both] All right.

1:17:09.659 --> 1:17:11.258
All right,
if you need anything,
give me a call.

1:17:11.361 --> 1:17:12.193
[both] Yes, sir.

1:17:18.034 --> 1:17:20.635
<i> I'm very happy to see</i>
<i> the improved progress</i>

1:17:20.737 --> 1:17:22.970
with both Nathan and Amber.

1:17:23.072 --> 1:17:25.906
<i> I was initially concerned</i>
<i> about Amber,</i>

1:17:26.009 --> 1:17:29.477
<i> because of the fact</i>
<i> she has already failed</i>
<i> one weight loss surgery,</i>

1:17:29.579 --> 1:17:32.113
and because of the pattern
I've seen from her,

1:17:32.215 --> 1:17:35.716
<i> where she seems to avoid</i>
<i> responsibility for her part,</i>

1:17:35.818 --> 1:17:39.253
with the negative dynamic
between her and Nathan.

1:17:39.355 --> 1:17:41.489
<i> But I'm glad to see</i>
<i> that's not the case.</i>

1:17:41.591 --> 1:17:44.558
And that she is starting
to make the changes
she needs

1:17:44.661 --> 1:17:47.395
<i> to move in a positive</i>
<i> direction with Nathan.</i>

1:17:47.497 --> 1:17:50.164
<i> So we'll see</i>
<i> how her endoscopy looks,</i>

1:17:50.266 --> 1:17:52.566
and how she does
in the next couple of months,

1:17:52.669 --> 1:17:54.068
<i> and go from there.</i>

1:17:54.170 --> 1:17:55.569
<i> But they are both doing well,</i>

1:17:55.672 --> 1:17:58.105
<i> and I'm confident,</i>
<i> Nathan is committed</i>

1:17:58.207 --> 1:17:59.507
<i> to do this for the long run.</i>

1:17:59.609 --> 1:18:02.109
<i> And if Amber can get</i>
<i> to where she's ready</i>

1:18:02.211 --> 1:18:03.678
<i> to take the next big step,</i>

1:18:03.780 --> 1:18:05.246
<i> and get her revision,</i>

1:18:05.348 --> 1:18:07.782
then they will both have
a fighting chance

1:18:07.884 --> 1:18:10.484
<i> to not only make the progress</i>
<i> they need now,</i>

1:18:10.586 --> 1:18:13.754
<i> but stick to it</i>
<i> to be healthy for a lifetime.</i>

1:18:28.438 --> 1:18:31.272
[Amber]
<i> I'm here at the hospital</i>
<i> for my endoscopy.</i>

1:18:31.374 --> 1:18:33.441
<i> But I'm getting</i>
<i> my weight checked on first</i>

1:18:33.543 --> 1:18:36.110
<i> to see how I've been doing</i>
<i> the past month.</i>

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:40.214
[nurse] 454.2.

1:18:42.085 --> 1:18:43.551
-Yeah, it works.
-[nurse] 454.2.

1:18:44.454 --> 1:18:48.222
[Amber]<i> I'm still moving along</i>
<i> and I'm getting there.</i>

1:18:48.324 --> 1:18:51.826
<i> So, hopefully,</i>
<i> that leads to me</i>
<i> getting the revision.</i>

1:18:51.928 --> 1:18:54.061
<i> Because I've been working</i>
<i> really hard for it</i>

1:18:54.163 --> 1:18:57.164
<i> and I know that's a tool</i>
<i> I'm gonna need</i>
<i> for the long term.</i>

1:18:58.434 --> 1:18:59.567
<i> But it's all gonna come down</i>

1:18:59.669 --> 1:19:01.802
<i> to how things are</i>
<i> in my abdomen</i>

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:04.739
<i> from my last weight loss</i>
<i> surgery, I guess.</i>

1:19:04.841 --> 1:19:08.476
<i> I'm a little nervous</i>
<i> because I really want</i>
<i> to have the surgery.</i>

1:19:08.578 --> 1:19:10.044
<i> But at the same time,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

1:19:10.146 --> 1:19:11.712
<i> this part is out of my hands.</i>

1:19:11.814 --> 1:19:13.581
<i>So it will just be what it is.</i>

1:19:14.650 --> 1:19:15.549
<i> But I'm confident</i>

1:19:15.651 --> 1:19:17.051
<i> that if there's a way</i>
<i> to do it,</i>

1:19:17.153 --> 1:19:18.686
<i> Dr. Now will figure it out.</i>

1:19:21.958 --> 1:19:24.558
[Dr. Now]<i> Today, we are doing</i>
<i> endoscopy on Amber</i>

1:19:24.660 --> 1:19:27.928
<i> to see if it's possible to do</i>
<i> any sort of revision</i>

1:19:28.030 --> 1:19:29.864
<i> or weight loss surgery on her</i>

1:19:29.966 --> 1:19:32.933
<i> since she already had one</i>
<i> when she was younger.</i>

1:19:33.035 --> 1:19:35.503
<i> The issue that</i>
<i> this can create is,</i>

1:19:35.605 --> 1:19:38.539
<i> the first surgery</i>
<i> can result in scar tissue.</i>

1:19:38.641 --> 1:19:42.042
<i> That limits what we can do</i>
<i> for a second surgery</i>

1:19:42.145 --> 1:19:44.178
<i> especially, when it involves</i>

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:46.380
<i> stomach stapling</i>
<i> like Amber describes.</i>

1:19:46.482 --> 1:19:48.749
<i> So we are looking</i>
<i> inside of her stomach,</i>

1:19:48.851 --> 1:19:52.520
<i> and if the previous operation</i>
<i> created any issues</i>

1:19:52.622 --> 1:19:55.456
<i> that will prevent</i>
<i> another weight loss surgery.</i>

1:19:56.292 --> 1:19:58.025
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:20:01.697 --> 1:20:02.963
Let's begin.

1:20:04.834 --> 1:20:05.900
Hold there.

1:20:06.636 --> 1:20:07.802
Okay.

1:20:07.904 --> 1:20:09.503
Move to the left some.

1:20:11.674 --> 1:20:13.874
All right. Hold it there.

1:20:13.976 --> 1:20:17.611
Her staple line
is really narrow and long.

1:20:17.713 --> 1:20:20.014
And so, it's gonna be
an issue.

1:20:20.817 --> 1:20:22.383
It isn't looking good.

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:25.753
Okay. We are done.

1:20:31.928 --> 1:20:34.228
<i> Amber has very</i>
<i> difficult situation.</i>

1:20:34.330 --> 1:20:36.230
<i> She has a previous</i>
<i> gastroplasty,</i>

1:20:36.332 --> 1:20:37.631
<i> which is a staple line,</i>

1:20:37.733 --> 1:20:39.900
<i> which is very narrow</i>
<i> staple line,</i>

1:20:40.002 --> 1:20:43.103
<i> and leaving a very small</i>
<i> stomach on one side.</i>

1:20:43.206 --> 1:20:45.439
<i> That make it very difficult</i>
<i> to work with that.</i>

1:20:45.541 --> 1:20:47.675
There is practically
no way to do

1:20:47.777 --> 1:20:49.443
a sleeve gastrectomy here

1:20:49.545 --> 1:20:51.445
<i> because staple line will</i>
<i> make it so narrow that</i>

1:20:51.547 --> 1:20:53.414
<i> she won't be able to swallow.</i>

1:20:53.516 --> 1:20:55.115
<i> So, the only potential</i>
<i> for revision</i>

1:20:55.218 --> 1:20:56.851
<i> will be gastric bypass,</i>

1:20:56.953 --> 1:20:58.786
which is a more
complex operation

1:20:58.888 --> 1:21:00.154
than sleeve gastrectomy.

1:21:00.256 --> 1:21:04.124
<i> But it's the only option</i>
<i> she has in her situation</i>

1:21:04.227 --> 1:21:06.760
<i> because, essentially, she has</i>
<i> very narrow staple line.</i>

1:21:06.863 --> 1:21:09.430
<i> So the sleeve will result</i>
<i> in a stomach</i>

1:21:09.532 --> 1:21:11.098
that is too narrow
and too small

1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:12.833
with the staple line
that she got.

1:21:12.935 --> 1:21:14.468
<i> So the only option will be</i>

1:21:14.570 --> 1:21:16.370
<i> that we do</i>
<i> gastric bypass on her.</i>

1:21:16.472 --> 1:21:18.806
<i> But that option</i>
<i> is still gonna be difficult</i>

1:21:18.908 --> 1:21:21.108
<i> because of those</i>
<i> scar tissues she has.</i>

1:21:21.210 --> 1:21:23.711
<i> But we can work with it</i>
<i> to do a bypass</i>

1:21:23.813 --> 1:21:27.314
<i> if Amber is gonna stay</i>
<i> committed to doing</i>
<i> what she needs</i>

1:21:27.416 --> 1:21:29.283
<i> to make the second</i>
<i> weight loss surgery</i>

1:21:29.385 --> 1:21:30.618
<i> successful this time.</i>

1:21:34.590 --> 1:21:36.290
-Hi, Amber.
-Hey, Dr. Now.

1:21:36.392 --> 1:21:37.791
-You awake?
-I'm awake.

1:21:37.894 --> 1:21:40.294
All right. Well,
we did the endoscopy.

1:21:40.396 --> 1:21:42.630
You do have
a very difficult situation

1:21:42.732 --> 1:21:44.965
-because you got
a narrow staple line...
-Mmmhmm.

1:21:45.067 --> 1:21:47.868
...which is about
seven inches long.

1:21:47.970 --> 1:21:50.471
And that is making it
very, very difficult

1:21:50.573 --> 1:21:53.741
to be able to correct that
to sleeve

1:21:53.843 --> 1:21:55.676
because we need more room
for that.

1:21:55.778 --> 1:21:58.245
Because it's so narrow,
you can have reflux

1:21:58.347 --> 1:21:59.213
and issue.

1:21:59.315 --> 1:22:00.981
The only possible way

1:22:01.083 --> 1:22:04.251
-is to convert that
to a gastric bypass.
-Okay.

1:22:04.353 --> 1:22:07.655
So we'll schedule that
for two months from now.

1:22:07.757 --> 1:22:09.657
-All right. Sounds great.
-I'll see you later.

1:22:09.759 --> 1:22:10.958
-See you later.
-Okay.

1:22:12.695 --> 1:22:15.863
[Dr. Now]<i> Right now,</i>
<i> I'm encouraged</i>
<i> by Amber's progress,</i>

1:22:15.965 --> 1:22:17.765
and I'm happy to see

1:22:17.867 --> 1:22:20.834
<i> Amber lost seven pounds</i>
<i> over the last month.</i>

1:22:20.937 --> 1:22:22.937
<i>So hopefully, she sticks to it</i>

1:22:23.039 --> 1:22:26.573
<i> and we are able to move ahead</i>
<i> with her weight loss</i>
<i> surgery soon.</i>

1:22:26.676 --> 1:22:28.275
<i> So that both she and Nathan</i>

1:22:28.377 --> 1:22:31.278
<i> can take advantage</i>
<i> of having the same tools</i>

1:22:31.380 --> 1:22:33.180
<i> to continue to work together,</i>

1:22:33.282 --> 1:22:36.684
<i>to be able to make the changes</i>
<i> that will last a lifetime.</i>

1:22:36.786 --> 1:22:38.953
<i> And from what I'm seeing now,</i>

1:22:39.055 --> 1:22:42.156
<i> I'm optimistic that</i>
<i> they'll be able to do that.</i>

1:22:57.540 --> 1:23:00.074
[Nathan]<i> Amber and I</i>
<i> had another appointment</i>
<i> with Dr. Now today,</i>

1:23:00.176 --> 1:23:01.208
<i> and it went well.</i>

1:23:01.310 --> 1:23:02.609
<i> He says we are on track.</i>

1:23:02.712 --> 1:23:04.411
<i> And the really good news</i>
<i> is that</i>

1:23:04.513 --> 1:23:06.714
<i> he scheduled Amber's surgery</i>
<i> for next month.</i>

1:23:06.816 --> 1:23:09.383
<i> So, we're both excited</i>
<i> about that.</i>

1:23:09.485 --> 1:23:12.386
<i> I told Amber that</i>
<i> I wanted to stay the night</i>
<i> in Houston.</i>

1:23:12.488 --> 1:23:15.122
<i> So we could go out</i>
<i> and have a date night</i>
<i> in the city.</i>

1:23:15.224 --> 1:23:17.725
<i> And a theater in the park</i>
<i> sounded perfect.</i>

1:23:17.827 --> 1:23:20.961
[Amber]<i> When Nathan told me</i>
<i> his idea to stay in Houston</i>
<i> and go out,</i>

1:23:21.063 --> 1:23:22.997
<i> I wasn't sure</i>
<i> if it was a good idea.</i>

1:23:23.099 --> 1:23:26.300
<i> Because I didn't know</i>
<i> if this was gonna lead</i>
<i> to any sort of temptation.</i>

1:23:26.402 --> 1:23:29.236
<i> Because that's what we have</i>
<i> always done together.</i>

1:23:29.338 --> 1:23:31.939
<i> But I decided I was gonna</i>
<i> keep an open mind.</i>

1:23:32.041 --> 1:23:33.407
[Nathan]<i> We're not</i>
<i> eating together.</i>

1:23:33.509 --> 1:23:35.476
<i> But there are things</i>
<i> that we can try to do</i>

1:23:35.578 --> 1:23:37.878
<i> to bring some romance</i>
<i> back into our relationship.</i>

1:23:38.714 --> 1:23:41.281
<i> But I know</i>
<i> that's gonna take time.</i>

1:23:41.384 --> 1:23:43.817
[Amber]<i> I do think</i>
<i> Nathan is on the right track</i>

1:23:43.919 --> 1:23:46.186
to him kind of
going back to being

1:23:46.288 --> 1:23:49.089
my husband,
back like it was originally.

1:23:49.191 --> 1:23:50.524
<i> But it's a work in progress.</i>

1:23:51.394 --> 1:23:52.926
<i> And maybe we'll get there.</i>

1:23:53.362 --> 1:23:54.595
<i> Who knows?</i>

1:23:54.697 --> 1:23:56.163
<i> It just depends on</i>
<i> how things go.</i>

1:23:56.265 --> 1:23:58.699
I'm not gonna rush in,
and I don't think
he should either.

1:24:05.374 --> 1:24:06.540
How you have been doing?

1:24:06.642 --> 1:24:08.175
As far as what?

1:24:08.277 --> 1:24:09.643
Just the whole process.

1:24:10.446 --> 1:24:12.312
A lot better.

1:24:12.415 --> 1:24:15.549
About a month ago,
I wouldn't have been
able to do this.

1:24:15.651 --> 1:24:17.651
[Nathan]<i> I know Amber and I</i>
<i> have a lot to work on</i>

1:24:17.753 --> 1:24:18.952
<i> to get back to a good place.</i>

1:24:19.622 --> 1:24:21.155
<i> But with all my weight loss,</i>

1:24:21.257 --> 1:24:23.824
<i> my relationship</i>
<i> with my daughter, Hannah,</i>
<i> has improved.</i>

1:24:23.926 --> 1:24:25.559
<i> Because I'm actually</i>
<i> able to go out</i>

1:24:25.661 --> 1:24:26.660
<i> and spend time with her.</i>

1:24:27.630 --> 1:24:28.829
<i>So we've been hiking together,</i>

1:24:28.931 --> 1:24:31.732
<i> and going on nature walks</i>
<i> at least twice a week.</i>

1:24:31.834 --> 1:24:34.134
<i> And she keeps telling me</i>
<i> she's proud of me.</i>

1:24:34.236 --> 1:24:37.371
<i> When before, I think,</i>
<i> she was a little</i>
<i> embarrassed by me.</i>

1:24:37.473 --> 1:24:41.341
<i> And I just hope that</i>
<i> I can also become the husband</i>
<i> that Amber deserves too.</i>

1:24:42.078 --> 1:24:43.510
<i> One big step I'm taking</i>

1:24:43.612 --> 1:24:45.179
<i> is I have decided</i>
<i> to go back to work.</i>

1:24:45.281 --> 1:24:46.713
<i> I still have my lymphedema</i>

1:24:46.816 --> 1:24:48.082
<i> and it still hurts</i>
<i> when I walk,</i>

1:24:48.184 --> 1:24:49.516
<i> but it's gotten</i>
<i> a little better.</i>

1:24:50.586 --> 1:24:51.652
<i> I feel ready for it.</i>

1:24:51.754 --> 1:24:53.320
<i> So I'm no longer</i>
<i> taking a leave.</i>

1:24:53.422 --> 1:24:54.988
<i> So I'm really excited</i>
<i> about that,</i>

1:24:55.091 --> 1:24:56.690
<i> and know</i>
<i> as I make more progress,</i>

1:24:56.792 --> 1:24:58.892
<i> I'm going to be able</i>
<i> to do more and more</i>

1:24:58.994 --> 1:25:01.061
<i> and I'm looking forward</i>
<i> to all that.</i>

1:25:01.163 --> 1:25:02.996
So what are you gonna think
about when I'm all skinny?

1:25:03.099 --> 1:25:04.531
You're gonna look
like a cartoon character.

1:25:04.633 --> 1:25:06.700
With a big head,
and a really skinny body.

1:25:06.802 --> 1:25:07.634
[laughs]

1:25:08.604 --> 1:25:09.870
[Nathan] How rude?

1:25:10.706 --> 1:25:12.539
<i> This is a journey.</i>

1:25:12.641 --> 1:25:15.609
<i> One that involves much more</i>
<i> than I could have realized,</i>

1:25:15.711 --> 1:25:17.778
<i> as harder than I ever thought</i>
<i> it would be.</i>

1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:19.746
<i> But it's good</i>
<i> and I'm happy to be on it,</i>

1:25:19.849 --> 1:25:21.315
<i> and headed to where</i>
<i> we're going.</i>

1:25:22.451 --> 1:25:24.551
<i> Because I know</i>
<i> it's a much better place.</i>
