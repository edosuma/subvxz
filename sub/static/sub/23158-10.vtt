WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:02.564
You've been hired
to be my bodyguard.

00:05.345 --> 00:07.438
Two men were in here.
One had a gun.

00:07.513 --> 00:10.641
You're working for Lucia
Prince of the Giroux Ballet?

00:10.717 --> 00:13.914
The body I am supposed to be guarding
isn't being very cooperative.

00:13.987 --> 00:14.976
Tough.

00:15.054 --> 00:17.045
<i>You just gotta know</i>
<i>how to handle them.</i>

00:17.924 --> 00:19.050
Honey.

00:22.528 --> 00:23.688
Hello?

00:23.763 --> 00:25.856
<i>We don't want to hurt you,</i>
<i>Miss Chase.</i>

00:25.932 --> 00:27.331
What do you want?

03:40.294 --> 03:42.694
Magnificent, Kendall.
Magnificent, dear.

03:42.763 --> 03:44.355
It was average.

03:45.332 --> 03:48.267
Giris, don't stand.
Hurry up, hurry up.

03:48.735 --> 03:50.703
Hurry up, get changed.
Come on.

04:02.049 --> 04:04.017
Martina?
Kendall, what's wrong?

04:04.084 --> 04:05.483
Watch out
for Leibowitz tonight.

04:05.552 --> 04:06.746
He's absolutely incredible.

04:06.820 --> 04:08.788
It's as if he were
on speed or something.

04:08.856 --> 04:12.223
This the last time I'm working
with these second-rate conductors.

04:12.292 --> 04:13.316
Oh, wonderful.

04:13.393 --> 04:15.486
Is this coffee hot?
Help yourself.

04:15.696 --> 04:17.391
Oh, no. Do you have
any rouge?

04:17.664 --> 04:19.791
Yeah, in my bag in my room.

04:27.007 --> 04:28.269
Martina!

04:28.942 --> 04:29.931
Martina!

04:31.778 --> 04:33.040
Martina!

04:33.380 --> 04:34.369
What happened?

04:34.448 --> 04:35.437
L... I don't know.

04:35.516 --> 04:37.484
Two men were in here.
One had a gun.

04:37.551 --> 04:38.575
What?
Martina!

04:38.652 --> 04:40.176
Martina,
are you all right?

04:40.254 --> 04:41.516
What happened?
Two men.

04:41.588 --> 04:42.646
In my dressing room.

04:42.723 --> 04:44.122
But who, and why?

04:44.191 --> 04:46.489
I don't know.
But I want better security.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.926
And a new conductor, now
that we're talking about it.

04:48.996 --> 04:51.294
Kendall, we have security.

04:51.498 --> 04:55.059
Lucia, I want better security.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.088
Rick, are you there? Rick?

05:19.760 --> 05:21.159
Are you there?

05:21.228 --> 05:22.695
<i>Rick?</i>

05:25.566 --> 05:27.363
<i>Are you there, Rick?</i>

05:31.805 --> 05:33.636
Yes, I'm here. But, it's not.

05:34.841 --> 05:36.536
Darn it. I've looked
in the drawers,

05:36.610 --> 05:38.475
the closet, under the bed.
Everywhere.

05:38.545 --> 05:39.876
<i>You try the refrigerator?</i>

05:39.947 --> 05:42.814
This isn't funny, Rick.
That's a $3,500 lens.

05:42.950 --> 05:45.111
All right, all right,
why don't you check with T.C.?

05:45.185 --> 05:46.846
Look, maybe you left it up
in the helicopter

05:46.920 --> 05:48.251
the last time
you guys were up.

05:48.322 --> 05:49.846
<i>I already did.</i>

05:49.923 --> 05:51.982
Well, don't get shook up.
It'll turn up.

05:52.059 --> 05:53.924
Just stay away from Higgins
until it does.

05:53.994 --> 05:55.757
I can't.
He's waiting for me now.

05:55.829 --> 05:57.091
I gotta do
something for Robin.

05:57.164 --> 05:59.223
A personal favor of some kind.
Keep looking.

06:11.878 --> 06:16.178
Five and six
and seven and eight,

06:16.250 --> 06:19.617
and one and two
and three and four.

06:19.686 --> 06:20.744
Ah!

06:21.722 --> 06:23.713
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

06:24.791 --> 06:26.952
Oh, you broke my shoe.

06:27.027 --> 06:29.359
Well, I didn't see you
until it was too late.

06:29.630 --> 06:32.690
You knocked me down, ran me over,
and broke my favorite shoe.

06:32.766 --> 06:34.825
Well, I didn't mean to.
Look, actually,

06:34.901 --> 06:36.493
it's just the laces
that are broken.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.697
I'm sure you've got
another pair, don't you?

06:38.905 --> 06:40.896
Take a break, everybody.

06:44.311 --> 06:47.576
Look, I was in a hurry
and I couldn't stop in time.

06:47.981 --> 06:50.347
I suppose you can't
help it if you're clumsy.

06:50.417 --> 06:52.681
I'm not clumsy.
I just didn't see you.

06:52.753 --> 06:56.154
Even at this place, I didn't expect
to see people dancing on the lawn.

06:56.623 --> 07:00.787
I'm sorry you're having to
wait like this, Miss Prince.

07:01.461 --> 07:03.588
I, uh, don't know
what's keeping him.

07:03.664 --> 07:05.825
It's perfectly all right.
Thank you.

07:05.899 --> 07:08.129
You could've moved out of the way, too,
you know.

07:08.201 --> 07:11.170
I was dancing. You were the
one who came lumbering through.

07:11.238 --> 07:12.296
Lumbering?

07:13.507 --> 07:16.965
Well, uh, I see you two
have already met.

07:19.746 --> 07:22.715
Allow me to introduce
Miss Lucia Prince,

07:22.783 --> 07:25.775
co-director and choreographer
of the Giroux Ballet Company,

07:25.852 --> 07:28.013
and an old friend
of Mr. Masters.

07:28.088 --> 07:29.612
Miss Prince,
this is Thomas Magnum.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.487
How do you do?
How do you do?

07:32.059 --> 07:33.856
Uh, Kendall, please.

07:34.961 --> 07:39.295
Mr. Magnum, when Robin heard we
were coming to Hawaii to perform,

07:39.366 --> 07:41.732
he insisted we stay
here at the estate.

07:41.802 --> 07:44.669
He also said that
you might be willing

07:44.738 --> 07:47.138
to accommodate
a request of mine.

07:47.507 --> 07:49.907
In return for payment,
of course.

07:51.478 --> 07:54.379
What kind of request
are you talking about?

07:54.514 --> 07:55.572
Well, you see...

07:55.649 --> 07:58.447
You've been hired
to be my bodyguard.

07:58.752 --> 08:00.310
Yes.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.924
There he is.
Just take it easy.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.194
No, no, no!

08:15.268 --> 08:18.829
I rearranged my schedule just to play
volleyball with you this afternoon,

08:18.905 --> 08:19.963
and you don't even show up.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.305
I'm sorry, T.C. This just came up this
morning. I couldn't get out of it.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.537
Mmm-hmm,
you could've called.

08:24.611 --> 08:27.546
I'm only doing it as a personal
favor to Robin. It's his friend.

08:27.614 --> 08:28.638
Who is it?

08:28.715 --> 08:31.616
Ah, some ballet person.
Lucia Prince.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.948
I'm babysitting
one of her dancers.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.351
Lucia Prince?

08:35.422 --> 08:38.448
You're working for Lucia
Prince of the Giroux Ballet?

08:38.792 --> 08:40.419
That's right.
Do you know her?

08:40.494 --> 08:42.121
Do I know her?

08:42.195 --> 08:46.461
I just happen to have tickets to all
of their performances at the Blaisdell.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.763
Oh, which one
are you guarding?

08:49.870 --> 08:51.735
The one in the middle.

09:02.182 --> 09:03.911
Kendall Chase?

09:04.050 --> 09:05.984
Hey, T.M., you're not
pulling my leg or nothin',

09:06.052 --> 09:09.283
I mean, just tryin' to get back at me
because of that volleyball madness?

09:09.356 --> 09:10.414
No.

09:10.557 --> 09:12.149
So who's this guy
Kendall Chase?

09:12.526 --> 09:16.428
She is only one of
the worid's prima ballerinas.

09:16.496 --> 09:19.260
She was a principal dancer
with the Giroux Ballet Company.

09:19.332 --> 09:22.460
Before that she was with the
New York under Balanchine.

09:22.536 --> 09:26.734
She also danced with the Royal,
the Bolshoi, the Kirov,

09:26.807 --> 09:31.107
and she was the first American
to win the International
Competition in Leningrad.

09:31.178 --> 09:32.975
Kendall Chase. Oh.

09:33.046 --> 09:35.571
T.C., since when did you
become a dance maniac?

09:36.216 --> 09:39.777
Aficionado, aficionado.
I've always loved the ballet.

09:42.422 --> 09:43.946
T. M, uh,

09:44.324 --> 09:47.088
you wouldn't need a little help
from an old pal, would you?

09:50.630 --> 09:53.463
T.C., are you volunteering
to help me on a case?

09:53.533 --> 09:54.727
Uh-huh.

09:54.801 --> 09:57.497
Oh, but I can't meet her dressed
like this. I got to go change.

09:57.571 --> 09:59.869
Look, uh, just give me a few minutes.
I'll be right back.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.464
Don't do nothing.
Don't go nowhere.

10:01.541 --> 10:03.441
Just wait on me, okay?

10:05.779 --> 10:07.110
It's Nam.

10:07.948 --> 10:09.347
He cracked.

10:09.416 --> 10:11.179
We just never realized it.

10:22.295 --> 10:24.923
T.C., maybe I better warn you
a little bit about Kendall.

10:24.998 --> 10:26.260
No need, baby.
No need.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.267
She may not be exactly
what you expect.

10:28.335 --> 10:30.166
I mean, personality-wise,
you know?

10:30.237 --> 10:32.865
She's a dancer.
They're not like everyday people.

10:32.939 --> 10:34.736
They're like thoroughbreds,

10:34.808 --> 10:37.299
always pawing at the dirt until
they get down on the track

10:37.377 --> 10:39.311
in front of a crowd
doing their thing.

10:39.379 --> 10:41.313
Man, sometimes
when they're not running,

10:41.381 --> 10:43.576
they... they just feel like
they're out of place.

10:43.650 --> 10:46.141
You just gotta know
how to handle them.

10:46.219 --> 10:47.743
Come on, there she is.

10:59.933 --> 11:01.457
Ms. Chase.

11:02.736 --> 11:03.896
Sorry.

11:05.005 --> 11:08.600
I would like you to meet a friend of
mine. T.C., this is Kendall Chase.

11:12.879 --> 11:15.643
This is a real honor,
Miss Chase.

11:18.051 --> 11:20.383
The last time I saw
you perform in person,

11:20.453 --> 11:22.284
it was with
the San Francisco Ballet.

11:22.355 --> 11:25.347
You did the pas de deux
for <i>Romeo & Juliet.</i>

11:29.162 --> 11:32.325
Oh, my goodness.
I was practically a kid.

11:33.099 --> 11:35.465
As a matter of fact,
I remember actually being upset

11:35.535 --> 11:37.503
because they thought
I looked 16.

11:37.571 --> 11:40.165
Well, your dancing
sure quieted them.

11:42.175 --> 11:44.735
Well, um, I better
get into costume.

11:46.146 --> 11:48.808
You will stay
for the performance, I hope.

11:49.349 --> 11:51.681
I wouldn't miss it
for the worid.

11:57.624 --> 11:59.455
Okay, kids, that's it.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.088
You just gotta know
how to handle 'em.

12:08.835 --> 12:11.235
Looks like she's
hired some protection.

12:11.304 --> 12:12.794
Yeah, I've been
watchin' this guy.

12:12.872 --> 12:15.170
I don't think he's here
to see a ballet.

12:21.081 --> 12:23.311
He's been hanging around
all afternoon.

12:23.383 --> 12:24.714
Bodyguard?

12:24.985 --> 12:26.282
Probably.

12:27.821 --> 12:29.550
Could be a problem.

12:41.267 --> 12:43.531
You can't do that anymore.

12:44.371 --> 12:46.965
You can't just switch your
schedule at the last minute,

12:47.040 --> 12:49.304
go off, and do
whatever you want.

12:49.376 --> 12:51.344
I don't understand
what the big deal was.

12:51.411 --> 12:54.812
All I did was go in to rehearse
at the theater this morning.

12:54.881 --> 12:58.373
Exactly. And while you were
at the theater at 6:00 a.m.,

12:58.451 --> 13:00.146
I was still here.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.188
Now, like it or not,
you gotta stick by me.

13:02.255 --> 13:03.483
Wrong.

13:03.556 --> 13:06.184
You're the bodyguard.
You stick by me.

13:06.259 --> 13:07.283
Fine.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.921
But the body I am supposed to be
guarding isn't being very cooperative.

13:10.997 --> 13:13.261
Although, I don't know why
that should surprise me.

13:13.333 --> 13:17.360
Look, Mr. Private Investigator,
I am very good at what I do.

13:18.038 --> 13:20.199
That because
I work very hard.

13:20.273 --> 13:22.138
I have danced
with sprained ankles,

13:22.208 --> 13:23.732
broken toes
and torn ligaments.

13:23.810 --> 13:26.040
I'm not expecting you
to bleed over my pain.

13:26.112 --> 13:28.637
So why are you expecting
me to bleed over yours?

13:28.715 --> 13:30.546
If I'm difficult to guard,

13:30.617 --> 13:31.777
tough.

13:31.851 --> 13:33.478
That's your job.

13:41.094 --> 13:42.857
<i>If this had been</i>
<i>a regular hire,</i>

13:42.929 --> 13:45.921
<i>I would've told Ms. Chase</i>
<i>where to stick her toe shoe.</i>

13:45.999 --> 13:47.557
<i>But, since</i>
<i>it came through Robin,</i>

13:47.634 --> 13:51.536
<i>I had to take a deep breath,</i>
<i>count to 10, and remember my blessings.</i>

13:53.807 --> 13:56.105
Magnum. Miss Chase.

14:00.246 --> 14:01.508
Magnum?

14:04.984 --> 14:06.315
Magnum!

14:09.856 --> 14:11.255
Magnum.

14:11.324 --> 14:12.916
I say, are you deaf?

14:12.992 --> 14:14.687
Oh, hi, Higgins.

14:14.761 --> 14:16.422
Where is
Robin Masters' camera?

14:16.496 --> 14:18.054
I asked you for it
two days ago.

14:18.131 --> 14:19.792
Oh, I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

14:19.866 --> 14:22.357
If you remind me this afternoon,
I'll give it to you.

14:25.538 --> 14:27.438
I'm reminding you now.

14:28.108 --> 14:30.076
I don't wish
to wait for this afternoon.

14:30.143 --> 14:32.634
Higgins, I've been all wrapped
up in this favor to Robin,

14:32.712 --> 14:34.942
and I just knew you wanted
me to put that first.

14:35.014 --> 14:37.039
Nothing's happened to that camera,
has it, Magnum?

14:38.218 --> 14:40.686
Of course not. I just gotta
put a few attachments together,

14:40.754 --> 14:42.688
clean the lenses,
that sort of thing. Hello.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.553
<i>Find your lens yet?</i>

14:44.624 --> 14:45.648
No.

14:45.792 --> 14:47.589
Well, get your butt
down here in a hurry.

14:47.660 --> 14:48.649
<i>What's wrong?</i>

14:48.728 --> 14:51.322
Not a thing, except that I just
got you the deal of a lifetime.

14:51.397 --> 14:52.523
Come on down here.

14:52.599 --> 14:53.998
Rick, what are you
talking about?

14:54.067 --> 14:55.830
<i>I just put you on a case,</i>
<i>Sherlock.</i>

14:55.902 --> 14:57.927
You can't do that.
I'm already on a case.

14:58.872 --> 15:00.305
Yeah, well now you're on two.

15:00.373 --> 15:01.738
And boy, are you gonna
thank me.

15:01.808 --> 15:03.207
Boy, am I gonna kill you.

15:03.276 --> 15:04.743
<i>See you later, Thomas.</i>
Rick?

15:06.713 --> 15:09.307
Higgins, you gotta
do me a favor.

15:09.382 --> 15:10.508
I do not.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.552
Make sure Kendall doesn't leave
the estate. I'll be back soon.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.281
I will do nothing of the kind.

15:15.355 --> 15:17.619
Don't forget she is
Robin's guest.

15:17.690 --> 15:19.021
We're responsible.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.650
Thanks, Higgins.

15:22.195 --> 15:24.686
Magnum, you have
absolutely no right...

15:29.269 --> 15:30.600
Jeez, I thought
you'd be happy.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.728
Wrong.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.365
Oh, come on, Thomas.
For $750 a day,

15:34.440 --> 15:35.805
you can juggle
two cases at once.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.137
No, I can't.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.370
Well, you're gonna have to.

15:38.444 --> 15:39.706
I already
accepted the retainer.

15:39.779 --> 15:40.803
Give it back.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.848
I can't. I spent it.

15:42.916 --> 15:44.679
What do mean,
you already spent it?

15:44.751 --> 15:46.582
I paid your bar tab with it.

15:46.653 --> 15:48.211
Rick, you had no right.

15:48.721 --> 15:51.519
I forgot. Excuse me.
You eat in here for free.

15:51.591 --> 15:53.491
That's not what I mean.
You're not my agent.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.790
You can't do things like this
without my permission.

15:55.862 --> 15:58.831
No? I'm only the guy that
takes care of your bar bills,

15:58.898 --> 16:01.662
runs down every license plate
and ID number when you need 'em.

16:01.734 --> 16:03.395
That I have your
permission to do, huh?

16:03.469 --> 16:04.493
You know what I mean.

16:04.571 --> 16:05.697
Yeah, I know what you mean.

16:05.772 --> 16:08.673
Those favors are only
favors on your terms.

16:10.910 --> 16:13.538
Okay, fine.
You can't take the case,

16:15.181 --> 16:17.706
then you come up
with the retainer.

16:33.666 --> 16:35.133
Elaine Sellmeyer?
Yes.

16:35.201 --> 16:36.259
I'm Thomas Magnum.

16:36.336 --> 16:38.236
Oh, I'm so glad to meet you.

16:38.638 --> 16:40.003
Sit down.

16:40.273 --> 16:41.865
I, uh...

16:43.176 --> 16:45.644
I've never had to hire
a private investigator before.

16:45.712 --> 16:46.974
Miss Sellmeyer...

16:47.046 --> 16:48.070
I wouldn't now,

16:48.147 --> 16:50.945
except l... I just don't know
what else to do.

16:51.017 --> 16:53.383
Miss Sellmeyer, I'm afraid
there's been some mistake.

16:53.453 --> 16:54.613
I can't work for you.

16:54.687 --> 16:56.382
You see,
I'm already on a case.

16:57.090 --> 16:58.990
Oh. I, uh...

16:59.792 --> 17:01.453
I didn't realize.

17:02.762 --> 17:03.956
Thank you.

17:04.030 --> 17:05.622
Well, don't worry
about the retainer.

17:05.698 --> 17:07.494
I'll get it back to you
as soon as I can.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.898
I'm not worried
about the money.

17:12.739 --> 17:14.707
You don't have any time.

17:15.108 --> 17:18.009
No, I'm afraid not.
At least not right now.

17:19.244 --> 17:20.712
I understand.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.310
Here.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.046
Oh, thank you.

17:29.589 --> 17:30.749
Silly.

17:38.598 --> 17:40.759
You wanna tell me about it?

17:42.168 --> 17:44.329
<i>An hour and two hankies later</i>

17:44.404 --> 17:48.170
<i>I found out Mrs. Sellmeyer suspected</i>
<i>her husband was having an affair.</i>

17:48.741 --> 17:50.436
<i>I was lucky T.C.</i>
<i>Had offered to help.</i>

17:50.510 --> 17:54.071
<i>I just hoped Kendall wouldn't be</i>
<i>too upset that I wasn't there.</i>

17:55.481 --> 17:57.540
Actually,
it's a great relief.

17:57.617 --> 17:59.778
You're sure you don't mind?
Nope.

18:00.286 --> 18:03.414
With Magnum gone, at least I can
rehearse without fear of collision.

18:15.034 --> 18:16.228
Right over there.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.116
Are you sure you
don't want something else?

18:38.191 --> 18:40.455
Some dessert,
some carrot cake?

18:40.526 --> 18:43.586
I didn't get to be 106 pounds
eating carrot cake.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.990
I trust that the meal
was satisfactory, Miss Chase.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.865
I personally chose the carrots
and broccoli for their freshness.

18:50.937 --> 18:52.598
Everything was
absolutely delicious.

18:52.672 --> 18:55.300
Thank you, but I have to go
work some of this off.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.468
If you'll excuse me,
I must take a walk.

19:02.415 --> 19:03.712
The camera.

19:03.783 --> 19:05.910
Oh, I can't. I'm on duty.

19:05.985 --> 19:09.045
I have to go out and make sure she's
not attacked by some wild beast.

19:09.122 --> 19:10.851
Like the kudu buck.

19:12.225 --> 19:15.717
There's nothing out there
to harm her, except water.

19:16.963 --> 19:19.761
Yes, and that
she can turn to ice.

19:32.578 --> 19:34.375
How did rehearsal go?

19:35.214 --> 19:36.340
Fine.

19:38.885 --> 19:40.512
Did you miss me?

19:44.624 --> 19:47.616
I don't know very much about ballet,
but I'll tell you something,

19:47.693 --> 19:50.594
I've always admired anyone
who can do that kind of stuff.

19:51.831 --> 19:53.093
Stuff?

19:53.232 --> 19:54.961
Yeah, you know what I mean.

19:55.868 --> 19:58.302
Look, I don't discuss my work

19:58.371 --> 20:01.898
with anyone who doesn't have a
sincere appreciation for the art.

20:01.974 --> 20:04.272
So, please,
don't patronize me.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.480
Oh, I'm not trying
to patronize you, Ms. Chase.

20:11.551 --> 20:13.109
I'm trying
to make you miserable.

20:13.186 --> 20:15.313
I'm trying
to bore you to tears.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.946
I want you
to always remember me

20:17.023 --> 20:19.821
as the one who single-handedly
made your trip to Hawaii

20:19.892 --> 20:21.655
the biggest disappointment
of your life.

20:21.727 --> 20:24.059
Well, at least you're
succeeding at something.

20:24.931 --> 20:26.091
You know somethin'?

20:26.165 --> 20:27.632
You're no great shakes,
honey.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.533
People may like to watch you
tippy-toe around the stage,

20:30.603 --> 20:34.095
but I'll you somethin' if they ever
met you, they'd be damn disappointed.

20:35.374 --> 20:37.808
Furthermore,
you walk like a duck.

20:39.645 --> 20:41.078
What did you say?

20:41.147 --> 20:43.172
I said you walk like a duck.

20:43.249 --> 20:44.614
Is that so?

20:46.786 --> 20:49.550
Well, let's see
how good you do

20:49.622 --> 20:52.182
after walking like this
for 25 years.

20:52.625 --> 20:55.185
Okay? Now, walk, honey.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.629
Are you gonna let go of me,
or am I gonna be forced to hurt you?

21:48.548 --> 21:51.312
I didn't know you knew
how to laugh at yourself.

21:51.384 --> 21:53.818
I'm very used
to taking criticism.

21:54.487 --> 21:57.012
You know, it's just
comparisons to ducks.

21:57.089 --> 21:59.922
Now, that, I really have
to draw the line.

22:00.726 --> 22:02.193
Tell me something.

22:02.261 --> 22:05.094
Do you always
start relationships this way?

22:05.264 --> 22:07.562
Only with people
I finally like.

22:08.734 --> 22:10.224
No, it's true.

22:10.536 --> 22:12.231
Last month,
when I was in Moscow

22:12.305 --> 22:13.863
I had a...

22:13.940 --> 22:16.636
an affair with
an American correspondent.

22:16.776 --> 22:19.301
But our introduction
was unprintable.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.649
It's a hell of a way
to start a relationship.

22:23.849 --> 22:25.680
Well, I don't really...

22:26.018 --> 22:27.986
I don't really
have relationships.

22:28.054 --> 22:29.419
I just have

22:29.889 --> 22:31.322
romantic times.

22:31.390 --> 22:34.325
I fly in and dance,
and then I fly out again.

22:35.161 --> 22:36.253
It's too bad, too,

22:36.329 --> 22:38.297
because I really liked Steven.
He was...

22:38.364 --> 22:40.628
Well, I missed him
when I left.

22:41.734 --> 22:44.464
Sounds like it could
get a little lonely.

22:44.737 --> 22:47.069
The loneliness
doesn't bother me.

22:47.406 --> 22:50.341
It's something...
it's something else that frightens me.

22:50.409 --> 22:51.933
A kind of, um,

22:52.144 --> 22:53.270
emptiness.

22:53.346 --> 22:55.974
That's what gives me
sleepless nights.

22:56.649 --> 22:58.048
So I work until I drop,

22:58.117 --> 23:00.711
and then I yell
at a lot of people and,

23:00.886 --> 23:03.878
and then I don't worry
about sleepless nights.

23:06.592 --> 23:08.719
Do you want to get
some wine?

23:09.595 --> 23:10.926
You drink?

23:11.464 --> 23:12.624
More than I should.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.879
You go back
to the house.

23:28.948 --> 23:30.813
Go on, I wanna
check this out.

23:30.883 --> 23:32.145
Go ahead.

23:42.428 --> 23:43.417
<i>I know.</i>

23:43.496 --> 23:46.954
<i>Instinct told me that the</i>
<i>body was some kind of a trap.</i>

23:47.133 --> 23:49.761
<i>But I had a feeling</i>
<i>I'd have to walk into the trap</i>

23:49.835 --> 23:52.269
<i>in order to keep Kendall</i>
<i>out of it.</i>

24:13.492 --> 24:14.481
Help!

24:18.531 --> 24:19.589
Ooh!

24:25.471 --> 24:27.598
Higgins! Help!

24:34.046 --> 24:35.377
Higgins!

24:40.019 --> 24:41.680
Higgins!

24:47.393 --> 24:48.382
Oh.

24:49.061 --> 24:50.358
Ah.

24:53.065 --> 24:54.396
I say, Magnum,

24:55.034 --> 24:56.160
are you both all right?

24:56.235 --> 24:57.327
Yes.

25:07.580 --> 25:08.911
He's dead.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.670
What do you mean,
Kaholo couldn't get me out?

25:32.138 --> 25:33.662
Look, he tried everything.

25:33.739 --> 25:35.036
Do you want the info?

25:35.107 --> 25:37.439
I thought his specialty was
getting people out of jail.

25:37.510 --> 25:39.603
Thomas, it is.
Kaholo tried everything.

25:39.678 --> 25:40.906
He called
all his friends

25:40.980 --> 25:42.345
and even those
who owed him favors.

25:42.415 --> 25:43.677
Then how come
I'm still here?

25:44.850 --> 25:47.284
The word must have come
from very high up.

25:47.353 --> 25:49.685
Do you want to know the
skinny on the stiff or not?

25:49.755 --> 25:50.779
Yes.

25:50.856 --> 25:51.845
One thing for sure

25:51.924 --> 25:53.414
is the guy wasn't here
to retire.

25:53.492 --> 25:55.153
He was carrying
a temporary visa

25:55.227 --> 25:57.422
and a lot of
foreign currency.

25:57.696 --> 26:00.358
He had a Norwegian passport
that looked very authentic.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.560
I think maybe
too authentic.

26:05.905 --> 26:07.668
Sounds like a spook.

26:07.807 --> 26:09.035
No.

26:09.108 --> 26:11.269
The guy's a big zero,
that's for sure.

26:11.343 --> 26:12.674
Maybe KGB.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.178
Now, why do you
say that?

26:14.246 --> 26:17.238
Kendall said something about being
on a tour in Moscow recently.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.072
Yeah.

26:19.151 --> 26:21.551
Maybe something went down
while she was there.

26:21.620 --> 26:24.487
Sounds like something
is still coming down.

26:24.690 --> 26:26.385
It's time to go.

26:29.628 --> 26:30.925
You, too.

26:46.412 --> 26:48.437
Sign the receipt,
she'll give you back your property.

26:48.514 --> 26:49.503
Thank you.

26:49.582 --> 26:50.947
Oh, Magnum.

26:52.117 --> 26:53.846
No striped pajamas?

26:54.086 --> 26:55.747
No ball and chain?

26:55.921 --> 26:57.445
Actually, I expected
to see you

26:57.556 --> 26:59.148
working on license plates by now.

26:59.225 --> 27:00.385
That's very funny,
Higgins.

27:00.459 --> 27:02.154
Did you come all the
way to tell me that?

27:02.228 --> 27:03.422
Oh, heavens, no.

27:03.496 --> 27:04.520
Although I must admit,

27:04.597 --> 27:06.462
the pleasure derived from
you being behind bars

27:06.532 --> 27:08.727
almost makes the journey
worthwhile.

27:10.769 --> 27:13.203
Actually, uh,
I came to fetch you home,

27:13.272 --> 27:14.899
as you Yanks say.

27:15.274 --> 27:17.139
Well, at least
they're letting me out.

27:17.209 --> 27:18.676
Incredible, isn't it?

27:19.245 --> 27:20.542
That's great, Higgins.

27:20.613 --> 27:22.638
Now, just how
did you do it?

27:22.781 --> 27:24.373
Mr. Masters' attorney did it.

27:24.450 --> 27:26.918
He has considerably
more clout than your, uh,

27:26.986 --> 27:28.715
what's the term,
uh, mouthpiece.

27:28.787 --> 27:31.085
How did Robin know
I was in jail?

27:31.156 --> 27:34.421
Lucia Prince called him
on Miss Chase's insistence.

27:36.462 --> 27:38.054
Thanks, Higgins.

27:39.164 --> 27:40.563
Oh, Magnum,

27:41.300 --> 27:44.326
I hope you didn't mind
the accommodations too much

27:44.403 --> 27:47.804
because if Mr. Masters' camera
isn't returned in 24 hours

27:47.873 --> 27:49.534
you shall be back.

27:51.076 --> 27:52.407
Of course.

28:02.054 --> 28:03.988
<i>There was no way</i>
<i>for me to confirm</i>

28:04.056 --> 28:05.785
<i>the two men at the estate</i>
<i>as KGB agents.</i>

28:05.858 --> 28:07.826
<i>So I wasn't even gonna try.</i>

28:07.893 --> 28:10.157
<i>Instead, I was gonna try</i>
<i>and come up with a reason</i>

28:10.229 --> 28:12.254
<i>for the KGB</i>
<i>to be after Kendall.</i>

28:12.331 --> 28:13.593
<i>And for that,</i>

28:13.666 --> 28:15.497
<i>I'd need MacReynolds' help.</i>

28:16.035 --> 28:17.297
<i>It wouldn't be easy,</i>
<i>but I figured</i>

28:17.369 --> 28:19.303
<i>I could probably</i>
<i>talk him into it.</i>

28:19.672 --> 28:20.661
<i>Like T.C. Said,</i>

28:20.739 --> 28:23.731
<i>you just gotta know</i>
<i>how to handle some people.</i>

28:26.679 --> 28:28.613
Magnum. What are you...

28:29.248 --> 28:31.341
Oh, no, you don't.

28:31.417 --> 28:33.009
I don't suppose
you came all the way

28:33.085 --> 28:34.450
to bring me doughnuts, huh?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.488
Well, Mac, I was just
in the neighborhood,

28:36.589 --> 28:38.580
and I thought you might
like some goodies.

28:38.657 --> 28:40.352
Just to get
the old heart started.

28:41.527 --> 28:43.688
You know, Thomas,
this is your worst one yet.

28:43.762 --> 28:45.525
I mean it,
this is the worst. Huh?

28:45.598 --> 28:47.725
To think that you could
get information out of me

28:47.800 --> 28:49.358
by conning me with, uh,

28:49.435 --> 28:51.198
jelly rolls, uh,

28:51.270 --> 28:52.259
an eclair...

28:52.338 --> 28:53.965
These are jelly filled, too.

28:54.039 --> 28:56.439
And these eclairs,
they're just great.

28:58.043 --> 28:59.271
That's so dumb.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.641
Besides, I'm on a diet.

29:01.714 --> 29:03.306
Oh, Mac.

29:04.216 --> 29:05.376
I'm sorry.

29:05.451 --> 29:08.477
You know, I would have brought
you some fruit or something

29:08.554 --> 29:11.455
if I knew you were trying
to drop a few lbs.

29:11.991 --> 29:13.822
Do you have to eat that
right in front of me?

29:13.892 --> 29:15.325
Hmm? Sorry.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.830
Mac, you know,

29:20.466 --> 29:22.024
it was really stupid

29:22.101 --> 29:24.228
to think that
the doughnuts would work.

29:24.303 --> 29:26.533
But I promise you,
there's nothing,

29:26.605 --> 29:28.766
absolutely nothing,
top secret about this one.

29:28.841 --> 29:30.240
I just need
a little information

29:30.309 --> 29:32.402
about a correspondent
in Moscow.

29:32.478 --> 29:33.536
Mmm.

29:33.712 --> 29:35.304
His name
is Steven something.

29:35.381 --> 29:37.008
Now, I know
you guys keep records

29:37.082 --> 29:38.982
of press people abroad.

29:39.051 --> 29:41.383
I just need a little background
information. That's all.

29:41.453 --> 29:42.818
Why don't you
call his editor?

29:42.888 --> 29:44.913
I would
if I knew who he was.

29:44.990 --> 29:46.787
Come on, Mac, please.

29:49.294 --> 29:51.159
This is so dumb.
I know.

29:54.166 --> 29:55.758
What's his name?

29:56.835 --> 29:58.029
Steven.

29:58.203 --> 29:59.397
Steven?

30:05.010 --> 30:06.102
Dumb.

30:15.054 --> 30:16.146
Kendall?

30:16.221 --> 30:17.449
I'm sorry.

30:17.523 --> 30:18.581
I can't talk now.

30:18.657 --> 30:20.215
I'm really... I'm really
getting somewhere.

30:20.292 --> 30:22.021
Well, we've got to.

30:22.561 --> 30:24.893
I know this sounds crazy but, uh,

30:26.065 --> 30:28.499
I think the Soviets
are after you.

30:30.536 --> 30:33.835
I think you must have me
confused with Baryshnikov.

30:34.306 --> 30:36.171
Tom, I really
appreciate everything

30:36.241 --> 30:38.072
that you did last night.

30:38.143 --> 30:40.611
But, if you're here
to talk about it,

30:40.679 --> 30:42.044
I really can't help you.

30:42.114 --> 30:43.513
I have to perform tonight

30:43.582 --> 30:45.106
and if I even think about
last night,

30:45.184 --> 30:47.277
I'm not gonna be able
to do that.

30:47.352 --> 30:49.877
Okay, we won't
talk about that.

30:49.955 --> 30:51.445
Let's talk about
the correspondent

30:51.523 --> 30:53.957
you met in Moscow,
Steven Sanders.

30:54.426 --> 30:55.757
What about him?

30:55.828 --> 30:57.295
Tell me what you did,
where you went,

30:57.362 --> 30:59.193
what you talked about.
Anything.

30:59.598 --> 31:01.225
We spent the night
together.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.894
And you want to try
to figure that out?

31:10.409 --> 31:12.877
How did you find out
his last name?

31:13.979 --> 31:15.310
I don't remember
telling you.

31:15.380 --> 31:16.574
The Steven was enough.

31:16.648 --> 31:18.411
I just checked him out.

31:18.484 --> 31:19.712
Kendall,

31:20.319 --> 31:22.082
he was a U.S. Agent.

31:23.722 --> 31:24.916
Agent?

31:25.157 --> 31:26.647
Like in spy?

31:27.192 --> 31:28.659
That's right.

31:40.606 --> 31:43.040
Now, you want to tell me
about him?

31:46.779 --> 31:48.770
We met
at a press conference.

31:48.847 --> 31:50.576
He was covering the tour.

31:50.649 --> 31:51.980
We had coffee a few times

31:52.050 --> 31:53.984
over interviews
and such.

31:54.052 --> 31:56.077
The last night
I was there,

31:56.455 --> 31:58.116
I stayed with him.

31:59.224 --> 32:01.488
Tell me about
the day you left.

32:02.594 --> 32:03.993
I woke up
in the morning,

32:04.062 --> 32:05.654
and he'd left me a note

32:05.731 --> 32:07.289
saying that he'd meet me
at the airport

32:07.366 --> 32:08.355
to say goodbye.

32:08.433 --> 32:09.695
He had to go do
an interview.

32:09.768 --> 32:11.065
But he never got
to the airport,

32:11.136 --> 32:13.161
and I never saw him
again.

32:14.973 --> 32:16.440
Oh, this is silly.

32:16.508 --> 32:18.874
And he must've had
a lot of other girlfriends.

32:18.944 --> 32:21.276
W- what would anyone
want with me?

32:22.648 --> 32:26.209
Because I think you were the
last person to see him alive.

32:29.354 --> 32:30.651
He was killed

32:30.722 --> 32:32.121
in an auto accident.

32:32.191 --> 32:35.092
That's why he never
showed up at the airport.

32:36.795 --> 32:38.353
I have to practice.

32:38.463 --> 32:39.691
Kendall.

33:27.646 --> 33:29.739
<i>I asked T.C.</i>
<i>To come stay with Kendall</i>

33:29.815 --> 33:31.806
<i>and headed for</i>
<i>Mrs. Sellmeyer's house.</i>

33:31.884 --> 33:33.818
<i>Not just to work on her case,</i>

33:33.886 --> 33:35.615
<i>but to work on Kendall's also.</i>

33:35.687 --> 33:39.179
<i>That little voice inside was</i>
<i>telling me the two were related.</i>

33:39.258 --> 33:41.158
<i>I just didn't know how.</i>

33:45.664 --> 33:46.790
<i>I had a funny feeling</i>

33:46.865 --> 33:48.833
<i>about Mrs. Sellmeyer</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

33:48.901 --> 33:51.768
<i>Being alone in her house</i>
<i>only confirmed it.</i>

33:52.104 --> 33:53.435
<i>Kendall was caught</i>
<i>in the middle</i>

33:53.505 --> 33:54.802
<i>of some big league hardball</i>

33:54.873 --> 33:56.568
<i>and since I used to play</i>
<i>in that league</i>

33:56.642 --> 33:58.337
<i>I recognized</i>
<i>some of their technique,</i>

33:58.410 --> 34:00.435
<i>like diversionary tactics.</i>

34:00.812 --> 34:01.904
<i>It suddenly occurred to me</i>

34:01.980 --> 34:05.416
<i>that $750 a day</i>
<i>was a very good diversion.</i>

35:04.042 --> 35:06.510
<i>When I saw the airline ticket</i>
<i>for Washington, D.C.</i>

35:06.578 --> 35:08.739
<i>I got another funny feeling.</i>

35:09.081 --> 35:12.380
<i>I was also intrigued by the</i>
<i>phone number on the travel slip.</i>

35:12.451 --> 35:14.112
<i>I'd worked in NIA long enough</i>

35:14.186 --> 35:17.349
<i>to recognize the area code</i>
<i>for Langley, Virginia.</i>

35:17.456 --> 35:20.755
<i>And there was only one thing</i>
<i>in Langley of any significance.</i>

35:20.826 --> 35:23.317
<i>Central Intelligence Agency.</i>

35:59.131 --> 36:00.359
Magnum.

36:01.166 --> 36:03.259
What are you doing in here?

36:03.736 --> 36:06.170
Oh, one of the servants
let me in.

36:07.573 --> 36:09.438
I don't have any servants.

36:09.508 --> 36:11.806
You don't have
a husband either.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.741
What do you want?

36:16.849 --> 36:18.009
Oh, some answers.

36:18.083 --> 36:19.209
Like what happened
to Kendall

36:19.284 --> 36:20.410
in the Soviet Union?

36:20.486 --> 36:23.080
Why the CIA doesn't
want me in the picture?

36:23.155 --> 36:26.283
You know, that was real cute
trying to keep me in jail.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.451
I'm afraid
I can't tell you.

36:28.627 --> 36:30.026
Oh, really?

36:31.063 --> 36:33.691
Fine. I'll just give
<i>The Washington Post</i> a call.

36:33.766 --> 36:35.097
I don't want to,

36:35.167 --> 36:36.156
but I will.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.964
Magnum, this is
a critical operation.

36:38.037 --> 36:39.334
A lot is riding on it.

36:39.405 --> 36:40.463
Then I'm sure

36:40.539 --> 36:42.632
you don't want them
to know about it.

36:42.708 --> 36:44.801
All right, I'll tell you
what's going on,

36:44.877 --> 36:46.139
if you stay
out of the way.

36:46.211 --> 36:47.337
Deal?

36:52.351 --> 36:54.717
Kendall was the last person
to see one of our agents

36:54.787 --> 36:56.049
who had
a high level connection

36:56.121 --> 36:57.213
in the Soviet government.

36:57.289 --> 36:58.847
Our man's cover
was slipping.

36:58.924 --> 37:00.858
The Soviets wouldn't
do anything about it

37:00.926 --> 37:02.621
until they knew
who the connection was.

37:02.695 --> 37:05.493
Unfortunately, we lost
our man unexpectedly.

37:05.564 --> 37:07.156
So the Soviets think

37:07.232 --> 37:08.893
that he blew his cover

37:08.967 --> 37:10.127
to Kendall?

37:10.202 --> 37:11.226
No.

37:11.470 --> 37:12.664
They think he told her

37:12.738 --> 37:14.205
where he was going
the day he died.

37:14.273 --> 37:16.639
That information would
give them our connection.

37:16.709 --> 37:18.734
Then why the hell
aren't you protecting her?

37:18.811 --> 37:21.211
Why are you trying
to pull me off?

37:23.849 --> 37:25.339
It's a setup.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.651
You want her to get caught.

37:28.721 --> 37:30.086
She's got
the wrong information.

37:30.155 --> 37:31.554
Magnum,
we had a deal.

37:31.623 --> 37:33.386
You had a deal.
Magnum.

37:34.727 --> 37:37.321
This is a matter
of national security.

37:37.963 --> 37:38.987
Oh, isn't it always.

37:39.064 --> 37:40.122
It's going down
right now

37:40.199 --> 37:41.996
and nothing is going
to happen to her.

37:42.067 --> 37:44.262
We're on top of this operation
all the way.

37:44.336 --> 37:45.701
Well, I've been
on your operations

37:45.771 --> 37:47.705
and somehow,
I don't have a lot of faith in them.

37:47.773 --> 37:48.933
Magnum.

37:49.975 --> 37:51.966
You really gonna
shoot me?

38:23.842 --> 38:26.310
Here comes
one of the Russians now.

38:28.847 --> 38:30.337
Moving towards you.

38:30.415 --> 38:31.609
Roger.

38:43.962 --> 38:46.123
I can see the other one now.

38:51.770 --> 38:53.465
They're on their way.

38:53.772 --> 38:55.433
Now, look, Elaine,
don't worry about Magnum.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.031
I don't think
he'll get here in time.

38:57.109 --> 38:58.167
<i>Keep me informed.</i>

38:58.243 --> 38:59.733
Yeah. Will do.

38:59.812 --> 39:01.006
<i>What about Magnum?</i>

39:01.079 --> 39:02.944
We'll worry about
him when he gets here.

39:03.015 --> 39:04.277
Go take out the Black guy,

39:04.349 --> 39:06.283
and then report back to me
here in the van.

39:06.952 --> 39:08.146
Roger.

39:22.034 --> 39:23.058
<i>Bravo.</i>

39:23.135 --> 39:25.103
<i>Bravo. Bravo.</i>

39:25.170 --> 39:27.468
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.201
I'm very glad that this
stage is as big as it is.

39:30.275 --> 39:32.038
I'm always worried
about leaping

39:32.110 --> 39:34.442
right into
the conductor's baton.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.036
Or worse yet,
his lap.

39:38.550 --> 39:41.144
You know, this is my favorite
part of performance nights.

39:41.220 --> 39:42.915
Sitting on the stage,

39:42.988 --> 39:44.649
in an empty hall.

39:45.357 --> 39:46.984
It's so peaceful.

39:47.693 --> 39:50.423
But there's something
in the air, some

39:50.495 --> 39:52.827
energy from
the night before, uh,

39:52.998 --> 39:55.523
anticipation for the night to come.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.068
It's theater.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.960
I can smell it.

39:59.738 --> 40:01.706
It gives me goose bumps.

40:02.674 --> 40:04.699
Dancing may be very lonely,

40:04.776 --> 40:06.437
and it may be hard

40:06.912 --> 40:09.210
but I'd die
if I couldn't do it.

40:11.783 --> 40:13.774
That must be Thomas.

40:23.262 --> 40:25.457
Hey, Tom,
it's about time you...

40:26.365 --> 40:27.992
Move. Move. Move.

40:30.002 --> 40:31.196
Inside.

40:31.837 --> 40:33.099
Let's go.

40:42.981 --> 40:44.073
T.C.?

40:48.353 --> 40:49.411
T.C.?

40:55.560 --> 40:56.652
T.C.!

40:57.195 --> 41:00.028
<i>We don't want to hurt you,</i>
<i>Miss Chase.</i>

41:01.600 --> 41:04.433
<i>We only want you</i>
<i>to answer some questions.</i>

41:04.803 --> 41:06.862
But the light,
it's... it's hurting my eyes.

41:06.939 --> 41:08.338
I can't see.

41:11.043 --> 41:12.510
What do you want?

41:12.577 --> 41:14.670
<i>On your last day in Moscow</i>

41:14.746 --> 41:18.238
<i>your friend Steven Sanders</i>
<i>went somewhere on an errand.</i>

41:18.517 --> 41:20.109
<i>Where did he go?</i>

41:21.653 --> 41:23.120
I don't know.

41:24.856 --> 41:27.620
I don't... I don't know
any Steven Sanders.

41:31.163 --> 41:32.323
Hello?

41:37.602 --> 41:38.591
Hello?

41:38.870 --> 41:39.859
Ah.

41:50.482 --> 41:51.608
Okay?

41:54.052 --> 41:55.314
<i>Miss Chase,</i>

41:55.387 --> 41:59.255
<i>my country greatly appreciates</i>
<i>the art at which you excel.</i>

42:00.158 --> 42:02.183
<i>It would be a pity</i>
<i>if you were not able</i>

42:02.260 --> 42:04.854
<i>to continue excelling</i>
<i>in that art.</i>

42:07.799 --> 42:08.925
<i>Now,</i>

42:09.001 --> 42:11.299
<i>where did Mr. Sanders go?</i>

42:13.505 --> 42:14.494
Magnum.

42:36.461 --> 42:38.019
Out of the car.

43:06.825 --> 43:08.793
I'm trying to remember.
Honest.

43:08.894 --> 43:10.555
I, uh...

43:12.264 --> 43:14.129
I think it was
one of the ministries.

43:16.601 --> 43:17.898
No, I'm sure it was.

43:17.969 --> 43:19.937
It was the Ministry
of... of Culture.

43:20.272 --> 43:21.933
No, no, Agriculture.

43:22.007 --> 43:24.498
It was
the Ministry of Agriculture.

43:24.943 --> 43:26.501
I'm sure of it.

43:26.645 --> 43:27.873
Please.

43:29.014 --> 43:31.039
You hurt her,
you're dead.

43:42.494 --> 43:44.394
Kendall, you all right?

43:59.911 --> 44:01.401
You all right?

44:01.813 --> 44:03.075
You okay?

44:03.982 --> 44:05.313
It's over.

44:19.431 --> 44:21.058
Did you get 'em?

44:21.633 --> 44:23.191
They weren't
the objective.

44:24.236 --> 44:25.931
Congratulations, guys.

44:42.687 --> 44:44.655
Took me awhile to break the lock.
Is she okay?

44:44.723 --> 44:45.712
Yeah, how about you?

44:45.790 --> 44:47.121
I'm okay. I'm sorry.

44:47.192 --> 44:49.456
Don't worry about it.
As long as you're all right.

44:59.604 --> 45:02.232
There's gonna be a lot of
disappointed fans out there.

45:02.307 --> 45:04.002
Starting with T.C.

45:04.309 --> 45:05.606
It's only gonna be
six months.

45:05.677 --> 45:07.440
I'm sure they'll survive.

45:07.512 --> 45:08.774
Will you?

45:09.114 --> 45:10.479
You're looking
at the girl

45:10.549 --> 45:13.518
who single-handedly
took on the KGB and the CIA.

45:13.685 --> 45:16.051
I'm a rock.
I'm a pillar of strength.

45:16.121 --> 45:17.247
I'm a liar.

45:17.322 --> 45:19.187
I'll probably go nuts.

45:19.691 --> 45:21.921
I know it's gonna be
very difficult.

45:21.993 --> 45:24.757
Like standing on toe shoes
for the first time.

45:24.829 --> 45:27.354
It's gonna take some
getting used to.

45:27.799 --> 45:29.733
But I have
to take the time.

45:29.801 --> 45:31.701
If they had cut my leg

45:32.771 --> 45:35.501
my life, as I've known it,
would be over.

45:36.007 --> 45:38.237
There has to be
more to that life besides

45:38.310 --> 45:39.675
just work.

45:40.145 --> 45:42.238
I need to find out
who Kendall Chase is

45:42.314 --> 45:44.009
besides the dancer.

45:45.150 --> 45:48.313
I need to find out if she's
someone I'd even like.

45:48.653 --> 45:50.177
I think she is.

46:33.031 --> 46:34.965
Thomas, I got it.

46:38.703 --> 46:39.692
At a discount?

46:39.771 --> 46:40.897
$1,700.

46:40.972 --> 46:42.337
$1,700?

46:42.407 --> 46:44.068
Thomas,
it's worth twice that.

46:44.142 --> 46:45.541
I know that.

46:47.979 --> 46:49.742
It isn't hot, is it?

46:50.582 --> 46:51.776
Thomas.

46:52.284 --> 46:53.808
Ah, Magnum.

46:53.885 --> 46:55.409
I see you've got the camera.

46:55.487 --> 46:57.284
Yes, Higgins.

46:58.523 --> 46:59.581
Huh.

47:00.625 --> 47:02.354
With all the lenses

47:03.061 --> 47:04.585
safe and sound.

47:06.665 --> 47:08.189
500 mm lens.

47:08.300 --> 47:10.598
Yes, it is, Higgins.
It's worth $3,500.

47:10.669 --> 47:12.660
$3,550, actually.

47:13.204 --> 47:14.637
It's strange.

47:14.706 --> 47:18.073
Robin lost the 500 mm lens
the last time he was here.

47:19.644 --> 47:22.579
I hadn't realized
he'd replaced it.

47:27.652 --> 47:29.176
Robin lost it?

47:29.321 --> 47:31.221
Yes. You know, Magnum,

47:31.623 --> 47:33.318
I thought you were
trying to avoid

47:33.391 --> 47:35.882
returning this equipment
because, well, you'd, uh,

47:35.960 --> 47:38.190
lost or broken something.

47:38.263 --> 47:41.198
I was quite wrong,
and I owe you an apology.

47:42.000 --> 47:42.989
Ta.

47:44.602 --> 47:45.967
Thank you.
