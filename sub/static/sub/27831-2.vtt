WEBVTT

00:12.220 --> 00:13.221
G'morning.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.567
G'morning.

00:41.499 --> 00:42.792
What are you doing?

00:44.836 --> 00:45.920
This is mine.

00:49.674 --> 00:50.717
I'm sorry.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.596
Um...

00:55.180 --> 00:56.056
where is mine?

00:56.222 --> 00:57.057
Huh?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.977
I just don't remember where I put mine.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.605
What're you going on about?
You don't have one.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.857
Get out of here already.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.736
Fixing your hair
won't fix your face anyway.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.232
Dammit.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.650
Why?

01:49.317 --> 01:51.319
Do you want me

01:51.653 --> 01:53.404
to reveal your secret to Koshiro?

01:53.696 --> 01:54.697
Zenko Umine.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.495
<i>My face, my hair, my voice, my clothes...</i>

02:00.829 --> 02:02.539
<i>Despite everything being the same,</i>

02:04.582 --> 02:07.001
<i>why am I still different from</i>
<i>Ayumi Kohinata?</i>

02:10.880 --> 02:14.425
AKATSUKI HIGH SCHOOL FESTIVAL

02:18.221 --> 02:19.055
Ayumi. Ayumi!

02:36.781 --> 02:37.866
Koshiro.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.075
Good morning.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.368
Can we talk?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.122
<i>Kaga...</i>

02:45.206 --> 02:46.082
<i>Did he...?</i>

02:49.043 --> 02:50.295
What's wrong?

02:51.296 --> 02:52.589
Tell me, Koshiro.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.927
I wanted to be alone with you.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.513
What?

03:11.065 --> 03:11.900
Ayumi,

03:13.193 --> 03:14.027
are you afraid?

03:22.118 --> 03:22.994
No...

03:24.996 --> 03:28.374
Nothing scares me when I'm with you.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.383
-Hey!
-Ow!

03:38.176 --> 03:39.552
Kaga.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.012
You'd make a great ghost.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.850
What's with the long face?

03:46.267 --> 03:47.101
Hey. It's said

03:50.355 --> 03:54.192
that human cells die one after another
every day.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.403
After 200 days, all of your cells
are replaced by new ones.

03:58.446 --> 04:01.157
If I stay like this
for more than 200 days,

04:02.033 --> 04:03.284
I wonder if my body

04:04.118 --> 04:06.120
will become Zenko Umine's entirely.

04:13.127 --> 04:16.172
I don't get these things,
so I had my sister pick this out.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.050
-Hey! Watch the zits.
-There you go.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.260
Seems okay.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.594
Look.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.267
See? Not bad.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.352
I definitely like this more.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.645
What?

04:33.648 --> 04:35.275
No, I just meant...

04:35.566 --> 04:37.819
I didn't mean "like" as in...

04:38.486 --> 04:40.488
It's the same as saying
"I like sweets"--

04:40.571 --> 04:41.447
Kaga. Thanks.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.163
No prob.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.543
I'm really, really glad we're friends.

04:58.631 --> 04:59.674
Just friends...

05:01.843 --> 05:02.677
What's wrong?

05:03.636 --> 05:04.512
It's nothing.

05:10.143 --> 05:10.977
That hurts!

05:11.185 --> 05:13.187
<i>Even if it's only one person,</i>

05:13.771 --> 05:16.816
<i>the whole world shifts when they see you.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:19.402
That really hurt!

05:19.861 --> 05:23.448
<i>The person who pulled me out</i>
<i>from the dark and intoÂ the light</i>

05:25.033 --> 05:28.036
<i>was none other... than Kaga.</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:30.848
AYUMI KOHINATA

06:31.974 --> 06:32.809
ZENKO UMINE

06:38.940 --> 06:41.442
It'd be nice if you could
naturally return to your body.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.696
Why did it get switched
in the first place?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.283
If you knew that,
then you could switch back.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.746
When Umine fell off that building,
I think that's what set things in motion.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.915
Then try diving off a building, too.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.000
That's not funny.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.419
Sorry.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.962
PARROT FOUND

07:01.045 --> 07:02.630
But she's lucky.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.632
-Who is?
-Umine.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.552
If you didn't switch, she'd be dead.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.187
It wasn't a coincidence.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.814
Huh?

07:21.315 --> 07:22.900
Umine knew already

07:23.151 --> 07:24.360
that we'd change places.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.366
Morning, Ayumi!

07:30.867 --> 07:33.244
Hey, let's go check out
class four's maid cafe.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.914
How can you be so normal?

07:38.666 --> 07:40.460
After what happened yesterday.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.004
Umine's been harassing Ayumi.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.506
Everyone, I'm sorry.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.383
I misunderstood

07:48.426 --> 07:50.178
Umine.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.472
But you just misunderstood, right? -Everyone makes mistakes. Right?
-Yeah.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.060
<i>They're acting like they're angels,</i>

07:59.020 --> 08:01.856
<i>but inside they're laughing at me,</i>
<i>aren't they?</i>

08:02.857 --> 08:04.025
Who cares?

08:05.526 --> 08:06.360
Ayumi? Let's go.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.452
Do not speak to any other girls.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.121
All right.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.713
Hello...

08:26.964 --> 08:27.882
Kohinata.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.469
I want to talk to you.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.642
THE CURSED HOUSE

08:37.725 --> 08:39.560
PRE-OPENING

08:41.270 --> 08:42.104
Whoa!

08:43.564 --> 08:45.274
Captain!

08:45.358 --> 08:47.693
Here! Lead us well, Captain.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.403
I'm getting fired up!

08:49.987 --> 08:50.863
I'll do my best!

08:50.988 --> 08:51.822
Please do!

08:52.073 --> 08:53.824
Your captain is here!

08:53.908 --> 08:55.576
Kaga!

08:55.660 --> 08:56.786
-We're here.
-Thanks.

08:56.869 --> 09:01.165
As captain, I specially present to you
front-of-the-line passes.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.543
Hey, that's unfair!

09:03.626 --> 09:05.002
Give me one, too!

09:05.878 --> 09:06.963
No! Go line up.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.216
Captain, you've got a stick up your butt!

09:11.050 --> 09:13.678
-He took it like a man. How classy.
-You jerk!

09:17.723 --> 09:19.350
Koshiro, save me.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.060
Kaga, we need to talk.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.525
Please, Umine.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.902
I want you to tell me.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.239
Tell you what?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.117
How to change back.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.413
How should I know?

09:41.163 --> 09:41.998
But...

09:42.873 --> 09:44.584
you said it yourself.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.502
That's because

09:47.545 --> 09:49.672
I always wanted to be you.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.301
That was just a coincidence.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.385
No, it wasn't.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.596
What?

09:56.929 --> 09:57.888
If that's the case,

09:58.889 --> 10:00.891
why did you jump off the building
that day? Because you knew we would switch.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.401
So you did know.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.653
I told you I don't know anything.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.988
Wait!

10:16.490 --> 10:18.117
If we can change back now,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.911
Kaga and I will keep all of this a secret.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.872
I won't say a word to Koshiro, either.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.081
So...

10:29.962 --> 10:31.297
What's so funny?

10:33.215 --> 10:34.050
Sorry,

10:34.800 --> 10:36.719
you're just so desperate.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.512
Of course I would be.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.311
I'll tell you out of pity.

10:47.855 --> 10:48.939
Koshiro...

10:50.191 --> 10:51.525
has known for a while.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.739
He knows that we've switched.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.282
Ayumi, are you afraid?

10:59.742 --> 11:03.079
Nothing scares me when I'm with you.

11:03.871 --> 11:04.705
Since when?

11:06.457 --> 11:07.667
When did you switch...

11:08.709 --> 11:09.543
Zenko Umine?

11:11.128 --> 11:13.839
Ayumi is terrified of the dark.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.341
Then what?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.512
What did he say after that?!

11:24.308 --> 11:25.726
He said it's fine like this.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.983
Zenko Umine being Ayumi Kohinata is fine.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.985
That's what he said.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.073
What're you saying?

11:39.156 --> 11:41.450
What I like about Ayumi is her face.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.829
That's why I'm fine with dating Umine.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.373
Cut the crap already.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.709
Do you know how much pain
Ayumi's going through?

11:51.752 --> 11:52.920
Ayumi...

11:54.255 --> 11:56.257
had her body stolen!

12:01.846 --> 12:02.763
In that case,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.183
you help Ayumi.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.604
That's a lie...

12:12.606 --> 12:14.567
You're definitely lying!

12:14.942 --> 12:17.027
Koshiro would never say that.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.281
If that's what you think,

12:20.990 --> 12:22.825
then why don't you go see him now?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.621
What's wrong?

12:29.623 --> 12:30.458
Oh, dear.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.340
That's right.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.594
Koshiro belongs to me now.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.699
<i>She's lying, right?</i>

13:06.619 --> 13:08.621
<i>I can't believe that.</i>

13:10.414 --> 13:11.916
<i>I don't want to believe it.</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:17.254
<i>Koshiro...</i>

13:34.563 --> 13:35.981
I'm sorry about earlier.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.901
I was mean, wasn't I?

13:41.403 --> 13:44.031
No, it's okay. Right?

13:44.406 --> 13:45.241
Yeah.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.039
Also, I have a small favor to ask of you.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.811
Zenko Umine being Ayumi Kohinata is fine.

14:14.436 --> 14:15.437
That's what he said. Umine.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.616
Is something wrong?

14:29.994 --> 14:30.911
Listen,

14:33.247 --> 14:35.332
we're truly sorry about everything.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.046
We just

14:41.797 --> 14:43.883
never gave you an honest apology.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.761
It's okay.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.972
Don't sweat it.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.727
Thanks for saying that, Ritsu.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.314
I mean, Inaki.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.524
And Tsuchiya.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.151
First names are fine.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.238
Can we call you Zenko, too?

15:09.658 --> 15:13.913
I had some really wonderful friends.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.173
Oh, by the way,

15:25.215 --> 15:26.550
this is from Ayumi.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.644
<i>If you can find me by 4:00 p.m.,</i>

15:36.977 --> 15:38.687
<i>I'll teach you how to switch back.</i>

15:39.813 --> 15:40.856
3:45 P.M.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.441
Where is Kohinata now?

15:42.524 --> 15:44.109
She was heading to the courtyard.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.461
Sorry!

16:05.297 --> 16:06.465
Have you seen Kohinata?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.510
She just went back to the classroom.

16:10.761 --> 16:11.971
3:55 P.M.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.745
AKATSUKI HOUSE

16:52.052 --> 16:54.805
<i>Ayumi is terrified of the dark.</i>

17:31.008 --> 17:31.884
Umine?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.859
What I like about Ayumi is her face.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.070
You help Ayumi.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.585
NEW MESSAGE FROM MIZUMOTO

18:30.984 --> 18:31.985
Koshiro!

18:33.195 --> 18:34.696
Koshiro, save me!

18:36.949 --> 18:37.866
Koshiro!

19:03.976 --> 19:05.102
Koshiro...

19:07.646 --> 19:08.689
Ayumi!

19:10.691 --> 19:11.608
Kaga.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.907
Everything is okay now.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.577
Thank you.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.913
She really is scared of it.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.795
I feel better after eating.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.299
Man, I could eat this forever.
Needs more whipped cream next time.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.260
-Hey.
-Yeah?

19:43.348 --> 19:45.350
Now you're being shy?

19:45.434 --> 19:46.727
You want seconds, right?

19:46.810 --> 19:47.978
It's not that.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.147
Huh?

19:51.148 --> 19:52.816
Did you meet up with Koshiro?

19:56.695 --> 20:00.115
I heard from Umine

20:02.701 --> 20:03.744
that Koshiro

20:04.786 --> 20:06.538
-is fine with--
-Dating her.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.749
Right?

20:12.127 --> 20:14.046
You can't take it so literally.

20:15.005 --> 20:19.426
I, for one, don't think
he would ever betray you.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.511
-Because...
-Because?

20:25.641 --> 20:26.975
<i>Go to the classroom now.</i>

20:27.392 --> 20:29.853
<i>Open the curtain when you find Ayumi.</i>

20:38.695 --> 20:41.240
He's always been that kind of person.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.452
Yeah, you're right.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.666
<i>Kaga's words</i>

20:51.208 --> 20:52.542
<i>gave me courage.</i>

20:54.378 --> 20:55.212
I will

20:56.046 --> 20:57.547
go talk to Koshiro.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.595
Have you seen Koshiro?

21:04.513 --> 21:05.472
He's in the art room. Thanks.

21:08.725 --> 21:12.187
<i>Koshiro doesn't hurt people.</i>

21:22.572 --> 21:25.659
<i>I should know that better than anyone.</i>

21:26.451 --> 21:28.620
<i>Why didn't I believe him?</i>

22:03.864 --> 22:04.698
<i>Koshiro,</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i>

22:38.982 --> 22:40.567
Oh, it's just you!

22:41.318 --> 22:42.152
Sorry.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.253
Ayumi!

23:17.646 --> 23:20.565
Ayumi is terrified of the dark.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.155
Wait.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.949
Koshiro, wait!

23:31.910 --> 23:36.123
I risked my life to switch with her.
There's no way I can go back now!

23:36.456 --> 23:39.626
I will become Ayumi Kohinata.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.170
I'll be whoever you want me to be.

23:44.339 --> 23:47.008
I finally became your girlfriend.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.470
Please.

23:51.805 --> 23:52.806
I'm begging you.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.100
Fall in love with me.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.317
That's fine.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.912
Zenko Umine being Ayumi Kohinata is fine.

24:17.164 --> 24:17.998
Why?

24:21.626 --> 24:24.754
Because I didn't care for Ayumi
to begin with.

24:27.132 --> 24:31.219
I've always been better than Kaga
academically and athletically.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.472
Nice shot!

24:33.555 --> 24:36.475
You're first again, Mizumoto?
I even took extra tests.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.559
But...

24:38.518 --> 24:40.353
everyone always gravitated toward Kaga.

24:40.604 --> 24:41.438
Kaga!

24:44.399 --> 24:46.026
You've got a stick up your butt!

24:49.279 --> 24:50.739
He's an eyesore.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.497
I've stolen the one thing he values most.

24:59.664 --> 25:00.499
That's why

25:01.875 --> 25:04.586
I've never had
a shred of feeling for Ayumi.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.231
Stop!

25:26.066 --> 25:28.318
I can't do this anymore.

25:30.403 --> 25:31.821
Don't worry!

25:31.988 --> 25:33.990
I will find a way to get your body back!

25:36.076 --> 25:37.953
It doesn't matter what you look like.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.747
I am on your side!

26:00.058 --> 26:01.685
I want to be Kaga.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.855
I've always wanted to be him.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.113
I want you to tell me

26:13.947 --> 26:15.156
how I can trade places.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.369
You know how I feel, right?

26:26.668 --> 26:27.877
I can't do it right now.

26:30.755 --> 26:31.590
But...

26:34.175 --> 26:40.432
If you have every intention
of falling in love with me,

26:43.018 --> 26:45.228
then I'll consider it.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.358
Okay.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.576
<i>But...</i>

27:00.201 --> 27:02.203
<i>I don't plan on telling him.</i>

27:03.788 --> 27:04.664
<i>Because...</i>

27:05.624 --> 27:07.959
<i>I like Koshiro as he is now.</i>

27:10.837 --> 27:11.880
Let's go.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.553
We would make...

27:19.054 --> 27:21.389
a great fake couple.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.686
Yeah.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.661
Food therapy is a terrific system.

27:43.536 --> 27:44.537
Isn't it convenient?

27:44.704 --> 27:46.831
-You forget all the bad stuff.
-Yeah.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.341
Hey...

27:59.386 --> 28:00.512
will you go out with me?

28:03.223 --> 28:04.057
Sure. Seriously?!

28:06.976 --> 28:09.354
Yeah. I'll go out with you anywhere.

28:09.729 --> 28:10.563
Huh?

28:11.147 --> 28:13.441
I could go for a strawberry parfait next.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.948
You better get ready to be so stuffed,
you'll wanna die!

28:20.031 --> 28:22.283
Ow! That hurts!

28:24.119 --> 28:24.953
<i>I wonder why...</i>

28:25.036 --> 28:26.496
That really hurts!

28:27.205 --> 28:29.833
<i>the more I try to forget,</i>

28:31.251 --> 28:34.129
<i>the more it comes to mind.</i>

28:57.610 --> 28:59.070
<i>If my body is changed,</i>

29:00.029 --> 29:03.408
<i>then I want my heart to change with it.</i>

29:05.952 --> 29:08.121
I don't like this, Koshiro. Let's go back.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.289
Just a little more.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.540
You'll be fine. See? We're here.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.436
It's beautiful.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.146
Isn't it?

30:43.132 --> 30:44.843
UNKNOWN CALLER

30:48.096 --> 30:49.597
UNKNOWN CALLER

30:49.681 --> 30:50.974
"I'm going to kill myself."

31:13.371 --> 31:14.414
Hello?

31:16.624 --> 31:17.458
<i>You...</i>

31:20.670 --> 31:22.380
<i>changed bodies, didn't you?</i>
