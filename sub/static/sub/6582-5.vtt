QUEEN HELENA: I'd like you to
deliver this to Alistair Lacey.

00:12.405 --> 00:14.538
- I've decided I'd like to see him.
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:14.573 --> 00:16.740
I expect I can trust you
as I always have, Lucius.

00:16.776 --> 00:19.143
Of course. Implicitly.

00:19.879 --> 00:21.879
What are you doing here, Samantha?

00:21.914 --> 00:23.747
Just finishing what we started, baby.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.619
It's nothing personal, Captain Lacey.

00:29.955 --> 00:31.422
Please tell Henry the same.

00:31.457 --> 00:34.024
- And did you do as I asked?
- (Gunshots)

00:34.076 --> 00:37.194
The message was delivered and received.

00:37.229 --> 00:39.663
Despite our best efforts
to eradicate your cancer,

00:39.699 --> 00:41.198
it seems we're losing the war.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.599
We need to remove a testicle.

00:42.635 --> 00:46.103
Your Majesty, let me help you.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.342
It looks to me like
everything's working just fine.

00:51.344 --> 00:53.277
And you must be our
Deputy Prime Minister.

00:53.312 --> 00:54.678
Don't get too comfortable.

00:54.714 --> 00:56.580
These are shark-infested waters

00:56.615 --> 00:58.916
and those fake tits won't
keep you afloat for long.

01:00.586 --> 01:04.288
- It was you, wasn't it? (JEFFREY) I
didn't kill the King of England, Ted...

01:05.758 --> 01:08.459

02:52.882 --> 02:55.232
Congratulations. You're rehired.

02:55.284 --> 02:58.735
From now on, you'll be known
as Lady of the Privy Chamber.

02:59.472 --> 03:03.073
I want you to be devoted to
my well-being full-time.

03:03.442 --> 03:05.576
And since you'll no longer
be wearing a uniform,

03:05.611 --> 03:07.961
I thought a new wardrobe was in order.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.816
You really didn't need
to do any of this.

03:12.852 --> 03:14.835
I just like taking care of you.

03:15.504 --> 03:17.454

03:25.698 --> 03:28.916
Your Majesty, I am very sorry,

03:28.968 --> 03:31.702
but I was unable to deliver it.

03:32.204 --> 03:34.204
Captain Lacey's house was deserted.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.624
His car is gone and his neighbors said

03:37.676 --> 03:39.576
there's been no sign of him for months.

03:39.612 --> 03:41.245
And his mobile?

03:42.014 --> 03:43.680
Disconnected. I am sorry.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.851
You did tell him not to contact you

03:47.887 --> 03:50.020
following the paternity scandal.

03:50.055 --> 03:52.856
Perhaps he's just doing
as he was instructed.

03:53.475 --> 03:55.125
Perhaps?

03:56.662 --> 03:59.263
When I went to see Captain Lacey,

03:59.298 --> 04:01.031
after your television interview,

04:01.066 --> 04:03.500
he was angry with you, Ma'am.

04:03.536 --> 04:06.019
For using Henry's identity
to conceal the truth.

04:08.090 --> 04:09.740
Why didn't you tell me that before?

04:09.775 --> 04:11.475
The King had just been stabbed.

04:11.510 --> 04:14.177
You were in the midst
of a paternity scandal.

04:14.647 --> 04:16.747
I really didn't want to burden you.

Ex-boyfriend. Jealous

05:19.945 --> 05:23.046
Careful, Blondie, I could get jealous.

05:24.350 --> 05:26.617
Nah. Now it's my agent. He's
got a gig for me in Milan,

06:26.345 --> 06:29.246
I'm sorry, but I've got nothing on
that symbol from your necklace.

06:29.281 --> 06:32.482
MI5, MI6, Scotland Yard,
no-one knows anything.

06:32.518 --> 06:35.118
You don't remember anything
else from that night?

06:37.740 --> 06:40.357
What about Ted? Did the
symbol mean anything to him?

06:40.392 --> 06:42.426
He said he'd never seen it before.

06:52.604 --> 06:54.571
(Buzzer)

07:01.180 --> 07:03.180
Good morning, Your Majesty.

07:03.182 --> 07:04.881
You look dreadful.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.833
I've just got back from the memorial.

07:06.869 --> 07:10.470
I was sorry to see King Simon's
tribute so senselessly destroyed.

07:10.506 --> 07:13.824
For once, you and I agree.
What do we know?

07:15.561 --> 07:18.895
when he returned to the
palace last nightrentlk

07:18.947 --> 07:20.831
and his vehicle was damaged.

07:20.866 --> 07:24.518
We didn't know why, until Scotland
Yard called about the memorial.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.636
The King is out of control.

07:26.672 --> 07:28.839
For once, you and I agree.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.375
I suppose we have you
and your team to thank

07:32.411 --> 07:33.960
for keeping it out of the papers?

07:33.996 --> 07:36.313
Scotland Yard got the usual
call to make it go away,

07:36.365 --> 07:38.665
- but this time it wasn't us.
- If not us, then whom?

07:38.717 --> 07:39.720
We're looking into it.

07:39.745 --> 07:42.319
Like you're still looking
into my husband's murder?

07:42.354 --> 07:44.354
I carry that with me every day.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.796
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

07:53.699 --> 07:56.967
Well, perhaps you can
regain my confidence.

07:57.786 --> 08:00.087
I need your help finding someone.

08:01.457 --> 08:03.306
Who?

08:03.342 --> 08:05.509
Captain Alistair Lacey.

08:06.779 --> 08:10.347
- Do you know who he is?
- I know he's a very old friend of yours.

08:12.484 --> 08:13.984
How did you know that?

08:16.121 --> 08:18.004
I knew because the King knew.

08:18.056 --> 08:21.558
But your private affairs
are none of my business.

08:23.762 --> 08:27.547
I asked Lucius to deliver
a letter to him,

08:27.583 --> 08:30.650
but he claims Captain
Lacey has disappeared.

08:31.703 --> 08:33.135
I think he's lying.

08:33.172 --> 08:35.605
Lucius has been your
trusted ally for 25 years.

08:35.607 --> 08:39.442
Exactly. And I can tell
when he's hiding something.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.429
I want you to find out what.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.251
Hair of the dog?

08:49.421 --> 08:52.272
You asked for this meeting.
What is it you want?

08:52.307 --> 08:56.927
A gift. A one-time courtesy to
celebrate our new relationship.

08:56.962 --> 09:00.197
A headline on immigration reform?

09:00.232 --> 09:02.032
Color me unimpressed.

09:03.385 --> 09:07.070
It's not what the headline says
so much as what it doesn't.

09:07.105 --> 09:11.641
"King Destroys Memorial In
Drunken Rage," for instance.

09:11.677 --> 09:15.111
When my people told me, I
called in a few favors.

09:15.147 --> 09:17.080
Helped mitigate the fallout.

09:17.115 --> 09:19.816
Witnesses were paid
off and as we speak,

09:19.852 --> 09:23.753
there is a rumor circulating that will
ultimately blame the anti-monarchists.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.959
I think the words you're
looking for are, "Thank you."

09:29.761 --> 09:32.162
Is that it? Is that your gift?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.130
Well, I hope you've kept the receipt

09:34.132 --> 09:36.650
because I don't need your
help mitigating shit.

09:36.702 --> 09:41.605
Furthermore, you don't do me favors.
I do you favors.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.040
You're only in line
to be Prime Minister

09:44.092 --> 09:48.278
because you happened to be
standing next to the guy who died.

09:48.881 --> 09:51.514
I could say the same
about you, my King.

09:52.150 --> 09:55.218
If you don't sign the act
confirming me as Prime Minister,

09:55.254 --> 09:57.954
you're looking at a
constitutional crisis.

09:59.091 --> 10:01.358
And as for not caring
what the people think...

10:02.327 --> 10:05.178
..you might want to check page five.

10:19.778 --> 10:22.479
You know what they say
about guys with big chins.

10:23.215 --> 10:25.081
No balls.

10:25.117 --> 10:28.885
- What do you want from me?
- (Door opens)

10:28.921 --> 10:30.937
Your Majesty...

10:32.190 --> 10:34.124
- What is it?
- It's the Queen, Sir.

10:34.159 --> 10:36.293
She's been asking about Alistair.

10:37.246 --> 10:38.728
She wants me to find him.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.697
And?

10:40.699 --> 10:42.699
- I've taken care of it.
- Good.

10:42.751 --> 10:46.169
Because only one of us in this
room has sovereign immunity.

11:00.319 --> 11:02.235
- Psst!
- You're late.

11:02.271 --> 11:04.154
You sure we're good to talk down here?

11:04.189 --> 11:06.676
I've looped the cameras in this zone.
Where were you?

11:06.701 --> 11:08.058
I couldn't find the door.

11:08.093 --> 11:11.828
Six steps took me past it. I think you're
forgetting how long my legs are, baby.

11:11.863 --> 11:14.631
What are you doing, Samantha?
This wasn't part of the plan.

11:14.683 --> 11:16.266
You don't leave me much choice.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.519
First, radio silence and now I show up
to find out you've made zero progress?

11:19.571 --> 11:22.155
You owe me the explanation,
not the other way round.

11:22.190 --> 11:25.542
Lots of shit happened that
I had no control over.

11:25.577 --> 11:28.979
I went silent after the King was attacked.
Everyone was a suspect.

11:29.014 --> 11:31.765
Including me. I've only just
begun to earn their trust back.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.833
Exactly why you shouldn't have come.

11:33.869 --> 11:36.336
Some of our best work's
been done on the fly, baby.

11:36.371 --> 11:38.338
Not this time.

11:38.390 --> 11:42.359
Make whatever excuse you have to make
and say goodbye to the Princess.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.960
This is my plan. My con.

11:45.197 --> 11:48.298
I'm the one in control here, not you.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.389
(Door closes)

12:00.862 --> 12:06.149
Let me guess. He offered you a pile
of money and you have to go to Milan.

12:06.151 --> 12:08.284
He did offer me a pile of money...

12:08.320 --> 12:09.953
That's good.

12:13.158 --> 12:14.657
..but I turned him down.

12:15.877 --> 12:19.412
Screw Milan. I would so much
rather be here with you.

12:31.905 --> 12:34.463
Uh! Thank you.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.870
To a perfectly lazy brunch.

12:39.907 --> 12:42.507
If by lazy you mean the
motorcade we took to get here,

12:42.509 --> 12:45.343
the security sweep before we
stepped foot in the restaurant

12:45.379 --> 12:48.046
and the paparazzi circling
like vultures outside...

12:48.048 --> 12:50.599
- Then, sure, lazy brunch it is.
- Lazy.

12:50.651 --> 12:52.501
Yeah. (Giggles)

12:52.536 --> 12:54.302
Mm.

12:54.354 --> 12:57.556
So, your silver fox... What's his deal?

12:57.591 --> 12:59.558
He's making me guess his story.

12:59.593 --> 13:01.493
All I know is that he's a former cop

13:01.528 --> 13:03.462
who recently joined Royal Protection.

13:03.497 --> 13:06.531
- Any thoughts?
- My guess...

13:06.567 --> 13:09.501
He went undercover with the mob,
deep cover, like, seven years.

13:09.536 --> 13:14.039
Lines became blurred. Eventually, he had
to decide whose side he was really on.

13:14.074 --> 13:16.575
- Donnie Brasco. And no.
- (Mandy giggles)

13:17.995 --> 13:22.681
Never fear. I'll suss you out
eventually, Mr. Fox. I will.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.051
So what happened to the last bodyguard?

13:26.086 --> 13:27.853
Did you banish him from the kingdom?

13:27.888 --> 13:29.654
I wish.

13:29.690 --> 13:31.490
A long story.

13:32.292 --> 13:34.059
I've still got half a glass. Bring it.

13:37.464 --> 13:40.665
We kind of had a thing. It was messed up.
He was messed up.

13:40.701 --> 13:44.302
And, then, like all great
romances, he slept with my mum.

13:45.739 --> 13:49.207
- Wow!
- Yeah. Not cool.

13:50.577 --> 13:52.377
But you were really into him?

13:54.681 --> 13:57.249
Yeah, you know, I love
slumming it with the help.

13:57.284 --> 13:59.050
- (Laughs)
- Okay.

13:59.102 --> 14:00.652
He was a good shag. That was it.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.889
Okay. Whatever you say.

14:04.775 --> 14:07.292
Hey, it was nothing.

14:08.162 --> 14:09.978
He was nothing.

14:10.030 --> 14:12.547
He's certainly no you.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.066
(Camera shutter clicks)

14:18.605 --> 14:23.275
Thanks to your little stunt, the entire
country is now debating your lesbianism.

14:23.310 --> 14:25.777
More like mastur-debating.

14:28.081 --> 14:29.981
I didn't know anyone was watching.

14:30.017 --> 14:34.019
Oh, please, Eleanor. You know damn
well someone is always watching.

14:34.054 --> 14:38.823
Thanks to this photo, you're now the
poster child for the LGBTQ movement.

14:39.726 --> 14:41.760
What the hell does the
Q stand for, anyway?

14:41.795 --> 14:43.395
Questioning, darling.

14:43.430 --> 14:46.364
Well, let's be frank, we've
all spent time in Q.

14:48.402 --> 14:53.438
Darling, don't tell me you haven't tasted
the rainbow once or twice in your life.

14:54.541 --> 14:57.542
- Mm? Oh, please.
- (Giggles)

14:58.495 --> 15:00.462
What do you have to say for yourself?

15:00.514 --> 15:03.982
I wasn't trying to make
some big statement, Mother.

15:04.017 --> 15:06.418
I've finally found someone
that I really like.

15:06.453 --> 15:08.820
"Choose love," remember?
Those were your words.

15:08.855 --> 15:11.756
- I was high.
- Ha! Mother Of The Year.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.742
Pot, kettle...

15:13.794 --> 15:15.560
And don't you dare
turn this back on me.

15:16.647 --> 15:20.198
Being a Royal comes with the
responsibility of the public spotlight.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.134
We can't just go about
doing anything we please.

15:23.170 --> 15:24.769
Someone should tell that to Cyrus.

15:24.805 --> 15:27.505
Oh? What has our dear uncle done now?

15:27.541 --> 15:30.041
Destroyed Dad's memorial. While drunk.

15:30.077 --> 15:33.578
I certainly don't condone
Cyrus's actions.

15:33.614 --> 15:35.880
Well, he's always been
jealous of Simon.

15:35.882 --> 15:39.150
I suppose the memorial antagonized him.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.770
Oh, of course. It's my fault.

15:41.805 --> 15:44.573
Well, if the kettle fits...

15:48.161 --> 15:50.278
I'm helping the Queen
on a personal matter

15:50.330 --> 15:53.498
and, as such, I won't be attending
this afternoon's Investiture.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.934
I am, therefore, relying on
you two to take the lead.

15:55.969 --> 15:59.754
All security clearances and backgrounds
should be checked and double-checked.

15:59.806 --> 16:02.657
- Yes, sir.
- Things have progressed rather quickly

16:02.709 --> 16:04.476
with Princess Eleanor's new friend.

16:04.511 --> 16:06.578
I think it's time we vet
her more thoroughly.

16:06.613 --> 16:10.048
Actually, I took the liberty of running
the usual drill with Royal Protection.

16:10.083 --> 16:12.717
- She checked out.
- The Princess is my detail.

16:12.753 --> 16:15.587
Old habits. I appreciate
the initiative, Mr. Frost,

16:15.639 --> 16:18.757
but from now on, Mr. Hill handles all
matters relating to the Princess.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.426
- Make sure he gets a copy of the report.
- Understood.

16:30.937 --> 16:33.438
My timing is impeccable.

16:33.473 --> 16:37.442
Oh, blast. I was hoping to surprise
you with my finished look. Zip me.

16:48.372 --> 16:50.388
All of the gifts, the promotion...

16:50.390 --> 16:52.657
It's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

16:52.659 --> 16:54.626
You're wonderful. Truly.

16:54.678 --> 16:56.645
Tell that to page five.

16:58.065 --> 17:00.365
(Laughs) It's just a silly cartoon.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.600
I'm sure they do this sort
of thing all the time.

17:02.636 --> 17:05.002
Why should this one bother
you any more than any other?

17:05.038 --> 17:07.989
Now shoo! I want to surprise
you with my next look.

17:15.882 --> 17:18.116
Clearly you have a thing for maids.

17:18.117 --> 17:20.018
Oh, shut up.

17:20.053 --> 17:22.119
She makes a good point.

17:23.957 --> 17:26.391
Why should this one bother
you more than any other?

17:26.425 --> 17:30.028
Do you have any idea what it was
like growing up in your shadow?

17:30.063 --> 17:34.499
Being reminded at every turn that you're
nothing more than genetic back-up?

17:34.501 --> 17:36.134
Not my fault.

17:37.270 --> 17:39.020
You're wrong.

17:39.072 --> 17:41.072
Dead wrong. Pun intended.

17:41.975 --> 17:43.775
You were my big brother.

17:43.810 --> 17:46.911
You could've looked out for me.
Stepped aside from time to time.

17:46.913 --> 17:48.880
Let me see some of the sun.

17:49.716 --> 17:52.984
You could've helped me,
but you never did.

17:57.891 --> 17:59.958
You couldn't be helped.

18:02.212 --> 18:04.946
Instead of commanding respect...

18:06.133 --> 18:10.301
..you manipulate, you
lie, you threaten.

18:11.238 --> 18:14.506
You could never step out of my shadow
because you don't deserve the sun.

18:15.509 --> 18:21.112
You're not a King... and you
never will be, brother.

18:28.955 --> 18:30.955
Lucius?

18:32.125 --> 18:33.591
Lucius!

18:36.313 --> 18:38.396
That cartoonist.

18:38.448 --> 18:42.734
The one who poked fun at me in today's
paper. Invite him to the ceremony.

18:42.736 --> 18:46.738
I think it's time the press
got to know "the real me".

18:46.740 --> 18:48.740
How very gracious of you, Sir.

18:48.792 --> 18:51.159
I will get in touch
with him straight away.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.915
(Whispers) You want to see a King?

18:56.967 --> 18:58.917
I'll show you one, brother.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.553
I'll show you all.

19:23.198 --> 19:25.332
Really? You drove here?

19:25.384 --> 19:29.102
You try walking across the palace
grounds once you've lost a plum.

19:30.739 --> 19:33.106
Now, that's a greeting.

19:33.142 --> 19:36.610
- Is that our doe-eyed maid?
- Not maid.

19:36.645 --> 19:38.578
Lady of the Privy Chamber.

19:40.416 --> 19:42.816
What is it with this
family and the help?

19:45.154 --> 19:48.355
My father was greatly inspired
by your work, Mr. Cabral.

19:48.390 --> 19:51.591
Your father was one of the good ones.
Truly.

19:51.627 --> 19:54.861
Mr. Cabral, may I introduce
Ambassador Jean?

19:54.897 --> 19:57.047
- Excuse me, Your Highness.
- Pleasure.

19:57.099 --> 19:59.299
Alright, I'll see you later.

20:06.675 --> 20:09.026
So, are you here for the
dessert or the booze?

20:09.051 --> 20:09.834
Both.

20:10.612 --> 20:14.147
My family's trust funds
Oscar's charity.

20:14.183 --> 20:16.116
When he sought political asylum here,

20:16.151 --> 20:18.318
my grandfather sponsored
him for citizenship.

20:18.353 --> 20:20.754
He's incredibly inspiring, isn't he?

20:22.057 --> 20:26.893
He is. And inspiration seems to
be a rare commodity these days.

20:32.167 --> 20:35.735
Your Majesty, may I present Mr.
Levi Drew?

20:35.771 --> 20:38.138
The editorial cartoonist
of the Independent Times.

20:38.173 --> 20:40.373
Mr. Drew, so kind of you to join us.

20:40.409 --> 20:43.035
I must say, I was a bit
surprised to get the invite.

20:43.060 --> 20:43.910
Nonsense.

20:43.946 --> 20:45.962
I thought your cartoon
was rather funny.

20:46.014 --> 20:49.049
So important not to take
oneself too seriously.

20:49.084 --> 20:52.285
Plus, I've always said my
chin is my best feature.

20:53.088 --> 20:54.988
(Laughs nervously)

20:55.023 --> 20:57.357
How's our Deputy Prime Minister?

20:57.392 --> 21:00.327
- Still clawing your way to the middle?
- Congratulations.

21:00.329 --> 21:03.497
There seems to be a sudden change in
support for your Succession Bill.

21:03.532 --> 21:05.031
Strange, that.

21:05.067 --> 21:08.051
Maybe our Members of Parliament know
a good idea when they hear one.

21:08.103 --> 21:11.838
Maybe. Or maybe you've been
currying favor with the MPs.

21:11.874 --> 21:16.376
Which would be a vast overstep of your
very limited powers as Dowager Queen.

21:16.411 --> 21:18.145
Queen Consort.

21:18.197 --> 21:20.213
Perhaps a lesson in
royal lineage for you.

21:20.249 --> 21:22.282
Let me be clear.

21:22.317 --> 21:25.585
The monarchy has no place
meddling in Parliament.

21:26.088 --> 21:29.256
So, whatever it is that
you're doing, stop!

22:01.957 --> 22:05.492
Today, we honor the
incomparable Oscar Cabral.

22:05.527 --> 22:07.460
A man who inspired a nation.

22:07.496 --> 22:10.030
Not only with his voice,

22:10.082 --> 22:12.599
but through the subversive
power of his art.

22:12.634 --> 22:17.370
A political activist who helped
bring peace to a war-torn nation.

22:17.406 --> 22:21.841
An artist who suffered the horrors
of being a political prisoner,

22:21.877 --> 22:24.427
then painted his way to freedom.

22:25.180 --> 22:28.315
It's all so... nice.

22:28.350 --> 22:30.517
That's one approach.

22:30.552 --> 22:33.720
My approach is somewhat different.

22:33.755 --> 22:35.722
Unlike my predecessors

22:35.757 --> 22:37.891
and unlike the leaders of this country,

22:37.926 --> 22:40.894
I'm done pandering to
the ignorant herd.

22:40.929 --> 22:43.196
This country used to be great,

22:43.232 --> 22:45.332
but that was when the
monarchy was great.

22:45.367 --> 22:49.936
It's time someone put the
balls back on this throne.

22:49.938 --> 22:52.439
Back on this country.

22:55.327 --> 22:57.027
Stand up, please, sir.

22:57.079 --> 22:59.162
You can't arrest me for
drawing a cartoon.

22:59.197 --> 23:00.780
I have a right to my opinion.

23:00.782 --> 23:04.284
If you want free speech, go to America.

23:07.456 --> 23:09.623
Great work, Cabral.

23:15.130 --> 23:17.464
(Whispers) Careful what you paint.

23:39.179 --> 23:42.697
- You certainly showed them.
- I certainly did.

23:42.732 --> 23:47.102
The thing is, you can make
all the speeches you want

23:47.137 --> 23:49.571
and destroy every last effigy.

23:50.373 --> 23:54.109
It doesn't alter the fact that you will
never be able to step out of my shadow.

23:54.161 --> 23:55.960
Not truly.

23:57.647 --> 24:00.482
Eventually, the people will forget you.

24:00.517 --> 24:03.368
They always forget the nice kings.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.220
Nice is boring.

24:05.856 --> 24:10.058
But the people will
remember my name forever.

24:11.428 --> 24:15.196
They don't have to like me,
but they will fear me.

24:19.903 --> 24:22.770
So go back to wherever you came from.

Well, they've always chalked you up to
be nothing more than the Playboy Prince.

24:40.307 --> 24:44.459
The fun one. But I was watching
you during your uncle's speech.

24:44.494 --> 24:48.029
You care. You were just as disgusted
with Cyrus's behavior as anyone.

24:48.064 --> 24:49.464
Okay.

24:49.466 --> 24:53.568
What I'm trying to say is we may
have more in common than I realized.

24:53.603 --> 24:55.270
Maybe we can help each another.

24:56.907 --> 24:59.340
I saw you going toe-to-toe
with my mother earlier.

24:59.376 --> 25:02.043
While I respect anybody that's
willing to go up against her,

25:02.078 --> 25:04.145
I'm done being a pawn in
other people's games.

25:04.197 --> 25:06.047
It hasn't really been
working out for me.

25:06.082 --> 25:08.917
No games. I just want to talk.

Oh, shit.

Thank you?

25:24.034 --> 25:26.618
You clearly didn't want to
be in that conversation.

25:26.653 --> 25:29.671
It was the best I could come
up with on short notice.

25:29.706 --> 25:32.156
You're right. You want
to get out of here?

25:32.192 --> 25:35.059
Absolutely. Where to?

25:35.095 --> 25:37.078
I know a place.

25:42.052 --> 25:44.986
At first glance, it seems your
primary interests are baked goods,

25:45.038 --> 25:48.673
binge drinking, philanthropy and polo.

25:48.725 --> 25:49.809
(Giggles)

25:49.834 --> 25:53.061
Seriously though, how is
it you came to play polo?

25:53.096 --> 25:55.296
Female players aren't
exactly a dime a dozen.

25:55.332 --> 25:57.315
Especially not ones as good as you.

25:57.350 --> 25:58.900
My father is a polo player.

25:58.935 --> 26:01.920
Or at least he was one
until he met my mother.

26:01.955 --> 26:05.974
At the time, she was engaged
to some Lord or another.

26:06.009 --> 26:07.809
An appropriate choice.

26:07.844 --> 26:10.144
So, when she broke off the engagement,

26:10.180 --> 26:13.448
because she fell in love with a
low-born Argentine ten-goaler,

26:13.483 --> 26:15.016
it was quite the scandal.

26:15.835 --> 26:18.953
My grandfather, a Viscount, furious.

26:18.989 --> 26:21.172
He all but disowned my mother.

26:21.207 --> 26:23.891
I grew up on a farm in Argentina

26:23.927 --> 26:26.261
where my father trained
and sold polo horses.

26:26.296 --> 26:28.296
So what happened?

26:28.331 --> 26:33.101
My grandfather's health began to
fade and he had a change of heart.

26:33.136 --> 26:36.020
Decided he wanted to know
his only grandchild.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.839
Your mother chose love.

26:38.642 --> 26:41.209
She gave it all up for
the one she wanted.

26:41.261 --> 26:43.211
She did.

26:43.246 --> 26:45.880
It wasn't always easy but, in
the end, it all worked out.

26:50.787 --> 26:52.287
My mother did the opposite.

26:53.523 --> 26:55.323
She chose wealth and power.

26:56.259 --> 26:59.260
I'm afraid the consequences of
that choice are still playing out.

27:07.270 --> 27:10.104
I found this on a table
at Captain Lacey's house.

27:10.140 --> 27:12.840
It's a burn mark from a shell casing.

27:13.543 --> 27:16.477
The type you get when a firearm
has been discharged nearby.

27:18.648 --> 27:20.748
A gun was fired in Alistair's cottage?

27:20.784 --> 27:24.585
Yes. And yet there was no
obvious sign of a struggle.

27:27.023 --> 27:29.057
Something happened at
Alistair's cottage

27:29.092 --> 27:32.293

deal of trouble to cover it up.

27:43.940 --> 27:45.907
Join me for a glass of whiskey?

27:45.959 --> 27:47.825
I would be honored, Ma'am.

27:55.752 --> 27:57.719
Thank you.

27:58.722 --> 28:01.723
The strangest thing happened
at the ceremony today.

28:03.693 --> 28:05.893
I saw Alistair in the crowd.

28:05.929 --> 28:08.913
- That's not possible.
- Why?

28:10.383 --> 28:12.467
I looked everywhere for Captain Lacey.

28:12.502 --> 28:15.970
If he made it onto the palace
grounds, I would know.

28:16.005 --> 28:20.858
But that's not why you're so certain I
couldn't have seen him today, is it?

28:23.713 --> 28:26.948
How many times have you lied
for me over the years, Lucius?

28:26.983 --> 28:29.917
A hundred? A thousand?

28:30.720 --> 28:33.621
Do you really think I don't
know what it looks like?

28:34.591 --> 28:36.858
Now tell me the truth.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.559
I can't.

28:38.595 --> 28:40.361
You can.

28:41.498 --> 28:45.633
What was done... was done to protect
the monarchy. To protect you.

28:46.569 --> 28:49.737
What was done, Lucius? What did you do?

28:50.590 --> 28:52.473
- He's gone, Your Majesty.
- Gone?

28:52.509 --> 28:55.376
Gone where? Gone why?

28:55.378 --> 28:58.146
You tell me what you did, goddammit!

29:02.519 --> 29:04.018
He's dead.

29:04.988 --> 29:06.587
It had to be done.

29:10.577 --> 29:12.727
Once you lied about Henry,

29:12.762 --> 29:16.464
about Alistair's identity,
he was a loose-end.

29:16.499 --> 29:18.533
A liability.

29:19.536 --> 29:24.639
I couldn't stand by and watch him
ruin everything you've sacrificed.

29:24.674 --> 29:26.774
Everything that we have worked for.

29:27.911 --> 29:30.077
You must understand, Helena.

29:39.923 --> 29:42.089
Take him away.

29:55.622 --> 29:59.707
Everything I've done, I've
done out of love for you.

30:01.377 --> 30:04.512
Alistair's not the only
one I'll never see again.

30:05.298 --> 30:08.132
Now, walk... away.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.572
So this is your drinking spot.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.006
I like it.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.043
I uso come here when I was a kid.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.178
Usually, when I didn't
want to be found.

30:49.214 --> 30:51.347
Not to drink.

30:54.018 --> 30:57.186
I'm sorry again about today.
My uncle was way out of line.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.821
My father was right.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.491
We're a bunch of zoo animals.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.259
We don't deserve the monarchy.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.996
Sometimes I wish I could
just walk away from it all.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.799
Get out.

31:09.834 --> 31:12.101
Let them have it.

31:12.136 --> 31:14.570
You're a tragic figure, Liam.
You know that?

31:16.307 --> 31:17.740
I get wanting to walk away.

31:17.792 --> 31:20.576
But you're as in as
anyone ever has been

31:20.612 --> 31:22.328

33:13.157 --> 33:14.924
Hm.

33:15.927 --> 33:19.562

Everything that mattered to me,

33:24.969 --> 33:27.303
everything that was important...

you can do for your Queen.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.281
Anything.

34:45.333 --> 34:49.768
Our nation suffered a great
blow when Simon died.

34:49.821 --> 34:54.739
And, with no killer brought to
justice, the wound refuses to heal.

34:54.792 --> 34:56.992
Our country needs closure.

..she needs this.

(Sighs) Is there no other way?

35:17.665 --> 35:19.698
You're already a murderer, Lucius.

35:20.284 --> 35:24.787
Think of it as one final
act of grace for her.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.629
I stabbed him.

35:34.632 --> 35:38.434
Once in the stomach and
once in the chest.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.687
(OFFICER) I'm gonna need
you to repeat that.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.191
I killed the King of England.

36:03.179 --> 36:06.530
So it was Lucius, then.
Ted Pryce confirmed.

36:06.825 --> 36:08.608
That he killed Simon?

36:08.643 --> 36:10.276
He didn't.

36:10.312 --> 36:12.478
Then why confess?

36:12.514 --> 36:16.783
Out of some deranged sense
of loyalty, I suppose.

36:16.818 --> 36:20.820
And as broken as that is,
we're going to let him.

36:20.856 --> 36:23.790
Because he may not have killed Simon...

36:25.160 --> 36:26.659
..but he did kill Alistair.

36:26.695 --> 36:28.478
My god.

36:29.648 --> 36:31.097
How? Why?

36:31.132 --> 36:32.765

36:33.835 --> 36:35.468

36:36.972 --> 36:40.707

children in the eyes

36:40.742 --> 36:44.244

murder has been solved.

- Hear what?
- Your father's killer has been found.

37:08.103 --> 37:10.270
It was Lucius.

37:11.306 --> 37:14.991
He was furious with Simon for
wanting to abolish the monarchy.

37:15.043 --> 37:17.610
He's confessed. He's in custody.

37:19.447 --> 37:21.614
I know this comes as a great shock...

37:22.567 --> 37:27.537
..but perhaps now we can all begin to
put this dark episode behind us...

37:28.323 --> 37:30.089
..and begin to heal.

37:30.091 --> 37:33.192

Yes.
