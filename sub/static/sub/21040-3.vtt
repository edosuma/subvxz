00:00.450 --> 00:03.375
Lorraine Mackeson,
the woman whose phone you used,

00:03.401 --> 00:06.137
saw you stand up and put something
into your jacket.

00:06.163 --> 00:07.702
It must have been my phone.

00:08.690 --> 00:12.087
- He's lying about something.
- Got a bit defensive, didn't he?

00:12.263 --> 00:15.263
Why didn't you say that Niall Swift
taught your daughter?

00:15.289 --> 00:17.971
- Are you on the investigation team?
- No, I'm not.

00:17.997 --> 00:21.309
Our man on licence, Leighton
Thomas, who knows about him?

00:21.335 --> 00:25.175
His crimes appal me, but I admire
the way he's turned his life around.

00:25.201 --> 00:27.589
I committed murder.
Is that what you want to hear?

00:27.845 --> 00:30.318
It is a sliver of brain
from Niall Swift.

00:30.890 --> 00:33.790
You are surprised the blood
didn't match the brain?

00:34.430 --> 00:36.416
We might be looking at another victim.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.524
We could have the killer's handwriting.

00:38.887 --> 00:40.233
His first mistake.

00:40.259 --> 00:42.699
We've a missing teenager,
Jonjo Patterson.

00:42.725 --> 00:46.805
Our communications officer is organising
an immediate appeal for tomorrow.

00:46.831 --> 00:49.033
- Jonjo...
- One simple message.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.826
Help us find this boy.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:47.870 --> 01:49.925
John Joseph Patterson, known as Jonjo,

01:49.950 --> 01:52.665
is a vulnerable 18-year-old student.

01:53.126 --> 01:55.365
He was last seen at the family home

01:55.390 --> 01:57.036
around 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning.

01:59.663 --> 02:02.613
My message to Jonjo would be,

02:03.470 --> 02:05.790
there's nothing for you to worry about.

02:07.321 --> 02:11.788
You're our son,
and we love you very much.

02:13.870 --> 02:15.493
And we just want you back.

02:15.519 --> 02:17.083
That's all we want, Jonjo.

02:19.972 --> 02:21.873
Jonjo didn't go home last night.

02:22.150 --> 02:23.125
Shit.

02:23.150 --> 02:24.565
Have you told your mum what happened?

02:25.370 --> 02:27.250
- Not really.
- Not really?

02:27.955 --> 02:30.096
- I didn't tell her.
- But why?

02:30.547 --> 02:32.365
Which lab did the newspaper go to?

02:33.275 --> 02:34.576
Inverness.

02:35.070 --> 02:37.125
Are you concerned his disappearance

02:37.150 --> 02:38.960
is connected to the murder
of Niall Swift?

02:38.986 --> 02:42.727
No. Sadly, Jonjo has bipolar disorder.

02:42.753 --> 02:44.706
We believe he's neglected
his medication.

02:44.770 --> 02:47.365
Rumors are rife
a human heart has been found.

02:47.390 --> 02:49.205
I'm here to appeal for the safe return

02:49.230 --> 02:50.205
of Jonjo Patterson.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.205
I'm not responding to rumors.

02:51.230 --> 02:52.918
But don't you think
the people who live here...

02:52.944 --> 02:54.833
Uh, I'm Blake Albrighton.

02:55.159 --> 02:56.485
I've been seconded to the investigation

02:56.510 --> 02:57.885
as forensic psychologist.

02:57.910 --> 03:00.817
And, yes, you're right.
Rumors have to be addressed.

03:01.036 --> 03:03.205
There is, I believe,
at large in this community

03:03.230 --> 03:05.205
an extremely smart and highly
dangerous serial killer.

03:05.230 --> 03:07.525
No, Blake, you need to withdraw that.

03:10.510 --> 03:13.865
I'm urging you to give
this appeal maximum publicity.

03:14.230 --> 03:16.168
The safe return of Jonjo depends on it.

03:16.194 --> 03:19.005
D.C.I. Smilie, how long
have you known about this?

03:19.030 --> 03:21.045
I have no comment to
make on any of this.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.965
I'm here solely to appeal
for the safe return

03:22.990 --> 03:24.134
of Jonjo Patterson.

03:24.390 --> 03:26.190
If I could have
everybody's attention, please.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.851
If I could have
everybody's attention, please!

03:29.350 --> 03:30.510
Annie?

03:31.390 --> 03:33.605
- No, no, no, no, no.
- It's not been confirmed.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.765
It's not like that. It's not like that.

03:35.790 --> 03:37.565
I want him gone! Do you hear?

03:37.590 --> 03:38.765
I had no idea he was...

03:38.790 --> 03:40.465
Hijacked that for his own agenda.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.240
Supposed to be
restricted bloody parking!

03:47.881 --> 03:50.904
This is Loch bloody Ness
we're talking about!

03:51.118 --> 03:53.517
Thanks to Albrighton,
you're going to be operating

03:53.550 --> 03:55.645
- with the world's press up your ass,
- There's something I need to talk...

03:55.670 --> 03:57.405
wet-nursing a community in meltdown.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.205
You read his book?

03:58.230 --> 03:59.965
I don't need to read his book.
I work with him.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.904
Sees his sister's face in every victim.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.305
My advice, get rid.

04:03.331 --> 04:05.125
Bring in somebody
with two feet on the ground.

04:05.150 --> 04:08.274
- Before you go into... - P.C. Denny,
blue Mercedes van on Canal Road.

04:08.300 --> 04:11.115
Looks like it was parked by the
blind one from Peters and Lee.

04:11.165 --> 04:13.245
- Who?
- Doesn't matter who.

04:13.270 --> 04:15.016
Sort it out.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.565
I make one call, forget promotion.

04:19.589 --> 04:21.651
- You don't dump this on me.
- You brought him in here.

04:21.697 --> 04:23.901
- And I haven't even started on the...
- Before you...

04:24.916 --> 04:26.791
What in the name of fuck is this?

04:26.817 --> 04:29.600
It's a communications hub.
Superintendent's orders.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.010
Bloody bastard.

04:34.110 --> 04:35.430
You on a break?

04:40.590 --> 04:41.845
- What?
- Frank.

04:41.870 --> 04:43.205
He had one of his Krakatoas.

04:43.230 --> 04:44.638
There's blood and snot everywhere.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.045
Why do I always miss the fun?

04:46.070 --> 04:47.938
Probation Service been trying
to get in touch.

04:47.964 --> 04:49.019
Annie!

04:49.125 --> 04:51.222
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

04:51.505 --> 04:53.705
12 hours airborne, come home for a kip.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.275
Dafty here is getting ready for college.

04:56.418 --> 04:59.125
The parents I've spoken to
are keeping their kids home.

04:59.150 --> 05:00.365
Evie's going in.

05:00.390 --> 05:01.431
You see?

05:02.083 --> 05:05.510
There's one dead, one missing,
stuff we can't mention,

05:05.576 --> 05:07.071
and you're telling me it's safe?

05:07.097 --> 05:08.032
Mhari, it's your call.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.658
My opinion, if we're sensible,
we're safe.

05:12.485 --> 05:15.685
You end up at the bottom of a
cliff, don't come running to me.

05:17.030 --> 05:18.110
12-hour shift?

05:18.870 --> 05:20.527
I still can't feel my arse.

05:20.642 --> 05:23.282
Shame, 'cause no one else will.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.448
- When's Evie off?
- Hm.

05:29.350 --> 05:32.281
Today we are straddling two horses.

05:32.692 --> 05:34.673
Yep, for a change.

05:35.153 --> 05:37.365
Without neglecting the jobs
you were assigned,

05:37.390 --> 05:39.085
anyone you talk to today,

05:39.110 --> 05:41.839
ask if they have seen or had any contact

05:41.865 --> 05:45.320
with John Joseph Patterson
in the last 24 hours.

05:45.408 --> 05:48.596
A few of you have asked
if we've established a link

05:48.730 --> 05:51.545
between the Swift murder and the heart.

05:51.750 --> 05:55.111
Not yet. Forensics are working on it.

05:55.137 --> 05:58.310
Chief Inspector, is there
something I can help you with?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.604
Just seeing how it's done.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.611
D.S. Redford has some news.

06:05.608 --> 06:07.106
- The DNA?
- Yep.

06:10.793 --> 06:13.180
In the hope that it'll help us
identify the heart,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.725
the Crown Office have allowed
voluntary DNA testing

06:15.750 --> 06:18.205
of all adults in the Lochnafoy area.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.629
I know. Miracle.

06:21.849 --> 06:25.441
In the first pass, we'll target
males aged 24 to 44.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.672
Treat any refusal as suspicious.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.845
So, on top of everything else,

06:59.870 --> 07:01.425
you're a probation officer, as well?

07:01.753 --> 07:04.848
You'll have Nicole Patterson
back as soon as Jonjo shows up.

07:05.030 --> 07:07.086
Okay. Do you want a tea, coffee?

07:07.112 --> 07:08.127
Kettle's just boiled.

07:08.153 --> 07:10.514
Let's just keep it formal.

07:10.540 --> 07:11.851
Y-Yeah, sure.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.525
You know this has to be daily
until we catch...

07:14.550 --> 07:15.541
Of course.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.716
It's a bit early for that, isn't it?

07:19.594 --> 07:20.754
That was last night.

07:23.269 --> 07:24.429
Leighton...

07:27.110 --> 07:29.544
What's happening in this town
is bound to remind you of...

07:31.964 --> 07:35.422
If you need help,
we can pay for counseling.

07:35.725 --> 07:38.740
I spent 20 years
talking about what I did.

07:38.955 --> 07:40.805
And therapy helped you understand

07:40.830 --> 07:41.870
why you did those things.

07:42.489 --> 07:45.099
A wound doesn't heal
if you keep opening it up.

07:56.990 --> 07:58.805
I don't want to mention the car.

07:58.830 --> 08:00.405
Are you serious?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.267
Evie?

08:09.350 --> 08:11.660
_

08:12.920 --> 08:14.600
Why didn't you show me this last night?

08:15.069 --> 08:18.056
- Well, you were asleep.
- Since when did that bother you?

08:18.412 --> 08:21.090
Sometimes Jonjo does stuff
to get your attention.

08:21.882 --> 08:23.472
Uh, are you keeping that?

08:25.996 --> 08:27.238
For the time being.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.583
W-What is it?

08:36.840 --> 08:38.707
Last night we were almost killed.

08:39.177 --> 08:40.912
Some maniac drove us off the road.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.633
- Where?
- Road to Foyers Point,

08:42.659 --> 08:43.924
where we were supposed to meet Jonjo.

08:44.126 --> 08:45.458
Evie?

08:45.866 --> 08:48.833
She didn't want to tell you
because she took your car.

08:48.875 --> 08:49.890
Cheers.

08:49.916 --> 08:52.145
Point to where you
think it started following you.

08:52.550 --> 08:55.417
Uh... about here.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.685
There's a speed camera just
after the hydroelectric dam.

09:00.710 --> 09:02.759
Unless it came off a side road,
we should get an I.D.

09:02.785 --> 09:04.200
Can you describe the vehicle?

09:04.505 --> 09:05.903
Well, it didn't have its lights on.

09:05.929 --> 09:07.772
- At first.
- Then it had them on full beam.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.533
- Couldn't see a thing.
- Any witnesses?

09:09.559 --> 09:10.885
Bethan McGrellish's dad.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.125
He came over to see if we were okay.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.972
Could he have come from the car
that was chasing you?

09:14.069 --> 09:16.071
I don't know. Maybe.

09:16.630 --> 09:18.376
Are you going to arrest Dr. Marr?

09:18.790 --> 09:20.692
That's not a question we'd ever answer.

09:20.718 --> 09:22.205
What about Jonjo's message?

09:22.230 --> 09:23.710
We'll take appropriate steps.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.473
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

09:34.830 --> 09:36.482
How old is your daughter?

09:36.763 --> 09:37.809
18.

09:38.090 --> 09:40.466
You can't be responsible
for everything they do.

09:41.156 --> 09:43.805
When I was 18, I went
to see Prince at Maine Road.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.463
Me and Shona Worthington
snuck into his hotel

09:46.489 --> 09:47.944
and managed to get into his room.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.965
God. Did... Did anything...

09:50.990 --> 09:52.890
No, no. No, he was
an absolute gentleman.

09:53.221 --> 09:54.581
Unfortunately.

09:55.473 --> 09:57.928
Okay, um, here's what we need to do.

09:57.954 --> 10:00.489
Interview Dr. Marr.
He's due here in 10 minutes.

10:00.670 --> 10:02.765
Then pay Don McGrellish a visit.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.696
Bit convenient, him just being there.

10:04.722 --> 10:07.125
And drive up to Foyers Point
and see what you can see.

10:07.150 --> 10:08.731
No problem. On it.

10:10.790 --> 10:11.910
"On it"?

10:22.113 --> 10:23.993
Touch the icon to activate a trace.

10:26.757 --> 10:28.252
Shouldn't it beep or something?

10:28.278 --> 10:30.045
Either Jonjo's phone is out of range

10:30.070 --> 10:31.532
or the battery's been removed.

10:31.609 --> 10:33.209
When that changes, you'll get a signal.

10:33.659 --> 10:36.120
Right. I also need you
to track that phone.

10:36.443 --> 10:38.296
- Is it yours?
- It's my daughter's.

10:38.395 --> 10:39.678
That would be illegal.

10:40.928 --> 10:42.598
You don't have children, do you?

11:51.990 --> 11:53.310
No, it'll be fine.

12:18.980 --> 12:21.882
On the day he was killed,
Niall Swift was in your house.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.488
We went over this yesterday.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.140
Why did you fire him?

12:29.140 --> 12:32.544
For the record, I'm showing
Dr. Marr a broken compact disc.

12:33.890 --> 12:35.710
Would we find your fingerprints on this?

12:40.515 --> 12:44.195
Swift gave that to my daughter.

12:45.589 --> 12:48.303
I listened to the first song,
and it was obscene,

12:48.978 --> 12:52.627
so I fired him
to protect my little girl.

12:54.426 --> 12:56.355
A phone message
has come to our attention.

12:56.616 --> 12:58.235
The person who sent it
claims to know something

12:58.260 --> 12:59.599
that would send you to prison.

13:02.305 --> 13:03.745
Send me to prison?

13:06.020 --> 13:07.235
You're named in the message.

13:07.260 --> 13:08.235
Who by?

13:08.504 --> 13:10.058
I can't divulge that.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.933
Is it a patient?

13:15.340 --> 13:17.796
- This is slander.
- What are they referring to?

13:20.260 --> 13:22.280
I'm here voluntarily.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.980
Your manner is really hostile
and aggressive.

13:34.721 --> 13:36.324
I've had enough of this.

13:42.980 --> 13:46.103
<i>Your manner is hostile and aggressive.</i>

13:49.860 --> 13:51.115
<i>I've had enough of this.</i>

13:54.860 --> 13:56.887
Do you think Jonjo Patterson
knows something?

13:57.300 --> 13:58.675
He certainly thinks so.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.635
This will justify a search warrant.

14:00.971 --> 14:04.180
That's your boss on the phone.
Something about Albrighton.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.660
He's a fucking secretary
all of a sudden.

14:13.180 --> 14:14.595
Are you here about the newspaper?

14:14.620 --> 14:15.795
Yes.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.612
We're in the middle of processing it.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.608
Is it working?
You can enhance the letters?

14:20.889 --> 14:22.096
Are you police?

14:23.833 --> 14:26.208
Hm. I read one of your books.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.435
So you know how important it is
that I see the process.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.235
That way you get the credit you deserve.

14:31.260 --> 14:33.235
You are full of shit.

14:33.260 --> 14:34.355
I am full of shit.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.053
No one says it to my face, though.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.275
This is a restricted area.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.460
You can't come in.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.020
Okay.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.807
Tell me what you do, and I'll
write it like it was all me.

14:54.780 --> 14:57.035
<i>Hi. This is the
voicemail for Blake Albrighton.</i>

14:57.060 --> 14:58.955
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

14:58.980 --> 15:00.195
Well done, Blake.

15:00.220 --> 15:02.515
Light the blue touch paper
and run like fuck.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.675
My boss has just been on the phone.
He wants you gone.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.795
But he's left it up to me
so he's got deniability.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.874
Call me as soon as you get this.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.635
You said you might have found something

15:17.660 --> 15:19.555
to link the heart to the Swift murder.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.515
Might have.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.515
A number of tests are being rerun.

15:22.724 --> 15:24.155
The blood in the bag
didn't match the brain.

15:24.180 --> 15:25.249
What does it match?

15:25.275 --> 15:26.520
What I'm hearing,

15:26.700 --> 15:28.675
your psychologist bod is being a dick,

15:28.700 --> 15:31.475
Frank is waving the claymore,
and you are piggy in the middle.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.774
My psychologist is
an oceangoing dick on stilts.

15:35.094 --> 15:36.429
But the investigation needs him.

15:36.455 --> 15:37.728
<i>You</i> need him.

15:53.580 --> 15:54.900
Evie!

15:58.340 --> 15:59.275
Where are you going?

15:59.300 --> 16:00.755
Mr. Petrie gave us a choice...

16:00.780 --> 16:02.795
go to college or join a search party.

16:02.959 --> 16:06.173
Evie, have you any idea
how embarrassing that was?

16:06.289 --> 16:07.445
Sitting there with my boss,

16:07.471 --> 16:09.715
finding out my daughter's
concealed potential evidence.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.395
I knew if I told you about
the car, you'd go bat-shit,

16:11.420 --> 16:12.955
which is exactly what you're doing.

16:12.980 --> 16:16.940
There is somebody in our town
killing people.

16:17.860 --> 16:19.315
So, what have you done about Marr?

16:19.340 --> 16:20.475
I'm sorry?

16:20.500 --> 16:22.395
- Have you arrested him?
- I'm not going to discuss this.

16:22.420 --> 16:23.955
Jonjo knew something. Now he's missing.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.235
Have you even searched Marr's house?

16:25.260 --> 16:28.035
Evie, go back to college
or join a search party.

16:28.060 --> 16:29.195
Don't stand there haranguing me

16:29.220 --> 16:31.146
about things you know bugger-all about.

17:04.874 --> 17:06.819
Mate, I wouldn't go in there.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.194
The creature will get you.

17:09.391 --> 17:10.934
Ooooh!

17:13.457 --> 17:14.875
Uh, sorry to bother you.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.555
We're taking mouth swabs from every male

17:16.579 --> 17:19.557
that was born between 1973 and 1993.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.146
Is Jordan Whitehead at home?

17:22.740 --> 17:24.300
Yes. Come in.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.094
You didn't know?

17:39.020 --> 17:41.435
Uh, yeah. No, I-I knew.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.715
I just...

17:42.833 --> 17:44.404
But you didn't know
it would be like this.

17:47.180 --> 17:48.239
No.

17:49.340 --> 17:50.620
Will I do it?

17:52.500 --> 17:54.100
I'm a qualified nurse.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.217
You stick the kettle on.

17:57.671 --> 17:58.866
We'll have some tea.

18:00.860 --> 18:01.820
Yeah.

18:17.060 --> 18:18.955
Let go!

18:19.089 --> 18:20.458
Baxter.

18:21.993 --> 18:23.353
Baxter!

18:33.940 --> 18:35.478
Sit down.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.021
You enjoy that?

18:50.798 --> 18:52.021
Sorry.

18:53.178 --> 18:55.237
You not think you should've
grown out of it by now?

18:55.660 --> 18:56.710
Don't know.

18:59.980 --> 19:02.878
Three days ago, I found a dead body.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.035
We have a student missing.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.010
You think I'm in the mood
for shit like this?

19:06.386 --> 19:08.202
Today's the day you change.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.875
Stop picking on Dessie.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.976
Start thinking about your future.

19:16.483 --> 19:17.917
Future's sorted.

19:21.140 --> 19:22.780
I'll be running the gift shop.

19:25.018 --> 19:27.147
Emporium of Nessie-related crap.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.001
My old man's not got long.

19:33.307 --> 19:34.579
It is what it is.

19:38.246 --> 19:41.420
He suffered a cerebral aneurysm
two years ago.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.167
Is that them there?

19:43.578 --> 19:44.813
Yeah.

19:44.940 --> 19:48.675
That was at the hospital,
just after Kieran was born.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.459
Jordan looks happy.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.400
He didn't know the road ahead.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.608
Jonjo?

21:42.640 --> 21:44.014
Bethan.

23:23.009 --> 23:24.278
Hello?

23:37.856 --> 23:39.146
Hello?

24:42.196 --> 24:44.028
Oh, hello, Officer. I've had a break-in.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.115
It's, uh, Dr. Simon Marr.

24:48.140 --> 24:52.460
14 Sycamore Gardens, Lochnafoy.

24:54.676 --> 24:56.355
Yeah, well, I was just
dropping my daughter off.

24:56.380 --> 25:00.100
And, um, when I returned,
my front door...

25:05.580 --> 25:06.780
Hey!

25:18.180 --> 25:19.700
<i>Are you there?</i>

25:20.660 --> 25:22.275
<i>Mr. Marr, are you there?</i>

25:22.300 --> 25:23.540
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

25:24.580 --> 25:25.980
<i>Hello?</i>

25:29.586 --> 25:31.229
Hi. Um...

25:32.060 --> 25:33.635
Yes, sorry.

25:33.660 --> 25:36.540
Uh, there h-hasn't been a break-in.

25:59.038 --> 26:00.925
Have you recovered from your ordeal?

26:01.639 --> 26:02.958
I'm fine.

26:05.970 --> 26:07.690
You don't play piano, do you?

26:10.003 --> 26:11.292
No.

26:12.201 --> 26:14.012
But you did know Niall Swift?

26:33.410 --> 26:36.079
Have you any idea
the damage you've done?

26:36.706 --> 26:39.585
I've just been to see
Ken and Nicole Patterson.

26:39.722 --> 26:42.945
You not give a thought for their
feelings before spouting off?

26:43.311 --> 26:44.785
A reporter asked me a legit question.

26:44.810 --> 26:47.184
- I answered it.
- Wasn't your job to answer it!

26:48.123 --> 26:51.825
I've still got to live here
when you've fucked off.

26:56.090 --> 26:57.530
Can you give us the room?

26:58.650 --> 27:00.285
- Look, I've been to the lab...
- Now.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.293
I'm not sacking anybody.

27:21.570 --> 27:22.905
What he did was unprofessional...

27:22.930 --> 27:25.785
He's compromised the case.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.020
He called it right.

27:27.473 --> 27:29.090
We're dealing with a serial killer.

27:29.921 --> 27:33.305
When D.S. Redford found
the sliver of brain,

27:33.330 --> 27:36.197
it was in a plastic bag
smeared with blood.

27:36.690 --> 27:38.806
The blood didn't match the brain.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.400
But it did match the heart.

27:42.149 --> 27:43.877
You still think it's a coincidence?

27:44.914 --> 27:48.865
Now, whatever community panic
or press onslaught ensues,

27:48.890 --> 27:50.305
we'll just have to handle that.

27:50.330 --> 27:53.265
It still doesn't exonerate Albrighton.

27:53.290 --> 27:56.065
If Jonjo Patterson isn't found,
people are going to want to know

27:56.090 --> 27:59.082
why <i>you</i> didn't alert
the community sooner.

27:59.422 --> 28:01.720
You are going to need my support.

28:35.370 --> 28:37.290
Hey, Annie!

28:38.890 --> 28:39.985
Hey, Don.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.745
I just had a couple of questions.

28:41.770 --> 28:43.625
Aye, just give me a second.

28:43.650 --> 28:45.290
I'll let the wife know you're here.

28:50.090 --> 28:51.267
Hey!

28:52.022 --> 28:53.271
Thanks.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.970
I, uh, heard you with Smilie.
Fight my corner.

28:57.650 --> 28:58.937
So, listen, listen.

29:00.450 --> 29:02.865
I went to the lab. The process worked.

29:02.890 --> 29:04.810
I know. They sent me the images.

29:06.951 --> 29:09.362
You know, I really thought this
was going to be a great moment.

29:09.739 --> 29:10.933
For your book?

29:11.792 --> 29:13.597
For the investigation.

29:14.090 --> 29:16.745
Is it because I won't let you
screw up my life anymore?

29:16.770 --> 29:18.471
Is that why you want to screw up my job?

29:21.321 --> 29:25.150
If that's what you think,
why'd you keep me on the team?

29:25.570 --> 29:27.274
I'm trying to figure that out.

29:36.237 --> 29:39.041
I went into Marr's house
to look for Jonjo.

29:39.337 --> 29:41.145
- Right.
- Our friend?

29:41.170 --> 29:42.890
I don't need you judging me.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.131
He had photos of Bethan on his laptop.

29:48.450 --> 29:50.513
- Kieran, Dr. Marr...
- Yeah, I heard you.

29:51.496 --> 29:53.166
Does that not creep you out?

29:54.290 --> 29:56.048
Bethan was the doc's babysitter.

29:56.930 --> 29:58.923
You need to let this go, Velma.

29:59.313 --> 30:00.785
- Velma?
- The dumpy one out of...

30:00.810 --> 30:02.770
Yes, smart-arse, I know who she is.

30:09.263 --> 30:11.265
I couldn't tell you
the last time we saw anyone.

30:11.290 --> 30:12.505
It's the back of beyond up here.

30:12.530 --> 30:14.565
You know Jonjo Patterson's missing?

30:15.328 --> 30:17.345
No, we'd no idea. How long?

30:17.370 --> 30:18.385
Day and a half.

30:18.768 --> 30:20.825
Bethan used to be quite friendly
with him.

30:20.850 --> 30:22.530
I mean, not close, but...

30:23.650 --> 30:26.185
The reason I'm here, first,
to say thanks for helping Evie

30:26.210 --> 30:29.705
but also to get a description
of the car that was chasing her.

30:29.730 --> 30:30.825
I'm not going to be much use there.

30:30.850 --> 30:33.334
The driver had his headlights
on full beam.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.105
Why were you out there?

30:36.437 --> 30:37.823
Why was I out there?

30:38.513 --> 30:39.796
It's my land.

30:40.122 --> 30:41.677
He heard the wolf.

30:41.829 --> 30:43.625
I was out there to blow its head off.

30:43.913 --> 30:44.970
I wish I had.

30:46.014 --> 30:47.923
It's had three of our sheep.

30:53.570 --> 30:54.850
I thought you were on your own.

30:56.050 --> 30:57.370
It'll be the wind.

30:57.711 --> 30:59.144
I should take a look.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.385
It's an old house.

31:00.410 --> 31:02.227
You get noises like that all the time.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.240
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I just sat here.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.345
It'll be nothing.

31:25.130 --> 31:26.465
That's Bethan's room.

31:26.490 --> 31:28.785
She's coming back after her exams.

31:28.810 --> 31:30.050
For the summer.

31:34.096 --> 31:35.976
It must've been the wind.

31:36.850 --> 31:37.865
Caught the door.

32:11.671 --> 32:13.465
I saw Annie going into your house today.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.524
Sorry?

32:14.690 --> 32:17.650
Today I saw Annie going into your house.

32:22.210 --> 32:24.658
A DNA test.
They're doing the whole village.

32:25.864 --> 32:27.495
Can we have a word?

32:31.175 --> 32:32.284
There we go.

32:32.789 --> 32:34.648
Tell them about your encounter
with Nessie.

32:37.490 --> 32:39.945
Sir, you're a tour boat operator.

32:39.970 --> 32:41.385
<i>Are you concerned for your business?</i>

32:41.410 --> 32:42.637
<i>Why would I be?</i>

32:43.075 --> 32:45.305
<i>You don't think these
reports of a serial killer</i>

32:45.330 --> 32:47.547
<i>are going to keep tourists
away from Loch Ness?</i>

32:47.810 --> 32:49.145
<i>If it was true,</i>

32:49.170 --> 32:51.490
<i>business would be the least
of my concerns.</i>

32:53.310 --> 32:55.499
<i>Sir, you're a tour boat operator.</i>

32:56.330 --> 32:57.367
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:57.650 --> 32:59.185
<i>This news of a serial killer,</i>

32:59.210 --> 33:01.610
<i>do you think it'll affect trade?</i>

33:02.770 --> 33:03.865
<i>It might boost it.</i>

33:03.890 --> 33:05.032
Dolly.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.820
Okay.

33:30.940 --> 33:32.031
Thank you.

33:35.460 --> 33:39.655
Forensic proof we are
hunting a serial killer.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.408
These bastards don't stop. <i>We</i> stop <i>them.</i>

33:44.340 --> 33:48.875
Evidence we found in the
newspaper found on Carn Mohr.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.315
As you all know,

33:50.340 --> 33:54.197
different inks respond to
different wavelengths of light.

33:54.500 --> 33:59.352
Infrared filter was able to
pick out traces of felt-tip pen.

33:59.378 --> 34:04.897
These traces were enhanced,
enlarged, and reversed.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.475
The police graphologist believes

34:08.500 --> 34:10.435
the handwriting is distinctive enough

34:10.460 --> 34:14.399
to give us grounds to detain
a suspect if we get a match.

34:15.330 --> 34:18.395
We <i>could</i> be looking at
the killer's handwriting.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.514
<i>Could</i> be.

34:19.849 --> 34:23.246
With this in mind,
we've organized a town meeting.

34:23.871 --> 34:26.074
Uh, yeah. To get into the hall,

34:26.100 --> 34:28.915
fill out your name and address
on this form,

34:28.940 --> 34:30.379
one square per letter.

34:30.505 --> 34:32.146
Like a crossword.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.995
Our stated objectives...

34:35.020 --> 34:36.955
to open up lines of communication,

34:36.980 --> 34:38.355
give safety advice.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.340
It's locals only.

34:45.420 --> 34:47.554
As you can see, a strong turnout

34:47.580 --> 34:49.235
from the people of Lochnafoy.

34:49.260 --> 34:51.364
The question everyone is asking,

34:51.391 --> 34:54.719
"What's being done
to secure our safety?"

35:03.980 --> 35:05.340
Enjoy your drive?

35:06.700 --> 35:09.031
I bet you that left skid marks.

35:10.140 --> 35:11.266
Ken.

35:12.140 --> 35:13.706
It's all right. They're with me.

35:13.980 --> 35:15.220
Thank you.

35:16.020 --> 35:17.420
- Thanks.
- Okay.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.969
D.S. Redford to control.

36:10.180 --> 36:11.795
Message for D.C.I. Quigley.

36:11.820 --> 36:13.755
I'm on the road above
the McGrellish farm.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.115
<i>Message and location noted.</i>

36:15.140 --> 36:17.246
There's a trailer up here.
I'm going to take a look.

36:17.272 --> 36:18.272
<i>Copy that.</i>

36:57.977 --> 36:59.417
Hello? Police!

37:28.780 --> 37:29.900
Shit!

37:32.380 --> 37:33.955
We organized this meeting

37:33.980 --> 37:35.715
as soon as we established a link

37:35.740 --> 37:37.715
between the murder of Niall Swift

37:37.740 --> 37:39.395
and the heart found on the loch shore.

37:40.740 --> 37:44.155
The purpose is to ensure your safety

37:44.180 --> 37:45.910
and to answer any of your questions.

37:45.936 --> 37:47.044
Annie?

37:47.580 --> 37:49.515
I'm getting a signal from Jonjo's phone.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.115
I think it's coming
from the village hall.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.955
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.155
Okay. See you then.

37:54.180 --> 37:55.235
...in Inverness.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.835
This is a major investigation,

37:57.860 --> 37:59.620
and the Scottish Highlands Police...

38:25.660 --> 38:29.595
There's an Incident Caravan
on Croft Street.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.355
It's staffed 24 hours a day.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.515
All visits are welcome.

38:33.540 --> 38:37.355
Please report anything...
people, vehicles.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.926
Come on. Shit! Shit!

38:46.460 --> 38:47.755
Stupid...

38:55.580 --> 38:57.875
Stop, stop! Stop!

38:57.900 --> 38:58.980
Police!

39:01.940 --> 39:04.475
Police. I need you to take me
to Lochnafoy village hall.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.562
Thank you.

39:14.740 --> 39:17.355
Some of you sitting here,
whether you realize it or not,

39:17.380 --> 39:19.420
will have information...

39:33.620 --> 39:35.235
Quiet, please!

39:35.260 --> 39:37.835
There are people waiting to be heard!

39:37.860 --> 39:39.915
What are you doing about the wolf?

39:42.540 --> 39:43.675
When I said "any questions,"

39:43.700 --> 39:45.875
I meant any relevant questions.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.795
We're a small-town community.

39:47.820 --> 39:50.835
If we stop trusting each other,
the killer has won.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.075
The killer wins by killing.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.915
It's less frequent in here.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.804
I'll talk to them.

39:57.830 --> 40:00.045
- What's happened?
- It's okay.

40:00.071 --> 40:01.526
No, Frank. Don't.

40:01.552 --> 40:03.555
How long have you known
the murders are connected?

40:03.580 --> 40:04.885
It was confirmed this afternoon.

40:07.060 --> 40:08.195
D.S. Redford, can you tell us

40:08.220 --> 40:09.841
what was discussed in the meeting?

40:09.867 --> 40:10.912
Back off.

40:10.938 --> 40:13.233
Stop this! Can you stop this?

40:27.802 --> 40:29.042
I need this open!

40:45.100 --> 40:47.235
If I could have
everybody's attention, please?

40:47.260 --> 40:49.788
If I could have everybody's
attention, please!

40:50.220 --> 40:54.675
Can I ask... Can I ask,
please, why I was subjected

40:54.700 --> 40:58.167
to an aggressive interrogation
by one of your officers?

40:58.278 --> 41:00.075
I-I'm sure you are aware

41:00.100 --> 41:01.915
that we have a complaints system...

41:01.940 --> 41:03.555
Don't worry. I've gone over your head.

41:03.580 --> 41:05.675
There are people that are in this town

41:05.700 --> 41:07.835
who are using events
for their own advantage.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.435
This won't be forgotten.

41:11.980 --> 41:14.755
Don't worry. I won't be long.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.955
No!

41:37.980 --> 41:39.675
No!

41:39.700 --> 41:41.115
Jonjo!

41:43.580 --> 41:44.700
No.

41:45.731 --> 41:46.731
Jonjo!

41:47.940 --> 41:49.355
Jonjo!

41:49.380 --> 41:50.315
Oh, Jonjo.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.275
D.S. Redford to control.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.795
I'm on Canal Road.

41:53.820 --> 41:56.033
Get those cameras back! Back!

41:56.688 --> 41:58.155
Code 26.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.703
Full scenes of crime
and uniform for cordon.

42:05.740 --> 42:07.700
No!

42:22.797 --> 42:26.162
We used to call Jonjo
one of the special ones.

42:27.038 --> 42:29.516
He's a murderer, Annie.

42:29.542 --> 42:32.874
- You've been sticking your nose in.
- I wanted to help him!

42:32.900 --> 42:35.100
Do we have permission
to search your house?

42:35.140 --> 42:37.020
Whoa, whoa!

42:37.060 --> 42:39.380
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Is this your handwriting?

42:39.647 --> 42:41.270
- You lied!
- Agh!

42:43.060 --> 42:44.060
Tench?

42:44.100 --> 42:47.300
I don't know how fucking clearer
I have to make it!

42:47.511 --> 42:48.744
Leave me alone.

42:52.540 --> 42:53.700
Murderer.

42:56.538 --> 42:59.088
