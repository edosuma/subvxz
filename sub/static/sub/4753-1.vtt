02:41.829 --> 02:45.599
Ok then, you're late again.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.701
One more time, and you're gone.

02:52.573 --> 02:56.244
Dad's gonna be pissed off, mate.
Yeah, righto.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.125
Got a minute?

03:14.762 --> 03:16.630
When we're outside.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.066
You got any teaching jobs
going at the moment?

03:19.132 --> 03:22.202
I told you when you quit, no second
chances. That was two years ago.

03:22.270 --> 03:26.440
I can't keep workin' here, waitin' to
fall into one of those bloody machines.

03:26.507 --> 03:29.277
Be at my place tomorrow.
3:00. Sharp.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.045
What for? You'll see.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.981
And bring both your shoes.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.387
**

03:39.453 --> 03:42.590
What are you doin' tomorrow?
I don't know. Stuff. Why?

03:42.656 --> 03:45.459
I was gonna drop by Walter's.
I don't know. Want to come?

03:45.526 --> 03:47.094
What?

03:47.160 --> 03:50.230
Give you a ride.
Whoop-de-fuckin'-do.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.468
I wonder how those girls
have matured.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.757
**

04:19.293 --> 04:21.428
Thanks, right.

04:28.201 --> 04:32.373
I thought I said 3:00. Yeah, uh, sorry,
the, uh... the traffic was a shocker.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.208
Well, put your shoes on
and get warmed up.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.244
All right, everyone to the bar.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.380
What am I doing here?
Just go with it.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.415
Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.482
I never thought I'd see you
guys... You still here?

04:43.517 --> 04:46.454
Walter's the only one who'll give him
a job. You guys. Good to see ya.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.623
Place is exactly the same, huh?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.625
No, mate, some things
have improved.

04:51.692 --> 04:55.796
Come on. Lift those legs.
Make it snappy. Snappy!

04:55.863 --> 04:58.966
Keep your taps clean.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.001
Bloody prick.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.236
All right, give
me a nice clean finish.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.373
Five, six, seven, eight.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.010
You want to improvise,
you do it in your own time.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.880
Bit rusty, aren't you, mate?

05:12.946 --> 05:16.417
Yeah. All right, take
five, everybody.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.419
Didn't think you guys
would turn up for this.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.421
Turn up for what exactly?

05:20.488 --> 05:24.091
Last week, Walter got a call from a guy
he tapped with before his accident.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.561
Anyway, this guy's done a lot of big
shows, you see... Spit it out, Gus.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.864
He's auditioning people
for a new tap show in Sydney.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.468
You beauty. What a waste of time.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.637
Then again, maybe not.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.707
- Yeah, that's the hairdressing chick.
- Are we next?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.909
- She just opened a salon on Darby Street.
- Sweet.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.778
- She moved up from Wagga not that long ago.
- Hey, glamour.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.749
Listen up, everybody.
Gather round.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.785
I'd like to introduce you
to Gerard Ball.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.388
Gerard's Anthony Ford's
choreographer.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.690
This is a great opportunity
for you all.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.560
Please, give him your best.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.096
Keep it simple and no improvising.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.032
I got it covered.

06:05.098 --> 06:08.669
You haven't got it covered.
This guy's a professional.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.639
Easy, tiger. Okay,
I want everybody to do this.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.375
And keep it going. Keep it going.

06:21.515 --> 06:25.118
Who are they? The Okden brothers.
Steer clear.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.921
Arms straight.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.225
Okay. Stop there.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.327
Everyone I point to, step forward.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.464
You, you, you, you,

06:36.530 --> 06:39.132
you, you, you, you, you.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.769
- There you go.
- The rest, you can go. Thanks for coming.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.137
Okay, I want you to do this.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.581
Okay. Five, six, seven and...

06:58.652 --> 07:01.188
Stop. Stop. Stop!

07:01.254 --> 07:03.190
Stop! Whoo!

07:05.025 --> 07:07.595
Why would I hire you if you can't
follow a simple direction?

07:07.661 --> 07:09.663
Because I'm bloody good.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.901
Thanks for coming.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.436
In fact, thank you all for coming.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.872
I've seen enough.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.743
Fifteen years of tap class
for a... oh, 12-second audition.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.312
You owe me a schooner for this.
Yep. Whatever.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.482
Before you leave, clean
up the studio and put the CDs away.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.784
G'day, I'm Mitch. And you're... Hi.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.188
I prefer redheads anyway.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.060
Well, I thought you were great.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.065
- I'm Linda.
- Sean.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.504
That spin you did, I'd love
to be able to do that.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.993
Well, well. If it isn't
Prancer the Tap Dancer.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.996
Nice slippers.
What do you want, Huey?

08:16.063 --> 08:18.532
Well, we miss having you around.
Don't we, fellas?

08:18.599 --> 08:21.969
Yeah, mate. We miss ya. Yeah. We need
your expertise. We want you to come back.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.437
So you can keep ripping us off?
Oh, geez, mate.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.840
Oh, geez, that hurt.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.978
Come here.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.681
No, come here. Come here. It's all right.
Come here.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.619
You wanna work for me, stay out of
my fuckin' business, all right?

08:38.686 --> 08:40.621
Yep. Got it?

08:40.688 --> 08:42.222
Mm-hmm. Good.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.559
But I don't work for you
no more, you ass-wipe.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.897
Ah.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.732
Hey!

08:51.799 --> 08:54.034
Oi! Don't you fuckin' dare!

08:54.101 --> 08:56.236
Then fuck off!

08:59.506 --> 09:01.308
See you later, pretty boy. Yeah?

09:13.520 --> 09:16.624
See you later, dickhead.
Next time.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.598
- What was that about?
- You all right?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.767
Yeah. Yeah.

09:26.834 --> 09:30.070
Good, thanks. So, does this
happen after every audition?

09:31.271 --> 09:33.173
Can I have a word?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.076
Hey, help me out with him, yeah?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.578
Shut the front door.
Sean's got it.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.581
Hey, ugly. Yeah, good game?

09:41.649 --> 09:43.917
Yeah, good.
You should've seen this.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.353
Yeah? They'll run the replay in a minute.
Beautiful.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.958
Dad, guess what. Get out of
the way of the television.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.094
Dad, guess what. Sean's got a
job in Sydney tap dancing.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.063
What? 800 a week.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.642
- We can finally get some peace, eh?
- I thought you gave it up.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.434
Yeah, old Hopalong Walter had
an audition today. Oh, did he?

10:01.501 --> 10:04.237
You're not goin'.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.539
Dad, this is a real break.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.710
Yeah, what happens when it finishes?
You're back up here on the dole.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.544
Come on, Dad. Shut up, Mitchell.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.580
It's his life. Shut up.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.884
- Eight blokes have been retrenched this month.
- Exactly.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.986
There's no security
at the steelworks anymore.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.821
More reason to hang on
to what you've got.

10:20.888 --> 10:24.792
When are you gonna get it into your head that
anything would be better than what I do now?

10:24.858 --> 10:28.862
And when are you gonna get it through
your thick skull that you're not goin'?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.699
Yeah, try and stop me.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.336
You've never even seen me tap.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.115
And don't smoke that shit out
the front, boxhead. Yeah.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.354
Sorry I swore.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.324
This is great. You piss him off, and
then you piss off.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.994
I wonder who he's gonna take it out on, eh?
Thank you very much.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.333
Get off! Get off. You'll scratch the Duco.
Oh, Christ.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.136
Here, a present.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.641
You should come with me.
I'm not interested, mate.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.044
I reckon I could get you in.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.012
No.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.450
Come on. It'll be a blast.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.420
We've always wanted to get out
of this place. No, you have.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.791
Well, what are you gonna do? What?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.726
Work in the steelworks
forever and ever. Amen.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.895
No, I've got my own plans.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.097
Oh, yeah?

11:37.164 --> 11:39.967
You gonna deck this out as a
cubbyhouse again, are ya? Shut up.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.569
Yeah? What, and rent it out
for five cents?

11:42.635 --> 11:44.471
- Get fucked. Yeah?
- Yeah, what then?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.840
Well, seriously, I'm saving
up to buy my own truck.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.377
All right, I figure
that I'll start with one rig...

11:50.443 --> 11:53.613
and see how it goes... Well, come with me.
It's 800 bucks a week.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.715
800. Even if you could get me in,

11:55.783 --> 11:59.252
I'm not giving everything up for a job
that's only gonna last three months.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.488
Dad's right.
What do we do when it's over?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.090
Improvise.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.308
What are you doing here?

12:21.374 --> 12:24.311
It's 6:00. Thought I might
finish your lesson.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.413
You been tapping long?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.849
Nah. Just a couple of years.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.218
How come I haven't seen you
there before at class?

12:31.284 --> 12:33.453
I quit when I had to
work at the steelworks.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.789
Can't make a living
out of tap in this town.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.458
Why does Walter keep churning out
all these amazing tappers...

12:38.525 --> 12:40.693
if there's nothing
for 'em to do afterwards?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.762
He makes a few bucks.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.764
He's a bloody great teacher. Yeah.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.766
He just loves tap.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.701
I'd forgotten
how much I missed it...

12:48.768 --> 12:51.571
You know, when you're on a roll
and you forget all the bullshit,

12:51.638 --> 12:53.473
everything that's pissing you off.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.408
It's great.

12:55.475 --> 12:59.679
So, you opened that salon, huh?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.849
Hey. Watch this.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.520
- How's that?
- That's pretty good.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.092
Bullshit. You're just saying
that to get into my pants.

13:12.159 --> 13:16.596
No, I'm not.
Well, yeah, I am actually.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.598
No! No, no, no.
You're pretty good.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.567
No. I've got terrible timing.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.170
Well, let's see if we can take
those training wheels off.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.540
Okay? Tap, step.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.843
Tap, step. Exactly.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.496
See? I told you so.

13:49.562 --> 13:53.166
Just my luck. I'm about
to leave and you turn up.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.801
I told you I had terrible timing.

13:54.868 --> 13:58.305
There's no chance of you, uh,
opening up a barbershop in Sydney?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.207
Absolutely.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.175
Once I take over Newcastle,
Sydney's next.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.844
World domination, huh? Hmm.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.462
Come on.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.034
Up, up, up, up!

14:29.869 --> 14:32.405
Go on, get it out! Get it out!

14:32.472 --> 14:33.974
Yeah! Come on!

14:37.044 --> 14:38.778
Jesus, Sean!

14:38.845 --> 14:41.681
When are you gonna learn how to tackle?
He did a goose step.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.750
Take 'em down now. Boys.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.521
- Yeah.
- Good game, guys.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.557
Hey. You coming to the pub?
Can't do it.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.859
He's got a job in Sydney tap dancing.
They payin'?

14:52.926 --> 14:55.462
Three month contract. I thought
you gave it up when we all did.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.464
Walter had an audition.
He didn't invite me.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.666
That's 'cause you tap
the way you tackle.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.135
- Come on, Col.
- Travelin'.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.071
Maybe you should practice
tackling her.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.374
- She's got you by the short and curlies.
- Get stuffed, the lot of ya.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.476
She hates me. You shouldn't
have bonked her sister.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.744
It was her cousin. It was
three years ago. Whatever.

15:11.811 --> 15:14.481
See ya, fellas. See ya, mate.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.616
Hey.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.519
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.721
Good luck in Sydney, mate.
Show 'em how it's done.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.357
Thanks, mate. Yeah. No worries.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.518
This is a great place. Yeah.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.587
Yeah, my mom used to bring
me here when I was a kid.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.859
You must miss her.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.129
Yeah.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.666
She would have liked you though.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.612
You're leaving tomorrow.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.250
Let's not rush this.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.989
Okay. Okay.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.903
All right, Dad.
I'll see you, then.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.506
Yeah, righto. Have a safe trip.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.475
Yeah, thanks, I will.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.711
What a warm send-off.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.450
Hey, don't forget to speak to Gerard.
I think he really liked me.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.053
Yeah. Well, don't hold your breath.
You can still come.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.391
- Go on, fuck off.
- All right. Good luck with your scheme.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.162
I'll be there on opening night.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.364
You're just saying that
to get in my pants.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.506
Mmm.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.942
All right, well, um,
I'll give you a call.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.778
And come down before that, like,
on a weekend, when I'm settled in.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.281
I'd love to.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.598
Hi, mate. You all right?

17:45.665 --> 17:47.667
You off then? Yeah.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.937
Don't screw it up.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.706
Keep it simple and no improvising.
Keep it simple. No improvising.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.444
Get out of here. I got it covered.
Don't worry.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.285
**

18:11.424 --> 18:15.495
* I see the city and it
isn't what it used to be *

18:15.562 --> 18:18.798
* A million houses goin' up
and down in front of me *

18:18.865 --> 18:20.967
* No time to let
the concrete set *

18:21.033 --> 18:22.902
* Before it's broken up again *

18:22.969 --> 18:27.540
* Don't care if it's historic
Don't really care at all *

18:30.042 --> 18:33.613
* A hidden landscape on the
brink of a development *

18:33.680 --> 18:36.683
* A protest rally never
satisfied with development *

18:36.749 --> 18:38.751
* Both striving
for a perfect world *

18:38.818 --> 18:40.787
* Each having their own opinions *

18:40.853 --> 18:45.325
* It's all a sequence
It goes on and on *

18:51.431 --> 18:53.600
* All torn down *

18:55.134 --> 18:57.204
* All torn down **

19:55.228 --> 19:57.930
Stop. Stop! It's sloppy.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.932
First positions.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.573
Hey. You're doing well.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.442
Just two things.
Don't upstage Anthony.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.245
Huh? During the
routine, stay in line.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.282
And, uh,

20:15.348 --> 20:17.417
that's Anthony's fiancée.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.953
Absolutely no idea.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.457
Now I want it right in this little
crease here. Is Sebastian coming?

20:24.524 --> 20:28.361
He's such a piker. Yes, Sara.
I know where to put it, okay?

20:31.298 --> 20:33.232
Come on. We're on.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.108
Yeah. No, we're gonna get a cab.
See you there. All right, bye.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.143
What?

20:44.210 --> 20:47.246
The business line is not for personal
calls. Is not for personal calls.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.382
Okay. Okay.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.719
- What is wrong with you? You've been a pain in the ass lately.
- Bullshit.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.021
- Sara?
- Total pain in the ass.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.424
Well, sorry, girls. I've been
trying to balance the books.

20:57.490 --> 21:01.060
It's not easy, you know. Didn't I tell you
to stay away from the Okden brothers?

21:01.127 --> 21:04.397
Don't start. Don't tell me you've
got the hots for old doorknob Sean.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.734
Doorknob? Yeah.
Everybody's had a turn.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.970
You know.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.910
- Hey, has he rung yet?
- No, I guess he's just really busy.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.447
Well, why don't you ring him?
'Cause I don't have his number.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.482
He's been gone three weeks
and hasn't rung?

21:22.549 --> 21:25.585
Girl, the guy's finding it
somewhere else.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.453
Ow.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.755
**

21:28.821 --> 21:30.823
We're going out.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.826
No, thanks. I'm not in the mood.

21:33.893 --> 21:37.096
You can't go on
waiting for him to call.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.467
We're going out. We're gonna have a
couple of drinks and a bit of a dance.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.736
It'll be fun. Come on.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.772
You're right.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.410
- Hi, this is Linda.
- And Kim.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.979
Ladies and gentlemen, the beep.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.148
Hi, Linda. It's me.

21:56.215 --> 21:59.586
Uh, I can't believe I'm finally getting
through. Your phone's always busy.

21:59.652 --> 22:04.557
Anyway, I've been pretty flat out, but they're
finally, uh, giving us this weekend off.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.460
So, it'd be great
if you could come down.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.596
Uh, I've got my own place set up,

22:09.662 --> 22:12.298
but, uh, well,
the phone's not on there yet.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.534
So, leave a message
at the theater.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.537
I miss you.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.444
**

22:24.511 --> 22:27.780
How's that new boyfriend?
Yeah, right, Mitch.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.951
Hey.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.020
Boop. Hey.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.955
Hey. How you' doin'?

22:36.022 --> 22:38.491
Hello. How you goin'? I'm goin' good.
Can I buy you a drink?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.660
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Schooner of New.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.829
"I feel like a Tooheys or two."
Or three or four.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.899
Have you heard from Sean? Shit, no.
Excuse my language.

22:49.436 --> 22:52.639
How come you didn't go to Sydney with him?
Tap dancing's not real work.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.708
Yeah, but you like it, don't ya?
Yeah.

22:55.775 --> 22:59.579
I like to surf too, but I'm not
gonna make a living out of it.

22:59.646 --> 23:03.249
Do you reckon Sean's gonna come back to
Newcastle with his tail between his legs?

23:03.315 --> 23:05.351
No. He's never coming back. Eh?

23:05.418 --> 23:07.887
Yeah. Why do you say that?

23:07.954 --> 23:11.558
He's my kid brother, and he's been
wanting to get out of here for years,

23:11.624 --> 23:13.593
and he couldn't face Dad
unless he does well.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.131
**

23:24.737 --> 23:26.673
Slap that bass. Slap those feet.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.511
Slap that bass.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.880
Gonna slap those feet.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.883
**

24:15.922 --> 24:19.425
- - Hey! You're a
bloody little upstart. You're sacked.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.660
- What?
- You heard me.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.795
Now get out of here.

24:25.431 --> 24:28.868
- Oh, you little shit.
- You better leave.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.804
Get him out of here. Everyone's
standin' around. Stop lookin' at me!

24:31.871 --> 24:34.874
* Oh, yeah *

24:34.941 --> 24:36.976
**

24:43.249 --> 24:45.184
Yeah!

24:48.521 --> 24:50.690
Get out.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.764
Whoo-hoo!

24:57.830 --> 25:01.333
- You're a heaps good dancer, eh?
- Oh, you're just saying that.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.637
Linda. Hey, glamour. Wait up.
What's up? What's wrong?

25:04.704 --> 25:06.973
- ** - Nothing.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.341
I'm just not very good
company tonight. Oh.

25:09.408 --> 25:13.079
- One more. One more. One more.
- Ohh.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.214
Here's my favorite song.
I gotta work tomorrow.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.383
They're playing my song. It's mine.
Oh, Mitchell.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.886
Your favorite song?
Yeah, it's my song.

25:19.952 --> 25:23.155
- Yeah.
- * Leave the city far behind *

25:23.222 --> 25:26.959
* Don't need people
with a one-track mind *

25:27.026 --> 25:30.262
* Jealousy takes all their time **

25:32.398 --> 25:35.301
Shit!

25:55.955 --> 25:58.257
What?

26:00.693 --> 26:03.696
Sorry, um, you gotta get up.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.632
Well, good morning to you too.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.343
Hi, Linda. It's me.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.146
Uh, I can't believe
I'm finally getting through.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.048
Your phone's always busy.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.051
Anyway, um, I've been
pretty flat out...

26:31.390 --> 26:33.359
- What's the rush?
- I'm late.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.994
For what? Work.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.063
You'll have to let
yourself out, okay? Okay.

26:38.698 --> 26:41.600
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.167
Fuckin' prick!

27:43.395 --> 27:45.431
You know how cold it is... Fucker!

27:45.497 --> 27:48.167
You fucker! Get off!

27:48.234 --> 27:51.904
Come on. You only just met her, and
you said you weren't comin' back.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.273
- She was fair game.
- Fair game? That's bullshit...

27:54.340 --> 27:56.943
and you know it! What are you gonna do?
Beat me up?

27:57.009 --> 28:00.646
I'm sorry.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.415
I mean... I like her heaps.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.251
Yeah.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.820
She's lovely.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.857
So, how was Sydney?
Did you go to the opera house?

28:11.891 --> 28:13.860
- Hello, sweet.
- What do you want?

28:13.926 --> 28:17.864
- Hmm?
- How... How come you're back?

28:17.930 --> 28:21.400
What do you care? Can I...
Can I talk to you, please?

28:21.467 --> 28:23.402
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- Alone.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.372
If you can fuck him,
you can talk in front of him.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.776
Take it easy. Take it easy? How about
you stay out of this, Mitchell?

28:29.842 --> 28:31.243
- It's always about you.
- What?

28:31.310 --> 28:34.781
Ever since we were kids, it's
always been about you. Yeah.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.793
If something's not about you, you have a
little cry. So many tears I can swim.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.618
Mitchell, shut up!

28:39.685 --> 28:43.355
Hey, listen. Everyone kept saying
that you played around, right?

28:43.422 --> 28:46.158
Oh! And when I didn't... Sara
said you had a bad reputation.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.928
- I didn't hear from you!
- I called!

28:49.929 --> 28:52.064
That many times!

28:52.131 --> 28:55.902
What? You were never
on the fuckin' phone!

28:55.968 --> 28:58.637
I... I thought that you'd...
You'd found someone in Sydney.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.340
Thank you for having such faith in me!
Sean, listen, I'm sorry.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.842
Please...

29:04.343 --> 29:07.079
I'm sorry. Late for
that now, isn't it?

29:10.016 --> 29:12.084
You can have her, mate.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.060
Would you like my jacket?

29:21.127 --> 29:23.830
Just...

29:28.334 --> 29:30.970
- I thought you were in Sydney.
- Didn't work out.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.541
And now John, 40 minutes out.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.676
Move over.

29:37.743 --> 29:39.678
This one's gonna pull up.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.881
Last night's game.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.216
I fell asleep
in front of the telly.

29:45.684 --> 29:49.155
Got pissed in front of the
telly actually.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.757
And tolling the kicks up.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.860
Oh, yes!

29:56.162 --> 29:58.898
One of your old actions, eh, Dad?
Yeah.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.533
Except I was tougher
than that bastard.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.570
You can get your job back,
you know.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.274
I had a talk to Bobby Williams,
asked him not to fill the position.

30:10.877 --> 30:14.280
Yeah, thanks for the support, Dad.

30:14.346 --> 30:17.850
- You screwed up a golden opportunity.
- Can we not talk about it?

30:17.917 --> 30:20.819
- What the hell happened?
- I thought we weren't gonna talk about it.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.063
I'm gonna start my own tap group.

30:33.265 --> 30:36.502
I learned one thing. Me and the
guys are better tappers...

30:36.568 --> 30:38.670
than any of those wankers
I worked with in Sydney.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.173
Have you got any idea
what it takes to put on a show?

30:41.240 --> 30:43.910
Don't worry. I'll improvise.

30:45.777 --> 30:48.180
Startin' now.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.616
Can I use your studio
for rehearsals?

30:52.218 --> 30:55.021
Up, down. A one, two. Good go.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.957
A five, a six, up, down.
A one, a one,

30:58.024 --> 30:59.959
a one, a one,

31:00.026 --> 31:03.395
a one and a two and a three and a
four and a five, six, seven, eight.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.631
Good go. All right, thank you.
Hey, hang on.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.633
I want a word with ya. Hey.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.535
Hey. What are you doing back?

31:09.601 --> 31:12.771
Ooh, long story. All right, Gus, listen.

31:12.838 --> 31:16.275
Basically, I'm starting up a tap
group, and I want you on board.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.310
And you, what's...
What is your name?

31:18.377 --> 31:20.679
Oh, Johnno. Johnno. Johnno.
What do you reckon?

31:20.746 --> 31:22.581
Oh, man, I've got a wage here.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.184
Uh, five, six, seven, eight.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.586
Yeah. Well, you wouldn't
have to quit work.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.022
Down, a one. I mean, we'd
be rehearsing at night.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.624
Up, stage. And a wage?
Walter's pay is crap.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.994
You could make loads of extra money.
Pick 'em up!

31:35.061 --> 31:37.129
Two, three, four.
And you'd be performing.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.999
Yeah, okay. All right, up and
to the corner. Thank you.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.234
Johnno,
you've got nothing to lose.

31:42.301 --> 31:45.771
You're young and you know how to tap
dance, but you need to take the next step,

31:45.837 --> 31:49.508
which is to perform with some guys
who really know how to tap dance.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.545
Sounds a bit risky.
Well, for me it is.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.647
For you, it's not.

31:55.714 --> 31:58.985
Look, you're young. You're still
in school, for Christ sakes.

31:59.051 --> 32:03.422
Mate, this is the best offer you'll ever get.
You can't be Walter's gofer all your life.

32:03.489 --> 32:06.458
And when you're in a show,
girls want to knock you off.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.328
- I'm in.
- What do you say, gofer?

32:09.395 --> 32:12.498
Huh? Girls. All right, travel.

32:12.564 --> 32:16.335
We get to go to Brisbane. We get to go
to Jupiter's Casino, the Gold Coast.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.704
Hey, hey, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Sean.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.539
Let me get this straight, mate.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.075
You waltz in here,
you criticize my job,

32:23.142 --> 32:24.977
and then you expect me
to drop everything...

32:25.044 --> 32:29.615
to join some nonexistent tap troupe
that's gonna tour Queensland?

32:29.681 --> 32:31.650
Yeah, that's about it.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.988
When do we start? Eh?
How about now?

32:36.055 --> 32:38.224
Whoo.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.231
Hey, what kind of drugs
are you on?

32:45.297 --> 32:47.299
You know how I feel
about that shit.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.601
Yeah, I know how you feel
about this shit as well.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.472
If it took off, you wouldn't have
to work here anymore. Hi, Sean.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.474
Well, it's worth a laugh. Yeah.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.676
Yeah, yeah. Real laugh a minute.

32:57.743 --> 33:01.113
Complete strangers wanting to beat me up
because they think I'm some dancing poofter.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.449
Give him a drink, mate.
It's all right.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.418
Don't worry about that, mate.
We know you're straight.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.454
You stare at tits all night. Yeah.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.123
Are you in? Whoo.
Is Mitch doing it?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.359
- No.
- Well, then who?

33:13.425 --> 33:16.695
Uh, a new kid called Johnno, Angus, myself.
Oh, fuckin' Angus.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.965
The guy's a total pain in the ass.
Never shuts the fuck up.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.800
Chat, chat, fuckin' chat.
Yeah, all right.

33:21.867 --> 33:24.503
Worried he's gonna show you up?
I'm heaps better than that prick.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.538
Really? Yeah.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.408
- Show me.
- **

33:29.475 --> 33:31.410
Come on. Dance, you big lug.

33:31.477 --> 33:35.247
* I know that I look
kind of funny *

33:36.482 --> 33:39.485
* Sometimes
I just don't act right *

33:40.719 --> 33:42.221
They're showing you up.

33:42.288 --> 33:46.325
* I'm not a teenage dream
I never made the team *

33:46.392 --> 33:50.096
* Like Frankenstein
I get some people afraid *

33:50.996 --> 33:54.600
* I don't even have to try *

33:54.666 --> 33:57.536
* They cross the street
to pass me by *

33:57.603 --> 33:59.905
Come on! Take it off!

33:59.971 --> 34:03.109
* Come on, tease me **

34:03.175 --> 34:04.175
Are you gonna join?

34:04.210 --> 34:06.145
Don't know. Come on.

34:06.212 --> 34:10.047
All the other guys are doing it. I'm
not making you any long-term promises.

34:10.116 --> 34:13.185
Good man. Right.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.521
Put these on. I want to
see if you're in form.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.975
No. Let me think about it.

35:10.041 --> 35:13.279
Derrick, you look just like the construction
worker from the Village People.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.381
Yeah, right.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.919
Oh, fuck!

35:20.986 --> 35:24.423
You might want to lift your feet a
little too. Your taps sound a bit muddy.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.992
All right, all right. Come on.
Let's take it from the top.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.628
We'll remotely stay in time?

35:29.695 --> 35:31.863
Can you stop fucking about?

35:31.930 --> 35:33.965
Sorry.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.335
Five, six, seven and...

35:45.677 --> 35:47.513
Lookin' flash, boys.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.548
Come on, Col. Time to go.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.583
I better get going. What?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.585
Sorry, guys. We haven't finished.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.288
Colin, fun and games are over.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.391
Well, anybody need a lift?

36:00.326 --> 36:03.262
Why isn't this working?

36:06.865 --> 36:09.968
Now, Sean, I've been thinking about
it, and the fact of the matter is...

36:10.035 --> 36:12.438
The fact is the matter, what?

36:12.504 --> 36:17.075
Our routines are no different to the most basic
stuff tap dancers have always done, mate.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.411
We're just wearing different hats.

36:19.478 --> 36:23.415
Your station, 2HD.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.384
With Summer and Tony this morning.

36:25.451 --> 36:29.154
We've just heard news there's been a major
traffic problem in Hunter Street, Newcastle.

36:29.221 --> 36:32.991
A two-car accident, partially blocking one
lane, causing massive traffic problems.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.560
If you're in that area...

36:34.626 --> 36:37.429
Where were you till all hours?
Out and about.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.166
How much money have you saved
towards the rig?

36:41.233 --> 36:44.603
About 3,000. Mm-hmm.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.750
Still gonna get the late-'80s Kenworth?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.707
They run about 80 grand,
don't they?

36:48.774 --> 36:51.777
Yeah, I reckon if I save about 15,

36:51.843 --> 36:53.679
I can go for a loan.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.715
Hmm. Well, it's only
five grand, but...

36:56.782 --> 36:58.817
I'll throw in the money
that your mother left ya.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.119
I thought we weren't getting
that till we turned 25.

37:01.186 --> 37:04.323
You weren't. But this is for
something worthwhile, isn't it?

37:04.390 --> 37:06.958
That's great. Yeah.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.729
What did I tell you?

37:14.533 --> 37:16.868
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.411
I guess the girls were right.

37:25.477 --> 37:28.079
Didn't take you long
to find someone else, eh?

37:28.146 --> 37:29.981
Oh, Linda, this is
my cousin Annabelle.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.983
Hi. Hello.

37:32.050 --> 37:35.053
Listen, I'm gonna go. Um, thanks. I
hate coming down here on my own.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.524
No worries. Say g'day to your mum, yeah?
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.327
See ya.

37:41.393 --> 37:44.262
You were saying? Sorry.

37:51.803 --> 37:54.139
How much for the extractor? 100.

37:54.205 --> 37:57.343
I've got 90. That's all right.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.519
- Shit!
- You must have a problem with your hearing, Mitchell.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.356
Excuse me? Never fuck
with a man's livelihood.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.494
There's a blue. Hey, boys!
There's a blue on!

38:25.604 --> 38:29.040
How's my tap dancing,
sunshine? Whoo!

38:29.107 --> 38:31.777
You mother...

38:38.283 --> 38:40.386
Take this!

38:40.452 --> 38:43.021
Easy.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.292
Hurry up!

38:47.359 --> 38:49.761
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

38:51.997 --> 38:54.600
Hurry up, you squashed fuck!

38:58.136 --> 39:01.840
I don't know why the hell
I'm helping you! Just go!

39:01.907 --> 39:03.642
Get him! Shut up!

39:03.709 --> 39:05.744
- Turn the fuckin' music up!
- **

39:05.811 --> 39:07.979
Come on. Hit him.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.348
I'll fuckin' kill him.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.084
I got him.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.621
Whoo!

39:27.065 --> 39:29.267
You're fucked! You're fucked!

39:29.334 --> 39:30.602
Hit him! Hit him!

39:34.940 --> 39:36.808
Fucker!

39:36.875 --> 39:39.578
Fucker!

39:40.879 --> 39:42.481
Yeah.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.873
Whoo!

40:07.939 --> 40:09.975
Esther.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.511
You're playing with
the big boys now, son.

40:12.578 --> 40:16.247
I find out you're selling again, I'll
put you out of business for good.

40:16.314 --> 40:20.018
Fuckin' prick! And you watch
it too, you little faggoty cocksucker.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.655
You're a wanker, Huey!

40:28.560 --> 40:30.929
Chilly, eh, boys?

40:38.336 --> 40:40.639
What the fuck was that about?

40:41.607 --> 40:44.476
Tell me! I just lost
my fucking bike.

40:44.543 --> 40:48.013
I've got a business going.
What business?

40:48.079 --> 40:51.282
For the last couple of months, I've been
stealing cars and selling the parts.

40:51.349 --> 40:54.620
You fucking what? And Huey
hasn't taken kindly to it.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.922
Well, what's it to him?

40:56.988 --> 40:59.057
It's what he does.

40:59.124 --> 41:02.628
And I used to work with him,
and he ripped me off and...

41:02.694 --> 41:05.564
Well, now he can get fucked.
Eh, fuck him.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.599
Jesus. Fuck, Mitch!
Oh, settle down.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.601
What if Dad found out?
Settle... Shh.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.670
Settle down. Settle down. Yeah.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.872
Yeah? That fuckin' prick
just nearly ran us down.

41:13.939 --> 41:17.709
It's not for long. Just till I've got enough
money for me rig, and then we're sweet.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.745
No worries.
Christ! You're dreamin'!

41:19.811 --> 41:22.047
You're gonna get yourself
busted or killed!

41:22.113 --> 41:25.283
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Piss it off, mate.
It's bad news.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.753
Oh, whatever. Jesus.

41:27.819 --> 41:32.290
Look, I'm starting my own tap group.
Why don't you do that?

41:32.357 --> 41:33.959
No way. Everyone else is doing it.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.093
Yeah? Mmm.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.864
It's your thing.

44:00.238 --> 44:02.073
Now just think.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.242
Where could you put on
this show for free?

44:09.514 --> 44:11.449
Here?

44:11.516 --> 44:13.651
Yep.

44:13.719 --> 44:16.154
Plenty of room up the end
there for a stage.

44:16.221 --> 44:18.389
Place hasn't been used for months.

44:18.456 --> 44:21.827
I don't think you'd have any trouble
getting permission to use it.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.463
It's not what I had in mind.

44:25.530 --> 44:27.465
Yeah, well,

44:27.532 --> 44:29.667
improvise.

44:32.738 --> 44:34.773
Yeah, all right.
I'll still need...

44:34.840 --> 44:37.375
heaps of money for...

44:37.442 --> 44:39.377
lights, sound, stage.

44:39.444 --> 44:41.579
Yeah.

44:41.646 --> 44:44.015
Don't look at me.

44:46.918 --> 44:50.221
- You want to borrow $4,000 to put on a dancin' show?
- Yeah. Yeah.

44:50.288 --> 44:52.767
You'll get the money back with interest.
I've retrenched 16 men...

44:52.791 --> 44:54.425
in the last two weeks.

44:54.492 --> 44:58.429
All right. You can use the machine
shop, but that's it, all right?

44:58.496 --> 45:00.899
I'm not sponsoring
no fuckin' dancing show.

45:00.966 --> 45:05.303
- And don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
- All right, thanks.

45:08.306 --> 45:11.042
G'day. G'day.

45:11.977 --> 45:15.046
You know the money Mum left me?

45:15.113 --> 45:17.682
Yeah. Could I have it now, please?

45:17.749 --> 45:20.018
What for? Does it matter?

45:20.085 --> 45:22.587
Yeah, of course it matters.

45:22.653 --> 45:24.622
I'm trying to put
a tap group together.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.591
The money's for
something worthwhile.

45:26.657 --> 45:30.095
I'm not gonna let you flush it down the
shit-house on some half-assed dance show.

45:30.161 --> 45:32.406
- But you gave it to Mitch.
- Because your brother's got brains.

45:32.430 --> 45:35.066
He's buying a rig.
Now, that's worthwhile.

45:35.133 --> 45:37.002
So what I wanna do don't matter?

45:37.068 --> 45:39.938
The answer's no, Sean.
Now go back to work.

46:07.966 --> 46:10.201
What are you doing here?

46:10.268 --> 46:12.370
Your dad told me
that I might find you here.

46:12.437 --> 46:15.807
Sean, listen, would you...
Would you just hear me out?

46:15.874 --> 46:21.346
I'm really, really sorry
about what happened.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.348
I was drinking.

46:23.414 --> 46:25.250
I know that's no excuse.

46:26.517 --> 46:28.319
I really screwed up.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.421
It was my brother,
for Christ's sakes.

46:32.523 --> 46:34.893
I'm really sorry.

46:39.097 --> 46:41.099
I thought we had something.

46:41.166 --> 46:43.168
We do.

46:43.234 --> 46:45.670
We do.

46:45.736 --> 46:48.139
S-Sean.

46:50.608 --> 46:52.510
I love you.

46:52.577 --> 46:55.013
I love you.

47:23.341 --> 47:26.577
But if we give it like
a graduated cut up the side,

47:26.644 --> 47:30.681
you're gonna free up all that lovely
curl that you've got naturally.

47:30.748 --> 47:35.186
It's gonna look beautiful. You still
want to be able to wear it up to work.

47:35.253 --> 47:39.057
When's the wedding date? A couple months?

47:39.124 --> 47:41.092
I think it'll look really nice.

47:41.159 --> 47:43.128
Can I have a word?
Mitchell, I'm working.

47:43.194 --> 47:46.197
It's just for a sec, sweet.
Just for a sec.

47:47.732 --> 47:50.335
Just for a sec. Excuse me.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.272
Mitchell, look out.

47:54.339 --> 47:56.707
Oh, my God. You're off your face.
Nah, no.

47:56.774 --> 48:00.378
Look, you don't think Sean's
gonna hang around, do ya?

48:00.445 --> 48:02.647
What? Do ya?

48:02.713 --> 48:05.984
Yeah, I do. No. I mean, like,

48:06.051 --> 48:10.121
until he gets another chance, and then he's
gonna be gone just like a rat up a drainpipe.

48:10.188 --> 48:12.557
You better leave. I've
gotta get back to work.

48:12.623 --> 48:17.395
I should... should just forget
it ever happened, eh?

48:17.462 --> 48:19.430
Yeah.

48:19.497 --> 48:23.068
I can't. I love ya.

48:29.474 --> 48:32.210
Look.

48:32.277 --> 48:37.882
We can be friends, okay?
But that's it.

48:37.949 --> 48:40.885
Come on, mate.
Go home and sleep it off.

48:40.952 --> 48:42.988
Go on.

48:51.029 --> 48:54.132
Hey, Sean! Sean.

48:54.199 --> 48:57.568
This is my cousin Newt. His
band wants to be in the show.

48:59.204 --> 49:03.008
**

49:04.109 --> 49:06.577
You think Bon Jovi's
music's appropriate?

49:06.644 --> 49:09.314
He trained at the Con.

49:09.380 --> 49:11.416
The Conservatory of Music
in Sydney?

49:11.482 --> 49:15.987
No. Connolly's School of
Guitar on Baker Street.

49:16.054 --> 49:18.523
He'll do it for free.

49:18.589 --> 49:20.491
We could use a live band.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.727
**

49:28.699 --> 49:32.137
** Something like this.

49:40.545 --> 49:42.447
All right!

49:44.882 --> 49:47.085
**

50:38.836 --> 50:41.005
* Yep *

50:41.072 --> 50:43.174
- Car bloke, mate?
- Yeah.

50:43.241 --> 50:45.976
This it? Yeah. Two-liter turbo.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.246
I'll take it. Cool.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.649
Boys!

50:54.552 --> 50:56.821
Good evening, son.
Good to have you back.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.689
All right, get the shit.

51:08.433 --> 51:10.401
* Rack 'em up, Jim
It's your break *

51:10.468 --> 51:12.537
* Set 'em up, Max It's my shout *

51:12.603 --> 51:15.606
* You know, I really could go
a round or three *

51:17.342 --> 51:21.112
* You wouldn't believe the crap
I've had to deal with this week *

51:21.179 --> 51:23.681
* And I'm shoveling
most of it for free *

51:25.583 --> 51:29.720
* Grace under pressure
That's what the old man said *

51:29.787 --> 51:33.958
* Well, the old man said
a lot of things in his time *

51:34.024 --> 51:36.060
* Well, fighting a bull's
one thing * Fuck. My car.

51:36.127 --> 51:38.596
* Fighting bullshit's another *

51:38.663 --> 51:41.532
* You know, around here the
bullshit just never seems to die *

51:41.599 --> 51:44.235
* I just want nothing on my mind *

51:44.302 --> 51:46.404
* Nothing on my mind *

51:46.471 --> 51:48.773
* Nothing on my mind *

51:48.839 --> 51:50.775
* Nothing on my mind *

51:50.841 --> 51:53.043
* Nothing on my mind *

51:53.110 --> 51:55.146
* Nothing on my mind *

51:55.213 --> 51:57.315
* Nothing on my mind *

51:57.382 --> 51:59.717
* Nothing on my mind **

52:19.237 --> 52:22.173
**

52:22.240 --> 52:24.141
One, two, three, four!

52:24.209 --> 52:26.143
Fuck it.

52:29.347 --> 52:32.783
I can't believe he's actually getting
worse. I didn't think it was possible.

52:32.850 --> 52:35.586
- You guys talking about me?
- Yeah.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.855
You really do suck, mate.
Yeah, all right.

52:37.922 --> 52:40.925
Come on, let's take it from the
top, the music part. Okay, Sean.

52:40.991 --> 52:42.760
**

52:51.168 --> 52:53.238
**

52:53.304 --> 52:55.306
All right, it's too loud.
I can't hear the taps.

52:55.373 --> 52:57.842
- Turn it down.
- Don't go no lower than that.

52:57.908 --> 53:00.044
How many times are we gonna
have to fuckin' tell you?

53:00.110 --> 53:02.313
- Just turn it down.
- Hey, Mitch!

53:02.380 --> 53:04.649
How are ya, eh? Doin' good?

53:04.715 --> 53:06.684
Nice to see you shaved off
the bum fluff, Derrick.

53:06.751 --> 53:08.085
Boys.

53:08.152 --> 53:10.120
Hey, Sean.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.390
Oh, no. What happened to you now?
Don't worry about it.

53:12.457 --> 53:14.368
I like your new tap style,
but your band is bloody loud.

53:14.392 --> 53:16.603
You're gonna have to do something
about that. Yep. Tell me about it.

53:16.627 --> 53:18.587
This guy is a kook.
Get him a root, he'll improve.

53:18.629 --> 53:21.131
- That's beyond my powers.
- I've had a root.

53:21.198 --> 53:25.169
What are you doing here? You gonna come
and join us for a bit of a tap dance?

53:25.236 --> 53:27.414
What's the point of all this shit?
Come on. Let's go have a beer.

53:27.438 --> 53:31.175
What's wrong with it? We're doing
something. Better than the steelworks.

53:31.242 --> 53:33.878
Plus, I need some bloody inspiration.
These guys are shit.

53:33.944 --> 53:35.480
Yeah, yeah. No, only joking.

53:35.546 --> 53:37.715
Put some boots on.
Give me something.

53:37.782 --> 53:39.950
No, he's right.
You are shit. Let's go.

53:40.017 --> 53:42.553
Ah, Mitchie! Shut up.

53:44.154 --> 53:47.024
I just can't believe
he's doing it.

53:47.091 --> 53:48.859
I feel like we're mates again.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.730
That's great.

53:55.400 --> 54:00.271
Sean. What is it?

54:00.338 --> 54:03.508
Come on. I don't have time
for this, huh?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.543
I need to know. I'll shoot you.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.745
You're gonna shoot me?
Yeah, I'll shoot you.

54:07.812 --> 54:10.415
I think I'm gonna shoot you.
I think I'm gonna shoot you.

54:10.481 --> 54:12.717
Huh? Don't. Don't.

54:17.154 --> 54:21.926
Are you all right? Yeah. I'm
just not feeling very well.

54:21.992 --> 54:26.263
Oh, do you want me to get you something?
No, I'm fine.

54:30.401 --> 54:32.970
This looks good.

54:42.313 --> 54:44.582
Got a Stiffin's man.
All right, smart-ass.

54:44.649 --> 54:47.051
Hey, guys. I'd like you
to meet my friend Holly.

54:47.117 --> 54:50.455
She's a cadet journo at the Herald.
Said she'd do a story on us.

54:51.656 --> 54:53.758
It's a pleasure. Idiot.

54:53.824 --> 54:57.462
So, what's the name
of this tap troupe?

54:59.129 --> 55:00.998
Bootmen. It is?

55:01.065 --> 55:02.767
Yeah.

55:04.335 --> 55:06.604
Hey, so, Holly, is it, um...

55:06.671 --> 55:08.606
3,700?

55:08.673 --> 55:11.008
Hey! I thought you'd given
us a discount on this stuff.

55:11.075 --> 55:14.111
I did. Well, I don't have
that sort of money with me.

55:14.178 --> 55:16.747
Well, at 6:55 on the night,

55:16.814 --> 55:21.051
I want $3,700 in cash,
or I pack up all this equipment.

55:21.118 --> 55:24.789
Understood? Understood?

55:24.855 --> 55:27.124
Yeah. I'll see you at rehearsals.

55:27.191 --> 55:29.159
What for?

55:29.226 --> 55:32.072
Well, this does include you running the
lights and sound desk, doesn't it?

55:32.096 --> 55:34.064
No. That's an extra $200.

55:34.131 --> 55:36.166
"Doesn't it"? What?
Hey, that's a rip-off.

55:36.233 --> 55:39.737
Yeah, it is. It is.

55:39.804 --> 55:43.408
But as they say,
like it or lump it.

55:45.610 --> 55:48.946
3,900? Yeah.

55:49.013 --> 55:51.916
Even at 10 bucks a head,
we still need 400 people...

55:51.982 --> 55:54.519
to turn up on the night
just to cover that.

55:54.585 --> 55:56.821
It ain't gonna happen.

55:58.689 --> 56:01.191
We're gonna need more
than a newspaper story.

56:01.258 --> 56:05.129
Haven't you ever wondered
why nobody gets a ride home with you?

56:05.195 --> 56:08.041
Because nobody wants to be trapped in
a car with you. Shut up, all right?

56:08.065 --> 56:09.634
Go, go, go!

56:17.808 --> 56:22.379
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Excuse me, sweet.

56:25.950 --> 56:29.987
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Hey, look at these bloody idiots.

56:35.993 --> 56:38.863
Shit. It's the boys.

56:40.965 --> 56:43.133
Now, this is wide exposure. Yeah.

56:48.272 --> 56:50.875
You forget your pom-poms, lady?

56:52.242 --> 56:54.278
Come on.

56:54.344 --> 56:56.280
Hey, we should look
on the bright side.

56:56.346 --> 56:59.183
Even if we did get it back to front,
at least it was wide exposure.

56:59.249 --> 57:02.887
Yeah, except now everyone in town
thinks we're complete dickheads.

57:11.729 --> 57:16.133
Every time you fuck it up,
it's gonna cost you two bucks.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.536
Colin.

57:18.603 --> 57:20.471
I just saw you on television.
Yeah?

57:20.538 --> 57:22.406
Yes! Getting arrested.

57:22.473 --> 57:23.908
You looked like a bunch of morons.

57:23.974 --> 57:26.511
Why do you always have
to be so negative?

57:26.577 --> 57:30.715
Nothing's ever good enough. You're either
whinging about something or bossing me around.

57:30.781 --> 57:32.983
Why can't you just
be nice for a change?

57:33.050 --> 57:36.587
I saw that, Johnno. I do not have
to stand here and get insulted.

57:36.654 --> 57:40.691
- Well, then go.
- All right.

57:40.758 --> 57:45.462
Well, go on. All right, I will.

57:46.564 --> 57:48.966
Well, you're still here.

57:56.641 --> 57:58.943
You did the right thing, mate.

57:59.009 --> 58:01.345
What do you know?
You've never even had a root.

58:01.411 --> 58:04.815
What's a root?

58:04.882 --> 58:07.317
Come on, Dad. I wasn't charged.

58:07.384 --> 58:09.654
Only because I know Bluey Roberts.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.623
You made a goose out of yourself, you
made a goose out of your brother,

58:12.690 --> 58:14.625
and you made an even bigger
goose out of me.

58:14.692 --> 58:17.161
I hope you're proud of yourself.

58:17.227 --> 58:19.029
**

58:19.096 --> 58:21.599
Want to join our
dancing troupe, Gaz?

58:21.666 --> 58:23.333
Certainly got the legs for it.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.102
You want a punch
in the face, Clem?

58:40.685 --> 58:43.387
Huston. Uh, no, no, no!

58:43.453 --> 58:45.222
Huston. Get out of the way.

58:47.658 --> 58:51.228
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

59:01.572 --> 59:04.074
Don't fuck with me again,
pin dick!

59:07.144 --> 59:09.046
Jess.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.022
Huston.

59:34.371 --> 59:36.707
- Hey!
- Hi.

59:36.774 --> 59:39.409
We're going to rehearsals.
Come and watch. No. I...

59:39.476 --> 59:41.411
Can you just hold on for a minute?

59:41.478 --> 59:44.314
Because I need
to talk to you both.

59:47.752 --> 59:50.087
You okay?

59:50.154 --> 59:53.090
What's wrong?

59:53.157 --> 59:56.193
- I'm pregnant.
- You're joking.

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:05.135
It's his.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.813
Sean. Sean!

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:24.855
**

01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:33.439
All right. I give you the nod,
you know what to do, right?

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.465
You betcha. All right.

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:37.367
Hey, Sean.
We'll get going in a sec.

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:38.736
Good. Great.

01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:41.338
Here he is. You're late.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:45.275
- Fuckin' told ya.
- What the fuck happened to you?

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:48.979
I ran into some blokes who don't
appreciate tap dancers. I'm quittin'.

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:51.792
You can't do a runner now. I told you
before we started I didn't want this shit.

01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:53.851
We need you. Don't we?

01:00:53.918 --> 01:00:57.187
- See you later.
- Come on. It's just a black eye.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:01:01.558
Huh? Get over here, you dickhead.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:05.896
Hey, hey, guys, hey, I just have one
question at this particular juncture.

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.932
Shut up, you ferret.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.100
Hey, don't start on me, all right?

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.940
We gonna rehearse
this thing or what?

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:55.472
Yes!

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:17.227
**

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.429
What the fuck do you... Shut up!

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.501
Drumroll, please.

01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:29.482
Why didn't you tell me about rehearsals?
You know how I hate to be late.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:32.843
- What now?
- Well, now that's not nice to say to me, is it?

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:36.546
I even brought my own tap shoe.

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:39.016
- Pretty fuckin' good, eh?
- I hope you brought your leotard.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:46.323
- Fuck it!
- I'm calling the cops!

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.338
See ya.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.254
Mitchell!

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:54.491
No!

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.971
Hey.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:10.607
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mitch.

01:05:10.674 --> 01:05:13.310
Man, you're all right. You're all right.
You're all right.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.679
You'll be all right, mate, yeah?
Give us a kiss.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:21.718
Oh, Jesus. Mitch.

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:25.355
Mitchie. Mitchie.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.546
Better come down, son.

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:05.062
**

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:20.104
I can't see you anymore.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.874
It's Mitch.

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:27.111
I think about him
all the bloody time.

01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:34.118
I'm sorry.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.667
He's so little.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:01.845
G'day, Mr. Okden.
Should be a good game today.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.747
Should be, Col. You all right?

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.849
Yeah, sure.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.084
Look, I know this ain't
a great time to bring it up,

01:08:08.152 --> 01:08:12.689
but are we gonna do
this thing or what? No.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:16.693
Come on, mate. You got us started.
I can't do it, mate.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.895
Mitch would've wanted it.

01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:22.532
Don't fuckin' tell me
what Mitch would've wanted.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.902
I don't feel like going
to the football today.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:29.639
You go with Col, and I'll go home.

01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:31.475
I'll come with you.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:34.911
All right. See you later, Col.

01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:37.546
See you, Mr. Okden. See you, mate.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.251
Righto! Can I
have your attention, please?

01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:44.921
I've called this meeting because I've
received a bit of bad news from management.

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:47.191
Due to the
company's new direction,

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.759
operations at these steelworks...

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:52.127
will be scaled back immediately...

01:08:52.196 --> 01:08:54.363
before a full closure
in three months.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:57.367
Three months? Righto, listen up.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:09:00.837
All employees will be
entitled to severance pay...

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.971
commensurate with
the length of employment.

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.841
That's it.

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:30.427
Hear us over that
bloody band now, eh?

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:35.765
Hey, tiger. What if the Bootmen could
put on a benefit for these guys?

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:39.569
Bootmen? I thought you
gave that idea the flick.

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:41.371
These guys are gonna need money.

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:43.873
If we could get 5,000 people
to turn up for a show...

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.077
Five thousand?
Just go with it for a sec.

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.647
If we charge them 10 bucks
each, we'd have 50 grand.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:53.583
Yeah, but there's
4,000 steelworkers.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:56.152
You'd end up giving them, what?

01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:58.964
About 12 bucks each. That's not including
the cost of putting on the show.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.924
These guys don't need a handout.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:04.260
What they need is retraining, learning
about computers, that sort of stuff.

01:11:04.328 --> 01:11:08.398
If we take the 50 grand, subtract
10 for the cost of the show,

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:10.500
we'd still have 40 grand
to buy the computers.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.869
Hey, now that's not
such a bad idea.

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:18.041
Whoa! Quite the bouncer,
aren't we?

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.043
You better believe it, bub.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.847
What's this benefit thing about? How the
hell's that gonna work? Mates!

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:25.882
Whack these on your boots.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:30.520
Why? You want to be heard over
that cousin of yours, Newt?

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:32.456
What have you got in mind? Hey!

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:36.259
What have I told you blokes about
playing bloody cricket in the studio?

01:11:36.326 --> 01:11:39.062
Mate, can you call around to all
the other tap schools? What for?

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.731
We need something to make
this benefit really big.

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.430
Big enough for you, tiger?

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:16.933
What's this?

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:26.576
Dad, it's the only way
I know how to help.

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:29.746
We can... We can raise
some money, right?

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:33.049
And, I don't know,
start a retraining center.

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:40.189
And, I don't know, it would...
Mightn't make Mitch's death...

01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:42.426
feel so pointless.

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.431
I really want you
to come too, Dad.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:53.369
Just once. Please.

01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:09.586
Everything's still set up.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:11.921
Not here. Then where?

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:13.857
Not here.

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:45.589
A benefit in the actual steelworks,
in one of the workshops there.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:47.757
Gotta get some money together
for retraining.

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:51.761
We're hoping to get quite
a bit of money. Good kid.

01:13:55.732 --> 01:13:57.767
Just a reminder,

01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:00.704
the benefit concert for the
steelworks is this weekend.

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:04.641
Hey. Hey.

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:07.777
So you like tap dancing?
I might see you there.

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.585
I'm in.

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:17.153
- Move!
- Get off the road!

01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:44.681
Look, I just have to say that...

01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:48.685
when you have the baby,

01:14:48.752 --> 01:14:52.088
uh, I want to... I want to
take care of you both.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.860
I... I can handle it. You know,
I've really thought it through.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:00.296
I've got enough money, and I
don't expect anything from you.

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:04.601
I really want to help.
I really do.

01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:07.036
Thanks. Yeah.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:17.747
It doesn't seem real.

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:24.888
Shh.

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:42.305
Jesus, not again.
Excuse me, fellas.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.240
For what, being a faggot?

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:49.012
Hey, boys, if you want to punch
a poofter, well, here I am.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:51.314
Bit different
now it's two on two, huh?

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:55.785
Damn!

01:15:57.921 --> 01:16:01.024
Hey, don't worry, man.
You're not my type.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:05.361
Ten bucks! Ten dollars, folks!

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:07.196
Thanks. Ten bucks. Thank you.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:16.215
Hey, the traffic's backed all the
way up to the railway tracks.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.150
You won't start till
tomorrow night, at this rate.

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:20.777
Oh, yeah. We'll clear
40 grand at least, eh?

01:16:20.844 --> 01:16:25.481
You all right? Yeah. Fine.

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:27.684
Now, what is it?

01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:32.521
Well, the whole bloody
town's here except Dad.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.490
I thought he'd come.

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:36.592
Yeah.

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:42.565
Hey, it's a great job you're doing.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:45.268
Break a leg, all right?

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:50.339
Well, tiger, aren't you gonna say,
"Keep it simple and no improvising"?

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:55.078
No. It's your show. You can do
what the fuck you like.

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:58.915
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Ten bucks!

01:16:58.982 --> 01:17:03.552
- Ten dollars, folks.
- Sorry, mate. Excuse...

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.355
What are you doing here? I
thought you might need a hand.

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:08.391
Ten dollars, folks. Cool.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:12.061
Eh? Eh? Go get ready.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.430
Yeah.

01:17:14.497 --> 01:17:16.299
Come on, folks.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.535
- Ready for sound.
- I love these things.

01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:21.905
Thank Mitch.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:23.873
Thanks, Mitch.
Yeah, thanks, Mitch.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:30.747
All right, boys. You all right?

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:35.184
Just keep it simple. No improv...

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:38.087
I can't believe I just said that.
Let's just do it. We know it.

01:17:41.524 --> 01:17:44.393
Yeah!

01:17:57.841 --> 01:18:02.011
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:10.153
All right! Whoo!

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:19.763
Go, Col!

01:19:10.313 --> 01:19:13.817
Whoo! All right, boys! Oh, yeah!

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:57.861
Bring it on! Yeah!

01:21:21.978 --> 01:21:24.247

01:23:39.815 --> 01:23:42.485
Go, Col!

01:23:46.322 --> 01:23:49.658
Whoo-hoo! I love you, Col!

01:24:02.105 --> 01:24:04.039
Mum would have been
so proud of you.

01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:08.244
I'm proud of you.

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:20.523
They're still clapping.
You better go back out there.

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:57.373

01:28:01.844 --> 01:28:03.746
Yep.

01:28:48.391 --> 01:28:52.761
* Grace under pressure
That's what the old man said *

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:57.332
* Well, the old man said
a lot of things in his time *

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.435
* Well, fighting a bull's
one thing *

01:28:59.502 --> 01:29:01.370
* Fighting bullshit's another *

01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:04.573

a victim of conspiracy *

01:30:59.622 --> 01:31:01.590
* The young people Jesus *

01:31:01.657 --> 01:31:03.492

What's that?

01:32:35.984 --> 01:32:37.920
What's that?

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:40.122
