00:02.635 --> 00:04.034
<i>- Steve.
- Yeah?</i>

00:04.104 --> 00:08.700
Pick up that stick.
Slowly and carefully, now...

00:08.775 --> 00:11.243
agitate the hell out of this snake!

00:11.311 --> 00:12.573
Oh, hell no!

00:55.321 --> 00:57.152
"Who is the Drizzle"?

00:57.223 --> 00:59.521
Yeah, who is he? Wear the button.

00:59.592 --> 01:02.152
- He's you. You the Drizzle.
- I wish.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.662
But I am very good friends
with the Drizzle.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.029
He wanted you to have
these special Drizzle phones.

01:07.100 --> 01:10.365
They connect directly to the man himself
when you need his superhelp.

01:10.437 --> 01:11.631
He's giving us a cell phone?

01:11.704 --> 01:14.264
There's no text messaging.
This a suck phone.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.035
Yeah, but it's free...

01:16.276 --> 01:18.471
for the first month, and then after that...

01:18.545 --> 01:21.776
the Drizzle expects you
to walk on your own, you know.

01:21.848 --> 01:26.649
You're the ones in trouble, not him.
So, anyone in distress?

01:26.719 --> 01:30.621
Anything, you know, shaking?
You know, trouble?

01:30.690 --> 01:32.317
- Yes. How do I call Japan?
- No!

01:32.392 --> 01:33.654
I just got a deal on my phone.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.990
No international calls! The Drizzle's local.

01:36.062 --> 01:38.690
- I'm going back to my room, okay?
- Yes! To the room!

01:38.765 --> 01:41.325
Scan the Internet
and see if anyone's screaming for help.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.425
I'm calling Japan.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.470
Who the hell do you know there? Nobody!

01:44.537 --> 01:45.595
- Hello, Japan?
- No!

01:45.672 --> 01:48.641
- Yes, connect me to Godzilla, please.
- You don't get a phone.

01:48.708 --> 01:53.475
I told the Drizzle you'd mess this up.
It hasn't been five minutes and you did.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.014
Trouble! Hello?

01:56.082 --> 01:57.276
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

01:57.350 --> 01:59.113
What did you want me to do a search for?

01:59.185 --> 02:00.311
<i>Do...</i>

02:00.386 --> 02:04.152
Okay, give me a search
for "super crime," "girls in trouble"...

02:04.224 --> 02:06.158
and "press release, how to".

02:06.226 --> 02:07.693
Here's what your search turned up.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.388
"Sex with animals"? There's no time, man!

02:10.463 --> 02:12.829
You know, you're right.
I don't have time for this.

02:12.899 --> 02:15.697
But, you know, the Drizzle,
when he was...

02:16.336 --> 02:20.864
As a kid, he was bitten by a feisty worm
in a science lab accident.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.874
Radioactive stuff.

02:22.942 --> 02:25.240
I don't know how it happened,
but I swear to God...

02:25.311 --> 02:29.680
from that day on he was able
to manipulate the rain, and that is fresh.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.115
- Rain?
- Yeah. For justice.

02:32.285 --> 02:36.449
You know, when the villains
try to do stuff, he's like a rain out.

02:36.723 --> 02:39.248
Rain it out! Justice reigns supreme.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.088
Yeah. That's deep, Shake.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.063
Yeah. See, then they got to pick
another day to do the crime...

02:45.331 --> 02:48.823
and he's rained it out again!
He's always a step ahead.

02:48.902 --> 02:53.202
Finally, they can't schedule their deeds
of, you know, misdoing.

02:53.273 --> 02:58.040
- They just get tired.
- You know, that's really amazingly lame.

02:58.111 --> 03:01.137
Yeah. It sounded cooler last week.

03:01.614 --> 03:05.914
I heard he has laser feet.
That's cool, right? I ask you.

03:05.985 --> 03:09.352
You know, you would think that
if he got bit by a radioactive worm...

03:09.422 --> 03:13.381
he'd have some sort of burrowing powers
or something like that, right?

03:13.459 --> 03:16.758
Well, he could do that, too.
I mean, none of it's written in stone.

03:16.829 --> 03:19.662
I mean, he's bad. To the bone.

03:19.732 --> 03:21.063
- Yeah.
- His laser bone.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.396
Thanks for the Drizzle phone.

03:22.468 --> 03:26.199
I'll be sure to contact him if we need
to dig a hole in the yard or something.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.740
Okay. I'll be in the crawlspace
if you need him.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.070
- Look at this.
- What?

03:30.143 --> 03:32.839
- Maybe we should call the Drizzle.
- What is it? Is it easy?

03:32.912 --> 03:35.972
Apparently three drums
of highly toxic chemical waste...

03:36.049 --> 03:39.143
have been stolen
from their storage facility in the river.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.211
You know, that is so beneath the Drizzle.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.654
I mean, he doesn't solve
unscheduled robberies.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.716
What kind of a...
This stuff needs to be known in advance.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.126
- I know.
- So he can get the clouds going and stuff.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.357
- There's a lot of prep work involved.
- Sure.

03:52.432 --> 03:55.230
Plus, he had nothing to do with that.

03:55.301 --> 03:59.203
And I will deny it up and down
if you say I did. He did.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.406
Come on, wormies.
Let's go. Soup's on. Eat it up.

04:03.476 --> 04:06.445
Save some room for dessert,
which is gonna be me.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.675
What, do you got a broken arm?
Here, lap it up.

04:10.617 --> 04:14.713
Oh, damn it.
I guess there's nothing to do but just...

04:14.787 --> 04:17.880
Oh, no! An accident! How did this happen?

04:18.558 --> 04:23.052
Oh! I'm getting stronger.
I'm getting hotter, too.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.860
I mean, really hot.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.268
Hot! Hot!

04:32.672 --> 04:33.730
Drizzle here.

04:33.806 --> 04:36.673
<i>Yes, Drizzle, violent criminals...</i>

04:37.410 --> 04:39.640
<i>- What did you... Fat Albert?
- Prince Albert.</i>

04:39.712 --> 04:44.115
- Yeah, I put Fat Albert in a can.
- No, no. It's Prince. Prince Albert.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.048
Oh, okay. Hang on.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.418
I put Fat Albert in a can, in your can.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.616
I'll need precise coordinates, ma'am.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.420
Okay.

04:54.227 --> 04:59.130
<i>It's in your butt, boy.
Did you hear me? It's in your butt!</i>

04:59.799 --> 05:01.699
Pranksters! Sons of...

05:02.368 --> 05:03.665
- Drizzle here.
- Shake?

05:03.736 --> 05:06.671
<i>- No Shake. This is the Drizzle.
- Come on, Shake.</i>

05:06.739 --> 05:09.401
<i>Come on, what? This is the Drizzle.
What do you need?</i>

05:09.475 --> 05:12.467
All right, is Shake around?
You're friends with him, right?

05:12.545 --> 05:16.106
Check. 10-4. Shake, are you there?

05:16.182 --> 05:18.241
Yes, I'm right beside you.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.678
You have a call. Thank you.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.854
<i>Out. Hand the phone to me, please.</i>

05:24.223 --> 05:25.485
Yes. Here you go.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.651
<i>- Shake?
- Hello, this is Shake.</i>

05:27.727 --> 05:28.853
<i>- Shake.
- Hold on, please.</i>

05:28.928 --> 05:31.658
Thank you, Drizzle. This is Shake.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.460
<i>Whatever. The printer called and said...</i>

05:33.533 --> 05:36.297
<i>that the Drizzle stationery
and business cards are ready...</i>

05:36.369 --> 05:40.271
<i>but they're concerned with the paper
being black and the ink being black that...</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:44.140
Everything must be black,
like the storm of justice!

05:44.210 --> 05:46.075
<i>Well, maybe you better talk to them, then.</i>

05:46.145 --> 05:48.170
And this is blocking up the hallway.

05:48.247 --> 05:51.114
The Eye of Justice.
The Drizzle is lost without it.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.982
He needs to turn it off.
And, by the way, where is he?

05:54.053 --> 05:58.012
Because if he is flexible, I have a few ideas
that I think he might like.

05:58.091 --> 06:02.050
Yeah, here we go! Notes.
All right, within reason.

06:02.128 --> 06:05.063
But you gotta understand
I make the final call on this.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.257
Okay. Come on out.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.665
It might be a good idea. That doesn't mean
it's a "Drizzle" good idea.

06:09.736 --> 06:13.069
Howdy, villains. I'm Mr. Mister.
Watch your back, crime.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.165
- When I get pissed, you get mist.
- Forget it.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.073
See? He's the Drizzle's new sidekick.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.169
- Nice try, fellas.
- He's the Mist Master.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.976
No! That's not happening.
The Drizzle works alone.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.212
He doesn't share the credit
with ignoramuses.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.686
He's a renegade. Plus, he's not married.

06:29.756 --> 06:33.351
Couldn't Mr. Mister just hang out on
the adventures and help get things wet?

06:33.426 --> 06:36.361
The Drizzle is the wet one.
Get your own thing.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.693
You can't. Because you're insecure.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.700
I told you this was stupid.
I want to do lightning and thunder.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.736
- He don't do that.
- He doesn't need it.

06:43.803 --> 06:47.068
Rain is his thing, man.
Sheets and sheets of it.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.673
And it drenches criminals
when they're outside.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.372
So then they go inside
and rob banks and kill people.

06:55.381 --> 06:59.408
Oh, yeah? Is that what you think?
Taste the rain of vengeance.

06:59.819 --> 07:02.049
Rain Power, go!

07:03.723 --> 07:04.985
Come on!

07:06.459 --> 07:10.361
You can expect a forecast of vengeance
in the very near future.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.594
- Shake, are you on fire?
- What? No. This is... What is this?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.100
- Them is fumes.
- Fumes?

07:16.169 --> 07:19.297
That's what you ought to be, boy.
Call yourself "the Fume".

07:19.372 --> 07:23.809
Look, let me straighten you out.
I'm not doing that, okay? It's ridiculous.

07:23.876 --> 07:28.040
Print shop? I'm inquiring about
a very large project on the Fume.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.512
Check under "Drizzle".

07:31.984 --> 07:35.147
Yeah, there's been some changes.
See, I'm sorry to say...

07:35.221 --> 07:38.679
but that storm cloud's got to become
a fume now 'cause that's what I do.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.055
So do it.

07:40.827 --> 07:44.456
It's not my fault it's already done, sir.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.392
That's a different guy and he's dead now.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.028
No! I didn't sign off on that, okay?

07:51.103 --> 07:54.038
Hey, don't make me
send the Fume down there.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.234
Black on black, you got it.

07:58.177 --> 08:01.772
I am not asking you
if people will be able to write on it.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.817
I'm telling you I want black on black!

08:05.451 --> 08:08.511
What am I speaking?
Am I talking Greek to you?

08:08.588 --> 08:12.615
I want the "D" to an "F," and
I want a fume instead of a storm cloud.

08:12.692 --> 08:13.989
Is this hard?

08:15.061 --> 08:17.621
- No, I am not the Fume.
- You should call it "the Node".

08:17.697 --> 08:19.927
- I market him. I'm his friend.
- Or "the Fish Tail".

08:19.999 --> 08:21.728
He's not around because I'm here. Do it.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.133
Or "That Thing
That's Spurting All Over the Place".

08:24.203 --> 08:26.262
What are you...
I'm conducting business here.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.328
Is that part of you?

08:27.406 --> 08:30.375
Oh, God, what is it? It won't move!
There's no nerves in there.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.842
This just came for the Drizzle.
Where do you want it?

08:32.912 --> 08:35.312
- Who's the Drizzle?
- We don't know that, do we?

08:35.381 --> 08:38.908
- But he owes me $40 for the C.O.D.
- I don't know what to tell you.

08:38.985 --> 08:42.818
Last I heard, he was going to conduct
business in the middle of the sun.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.049
That could be bad.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.057
So I guess we can
send this box back, then.

08:46.125 --> 08:50.289
No. You know what? I have the key to his
Fortress of Precipitation. I'll drop it off.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.457
Let's look at it, though.
What the hell is this?

08:53.533 --> 08:56.058
The cloud was supposed to be
at least twice this size.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.797
- Yeah, and I thought he didn't do lightning.
- He doesn't!

08:58.871 --> 09:02.272
I told that moron half a dozen times
over the phone...

09:02.542 --> 09:05.534
What's this? Villains? This is too busy.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.808
This is all too busy!
By the time you read it, you're dead.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.076
Say, can I get that $40 now,
'cause, you know...

09:11.150 --> 09:14.813
- I'm not paying for this! No. Give me that.
- Where are you going?

09:14.887 --> 09:19.688
I'm going to let the Fume know that
he needs to let the world know he exists.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.692
<i>Downtown is in flames tonight,
as a mysterious arsonist...</i>

09:22.762 --> 09:24.161
Shake. You messed up this time.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.357
- Is that me? Am I on?
- Damn!

09:26.432 --> 09:29.060
What? What's the matter?
Never seen a TV star before?

09:29.135 --> 09:30.500
Have you seen yourself recently?

09:30.570 --> 09:34.097
Well, I'm trying to see myself on TV,
but you won't move.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.332
- Did you get taller?
- Yeah, I did. Yeah.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.968
<i>Our video enhancement technology...</i>

09:39.045 --> 09:42.981
<i>shows what appears to be
ants running from a charred catfish.</i>

09:43.049 --> 09:45.517
I told them that it wouldn't read.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.684
Yeah, that's all the clues...

09:49.755 --> 09:54.249
except for the life-size letters
spelling out "the Fume," you idiots!

09:54.327 --> 09:57.387
- You're dissolving like sugar in coffee.
- Meatwad!

09:57.463 --> 10:00.694
- All right, I have something to confess.
- You're the Fume?

10:00.766 --> 10:02.893
- How did you know?
- More like "the Puddle" now.

10:02.969 --> 10:06.666
Listen! We must keep
my secret identity a secret.

10:06.806 --> 10:10.105
And that's what sucks
about a secret identity.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.906
I will never get the credit that I deserve...

10:12.979 --> 10:15.914
for the attention-grabbing things that I do.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.107
- What is that?
- The floor, it's making sounds.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.143
Fume Power, go forth!

10:24.357 --> 10:26.416
You know, suffocate!

10:26.492 --> 10:28.357
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.959
- You got it. Okay, you get it...
- That's what I was gonna do.

10:32.031 --> 10:36.195
- What the hell were those?
- Man, you know, it has been a long day.

10:36.268 --> 10:39.101
- Is this toxic waste down here?
- I gotta tell you, I am wiped.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.900
Man, this whole house is contaminated.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.739
And would it kill us to get an AC unit
in here? I mean, I'm burning up.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.779
I'll check the thermostat.
Come on, Meatwad.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.815
- Very funny, fellas.
- Come on, Meatwad.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.645
Who put it way up on the wall?

10:51.717 --> 10:54.982
I think we're gonna live with Uncle Carl
for a few weeks.
