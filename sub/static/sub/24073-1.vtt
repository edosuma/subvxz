00:28.160 --> 00:29.293
Go fish.

00:29.295 --> 00:31.264
Really?
I thought I had you.

00:32.465 --> 00:34.598
Guys, thanks for inviting me
out camping.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.132
This has been great.

00:36.134 --> 00:38.135
Yeah, just don't tell my parents
we snuck out here.

00:38.137 --> 00:39.470
I would totally
get grounded.

00:39.472 --> 00:40.604
You got it.

00:40.606 --> 00:41.573
Any queens?

00:42.341 --> 00:45.141
Nope! Go fish!

00:47.813 --> 00:49.213
That was weird.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.281
Just got quiet all of a sudden.

00:54.552 --> 00:56.055
What was that?

00:57.256 --> 00:59.323
I don't know.
A bear maybe?

00:59.325 --> 01:02.062
A bear?
I haven't seen a bear before.

01:03.496 --> 01:04.561
Let's go check it out.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.863
Cool. Let's do this, bro!

01:06.865 --> 01:10.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa. you said
this wasn't a scary story.

01:10.269 --> 01:13.369
- Did I?
- This is a scary story?

01:13.371 --> 01:14.770
No...

01:14.772 --> 01:17.508
I don't know, the dialogue
seems pretty scary.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.179
Pshh! Shall I continue?

01:19.745 --> 01:22.148
"Let's do this, bro!"

01:22.748 --> 01:24.181
Where was I?

01:24.183 --> 01:25.916
Oh, yeah Donny
had never seen a bear,

01:25.918 --> 01:27.918
so he asked Bobby
to go see it with him.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.222
Elizabeth did not think
it was a good idea.

01:30.623 --> 01:33.359
Donny Phillips, I do not think
that is a good idea.

01:36.929 --> 01:40.696
Donny Phillips? As in our science
teacher, Mr. Donald Phillips?

01:40.698 --> 01:42.268
Yeah, But he was
way younger then.

01:42.801 --> 01:45.537
Donny Phillips, I do not think
that is a good idea.

01:46.638 --> 01:48.538
All right, now,
stop interrupting.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.176
I want to finish this story.
Where was I?

01:50.643 --> 01:52.609
<i>Donny said, "We'll be fine.</i>

01:52.611 --> 01:55.215
<i>Ain't nothing out there
that can scare us!"</i>

01:55.847 --> 01:57.450
Famous last words.

02:17.836 --> 02:19.139
Do you see anything yet?

02:19.771 --> 02:22.341
- No, you?
- Nah.

02:25.978 --> 02:28.515
Bobby? Donny?

02:32.818 --> 02:34.451
I don't see your lights.

02:34.453 --> 02:35.818
Where are you?

02:44.597 --> 02:46.996
And that is the legend
of Foggy River.

02:46.998 --> 02:48.931
- Lame.
- Whatever.

02:48.933 --> 02:50.870
Did the monster get them?

02:51.336 --> 02:53.472
What? No, they scared it away.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.440
But Mr. Phillips
swore it was real.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.909
After a while, the other two
said that it was fake.

02:58.911 --> 03:01.381
So Mr. Phillips became
a local joke.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.551
That's why he became
a science teacher.

03:04.949 --> 03:06.716
So the monster wasn't real?

03:06.718 --> 03:09.489
No. Well, I wouldn't say that.

03:10.322 --> 03:11.723
I still believe
he roams the woods.

03:12.957 --> 03:14.657
Like the ones behind your house!

03:18.796 --> 03:20.998
Great, now, he's gonna have
nightmares forever.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.333
What? You wanted me
to tell the story, so I did.

03:23.335 --> 03:24.900
You said it wasn't scary.

03:24.902 --> 03:27.036
Come on, it wasn't that scary.

03:29.608 --> 03:31.610
Everything okay in here?

03:32.010 --> 03:33.910
- Yes, Dad.
- We heard a scream.

03:33.912 --> 03:37.283
Yeah, that was just me telling
them the Legend of Foggy River.

03:38.016 --> 03:40.620
Foggy River? Are you
trying to scare my kids?

03:41.020 --> 03:43.919
- Not intentionally.
- I'm not scared.

03:43.921 --> 03:45.454
I know you're not,
my little man,

03:45.456 --> 03:47.323
but, I think maybe it's time
for bed, so, come on.

03:47.325 --> 03:48.725
Dylan should be going home.

03:48.727 --> 03:49.729
Yes, ma'am.

03:51.462 --> 03:53.233
See ya, buddy.

03:54.366 --> 03:56.236
Goodnight, Mr. and Mrs. Parker.

03:56.568 --> 03:58.368
- Good night, Dylan.
- Good night Alex.

03:58.370 --> 03:59.305
Good night, buddy.

04:42.413 --> 04:43.813
What? What?
What happened?

04:43.815 --> 04:45.682
The monster's in my room.

04:45.684 --> 04:48.985
- What monster?
- The monster from Dylan's story.

04:48.987 --> 04:51.887
You're seeing
monsters again?

04:51.889 --> 04:54.390
It was just a stupid story,
it's not real.

04:54.392 --> 04:56.560
Can I sleep with you tonight?

04:56.562 --> 04:59.062
Fine.
Just for tonight.

04:59.064 --> 05:01.434
But... but don't keep me up,
all right?

05:01.766 --> 05:04.069
I promise.
Good night.

05:09.007 --> 05:10.574
Can I sleep with you?

05:10.576 --> 05:13.513
Sure.

05:28.694 --> 05:30.093
What?

05:30.095 --> 05:32.461
Alex,
what are you doing?

05:32.463 --> 05:33.897
You're gonna be
late for school.

05:33.899 --> 05:35.567
Huh? What time is it?

05:36.134 --> 05:37.569
It's 7:34.

05:38.870 --> 05:39.871
Oh, no!

06:02.593 --> 06:06.632
Based on the sound
of the footsteps,

06:06.932 --> 06:09.035
I can only hypothesize

06:09.535 --> 06:12.601
that Mr. Parker has decided

06:12.603 --> 06:15.375
to grace us
with his presence today.

06:17.209 --> 06:19.545
Mr. Parker,
so nice of you to join us.

06:19.911 --> 06:21.447
Hey, Mr. Phillips.
Good morning.

06:22.213 --> 06:23.747
Look, I can explain, okay?

06:23.749 --> 06:25.051
Shh, shh, shh! Shh!

06:26.084 --> 06:29.219
Unless, your explanation
includes a section in which

06:29.221 --> 06:31.624
I win an all-expense-paid
getaway to Tahiti,

06:32.057 --> 06:33.522
I don't want to hear it.

06:33.524 --> 06:34.894
- But sir, I mean...
- Shh!

06:35.627 --> 06:38.997
Does your explanation
include me winning a vacation?

06:40.132 --> 06:42.435
- No, sir.
- Have a seat.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.437
Yes, sir.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.572
Oh, Mr. Parker.

06:47.773 --> 06:49.842
While you're up and about,
why don't you take these tests

06:50.576 --> 06:51.942
and pass them out
to your classmates.

06:55.713 --> 06:59.618
Ladies and gentlemen,
you have until the bell rings.

07:17.002 --> 07:20.506
You may begin... now.

07:56.574 --> 07:57.543
Hey!

07:59.778 --> 08:01.747
Oh, um...

08:02.747 --> 08:04.680
- Hey, Ashley.
- Are you okay?

08:04.682 --> 08:05.784
You look really tired.

08:06.317 --> 08:07.851
Me?

08:07.853 --> 08:10.687
Um, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

08:10.689 --> 08:12.221
Did you study for this test?

08:12.223 --> 08:15.257
Uhh, I tried.

08:15.259 --> 08:16.262
I know what'll help.

08:16.795 --> 08:18.965
Here, have some ice cream.

08:20.098 --> 08:23.235
Okay, uh, where'd you
get this from?

08:24.168 --> 08:25.670
Mr. Phillips is serving it.

08:27.639 --> 08:29.542
Who wants pistachio?

08:30.041 --> 08:31.276
Micah.

08:32.177 --> 08:33.642
That's weird.

08:33.644 --> 08:36.212
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

08:36.214 --> 08:38.017
Why haven't you ever
asked me to hang out?

08:40.118 --> 08:41.187
Uh...

08:41.986 --> 08:43.686
Well...

08:43.688 --> 08:45.354
'Cause, I thought
you wouldn't...

08:45.356 --> 08:46.558
Say yes?

08:47.793 --> 08:48.927
Maybe you should try.

08:50.128 --> 08:50.997
All right.

08:53.197 --> 08:55.967
Ashley, would you
like to hang out...

08:56.999 --> 08:57.166
More ice cream?

08:57.168 --> 09:00.970
Uh... sure.

09:00.972 --> 09:02.839
Ahhh. Time's up.

09:04.976 --> 09:06.876
I said time's up.

09:06.878 --> 09:09.048
Please bring your completed
papers to the front.

09:18.056 --> 09:19.625
Hey, hey, um, Ashley...

09:20.158 --> 09:21.056
Hey, what's up?

09:21.058 --> 09:22.260
Um...

09:23.861 --> 09:25.261
Um, I was wondering...

09:25.263 --> 09:26.132
Hang on.

09:28.133 --> 09:31.634
Looks like someone just
posted a picture of you sleeping.

09:31.636 --> 09:33.672
What? Who?

09:34.806 --> 09:35.675
Gordon Peters.

09:39.644 --> 09:42.244
- Gordon Peters.
- Cute pic, though.

09:42.246 --> 09:43.847
Eight-one likes already.

09:43.849 --> 09:46.248
You're trending.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.285
Did you need something?

09:48.754 --> 09:51.387
Me? No, no.
Sorry, sorry.

09:51.389 --> 09:53.292
Okay. I'll see you later.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.263
Thank you.

09:58.163 --> 09:59.365
Ashley.

10:04.135 --> 10:05.704
Having a problem,
Mr. Parker?

10:06.370 --> 10:07.706
No, no.

10:09.674 --> 10:11.974
Well, yes.

10:11.976 --> 10:14.911
I seemed to have fallen asleep
instead of taking my science test.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.713
Yes, I know.

10:16.715 --> 10:18.117
- You do?
- Yes.

10:18.750 --> 10:19.817
You seemed so peaceful.

10:20.384 --> 10:22.752
I didn't want to bother
a student that thought sleeping

10:22.754 --> 10:25.191
was more important than
taking a big science test.

10:25.956 --> 10:27.393
Is there any way I can
make it up during my lunch?

10:34.265 --> 10:35.898
Yes.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.237
I'll be here grading papers.
Don't be late.

10:40.004 --> 10:41.774
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I'll see you at lunch.

10:42.039 --> 10:44.075
Yes, I'm on the edge of my chair
with anticipation.

10:44.775 --> 10:45.910
And, Mr. Parker...

10:46.812 --> 10:49.215
If you do really
good on the test,

10:49.947 --> 10:51.283
maybe I'll give you
some ice cream.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.752
Did I talk in my sleep?

10:54.985 --> 10:55.987
Oh, yeah.

10:58.756 --> 11:02.025
All I have to do is just get
through today without falling asleep.

11:40.932 --> 11:42.297
What are you doing?

11:42.299 --> 11:45.300
- Dude, don't do that.
- I couldn't help it.

11:45.302 --> 11:47.002
You were staring
at Ashley so much,

11:47.004 --> 11:48.838
it was borderline creepy.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.806
I wasn't staring at Ashley.

11:50.808 --> 11:53.144
You were totally staring.
It was embarrassing.

11:54.245 --> 11:55.180
Hey, ladies.

11:57.381 --> 11:59.384
I was just... zoning out.

12:00.217 --> 12:02.017
Whatever.

12:02.019 --> 12:03.552
Hey, I found some old movies
I was gonna watch.

12:03.554 --> 12:06.555
- What're you doing later?
- Don't you have detention, again?

12:06.557 --> 12:08.027
Yeah, so, we'll do it after.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.926
We'll see.
I'm kind of tired.

12:10.928 --> 12:12.298
Hey, how'd you do
on that science test?

12:14.065 --> 12:15.234
Oh, no, I gotta go!

12:20.238 --> 12:21.440
Napkin?

12:22.807 --> 12:23.775
Thank you.

12:28.813 --> 12:30.515
Sorry, Mr. Phillips.

12:31.582 --> 12:33.852
Sorry?
Sorry about what?

12:34.385 --> 12:35.450
Being late.

12:35.452 --> 12:37.554
No, no, no.
No need to apologize.

12:37.556 --> 12:41.123
No need to apologize
about being late, yet again.

12:41.125 --> 12:45.127
No, no, no. Actually,
you did me a big favor.

12:45.129 --> 12:47.129
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

12:47.131 --> 12:49.100
In that you did not
take the test,

12:49.600 --> 12:51.166
I don't have to grade it.

12:51.168 --> 12:54.903
All I have to do
is put a big, old, fat zero

12:54.905 --> 12:58.176
right on there because that's the
amount of work you did on it, right?

12:58.576 --> 13:00.475
But, Mr. Phillips...

13:00.477 --> 13:01.846
Butts are for sitting.

13:02.447 --> 13:04.316
Mr. Phillips, I'm begging you.

13:05.182 --> 13:06.552
I would really like
to take this test.

13:11.222 --> 13:12.223
I know you would.

13:13.390 --> 13:15.557
But unfortunately, now I have
somewhere I have to be,

13:15.559 --> 13:18.196
and unlike you,
I don't like to be late.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.901
We'll talk about your grade later.
Have a nice day.

13:24.235 --> 13:26.134
Oh, and by the way, Mr. Parker,

13:26.136 --> 13:28.103
Wherever you happen
to be going, I'd hurry up,

13:28.105 --> 13:29.571
otherwise you will
be late again.

13:37.514 --> 13:39.918
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

13:40.118 --> 13:42.021
- Gordon Peters.
- That's me.

13:42.254 --> 13:43.923
Did I just catch you
running in the halls?

13:44.154 --> 13:46.989
- I wasn't running...
- Looked like running to me.

13:46.991 --> 13:48.958
And there's a no running policy
here at Murphy High.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.325
But, I wasn't running.

13:50.327 --> 13:51.831
Looks like I'm gonna
have to give you a demerit slip.

13:52.062 --> 13:53.432
You're kidding, right?

13:54.966 --> 13:56.435
Do I look like a comedian?

13:57.802 --> 14:00.536
No. Just like someone who likes to
give me a hard time for no reason.

14:00.538 --> 14:02.104
Are you talking back?

14:02.106 --> 14:04.540
Disrespecting
the head hall monitor.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.310
Running in the halls.
Late to class.

14:07.312 --> 14:08.945
Looks like you're gonna
have fun in detention.

14:08.947 --> 14:10.979
What? Can you even do that?

14:10.981 --> 14:13.616
Yup, I'm the head hall monitor.
I can do anything I want.

14:13.618 --> 14:15.554
Like posting pictures
of me sleeping.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.057
Maybe you shouldn't
sleep in class.

14:20.225 --> 14:21.927
Have fun,
Speedy McSpeederson.

14:22.594 --> 14:23.596
Thanks.

14:24.596 --> 14:26.264
Detention?

14:26.998 --> 14:28.000
Aw, man.

14:35.539 --> 14:36.641
Why am I not surprised?

14:37.509 --> 14:38.576
Hello, Mr. Phillips.

14:39.244 --> 14:39.912
Have a seat.

14:42.379 --> 14:44.884
Oh. So you've come
to keep me company?

14:46.051 --> 14:46.919
No.

14:52.524 --> 14:55.660
What is she doing here?
She's like the perfect student.

14:56.394 --> 14:57.929
How could she get in trouble?

14:58.495 --> 14:59.298
I don't know.

14:59.663 --> 15:00.932
Hey, you!

15:02.634 --> 15:04.499
Are you supposed to be in here?

15:06.203 --> 15:07.673
Hey, bookworm.

15:08.639 --> 15:10.909
Why do you have detention?

15:14.245 --> 15:15.480
She's a quiet one, huh?

15:16.413 --> 15:18.281
That is correct, Mr. Renner.

15:18.283 --> 15:20.286
Perhaps you should
follow her example.

15:20.518 --> 15:22.955
Sorry, Mr. Phillips.
Won't happen again.

15:25.322 --> 15:27.290
Hello, Mr. Phillips.

15:27.292 --> 15:29.758
Oh! Oh, thank goodness
you're here, Gordon.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.095
Thank goodness you're here. Uh,
students, Gordon will be watching you

15:33.097 --> 15:34.730
for the rest
of your detention period.

15:34.732 --> 15:37.402
I have an appointment,
which I must keep.

15:37.668 --> 15:40.305
I'm sure you will show him
the same respect you show me.

15:41.072 --> 15:43.238
Of course we will, Mr. Phillips.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.276
- -Don't even
think about trying anything.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.549
What're you doing?

15:52.283 --> 15:53.284
Trust me.

15:56.754 --> 15:58.023
What are you doing?

15:58.590 --> 16:00.690
- Are you eating?
- Yeah. You want some?

16:00.692 --> 16:02.425
Don't mind if I do.

16:02.427 --> 16:04.163
- Come on!
- What?

16:11.568 --> 16:12.570
Watch this.

16:24.048 --> 16:24.750
You Okay there?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.055
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

16:32.823 --> 16:35.624
- That was epic!
- What was that?

16:35.626 --> 16:37.459
I gave him a bag
of sugar-free Gummi Bears.

16:37.461 --> 16:39.061
Why?

16:39.063 --> 16:40.565
'Cause everybody loves
Gummi Bears.

16:41.298 --> 16:44.834
And because I read on the online
reviews it causes crazy gas.

16:44.836 --> 16:47.139
So, you're planning on
being here tomorrow, too.

16:47.572 --> 16:48.740
What're you in here for?

16:49.774 --> 16:50.839
Gordon gave me detention.

16:50.841 --> 16:52.407
What? Why?

16:52.409 --> 16:53.843
'Cause, he doesn't like me.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.578
He doesn't like anyone.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.347
He also posted a picture of me
sleeping in class today.

16:58.349 --> 17:00.215
What are you doing
sleeping in class?

17:00.217 --> 17:03.151
Uh, my little brother
kept me up all week.

17:03.153 --> 17:06.189
- Why?
- Because he thinks there's a monster in his room

17:06.191 --> 17:08.356
- 'cause of your stupid story.
- That's awesome!

17:08.358 --> 17:10.361
No, it's not awesome!

17:10.662 --> 17:13.164
He thinks there's a monster
running around the house.

17:13.765 --> 17:17.132
Odds are he's just hearing
the air conditioner going on.

17:17.134 --> 17:18.534
Or a squeaky door.

17:18.536 --> 17:20.469
Or a branch hitting
the window, perhaps.

17:20.471 --> 17:21.671
Who asked you?

17:21.673 --> 17:24.308
No one, but it's
all very logical.

17:25.210 --> 17:29.347
Younger kids let their imagination run
their thoughts instead of being rational,

17:29.681 --> 17:32.614
allowing them to believe
that something quite normal

17:32.616 --> 17:36.055
is really a large beast with razor
sharp teeth wanting to eat them.

17:36.688 --> 17:38.488
I thought you said
she was the quiet one.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.324
Maybe if you showed him
that his "monster"

17:41.326 --> 17:43.526
was just random noises
in the wall,

17:43.528 --> 17:44.829
he wouldn't
be scared anymore.

17:45.529 --> 17:47.130
Doubt it.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.435
Like you said, he's got
quite an imagination.

17:49.901 --> 17:53.806
Then use his imagination to show
him that the monster isn't real.

17:54.404 --> 17:57.840
Do you mean like pretend to
be imaginary monster fighters

17:57.842 --> 17:59.741
to fight his monster?

17:59.743 --> 18:03.345
Dude, that's the most
amazing idea I've ever heard.

18:03.347 --> 18:06.849
- It is?
- Yeah, we put together a bunch of costumes and gadgets

18:06.851 --> 18:09.151
to make it look like
we fight his monster,

18:09.153 --> 18:11.821
but really we're taking care of
all the noisy stuff in his room

18:11.823 --> 18:14.390
so he'll never think
that there's a monster again!

18:14.392 --> 18:15.326
What do ya think?

18:16.327 --> 18:18.728
Well, that sounds
crazy enough to work.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.165
What about you, uhhh...

18:24.301 --> 18:26.201
uhh...

18:26.203 --> 18:28.403
- Phoenix.
- That's right.

18:28.405 --> 18:30.472
We're in classes together.

18:30.474 --> 18:31.940
I know, I just
forgot for a moment.

18:31.942 --> 18:33.808
You cheat off my tests.

18:33.810 --> 18:36.511
Well, I don't look at your name
when I look at your paper.

18:36.513 --> 18:37.715
I already know my name.

18:38.549 --> 18:40.451
So, Phoenix, do you
like my idea or not?

18:42.554 --> 18:44.886
Actually, I think you guys
are onto something.

18:44.888 --> 18:46.555
- Really?
- Of course we are.

18:46.557 --> 18:50.192
- Can I help?
- You? What can you do?

18:50.194 --> 18:54.229
I can help you to scientifically decipher
what the real cause of his delusions are.

18:54.231 --> 18:55.331
Huh?

18:55.333 --> 18:56.899
And, I can build your gadgets.

18:56.901 --> 18:59.267
- You make gadgets?
- Yeah.

18:59.269 --> 19:01.770
- Like what?
- Like this.

19:01.772 --> 19:03.238
What is that?

19:03.240 --> 19:05.274
The thing that got me in here.

19:05.276 --> 19:08.276
Technically, It's a battery source
that I made for science class,

19:08.278 --> 19:09.946
but it acts more like a Taser.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.780
And accidently
Tased Mr. Beaumont.

19:11.782 --> 19:14.285
- No way!
- Uhhhh.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.788
- No, don't touch it!
- What does this do?

19:21.593 --> 19:23.325
I told him.

19:23.327 --> 19:24.893
Someone's coming.
Help me get him up.

19:33.971 --> 19:35.270
What's his problem?

19:36.974 --> 19:38.276
Too many Gummi Bears?

19:43.381 --> 19:44.747
What happened?

19:44.749 --> 19:46.617
You touched my Taser
when I told you not to.

19:47.251 --> 19:48.486
So are we doing the thing?

19:48.819 --> 19:50.419
Oh, uh, sure.

19:50.421 --> 19:51.720
Awesome!

19:51.722 --> 19:54.289
Now all we need
are some cool costumes,

19:54.291 --> 19:56.659
fancy-looking equipment
and a cat.

19:56.661 --> 20:00.563
- A cat?
- Yeah, after we "beat" the monster,

20:00.565 --> 20:02.765
we show your brother
that we have him in a bag.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.770
If we have cat in the bag,
it'll be moving and stuff.

20:06.703 --> 20:08.539
I'm not
putting a cat in a bag.

20:09.339 --> 20:10.605
Fine, then you think of a way

20:10.607 --> 20:12.844
to make it look like
we've captured a monster.

20:15.313 --> 20:16.612
I have an idea.

20:21.352 --> 20:23.552
- What d'ya think?
- It's cool.

20:23.554 --> 20:25.921
We put in the bag,
it moves around

20:25.923 --> 20:27.823
and then your brother thinks
there's a monster in it.

20:27.825 --> 20:30.328
This might be the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

20:30.928 --> 20:33.028
Why do you have it?

20:33.030 --> 20:35.965
Well, my dad makes all the props for
the haunted houses around town.

20:35.967 --> 20:36.835
You can check it out.

20:38.568 --> 20:40.372
Whoa, that is so cool.

20:41.806 --> 20:42.607
Whoa!

20:43.074 --> 20:44.476
Your dad's awesome!

20:44.842 --> 20:46.278
Yeah, he is pretty great.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.313
- What happened to you?
- Dylan!

20:49.980 --> 20:51.583
Whoa, check this out.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.288
Childish.

20:58.655 --> 20:59.557
What about this?

21:04.061 --> 21:05.796
Ha-ha, very funny.

21:06.064 --> 21:07.662
All right, let's stop messing
around and help me look for stuff

21:07.664 --> 21:09.401
to makes us look
like monster hunters.

21:44.669 --> 21:46.738
We. Look. Awesome.

21:47.137 --> 21:48.636
Yes, we do.

21:48.638 --> 21:51.640
Guys, say hello
to the Monster Busters.

21:51.642 --> 21:53.909
- The what?
- The Monster Busters.

21:53.911 --> 21:56.347
- Like Ghostbusters?
- Yeah.

21:56.748 --> 22:00.015
Uh, I was thinking something
more like "The Monsterminators."

22:00.017 --> 22:01.016
The what?

22:01.018 --> 22:02.651
The Monsterminators?

22:02.653 --> 22:04.487
'Cause we're like
monster exterminators.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.854
I took the two
and put them together.

22:05.856 --> 22:08.891
Exterminator sounds
a little violent.

22:08.893 --> 22:11.059
Okay, um...
I got it!

22:11.061 --> 22:12.594
The Monster Squad.

22:12.596 --> 22:13.996
- That's already been taken.
- Are you sure?

22:13.998 --> 22:15.967
Yeah, my dad owns it
on Blu-ray.

22:16.601 --> 22:17.736
He watches it all the time.

22:18.836 --> 22:20.769
Well, I... I still vote
on the Monster Squad anyway.

22:20.771 --> 22:22.404
Who's with me?

22:22.406 --> 22:25.408
The Monster Squad sounds
like we're a squad of monsters.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.978
We're not monsters.

22:27.577 --> 22:28.777
How about
the Creature Fighters?

22:28.779 --> 22:31.881
- Nah.
- Can we sidebar this discussion?

22:31.883 --> 22:34.583
I can't be out too late
and I have tons of homework.

22:34.585 --> 22:35.718
Agreed.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.686
Let's go fight some monsters.

22:37.688 --> 22:38.724
Groovy!

23:00.076 --> 23:01.113
Alex...

23:02.946 --> 23:05.180
- What are you up to?
- You'll see.

23:05.182 --> 23:06.484
You're making me nervous.

23:07.151 --> 23:08.153
Gavin!

23:08.885 --> 23:10.154
Gavin, you have visitors!

23:11.455 --> 23:13.122
Oh, who's your new friend?

23:13.124 --> 23:16.158
- This is Phoenix.
- Hi, Phoenix. Cool name.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.726
Nice to meet you.

23:17.728 --> 23:20.563
- Hello, Dylan.
- Hey, Mrs. Parker.

23:20.565 --> 23:24.436
I'm liking this whole foam and
duct tape look you've got going.

23:24.734 --> 23:26.538
We heard you had
a monster problem.

23:27.038 --> 23:28.636
We... do?

23:28.638 --> 23:31.539
Yes, we are here
to bust Gavin's monster.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.511
Oh, right.

23:35.579 --> 23:38.814
Of course.
Gavin's monster problem.

23:38.816 --> 23:41.553
It's big, and scary
and... monster-y.

23:46.190 --> 23:48.192
I always see him there.

23:48.893 --> 23:51.526
Closet monster, huh? I've
dealt with their kind before.

23:51.528 --> 23:53.962
- You have?
- Of course.

23:53.964 --> 23:55.800
Is there anywhere
else in your room that he moves?

23:56.567 --> 24:00.001
He goes over there, and there.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.805
Okay, I think that's enough
information.

24:02.807 --> 24:05.443
Gavin, for your safety, we're gonna need you
to wait outside until we finish this up.

24:06.978 --> 24:08.677
We'll take it from here.

24:08.679 --> 24:10.548
- You sure?
- Yeah, we got it all under control.

24:11.249 --> 24:12.183
Okay

24:16.153 --> 24:18.053
Phoenix, whatcha got?

24:18.055 --> 24:20.555
Air vent blowing on the curtains,
I'll adjust the airflow.

24:20.557 --> 24:22.027
- I'll check the closet.
- Let's do this.

24:34.137 --> 24:35.871
Squeaky hinges fixed.
What else?

24:35.873 --> 24:38.873
We see branch.
He sees big, scary monster hand.

24:38.875 --> 24:39.845
On it.

24:46.983 --> 24:48.986
No more monster under the bed.

24:50.788 --> 24:53.057
- Anything else?
- I think that's it.

24:53.723 --> 24:55.157
Well, that was easy.
Let's go.

24:55.159 --> 24:58.893
Wait... now it's time
for the best part.

24:58.895 --> 25:00.097
What do you mean?

25:00.798 --> 25:02.998
Initiating monster fight.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.267
Ahhh! There he is! Get him!

25:06.269 --> 25:07.538
He's getting away!

25:08.306 --> 25:09.604
Jump on his back!

25:09.606 --> 25:12.641
Are they gonna be Okay?

25:12.643 --> 25:14.309
I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine.

25:16.646 --> 25:18.680
Alex, is everything okay
in there?

25:18.682 --> 25:20.949
Yeah, Mom, we almost got him!

25:20.951 --> 25:23.654
Here! Put him in the monster
containment unit!

25:26.691 --> 25:29.658
Get in there, monster!

25:29.660 --> 25:31.626
Can't you be more believable?

25:31.628 --> 25:32.861
I'm not an actor!

25:32.863 --> 25:34.129
Watch the master.

25:34.131 --> 25:36.164
Ahh! Ooh!

25:36.166 --> 25:40.235
Phoenix!
Grab the monster cannon!

25:40.237 --> 25:42.871
- Got it!
- Now say you don't have a clear shot.

25:42.873 --> 25:44.672
- What?
- Say you don't have a clear shot.

25:44.674 --> 25:47.109
But I don't have a good shot!

25:47.111 --> 25:48.680
Just shoot!

25:50.714 --> 25:53.181
You did it!
You saved my life!

25:53.183 --> 25:54.685
It was nothing.

25:57.153 --> 25:59.022
I got it, I got it.
You're grateful.

26:03.094 --> 26:05.997
We came, we saw,
we kicked its monster butt.

26:06.730 --> 26:07.962
Where's the monster?

26:07.964 --> 26:09.898
It's locked in our
special containment unit.

26:11.368 --> 26:13.070
Now what do you do with him?

26:13.371 --> 26:16.641
So what we do is... um...

26:17.141 --> 26:18.710
Uhh...

26:20.845 --> 26:22.777
We have a trans-dimensional
portal.

26:22.779 --> 26:25.046
We're gonna place him into a
world with other monsters.

26:25.048 --> 26:28.150
There he'll be happy and not feel
the need to terrorize you anymore.

26:28.152 --> 26:30.318
- What she said.
- Yep.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.156
You really got the monster?

26:32.923 --> 26:33.791
We did.

26:35.259 --> 26:37.761
Thank you, he was so scary.

26:38.095 --> 26:39.894
I told you I'd always
protect you, buddy.

26:39.896 --> 26:42.266
Thanks, we really
appreciate it, guys.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.002
We should go,
we have a monster to transport.

26:45.869 --> 26:47.335
Uhh, sure.

26:47.337 --> 26:49.037
Yeah, just take your phone.
And be home by eight.

26:49.039 --> 26:50.307
I will.

26:57.213 --> 26:58.346
That... was awesome.

26:58.348 --> 26:59.847
Yeah, it was.

26:59.849 --> 27:02.051
I can't believe
how well it worked.

27:02.053 --> 27:06.257
And kudos to Phoenix's save.
Trans-dimensional portal?

27:06.923 --> 27:09.994
I figured that would be the best way to
safely and humanely get rid of the monster.

27:10.861 --> 27:14.830
There have been some theories on the subject
that have really jumped the research ahead.

27:14.832 --> 27:16.401
I got it, snorefest.
Thank you.

27:19.970 --> 27:23.372
- Hey, sis.
- Whoa, you scared me.

27:23.374 --> 27:25.974
What're you guys doing here
being all creepy?

27:25.976 --> 27:28.142
- Just getting home.
- From what?

27:28.144 --> 27:30.344
Fighting a monster.
We're monster fighters.

27:30.346 --> 27:32.381
Okay...

27:32.383 --> 27:35.150
Phoenix helped me with an
idea to convince my brother

27:35.152 --> 27:38.056
that we fought and captured the
imaginary monster he has in his room.

27:38.756 --> 27:41.489
You, Li'l Miss Book Bug, dressed
up in this crazy costume

27:41.491 --> 27:43.959
to pretend to catch monsters?

27:43.961 --> 27:45.728
Yeah.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.996
Finally shedding your nerd
cocoon to become a butterfly.

27:47.998 --> 27:51.199
Actually, the butterfly
emerges from a chrysalis.

27:51.201 --> 27:52.968
Okay...

27:52.970 --> 27:55.738
Anyway, I can't wait
to tell Mom and Dad.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.171
All right, Taylor,
I'm heading out now.

27:57.173 --> 27:59.141
Okay, text
me this weekend.

27:59.143 --> 28:01.276
- Okay.
- Ashley?

28:01.278 --> 28:03.381
Alex? What are you doing here?

28:04.781 --> 28:06.347
What's with the outfits?

28:06.349 --> 28:07.451
What outfits?

28:08.752 --> 28:10.422
The outfits you all have on.

28:11.188 --> 28:12.921
Oh, these outfits.

28:12.923 --> 28:14.055
Yeah, we dressed up
like this

28:14.057 --> 28:15.289
to help my brother
with something.

28:15.291 --> 28:17.159
It's no big deal.

28:17.161 --> 28:19.460
We acted like monster fighters, so
he could sleep better at night.

28:19.462 --> 28:21.529
We had lights
and special effects,

28:21.531 --> 28:24.232
sound effects, and this thing!

28:24.234 --> 28:25.834
It was epic!

28:25.836 --> 28:27.803
Like I said,
it's no big deal.

28:27.805 --> 28:29.505
I actually think that's
really sweet that you'd

28:29.507 --> 28:31.273
do something like that
for your brother.

28:31.275 --> 28:33.945
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Did it work?

28:34.878 --> 28:36.180
Better than we thought it would.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.346
You guys out to start
marketing yourselves.

28:38.348 --> 28:41.251
I mean, I'm sure a lot of kids
have monsters in their rooms.

28:42.086 --> 28:43.454
We should create
our own business.

28:44.054 --> 28:46.555
I have no idea how to do
something like that.

28:46.557 --> 28:48.856
I could help.
I did this whole marketing thing

28:48.858 --> 28:52.094
for my babysitting business
and it turned out pretty well.

28:52.096 --> 28:53.862
Cool, what should we
start first?

28:53.864 --> 28:54.932
Leave it to me.

28:55.833 --> 28:56.931
Say cheese!

28:56.933 --> 28:58.036
Cheese!

28:59.202 --> 29:00.337
Got it.

29:00.938 --> 29:02.336
And what do you call yourselves?

29:02.338 --> 29:05.340
Well, we haven't quite
figured out our name yet.

29:05.342 --> 29:08.911
How about... Monster Busters?

29:08.913 --> 29:11.212
That's it!
The Monster Busters.

29:11.214 --> 29:12.483
It's... so simple.

29:13.817 --> 29:15.920
- Thanks.
- No problem. I'll see you later.

29:17.954 --> 29:19.022
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.557
What an awesome name, huh?

29:22.559 --> 29:23.991
Monster Busters?

29:23.993 --> 29:26.562
That's literally the first
name I suggested.

29:26.564 --> 29:30.065
Yeah, well... it didn't sound
as good coming from you.

29:30.067 --> 29:32.366
- He's right.
- No one asked you.

29:32.368 --> 29:33.003
Two to one?

29:34.270 --> 29:36.071
It'd be better
if we were unanimous.

29:36.073 --> 29:38.574
Fine. Monster Busters it is.

29:38.576 --> 29:40.944
- But, I get to make the uniform.
- Deal.

29:41.478 --> 29:42.846
All right, Monster Busters,
hands in!

29:44.882 --> 29:45.850
On three.

29:47.151 --> 29:48.851
Monster Busters...

29:48.853 --> 29:50.522
Why didn't you say anything?

29:51.020 --> 29:52.988
- I was waiting for the count.
- Yeah.

29:52.990 --> 29:54.456
I bounced our hands
three times.

29:54.458 --> 29:55.527
Oh.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.992
That wasn't quite clear.

29:57.994 --> 29:59.463
Okay. On bounce three.

30:02.266 --> 30:04.266
Monster Busters!

30:04.268 --> 30:06.334
...busters.

30:06.336 --> 30:07.870
Yeah, we can work
on that later.

30:09.205 --> 30:10.207
We'd better get home.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.975
Guys, watch out for monsters!

30:12.977 --> 30:14.476
- Whoo...
- Yeah, yeah.

30:14.478 --> 30:16.577
Unlike my brother, I know
that monsters aren't real.

30:16.579 --> 30:17.511
All right, see ya guys.

30:17.513 --> 30:19.248
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:19.250 --> 30:19.917
Bye.

30:32.328 --> 30:33.895
I'm home.

30:33.897 --> 30:34.997
Hey, buddy!

30:34.999 --> 30:36.965
Hey, Dad.

30:36.967 --> 30:38.533
Your mom just told me about
this new club you're a part of.

30:38.535 --> 30:40.201
That is so cool.

30:40.203 --> 30:42.504
Thanks, but we're
not really a club.

30:42.506 --> 30:43.875
We're Monsters Busters.

30:44.607 --> 30:46.674
- Monster Busters?
- Yeah.

30:46.676 --> 30:49.044
No... no other
super-cool adjectives...

30:49.046 --> 30:50.582
"Super Mega" Monster Busters?

30:52.182 --> 30:53.951
Nope. Just Monster Busters.

30:56.086 --> 30:57.486
Well, that's pretty catchy.

30:57.488 --> 31:00.354
You know, I was once the leader

31:00.356 --> 31:03.392
of an elite monster fighting
operation, back in my day.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.294
Honey, quit making stuff up.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.065
What? I was!

31:08.031 --> 31:09.698
Your dad loves
to tell these stories.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.433
And she loves to hear them.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.469
Oh, yes I just swoon
over them.

31:14.471 --> 31:16.671
It certainly didn't bother you
when I asked you out.

31:16.673 --> 31:17.642
I asked you out.

31:19.276 --> 31:21.546
So, how's Gavin?

31:22.211 --> 31:23.679
Oh, he's sleeping like a baby.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.212
Really?

31:25.214 --> 31:28.016
Yeah, what you guys did earlier
was really sweet.

31:28.018 --> 31:30.954
You should've seen how happy
he was after you left.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.255
It was nothing.

31:33.257 --> 31:34.623
It wasn't nothing.

31:34.625 --> 31:36.493
You know, Gavin really
looks up to you.

31:37.161 --> 31:39.631
Your mother's right.
I'm really proud of you, son.

31:42.700 --> 31:43.902
Thanks.

31:44.434 --> 31:45.667
Good night.

31:45.669 --> 31:46.638
- Good night.
- Night.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.596
<i>Do you like it?</i>

32:12.730 --> 32:13.996
I love it.
Thanks.

32:13.998 --> 32:15.296
<i>No problem.</i>

32:15.298 --> 32:16.698
<i>I need a project
for my marketing class.</i>

32:16.700 --> 32:18.266
<i>I hope you don't mind.</i>

32:18.268 --> 32:19.700
Of course not.

32:19.702 --> 32:22.139
But do you really think
people will look at it?

32:23.007 --> 32:26.141
<i>It's already had,
like, 141 views.</i>

32:26.143 --> 32:28.980
<i>Oh, and I attached a link for the
flyer for all the non-computer users.</i>

32:29.613 --> 32:32.113
Wow. You're good at this.

32:32.115 --> 32:35.116
<i>Just don't forget
the small people</i>

32:35.118 --> 32:37.385
<i>when Monster Busters
becomes a household name.</i>

32:37.387 --> 32:39.356
Of course.
How could I ever forget you?

32:42.792 --> 32:44.661
<i>Well, I gotta go.
Good night.</i>

32:45.461 --> 32:46.463
Good night.

32:49.732 --> 32:50.701
Hey, you're still up.

32:52.702 --> 32:55.036
- Yeah.
- Who were you talking to?

32:55.038 --> 32:56.206
It's just a girl from school.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.275
What's her name?

32:58.741 --> 33:00.444
Uhh, Ashley Snyder.

33:01.244 --> 33:04.446
Really, Ashley Snyder?
Not bad!

33:04.448 --> 33:07.151
- You know her?
- I work with her mom.

33:07.785 --> 33:09.187
Really?

33:10.054 --> 33:11.422
You mind putting in
a good word for me?

33:12.288 --> 33:15.093
Honey, if you just be yourself,
I won't have to do anything.

33:16.426 --> 33:17.558
Trust me.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.626
Good night.

33:18.628 --> 33:19.496
Good night, Mom.

33:22.499 --> 33:25.135
Watch out, monsters,
Here we come.

33:44.454 --> 33:46.390
We did it.

33:53.564 --> 33:54.629
Hello?

33:54.631 --> 33:57.532
- Dude, we're famous.
- What?

33:57.534 --> 33:59.334
<i>We got a ton of requests
on the site.</i>

33:59.336 --> 34:01.103
I'm heading over
to Phoenix's now.

34:01.105 --> 34:04.105
This weekend, we got some
monster busting to do.

34:04.107 --> 34:06.842
That page your girlfriend made
is the bomb, yo.

34:06.844 --> 34:08.844
She's not my girlfriend.

34:08.846 --> 34:10.579
Blah, blah, blah.
Whatever.

34:10.581 --> 34:11.681
Meet us in an hour.

34:12.382 --> 34:13.317
All right, see ya.

34:19.389 --> 34:20.822
Whoa.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.693
- You like?
- I like.

34:23.559 --> 34:25.163
I spent all night
making these.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.661
These are awesome.

34:27.664 --> 34:29.400
I made us these.

34:33.536 --> 34:34.672
You like?

34:35.505 --> 34:36.574
I love!

34:38.842 --> 34:39.844
Oh, I almost forgot.

34:40.677 --> 34:41.813
I have these.

34:42.913 --> 34:43.911
- Fireworks?
- Yeah.

34:43.914 --> 34:45.478
For what?

34:45.481 --> 34:46.715
In case we need them.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.416
This is the piece
de resistance.

34:49.418 --> 34:51.721
- It's called the Big Bertha.
- What's it do?

34:52.356 --> 34:54.356
I don't know,
but I can't wait to find out!

34:54.358 --> 34:56.422
- No.
- Come on!

34:56.425 --> 34:58.592
We're not blowing up some
kid's room with a rocket.

34:58.594 --> 35:00.564
Fine. You're being
such a killjoy.

35:01.331 --> 35:03.468
Well, I don't even know what
that is, so I'm not offended.

35:03.900 --> 35:04.668
All right, let's suit up.

35:06.670 --> 35:07.771
Minus the fireworks.

35:09.239 --> 35:10.608
Fine.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.409
There's only one thing
left to do.

35:13.342 --> 35:14.611
Bust some monsters.

35:28.224 --> 35:32.195
My monster has one eye
and five arms.

35:35.699 --> 35:37.699
All right. Thank you,
we'll take it from here.

35:37.701 --> 35:39.137
What?

35:39.570 --> 35:43.274
Sir, excuse us, but,
we have a monster to handle.

35:45.509 --> 35:46.409
All right.

35:47.543 --> 35:48.211
And, uh...

35:50.813 --> 35:53.583
Let's do this!

35:54.918 --> 35:56.220
Dylan, you take sound.

35:56.753 --> 35:58.686
Got it.

35:58.688 --> 36:01.222
- Phoenix, get to your position.
- Got it.

36:02.826 --> 36:05.228
Monster portal, open.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.503
Here we go.

36:15.505 --> 36:17.441
Wow, look at those...

36:18.342 --> 36:19.544
...five arms!

36:21.945 --> 36:24.512
And terrible, scary eyes!

36:24.514 --> 36:25.646
One eye.

36:25.648 --> 36:27.849
- Eye!
- Just stop talking.

36:27.851 --> 36:29.684
Sorry.

36:29.686 --> 36:31.885
Laser containment unit,
activate.

36:31.887 --> 36:35.559
Laser containment unit,
initiated!

36:36.260 --> 36:37.992
Phoenix, fire the Eye Buster.

36:37.994 --> 36:39.963
Eye Buster, fired!

36:43.833 --> 36:46.001
- Pretend!
- Oops.

36:46.003 --> 36:47.702
Wh.. What was that?

36:47.704 --> 36:49.537
Uh, nothing!

36:49.539 --> 36:50.374
Help me pick this up.

36:51.775 --> 36:53.543
We're almost done!

36:54.543 --> 36:55.712
That's it, I'm going in.

36:58.481 --> 37:00.882
Good news.
Your monster's been busted.

37:02.552 --> 37:03.885
Wow!

37:03.887 --> 37:05.590
Thanks, Monster Busters!

37:06.456 --> 37:08.555
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Yeah, thanks guys.

37:08.557 --> 37:09.726
I really appreciate it.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.992
Oh, hey, let me
get you a somethin'.

37:11.994 --> 37:14.628
- Uh, no, no, no, that's not necessary.
- Oh, no, no, no I insist.

37:14.630 --> 37:17.634
Buy yourself some candy,
or whatever you kids buy today.

37:18.668 --> 37:19.767
Thanks!

37:30.047 --> 37:31.414
Man!

38:24.400 --> 38:25.867
Monster Busters.

38:25.869 --> 38:28.606
- For all your monster problems.
- Thank you.

38:30.873 --> 38:33.108
I didn't know we had
our own advertising team.

38:33.110 --> 38:35.543
- Wow, great job guys.
- Thanks.

38:35.545 --> 38:38.746
We've been working all day.
This is my friend, Sophie.

38:38.748 --> 38:40.981
Hey, Sophie.
Thanks for passing out flyers.

38:40.983 --> 38:42.784
No problem. It's fun!

38:42.786 --> 38:44.786
You know, since you guys have
been helping us out so much,

38:44.788 --> 38:48.889
how about we make you guys...
junior Monster Busters?

38:48.891 --> 38:50.157
Wow!

38:50.159 --> 38:51.126
Thanks.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.626
Congratulations.

38:52.628 --> 38:54.461
Just remember
to honor that title,

38:54.463 --> 38:56.333
and make sure no monster
goes un-busted.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.502
We will!

38:58.902 --> 39:01.105
And remember to always have each
other's backs, no matter what.

39:01.771 --> 39:02.706
Okay!

39:03.139 --> 39:05.408
- Bye!
- Bye!

39:06.909 --> 39:09.043
- What's next?
- Next we have Brad Feren.

39:09.045 --> 39:11.912
His monster's
a squirrel monster?

39:11.914 --> 39:13.680
A squirrel monster?

39:13.682 --> 39:14.951
How could that be scary?

39:15.485 --> 39:18.456
'Kay. What are we
calling the gun?

39:18.922 --> 39:20.722
How about...
the Nut Buster.

39:20.724 --> 39:24.394
- Sounds good.
- All right. Let's do this.

39:26.797 --> 39:29.430
Aren't you a little old
to be having a monster?

39:29.432 --> 39:32.032
No, it's a squirrel monster,
it tries to get me all the time.

39:32.034 --> 39:34.437
All right.

39:36.773 --> 39:39.139
Are you sure it's not
a garbage monster?

39:39.141 --> 39:41.578
- This place is a dump.
- Dylan!

39:42.179 --> 39:43.447
Come on, let's
check the air vents.

39:47.451 --> 39:50.217
Careful. The only difference
between a squirrel and a rat

39:50.219 --> 39:52.655
is a bushy tail
and a better PR person.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.871
- It's not funny.
- It was, a little.

40:09.873 --> 40:12.143
You should have seen yourself,
you were so scared.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.675
Whatever, you would've
done the same thing.

40:14.677 --> 40:16.579
Psh! I'm not scared of anything.

40:34.231 --> 40:35.863
Get him off! Get him off!

40:35.865 --> 40:37.264
It's gonna give me rabies!

40:37.266 --> 40:38.867
Get him off! Get him off!

40:38.869 --> 40:41.635
Guys, help!
Come on, guys, help!

40:41.637 --> 40:43.737
Help! Where is it?
Where is it?

40:43.739 --> 40:44.942
Where'd it go?

40:46.742 --> 40:48.041
Okay. I think it's gone.

40:52.983 --> 40:55.586
Nice work, you got
rid of the big, bad squirrel.

40:57.586 --> 40:59.720
Gordon Peters?
You set this up?

40:59.722 --> 41:01.923
- Maybe.
- It wasn't very funny.

41:01.925 --> 41:04.092
No. It was hilarious.

41:04.094 --> 41:05.760
And you'll be able to see it
online in three, two...

41:05.762 --> 41:08.028
- Oh, come on don't post that!
- Posted.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.530
Too late.

41:09.532 --> 41:11.298
Prepare to go viral,
scaredy cats.

41:11.300 --> 41:13.635
You guys are so childish.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.969
What's the matter,
you weren't scared?

41:14.971 --> 41:15.673
Nope.

41:16.606 --> 41:18.106
Not when have this.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.606
Record this.

41:19.608 --> 41:20.643
What is that?

41:25.614 --> 41:27.081
It's called the Nut Buster.

41:27.083 --> 41:28.184
Anyone else?

41:31.987 --> 41:33.320
I'm gonna get you guys!

41:35.057 --> 41:37.561
- -Prepare to
go viral, scaredy cat!

41:38.128 --> 41:39.994
That was amazing!

41:39.996 --> 41:42.697
- Has anyone told you you're amazing?
- Yes.

41:42.699 --> 41:45.032
- Thanks, Phee.
- No problem.

41:45.034 --> 41:47.103
It's getting late. We better get home.
School tomorrow.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.807
That was awesome.

41:53.809 --> 41:56.177
Let's not forget about how
brave Dylan was with that squirrel.

41:56.179 --> 41:58.447
"Ahh, get it off me!"

42:09.059 --> 42:10.261
Did you have something
to do with this?

42:13.362 --> 42:14.631
Maybe.

42:17.233 --> 42:18.700
Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.334
I mean, the whole thing
was like...

42:20.336 --> 42:24.104
Ashley, I need to speak
with Mr. Parker for a moment.

42:24.106 --> 42:25.543
Okay. See you later.

42:27.077 --> 42:27.745
Bye.

42:30.246 --> 42:34.014
So, I... I see that you
and some of your colleagues

42:34.016 --> 42:37.084
are making quite a name for
yourself in the monster world?

42:37.086 --> 42:39.757
It's not a big deal.
It's actually quite fun for us.

42:40.289 --> 42:41.291
What?

42:42.759 --> 42:44.628
It's fun for you
scaring children?

42:45.862 --> 42:47.961
Um... Well, no.

42:47.963 --> 42:51.099
What I meant was
we have fun helping them

42:51.101 --> 42:52.769
deal with their
visions of monsters.

42:53.068 --> 42:54.871
I mean, you of all people,
should understand that.

42:55.905 --> 42:58.576
Why should I, of all people,
understand that?

42:59.976 --> 43:00.844
Um...

43:01.744 --> 43:03.110
Well... because...

43:03.112 --> 43:05.847
Didn't... didn't you have monster
problems growing up?

43:05.849 --> 43:07.849
No. Absolutely not.

43:07.851 --> 43:09.784
We Phillips were
a family of scientists.

43:09.786 --> 43:11.755
We know things like monsters
don't exist.

43:12.389 --> 43:14.191
How about your
granddaughter, Sophie?

43:15.425 --> 43:18.095
Sophie is my daughter.
Daughter.

43:20.030 --> 43:22.195
I don't need you filling her
head with false imagery

43:22.197 --> 43:24.233
and ridiculous notions
of monsters.

43:26.001 --> 43:27.704
I'm sorry,
I was just trying to help.

43:28.070 --> 43:31.005
Yeah, well I pay a specialist
a lot of money for that.

43:31.007 --> 43:32.842
I don't really
need your assistance.

43:34.710 --> 43:35.645
Understood.

43:38.815 --> 43:41.751
Um... is there anything else
you need, Mr. Phillips?

43:43.753 --> 43:45.889
Oh, right. Yes.
One more thing.

43:47.791 --> 43:51.762
Mr. Parker, mid-terms
are right around the corner.

43:52.161 --> 43:54.896
As of right now, your grade
is not satisfactory

43:54.898 --> 43:56.900
because of that little test
you missed.

43:57.800 --> 44:01.038
So I would urge you to focus
more on your schoolwork

44:02.072 --> 44:04.041
and less on your extra
curricular activities.

44:06.476 --> 44:09.313
Yeah. Absolutely, that was my plan
the whole time, Mr. Phillips.

44:11.447 --> 44:14.382
Well, good.
That's all, Mr. Parker.

44:14.384 --> 44:15.818
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

44:35.838 --> 44:38.405
Ashley!

44:38.407 --> 44:39.409
What's wrong, Sophie?

44:40.409 --> 44:42.413
I heard a monster roar.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.250
No, no, it's just thunder.
Nothing to worry about.

44:46.750 --> 44:47.784
I heard him.

44:48.818 --> 44:51.054
I'm pretty sure that my house
is monster-free.

44:55.358 --> 44:58.796
- What's wrong?
- Monster!

45:10.106 --> 45:13.110
There's nothing there.
I promise.

45:14.543 --> 45:17.311
Uh... what happened
to my sandwich?

45:17.313 --> 45:20.451
The monster took it!
He's gonna eat us!

45:21.050 --> 45:22.753
Hang on.
I know just what to do.

45:27.389 --> 45:30.793
- -Who is it?
Is it another gig?

45:31.795 --> 45:33.097
It's Ashley.

45:39.068 --> 45:41.472
Well? Answer it,
you bonehead.

45:43.206 --> 45:45.206
Yeah. Right.
I'll just answer it.

45:45.208 --> 45:45.876
No big deal.

45:50.079 --> 45:52.149
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Alex.

45:54.284 --> 45:56.385
Yeah, I know.
I called you.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.856
Right. What's up?

45:59.956 --> 46:00.923
<i>Listen, um...</i>

46:02.090 --> 46:05.126
The girl I'm babysitting
is having some monster issues.

46:05.128 --> 46:07.929
I was hoping that maybe
you guys could come over

46:07.931 --> 46:09.066
<i>and help out a little bit?</i>

46:09.465 --> 46:11.199
Yeah, we could totally do that.

46:11.201 --> 46:13.400
Just text me the address
and we'll be there in a few.

46:13.402 --> 46:15.371
<i>Okay, great.
See you in a few.</i>

46:16.105 --> 46:16.907
Bye.

46:18.974 --> 46:20.810
Let's gear up. We got a
monster to take care of.

46:26.548 --> 46:29.253
Don't worry, the Monster
Busters are on their way.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.155
Where'd my sandwich go?

46:37.427 --> 46:39.429
Ugh! What's that smell?

46:40.295 --> 46:42.431
- Did you fart?
- Ugh. It wasn't me.

46:43.333 --> 46:45.298
- What about you, Phee?
- No!

46:45.300 --> 46:47.103
Well, something stinks.

46:48.871 --> 46:52.241
- I think it's that.
- Gross!

46:53.041 --> 46:56.547
- That must be one massive dog.
- Or maybe it's a monster turd.

46:57.512 --> 46:59.045
A "monsturd." Get it?

46:59.047 --> 47:02.048
- Grow up.
- It is fascinating.

47:02.050 --> 47:04.221
Phoenix, get away
from the monsturd.

47:04.653 --> 47:06.556
See? I coined a new phrase.

47:12.394 --> 47:14.327
- Hey, guys! This is...
- Sophie?

47:14.329 --> 47:15.532
Hi.

47:16.666 --> 47:18.368
I can see you guys
have already met.

47:19.434 --> 47:21.068
Having a monster problem?

47:21.070 --> 47:23.104
Yeah, the monster
is in my house.

47:23.106 --> 47:24.374
Where's your house?

47:30.445 --> 47:31.547
That's your house?

47:33.215 --> 47:34.351
You live next door
to Mr. Phillips?

47:35.217 --> 47:37.019
Yeah, I babysit Sophie
all the time.

47:37.619 --> 47:39.987
Phee and Dylan,
why don't you go check it out.

47:39.989 --> 47:42.356
I mean, Mr. Phillips
is not a big fan of mine.

47:42.358 --> 47:44.428
And I'll stay here
and keep an eye on things.

47:45.061 --> 47:48.295
Uh-huh. We know
what you want to keep an eye on.

47:48.297 --> 47:50.466
I don't know what
you're talking about.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.370
We're talking about you having
some alone time with Ashley.

47:55.170 --> 47:57.006
Just... just go check
on the house for Sophie.

47:59.242 --> 47:59.910
Hi.

48:03.246 --> 48:06.215
Weird. Mr. Phillips still
has his Christmas lights up?

48:07.016 --> 48:08.418
Lazy.

48:17.726 --> 48:19.559
I can't see a thing.

48:19.561 --> 48:21.162
Did you hear that?

48:21.164 --> 48:22.429
Hear what?

48:22.431 --> 48:23.532
That.

48:29.137 --> 48:31.037
- No.
- Yes.

48:31.039 --> 48:33.074
Come on,
it's Sophie's house.

48:33.076 --> 48:34.342
We can't get in trouble.

48:34.344 --> 48:36.978
Besides, if someone's
breaking into her house,

48:36.980 --> 48:38.512
we should catch it
on camera.

48:38.514 --> 48:40.081
Or call the police!

48:40.083 --> 48:41.485
Psh! Come on.

48:52.094 --> 48:54.762
So, I see the Monster Busting
thing is working out pretty well.

48:54.764 --> 48:57.197
Yeah, those flyers you gave us
have really helped out.

48:57.199 --> 48:58.367
And, I mean,
the team is pretty...

48:59.534 --> 49:00.534
...awesome.

49:00.536 --> 49:02.269
Where are they?

49:02.271 --> 49:04.708
I don't see them.
Maybe they went around back?

49:05.574 --> 49:08.277
I can't leave those
guys alone for five minutes.

49:09.244 --> 49:11.378
I guess I should go
check on 'em.

49:11.380 --> 49:13.250
Yeah, I probably need
to check on Sophie.

49:13.548 --> 49:14.581
Want some popcorn?

49:14.583 --> 49:16.085
- Sure.
- Okay.

49:28.130 --> 49:29.199
What the heck is that?

49:30.565 --> 49:32.099
Maybe they have a cat?

49:32.101 --> 49:34.037
That is one scary cat.

49:53.588 --> 49:56.222
- You go take a look.
- No, you take a look!

49:56.224 --> 49:59.730
Fine. On the count
of three, we both look.

50:01.130 --> 50:03.066
- Ready?
- Ready.

50:04.099 --> 50:07.536
One... two... three!

50:54.851 --> 50:57.550
Dylan! Phoenix! Help!

51:15.670 --> 51:16.739
Whoa!

51:29.485 --> 51:32.422
Dylan? Phoenix?
What... what are you guys doing?

51:45.467 --> 51:46.836
What is going on here?

51:48.838 --> 51:51.240
Hi, Mr. Phillips.

51:53.275 --> 51:55.211
Oh, this isn't our yard?

52:00.815 --> 52:02.718
I am so sorry, Mr. Phillips.

52:03.452 --> 52:05.219
He is normally a good boy.

52:05.221 --> 52:06.387
We don't know what
came over him.

52:06.389 --> 52:07.854
I understand what
came over them.

52:07.856 --> 52:09.456
They're hooligans.

52:09.458 --> 52:11.624
It's you I don't understand,
Ashley.

52:11.626 --> 52:14.695
I cannot believe you had a party
at our house while we were gone.

52:14.697 --> 52:17.867
I put my trust in you
and you broke that trust.

52:24.340 --> 52:26.472
Mr. Phillips,
it wasn't a party.

52:26.474 --> 52:28.275
Ashley had nothing
to do with this.

52:28.277 --> 52:29.742
We came over here
to help Sophie.

52:29.744 --> 52:31.248
There was a monster, Daddy.

52:33.248 --> 52:35.782
I thought I told
you to leave her alone.

52:35.784 --> 52:38.318
Now, because of you,
she believes there are monsters.

52:38.320 --> 52:40.320
There are monsters!

52:40.322 --> 52:41.789
Sophie, sweetie, I think it's
time for you to go to bed.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.161
Daddy'll be up
and read you some stories.

52:44.860 --> 52:46.563
She's telling you
the truth, Mr. Phillips.

52:46.929 --> 52:49.996
It's true.
I... I don't know how, but it is.

52:49.998 --> 52:51.300
I don't have time for this.

52:52.300 --> 52:54.203
- Tell him, Alex.
- Tell him what?

52:54.903 --> 52:57.637
That a monster only you saw
drug me around the house?

52:57.639 --> 52:59.542
- You don't believe us?
- What am I supposed to believe?

53:00.242 --> 53:02.211
- That a monster did all this?
- It's true!

53:02.577 --> 53:04.880
Look, all I know is because
of you two, Ashley's in trouble.

53:05.514 --> 53:07.347
Because of us?

53:07.349 --> 53:08.751
You guys have let this Monster
Busting thing go to your head.

53:09.585 --> 53:10.686
I should've never
went along with this.

53:11.853 --> 53:13.320
What're you saying?

53:13.322 --> 53:15.258
I'm saying I'm done
with the Monster Busters.

53:15.824 --> 53:16.826
Come on, Alex.

53:20.563 --> 53:21.965
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

53:22.632 --> 53:25.766
You can expect a bill
once I assess the damages.

53:25.768 --> 53:28.469
- Got it.
- And if I hear any of these kids

53:28.471 --> 53:31.875
doing this Monster Busting
thing again, I may sue.

53:32.907 --> 53:34.210
I bet you will.

53:37.780 --> 53:39.548
I really don't like
that guy.

53:40.782 --> 53:43.450
Calm down.
His behavior is understandable.

53:43.452 --> 53:45.719
I still
don't like him.

53:45.721 --> 53:48.354
And now, I have to
ground you.

53:48.356 --> 53:50.523
I didn't do anything.
It was those two.

53:50.525 --> 53:52.761
Well, then maybe you should spend
a little less time with them.

53:53.396 --> 53:54.331
Not a problem.

53:55.197 --> 53:57.363
So you're not
a Monster Buster anymore?

53:57.365 --> 53:59.733
Gavin, monsters don't exist.

53:59.735 --> 54:02.836
They're just the overactive imaginations
of kids that need to grow up.

54:02.838 --> 54:05.738
Alex, you know not to talk
to your brother like that!

54:05.740 --> 54:06.976
What has
gotten in to you?

54:08.911 --> 54:09.980
They have.

54:15.784 --> 54:17.253
And as for you two...

54:18.420 --> 54:19.588
...I'm gonna call your parents.

54:22.757 --> 54:23.859
What in the world?

54:30.800 --> 54:32.398
Yucky.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.504
Oh... Lord almighty!

54:36.005 --> 54:36.873
Ugh!

55:45.141 --> 55:47.907
Class, class, I'm sure
many of you, like me,

55:47.909 --> 55:51.010
will be spending this weekend
at the Foggy Creek Fair.

55:51.012 --> 55:55.085
Before you do,
study chapter 17.

55:55.717 --> 55:56.617
Enjoy.

55:56.619 --> 55:58.151
Mr. Parker.

55:58.153 --> 56:00.153
Yeah, yeah. I know what you're
gonna say and I'm really sorry.

56:00.155 --> 56:01.056
But I have to go.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.509
You dropped that
the other night.

56:21.643 --> 56:24.144
Guys, I told you,
I don't want to do this anymore.

56:24.146 --> 56:26.447
And when you tossed it on the
ground and threw us under the bus

56:26.449 --> 56:27.083
we read you
loud and clear.

56:28.184 --> 56:30.684
- Then why are you here?
- 'Cause we need your help.

56:30.686 --> 56:33.019
- Help with what?
- To catch this monster.

56:33.021 --> 56:35.188
You've gotta be
kidding me right now.

56:35.190 --> 56:37.124
No. This is serious.

56:37.126 --> 56:40.026
- I haven't been able to sleep since that night.
- Me neither.

56:40.028 --> 56:43.699
That's because you two are victims
of overactive imaginations.

56:44.132 --> 56:47.069
Maybe you should call
the Monster Busters.

56:49.905 --> 56:51.508
So you're saying
you're not gonna help us?

56:52.740 --> 56:53.610
I can't.

56:55.010 --> 56:56.446
Come on, let's go.

56:58.981 --> 57:01.184
I know that you think
we're crazy.

57:01.851 --> 57:03.550
But we know what we saw.

57:03.552 --> 57:04.918
And we're your friends.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.456
You're supposed to have
our backs, remember?

57:16.197 --> 57:17.466
Everything okay?

57:22.103 --> 57:23.639
Yeah.

57:24.239 --> 57:26.041
Still fighting
with your friends?

57:27.041 --> 57:28.076
They're not my friends.

57:29.110 --> 57:30.480
Then how come you're still
thinking about them?

57:32.914 --> 57:33.947
How did you know that?

57:35.784 --> 57:37.586
Call it a mother's intuition.

57:39.288 --> 57:41.490
You know, why don't you take
Gavin and go meet up with them?

57:42.557 --> 57:43.760
Because they're delusional.

57:44.592 --> 57:46.028
They think monsters are real.

57:46.695 --> 57:47.764
That... that's crazy.

57:48.764 --> 57:50.898
Do you remember,
when you were little,

57:50.900 --> 57:54.604
you were convinced you had
an imaginary friend named Billy?

57:54.969 --> 57:59.708
You wouldn't go
anywhere without him.

58:00.809 --> 58:02.708
We used to hold
the door for him,

58:02.710 --> 58:04.780
make him an imaginary
plate of food.

58:05.914 --> 58:06.815
Yeah.

58:08.050 --> 58:09.583
Billy.

58:09.585 --> 58:12.552
And every time you broke
something or made a mess,

58:12.554 --> 58:13.954
you would blame Billy.

58:15.657 --> 58:16.759
I was a weird kid.

58:17.592 --> 58:18.661
Yeah, but we went along with it.

58:19.929 --> 58:21.498
Even though we knew
he wasn't real.

58:23.032 --> 58:23.533
Why?

58:24.833 --> 58:26.068
'Cause, we loved you.

58:26.735 --> 58:28.271
And we knew eventually
you would grow out of it.

58:32.007 --> 58:32.809
And, you know what?

58:33.976 --> 58:36.546
We actually kind of missed
watching you interact with him.

58:39.047 --> 58:42.048
So, you're saying I should be glad
my friends are out of their minds?

58:42.050 --> 58:43.920
I'm saying they're your friends

58:44.286 --> 58:46.655
and you should stand by them
no matter how quirky they are.

58:48.257 --> 58:49.659
They'd do the same for you,
wouldn't they?

58:53.728 --> 58:54.663
Yeah.

58:57.166 --> 58:57.967
You're right.

58:59.367 --> 59:01.834
Then go, bust some monsters.

59:01.836 --> 59:04.840
But please, this time stay
out of Mr. Phillips's way.

59:05.773 --> 59:07.210
I'll try.

59:08.344 --> 59:09.612
Thanks, guys.

59:11.045 --> 59:12.981
Hey, aren't you
forgetting something?

59:14.949 --> 59:15.918
Oh, yeah.

59:18.387 --> 59:19.853
I love you guys.

59:19.855 --> 59:21.057
- Love you, too.
- Love you.

59:30.164 --> 59:34.103
Wow, I didn't realize how much of the
neighborhood you could see from up here.

59:34.670 --> 59:36.235
I hate heights.

59:36.237 --> 59:37.839
Why would you think
I would like this?

59:38.407 --> 59:40.043
I didn't.
I just told you you would.

59:40.775 --> 59:42.242
Great.

59:42.244 --> 59:44.146
Here, take these and start
looking for our monster.

59:52.987 --> 59:54.690
Someone call
for a Monster Buster?

59:56.057 --> 59:57.023
Alex?

59:57.025 --> 59:58.358
Alex!

59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.898
I mean, what're you
doing here, abandoner?

01:00:02.864 --> 01:00:05.834
And anything you're
about to say isn't gonna help.

01:00:06.367 --> 01:00:07.903
Okay, I'm gonna try anyway.

01:00:09.137 --> 01:00:12.342
Phoenix, I've thought about what
you've said, and you're right.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.811
We're friends and we're supposed to have
each other's backs, no matter what.

01:00:16.744 --> 01:00:20.315
Even though I may have my doubts about
this monster, I should help you guys.

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:22.684
'Cause you're my friends.
I'm sorry, I forgot about that.

01:00:28.757 --> 01:00:30.456
I forgive you.
I miss you so much!

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:32.159
Okay, okay, I'm here now.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.262
Me, too.

01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:35.862
Hey, Gavin.
What's up, buddy?

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:37.766
- I'm here to help.
- Oh. Cool.

01:00:38.367 --> 01:00:40.900
But aren't you
scared of monsters?

01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:43.003
I'm a junior Monster Buster.

01:00:43.005 --> 01:00:46.009
- I can't be scared of monsters.
- So what's the plan?

01:00:46.307 --> 01:00:49.041
I'm glad you asked.
Based on our recent encounter,

01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:51.043
I thought it would be smart
to up our tech

01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:53.048
to take care of a beast
of his size.

01:00:53.882 --> 01:00:56.219
Based on the pupils
and sensitivity to light,

01:00:56.885 --> 01:00:58.251
I made us these.

01:00:58.253 --> 01:01:01.320
Oh! Okay, okay!

01:01:01.322 --> 01:01:02.924
Ultra LED lights.

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:05.891
They're super bright
and use very little battery.

01:01:05.893 --> 01:01:07.029
I got it.
Please turn them off.

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:08.994
Right.

01:01:08.996 --> 01:01:10.930
They attach to this body
armor I made.

01:01:10.932 --> 01:01:11.967
Nice.

01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:14.302
Next we have the Net Blaster.

01:01:15.269 --> 01:01:19.139
It uses CO2 canisters to shoot
a large net to capture anything.

01:01:19.141 --> 01:01:20.076
Ooh, dibs!

01:01:22.043 --> 01:01:24.043
You have to reload it
after every shot.

01:01:24.045 --> 01:01:25.878
So make each shot count.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.716
One shot is all I need.

01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:35.021
After that, we have the always
reliable Nut Buster.

01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:36.490
I vote you carry that one.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:39.892
And finally, I made a souped-up
version of my Taser.

01:01:39.894 --> 01:01:43.099
Guaranteed to incapacitate whoever
and whatever gets in its way.

01:01:44.065 --> 01:01:45.331
Guess this one is for you.

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:48.704
Oh, and don't forget
the old bag of fireworks.

01:01:50.172 --> 01:01:51.139
And the Big Bertha!

01:01:51.907 --> 01:01:53.843
Oh, I have another surprise.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:56.909
- I made this.
- What is that?

01:01:56.911 --> 01:01:58.080
It's a grappling hook.

01:01:58.813 --> 01:02:00.916
It shoots zipline and a tether.

01:02:01.282 --> 01:02:03.048
Do you really think
we need one of those?

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.818
We absolutely do!

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:07.387
All right, so we have our tech
to take down this monster.

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:09.054
What's the rest of your plan?

01:02:09.056 --> 01:02:11.193
Well, we stand up here and watch
until we find our monster.

01:02:12.527 --> 01:02:14.863
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:18.030
You didn't create some kind of
monster tracking device thingy?

01:02:18.032 --> 01:02:20.800
No, I was a bit busy
working on everything else.

01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:22.270
Just relax and keep an eye out.

01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:38.918
This is taking forever.
What time is it?

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.052
Don't you have your phone?

01:02:40.054 --> 01:02:41.521
No, I lost it.

01:02:41.523 --> 01:02:43.190
That's not good.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:45.193
Yeah, I threw it at the monster
and he ate it.

01:02:46.027 --> 01:02:47.496
- The monster ate your phone?
- Yup.

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:49.429
That's awesome!

01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:51.197
- It is?
- Yeah.

01:02:51.199 --> 01:02:53.435
All we have to do is use Find My
Phone to track his phone.

01:02:53.969 --> 01:02:56.072
And if the monster ate it, it'll
tell us exactly where it is.

01:02:56.938 --> 01:02:57.906
You're a genius!

01:02:58.239 --> 01:02:59.572
Phoenix, gimme your phone.

01:02:59.574 --> 01:03:01.941
I love how I can invent
all these gadgets

01:03:01.943 --> 01:03:05.882
and all Alex has to do is mention an
app and he gets the title, "genius."

01:03:07.114 --> 01:03:08.950
I got it!

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:11.219
According to this,
he's only one mile away.

01:03:12.253 --> 01:03:13.155
Let's go!

01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:19.829
Geronimo!

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.628
This is awesome! Whoo!

01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:26.099
That was awesome!

01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:28.137
I'm gonna send the tether
back for you...

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.503
- ...guys.
- Don't bother.

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:33.241
How did you guys
get down here so fast?

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.178
We used the ladder.

01:03:36.077 --> 01:03:37.880
I bet that wasn't
as cool as what I did.

01:03:38.313 --> 01:03:39.646
I'll bet it wasn't.

01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:40.817
All right, let's go.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.854
Guys, wait up,
I think I tweaked my ankle.

01:04:12.947 --> 01:04:15.382
Shh! Can you please be quiet?

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.217
You're the one who
stepped on something.

01:04:17.219 --> 01:04:20.487
Oh, I know that.
Just be quiet.

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.090
How close are we?

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:24.926
According to this,
is should be right here.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.526
I don't see anything.

01:04:27.528 --> 01:04:29.130
Try calling his phone.

01:04:29.697 --> 01:04:30.866
Good idea.

01:04:31.532 --> 01:04:32.400
You're a genius.

01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:37.072
It's coming from over there.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.210
Guys. Let's shine our lights
on three....

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:43.913
One... two...

01:05:00.027 --> 01:05:02.061
Charging?

01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:03.162
Phee!

01:05:03.164 --> 01:05:05.268
On it!

01:05:16.043 --> 01:05:17.179
Gavin, it's all you!

01:05:37.699 --> 01:05:39.367
You did it, buddy!

01:05:40.135 --> 01:05:42.538
I can't believe it.
You were right.

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:44.637
You were right.

01:05:44.639 --> 01:05:47.977
Uh, guys...
A little help here?

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:50.313
Oh, right.

01:05:52.347 --> 01:05:54.046
- How did you even...?
- Whoa!

01:05:56.184 --> 01:05:57.751
Everyone okay?

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:58.688
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:01.220
Now all we have to do
is figure out

01:06:01.222 --> 01:06:02.257
what we're gonna
do with our monster.

01:06:03.425 --> 01:06:04.360
What monster?

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.000
He's moving. And moving fast.
Let's go.

01:06:18.239 --> 01:06:19.674
He went to the amusement park?

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.251
Where'd he go?

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:34.420
It says he's
around here somewhere.

01:06:34.422 --> 01:06:36.157
Why would he come
to a populated area?

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:37.993
How could he possibly hide here?

01:06:41.563 --> 01:06:42.231
There he is!

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:52.072
Whoa, whoa, whoa, kids,
the entrance is around front.

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.572
But, there's a monster in there.

01:06:53.574 --> 01:06:56.511
Yeah, it's a haunted house.
That's kind of the point.

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:57.780
You still gotta buy a ticket.

01:06:58.512 --> 01:06:59.481
Come on.

01:07:00.648 --> 01:07:01.616
Nice outfits.

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:10.726
Alex?

01:07:11.492 --> 01:07:12.460
Ashley?

01:07:14.228 --> 01:07:15.497
We'll get the tickets.

01:07:17.599 --> 01:07:19.035
What are you doing here?

01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:21.036
You first.

01:07:22.103 --> 01:07:24.339
Just hanging out with some friends.
What about you?

01:07:26.074 --> 01:07:29.110
Well, this is gonna sound crazy, but we're
chasing a monster and it's in the haunted house.

01:07:30.778 --> 01:07:33.349
Yeah, you're right.
That does sound crazy.

01:07:34.115 --> 01:07:37.349
Can you do me a favor and watch Gavin for
a few minutes while we check this out?

01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:39.721
- I'm going with you.
- No, you aren't.

01:07:40.722 --> 01:07:44.157
Look, buddy, I know you can handle this, but
I need you to stay out here and keep watch.

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:45.394
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.

01:07:46.494 --> 01:07:48.461
- Can you please watch him?
- Yeah, sure.

01:07:48.463 --> 01:07:49.632
Got 'em.

01:07:51.432 --> 01:07:53.101
- Thanks. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:07:54.469 --> 01:07:56.735
Yeah. Sorry.

01:07:56.737 --> 01:07:58.338
Thanks for not hating me.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.309
I could never hate you.
You just owe me.

01:08:01.443 --> 01:08:02.111
Alex!

01:08:10.885 --> 01:08:12.554
Not him!

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.554
Whoa, there, geeks.

01:08:14.556 --> 01:08:16.455
Looks like you still think
it's trick or treating time.

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:18.357
Just take our tickets, Gordon.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.528
What if I don't want to? I could
refuse service to anyone, you know.

01:08:21.496 --> 01:08:22.765
Go ahead.

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:25.600
Tickets, please.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:29.604
Thank you!

01:08:37.212 --> 01:08:38.848
Monster one and two do you copy?

01:08:44.452 --> 01:08:45.886
<i>Monster one
and two do you copy?</i>

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:49.657
Yeah, I copy.

01:08:50.557 --> 01:08:51.694
I got the Monster Squad
headed your way.

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:55.596
Give them something a little...
extra special.

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:58.298
Understood.

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.787
Did your dad help make this?

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:23.492
No, this is an
embarrassment to haunted houses.

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:27.194
Keep your eyes peeled.
The monster could be anywhere.

01:09:30.798 --> 01:09:32.167
Oh!

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.237
Sorry.

01:10:00.328 --> 01:10:02.598
We need to be more careful with
things so we don't hurt anyone else.

01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:12.674
Oh... Sorry about that.

01:10:13.908 --> 01:10:15.508
Are you okay?

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:19.547
I-I'm... f-fine.

01:10:20.381 --> 01:10:23.351
What are you guys
supposed to be?

01:10:24.452 --> 01:10:26.255
Monster Busters.

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:29.891
Okay, this place
is so stupid.

01:10:34.362 --> 01:10:35.530
See? It's not even
that scary.

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:37.432
This is so lame.

01:10:38.065 --> 01:10:39.999
Ooh, scary guy
in a costume.

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:57.650
It's him! Get him!

01:11:15.569 --> 01:11:16.337
Thank you.

01:11:34.021 --> 01:11:35.990
I should be in there with them.

01:11:38.393 --> 01:11:39.395
Gavin!

01:11:41.496 --> 01:11:44.033
You cannot run off like that.
I was worried sick.

01:11:50.872 --> 01:11:52.675
Ashley!

01:11:56.944 --> 01:11:58.479
You leave her alone!

01:12:06.087 --> 01:12:07.022
This way!

01:12:10.425 --> 01:12:11.092
Gavin?

01:12:12.092 --> 01:12:13.429
He took them!

01:12:14.128 --> 01:12:14.997
He's heading that way.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.463
I bet he's heading
to the old cave.

01:12:17.465 --> 01:12:18.467
Then that's
where we're heading.

01:12:25.105 --> 01:12:27.408
- What happened?
- Those Monster nerds attacked us.

01:12:27.742 --> 01:12:29.642
You got beat by those geeks?

01:12:29.644 --> 01:12:31.110
Well, there must have
been, like, 20 of them.

01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:32.644
No, there's, like,
three of them.

01:12:32.646 --> 01:12:34.147
I saw them.
Which way did they go?

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.584
Out back towards the woods.

01:12:36.016 --> 01:12:36.918
Let's go.

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.751
- Doh!
- Oh, Mr. Phillips, I'm so sorry.

01:12:39.753 --> 01:12:41.023
Gordon... Gordon.

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.758
- Come on!
- Let's get those Monster Busters!

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.962
Nice balloon.

01:12:47.895 --> 01:12:51.032
Daddy, they're gonna hurt
the Monster Busters.

01:12:53.134 --> 01:12:54.470
Monster Busters.

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.972
I'll get to the bottom of this.

01:13:03.077 --> 01:13:04.811
All right, Monster Busters,
this is it.

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:07.548
There's no turning back now.
We have to stick together.

01:13:08.216 --> 01:13:09.785
- I got your back.
- Me, too.

01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:12.587
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.457
On three.

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:18.594
Monster Busters!

01:13:19.092 --> 01:13:19.862
Let's do this.

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:31.840
Lights.

01:13:52.226 --> 01:13:54.762
Eww. What's that smell?

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:58.763
The monster must be stealing people's
trash and bringing it here to eat.

01:13:58.765 --> 01:14:00.902
Ugh. The smell is horrible.

01:14:01.802 --> 01:14:02.904
We found the culprit.

01:14:03.671 --> 01:14:05.606
See? Another monsturd.

01:14:14.148 --> 01:14:15.217
I found my phone!

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:17.183
Oh, gross!

01:14:17.185 --> 01:14:18.985
Selfie!

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:23.188
Remind me to never ask
to use your phone. Eww.

01:14:24.591 --> 01:14:25.693
Guys, guys,
turn your lights off.

01:14:26.594 --> 01:14:27.663
We don't want to give away
our position.

01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:57.692
Dude, he's taking their souls.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:07.767
Not on my watch.

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:09.704
Hey, ugly!
You wanna mess with someone?

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:10.972
Mess with us!

01:15:11.605 --> 01:15:12.907
Lights!

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.591
Oh, come on!

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.102
Hit him again!

01:15:42.369 --> 01:15:44.139
I can't.
It's charging.

01:15:49.277 --> 01:15:50.578
It's charged.

01:15:59.787 --> 01:16:00.655
Let her go!

01:16:01.689 --> 01:16:02.621
Shoot him!

01:16:02.623 --> 01:16:03.724
I don't have a clear shot.

01:16:04.057 --> 01:16:05.327
Just shoot!

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.262
Hey, monster!

01:16:10.264 --> 01:16:12.234
I'm about to rock your world!

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.576
I can't believe that worked.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.612
Nice shootin', Tex.

01:16:24.779 --> 01:16:27.182
Yeah, that was amazing.

01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:30.319
Eh, that was nothin'.

01:16:32.353 --> 01:16:33.654
What did you do to them, huh?

01:16:34.689 --> 01:16:35.757
What did you do to my brother
and girlfriend?

01:16:36.323 --> 01:16:37.658
"Girlfriend"?

01:16:40.328 --> 01:16:41.730
Alex?

01:16:43.664 --> 01:16:44.666
Ashley?

01:16:50.137 --> 01:16:51.903
I thought the monster
stole your souls.

01:16:51.905 --> 01:16:54.743
- Yeah, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:57.244
It was strange.

01:16:57.944 --> 01:17:00.782
I remember twisting my ankle,
and I hit my head.

01:17:02.382 --> 01:17:04.118
Then I was floating.

01:17:04.952 --> 01:17:06.718
And he put his hand
over my wounds.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.289
He made the hurt go away.

01:17:09.023 --> 01:17:11.360
- Come again?
- Yeah. He healed us.

01:17:12.126 --> 01:17:12.828
Look.

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.764
It was so cool!

01:17:19.766 --> 01:17:21.299
I got to see inside his brain.

01:17:21.301 --> 01:17:23.001
Come again?

01:17:23.003 --> 01:17:25.437
Yeah, it was like when
he was healing us,

01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:28.040
we were... connected.

01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:30.209
That's weird.
Even for me.

01:17:30.211 --> 01:17:32.780
I saw his home, and how
he's trapped in our world.

01:17:34.015 --> 01:17:35.384
All he wants to do is go home.

01:17:36.117 --> 01:17:37.316
I call shenanigans.

01:17:37.318 --> 01:17:39.985
All he's been wanting to do
is jack us up.

01:17:39.987 --> 01:17:41.789
No, it makes sense.

01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:44.859
He never actually
harmed us.

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:47.793
All he was trying to do
was protect himself.

01:17:47.795 --> 01:17:49.294
From our attacks.

01:17:49.296 --> 01:17:51.496
Oh come on,
he tried to eat us.

01:17:51.498 --> 01:17:53.234
His teeth were this
close to my face.

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:55.704
Now, isn't that right?

01:17:58.271 --> 01:17:59.408
Great.

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.809
Next time can someone
please have eyes on him?

01:18:02.443 --> 01:18:03.445
He's gonna try
to sneak up on us.

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:07.882
Well, well, well If it isn't our
little friends, the Monster Busters.

01:18:08.349 --> 01:18:10.252
Oh, look, they dropped
their toy.

01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:12.918
My friends don't really appreciate
what you did to them back there.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.853
No, we really didn't.

01:18:14.855 --> 01:18:17.224
Look, I'm really sorry.
It was an honest mistake.

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:18.960
Oh, you're
gonna be sorry.

01:18:19.426 --> 01:18:21.395
No, I think I'll take
the first shot.

01:18:22.195 --> 01:18:24.166
And, since I won't hit a girl,
who will take her place?

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.101
I will!

01:18:26.967 --> 01:18:29.335
- No. I will.
- I said I will.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.236
No, I will!

01:18:31.238 --> 01:18:33.140
Enough! This one's got your name
written all over it, Parker.

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:34.810
What's your problem
with me, huh?

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:36.742
You've always
just been a jerk to me.

01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:39.146
I just don't like losers.
And you... are a loser.

01:18:40.314 --> 01:18:42.718
I'm not a loser.
I'm a Monster Buster.

01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:46.121
Lights out, Monster Buster.

01:18:47.054 --> 01:18:49.821
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:18:49.823 --> 01:18:51.225
What's going on here?

01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:55.861
Mr. Phillips,
what're you doing here?

01:18:55.863 --> 01:18:58.033
I warned all of you,

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.532
that if you kept up with
this Monster Busting thing,

01:19:00.534 --> 01:19:02.500
there would be consequences.

01:19:02.502 --> 01:19:03.936
But you don't understand.

01:19:03.938 --> 01:19:05.905
There really are monsters.

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:08.107
- I've heard enough.
- Yeah. Me, too.

01:19:08.109 --> 01:19:10.543
You're all acting
like children!

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:11.576
Look at you!

01:19:11.578 --> 01:19:13.946
In your ridiculous costumes!

01:19:13.948 --> 01:19:16.281
Playing in a cave!

01:19:16.283 --> 01:19:18.349
That's what's wrong
with kids these days.

01:19:18.351 --> 01:19:20.885
Huh? You just let your
imagination run wild

01:19:20.887 --> 01:19:23.121
without any basis
in scientific fact.

01:19:23.123 --> 01:19:25.391
When I was a kid,
we didn't do these crazy things.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:26.962
We had video games!

01:19:28.362 --> 01:19:31.296
Now, I want all of you out
of here right now.

01:19:31.298 --> 01:19:32.434
But, what
about the monster?

01:19:33.033 --> 01:19:34.366
Are you not listening to me?

01:19:34.368 --> 01:19:36.302
I told you.

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:39.341
There is no such thing
as monsters, and that's final!

01:19:41.509 --> 01:19:43.845
Uh...
Mr. Phillips?

01:19:44.912 --> 01:19:45.881
What?

01:19:47.981 --> 01:19:49.551
We... we tried to tell you.

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:51.787
Tell me what?

01:19:52.987 --> 01:19:54.122
Oh, you mean the...

01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:07.135
Sorry, Mr. Phillips!

01:20:15.208 --> 01:20:18.947
It's okay.
They won't hurt you anymore.

01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:22.013
No, he's right.

01:20:22.015 --> 01:20:23.581
We don't want
to fight anymore, do we?

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:24.819
- No.
- No.

01:20:36.564 --> 01:20:37.865
Easy, buddy.

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:57.352
Oh, I love Twinkies.

01:21:10.997 --> 01:21:13.999
Ugh. Still love 'em?

01:21:16.069 --> 01:21:18.169
- Eat it.
- I am not gonna eat that.

01:21:18.171 --> 01:21:20.039
- You have to now!
- You eat it.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.909
He's offering it to you!

01:21:24.645 --> 01:21:26.014
Take one for the team.

01:21:37.123 --> 01:21:38.326
Ohhh.

01:21:39.292 --> 01:21:40.527
Mmm!

01:21:42.496 --> 01:21:43.632
Good.

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.536
Can we please leave before
he makes me eat something else?

01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:52.606
Good idea. We'd better be
getting home anyway.

01:21:54.975 --> 01:21:57.444
Wait. We have to help him.

01:21:58.979 --> 01:22:01.081
Yeah. He needs to be
in his home.

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:02.684
Away from all of this.

01:22:03.417 --> 01:22:03.951
How?

01:22:05.152 --> 01:22:07.288
His home is down there.

01:22:13.027 --> 01:22:14.429
Is... is that your home?

01:22:17.364 --> 01:22:19.266
You know, home?

01:22:22.302 --> 01:22:26.073
I don't believe his mouth has the
capability to make the same noises we do.

01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:28.009
Well, obviously.

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:29.444
That's so sad.

01:22:30.043 --> 01:22:32.180
See? We have to help him.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.115
Well, how are we gonna move
several tons of rock?

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:38.252
I have just the thing.

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:50.498
You guys ready?

01:23:03.377 --> 01:23:04.746
You might want
to plug your ears.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.395
Where's the kaboom?

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:25.367
There's supposed to be
an earth-shattering ka...

01:23:58.832 --> 01:24:00.067
Whoa.

01:24:03.871 --> 01:24:05.140
It's beautiful.

01:24:05.738 --> 01:24:08.042
See how the algae
creates a glow?

01:24:09.109 --> 01:24:11.311
This must be why his
eyes are so sensitive.

01:24:11.712 --> 01:24:14.149
I could spend days here
looking at all the flora.

01:24:14.782 --> 01:24:16.618
Sounds super exciting.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.423
Well, Mr. Monster, it looks
like our work here is done.

01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:25.726
Sorry for the whole
misunderstanding thing.

01:24:26.393 --> 01:24:28.395
I guess we shouldn't assume
all monsters are bad.

01:24:28.695 --> 01:24:32.263
I don't know where we could
have gotten that idea from.

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:33.764
Uh... What?

01:24:33.766 --> 01:24:35.170
How was I
Supposed to know?

01:24:36.636 --> 01:24:37.771
Do you forgive us?

01:24:39.305 --> 01:24:41.540
Ohhh, I think that's a yes.

01:24:55.922 --> 01:24:59.626
If you don't mind, I'm not gonna
hug you, so how 'bout fist bump?

01:25:06.233 --> 01:25:07.769
Hey, don't leave me hangin'.

01:25:10.703 --> 01:25:14.241
That was the worst
pain ever.

01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:16.607
Hey, monster.

01:25:16.609 --> 01:25:18.278
The next time you have to
visit the surface...

01:25:20.247 --> 01:25:22.217
...you'll always be
part of the Monster Busters.

01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:36.631
- Hey...
- Yeah?

01:25:37.363 --> 01:25:38.699
Did you call me
your girlfriend earlier?

01:25:39.832 --> 01:25:41.599
What...? I don't know.

01:25:41.601 --> 01:25:44.369
- Maybe.
- That's what I thought.

01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:47.208
- -Well, I was
caught up in the moment.

01:25:47.541 --> 01:25:50.345
Besides, the monster's not gonna
understand platonic friend that is a girl.

01:25:51.444 --> 01:25:52.913
You're ridiculous.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.483
Hey, um, would you like
to hang out with me, sometime?

01:25:59.319 --> 01:26:00.554
I thought you'd never ask.

01:26:09.762 --> 01:26:12.798
I am not kissing you,
so don't even think about it.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.836
But, I...
I wasn't...

01:26:15.868 --> 01:26:18.906
Yes, you were. I saw it in
your pathetic little face.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:24.445
Tahiti.

01:26:30.717 --> 01:26:32.220
What are we gonna
do with Mr. Phillips?

01:26:33.854 --> 01:26:35.590
Help me carry him home,
I guess.

01:26:45.966 --> 01:26:48.903
All right. It's time
to go face Mr. Phillips.

01:26:49.369 --> 01:26:51.972
I told you, you shouldn't have
left him in his front lawn!

01:26:52.506 --> 01:26:54.339
Hey, the man
was getting heavy.

01:26:54.341 --> 01:26:56.008
Besides, after
the hit he took,

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:57.612
I bet he doesn't
remember a thing.

01:26:58.444 --> 01:27:00.445
Let's hope so.

01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:02.748
If he gives you any hassle, just give
him a bag of sugar-free Gummi Bears.

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:03.751
Sounds good.

01:27:04.784 --> 01:27:06.384
Good luck.

01:27:06.386 --> 01:27:07.652
Thanks, guys.

01:27:07.654 --> 01:27:10.257
Hey. You'll be fine.

01:27:20.634 --> 01:27:22.837
Turn this is in
by the end of class.

01:27:24.904 --> 01:27:25.907
The science test?

01:27:26.472 --> 01:27:27.975
But I thought you hated me.

01:27:30.377 --> 01:27:32.947
Hate is such a strong word,
Mr. Parker.

01:27:33.747 --> 01:27:36.348
I feel that perhaps
I've been a bit too hard on you.

01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:37.852
And for that, I am truly sorry.

01:27:38.851 --> 01:27:40.320
Why the sudden change?

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:44.525
Well, I woke up in my yard,

01:27:45.525 --> 01:27:49.997
after a very odd dream of
you kids in a cave in Tahiti.

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:53.598
And I went inside
and I decided to look

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.471
at the security camera footage
from the other night.

01:27:57.704 --> 01:27:58.372
You saw?

01:28:00.474 --> 01:28:01.409
I saw.

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:06.948
It was nice to know that, one,

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:10.284
I wasn't so crazy
all those years ago.

01:28:10.650 --> 01:28:11.853
And two,

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:15.922
that there are kids like you
out there who can protect us.

01:28:18.091 --> 01:28:19.860
Go Monster Busters.

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.141
Hey, kid.
You running In the halls?

01:28:36.143 --> 01:28:38.710
- No.
- No, I think you were.

01:28:38.712 --> 01:28:40.478
And Murphy High doesn't
like runners.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.679
So, I'm gonna have to
write you up.

01:28:41.681 --> 01:28:43.850
It's the monster!

01:28:48.454 --> 01:28:50.390
- Have a good day, kid.
- Thanks.

01:29:00.734 --> 01:29:01.703
You guys ready for this?

01:29:02.101 --> 01:29:03.000
You know it.

01:29:03.002 --> 01:29:04.404
Hands in.

01:29:12.813 --> 01:29:14.548
Monster Busters!
