SWITCHES TV OFF
Lucky bastards.

01:42.119 --> 01:43.999
Who?
You didn't hear?

01:43.999 --> 01:46.039
Five workers at Jumbo Mart won
the lottery.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.439
$90 million.

01:47.439 --> 01:49.999
That's $18 million apiece before
taxes, the lucky bastards.

01:49.999 --> 01:51.519
I heard they all quit
their jobs.

01:51.519 --> 01:52.759
Can you blame them?

01:52.759 --> 01:55.319
No, but there was something
about starting my shift

01:55.319 --> 01:56.799
with a coffee, a Slim Jim

01:56.799 --> 01:59.199
and a smile from Babu
behind the register.

01:59.199 --> 02:00.759
Frank, where's
Dr Banfield?

02:00.759 --> 02:02.679
I need her to sign
the December QI reports.

02:02.679 --> 02:05.159
She's and the other
muckety-mucks are at
a department chairs meeting.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.359
She's leaving at two o'clock.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.719
Two?! That's mid-shift.

02:08.719 --> 02:10.598
Boss lady never leaves early.
What gives?

02:10.598 --> 02:12.519
FRANK:
I'm not her
social secretary.

02:12.519 --> 02:13.439
Minivans?
Mm-hm.

02:13.439 --> 02:14.399
Seriously?

02:14.399 --> 02:15.879
If I drive it,
they will come.

02:15.879 --> 02:16.879
Who will come?

02:16.879 --> 02:19.279
My future wife, kids
and our dog Buster.

02:19.279 --> 02:20.439
You already named
the dog?

02:20.439 --> 02:22.399
Yeah, I'm putting it out
there to the universe.

02:22.399 --> 02:24.399
I always dreamed of a house
in the 'burbs

02:24.399 --> 02:25.719
with a picket fence,
big backyard.

02:25.719 --> 02:27.039
Why tie yourself down?

02:27.039 --> 02:29.119
You got it all.
A great job, money,

02:29.119 --> 02:30.959
not to mention
that cool motorcycle.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.279
No wife is gonna let you ride
that thing, trust me.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.719
You know what
you're having?
a "thrisis."

02:35.719 --> 02:36.879
A what?

02:36.879 --> 02:38.999
A midlife crisis
for thirtysomethings.

02:38.999 --> 02:40.839
Are you looking
at your life,

02:40.839 --> 02:41.839
wondering what
it's all about?

02:41.839 --> 02:43.079
Yeah.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.439
Questioning your values
and what you're doing?

02:45.439 --> 02:46.719
Totally.

02:46.719 --> 02:49.919
You gals watch
too much Oprah.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.199
Auto versus bicycle,
three minutes out.

02:52.199 --> 02:54.439
OK, how do you spell
"thrisis"?

02:56.559 --> 02:59.038
Jody Nugent, 16, hit by a car
while on her bike.

02:59.038 --> 02:59.998
Wearing a helmet?

02:59.998 --> 03:01.158
Where's my stuff?

03:01.158 --> 03:02.838
Repetitive questioning,
abdominal pain,

03:02.838 --> 03:03.758
shoulder contusion
and forearm lac.

03:03.758 --> 03:04.878
How fast was the car going?

03:04.878 --> 03:05.998
Don't know.
My bag?
Where's my bag?

03:05.998 --> 03:07.558
Happened on Halstead.
Speed limit's 30.

03:07.558 --> 03:09.398
Like drivers obey the signs.
My bag!

03:09.398 --> 03:11.238
I need my bag!
Do you know where it is?

03:11.238 --> 03:13.318
Must have left it
on the rig.
Can you get it? I need it.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.758
Don't worry.
I'll go get
it right now.

03:14.758 --> 03:15.878
Get the scanner ready -
trauma one.

03:15.878 --> 03:17.238
Hey, do you need me
on this?

03:17.238 --> 03:18.718
No, no, we're good.
How about me?

03:18.718 --> 03:20.998
Join us when you get in.

03:20.998 --> 03:23.838
Hey.
Hi.

03:23.838 --> 03:25.358
Listen, about
the other night,

03:25.358 --> 03:26.478
I should apologise.

03:26.478 --> 03:27.438
For what?

03:27.438 --> 03:28.678
I was drinking...

03:28.678 --> 03:30.438
I was drunk, and if
I did anything...

03:30.438 --> 03:31.798
Tony, we had sex.

03:31.798 --> 03:33.318
So I did something.

03:33.318 --> 03:35.198
Mm-hm.
I had a good time.

03:35.198 --> 03:37.758
From what I remember,
I did, too.

03:37.758 --> 03:40.438
Oh, and then you asked me
to marry you.

03:40.438 --> 03:42.318
SHE LAUGHS
Kidding.

03:42.318 --> 03:43.638
Ah. So, we're cool?

03:43.638 --> 03:44.838
Yes, we're cool.

03:44.838 --> 03:46.518
Good, because
sometimes people

03:46.518 --> 03:48.678
in this kind
of situation

03:48.678 --> 03:50.358
get weird and things

03:50.358 --> 03:51.318
get messy and...

03:51.318 --> 03:52.918
You mean Sam?

03:52.918 --> 03:53.918
GATES:
And work.

03:53.918 --> 03:55.278
DARIA:
I got it. No drama.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.158
GATES:
Good.

04:07.838 --> 04:09.118
I don't see any rash.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.598
Look at the base
of the hairs.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.318
I see these
little white things.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.598
Something's moving.

04:13.598 --> 04:15.198
Moving?
He's got lice.

04:15.198 --> 04:18.678
Uh, we could treat
with permethrin?

04:18.678 --> 04:20.238
No, that's not good enough.
We gotta get rid
of all the nits.

04:20.238 --> 04:21.757
How? Pick 'em off?

04:21.757 --> 04:22.878
He's got to be shaved.

04:22.878 --> 04:24.158
How am I supposed
to shave my own back?

04:24.158 --> 04:25.838
Don't worry,
Dr Martin will do it for you.

04:25.838 --> 04:27.318
I will?

04:27.318 --> 04:29.838
Mm-hm. Get a prep razor
and a can of -

04:29.838 --> 04:31.118
two cans -
of shaving cream.

04:31.118 --> 04:33.038
Relax, buddy; don't
scratch so much.

04:33.038 --> 04:34.237
Dawn, you got this, right?

04:34.237 --> 04:36.997
Oh, hell no!

04:36.997 --> 04:38.197
DUMAR:
I got one over here.

04:38.197 --> 04:39.237
What do you got?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.237
Barbara Feingold.

04:40.237 --> 04:42.157
Ground-level fall,
good vitals,

04:42.157 --> 04:43.717
chest wall pain
on the left.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.197
I'm Dr Gates.
You have any pain?

04:45.197 --> 04:46.517
When I breathe.

04:46.517 --> 04:49.797
She hit the edge
of the bathtub. Ow!
Are you OK?

04:49.797 --> 04:52.357
Strained my back
trying to pick her up.
Too much dead weight.

04:52.357 --> 04:53.797
Did you just call me fat?

04:53.797 --> 04:55.917
Get a chest X-ray,
CBC and a pulse ox.

04:55.917 --> 04:56.877
Didn't call you fat.

04:56.877 --> 04:58.157
I'm still a size 8.

04:58.157 --> 04:59.717
If you're using
the metric system.

04:59.717 --> 05:02.357
I just want to thank you
so much for everything
you've done.

05:02.357 --> 05:04.277
No need; I'm just glad
we avoided surgery.

05:04.277 --> 05:06.197
You're not the only one.

05:06.197 --> 05:09.437
Hey, I'm, er...thank you
for sorting my phone out.

05:09.437 --> 05:11.557
I told you it was easy.

05:11.557 --> 05:13.757
Hey, no offence,
but I don't want

05:13.757 --> 05:16.517
to see you in here again
anytime soon, OK?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.837
Hi, Dr Brenner.

05:18.837 --> 05:21.117
I hope you had fun
in Australia.

05:21.117 --> 05:23.997
Thanks.

05:23.997 --> 05:25.917
Do I know her?

05:25.917 --> 05:26.917
Back from your holidays?

05:26.917 --> 05:27.957
Yeah, three days ago.

05:27.957 --> 05:30.157
I... I called you when
I first got back,

05:30.157 --> 05:32.117
and I thought we could
just go out

05:32.117 --> 05:33.597
and have some dinner
and catch up.

05:33.597 --> 05:34.797
Yeah, sorry, I was busy.

05:34.797 --> 05:36.957
Frank, is the PNB
back on exam two?

05:36.957 --> 05:38.157
I mean, the BNP?
Right here.

05:38.157 --> 05:40.517
I got you a souvenir.
It's in my locker.

05:40.517 --> 05:42.757
You didn't have to go to any
special bother for me.

05:42.757 --> 05:44.117
He didn't; he got
something for everybody.

05:44.117 --> 05:45.397
Watch this.

05:45.397 --> 05:47.597
Dr Brenner, can you help me out
with a vadge bleed?

05:47.597 --> 05:49.957
Yeah. Did you get
a narc on it? ..Yeah.

05:49.957 --> 05:51.957
BANFIELD:
Welcome back, Dr Brenner.

05:51.957 --> 05:53.757
Thank you.
Uh, it's good to be here.

05:53.757 --> 05:55.837
Yeah. Put it away,
Crocodile Dundee.

05:55.837 --> 05:58.877
Uh, Neela, have you heard
anything from Hopkins?

05:58.877 --> 06:01.717
Uh, not yet, but thanks
for putting in the call.

06:01.717 --> 06:04.957
Yeah, well, chief of surgery was
a med school classmate.

06:04.957 --> 06:07.197
I understand you're also
interviewing at Yale and Duke.

06:07.197 --> 06:08.197
Yeah, that's right.

06:08.197 --> 06:09.597
Yeah, well,
all good choices.

06:09.597 --> 06:13.276
Frank, I will be unreachable
for the rest of the day.

06:13.276 --> 06:16.756
Dr Banfield, um,
is everything OK?

06:16.756 --> 06:18.276
Yes. Why?

06:18.276 --> 06:19.996
I-I don't know. I just...

06:19.996 --> 06:20.956
I'm fine.

06:20.956 --> 06:22.516
Yeah, everything's fine.

06:26.316 --> 06:27.836
I guess my bike
skidded on some ice.

06:27.836 --> 06:29.756
Kind of cold
to be biking anywhere.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.116
Still need a pulse ox.

06:31.116 --> 06:32.436
Not getting any good waves.

06:32.436 --> 06:34.396
Ah! A finger probe is loose.
There you go.

06:34.396 --> 06:35.476
Thank you.

06:35.476 --> 06:36.596
RINGTONE PLAYING:
I should get that.

06:36.596 --> 06:37.516
Five-centimetre
forearm lac.

06:37.516 --> 06:38.836
Distal neuro-circ intact.

06:38.836 --> 06:41.676
Pupils equal and reactive.

06:41.676 --> 06:43.076
Can I get that?

06:43.076 --> 06:44.356
What labs
do you want?

06:44.356 --> 06:46.476
Uh, trauma panel,
ETOH levels, cam seven...

06:46.476 --> 06:47.556
Dr Morris?

06:47.556 --> 06:48.956
What she said
and a urine tox.

06:48.956 --> 06:50.716
Sam, I can do the foley,
if you want.

06:50.716 --> 06:52.916
She's not gonna need it once
she gets off the backboard.

06:52.916 --> 06:54.676
Is this our driver?
Not exactly.

06:54.676 --> 06:56.436
She was on a bicycle.
I don't have my licence yet.

06:56.436 --> 06:58.796
I thought they said MVC.
How's the belly?

06:58.796 --> 07:00.076
Some pressure
over the liver.

07:00.076 --> 07:01.516
RASGOTRA:
OK, I'll take
the ultrasound.

07:01.516 --> 07:04.836
Hey, Morris, the driver
of the car that hit
your patient is here.

07:04.836 --> 07:06.276
Alert - open fibula fracture
in curtain two.

07:06.276 --> 07:08.236
How is he? Is he OK?
The guy hit you.

07:08.236 --> 07:09.836
RINGTONE PLAYING:
He's the one
that should be worried.

07:09.836 --> 07:11.676
OK, er, whose phone
is that?

07:11.676 --> 07:12.916
It's mine.
I should answer it.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.036
Don't worry. We already
called your parents.

07:14.036 --> 07:16.116
Why did you do that?!
I don't want them here.

07:16.116 --> 07:17.516
Archie, please.

07:17.516 --> 07:18.916
That's my boyfriend!
That's his ring!

07:18.916 --> 07:20.436
MORRIS:
You can call him later.

07:20.436 --> 07:23.236
Let's get her upstairs
for a head and belly CT.

07:23.236 --> 07:24.916
Sam, curtain two when
you're done.

07:24.916 --> 07:26.476
Sure.

07:26.476 --> 07:27.676
Ultrasound looks good.

07:36.756 --> 07:39.036
You need help?

07:39.036 --> 07:40.196
Labelling the bloods?

07:40.196 --> 07:41.236
Yeah.

07:41.236 --> 07:43.076
How's anaesthetist
training going?

07:43.076 --> 07:44.156
Fine.

07:44.156 --> 07:45.516
It's really cool that
you're doing that.

07:45.516 --> 07:46.876
Uh-huh.

07:46.876 --> 07:49.156
The word is you're
really kicking ass
up in the OR.

07:49.156 --> 07:51.075
Yeah, it's great.
That's really great.

07:51.075 --> 07:52.995
Yeah. It must be really tough
juggling every...

07:52.995 --> 07:56.075
You want to help me, Daria?

07:56.075 --> 08:00.035
Would you see that these get
to the lab?

08:00.035 --> 08:01.715
I gotta help Dr Morris.

08:04.075 --> 08:04.955
Deep breath,
Mrs Feingold.

08:04.955 --> 08:05.955
I can't. It hurts.

08:05.955 --> 08:07.555
All right, titrate four
of morphine.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.115
This the fall?

08:09.115 --> 08:10.795
She slipped getting
out of the tub.

08:10.795 --> 08:12.875
I grabbed the towel bar,
but it was loose.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.875
Someone didn't fix it
like he promised.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.675
I told you
to call the super.

08:16.675 --> 08:18.195
That's what he
gets paid for.

08:18.195 --> 08:20.515
Blunt left chest
with dyspnoea.

08:20.515 --> 08:22.835
Well, it was a good thing
you were there to help.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.995
I wasn't exactly there.

08:23.995 --> 08:26.555
All right, so tell me,
where does it hurt?

08:26.555 --> 08:28.075
Here?
Ow!

08:28.075 --> 08:29.435
No crepitus.

08:29.435 --> 08:30.875
Harry lives in the apartment
next door.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.034
He heard me
yelling for help.

08:32.034 --> 08:33.395
Not hard not to hear.

08:33.395 --> 08:35.275
She's got a voice that
cuts through steel.

08:35.275 --> 08:36.434
Took your damn sweet time!

08:36.434 --> 08:38.155
CHUNY:
I thought you two
were married.

08:38.155 --> 08:39.115
Divorced.

08:39.115 --> 08:40.075
Three times.

08:40.075 --> 08:41.155
What? You've been married

08:41.155 --> 08:43.475
and divorced three times
to each other?

08:43.475 --> 08:44.875
What can I tell ya?

08:44.875 --> 08:46.395
I'm a glutton
for punishment.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.555
All right, any pain
in the stomach?

08:48.555 --> 08:49.995
Not really.

08:49.995 --> 08:53.075
But I do have a pain in my ass,
and he's standing two feet away.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.675
Hey, Chuny,

08:54.675 --> 08:55.995
you got any Ancef?

08:55.995 --> 08:57.355
Yeah. Try the cart,
first drawer.

08:57.355 --> 09:00.755
Hey. How's Alex?

09:00.755 --> 09:02.715
Good. It's getting
better every day.

09:02.715 --> 09:03.875
That's great to know.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.835
Yep, it is.

09:05.835 --> 09:06.995
MARQUEZ:
Hemocue 12.9.

09:06.995 --> 09:08.875
OK, call X-ray,
see if they're free.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.195
Any of you married?

09:10.195 --> 09:11.275
No.

09:11.275 --> 09:12.475
Never.
Not yet.

09:12.475 --> 09:13.675
Someday.

09:13.675 --> 09:15.435
What are you,
a bunch of losers?

09:15.435 --> 09:16.755
Now, with all due respect,

09:16.755 --> 09:18.355
you've been divorced
three times.

09:18.355 --> 09:20.275
It's complicated.
Ow!

09:20.275 --> 09:21.315
All right, Mr Feingold,

09:21.315 --> 09:22.755
let me check you out.

09:22.755 --> 09:24.635
I am fine. I'm fine.
X-ray's ready
to take her.

09:24.635 --> 09:26.755
OK, she'll gonna be upstairs
for a while.

09:26.755 --> 09:27.754
So now's a good time.

09:27.754 --> 09:28.874
Stop playing the martyr.

09:28.874 --> 09:29.994
Go to the doctor,
already.

09:29.994 --> 09:32.514
You see that?
she still bosses me around.

09:32.514 --> 09:34.034
Hollers - that's
her middle name.

09:34.034 --> 09:36.354
Holler! Holler!
Holler! Holler.

09:36.354 --> 09:37.714
Call me with the lactate.
Thanks.

09:37.714 --> 09:39.754
Well, if it isn't Chicago's
latest millionaire.

09:39.754 --> 09:41.474
Hi. Yes, yes, hi, Frank.

09:41.474 --> 09:42.554
Babu, congratulations.

09:42.554 --> 09:44.114
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

09:44.114 --> 09:45.234
A heart attack?

09:45.234 --> 09:46.914
Yeah, my heart is going
boom-boom-boom-boom...

09:46.914 --> 09:48.794
Are you having any
shortness of breath,

09:48.794 --> 09:51.314
pain radiating down your arm,
tightness in your chest?

09:51.314 --> 09:53.194
Oh, no, no, no,
nothing like that.

09:53.194 --> 09:54.794
OK, when did it start?

09:54.794 --> 09:58.394
Just now, when the lottery
people handed me the cheque.

09:58.394 --> 10:00.594
And it was a very big cheque.

10:00.594 --> 10:02.354
Oh, Dr Grady,
Daria needs help

10:02.354 --> 10:03.474
suturing bike girl
in Trauma One.

10:03.474 --> 10:04.874
I'll be right there.

10:04.874 --> 10:08.234
I think you're excited
and your adrenaline's kicked in,

10:08.234 --> 10:09.954
making your heart beat fast.

10:09.954 --> 10:13.794
So...I'll be OK?

10:13.794 --> 10:16.514
It's a big day. Enjoy it.

10:16.514 --> 10:19.314
Thank you, Dr Grady.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.554
Hey, come by later.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.754
Doughnuts are free all day.

10:22.754 --> 10:26.314
I'm taking my break now.
Babs, wait up!

10:26.314 --> 10:30.074
OK, you've got four
healthy-looking follicles here.

10:30.074 --> 10:31.914
Only four?
Only takes one.

10:31.914 --> 10:33.194
Right you are.

10:33.194 --> 10:36.994
OK, I don't know if Cate has
explained all of this to you,

10:36.994 --> 10:38.954
but using ultrasound guidance,

10:38.954 --> 10:41.954
I am going to aspirate the fluid
from each of those follicles,

10:41.954 --> 10:44.394
and then our embryologists will

10:44.394 --> 10:46.354
isolate the eggs
for fertilization.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.874
All right, let's get
this over with.

10:48.874 --> 10:50.434
She's going to be out
for this, right?

10:50.434 --> 10:51.914
Well, that's up to you.

10:51.914 --> 10:53.834
Knock me out.
I want to be totally out.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.034
SHE CHUCKLES
All right.

10:55.034 --> 10:56.274
Do you have any
other questions?

10:56.274 --> 10:57.714
No.

10:57.714 --> 11:00.914
You want some Valium,
so you can relax a bit?

11:00.914 --> 11:03.873
No.
I do.

11:03.873 --> 11:06.153
SHE CHUCKLES

11:06.153 --> 11:07.633
We'll get started shortly.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.713
OK.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.113
The labs on your
bicycle girl.

11:12.113 --> 11:15.513
Here's a shocker: no drugs
or alcohol in her system.

11:15.513 --> 11:16.953
Are her parents on
their way in?

11:16.953 --> 11:17.873
They're over in
Rogers Park

11:17.873 --> 11:18.913
with traffic
that'll be awhile.

11:18.913 --> 11:20.993
Frank, you don't
have lice.

11:20.993 --> 11:22.753
They can't pole-vault over
from curtain three.

11:22.753 --> 11:25.273
I need some help.
What's up?

11:25.273 --> 11:27.673
The driver who hit Jody,

11:27.673 --> 11:28.793
I gave him Ancef.
Yeah, and...?

11:28.793 --> 11:29.233
I think he's having
an allergic reaction.

11:29.233 --> 11:31.913
Diffuse urticaria.
Are you having
trouble breathing?

11:31.913 --> 11:32.873
A little.

11:32.873 --> 11:34.113
BP - 85/60.

11:34.113 --> 11:35.593
Ever been allergic
to medicines before?

11:35.593 --> 11:37.313
JODY: Let go of me!
GRADY: Jody, you need to calm down.

11:37.313 --> 11:38.713
I want my phone!

11:38.713 --> 11:40.273
Give me my phone!
What the hell's
going in there?

11:40.273 --> 11:42.073
You have to stay still.
I want my phone!

11:42.073 --> 11:44.473
OK, point-three epi sub-cu
50 diphenhydramine,

11:44.473 --> 11:48.873
125 of solumedrol, and five of
albuterol if his lungs don't clear.

11:48.873 --> 11:51.153
I got it all right here.
Be right back.

11:51.153 --> 11:53.633
You have
to stay still...
Guys, what's going on?

11:53.633 --> 11:55.273
What's going on?
We're trying to suture
the forearm lac.

11:55.273 --> 11:56.193
RINGTONE PLAYING:
Give it to me!

11:56.193 --> 11:58.633
She will not sit still!
Get off me!

11:58.633 --> 12:00.233
RINGTONE PLAYING:
You said I could
have it later!

12:00.233 --> 12:01.953
Grady, curtain two, go!

12:01.953 --> 12:03.793
Jody, stop it, OK?
we don't have time
for this nonsense!

12:03.793 --> 12:05.273
Get off of me! Let me go!

12:05.273 --> 12:07.153
Daria, two of versed,
soft restraint.

12:07.153 --> 12:09.833
It's mine! I want it now!

12:09.833 --> 12:11.593
Oh! God!
Are you OK?

12:11.593 --> 12:12.473
God!

12:12.473 --> 12:15.073
Hi. Hi.

12:15.073 --> 12:16.393
I'm sorry. I know.

12:16.393 --> 12:19.033
I'm OK.

12:19.033 --> 12:20.273
Ow...
SHE GROANS

12:20.273 --> 12:22.313
I love you.

14:39.431 --> 14:43.071
We know how it feels
to take pride in a job.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.391
Our decking, for example, is
sourced from Northern Scandinavia.

14:47.911 --> 14:50.031
We insist on timber
which has been slow grown...

14:50.711 --> 14:52.391
..for at least 80 years.

14:53.271 --> 14:56.631
Which means it's less
inclined to split, or twist.

14:58.111 --> 15:00.911
That's why we're proud
to put our name on it.

15:00.991 --> 15:03.431
Slow-grown timber decking.

15:38.551 --> 15:41.311
Mum, I want to do a poo.
Come on, then

15:41.311 --> 15:44.191
But I want to do a poo
in Paul's Bathroom.

15:44.191 --> 15:48.071
Don't be silly. Come on.
I'm going to do a poo at Paul's.

15:48.071 --> 15:51.431
Paul's bathroom
has Glade Touch 'n Fresh

15:51.431 --> 15:52.870
More discreet than an aerosol,

15:52.870 --> 15:55.710
it's no more bad smells,
just a pleasant fragrance

15:58.470 --> 16:00.510
Great value from
your fishmonger at Morrisons -

16:00.630 --> 16:02.230
save one third on
fresh cod fillets.

16:39.670 --> 16:40.630
SHE GROANS

16:40.630 --> 16:42.110
Thank you, Sam.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.110
The girl totally
freaked out.

16:44.110 --> 16:45.430
Happens.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.790
Over a cell phone?

16:46.790 --> 16:49.670
My fault - I should learn
to duck, right?

16:49.670 --> 16:52.350
Wouldn't hurt.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.470
You think this is
gonna leave a mark?

16:55.510 --> 16:57.550
No, not at all.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.110
SHE GROANS

16:59.110 --> 17:00.950
Thanks for doing this.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.470
Yeah, you already
said that.

17:02.470 --> 17:04.990
Yeah, but, I mean, I-I know
how busy you nurses are.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.790
You know, the last
thing you need

17:06.790 --> 17:08.829
is a doctor
as a patient.

17:08.950 --> 17:10.430
You know what, Daria?

17:10.430 --> 17:11.390
What?

17:11.390 --> 17:13.869
Can I ask you something?

17:13.869 --> 17:15.349
It's kind of awkward.

17:15.349 --> 17:16.430
OK.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.190
Are you seeing somebody?

17:19.190 --> 17:20.069
No.

17:21.150 --> 17:22.869
Huh!

17:22.869 --> 17:25.790
Wow, I could've sworn
that you were.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.750
You have that glow.

17:29.429 --> 17:32.989
Anyway, there's this guy
who works in the hospital,

17:32.989 --> 17:36.229
and I think the two of you
would really hit it off.
Oh, no...it's...

17:36.229 --> 17:38.349
it's so nice
of you, but...
Oh, he's really cool.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.629
I'm gonna give him
your number. I am.

17:40.629 --> 17:42.789
You know, as long as you're
free and everything.

17:42.909 --> 17:45.269
Can I think about it?

17:45.269 --> 17:47.429
Sure, sure.
But don't wait too long.

17:47.429 --> 17:49.789
You don't want
to change your mind.

17:49.789 --> 17:52.269
MORRIS:
We were only trying
to help you.

17:52.269 --> 17:54.029
I... I got scared.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.269
I mean...

17:55.269 --> 17:57.149
I don't like being here,

17:57.149 --> 17:59.069
and then I saw
the driver, and...

17:59.069 --> 18:01.709
I guess I just
freaked out.

18:01.709 --> 18:02.909
I'm so sorry.

18:04.669 --> 18:06.509
We're finished here.

18:06.509 --> 18:08.389
I'll get the sling
for your arm.

18:08.389 --> 18:09.669
Is the driver still here?

18:09.669 --> 18:11.469
We're keeping an eye
on him upstairs.

18:11.469 --> 18:13.549
Is he gonna be OK?
He should be.

18:13.549 --> 18:14.869
Dr Morris,
the girl's boyfriend.

18:14.869 --> 18:16.349
I couldn't get him to wait.

18:16.349 --> 18:18.069
Oh, it's OK, Frank.

18:18.069 --> 18:20.269
Hey, baby,
you OK?
Mm-hm.

18:20.269 --> 18:22.949
I didn't know where you were -
I was so worried

18:22.949 --> 18:24.749
when you didn't answer
my calls, my texts.

18:24.749 --> 18:26.709
Her phone was getting
quite a workout.

18:26.709 --> 18:28.269
I guess that was you.

18:28.269 --> 18:30.429
Yeah. Hi.
Tommy Cole.
Dr Morris.

18:30.429 --> 18:32.549
What were you doing
on a bike?

18:32.549 --> 18:34.949
I could give you a ride
anywhere you want, anytime.

18:34.949 --> 18:36.389
I didn't want
to bother you.

18:36.389 --> 18:38.389
Baby, you could
never do that.

18:38.389 --> 18:40.589
She gonna be OK?

18:40.589 --> 18:42.389
Well, could've been worse.

18:42.389 --> 18:46.109
I'm a little thirsty -
can I get something to drink?

18:46.109 --> 18:48.109
Is it OK if I
get her a pop?

18:48.109 --> 18:49.829
Cafeteria's
on the third floor.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.269
OK. I'll be right back.

18:54.269 --> 18:56.869
You take off your bracelet?

18:56.869 --> 18:59.309
Um...

18:59.309 --> 19:00.589
No, they...

19:00.589 --> 19:01.829
MORRIS:
It probably...

19:01.829 --> 19:03.389
it came off
when she got hit.

19:03.389 --> 19:05.788
Oh, well,
I'll get you another one.

19:05.788 --> 19:07.908
Or maybe I should
buy a dozen, huh?

19:07.908 --> 19:09.908
My klutzy girl.

19:16.228 --> 19:18.108
Seems like a nice guy.

19:19.788 --> 19:21.788
Yeah. He's the best.

19:21.788 --> 19:23.228
I'm really lucky.

19:23.228 --> 19:24.668
GATES:
Any pain right on the bone?

19:24.668 --> 19:25.988
Not so bad.

19:25.988 --> 19:27.588
How about here
on the sides?

19:27.588 --> 19:28.908
HE GRUNTS IN PAIN

19:28.908 --> 19:29.868
Bingo.

19:30.948 --> 19:33.828
Valentine's Day, 1959.

19:33.828 --> 19:36.228
50 years ago next month.

19:36.228 --> 19:38.588
Barbara and I got married
for the first time.

19:38.588 --> 19:40.148
She was a looker.

19:40.148 --> 19:42.428
I don't know what
she saw in me.

19:42.428 --> 19:44.308
Kind of unusual
marrying and divorcing

19:44.308 --> 19:45.788
the same woman over and over...

19:45.788 --> 19:46.988
and over.

19:46.988 --> 19:50.628
Well, it takes a lot
of passion to keep making up

19:50.628 --> 19:53.588
and breaking up
and making up and...
I'll bet.

19:53.588 --> 19:55.908
So, er, what's with you

19:55.908 --> 19:58.948
and this pretty nurse you
were trying to make nice with?

19:58.948 --> 20:00.428
Sam. Yeah.

20:00.428 --> 20:02.148
We were together, but, er,

20:02.148 --> 20:04.988
it's been over a while now -
seven weeks.

20:04.988 --> 20:06.708
You sure?

20:07.788 --> 20:09.908
You're still counting weeks.

20:09.908 --> 20:11.508
BARBARA:
I spent half a century

20:11.508 --> 20:12.748
with Harry Feingold.

20:12.748 --> 20:15.428
What's four weeks of rib
pain compared to that?

20:15.428 --> 20:17.588
And you kept
taking him back?

20:17.588 --> 20:19.548
The heart wants
what the heart wants -

20:19.548 --> 20:21.868
even though your head
screams, "Don't do it!"

20:21.868 --> 20:23.348
You girls must know
what I mean.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.228
Kind of.

20:25.228 --> 20:26.388
HARRY:
Stubborn,

20:26.388 --> 20:28.548
hot-headed, and
she has this way

20:28.548 --> 20:31.588
of pushing
all my buttons.
Yeah. I know the kind.

20:31.588 --> 20:34.388
Though I must admit,

20:34.388 --> 20:37.868
I have made my
share of mistakes.

20:37.868 --> 20:39.308
BARBARA:
I caught him
with his secretary.

20:39.308 --> 20:41.068
Such a cliche.

20:41.068 --> 20:43.027
I'd stopped by
his office one day,

20:43.027 --> 20:45.227
and the way she handed
him his coffee...

20:45.227 --> 20:48.467
at that moment, I knew. I just knew.

20:48.467 --> 20:51.267
The problem is,
I can't live without her.

20:51.267 --> 20:54.147
But the problem with that is,
I can't live with her, either.

20:54.147 --> 20:57.627
So, this is it, we are done.

20:57.627 --> 20:58.987
Sometimes it's impossible

20:58.987 --> 21:01.747
for two people who love
each other to be together.

21:01.747 --> 21:03.707
This is it.

21:03.707 --> 21:05.347
We're done for good.

21:06.587 --> 21:08.307
I keep trying
to get it right,

21:08.307 --> 21:10.907
but I keep
screwing it up.

21:10.907 --> 21:13.347
You want my advice, >

21:13.347 --> 21:16.267
to avoid 50 years of agita?

21:16.267 --> 21:18.187
Walk away.

21:20.587 --> 21:23.107
CT results
on Morris's bike girl.

21:23.107 --> 21:26.147
Alex, I heard you.
Four days at Sugarbush.

21:26.147 --> 21:29.067
Cos I'm not sure I want
you shushing down mountains

21:29.067 --> 21:31.867
after all you've
been through.

21:31.867 --> 21:34.827
I'll be home later,
you can argue with me then.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.187
Bye.

21:36.187 --> 21:39.867
Alex wants to go snowboarding?
Sorry. Hard not to overhear.

21:39.867 --> 21:41.507
A school trip - he's not gonna go.

21:41.507 --> 21:44.267
Hey, do you have a minute?
I was hoping we could talk.

21:44.267 --> 21:47.347
Uh, I can't right now -
maybe, er, maybe later.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.067
Hey. Simon, thank you so much

21:49.067 --> 21:51.987
for that boomerang -
Alex is gonna love it.
Thought he might.

21:51.987 --> 21:53.707
Hey, er, how's Mr Feingold?

21:53.707 --> 21:54.907
Muscle strain.

21:54.907 --> 21:56.907
He's back in two
bickering with his ex.

21:56.907 --> 21:58.627
That is one strange pair.

21:58.627 --> 22:00.267
Please, Malik -
you're my last hope.

22:00.267 --> 22:01.507
No way, no how.
Last hope for what?

22:01.507 --> 22:03.787
To shave hairy-lice guy.
He's still here?

22:03.787 --> 22:05.827
Come on, Dawn,
you've seen worse.

22:05.827 --> 22:08.827
The thought of touching him
makes my skin crawl.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.947
Grady, shave
hairy-lice guy.

22:10.947 --> 22:12.827
WHISPERS:
Yes!
But he's not my patient.

22:12.827 --> 22:13.987
He is now.

22:13.987 --> 22:15.347
This is so unfair.

22:15.347 --> 22:16.667
CHUCKLES >

22:16.667 --> 22:18.106
What's his problem?

22:18.106 --> 22:19.426
Lice.
Oh, lovely.

22:19.426 --> 22:20.906
Is my abdominal series
back on decker?

22:20.906 --> 22:23.586
Do you realise that if you
were still at Jumbo Mart

22:23.586 --> 22:26.946
you'd be a millionaire right now.
You worked at the Jumbo Mart?

22:26.946 --> 22:28.906
Uh, yeah,
a few years ago.

22:28.906 --> 22:30.386
I was sorting things out,

22:30.386 --> 22:32.466
wanted to make sure
medicine was right for me.

22:32.466 --> 22:33.866
Thank God she came back.

22:33.866 --> 22:35.426
Mm. Thanks, frank,
that's sweet.

22:35.426 --> 22:37.066
You never made
the right change.

22:37.066 --> 22:40.506
You know, if I won the lottery,
this is the last place I'd be.

22:40.506 --> 22:42.986
You wouldn't stay here
for the work or the people?

22:42.986 --> 22:45.306
I'd be off travelling
around the world.

22:45.306 --> 22:48.266
First stop, the seven wonders
of the modern and ancient world.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.626
Mm-hmm.
And then, it's off
to a secluded island

22:50.626 --> 22:53.306
where you can stay in huts
right over the water.

22:53.306 --> 22:55.386
There is nothing like
being lulled to sleep

22:55.386 --> 22:56.506
by the sound of the sea.

22:56.506 --> 22:59.626
Well, personally, I think pyramids
are overrated, and I get seasick.

22:59.626 --> 23:01.946
Well, wh-what would
you do if you won?

23:01.946 --> 23:03.946
Invest in a high-yield
interest-bearing account

23:03.946 --> 23:05.786
at an Fdic-insured bank.

23:05.786 --> 23:08.186
Wow, that's really
thinking out of the box.

23:08.186 --> 23:10.506
Well, don't come crying
to me for a loan

23:10.506 --> 23:12.346
when you've blown
through your millions.

23:13.306 --> 23:15.026
Jody's CT results.
Thanks.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.386
Daria!

23:16.386 --> 23:18.786
Did you think about
what I asked you?
Not yet.

23:18.786 --> 23:20.506
Well, I hope you
don't hate me

23:20.506 --> 23:22.626
for this, but I gave
him your number.

23:22.626 --> 23:24.506
You did?

23:24.506 --> 23:27.506
Yeah, I just...have
a feeling about you two.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.026
Mm.

23:29.026 --> 23:30.786
Yep, he's gonna call.

23:35.226 --> 23:36.786
You OK?

23:38.866 --> 23:41.426
We're friends, so
I'm just gonna ask you.

23:43.626 --> 23:45.266
It's about Tony.

23:45.266 --> 23:46.826
Oh, yeah? What about him?

23:46.826 --> 23:49.586
I have a feeling that
he's dating someone else.

23:49.586 --> 23:52.026
Have you heard anything?

23:52.026 --> 23:53.346
Nothing.

23:53.346 --> 23:55.505
Oh, good.

23:55.505 --> 23:58.145
I mean, could you
imagine if it was

23:58.145 --> 24:01.505
somebody here at the hospital?
That would be too cruel.

24:01.505 --> 24:02.745
Right?

24:05.585 --> 24:08.465
Shut up and stop
touching me, Opie!

24:08.465 --> 24:10.705
Hello, Dr Morris. How you doing?

24:10.705 --> 24:12.385
Officer Diaz, look at you.

24:12.385 --> 24:14.185
Back in uniform.
Well, we caught
the big fish

24:14.185 --> 24:15.625
in that drug case
I was working.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.105
Congratulations.
Yeah.

24:17.105 --> 24:18.665
So it's back on the beat

24:18.665 --> 24:21.105
until I start
the detectives' academy.
Oh, great.

24:21.105 --> 24:22.865
So, maybe you can help me-
I'm taking statements

24:22.865 --> 24:24.345
in an auto-versus-
bicycle case.

24:24.345 --> 24:27.625
Yeah, on Halstead. I treated the
driver and the girl who got hit.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.905
I've been talking
to the driver upstairs,

24:28.905 --> 24:31.345
and I'd like to see the girl...
Jody Nugent, if I could.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.785
Sure. She's in trauma one.

24:32.785 --> 24:35.185
Come on.
You have any drugs
or alcohol involved?

24:35.185 --> 24:37.385
No. No, it sounds
like he was speeding,

24:37.385 --> 24:39.465
ran a light.
I don't think so.

24:39.465 --> 24:41.745
It doesn't look like
it was his fault.
Really?

24:41.745 --> 24:43.465
What, do you
think I'm stupid?
No, I...

24:43.465 --> 24:44.585
I know Matt Zullo

24:44.585 --> 24:45.665
lives near there!
Hey.

24:45.665 --> 24:47.305
Is there
a problem here?

24:47.305 --> 24:49.865
Oh, hi. No, we were just,
you know, talking.

24:49.865 --> 24:52.225
And you are...?
Uh, Tommy Cole, ma'am.

24:52.225 --> 24:53.865
My boyfriend.

24:53.865 --> 24:57.065
Well, all your
scans and test were good.

24:57.065 --> 24:59.865
Which means you can go home
as soon as your parents arrive.

24:59.865 --> 25:02.345
All right!
In the meantime,
this is Officer Diaz.

25:02.345 --> 25:05.585
She wants to ask you a few questions
about what happened today.

25:05.585 --> 25:08.225
I don't remember much.
That's OK. Tell me what you do.

25:08.225 --> 25:10.065
Yeah, just tell them
what happened.

25:10.065 --> 25:11.745
Actually, Tommy,
it would be best

25:11.745 --> 25:13.665
if you stepped
out of the room.

25:15.225 --> 25:18.305
But he's not leaving.

25:18.305 --> 25:20.985
Dr Morris is Jody's doctor,
and I invited him to stay.

25:23.865 --> 25:26.945
OK, yeah,
I'll be right outside.

25:36.464 --> 25:37.984
Well, it's like I said.

25:37.984 --> 25:40.584
I was riding my bike, and
I must have skidded on some ice.

25:40.584 --> 25:41.664
Sounds scary.

25:41.664 --> 25:43.784
Yeah.

25:45.704 --> 25:49.224
The driver said it seemed like you
deliberately rode into traffic.

25:49.224 --> 25:50.584
He's wrong.

25:50.584 --> 25:52.224
Two eyewitnesses
said you rode your bike

25:52.224 --> 25:54.104
into the middle of the street,
then stopped,

25:54.104 --> 25:56.464
and there was no way for the
driver to slow down in time.

25:56.464 --> 25:57.984
Is that true?

25:57.984 --> 26:00.024
No.
Maybe you were distracted? >

26:00.024 --> 26:01.304
Something on your mind?

26:01.304 --> 26:03.304
Having any problems
at home or school?

26:07.104 --> 26:08.784
Everything's good.

26:09.824 --> 26:11.824
How about with Tommy?

26:14.944 --> 26:16.744
MORRIS:
Jody...

26:16.744 --> 26:18.624
what really happened today?

26:18.624 --> 26:21.544
Were you trying
to hurt yourself?

26:21.544 --> 26:23.584
Hey, so you guys done or what?

26:25.784 --> 26:27.984
Yeah, we're done.

26:29.864 --> 26:32.984
So...you think we can
handle triplets?

26:34.304 --> 26:35.344
It's a non-issue.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.024
Twins, OK, but triplets?

26:37.024 --> 26:38.624
Even if all four follicles

26:38.624 --> 26:40.264
produce eggs,
the chance of three of them

26:40.264 --> 26:42.624
becoming high-grade embryos
is next to zero.

26:42.624 --> 26:45.304
One step at a time.
We've made it this far.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.304
Yeah, well,
this is the hard part.

26:47.304 --> 26:48.584
We have to be realistic.

26:48.584 --> 26:50.304
Who says I'm not?

26:50.304 --> 26:53.144
Don't be disappointed
if it doesn't work out.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.504
Of course I'll be disappointed.
But I'll be OK.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.864
Cate, what we have now,
especially these last few months,

26:59.864 --> 27:02.984
I already feel
pretty damn lucky.

27:02.984 --> 27:04.264
Sure you do.

27:04.264 --> 27:06.303
No,I'm serious. You and me...

27:06.303 --> 27:07.743
it's enough.

27:07.743 --> 27:10.343
You know that, right?

27:10.343 --> 27:12.983
So, you don't think
it's going to work out?

27:12.983 --> 27:14.143
I didn't say that.

27:14.143 --> 27:15.423
If you didn't want me
to do IVF,

27:15.423 --> 27:17.583
you should've said
something way before now.

27:17.583 --> 27:18.703
I can't win here.

27:18.703 --> 27:22.263
No... No, you can't.

27:25.783 --> 27:27.183
I'm sorry.

27:29.263 --> 27:31.503
Baby, I'm already rearranging
furniture in my mind,

27:31.503 --> 27:33.823
thinking about where
to put a crib, but you...

27:33.823 --> 27:36.543
you're the most
pragmatic person I know.

27:36.543 --> 27:38.823
So the fact
that we're here,

27:38.823 --> 27:41.183
in the face of all kind
of discouraging evidence,

27:41.183 --> 27:45.303
means that, deep down... you
believe we have a chance, too.

27:45.303 --> 27:49.183
I don't know what made me
think this could work.

27:49.183 --> 27:51.903
You don't have
to understand it.

27:51.903 --> 27:54.503
Just hold onto it.

27:58.983 --> 28:00.983
Triplets would kill us.

28:00.983 --> 28:03.183
You, not me.

28:03.623 --> 28:06.183
Jody's not telling
the whole story.

28:06.183 --> 28:07.823
And she probably won't
with her boyfriend around.

28:07.823 --> 28:10.903
Coffee? Can't vouch for
how long it's been sitting here.

28:10.903 --> 28:12.383
Sure.

28:12.383 --> 28:15.143
You know, maybe I should
go back in there, try again.

28:15.143 --> 28:17.943
Or maybe when Jody's parents
get here, she'll say-

28:17.943 --> 28:19.463
What? bad idea?

28:19.463 --> 28:21.143
When I was 16,
if there was something

28:21.143 --> 28:22.623
I didn't want
my parents to know...

28:22.623 --> 28:24.223
You exercised your right
to remain silent.

28:24.223 --> 28:27.383
My father says me interrogating
suspects as a detective

28:27.383 --> 28:28.663
will be karmic payback.

28:32.703 --> 28:34.583
You're getting
really good at that.

28:34.583 --> 28:35.903
Much better than
the other interns.

28:35.903 --> 28:37.103
Forget it.

28:37.103 --> 28:38.823
Hairy lice guy?

28:38.823 --> 28:40.783
Very lame trying
to butter me up.

28:40.783 --> 28:42.222
What? I wasn't doing that.

28:42.222 --> 28:43.742
It was pretty obvious.

28:43.742 --> 28:45.382
How am I gonna
get out of this?

28:45.382 --> 28:48.822
Oh, I don't know.
Be resourceful.

28:48.822 --> 28:50.742
Joey, let me help you
with that.

28:51.262 --> 28:52.542
This is so frustrating.

28:52.542 --> 28:54.022
Can't do much
if she won't talk.

28:54.022 --> 28:55.662
Maybe psych can
get it out of her.

28:55.662 --> 28:57.342
I'm sorry,
I have to roll.

28:57.342 --> 29:00.342
If anything changes
with Jody, call me.

29:00.342 --> 29:02.502
Or just call me.

29:02.502 --> 29:04.262
I will.
MR NUGENT:
Excuse me.

29:04.262 --> 29:05.662
We're here for our
daughter Jody Nugent.

29:05.662 --> 29:08.582
Dr Morris? There are Jody's parents.

29:08.582 --> 29:10.422
Oh, hi. I treated Jody.

29:10.422 --> 29:11.582
MRS NUGENT:
How is she?

29:11.582 --> 29:13.142
Well, she has a
separated shoulder

29:13.142 --> 29:14.542
and a minor concussion.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.382
But you should be
able to take her home,

29:16.382 --> 29:17.662
if our psychiatrist
clears her.

29:17.662 --> 29:19.102
Psychiatrist?

29:19.102 --> 29:21.102
I have some concerns
about what happened today.

29:21.102 --> 29:23.382
What kind of concerns?
Our daughter's not nuts.

29:23.382 --> 29:24.982
Honey, calm down.
No, I didn't say that.

29:24.982 --> 29:26.662
But her story
doesn't fit-

29:26.662 --> 29:29.542
Her story? Now she's a liar?
No, that's not what I'm saying.

29:29.542 --> 29:31.342
Now, look, our daughter
got hit by a car

29:31.342 --> 29:32.982
and we want to see her now.

29:32.982 --> 29:34.062
Of course.

29:40.342 --> 29:41.662
Hey.

29:45.822 --> 29:47.182
You want to talk?

29:47.182 --> 29:48.942
Yes.

29:51.062 --> 29:52.822
I've been thinking.

29:52.822 --> 29:54.582
I don't want
to give up on us.

29:54.582 --> 29:56.022
Tony...

29:56.022 --> 29:58.062
Sam, I don't want to be
one of those couples

29:58.062 --> 29:59.262
who never get it right,

29:59.262 --> 30:02.142
and they never work
through the tough times.

30:02.142 --> 30:03.782
I realise that we have
something worth saving.

30:03.782 --> 30:05.742
I'd be an idiot if I didn't try
to convince you of that.

30:05.742 --> 30:07.902
Did you realise that before

30:07.902 --> 30:10.622
or after you had sex with Daria?

30:17.862 --> 30:19.981
It was one time, Sam,

30:19.981 --> 30:22.421
and it didn't
feel right.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.021
It just...

30:24.021 --> 30:25.621
it made me miss you more.

30:25.621 --> 30:27.501
Oh, flattering, really.

30:27.501 --> 30:28.821
It was a mistake.

30:28.821 --> 30:30.741
Mm-mm.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.141
The mistake is thinking that

30:32.141 --> 30:35.021
we can put the past
behind us and start fresh.

30:35.021 --> 30:36.501
We can.
No! we can't!

30:36.501 --> 30:38.301
Because you're never going to change.
You just proved that.

30:38.301 --> 30:39.901
You're the one who
broke up with me, remember?

30:39.901 --> 30:41.181
You couldn't move out
of my place fast enough.

30:41.181 --> 30:42.501
Lucky for you I did.

30:42.501 --> 30:43.981
Sam, I told you, it didn't

30:43.981 --> 30:45.261
mean anything...
Tony...

30:45.261 --> 30:47.421
Sorry.
Oh, God.

30:47.421 --> 30:49.901
Don't. Don't be. We're done.

30:52.541 --> 30:55.221
He's all yours.

31:54.421 --> 31:55.581
# Wistful chime music

31:55.781 --> 31:59.300
It was when we got
back from our holiday in Turkey...

31:59.500 --> 32:03.420
..surprise, surprise,
it was raining when we got home.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.340
And then 'someone'
couldn't find the keys.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.180
My mum had been round
and she'd left us this box...

32:10.300 --> 32:12.660
..so, I put the kettle on.

32:14.980 --> 32:17.100
We've never been back to Turkey,

32:17.180 --> 32:19.780
but we've never drunk any other tea.

32:19.860 --> 32:21.820
Discover a brighter cup of tea.

32:24.460 --> 32:26.700
(old movie music)

32:35.060 --> 32:36.500
No!

32:36.500 --> 32:37.740
Don't do this!

32:37.740 --> 32:38.380
(whistle)

32:44.700 --> 32:46.820
Don't break up with your hair

OK, chase it

36:07.898 --> 36:11.498
I'm gonna need some saline
for the cervical wash.

36:11.498 --> 36:13.498
Ready?

36:13.498 --> 36:15.738
Ready.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.458
Starting the propofol infusion.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.298
How long before
we know something?

36:19.298 --> 36:20.698
Oh, by the time
she's waking up

36:20.698 --> 36:22.698
from the anaesthesia,
we'll be able to say

36:22.698 --> 36:25.298
how many eggs
we have to work with.

36:28.058 --> 36:29.578
If it's bad news,

36:29.578 --> 36:32.018
I want to hear it
from you, OK?

36:32.018 --> 36:34.618
It won't be bad news.

36:36.338 --> 36:38.138
Pressure's down to 70/30.

36:38.138 --> 36:39.418
GROANING

36:39.418 --> 36:40.978
Barb, doll, I'm here.

36:40.978 --> 36:42.138
What's wrong?

36:42.138 --> 36:43.738
I'm not sure. Spleen looks good.

36:43.738 --> 36:44.938
No tension pneumo.

36:44.938 --> 36:46.018
What happened?

36:46.018 --> 36:47.858
Hypotensive, we're not sure why.

36:47.858 --> 36:48.898
GATES:
You check the belly?

36:48.898 --> 36:49.977
Yeah, we already did.

36:49.977 --> 36:51.177
BRENNER:
No cardiac tamponade.

36:51.177 --> 36:52.417
TAGGART:
Think it's an MI?

36:52.417 --> 36:53.817
A heart attack?

36:53.817 --> 36:54.897
Could be. 12 lead Ekg.

36:54.897 --> 36:56.697
The o-neg's here. Should I hang it?

36:56.697 --> 36:58.497
No, start the dopamine.
She's not bleeding.

36:58.497 --> 37:00.337
Yes, she is.
There's an echo-free area

37:00.337 --> 37:02.057
posterior to the spleen.

37:02.057 --> 37:03.977
It's a haematoma you missed
from the anterior approach.

37:03.977 --> 37:05.417
Hang some blood,
prep for intubation.

37:05.417 --> 37:07.177
Surgery's here.

37:07.177 --> 37:08.297
HARRY:
She needs surgery?

37:08.297 --> 37:09.977
Her broken rib may have
ruptured her spleen.

37:09.977 --> 37:11.577
RASGOTRA:
Central line and
then the OR

37:11.577 --> 37:14.537
Push etomidate and sux.
That's a nice catch, Tony.

37:14.537 --> 37:16.337
Yeah, nice.

37:16.337 --> 37:18.177
All right, we're going
to give her some medicine

37:18.177 --> 37:21.697
so she'll go to sleep
while we put in a breathing tube.

37:21.697 --> 37:23.657
Don't leave me,
you hear?

37:23.657 --> 37:26.137
I'm sorry for everything.

37:26.137 --> 37:28.537
I need you.

37:28.537 --> 37:30.497
WHISPERING:
I love you.

37:31.577 --> 37:32.697
I know.

37:32.697 --> 37:34.417
Me, too, my love.

37:34.417 --> 37:36.137

Yankauer.

37:42.857 --> 37:44.257
So, Jody's leaving.

37:44.257 --> 37:45.777
What?!

37:45.777 --> 37:48.057
You cleared her medically
and Psych gave her the OK.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.217
Why didn't you find me?

37:49.217 --> 37:50.817
Her parents were anxious
to get her home.

37:50.817 --> 37:52.297
I didn't know what else to do.

37:52.297 --> 37:53.777
How about a nice hot bath?
That'll make everything better.

37:53.777 --> 37:56.817
You know, we might want
to keep Jody here overnight.

37:56.817 --> 37:58.217
You said she was OK to go.

37:58.217 --> 37:59.617
I was going to have
ortho see her,

37:59.617 --> 38:01.617
get her plugged in to physical
therapy for her shoulder.

38:01.617 --> 38:02.897
MRS NUGENT:
Is that necessary?

38:02.897 --> 38:04.457
It'll be more convenient
than having to come back.

38:04.457 --> 38:05.577
MR NUGENT:
We'd really like her

38:05.577 --> 38:08.217
home with us.
I understand.

38:08.217 --> 38:10.257
You'll have to sign discharge
papers at the front desk.

38:10.257 --> 38:13.417
I'm sorry you had to go
through this all alone.

38:13.417 --> 38:14.497
I was here.
When aren't you around?

38:14.497 --> 38:15.977
MRS NUGENT:
Yes, thank you for coming.

38:15.977 --> 38:18.417
Mr Nugent?
Yeah.

38:18.417 --> 38:19.857
Could I have a moment?

38:23.057 --> 38:25.497
I'm sorry, but I can't
help but think

38:25.497 --> 38:27.216
there's something
going on.

38:27.216 --> 38:29.136
Like what?
she's a good girl.

38:29.136 --> 38:30.736
She never gives us
any trouble.

38:30.736 --> 38:32.496
Would she confide
in you or your wife,

38:32.496 --> 38:33.736
if she had a problem?

38:33.736 --> 38:34.696
Yes.

38:35.776 --> 38:38.376
I mean, well...

38:38.376 --> 38:40.456
She used to.

38:40.456 --> 38:42.456
Ever since she's been going

38:42.456 --> 38:44.856
with Tommy, she doesn't
talk to us much.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.176
It's important to stay
in your daughter's life.

38:47.176 --> 38:49.936
My wife says if I complain,

38:49.936 --> 38:52.136
it'll just push them
together even more.

38:52.136 --> 38:54.576
Tells me that I forget how
all-consuming first love can be.

38:54.576 --> 38:57.296
Honey, I need you over here.
Yeah.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.616
Excuse me.

38:59.616 --> 39:01.136
TOMMY:
Hey, so, how about I

39:01.136 --> 39:03.576
bring over some Dvds?
We can just hang out, chill.

39:05.216 --> 39:07.936
OK, I'll tell your folks.

39:09.576 --> 39:11.536
You take care
of yourself, Jody.

39:11.536 --> 39:13.896
Uh-huh.
This is my card.

39:13.896 --> 39:15.496
My cell number's right
there on the back.

39:15.496 --> 39:17.656
If you have any problems,
day or night, call me, all right?

39:20.736 --> 39:23.016
I was thinking, what you said.

39:26.176 --> 39:28.776
Traffic was going really fast.

39:29.856 --> 39:31.616
I saw the red light.

39:31.616 --> 39:32.816
The red light?

39:33.456 --> 39:36.136
I wanted to-
MR NUGENT:
Not tonight, son!

39:36.136 --> 39:39.416
I could just follow you
home in my car...
I said no!

39:39.416 --> 39:41.016
MRS NUGENT:
She needs to rest.

39:41.016 --> 39:43.856
Jody, what were you gonna say?
Never mind.

39:43.856 --> 39:45.696
What...?

39:45.696 --> 39:48.016
OK, so, maybe tonight's
not the best movie night.

39:48.016 --> 39:49.696
But, um, I'll
see you tomorrow.

39:49.696 --> 39:51.016
OK?

39:51.016 --> 39:52.856
I love you.

39:52.856 --> 39:54.296
OK, sweetheart,
let's get you out of here.

39:54.296 --> 39:55.416
Mr Nugent...

39:55.416 --> 39:56.536
We got it from here.

39:56.536 --> 39:58.776
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

Yes, it is.

40:32.215 --> 40:34.935
Thank you.

40:34.935 --> 40:36.335
Frank, you paged me?

40:36.335 --> 40:38.455
Morris wants you to take
the ankle sprain in three

40:38.455 --> 40:40.455
and your buddy's waiting
for you in Curtain one.

40:40.455 --> 40:42.815
Really? who?

40:42.815 --> 40:44.775
Hello, my friend.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.255
Babu, are you having
more heart palpitations?

40:47.255 --> 40:49.575
Oh, no, it is my hand.

40:49.575 --> 40:51.175
I think it's broken.

40:51.175 --> 40:52.335
What happened?

40:52.335 --> 40:54.415
People have been
shaking my hand all day.

40:54.415 --> 40:55.535
They're happy for you.

40:55.535 --> 40:57.055
But they squeeze so hard.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.375
Your hand's not broken.

40:58.375 --> 40:59.455
It is not?

40:59.455 --> 41:01.255
No, and you know
what I think?

41:01.255 --> 41:04.255
I think you're nervous about
winning all that money,

41:04.255 --> 41:06.775
and your anxiety is
presenting as physical pain.

41:06.775 --> 41:09.215
I am overwhelmed.

41:09.215 --> 41:10.775
My life is good.

41:10.775 --> 41:12.175
I have the store,

41:12.175 --> 41:15.215
my family, my bookclub, now
everything has to change.

41:15.215 --> 41:16.855
I hate change.

41:16.855 --> 41:18.855
Take your time.

41:18.855 --> 41:21.415
You don't have to
decide anything today.

41:21.415 --> 41:22.375
You are right.

41:22.375 --> 41:24.215
I sleep on it.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.215
She denied
suicidal ideation.

41:26.215 --> 41:28.655
She's got no history of depression.
No vegetative symptoms.

41:28.655 --> 41:30.495
No anorexia, anhedonia or insomnia.

41:30.495 --> 41:31.895
What about the stress
with her boyfriend?

41:31.895 --> 41:33.895
Yeah, they both acknowledged
that they hit a rough patch,

41:33.895 --> 41:36.215
but they're working it out. And she
seems to have good family support.

41:36.215 --> 41:37.855
I talked to her again,
before she left.

41:37.855 --> 41:39.495
Did she say something?

41:39.495 --> 41:41.494
Not exactly.
Not exactly.

41:41.494 --> 41:43.854
No, well, she started to, but-
this is a hunch, OK?

41:43.854 --> 41:45.214
I gave her numbers
for outpatient counselling

41:45.214 --> 41:46.614
if she feels like
she needs it.

41:46.614 --> 41:48.014
No, I'm telling you,
we need to intervene.

41:48.014 --> 41:49.094
You want to send
the police to her house?

41:49.094 --> 41:50.494
No, but we've got
to do something.

41:50.494 --> 41:51.694
Like what?
I don't know!

41:51.694 --> 41:53.374
I mean, she was trying
to tell me something.

41:53.374 --> 41:54.894
If I had another five
minutes with her-

41:54.894 --> 41:57.894
Look, I know you're frustrated -
our hands are tied.

41:59.014 --> 42:02.454
What's the matter? Headshrinker
can't help you with your thrisis?

42:02.454 --> 42:04.454
It's not that.

42:04.454 --> 42:06.494
You know what, Frank?

42:06.494 --> 42:08.454
I'm going out
for a while.

42:08.454 --> 42:09.854
For how long?

42:09.854 --> 42:11.494
I'm not sure. Let Brenner know.

42:11.494 --> 42:13.534
RAZOR BUZZING

42:13.534 --> 42:14.774
MARQUEZ:
Finally.

42:14.774 --> 42:16.214
MALIK:
Yeah, you said it.

42:16.214 --> 42:17.934
What a gross job.

42:17.934 --> 42:19.214
Poor Grady.
GROANS

42:19.214 --> 42:20.454
Better him than me.

42:20.454 --> 42:21.574
What about Grady?

42:21.574 --> 42:22.894
He's giving hairy-lice
guy a shave.

42:22.894 --> 42:24.454
BRENNER:
Well, no, he's not.

42:24.454 --> 42:26.734
I just saw him with an
ankle sprain in three.

42:26.734 --> 42:28.054
Then who's in there?

42:30.294 --> 42:33.614
Joey? How'd you get roped into this?

42:33.614 --> 42:35.134
Grady gave me a hundred bucks.

42:35.134 --> 42:37.494
Oh, man.

42:49.494 --> 42:51.054
Hey, sir, you'll have
to turn back.

42:51.054 --> 42:53.054
I'm a doctor, maybe I can help.

42:55.134 --> 42:58.134
Please, you don't understand.
You're making a mistake!

42:58.134 --> 43:00.134
I need to be
with my daughter!

43:00.134 --> 43:01.614
Reidy, what the
hell happened?

43:01.614 --> 43:04.894
Repetitive blunt trauma
to head, neck and chest.

43:04.894 --> 43:06.294
Is he gonna make it?

43:06.294 --> 43:07.574
He's pulseless and apnic.

43:07.574 --> 43:10.134
He's had one round of epi
and atropine.

43:18.774 --> 43:19.733
Jody?

43:45.493 --> 43:47.853
FOOTSTEPS ECHO

43:48.493 --> 43:49.773
Where can you find
an investment

43:49.893 --> 43:51.653
that gives you the chance
every month

43:51.733 --> 43:53.373
to win a million pounds

43:53.453 --> 43:55.693
without risking your capital?

43:56.133 --> 43:58.093
Where can 23 million

43:58.173 --> 43:59.533
Premium Bond holders

43:59.613 --> 44:02.973
check their prizes online 24/7?

44:03.613 --> 44:06.773
Who do 27 million people

44:06.853 --> 44:08.773
trust with their savings?

44:08.853 --> 44:10.133
That's almost half

44:10.213 --> 44:12.373
the population of the UK.

44:12.933 --> 44:14.893
Where can you get all that?

44:17.933 --> 44:20.053
For more information
or to invest,

44:20.133 --> 44:21.853
go online to...

44:24.453 --> 44:26.613
This Easter,
we've got so much to choose from.

44:26.693 --> 44:27.373
DVDs.

44:27.493 --> 44:28.653
- Loads of toys.
- Chocolate.

44:28.773 --> 44:30.373
"High School Musical"
and "Ben 10".

44:30.453 --> 44:31.293
..each.

44:31.413 --> 44:33.053
- Great offer.
- Little dinky Smarties egg.

44:34.173 --> 44:35.333
Kids will love that.

44:35.413 --> 44:37.053
Three family DVDs for a tenner.

44:37.133 --> 44:38.253
Great films.

44:38.373 --> 44:39.853
- The "Bee Movie"...
- That's a good one.

44:39.973 --> 44:41.373
- "Shrek the Third."
- Grr!

44:42.413 --> 44:43.813
Good for keeping them quiet.

44:43.933 --> 44:45.773
We've got over a hundred toys
for Â£3 each or under.

44:45.853 --> 44:46.933
Absolute bargain.

44:47.053 --> 44:48.653
(electronic voice)
Always ready to help.

44:48.733 --> 44:49.413
Oh, yeah.

44:49.533 --> 44:51.373
This Easter, we promise
to save you money.

44:51.453 --> 44:52.013
Bye.

44:55.013 --> 44:57.172
How are your teeth today?
Not so clean?

44:57.292 --> 44:58.972
That's because
plaque starts to build up

44:59.092 --> 45:00.892
right after you get
a cleaning from the dentist.

45:00.972 --> 45:01.932
Some advice?

45:02.052 --> 45:04.652
Fight it with the latest innovation
from Colgate.

45:06.132 --> 45:09.092
Not only does it provide
12-hour antibacterial protection

45:09.172 --> 45:10.772
against plaque and gum problems,

45:10.852 --> 45:13.052
it also has a new:

45:13.172 --> 45:15.212
..that fights plaque
between dentist visits.

45:15.332 --> 45:16.852
It removes
build-up

45:16.972 --> 45:18.372
to give you
that...

45:18.492 --> 45:20.252
dentist-clean feeling
that lasts.

45:21.452 --> 45:23.092
The dentist-clean feeling
that lasts.

45:34.932 --> 45:36.532
Elvive Nutri-Gloss.

45:36.652 --> 45:38.132
L'Oreal's
first conditioner

45:38.252 --> 45:39.652
with
pearl protein.

45:40.652 --> 45:42.252
It transforms dull hair

45:42.332 --> 45:43.852
into hair that shimmers.

45:45.132 --> 45:46.572
With:

45:47.492 --> 45:48.932
With:

45:56.932 --> 45:58.012
And for
fine hair

45:58.132 --> 46:00.052
that gets greasy
quickly...

46:02.452 --> 46:03.092
You're worth it.

46:06.012 --> 46:07.332
It's very simple.

46:07.452 --> 46:10.092
Four fixed wheels
like to go in straight lines,

46:10.212 --> 46:12.612
whereas a ball
can move in any direction.

46:12.692 --> 46:14.572
So a clear choice -

46:14.652 --> 46:16.612
easy turns with minimal effort,

46:16.692 --> 46:19.412
or do it the old-fashioned way.

46:42.891 --> 46:44.531
Audi TDI Technology

46:44.611 --> 46:47.171
uses fuel with such precision...

46:47.931 --> 46:49.891
hardly a drop is wasted.

46:54.411 --> 46:56.971
JOLLY MUSIC

46:57.051 --> 47:01.171
Because Quorn mince is low in fat...

47:02.371 --> 47:05.851
and high in protein...

47:05.931 --> 47:07.171
(laughs)

47:07.251 --> 47:09.411
..it helps keep you light

47:09.491 --> 47:11.131
on your feet!

48:06.451 --> 48:08.571
Archie, what are you
doing here?

48:08.571 --> 48:11.010
I couldn't just let it go.

48:11.010 --> 48:14.010
I was gonna call you -
there was no time.

48:14.010 --> 48:16.570
MORRIS:
Did Jody do that?

48:16.570 --> 48:19.610
No, her father.

48:19.610 --> 48:22.610
Tommy showed up at the house.
I guess things escalated.

48:22.610 --> 48:25.850
The dad heard a commotion outside,
and saw Tommy attack her.

48:31.850 --> 48:33.170
It's going to be OK.

48:36.130 --> 48:38.130
He said he'd love me forever.

48:57.130 --> 48:59.170
How could he
do that to me?

48:59.170 --> 49:01.050
I think he did
it to Daria.
Ugh!

49:01.050 --> 49:03.090
I know.

49:03.090 --> 49:04.490
You know what?
I'm being stupid.

49:04.490 --> 49:06.490
No, no, no, don't
say that, come on.

49:06.490 --> 49:08.570
I mean, hello,
I broke up with him,

49:08.570 --> 49:11.090
I don't have a right
to feel like this.

49:11.090 --> 49:12.850
Didn't I mean
anything to him?

49:12.850 --> 49:14.450
Of course you did.

49:14.450 --> 49:16.850
You have every right to feel
whatever you want to feel.

49:16.850 --> 49:18.570
Daria? Really?

49:18.570 --> 49:20.650
I mean, OK, she's cute
and she's smart,

49:20.650 --> 49:21.890
or whatever,
but, God, really?

49:21.890 --> 49:23.730
Say the word, me and
the other nurses

49:23.730 --> 49:25.690
will take her out back
and rough her up.

49:25.690 --> 49:28.170
I already kinda did.

49:28.170 --> 49:30.690
I had a guy cheat on me.

49:30.690 --> 49:32.690
What'd you do?

49:32.690 --> 49:34.210
Cried a lot.

49:34.210 --> 49:36.690
Hated the other woman
until I realised

49:36.690 --> 49:39.610
that I should be mad at
my boyfriend, not her.

49:39.610 --> 49:41.890
And when I really thought
about it, he did me a favour.

49:41.890 --> 49:44.170
We weren't right
for each other.

49:44.170 --> 49:47.170
I never realised
that you were so zen.

49:47.170 --> 49:48.809
They ended up
getting married.

49:48.809 --> 49:50.809
OK, you're not helping.

49:50.809 --> 49:52.809
I'm sorry.

49:52.809 --> 49:54.089
Oh, you still love him?

49:56.609 --> 49:58.929
What are you gonna do?

50:01.049 --> 50:04.209
I plan on being
irrationally hurt and angry

50:04.209 --> 50:06.409
for as long as I like.

50:06.409 --> 50:09.209
Sounds good.

50:09.209 --> 50:11.209
Can we go inside now?
I can't feel my toes.

50:19.009 --> 50:21.049
GROANS

50:21.049 --> 50:24.049
I think
I slipped a disk.

50:24.049 --> 50:26.369
Babu, we talked
about this.

50:26.369 --> 50:28.409
Oh, just kidding.

50:28.409 --> 50:31.369
I came to tell you
I figured it out.

50:31.369 --> 50:32.769
You did?

50:32.769 --> 50:34.449
I bought a yacht.

50:34.449 --> 50:36.409
I fly to Greece tomorrow
to pick it up.

50:36.409 --> 50:37.769
Are you serious?

50:37.769 --> 50:39.169
Yes, but don't worry.

50:39.169 --> 50:42.809
I'm investing the rest
in a high-yield mutual fund.

50:42.809 --> 50:44.169
And...

50:44.169 --> 50:46.249
this is for you.

50:48.329 --> 50:50.329
Wow.

50:50.329 --> 50:51.729
Thanks.

50:53.009 --> 50:54.809
I'm really
going to miss you.

50:54.809 --> 50:56.089
Likewise, my friend.

51:10.929 --> 51:12.289
Hello?

51:19.009 --> 51:20.609
How many?

51:59.808 --> 52:01.848
Hey.

52:01.848 --> 52:03.248
Hey.
I'm sorry.

52:03.248 --> 52:04.808
What are you sorry about?

52:04.808 --> 52:06.808
You were hoping that there
wasn't gonna be any drama and...

52:06.808 --> 52:08.408
It was bound to happen.

52:08.408 --> 52:11.568
You want to go get a drink
and we can talk about it?

52:11.568 --> 52:14.448
Or maybe we could, you know,
go get some dinner at Ike's.

52:14.448 --> 52:16.088
Thanks, you know,
it's been a long day.

52:16.088 --> 52:17.848
I'm gonna get home.
Sarah's waiting for me.

52:17.848 --> 52:19.208
I can just call
you later.

52:21.328 --> 52:23.408
I don't think
that would be good.

52:25.808 --> 52:28.248
Look, I had a great time.

52:28.248 --> 52:29.928
It was fun.

52:29.928 --> 52:31.208
But?

52:31.208 --> 52:32.808
But it's not
going to happen.
OK.

52:32.808 --> 52:35.168
Maybe if it was another time,

52:35.168 --> 52:36.848
but it's not over with Sam-
not for me, anyway.

52:36.848 --> 52:38.808
Mm.

52:41.328 --> 52:44.088
I'd be lying if I didn't
say I was disappointed.

52:44.088 --> 52:45.488
But I get it.

52:47.568 --> 52:49.568
Hope it works out.

52:49.568 --> 52:50.728
Yeah.

52:50.728 --> 52:51.768
Thanks.

52:51.768 --> 52:52.728
Me, too.

52:52.728 --> 52:53.848
Mm-hmm.

52:58.888 --> 53:01.727
Chuny, the ABG on the
firefighter in two

53:01.727 --> 53:03.407
came back negative
for carbon monoxide.

53:03.407 --> 53:04.847
You can, er,
send him home.

53:04.847 --> 53:05.927
You got it.

53:05.927 --> 53:07.847
You out of here?
Oh, yes, I am.

53:07.847 --> 53:09.487
Thanks, you two,
for your help today.

53:09.487 --> 53:11.487
Yeah, have a good one.

53:11.487 --> 53:13.207
Night, Neela.

53:13.207 --> 53:15.407
BRENNER:
Neela.

53:15.407 --> 53:17.047
Neela, hold up.

53:21.727 --> 53:25.567
The drama never ends
around here.

53:25.567 --> 53:27.567
Neela!

53:27.567 --> 53:29.567
Neela, what was that?

53:29.567 --> 53:31.447
What was what?

53:31.447 --> 53:34.487
That, back there, at the desk.
You were deliberately avoiding me.

53:34.487 --> 53:36.567
Nonsense. I didn't even see you.

53:36.567 --> 53:38.927
What, you didn't, you didn't
just look right at me,

53:38.927 --> 53:41.007
and then take off
like a bat out of hell.

53:41.007 --> 53:42.727
Well, it's been
a long day,

53:42.727 --> 53:46.647
and I'm bleary-eyed. By the way, Mrs
Feingold's surgery went really well.

53:46.647 --> 53:48.287
That's, that's good.

53:48.287 --> 53:51.047
Well, her and her ex
were so grateful,

53:51.047 --> 53:52.487
he proposed to her again.
She said yes.

53:52.487 --> 53:54.887
And, I mean, what does a bride
wear on her fourth wedding?

53:54.887 --> 53:56.527
Red or black?
I don't know.

53:56.527 --> 53:58.007
I don't know- you OK?

53:58.007 --> 53:59.407
Do they register gifts?

53:59.407 --> 54:02.247
I mean, that, yeah,
that would be gauche.

54:02.247 --> 54:04.447
OK, OK. Neela,
you've been acting

54:04.447 --> 54:06.007
really weird
around me all day.

54:06.007 --> 54:07.847
Have I, have I done
something wrong?

54:09.647 --> 54:11.527
Yes.

54:11.527 --> 54:13.767
No.

54:15.287 --> 54:17.727
Which one is it?

54:17.727 --> 54:20.207
Neela, if...if you're
angry with me...

54:20.207 --> 54:22.447
You know, why do you have
to be so damn...

54:22.447 --> 54:24.007
What, er...?

54:24.007 --> 54:26.527
Charming? Sexy?
Kind of good at maths...

54:26.527 --> 54:29.327
Uh, OK, yes, I did think about you
the whole time you were away.

54:29.327 --> 54:31.327
You happy now?

54:31.327 --> 54:33.287
Yes.

54:36.247 --> 54:38.326
But why are you so mad?

54:40.366 --> 54:42.366
Because I like you.

54:42.366 --> 54:45.686
I don't want to, but I do.

54:45.686 --> 54:47.646
And I...want to be with you.

54:47.646 --> 54:49.606
There, I said it. You can go
ahead and gloat now.

54:49.606 --> 54:51.286
Gloat? Why would I gloat?

54:51.286 --> 54:53.046
Because you predicted it,

54:53.046 --> 54:55.166
so, go ahead -
I know you want to.

54:59.886 --> 55:01.846
I'd rather do something else.

56:43.445 --> 56:47.485
Wouldn't it be nice if you could save
money when you do the washing?

56:47.485 --> 56:49.805
And still clean off tough stains
like beans?
