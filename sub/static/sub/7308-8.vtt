00:12.971 --> 00:14.681
So, what do you think?

00:18.894 --> 00:21.104
Not bad, l suppose.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.441
''Not bad,'' she says as she walks in
from the outdoor patio,

00:24.650 --> 00:29.363
past the fax machine and the minibar,
complimentary basket of fruit.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.406
This is the perfect way to spend
a weekend.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.328
Come on. Big-screen TV.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.997
Two hundred channels.

00:39.248 --> 00:43.335
Look at this.
HBO, ESPN, The History Channel.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.921
Turner Classic Movies.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.801
l take it you're not interested
in the premium channels?

00:51.051 --> 00:54.263
There's only one thing
l'm interested in right now.

01:59.542 --> 02:02.003
- Do you think they bought it?
- l did.

02:03.004 --> 02:06.591
- That's fairly obvious.
- For your information, that's my knee.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.259
Whatever.
You can get off of me now.

02:09.511 --> 02:13.348
lt's only been ten minutes.
l have a reputation to protect.

02:13.556 --> 02:16.017
We're not even sure
if we're under surveillance yet, Tony.

02:16.226 --> 02:18.520
You can't be too careful
when you're undercover.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.231
Let's give it another 40 minutes,
just to be realistic.

02:21.439 --> 02:23.733
Realistic, huh?

02:24.526 --> 02:25.527
ln that case...

02:28.405 --> 02:31.074
- ...l'll just ride on top.
- l can live with that.

02:35.537 --> 02:37.997
- What was that for?
- Because that

02:38.248 --> 02:40.917
was definitely not your knee.

02:45.714 --> 02:47.924
Oh, she's very beautiful, Jethro.

02:48.091 --> 02:50.385
Her name's Sophie Ranier.

02:50.677 --> 02:52.887
She's murdered
over 25 people, Duck.

02:53.138 --> 02:54.848
And her friend?

02:55.056 --> 02:58.727
Her husband. Jean-Paul Ranier.

02:59.728 --> 03:03.732
Both Canadian citizens,
both contract assassins.

03:03.940 --> 03:06.067
She suffered extensive injuries.

03:06.276 --> 03:09.904
lt may take quite a while
to determine the actual cause of death.

03:10.071 --> 03:12.031
They were killed in a car accident
two days ago

03:12.198 --> 03:13.867
outside of Kuwait lnternational Airport.

03:14.075 --> 03:17.495
- Here's the accident report.
- l'm assuming this is urgent.

03:17.746 --> 03:20.582
<i>l've waited three months
to see Giselle.</i>

03:20.749 --> 03:22.584
Yeah, apologies about the girlfriend,
Duck.

03:22.751 --> 03:24.878
<i>- But l do need you to--
- Giselle's a ballet.</i>

03:25.086 --> 03:28.089
You really should get out
of your basement more, Jethro.

03:35.555 --> 03:38.266
We need to know everything we can
about these two, Ducky.

03:38.475 --> 03:41.102
Why is NClS investigating this?

03:41.311 --> 03:44.272
Marine ClD found
two fake U.S. passports

03:44.439 --> 03:47.150
and two first-class tickets
for Washington, D.C. in their luggage.

03:47.317 --> 03:49.778
They have reservations at the Barclay
through November 1 0th.

03:50.779 --> 03:53.448
- Marine Corps Birthday.
- They're holding the ball there.

03:53.656 --> 03:55.784
Hosted by the commandant
of the Marine Corps.

03:55.992 --> 03:57.994
Our top military leaders,
congressmen

03:58.161 --> 04:01.623
and agency directors will be there,
including me.

04:01.790 --> 04:05.293
Tony and Ziva have taken
their room reservations at the Barclay.

04:05.543 --> 04:08.338
They're there now
pretending to be these two.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.049
- They're working blind, Duck.
- We're counting on you

04:11.299 --> 04:15.303
to fill them in on some of the more
personal details of our couple.

04:15.512 --> 04:19.015
Oh, though it may be common
knowledge that l talk to my patients,

04:19.182 --> 04:23.269
unfortunately, to date, none of them
have ever answered me back.

04:23.436 --> 04:25.313
Listen harder.

04:30.735 --> 04:35.031
Sweetheart, you know
what l could really use right now?

04:36.116 --> 04:37.867
Some deodorant?

04:38.118 --> 04:42.330
l was thinking more along the lines
of a back massage.

04:44.499 --> 04:45.959
Good idea.

04:46.167 --> 04:49.587
Why don't you roll over
like a good boy.

04:55.510 --> 04:58.263
Oh, wow.

04:58.471 --> 05:02.642
Oh, and to think my mother thought
l was too good for you.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.528
What'd l miss?

05:13.820 --> 05:15.363
They had sex.

05:15.572 --> 05:18.908
- Did they have contact with anyone?
- Just each other.

05:19.159 --> 05:21.202
Multiple times.

05:21.870 --> 05:23.997
Was it good for you?

05:25.290 --> 05:28.418
Wait.
Someone's knocking at their door.

05:28.668 --> 05:31.212
<i>- Who is it?
- Room service.</i>

05:31.379 --> 05:33.506
Room service.

05:35.383 --> 05:38.094
Compliments
of the hotel management.

05:42.515 --> 05:45.351
Gibbs wants me to sweep the room
for bugs and place some of our own.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.104
And he also wants to talk to you.

05:48.897 --> 05:51.024
You can put it over there, please.

05:51.232 --> 05:52.901
Very good, ma'am.

05:57.572 --> 06:00.200
GarÃ§on, we'd like
some extra bath towels.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.702
<i>Of course.</i>

06:03.912 --> 06:05.914
Just checking to make sure
everything's in order.

06:11.086 --> 06:13.922
Would you like me to have the maid
make up the bed for you, sir?

06:14.089 --> 06:16.758
Oh, that won't be necessary.

06:17.342 --> 06:21.721
<i>Oh, and will you check the minibar?
We'd like it restocked with Red Bull.</i>

06:21.930 --> 06:23.390
Red Bull.

06:23.598 --> 06:27.102
- That'll keep you up all night, ma'am.
- Exactly.

06:34.609 --> 06:40.240
Please accept this assortment of
cheeses compliments of the hotel.

06:42.575 --> 06:44.411
- What's wrong?
- Room service put a tray

06:44.577 --> 06:46.955
- on our microphone.
- Well, you know what that means.

06:47.163 --> 06:48.248
We're screwed?

06:48.915 --> 06:50.458
Nope.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.961
You get to dress up as a maid, Maya.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.841
lf you whisper, it should be okay.

06:58.091 --> 07:00.635
<i>- Comfortable, DiNozzo?
- Well, yeah.</i>

07:00.885 --> 07:02.470
<i>l'm working on it.
Why do you ask?</i>

07:02.637 --> 07:04.806
<i>We're looking at you,
Agent DiNozzo.</i>

07:05.640 --> 07:07.475
All of you.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.148
<i>- Sorry about that.
- DiNozzo.</i>

07:13.398 --> 07:15.859
What the hell are you doing?
You're married assassins.

07:16.025 --> 07:17.902
You're not visiting
the Playboy mansion.

07:18.111 --> 07:20.155
<i>lt was kind of Ziva's idea, boss.</i>

07:22.949 --> 07:25.160
- lncoming call.
- Have her answer it.

07:26.202 --> 07:29.330
Sweet cheeks, do you think you could
go over and answer the phone for me

07:29.497 --> 07:31.207
while l pour us some champagne?

07:34.002 --> 07:35.712
Thanks, honey.

07:41.009 --> 07:42.719
Yes.

07:43.011 --> 07:45.555
There's a cell phone
in the Bible next to your bed.

07:51.436 --> 07:52.937
Got it.

07:53.855 --> 07:56.316
Keep it with you at all times.

07:56.483 --> 07:59.736
You have dinner reservations
at the hotel dining room at 9:00.

08:00.653 --> 08:02.489
Don't be late.

08:04.741 --> 08:05.825
The concierge.

08:06.034 --> 08:09.871
We were able to get
into the dining room after all, my love.

08:11.748 --> 08:15.668
lt looks like l'm getting dressed up
for you tonight.

08:20.882 --> 08:23.676
That wasn't the concierge.
That was their contact.

08:23.885 --> 08:25.678
We're on the move.

08:26.763 --> 08:28.598
Let's go. We've gotta get dressed
for dinner.

08:28.765 --> 08:29.849
l'm coming.

08:30.058 --> 08:31.976
Don't look at me that way, Gibbs.

08:32.184 --> 08:35.020
l was at league night
when l got your 91 1 .

08:35.230 --> 08:37.774
l was two frames away
from a perfect score.

08:38.024 --> 08:40.485
And just for the record,
the stupid outfits were not my idea.

08:40.693 --> 08:42.611
- l like it.
- lt is kind of cute, huh?

08:42.861 --> 08:45.240
No sign of Mr. Palmer, l suppose.

08:45.490 --> 08:48.618
- Not since this afternoon, Ducky.
- Abs, these are their personal effects.

08:48.868 --> 08:49.869
Get yourself wired

08:50.078 --> 08:53.581
so you can feed whatever you find
directly to DiNozzo and David.

08:53.748 --> 08:57.085
- Looking for anything in particular?
- Anything that will help those two

08:57.293 --> 08:59.003
act like them.

09:04.509 --> 09:08.430
- Solid on the visuals, Tony.
- There's quite a crowd here tonight.

09:08.596 --> 09:12.016
- See anyone you know?
- Not yet.

09:12.267 --> 09:14.936
But the night's just getting started,
my little hairy butt.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.774
- Abs?
- l'm loading the photos.

09:21.109 --> 09:22.610
Any scoop
for our married couple?

09:22.777 --> 09:26.614
l have the breakdown of the contents
of their stomachs and intestines.

09:26.781 --> 09:29.159
lf Mr. Ranier had lived,
l would have suggested

09:29.325 --> 09:30.910
a more fibre-rich diet.

09:31.119 --> 09:34.456
<i>His colon was almost impacted
with faecal material.</i>

09:36.541 --> 09:38.293
Do you think it's too late
to order a salad?

09:40.170 --> 09:42.839
Good evening, table for two?

09:43.089 --> 09:45.133
l believe our food is here now.

09:57.103 --> 09:58.605
McGee, report.

09:58.813 --> 10:01.149
l've got the restaurant
covered from the entrance, boss.

10:04.194 --> 10:06.154
l'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.

10:06.321 --> 10:08.364
Tony, the calluses
on Mr. Ranier's hand,

10:08.573 --> 10:11.576
<i>- suggest he was left-handed.
- Switch hands, DiNozzo.</i>

10:17.082 --> 10:18.792
This is nice, isn't it?

10:19.000 --> 10:24.589
Yeah, a quiet little dinner,
just the six of us.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.008
Our friend is calling.

10:30.887 --> 10:32.847
- Abs, l want that number.
- Got it.

10:33.098 --> 10:35.183
Starting the reverse search
directory now.

10:35.392 --> 10:36.976
l'm glad you called.

10:37.185 --> 10:39.187
We were getting bored.

10:39.396 --> 10:42.107
l thought it would help
to see your target in person tonight.

10:43.024 --> 10:45.235
<i>- He's here?
- You don't see him?</i>

10:45.485 --> 10:48.363
Relax, l've been flying
for over 20 hours.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.534
<i>And the restaurant's packed.
We will.</i>

10:53.535 --> 10:56.538
- Talk to me, Abs.
- From a pay phone. Address coming.

10:56.704 --> 10:59.874
You didn't mention anything about
being surrounded by U.S. Marines.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.002
<i>lt's too dangerous
for the sum you're paying us.</i>

11:03.211 --> 11:05.547
Accomplish your mission,
we'll discuss more.

11:07.132 --> 11:08.216
But you won't pay us more.

11:10.051 --> 11:12.721
Got it. 2205 M Street.

11:12.929 --> 11:15.056
He's calling from a pay phone
inside the restaurant.

11:15.223 --> 11:16.975
<i>- DiNozzo. McGee.
- Already moving.</i>

11:17.142 --> 11:18.685
l have to go
to the little boys' room.

11:19.436 --> 11:22.355
- l have to talk to my boss.
- Do that.

11:22.564 --> 11:23.898
We'll wait for you to--

11:25.900 --> 11:27.569
He hung up.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.741
Don't move. Federal agent.

11:33.950 --> 11:35.285
lt's me, probie. He's gone.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.767
Must've slipped out
through the kitchen.

11:50.017 --> 11:51.518
<i>l didn't even get a look.</i>

11:51.727 --> 11:53.228
You want us back
in the squad room?

11:53.479 --> 11:56.607
No. l want you and Ziva back
in your room, maintaining your cover.

11:58.067 --> 12:00.444
Oh, all night?

12:00.694 --> 12:02.821
Do l stutter or something, DiNozzo?

12:07.409 --> 12:10.746
Afraid l'll bite, Tony?

12:10.996 --> 12:14.041
The name is Jean-Paul, Sophie.

12:14.249 --> 12:15.876
Jean-Paul.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.796
- Hey, Abs, what do you got?
- l have a ''whoopee''

12:19.004 --> 12:20.756
- and l have a but.
- Abby--

12:20.923 --> 12:24.301
l've got a photo of the man that Tony
and Ziva are gonna assassinate.

12:24.551 --> 12:26.512
- But?
- But...

12:27.513 --> 12:31.642
...l have no idea
which of these 32 photos is him.

12:33.268 --> 12:35.396
What makes you think
the target's a male?

12:35.604 --> 12:37.981
- Did you forget l'll be there?
- Nope.

12:38.232 --> 12:41.985
Whoever set up the hit referred
to the collar as a man.

12:42.236 --> 12:45.030
- You've made contact.
- Ziva got a pay-phone call.

12:45.239 --> 12:47.116
You trace it?

12:49.034 --> 12:50.119
Why didn't l think of that?

12:51.078 --> 12:53.288
Sorry, Jethro. l'm a little tired.

12:53.539 --> 12:57.126
Yeah, well, you never
could pace yourself very well.

13:02.965 --> 13:05.134
l have one word for you, Jethro.

13:06.635 --> 13:09.096
- Positano.
- Come on.

13:09.304 --> 13:11.974
That was a week
after l took a bullet.

13:13.308 --> 13:15.644
- Where did the call originate?
- Pay phone in the hotel.

13:15.811 --> 13:17.479
We got there. The guy was gone.

13:17.688 --> 13:19.982
At least we know he's
keeping tabs on the operation.

13:20.149 --> 13:23.318
Abby's matching these photos
with reservations in the restaurant.

13:23.485 --> 13:25.946
She'll check the names
against invites to the ball.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.656
lt'll narrow the target.

13:27.865 --> 13:29.950
What if the hit has nothing to do
with the ball?

13:30.117 --> 13:32.995
- Someone who's a guest at the hotel?
- Ziva told him

13:33.162 --> 13:36.457
she didn't know the target
would be surrounded by Marines.

13:36.665 --> 13:39.376
- And he wasn't surprised?
- No.

13:42.004 --> 13:45.174
Hey, nothing's gonna happen tonight.

13:45.966 --> 13:47.509
Tony and Ziva are hitting the rack.

13:47.718 --> 13:49.928
All the backup teams are in place
around the hotel.

13:50.137 --> 13:53.098
Why don't you go grab 40
on the couch in your office.

13:53.307 --> 13:55.851
No. l just need a little coffee.

13:56.018 --> 13:59.188
Yeah?
And when the caffeine jolt ends?

13:59.355 --> 14:01.148
l'll do what you do.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.984
- Get a refill.
- You're not me.

14:04.193 --> 14:08.238
- Chauvinist.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:08.906 --> 14:11.367
l guess. Good night, Jen.

14:12.910 --> 14:14.828
Jethro.

14:15.371 --> 14:18.040
l need to bounce something off you.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.752
Okay, shoot.

14:22.336 --> 14:25.255
My director side is telling me
to flood that hotel with security

14:25.422 --> 14:29.009
and notify the FBl
of a potential terrorist attack.

14:29.218 --> 14:31.345
My agent side?

14:31.553 --> 14:34.723
lf l do that, we lose the chance
to take down an enemy cell

14:34.890 --> 14:36.850
operating inside the Capitol.

14:37.059 --> 14:39.061
They'll scatter.

14:39.937 --> 14:42.231
Of course, you'd stay the course.

14:42.439 --> 14:44.024
Trust your people
to get the job done.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.694
Are you telling me what l'd do?

14:47.903 --> 14:49.363
Asking.

14:52.199 --> 14:56.412
lf l was director,
l'd give my people another 24.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.456
They can't get the job done,
l'd notify the FBl.

14:59.707 --> 15:01.542
You'd really do that?

15:02.251 --> 15:03.752
Nah.

15:04.294 --> 15:06.755
But that's why l'll never be director.

15:25.441 --> 15:27.609
The man snores
like a drunken sailor.

15:27.776 --> 15:29.570
Well, we won't have to listen
much longer.

15:29.778 --> 15:32.448
They saw their target at the restaurant.
We're on plan.

15:33.115 --> 15:36.201
l watched the videotape
of their session this afternoon, Maya.

15:36.410 --> 15:38.537
lt's pretty hot stuff.

15:38.787 --> 15:41.123
Those two really know
how to live their life.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.125
You...

15:43.459 --> 15:45.586
- ...ever think about that maybe--
- Forget it.

15:45.794 --> 15:49.798
We're here on a mission, period.
You want something more than coffee,

15:49.965 --> 15:52.718
call room service.

16:00.476 --> 16:01.810
Oh, my God.

16:01.977 --> 16:03.812
Ziva.

16:10.152 --> 16:13.572
Come on, you're killing me here.

16:15.616 --> 16:17.368
Sophie.

16:19.161 --> 16:21.997
- What?
- Nothing. l thought l heard something.

16:27.836 --> 16:29.797
Crazy chick.

16:30.672 --> 16:32.758
l heard that, my little hairy butt.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.684
Good morning, boss.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.563
Thank you.

16:50.401 --> 16:53.487
Hey, boss, this was sitting
on my front porch this morning.

16:53.987 --> 16:57.032
- What is it?
- lt's a package addressed to Ziva.

16:57.199 --> 17:00.035
Well, yeah. l can see that, McGee.
What is in it?

17:00.661 --> 17:02.705
l wasn't sure if l should open it.

17:04.998 --> 17:10.045
That's probably why
she's using you as her mule.

17:19.387 --> 17:20.723
Sunglasses?

17:22.057 --> 17:23.308
With different lenses?

17:24.309 --> 17:25.394
Why?

17:25.602 --> 17:26.686
To protect her eyes?

17:29.314 --> 17:30.733
l'll ask her. l'll find out.

17:30.899 --> 17:33.277
Yeah, good idea, McGee.

17:33.527 --> 17:35.529
Send their wake-up call.

17:39.616 --> 17:41.118
<i>Tony.</i>

17:42.453 --> 17:44.538
<i>Hey, DiNozzo.</i>

17:45.039 --> 17:46.915
Tony.

17:47.082 --> 17:48.625
This is great.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.919
They're sleeping in a five-star hotel.
l'm a waiter.

17:51.128 --> 17:53.088
<i>Want to trade places, McGee?</i>

17:53.255 --> 17:54.631
You're awake.

17:54.882 --> 17:57.176
Since 05.

17:57.426 --> 18:00.596
- He snores.
- l got a package here for you.

18:01.764 --> 18:03.098
<i>My shades.</i>

18:03.891 --> 18:05.392
Can you bring them up
with breakfast?

18:05.601 --> 18:07.728
Sure. Gibbs wants Tony up too.

18:09.229 --> 18:10.939
My pleasure.

18:15.444 --> 18:19.198
Jean-Paul, my little furry bear.

18:19.907 --> 18:22.117
<i>- Wake up, chÃ©ri.
- Name and position, boss.</i>

18:25.245 --> 18:28.290
Make the stitches precise,
Mr. Palmer.

18:28.499 --> 18:30.959
- Yes, doctor.
- And when you're done,

18:31.251 --> 18:34.296
l want the supply locker
inventoried and cleaned.

18:34.505 --> 18:37.132
l actually already did that, doctor.

18:37.299 --> 18:40.094
- Then do it again.
- What have we found out, Duck?

18:40.302 --> 18:44.139
That my assistant, Mr. Palmer here,
should keep his cell phone with him

18:44.306 --> 18:46.141
and turned on at all times.

18:46.308 --> 18:48.435
What can you tell me
about our assassins?

18:48.602 --> 18:51.397
Oh, Mr. Ranier here
had his appendix removed.

18:51.605 --> 18:54.817
Mrs. had her left wrist broken
as a child.

18:54.983 --> 18:59.822
We did, however,
find some rather curious markings.

18:59.988 --> 19:03.826
- Markings?
- Tattoos might be more appropriate.

19:04.034 --> 19:05.994
Almost invisible to the naked eye.

19:06.662 --> 19:11.291
On the inside of the fourth digit
of both of their left hands.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.211
- An eight?
- Or the sign for infinity.

19:14.461 --> 19:16.130
Some kind of terrorist cell lD?

19:16.338 --> 19:20.968
On their ring fingers,
perhaps it means love forever.

19:21.176 --> 19:24.221
You know, l want to take another look
at the x-rays,

19:24.471 --> 19:25.973
make sure
l didn't miss anything else.

19:26.181 --> 19:27.850
Yeah, do it.

19:28.976 --> 19:31.520
You missed a stitch there, Palmer.

19:39.570 --> 19:43.198
We really should take you
to see the doctor, sweet cheeks.

19:44.658 --> 19:45.993
Why's that?

19:46.994 --> 19:49.455
Because you snore
like a drunken sailor with emphysema.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.879
Look who's calling the pot black.

19:57.379 --> 20:00.341
Kettle. The pot
is calling the kettle black.

20:04.345 --> 20:05.721
l'd really like some music.

20:06.972 --> 20:11.769
Something with a little beat, dear.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.396
Sorry.

20:19.526 --> 20:23.197
- What have we got?
- Sneaky people.

20:26.116 --> 20:27.993
<i>Top floor, northwest corner, Gibbs.</i>

20:28.202 --> 20:30.079
<i>They have a laser
trained on our room.</i>

20:30.245 --> 20:32.373
l can't believe
that your sunglasses can detect

20:32.539 --> 20:33.957
different light spectrums. Amazing.

20:34.124 --> 20:35.751
We're going to need
a diversion.

20:35.918 --> 20:39.088
<i>- l think we can manage something,
- Let's roll, McGee.</i>

20:40.589 --> 20:43.300
''Ziva, that is amazing.''

20:43.550 --> 20:45.302
Big whoop, she has spy glasses.

20:45.552 --> 20:47.221
Anyone could do that.
That's not amazing.

20:47.388 --> 20:49.431
<i>- She's just--
- You realise we can still hear you,</i>

20:49.640 --> 20:51.141
<i>right, Abby?</i>

20:54.645 --> 20:56.939
l think l'm gonna need
a cold shower after this.

20:57.147 --> 20:59.108
Disgusting.

21:02.444 --> 21:04.571
Give me those binoculars.

21:06.323 --> 21:07.908
l don't know how much longer

21:08.075 --> 21:10.744
- l can keep this up.
- Ninety-six,

21:10.953 --> 21:13.414
97, 98--

21:17.167 --> 21:19.128
We're in position, DiNozzo.

21:19.336 --> 21:20.421
Give it the big finish.

21:21.630 --> 21:24.967
We could make a fortune
with this off the lnternet.

21:25.175 --> 21:28.262
They're serial killers, Yussif.
l wouldn't recommend trying.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.478
- FBl, freeze!
- Put them down!

21:46.864 --> 21:47.948
<i>What's this all about?</i>

21:48.699 --> 21:51.368
l have a whole new respect for NClS,
Agent McGee.

21:51.577 --> 21:54.121
- You guys are hard-core.
- We got lucky.

21:54.329 --> 21:57.750
lt was actually the trained laser
on the room that gave you away.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.336
We were talking about your agents
pretending to be married assassins.

22:01.545 --> 22:03.630
- Very convincing.
- l don't think anyone in the FBl

22:03.797 --> 22:06.342
would actually go all the way
just to sell a cover story.

22:06.592 --> 22:09.053
- l would.
- Guys, they were acting.

22:09.303 --> 22:10.721
Trust me.

22:10.929 --> 22:12.931
l know when someone's acting
when they're having sex.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.225
lt's true. l've met his wife.

22:23.650 --> 22:25.652
Tony and Ziva wouldn't--

22:25.861 --> 22:27.738
<i>lt's unusual for a man
to like love stories.</i>

22:30.324 --> 22:32.701
How do l explain
to the director of the FBl

22:32.868 --> 22:35.579
that we're running an undercover op
in his jurisdiction

22:35.746 --> 22:38.374
- without informing him?
- With a smile.

22:38.582 --> 22:40.501
lt's not funny, Gibbs.

22:40.709 --> 22:43.629
They had intel the two assassins
were going to hit a target

22:43.837 --> 22:47.091
at the Marine Corps Birthday Ball.
Did you get that memo?

22:48.050 --> 22:49.635
No.

22:50.928 --> 22:52.554
Why didn't l think of that?

22:52.763 --> 22:54.765
Because you're exhausted.

22:54.932 --> 22:58.268
l told you get some sleep,

22:58.435 --> 23:02.189
and do that before you take on
the director of the FBl.

23:02.398 --> 23:05.025
- l can't, Jethro.
- l can fix this.

23:05.234 --> 23:08.112
- How?
- You're not the only one around here

23:08.278 --> 23:09.780
who knows how to play politics.

23:12.282 --> 23:14.284
You're not serious?

23:15.202 --> 23:19.248
Your idea of politics usually involves
some form of physical violence.

23:19.915 --> 23:21.542
Well, you know what they say, Jen.

23:22.584 --> 23:25.963
You can't make an omelette
unless you break a few eggs.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.305
- Are we free to go now?
- Not yet.

23:35.556 --> 23:38.225
- What is NClS doing at the Barclay?
- Our job, Fornell.

23:38.434 --> 23:41.103
Yeah? That involve
jeopardising our operation?

23:41.311 --> 23:43.605
You're damn lucky
we didn't blow these two away.

23:43.814 --> 23:47.192
Which wouldn't have happened if
you hadn't strayed into our jurisdiction.

23:48.318 --> 23:52.239
- Conference room. Now. Really?
- So anxious to play with the big boys.

23:52.448 --> 23:54.992
- Big boys, my ass.
- Yeah, this is gonna be ugly.

23:55.159 --> 23:58.704
Oh, yeah.
Fornell hasn't been this upset since--

23:58.912 --> 24:00.831
The last time we saw him.

24:12.676 --> 24:13.677
Gum?

24:14.845 --> 24:15.929
''The big boys''?

24:20.768 --> 24:24.104
- We really screwed this one up.
- Oh, you think, Tobias?

24:24.313 --> 24:25.773
The question is, how do we fix it

24:25.939 --> 24:29.109
without our directors getting
into a world-class pissing match?

24:29.318 --> 24:31.362
- Joint op.
- Whose lead?

24:31.945 --> 24:33.197
My team's already in place.

24:33.447 --> 24:35.824
- Did you find out who hired them?
- Not yet. Working on it.

24:36.033 --> 24:38.786
l need more than that in my tap dance
at the Hoover Building.

24:38.994 --> 24:40.537
Give us 24 hours, then we flip.

24:40.788 --> 24:43.957
- FBl gets operational control?
- Yeah, and credit for the collar.

24:44.166 --> 24:47.211
Agreed. The directors
get to save face and we--

24:47.378 --> 24:49.296
Get the job done.

24:50.172 --> 24:54.677
- And people say we're bastards?
- Only because they know us.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.851
l've got the lDs on the people
in the restaurant

25:03.018 --> 25:04.687
with invites to the Marine Corps Ball.

25:06.980 --> 25:09.733
- Abby. Sorry.
- Make sure Tony and Ziva get them.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.944
Okay, should l also check
the restaurant staff too?

25:14.029 --> 25:16.198
lnternational assassins hired
to take out a waiter.

25:16.407 --> 25:18.701
- l was just trying to be thorough.
- No.

25:18.909 --> 25:20.703
lt's good. Good instincts, Chip.
Run them.

25:20.869 --> 25:22.371
Okay.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.708
Abby, can l ask you a question?

25:25.916 --> 25:27.543
Yes.

25:27.751 --> 25:30.212
Why don't you like Officer David?

25:33.007 --> 25:34.550
What makes you think
l don't like her?

25:34.758 --> 25:36.343
l found this.

25:39.888 --> 25:41.306
That.

25:41.515 --> 25:44.059
Oh, l understand.
l have the same problem with DiNozzo.

25:44.309 --> 25:47.730
Tony is a great guy.
You just have to get to know him.

25:47.938 --> 25:50.941
Yeah, well, you don't know him
like l do.

25:51.108 --> 25:53.235
He gives new people grief,
he learned that from Gibbs.

25:53.444 --> 25:55.529
Okay, quiz time.

25:55.738 --> 25:58.449
What's your take
on Sophie Ranier's blood test?

25:58.615 --> 26:02.453
Well, she's got elevated levels
of human chorionic gonadotropin.

26:02.703 --> 26:04.621
- Which means?
- She's pregnant?

26:04.830 --> 26:07.041
- Good, Chip. She's pregnant.
- Who's pregnant?

26:07.249 --> 26:11.628
Ziva. l mean, not ''Ziva'' Ziva,
but Sophie Ranier, our dead hit girl.

26:11.879 --> 26:13.797
She's got a bun in the oven.

26:15.883 --> 26:17.593
Like what you see, Agent DiNozzo?

26:17.801 --> 26:20.554
The room's clean except
for the listening devices we installed.

26:20.721 --> 26:24.558
- We're free to talk.
- Yeah, so

26:24.975 --> 26:26.727
you're the one
who's been watching us?

26:26.935 --> 26:28.354
Oh, yeah.

26:28.562 --> 26:31.398
When this is over,
we really should go out for drinks.

26:32.649 --> 26:33.817
l'd like that.

26:34.902 --> 26:36.070
l'm pregnant, Tony.

26:38.739 --> 26:40.783
Maybe some other time.

26:40.991 --> 26:42.826
She was-- She was kidding.

26:42.993 --> 26:44.161
Something wrong?

26:44.370 --> 26:47.122
- Thanks.
- She's really not your type anyway.

26:47.331 --> 26:50.834
Hot and in a maid's outfit?
They don't get any more my type.

26:53.003 --> 26:54.922
He's learning.

26:55.089 --> 26:56.340
Number's blocked.

26:58.175 --> 26:59.677
Talk to me.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.846
l've been told to negotiate a price
commensurate with the risk.

27:03.681 --> 27:05.974
<i>- l'm listening.
- Not on the phone.</i>

27:06.266 --> 27:08.143
<i>Be in the lobby in exactly one hour.</i>

27:08.352 --> 27:10.104
A black Lincoln
will be waiting out front.

27:10.312 --> 27:12.856
Make sure you're not followed.

27:15.025 --> 27:17.653
- ln position, boss.
- Your people set, Tobias?

27:17.861 --> 27:19.530
Got four unmarked vehicles
standing by.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.198
We'll follow them wherever they go.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.409
Tony, Ziva, get ready to roll.

27:23.617 --> 27:26.704
- Hour's almost up.
- Roger that, boss.

27:27.454 --> 27:31.041
You haven't fired your weapon,
so it's already clean.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.127
lt calms my mind.

27:33.335 --> 27:35.546
Forces me to stay focused
at the job in my hand.

27:37.506 --> 27:41.343
- The term's job at hand.
- Same difference.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.973
ls something wrong?

27:46.181 --> 27:47.641
Trying to picture you pregnant.

27:47.850 --> 27:49.727
- Don't.
- l have to.

27:49.977 --> 27:51.145
l'm gonna be a father.

27:52.187 --> 27:54.565
lt's a great responsibility.

27:54.815 --> 27:58.027
- Maybe it's not yours.
- Maybe she didn't know.

27:58.235 --> 27:59.570
Oh, she knew.

27:59.737 --> 28:04.158
So why take this contract,
put our unborn child in danger?

28:04.366 --> 28:06.035
Perhaps we needed the money.

28:06.243 --> 28:09.997
- Kids are expensive.
- Bullets are cheap.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.541
There's a big chance this meeting
is a setup, Tony.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.210
Are you scared?

28:15.461 --> 28:18.756
Nope. Excited.

28:19.381 --> 28:22.259
<i>- No sign of the Lincoln yet.
- That's a solid copy, McGee.</i>

28:22.509 --> 28:24.595
We're sending them down.
All mobile units,

28:24.762 --> 28:26.597
prepare to roll on my mark.

28:31.727 --> 28:35.564
This reminds me of our op
in the former Czech Republic.

28:36.106 --> 28:38.776
You took a round in the thigh.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.929
l had the same bad feeling
before that op too.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.181
We're on our way to the elevator,
boss.

28:44.890 --> 28:48.144
Tony, Ziva. We're not taking
any chances on this one.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.271
First sign it goes bad, you call it.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.065
Hold the door.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.693
- Thanks.
- Sure.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.862
Sweetheart.

28:58.446 --> 29:02.033
- Okay, black Lincoln just pulled up.
- Yeah, l got a visual on that, McGee.

29:07.288 --> 29:10.416
l got a match. Abby.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.171
A man and a woman just got out.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.464
Heading into the hotel.

29:16.714 --> 29:19.633
<i>- Car's leaving.
- l can see that, McGee.</i>

29:19.800 --> 29:22.636
- All units, hold your positions.
- That's not our Lincoln.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.805
- The waiter's got a warrant on him.
- For what?

29:24.972 --> 29:26.474
Murder.

29:52.585 --> 29:53.586
You're getting off here.

29:54.211 --> 29:57.506
Not a wise choice,
Mr. and Mrs. Ranier.

29:59.508 --> 30:00.843
Weapons.

30:01.093 --> 30:03.220
We would have come
to the third floor ourselves.

30:03.429 --> 30:05.639
Three armed escorts
seems a bit excessive.

30:05.848 --> 30:07.516
Very good.

30:07.725 --> 30:11.145
Our location
and our number in two sentences.

30:11.353 --> 30:13.564
lt's too bad
your friends can't hear you.

30:13.814 --> 30:16.984
- You're being jammed.
- Bring them to my room.

30:17.193 --> 30:18.944
lf they resist...

30:20.738 --> 30:21.989
...shoot the woman.

30:23.991 --> 30:26.452
Come on, let's go.

30:26.827 --> 30:29.038
Tony, Ziva, do you copy?

30:29.538 --> 30:32.541
DiNozzo. l said, do you copy?

30:33.501 --> 30:35.836
McGee.
What the hell is going on there?

30:36.462 --> 30:39.965
<i>Boss, they're not in their room.
They never arrived in the lobby.</i>

30:40.174 --> 30:43.552
My teams have the entire outside
covered. They didn't leave the hotel.

30:43.719 --> 30:47.056
Last contact was at the elevator. That's
1 1 floors they could've gotten off at.

30:47.306 --> 30:50.059
Eleven floors, McGee.
How many rooms are we looking at?

30:50.267 --> 30:53.312
<i>Well, if we don't count
individual bathrooms</i>

30:53.521 --> 30:55.022
<i>- and closets--
- McGee.</i>

30:55.231 --> 30:57.691
<i>Two hundred and sixty-four
hotel rooms, 22 utility rooms.</i>

30:57.900 --> 30:59.652
They haven't checked in
because they can't.

30:59.819 --> 31:01.278
They're at the meet right now?

31:01.487 --> 31:04.532
They removed their earwigs
and they dumped their comm

31:04.698 --> 31:07.034
- when it was changed to the hotel.
- We go room by room.

31:07.243 --> 31:10.329
- My people seal off the exterior.
- No. We wait.

31:10.538 --> 31:12.915
- What for?
- For Ziva to contact us.

31:13.165 --> 31:14.667
We move now, we blow their cover.

31:15.876 --> 31:17.878
And if their cover is already blown,
director?

31:23.425 --> 31:25.344
There are two things

31:25.553 --> 31:27.847
you should be painfully aware of
right now.

31:28.848 --> 31:30.432
One,

31:31.183 --> 31:32.935
no one leaves this business.

31:34.562 --> 31:35.813
And two,

31:36.021 --> 31:38.107
never threaten the people
who employ you.

31:38.315 --> 31:39.817
Should l be writing this down?

31:42.611 --> 31:44.405
l take that as a no.

31:45.281 --> 31:48.284
- Where is the disk?
- What disk?

31:51.704 --> 31:53.455
Where, Mrs. Ranier?

31:54.248 --> 31:55.916
What makes you think we have it?

31:56.125 --> 31:58.586
We spotted your backup
at the restaurant.

31:58.878 --> 32:01.088
On some level, you must've known
this was gonna happen.

32:01.338 --> 32:04.133
Observant.

32:04.383 --> 32:07.303
How much is our disk worth to you?

32:11.891 --> 32:13.767
l have a better question.

32:17.938 --> 32:21.358
- What's it worth to you?
- lt's bad, Gibbs. lt's very, very bad.

32:21.609 --> 32:24.069
Remember when we missed
nabbing the guy in the restaurant?

32:24.320 --> 32:25.905
Tony said he didn't see anything.

32:26.071 --> 32:29.408
But the eye sees more than we think it
does. lt's the brain that misses stuff.

32:29.575 --> 32:33.078
lt has to do with the firing of the
optic nerve and the visual cortex's--

32:33.287 --> 32:34.872
You found something
from Tony's camera.

32:35.039 --> 32:36.582
l went through the feed
frame by frame.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.626
Tony is looking at the pay phone

32:38.792 --> 32:40.669
because that's where he thinks
the target is.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.005
But a camera doesn't think.
lt just records.

32:43.255 --> 32:48.636
So when he runs past the kitchen door
of the restaurant, he got this.

32:49.303 --> 32:52.973
- Our bad guy. Run it. l want a name.
- l do. l did.

32:56.602 --> 33:00.439
Marcos Siazon.
He's a contract assassin, Gibbs.

33:00.648 --> 33:02.274
He's wanted
in more than five countries.

33:02.483 --> 33:03.901
lt doesn't make any sense.

33:04.109 --> 33:07.613
Why would a killer hire other killers
to do a hit for him?

33:10.699 --> 33:12.993
Out of professional courtesy

33:13.285 --> 33:15.955
l've had Mr. Cord
go lightly on your husband.

33:16.664 --> 33:18.624
And l appreciate that.

33:19.834 --> 33:22.002
Unfortunately,
we're running out of time.

33:22.628 --> 33:25.005
lf you let him go,
l'll tell you where the disk is.

33:27.132 --> 33:29.510
You'll tell me either way,
Mrs. Ranier.

33:38.227 --> 33:40.354
Why don't you two take a moment.

33:42.064 --> 33:43.858
Consider your options.

33:50.573 --> 33:52.366
- l might have a plan.
- What?

33:52.575 --> 33:54.493
The Raniers obviously stole something
they want.

33:54.660 --> 33:57.121
- You're gonna give it to them.
- We don't have it.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.165
You're gonna tell them
it's in our hotel room.

33:59.373 --> 34:01.417
The only way they'll find it
is if you show them.

34:01.584 --> 34:04.378
McGee should be waiting for us
in there.

34:04.545 --> 34:07.840
Good plan,
except for one minor drawback.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.132
What?

34:09.382 --> 34:13.929
When l leave, they'll most likely
put a bullet through your head.

34:14.096 --> 34:19.476
Oh, well, l didn't say
it was a perfect plan.

34:23.938 --> 34:28.569
Two centimetres below
the supraorbital notch.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.571
What do you make of it,
Mr. Palmer?

34:30.779 --> 34:34.408
l originally assumed
it was a spec of dirt on the exposure.

34:34.617 --> 34:37.995
- lt appears to be a heart?
- Yes.

34:38.746 --> 34:40.789
A strange place to find one.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.917
Don't you agree?

34:43.125 --> 34:45.335
lt appears to be gold,
surgically embedded

34:45.543 --> 34:47.463
in the conjunctival layer.

34:47.630 --> 34:50.007
Perhaps some type of body jewellery.

34:50.216 --> 34:52.510
Jewellery embedded in an eye.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.513
Oh, yes. You'd be amazed
what people do to themselves.

34:56.764 --> 34:58.807
To Abby, please.

35:00.643 --> 35:02.853
You know,
l doubt anyone would notice

35:03.103 --> 35:06.857
your little gold heart
unless they knew it was there.

35:07.107 --> 35:11.320
Staring into your eyes,
face to face

35:11.821 --> 35:13.906
like a lover.

35:16.659 --> 35:17.660
l found a chip in it.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.537
Flash memory
embedded underneath, sir.

35:19.745 --> 35:22.540
Five hundred megabyte capacity.
Fifty MPS throughout.

35:24.166 --> 35:28.462
Translation, it contains
the Raniers' personal data in two files.

35:28.671 --> 35:30.673
One has a list
of numbered bank accounts,

35:30.840 --> 35:33.551
a deed for a restaurant,
a house in Gilead, Maine.

35:33.759 --> 35:34.844
We also ran the address.

35:35.010 --> 35:37.763
The phone service and cable are
scheduled to be turned on next week.

35:37.972 --> 35:39.348
Sounds like a retirement plan.

35:39.557 --> 35:41.183
She was pregnant.
They were getting out.

35:41.350 --> 35:43.894
- What about the other file?
- lt has a list of their clients.

35:44.144 --> 35:46.981
Their names, addresses, phone
numbers, all their information.

35:47.189 --> 35:49.483
- lnsurance policy?
- Their ticket out.

35:49.692 --> 35:52.987
- They weren't hired to make a hit.
- They are the hit.

35:53.195 --> 35:55.197
Did you know

35:55.364 --> 35:58.200
the Peruvians make blades
so sharp

35:58.450 --> 36:01.370
some people can't even feel
the initial incision?

36:01.579 --> 36:03.372
Stop.

36:03.622 --> 36:05.207
- The disk's in our hotel room.
- Don't.

36:05.457 --> 36:06.876
- He'll only use it--
- Where?

36:07.626 --> 36:08.878
She has to show you.

36:09.670 --> 36:11.380
Not what l asked.

36:11.589 --> 36:14.216
You'll never find it without her

36:15.301 --> 36:16.802
even if you kill us.

36:20.014 --> 36:22.308
Untie her.

36:28.898 --> 36:30.733
- l'm in position.
- Clear the room.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.903
- l'm on my way up with the girl.
- My pleasure.

36:53.756 --> 36:57.843
Your only mistake
was going for one last big payday.

36:58.844 --> 37:01.889
- You got greedy.
- l'm pregnant.

37:02.264 --> 37:03.933
Really?

37:05.142 --> 37:07.269
Congratulations.

37:07.853 --> 37:09.021
Boy or girl?

37:09.271 --> 37:11.023
l don't know.

37:11.732 --> 37:12.983
We want to be surprised.

37:13.776 --> 37:16.904
lt's the best way, believe me.

37:17.905 --> 37:19.281
- How many months?
- Three.

37:21.450 --> 37:24.245
- Morning sickness?
- Only every single day.

37:25.037 --> 37:27.414
l hated to see my wife go through it.

37:28.666 --> 37:32.711
But believe me,
it's all worth it in the end.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.756
So you're not going to kill us?

37:36.590 --> 37:38.759
We're assassins.

37:39.552 --> 37:43.722
You know we can't just walk away
from the game when we feel like it.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.599
Hell, don't you think

37:45.766 --> 37:49.436
l'd rather be at
my daughter's 5th birthday than here?

37:49.728 --> 37:52.690
So you are going to kill us? Right?

37:55.734 --> 37:57.945
l haven't decided yet.

37:58.779 --> 38:03.159
Give me the disk
and we'll see, play it by ear.

38:05.578 --> 38:07.496
lf l'm not back in five minutes,

38:09.248 --> 38:10.708
kill him.

38:17.339 --> 38:21.468
That was purely
for your wife's cooperation.

38:25.347 --> 38:27.975
We like to call them ''little white lies.''

38:38.152 --> 38:39.403
Open it.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.629
l hope you weren't counting
on your backup, Mrs. Ranier.

38:57.546 --> 38:58.714
He's not my backup.

39:02.676 --> 39:05.221
- Tony?
- Third floor, room 356.

39:07.014 --> 39:09.058
All teams, third floor, room 356.

39:09.225 --> 39:11.060
<i>- Federal agent in distress.
- We're moving.</i>

39:11.268 --> 39:13.229
You know what's funny?

39:13.395 --> 39:16.357
l was really looking forward
to having a kid there for a minute.

39:17.149 --> 39:18.651
That's a big step for me.

39:18.859 --> 39:21.028
Having a little DiNozzo
running around.

39:21.821 --> 39:23.572
DiNozzo?

39:23.823 --> 39:28.619
Yeah, that's my full name.
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, NClS.

39:36.252 --> 39:37.336
How does that feel, huh?

39:38.546 --> 39:40.339
Huh, big guy?

39:40.548 --> 39:42.591
- Enough.
- You want to punch me again?

39:42.758 --> 39:46.011
- Come on.
- Enough, enough, Tony.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.930
l think you made your point.

39:49.765 --> 39:51.100
l want a divorce.

39:55.855 --> 39:58.858
The emergency room
seems to have done a pretty good job.

39:59.066 --> 40:02.570
- How do you feel?
- Better, now that l can breath.

40:02.820 --> 40:05.197
There doesn't appear
to be any permanent damage.

40:05.447 --> 40:07.032
How many times did he hit you?

40:07.241 --> 40:09.410
- l wasn't counting.
- Seven times.

40:09.618 --> 40:11.996
- She was, of course.
- lt was hard not to.

40:12.163 --> 40:13.789
We're gonna take good care of you,
Tony.

40:13.956 --> 40:16.083
l had Chip pull your car
right around front.

40:17.126 --> 40:19.587
- He drove my car?
- Just from your parking space.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.630
l took extra special care.

40:21.839 --> 40:23.966
Oh, thanks.

40:25.134 --> 40:27.595
- And l'm driving you home.
- Probie.

40:28.637 --> 40:31.640
Ziva, actually you shouldn't
probably drive him home tonight.

40:32.474 --> 40:35.144
- Why's that?
- Maybe he wants to live.

40:35.352 --> 40:39.648
Yes, well, however, you get home,
l suggest a couple of aspirin,

40:40.900 --> 40:42.776
yes, and perhaps some Scotch.

40:42.985 --> 40:46.113
l thought doctors weren't supposed
to prescribe alcohol anymore, Duck.

40:46.322 --> 40:48.657
Well, it always seems to work
for you.

40:48.866 --> 40:51.118
Did you get tickets
to that gazelle thing again?

40:51.327 --> 40:53.996
<i>lt's Giselle, Jethro.
And no, that's not tonight.</i>

40:55.164 --> 40:56.665
Marine Corps Birthday Ball.

40:58.417 --> 40:59.793
She didn't tell you?

41:04.006 --> 41:08.177
Our lovely director
has asked me to escort her.

41:28.113 --> 41:30.658
- All right.
- Good night, boss.

41:31.033 --> 41:33.911
All right, l'm good.

41:39.708 --> 41:41.710
Hey, Gibbs.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.170
Happy birthday.

42:04.483 --> 42:06.861
l miss you guys.

42:12.241 --> 42:14.326
<i>Semper Fi.</i>
