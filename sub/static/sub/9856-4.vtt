01:15.507 --> 01:16.587
Are you serious, mate?

01:16.840 --> 01:18.347
Bit early for a game, isn't it?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.690
Where the hell are they playing anyway?

01:20.810 --> 01:22.276
Japan. Tokyo.

01:22.396 --> 01:24.587
Asia? Not even football?

01:25.017 --> 01:27.547
- Game's a game, right?
- Not even close.

01:29.206 --> 01:30.707
Where is Major Daniel?

01:31.718 --> 01:34.467
Uh, I don't know. Maybe he's still at home.

01:34.587 --> 01:37.448
No, he's not there, and
he's not on his cell.

01:38.907 --> 01:40.298
May we have a word?

01:41.022 --> 01:43.562
- Sure.
- No, Sebastian.

01:43.883 --> 01:44.947
Alone.

01:45.304 --> 01:47.668
Oh, right. Sorry.

01:52.124 --> 01:53.663
Something wrong, sir?

01:53.664 --> 01:56.533
I received an anonymous correspondence.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.508
About?

01:57.533 --> 02:00.668
Type "ICC scandal" into your computer.

02:00.678 --> 02:02.328
The story just broke.

02:02.832 --> 02:06.548
We've traced it back to a source
within the Italian Police Services.

02:07.855 --> 02:09.068
Italian?

02:09.187 --> 02:12.283
It will be in all the
European newspapers tomorrow.

02:12.403 --> 02:14.511
- Do you have it?
- Yup.

02:18.172 --> 02:21.014
"... Severe misconduct of a
recently established unit...

02:21.050 --> 02:23.058
at the International
Criminal Court in The Hague.

02:23.178 --> 02:27.787
The tech expert of the team,
Kriminalkommissar Sebastian Berger,

02:27.788 --> 02:31.656
- hacked into numerous..."
- "European police databases."

02:33.911 --> 02:38.268
Yeah, but I only collected data
which was relevant to our cases...

02:38.388 --> 02:40.988
when there was no time to
go through official channels.

02:41.722 --> 02:43.968
Yeah, and I'm sure that's true,

02:44.088 --> 02:46.206
and I will deal with that

02:46.407 --> 02:49.442
at the appropriate diplomatic level.

02:50.202 --> 02:53.631
If that were the extent of
it, I would not be concerned...

02:55.263 --> 02:58.151
It's very early for a football match.

02:58.490 --> 03:00.443
The game must be important.

03:00.468 --> 03:03.853
It's only on while I update my
files. I was barely even watching.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.171
Do you have a gambling problem?

03:07.291 --> 03:10.268
I don't have... no, I don't have a problem.

03:15.284 --> 03:17.668
I used to, but I've given it up.

03:17.788 --> 03:18.639
When?

03:18.759 --> 03:20.548
- When?
- When did you give it up?

03:21.124 --> 03:23.470
Before you came to the ICC,

03:23.498 --> 03:25.881
or did you gamble from these offices?

03:26.807 --> 03:30.346
- I don't see how it matters when...
- 30,000 Euro!

03:32.124 --> 03:33.188
Excuse me?

03:33.793 --> 03:36.919
I was also copied with
a transcript of files...

03:37.185 --> 03:40.008
that show that you owed a gambling debt

03:40.128 --> 03:42.043
of 30,000 Euro,

03:42.388 --> 03:45.783
which you cleared with a single payment.

03:46.672 --> 03:48.515
Where did you get the money?

03:49.111 --> 03:50.111
I...

03:52.494 --> 03:53.548
That's...

03:54.236 --> 03:55.483
It's personal.

03:55.492 --> 03:57.408
That is your answer?

03:57.793 --> 03:59.131
Not a whiff

03:59.150 --> 04:03.283
of corruption must touch this court or the
vital work that is done in these offices.

04:03.403 --> 04:05.869
Not the slightest smell of it.

04:07.712 --> 04:11.663
And an investigator making
the salary that you make

04:11.708 --> 04:16.302
who suddenly has 30,000 Euro to
pay off an illegal gambling debt...

04:16.308 --> 04:17.741
is not a whiff.

04:17.861 --> 04:20.161
That stinks to high heaven.

04:21.050 --> 04:23.992
That is why "when" matters.

04:24.441 --> 04:27.428
- Yeah, but...
- Kommissar Berger,

04:27.458 --> 04:29.457
you are hereby informed

04:29.768 --> 04:34.049
that you are under an internal
investigation by the ICC

04:34.352 --> 04:38.643
into bribery, corruption,
extortion, illegal gambling,

04:38.763 --> 04:42.468
and your activities are
restricted to these offices.

04:42.502 --> 04:45.069
You are not to leave, do you understand?

04:46.572 --> 04:47.788
Yeah.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.281
—

05:11.162 --> 05:14.810
EVERY IS GOING TO KNOW, STEFAN

05:47.235 --> 05:50.343
Crooked. It's just crooked!

05:50.554 --> 05:53.845
- You cannot mean that.
- I most certainly do, Rebecca.

05:53.868 --> 05:57.373
We have an obligation to protect
the Court, to protect its integrity.

05:57.388 --> 05:59.828
- Michel, the Court is stronger than...
- No!

05:59.841 --> 06:01.684
I asked those judges

06:01.693 --> 06:04.370
to trust me with this idea
of Louis, and they did,

06:04.388 --> 06:06.414
and now the trust that they've placed in me

06:06.560 --> 06:10.951
has put their reputation in jeopardy,
the reputation of this entire body!

06:12.068 --> 06:16.397
Whether we like or not, the team
is the public face of the ICC.

06:17.028 --> 06:20.035
Oh, dammit. I have to go to Serbia.

06:20.402 --> 06:23.097
I'll be back at the
end of the day tomorrow.

06:23.748 --> 06:26.003
I want you to monitor the investigation.

06:26.049 --> 06:29.661
If you suspect that Berger has
done anything even remotely illegal,

06:29.680 --> 06:32.494
- I want to know about it immediately.
- To prosecute him?

06:32.508 --> 06:35.024
To the fullest extent of the law.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.387
All right, two minutes.

06:40.588 --> 06:41.988
I told you, you don't need to.

06:42.108 --> 06:43.981
And I told you I want to.

06:44.788 --> 06:47.272
- More coffee?
- I can get it.

07:00.308 --> 07:01.638
All right, here we go.

07:02.023 --> 07:04.059
Bacon, eggs, and toast.

07:04.988 --> 07:07.230
All-American breakfast, coming up.

07:11.958 --> 07:14.149
Come on, just a couple bites.

07:20.619 --> 07:21.793
The doctor...

07:21.838 --> 07:25.304
- the doctor told me to tell him if your appetite...
- My appetite is fine.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.588
I'm sorry.

07:31.171 --> 07:33.087
You need to go to work.

07:36.628 --> 07:37.943
I guess I do.

07:39.694 --> 07:41.271
I do, I'm sorry.

07:42.124 --> 07:43.911
What time will you be...

07:45.396 --> 07:46.548
finished?

07:46.890 --> 07:48.054
Late.

07:48.348 --> 07:50.520
I have an appointment with a...

07:51.043 --> 07:53.188
a realtor, a listing agent.

07:53.628 --> 07:55.820
I'm thinking of renting a flat.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.228
Like a real, permanent flat?

07:58.348 --> 08:00.293
More permanent than this.

08:04.857 --> 08:06.718
A flat sounds nice.

08:07.479 --> 08:08.748
Yeah.

08:17.908 --> 08:19.375
Hiya, Seeger.

08:21.348 --> 08:22.501
What are you looking at me like that for?

08:22.508 --> 08:23.868
You haven't read the papers?

08:23.988 --> 08:26.975
Papers? Who wants to read a load
of shite first thing in the...?

08:29.717 --> 08:32.687
- What? Where is he?
- In his lab with Eva.

08:33.823 --> 08:34.804
Tommy, wait.

08:34.828 --> 08:37.041
- You haven't read the whole thing.
- Whatever!

08:37.371 --> 08:39.467
Well, they can't say that you're corrupt.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.590
I told them.

08:40.710 --> 08:43.028
- They weren't convinced.
- Convinced of what?

08:43.643 --> 08:46.851
- Sebastian is up on a corruption charge.
- Because of this shite?

08:46.971 --> 08:48.348
It's my own fault.

08:48.391 --> 08:50.048
Why are you biting the bullet on this?

08:50.148 --> 08:51.664
Everything you did was sanctioned.

08:51.691 --> 08:53.308
The Major knew you were
going into those files.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.376
I don't remember him
worrying about it back then.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.268
The databases aren't the problem.

08:57.292 --> 08:59.144
I told you, you didn't
read the whole article.

08:59.188 --> 09:01.500
He was gambling, too. At work.

09:01.839 --> 09:03.764
Sorry, Sebastian.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.946
How did they find out?

09:06.239 --> 09:09.828
I kept the records. All my
wins, all my losses. Stupid.

09:10.438 --> 09:12.198
I created this mess.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.536
What are you going on about?

09:13.788 --> 09:16.108
I told my former colleagues
about his hacking.

09:16.308 --> 09:18.321
- You did what?
- Tommy,

09:18.358 --> 09:19.924
- it's all right.
- Why the hell would you do that?

09:19.948 --> 09:21.925
Because I wanted to make sure
they did a security check.

09:21.948 --> 09:24.537
That's even stupider than him
keeping the files in his computer!

09:24.565 --> 09:26.591
- Can you lower your voice, please?
- Please, guys!

09:26.637 --> 09:28.782
Let's let everyone else fight about this.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.404
I've got enough without
that on my conscience.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.043
What if they kick you out?

09:34.163 --> 09:35.748
- They wouldn't do that.
- Wouldn't they?

09:35.767 --> 09:36.912
What the hell would we do then?

09:36.922 --> 09:38.461
We use that damned ScanGen for everything.

09:38.462 --> 09:40.139
Well, I can show you how to use it.

09:40.148 --> 09:41.444
Yeah, as if I'd ever be able to...

09:41.468 --> 09:44.142
- No, no, no, I meant Arabela and...
- Yeah, well, they might be able to...

09:44.166 --> 09:45.321
Where would you go?

09:46.268 --> 09:47.108
Home, I guess.

09:47.268 --> 09:49.548
- What do you mean, you'd go home?
- Berlin.

09:50.304 --> 09:51.683
You already know?

09:52.988 --> 09:54.191
Kathrin?

09:55.063 --> 09:56.340
Know what?

09:56.628 --> 09:58.239
That I need your help in Berlin?

09:58.444 --> 10:01.986
Let me get this straight. You want
us take a look at these suicides?

10:02.106 --> 10:04.348
Last night was the third this month.

10:04.385 --> 10:06.228
Two in Berlin, one in Munich.

10:06.348 --> 10:08.961
All young adults who seemingly
had everything to live for.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.748
A gifted student scientist
already being honored for his work.

10:11.868 --> 10:14.153
A musician on the brink
of recording an album.

10:14.161 --> 10:17.240
And last night, Amélie Weurfel,

10:17.526 --> 10:21.185
a girl who graduated with honors
on her way to a major university.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.750
By all accounts, the most
popular girl in her school.

10:25.329 --> 10:26.329
Well,

10:27.449 --> 10:30.939
she jumped 40 meters from a
rooftop to an asphalt car park.

10:30.940 --> 10:33.521
Suicide does not fall under our mandate.

10:33.719 --> 10:36.668
Normally, I would agree. This isn't normal.

10:36.697 --> 10:38.524
Are you saying you think
they were all murdered?

10:38.548 --> 10:40.592
Every indication is that they were all

10:40.614 --> 10:42.433
physically alone at
the time of their death.

10:42.689 --> 10:44.156
Physically alone?

10:45.652 --> 10:47.368
This is Amélie's phone.

10:47.896 --> 10:50.705
It was recovered at the scene,
but wasn't found near her.

10:50.825 --> 10:53.653
It appears she threw it before
she jumped from that roof.

10:53.683 --> 10:54.959
We processed it.

10:55.079 --> 10:57.228
The circuitry inside has been...

10:57.348 --> 10:58.348
fried.

10:58.604 --> 10:59.887
Remotely.

11:00.228 --> 11:01.597
Is that even possible?

11:04.281 --> 11:05.548
Yeah.

11:05.668 --> 11:08.374
So you think it was working
when she went up there.

11:08.494 --> 11:11.073
And after, someone erased what was on it.

11:11.193 --> 11:14.806
All three victims had phones at
the scenes, all fried the same way.

11:15.268 --> 11:18.107
I believe someone is using the
internet to influence these kids

11:18.136 --> 11:19.515
into killing themselves.

11:19.559 --> 11:22.308
The time between suicides is
getting shorter with each one.

11:22.324 --> 11:24.260
Only four days between the last two.

11:24.986 --> 11:26.372
If I'm right,

11:26.492 --> 11:29.276
there may be someone out
there right now we could save.

11:29.658 --> 11:32.188
And they may not even know
yet that they need help.

11:39.434 --> 11:40.835
Come on...

11:43.739 --> 11:45.788
Naughty, naughty, Stefan.

11:45.983 --> 11:47.435
How did you get that video?

11:47.780 --> 11:49.228
Very naughty.

11:49.554 --> 11:51.548
But you must have hacked me.

11:51.828 --> 11:54.138
That video, it's not what you...

11:54.570 --> 11:56.199
It isn't what it looks like!

11:56.228 --> 11:58.068
Then you won't mind it going public?

11:58.090 --> 12:00.987
You can't show this to anyone! Please!

12:01.024 --> 12:03.011
I'm going to show everyone.

12:03.062 --> 12:05.057
Everyone will know.

12:11.759 --> 12:12.868
Please...

12:28.202 --> 12:30.827
There is a phenomenon
called "Cluster Suicides"...

12:30.857 --> 12:33.966
when people belong to the
same group. Could this be that?

12:34.025 --> 12:36.555
We looked for a connection,
there's nothing on the surface.

12:36.826 --> 12:38.271
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:38.278 --> 12:40.368
Different schools, different social groups.

12:40.405 --> 12:44.094
All they had in common is they were
successful and had a lot of friends.

12:44.277 --> 12:46.338
Doesn't sound much like typical suicides.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.216
I have the case files in my office.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.563
Is he all right?

12:50.600 --> 12:51.685
Who?

12:51.722 --> 12:53.724
I saw the paper on the way here.

12:54.861 --> 12:55.861
Yeah.

12:56.130 --> 12:58.228
He's actually fine.

12:58.587 --> 13:01.198
He's not as concerned as you'd think.

13:01.318 --> 13:04.271
Yes. That sounds like Sebastian.

13:04.630 --> 13:07.615
There are definitely files
removed. Destroyed, really.

13:07.637 --> 13:08.957
Like a bomb went off inside.

13:08.986 --> 13:10.496
There's a fragment of a trail,

13:10.616 --> 13:12.220
but I need a full IP, and

13:12.264 --> 13:13.935
the target device to trace it back.

13:14.442 --> 13:16.297
Then could you restore the files?

13:17.309 --> 13:18.375
Maybe.

13:19.172 --> 13:20.255
Why should he?

13:20.874 --> 13:21.855
Why should he what?

13:21.878 --> 13:23.935
Why should he do anything for the ICC?

13:24.306 --> 13:25.855
Because it's his job.

13:26.242 --> 13:28.135
Do you not know what's going on here, man?

13:28.255 --> 13:30.269
I know that he's being investigated, yeah.

13:30.306 --> 13:32.020
They're trying to screw
him is what they're doing.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.054
Tommy, stay out of this.

13:34.174 --> 13:35.815
Are you corrupt, Sebastian?

13:35.858 --> 13:37.956
Did you take a bribe to pay off the debt?

13:38.425 --> 13:39.655
A bribe?

13:39.775 --> 13:41.109
He paid off a very large debt,

13:41.116 --> 13:42.852
and they'd like to know
where the money came from.

13:42.876 --> 13:44.291
How large?

13:44.797 --> 13:47.170
- 30,000.
- 30,000?

13:47.290 --> 13:48.794
Where the hell did you get the money?

13:48.823 --> 13:52.615
Look, I didn't get it illegally,
and, no, I never took a bribe.

13:52.637 --> 13:55.578
Then let them investigate. A good
cop gets investigated all the time.

13:55.608 --> 13:56.810
I had a boss

13:56.930 --> 13:59.553
who used to get rid of anyone
didn't have an Internal Affairs beef

13:59.567 --> 14:00.975
- at least once a year.
- And?

14:00.990 --> 14:02.823
What's he supposed to do?

14:03.527 --> 14:05.096
What I didn't do

14:05.507 --> 14:07.854
was to take it out on
potential murder victims.

14:07.876 --> 14:10.251
Look, are you going to tell
them where the money came from?

14:11.286 --> 14:12.855
I don't think they have a right to ask.

14:12.892 --> 14:14.655
Then that's your decision. Live with it.

14:14.674 --> 14:16.331
And until they tell you you can't,

14:16.353 --> 14:17.585
you do your job.

14:20.271 --> 14:21.775
For them.

14:26.801 --> 14:29.891
The team will only do background
investigations on the victims

14:29.900 --> 14:31.596
until I get your call.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.135
Yes, Dorn. Thank you.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.535
Hello, my love.

14:45.256 --> 14:47.175
- You have a new case?
- Yes.

14:47.181 --> 14:49.114
Someone may be using the internet

14:49.115 --> 14:51.434
to convince people to commit suicide.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.775
That's awful.

14:56.118 --> 14:57.961
- Where?
- In Germany.

14:58.007 --> 15:00.849
I'm fairly certain suicide
isn't a crime in Germany.

15:00.969 --> 15:04.369
We're not going after the victims,
only the one convincing them.

15:04.489 --> 15:07.852
But can inducing someone to
do something that isn't a crime

15:07.972 --> 15:10.740
- be a crime?
- In this case, it should be.

15:10.768 --> 15:12.675
I'll research it back at my office.

15:12.795 --> 15:14.655
Thank you. So now...

15:15.947 --> 15:19.095
- what can I do for you?
- I came to warn you.

15:19.215 --> 15:21.392
Michel told me about Sebastian Berger.

15:21.512 --> 15:24.426
- He wants him prosecuted.
- No, he does not.

15:24.435 --> 15:25.948
Louis, he was very clear.

15:25.957 --> 15:27.689
He wants the Court protected.

15:27.707 --> 15:29.655
That's a very different thing.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.814
Well, if your Sebastian did anything wrong,

15:31.841 --> 15:33.574
there will be a prosecution.

15:33.973 --> 15:36.267
I don't believe he did
what it looks like he did.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.797
So it's nothing then?

15:39.199 --> 15:40.748
I did not say that.

15:41.701 --> 15:44.708
Sir? Sorry. I'm sorry to bother.

15:44.717 --> 15:46.633
- No, I was leaving.
- Sorry.

15:46.872 --> 15:49.265
- Thank you.
- Well, Eva.

15:49.283 --> 15:50.508
Yeah.

15:50.628 --> 15:51.828
What do you need?

15:51.831 --> 15:55.150
Well, we've done all we can
here, so Arabela and I thought

15:55.187 --> 15:57.405
we might go to Berlin and
see what we can find there.

15:57.433 --> 15:58.928
Let's hold any travel

15:59.048 --> 16:01.329
until Sebastian finishes his work.

16:01.449 --> 16:03.028
Yes, sir.

16:06.756 --> 16:08.672
- Sir?
- Yes.

16:10.350 --> 16:14.704
If the only problem is where Sebastian
got his money to pay his debt...

16:15.126 --> 16:16.588
I gave it to him.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.228
- You did?
- Yeah.

16:18.348 --> 16:20.874
I saved up money for a holiday.

16:21.278 --> 16:23.881
But Sebastian didn't tell me that?

16:24.340 --> 16:26.788
Well, I guess he didn't
want me to be involved.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.128
Should I make a statement?

16:29.135 --> 16:31.508
No. It won't be necessary right now.

16:32.535 --> 16:33.937
Sebastian found something.

16:33.965 --> 16:36.009
Among the items erased from the phone...

16:36.129 --> 16:38.833
was a series of photos and webcam videos.

16:40.171 --> 16:42.115
This is the jumper.

16:43.408 --> 16:46.433
- How long do we have?
- She won't be home for an hour.

16:46.442 --> 16:48.431
She was definitely waiting for him.

16:50.311 --> 16:51.952
Do they know they're being filmed?

16:52.153 --> 16:53.948
They don't act like it.

16:57.819 --> 16:59.268
Oh, my God.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.283
That's her mother's boyfriend.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.262
Sweetie, sweetie.

17:06.848 --> 17:09.433
I recovered more than 300 text messages

17:09.443 --> 17:11.608
threatening to send this
recording to everyone,

17:11.615 --> 17:13.723
her friends in school
and, of course, her mother.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.025
Last message was at 0722.

17:16.034 --> 17:18.828
Coroner estimated her death at 0720.

17:18.848 --> 17:20.672
He texted her while she was on the roof?

17:20.791 --> 17:23.907
- Didn't want her to change her mind.
- Which is why she threw the phone.

17:23.944 --> 17:25.925
She was harassed into killing herself.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.068
Can you identify who sent the texts?

17:28.098 --> 17:30.868
I can tell you the name,
but it's only a screen name.

17:31.087 --> 17:32.308
"Sensenmann".

17:32.351 --> 17:34.708
It's German. It means, "Grim Reaper".

17:34.828 --> 17:36.266
We are going to Berlin.

17:36.504 --> 17:37.567
What, me too?

17:37.595 --> 17:40.611
I doubt there's anyone
else who could solve this.

17:48.339 --> 17:49.769
- Hey!
- Hey, Sebastian!

17:49.889 --> 17:52.721
- How are you?
- Uh, not my desk any longer.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.534
- Wow, when?
- Last month.

17:58.654 --> 18:00.129
"Polizeihau" what?

18:00.148 --> 18:02.092
She's been made Chief Inspector.

18:02.212 --> 18:04.466
- Like a boss?
- Like the boss.

18:04.586 --> 18:07.546
- Congratulations, Chief Inspector.
- Thank you, Major Daniel.

18:07.666 --> 18:10.030
I need to call the au pair,
and then we can get started.

18:10.150 --> 18:13.010
- Oh, yeah. How is the little guy?
- Eric.

18:14.330 --> 18:15.834
Right. Eric.

18:16.090 --> 18:18.189
He's amazing. I'll be back.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.012
Now, Carl and Arabela,

18:21.031 --> 18:23.634
talk to the last victim's
mother and her friend?

18:23.754 --> 18:24.835
The creep?

18:24.955 --> 18:27.044
The witness. Don't make it personal.

18:29.065 --> 18:30.262
Sure.

18:30.757 --> 18:33.425
Tommy and Eva, go through
the other victim's files

18:33.461 --> 18:36.627
- and see if there is anything.
- All right.

18:37.771 --> 18:41.227
Yeah, I have the street address
of the IP that sent the video file.

18:41.505 --> 18:43.335
He needed a lot of bandwidth for that.

18:43.354 --> 18:45.454
It's from an internet
cafe not far from here.

18:45.465 --> 18:47.225
- I'll go with you.
- Can I go?

18:47.345 --> 18:49.323
It's a lead I should be part of.

18:49.543 --> 18:50.785
Please.

18:54.888 --> 18:56.225
Thank you.

19:05.137 --> 19:07.136
You're trying to make
me look good, aren't you?

19:07.256 --> 19:08.841
I'm expecting a call.

19:09.065 --> 19:12.059
You're lucky the scouts aren't
coming today instead of tomorrow.

19:16.887 --> 19:19.870
EVERYBODY WILL KNOW

19:21.367 --> 19:24.618
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS

19:25.292 --> 19:28.074
EVERYBODY WILL KNOW

19:39.681 --> 19:42.615
We're sorry to have to talk
to you at such a terrible time.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.880
You are from the ICC?

19:45.345 --> 19:46.985
The Criminal Court?

19:47.105 --> 19:50.894
- Yes. A special investigative unit.
- For suicide?

19:50.940 --> 19:54.213
- I asked you not to use that word.
- But she...

19:54.910 --> 19:56.816
Sorry, darling.

19:57.201 --> 20:00.505
We're interested in Amélie's acquaintances.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.463
Her friends?

20:02.683 --> 20:05.625
More people she might not
want to share secrets with.

20:06.025 --> 20:07.560
Secrets?

20:07.890 --> 20:09.815
What secrets does she have?

20:09.935 --> 20:12.025
We don't mean anything specific.

20:12.145 --> 20:15.141
You don't believe it was a suicide.

20:15.261 --> 20:17.185
We do believe she hurt herself.

20:17.222 --> 20:19.816
We're just trying to understand why.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.740
Could we speak alone for a moment?

20:24.070 --> 20:25.527
Why him?

20:26.517 --> 20:28.883
- He's not her father.
- I know.

20:29.003 --> 20:30.139
It's me.

20:30.345 --> 20:32.541
I'm the one that wants to be alone, Madame.

20:32.585 --> 20:36.254
I asked my partner to
occupy your... Mr. Keppel.

20:36.505 --> 20:38.637
- Why?
- So...

20:38.905 --> 20:42.111
we may speak freely as women, about Amélie.

20:42.148 --> 20:43.899
Maybe you could show me her room?

20:44.185 --> 20:46.347
- It might be helpful.
- Okay.

20:48.189 --> 20:49.738
This way.

20:53.745 --> 20:56.467
- You look tired.
- Ever tactful, Sebastian.

20:56.505 --> 21:00.354
- I don't mean it badly.
- So it's a good tired?

21:01.065 --> 21:03.505
Well, your new job must not be easy.

21:03.625 --> 21:07.826
Well, being responsible for all
the investigations is intense.

21:07.865 --> 21:09.421
More than I thought it would be.

21:09.825 --> 21:12.529
We have three open homicides,
two armed robbery patterns,

21:12.575 --> 21:16.004
and an unsolved home invasion
tied to a series of them in Essen,

21:16.334 --> 21:19.634
and I can't find a
single piece of evidence.

21:20.248 --> 21:22.531
And you still have time
to work these suicides?

21:22.545 --> 21:26.289
Well, everyone deserves to be considered.

21:32.074 --> 21:33.265
Let me ask you,

21:33.545 --> 21:34.586
did...

21:35.374 --> 21:37.639
Amélie have anyone who

21:37.684 --> 21:39.573
really didn't like her? I mean...

21:40.004 --> 21:42.945
- I mean, serious dislike.
- She was very popular.

21:45.356 --> 21:48.886
Look, I'm not passing judgment.
You're all consenting adults.

21:48.913 --> 21:52.131
It's kinda creepy, and a lot
shitty, but it's your life.

21:52.167 --> 21:53.345
I don't follow.

21:53.785 --> 21:55.468
Amélie was being harassed

21:55.504 --> 21:59.245
by someone who hacked into
her webcam on her laptop.

21:59.365 --> 22:00.904
They took videos.

22:01.105 --> 22:03.911
Recorded what was happening,
and then threatened to expose her

22:03.945 --> 22:07.340
by making the videos
public. It's why she...

22:08.193 --> 22:09.806
hurt herself.

22:10.118 --> 22:13.419
Expose her? What was there to expose?

22:13.425 --> 22:15.945
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

22:16.065 --> 22:17.905
They remotely controlled...

22:18.025 --> 22:22.625
the camera in her laptop and recorded
what was happening in front of it.

22:22.745 --> 22:24.869
And where was her laptop kept?

22:30.003 --> 22:31.265
Oh, no.

22:33.905 --> 22:35.567
Oh, no...

22:36.631 --> 22:37.825
It wasn't...

22:38.705 --> 22:42.324
Did she know someone who would
threaten to make those videos public?

22:42.444 --> 22:45.588
- Your... The other cop, is she...
- No.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.850
She is not telling
Amélie's mother any of this.

22:50.065 --> 22:52.305
God knows she's had a rough enough time.

22:52.425 --> 22:54.516
I'm going to take that laptop.

22:55.268 --> 22:57.615
We'll have someone analyze it.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.420
We... we didn't...

23:01.438 --> 23:02.878
It was only...

23:02.998 --> 23:05.425
We... we loved each other.

23:05.435 --> 23:07.287
I don't really care, pal.

23:07.507 --> 23:09.772
You're the one that has
to look in the mirror.

23:17.313 --> 23:20.045
The videos were definitely sent from here.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.951
Would they have to know each other?

23:23.345 --> 23:24.793
Not at all.

23:25.609 --> 23:29.047
How would the person sending
the file know where to send it?

23:29.322 --> 23:32.640
Well, every person in here
on a device is broadcasting

23:32.665 --> 23:34.464
their personal information.

23:34.665 --> 23:37.059
It's there for the taking,
if you know where to look.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.580
And where is that?

23:40.827 --> 23:42.545
There's a server inside this cafe.

23:43.025 --> 23:45.805
It's providing the Wi-Fi
everybody is attached to.

23:46.226 --> 23:48.385
But your device has to talk to it,

23:48.505 --> 23:50.719
making your unique identity
vulnerable to anyone

23:50.745 --> 23:52.345
who can hack into that Wi-Fi.

23:52.465 --> 23:53.871
Is it hard to do?

23:53.991 --> 23:55.760
I just did it.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.014
With a proper laptop, you can
gather everyone's passwords,

24:00.025 --> 24:01.893
log-in's, personal information...

24:02.013 --> 24:04.029
That's what got you in the paper.

24:05.101 --> 24:07.026
But not what got me in trouble.

24:07.558 --> 24:09.904
Come on, I have enough to trace the sender.

24:09.905 --> 24:11.133
Already?

24:11.867 --> 24:13.535
I'm not just pretty.

24:15.029 --> 24:17.917
Yes, Dorn, I will let
you know what we find.

24:18.037 --> 24:19.906
Sebastian is here.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.465
Because we need him here.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.905
Yes, I'm sure.

24:25.187 --> 24:26.465
Thank you very much, Dorn.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.025
Yes?

24:28.145 --> 24:30.853
Sorry, I was just waiting
for you to get off.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.520
Dorn got the authorization to look further.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.385
I guess they still trust us then.

24:35.427 --> 24:36.738
It means they trust Dorn.

24:37.344 --> 24:38.665
Did you find something?

24:38.682 --> 24:40.855
The victim's don't appear
to have known each other.

24:40.865 --> 24:43.458
Why would you harass a perfect stranger?

24:43.476 --> 24:45.090
It's lucky we have Sebastian.

24:45.319 --> 24:47.290
Never would have got this far without him.

24:51.452 --> 24:52.910
Anything else?

24:53.543 --> 24:54.825
Yeah.

24:56.109 --> 24:59.089
The money that Sebastian came up with?

24:59.209 --> 25:02.224
Don't tell him I told
you, but I gave it to him.

25:02.344 --> 25:04.415
- Did you?
- Aye.

25:04.626 --> 25:06.385
With my family history,

25:06.414 --> 25:09.225
he probably wants it kept a
secret, but that's the story.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.265
Well, we will talk about this back home.

25:12.298 --> 25:15.223
- I can make a statement...
- No, Tommy. At home.

25:16.497 --> 25:18.724
Well, that wasn't strange at all.

25:19.412 --> 25:20.865
They...

25:22.456 --> 25:23.794
are in love.

25:23.914 --> 25:25.711
That poor mother.

25:26.976 --> 25:28.905
Did you...? Did you tell her?

25:28.911 --> 25:31.102
Tell her? No, of course not.

25:31.222 --> 25:32.385
God...

25:32.715 --> 25:35.665
Imagine knowing your daughter
killed herself not to hurt you.

25:35.685 --> 25:37.555
She loved her, I could feel it.

25:37.876 --> 25:39.783
If Amélie had the courage to tell her,

25:39.825 --> 25:41.570
it probably just would have blown over.

25:41.585 --> 25:43.425
Well, I guess sometimes it's hard...

25:43.545 --> 25:45.842
to see past the trouble
right in front of you.

25:46.318 --> 25:47.318
Hi.

25:48.308 --> 25:49.848
How did it go?

25:50.490 --> 25:51.773
Her laptop.

25:51.782 --> 25:53.093
That's good.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.128
With the IPs I got at the cafe,

25:55.145 --> 25:57.392
I should be able to trace
he path back to its origin.

25:57.897 --> 26:00.051
- Can we use your office?
- Sure.

26:02.737 --> 26:05.075
- He's good.
- The best.

26:40.629 --> 26:44.801
- No... Please... no...
- —

26:48.678 --> 26:49.824
I have it.

26:50.026 --> 26:50.970
Where is he?

26:50.979 --> 26:52.501
The messages are coming from Denmark.

26:52.537 --> 26:55.086
Copenhagen. His name is Anttis.

27:08.815 --> 27:11.877
Tommy, watch out here,
especially the windows.

27:11.895 --> 27:13.535
Computer nerds don't run, do they?

27:13.536 --> 27:16.225
- They certainly don't fight.
- Very amusing.

27:27.302 --> 27:28.796
Police!

27:31.941 --> 27:33.866
- Is it the music?
- No.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.231
Yes. It is the music.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.889
Shoot him. If you need a statement, knock.

27:41.173 --> 27:43.437
Thanks for being a good citizen.

27:44.901 --> 27:47.235
Popular with his neighbors.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.195
Police!

28:07.718 --> 28:10.331
Die, you orc scum!

28:10.358 --> 28:13.209
Hey pal! Hey!

28:19.956 --> 28:22.073
- What?
- Police! Stop!

28:22.092 --> 28:24.246
- What the hell?
- Don't move.

28:27.518 --> 28:29.645
They found the computer guy...

28:30.589 --> 28:32.414
Damn, I'm sorry.

28:36.135 --> 28:38.473
I have no idea what you're talking about.

28:38.491 --> 28:40.068
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:40.096 --> 28:43.157
So you haven't been hacking into
web cameras, threatening people?

28:43.277 --> 28:44.496
Never.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.760
The transmissions were
traced here. Text messages?

28:47.880 --> 28:50.345
You said you were looking
for a hacker, right?

28:51.372 --> 28:53.545
They must have hacked me, too.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.964
We can trace everything back
to you. No sense denying.

28:58.936 --> 29:00.861
- Rebecca.
- Two things.

29:01.081 --> 29:04.143
Number one, the judges want
you and Michel to explain

29:04.170 --> 29:05.802
what happened with Sebastian.

29:05.922 --> 29:08.021
- As soon as this case is finished.
- No,

29:08.067 --> 29:10.990
they want you to come today. This evening.

29:11.815 --> 29:13.691
- You said two things.
- Yes.

29:13.811 --> 29:17.518
Suicide hasn't been illegal
in Germany since the 1700s.

29:17.731 --> 29:20.481
You'd have a hard time winning
conviction on anything other

29:20.488 --> 29:23.321
than simple harassment, if that.

29:23.725 --> 29:26.777
Maybe some computer hacking charges.

29:26.897 --> 29:29.651
Though they are not clearly
defined in international law.

29:29.771 --> 29:33.811
In any case, certainly not
murder, or accessory to.

29:33.818 --> 29:36.293
Probably why the subject
does not seem worried.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.979
What do you mean, threatening?

29:38.099 --> 29:39.099
I'm sorry?

29:39.125 --> 29:41.592
You just said "sent threatening texts".

29:41.610 --> 29:43.242
What exactly did they say?

29:43.270 --> 29:45.571
What were these so-called threats?

29:45.616 --> 29:48.568
The threat is to expose
the victim's secrets.

29:48.611 --> 29:50.392
If it's true, how is that a threat?

29:50.512 --> 29:53.084
- What do you mean?
- Well, if you simply tell someone...

29:53.087 --> 29:57.020
you're going to expose a
secret, how is that a threat?

29:59.687 --> 30:03.409
So we are hoping someone at the
internet cafe knows the computer guy?

30:03.647 --> 30:08.038
They just, sent me a text
message. He looks pretty memorable.

30:08.075 --> 30:12.291
- About what you saw in my office.
- You don't have to explain to me.

30:12.301 --> 30:13.658
My son called.

30:13.778 --> 30:16.188
He doesn't understand why
I have to work so much.

30:16.225 --> 30:17.793
He will one day.

30:21.371 --> 30:23.371
This keyboard shouldn't
even be working with

30:23.385 --> 30:25.331
all this sticky stuff all over it.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.153
I had a boss once say a good cop

30:27.171 --> 30:29.280
always washes his hands before he pisses.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.171
Same boss who fired guys
for not getting investigated?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.451
Different boss.

30:38.596 --> 30:41.218
Why does that logo look so familiar?

30:44.674 --> 30:46.608
We have a problem here.

30:46.728 --> 30:49.211
There's a bunch of new texts
to someone named Stefan...

30:49.231 --> 30:51.251
sent through this machine,
but they didn't originate here,

30:51.266 --> 30:53.171
and the IP of the recipient is coded.

30:53.182 --> 30:55.905
Sebastian, for tech
dummies, what does that mean?

30:56.025 --> 30:58.091
There's a new victim I can't identify,

30:58.211 --> 31:00.122
and the real hacker could be anywhere.

31:10.727 --> 31:14.293
Wow, it's almost more busy now than
it was in the middle of the day.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.771
It's an online world.

31:15.797 --> 31:17.740
I don't even have a computer at home.

31:17.786 --> 31:19.771
- Seriously?
- That's surprising?

31:19.784 --> 31:23.305
Well, it's none of my business,
but Eva, she said you and Sebastian,

31:23.314 --> 31:25.051
you were kind of like an item.

31:25.065 --> 31:28.199
And computers were just one of the
things we didn't have in common.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.811
I got it.

31:30.134 --> 31:33.306
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

31:34.943 --> 31:36.345
Well,

31:36.657 --> 31:38.738
you practically confessed.

31:38.858 --> 31:40.452
Yeah, right.

31:41.598 --> 31:43.294
Is that right?

31:43.304 --> 31:44.431
No.

31:44.551 --> 31:48.025
I was just asking how...

31:48.309 --> 31:50.647
saying you're going to do something without

31:50.665 --> 31:53.727
demanding a specific reaction is a threat.

31:53.764 --> 31:56.028
What do you mean, specific reaction?

31:57.531 --> 31:59.988
- An "or else"?
- I'm going to punch you in the mouth.

32:00.006 --> 32:01.006
What?

32:01.445 --> 32:04.865
I didn't say, "or else". Do
you still feel threatened?

32:08.920 --> 32:11.286
- Eva.
- Yeah.

32:11.406 --> 32:13.504
I have to go back to The Hague.

32:13.624 --> 32:15.787
The judges want to talk to me.

32:15.814 --> 32:18.298
- Is it about Sebastian?
- Yes.

32:19.518 --> 32:21.397
Do you know him?

32:22.277 --> 32:25.027
- The texts use your system as a proxy.
- Yeah.

32:25.046 --> 32:26.397
They come from outside your network,

32:26.421 --> 32:27.704
but there's no way you didn't see them.

32:27.723 --> 32:29.510
No way you didn't know
they were being sent.

32:29.537 --> 32:33.489
These are new texts. Who is
Stefan? Is that your next victim?

32:33.745 --> 32:35.238
His replies are getting more desperate.

32:35.239 --> 32:37.091
Are you going to let him die, too?

32:37.211 --> 32:39.483
- Can I ask you a question?
- Put your hand down.

32:40.749 --> 32:44.452
How the hell is any of this illegal?

32:44.498 --> 32:46.157
Guys...

32:48.733 --> 32:50.347
He's right.

32:51.089 --> 32:53.592
Rebecca just called. We have
nothing to arrest him on.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.802
I don't care, you should see these texts.

32:55.922 --> 32:58.955
The new victim is getting
very desperate, Louis.

32:59.652 --> 33:01.595
Can you track where he is?

33:01.715 --> 33:04.666
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

33:05.693 --> 33:06.693
—

33:15.712 --> 33:17.060
Sebastian, what are you doing?

33:17.078 --> 33:18.948
I cloned Antti's drive.

33:19.232 --> 33:22.116
I can see anything that goes
through it in almost real time.

33:22.597 --> 33:24.988
There are more messages
going out to Stefan right now.

33:24.989 --> 33:26.520
How can it not be illegal?

33:26.640 --> 33:31.406
If suicide is not illegal, causing
someone to do it is not either.

33:31.443 --> 33:34.285
So it's okay to convince someone
to face-plant into a car park,

33:34.405 --> 33:36.659
but the ICC wants you to go after Sebastian

33:36.687 --> 33:38.484
cause he lost a bunch of his own money?

33:38.511 --> 33:41.716
- Or someone else's.
- Right, someone else's.

33:42.581 --> 33:44.676
- No...
- What?

33:45.111 --> 33:48.723
He just got a new message with
instructions on how to make a noose.

33:59.714 --> 34:01.721
- Carl.
- Yeah.

34:01.758 --> 34:03.931
- I have to go back to The Hague.
- I heard.

34:04.051 --> 34:06.415
- You need anything?
- I think it will be all right.

34:06.452 --> 34:08.157
- Well, let me know.
- Yes.

34:08.277 --> 34:11.237
What kind of person sends a strange
instructions on making a noose?

34:11.246 --> 34:12.676
Son of a bitch!

34:12.795 --> 34:15.196
- What?
- That's the same.

34:15.396 --> 34:18.672
It's the same as the sticker, the
button that we saw in his apartment.

34:18.793 --> 34:21.514
Antti and Amélie must have
gone to the same summer camp.

34:21.635 --> 34:24.996
Erlebnis Camp, Wiesenfelden...

34:25.116 --> 34:26.933
No one recognizes him.

34:27.244 --> 34:29.396
Half of them didn't really look.

34:29.516 --> 34:31.975
Too engrossed in their
virtual world to be bothered

34:31.993 --> 34:34.036
by people dying in the real one.

34:34.331 --> 34:37.716
Cross-referencing Amélie
Weurfel and Erlebnis Camp.

34:37.835 --> 34:40.676
Here, she's listed as an
alumni, four years ago.

34:40.684 --> 34:43.701
- She would have been 14.
- Type in Gross. Martin Gross.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.116
He's another one of the victims.

34:45.487 --> 34:48.396
Yup, he's here, too. Same time.

34:48.411 --> 34:50.596
Here's a list of the campers from then.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.638
Do we have a Stefan?

34:53.005 --> 34:55.835
Stefan Hoster. His
address is here in Berlin.

34:55.837 --> 34:57.239
Any chance he still lives there?

34:57.240 --> 35:00.676
A 19-year-old still living with
his parents? Pretty damned good.

35:00.687 --> 35:02.076
What's that?

35:02.584 --> 35:04.476
Something's being sent to Stefan.

35:04.802 --> 35:06.516
Oh, no.

35:13.842 --> 35:15.666
- Sebastian?
- Yeah, we're back.

35:15.703 --> 35:19.022
- Listen, are you still at the cafe?
- We're just leaving.

35:19.067 --> 35:21.331
- He's sending a video right now!
- What?

35:21.332 --> 35:24.256
Someone at the cafe is uploading
a video through the Wi-Fi.

35:24.302 --> 35:26.505
It will take some time at the
speed they have to work with.

35:26.529 --> 35:28.565
Look at any of the screens that are open.

35:28.685 --> 35:30.866
- They'll have a status bar filling up.
- Okay...

35:30.884 --> 35:32.975
We have a possible line
on the new victim, too.

35:33.020 --> 35:34.543
I'm on my way to you with Tommy,

35:34.561 --> 35:36.174
the rest of the team
are going to his house.

35:36.193 --> 35:37.193
Okay.

35:38.228 --> 35:41.156
I hope you know what a
status bar looks like.

35:49.015 --> 35:50.812
- This is it.
- Who?

35:53.838 --> 35:56.345
- Can you stop the upload?
- I can try.

35:56.799 --> 35:57.723
Keep an eye on him.

35:57.724 --> 35:59.374
- He's not going to be happy...
- What are you doing?

35:59.393 --> 36:01.703
- That's my computer.
- It is?

36:02.134 --> 36:04.425
Kommissar Eichholtz, LKA.

36:05.562 --> 36:08.312
- You're the police?
- What is your name?

36:09.247 --> 36:11.640
Anka. Jostun.

36:15.389 --> 36:18.497
No, leave me alone. Stop it.

36:33.778 --> 36:35.465
Please...

36:40.855 --> 36:43.825
Anka, we know what you've been doing.

36:46.191 --> 36:47.621
Do you?

36:48.061 --> 36:49.785
It needs to stop.

36:50.151 --> 36:51.380
Not yet.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.580
You need to tell me how
to delete this upload.

36:53.617 --> 36:55.249
And why would I do that?

36:55.294 --> 36:57.625
Because Stefan might hurt himself.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.385
Well, I hope he does.

37:00.429 --> 37:02.305
You hope he does?

37:02.425 --> 37:05.242
Anka, you've caused a lot
of people to hurt themselves.

37:05.269 --> 37:07.865
Not a lot. Four.

37:07.891 --> 37:09.597
Do you know who they are?

37:09.862 --> 37:11.384
What they did?

37:11.504 --> 37:14.446
- It doesn't matter what they did...
- Well, it matters to me!

37:16.986 --> 37:21.478
My parents, they made him go all
the way to Germany for summer camp.

37:22.881 --> 37:25.200
He was alone in a strange country,

37:25.320 --> 37:27.985
and all he wanted was to be their friend.

37:28.253 --> 37:30.526
They were the popular kids there,

37:31.324 --> 37:34.844
and they let him think that they liked him,

37:35.083 --> 37:37.265
they let him hang out with them.

37:38.841 --> 37:41.692
He was a fat, pimply-faced boy

37:41.930 --> 37:44.002
who never had any friends,

37:44.122 --> 37:47.985
and they made him feel like
he was special that summer.

37:48.541 --> 37:52.585
Amélie even pretended to
be into him romantically,

37:52.705 --> 37:55.325
and he actually believed her.

37:55.682 --> 37:58.265
He sent letters home that summer,

37:58.385 --> 38:01.183
about how he had fallen in love.

38:02.457 --> 38:03.985
In love!

38:05.216 --> 38:07.825
She played him perfectly.

38:08.701 --> 38:12.705
She even let him hold her hand,
and they took pictures of that,

38:13.624 --> 38:15.448
a pathetic nobody

38:15.568 --> 38:19.381
holding the hand of the
prettiest girl he had ever seen,

38:19.683 --> 38:22.040
and that's where Stefan came in,

38:22.160 --> 38:24.011
the worst of them all.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.724
Peter couldn't see her face
when the picture was taken,

38:26.742 --> 38:30.745
but he did later, when Stefan
posted it all over the internet,

38:31.207 --> 38:34.745
his naked body displayed for the joke.

38:35.268 --> 38:38.105
Pictures of him cleaning up after them...

38:38.358 --> 38:42.065
just looking at Amélie when
she was doing something.

38:42.185 --> 38:45.564
It was love in his eyes,

38:45.684 --> 38:47.736
but Stefan, he made it look...

38:48.873 --> 38:50.465
dirty,

38:51.788 --> 38:53.411
sick.

38:53.704 --> 38:55.482
The shy kid

38:55.977 --> 38:59.396
who had made it through life
by pretending not to be there,

38:59.516 --> 39:03.225
he was suddenly everywhere.

39:03.677 --> 39:05.337
Humiliated.

39:06.638 --> 39:07.839
Laughed at.

39:09.504 --> 39:10.504
Mocked.

39:11.264 --> 39:13.532
But he ended it in our bathtub,

39:15.503 --> 39:17.184
his wrists cut open.

39:20.424 --> 39:22.599
I found him, but it was too late.

39:26.424 --> 39:27.963
His name was

39:28.348 --> 39:30.328
Peter Jostun,

39:31.504 --> 39:33.481
and he was my little brother,

39:34.343 --> 39:36.524
and he matters to me.

39:46.700 --> 39:49.065
So I did the same thing they did.

39:49.504 --> 39:51.513
I found their secrets,

39:51.633 --> 39:53.344
their hidden moments,

39:53.464 --> 39:56.106
and I told them I'd make them public.

39:56.984 --> 40:00.424
Only I gave them a chance
they never gave him.

40:00.644 --> 40:04.420
So they could kill themselves
before being humiliated.

40:06.224 --> 40:07.354
Yes.

40:07.931 --> 40:10.727
The easy way out.

40:15.275 --> 40:17.237
I can do it myself...

40:22.864 --> 40:24.515
I just spoke to Eva.

40:24.824 --> 40:27.864
They were able to resuscitate
Stefan. He's going to be all right.

40:27.984 --> 40:29.804
But I can't hold her very long.

40:30.024 --> 40:32.683
No, and she has all his secrets.

40:32.701 --> 40:35.378
There's nothing to stop her from
doing it again when she gets out.

40:35.498 --> 40:36.845
Except me,

40:36.965 --> 40:39.201
in all my spare time.

40:39.476 --> 40:41.722
Kind of sucks being the boss.

40:57.543 --> 40:59.982
Okay, we're ready to go.

41:00.384 --> 41:01.825
Thanks for your help.

41:03.064 --> 41:04.841
Good luck with the home invasions.

41:05.224 --> 41:06.839
I'll need it.

41:17.104 --> 41:18.399
It's about Eric.

41:19.584 --> 41:20.874
What about Eric?

41:21.304 --> 41:22.304
Well...

41:24.348 --> 41:25.990
he's about the right age. I mean,

41:26.604 --> 41:29.702
we would have still been going
out when he was conceived.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.470
Are you asking if you're his father?

41:33.451 --> 41:35.991
It's not such a crazy notion.

41:36.624 --> 41:38.558
Of course you are.

41:42.784 --> 41:44.765
What kind of slut do you think I am?

41:44.784 --> 41:47.754
No, no, no, no, no, but I mean...

41:47.874 --> 41:49.523
why didn't you tell me?

41:50.264 --> 41:51.650
Why would I?

41:52.384 --> 41:53.658
Do you think I

41:53.778 --> 41:55.849
wouldn't want to be part of his life?

41:56.184 --> 41:59.024
I wouldn't want you to, Sebastian.

41:59.144 --> 42:01.503
You lost everything
when we were together...

42:01.504 --> 42:03.824
our house, our car,

42:03.944 --> 42:05.988
you gambled it all away.

42:06.344 --> 42:09.344
It took me almost four
years to get out of debt.

42:09.464 --> 42:11.167
I don't want that for Eric,

42:11.213 --> 42:13.459
and I don't want it for me.

42:16.464 --> 42:19.720
- But I've changed.
- Yeah, so I've heard.

42:20.746 --> 42:22.689
- —
- No.

42:22.809 --> 42:25.624
I'd like a chance to show you
that I really have changed.

42:25.981 --> 42:28.511
I know it will take some time, but I'm

42:28.529 --> 42:30.418
willing to take the time.

42:30.664 --> 42:32.151
But until then...

42:33.184 --> 42:36.542
could I at least call once in a while?

42:37.824 --> 42:39.605
Talk to him, and

42:40.017 --> 42:41.915
teach him some things?

42:45.904 --> 42:47.451
That could be...

42:53.118 --> 42:55.290
I think that might be nice.

43:00.624 --> 43:02.081
Okay.

43:13.464 --> 43:14.914
Hey.

43:15.704 --> 43:19.104
Just talked to the hospital.
Stefan's parents are with him.

43:19.224 --> 43:20.224
Good.

43:21.881 --> 43:23.784
So, Sebastian...

43:23.904 --> 43:26.803
Don't tell me. You gave him the money.

43:28.424 --> 43:31.184
Who the hell would
believe I had 30,000 Euro?

43:31.304 --> 43:32.478
Anyway,

43:32.881 --> 43:35.036
you already know who gave him the money.

43:35.584 --> 43:38.584
- Did Sebastian tell you?
- He would never give you away.

43:38.704 --> 43:41.287
- Then how?
- It's something you would do.

43:42.679 --> 43:45.255
Both Eva and Tommy confessed to it.

43:45.704 --> 43:48.464
Good. Good, that's what partners do.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.884
- Family.
- That too.

43:51.864 --> 43:53.478
Here comes my meeting.

43:57.325 --> 43:59.142
Do you want me to tell him that I did it?

43:59.153 --> 44:01.288
Who would believe you had 30,000 Euro?

44:01.302 --> 44:02.582
Yeah, all right, right.

44:02.702 --> 44:04.772
I thought you were in Serbia. Welcome home.

44:05.302 --> 44:06.723
Thank you, Hickman.

44:07.008 --> 44:08.777
It's cold out there.

44:12.041 --> 44:13.342
Louis...

44:14.644 --> 44:17.358
I restricted Sebastian Berger

44:17.578 --> 44:22.060
to these offices until the investigation
was concluded, and you released him.

44:22.500 --> 44:23.500
Why?

44:23.822 --> 44:27.588
- I know all I need to know.
- You know, or you knew?

44:27.862 --> 44:28.532
I knew.

44:28.550 --> 44:31.142
You knew about the gambling,
and you did not tell me?

44:31.262 --> 44:32.422
I paid his debt.

44:32.542 --> 44:35.426
Sebastian Berger is not corrupt in any way,

44:35.622 --> 44:39.130
he's just very bad at
picking football winners.

44:39.702 --> 44:40.822
It cost a lot in his life.

44:41.422 --> 44:43.702
It should have cost his place on this team.

44:43.822 --> 44:46.326
He never used ICC equipment to bet,

44:46.342 --> 44:49.622
and he has not gambled
since coming to me about it.

44:49.822 --> 44:50.946
He came to you?

44:50.982 --> 44:54.022
He was afraid owing so
much could compromise him.

44:54.222 --> 44:56.542
He offered to quit. I refused.

44:56.662 --> 44:58.793
Are you certain you have all the facts,

44:58.913 --> 45:00.618
that it's over?

45:02.066 --> 45:03.707
He made a bad mistake.

45:04.752 --> 45:06.262
I've made many myself.

45:06.902 --> 45:10.302
Luckily, someone always helped me.

45:11.326 --> 45:14.462
Whoever sent me those files
and sent them to the newspapers,

45:14.582 --> 45:17.862
they were intent on making us look corrupt,

45:17.982 --> 45:19.742
to embarrass the ICC.

45:19.982 --> 45:21.740
I'll issue a statement tomorrow...

45:22.022 --> 45:25.702
saying that we have conducted
an internal investigated...

45:25.822 --> 45:27.421
and found nothing of note,

45:27.422 --> 45:31.022
and then if that "anonymous
Italian" wants to press,

45:31.142 --> 45:34.868
he will find a formidable
enemy waiting for him.

45:35.502 --> 45:36.784
Thank you, Dorn.

45:39.231 --> 45:40.702
Where did you get the money?

45:41.062 --> 45:42.062
Oh...

45:42.403 --> 45:43.862
our savings.

45:43.982 --> 45:46.447
- Does Rebecca know?
- Not yet,

45:46.850 --> 45:49.087
tonight. Would you like to come with me?

45:50.792 --> 45:54.368
Not on a bet, Louis. Not on a bet!
