01:31.240 --> 01:34.600
Mr Saunders on antibiotics,
MPO for three days.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.760
The diverticulitis should be
responding to the treatment.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.560
All right, I think you ought
to look for an abscess.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.400
Why don't you order an ultrasound?

01:42.400 --> 01:42.840
Yes, sir.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.320
Yes, sir.
Now, I want to remind you that
the blood drive starts next week,

01:46.320 --> 01:48.800
so please help us out
by sticking it in.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.560
Very funny, sir!

01:49.560 --> 01:52.480
Very funny, sir!
I'm counting on all of
you to get out there

01:52.480 --> 01:54.000
    and give us good corpuscle.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.040
Old joke, where's
       he get his material?

01:56.040 --> 01:59.560
I think that's all... No,
the community service assignment.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.920
It seems that the state correctional
administrators would like

02:02.920 --> 02:06.400
a resident of ours to do clinic
work at the Newcastle penitentiary,

02:06.400 --> 02:09.440
 so Dr Morrison, you start today.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.840
Check with me later about details.

02:10.840 --> 02:11.960
Check with me later about details.
Thank you, sir.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.720
        All right, thanks.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.560
Who loosened Westphall's tie?

02:15.560 --> 02:18.480
If his step had any more
bounce to it he could slam dunk.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.000
White male, late 30s,
      OD-ed on Quaaludes.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.880
All right, in here.
I need a nurse.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.760
BP is 85 over 40,
pulse 46, respiration shallow.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.760
All right, get him on a monitor, drop
an NG tube and lavage until clear.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.280
And don't forget the wrinkles...

02:37.280 --> 02:40.160
circles under the eyes,
     saggy panty hose.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.400
I draw 'em as I see 'em and you're
just about prettiest physician

02:43.400 --> 02:44.360
that's ever given me the once over.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.720
that's ever given me the once over.
Oh, well, thank you.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.720
What I generally get is doctors
who are old guys with nose hair.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.800
Well give me time,
I'm still in med school.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.320
Oh, you're a student driver, eh?

02:56.320 --> 02:58.080
You going to give me a discount?

02:58.080 --> 02:59.320
Hospitals don't work
like barber colleges.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.040
Hospitals don't work
like barber colleges.
Oh, come on.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.400
Everybody takes a bit off the top.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.400
Oh, damn, this arthritis is beginning
to cut into my drawing time.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.880
I can give you something
for the pain, Mr Piker.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.920
You know, I've been enjoying
        your comic strip ever since,

03:13.920 --> 03:16.120
well, before I could read.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.480
I used to just look at the
pictures in Little Rico and laugh.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.440
I still read it every Sunday.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.560
  Who's your favourite character?

03:22.560 --> 03:25.080
  Who's your favourite character?
Oh, gee, I love them all so much.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.600
Erm...Nugget, Mayf,
                 especially Wombat,

03:28.600 --> 03:32.600
she's always getting herself
        into such deep trouble.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.920
Er, 200 over 120, Mr Piker,
         that's extremely high.

03:37.560 --> 03:41.000
I'll have to talk to a senior res,
he may want to admit you for tests.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.480
OK. Sign me up.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.400
I have to go and get some paperwork.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.760
Hey, Novino, what do
you think's wrong?

03:48.760 --> 03:52.760
I don't know.
   We'll have to see the next panel.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.200
Vitamin Q for breakfast, huh?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.600
Took the header right
into his bowl of cereal.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.600
Order a chest X-ray, make sure
      he didn't swallow the prize.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.200
Jail, Boomer. Do not pass go,
do not collect Â¤200.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.080
Hold on, let me tie my shoe.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.360
Hold on, let me tie my shoe.
Tough luck, kiddo.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.360
Prison reform happens to be
something that I care about.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.840
Do you know what
conditions are like in there?

04:14.840 --> 04:16.760
Oh yeah, sure,
            you ever been in prison?

04:16.760 --> 04:17.959
Oh yeah, sure,
            you ever been in prison?
           No. Have you?

04:17.959 --> 04:21.040
Yeah. Take it from me, believe me,
stay home, call in sick.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.160
       What were you in for?

04:22.160 --> 04:25.600
My Aunt Cherise took me on a trip
to Alcatraz on my birthday one year.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.360
In Massachusetts alone there
are something like...I don't know...

04:29.360 --> 04:30.880
250 inmates to every doctor.

04:30.880 --> 04:34.120
Can you imagine what kind of
treatment those people are getting?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.560
For someone who spends half
   his life in a trance,

04:36.560 --> 04:37.920
why this sudden burst
    of social responsibility?

04:37.920 --> 04:40.080
why this sudden burst
    of social responsibility?
Yeah? &gt;

04:40.080 --> 04:44.080
I got a lot to be grateful for.
I passed my remedial, my knee's OK,

04:44.360 --> 04:48.000
my son's safe and sound.
It's time to give something back.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.720
Yeah, and since you're
              giving something back,

04:50.720 --> 04:53.240
how about my orange sweater,
        you know?

04:53.240 --> 04:57.240
Well, thank you.
Genuine Jersey Piker.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.080
It must be quite a joy, what you do,
making people laugh, smile.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.680
Oh, it's a joy all right.
But I tell you something,

05:03.680 --> 05:06.960
I couldn't have put out a daily
comic strip for the last 52 years

05:06.960 --> 05:09.320
   unless the work made me happy too.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.920
I work at home, in a small house
that my father built in Marblehead.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.280
I spend the morning sitting in
front of the bay window drawing.

05:16.280 --> 05:20.280
You know, you can look out across
the salt marshes to the ocean.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.360
Rico, Nugget, me,
we all just sit there

05:24.360 --> 05:28.360
and we like to see the fog bank roll
in and out. What more could I ask?

05:29.480 --> 05:31.720
I live with my friends
in my imagination.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.840
That's the best of
all possible worlds.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.240
Your imagination
must be quite a place.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.240
It sure beats the
stuffing out of Boston.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.280
This is a cow.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.280
She goes moo.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.560
This is a rooster.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.560
He goes, cock-a-doodle-doo.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.680
And here's Old MacDonald himself.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.040
He complains a lot about the farm,

06:01.040 --> 06:04.160
so the government
gives him price supports.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.520
So there you have it.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.520
# Old MacDonald has a farm,
Ee i ee i o. #

06:10.120 --> 06:11.320
Ellen? &gt;

06:11.320 --> 06:14.760
For crying out loud, didn't I ask
  you to pick-up some Huggies today?

06:14.760 --> 06:15.800
We're almost out.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.040
I just didn't get to
the store today, Mark.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.960
I haven't been feeling well lately.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.840
Well, maybe you're coming down with
something. Don't give it to Barbara.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.880
I just can't seem to shake this pain.
Should I see a doctor?

06:26.880 --> 06:28.120
What kind of pain?

06:28.120 --> 06:30.480
What kind of pain?
         Female problems.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.600
 Been bothering me for a week now.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.560
Why didn't you speak up sooner?

06:34.560 --> 06:38.000
I haven't seen you to talk to
in days. You're never home.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.400
When you are here, all you
do is play with the baby.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.920
Last week you were complaining

06:41.920 --> 06:44.280
that I didn't spend
enough time with Barbara.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.880
Now I'm pitching in,
isn't that right, precious?

06:46.880 --> 06:49.800
Call what's his name,
your gynaecologist.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.400
What's his name is
skiing in Switzerland.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.280
Then see one of the doctors
at the hospital.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.200
Could you make an appointment for me?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.560
This little piggy went to market.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.040
Which is more than your
grandmother did today.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.400
Mark?

07:03.400 --> 07:07.400
Oh, look at the time! Holy Moses,
we've got to get Barbara to bed.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.920
            (SHE SIGHS)

07:12.400 --> 07:16.000
This is an odd way to say hello.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.360
Rule number one,

07:18.360 --> 07:21.040
always make sure
there's a bull present.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.440
That's what we call the guards.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.680
Never see an inmate alone.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.680
Never see more than one at a time.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.040
Do you want to empty
your pockets over there?

07:30.040 --> 07:33.720
They'll try to test you. They'll try
to manipulate you, look for an edge.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.320
Don't you have to treat them as a
patient first and a prisoner second?

07:37.320 --> 07:40.520
You see anything suspicious,
report it to a bull.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.920
Want to take off your belt?

07:42.920 --> 07:45.280
I can't violate the
confidence of a patient

07:45.280 --> 07:46.920
just because he's behind bars.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.920
This is penitentiary,
not a prep-school.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.760
     It's good to have you, Morrison.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.880
We're understaffed, overworked,
what else is new? Right?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.840
       Ever treated criminals before?

08:10.840 --> 08:12.760
Yeah, in the jail ward
at St Elegius.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.200
That's street stuff,
this is the big leagues.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.960
            Rapists to axe murderers.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.920
          Enough work for 12 doctors.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.320
The place was built
to house 600 inmates,

08:21.320 --> 08:24.800
presently we're
at 1, 150 and counting.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.280
   Inmates call Newcastle "The Mine".

08:27.280 --> 08:31.280
Hard, cold
and everybody gets to shaft.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.400
Worked here 20 years. The sound
still goes right through me.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.480
Nice perfume.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.640
I don't wear perfume.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.960
  Vanilla extract, in my cookie.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.320
When I woke up this morning,
        you were on my mind.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.400
The wee five?

08:50.400 --> 08:54.400
Are you busy tonight?
We could go to Anthony's and watch
  the fishing boats chug in.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.960
I have to present Mr Surran
on ground rounds tomorrow.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.080
Interstitial on Friday so I have
to bone up on my recent literature.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.600
Interstitial on Friday so I have
to bone up on my recent literature.
In other words, pass.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.600
Thanks for the offer. I just don't
feel like going out tonight.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.200
You sure that's not perfume?

09:10.200 --> 09:11.680
Hi, Helen.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.080
Tondy, I've heard
your war stories before.

09:14.080 --> 09:18.080
You'll get Little Rico tomorrow.
That's as fast as I can work.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.080
Editors, deadlines! Who needs 'em?

09:21.080 --> 09:21.800
            Hi, Jersey.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.400
            Hi, Jersey.
Hi.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.840
            Hi, Jersey.
Hi.
Mr Piker, I'm Dr Westphall,
I'm a kidney specialist.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.040
Do you mind if I take
a look at your ankles?

09:28.040 --> 09:29.000
You're the first man ever to ask!

09:29.000 --> 09:30.080
You're the first man ever to ask!
Am I?!

09:30.080 --> 09:33.600
Why not, go crazy!

09:33.600 --> 09:35.640
What does this have
to do with arthritis?

09:35.640 --> 09:39.240
The blood tests along with your high
blood pressure and swollen ankles

09:39.240 --> 09:41.800
indicate that kidney function
might be damaged.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.960
Have you been taking
Ibuprofen for your arthritis?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.440
The pain used to be just
in my wrists and ankles,

09:47.440 --> 09:49.280
now it's the forearm, hands, shins.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.320
Give me your hand, Carol.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.720
Feel the crepitus, huh?

09:52.720 --> 09:53.880
              Uh-huh.

09:53.880 --> 09:54.880
The joint's deteriorating.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.000
The joint's deteriorating.
                               Mm-hm.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.720
Oh, that feels good.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.600
Now, you two make a nice couple.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.960
Where have you been
getting the Ibuprofen?

10:01.960 --> 10:05.240
I borrowed some from my neighbour
   'til his prescription ran out.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.480
Then I bought some of
         the over-the-counter stuff,

10:08.480 --> 10:11.800
didn't pack as big a wallop,
so I tripled the dose.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.480
And you've never been
under a doctor's supervision?

10:14.480 --> 10:17.200
First time I've been
down to Boston since fall.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.760
Maybe you should go in
private practice together.

10:19.760 --> 10:23.080
Mr Piker, the next time you decide
to do your own doctoring,

10:23.080 --> 10:24.880
I suggest you read the directions.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.280
You've exceeded the recommended
dosage, you could be on your way

10:28.280 --> 10:31.240
to kidney dialysis. Stop taking
the Ibuprofen and probably

10:31.240 --> 10:34.640
your high blood pressure
and the other symptoms will go away.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.120
With my hands like this
    I can hardly sign my name

10:37.120 --> 10:40.120
let alone draw
Little Rico's snubby little nose.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.160
Right, Carol, order some X-rays
of the affected bones

10:43.160 --> 10:44.720
and get a rheumatoid factor.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.640
Now, Mr Piker, we're going to
give you another medication

10:47.640 --> 10:50.800
as soon as we know what kind of
arthritis you have. All right?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.200
We'll see you later. Bye.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.280
We'll see you later. Bye.
               Bye.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.280
This is what I meant
by my world inside the comic strip.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.240
Nobody grows old,
nobody has arthritis, nobody dies.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.840
I feel like the fairy
godmother of Mrs Impery's child.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.800
The kid is cute with a capital Q.
I come by here every couple

11:13.800 --> 11:16.520
of hours to congratulate myself
on a job well done.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.080
             That's terrific, Victor.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.800
This whole tour of duty in
the dark realms of mystery

11:20.800 --> 11:22.480
has been a blessing in disguise.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.440
Not only does Dr Craig think
I'm the cat's pyjamas again,

11:25.440 --> 11:28.560
I've begun to realise what
incredible creatures women are.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.560
Strong, resilient. If it were
  up to men to bear children,

11:31.560 --> 11:34.160
the species would have thrown in
 the Palaeolithic towel.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.760
If you're so high on OB GYN,
why do you wanna leave?

11:36.760 --> 11:38.800
You kidding?
Back to cardiac surgery.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.960
Ventricles, tubes,
a man can relate to.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.720
 The adieus will have to wait, kiddo.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.240
I'm working labour delivery,
you're in the clinic.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.160
Where's Jacobson?

11:46.160 --> 11:49.200
Where's Jacobson?
                He blew with the flu.

11:49.200 --> 11:53.160
Besides, this is probably the last
pelvic you'll ever have to do.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.440
I mean, how bad can it be?

11:54.440 --> 11:54.960
Right-o.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.000
Right-o.
All right.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.440
Top of the morning Mrs...

12:01.440 --> 12:05.440
Craig?!

12:12.920 --> 12:16.480
Jackie, you gotta help me out. It's
a matter of life and death, mine.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.280
                 I'm late for rounds.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.720
                 I'm late for rounds.
Mrs Craig is in there
cooling her heels.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.560
                            So?

12:20.560 --> 12:23.160
                            So?
Would you mind performing
a pelvic exam for me?

12:23.160 --> 12:24.240
                   Yes. I would mind.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.240
How can I look Dr Craig in the eye
after looking at his wife
in the cervical epithelia?

12:28.280 --> 12:32.280
Victor, she's a woman in distress.
Even if she is Dr Craig's wife...

12:32.520 --> 12:35.680
I have a sacred responsibility
to see that she receives

12:35.680 --> 12:37.720
proper medical care. I know,
  that's what I keep telling myself.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.040
proper medical care. I know,
  that's what I keep telling myself.
So what are you afraid of?

12:40.040 --> 12:44.040
Peroxide.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.040
Do you keep all your
patients waiting this long?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.360
Sorry.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.840
I ran down the cafeteria
     for a quick sandwich.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.720
They say turkey has
    a natural sedative effect.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.040
     Victor, are you nervous?

13:03.040 --> 13:05.840
It's just that erm...

13:05.840 --> 13:07.920
Well...terrified,

13:07.920 --> 13:11.560
non specific dread, existential
 angst. Nothing important.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.000
What did you say your problem was?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.600
I have this sharp pain
in the pelvic area.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.600
You know what I'm thinking,
I'm thinking if I give you

13:19.600 --> 13:22.120
a little bit more time alone
it will just go away.

13:22.120 --> 13:26.120
I don't think so, Victor. It's
been bothering me for a week now.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.960
Did you ever consider
visualisation therapy?

13:30.960 --> 13:33.000
Very big in Berkeley in the '60s.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.440
You visualise the pain in your
mind's eye and you make it smaller.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.240
         Let's go, Victor.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.000
 I left Barbara with a babysitter.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.080
This pain, is it
constant or sporadic?

13:45.080 --> 13:47.440
Well, it comes in waves,
mostly at night.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.040
And this pain is located where?

13:50.040 --> 13:51.640
        In the pelvic area.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.640
Right. Wait a second.
Did I just hear myself being paged?

13:56.080 --> 14:00.080
Victor, am I going to have
to perform this exam myself?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.400
Er, Mrs Craig, could you...

14:03.400 --> 14:05.440
   Look, you're a professional.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.760
You just treat me like you
would any other patient.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.080
You just treat me like you
would any other patient.
Are you sure?

14:09.080 --> 14:10.280
               Yes.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.400
OK.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.200
Look, at Newcastle this is as
close as you get to paradise.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.160
Every inmate in the joint
is going to be hitting on you

14:19.160 --> 14:23.160
for time in here, so be prepared.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.120
Sunny, I'd like you
to meet Dr Jack Morrison.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.880
Reinforcements, a pleasure.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.840
You'll be working together in the
clinic, she'll show you the ropes.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.600
She's heard every kind of con
  from every kind of con.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.040
Here are the autopsy results.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.120
Heroin OD?

14:40.120 --> 14:42.760
And good quality from
the looks of the lab report.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.160
       How do they get drugs in here?

14:45.160 --> 14:47.760
Are you really that green?

14:47.760 --> 14:50.600
Copy this for the supervisor
will you, please?

14:50.600 --> 14:52.600
Right.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.040
Be careful in here.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.080
      Look, I know what criminals do.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.720
My brother's a cop.
I've seen the victims in the ER.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.720
And I still intend to give
these people the best care I can.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.840
I was just like you
when I came here.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.560
Work within the system.
Change things, huh?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.400
Nothing ever changes.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.440
        You're burned out.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.240
No, son, I'm way past burned out.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.880
The worst part of it is I don't
even feel like a doctor any more.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.880
I'm a veterinarian.

15:27.320 --> 15:31.320
No masses, no scarring,
ovaries appear normal.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.680
      How about an ectopic pregnancy?

15:33.680 --> 15:36.720
Blood HCG is negative.
Tubes are clear.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.960
     Pain or tenderness on palpation?

15:38.960 --> 15:42.000
Clean bill of health. Damn.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.560
So you'd rather Mrs Craig
had something wrong?

15:44.560 --> 15:48.560
Nothing serious. Treatable, non life
threatening, preferably esoteric.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.440
Impress Dr Craig with
my diagnostic skills.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.760
Wait a minute, you mean
to tell me you would actually

15:54.760 --> 15:57.880
wish a disease on someone
just to further your own ends?

15:57.880 --> 16:01.320
I'm amazed at what a morally
bankrupt human being you really are.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.440
I amaze myself sometimes.
But put yourself in my boat shoes.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.560
I go to Craig empty handed,
he thinks I've done a slapdash job

16:07.560 --> 16:09.920
and Victor Erlich
is out of surgery forever.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.920
Victor, let's pretend that
we never had this conversation, OK?

16:14.160 --> 16:16.760
Phil, come on. I know you
think I'm a scuz bucket

16:16.760 --> 16:18.560
but please, could you
do me one tiny favour?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.320
but please, could you
do me one tiny favour?
                          What?

16:20.320 --> 16:24.320
Could you drop these test
results off at Dr Craig's office?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.880
Come on, it's on your way!

16:26.880 --> 16:29.560
Hey, Doc, would you open
up the door for me, please?

16:29.560 --> 16:30.440
What, this door?

16:30.440 --> 16:31.160
What, this door?
Uh-huh.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.840
What, this door?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.360
Thanks, Doc.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.240
Oh, Dr Westphall,
I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.120
Oh, Dr Westphall,
I'm on the horns of a dilemma.
SMASHING GLASS

16:38.120 --> 16:41.560
Excuse me, Ehrlich,
I'm late for a consult.

16:41.560 --> 16:45.160
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.800
I did a routine
            chest X-ray of Mr Piker.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.800
There's a tumour in his left lung.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.400
Well, that explains
the arthritis then.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.360
It frequently accompanies
respiratory lesions.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.079
Did you do a bronchoscopy?

17:05.079 --> 17:08.079
The results came back positive.

17:08.079 --> 17:09.680
Oat cell carcinoma,

17:09.680 --> 17:13.480
brain scan shows evidence
    of metastatic disease.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.800
Have you spoken to Mr Piker?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.200
Have you spoken to Mr Piker?
No, not yet.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.240
I just can't walk into his room
and tell him he's gonna die.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.839
Carol, remember when you do,
give the man hope.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.680
I've worked in this ward longer

17:24.680 --> 17:28.200
than most of the doctors in this
hospital. I've heard the pep talks!

17:28.200 --> 17:30.360
I've watched
     the patients die anyway!

17:30.360 --> 17:34.240
Well, you go into his room with
that attitude and he will die.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.680
Look, Carol, I don't care if the
man's chances are 50-50 or 100 to 1,

17:37.680 --> 17:40.800
the patients count on us for
more than just medical treatment.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.280
They need encouragement,
inspiration too.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.160
Sometimes we need another person

17:45.160 --> 17:49.160
to help us see
the possibilities in life.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.880
Are we talking about Mr Piker

17:51.880 --> 17:55.880
or about watching the
fishing boats chug in?

18:02.120 --> 18:04.240
Can we get him into detox?

18:04.240 --> 18:06.320
                   Takes three weeks.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.320
Watch your teeth.
Why don't you sit down here?

18:10.680 --> 18:13.520
You've probably landed yourself
 a case of serum hep

18:13.520 --> 18:15.120
using dirty needles.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.200
I'll give you some Colonadine
to take the edge off the shakes.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.200
How about some delight?

18:19.200 --> 18:20.320
How about some delight?
Oh, no no no.

18:20.320 --> 18:24.320
You'd probably just
sell the stuff anyway.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.720
Not so fast.

18:29.720 --> 18:33.200
Open your hand.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.240
You're on report.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.240
Drop dead.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.160
You gotta watch it, Doctor.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.600
Right.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.320
Aren't you afraid for your
safety, working in here?

18:48.320 --> 18:50.600
Because I'm a woman?

18:50.600 --> 18:53.080
I take care of these
guys when they're sick,

18:53.080 --> 18:55.000
I listen to their problems.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.360
I'm the closest thing to mother
in the joint.

18:58.360 --> 19:02.360
I'm careful. But I don't
lose any sleep where I am.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.120
Would you send in
the next prisoner...

19:06.120 --> 19:10.120
Patient.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.280
Good, got you alone.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.120
How did you know Richard
and I were refinancing?

19:27.120 --> 19:28.640
Huh?

19:28.640 --> 19:32.640
Oh, alone, as in a cappella.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.200
Helen, in the past 10 years,

19:35.200 --> 19:38.920
you've had two husbands and a lover,
at least that I'm aware of, right?

19:38.920 --> 19:41.840
Are you looking for advice
or a chance to see stars?

19:41.840 --> 19:44.880
No no, no no, I'm not
putting you down, honest.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.240
It's just, well, I think I'm
beginning to understand why.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.600
You know, I can't remember the
last time I sent flowers to a woman,

19:51.600 --> 19:52.880
or even wanted to.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.240
But, Carol, you see...

19:56.240 --> 20:00.000
I look at her and
all I want to do is...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.200
Well, I'm not sure...

20:01.200 --> 20:02.520
Well, I'm not sure...
Yeah, I know what you mean

20:02.520 --> 20:05.240
and frankly Donald,
I'm really a little surprised.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.960
I didn't think sniffing after pretty
med students was quite your style.

20:08.960 --> 20:09.880
That's what I'm doing?

20:09.880 --> 20:10.960
That's what I'm doing?
Oh come on, Don!

20:10.960 --> 20:14.680
You're director of medicine for
heaven's sake, you're a role model.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.840
Never mind that Carol is
20 years younger than you are.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.520
Never mind that Carol is
20 years younger than you are.
18.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.880
I gather you're not
too thrilled about this?

20:20.880 --> 20:23.360
Accurate diagnosis.

20:23.360 --> 20:27.320
Yeah. Well, to tell you
the truth I'm not either.

20:27.320 --> 20:31.320
At my age there's a certain
comfort in predictability, patterns.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.960
I don't know if I have enough
room in my life for another person.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
Well, Lizzie and Tommy of course.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.960
Well, Lizzie and Tommy of course.
 Maturity rears its seasoned head.

20:39.960 --> 20:43.960
But another part of me says, "What
the hell? Take a chance, you know?"

20:45.960 --> 20:48.840
Unfortunately Donald,
you represent a higher ideal

20:48.840 --> 20:50.400
    to most people around here.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.880
Yeah, well I think that stinks.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.440
It glanced off a rib.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.640
You're lucky the knife
didn't puncture a lung.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.160
How'd it happen?

21:01.160 --> 21:04.280
How do you think it happened?
I got stabbed.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.520
Who did it?

21:05.520 --> 21:07.600
                        You for real?

21:07.600 --> 21:11.600
                      Is he for real?

21:13.560 --> 21:16.040
A word to the wise, Doctor.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.760
Curiosity killed the cat.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.920
Right.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.000
What's the problem?

21:22.000 --> 21:25.600
               My back is killing me.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.000
                Morrison, St Elegius.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.800
Who are you?

21:28.800 --> 21:32.680
Name's McAllister,
don't you remember? Two years ago?

21:32.680 --> 21:35.360
No, I treat a lot of patients.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.040
           A bomb went off in a bank.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.280
Killed a woman?
Kathryn McAllister?

21:40.280 --> 21:44.280
You took care of the scum
who murdered my wife.

21:44.280 --> 21:48.280
       It's good to see you!

21:50.120 --> 21:54.120
He was just sitting there in a
wheelchair, it was a piece of cake.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.480
The judge said it was
premeditated and cold blooded.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.800
No!

22:00.800 --> 22:02.760
  Of course it was premeditated!

22:02.760 --> 22:04.320
  I had to go out and buy a gun.

22:04.320 --> 22:08.240
    But it wasn't cold blooded.

22:08.240 --> 22:12.040
Killing him was the most passionate
thing I've ever done in my life.

22:12.040 --> 22:16.040
And lift.

22:16.560 --> 22:20.520
      I couldn't see anything else...

22:20.520 --> 22:22.280
          ..I couldn't hear anything.

22:22.280 --> 22:26.280
    It was like a laser, total focus.

22:27.240 --> 22:31.240
When I shot the gun
I could breathe again.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.280
        I must have really loved her.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.120
                             Kathryn.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.840
I  guess so.

22:41.840 --> 22:45.840
       Now I can barely see her face.

22:45.880 --> 22:49.120
First six months in here
I was fresh meat.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.640
And I'd never even been
in a fist fight in my life.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.040
                        Spent my days

22:54.040 --> 22:56.800
working in the prison packing plant,
cutting up beef,

22:56.800 --> 22:58.840
and my nights
fighting off the creeps.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.840
What happened?

23:03.400 --> 23:06.600
          I became this lifer's punk.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.800
                           His Jenny.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.240
Jenny?

23:11.240 --> 23:14.400
                               Slave.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.600
                     I belong to him.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.360
    I do anything he wants, anything.

23:20.360 --> 23:24.360
                      He protects me.

23:26.080 --> 23:29.400
Even if I walked out of here
tomorrow, I'd never be the same,

23:29.400 --> 23:33.400
                      not like I was.

23:34.440 --> 23:38.440
 But I'm not going anywhere tomorrow.

23:38.440 --> 23:42.440
I'm not going anywhere
for a long time.

23:44.720 --> 23:48.720
You've got a spasm in your back,
you probably strained a muscle.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.080
          Do me a favour.

23:54.080 --> 23:56.440
     Keep me in the infirmary.

23:56.440 --> 24:00.440
We don't have the beds.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.160
       I need this off time.

24:02.160 --> 24:05.800
Sorry. I...I can give you
    some aspirin for the pain.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.040
Give me a shot, Demerol,
morphine, anything.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.080
Give me a shot, Demerol,
morphine, anything.
You don't need it.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.840
         I don't need it.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.000
         I don't need it.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.120
I've been down in
the mine two years. Two years!

24:17.120 --> 24:21.120
Sorry.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.920
You are one sorry sucker.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.720
Ehrlich. Do you want to see me?

24:40.720 --> 24:41.520
No, sir.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.640
No, sir.
Then why are you hovering?

24:43.640 --> 24:46.840
I came to say I'm looking forward
to returning to surgery.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.200
That goes without saying.
You look flushed.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.840
Me, sir? Must have OD'd
on the Niacin this morning.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.840
Well, rest up, we have to repair
Miss Cunningham's Tetralogy of
    Fallot  tomorrow morning.

24:57.000 --> 24:57.840
Oh, and Ehrlich?

24:57.840 --> 24:58.920
Oh, and Ehrlich?
Yes, sir.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.680
My wife came in to OB GYN
today for some tests.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.880
Find the chucklehead
                who examined her,

25:03.880 --> 25:06.560
tell him I am growing old
           waiting for the results.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.600
Better still, track down the
chart yourself and bring it to me,

25:09.600 --> 25:12.480
I'll meet you in my office.

25:12.480 --> 25:16.480
Chop, chop, chop!

25:26.520 --> 25:29.120
The nurse told me you
were up here working.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.200
How are you feeling?

25:30.200 --> 25:32.880
Like old newsprint,
yellow and brittle.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.200
Hands are much better though.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.440
Hands are much better though.
Good.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.760
Huh!

25:36.760 --> 25:40.240
I'll take my view
over this one any day.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.080
You must come down the shore
some time and visit me.

25:43.080 --> 25:43.920
I'd like that.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.360
I'd like that.
And bring Dr Westphall.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.360
You're trying hard not to be
interested in that guy, aren't you?

25:53.280 --> 25:55.360
Oh, I'm stuck.

25:55.360 --> 25:59.360
Here, see if you can help me,
come on.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.720
                       You hate it? &gt;

26:06.720 --> 26:09.040
No, no, I love it. &gt;

26:09.040 --> 26:13.040
I'm a cartoonist,
I can take the truth.

26:14.520 --> 26:18.320
We think we can bring the arthritis
under control with indomethacin.

26:18.320 --> 26:22.320
Oh, that's good news. But your mouth
wouldn't turn down at the corners

26:23.120 --> 26:27.120
if everything was coming up roses.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.040
You have what's called
Oat Cell Carcinoma.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.800
It's a type that spreads rapidly
to other parts of your body.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.040
It's a type that spreads rapidly
to other parts of your body.
Is there a cure?

26:37.040 --> 26:40.160
We get closer every day.

26:40.160 --> 26:44.160
How long have I got, while I'm
waiting for a breakthrough?

26:44.520 --> 26:48.520
Well, with aggressive chemotherapy,
a year, maybe two.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.160
104 Sunday editions.

26:51.160 --> 26:54.160
I read the rest of
the paper too, Carol.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.040
I know what chemo
and radiation therapy can do.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.560
I'll have to spend most
of my time in hospitals

26:59.560 --> 27:01.000
and I'll be too weak to work.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.280
Not everybody
experiences side-effects.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.920
If you don't get the treatment,
you won't have any chance at all.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.920
Sit down.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.760
I became a cartoonist
for freedom of thought. Lifestyle.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.120
Now, what you're asking me
to do will change who I am.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.960
It'll put a limit on my imagination

27:23.960 --> 27:27.960
and it's going to affect the
characters too. In subtle ways.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.200
They'll become callous
and desperate and angry.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.760
Sounds like a law firm, doesn't it?

27:33.760 --> 27:35.400
It doesn't have to be that way.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.280
A couple of years ago,
I got an offer from Hollywood

27:38.280 --> 27:41.680
to do an animated version
of Little Rico.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.680
Have you ever watched
TV Saturday mornings?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
It's a real duck factory.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.320
How are kids supposed to learn
anything from that garbage?

27:52.320 --> 27:55.160
I told the studio they
could keep their money.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.320
I wasn't going to sell Mayf and
Nugget and Wombat downriver

27:58.320 --> 28:00.440
for a couple of lousy bucks.

28:00.440 --> 28:04.440
And I'm not going to now,
for a lousy couple of years.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.560
All inmates from Cell Block C
  on the main line immediately.

28:11.560 --> 28:15.560
All inmates on the line.
     This is an inspection.

28:39.680 --> 28:43.680
These sores on the roof of the mouth
indicate a Vitamin-B deficiency.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.720
Loss of hair, fatigue,
are you eating?

28:47.720 --> 28:50.600
Choke down that swill every day?
You should try it.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.600
         It's enough to gag a maggot.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.760
This man has malnutrition,
I don't understand.

28:56.760 --> 28:57.920
Check out the chow.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.280
                      Yeah, right on.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.600
What? I've seen the menu.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.240
I mean, there's nothing fancy, but
it's solid, all the RDAs are there.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.960
There ain't no relation
between what's on the page

29:07.960 --> 29:11.440
             and what's on the plate.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.320
Give him a Vitamin-B booster.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.600
SIREN WAILS

29:14.600 --> 29:15.280
He'll have to wait.

29:15.280 --> 29:18.480
He'll have to wait.
What is that?

29:18.480 --> 29:22.480
Big trouble.

29:23.080 --> 29:26.120
And there's no organic source
for this woman's pain,

29:26.120 --> 29:30.120
at least none that I could find.
Dr Auschlander?

29:30.800 --> 29:34.720
With hospital service's new
computer, I can calculate department

29:34.720 --> 29:37.800
budgets. DRGs and staffing levels
are at my fingertips.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.400
I'm glad you're stepping
up to the '80s, sir, but

29:40.400 --> 29:42.000
       I'm a little pressed for time.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.320
Isn't everybody? That's why I'm
putting my life on floppy disk.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.680
This woman, you're convinced
the pain she's feeling is real?

29:48.680 --> 29:50.120
                          Absolutely.

29:50.120 --> 29:54.120
Mm-hmm. Have you any idea about
her personal life? Job pressures.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.400
                   She's a housewife.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.000
What does her husband do?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.160
                           He, erm...

29:59.160 --> 30:01.120
             He works with his hands.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.600
Manual labour.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.600
No, not exactly, he repairs...tickers

30:06.640 --> 30:08.640
   clocks and other small appliances.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.640
Detail work, very stressful.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.920
I've accessed the hacker's
bulletin board.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.440
                       Good.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.520
Are they happily married?

30:19.520 --> 30:23.520
They throw nice parties, but the
husband's gone a lot, long hours.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.480
Hmm.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.760
This is just an idea.

30:27.760 --> 30:31.760
Please, Dr Auschlander, anything, I'm
a drowning man grasping at straws.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.280
Spousal hypochondria.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.600
You think this pain
could be psychosomatic?

30:37.600 --> 30:41.240
Possibly. It's a phenomenon common
to women with husbands

30:41.240 --> 30:44.800
who are busy workaholics.
The wife feels neglected.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.800
Alone. So she develops these
symptoms in order to get attention.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.840
The ailments are quite real,
although the cause is emotional.

30:53.440 --> 30:57.440
So you think this could be
a way for this woman
to get the love she's missing?

30:57.680 --> 30:59.520
A hypothesis.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.960
           I'm a goner.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.320
&lt; Excuse me?

31:03.320 --> 31:05.000
         Nothing, nothing.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.280
If I were you,
I would sit this fella down

31:07.280 --> 31:09.480
and have a heart to heart
about his marriage.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.960
and have a heart to heart
about his marriage.
          No, I couldn't.

31:10.960 --> 31:14.960
You have to, you have a
responsibility to your patient.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.640
Believe me, Dr Auschlander,
I've met her husband,

31:17.640 --> 31:19.400
 he doesn't take advice very well.

31:19.400 --> 31:20.840
He's afraid to change.

31:20.840 --> 31:24.840
Computers used to scare
 the Dickens out of me, now look.

31:25.920 --> 31:29.440
Enter code name.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.880
I don't have one.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.880
How about Wile E Coyote?

31:45.800 --> 31:49.160
Superintendent sprang a surprise
weapons check in Cell Block C.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.320
The tough guys wouldn't leave
their cells, so we pumped in gas.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.120
What should we do?

31:53.120 --> 31:56.600
What should we do?
Keep them breathing, we've got
a small supply of isoetharine.

31:56.600 --> 32:00.600
Rotate supplies and
hope for the best.

32:02.760 --> 32:06.000
Sylvia? Come and help me
    get him in the exam room.

32:06.000 --> 32:06.920
No, we need a bull.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.920
No, we need a bull.
It's all right, come on.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.760
Just sit.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.680
You can't come in here!

32:22.680 --> 32:26.680
That's my fiance.
Is he all right?

32:27.600 --> 32:30.040
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
           Who are you?

32:30.040 --> 32:32.800
The boss of the Aryan Brotherhood.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.120
If you're white,
you gotta be right with me.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.120
We were having a little party
and the Muslims tried to crash it.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.560
Things got out of hand.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.360
Things got out of hand.
How are you feeling?

32:42.360 --> 32:43.880
                                  OK.

32:43.880 --> 32:47.880
Just sit there and rest. We're
going to go back out there, OK?

32:49.120 --> 32:51.120
Come on, let's go outside.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.800
Those punks are too mean to die.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.800
You stay and party
with us, Goldilocks!

33:02.400 --> 33:04.440
Helen, I'm changing this medication,

33:04.440 --> 33:06.880
can you make sure the bed
    gets changed as well?

33:06.880 --> 33:10.680
Sure. Um...Carol, I had a chat
with Donald about you...

33:10.680 --> 33:13.520
Look, I know I'm behind
           on my case reports and...

33:13.520 --> 33:16.120
No, no, no.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.120
Listen, he has very
strong feelings about you.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.200
We're friends.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.920
When a man who's kept himself
to himself as long as Donald has,

33:24.920 --> 33:28.440
and then he finally expresses
an interest in a woman,

33:28.440 --> 33:31.640
and that woman happens to be you...

33:31.640 --> 33:35.160
Well, I just felt that you
should know, that's all.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.080
And after cheerleading practice,

33:37.080 --> 33:40.400
maybe we can meet the boys at
the malt shop! This is infantile.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.600
I know, it's none of my business,
I shouldn't have gotten involved,

33:43.600 --> 33:46.720
I'm sorry but...
If you'd known Maureen...

33:46.720 --> 33:50.720
Well, I don't know, after talking
with Donald, maybe it's time.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.440
I have a headache.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.960
I have a headache.
        Shall I get you some aspirin?

33:53.960 --> 33:56.440
Helen, no, you've really
done enough already.

33:56.440 --> 34:00.440
Doesn't anyone in this hospital
practise medicine anymore?

34:10.360 --> 34:12.360
Were you born in a barn?

34:12.360 --> 34:13.480
A taxi cab actually.

34:13.480 --> 34:16.880
The Cabrillo Highway, somewhere
between Carmel and Monterrey.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.840
Here are Mrs Craig's test results.

34:18.840 --> 34:22.639
It's about time. Close the door and
 make sure you're on the other side.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.400
Hold it a minute!

34:24.400 --> 34:26.239
Why is your name on this chart?

34:26.239 --> 34:28.920
    Um...I performed the exam.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.920
You examined my wife's genitalia?

34:31.920 --> 34:33.600
I tried to get out of it.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.000
What's that supposed to mean?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.679
What's that supposed to mean?
Chandler and Wade can be
very uncooperative.

34:37.679 --> 34:40.960
What's wrong with my wife?

34:40.960 --> 34:44.719
Nothing. Nothing organic.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.600
What are you insinuating, Ehrlich?

34:46.600 --> 34:48.280
What are you insinuating, Ehrlich?
   I'm not insinuating anything.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.440
I'm just suggesting that
Mrs Craig's pain,

34:50.440 --> 34:53.040
which is quite acute,
has a psychosomatic origin.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.320
Dr Auschlander says that
wives of highly pressured

34:56.320 --> 34:58.760
individuals such as yourself
frequently suffer from hypochondria.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.720
individuals such as yourself
frequently suffer from hypochondria.
Did he?

35:00.720 --> 35:04.120
I, of course, kept Mrs
Craig's identity confidential.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.440
From Chandler, from Wade, from
Auschlander. How about Luther?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.560
I couldn't find him.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.840
The particular location of
Mrs Craig's pain might indicate,

35:11.840 --> 35:14.600
at least symbolically,
a marital breach, if you will,

35:14.600 --> 35:16.280
 a feeling of neglect on her part.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.960
Don't pinch a loaf of high-school
   Freud all over my wing tips!

35:19.960 --> 35:21.080
Just get out of here!

35:21.080 --> 35:23.720
Like a shot, sir.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.680
See you in surgery?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.240
Only if you're on the table!

35:27.240 --> 35:31.240
Right.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.640
Why don't we just go?

35:34.640 --> 35:37.960
You know, forget this happened?

35:37.960 --> 35:38.920
     What's he talking about?

35:38.920 --> 35:40.920
     What's he talking about?
I'm not going to report it.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.200
It's not going to count against you.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.000
It's not going to count against you.
Motes is a lifer.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.360
Unless he kills you,
he's got nothing to lose.

35:46.360 --> 35:50.360
Unless he kills you,
he's got nothing to lose.
OK, let's go.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.280
You leave her alone.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.720
I graduated nurses a long time ago.

35:58.720 --> 36:02.720
What I'm looking for now
is an eligible young doctor.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.440
You dance with me, Jenny?

36:06.440 --> 36:10.440
You dance with me, huh?

36:12.440 --> 36:13.800
Stephen...

36:13.800 --> 36:16.240
Nobody helped me, Morrison.

36:16.240 --> 36:20.240
Once the bars slam shut,
you go down the shaft.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.960
Think you're going to
enjoy this moment, Cedar.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.040
                  Jersey was adamant.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.440
Well, sometimes a doctor has to
accept the patient's wish to die.

36:50.440 --> 36:54.400
Well, sometimes a doctor has to
accept the patient's wish to die.
               Ever read Little Rico?

36:54.400 --> 36:57.080
The characters are sweet
but confused.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.360
They want something better in life,
but they don't know how to get it.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.400
If I were told
that I was going to die,

37:02.400 --> 37:06.280
they'd have to drag me kicking and
scratching all the way to my funeral.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.280
How could he be so
willing to give up?

37:08.280 --> 37:11.600
It seems Jersey's accomplished
almost everything he set out to do.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.360
Not like the rest of us,
we put off our dreams till next year
and then it's too late.

37:15.360 --> 37:18.760
Donald, do you realise
I've never been to Europe?

37:18.760 --> 37:20.440
       Or Marblehead for that matter!

37:20.440 --> 37:21.040
Come on, you're young.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.320
Come on, you're young.
                  I'm not that young.

37:22.320 --> 37:26.320
I've already spent seven years being
a nurse, realised I was unfulfilled.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.640
Now, I'm spending four more years
to become a doctor,

37:29.640 --> 37:32.760
and what if I find out
I'm still unfulfilled?

37:32.760 --> 37:36.400
Well, just don't blame me.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.720
You know...
I'm like your pal, Little Rico.

37:39.720 --> 37:43.400
I want something very much,
and I don't know how to get it.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.240
                      Why me, Donald?

37:45.240 --> 37:47.760
I don't know.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.320
I'm not sure.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.360
I'm usually pretty well-grounded,

37:51.360 --> 37:52.320
you know, but around
you I'm off balance.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.680
you know, but around
you I'm off balance.
                           I'm sorry.

37:53.680 --> 37:57.680
No! I like it.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.160
            I'm not in love with you.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.600
It's OK.

38:00.600 --> 38:04.600
Well. I promised Mr Piker I'd go by
and see him and see how he's feeling.

38:05.480 --> 38:09.360
Maybe he'll feel better,
maybe he's changed his mind.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.880
Congratulations. I heard you were
nominated for Doctor of the Year.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.240
I get nominated every year.
It doesn't mean much.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.760
Well, even so, I hope you win again.

38:16.760 --> 38:20.760
Well, even so, I hope you win again.
Thank you.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.200
                                Er...

38:23.200 --> 38:24.880
         Taking anyone to the awards?

38:24.880 --> 38:27.360
No, probably go stag, like always.

38:27.360 --> 38:31.360
                       Not this time.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.520
Still up?

38:37.520 --> 38:38.640
Still up?
                    I couldn't sleep.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.960
How's the baby.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.320
How's the baby.
                            An angel.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.520
Sorry I'm late.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.960
                             Are you?

38:43.960 --> 38:47.200
What a question?!
Of course I'm sorry.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.440
I was held up replacing
a patient's chest tube.

38:50.440 --> 38:54.240
No, I meant, are you late?
It seems like your usual hour.

38:54.240 --> 38:57.240
Well, I wanted to get home earlier.
How are you feeling?

38:57.240 --> 38:59.280
      Did the test results come back?

38:59.280 --> 39:01.880
Ehrlich dropped them by
my office this afternoon.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.880
       Poor Victor! He was so nervous

39:03.880 --> 39:07.480
I practically had to hold a gun
to him to get him to do the exam.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.000
I want you to see Sculletts
as soon as he gets back

39:10.000 --> 39:11.880
from yodelling up the Matterhorn.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.400
Then it's serious?
Did the tests...?

39:14.400 --> 39:16.600
The test showed nothing at all.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.320
Ehrlich wasn't able to find
anything wrong with you.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.840
He probably botched the job.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.080
Well, I'm feeling a
lot better right now.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.480
Come here. I want to show you
something but close your eyes first.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.200
Why should I close my eyes?
It's dark in there.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.200
All right.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
            The family.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.240
  I found this today up in the attic.

39:39.240 --> 39:42.400
     And, we never hung this picture.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.560
            I...I don't know why not.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.920
Cos I never liked it.

39:46.920 --> 39:50.920
Cos I never liked it.
Don't do that, Mark.
Everything can't always be your way.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.800
It hasn't.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.720
Ever since Stephen died,
    you've been tense, on edge

39:59.720 --> 40:02.160
and that's what's
     brought on this illness.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.120
It's all in my head,
is that what you think?

40:04.120 --> 40:05.280
It's all in my head,
is that what you think?
I didn't say that.

40:05.280 --> 40:08.920
My pain is real, Mark.
I want to know the cause of it.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.520
Me.

40:10.520 --> 40:14.520
I'm the cause.

40:19.280 --> 40:23.280
I've spent a lifetime taking
away other people's suffering.

40:29.960 --> 40:33.960
Has my absence caused
you all this pain?

40:36.920 --> 40:40.920
                 Yes, I guess it has.

40:44.440 --> 40:48.440
I can live with that for a while.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
Ellen, for what it's worth...

40:54.040 --> 40:57.640
I'm sorry.

40:57.640 --> 41:01.640
                            Oh, Mark.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.400
               I get so lonely, Mark.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.880
Helen, I seem to have
      lost a cartoonist.

41:16.880 --> 41:19.320
Have you seen Jersey Piker
wandering around?

41:19.320 --> 41:20.440
                  He was in his room.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.440
No, he's not now.

41:27.640 --> 41:31.640
Jersey, where are you?

42:17.800 --> 42:21.800
I think there's another one
in cubicle three.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.360
Jack!

42:28.360 --> 42:31.360
What the hell happened?

42:31.360 --> 42:32.440
Nothing.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.960
Get her to isolation.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.280
And call the rape team.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.280
I'm having trouble sleeping.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.240
Boomer, are you OK?

42:42.240 --> 42:46.240
I'm worried about my classes.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.600
Just relax now.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.280
I miss you so much.

42:53.280 --> 42:57.280
Just before dawn,
which is the coldest part of the day

42:57.920 --> 43:00.360
and I ought to be able to sleep
 but I can't,

43:00.360 --> 43:02.840
I get up, and I...

43:02.840 --> 43:04.920
and I go outside.

43:04.920 --> 43:08.760
And I watch the sun rise.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.960
You're gonna be amazed, Nina.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.480
Jack, I'll get you
something to help you rest.

43:14.480 --> 43:18.480
Down in the tropics, it's
unbelievable. It comes on so fast.

43:22.120 --> 43:26.080
The jungle, it's all black...

43:26.080 --> 43:28.560
and then the sky starts
     to catch on fire.

43:28.560 --> 43:32.560
Pink, orange, yellow...

43:34.120 --> 43:36.640
..blue.

43:36.640 --> 43:39.760
And the birds,

43:39.760 --> 43:43.760
they're making
this incredible racket.

43:44.680 --> 43:48.680
I think you'd better come down here.

43:49.320 --> 43:53.320
I don't want to spend
      Christmas without you.

44:04.280 --> 44:08.240
Oh, Nina.

44:08.240 --> 44:12.240
I miss you so much.

44:38.880 --> 44:47.000
