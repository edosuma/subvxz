And this is not just a delay.

13:20.561 --> 13:21.711
You're fucking with my concrete pour.

13:21.761 --> 13:23.381
You see why I'm confused.

13:23.431 --> 13:25.251
Well, this is out of our hands.

13:25.301 --> 13:27.251
There's a shortage of gravel.

13:27.301 --> 13:29.421
[laughs]

13:29.471 --> 13:30.991
You ran out of rocks.

13:31.041 --> 13:34.061
Special rocks.
Watsonville-McCoy number four.

13:34.111 --> 13:36.031
We're building so close to a seismic fault,

13:36.081 --> 13:38.161
we have to go with prestressed concrete.

13:38.211 --> 13:40.031
This gravel's just mandatory for the mix.

13:40.081 --> 13:42.841
When until we get these
magical earthquake rocks?

13:42.891 --> 13:45.511
Two, three weeks at the most.

13:45.561 --> 13:47.541
We'll keep you posted.

13:47.591 --> 13:49.981
Oh, you'll keep me posted.

13:50.031 --> 13:52.511
But if I call around
and luck up on somebody

13:52.561 --> 13:54.251
who has these rocks, then we're still good

13:54.301 --> 13:55.621
for next week, right?

13:55.671 --> 13:59.421
[speaking Spanish]

13:59.471 --> 14:02.621
Yeah, Pernell is not getting suspended,

14:02.671 --> 14:04.621
and you need to stop hitting
the brakes on this deal

14:04.671 --> 14:06.891
every time he gets a
goddamn parking ticket, man.

14:06.941 --> 14:08.761
It's time we make this
relationship permanent.

14:08.811 --> 14:10.561
We're not making anything permanent

14:10.611 --> 14:12.831
till we know Pernell's permanent.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.971
Get the presiding judge on the phone.

14:23.331 --> 14:24.581
You got his number?

14:25.631 --> 14:28.081
BOBO: It's a she.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.951
I did exactly what PJ
said. He never woke up.

14:33.001 --> 14:34.721
Not even a twitch.

14:34.771 --> 14:37.991
Not yet, but that doesn't
mean he'll never wake up.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.731
I get that... God's time and all,

14:39.781 --> 14:41.361
but you said I was on a righteous path.

14:41.411 --> 14:42.931
And I said you would be tested.

14:42.981 --> 14:46.601
We never know how long a path
is until we reach the end of it.

14:46.651 --> 14:48.101
How do I know this shit's gonna work?

14:48.151 --> 14:49.301
Well, you have to trust.

14:49.351 --> 14:51.471
- Like Simon did.
- Exactly.

14:51.521 --> 14:52.771
In Luke 5, Jesus pointed

14:52.821 --> 14:54.471
to the water and told Simon,

14:54.521 --> 14:55.881
"Drop your nets."

14:55.931 --> 14:57.741
Simon said, "You're crazy, man.

14:57.791 --> 14:59.851
I already tried that spot.
There's no fish there.

14:59.901 --> 15:02.381
I know 'cause this is what I do.

15:02.431 --> 15:04.151
I'm a fish expert."

15:04.201 --> 15:07.251
And Jesus said, "You know
what I'm an expert in?

15:07.301 --> 15:10.691
Listening to God."

15:10.741 --> 15:12.561
And when Simon laid down those nets,

15:12.611 --> 15:14.661
he caught so many fish,
the boat almost sank.

15:14.711 --> 15:16.531
You know what? Good for Simon.

15:16.581 --> 15:19.061
But I did what God said, and I got nothing.

15:19.111 --> 15:21.731
And I did way more than throw in some nets.

15:21.781 --> 15:24.001
CRYSTAL: Pernell...

15:27.361 --> 15:29.011
Oh.

15:34.261 --> 15:35.921
Hello.

15:43.741 --> 15:46.961
Don't mind me.

15:47.011 --> 15:51.131
You're Aunt Val called.
Dinner tomorrow night.

15:51.181 --> 15:53.631
She insisted.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.321
Maybe we should leave.

16:13.371 --> 16:16.821
Just hang on a second.

16:16.871 --> 16:19.961
Look, now, if God is testing my faith,

16:20.011 --> 16:23.101
He's not starting out with the easy stuff,

16:23.151 --> 16:25.701
so you're just telling me
just do whatever God says,

16:25.751 --> 16:29.071
even if... just do what He says,

16:29.121 --> 16:30.401
and PJ'll wake up?

16:30.451 --> 16:33.011
- If it's in God's plan.
- "If"?

16:33.061 --> 16:35.681
Well, "if" just isn't enough.

16:39.431 --> 16:44.221
If you follow God's instruction...

16:44.271 --> 16:46.151
PJ will wake up.

16:46.201 --> 16:49.191
I guarantee it.

16:59.951 --> 17:02.231
It'd be better if we
can talk in your office.

17:02.281 --> 17:04.101
I think it'd be better
if I was fucking Beyoncé,

17:04.151 --> 17:05.441
but I'm not Jay Z.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.070
And I'm not canceling my lunch

17:07.121 --> 17:09.641
for some shit you could've
told me over the phone.

17:09.691 --> 17:12.011
Shane Caldwell's missing.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.851
It's the cop.

17:16.131 --> 17:17.721
Sit down.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.461
When you say missing, you mean, like...

17:23.511 --> 17:26.761
1-800, "side of a fucking
milk carton" missing,

17:26.810 --> 17:28.060
like his wife is asking me

17:28.111 --> 17:29.631
why I brought him in for questioning.

17:29.681 --> 17:30.961
Maybe had something to do with that.

17:31.011 --> 17:32.631
Don't worry... I left out the part

17:32.681 --> 17:34.901
where you strong-armed me into
interrogating him for a lunatic.

17:34.951 --> 17:37.701
- I told her it was unrelated.
- No to "strong-arm." Yes to "unrelated."

17:37.751 --> 17:39.541
I made Shane strip naked for Pernell

17:39.591 --> 17:41.671
'cause he refused to believe
he didn't rape Jocelyn.

17:41.721 --> 17:43.211
How do I know he left it at that?

17:43.261 --> 17:45.241
That was a grieving father
in the heat of the moment.

17:45.291 --> 17:47.481
What you need to do is stop
looking for conspiracies

17:47.531 --> 17:50.421
and focus on finding Caldwell.

17:58.941 --> 18:02.031
[indistinct chatter]

18:06.851 --> 18:08.071
Save my place.

18:27.071 --> 18:30.721
So have you spoken to the Lord?

18:30.771 --> 18:32.391
You were right.

18:32.441 --> 18:35.531
He wants us to find out
who Shane was working for.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.701
But he didn't say who?

18:37.751 --> 18:38.901
I haven't figured that out yet,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.731
but the night Shane raped Jocelyn,

18:41.781 --> 18:43.741
he said he was on a vandalism case.

18:43.791 --> 18:45.241
The police have a file

18:45.291 --> 18:48.741
complete with pictures
of graffiti, everything.

18:48.791 --> 18:50.411
So you think Shane had help?

18:50.461 --> 18:52.381
I'm gonna start there.

18:52.431 --> 18:55.611
- KD.
- Yeah?

18:55.661 --> 18:59.221
- Donation time.
- Okay.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.951
Thanks, man.

19:03.041 --> 19:07.191
I got to go take my pee test.

19:07.241 --> 19:10.031
We can't meet here anymore.

19:10.081 --> 19:11.961
Somebody spots us, they're gonna ask

19:12.011 --> 19:14.771
a whole lot of questions
I don't want to answer.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.341
You got to move.

19:17.391 --> 19:20.841
Oh, oh, uh...

19:20.891 --> 19:23.181
I can't really move right now,

19:23.231 --> 19:25.181
but maybe...

19:25.231 --> 19:26.911
there's a phone booth not far...

19:26.961 --> 19:29.381
I'm not gonna call you. That's even worse.

19:29.431 --> 19:31.881
- You want to be my Benaiah?
- Yeah, you know I do.

19:31.931 --> 19:35.761
Well, then you're gonna have to move.

19:35.811 --> 19:37.561
They won't let me.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.031
Rules say I can't move unless I have a job.

19:40.081 --> 19:43.161
Well, what do you do? You
just sit on your ass all day?

19:43.211 --> 19:46.071
No, I'm not... I'm not lazy.

19:46.121 --> 19:48.231
I'm not lazy, Judge Harris.

19:48.281 --> 19:51.101
Men like me getting a job,
that's easier said than done.

19:51.151 --> 19:53.111
Oh, come on, man. Don't
be singing that song to me.

19:53.161 --> 19:54.971
I know there's programs for cons.

19:55.021 --> 19:57.611
I put in every week.

19:57.661 --> 19:58.981
Place like McDonald's will take you

19:59.031 --> 20:00.781
if you got a felony,
but not if it's violent.

20:00.831 --> 20:04.781
I got hired by a landscaper last week
until the background check came in.

20:04.831 --> 20:08.151
He fired me the next day. He said it
wasn't me, but if the customers find out...

20:08.201 --> 20:10.091
Keith, I'm not coming down here anymore.

20:10.141 --> 20:12.221
- You understand that?
- Then let me come to you!

20:12.271 --> 20:16.601
Please, please, don't...
don't cut me loose.

20:17.881 --> 20:19.061
You're my calling.

20:19.111 --> 20:20.371
All right, all right, settle down.

20:20.421 --> 20:22.001
I'm not cutting anybody loose.

20:22.051 --> 20:25.201
- You need a job?
- [exhales sharply]

20:25.251 --> 20:28.141
I may know somebody who's hiring.

20:30.431 --> 20:32.881
Thank you, Judge Harris.

20:36.971 --> 20:39.151
Hey, Keith.

20:41.901 --> 20:44.091
I keep seeing his face

20:44.141 --> 20:46.431
when I go to sleep at night.

20:50.011 --> 20:54.531
- That ever happen to you?
- No, sir.

20:54.581 --> 20:56.241
Shane was guilty,

20:56.291 --> 20:59.541
and he found Jesus before he died.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.941
I'm content with that.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.851
NICK: Why do you want to
take PJ off life support?

21:07.901 --> 21:10.151
Why not wait another two months? Two weeks?

21:10.201 --> 21:13.291
Because he can't be revived.

21:13.341 --> 21:14.721
JOCELYN: I mean, I mean, um...

21:14.771 --> 21:15.991
She deserves to move on.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.991
JOSH: So does PJ.

21:18.041 --> 21:19.891
And how do you play into this, Mr. Miller?

21:19.941 --> 21:22.361
- You two related?
- No, we're friends.

21:22.411 --> 21:26.671
PJ's my... was my best friend.

21:26.721 --> 21:28.101
I'm here to support.

21:28.151 --> 21:32.071
But this is your decision, Jocelyn, hmm?

21:33.791 --> 21:35.611
Listen, I can't imagine
what you're going through,

21:35.661 --> 21:37.411
and I know you want to do the right thing,

21:37.461 --> 21:40.881
but cases like this destroy people.

21:40.931 --> 21:43.181
That's the price. Nonnegotiable.

21:43.231 --> 21:45.651
And you're talking about
taking on the Harris family.

21:45.701 --> 21:48.421
I'm sure you know better
than me what that means.

21:48.471 --> 21:50.621
Oh, you don't think she can win?

21:50.671 --> 21:52.761
I don't think she's ready
for what it would take to win.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.431
You met her five minutes ago.
You don't know how strong she is.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.531
But I know you're doing all the talking.

21:57.581 --> 22:00.801
It's not a good sign. In fact,
why don't you step outside

22:00.851 --> 22:02.801
while I finish talking
to my prospective client?

22:02.851 --> 22:05.341
- Seriously?
- Or casually.

22:05.391 --> 22:08.041
As long as you end up on
the other side of that door.

22:10.991 --> 22:13.211
It's okay.

22:25.341 --> 22:28.291
Jocelyn, the people who win these cases

22:28.341 --> 22:30.961
walk into my office spitting fire,

22:31.011 --> 22:33.401
and I need that fire,

22:33.451 --> 22:35.731
because winning has just as
much to do with perception

22:35.781 --> 22:37.271
as it does with the law.

22:37.321 --> 22:39.201
I would have to trot
you out front and center

22:39.251 --> 22:42.171
to the media, the judge,

22:42.221 --> 22:45.141
and Heaven forbid we go
to trial, the jury too.

22:45.191 --> 22:47.481
This is not a dig,
certainly not a judgment,

22:47.531 --> 22:49.381
but you walked in my
office wearing flip-flops.

22:49.431 --> 22:51.281
You're not looking for a fight.

22:51.331 --> 22:54.121
You want this to be over.
There's no shame in that.

22:54.171 --> 22:58.391
A lot of people would say
it's the more enlightened path.

22:58.441 --> 23:02.291
So, if there's any way you
can get on with your life

23:02.341 --> 23:06.071
without going to court,
that's what I would do.

23:08.151 --> 23:10.371
Thank you for your time.

23:14.891 --> 23:18.081
[whirring]

23:26.601 --> 23:28.091
[shredder whirring]

23:30.541 --> 23:33.191
So this is the vandalism
report Shane filed?

23:33.241 --> 23:36.101
Doesn't say who made the 911 call.

23:36.151 --> 23:38.501
It was anonymous.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.171
What about the owner of the building?

23:41.221 --> 23:45.101
Report says she was out of town.

23:46.761 --> 23:48.671
[sighs]

23:50.561 --> 23:52.481
Wait a minute.

23:58.701 --> 24:01.551
- Who painted this graffiti?
- I don't know.

24:01.601 --> 24:04.491
We usually don't follow up on vandalism.

24:04.541 --> 24:07.031
Police reports are usually
for insurance claims.

24:07.081 --> 24:09.731
Anything particular you're looking for?

24:09.781 --> 24:11.301
I was hoping...

24:13.921 --> 24:16.601
Are you okay?

24:18.651 --> 24:21.711
Look, if you want me to do
some groundwork on graffiti,

24:21.761 --> 24:24.081
I'd be more than happy to.

24:24.131 --> 24:28.351
No, no, it's okay, Sergeant.
Thanks very much. You did plenty.

24:28.401 --> 24:31.451
Well, if you, uh...

24:31.501 --> 24:33.691
I'll be around if you need me.

24:40.441 --> 24:41.491
Judge.

24:45.911 --> 24:49.471
[device whirring loudly]

24:58.331 --> 25:00.181
- Shit.
- Hey.

25:01.661 --> 25:04.681
[sighs]

25:04.731 --> 25:07.121
I'll take care of this, Sister Alicia.

25:07.171 --> 25:08.351
Oh.

25:12.171 --> 25:14.591
Thank you.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.871
It's gonna be real nice
having you around, KD.

25:26.161 --> 25:28.571
There's a table in the back room.

25:30.791 --> 25:34.481
What's "100% Wood"?

25:34.531 --> 25:37.021
- What?
- Your tattoo.

25:37.071 --> 25:38.751
That's, um...

25:38.801 --> 25:41.421
from a long time ago.

25:41.471 --> 25:43.321
Hmm, eh.

25:43.371 --> 25:45.321
I got this when I was 16.

25:45.371 --> 25:48.561
It's supposed to symbolize my free spirit.

25:48.611 --> 25:51.401
Mm-hmm. It's pretty.

25:51.451 --> 25:54.131
- It's stupid.
- [grunts]

25:54.181 --> 25:56.741
What does yours mean?

25:56.791 --> 26:00.141
Oh, it's stupid too.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.571
Are you gonna tell me?

26:06.361 --> 26:08.751
It's a White Power gang.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.351
"Wood" stands for "peckerwood."

26:19.111 --> 26:20.561
Oh.

40:30.491 --> 40:33.541
and you still threw the
case out without explanation?

40:33.591 --> 40:36.081
There's no way that this
doesn't at least go to review.

40:36.131 --> 40:37.151
Who heads the committee?

40:37.201 --> 40:38.681
- I do.
- That's right.

40:38.731 --> 40:40.321
Because you're the presiding judge.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.321
Who made you the presiding judge?

40:42.371 --> 40:45.561
- I was elected.
- [chuckles]

40:45.611 --> 40:48.031
You didn't win your position.

40:48.081 --> 40:52.931
It was a gift from Pernell to you.

40:52.981 --> 40:54.001
And I will always be grateful,

40:54.051 --> 40:55.771
but I will not break the rules.

40:55.821 --> 40:59.371
Wow.

40:59.421 --> 41:03.841
Um, can I get a bottle
of Dos Maestros, 2011?

41:03.891 --> 41:05.041
You got it.

41:05.091 --> 41:08.051
We need some light in here.

41:08.101 --> 41:11.621
So how's Greg doing? I hear
the brewery's getting some buzz.

41:11.671 --> 41:14.051
Yeah, seems to be catching on.

41:14.101 --> 41:17.521
That's what Paul O'Neill over at San
Vicente Bank and Trust was telling me.

41:17.571 --> 41:20.791
I really admire people that
strike out on their own.

41:20.841 --> 41:23.831
Paul also mentioned something about, um...

41:23.881 --> 41:26.201
a cash-flow problem,

41:26.251 --> 41:30.371
that Greg was looking to
extend a line of credit...

41:30.421 --> 41:33.171
again.

41:35.991 --> 41:38.281
Boy, sure hope that works out.

41:39.761 --> 41:42.481
There's nothing I can do until the hearing,

41:42.531 --> 41:44.381
but then I promise I'm gonna make sure...

41:44.431 --> 41:47.721
There's not gonna be any public hearing.

41:47.771 --> 41:50.521
You're gonna handle this
in a closed-door session.

41:50.571 --> 41:53.721
[scoffs] I do that, people are gonna know

41:53.771 --> 41:55.361
that I'm giving you preferential treatment.

41:55.411 --> 41:58.101
I'll open myself up to an ethics review.

41:58.151 --> 42:00.101
That could happen.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.131
Probably won't, but it could.

42:02.181 --> 42:03.801
And if it does,

42:03.851 --> 42:07.411
well, then you know you
got me to protect you.

42:07.461 --> 42:10.111
The question you should
really be asking yourself is,

42:10.161 --> 42:13.311
if you don't side with us here,

42:13.361 --> 42:15.481
who's gonna protect you from me?

42:20.171 --> 42:22.751
Okay, wait.

42:22.801 --> 42:26.121
If you can get McCauley
to pull his complaint,

42:26.171 --> 42:27.561
I can make it all go away

42:27.611 --> 42:29.561
and not end my career in the process.

42:29.611 --> 42:31.431
Yes, we can get McCauley to back off.

42:33.051 --> 42:36.131
MAN: Wine's on the way. Ready to order?

42:36.181 --> 42:37.671
I was thinking halibut,

42:37.721 --> 42:39.901
but I don't want to offend
our little friend here.

42:39.951 --> 42:41.971
Oh, don't worry about him.

42:42.021 --> 42:43.811
He's coming with me.

42:43.861 --> 42:46.641
Aren't you? Enjoy the wine.

42:59.341 --> 43:03.161
I'm taking Pernell to court for PJ,

43:03.211 --> 43:04.931
and I want you to be my lawyer.

43:08.421 --> 43:11.171
ALICIA: It's beautiful.

43:11.221 --> 43:12.901
PERNELL: It's for PJ.

43:15.391 --> 43:18.511
He loves fish.

43:18.561 --> 43:21.781
That's a wonderful gesture.

43:21.831 --> 43:25.181
And I think it's great
what you did for KD too,

43:25.231 --> 43:26.881
helping him get a job.

43:29.401 --> 43:31.361
Of course things are gonna be much tighter

43:31.411 --> 43:34.561
now that he's on the payroll.

43:34.611 --> 43:37.201
$50,000 didn't loosen the noose enough

43:37.251 --> 43:39.301
to pay for a handyman?

43:39.351 --> 43:42.531
Well, that money's gone a long way already.

43:42.581 --> 43:44.241
You know we're putting in a new kitchen

43:44.291 --> 43:47.241
to feed the homeless thanks to you.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.111
We just didn't budget for a new employee.

43:50.161 --> 43:53.341
Are you asking me to write a check

43:53.391 --> 43:55.211
so that you can pay for KD?

43:55.261 --> 43:56.681
No, Brother Pernell,

43:56.731 --> 43:59.881
that's not what I had in mind at all.

44:09.481 --> 44:12.331
Have you ever heard Paul play the piano?

44:16.281 --> 44:18.271
Tell 'em who you are.
Tell 'em what you want.

44:18.321 --> 44:21.311

- Okay.

44:53.091 --> 44:57.381
but if honoring his wishes
means going to court...

44:59.061 --> 45:01.281

you couldn't have children.

- It's not the same.

I even told you to give up.

No, I don't.
