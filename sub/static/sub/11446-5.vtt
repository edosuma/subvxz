00:04.171 --> 00:05.206
Allow me to introduce an old friend...

00:36.161 --> 00:37.367
It's La Dame Blanche!

00:43.085 --> 00:44.075
Summon the gens d'armes.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.002
The new shipment has arrived.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.204
Would you like a sample?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.627
Start without me. I'll join you later.

08:29.759 --> 08:30.794
Very good.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.147
Will that be all, gentlemen?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.394
Or maybe two?

22:03.489 --> 22:04.650
Not tonight Madame.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.653
Suit yourselves.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.299
I share your distaste for our partnership.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.344
My memory never fails.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.809
I haven't forgotten your wife's...
...callous attempt to ruin me.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.749
Your personal life is of no interest to me.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.874
Absolutely none at all.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.467
I, alone, will procure the shipment.

23:17.813 --> 23:21.397
It will be secured at my warehouse...
...until you have buyers in place.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.224
Contact me then...

23:24.570 --> 23:25.560
...and not before.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.404
What a pleasure!

29:48.120 --> 29:51.033
Lovely to see you again, Annalise.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.206
I was about to take a walk
through the garden.

29:54.668 --> 29:55.783
Will you join me?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.078
It would be a pleasure.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.013
After you, Madame.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.519
Allow me to introduce myself.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.097
Captain Jonathan Wolverton Randall...

33:47.609 --> 33:51.352
...of His Britannic Majesty's
8th Dragoons.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.605
At you service, Madame.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.282
Annalise de Marillac.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.115
A pleasure to make your acquaintance.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.189
Madame Fraser...

36:01.159 --> 36:02.820
The King takes great pleasure
in seeing you again.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.823
As I do you, Your Majesty.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.496
Your Majesty, may I present to you...

36:12.045 --> 36:14.332
...Jonathan Wolverton Randall,

36:14.547 --> 36:18.666
Captain of His Britannic
Majesty's 8th Dragoons.

36:19.761 --> 36:23.299
Captain Randall...
Welcome to Versailles.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.285
I assure you, that your
accent is flawless...

36:52.127 --> 36:53.117
...as always.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.244
Your Majesty is far too kind.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.170
Your Majesty...

40:35.725 --> 40:38.012
lam feeling... ...unwell.

40:38.144 --> 40:41.307
With your permission, may I retire?

40:42.690 --> 40:46.228
Be well, Madame Fraser.
Take some rest.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.978
Take me to the Bastille...
...with all due haste.
