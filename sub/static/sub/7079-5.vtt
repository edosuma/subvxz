WEBVTT

00:03.253 --> 00:04.413
Why did Frankie call us here?

00:04.546 --> 00:06.590
I don't know. Some
financial prospect

00:06.882 --> 00:08.550
that could put the
school in the black.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.762
Which always confuses me,
because black means bad...

00:12.763 --> 00:14.848
when it's a cat or a banana

00:15.140 --> 00:16.683
or a shirt that makes you think

00:16.975 --> 00:18.602
you've lost more weight
than you have.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.687
Nice save.
Sorry about that, man.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.981
Hmm? What?

00:23.273 --> 00:24.553
Did someone
use the word "black,"

00:24.650 --> 00:26.450
and now you want me
to give you the all clear?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.338
Please tell me that won't be
my role in this group.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.863
I have a brain
the size of Jupiter.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.198
- I'm nobody's fourth Ghostbuster.
- No.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.952
I promise. This group
does not think that way.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.079
In fact, before you got here,

00:37.371 --> 00:39.331
they had two... No!

00:39.623 --> 00:40.623
They had to...

00:40.791 --> 00:41.959
often...

00:42.251 --> 00:43.669
step back and remind themselves

00:43.961 --> 00:45.761
that they weren't
one collective ray of light.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.633
Is this a cult?
Are you gonna eat me?

00:49.925 --> 00:52.344
No. We're fine.
I lived in New York.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.888
Speaking of which,
midterms are over,

00:55.180 --> 00:56.658
and I was thinking
we could have a party

00:56.682 --> 00:58.517
at our apartment. Abed? Annie?

00:58.809 --> 00:59.935
You can have a party. Yes!

01:00.227 --> 01:01.520
You can't have a rager.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.612
We have a rule against
more than eight guests.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.066
Eight guests? That's
not "not a rager."

01:06.358 --> 01:07.401
That's not a party.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.194
- Nice grammar.
- Okay.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.326
You have a rule against
parties, which I'm sure

01:11.363 --> 01:13.282
is a world record
for uptightness,

01:13.574 --> 01:14.741
so let's celebrate that.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.286
I'll bring the booze
and more than eight guests.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.121
Britta, you just moved in.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.708
You don't even have a real bedroom.
You're a coucher.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.668
She sleeps... on the couch!

01:24.960 --> 01:26.169
She's a coucher!

01:26.461 --> 01:27.504
So I get nothing?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.840
You get a couch. You get a home.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.925
There's no government
to overthrow here.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.237
I'm not overthrowing... You're
overthrowing if I say so.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.429
Nice irony.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.041
Can we focus on this?
Because now,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.308
this is happening.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.186
Hello, everyone.
Don't be alarmed.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.105
I'm attending our meeting

01:45.397 --> 01:47.649
using what's called
a telepresence robot.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.985
I resent the idea
that this would alarm me.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.030
These bots have been revolutionizing
the private sector,

01:53.322 --> 01:54.948
and now the state of Colorado

01:55.240 --> 01:57.326
has come to us with a unique...

02:04.958 --> 02:05.958
Proposition.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.294
Seamless, Frankie.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.630
The Department of Corrections
will pay us money

02:09.920 --> 02:12.507
if we allow a small,
manageable number of inmates

02:12.799 --> 02:15.302
to attend Greendale using these.

02:15.594 --> 02:16.594
Now, hold on.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.405
Are you trying to tell me
that prisoners

02:18.430 --> 02:21.016
would use these things
to come to our school?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.988
That's the
black guy in every sci-fi movie.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.479
I'll allow it.

02:25.771 --> 02:29.358
Wait. Prisoners? Rolling around
the school with students?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.443
They'll rape us.
They'll rape us all.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.278
They can't rape you

02:33.570 --> 02:36.990
because their genitals will be
hundreds of miles away.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.700
From each other?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.160
This is an attempt

02:40.452 --> 02:41.703
at rehabilitation.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.998
The prison is looking for ways
to expose their inmates

02:45.290 --> 02:48.043
- to a real-world academic environment.
- Okay.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.420
I've heard enough. I'm
responsible for this school.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.952
I won't have hardened criminals

02:52.172 --> 02:53.715
exposing themselves to it.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.652
That's the response they're
getting from everyone,

02:55.676 --> 03:00.514
which is why the state is
offering a $300,000 incentive...

03:00.806 --> 03:03.183
we'll do it. Dean, do it. $300,000
for the school.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.475
They're convicts!

03:04.601 --> 03:06.061
They're iPads on sticks.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.771
As someone that got paid to keep

03:08.063 --> 03:09.856
- people out, let me tell you...
- Hey, guys.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.358
I'm moonwalking.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.193
Not every bad guy
ends up in prison,

03:13.485 --> 03:15.070
and not every prisoner
is a bad guy.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.363
Who's this guy?

03:16.655 --> 03:18.532
300,000! Oh, yeah.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.702
Jeffrey, you know, ordinarily
I'd do anything you say.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.120
Do it. Let's do it.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.830
Well, I walked into that one.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.165
Gross! Who farted?

03:27.457 --> 03:29.251
Oh, wait, never mind.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.587
♪ Give me some rope
Tie me to dream

03:32.879 --> 03:35.757
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam

03:36.049 --> 03:39.177
♪ Somebody said it can be here

03:39.469 --> 03:43.181
♪ We could be roped up
tied up, dead in a year

03:43.473 --> 03:48.353
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay

03:48.645 --> 03:52.399
♪ One by one they all
just fade away ♪

03:59.948 --> 04:02.492
I'm so glad
you talked me into this.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.327
$300,000.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.662
Look at us!

04:05.954 --> 04:07.664
Running the school together. Oh.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.541
If I'm running the school,
pay me more.

04:09.833 --> 04:14.129
What if I made
you professor emeritus?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.380
We could have a little ceremony.
Does it pay more?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.841
No. Then give me what the
ceremony would cost.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.762
Okay, folks. Welcome.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.431
I believe you all have
maps of our campus.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.099
Oh, and this is your Dean.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.392
Dean? Now,

04:27.684 --> 04:30.270
if I see any race gangs forming,

04:30.562 --> 04:31.813
I will have no choice

04:32.105 --> 04:34.441
but to adjust the contrasts
on your screens

04:34.733 --> 04:36.276
until you all look the same.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.653
And we have a very strict.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.407
No Bullying policy
that relates directly to me,

04:42.699 --> 04:44.242
so be nice... to me.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.869
No need to be nervous.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.805
We're all here because
we've done some bad stuff.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.791
But we ain't here to do any more.
Aw.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.210
That's very folksy. Thank you.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.545
So I guess just

04:55.837 --> 04:58.089
roll forth and rehabilitate!

05:01.968 --> 05:03.428
Watch this.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.563 --> 05:15.023
All right, knock it off.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.068
No one at this school should
pick on any class of people.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.696
It's like watching magicians bully
jugglers. What's your name?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.907
- Willy.
- Willy, take a seat.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.038
I'm Mr. Jeff Winger.
I teach Fundamentals of Law.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.916
Does that mean you can teach me
how to get out?

05:33.208 --> 05:35.126
Probably not.
I was a phony lawyer.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.418
I got caught, and now I
teach a pretty phony class.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.755
It's an automatic A.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.132
But you might learn
a thing or two.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.343
And I mean, literally,
a thing or two. Cool?

05:44.469 --> 05:47.389
And they call me the criminal.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.725
Trust me. I know
the main difference between us

05:51.017 --> 05:53.186
is an orange jumpsuit.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.771
And you have an iPad!

05:56.273 --> 05:58.149
Yeah, and I'm a murderer.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.532
Now, now, don't worry.
I ain't proud of it.

06:05.824 --> 06:06.992
Just don't hide it.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.964
You know, once you take
another man's life,

06:08.994 --> 06:10.714
the least you could do
is carry it with you.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.041
Are you carrying any murders,
Mr. Winger?

06:18.420 --> 06:20.380
I am not.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.072
I hear you have to have strong
feelings for someone you kill.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.759
I try to reserve that stuff
for myself.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.266
All right, that's enough law.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.768
Who wants to watch Planet Earth?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.520
Oh, look!

06:35.812 --> 06:37.647
Ice worlds.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.942
Oh, the majesty.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.195
Rhinos and elephants and fiamingos.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.575
Hey, Abed.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.411
Haven't you been in our
apartment longer than Annie?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.705
Oh, yeah. I remember
when she first moved in.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.474
That was back when I was
so worried about pacing,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.578
I was constantly laying
groundwork for pop back gags.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.793
Hey, Annie.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.521
I'd like to make this moment
worth popping back to

07:00.545 --> 07:01.755
from some point in the future.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.715
I don't know what that means.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.345
There. Don't worry.
It'll pay off. Hey, Troy.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.781
I'm glad I kicked that habit. It
was getting a little joyless.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.599
What I'm saying is,
by Annie's logic...

07:12.891 --> 07:14.327
You're saying I was first
in the apartment,

07:14.351 --> 07:16.162
so I could overrule Annie
and let you have a party.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.622
But I don't get anything
out of parties.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.956
They're like conventions
for every subject

07:18.980 --> 07:20.499
too boring to have
their own convention.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.792
And instead of Joss Whedon,
the police show up.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.026
The police also showed up

07:23.318 --> 07:24.712
when you made Leonard
take off his clothes

07:24.736 --> 07:26.088
and filled the living room
with lizards.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.672
That was for my movie,
Reverse Godzilla.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.616
I also thought it might
make a good pop back.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.703
I make movies, Britta.
I make movies.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.413
Annie makes rules.
You make parties.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.141
Her rules cancel out your
parties, but I'm not involved.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.333
I just make movies.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.812
Hey, evening, Mr. Winger.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.233
Willy, you're here late.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.652
Yeah, taking some night classes.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.504
Trying to take full
advantage, you know?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.865
This your car? It's nice.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.535
Looks like you're taking
full advantage too.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.038
Yeah, it's a real dream gig.
Mmm, sarcasm.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.791
Slick words. Cock of the walk.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.960
What are categories
in Prison Jeopardy?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.880
Hey, you mind helping me out
with something?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.612
I think I lost a ball bearing,
and it rolled down them stairs.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.968
Lost a ball bearing?

08:30.260 --> 08:32.136
Mmm-hmm. Down them stairs.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.682
You want me to look down
these stairs? Okay.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.651
Did you just try to murder me?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.033
Are you trying to murder me?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.912
You're trying as hard as you
can right now to kill me.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.253
Okay, well, uh,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.338
I guess I'll see you
in class tomorrow?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.800
Guy who tried to murder me?

09:11.092 --> 09:14.054
Oh, I'll see you in class
tomorrow, Mr. Winger.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.890
I will see you...

09:19.350 --> 09:20.977
Yeah, I'll see you...

09:21.478 --> 09:22.479
Oy vey.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.693
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow,
Mr. Winger.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.077
Um...

09:38.411 --> 09:41.623
so we are having a party?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.750
Annie! You know me
better than that.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.251
This is all set dressing.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.171
I'm helping Abed
produce his next film.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.757
"Britta's Party,."

09:51.049 --> 09:53.802
"Based on a True Story
of Fun and No Rules."

09:54.094 --> 09:55.720
Hmm. "Fade in before a party."

09:56.012 --> 09:57.347
"People start coming over.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.516
"Way more than eight." Mmm.

09:59.808 --> 10:00.809
"It becomes a rager."

10:01.101 --> 10:02.181
"Everyone has a great time"

10:02.435 --> 10:03.955
"and parties like
there's no tomorrow."

10:04.229 --> 10:06.981
"Then they leave.
Sophia cleans up. The end."

10:07.273 --> 10:09.313
We're very interested in you
for the role of Sophia.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.406
I see the real-time stakes
of Can't Hardly Wait,

10:11.444 --> 10:13.004
the subversive raunch
of Risky Business,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.049
and the mumbly pointlessness
of everything after 2003.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.574
Yeah, but real. Totally real.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.886
The first movie to capture the
heart of a real party.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.387
The sensation that
there's no tomorrow.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.971
The transcendence of time
and mortality.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.165
Bravo, Britta. Very clever.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.583
Me?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.315
Don't look at me. I could never
greenlight a project this big.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.463
I moved in third. I'm a coucher.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.840
She's a coucher!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.384
- I sleep...
- On a couch!

10:34.676 --> 10:35.677
Oh, she's a coucher!

10:35.969 --> 10:36.969
Look out! Look out!

10:37.053 --> 10:38.638
Who was it? It's the coucher!

10:38.930 --> 10:40.723
Oh, boy. Okay.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.934
Good night. Good night.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.313
Aw.

10:47.605 --> 10:51.234
Before this is over,
you'll beg for my forgiveness.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.790
So we have
an ultimately low stakes

11:06.082 --> 11:08.877
but nonetheless creepy problem
with one of our wi-felons.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.169
You mean Willy.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.713
Yes. What else did he do?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.525
Did he steal
the driver's ed simulator?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.401
Did he start an illegal game
of solitaire on his face?

11:15.425 --> 11:17.760
Jeffrey, he's in the room.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.137
Hey, Mr. Winger.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.722
Why is he on your laptop?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.849
He came to me for a chat
this morning.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.143
He's here for an education,
Jeffrey,

11:25.435 --> 11:26.895
and he reports to the prison.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.980
Could you do a little more
in your class

11:29.272 --> 11:30.982
than show Planet Earth?

11:31.274 --> 11:33.067
You're telling on me?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.587
He tried to murder me
last night.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.446
What? Now, hold on.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.490
Now, where I'm from,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.102
you accuse somebody of something,
you better have evidence,

11:42.160 --> 11:43.453
or he better be a minority.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.025
He tried to push me down stairs.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.081
That's ridiculous.
It was ridiculous.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.893
But this is not someone who should
be interacting with students.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.878
And you're seriously taking
his word over mine?

11:52.170 --> 11:53.922
Well, have you ever
killed anyone, Jeffrey?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.924
Why would an actual murderer

11:56.216 --> 11:58.676
want to kill
a community college teacher?

11:58.968 --> 12:02.138
Now I'm not worth murdering?
Why would I lie?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.724
Isn't that your specialty?
You're a raconteur.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.518
You charm people with your
slick and fancy words.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.810
Willy...

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
Willy just charms them.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.191
Oh, my God!

12:13.483 --> 12:15.818
I should leave you two alone.
I've got classes.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.403
Some of us came here to work.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.364
Jealousy isn't a crime, Jeffrey,

12:19.656 --> 12:23.243
but costing the school
$300,000 will be.

12:23.534 --> 12:27.205
So be a good teacher, especially
when Willy's watching.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.922
Which is why they call it
"yard juice."

12:36.214 --> 12:38.591
Next question. Do you get
to pick your number?

12:38.883 --> 12:41.052
Does anyone ever get their
head stuck between the bars?

12:41.344 --> 12:42.720
We call it getting metal ears.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.389
Oh, hi, Mr. Winger.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.921
Thought we'd sneak in a little
learning before the movie.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.393
Well, there's no movie today,

12:48.685 --> 12:50.728
so everyone
roll to your seat areas.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.188
Yes, sir.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.107
So...

12:55.233 --> 12:57.777
Law. Law is, simply put,

12:58.069 --> 13:00.154
an agreement we all make
to do our best

13:00.446 --> 13:02.198
to stay out of each other's way.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.909
Is there a more technical
definition, Mr. winger?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.869
Well, I wouldn't know, Willy.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.290
I don't cotton much to fancy
words and book study.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.861
It's not how I got
to where I am.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.419
How did you get to be
where you are, Mr. Winger?

13:14.711 --> 13:15.837
Where were you born?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.797
Mr. Winger was born

13:18.089 --> 13:20.550
in dirt, Willy.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.260
Same as you, I'm sure.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.971
And I had my face
held down in that dirt

13:25.263 --> 13:26.306
by the kings of dirt.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.058
And now, they're still there,

13:29.350 --> 13:31.352
ruling over dirt, and I...

13:32.478 --> 13:33.479
got out.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.149
By talking. By lying.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.526
Well, in case
you hadn't noticed,

13:38.818 --> 13:40.987
it seems to beat being a bully.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.784
Garrett.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.330
Mr. Winger, when did you stop being funny?

13:51.289 --> 13:53.041
I mean, am I wrong,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.418
or does he seem
really intense here?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.338
Like, "Ah, you were born in
the dirt, and you'll die in the dirt."

13:58.629 --> 14:00.549
Kings... and then,
who are the kings of the dirt?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.178
Everyone's so charmed by him

14:05.470 --> 14:07.221
because he's a violent criminal.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.724
But he's also a petty sociopath.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.256
And the more I try to point
that out, the pettier I look.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.520
Weren't you the one who
championed this program?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.052
Shouldn't have worn that petard

14:16.189 --> 14:17.709
if you didn't want to be
hoisted by it.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.360
What do you think the expression

14:20.651 --> 14:22.403
"hoisted by your own petard"
is referencing?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.489
I guess I just assumed
that in the old days,

14:24.781 --> 14:27.825
a petard was a special
outfit, like a leotard,

14:28.117 --> 14:29.994
with a lot of fancy buckles
and loops on it

14:30.286 --> 14:31.686
and that rich people
would wear them

14:31.871 --> 14:33.790
when they were feeling
especially smug,

14:34.082 --> 14:35.166
but then poor people

14:35.458 --> 14:37.043
could tie a rope
to one of the loops

14:37.335 --> 14:38.711
and hoist them up a pole

14:39.003 --> 14:40.338
and then let them dangle there

14:40.630 --> 14:41.923
as punishment for being cocky.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.801
Never look it up. Your
explanation is way better.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.596
But also, the next time a friend
comes by with their problems,

14:48.888 --> 14:51.474
maybe lay off
the I-told-you-so's.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.851
Jeff, we're having
a Britta party here.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.604
Could you be a little
bit less of a buzzkill?

14:59.107 --> 15:00.691
That was great.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.360
Now party like
there's no tomorrow.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.153
What? There's no tomorrow.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.445
Party like it.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.286
Huh... um...

15:15.915 --> 15:19.669
Um, okay. Uh, why don't you just do some
business in the background for now?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.339
Hi, everybody! Ah, don't worry.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.550
We're not here
to bust up your party.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.844
I know most of you are like 30.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.972
We're here because Frankie
Dart has exciting news.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.808
You have all been
very cooperative

15:34.100 --> 15:36.644
with this inmate
education program.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.730
The Department of Corrections
is very, very happy.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.984
Which means Greendale
is gonna be rich.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.320
So don't tell anybody,

15:46.612 --> 15:49.615
but we smuggled in a few guests to
the party to celebrate with us.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.452
Did someone order a prison break?

15:54.036 --> 15:56.247
Plenty of convicts to go around.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.337
Take them to the dance floor!

16:03.963 --> 16:06.382
Cheers. Yeah.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.385
Pass 'em around!
That's willy, pass him!

16:09.677 --> 16:11.471
- Yeah!
- Over here.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.639
Over here. Pass Willy.
Pass me Willy.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.853
Here you go, Willy.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.522
Oh, crap. This is it.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.815
Keep doing that.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.400
Keep doing that.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.359
Whoo-hoo!

16:42.251 --> 16:44.962
Try dancing harder.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.548
Is that as hard
as you can dance?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.842
You're at a party.
You're celebrating!

16:50.134 --> 16:52.845
Abed, it's 6:00 in the morning.
Okay, thanks.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.235
Don't you think you've
gotten enough shots?

16:56.516 --> 16:57.993
Nobody's partied like
there's no tomorrow yet.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.161
They keep dancing
like it's today.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.185
That's okay.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.857
Are you joking?

17:05.148 --> 17:06.667
This is the reason
I signed on to this film.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.877
I think
it's a performance issue.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.737
I think this needed
some real actors.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
Well, lesson learned. Yeah.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.576
Okay, from the top. And action!

17:15.867 --> 17:17.578
What?

17:17.869 --> 17:19.430
- Who are these people?
- Professionals.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.915
Go, go, go!

17:21.207 --> 17:23.459
Good, Dean. Good, Frankie.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.751
Party!

17:24.919 --> 17:27.213
Party! No tomorrow, guys.
Come on.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.135
Hey, Mr. Winger.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.054
You know, I was thinking
for class today,

17:35.346 --> 17:37.682
maybe you could, uh...
hey, hey, what's going on?

17:37.974 --> 17:38.974
Whoa, whoa, hey!

17:39.058 --> 17:40.393
Careful now! Put me down!

17:42.562 --> 17:44.438
Well, Willy,

17:44.730 --> 17:45.731
look at me.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.441
I'm a murderer.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.235
Can I be as cool as you now?

17:49.527 --> 17:51.028
Huh?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.989
Willy?

17:53.281 --> 17:55.241
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

17:55.533 --> 17:57.326
Willy, talk to me!

17:57.618 --> 17:58.911
Talk to me!

17:59.203 --> 18:00.871
I can't see anything.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.291
Willy, focus on my voice.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.042
Hey, I'm losing you.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.752
You're not losing me!

18:07.044 --> 18:10.965
You are going to a better
place with a stronger signal!

18:11.257 --> 18:14.552
W-Willy? Willy?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.470
Willy!

18:16.762 --> 18:18.723
What's going on here?
He started it.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.393
Jeffrey, you are on sabbatical.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.353
You can't do that. Yes, I can!

18:24.645 --> 18:26.397
Two weeks paid sabbatical!

18:26.689 --> 18:27.773
Get him out of here.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.609
He's banned from the campus.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.569
You are on sabbatical!

18:31.861 --> 18:32.945
You're on sabbatical, sir.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.448
Yeah, I'll go on my own,
with dignity.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.991
Something you should look up!

18:37.283 --> 18:39.035
I can't look it up!

18:39.327 --> 18:42.121
You destroyed my device!
And my heart!

18:42.413 --> 18:44.332
You destroyed his device
and his heart, sir.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.042
Yeah, I'm going.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.336
Willy!

18:49.253 --> 18:50.963
Willy!

18:57.178 --> 18:58.220
Sorry I'm late.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.264
I couldn't find
a parking spot for my house.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.184
Oh, it must be so cool
living in a vehicle, man...

19:03.476 --> 19:05.394
Wait, where does your poop go?

19:05.686 --> 19:06.686
A tank.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.814
Gross. Get a house.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.106
Ben, aren't you homeless?

19:10.358 --> 19:11.901
Yeah, but I poop in a house.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.193
Whose?

19:13.277 --> 19:14.695
Nice try.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.323
Annie.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.575
Britta.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.077
How's your movie coming?

19:22.328 --> 19:24.205
Amazing. Abed's a genius.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.617
He's actually having a hard
time deciding what to cut,

19:26.832 --> 19:28.192
so it's going to be
in two volumes.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.059
And it's hard to sleep,
but it's worth it

19:30.294 --> 19:31.712
because it's a movie...

19:32.838 --> 19:34.548
about a party...

19:36.717 --> 19:38.052
Would you like my help?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.720
Yes.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.389
Have you learned anything?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.121
Don't question rules.
Rules are good.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.684
I'm bad. All hail Annie.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.102
Thank you. Damn.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.563
Oh, nice of you to show up.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.273
We moved here for you.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.419
I didn't ask for this. Have your meeting
at school without me. I don't care.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.404
Dean's using the study
room for the ceremony.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.406
- Wh... the ceremony?
- You don't know?

19:58.698 --> 20:01.098
The dean's making that convict
you murdered into a professor.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.910
What? Why do you care?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.347
Because the dean is just doing
this to prove something,

20:05.371 --> 20:06.455
and it's really stupid.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.587
The guy's dangerous,
and he's manipulating him.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.293
Isn't that what you usually do?

20:11.585 --> 20:13.546
No! I mean, yes,
but not like that.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.673
I lie to the dean
for personal gain.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.205
I wouldn't use him emotionally.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.509
I wouldn't mislead him.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.137
I wouldn't hurt him.

20:21.429 --> 20:25.224
Have you ever thought
of saying that to the dean?

20:26.934 --> 20:29.603
Jeff, go to him.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.314
Going to him.

20:32.606 --> 20:36.068
Wait, that's the whole point. I can't
go to him. I can't get on campus.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.154
And yet murderers can.

20:38.446 --> 20:41.157
What have I done? Murderers
can get on campus.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.161
I'll need a broom,
a remote control car,

20:45.453 --> 20:46.704
an iPad and an elaborate,

20:46.996 --> 20:48.956
gyroscopically stabilized
servomotor.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.000
Dude, we're trying
to help Jeff here.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.544
You're acting
kind of spoiled right now.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.213
Party, party, party, party,
party, party, party, party,

20:56.505 --> 20:58.665
party, party, party, party,
party, party, party, party,

20:58.841 --> 21:00.468
party, party, party, party,
party, party.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.760
Cut!

21:03.179 --> 21:04.179
Abed...

21:05.389 --> 21:06.849
Britta has something to say.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.064
My script is misleading.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.776
It's impossible to party
like there's no tomorrow.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.026
But it's based on a true...

21:22.281 --> 21:24.325
It's based on my desire
to have a party.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.952
Parties are just booze,
low lights,

21:27.244 --> 21:30.039
and loud music, so people
can feel more, see less,

21:30.331 --> 21:32.792
and not have to listen
to each other or themselves.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.754
That's stupid.
Parties are stupid.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.842
I'm stupid. You're
shooting a stupid movie.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.554
That's a wrap!

21:45.846 --> 21:47.181
- Aw!
- What?

21:47.473 --> 21:49.099
All right. Go on!
We're done here!

21:51.685 --> 21:53.521
Bye. Bye.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.030
What's gonna happen to me?

22:06.534 --> 22:08.577
You're going to be punished

22:08.869 --> 22:10.955
in ways you won't understand

22:11.247 --> 22:15.042
for longer than you think
is rational or possible.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.710
But then one day,

22:17.002 --> 22:19.713
you'll do something he
likes, and he'll stop.

22:20.005 --> 22:23.843
And eventually you'll either
adapt or lose your mind.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.177
Okay.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.848
Girls?

22:29.598 --> 22:30.683
Girls.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.896
As a prison warden,
I know all too well

22:36.188 --> 22:39.066
how rare stories
of true rehabilitation can be.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.068
But this dean and this prisoner

22:41.360 --> 22:42.360
stand here together today

22:42.570 --> 22:44.029
to prove that the dream is real.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.074
I'm here for the ceremony.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.661
Last name? Geller.
Prisoner ID 042098.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.413
Okay, go on.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.030
Hi, I'm here for the ceremony...

22:58.294 --> 22:59.587
Have a nice night, sir.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.047
Hmm.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.385
Dean Craig Pelton,

23:06.677 --> 23:09.638
do you accept responsibility for any
damage incurred by hiring a felon?

23:10.806 --> 23:11.891
I do.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.392
Willy Seeber Smith,

23:13.684 --> 23:15.394
do you accept that
the 13th amendment

23:15.686 --> 23:17.730
abolished slavery for
everyone but convicts

23:18.022 --> 23:19.622
and that we have no choice
but to pay you

23:19.815 --> 23:21.317
13 per hour or less?

23:21.609 --> 23:23.277
I do. Aw.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.571
Then let us make official
this symbolic union...

23:25.863 --> 23:27.114
Hold it!

23:27.406 --> 23:30.075
Dean, I agree there's no reason

23:30.367 --> 23:32.077
you shouldn't give
this guy my job.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.347
Save it, Jeffrey! I don't want to hear it!
But don't do it

23:34.371 --> 23:37.625
before I tell you some things that I've
been getting away with not saying.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.252
Somebody get this maniac out of here.
Quiet, Willy.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.546
Let's do this by prison rules.

23:42.838 --> 23:43.838
Say what you have to say.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.759
Dean, I like my job.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.219
I don't mind
coming to work here.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.598
I feel kind of guilty
when I pretend to be sick,

23:52.890 --> 23:54.642
and I try to steal
as little as possible.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.268
Just the basics.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.854
Pens, coffee filters,
toilet paper,

23:59.146 --> 24:00.481
and one time,

24:00.773 --> 24:03.275
an overhead projector
and a roll of carpet.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.987
But I don't lead you on,
and I never will

24:07.279 --> 24:09.907
because I'm not just a pretty
face that murders people

24:10.199 --> 24:12.117
and tells you
what you want to hear.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.036
I'm less than that.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.330
I'm a gorgeous face

24:16.622 --> 24:19.667
that works for you
and considers you a friend.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.210
Aw. Oh, Jeffrey.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.170
Now, to be fair,

24:23.462 --> 24:25.222
you guys know Willy's
an innocent man, right?

24:25.506 --> 24:26.757
You shut your mouth, Warden!

24:27.049 --> 24:28.634
No, it's true.
His appeal is in motion.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.178
There's new DNA evidence.
He's a good fella.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.055
Wrongfully convicted.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.724
You're... not a murderer?

24:36.016 --> 24:37.726
I can explain.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.229
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.022
You son of a bitch!

24:44.441 --> 24:47.653
Wait, let's do this
by community college rules.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.363
Fight! Fight! Fight!

24:56.870 --> 24:59.206
Ha ha!

24:59.498 --> 25:01.375
Go, brooms, go!

25:01.667 --> 25:04.003
Bring it on.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.294
It's so violent.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.672
You punch like a girl!

25:06.964 --> 25:08.173
Oh!

25:08.465 --> 25:10.300
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.636
Is this what you want?
Here's what I got.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.139
Come on! Let's do it!

25:18.642 --> 25:19.643
Oh! Jeffrey!

25:21.770 --> 25:22.896
Now who's fallen?

25:23.188 --> 25:24.188
Hey, Willy?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa...

25:33.615 --> 25:34.615
Thanks, Dean.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.787
Dean. Dean!

25:39.079 --> 25:40.706
Oh, come on.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.291
No, no.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.168
No! Stop.

25:45.127 --> 25:48.464
Way to go, Mr. winger.
Way to go.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.633
Everybody, I am not
participating in this.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.678
What the hell kind of school
is this?

25:57.765 --> 25:59.892
Okay, thanks for coming
on short notice.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.435
Uh, is everyone here?

26:01.727 --> 26:02.728
I think so.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.855
It's hard to tell
without side cameras.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.316
Wait, why am I moving?

26:07.608 --> 26:09.193
Is my custom background working?

26:09.485 --> 26:10.944
Wait, I can't...

26:11.236 --> 26:13.590
It's w-A-S-D to move. It's been the same
since the invention of the keyboard.

26:13.614 --> 26:14.615
Okay, nerd.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.743
As you've heard,
the rehabilitation program

26:18.035 --> 26:20.829
has been aborted,
so we lost that money.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.332
But we no longer
have to build 67 ramps,

26:23.624 --> 26:24.708
so we should break even.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.710
Can you all hear that?

26:27.002 --> 26:29.880
There's a kid outside throwing
tennis balls against my RV!

26:30.172 --> 26:31.840
I think
I'm fr... en... you're...

26:32.132 --> 26:34.551
coffee sho...
corporate thieves... I...

26:34.843 --> 26:37.971
was it really necessary for us to
use these things for this meeting?

26:38.263 --> 26:40.116
Yeah, I think there's
something wrong with mine.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.300
I'll get a better connection.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.228
It wasn't entirely necessary,

26:44.520 --> 26:46.939
but the prison is selling
these units at a discount,

26:47.231 --> 26:49.274
so I thought I'd run their
offer by the school.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.901
What are you doing? Get out!

26:51.193 --> 26:52.193
Mine's broken.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.505
No, it's not. Bad connect...

26:53.529 --> 26:54.849
There's a janitor on it
right now.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.949
C... other... go...

26:57.241 --> 26:58.784
I think Britta's being arrested.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.537
I have every right to be here.
You think...

27:01.829 --> 27:02.909
Scared of you, but I'm not!

27:03.163 --> 27:04.915
All right, that's it!

27:05.207 --> 27:07.251
Do you know how much windows
cost, John McEnroe?

27:07.543 --> 27:09.419
Get off my lap.
Stop fighting technology!

27:09.711 --> 27:11.511
I vote yes. We should get these.
They're cool.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.078
I vote no. People shouldn't
have to be everywhere at once.

27:14.258 --> 27:15.738
Sometimes we need
to do our own thing.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.553
Chang, where are you?

27:18.720 --> 27:19.721
I'm doing my own thing.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.557
Why is there tile behind you?

27:21.849 --> 27:23.559
Please tell me you're
not doing the thing

27:23.851 --> 27:25.185
I think you're doing. Ew.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.413
That's the same tile we have
in our apartment's bathroom.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.730
What? Chang!

27:29.022 --> 27:30.022
I gotta go!

27:30.190 --> 27:31.942
Oh, my God.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.736
Yeah, I gotta go too.
Oh, Jeffrey!

27:35.028 --> 27:36.548
I take it we're passing
on their offer.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.616
No, they're just amateurs.
Initiating override protocol.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.578
All in favor of this purchase?

27:42.870 --> 27:44.788
Affirmative. Very well.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.041
Abeds, commence with world domination.
Eradicate.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.003
Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate!

27:51.295 --> 27:53.088
Eradicate! Eradicate! Eradicate!

27:53.380 --> 27:57.217
Eradicate. Eradicate. Eradicate.
