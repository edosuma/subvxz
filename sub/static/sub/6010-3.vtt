01:02.925 --> 01:05.330
Oh. Hello, Edith, dear.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.690
Hello, Granny. Isn't it exciting?

01:07.725 --> 01:10.605
At my age one must ration
one's excitement.

01:12.805 --> 01:17.205
I told her everything would come
right but she wouldn't believe me.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.130
I still can't.

01:19.165 --> 01:22.045
Something happening in this house is
actually about me.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.730
The dress came this morning.

01:23.765 --> 01:28.353
I was sad you decided against Pat,
too. I would've paid.

01:28.388 --> 01:31.605
Lucille was safer. We don't want her
to look like a chorus girl.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.010
- How's Anthony? Excited, I hope.
- Desperately.

01:35.045 --> 01:37.570
Just when he thought his life
would never change,

01:37.605 --> 01:42.005
- he's going back to the beginning.
- What an invigorating prospect!

01:42.565 --> 01:46.050
I hope you've got
your shirt ready for tonight.

01:46.085 --> 01:50.010
In case you're interested, I've hidden a
couple so I won't be caught out that way again.

01:50.045 --> 01:52.831
- Why should I be interested?
- That goes for you, too.

01:52.850 --> 01:55.770
- Me?
- Take no notice.

01:55.805 --> 01:59.010
Anna, are the flowers done?

01:59.045 --> 02:02.865
Yes, I'll check them on Saturday
and lose any that's going over.

02:02.900 --> 02:06.685
I've kept back a few in bud. I'll be
home for the dressing gong.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.570
We'll manage.

02:08.604 --> 02:10.685
Still no word from the doctor?

02:11.885 --> 02:14.210
I'd have told you if there was.

02:14.245 --> 02:18.525
They don't mind stringing it out.
Shall we got and see him?

02:18.560 --> 02:22.445
Why? I'm sure if he knew anything
he would've said.

02:23.565 --> 02:25.645
How are you today, Mr Molesley?

02:28.645 --> 02:30.530
Very well, thank you.

02:30.565 --> 02:34.605
You were talking the other night
about your friend's daughter.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.850
- Is she still looking for a place?
- She is.

02:36.885 --> 02:40.730
You read about the servant shortage
in the newspapers

02:40.765 --> 02:44.805
but you can't find a situation
for a lady's maid. Not one.

02:45.355 --> 02:47.556
She'll end up as a house maid
if she's not careful.

02:47.787 --> 02:52.165
We can't have that. If I were
to tell you something,

02:52.200 --> 02:55.022
promise not to breathe
a word downstairs.

02:55.057 --> 02:57.845
Miss O'Brien doesn't want
anyone to know.

03:04.325 --> 03:06.485
How will they advertise it?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.485
I don't know exactly.

03:09.605 --> 03:11.730
Desirable nobleman's mansion

03:11.765 --> 03:14.090
with surrounding estate
and properties.

03:14.125 --> 03:18.285
- Where will you go?
- We have land on the border with Durham.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.290
It came with my great grandmother.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.678
The house is pretty,
we might make something of it.

03:22.959 --> 03:26.965
- We could rename it Downton Place.
- Who lives there now?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.410
A tenant but we can come
to an arrangement.

03:29.445 --> 03:33.645
Let's take a picnic there tomorrow
on Edith's last day of freedom.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.970
Molesley's in the hall. He wonders
if you mind have a word?

03:37.005 --> 03:40.485
- I'll come through in a minute.
- Not with you, with Mama.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.725
Molesley.

03:46.845 --> 03:49.325
Your Ladyship, may I have a word?

03:49.360 --> 03:51.045
Of course.

03:52.245 --> 03:56.645
My Lady, might I be allowed
to put forward a candidate

03:56.680 --> 03:59.450
- as Miss O'Brien's replacement?
- What?

03:59.485 --> 04:02.805
- When the time comes.
- Is O'Brien leaving?

04:03.845 --> 04:06.410
I hope I've not spoken out of turn,

04:06.445 --> 04:10.205
only I didn't want to miss
the chance. I thought you knew.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.645
Of course I know, thank you.
I'll be happy to listen

04:13.680 --> 04:16.445
to recommendations
when, as you say, the time comes.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.765
Thank you, My Lady.

04:21.365 --> 04:25.450
Well, I must confess, I'll watch her
departure with mixed emotions.

04:25.485 --> 04:28.593
- Mine are fairly unmixed.
- Did you have a clue?

04:28.529 --> 04:30.526
Not a clue.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.850
How very disappointing.

04:31.885 --> 04:36.245
But in a way it raises the big question
when do we tell the staff

04:36.280 --> 04:38.685
- that the end is nigh?
- It sounds so final.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.970
I'm afraid it is final.

04:41.005 --> 04:43.050
Well, don't spoil Edith's stay.

04:43.085 --> 04:47.205
Let's get through the wedding first
then tell them afterwards.

04:49.485 --> 04:52.045
Oh, Dr Clarkson.

04:53.445 --> 04:56.505
- Do you have a minute?
- Er, one minute, yes.

04:56.540 --> 04:59.565
- Do you mind if we...
- Only I know Mrs Hughes

04:59.600 --> 05:01.690
is suffering from a condition

05:01.725 --> 05:05.245
and I wondered if there's anything
I can do to help?

05:05.280 --> 05:08.090
You can help
by lessening her duties.

05:08.125 --> 05:12.085
- But you can't tell me how serious it is?
- I'm afraid not.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.405
Even if I knew, which I don't...

05:14.440 --> 05:16.130
yet.

05:16.165 --> 05:18.165
Good day to you, Mr Carson.

05:19.845 --> 05:23.445
I had a telephone call
from Charkham earlier.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.330
- Charkham?
- Reggie Swire's lawyer.

05:26.365 --> 05:28.850
It seems the death certificate
has arrived from India.

05:28.885 --> 05:32.103
- He wants to bring it here.
- Why can't he send it?

05:32.053 --> 05:34.046
He wants to bring it.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.050
He was quite definite.

05:35.085 --> 05:39.005
I told him to come tomorrow.
There's nothing going on, is there?

05:39.040 --> 05:42.002
You know there is,
we're taking a picnic

05:42.037 --> 05:44.930
to see the house
we have to move into.

05:44.965 --> 05:48.705
I'm surprised you, of all people,
can forget that.

05:48.740 --> 05:52.445
He's coming in the morning,
I won't put him off.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.605
This is the moment when you receive a
huge fortune that could save Downton

05:56.640 --> 05:58.645
and you give it away?

05:59.845 --> 06:03.570
- Will you choose where to give it?
- How can I? I'd give it to Papa!

06:03.605 --> 06:07.057
I hope in some small part of you you
can understand.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.486
I'm trying, really I am.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.365
But I can't pretend
I'm doing very well.

06:15.645 --> 06:18.165
Will there be anything more,
My Lady?

06:18.200 --> 06:19.885
No.

06:21.845 --> 06:24.885
Unless you have something
you want to tell me.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.930
What might that be, My Lady?

06:26.965 --> 06:31.445
I won't prompt you, O'Brien,
if you're not ready to say.

06:38.845 --> 06:41.405
- Did she tell you why?
- No.

06:44.045 --> 06:46.010
Maybe she doesn't want until she settles

06:46.045 --> 06:49.130
where she's going
but she has let me down.

06:49.165 --> 06:53.805
We should go. Strallan won't be late.
He never is, worse luck.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.130
I know you're not happy,

06:56.165 --> 06:58.450
but Edith will be
in the same county.

06:58.485 --> 07:02.485
Loxley's a nice house, the estate
will give her plenty to do.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.542
She'll be a nurse
and by the time she's 50

07:05.577 --> 07:08.565
she'll be wheeling round
a one-arm OLD man.

07:11.085 --> 07:14.139
Are you waiting down here 'til they come
in search of the pudding?

07:14.089 --> 07:15.135
No, Mrs Patmore.

07:20.765 --> 07:24.965
- Can I do something for you?
- I'd better get back upstairs,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.525
but, um, while you're here,

07:29.205 --> 07:31.325
I saw Dr Clarkson today.

07:33.845 --> 07:36.365
I'm worried about Mrs Hughes.

07:37.085 --> 07:39.050
We're all worried,

07:39.085 --> 07:41.490
but I don't think
he should've told you.

07:41.525 --> 07:45.170
He said it would help
if we lessened her workload.

07:45.205 --> 07:49.925
I'm sure it would but she won't be
pleased he's talked about her

07:49.960 --> 07:51.925
before it's been confirmed.

07:53.365 --> 07:57.450
- So it is cancer?
- Not until it's confirmed.

07:57.485 --> 08:01.485
Don't say anything. She'd hate
to think the doctor told you.

08:02.605 --> 08:04.845
He didn't tell me, Mrs Patmore,

08:06.205 --> 08:08.205
you told me.

08:13.619 --> 08:18.859
Lady Edith... Edith tells me you're
very interested in politics.

08:18.894 --> 08:21.036
Tom is our tame revolutionary.

08:21.071 --> 08:23.105
Every family should have one.

08:23.140 --> 08:25.104
As long as you are tame.

08:25.139 --> 08:27.619
Tame enough for a game of billiards.

08:27.654 --> 08:29.579
What about it?

08:32.019 --> 08:34.419
Can you tell them where we've gone?

08:41.499 --> 08:45.219
We're getting used to Tom
and I hope you will, too.

08:46.299 --> 08:50.024
We haven't spoken, really,
since it was all settled.

08:50.059 --> 08:53.899
I want you to know I quite
understand why you were against it.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.184
Yes. Well...

08:56.219 --> 08:59.320
I hope you believe I'll do
my best to make her happy.

08:59.256 --> 09:00.478
I do believe that.

09:00.654 --> 09:03.144
- It was never personal.
- No, of course not.

09:03.179 --> 09:07.239
No, it's just because of all this
and I'm far too old.

09:07.274 --> 09:11.299
The thing is done, there's no point
raking it over.

09:11.334 --> 09:14.144
But are you happy about it?

09:14.179 --> 09:18.419
I'm happy Edith is happy, I'm happy
you mean to keep her happy.

09:18.454 --> 09:21.099
That's enough happiness
to be going on with.

09:23.699 --> 09:26.846
There's been a last-minute change
of mind about the wedding menus.

09:26.878 --> 09:30.772
- Couldn't Mrs Patmore do it?
- She's given me her new order list.

09:30.796 --> 09:34.099
She's done her job,
it's time for me to do mine.

09:34.134 --> 09:36.339
I don't want you to get tired.

09:36.739 --> 09:38.859
Who have you been speaking to?

09:39.299 --> 09:42.064
No-one. What do you mean?

09:42.099 --> 09:46.219
Nothing. I don't mean a thing.
Now, let me get on.

09:48.859 --> 09:53.859
This is a simple stitch but strong
and very useful in a drama.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.864
When do we get summat to eat?

09:55.899 --> 09:58.664
As I was saying, you should start it

09:58.699 --> 10:01.939
about half an inch away
from the centre line.

10:03.819 --> 10:06.019
Oh, I'm glad you've come back.

10:06.819 --> 10:09.259
I do hope you've come for our help.

10:09.294 --> 10:11.664
You'd be so welcome if you have.

10:11.699 --> 10:14.699
You wouldn't say that
if you knew what I am.

10:14.734 --> 10:17.184
- I'm past help.
- Nobody's past help.

10:17.219 --> 10:20.984
If you mean you're a prostitute,
you should know

10:21.019 --> 10:25.224
it is true of every woman who has
come here to rebuild their lives.

10:25.259 --> 10:28.746
I'm helping them and I hope I can
help you, too.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.298
That's right.

10:29.488 --> 10:32.486
Why not come in and help us
rebuild our lives?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.459
That's not why I'm here.

10:36.579 --> 10:39.219
That is, I am a... what you said

10:40.059 --> 10:44.219
but I don't want help,
not for myself,

10:44.254 --> 10:46.904
but...

10:46.939 --> 10:50.624
When I make up my mind...
I'm sorry, this has been a mistake.

10:50.659 --> 10:54.299
Please, please, don't go, not again.

10:59.219 --> 11:01.099
It's very strange.

11:01.739 --> 11:03.784
We're leaving.

11:03.819 --> 11:06.664
I'm sorry, Mr Charkham,
to snatch him away.

11:06.699 --> 11:11.579
That's quite all right, Lady Mary.
There will be papers to sign.

11:11.614 --> 11:13.579
Yes, I expect there will.

11:20.259 --> 11:22.739
Papa's asked Anthony
to meet us there

11:22.774 --> 11:25.219
so we can all
face the future together.

11:25.254 --> 11:27.464
He's bringing Isobel and Granny.

11:27.499 --> 11:31.579
- It's hard for your grandmother.
- It's torture for all of us,

11:31.614 --> 11:35.659
and if I ever look like I'm finding
it easy to lose my home

11:35.694 --> 11:37.819
then I am putting on act.

11:44.699 --> 11:47.499
- Are you sure you can manage this?
- Quite sure.

11:47.534 --> 11:50.264
It's nothing hot.
It's not a shooting lunch.

11:50.299 --> 11:54.379
Give them Champagne. That'll allow
you time to set it out properly.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.384
I'll manage. What's this place
we're visiting?

11:57.419 --> 12:01.059
One of His Lordship's houses. I
wonder why they're going there today.

12:01.094 --> 12:03.834
Maybe he likes
to keep a check on things.

12:03.725 --> 12:04.676
Maybe.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.939
- See you there.
- Off you go.

12:07.539 --> 12:10.419
She was a cousin of Granny's.

12:10.699 --> 12:12.984
- Do you want to come with us?
- Yes.

12:13.019 --> 12:15.264
- Thank you.
- Might I have a word, My Lady?

12:15.299 --> 12:19.339
- Of course. What is it?
- This is a slightly awkward request,

12:19.374 --> 12:22.019
- what with the wedding tomorrow...
- Tell me.

12:22.054 --> 12:25.624
Mrs Hughes is very tired.

12:25.659 --> 12:29.699
I wonder if it might be possible for you
to divert some of her work my way?

12:29.734 --> 12:32.419
I don't understand.
What do you mean tired?

12:32.454 --> 12:34.216
Cora...

12:34.251 --> 12:35.944
Carson?

12:35.979 --> 12:38.719
The fact is Mrs Hughes is ill,

12:38.754 --> 12:41.459
My Lady. She may be very ill.

12:42.299 --> 12:44.944
I'm extremely sorry
to trouble you with this

12:44.979 --> 12:48.539
at such a moment, but I don't want
the wedding to sink her.

12:48.574 --> 12:51.256
Of course not,
but how will we manage

12:51.291 --> 12:53.904
without O'Brien
and now Mrs Hughes?

12:53.939 --> 12:57.755
- Miss O'Brien?
- She told Molesley...

12:57.543 --> 12:59.500
Cora, please.

12:59.459 --> 13:01.139
I'm coming.

13:30.419 --> 13:32.139
Mrs Bartlett?

13:33.379 --> 13:35.379
I've brought the money.

13:43.699 --> 13:46.259
It's your loss
cos I've got nothing to say.

13:48.139 --> 13:50.584
All I want to know is if Vera ever...

13:50.619 --> 13:54.499
Oh. So you were on Christian name
terms, were you?

13:55.579 --> 13:57.459
You do surprise me.

13:58.379 --> 14:04.099
If Mrs Bates ever suggested
she was depressed or unhappy...

14:04.134 --> 14:06.104
Of course she was unhappy.

14:06.139 --> 14:10.099
Her husband had left her
and gone off with a trollop.

14:12.739 --> 14:17.379
He'd changed, you know. She was
scared of him by the end.

14:17.414 --> 14:19.459
And now we know she had good reason.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.819
When did you last see her?

14:24.939 --> 14:26.939
You'd better come inside.

14:36.419 --> 14:38.139
Bates.

14:38.659 --> 14:40.379
Watch out.

14:42.019 --> 14:45.499
- What do you mean?
- Search your room, search your bed.

14:45.534 --> 14:48.579
They've set you up,
your cellmate and his mates.

14:48.614 --> 14:50.499
Stop talking!

14:51.899 --> 14:53.819
Just do it.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.184
Her door was open so I looked in.

14:59.219 --> 15:03.019
She was cooking,
but she had to post a letter

15:03.054 --> 15:05.024
so we walked me down the street.

15:05.059 --> 15:09.019
She said Bates was
coming back later for his tea.

15:09.054 --> 15:11.104
She was terrified.

15:11.139 --> 15:13.859
She was in a strange mood,

15:13.894 --> 15:16.056
jumpy, fearful,

15:16.091 --> 15:18.219
but determined.

15:19.219 --> 15:22.139
She'd made pastry,
she scrubbed it out of her nails

15:22.174 --> 15:24.699
like she didn't care
if she took the skin off.

15:24.979 --> 15:28.739
So after she posted the letter
she went home on her own?

15:30.019 --> 15:34.419
She did, poor soul,
and I never saw her after.

15:35.939 --> 15:39.719
I can remember her now
walking away down the street.

15:39.754 --> 15:43.606
It was raining. No, not raining,
more like drizzle.

15:43.641 --> 15:47.459
The gaslight seemed to catch
a sort of halo around her.

15:47.494 --> 15:50.116
A halo? Really?

15:50.151 --> 15:52.704
You can laugh.

15:52.739 --> 15:54.859
When did you hear she was dead?

15:54.894 --> 15:56.579
Next day.

15:57.179 --> 15:59.384
Somehow, I knew it was Bates.

15:59.419 --> 16:02.499
When I heard the verdict,
I thought he'd swing.

16:03.619 --> 16:06.979
He should've if the country
hadn't gone soft.

16:11.539 --> 16:15.064
- This is very good of you.
- Nonsense, we were on the way.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.339
- I wish you'd let me sit in the front.
- I prefer it, I've ridden

16:19.374 --> 16:22.944
- in the front seat many times.
- Aren't you a wild thing!

16:22.979 --> 16:25.905
There's never been a safer
method of travel.

16:26.163 --> 16:27.865
Nor a faster one.

16:27.900 --> 16:31.704
Edith's the speed fiend, she likes
to go at a terrific lick.

16:31.739 --> 16:34.017
Do you think you'll be able
to keep up with her?

16:33.863 --> 16:35.055
I'll try.

16:34.967 --> 16:39.064
What's this place like?
Do you know it?

16:39.099 --> 16:42.584
A little. My late husband
kept the shooting there.

16:42.619 --> 16:44.251
We'd sometimes have luncheon
in the house.

16:44.286 --> 16:45.693
Is it nice?

16:46.414 --> 16:49.224
Nice enough, as a retreat
from the world.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.699
I wouldn't have thought
it suited to much else.

17:01.259 --> 17:03.059
Downton Place.

17:04.939 --> 17:06.659
How lovely.

17:10.378 --> 17:12.199
Won't it be a bit cramped?

17:12.134 --> 17:16.420
You do realize that for most
people it looks like a fairy palace.

17:15.454 --> 17:19.064
We'll be able to run it
with a much smaller staff.

17:19.098 --> 17:22.539
This is it. We won't need
more than eight servants, tops.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.138
So it'll be very economical. It...

17:28.299 --> 17:30.504
What about me? Where am I to go?

17:30.539 --> 17:35.299
- We still own most of the village.
- Oh. Perhaps I could open a shop?

17:35.334 --> 17:38.704
Good idea, Granny.
What do you think it needs?

17:38.739 --> 17:43.339
If it's like everywhere else, good
manners and decent conversation.

17:43.374 --> 17:46.619
Then you should have
a roaring trade in minutes.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.304
- How's everything going?
- Very well.

17:50.339 --> 17:53.379
It's unfair Mary had
an archbishop to marry her

17:53.414 --> 17:55.704
and you've got poor old Mr Travis.

17:55.739 --> 17:59.104
I don't mind, it's such short
notice, he was booked up.

17:59.139 --> 18:03.619
I prefer it, really, to have
the man who christened us.

18:04.499 --> 18:06.499
What did Charkham come for?

18:07.619 --> 18:09.939
He gave me a letter from Swire.

18:10.699 --> 18:14.059
He left one for each of
the three potential heirs

18:14.094 --> 18:16.144
when and if they inherited.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.899
Mine is the only one
to have been delivered.

18:18.934 --> 18:20.784
What did it say?

18:20.819 --> 18:22.779
I haven't opened it.

18:23.819 --> 18:25.944
I can't decide whether I will.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.335
Why wouldn't you?

18:27.365 --> 18:31.020
Because I know
it'll be a paean of praise,

18:30.054 --> 18:34.504
how Lavinia could not have
found a better man, etc.

18:34.539 --> 18:38.579
- And you don't want to read that?
- She could not have found a worse one.

18:38.614 --> 18:41.195
No, I don't. I feel bad enough
and if I read his words

18:41.175 --> 18:44.139
they will stay with me forever.

18:56.099 --> 19:00.059
- Mrs Crawley?
- We're back from our delicious luncheon

19:00.094 --> 19:02.784
and I was on my way home.

19:02.819 --> 19:06.104
You had a maid at Downton,
Ethel Parks.

19:06.139 --> 19:09.839
I was here when she brought her son
into the dining room.

19:09.874 --> 19:13.539
- Who could forget that?
- Do you have an address for her?

19:13.574 --> 19:16.059
I do, if she's still there.

19:16.094 --> 19:17.899
You see...

19:19.779 --> 19:22.184
You see, I saw her this morning

19:22.219 --> 19:24.739
and I'm afraid she's fallen
into a bad way.

19:25.579 --> 19:27.699
- A very bad way.
- Oh, dear.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.744
I am sorry to hear that.

19:29.779 --> 19:32.622
If you'd like to come with me,
I'll fetch it for you.

19:32.726 --> 19:33.968
Thank you.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.819
Get up, both of you!
Against the wall!

20:02.854 --> 20:04.819
Mr Turner, search the bunk, please.

20:13.459 --> 20:15.819
- Nothing here.
- What?

20:28.139 --> 20:30.139
Clean this mess up!

20:38.299 --> 20:40.019
Bastards!

20:44.259 --> 20:46.259
There's a lot of bastards in here.

20:53.299 --> 20:56.344
I expect you're tired.

20:56.379 --> 20:58.819
It's a long day up to London
and back.

20:58.854 --> 21:01.064
Worth the journey? Not really.

21:01.099 --> 21:05.339
Miss O'Brien, might I ask what
you've confided in Mr Molesley

21:05.374 --> 21:09.496
but have kept from the rest of us?
I don't know what you mean.

21:09.531 --> 21:13.091
Mr Molesley has given Her Ladyship
the impression you're planning

21:13.244 --> 21:16.219
- a change of some sort.
- What's this?

21:18.019 --> 21:21.459
I'm sorry, I thought
Her Ladyship would know.

21:21.494 --> 21:23.424
Know what?

21:23.459 --> 21:25.499
That you're leaving.

21:26.739 --> 21:29.139
I beg your pardon?

21:29.819 --> 21:32.539
How dare you make
such an assumption!

21:34.339 --> 21:37.784
Isn't it time for the dressing gong,
Mr Carson?

21:37.819 --> 21:40.226
- It certainly is.
- But...

21:40.462 --> 21:42.710
Excuse me, Mr Molesley,
I've got work to do,

21:42.745 --> 21:44.219
even if you haven't.

21:45.979 --> 21:47.979
I'll deal with you later.

21:49.179 --> 21:53.219
You're in the soup. I wouldn't be
in her bad books for a gold clock.

21:58.298 --> 22:01.703
You must've said something
Molesley misinterpreted.

22:01.738 --> 22:06.858
I say nothing to him beyond "Pass
the salt" and "Out of the way".

22:06.893 --> 22:08.903
There must have been something.

22:08.938 --> 22:12.383
I do feel let down, and right
on top of the wedding...

22:12.418 --> 22:16.138
- You sent for me, My Lady.
- Yes.

22:17.058 --> 22:19.058
Thank you, O'Brien.

22:23.738 --> 22:26.498
Mrs Hughes, I understand
that you're not well.

22:27.818 --> 22:33.178
Whom do you understand that from?
Because if the doctor...

22:33.213 --> 22:35.178
It wasn't Doctor Clarkson.

22:35.898 --> 22:38.978
It is not confirmed that I am ill,
Your Ladyship.

22:39.658 --> 22:43.538
I've had a test and
I'm waiting for the results,

22:43.573 --> 22:45.543
but I am perfectly capable...

22:45.578 --> 22:48.303
Mrs Hughes, I only want
to say one thing,

22:48.338 --> 22:52.383
that if you are ill you are welcome
here for as long as you want.

22:52.418 --> 22:57.258
- Lady Sybil will help us to find a suitable nurse.
- I see.

22:57.293 --> 23:01.415
I don't want you to have concerns
about where you'll go

23:01.450 --> 23:05.538
or who'll look after you.
The answer is here and we will.

23:08.618 --> 23:10.783
I don't know what to say, My Lady.

23:10.818 --> 23:15.658
There's isn't anything more to say
until we know where we stand.

23:15.693 --> 23:17.338
Thank you.

23:19.938 --> 23:22.583
He thinks I don't know
but, of course, I do.

23:22.618 --> 23:27.098
We'll spend two weeks in Rome,
then Florence, then Venice,

23:27.133 --> 23:29.103
so I couldn't be happier.

23:29.138 --> 23:32.326
What about Loxley? Is there masses
to be done?

23:32.088 --> 23:33.546
It's not too bad.

23:33.581 --> 23:36.383
It's not too bad downstairs.
The bedrooms are killers.

23:36.418 --> 23:40.778
Don't do anything too fast, it takes
time to know how a house works.

23:41.418 --> 23:46.058
You really should go to bed.
No bride wants to look tired.

23:46.093 --> 23:50.058
It either means she's anxious
or been up to no good.

23:50.093 --> 23:53.058
- I won't sleep a wink.
- Tonight or tomorrow?

23:53.658 --> 23:57.058
Sybil, vulgarity
is no substitute for wit.

23:57.093 --> 23:58.778
You started it.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.343
Miss O'Brien?

24:03.378 --> 24:06.618
Please understand
I didn't mean any harm.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.743
Why make it up in the first place?

24:08.778 --> 24:11.303
- I didn't make it up, I was told.
- Who told you?

24:11.338 --> 24:15.338
Mr Barrow mentioned it, but I think
it was an honest mistake.

24:15.373 --> 24:19.263
No, it wasn't honest
and it wasn't a mistake,

24:19.298 --> 24:23.058
but don't worry about it,
I can tell it wasn't your fault,

24:23.093 --> 24:25.098
so we'll forget about it, shall we?

24:25.133 --> 24:28.023
And when you see Mr Barrow,

24:28.058 --> 24:32.578
you can tell him I may make
some honest mistakes myself.

24:32.613 --> 24:35.538
- No doubt we'll find out.
- Probably the hard way.

24:45.858 --> 24:48.703
- Why not eat with us?
- Oh, I couldn't do that.

24:48.738 --> 24:52.378
Daisy won't sit down,
the invitation is not in your gift.

24:52.413 --> 24:55.258
She eats with Mrs Patmore
in the kitchen.

24:55.293 --> 24:57.418
Fancy a game of something later?

24:58.338 --> 25:00.503
Daisy's busy.

25:00.538 --> 25:04.338
- Anna?
- I want to write a letter. Sorry.

25:04.373 --> 25:07.218
- I'll play.
- Let's see how we feel.

25:10.058 --> 25:12.223
What do you mean you've read it?

25:12.258 --> 25:16.298
I didn't think it was right to destroy a man's
last words without reading them.

25:16.333 --> 25:19.338
- It wasn't your decision.
- I made it my decision.

25:19.373 --> 25:22.023
- Do you want to hear what he says?
- No.

25:22.058 --> 25:25.183
Lavinia must have written
to him on her last day

25:25.218 --> 25:28.658
- hours before she died.
- Nonsense. No letter was in her room.

25:28.693 --> 25:34.100
She wrote to him after she tried to persuade you
to call off the wedding and you wouldn't.

25:34.135 --> 25:35.778
This is quite impossible.

25:38.978 --> 25:43.298
"She loved and admired you for
the sacrifice of your happiness.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.303
She commended you to my care. "

25:45.338 --> 25:48.183
- I can't listen to any more of this.
- You must.

25:48.218 --> 25:52.298
"I have few intimates so have added
you to my list of heirs.

25:52.333 --> 25:56.911
It's unlikely
I'll outlive the first two

25:57.065 --> 25:58.538
so there's little chance
of you reading this.

25:58.573 --> 26:01.263
If you do and the money
has come to you,

26:01.298 --> 26:04.303
know it is with my full knowledge
of what transpired.

26:04.338 --> 26:11.039
Do not allow grief, guilt or regret
to hold you back in its employment.

26:11.412 --> 26:13.258
God bless you, my boy. Reggie. "

26:23.257 --> 26:26.697
- Are you sure you didn't write it?
- I assume you know his hand.

26:26.775 --> 26:27.698
Not well enough to test a fortune in it.

26:31.928 --> 26:35.938
I'm not accusing you of faking it,

26:37.778 --> 26:39.738
but I suspect someone has.

26:39.773 --> 26:41.698
So it won't change your mind?

26:41.733 --> 26:43.818
Not yet it won't.

26:55.498 --> 26:58.618
Time you were in bed.
It's a big day tomorrow.

26:58.653 --> 27:00.903
I'll just finish this.

27:00.938 --> 27:03.418
Is there something
I can do for you?

27:04.578 --> 27:06.298
No.

27:08.858 --> 27:13.498
Did you say anything about me
to Her Ladyship?

27:13.898 --> 27:16.698
I don't know what you mean. Why?

27:16.818 --> 27:20.058
Don't worry.
She was very kind and...

27:20.093 --> 27:21.863
I was touched.

27:21.898 --> 27:24.938
As you know,
I don't worship them all,

27:24.973 --> 27:27.978
- like you do.
- I wouldn't put it like that.

27:28.013 --> 27:31.378
But this time, I freely admit it

27:32.218 --> 27:34.218
I was quite touched.

27:54.258 --> 27:59.703
Am I interrupting? No, please, I
just want to ask you all something.

27:59.738 --> 28:03.938
- I'm sorry I've not been up.
- Don't worry, I'll change after luncheon.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.595
I had to catch you
when you were all together.

28:06.630 --> 28:09.564
- How can we help, My Lady?
- It's a funny thing.

28:09.599 --> 28:12.463
Mr Crawley has heard Miss Swire
sent a letter

28:12.498 --> 28:16.618
on the day she died. If so, someone
must have posted it for her

28:16.653 --> 28:19.058
and we wondered
if it were any of you.

28:22.858 --> 28:27.938
I'm afraid not. Given that the poor
lady passed away that same day,

28:27.973 --> 28:32.023
an incident of this sort would have
been reported to me,

28:32.058 --> 28:34.409
- or to Mrs Hughes.
- That's right, milady.

28:34.325 --> 28:38.539
I see. Well, thank you very much.

28:41.418 --> 28:45.818
- What were that about?
- She wanted to know if anyone had posted a letter

28:45.853 --> 28:48.541
- for Miss Swire.
- Oh, I did that.

28:48.455 --> 28:50.744
Daisy, what did you say?

28:51.092 --> 28:56.179
Post miss Swire's letter. She asked me
to put it in the box in the hall.

28:56.778 --> 29:00.158
- Why?
- What were you doing in her room?

29:00.193 --> 29:03.905
Making up the fire. We started
talking, she'd written a letter.

29:03.940 --> 29:07.583
She was ever so nice. I still get
sad when I think about her.

29:07.618 --> 29:11.098
And it didn't occur to you to tell me?
- Tell you what?

29:11.133 --> 29:14.538
Never mind. I am grateful
to you, Daisy.

29:14.573 --> 29:16.578
You cannot know how much.

29:18.298 --> 29:22.018
- Well, this is the last of them.
- I'm glad they've hurried it

29:22.053 --> 29:24.063
so she can be married from Downton.

29:24.098 --> 29:28.698
Are you? A little sober reflection
would not have gone amiss.

29:28.733 --> 29:31.098
Mama, let's try to be positive.

29:31.978 --> 29:36.218
Of all of them, Anthony is the
most traditional choice.

29:36.253 --> 29:39.863
Robert, Edith is beginning her life
as an old man's drudge.

29:39.898 --> 29:44.303
I shouldn't think a large
drawing room much compensation.

29:44.338 --> 29:48.898
- Why dwell on that now?
- To have the pleasure of saying, "Told you so. "

29:51.258 --> 29:54.743
Now, the moment you feel tired,
you tell me,

29:54.778 --> 29:58.938
- I'll take over whatever it is you're doing.
- Oh, will you now?

29:58.973 --> 30:01.335
Are you sure you want
to come to the church?

30:01.370 --> 30:03.698
You could stay here
and have a lie down.

30:04.698 --> 30:08.183
It would be so nice

30:08.218 --> 30:13.538
if people would wait to learn if I
really am ill before boxing me up.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.063
I don't know what you mean?

30:16.098 --> 30:18.938
I don't know anything
about any illness.

30:18.973 --> 30:21.178
Don't you?

30:22.058 --> 30:23.938
I see.

30:26.418 --> 30:29.383
- Who told him?
- I don't know.

30:29.418 --> 30:33.338
Maybe he just picked it up somehow.
He's worried about you.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.498
He's a good man.
He's a hopeless liar.

30:36.533 --> 30:39.338
That's quite nice, really, isn't it?

30:42.658 --> 30:45.138
I've had a message from the doctor.

30:45.498 --> 30:47.618
He'll have the results tomorrow.

30:48.298 --> 30:50.498
I'm to call in the afternoon.

30:50.533 --> 30:52.783
Try not to worry.

30:52.818 --> 30:56.578
I'll try,
but I won't succeed.

31:03.618 --> 31:05.818
That's it, I'll put the hat on later.

31:05.853 --> 31:07.863
Go straight to Lady Edith.

31:07.898 --> 31:10.663
You look marvellous.
I feel marvellous.

31:10.698 --> 31:15.078
That is, I feel marvellous because
we don't have to leave Downton.

31:15.113 --> 31:19.565
Lavinia did write to her father
and it was posted from this house.

31:19.600 --> 31:24.018
In other words, every word Mr Swire
wrote in that letter was true.

31:29.458 --> 31:32.178
Daisy posted it.

31:32.213 --> 31:34.298
The kitchen maid.

31:38.458 --> 31:40.978
- I see.
- Do you, my darling?

31:41.738 --> 31:45.623
I hope so, because if you try
to find one more excuse

31:45.658 --> 31:49.738
not to accept the money, I'll have
to beat you about the head.

31:52.098 --> 31:53.938
I see.

31:57.058 --> 31:59.143
I do have one condition, however.

31:59.178 --> 32:02.903
- Make it a good one.
- Let's not steal Edith's thunder.

32:02.938 --> 32:06.107
I'll tell Robert after it's over
and she's left on honeymoon.

32:06.953 --> 32:08.753
Now, that I can live with.

32:22.499 --> 32:24.504
You look beautiful.

32:24.539 --> 32:28.019
All of us married. All of us happy.

32:29.099 --> 32:31.099
And the first baby on the way.

32:31.819 --> 32:36.819
Let's get a picture of the three
of us when we get to the church.

32:36.854 --> 32:40.899
He looks as if he's waiting for
a beating from the headmaster.

32:40.934 --> 32:43.384
Do you think I should reassure him?

32:43.419 --> 32:47.979
How? He's done it before so he must
be in possession of all the facts.

32:48.014 --> 32:52.299
Perhaps the first Lady Strallan
was a difficult act to follow.

32:52.334 --> 32:54.459
Or a difficult one to repeat.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.824
Well, fashionably late is one thing.

33:02.859 --> 33:07.739
Are we going in? Edith, I know
we haven't always got along,

33:07.774 --> 33:10.976
and I doubt things'll
change much in the future,

33:11.011 --> 33:14.179
but today I wish you
all the luck in the world.

33:15.219 --> 33:16.899
Thank you.

33:30.979 --> 33:32.939
Oh, look.

33:33.819 --> 33:35.659
Thank you very much.

34:09.059 --> 34:10.824
Good afternoon.

34:10.859 --> 34:12.859
Good afternoon, my sweet one.

34:25.379 --> 34:28.824
Dearly beloved, we are gathered...

34:28.859 --> 34:31.498
- I can't do this.
- What?

34:31.534 --> 34:33.498
I can't do it.

34:36.498 --> 34:39.859
- You know it's wrong, you said so.
- My dear chap...

34:39.893 --> 34:42.583
No, I shouldn't have
let it get this far.

34:42.619 --> 34:46.498
I should've stopped it long ago.
I tried to stop it.

34:46.534 --> 34:48.344
What are you saying?

34:48.379 --> 34:51.498
I don't understand
what you're saying.

34:51.534 --> 34:53.339
Edith...

34:54.699 --> 34:58.939
Edith, I can't let you throw away
your life like this.

34:58.974 --> 35:01.099
What do you mean?

35:02.099 --> 35:04.139
We're so happy, aren't we?

35:04.539 --> 35:08.299
We're going to be
so terribly, terribly happy.

35:09.579 --> 35:12.399
You are going to be happy,
I pray that you are,

35:12.434 --> 35:15.219
but only if you don't
waste yourself on me.

35:15.254 --> 35:17.456
Anthony, it is too late for this.

35:17.491 --> 35:19.624
Might I suggest we take a step back?

35:19.659 --> 35:23.304
No, let him go. Let him go.
You know he's right.

35:23.339 --> 35:27.499
Don't stop him doing the only
sensible thing in months.

35:27.534 --> 35:30.219
- Thank you, Lady Grantham.
- But Granny!

35:30.254 --> 35:32.419
It's over, dear, don't drag it out.

35:32.454 --> 35:35.264
Wish him well and let him go.

35:35.299 --> 35:38.979
- I can't.
- Goodbye, my dearest darling,

35:39.979 --> 35:42.019
and may God bless you...

35:42.054 --> 35:43.739
always.

35:44.539 --> 35:46.299
But...

36:06.779 --> 36:08.699
Oh, quick.

36:44.699 --> 36:48.264
When everyone gets back,
can you clear all this away?

36:48.299 --> 36:52.304
I want it gone before Lady Edith
comes downstairs. Everything.

36:52.339 --> 36:57.219
Ask the outside staff to help put
back the carpet and the furniture.

37:01.979 --> 37:03.927
Is there anything I could say
to make it better?

37:04.247 --> 37:05.351
No.

37:08.979 --> 37:12.784
Look at them, with their husbands...

37:12.819 --> 37:16.659
Sybil pregnant,
Mary probably pregnant.

37:16.694 --> 37:18.579
Just go!

37:19.379 --> 37:22.179
- I mean it, go!
- Perhaps you should go.

37:26.819 --> 37:28.739
Oh, Mama.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.739
You are being tested,

37:35.179 --> 37:37.739
and do you know what they say,
my darling?

37:39.379 --> 37:42.499
Being tested
only makes you stronger.

37:43.979 --> 37:46.059
I don't think it's working with me.

38:34.339 --> 38:37.499
- What shall we do now?
- There's nothing we can do

38:37.534 --> 38:39.856
beyond removing all signs
of a wedding

38:39.891 --> 38:42.179
and holding her hand
while she recovers.

38:42.214 --> 38:44.379
She will, of course.

38:45.059 --> 38:49.119
Meanwhile, it's time to face
the business of leaving Downton.

38:49.154 --> 38:53.166
Without the wedding to hide behind,
there's no reason to delay it

38:53.201 --> 38:57.179
and astonish the world with
the extent of my wretched failure.

38:57.699 --> 38:59.699
Actually,

39:00.419 --> 39:04.539
Mary and I intended to make
an announcement at dinner.

39:04.574 --> 39:08.659
- What announcement? What about?
- You don't have to leave.

39:10.019 --> 39:12.019
I'll explain it later, but...

39:12.459 --> 39:15.299
I'm going to give you
Reggie's money.

39:15.334 --> 39:19.019
I'll accept it. I'll give it to you.

39:22.459 --> 39:26.379
Don't be silly, you're not
going to give me any money.

39:26.414 --> 39:28.579
I am. You don't want to leave.

39:29.539 --> 39:31.459
Nor does Mary.

39:31.699 --> 39:33.779
Nor do any of us for that matter.

39:33.814 --> 39:35.979
I still won't take your money.

39:41.979 --> 39:45.744
What I will allow is for you
to invest in the place.

39:45.779 --> 39:49.779
If we stay, you'll share
the ownership, it'll be your house,

39:49.814 --> 39:53.064
your estate as much as mine.
We will be joint masters.

39:53.099 --> 39:57.219
And if you won't agree, I will sell
and it will all be your fault.

40:09.859 --> 40:13.499
I never thought I'd feel sorry
for an earl's daughter.

40:13.534 --> 40:16.339
All God's creatures
have their troubles.

40:18.299 --> 40:20.579
- Anna...
- Yes?

40:21.539 --> 40:25.379
Do you think it's right women
should say what they think?

40:27.419 --> 40:30.019
Speak out about romance
and everything?

40:31.099 --> 40:36.219
Well, things are changing for us
and the vote won't be long now

40:36.254 --> 40:39.504
so they must get used to us
speaking our minds.

40:39.539 --> 40:43.419
- But what?
- With most of the men I've ever met,

40:43.454 --> 40:45.584
if you started to court them,

40:45.619 --> 40:48.059
they'd be so terrified
they'd run a mile.

41:00.859 --> 41:05.699
- Has she had something to eat?
- Anna took up some sandwiches.

41:05.734 --> 41:08.064
She didn't touch a thing.

41:08.099 --> 41:13.419
That reminds me. Carson, I don't
want Edith to see any wedding food.

41:13.454 --> 41:18.774
Mrs Hughes and Anna are taking what's
left to Mr Travis tomorrow, for the poor.

41:18.828 --> 41:22.099
If the poor don't
want it, bring it over to me.

41:24.659 --> 41:28.739
- How can we help Edith?
- By finding her something to do.

41:36.699 --> 41:39.699
Is this all we're getting?
The pickety bits?

41:39.734 --> 41:42.464
Hardly. These are canapes, Alfred.

41:42.499 --> 41:46.419
For your first course,
truffle egg on toast, perhaps?

41:46.454 --> 41:48.064
Oysters a la russe.

41:48.099 --> 41:51.779
- Then what?
- There's lobster rissoles in mousseline sauce.

41:51.814 --> 41:56.019
Or calvados-glazed duckling.
Or maybe a little asparagus salad

41:56.054 --> 41:58.424
with Champagne saffron vinaigrette.

41:58.459 --> 42:01.719
When I think how
you've gone to such pains...

42:01.754 --> 42:05.306
What about the pain
of that poor girl upstairs?

42:05.341 --> 42:08.859
Jilted at the alter...
I couldn't stand the shame.

42:09.059 --> 42:11.584
Then it's lucky
no-one's ever asked you.

42:11.619 --> 42:15.919
Poor thing. How will she find
the strength to hold up her head?

42:15.954 --> 42:20.219
I'd have to run away and hide
in a place where no-one knew me.

42:20.254 --> 42:22.819
- She's well out of it.
- How can you say it?

42:22.854 --> 42:25.224
She's young, she's not bad looking,

42:25.259 --> 42:28.799
she could do much better
than that broken-down old crock.

42:28.834 --> 42:32.304
Sir Anthony may have betrayed
a daughter of this house

42:32.339 --> 42:36.699
but he doesn't deserve to be
addressed like that by a footman.

42:36.734 --> 42:40.539
Oh, I think he does.
Every bit of that and worse.

42:40.574 --> 42:43.224
Well, maybe just this once.

42:43.259 --> 42:47.859
Right, what's it to be? Lobster,
duck or asparagus?

42:47.894 --> 42:49.779
Is there any cheese?

43:07.819 --> 43:10.139
What would you like me to get you?

43:10.174 --> 43:12.139
A different life.

43:15.379 --> 43:18.539
Let me bring you up some breakfast.

43:18.574 --> 43:20.299
No.

43:23.299 --> 43:25.579
I'm a useless spinster,

43:25.979 --> 43:29.379
good at helping out,
that is my role,

43:30.259 --> 43:32.739
and spinsters get up for breakfast.

43:45.779 --> 43:48.819
- Going out?
- Just into the village.

43:48.854 --> 43:50.979
I... have to fetch something.

43:51.014 --> 43:52.944
Can I help?

43:52.979 --> 43:54.939
I'm going down later.

43:54.974 --> 43:56.899
No, thank you.

43:57.659 --> 44:00.499
This is an errand
I have to do for myself.

44:00.534 --> 44:02.219
Ready?

44:02.979 --> 44:05.059
As ready as I'll ever be.

44:35.379 --> 44:37.579
You can be sure of one thing.

44:37.614 --> 44:39.779
I won't be cured by standing here.

45:14.699 --> 45:16.699
- Do you want...
- No.

45:28.179 --> 45:30.179
Everything all right, Miss O'Brien?

45:34.059 --> 45:37.699
Oh, yes, everything's
all right with me,

45:38.179 --> 45:42.219
but it'll be all wrong with you
before too long, mark my words.

45:42.254 --> 45:44.499
Oh? And how is that, Miss O'Brien?

45:44.534 --> 45:47.059
I don't know, not yet,

45:47.094 --> 45:49.424
but it will be.

45:49.459 --> 45:51.459
You can be sure of it.

46:00.619 --> 46:02.339
Well?

46:03.379 --> 46:04.858
Is it or isn't it?

46:04.893 --> 46:09.248
It's not cancer. It's a benign
something or other. Nothing more.

46:11.739 --> 46:14.379
Don't mention
that you've said anything.

46:14.414 --> 46:16.419
She doesn't know that I know.

46:16.454 --> 46:18.299
I won't say a word.

46:24.299 --> 46:29.499
Did you tell him? I would prefer
to say I put him out of his misery.

46:38.379 --> 46:40.899
♪ Dashing away
with the smoothing iron

46:40.934 --> 46:42.744

46:42.779 --> 46:50.179
♪ Dashing away

46:50.214 --> 46:52.739
♪ She stole my heart away ♪

47:01.339 --> 47:04.099
I haven't had a letter
from Mr Bates in weeks.

47:04.134 --> 47:06.128
He wants me to make
a new life without him.

47:06.074 --> 47:11.179
- Am I to answer to you both?
- I have made an investment. That's all.

47:11.214 --> 47:15.176
You abandon a pregnant woman in a land
that is not her own while you run for it?!

47:15.211 --> 47:19.139
- Other men have normal families.
- No family is ever what it seems.

47:19.379 --> 47:22.619
- Tell them I'm all right.
- Sybil? Hello?
