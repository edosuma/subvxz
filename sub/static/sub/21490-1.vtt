08:50.871 --> 08:52.707
did Annette Bening's butt double people

08:52.708 --> 08:54.628
have any notes for next time?

08:55.104 --> 08:57.040
Extended Release, how was the doctor?

08:57.065 --> 08:59.721
Horrible. I maxed out
on antidepressants.

09:00.159 --> 09:02.142
- But it's Passover.
- Yeah, I know.

09:02.143 --> 09:03.519
How am I supposed to get through Seder

09:03.520 --> 09:04.939
without my little helper?

09:05.089 --> 09:06.690
How'd you know I was going out of town?

09:06.737 --> 09:08.279
No, no, no, I meant little helper,

09:08.280 --> 09:09.589
like slang for drugs.

09:09.614 --> 09:12.096
Like black beauties or Imagine Dragons.

09:12.121 --> 09:13.707
Or bennies. Bennies burritos.

09:13.708 --> 09:15.377
Dexies. Dexys Midnight Runners.

09:15.378 --> 09:17.547
Uppers, downers, East Enders, skins,

09:17.548 --> 09:19.719
Winonas, Puerto Rican French fries,

09:19.720 --> 09:21.640
Liza with a Zs, ludes,

09:21.641 --> 09:23.351
Crude ludes with attitudes...

09:23.920 --> 09:25.215
You're going out of town?

09:25.240 --> 09:27.275
- I just found out.
- Jesus Christ, Arthur!

09:27.276 --> 09:29.607
I haven't had to sit through
a family Seder by myself

09:29.632 --> 09:31.948
since I was a witch in college.
You know I depend on

09:31.973 --> 09:33.643
my mother's hatred of you to pull focus

09:33.707 --> 09:35.417
off my own wrongdoings.

09:35.418 --> 09:37.832
And I <i>love</i> being your human shield,

09:37.857 --> 09:38.966
but due to budget cuts,

09:38.967 --> 09:41.220
PBS had to relocate all our productions.

09:41.221 --> 09:42.974
Please tell me you're not going to L. A.

09:42.975 --> 09:45.103
I wish! Louisiana was too expensive.

09:45.104 --> 09:46.815
No, from here on in, we're
shooting everything

09:46.816 --> 09:48.526
at Burt Reynolds' old dinner theater

09:48.527 --> 09:49.836
in Jupiter, Florida.

09:50.071 --> 09:51.449
Oh, Jesus, Arthur!

09:51.450 --> 09:53.077
Why is this happening?

09:53.078 --> 09:54.563
I'll be back before you know it,

09:54.588 --> 09:56.381
and Billy will be at the Seder.

09:56.501 --> 09:58.463
[phone buzzes]

09:58.758 --> 10:00.593
- Hey.
- Good news, bad news.

10:00.594 --> 10:01.970
I'm warming up for Larry Wilmore,

10:01.971 --> 10:03.264
and I can't come to Seder.

10:03.265 --> 10:05.018
Oh, fuck!

10:05.542 --> 10:07.087
Wait, which is which?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.079
Thanks for volunteering

10:09.104 --> 10:10.142
here at the Children's Hospital.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.289
Well, it was mandatory,

10:11.314 --> 10:12.790
part of our community
service requirement.

10:12.814 --> 10:15.547
But it's nice to finally have
a pair of shoes that fits me.

10:15.572 --> 10:17.185
You're gonna brighten up some lives!

10:17.210 --> 10:18.294
These kids are at an age

10:18.295 --> 10:19.461
where they don't know yet

10:19.486 --> 10:20.735
to be scared of clowns.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.102
I want a clown name,

10:22.127 --> 10:24.700
you know, just a big,
goofy, harmless clown,

10:24.725 --> 10:26.227
someone who doesn't upset anybody,

10:26.228 --> 10:28.659
totally unmemorable, no edge.

10:29.744 --> 10:32.072
Hey, kid, I'm Go-Go!

10:32.073 --> 10:34.284
- And I'm Mario Lopez.
- [lisping] And we're here

10:34.285 --> 10:37.734
to make your last hours on
Earth a little sillier!

10:37.861 --> 10:39.406
[toot toot]

10:44.684 --> 10:46.935
So do you have any jokes?

10:47.215 --> 10:48.654
Maybe we can read you
some of our tweets.

10:48.678 --> 10:50.321
- Oh, that's a good idea.
- 'Cause we've written those already...

10:50.345 --> 10:51.536
Those are already out there.

10:51.561 --> 10:53.648
Yeah, exactly. You can't steal them.

10:53.673 --> 10:56.083
- Uh... no.
- Too obscure.

10:56.325 --> 10:58.323
Oh, here's one. You know Elmo, right?

10:58.348 --> 10:59.711
Here's one about the
guy who played Elmo.

10:59.712 --> 11:01.649
Oh, no, no. Maybe no tweets.

11:01.997 --> 11:03.802
Hey, kid, um...

11:04.176 --> 11:06.247
how long did the doctor
give you to live?

11:06.272 --> 11:08.231
I have a broken leg.

11:08.684 --> 11:10.106
From the cancer?

11:10.262 --> 11:12.444
No. I went on a ski trip.

11:12.614 --> 11:14.782
You're not dying? And you're rich?

11:14.783 --> 11:16.645
Well, fuck this!

11:17.121 --> 11:19.667
- Ooh, chocolates.
- Hey, that's mine.

11:19.787 --> 11:21.935
Yeah. Come over and stop me.

11:23.396 --> 11:25.428
Are you clowns gonna do anything?

11:25.429 --> 11:27.505
I'll sign your fucking cast.

11:28.630 --> 11:30.070
You know what we can
do to fill the time?

11:30.094 --> 11:32.586
- Hmm?
- We can brainstorm some ways

11:32.611 --> 11:34.739
for you not to jump off
the ledge during Seder.

11:34.850 --> 11:38.204
Okay. Non-pharmaceutical
ways of dealing with stress.

11:38.205 --> 11:40.375
My mom goes to our
Sausalito house sometimes

11:40.376 --> 11:42.045
to meditate with Oprah.

11:42.046 --> 11:44.174
- Oh, shut up, Baby Warbucks.
- Wait a minute.

11:44.175 --> 11:45.438
Meditation, though?

11:45.463 --> 11:47.329
That's just napping, right?
I can do that!

11:47.354 --> 11:49.537
You need to get yourself one
of those meditation apps.

11:49.670 --> 11:50.910
That way, you can be one of those people

11:50.934 --> 11:52.337
who feels superior to other people

11:52.362 --> 11:55.049
- because you meditate.
- Yes, brilliant. I'll try it. Okay.

11:55.127 --> 11:57.189
Great news, kid... I left
you the creams and jellies

11:57.213 --> 11:58.260
in this chocolate assortment.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.831
Bad news... I'm taking the rest of it.

11:59.971 --> 12:02.712
Look! Mario Lopez signed your cast.

12:10.574 --> 12:12.661
You still owe me 10 bucks
for "Inland Empire."

12:13.162 --> 12:15.666
No. Ooh!

12:18.953 --> 12:20.998
Hey, it's me, Danny Aiello.

12:20.999 --> 12:23.127
- Are you ready to meditate?
- Yeah!

12:23.128 --> 12:25.006
What a coincidence. So the hell am I.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.218
Okay, pally, do me a favor

12:27.219 --> 12:29.473
and get yourself in a
comfortable position

12:29.474 --> 12:31.644
and take some deep breaths.

12:31.645 --> 12:34.776
[breathing deeply]

How do you feel?

12:43.920 --> 12:46.925
Pretty relaxed, huh? Atta girl!

12:46.926 --> 12:50.933
Now you're all meditated,
with me, Danny Aiello.

12:50.934 --> 12:52.269
Bye!

12:54.557 --> 12:56.165
Happy Passover, Mom.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.782
Julie, why are you late?

12:58.807 --> 13:01.166
You know, it's funny. I've
been losing track of time

13:01.191 --> 13:02.413
since I started meditating.

13:02.414 --> 13:05.419
And I've been losing money too.
Is that how that works?

13:05.420 --> 13:07.215
- As a mental health profession...
- Okay, enough!

13:07.216 --> 13:10.221
Your father is stuck on the
BQE with a fruit platter.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.267
I told him to put Waze on the phone.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.548
He says, "No. It takes
up too much memory."

13:14.573 --> 13:17.778
What's he doing on his
phone, making documentaries?

13:17.779 --> 13:19.198
[door closes]

13:21.996 --> 13:24.374
BOTH: Oh, fuck.

13:24.573 --> 13:26.588
Hi, Aunt Bonnie!

13:26.589 --> 13:28.465
Hi, Julie.

13:28.466 --> 13:29.677
Marilyn.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.430
Hello, Bonnie.

13:31.431 --> 13:33.142
You're looking very well.

13:33.276 --> 13:35.338
It's natural to expect
a little weight gain,

13:35.363 --> 13:37.084
considering all the damage

13:37.109 --> 13:39.404
the cocaine's done to your metabolism.

13:39.405 --> 13:42.410
Oh, don't worry. I'll
work it off with sex.

13:42.411 --> 13:44.749
- You remember sex, Marilyn.
- Yes, I do, Bonnie.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.713
You never forget your little
sister's first paying job.

13:47.714 --> 13:49.174
Oh, you dirty bitch.

13:49.175 --> 13:50.330
Hey, come on, Lola,

13:50.355 --> 13:52.438
I got two potato chip
sandwiches up for table three.

13:52.463 --> 13:54.244
I know Billy's at his stupid new job,

13:54.269 --> 13:56.448
but where the fuck is Matthew?

13:57.330 --> 13:59.729
Matthew. You are two hours late!

14:00.065 --> 14:02.468
And you look like Sal
Mineo went to a Hot Topic

14:02.493 --> 14:04.287
right before he was murdered.

14:04.471 --> 14:07.043
Uh, so? I don't got parents no more.

14:07.044 --> 14:09.173
So I don't gotta do nothin' nobody says.

14:09.198 --> 14:11.079
I had candy for breakfast this morning.

14:11.104 --> 14:12.680
I don't even give a care!

14:12.681 --> 14:14.579
Is this about you losing your parents?

14:14.604 --> 14:15.978
That happened on Tuesday.

14:15.979 --> 14:17.773
You're milking this like it had titties!

14:18.299 --> 14:19.915
And, yeah, as a transwoman,

14:19.940 --> 14:22.741
I can engage in provocative
biological discourse.

14:22.742 --> 14:25.371
This is insane! Nine-Minute
Lunch, my ass!

14:25.372 --> 14:27.500
Like, where is my cold
cut and grape salad?

14:27.501 --> 14:29.087
All right, all right. Matthew.

14:29.088 --> 14:30.548
Mattman.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.385
Mattman, we know you're upset,

14:32.410 --> 14:33.940
but we need you to help out.

14:33.965 --> 14:35.785
Do you think you could wait some tables?

14:35.810 --> 14:38.272
You're <i>not</i> my father!

14:38.666 --> 14:40.065
Oh, my God.

about our out-of-control teen?

of the funniest Larrys

just want to stay on the air.

Let me tell you what
America loves on TV.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.663
Party games with celebrities,

15:27.664 --> 15:29.625
and interviews with
precocious little kids

15:29.626 --> 15:31.336
by black men over 40.

15:31.337 --> 15:32.714
You're right. Steve Harvey.

15:32.715 --> 15:34.551
Bill Cosby.

15:34.552 --> 15:36.753
- Bill Cosby?
- When it comes to doing

15:36.778 --> 15:38.267
"the darndest things"...

15:38.268 --> 15:40.437
You think drugging women
and having sex with them

15:40.438 --> 15:42.609
while they're asleep is a...
"darndest thing"?

15:42.880 --> 15:45.652
- It's not <i>not</i> the darndest.
- No. No, it's not.

15:45.677 --> 15:47.481
Why don't we leave
Larry alone for a sec.

- Okay.

Two days ago, I was serving
mozzarella sticks,

15:52.057 --> 15:53.983
and now I am rifting with Larry Wilmore!

15:54.008 --> 15:56.136
This is crazy! I have a
question, by the way.

15:56.137 --> 15:57.692
Do I do my stand-up right at the top?

15:57.717 --> 15:59.237
Because I have a tight 15 minutes

15:59.262 --> 16:00.687

16:00.688 --> 16:02.856
Hey, don't worry about your "stand-up."

16:02.881 --> 16:05.218
Your job is to psych up those people.

Come over here, clown.

16:07.598 --> 16:09.339
Look at this. See this?

16:09.364 --> 16:12.210
This is a CD. This is for
the booty-shaking contest.

16:12.211 --> 16:14.715
This is a cannon that
shoots out T-shirts.

16:14.716 --> 16:16.044
- Okay.
- These are the T-shirts.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.412
- Guess where they go?
- In the cannon.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.063
In the cannon. What is this right here?

16:19.088 --> 16:20.958
These are snacks for
those animals up there.

16:20.983 --> 16:22.745
And these are the two
most important things.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.525
This is the prank call templates,

16:24.526 --> 16:26.656

16:26.657 --> 16:28.618

Clapter. That's when one of
your jokes doesn't work,

you don't get a laugh, you
say something very obvious

16:32.752 --> 16:34.672
that everyone understands is correct.

16:34.673 --> 16:35.935
That way, at least you get applause.

Oh, Julie, please, just eat.

a great replacement,
